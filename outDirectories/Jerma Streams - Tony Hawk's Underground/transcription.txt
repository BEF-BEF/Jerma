[0.70s -> 7.30s]  Hey. Yeah, we're early. Very early, actually. Almost an hour early.
[8.98s -> 15.70s]  Uh, I'm just, I'm ready. I'm ready. You know how sometimes I tell you guys that sometimes
[15.70s -> 24.04s]  I sit here and I'm just all set up. Things work. Everything's ready to go. And it's like 45 minutes
[24.04s -> 33.13s]  to stream time. No, no, no, no, no. We're going now. I'm ready now. I'm that kind of person where
[33.21s -> 41.29s]  I've had a show and I went on stage and the show was seven o'clock. People are funneling in at like
[41.29s -> 48.02s]  six 30 getting their seats. I, if I was ready, I would just come out and just start talking to
[48.02s -> 53.80s]  people. It's like, Hey, I'm, I'm ready to start my show. I was, I would be, can I have a mic?
[53.80s -> 57.24s]  And I would just, it'd be addressing people as they walked in to get their seats.
[58.22s -> 61.66s]  And then it'd be like, all right, six, it's like, it's seven o'clock. All right, now we can do the
[61.66s -> 69.88s]  show. It would be pissed to start the show like 40 minutes early. People walk in. It's 20 minutes
[69.88s -> 76.14s]  till the show's over. Oh, sorry, guys. I really just had to, I really wanted to start. Be like,
[77.50s -> 89.00s]  Dickhead, these tickets were $285. They're in the front row and it says there's a meet and greet
[89.00s -> 97.77s]  after. Is that still happening? I don't feel like doing that anymore. Dude, I got free tickets to
[97.77s -> 103.85s]  the Jerma string. Yeah. Well, we had to start giving them away free because I didn't really
[103.85s -> 108.84s]  get any money to come and pay for it. Anyways, we're gonna play Tony Hawk's Underground today.
[108.84s -> 118.44s]  It's all ready to go. It works. This is, if you're wondering the platform, this is X-Box,
[120.10s -> 126.82s]  X-Box that has been upscaled to 1080 through backwards compatibility with 360.
[127.78s -> 134.17s]  That's where we're at. That's why I'm playing it in 360. It should look a little crusty,
[134.17s -> 138.25s]  but not too crusty where it's gonna be annoying. I don't know. We'll find out.
[139.45s -> 144.28s]  Just say you pirated it. Just say you pirated it. No one will care.
[145.56s -> 149.98s]  I didn't. I got a 360 right next to me. I had to get a 360 hard drive.
[150.78s -> 159.80s]  I'm playing this on a 360 right now. That's what it is. But there's not much else to say besides,
[159.80s -> 169.78s]  here we go. By the way, I think I'm gonna keep original music. So this entire VOD is gonna be
[169.78s -> 178.68s]  deleted. There might be like 10 seconds of this VOD that is watchable. I'm really sorry, those of
[178.68s -> 185.43s]  you that are VOD watchers. But the last time we did this, we played Tony Hawk 2. No, don't,
[185.43s -> 192.57s]  spoilers. We played Tony Hawk 2 and I think I muted the music and it just fucked it all up.
[193.37s -> 200.12s]  It just didn't feel right. It felt off. Is there skateboarding in this game?
[200.92s -> 208.60s]  Yep. No, you didn't. Oh, so Jeremy lied about turning the music off in
[209.40s -> 214.84s]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for the Dreamcast. I don't think you can even make a username that long,
[214.84s -> 222.70s]  so don't even try it. All right, I'm ready. Let's go. So there's the story mode. I'm gonna
[222.70s -> 228.62s]  do the story mode because that's obviously the easiest thing to do. I need to make a skater too,
[228.62s -> 241.66s]  don't I? Let's create a skater to use in story mode. Stream will be chugging in just a moment.
[242.62s -> 253.46s]  Please up the game volume. Oh, let's see what it looks like first. All right, so
[255.22s -> 263.80s]  create new, create a new skater. That's like a Neversoft developer. Okay. Any unsaved changes
[263.80s -> 267.16s]  to your current story that don't matter. All right, pre-made skaters.
[272.86s -> 291.32s]  Pre-made Steve, Becky, Mike, Jim, Chad, Joey, Sheena, Josh, Andy, Liz, Jack. Are these all
[291.32s -> 305.78s]  game devs? These might be game devs. The suit, Tiger Swallow, Big Lion, Green Chick, Big Pimp,
[306.34s -> 319.75s]  Big Pimpin', Big Pimpin' Eddie. Well, I want to make a, I want to make one. All right,
[319.75s -> 330.71s]  head information, name, custom skater, age 16. I had sucks to do this. You know what I mean?
[331.27s -> 336.15s]  I remember playing games when it was on Xbox or PlayStation. It was like, yeah, all right.
[337.19s -> 348.23s]  I'm done. All right. That hurts. Stance. I would pick Goofy, but Goofy just means left,
[348.79s -> 356.84s]  lefty, right? I'm just going to regular. Push. Never Mongo. Mongo Switch. Always Mongo.
[357.80s -> 369.98s]  I don't know what these mean. What's just default? Never Mongo. Do not push. Always Mongo. Always
[369.98s -> 379.40s]  Mongo. Full Mongo. What does that mean though? What is always Mongo? What is Mongo? I don't know
[379.40s -> 386.20s]  what Mongo is. Tricks. Street. I like going up high, but I also like manual too. So we're going
[386.20s -> 400.01s]  to street. I gotta, I gotta Google what this is. What is Mongo? What is Mongo? Mongo skateboarding.
[403.69s -> 409.45s]  The Mongo push. A stupid way to skateboard. A person skates Mongo if they use their leading foot
[410.49s -> 416.17s]  in the front while riding to push. While they are pushing, the back foot stays near the rear
[416.17s -> 421.86s]  of the board and they push with their front foot. So Mongo is a stupid way to skateboard. This is
[421.86s -> 430.22s]  the official definition. Is it bad to ride Mongo on a skateboard? It's a bad habit. Okay. Never Mongo.
[433.02s -> 443.24s]  Goofy. Always Mongo. Okay. Never Mongo. Regular Stance. Hometown. What the fuck? Las Vegas.
[445.86s -> 458.12s]  Uh, yeah. I wasn't born in Las Vegas. You're right. Fuck. I was. All right. How do I do shit?
[458.12s -> 469.82s]  Shit. Boston. Do I have to do Boston mass? No. Where did you know where that is? Custom name.
[474.30s -> 477.82s]  Me? No, it's going to have to be like some fucked up like frog person.
[487.78s -> 509.83s]  Ernie. I think I like Ernie. Ernie is a Mongo name. Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. Ernie. It's
[509.83s -> 519.00s]  Bernie. It's Ernie. All right. Ernie. I don't have a last name. I'm just Ernie. No, I'm just Ernie.
[519.00s -> 527.00s]  All right. Well, Ernie isn't 34. That's not even me. So I can change these. Whatever. 40 from Boston.
[527.00s -> 558.81s]  Ernie. Head options. Face. Can I rotate? Okay. Can I? Whoa. Gray. Gray skin. Gray. Eyes. All right.
[559.45s -> 566.41s]  I can't do eyes. That's going to fuck me up. Yeah. That's the... What was that game that Ubisoft came
[566.41s -> 573.94s]  out with? That was a fucking mess. It was like a... What was it? It was a... What's it called?
[573.94s -> 579.08s]  Assassin's Creed Unity. Yes. That's the one. This is every YouTuber's thumbnail for an Assassin's
[579.08s -> 595.54s]  Creed Unity video. I mean, I would have done it. I think I like a gray skin. Let's see what else
[595.54s -> 604.73s]  we can do. Hold on. Wait. Oh, that doesn't... I can just be blue.
[610.02s -> 617.96s]  Okay. What is Ernie? I think... I don't know if I want to just be like a wacky color or something.
[617.96s -> 630.79s]  You know what I mean? No. I don't want to be like orange or like blue. I don't want to be like
[630.79s -> 642.28s]  lime green. Let's take this set to a value. I can be like a glow stick.
[642.92s -> 658.76s]  All right. How about... Should I be a glow stick? I don't know. Let's force a neighbor. All right.
[658.76s -> 663.48s]  Fine. I'll be a glow stick. I'm going to... No, no, no. I'm going to get... I'm going to hate that
[663.48s -> 667.96s]  after like fucking three hours. All right. How about kind of glow stick? Like how about just sick?
[668.12s -> 669.08s]  Like how about just sick?
[679.85s -> 680.65s]  Just look back here.
[686.68s -> 692.01s]  It's my hair. Middle part. No, no, no.
[697.67s -> 703.03s]  Comb over. No, this is all too easy. It has to... It's too easy.
[705.70s -> 708.10s]  Medium, medium. Actually, I kind of like this one.
[713.11s -> 724.23s]  Spike long. No, no. I kind of like clown hair. No, I don't. Literally spikes is what I thought
[724.23s -> 733.05s]  that said. Pompadour. I like it. Eraser hair. I think I like the pompadour.
[733.05s -> 743.46s]  How do I do a hair color? Make it the same color as my skin.
[744.90s -> 754.31s]  I'm not sure I can even replicate it again.
[765.42s -> 769.02s]  Shrek 5. Zoomer Shrek.
[769.66s -> 786.86s]  No, I don't want it. I don't like this. How about... All right. Let's do middle part.
[796.09s -> 799.13s]  That's fine. I don't care. Whatever.
[799.93s -> 824.44s]  It's just my hair. Facial hair. Beard. Mustache. Long sideburns. Honest Abe.
[828.41s -> 829.53s]  Did it be honest Abe?
[836.41s -> 844.65s]  Just looks like he has a helmet on. Chinless Abe. Okay. Just looks like he has a weird helmet on.
[845.21s -> 857.58s]  It's going to be lower saturation.
[871.43s -> 878.76s]  It's just wearing a scarf with your own hair. Is this a... Okay. Is this a hairstyle?
[881.34s -> 884.46s]  Having your hair go all the way down to the bottom and come all the way to the right?
[884.46s -> 888.62s]  Is this like the wearing a helmet of your own hair style?
[891.02s -> 911.50s]  Can't get the color exact. That's close. That's good. That's good. That's all right. That looks
[911.50s -> 938.06s]  good. That looks fine. Hats. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I already have a helmet on.
[938.78s -> 953.19s]  No. No. No. No. How about the dunce? Okay. I like that one. I like the dunce hat. I get to be the
[953.19s -> 961.03s]  guy that wears the dunce hat today. Hold on. Let's see the others. Viking helmet. British officer.
[961.59s -> 970.15s]  A British bobby. Oh, I kind of like this too. That's so stupid.
[973.19s -> 982.02s]  If I could wear a wizard hat. But if I do a wizard hat, then I have to be a wizard.
[988.50s -> 994.46s]  What about the earmuffs? Just be a wizard. But I have to do like a big long wizard beard. No,
[994.46s -> 1004.98s]  I don't want to do that. It's too... I'm going dunce. Can you even make a long beard?
[1010.44s -> 1019.48s]  Can you even make a long beard? Let's see.
[1021.88s -> 1025.08s]  Facial hair. Let's go. Beard. No, you can't.
[1026.28s -> 1030.20s]  It's just painted on. Guys, this game came out in like 2004. 2003.
[1030.20s -> 1044.52s]  No. We're going to have to go dunce.
[1054.04s -> 1067.24s]  Or actually, I like the earmuffs. The earmuffs to me are funnier. I'm going earmuffs. Wait, paper bag.
[1079.03s -> 1093.00s]  But no, no, that sucked. That's just the eyes with more space. Dastardly Richard.
[1101.22s -> 1102.58s]  I might be able to make it pretty close.
[1107.34s -> 1114.78s]  See if I can. Damn it. I can't put glasses on the front.
[1115.58s -> 1127.62s]  Okay, we got shirt style. It could be pretty close.
[1149.58s -> 1150.86s]  There you go. You're going to think it's blue.
[1150.86s -> 1158.70s]  You sure it's not? No, it's blue.
[1173.93s -> 1174.73s]  Make it darker.
[1174.73s -> 1184.52s]  Make it a little too dark. Yeah, it's all right, though. It ended up being perfect.
[1185.48s -> 1193.08s]  It's a zipper hoodie, you fake fan. I can't. Well, you want me to go through every offer to
[1193.08s -> 1205.82s]  find the zipper hoodie? And that's not even true. Dick Dastardly Richard. That's not a zipper hoodie.
[1206.54s -> 1223.88s]  It's not a hoodie. Who's the fake fan? It's this, but long sleeve because there are no zippers.
[1224.44s -> 1242.62s]  It's not a hoodie. It's just a jacket. This is actually, it's probably pretty damn close.
[1242.62s -> 1256.71s]  Let's see. Suit coat? No. All right. Remember jogger jacket? I think jogger jacket's the one.
[1257.43s -> 1278.65s]  It's got to make it weird and light blue and splotchy. I mean, the reason why that shirt looks so
[1279.61s -> 1289.43s]  different and odd is because it's a game from 1995. I can't add a Nintendo 64 pixels.
[1290.07s -> 1301.83s]  It's a little lighter than that. It's like this. That's close. This is close enough.
[1301.83s -> 1306.94s]  All right. Now the second color. Oh, I can't even make it the second color. It's all right.
[1307.74s -> 1317.06s]  Close enough. What about gloves? Spike neck? Wristband? What do you gloves?
[1318.76s -> 1332.22s]  Wrist tape? Elbow band? No. Gloves. Here we go. Gloves. Can't wear gloves.
[1337.53s -> 1343.93s]  Does it go some green or something? I can't believe this is actually kind of working.
[1343.93s -> 1351.77s]  All right. These are, they're white, but they're pixelated and crappy and smudged with
[1352.73s -> 1360.14s]  42 kilobyte, like yellow and brown pixels. So we're going to go zebra like it is in the video.
[1360.86s -> 1385.34s]  I can't make these longer. Hmm. Suit pants. Jogger. Oh, he's just going to be in a jogging suit.
[1386.14s -> 1410.22s]  Oh, he's in white. He's got a stripe going down in his boots. He's got these red
[1414.87s -> 1420.89s]  bare feet. Oh, it's too bad. I can't make him in bare feet. If I make these red, it'll be fine.
[1421.53s -> 1438.34s]  Anything chunkier than this? He's a chunky. Well, then this guy's not Ernie anymore.
[1438.34s -> 1447.67s]  This is not Ernie. This is Dick Dastardly Richard.
[1452.54s -> 1464.57s]  All right. These are boots. There we go. What happened to Ernie? Like that's, I want Ernie.
[1469.99s -> 1484.81s]  Fuck Ernie. Head top. Wait, you can. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We can't see any of this.
[1484.81s -> 1495.48s]  Wait, you can. What? Nope. No, the fucking head's coming off. That's coming off. Ernie can be a big
[1495.48s -> 1503.22s]  fan of Dick Dastardly Richard. This is coming off. He's just, he just dresses as him because he
[1503.22s -> 1528.94s]  likes that video. No, if you tell me I have full on scale, face scaling options. What? How big?
[1528.94s -> 1536.98s]  I don't want to be too huge. No, this is not, this is not Dick Dastardly Richard's origin story.
[1537.94s -> 1553.67s]  This is Ernie the fan. He can make a mega mine. Head top. Where's this going? Oh, okay. Let's do
[1553.67s -> 1566.95s]  it this way. At least don't make him green. We'll fix it. Hold on. Yeah, this, this is big fan Ernie.
[1568.15s -> 1592.70s]  Big fan Ernie. That's what his name is changing to. Super wide. Big head funny. His head's not that
[1592.70s -> 1618.46s]  big. His head's not even that big. But it is funny though. Why is it? His head's not even that big.
[1618.94s -> 1652.81s]  Y'all. All right, that's too extreme though. That's way too extreme. Yeah, I don't want him to have
[1652.81s -> 1678.10s]  like an orc mouth. How about, all right, that's okay. Chest. Oh, shit. Make him, make him like
[1678.10s -> 1707.43s]  an ant. All right, I like this. This big gross stomach. A tiny, tiny chest. Wink. Hold on. Big
[1707.51s -> 1719.16s]  biceps. Forearms. Yeah, I don't, I gotta take the beard off too. It just looks stupid.
[1722.04s -> 1748.15s]  Huge hands. Or small hands. We gotta make him kind of like a pear. All right. Why's the jaw look
[1748.15s -> 1773.37s]  still so strange? Without the facial hair. Okay, I think it's good. I think it's good.
[1774.33s -> 1798.62s]  Big fan Ernie, I think is good. He's an alien. All right, we got it. We're done. Scale options.
[1798.62s -> 1811.42s]  Body. That's good. You can just make him roll. Okay. I'm doing any of this stuff. Who cares?
[1811.42s -> 1823.27s]  Wait, does it matter? Helmet. No, who cares? Does big fan Ernie need to be protected?
[1824.07s -> 1834.54s]  All right. Big fan Ernie can wear knee pads. These look like metal shackles.
[1835.34s -> 1851.64s]  Not knee pads. How big are the elbow pads? I can't even wear elbow pads. He has cow legs.
[1857.22s -> 1873.67s]  I'm gonna be so safe. Okay, that's fine. I'm done. I can't unseat the cow.
[1873.67s -> 1875.91s]  I cannot unseat the cow legs now that you said that.
[1884.90s -> 1898.28s]  Information. Big fan Ernie. Well, how about bovine Ernie? That's not bad either.
[1899.00s -> 1915.51s]  I think I'm gonna go with, I'm going with bovine Ernie. Can't wait for this guy to get instantly
[1915.51s -> 1928.57s]  eliminated in the next rumble. He's gonna have zero stats. Bovine Ernie. I think he's
[1928.57s -> 1931.13s]  however late on the screen. All right. Bovine Ernie. There he is.
[1933.61s -> 1940.01s]  From whatever. He could be like my neighbor or something. I don't care. How high can this go?
[1940.97s -> 1952.82s]  45. Okay. Done. Okay. Save skater. Let's see those legs.
[1955.46s -> 1962.26s]  Bovine Ernie. All right. Here we go. Let's start a career.
[1963.22s -> 1979.67s]  He saved. Should have been Dick Dastardly Richard. Well, it's, it's bovine Ernie.
[1980.92s -> 1988.68s]  New story. Begin at normal. I'm not doing 2003 hard. No, I'm doing normal.
[1989.48s -> 1999.30s]  2003 hard is 2020 like insane impossible. Let's go.
[2011.75s -> 2016.31s]  Muska is actually coming to this dump for a skate demo. Get dressed. Let's go.
[2018.07s -> 2026.73s]  I am dressed. I'm already dressed in my shackles.
[2028.49s -> 2034.65s]  Oh, I just got my ride all set up. What? They talk sort of looks like that thing's held together
[2034.65s -> 2050.10s]  with duct tape. Let's go skate. I didn't know they actually spoke. He's fully voice acted.
[2051.06s -> 2057.86s]  Home sweet home. What a dump. At least it has some killer spots. The old pool down by the high school
[2057.86s -> 2064.10s]  scab land, the drainage ditch on the south side of town street, our own little strip of paradise
[2064.10s -> 2071.29s]  complete with drug dealers who hate skateboarders. Well, I got to turn the volume up now.
[2072.49s -> 2076.81s]  Get ready. Check this out. Oh, by the way. Yeah. Again, this whole thing's going to get muted just
[2076.81s -> 2085.30s]  in case you didn't know. It's definitely been looked at bad on Xbox 360. All right, let's talk.
[2086.58s -> 2095.50s]  What up, Eric? Hey, help me out here. I need help with. I was just skating mind in my own
[2095.50s -> 2099.42s]  and the dealers grabbed my board. They tore it apart and they threw the pieces up on the roof.
[2100.30s -> 2104.22s]  My knees wrecked. Could you grab them for me? I got to go. I got to get on the roof.
[2104.30s -> 2114.06s]  Oh, man. Yeah, I'll hold your death. Use A to jump and R to grab onto stuff and then pull yourself
[2114.06s -> 2120.38s]  up. Press A to continue. So you jump, but you hold it. R is grab on stuff. I'm actually walking
[2120.38s -> 2128.94s]  around. I forget everything about this game. The next part should be on the house across the alley.
[2128.94s -> 2147.14s]  Jump. We can grab the gutter piece. Okay. Last part is on top of your house.
[2151.58s -> 2154.94s]  Hey, well, I'm getting my right set up again. Let's see if you are a couple of things.
[2157.24s -> 2161.08s]  You can get off the board to get over terrain that would normally be hard or impossible to
[2161.08s -> 2166.84s]  skate over. So you can get off the board. Is it L? Give this a try. Get off your board,
[2166.84s -> 2175.86s]  then jump over the barriers. What button is that? What? What is that like weird moon or like cute?
[2175.86s -> 2189.56s]  What is that? What button is that? Is it LBs? Okay. Run and jump over each barrier to get on.
[2189.56s -> 2198.79s]  Okay. So that's left bumper. Good job. Now jump up while running and then grind on the barrier.
[2202.92s -> 2215.13s]  Jump and wait. There it is. Okay. Beating stat challenges will increase your skating abilities.
[2215.13s -> 2218.25s]  Pause the game and go to the view stats menu to see a list of the challenges.
[2220.57s -> 2238.31s]  I think I got those knee pads on. Wait, what's that? Oh, this is like, this is shit to do
[2238.31s -> 2244.39s]  everywhere. What's this one? What are you doing? You psyched to see Muska's demo? Yeah. Bet you
[2244.39s -> 2252.76s]  are. Hey, since you punks aren't in school, why don't you go put up some flyers? Oh, I got to
[2252.76s -> 2261.26s]  put flyers up. Try to hit all the telephone poles. Why does that name sound fake in 2020?
[2261.26s -> 2278.66s]  You know what I mean? Like Chad Muska. The audio is delayed. Shouldn't be. Is it delayed?
[2290.06s -> 2295.66s]  So what you're hearing the sound after I move. Well, it should be going click, click, click,
[2295.66s -> 2313.18s]  click, click. It's not. It's barely fine. It's good. It's a little delayed. The video is slow.
[2313.90s -> 2344.39s]  I don't know why that is. Let me try one thing. How does this change it? Yeah, just that delayed
[2344.39s -> 2348.07s]  the audio for like a hundred milliseconds. All right, let's do it. So pick up the flyers.
[2349.27s -> 2355.48s]  All right, I got to get back into the Tony Hawk spirit here.
[2374.42s -> 2400.97s]  Oh shit. Did I win? I think I won. Yeah, I'm good. I love springing together. Oh, I missed it. I
[2400.97s -> 2414.92s]  missed it. Ah, good. Get you done prancing on and off your board. Let's actually escape.
[2417.98s -> 2425.61s]  At least I'm not too gimp to prance. How's your knee? I'll show you. So you land this.
[2427.13s -> 2445.64s]  Do a melon in the drainage dish. Oh, that was fucking pathetic. Oh, there's blood.
[2445.64s -> 2448.52s]  There's blood. Do a melon. I didn't. But did I not do a melon?
[2448.52s -> 2458.92s]  I flexed way too hard. I flexed too hard. Did I not do a melon?
[2472.38s -> 2488.28s]  A melon then revert to R as you land. Yeah, revert.
[2489.54s -> 2494.42s]  That's it. Enough warming up. You can't beat my score and you know it. What's right?
[2495.06s -> 2499.30s]  You see people at the skate park or like the ice skating rinks and anywhere that there's a
[2500.26s -> 2504.34s]  skill like the white, the ground is made out of moving material. What's going on?
[2505.54s -> 2508.66s]  What's your score? Beat Eric's score. We'll give him a head start.
[2510.47s -> 2520.55s]  Ooh, a thousand points. What else can you do? Wow. Really nice, man. Oh, I can't keep,
[2520.55s -> 2547.77s]  I can't like leave the area. I'll beat him. Don't worry. I'm trying so hard.
[2553.21s -> 2564.87s]  I'm still in the lead. All right. I'm just going to play. Oh shit. Eric's going to win.
[2580.01s -> 2600.87s]  Let's go. I gave him a head start. That was stupid. That's enough warming up. All right.
[2600.87s -> 2630.36s]  Let's go. Oh, why? Why is he fucking kicking my ass?
[2644.81s -> 2654.68s]  What? Why is he doing so much better this time? And you guys wanted me to do this on sick. No
[2654.68s -> 2670.76s]  fucking way. Losing to Eric. Wait a second. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2670.76s -> 2685.02s]  wait. I don't have stat points that I didn't put in. Do lip tricks. It's like holding triangle,
[2685.02s -> 2692.81s]  right? Right at the top. All right, Eric, let's fucking go.
[2696.89s -> 2755.08s]  Okay, come on. What? Whoa. He just fucking shot me into the air. Oh my God. I'm like
[2755.08s -> 2784.84s]  tilting right now. Did I win? Eric, don't you fucking dare. Eric, Eric, why are you so hard?
[2789.18s -> 2795.42s]  What the fuck, Eric? Eric, you're supposed to be in the tutorial. Eric, you haven't even taught me
[2795.42s -> 2808.90s]  how to do anything besides a melon grab. Why are you trying so hard? Imagine doing this on sick
[2808.90s -> 2831.16s]  difficulty. He probably does like 100,000 points. Fuck, I keep screwing that up. You can't just
[2831.16s -> 2848.54s]  mash. Shit. Oh my God. I'm not going to be able to beat Eric. I'm not going to be able to beat
[2848.54s -> 2881.85s]  Eric on the tutorial. I beat Eric. I can't believe I almost lost it. That was way harder than it
[2881.85s -> 2901.54s]  should have been. I can't believe it took that long to beat Eric. Did he get arrested?
[2902.26s -> 2923.66s]  Fuck. I was going to say you fucking try to do that line, Eric. Also, I have to keep in mind,
[2924.62s -> 2939.85s]  I'm at zero stats on everything. I think I'm supposed to know who this is. Mike V.
[2945.46s -> 2965.80s]  You're way nicer than fucking Eric was. You all right, kid? You seem to smash your face on the
[2965.80s -> 2972.98s]  fucking ground. All right. You know what? Can you use an Xbox one controller on 360?
[2975.35s -> 2988.84s]  Can you use an Xbox one controller on 360? God damn it. You can't. It's the Xbox controller.
[2991.40s -> 2994.04s]  They're all the same button. They're not individual buttons.
[2994.04s -> 3001.90s]  I probably should have thought about that. It's all just one axis. It's just one huge
[3001.90s -> 3006.46s]  button on their original Xbox 360 controller. You know, they're individual. God damn it.
[3007.26s -> 3018.54s]  See how these are individual buttons? See, like, you guys need to see. I can't use the analog
[3018.54s -> 3025.40s]  either. It's too hard. I'll have to. I'll get used to it. I never use the analog in any of these
[3025.40s -> 3043.06s]  games. How do I do Flamingo? Left, right, B. What? You're fucked for real. I've never used
[3043.06s -> 3050.04s]  an analog in a Tony Hawk game. I only use the defense. It's easier to press the buttons
[3050.76s -> 3066.57s]  because, like, hitting, like, left and it's... No, it's too hard. I'd rather just use the analog.
[3067.45s -> 3074.62s]  It's because of manuals. It's hard for me to do a manual than analog. I don't like it.
[3075.74s -> 3085.99s]  It's easier to go, like, tap up and down on the actual buttons than to have the analog.
[3088.63s -> 3093.51s]  That's why I learned how to play these games with the D-Pad long ago, just because manuals
[3093.51s -> 3097.91s]  is just so much easier. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Because you can go way
[3097.91s -> 3113.18s]  too far. See how I'm using the analog right now? Oh, too much. Remember, you're nuts. I saw one person
[3113.18s -> 3133.10s]  said, I agree, so I don't care. As long as one person agrees with me, what do I care? All right,
[3133.10s -> 3153.27s]  we need another... Oh, I got too greedy. Looking for... There is somebody.
[3153.99s -> 3160.15s]  Oh, I never even got the guy's skateboard back, did I? Hey, JT, not out racing today.
[3163.56s -> 3167.56s]  Hey, the kid next door. Nah, Charles needs some exercise.
[3169.32s -> 3173.00s]  I'll give you five bucks to run him around the block a couple of times for me.
[3176.94s -> 3180.38s]  Five bucks? Wait, what?
[3185.21s -> 3200.02s]  Do I have to ride the dog? This dog is fucking fast, man.
[3211.21s -> 3230.94s]  Oh, Muska's here. We got Muska's demo. Same counter. All right, so how is the voice acting
[3230.94s -> 3258.01s]  in this game, you think? Yo, check this out. Muska, chilling, chilling. Where? Australia.
[3258.65s -> 3261.45s]  That's how you hook it up. How do we get this close to Chad Muska?
[3272.92s -> 3277.64s]  Wow, Muska in Jersey? Unreal. I wonder if anyone could impress him.
[3280.28s -> 3286.73s]  He's checking out the pool by the skate shop. Eric, where is that?
[3286.73s -> 3299.50s]  Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad, are you looking? Chad, I just want to say I'm a really big fan.
[3301.18s -> 3309.19s]  What do you think about this? Chad, look at me, Chad.
[3316.82s -> 3320.34s]  Chad, just wait, I'm coming. Chad, take a look at this one.
[3321.22s -> 3339.69s]  Oh, hey, Chad. Hey, man. When we drive around, just avoid this fucking weird kid.
[3340.81s -> 3342.89s]  He's freaking me out. It looks like a good place to skate.
[3342.89s -> 3364.66s]  I didn't do it. All right. 30,000 points. Fuck. 40 year old kid. Come on. I can't.
[3365.38s -> 3374.39s]  Do you think we should call the police or something? Or is it going to be all right?
[3376.15s -> 3413.22s]  It doesn't look like the other kids. Chad, just watch. Okay, I know what I have to do.
[3413.22s -> 3430.60s]  Yo, it looks like a good place to skate. Oh, they turn this way. Fuck. 7,000. God damn it.
[3444.38s -> 3446.70s]  Yo, it looks like a good place to skate. What's this? I'm just going to finish the trick in
[3446.70s -> 3477.93s]  front of me. What? When did it finish? A place to skate. I'm so desperate for his attention.
[3478.49s -> 3488.36s]  Just give me attention, Chad. I'm dying over here. Just please look at me.
[3489.32s -> 3497.96s]  I'm going to go. I'm going to start all the way back here. I know he can't see me. It doesn't
[3497.96s -> 3513.66s]  matter. I'm going to finish the trick. Here we go. I made a good line. 6,000 points. Fuck.
[3521.72s -> 3546.68s]  Use the half pipe. 30k total. It's 30k total. Not 30k in one trick. You can bust some nice lines
[3546.76s -> 3568.60s]  there. Is it? Yes. Restart it. That looks like a good place to skate. Okay, fine. It does. Nice
[3568.60s -> 3613.80s]  turn. Okay, he saw it. Okay, good. He's not even looking. I just was in front of the car.
[3614.76s -> 3626.79s]  I was just standing in front of the car. Not bad. Not bad. That looks like a good place to skate.
[3627.43s -> 3648.26s]  Yes, it does, Chad. I'm losing my mind here. That was 10,000 points. That looks like a good
[3648.26s -> 3677.72s]  place to skate, man. Okay, I'm laughing. This is too funny. Whoa, Chad Muska. Holy shit.
[3680.04s -> 3681.32s]  I can't believe he noticed me.
[3686.68s -> 3691.32s]  I had no money, no place to stay, nothing, man, until my first shop sponsor hooked me up.
[3691.32s -> 3694.28s]  So why don't you head down to your shop, check out their riders. I thought there was a Christmas
[3694.28s -> 3700.36s]  present in his front seat. I was like, wow. And yo, Merry Christmas. It is. Thank you. Thanks.
[3705.80s -> 3709.48s]  Mr. Peralta's not here right now, but if you want to be sponsored by a skate shop,
[3709.48s -> 3714.44s]  you'll need to impress the riders on his team. If you get us to sign off on you, you're in.
[3714.44s -> 3728.12s]  Okay. All right. Bernie Ovine is doing pretty good. Chapter two, impressing the locals.
[3733.70s -> 3738.02s]  So you want to be sponsored, huh? Got to be able to put up big numbers under pressure.
[3738.02s -> 3747.35s]  Think you can handle it? Yeah, sure. No problem. Okay, then let's see what you can do using our
[3747.35s -> 3750.71s]  setup.
[3758.78s -> 3766.97s]  Why don't I have a private lane? Why don't I have a private lane? Why are you people standing here?
[3768.52s -> 3774.68s]  I'm taking out all the competition. Oh, okay. I need 20,000 points. Everyone's watching you.
[3774.76s -> 3777.00s]  Let me see. I saw the fucked up thing I just did.
[3783.64s -> 3796.70s]  All right. Did it. Jesus. Yep. I am a local. Dude, I go to school with your sister.
[3797.82s -> 3806.04s]  Then you should get stats increased. No, you'll probably need at least five tries to hit them
[3806.04s -> 3829.70s]  like I do. You Chris's best line. It took me six months to hit that line. Well, whatever.
[3830.50s -> 3835.05s]  I did it. See if you can hit this. Chris's crazy line.
[3844.31s -> 3869.75s]  It's a broken neck in two places. End it, end it, end it, end it. All right, let's go.
[3870.31s -> 3875.64s]  I got to impress all the locals. Why does it have a gas coming out of here?
[3876.36s -> 3900.12s]  I heard yo skater. Why am I a charging bull? How much do I weigh? Am I a train?
[3901.08s -> 3907.06s]  You goals. Impress Sean. Impress Joey. Impress Sean.
[3908.02s -> 3911.45s]  Let's see if you got the cojones. I can just go right to them.
[3912.17s -> 3916.65s]  Meet me on the roof. Use the quarter pipe to get up to roof height. Then hold left and jump off
[3916.65s -> 3921.93s]  your board onto the roof. That seems like a lot of it. Jump onto the roof and then get off your
[3921.93s -> 3931.88s]  board while jumping up onto the roof. Nicely done. Now I want you to transfer between the houses.
[3931.88s -> 3936.68s]  Don't live in these houses to transfer. Come down the ramp and angle yourself. So your jump
[3936.68s -> 3944.78s]  carries you across the space between the houses. Oh, and carefully you don't overshoot. I don't
[3944.78s -> 3949.50s]  want to have to scrape you off of Elm Street. Transfer over the alley. So he wants me to
[3955.37s -> 3971.61s]  feel pain. Hold on. I kind of don't understand what he wants me to do. Transfer over, get off
[3971.61s -> 3986.79s]  the board and then jump up and then get on. Oh, I know what he wants me to do. Nice. Now spine
[3986.79s -> 3993.21s]  back down and I'll tell Mr. Brompton you've got skills. So skate up the quarter pipe, catch air,
[3993.21s -> 3998.89s]  spine transfer and land in the quarter pipe below. Skate up the quarter pipe, catch air, spine
[3998.89s -> 4023.98s]  transfer and land in the quarter pipe. Spine transfer. That's not it. Where does it go?
[4029.43s -> 4038.09s]  Why is it spawning me here? I don't know. What is it? What spine? Okay, spine transfer is that.
[4039.93s -> 4048.07s]  Spine transfer is you just go forward. They're using these terms like I should know where they
[4048.07s -> 4052.98s]  are. Mongo, spine transfer, goofy. I don't know what these things are.
[4069.94s -> 4072.98s]  So just run in. I weigh like 6,000 pounds. Just run everybody over.
[4080.90s -> 4093.78s]  Where's the school? Like where's the school? What is going on in this neighborhood?
[4094.74s -> 4105.94s]  We have to like fight crack heads. Wait kid, it's too dangerous.
[4130.38s -> 4136.18s]  It's an actual stealth section. Wait kid, it's too dangerous.
[4137.30s -> 4196.14s]  Oh, get on the roof. What? I'm supposed to get by them around this way. Where is it?
[4213.34s -> 4222.71s]  Is that the Simpsons? Wait kid, it's too dangerous. I'm going to go back. No,
[4222.87s -> 4232.33s]  no. Use the wires? What do you mean the wires? What? You want me to tightrope walk on the wire?
[4232.33s -> 4245.22s]  I can't grab them. Power lines? Didn't I just grab them and fall? Just go straight on the roof.
[4255.05s -> 4277.48s]  Wait, why would I do this? This would kill somebody. You die if you do this. If I make
[4277.48s -> 4306.10s]  any connection with anything. I can get fucking hurt doing this. All lines can't kill you,
[4306.10s -> 4325.21s]  but electric lines can. If you touch any other thing, you die. Wait, Eric? Is Eric doing drugs?
[4325.69s -> 4330.65s]  Oh no, Eric is doing arson.
[4331.37s -> 4344.94s]  Oh, I'm looking for the owner, Mr. Peralta. Wait, are you the Stacy Peralta? That's me.
[4345.90s -> 4351.02s]  You the guy my skaters have been talking about? Well, I hope so. I'd like to be sponsored by your
[4351.02s -> 4357.74s]  shop. Yeah, so would everybody else. I'll tell you what. Make me a sponsor me video. Show me what
[4357.74s -> 4361.34s]  makes you different than Bobby B down the street. I can't wait to make a sponsor me video. Please
[4361.34s -> 4364.78s]  don't hand me anything from the same old spots in New Jersey, dude, because I've seen it all.
[4365.98s -> 4374.41s]  Done. No local spots and different tricks. Dude, I just gave me the go ahead and do something
[4374.41s -> 4381.30s]  dangerous. They know those gangsters know it was me. What are you talking about? When I got back
[4381.30s -> 4386.42s]  to my house last night, they were parked outside waiting for me. I've seen all the local tricks.
[4387.78s -> 4392.98s]  I haven't seen somebody put their tongue in through an outlet yet. It couldn't work for me.
[4392.98s -> 4412.84s]  Hey, Eric, are you okay? I think we lost him. Who's this guy?
[4415.13s -> 4418.89s]  We got to get out of here. If they find me, it'll be my name on this headstone.
[4418.89s -> 4425.06s]  I'm hiding here with Headstone Harry. Headstone Harry. But if we bring in some scrap metal,
[4425.06s -> 4429.30s]  he says he'll bang us out of our ramp. And if we can get it set up, the street warriors say they'll
[4429.30s -> 4435.94s]  give us a tow to get speed. Jumping the bridge is the only way to get past the cops. Quick,
[4436.10s -> 4441.74s]  drug dealers are after us. All right, I got to get the scrap metal. Press A and jump and grab.
[4441.74s -> 4453.05s]  All right, scrap metal, let's go. Or scrap, scrap, scrap. Let's probably get off the board.
[4456.20s -> 4481.16s]  Jump and grab. Where am I? Up here? On the roof? Do I need six? Filter. Big jump.
[4485.93s -> 4500.20s]  Didn't work, but it's all right. Need to get to the other side of the bridge, huh?
[4500.20s -> 4505.32s]  No problem. Those pigs can't stop us. Grab the back of my ride and I'll get you up to speed.
[4505.64s -> 4515.78s]  Clear the bridge. Okay, let's go. Don't let go until I tell you. Hit L and R if you want to
[4515.78s -> 4568.82s]  switch sides. I don't need to switch sides. Ready? Steady? All right, how do you let go?
[4569.38s -> 4584.63s]  Is it just up again? Is it down? All right, it's down. Holy shit.
[4584.63s -> 4602.02s]  No skater punks allowed in this station.
[4606.26s -> 4609.16s]  How would I land that? Do I have a parachute?
[4609.96s -> 4614.68s]  Please, man, we have to get out of town. The Elm Street dealers are after us. We're desperate.
[4614.68s -> 4620.74s]  Didn't you see us jump the bridge? Guess I was too busy stopping lions,
[4620.74s -> 4626.26s]  skate rats from sneaking into the station and spray painting, I am the king of no pants on
[4626.26s -> 4632.92s]  a phone key on. What's your problem, bacon bits? Wake up on the wrong side of your mother this
[4632.92s -> 4658.10s]  morning. Oh, holy shit. Makes Stu chase you three times around the circle. Did I kill him?
[4669.30s -> 4674.34s]  Okay, well, we killed the security guard. Yes. Keep going.
[4688.38s -> 4694.66s]  All right. Can't be on the street. Get 25,000 points. Don't touch the street.
[4710.02s -> 4722.38s]  End it. Oh, I thought I could end it. End it. Oh, it's ended. End the trick.
[4723.10s -> 4763.64s]  I can end it right there. There it is. No, it's not it. Shit. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Shit.
[4766.79s -> 4782.41s]  No, you idiot. I was trying to do a lit trick. Turn the music up. The music is as loud as it can go.
[4783.21s -> 4792.31s]  I think it's just bad mixing. Back to the hangout. Save. Wait, they took Eric. Hold on.
[4792.87s -> 4797.30s]  Yeah, look, I think I'm pretty sure it's off as loud as it can go. Maybe it's not.
[4800.10s -> 4800.74s]  I had it in reverse.
[4812.30s -> 4820.42s]  All right, we got to chase him. Hey, Eric, look out the back window.
[4821.22s -> 4855.50s]  Eric's dead. Can I go faster? Oh, come on. What the fuck is that even there for?
[4855.82s -> 4880.98s]  Who are these people?
[4890.25s -> 4905.50s]  There's a car in this game. Okay, well, that took me back a little. There's a car. Good.
[4910.42s -> 4929.85s]  It's a full letter grade. That much is certain. All right, Brian. Imagine you jumping for him.
[4929.85s -> 4936.31s]  That was a stupid thing. It was like a Disney game. Rescue Eric. Got it.
[4940.49s -> 4943.53s]  That's one way to rescue somebody. Let's get the hell out of here.
[4946.82s -> 4963.19s]  Quick, get on the train. That's Mario Kart. We can't grind in Mario Kart. We're in Manhattan.
[4964.15s -> 4975.83s]  Big bad New York. Peralta will be pumped if we can get some footage from the program.
[4975.83s -> 4982.63s]  Are we actually going to make a video? Veterans Memorial, the Pyramid Ledges, and 78 Water Street.
[4983.67s -> 4984.95s]  I hope I get to edit the video.
[4988.79s -> 4998.10s]  Where are your parents? Well, in the lore, I am the parent. This character is 40, so
[4999.30s -> 5011.30s]  you're looking at him. Skate the Big Apple. I'll find it.
[5030.78s -> 5036.06s]  Explode the Alpha and Omega Coles with drum rolls and hoes. So we uphold and foretold the scores
[5036.06s -> 5041.50s]  of six years ago. Fast flow from G-Rap to Kool Moe. Super Celeb-O. Major to the Minimo. Every
[5041.50s -> 5045.90s]  individual bounce to the tip of your lungs. Collapse and raps you trapped in. The only way
[5045.90s -> 5049.66s]  to make it happen, George, I've been fast. I'm the hot dog. The run the hottest monologue
[5049.66s -> 5057.82s]  installed. Poetic and certain. Can I actually get up there from? Oh, wait. Get on the board.
[5061.72s -> 5078.49s]  Oh, OK. I restarted. I got one.
[5084.97s -> 5090.57s]  Found one of five. Where's your other stuff? Oh, is that what? Up there? Shit.
[5096.65s -> 5097.93s]  Come on. Why'd you have to do that?
[5097.93s -> 5107.77s]  No, I got the one up there.
[5123.14s -> 5128.47s]  I don't see anything. Oh, there's one here.
[5129.43s -> 5132.07s]  I'm going to get the hair on that.
[5150.39s -> 5156.41s]  Where? Over there. Where? Where? Where? Right there.
[5160.57s -> 5177.69s]  I'm going to get one of there, too. OK, I should get it. Wrong way.
[5177.69s -> 5189.29s]  Last one's this way.
[5200.42s -> 5205.94s]  I got to get all the way up there. OK, I know two. I got to grind on that bar.
[5205.94s -> 5218.26s]  How many cars to come down this tiny little fucking road?
[5224.79s -> 5227.03s]  They're probably saying the same thing about me, too.
[5244.65s -> 5253.27s]  Oh, I had it. I just didn't grab it. No, I had it too. Shit. No, I'm dead.
[5259.18s -> 5282.87s]  No, here we go. Number two. Here we go. All right. I'm hitting. I'm letting go of the ollie
[5282.87s -> 5306.89s]  too. Way too late, apparently. I don't know why. Song name? Pause for the song name. Hold on.
[5320.74s -> 5339.16s]  Little Lips. Grab it, can I? Can I just jump and grab the damn thing? Do this. Can I get it?
[5339.48s -> 5376.26s]  Yeah. Song is Crush Them by GBH. Crush Them. Get off the board. This one's going to be so hard for
[5376.26s -> 5393.50s]  me to get because of the angle. Tiny little lips. No, I want to grind it. No, I want to stop doing it.
[5393.50s -> 5420.09s]  I want to grind the fucking rail. Thank you. There it is. Yes. All right, who's next?
[5420.09s -> 5442.66s]  You. No, you. What song is this? It's Braggin' Rites.
[5463.21s -> 5482.46s]  Uh, hold grind combos. Up and Y and then Y. Y and then down Y.
[5485.58s -> 5493.34s]  Can you make the game louder? A smidge. There we go. What about you? Yo, let's see you try
[5493.34s -> 5498.06s]  this one. Get special on this QP to do a Muwop 5-0. It's QP. I don't know what that term is.
[5502.65s -> 5510.18s]  Get a QP on this M5-0. Oh wait, that's Chad Muska. He's just hanging out over here.
[5510.18s -> 5515.69s]  All right. Get special on this quarter pipe then do a Moonwalk 5-0.
[5524.95s -> 5530.07s]  I'm gonna die. Get special and Moonwalk 5-0 the waterfront.
[5542.23s -> 5549.99s]  Down, left, right. I died.
[5559.18s -> 5559.98s]  Still don't have a special.
[5562.06s -> 5563.18s]  All right, there we go.
[5567.98s -> 5575.51s]  Shit. Is that not it? I don't have a special anymore. Damn it.
[5575.51s -> 5644.34s]  I didn't do it. Is this it? No, it's down, left, Y. Down, left, Y. All right, slow down a little.
[5644.90s -> 5669.02s]  Down, left. Okay, here we go. Down, left, Y.
[5669.74s -> 5681.06s]  Don't fall in. Oh no, that guy. That guy was doing the same quest.
[5695.43s -> 5706.66s]  Oh, it's all right. I'll get it. That poor guy was doing the same thing.
[5706.66s -> 5713.46s]  We're all trying to impress the same guy. I'm not going fast enough. Look at how bad this is.
[5725.42s -> 5727.74s]  Hey, be careful, man. Watch out for the bodies in there.
[5729.74s -> 5733.42s]  People keep trying to impress me and they keep getting fucking killed in there. You keep killing
[5733.42s -> 5755.40s]  each other. Radical. That's not a bad deal, but I don't really want to do that.
[5756.52s -> 5766.22s]  Why destroy the competing car mission? Why is this car so low? I feel like it's not even a car.
[5767.18s -> 5790.22s]  This is freaking me out. I feel like the car's inside the ground. I didn't mean it. Okay,
[5791.98s -> 5796.22s]  I'm not sure what we're going to be doing this time. I think we're going to have a good line
[5796.22s -> 5824.17s]  here because there's seven of these. That restarted. I got time. I got time.
[5825.53s -> 5831.69s]  Ah, that arrow fucked my head. It's hit and run all over again. It's like the same driving
[5831.69s -> 5860.65s]  mechanics in hit and run. Where's the last one? I'm getting time. That's good. Wait, where is he?
[5870.34s -> 5880.94s]  How do you even have to shop in an alley? That doesn't seem like the smartest place to get
[5880.94s -> 5885.48s]  business.
[5892.12s -> 5905.16s]  Okay, entertain us by throwing 45,000 anywhere or do I have to be in here? 45,000 doesn't matter.
[5914.57s -> 5915.45s]  I'm going to do this line here.
[5933.00s -> 5944.84s]  I just grew. It's got color. That's weird. All right, Bernie Bovine, doing good so far.
[5962.58s -> 5964.50s]  I can't wait to impress the fuck out of these guys.
[5964.50s -> 5971.22s]  Wait, take your soggy mob flips back to Jersey, tweakers. Hey, let's just go skate. If we tear
[5971.22s -> 5989.58s]  up your favorite spots- Excuse me, the proper term is crackhead. All right, I'm going to impress
[5989.58s -> 5995.88s]  the locals and then they finally will have to use their video camera. Alley switch coming up.
[6003.98s -> 6030.07s]  Trying to get up on the bridge. All right, what do you got for me? Some fun?
[6030.95s -> 6035.42s]  Can you help me out? I need to get some footage of this kid and my camera's busted.
[6035.42s -> 6039.10s]  He's risking his life on this line. Can you help me? I need to get some footage of this kid.
[6042.28s -> 6078.26s]  Film the locals. Stay close. That works, but isn't somebody filming me filming him?
[6084.65s -> 6092.52s]  All right, I got to get a big drop into a switch with a transfer. Come on.
[6093.98s -> 6097.82s]  Don't fall. Hold on. That's the best part of my 20-hundreds. I can do shit like this.
[6098.86s -> 6104.54s]  You know exactly what I was trying to do there? Just pretend I did it.
[6105.50s -> 6135.21s]  Oh, shit, dude. That was fucking awesome. All right, what do you got? Check out my buddy's
[6135.21s -> 6142.02s]  sick line here in the banks. This is a line? It's a bunch of cars. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[6142.02s -> 6146.58s]  wait. Hit the killer line combo. Wait, why didn't it start? We're getting ready.
[6149.46s -> 6168.86s]  Oh, okay. Hold on. Start it up. What? That was- It was still in the combo.
[6169.74s -> 6203.50s]  Fuck. I need more speed than this. Do I have to start on the car? I have to end on that.
[6244.12s -> 6259.48s]  I'm so mad. I can't fucking believe it. Dude, I'm telling you, this lift thing is
[6259.48s -> 6267.78s]  fucking me so hard. It's just ruining me. It's fucking me up. Fucking me up. So bad.
[6268.58s -> 6277.50s]  They're like, I'm timing it wrong. Help me out and help me get some killer footage for Stacy.
[6277.50s -> 6282.18s]  Remember how she was building this? Okay. The guards are tough, but I heard they like hot
[6282.18s -> 6289.77s]  steaming nuts. What? Get some nuts from the vendors and bring them back to the guards
[6289.77s -> 6295.21s]  before they get cold. Here comes the meltdown. No, I just- I gotta get that lift better
[6295.77s -> 6298.81s]  because I'm doing it too early or too late. It's like that little window.
[6299.93s -> 6304.50s]  All right, let's go. Getting nuts from- I get nuts for life. What? I don't understand.
[6305.46s -> 6320.73s]  Here. No, I have to keep getting them.
[6331.93s -> 6359.54s]  Hurry. Where's this guard? Guard up here? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[6372.33s -> 6393.29s]  There's a security guard this way. I have to put the angle up.
[6408.14s -> 6413.30s]  What's with this place and nuts? You guys have anything else to talk about here?
[6421.80s -> 6431.42s]  Yeah, we just fucking love nuts in New York. Get special and then nut bust inside the building.
[6433.61s -> 6457.48s]  Wait. Okay, I got a special. Nut bust. Can I even get back in? Oh, it's in the building?
[6458.36s -> 6484.10s]  Sure, you can make that trick even better. It's the rocket ship.
[6484.10s -> 6490.20s]  Create a trick. Welcome. In Tony Hawk Underground, you can create your own tricks.
[6491.08s -> 6494.12s]  The trick timeline shows the components of the trick you just landed.
[6494.92s -> 6505.91s]  Tweak it or make a whole new trick and map it to your skater. Let's go. Front flip spin.
[6505.91s -> 6547.35s]  Okay. All right. Point five seconds seems pretty good. Okay. And then right after that,
[6548.55s -> 6573.62s]  I want a new trick. Slow, you go into this slow motion, more rotation. So just do like 6,000
[6573.62s -> 6579.06s]  front flips in like three seconds. In two seconds. Yeah, hold on. Get rid of this.
[6579.94s -> 6619.22s]  Uh, rotation. Roll. The spin. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. No, no, no. I want it to be.
[6620.10s -> 6646.02s]  Okay. One more. Two or three more of these. This is just a Sonic the Hedgehog card.
[6646.66s -> 6663.74s]  Did you sound? Yeah.
[6682.58s -> 6684.34s]  No, I'm not doing the fart sound, guys.
[6725.02s -> 6733.26s]  Special. Okay. I can't even. What's happening in here?
[6736.23s -> 6741.11s]  This is what happens when you attach 10 thrusters to somebody in a Garry's Mod multiplayer game.
[6755.77s -> 6765.16s]  No, no, no, no, no. No, it's too much. Can't even see what's going on. No. How do I get back?
[6765.80s -> 6774.01s]  I don't delete it. I want another one of those super spins.
[6798.70s -> 6808.65s]  Well, what's happening at the end? Wait, hold on. What about this?
[6809.61s -> 6829.26s]  That's good. All right. That's good. Done. Is it saved? More sounds.
[6833.06s -> 6860.68s]  I can only have three sounds. You get what you want. Okay. Trick done. Name the trick.
[6861.64s -> 6885.75s]  Preview trick. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I've accidentally done this so many times. I can't
[6885.75s -> 6898.09s]  put it on X. It's got to be way quicker than that. How long is it? Two seconds?
[6902.52s -> 6929.82s]  Let me see if I can even do this. I don't think it's possible to land. It's got to be faster.
[6929.82s -> 6963.62s]  Holy shit, I just did it. Oh, no. This whole playthrough just got ruined. Rename it. Name
[6963.62s -> 6982.89s]  trick. Hyper flush. Hyper drain. Hyper flush. The drain. The drain.
[6989.70s -> 7001.67s]  Okay. This is on a kick flip. This replaced kick flip. The royal flush.
[7007.35s -> 7010.87s]  This whole playthrough just got destroyed because now I'm just going to make
[7010.87s -> 7015.27s]  fucked up tricks for every move and never going to be able to finish the game.
[7027.56s -> 7038.12s]  The royal flush. Save the trick. Royal flush. Okay.
[7042.31s -> 7080.31s]  It's got to be. Hold on. Back to editor. Okay. Let's try that. Use it.
[7080.31s -> 7100.38s]  Add a scream. There's no scream.
[7119.35s -> 7123.46s]  There is no scream, guys.
[7128.81s -> 7133.16s]  All right. We got it. Keep this. Create a trick. Once kept, a credit trick can be permanently
[7133.16s -> 7145.02s]  mapped to your skater from the tricks menu. Yes. Okay. Let's create a new trick.
[7163.85s -> 7166.01s]  Holdable.
[7166.01s -> 7174.25s]  Air walk. Oh, that's pretty sick.
[7178.23s -> 7184.23s]  Hold on. What else we got? All right. We're going to do air walk.
[7185.75s -> 7193.99s]  Air walk is going to be long. We're just going to stick our legs out. Make it fall three seconds.
[7193.99s -> 7203.24s]  Bang. Is it not holdable? No. So in the middle of this, boom. Right when the foot comes out,
[7205.80s -> 7214.79s]  you can do this. Flip trick. You don't have any room. What? Oh, can't do it for that long.
[7217.37s -> 7223.86s]  All right. Right when the foot comes out, boom. Boom. New part. Gotta be quicker than that.
[7224.82s -> 7230.86s]  Bang. Foot comes out into a
[7235.38s -> 7248.04s]  boom. Hold on. Wait. Check this out.
[7263.67s -> 7267.80s]  Hold on. Oh, I can't. I can't. I can't do it.
[7271.93s -> 7273.45s]  No, never mind. Not a flip trick.
[7278.73s -> 7281.45s]  Let's see. When there's a rotation, like spinning. Ooh, that's kind of cool.
[7282.49s -> 7287.22s]  That's also pretty cool. That's pretty cool too.
[7297.11s -> 7298.39s]  Ooh, that's tricky.
[7303.21s -> 7312.66s]  No, no. I don't like it. Something else. Other. Well, hand stand.
[7314.50s -> 7328.25s]  What is a Casper? Truck stand. The faction.
[7338.47s -> 7340.55s]  You just play the guitar.
[7365.05s -> 7388.38s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7388.38s -> 7396.30s]  Another one. Oh, I can only have three sounds. All right. Let's check it out.
[7396.30s -> 7404.65s]  What? Why is it playing?
[7409.94s -> 7415.69s]  It already has a sound effect built into it.
[7424.62s -> 7428.71s]  It already has a sound effect. Get this fucking thing out of here.
[7428.71s -> 7445.61s]  What is this? Hold the American flag. Slam bam. All right. This is a fall joke. I like this.
[7462.78s -> 7475.06s]  It's got to be a little backwards. You're going to have backwards that you bounce off. No,
[7475.06s -> 7482.46s]  you're going to bounce back. Okay. It's too long. Three seconds is a long time.
[7482.70s -> 7486.14s]  Anything more than two seconds is almost impossible without huge air.
[7487.18s -> 7498.14s]  Okay. One second should be all right. And then we'll go to other as well. What else we got?
[7502.86s -> 7516.18s]  Handstand. Handstand and then falling off the board. Do it again, but backwards. Let's cheer.
[7517.70s -> 7522.98s]  Anything ending in the fall. This is going to fuck me up because I'm going to think I fell off
[7523.94s -> 7554.49s]  the board. Slap. It's like I'm getting hit with projectiles. All right. Yeah. This is the people
[7554.49s -> 7594.52s]  are throwing objects at me trick. You got it. How does it look? I like it. That's good. A little
[7594.52s -> 7607.11s]  bit shorter. Yeah. That's a wall. I've lost control. Yep. Right there. Yeah. Okay. So somebody
[7607.11s -> 7610.95s]  throws a rock at me. Hits me right in the chest. Bang. I'm losing control. Falling off the board.
[7613.61s -> 7616.33s]  Yeah. I have to add like a, I have to add the moan because it's like,
[7618.97s -> 7626.62s]  let me edit this. Hold on.
[7634.89s -> 7655.42s]  I actually kind of like it a little longer. It's got to, it's got to flow animation wise
[7656.38s -> 7675.03s]  a little bit longer. What does it actually end if you do it back here?
[7675.99s -> 7678.28s]  Yeah. It's going to be the full fall.
[7682.18s -> 7687.91s]  Yeah. Cause then you get back up a little bit further out of the start,
[7689.19s -> 7698.01s]  a little bit further, I think. Let's see. Maybe further. No, I actually like it.
[7698.01s -> 7711.58s]  Like taking out his legs. Actually. Yeah. That's much better. Okay. Let's take a look at the slap.
[7712.30s -> 7721.86s]  What the fuck am I doing this like this? All right. That's fine.
[7727.62s -> 7731.54s]  We could pull. I like, I like how it rips his arm kind of back a little. There we go.
[7734.94s -> 7742.87s]  Okay. Now we have to add, oh, okay. So that's bang right there.
[7743.91s -> 7747.67s]  And then there has to, is it like a crashing sound?
[7769.27s -> 7774.18s]  Yeah. Okay. That actually, I don't think I want that there.
[7774.18s -> 7778.10s]  Do a fart at the land. You guys are killing me with the fart shit.
[7795.32s -> 7797.48s]  Let's test it.
[7807.06s -> 7808.66s]  I don't think it's going to work out.
[7814.34s -> 7818.82s]  Oh, my knee. What?
[7822.92s -> 7825.48s]  No, that's too, I, this has to be way shorter than that.
[7840.68s -> 7842.76s]  No, no way. It's going to be way shorter.
[7844.06s -> 7849.26s]  Hey. Oh, it's cause it's too full seconds. That's way too long.
[7874.50s -> 7875.70s]  Now that's one and a half seconds.
[7884.12s -> 7887.02s]  Okay. That's right.
[7890.06s -> 7893.02s]  Okay.
[7910.25s -> 7912.73s]  Why is the sound not playing?
[7924.18s -> 7928.90s]  Just got him shorter. It's still too long. I think I have to remove the slap.
[7938.26s -> 7941.45s]  Make it a grind. Can I do that?
[7945.38s -> 7950.18s]  Rotation grab flip special. How do I do that? How do I, I can't make it a grind.
[7951.46s -> 7956.66s]  No, I can't. Oh, well. All right. Let's try that.
[7959.70s -> 7982.65s]  Can I please get rid of the fart sound? Can I get rid of the fart? This is turning into
[7982.65s -> 8011.98s]  another crack game. Okay. Let's go.
[8012.22s -> 8023.42s]  I'm ready. Edit tricks, edit tricks, grab tricks. So right and B is indie, sniffy right now.
[8024.22s -> 8039.27s]  We're going to make it a royal flush. Is it a grab trick? Is the, wait, is the royal flush
[8039.27s -> 8052.57s]  a grab trick or is it a kickflip? Wait, I need, I need to get rid of the, I need to get rid of
[8052.65s -> 8061.51s]  Oh, I need to be, it has to be special. It doesn't matter. All right. Well then I'll,
[8062.47s -> 8072.34s]  I don't want it to be, I want indie. All right. What we got down at down, down B is going to be
[8073.38s -> 8080.70s]  the one, the royal flush. And then the other one's a kickflip. So it's a flip trick.
[8081.26s -> 8090.07s]  We'll just make that be left, left or whoops. Okay.
[8094.42s -> 8096.42s]  So now, are we just back out?
[8100.42s -> 8102.42s]  Let's see if I got it right.
[8105.46s -> 8107.46s]  I'm never going to be able to do that again.
[8110.90s -> 8114.90s]  No way. In any in-game scenario.
[8123.54s -> 8128.90s]  Music's so loud.
[8143.37s -> 8144.57s]  All right. I'm ready to get back into the game.
[8153.22s -> 8178.15s]  Working as intended. Let's view goals. What we got. Gap the burning taxi.
[8179.03s -> 8188.42s]  I did it. So, wait, did I not do it? Check out that taxi. The fire's starting to rage.
[8202.23s -> 8229.05s]  You got it. Don't show them that one. It's kind of hard to do this. Turn the fucking music up.
[8238.09s -> 8263.16s]  Louder, louder, louder. Hold on. Hold on. Just wait. No, the music is fine. Everyone,
[8263.16s -> 8272.25s]  look at all these people saying no. I can't do this nose grab. I'm doing up and B's.
[8272.97s -> 8286.86s]  Why is it not? Well, this one's a, this is a goal. Restart it. Dude, one guy, one guy, one guy,
[8286.86s -> 8308.01s]  one guy. Dude, come on, dude. One guy, one guy. This song is so good. One guy. This song is so bad.
[8308.01s -> 8322.41s]  One guy. I think this song is just right. One guy. I can't, all right, I cannot make it across.
[8322.41s -> 8326.41s]  I have to just go across and do the big one. It's too hard to jump it and do anything else.
[8327.05s -> 8334.97s]  It's bad. There you go. I can't even do it. It's not possible. I don't have enough jump right now.
[8335.69s -> 8355.40s]  I think this song is a cactus. One guy. But it's a pop puppet. Yeah.
[8360.68s -> 8374.23s]  What do you think you're doing? Hey, man. I got the video you sent me. Wow. You got style. You
[8374.23s -> 8379.27s]  are on the team. You're definitely on the team. I'm going to find a way to get you down to the
[8379.27s -> 8385.19s]  Tampa Am Contest. Tampa? What? That would be insane. But I have like three bucks to my name.
[8385.19s -> 8389.11s]  Why do I have yellow gloves on? Don't matter, man. I'll tell you what. You run some errands
[8389.11s -> 8393.19s]  for me in New York and I'll floor you my vintage bus for the trip. Now tell me what you want to
[8393.19s -> 8398.14s]  ride and I'll send you all the free gear you need for the event, dude. I got a new outfit.
[8399.43s -> 8403.27s]  Free gear from Peralta is now available in Skate Shop. You can now return to the Skate Shop from
[8403.27s -> 8417.77s]  the Edit Skater menu. Dex. Oh, hold on. Almost. All right. So I do the Almond Joy.
[8419.19s -> 8433.62s]  Baker. I think I like Almond Joy. Sorry. Yeah, I like the Almond Joy one. Grip tape.
[8434.82s -> 8440.55s]  Grip tape. Solid. This just looks like something fucked up. I like it.
[8442.07s -> 8455.29s]  Oh, like the molten lava one. Yep. Grip tape color. Green. Grip tape froze. No, I'm a pro.
[8456.09s -> 8462.36s]  Oh, it has to be black, right? All right, that's fine. That looks good. Wheel color.
[8465.02s -> 8486.74s]  That like bright blue. I just did poker table green. No, I didn't. Whatever. Astro turf green.
[8487.70s -> 8506.23s]  Bovine Ernie. That's a boomer board. Whatever. Favorites for a ride. Hello, you.
[8514.23s -> 8517.35s]  I am not going to turn it up. It's in a perfect spot.
[8528.31s -> 8544.46s]  And restaurant. Okay, no comply. Five times. How do I even pop that up? Good. You'll learn
[8544.46s -> 8562.15s]  over an obstacle. Apply this technique versus new will be delicious. No comply. Manual and then
[8562.15s -> 8569.67s]  manual and then trick out manual. No comply onto the no comply into a manual on the bench
[8569.67s -> 8582.55s]  and flick your gut. Soon we will fuse the boneless into modern music but first you must practice.
[8584.07s -> 8591.46s]  Remember, the boneless will give you extra height and distance. Boneless.
[8601.21s -> 8605.29s]  This one would be almost impossible to jump over. You can jump over with a boneless.
[8605.29s -> 8614.89s]  It's a simple task. This will be the ultimate fusion of new and old. Get some speed and
[8614.89s -> 8620.25s]  boneless off the lip of this quarter pipe. This should give you enough air to do a huge
[8620.25s -> 8627.46s]  vertric. Accomplishing this will bring boneless pizza. Boneless off the cube.
[8650.12s -> 8658.38s]  Boneless into a grind. Another grind. Manual and then off that into a royal flush.
[8658.70s -> 8676.38s]  People that are just showing up for the first time that haven't been watching the stream
[8676.38s -> 8679.18s]  are randomly going to see that trick and it's they're going to be blinking their eyes going
[8679.18s -> 8688.68s]  what how how is that in the game? Man, damn kids, I was supposed to have some new decks
[8688.68s -> 8693.96s]  delivered to the sponsors by the start of the show. I just did. You can get them back in time
[8693.96s -> 8718.33s]  it'd really save our ass. Okay, find the punks who stole the decks. It's not gonna work.
[8718.33s -> 8743.24s]  Where are the punks? Oh, I found a punk. Wink. Steal a deck and get away with it.
[8755.90s -> 8777.93s]  Where'd he go? Oh, two punks. I just went through the hoop for any three more punks.
[8779.13s -> 8808.38s]  What is that guy over here? I saw his indicator. Oh, you're out. Oh, you. Okay. I just accidentally
[8808.38s -> 8817.83s]  got one. He says we can borrow his old hippie bus and hit the road. He's accumulating wink debt.
[8830.71s -> 8848.02s]  Going to Tampa. Check. We apparently didn't make it to Tampa, I guess. I'm assuming.
[8848.90s -> 8855.74s]  One bad bumper sticker. Oh, big mistake, you punks. Oh, that was horrible.
[8860.65s -> 8865.37s]  Aren't you white meat supposed to be out fighting real crime? Like figuring out where that missing
[8865.37s -> 8872.49s]  sprinkled donut went. Oh, that's real funny, smart ass. Kiss your little roller skating contest.
[8872.49s -> 8876.25s]  Goodbye. That is unless your buddy here wants to do us some favors.
[8876.97s -> 8889.59s]  I got the two backpacks on his knees. All right, chapter seven with syrup or jelly.
[8890.63s -> 8900.12s]  Just, oh, Tampa's cool. Wait, what's this? We just got a very rare T-pose, by the way.
[8902.84s -> 8906.84s]  Hey, get special. They do a yeah right manual through the cones down the Pro Bowl.
[8907.72s -> 8910.36s]  Special and do a yeah right manual through the cones.
[8911.16s -> 8929.32s]  Uh, that's get special. Okay, let's go. Get special. I'm doing yeah, right through the cone.
[8933.43s -> 8944.26s]  What? Now that you got that down, get special, then skip this car. You suck.
[8945.54s -> 8950.34s]  Then do a yeah, right through the cone. Oh yeah, you only get one chance. I don't choke it.
[8950.34s -> 8966.87s]  One chance. Get special. Don't mess it up, you goof. Okay, now get special and then
[8968.07s -> 8993.83s]  it's the car and then yeah, right through the cones. Wait, will I just get special by doing this?
[8998.92s -> 9026.63s]  Yeah, right. It's next turn. Yeah, just rush. That's it. That's how I think that's my,
[9026.63s -> 9033.54s]  you might not be getting up from that one. Oh, that hurts. You're dead. That kills you.
[9033.54s -> 9039.10s]  That actually, I think that actually kills you. All this individual stickers everywhere.
[9043.18s -> 9053.37s]  Jump into the wall at an angle, then jump while wall riding to Wally and access hard
[9053.37s -> 9059.21s]  to reach high spots. Jump while we're on. Okay, wall ride, jump while wall riding.
[9060.49s -> 9070.50s]  Get all the stickers. Cool. There's one, here comes two. Gonna get a better line here.
[9071.22s -> 9094.52s]  Okay, I see another sticker. More back here. What's that? Wait, what the fuck was
[9094.52s -> 9112.12s]  I just looking at? I don't know. It was weird. Need more stickers. Sticker, sticker. There's two
[9112.12s -> 9126.30s]  more. Is that a sticker? No. This one. One more. What's that up there? Look at that.
[9128.73s -> 9177.58s]  Come on. Where's the final sticker? No. Where's the last sticker? Shit. I don't think I'm gonna
[9177.58s -> 9200.55s]  find it. Right over here. Rats. Anyone just come to the stream? Like, anybody just like,
[9200.55s -> 9208.55s]  just kind of show up right now? Welcome to the stream. Anyone that just showed up for Tony Hawk?
[9209.59s -> 9226.14s]  Pretty fun game. It's a pretty good game. All right, let's see. What else can we do here?
[9227.48s -> 9230.60s]  Remove all the stickers. Get the best donuts. We'll do this one.
[9231.48s -> 9236.20s]  Why don't you put yourself to some use? Go get some donuts for me and my fellow officers.
[9237.08s -> 9261.14s]  Twelve donuts. Okay, let's go like this. Grab here, up there. Not enough momentum. Two, three.
[9262.34s -> 9284.55s]  Okay, there's another one right here. Oh, there's a big line. Oh, that hurt. I'm trying to go over
[9284.55s -> 9318.49s]  it. Just grab it. Okay. Oh, look at this. Well, I didn't press the button fast enough.
[9328.97s -> 9336.78s]  All right, what do you got? A mission for me? Oh, the stickers. Okay, let's get it.
[9343.08s -> 9353.74s]  There's one up there. One behind the new girl's place. One on the wall back here.
[9354.70s -> 9401.05s]  One over here. And this one. Back here, right? No. Oh, I think it's the one I didn't get last time.
[9401.05s -> 9423.32s]  Did I get this one last time? I don't think so. I think I did. One right here. Okay, there's one more.
[9424.12s -> 9475.86s]  It has to be down here. That's it. Those aren't stickers. I have no idea where it is. This way.
[9478.66s -> 9485.74s]  Oh, I'm missing this one every time.
[9491.93s -> 9508.63s]  Okay, Lapid doesn't know. No, I don't. Every Tony Hawk game, I was always so awful with the
[9508.63s -> 9550.17s]  collect-the-thing. I just skipped every single one of them. Is there one down here? Fuck,
[9550.17s -> 9555.91s]  it's right there. Okay, right there. I didn't get that one. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[9555.91s -> 9566.06s]  no, no. Let's go. Come on, I need to get to the last two. All right, where's the script club place?
[9567.91s -> 9583.14s]  He didn't know. He doesn't know. He doesn't know. Don't tell him. Nobody tell him.
[9584.26s -> 9595.90s]  Hey, anybody just showing up for the first time? What else we got? Skateboarding bandit
[9595.90s -> 9602.28s]  and help the private eyes. Let's do skateboarding bandit. Someone has just robbed the bank and is
[9602.28s -> 9607.00s]  escaping up there through the skyway. If you follow the drop cache, it should lead you right to him.
[9607.00s -> 9633.29s]  Okay. Oh, damn. Let's do it again. Oh, I did a cool move there. Nailed. Am I not going? Oh,
[9633.29s -> 9698.41s]  I only have five seconds. Okay, right. Jesus. Holy shit. This is fast. Did I get it? Okay,
[9698.41s -> 9704.04s]  so if I jump off this, I go off to the left. I don't know why that happens. The way my thumb
[9704.04s -> 9709.24s]  is pressing on, you know what I'm saying? The way my thumb's pressing, it just always pushes me to
[9709.24s -> 9731.64s]  the top left. That's not helping either. Damn it. See what I'm talking about? Like I just like top
[9731.64s -> 9736.89s]  left because just the way that my hand naturally presses up, it just goes up to the top left.
[9737.45s -> 9749.34s]  How did I fail that?
[9778.17s -> 9781.45s]  Is he high right now? No, I just... It's hard to do that.
[9791.58s -> 9828.44s]  Jed. No! There's Jed! No! There's the other Jed sign. Jed. Jed? Jed? That's screen tearing though.
[9829.40s -> 9836.65s]  Jed. There's the Jed. Oh, I gotta... Come on.
[9853.19s -> 9859.98s]  Ditch the car. Why is there a lose the cops thing? Okay.
[9860.94s -> 9875.99s]  I want to rock and roll. All right. Wait, is this like... This is not the actual song.
[9878.31s -> 9896.92s]  It's a live version. How is driving in a circle around the same block losing the cops?
[9898.28s -> 9920.49s]  Not what happened. This is not... Why would the third guy go over? The third guy...
[9922.09s -> 9928.71s]  You just watched two of us drive into the water and you're going to do it too or whatever.
[9931.96s -> 9933.56s]  Nice driving. Now let's get out of here.
[9939.32s -> 9951.00s]  Save it. Tampa AM 2004 check in.
[9960.82s -> 9964.90s]  AKA now you're under arrest for fucking assaulting somebody. You just don't... No,
[9964.90s -> 9967.22s]  you just slapped somebody. You don't... You slapped him in the fucking face.
[9971.46s -> 9975.46s]  Dude, look, I'll sign up now. I told you the list is full.
[9975.46s -> 9981.46s]  Feel free to watch from the bleachers though. Yo Thomasville, what's up street dog? You been
[9981.46s -> 9990.94s]  shrouded in any 10 story rails with the old magic stunt wood? Yeah, I'm sorry about this. But
[9990.94s -> 9995.90s]  anyway, I gotta go skate. I mean, this could be my big break and who knows? Maybe you could
[9995.90s -> 10001.10s]  impress a pro or something to get into. This is going to be a double cross. Yeah.
[10010.86s -> 10015.26s]  He's going to be mean to me and shit and he's going to be like, you were always a loser.
[10015.26s -> 10018.30s]  You were always nothing and I'm going to have to beat him in the final.
[10019.99s -> 10024.47s]  You skate pretty well kid. There's a couple of things I want to see you do before you're ready
[10024.47s -> 10037.61s]  for the Tampa AM. First, land a trick with a spin. I'm going to be okay with this because I spin
[10037.61s -> 10072.74s]  every time I do anything. Land a trick with at least a 540 and a revert. That's cool. I need
[10072.82s -> 10090.17s]  any more pros. I like this place. Tampa's cool. Can't get in. So is there a reason why?
[10093.24s -> 10097.00s]  I guess maybe there is a reason why, but I just don't like to admit it or something.
[10098.71s -> 10101.91s]  Why has there never been another skating game like this?
[10102.79s -> 10106.34s]  Just kind of fall out of popular culture and people just didn't really care anymore or something.
[10114.17s -> 10125.94s]  All right, let's get out of here. Pretty much. Didn't Tony Hawk make a new game
[10125.94s -> 10128.98s]  this year or last year? It was like an iPad game or something.
[10130.10s -> 10153.03s]  Was it any good? Really bad. It was very bad. Let's see what we got here. Party boat skate tricks.
[10153.03s -> 10157.91s]  Welcome to Wet Beaver's party boat. Bam. This party is boring as hell.
[10157.91s -> 10161.27s]  Let's liven it up with some skating. Nail the tricks I yell out.
[10162.23s -> 10173.35s]  He'll flip. Of course, the same person is getting hurt every time.
[10175.14s -> 10178.10s]  You're leaning too far in, man. I'm hitting you in the face every time I go up.
[10179.06s -> 10227.91s]  It's like giving me anxiety. I'm the same guy. Don't stand in the way. Oh, boy. I'm telling you.
[10227.91s -> 10231.91s]  It's me hitting the people is what's freaking me out. I have to turn the volume off.
[10231.91s -> 10273.11s]  Oh, he used to cheat code. Reminding me of my past meltdowns.
[10273.11s -> 10277.27s]  All right, let's go skate some spots around Tampa. Let's see if you can beat my combos
[10277.27s -> 10297.62s]  while you're at it. Maybe. Beat Andrew's three best combos. What is that? That's pretty wild.
[10300.15s -> 10314.33s]  What combo, Andrew? Andrew, I just destroyed your combo.
[10314.33s -> 10335.74s]  Again, let's do it again, Andrew. Well, I got to do it in a row. I just didn't realize where I was.
[10336.78s -> 10369.00s]  No, stop. OK, next one. Now, this is the one on the roof. Jump over it and land.
[10369.00s -> 10393.85s]  It's going to go like this. Oh, fuck. No, fell off. Shit. All right. Fancy. What?
[10394.49s -> 10421.24s]  This is like a ball jump. It's a molding stream in the making. No, this is the nature of Tony Hawkman.
[10422.04s -> 10455.30s]  All right, let's get this one. Motherfucker. Streamer, look inside yourself. Wall plant combo.
[10455.30s -> 10459.54s]  I bet you can't wall plant off the drawbridge to wall. Here's where I learned how to do it straight
[10459.54s -> 10467.69s]  into a wall and hit this jump straight into a wall and hit this then manual all the way down
[10467.69s -> 10487.16s]  through the cones in one combo. Hurry up. There's some balance here. Oh, I got points.
[10489.40s -> 10493.56s]  Let's see if you can impress him by nailing the tricks I yell out. And for variety,
[10493.56s -> 10498.28s]  I'm going to throw in Tony Hawk. I wonder what he's going to say. Hey, man, nice work over there on
[10498.28s -> 10502.20s]  those grinds. You did such a good job. I'm going to make sure I give the word and that you can do
[10502.20s -> 10504.28s]  that. And then you can do the competition in Tampa.
[10516.81s -> 10529.78s]  Flip. 540 flip. He'll flip. He'll flip. I'm not doing it. He'll flip. He'll flip. What? He'll flip.
[10529.78s -> 10567.38s]  He'll flip. He'll flip. He'll flip. Oh, a 540. Whoops. I didn't even try to do it. I didn't even
[10567.38s -> 10585.42s]  try. No, I need to do an Indy. Why am I doing an air walk? Hey, you skate pretty well. Let's see
[10585.42s -> 10592.15s]  if you can hang with me. It's because of the Xbox buttons, the left and right. Here he is. Let's
[10592.15s -> 10614.60s]  see if you can hang with me. Beat Tony's score. I can't win this. That's the legendary Tony Hawk.
[10635.56s -> 10640.20s]  Whoa. What do you call those moves, man? Oh, I'm just destroying him.
[10644.49s -> 10651.02s]  Carrillo. Oh, this game is so fucking fun.
[10664.86s -> 10668.38s]  All right. I beat the shit out of him. He just doesn't even stand a chance.
[10679.13s -> 10680.57s]  Eric did better than Tony Hawk.
[10690.60s -> 10694.28s]  For the Tampa and talk about a surprise attack. If you stay on your board tomorrow,
[10694.28s -> 10699.16s]  you'll walk away with the contest. I can't. It's full. I worked so hard to get a sponsorship
[10699.16s -> 10704.68s]  from Stacy Peralta. Stacy Peralta? I know that dude. He was my first sponsor too, back in the 80s.
[10705.32s -> 10711.16s]  Is he still into yoga? That's one weird dude. But cool as they come. Look, I can't make any
[10711.16s -> 10716.20s]  guarantees, but I'll talk to the guys at the contest. Just show up tomorrow. This was way
[10716.20s -> 10720.28s]  better than I thought it was going to be acting wise. It was very good. That was actually just,
[10720.28s -> 10726.47s]  that was very natural. Tony Hawk, like actually naturally good actor. Well, pretty good.
[10727.43s -> 10731.91s]  By the way, if Tony Hawk can't get you into a skating competition, then no one can.
[10732.47s -> 10736.23s]  I don't think the president can like executive order get you in if Tony Hawk can't.
[10737.19s -> 10752.94s]  That was good. Got a tight street comp going on. Best two out of three runs. Stay inside on the
[10752.94s -> 10764.36s]  street course. Tight street comp going on. Best two out of three. Let's go. Oops.
[10804.12s -> 10821.59s]  91 to 88. All right. 90. Best step two out of three. That one, sorry.
[10838.87s -> 10851.74s]  43,000. What is that? 95? Yeah. All right. 90. 93. Rob. I don't like that place no more.
[10866.54s -> 10872.74s]  Now what? Talk to Afro Gym. There's some cool stuff on this here roof to trick on.
[10872.74s -> 10877.14s]  Climb up there and I'll meet you. You just have to jump up, grab on, and pull yourself up.
[10878.26s -> 10905.90s]  All the way up to the ladder. Hey, I just showed up. What is with the bar tricks?
[10907.90s -> 10921.38s]  I'm so glad. I'm so happy. That makes me so happy. Okay. Try and beat my high score. Stay on the
[10921.38s -> 10967.50s]  rooftops. Oh, that's not a roof? How's that not a rooftop? Okay. Take it easy. Too easy to get too
[10967.50s -> 10983.72s]  much momentum and fly off. I have two minutes. I know everyone's going to call me a cheeseball
[10983.72s -> 11010.09s]  for doing this, but that's fine. Oh, that's a broken arm.
[11018.54s -> 11022.54s]  9,000. All right. All right. I need like, I just need to kick flip in front like one or twice.
[11032.74s -> 11034.02s]  You fucking cheeseball.
[11034.02s -> 11038.66s]  With the lowest score gets eliminated. You're in a big combo. Don't worry. Those points count
[11038.66s -> 11043.46s]  toward your score as long as you don't fail. Last two skaters advance. Every 30 seconds,
[11043.46s -> 11062.78s]  the skater with the lowest score gets eliminated. Sorry, guys. You're dealing with a fucking pro.
[11063.74s -> 11083.40s]  Dude, I have 31. Wait, I have 31,000 points. How am I out of the competition?
[11084.12s -> 11093.88s]  What? I'm not. I mean, what? How am I not in first place?
[11093.88s -> 11124.55s]  Guys, best trick competition. I'm so confused. Well, I have 48,000 points,
[11124.55s -> 11132.02s]  but I'm not even on the list. Best trick pop to advance. All right. Well, aren't we all just in
[11132.02s -> 11145.22s]  here every 30 seconds to eliminate somebody. So why am I not on the list?
[11155.77s -> 11164.01s]  Why am I, why do I have a small brain? You see your own score. Yeah, but I mean, why wouldn't
[11164.01s -> 11180.33s]  it be on the, it told me like, oh, you're out of the competition area. I'm like, oh, I didn't know.
[11181.13s -> 11197.21s]  I'm sorry. So I have 44,000 points. I'm in first place. Okay. So I can't really lose
[11206.54s -> 11238.78s]  sloppily doubling everybody's point. 30 seconds. All right. All right. Let's go.
[11238.78s -> 11276.10s]  Get into some good here. Good line. Fuck. Sorry. Just me and Eric. Biggest score.
[11303.74s -> 11323.58s]  Trying to do the special. Choke, choke, choke.
[11346.04s -> 11351.46s]  Revert and manual. I do, I do manuals as much as I can, but like the revert into the manual,
[11351.46s -> 11355.14s]  you'd like revert manual. It's a brain kind of fucking freezes up.
[11367.74s -> 11373.02s]  Five seconds and let me talk to the damn kid. I gotta give it to you. That run was bullshit.
[11373.58s -> 11376.86s]  No, in a good way though. I'm gonna have to put you on element bottom line.
[11377.26s -> 11384.87s]  Oh, I'm on element. All the major deck companies are after you. Time to check out some videos to
[11384.87s -> 11397.02s]  see which sponsor best fits your style. The choice is yours. Birdhouse, Sean White,
[11397.02s -> 11411.93s]  and then the Olympian. What is a snowboarder? Holy shit. He's skated. Wow. Vinny Vegas.
[11439.02s -> 11461.24s]  Bam Margera. Bam Margera. Here's the thing about Bam Margera. The reason why half of
[11461.24s -> 11492.71s]  us think anything is funny is because of Bam Margera. Bam invented comedy, but that,
[11492.71s -> 11501.03s]  that like style of like alternative comedy, like Jackass. They're like Johnny Knoxville.
[11501.03s -> 11519.72s]  Those guys were just, they were nuts. That was pretty, that was horribly morbid. Holy shit.
[11521.99s -> 11537.34s]  I don't think I want to join the life sucks gang. There's no skateboard there.
[11546.60s -> 11551.61s]  All right. I like this. All right. Okay. I kind of liked that one because that was just like,
[11551.61s -> 11582.44s]  that was pretty funny. I kind of like, yeah, right. Pretty good. This game is what made me
[11582.44s -> 11590.92s]  want to be a graphics artist. I think like the thing about skateboarding, skateboarding in like
[11590.92s -> 11597.08s]  the mid nineties into the early two thousands influenced so many random other cultures that
[11597.08s -> 11605.80s]  have like counter cultures that moved in a million different places. It's spread out everywhere.
[11610.12s -> 11619.50s]  Fashion, graphic design, videos, making funny videos, videos, skateboarding groups would make
[11620.06s -> 11625.85s]  skits and shit. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about like Bam Margera and those guys
[11625.85s -> 11629.85s]  are some of the reasons why we have to have the shit that we think is funny. It's funny because
[11629.85s -> 11637.64s]  they like did the skits. It influenced so many things that you can't even wrap your brain around.
[11641.13s -> 11647.13s]  All right. For a second, I thought this had John Birdhouse, John Element, John Flip, John Girl,
[11647.13s -> 11657.37s]  John Zero. This is going to be tough. All right. I like the fun editing in Girl. We just had a
[11657.37s -> 11663.53s]  bunch of subs coming in though. No, we didn't. It was a ton of money. King of Troll gets 10,000
[11663.53s -> 11667.93s]  bits, a hundred bucks. Put this forward something nice to him. I will. Thanks to the huge,
[11667.93s -> 11680.26s]  ridiculous amount of money. I like the, as King of Troll, 10. Thank you. It's either going to be
[11680.26s -> 11690.73s]  Girl or, that's going to be Girl. Welcome to Girl. Gear up and then you'll be flowing out to San
[11690.73s -> 11718.14s]  Diego to meet the rest of your team. All right. Let's gear up. I like my Almond Joy. It's a real
[11718.14s -> 11727.91s]  color. I like Almond Joy. No, I can't. It's my board. I can't get rid of it. That's your sponsor.
[11734.98s -> 11741.83s]  Hey, what's up? You get in from the airport? Okay. Yeah. Are you Todd? Hey, I want to sponsor,
[11741.83s -> 11745.35s]  but I'm not going to put any of your stuff on. I got to finish this meal before I go out to eat.
[11745.35s -> 11749.67s]  So here's my skateboarding 101 spiel. The more coverage you get, the more crazy tricks you land,
[11749.67s -> 11753.99s]  the more tours and free gear for you. Okay. Just push yourself, show us your Skittles and everything
[11753.99s -> 11761.51s]  is cool. Skittles. Skills. Skittles mean skills. What are you from Idaho? Hey, look, the film is
[11761.51s -> 11765.03s]  here to shoot some other guys. Go piggyback with them and get some coverage. All right. Look at
[11765.03s -> 11779.45s]  those bit maps, spaghetti, french fries. It looks so good. All right. Prove yourself worthy.
[11785.10s -> 11798.52s]  All right. Your HUD changes too. That's cool. Rare T-pose study. We got. What do we got to do
[11798.52s -> 11804.76s]  for coverage these days? There's one that nobody will volunteer for. There's a bunch of flower boxes
[11804.76s -> 11809.40s]  up on that sketchy ledge and they want a picture of one of us grinding some of them down. Okay.
[11811.70s -> 11825.19s]  You're a newbie. You're up, newbie. All right. So grind the boxes. Did I screw it up? Did I mess
[11825.19s -> 11846.97s]  it up? Yes, I did. Oh boy. Okay. Did I get them all? Oh, that's tricky. This is tough. All right.
[11866.73s -> 11887.56s]  Oh, I missed one. I think I can get back up there. Right here. Where was it? No, you got to get it in
[11887.56s -> 11924.15s]  one go. You got to get it in one go. Oops. Floppy, but sloppy. What happened there? That was lame.
[11924.87s -> 11947.08s]  No, it's lame maybe. Not the job done. Yes. What do you mean timing? That's the guy from American
[11947.08s -> 11957.08s]  Dead. That's the boyfriend. All right. Let's do this. Let me see something basic for starters.
[11957.08s -> 12001.77s]  Yes. Yes. That's Jeff from American Dead. Double kickflip over the stairs. It needs to be faster
[12001.77s -> 12034.46s]  than that. There we go. Jeff, I did a triple kickflip. You can use it. Why can I not hit
[12034.46s -> 12073.99s]  this? Bang, bang. Bang, bang. Jeff, you got film in that camera? Double impossible over the stairs.
[12075.59s -> 12113.34s]  That was pretty cool. What's that called? Impossible? Come on. Stop doing that. Stop
[12113.34s -> 12124.23s]  doing the worst move. I don't even have special. Please wake up. You're unconscious.
[12125.19s -> 12133.32s]  Jeremy, please. Wake up. What are you doing? All right. Air out the atrium. All right. Here it is.
[12133.32s -> 12139.32s]  They want pictures of you blasting some big grab airs. Above us is a nice open gap over the front
[12139.32s -> 12147.70s]  of this atrium. It's perfect for these photos. Work up speed back and forth and do the grabs that I
[12147.70s -> 12153.70s]  tell you. Use a boneless to jump higher if you need to. Melon over the gap.
[12168.26s -> 12200.55s]  I got it, right? That wasn't it? Oh, I get it. I just felt like that was a melon. That was a melon.
[12201.27s -> 12244.55s]  Okay, I'll go out of the room. Hold on. That was a melon. How was that? That's not the gap.
[12245.11s -> 12247.51s]  I don't understand. I have to hit the gap?
[12256.26s -> 12279.64s]  How was that any different? I don't understand. Actually, let's take break number one. Let's take
[12279.64s -> 12283.72s]  a full break. I'm going to get some water. It's been three and a half hours. First break of the
[12283.72s -> 12565.72s]  night. I am back. I got myself a sprite on the rocks. Joe Otto? He's not even in the room anymore.
[12566.76s -> 12580.15s]  How's Otto after the surgery? He is fully healed. Stitches have been removed. He is back to 100%
[12580.15s -> 12589.75s]  normal. He's good to go. He's healed up very nicely. All right. Something a little tougher over the gap.
[12590.71s -> 12606.26s]  It's stiffy. I need some air. Let's get some air from here. Here we go. This will be it.
[12610.02s -> 12617.75s]  Just watch. I'm going to lose this twice.
[12617.75s -> 12643.18s]  Oh, shit. I'm so bad at this.
[12658.54s -> 12659.26s]  Oh, that was it.
[12663.26s -> 12670.25s]  That was it. I did it.
[12671.62s -> 12678.58s]  Oh, kid. You've got serious skills. How about another tough one over? Go for it.
[12679.54s -> 12681.94s]  This is rocket air over the gap.
[12690.26s -> 12696.58s]  I was not even in range of the photo. Crazy. You're unstoppable. They just want one more shot.
[12696.58s -> 12701.46s]  Let me see something really big over it. We're done here. One foot tail grab.
[12705.62s -> 12712.82s]  Six, and I still can't let them. All right, newbie. You want comfort. You gotta get creative.
[12712.82s -> 12718.74s]  Nail this run. Your picture will be in a magazine ad for sure. All right. I'll call out the tricks
[12718.74s -> 12724.98s]  and the team photographer will snap the photos. A really long spear or lance. How do you hold that?
[12727.54s -> 12731.22s]  I feel like that thing would turn. You know when we have a tape measure out too far and the thing
[12731.22s -> 12736.70s]  just goes to shit when it's out like that. I feel like that's impossible to hold and throw.
[12740.04s -> 12744.20s]  You just worry about busting them over the spine transfer on the statue.
[12744.20s -> 12749.08s]  Rock and roll, kid. Busting them over the spine transfer.
[12757.50s -> 12759.90s]  All right, I see. You get this L&R over the statue.
[12762.94s -> 12775.80s]  Cool. Bring it back. I get it. I get it. Tail grab over the statue.
[12779.85s -> 12789.08s]  Sloppy, but I did it. You want a bunch of kickflips. Sure, I can do that. No, I can't.
[12800.20s -> 12811.27s]  L, R, up, and X. It's like scratch your head, rub your face. Hold down X,
[12812.07s -> 12818.55s]  L, R, and then we let go of A, up, R. It's like a lot of my brain's processes.
[12819.51s -> 12847.53s]  Good. Try to do one at a time. Indie, then go over the statue. Melon.
[12856.30s -> 12865.03s]  Technically got it. Well, I'm going to make a joke or I'm going to drop out of high school.
[12865.99s -> 12869.98s]  Sorry, you're not going to be getting your diploma.
[12882.50s -> 12894.17s]  I don't like this one. I got to do two tricks in a row.
[12895.05s -> 12901.64s]  What do we got? Indie. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[12904.71s -> 12915.00s]  Okay, thank god it's a bunch of impossible in a row.
[12919.58s -> 12926.39s]  Kickflip. What the fuck was that? What? I didn't even want to do that, man.
[12927.99s -> 12957.45s]  Look at all these tricks. This might be it. I'm not going to get it. No more grab moves.
[12961.18s -> 12964.62s]  Make a joke. No, how many of you guys are going to drop out of high school if I don't make a joke
[12964.62s -> 12988.66s]  in 10 minutes? Stay in school for fuck's sake. But I graduated. Well, that's good.
[12989.70s -> 12996.78s]  Don't drop out of school because I didn't make a joke. All right. That first is just fucking with
[12996.78s -> 13058.82s]  me. Indie. No, do it again. Does that count? Not really. No grabs. No, just turn around and do it.
[13059.70s -> 13072.12s]  Okay, nose grab, heel flip. It wasn't a nose grab. Why? I just did up and B.
[13073.24s -> 13089.02s]  That's it. That one was hard. Real wink. Every day we get darker and darker.
[13106.04s -> 13111.40s]  What was the mission that the person said? If I do it within four tries, they'll give me like
[13111.40s -> 13114.68s]  a hundred dollars. It's like an impossible mission that they would like. This mission
[13114.68s -> 13117.24s]  sucks. You're going to hate it. But if you do it within four tries, I'll give you a hundred bucks.
[13118.36s -> 13133.69s]  Which one was it? It was like the spot, like the cool spot one, the cool spot or something.
[13133.69s -> 13142.02s]  Big apple spot challenge. Yeah. Okay. The big apple spot challenge. If I beat that within four
[13142.02s -> 13147.58s]  tries, they'll give me a hundred dollars. Nobody said that. Wow. Wow. Wow. Why would I even know
[13147.58s -> 13155.29s]  what that is? The cool, the apple, big apple spot. Man, we need to get some flyers thrown around
[13155.29s -> 13162.38s]  for this party. I said, I know it. Okay. I said I would throw up a cheese steak on my keyboard,
[13162.38s -> 13169.96s]  not give you a hundred dollars. I said nothing about a hundred dollars. You fucking greedy streamer.
[13178.10s -> 13184.74s]  Well, hold on a minute. Are you eating a cheese steak right now? Because that would make you a
[13184.74s -> 13194.18s]  liar if I did it within four tries. Like, did you, are you eating a cheese steak today?
[13199.86s -> 13204.92s]  Slap these flies around by doing wall plants. Okay. Cool. You'll see the spots where we want
[13204.92s -> 13210.82s]  to put up. What the fuck? I'm literally eating a cheese steak. Well, you don't, but you don't
[13210.82s -> 13247.94s]  have to throw it up onto your keyboard if I do it in four tries. Hold on a minute. He has a green
[13247.94s -> 13277.40s]  shirt on. Fuck. Nevermind. Oh, he got a friend. Don't just restart. It's fine. You don't have to
[13277.40s -> 13288.84s]  restart every time. What is he pretending? Stop pretending. There's no way this is not,
[13289.00s -> 13309.82s]  there's no way this guy's not pretending right now. There's two more. One here.
[13315.19s -> 13330.20s]  Great Marie's dumb. Great Marie's dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. I'm not dumb. You're dumb.
[13330.20s -> 13342.66s]  I'm not dumb. You're dumb. What do you got? The band that's playing your party. We stopped to get
[13342.66s -> 13349.16s]  some grub and while we were out some joker snaked our instruments. He's killing his streaming career.
[13351.82s -> 13354.94s]  Can you help us find him? Otherwise, we can't play for you guys.
[13355.58s -> 13358.54s]  All right, get the instruments. They're probably gonna be on a line here.
[13359.58s -> 13361.98s]  I was gonna guess. I'd be like, yeah, there's one.
[13363.98s -> 13379.80s]  Upset. Brums. I see a microphone.
[13388.17s -> 13399.11s]  I see. Let's go this way. There's a place where everyone can be happy.
[13399.11s -> 13402.15s]  Isn't the most beautiful place in the whole wide fucking world. That's the best song.
[13430.92s -> 13456.82s]  Oh, that's gonna be actually tricky to get to. Climb it. Really? The one place that hurts
[13457.78s -> 13470.44s]  is your knee. Those must be inflatable then. Get up in the chat. What's up, dude?
[13474.89s -> 13483.94s]  Grab that gardener's cart. Find a few ladies. Do whatever it takes to get them back here.
[13485.94s -> 13490.10s]  Don't be slacking. If you don't hurry up, this party's gonna be over before it really starts.
[13491.46s -> 13498.66s]  Tony, let me do some consulting work for you. I love these games and as you can see,
[13498.66s -> 13503.30s]  I get 20 to 30,000 points when I get in a line so I know the game.
[13507.21s -> 13510.73s]  Maybe if you show me how handy you are with that skateboard, I'll come to your party.
[13510.73s -> 13523.14s]  How about showing me a combo? You want to say a combo? Show me a combo. How's that?
[13523.94s -> 13541.54s]  Shit. Did you just hit my car? Stay right there. I'll do it. My face is a Jehovah.
[13563.19s -> 13572.52s]  Coming to the party. Wait, pick up girls for the party. I can only have one person in this car.
[13573.48s -> 13583.75s]  Well, she'd go anywhere. I'm not that easy. If you want me to go to your party,
[13583.75s -> 13587.03s]  you're gonna have to show me more. How about some of those neat freestyle tricks?
[13587.03s -> 13590.07s]  What do you mean freestyle tricks? Start manually and show me some tricks.
[13604.95s -> 13607.27s]  You're asking a lot in a row.
[13613.16s -> 13637.03s]  Okay, who cares? I'm just gonna go this way.
[13637.03s -> 13673.03s]  Be an X. That's a weird combo to do. It's hard. Your hands can't do that.
[13679.98s -> 13684.49s]  I have to be in front of you? Why can't you just walk with me?
[13695.51s -> 13697.51s]  I'm doing it. Look.
[13718.62s -> 13727.50s]  Damn it. This is fucking tricky.
[13734.30s -> 13737.50s]  Bill Emanuel, you motherfucker.
[13758.82s -> 13763.30s]  Are you happy? All right, let's go.
[13766.10s -> 13769.30s]  Make room and I'll come to the party.
[13779.34s -> 13792.98s]  Everybody good? I thought it was a ramp.
[13805.10s -> 13807.10s]  NA navigation.
[13814.78s -> 13817.10s]  Whoa, I just like this. What the fuck did I just do?
[13829.85s -> 13871.50s]  All right, do I have to be in front of you? Let me see. No, good. Car hop. Oh, don't reset.
[13872.39s -> 13882.42s]  No, don't flush her. What I Xbox 360.
[13883.14s -> 13903.58s]  I'm coming to your party. Even if I do have to write in that thing. Let's go.
[13903.58s -> 13937.88s]  Jerma looks like the mom from Dexter's lab. Yeah. Yeah, kind of. Kind of. Whatever.
[13947.24s -> 13952.52s]  If I flip this thing, I don't hurt anybody. All right, we got a full house.
[13953.32s -> 13964.26s]  Hey, I snuck out of the party and hooked up some real fun. What does that mean?
[13964.26s -> 13968.58s]  I snaked one of those cards from behind the epitheter. Okay. And some of the other guys
[13968.58s -> 13973.99s]  set up a little racetrack for us. See if you can beat my best lap. In the car?
[13973.99s -> 13977.27s]  It's going to take some skittles as that dork Todd likes to put it.
[13978.31s -> 13988.81s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, my dork. Beat Jordan's best lap. This arrow is not helping me.
[14000.71s -> 14031.29s]  It counts. Hit it.
[14038.86s -> 14042.12s]  You want to save? Yes.
[14045.08s -> 14050.79s]  SpongeBob driving test. What's wrong with me?
[14051.75s -> 14057.74s]  There you are. Hey, come on. It's two in the afternoon and you're still asleep.
[14057.74s -> 14064.97s]  You got to skate the demo at three. You know what demo? The team demo. Come on. I want you
[14064.97s -> 14069.37s]  to get the new guy. Yeah, I do. I look like, look, I look like it's Dexter. Dexter character.
[14070.17s -> 14076.01s]  You're on the team. It's like Dexter's older cousin. That's cool. I can see how busy you've been.
[14076.65s -> 14083.54s]  Oh, you guys know each other? Anyway, why don't you find the rest of the team? They scattered
[14083.54s -> 14092.04s]  after the party. I'll see you guys at the demo after I chow down. All right. So yeah,
[14092.92s -> 14100.07s]  new friend became enemy. Good thing they're all right here.
[14107.88s -> 14114.38s]  Other than you and me, the rest of the guys on the team kind of got lost or wandered off.
[14114.78s -> 14120.18s]  Mm hmm. You need to round him up. Why distract Todd? Or we're going to have to cancel the demo.
[14120.90s -> 14126.71s]  All right, the team members. Do they have an indicator or they're just lying around?
[14127.59s -> 14150.73s]  Do they have a green indicator? Good one. What? Yeah, they do have an indicator. Hey, get over here.
[14151.45s -> 14170.36s]  You're going to miss the demo, man. Come on. It's going to be some kind of record.
[14190.63s -> 14194.79s]  I'm just like skating around. Yeah, I'm just having fun. I shouldn't be doing that. I need
[14194.79s -> 14218.79s]  to go find these guys. No fun allowed. Get up there.
[14226.50s -> 14231.78s]  I got to go up and around this whole thing. Oh, shit. Do I actually have to do this?
[14234.98s -> 14237.78s]  Am I going to climb it? I don't think I can climb it anywhere.
[14243.75s -> 14248.31s]  You got to grind it. Oh, wait, there's a pipe here.
[14248.31s -> 14251.19s]  I know you want to make move, my son. You best take a second look.
[14251.19s -> 14252.07s]  You're going to get some super here.
[14258.36s -> 14259.00s]  I don't think it's going to be enough.
[14269.30s -> 14273.62s]  I got to go the other way. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Get up. All right, I got it.
[14273.62s -> 14281.37s]  I'm trying to snatch it after the laughter won't cease from the comparison. I dare you, son.
[14281.37s -> 14281.77s]  Stupid.
[14300.25s -> 14300.89s]  Stop having fun.
[14300.89s -> 14332.04s]  All right. Let me get this guy first. Oh, I went by him.
[14333.27s -> 14339.91s]  Blame, blame, blame, blame, blame, dude, blame, blame.
[14339.99s -> 14344.10s]  Blame.
[14389.69s -> 14400.31s]  I mean, this is pretty sick. I have to do it.
[14400.95s -> 14410.31s]  All right.
[14420.95s -> 14428.31s]  OK, I need three more.
[14431.11s -> 14433.11s]  I'm here. I think I'll find you.
[14448.94s -> 14449.82s]  Somebody up here, right?
[14460.76s -> 14461.32s]  Where are you?
[14461.32s -> 14476.47s]  No, but again, where are you?
[14485.67s -> 14486.47s]  No.
[14486.47s -> 14498.76s]  Damn it. Where are these other three people?
[14499.40s -> 14504.94s]  You in here?
[14505.66s -> 14515.70s]  No, nobody in here. I'm not going to do it.
[14520.81s -> 14521.53s]  Somebody there.
[14523.21s -> 14526.87s]  That's only one. You're also a fucking mess.
[14527.51s -> 14534.22s]  All right. I remember this one. Sorry.
[14539.14s -> 14544.92s]  Apparently, I got them. These other two hidden fucking people.
[14545.88s -> 14549.05s]  All right. Come on. One more. One more.
[14549.05s -> 14551.29s]  Where's the last one? I need one more guy.
[14551.29s -> 14563.77s]  Come on. 13 seconds. Oh, my God.
[14574.10s -> 14575.62s]  I never found this guy.
[14576.50s -> 14579.99s]  Hide in a bush. All right. Let's go.
[14580.71s -> 14604.52s]  Let's get him. I did find him, though.
[14604.52s -> 14606.12s]  That's true. I did. I did find him.
[14607.91s -> 14610.55s]  Two. Three is that way.
[14611.51s -> 14618.25s]  Got to get up here and grind it.
[14618.97s -> 14620.68s]  It's not what I wanted to do.
[14621.56s -> 14623.64s]  What are you, a dumb person?
[14625.00s -> 14639.62s]  Okay. Two more.
[14643.06s -> 14645.30s]  There was somebody in this building over here.
[14648.22s -> 14652.36s]  Stop. And where is the other one?
[14653.72s -> 14655.32s]  I got three minutes at most to find him.
[14656.68s -> 14658.76s]  All right. Any doctors in chat?
[14659.64s -> 14660.84s]  Are there any doctors in here?
[14662.04s -> 14668.36s]  All right. What does it mean when my entire face is itchy?
[14669.16s -> 14672.23s]  They never stop. And I don't have any allergies.
[14672.23s -> 14672.79s]  What does that mean?
[14673.59s -> 14684.78s]  Every three to four minutes, I have an itchy spot somewhere on my face.
[14685.74s -> 14691.69s]  What does that mean? My man's dry.
[14691.69s -> 14693.45s]  No, no, no. No, I'm not a moisturizer.
[14693.45s -> 14695.62s]  Looks like we got our cart back.
[14695.62s -> 14698.34s]  And there's some free skateboards on the back.
[14698.34s -> 14703.86s]  How nice of you punks to leave these here for us after you stole our cart in the first place.
[14704.50s -> 14705.54s]  Have a nice day.
[14706.42s -> 14710.42s]  What do we do?
[14711.06s -> 14712.84s]  Just hitch for 60 seconds.
[14717.00s -> 14722.04s]  Oh, that doesn't seem fair.
[14723.16s -> 14744.89s]  All right. It's like Temple Run.
[14745.69s -> 14766.71s]  That hurt. Mobile gaming streamer.
[14766.71s -> 14768.55s]  And then I played Temple Run maybe once.
[14769.85s -> 14771.77s]  But that's what this mechanic is.
[14773.29s -> 14776.50s]  This is not even me doing this.
[14777.78s -> 14780.58s]  This guy's just running over everybody he's at work with.
[14780.58s -> 14782.18s]  No, don't. I'm so close.
[14782.18s -> 14782.90s]  Just get over here.
[14783.86s -> 14788.30s]  Come here.
[14796.66s -> 14800.18s]  No, stop. Wait, wait for me.
[14808.47s -> 14810.71s]  What was that move? What was that guy doing?
[14811.51s -> 14812.71s]  Come on. I'm so close.
[14813.51s -> 14825.59s]  My God. I can't believe it.
[14825.59s -> 14859.80s]  All right. That was stupid.
[14859.80s -> 14861.24s]  I'm going so fast right now.
[14874.36s -> 14877.00s]  You got to pay attention to the bar and the ring.
[14879.96s -> 14893.90s]  I'll give you fucking 60 bucks if you can beat this first try.
[14893.90s -> 14894.54s]  Right, Gerber?
[14894.54s -> 14898.12s]  No. Will you really?
[14898.68s -> 14903.88s]  Nope. I'm just going to throw up a ham sandwich on my keyboard or something.
[14916.71s -> 14938.04s]  Get it. Don't let go.
[14942.81s -> 14947.98s]  Okay. It's coming down here, right?
[14948.62s -> 14964.78s]  Okay. View goals. The only public one or two left, right?
[14964.78s -> 14967.18s]  Breeze the crowd. Find more kids.
[14980.09s -> 14983.45s]  I love the Sonic the Hedgehog actor.
[14984.41s -> 14985.05s]  That people do.
[14986.17s -> 14999.10s]  That'll itch my fucking like rotten face.
[15001.83s -> 15014.54s]  Ready? Three, two, one. Let's go.
[15030.28s -> 15032.52s]  It's time for you guys. It's time for you to pay.
[15033.16s -> 15037.21s]  Anyway, if you're as good as they say you are,
[15037.21s -> 15040.09s]  then do whatever grind I tell you to up on that raised bar.
[15041.05s -> 15042.97s]  Sure. Grind the bar.
[15047.93s -> 15050.25s]  Nosebleed. A double nosebleed.
[15051.13s -> 15062.97s]  All right, let's do it. Can I switch it up?
[15064.09s -> 15071.32s]  Ooh. 50-50. Nice.
[15073.82s -> 15075.74s]  Re-50-50 is going to noseblunt.
[15076.46s -> 15086.82s]  He's instantly just retrying every single failure.
[15086.82s -> 15089.86s]  Yeah, that's what you do.
[15091.06s -> 15092.34s]  I thought you got it.
[15092.34s -> 15095.46s]  You got it because it's not clean in your brain and you don't want to do it.
[15097.59s -> 15100.55s]  Like for instance, I would have just restarted right there,
[15100.55s -> 15101.91s]  but I might still be able to do it.
[15126.31s -> 15127.11s]  Go faster.
[15127.11s -> 15141.14s]  Restart Randy. Restart Randy.
[15144.58s -> 15146.66s]  Faster, faster. I'm going as fast as I can.
[15148.10s -> 15150.74s]  How is that not fucking Xbox 360 controller?
[15157.78s -> 15175.37s]  I got it.
[15211.32s -> 15211.96s]  Nose brine.
[15212.76s -> 15214.36s]  Good. Good RNG.
[15220.30s -> 15220.78s]  Pop-pop.
[15224.50s -> 15225.22s]  Good RNG.
[15227.38s -> 15232.62s]  Look at that RNG. It's like playing Tetris.
[15257.74s -> 15258.46s]  I'll try.
[15260.06s -> 15262.46s]  All right, reporter. Take a look at this one.
[15263.10s -> 15265.10s]  Get a huge score to impress the media.
[15283.29s -> 15291.53s]  Oh, what? You bought that in one combo?
[15291.53s -> 15292.25s]  Is that what you wanted?
[15304.26s -> 15306.50s]  Get special and press just before the lip.
[15307.14s -> 15334.55s]  All right, what do you want to do?
[15335.83s -> 15341.82s]  Press right just before lipping on the stage lights.
[15351.03s -> 15353.72s]  Is that it? I don't think that's right.
[15353.80s -> 15362.52s]  All right, right, right, yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
[15378.82s -> 15382.14s]  Turbo walk. I did it right.
[15382.94s -> 15384.57s]  Does that count?
[15404.30s -> 15404.70s]  There you go.
[15411.10s -> 15411.90s]  Going to Hawaii.
[15415.74s -> 15423.26s]  Can you believe it? Hawaii. You must be stoked.
[15423.26s -> 15425.50s]  The team usually doesn't bring hams on a trip this big.
[15426.22s -> 15429.18s]  And those sketches are awesome. Did you draw them?
[15429.18s -> 15432.62s]  No, some artists did. They're the graphics for my new pro model.
[15434.39s -> 15437.27s]  Hey, how long were you on the team before you turned pro?
[15437.83s -> 15441.99s]  About a year. I just threw down a couple of hammers for the last video
[15441.99s -> 15445.11s]  and the response was so crazy. They gave me a pro board.
[15446.15s -> 15449.35s]  Who knows? Do the same. Maybe they'll turn you pro in a few years.
[15449.59s -> 15450.95s]  What's wrong with your character?
[15452.47s -> 15454.23s]  It's a weird glitch that happens in the game sometimes.
[15454.23s -> 15455.51s]  This is original Xbox, by the way.
[15456.71s -> 15460.55s]  If you get more than two million points in one combo,
[15460.55s -> 15463.43s]  the game can kind of fuck up and when it loads the actual combo,
[15463.43s -> 15465.51s]  all right, you can mess up your character and shit.
[15465.51s -> 15468.55s]  We paid for your trip to Hawaii. Getting sick footage is your job.
[15471.19s -> 15474.55s]  Then we're going to premiere our video in Vancouver at the Slam City Jam.
[15474.55s -> 15477.11s]  So don't half ass it. We hook up in three days.
[15481.13s -> 15494.47s]  I need a rabbit.
[15494.47s -> 15498.23s]  Nothing says aloha like getting laid. Collect five lays.
[15499.19s -> 15518.60s]  Five lays. Let's get it. Sucks. I wonder if it's failed.
[15520.28s -> 15548.71s]  Consoles ever. Like the 360. All right, two more down here.
[15549.83s -> 15577.96s]  I took a lot from me to not restart. There's only one more after this.
[15610.97s -> 15634.17s]  Over here is the one I didn't get. Didn't get it. Too hard.
[15634.17s -> 15645.08s]  Inside that bar. Restart Robert.
[15646.23s -> 15648.71s]  Restart Andy. Restart Randy.
[15649.75s -> 15655.88s]  This is Tony Hawk. If you are not one thousand percent happy
[15655.88s -> 15658.52s]  every tenth of a second, you restart the mission.
[15658.52s -> 15661.88s]  Good footage of destruction. Pineapples explode real nice.
[15661.88s -> 15665.08s]  Let's see a smash five pineapple stance. Smash five pineapples.
[15666.28s -> 15687.19s]  Apparently it wasn't enough. Can't wait.
[15688.97s -> 15707.82s]  Popping in here. What else is here?
[15715.03s -> 15718.23s]  Jump into Tiki. Tiki. Go to the Tiki.
[15730.92s -> 15735.03s]  Jump in Tiki. Where is it?
[15759.83s -> 15764.63s]  Hey, first big trip. Paradise is pretty sweet until you smash your face on a banyan tree.
[15765.67s -> 15769.75s]  Remember, you're here to skate, not to play official bikini inspector.
[15769.75s -> 15771.19s]  Look, why don't you just show me what you got?
[15772.71s -> 15775.19s]  Get special, then do a crook's dark slide grind.
[15775.19s -> 15777.03s]  Lock on to it long enough to show me you got it.
[15777.99s -> 15804.10s]  I say it every time I stop talking. I even do that.
[15804.98s -> 15810.02s]  I intentionally jumped off the board and tried to neck myself on the ground.
[15811.14s -> 15812.18s]  You can't even do that.
[15821.45s -> 15822.57s]  All right, what does he want me to do?
[15823.53s -> 15826.73s]  Crook's dark slide. Hold it long enough so I know you're good.
[15827.77s -> 15842.89s]  You all right? That wasn't long enough?
[15843.69s -> 15847.05s]  What are you doing?
[15848.09s -> 15851.05s]  What are you doing? Stop moving me around.
[15874.15s -> 15878.47s]  Okay, here we go. Show me a crook's dark slide.
[15882.76s -> 15884.36s]  All right, I have to hold it for seven seconds.
[15884.36s -> 15886.36s]  Where the hell am I going to do it for seven seconds?
[15889.14s -> 15890.34s]  How am I going to do it for that long?
[15890.98s -> 15897.38s]  It's going to go very slow. Come on.
[15897.38s -> 15899.30s]  Three, two, one.
[15908.33s -> 15909.13s]  Oh, I did it.
[15911.37s -> 15911.93s]  Restart ready.
[15916.33s -> 15918.25s]  Restart, Randy. That's me.
[15918.25s -> 15919.85s]  Hey, by the way, anybody just open the screen?
[15927.02s -> 15930.06s]  There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there.
[15930.06s -> 15930.38s]  Where?
[15934.82s -> 15935.54s]  What do you want me to do?
[15941.66s -> 15943.82s]  Other way, other way, other way.
[15945.42s -> 15949.50s]  I am literally screaming at my fucking monitor.
[15949.58s -> 15949.90s]  Where?
[15951.26s -> 15955.42s]  God, there, right fucking there.
[15955.42s -> 15957.42s]  Oh, my God, I'm screaming.
[15957.42s -> 15960.86s]  I'm grabbing my TV and screaming at it.
[16000.26s -> 16001.38s]  Oh, that was crazy.
[16003.14s -> 16005.54s]  Oh, no, it's bugleberry.
[16006.82s -> 16016.36s]  Missed it.
[16016.36s -> 16017.64s]  I don't even know what I was supposed to be doing.
[16018.84s -> 16019.48s]  I'll try it again.
[16043.64s -> 16044.50s]  Okay, here we go.
[16051.37s -> 16054.34s]  No, I don't.
[16061.43s -> 16062.55s]  That's not me doing the voice.
[16062.55s -> 16063.11s]  It doesn't count.
[16068.34s -> 16069.70s]  Right there, right there.
[16069.70s -> 16071.30s]  I know I'm trying to.
[16071.30s -> 16073.30s]  There's like a videotape or something I can grab.
[16074.02s -> 16077.66s]  I don't think my oddly is good enough to get it.
[16077.66s -> 16078.16s]  Try it again.
[16078.94s -> 16086.79s]  Old school icon.
[16086.79s -> 16087.35s]  Congratulations.
[16087.35s -> 16088.87s]  You've unlocked an old school level.
[16088.87s -> 16090.95s]  Venice from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
[16092.15s -> 16102.12s]  Okay, I can't restart.
[16105.08s -> 16105.72s]  Wedding guest.
[16106.36s -> 16109.74s]  There are lots of people getting married around here.
[16109.74s -> 16113.58s]  Why don't you try to get some footage with four sets of brides and grooms?
[16113.58s -> 16115.58s]  Perform the trick and I'll take the shot.
[16117.56s -> 16118.68s]  Some wedding footage?
[16119.56s -> 16120.84s]  But I have to do a kick flip.
[16120.84s -> 16124.04s]  Why would you want to kick flip somebody doing a kick flip behind your wedding photo?
[16126.44s -> 16139.80s]  This is the shit that you tell the guy to photoshop out of the frame.
[16156.86s -> 16157.50s]  Wrong couple.
[16159.82s -> 16160.14s]  What?
[16160.14s -> 16161.34s]  He's aiming camera over here.
[16162.86s -> 16167.50s]  Next couple?
[16192.62s -> 16193.34s]  Yeah, right.
[16193.98s -> 16194.70s]  That's so stupid.
[16200.70s -> 16204.78s]  What do they want?
[16204.78s -> 16206.14s]  Impossible.
[16212.84s -> 16224.20s]  Get it?
[16231.08s -> 16242.20s]  Be discreet.
[16268.15s -> 16269.51s]  I drowned in the pool.
[16269.51s -> 16281.02s]  Okay, where's this other couple?
[16282.06s -> 16282.89s]  From here?
[16283.77s -> 16288.86s]  Where's this other couple?
[16288.86s -> 16289.66s]  Fucking Xbox.
[16289.66s -> 16290.38s]  Fucking stupid.
[16290.38s -> 16291.58s]  Fucking shittiest console.
[16291.58s -> 16292.30s]  Fucking Xbox.
[16292.30s -> 16293.02s]  Fucking stupid.
[16293.82s -> 16295.42s]  Where's the other couple?
[16308.23s -> 16310.15s]  Getting old console bumping and stuff.
[16310.15s -> 16311.11s]  Fucking shitty thing.
[16312.47s -> 16333.59s]  Some of you new viewers.
[16334.39s -> 16337.27s]  I don't know what I'm doing right there, but some of you old viewers know.
[16340.10s -> 16341.46s]  Come on, where's the last couple?
[16348.22s -> 16348.94s]  What?
[16348.94s -> 16350.07s]  I don't have a special.
[16350.07s -> 16350.95s]  Why is that even possible?
[16351.75s -> 16399.43s]  Okay, where's the last couple?
[16400.31s -> 16401.27s]  This other one's over here.
[16402.47s -> 16404.44s]  There's one where?
[16405.62s -> 16405.86s]  Where?
[16406.84s -> 16407.32s]  Right here.
[16409.11s -> 16410.23s]  Where's the last one?
[16411.11s -> 16412.76s]  Where?
[16415.70s -> 16416.02s]  There.
[16417.11s -> 16417.83s]  Right there.
[16417.83s -> 16418.71s]  Where's the last one?
[16420.84s -> 16421.56s]  In the teak.
[16421.56s -> 16422.84s]  Oh, that would be rude.
[16422.84s -> 16425.35s]  Seriously.
[16425.35s -> 16426.07s]  Where the hell are they?
[16430.28s -> 16430.84s]  Up, are they?
[16431.88s -> 16469.69s]  Come on.
[16469.69s -> 16471.21s]  Sometimes you have to just be calm down.
[16471.21s -> 16472.01s]  Just calm down.
[16472.01s -> 16474.41s]  First wall plant the vending machine three times.
[16475.21s -> 16477.69s]  Come on.
[16477.69s -> 16480.33s]  Let me adjust my, uh, my fucking bionic boomer vest.
[16481.29s -> 16490.25s]  Come on, comfortable?
[16491.53s -> 16493.69s]  All right, first wall plant the vending machines three times.
[16496.33s -> 16501.67s]  This is some.
[16502.31s -> 16506.95s]  This is some stupid secret how to get to the DLC in Bloodborne or Dark Souls.
[16506.95s -> 16507.67s]  Here it comes.
[16520.18s -> 16523.54s]  Now, acid drop from that platform up there into the pool.
[16523.54s -> 16528.02s]  I bet it'll make a big enough splash to make the security guard drop his candy bar into the pool.
[16528.02s -> 16528.66s]  Acid drop.
[16528.66s -> 16529.54s]  Yeah, acid drop.
[16529.54s -> 16531.14s]  Jump out over the pool and press.
[16532.26s -> 16532.74s]  Press what?
[16534.10s -> 16535.38s]  Press skeezo, press what?
[16536.42s -> 16539.53s]  Is he all right?
[16574.49s -> 16586.33s]  Um, acid drop.
[16586.33s -> 16599.11s]  Jump out over the pool and press L and R for two ladders.
[16599.11s -> 16602.76s]  Okay, but I can't even get over there.
[16609.61s -> 16610.01s]  All right.
[16610.01s -> 16612.41s]  This so fucking finicky being on this legend.
[16618.33s -> 16641.37s]  What?
[16646.25s -> 16659.74s]  All that just to throw a candy bar on the pool.
[16659.90s -> 16664.68s]  I think we're at the, uh, check out this clip from wallows.
[16667.53s -> 16669.82s]  Whoa, and that's some heavy footage.
[16670.54s -> 16672.22s]  What you got going?
[16672.22s -> 16675.50s]  Um, I have some secret spot I just found.
[16675.50s -> 16676.54s]  It's pretty gnarly.
[16676.54s -> 16677.82s]  I'm going to shoot it later today.
[16678.78s -> 16679.66s]  That's cool.
[16679.66s -> 16681.26s]  Give me a ring if you need help shooting it.
[16681.26s -> 16685.74s]  It'd be like old this guy middle in an animorph into a root vegetable.
[16687.03s -> 16689.67s]  I think that's the actual description of what it is.
[16690.71s -> 16705.18s]  Lots of places on the island to get some good lip trick.
[16706.30s -> 16708.22s]  Find the four lip trick spots.
[16708.22s -> 16708.78s]  Lip trick.
[16709.50s -> 16712.70s]  And hold a lip trick at each spot long enough for me to get some footage.
[16722.58s -> 16723.86s]  Where's the lip trick up here?
[16725.06s -> 16727.37s]  Up there.
[16736.66s -> 16737.94s]  Is there a half pipe here?
[16739.06s -> 16742.17s]  This ain't a half pipe, it is.
[16756.28s -> 16763.10s]  I gotta go.
[16763.82s -> 16765.77s]  Everything's closed up.
[16776.84s -> 16777.08s]  Good.
[16777.64s -> 16778.36s]  Thank you.
[16780.38s -> 16783.66s]  That one is one over here somewhere that I saw right there.
[16783.66s -> 16791.58s]  Do a Russian bonus or riot.
[16792.94s -> 16796.26s]  There, I did a.
[16798.12s -> 16798.52s]  Invert.
[16799.40s -> 16801.91s]  Be happy.
[16804.09s -> 16804.73s]  No, you know what?
[16804.73s -> 16805.13s]  You know what?
[16805.13s -> 16806.25s]  No, you know, ban that guy.
[16806.89s -> 16807.61s]  Ban that person.
[16808.33s -> 16809.45s]  Unbelievable.
[16809.45s -> 16822.57s]  We don't take requests on this channel and I'm gonna put my foot down on that.
[16831.85s -> 16833.13s]  No, I do the lip trick.
[16834.33s -> 16838.95s]  Quick, somebody redeem a wink.
[16839.83s -> 16841.96s]  Here it is.
[16845.88s -> 16846.76s]  Nice.
[16848.28s -> 16850.41s]  How long can I hold a manual for?
[16850.41s -> 16852.17s]  I need to hold it for like 10 seconds.
[16853.77s -> 16864.07s]  There it is.
[16864.07s -> 16864.55s]  15.
[16867.02s -> 16871.54s]  Oh, everybody in the room just ran.
[16871.54s -> 16890.25s]  Ooh, the annual plus one to even get 20.
[16905.54s -> 16906.26s]  How long was that?
[16907.06s -> 16915.29s]  God, manualing is free.
[16916.81s -> 16919.69s]  This ditch here is called off the walls.
[16919.69s -> 16921.45s]  Manual to the end in one combo.
[16921.45s -> 16924.09s]  To make it harder, do a handstand while you're at it.
[16925.05s -> 16926.09s]  I know what it's gonna be.
[16929.93s -> 16931.69s]  The last one got redeemed an hour ago.
[16931.69s -> 16932.25s]  I can see it.
[16933.37s -> 16942.49s]  All right, we want to do manual down off the wall.
[16945.05s -> 16945.53s]  Hold on.
[16945.53s -> 16947.29s]  Manual off the wall and do a handstand.
[16949.53s -> 16959.26s]  My hands got sucked in.
[16973.72s -> 16974.12s]  Not it?
[16974.76s -> 16975.96s]  Manual down off the wall.
[16984.76s -> 16987.24s]  Manual down off the walls and do a handstand.
[16987.24s -> 16988.20s]  Should I bounce off the wall?
[16988.84s -> 16989.48s]  Real wink.
[16990.44s -> 17013.02s]  What do I need to hold it for?
[17013.02s -> 17021.50s]  Do the whole thing or something?
[17021.50s -> 17035.75s]  Manual down off the wall.
[17035.75s -> 17036.55s]  Down?
[17036.55s -> 17049.80s]  Maybe it wants to be like actually dropped down.
[17051.16s -> 17059.61s]  Not it?
[17060.65s -> 17089.19s]  Do I have to make it the entire way?
[17090.15s -> 17094.31s]  Am I gonna run out of steam here and not even touch the wall?
[17095.19s -> 17099.61s]  Oh, and I did it.
[17101.77s -> 17102.65s]  That was weird, okay?
[17104.01s -> 17110.12s]  I did well.
[17111.88s -> 17114.92s]  Impress the girls.
[17117.50s -> 17119.90s]  Ladies love the big combos.
[17120.62s -> 17125.98s]  See if you can impress three groups of bikini girls by landing big combos in front of each one.
[17126.54s -> 17126.94s]  All right.
[17135.90s -> 17136.70s]  No, I gotta go.
[17137.50s -> 17139.10s]  I've got more people to impress.
[17140.31s -> 17141.43s]  But I will, ladies.
[17142.23s -> 17143.35s]  I'll leave you with it.
[17145.98s -> 17172.92s]  What was that?
[17172.92s -> 17173.88s]  I put it between my legs.
[17210.54s -> 17212.54s]  Did that not count?
[17223.10s -> 17223.34s]  No.
[17224.46s -> 17237.19s]  All right, ladies.
[17237.83s -> 17238.55s]  Get away.
[17239.45s -> 17240.09s]  Don't restart.
[17265.77s -> 17266.49s]  I want to impress it.
[17287.32s -> 17287.96s]  66.
[17288.84s -> 17304.34s]  There it is.
[17305.14s -> 17305.62s]  All right.
[17305.62s -> 17306.42s]  Make it nice and easy.
[17307.38s -> 17310.26s]  Let's get out of this hole.
[17312.78s -> 17313.26s]  All right.
[17313.26s -> 17313.66s]  You know what?
[17313.66s -> 17314.86s]  I'm just gonna manual in front of you guys.
[17315.50s -> 17317.50s]  Because this is, I, here we go.
[17317.50s -> 17317.82s]  Ready?
[17351.43s -> 17351.91s]  Damn it.
[17359.45s -> 17361.45s]  Your combos are so big.
[17375.75s -> 17377.75s]  Your combos are so big.
[17378.71s -> 17383.74s]  Here we go.
[17384.70s -> 17387.56s]  I almost just restarted.
[17397.72s -> 17405.10s]  I thought she was T-posing.
[17405.10s -> 17405.82s]  No, dancing.
[17406.78s -> 17408.66s]  Mahalo.
[17408.66s -> 17411.30s]  Welcome to the beautiful island of Hawaii.
[17411.30s -> 17413.06s]  Please join our skate competition.
[17416.58s -> 17417.78s]  Metal competition?
[17418.74s -> 17419.78s]  I didn't know I was starting.
[17420.74s -> 17432.62s]  That was a big one.
[17432.62s -> 17441.66s]  Here we go.
[17457.27s -> 17459.91s]  That's what we call saving at the end.
[17504.15s -> 17505.67s]  I'm trying so hard.
[17505.67s -> 17517.06s]  Fucking way.
[17518.14s -> 17520.78s]  This is skateboarding competition, you fucking idiots.
[17521.66s -> 17533.94s]  Four.
[17533.94s -> 17541.66s]  Am I just standing in the middle of the half pipe?
[17542.54s -> 17543.58s]  Having a conversation?
[17544.30s -> 17545.42s]  What is wrong with you guys?
[17547.58s -> 17548.62s]  I can't restart that.
[17565.30s -> 17565.86s]  Bullvine.
[17565.86s -> 17566.98s]  Bullvine Ernie.
[17566.98s -> 17567.94s]  Or Germer Rumble.
[17568.66s -> 17571.75s]  What are the goals?
[17571.75s -> 17573.08s]  What did I just do?
[17573.08s -> 17573.80s]  No.
[17573.80s -> 17574.44s]  View goals.
[17576.95s -> 17578.31s]  Wallows combo balls.
[17580.20s -> 17581.48s]  Or high lines.
[17583.16s -> 17584.28s]  Kill wallows.
[17591.80s -> 17595.80s]  You'll have to top trick on the houses, fences, and balconies here in wallows.
[17614.81s -> 17615.37s]  More air.
[17632.44s -> 17637.96s]  Come on.
[17637.96s -> 17638.44s]  Get up there.
[17639.00s -> 17673.34s]  It's out of bounds.
[17674.14s -> 17687.13s]  It's like trying to get on the fence.
[17688.39s -> 17688.95s]  There we go.
[17689.67s -> 17706.71s]  That would have been like 200,000.
[17707.35s -> 17725.38s]  Five.
[17725.38s -> 17740.70s]  Already got this one.
[17745.13s -> 17750.50s]  I'm trying to get on the fences and the houses, but it's hard to do it too.
[17750.50s -> 17752.50s]  What the fuck is wrong with this?
[17753.38s -> 17753.86s]  Do it again.
[17754.58s -> 17787.54s]  Yeah, okay.
[17787.54s -> 17788.66s]  I got Ollie too.
[17796.28s -> 17796.76s]  Four more.
[17796.76s -> 17797.56s]  What have I not done?
[17797.56s -> 17798.04s]  Which house?
[17799.32s -> 17800.38s]  All right.
[17800.38s -> 17801.10s]  There's a...
[17801.10s -> 17801.74s]  It's up here.
[17802.70s -> 17804.39s]  Let me go back this way.
[17804.39s -> 17807.72s]  Nope.
[17807.72s -> 17808.04s]  Ah.
[17808.60s -> 17810.94s]  I'm gonna go five.
[17811.74s -> 17817.70s]  Did that count?
[17817.70s -> 17818.20s]  Yeah.
[17819.14s -> 17820.10s]  What am I even on?
[17833.34s -> 17833.84s]  Shit.
[17834.30s -> 17840.81s]  I'm trying to find a way to...
[17840.81s -> 17841.77s]  Like while you turn...
[17841.77s -> 17843.53s]  Like I'm trying to get on the ledge here.
[17843.53s -> 17844.65s]  There we go.
[17844.65s -> 17845.64s]  That's it.
[17846.74s -> 17848.36s]  One more.
[17848.36s -> 17849.56s]  What piece of fence did I not touch?
[17852.06s -> 17853.58s]  Fence or a piece of a house or something?
[17854.70s -> 17855.10s]  Come on.
[17856.14s -> 17858.41s]  Oh, come on.
[17861.80s -> 17862.36s]  Come on.
[17862.36s -> 17862.86s]  Anything.
[17865.54s -> 17866.50s]  Literally anything.
[17866.50s -> 17867.00s]  A house.
[17870.47s -> 17870.97s]  There it is.
[17871.43s -> 17871.93s]  End it.
[17894.04s -> 17895.16s]  Dude's fucking naked.
[17896.50s -> 17896.98s]  Big bits?
[17896.98s -> 17898.18s]  What do you mean big bits?
[17898.18s -> 17898.68s]  Where?
[17899.78s -> 17900.66s]  Oh, Jesus.
[17903.64s -> 17907.24s]  Freakout gave like $150 over the course of like three...
[17909.06s -> 17910.18s]  Five different things.
[17910.98s -> 17926.06s]  What?
[17926.28s -> 17926.78s]  What?
[17927.32s -> 17927.82s]  Why?
[17927.88s -> 17928.60s]  What is this?
[17957.51s -> 17961.74s]  However, the Yanks still had to reply to the Germans.
[17961.74s -> 17964.06s]  Otherwise, they'd be wiped out by the shelling.
[17964.06s -> 17966.06s]  While trying to find proper response to the letter,
[17966.06s -> 17971.50s]  Lieutenant Colonel Kynard said that the McCallum said basically summed up the situation.
[17971.50s -> 17974.46s]  So when the Americans finished their letter and sent to the...
[17974.46s -> 17975.50s]  This is what it said.
[17975.50s -> 17976.22s]  They sent a letter.
[17976.22s -> 17977.34s]  It says to the German commander.
[17977.34s -> 17977.74s]  Nuts.
[17977.74s -> 17978.78s]  The American commander.
[17980.22s -> 17982.10s]  That's nuts, right?
[17983.30s -> 17984.66s]  I love you and all you do for this community.
[17984.66s -> 17987.22s]  But I wanted to ask, is voice acting something you still want to pursue?
[17987.22s -> 17988.82s]  Pursue with your little career.
[17996.09s -> 17997.29s]  My little career?
[18000.58s -> 18003.69s]  I think they...
[18003.69s -> 18007.21s]  I don't think they meant that in a negative way, by the way.
[18007.21s -> 18009.85s]  I've only been in like three or four different productions.
[18009.85s -> 18010.73s]  I think that's what they mean.
[18012.33s -> 18015.21s]  Not like, you're like, hey, dude, your career sucks.
[18016.78s -> 18017.66s]  It was pretty short.
[18017.66s -> 18019.18s]  Yeah, I don't think that's what they mean by that.
[18020.94s -> 18022.14s]  No, this is my focus.
[18024.41s -> 18028.81s]  And I mean, just take a look at the last four days straight.
[18028.81s -> 18029.45s]  Five days straight.
[18029.45s -> 18030.41s]  Like, this is what I do.
[18030.97s -> 18032.49s]  This is my 100% focus.
[18033.77s -> 18038.01s]  This stream, this community, is the priority.
[18038.73s -> 18041.62s]  So it's like, I can't...
[18042.34s -> 18043.29s]  I don't...
[18043.29s -> 18044.09s]  I don't...
[18044.09s -> 18048.25s]  I can't like take time to do auditions and do lines.
[18048.25s -> 18052.09s]  And oh, this script has a viewer character that has 250 lines of dialogue.
[18052.09s -> 18052.59s]  I...
[18053.45s -> 18056.01s]  That's just a ton of time with a director.
[18056.01s -> 18058.49s]  And it's just not something I want to focus on.
[18063.45s -> 18066.73s]  So voice acting is cool.
[18066.73s -> 18067.37s]  It's fun.
[18067.37s -> 18068.73s]  And it's really, really interesting stuff.
[18069.77s -> 18071.61s]  But this is the focus.
[18075.51s -> 18078.23s]  Thanks for your interesting nut message.
[18079.27s -> 18081.19s]  I do appreciate the fact that this time you did not...
[18081.83s -> 18083.59s]  You did not spam a bunch of codes.
[18084.31s -> 18085.51s]  So thank you for that.
[18085.51s -> 18087.03s]  And thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[18092.57s -> 18094.89s]  He hates voice acting.
[18094.89s -> 18097.83s]  I want to get onto the roof of the Big Sur hotel.
[18123.53s -> 18124.03s]  Okay.
[18124.81s -> 18125.31s]  Now...
[18125.69s -> 18126.19s]  Now where?
[18126.97s -> 18128.80s]  Over...
[18129.76s -> 18132.00s]  Uh, can I go up?
[18133.08s -> 18134.68s]  Wait, oh god, I gotta get up here.
[18135.72s -> 18145.85s]  Would I ever act in a movie?
[18147.56s -> 18148.60s]  Oh, that's...
[18148.60s -> 18149.88s]  Sorry, wasn't paying attention.
[18151.16s -> 18151.66s]  Uh...
[18152.52s -> 18153.02s]  Yes.
[18156.67s -> 18157.23s]  Yes, I would.
[18157.87s -> 18165.90s]  It'd be a lot of fun.
[18165.90s -> 18170.52s]  Would you act in Spider-Man?
[18171.56s -> 18172.44s]  As, um...
[18172.44s -> 18173.56s]  As what character do you...
[18173.56s -> 18174.36s]  What character do you think?
[18175.32s -> 18178.41s]  I think you would be a good green copy.
[18179.45s -> 18190.67s]  Eric, I found it.
[18190.67s -> 18192.67s]  Get up here and bring the camera.
[18192.75s -> 18193.79s]  As the greedy grinner.
[18194.75s -> 18200.01s]  Can you believe this spot?
[18200.73s -> 18204.73s]  We're about to film somebody die on camera.
[18209.52s -> 18210.72s]  You serious?
[18210.72s -> 18211.60s]  You'll miss your ollie.
[18211.60s -> 18214.32s]  We'll be sending you back to Jersey in a coffee can.
[18214.32s -> 18215.84s]  Todd said he wanted something big.
[18216.40s -> 18217.36s]  This is it.
[18217.36s -> 18218.88s]  Todd said he wanted something big, man.
[18218.88s -> 18220.32s]  I'm gonna jump off of a building.
[18221.20s -> 18223.04s]  Without any safety equipment.
[18232.89s -> 18233.93s]  Now that you're up here,
[18233.93s -> 18236.89s]  why don't you try to gap to the top of the wavy roof hotel over there?
[18240.76s -> 18243.16s]  Get specials in Gap the Wavy Roof Hotel.
[18244.12s -> 18246.32s]  If I can do that.
[18246.32s -> 18253.64s]  Okay, specials.
[18253.64s -> 18254.20s]  Now, which...
[18254.20s -> 18255.08s]  Where does it want me to go?
[18256.20s -> 18256.68s]  This way.
[18257.80s -> 18258.86s]  Let's gap it.
[18259.74s -> 18260.38s]  Here we go.
[18261.34s -> 18262.46s]  What kind of special should I do?
[18268.19s -> 18277.24s]  I don't have enough...
[18277.80s -> 18278.68s]  I'm gonna get more of this.
[18279.40s -> 18279.90s]  Hold on.
[18280.96s -> 18281.46s]  Oops.
[18282.08s -> 18287.72s]  Gap the Wavy Roof Hotel.
[18289.16s -> 18292.44s]  Okay.
[18292.44s -> 18293.72s]  So, how am I gonna do this?
[18310.73s -> 18312.09s]  Holy shit!
[18312.49s -> 18313.45s]  There you go, man.
[18313.45s -> 18314.89s]  Forget the pink hotel.
[18314.89s -> 18317.61s]  Look, I'll shoot you getting a high score up here on the rooftop
[18317.61s -> 18318.49s]  and we'll call it a day.
[18319.37s -> 18320.81s]  Imagine getting that on camera.
[18324.60s -> 18328.04s]  You could live off the ad revenue from that video for the rest of your life.
[18331.23s -> 18332.75s]  That would get a hundred...
[18332.75s -> 18333.31s]  That would get...
[18333.31s -> 18335.39s]  That would get a million views a day.
[18335.39s -> 18335.89s]  Forever.
[18340.49s -> 18342.41s]  Get 50,000 coins on the roof.
[18342.41s -> 18342.91s]  Easy.
[18347.76s -> 18349.36s]  That was pretty cool, but I didn't know how to land it.
[18350.24s -> 18360.64s]  Again.
[18361.34s -> 18361.84s]  Oh!
[18372.40s -> 18372.90s]  No!
[18373.44s -> 18375.33s]  Sorry.
[18382.60s -> 18383.10s]  Fuck.
[18392.14s -> 18393.90s]  That was 44,000!
[18415.34s -> 18420.49s]  Spine transfer over this quarter pipe to the street below with a big spin.
[18425.21s -> 18425.71s]  I can do that.
[18426.57s -> 18427.07s]  Yeah!
[18448.38s -> 18448.94s]  Dude!
[18448.94s -> 18450.30s]  That was a spinning T-pose.
[18450.30s -> 18450.86s]  That was sick.
[18452.06s -> 18458.11s]  Vilemi just gave 5,000 bits.
[18458.11s -> 18459.23s]  Thanks for the $50 Vilemi.
[18459.87s -> 18460.75s]  Jeremiah just tuned in.
[18460.75s -> 18462.51s]  Why does your character look like Ron Weasley?
[18463.31s -> 18466.33s]  Thanks for the 50 fucking bucks Vilemi.
[18468.09s -> 18468.83s]  Because.
[18469.29s -> 18470.25s]  Because he just jumped.
[18479.50s -> 18480.54s]  A Mick Twist?
[18481.42s -> 18485.84s]  Get Special and do a Mick Twist over the helicopter.
[18493.10s -> 18494.86s]  Special and then Mick Twist.
[18494.86s -> 18495.74s]  Where's the helicopter?
[18518.94s -> 18520.94s]  I want to see how many times I can do it.
[18522.91s -> 18533.87s]  Here we go.
[18533.87s -> 18534.59s]  Mick Twist!
[18544.43s -> 18545.71s]  Oh, I can't even, man.
[18545.71s -> 18546.91s]  It's so stupid.
[18546.91s -> 18548.51s]  It's like not even...
[18548.51s -> 18548.91s]  Is that...
[18548.91s -> 18549.41s]  Oh.
[18549.95s -> 18550.67s]  Whatever.
[18550.67s -> 18551.17s]  Let's go.
[18565.16s -> 18567.08s]  That's just panic in the air.
[18570.92s -> 18571.40s]  Here we go!
[18571.40s -> 18572.52s]  I'm gonna do it!
[18572.52s -> 18572.84s]  Yeah!
[18572.84s -> 18573.72s]  You filming, man?
[18573.72s -> 18574.44s]  There we go!
[18574.44s -> 18574.94s]  Jump!
[18575.24s -> 18576.20s]  Oh my fucking God!
[18576.20s -> 18579.72s]  That's just flailing panic in the air without even a second thought.
[18580.68s -> 18585.37s]  You deleted it.
[18588.40s -> 18588.90s]  Oh.
[18593.08s -> 18595.00s]  Here's the 411 on Vancouver.
[18595.00s -> 18597.72s]  We got our video premiere all set up.
[18597.72s -> 18598.76s]  One problem.
[18598.76s -> 18600.84s]  We don't have a freaking video!
[18600.84s -> 18602.76s]  If your footage ain't done, get it.
[18602.76s -> 18605.56s]  And if it is done, help set up for the big event.
[18605.56s -> 18606.28s]  Got it?
[18606.28s -> 18606.78s]  Okay.
[18608.44s -> 18609.16s]  Sorry, Dad.
[18615.16s -> 18617.16s]  All right.
[18617.16s -> 18618.20s]  Last minute tasks.
[18618.20s -> 18618.70s]  Here we are.
[18618.70s -> 18624.83s]  I heard you guys have some killer footage cooked up for this video.
[18624.83s -> 18627.63s]  Something about a massive Hawaii gap or something?
[18628.43s -> 18629.55s]  Well, that was me.
[18629.55s -> 18630.43s]  I cleared that air.
[18632.11s -> 18633.07s]  No way!
[18633.07s -> 18634.11s]  You're not even a pro!
[18635.07s -> 18635.71s]  Yes, I am.
[18637.84s -> 18638.32s]  Goiki!
[18638.32s -> 18640.16s]  Thanks for the $50, Goiki.
[18640.72s -> 18642.56s]  5,000 bits from Goiki.
[18643.28s -> 18644.14s]  Appreciate it.
[18644.70s -> 18647.90s]  Jerma, if you won't become a voice actor, can you become a ska artist?
[18650.10s -> 18650.60s]  Ska?
[18652.22s -> 18652.72s]  Um...
[18654.98s -> 18656.02s]  Doesn't matter.
[18656.02s -> 18657.78s]  Just go with the premiere tonight and you'll see.
[18661.76s -> 18663.92s]  Uh, I mean, that's like the genre of music, isn't it?
[18666.12s -> 18667.32s]  Wouldn't miss it.
[18667.32s -> 18670.68s]  Hey, since we're here, why don't you let me shoot a little footage of you?
[18672.47s -> 18673.43s]  50,000 points.
[18675.11s -> 18679.57s]  You keepin' up?
[18692.24s -> 18693.12s]  Oh, and I landed it.
[18694.08s -> 18697.01s]  I hate that trick so much.
[18697.81s -> 18699.91s]  Okay, stop.
[18700.87s -> 18720.68s]  What?
[18721.14s -> 18728.98s]  22,000.
[18730.24s -> 18733.22s]  It's a laggy level.
[18737.49s -> 18737.97s]  Why did I do that?
[18737.97s -> 18739.09s]  I was waiting to do a revert.
[18739.09s -> 18739.57s]  Restart?
[18739.57s -> 18740.07s]  No.
[18740.69s -> 18750.60s]  It's been gone.
[18750.60s -> 18752.85s]  Oh, laggy Lenny.
[18753.57s -> 18758.07s]  What else we got here?
[18765.96s -> 18766.76s]  50 FPS.
[18767.64s -> 18771.32s]  I will say, let's be completely honest to the Xbox 360.
[18772.52s -> 18773.02s]  This?
[18773.24s -> 18773.88s]  That guy got a gun?
[18774.84s -> 18777.84s]  Okay, I thought he had a gun.
[18777.84s -> 18778.34s]  Um...
[18781.12s -> 18782.24s]  This looks really good.
[18782.88s -> 18785.12s]  Remember, this is an original Xbox game.
[18785.84s -> 18787.75s]  It's the original Xbox disc.
[18788.71s -> 18792.10s]  This looks actually pretty good for being an original Xbox.
[18792.74s -> 18793.24s]  Upscaled.
[18795.68s -> 18797.38s]  What the heck is that?
[18801.70s -> 18803.54s]  That's a leaf blower cart.
[18803.54s -> 18805.62s]  I use it to clean up these plazas.
[18805.62s -> 18808.90s]  I'll let you try it out, but you've gotta do my work for me.
[18808.90s -> 18811.30s]  I'm not even sure, this game I think is like 480p.
[18812.26s -> 18814.18s]  Or maybe even like something like that.
[18814.18s -> 18816.34s]  There was no HD on the original Xbox.
[18817.06s -> 18817.94s]  No, wait, not even close.
[18819.22s -> 18823.03s]  Was this 720 on the Xbox?
[18823.83s -> 18825.30s]  It's probably 480, wasn't it?
[18837.40s -> 18839.00s]  Leaf Blow Company.
[18839.00s -> 18841.51s]  Loud as fuck.
[18855.57s -> 18857.73s]  PlayStation 2 was the...
[18857.73s -> 18858.23s]  No.
[18859.72s -> 18861.80s]  The PS2 was not capable of 720?
[18863.89s -> 18865.09s]  I do not remember that.
[18871.67s -> 18872.39s]  No, no way.
[18872.95s -> 18881.30s]  PS2 could do 1080i.
[18883.84s -> 18884.34s]  I...
[18885.24s -> 18885.74s]  I...
[18886.20s -> 18886.92s]  I have...
[18886.92s -> 18888.60s]  Going to have to say I do not believe you.
[18889.56s -> 18901.18s]  Come on.
[18901.56s -> 18907.00s]  Is that right?
[18907.00s -> 18907.50s]  No, more?
[18908.68s -> 18916.46s]  Broke up.
[18919.24s -> 18919.74s]  Nice.
[18921.22s -> 18921.86s]  That was cute.
[18921.86s -> 18922.36s]  That was fun.
[18923.14s -> 18924.97s]  PS2.
[18924.97s -> 18926.31s]  PS2 had some of the best games.
[18927.11s -> 18933.68s]  I will agree with you there.
[18934.24s -> 18943.38s]  Just want to get air.
[18943.38s -> 18944.90s]  See if I can get some more air points.
[18948.98s -> 18949.48s]  No?
[18949.48s -> 18950.35s]  Oh well.
[18954.15s -> 18955.11s]  Slam City.
[18960.63s -> 18962.15s]  I just turned my mic up a little.
[18962.15s -> 18962.87s]  Better or worse?
[18968.07s -> 18968.47s]  Better?
[18968.47s -> 18968.97s]  Worse?
[18969.91s -> 18971.44s]  Better?
[18971.44s -> 18972.58s]  Better?
[18972.58s -> 18975.57s]  Okay.
[18975.57s -> 18976.07s]  Failed.
[18977.89s -> 18979.01s]  Combo all...
[18979.01s -> 18980.05s]  Combo all of them.
[18980.85s -> 18984.10s]  Oh, this is going to be hard.
[18984.90s -> 19001.75s]  Actually, it wasn't that bad.
[19003.67s -> 19004.47s]  A lot of missions here.
[19005.43s -> 19006.31s]  Turn the music up.
[19018.44s -> 19020.28s]  Please don't ever turn your mic down.
[19029.76s -> 19030.48s]  I'm going to turn it down.
[19031.52s -> 19032.48s]  I'm turning it down right now.
[19040.80s -> 19041.68s]  No, please!
[19041.68s -> 19042.18s]  No!
[19042.80s -> 19047.28s]  All right.
[19047.28s -> 19049.04s]  Hit all the Flatland tricks.
[19049.60s -> 19051.28s]  Got to do manual tricks.
[19051.28s -> 19053.20s]  Oh, these are always a pain in the ass for me.
[19084.31s -> 19086.39s]  I know I don't do them all at once, but I know.
[19086.39s -> 19086.95s]  I know, I know.
[19086.95s -> 19088.63s]  But that's fun for my brain.
[19090.07s -> 19091.99s]  It scratches a niche in my brain to do them all together.
[19093.03s -> 19122.40s]  Truck stand.
[19122.40s -> 19123.12s]  Do a truck stand.
[19124.00s -> 19124.50s]  Y and X.
[19125.36s -> 19129.41s]  Y and X is truck stand.
[19129.41s -> 19129.91s]  What the fuck?
[19134.34s -> 19134.84s]  Y, X.
[19135.54s -> 19136.18s]  Y, X.
[19136.90s -> 19137.40s]  Oh.
[19138.18s -> 19138.68s]  Okay.
[19139.70s -> 19146.66s]  God, these manuals are going to kill me.
[19147.54s -> 19149.86s]  Look at that fucking row that we're going to clear out right now.
[19150.02s -> 19151.14s]  Fucking manual Tetris.
[19155.43s -> 19156.55s]  I have to look at the controller.
[19156.55s -> 19157.05s]  I know.
[19157.67s -> 19160.18s]  You don't understand.
[19163.03s -> 19163.59s]  Truck stand.
[19164.23s -> 19165.59s]  Why would I do a truck stand?
[19165.59s -> 19166.09s]  Y and X.
[19167.11s -> 19168.47s]  Y and X together, man.
[19198.74s -> 19199.70s]  Camera ready.
[19199.70s -> 19201.94s]  Get 5,000 points in a manual combo.
[19202.98s -> 19214.02s]  Oh, I had 29,000 points.
[19229.04s -> 19230.88s]  This guy sucks.
[19232.87s -> 19235.35s]  Whenever somebody says that, I feel like that's how it's being said.
[19236.31s -> 19237.67s]  The sucks part is slowed down.
[19238.47s -> 19239.11s]  This guy.
[19239.11s -> 19240.47s]  This guy sucks.
[19241.19s -> 19245.41s]  Hey, Bob.
[19245.41s -> 19246.13s]  What are you doing?
[19247.43s -> 19247.93s]  Bob?
[19248.39s -> 19250.95s]  I've been working on this new manual for Casper Handstand.
[19250.95s -> 19251.83s]  Want to give it a try?
[19252.79s -> 19256.37s]  Get special and see if you can pull it while hitting my line.
[19257.57s -> 19259.81s]  Get special and see if you can do the Casper Handstand.
[19275.70s -> 19284.00s]  Now hit your line with the Casper Handstand.
[19284.88s -> 19291.56s]  I mean, I did it, but what's your line?
[19292.36s -> 19294.95s]  Got the line right there, man.
[19297.19s -> 19297.69s]  Very slow.
[19298.39s -> 19313.16s]  Wait, is it not a grind?
[19314.68s -> 19316.29s]  Just do it down the stairs.
[19340.98s -> 19341.62s]  Got it.
[19341.62s -> 19352.28s]  Okay, what else is left?
[19352.28s -> 19358.12s]  We have skate, Tom's part, party drags, Ralphie got busted.
[19359.57s -> 19360.37s]  Filming a line.
[19361.72s -> 19362.36s]  Hey, bro.
[19362.36s -> 19364.28s]  I'm about to hit a line through the underground.
[19364.28s -> 19365.40s]  I need to get some footage.
[19365.40s -> 19366.60s]  Can you follow me with the camera?
[19369.00s -> 19375.25s]  Well, you didn't.
[19375.25s -> 19376.05s]  Why are you not moving?
[19392.95s -> 19393.59s]  He's gone.
[19395.22s -> 19396.02s]  Shitty footage.
[19396.02s -> 19397.14s]  What are you guys doing over here?
[19397.14s -> 19398.18s]  Is he busting some fat ones?
[19398.18s -> 19404.07s]  Those missions are so, uh, not good.
[19404.63s -> 19406.55s]  It's just so, those are so bad.
[19407.91s -> 19409.67s]  This game is like a 97.
[19410.47s -> 19411.67s]  But those are so bad.
[19412.47s -> 19413.11s]  It's terrible.
[19414.55s -> 19416.07s]  Okay, how are you guys doing over here?
[19416.07s -> 19417.35s]  Is he busting some fat ones?
[19419.88s -> 19420.60s]  Dude, look at him.
[19420.60s -> 19421.40s]  He can't skate.
[19428.29s -> 19434.84s]  The fool is still drunk from the hotel party
[19434.84s -> 19437.32s]  and I need footage of him to complete this video.
[19437.32s -> 19439.64s]  He was going to bust some Nollies here at the museum.
[19439.64s -> 19440.84s]  Can you fill in for him?
[19440.84s -> 19442.12s]  I won't film your face.
[19443.08s -> 19443.58s]  Okay.
[19444.28s -> 19445.64s]  Record five Nollies.
[19445.64s -> 19447.72s]  Hit L twice to enter Nollie state.
[19449.00s -> 19455.25s]  You broke my fucking leg, buddy.
[19459.30s -> 19461.14s]  L twice to enter Nollie state?
[19461.94s -> 19475.12s]  Get this on fucking camera instead.
[19475.76s -> 19478.00s]  That's like way cooler.
[19487.24s -> 19489.72s]  Um, I don't understand what to do.
[19489.72s -> 19491.16s]  Record five Nollies.
[19491.16s -> 19493.64s]  Hit L twice to enter Nollie state.
[19494.28s -> 19499.20s]  Oh, fuck.
[19499.20s -> 19499.70s]  Okay.
[19499.70s -> 19500.72s]  Switch pressure.
[19500.72s -> 19501.22s]  Bakey?
[19503.72s -> 19504.60s]  Bakey Ollie.
[19505.57s -> 19506.13s]  Pressure.
[19506.13s -> 19506.63s]  Okay.
[19507.01s -> 19507.81s]  Switch pressure.
[19513.70s -> 19514.42s]  Nollie.
[19514.42s -> 19515.14s]  Nollie.
[19515.14s -> 19515.86s]  Nollie.
[19515.86s -> 19516.58s]  Nollie.
[19516.58s -> 19517.22s]  Nollie.
[19517.22s -> 19518.02s]  Nollie.
[19518.02s -> 19518.58s]  Nollie.
[19518.58s -> 19519.08s]  Nollie.
[19519.62s -> 19520.12s]  Nollie.
[19523.67s -> 19524.17s]  Nollie.
[19525.99s -> 19526.49s]  Nollie.
[19528.20s -> 19528.70s]  Nollie.
[19529.16s -> 19529.80s]  What am I doing?
[19540.21s -> 19541.25s]  Don't do drugs.
[19543.84s -> 19545.20s]  Oh, awesome.
[19545.20s -> 19546.88s]  You better stop landing those Nollies
[19546.88s -> 19549.28s]  so cleanly or no one will believe it's Tom.
[19549.28s -> 19550.56s]  Drunk bastard.
[19550.56s -> 19552.72s]  Anyhow, cruise over here and bust some pressure flips
[19552.72s -> 19554.00s]  and we should be good to go.
[19554.00s -> 19554.80s]  Pressure flips.
[19555.76s -> 19570.02s]  I don't know much about, like, skating.
[19570.58s -> 19572.42s]  So what's the difference between this and a Nollie?
[19572.42s -> 19572.82s]  Thanks.
[19572.82s -> 19574.50s]  That will make perfect filler.
[19574.50s -> 19575.62s]  Okay, one more part.
[19575.62s -> 19577.62s]  You skate this plaza and I'll film combos
[19577.62s -> 19579.30s]  starting with Nollies or pressure flips.
[19579.30s -> 19581.54s]  We'll need some serious points for some good footage.
[19582.26s -> 19583.54s]  Nollie is off the front of the board.
[19585.94s -> 19586.26s]  Okay.
[19586.26s -> 19589.54s]  Record 25,000 points incorporating Nollies and pressures.
[19589.54s -> 19590.04s]  Sure.
[19590.58s -> 19602.31s]  Alright, let's get a Nollie in here.
[19604.53s -> 19606.13s]  Bakey, switch, pressure.
[19606.13s -> 19606.77s]  Pressure.
[19606.77s -> 19607.89s]  Bakey, switch, pressure.
[19614.13s -> 19614.63s]  Nollie.
[19623.08s -> 19624.76s]  A lot of good ball jokes this stream.
[19624.76s -> 19625.26s]  Yeah.
[19626.20s -> 19627.72s]  There's been a lot of good ball jokes here, right?
[19628.60s -> 19634.15s]  That wasn't one.
[19635.11s -> 19637.81s]  I know a ton of you guys are just on the edge of your seat right there.
[19639.01s -> 19651.99s]  By the way, did anybody just open the screen for the first time?
[19652.71s -> 19653.84s]  Just curious.
[19654.48s -> 19659.40s]  Hello.
[19659.40s -> 19663.80s]  If you have, welcome.
[19664.28s -> 19665.40s]  My name's German985.
[19665.40s -> 19666.36s]  I'm playing Tony Hawk.
[19667.00s -> 19668.45s]  You might think it looks a little different.
[19668.45s -> 19669.01s]  It's underground.
[19669.01s -> 19670.05s]  It's not a numbered one.
[19670.93s -> 19671.65s]  Thanks for the follow.
[19672.21s -> 19673.14s]  Appreciate that.
[19674.02s -> 19676.44s]  Welcome to the stream.
[19676.44s -> 19676.94s]  Welcome.
[19679.25s -> 19685.56s]  What's going on?
[19685.56s -> 19691.28s]  The cops nabbed me when I bailed in the museum plaza.
[19691.28s -> 19692.56s]  Couldn't find my passport.
[19694.18s -> 19694.90s]  Make another one?
[19694.90s -> 19695.46s]  Yeah, I will.
[19695.46s -> 19696.18s]  Hold on.
[19696.18s -> 19696.90s]  Where'd you bail?
[19703.48s -> 19704.84s]  You gotta find the gardener.
[19704.84s -> 19705.40s]  Maybe he found it.
[19705.40s -> 19706.20s]  Where'd you bail?
[19707.24s -> 19709.00s]  Find the leaf blower guy.
[19709.96s -> 19713.30s]  All right, you know, is he in the hotel?
[19720.20s -> 19720.68s]  Right here.
[19721.94s -> 19722.66s]  Passport.
[19722.66s -> 19726.98s]  Well, I haven't seen it, but there are quite a few leaf piles around here.
[19726.98s -> 19730.50s]  If you want to search them all quickly, you can use the leaf blower cart.
[19737.28s -> 19738.40s]  55 seconds.
[19741.70s -> 19742.58s]  They're all right here.
[19742.58s -> 19747.20s]  One, two, three, four.
[19747.20s -> 19747.92s]  They're all right here.
[19747.92s -> 19760.21s]  I got one up top with a six one.
[19761.64s -> 19762.92s]  No, Jeremy.
[19764.88s -> 19766.00s]  There's one right here.
[19766.00s -> 19767.44s]  Okay, I got a line.
[19768.48s -> 19781.78s]  This dropped my full plate of dinner on the ground in front of my mother.
[19782.74s -> 19787.38s]  Where is it?
[19788.34s -> 19788.82s]  Huh?
[19788.82s -> 19789.22s]  Guys?
[19793.33s -> 19794.93s]  I thought it was further down.
[19794.93s -> 19795.25s]  Fuck.
[19805.19s -> 19807.51s]  My mother made an entire false spread of food.
[19808.63s -> 19811.19s]  And I dropped all of it on the floor.
[19811.19s -> 19814.52s]  Potentially a new floor, new carpet or something.
[19815.24s -> 19819.68s]  Just like, no, Jeremy, what are you doing?
[19819.68s -> 19820.32s]  It's okay.
[19820.32s -> 19820.88s]  It's all right.
[19821.84s -> 19822.40s]  It's okay.
[19824.04s -> 19824.28s]  Yes.
[19825.48s -> 19829.46s]  Just go.
[19830.66s -> 19832.02s]  It's all right.
[19833.22s -> 19833.70s]  It's all right.
[19833.70s -> 19837.20s]  Just grab some towels.
[19837.92s -> 19843.01s]  Expensive floor.
[19843.89s -> 19854.07s]  Please be more careful next time.
[19854.71s -> 19856.13s]  I'm sorry, Bob.
[19856.77s -> 19857.25s]  It's okay.
[19858.13s -> 19861.76s]  I'm in a towel ladder.
[19872.05s -> 19873.73s]  I would be in a lot of trouble by now.
[19894.80s -> 19895.20s]  Wow.
[19899.27s -> 19899.59s]  Fuck.
[19899.59s -> 19900.71s]  It's so hard to control.
[19901.67s -> 19901.99s]  All right.
[19901.99s -> 19902.55s]  Now, go.
[19903.35s -> 19908.26s]  Pitchy face.
[19908.82s -> 19910.39s]  Okay.
[19934.15s -> 19935.75s]  Tonight's my night.
[19946.31s -> 19946.79s]  Thanks, man.
[19948.31s -> 19949.51s]  Get everyone to the premiere.
[19950.63s -> 19951.17s]  What?
[19952.13s -> 19955.11s]  Why does the camera just swing?
[19955.75s -> 19970.71s]  These are all of our friends.
[19974.04s -> 19975.00s]  Why'd it happen to the color?
[19975.00s -> 19975.32s]  Yeah.
[19975.32s -> 19976.20s]  Why is the color on?
[19976.92s -> 19985.84s]  Did it go down here?
[19986.80s -> 19987.36s]  That's weird.
[19988.48s -> 19989.97s]  Get everybody to the premiere.
[19991.36s -> 19992.08s]  Come on.
[19992.08s -> 19992.32s]  Quick.
[19993.04s -> 20009.76s]  We have this many friends?
[20010.72s -> 20011.92s]  His neck was backwards.
[20011.92s -> 20013.28s]  I guess his head was on backwards.
[20014.00s -> 20033.56s]  He made it.
[20033.56s -> 20033.80s]  All right.
[20033.80s -> 20034.28s]  Let's see.
[20034.28s -> 20037.08s]  Let's take a look at my skiing footage.
[20037.08s -> 20049.01s]  This game is so shit.
[20049.01s -> 20049.89s]  Laughing my ass off.
[20049.89s -> 20052.61s]  What a funny pretend comment that is.
[20053.17s -> 20053.73s]  Hard.
[20053.73s -> 20054.77s]  You weren't even in it.
[20054.77s -> 20058.68s]  But Eric's gets rooftop gap I've ever seen.
[20058.68s -> 20060.44s]  Eric edited his face on my footage.
[20060.44s -> 20064.24s]  Forty stones.
[20064.24s -> 20065.92s]  My trick in my spot.
[20069.72s -> 20073.32s]  To introduce our newest pro, Eric's.
[20073.32s -> 20077.06s]  Eric.
[20077.06s -> 20077.86s]  Editing his face.
[20077.86s -> 20078.90s]  Eric's on his way to the last gap.
[20078.90s -> 20083.72s]  And his first pro board will become two months.
[20083.72s -> 20084.36s]  Hey, Eric.
[20084.36s -> 20086.28s]  Do that trick that you did off the roof again.
[20086.28s -> 20086.92s]  That's what I would do.
[20087.48s -> 20089.16s]  You poached my shots.
[20089.16s -> 20090.12s]  Where's my footage?
[20090.92s -> 20091.56s]  Oh, man.
[20091.56s -> 20092.28s]  I put them on the spot.
[20092.28s -> 20093.96s]  I told myself to tell you, see.
[20093.96s -> 20095.64s]  There was this thing at customs.
[20097.80s -> 20100.20s]  Hey, we go way back.
[20100.20s -> 20102.20s]  So I'm going to forget you just did that.
[20103.00s -> 20104.92s]  Now listen, I got three parties to hit.
[20104.92s -> 20108.60s]  But you better go rest up for the amateur contest tomorrow.
[20112.16s -> 20112.66s]  Dick.
[20113.65s -> 20115.65s]  Just need some basic information from you.
[20123.84s -> 20126.48s]  Budget 3D Bible show.
[20126.48s -> 20127.44s]  You're a pro?
[20127.44s -> 20129.12s]  They entered you as an amateur.
[20129.12s -> 20130.16s]  Someone made a mistake.
[20131.12s -> 20135.01s]  Here's my ride.
[20135.01s -> 20144.82s]  Destroy the slam city jam.
[20144.82s -> 20153.97s]  This is a cool park.
[20154.77s -> 20163.75s]  You guys, I think the skate park would make a big return.
[20164.87s -> 20166.29s]  It's getting so hard.
[20167.09s -> 20168.05s]  Who in this kind of shit?
[20168.05s -> 20169.97s]  I mean, obviously, this is like an arcade game.
[20171.09s -> 20172.37s]  But holy shit.
[20173.25s -> 20176.45s]  It takes so much skill to be able to do any of this shit.
[20177.57s -> 20182.61s]  Oh, my God.
[20182.61s -> 20183.65s]  That would have been fucking a lot.
[20184.77s -> 20186.20s]  This isn't real.
[20186.20s -> 20188.52s]  Yeah, but have you ever seen an actual skate video before?
[20189.48s -> 20191.08s]  That shit is insane.
[20194.20s -> 20197.56s]  I had to jump in with a board and sliding down a bar
[20197.56s -> 20200.44s]  and not like fucking instantly dying.
[20202.26s -> 20205.46s]  Like, oh, I'm just going to jump down the 30 flights of stairs on a bar.
[20205.46s -> 20207.14s]  Like, holy shit, that's so scary.
[20208.26s -> 20212.50s]  It takes so much skill, so much patience.
[20213.22s -> 20216.87s]  I'm on the list.
[20217.59s -> 20219.27s]  Destroy the street competition.
[20219.99s -> 20221.43s]  My best.
[20239.08s -> 20240.44s]  Should we show them up our special move?
[20240.44s -> 20241.96s]  OK, I got to incorporate my special move.
[20276.55s -> 20279.35s]  Oh, that felt nice.
[20279.35s -> 20279.85s]  Damn it.
[20290.74s -> 20291.54s]  I love this game.
[20298.96s -> 20300.72s]  No, Xbox.
[20301.36s -> 20302.00s]  Xbox.
[20302.00s -> 20303.36s]  Why Xbox?
[20303.36s -> 20305.28s]  That was like 180,000 points.
[20305.28s -> 20306.64s]  Xbox, what have you done to me?
[20308.47s -> 20309.51s]  Xbox, what have you done?
[20314.04s -> 20316.44s]  OK, well, I mean, I got I'm in first place.
[20316.44s -> 20317.24s]  Eric Sparrow stuff.
[20318.20s -> 20319.52s]  Let's go.
[20319.52s -> 20320.02s]  Wow.
[20323.51s -> 20347.65s]  No, no, don't do it yet.
[20358.32s -> 20360.42s]  Ooh, don't end it yet.
[20360.42s -> 20367.80s]  No, dude, I just went through it.
[20368.36s -> 20369.80s]  All right, 200,000 should be good.
[20401.44s -> 20405.11s]  Big finish, here we go.
[20407.67s -> 20408.63s]  God damn it.
[20408.63s -> 20409.51s]  Come on, big finish.
[20419.75s -> 20420.92s]  I'm still dumb.
[20421.72s -> 20422.84s]  I can literally do whatever I want.
[20423.80s -> 20425.41s]  I almost have a perfect score.
[20426.13s -> 20434.23s]  Actually, I'm going to go for a monster combo.
[20434.79s -> 20446.07s]  I like this space.
[20446.07s -> 20446.55s]  It's great.
[20457.17s -> 20458.21s]  Are you kidding me?
[20458.21s -> 20459.01s]  What the hell was that?
[20459.89s -> 20470.36s]  You seeing this shit?
[20470.36s -> 20471.56s]  Mom, get the camera.
[20471.56s -> 20500.88s]  Some half-pipe shit.
[20519.27s -> 20519.77s]  It's OK.
[20522.52s -> 20523.88s]  Oh, that was so much fun.
[20524.52s -> 20526.44s]  Just flying around and going like.
[20530.12s -> 20531.62s]  I love it.
[20531.62s -> 20563.91s]  It was 133,000 to get some practice in hip transfer these ramps by skating up the first
[20563.91s -> 20567.19s]  quarter pipe at an angle and cutting the corner in the game is so good.
[20567.19s -> 20568.39s]  It's always up to.
[20568.39s -> 20573.92s]  Yeah, it was hip hip transfer these ramps by skating up the first quarter pipe at an
[20573.92s -> 20575.68s]  angle and then cutting the corner in the air.
[20575.68s -> 20579.12s]  After you jump at an angle, press this hip transfer to the other side.
[20580.64s -> 20582.44s]  Watch this guy.
[20583.24s -> 20586.26s]  He's not very good.
[20593.67s -> 20602.44s]  Oh, again, the same hip transfer first, then continue on to the second.
[20602.44s -> 20603.48s]  Who hip transfers?
[20605.32s -> 20610.37s]  I mean, that was fucking awesome.
[20610.37s -> 20611.73s]  Way better than what you wanted me to do.
[20624.31s -> 20642.36s]  All right, let's do some more stuff.
[20643.16s -> 20647.70s]  How does it never get old?
[20647.70s -> 20648.10s]  I don't know.
[20648.10s -> 20648.90s]  It just doesn't.
[20648.90s -> 20649.40s]  Weird.
[20650.58s -> 20653.33s]  Any more quests?
[20654.05s -> 20659.46s]  I want to put some new tricks on, too, because these are getting a little stale to me.
[20660.42s -> 20663.16s]  Edit tricks.
[20664.28s -> 20664.92s]  Wrap tricks.
[20664.92s -> 20665.48s]  I want to do.
[20667.48s -> 20668.44s]  Get rid of the melon.
[20668.44s -> 20672.98s]  Let's put on fucking cannonball here to the Indy and let's do the Madonna.
[20674.76s -> 20675.72s]  Get rid of the Japan.
[20675.72s -> 20676.44s]  Let's put on.
[20678.45s -> 20680.93s]  Stale fish instead of Indy Stiffy.
[20680.93s -> 20684.37s]  Let's do a crossbar.
[20684.37s -> 20684.93s]  Let's check it out.
[20699.81s -> 20704.79s]  I got to learn how to see what it was like.
[20704.79s -> 20706.55s]  The actual part here.
[20707.91s -> 20709.76s]  Hard to land.
[20710.88s -> 20712.47s]  Yeah, that's hard to land.
[20720.92s -> 20722.36s]  Oh, whoa.
[20722.36s -> 20722.76s]  Hold on.
[20724.18s -> 20724.82s]  Christ air.
[20728.50s -> 20729.86s]  They're all kind of hard to land.
[20729.86s -> 20742.84s]  That's all right.
[20742.84s -> 20743.88s]  You're killing this guy.
[20744.52s -> 20752.45s]  He'll be fine.
[20752.45s -> 20753.17s]  Christ air.
[20753.17s -> 20754.05s]  Fine.
[20768.02s -> 20769.62s]  We're making our own Christ air.
[20769.62s -> 20777.49s]  All right.
[20777.49s -> 20778.21s]  Holdable.
[20778.21s -> 20778.71s]  Yes.
[20801.22s -> 20802.18s]  Just make him a drill.
[20802.74s -> 20804.42s]  No, we can't spin.
[20804.42s -> 20811.27s]  Just turn him into a helicopter.
[20812.31s -> 20814.47s]  I'm it's going to be another spin joke.
[20814.47s -> 20815.91s]  That's going to be fucking great.
[20839.86s -> 20840.18s]  All right.
[20840.18s -> 20856.44s]  That's good.
[20856.44s -> 20876.80s]  Somebody said just do Christ air,
[20876.80s -> 20878.00s]  but just add a fart to it.
[20880.76s -> 20882.52s]  Imagine if I actually did something like that.
[20884.12s -> 20884.52s]  That's it.
[20884.52s -> 20885.56s]  That's the only change.
[20889.97s -> 20890.45s]  What is it?
[20891.81s -> 20892.61s]  There's a toy.
[20895.59s -> 20897.91s]  There's a toy that you pull a little string
[20897.91s -> 20900.71s]  and it like spins and it's like a flower that opens up.
[20901.35s -> 20905.40s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[20907.08s -> 20909.32s]  It's like a little it's like a cheap little toy
[20909.32s -> 20913.40s]  that just like you can like open it up, open it up, open it up.
[20913.40s -> 20914.20s]  What are those things called?
[20915.08s -> 20921.24s]  They're like a dollar.
[20921.24s -> 20928.08s]  Oh, how many can I add?
[20933.09s -> 20934.37s]  That hurts my head actually.
[20943.46s -> 20945.86s]  It's one of those it's a full helicopter.
[20945.86s -> 20997.68s]  Oh, it's too much.
[20997.68s -> 20998.96s]  It needs to be shorter.
[20998.96s -> 21003.20s]  It needs to be shorter by a little bit.
[21011.01s -> 21012.34s]  Imagine holding this.
[21013.22s -> 21023.44s]  I want a quick one.
[21023.44s -> 21024.16s]  No, hold on.
[21025.20s -> 21030.26s]  It's holdable.
[21040.77s -> 21042.21s]  Make it 0.1 second.
[21043.33s -> 21053.73s]  I'm glad you think that was any different.
[21053.73s -> 21054.85s]  It's the same thing.
[21056.05s -> 21056.37s]  Just.
[21064.93s -> 21084.20s]  Okay, back to editor.
[21110.64s -> 21111.12s]  You know what?
[21112.72s -> 21127.56s]  No, no, I've got a better idea.
[21136.72s -> 21138.24s]  I want to be able to do a kickflip
[21138.24s -> 21139.68s]  but just do a backflip.
[21139.68s -> 21141.43s]  You know what I mean?
[21141.43s -> 21142.47s]  Just like, bam.
[21153.43s -> 21160.13s]  Imagine doing a backflip on landing it on a grind.
[21161.09s -> 21165.48s]  See what I mean?
[21169.75s -> 21171.27s]  That's fucking so stupid.
[21171.99s -> 21187.36s]  Here we go.
[21187.36s -> 21195.43s]  One, two, add to cart.
[21196.71s -> 21206.39s]  No, I think I've modded this.
[21206.39s -> 21209.27s]  I mean, like this just feels like it shouldn't ever be in the game.
[21210.07s -> 21220.56s]  It's a literal backflip because it's technically a kickflip.
[21221.36s -> 21233.30s]  Imagine not getting an actual 10 out of 10 for doing this.
[21258.88s -> 21259.36s]  Jesus.
[21260.93s -> 21261.57s]  All right, we're good.
[21267.78s -> 21272.26s]  It's called one, one B, one back.
[21272.26s -> 21275.16s]  No, one back.
[21275.88s -> 21276.36s]  Back one.
[21288.07s -> 21288.55s]  Back one.
[21288.55s -> 21289.19s]  That's what it is.
[21293.32s -> 21294.71s]  Boring.
[21294.71s -> 21296.47s]  It means to invent a funny name.
[21297.99s -> 21299.11s]  It's a backflip.
[21299.11s -> 21299.51s]  That's it.
[21300.87s -> 21303.06s]  What do you want me to call it?
[21303.06s -> 21304.90s]  Oh, the scoopity poopity.
[21304.90s -> 21306.18s]  It's a backflip.
[21306.18s -> 21306.58s]  That's it.
[21308.40s -> 21309.52s]  It's just a backflip.
[21309.52s -> 21319.36s]  Backspace.
[21319.36s -> 21320.68s]  I like backspace.
[21338.12s -> 21340.08s]  Capitalize the flip.
[21344.76s -> 21346.84s]  Okay, let's get out of here.
[21347.64s -> 21350.28s]  Edit tricks, flip tricks.
[21351.00s -> 21352.20s]  Here we go.
[21352.20s -> 21356.04s]  I'm going to put it on to this hard flip here.
[21365.54s -> 21384.40s]  You unsubbed because no scoopity poopity.
[21384.40s -> 21385.36s]  I'm so sorry.
[21386.88s -> 21388.47s]  All right, blimp.
[21390.10s -> 21391.70s]  Crazy ass fans.
[21391.70s -> 21394.18s]  Competition won't start until they're removed from the lights.
[21398.71s -> 21400.15s]  Fans are on the lights.
[21400.15s -> 21401.19s]  I have to use a blimp.
[21402.15s -> 21411.76s]  I'm killing it.
[21412.96s -> 21415.00s]  Blimp controls.
[21415.96s -> 21416.52s]  Celebrate.
[21417.32s -> 21419.11s]  How do I go up?
[21419.91s -> 21424.76s]  I don't think I can move it.
[21424.76s -> 21425.96s]  I think I can just go left and right.
[21427.00s -> 21462.60s]  Go up.
[21462.60s -> 21464.04s]  I just hit an invisible wall.
[21465.16s -> 21466.28s]  What is that, gang?
[21467.16s -> 21467.48s]  Come on.
[21467.48s -> 21469.08s]  You're supposed to be in 97 stuff.
[21489.41s -> 21489.81s]  Oh, yeah.
[21492.56s -> 21493.04s]  These balls.
[21494.00s -> 21498.72s]  Wow.
[21499.52s -> 21506.56s]  Oh, look at that.
[21508.96s -> 21509.60s]  So good.
[21510.24s -> 21510.96s]  So good.
[21511.76s -> 21515.46s]  Just standard jumps and standard kickflips.
[21519.22s -> 21519.54s]  Safe.
[21521.09s -> 21521.97s]  Nice, but safe.
[21522.53s -> 21527.52s]  Okay.
[21527.52s -> 21529.96s]  When are you going to be done?
[21529.96s -> 21534.23s]  He's actually pretty impressive.
[21534.23s -> 21534.87s]  He's still going.
[21537.35s -> 21539.11s]  He's still got this combo going.
[21539.83s -> 21541.27s]  I'm actually a little concerned now.
[21541.27s -> 21543.03s]  I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[21544.08s -> 21546.88s]  This is like five laps on the course.
[21547.92s -> 21548.84s]  There's A.
[21550.28s -> 21550.84s]  Oh, shit.
[21562.40s -> 21562.72s]  Find it.
[21579.49s -> 21579.81s]  Okay.
[21579.81s -> 21583.67s]  It's actually a little distracting.
[21583.67s -> 21584.79s]  I don't know if I like this.
[21585.35s -> 21615.73s]  I would take it off.
[21615.73s -> 21616.93s]  I don't like it.
[21621.76s -> 21624.80s]  It's super distracting and it's hard.
[21624.80s -> 21625.36s]  It's very...
[21625.92s -> 21627.84s]  It's kind of ruining my runs.
[21628.48s -> 21629.12s]  I can't take it off.
[21673.43s -> 21674.31s]  No, get it off.
[21674.31s -> 21674.79s]  Get it off.
[21674.79s -> 21675.35s]  Get it off.
[21675.35s -> 21675.99s]  Get it off.
[21675.99s -> 21676.47s]  Get it off.
[21676.47s -> 21677.51s]  I can't stand it.
[21677.51s -> 21679.72s]  It's too fucked up.
[21679.72s -> 21680.92s]  Get it off.
[21680.92s -> 21685.38s]  Put anything else.
[21685.38s -> 21686.50s]  I don't care what it is.
[21686.50s -> 21687.14s]  Get it off.
[21687.14s -> 21688.26s]  I don't want to see it anymore.
[21689.33s -> 21690.85s]  It's not going to happen.
[21690.85s -> 21694.71s]  We'll just do a varial heel flip there.
[21694.71s -> 21695.83s]  That sounds like a good one.
[21698.87s -> 21699.51s]  You know what I mean?
[21699.51s -> 21700.55s]  Like it's not...
[21700.55s -> 21702.39s]  My whole body isn't moving around.
[21704.07s -> 21713.04s]  Fuck you.
[21713.04s -> 21713.52s]  I had that.
[21713.52s -> 21743.51s]  Fuck off, Eric.
[21743.51s -> 21745.19s]  How's that fucking taste, Eric?
[21776.66s -> 21777.62s]  I'm a pro now.
[21777.70s -> 21789.68s]  Did he say bovine balls?
[21790.64s -> 21800.42s]  Create a deck.
[21800.42s -> 21801.14s]  Now that you're a pro,
[21801.14s -> 21803.70s]  you'll need to design your own pro deck graphic.
[21807.40s -> 21808.20s]  Base graphic.
[21809.00s -> 21845.19s]  No, the bricks.
[21845.19s -> 21865.28s]  Bricks.
[21865.28s -> 21880.76s]  Rock?
[21895.35s -> 21936.37s]  Really?
[21941.27s -> 21953.24s]  What?
[21953.24s -> 21953.80s]  Oh, no.
[21954.36s -> 21955.24s]  I can only have one of these?
[21967.22s -> 21967.62s]  Move it.
[21968.18s -> 21968.66s]  Here we go.
[21968.66s -> 21975.64s]  Okay, looks good.
[21977.00s -> 21978.39s]  Okay.
[21978.95s -> 21979.43s]  Another one.
[21981.51s -> 21987.12s]  I can only...
[21987.12s -> 21988.00s]  I can only have one.
[22001.14s -> 22001.70s]  Layer three.
[22001.70s -> 22009.46s]  Okay, great.
[22009.46s -> 22011.22s]  I could use four slot emotes.
[22021.41s -> 22043.54s]  Oh, well.
[22044.92s -> 22045.64s]  All right, I'm going to do...
[22048.92s -> 22049.80s]  I don't like any of these.
[22049.80s -> 22057.76s]  Maybe the fire?
[22058.48s -> 22075.28s]  I don't really want anything.
[22076.40s -> 22077.52s]  No, I don't want any graphics.
[22079.36s -> 22085.52s]  No graphics.
[22085.52s -> 22086.48s]  Layer two.
[22086.48s -> 22086.72s]  Layer...
[22087.36s -> 22088.24s]  Layer one.
[22088.24s -> 22088.88s]  Layer two.
[22088.88s -> 22089.36s]  Layer one.
[22090.32s -> 22095.52s]  Let's try this one more time.
[22095.52s -> 22096.16s]  There we go.
[22100.32s -> 22105.25s]  Like that.
[22105.25s -> 22106.21s]  Looks fucking good, dude.
[22110.68s -> 22111.08s]  All right.
[22112.12s -> 22119.22s]  The pizza stain board.
[22120.42s -> 22121.38s]  That board sucks.
[22121.38s -> 22121.94s]  No, it doesn't.
[22121.94s -> 22124.90s]  Hey, way to clean up in the slam city gym.
[22124.90s -> 22126.66s]  Heard you scored a pro model, too.
[22127.94s -> 22130.29s]  Well, I would have scored it sooner if Eric had...
[22130.29s -> 22130.69s]  It's brick.
[22130.69s -> 22132.77s]  It's brick with blood and stuff.
[22132.77s -> 22133.25s]  It looks like...
[22138.95s -> 22139.67s]  Pizza board.
[22139.67s -> 22143.32s]  You're just jealous Eric gets to go to Moscow instead of you.
[22143.96s -> 22146.92s]  I got more important things to worry about than Eric.
[22146.92s -> 22150.28s]  Like maybe you could help me shop for a house.
[22150.28s -> 22152.69s]  Nice work, guys.
[22152.69s -> 22154.13s]  I'll help you shop for a tent.
[22154.13s -> 22155.01s]  Nice job.
[22155.01s -> 22159.70s]  Look around the air and it'll land on somebody.
[22159.70s -> 22164.42s]  Yeah, but I see Kostin with his crazy Hollywood house and Tony with his Lexus.
[22164.42s -> 22167.14s]  Sponsors, man.
[22167.14s -> 22172.26s]  Even my sister knows that you have to have a signature shoe to make decent living from skating.
[22173.38s -> 22176.61s]  But hey, it looks like the sponsors are all hanging around town.
[22176.61s -> 22178.05s]  Why do they all just walk around town?
[22179.17s -> 22179.65s]  Who knows?
[22179.65s -> 22181.81s]  If you get a shoe deal, maybe they'll take you on tour.
[22181.81s -> 22184.77s]  Just the random NPC sponsors that are just in your city,
[22184.77s -> 22186.53s]  just walking around waiting to give you money.
[22187.41s -> 22195.27s]  Just do a cool trick.
[22195.27s -> 22196.55s]  Does this work for magicians, too?
[22199.49s -> 22199.81s]  Ditch.
[22201.22s -> 22202.42s]  Why can I ditch the car?
[22203.22s -> 22208.85s]  I can't ditch.
[22216.45s -> 22217.33s]  I'm a pro.
[22217.33s -> 22218.05s]  I have a limo.
[22222.21s -> 22223.01s]  Learn to drive.
[22224.04s -> 22225.32s]  Why have they spawned me here?
[22235.20s -> 22236.96s]  Driving your own limo.
[22242.13s -> 22242.69s]  Half pipe.
[22243.33s -> 22245.11s]  Nice trick.
[22246.28s -> 22247.32s]  All right, let's do something.
[22248.77s -> 22249.97s]  Show off your skills.
[22250.77s -> 22254.45s]  We need to see something edgy before we'll give you a shoe.
[22254.45s -> 22255.41s]  Tell you what.
[22255.41s -> 22258.53s]  Let's see you clear all the spines of Superior Court.
[22258.53s -> 22259.97s]  Where are the spines?
[22259.97s -> 22265.49s]  One, two, and three.
[22269.01s -> 22271.64s]  What do you mean by this?
[22273.64s -> 22277.20s]  You mean that counts, right?
[22278.64s -> 22286.55s]  Come on up here.
[22287.51s -> 22309.88s]  Restart.
[22310.52s -> 22310.68s]  No.
[22311.80s -> 22312.76s]  Get off the board and walk.
[22313.48s -> 22318.31s]  All right, come on.
[22324.21s -> 22325.49s]  The shoe guys are into me.
[22325.49s -> 22327.41s]  Todd says I'm on board for the next tour.
[22328.45s -> 22330.05s]  Dude, you're going to miss that bus.
[22331.01s -> 22331.57s]  What bus?
[22332.29s -> 22333.33s]  Your team bus.
[22333.33s -> 22335.09s]  Bro, they're going to Moscow.
[22335.09s -> 22335.49s]  What?
[22335.49s -> 22336.77s]  Oh, damn.
[22336.77s -> 22337.25s]  My shoes.
[22337.25s -> 22338.13s]  My shoes.
[22338.13s -> 22339.01s]  And my socks.
[22339.01s -> 22340.05s]  And my socks.
[22341.17s -> 22341.81s]  Go, dude.
[22343.11s -> 22345.19s]  My shoes and my socks.
[22371.11s -> 22372.71s]  Why am I doing tricks?
[22372.71s -> 22373.35s]  I don't know.
[22373.35s -> 22373.91s]  I don't know.
[22373.91s -> 22374.63s]  I just want to.
[22383.20s -> 22383.60s]  Thanks.
[22385.04s -> 22385.68s]  Son of a.
[22385.68s -> 22386.64s]  There goes my bus.
[22386.64s -> 22387.20s]  Son of a what?
[22388.16s -> 22389.41s]  What?
[22389.41s -> 22389.89s]  I need my.
[22389.89s -> 22391.97s]  No, I need my trophy.
[22392.69s -> 22394.37s]  Get your slam city trophy.
[22395.41s -> 22399.22s]  Excuse me.
[22399.22s -> 22399.54s]  I got to.
[22400.34s -> 22409.19s]  It's the bus, right?
[22413.67s -> 22413.91s]  What?
[22414.55s -> 22426.00s]  Do I have to beat the bus to Moscow?
[22426.00s -> 22429.73s]  Stop that bus.
[22435.43s -> 22435.91s]  I can't get.
[22436.63s -> 22439.00s]  Why didn't they break?
[22439.80s -> 22458.64s]  Oh, I just didn't get to the end.
[22461.24s -> 22462.52s]  I thought stop the bus.
[22462.52s -> 22464.12s]  I'm like, stand in front of it.
[22464.92s -> 22470.24s]  I didn't know that stop the bus meant
[22470.80s -> 22475.20s]  to skate over through the level out of the level.
[22476.96s -> 22478.08s]  Mother Russia.
[22478.08s -> 22482.16s]  Home of borscht, potatoes, and the world's biggest skate demo ever.
[22482.16s -> 22485.44s]  All the press will be here looking for this year's best new pro.
[22485.44s -> 22488.16s]  Now, the demo doesn't start for a few days, OK?
[22488.16s -> 22489.68s]  So stay the hell out of trouble.
[22495.03s -> 22496.63s]  Is this emulated or is it on console?
[22496.63s -> 22498.47s]  This is actually on console.
[22499.43s -> 22505.83s]  This is an Xbox 360 slim with an official Xbox 360 hard drive in it.
[22505.83s -> 22506.71s]  You have to have one of those.
[22506.71s -> 22507.75s]  Don't make the mistake I did.
[22509.51s -> 22512.47s]  And it's just the original disc for Xbox.
[22514.87s -> 22521.38s]  Welcome to Russia.
[22522.34s -> 22525.08s]  Hey, American.
[22526.04s -> 22531.16s]  Some nosy American company installed cameras on our buildings for this contest.
[22532.28s -> 22535.62s]  Cameras.
[22537.06s -> 22540.34s]  We Russians value privacy and would like them knocked out.
[22540.34s -> 22542.10s]  Why don't you do something?
[22542.10s -> 22543.14s]  I do favor for you.
[22545.14s -> 22546.26s]  I knocked on the cameras.
[22548.90s -> 22550.98s]  Don't say that you can't comprehend.
[22550.98s -> 22553.78s]  Don't say that you don't understand.
[22553.78s -> 22554.74s]  This is California.
[22554.74s -> 22560.95s]  I'm not saying that you can't understand.
[22560.95s -> 22563.43s]  Don't say that you can't understand.
[22563.43s -> 22564.31s]  This is California.
[22564.31s -> 22571.09s]  Don't say that you can't comprehend.
[22571.09s -> 22574.79s]  How many are there?
[22583.06s -> 22591.68s]  I guess it's just got to stay on the grind.
[22603.38s -> 22604.34s]  Oh, it's up there.
[22604.34s -> 22604.90s]  Holy shit.
[22606.39s -> 22606.79s]  Damn.
[22606.79s -> 22607.51s]  How do I get up there?
[22613.83s -> 22615.36s]  Is that your wall ride?
[22616.16s -> 22623.75s]  Don't say that you don't understand.
[22623.75s -> 22633.86s]  Don't say that you don't understand.
[22633.86s -> 22641.25s]  That you don't understand.
[22641.25s -> 22641.75s]  Shit.
[22642.77s -> 22648.95s]  There it is.
[22649.73s -> 22650.61s]  But not quite.
[22650.61s -> 22651.65s]  I didn't get the other one below it.
[22652.61s -> 22653.11s]  Wait.
[22654.88s -> 22655.38s]  Did I?
[22656.56s -> 22665.83s]  Okay.
[22665.83s -> 22666.07s]  Yep.
[22666.07s -> 22666.39s]  I see it.
[22666.39s -> 22666.87s]  I see it.
[22666.87s -> 22668.47s]  It's right after that.
[22668.47s -> 22678.58s]  I'm going to go up.
[22679.46s -> 22687.50s]  There it is.
[22688.92s -> 22690.64s]  There's more here.
[22692.56s -> 22693.68s]  I thought that was going to be the end.
[22694.48s -> 22695.36s]  That's not the end.
[22696.64s -> 22697.04s]  Fuck.
[22697.04s -> 22697.76s]  That's not the end.
[22697.76s -> 22698.48s]  I got to keep going.
[22698.48s -> 22699.20s]  It's one line.
[22699.20s -> 22699.84s]  Holy shit.
[22719.59s -> 22722.96s]  Sorry.
[22722.96s -> 22723.28s]  I got to...
[22727.41s -> 22731.68s]  How do I get up from this without...
[22731.68s -> 22732.32s]  Can I just...
[22732.32s -> 22732.82s]  Hold on.
[22734.50s -> 22735.00s]  Fuck.
[22735.62s -> 22737.14s]  Just get off the board and just punch it.
[22739.06s -> 22740.64s]  This one's fucking hard.
[22741.44s -> 22752.49s]  There it is.
[22753.27s -> 22753.77s]  Got it.
[22754.23s -> 22755.04s]  There's more?
[22755.04s -> 22755.54s]  No.
[22755.92s -> 22757.64s]  Okay.
[22757.64s -> 22758.14s]  There we go.
[22762.88s -> 22763.12s]  What?
[22763.12s -> 22763.44s]  Whoa.
[22763.44s -> 22763.92s]  What?
[22763.92s -> 22764.56s]  What?
[22764.56s -> 22764.96s]  Where?
[22764.96s -> 22765.20s]  What?
[22765.20s -> 22766.40s]  Wait.
[22766.40s -> 22767.04s]  What?
[22767.04s -> 22768.24s]  There's another more.
[22768.96s -> 22770.00s]  Didn't it say completed?
[22770.88s -> 22772.47s]  Wait.
[22772.47s -> 22773.43s]  What was the green?
[22774.23s -> 22774.55s]  Oh.
[22774.55s -> 22774.95s]  Okay.
[22774.95s -> 22776.31s]  I saw like the big green green.
[22776.31s -> 22776.71s]  Like, okay.
[22776.71s -> 22777.27s]  And I looked over.
[22777.27s -> 22778.07s]  I was just done.
[22778.07s -> 22784.42s]  I thought that was it.
[22784.42s -> 22784.90s]  I thought...
[22784.90s -> 22786.02s]  I just saw the big green text.
[22786.02s -> 22786.50s]  I'm like, all right.
[22786.50s -> 22787.14s]  There's the line.
[22799.94s -> 22813.16s]  Fucking kidding me.
[22815.25s -> 22815.75s]  What?
[22816.37s -> 22816.93s]  Where is it?
[22821.11s -> 22824.31s]  Holy shit, dude.
[22825.43s -> 22826.47s]  What's the transfer here?
[22832.68s -> 22833.48s]  I don't see the transfer.
[22834.28s -> 22855.54s]  Got it.
[22855.54s -> 22856.26s]  Holy fuck.
[22856.26s -> 22856.76s]  Okay.
[22857.54s -> 22858.76s]  That one was fucking hard.
[22886.60s -> 22887.91s]  Caveman grind?
[22890.60s -> 22892.76s]  Well, I'm going to lose 400 rubles
[22892.76s -> 22894.28s]  because I don't know what a caveman grind is.
[22894.52s -> 22895.48s]  That's a caveman grind.
[22898.72s -> 22899.76s]  Just jumping off?
[22908.55s -> 22909.03s]  Like with a...
[22910.15s -> 22910.63s]  I don't know.
[22910.63s -> 22913.08s]  A caveman is you just don't need to put the board back on.
[22914.04s -> 22914.52s]  Like that.
[22914.52s -> 22915.08s]  Like that.
[22918.71s -> 22921.94s]  I don't know.
[22921.94s -> 22922.18s]  Stop.
[22922.18s -> 22922.74s]  Please.
[22933.30s -> 22934.98s]  Why is this the hardest thing so far?
[22936.10s -> 22936.98s]  Caveman attempt...
[22936.98s -> 22945.12s]  Oh.
[22945.12s -> 22949.28s]  Caveman attempt in a 20,000 point combo.
[22950.69s -> 22952.69s]  They said fuck this mission, by the way.
[22952.69s -> 22953.01s]  Really?
[22954.21s -> 22958.61s]  I...
[22958.61s -> 22958.85s]  What?
[22961.81s -> 22967.68s]  Fuck.
[22970.00s -> 22984.31s]  Fuck.
[22984.31s -> 22984.79s]  Ah.
[22984.79s -> 22985.59s]  My hands are sweating.
[22990.28s -> 22990.60s]  Nope.
[22991.64s -> 22994.74s]  I'm losing all my ruffles.
[22994.74s -> 22995.06s]  I know.
[22996.18s -> 23002.82s]  It's actually very, very hard to control the character when you're...
[23002.82s -> 23005.30s]  Standing on the tank, your movement changes.
[23006.18s -> 23006.98s]  Like I'm holding...
[23007.94s -> 23008.98s]  It's just weird.
[23008.98s -> 23010.10s]  It's almost like the character's...
[23010.10s -> 23011.38s]  See, I'm like holding the buttons down.
[23011.38s -> 23012.42s]  I'm like not running anymore.
[23012.42s -> 23013.14s]  It's kind of odd.
[23013.14s -> 23014.10s]  I'm just walking instead.
[23015.38s -> 23016.74s]  It's weird.
[23018.26s -> 23021.59s]  It's like I'm walking in quicksand right now.
[23022.31s -> 23028.66s]  20,000 points.
[23028.66s -> 23029.14s]  I can do it.
[23030.34s -> 23046.72s]  Fuck.
[23046.72s -> 23046.96s]  All right.
[23046.96s -> 23049.36s]  Now I understand what somebody said when they said fuck this mission.
[23050.24s -> 23051.36s]  Now I get what you're saying.
[23052.08s -> 23063.57s]  Did I get it?
[23066.72s -> 23067.76s]  What about the other one?
[23067.76s -> 23068.80s]  This one here.
[23068.80s -> 23069.84s]  This one's firing.
[23070.72s -> 23077.30s]  Fuck.
[23077.94s -> 23081.14s]  There's a much better line here.
[23082.69s -> 23084.05s]  There's nothing over off that one.
[23094.10s -> 23095.22s]  That was only 15.
[23095.22s -> 23095.54s]  Fuck.
[23110.24s -> 23115.11s]  Damn it.
[23115.67s -> 23117.03s]  I'm starting to become greasy again.
[23117.67s -> 23122.42s]  Can caveman any part of the tank?
[23123.30s -> 23124.26s]  Are you fucking serious?
[23126.39s -> 23128.23s]  Why am I doing the hardest part?
[23131.20s -> 23131.92s]  What?
[23131.92s -> 23132.72s]  No, I can't.
[23133.44s -> 23134.88s]  Oh, come on.
[23134.88s -> 23137.04s]  Why is my brain so strange?
[23137.92s -> 23141.76s]  Oh, I got a caveman up the nose of the tank.
[23141.76s -> 23142.72s]  Oh, my God.
[23143.28s -> 23144.72s]  What a waste of fucking time.
[23147.46s -> 23148.66s]  Good duo combo.
[23182.37s -> 23184.13s]  He's gotta get something going and then run back.
[23184.37s -> 23195.52s]  Because it keeps your combo when you run off like that.
[23199.60s -> 23202.84s]  All right, here we go.
[23206.20s -> 23206.52s]  That's it.
[23208.68s -> 23211.72s]  Why would I caveman first when I can just get off the cater?
[23212.52s -> 23219.33s]  You just have to have done a caveman at some point in the combo.
[23219.33s -> 23222.21s]  So I might as well do the combo first and then just do the caveman
[23222.21s -> 23223.89s]  because it's easier because I can just get off the fucking
[23224.61s -> 23225.01s]  scooter.
[23227.97s -> 23230.93s]  If you're in the middle of a combo and you get off the skateboard,
[23231.73s -> 23236.53s]  you have like five seconds with the combo meter still going.
[23248.80s -> 23256.44s]  Okay, that's special over here.
[23256.44s -> 23257.32s]  Why do I need special?
[23259.64s -> 23261.08s]  Get special and some speed first.
[23262.92s -> 23267.48s]  Okay, now over the wall.
[23268.84s -> 23269.48s]  Over this wall.
[23273.08s -> 23273.56s]  Behind you.
[23275.08s -> 23279.46s]  Special makes you faster for some reason.
[23279.46s -> 23279.94s]  Does it really?
[23281.70s -> 23284.26s]  All right, let me get some speed.
[23312.45s -> 23315.01s]  I'm not going forward.
[23315.01s -> 23323.81s]  I'm going to be going forward.
[23341.01s -> 23343.01s]  Are we sneaking into the Kremlin right now?
[23343.01s -> 23343.81s]  What are we doing?
[23345.89s -> 23349.81s]  Uh, Operation D's what?
[23357.01s -> 23358.29s]  Oh my god, really?
[23359.65s -> 23372.16s]  I can't believe we just got a D's nut kill.
[23373.84s -> 23377.19s]  Two more.
[23379.88s -> 23380.20s]  Hello.
[23381.56s -> 23383.48s]  That was some damn sweet kung fu.
[23384.92s -> 23386.20s]  One last thing to do.
[23386.20s -> 23388.28s]  Bam never has any clothes on.
[23388.28s -> 23388.60s]  Why?
[23389.96s -> 23391.80s]  Get up that ladder and ring those bells.
[23391.96s -> 23392.60s]  Easy.
[23394.48s -> 23396.80s]  We think the guards will run out and open the gate.
[23396.80s -> 23398.24s]  Yeah, it's a long shot.
[23398.24s -> 23398.72s]  Oh, yeah.
[23399.60s -> 23400.48s]  Don't get shot.
[23402.00s -> 23402.72s]  Ring the bell.
[23404.08s -> 23404.96s]  Ring the bells.
[23412.92s -> 23414.12s]  Um, oh god.
[23415.97s -> 23416.45s]  Caveman.
[23427.81s -> 23428.29s]  Trekkin' along.
[23434.76s -> 23435.64s]  Tanks.
[23435.64s -> 23437.73s]  A tank.
[23437.73s -> 23438.77s]  Look at these tanks.
[23439.81s -> 23441.01s]  Damn, look at these tanks.
[23441.81s -> 23443.09s]  It's probably pretty cold out here.
[23443.09s -> 23444.53s]  She's stoked by getting best new pro.
[23445.41s -> 23447.49s]  Well, it's not a done deal yet.
[23447.49s -> 23449.17s]  It's pretty close between me and Eric.
[23450.37s -> 23451.49s]  Sup, guys?
[23452.61s -> 23455.09s]  Listen, I've been thinking, we can't keep this up.
[23455.09s -> 23457.01s]  Remember how I used to torch action figures with you?
[23457.65s -> 23458.53s]  I acted like a dork.
[23458.53s -> 23459.73s]  I'm sorry, I got carried away.
[23465.97s -> 23468.77s]  No, we're going to get, we're going to get fucking double-crossed again.
[23468.77s -> 23470.53s]  Get out in front of those cameras and earn your keep.
[23472.61s -> 23473.33s]  So good.
[23473.33s -> 23475.01s]  We can't go skating right now.
[23475.01s -> 23476.77s]  Look at these tanks.
[23476.77s -> 23477.27s]  Damn.
[23478.23s -> 23480.54s]  Chapter 21.
[23480.54s -> 23481.90s]  Time to skate, comrade.
[23483.96s -> 23485.00s]  Christmas in Moscow?
[23495.05s -> 23497.37s]  Manuals for Moscovites.
[23497.37s -> 23498.57s]  Rodney Mullin.
[23498.57s -> 23500.65s]  Why are you hanging out here freezing your ass off?
[23503.53s -> 23504.57s]  I was waiting for it.
[23504.57s -> 23506.73s]  Somebody just went, what the fuck?
[23510.10s -> 23512.66s]  I know we've done that a lot tonight, but it's funny every time
[23512.66s -> 23514.90s]  because there's new people that experience it every time.
[23517.27s -> 23518.71s]  That's what makes it so much better.
[23522.95s -> 23523.67s]  Around to get more.
[23527.82s -> 23528.54s]  Manuals.
[23536.78s -> 23538.94s]  Should we be concerned about tanks pointing at us?
[23551.37s -> 23551.87s]  More.
[23551.87s -> 23558.46s]  Oh, that was broken, but okay.
[23568.43s -> 23572.08s]  I'm going to get blasted with a tank shell.
[23575.80s -> 23581.72s]  That would be, that would be, uh, Tony Hawk, what do you need?
[23582.36s -> 23582.86s]  Russia.
[23583.32s -> 23584.68s]  Cool, eh, comrade?
[23584.68s -> 23587.08s]  The locals are stoked on this chick I've been working on up here.
[23588.60s -> 23590.67s]  I'll tell you what, you give it a try.
[23590.67s -> 23592.91s]  Land tricks until you get your special meter full
[23592.91s -> 23594.83s]  and then do a 360 burial heel flip lean.
[23596.27s -> 23598.83s]  Okay, thanks, Tony.
[23607.39s -> 23608.03s]  Special move.
[23609.80s -> 23611.00s]  I'm not doing the flush.
[23611.00s -> 23613.56s]  We can't pull out the flush every five seconds.
[23615.80s -> 23617.96s]  It loses its comedic value if you do it.
[23619.72s -> 23621.72s]  So,
[23632.24s -> 23634.56s]  show me how well you know Moscow.
[23634.56s -> 23637.76s]  Oh, no, some gaps and you might get jobs later.
[23637.76s -> 23639.12s]  Too much media around here.
[23639.12s -> 23640.00s]  Find some gaps.
[23641.28s -> 23642.80s]  Find five gaps.
[23648.65s -> 23650.01s]  Three and a half minutes to do this.
[23651.82s -> 23652.46s]  Is this a gap?
[23653.42s -> 23658.86s]  That's kind of a gap.
[23687.29s -> 23687.85s]  Hey there.
[23688.41s -> 23690.09s]  Why are these reporters bugging you?
[23690.89s -> 23694.81s]  I feel like I'll be searching around for like 20 minutes.
[23698.83s -> 23699.63s]  I don't want to do that one.
[23708.52s -> 23710.12s]  Do they not have animated eyes?
[23710.12s -> 23710.84s]  Look at her eyes.
[23713.76s -> 23714.48s]  More manuals?
[23714.48s -> 23716.56s]  Get a 20,000 point manual combo.
[23717.68s -> 23717.92s]  Easy.
[23726.48s -> 23728.64s]  That's the easiest thing I've done all night.
[23728.64s -> 23730.96s]  If there were not so many reporters watching,
[23730.96s -> 23732.72s]  I'd show you some tricks too.
[23732.72s -> 23733.28s]  Bye-bye.
[23738.24s -> 23739.52s]  Oh, I like that pipe.
[23739.52s -> 23740.16s]  Let me try that.
[23742.44s -> 23742.84s]  Nice.
[23751.16s -> 23752.04s]  Pretty solid.
[23752.60s -> 23753.40s]  95,000.
[23753.40s -> 23761.45s]  For me, anything more than one to 200,000 is like,
[23761.45s -> 23763.21s]  all right, that was pretty good.
[23764.49s -> 23767.93s]  I know some of you guys are pros, but you know, I'm me.
[23773.98s -> 23774.46s]  Warm up.
[23786.57s -> 23788.09s]  Why is this guy talking like a sham?
[23788.09s -> 23788.49s]  Wow, dude.
[23790.01s -> 23790.25s]  Cool.
[23793.76s -> 23794.80s]  50,000 points.
[23795.68s -> 23796.40s]  I could do better.
[23806.51s -> 23808.03s]  Do I still have that on my bar?
[23826.33s -> 23827.45s]  Yeah, it's still on the bar.
[23827.45s -> 23828.33s]  It's still on my bar.
[23828.89s -> 23831.37s]  Yes, I'm using MMO terms right now,
[23831.37s -> 23832.25s]  but you know what I'm saying.
[23850.81s -> 23851.93s]  Where's the DPS?
[23852.97s -> 23856.36s]  I only have to do one more thing.
[23858.28s -> 23859.32s]  Ratings, stunts.
[23860.04s -> 23861.80s]  I want you to get some air time.
[23861.80s -> 23864.28s]  It should be easy with all the reporters around.
[23864.28s -> 23866.84s]  Try to score big points around them while they're broadcasting.
[23868.12s -> 23873.15s]  Unreal TV is doing a story under Lenin's statue
[23873.15s -> 23875.71s]  about him coming back to life as a robot.
[23875.71s -> 23878.99s]  NSBC is doing a corruption story near St. Basil.
[23878.99s -> 23880.67s]  I'm gonna do crazy shit over here, right?
[23880.67s -> 23881.55s]  On each one of these.
[23881.55s -> 23884.51s]  After that, Channel 9 is interviewing some actress
[23884.51s -> 23885.71s]  in front of the armory.
[23885.71s -> 23887.31s]  Now go rip it up at those spots,
[23887.31s -> 23889.15s]  and you're bound to get on TV.
[23890.75s -> 23892.43s]  Okay, all right.
[23894.54s -> 23895.66s]  State Lenin's statue.
[23895.66s -> 23896.38s]  Oh, you are on camera.
[23897.26s -> 23903.10s]  Sorry, I got 16,000.
[23907.45s -> 23908.25s]  Yes, all right.
[23908.25s -> 23910.17s]  I don't really like the scan lines all over my screen.
[23919.98s -> 23921.74s]  All right, I just destroyed that.
[23933.87s -> 23935.23s]  Is it possible that you could create a character
[23935.23s -> 23935.87s]  that looks normal?
[23938.19s -> 23939.07s]  What's the fun in that, though?
[23941.23s -> 23942.19s]  What's the fun in that?
[23942.83s -> 23944.91s]  Get 10,000 in double tricks.
[23946.11s -> 23951.04s]  This is like broke out of the glass.
[23953.40s -> 23954.84s]  Wait, does he do that, too?
[23955.40s -> 23973.29s]  All right, we just did that.
[23978.54s -> 23979.26s]  Am I holding him?
[23979.90s -> 23993.58s]  Why am I doing these?
[23994.14s -> 23994.86s]  I feel like these are...
[23996.06s -> 23998.54s]  The points are much easier to attain here.
[24006.84s -> 24008.44s]  He did not do any of that correctly.
[24008.44s -> 24009.00s]  Well, yeah, I did.
[24009.00s -> 24011.40s]  I just had to get points when he was getting points, too.
[24011.40s -> 24012.76s]  We got points together at the same time.
[24012.76s -> 24013.32s]  Double points.
[24030.16s -> 24034.60s]  Did they put a tank level in Tony Hawk?
[24036.44s -> 24038.12s]  I will be shocked if this is the case.
[24044.84s -> 24055.79s]  This is not a dude stop it scenario.
[24056.91s -> 24070.64s]  It's not like somebody throwing TP.
[24071.60s -> 24072.80s]  Like a Halloween prank.
[24073.92s -> 24076.00s]  This is driving a tank into a building.
[24086.01s -> 24093.40s]  I missed the competition, is that what happened?
[24098.84s -> 24099.72s]  God damn it, Eric.
[24112.28s -> 24113.80s]  Get the check from the parents.
[24113.80s -> 24114.84s]  The kid's off the team.
[24119.48s -> 24121.96s]  You are very lucky your embassy has freed you.
[24121.96s -> 24125.08s]  Too bad your team has left you here to rot all by yourself, eh?
[24125.64s -> 24127.24s]  Good luck finding a way home.
[24130.68s -> 24134.36s]  Okay, I'm now stuck in Moscow.
[24141.87s -> 24144.03s]  The first thing I do when I get out, I don't call my mom.
[24144.99s -> 24146.43s]  I do a manual combo.
[24148.11s -> 24149.47s]  All right, how do I get out of here?
[24168.97s -> 24169.77s]  How do I activate?
[24176.49s -> 24177.29s]  What do we got for goals?
[24179.50s -> 24181.18s]  An anonymous caller.
[24201.61s -> 24203.80s]  That was him on the phone.
[24203.80s -> 24225.63s]  Oh boy, that was bad all the way around.
[24225.63s -> 24232.40s]  I'm supposed to take it off a bar and I can't.
[24233.04s -> 24252.57s]  I think that's how you play a game like this.
[24252.65s -> 24256.01s]  You just get so, you get so perfectionist.
[24256.01s -> 24258.33s]  You just want to do everything so good and so perfect
[24258.33s -> 24259.53s]  and then you do it wrong even a little bit.
[24259.53s -> 24261.13s]  You're like, no, no, no, do it again, do it again, do it again.
[24261.13s -> 24262.09s]  I don't want to, no, do it again, do it again.
[24283.72s -> 24284.52s]  Stop doing tricks.
[24285.48s -> 24289.20s]  It's like going to McDonald's and somebody's in the backseat going,
[24289.20s -> 24291.28s]  just don't, don't eat any hamburger.
[24307.04s -> 24307.84s]  Order a salad.
[24313.84s -> 24317.28s]  The electromagnetic forces you create will disable the tower.
[24319.28s -> 24320.40s]  Spins over the roof.
[24327.64s -> 24330.92s]  All right, got to go over 15 spins.
[24343.32s -> 24345.48s]  Holy shit, I feel like this is going to be hell.
[24349.72s -> 24355.61s]  Is this the only one I have to do it to?
[24355.61s -> 24356.65s]  Or are they all over the place?
[24363.05s -> 24364.17s]  Wait, let me get off the board.
[24364.17s -> 24365.85s]  Is there more than one or is it just these two?
[24367.29s -> 24368.25s]  It's just these two, huh?
[24371.05s -> 24373.61s]  15 full spins with spine transfer.
[24379.37s -> 24380.99s]  Do the flush.
[24380.99s -> 24381.79s]  I don't think that counts.
[24386.33s -> 24387.13s]  Why did it go the other way?
[24389.77s -> 24391.21s]  See, like why is it doing that?
[24391.29s -> 24391.77s]  What are you doing?
[24403.84s -> 24406.32s]  Yeah, all right, I got to, I got to go straight because this is just
[24406.32s -> 24408.16s]  such a small disorienting area.
[24408.88s -> 24410.64s]  They, they say, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[24412.81s -> 24416.73s]  Back and forth, back and forth, straight over.
[24417.93s -> 24418.57s]  Oh, God.
[24419.53s -> 24426.32s]  Flush is going to save you.
[24426.32s -> 24429.60s]  No, it's, it's not, it's actually 360 spins.
[24429.60s -> 24430.16s]  Watch, ready?
[24430.16s -> 24430.88s]  It's not what you think.
[24433.36s -> 24434.40s]  It's not what you think.
[24435.92s -> 24442.94s]  I have to use the analog here because that's going to keep happening.
[24443.90s -> 24454.62s]  15 fucking times.
[24466.40s -> 24468.00s]  Watch, watch.
[24468.00s -> 24470.96s]  It's going to be hard to do it.
[24470.96s -> 24471.60s]  Trust me.
[24473.12s -> 24475.52s]  It's not going to do what you think it is.
[24482.84s -> 24486.20s]  Spining over and then down, down, B is actually fucking hard to do.
[24486.84s -> 24503.32s]  It's rough.
[24504.28s -> 24507.85s]  All right.
[24507.85s -> 24509.56s]  No, no, that's not even the controller.
[24509.56s -> 24521.15s]  He's spinning back.
[24521.15s -> 24529.84s]  Why is he going the other way when I go to more than 540 goes the other way?
[24530.96s -> 24532.16s]  I don't know why it's happening.
[24532.16s -> 24532.88s]  That shouldn't be happening.
[24533.92s -> 24536.00s]  See what the fuck was, what is going on there?
[24536.00s -> 24536.56s]  Why is that happening?
[24537.44s -> 24542.54s]  What is it?
[24542.54s -> 24543.02s]  Why is it doing that?
[24543.82s -> 24544.78s]  What the fuck?
[24544.78s -> 24546.94s]  That something weird is going on here.
[24546.94s -> 24552.00s]  Something weird going on here.
[24556.20s -> 24556.76s]  One more try.
[24556.76s -> 24559.36s]  I don't want to do this one.
[24559.36s -> 24569.92s]  This one.
[24569.92s -> 24571.84s]  I have to do it.
[24571.84s -> 24572.48s]  I have to do it.
[24574.89s -> 24575.85s]  Have to do three of them all.
[24575.85s -> 24580.72s]  I'm not holding the triggers.
[24580.72s -> 24583.04s]  I have to hold the triggers to go over the.
[24583.04s -> 24583.76s]  Is that what's happening?
[24583.76s -> 24587.60s]  Because I have to hold both triggers to go over the satellites.
[24587.60s -> 24589.84s]  So I have to be holding them in the first place.
[24598.56s -> 24599.44s]  Wait, I don't have to hold them.
[24599.44s -> 24600.88s]  I just tap them.
[24605.50s -> 24606.78s]  Where's my clothes?
[24606.78s -> 24607.50s]  Why am I naked?
[24621.37s -> 24622.09s]  Pick the boss up.
[24627.13s -> 24627.93s]  Arrow freaked me out.
[24632.97s -> 24634.73s]  A lot of random car levels.
[24635.45s -> 24639.88s]  Is that him?
[24644.44s -> 24645.08s]  That was weird.
[24646.09s -> 24646.57s]  Do it again.
[24649.71s -> 24650.51s]  Boston band?
[24650.51s -> 24650.99s]  Yeah, it is.
[24666.68s -> 24674.22s]  It should be.
[24680.67s -> 24681.79s]  Where's this arrow going?
[24682.75s -> 24691.24s]  Do a royal flush with the car.
[24691.24s -> 24691.72s]  I can't.
[24708.68s -> 24721.44s]  Earn.
[24721.44s -> 24724.32s]  I, crazily enough, I didn't hit anybody.
[24730.92s -> 24731.96s]  Nobody got injured there.
[24732.52s -> 24733.42s]  I was fine.
[24741.34s -> 24741.98s]  Go get her.
[24741.98s -> 24742.30s]  Okay.
[24749.28s -> 24750.80s]  Simpsons hit and run all over again.
[24751.36s -> 24755.55s]  Even the timer is similar.
[24757.29s -> 24757.93s]  Jesus.
[24757.93s -> 24759.05s]  There's another person.
[24772.08s -> 24781.40s]  What?
[24781.40s -> 24781.90s]  Rita?
[24784.91s -> 24786.35s]  Lariska called for a ride.
[24790.52s -> 24792.52s]  Can't you guys all be in the same spot?
[24810.46s -> 24812.36s]  All right.
[24813.08s -> 24816.59s]  I'm going for this one again.
[24820.33s -> 24820.81s]  Here we go.
[24822.97s -> 24823.31s]  Hike.
[24841.00s -> 24847.40s]  Oh, God.
[24868.97s -> 24869.61s]  Okay.
[24869.61s -> 24870.41s]  Now let's try this again.
[24872.17s -> 24873.05s]  Failed when walking.
[24873.05s -> 24873.93s]  I don't know how I did that.
[24874.81s -> 24875.21s]  Here we go.
[24875.21s -> 24875.45s]  Let's go.
[24877.69s -> 24878.09s]  Okay.
[24878.09s -> 24878.33s]  Yep.
[24878.33s -> 24879.61s]  That's exactly what was happening to me.
[24880.01s -> 24891.87s]  I hate this area.
[24893.55s -> 24895.87s]  It's just, it's too, it's like so claustrophobic up here.
[24919.21s -> 24927.85s]  I'm going to do 15 oftentimes.
[24940.00s -> 24941.76s]  Why does Cookie Monster sometimes talk?
[24943.04s -> 24945.02s]  I haven't figured that out yet.
[24950.33s -> 24951.37s]  Watching this makes me sick.
[24952.01s -> 24954.57s]  Playing it also does as well.
[24955.64s -> 24967.37s]  I feel your pain.
[24970.73s -> 24972.09s]  You didn't read chat's joke.
[24972.09s -> 24973.77s]  You made your own minus two joke.
[24977.77s -> 24978.81s]  What are you talking about?
[24981.71s -> 24983.23s]  I asked a question.
[24987.60s -> 24989.92s]  Where is that Cookie Monster voice coming from?
[24990.80s -> 24992.08s]  Remember, that wasn't a very good joke.
[24994.28s -> 24996.20s]  It was a question, sir.
[25010.11s -> 25012.51s]  One of these days, Jerome is going to snap.
[25014.40s -> 25015.04s]  Why?
[25015.04s -> 25015.84s]  What do you think that?
[25019.40s -> 25021.24s]  Is there any particular reason why you think that?
[25023.55s -> 25024.27s]  Do explain.
[25024.27s -> 25026.35s]  I'd like to know what your hypothesis.
[25036.52s -> 25037.16s]  One more.
[25037.16s -> 25040.25s]  No, no, no, no.
[25040.25s -> 25040.75s]  Why?
[25061.21s -> 25062.33s]  You cannot refuse.
[25063.61s -> 25064.99s]  You're not going to complete this one?
[25065.79s -> 25069.66s]  I have to.
[25070.22s -> 25074.64s]  Perhaps you find cures for me.
[25074.64s -> 25078.24s]  And then I talk to the organization about getting you back home.
[25082.70s -> 25094.48s]  Aspirin, water, vitamin A, vitamin D, dog poop.
[25094.48s -> 25094.96s]  What was it?
[25095.84s -> 25100.27s]  Where is it?
[25100.91s -> 25104.80s]  People pink stuff.
[25105.60s -> 25113.76s]  Let's see, up there.
[25115.28s -> 25116.64s]  No, stop.
[25116.64s -> 25116.96s]  Grab it.
[25135.64s -> 25136.20s]  Get off the bike.
[25137.16s -> 25137.80s]  Skate or whatever.
[25142.65s -> 25148.59s]  Actually, just climb up is probably easier.
[25155.79s -> 25156.75s]  Feeling stronger.
[25165.15s -> 25165.79s]  Whoa.
[25165.79s -> 25168.11s]  I just got sucked into a black hole there.
[25168.11s -> 25168.43s]  Hold on.
[25181.92s -> 25182.88s]  I got to get up.
[25182.88s -> 25186.60s]  Can I jump up here?
[25188.36s -> 25188.92s]  I don't think so.
[25190.17s -> 25190.89s]  I got it.
[25190.89s -> 25192.17s]  I just looked into the wall and got it.
[25196.88s -> 25197.36s]  Here, too.
[25206.11s -> 25207.47s]  Aida Caratine.
[25207.47s -> 25207.95s]  Turn around.
[25209.76s -> 25210.32s]  Get out of here.
[25213.55s -> 25214.67s]  I can't grab that one.
[25215.23s -> 25221.60s]  Where's there a line that I can get up here from?
[25221.60s -> 25222.00s]  This way?
[25224.64s -> 25225.52s]  Oh, shit.
[25225.52s -> 25225.84s]  Hold on.
[25226.64s -> 25227.44s]  Do I have to get up there?
[25229.77s -> 25230.17s]  Not good.
[25247.77s -> 25248.81s]  Get up there.
[25248.81s -> 25261.77s]  Is there another way to get up here besides having to jump up here?
[25262.65s -> 25271.02s]  Here?
[25271.58s -> 25271.90s]  Hold on.
[25271.90s -> 25272.30s]  Let's see.
[25273.34s -> 25282.92s]  No.
[25283.72s -> 25284.86s]  I have to.
[25284.86s -> 25285.82s]  I have to just jump across it.
[25296.44s -> 25297.93s]  Shit.
[25297.93s -> 25298.17s]  No.
[25299.45s -> 25300.09s]  No.
[25300.09s -> 25300.97s]  I'm so close.
[25300.97s -> 25302.01s]  Get off the bike.
[25302.01s -> 25303.29s]  I keep going on the bike.
[25304.01s -> 25305.85s]  It's seven hours of screaming that goes through your brain.
[25306.57s -> 25319.39s]  I'm going to have to do it again.
[25325.95s -> 25328.11s]  I'm going to have to do it again.
[25328.11s -> 25328.91s]  Stay up here.
[25328.91s -> 25329.23s]  No.
[25330.19s -> 25334.91s]  I'm trying to just jump over it.
[25337.87s -> 25340.00s]  Let's do it again.
[25351.76s -> 25356.08s]  I had it, too.
[25358.16s -> 25359.20s]  Cleaner this time.
[25359.20s -> 25360.08s]  You don't even have to touch them.
[25362.80s -> 25384.72s]  I got to get some water.
[25385.84s -> 25386.72s]  I got to drink some water.
[25387.76s -> 25388.56s]  It's blending together.
[25390.16s -> 25391.36s]  The world's blending together.
[25391.36s -> 25392.16s]  I got to get some water.
[25392.80s -> 25395.90s]  I got to get some water.
[25395.90s -> 25397.58s]  All tricks are becoming the same trick.
[25398.38s -> 25399.90s]  And all lines are the same line.
[25401.72s -> 25416.14s]  It's water time.
[25416.14s -> 25417.58s]  Remember the guy that wrote it all caps?
[25417.58s -> 25419.26s]  You're never going to beat this mission.
[25422.96s -> 25423.28s]  Okay.
[25423.28s -> 25436.44s]  All right, let's go.
[25452.59s -> 25453.07s]  Wink.
[25453.07s -> 25469.24s]  I'm in the middle of a really, really hard mission.
[25470.28s -> 25471.40s]  Just hold on a second.
[25472.12s -> 25480.91s]  Oh, my God.
[25480.91s -> 25482.59s]  Stop getting stuck on every polygon.
[25483.31s -> 25488.25s]  There it is.
[25489.13s -> 25493.88s]  No, I was on it.
[25493.88s -> 25494.84s]  Why did I have to jump?
[25496.48s -> 25496.80s]  Fuck.
[25497.36s -> 25498.96s]  No, no.
[25506.49s -> 25508.17s]  I got to go up around that again.
[25508.17s -> 25508.97s]  It's the only way to do it.
[25521.76s -> 25523.12s]  I don't like this area.
[25526.64s -> 25529.60s]  This is my least favorite level in the game so far.
[25529.60s -> 25557.04s]  I have to get on this and then I make it from I have to just jump to jump the tower.
[25561.20s -> 25562.80s]  I have to just jump over this tower.
[25562.80s -> 25571.12s]  I can get over here.
[25580.67s -> 25591.48s]  The ladder over there is seriously.
[25599.16s -> 25599.48s]  Okay.
[25599.48s -> 25600.28s]  Get me the fuck over here.
[25600.28s -> 25601.08s]  Get off the get off.
[25601.08s -> 25601.72s]  Get off.
[25601.72s -> 25605.48s]  Where is it?
[25612.20s -> 25612.76s]  Oh, my God.
[25612.76s -> 25616.44s]  I'm going to scream into this microphone and fucking blow out my vocal cords.
[25622.36s -> 25634.52s]  That was horrible.
[25646.20s -> 25647.48s]  Don't look inside.
[25650.57s -> 25653.37s]  Don't let any of the guards see you with it either.
[25653.37s -> 25656.17s]  They are on the walls and there are many more in this.
[25656.17s -> 25657.93s]  Wait, now that I can focus.
[25660.41s -> 25661.85s]  And you made it into the cave.
[25662.81s -> 25666.25s]  The cave of the greasy fucking mad streamer.
[25669.88s -> 25671.96s]  What questions do you have for me?
[25671.96s -> 25679.92s]  Alexander is near St. Basil's.
[25679.92s -> 25682.16s]  It is the pointy thing you don't remember.
[25690.76s -> 25691.00s]  Bye.
[25691.00s -> 25694.68s]  Bye.
[25694.68s -> 25695.88s]  Get me out of Moscow.
[25697.44s -> 25698.96s]  I don't like that wall.
[25698.96s -> 25699.84s]  I don't like that wall.
[25699.84s -> 25705.12s]  Oh, there's the ladder that everyone was talking about.
[25722.25s -> 25723.77s]  Oh, you can't like punch.
[25723.77s -> 25726.57s]  I can't like jump on them and knock them down.
[25727.85s -> 25728.09s]  What?
[25728.09s -> 25729.29s]  I can't knock them down.
[25729.29s -> 25731.21s]  I can't like run into them with my skateboard.
[25733.93s -> 25735.69s]  I've just done a stealth mission.
[25735.69s -> 25736.49s]  Oh, great.
[25741.74s -> 25742.70s]  Go around that guard.
[25743.58s -> 25760.44s]  Wink, redeem.
[25760.44s -> 25760.76s]  Hold on.
[25760.76s -> 25761.80s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[25761.80s -> 25762.76s]  I can't stop.
[25762.76s -> 25763.72s]  Don't you understand?
[25763.72s -> 25764.60s]  I can't.
[25764.60s -> 25767.48s]  I'm going to be in big trouble if I fuck this up.
[25768.04s -> 25770.62s]  Is there a guard down there?
[25771.34s -> 25772.99s]  Can I skate this?
[25776.91s -> 25777.23s]  Fuck.
[25777.23s -> 25801.21s]  You are going home, but you are welcome back here anytime.
[25801.21s -> 25804.43s]  I did it.
[25804.43s -> 25816.48s]  You look horrifying.
[25816.48s -> 25818.97s]  Come on.
[25818.97s -> 25819.45s]  Come on.
[25819.45s -> 25819.93s]  Give me a...
[25820.73s -> 25821.61s]  Come on, man.
[25822.33s -> 25827.66s]  As I walked into your room one day when you were sitting there playing a game
[25827.66s -> 25829.18s]  and I just like knocked on the door.
[25830.14s -> 25833.34s]  And you're in the dark and you turn and I just go, you look fucking horrible.
[25834.78s -> 25836.64s]  I gotta close the door.
[25836.64s -> 25838.40s]  I don't care how many kids are waiting.
[25839.20s -> 25844.01s]  Who's here?
[25844.01s -> 25846.01s]  I was hoping to see you.
[25846.01s -> 25849.69s]  I never got to thank you for handing me best new pro back in Russia.
[25849.69s -> 25851.21s]  You still don't get it.
[25851.21s -> 25852.09s]  No, homie.
[25852.09s -> 25853.21s]  I got it all.
[25853.21s -> 25856.65s]  My own company, six cars in my garage, a record deal in the worst company.
[25856.65s -> 25857.77s]  Russia to New Jersey.
[25857.77s -> 25858.73s]  How long is that flight?
[25859.37s -> 25860.09s]  You go ahead.
[25860.09s -> 25863.29s]  Keep telling yourself you're happy, but it ain't about the money.
[25863.37s -> 25865.93s]  I can't believe I'm wasting my time with this jackass.
[25865.93s -> 25868.49s]  He probably skates for minimum wage.
[25868.49s -> 25868.97s]  See ya.
[25871.82s -> 25872.46s]  You'll see.
[25872.46s -> 25873.66s]  I'm not going anywhere.
[25873.66s -> 25875.58s]  I still got a few real friends left.
[25877.18s -> 25877.98s]  Like Tony Hawk.
[25879.02s -> 25880.62s]  He gives me a stomach ache.
[25880.62s -> 25884.06s]  I can't believe kids will look at Eric and think that's what skating is about.
[25884.78s -> 25887.18s]  Look, you got a deal if you want to make it as a pro.
[25887.90s -> 25890.38s]  Man, I just want to skate like the old days.
[25890.38s -> 25892.94s]  It used to relax me, not stress me out.
[25893.58s -> 25894.94s]  That's your deal, man.
[25895.50s -> 25897.50s]  Skating is whatever you make it.
[25897.50s -> 25898.94s]  It didn't change.
[25898.94s -> 25900.62s]  You're the one that changed.
[25900.62s -> 25901.98s]  Now go skate.
[25901.98s -> 25904.06s]  You'll remember why you started in the first place.
[25905.02s -> 25907.34s]  Oh no, he hates, he hates skating now.
[25909.40s -> 25910.68s]  He hates skating.
[25913.02s -> 25914.30s]  He used to love skating.
[25914.30s -> 25916.06s]  Hey, good to see you again.
[25916.78s -> 25919.10s]  How's that whole life been working out for you?
[25921.21s -> 25923.37s]  Hey, Sean, going okay.
[25923.37s -> 25924.97s]  About to get a lot better.
[25924.97s -> 25926.57s]  I'm going to make a comeback.
[25926.65s -> 25928.33s]  Check out this new trick I invented.
[25930.49s -> 25932.49s]  Damn, you are shooting for a comeback.
[25932.49s -> 25933.37s]  Do I get to show him?
[25935.63s -> 25936.27s]  Let's see it.
[25952.70s -> 25954.54s]  That's the cannon one that I invented.
[25957.39s -> 25958.75s]  Oh, that's so stupid.
[25960.11s -> 25970.03s]  That's so much worse than mine.
[25970.03s -> 25971.31s]  Mine's way better.
[25971.31s -> 25984.16s]  Create a trick, welcome.
[25984.16s -> 25985.20s]  You can create, yes, I know.
[25986.40s -> 25987.36s]  Modify my trick.
[26014.35s -> 26020.88s]  Funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
[26022.56s -> 26023.44s]  But it shouldn't be.
[26033.05s -> 26035.13s]  That's like shouldn't be the funniest thing ever.
[26036.19s -> 26040.67s]  Okay, so we're back in New Jersey, ready to go.
[26041.31s -> 26050.65s]  And the first thing, what do we have to do here?
[26052.41s -> 26054.17s]  Combo the entire city.
[26056.73s -> 26059.53s]  Hell yeah, I remember you doing sweet lines way back when.
[26060.09s -> 26061.45s]  Got a new one, eh?
[26061.45s -> 26063.77s]  All right, I'll put it on film, you hit it.
[26064.57s -> 26077.37s]  Combo the whole city.
[26077.93s -> 26097.34s]  Oh man, this is going to be tricky.
[26098.46s -> 26105.07s]  I'm going to jump off.
[26109.02s -> 26110.78s]  I hate this because I was bad at this.
[26114.80s -> 26116.00s]  This is hard, this game's not easy.
[26123.45s -> 26124.17s]  Seven out of ten.
[26135.79s -> 26137.71s]  I want to get some water too, I forgot to do that.
[26137.71s -> 26138.27s]  I really need it.
[26139.71s -> 26143.39s]  Yeah, I'm starting to get a little hydration deprived.
[26145.07s -> 26146.19s]  I'll be right back.
[26146.19s -> 26146.75s]  Get some water.
[26440.78s -> 26445.31s]  Okay, fully hydrated.
[26446.11s -> 26452.73s]  I drank a full glass.
[26452.73s -> 26459.05s]  I'm ready to go.
[26459.93s -> 26460.81s]  Ready?
[26460.81s -> 26462.01s]  Oh, this is the power of hydration.
[26463.45s -> 26467.36s]  It hasn't gotten in my bloodstream yet.
[26467.36s -> 26468.00s]  Hold on.
[26468.00s -> 26478.72s]  My manual's dropping so hard.
[26479.60s -> 26481.13s]  My manual's just dumping.
[26481.13s -> 26482.41s]  I don't even need to start there.
[26482.41s -> 26483.85s]  That's a shitty line to start on.
[26484.81s -> 26485.93s]  Sorry, wait.
[26486.97s -> 26489.26s]  Oh, only five seconds, that's...
[26489.26s -> 26490.46s]  Oh god, okay.
[26491.02s -> 26513.92s]  That's kind of like a trap, I feel like that's a trap.
[26515.04s -> 26527.58s]  Oh, there we go.
[26527.58s -> 26528.08s]  There it is.
[26528.46s -> 26528.96s]  No!
[26531.34s -> 26534.11s]  All right, you just have to hold, you stay on it.
[26534.99s -> 26536.35s]  This stupid fucking flip.
[26540.17s -> 26542.33s]  Oh, that manual is going to be hard to hold.
[26543.29s -> 26547.93s]  That was almost really cool, almost.
[26555.42s -> 26573.53s]  Oops, ah, I didn't hit it.
[26574.33s -> 26578.67s]  Get off the board.
[26578.67s -> 26579.95s]  Yeah, that's true, I can do that.
[26580.91s -> 26582.94s]  Let's see if I can get it in one go though.
[26583.66s -> 26586.35s]  I'm currently addicted.
[26604.00s -> 26604.88s]  Why are you not facing me?
[26604.88s -> 26605.38s]  Look at me.
[26606.08s -> 26613.32s]  He didn't even want to look at me.
[26613.96s -> 26616.06s]  I just did the sickest combo ever.
[26617.98s -> 26618.86s]  Five community subs from...
[26620.38s -> 26620.88s]  Six.
[26621.66s -> 26622.38s]  Thanks, Pelsix.
[26636.65s -> 26639.53s]  Perfect, then all we need to do is find a great name for our team.
[26640.65s -> 26641.93s]  Name the team, okay.
[26642.97s -> 26647.77s]  Before any of these other guys are going to want to know that I'm still for real.
[26649.05s -> 26652.41s]  I'm guessing with everything that's been going on, most people have forgotten.
[26653.45s -> 26656.01s]  Well, I guess I'll just have to remind everyone.
[26656.97s -> 26673.52s]  Let's go.
[26684.67s -> 26685.47s]  That reminds her...
[26685.47s -> 26685.97s]  What?
[26686.59s -> 26687.46s]  Fell off?
[26688.97s -> 26690.49s]  I just wanted to turn around.
[26691.45s -> 26694.24s]  Flush.
[26695.26s -> 26703.42s]  This guy's made out of...
[26704.14s -> 26706.14s]  This guy's made out of rubber bands.
[26706.14s -> 26707.50s]  For the love of God.
[26707.50s -> 26710.38s]  He says I keep kicking the shit out of this guy.
[26711.58s -> 26712.62s]  I feel so bad.
[26717.58s -> 26718.22s]  All right, let's do it.
[26728.49s -> 26729.69s]  Nail all the tricks.
[26730.65s -> 26732.25s]  Come on, somebody's air-conditioning.
[26749.74s -> 26750.22s]  Wait, what?
[26750.22s -> 26751.26s]  Stop, stop, stop!
[26751.26s -> 26752.00s]  Do it again.
[26763.31s -> 26766.35s]  Is this not low house lift?
[26766.35s -> 26767.07s]  Oh, I got it, I got it.
[26771.05s -> 26774.54s]  Tony Hawk's got a game.
[26774.54s -> 26775.82s]  Yep, he's got a few of them.
[26776.38s -> 26781.02s]  Tony Hawk 1, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2,
[26781.02s -> 26783.66s]  Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Tony Hawk for the Weave,
[26783.66s -> 26785.42s]  Tony Hawk for the Weave with a skateboard...
[26785.42s -> 26786.62s]  Ruff-Roll, what else does he have?
[26789.05s -> 26791.53s]  Tony Hawk Project 8, right?
[26794.56s -> 26795.52s]  Tony Hawk 4, right.
[26796.16s -> 26805.42s]  All right, um, Burial Invert to Fakie.
[26805.42s -> 26810.33s]  Oh, how am I doing this wrong?
[26815.39s -> 26817.39s]  How am I doing this wrong?
[26817.39s -> 26819.63s]  That's just a lift trick, isn't it?
[26838.57s -> 26839.69s]  Let's switch rooms.
[26842.25s -> 26845.69s]  All right, lift tricks always are just kind of...
[26847.29s -> 26849.45s]  You know, I've played every Tony Hawk game.
[26849.45s -> 26854.73s]  I still don't really understand how a lift trick actually even works to not grind.
[26857.05s -> 26858.65s]  Like, you know what I'm saying?
[26859.61s -> 26863.69s]  Because I'm only, I'm doing up and wide, but there's other tricks that I can do.
[26863.85s -> 26867.77s]  I thought these specials, they might be.
[26888.25s -> 26890.41s]  See, I always have trouble with these plants.
[26892.49s -> 26894.57s]  I just try to do left and wide at the same time.
[26901.29s -> 26911.98s]  Here we go, more of this Invert, that's a gymnast plant.
[26913.58s -> 26923.68s]  Invert, Invert, Invert.
[26923.68s -> 26931.04s]  Isn't that what I'm doing?
[26931.04s -> 26931.76s]  Switch a room.
[26932.40s -> 26932.96s]  There it is.
[26934.73s -> 26936.64s]  One foot, okay.
[26940.67s -> 26942.83s]  Burial, I can't get this one though.
[26943.47s -> 26949.24s]  Nose butt, whatever, nose, whatever.
[26950.04s -> 26951.04s]  There it is.
[26951.04s -> 26952.80s]  All right, it's because of the analog.
[26954.72s -> 26955.20s]  One second.
[26956.72s -> 26959.76s]  It's because I wasn't, the D-pad sucks with it.
[26959.76s -> 26962.24s]  So if I need to do a plant trick, I'll just use the analog.
[26963.20s -> 26978.03s]  All right, we got one more thing to do here and then what's next?
[26981.92s -> 26984.56s]  Score a big, all right, a million points.
[26991.12s -> 26992.96s]  Big points, 200,000 points, let's go.
[27001.39s -> 27001.89s]  What?
[27003.69s -> 27004.43s]  Did I lose it?
[27006.43s -> 27016.00s]  Restart Randy, I know.
[27017.44s -> 27019.68s]  I'm like this with every one of these games though.
[27019.68s -> 27020.72s]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[27021.52s -> 27025.21s]  I feel like my balance has gotten worse.
[27026.09s -> 27029.20s]  Is that like even possible?
[27029.20s -> 27029.70s]  No way.
[27030.56s -> 27038.17s]  That just fucked me up.
[27038.97s -> 27041.63s]  I have to restart.
[27041.63s -> 27042.35s]  That was so bad.
[27047.40s -> 27048.36s]  That move, man.
[27048.36s -> 27049.72s]  I got to get that out of here.
[27049.72s -> 27050.92s]  I got to delete that move.
[27051.56s -> 27069.84s]  All right, 80,000, look at that.
[27069.84s -> 27072.00s]  Huge gift subs, just a second.
[27086.52s -> 27087.80s]  Yeah, I was trying to grab onto that.
[27088.44s -> 27094.94s]  Ow.
[27095.96s -> 27113.58s]  There we go.
[27113.58s -> 27115.02s]  That's exactly what I want to do.
[27115.02s -> 27117.24s]  It's an old secret technique.
[27117.24s -> 27122.88s]  That was a lot.
[27122.88s -> 27130.72s]  Hey, where it is you've really been tearing it up.
[27131.28s -> 27132.80s]  Here you're starting a new team as well.
[27133.52s -> 27136.48s]  This bear is getting really good at video games.
[27137.20s -> 27137.60s]  You know what?
[27137.60s -> 27141.20s]  That's the fucking like that's the comment that I like to see the most.
[27141.92s -> 27143.74s]  The answer is no, though.
[27147.96s -> 27149.56s]  They say you want to cut through all the bullshit.
[27150.12s -> 27152.36s]  Just hook up some guys that want to see how far they can take skating.
[27153.64s -> 27156.76s]  Imagine getting mad at a fart joke.
[27157.48s -> 27158.44s]  Would somebody mad here?
[27159.56s -> 27162.54s]  Wait, is somebody actually upset here?
[27164.43s -> 27166.91s]  Did somebody come in and say like, fuck, that's not fucking funny?
[27167.71s -> 27168.83s]  Shit.
[27169.23s -> 27169.71s]  Yes.
[27169.71s -> 27170.35s]  Oh, no.
[27174.35s -> 27175.39s]  You know, all right, whatever.
[27175.39s -> 27176.91s]  That means I'll do it three more times in a row.
[27176.91s -> 27178.11s]  I think that sounds pretty cool.
[27179.07s -> 27182.83s]  Pick your team members.
[27182.83s -> 27183.95s]  Bam Margera, of course.
[27184.75s -> 27187.68s]  Tony Hawk.
[27189.92s -> 27190.64s]  And who?
[27191.44s -> 27193.18s]  Tony Hawk, Bam Margera.
[27194.24s -> 27197.94s]  And this is Pup.
[27199.14s -> 27199.78s]  Chad Muska.
[27200.58s -> 27205.46s]  Hey, Chad Muska was there when we first started.
[27206.34s -> 27211.14s]  Chad Muska found us and discovered us and gave us our first gig.
[27211.86s -> 27216.06s]  Chad Muska can do more.
[27216.78s -> 27218.48s]  It's Rodney.
[27219.79s -> 27221.63s]  Rodney, Rodney, Rodney, Rodney Mullen.
[27222.90s -> 27235.25s]  And Eric.
[27238.30s -> 27243.78s]  Wait, is that the evil Eric or is Mike V?
[27246.34s -> 27247.94s]  That's not evil Eric, right?
[27247.94s -> 27248.98s]  All right, yeah, Eric.
[27248.98s -> 27249.48s]  Eric Tom.
[27250.10s -> 27254.32s]  So the name of the team is going to be the Destructors.
[27259.89s -> 27261.81s]  How about Questers?
[27262.45s -> 27263.63s]  Crunchers.
[27264.59s -> 27265.79s]  The Flush Force.
[27266.35s -> 27266.99s]  Flush Force.
[27267.55s -> 27268.75s]  Sounds good to me.
[27269.55s -> 27289.14s]  Flush Force.
[27289.86s -> 27293.14s]  Flush Force Assemble.
[27295.06s -> 27296.10s]  You know what would be awesome?
[27296.10s -> 27298.66s]  If I could give them different moves.
[27298.66s -> 27300.26s]  Just give them all for every move.
[27300.26s -> 27300.50s]  I thought.
[27300.50s -> 27301.22s]  Okay, we gotta kill a team.
[27301.22s -> 27302.82s]  Now to spread the word.
[27302.82s -> 27304.42s]  We're gonna make an escape video.
[27304.42s -> 27306.34s]  But we're not gonna make some cookie cutter film
[27306.34s -> 27308.66s]  where everybody is skating the same stuff.
[27308.66s -> 27310.82s]  We're gonna make something bigger and better.
[27310.82s -> 27312.50s]  Totally unexpected.
[27312.50s -> 27313.62s]  Check this, dude.
[27313.62s -> 27314.98s]  I've had this for years.
[27315.86s -> 27317.70s]  I've been saving this list of secret spots
[27317.70s -> 27318.74s]  since Animal Chin.
[27320.50s -> 27322.42s]  You know, it's actually...
[27322.98s -> 27325.38s]  I'm supposed to do shit like that.
[27325.38s -> 27326.74s]  Big Apple Spot Challenge.
[27326.74s -> 27327.22s]  Here it is.
[27327.22s -> 27328.26s]  You still have your steak and cheese?
[27338.37s -> 27339.01s]  Get ready to...
[27339.97s -> 27340.53s]  Get ready to...
[27341.25s -> 27342.21s]  Here we go.
[27342.21s -> 27343.49s]  I have four attempts to do this.
[27344.13s -> 27345.01s]  It was a cheese steak.
[27345.01s -> 27346.05s]  I just said steak and cheese.
[27346.05s -> 27346.45s]  Next part.
[27346.45s -> 27348.21s]  I want to shoot just one long take.
[27348.21s -> 27349.65s]  You know, get some smooth...
[27349.65s -> 27349.97s]  What?
[27349.97s -> 27351.33s]  Street skating to New York.
[27353.10s -> 27353.98s]  You just reversed it.
[27355.49s -> 27356.45s]  Bacon Cheese Challenge.
[27356.45s -> 27357.01s]  Here it comes.
[27359.58s -> 27361.34s]  Every object before my film runs out.
[27362.46s -> 27364.26s]  Select a teammate.
[27364.98s -> 27366.53s]  Oh, Jarrah.
[27367.49s -> 27392.30s]  It's not even my character.
[27392.30s -> 27392.54s]  What?
[27392.54s -> 27393.58s]  This is not even my character.
[27394.30s -> 27394.38s]  Why?
[27394.38s -> 27395.10s]  Why can't it be me?
[27396.14s -> 27400.50s]  I don't...
[27400.50s -> 27400.90s]  I don't...
[27400.90s -> 27401.46s]  This is...
[27401.46s -> 27402.42s]  He handles differently.
[27403.86s -> 27405.70s]  You can't make me toad the whole game
[27405.70s -> 27407.46s]  and then make me play as Donkey Kong
[27407.46s -> 27408.66s]  when I've never done that before.
[27465.15s -> 27465.87s]  He doesn't have the flush.
[27466.59s -> 27467.31s]  He doesn't have it.
[27468.03s -> 27485.95s]  I can do this.
[27485.95s -> 27486.67s]  I have four attempts.
[27487.39s -> 27489.28s]  You have four attempts to do
[27489.28s -> 27490.40s]  Big Spot Challenge.
[27491.36s -> 27491.60s]  Sure.
[27492.24s -> 27492.48s]  Let's go.
[27493.68s -> 27534.43s]  Oh, I got 13?
[27534.43s -> 27535.55s]  Not even close.
[27535.55s -> 27540.10s]  It's not even close.
[27540.10s -> 27541.86s]  I don't want to be bad much yet.
[27561.15s -> 27564.59s]  Come on.
[27565.31s -> 27566.59s]  24 out of 44.
[27571.79s -> 27572.11s]  Five.
[27574.75s -> 27578.59s]  How many more times?
[27585.47s -> 27587.07s]  You got to try to get it all in one line.
[27588.43s -> 27590.03s]  Or at least a lot of it in one line.
[27591.15s -> 27592.27s]  27 out of 44.
[27592.27s -> 27593.15s]  This is definitely doable.
[27594.43s -> 27595.23s]  In four attempts.
[27596.99s -> 27603.07s]  Definitely not going to be this one.
[27603.71s -> 27609.41s]  Yeah, that's it.
[27609.41s -> 27609.65s]  All right.
[27609.65s -> 27610.53s]  This is attempt number three.
[27612.35s -> 27613.15s]  Oh, no.
[27613.15s -> 27613.55s]  Fuck.
[27613.55s -> 27617.79s]  Oh, I just like literally dropped the ball.
[27618.75s -> 27622.85s]  All right.
[27631.84s -> 27632.56s]  All right.
[27632.56s -> 27647.81s]  Okay.
[27655.22s -> 27681.58s]  Go this way.
[27682.30s -> 27682.78s]  How many more?
[27684.06s -> 27706.53s]  27.
[27711.65s -> 27722.06s]  You got to do it all in one go?
[27723.18s -> 27723.90s]  Yeah, I know.
[27724.86s -> 27727.71s]  This is that's hard.
[27727.71s -> 27728.03s]  All right.
[27728.03s -> 27728.59s]  Try it again.
[27732.61s -> 27733.25s]  You don't have to.
[27733.25s -> 27733.65s]  I don't care.
[27734.29s -> 27735.82s]  You don't have to throw up your steak and cheese.
[27750.34s -> 27752.34s]  You get to keep it inside your stomach where it belongs.
[27761.87s -> 27762.11s]  No.
[27762.11s -> 27762.43s]  Okay.
[27762.43s -> 27764.03s]  I got to go up that ramp.
[27764.03s -> 27764.27s]  All right.
[27764.27s -> 27764.59s]  Let's go.
[27767.18s -> 27770.78s]  Take this.
[27773.06s -> 27774.82s]  I mean, yeah, but I didn't really do it.
[27775.54s -> 27785.18s]  Are they all like this?
[27785.18s -> 27786.86s]  Or is this one in particular just the one that's?
[27788.58s -> 27789.22s]  Is this this?
[27789.86s -> 27790.82s]  Are they all like this?
[27790.82s -> 27791.38s]  Every single one?
[27792.58s -> 27796.02s]  Or is this the I'm going to throw up the big challenge one?
[27797.79s -> 27798.83s]  This is the one.
[27798.83s -> 27799.87s]  This is the one that's hard.
[27800.83s -> 27802.02s]  Try it again.
[27802.82s -> 27803.30s]  One line.
[27804.34s -> 27823.52s]  Not bad.
[27823.52s -> 27824.48s]  Not a terrible start.
[27825.28s -> 27825.84s]  Could be worse.
[27826.48s -> 27843.02s]  Let's put a score and I touch that to grind it.
[27843.66s -> 27857.70s]  You got to learn it.
[27858.26s -> 27860.02s]  I mean, you got to learn the entire route.
[27861.06s -> 27863.66s]  Doing that in one trick.
[27863.66s -> 27865.58s]  I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere.
[27865.58s -> 27866.86s]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[27877.06s -> 27877.70s]  20.
[27877.70s -> 27880.53s]  A lot of shit over here.
[27881.33s -> 27901.46s]  30 out of 44.
[27902.02s -> 27905.44s]  Is it every single one or you just have to get 44?
[27905.44s -> 27907.04s]  Or is it all of them a 44?
[27915.63s -> 27916.83s]  All of them is 44.
[27918.98s -> 27924.11s]  Well, I don't think I'll be doing this one.
[27924.11s -> 27947.28s]  I'm not getting over there.
[27947.28s -> 27951.49s]  Nope.
[27951.49s -> 27952.13s]  Nope.
[27952.13s -> 27953.90s]  Nope.
[27953.90s -> 27956.48s]  Nope.
[27956.48s -> 27957.92s]  For this next part, I want to shoot this.
[27958.96s -> 27959.20s]  Wait.
[27960.24s -> 27960.48s]  What?
[27965.73s -> 27965.97s]  Wait.
[27966.85s -> 27968.43s]  I can't leave?
[27968.43s -> 27969.07s]  Why can't I?
[27969.07s -> 27969.47s]  There we go.
[27969.47s -> 27970.03s]  Change the level.
[27970.03s -> 27973.65s]  Get me out of here.
[27973.65s -> 27977.30s]  End goal.
[27977.30s -> 27977.86s]  Few goals.
[27977.86s -> 27978.10s]  Okay.
[27980.02s -> 27982.02s]  Jersey spine trick shot.
[27982.02s -> 27982.90s]  Apples.
[27982.90s -> 27983.62s]  Big apples.
[27983.62s -> 27984.58s]  I'm not there with that one.
[27985.54s -> 27992.53s]  How about slam a jamma?
[27992.53s -> 27995.04s]  Let's try slam a jamma.
[27998.46s -> 27998.94s]  Check it.
[27998.94s -> 28002.86s]  Peralta pulled some strings and got us onto the slam city course after hours.
[28003.98s -> 28007.10s]  This setup is perfect for a real street technician.
[28007.10s -> 28009.74s]  We should be able to shoot some nice long combo lines.
[28011.42s -> 28014.30s]  I've only got enough footage for a set number of lines.
[28014.30s -> 28016.94s]  So hit as many markers in one combo as you can.
[28032.22s -> 28040.29s]  I feel like this is going to be a significant portion of the rest of this stream.
[28041.81s -> 28054.11s]  Man, you have to do 10 combos.
[28055.36s -> 28056.48s]  You have nine combos.
[28057.20s -> 28057.84s]  I don't understand.
[28058.48s -> 28062.45s]  You have nine combos?
[28064.64s -> 28066.08s]  I only have to do...
[28066.08s -> 28066.56s]  I get it.
[28067.44s -> 28069.78s]  I have to do this in that...
[28073.54s -> 28073.78s]  No.
[28074.99s -> 28077.23s]  Oh, no.
[28077.23s -> 28079.95s]  Am I not going to be able to beat Tony Hawk's Underground?
[28081.66s -> 28084.38s]  I was hoping we were going to be at the last level after eight hours.
[28097.55s -> 28113.31s]  I'm sorry, Tony.
[28132.26s -> 28133.22s]  Let me see the other ones.
[28133.86s -> 28136.08s]  These are going to be so hard for me to do.
[28138.21s -> 28142.29s]  How about Vancouver spine challenge?
[28142.29s -> 28148.42s]  Those are the two hardest ones.
[28149.22s -> 28149.62s]  Are they?
[28159.14s -> 28166.38s]  Load, land, spine series.
[28172.30s -> 28174.94s]  Okay, land, spine series.
[28176.78s -> 28184.05s]  Okay, let's just spine over this.
[28185.92s -> 28186.64s]  Okay, there's one.
[28187.52s -> 28190.62s]  I would have had it.
[28190.62s -> 28191.66s]  This doesn't seem too bad.
[28195.86s -> 28199.65s]  Well, stop.
[28199.65s -> 28200.61s]  You're killing him.
[28213.31s -> 28214.96s]  Why can't I go forward?
[28215.92s -> 28217.20s]  What the fuck?
[28218.16s -> 28219.46s]  What am I doing wrong?
[28227.39s -> 28228.19s]  I need more air.
[28232.13s -> 28233.33s]  I had no air on that one.
[28238.32s -> 28239.04s]  I'm not holding anything.
[28239.04s -> 28240.56s]  I'm just doing L and R.
[28241.28s -> 28241.76s]  L and R.
[28242.40s -> 28254.35s]  Well, I get it.
[28254.35s -> 28254.75s]  I get it.
[28255.71s -> 28283.14s]  I'm starting to understand it, but fucking L and R is killing me.
[28283.14s -> 28284.74s]  Okay, L and R.
[28287.84s -> 28289.12s]  Give off as a controller.
[28289.76s -> 28306.91s]  The height of the jump?
[28306.91s -> 28307.79s]  I mean, all right.
[28307.79s -> 28310.43s]  So why am I doing the first one pretty much every single time,
[28310.43s -> 28311.47s]  but I can't do this one once?
[28312.75s -> 28322.82s]  I'm doing it too early?
[28323.62s -> 28324.34s]  Don't jump.
[28325.30s -> 28326.18s]  Wait, don't jump?
[28327.46s -> 28328.50s]  Why would I not?
[28328.50s -> 28329.54s]  Well, all right.
[28329.54s -> 28329.86s]  What?
[28329.86s -> 28330.34s]  What?
[28330.34s -> 28331.54s]  Why would I not jump?
[28341.34s -> 28342.54s]  Now score 100,000 points.
[28343.34s -> 28355.57s]  Now score 100,000 points.
[28356.53s -> 28358.00s]  Does it time?
[28359.04s -> 28359.81s]  Wait a minute.
[28359.81s -> 28360.53s]  What the fuck happened?
[28361.41s -> 28365.73s]  That whole...
[28365.73s -> 28367.73s]  Wait, the whole thing has to be a combo.
[28368.61s -> 28369.49s]  The entire thing.
[28372.48s -> 28373.76s]  Like from here down.
[28376.54s -> 28377.74s]  Oh, shit.
[28377.74s -> 28378.06s]  Okay.
[28379.26s -> 28380.22s]  Oh, boy.
[28380.22s -> 28382.78s]  I didn't really tacked on the fucking difficult shit
[28382.78s -> 28383.90s]  at the very end of the game, huh?
[28384.94s -> 28385.18s]  All right.
[28385.18s -> 28394.27s]  100,000.
[28394.83s -> 28395.63s]  I need a good line.
[28396.59s -> 28406.62s]  All right.
[28406.62s -> 28407.82s]  I'm not going to use Tony Hawk.
[28407.82s -> 28409.10s]  Who's got good street games?
[28434.22s -> 28435.98s]  Just do manual spam.
[28435.98s -> 28437.76s]  I'll still get off.
[28437.76s -> 28438.24s]  Hold on.
[28438.80s -> 28440.06s]  I'll try.
[28440.06s -> 28441.50s]  I'm going to try manual spam.
[28442.32s -> 28443.04s]  Oh, boy.
[28443.04s -> 28443.60s]  Here we go.
[28465.01s -> 28465.41s]  Different.
[28465.41s -> 28466.13s]  Do it with somebody else.
[28466.77s -> 28467.49s]  I don't want Tony Hawk.
[28469.86s -> 28470.82s]  Very patient car.
[28471.54s -> 28483.92s]  Tony Hawk?
[28483.92s -> 28486.24s]  I don't think has the best manual game.
[28486.24s -> 28494.22s]  The best game.
[28494.22s -> 28515.06s]  All right.
[28515.06s -> 28515.78s]  Let's get some manuals.
[28515.78s -> 28516.34s]  Here we go.
[28516.34s -> 28517.54s]  Three, two, one.
[28517.54s -> 28518.10s]  Start it.
[28518.10s -> 28545.01s]  Messed it up.
[28545.01s -> 28546.05s]  Same thing on the road.
[28546.05s -> 28546.77s]  All right.
[28546.77s -> 28547.25s]  Let's go.
[28547.97s -> 28559.09s]  There it is.
[28559.09s -> 28559.65s]  All right.
[28559.65s -> 28561.49s]  Jesus Christ.
[28561.49s -> 28566.94s]  Okay.
[28566.94s -> 28568.14s]  I need to do four more.
[28568.14s -> 28570.38s]  Hawaii Huge Spine Challenge.
[28570.38s -> 28570.94s]  Oh, no.
[28570.94s -> 28571.10s]  No.
[28571.10s -> 28573.41s]  Why does it have to be spine every time?
[28573.41s -> 28574.61s]  No spines.
[28574.61s -> 28576.45s]  I don't want to do spines.
[28576.45s -> 28580.53s]  The leap of faith's got nothing on this spy.
[28580.53s -> 28581.81s]  Roll off the end of the hotel
[28581.81s -> 28583.89s]  and acid drop to the quarter pipe below.
[28584.85s -> 28585.54s]  Okay.
[28586.26s -> 28588.26s]  Use that speed to spine up to the far roof
[28588.26s -> 28590.98s]  and then hit the next two spines in a row.
[28590.98s -> 28592.66s]  Who's got the nuts to try it?
[28595.12s -> 28596.80s]  You don't look like you're going fast enough to do this.
[28597.92s -> 28598.48s]  Tony Hawk.
[28599.44s -> 28607.36s]  All right.
[28607.36s -> 28608.00s]  Acid drop.
[28616.78s -> 28617.58s]  This one's kind of fun.
[28619.33s -> 28619.97s]  Acid drop.
[28620.77s -> 28628.46s]  Do it.
[28628.46s -> 28633.71s]  Just jump over.
[28634.51s -> 28640.78s]  Got it.
[28641.58s -> 28642.74s]  Now what?
[28643.46s -> 28644.24s]  Spine?
[28644.24s -> 28644.80s]  Now what?
[28644.80s -> 28647.52s]  The spine of acid drop before we move the first hotel spines
[28647.52s -> 28648.32s]  before time runs out.
[28648.32s -> 28649.12s]  Did I not do four?
[28650.16s -> 28658.67s]  Just a little one right here.
[28659.39s -> 28663.71s]  Why would that be part of it?
[28664.75s -> 28665.79s]  That's it.
[28665.79s -> 28673.23s]  Okay.
[28673.23s -> 28675.63s]  Florida Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Challenge.
[28676.19s -> 28682.64s]  Okay.
[28682.64s -> 28683.28s]  500,000 points.
[28683.28s -> 28684.56s]  Cool concept for someone's part.
[28684.56s -> 28686.32s]  Let's do it video game style.
[28686.32s -> 28688.48s]  We'll shoot four sick combo lines.
[28689.60s -> 28692.85s]  First combo, you can use whatever you want.
[28692.85s -> 28694.85s]  Next, only Tony Hawk three stuff.
[28694.85s -> 28696.29s]  No spine transfers.
[28696.29s -> 28698.13s]  Then only Tony Hawk two stuff.
[28698.13s -> 28699.81s]  No reverts or spine transfer.
[28699.81s -> 28700.61s]  I don't use them anyways.
[28700.61s -> 28702.77s]  Finally, only Tony Hawk one trick.
[28703.25s -> 28704.13s]  No manuals.
[28705.97s -> 28707.01s]  No manuals.
[28710.29s -> 28710.61s]  All right.
[28711.65s -> 28712.77s]  How about Van Margera?
[28714.85s -> 28715.41s]  30,000.
[28716.77s -> 28717.09s]  Okay.
[28717.09s -> 28718.53s]  Well, I didn't know we were going to go right now.
[28719.81s -> 28728.30s]  Okay.
[28729.98s -> 28756.02s]  Now no cat puke.
[28760.13s -> 28761.49s]  I'm just going to manual the first two.
[28764.18s -> 28764.82s]  All right.
[28764.82s -> 28766.74s]  Van Margera is not very good at manuals.
[28766.74s -> 28768.26s]  Maybe I shouldn't do that.
[28768.90s -> 28769.46s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[28769.46s -> 28770.34s]  I don't want, I'm going to save him.
[28771.86s -> 28776.00s]  Van Margera.
[28776.72s -> 28779.02s]  You said like BAM sucks?
[28779.82s -> 28788.59s]  I'm trying to get over it.
[28788.59s -> 28790.11s]  BAM's not good at anything.
[28790.11s -> 28791.23s]  Why don't I pick them?
[28791.23s -> 28791.47s]  What?
[28792.19s -> 28802.14s]  There's 68,000.
[28802.14s -> 28802.30s]  All right.
[28802.30s -> 28802.86s]  Let's do that again.
[28808.08s -> 28808.32s]  Man.
[28809.86s -> 28810.26s]  All right.
[28810.26s -> 28815.74s]  I'm going to have to, I can do that.
[28815.74s -> 28816.22s]  I can do it.
[28816.22s -> 28816.70s]  I can do it.
[28816.70s -> 28818.14s]  I'm not going to, I'm not going to rely on manuals.
[28818.78s -> 28819.66s]  Just for the first one, I will.
[28820.38s -> 28821.42s]  And did you see what just happened?
[28822.14s -> 28823.18s]  Magnet just grabbed that.
[28836.37s -> 28836.69s]  Okay.
[28836.69s -> 28837.49s]  Let's just do tricks.
[28860.98s -> 28862.98s]  Out of bounds game.
[28862.98s -> 28872.78s]  I got to do it with BAM.
[28872.78s -> 28873.18s]  I have to.
[28881.54s -> 28882.10s]  Did I fall?
[28895.54s -> 28896.26s]  Let's try that again.
[28898.26s -> 28899.62s]  Manuals really are the way to do it.
[28899.62s -> 28900.42s]  It seriously is.
[28902.18s -> 28902.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[28912.14s -> 28912.86s]  Okay.
[28912.86s -> 28913.10s]  Now.
[28914.54s -> 28915.66s]  No manuals.
[28922.03s -> 28922.75s]  Damn it.
[28922.75s -> 28923.47s]  I thought I had it.
[28924.35s -> 28928.59s]  Manuals are allowed?
[28928.59s -> 28928.83s]  Wait.
[28930.53s -> 28931.57s]  That was the third time though, right?
[28931.57s -> 28933.49s]  Was it a Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 1?
[28943.54s -> 28944.18s]  Four of them, bro.
[28945.78s -> 28948.18s]  It's a normal Tony Hawk 3, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 1.
[28987.97s -> 28988.29s]  All right.
[28989.17s -> 28989.81s]  This is the one.
[28990.69s -> 28992.29s]  No manual, right?
[28992.29s -> 28994.93s]  This is no reverts, spine transfers, or walking.
[28995.81s -> 28996.77s]  This is the last one, right?
[29000.14s -> 29001.26s]  Can I still manual here?
[29002.06s -> 29004.43s]  Just infinite grind.
[29004.99s -> 29006.03s]  Just grind in a circle.
[29007.55s -> 29009.63s]  But where, I don't know where that line is, man.
[29010.51s -> 29011.39s]  Grind in a circle?
[29014.21s -> 29016.13s]  Oh, why did you guys even say that?
[29016.85s -> 29032.48s]  The tree thing?
[29033.84s -> 29044.02s]  The road median.
[29054.98s -> 29055.62s]  That's not good.
[29059.14s -> 29061.30s]  Right, right, right to my right.
[29061.30s -> 29061.80s]  Okay.
[29063.30s -> 29064.02s]  Forever grind.
[29065.06s -> 29077.87s]  This is fun though.
[29079.76s -> 29080.64s]  I like it.
[29080.64s -> 29082.96s]  It's hard, but it's not too hard for me to not be like,
[29082.96s -> 29083.92s]  I don't think I can do this.
[29087.50s -> 29091.58s]  All right.
[29091.58s -> 29092.38s]  I turned the wrong way.
[29095.79s -> 29098.75s]  It's fucking hard, but it's not like I can't do it.
[29099.47s -> 29100.35s]  I'll do it eventually.
[29101.23s -> 29105.17s]  Imagine this on stick.
[29106.13s -> 29122.03s]  Shit, I went off the side.
[29123.07s -> 29125.28s]  This is the least fun part of the game.
[29127.06s -> 29127.56s]  Yeah.
[29128.10s -> 29128.74s]  Yeah, it is.
[29129.38s -> 29130.58s]  It's still good though.
[29130.58s -> 29131.14s]  It's still fun.
[29132.02s -> 29137.84s]  It's still fun.
[29137.84s -> 29141.23s]  I mean, it makes you have to play well.
[29142.91s -> 29144.11s]  Did you learn anything, you know?
[29144.11s -> 29146.11s]  Did you learn whatever the game's trying to teach you?
[29147.31s -> 29151.79s]  It's good if you're good at the game.
[29152.59s -> 29155.60s]  Yeah, sure.
[29166.66s -> 29167.78s]  Times 13?
[29167.78s -> 29168.50s]  That's not, no.
[29171.26s -> 29172.54s]  Isn't that usually the case?
[29175.31s -> 29177.87s]  To get good at something, don't you have to do it
[29177.87s -> 29179.39s]  and play it and do it for a while?
[29180.35s -> 29181.62s]  How do you get good at anything?
[29185.02s -> 29187.02s]  You don't just start good at something.
[29187.02s -> 29187.92s]  That's not how it works.
[29188.48s -> 29201.74s]  I played all the Tony Hawk games.
[29202.46s -> 29202.96s]  Yes.
[29203.82s -> 29204.38s]  Yes, I did.
[29205.50s -> 29206.86s]  20 years ago.
[29206.86s -> 29211.09s]  And we did Tony Hawk 2 on the Dreamcast a year ago.
[29217.44s -> 29219.28s]  Yes, I've played all these games before.
[29220.24s -> 29222.32s]  Oh, when I was 17.
[29237.39s -> 29238.75s]  Okay, let's go.
[29239.63s -> 29240.11s]  The tree.
[29241.34s -> 29241.84s]  That's it.
[29247.07s -> 29250.82s]  Guys, this is a bad idea.
[29251.98s -> 29253.50s]  This is a very bad idea.
[29253.50s -> 29254.70s]  With Bam Margera?
[29260.13s -> 29261.25s]  Wait, do spam tricks?
[29261.81s -> 29262.93s]  What do you mean spam tricks?
[29265.81s -> 29282.86s]  Wait, what?
[29282.86s -> 29284.14s]  Wait, while you're grinding, I can do,
[29284.14s -> 29285.58s]  I can hold like X and Y and...
[29289.63s -> 29291.47s]  Oh man, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that shit.
[29292.27s -> 29297.12s]  I don't know if Bam can handle that.
[29297.12s -> 29309.66s]  I guess, okay, I can.
[29309.66s -> 29310.54s]  I can do it.
[29310.54s -> 29311.04s]  All right.
[29311.50s -> 29312.76s]  I can do it.
[29320.19s -> 29320.99s]  All right, I can do it.
[29321.87s -> 29323.78s]  I'll do it on the next run.
[29324.42s -> 29325.46s]  I have to get there again, though.
[29326.10s -> 29337.94s]  I don't know if Bam can handle this.
[29337.94s -> 29343.30s]  Just do something!
[29343.30s -> 29344.34s]  Do something!
[29344.34s -> 29366.19s]  Here we go.
[29366.19s -> 29366.83s]  Go.
[29366.83s -> 29388.94s]  San Diego Transfer Challenge.
[29398.69s -> 29399.33s]  Fuck you.
[29399.33s -> 29401.01s]  No one's ever shot at San Diego like this before.
[29401.01s -> 29401.49s]  Fuck you.
[29401.49s -> 29404.21s]  I've got filmers spread all across Balboa Park.
[29404.21s -> 29405.17s]  Is that how the song goes?
[29406.29s -> 29410.22s]  We just need a burly vert dog to try and hit all the transfers we've set up.
[29410.94s -> 29411.44s]  Okay.
[29412.14s -> 29413.42s]  Uh, Boston.
[29413.42s -> 29413.92s]  No.
[29415.10s -> 29417.30s]  Who has good air?
[29417.30s -> 29418.34s]  Boston versus Musco?
[29420.34s -> 29424.70s]  Probably Musco.
[29428.13s -> 29428.63s]  Neither.
[29433.60s -> 29435.44s]  Transvert transfer photoshoot.
[29435.44s -> 29436.08s]  No, I can do this.
[29437.04s -> 29437.76s]  Just hold R.
[29438.48s -> 29439.04s]  Or hit R.
[29439.84s -> 29441.70s]  Okay, there's one.
[29442.26s -> 29442.90s]  How many are there?
[29444.96s -> 29445.46s]  Over there.
[29456.00s -> 29457.12s]  He's praying for me.
[29458.48s -> 29462.63s]  Okay.
[29462.63s -> 29464.40s]  More of this way.
[29467.58s -> 29468.54s]  No, there isn't.
[29468.54s -> 29472.02s]  He's taking a picture to laugh at you.
[29472.74s -> 29474.14s]  Funny LML comedy.
[29474.14s -> 29475.10s]  Fucking comedy moment.
[29475.98s -> 29480.83s]  A little too far.
[29484.16s -> 29484.96s]  I still got it?
[29484.96s -> 29485.46s]  I got it.
[29486.08s -> 29487.63s]  Fuck you, buddy.
[29489.54s -> 29490.90s]  You're in Tony Hawk's way.
[29491.70s -> 29493.59s]  Wait.
[29493.59s -> 29494.21s]  Oh, do I have to...
[29494.77s -> 29503.44s]  Come on.
[29504.30s -> 29506.46s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[29506.46s -> 29507.90s]  Matthew McConaughey is on his way.
[29509.02s -> 29510.53s]  I got it.
[29511.15s -> 29513.23s]  Not very good, but I still got it.
[29514.03s -> 29528.67s]  Okay, let me just slow down and do this the way it should be done.
[29531.54s -> 29532.04s]  Okay.
[29545.63s -> 29548.19s]  Uh, so how bad is Causton's air again?
[29548.19s -> 29548.75s]  Somebody said.
[29576.86s -> 29577.36s]  Here?
[29577.90s -> 29583.70s]  Over here?
[29584.32s -> 29588.45s]  I don't see anything over here.
[29595.86s -> 29596.66s]  They're on the roof?
[29597.38s -> 29597.88s]  No.
[29601.68s -> 29602.48s]  Wait, what about in here?
[29603.76s -> 29606.75s]  I mean, that could be one.
[29606.75s -> 29607.25s]  Oh.
[29618.82s -> 29619.32s]  This one?
[29621.73s -> 29623.42s]  It's not up here.
[29623.42s -> 29623.98s]  Yeah, this...
[29623.98s -> 29624.70s]  Where else would it be?
[29626.14s -> 29644.51s]  Over here?
[29644.51s -> 29651.92s]  Oh, there's one over here.
[29651.92s -> 29652.56s]  Only one?
[29653.52s -> 29662.77s]  There's a corner one.
[29663.57s -> 29668.72s]  What is...
[29670.62s -> 29672.06s]  I haven't even seen what the hell I'm supposed to be doing.
[29672.06s -> 29673.74s]  You want me to go from here to here?
[29675.28s -> 29676.16s]  Wait, what does he want me to do?
[29682.94s -> 29683.44s]  Over the...
[29686.22s -> 29687.18s]  Up on the roof.
[29687.90s -> 29688.90s]  Oh.
[29689.62s -> 29690.50s]  Over the roof.
[29692.29s -> 29693.01s]  Well, shit.
[29693.01s -> 29693.51s]  Okay.
[29720.21s -> 29720.71s]  In here?
[29722.83s -> 29723.87s]  We'll just delete the cars.
[29726.54s -> 29727.34s]  Three stair ones.
[29728.06s -> 29748.20s]  Okay.
[29749.06s -> 29750.10s]  There's another one back here.
[29750.90s -> 29754.30s]  And I've skated by it.
[29771.07s -> 29771.57s]  Okay.
[29773.02s -> 29774.70s]  Now, go up on the roof.
[29776.53s -> 29777.33s]  Over back here.
[29778.54s -> 29779.04s]  Good.
[29779.58s -> 29782.74s]  Was there one?
[29782.74s -> 29783.62s]  Wait, is there one over here?
[29784.50s -> 29785.89s]  I don't think I looked over here.
[29786.61s -> 29804.78s]  What does he mean?
[29804.78s -> 29805.50s]  He misused it.
[29806.54s -> 29812.61s]  What the hell are you trying to do?
[29812.61s -> 29813.01s]  All right.
[29813.01s -> 29813.73s]  Over the roof?
[29814.45s -> 29817.50s]  Over the roof?
[29818.99s -> 29820.59s]  Just a spine transfer?
[29821.47s -> 29838.21s]  From here to there?
[29841.23s -> 29842.11s]  Through the opening?
[29842.91s -> 29851.20s]  Ram.
[29851.74s -> 29853.15s]  Not a spine transfer.
[29853.15s -> 29854.67s]  Yeah, you're supposed to go from bird to bird.
[29855.87s -> 29856.35s]  This one?
[29856.35s -> 29857.23s]  Like, from here to here?
[29858.83s -> 29859.63s]  It's probably that one.
[29860.27s -> 29867.82s]  He's not even aiming the camera over here.
[29869.82s -> 29872.75s]  Is there one on the other side?
[29873.47s -> 29889.70s]  I don't get it.
[29891.62s -> 29892.74s]  The roof has a ramp.
[29893.78s -> 29894.28s]  What is it?
[29895.06s -> 29895.78s]  Like, here?
[29897.06s -> 29897.86s]  Oh, okay.
[29897.86s -> 29898.34s]  That.
[29898.34s -> 29898.82s]  I see.
[29898.82s -> 29899.94s]  All right, all right, all right.
[29899.94s -> 29900.58s]  So I have to go.
[29901.54s -> 29901.94s]  Now I know.
[29904.98s -> 29911.22s]  Wasn't it?
[29911.92s -> 29914.38s]  Wait.
[29914.38s -> 29915.10s]  How is that not it?
[29915.82s -> 29922.05s]  Other side?
[29923.01s -> 29927.89s]  So you want me to come up from that side?
[29927.89s -> 29928.39s]  Okay.
[29935.98s -> 29936.48s]  This side.
[29940.38s -> 29941.18s]  I know where it is now.
[29950.13s -> 29951.73s]  Well, I killed the photographer.
[29952.53s -> 29966.00s]  There's one.
[29967.87s -> 29968.91s]  That still doesn't solve the problem.
[29968.91s -> 29970.35s]  There's this two more somewhere.
[29973.22s -> 29975.54s]  Where on earth are the last two that I haven't seen?
[29989.60s -> 30002.58s]  I didn't do the first one?
[30002.58s -> 30003.08s]  That's bad.
[30003.08s -> 30004.26s]  I can go back and get it.
[30011.84s -> 30012.96s]  I'm going to call a legend.
[30012.96s -> 30016.18s]  Dominance before it gives me a warm reception.
[30016.18s -> 30017.38s]  Double war with weapons.
[30017.38s -> 30018.40s]  Give me shit.
[30018.40s -> 30019.20s]  Throw him the sword.
[30019.20s -> 30020.24s]  Dust him just as well.
[30020.24s -> 30025.55s]  That fucking car.
[30025.55s -> 30026.67s]  No, that fucked that car.
[30030.83s -> 30031.87s]  Fuck that car.
[30031.87s -> 30033.23s]  That ruined everything.
[30033.23s -> 30034.03s]  Unless I can get this one.
[30042.16s -> 30042.66s]  Eww.
[30043.36s -> 30051.49s]  How did there be a mission here?
[30051.49s -> 30051.99s]  I don't know.
[30061.12s -> 30062.19s]  I'm going to fall again.
[30063.15s -> 30067.17s]  Should I just do it?
[30080.19s -> 30080.75s]  All right.
[30080.75s -> 30083.15s]  Now go this way.
[30083.87s -> 30084.43s]  Up and in?
[30085.47s -> 30092.46s]  These guys are going to have a bad day.
[30092.46s -> 30093.82s]  I did it?
[30093.82s -> 30094.78s]  Did he get the photo?
[30095.74s -> 30096.54s]  Did he get the photo?
[30099.20s -> 30099.92s]  Okay.
[30099.92s -> 30100.42s]  He got it.
[30101.12s -> 30105.63s]  Now where are the last?
[30105.63s -> 30106.67s]  I know one back there I didn't do.
[30106.67s -> 30107.87s]  But where are the last two?
[30108.51s -> 30110.70s]  Is that a photographer?
[30111.42s -> 30121.10s]  Up here?
[30122.14s -> 30126.42s]  Let's just spine up here.
[30135.04s -> 30135.68s]  Shit.
[30135.68s -> 30136.56s]  I see one there.
[30137.28s -> 30138.00s]  There's nobody here.
[30138.64s -> 30143.02s]  There's one up there though.
[30143.02s -> 30149.98s]  Where did I see that?
[30149.98s -> 30152.77s]  Isn't that like up there?
[30155.17s -> 30174.47s]  Yeah.
[30181.12s -> 30190.53s]  I gotta get up here.
[30191.41s -> 30195.31s]  So I need just a view.
[30196.27s -> 30204.06s]  Is one in there?
[30204.06s -> 30204.46s]  All right.
[30204.46s -> 30204.96s]  In there.
[30205.58s -> 30208.34s]  Wasn't I in here already?
[30209.06s -> 30212.43s]  Oh, this motherfucker is right here.
[30213.55s -> 30214.11s]  Oh, man.
[30214.11s -> 30214.91s]  They're both right here.
[30218.21s -> 30218.85s]  All right.
[30218.85s -> 30219.57s]  Let's go.
[30219.57s -> 30224.05s]  That's too bad.
[30224.05s -> 30225.73s]  There's no ramp on that side.
[30226.77s -> 30228.29s]  No ramp on that side.
[30228.29s -> 30229.25s]  Just take it slow.
[30230.85s -> 30234.02s]  I did it.
[30237.82s -> 30238.32s]  Last one.
[30240.61s -> 30242.85s]  Jersey spine trick spot challenge.
[30242.85s -> 30244.53s]  Big apple spot challenge.
[30245.33s -> 30247.89s]  Slam a jam of Moscow's lost tapes.
[30248.61s -> 30251.41s]  I'm not going to be able to do it.
[30251.41s -> 30252.77s]  No, there's no way.
[30252.77s -> 30253.81s]  I'm not capable of that.
[30257.81s -> 30260.05s]  Who wants to leave his mark on red square?
[30260.05s -> 30261.41s]  There's no way I'll do big apple.
[30261.41s -> 30262.05s]  I'm sorry.
[30262.05s -> 30263.25s]  This is not going to happen.
[30266.61s -> 30268.05s]  Those ledges are rough.
[30268.05s -> 30269.73s]  So make sure you warm up before you go.
[30271.09s -> 30271.81s]  All right, Muska.
[30272.53s -> 30273.09s]  Ten tapes.
[30274.29s -> 30282.26s]  I feel like Muska doesn't have very good grind.
[30289.63s -> 30290.13s]  Oh, boy.
[30290.99s -> 30304.21s]  What would that even happen?
[30336.02s -> 30338.42s]  Don't tell me what.
[30338.42s -> 30339.70s]  You can't come in here with that.
[30340.26s -> 30341.30s]  Don't tell him what.
[30341.94s -> 30343.30s]  Why you can't come in here with that?
[30345.28s -> 30345.68s]  What is it?
[30345.68s -> 30346.48s]  Why are you saying that?
[30347.04s -> 30359.18s]  He doesn't know.
[30359.98s -> 30360.86s]  I mean, I do.
[30361.74s -> 30365.28s]  How do I look at a character's stats?
[30365.28s -> 30379.46s]  Oh, no.
[30398.66s -> 30410.40s]  This buster.
[30420.42s -> 30421.46s]  He's not good for this.
[30422.74s -> 30424.18s]  What was slam a jam on again?
[30424.18s -> 30424.68s]  No.
[30425.22s -> 30425.54s]  What?
[30425.54s -> 30427.46s]  Jersey spine trick spot challenge.
[30427.46s -> 30428.34s]  I didn't even look at this one.
[30428.90s -> 30436.96s]  Peralta was right.
[30436.96s -> 30438.96s]  This old spine is a big ghetto,
[30438.96s -> 30441.20s]  but it'll definitely turn heads if one of you guys can get.
[30441.20s -> 30443.44s]  I mean, he is sideways tricks as you go over it
[30443.44s -> 30445.76s]  and we'll have a killer part to lead off the team video.
[30447.36s -> 30447.60s]  All right.
[30447.60s -> 30448.56s]  What do we need to do?
[30448.56s -> 30450.72s]  Hit the tricks over the train station spine.
[30460.18s -> 30480.13s]  Wait, I guess there's a secret level over there.
[30480.85s -> 30491.49s]  Look at that.
[30491.49s -> 30498.08s]  Look at that.
[30498.08s -> 30499.97s]  This is going to be it.
[30499.97s -> 30504.00s]  That's it.
[30504.94s -> 30506.06s]  Oh, I did it.
[30506.06s -> 30506.78s]  I did it.
[30507.74s -> 30510.46s]  I beat Tony Hawk's pro skater underground.
[30511.18s -> 30512.96s]  But that didn't work.
[30527.15s -> 30528.35s]  I can't even say, like,
[30530.43s -> 30531.79s]  I don't know how it goes that fast.
[30535.18s -> 30536.86s]  Once you do it fast enough, stop.
[30537.58s -> 30544.64s]  Let's take a look at our sick video, man.
[30546.29s -> 30547.41s]  Blush force video.
[30549.41s -> 30551.57s]  I'm Chad Muska.
[30552.37s -> 30562.19s]  Oh, sick.
[30562.19s -> 30563.31s]  And then we took that photo.
[30564.43s -> 30566.18s]  Nice, Tony.
[30566.98s -> 30574.58s]  Sick.
[30578.02s -> 30580.02s]  Oh, that was clean.
[30586.08s -> 30593.28s]  Oh, yeah.
[30594.08s -> 30598.51s]  Now do the thing where you fall forward on the front part of your neck
[30598.51s -> 30600.35s]  and your legs kick you in the back of the head.
[30600.99s -> 30602.35s]  We've got a lot of footage of that.
[30602.91s -> 30603.87s]  Did the editor put it in?
[30608.27s -> 30608.91s]  Eric Costin.
[30608.91s -> 30609.31s]  Let's see it.
[30609.95s -> 30617.44s]  That shit is so hard.
[30617.44s -> 30618.96s]  It's so difficult to do this stuff.
[30619.68s -> 30625.89s]  That's beautiful.
[30625.89s -> 30630.45s]  That was a manual all the way.
[30635.65s -> 30636.77s]  Skateboarding's fun to watch.
[30639.01s -> 30643.01s]  Yeah, it's just, it's a craft.
[30643.01s -> 30643.81s]  It's an art form.
[30648.96s -> 30649.28s]  Wow.
[30650.24s -> 30651.57s]  No fucking way.
[30652.13s -> 30656.45s]  All right, bam.
[30656.45s -> 30656.85s]  Let's see it.
[30657.89s -> 30658.77s]  Oh, there we go.
[30660.91s -> 30661.23s]  Yep.
[30661.23s -> 30663.23s]  This is where all that footage went.
[30663.23s -> 30669.07s]  It just like falls down.
[30669.07s -> 30672.08s]  Accurate replay.
[30672.08s -> 30677.78s]  Remember when I rode the ATV?
[30677.78s -> 30679.78s]  Oh, shit there.
[30679.78s -> 30687.01s]  Remember when I drove the car like that?
[30687.01s -> 30696.10s]  Nice.
[30696.10s -> 30699.68s]  You know how much that hurts your back?
[30699.68s -> 30704.16s]  Planting from that high.
[30704.16s -> 30713.82s]  Do I get one too?
[30713.82s -> 30719.52s]  You've got to be kidding me.
[30719.52s -> 30722.85s]  That was phenomenal.
[30722.85s -> 30724.85s]  How do humans do this?
[30724.85s -> 30733.36s]  How do humans do this?
[30733.36s -> 30735.36s]  All right, this dude is a video game.
[30735.36s -> 30738.88s]  Actual video game character right here.
[30738.88s -> 30757.63s]  Cardi Mullen is the greatest of all time in the street.
[30757.63s -> 30760.13s]  Holy shit, that was awesome.
[30760.13s -> 30762.13s]  I just kind of wanted to watch these.
[30762.13s -> 30764.13s]  I just want to watch skateboarding videos now.
[30764.13s -> 30782.05s]  You can just do those little transfers over.
[30782.05s -> 30784.05s]  Little railings.
[30784.05s -> 30787.50s]  This shit is so dangerous.
[30787.50s -> 30791.50s]  But completely captivating at the same time.
[30791.50s -> 30797.12s]  Uh oh.
[30797.12s -> 30799.12s]  Illegal picnic basket jump.
[30817.49s -> 30823.57s]  Here comes my video.
[30823.57s -> 30825.57s]  I saw him do a royal flush and he got arrested.
[30843.89s -> 30845.89s]  You blew every cent you own on that car.
[30845.89s -> 30847.89s]  That was a mistake.
[30866.62s -> 30868.62s]  Cigarettes?
[30868.62s -> 30870.62s]  Oh, my cassette tape.
[30876.62s -> 30878.62s]  What do you say?
[30878.62s -> 30880.62s]  One last trip around the neighborhood.
[30880.62s -> 30883.25s]  Winner takes the tape.
[30883.25s -> 30885.55s]  All right, one last trip.
[30885.55s -> 30887.55s]  I've waited a long time for this.
[30887.55s -> 30889.55s]  I'm gonna light you up.
[30889.55s -> 30891.55s]  I'm gonna light you up, homie.
[30893.92s -> 30902.11s]  Oh, boy.
[30902.11s -> 30905.44s]  Why does he have to fire?
[30905.44s -> 30907.44s]  He's throwing, like, grenades at me.
[30907.44s -> 30920.69s]  That's not fair. I don't get grenades.
[30920.69s -> 30922.69s]  Oh, shit!
[30922.69s -> 30924.69s]  He's up top.
[30924.69s -> 30944.98s]  He's up top.
[30944.98s -> 30952.34s]  He's got a hit. Jump over it.
[30952.34s -> 30957.33s]  Hit the line.
[30962.58s -> 30965.52s]  He's fucking schooling me right now.
[30965.52s -> 30973.78s]  I mean, but...
[30973.78s -> 30981.07s]  This is gonna be rough.
[30981.07s -> 30994.50s]  Two hours later.
[30994.50s -> 30996.50s]  I kinda hope not.
[30996.50s -> 30998.50s]  It's really just the end of the game.
[30998.50s -> 31000.50s]  I'm trying to jump through those.
[31000.50s -> 31002.50s]  It's giving me a lot of trouble.
[31004.50s -> 31006.50s]  Why does he have Molotov?
[31006.50s -> 31008.50s]  Molotov?
[31010.50s -> 31012.50s]  That's a great question.
[31012.50s -> 31014.50s]  To make this
[31014.50s -> 31016.50s]  already difficult
[31016.50s -> 31018.50s]  way more difficult.
[31018.50s -> 31020.50s]  Something like that.
[31029.70s -> 31031.70s]  I'm gonna stop getting off that.
[31031.70s -> 31033.70s]  All right, here we go.
[31035.70s -> 31037.70s]  Here we go.
[31039.70s -> 31044.56s]  Jesus Christ!
[31044.56s -> 31046.74s]  What? Oh, no!
[31046.74s -> 31055.89s]  The power lines.
[31055.89s -> 31064.85s]  I don't think I can even get up there anymore.
[31064.85s -> 31069.84s]  Hold on. Time for that one.
[31069.84s -> 31071.84s]  Not even halfway there, either.
[31071.84s -> 31076.58s]  Two minutes, too.
[31076.58s -> 31088.22s]  I'd stay up here.
[31088.22s -> 31096.27s]  Did I not get it?
[31096.27s -> 31098.27s]  Yeah, I can't get this part down.
[31098.27s -> 31100.27s]  I could jump through.
[31100.27s -> 31102.27s]  Where does he jump? He jumps right here.
[31102.27s -> 31111.74s]  He hits me like that every time.
[31111.74s -> 31113.92s]  Rhythm Heaven?
[31113.92s -> 31115.92s]  This is probably...
[31115.92s -> 31117.92s]  I would probably put this...
[31117.92s -> 31127.90s]  This is probably harder than Rhythm Heaven. Did I not get it?
[31127.90s -> 31129.90s]  I don't think I got that one.
[31129.90s -> 31139.94s]  No, I didn't.
[31139.94s -> 31158.50s]  All right, save.
[31158.50s -> 31160.50s]  I'm just gonna try to stay with him.
[31160.50s -> 31162.93s]  I could jump over it, too.
[31162.93s -> 31169.65s]  The whole screen.
[31169.65s -> 31176.24s]  As long as you're in the vicinity, you get it.
[31176.24s -> 31179.12s]  Here he goes. Didn't get it.
[31179.12s -> 31182.43s]  Oh, man.
[31182.43s -> 31186.27s]  This might...
[31186.27s -> 31188.27s]  I'm not sure a nine-hour stream Jeremy can beat this level.
[31188.27s -> 31191.34s]  I'm not sure this is gonna happen.
[31191.34s -> 31193.58s]  I don't know if a nine-hour stream Jeremy can complete this.
[31193.58s -> 31195.58s]  I'll try for another 30 minutes or so.
[31195.58s -> 31202.75s]  Let's see if I can get it.
[31202.75s -> 31211.26s]  Watch out.
[31211.26s -> 31221.57s]  Up the wall.
[31221.57s -> 31223.57s]  I think it's over.
[31223.57s -> 31228.37s]  Unless I can stay...
[31228.37s -> 31235.79s]  It's hard to see the wires.
[31235.79s -> 31241.04s]  The wires are almost just blended with the background.
[31241.04s -> 31243.04s]  I can't even see them.
[31243.04s -> 31245.04s]  Level up my stats.
[31245.04s -> 31249.01s]  Where are all my stats?
[31249.01s -> 31251.01s]  I can't even see them.
[31251.01s -> 31254.34s]  Air spin. They're all really good.
[31254.34s -> 31258.11s]  Run, flip, ray.
[31258.11s -> 31260.11s]  Actually, rail is really not that good.
[31260.11s -> 31262.11s]  Crying for 15 seconds.
[31262.11s -> 31264.11s]  Crying for 20 seconds.
[31264.11s -> 31269.49s]  Crying for 20 seconds.
[31269.49s -> 31271.49s]  Haven't done that yet.
[31271.49s -> 31279.23s]  No, I got it.
[31279.23s -> 31301.04s]  I...
[31301.04s -> 31303.04s]  I mean, I'm gonna try.
[31303.04s -> 31311.30s]  And when he abandoned you in Russia...
[31311.30s -> 31313.30s]  I do. It was bad.
[31313.30s -> 31332.62s]  Yeah.
[31332.62s -> 31334.62s]  I think nine hours straight Tony Hawk Jeremy.
[31334.62s -> 31336.80s]  I think it's time to go to bed, son.
[31336.80s -> 31338.80s]  You've been up all day playing Tony Hawk, son.
[31338.80s -> 31340.80s]  You can beat the last level another time.
[31340.80s -> 31342.80s]  You've been up all day playing Tony Hawk, son.
[31342.80s -> 31345.23s]  You can beat the last level another time.
[31345.23s -> 31347.23s]  No, I can do it. I can do it, dad.
[31347.23s -> 31351.63s]  Son, it's okay.
[31351.63s -> 31354.70s]  You don't have to beat it right now.
[31354.70s -> 31362.62s]  I missed.
[31362.62s -> 31373.38s]  Shut up, dad.
[31373.38s -> 31375.38s]  Are you your own dad?
[31375.38s -> 31380.93s]  It'd be odd, wouldn't it?
[31380.93s -> 31382.93s]  This is the part that I get caught up on every time.
[31382.93s -> 31385.30s]  Up, and then drive?
[31385.30s -> 31388.56s]  Drive? No.
[31388.56s -> 31390.56s]  The worst thing is if you miss it,
[31390.56s -> 31393.70s]  it's just over.
[31393.70s -> 31396.64s]  Turn the music off.
[31396.64s -> 31402.08s]  Alright, I'm gonna try it without music.
[31402.08s -> 31417.31s]  Just skateboard sounds.
[31417.31s -> 31419.31s]  I'm just trying not to do any tricks.
[31419.31s -> 31423.54s]  I'm just trying to grind and just stay...
[31423.54s -> 31425.54s]  I'm not trying to do anything fancy.
[31425.54s -> 31432.94s]  Alright, every time.
[31432.94s -> 31436.78s]  That stays on it.
[31436.78s -> 31440.24s]  I don't know.
[31440.24s -> 31442.24s]  So he just, he doesn't jump or anything.
[31442.24s -> 31444.24s]  He just stays on the line.
[31444.24s -> 31446.24s]  It just rips him to the...
[31446.24s -> 31450.59s]  I just didn't have any speed.
[31450.59s -> 31456.86s]  I was gonna fall off anyways.
[31456.86s -> 31462.50s]  Alright, 10 more attempts
[31462.50s -> 31465.57s]  and I'm gonna do this tomorrow.
[31465.57s -> 31467.57s]  I'm out of gas, man.
[31467.57s -> 31472.82s]  I just am.
[31472.82s -> 31474.82s]  I was probably out of gas like 40 minutes ago.
[31474.82s -> 31477.25s]  But I should be able to do this tomorrow.
[31477.25s -> 31479.25s]  After eating a good breakfast.
[31479.25s -> 31484.62s]  Cheats? No.
[31484.62s -> 31486.62s]  I cheat?
[31486.62s -> 31492.45s]  Why would I cheat?
[31492.45s -> 31505.25s]  You can still make it.
[31505.25s -> 31509.02s]  What about Helm's Deep?
[31509.02s -> 31511.02s]  That's a different kind of game though.
[31511.02s -> 31513.50s]  This requires
[31513.50s -> 31515.50s]  a huge amount of
[31515.50s -> 31517.50s]  concentration.
[31517.50s -> 31519.50s]  Helm's Deep was just running in circles kicking ladders.
[31519.50s -> 31522.00s]  So it's a little
[31522.00s -> 31526.03s]  different.
[31526.03s -> 31533.33s]  Just get the funny bad ending.
[31533.33s -> 31535.57s]  Funny bad ending?
[31535.57s -> 31541.58s]  Just do the
[31541.58s -> 31543.58s]  infinite grind cheat.
[31543.58s -> 31549.52s]  6
[31549.52s -> 31552.27s]  5
[31552.27s -> 31558.35s]  How far am I gonna go?
[31558.35s -> 31576.21s]  5, son.
[31576.21s -> 31578.21s]  I don't reliably get it
[31578.21s -> 31580.21s]  to be able to get up there.
[31580.21s -> 31582.21s]  It's something to do with how I'm jumping or how...
[31582.21s -> 31593.28s]  I don't understand.
[31593.28s -> 31595.28s]  Don't let the pervert skateboarder win.
[31595.28s -> 31597.52s]  Did I miss that?
[31597.52s -> 31599.82s]  Why am I reading chat right now?
[31599.82s -> 31603.34s]  I think I've clocked out.
[31603.34s -> 31605.34s]  I'm just looking over there.
[31605.34s -> 31610.72s]  What are people saying?
[31610.72s -> 31612.72s]  I'm teleporting up to the top of the building
[31612.72s -> 31614.72s]  instead of the pipe that I'm trying to grind on.
[31614.72s -> 31622.59s]  There's another ramp to the right?
[31622.59s -> 31624.59s]  I'm supposed to be doing his
[31624.59s -> 31626.59s]  line, right?
[31626.59s -> 31632.22s]  Aren't I supposed to follow him to grab these things?
[31632.22s -> 31637.92s]  Get a grind
[31637.92s -> 31639.92s]  to gutter. That's what I'm trying to do.
[31639.92s -> 31641.92s]  That keeps on going up to the top of the roof.
[31641.92s -> 31645.70s]  See what he does here?
[31645.70s -> 31647.87s]  I did it, but...
[31647.87s -> 31649.87s]  Alright, you know, I'm not gonna restart.
[31649.87s -> 31651.87s]  Let me just look at this.
[31651.87s -> 31653.87s]  I feel like I've done the same...
[31653.87s -> 31659.89s]  He rips to the right.
[31659.89s -> 31661.89s]  When he gets up there, he goes like this.
[31661.89s -> 31666.69s]  And he goes like...
[31666.69s -> 31668.93s]  Like...
[31668.93s -> 31685.25s]  What's that?
[31685.25s -> 31687.25s]  You gotta get on it?
[31687.25s -> 31704.40s]  Let me just practice.
[31704.40s -> 31706.40s]  If I just spam Y,
[31706.40s -> 31712.48s]  it takes me over here.
[31712.48s -> 31714.48s]  If I just go like...
[31714.48s -> 31720.82s]  It just snaps to the wire.
[31720.82s -> 31730.03s]  My balance is shit though.
[31730.03s -> 31733.36s]  I need to get my rail up.
[31733.36s -> 31735.36s]  Is there like a free skate
[31735.36s -> 31738.30s]  where I can just get...
[31738.30s -> 31745.41s]  My balance is really not great.
[31745.41s -> 31751.49s]  Let me try this like one or two more times.
[31751.49s -> 31756.80s]  I'm gonna use it.
[31756.80s -> 31758.80s]  I turned it off.
[31758.80s -> 31764.24s]  Ultra concentration.
[31764.24s -> 31766.24s]  Alright, same theory.
[31766.24s -> 31769.12s]  So just...
[31769.12s -> 31772.64s]  Here it is.
[31772.64s -> 31778.77s]  I'm still up here.
[31778.77s -> 31784.02s]  Now what?
[31784.02s -> 31793.66s]  He goes down.
[31793.66s -> 31795.66s]  Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
[31795.66s -> 31810.06s]  Where's he? Back?
[31810.06s -> 31835.22s]  It's alright! It's alright!
[31835.22s -> 31837.22s]  It's alright! It's alright!
[31837.22s -> 31856.14s]  I didn't know it was gonna rip that way.
[31856.14s -> 31861.97s]  What are you talking about? What?
[31861.97s -> 31867.28s]  How does he do that?
[31867.28s -> 31869.28s]  I think I can do... How does he get up there?
[31869.28s -> 31871.28s]  Hold on, can I stay here?
[31871.28s -> 31876.21s]  Holy shit, man.
[31876.21s -> 31878.70s]  You gotta be serious.
[31878.70s -> 31889.84s]  Alright, let's try this again.
[31889.84s -> 31894.06s]  I was kinda close.
[31894.06s -> 31901.68s]  I think that's better than I've ever done.
[31901.68s -> 31912.56s]  That might've been the only one to find out.
[31912.56s -> 31915.31s]  Get this down.
[31915.31s -> 31917.81s]  I jumped over it.
[31917.81s -> 31919.81s]  I'm delayed by like 4 tenths of a second right now.
[31919.81s -> 31932.35s]  Every time that hits me.
[31932.35s -> 31936.19s]  Let your older brother do it.
[31936.19s -> 31938.56s]  Imagine this older brother scenario here.
[31938.56s -> 31940.56s]  Imagine this older brother scenario here.
[31940.56s -> 31943.70s]  This would suck total asshole.
[31943.70s -> 31945.70s]  Being the older brother in this scenario.
[31945.70s -> 31947.70s]  This isn't just like jump over Bowser.
[31947.70s -> 31949.70s]  Little older brother.
[31949.70s -> 31951.70s]  Can you just jump over Bowser and grab the axe?
[31951.70s -> 31953.70s]  Yeah, of course I can, little brother!
[31953.70s -> 31955.70s]  Look at me! I can do it!
[31955.70s -> 31957.70s]  I'm so good at video games.
[31957.70s -> 31959.70s]  Can you beat this for me, older brother?
[31959.70s -> 31961.87s]  Yeah!
[31961.87s -> 31963.87s]  Need me to get another axe?
[31963.87s -> 31965.87s]  From, uh, dear old Bowser there?
[31965.87s -> 31967.87s]  Nope, this!
[31967.87s -> 31972.02s]  Oh!
[31972.02s -> 31978.42s]  Let me see it!
[31978.42s -> 31981.68s]  This is the ultimate older brother scenario.
[31981.68s -> 31984.37s]  I would try it.
[31984.37s -> 31991.90s]  Here we are.
[31991.90s -> 32003.17s]  That's another wired knife.
[32003.17s -> 32005.41s]  I'm calling it at 9 hours.
[32005.41s -> 32008.80s]  I'm calling it at 9 hours.
[32008.80s -> 32010.80s]  Actually have to call it.
[32010.80s -> 32015.22s]  I have to call it at 9 hours.
[32015.22s -> 32017.22s]  I'll stream it tomorrow too.
[32017.22s -> 32019.22s]  Day 5 in a row coming up here.
[32019.22s -> 32021.22s]  And I don't want...
[32021.22s -> 32023.22s]  I don't want to stream like 60 hours this week.
[32023.22s -> 32025.22s]  I don't want to stream like 60 hours this week.
[32025.22s -> 32027.22s]  We're like crossing like
[32027.22s -> 32029.22s]  50 something hours
[32029.22s -> 32038.82s]  as of tomorrow.
[32038.82s -> 32040.82s]  I really didn't plan on having like
[32040.82s -> 32042.82s]  4, 50 plus hour like
[32042.82s -> 32048.06s]  I had it but I lost it.
[32048.06s -> 32064.83s]  People are working more than
[32064.83s -> 32068.67s]  60 hours a week?
[32068.67s -> 32072.13s]  That's a lot of time.
[32072.13s -> 32074.13s]  That's 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.
[32074.13s -> 32076.13s]  Holy shit.
[32076.13s -> 32081.44s]  70 hours a week?
[32081.44s -> 32088.03s]  70?
[32088.03s -> 32099.30s]  I was always at like 38.
[32099.30s -> 32101.86s]  Like 35 to like
[32101.86s -> 32103.86s]  40.
[32103.86s -> 32105.86s]  7 fucking hours, holy shit.
[32105.86s -> 32107.86s]  That's a lot of time.
[32107.86s -> 32122.45s]  I overshot it.
[32122.45s -> 32127.57s]  Alright, 8, 56.
[32127.57s -> 32131.60s]  That's 8 days a week.
[32131.60s -> 32133.60s]  It depends on how many hours you work.
[32133.60s -> 32135.60s]  You work like 20 straight hours.
[32135.60s -> 32137.60s]  Like 12 straight hours.
[32137.60s -> 32140.74s]  That's a lot of time.
[32140.74s -> 32144.64s]  Yeah, I got that
[32144.64s -> 32146.64s]  9 hour a week schedule.
[32146.64s -> 32159.38s]  I can't even see the wires.
[32159.38s -> 32166.74s]  I don't even know which one I'm jumping to.
[32166.74s -> 32177.42s]  Just hold Y?
[32177.42s -> 32189.46s]  Yeah, I was.
[32189.46s -> 32191.46s]  I'm really just trying to follow him.
[32191.46s -> 32193.46s]  That's distracting in its own way.
[32193.46s -> 32213.42s]  How am I not going
[32213.42s -> 32216.18s]  far enough?
[32216.18s -> 32237.68s]  I'm waiting for the...
[32237.68s -> 32239.68s]  I don't think it's a complete disaster yet.
[32239.68s -> 32252.80s]  Fucking rail sucks.
[32252.80s -> 32258.82s]  I have 2 minutes to do this.
[32258.82s -> 32299.46s]  How was I not turned all the way?
[32299.46s -> 32301.46s]  What the fuck, man?
[32301.46s -> 32311.82s]  Having like 60%
[32311.82s -> 32313.82s]  rail is actually fucking ruining this whole thing.
[32313.82s -> 32316.19s]  Not having the rail
[32316.19s -> 32318.19s]  at 100% is actually
[32318.19s -> 32320.19s]  ruining these runs.
[32320.19s -> 32323.07s]  Without a doubt. I don't even know where he is.
[32323.07s -> 32332.61s]  I need to level up like 5
[32332.61s -> 32334.98s]  more times.
[32334.98s -> 32336.98s]  To be able to reliably probably do this.
[32336.98s -> 32342.67s]  I'm up in front of you.
[32342.67s -> 32344.67s]  Dude, why am I even...
[32344.67s -> 32354.14s]  This is where I got to last time.
[32354.14s -> 32356.14s]  He goes up and then he rides the...
[32356.14s -> 32365.49s]  No!
[32365.49s -> 32367.49s]  That's the farthest I've gone.
[32367.49s -> 32370.11s]  It was right there. I was so close.
[32370.11s -> 32372.11s]  I just didn't know what was next.
[32372.11s -> 32374.74s]  Do it in one combo. Do it in one combo!
[32374.74s -> 32380.94s]  That's the first time I've ever even seen that one.
[32380.94s -> 32392.98s]  Should have just done the flush.
[32392.98s -> 32395.86s]  I feel like I can do it now.
[32395.86s -> 32398.29s]  Let's see. I'm supposed to stop
[32398.29s -> 32400.66s]  right now.
[32400.66s -> 32404.24s]  Why even give him fucking firebombs?
[32404.24s -> 32406.24s]  This shit already sucks.
[32406.24s -> 32408.24s]  Why?
[32408.24s -> 32424.35s]  Oh, boss.
[32424.35s -> 32427.30s]  That Eric Wynn.
[32427.30s -> 32429.30s]  Why can't I just push him off the fucking balcony?
[32431.30s -> 32444.78s]  Why?
[32444.78s -> 32446.78s]  Is it there? I tried to wait to
[32446.78s -> 32467.39s]  jump on the other side of the bridge.
[32467.39s -> 32469.70s]  I feel like
[32469.70s -> 32471.70s]  transferring there is
[32471.70s -> 32473.70s]  probably not a great idea.
[32482.24s -> 32491.12s]  Slow it down.
[32491.12s -> 32493.12s]  What are you up to?
[32493.12s -> 32495.12s]  What are you up to?
[32495.12s -> 32509.20s]  What are you two boys
[32509.20s -> 32511.20s]  up to?
[32511.20s -> 32513.20s]  That's Adam Sandler doing his grandmother.
[32513.20s -> 32536.48s]  Alright, I got plenty of time.
[32536.48s -> 32539.17s]  Oh, you motherfucker. Are you kidding me?
[32560.08s -> 32564.11s]  This sucks.
[32564.11s -> 32569.81s]  Why?
[32569.81s -> 32571.81s]  This sucks,
[32571.81s -> 32574.43s]  asshole.
[32574.43s -> 32578.85s]  This sucks.
[32578.85s -> 32584.86s]  Jump higher.
[32584.86s -> 32593.63s]  That's a good idea.
[32593.63s -> 32595.63s]  This is where it gets all fucked up.
[32595.63s -> 32598.51s]  Speaking of fucking up.
[32598.51s -> 32601.58s]  How are you going to sleep tonight
[32601.58s -> 32604.21s]  knowing Eric schooled you?
[32604.21s -> 32606.21s]  I'm not going to. I'm not done.
[32606.21s -> 32611.78s]  I'm at like 38
[32611.78s -> 32613.78s]  out of 41. I was going to throw in
[32613.78s -> 32617.55s]  the towel, but
[32617.55s -> 32619.55s]  I didn't think I was going to get past
[32619.55s -> 32623.01s]  16. So I can't throw
[32623.01s -> 32625.01s]  the towel in now because I saw the end of
[32625.01s -> 32628.02s]  the game. Quick, gas
[32628.02s -> 32630.45s]  light it. You don't need to gas
[32630.45s -> 32632.45s]  light me. I'm already
[32632.45s -> 32642.43s]  burning. This fire is hot.
[32642.43s -> 32659.14s]  Why can I not do this?
[32659.14s -> 32661.31s]  It's one of the things I can't fucking do.
[32661.31s -> 32663.31s]  It's that stupid thing.
[32663.31s -> 32665.74s]  It's like one of the only things
[32665.74s -> 32667.74s]  I can't do now. Oh my god.
[32667.74s -> 32675.66s]  Go back.
[32675.66s -> 32679.70s]  Go back. Alright, here we go.
[32679.70s -> 32681.70s]  Playground bullshit.
[32681.70s -> 32694.94s]  I was on the fucking power cord
[32694.94s -> 32701.09s]  for too long. Just get off. I have a new strategy.
[32701.09s -> 32704.93s]  I don't give a shit. Just grab him.
[32718.74s -> 32720.74s]  You stabbed me in the back.
[32720.74s -> 32722.74s]  Why did you stab me in the fucking
[32722.74s -> 32737.20s]  back? Dumb thing
[32737.20s -> 32741.49s]  to do. You keep getting to that
[32741.49s -> 32743.49s]  stupid part. And yes, I'm
[32743.49s -> 32745.49s]  just going to jump. I'm going to get off the fucking
[32745.49s -> 32747.49s]  thing. And I'm just going to grab him because
[32747.49s -> 32749.49s]  I can't. I can't
[32749.49s -> 32751.49s]  do it. I can do it while walking.
[32751.49s -> 32754.56s]  Or I'm just going to say fuck it
[32754.56s -> 32756.56s]  and just practice it.
[32756.56s -> 32759.18s]  I've gotten so far. Like what the
[32759.18s -> 32761.18s]  hell, Eric?
[32761.18s -> 32764.13s]  How did he drop you in the ocean?
[32764.13s -> 32769.95s]  Hey, just stop
[32769.95s -> 32771.95s]  sucking.
[32771.95s -> 32777.50s]  Yeah.
[32777.50s -> 32779.50s]  Maybe we should do that too.
[32779.50s -> 32785.58s]  What other phrases can I get out of you?
[32785.58s -> 32790.75s]  This streamer sucks.
[32790.75s -> 32796.18s]  Stop
[32796.18s -> 32807.12s]  pretending.
[32807.12s -> 32809.62s]  Stop stalling, idiot.
[32809.62s -> 32821.90s]  Twitch chat
[32821.90s -> 32824.34s]  comes with four phrases
[32824.34s -> 32826.34s]  and has a karate chop action.
[32843.36s -> 32850.08s]  Alright, I have
[32850.08s -> 32852.08s]  I don't do it now, I'm off.
[32852.08s -> 32854.08s]  I'm more of a molding
[32854.08s -> 32856.08s]  meltdown PlayStation
[32856.08s -> 32858.08s]  fucking 2 stream.
[32858.08s -> 32870.80s]  Who cares?
[32870.80s -> 32882.38s]  Alright, here we go. What is it? It's Xbox.
[32882.38s -> 32884.88s]  How dare you
[32884.88s -> 32886.88s]  correct me? Did you just
[32886.88s -> 32890.02s]  correct the streamer?
[32890.02s -> 32892.02s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32892.02s -> 32894.90s]  That's corrected?
[32894.90s -> 32898.86s]  Okay.
[32898.86s -> 32904.61s]  How did I miss that?
[32904.61s -> 32906.61s]  I held Y the whole time?
[32906.61s -> 32910.45s]  I held Y and I waited so long.
[32910.45s -> 32914.74s]  His ego.
[32914.74s -> 32916.74s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32916.74s -> 32918.74s]  You're saying it's on the Xbox
[32918.74s -> 32920.74s]  and make me look bad
[32920.74s -> 32922.74s]  in front of fucking like 400
[32922.74s -> 32924.98s]  people?
[32924.98s -> 32927.41s]  I can't.
[32927.41s -> 32929.41s]  I don't get it, I don't understand.
[32929.41s -> 32932.54s]  What the fuck did you...
[32932.54s -> 32942.59s]  I'm holding Y when I jump
[32942.59s -> 32946.82s]  too. It seems so
[32946.82s -> 32949.82s]  finicky.
[32949.82s -> 32951.82s]  Tap Y?
[32951.82s -> 32953.82s]  I mean, that's what I
[32953.82s -> 32955.82s]  was tapping Y before and I got a bunch of
[32955.82s -> 32957.82s]  people telling me that I should hold Y.
[32957.82s -> 32980.08s]  Which one is it? I was falling off.
[32980.08s -> 32982.51s]  I'm like, that's almost like
[32982.51s -> 32984.51s]  I'm not getting enough air.
[32984.51s -> 32987.58s]  What is my air even at?
[32987.58s -> 32989.58s]  Doesn't it feel like I'm not getting enough air?
[32989.58s -> 32992.14s]  Apparently, I don't know.
[32992.14s -> 33002.83s]  Breathe.
[33002.83s -> 33027.92s]  I thought I was too late
[33027.92s -> 33030.99s]  before, now I'm too early.
[33030.99s -> 33032.99s]  That's the worst jump of the whole entire run.
[33032.99s -> 33034.99s]  The other ones I could probably get if I did them enough times.
[33034.99s -> 33043.82s]  It was definitely too early, yeah.
[33043.82s -> 33045.82s]  I figured maybe because the bridge goes
[33045.82s -> 33047.82s]  up before it goes down.
[33047.82s -> 33049.82s]  Maybe. Let's see.
[33049.82s -> 33054.94s]  Plus, I have to fucking worry
[33054.94s -> 33056.94s]  about the stupid triangle on the screen.
[33059.50s -> 33077.23s]  Like that. Meltdown?
[33077.23s -> 33079.23s]  No, I don't think so.
[33079.23s -> 33084.74s]  I don't think so.
[33084.74s -> 33089.47s]  I'm alright right now.
[33089.47s -> 33105.92s]  Fucking... I'm fine. Hey, you know
[33105.92s -> 33107.92s]  what does it say? You don't have to come over for career day
[33107.92s -> 33110.10s]  anymore? Wait, what, why?
[33110.10s -> 33113.36s]  Go to bed? I'm fine.
[33113.36s -> 33117.46s]  Don't worry.
[33117.46s -> 33119.46s]  This is the end, too. And I'm not playing
[33119.46s -> 33121.46s]  Xbox tomorrow.
[33121.46s -> 33123.95s]  We're doing Diablo 2 tomorrow.
[33123.95s -> 33126.64s]  So, it's a whole other
[33126.64s -> 33128.64s]  setup. So, it's either now or
[33128.64s -> 33143.17s]  it's probably never. I didn't even
[33143.17s -> 33145.17s]  mean to jump. I let go. My hands
[33145.17s -> 33147.17s]  are sweaty. I had my hand
[33147.17s -> 33163.23s]  let go of me. I didn't mean to jump.
[33163.23s -> 33165.23s]  Let's go. Let's go. This is it.
[33165.23s -> 33176.50s]  All night, boys and girls.
[33176.50s -> 33188.45s]  You're not. Something is
[33188.45s -> 33190.45s]  wrong. What am I doing wrong?
[33190.45s -> 33192.45s]  Is it still too early?
[33192.45s -> 33195.33s]  I can't even fucking tell,
[33195.33s -> 33198.85s]  man. How far
[33198.85s -> 33200.85s]  do I have to be on this stupid
[33200.85s -> 33210.06s]  thing? You're supposed to have max
[33210.06s -> 33216.53s]  stats. Am I really
[33216.53s -> 33218.53s]  just doing this for no reason because I don't have enough stats
[33218.53s -> 33223.33s]  to do it? I mean, I've gotten pretty
[33223.33s -> 33225.76s]  damn close. Yes.
[33225.76s -> 33229.28s]  No. Why
[33229.28s -> 33231.28s]  do I feel like people saying no want
[33231.28s -> 33233.28s]  this to be a 12 hour stream?
[33233.28s -> 33254.51s]  I've waited so long.
[33254.51s -> 33256.51s]  If I wait any longer, I'm going to fall
[33256.51s -> 33272.83s]  off the damn bridge. Losing too much
[33272.83s -> 33275.26s]  momentum. You need to jump
[33275.26s -> 33277.82s]  more.
[33277.82s -> 33279.82s]  That's what I was thinking. Just like jump.
[33279.82s -> 33281.82s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[33281.82s -> 33284.96s]  He's going sideways.
[33284.96s -> 33292.90s]  The absolute worst
[33292.90s -> 33303.46s]  time. Plus, the guy going sideways.
[33303.46s -> 33305.46s]  That's what you guys have been
[33305.46s -> 33307.46s]  talking about. I was wondering what the fuck
[33307.46s -> 33309.46s]  you guys are talking about. Admin, he's
[33309.46s -> 33312.53s]  going sideways. That's
[33312.53s -> 33314.53s]  what you guys are on about. Okay.
[33314.53s -> 33330.00s]  I think I'm going crazy. How is
[33330.00s -> 33341.97s]  it possible? I feel like you're missing
[33341.97s -> 33347.92s]  Tony Hawk.
[33347.92s -> 33350.99s]  God damn it.
[33350.99s -> 33352.99s]  Why do you have to keep me
[33352.99s -> 33354.99s]  addicted here on this
[33354.99s -> 33356.99s]  fucking burn
[33356.99s -> 33358.99s]  into muscle memory?
[33358.99s -> 33360.99s]  This one stage.
[33360.99s -> 33369.70s]  I haven't even done a royal flush in a while
[33369.70s -> 33371.70s]  either. What a fucking mistake.
[33401.17s -> 33405.90s]  Now we're getting, alright. Now
[33405.90s -> 33409.30s]  we're getting, we're getting to this, yeah.
[33409.30s -> 33411.30s]  You know the stage of
[33411.30s -> 33413.30s]  video game madness?
[33413.30s -> 33415.30s]  When you do
[33415.30s -> 33417.30s]  the same thing so many times
[33417.30s -> 33419.30s]  that
[33419.30s -> 33421.30s]  it starts to become a dream.
[33421.30s -> 33423.30s]  I'm having a dream about this game
[33423.30s -> 33425.30s]  right now, this stage, right here.
[33425.30s -> 33434.38s]  Your skills are depleting.
[33434.38s -> 33441.60s]  Yes.
[33441.60s -> 33443.60s]  Alright, I'm calling it. I'm calling it.
[33443.60s -> 33445.60s]  That's it. I'm calling it. I've called it. Now I
[33445.60s -> 33447.60s]  have to do it. I have to call it. I've called it.
[33447.60s -> 33449.60s]  It's over. I've called it.
[33449.60s -> 33451.60s]  It's over. That's it. That's enough.
[33451.60s -> 33453.78s]  We'll be live tomorrow with Diablo 2.
[33453.78s -> 33456.40s]  I've called it.
[33456.40s -> 33458.40s]  I've called it.
[33458.40s -> 33460.40s]  I can't sit here and do this anymore.
[33460.40s -> 33462.40s]  This burning hole in my brain.
[33462.40s -> 33466.48s]  I can't.
[33466.48s -> 33468.48s]  I'm gonna go to the, oh here comes another
[33468.48s -> 33470.48s]  doctor bit. Oh, Derby, you go to the doctor
[33470.48s -> 33472.48s]  when something happens in a video game and you get
[33472.48s -> 33474.48s]  like mad? Yeah, you come to me every time.
[33474.48s -> 33476.48s]  I know. Let me go, let me see if I can figure
[33476.48s -> 33478.48s]  out what you're gonna say. Hmm.
[33478.48s -> 33480.48s]  You're going to say, uh,
[33480.48s -> 33482.48s]  hey doc, something's wrong. And the doctor's
[33482.48s -> 33484.48s]  gonna say, oh, did you play Tony Hawk 2?
[33484.48s -> 33487.94s]  Yes.
[33487.94s -> 33489.94s]  That was what I was about to do.
[33489.94s -> 33496.70s]  The time loop.
[33496.70s -> 33499.52s]  I don't want to do this anymore.
[33499.52s -> 33501.52s]  If I don't actually get into the next
[33501.52s -> 33503.52s]  like three attempts,
[33503.52s -> 33506.53s]  I'm out. Maybe I'll try it again tomorrow.
[33506.53s -> 33526.61s]  Clip that. Somebody clip it.
[33526.61s -> 33528.61s]  And slow it down. For the frame.
[33528.61s -> 33539.79s]  It's my stats.
[33539.79s -> 33541.79s]  I want a frame by
[33541.79s -> 33543.79s]  frame analysis. I want to hire
[33543.79s -> 33545.79s]  like an e-sports pro to do a frame
[33545.79s -> 33547.79s]  by frame analysis is why I didn't jump
[33547.79s -> 33549.79s]  higher at the end of that.
[33549.79s -> 33552.35s]  Don't grind on the ledge. What do you want me to
[33552.35s -> 33554.35s]  jump? You don't want to, wait,
[33554.35s -> 33564.53s]  walk it? I was lucky.
[33564.53s -> 33566.53s]  I didn't even mean to get that. Do you see
[33566.53s -> 33568.53s]  how fucking horrible that was? I did
[33568.53s -> 33570.53s]  not even get that. I don't have enough
[33570.53s -> 33577.12s]  stats. Somebody, I want an e-sports
[33577.12s -> 33579.12s]  pro to clip that one and
[33579.12s -> 33581.12s]  tell me what happened with that.
[33581.12s -> 33612.53s]  Sorry, I fell into it.
[33612.53s -> 33617.26s]  I fell into it. Sorry, did you get speed?
[33617.26s -> 33628.98s]  Why did I go into a manual?
[33628.98s -> 33630.98s]  The Xbox controller with the one
[33630.98s -> 33632.98s]  big fucking button. One big
[33632.98s -> 33651.28s]  ass button.
[33651.28s -> 33656.78s]  Get it! Get up, it's okay. Your
[33656.78s -> 33658.78s]  knee's gonna be fine, honey. Your
[33658.78s -> 33660.78s]  knee's gonna be fine, honey!
[33660.78s -> 33667.06s]  Slam city jammer.
[33667.06s -> 33669.06s]  You lucky little bitch. Get back here.
[33669.06s -> 33672.38s]  You ain't nothing to me.
[33672.38s -> 33674.38s]  I can't. I can't
[33674.38s -> 33676.38s]  anymore. I can't. That was fucking
[33676.38s -> 33678.38s]  terrible. That was
[33678.38s -> 33681.44s]  that was terrible.
[33681.44s -> 33683.62s]  That was unbelievably awful.
[33702.42s -> 33704.42s]  That was so bad. I don't even feel
[33704.42s -> 33712.29s]  fulfilled. Praise
[33712.29s -> 33717.98s]  water. Dude,
[33717.98s -> 33719.98s]  I almost turned the camera on.
[33719.98s -> 33722.80s]  I almost turned the camera
[33722.80s -> 33724.80s]  on and did a wink right at the end.
[33724.80s -> 33726.98s]  Because I was like, fuck it, it's over and I'm just gonna get
[33726.98s -> 33731.97s]  a wink out. Oh my god,
[33731.97s -> 33733.97s]  that was so painful. I wasn't even that big
[33733.97s -> 33735.97s]  of a deal either. I'm so sorry, everybody.
[33738.53s -> 33740.53s]  That was probably so painful.
[33745.86s -> 33748.93s]  But yeah, look at that!
[33759.79s -> 33766.13s]  That game was great. What a fun game.
[33770.13s -> 33772.13s]  Oh, that was a really fun game.
[33772.13s -> 33774.13s]  Just as good as I remember.
[33779.38s -> 33781.38s]  We got a ton of subs, too.
[33781.38s -> 33783.38s]  Boiki gave 20 community subs.
[33791.20s -> 33793.50s]  Okay, so somebody gave...
[33795.50s -> 33797.50s]  Secret level.
[33797.50s -> 33801.73s]  We got Iron Man?
[33801.73s -> 33804.61s]  Marvel Iron Man
[33804.61s -> 33806.61s]  Iron Man and Marvel characters
[33806.61s -> 33809.62s]  are... I'm not going to bed.
[33809.62s -> 33812.16s]  Not yet. I'm not going to bed
[33812.16s -> 33814.16s]  yet. I want to see Iron Man. I want to do a secret level
[33814.16s -> 33816.98s]  with Iron Man. And Gene
[33816.98s -> 33829.84s]  Simmons. God damn you,
[33829.84s -> 33831.84s]  Tony Hawk.
[33831.84s -> 33833.84s]  I want to address these bits here.
[33833.84s -> 33835.84s]  SoupGG gave a thousand bits,
[33835.84s -> 33837.84s]  but first of all, they said cheesesteak guy here. Okay,
[33837.84s -> 33839.84s]  so cheesesteak guy, the guy that said he would beat
[33839.84s -> 33841.84s]  Big Apple's challenge before 10.
[33841.84s -> 33843.84s]  So I'll throw up my cheesesteak on my keyboard. I didn't,
[33843.84s -> 33845.84s]  by the way.
[33845.84s -> 33847.84s]  I just want to say you're the worst Tony Hawk player
[33847.84s -> 33849.84s]  I've ever seen.
[33849.84s -> 33851.84s]  It's not even true. You give this controller to a baby
[33851.84s -> 33853.84s]  and they won't be able to get past level one, I guarantee you.
[33853.84s -> 33855.84s]  That being said, this is probably my favorite stream you've ever done.
[33855.84s -> 33857.84s]  Thank you, Jeremy. Love you. Thanks for playing my favorite game
[33857.84s -> 33859.84s]  ever.
[33859.84s -> 33866.10s]  Let's try that again.
[33866.10s -> 33868.10s]  SoupGG says...
[33868.10s -> 33870.10s]  SoupGG says, hey, cheesesteak
[33870.10s -> 33872.10s]  guy here.
[33872.10s -> 33874.10s]  If you don't know,
[33874.10s -> 33876.10s]  somebody told me
[33876.10s -> 33878.10s]  SoupGG said that
[33878.10s -> 33880.10s]  I can't even do it again.
[33880.10s -> 33882.91s]  SoupGG said that if
[33882.91s -> 33884.91s]  I beat Tony Hawk Pro Skater
[33884.91s -> 33886.91s]  Underground,
[33886.91s -> 33888.91s]  Big Apple spot challenge in
[33888.91s -> 33890.91s]  four attempts, he would throw up a cheesesteak on his keyboard.
[33890.91s -> 33892.91s]  I didn't, by the way,
[33892.91s -> 33894.91s]  if you're just joining us. That didn't happen.
[33894.91s -> 33896.91s]  That being said,
[33896.91s -> 33898.91s]  you're probably the worst Tony Hawk player
[33898.91s -> 33900.91s]  I've ever seen. I said that's not true.
[33900.91s -> 33902.91s]  This is probably my favorite stream you've ever done.
[33902.91s -> 33904.91s]  Thank you for playing my favorite game ever.
[33904.91s -> 33909.14s]  I'm not the worst Tony Hawk player
[33909.14s -> 33911.14s]  you've ever seen. If I was the worst Tony Hawk player
[33911.14s -> 33913.14s]  you've ever seen, I wouldn't have beaten
[33913.14s -> 33915.14s]  the game. I would have...
[33915.14s -> 33917.50s]  Guys, worst Tony Hawk player ever
[33917.50s -> 33919.50s]  means you can't even do a manual.
[33919.50s -> 33922.06s]  You don't even know what it is.
[33922.06s -> 33924.06s]  Like, you don't even know what a combo is. You just do a kickflip
[33924.06s -> 33926.06s]  over a ledge.
[33926.06s -> 33928.69s]  You don't even know...
[33928.69s -> 33930.69s]  I think that you cannot be claimed as one of the
[33930.69s -> 33932.69s]  worst Tony Hawk players ever,
[33932.69s -> 33934.69s]  if you get a hundred thousand points
[33934.69s -> 33936.69s]  on a combo. You just not.
[33936.69s -> 33938.69s]  That's impossible.
[33938.69s -> 33940.69s]  People just do a kickflip and get a hundred points
[33940.69s -> 33947.86s]  and they're done. You're the worst
[33947.86s -> 33949.86s]  player to have beaten the game.
[33949.86s -> 33951.86s]  That's like so not even true.
[33951.86s -> 33956.34s]  Even worst Tony Hawk player would beat
[33956.34s -> 33958.34s]  Eric first try. That's not even true.
[33958.34s -> 33960.90s]  That's not even true. That guy's gonna whip.
[33960.90s -> 33964.42s]  Alright. That's dangerous, mate.
[33964.42s -> 33966.42s]  That's not how you use a whip.
[33966.42s -> 33969.30s]  You crack a whip. You don't
[33969.30s -> 33971.60s]  swing a whip.
[33971.60s -> 33976.02s]  It's just in the Neversoft office.
[33976.02s -> 33978.02s]  These guys are doing this wrong. Someone's gonna get hurt.
[33978.02s -> 33989.86s]  Funny story.
[33989.86s -> 33991.86s]  For the Carnival stream,
[33991.86s -> 33994.74s]  instead of Polypolite and
[33994.74s -> 33996.74s]  Cuddles,
[33996.74s -> 33999.30s]  we were in talks
[33999.30s -> 34001.30s]  to have a different
[34001.30s -> 34003.30s]  clown on that stream.
[34003.30s -> 34005.30s]  And that clown was a
[34005.30s -> 34007.30s]  kind of one of those...
[34007.30s -> 34009.30s]  He said it was kind of like a freak show clown.
[34009.30s -> 34011.30s]  He was going to bring
[34011.30s -> 34013.30s]  a whip and I
[34013.30s -> 34015.30s]  was gonna put a cigarette in my mouth and he was going to
[34015.30s -> 34017.30s]  whip a cigarette out of my mouth.
[34017.30s -> 34019.30s]  And we were seconds
[34019.30s -> 34021.30s]  away from signing this guy.
[34021.30s -> 34023.30s]  But the reason why we didn't is in the 0.01%
[34023.30s -> 34025.30s]  chance that he like
[34025.30s -> 34027.30s]  blows up my face.
[34027.30s -> 34030.11s]  So we were like, no,
[34030.11s -> 34032.11s]  we can't. That's not a good
[34032.11s -> 34045.10s]  idea. That's a
[34045.10s -> 34047.54s]  family guy joke. I mean,
[34047.54s -> 34049.54s]  it's a sideshow act.
[34049.54s -> 34052.03s]  So he was gonna like,
[34052.03s -> 34054.03s]  hey, I'm gonna whip the thing out of your mouth.
[34054.03s -> 34056.03s]  Because he's very accurate and
[34056.03s -> 34061.41s]  that would have been legendary.
[34061.41s -> 34063.41s]  But I can't. No. We talked about it
[34063.41s -> 34065.41s]  extensively. The guy was a really nice guy too.
[34065.41s -> 34067.41s]  He's really like
[34067.41s -> 34069.41s]  interesting, really fun, smart person.
[34069.41s -> 34080.42s]  Imagine if your childhood
[34080.42s -> 34082.42s]  friends stole your jokes and got more Twitch
[34082.42s -> 34084.42s]  subscribers than you. Would you
[34084.42s -> 34086.42s]  let him win or would you beat him in a clown off?
[34086.42s -> 34091.22s]  That was a bit message.
[34091.22s -> 34094.29s]  I had to read it. Alright, that's somebody's
[34094.29s -> 34105.36s]  fucking tooth. Where's Iron Man?
[34120.35s -> 34122.35s]  Oh my god.
[34122.35s -> 34124.35s]  Are you serious?
[34124.35s -> 34126.35s]  Edit tricks.
[34126.35s -> 34128.35s]  Special tricks.
[34128.35s -> 34130.35s]  The scanner. The boot
[34130.35s -> 34132.35s]  burst and fire blaster.
[34132.35s -> 34137.79s]  Let's go to
[34137.79s -> 34139.79s]  didn't we get a new level?
[34139.79s -> 34141.79s]  We got Venice, right?
[34141.79s -> 34145.31s]  Alright, here we go.
[34145.31s -> 34147.31s]  Iron Man.
[34147.31s -> 34150.77s]  Make Iron Man
[34150.77s -> 34160.18s]  flush. Oh, that was sand.
[34176.46s -> 34182.34s]  Here we go.
[34207.79s -> 34223.41s]  His head rocked back.
[34228.45s -> 34230.45s]  Okay, I need to, I have to leave.
[34230.45s -> 34232.45s]  I have to leave. I actually have to leave.
[34232.45s -> 34235.58s]  This is too much.
[34238.91s -> 34245.31s]  I just want to try.
[34245.31s -> 34247.87s]  Let's just go to Manhattan.
[34247.87s -> 34249.87s]  He's going insane. Hotter than hell?
[34249.87s -> 34253.01s]  Oh fuck, hold on.
[34253.01s -> 34255.01s]  I will watch the second ending, I promise.
[34262.16s -> 34264.16s]  The last time you're going to see it, we might as well get it out of
[34264.16s -> 34266.98s]  our system now.
[34266.98s -> 34268.98s]  Did it get knocked down? Who pushed me over?
[34268.98s -> 34274.29s]  Holy shit.
[34274.29s -> 34276.29s]  This lady means business.
[34298.48s -> 34302.26s]  That fucking Ryan
[34302.26s -> 34304.26s]  Mancliffe is going to haunt me for like the next six hours.
[34304.26s -> 34312.58s]  Hotter than hell.
[34312.58s -> 34319.28s]  Do his
[34319.28s -> 34322.10s]  special.
[34322.10s -> 34324.66s]  Big upper special.
[34324.66s -> 34326.66s]  Down right B, left right
[34326.66s -> 34328.66s]  Y.
[34328.66s -> 34332.88s]  We need to get special up.
[34332.88s -> 34337.10s]  Oh, this is the kiss level.
[34337.10s -> 34340.43s]  Why?
[34340.43s -> 34342.99s]  It seems interesting.
[34342.99s -> 34346.06s]  Turn the music on for this stage.
[34346.06s -> 34348.06s]  I mean, I kind of have to, right?
[34350.06s -> 34367.39s]  Let's go.
[34367.39s -> 34384.61s]  Let's do down right B.
[34384.61s -> 34403.41s]  Get the letters. Get the letters.
[34403.41s -> 34406.67s]  No, that's 59,000.
[34406.67s -> 34411.15s]  This is my favorite kiss song.
[34411.15s -> 34414.21s]  Give me that thing.
[34414.21s -> 34423.73s]  All right, that's it. Flush him.
[34423.73s -> 34426.16s]  Can I get a double flush to end it?
[34426.16s -> 34428.16s]  Get the letters. Get the letters.
[34428.16s -> 34430.16s]  Let me get the letters.
[34430.16s -> 34432.40s]  Okay.
[34432.40s -> 34435.86s]  I got it.
[34435.86s -> 34438.78s]  I got this S.
[34438.78s -> 34442.43s]  Get the letters.
[34442.43s -> 34444.43s]  Guys, I'm so demanding.
[34444.43s -> 34446.43s]  So commanding and demanding.
[34446.43s -> 34448.43s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[34448.43s -> 34455.22s]  I don't know where the other letters even are.
[34455.22s -> 34461.42s]  All right, if I don't get 100,000 points
[34461.42s -> 34463.42s]  right now, I'm gonna get a 10
[34463.42s -> 34465.42s]  fucking, I'm gonna give 10
[34465.42s -> 34476.30s]  I'm gonna give 10
[34476.30s -> 34479.18s]  french fries to Kim.
[34479.18s -> 34485.20s]  Go to McDonald's next.
[34485.20s -> 34489.04s]  All right, it's K. Did I get it?
[34489.04s -> 34491.47s]  K. I got it.
[34491.47s -> 34496.08s]  Okay. K. S.
[34496.08s -> 34508.61s]  Where's the other one?
[34508.61s -> 34513.28s]  I'm blind. I got that.
[34513.28s -> 34515.28s]  Oh, I thought that was just a glass panel.
[34515.28s -> 34517.84s]  Look at the other panels underneath it.
[34517.84s -> 34520.91s]  Okay. K.
[34520.91s -> 34522.91s]  I. S. Where's the last S?
[34522.91s -> 34533.98s]  In the ring.
[34533.98s -> 34541.73s]  I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[34541.73s -> 34543.73s]  I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[34543.73s -> 34551.92s]  I'm gonna pierce
[34551.92s -> 34564.08s]  my mind.
[34564.08s -> 34567.86s]  Why can't I get up here?
[34567.86s -> 34569.86s]  I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[34569.86s -> 34571.86s]  I'm gonna pierce my mind.
[34571.86s -> 34585.49s]  Transfer. I mean, it looks like I
[34585.49s -> 34591.50s]  I just know people are gonna be very
[34591.50s -> 34593.50s]  upset about that. All right, transfer.
[34593.50s -> 34596.13s]  It's in a weird spot.
[34596.13s -> 34599.97s]  Can I just grab it?
[34599.97s -> 34605.92s]  I'm the damn thing.
[34605.92s -> 34607.92s]  R to transfer. Let's do it.
[34607.92s -> 34613.74s]  Just vert transfer. Yeah, I'm just doing
[34613.74s -> 34615.74s]  vert. Just trying to do vert transfer.
[34615.74s -> 34618.94s]  Just like the
[34618.94s -> 34621.12s]  The half pipe is behind the
[34621.12s -> 34623.12s]  The half pipe is behind the
[34623.12s -> 34627.14s]  I'm not pressing R.
[34627.14s -> 34637.76s]  The half pipe is behind it.
[34637.76s -> 34639.76s]  Can I just spine over this?
[34639.76s -> 34641.76s]  No, just spine over that.
[34641.76s -> 34644.32s]  Why would I try to do this?
[34644.32s -> 34646.32s]  All right, now I have to just jump through those.
[34646.32s -> 34653.66s]  What?
[34653.66s -> 34655.66s]  Oh, I can do it this way.
[34655.66s -> 34669.55s]  Wait.
[34669.55s -> 34671.92s]  Guys, you have to give me
[34671.92s -> 34673.92s]  a little bit of a break here.
[34673.92s -> 34675.92s]  It's been 10 hours of Tony Hawk.
[34675.92s -> 34677.92s]  And I've peed two times.
[34677.92s -> 34679.92s]  So, yeah.
[34679.92s -> 34681.92s]  It's not going as clean as it could be.
[34681.92s -> 34683.92s]  It's not going as clean as it could be.
[34683.92s -> 34693.07s]  Congratulations, you unlocked the kiss movie.
[34693.07s -> 34737.66s]  Do it again.
[34737.66s -> 34739.66s]  They put on a show for you.
[34739.66s -> 34745.10s]  You're gonna get banned from Twitch.
[34745.10s -> 34747.73s]  It's in the video game.
[34747.73s -> 34749.73s]  I'm not gonna get banned from Twitch for everything that's in the video game.
[34749.73s -> 34777.06s]  Get out of the way.
[34777.06s -> 34779.06s]  I have to get up here. Wait, that's me.
[34779.06s -> 34786.03s]  That scared the shit out of me.
[34786.03s -> 34788.03s]  I didn't even mean to do that. I just hit L.
[34788.03s -> 34802.48s]  Oh, no.
[34802.48s -> 34804.48s]  Here comes a
[34804.48s -> 34806.48s]  crazed kiss fan.
[34806.48s -> 34808.48s]  He wants to get on stage with Gene Simmons.
[34808.48s -> 34812.96s]  He just wants a selfie.
[34812.96s -> 34828.06s]  Why am I the only one
[34828.06s -> 34830.06s]  falling down?
[34830.06s -> 34834.10s]  Look, it's us. We did it.
[34834.10s -> 34845.49s]  Okay, it's funny.
[34845.49s -> 34847.49s]  Okay, time to go to bed.
[34847.49s -> 34872.86s]  That's it.
[34872.86s -> 34874.86s]  Alternate ending. Okay, we'll do
[34874.86s -> 34876.86s]  alternate ending right now.
[34876.86s -> 34879.10s]  Oh, my God.
[34879.10s -> 34881.10s]  Alternate. That was Tony Hawk Underground.
[34881.10s -> 34883.10s]  And it's a fucking fantastic game.
[34883.10s -> 34885.10s]  I highly recommend it. If you have a 360
[34885.10s -> 34887.10s]  and there's a hard drive inside of it,
[34887.10s -> 34889.10s]  get Tony Hawk's Underground. Tony Hawk's Underground 2
[34889.10s -> 34891.79s]  is behind me.
[34891.79s -> 34897.66s]  It's right there.
[34897.66s -> 34901.76s]  You can play that at some point, too.
[34901.76s -> 34904.51s]  That was a fucking really fun time.
[34904.51s -> 34906.51s]  We stepped over the
[34906.51s -> 34908.51s]  we stepped over the meltdown
[34908.51s -> 34910.51s]  area. We just put our toe over it.
[34910.51s -> 34912.51s]  It'll last like an hour and a half.
[34912.51s -> 34921.46s]  We're good. Just enough to
[34921.46s -> 34923.70s]  have an issue.
[34923.70s -> 34927.73s]  It was a lot of fun.
[34927.73s -> 34929.73s]  Seriously, these games are fucking incredible.
[34929.73s -> 34931.73s]  I had an absolute blast.
[34931.73s -> 34933.73s]  I'm so happy I got to experience this
[34933.73s -> 34935.73s]  because I played all the main ones.
[34935.73s -> 34937.73s]  Tony Hawk, Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 3,
[34937.73s -> 34939.73s]  Tony Hawk 4. I never really
[34939.73s -> 34941.73s]  did this one.
[34941.73s -> 34943.73s]  I played it like here and there randomly, but
[34943.73s -> 34945.73s]  I never really played it.
[34945.73s -> 34948.29s]  But let's do the alternate ending.
[34948.29s -> 34950.29s]  This is what happens if what? What's the
[34950.29s -> 34955.54s]  scenario here?
[34955.54s -> 34957.54s]  How does this end? What's the scenario?
[34962.27s -> 34964.27s]  Why does this happen?
[34964.27s -> 34971.50s]  Somebody link it right here.
[34971.50s -> 34973.50s]  This is
[34973.50s -> 34975.50s]  Tony Hawk's Underground alternate
[34975.50s -> 34979.34s]  ending. Make sure I can
[34979.34s -> 34984.34s]  hear. Make sure you
[34984.34s -> 34986.34s]  guys can hear, too.
[34986.34s -> 34988.34s]  That's important. Alright, let's watch it.
[34988.34s -> 34996.59s]  Here we go. This is the
[34996.59s -> 34998.59s]  alternate ending to Tony Hawk Underground.
[35004.59s -> 35006.59s]  Aww.
[35006.59s -> 35008.59s]  How cute.
[35008.59s -> 35010.59s]  Two little skaters and their
[35010.59s -> 35012.59s]  ghetto shop.
[35012.59s -> 35014.59s]  Her Juvideo went over pretty good.
[35014.59s -> 35016.59s]  I guess kids dig that goofy soul skating crap.
[35016.59s -> 35018.83s]  I tell you what,
[35018.83s -> 35020.83s]  I'll buy you out for half a mil right now.
[35020.83s -> 35022.83s]  I got my checkbook.
[35022.83s -> 35025.01s]  I told you. It was never about the money.
[35025.01s -> 35027.01s]  Right, right, I forgot.
[35027.01s -> 35029.01s]  Mr. Pure,
[35029.01s -> 35031.01s]  I should have fixed you back in Tampa.
[35031.01s -> 35033.01s]  Tell it to your posse. We're through.
[35033.01s -> 35035.81s]  I've got everything I need.
[35035.81s -> 35038.05s]  Not this. Remember?
[35038.05s -> 35040.05s]  Hawaii building jump?
[35040.05s -> 35042.05s]  Helicopter? That was some sick
[35042.05s -> 35044.05s]  footage. Too bad no one ever
[35044.05s -> 35046.05s]  saw it. You backstabbing
[35046.05s -> 35048.05s]  mob flipping cockroach.
[35048.05s -> 35050.05s]  Hey, what do you say?
[35050.05s -> 35052.05s]  One last trip around the neighborhood.
[35052.05s -> 35054.05s]  Winner takes the
[35054.05s -> 35056.86s]  tape.
[35056.86s -> 35069.34s]  I wanted to do that.
[35069.34s -> 35073.18s]  That was...
[35073.18s -> 35075.18s]  Remember I was saying, like, why can't I just push
[35075.18s -> 35077.18s]  him over and get it? Why can't I throw him down
[35077.18s -> 35079.18s]  and get it? Wow.
[35079.18s -> 35094.85s]  How do you get this ending?
[35094.85s -> 35096.85s]  You got to get that scene. You have to earn it.
[35096.85s -> 35098.85s]  You beat the game a second time. Oh.
[35098.85s -> 35100.85s]  So when you get through a second time, they're just like, yeah.
[35100.85s -> 35102.85s]  You can just push him over. You don't have to do
[35102.85s -> 35104.85s]  the hard line
[35104.85s -> 35106.85s]  thing. That's funny.
[35106.85s -> 35110.05s]  Alright, that's where we're going to end it.
[35110.05s -> 35112.05s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for Diablo 2
[35112.05s -> 35115.50s]  Hardcore. It's been a while. It's been
[35115.50s -> 35118.70s]  a week, a couple of weeks actually,
[35118.70s -> 35120.70s]  hasn't it? It's been like week and a half.
[35120.70s -> 35126.59s]  See if we can beat Diablo.
[35126.59s -> 35132.66s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[35132.66s -> 35134.66s]  See you tomorrow. Starting at the same time
[35134.66s -> 35137.86s]  so probably around two o'clock.
[35137.86s -> 35140.48s]  Somewhere, yeah, two-ish. Two.
[35140.48s -> 35144.19s]  Same time. But let's do the bits.
[35144.19s -> 35146.19s]  Let's go back earlier.
[35146.19s -> 35148.19s]  I got to get this off my screen because
[35148.19s -> 35150.19s]  it's covering up everything. Thanks for joining me.
[35150.19s -> 35152.19s]  Thanks for joining us.
[35152.19s -> 35157.74s]  Hope you had a good time. I did.
[35157.74s -> 35159.74s]  We'll see you all tomorrow. Take care. Get some sleep.
[35159.74s -> 35162.75s]  See you soon.
[35162.75s -> 35167.22s]  But let's do the bits.
[35167.22s -> 35169.22s]  It's time for slime. Thanks for 500
[35169.22s -> 35171.46s]  bits. They say thug
[35171.46s -> 35174.72s]  hype. This was
[35174.72s -> 35176.72s]  one of those streams. A lot of people were waiting for it
[35176.72s -> 35181.14s]  and it was a good one.
[35181.14s -> 35183.14s]  Jay Onzel.
[35183.14s -> 35185.14s]  Thanks for the 300 bits. Hi, Jeremiah. I was so hyped
[35185.14s -> 35187.14s]  for the stream today because I loved this game and I'm just imagining
[35187.14s -> 35189.14s]  you as the Steve Buscemi skater meme.
[35189.14s -> 35192.98s]  We had a wink too?
[35192.98s -> 35197.57s]  That's a real wink.
[35197.57s -> 35204.16s]  Alright, let's go.
[35204.16s -> 35209.41s]  What was that image? Why was that like
[35209.41s -> 35221.63s]  back here? Look,
[35221.63s -> 35232.58s]  how long have I been in darkness?
[35232.58s -> 35241.65s]  This room's not dark.
[35241.65s -> 35243.65s]  You want me to blow up your immersion right now?
[35243.65s -> 35255.42s]  The room's not dark.
[35255.42s -> 35257.86s]  Holy shit, that's pretty bad here.
[35257.86s -> 35260.86s]  The exposure was down
[35260.86s -> 35262.86s]  low because I started the stream during the
[35262.86s -> 35266.00s]  day. Sorry, guys.
[35266.00s -> 35281.79s]  You look tired. Audio
[35281.79s -> 35283.79s]  is, yeah, audio's bad because of the
[35283.79s -> 35287.63s]  uh, I wonder why.
[35287.63s -> 35292.94s]  It's past my bedtime. No, I
[35292.94s -> 35296.34s]  guess I gotta eat something. I gotta
[35296.34s -> 35298.34s]  eat something. I ate
[35298.34s -> 35300.34s]  before the stream, but as a lot of you guys
[35300.34s -> 35302.34s]  know, I don't eat on stream.
[35302.34s -> 35304.34s]  Not usually.
[35304.34s -> 35306.34s]  I don't really like it. I did wink. Yes, I did
[35306.34s -> 35308.34s]  when it was dark. Fine, you wanna
[35308.34s -> 35318.13s]  loop Honda. Thanks for the 300
[35318.13s -> 35320.13s]  bits. They say uncanny. Uncanny.
[35320.13s -> 35322.30s]  Yes, it's online. 300
[35322.30s -> 35324.30s]  bits. Never thought in my life I would hear a
[35324.30s -> 35326.30s]  Quasimodo song on a Jerma stream.
[35326.30s -> 35331.04s]  Yeah, sorry to all
[35331.04s -> 35333.04s]  the VOD watchers. You probably
[35333.04s -> 35335.04s]  won't be able to watch any of this
[35335.04s -> 35337.47s]  stream. There's probably gonna be chunks
[35337.47s -> 35339.47s]  that are watchable, but
[35339.47s -> 35350.10s]  start the video now.
[35350.10s -> 35352.10s]  It hasn't taken on yet.
[35352.10s -> 35354.10s]  Quick. Load it into cache
[35354.10s -> 35356.10s]  on your browser. Quick. Do it.
[35356.10s -> 35358.72s]  Yeah, because I'm almost, this whole stream's
[35358.72s -> 35360.72s]  gonna be gone. But this was a, uh,
[35360.72s -> 35362.72s]  this was a fun live only
[35362.72s -> 35365.28s]  stream because there was just copyright
[35365.28s -> 35367.28s]  music playing almost the entire game.
[35367.28s -> 35370.54s]  Download it.
[35370.54s -> 35373.68s]  Yeah, thanks. AtroLux
[35373.68s -> 35375.68s]  Atrox, thanks for the thousand bits.
[35375.68s -> 35377.68s]  Ten dollars. Oh, there's nothing on the screen.
[35377.68s -> 35383.31s]  Thank you AtroLux.
[35383.31s -> 35385.31s]  Dropping this because this game is in my top five ever
[35385.31s -> 35388.06s]  thanks for playing it, man.
[35388.06s -> 35393.95s]  It is really, really, really good.
[35393.95s -> 35396.45s]  I wish they would make more of these.
[35396.45s -> 35398.75s]  Sorry.
[35398.75s -> 35402.21s]  Something in the throat there.
[35402.21s -> 35404.83s]  I wish they would make more of these and not
[35404.83s -> 35407.26s]  iPad games.
[35407.26s -> 35409.26s]  But I'm not sure if there's a market for it anymore.
[35409.26s -> 35411.26s]  Let's talk sad
[35411.26s -> 35413.50s]  truths here. I don't know
[35413.50s -> 35415.50s]  if there's really a huge market for
[35415.50s -> 35417.50s]  arcade skating games anymore.
[35417.50s -> 35420.38s]  Everybody wants skate 4.
[35420.38s -> 35422.38s]  Skate 4, people
[35422.38s -> 35424.38s]  requested every single year.
[35424.38s -> 35427.90s]  But I don't know if they would
[35427.90s -> 35429.90s]  What? What's going on?
[35429.90s -> 35431.90s]  Oh, God.
[35431.90s -> 35434.14s]  Sorry.
[35434.14s -> 35436.96s]  I just don't know. There might not be a
[35436.96s -> 35445.92s]  market for it anymore. It's just
[35445.92s -> 35447.92s]  it kind of fell out of popular
[35447.92s -> 35452.46s]  culture. There's a lot
[35452.46s -> 35454.46s]  of die hard fans of these games
[35454.46s -> 35456.46s]  for very good reason.
[35456.46s -> 35458.46s]  And I would say I would be one of them.
[35458.46s -> 35461.15s]  I never played skate, though.
[35461.15s -> 35463.46s]  I heard skate 3 was good. I never played it.
[35463.46s -> 35466.14s]  But I have played all the Tony Hawk's.
[35466.14s -> 35470.69s]  Pretty much. But people love it.
[35470.69s -> 35476.13s]  People love these things.
[35476.13s -> 35480.67s]  You did, didn't you?
[35480.67s -> 35482.67s]  I did not play skate 3.
[35482.67s -> 35485.42s]  Skate 3, no.
[35485.42s -> 35487.42s]  Tony Hawk 2.
[35487.42s -> 35489.42s]  You're probably thinking of Tony Hawk 2.
[35489.42s -> 35491.92s]  Yeah. That's definitely what you're thinking of.
[35491.92s -> 35498.64s]  Yeah.
[35498.64s -> 35500.64s]  Bulbaswag, thanks for the 999
[35500.64s -> 35502.64s]  bits. 999.
[35502.64s -> 35504.64s]  I've been on vacation, so I've missed the last few streams.
[35504.64s -> 35509.95s]  They look like a blast, though.
[35509.95s -> 35513.34s]  Yeah, I think Outer Wilds
[35513.34s -> 35515.34s]  was fun and
[35515.34s -> 35517.34s]  interesting. This stream was
[35517.34s -> 35519.58s]  kind of crazy and all
[35519.58s -> 35524.32s]  over the place. A lot of different
[35524.32s -> 35526.62s]  streams this week.
[35526.62s -> 35529.82s]  We're really going to chill out tomorrow.
[35529.82s -> 35534.43s]  He did play it.
[35534.43s -> 35536.43s]  I don't know. I don't click links in my chat.
[35536.43s -> 35539.38s]  Sorry.
[35539.38s -> 35541.38s]  We started. We watched like an
[35541.38s -> 35543.38s]  action movie with Siraswrath.
[35543.38s -> 35546.00s]  And then we did
[35546.00s -> 35548.00s]  explore and do the puzzle game
[35548.00s -> 35550.00s]  and figure out the
[35550.00s -> 35552.00s]  Outer Wilds.
[35552.00s -> 35554.00s]  And then we had a stream
[35554.00s -> 35556.00s]  today, which was
[35556.00s -> 35558.43s]  I laughed like every five seconds
[35558.43s -> 35560.67s]  of this stream. And then tomorrow
[35560.67s -> 35562.67s]  we're just going to dial it back and do a chill stream tomorrow.
[35562.67s -> 35565.81s]  He liked an old Tony Hawk game
[35565.81s -> 35567.81s]  better than Outer Wilds.
[35567.81s -> 35572.42s]  That's not fair, though.
[35572.42s -> 35574.42s]  Do I have any interest in Warcraft 3
[35574.42s -> 35576.42s]  Reforged? No.
[35576.42s -> 35578.42s]  Because I heard it sucks.
[35578.42s -> 35586.22s]  I heard
[35586.22s -> 35588.40s]  it's really not that
[35588.40s -> 35590.40s]  much of a reforging
[35590.40s -> 35592.40s]  and more of a repainting.
[35592.40s -> 35603.41s]  So I don't know
[35603.41s -> 35605.41s]  if I'm going to care that much about it.
[35605.41s -> 35607.41s]  It also
[35607.41s -> 35610.03s]  it also does not give me
[35610.03s -> 35612.03s]  very much confidence in what
[35612.03s -> 35614.03s]  Diablo 4 is going to look like.
[35614.03s -> 35623.95s]  From my understanding
[35623.95s -> 35625.95s]  it's kind of
[35625.95s -> 35627.95s]  stripped a bunch of stuff from it.
[35627.95s -> 35629.95s]  The graphics really aren't that good.
[35629.95s -> 35632.13s]  They didn't really remake
[35632.13s -> 35634.13s]  very much. They kind of upped some textures
[35634.13s -> 35636.13s]  and some models, right?
[35636.13s -> 35647.46s]  Custom maps you don't own anymore.
[35647.46s -> 35649.46s]  It belongs to Blizzard. Well, you know why they're
[35649.46s -> 35651.46s]  doing that, right? You know
[35651.46s -> 35653.46s]  why they're doing the custom games or
[35653.46s -> 35655.46s]  ours? Because look what happened
[35655.46s -> 35659.68s]  to Dota. Dota was
[35659.68s -> 35661.68s]  created in one of their IPs.
[35661.68s -> 35664.11s]  And it
[35664.11s -> 35666.11s]  created one of the biggest video
[35666.11s -> 35668.11s]  game genres
[35668.11s -> 35670.99s]  on Earth. And they couldn't
[35670.99s -> 35672.99s]  take it. They couldn't control it.
[35672.99s -> 35677.79s]  So in their minds
[35677.79s -> 35679.79s]  what they're probably thinking is if another
[35679.79s -> 35681.79s]  Dota comes up in these custom
[35681.79s -> 35684.48s]  games, we will own it.
[35684.48s -> 35697.09s]  No one's going to make custom games
[35697.09s -> 35699.90s]  now. I would probably jump on
[35699.90s -> 35701.90s]  and mess around in tower defense. That was
[35701.90s -> 35703.90s]  one of my favorite things to do.
[35703.90s -> 35705.90s]  Tower defense, hero line wars.
[35705.90s -> 35708.14s]  It was a lot of fun.
[35708.14s -> 35710.14s]  But you kind of take away the incentive
[35710.14s -> 35712.83s]  to make a
[35712.83s -> 35715.14s]  game mode for us.
[35715.14s -> 35717.14s]  Make a new fun custom game.
[35717.14s -> 35719.31s]  But if anyone ever thinks
[35719.31s -> 35721.81s]  it's good, you can't
[35721.81s -> 35723.81s]  have it. It's ours.
[35723.81s -> 35727.65s]  You're ours now.
[35727.65s -> 35730.98s]  Custom game Golden Age
[35730.98s -> 35732.98s]  is long over. People just download Unity and Unreal.
[35732.98s -> 35734.98s]  But they actually have the chance to
[35734.98s -> 35736.98s]  make money. That's also another really good point.
[35736.98s -> 35738.98s]  That's a good point. That's a great point actually.
[35738.98s -> 35741.79s]  That you can just make
[35741.79s -> 35743.79s]  your own game now.
[35743.79s -> 35745.79s]  There's a lot of tools now that were sort of out of reach.
[35745.79s -> 35747.79s]  Some 15, 20 years ago.
[35747.79s -> 35760.08s]  I've played Beautiful Joe.
[35760.08s -> 35762.08s]  I have. They're amazing games.
[35762.08s -> 35764.08s]  Both of them.
[35764.08s -> 35766.38s]  Some of the best
[35766.38s -> 35768.38s]  GameCube and PS2 games.
[35768.38s -> 35770.38s]  Love them.
[35770.38s -> 35772.38s]  And they are behind me.
[35772.38s -> 35774.38s]  They're in two cases behind me. We're going to play them
[35774.38s -> 35781.87s]  very soon.
[35781.87s -> 35783.87s]  But let's keep going before it gets too late.
[35783.87s -> 35788.86s]  But thank you. That was Bulbaswag.
[35788.86s -> 35791.62s]  Thank you for the $9.99.
[35791.62s -> 35793.62s]  Rastnama, thanks for the 500 bits.
[35793.62s -> 35795.62s]  The first stream I've been able to catch.
[35795.62s -> 35797.62s]  Busy with college and life. I've been watching your stuff on YouTube for a while.
[35797.62s -> 35799.62s]  Glad I can actually catch a stream for even a small
[35799.62s -> 35801.62s]  while.
[35801.62s -> 35807.30s]  Appreciate you, Jerma. Glad to have you.
[35807.30s -> 35809.30s]  Thanks for stopping by and thanks for
[35809.30s -> 35813.12s]  $5.
[35813.12s -> 35815.12s]  One Trick Gaming, thanks for the five community subs.
[35815.12s -> 35817.42s]  Enyaz, thanks for the
[35817.42s -> 35819.42s]  $5.00. 500 bits.
[35819.42s -> 35821.66s]  Jerma, I'm a recent fan.
[35821.66s -> 35824.03s]  Since about October.
[35824.03s -> 35826.03s]  Cool. Welcome.
[35826.03s -> 35828.03s]  I'm giving you bits tonight as your Dreamcast video that just went up
[35828.03s -> 35830.03s]  was the only thing keeping me from falling into shock
[35830.03s -> 35832.03s]  because I just discovered a family member
[35832.03s -> 35834.03s]  took their life this morning.
[35834.03s -> 35836.03s]  That's horrible. I'm really sorry to hear that.
[35836.03s -> 35841.47s]  I am so sorry to hear that.
[35841.47s -> 35845.12s]  I'm in the UK studying abroad
[35845.12s -> 35847.12s]  in university. I'm away from my family
[35847.12s -> 35849.12s]  who live in the west of Ireland.
[35849.12s -> 35851.49s]  And your voice is keeping me calm.
[35851.49s -> 35853.49s]  So I needed to say thanks and keep doing you.
[35853.49s -> 35857.84s]  Enyaz, you're about to go
[35857.84s -> 35859.84s]  through, and you currently are going
[35859.84s -> 35861.84s]  through, a very, very, very, very difficult
[35861.84s -> 35865.74s]  time. Stay strong.
[35865.74s -> 35869.07s]  That's a really
[35869.07s -> 35874.13s]  terrible thing to happen.
[35874.13s -> 35876.13s]  Seek guidance if you need to.
[35876.13s -> 35883.28s]  Breathe.
[35883.28s -> 35885.71s]  Keep your head on your shoulders. That's tough.
[35885.71s -> 35889.94s]  Thank you so much for the
[35889.94s -> 35891.94s]  $500 bits.
[35891.94s -> 35893.94s]  I wish you and your family the best.
[35893.94s -> 35901.10s]  Thank you again.
[35901.10s -> 35911.86s]  We have five community subs from
[35911.86s -> 35917.42s]  Ferlitty. Thank you
[35917.42s -> 35920.24s]  Ferlitty. And just to touch on that
[35920.24s -> 35922.54s]  one more time about something.
[35922.54s -> 35924.54s]  I've been
[35924.54s -> 35926.54s]  fairly fortunate in my life
[35926.54s -> 35928.72s]  to not have somebody
[35928.72s -> 35930.72s]  potentially close to me pass away
[35930.72s -> 35935.65s]  suddenly. I can't imagine
[35935.65s -> 35937.65s]  the pain that
[35937.65s -> 35949.04s]  people could be feeling when that happens.
[35949.04s -> 35951.04s]  We joke around a lot and we fuck around
[35951.04s -> 35956.54s]  a lot on this stream
[35956.54s -> 35961.02s]  and stuff like that. I'm just
[35961.02s -> 35963.02s]  really, really, really sorry.
[35963.02s -> 35965.71s]  I cannot even imagine.
[35965.71s -> 35968.91s]  As I think about my life, you think about
[35968.91s -> 35970.91s]  what you and people
[35970.91s -> 35972.91s]  that you know that you've maybe seen
[35972.91s -> 35974.91s]  or done things with or grown up with.
[35974.91s -> 35977.79s]  I think that's why a lot of
[35977.79s -> 35981.89s]  people can feel
[35981.89s -> 35983.89s]  because you put yourself in that scenario.
[35983.89s -> 35989.58s]  Somebody said
[35989.58s -> 35991.58s]  life's unpredictable. Be safe.
[35991.58s -> 35995.30s]  Just do your best.
[35995.30s -> 35998.11s]  Do the best you can. That's all you can do.
[35998.11s -> 36002.78s]  I just wanted to kind of
[36002.78s -> 36004.78s]  say something else about that
[36004.78s -> 36006.78s]  because that's
[36006.78s -> 36009.22s]  not fun.
[36009.22s -> 36011.22s]  That's tough stuff.
[36011.22s -> 36014.16s]  The best you can is good enough. That's true.
[36014.16s -> 36017.30s]  Just do the best you can.
[36017.30s -> 36023.70s]  But SquimPST
[36023.70s -> 36025.70s]  gave 400 bits.
[36025.70s -> 36027.70s]  I've been wheel throwing this whole stream
[36027.70s -> 36029.70s]  and all I can think about is Bugleberry Pottery
[36029.70s -> 36031.70s]  ASMR, so thank you for that.
[36031.70s -> 36036.50s]  Nice.
[36036.50s -> 36041.10s]  You got a wheel? I imagine that would be
[36041.10s -> 36043.10s]  really, really relaxing just to throw on like a
[36043.10s -> 36045.10s]  TV show or a YouTube video
[36045.10s -> 36047.41s]  or stream and just wheel throw.
[36047.41s -> 36050.10s]  You can just sit there for
[36050.10s -> 36052.10s]  hours doing it.
[36052.10s -> 36056.00s]  Your viewers just plummeted to zero.
[36056.00s -> 36060.74s]  It's kind of just like a
[36060.74s -> 36062.74s]  neat little trick.
[36062.74s -> 36064.74s]  You know what I mean?
[36064.74s -> 36066.74s]  I know that I can do it.
[36066.74s -> 36068.74s]  But I can't do it as well as a lot of people
[36068.74s -> 36072.50s]  that are very, very good at it.
[36072.50s -> 36074.50s]  So it's almost just like a
[36074.50s -> 36076.50s]  neat little thing
[36076.50s -> 36078.50s]  that I can just turn on sometimes.
[36078.50s -> 36080.80s]  You look at some professional beatboxers
[36080.80s -> 36082.80s]  and you're like,
[36082.80s -> 36085.04s]  I'm going to beatbox
[36085.04s -> 36087.98s]  and I'm going to beatbox
[36087.98s -> 36091.38s]  and I'm going to beatbox
[36091.38s -> 36093.38s]  You look at some professional beatboxers
[36093.38s -> 36095.87s]  they run circles around the stuff that I'm doing.
[36095.87s -> 36099.33s]  So capitalize
[36099.33s -> 36101.33s]  on an album. I don't
[36101.33s -> 36103.33s]  I'm not sure. It's kind of just like a hobby
[36103.33s -> 36105.33s]  thing. I just do it sometimes. I'll be in the shower
[36105.33s -> 36115.25s]  just doing it. But I
[36115.25s -> 36117.25s]  appreciate the fact that you think that it's good enough to
[36117.25s -> 36119.87s]  do that. You have the first
[36119.87s -> 36121.87s]  beatboxing gamer.
[36121.87s -> 36124.30s]  There are probably others.
[36132.99s -> 36134.99s]  I was initially a little
[36134.99s -> 36136.99s]  It was a little tough hearing my own voice in recordings
[36136.99s -> 36138.99s]  but I'm gradually getting used to it.
[36138.99s -> 36140.99s]  If you have any tips for a newcomer, I'd appreciate them.
[36140.99s -> 36142.99s]  Thanks for being you.
[36142.99s -> 36146.32s]  Something I learned a long
[36146.32s -> 36148.62s]  time ago is
[36148.62s -> 36150.62s]  do what you want to do.
[36150.62s -> 36153.63s]  It can get really, really
[36153.63s -> 36155.63s]  tricky.
[36155.63s -> 36157.63s]  You can kind of get in your own way
[36157.63s -> 36160.96s]  when you start to think about
[36160.96s -> 36162.96s]  instead of what you would want to do, what would
[36162.96s -> 36170.06s]  somebody else want to do.
[36170.06s -> 36172.06s]  Try not to compare yourself to other people.
[36172.06s -> 36174.06s]  That's also tough too because you're like oh
[36174.06s -> 36176.06s]  this person and me and this person do this
[36176.06s -> 36178.06s]  and how many people watch?
[36178.06s -> 36180.06s]  How many people sub to that person?
[36180.06s -> 36182.06s]  How many viewers do they have on YouTube?
[36182.06s -> 36184.06s]  Their videos are better than mine.
[36184.06s -> 36186.06s]  No they're not. I gotta make a better video. I gotta try
[36186.06s -> 36188.06s]  to make a better video than them. You can get
[36188.06s -> 36190.88s]  lost. Do you
[36190.88s -> 36193.12s]  do what you want to do and stock
[36193.12s -> 36196.58s]  up on baby food. The last part is
[36196.58s -> 36207.33s]  not a joke. We add
[36207.33s -> 36209.33s]  $30
[36209.33s -> 36211.33s]  Yeah 3000 bits from
[36211.33s -> 36213.33s]  Go Ike
[36213.33s -> 36218.51s]  $30 fucking dollars. It's a lot of money.
[36218.51s -> 36221.46s]  They say skate or die. Skate or die.
[36221.46s -> 36223.95s]  Thanks for the huge amount of money. That's 30
[36223.95s -> 36226.77s]  bucks. Is that a college tip?
[36226.77s -> 36229.46s]  No it's a streamer tip. That's a real
[36229.46s -> 36232.27s]  streamer tip. Alright so it's been
[36232.27s -> 36234.27s]  10 hours. You hear me out on this. This is very important.
[36234.27s -> 36236.27s]  It's been 10
[36236.27s -> 36238.27s]  hours of this stream being turned on.
[36238.27s -> 36243.90s]  I've gotten up from the chair a couple times.
[36243.90s -> 36245.90s]  I peed but I'm back here in about
[36245.90s -> 36247.90s]  2 minutes, 3 minutes each time.
[36247.90s -> 36250.53s]  10 hours and like
[36250.53s -> 36252.53s]  5 minutes of time
[36252.53s -> 36254.53s]  not on camera or not
[36254.53s -> 36258.37s]  on broadcast.
[36258.37s -> 36260.37s]  You gotta eat something. You gotta drink something.
[36260.37s -> 36262.37s]  You gotta have something available.
[36262.37s -> 36265.06s]  We've been here for 10 hours. Baby food.
[36265.06s -> 36268.32s]  Those little baby food packets
[36268.32s -> 36270.32s]  or even the little jars.
[36270.32s -> 36272.32s]  You can eat those in 5 seconds.
[36272.32s -> 36274.56s]  You know how easy it is to drink
[36274.56s -> 36276.56s]  just to slurp down one of those baby food
[36276.56s -> 36278.80s]  packets? It's got
[36278.80s -> 36280.80s]  vitamins. It's got fruits. It's
[36280.80s -> 36282.80s]  real shit. It's food. It's
[36282.80s -> 36287.28s]  just liquified. It's bananas.
[36287.28s -> 36289.28s]  Apples.
[36289.28s -> 36294.91s]  I'm not joking. No.
[36294.91s -> 36297.34s]  Stay here.
[36297.34s -> 36359.66s]  Okay.
[36359.66s -> 36383.44s]  Let me fix this. Okay.
[36383.44s -> 36385.44s]  So those of you that said this was not real.
[36385.44s -> 36390.35s]  It is. It's very real.
[36390.35s -> 36393.04s]  This is apple
[36393.04s -> 36395.92s]  banana. This is real.
[36395.92s -> 36398.16s]  Apple, banana, fruit on the go.
[36398.16s -> 36400.16s]  All natural. No spoon. You just twist
[36400.16s -> 36405.15s]  the shit off. Apple, banana,
[36405.15s -> 36407.15s]  fruit on the go. This is designed
[36407.15s -> 36409.15s]  for small children. Look at how small
[36409.15s -> 36416.77s]  this is. You give these
[36416.77s -> 36419.97s]  pouches to kids.
[36419.97s -> 36421.97s]  It's baby food. It's not baby
[36421.97s -> 36427.14s]  food. I mean,
[36427.14s -> 36429.14s]  who's gonna eat this?
[36429.14s -> 36431.44s]  Besides a baby. Who do you
[36431.44s -> 36433.44s]  know that's going to eat this besides a baby
[36433.44s -> 36436.70s]  or a toddler? Me.
[36436.70s -> 36465.68s]  Look at how simple this is. Done.
[36465.68s -> 36470.46s]  I just ate a full meal in
[36470.46s -> 36472.46s]  12 seconds.
[36472.46s -> 36482.69s]  Done. I can keep going.
[36482.69s -> 36486.34s]  A full baby meal.
[36486.34s -> 36488.34s]  Yeah, but a full baby meal is still a full
[36488.34s -> 36490.34s]  meal for somebody.
[36490.34s -> 36492.34s]  A full baby meal can keep
[36492.34s -> 36494.34s]  you going for another couple hours on live stream.
[36494.34s -> 36498.69s]  Or beef jerky.
[36498.69s -> 36503.62s]  I'm not crazy.
[36503.62s -> 36510.72s]  Everybody else is. It's really good.
[36510.72s -> 36514.69s]  And they're fucking so fast. It's easy.
[36514.69s -> 36516.69s]  You gotta find, streamer
[36516.69s -> 36518.69s]  tip, streamer
[36518.69s -> 36520.69s]  tip.
[36520.69s -> 36522.69s]  Find something that you can eat, that you can eat
[36522.69s -> 36524.69s]  quickly, that you can snack on.
[36524.69s -> 36526.69s]  Crackers. You know.
[36526.69s -> 36529.68s]  Cheese. Baby food.
[36529.68s -> 36531.68s]  Fucking go-go squeezers.
[36531.68s -> 36535.01s]  I don't think I was making this up.
[36535.01s -> 36539.68s]  You just eat an apple.
[36539.68s -> 36542.24s]  You know how long
[36542.24s -> 36544.24s]  it takes to eat a fucking apple?
[36544.24s -> 36546.24s]  It takes like 20 minutes
[36546.24s -> 36548.93s]  to eat a full apple. You have to
[36548.93s -> 36552.26s]  like, hey guys!
[36554.62s -> 36557.82s]  What do I do with the core? I got this like, fuck
[36557.82s -> 36559.82s]  my hands are all sticky. No. I just did it.
[36559.82s -> 36563.28s]  You gotta like sit there and eat it
[36563.28s -> 36565.28s]  and spin it around. The core is all
[36565.28s -> 36571.04s]  fucked up and gross.
[36571.04s -> 36573.04s]  You can eat the core. Don't eat, don't eat the-
[36573.04s -> 36575.04s]  Listen. Somebody just said that. Don't eat the fucking core
[36575.04s -> 36577.04s]  of an apple. Don't do that.
[36577.04s -> 36579.04s]  Why would you? Don't eat the core of an apple.
[36579.04s -> 36582.30s]  The core is- Don't eat the core of an apple.
[36582.30s -> 36584.30s]  Why would you don't eat the core of an apple? It's like
[36584.30s -> 36590.56s]  rawhide.
[36590.56s -> 36592.56s]  The police are coming to
[36592.56s -> 36594.56s]  take you somewhere
[36594.56s -> 36597.12s]  to get to hell.
[36597.12s -> 36599.12s]  It's fu- It's apple
[36599.12s -> 36601.12s]  sauce, guys.
[36601.12s -> 36603.12s]  The number one ingredient is apples
[36603.12s -> 36605.12s]  bananas. It's apple sauce
[36605.12s -> 36607.12s]  in a little jar.
[36607.12s -> 36609.12s]  It's not a big deal.
[36609.12s -> 36614.43s]  It's literally 70 calories.
[36614.43s -> 36617.38s]  Yeah. It's 70 fucking
[36617.38s -> 36619.38s]  calories of super
[36619.38s -> 36621.38s]  ultra hyper energy. Alright, I'm done.
[36621.38s -> 36623.74s]  I can't believe nobody wants to hear my fucking
[36623.74s -> 36625.74s]  tip. I've been doing this for a day. I've been doing this
[36625.74s -> 36627.92s]  I've been doing this for 10 years.
[36627.92s -> 36629.92s]  You don't think I've figured some secrets?
[36629.92s -> 36632.93s]  Some secrets seem strange.
[36632.93s -> 36636.45s]  I've been doing this for a decade. I think
[36636.45s -> 36644.70s]  I've learned a few secrets.
[36644.70s -> 36649.44s]  They're so good. Thank you. I'm so glad
[36649.44s -> 36651.44s]  that there's a human in here that can
[36651.44s -> 36663.79s]  back me up a little.
[36663.79s -> 36665.79s]  It's human detected.
[36665.79s -> 36668.48s]  I like these things.
[36668.48s -> 36670.48s]  They're really easy. And it's like
[36670.48s -> 36672.48s]  100 calories and then you drink
[36672.48s -> 36674.48s]  like a glass of fucking almond milk
[36674.48s -> 36676.48s]  and you've had like 200-
[36676.48s -> 36678.48s]  It's just a snack. You know something? Guys, I'm not
[36678.48s -> 36680.48s]  talking about like eating a full plate of
[36680.48s -> 36682.48s]  spaghetti. I'm talking about
[36682.48s -> 36684.48s]  just a little something to like- Oh, I need
[36684.48s -> 36687.87s]  something. A little something.
[36687.87s -> 36691.39s]  Alright, let's finish the bitch. I said
[36691.39s -> 36693.39s]  it's a full meal for a fucking child.
[36693.39s -> 36695.39s]  Okay, it's a full meal for a child. It is.
[36695.39s -> 36697.39s]  It's not- Alright, whatever. I lied.
[36697.39s -> 36709.68s]  I got it wrong. It's a full meal
[36709.68s -> 36711.68s]  for you. You lied. Stop
[36711.68s -> 36716.74s]  lying, you-
[36716.74s -> 36718.74s]  It's perfect for me. It just is. Alright, we're gonna
[36718.74s -> 36720.74s]  move on from this. You give
[36720.74s -> 36722.74s]  some secrets. You know, I gotta start
[36722.74s -> 36724.74s]  holding on to my secrets.
[36724.74s -> 36726.74s]  I can't tell everybody my secrets now.
[36726.74s -> 36728.74s]  Because then they'll- I mean, I gotta- These are my secrets.
[36728.74s -> 36730.74s]  What do you think I do when I go downstairs?
[36730.74s -> 36733.42s]  I go-
[36733.42s -> 36735.42s]  drink a glass of water and I shake around
[36735.42s -> 36737.42s]  a little. I like shake my body.
[36737.42s -> 36739.42s]  I move my back up and down. I do some stretches
[36739.42s -> 36741.42s]  for my costochondritis and I come back upstairs.
[36741.42s -> 36746.54s]  Call me weird, that's fine.
[36746.54s -> 36750.00s]  It's been 10 hours.
[36750.00s -> 36752.62s]  And I'm- I'm good. A little tired.
[36752.62s -> 36754.62s]  A little cranky. I'm good.
[36754.62s -> 36756.62s]  Maybe need a little nap. Might need a
[36756.62s -> 36759.12s]  bubble later, but I'm good.
[36759.12s -> 36761.12s]  Hey, Appleship, thanks for 250.
[36761.12s -> 36766.29s]  Appreciate it. Uh, yo, have you heard
[36766.29s -> 36768.29s]  the new Gorillaz song? I have not.
[36768.29s -> 36770.29s]  Something I will do immediately when
[36770.29s -> 36775.47s]  turning this off. It slaps.
[36775.47s -> 36778.74s]  I'll have to hear it. Dark Soul,
[36778.74s -> 36780.74s]  thanks for the 250. Gap Gaming
[36780.74s -> 36782.74s]  here to let you know this is a fake funny
[36782.74s -> 36784.74s]  ad, just to let everybody know this is not real.
[36784.74s -> 36786.74s]  Uh, Gap Gaming here to let you gappers know
[36786.74s -> 36788.74s]  we think this stream is pretty rad.
[36788.74s -> 36790.74s]  That's why we're gonna step
[36790.74s -> 36792.74s]  it up and donate these 250 bits so we can
[36792.74s -> 36794.74s]  scoop some totally epic gear from our store.
[36794.74s -> 36796.74s]  Oh, I got some- I have baby burps
[36796.74s -> 36798.74s]  coming. Use code
[36798.74s -> 36800.74s]  BAMTHEMAN for 20% off your next order
[36800.74s -> 36806.56s]  of knee pads. What does everybody
[36806.56s -> 36808.99s]  say? Everybody said something funny in here.
[36808.99s -> 36814.11s]  What did they say? I see people
[36814.11s -> 36816.11s]  tagging somebody. They said something funny. What did they
[36816.11s -> 36824.43s]  say? That was heavy info
[36824.43s -> 36826.86s]  to drop on us. The baby
[36826.86s -> 36830.45s]  thing? Holy shit, 20
[36830.45s -> 36832.45s]  pouches is only $10.
[36832.45s -> 36835.65s]  Somebody's figuring this out
[36835.65s -> 36837.65s]  in real time, and
[36837.65s -> 36841.81s]  I'm so glad that they are.
[36841.81s -> 36843.81s]  Somebody is figuring this all out,
[36843.81s -> 36845.81s]  and I'm just so happy. You know when you just
[36845.81s -> 36847.81s]  know you're right and you have a secret
[36847.81s -> 36849.81s]  and you just know what you're saying
[36849.81s -> 36851.81s]  is correct and nobody believes you?
[36851.81s -> 36860.77s]  That's not a good value.
[36860.77s -> 36862.77s]  Jar of applesauce is like $3.
[36862.77s -> 36864.77s]  This is not a jar of applesauce. This is apples,
[36864.77s -> 36866.77s]  bananas,
[36866.77s -> 36868.77s]  and lemon juice. It gives you a little
[36868.77s -> 36870.77s]  kick. You don't have that in regular applesauce.
[36870.77s -> 36884.14s]  What about granola bars? Those are
[36884.14s -> 36887.92s]  great too. You just pick the thing
[36887.92s -> 36889.92s]  that you like. And I like go-go squeezers,
[36889.92s -> 36891.92s]  apple, banana, fucking lemon juice,
[36891.92s -> 36893.92s]  little kick. Squeezers!
[36893.92s -> 36897.38s]  The Glare, thanks for 10 community subs.
[36897.38s -> 36899.38s]  Appreciate it.
[36899.38s -> 36903.66s]  Thank you, Fel6 for the 5 community subs.
[36903.66s -> 36908.40s]  Appreciate it. Both of you.
[36908.40s -> 36912.11s]  Back to back there. Oops, thanks
[36912.11s -> 36914.11s]  for 500 bits. For the record. Somebody said
[36914.11s -> 36916.74s]  for the record, Angela
[36916.74s -> 36929.92s]  Anaconda.
[36929.92s -> 36934.14s]  Holy shit. Yeah, this is like
[36934.14s -> 36936.14s]  I... What network
[36936.14s -> 36947.79s]  was this show on?
[36947.79s -> 36950.22s]  Was it on Nickelodeon?
[36950.22s -> 36952.22s]  I distinctly remember seeing this show.
[36952.22s -> 36954.22s]  This show was weird.
[36954.22s -> 36961.07s]  Yeah, it was weird picture,
[36961.07s -> 36963.07s]  real life picture, stop motion
[36963.07s -> 36965.07s]  kind of animation stuff, right?
[36965.07s -> 36967.07s]  They just used
[36967.07s -> 36969.07s]  real photos of people and animated them?
[36969.07s -> 36975.92s]  Yeah, that was a weird show. Yeah.
[36975.92s -> 36979.42s]  Thank you, Hoops.
[36979.42s -> 36981.42s]  Thanks for the 500 bits.
[36993.42s -> 37002.90s]  Drink a better
[37002.90s -> 37004.90s]  beer.
[37004.90s -> 37009.50s]  You guys are gonna fucking kill me.
[37009.50s -> 37011.50s]  I have like my boomer brace
[37011.50s -> 37024.94s]  on.
[37033.04s -> 37035.04s]  Yeah, that was fun because chat loves to antagonize
[37035.04s -> 37037.04s]  and cyber bully you.
[37037.04s -> 37039.04s]  It was meant to be nothing more than a throw away goof
[37039.04s -> 37041.04s]  you happen to notice. That said,
[37041.04s -> 37043.04s]  I'm still sifting through some old streams. What were you
[37043.04s -> 37052.45s]  saying? I'm the guy who
[37052.45s -> 37054.45s]  joked about you snapping on stream.
[37054.45s -> 37059.57s]  Yeah, and then I was like, yo, why is
[37059.57s -> 37061.57s]  that? I said, and what do you think
[37061.57s -> 37064.96s]  that is? I remember that.
[37064.96s -> 37072.75s]  Snapping his fingers.
[37072.75s -> 37074.75s]  Uh oh, he's gonna fucking snap.
[37074.75s -> 37086.58s]  You are fussy.
[37086.58s -> 37088.94s]  That was fun. I especially
[37088.94s -> 37090.94s]  like the part where I couldn't get over the wall.
[37090.94s -> 37095.55s]  When I couldn't get over the wall and everybody was screaming
[37095.55s -> 37097.55s]  mean things
[37097.55s -> 37102.10s]  at me. Everyone get down. He's about
[37102.10s -> 37108.50s]  to snap.
[37108.50s -> 37112.21s]  Baker. We always do that.
[37112.21s -> 37115.73s]  I know. I just
[37115.73s -> 37117.97s]  give it back.
[37117.97s -> 37119.97s]  I can't, I can't jab back.
[37119.97s -> 37122.91s]  I jab back.
[37122.91s -> 37124.91s]  I jab back.
[37124.91s -> 37126.91s]  2020 Jerma jabs back.
[37126.91s -> 37133.81s]  Gotta be careful.
[37133.81s -> 37135.81s]  Hey, 101 dominations thanks for 250.
[37135.81s -> 37139.84s]  With all the money coming in, if we don't see Danny
[37139.84s -> 37141.84s]  DeVito in one of your streams, we're going to explode.
[37141.84s -> 37143.84s]  Jokes aside, love
[37143.84s -> 37147.55s]  your streams. Keep it up.
[37147.55s -> 37149.92s]  I don't know if that will happen,
[37149.92s -> 37151.92s]  but it would be really funny if it did.
[37151.92s -> 37155.50s]  Is Jerma Merc the worst emote?
[37155.50s -> 37157.50s]  No, JermaTV is. Or JermaBald.
[37157.50s -> 37159.50s]  The bald coin one.
[37159.50s -> 37162.64s]  Keith King Crimson, your skater
[37162.64s -> 37164.64s]  looks like Angela Anaconda.
[37164.64s -> 37167.14s]  Thanks for the 250. Yeah, that is
[37167.14s -> 37171.04s]  pretty accurate. Silent Serenity
[37171.04s -> 37173.04s]  thanks for 250, Silent Serenity. Imagine if
[37173.04s -> 37175.04s]  your childhood friend stole your jokes. We got this one already,
[37175.04s -> 37177.04s]  but it's funny. Imagine if your
[37177.04s -> 37179.04s]  childhood friend stole your jokes and got more Twitch
[37179.04s -> 37181.04s]  subs than you. Would you let him win?
[37181.04s -> 37184.62s]  Um, it would be really hard
[37184.62s -> 37186.62s]  to beat that person in a clown off
[37186.62s -> 37188.62s]  because no matter what, that person's
[37188.62s -> 37190.62s]  audience would always see me as the pretender.
[37190.62s -> 37194.34s]  It would just never work.
[37194.34s -> 37205.47s]  I could give documented evidence
[37205.47s -> 37207.47s]  and it would be like, yeah, I know,
[37207.47s -> 37211.25s]  but I'm already subbed
[37211.25s -> 37213.42s]  to this guy, so
[37213.42s -> 37215.79s]  and I like him.
[37215.79s -> 37217.79s]  I don't like you. I don't even know who the fuck
[37217.79s -> 37219.79s]  you are.
[37219.79s -> 37221.79s]  But I'm the funny one. I'm the funny guy.
[37221.79s -> 37223.79s]  Yeah, but are you though?
[37223.79s -> 37226.35s]  I like him. I've been
[37226.35s -> 37228.35s]  watching him for five years.
[37228.35s -> 37230.78s]  He's gonna come in here and
[37230.78s -> 37232.78s]  blow up this whole community like this?
[37232.78s -> 37235.54s]  No. No, maybe I'll
[37235.54s -> 37242.45s]  give you a follow. Jerma sure does
[37242.45s -> 37244.45s]  seem to know how this would all play out.
[37244.45s -> 37247.52s]  That's just human nature, isn't it?
[37247.52s -> 37255.01s]  Carlos Mencio
[37255.01s -> 37257.01s]  stole everybody's jokes and
[37257.01s -> 37259.01s]  he was one of the most popular comedians ever.
[37259.01s -> 37261.01s]  Like, nobody cared.
[37261.01s -> 37272.21s]  God, he existed.
[37272.21s -> 37278.03s]  He immediately became less popular.
[37278.03s -> 37280.03s]  I don't know if it was immediate.
[37280.03s -> 37282.66s]  I think that took a long, that took a while.
[37282.66s -> 37284.66s]  That took a lot longer than I think you remember.
[37284.66s -> 37290.48s]  He still had a bunch of, he still
[37290.48s -> 37292.48s]  had his TV show. He was still touring.
[37292.48s -> 37296.90s]  Joe Rogan made him disappear.
[37296.90s -> 37308.74s]  No, he
[37308.74s -> 37315.26s]  Alright, how many seasons of
[37315.26s -> 37317.26s]  Mind of Mencio were there?
[37317.26s -> 37319.26s]  Mind of Mencio.
[37319.26s -> 37323.62s]  There were four seasons
[37323.62s -> 37328.48s]  of this show. Now, he wasn't around
[37328.48s -> 37330.48s]  for like a year. He was around for like five
[37330.48s -> 37333.36s]  plus years before
[37333.36s -> 37335.36s]  anybody really, really took it
[37335.36s -> 37337.36s]  to him to get rid of like, oh, you were
[37337.36s -> 37343.50s]  a joke stealer.
[37343.50s -> 37349.14s]  Fridl Schlintz
[37349.14s -> 37351.14s]  Thanks for the 250. Please turn the light on in your room.
[37351.14s -> 37353.14s]  You'll ruin your eyes staring at a bright screen in the dark.
[37353.14s -> 37355.44s]  I am in a bright room.
[37355.44s -> 37366.77s]  Goiki gave
[37366.77s -> 37368.77s]  Goiki gave 20 community subs.
[37368.77s -> 37371.39s]  We caught it, but that's a lot of subs.
[37371.39s -> 37375.42s]  Thank you, Goiki.
[37375.42s -> 37382.98s]  Really appreciate that.
[37382.98s -> 37384.98s]  You came out as a baby on this stream.
[37384.98s -> 37386.98s]  Say goodbye to any future sponsorships.
[37386.98s -> 37388.98s]  Unless it's from Gerber's Baby Food.
[37388.98s -> 37390.98s]  Have you ever seen a sponsorship on this stream
[37390.98s -> 37392.98s]  that wasn't a joke?
[37392.98s -> 37396.75s]  Of us pretending there was one?
[37396.75s -> 37398.75s]  Has this stream ever been sponsored once by anything?
[37398.75s -> 37400.75s]  That we're not making a pretend I'm
[37400.75s -> 37403.63s]  sponsored joke?
[37403.63s -> 37406.77s]  I don't think that's going to be an issue for me.
[37406.77s -> 37413.42s]  I think I'll be okay.
[37413.42s -> 37417.78s]  But that being said, Go Go Squeezers
[37417.78s -> 37420.08s]  are the best.
[37420.08s -> 37422.08s]  So is JetBlue. You should fly it every time you fly on an airplane.
[37422.08s -> 37426.82s]  And Ridgewallets
[37426.82s -> 37430.08s]  are good. I like it.
[37430.08s -> 37432.08s]  Out of those three, I mean if you're listening
[37432.08s -> 37436.86s]  I'm here
[37436.86s -> 37439.17s]  I talk. I like to meme and chat.
[37439.17s -> 37441.17s]  We go back. We jab back and forth.
[37441.17s -> 37443.17s]  We have like this little fun banter thing going on.
[37443.17s -> 37447.39s]  They call me short.
[37447.39s -> 37449.39s]  And I like scream at them.
[37449.39s -> 37457.97s]  It's fun. I eat baby food
[37457.97s -> 37459.97s]  in front of them and they call me a weirdo.
[37459.97s -> 37466.62s]  Don't you want to sponsor this stream?
[37466.62s -> 37468.62s]  Don't you want to like give a bunch of money to this stream?
[37468.62s -> 37478.54s]  Why wouldn't you?
[37478.54s -> 37480.54s]  Most impressive babies too.
[37480.54s -> 37483.36s]  Nah, I'm just fucking around. I'm just messing around.
[37483.36s -> 37487.58s]  Don't worry.
[37487.58s -> 37489.58s]  Isaac?
[37489.58s -> 37491.58s]  Isaac, thanks for the 5000
[37491.58s -> 37493.58s]  bits. That stupid fart special
[37493.58s -> 37495.58s]  made me laugh harder than anything else in a long time.
[37495.58s -> 37497.58s]  Thanks for the fun stream. Thanks for watching.
[37497.58s -> 37500.98s]  Thanks for spending time here.
[37500.98s -> 37503.28s]  Thanks for giving me a very large
[37503.28s -> 37506.16s]  amount of money. Glad you got some laughs.
[37506.16s -> 37509.30s]  Thank you.
[37509.30s -> 37513.26s]  Five community subs, Kip. Lazy
[37513.26s -> 37515.26s]  Purple. What's going on Lazy Purple?
[37515.26s -> 37517.76s]  Lazy Purple, you still here? It's late.
[37517.76s -> 37519.76s]  Last second bits because that was honestly the funniest
[37519.76s -> 37521.76s]  stream I ever caught. Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate that you pushed
[37521.76s -> 37524.64s]  through and beat it. Thanks a lot, dude.
[37524.64s -> 37529.89s]  You are still here.
[37529.89s -> 37536.67s]  I should probably do this.
[37536.67s -> 37542.75s]  You got
[37542.75s -> 37544.75s]  VIP. Let's go.
[37544.75s -> 37546.75s]  Newest VIP. Lazy Purple.
[37546.75s -> 37556.14s]  Bane?
[37556.14s -> 37558.14s]  Lazy Purple is an old YouTuber.
[37558.14s -> 37560.77s]  Made a lot of TF2 content.
[37560.77s -> 37562.77s]  Funny guy.
[37562.77s -> 37571.34s]  Well, I used the term old because
[37571.34s -> 37574.61s]  we're talking like
[37574.61s -> 37580.94s]  six, seven, eight years ago.
[37580.94s -> 37582.94s]  He still does.
[37582.94s -> 37584.94s]  I'm just saying he's an old
[37584.94s -> 37587.25s]  YouTube. He didn't start his YouTube channel
[37587.25s -> 37589.25s]  three days ago. He's been around for a long
[37589.25s -> 37591.74s]  time. He's an old YouTuber.
[37591.74s -> 37593.74s]  He's an old TF2 YouTuber.
[37593.74s -> 37600.78s]  That's accurate.
[37600.78s -> 37602.78s]  Lazy Purple was making videos I think before I was.
[37602.78s -> 37605.22s]  Like in 2010 or something.
[37605.22s -> 37607.22s]  When did you start your channel?
[37607.22s -> 37609.46s]  2011? 2012?
[37609.46s -> 37616.42s]  Something like that.
[37616.42s -> 37620.90s]  That's a good question.
[37620.90s -> 37623.58s]  Oh, yeah. You really are
[37623.58s -> 37627.04s]  a baby. July
[37627.04s -> 37629.04s]  21st, 2010.
[37629.04s -> 37631.54s]  That's a year before I started
[37631.54s -> 37634.86s]  YouTube. So, yeah.
[37634.86s -> 37636.86s]  You've been around a long time.
[37636.86s -> 37641.90s]  Thanks for watching. Glad to have you.
[37641.90s -> 37644.85s]  Five community subs
[37644.85s -> 37646.85s]  from Chef SCT. Thanks for the
[37646.85s -> 37648.85s]  five subs. Aw, futz. Thanks for the
[37648.85s -> 37652.24s]  $11.
[37652.24s -> 37654.24s]  Hi, Jermis. I want to say thanks for everything.
[37654.24s -> 37656.24s]  Past year has been one of the hardest years of my
[37656.24s -> 37658.24s]  life. And the main thing keeping me afloat
[37658.24s -> 37660.24s]  and positive are your streams and the chat.
[37660.24s -> 37662.24s]  Hi, chat. Thank you
[37662.24s -> 37664.24s]  so much for everything and a fantastic stream tonight. Have
[37664.24s -> 37666.24s]  a great rest of your night. You as
[37666.24s -> 37669.50s]  well. We've got a fun group of
[37669.50s -> 37675.01s]  people here. This community is one of the
[37675.01s -> 37682.05s]  best. At its very core,
[37682.05s -> 37684.05s]  there's a lot of really, really,
[37684.05s -> 37689.55s]  really great people here.
[37689.55s -> 37691.55s]  The channel has grown
[37691.55s -> 37693.55s]  so much in the last two years.
[37693.55s -> 37695.92s]  I'm surprised it still can
[37695.92s -> 37697.92s]  stay kind of like this.
[37697.92s -> 37701.89s]  Once a channel
[37701.89s -> 37703.89s]  typically, I mean,
[37703.89s -> 37705.89s]  we've seen the kind of the growth
[37705.89s -> 37707.89s]  of a bunch of new people that are coming
[37707.89s -> 37709.89s]  in and just the chat
[37709.89s -> 37711.89s]  goes much faster. It's
[37711.89s -> 37713.89s]  harder to pay attention to what people are saying.
[37713.89s -> 37715.89s]  I mean, there's typically
[37715.89s -> 37717.89s]  nowadays there's
[37717.89s -> 37719.89s]  four to six thousand
[37719.89s -> 37721.89s]  concurrent viewers on this stream.
[37721.89s -> 37726.18s]  Even a year or two ago, there was like
[37726.18s -> 37728.18s]  two thousand, maybe.
[37728.18s -> 37730.18s]  Two years ago, this
[37730.18s -> 37732.18s]  stream was at like eighteen hundred
[37732.18s -> 37734.18s]  to like twenty five hundred concurrent.
[37734.18s -> 37737.31s]  We've grown like three times
[37737.31s -> 37739.31s]  the audience in a year
[37739.31s -> 37743.34s]  and a half. But even still, it
[37743.34s -> 37746.74s]  still is, it's
[37746.74s -> 37750.26s]  still fun. It's not getting
[37750.26s -> 37752.26s]  corrupted. Not that it would
[37752.26s -> 37754.26s]  for really any reason, but
[37754.26s -> 37761.30s]  he's viewbotting.
[37761.30s -> 37767.82s]  Why would I ever do that?
[37767.82s -> 37774.03s]  And yeah, we've had some
[37774.03s -> 37776.03s]  growing pains on this channel.
[37776.03s -> 37778.03s]  Nothing anything major, but anytime
[37778.03s -> 37780.03s]  any channel grows this
[37780.03s -> 37782.27s]  quickly, you know, even for me,
[37782.27s -> 37784.27s]  like I'm trying to find
[37784.27s -> 37786.27s]  ways to moderate the channel better,
[37786.27s -> 37790.11s]  figure out how to
[37790.11s -> 37792.11s]  have a community this large and what to do,
[37792.11s -> 37794.11s]  how to be fair.
[37794.11s -> 37796.11s]  We've seen like the bit minimum
[37796.11s -> 37798.11s]  increase, right? Like that's something
[37798.11s -> 37800.11s]  I didn't really want to do, but I did.
[37800.11s -> 37802.67s]  All this stuff
[37802.67s -> 37804.67s]  has kind of only happened within the last two
[37804.67s -> 37810.93s]  years, but I still
[37810.93s -> 37812.93s]  love it. I'm still having a great time.
[37812.93s -> 37814.93s]  I'm glad there's people here that enjoy it too.
[37814.93s -> 37822.93s]  I worry about the implications
[37822.93s -> 37824.93s]  behind gifted subs. What do you mean?
[37824.93s -> 37827.81s]  Implications behind gifted subs?
[37827.81s -> 37831.46s]  Like people, there's a
[37831.46s -> 37833.46s]  lot of gifted subs and they'll
[37833.46s -> 37841.58s]  what do you mean? Trolls become
[37841.58s -> 37846.70s]  subs. Yeah, but that's
[37846.70s -> 37848.70s]  most people that are coming here, they're
[37848.70s -> 37850.70s]  just fucking around. They're not
[37850.70s -> 37854.22s]  I don't think of maybe
[37854.22s -> 37856.22s]  a few times in
[37856.22s -> 37858.22s]  five years on Twitch
[37858.22s -> 37860.22s]  have I really thought that there was a problem
[37860.22s -> 37862.22s]  in the chat, like a real one.
[37862.22s -> 37864.46s]  Not something that could be, you know,
[37864.46s -> 37866.46s]  fixed with a spam filter or
[37866.46s -> 37870.05s]  I don't think, it's been a while
[37870.05s -> 37872.05s]  since I think that there's been a
[37872.05s -> 37874.05s]  real, I've had it like, let me just put it
[37874.05s -> 37876.05s]  this way. I'm not sure there's been
[37876.05s -> 37878.05s]  a point where I've had a real
[37878.05s -> 37880.05s]  problem with something going on in chat.
[37880.05s -> 37882.05s]  Like a real problem with somebody
[37882.05s -> 37884.05s]  or
[37884.05s -> 37886.48s]  I don't, that just doesn't really happen
[37886.48s -> 37899.34s]  that often here. What were the problems?
[37906.46s -> 37908.46s]  Sometimes the channel, sometimes it can get a little
[37908.46s -> 37910.46s]  out of control with, somebody will come
[37910.46s -> 37912.46s]  in and say something
[37912.46s -> 37914.46s]  really, really fucked up, whether it's something
[37914.46s -> 37916.46s]  just ridiculously
[37916.46s -> 37918.46s]  offensive, racist
[37918.46s -> 37920.46s]  shit. Somebody will just drop a bunch
[37920.46s -> 37922.46s]  of terrible shit and it's like, okay, we gotta
[37922.46s -> 37926.69s]  deal with this. Sometimes
[37926.69s -> 37928.69s]  the spam can get a little
[37928.69s -> 37932.46s]  out of control. But that's
[37932.46s -> 37934.46s]  not that big of a deal because
[37934.46s -> 37936.46s]  it's easily correctable.
[37936.46s -> 37946.13s]  But this community,
[37946.13s -> 37948.13s]  they all, you guys all
[37948.13s -> 37950.13s]  think usually the same things
[37950.13s -> 37952.13s]  are interesting
[37952.13s -> 37954.13s]  or funny or
[37954.13s -> 37956.82s]  there's not a whole lot of split
[37956.82s -> 37958.82s]  up groups of people in this community
[37958.82s -> 37960.82s]  that don't like each other or don't
[37960.82s -> 37962.82s]  agree with each other or think, you know what I mean?
[37962.82s -> 37964.82s]  There's not that many people.
[37964.82s -> 37968.34s]  Well, the Dru crew is less
[37968.34s -> 37977.81s]  than a hundred people. I should do a poll
[37977.81s -> 37980.11s]  one day.
[37980.11s -> 37982.11s]  He still thinks that.
[37982.11s -> 37984.11s]  Don't you see the long game
[37984.11s -> 37986.11s]  I'm playing here, guys?
[37986.11s -> 37988.59s]  Come on.
[37988.59s -> 37990.59s]  This is some serious
[37990.59s -> 37992.59s]  6,000 go go squeeze brain
[37992.59s -> 37994.59s]  IQ
[37994.59s -> 38000.74s]  long play. This is a long
[38000.74s -> 38003.68s]  con because the more
[38003.68s -> 38005.68s]  the more that we talk
[38005.68s -> 38007.68s]  about, oh, there's not that many people
[38007.68s -> 38009.68s]  in the Dru crew.
[38009.68s -> 38011.68s]  No, of course not.
[38011.68s -> 38013.68s]  No, there's like 10 people in it.
[38013.68s -> 38015.68s]  They get members and
[38015.68s -> 38018.30s]  they get members and then I can
[38018.30s -> 38020.30s]  stream Nancy Drew
[38020.30s -> 38022.30s]  whenever I want
[38022.30s -> 38024.74s]  because all of you will be in
[38024.74s -> 38027.10s]  the Dru crew and I can
[38027.10s -> 38029.10s]  stream the 250 game
[38029.10s -> 38031.10s]  catalog and everyone
[38031.10s -> 38039.81s]  will be for it. Oh, no,
[38039.81s -> 38041.81s]  not my master plan.
[38041.81s -> 38048.85s]  I'm not even sure there is that many Nancy Drew games.
[38048.85s -> 38050.85s]  You're a megalomaniac. You psycho.
[38050.85s -> 38053.98s]  You monster.
[38053.98s -> 38055.98s]  No, I love the Dru crew.
[38055.98s -> 38057.98s]  Their enthusiasm is encouraging.
[38057.98s -> 38060.54s]  Makes me happy.
[38060.54s -> 38066.42s]  It really does.
[38066.42s -> 38073.39s]  Play this like a fiddle.
[38073.39s -> 38075.39s]  We love you. Watching you play Diablo
[38075.39s -> 38077.39s]  is my favorite.
[38077.39s -> 38079.39s]  Outer Wilds was the second.
[38079.39s -> 38081.39s]  I mean, we're playing Diablo 2 tomorrow.
[38081.39s -> 38083.39s]  Get ready. Tomorrow's stream, by the way, is going to be
[38083.39s -> 38087.94s]  very, very laid back.
[38087.94s -> 38089.94s]  We're just going to
[38089.94s -> 38091.94s]  I say that, but I'm probably going to be really tense
[38091.94s -> 38093.94s]  trying to fight Diablo.
[38093.94s -> 38095.94s]  Ah, another battery fell.
[38095.94s -> 38098.88s]  Why am I covered in batteries?
[38098.88s -> 38101.38s]  Yeah, it's going to be just chill tomorrow.
[38101.38s -> 38103.38s]  If I beat Diablo and
[38103.38s -> 38106.06s]  or if I die
[38106.06s -> 38108.06s]  let's say I die
[38108.06s -> 38110.06s]  at some point during that stream.
[38110.06s -> 38112.06s]  I'm going to try not to, but it's pretty possible.
[38112.06s -> 38114.06s]  Especially Act 5 is going to be hard.
[38114.06s -> 38117.07s]  We'll just do Asura's Wrath DLC.
[38117.07s -> 38119.07s]  Like if the D2 segment
[38119.07s -> 38121.07s]  if I cannot beat Act 5
[38121.07s -> 38123.63s]  then, you know,
[38123.63s -> 38125.63s]  if two or three hours have gone by, we'll just do Asura's Wrath.
[38125.63s -> 38133.04s]  We'll see.
[38133.04s -> 38135.04s]  Let's get the credits rolling.
[38135.04s -> 38137.04s]  Roll those credits.
[38137.04s -> 38140.30s]  Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[38140.30s -> 38144.46s]  Thanks for another long one.
[38144.46s -> 38146.46s]  Ten and a half, ten and a half, ten and a half,
[38146.46s -> 38148.46s]  ten and a half, something like that.
[38148.46s -> 38158.56s]  Almost eleven, almost.
[38158.56s -> 38160.56s]  We were talking about that earlier.
[38160.56s -> 38162.56s]  About how something goes, say, in like sixty, seventy hour weeks.
[38162.56s -> 38167.55s]  That's so tough.
[38167.55s -> 38169.55s]  That's so much time.
[38169.55s -> 38172.30s]  I really hope you're either making good money
[38172.30s -> 38178.19s]  or you're making progress, you know?
[38178.19s -> 38183.95s]  Here come the credits.
[38183.95s -> 38185.95s]  Seventy hours.
[38185.95s -> 38187.95s]  We're talking about like five twelve hour days
[38187.95s -> 38189.95s]  or something, like six twelve,
[38189.95s -> 38195.14s]  ten twelve hour days.
[38195.14s -> 38197.14s]  Rarely worth it to work that much.
[38197.14s -> 38200.34s]  Just take care of yourselves.
[38200.34s -> 38202.34s]  If you really are working that much more than like fifty plus hours a week,
[38202.34s -> 38204.34s]  sixty hours a week,
[38204.34s -> 38213.10s]  I really hope you're taking care of yourself.
[38213.10s -> 38215.10s]  That's what it takes to get through residency.
[38215.10s -> 38218.50s]  Yeah, nobody should work that much.
[38218.50s -> 38221.49s]  Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[38221.49s -> 38223.49s]  It really is unfortunate.
[38223.49s -> 38228.99s]  Sometimes it's not a choice.
[38228.99s -> 38235.71s]  If you like working that much,
[38235.71s -> 38237.71s]  yeah, then, I mean,
[38237.71s -> 38239.71s]  some people really love to stay busy
[38239.71s -> 38241.95s]  and doing their job or their work
[38241.95s -> 38243.95s]  is very fulfilling and they love it.
[38243.95s -> 38245.95s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[38245.95s -> 38247.95s]  But even still, like, that's a lot.
[38247.95s -> 38250.32s]  Sixty hours,
[38250.32s -> 38252.32s]  seventy hours a week for a job.
[38252.32s -> 38255.90s]  Because you can start to burn out.
[38255.90s -> 38257.90s]  You can burn out like the sun.
[38257.90s -> 38268.98s]  Like I told you back when I was
[38268.98s -> 38270.98s]  working before
[38270.98s -> 38272.98s]  YouTube or Twitter or anything,
[38272.98s -> 38274.98s]  you know, when I was working
[38274.98s -> 38276.98s]  full time, it was
[38276.98s -> 38279.60s]  thirty, thirty five, forty,
[38279.60s -> 38281.60s]  maybe max, like thirty five.
[38281.60s -> 38284.74s]  Even then, I can't imagine
[38284.74s -> 38287.23s]  doubling that shit.
[38287.23s -> 38294.46s]  That's a lot of time.
[38294.46s -> 38296.46s]  I thought he showed that after four weeks, sixty hours
[38296.46s -> 38298.46s]  a week becomes as productive
[38298.46s -> 38300.46s]  as forty hour weeks.
[38300.46s -> 38302.46s]  It's stupid to work people like that.
[38302.46s -> 38304.46s]  Yeah, there's a lot of
[38304.46s -> 38306.46s]  research out there about
[38306.46s -> 38308.64s]  shorter. And I'm a proponent
[38308.64s -> 38310.88s]  of this as well.
[38310.88s -> 38312.88s]  You are more productive
[38312.88s -> 38314.88s]  the less you work.
[38314.88s -> 38319.10s]  Working three or four
[38319.10s -> 38321.10s]  eight hour days
[38321.10s -> 38323.10s]  is more productive than working
[38323.10s -> 38325.10s]  seven six hour days, seven five hour
[38325.10s -> 38340.34s]  days in a row. Because
[38340.34s -> 38342.34s]  this is how I feel as well. I mean, this is
[38342.34s -> 38344.34s]  getting a little existential here, I think.
[38344.34s -> 38347.02s]  But if somebody
[38347.02s -> 38350.22s]  is happy and they have
[38350.22s -> 38352.22s]  time to spend,
[38352.22s -> 38354.72s]  don't you think that they would do a better job?
[38354.72s -> 38357.28s]  Right? Don't you think that
[38357.28s -> 38359.28s]  they would do a better job if
[38359.28s -> 38361.28s]  they had three days off,
[38361.28s -> 38364.74s]  four days off a week?
[38364.74s -> 38366.74s]  Going to work and they would be like, alright, like
[38366.74s -> 38368.74s]  I'm ready, like
[38368.74s -> 38372.19s]  I'm ready to go. I'm a huge
[38372.19s -> 38374.19s]  proponent of productivity
[38374.19s -> 38376.19s]  versus time.
[38376.19s -> 38379.14s]  Effective use of time
[38379.14s -> 38381.14s]  rather than hours of time.
[38381.14s -> 38388.11s]  There are tons of studies that
[38388.11s -> 38390.11s]  confirm this. Yeah,
[38390.11s -> 38392.11s]  it's really true. I wish we would
[38392.11s -> 38394.11s]  pull back to like a four
[38394.11s -> 38396.11s]  day work week. We'd do so much
[38396.11s -> 38398.11s]  good for so many people.
[38398.11s -> 38400.11s]  We wouldn't even lose out on anything.
[38400.11s -> 38409.97s]  Ow! Oh, that hurt.
[38409.97s -> 38412.85s]  That actually hurt.
[38412.85s -> 38416.62s]  Oh! My mic just
[38416.62s -> 38418.62s]  why did, what the fuck? Hold on.
[38418.62s -> 38420.99s]  My mic just like unscrewed.
[38420.99s -> 38430.66s]  My mic just unscrewed
[38430.66s -> 38432.66s]  and I like tried, it was like gonna fall.
[38432.66s -> 38434.90s]  It was like loose or something.
[38434.90s -> 38436.90s]  I just like stubbed my fingernail.
[38436.90s -> 38440.29s]  Oh, the retch are
[38440.29s -> 38442.78s]  cutting his mic.
[38442.78s -> 38444.78s]  I don't even think it's about money though. Like you can
[38444.78s -> 38447.28s]  if you're more productive, you'll make
[38447.28s -> 38449.28s]  more money. If your workers are more
[38449.28s -> 38451.28s]  productive, you're gonna make more money.
[38451.28s -> 38453.28s]  If your workers like what they do for work
[38453.28s -> 38455.28s]  and they enjoy coming into work, they're gonna
[38455.28s -> 38457.46s]  do more work when you
[38457.46s -> 38463.28s]  ask them to. If I ever had
[38463.28s -> 38465.28s]  a company, like a real company
[38465.28s -> 38467.28s]  not like, oh, German 95, the
[38467.28s -> 38469.28s]  E-Clown dickhead. If I had a
[38469.28s -> 38471.28s]  real company with
[38471.28s -> 38473.28s]  like 50 employees or something,
[38473.28s -> 38475.28s]  none of you motherfuckers is working
[38475.28s -> 38481.94s]  more than four days a week. Like under
[38481.94s -> 38483.94s]  any circumstance. Unless of
[38483.94s -> 38487.26s]  course, if you
[38487.26s -> 38489.26s]  wanted to, like let's say you were like
[38489.26s -> 38491.26s]  can I get some more hours? I really, I'm
[38491.26s -> 38493.26s]  ready to go. I want to go like all, I want to go all
[38493.26s -> 38495.26s]  this week. Alright.
[38495.26s -> 38502.69s]  You got it. Let's go.
[38502.69s -> 38504.69s]  God, please hire me.
[38504.69s -> 38513.46s]  It'd be nice to like just run a big
[38513.46s -> 38515.46s]  company and have tons of money
[38515.46s -> 38517.46s]  and have a bunch of employees and
[38517.46s -> 38519.95s]  I would love to have like birthday parties
[38519.95s -> 38521.95s]  for people. Is it weird
[38521.95s -> 38523.95s]  that I think about this stuff? I would love to be like
[38523.95s -> 38525.95s]  the CEO and like have like a surprise
[38525.95s -> 38527.95s]  birthday party for
[38527.95s -> 38529.95s]  workers.
[38529.95s -> 38533.98s]  That would be so much fun.
[38533.98s -> 38537.44s]  And we'd bring like games in and stuff.
[38537.44s -> 38546.78s]  You'd be Michael from the office.
[38556.18s -> 38558.86s]  Gamer boss.
[38558.86s -> 38562.64s]  It would be that I, because
[38562.64s -> 38564.64s]  if you're happy and you
[38564.64s -> 38566.64s]  like where you work, then you're
[38566.64s -> 38568.64s]  going to want to work better
[38568.64s -> 38571.20s]  and harder. Not
[38571.20s -> 38573.20s]  work smarter, not harder.
[38573.20s -> 38575.20s]  Work smarter, not harder.
[38575.20s -> 38577.20s]  It's such a simple concept.
[38577.20s -> 38579.20s]  How is it so boring to so many
[38579.20s -> 38581.20s]  people that run companies?
[38581.20s -> 38595.34s]  But what about that
[38595.34s -> 38597.34s]  fifth and sixth day?
[38597.34s -> 38599.34s]  We're going to lose profits. No, you won't.
[38599.34s -> 38601.34s]  No, you won't. You'll make more money.
[38601.34s -> 38604.10s]  You'll make more money. I bet you you'll
[38604.10s -> 38606.10s]  make more money.
[38606.10s -> 38608.10s]  More money, you say? Yes, a lot
[38608.10s -> 38612.96s]  more money.
[38612.96s -> 38615.26s]  Maybe I'll think about this
[38615.26s -> 38617.26s]  all day work week.
[38617.26s -> 38619.26s]  More money, he said
[38619.26s -> 38621.26s]  more money, therefore I should probably do
[38621.26s -> 38628.88s]  it.
[38628.88s -> 38633.04s]  Make a company as a funny
[38633.04s -> 38635.04s]  bit. I would just go bankrupt.
[38635.04s -> 38637.04s]  I don't have the capital
[38637.04s -> 38641.39s]  to be able to rob
[38641.39s -> 38644.78s]  a bank. Come on, it's like midnight
[38644.78s -> 38650.03s]  man. But let's finish
[38650.03s -> 38652.03s]  the bits. I could go off on a tangent
[38652.03s -> 38654.03s]  of how work
[38654.03s -> 38656.03s]  productivity is more important
[38656.03s -> 38658.03s]  than numbers at the job
[38658.03s -> 38660.03s]  all day.
[38660.03s -> 38662.03s]  You give me like two fingers of whiskey
[38662.03s -> 38664.03s]  and sit me down.
[38664.03s -> 38666.03s]  I could talk to you about this for like
[38666.03s -> 38676.91s]  three hours.
[38676.91s -> 38680.05s]  Hey, the
[38680.05s -> 38683.31s]  point. Thanks for the
[38683.31s -> 38685.31s]  300 bits. Hey, German back. LOL, by the
[38685.31s -> 38687.31s]  way, these are a rare
[38687.31s -> 38689.31s]  those are
[38689.31s -> 38691.31s]  nevermind. Those are great. I eat
[38691.31s -> 38693.31s]  organic applesauce, squeeze things as a filler
[38693.31s -> 38695.31s]  too sometimes. They're fun, but also a lot
[38695.31s -> 38697.49s]  of plastic waste.
[38697.49s -> 38699.49s]  Anyways, I'm getting interested in what you
[38699.49s -> 38701.49s]  do. What do you listen to in music?
[38701.49s -> 38703.49s]  I really like Rush, to be honest.
[38703.49s -> 38705.49s]  You have like a top 10 bands
[38705.49s -> 38707.49s]  you listen to. Gorillaz?
[38707.49s -> 38709.49s]  Gorillaz? Gorillaz?
[38709.49s -> 38711.66s]  Whatever video game soundtrack
[38711.66s -> 38713.66s]  I think is interesting
[38713.66s -> 38715.66s]  at the time. Gorillaz?
[38715.66s -> 38718.61s]  Repeat the same
[38718.61s -> 38720.61s]  three anime intros 200
[38720.61s -> 38722.61s]  times each until I don't care anymore.
[38722.61s -> 38725.62s]  Gorillaz?
[38725.62s -> 38729.58s]  And
[38729.58s -> 38747.62s]  Mozart. I know, that's a
[38747.62s -> 38750.94s]  lie. I don't really listen to music.
[38750.94s -> 38754.32s]  We, I know, he
[38754.32s -> 38756.32s]  eats baby food and doesn't listen to music.
[38756.32s -> 38758.32s]  Okay, check box one, check box
[38758.32s -> 38760.32s]  two. He is a sociopath. I know
[38760.32s -> 38762.32s]  like if you were a doctor you'd probably be like you fucking
[38762.32s -> 38764.32s]  something wrong with you. I don't
[38764.32s -> 38766.32s]  really listen to, I don't really, I don't. I don't
[38766.32s -> 38772.27s]  listen to music that much.
[38772.27s -> 38777.46s]  He's a baby. Clip this
[38777.46s -> 38780.53s]  and show it to the doctor.
[38780.53s -> 38782.53s]  Thanks for the 300 bits, appreciate it.
[38782.53s -> 38784.53s]  Thanks for 250. Are you ever going to attempt The Royal Flush
[38784.53s -> 38786.53s]  yourself on stream after doing
[38786.53s -> 38792.54s]  some practice? Martin
[38792.54s -> 38794.54s]  had a meme thanks to 250. Hey there
[38794.54s -> 38796.54s]  Whittle Jeremy. Baby Gap
[38796.54s -> 38798.54s]  Gaming here. We're wondering if
[38798.54s -> 38800.54s]  you'd like to be sponsored by us instead of the big boy
[38800.54s -> 38802.54s]  Gap Gaming. We think our baby
[38802.54s -> 38804.54s]  products fit more in line with your mentality
[38804.54s -> 38806.54s]  and height.
[38806.54s -> 38809.30s]  Martin had a meme thanks for the pretend
[38809.30s -> 38811.30s]  we're joking around having
[38811.30s -> 38813.30s]  a good time post stream
[38813.30s -> 38815.30s]  having fun message.
[38815.30s -> 38817.98s]  Thank you.
[38817.98s -> 38819.98s]  Hey Shoesip thanks for the 300 bits.
[38819.98s -> 38821.98s]  Hey Jeremy I appreciate the content and streams helping me
[38821.98s -> 38823.98s]  through some tough times. Keep it up.
[38823.98s -> 38829.22s]  I wish you the best. Hopefully you get
[38829.22s -> 38831.22s]  through what you're going through with ease.
[38831.22s -> 38835.94s]  Hopefully it's not as hard.
[38835.94s -> 38837.94s]  Not sure whatever it is but I hope
[38837.94s -> 38840.50s]  you get through it. Thank you.
[38840.50s -> 38844.70s]  The 300 bits. And finally
[38844.70s -> 38847.84s]  let's get to the end.
[38847.84s -> 38849.84s]  This is the end.
[38849.84s -> 38852.46s]  Silent Serenity with 250.
[38852.46s -> 38855.41s]  Do you have a vent to Kim
[38855.41s -> 38857.41s]  about how chat bullies you?
[38857.41s -> 38863.73s]  No.
[38863.73s -> 38865.73s]  No I don't think so.
[38865.73s -> 38869.89s]  I think about that so well you guys
[38869.89s -> 38871.89s]  think I turn the stream off and I just like go in there and I'm like
[38871.89s -> 38873.89s]  let me fucking tell you something.
[38873.89s -> 38875.89s]  Man I'm so sick of that shit.
[38875.89s -> 38877.89s]  Like what the fuck did you see what they said
[38877.89s -> 38879.89s]  today? Were you reading when they
[38879.89s -> 38881.89s]  said that? They said like oh he's short
[38881.89s -> 38883.89s]  he's fucking stupid.
[38883.89s -> 38886.77s]  These motherfuckers
[38886.77s -> 38890.67s]  let me tell you
[38890.67s -> 38893.68s]  I don't not do that.
[38893.68s -> 38896.43s]  You know what happens when I turn the stream off
[38896.43s -> 38898.43s]  and I walk into the bedroom over there?
[38898.43s -> 38900.43s]  You know my first words to Kim are
[38900.43s -> 38902.43s]  usually every single time I turn the stream off.
[38902.43s -> 38912.86s]  What do you think it is?
[38912.86s -> 38914.86s]  It's I'm hungry.
[38914.86s -> 38917.30s]  What do you want to do for food?
[38917.30s -> 38919.30s]  Are you hungry? Have you eaten?
[38919.30s -> 38925.18s]  Do you feel like anything in particular?
[38925.18s -> 38927.18s]  Do you want to get
[38927.18s -> 38929.18s]  sushi or something? Do you want to get
[38929.18s -> 38931.18s]  Mediterranean?
[38931.18s -> 38934.45s]  Do you want pizza? I'm hungry.
[38934.45s -> 38940.02s]  It's midnight. Well yeah not tonight.
[38940.02s -> 38945.84s]  We went late tonight.
[38945.84s -> 38947.84s]  Typically the streams turn off around
[38947.84s -> 38949.84s]  9pm, 9, 10pm Pacific.
[38949.84s -> 38954.13s]  I stream for like
[38954.13s -> 38956.13s]  six and a half hours, seven hours typically.
[38956.13s -> 38958.13s]  So yeah it's like
[38958.13s -> 38960.75s]  eight, nine, nine o'clock.
[38960.75s -> 38962.75s]  You go late every night.
[38962.75s -> 38965.44s]  Only the last couple
[38965.44s -> 38967.44s]  weeks really have I been doing more than ten
[38967.44s -> 38969.44s]  hour streams.
[38969.44s -> 38973.02s]  That's a pretty recent thing.
[38973.02s -> 38975.02s]  It was very rare for me to go
[38975.02s -> 38977.02s]  over nine hours. Very rare.
[38977.02s -> 38983.22s]  But I'll see you
[38983.22s -> 38985.22s]  guys tomorrow for Diablo 2.
[38985.22s -> 38991.81s]  The streams have only been going long
[38991.81s -> 38993.81s]  when you start early. But that's, we talked about
[38993.81s -> 38995.81s]  that though. That's another big point.
[38995.81s -> 38997.81s]  Starting at like 1 to 2pm Pacific
[38997.81s -> 38999.81s]  the streams can just go longer because
[38999.81s -> 39001.81s]  it doesn't go until like 3am
[39001.81s -> 39003.81s]  Pacific.
[39003.81s -> 39005.81s]  Much easier to stay live when
[39005.81s -> 39007.81s]  it's not too late for every
[39007.81s -> 39011.71s]  single person.
[39011.71s -> 39013.71s]  But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[39013.71s -> 39015.71s]  Much love to you. Get some rest.
[39015.71s -> 39018.21s]  If we see you tomorrow, we see you tomorrow. If not
[39018.21s -> 39020.70s]  then maybe we'll see you again soon.
[39020.70s -> 39024.48s]  Take care and bye for now.
