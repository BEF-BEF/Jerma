[1.21s -> 11.10s]  Hello, how you doing? Welcome back. It's been about a week.
[11.10s -> 15.70s]  It's been almost exactly one full week since the stream was last live.
[15.70s -> 23.13s]  There's a lot to talk about. There's quite a few things to discuss.
[23.13s -> 29.37s]  Hope you had a good time on that show. It was uh, it was a ton of fun to do.
[29.37s -> 35.83s]  And before we get started, just right off the bat, every time there's a show that
[35.83s -> 38.71s]  happens, every time, oh I'm gonna do this big thing, whatever, and
[38.71s -> 43.85s]  get a bunch of people together and do a bunch of stuff. I almost get that,
[43.85s -> 47.61s]  like, it's over. No! It can't be, right? Like, we're gonna do another, we gotta
[47.61s -> 51.54s]  do like five more games. It's just, right? It's just like, oh that
[51.54s -> 56.81s]  was awesome! I had so much fun! Oh well, on to the next one, right?
[56.81s -> 60.73s]  Uh, so I'm in, I'm in one of those places right now where it's like, wow that was
[60.73s -> 64.55s]  so much fucking fun! God, all right, well that was cool. We'll
[64.55s -> 72.14s]  do another one. We'll do another one at some point.
[72.14s -> 78.25s]  But yeah, no, it was a ton of fun. I had a blast. Hopefully everybody else did too.
[78.25s -> 82.46s]  We had some technical problems in the middle of the stream, which
[82.46s -> 88.76s]  weirdly enough, when we changed Twitch ingest servers, it fixed it.
[88.76s -> 95.26s]  Something about the encoder, I have no idea. We'll have to figure that out.
[95.26s -> 99.53s]  And speaking of internet problems and streaming to Twitch right now,
[99.53s -> 113.21s]  apparently I'm dropping more frames. Why? I don't know. I wish I could tell you.
[113.21s -> 116.89s]  Well hey, but whoa, we got a really important first question. Do you still
[116.89s -> 126.41s]  have the mustache? Well, you're gonna have to find out.
[126.41s -> 134.20s]  You'll have to find out very soon. But speaking of ingest servers, do I need to
[134.20s -> 139.05s]  change now before I really get started? Because
[139.05s -> 147.42s]  it's not looking great. It's not looking great right now.
[147.42s -> 154.12s]  I mustached you a question. As a non-American, I don't know baseball, so I
[154.12s -> 166.20s]  was kind of lost. Well, I kind of figured that was gonna happen.
[166.20s -> 169.78s]  I might just restart the stream really quickly and change server.
[169.78s -> 177.78s]  Why do I have to keep doing this? I feel like I'm playing
[178.50s -> 181.38s]  Whack-a-mole with Twitch ingest servers lately.
[181.38s -> 194.06s]  What is going on here? That's what it feels like. I'll give it another five
[194.06s -> 198.74s]  seconds. Five minutes. He's leaving already.
[198.74s -> 203.64s]  No, I just said I have to go and play, I have to go play hopscotch
[203.64s -> 208.65s]  to four or five different servers until I don't drop frames anymore.
[208.65s -> 213.64s]  What is going on Twitch? What is happening here?
[213.64s -> 217.96s]  This is a new problem over the last like four to five months.
[217.96s -> 230.63s]  I don't get it. But anyways, yeah, it was a fantastic time.
[230.63s -> 233.59s]  Forget about the... I'm so glad that the first
[233.59s -> 237.50s]  three or four innings were fine and then we had that...
[237.50s -> 242.65s]  You should have seen what was going on up in the production truck.
[242.65s -> 247.24s]  Community Jake was assembling a new computer.
[247.24s -> 251.16s]  He was literally making a new computer. He was building a computer
[251.16s -> 254.84s]  up there because he was like, is it the video processor? Because we had three or
[255.00s -> 259.88s]  four straight innings. It was fine. It was the stream was perfect. No
[259.88s -> 263.22s]  problems at all. And then all of a sudden it was just like, what's going on?
[263.22s -> 266.42s]  So he built a whole computer up there and he's...
[266.42s -> 270.82s]  Apparently he switched ingest servers and fixed it.
[270.82s -> 275.30s]  But I mean, I'm just happy it was only for like an inning and a half
[275.30s -> 279.86s]  and not the whole thing. We have something really cool here.
[279.86s -> 283.56s]  So as I'm going to just kind of talk about the day, talk about kind of leading
[283.56s -> 286.12s]  up to it and everything. I'll look at... I'll answer pretty much any questions you
[286.12s -> 291.56s]  guys have and we'll go from here. But there are about 300 photos
[291.56s -> 296.36s]  that are going to be in a slideshow behind the scenes.
[296.36s -> 300.22s]  ResidentMod LeatherJacket took these photos.
[300.22s -> 307.22s]  It was really cool. And all right, I'm going to answer the burning question.
[307.22s -> 310.63s]  I'll answer. It's time to answer. Do you still have the mustache?
[310.63s -> 319.16s]  What do you think? Place your bets. Do you think it's still there? Is it still
[319.16s -> 331.35s]  there? What do you think? Let's take a vote. Let's take a vote. Yeah,
[331.35s -> 337.67s]  take a vote. Run a poll here. Do I still... I'm curious how many people think
[337.67s -> 343.27s]  no or yes. Let us gamble. Well, not gamble, but just like...
[343.27s -> 350.82s]  Do you think it's still there? All right, I'll run a poll. Okay, here we go.
[350.82s -> 362.39s]  Do you think it's still... Okay, yeah, you got it. Do you think I still have it?
[362.39s -> 367.77s]  Were you wearing ass paddings? No, that's my real ass.
[367.77s -> 374.87s]  Why would I... Okay, why would I put in ass paddings? Why would I do that?
[374.87s -> 379.85s]  That would be so strange. You know, being in the umpire gear in the first
[379.85s -> 383.70s]  place, having like the turtle armor on underneath is already kind of
[383.70s -> 388.01s]  enough. I had these huge leg pads that I was supposed to wear and I was like,
[388.01s -> 399.03s]  no, no thanks. No, thank you. It was just too bulky.
[399.03s -> 401.75s]  I did have a cup on though, so all the people that were saying,
[401.75s -> 405.03s]  holy shit dude, you are so lucky. What if you took one right into the balls?
[405.03s -> 410.42s]  I was wearing a cup. There's a clip circulating around
[410.42s -> 414.10s]  of me whacking myself with a bat in the balls. Yeah, I'm fine.
[414.10s -> 417.46s]  I had a cup on. I don't recommend you do that at home. Don't try that at home,
[417.46s -> 423.77s]  obviously. No, it's that you didn't. Why would I...
[423.77s -> 428.57s]  That's one thing I'm gonna protect, okay? What I told
[428.57s -> 433.69s]  everybody that was in production, I said make sure my face is good
[433.69s -> 436.25s]  and make sure my balls are good. Well, I didn't say that to them, but like I was
[436.25s -> 438.49s]  thinking that. Like, I don't care about anything else.
[438.49s -> 443.72s]  I could take a ball to the... I could take a ball to like the arm.
[443.72s -> 447.72s]  I could take a ball to the to the knee, to the chest, to the back.
[447.72s -> 451.43s]  I don't care. The face? You re-protect that.
[451.43s -> 455.03s]  And the balls? We protect those too, right? Like, I protect those.
[455.03s -> 458.55s]  That's it. Balls and face. That's all I care about. That's it.
[458.55s -> 468.01s]  And I had them protected. Anyways, all right, it's time to reveal.
[468.01s -> 471.61s]  Like, this is a big deal or not, but a lot of you think I still have it.
[471.61s -> 474.57s]  And you are absolutely incorrect. It's still there.
[474.57s -> 491.05s]  It's not as dark, I guess. It's still there! What if that was pre-recorded?
[491.05s -> 499.75s]  Could've been. All right, I'll play the real video now. It's still there.
[499.75s -> 504.71s]  So, there's gonna be kind of a little bit of a reveal here.
[504.71s -> 511.13s]  It's gonna be a little bit of a reveal. Yes, I had a mustache during this show
[511.13s -> 513.77s]  because I wanted one so that would be fun and interesting and funny.
[513.77s -> 518.92s]  Oh, he's got a big mustache. He's the mustache guy.
[518.92s -> 525.11s]  It was filled in. It was filled in. The makeup artist filled it in so it was darker.
[525.11s -> 530.09s]  I can't actually grow a real mustache like that. This is what it looks like. It's filled in.
[530.09s -> 543.24s]  Should I keep it? I don't think I can keep it. I really don't think so. Don't keep it.
[543.24s -> 546.36s]  But yeah, so this is... I'm just gonna let this slideshow play and we'll talk.
[546.36s -> 549.50s]  If I see something interesting to bring up, I think it'd be fun to talk about,
[549.50s -> 556.50s]  but I can't stress this enough. So anytime that a show like this happens,
[556.50s -> 563.03s]  where you're bringing in a bunch of people that don't understand Twitch and streaming culture,
[564.26s -> 566.50s]  so a lot of them did, but a lot of them didn't.
[566.50s -> 569.38s]  And trying to explain to people like, hey, we're doing this live thing.
[569.38s -> 571.85s]  This is what's gonna happen. This is what we're doing.
[571.85s -> 579.90s]  And from top to bottom of the order here, every performer, every player,
[579.98s -> 588.65s]  all the broadcasters in the broadcast booth, oh my God, they fucking killed it.
[588.65s -> 593.08s]  It didn't matter what position you were in. They were unfucking believable.
[593.08s -> 601.08s]  They were so funny and they were so good. I mean, yeah, there was obviously weeks of
[601.08s -> 605.96s]  preparation and we spent a few days talking to everybody and there was obviously a lot
[605.96s -> 612.95s]  of direction, right? But still, that was a lot of fun. That was absolutely a huge blast.
[612.95s -> 616.50s]  And I'm so happy that everybody had a great time and everybody did have a great time.
[616.50s -> 621.03s]  So I'd stamp it as that was a success. I mean, would I have liked to have had the
[621.03s -> 624.63s]  stream not turn off three or four times? Absolutely. And that's very frustrating.
[624.63s -> 631.45s]  But you have to take that out of the equation when everybody had so much fun.
[633.61s -> 636.73s]  I had the time of my life calling balls and strikes and just running around.
[637.37s -> 641.24s]  At the end of the day, I think it was a monumental success.
[641.24s -> 645.56s]  And I'm incredibly proud and happy of the entire team and every player, all the coaches,
[645.56s -> 651.46s]  the two coaches. They weren't baseball coaches. Those were actors.
[652.42s -> 655.78s]  We actually told, actually, why am I not letting this play? This has to play. All right, start
[655.78s -> 663.70s]  playing. So we told the coaches, hey, you're going to be a baseball coach. And they're like,
[663.70s -> 671.43s]  oh, that's really, really cool. That's awesome. I know a little bit about baseball, but not
[671.43s -> 677.38s]  really that much about baseball. Were they real teams? Yes, those were real players.
[677.38s -> 684.14s]  Ranging from college players to some of them saw some professional baseballs. I mean,
[684.22s -> 692.95s]  those were real players. Those weren't actors. It's going too fast. Hey, I'll pause. I'll pause
[692.95s -> 702.92s]  every so often. Here you go. I can hear the mustache move. And yeah, that Fansley with
[702.92s -> 708.18s]  the striker, I thought that was really funny. I thought that was really funny. And Fansley really
[708.18s -> 715.21s]  came through hard. Fansley was a huge supporter of the stream. And I got to make it clear to
[715.21s -> 720.54s]  everybody, stuff like this can't happen without support like that. It just can't.
[721.69s -> 724.81s]  The price tags on some of these shows, I don't really need to talk about them,
[724.81s -> 732.87s]  but they're astronomical sometimes. So I'm grateful and happy that sponsors actually
[732.87s -> 740.84s]  wanted to come through and do some of this stuff. It's not that it's hard to sell a show like this
[740.84s -> 745.56s]  to sponsors, but at the end of the day, it's like, oh yeah, we're going to do the circus
[745.56s -> 749.72s]  and magicians baseball show where I'm like an umpire. I don't know umpiring. I don't know
[749.72s -> 757.77s]  anything about that. I mean, I watched baseball when I was 17. It's like, oh, how much money is
[757.77s -> 763.22s]  this show? I get it. I do. But at the end of the day, we get support from the places we get them.
[763.22s -> 776.41s]  And it was awesome. I thought it flowed really well. Yeah. And everybody at Car Shield Field
[776.41s -> 781.86s]  in St. Louis, they were fantastic. They were so much fun to work with. They were so awesome.
[783.00s -> 789.75s]  Like I said, from top to bottom doesn't matter. Even the food, the delivery and stuff,
[789.75s -> 792.86s]  everything was just on point. Everything was perfect. It doesn't matter if you were
[793.42s -> 797.34s]  you know, a principal player or somebody on production or somebody that was
[798.14s -> 801.34s]  working behind the scenes of behind the scenes. Everybody doesn't matter who it was.
[801.34s -> 811.86s]  Why are you so red? Oh, because I have the action movie filter on from like two weeks ago.
[811.86s -> 819.21s]  Shave or I'm going to unsub. How about you relax? Look, you, you can, how about you,
[819.21s -> 824.54s]  you can unsub if you feel like it. You don't have to because I have a fucking gross mustache.
[824.54s -> 832.12s]  They're just making fucking deals. You know what I mean? There he is just making deals on the phone.
[832.12s -> 840.89s]  No, I was actually talking about it. I was talking to Holly. I love the mustache. It does look good.
[840.89s -> 851.06s]  There you go. Wait, wait, let's go back, back, back, back. So everybody, everybody that was on
[851.06s -> 857.66s]  the performance group, this is a bunch of performers. So people didn't realize that we,
[857.66s -> 865.90s]  it was not just baseball players. It was baseball players and it was like real circus performers
[865.90s -> 873.66s]  blended in. A lot of these guys did not see a single, a single time in the field. They
[873.66s -> 884.90s]  did not see a single ball. There were, I want to say we had 25 baseball players and like 12
[885.86s -> 892.71s]  performers. Like, like if, no, they were, they were 12 like circus type performers,
[892.71s -> 901.13s]  25 baseball players, five other actors. So yeah, there was a lot of moving parts here.
[902.14s -> 907.26s]  So anytime you saw something really interesting, like circus wise or some magic tricks or whatever,
[907.90s -> 914.92s]  that was not a baseball player and it flowed really, really well. Like I said,
[914.92s -> 920.30s]  who were the commentators? They were the best part of the whole show. Yeah, they were unbelievable.
[921.18s -> 926.78s]  And that, let me just go, they did all that based on, so I want to say probably like an hour or two,
[928.18s -> 934.78s]  an hour or two before the show is when I sat down with those two and really was like,
[934.78s -> 939.02s]  this is kind of what I'm looking for. This is kind of what the world that is here. This is the kind
[939.02s -> 941.90s]  of universe and here's what we're going to do. Here's what we're going to do. This is what you
[941.90s -> 946.36s]  guys should talk about. This is what you shouldn't talk about. They got maybe one hour of direction,
[946.36s -> 955.10s]  two hours of direction, and they carried that whole entire broadcast. They, were they confused?
[955.10s -> 963.27s]  No, no, they were on point. They were ready to go. They knew everything to say. Absolute kings. Oh
[963.27s -> 975.32s]  yeah. There was a lot of sexual innuendo. Well, you understand that we had a streaker with a
[975.32s -> 983.00s]  fansly integration. By the way, I need to confirm something right now. Very important,
[983.00s -> 989.11s]  most important time, most important thing of the entire show. You might have seen it on Twitter.
[989.11s -> 994.54s]  You might have seen it posted somewhere and you may cannot confirm that that's true.
[994.54s -> 1002.10s]  Paul Fondler has officially been unbanned. They are officially not banned from the channel.
[1002.10s -> 1011.66s]  They can post freely. Probably just going to get banned again, if I'm honest. I mean that, look,
[1011.66s -> 1017.02s]  when you get the get out of jail free card in Monopoly, that, you know, you can get out of jail
[1017.02s -> 1022.78s]  free, but that doesn't mean you can't go back to jail. It's not a get out of jail forever. So,
[1022.78s -> 1033.93s]  you could just go right back. People, oh wait, somebody, oh wait, people whooing Paul Fondler?
[1033.93s -> 1043.88s]  We're getting people actually, oh Megalel, whooing Paul Fondler. I'm, I can't believe that. I'm
[1043.88s -> 1053.21s]  actually surprised. Yeah, they were practicing juggling and stuff. Did you see the fire breather?
[1053.21s -> 1069.00s]  The fire breathing was fucking insane. Yeah, there was a lot of, and people were asking about
[1069.88s -> 1075.00s]  who were the people in the audience. So, we didn't, obviously, right, very obviously,
[1075.00s -> 1081.69s]  we didn't want people to know kind of immediately where we were for very obvious reasons, right?
[1081.69s -> 1088.66s]  It's just like, wait a minute, I live right down the street from Car Shield Field. Let's go. And
[1088.66s -> 1093.38s]  we obviously, it's, we're doing a show and we didn't want somebody to, like, you know, come on in and
[1093.38s -> 1097.30s]  be like, yeah, let's sit down. And they throw a fucking large soda onto the field and then,
[1097.30s -> 1101.61s]  you know, run. We didn't, obviously, want, didn't have that to happen. We had security at the event.
[1101.61s -> 1106.26s]  There was, we had private security there. So, I mean, they were obviously handling anything
[1106.26s -> 1112.90s]  that would come about. But they were, like, just random, I guess, kind of friends and family members
[1112.90s -> 1119.26s]  of whoever was there, whoever we kind of cleared to be there, I guess you'd say. So, that people
[1119.26s -> 1122.46s]  were wondering, like, who the fuck are these people in the audience? Like, how did they get there? Why
[1122.46s -> 1128.44s]  are they here? It's because they were, like, a private invite from one of the players or one
[1128.44s -> 1132.79s]  of the performers or whatever. They were, like, friends and family. That's what I figured, yeah.
[1132.79s -> 1143.46s]  So, that was fun. It was cool. Doing an event like this with an actual live audience would need a lot
[1143.46s -> 1153.18s]  more control of, I guess, the environment, not this community, Jake. You'll see in a few minutes
[1153.18s -> 1158.63s]  the amount of times that I, this, me and Jake had this, like, because I was down here and he was up
[1158.63s -> 1163.70s]  here. The amount of times that in between innings we both, like, came running down to each other,
[1163.70s -> 1168.90s]  like, to this weird cage that we were both separated by, was just like, hey, so what's going on? How
[1168.90s -> 1172.82s]  are we doing up there? How are we doing? Do you need anything down here? Yeah, yeah, no, I need
[1172.82s -> 1177.30s]  more balls to be supplemented down here. How's the video going in the truck? Like, we literally just
[1177.30s -> 1183.91s]  came down to, like, the blockage and then, like, and then turned around and ran. That happened to
[1183.91s -> 1190.71s]  almost every single in-between inning. Somebody said, I tried to get in, but I was denied. Well,
[1190.79s -> 1198.12s]  yeah, dude, like, what do you want me to say? You can't just, we can't just have anybody just come,
[1198.12s -> 1203.54s]  just come into the, just show up and run on the field. We already had a streaker. I don't need two.
[1203.54s -> 1211.77s]  There's the performers practicing again. And, yeah, some of the, my favorite shots of this whole thing
[1211.77s -> 1217.37s]  were when it would just randomly cut to one of the performers just standing on a ball in the outfield,
[1217.37s -> 1224.50s]  just standing there, just kind of, like, going, balancing on it on, like, the unicycles.
[1224.50s -> 1232.90s]  It was so funny, like, just randomly, like, why would you be back there doing that? Like,
[1232.90s -> 1237.30s]  that laptop, that was, like, glued to his hand the whole day. Of course, they had to have been,
[1237.30s -> 1242.44s]  right? So, this is, we were going over that. So, obviously, I don't want to break anybody's
[1242.44s -> 1249.02s]  immersion here, but we're going to. We're watching back the pre-recorded segment at the end of the
[1249.02s -> 1258.63s]  show, which those guys were so good, too. Like, those sports analyst guys at the desk, everybody
[1258.63s -> 1264.04s]  was so good. It was so fun. It wasn't live. Well, it wasn't live. Of course, it was a pre-recorded
[1264.04s -> 1270.63s]  show. That wasn't, the mime game wasn't currently a live broadcast. It was from the previous earlier
[1270.63s -> 1282.94s]  in the day or earlier in the week. The stream was fake. No, it was real. It was real enough.
[1282.94s -> 1286.68s]  But yeah, we were watching it back earlier in the day to make sure, like, okay, is it, like,
[1286.68s -> 1295.67s]  ready to go? It's ready to go. Yeah, we have, like, I think the best part. Oh, this is the makeup.
[1295.67s -> 1302.98s]  Yeah. You wouldn't believe how long it takes. It takes a long time to paint, like, 20 people's
[1302.98s -> 1310.95s]  faces in clown makeup. It actually takes a fairly long time. So, we had, like, two or three makeup
[1310.95s -> 1314.95s]  artists just cycling people in, all right, your turn, your turn, your turn. It took about, like,
[1314.95s -> 1327.99s]  two or three hours to do all this. Just wait till, just wait till I sit down and you see them fill
[1327.99s -> 1337.38s]  in my mustache. It was embarrassing. Do you still like balloons? Like, balloons tower defense? All
[1337.38s -> 1339.86s]  right, so this is, this is before the show. This is where we're just kind of preparing, because
[1339.86s -> 1343.24s]  this is the first time we had really everybody together, which you can't see over here, but
[1343.24s -> 1348.02s]  there's another probably 50 people sitting or 60 people or whatever total sitting in these seats.
[1348.02s -> 1354.92s]  And we were just kind of doing a full kind of production meeting. Okay, here we go. Let's do it.
[1354.92s -> 1358.76s]  And I hadn't eaten pretty much all day because I'm obviously just running around like crazy.
[1358.76s -> 1362.68s]  So, you're going to see a bunch of footage of me with this same salad in my hand for, like,
[1362.68s -> 1368.50s]  two to three hours. I don't know how many pictures there are of this, but it's a solid probably
[1369.22s -> 1373.82s]  two to three hours I was walking around with this. Because, you know, I'm just like, I'm just eating,
[1373.82s -> 1378.71s]  you know? There's no time to eat, right? There isn't. Anybody that's ever, like some of you guys
[1378.71s -> 1383.19s]  that know this, when you're like working on something and you're really in the zone and you
[1383.19s -> 1387.75s]  don't, you don't want to take any breaks, you're just, I'm ready to fucking go. Let's go, right?
[1389.27s -> 1393.75s]  Eating food sometimes is impossible because it's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta
[1393.75s -> 1399.40s]  eat food. No, that's gonna take like 30 minutes. I don't have time. Nope. No, no time for that.
[1399.40s -> 1405.06s]  I'll do it later. I'll eat later. So this is the, I'll eat later. This is probably, I want to say,
[1405.06s -> 1410.36s]  maybe an hour and 10 minutes before the show. So I'm just kind of like, well, maybe like two hours
[1410.36s -> 1415.10s]  or so. I'm just like walking around with like the salad. Like, yeah, okay, no, no, that looks good.
[1415.10s -> 1419.02s]  That looks good. We need you over here. Like just shoveling salad in my mouth. Salad's really easy
[1419.02s -> 1422.30s]  to eat on the go because it doesn't, here's the thing about a salad and those of you that are like
[1422.30s -> 1429.18s]  work kind of like on location and shit, like a chicken on salad, just like, you know, strips of
[1429.18s -> 1435.70s]  chicken with a salad cold as fuck. Cold. You can walk around with that for an hour or two. It's not
[1435.70s -> 1444.47s]  like, oh, no, no, no, I have to eat this hot sandwich or this hot bowl of, you know, quinoa
[1444.47s -> 1451.42s]  and like meat and shit. No, dude, if you're ever on the go like that, get yourself like a barbecue
[1451.42s -> 1456.44s]  chicken salad, a lot of greens in there, and you can walk around and eat that for two hours,
[1456.44s -> 1465.66s]  like I did. Yeah, and I presented with it. Looking back at this, this looks fucking weird now that
[1465.66s -> 1471.18s]  I'm like seeing this. This looks very strange. This looks like, why am I, this is actually kind
[1471.18s -> 1474.30s]  of strange when I'm thinking, when I'm looking back at this, me like, oh, like, okay, here's,
[1474.30s -> 1482.58s]  let's talk. All right, so I don't really like, let me explain. I don't really like dressing on
[1482.58s -> 1491.22s]  salads. I think it like kind of ruins the salad. It turns it into this weird mush. So I don't
[1491.22s -> 1502.28s]  usually use the salad dressing. So I like, I usually don't open the cup and when they put the cups in
[1502.28s -> 1513.51s]  there, it's like, sometimes I just leave them in just in case. What about croutons? Croutons are
[1513.51s -> 1521.88s]  fine. Yeah, we still drop. Yeah, we are. I don't get it. I don't get it. You know, I got to talk
[1521.88s -> 1527.94s]  to somebody at like Twitch, at like data or something, because I can't, I don't have any
[1527.94s -> 1533.26s]  idea what's going on. It doesn't make any sense. Across the board, like, they just hate, like,
[1533.26s -> 1539.00s]  they just hate the traffic that's coming from my channels. They just hate it. I don't get it.
[1539.00s -> 1546.87s]  I literally have ran speed tests, like upload, to upload servers for like 12 straight hours,
[1546.87s -> 1553.38s]  and it's a thousand, a thousand clean every time. It doesn't, I don't understand. I don't get it.
[1553.38s -> 1557.78s]  I have to like jump, jump, server, server, server switch, server switch, server switch, server switch,
[1557.78s -> 1565.08s]  server switch. All right, I got one. This one works. Conspiracy Andy. I'm just, I'm not saying
[1565.08s -> 1570.20s]  it's a conspiracy. I'm just saying like over the last six months, my traffic has been perfect on
[1570.20s -> 1578.17s]  my end, but some route that it takes to Twitch, it hates it. It hates me. It's not just you.
[1578.41s -> 1589.27s]  What the heck? Anyways, so get a big salad, and I'm not a conspiracy, that's not a conspiracy.
[1589.27s -> 1595.64s]  I mean, look, I'm dropping frames. All right, let's skip the like me eating food stuff. All right,
[1595.64s -> 1601.11s]  so yeah, we had everybody kind of lined up here, just hearing all the, you know what the best part
[1601.11s -> 1617.83s]  is? Hold on a minute. It's in character. Like the sad crying clown. These guys were amazing.
[1617.83s -> 1624.36s]  And also doing, okay, so this is a very serious meeting, and there's something about a very
[1624.36s -> 1628.90s]  serious meeting. Okay, guys, we're about two hours away from the show. My name's,
[1628.90s -> 1632.82s]  my name's German985. I know I've talked to you guys a lot over the last few weeks,
[1632.82s -> 1639.05s]  but here we are. Kind of like a, let's go kind of, let's talk session. And,
[1639.85s -> 1673.82s]  do I change to the Mexico server again? That's what fixed it the last time. Should I stream to
[1673.82s -> 1686.23s]  the Mexico Twitch server? Is that what I have to do again? He's fuming. Oh, I am fuming. This is,
[1686.63s -> 1691.59s]  fume. Why is he so red? Do you understand how much my, how hot my blood is? It's like 110 degrees.
[1691.59s -> 1702.28s]  But anyways, whatever. I was going to deal with it before we play, because this is like static
[1702.28s -> 1708.66s]  imagery. It's fine. Before I play in the game today, I'll switch. I can, I don't fucking understand.
[1708.66s -> 1718.81s]  I don't get it. All right. Anyways, let's go. So yeah. And, but what I was saying was doing a big
[1718.81s -> 1725.53s]  meeting with your, I'm standing down here, like here, like off camera, looking up and describing
[1725.53s -> 1730.09s]  to people. Okay. So then, by the way, when the streaker comes out, what we're going to have to
[1730.09s -> 1734.65s]  do is everyone's going to still continue playing and this guy's going to get naked. And you're
[1734.65s -> 1739.29s]  looking at a bunch of clown faces and a bunch of people that are just like, okay. It's just like,
[1739.29s -> 1745.58s]  what the fuck's happening? This is weird. This is a very strange conversation. But I live for that
[1745.58s -> 1754.82s]  shit though. This is like one of my favorite parts of every show is this. Like we're all actually
[1754.82s -> 1760.33s]  here and we're all actually going to do this is if some of my favorite part of an any show.
[1760.33s -> 1772.25s]  Is the mustache real? Well, you'll see. You'll see. It was real enough. Did I get to the end
[1772.25s -> 1775.93s]  of the salad? No, there's still some bread in there. Was there bread in it? I don't even remember.
[1775.93s -> 1787.70s]  Whatever is in here. It looks gross, but you have to just like kind of mix it together or whatever.
[1787.70s -> 1803.59s]  All right. It was, it was, I better not have any more fucking food in any of these photos.
[1803.59s -> 1815.32s]  Oh, that's so fucking funny. Yeah. So from up here, this is, yeah, this is me getting into my
[1816.12s -> 1822.87s]  people, people. I mean, umpire gear. Everyone's like, what is he fucking stupid? Why is he wearing
[1822.87s -> 1829.75s]  his umpire gear under his clothes? What is he dumb? He's a, he's a child. That's what you do.
[1829.75s -> 1836.62s]  You don't wear it over the clothes. It's, I'm not a, I'm not a, like you wear the armor under the
[1836.62s -> 1842.04s]  clothes. You wear your football pad. They don't wear the football pads over the jerseys. No,
[1842.04s -> 1852.31s]  you wear everything under the clothes. Why do I look so, what am I doing? Yeah. People are like,
[1852.31s -> 1856.79s]  oh yeah, dude. Like, I can't believe he's so dumb. He's wearing the armor under the clothes.
[1857.72s -> 1875.80s]  Yeah. That's how, where it goes. It's a bulletproof vest. It's why he's so red. I don't know, man.
[1875.80s -> 1885.40s]  Okay. So this is where I was getting my fake mustache filled in. Oh yeah. I kicked, I had to
[1885.40s -> 1891.10s]  kick this guy out. I felt really bad because I had to be done because they had to mic me up
[1891.10s -> 1894.54s]  and I had to get into the production truck and be like, okay, cause this is, this is like 25
[1894.54s -> 1899.35s]  minutes before the show, 30 minutes before the show. And I had to kick this guy out of the chair.
[1899.35s -> 1905.05s]  So if you're wondering why he's, he's got this ring is because it's like, I gotta get my mustache
[1905.05s -> 1911.53s]  done. I gotta get my mustache done and I've got to sit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. He's like, no,
[1911.53s -> 1916.97s]  no, no, I get it. I get it. So I sit down and I must look like such a weirdo. Like, so this guy's
[1916.97s -> 1922.82s]  about to get his face filled in with clown makeup and he has to move because this ego maniac wants
[1922.82s -> 1928.20s]  to make sure his mustache looks good filled in for the camera. This is not a requirement. This is.
[1928.76s -> 1937.43s]  This was not necessary. This was. So I kind of just was like, I need my, I gotta get my mustache
[1937.43s -> 1953.99s]  filled in. I have to get it filled in. Everyone's just like waiting their turn. It was disgusting
[1953.99s -> 1960.36s]  too. I looked so, yeah, look at how gross that is. It looks like there are wires coming out of my
[1961.42s -> 1968.57s]  over here. I can't grow a mustache. I really can't. Oh, by the way, this is when I was tweeting the
[1968.57s -> 1976.87s]  go live tweet. I forgot. I was like, oh shit, I've got a tweet. I've got a tweet right now.
[1976.87s -> 1983.16s]  So this is it. This is like 10 minutes before the show. I was like, crafting, crafting. Okay,
[1983.16s -> 1987.48s]  how do I say that? Okay, no, no, like we got, we got coffee. Okay, good. How does it look? Good.
[1987.48s -> 1994.47s]  Yeah, I'm not even paying attention to anything that's going on. I'm sunburned. I'm not sunburned.
[1994.47s -> 2004.86s]  I have a stupid filter on. I'm turning it off. There. I don't know why that was even on in the
[2004.86s -> 2012.71s]  first place. It looked stupid. The stilt walkers were amazing. You're in, you're on, you're browsing
[2012.71s -> 2033.69s]  your iPad, kid. You're playing an iPad game. This shirt. I'm not sunburned. This was great,
[2033.69s -> 2039.69s]  too. The funny part is, oh, hold on, I'll go back. So he was just kind of chilling in the outfield
[2039.69s -> 2050.52s]  for a long time. When we would come back to, there are tons of clips of him just standing
[2050.52s -> 2056.95s]  menacingly kind of over the fence in right field. He kind of hung out there for a couple of innings.
[2056.95s -> 2061.54s]  He was there for like two innings. So that you'd see like a ball would go over there or like in
[2061.54s -> 2065.32s]  the beginning of the show, he's just kind of in the right field is hanging out, just kind of
[2065.32s -> 2070.87s]  standing around, like looking around. He was awesome. The stilt walkers were fantastic.
[2070.87s -> 2083.72s]  I love these mascot outfits, too. They're so, and the names of the mascots, I, okay, people are
[2083.72s -> 2090.49s]  wondering, oh, what were the names of the mascots? I never told the broadcasters what the names of
[2090.49s -> 2097.61s]  the mascots were. So they actually had names. Their names were, it was supposed to be Presto
[2097.61s -> 2103.40s]  Magesto was the magician, but they called him Dumbledore and it just made it, it was just better.
[2103.40s -> 2111.34s]  They kept calling him Dumbledore. I just never told them their names. I just kind of forgot to.
[2111.34s -> 2117.40s]  It's just one of the things that just fell out. Yeah, it was Presto Magesto, Presto Magesto and
[2117.40s -> 2129.78s]  Kooky the Clown. I have, what were they calling the clown? It's Dumbledore. What would they call,
[2129.78s -> 2135.32s]  what were they saying the clown's name was? Maybe they didn't. They would just say the clown. They
[2135.32s -> 2152.22s]  called him the clown. He was great, too, the ball boy. They called, they were called the clown,
[2152.22s -> 2162.44s]  yeah. So another thing that is important for you guys to understand, the reason why we had so many
[2162.44s -> 2169.35s]  balls come out and in, don't tell anybody. Don't want, this is a secret. So obviously we had some
[2169.35s -> 2176.55s]  dangerous shit that we were doing and when you have three pitchers on the mound and a guy with
[2176.55s -> 2182.97s]  like three bats in his hand or somebody that can't see out of a mascot costume pitching to people,
[2184.76s -> 2192.87s]  you got to be careful and we, what we did was we used real baseballs and tea balls,
[2192.87s -> 2197.88s]  like little league tea balls. So anytime somebody was going to get thrown at or anytime there was
[2197.88s -> 2203.08s]  going to be, okay, we got, there's a guy in a, in a mascot costume. He might take a baseball to the
[2203.08s -> 2208.46s]  fucking face. He might take a baseball to like anywhere because they were, they were not protected.
[2208.46s -> 2212.86s]  The people in the mascot outfits were not wearing fin guards and cups and they were,
[2212.86s -> 2218.76s]  they were in mascot outfits. So we were using tea balls and it's a good thing we were because
[2218.76s -> 2223.64s]  people were just kind of sliding around, throwing them at each other, hitting each other with them
[2223.64s -> 2230.34s]  and stuff. So we, we had tea balls. When we were doing the actual baseball routines, just we were
[2230.34s -> 2235.40s]  playing the game, we were using the real balls. So yeah, come on, you know, you don't think I was
[2235.40s -> 2245.86s]  thinking of this? You don't think I thought of that? What's a tea ball? A tea ball is designed,
[2245.86s -> 2252.26s]  it's a softer baseball and it's designed for little kids to put on a tee. So there's no
[2252.26s -> 2256.50s]  pitching in tea ball. It sits on a tee. It's like a stand that stands up and you put the ball on it
[2256.50s -> 2264.47s]  and the kids just whack it, right? So these things are very soft because kids are not very smart and
[2264.47s -> 2270.15s]  they're not very coordinated. So a tee ball getting like hit in the chest or something from some kid
[2270.23s -> 2278.95s]  is not a baseball and it would be, you know, obviously less potential harm. Safety, Andy.
[2278.95s -> 2286.33s]  Yeah, yeah. Look, there's not a scenario where I'm going to have the mascot pitch a real baseball
[2286.33s -> 2294.81s]  to one of these, these high level athletes that hit a line drive directly into the mascot's balls
[2294.81s -> 2306.07s]  and send the person to the hospital. That's not going to happen. So that is not happening. We did
[2306.07s -> 2311.74s]  have an EMT there though, just in case anything weird happened, which there was plenty of
[2311.74s -> 2322.73s]  opportunity considering, you know, the amount of weird shit that people were doing. There's a couple
[2322.73s -> 2332.28s]  of great shots of whatever, Preston Magesto just standing there menacingly staring at the other
[2332.28s -> 2340.97s]  bench. There's a bunch of footage of the great video of the clown and the magician just both
[2340.97s -> 2350.94s]  like kind of staring at each other from across the bench. They were into it too. They went all out.
[2350.94s -> 2359.37s]  Oof, another F. Don't yell at me. It's not my fault. There's nothing I'm doing. I'm just sitting
[2359.37s -> 2373.50s]  here streaming. Oh, what a great call by Albertson. Paul Fondler is here. Paul Fondler is here and they
[2373.50s -> 2379.06s]  are no longer banned from the channel. But if they're here, just be aware. You will get banned
[2379.06s -> 2386.34s]  again if you say anything. Holy shit, Jesus. You will get banned again if you don't follow the rules.
[2386.34s -> 2401.46s]  These are great photos. And everyone's saying, why were you accentuating your ass so much?
[2401.54s -> 2410.17s]  I wasn't. This is what you're supposed to do as an umpire. I trained to be an umpire. I watched
[2410.17s -> 2416.18s]  videos. I watched... Paul Fondler wants me to play Skyrim. Oh, that's at least a fucking 30 minute
[2416.18s -> 2428.02s]  ban. Ban him again. No, ban him for 30 minutes. That's what a dumb thing to say. Okay, but anyways,
[2428.02s -> 2435.86s]  so as an umpire, you need to be able to see the whole strike zone and you need to keep your chin
[2436.42s -> 2442.74s]  level with the catcher's head with your right knee in, it's called getting into the spot,
[2442.74s -> 2451.45s]  into the sort of back of the catcher, leaning in, head up, chin up, level. That's what I was doing.
[2451.45s -> 2455.77s]  So I'm not like arching my back to be like, oh yeah, I'm like, look at my ass. No, I'm doing,
[2455.77s -> 2468.71s]  this is what umpire stance. You were definitely drunk. You don't know anything. I don't even know
[2468.71s -> 2482.12s]  who this is for. I think somebody at first base. Yeah, that's somebody at first base. I think,
[2482.12s -> 2489.64s]  okay, the empty seats make this funnier to me because this is nobody here. Like, wow,
[2489.64s -> 2495.24s]  the German baseball association. I've got this entire league of baseball and there's obviously
[2495.24s -> 2500.44s]  people have to be paid to be here and play and there's a whole operation and no one's here.
[2502.71s -> 2509.29s]  Nobody gives a shit about this. It's like part of it for me, especially when we, there was only
[2509.29s -> 2514.57s]  friends and family that were allowed, which is why you start to see some of the just, you know, the
[2514.73s -> 2522.50s]  hold on, we got an action shot here. Yeah. Having like the 10 people back here in the audience is
[2522.50s -> 2535.35s]  just like, wow, nobody really cares. The JBA is a money laundering scheme. That's so funny.
[2535.35s -> 2541.38s]  The power cards are something too. So, so the power cards were not going to be in the show
[2543.24s -> 2548.04s]  because remember a year or two ago, I wanted to do this and I said that we had some more time.
[2548.04s -> 2554.38s]  So I got to add more stuff. So in the course from like 2021 to 2022, I was like, how do I make this
[2554.38s -> 2561.61s]  like weirder? And it was, oh, you could, the coaches have decks of different rarities. You know,
[2562.33s -> 2566.97s]  it's, it's almost implied that, that these guys had to fucking buy a bunch of card packs and
[2566.97s -> 2573.26s]  Hearthstone to get these, right? Like you, you had to, you had to spend like thousands of dollars in
[2573.26s -> 2579.02s]  card packs and they get these decks and they can make them. That was kind of what the implication
[2579.02s -> 2585.34s]  was. So they, you know, playing the legendary card of, oh, the baby is supposed to be, oh, wow,
[2585.34s -> 2592.41s]  that's, that's hard to get. Like all the coaches don't have that. And it's just like a pay to win.
[2594.81s -> 2599.83s]  Well, you got to have a good deck of gold and legendary. Yeah. I think there's,
[2599.83s -> 2606.36s]  there's a great space. Look, I don't, I'm not a baseball person. Really. I love the game. I've
[2606.36s -> 2611.50s]  loved it since I was a kid, but I think that that adds a huge amount of value to the game.
[2611.50s -> 2616.94s]  I think that having decks, you have like a pool of cards. Let's say there's like 50 cards that
[2616.94s -> 2622.57s]  each coach can choose from before the game. I think that's, that would add a lot of value.
[2622.57s -> 2630.28s]  That would add comedy value. Yeah. Wouldn't mean, I don't know. It would be fun. Were there any
[2630.28s -> 2636.97s]  unused power cards? There might've been. Let me look at the list. The list I have because they're,
[2636.97s -> 2641.82s]  yeah, let me see which ones didn't get played. It's so funny when the run through the bases
[2641.82s -> 2649.99s]  backwards got played and only one person did it. So the other person had to get like called out.
[2649.99s -> 2661.32s]  Oh, let me see. What, which, which ones maybe didn't get shown. I have a list here. Okay. So
[2661.32s -> 2666.68s]  five strikes. They used it on me. I was allowed five strikes. Uh, picture must use a beach ball
[2666.68s -> 2670.31s]  for the next at bat. I knew that was going to be messed up. I knew that was never going to work.
[2670.31s -> 2675.27s]  Uh, I did that just purely because I wanted to see what would happen. So that, that, I knew that
[2675.27s -> 2681.54s]  there was, that was impossible. Like it's literally not fucking possible. So what happens? Uh, other
[2681.54s -> 2686.17s]  coach must wear a bag on their head for the rest of the inning. We did that one. All runners must
[2686.17s -> 2690.82s]  run backwards through the bases. We did that one. Opposing teams mascot must pitch for the rest of
[2690.82s -> 2697.59s]  the inning. All runs are worth three runs. We did that. I don't think we did this one for the next
[2697.59s -> 2704.31s]  bat or the pitcher must pitch from 15 extra feet away from the plate. I don't think that one came
[2704.31s -> 2714.12s]  out. Did it? That's overpowered. No, that definitely didn't come up. Calling two more pitchers for this
[2714.12s -> 2718.52s]  at bat. That one came out. All opposing outfielders are removed for the next at bat. That one was a
[2718.52s -> 2725.30s]  big one. But, so what I'm thinking, right, is, Rukase, think about that. If you have this deck
[2725.30s -> 2728.26s]  of six cards, you can only play them once. You can't play them for the rest. You can only play
[2728.26s -> 2733.77s]  them one time and it is for whatever it says on the card. Can you imagine if you had bases loaded
[2733.77s -> 2738.57s]  and you didn't play your power cards until like the seventh inning and you remove all the
[2738.57s -> 2747.14s]  outfielders and all runs are worth three runs? That would be a big deal, right? So,
[2749.32s -> 2753.64s]  giving the cards to the coaches, we told the players, because all the players obviously know
[2753.64s -> 2758.28s]  the baseball much more than the coaches did. Except, I think one of the coaches knew a lot
[2758.28s -> 2763.66s]  about the game, but these guys live and breathe baseball. Some of them are pro players. So,
[2763.66s -> 2768.09s]  it was like, look, help the coaches, right? If you think there's a good situation, no, no, no.
[2768.09s -> 2771.29s]  Bring out the beach ball. Bring out the beach ball. Let's fuck them up. You know,
[2771.29s -> 2776.25s]  bring out the three pitchers and we'll get a walk. It was kind of up to them to figure that out.
[2776.25s -> 2781.16s]  None of these were scripted at all. They weren't. It was just whenever you want to use them,
[2781.16s -> 2786.57s]  whatever you feel like using them. It just had to happen before and at bat and you had to just tell
[2786.57s -> 2791.29s]  me. So, we could obviously tell, you know, I could relate to the truck and the truck could put the
[2791.29s -> 2799.46s]  graphic on the screen so you guys could see it. Are we going to get a power card tier list? I feel
[2799.46s -> 2807.40s]  like there's some really fun things you could do with a power card system in any sport. Because,
[2807.40s -> 2814.23s]  I don't know, I always thought that as I got older, I would enjoy sports more, right? Okay,
[2814.23s -> 2819.53s]  I'm in my 40s. Let's put on the game. Let's put the big game on, right? I kind of just don't care.
[2821.19s -> 2824.97s]  But if there was more stuff like this, and I know there is, for those that don't know,
[2824.97s -> 2831.45s]  have you ever heard of the Savannah Bananas? They do fun stuff like this. There's a whole league
[2831.45s -> 2835.75s]  and I would love to see more stuff like that. I would like to see it get more popular.
[2837.21s -> 2841.64s]  Bro, you're 37. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But I always thought that I would want to be like,
[2841.64s -> 2847.30s]  oh yeah, you know, I don't know, get that cartoon shit out of here. I want traditional baseball and
[2847.30s -> 2851.99s]  I want traditional umpires. But the more that I think about it, I would have more fun. I would
[2851.99s -> 2859.40s]  have way more fun if there were power cards in baseball or in the NFL or in hockey. I feel like
[2859.40s -> 2872.81s]  it would change everything for me and I'd actually care about it again. ESPN was actually showing a
[2872.81s -> 2879.32s]  Savannah Bananas game on the same night. Really? That's so funny. Are you kidding me? Yeah,
[2879.40s -> 2886.82s]  cartoon baseball. Take it over. Take it over. You heard it here. Cartoon fucking fun baseball's
[2886.82s -> 2895.74s]  coming. We're coming. You were watching both at the same time? That's so fucking funny. No,
[2895.74s -> 2901.58s]  they're doing a lot of cool shit over there. They really are. I will definitely say that
[2902.68s -> 2910.73s]  changing the rules of the game would bring me kind of back to the game. When was the last time you
[2910.73s -> 2920.25s]  watched a full NFL game? It's been a long time. It's been a very long time. But can you imagine
[2920.25s -> 2925.99s]  sitting there like at a bar? I'm sitting, I'm thinking of like in a bar, fucking Boston,
[2926.47s -> 2932.58s]  like a Boston fucking bar. And all of a sudden, you know that your team that you're rooting for
[2932.58s -> 2938.10s]  has not used this power card yet and you're waiting. Come on, coach. Pull the fucking
[2938.10s -> 2942.10s]  understudy. Pull the understudy already. And all of a sudden, here comes the understudy.
[2942.10s -> 2953.21s]  Coaches would be ridiculed on when they used the cartoon power up. Oh my God. Yeah, John Stevenson
[2953.21s -> 2958.33s]  is a fucking idiot. Can you believe that he played the understudy card in the fucking first
[2958.33s -> 2962.54s]  inning? They could have used that at the top of the eighth. Literally worse, coach. I hope they
[2962.54s -> 2970.49s]  replace him next season. It would be, it would, it would add another meta to the game. And like the
[2970.49s -> 2980.58s]  bar goes crazy when this comes up because they know that they got to be on defense. Very upset at
[2980.58s -> 2992.12s]  something. I'm so glad that the pie, they actually got the pie being filmed because I, all right.
[2992.12s -> 2997.30s]  So there were two gags that I wanted to do in this kind of inning where I knew I was going to have
[2997.30s -> 3002.20s]  to, I was going to, I, this was not, I didn't know when this was going to happen, but I knew we were
[3002.28s -> 3008.18s]  going to do it. I knew I was going to get pieed in the face. I wanted someone in the audience to
[3008.18s -> 3013.69s]  throw a full large soda, a full fountain drink and hit me directly in the forehead. And we thought
[3013.69s -> 3018.49s]  about it. We were like, how do we make that, how do we make that work? Right? Because this net was
[3018.49s -> 3025.02s]  here, but I wanted someone to stand up and I wanted them to like full on throw a full fountain soda.
[3025.02s -> 3028.94s]  And I wanted it to hit me right in the fucking mouth. I wanted it to hit me like explode in my face
[3028.94s -> 3034.70s]  and like, boom. And it would be unbearably awful to look at. I wanted to get hit directly in the
[3034.70s -> 3046.58s]  face. But there was no way we could do it without it. Why? Commitment, commitment. Do you guys know
[3047.45s -> 3056.58s]  that when me and Ster did the, he broke into my house and we argued over the money,
[3056.58s -> 3061.30s]  there was going to be a routine where we were like talking and hanging out and being like,
[3061.30s -> 3066.23s]  oh yeah, I know. Okay. Whatever, man. Like, fuck you. We were going to have another routine where
[3066.23s -> 3077.42s]  I got up, I got us sodas and he was going to do a huge loogie while I got up into my soda and I was
[3077.42s -> 3091.29s]  going to drink it. I was going to drink it. So I'll do it. If I think it was going to be funny
[3091.29s -> 3099.37s]  enough, I would have done it. You guys are fucked. No. Well, I mean, this is, I, we were just
[3099.37s -> 3103.53s]  sitting there thinking like, wouldn't that be funny if you like did like a huge, like, oh yeah, man.
[3103.53s -> 3107.37s]  Yeah, yeah. No, dude. Completely water under the bridge. It's fine. Oh yeah, dude. Thanks for the
[3107.37s -> 3115.14s]  coke. Oh yeah. I'll be right back. He's just like, boom. And I fucking just, oh man, I love soda and
[3115.14s -> 3127.53s]  just like fucking chuck the whole thing. So yes, I wanted to take a full fountain soda to the face
[3127.53s -> 3133.02s]  and have it hit me in the face and have it hurt. Not that much, but like, you know, whatever.
[3133.02s -> 3138.41s]  So let me explain. I didn't want it to hurt. I want it, like, you know, I wanted it to be,
[3138.41s -> 3149.48s]  but I don't know. I just, I don't know. How can I describe this? Pre-pandemic Andy. Yeah. I mean,
[3149.48s -> 3156.97s]  come on, man. I want it to hurt. I don't look, okay. I don't want it to hurt. I want it to look
[3156.97s -> 3163.53s]  like it did. You're a masochist. No, I'm not. I just, I look, if somebody threw a soda at me at a
[3163.53s -> 3168.68s]  game, what would it look like? If I got pied in the face, what would it look like? It wouldn't be
[3168.68s -> 3174.62s]  like, oops, oh, here it comes. Oh, don't, no, wait, hold on. I'm not ready. No, that's not what would
[3174.62s -> 3182.44s]  happen. If I got pied in the face, I'm getting pied in the face directly in the fucking face.
[3182.44s -> 3195.26s]  That's how it would happen if it were to happen. So the, the funny thing to tell you about this
[3195.26s -> 3201.00s]  was I was arguing with the coach and there was a play going on in the field. I was arguing with
[3201.00s -> 3207.96s]  the coach and he came over and full on did it directly into my face, right into my, my,
[3207.96s -> 3211.98s]  where my eyes are. And I just, I was arguing with, I didn't, I knew it was probably coming,
[3211.98s -> 3216.34s]  but I was arguing with the coach. So I took it full blast, just full on in the face and
[3216.90s -> 3226.47s]  it's shaving cream and it started to burn my eyes and it blew out the microphone. So
[3227.03s -> 3233.91s]  doing the manscaped ad, the microphone was destroyed here. Yeah. The microphone was destroyed
[3233.91s -> 3245.74s]  from the shaving cream and right now my eyes are burning. They're on fire. So doing the manscaped
[3245.74s -> 3254.23s]  read turned out to be quite a disaster in regards to how I felt in between this inning and the next
[3254.31s -> 3260.78s]  one. I was dumping water in my eyes and it was okay after a little while. Shaving cream
[3260.78s -> 3270.49s]  thankfully is not that harsh after a while. But yeah, hold on, go back. Yeah. I think it added
[3270.49s -> 3277.50s]  to it. I think it was funnier that the, the microphone got destroyed. You could have had a
[3277.50s -> 3283.22s]  clown do the flower squirt gag. Yeah. Or I mean, I could have taken a full pie to the face. It
[3283.22s -> 3288.54s]  happened again at the end of the show too. It might've been the same, the same actor just kind
[3288.54s -> 3292.87s]  of looking for me. You know what I mean? But I did take a second one in the face at the end,
[3292.87s -> 3301.69s]  during the fight. You had cue cards? Yeah, I had cue cards. I wanted to make sure I got it right
[3301.69s -> 3309.70s]  because they were a big supporter of the stream. And look, like Bansley, Manscaped, Surfshark,
[3309.70s -> 3315.83s]  they were, I've told you guys this before a thousand times. And I will say it again,
[3315.83s -> 3319.58s]  shows like this are really expensive. They take a lot of time. They take a lot of prep,
[3319.58s -> 3326.28s]  but they take a lot of money. And if there are, if there are companies that are into the idea
[3326.28s -> 3330.36s]  and they think it's really fun and they want it to be a good show, that's what they want.
[3332.68s -> 3338.44s]  If it makes sense to do like a thing that integrates it into the stream, that's better
[3338.44s -> 3344.39s]  for me. That's where you'll see those integrations. And there were, we were talking to a lot of
[3344.39s -> 3352.66s]  companies and it's like, okay, who can I actually have like fun with? I want it to be a fun thing.
[3352.66s -> 3356.38s]  I don't want it to be a thing that people are annoyed with. And I think we did a pretty good
[3356.38s -> 3370.78s]  job with it. Yeah, I'm sorry about the Fs. I can't do anything about it. Real Baseball is sponsored
[3370.78s -> 3376.76s]  to hell and back anyways. Yeah. It feels like more authentic that way. Obviously the show is
[3376.76s -> 3387.86s]  expensive. So that helps. But yeah, I, anytime that you see a sponsor on this stream, it's a sponsor
[3387.86s -> 3392.10s]  that I know that I've been able to go kind of back and forth with and understand. And for me to be
[3392.10s -> 3398.07s]  like, I want the show to be the show. I want to be able to do something integrated in a fun way.
[3398.07s -> 3403.13s]  And that's what I want to do. And the companies that want to play ball like that, no pun intended,
[3403.13s -> 3406.92s]  those are the people that I want to work with. And that's who I will continue to work with, right?
[3406.92s -> 3421.05s]  Stop leaning and sit straight. Me and my mom? Well, cause I'm reading chat. I'm reading chat over here.
[3421.05s -> 3431.72s]  Get a cigarette sponsorship. Stop talking about cigarettes. You weird person. Stop talking about
[3431.72s -> 3437.13s]  me smoking cigarettes. There's, okay, there's like a, there's a group of people in this community
[3437.13s -> 3442.30s]  that like are cigarette Andes and they think it's like wicked funny. They're like, oh, hey dude,
[3442.30s -> 3445.74s]  like say, like, you know, type, type like, hey, you should smoke a pack of cigarettes on screen
[3445.74s -> 3452.04s]  today. They're like this, they're like the cigarette comedians. There's a group of cigarette
[3452.04s -> 3459.30s]  comedians that are in this community. I mean, it's, I guess a kind of funny, but no, I would
[3459.30s -> 3467.50s]  never have a cigarette sponsor. I don't smoke cigarettes. And I don't, I don't like, you know
[3467.50s -> 3476.58s]  what? Who fucking knows? Right? Okay. On the next one, who knows? But I will tell you that yes,
[3476.58s -> 3483.66s]  there is a next one. And the next one is going to be fucking crazy. And I'm going to spoil it right
[3483.74s -> 3490.79s]  now. I'm going to spoil the next show right now. You ready? Baseball's over. Baseball's over. I can
[3490.79s -> 3497.78s]  talk about this now. I'm going to spoil this. It's time for you to get fucking spoiled. I'm just
[3497.78s -> 3512.33s]  kidding. It keeps freezing. Yeah. It's the stupid server that I'm streaming. I swallowed it. I'm
[3512.33s -> 3521.51s]  fine. But anyways, the next one is coming. The next one is going to be at the same scale as this.
[3521.51s -> 3532.81s]  It's probably bigger than this. I just like, I don't know. It is not wrestling, but I will tell
[3532.81s -> 3539.82s]  you it is. Okay. Here's a spoiler. You want your spoiler? Fine. It's not going to be three years
[3539.82s -> 3546.84s]  from now. I'm hopeful that this can be a thing we're doing by the end of the year or earlier,
[3546.84s -> 3555.77s]  depending. I will tell you who it is. I'll tell you who is involved. There's going to be a stream
[3555.77s -> 3565.74s]  on this channel in the next so on months, whenever it is, starring somebody who's become a pretty
[3565.74s -> 3570.70s]  good friend of mine. Although I'm not really a friend. I would say more of an acquaintance.
[3570.70s -> 3579.64s]  You all know him as Mr. Breenz. He's working on something. He wants some of my help promoting it
[3579.64s -> 3587.99s]  and shouting it out, I guess. I don't want to give too many details away, but I've been contacted by
[3587.99s -> 3595.46s]  Mr. Breenz to help with promoting something. I haven't decided if I'm going to do it. I haven't
[3595.46s -> 3606.57s]  decided yet. But this will be, according to what Mr. Breenz has told me, this is going to be a
[3606.57s -> 3613.45s]  fucking huge show. Huge. So that's all I'm going to tell you. It's the only thing you will know
[3613.45s -> 3617.29s]  until it becomes a reality that I can actually really start to talk about. But
[3618.55s -> 3635.48s]  were there more technical problems than you expected? Oh yeah. Because we, because remember
[3635.48s -> 3644.73s]  the pre-recorded segments from that sports, like the crunch time, that show at the end, we did all
[3644.73s -> 3651.18s]  that before this stream. Everything was clean. There was no video problems. There was no video
[3651.18s -> 3657.90s]  processing problems. There was no encoding problems. And the stream started the first three to
[3657.90s -> 3663.38s]  four straight innings. It was about an hour and a half. It was perfect. There was not a single
[3663.38s -> 3670.98s]  problem. It just all of a sudden, in the fourth and fifth inning, it just kind of started to go
[3671.54s -> 3680.63s]  haywire. And they had no idea why it was happening. And they tried different video processors. The
[3680.63s -> 3686.31s]  stream came down like two or three different times to try different video stuff and encoding stuff.
[3686.31s -> 3692.71s]  I think they just switched ingest servers and it was fine after that. Which is, I don't know. We
[3692.71s -> 3699.90s]  have no idea. So it was weird how it was fine for the first three innings and then fine for the last
[3699.90s -> 3711.30s]  five innings. It was just weird. We don't really know. How did the Roadrunner joke happen? Well,
[3713.02s -> 3720.39s]  the magic of television. I won't tell you that one. When are you going to do the auto-treat
[3720.39s -> 3731.56s]  review stream? Where's Bugleberry? Where's Bugleberry? Bugleberry has... I've been talking
[3731.56s -> 3737.91s]  to Bugleberry. You might hear from Bugleberry at some point soon. Oh, also, I want to bring this up.
[3737.91s -> 3747.10s]  I tweeted about it. But the merch for the show went so unbelievably quickly. We did not expect
[3747.10s -> 3755.48s]  it to go that fast. So all the souvenir balls and some other game used stuff, we kind of replenished
[3755.48s -> 3762.57s]  the store. So the souvenir balls went so quickly. It was just like, oh, should we just do more of
[3762.57s -> 3769.30s]  these? So there are now, we replenished the store with some items. There are new, you can buy a
[3769.30s -> 3776.02s]  signed ball. Not, I think there's a limited supply of the in the stream stuff that was used in the
[3776.02s -> 3781.37s]  stream. But we're replenishing the souvenir balls that I'll sign. Because I, I don't know,
[3782.17s -> 3787.35s]  if you have like limited quantity of stuff like that, I want people that wanted one to be able
[3787.35s -> 3797.58s]  to get one. And so we're just going to put it back up. So that's German985.com. Store is there. Go
[3797.58s -> 3804.68s]  take a look at what's available again. And you're saying it. We had the, we had the sign in the
[3804.68s -> 3811.27s]  outfield. So let's talk about it. Grotto Beasts. You know, the sign's in the outfield. Oh, this is
[3811.27s -> 3822.04s]  a great, this is a great picture. The sign was in the outfield here and it's coming along. I will
[3822.04s -> 3834.86s]  reliably tell you we, okay, just want to make sure I didn't puke. We are, I want to say, maybe two to
[3834.86s -> 3846.28s]  three months away from taking pre-orders. It is imminent. There's been a lot of play testing,
[3846.28s -> 3858.20s]  apparently very fun. It's a full game. It's got a lot of cards. And we're very hopeful that I can
[3858.20s -> 3867.00s]  finally tell you that somewhere into holiday of this year is when you will actually be able to
[3867.00s -> 3881.02s]  purchase this and own it. Physical cards, yes. Physical cards. There are a lot of cards. And as
[3881.02s -> 3887.86s]  we get closer, we'll start to talk about that more. But I really want it to be kind of a holiday
[3887.86s -> 3902.55s]  this year. So we're, it's, it's, it's coming along. Does it come in a loot crate? No. You buy the,
[3902.55s -> 3911.27s]  what are you talking about, loot crate? They're physical NFTs. It's a fucking card, man. It's,
[3911.27s -> 3924.60s]  no, you stop saying that. Physical NFT. Oh yeah, this part's so funny. Okay, so we asked if they
[3924.60s -> 3929.59s]  could smoke. Like, oh yeah, is it okay to have like a cigarette? Like, is the, you know, the,
[3929.59s -> 3934.74s]  the circus, you know, I got, I, my, my guys sitting there, they're smoking. We, we were going to do
[3935.30s -> 3940.74s]  a routine where everyone on the bench on the circus team had a cigarette in their mouth and
[3940.74s -> 3949.29s]  they were all smoking. But it turns out that was not going to fly. So we, we were allowed to have
[3949.29s -> 3957.43s]  like one, but every single person, we wanted a shot of like 20 people in the dugout, just all
[3957.43s -> 3963.78s]  having a cigarette in their mouth. But we also wanted to respect the field, too. And that's,
[3965.13s -> 3971.13s]  I don't want to, you know, disrespect somebody else's space. If it's like, no, that's not fucking
[3971.13s -> 3980.31s]  okay. Then like, okay. Forcing actors to smoke. No, no, no, no, no. It was like if they did smoke.
[3980.31s -> 3984.98s]  I don't know how many people smoked. They could have had a fake one, right? It would have been fake.
[3984.98s -> 3998.66s]  What a cigarette comedian that would be. All right. All right, you got me. No, you got me. No,
[3998.66s -> 4005.98s]  that's, that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a hypocrite. That's, that's fair.
[4005.98s -> 4012.73s]  All the cigarette comedians. The community of like 40 cigarette comedians in this community.
[4012.73s -> 4020.90s]  Yeah, that's fair. I'll take it. I'll take the loss on that one. Unban that person. They're banned
[4020.90s -> 4038.97s]  for five seconds. What is, what is going on here? Am I about to get slapped? Did I get slapped in
[4038.97s -> 4051.83s]  the face? I don't think so. Oh no, right. This is when the mascots started fighting each other for
[4051.83s -> 4072.15s]  the first time. The mascots, I don't know anything. This is so perfect. I wonder if he go,
[4072.15s -> 4079.51s]  I wonder if he went through more than one cigarette. Who designed the mascots? Those were just,
[4079.51s -> 4088.06s]  we just bought them from a mascot wholesaler or retailer. Took a while to find the right ones,
[4088.06s -> 4101.75s]  but we just bought them. The mascots having, dude, the part where the mascots are in the back fighting
[4102.42s -> 4108.34s]  with the trash can and the trash. He's like smashing them like down here with the trash can.
[4108.34s -> 4119.83s]  I remember seeing that and going, oh fuck. I don't want to give too much away, but I, yes,
[4119.83s -> 4131.10s]  that was, whatever. It was, he would snap his neck. Ugh. Mother horns. They were people,
[4131.10s -> 4138.71s]  they were actually people in the audience that had like a clown noisemaker and it was distracting.
[4138.71s -> 4144.09s]  It was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. They did it after every other pitch. It was distracting.
[4144.09s -> 4163.59s]  It really was like the video processing. So this is what it looked like up here. This was a,
[4164.23s -> 4171.69s]  this was like the video zone. They were, they were the production truck, which is why it was so weird
[4171.69s -> 4176.84s]  when the videos started having problems. Cause like, this is all broadcast equipment. This is,
[4176.84s -> 4187.26s]  this is all, these guys do this for a living. This is broadcast baseball level equipment.
[4187.26s -> 4193.14s]  So it was just so bizarre. It was just like, why is this happening? Why the fuck are we dropping
[4193.94s -> 4202.01s]  frames? And like I could tell you right now, why the fuck am I dropping frames right now?
[4202.01s -> 4220.04s]  Who were you rooting for? I was rooting for a good shell. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer.
[4220.04s -> 4232.28s]  Good answer. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer. True though. But I mean,
[4234.50s -> 4246.79s]  the circus though. I mean, it just, it's a circus. Unicycles, fire breathing. We got all these props
[4246.79s -> 4252.74s]  down here too. They had just so much random shit down here that they were just told. So we told
[4252.74s -> 4256.52s]  them, we were just like, oh yeah, just do whatever you want. You guys can do whatever you want. You
[4256.52s -> 4259.96s]  want to like throw stuff at me. You want to walk around and make balloon animals and shit. Please
[4259.96s -> 4264.52s]  do. And that's what they were just doing in the dugout. They were just having a grand old time.
[4264.52s -> 4276.17s]  They were having a grand old time. Favorite player. I can't tell you a favorite player.
[4276.17s -> 4287.06s]  So many of them were so funny and they were so good. Like how do you pick one of all these
[4287.06s -> 4298.58s]  great performers and great players? I don't, I can't. Xavier McMagic. Yeah. I mean, Schmidt
[4298.58s -> 4307.61s]  Poppo is up there too. Honk. Honk was up there too. Honk had the Inside the Park home run,
[4307.61s -> 4316.65s]  which was hilarious. Yeah. David Honk had it inside the park. I thought that was gone too.
[4316.65s -> 4325.82s]  It was so close. What about the security? The security guard was an actor. There's another actor.
[4325.82s -> 4334.17s]  He was awesome. Both the security guard and the streaker, they were both actors and they were great.
[4334.17s -> 4342.10s]  They were fantastic. They did their roles very well. Very believable. And yeah, here he is. He
[4342.10s -> 4348.97s]  was just, he was just walking around too. He was just walking around out kind of on the field with
[4348.97s -> 4364.63s]  his two-seater shirt on. Oh, there's Schmidt Poppo right there. Schmidt Poppo was, oh no,
[4364.63s -> 4374.06s]  it's going back on. How many people involved knew what your streams were beforehand? Um, there were
[4374.06s -> 4378.60s]  a few people that knew the channel, but we kept it really under wraps for a long time because
[4378.60s -> 4385.34s]  obviously we didn't want the location to leak prematurely. Because look, there's one thing about
[4385.42s -> 4393.64s]  having your location leak 10 minutes into the show and you have security versus the location is
[4393.64s -> 4399.37s]  leaked a month or two before the show and people know where it's going to be. There's a huge
[4399.37s -> 4406.01s]  difference. So that was obviously part of the reason why we kept it really kind of tight,
[4406.01s -> 4412.55s]  even to cast and crew. But a few days before the show and like obviously during the show and the
[4412.55s -> 4422.68s]  day before the show, people, people did know. How come the audio is not syncing? Uh, because I keep
[4422.68s -> 4431.45s]  dropping frames to the server. You couldn't place Missouri on a map by the way. I can. It's just not
[4431.45s -> 4439.58s]  under pressure. What was what you, what was the thing that you needed this particular location
[4439.58s -> 4444.55s]  for? Why you delayed it? Well, there were a couple of reasons why this show has changed a few times.
[4444.55s -> 4449.50s]  Here's, here's the kind of long and short of it. So back in 2020, when I wanted to do the show
[4449.50s -> 4458.30s]  originally, I mean, lockdown happened in March and we had, we, all these designs that you're seeing
[4458.30s -> 4464.90s]  here, a lot of them were, we did, there was a lot of pre-work that was already done. We were about
[4464.90s -> 4471.94s]  to print the jerseys before we said, no, we can't do it. So lockdown happened in March of 2020.
[4471.94s -> 4479.14s]  And then March, April, May, June, July, it was like July of 2020 when I wanted to do this show.
[4479.14s -> 4486.54s]  And that was back when they were saying that people, having more than 10 people in a room was,
[4486.54s -> 4491.82s]  was not allowed. It was like, you couldn't do it. It was like very, very ill-advised against,
[4491.82s -> 4496.30s]  there was no vaccines at that point. There was no treatment at that point.
[4496.30s -> 4503.21s]  So we were just like, am I really going to put like 60 people in the same area in the same room
[4503.21s -> 4511.30s]  three or four months after lockdown? No, testing was not even easy either. It wasn't like you could
[4511.30s -> 4520.90s]  go to CVS and go get 20 tests. No, it wasn't like that. So I just said, you know what, whatever,
[4520.90s -> 4524.84s]  cancel all the shows I really wanted to do and we'll just come back to this later.
[4524.84s -> 4534.14s]  And then in 2021, we had, we had a venue, we had a certain venue. We were at a different stadium
[4534.14s -> 4540.33s]  and we had to change it because there was something, I don't want to speak completely
[4540.33s -> 4546.12s]  wrong here, but there was a venue problem that we couldn't really, we had, we couldn't overlook it.
[4546.12s -> 4550.09s]  And it was like, you know what, it was right before baseball season was about to start,
[4550.09s -> 4556.57s]  kind of around the same, because here's the thing, getting baseball players, they play baseball in
[4556.57s -> 4562.25s]  the baseball season and trying to get a stadium like this or any of the other ones during the
[4562.25s -> 4568.46s]  season where everyone's playing is almost impossible because there's games here.
[4568.46s -> 4572.14s]  There's games here every day. There's games here every other day, right? In a lot of these
[4572.14s -> 4579.02s]  stadiums. So minor league, semi-pro leagues, you can't just be like, hey, I want clowns and
[4579.02s -> 4581.82s]  magicians to throw pies at each other. It's like, well, we have, we're in the middle of a fucking
[4581.82s -> 4590.98s]  season, man. You can't do that. Yeah. These are real players. These are real baseball players.
[4590.98s -> 4596.58s]  This year, when we finally got it off the ground, something that a lot of people might not realize
[4596.58s -> 4604.46s]  about a stadium is it's not really just baseball. There's a lot of work that goes into a stadium
[4604.46s -> 4612.34s]  on the field. And from my understanding, they will not, a lot of stadiums do not want you to
[4612.34s -> 4617.62s]  play ball on their field unless it is ready to play ball on. There's liability problems,
[4617.62s -> 4623.42s]  right? Like, hey, the mound was fucked up and one of my guys fell off the rubber and broke his ankle.
[4623.42s -> 4629.75s]  There's a lot of stuff that they can kind of cancel shows for and can can events for.
[4629.75s -> 4635.45s]  The stream has fallen apart. Yeah, dude, I don't want to fucking restart and go play
[4635.45s -> 4640.60s]  server hopping until I find one that works. But I have to ping somebody at Twitch about this.
[4640.60s -> 4646.79s]  It's kind of fucking ridiculous, if I'm honest. So I got to talk to somebody and be like, can you
[4646.79s -> 4655.53s]  just see where my traffic is going and find out why the fuck this is happening? But I mean, it's
[4655.53s -> 4664.76s]  fine, but I've dropped 10,000 frames streaming to a West Coast server. Do I really have to go to
[4666.22s -> 4678.02s]  Mexico to have my stream stay on without problems? Whatever. But yeah, a lot goes into
[4678.02s -> 4683.40s]  getting the ink dry on having this kind of location, which was a huge pain in the ass.
[4683.40s -> 4688.06s]  But thankfully, we finally got into agreement with CarShield and they were completely on board with
[4688.06s -> 4691.82s]  everything. So it was like, yes, finally we got the venue. The venue was the hardest thing to get.
[4691.82s -> 4704.95s]  And then the players. Two of the hardest things. Mexico Arc. Yeah, they have to make sure the dirt
[4704.95s -> 4711.53s]  is soft. They have to make it because it's there's liability problems with if the field is not ready
[4711.53s -> 4722.20s]  to be used so that you have to be. Obviously, it's a lot of work, a lot of time. Oh, look at how happy
[4722.20s -> 4733.82s]  he looks. Isn't this the banner to the Discord right now? The seventh inning stretch or I think
[4733.82s -> 4742.54s]  it was actually the eighth inning stretch. This guy. I love this guy. This face. He had this face
[4742.54s -> 4748.12s]  all night. It didn't change once. He came up to me with the balls and he had that face. He was in
[4748.12s -> 4762.01s]  character and he nailed it. They're so good. Is one of the qualifications to be able to ride a unicycle?
[4762.01s -> 4771.51s]  Well, that was the performance group. So that was a group. Were they real clowns? Yes. Well,
[4771.51s -> 4778.04s]  they were performers. They were a performance group based in St. Louis. Who came up with the
[4778.04s -> 4785.53s]  players' names? I wrote them all down four or five months ago. They're all, I just wrote them all
[4785.53s -> 4793.90s]  down. I sat there and just was like, I'm going to come up with names. How much was improv and how
[4793.90s -> 4802.22s]  much was scripted? So with an event like this, when you have a bunch of people, it's because it's not
[4802.22s -> 4808.18s]  just me doing something. And I saw a lot of people saying, man, you were just the umpire. I really
[4808.18s -> 4814.57s]  wish you were like a commentator or you did something else besides being the umpire. But I
[4814.57s -> 4823.32s]  didn't want to do that. I wanted to be this kind of umpire character of guy that didn't do that
[4823.32s -> 4828.46s]  stuff. I didn't want to read from a script in this show. I wanted it to be outrageous. I wanted to
[4828.54s -> 4835.06s]  get pied in the face and shit and not know when. So before the show even happened, and what I do
[4835.06s -> 4842.18s]  with pretty much any of these things that you ever see, is I write like three pages or four pages
[4842.74s -> 4847.59s]  just of stuff. I want to see this. I want it to be like this. I want their names to be this. I want
[4847.59s -> 4853.21s]  it to look like this. I want, this is what I, inning by inning, I kind of gave like what I was
[4853.21s -> 4860.76s]  looking for. And I would say like, obviously the Road Runner bit was something we planned to do.
[4860.76s -> 4864.78s]  That's something I wanted to see. The Streaker thing was planned. It was that we want the
[4864.78s -> 4867.74s]  Streaker to come out in the seventh inning. That was going to happen. That was planned.
[4867.74s -> 4872.57s]  But when they got out, when they got out, when the Streaker took his shirt off and came to the
[4872.57s -> 4880.02s]  field, they were, they were directed to just do whatever they wanted. It was an improv show. It
[4880.02s -> 4884.95s]  was up to them. And obviously I gave them guidelines of here's what I would like to see you do. Here's
[4884.95s -> 4890.60s]  what I don't want to see you really do. But everybody here was just like, hey, let's go do
[4890.60s -> 4894.49s]  this. That would be fun. Hey, let's go do this. That would be fun. Hey, you know what? I'm going
[4894.49s -> 4904.17s]  to get on the unicycle this inning. So if a ball gets hit to me, good luck. What does the
[4904.17s -> 4910.12s]  banner behind me say? Something, something bugging you. Should I add for something?
[4910.12s -> 4927.11s]  What did you not want the Streaker to do? Take his underwear off. Got it. The casters were legit as
[4927.11s -> 4937.19s]  well. Yeah, I think the number one thing that kind of reiterated to this actor was, hey yeah,
[4937.19s -> 4940.90s]  just make sure those underwear, those pants don't come off. Just make sure that doesn't come off.
[4940.90s -> 4943.70s]  Like this, just don't, just make sure your underwear doesn't come off. Keep your underwear on.
[4943.70s -> 4951.21s]  Keep this on. Don't take this off. Do not take that off for any reason. Because I would be
[4951.29s -> 4964.74s]  taking a pretty long vacation from streaming, I think, if that were the case. Did you practice
[4964.74s -> 4971.29s]  plate umpiring? No, I watched a lot of videos and I, we spent the previous day, I was kind of going
[4971.29s -> 4976.55s]  over, I was behind the plate, obviously, when we filmed a lot of the other scenes. So I had a lot
[4976.55s -> 4987.08s]  of time to figure out how to do it. This was planned too. Like I want, okay, so one of the
[4987.08s -> 4991.29s]  things that I want to do is I wanted to throw too many people out, so I had to play in the game.
[4991.29s -> 4996.09s]  One thing that I didn't get to do that I really wanted to do, so the joke was I was going to throw
[4996.09s -> 5000.73s]  out too many people on the circus side, so then I would have to play in the game. And I wanted to
[5000.73s -> 5009.45s]  go into center field and still call balls and strikes from center field. You were a trash umpire.
[5009.45s -> 5015.34s]  Okay, I got the whole field to look at here. I wanted to be in center field and be like,
[5022.71s -> 5032.81s]  but it just turned out we, they, they, we just didn't do it. Did you know that the player,
[5032.81s -> 5035.77s]  that player was stealing balls from you? No, I didn't. I didn't feel that at all.
[5035.77s -> 5043.08s]  Because remember, I have this big umpire turtle armor suit on. So like, I have a bunch of shit
[5043.08s -> 5052.89s]  here. I had two like mic packs. I had this in-ear like secret service ear. I had this microphone
[5052.89s -> 5056.65s]  that was here and they were all packed here. So I, they had so much shit all over me. I couldn't
[5056.65s -> 5061.74s]  tell. He stole a ball from me and then he tagged me out with it and that's what, and then I figured
[5061.74s -> 5064.86s]  it out. I was like, you got these two balls out here. That's not the right ball. I was safe.
[5064.86s -> 5071.86s]  I actually was safe. That whole event was unironically the best thing I've ever seen on
[5071.86s -> 5079.94s]  Twitch. I'm really glad you think that. I really am. Every time I ever want to do something like
[5079.94s -> 5084.84s]  this, I think the most important thing that I, I relay this to the people that are here too,
[5084.84s -> 5090.68s]  is the whole entire goal is to try to have as much fun as possible. I just, that's all I,
[5090.68s -> 5098.34s]  that's all I fucking want, I promise. And I think that when you have, when you bring in people
[5098.34s -> 5104.28s]  and everybody from this guy to this guy to this guy, to the people in the stands, to the people
[5104.28s -> 5108.20s]  that were running production, to all the people out here, and when it's clear that people are
[5108.20s -> 5116.49s]  having a good time, it is a good time. And that's undeniable that it was a fun time. Forget about
[5116.49s -> 5121.67s]  any of the technical problems that kind of drop the stream up and down a few times. Every time
[5121.67s -> 5127.03s]  a show happens, I, at the end of it, I sit down afterwards and I go, was that fun? Did people have
[5127.03s -> 5130.47s]  a good time? That's all I care about. And if the answer is yes, then all right, then that's great.
[5130.47s -> 5143.61s]  I'm glad we did it. There's never a moment where I'm, I'm not trying to like one-up like Dollhouse,
[5143.61s -> 5147.90s]  I think, right? Because Dollhouse was so ridiculous and so much went into that.
[5147.90s -> 5153.46s]  That was a multi-stream, multi-day event. I don't, I don't care about, you know, oh,
[5153.46s -> 5156.90s]  I gotta do something that's like Dollhouse. It's gotta be as big as Dollhouse. It's gotta be.
[5156.90s -> 5162.50s]  Dollhouse was, was, was an unbelievable, astronomical amount of money. Oh, okay, I've gotta,
[5162.50s -> 5167.54s]  I've gotta spend hundreds of thousands of dollars again on this one. That's not what happens. It's
[5167.54s -> 5172.92s]  just, I want to make something happen. If I think it's fun, then I want to do it. So there's never
[5172.92s -> 5179.11s]  a comparison. There's never like a, oh yeah, I mean that was all right, but like it fucking wasn't
[5179.11s -> 5185.77s]  as good as Dollhouse. This next stream, I gotta spend a million dollars on it to make sure it's
[5185.77s -> 5192.25s]  better than Dollhouse. No, that's not what I think about. It just wasn't good. Did I have a fun time?
[5192.25s -> 5198.30s]  Did everyone else there have a fun time? And it was the, the, did people watching think it was fun?
[5198.30s -> 5205.75s]  Yes. Good. Okay, let's do the next one now. The cost doesn't matter if it's a fun show.
[5206.95s -> 5214.28s]  Yeah, and I, I told, I did an interview. Me and Jake kind of sat down with Kotaku, if you saw the
[5214.28s -> 5220.87s]  article before the stream. And one of the questions that Kotaku, Kotaku editor or whatever asked was,
[5220.87s -> 5224.63s]  you know, what, like these big shows, right, when you do them, like how do you feel about them? And
[5225.67s -> 5231.34s]  do you think it's like moving the platform to a new place? And, but I'll kind of reiterate it again.
[5231.34s -> 5239.77s]  It's a lot, it's a lot of money. And it's, a lot of shit can go wrong. So thinking that,
[5239.77s -> 5244.49s]  oh, I wait, why don't more people do stuff like this? How come more people aren't doing this?
[5245.43s -> 5250.60s]  I want to see that do more. But when you think about it, it's like, it's, it's a lot of stress
[5250.60s -> 5255.66s]  and it's a lot of money. And some people don't fucking have that ability to do that. Right? Like
[5255.66s -> 5260.60s]  some people don't have hundreds of thousands of fucking dollars to throw at stuff like this.
[5260.60s -> 5266.52s]  They just don't. And that's something that I think I to understand is you, you try to do what you can
[5266.52s -> 5273.30s]  with what you have. And yeah, there's a lot of risk. There's a ton of risk. So I, I never want
[5273.30s -> 5280.42s]  to put myself on some kind of pedestal because I know like how stressful and how scary and shit it
[5280.42s -> 5285.19s]  is to try to put something like this on. That's why I never want to be like up there on like a
[5285.19s -> 5307.78s]  pedestal. I don't like it. Rich Randy. They're not as rich as you, but I, you're a humble billionaire.
[5307.78s -> 5313.27s]  No, but the point is, I guess the whole point of this is when you see the price tags of some
[5313.27s -> 5321.80s]  of these shows, maybe, and you hear about it. If I have, you know, like tens, if not hundreds
[5321.80s -> 5327.48s]  of thousands of dollars for a show, the show is going to be tens of thousands or hundreds of
[5327.48s -> 5330.84s]  thousands of dollars for the show. You know what I'm saying? It's like, if I have this opportunity,
[5330.84s -> 5335.42s]  which I'm lucky every fucking day to be here and sitting here doing this, if I'm given the opportunity
[5335.42s -> 5341.77s]  to be able to have somebody like Bansley come in and support the show, manscaped, right? Like I can
[5341.77s -> 5348.15s]  take in this money and yeah, let's do something fucking huge if I can. And look, this could have
[5348.15s -> 5355.75s]  just not been funny at all. This could have been terrible. This could have been so not funny and
[5355.75s -> 5364.14s]  shit. And it was like, well, you know what? We tried, right? We tried. So, but there's a lot of
[5364.14s -> 5372.55s]  risk that comes with this. And I, like I said, I never wanted to be thought of as like, oh yeah,
[5372.55s -> 5376.71s]  yeah, yeah. Of course this show isn't going to be, I mean, yeah. Oh, Jerma, you put on these
[5376.71s -> 5383.91s]  huge money shows and they're so fun. And well, I wish more people would do that. I'm in a fucking
[5383.91s -> 5396.36s]  crazy opportunity and I don't want to take for granted for any day of the week. It's a very unique
[5396.36s -> 5403.18s]  insane opportunity to be looking at these pictures, which is why I try to, I don't know.
[5403.18s -> 5410.49s]  I try to keep my brain grounded as much as I can. And like I said, before one of these shows goes
[5410.49s -> 5417.38s]  off, I'll be like in my hotel room and just be sitting there going like, fuck, I hope this is
[5417.38s -> 5426.34s]  fun. I hope this is funny. Whoa, this is, hope this works. The announcers were amazing. They were.
[5426.34s -> 5431.16s]  And speaking of hotel rooms, I've got to talk about this. This is important. You want to know
[5431.16s -> 5442.57s]  what I found out about a hotel room recently, staying in a hotel in St. Louis? You cannot
[5442.57s -> 5452.54s]  watch a horror movie in a hotel room. You can't watch a horror movie in a hotel room. I was
[5452.54s -> 5467.18s]  watching the Black Phone and I'm sitting there watching it. And every so often there's just
[5467.18s -> 5476.17s]  people screaming. And I'm just sitting there like, fucking turn the volume down. Like,
[5476.17s -> 5478.41s]  I swear to God, nobody's getting killed in here. You know what I mean? Like all,
[5479.05s -> 5487.53s]  when you go to a hotel room, you are surrounded by complete strangers sleeping in other rooms near you.
[5487.53s -> 5494.06s]  You can't fucking watch a horror movie in a hotel room. You'd have to sit there and just go like,
[5494.06s -> 5499.40s]  all right, let's put, this was a scary one. Let's put it on. The second that you hear that scream,
[5503.02s -> 5508.10s]  and then you fuck, I can't, now there's like something going on. I can't even hear the dialogue
[5508.10s -> 5515.48s]  because what do you, what did they say? I gotta, I can't watch this. And then you turn it all the
[5515.48s -> 5519.32s]  way down and you don't, you're missing dialogue. So you're like, fuck, I gotta turn it up, up,
[5519.32s -> 5524.60s]  up, up, up. I still can't hear it up, up, up, up, up. Another scream. And it's even louder than the
[5524.60s -> 5528.92s]  first one that you tried to correct with the volume decrease in the first place. And I'm just
[5528.92s -> 5534.60s]  imagining somebody walking down the hall, whether somebody from like a staff member of the hotel
[5534.60s -> 5538.28s]  or somebody like getting out, like, okay, kids, it's time to go to the water park.
[5538.28s -> 5548.76s]  And you just hear somebody screaming, fucking screaming for their life in this room. I just
[5548.76s -> 5556.02s]  can't. I can't. You can't watch a horror movie in a hotel room unless you turn it all the way down
[5556.02s -> 5565.53s]  really low and put on subtitles. And it sucks. It's such a pain in the ass because you have to
[5565.53s -> 5569.93s]  volume down, volume up, volume down, volume up. You're like this weird remote control
[5569.93s -> 5578.84s]  quarterback of the whole, and I just want to watch the movie. You paid for the room. Who cares?
[5582.36s -> 5587.03s]  Yeah, but like, dude, I don't know. It's like, I feel weird. I feel weird sitting here just
[5587.03s -> 5592.76s]  listening to somebody scream wicked loud in the hotel room. It's just like, fuck, I don't want
[5592.76s -> 5606.71s]  you to hear that. Self-conscious Samuel. It's just a movie. Don't worry. We'll back you up.
[5606.71s -> 5612.22s]  But the people in the stands, actors, know they were, I think they were like friends and family.
[5612.22s -> 5623.02s]  These guys were wild. They were having the time of their life. That was, that made me so happy.
[5623.02s -> 5627.85s]  Seeing how much fun all these guys were having was just like, all right, this is,
[5627.85s -> 5631.77s]  you're having a good time. You're having a good time. You just came up to the plate. You're doing
[5631.77s -> 5637.10s]  like this funny routine. You're loving it. I'm loving it. You know, this is great. I'm having a
[5637.10s -> 5646.33s]  blast. Bluetooth headphones exist. I don't, I'm not, I'm kind of a Bluetooth headphone.
[5646.33s -> 5660.94s]  I don't have a Bluetooth headphone. I doubt they would care. People have fistfights in hotel rooms.
[5660.94s -> 5665.98s]  If all I'm imagining is I'm sitting there watching and I'm like, you know what? I don't give a shit.
[5666.06s -> 5673.50s]  I paid for this room. I don't care. We're watching. I'm watching the Scream movies at full volume.
[5673.50s -> 5679.98s]  Right? I don't even care anymore. And then I get halfway through. I'm 20 minutes into the movie
[5679.98s -> 5685.13s]  and it's like, there's a knock at the front door. And I look out, it's like a hotel staff person.
[5685.13s -> 5689.30s]  Yeah, we're getting a noise complaint here that somebody was screaming in here. I'm just like,
[5689.30s -> 5693.38s]  ah, I knew it. I knew it. And one day it's going to happen and I'm going to, I was going to freak
[5693.38s -> 5707.54s]  me out. Why don't you have AirPods? I don't, I don't have ear pods. Yeah, this is the brawl.
[5707.54s -> 5716.90s]  And they, they took the brawl seriously. Yes, this was supposed to happen. It just, I can tell you,
[5716.90s -> 5721.22s]  I don't want to ruin the show, but it was really funny how this actually ended up. Should I do,
[5721.22s -> 5726.50s]  this is behind the scenes shit. Let's talk about it. Okay. So you want to hear the behind the
[5726.50s -> 5733.38s]  scenes of how fucked up the last like 20 minutes was? If you don't want to have the magic of the
[5733.38s -> 5740.25s]  show ruined, I would mute now and come back in 10 minutes. Okay. So do you see the inning that
[5740.25s -> 5743.37s]  we're in right now? This is the top of the 10th. This is, this is not, this is the bottom of the
[5743.37s -> 5752.78s]  10th inning. We went to extra innings. We were not supposed to go to extra innings. So what happened
[5752.78s -> 5760.97s]  was the magician's team was playing really well and it got to a point where they were ahead by
[5760.97s -> 5768.55s]  way too much because they had to be in their dugout or the crunch take routine because they
[5768.55s -> 5775.96s]  charge out of their dugout in the footage that we had already recorded. So we were like, oh shit,
[5775.96s -> 5781.80s]  we can't end the game because the magicians have to be in their dugout. They have to charge from
[5781.80s -> 5790.94s]  their dugout. So it was like, okay, I'm going to blow a bunch of shit calls and I'm going to make
[5790.94s -> 5803.51s]  sure that the game gets tied. So we go to extras. There you go. Now what happened in extras, I was
[5803.51s -> 5808.31s]  not, I couldn't control. We just needed to make sure that they got another at bat so they could
[5808.31s -> 5819.43s]  charge out to the field. Of course it's rigged you dummies LMAO. But it wasn't though. Okay,
[5819.43s -> 5827.37s]  we just lost track of the, okay, the entire game was not scripted. Well, hold on a second. Wait a
[5827.37s -> 5833.45s]  minute. If you have a problem with that, hold on a second. Those of you that have a problem with the
[5833.45s -> 5840.25s]  magicians getting that extra at bat, wait a minute, hold on here though. The California Circus got a
[5840.25s -> 5851.11s]  free run that was predetermined because of the mascot fight. Um, sorry. That circus run was a
[5851.11s -> 5868.86s]  predetermined run. They both got something extra. Double rigged. Is every stream you've ever done
[5868.86s -> 5880.58s]  scripted? No, not this one. This is the first one. The fact that it ended with the magicians
[5880.58s -> 5885.66s]  winning and then devolving into the funniest German moment in a long time is the best thing
[5885.66s -> 5895.43s]  about the baseball stream. Yeah, I mean, it was just fun. It was just, I knew it was going to be
[5895.43s -> 5901.53s]  fun. I think like Jake asked me this question. Some people in production, some of the performers
[5901.53s -> 5905.70s]  come up and then like, we like, we just talked about. So I like, I got approached by some people
[5905.70s -> 5911.27s]  on the crew and they're just like, why did you like do this? Well, what's the point of this?
[5911.27s -> 5920.58s]  Is it, are you like, why, why this? Why this? And I have the same answer and the answer I'll give you
[5920.58s -> 5926.58s]  too. The same answer I'll give anybody. I thought it would be funny. That's it. That's all it takes.
[5926.58s -> 5932.76s]  I saw in my head, okay, so before Dollhouse, the only reason why I wanted to do Dollhouse is
[5933.16s -> 5938.70s]  in my head, I was like imagining, I was kind of watching in my head people in these black spandex
[5938.70s -> 5945.59s]  suits, moving furniture around in like a house that I was like frozen in because it's like the
[5945.59s -> 5951.42s]  buy phase. And that was the only reason why I wanted to do it. That was like the sole reason to be
[5951.42s -> 5954.54s]  like, I'm going to start writing it and I want to write the whole thing and I want to get the
[5954.54s -> 5960.36s]  whole thing the way I want it. It's like a one joke is what makes me want to do something. And
[5960.36s -> 5966.74s]  the one joke that I wanted to do here that made the whole thing happen was this end of the game
[5966.74s -> 5972.82s]  thing. The fact that it's not just this game, oh look, hey, here we are at crunch time. I'm going
[5972.82s -> 5977.66s]  to go with the other games to me was like, that was why I wanted to do the show because that would
[5977.66s -> 5983.06s]  be funny. And that's it. So after that one thing that I see in my head that I think is interesting
[5983.06s -> 5986.74s]  or funny enough for me is when I go, okay, so now how do I make a whole thing out of this? How do
[5986.74s -> 5992.87s]  I do a whole show? How would I do it? And then I'm like, you know, I start like writing. Okay,
[5992.87s -> 5997.03s]  so the German Baseball Association, I guess that's what it is. Okay, so here we are, blah, blah, blah,
[5997.03s -> 6001.35s]  and this is what's happening and this is a beautiful day and whatever. And I just sort
[6001.35s -> 6007.14s]  of write a bunch of jokes and a bunch of things that I want to do and see. Then I get on the phone
[6007.14s -> 6013.53s]  and I start talking to Community Jake, who is the production guy. He's like the, yeah, let's try to
[6013.53s -> 6019.91s]  make that happen. I send him the, all the stuff that I write and we go back and forth for months
[6019.91s -> 6030.25s]  and then it happens. Admit it, you just want to be Brewster's Millions IRL. What a specific reference.
[6030.25s -> 6047.50s]  The baseballs are sold out again? What? Hold on, the baseball, the souvenir baseballs are gone.
[6047.50s -> 6060.09s]  What? What was the replacement? What was the thing that started the Who Replaced Me? What joke was
[6060.09s -> 6065.78s]  that that made that happen? Very simple. It was me sitting behind somebody with a clipboard
[6065.78s -> 6071.56s]  and then pretending to be me while I like coach them to be me. That was it. That was like what
[6071.56s -> 6076.73s]  started the rest of it. Like I just saw me with a clipboard like, I'm sorry, you didn't do the look
[6076.73s -> 6081.51s]  at me right. That was enough. It's usually one thing gets me going and then I just start like
[6081.51s -> 6090.55s]  writing stuff. Remember, your entire stream was an American Dad episode, I'm not kidding.
[6091.03s -> 6097.51s]  Yeah, it was also a Simpsons episode too. No, Futurama. It was also in Futurama.
[6097.51s -> 6102.78s]  Only the game used balls are sold out. Okay, all right, all right.
[6112.18s -> 6116.10s]  I don't think that, look, the idea of like a cartoon baseball league with a bunch of
[6116.10s -> 6121.69s]  jokey baseball is not a new idea but it's an idea that I wanted to do, right, and to see if I could
[6121.69s -> 6135.93s]  make it fun. It's not a new idea. Both are out of stock? Really? Oh, shit. Okay, they both are out
[6135.93s -> 6150.18s]  of stock. Both are. That's impossible. That's impossible. Should I do more? We want more.
[6150.18s -> 6154.09s]  Should I just make that up? Did somebody actually say that? Should I just make that up?
[6154.09s -> 6168.87s]  Should I restock it again? Get to signing. Yes, please, please, please. Jesus. All right, let me
[6170.38s -> 6180.78s]  hold on. Let me talk. I got to talk to Community Jake because I can see if it's like, is it possible
[6180.78s -> 6193.46s]  for me to do more? How many? I have to figure out how many that are going to be available.
[6193.46s -> 6198.52s]  All right, I'll get back to your next stream. We might do another restocking so keep an eye out.
[6198.52s -> 6206.89s]  A third, a second time or at least the balls. What was the joke that started the archaeology
[6206.89s -> 6218.06s]  stream? Me and Holly breaking a geode outside. It was like, it was like just fun to do. We got a
[6218.06s -> 6226.02s]  geode one day and I was like, oh, this is cool. This sounds fun. And it was like, all right,
[6226.02s -> 6234.46s]  now let's make up this whole thing. To FPS Andy, I can't fix it. I can't fix it. I can't fix it.
[6234.46s -> 6241.34s]  I can't fix it. I'm sorry. Look, on the next stream, I will make sure that I'm on the right
[6241.34s -> 6246.02s]  server. Whether that's, oh, I have to go to Dallas. You're going to try this? Try Dallas.
[6246.02s -> 6257.70s]  Try Chicago. Try Mexico. Try San Francisco. Try San Jose. Try Boston. I'm going to jump around to
[6257.70s -> 6271.10s]  every server again and just run a upload test and then try it again and we'll do it again.
[6271.10s -> 6286.58s]  Just fix it. I wish it were that easy. He only knows five cities. Try harder. Your favorite
[6286.58s -> 6294.82s]  character Morty was added to multiverses. Oh, we'll play it. You bet your ass we will. All right,
[6294.82s -> 6299.75s]  let's keep going. But yeah, this was, we had to make sure the magicians were going to come out
[6299.75s -> 6307.22s]  at the right time. You know what's really funny about this though? I think there's a few clips
[6307.22s -> 6310.58s]  of this when it's, when we said, all right, that's it. We're out. Like, that's it. That's it. That's
[6310.58s -> 6319.34s]  it. A lot of these guys knew each other and see they're like kind of, you know, hugging it out.
[6319.34s -> 6324.14s]  Like that was a fun day. It's really cool. It was awesome to see it. Like once ever that was,
[6324.14s -> 6338.20s]  oh wow, you can see, you can pie right in the face right here. When are you going to do Mr. Satan?
[6338.20s -> 6355.82s]  Um, like a whole stream? An entire stream of Mr. Satan. Oh, this is footage. Well, I mean,
[6355.82s -> 6360.39s]  let me, I can, let me show this. Somebody has like from the stands footage of the whole fight.
[6360.39s -> 6370.20s]  Hold on, give me one sec. This guy was just spinning around with it. Uh, give me, let me,
[6370.20s -> 6381.24s]  let me add this. This is paused, right? Yep. We got a, we got a video from the stands here.
[6381.24s -> 6389.90s]  Make sure it's not too loud. Hold on. Where's the, there it is. Who are the audience members?
[6389.90s -> 6394.78s]  The audience members were friends and family. Although some people were, uh, kind of, I guess,
[6394.78s -> 6400.34s]  screened at the door and were allowed to come in eventually. So, but like we did have, we had
[6400.34s -> 6405.83s]  security at the doors and eventually it was like they were screened and they were like allowed to
[6405.83s -> 6412.84s]  come in, I think is how it worked. But for the most part, people were not allowed in. But where,
[6412.84s -> 6431.42s]  where are the, there it is. Okay. Okay. This, sorry. There's a black screen. That's my fault.
[6434.30s -> 6475.93s]  That's my fault. Here it is. Okay. So here is from the stands. That's insane. Yeah. I think at this
[6475.93s -> 6481.70s]  point it was over. I think we, I think we, I think they cut out already here. Oh my God. He got all,
[6481.70s -> 6492.28s]  oh my God. I didn't even see that. What? Oh my God. Holy shit. They all taking their clothes off.
[6492.28s -> 6506.34s]  This wasn't even in the show. He got stuck in. Yeah. See, I got pied again. See, look at me.
[6506.34s -> 6518.70s]  I'm on the left over there. I got, I got another pie directly in the face. That's so funny. That's
[6518.70s -> 6536.28s]  awesome. Uncensored. Shaving cream in the eyes. I lost my place here. Where was I? Can you guys
[6536.28s -> 6546.06s]  help me here? We were much further than this. This is the beginning of the day. Close your
[6546.06s -> 6560.36s]  eyes for a second because it's going to be annoying to look at. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Close your
[6560.36s -> 6574.74s]  eyes. Like I'm serious. Like I don't want to annoy anybody. These pictures are awesome. Leather jacket
[6574.74s -> 6583.90s]  took these by the way. It's cool to have a leather jacket who's a mod was there. I think we were
[6583.90s -> 6603.86s]  around here. It was after the cigarettes. It was right at the fight, right? Hold on. And here we,
[6605.78s -> 6612.97s]  and here we. Have you guys noticed that everybody that does a Joker impression now
[6612.97s -> 6618.82s]  does like a bunch of mouth sounds and that's, that's the impression. So let me tell you
[6618.82s -> 6630.17s]  nothing. That's like, that's a Joker impression now. We can let it play from here. Yeah. If you
[6630.17s -> 6641.50s]  want to do a Joker impression, lean in. You see, we got to kill the Batman. And there's like, oh,
[6641.50s -> 6656.23s]  he did it. He did a, that's a good Joker. I love your new stash. It's probably not going to stay
[6656.23s -> 6661.51s]  because it's really annoying. This kind of like sucks to have on if I'm honest, because my hair
[6661.51s -> 6668.95s]  is not full enough to be able to do it. So it's just these little spine wires stabbing into every
[6668.95s -> 6680.46s]  section of my lip, like above here. I hate it. Also here, like I was saying, these pass by,
[6680.46s -> 6685.26s]  but again, here we are. This is in between an inning. This is while you guys are on commercial
[6685.26s -> 6691.51s]  break or while you're away. Here we are. How's it looking? How's this going? Look good. You got it.
[6691.51s -> 6694.15s]  You got to just start doing this. All right. I'm going to start doing that now. Okay. You do that
[6694.15s -> 6701.54s]  now. Okay. Go, go, go, go back. Keep the whiskers. You have to trim it. I know, but I'd say it's kind
[6701.54s -> 6712.49s]  of annoying. I don't like it. But yeah, let me, let me figure out what the whole baseball stuff
[6712.49s -> 6718.81s]  signing. Here we go. Okay. Yeah. We'll go from here because I did not expect that we're going
[6718.81s -> 6727.19s]  to go again that quickly. So let me talk to Jake and see what he says. Shave it off on stream. Nah,
[6727.19s -> 6734.52s]  nah, nah. I'm sorry that the internet is screwed up. It's not my internet. My internet is completely
[6734.52s -> 6741.54s]  fine. I promise you. It's just this bounce around. Yeah. I don't want to be a broken record. I don't
[6741.54s -> 6749.80s]  want to just run in circles, but I'm sorry that it's annoying right now. Nair it off. Oh no,
[6749.80s -> 6760.44s]  I already did the shaving bit. Yeah. Did I ever tell you about what didn't happen? I think I've
[6760.44s -> 6766.71s]  probably talked about it. Okay. The, the hot air balloon thing to go from Boston to Vegas. I told
[6766.71s -> 6772.23s]  you guys that I wanted to find, but found footage that somebody had from like a dash cam of a bunch
[6772.23s -> 6782.34s]  of crazy shit that happened up in the air. Did I ever tell you that? Like there was going to be a
[6782.34s -> 6786.74s]  dash cam on the hot air balloon. I was in front of a green screen, green, green screen going to
[6786.74s -> 6791.90s]  record a bunch of footage of just crazy shit happening up there. Like getting invaded by pirates
[6791.90s -> 6795.74s]  and like eating people and shit. Like it was going to be nuts and it was going to be,
[6795.74s -> 6800.38s]  oh dude, we like found this. Like this was a, some, some, some, some hot air balloon dash cam.
[6800.38s -> 6808.10s]  It's like lawless insanity up there, but I never recorded it. That never happened either. Oh no,
[6808.10s -> 6821.72s]  he's, they got him. They got him. They got, they cut ball boy with the big cartoon hammer. Oh my
[6821.72s -> 6829.56s]  God, what a mess. This sucks. No, yeah, that sucks. He's, that's the, here's the best part.
[6829.56s -> 6835.22s]  Right now he is going, oh fuck, fuck, fuck, ow, ow, ow. And he's like, hold on, man. Don't touch it.
[6835.22s -> 6842.54s]  Don't touch it, man. Don't touch it, dude. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. I know what that's like.
[6842.54s -> 6852.81s]  Yeah, I know what it's like. It sucks. And then, yeah, this is great. Once it was like, hey,
[6852.81s -> 6856.17s]  it's all good and done. This was, this is the coach for the magicians. It was joy handsome.
[6856.17s -> 6866.98s]  No, it was a great time. It's real. I didn't get to see these. So this is really, I'm really happy
[6866.98s -> 6880.49s]  about this. At this point, everyone's got their clothes off. Everyone's clothes are all off.
[6884.82s -> 6900.39s]  The hat, the hair, like pulled back. These, these are fucking great. Oh my God. Holy shit.
[6900.39s -> 6922.98s]  Kookie the Clown. Kookie the Clown is, is fucking stacked. Holy shit. Whoa. This photo is fucking
[6922.98s -> 6936.87s]  crazy. This photo is crazy. This is an insane photo. This is my favorite photo of the whole night.
[6936.87s -> 6947.37s]  No wonder he snapped Dumbledore's neck. Awesome. Yeah, but these are all, so these are all the
[6947.37s -> 6955.13s]  performers and the players. And if you go kind of like one by one here, you can kind of see,
[6955.13s -> 6962.74s]  you remember who they were. They're such a great group. Truly a great group. I'm just ecstatic
[6962.74s -> 6968.97s]  about it. They were so much fun. God, I feel like it's like, oh, remember when, remember when that
[6968.97s -> 6976.25s]  happened? Oh, you remember? This was like a week ago. I'm like, oh, remember? You remember? It was
[6976.25s -> 6987.30s]  like six days ago. Oh yeah. Everyone, there were a lot of like at the end of the night, like selfies
[6987.30s -> 6998.82s]  and stuff. Look at this fucking mustache. And everyone's saying, dude, why do you make the same
[6998.82s -> 7006.07s]  face in every photo? I don't know. You make different faces in your, if it's like, hey,
[7006.07s -> 7011.26s]  let's get a picture. It's like, I don't like make, I just like, this is, that's my take a photo face.
[7011.26s -> 7022.89s]  It's just like, is that weird? You saw the post? Of course I saw the post. I always make the same,
[7022.89s -> 7026.73s]  yeah, you make like this, because you know why you make the same face in every single photo?
[7026.73s -> 7031.70s]  Because you know exactly what that face looks like. If you change it up, right, if you like,
[7031.70s -> 7038.50s]  you practice that take a photo face, like, okay, you change that up. I don't know what the fuck
[7038.50s -> 7042.42s]  that looks like. I have no idea what that looks like. I'm not doing that. I have no idea what I
[7042.42s -> 7046.49s]  look like. I might look like a crazy, I might look like a fucking weirdo. I might be like,
[7046.49s -> 7050.98s]  I might look crazed. No, you have the one face that you know exactly what it looks like and you do
[7050.98s -> 7062.06s]  it every time. Too much teeth. Yeah. Too much teeth. It's like, or too little teeth is like,
[7062.06s -> 7078.07s]  no, I got it down. It's nice lifeless eyes. It's a photo. I'm sorry. I'm not like, what do you want?
[7078.55s -> 7085.61s]  It's a, you're taking a picture. And by the way, the fire breathing,
[7085.61s -> 7089.67s]  didn't think there was going to be a fire breather on that stream. You didn't think
[7089.67s -> 7094.07s]  there was going to be a legit guy breathing fucking flames out of his mouth for like five
[7094.07s -> 7103.46s]  straight minutes. But yeah, that's the photos and it was awesome. I'm glad I got to share that.
[7103.46s -> 7113.67s]  Special huge thanks to Leather Jacket. Leather Jacket came out here and did all this. Big shout
[7113.67s -> 7131.72s]  out to Leather Jacket for this. And that was the show. That was the baseball show. Tell us about
[7131.72s -> 7138.06s]  the guy whose pants caught on fire. Uh, the guy whose pants caught on fire. What do you mean?
[7138.06s -> 7176.09s]  Hold on. Let me see. Who's pants caught on fire? Let me see. I mean, that's a trained professional,
[7176.09s -> 7183.72s]  but you know, sometimes you get, I mean that, that, that, that's, this is, this is a trained
[7183.72s -> 7197.18s]  professional. You know what he's doing. He's good. He knows he's done. We're good. Multi-talented.
[7197.18s -> 7207.26s]  Yeah. When the fire breather was going, like he was taking his fingers and splitting the fire.
[7207.26s -> 7219.19s]  So the fire was just coming out of two different sides. Just BAM! Boom! Boom! Would you ever do
[7219.19s -> 7225.75s]  director's commentary over one of your big streams? Um, I think stuff like this is good.
[7226.31s -> 7233.86s]  Showing like some clips and pictures and stuff. But I, I do, I really like the, the notion that
[7233.86s -> 7237.70s]  you don't get to really know everything. I'd rather you guys not know every single detail
[7237.70s -> 7245.53s]  because it's more fun that way. This kind of is that. Yeah. This is it right now. But I don't,
[7245.53s -> 7249.45s]  I don't want to, you know, line by line after everything that happens, pause and be like,
[7249.45s -> 7256.52s]  so this is how that happened. I'd rather have at least a little bit of magic and mystery behind
[7256.52s -> 7265.03s]  it. Right? How many people were not actually baseball players, but just performers? Uh,
[7265.03s -> 7275.18s]  I believe we had 11, no, 14 people that were not baseball players and 22 or 23 or 24. I think there
[7275.18s -> 7283.88s]  were 24 baseball players and we were just kind of putting them, cycling them in and out. You told
[7283.88s -> 7292.09s]  us it was rigged. Yeah, but I didn't say how much of it was. Did you do like a big party or anything
[7292.09s -> 7303.46s]  after the event? No. I mean, the show ended on, um, the show went till what? Like midnight Eastern,
[7303.46s -> 7308.92s]  1 a.m. Eastern is when it really turned off. So it's not like, oh, hey guys, it's like
[7308.92s -> 7313.59s]  midnight. It's time to go to dinner. And I was like, everyone was tired. Like this,
[7313.59s -> 7321.13s]  get some good rest. Uh, take care of yourselves. It wasn't really anything else really going on.
[7321.13s -> 7330.12s]  Exhausted. Yeah, probably exhausted. Talk about the man on the ball. It's a performer. Every time
[7330.12s -> 7334.41s]  you saw somebody do something like this, they, that was, that was a performer that has a lot of
[7334.41s -> 7345.00s]  experience in, you know, acrobatics, um, tricks, juggling, uh, circus type performances. They can
[7345.00s -> 7351.08s]  move around really quickly. Uh, very animated. They were awesome. Anytime that you saw something
[7351.08s -> 7359.90s]  like that happen, it was one of these guys. One of the magicians commented on my fan art. That's
[7359.90s -> 7372.18s]  awesome. Yeah, I've seen on Twitter, they've been tweeting stuff out. That makes me happy.
[7372.18s -> 7378.04s]  That means they had, that means they had fun. It'd be one thing if they were, okay. So if they,
[7378.04s -> 7382.68s]  if nobody said anything after the show, if it was like, oh, thank you. That was so much fun. Yeah.
[7382.68s -> 7388.74s]  Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. And then everyone was dead silent afterwards. Nobody said anything. We never
[7388.74s -> 7394.81s]  heard from any of the players ever again. It'd be like, oh, I hope they was, whatever. That's a good
[7394.81s -> 7410.26s]  sign that they were tweeting out pictures. What about the bunny? Oh, the bunny trick. Yeah. I
[7410.26s -> 7414.68s]  didn't even know that. I didn't even know that was going to happen. He did like a, he did like a,
[7414.68s -> 7426.30s]  a rabbit trick. We pulled a rabbit out of a hat. I was like, holy shit, that's really happening.
[7426.30s -> 7432.23s]  It's too bad because that was right. We were having the most kind of internet issues at that
[7432.23s -> 7438.26s]  exact moment. So he did a whole trick and we really only got to see kind of the end of it.
[7438.26s -> 7448.33s]  Did you know the commentators from somewhere? They're amazing. They were a connection to
[7448.33s -> 7454.66s]  somebody on the production team. So somebody on the production team had a contact to,
[7454.66s -> 7458.58s]  because they do actual broadcast baseball. They do, I think, college games and minor league games,
[7458.58s -> 7469.93s]  I think. They live and breathe that. We got real broadcasters. That's what they do.
[7469.93s -> 7481.77s]  Were you actually frustrated during the event or was it an act? Yeah, it's part of the gig,
[7481.77s -> 7491.74s]  right? I mean, it's part of the fun. I was actually, there was a point where I was genuinely upset
[7491.74s -> 7496.06s]  and it was when I got in my ear for the first time that we were like dropping frames.
[7496.06s -> 7508.82s]  And I was just like, nowhere we can't be, right? So I was a little pissed off at that point.
[7508.82s -> 7515.19s]  After another inning went by, they turned it off, changed servers, went back to normal.
[7515.19s -> 7523.88s]  Not another problem the entire rest of the night. So I went from like being annoyed to, oh, thank
[7523.88s -> 7528.28s]  God, thank God that like the last two hours of the show was fine. Thank goodness it's not,
[7528.28s -> 7531.32s]  because one of the things I was really concerned about when we started actually having those
[7531.32s -> 7536.33s]  internet like ingest whatever they were problems, there was a loud fuck on stream at one point.
[7536.33s -> 7543.61s]  Oh, that was fake. Yeah, that was early on. Oh, the fuck, the loud fuck. I know exactly
[7543.61s -> 7552.78s]  what you're talking about. Do we have a clip? Fuck. Yeah. Yep. No, that was fake. That was
[7552.78s -> 7560.63s]  before we even started having problems. That was, I remember trying to make it real. And I think
[7560.63s -> 7569.06s]  yeah, that was definitely not real. That was like in the second inning. I was only irritated from
[7569.46s -> 7575.02s]  the bottom of the fourth inning to the top of the sixth inning, because I knew we were having a
[7575.02s -> 7586.17s]  bunch of problems up in the truck. But from what I have been told, it was okay. Some points were
[7586.17s -> 7591.42s]  kind of bad, but it was watchable for a lot of that, like the fourth and fifth inning,
[7591.42s -> 7597.27s]  from what I've been told. It was like, okay. It sounded authentic. Let me see.
[7597.27s -> 7642.89s]  Okay, I say that's out, that's out. Oh my God, that was violent.
[7642.89s -> 7648.26s]  What? Oh, it's because I got the pie in the face. It was from the, because I got hit with the pie
[7648.26s -> 7664.92s]  and I'm irritated. I'm like throwing some people out. Oh, yeah. On top of it. Polka dot.
[7664.92s -> 7667.72s]  Apologize for the language. Our effects, Mike, sometimes picks up some.
[7669.53s -> 7677.26s]  Okay, that's actually funny. That's actually really funny. No, I was not actually mad. I was,
[7677.26s -> 7682.36s]  I mean, I guess I was supposed to be, because this is right after the pie. And this, I threw
[7682.36s -> 7689.03s]  out like three people. Explain what happens here. So they're going to give second base to Smith
[7689.03s -> 7695.50s]  and run another run scored. I do believe so it should be five, nothing run scores. Albertson
[7695.50s -> 7707.80s]  confirms right on top of it. Do the people in the stands must've thought I was insane
[7707.80s -> 7712.04s]  because I remember I was turned toward the audience and I like screamed it out like towards
[7712.04s -> 7733.29s]  the audience. All four of them. You imagine? Super aggressive. Oh, it sounded like a stock
[7733.29s -> 7739.88s]  sound effect. Why did I do that? I don't, I don't know, because I figured it was appropriate to
[7739.88s -> 7753.74s]  yell that. Cause I'm, I don't know. I feel like it was appropriate. Who was the fan you kicked out?
[7753.74s -> 7759.62s]  Oh, I forget what they were saying. They were saying something. It was, what were they saying?
[7759.62s -> 7763.46s]  Oh, it was something so specific and I can't remember it, but it was, they said it like
[7764.18s -> 7772.09s]  five or six times behind me. And wasn't there a seven year old there? I mean,
[7781.75s -> 7793.99s]  I mean, I, I don't know. Somebody said you're closer to the ground than I am. How could you
[7793.99s -> 7801.30s]  have missed that? That's probably what it was. That's probably what it was. Family friendly.
[7801.30s -> 7806.82s]  Well, no, we did tell, okay, we did tell everybody that was going to come, that this was a comedy.
[7806.82s -> 7813.50s]  This was like a, I like a potential R rated comedy routine. We did say that. We did say this
[7813.50s -> 7824.57s]  was a comedy show. This is a comedy show. And Fansly was the sponsor. You should have thrown out the
[7824.57s -> 7830.95s]  seven year old. That's probably, I don't know. What do you want me to say? Did you have fun?
[7830.95s -> 7836.52s]  Yeah, it was fucking awesome. You kicked out the seven year old. No, I did not. I did not kick out
[7836.52s -> 7841.96s]  anybody that was, they, unless they were yelling things at me and I threw them out. And the person
[7841.96s -> 7847.64s]  that I threw out is they knew it was a joke and they didn't think it was serious. You're a bad
[7847.64s -> 7873.72s]  influence. You missed, when the mascot started fighting, the kid's dad picks him up. Uh, it's
[7873.72s -> 7894.60s]  real? That's real. No way. No way. Actually real. Actually real. So you're telling me at this point
[7894.60s -> 7905.18s]  where the mascots are fighting and a little kid gets picked up. All right. Well, whatever. I,
[7905.18s -> 7916.97s]  do you, that, I didn't, I got nothing to do with that. Remember we were at PAX East 2018. This
[7916.97s -> 7921.45s]  little 10 year old with his dad approached you and said he was a big fan and I could just see
[7921.45s -> 7926.33s]  the shock on your face because he definitely shouldn't have been watching you. Yeah, I remember
[7926.33s -> 7947.02s]  that. Hey, Wendy, listen, when you come to this stream, you have to click a button. You have to,
[7947.02s -> 7951.40s]  you have to click a button. That button says something very specific. What does it say?
[7951.40s -> 7959.21s]  This broadcast is intended for mature audiences. Okay. You have to click that button. And look,
[7959.21s -> 7968.63s]  I can't, I cannot stop somebody from coming here. If somebody is not like 18 and they're,
[7968.63s -> 7973.27s]  oh, this is a mature stream. It's 18. Oh, it's at least, at least, you know, at least you gotta be
[7973.27s -> 7980.86s]  at least certain age. I can't look into this screen and see fucking how old you are. This
[7980.86s -> 7995.56s]  broadcast is for clowns only. Look, I will say this. I hope it comes off as, I hope it comes off
[7995.56s -> 8001.86s]  this way. Look, listen, listen to me. Look, listen, listen, listen, listen to me. Okay. Hear me out.
[8001.86s -> 8006.63s]  Listen to me. That's how you know about to start talking. That's how, okay. Oh, hey, hey, is Jeremy
[8006.63s -> 8011.21s]  going to start talking? Oh, hear me out. Listen to me for a sec. That's like before every sentence
[8011.21s -> 8017.93s]  I've ever said. Okay. But listen to me for real. I try to have this stream be a fun place. It's,
[8017.93s -> 8023.11s]  I try to be like positive about shit. I try not to be like doing anything too bad or fucked up.
[8023.11s -> 8027.19s]  You know what I mean? Like I try to have it be like a decent moments for, I try to have it be fun.
[8027.19s -> 8039.80s]  It doesn't show the fight. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You look like
[8039.80s -> 8047.53s]  dad about to give me the talk. All right. But listen, I'm a little crass, but I genuinely want
[8047.53s -> 8056.89s]  people to leave this stream with like, oh, I had fun, right? That's it. I cannot control who is here.
[8056.89s -> 8066.25s]  I can't. All I can do is put the warnings up, right? But whatever. You know what? Whatever.
[8066.25s -> 8075.32s]  What do you want me to say? I'm wearing the Jek shirt because I feel fucking strong today.
[8075.32s -> 8080.04s]  How are babies made? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I've been trying to figure it out
[8080.04s -> 8086.90s]  for years. A bird flies in and drops it off like a big stork comes into your window. I still don't
[8086.90s -> 8108.22s]  understand. I don't know. There's no more. I've used it all. I've used all of it. Not this,
[8108.22s -> 8118.97s]  not just today. All right. So what are the questions we got? Any more questions for me?
[8118.97s -> 8124.60s]  We've been here for like two and a half hours. Holy shit. You do no more coke? I don't do drugs
[8124.60s -> 8136.44s]  besides marijuana. It's the only one. And maybe alcohol every four or five months. Are you going
[8136.44s -> 8149.59s]  to go to TwitchCon? I don't think so. I do not have a plan to go to TwitchCon. Are you going to
[8149.59s -> 8167.78s]  stream Spyro 2? No, I'm not. Did you add anything to the Reddit shelf? There is going to be something
[8167.78s -> 8171.98s]  on the Reddit shelf. There's a baseball up there now, but it's just there temporarily. What is
[8171.98s -> 8177.98s]  going to go up there is the umpire mask. I've got to clean it up though. It's still kind of disgusting.
[8177.98s -> 8182.84s]  So the umpire mask is going to go up on the shelf somewhere. That's going to be added to the Reddit
[8182.84s -> 8201.14s]  shelf. You're going to stream Slime Rancher 2? Yes. 100%. Are you on Push to Talk? Nope. Oh yeah.
[8201.70s -> 8209.38s]  The new trophies came in for the streamer awards. Can you see them? You can see them
[8209.38s -> 8215.74s]  right next to each other. Look at how much bigger than they are. Cutie sent out replacements for the
[8215.74s -> 8225.06s]  ones. They're awesome. Yeah, those things are unbelievable. They grew in size. I gotta move
[8225.06s -> 8241.26s]  some stuff around on the red shelf. You gonna do another infomercial stream? Well, maybe. Since all
[8241.26s -> 8252.90s]  the game-used baseballs are gone, can you replace them with the ass-used ones? Can we see your next
[8252.90s -> 8272.90s]  big show live? I mean, here's... Why is everybody omega-lulling? What happened? Why are people
[8272.90s -> 8280.97s]  omega-lulling? What's going on? There's a lot of omega-lulls and I don't know why. What's happening?
[8280.97s -> 8292.95s]  Why did you read that? Read what? What did I read? What did I do? The asshole ball thing. Oh. Oh,
[8292.95s -> 8305.02s]  I mean, that was a delayed omega-lull reaction. How much would that sell for? I'm just thinking,
[8305.02s -> 8310.31s]  remember, you clicked mature audience right when you fucking came here. What would that sell for?
[8310.31s -> 8317.67s]  What would that actually sell for if it was a fucking open auction? Open auction? No. It was
[8317.67s -> 8329.02s]  open for like a month. You think that would go for more than... Do you think that would go for more
[8329.02s -> 8342.30s]  than $10,000? What is this? What's in mod chat right now? Germa F? What is this? What sound
[8342.30s -> 8360.09s]  effect is this? At most $60,000 minimum. No, it would not. I would pay $2,000 unironically.
[8360.81s -> 8370.81s]  Oh, really? Really? Germa's ass baseball would pay $2,000 for this baseball. Judging by that,
[8370.81s -> 8382.26s]  the fact that that's your username, I would imagine that would be a lot higher. So you're telling me
[8382.26s -> 8389.14s]  that if I sold... Like, let's... You say I could get 50 fucking grand for each one of these. Are
[8389.14s -> 8397.51s]  you shitting me? So if I just... If I sold 10 ass baseballs for half a million dollars, are you
[8397.51s -> 8421.51s]  kidding me? What an investment? What the fuck? Oh, man. I really need to find sponsors. These shows
[8421.51s -> 8426.07s]  are really expensive. Oh, yeah. I signed with Evolves. They're going to be doing a bunch of
[8426.07s -> 8431.67s]  sponsorships. It's today's sponsor stream. Oh, tomorrow. Yeah, I got sponsored by this. But
[8431.67s -> 8448.25s]  put 10 baseballs up your ass and pay for every fucking show. Really? Really? Do 10 to 20
[8448.25s -> 8454.86s]  baseballs and you have the budget for the next fucking year or two of shows. Really, guys? Are
[8454.86s -> 8472.06s]  you kidding me? Really? Are you serious with me? It's that easy. Can you imagine the articles? Oh,
[8473.82s -> 8481.34s]  E-Clown live streamer Jeremy Elbertson decides to actually, actually have his Fansley account
[8481.34s -> 8486.62s]  where he's selling shoved baseballs up his ass to do what he loves. And that's put on the next
[8486.62s -> 8511.48s]  big stream and it's going to cover everything. What the hell? Ball Fondler was right. No,
[8511.48s -> 8515.08s]  that's never going to happen. I'm just saying, I'm just making the argument to,
[8517.66s -> 8524.30s]  I just have to put 10 baseballs near my ass and I would have enough money to do anything.
[8524.30s -> 8530.52s]  Like, what the fuck? Oh, we really got to figure out how we're going to pay for this show.
[8530.52s -> 8535.16s]  I get on the phone with Community Jake. Yep. Okay. It's going to cost this. This is going to cost
[8535.16s -> 8538.44s]  this. Well, if we really want to get that, it's going to cost this. That's a lot of fucking money.
[8538.44s -> 8541.56s]  Okay. Yeah, it's going to go. How are we going to have to reach out to some sponsors? That's going
[8541.64s -> 8545.32s]  to take months. It's going to take months. It's going to take months of back and forth figuring
[8545.32s -> 8554.01s]  it out. Or 10 baseballs up your ass, Jeremy. I don't know why that, I actually don't know if
[8554.01s -> 8560.23s]  that's been on the ground. I actually, that may have, that actually may have fallen on the ground.
[8560.23s -> 8565.53s]  I don't know why I did that. That was probably, I'm going to brush my, I'm going to brush my teeth.
[8565.53s -> 8569.77s]  I'll be back in a minute. I'll be back in one minute. I'm actually just going to wash my mouth.
[8569.77s -> 8744.23s]  That's kind of gross, but I'm good. That's gross. But yeah, what were we, what were we saying? What
[8744.23s -> 8753.14s]  were we talking about? How much for that chapstick? No, we're not, we're not doing this anymore. I need
[8753.14s -> 8757.59s]  to get away from this topic. We're not doing this anymore. Yeah, I should have just moved on. I
[8757.59s -> 8763.51s]  should have came back and moved on. But isn't that insane to think about that? All the meetings,
[8763.51s -> 8771.61s]  the dozens of meetings, dozens of them, figuring out how to pay for this show, dozens of them,
[8771.61s -> 8775.53s]  different going, trying to find like, you know, the meetings and okay, like, let's go, let's go,
[8775.53s -> 8780.87s]  let's get down to business here. It's like, sometimes you think you're just like, what the
[8780.87s -> 8792.25s]  fuck, man? Good salad. All right. I was going to maybe do something. I think I'm probably going
[8792.25s -> 8800.30s]  to call the stream here because for a couple things. One, I didn't think I was going to sit
[8800.30s -> 8804.15s]  here for more than two or three hours. So I'm here for two and a half hours. There's a couple
[8804.15s -> 8807.59s]  things that I, with the baseball show in particular that I need, there's some loose ends I want to
[8807.59s -> 8814.98s]  tie up. There's a couple things I need to do here to get prepared and kind of tie up with the show.
[8814.98s -> 8821.00s]  I know like there was one stream a week, Andy. I know it's been like that at least the last week
[8821.00s -> 8829.96s]  since the show, but I'm not quite ready to come back, but I did want to do this. Just another
[8829.96s -> 8834.44s]  day or two. That's not going to be long. And then here's the thing. This next show that I'm talking
[8834.44s -> 8841.26s]  about is at least two or three months away. So we're going to go back to normal to about the
[8841.26s -> 8845.90s]  end of the year. So we're just back to kind of normal, just chilling out, playing games,
[8845.90s -> 8852.36s]  messing around. Regular streams are going to come back. We'll go back to normal and then another
[8852.36s -> 8862.62s]  few months, we'll be back at it again, doing the same shit. Only this one, I don't even know.
[8862.62s -> 8866.22s]  I genuinely don't even know what's going to happen because I had an idea of what was going to happen
[8866.22s -> 8873.61s]  with this show and even with Dollhouse. But this one coming up, guys, I have no fucking idea.
[8873.61s -> 8881.00s]  It's going to be fun though. I hope so. But yeah, also keep an eye out for Grotto Beast. Grotto Beast
[8881.00s -> 8888.10s]  is coming very soon. I want that to be available for the holiday season. So keep an eye out.
[8888.10s -> 8893.38s]  Twitter, keep an eye out. Here, keep an eye on the sus to find out what the next stream is going to
[8893.38s -> 8899.24s]  be. I tell you, it's probably going to be on Monday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We'll go three days
[8899.24s -> 8909.30s]  in a row because I've been away for so long. Yeah, thanks for watching. I know that a lot of people
[8909.30s -> 8914.47s]  you put up with a lot of the technical issues kind of in the middle. And thanks for sticking
[8914.47s -> 8918.76s]  around. I know it's really easy to leave a stream like that when there's problems,
[8918.76s -> 8923.93s]  but thanks for sticking with it. And it was an incredible night. It was a really fun day.
[8923.93s -> 8930.41s]  I'm just sad that it's over in a way. I'm sad that it's like all these like kind of new friends
[8930.41s -> 8935.40s]  and acquaintances. It was a great feeling and I'm really happy that it went over well. And I'm
[8935.40s -> 8942.23s]  really happy that people had a good time. So thank you again for watching. Thanks for the support.
[8942.23s -> 8950.20s]  And yeah, we'll see you on the next one. I'll see you guys on Monday. Monday, we're going back to
[8950.20s -> 8957.58s]  regular streaming. So I'll put a poll in the chat of a game. Pac-Man World Remake came out.
[8957.58s -> 8966.42s]  Very important. Pac-Man Remake is out. I think I have to check that out. Cult of the Lamb. I still
[8966.42s -> 8972.71s]  want to play that. Sorcery Part 3. We still have to get through Part 3. There's quite a bit to do.
[8972.71s -> 8983.24s]  I'm a little bit behind. Yeah, Pac-Man World got a remaster of some kind. It's on Steam now.
[8983.24s -> 8992.18s]  Multi Versus. I'm going back to Multi Versus. There's a lot to do. So on Monday, you'll figure
[8992.18s -> 8995.38s]  that out. We'll start at the same time. Two o'clock. I want to get back to this 2 p.m. Pacific
[8995.38s -> 9004.76s]  schedule. And yeah, we'll make a photos command to link to the photo album. Okay, cool. Yeah.
[9004.76s -> 9010.20s]  So that Leather Jackets photo album, this will be available to go check out. It'll be the
[9010.20s -> 9019.96s]  exclamation point photos. But yeah, I'll be back on Monday. 2 p.m. Pacific. Thanks a lot, guys.
[9019.96s -> 9029.24s]  Have a great rest of your day. Great rest of your night. And with that, I'm going to leave it.
[9029.24s -> 9034.07s]  Quick one, but I wanted just to kind of come and catch up. I didn't want to wait too long. I wanted
[9034.07s -> 9047.05s]  to do a little bit of a debrief for the stream, too. Get some more chapstick. I got plenty. I got
[9047.05s -> 9061.29s]  a lot. What about modded Skyrim? Oh yeah, there was. I was going to do the modded Skyrim and use a
[9061.29s -> 9068.38s]  Ghost Commander's tool. Yeah, I just got to get back into the saddle here. I've been in baseball
[9068.38s -> 9073.18s]  mode for the last like two weeks. I just kind of got over it three, two, three days ago. So
[9073.18s -> 9081.54s]  I kind of have to get back into it. Signed baseballs are restocked. German985.com if you
[9081.54s -> 9092.20s]  want one. Keep an eye on it. There might be a second restock available for those non in-game
[9092.20s -> 9100.60s]  but souvenir kind of balls. I think we are probably fresh out of the... I'm imagining we're out of the
[9100.60s -> 9110.46s]  game balls at this point. Justice for Ball Fondler. He didn't do anything wrong. You must have missed
[9110.46s -> 9116.50s]  the memo. Ball Fondler has been unbanned. He got unbanned at the end of this stream. At the end of
[9116.50s -> 9128.92s]  baseball, he was unbanned. Ball Fondler is among us. There's more game balls. I know that when I
[9128.92s -> 9135.05s]  talked to Jake about the merch last, they tracked down some other game balls that were used in the
[9135.05s -> 9138.65s]  game that they didn't have inventory of on the website. So I'll talk to him again. I'll get some
[9138.65s -> 9155.54s]  more answers here. But keep an eye on the site. And with that, I'll see you guys Monday. Take care
[9155.54s -> 9167.96s]  of yourselves. It's good to be back. Have a great night. Have a great day. See you soon. See you real
[9167.96s -> 9174.04s]  Monday. Goodbye. Good night.
