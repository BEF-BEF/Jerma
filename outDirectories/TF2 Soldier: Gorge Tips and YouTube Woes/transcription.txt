[0.31s -> 15.90s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[15.90s -> 21.96s]  and tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the strange rocket launcher, the buff
[21.96s -> 27.96s]  banner, and the escape plan, probably my default setup as the Soldier. And before I get into
[27.96s -> 32.16s]  really anything in this video, I want to talk about something very, very important. It seems
[32.16s -> 37.84s]  like YouTube hates my channel in recent weeks. Half of my videos are not publishing to you
[37.84s -> 43.56s]  guys. I put a tweet out last night asking, hey, are you guys even getting my videos in
[43.56s -> 50.68s]  your sub boxes? And at least 15 people were like, nope. So I guess the only real solution
[50.68s -> 53.80s]  to this, because it's totally out of my hands, guys, I really wish there was something I
[53.80s -> 60.24s]  could do, is if you are not getting my videos in your sub box, I'm just gonna put my recent
[60.24s -> 65.08s]  videos in the description of pretty much all my videos, just so if you happen to catch
[65.08s -> 69.24s]  one of them, you'll be able to go to the description and go and see the ones that you may have
[69.24s -> 74.69s]  missed. Now, that's obviously not the ideal solution. I'd like my channel just to work
[74.69s -> 79.59s]  as intended. But if it's not going to, then that's the only thing I can really think of
[79.59s -> 83.55s]  for a solution. So in the description of this video, there's gonna be a list of three or
[83.55s -> 87.63s]  four videos that you may have missed. And if you already saw them, you don't have to
[87.63s -> 90.95s]  go back and watch them again. It's just these that's just there for the people that may
[90.95s -> 95.07s]  have missed something. So if you go through that list and you say, wait a second, I didn't
[95.07s -> 99.03s]  see this face cam fortress video, what the hell, then go ahead and click on it. And you
[99.03s -> 103.39s]  can go ahead and watch it from there. So again, I am really sorry about this. I wish there
[103.39s -> 109.59s]  was something I could do, but there just there just isn't. I'm at the mercy of YouTube. But
[109.59s -> 114.43s]  enough of that, that that's enough depressing talk for one day. Let's get into the video.
[114.43s -> 118.23s]  Let's talk about the soldier on gorge. I want to give you a couple tips on gorge as
[118.23s -> 122.00s]  soldier. So the first thing I want to talk about is this right balcony. And most of these
[122.00s -> 126.04s]  things are going to be on defense, not very many offensive tips for you right now, because
[126.04s -> 130.24s]  obviously I'm playing on defense. But if you saw right there, when I jumped up on this
[130.24s -> 135.68s]  right side, I totally negated the rocket jump because there was a small health pack sitting
[135.68s -> 139.88s]  right here. Now, anytime you jump up here, you're never gonna have to worry about losing
[139.88s -> 144.04s]  health on your rocket jump. And oh, I'm gonna have like 40 50 less health. Oh, that's not
[144.08s -> 148.08s]  good. You don't have to worry about that, because you will get that every single time.
[148.36s -> 153.52s]  Unless this is a big unless unless there is a teleporter sitting right here, and there's
[153.52s -> 158.50s]  nine people up here all pushing the point, then this is not the best route to go. But
[158.50s -> 162.46s]  if you see in this gameplay, there's very few people up here, there's only one sniper or
[162.46s -> 167.14s]  one pyro will be up here at any given time. So this is a fantastic way to wrap around.
[167.30s -> 170.58s]  And that's what you want to try and do here. When you get up here, when you finally go
[170.62s -> 174.42s]  around and you kill a couple people, you are going to have a bird's eye view perfect for
[174.42s -> 179.22s]  soldier, you're going to be on high ground over everybody, which allows you to jump down
[179.22s -> 183.22s]  if you want, try and do some crazy tactics, try and do a super shot. I don't even know
[183.22s -> 187.78s]  what a super shot is. But it gives you a lot of options to play around as the soldier.
[188.02s -> 192.54s]  And speaking of just gorge in general, there's a lot of these little balconies, there's a
[192.54s -> 196.70s]  lot of these little side balconies, even on the first point, the second point, all in
[196.70s -> 201.03s]  between, there's a lot of places for you to jump. And I don't mean jump around like
[201.07s -> 205.75s]  star, where star jumps around like crazy and gets like 90 kills by jumping off walls and
[205.75s -> 210.91s]  going around. I'm talking just regular, here's a balcony and dares to jump, I jumped up
[210.91s -> 215.31s]  to the balcony. That's my type of rocket jump. That's my, I can't really do that crazy,
[215.31s -> 219.51s]  awesome stuff. But there's a lot of these on gorge, a lot of these small balconies,
[219.51s -> 223.63s]  small cubbies. And it kind of reminds me of a place like gravel pit, where gravel pit
[223.63s -> 228.15s]  has a couple of small jumps that take you to really, really important places. But only
[228.15s -> 232.87s]  a couple classes can even get there. People like the scout, the pyro, the soldier and
[232.87s -> 236.51s]  the demo man are the only ones, well, I guess the medic now has an opportunity if he uses
[236.51s -> 241.11s]  the quick fix. But they're the only ones with the opportunities to move higher than a normal
[241.11s -> 246.41s]  jump at any given second. And I really love maps in this game that allow certain opportunities
[246.41s -> 250.35s]  for different classes. I'm not a big fan of maps where you just kind of pit one team
[250.35s -> 254.31s]  against the other team. And you just smash together in the middle and that's it. It's
[254.31s -> 258.63s]  just like a big mess of people in one spot. I like when there's multiple options. I like
[258.63s -> 263.43s]  when there's a lot of strategy involved. Strategy on a very basic level, not strategy like,
[263.43s -> 266.71s]  okay, we got to have two scouts over that way. We got to have four medics go that way,
[266.71s -> 269.75s]  four medic, that's a lot of people. But you know what I mean? I like when things have just
[269.75s -> 275.62s]  general diversity. I like when things are allowed to be done a million different ways. And that's
[275.62s -> 279.90s]  why I love Team Fortress. There's a million different ways to play this game. You could
[279.90s -> 283.66s]  come on and play this game tonight and then play it tomorrow and do something completely
[283.66s -> 288.14s]  different and you might even learn something. I'm still learning things in this game and
[288.14s -> 292.66s]  I've been playing since the beta. That's how ridiculous this game really is. But enough
[292.66s -> 296.54s]  about my love for Team Fortress, let's get back to the Soldier and talk about another
[296.54s -> 302.06s]  chip that you could do on Gravel Pit. I mean Gorge. So on Gravel, I almost just did it
[302.06s -> 308.98s]  again. On Gorge, G-O-R-G-E on defense, you're going to notice that the blue team after capping
[308.98s -> 313.82s]  the first point only has one spawn door to come out of. And look where it is. It's up
[313.82s -> 318.14s]  on a high rise. So if you can wrap around as the Soldier here, get around, kill a couple
[318.14s -> 324.30s]  people, you will cause so much fear and so much chaos because you can jump up here in
[324.30s -> 327.86s]  front of their spawn door. Now I do it once and I jump right back down, but look at all
[327.86s -> 331.94s]  these people that are like, just running away from me because they are so scared. That's
[331.94s -> 336.06s]  what you want to try and do. I mean, you don't want to try and do this, make this kind of
[336.06s -> 340.74s]  a little side mission if you end up doing it. But once you do get back here, just look
[340.74s -> 344.86s]  at all these people that are in a freak out mode right now. All of them are just thinking,
[344.86s -> 348.62s]  get this guy out of here. Can we get somebody to kill this Soldier? Can we get him out of
[348.62s -> 353.20s]  here? Throw him in the dungeon for crying out loud. That will be going through my head.
[353.20s -> 356.90s]  So it's good to cause some chaos every now and then. Good to freak the other team out.
[356.90s -> 361.10s]  So then they're looking for you again. Because if you get away, that's the number one thing.
[361.10s -> 364.34s]  If you can get away after doing this, you are going to make so many people coming out
[364.34s -> 368.22s]  of the spawn. Just look left, look, where is that? Is that Soldier here? Kind of the
[368.22s -> 374.13s]  same theory if you were a spy, I guess. But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[374.13s -> 377.49s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And again, there's going
[377.49s -> 381.33s]  to be a list of three or four videos in the description that you may have missed because
[381.33s -> 386.07s]  sub boxes are being really messed up and crazy. So if you want to go check those videos out,
[386.07s -> 390.17s]  they will be there. And every single video I make from now on is going to have the last
[390.53s -> 395.53s]  three or four videos in the description. I'm going to do this for as long as... Until this
[395.53s -> 399.45s]  is all fixed, I'm going to be doing it for that long. So thank you guys again for watching
[399.45s -> 402.93s]  so much. I'll see you guys all soon. And take care, everybody.
