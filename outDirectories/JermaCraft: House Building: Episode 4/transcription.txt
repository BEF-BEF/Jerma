[1.27s -> 7.93s]  Alright, well I literally can't afford to lose all that stuff, so I have to go get it.
[7.93s -> 10.43s]  Where was that piece of crap? There it was.
[10.43s -> 16.11s]  Okay, we're good. We're good. No harm, no foul.
[16.11s -> 27.08s]  I got it. Come on, give me this. Let's get out of here.
[27.08s -> 30.34s]  This house is a travesty.
[30.34s -> 34.90s]  First of all, I need to make... I need to make a furnace.
[34.90s -> 43.57s]  Furnace is done. And I got... okay.
[43.57s -> 50.12s]  I gotta put the furnace down. Let's get some iron.
[50.12s -> 52.12s]  I can take this and put it here.
[57.60s -> 61.67s]  So you make multiple furnaces. That's what I like to do.
[61.67s -> 64.67s]  Whenever I play this pro game that I'm a pro at.
[64.67s -> 71.26s]  Let's get multiple furnaces going, burning mad stuff.
[71.26s -> 78.86s]  I at least want to get this closed off so it's not a completely open area.
[78.86s -> 84.64s]  There we are. Get me on top.
[84.64s -> 88.64s]  And I want to make rooms. You know, it's gonna be quite the challenge.
[88.64s -> 91.52s]  But I'm up for the challenge.
[91.52s -> 94.21s]  Because this is JermaCraft, baby.
[94.21s -> 98.34s]  As long as it matches. What is it, three up?
[98.34s -> 99.34s]  Something like that.
[99.34s -> 104.08s]  Look at that hole. That's an instant death waiting to happen.
[104.08s -> 108.43s]  I can't reach down there.
[108.43s -> 113.13s]  Gotta make the climb. Start putting some torches down.
[113.13s -> 115.43s]  Those things still brewing?
[115.43s -> 120.49s]  Alright, castle mode activate.
[120.49s -> 127.31s]  Do I have any other... I don't have any of the materials, do I?
[127.31s -> 131.64s]  Alright. Starting to come together a little.
[131.64s -> 138.42s]  Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[138.42s -> 143.53s]  Alright. What do I got for iron?
[143.53s -> 147.41s]  Ow. Six bars.
[147.41s -> 149.84s]  Seventeen bars of iron.
[149.84s -> 152.55s]  Get the coal back.
[152.55s -> 154.79s]  Let's make some armor.
[154.79s -> 156.79s]  Because I really need it really badly.
[156.79s -> 159.67s]  Let's go with a helmet.
[159.67s -> 163.36s]  And I think I got... I want to get a chest piece.
[163.36s -> 167.60s]  Chest piece is like this, right? Yep.
[167.60s -> 168.90s]  Chest piece.
[168.90s -> 171.21s]  I want to make sure I get an iron pick.
[171.21s -> 173.21s]  Because that's really important right now.
[173.21s -> 176.60s]  And I want an iron shovel as well.
[176.60s -> 180.95s]  And... nice.
[180.95s -> 183.90s]  Alright. I'm looking for diamonds.
[183.90s -> 189.53s]  You know what I haven't seen anything of yet?
[189.53s -> 191.53s]  I haven't seen any endermen.
[191.53s -> 196.02s]  And people were telling me, oh well Jerma, if you see an enderman, don't look at it.
[196.02s -> 200.02s]  If you look at an enderman right in the face, it just starts attacking you or something.
[200.02s -> 203.20s]  So you're not supposed to make direct eye contact with them.
[203.20s -> 205.44s]  Which that's pretty damn terrifying.
[205.44s -> 211.26s]  If I can think of one very scary thing, it's to... it's like Medusa.
[211.26s -> 214.39s]  Don't look at him or he'll just murder you.
[214.39s -> 216.63s]  So they must be passive.
[216.63s -> 218.63s]  They must be... hello iron.
[218.63s -> 220.63s]  They must be passive.
[220.63s -> 222.63s]  Unless you look at them I guess.
[222.63s -> 224.63s]  They kind of just walk around.
[224.63s -> 227.83s]  I don't know. That's scary.
[227.83s -> 230.07s]  How many irons?
[230.07s -> 232.07s]  Only one.
[232.07s -> 235.59s]  Oh come on.
[235.59s -> 237.59s]  You're killing me.
[237.59s -> 239.59s]  I can't wait for my first enderman experience.
[239.59s -> 242.92s]  I'm probably going to crap my pants.
[242.92s -> 245.93s]  So let's get my house built more.
[245.93s -> 247.93s]  Because I want to make sure I can close this off.
[247.93s -> 250.74s]  I don't want to have to deal with this anymore.
[250.74s -> 252.74s]  I need to get a bed too. This is bad.
[252.74s -> 256.44s]  That's good enough.
[256.44s -> 258.87s]  So speaking of building houses.
[258.87s -> 261.62s]  I got a little mini story for you.
[261.62s -> 264.38s]  I guess while I close this up.
[264.38s -> 267.19s]  So my sister, my sister used to go.
[267.19s -> 270.33s]  Well not used to. When she was younger.
[270.33s -> 272.33s]  She was in some kind of like Peace Corps thing.
[272.33s -> 274.33s]  Not really Peace Corps.
[274.33s -> 276.70s]  But she went to the Dominican Republic.
[276.70s -> 278.70s]  To build houses for the very needy.
[278.70s -> 281.06s]  And the people that have no houses.
[281.06s -> 283.06s]  No any shelter really at all.
[283.06s -> 285.37s]  And she kind of used to go do this.
[285.37s -> 287.74s]  She used to go to the Dominican.
[287.74s -> 289.74s]  She'd fly down there.
[289.74s -> 292.49s]  This is when she was I think in high school.
[292.49s -> 294.49s]  She was only like 17 or so when she did this.
[294.49s -> 297.11s]  Which is pretty crazy.
[297.11s -> 299.67s]  And she used to go build houses for people.
[299.67s -> 301.67s]  Well I can't really call them houses.
[301.67s -> 303.67s]  Because obviously if you don't have an architectural degree.
[303.67s -> 305.85s]  You can't really build a house.
[305.85s -> 307.85s]  But every time I do this I think about my sister.
[307.85s -> 310.41s]  Building something like this.
[310.41s -> 312.41s]  Just making a small hut.
[312.41s -> 315.03s]  Just a small you know living space.
[315.03s -> 317.53s]  And it makes me smile.
[317.53s -> 319.96s]  Because my sister is really cool.
[319.96s -> 321.96s]  If you saw the latest grandpa video.
[321.96s -> 324.14s]  You already know who my sister is.
[324.14s -> 327.02s]  Because she had a cameo.
[327.02s -> 329.02s]  She was the granddaughter I guess.
[329.02s -> 332.02s]  In episode 3.
[332.02s -> 334.52s]  And yeah she's cool.
[334.52s -> 337.02s]  That story can lead into another story.
[337.02s -> 339.45s]  I have two siblings.
[339.45s -> 342.01s]  If those of you who are wondering.
[342.01s -> 344.50s]  They're both older.
[344.50s -> 346.50s]  Brother and a sister.
[346.50s -> 348.50s]  I'm 26.
[348.50s -> 350.81s]  Which makes us pretty much.
[350.81s -> 353.88s]  We're all pretty much a year and a half apart.
[353.88s -> 355.88s]  And it's pretty interesting living a life.
[355.88s -> 358.12s]  I'm the youngest. I'm the baby.
[358.12s -> 361.26s]  Say your jokes. Go ahead say your jokes.
[361.26s -> 363.82s]  But it's good being the baby.
[363.82s -> 365.82s]  The baby always gets like what he wants.
[365.82s -> 369.78s]  I need to make legs.
[369.78s -> 372.60s]  Do I have enough legs?
[372.60s -> 374.60s]  I don't think I do.
[374.60s -> 377.16s]  And I'm probably doing it wrong.
[377.16s -> 379.16s]  No I do. Nice.
[379.16s -> 381.78s]  So I have a full set of armor on now.
[381.78s -> 383.78s]  At least not as easy as it was before.
[383.78s -> 386.47s]  Full set of armor.
[386.47s -> 388.47s]  Let me know in the comments guys.
[388.47s -> 390.47s]  If you have a brother or sister or something.
[390.47s -> 392.78s]  Let me know how things are going with them.
[392.78s -> 395.46s]  Because if you're not close with your brothers and sisters.
[395.46s -> 397.64s]  You should be.
[397.64s -> 399.64s]  You really should be.
[399.64s -> 401.64s]  Because when all S hits the fan.
[401.64s -> 403.64s]  When things really go down.
[403.64s -> 405.88s]  Your family really is the only thing that's really totally there for you.
[405.88s -> 407.88s]  At all times.
[407.88s -> 410.50s]  At any given moment.
[410.50s -> 412.50s]  So if you're having problems with your siblings or something like that.
[412.50s -> 414.50s]  Just always remember that.
[414.50s -> 418.79s]  Really important.
[418.79s -> 420.79s]  So let me know.
[420.79s -> 422.79s]  I like to hear about that type of stuff.
[422.79s -> 426.50s]  It interests me.
[426.50s -> 429.83s]  Trying to make this all level here.
[429.83s -> 432.65s]  So the roof. I can essentially extend the roof.
[432.65s -> 434.65s]  By not building anymore.
[434.65s -> 437.66s]  And kind of just dig down.
[437.66s -> 442.58s]  With my new beautiful iron shovel.
[442.58s -> 444.58s]  I need to make a.
[444.58s -> 450.22s]  I gotta get more wood.
[450.22s -> 452.97s]  Look at this. They're just kind of floating in space.
[452.97s -> 455.98s]  I'll move them.
[455.98s -> 459.18s]  I will move them.
[459.18s -> 465.96s]  Oh will you stop it already.
[465.96s -> 468.97s]  How's that look?
[468.97s -> 471.72s]  Close this off.
[471.72s -> 473.72s]  I gotta make. Oh my god.
[473.72s -> 475.90s]  Remember like five minutes ago.
[475.90s -> 479.10s]  When I said that that was going to happen.
[479.10s -> 481.10s]  I even said it.
[481.10s -> 484.22s]  I just scared the crap out of myself.
[484.22s -> 487.86s]  By doing that.
[487.86s -> 490.30s]  Okay. Okay. Alright.
[490.30s -> 492.30s]  Make a little bit of a doorway into this room.
[492.30s -> 495.18s]  This is going to be the bedroom.
[495.18s -> 497.18s]  This is going to be the sleeping quarters.
[497.18s -> 501.66s]  Because that's not going to be cool.
[501.66s -> 504.54s]  Alright. I gotta fix this room.
[504.54s -> 507.10s]  A lot of stuff I gotta fix.
[507.10s -> 509.27s]  But as of right now. See you kind of turn the corner.
[509.27s -> 512.41s]  Right here.
[512.41s -> 515.42s]  Clean this up a little right here.
[515.42s -> 518.23s]  Alright. Awesome.
