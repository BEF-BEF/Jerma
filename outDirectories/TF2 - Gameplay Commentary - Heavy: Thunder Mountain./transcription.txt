[0.82s -> 9.13s]  What is happening guys, it is Jerma bringing you a complete fucking roll video as a heavy.
[9.13s -> 15.13s]  I'm using the default minigun, the sandwich, and the gloves are running urgently.
[15.13s -> 21.13s]  And I left it with a little bit of setup time so I could just say a couple things to you guys.
[21.13s -> 29.13s]  I want to thank most of the subscribers, I think there's 12 of you now that have subscribed to me in the very beginning of this run I'm doing here.
[29.13s -> 34.13s]  It really means a lot to me, I thank you guys a lot from the bottom of my heart.
[34.13s -> 41.13s]  And I'll be doing probably some type of giveaway, some type of subscription giveaway for people or something like that.
[41.13s -> 47.13s]  Something to show my gratitude and get more people to come to the channel and have a little bit more of an advertising thing.
[47.13s -> 51.13s]  But it's three seconds left, this is a complete roll.
[51.13s -> 58.13s]  I'm not going to really give too much gameplay commentary because it's a complete roll, we destroy this team with no regard.
[58.13s -> 63.13s]  I get ubered right out of the gate, there's a sentry on the right, kill the sentry, kill the engineer.
[63.13s -> 67.13s]  Kill this guy over here, no actually I don't kill anybody, we get on the cart.
[67.13s -> 73.13s]  And like I said in a video before, rolling people is stupid, I hate it.
[73.13s -> 76.13s]  I wish it would never happen, but it does.
[76.13s -> 81.13s]  This sentry gun is distracted by something over on the left, I end up taking it out very very easily.
[81.13s -> 84.13s]  Keep moving up here, there's a demo man I think up there.
[84.13s -> 89.13s]  Get rid of this engineer's equipment because that's just a slap in the face.
[89.13s -> 91.13s]  Get back on the cart.
[91.13s -> 94.13s]  We are absolutely rolling to the point.
[94.13s -> 97.13s]  This scout, I didn't think I was going to kill him, he was running around like a little bunny.
[97.13s -> 99.13s]  Kill him anyways.
[99.13s -> 101.13s]  And we are still rolling.
[101.13s -> 103.13s]  These type of games just annoy me.
[103.13s -> 107.13s]  Well it's hard to say that when I'm playing cart heavy.
[107.13s -> 110.13s]  That pyro just disappeared by the way.
[110.13s -> 113.13s]  He jumped up and sprayed everybody.
[113.13s -> 116.13s]  And then was launched 100 feet in the air and he was just gone from there.
[116.13s -> 119.13s]  This spy backstabbed somebody on my team, I kill him.
[119.13s -> 121.13s]  Still on the cart, we are at the second point.
[121.13s -> 123.13s]  And this is a big tip for you guys right here.
[123.13s -> 126.13s]  When you cap this point, watch what I do.
[126.13s -> 130.13s]  I don't wait for the bridge to come up like everybody does.
[130.13s -> 132.13s]  You don't have to wait for that bridge to come up.
[132.13s -> 134.13s]  Just run around the side like I'm doing here.
[134.13s -> 139.13s]  And you'll get people off guard coming through this house like I get this medic off guard.
[139.13s -> 142.13s]  I'm not sure I actually kill him, but I get this sentry off guard.
[142.13s -> 144.13s]  There's pretty much this whole team over here off guard.
[144.13s -> 147.13s]  I think I'm going to die, I run back, throw my sandwich in the ground.
[147.13s -> 151.13s]  But the point is, use that little route on the left.
[151.13s -> 155.13s]  You don't have to wait for the bridge just sitting there waiting like 30 seconds for the bridge to come up.
[155.13s -> 157.13s]  You don't have to do that.
[157.13s -> 160.13s]  I get ubered again, come up here, there's another sentry over here.
[160.13s -> 163.13s]  This makes it four I think for me of kills for me.
[163.13s -> 166.13s]  Take out the engineer, take out the heavy.
[166.13s -> 169.13s]  And people start to leave the cart at this point.
[169.13s -> 171.13s]  Nobody's pushing the cart.
[171.13s -> 176.13s]  Everyone's kind of just sitting back and as you can see the cart just has one or two people on it.
[176.13s -> 179.13s]  And I believe I say over Mike, I say something like,
[179.13s -> 181.13s]  Can we push the cart?
[181.13s -> 185.13s]  What are we doing? Let's just get it over with.
[185.13s -> 187.13s]  So we all get on it.
[187.13s -> 189.13s]  And this is an absolute roll like I said.
[189.13s -> 191.13s]  It's a very quick gameplay.
[191.13s -> 195.13s]  But if this happens, if you see this happen in the server,
[195.13s -> 197.13s]  Please switch to the other team.
[197.13s -> 200.13s]  If you're number one, number two on the server,
[200.13s -> 203.13s]  Switch to the other team. Don't be a dick.
[203.13s -> 206.13s]  Switch to the other team, make it fun for everybody.
[206.13s -> 209.13s]  There's no reason to do this at all, ever.
[209.13s -> 212.13s]  But anyways, thank you guys, all the subscribers again.
[212.13s -> 215.13s]  I appreciate all you guys do. Thank you so much.
[215.13s -> 217.13s]  I'm out.
