[0.31s -> 10.97s]  To the left, to the right, to the behind.
[10.97s -> 12.97s]  Oh dude, I got killed by a parachuting man.
[12.97s -> 14.97s]  Wow, that guy just got destroyed.
[14.97s -> 16.97s]  Oh my god, there's people everywhere.
[16.97s -> 18.97s]  I don't even know. Guy that just parachuted in.
[18.97s -> 20.97s]  Didn't kill him.
[20.97s -> 22.97s]  It's okay. I'm pinned down here.
[22.97s -> 24.97s]  I'm pinned down here.
[24.97s -> 27.21s]  What killed me?
[27.21s -> 29.21s]  You're telling me that some motherfucker on the roof just killed me?
[29.21s -> 31.21s]  Somebody on the roof.
[31.21s -> 33.21s]  Except for Vibe, yes. No, I'm dead again.
[33.21s -> 35.21s]  He shot me again from the same spot.
[35.21s -> 37.21s]  He's up on the roof, he's like on the corner.
[37.21s -> 39.21s]  He's like fucking Spider-Man.
[39.21s -> 41.21s]  Get rid of that guy.
[41.21s -> 43.21s]  I don't know what corner you're talking about.
[43.21s -> 45.21s]  He's on like the roof of the building, like one of the highest buildings.
[45.21s -> 47.21s]  Spawn on me, then shoot at him.
[47.21s -> 49.21s]  Alright, fine. Spawning on you, shooting at Spider-Man.
[49.21s -> 51.90s]  Confirm Spider-Man, get him.
[51.90s -> 53.90s]  We're never gonna hit this guy.
[53.90s -> 55.90s]  Dude, this is the one time I spawned without a sniper rifle.
[55.90s -> 59.93s]  And I just got...
[59.93s -> 63.93s]  Oh, it was a long storm on that one fateful day.
[63.93s -> 68.30s]  Did I ever tell thee the story of me old bones?
[68.30s -> 70.30s]  Do we keep going under the water?
[70.30s -> 72.98s]  Yeah, we do.
[72.98s -> 78.55s]  Let me tell you the story of me old bones.
[78.55s -> 80.55s]  There was a time in a pirate's life.
[80.55s -> 84.55s]  When we didn't have such old bones.
[84.55s -> 87.24s]  And that time, well you ran out of bullets, didn't you?
[87.24s -> 96.39s]  So, are we defending this?
[96.39s -> 99.85s]  Okay.
[99.85s -> 102.41s]  The house just...
[102.41s -> 104.41s]  I did that.
[104.41s -> 106.41s]  Did you seriously just do that?
[106.41s -> 110.84s]  I spent the last minute looking for a spawn beacon that was placed there.
[110.84s -> 112.84s]  Couldn't find it.
[112.84s -> 114.84s]  Honestly, I didn't even know what just happened.
[114.84s -> 116.84s]  I felt like somebody just put a flash in my face.
[116.84s -> 120.84s]  And I teleported to the past.
[120.84s -> 125.64s]  How do I get a better view?
[125.64s -> 127.64s]  I don't know.
[127.64s -> 129.64s]  I need a better view of this.
[129.64s -> 131.64s]  I fucking jumped out.
[131.64s -> 133.64s]  I swear to God, dude.
[133.64s -> 135.64s]  Why am I floating?
[135.64s -> 137.64s]  I'm flying into the air.
[137.64s -> 139.88s]  I'm going to heaven.
[139.88s -> 144.42s]  I'm going to heaven. God has chosen me.
[144.42s -> 148.92s]  Let me tell you the story of me old bones.
[148.92s -> 150.92s]  Did you just never tell the story?
[150.92s -> 152.92s]  You just keep saying it.
[152.92s -> 154.92s]  Let me tell you an old story of me old bones.
[154.92s -> 156.92s]  I want to hear the story.
[156.92s -> 163.10s]  One time me old bones shot twelve people in one second.
[163.10s -> 165.10s]  Like you just saw right there.
[165.10s -> 169.53s]  And then me old bones were buried.
[169.53s -> 172.09s]  In the graveyard.
[172.09s -> 176.46s]  Behind your old bones.
[176.46s -> 180.46s]  Once again, I guess we're going to have another German video where you don't even play the game.
[180.46s -> 183.34s]  I'm kicking ass right now.
[183.34s -> 185.34s]  And your bones, whatever.
[185.34s -> 187.34s]  And then he turned the corner.
[187.34s -> 189.34s]  And he shot some more old bones.
[189.34s -> 191.83s]  And he got another kill.
[191.83s -> 194.97s]  And then another boat came over.
[194.97s -> 198.97s]  And he killed all their bones as well.
[198.97s -> 200.97s]  And blew up the fucking boat.
[200.97s -> 204.81s]  See how I was seven and ten?
[204.81s -> 211.30s]  I got my only seven kills in that fifteen to thirty seconds when I was doing the old bones thing at the end.
[211.30s -> 213.30s]  You were doing it for like eight minutes.
[213.30s -> 219.96s]  Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
[219.96s -> 223.96s]  You just like stumped your balls in my face.
[223.96s -> 225.96s]  Blub blub blub blub.
[225.96s -> 227.96s]  You see what I mean?
[227.96s -> 229.96s]  Yeah, you just did.
[229.96s -> 231.96s]  Did I just drown?
[231.96s -> 233.96s]  No, I didn't.
[233.96s -> 236.14s]  No, I just want to go swimming.
[236.14s -> 238.14s]  I just want to go swimming in grandma's lake.
[238.14s -> 240.70s]  No!
[240.70s -> 242.70s]  Grandma's lake, the ocean you mean?
[242.70s -> 244.70s]  No, grandma's lake. She's a rich bitch.
[244.70s -> 250.84s]  What am I supposed to be even shooting here?
[250.84s -> 256.17s]  Please don't drive us into like the dish from Cable Guy.
[256.17s -> 260.54s]  No, this is the ending scene from 007, Goldeneye.
[260.54s -> 262.54s]  Ah, this is the ending scene from Cable Guy as well.
[262.54s -> 266.54s]  Who's this dude with a blowtorch?
[266.54s -> 269.48s]  Some guy, something tells me buddy.
[269.48s -> 271.48s]  You're not going to hit anybody with a blowtorch.
[271.48s -> 273.48s]  What are you doing? Stop spinning around in circles.
[273.48s -> 277.48s]  You're seriously fucking up my screen.
[277.48s -> 279.48s]  I'm out. See you later.
[279.48s -> 283.06s]  Goodbye.
[283.06s -> 285.06s]  Look up in the air at me.
[285.06s -> 287.06s]  What are you doing?
[287.06s -> 292.70s]  What are you doing?
[292.70s -> 296.15s]  You spin around in circles.
[296.15s -> 298.15s]  Blowtorch man, like trying to clean somebody's teeth.
[298.15s -> 303.34s]  Alright, let's go.
[303.34s -> 305.51s]  Deploy.
[305.51s -> 307.51s]  There he is, there he is.
[307.51s -> 309.82s]  Gotta land on the building and do the bros.
[309.82s -> 315.21s]  I'm not even close to landing on that building.
[315.21s -> 317.96s]  I'm like falling straight down.
[317.96s -> 321.35s]  Battlefield bros.
[321.35s -> 326.20s]  You just came out of the ground.
[326.20s -> 332.22s]  Now that we're in a plane.
[332.22s -> 334.22s]  I might as well tell you the story.
[334.22s -> 336.71s]  Of me old boys.
[336.71s -> 341.85s]  It was a dark and dreary night.
[341.85s -> 345.85s]  And me old boys were fucking on fire.
[345.85s -> 349.30s]  Sure, he's still alive.
[349.30s -> 353.66s]  That makes perfect sense.
[353.66s -> 356.34s]  I'm going.
[356.34s -> 364.66s]  This guy lying on the ground right here.
[364.66s -> 366.66s]  Why is this working?
[366.66s -> 368.66s]  I can't even see man.
[368.66s -> 370.66s]  You are messing up my camera.
[370.66s -> 372.66s]  It's trying to fix my camera.
[372.66s -> 376.66s]  My character is stuck in the I'm crawling forward animation.
[376.66s -> 379.10s]  I fell off.
[379.10s -> 382.87s]  Let me tell you a story about me old boys.
[382.87s -> 384.87s]  Let me tell you a story about me old boys.
