[0.31s -> 14.82s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here, and Ster, and I don't see Steph. What the hell was that?
[14.82s -> 16.82s]  Hi.
[16.82s -> 18.82s]  That was like a Chewbacca growl.
[18.82s -> 22.02s]  I wanted to announce my presence.
[22.02s -> 25.32s]  That's a great way to do it. I approve of that.
[25.32s -> 32.94s]  But we're playing the Wave 666 for the Man vs. Machine thing. Probably going to get stomped right now.
[32.94s -> 35.94s]  But you know what? It's only good fun. We'll see how far we can get, baby.
[35.94s -> 38.89s]  So let's ready up. Who are we waiting on?
[38.89s -> 39.89s]  I'm not ready.
[39.89s -> 41.75s]  Where are you?
[41.75s -> 48.87s]  I'm Chewbacca-ing in spawn. I've never played Engineer before. I need to figure out what the Engi do.
[48.87s -> 51.56s]  What does the Engineer even do? How do you play?
[51.56s -> 55.99s]  I don't know. I think he builds Sentries and they just shoot at everything.
[55.99s -> 57.99s]  I've never played this class.
[57.99s -> 64.11s]  Well we have 20 seconds before. Oh goodness. We lost a player.
[64.11s -> 68.29s]  Oh yay! That sucks.
[68.29s -> 72.96s]  Well here we go. Here we go. We lost a guy.
[72.96s -> 74.96s]  I'm coming. I'm coming.
[74.96s -> 76.96s]  Oh stop. You gotta get over it.
[76.96s -> 78.96s]  I haven't even made it. Oh this is...
[78.96s -> 81.33s]  Hold on. I'm wiggling.
[81.33s -> 84.33s]  The first few are pretty easy. You can kill them while I pretend I'm sitting.
[84.33s -> 86.33s]  Is this only one wave or are there 600 waves?
[86.33s -> 89.33s]  No, there's one wave. 600 waves?
[89.33s -> 98.26s]  Oh my goodness. Why are they holding down the flamethrower? Is there a reason for that?
[98.26s -> 101.02s]  Hey Star!
[101.02s -> 103.64s]  Say that you die.
[103.64s -> 108.22s]  I'm lagging so bad but there's so many crits everywhere.
[108.22s -> 109.22s]  Oh wow.
[109.22s -> 111.22s]  Oh are they coming up the stairs?
[111.22s -> 113.66s]  Look how tall these guys are.
[113.66s -> 116.66s]  Get out of my face. Beggars bazooka baby.
[116.66s -> 119.73s]  So how bad did we lose? Oh!
[119.73s -> 121.97s]  I have a Sentry.
[121.97s -> 127.73s]  Give me the money. How come I can't see you guys on my screen?
[129.67s -> 134.98s]  My HUD exploded.
[134.98s -> 136.98s]  This is super lag.
[136.98s -> 138.98s]  We're winning.
[138.98s -> 141.98s]  This round is almost over. Look at the top.
[141.98s -> 144.35s]  Yeah, the round is almost over.
[144.35s -> 147.10s]  And there's 600 more.
[147.10s -> 150.10s]  You better collect all the gold. The monies.
[150.10s -> 152.10s]  I can't even see these bears.
[152.10s -> 158.55s]  What do you do when you run out of ammo?
[158.55s -> 160.55s]  Am I a dispenser?
[160.55s -> 162.55s]  Oh no, I gotta get... Oh no.
[162.55s -> 166.55s]  Go, go, go, go. I'm not gonna let go of this until I get some ammo.
[166.55s -> 170.57s]  There it is.
[170.57s -> 172.57s]  All these demo men are dead right now.
[172.57s -> 174.57s]  I don't know what a Wrangler is or what it do.
[175.57s -> 177.57s]  What it do, what it do.
[177.57s -> 179.74s]  Look how good we're winning.
[179.74s -> 181.98s]  We're actually not doing that bad.
[181.98s -> 184.98s]  But of course, this is the first 30 seconds.
[184.98s -> 186.98s]  Well, I didn't think we'd get past 30 seconds.
[186.98s -> 188.98s]  Oh no, they have the bomb.
[188.98s -> 190.98s]  I got enough money to buy some.
[193.53s -> 195.53s]  Should I not be doing that?
[195.53s -> 198.53s]  If you buy anything, it should be crit boosts.
[201.41s -> 203.41s]  Oh, a Sentry Buster. Cool.
[203.41s -> 205.41s]  Right here, here we go.
[205.41s -> 207.41s]  I've never seen a Sentry Buster before.
[207.41s -> 209.41s]  But what it do, what it do.
[209.41s -> 211.90s]  Look at these guys.
[211.90s -> 213.90s]  Oh no, Sentry Buster did it.
[213.90s -> 215.90s]  Oh, that Sentry Buster has health, doesn't it?
[215.90s -> 217.90s]  Holy cow. Quite a bit of that health too.
[219.90s -> 221.90s]  I'm sorry about you, Buster.
[221.90s -> 223.90s]  Oh, my Sentry's fine.
[223.90s -> 225.90s]  So many crits.
[225.90s -> 227.90s]  That hurt so much.
[227.90s -> 234.08s]  I mean, man, the problem with this thing is you need so much ammo.
[234.08s -> 238.08s]  I'm not even 10%, not even 5% done with this wave.
[238.08s -> 239.08s]  Oh dear.
[239.08s -> 242.02s]  Holy crap.
[242.02s -> 243.02s]  All right, we're good.
[243.02s -> 247.70s]  Wait till they drop, wait till they drop.
[247.70s -> 251.45s]  And look at this, look at this flare gun.
[251.45s -> 253.45s]  Crits, crits, oh my god.
[253.45s -> 255.69s]  You should reflect those.
[256.69s -> 259.69s]  With your gun, your primary action slot item.
[259.69s -> 261.69s]  This is ridiculous.
[261.69s -> 264.44s]  Right click on it.
[264.44s -> 267.06s]  This is ridiculous.
[267.06s -> 270.06s]  I just respawned and came down the aisle and saw all this.
[270.06s -> 272.06s]  Oh my god, I'm dead.
[272.06s -> 274.06s]  We're so dead.
[279.12s -> 281.12s]  Watch out for those things trying to backstab you.
[281.12s -> 283.12s]  I'm scared now.
[283.12s -> 285.12s]  Just god, I need to get back.
[285.12s -> 287.12s]  Oh no.
[287.12s -> 289.42s]  Delete this.
[289.42s -> 292.75s]  I don't even know, let's go.
[292.75s -> 294.75s]  Come on, crit boost, crit boost.
[294.75s -> 298.46s]  Wow, they have so much health.
[298.46s -> 300.46s]  They're never ever ever ever dying.
[300.46s -> 302.46s]  Oh no.
[302.46s -> 305.98s]  If you shoot with your gun, maybe they'll die.
[305.98s -> 309.18s]  Oh no, no, no.
[311.62s -> 312.62s]  I'm dead.
[312.62s -> 314.62s]  Spam, spam the crits.
[314.62s -> 316.62s]  I hope you guys enjoyed the video.
[316.62s -> 318.62s]  No, we haven't lost yet.
[318.62s -> 320.86s]  You gotta have a good mindset.
[320.86s -> 325.02s]  There are so many dudes up there.
[325.02s -> 327.02s]  This is ridiculous.
[327.02s -> 329.02s]  I'm not even allowed to walk out of spawn.
[329.02s -> 331.02s]  I don't think they're dudes.
[332.02s -> 339.57s]  This is impossible.
[339.57s -> 342.60s]  They have so much health.
[342.60s -> 344.60s]  That's basically infinite.
[344.60s -> 346.03s]  We're alright.
[346.03s -> 349.49s]  We're okay.
[349.49s -> 351.49s]  The bomb will reset.
[351.49s -> 353.49s]  You can see it's in the intelligence in this one.
[353.49s -> 355.49s]  It's on the ground for a while, it goes back.
[355.49s -> 359.71s]  Damn.
[359.71s -> 361.89s]  Why can I not...there we go.
[361.89s -> 362.89s]  Moving my sentry up.
[362.89s -> 365.96s]  Did we win yet?
[365.96s -> 368.96s]  Judging by the wave indicator.
[368.96s -> 372.65s]  Now, we're getting doodled.
[372.65s -> 380.52s]  We would kindly protect my sentry for like two seconds.
[380.52s -> 382.52s]  Oh, I have one dude, Renbender.
[382.52s -> 384.52s]  He's just hanging out in spawn, just looking around.
[384.52s -> 386.52s]  Oh, cool.
[386.52s -> 389.27s]  I don't even know what's happening.
[389.27s -> 392.84s]  Now he's not.
[392.84s -> 393.84s]  Yes, he is.
[393.84s -> 396.74s]  Oh, they're so tall.
[396.74s -> 400.90s]  That's how they get their power.
[400.90s -> 401.90s]  Oh, that heavy.
[401.90s -> 403.90s]  Oh my gosh, he killed me instantly.
[403.90s -> 405.90s]  So much damage.
[405.90s -> 407.90s]  Sorry.
[407.90s -> 410.08s]  I'm so scared.
[410.08s -> 413.60s]  I love how they're all zombies, it's so funny.
[413.60s -> 415.10s]  Oh, are they?
[415.10s -> 417.17s]  Yeah, they are.
[417.17s -> 419.17s]  I'm too stupid and I didn't pay attention.
[419.17s -> 424.37s]  If you look at them with your eyes, they actually are zombies.
[424.37s -> 429.37s]  Oh, you see, that's what I forgot to do.
[429.37s -> 435.95s]  Dude, it's all about buying those crit canteens and just spamming around the corner.
[435.95s -> 439.54s]  I don't even care if I die.
[439.54s -> 440.84s]  What?
[440.84s -> 442.84s]  That is a really bad mentality.
[442.84s -> 444.84s]  You gotta care a little bit if you die.
[444.84s -> 448.10s]  Dude, you just gotta go hard.
[448.10s -> 452.01s]  Live fast.
[452.01s -> 456.68s]  So the intelligence reset, right?
[456.68s -> 458.68s]  Yeah, it's right there.
[458.68s -> 460.11s]  Yeah, but he's fat.
[460.11s -> 461.11s]  You can kill him.
[461.11s -> 463.99s]  Let's just push him over.
[463.99s -> 465.99s]  We need an equally fat guy to just push him.
[465.99s -> 467.99s]  Sentry buster, buster coming in.
[467.99s -> 469.23s]  Oh, star.
[469.23s -> 472.23s]  Oh, they sent my sentry right as the buster came up.
[472.23s -> 475.48s]  I'm so sorry.
[475.48s -> 477.48s]  But it's okay, I got an achievement.
[477.48s -> 479.48s]  Hey, achievements are good.
[479.48s -> 482.72s]  They like help you beat the wave better.
[482.72s -> 485.37s]  Oh wait, no they don't.
[485.37s -> 488.06s]  Wow, this is long.
[488.06s -> 491.02s]  Yeah, yeah.
[491.02s -> 492.02s]  That's what she said.
[492.02s -> 493.02s]  Yeah.
[493.02s -> 496.46s]  That is indeed what she said.
[496.46s -> 498.94s]  Live proof.
[498.94s -> 502.94s]  Oh, whoops, I accidentally bought ammo refill canteens.
[502.94s -> 504.94s]  This isn't helping me.
[504.94s -> 506.94s]  You're an engineer.
[506.94s -> 513.37s]  Probably the person that's the least useful in the entire game.
[513.37s -> 515.37s]  I love how this guy's just like taunting in the corner.
[515.37s -> 522.98s]  I'm gonna go back to the base and be useful.
[522.98s -> 524.98s]  Get useful things.
[524.98s -> 528.17s]  Back to the base.
[528.17s -> 531.37s]  Oh, look at that kill feed.
[531.37s -> 532.37s]  Here we go.
[532.37s -> 535.37s]  Who's ever put Mad Milk on is actually a super help right now.
[535.37s -> 542.60s]  Dude, I'm going up top.
[542.60s -> 544.60s]  I'm getting bird's eye view of this whole thing.
[544.60s -> 545.60s]  Oh, we got a tank.
[545.60s -> 547.90s]  Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[547.90s -> 548.90s]  There's ammo at the top, right?
[548.90s -> 550.90s]  You gotta spin something.
[550.90s -> 555.19s]  Mom's going back.
[555.19s -> 558.19s]  Does the tank have the normal amount of tank health?
[558.19s -> 560.19s]  I'm not sure.
[560.19s -> 562.19s]  Oh, those scouts are so accurate.
[562.19s -> 565.82s]  Oh no.
[565.82s -> 568.57s]  Out of ammo.
[568.57s -> 569.57s]  Oh, there's ammo in here.
[569.57s -> 570.57s]  This is so intense.
[570.57s -> 573.57s]  I'm writing like a whole thing in my diary about this afterwards.
[573.57s -> 581.82s]  Sentry buster.
[581.82s -> 582.82s]  Get rid of that tank.
[582.82s -> 591.71s]  Too intense.
[591.71s -> 596.56s]  Another tank?
[596.56s -> 598.56s]  Holy crap.
[598.56s -> 601.34s]  Oh, I got no ammo.
[601.34s -> 602.34s]  Give me, give me, give me.
[602.34s -> 604.34s]  Well, this first tank's almost down.
[604.34s -> 606.34s]  There's a scout on the side with the bomb.
[606.34s -> 609.34s]  You can't let him bomb it because if he bombs it, I think that's what makes us lose.
[609.34s -> 611.34s]  Is when people use a bomb.
[611.34s -> 613.77s]  Oh boy, yeah, he's got it.
[613.77s -> 615.77s]  Yep, they have scouts about to score him.
[615.77s -> 619.91s]  No.
[619.91s -> 620.91s]  Wow.
[620.91s -> 622.91s]  While I'm happy for that scout, kill him.
[622.91s -> 624.91s]  Well, that was very close.
[624.91s -> 629.34s]  I'm glad Star Fidget out that they were about to score it.
[629.34s -> 632.34s]  Yeah, I always keep track of who's scoring and who's not scoring.
[632.34s -> 635.10s]  Yeah, that's good.
[635.10s -> 636.10s]  There again.
[636.10s -> 637.10s]  These guys got crits.
[637.10s -> 639.66s]  Wow.
[639.66s -> 643.66s]  I warn you, you should actually really, really get crit resistance for this wave as soon as you can.
[643.66s -> 645.66s]  Because it reduces damage on like everything.
[645.66s -> 647.66s]  By the way, they have two tanks that have zero damage done to them.
[647.66s -> 648.66s]  Hey, watch it, scout, scout, scout.
[648.66s -> 650.83s]  I got an ammo scout on the point.
[650.83s -> 651.83s]  Wow, that was good.
[651.83s -> 658.32s]  Good pyro.
[658.32s -> 659.32s]  Oh, that's fine.
[659.32s -> 660.32s]  Wow.
[660.32s -> 662.32s]  There's a tank right here that has like almost full health.
[662.32s -> 665.82s]  I still got time.
[665.82s -> 670.58s]  I got to go get crit booster to kill this thing.
[670.58s -> 685.10s]  Bomb him.
[685.10s -> 687.10s]  Out of ammo again.
[687.10s -> 688.10s]  We're missing money.
[688.10s -> 691.30s]  Worry about that instead.
[691.30s -> 693.48s]  I need the money.
[693.48s -> 694.48s]  I'm out of ammo.
[694.48s -> 696.23s]  My children.
[696.23s -> 699.56s]  Yeah, that money back there.
[699.56s -> 702.63s]  Yeah, we got this tank stuff.
[702.63s -> 704.63s]  Got another one literally right around the corner though.
[704.63s -> 710.15s]  We're doing a lot better than I thought we would.
[710.15s -> 713.65s]  I did like the outro for the video already.
[713.65s -> 716.08s]  Wait, what?
[716.08s -> 720.08s]  I told everyone that I hope they enjoyed the video.
[720.08s -> 724.52s]  I exploded.
[724.52s -> 725.52s]  Oh, no.
[725.52s -> 726.52s]  Damn it.
[726.52s -> 728.70s]  Oh, you taunting scout.
[728.70s -> 740.22s]  Oh, wow.
[740.22s -> 741.22s]  Smoke him.
[741.22s -> 746.33s]  Yeah, that's not strong.
[746.33s -> 751.43s]  Nice job.
[751.43s -> 752.43s]  Give me that ammo.
[752.43s -> 753.74s]  Okay, bombs going back soon too.
[753.74s -> 756.74s]  So I'm going to try and move my sentry up as soon as that goes right.
[756.74s -> 760.49s]  Diddle.
[760.49s -> 763.79s]  Oh, a lot of these scouts.
[763.79s -> 767.02s]  Give me the health.
[767.02s -> 768.02s]  Give me the health.
[768.02s -> 769.19s]  Give me the health.
[769.19s -> 772.19s]  Did you just say these scouts are super good?
[772.19s -> 773.19s]  Wait, what?
[773.19s -> 774.19s]  Oh, my God.
[774.19s -> 776.19s]  These bots are just.
[776.19s -> 777.19s]  Dude, these scouts are good.
[777.19s -> 781.62s]  They've got probably got a lot of playing time.
[781.62s -> 784.62s]  All right, we got like a second or two.
[784.62s -> 785.62s]  All right.
[785.62s -> 787.06s]  Yeah.
[787.06s -> 788.06s]  You got a second or two.
[788.06s -> 791.68s]  Bunch of big demos.
[791.68s -> 792.68s]  Did I get spies?
[792.68s -> 794.82s]  No.
[794.82s -> 796.57s]  Get those crits.
[796.57s -> 799.57s]  Oh, look at that barrage of death coming towards us.
[799.57s -> 801.57s]  So much spam, I know.
[801.57s -> 805.00s]  Oh, oh, oh.
[805.00s -> 807.00s]  Oh, you should name it Sandy.
[807.00s -> 808.00s]  Goodness.
[808.00s -> 810.00s]  Oh, too soon.
[810.00s -> 811.00s]  Actually, not soon enough.
[811.00s -> 812.00s]  It hasn't happened yet.
[812.00s -> 813.00s]  Great damage.
[813.00s -> 814.00s]  There we go.
[814.00s -> 816.00s]  I know, but I thought about it ahead of time.
[816.00s -> 819.54s]  Another tank.
[819.54s -> 823.55s]  Oh, these these guys are.
[823.55s -> 825.92s]  Oh, my God.
[825.92s -> 826.92s]  Danny bots too good.
[826.92s -> 828.67s]  Oh, that's not good.
[828.67s -> 829.67s]  That's not good.
[829.67s -> 833.02s]  That's not good.
[833.02s -> 834.02s]  Got to get rid of this guy.
[834.02s -> 837.86s]  Oh, there's another tank in here.
[837.86s -> 839.86s]  Oh, they're about to like score kind of.
[839.86s -> 840.86s]  Well, you should kill them.
[840.86s -> 841.86s]  Oh, we got it.
[841.86s -> 842.86s]  I'm trying.
[842.86s -> 843.86s]  They're killing me.
[843.86s -> 845.86s]  Oh, there's a lot of demos here.
[845.86s -> 852.93s]  Oh, oh, get up.
[852.93s -> 856.17s]  Oh, I thought he died.
[856.17s -> 858.17s]  Well, not your friends anymore.
[858.17s -> 860.17s]  Oh, dude, he died.
[860.17s -> 861.17s]  He like exploded.
[861.17s -> 864.56s]  Oh, well, poop.
[864.56s -> 867.18s]  It was a good attempt, though.
[867.18s -> 871.62s]  I mean, we only got to like 30 or 40 percent down, but that's intense.
[871.62s -> 872.62s]  That is crazy.
[872.62s -> 875.56s]  So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[875.56s -> 877.56s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[877.56s -> 878.56s]  I really do appreciate it.
[878.56s -> 881.56s]  And wave 666 is no joke.
[881.56s -> 886.56s]  So while you have the time, while the event is still going, I'm not sure if they are going to end it or not.
[886.56s -> 888.56s]  They probably will still have it able to be selected.
[888.56s -> 890.56s]  But go try it out for yourselves.
[890.56s -> 893.56s]  If you complete it, congratulations to you because it is pretty difficult.
[893.56s -> 895.56s]  So, again, thank you so much for watching.
[895.56s -> 896.56s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[896.56s -> 899.56s]  And, of course, take care, everybody.
