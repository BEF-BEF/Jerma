[0.31s -> 15.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Chirrma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[15.50s -> 20.50s]  And tonight's gonna have two one-life gameplays back-to-back here. I'm in a one-life mood.
[20.50s -> 26.50s]  I really don't know why, but the last couple of days it's been all about the streaks, less about the full gameplays.
[26.50s -> 34.68s]  But today, I have a very, very special guest. And it is, of course, you probably guessed it by the title,
[34.68s -> 42.92s]  Grandpa. Because, of course, Grandpa is an MLG pro, is returning to Machinima Respawn tonight.
[42.92s -> 49.92s]  That is right. Well, actually, let me rephrase that. There's gonna be a trailer tonight for the second season of Grandpa.
[49.92s -> 53.92s]  And it's pretty crazy. I had a lot of fun doing it, a lot of fun making it.
[53.92s -> 59.92s]  So, 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time tonight. I'm not sure when this video is gonna go up today,
[59.92s -> 66.92s]  but 8 p.m. Eastern Time is when the Grandpa MLG Season 2 trailer is gonna be on Machinima Respawn.
[66.92s -> 73.10s]  So, check that out. Please everybody go support it. Like you always do, you guys are incredible.
[73.10s -> 78.10s]  But, let's break down the gameplays for a second before Grandpa makes his appearance.
[78.10s -> 81.10s]  So, the gameplays, of course, are gonna be Scout and Sniper.
[81.10s -> 87.10s]  Using mostly the defaults, because, of course, my final 33% of my backpack was given away.
[87.10s -> 91.10s]  So, all I got is a bunch of strangers and a couple of untradeable hats and stuff.
[91.10s -> 95.51s]  So, I'm working my way back. Let's just put it that way.
[95.51s -> 101.51s]  So, it's gonna be the regular Scattergun, the Mad Milk, which apparently I still had, and the default Bat.
[101.51s -> 106.51s]  And for the Sniper, gonna be default Sniper Rifle, the Jurati, I think. Yeah, the Jurati.
[106.51s -> 113.12s]  And the Shiv, the Travelman Shiv. That was a nice derp moment right there.
[113.12s -> 116.12s]  But yeah, anyways, I hope you guys enjoy those. They're gonna be in the background.
[116.12s -> 119.12s]  But I am bringing on Grandpa right now. Yes?
[119.12s -> 120.12s]  It's time for me to come on.
[120.12s -> 121.12s]  Yes, you are coming on right now.
[121.12s -> 122.12s]  Yes.
[122.12s -> 126.12s]  So, we want to talk about Season 2. We want to talk about some frequently asked questions to Grandpa.
[126.12s -> 128.12s]  These are all for me, right?
[128.12s -> 129.12s]  Yes.
[129.12s -> 130.12s]  They're all for me.
[130.12s -> 133.12s]  None of these are gonna be for me. These are questions all for you.
[133.12s -> 134.12s]  They better be.
[134.12s -> 135.30s]  Okay.
[135.30s -> 137.30s]  I'm not gonna sit down here if they're not all for me.
[137.30s -> 141.30s]  These questions are frequently asked, and I gotta tell you guys.
[141.30s -> 145.30s]  To you guys for all the support you give me in my video game shit.
[145.30s -> 147.30s]  It's very, very awesome.
[147.30s -> 150.30s]  And let's start with the questions, Jeremy.
[150.30s -> 151.30s]  Okay, all right.
[151.30s -> 156.54s]  So, question number one is, what is your favorite Team Fortress 2 class?
[156.54s -> 160.78s]  The Heavy. It's the Heavy. There's no doubt in my mind it's the Heavy.
[160.78s -> 164.78s]  Because you just hold the right mouse button down, and you just annihilate people.
[164.78s -> 167.78s]  Why would you ever play as any other class?
[167.78s -> 170.78s]  Why is it not just all Heavies versus all Heavies?
[170.78s -> 172.78s]  I don't see a reason for anything else.
[172.78s -> 175.78s]  I mean, why wouldn't you? You're the most powerful thing in the game.
[175.78s -> 179.78s]  It wouldn't work. Team Fortress 2, it says it right in the title.
[179.78s -> 182.78s]  It's all balanced around the certain classes.
[182.78s -> 186.78s]  If everyone went Heavy on one team, there would be two snipers that would just have a field day.
[186.78s -> 188.78s]  No, that wouldn't really work.
[188.78s -> 191.78s]  Spies, too. You'd get one spy on the team. It would kill nine people.
[191.78s -> 193.78s]  No, but you're wrong.
[193.78s -> 198.78s]  Because if you have two Heavies, one standing in front of you and one standing behind you,
[198.78s -> 203.78s]  you're not going to be in the fucking sandwich. Oh, I forgot. I can't swear on your channel.
[203.78s -> 207.08s]  That's okay, but keep it to a minimum.
[207.08s -> 210.45s]  So, anyways, okay, so Heavy's your favorite class.
[210.45s -> 215.80s]  So the second question is, what is Grandpa's favorite video game?
[215.80s -> 219.80s]  It can be from ten years ago or yesterday, whatever came out. I don't know.
[219.80s -> 222.80s]  No, that's an easy one. That's Call of Duty 4.
[222.80s -> 226.80s]  It's Modern Warfare 4. It was called something like that.
[226.80s -> 232.80s]  That's a good rest of the best game I've ever played. It was perfect balance, perfect kill streaks.
[232.80s -> 236.80s]  That's my favorite game. College 4 is my favorite.
[236.80s -> 241.98s]  You got a second favorite? Because, I mean, mine probably goes Team Fortress, Diablo.
[241.98s -> 244.98s]  I mean, I got a lot, so I got like probably four or five favorite games.
[244.98s -> 251.28s]  Well, it would probably be College 4 and then Leisure Suit Larry, the first one.
[251.28s -> 252.28s]  What? No.
[253.28s -> 258.28s]  Yeah, that was a fun game. It was a point-and-click adventure game, but it was really screwed up.
[258.28s -> 264.28s]  There was all kinds of adult stuff going on. That was my favorite game, I tell you. I had a lot of fun playing that.
[264.28s -> 272.71s]  All right, so Call of Duty 4 and Leisure Suit Larry. That makes perfect sense, apparently.
[272.71s -> 279.13s]  So one more question before the video is over. This question gets asked all the time, Grandpa.
[279.13s -> 282.13s]  This is asked the most out of any of these questions.
[282.13s -> 283.13s]  Let's hear it.
[283.13s -> 292.06s]  When are we going to see your face? When are we going to get a Grandpa face cam video?
[292.06s -> 299.23s]  Oh, you want to see my face, huh? You want to see my face? Okay. Put a date and time on it.
[299.23s -> 306.23s]  We are going to see Grandpa's face on December 22, 2012.
[306.23s -> 310.23s]  Because if the goddamn world doesn't end, then I swear to God I'll do it.
[310.23s -> 316.23s]  So be sure to be ready to say that. December 22, after the world collapses.
[316.23s -> 318.23s]  So that's a good thing to look forward to.
[318.23s -> 321.23s]  I would probably also say that, too.
[321.23s -> 325.23s]  Thank you for showing up here, Grandpa. The video is over.
[325.23s -> 327.23s]  So guys, make sure to check...
[327.23s -> 334.23s]  Make sure you check out my Machinima Respond series on Saturdays at 8 p.m. Eastern Time.
[334.23s -> 337.23s]  And that's Grandpa's and MLG Pro Season 2.
[337.23s -> 342.23s]  It started May 12th. So get your ass over there and go watch the trailer.
[342.23s -> 343.23s]  Okay, bye.
[343.23s -> 345.23s]  Alright, see you later.
[345.23s -> 347.23s]  See you later, bye, asshole.
[347.23s -> 351.54s]  Okay. Thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[351.54s -> 357.02s]  And I will see you guys all next time. So take care, everybody.
