[0.18s -> 2.58s]  It's a late night tonight, late start tonight.
[4.08s -> 6.59s]  Shay, don't wake up your parents.
[8.95s -> 10.05s]  How's everybody doing? How are you?
[11.29s -> 13.53s]  You know me. You already know who I am.
[15.61s -> 17.31s]  Finally, now it's time to go to bed.
[22.32s -> 24.62s]  I've had a very disappointing day today.
[26.12s -> 27.52s]  Are you ready to get vented at?
[29.54s -> 34.24s]  How this could have been a much more anger riddled rant.
[35.01s -> 36.11s]  Maybe three hours ago.
[36.98s -> 38.08s]  Some of you were in the chat.
[39.14s -> 42.84s]  And I was a little irritated, just maybe slightly, not very much.
[43.34s -> 47.28s]  Let me just open up my... I deserve this, okay? It's a powerade.
[48.25s -> 48.75s]  Yup.
[49.25s -> 51.25s]  I need these electrolytes today.
[52.31s -> 54.01s]  I deserve a purple powerade.
[58.44s -> 59.94s]  Uh, my Vive is broken.
[61.23s -> 63.73s]  That's not even a joke. It sucks.
[64.63s -> 66.53s]  I don't know what's wrong with it. I don't know what happened.
[70.82s -> 72.22s]  I streamed VR.
[73.77s -> 76.90s]  Like, what? A year ago?
[78.03s -> 78.83s]  Eight months ago?
[80.60s -> 83.20s]  I finished with it. Okay, we'll put it in the box for a little while.
[84.14s -> 85.64s]  I put the damn thing in the box.
[87.60s -> 89.10s]  Close it up. Nothing happened to it.
[90.88s -> 93.58s]  I didn't, like, dropkick this thing into the closet.
[97.14s -> 101.34s]  But, I got it out today. We're gonna do VR.
[102.02s -> 102.92s]  It's gonna come back.
[104.18s -> 107.68s]  And, hey, look at this. I already was streaming on this thing.
[107.68s -> 109.58s]  I've already got it to work, like, a year ago.
[110.62s -> 112.72s]  So I take it out of the box. I start plugging shit in.
[113.32s -> 115.42s]  And things are going fine. My lighthouses are fine.
[115.42s -> 117.22s]  They're connected. They're green. Everything's fine.
[117.72s -> 118.92s]  But the headset doesn't work.
[120.66s -> 122.76s]  I cannot get the headset to get recognized.
[123.46s -> 126.26s]  No matter what I do. I was sitting here for six and a half hours.
[127.70s -> 130.20s]  I was about to reinstall Windows.
[131.46s -> 132.46s]  That was the final straw.
[133.37s -> 134.97s]  But it was gonna take too long.
[136.29s -> 138.49s]  And I can play this game that we're gonna play tonight.
[139.17s -> 142.97s]  Not on VR. I'm gonna be the one person in this lobby not playing VR.
[144.11s -> 146.81s]  I'm gonna be a default regular screen guy.
[147.51s -> 148.71s]  Which, that's stupid.
[151.03s -> 154.63s]  I'm gonna be playing with Vinnie, Ross, and Giwi.
[154.63s -> 155.63s]  Hope I'm saying that name right.
[157.47s -> 160.37s]  It should be fun. I mean, it's a ghost hunting game. I'm sure it'll be cool.
[162.74s -> 163.74s]  But I tried everything.
[164.44s -> 165.64s]  Different USBs.
[166.24s -> 167.74s]  Different connectors.
[168.24s -> 172.34s]  I've reinstalled SteamVR. SteamVR Beta. SteamVR Alpha.
[174.88s -> 178.88s]  I uninstalled Steam. Reinstalled Steam. I restarted my computer a hundred times.
[179.58s -> 182.88s]  I did every Reddit fix. And usually the Reddit fixes work really well.
[182.88s -> 184.48s]  The Reddit fixes work very well.
[185.58s -> 186.18s]  None of them worked.
[187.15s -> 188.65s]  It's error code 108.
[189.05s -> 191.45s]  And I think my headset's just fucking broken.
[193.06s -> 193.66s]  I don't know how.
[195.81s -> 198.01s]  Drivers did them all. Did all the drivers. Updated every driver.
[198.01s -> 203.64s]  Guys, I even updated the drivers on your computer that you never update.
[205.80s -> 209.80s]  I updated my like, HID mouse compliant driver.
[211.09s -> 212.19s]  You don't even need that.
[212.59s -> 213.39s]  And I got it.
[216.70s -> 219.20s]  I got it every single driver.
[219.70s -> 222.00s]  I don't know what happened. I'm getting a new computer. Fuck this.
[222.80s -> 224.20s]  I'm gonna have a new computer.
[225.29s -> 228.59s]  This time, next July. No. Soon. Within a month.
[229.19s -> 232.09s]  I'm getting a new computer within the next month. Within the next couple of weeks.
[237.28s -> 237.68s]  We'll see.
[243.04s -> 243.94s]  But for now...
[246.28s -> 248.48s]  I'm gonna be joined pretty shortly here.
[249.44s -> 250.24s]  By Vinny.
[251.40s -> 252.50s]  Well, you know I love Vinny.
[255.10s -> 258.80s]  Me and Vinny been trying to... Hey, you wanna do something? Let's do like a stream together.
[259.10s -> 259.50s]  Hey.
[260.00s -> 260.40s]  Bingo.
[261.10s -> 262.00s]  VR stream.
[262.50s -> 263.10s]  That's right.
[263.90s -> 266.40s]  Oh, but my VR is broken.
[267.57s -> 268.57s]  Oh.
[268.67s -> 269.17s]  It's alright.
[270.93s -> 272.33s]  It should be... It still should be fun.
[272.83s -> 275.83s]  This is probably not gonna be a very long stream because it's starting so late.
[280.30s -> 282.60s]  And we got FTK to look forward to this weekend.
[283.72s -> 286.36s]  Which not much anybody has to do to prepare for that.
[287.52s -> 289.12s]  I'm probably gonna go live.
[290.86s -> 291.36s]  On...
[292.90s -> 294.70s]  Friday or even later today.
[295.20s -> 296.60s]  Like tonight before I turn this off.
[297.30s -> 298.40s]  And to kind of answer questions.
[304.21s -> 304.51s]  We'll see.
[307.00s -> 308.90s]  Server version mismatch?
[313.74s -> 316.24s]  What is... Why are you saying server version mismatch?
[319.28s -> 320.08s]  Why is everybody saying that?
[322.04s -> 323.24s]  That's what Vinny is saying.
[324.21s -> 326.21s]  Wait, I have the wrong version of the game?
[327.51s -> 330.11s]  Wait, can VR people not play...
[331.91s -> 335.31s]  With non-VR people? Don't make me even more sad than I already am today.
[335.91s -> 337.81s]  Don't make me even more sad.
[338.51s -> 339.71s]  No, they can't. Alright, alright.
[339.71s -> 342.31s]  I'm gonna... Let me reboot the game.
[342.81s -> 343.71s]  I'm gonna reboot the game.
[344.31s -> 345.41s]  I guess there was an update today.
[347.14s -> 347.54s]  Okay.
[347.94s -> 350.04s]  Don't make me even more sad than I already am.
[356.49s -> 358.39s]  Restarting game.
[358.69s -> 359.39s]  Let's see if there's an update.
[363.34s -> 366.24s]  Oh, and by the way, we were gonna like add each other on Steam and shit.
[366.24s -> 367.74s]  And I went into my friends.
[368.54s -> 370.84s]  I have like a thousand group invites.
[370.84s -> 373.24s]  I tried to decline the first one to make some room.
[373.44s -> 375.04s]  And my computer hanged.
[375.04s -> 376.54s]  Steam like crashed.
[377.34s -> 378.24s]  Come on Valve.
[379.92s -> 382.52s]  Do I have to individually click on every single one of these?
[383.73s -> 384.53s]  Mr. Popular?
[384.53s -> 387.83s]  No, no, this is over the course of like eight years.
[388.90s -> 390.50s]  This didn't happen like last weekend.
[390.90s -> 392.70s]  God, I need some of this Powerade right now.
[394.84s -> 396.34s]  Oh, let's see. Is it updated?
[397.82s -> 400.92s]  Alright, my Phasmophobia is updated right now.
[401.02s -> 401.62s]  Should be good.
[403.55s -> 404.25s]  Yeah, we're just chilling.
[404.25s -> 404.75s]  We're just chilling.
[404.75s -> 405.35s]  We're just chilling.
[406.48s -> 407.68s]  Guys, this is a late night stream.
[409.80s -> 411.70s]  This is an extra late night stream.
[412.47s -> 413.97s]  Get some of those fucking electrolytes to me.
[419.85s -> 420.55s]  Alright, loading game.
[422.73s -> 424.53s]  I'm probably gonna have to give a new friend code.
[424.83s -> 429.83s]  It's more like extra early for the...
[429.83s -> 431.53s]  Hey Storm, thanks for the 10 subs.
[431.83s -> 433.33s]  I know I'm gonna have Facecam on tonight.
[434.03s -> 437.23s]  But I haven't switched over yet because I don't want to leak the friend code.
[439.96s -> 440.86s]  Private game.
[443.30s -> 443.60s]  Let's see.
[443.60s -> 444.40s]  Alright, I got a new...
[444.40s -> 444.80s]  Let's see.
[447.02s -> 448.52s]  They can just join off the friend code, right?
[454.22s -> 454.62s]  I don't know what...
[454.62s -> 455.12s]  Yeah, they can.
[455.22s -> 455.52s]  Cool.
[456.36s -> 456.66s]  Is it game?
[456.66s -> 456.96s]  Is it game?
[456.96s -> 457.76s]  Ah, is it game?
[459.10s -> 459.40s]  Here.
[460.36s -> 460.76s]  Ready?
[463.07s -> 463.87s]  Ready to see me?
[464.47s -> 464.97s]  I don't know.
[464.97s -> 466.17s]  Am I ready to be on camera?
[472.65s -> 473.35s]  I didn't leak it.
[474.22s -> 474.92s]  I didn't leak it.
[474.92s -> 475.32s]  I'm good.
[477.61s -> 478.61s]  I got the invite code.
[478.61s -> 482.21s]  Oh, don't you wish you knew what that fucking friend invite code was.
[483.01s -> 485.41s]  Oh dude, Vinesauce just joined my lobby?
[489.70s -> 490.80s]  It's been a rough day today.
[492.46s -> 492.76s]  Hang on.
[492.86s -> 493.96s]  Sorry about the noises.
[496.22s -> 497.02s]  Fire alarm going off?
[499.91s -> 500.81s]  One second chat.
[501.51s -> 502.31s]  Is this fire alarm?
[502.41s -> 502.91s]  Is this fire...
[502.91s -> 504.51s]  Is there a fire in Vinny's house?
[506.80s -> 507.10s]  How do I...
[507.10s -> 507.80s]  I can hear him.
[514.86s -> 517.36s]  I can't look at the board because I think the code's up there.
[517.86s -> 518.46s]  So, um...
[519.06s -> 519.66s]  Jerma?
[519.96s -> 520.36s]  Can you hear me?
[523.01s -> 523.71s]  I can see him.
[523.71s -> 524.11s]  Jerma.
[524.41s -> 525.11s]  Wait, hold on.
[525.81s -> 526.61s]  Can you not hear me?
[529.28s -> 530.18s]  I don't think he can hear me.
[530.58s -> 531.18s]  Press V.
[531.48s -> 531.98s]  Can you hear me?
[533.24s -> 533.64s]  Oh, yeah.
[534.04s -> 534.84s]  Oh, nice.
[534.84s -> 535.24s]  It's V.
[535.24s -> 536.34s]  The code is on the screen.
[537.28s -> 537.68s]  It's Vinny.
[537.68s -> 538.08s]  Hi.
[538.38s -> 538.78s]  Hey.
[538.78s -> 540.18s]  Well, it's V to talk too.
[540.88s -> 541.48s]  What's up, man?
[541.48s -> 542.28s]  Oh, V did...
[542.48s -> 542.98s]  Oh, hey.
[542.98s -> 543.88s]  How you doing, man?
[543.98s -> 544.98s]  It's nice to talk to you again.
[546.66s -> 549.16s]  I thought there was a fire alarm going off in your house.
[551.29s -> 551.79s]  Wait, what?
[551.79s -> 552.59s]  Does it sound bad?
[553.09s -> 554.59s]  No, I just hear like a...
[554.59s -> 556.69s]  Rii, rii, rii, rii.
[558.61s -> 559.51s]  Chat, do you hear it?
[559.61s -> 560.71s]  Fire alarm.
[564.22s -> 566.22s]  No, don't show my fucking warthand.
[567.22s -> 568.22s]  Why do I hear that?
[568.22s -> 570.22s]  Is that in my house?
[571.64s -> 572.34s]  Are you okay?
[572.34s -> 573.44s]  Do you need assistance?
[574.50s -> 575.70s]  What is my house?
[575.70s -> 576.80s]  It's like burning.
[579.86s -> 580.76s]  I hear crickets.
[582.49s -> 584.39s]  I usually do when I stream, but that's...
[585.59s -> 586.19s]  Yeah, me too.
[586.19s -> 586.69s]  Me too.
[587.76s -> 588.36s]  Is it weird?
[588.36s -> 590.26s]  Can I make it so that I don't have to push the talk?
[591.06s -> 592.36s]  This audio is like sounds pretty good.
[593.62s -> 594.12s]  It's good.
[594.12s -> 594.42s]  Yeah.
[594.42s -> 595.82s]  Um, I don't know though.
[595.82s -> 600.02s]  There's, there's some options, but it's, it's a little lacking in the VR end.
[600.52s -> 601.82s]  How is the VR by the way?
[602.52s -> 608.50s]  It would be better for you because you have a Vive, but it's not very index-friendly.
[610.57s -> 611.57s]  Yeah, I wish I could be there in the VR.
[611.57s -> 612.07s]  It's cool though.
[613.74s -> 619.54s]  Yeah, so chat, Jerma has some VR issues, headset, like just not turning on issues.
[621.86s -> 623.36s]  Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[623.66s -> 625.86s]  I've been trying to troubleshoot for the last six hours.
[625.86s -> 628.76s]  I have no idea what's wrong with my computer or what's wrong with the headset.
[628.76s -> 633.36s]  All I know is that I'm going to throw it into the garbage disposal and turn it on as high as it can go.
[636.26s -> 640.26s]  Six hours, you'll never get back, but maybe this will be worth it.
[640.96s -> 643.26s]  Hey, hey, it's, it's always worth it.
[643.66s -> 647.26s]  It's always worth it if, if we get to do something together.
[648.97s -> 650.87s]  That is just fantastic.
[650.87s -> 651.47s]  Thank you, Jerma.
[651.47s -> 652.97s]  Remember the last time we did something together?
[653.27s -> 654.47s]  It was Red Dead Redemption 2.
[654.47s -> 655.97s]  My computer sucked on that one too.
[656.97s -> 660.37s]  Should I, should I just like go stream at an internet cafe or something?
[661.86s -> 663.56s]  Um, you could go to a McDonald's.
[666.16s -> 669.96s]  No, I think that was Rockstar's fault more than anything.
[670.26s -> 670.96s]  Yeah, maybe.
[671.56s -> 672.26s]  It was still funny though.
[672.26s -> 673.56s]  So we can just blame Rockstar.
[674.56s -> 675.66s]  I have a question for you.
[675.66s -> 679.46s]  Is the code of this room on the screen right now on that wall?
[680.56s -> 682.46s]  The way that you did that, you're just like presenting.
[683.16s -> 686.16s]  Yeah, it's, I think it's hidden, but maybe it's only hidden for me.
[688.62s -> 689.32s]  Should I look?
[689.42s -> 690.02s]  I don't know.
[692.38s -> 692.98s]  Can you see it?
[696.41s -> 697.91s]  You're gonna need a new code, my dude.
[703.42s -> 704.02s]  New code?
[704.32s -> 704.62s]  All right.
[704.62s -> 705.02s]  Yeah.
[705.22s -> 707.22s]  Well, I guess, I guess I can't hide it for everybody.
[708.70s -> 709.10s]  Shit.
[711.40s -> 712.10s]  Well, hey, look at this.
[712.10s -> 713.00s]  Nobody's joining.
[714.90s -> 715.90s]  Oh, give them a minute.
[716.10s -> 722.02s]  Um, Ross is probably still doing the tutorial, but, uh, yeah, I'll just take a
[722.02s -> 723.22s]  seat while this is happening.
[724.23s -> 728.43s]  Yeah, I, uh, I, I did the tutorial a little bit, but I kind of don't really
[728.83s -> 729.93s]  know what it means.
[729.93s -> 733.03s]  I know that we, we have devices and we have to put books on the ground and
[733.13s -> 736.63s]  the ghost writes in the book and something like that.
[736.63s -> 739.23s]  You get a flashlight, you get a computer, a camera.
[739.63s -> 741.03s]  I have no idea how to play this game.
[741.03s -> 741.53s]  Yeah.
[742.13s -> 745.03s]  So there's, um, I got a kind of an idea.
[745.03s -> 747.13s]  Have you ever watched Ghost Adventures?
[748.46s -> 749.46s]  Ghost Adventures?
[750.88s -> 753.08s]  Or, uh, any of the Ghost Hunter shows?
[755.48s -> 757.58s]  Well, I've seen, uh, the ones with everybody's green.
[757.98s -> 760.08s]  Uh, there was lit up and overexposed in green.
[761.18s -> 761.58s]  Right.
[761.98s -> 763.18s]  Yeah, I've seen, I've seen clips.
[764.36s -> 764.86s]  Yeah.
[764.96s -> 769.26s]  So, um, it's just a variety of tools that you use to discover
[769.26s -> 770.26s]  spoopy ghosts.
[770.86s -> 772.76s]  And, uh, who is this?
[775.07s -> 775.47s]  I don't know.
[778.15s -> 780.55s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is weird.
[782.19s -> 782.89s]  I think I can boot them.
[792.95s -> 793.35s]  What happened?
[794.85s -> 795.05s]  All right.
[795.05s -> 796.05s]  New code, new code.
[796.05s -> 797.05s]  Let's, I'm going to turn this off.
[798.04s -> 799.04s]  I don't want you guys to see it either.
[800.46s -> 801.96s]  I got to make it so I can fucking not have pushed it.
[801.96s -> 802.86s]  I don't want to do push to talk.
[803.16s -> 805.26s]  By the way, this game records all of everything you say.
[806.79s -> 808.39s]  There's like a, it's like speech recognition.
[808.39s -> 809.89s]  You're like, you actually talk to the ghost.
[811.02s -> 811.12s]  All right.
[811.12s -> 811.42s]  Hold on.
[814.23s -> 815.03s]  Audio.
[816.52s -> 816.92s]  Where is it?
[816.92s -> 817.22s]  Where is it?
[817.22s -> 817.92s]  Controls?
[817.92s -> 818.72s]  PC settings.
[822.31s -> 824.91s]  Local push to talk off, right?
[826.71s -> 827.91s]  That's just keep that off.
[829.36s -> 830.06s]  We booted Vinny.
[830.06s -> 830.56s]  Well, I don't know.
[830.56s -> 832.36s]  That guy might've just started screaming swears.
[832.46s -> 833.16s]  We've got to be careful.
[834.54s -> 834.64s]  All right.
[834.64s -> 835.14s]  Let's try this.
[838.84s -> 839.64s]  I got a new code.
[840.93s -> 841.73s]  I don't want you to see it.
[841.83s -> 842.83s]  I'm going to type it in here.
[844.80s -> 845.90s]  This is a late night stream guys.
[846.40s -> 846.80s]  Relax.
[852.69s -> 852.99s]  Okay.
[855.94s -> 856.64s]  Late night stream.
[859.43s -> 860.43s]  Got chocolate hair.
[861.96s -> 862.36s]  Whatever.
[862.56s -> 863.76s]  That doesn't bother me right now.
[864.16s -> 869.06s]  What bothers me right now is my vibe being broken.
[869.76s -> 872.76s]  I was going to play Half-Life Alex next week and like, no, what am I going to do?
[872.76s -> 873.86s]  What am I going to do with this thing?
[874.70s -> 876.10s]  I got to get like a new computer.
[881.22s -> 882.92s]  Oh, Ross just asked in the discord.
[882.92s -> 884.02s]  Hey, I'm out of the tutorial.
[884.42s -> 885.02s]  What now?
[885.12s -> 886.82s]  I just wrote a series of numbers.
[887.80s -> 890.10s]  Uh, that I don't know if they know what that means.
[892.26s -> 892.66s]  Hold on.
[895.19s -> 895.89s]  Oh, oh, hey.
[896.89s -> 898.59s]  Oh, can you hear me without the push talk?
[899.96s -> 900.26s]  Yeah.
[900.56s -> 900.96s]  Yes.
[903.75s -> 906.15s]  So we can change our characters too.
[906.15s -> 906.75s]  Apparently.
[907.75s -> 908.25s]  Yeah, we can.
[909.61s -> 911.11s]  We could be over.
[911.11s -> 911.41s]  We want.
[911.41s -> 913.01s]  Wait, we can all be the same person.
[916.36s -> 918.76s]  There's some people.
[923.84s -> 924.04s]  All right.
[924.04s -> 926.34s]  So when we select a job, what do you guys want to do for a job?
[928.78s -> 930.26s]  Um, not too sure.
[930.26s -> 931.66s]  Also Ross and Kiwi.
[931.66s -> 933.86s]  If you guys are talking, we don't, we don't hear you.
[934.06s -> 934.16s]  Yeah.
[934.16s -> 937.26s]  You got to hold V or you got to go in your PC settings.
[937.26s -> 940.36s]  You got to scroll all the way down and turn off the local push to talk.
[941.06s -> 942.63s]  I think they're in VR though.
[943.33s -> 944.63s]  Oh, wait, their hands are wacky.
[946.13s -> 947.13s]  They're stuck in VR.
[947.13s -> 954.14s]  But yeah, you know, you don't hear the, uh, like the fire alarm.
[955.53s -> 956.93s]  No, that's so funny.
[956.93s -> 957.53s]  I wonder why.
[961.23s -> 961.63s]  What about, okay.
[961.63s -> 963.13s]  Jobs selected job.
[964.76s -> 965.46s]  No contracts.
[965.46s -> 966.46s]  I don't have that option.
[967.52s -> 967.92s]  Okay.
[967.92s -> 973.56s]  Um, it's like a power puff girls, uh, Gendi Tartovsky version of the United
[973.56s -> 974.26s]  States and Canada.
[975.36s -> 978.46s]  We have Edgefield, which is California.
[979.92s -> 984.62s]  Rafton farmhouse, which is it looks like in Texas or Ridgeview Roadhouse,
[984.62s -> 985.82s]  which looks like somewhere in Michigan.
[988.41s -> 991.71s]  Um, Michigan sounds pretty haunted in general.
[991.81s -> 992.11s]  Yeah.
[992.51s -> 995.11s]  I mean, Michigan's bordering Lake Erie, right?
[995.81s -> 996.61s]  Oh, that's right.
[996.61s -> 997.11s]  That's right.
[997.11s -> 997.51s]  It is.
[999.09s -> 999.29s]  All right.
[999.29s -> 1002.99s]  So this is called difficulty amateur recommended team size two.
[1002.99s -> 1003.59s]  We got four.
[1003.59s -> 1004.09s]  We are right.
[1007.42s -> 1011.16s]  That's the movements you do when you're like in the shower, Ross and Kiwi.
[1011.16s -> 1014.46s]  Once again, if you guys are talking, we don't hear you hear you at all on this
[1014.46s -> 1019.59s]  end, your karate chopping pretty nicely in the air.
[1020.89s -> 1022.69s]  I was going to say that's like, that's like that's when you do that.
[1022.69s -> 1025.09s]  When you're like bathing, like when you're trying to get like under your
[1025.09s -> 1025.49s]  outfit.
[1027.19s -> 1031.39s]  So this is this is a two story, four bedroom house with a basement.
[1031.89s -> 1034.49s]  We just got confirmation of a possible ghost sighting here.
[1035.29s -> 1036.79s]  This one sounds it guns in this game.
[1039.72s -> 1041.22s]  Like we're going to get, we get done work.
[1042.54s -> 1043.44s]  This one sounds dangerous.
[1043.44s -> 1044.64s]  You'll have to be careful with this one.
[1044.64s -> 1046.24s]  Gather evidence and leave as soon as you can.
[1046.24s -> 1047.24s]  More info when you arrive.
[1050.95s -> 1052.15s]  The guns are for each other.
[1052.15s -> 1054.95s]  Like in case we betray each other and scare each other.
[1057.73s -> 1058.83s]  Looks like all right.
[1059.13s -> 1060.13s]  Who is who here?
[1060.13s -> 1061.33s]  I keep people keep.
[1061.33s -> 1062.13s]  No, is that me?
[1065.48s -> 1065.68s]  Yeah.
[1065.68s -> 1069.08s]  So every like we're kind of all the same character right now.
[1069.08s -> 1072.58s]  But I imagine when we spawn in we'll all be a different character.
[1075.09s -> 1075.79s]  Roblox.
[1078.49s -> 1079.29s]  That's Ross.
[1079.29s -> 1079.59s]  Yeah.
[1081.52s -> 1082.42s]  That's pretty good name.
[1083.94s -> 1084.84s]  I'll be this dude.
[1084.94s -> 1086.74s]  I'll be Zuckerberg.
[1086.74s -> 1087.34s]  That's fine.
[1090.70s -> 1095.33s]  I'm just going to be I don't know guy with jacket too.
[1096.56s -> 1100.56s]  So so Ross and Kiwi are both leaving and they're going to do some settings
[1100.56s -> 1101.76s]  and try to come back.
[1101.86s -> 1102.16s]  Okay.
[1103.60s -> 1104.40s]  I'm good, babe.
[1104.40s -> 1105.00s]  We're just chilling.
[1106.84s -> 1108.54s]  I usually how are how are you?
[1109.14s -> 1109.84s]  I've been pretty good.
[1110.64s -> 1111.44s]  Hope you've been good too.
[1112.75s -> 1113.85s]  Yeah, I've been doing all right.
[1113.95s -> 1118.65s]  I I've adapted to our nightmare world a little bit.
[1119.35s -> 1122.05s]  Yeah, it's been kind of chaotic.
[1122.05s -> 1125.90s]  But yeah, you know, you just do what you got to do.
[1127.17s -> 1131.57s]  Hopefully we can get back to normal soon in the next few months.
[1131.57s -> 1134.06s]  I hope yeah.
[1134.76s -> 1137.26s]  I mean until then though, we at least have ghost hunting.
[1137.76s -> 1138.76s]  At least we have ghost on it.
[1138.76s -> 1141.46s]  We have green overexposed face show.
[1142.72s -> 1145.92s]  Yeah, I'm sorry green overexposed face show with
[1146.22s -> 1152.02s]  camera pointing up to chin getting like weird profile like below under
[1152.02s -> 1153.02s]  profile of face.
[1154.22s -> 1158.12s]  Really like just disturbing visions of humanity from that show.
[1159.62s -> 1163.42s]  But also you have to wonder like when they when they do that,
[1163.42s -> 1166.52s]  like do they accidentally pick up semen that they have to edit out?
[1167.98s -> 1171.08s]  Where you like like what's that stain on the kitchen table?
[1171.88s -> 1175.18s]  And it's like, oh, oh God me and the husband we were well.
[1176.88s -> 1177.68s]  Ignore it.
[1178.58s -> 1179.58s]  It's everywhere.
[1181.16s -> 1183.66s]  This whole house is just covered with ectoplasm.
[1183.86s -> 1186.46s]  How did it get on top of the cabinets in the kitchen?
[1187.89s -> 1190.49s]  Well, I mean, of course must have been up there and probably
[1190.49s -> 1192.09s]  still got a late-night snack.
[1193.22s -> 1194.62s]  Gordon Ramsay on the case.
[1197.36s -> 1198.66s]  He did a hotel show.
[1199.06s -> 1202.26s]  He did a hotel show where like, you know, this is a Michelin star
[1202.26s -> 1206.26s]  winning chef and he like goes into these like disgusting hotel rooms
[1206.26s -> 1209.16s]  and he like shines the flashlight the black light on like the bed
[1209.46s -> 1212.46s]  and he's like, oh, oh, it's fucking disgusting.
[1212.66s -> 1213.56s]  Jesus.
[1216.63s -> 1219.33s]  While you're telling this I just this still somebody's house on
[1219.33s -> 1219.83s]  fire.
[1222.06s -> 1222.76s]  You still hear it.
[1222.76s -> 1225.66s]  It's it's it's like makes this whole conversation that much funnier
[1227.30s -> 1230.00s]  because I'm just not even we're apparently not even paying attention
[1230.00s -> 1232.20s]  to the fact that the room we're in is on fire.
[1233.10s -> 1234.60s]  Oh, no, my my room is all good.
[1234.60s -> 1235.70s]  I don't I don't hear it.
[1235.80s -> 1236.40s]  I don't hear a thing.
[1236.40s -> 1237.30s]  I hear crickets, man.
[1238.80s -> 1239.20s]  A minute.
[1239.88s -> 1241.18s]  Wait, wait, wait, walk.
[1241.28s -> 1241.88s]  Keep walking.
[1244.13s -> 1244.73s]  I'm walking.
[1244.73s -> 1247.69s]  Walk really close to me walking.
[1247.89s -> 1249.99s]  I'm in I'm I'm through you.
[1250.59s -> 1257.16s]  Okay, now walk backwards and go far away.
[1261.65s -> 1262.55s]  You're the fire alarm.
[1262.65s -> 1263.95s]  You're the fire alarm guy.
[1264.35s -> 1265.15s]  I'm the fire.
[1265.15s -> 1266.85s]  Oh, yeah, the fire alarm guy.
[1270.71s -> 1273.61s]  You have do you have like a like a pager like a ghost pager that's
[1273.61s -> 1274.31s]  going off.
[1274.61s -> 1276.25s]  I have nothing.
[1280.77s -> 1282.07s]  It's like one of those tools.
[1283.20s -> 1286.40s]  People are saying it's v-sync effects of voice chat.
[1287.75s -> 1289.25s]  No, no way.
[1292.12s -> 1294.32s]  V-sync effects on voice chat.
[1294.32s -> 1295.32s]  Isn't that a video thing?
[1296.58s -> 1297.58s]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[1301.52s -> 1303.62s]  It's your mic feedback probably.
[1304.32s -> 1305.12s]  Is it though?
[1306.22s -> 1306.42s]  All right.
[1306.42s -> 1308.42s]  Hold on if I walkie on shoulder.
[1308.42s -> 1309.92s]  I have a walkie talkie on my shoulder.
[1309.92s -> 1310.52s]  Hang on a minute.
[1310.62s -> 1312.72s]  I don't think if I was just gonna cut I was gonna cover my mic with
[1312.72s -> 1318.35s]  my hands and be like, okay, talk now walkie talkie.
[1319.15s -> 1323.26s]  I wish I could look left shoulder because I have to stare at the
[1323.26s -> 1323.66s]  board.
[1324.56s -> 1326.06s]  You do because I'm Mr.
[1326.06s -> 1326.56s]  Lobby.
[1326.56s -> 1328.06s]  I missed a guy that runs the lobby.
[1329.84s -> 1333.24s]  Oh, they want to get in a call like an actual call like discord
[1333.24s -> 1333.54s]  call.
[1335.84s -> 1338.34s]  That's gonna be tough because I'm sitting on my couch.
[1340.63s -> 1343.13s]  Like this headset is not set up for discord.
[1344.03s -> 1345.73s]  I wouldn't be able to like broadcast it.
[1350.41s -> 1352.11s]  I could relay what they're saying to you.
[1357.99s -> 1359.39s]  Vinnie stand up you bum.
[1360.22s -> 1363.32s]  I wish I was on VR on the couch right now so bad.
[1364.22s -> 1367.10s]  I know but you can't do sitting VR.
[1367.20s -> 1368.80s]  You become Goblin when you sit.
[1368.80s -> 1372.40s]  Hey, do you still hear the walkie talkie the fire alarm?
[1372.70s -> 1375.70s]  I do but it's I'm kind of used to it now and it's kind of just
[1375.70s -> 1378.40s]  there and I kind of if you turn it off, I'd probably miss it.
[1381.38s -> 1384.48s]  The proximity in game chat is way better than discord for this
[1384.48s -> 1385.68s]  as one of my chat members.
[1388.38s -> 1391.56s]  Look down on your left shoulder.
[1392.46s -> 1394.66s]  Somebody said that this game is meant to be played without
[1394.66s -> 1396.16s]  discord because it's proximity.
[1403.91s -> 1406.11s]  You cannot take it off walkie on left shoulder.
[1406.11s -> 1407.11s]  I promise you chat.
[1407.11s -> 1409.01s]  I'm grabbing I'm looking for walkie.
[1409.01s -> 1409.81s]  I can't find it.
[1410.81s -> 1413.11s]  Check it out radio does not work in the lobby.
[1414.31s -> 1416.31s]  It's inside your neck chat.
[1416.91s -> 1418.31s]  I swear to Christ escape.
[1420.18s -> 1420.78s]  Oh shit.
[1420.78s -> 1421.38s]  I can move.
[1422.64s -> 1423.84s]  Let me see if I can turn it off for you.
[1426.64s -> 1426.94s]  What's it?
[1426.94s -> 1428.24s]  What are you sitting on?
[1429.53s -> 1430.63s]  I'm not sitting anymore.
[1430.83s -> 1431.73s]  Why do you have a hula hoop?
[1432.99s -> 1434.09s]  Oh, that's we all have that.
[1434.09s -> 1435.79s]  That's our utility belt in VR.
[1437.28s -> 1443.14s]  You don't have one but that's I know.
[1443.74s -> 1445.34s]  Okay, I'm going to walk this way.
[1446.61s -> 1450.80s]  Is it something on the thought that was a gun?
[1450.80s -> 1451.90s]  I thought you just shot a gun at me.
[1456.49s -> 1460.79s]  It's just like trying to find a smoke detector that is running
[1460.79s -> 1461.39s]  at a battery.
[1462.39s -> 1463.99s]  It's like dude is it in the fucking wall?
[1463.99s -> 1465.19s]  Is it in the brick?
[1465.39s -> 1470.03s]  It's somebody a hundred years ago leave one in the wall when
[1470.03s -> 1470.63s]  they built the house.
[1473.46s -> 1474.96s]  Oh what you can do basketball.
[1481.38s -> 1482.58s]  I want not that fun.
[1483.28s -> 1486.11s]  It's more fun than it looks.
[1486.11s -> 1486.91s]  Yeah, let me try.
[1489.54s -> 1490.04s]  Oh, hey.
[1490.34s -> 1490.84s]  Ross.
[1493.66s -> 1499.20s]  So we can't actually verbally communicate if you can hear
[1499.20s -> 1506.76s]  me nod if you can hear me do this.
[1513.61s -> 1514.61s]  They can't hear you.
[1517.19s -> 1518.59s]  He's not getting your audio.
[1519.09s -> 1519.79s]  You can't hear me.
[1520.89s -> 1521.59s]  I can hear you.
[1521.59s -> 1522.59s]  Can you hear German?

[2165.18s -> 2166.68s]  Honestly, it's not bothering me.
[2167.08s -> 2168.38s]  It's pretty quiet now.
[2168.68s -> 2171.18s]  I've turned you down a bit, but I can still hear your voice.
[2171.48s -> 2172.38s]  No, I'm going to keep it on.
[2172.38s -> 2173.18s]  I think it's awesome.

[2184.00s -> 2185.10s]  Sounds like Mike issues.
[2185.10s -> 2187.50s]  There's a buzz in the background of your audio for some reason.
[2187.50s -> 2189.00s]  No, that's the in-game thing.
[2189.70s -> 2191.90s]  Vinny, you're running an index through your DAW.
[2191.90s -> 2192.80s]  No, that's clock.
[2192.80s -> 2193.90s]  That's only for chat.
[2194.00s -> 2197.20s]  I just turned my DAW off and it's still happening.
[2199.70s -> 2201.40s]  This is so much better than before.
[2202.72s -> 2203.12s]  Yeah.
[2205.19s -> 2207.09s]  Yeah, this is the weirdest fucking problem ever.
[2207.79s -> 2208.79s]  Do you have another Mike?
[2208.89s -> 2210.69s]  No, it's not that easy because headset.
[2210.69s -> 2211.79s]  All right, I give up.
[2211.79s -> 2213.59s]  Let's just want to find some dude.
[2214.39s -> 2215.39s]  Find some ghosts.
[2215.49s -> 2218.69s]  Well, you just like a bat using sonar, dude.
[2218.69s -> 2219.39s]  You're going to be fine.
[2220.19s -> 2222.79s]  It's such an interesting bizarre strange problem.
[2222.79s -> 2224.49s]  That's like hilariously strange.
[2225.49s -> 2225.89s]  Yeah.
[2226.79s -> 2227.09s]  All right.
[2227.09s -> 2228.39s]  Everyone grab a flashlight.
[2230.62s -> 2231.12s]  Okay.
[2232.22s -> 2233.42s]  Is there like a camera?
[2233.92s -> 2235.52s]  Yeah, by the way, I like this.
[2236.12s -> 2236.82s]  Oh, you got the camera.
[2236.82s -> 2237.42s]  There's two though.
[2237.42s -> 2238.22s]  Where's the other one?
[2238.82s -> 2239.72s]  Oh, I have the other one.
[2240.92s -> 2241.72s]  Oh, you got the other one.
[2241.72s -> 2242.22s]  Okay, cool.
[2242.22s -> 2242.52s]  Cool.
[2243.32s -> 2244.22s]  I will go naked.
[2245.32s -> 2246.02s]  That one.
[2246.22s -> 2247.12s]  What is this book for?
[2247.12s -> 2248.62s]  Because we've got the journal in our head.
[2248.72s -> 2250.52s]  This is the one where the ghosts, right?
[2251.32s -> 2255.42s]  The ghost right in that like for their diary ghost writers.
[2256.70s -> 2261.34s]  Then we have all the videos or then am I still the default
[2261.34s -> 2262.14s]  player character?
[2263.04s -> 2266.04s]  No, you're the shaggy guy Caucasian man with blue eyes
[2266.04s -> 2266.84s]  and brown hair.
[2267.34s -> 2269.54s]  Yeah, my character choice didn't seem to take but that's
[2269.54s -> 2269.94s]  okay.
[2273.42s -> 2274.02s]  All right, so
[2277.86s -> 2278.46s]  that makes sense.
[2278.96s -> 2279.86s]  What did it say?
[2279.86s -> 2280.96s]  The ghost was flashlight.
[2283.06s -> 2284.56s]  Wait, do you have all the flashlights?
[2285.36s -> 2286.56s]  Yeah, I don't have a flashlight.
[2286.56s -> 2286.96s]  How did I?
[2286.96s -> 2288.36s]  There's a little what you do.
[2288.66s -> 2290.76s]  There's a tiny flashlight and there's a big flashlight.
[2290.86s -> 2292.16s]  You have the big flashlight.
[2292.86s -> 2293.26s]  Who's this?
[2293.26s -> 2293.66s]  Oh, I can.
[2293.66s -> 2294.16s]  This is me.
[2294.16s -> 2295.96s]  That's that's Germany.

[2298.06s -> 2299.46s]  Yeah, just knocked my helmet.
[2300.26s -> 2301.36s]  Oh, I sounded like you.

[2306.66s -> 2308.66s]  Yeah, just like that other game.
[2308.86s -> 2309.66s]  Did anybody get the key?
[2309.76s -> 2310.56s]  Dungeon night.
[2311.16s -> 2311.96s]  Oh, was there a key?
[2311.96s -> 2312.76s]  Oh, we got the key.
[2313.06s -> 2313.86s]  Yeah, I grabbed it.
[2315.00s -> 2316.10s]  Yo, anybody home?
[2317.10s -> 2318.20s]  Another person in the house.
[2318.70s -> 2320.50s]  Wait, did I just see something floating?
[2321.30s -> 2322.40s]  So, okay.
[2322.60s -> 2323.60s]  I know how to do this.
[2326.90s -> 2328.00s]  Who has the
[2329.33s -> 2332.23s]  the thing that lights up the ping-ping green?
[2332.33s -> 2333.43s]  I got I think I do.
[2334.03s -> 2335.13s]  Was I supposed to bring that?
[2335.13s -> 2336.43s]  Yeah, so I got it.
[2336.73s -> 2338.13s]  Let's follow the dinner plate.
[2338.83s -> 2340.53s]  Wait guys, I think there was actually another thing.
[2340.73s -> 2341.83s]  Who got the white thing?
[2342.77s -> 2343.17s]  I do.
[2343.77s -> 2344.47s]  You got the white thing.
[2344.47s -> 2345.17s]  This is the EMF.
[2345.17s -> 2345.57s]  Yeah.
[2346.37s -> 2347.87s]  Okay, I've got a dinner plate.
[2349.22s -> 2351.02s]  So, we'll follow Kiwi to start.
[2351.12s -> 2352.52s]  You smashed that over somebody's head?
[2354.11s -> 2355.31s]  I mean, I'm thinking about it.
[2356.31s -> 2357.01s]  It's kind of side-tracked.
[2357.01s -> 2357.71s]  Borslem can really cut.
[2359.90s -> 2362.10s]  Yeah, let's wait till we see the ghost to smash any dinner
[2362.10s -> 2362.60s]  plates.
[2362.70s -> 2363.60s]  Burglar alarm.
[2365.28s -> 2366.08s]  So, Kiwi,
[2366.48s -> 2367.58s]  I guess we'll follow you.
[2367.58s -> 2369.88s]  When you get activity, let us know and then we'll set the
[2369.88s -> 2371.88s]  book down and we'll ask the spooky questions.
[2372.08s -> 2372.58s]  Okay.
[2372.58s -> 2373.88s]  Oh, yeah, I like the sound of that.
[2374.18s -> 2375.48s]  How do I turn on my flashlight?
[2375.68s -> 2376.38s]  It's pretty dark.
[2376.38s -> 2378.08s]  You use the trigger, the right trigger.
[2378.38s -> 2379.08s]  I think we have to pick it.
[2379.08s -> 2380.28s]  Is there a certain room, right?
[2380.28s -> 2381.68s]  You got a flashlight on your shoulder.
[2381.68s -> 2382.28s]  How did you do that?
[2382.28s -> 2383.98s]  Yeah, but it's not illuminating.
[2384.28s -> 2385.08s]  It doesn't illuminate anything.
[2385.08s -> 2386.58s]  It's like an area flashlight.
[2386.98s -> 2387.28s]  Okay.
[2387.28s -> 2388.58s]  How did you guys turn that on?
[2388.58s -> 2388.88s]  I don't have anything.
[2388.88s -> 2390.88s]  So, I'll follow whoever has the flashlight.
[2390.98s -> 2391.28s]  The big one.
[2391.28s -> 2391.98s]  Well, I don't have anything.
[2392.78s -> 2393.68s]  How did you guys do that?
[2393.78s -> 2394.58s]  It's pretty pitch dark.
[2394.58s -> 2395.48s]  Where's the ghost?
[2397.20s -> 2398.90s]  So, Kiwi will lead us to the ghost.
[2399.30s -> 2399.80s]  Oh, okay.
[2400.99s -> 2403.19s]  Using the Pee Pee.
[2403.79s -> 2404.79s]  Using the Pee Pee?
[2405.89s -> 2406.69s]  What about the Pee Pee?
[2407.09s -> 2407.89s]  The Pee Pee Vee?
[2409.49s -> 2411.89s]  It's like a device that...
[2411.99s -> 2412.49s]  Oh, yeah.
[2412.49s -> 2414.09s]  ...texts ghost activity.
[2414.59s -> 2416.19s]  I want you to smudge stick.
[2416.69s -> 2417.09s]  Okay.
[2418.00s -> 2418.40s]  Okay.
[2419.96s -> 2422.06s]  I have the camera, by the way, if you want to set it up in one of these rooms.
[2423.26s -> 2428.66s]  I think we should find some paranormal activity before we set the camera down.
[2429.36s -> 2430.06s]  Hello.
[2430.36s -> 2431.66s]  Is there anybody here?
[2434.34s -> 2434.94s]  Oh, shit.
[2435.34s -> 2436.24s]  What was that noise?
[2436.24s -> 2437.74s]  I guess my flashlight just went out on its own.
[2438.74s -> 2440.54s]  Oh, I think that's a sign.
[2441.44s -> 2442.24s]  Wait, did it respond?
[2442.54s -> 2444.98s]  Is anybody here?
[2445.76s -> 2446.26s]  Hello?
[2447.51s -> 2448.41s]  What is your name?
[2449.60s -> 2451.00s]  Can you give us a sign?
[2451.30s -> 2452.60s]  Can you give us a sign?
[2452.70s -> 2455.50s]  What data center are you mining this from, developers?
[2457.65s -> 2459.15s]  What are you going to do with our recording?
[2459.15s -> 2459.85s]  Jesus, Vinny.
[2461.30s -> 2462.10s]  It's okay, Vinny.
[2462.50s -> 2463.80s]  Oh, what room is this?
[2463.80s -> 2464.70s]  This is the bathroom.
[2465.20s -> 2466.40s]  Guys, we don't have a reflection.
[2467.60s -> 2468.20s]  That's Vinny.
[2468.60s -> 2469.90s]  This is the spirit box.
[2470.40s -> 2471.90s]  Guys, I'm going to wash the dishes.
[2472.78s -> 2473.68s]  Wash the dishes.
[2475.82s -> 2476.12s]  Oh, God.
[2476.12s -> 2476.82s]  What's going on?
[2476.92s -> 2477.62s]  You're in the wall.
[2478.22s -> 2480.82s]  Traditionally, you're not supposed to wash dishes in them guys.
[2481.62s -> 2483.12s]  I think I went through the wall.
[2483.12s -> 2484.12s]  That's fucking weird.
[2484.42s -> 2485.62s]  Can you return to us?
[2486.92s -> 2488.72s]  Guys, I don't know.
[2488.72s -> 2489.42s]  Where are you?
[2489.52s -> 2490.52s]  Wait, did you actually just?
[2490.62s -> 2492.32s]  I have like teeth.
[2493.42s -> 2494.12s]  That was scary.
[2494.22s -> 2495.42s]  That was scary than a ghost.
[2495.42s -> 2496.62s]  I saw inside of his brain.
[2497.83s -> 2498.53s]  What is going on?
[2498.53s -> 2499.93s]  I think I teleported.
[2500.33s -> 2501.63s]  Is there anybody here?
[2502.33s -> 2503.53s]  Guys, can someone come get me?
[2503.53s -> 2504.63s]  I'm a little scared.
[2504.83s -> 2505.23s]  Where are you?
[2505.23s -> 2506.23s]  Give us a sign.
[2506.63s -> 2507.93s]  I'm downstairs.
[2508.03s -> 2510.63s]  We might have a ghost downstairs and not upstairs.
[2510.63s -> 2512.23s]  Yeah, we can just turn the lights on guys.
[2512.23s -> 2513.13s]  What the hell are we doing?
[2513.13s -> 2514.23s]  Guys, I'm downstairs.
[2514.23s -> 2514.63s]  Oh, what?
[2514.83s -> 2515.33s]  Yeah, that's right.
[2515.33s -> 2517.13s]  Well, the ghost won't talk to us.
[2517.33s -> 2518.83s]  Oh, can you guys come find me?
[2518.83s -> 2519.33s]  Is there anybody in this room?
[2519.73s -> 2520.53s]  Oh, that's helpful.
[2521.23s -> 2522.03s]  That's actually really nice.
[2522.03s -> 2522.63s]  Guys, I went through a wall.
[2522.63s -> 2523.73s]  I think I'm the ghost.
[2524.23s -> 2525.23s]  I think Ross is dead.
[2525.23s -> 2527.43s]  If you can hear me, let me know.
[2527.43s -> 2528.63s]  Ross, are you dead?
[2530.23s -> 2531.03s]  You can die?
[2531.43s -> 2532.63s]  Chat, am I dead?
[2534.13s -> 2534.93s]  Did someone...
[2536.24s -> 2537.14s]  What is that noise?
[2537.44s -> 2537.94s]  Maybe.
[2537.94s -> 2539.24s]  Oh, that's a spirit box.
[2539.74s -> 2541.94s]  I'm going to try to clip through the wall to find you.
[2542.14s -> 2543.84s]  I think somebody stays.
[2543.84s -> 2544.64s]  Somebody stays.
[2544.84s -> 2547.54s]  I got a video camera from what I read in the tutorial.
[2547.74s -> 2548.24s]  Oh, wait.
[2548.24s -> 2549.44s]  Put the camera down in a room.
[2549.74s -> 2550.74s]  Somebody checks the TV.
[2550.74s -> 2554.04s]  My black light has found some schmutz on this mirror.
[2554.04s -> 2554.64s]  Oh, there is.
[2554.64s -> 2557.54s]  I'm just going to curl up into a ball on the floor and just scream.
[2558.04s -> 2559.44s]  At least it does light up.
[2562.02s -> 2562.82s]  I want to go find him.
[2565.43s -> 2566.53s]  I got an idea.
[2566.53s -> 2567.83s]  I'm going to put this camera down right here.
[2567.83s -> 2568.53s]  Check this out.
[2570.53s -> 2572.03s]  I'm going to put the camera right here.
[2572.03s -> 2573.53s]  Guys, we have five minutes.
[2573.53s -> 2574.83s]  We have five minutes before this.
[2574.83s -> 2575.83s]  You have five minutes?
[2576.63s -> 2577.73s]  Can you guys come find me?
[2577.73s -> 2578.43s]  I'm scared.
[2578.43s -> 2579.23s]  I'm alone.
[2579.63s -> 2582.23s]  Well, maybe you should have not split from the group.
[2584.63s -> 2586.23s]  Can anybody get in the truck and look at the TV?
[2586.23s -> 2586.93s]  What's going on?
[2587.43s -> 2587.93s]  Turn this off.
[2587.93s -> 2589.13s]  I got a camera in here.
[2589.93s -> 2590.93s]  But we don't know.
[2590.93s -> 2592.03s]  We got to find the room.
[2592.63s -> 2593.23s]  I'm stuck.
[2593.43s -> 2598.33s]  We got to find the room where the ghosts so so Kiwi your your meter
[2598.33s -> 2600.73s]  should light up and that's where it hasn't lit up.
[2601.03s -> 2604.23s]  Okay, so let's go downstairs and find old B for walkie-talkie.
[2610.06s -> 2610.66s]  Can you guys hear me?
[2610.66s -> 2611.76s]  Hold B and talk.
[2612.94s -> 2613.34s]  Yeah.
[2616.80s -> 2617.80s]  It's a walkie-talkie.
[2618.80s -> 2621.86s]  Can you hear us Ross Ross?
[2621.86s -> 2625.16s]  Hello Ross.
[2628.91s -> 2629.61s]  Where are you?
[2631.35s -> 2632.55s]  Oh, I lost the flashlight.
[2633.15s -> 2634.45s]  What is this game?
[2636.29s -> 2638.79s]  Turn on the light Ross.
[2638.79s -> 2640.49s]  Can you hear me on the walkie-talkie?
[2640.89s -> 2642.89s]  Go look at the TV in the truck.
[2647.42s -> 2649.52s]  I set up a camera put on night vision and see if there's anything
[2649.52s -> 2649.92s]  in there.
[2652.71s -> 2653.81s]  Yeah, look for orbs.
[2654.11s -> 2655.71s]  Wait, how are you guys using the walkie-talkie?
[2660.38s -> 2661.38s]  Is this walkie-talkie?
[2661.58s -> 2662.58s]  Yeah, that sounds like you.
[2663.88s -> 2666.18s]  Okay, Ross.
[2666.18s -> 2666.78s]  Can you hear me?
[2667.75s -> 2669.75s]  You can just hear him in the truck talking.
[2670.55s -> 2672.85s]  So Ross, if you want to talk to us through the walkie-talkie,
[2672.85s -> 2673.45s]  here's what you do.
[2673.45s -> 2675.95s]  Reach over your left shoulder and pull the trigger.
[2678.35s -> 2680.95s]  This is like when you hear your neighbor and like talking
[2680.95s -> 2682.45s]  through the wall in an apartment.
[2683.71s -> 2686.01s]  Reach over your left shoulder and pull the trigger.
[2687.34s -> 2688.44s]  Can you guys hear me?
[2689.04s -> 2690.04s]  Yeah, Ross.
[2694.56s -> 2696.76s]  The front, I don't think it's the right camera.
[2696.76s -> 2697.06s]  Hold on.
[2697.06s -> 2697.96s]  Let me change camera.
[2698.26s -> 2699.66s]  Okay, now I see a bedroom.
[2700.56s -> 2702.46s]  That's yeah, I set the camera up in there.
[2703.66s -> 2703.86s]  Yeah.
[2703.86s -> 2704.26s]  All right.
[2704.26s -> 2706.16s]  I see the two pillows.
[2706.16s -> 2710.83s]  They look secure on the wall.
[2711.43s -> 2712.83s]  I don't see anything spooky.
[2714.83s -> 2716.43s]  What's the timer say in the truck?
[2716.43s -> 2718.06s]  Like how much time do we have?
[2718.56s -> 2721.39s]  Yeah, there's no time left.
[2721.89s -> 2723.29s]  Oh, we mean no time left.
[2724.06s -> 2725.46s]  Yeah, you pissed off the ghost.
[2725.96s -> 2732.14s]  We either haul and have to find the ghost.
[2732.14s -> 2733.94s]  I think we may have did this out of order.
[2735.62s -> 2736.92s]  We gotta go downstairs.
[2737.72s -> 2738.52s]  All right, let's go.
[2741.51s -> 2742.81s]  Ghost, are you here?
[2745.52s -> 2746.52s]  Give us a sign.
[2757.92s -> 2758.72s]  Give me a sign.
[2758.72s -> 2777.44s]  The right person is there.
[2777.94s -> 2782.16s]  Okay, make noise.
[2782.93s -> 2783.83s]  Ghost, are you here?
[2784.53s -> 2785.53s]  We have a ghost.
[2786.33s -> 2787.33s]  Give us a sign.
[2787.43s -> 2789.43s]  Check your PKE meter.
[2793.43s -> 2794.83s]  Ross, check the readings.
[2796.03s -> 2799.54s]  The readivity?
[2800.44s -> 2800.84s]  Right.
[2801.54s -> 2804.70s]  It's our black light.
[2804.70s -> 2805.60s]  Hey, where are you going?
[2805.60s -> 2806.40s]  I hear some noises.
[2806.40s -> 2807.00s]  I hear it too.
[2811.76s -> 2812.56s]  I'm upstairs.
[2813.57s -> 2814.07s]  That was me.
[2814.57s -> 2815.37s]  Okay, so...
[2824.22s -> 2829.35s]  Something's in this fucking house, dude.
[2829.35s -> 2830.25s]  Something's in this house.
[2838.28s -> 2841.58s]  My name is not important to you.
[2845.60s -> 2846.10s]  What'd he say?
[2861.91s -> 2862.71s]  Where are you guys?
[2866.07s -> 2866.87s]  Where is everybody?
[2873.35s -> 2874.05s]  Where is that?
[2883.41s -> 2885.11s]  We're gonna go see Mr. Plinkett.
[2885.11s -> 2885.61s]  Sorry.
[2885.91s -> 2887.21s]  That's a YouTuber.
[2887.21s -> 2888.21s]  Don't worry about it.
[2888.21s -> 2888.71s]  Oh, fuck.
[2888.71s -> 2889.31s]  I don't know.
[2889.31s -> 2890.81s]  Wait, is somebody a YouTuber?
[2891.51s -> 2892.31s]  It's a good joke.
[2892.71s -> 2893.11s]  May I?
[2893.71s -> 2894.91s]  Or you can point down.
[2894.91s -> 2896.51s]  Are there any ghosts in here?
[2896.91s -> 2899.39s]  Hello?
[2899.39s -> 2901.29s]  I don't think ghosts usually have a name, though.
[2901.29s -> 2902.49s]  Spooky Spockers.
[2902.49s -> 2903.39s]  We hear ghosts.
[2903.79s -> 2905.09s]  Hello?
[2905.59s -> 2907.09s]  Is there spooky ghosts in here?
[2907.49s -> 2909.89s]  How old are you?
[2913.38s -> 2915.68s]  Phantasmal Spirit ASL.
[2915.88s -> 2918.78s]  We gotta find the light switch so we don't...
[2919.28s -> 2920.48s]  Give us a sign.
[2921.74s -> 2923.04s]  Give us a sign.
[2923.04s -> 2924.34s]  You're the piano man.
[2929.84s -> 2930.64s]  He chimes in.
[2930.64s -> 2932.94s]  I'm not really sure how it goes.
[2933.44s -> 2934.34s]  Oh shit, I've been caught.
[2938.08s -> 2940.99s]  Guys, what's this button?
[2941.89s -> 2944.09s]  Guys, I found a button and it just made it go green.
[2944.89s -> 2945.69s]  Wow.
[2945.69s -> 2947.29s]  What do you need my flashlight for, Vinny?
[2949.59s -> 2951.09s]  Who made PT on floor?
[2951.49s -> 2952.69s]  Ewie, was it you?
[2953.49s -> 2954.39s]  I'm a little scared.
[2954.39s -> 2955.59s]  I'm gonna level with you.
[2957.59s -> 2959.09s]  It's been green this whole time.
[2959.89s -> 2962.89s]  I don't know if I'm using it wrong, but so far nothing.
[2963.76s -> 2965.56s]  I think he might be in the kitchen, guys.
[2966.36s -> 2968.16s]  You're supposed to say ghost's name.
[2968.16s -> 2968.96s]  It's limited.
[2969.06s -> 2970.96s]  It's written on the wall in the...
[2971.66s -> 2972.16s]  Guys.
[2972.16s -> 2973.66s]  We didn't learn his name, that was rude.
[2973.66s -> 2975.96s]  Why does the manual say a survivor's guide?
[2975.96s -> 2977.46s]  Is there a chance we could die?
[2977.86s -> 2980.36s]  The ghost isn't killing us or anything.
[2981.56s -> 2984.09s]  Oh, hey, this ghost sucks.
[2986.90s -> 2990.00s]  Here I am, just walking around by myself in the fucking basement.
[2990.90s -> 2993.00s]  This ghost is a piece of shit.
[2997.38s -> 2998.48s]  Ready, lame ghost.
[3006.42s -> 3007.72s]  All of a sudden my neck just goes...
[3010.74s -> 3012.74s]  The air conditioning in this place must be really loud.
[3012.74s -> 3014.54s]  It gets so much louder when you step in.
[3015.04s -> 3017.54s]  They shouldn't be running AC in a dead person's house.
[3020.64s -> 3021.14s]  Info?
[3035.61s -> 3036.11s]  Lone.
[3041.34s -> 3042.64s]  Me, oh me, me, me, me.
[3052.47s -> 3053.87s]  I think the camera's in the bedroom.
[3056.10s -> 3056.90s]  Camera's in the bedroom.
[3065.56s -> 3066.26s]  Why can't I get jumped?
[3077.79s -> 3078.29s]  Steven...
[3079.29s -> 3080.39s]  Steven Johnson.
[3083.66s -> 3086.36s]  Steven Johnson, I know you're here.
[3090.48s -> 3092.08s]  Steven Johnson, I know you're here.
[3102.69s -> 3103.19s]  I think...
[3103.93s -> 3105.23s]  I think somebody scammed us.
[3105.23s -> 3108.23s]  And just, they just went on vacation and told us the place was haunted.
[3108.23s -> 3110.83s]  And they, they had, we had to pay like ten grand to do this.
[3125.33s -> 3126.53s]  Congealy man?
[3128.63s -> 3130.33s]  Yeah, I forgot where the bedroom was.
[3130.33s -> 3131.33s]  It's a pretty large house.
[3131.43s -> 3131.93s]  Over.
[3149.69s -> 3150.39s]  I got the camera.
[3157.06s -> 3158.26s]  I got it, I got a camera.
[3162.46s -> 3163.56s]  Yes, I will turn it on.
[3165.37s -> 3165.87s]  You see?
[3178.46s -> 3181.26s]  Oh, I can, I can do a camera light.
[3186.19s -> 3187.59s]  Okay, I got the camera.
[3187.59s -> 3188.29s]  Where do you want me to go?
[3188.39s -> 3191.79s]  Where's the guy, where's the guy with the big balls supposed to go?
[3204.62s -> 3205.42s]  Hey, somebody walking.
[3212.98s -> 3214.28s]  Steven Johnson, Steven Johnson's behind me.
[3214.28s -> 3215.08s]  Steven Johnson's behind me.
[3215.08s -> 3216.08s]  Steven Johnson's behind me.
[3216.18s -> 3217.08s]  Steven Johnson's behind me.
[3218.74s -> 3219.24s]  I'm upstairs.
[3219.24s -> 3220.24s]  Steven Johnson's probably gonna kill me.
[3220.24s -> 3220.84s]  I have the camera.
[3223.36s -> 3224.96s]  I can hear you, but I think somebody's behind me.
[3225.26s -> 3251.43s]  Oh, that's a, no, you're just sitting.
[3251.93s -> 3253.43s]  You're sitting, seated Vinny.
[3253.83s -> 3254.83s]  It's seated Vinny.
[3254.93s -> 3256.13s]  You are a monster.
[3259.81s -> 3260.61s]  Steven Johnson.
[3267.78s -> 3269.38s]  I'm trying to get out of the house.
[3272.75s -> 3274.55s]  Let's head, hightail it out of here.
[3275.65s -> 3276.15s]  Hey guys.
[3279.61s -> 3281.51s]  I really, you're all pretty close to death.
[3283.11s -> 3284.21s]  Especially Jerma.
[3284.91s -> 3288.81s]  If we look at the, the, the readout here, Jerma was about to die.
[3290.01s -> 3291.11s]  He's at 18%.
[3291.41s -> 3293.01s]  Actually, wow, this one really hates Jerma.
[3293.01s -> 3294.31s]  It's going specifically for you.
[3294.31s -> 3294.91s]  I'm fine.
[3294.91s -> 3295.91s]  Where were you Jerma?
[3296.21s -> 3298.61s]  Just throw me back in there and like just wait till I get eaten and
[3298.61s -> 3301.11s]  then take a few pictures and then send it to the fucking National Geographic.
[3301.11s -> 3302.01s]  You guys are millionaires.
[3303.51s -> 3305.81s]  All I ask is you build a giant statue in my name.
[3306.61s -> 3308.71s]  But if a ghost takes the picture, you're gonna have a lawsuit.
[3309.81s -> 3313.11s]  So we can, we can use some of the evidence that we found already.
[3314.31s -> 3319.01s]  Because this thing going to five means that it's, that limits it.
[3319.85s -> 3320.35s]  Oh, okay.
[3320.35s -> 3321.95s]  So do we, do we have, we have evidence?
[3323.95s -> 3326.95s]  So EMF level five is considered evidence.
[3327.35s -> 3328.35s]  So we can put that in.
[3333.11s -> 3335.61s]  Did the spirit box go off at any point Vinny?
[3337.25s -> 3337.65s]  Okay.
[3340.42s -> 3341.82s]  Did anyone see any fingerprints?
[3341.82s -> 3344.02s]  I don't think bathroom mirror schmutz counts.
[3346.72s -> 3347.42s]  No one saw it.
[3347.42s -> 3349.82s]  Did you see a ghost orb on any cameras Ross?
[3353.49s -> 3353.89s]  All right.
[3353.89s -> 3354.79s]  No orbs.
[3355.49s -> 3357.89s]  Did anyone see any ghost writing in the ghost book?
[3358.89s -> 3359.79s]  I don't think there's any writing.
[3361.00s -> 3361.30s]  All right.
[3361.30s -> 3365.74s]  Let's bring the ghost book in there and the did anyone see their breath
[3365.74s -> 3368.04s]  or free have freezing temperatures happen?
[3368.04s -> 3369.44s]  I don't have freezing breath this time.
[3370.54s -> 3370.94s]  Okay.
[3370.94s -> 3371.24s]  I'll go.
[3371.24s -> 3373.62s]  So I'll do it.
[3373.62s -> 3374.92s]  Well, who's got the highest sanity?
[3375.72s -> 3377.62s]  I shouldn't accept me because I'm scared.
[3379.82s -> 3380.92s]  Where is the ghost book?
[3380.92s -> 3381.72s]  What happened to it?
[3383.52s -> 3384.32s]  I don't know.
[3384.82s -> 3386.52s]  Is anyone moving the camera?
[3386.92s -> 3387.42s]  Oh, it's here.
[3387.42s -> 3389.02s]  Vinny has it on his eye.
[3389.02s -> 3390.42s]  I got the camera right here.
[3390.42s -> 3391.52s]  Digital photo camera.
[3392.02s -> 3393.62s]  Why does Vinny something muffled now?
[3393.62s -> 3395.02s]  Does anybody else hear this?
[3397.32s -> 3399.61s]  Yeah, I got the video.
[3399.61s -> 3400.51s]  This is a video camera.
[3400.61s -> 3401.91s]  There's nothing written in that book now.
[3402.71s -> 3404.11s]  Your voice is really muffled.
[3404.11s -> 3405.21s]  You're yours is too.
[3406.01s -> 3407.91s]  Really must be an audio bug then.
[3408.71s -> 3409.71s]  Let's German.
[3409.71s -> 3412.31s]  What room were you in when your sanity was going down like crazy
[3412.31s -> 3413.41s]  and you saw what's his face?
[3414.11s -> 3415.51s]  I don't even know.
[3415.51s -> 3417.61s]  I might just be like placebo affecting myself.
[3417.61s -> 3419.61s]  I thought I saw a guy on my left when I was walking in the
[3419.61s -> 3420.41s]  hallway upstairs.
[3421.21s -> 3422.91s]  Well, your sanity was the lowest.
[3422.91s -> 3424.11s]  So it would make sense.
[3424.71s -> 3425.31s]  Yeah, did we see it?
[3425.31s -> 3426.81s]  Was there a guy on the left side of the screen?
[3427.21s -> 3428.21s]  German, can you hear me?
[3428.41s -> 3430.31s]  I didn't see a guy but I was downstairs.
[3431.11s -> 3433.46s]  German, I'm going in.
[3433.86s -> 3434.26s]  Going in?
[3435.43s -> 3436.03s]  You going in?
[3437.13s -> 3438.13s]  You gonna bring the diary?
[3438.23s -> 3438.93s]  There's a bathroom.
[3440.93s -> 3441.63s]  Check the bathroom.
[3441.63s -> 3443.53s]  Check the upstairs bathroom, Vinny.
[3444.43s -> 3445.23s]  Give me the camera.
[3445.63s -> 3446.43s]  I'm going to take the camera.
[3446.43s -> 3447.13s]  You got the camera?
[3448.79s -> 3449.49s]  All alone?
[3450.09s -> 3451.49s]  Yeah, you can watch the camera.
[3451.59s -> 3454.89s]  He doesn't respond to people who, you know, who's got the
[3454.89s -> 3455.49s]  other camera.
[3455.59s -> 3456.19s]  Not that one.
[3457.40s -> 3458.40s]  Oh, that's a still camera.
[3459.00s -> 3460.40s]  This is the money camera.
[3460.50s -> 3462.20s]  We get money for taking snapshots.
[3462.70s -> 3464.80s]  Ross, I see you took a selfie on it.
[3464.80s -> 3466.40s]  That's the video camera.
[3466.40s -> 3467.10s]  I got it here.
[3467.20s -> 3467.80s]  Was that me?
[3467.80s -> 3468.40s]  Let me grab that.
[3468.70s -> 3469.20s]  Oh, right.
[3469.20s -> 3470.10s]  You're on VR.
[3470.10s -> 3470.60s]  I forgot.
[3471.00s -> 3471.30s]  Sorry.
[3471.30s -> 3472.10s]  Yeah, I got that.
[3472.10s -> 3472.60s]  I got that.
[3473.10s -> 3473.70s]  You got it all?
[3474.00s -> 3474.90s]  I'll be right back.
[3477.64s -> 3477.84s]  All right.
[3477.84s -> 3478.24s]  Let's do it.
[3478.24s -> 3479.04s]  What about the camera?
[3480.74s -> 3481.54s]  I think he's got it.
[3482.24s -> 3484.54s]  Unless someone wants to go in with the snapshot camera and
[3484.54s -> 3485.94s]  take some some snappies.
[3485.94s -> 3486.94s]  No, I'm good.
[3486.94s -> 3487.84s]  I don't want to do that.
[3487.84s -> 3488.44s]  I'll take it.
[3489.54s -> 3489.84s]  All right.
[3489.84s -> 3490.24s]  Do it.
[3490.44s -> 3492.74s]  The more snapshots you get of ghosts, the more money we
[3492.74s -> 3493.14s]  get.
[3493.14s -> 3494.24s]  Oh, shit.
[3494.24s -> 3496.24s]  No more film in that camera, Roger.
[3496.24s -> 3499.02s]  I snapped all the photos.
[3499.02s -> 3500.02s]  There's no more film?
[3500.02s -> 3501.02s]  Oh, well shit.
[3501.12s -> 3501.82s]  Wait, dude.
[3501.82s -> 3504.12s]  Are you do you have the the camera on right now?
[3504.22s -> 3505.02s]  Yeah, right click.
[3505.12s -> 3506.12s]  No, that you're on VR.
[3506.12s -> 3507.02s]  You're in the fun mode.
[3507.12s -> 3507.52s]  Yeah.
[3507.52s -> 3507.72s]  Yeah.
[3508.72s -> 3509.02s]  Okay.
[3509.02s -> 3509.42s]  Yeah.
[3509.42s -> 3511.82s]  Vinny, Vinny, we see we see you.
[3512.62s -> 3516.08s]  You need to use Vinny.
[3516.08s -> 3524.76s]  We see you.
[3524.86s -> 3525.66s]  Should we fuck with him?
[3534.94s -> 3536.44s]  Vinny, you left the camera on the counter.
[3540.76s -> 3542.16s]  Take that into the upstairs bathroom.
[3542.36s -> 3543.96s]  Yeah, you might want to bring that with you, dude.
[3543.96s -> 3544.66s]  Bring us with you.
[3546.72s -> 3548.82s]  Yeah, if you if you can have the flashlight at the same
[3548.82s -> 3549.62s]  time, but it blinks.
[3554.30s -> 3556.30s]  Oh, we're all just total fucking what's this here, huh?
[3557.20s -> 3558.20s]  Yeah, we're bitches.
[3558.40s -> 3559.80s]  Hey Vinny, go that way.
[3562.25s -> 3563.45s]  Vinny, you dropped the camera.
[3564.09s -> 3564.69s]  Is he dead?
[3565.86s -> 3566.46s]  Vinny.
[3566.46s -> 3567.16s]  Oh, no.
[3569.33s -> 3570.43s]  Dude, he's dead.
[3570.83s -> 3571.83s]  Look at his sanity.
[3572.63s -> 3574.83s]  He's fucking he's fucking dead.
[3575.33s -> 3576.33s]  That's why he dropped.
[3577.00s -> 3579.20s]  Okay, let's make an educated guess because I don't really
[3579.20s -> 3581.30s]  want to know coward.
[3581.30s -> 3583.00s]  I'm going to go hit him in the head with the radio.
[3583.00s -> 3585.70s]  Like are you hearing the radio going to dark right now?
[3586.70s -> 3587.90s]  I think it's horrible.
[3587.90s -> 3588.80s]  Scary noise.
[3590.34s -> 3591.84s]  Is that actually real?
[3592.24s -> 3593.14s]  Is that the game?
[3593.94s -> 3594.64s]  Not for me.
[3596.14s -> 3597.24s]  Oh, yeah, now I hear it.
[3597.24s -> 3598.34s]  It's it's German.
[3598.34s -> 3598.84s]  It's mine.
[3598.84s -> 3599.34s]  It's me.
[3600.34s -> 3602.04s]  So wait, he just died in there.
[3602.54s -> 3603.64s]  He's fucking dead.
[3603.94s -> 3604.54s]  He's dead.
[3604.74s -> 3605.44s]  Where's the camera?
[3606.44s -> 3607.54s]  Watch on you.
[3607.74s -> 3608.34s]  You keep watching.
[3608.34s -> 3609.64s]  I'm going to open up.
[3609.84s -> 3611.04s]  I'm going to run in and run out.
[3612.27s -> 3613.17s]  This is my job.
[3614.78s -> 3616.38s]  I want to be in communication the whole time.
[3619.20s -> 3619.60s]  Okay.
[3624.19s -> 3625.29s]  Yeah, I'm going to watch the camera.
[3625.29s -> 3627.49s]  I think this is the dining room.
[3628.19s -> 3629.39s]  I think it's right in the front door, right?
[3634.34s -> 3634.74s]  All right.
[3635.99s -> 3637.09s]  It's pitch black in there.
[3637.09s -> 3638.29s]  He's dropping real quick.
[3638.29s -> 3640.09s]  Actually, I think we need to get out of here.
[3641.72s -> 3643.32s]  I'm in constant communication with you.
[3644.02s -> 3647.82s]  Do you see me on the on the I need to flip of light that
[3647.82s -> 3648.72s]  will give us some sanity.
[3650.54s -> 3651.24s]  Oh shit.
[3651.24s -> 3653.64s]  I'm in a dream to say you tell you in a dream when you
[3653.64s -> 3654.34s]  flip a light switch.
[3654.34s -> 3656.04s]  It doesn't work when you flip a light switch and it doesn't
[3656.04s -> 3656.44s]  work.
[3656.44s -> 3657.44s]  That's how you can tell you're dreaming.
[3657.44s -> 3658.54s]  That's how you start lucid dreaming.
[3660.31s -> 3662.41s]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[3662.41s -> 3670.37s]  I think actually, yeah, I think he's dropping really fast.
[3670.37s -> 3672.07s]  Jeremy, you're at 14%, dude.
[3672.87s -> 3673.17s]  All right.
[3673.97s -> 3675.67s]  I hear gas.
[3676.07s -> 3676.67s]  Where's gas?
[3676.67s -> 3677.37s]  We'll just gas.
[3680.00s -> 3680.70s]  I leave.
[3684.23s -> 3685.23s]  Maybe you should leave, dude.
[3685.23s -> 3687.63s]  You're nearing 10%.
[3689.01s -> 3689.51s]  Oh, okay.
[3689.51s -> 3690.11s]  I found the door.
[3692.17s -> 3693.37s]  Yeah, come to the front door.
[3696.96s -> 3698.16s]  Yo, do you have the ghost book?
[3699.60s -> 3702.10s]  No, I get the ghost radio.
[3703.36s -> 3703.96s]  I'm still using it.
[3703.96s -> 3705.56s]  That one's kind of tricky, I think.
[3707.50s -> 3709.00s]  Vinny's ghost was behind you.
[3709.20s -> 3710.20s]  Hey ghost.
[3711.32s -> 3712.12s]  Fuck you.
[3713.29s -> 3714.49s]  Wait, is Vinny still in the game?
[3716.25s -> 3717.65s]  He walks around as a spirit.
[3717.85s -> 3718.55s]  He does?
[3718.85s -> 3719.35s]  Oh really?
[3719.45s -> 3719.85s]  Yeah.
[3719.85s -> 3720.85s]  Yeah, he's a ghost now.
[3721.25s -> 3722.95s]  Vinny, show us where the flashlight is, man.
[3726.58s -> 3729.38s]  Everyone just stay back to back to back like the Spartans
[3729.38s -> 3729.68s]  did.
[3733.68s -> 3736.08s]  So apparently sanity will go down in the dark.
[3736.08s -> 3736.88s]  Where are we going?
[3737.58s -> 3738.68s]  We got to snap a picky.
[3738.98s -> 3740.18s]  Ross, get to the camera.
[3740.78s -> 3741.68s]  Well, is it down here?
[3741.68s -> 3742.68s]  There's something on the ground.
[3743.08s -> 3743.98s]  Guys, I found it.
[3744.28s -> 3745.28s]  There's a flashlight up here too.
[3758.00s -> 3759.10s]  No, no, I'm going to go.
[3759.10s -> 3762.50s]  I have like the wicked shitty from Walmart thing you plug
[3762.50s -> 3765.20s]  in on Halloween that does the cool thing outside shining
[3765.20s -> 3766.10s]  on the front of your house.
[3766.20s -> 3774.21s]  You're going to die?
[3783.42s -> 3784.52s]  None of the lights work.
[3793.19s -> 3794.19s]  Hey, something's coming through the radio.
[3795.36s -> 3796.66s]  In bedroom one.
[3797.26s -> 3798.76s]  Something's coming through the radio in bedroom one.
[3806.18s -> 3808.18s]  Before you die, you're 5% by the way.
[3809.88s -> 3814.76s]  It's saying it's saying I think it was the weather.
[3814.86s -> 3815.86s]  I really think it was the weather.
[3815.86s -> 3816.66s]  It was like sunny out.
[3822.46s -> 3822.96s]  You hear me?
[3830.72s -> 3831.52s]  I'm good, man.
[3831.52s -> 3837.40s]  I 1% I can live the car over here.
[3837.50s -> 3839.40s]  Yeah, but he's bouncing back from zero.
[3839.40s -> 3840.40s]  He keeps surviving.
[3841.80s -> 3842.70s]  I'm good, man.
[3847.57s -> 3847.87s]  Okay.
[3847.87s -> 3848.07s]  All right.
[3848.07s -> 3848.87s]  I'm coming back down.
[3852.12s -> 3856.16s]  I found Vinny.
[3856.16s -> 3857.16s]  I found Vinny's dead body.
[3865.20s -> 3867.10s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[3868.70s -> 3869.10s]  Nice.
[3869.30s -> 3871.10s]  Find any fingerprints or anything like that?
[3871.20s -> 3872.10s]  Yeah, they're everywhere.
[3872.20s -> 3873.40s]  They're all over the place upstairs.
[3874.38s -> 3875.88s]  Wait for this for real.
[3875.98s -> 3876.18s]  Yeah.
[3876.18s -> 3877.78s]  I mean like seriously they're all over the door handles
[3877.78s -> 3878.18s]  and everything.
[3878.18s -> 3878.38s]  Yeah.
[3878.48s -> 3878.88s]  Oh shit.
[3878.88s -> 3879.08s]  Yeah.
[3879.08s -> 3879.78s]  That's great.
[3879.78s -> 3880.18s]  Great.
[3880.38s -> 3882.18s]  We can probably guess from that.
[3882.88s -> 3883.18s]  Come on.
[3883.18s -> 3883.98s]  Let's get in the truck.
[3884.68s -> 3885.48s]  Let's get in the truck.
[3887.99s -> 3891.49s]  So what which one had which one said it needed we need to
[3891.59s -> 3893.39s]  he has massive plot armor.
[3901.10s -> 3905.80s]  So our other evidence is it was fingerprints all over the
[3905.80s -> 3910.17s]  door handles and we also got the spirit box to work as well.
[3910.17s -> 3910.67s]  Right?
[3911.37s -> 3912.77s]  Like it did some noise.
[3913.27s -> 3914.67s]  The radio was freaking out up there too.
[3917.07s -> 3918.37s]  So they did it talk.
[3919.17s -> 3920.37s]  We didn't see any writing.
[3920.97s -> 3921.97s]  No, no writing or anything.
[3921.97s -> 3923.57s]  I think I think we got spirit box.
[3923.57s -> 3924.67s]  Let's let's give it a shot.
[3925.37s -> 3926.37s]  Yeah, let's give it a try.
[3926.87s -> 3928.77s]  Says not discovered.
[3932.98s -> 3936.58s]  You put an EMF five fingerprints spirit box and it's not
[3936.58s -> 3937.38s]  giving me anything.
[3938.32s -> 3939.02s]  Ghost type.
[3941.08s -> 3942.08s]  What about Banshee?
[3943.66s -> 3945.56s]  Well, did we we don't have a cross so we weren't able to
[3945.56s -> 3946.26s]  test that.
[3946.36s -> 3951.84s]  Oh, yeah, Banshee needs to we need to have a crucifix, but
[3951.94s -> 3952.84s]  we need to buy one of those.
[3952.84s -> 3958.25s]  I think you're probably nothing there fingerprints.
[3958.55s -> 3959.45s]  What about a revenant?
[3960.80s -> 3961.40s]  Revenant.
[3961.90s -> 3962.60s]  What's a revenant?
[3963.40s -> 3964.00s]  Ghost type.
[3964.20s -> 3965.10s]  Let's look into it.
[3966.08s -> 3966.68s]  Let's have a look.
[3969.56s -> 3971.66s]  Remember you're an overconfident clueless guy.
[3972.82s -> 3980.54s]  And I make it to the end of the movie every time so it could
[3980.54s -> 3981.84s]  be a Banshee or a revenant.
[3985.08s -> 3985.88s]  How's Vinnie doing?
[3985.88s -> 3986.78s]  Is he just kind of hanging out?
[3986.78s -> 3988.48s]  I wonder like what is he doing?
[3988.48s -> 3989.88s]  He must be super bored in there.
[3989.98s -> 3990.38s]  Oh, it says.
[3990.38s -> 3990.58s]  Okay.
[3990.58s -> 3990.78s]  Yeah.
[3990.78s -> 3993.98s]  Revenant could be EMF level five fingerprints and ghost
[3993.98s -> 3995.28s]  writing, but we never got ghost writing.
[3995.28s -> 3996.48s]  Did we never got ghost writing?
[3996.48s -> 3999.08s]  You got to put ghost writing in the right room, the room
[3999.08s -> 4001.18s]  that has all the stuff we didn't we never did that.
[4001.98s -> 4005.18s]  So we can take a stab at it when you almost died and
[4005.18s -> 4008.28s]  you found the the black light in the hallway.
[4008.68s -> 4010.68s]  I had all the problems in the bathroom and then in one
[4010.68s -> 4013.78s]  of the bedrooms the bedroom has
[4015.48s -> 4017.28s]  had the fingerprints all over the door handle.
[4017.58s -> 4018.08s]  All right.
[4018.38s -> 4018.68s]  Okay.
[4018.68s -> 4020.48s]  So he probably haunts the bedroom.
[4020.98s -> 4023.88s]  We could go up there with the with the ghost book and
[4023.88s -> 4024.88s]  see if he does anything.
[4025.96s -> 4027.06s]  You got to lock in your answers.
[4027.06s -> 4028.86s]  Apparently are we out of time though?
[4028.86s -> 4029.96s]  Like can we even do this still?
[4030.46s -> 4032.06s]  Do we all have to lock in our answers?
[4032.06s -> 4033.46s]  No, we're alive so we can do it.
[4033.46s -> 4035.66s]  That time means like countdown until he's pissed off and
[4035.66s -> 4036.56s]  starts the in range.
[4037.36s -> 4038.66s]  That's the enrage timer.
[4038.76s -> 4039.16s]  That's different.
[4039.16s -> 4039.56s]  Yes.
[4039.56s -> 4041.36s]  So let's see.
[4042.92s -> 4043.42s]  Lying.
[4043.62s -> 4044.12s]  How am I?
[4044.12s -> 4045.02s]  Why am I lying?
[4045.12s -> 4045.82s]  I'm not lying.
[4045.82s -> 4048.82s]  There was the ghost goo all over the handle to the bedroom.
[4048.82s -> 4050.12s]  Oh guys, apparently guys.
[4050.12s -> 4052.72s]  Apparently we all have to individually lock down our
[4052.72s -> 4053.62s]  own answers.
[4054.02s -> 4055.62s]  So what was what was the first one?
[4055.72s -> 4056.72s]  Can I copy your homework?
[4056.72s -> 4059.12s]  Evidence found was EMF level five, right?
[4059.12s -> 4059.92s]  Level five.
[4059.92s -> 4063.02s]  Yeah, and the second one we found was fingerprints.
[4063.32s -> 4064.62s]  Did what we didn't have a third one.
[4064.92s -> 4065.42s]  Fingerprints.
[4068.12s -> 4069.62s]  Fingerprints number two.
[4070.22s -> 4070.82s]  Two.
[4071.02s -> 4072.72s]  Oh, but the spirit box did go off, right?
[4072.72s -> 4074.02s]  I put fingerprints twice.
[4076.37s -> 4079.17s]  But you said that you heard the spirit box radio go off,
[4079.17s -> 4079.57s]  right?
[4080.07s -> 4081.17s]  Yeah, it was going like.
[4083.47s -> 4084.97s]  Okay, that sounds good.
[4084.97s -> 4087.37s]  He was talking to us too, but I don't know if that's the
[4087.37s -> 4089.77s]  spirit box or if that's like an in-game thing that you
[4089.77s -> 4090.57s]  hear in your ears.
[4090.57s -> 4092.97s]  Because when I was with Vinny, he was like legit talking
[4092.97s -> 4093.47s]  to us.
[4093.87s -> 4097.77s]  So I would say we can say I think Vinny had the spirit
[4097.77s -> 4100.07s]  box, but I could not yet discovered.
[4100.07s -> 4102.87s]  So we but we don't don't don't we have to.
[4103.92s -> 4104.02s]  Yeah.
[4104.02s -> 4105.12s]  How are you alive?
[4106.54s -> 4107.84s]  Let's be that purple power, right?
[4111.49s -> 4115.64s]  What do you really have to test this?
[4115.64s -> 4116.04s]  What do you want?
[4116.04s -> 4116.44s]  Yes.
[4116.44s -> 4117.84s]  Do we want to guess?
[4118.98s -> 4119.88s]  Yeah, I think we should guess.
[4119.88s -> 4121.88s]  I think it's pretty close.
[4121.88s -> 4122.78s]  Let's do let's try that.
[4122.78s -> 4123.88s]  Yeah, that was our first game.
[4123.88s -> 4125.18s]  Yeah, let's just fucking guess.
[4125.58s -> 4126.48s]  We don't know what we're doing yet.
[4126.48s -> 4127.58s]  Let's get Vinny back in here.
[4127.58s -> 4131.08s]  I agree guessing revenant, but we haven't got ghost writing.
[4131.08s -> 4133.08s]  I'm sure if we brought the book up, we might get that
[4133.08s -> 4134.18s]  emf level 5 ghost orb.
[4134.18s -> 4135.58s]  No, we never ghost orb.
[4138.73s -> 4140.33s]  Got a bunch of crazy ghost shit on this camera.
[4140.33s -> 4142.23s]  Yeah, leave it for some old lady in the neighborhood to
[4142.23s -> 4143.03s]  fucking find it.
[4143.13s -> 4144.73s]  We never got freezing temperatures from it.
[4144.73s -> 4145.93s]  So it can't be a banshee.
[4147.63s -> 4148.93s]  Yeah, we wouldn't know how to test for that.
[4148.93s -> 4149.53s]  Anyway, let's go.
[4149.53s -> 4150.03s]  Revenant.
[4150.03s -> 4150.53s]  Emf level 5.
[4150.53s -> 4151.83s]  We're not the freezing temperatures.
[4152.03s -> 4153.43s]  Freezing temperatures is your breath.
[4153.93s -> 4154.93s]  I'm going revenant.
[4155.03s -> 4156.03s]  Yeah, I'm going revenant too.
[4156.23s -> 4156.63s]  Okay, wait.
[4156.63s -> 4158.43s]  So how do you lock in your answer?
[4158.53s -> 4159.33s]  We just close the door.

[4160.83s -> 4163.33s]  But it won't let me it won't let me do that.
[4163.73s -> 4165.63s]  Maybe if we all guess something else.
[4169.27s -> 4170.77s]  I'm clicking it and it won't.
[4171.67s -> 4172.37s]  It's fine.

[4189.64s -> 4191.14s]  No, I just wanted a eulogy.
[4191.94s -> 4195.44s]  Oh, well you rub a dub dub.

[4207.76s -> 4208.86s]  We got that completely wrong.
[4210.06s -> 4214.03s]  No, we got $20.
[4215.79s -> 4217.09s]  What can we buy with 20 bucks?
[4217.89s -> 4219.39s]  Candle no glow stick.
[4222.02s -> 4223.92s]  It says here sick for us all to share.
[4224.72s -> 4225.32s]  We can get it.
[4225.42s -> 4226.02s]  Yeah, what's this?
[4226.02s -> 4227.52s]  We get a smudge stick, right?
[4228.46s -> 4230.76s]  EMF reader is $45.
[4230.76s -> 4232.06s]  A flashlight is 30.
[4232.26s -> 4233.16s]  We get all guys.
[4233.16s -> 4234.86s]  We get by to look to lighters.
[4234.96s -> 4236.06s]  Yeah, let's get some lighters.
[4238.05s -> 4239.25s]  No, I can't find any lighters.
[4239.35s -> 4240.35s]  I'm hearing an echo.
[4240.45s -> 4241.55s]  Is that my computer?
[4244.04s -> 4246.24s]  Maybe am I still a fire alarm?
[4246.54s -> 4247.14s]  Yeah, buddy.
[4247.34s -> 4248.14s]  A little bit.
[4249.04s -> 4250.34s]  No, you're not not anymore.
[4251.41s -> 4251.81s]  There you are.
[4256.91s -> 4257.91s]  It's like proximity.
[4258.95s -> 4260.55s]  So, you know when you're getting near him, it's actually kind
[4260.55s -> 4261.25s]  of useful.
[4261.85s -> 4263.15s]  I got some smudge sticks.
[4266.66s -> 4267.66s]  What are we buying?
[4268.36s -> 4269.86s]  I bought two smudge sticks.
[4269.86s -> 4270.26s]  I don't know.
[4270.26s -> 4271.86s]  I think they're just my sticks are good.
[4272.36s -> 4275.16s]  Journal also has description of all ghost types.
[4275.16s -> 4275.86s]  I've been told.
[4276.56s -> 4277.86s]  Yeah, we were looking at that.
[4278.74s -> 4279.84s]  Somebody else the host of the Lobby.
[4279.84s -> 4280.94s]  No, I can't select job anymore.
[4280.94s -> 4284.14s]  Open VR chaperone setting is what's making the noise.
[4284.34s -> 4285.24s]  Open VR.
[4285.24s -> 4286.34s]  What's open VR?
[4287.04s -> 4290.24s]  Oh, it's because you're you're on the edge of your VR play
[4290.24s -> 4290.94s]  space.
[4292.82s -> 4296.22s]  Wait, you're sitting down on the couch away from the lighthouses
[4296.22s -> 4297.92s]  and the thing is warning you that you're going to walk into
[4297.92s -> 4298.52s]  the wall.
[4299.32s -> 4300.72s]  But but it's warning.
[4300.72s -> 4303.82s]  It's not warning me because I don't hear it.
[4305.57s -> 4307.07s]  So it's going through the wrong audio device.
[4307.07s -> 4309.77s]  Maybe you could go to this advanced settings and turn that
[4309.77s -> 4311.17s]  light that warning off.
[4311.27s -> 4313.57s]  I've don't even I didn't even know that was an option.
[4314.07s -> 4315.17s]  Okay, I'll turn that off.
[4315.27s -> 4316.07s]  That's so weird.
[4317.37s -> 4318.97s]  Like Vinny, you're gonna hit your head on the wall.
[4318.97s -> 4322.99s]  Vinny watch out, but it tells you that I'm gonna hit my head
[4322.99s -> 4323.39s]  on the wall.
[4323.39s -> 4323.89s]  Not me.
[4328.69s -> 4330.09s]  Chad, do you know how to turn that off?
[4331.42s -> 4333.72s]  Wait, if I stand up, do you still hear this fire alarm?
[4334.83s -> 4335.43s]  Yeah, dude.
[4337.09s -> 4337.39s]  Chad.
[4337.39s -> 4339.09s]  This was erroneous information.
[4339.39s -> 4341.99s]  Can you walk like in range that kind of way your lighthouses
[4341.99s -> 4344.79s]  are like can you like get in and you're like right in the
[4344.79s -> 4357.38s]  middle of it right here move further into your play space any
[4357.38s -> 4360.38s]  further chat and I'll be like fucking merging with my
[4360.38s -> 4361.78s]  computer guys.
[4361.78s -> 4364.28s]  Someone told me that zero sanity doesn't kill you.
[4364.28s -> 4367.48s]  It makes the ghost hunt you watch activity because when it
[4367.48s -> 4370.58s]  hits 10 ghosts want to kill that person.
[4371.08s -> 4373.48s]  Yeah, they start they start hunting.
[4375.58s -> 4375.98s]  Okay.
[4385.40s -> 4386.50s]  I kind of like the sound.
[4387.00s -> 4387.70s]  I'm not even kidding.
[4387.70s -> 4389.20s]  It's like it's fun to me.
[4390.30s -> 4390.70s]  Yeah.
[4391.30s -> 4392.20s]  No, it's not gone.
[4392.30s -> 4393.10s]  It's fine, dude.
[4393.10s -> 4393.60s]  It's fine.
[4393.60s -> 4394.00s]  It's fine.
[4394.00s -> 4395.40s]  It's it's it's a good bit.
[4395.40s -> 4396.80s]  Let's just let's just roll with it.
[4397.20s -> 4397.70s]  All right.
[4398.10s -> 4398.70s]  Sounds good.
[4400.79s -> 4401.29s]  We always know.
[4401.39s -> 4405.75s]  Did we decide on a did we buy something I bought?
[4406.49s -> 4407.99s]  Oh wait, did we share money?
[4411.26s -> 4412.46s]  I saw 20 bucks.
[4412.56s -> 4413.46s]  Okay, good kiwi.
[4413.46s -> 4414.66s]  I bought two smudge sticks.
[4414.66s -> 4416.06s]  Do you is that an echo?
[4416.16s -> 4419.06s]  Maybe you have my stream open.
[4420.19s -> 4425.09s]  No, wow weird like hear my voice coming from your mic.
[4425.99s -> 4427.69s]  You should turn me down then probably.
[4427.89s -> 4428.09s]  Yeah.
[4428.09s -> 4428.39s]  Okay.
[4428.39s -> 4430.69s]  I'm gonna do that when we get in or maybe I should turn you
[4430.69s -> 4431.19s]  down.
[4431.69s -> 4433.69s]  Yeah, I think I think you need to turn you're gonna have to
[4433.69s -> 4434.89s]  do that when we get into the game.
[4435.19s -> 4438.09s]  You can't adapt your weak chat echo of me.
[4441.37s -> 4445.47s]  We guys apparently we got guys people said we got $20 each.
[4445.47s -> 4446.47s]  It's not for the group.
[4447.27s -> 4448.27s]  I just had 10 bucks.
[4448.27s -> 4449.07s]  I bought a lighter.
[4449.27s -> 4451.17s]  We said turn off your shower on settings.
[4451.17s -> 4454.27s]  Oh, we should buy candles and smudge sticks then because
[4454.67s -> 4456.27s]  that can keep us from going insane.
[4457.37s -> 4458.07s]  Really?
[4458.47s -> 4460.97s]  Yeah, the candles if you light a candle in a smudge stick
[4460.97s -> 4463.27s]  in a haunted room, the ghost won't attack you in there
[4463.27s -> 4463.97s]  for a little bit.
[4464.67s -> 4469.47s]  If you burn sage and also if you put like powdered egg
[4469.47s -> 4472.17s]  shells on the back of your neck that also keeps spirits
[4472.17s -> 4473.87s]  away in real life.
[4474.37s -> 4475.17s]  Oh in real life.
[4475.67s -> 4476.07s]  Yeah.
[4477.87s -> 4481.47s]  Is somebody somebody the host again because I can't
[4481.47s -> 4482.47s]  select a job or anything.
[4484.27s -> 4488.37s]  It's oh, select job.
[4488.77s -> 4489.07s]  Yeah.
[4489.07s -> 4490.27s]  Yeah, you must be the leader.
[4491.96s -> 4493.66s]  Is somebody Vinny said somebody said turn off your
[4494.26s -> 4495.16s]  I think Ross.
[4495.76s -> 4498.36s]  Yeah, that I tried that that's that's capes.
[4498.96s -> 4500.46s]  Ross just accidentally left.
[4500.56s -> 4501.06s]  Oh, we do.
[4501.36s -> 4502.66s]  Well, the code is the same.
[4503.96s -> 4506.16s]  He pressed leave.
[4506.26s -> 4509.66s]  I think we can just rejoin.
[4509.96s -> 4510.86s]  Yeah, I think the code is the same.
[4510.86s -> 4515.40s]  So ready or I'll be fair though.
[4515.50s -> 4518.10s]  You probably I don't know if you should put leave right
[4518.10s -> 4520.10s]  next like eight pixels next to start.
[4521.84s -> 4523.34s]  That should probably be down here a little like in a
[4523.34s -> 4523.74s]  corner.
[4532.19s -> 4533.09s]  You're sitting too.
[4533.69s -> 4535.99s]  Yeah, I've you know, I'm taking a little break between
[4536.69s -> 4537.79s]  back and haunts.
[4538.19s -> 4540.39s]  Can you walk forward so I can see what I look like when
[4540.39s -> 4540.89s]  I walk?
[4541.29s -> 4543.49s]  This is what you look like when you walk usually with
[4543.49s -> 4543.69s]  your eye.
[4543.69s -> 4545.09s]  Well, actually your arms are like this.
[4545.39s -> 4548.89s]  No, I do that because it's the edge of my couch.
[4548.99s -> 4549.39s]  I can do that.
[4549.69s -> 4550.49s]  I'm just chilling.
[4550.59s -> 4551.29s]  I'm just chilling.
[4551.49s -> 4555.19s]  Wait, so are we not able to ready up or something?
[4555.79s -> 4556.69s]  Oh, no, we're good.
[4556.69s -> 4559.29s]  Yeah, I think I hit select job and it like kicked me
[4559.29s -> 4559.99s]  out of the lobby.
[4560.09s -> 4561.69s]  Oh, what really?
[4562.09s -> 4562.49s]  Yeah.
[4563.19s -> 4563.99s]  Oh, it's me.
[4563.99s -> 4564.79s]  I had to do it.
[4564.79s -> 4566.79s]  This game is made very well.
[4567.59s -> 4568.59s]  Where do we want to go?
[4568.89s -> 4569.49s]  I have a cool game.
[4569.49s -> 4573.49s]  Actually, maybe like a tropical ghost.
[4573.49s -> 4575.49s]  That is absolutely not an option.
[4575.69s -> 4577.79s]  Okay, it's one that looks like it's sort of in the
[4577.79s -> 4581.39s]  middle of the country one in sort of like the Northwest
[4581.39s -> 4584.46s]  and one around LA or Nevada or something.
[4584.76s -> 4585.66s]  Oh, I don't know.
[4586.56s -> 4591.48s]  Oh, guys.
[4591.48s -> 4593.58s]  Look, they keep our memories here from all the time.
[4593.68s -> 4594.58s]  That we failed.
[4596.39s -> 4597.19s]  Oh, there's the picture.
[4597.19s -> 4597.39s]  What?
[4597.39s -> 4597.79s]  Why?
[4597.79s -> 4598.79s]  Oh my God.
[4601.18s -> 4602.18s]  Look at the good.
[4602.28s -> 4604.08s]  How did you take a German of the camera?
[4604.92s -> 4608.42s]  Your eyeball is popping out of your skull.
[4609.12s -> 4610.82s]  It is my okay.
[4611.62s -> 4612.32s]  You don't see it.
[4612.92s -> 4614.72s]  I think that's the flashlight on his shoulder.
[4622.36s -> 4623.46s]  Chat, you're seeing this, right?
[4623.46s -> 4624.86s]  Oh guys, we got to ready up.
[4624.86s -> 4625.66s]  Oh, we're already up ready.
[4628.64s -> 4629.84s]  You got to take a screenshot of this.
[4629.84s -> 4630.84s]  I could show them later.
[4631.04s -> 4631.74s]  Yeah, let me see.
[4631.74s -> 4633.24s]  Eyes is bugging out of his head.
[4635.84s -> 4638.04s]  We have one person who is not ready.
[4639.44s -> 4640.04s]  Yes, Vinny.
[4640.04s -> 4641.14s]  I think I'm sorry.
[4641.74s -> 4642.14s]  I got it.
[4642.14s -> 4642.44s]  I got it.
[4642.44s -> 4642.84s]  We're good.
[4643.04s -> 4644.84s]  You look like you're walking around a house in a towel
[4644.84s -> 4648.94s]  that's about to fall off your waist with like a whole
[4648.94s -> 4650.24s]  group of people over your house.
[4651.67s -> 4652.27s]  Oh shit.
[4652.47s -> 4652.97s]  Don't look.
[4658.74s -> 4658.94s]  All right.
[4658.94s -> 4659.44s]  We start.
[4659.74s -> 4660.74s]  How do we start the job?
[4662.00s -> 4663.20s]  I think we're good, right?
[4663.50s -> 4663.90s]  We're good.
[4663.90s -> 4664.50s]  Everyone's ready.
[4664.60s -> 4666.80s]  So we just think you have you started.
[4666.80s -> 4668.70s]  You somebody has to be a serious first start button.
[4668.70s -> 4669.90s]  Let's fucking go.
[4670.70s -> 4672.30s]  I can't go ghost time.
[4672.70s -> 4674.40s]  I want to play the ghost game some more.
[4674.40s -> 4676.30s]  I'm so fucking amped up right now.
[4686.80s -> 4690.80s]  Chad, the chaperone settings definitely do not seem to be
[4690.80s -> 4691.10s]  a thing.
[4691.10s -> 4692.90s]  I'm just saying advanced settings show.
[4697.73s -> 4698.53s]  99% already.
[4698.53s -> 4699.13s]  I didn't do anything.
[4703.76s -> 4704.46s]  I've got a candle.
[4704.76s -> 4707.26s]  I think this is a sponge sponge.
[4707.86s -> 4708.86s]  Oh, is that a sponge?
[4708.86s -> 4709.66s]  I thought it was a candle.
[4710.06s -> 4711.16s]  No, this is a blunt.
[4711.96s -> 4713.06s]  Oh, dude.
[4713.96s -> 4716.16s]  It's like a blind me up baby bird poop.
[4716.16s -> 4717.66s]  It actually waited actually is.
[4719.44s -> 4721.14s]  Oh, we shouldn't be lighting this shit.
[4721.14s -> 4723.04s]  I think this is our very smudge things.
[4723.04s -> 4723.84s]  Fuck that.
[4723.84s -> 4724.84s]  That's the smudge sticks.
[4724.84s -> 4725.94s]  I paid $15.
[4726.44s -> 4726.84s]  Put it out.
[4726.84s -> 4727.34s]  Put it out.
[4727.74s -> 4728.04s]  Shit.
[4728.04s -> 4728.44s]  Fuck.
[4730.09s -> 4730.69s]  Oh, no.
[4730.69s -> 4732.79s]  It we use them fall.
[4732.79s -> 4734.09s]  What do we do with the sun finder?
[4734.09s -> 4737.29s]  Okay, Joseph Williams is the ghost looks like a pickle.
[4737.29s -> 4739.09s]  The ghost of Willie with a crucifix.
[4739.99s -> 4741.49s]  Oh, wait, do we have a crucifix?
[4741.69s -> 4743.09s]  So we just wasted that, huh?
[4745.00s -> 4745.80s]  Oh, it's sage.
[4745.80s -> 4746.90s]  I thought it was a blunt.
[4747.30s -> 4750.50s]  Yes, it's sage and we just use all our money to buy those and
[4750.50s -> 4751.50s]  the lighter to light them.
[4751.90s -> 4757.30s]  I like to think that Vinnie's house is actually full of smoke
[4757.30s -> 4758.20s]  and he's just like, I don't care.
[4760.60s -> 4763.20s]  I just want to see a drawing of Vinnie playing virtual reality,
[4763.90s -> 4765.60s]  but they're like, this is fine dog.
[4765.60s -> 4766.90s]  Just yeah, exactly.
[4766.90s -> 4767.70s]  Fire all around him.
[4767.80s -> 4770.90s]  It's not it's not a good place for VR.
[4770.90s -> 4771.70s]  I'll tell you that much.
[4771.70s -> 4773.60s]  It's not conducive, but I make do.
[4773.90s -> 4776.60s]  So now this is the view of my crotch.
[4776.80s -> 4779.00s]  So we'll be using this to find ghosts.
[4780.20s -> 4780.90s]  It's on your belt.
[4780.90s -> 4785.30s]  Can I do you have who has the not the blunt?
[4785.30s -> 4788.90s]  Who's got the thing that makes the thing light up and do the
[4788.90s -> 4790.80s]  thingies the flashlights?
[4791.10s -> 4791.60s]  I have this.
[4792.00s -> 4792.80s]  I have this.
[4795.20s -> 4796.50s]  The thing that I have got it.
[4796.60s -> 4800.00s]  I think that when you trade you this for this.
[4800.60s -> 4802.70s]  Yeah, see how strong you are.
[4802.70s -> 4805.50s]  Let's see if you're if you're a baby boy or if you are strong
[4805.50s -> 4808.88s]  Superman gonna grip it as hard as you can.
[4808.88s -> 4809.78s]  It's only two quarters.
[4810.48s -> 4812.98s]  I think you have to drop what is this sex?
[4815.30s -> 4815.80s]  What is this?
[4815.80s -> 4816.70s]  TOS.
[4816.80s -> 4818.10s]  Oh, you dropped it man.
[4818.10s -> 4819.10s]  Oh, there it is right there.
[4819.90s -> 4820.50s]  Here it is.
[4820.90s -> 4821.70s]  I'm going to throw it up.
[4821.70s -> 4822.60s]  You got to catch it.
[4825.20s -> 4825.70s]  Good job.
[4828.02s -> 4829.72s]  All right, I'll bring the spirit box.
[4831.13s -> 4833.73s]  Now with that you when you turn it on my sense of adventure,
[4833.73s -> 4835.13s]  I'll actually know I'm going to bring the book.
[4835.23s -> 4836.93s]  It got free recorded stuff.
[4837.23s -> 4839.23s]  I mean, I don't want to make sure you guys don't think of Joseph
[4839.23s -> 4839.83s]  Williams.
[4841.93s -> 4846.03s]  So that's the guy Joseph Williams because the pen is mightier
[4846.03s -> 4846.83s]  than the sword.
[4847.43s -> 4849.93s]  The pen is mightier and Jenna, I think I'm going to watch
[4849.93s -> 4850.93s]  I'm going to be security guy.
[4852.37s -> 4853.37s]  You're going to do that this time.
[4853.37s -> 4855.97s]  Yeah, you were the brave guy last time.
[4856.07s -> 4856.87s]  I think you earned it.
[4856.87s -> 4858.17s]  I've got to do the cabin.
[4858.27s -> 4859.37s]  This house is scary.
[4859.37s -> 4859.97s]  The cabin.
[4859.97s -> 4860.77s]  I think it's nice.
[4860.87s -> 4863.67s]  Did you want to turn down me on the volume by the way?
[4863.77s -> 4864.97s]  Oh, let's be real.
[4864.97s -> 4865.97s]  Let's be a list 30.
[4867.56s -> 4869.76s]  Dude, this reminds me of the thing we did with lolathon.
[4871.00s -> 4873.10s]  Yeah, it's sort of like that Mrs.
[4873.10s -> 4873.70s]  Mrs.
[4874.40s -> 4876.40s]  Whatever her name was Fletcher.
[4877.20s -> 4878.70s]  I was there for no filter.
[4878.70s -> 4880.00s]  No, no, this is a different thing.
[4880.00s -> 4880.60s]  We did.
[4880.90s -> 4886.15s]  It was like when we're doing like VR horror map with Aaron Mrs.
[4886.15s -> 4886.75s]  Fletcher.
[4886.85s -> 4887.85s]  That was right that Mrs.
[4887.85s -> 4888.45s]  Fletcher.
[4888.85s -> 4889.25s]  Oh, no.
[4889.25s -> 4891.25s]  Someone in the chat just said y'all are at the cabin.
[4891.25s -> 4892.65s]  Say you're probably bone.
[4893.55s -> 4895.25s]  Oh, everyone said that the cabin is hard.
[4895.25s -> 4895.75s]  Fuck.
[4901.82s -> 4903.22s]  Fucking game is so hard.
[4915.86s -> 4919.66s]  You guys have got four minutes and 40 seconds left until the
[4919.66s -> 4921.16s]  ghost gets angry at you.
[4954.95s -> 4956.05s]  I can love this movie.

[4978.54s -> 4979.94s]  What's that Roger?
[4982.39s -> 4983.59s]  No, no, there's something else.
[4983.59s -> 4983.99s]  There's something else.
[4983.99s -> 4987.03s]  It was John Williams.
[4988.98s -> 4990.48s]  What is that as a composer?
[4990.88s -> 4992.68s]  What was his name?
[4994.01s -> 4999.38s]  Did John Williams do the Little Rings soundtrack?
[5003.40s -> 5004.90s]  Joseph Williams.
[5006.29s -> 5014.54s]  Joseph Williams, are you here?

[5035.56s -> 5036.46s]  I can toggle it.
[5044.02s -> 5045.32s]  What is that over in the corner there?
[5045.32s -> 5046.52s]  That's something scary over there.

[5093.11s -> 5093.91s]  Not that I can tell.
[5107.04s -> 5108.74s]  Everybody sanity is doing okay, by the way.
[5108.74s -> 5110.14s]  We, by the way, had some activity.
[5110.98s -> 5111.88s]  We had some activity.
[5111.88s -> 5113.08s]  Somebody saw some activity.
[5113.38s -> 5115.22s]  What does that mean?
[5115.32s -> 5115.72s]  I don't know.
[5123.37s -> 5127.17s]  Hey, Ross, have you seen anything weird lately?

[5185.20s -> 5185.80s]  I see the bunny.
[5185.80s -> 5187.30s]  Are you doing a puppet show for me?
[5192.46s -> 5194.86s]  He's trying to like listen, like a conch shell.

[5232.12s -> 5233.22s]  Joseph Williams.
[5237.47s -> 5239.77s]  I should just go in there and fucking just stand in the corner.
[5246.65s -> 5248.15s]  You guys, your sanity is dropping.
[5248.15s -> 5249.65s]  You guys are at 74%.
[5252.25s -> 5252.65s]  Yeah, fuck it.
[5252.65s -> 5253.35s]  Listen, I'm going in.
[5261.06s -> 5261.96s]  I don't think they can hear me.
[5262.16s -> 5263.96s]  I was going to walk in slowly and be like,
[5264.56s -> 5266.26s]  guys, your sanity is at 75%.
[5299.64s -> 5301.64s]  Hey guys, your sanity is at like 75%.
[5301.64s -> 5302.54s]  Just want to make sure you guys know.
[5303.60s -> 5304.80s]  All right, do you have the black light?
[5307.05s -> 5308.95s]  Let's, I'll grab that for now.

[5319.39s -> 5320.49s]  I got it right here.
[5321.19s -> 5322.59s]  For any ghost babies.
[5322.59s -> 5323.59s]  Can you take it out of my hand?
[5324.70s -> 5326.30s]  I'm going to put it on my belt.
[5326.30s -> 5326.70s]  You know what?
[5326.70s -> 5327.40s]  I like that better.
[5327.40s -> 5328.40s]  I'm like, I don't think I can.
[5328.90s -> 5330.00s]  Okay, I'm going to put it out here.
[5330.10s -> 5331.10s]  So it's really easy to get.
[5333.30s -> 5334.00s]  Holy shit.
[5334.00s -> 5334.90s]  Yeah, you are right there.
[5337.65s -> 5337.85s]  All right.
[5337.85s -> 5338.55s]  It's on the ground right here.
[5341.03s -> 5341.33s]  All right.
[5343.09s -> 5345.89s]  So we lost our radio, but I guess we can still hear it.
[5347.00s -> 5347.80s]  We lost the radio.
[5348.40s -> 5352.18s]  I'm looking for the radio right now.
[5352.28s -> 5354.48s]  I got to stick with you guys because I have nothing.
[5356.60s -> 5358.80s]  You guys tried touching the like home alone trap.
[5360.38s -> 5361.98s]  Joseph Williams, give us a sign.
[5361.98s -> 5362.88s]  If you are here.
[5366.08s -> 5367.58s]  Uh, I heard that.
[5369.04s -> 5370.94s]  I heard, is that you?
[5371.24s -> 5372.24s]  No, no, that wasn't me.
[5374.34s -> 5375.14s]  Ross.
[5377.84s -> 5378.84s]  Thanks Ross.
[5379.64s -> 5381.54s]  Why are we doing this to each other at both games?
[5381.54s -> 5382.84s]  Well, why are we doing this?
[5383.84s -> 5385.24s]  We haven't won a single one.
[5390.94s -> 5391.64s]  What about in the attic?
[5396.31s -> 5398.31s]  Joseph Williams, are you here?
[5402.02s -> 5403.02s]  How old are you?
[5408.90s -> 5411.00s]  Joseph Williams, how old are you?
[5416.22s -> 5416.72s]  What the fuck was that?
[5423.70s -> 5425.50s]  Joseph Williams, are you here?
[5438.30s -> 5438.70s]  Radio.
[5440.08s -> 5442.68s]  Joseph Williams, put on the Red Sox game.
[5448.51s -> 5450.41s]  Don't touch that dial now.
[5450.41s -> 5452.21s]  We're just getting started.
[5460.66s -> 5461.06s]  Turn off.
[5477.93s -> 5479.63s]  Oh, I think I just turned off all the lights.
[5488.26s -> 5488.96s]  Oh shit.
[5490.47s -> 5491.87s]  Lights are flickering up in the attic.
[5494.52s -> 5495.72s]  Lights are flickering in the attic.
[5498.02s -> 5500.12s]  Somebody's in the attic.
[5500.12s -> 5501.92s]  In the attic, in the attic, in the attic, in the attic, in the attic.
[5504.26s -> 5504.86s]  Somebody's talking to me.
[5504.86s -> 5505.96s]  Somebody's whispering to me right now.
[5511.17s -> 5512.67s]  I'm in the attic, up in the attic guys.
[5512.67s -> 5513.27s]  I'm here alone.
[5513.27s -> 5513.87s]  I heard a whisper.
[5518.24s -> 5519.54s]  I have a fucking flashlight up here.
[5519.54s -> 5520.34s]  What did I do up here?
[5521.77s -> 5524.70s]  Somebody just whispered in my ear, up in the attic.
[5526.21s -> 5528.59s]  They went like, yo, I don't know.
[5528.59s -> 5529.39s]  There's something like that.
[5536.90s -> 5537.70s]  Okay, turn this back on.
[5545.93s -> 5547.13s]  Did the lights just turn back on?
[5554.24s -> 5555.54s]  Do you guys have a radio?
[5557.46s -> 5557.86s]  You guys have?
[5557.86s -> 5559.06s]  I can hear you.
[5559.36s -> 5560.66s]  Okay, I'm freaking out in the attic.
[5560.66s -> 5561.46s]  I can't, I can't see.
[5572.67s -> 5573.17s]  Wait a minute.
[5573.90s -> 5574.60s]  Wait a minute, Vinny.
[5575.78s -> 5578.28s]  Vinny, activate your fucking sonar powers and walk around.
[5579.43s -> 5580.13s]  We'll find each other.
[5583.75s -> 5584.85s]  No, just the beep, just the beep.
[5585.49s -> 5587.39s]  If you, if you just have, if you just walk around.
[5600.25s -> 5603.55s]  Vinny, if you, if you walk around the house and you just move slowly,
[5603.55s -> 5606.25s]  we can find each other because you're, you're the beeping.
[5611.45s -> 5612.15s]  I can hear you.
[5612.15s -> 5612.95s]  I'm not on radio.
[5612.95s -> 5613.55s]  I can hear you.
[5617.01s -> 5618.21s]  I'm, I'm in the attic.
[5621.33s -> 5622.53s]  No, I got glue.
[5636.60s -> 5637.80s]  I'm just trying to find the ground.
[5661.57s -> 5662.87s]  Yeah, we can't, nobody can see anything.
[5666.19s -> 5670.09s]  I'm trying to find the, I'm up in the attic and I'm trying to find the staircase to go back down.
[5675.55s -> 5675.85s]  Do you?
[5676.05s -> 5676.55s]  I can hear you.
[5677.79s -> 5679.49s]  Yeah, I lost you Vinny.
[5679.49s -> 5679.99s]  Where'd you go?
[5680.29s -> 5682.19s]  There's crazy noises happening right now.
[5682.39s -> 5682.69s]  Yeah.
[5682.79s -> 5683.49s]  Oh, I found the stairs.
[5684.76s -> 5687.36s]  Hey, yeah, you found the stairs and then the fucking stairs found us too.
[5687.36s -> 5687.86s]  Uh, hi.
[5688.16s -> 5689.06s]  Hey, there you are.
[5689.16s -> 5690.06s]  Oh, dude.
[5690.16s -> 5690.56s]  I see you.
[5690.56s -> 5690.96s]  I see you.
[5691.06s -> 5691.46s]  Yes.
[5691.46s -> 5691.96s]  Okay, good.
[5693.04s -> 5695.04s]  We have to figure out how to get the hell out of here.
[5698.57s -> 5698.87s]  Let's go.
[5698.87s -> 5699.97s]  Is this a flashlight?
[5699.97s -> 5700.57s]  What was that noise?
[5701.27s -> 5701.77s]  What noise?
[5702.17s -> 5704.57s]  Did you hear that a loud ring bell noise?
[5705.07s -> 5705.77s]  No.
[5706.47s -> 5706.97s]  I got a light.
[5708.08s -> 5709.98s]  Jerma, that's the best light we have right now.
[5712.88s -> 5714.78s]  That's the best we've got for navigation.
[5715.88s -> 5716.08s]  All right.
[5716.08s -> 5718.48s]  Well, that's going to help a ton because we can actually see some color.

[8176.79s -> 8185.59s]  can the other stuff kill kill kill me kill attack mammoth let's find out love
[8185.59s -> 8198.61s]  it oh big bird in sky rip the skull off head big egg try to I try to get egg
[8198.61s -> 8210.15s]  from nest lost lost head and scalp
[8210.15s -> 8214.38s]  spirit box fingerprints and ghost orb the only thing we didn't get was a ghost
[8214.38s -> 8217.82s]  orb but our camera is now fucking in a wall so there's no way that's gonna
[8217.82s -> 8221.54s]  happen we're never gonna find out if there was a ghost or that's that's it
[8221.90s -> 8231.64s]  what's what's the other shit out my face oh I believe we are poltergeist I'm
[8231.64s -> 8237.00s]  gonna yeah let me let me let me lock in poltergeist too before we we confirm
[8237.00s -> 8244.64s]  that I'm just reading up real quick before we also German we should you want
[8244.64s -> 8249.52s]  to get in there and take a couple more photos it or you uh you're good I think
[8249.52s -> 8256.36s]  I got zero left to take I'm going with poltergeist yep just because I saw that
[8256.36s -> 8264.11s]  thing fall off the wall I'm sure it's guys this is fun by the way once we got
[8264.11s -> 8269.47s]  it all figured out it took a while but yeah it was a good game I didn't I had
[8269.47s -> 8273.71s]  to change the control scheme though because I had tons of problems so yeah I
[8273.71s -> 8277.47s]  think it's a folder guys too having read all these this is great yeah it's
[8278.07s -> 8283.15s]  here's what here's what we have here chat guys it says here discover what type of
[8283.15s -> 8286.11s]  ghosts we're dealing with subjective one that we're working on okay we think we
[8286.11s -> 8289.87s]  got me capture a photo of the ghost we don't have and we still didn't get the
[8289.87s -> 8295.95s]  dirty water in the sink so it looks like we only got the EMF reader evidence
[8296.39s -> 8302.48s]  was it freezing in there think picture we didn't get good sink picture do we
[8302.48s -> 8310.88s]  need to take a picture of the EMF reader we got we got the EMF one okay that's
[8310.88s -> 8315.84s]  why it's gray took me photos accidentally camera ever again you guys
[8315.84s -> 8322.99s]  took some really nice photos though they look great memories after a photo of
[8322.99s -> 8326.59s]  what links probably the best we can do yeah the photo the ghost is probably
[8326.71s -> 8330.67s]  gonna be in the same room where the orbs are you just go in with the camera take
[8330.67s -> 8334.59s]  a picture with but we can't do much without the camera we can't see the orbs
[8334.59s -> 8346.06s]  yeah so we're we're done so we're boned yeah let's lock it in everyone entered
[8346.06s -> 8362.55s]  for ten bucks give me that ten dollars well the journal I did didn't it was a
[8362.55s -> 8375.83s]  race what the right what is a race race race what I wanted to know why it was a
[8375.83s -> 8383.80s]  race shit god damn it well how we had it I thought we had it too I really did
[8383.84s -> 8391.07s]  mega low that's my fault I was convinced it was poltergeist that's my fault I took
[8391.07s -> 8397.19s]  too many photos of things that it was the game's fault the camera went through
[8397.19s -> 8401.79s]  the wall hey that's true that's true the camera did go through the wall we had a
[8401.79s -> 8406.43s]  little bit of a glitch there it's fun to take the blame and put it on like
[8406.43s -> 8410.59s]  something else like the game yeah it's cool like I agree yeah I think I would

[9450.67s -> 9462.69s]  no no more no more let's talk about FTK for a second let me do that I can just
[9462.69s -> 9469.00s]  sit here so as you know on Saturday FTK is going to come back what that means
[9469.00s -> 9472.80s]  I'm looking right at you I see the chat the chat is going fucking crazy right
[9472.80s -> 9480.59s]  now I can see that's going so fast can't fucking talk no FTK is going back on
[9480.59s -> 9484.36s]  Saturday still trying to figure out exactly how we're gonna do some of these
[9484.36s -> 9488.12s]  systems because I know I told you guys that it was gonna be a white listing
[9488.12s -> 9492.96s]  system you just need to be an active sub and I think that's still gonna be the
[9492.96s -> 9496.84s]  case there's a really really simple UI that they these guys have made where
[9496.84s -> 9499.92s]  just in the game when you connect to the server you're just gonna check to see if
[9499.92s -> 9504.38s]  you're a sub just an active sub it just actually goes to twitch is like API and
[9504.38s -> 9509.68s]  goes oh you are okay you're good but because I've delayed it like an extra
[9509.68s -> 9513.71s]  three weeks I don't I don't know I'm trying to still figure out what I want
[9513.71s -> 9522.02s]  to do about it because I said that like a month ago oh you just just just be
[9522.02s -> 9524.98s]  subbed to the channel you just have to be subbed and then it didn't happen for
[9524.98s -> 9530.48s]  like a month but I feel bad that people may have subbed for that and then now
[9530.48s -> 9535.54s]  they didn't they're not subbed anymore and they're just like oh well thanks
[9535.54s -> 9539.10s]  dude like I was subbed to your channel for like a month or two and I thought
[9539.10s -> 9541.22s]  you I was supposed to do that so I'm trying to figure out what I want to do
[9541.22s -> 9547.56s]  obviously the last three or four weeks have been a little hectic a little a
[9547.56s -> 9552.54s]  little odd some stuff happened that I wasn't really necessarily like ready and
[9552.54s -> 9560.20s]  prepared to do but I'm gonna find out what we're gonna figure that out I get a
[9560.20s -> 9567.97s]  300 word essay I just subbed for that thing but it's gonna be a lot of fun
[9567.97s -> 9571.21s]  it's not what you think it is it's not just running around the server with an
[9571.21s -> 9575.49s]  arrow and a bow and shoot at the guy it's gonna be a very elaborate stream
[9575.49s -> 9579.65s]  there's gonna be way more servers this time it's not just gonna be one that
[9579.65s -> 9584.21s]  everybody just dumps on to there's gonna be a whole hub system where if you die
[9584.21s -> 9589.61s]  or if you initially join you go to this little hub server which is like a bunch
[9589.61s -> 9594.17s]  of servers connected to each other so you can hang out in there and just chill
[9594.17s -> 9600.17s]  out and you'll get pulled in in a first-come first-serve basis
[9600.17s -> 9611.34s]  they're gonna run advertisements like right now on FTK no I don't I don't
[9611.34s -> 9620.80s]  want to do that drop the IP what's gonna happen here is over the next few days if
[9620.84s -> 9624.40s]  you're not part of the discord I would really highly recommend you become part
[9624.40s -> 9629.58s]  of the discord because there's gonna be a lot of info put in there the actual IP
[9629.58s -> 9633.86s]  for the server the actual website it's not on yet and they're not gonna turn it
[9633.86s -> 9638.26s]  on till probably a day or two before so keep an eye on that discord I'm gonna be
[9638.26s -> 9641.02s]  in the general chat over the next couple days and you're gonna get everything you
[9641.02s -> 9645.58s]  need I'm perma banned from your discord well why did you act like such a bad bad
[9645.58s -> 9652.39s]  boy you got pro what do you got by got perma banned from the discord what did
[9652.39s -> 9663.48s]  you do it's cool gov stop don't be so bad watch your watch your mouth your
[9663.48s -> 9671.43s]  mother uses that computer too you know I'm abandoned from twitch too just to
[9671.43s -> 9681.00s]  just to complete the circle but that's probably gonna be tomorrow night into
[9681.00s -> 9683.44s]  Friday morning I'm not gonna be streaming the next two days because I
[9683.44s -> 9686.96s]  want to really get on this ball and make sure this goes smoothly Saturday's the
[9686.96s -> 9694.44s]  next time I'm gonna turn the stream on 3 p.m. Pacific on Saturday 3 p.m. that's
[9694.44s -> 9696.64s]  when it's happening that's when the streams gonna turn on that's what I'm
[9696.64s -> 9700.28s]  gonna start this specific events I'm gonna look at you here I don't need to
[9700.28s -> 9703.48s]  look at you down here you're right there I'm looking at you it's gonna be like
[9703.48s -> 9707.72s]  three or four specific events that this streams gonna entail so it'll be a lot
[9707.72s -> 9710.96s]  of fun I'm not gonna tell you what those events are because why would I do that
[9710.96s -> 9716.28s]  that's spoilers and I'm not gonna spoil anything for you so why would I do that
[9716.72s -> 9725.44s]  I feel uncomfortable when you look at the camera yeah I don't I'm looking at
[9725.44s -> 9733.06s]  the chat right here who'd have rested to it no I'm gonna I'm it's getting late
[9733.06s -> 9745.02s]  but minecraft 1.8 1.8.9 or 1.8.8 I'll get the exact details but it'll be much
[9745.02s -> 9750.09s]  more stable there'll be much more to do they were working on this for a long time
[9750.09s -> 9754.33s]  and it shows and the server is gonna stay up by the way after this I'm not
[9754.33s -> 9758.57s]  just gonna turn it off anybody that did not get to participate in the events of
[9758.57s -> 9762.97s]  the stream are going to be able to participate whenever they want for about
[9762.97s -> 9767.17s]  a month after the stream turns off so you guys can just join it you can play
[9767.17s -> 9772.94s]  it do all the activities whenever you want so for those who that didn't get a
[9772.94s -> 9776.28s]  chance to play it on stream and it's gonna be a lot of you because I think
[9776.28s -> 9779.58s]  there's only about three or four hundred people can be in the game server I
[9779.58s -> 9784.30s]  believe thousands of people can be connected to the hub server but in the
[9784.30s -> 9794.99s]  actual game server only a few hundred at a time I lost my sub feels bad man
[9794.99s -> 9799.85s]  yeah let me let me see what I want to do about that is that right I feel like I
[9799.85s -> 9805.93s]  feel shitty telling people to sub to do oh yeah sub through 50k oh sorry didn't
[9805.93s -> 9809.05s]  happen I'll see you next month you don't know you didn't want to sub again
[9809.05s -> 9820.49s]  tough shit I don't want to do that we'll see if there's a solution I'm looking
[9820.49s -> 9824.97s]  forward to it though so you'll see the stream turn on again for FTK but before
[9824.97s -> 9829.32s]  that join the discord I'll be in the general the mods will be talking about
[9829.32s -> 9833.26s]  it too we'll know we just got a bunch of community we got a lot of stuff but
[9833.26s -> 9837.86s]  there was a lot of subs and shit today but because of the nature of the game I
