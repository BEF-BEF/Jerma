[0.31s -> 14.50s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.50s -> 19.50s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demoman with the stuff that's on the screen right now.
[19.50s -> 24.50s]  I believe it's the strange lock and load, the charge and torch, and the islander, strange islander.
[24.50s -> 30.50s]  And of course, you got the hats and crap, the miscellaneous whatever, battery canteen, who cares?
[30.50s -> 37.11s]  So today I want to talk about something, not really to do about the gameplay, but to do with Team Fortress 2.
[37.11s -> 44.11s]  Specifically, how to get better at landing your pipes, or really anything in this game that has travel time.
[44.11s -> 50.11s]  This is not really gonna talk about hitscan, although this will probably help you out with your skits- skitscan.
[50.11s -> 53.11s]  What the hell was I gonna just say? With your hitscan as well.
[53.11s -> 59.11s]  But it's mainly gonna focus on the travel time things, like the Demoman pipes, all the rocket launchers,
[59.11s -> 62.11s]  and even the syringe gun, this could probably help you out with the syringe gun as well.
[62.11s -> 69.35s]  And what it is, it's TR Walkway. I didn't know anything about this map for the longest time.
[69.35s -> 74.35s]  And just very recently, like in the last two months or so, I've been going onto TR Walkway,
[74.35s -> 78.35s]  it's just a map you can play pretty much by yourself, and just been shooting bots.
[78.35s -> 83.66s]  And it might seem like the most mundane, boring thing in the world, but it actually is pretty addicting.
[83.66s -> 86.66s]  They just keep coming out, and you're on the red team, they're on the blue team,
[86.66s -> 91.66s]  and it's just they walk in a straight line, straight at you, and you can kind of make some adjustments,
[91.66s -> 96.66s]  you can make them do jumps, you can make them move in a different direction, and it's pretty fun.
[96.66s -> 102.66s]  You'll find yourself just sitting there for what seems like hours shooting at these bots.
[102.66s -> 106.66s]  And it's so important that you do this for a while, and you practice inside a TR Walkway,
[106.66s -> 114.66s]  because eventually your muscle memory will get down to a point where you know exactly where to put your crosshair in an actual game.
[114.66s -> 119.66s]  You'll go, oh, this guy's moving in the direction that I'm used to, I know where I'm supposed to place this,
[119.66s -> 123.66s]  because I know exactly how it's going to move, I know how the trajectory is going to go,
[123.66s -> 126.66s]  and it's going to hit the guy, and he's going to die, and I'm going to get more points,
[126.66s -> 128.66s]  and I'm going to do better in Team Fortress 2.
[128.66s -> 133.22s]  And I mentioned why it's so important to be in something like TR Walkway,
[133.22s -> 139.46s]  because everybody always says that to get better at the game, you got to play, you got to practice,
[139.46s -> 141.46s]  to get better, you just play, and you get better.
[141.46s -> 144.46s]  But it can be pretty damn hard sometimes, because when you get into a server,
[144.46s -> 146.46s]  and there's a bunch of people that are way better than you,
[146.46s -> 150.46s]  you're not going to get to practice your rocket launcher shots,
[150.46s -> 154.46s]  because they're going to just kill you in less than a second, and you're going to start to feel bad.
[154.46s -> 157.46s]  So what the bots don't attack back is the main thing.
[157.46s -> 161.46s]  They just move, and you can practice, and it's a way better environment,
[161.46s -> 165.46s]  and a way better place to get comfortable with the way that these weapons actually work.
[165.46s -> 171.02s]  And you don't have to feel so pressured by going up against these guys that have been playing forever,
[171.02s -> 175.02s]  that know everything about every class, that you can take your time with it,
[175.02s -> 179.02s]  and just sit sort of in a corner, and just get used to the way the item works.
[179.02s -> 186.02s]  I've seen such a huge increase, guys, in my amount of pipes landed, especially with Demoman.
[186.02s -> 192.02s]  Like, I mean, Soldier is one thing, but my pipes landed with Demoman has gone up significantly
[192.02s -> 197.02s]  just by hanging out in a Skype call with friends and just messing around in TR Walkway.
[197.02s -> 200.19s]  And then there are many more places besides TR Walkway, don't get me wrong,
[200.19s -> 205.19s]  TR Walkway is not, like, the only map in Team Fortress 2 where you can practice your shots,
[205.19s -> 209.19s]  but it's the one that I use, it's the one that I've fallen in love with, I guess.
[209.19s -> 213.37s]  And I will leave a link in the description to tf2maps.net,
[213.37s -> 216.37s]  where you can go download TR Walkway if you do not have it.
[216.37s -> 220.37s]  And please, in the comments section, if any of you guys have any other options
[220.37s -> 224.37s]  for people that are just as good as TR Walkway or even better,
[224.37s -> 227.37s]  some better options or other places you can go,
[227.37s -> 231.37s]  then please, by all means, leave some comments for some of the people that could use the help.
[231.37s -> 235.18s]  So that about wraps up that part of this video.
[235.18s -> 239.18s]  And the second part of this video, which is only about a minute or so long before this ends,
[239.18s -> 243.18s]  is I got this question asked in my livestream the other day,
[243.18s -> 246.18s]  and it was, when is my sister's due date?
[246.18s -> 249.18s]  Because somebody said that that was probably coming up pretty soon.
[249.18s -> 255.18s]  And yes, I'm going to be an uncle fairly soon here, in the next three or four weeks.
[255.18s -> 259.18s]  I believe my sister's due date is July 31st, and I'll be going down to North Carolina,
[259.18s -> 261.18s]  be taking all kinds of pictures with the baby.
[261.18s -> 264.18s]  I'm sure I'll tweet them out, so if you're not following me on Twitter
[264.18s -> 267.18s]  and you want to see these type of things, then that's probably where you're going to be able to see them.
[267.18s -> 269.18s]  But it'll be interesting. My parents are all freaking out.
[269.18s -> 273.18s]  Everybody's like going nuts right now, trying to figure out flight plans,
[273.18s -> 276.18s]  when we're going to meet down there, who is going, who is not going.
[276.18s -> 278.42s]  So it should be pretty interesting.
[278.42s -> 282.42s]  I'm sure I'll be in overdrive mode in the next three or four weeks.
[282.42s -> 285.73s]  But we will cross that bridge when we have to.
[285.73s -> 289.73s]  And also, before this video ends, I'm sure you're noticing right now,
[289.73s -> 292.73s]  we're losing by a pretty huge margin.
[292.73s -> 296.73s]  I'm not exactly sure why, because, I mean, we were doing pretty well.
[296.73s -> 298.73s]  I think people just weren't going on the point.
[298.73s -> 302.73s]  I'm watching it right now, and I seriously can't believe that with overtime,
[302.73s -> 306.73s]  we only have like, what, 15, 20 seconds capped right now.
[306.73s -> 308.73s]  And I mean, I was killing a lot of people.
[308.73s -> 310.73s]  I was doing pretty well in this gameplay.
[310.73s -> 312.73s]  And it was probably because I was just moving around too much.
[312.73s -> 316.73s]  I was going, I was dodging around the point rather than jumping on the point.
[316.73s -> 320.73s]  I didn't really have stickies either, which was pretty much a disadvantage
[320.73s -> 321.73s]  when you use this setup.
[321.73s -> 324.73s]  You can't really defend points as well as you could with stickies.
[324.73s -> 328.10s]  But regardless of that, that's going to wrap up this video, guys.
[328.10s -> 330.10s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[330.10s -> 332.10s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[332.10s -> 335.10s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
