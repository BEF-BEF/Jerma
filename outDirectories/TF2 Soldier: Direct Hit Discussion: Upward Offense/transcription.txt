[0.31s -> 18.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Soldier with the Direct Hit.
[18.50s -> 24.50s]  And before I get into any of the topics and any of the discussions of this video, I do want to talk about the Direct Hit a little bit.
[24.50s -> 31.50s]  I want to talk about how it's sort of rotted in my backpack and I neglected it for so long and how I'm so sorry.
[31.50s -> 36.00s]  Direct Hit will be friends. You'll be my best friend from now on.
[36.00s -> 41.00s]  So, getting a little bit weird in the first 15 seconds of this commentary already, but you know, let's just keep going.
[41.00s -> 49.30s]  So the Direct Hit, guys, is a phenomenal item. I think I've only talked about this maybe once or twice in the entirety of this channel.
[49.30s -> 58.30s]  But if you have aim, if you can really lead targets and you know how to land shots in this game, you can destroy people with the Direct Hit.
[58.30s -> 64.30s]  Especially buildings. It takes two rockets to take out a level 3 sentry gun that has not been repaired.
[64.30s -> 71.61s]  And because the rockets come out so damn fast, half of the engineers in the world are not gonna be able to react in time to repair their stuff.
[71.61s -> 76.61s]  So Direct Hit, I'd say, is number two in taking out sentry guns.
[76.61s -> 81.61s]  Now that might sound a little bit crazy, but Demoman Stickies, of course, we all know is number one.
[81.61s -> 86.61s]  And Heavies, I guess you could say would be number two, but I don't think so.
[87.61s -> 97.91s]  Heavies need to be really close to do any real significant damage to a sentry gun, whereas a soldier or a Demoman can be across the entire freaking map.
[97.91s -> 101.91s]  And it's actually ridiculous at some points when you use the Direct Hit to kill a sentry.
[101.91s -> 110.47s]  You sit 50,000 feet away and shoot two little damn rockets and the thing explodes. It's almost unfair.
[110.47s -> 116.47s]  Now one thing that can be said about using the Direct Hit, and I do understand the argument against using the Direct Hit against sentry guns,
[116.47s -> 123.47s]  is the no splash damage or no splash radius. Well, it has a splash radius, but not that big.
[123.47s -> 130.47s]  And as we all know, to take out a sentry gun as a soldier, regular default, whether you're using default, Liberty Launcher, Black Box, it doesn't matter.
[130.47s -> 138.47s]  You shoot the ground around where the sentry is, hopefully killing the engineer and blowing up the dispenser and the building surrounding it.
[138.47s -> 142.47s]  You can take everything out with a few rockets, but the Direct Hit doesn't have that.
[142.47s -> 146.47s]  You have to catch people off guard, because if you do not catch an engineer off guard,
[146.47s -> 151.47s]  he can sit there and just whack at the sentry while you're trying to take it out and you will never kill him.
[151.47s -> 157.95s]  But, and this is a very big but, bigger than the biggest but you've ever seen on a big fat lady or something.
[157.95s -> 163.32s]  What? Bigger? What? I lost my train of thought because I'm trying to be stupid.
[163.32s -> 169.32s]  But anyways, when you shoot a level three sentry with the Direct Hit, after the first rocket lands,
[169.32s -> 176.56s]  if you immediately shoot another one, it is going to take less than one second for that sentry to go down.
[176.56s -> 183.56s]  And in the world of Team Fortress 2, that is absolutely insane, because this game is so chaotic as it is.
[183.56s -> 188.56s]  As an engineer, it makes me feel bad, because the engineer is my main, as a lot of you guys know that.
[188.56s -> 190.56s]  That sucks. That's horrible.
[190.56s -> 195.56s]  Less than one second is not even enough time for me to turn around and look at my dispenser.
[195.56s -> 199.56s]  Like, oh, let me see. What's that over there? Dispenser. What? My sentry's dead.
[199.56s -> 208.56s]  That's how crazy that is. It's less than one sec. I believe it's seven tenths of a second after impact of the first rocket before the sentry goes down.
[208.56s -> 215.25s]  And guys, my burps last longer than seven tenths of a second. I mean, that is just a ridiculous number to think about.
[215.25s -> 221.25s]  But we are going to change gears here a little bit, guys. I want to bring up something that's not really related to this gameplay at all.
[221.25s -> 224.25s]  It's about a poll I want you guys to take.
[224.25s -> 227.25s]  In the description of this video, it's going to take you to a polling site.
[227.25s -> 235.25s]  And on me and my polls, right, I do this quite frequently, but still, I do want to gauge your guys' opinions on the direction of the channel.
[235.25s -> 241.25s]  Because there are a lot of games that are currently out that are coming out this November and December, this holiday season.
[241.25s -> 246.25s]  And I want to know what you guys want to see. There's a lot of stuff. Hitman Absolution.
[246.25s -> 252.25s]  There's already, like, the Warcraft expansion. There's Guild Wars 2. There's a lot of things that I would like to do.
[252.25s -> 258.25s]  But I just don't know what I want to do. It's kind of... I'm in that mode right now where I'm always going to have Team Fortress.
[258.25s -> 262.25s]  Team Fortress 2 will always be here because I love the game and I'm always going to make content for it.
[262.25s -> 273.42s]  But what else is there? I mean, besides GTA V, there's so many things coming out in the next four to six months that there is a lot of opportunity for new content.
[273.42s -> 276.42s]  And you know me. I love variety. I'm all about the variety, guys.
[276.42s -> 284.42s]  So in the description, if you could please, if at least, like, 60 to 70% of you guys click that poll and go and vote on this.
[284.42s -> 290.42s]  This would really mean a lot to me. And it would be great for you guys, too, because then you guys can sort of pick the content for the future of this channel.
[290.42s -> 293.92s]  Which I like to involve you guys as much as I can.
[293.92s -> 301.92s]  So thank you in advance for doing that, guys. And in the comments section of this video, leave me your top three most anticipated games of this holiday season.
[301.92s -> 304.92s]  Because there are a lot of them. And I'm curious to know.
[304.92s -> 308.92s]  So leave that in the comments section. And that is going to wrap up the video.
[308.92s -> 312.92s]  So I'll see you guys all soon. And of course, take care, everybody.
