[1.46s -> 3.70s]  Somebody said he fell in the toilet again.
[3.70s -> 9.10s]  I mean, just imagine how that would play out.
[9.10s -> 17.96s]  Like butt sinks in, arms and legs both sticking out, wiggling.
[17.96s -> 22.06s]  Everybody help, I'm stuck!
[22.06s -> 23.18s]  That's not possible.
[23.18s -> 29.02s]  Maybe you got a tiny little toilet.
[29.02s -> 34.44s]  Like reaching with my index finger to try to press a text.
[34.44s -> 36.50s]  A phone that's in my other hand.
[38.74s -> 40.66s]  Send plunger!
[40.66s -> 44.50s]  Or just go live like that and not even fucking care.
[54.50s -> 55.54s]  Why are you live?
[59.38s -> 60.26s]  Why not?
[65.43s -> 66.95s]  My birthday was great.
[66.95s -> 68.81s]  I had a very good time on my birthday.
[68.81s -> 69.53s]  I went out to dinner.
[71.32s -> 72.20s]  Had some snacks.
[74.46s -> 75.34s]  It was actually very good.
[75.34s -> 76.46s]  It was very nice.
[76.46s -> 80.71s]  I have one problem though.
[85.11s -> 85.67s]  I got this...
[88.38s -> 89.50s]  I don't even know where it came from.
[90.86s -> 93.50s]  I want some medical professionals in the chat here to tell me.
[94.38s -> 95.58s]  Hold on, let me tweet this out first.
[101.58s -> 102.38s]  My hand.
[103.10s -> 107.06s]  My hands have been immaculately clean and perfect.
[107.06s -> 108.18s]  Just baby soft.
[108.98s -> 110.02s]  Since I was a teenager.
[111.35s -> 113.19s]  I've never had a single problem with my hands.
[113.75s -> 114.87s]  They have been delicate.
[114.87s -> 115.99s]  They've been strong.
[115.99s -> 116.87s]  No calluses.
[116.87s -> 117.67s]  No warts.
[118.84s -> 121.24s]  And until yesterday.
[122.26s -> 122.74s]  What happened?
[124.36s -> 125.56s]  I think I have it.
[125.56s -> 126.36s]  I think I know what happened.
[126.36s -> 127.24s]  But let me just keep going.
[128.68s -> 130.84s]  I got a wart on my finger.
[133.03s -> 136.23s]  And it happened the day after my 35th birthday.
[138.39s -> 140.71s]  So I got one of those things and I was like,
[140.71s -> 141.67s]  what the fuck is going on?
[141.67s -> 142.39s]  This is bullshit.
[142.39s -> 143.91s]  Why do I have a wart on my finger?
[145.13s -> 147.29s]  I've never had a single growth.
[147.29s -> 147.53s]  Ever.
[147.53s -> 148.01s]  Like I said.
[148.01s -> 149.85s]  So I went and got one of those freezing kits.
[151.56s -> 153.16s]  I freaked out and I was like,
[153.16s -> 154.28s]  I have to freeze this thing off.
[156.73s -> 158.49s]  I got one of those liquid nitrogen little like...
[165.34s -> 167.74s]  You don't get an STD on your finger.
[168.62s -> 168.94s]  Okay?
[168.94s -> 169.90s]  That's not what...
[169.90s -> 170.70s]  It's not...
[170.70s -> 171.42s]  Look at how...
[171.42s -> 173.42s]  What's the definition of that word?
[177.38s -> 179.70s]  Your fingers are not a sexual organ.
[179.70s -> 183.91s]  I have an STD on my hand.
[187.74s -> 188.54s]  That's not even...
[188.54s -> 190.14s]  That's not what that means.
[194.81s -> 195.85s]  They are though.
[195.85s -> 197.13s]  What are you talking about?
[204.17s -> 204.65s]  They are.
[204.65s -> 205.37s]  Omega Low.
[206.63s -> 208.23s]  Tell the STD story.
[214.30s -> 214.54s]  No.
[214.54s -> 216.06s]  Well, I looked this all up.
[216.06s -> 216.78s]  Apparently like...
[217.42s -> 219.26s]  This is why I don't like to touch anything.
[220.47s -> 221.19s]  It's like a vi...
[221.19s -> 221.83s]  You can like...
[221.83s -> 222.31s]  I don't know.
[222.31s -> 223.99s]  Touch like a door handle that somebody touched.
[224.79s -> 225.35s]  Touch like a...
[226.33s -> 227.69s]  Touch like a surface.
[228.25s -> 231.14s]  This is why I don't touch anything.
[231.70s -> 234.34s]  The day after my 35th birthday.
[234.34s -> 234.58s]  Bang.
[234.58s -> 236.10s]  You have a wart on your hand.
[236.10s -> 237.62s]  Now I've freezed it off and now it hurts.
[238.65s -> 239.77s]  So my gamer finger...
[239.77s -> 241.05s]  It's in it, by the way.
[241.29s -> 243.53s]  Debilitating retirement incoming.
[243.53s -> 244.97s]  It's on my gamer finger.
[244.97s -> 246.49s]  It's right where it sits.
[246.49s -> 248.49s]  Like on the fucking mouse.
[251.00s -> 252.12s]  Like barely.
[252.92s -> 255.32s]  And I know everyone's going to say show it.
[255.32s -> 257.24s]  I don't want to show it because it's disgusting.
[257.24s -> 258.12s]  And I will never...
[258.12s -> 259.16s]  I will not show this.
[262.30s -> 263.26s]  So okay.
[263.26s -> 266.14s]  If I click very gently today, you know why that is.
[266.70s -> 268.06s]  I'm not going to show it.
[268.06s -> 268.94s]  No, I'm not going to.
[268.94s -> 270.38s]  It's revolting and I hate it.
[270.38s -> 272.22s]  I don't like showing gross things on my body.
[272.22s -> 272.78s]  No, I don't want to.
[273.50s -> 274.22s]  I'm not going to do it.
[274.78s -> 275.18s]  I can't.
[275.18s -> 275.74s]  I won't do it.
[277.58s -> 278.06s]  All right.
[278.06s -> 278.22s]  Okay.
[278.22s -> 279.74s]  What if I blur the camera?
[279.74s -> 280.14s]  Oh shit.
[280.14s -> 280.30s]  Okay.
[280.30s -> 281.26s]  What if I censor it?
[285.59s -> 287.03s]  Anyway, let's just go over what we're doing.
[289.46s -> 291.54s]  We're going to be playing The Long Drive today.
[291.54s -> 292.74s]  We're going to play Left 4 Dead today.
[292.74s -> 294.66s]  But I had a bunch of scheduling conflicts.
[295.54s -> 296.66s]  So we're not going to do that today.
[296.66s -> 298.10s]  We're going to do it maybe another time.
[298.10s -> 298.58s]  Who knows?
[298.58s -> 299.22s]  I don't know.
[299.22s -> 301.22s]  You know as good as I do right now.
[301.94s -> 306.62s]  Tomorrow I'm going to be on Kitboga's stream.
[307.26s -> 308.62s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[308.62s -> 309.42s]  I'll be elsewhere.
[310.14s -> 312.92s]  I'll make sure you know exactly where that is.
[313.08s -> 317.43s]  I have no idea when that is, by the way.
[317.43s -> 318.95s]  All I know is that it's going to happen.
[321.16s -> 322.92s]  Because the nature of what Kit does.
[323.80s -> 326.20s]  If he gets a good call, then maybe he'll want to bring me in.
[326.20s -> 327.72s]  If he's like, no, no, this one sucks.
[327.72s -> 328.44s]  No, no, no, no.
[328.44s -> 329.08s]  Forget this one.
[330.04s -> 331.48s]  But I will be on that stream.
[332.94s -> 335.66s]  Just kind of in the wings waiting to do something fun.
[335.66s -> 338.47s]  Am I going to use your voices?
[339.74s -> 340.46s]  I don't know.
[340.46s -> 341.90s]  It depends on whatever he wants to do.
[344.23s -> 346.47s]  That's the plan for the next, the remaining couple of days.
[347.40s -> 349.96s]  Now, if The Long Drive, if I'm done with The Long Drive in like an hour,
[349.96s -> 351.64s]  I'm just going to move on to that super game.
[352.57s -> 353.37s]  Like House Whipper.
[353.93s -> 355.62s]  All right.
[355.62s -> 356.82s]  Let me hold on.
[356.82s -> 357.22s]  Let me.
[358.10s -> 359.30s]  I have to put on pants.
[359.30s -> 362.26s]  And this is just I didn't think the cam was going to be on at all today.
[362.26s -> 362.90s]  I have to put on.
[362.90s -> 363.70s]  I have to put pants on.
[363.70s -> 423.86s]  I'll be right back.
[423.86s -> 424.18s]  It's good.
[424.18s -> 425.86s]  We're still on the starting screen.
[425.86s -> 427.14s]  That's fine.
[427.14s -> 437.24s]  Okay.
[437.24s -> 438.20s]  How do I censor this?
[438.20s -> 439.40s]  I don't want to show this shit.
[439.40s -> 440.28s]  It's disgusting.
[441.08s -> 445.03s]  Okay.
[445.03s -> 446.15s]  Webcams not even plugged in.
[448.46s -> 452.46s]  There is a monster that sneaked into this room at night and unplugged my webcam.
[452.46s -> 453.10s]  It's not me.
[454.55s -> 455.51s]  Why is it unplugged?
[458.04s -> 460.41s]  All the stupid things.
[462.57s -> 462.89s]  Why?
[463.53s -> 464.65s]  Why unplug my webcam?
[464.65s -> 466.33s]  Why not pull the power cord out?
[466.33s -> 467.29s]  That's way funnier.
[467.93s -> 468.25s]  I don't know.
[468.25s -> 469.37s]  I can't turn my computer on.
[469.37s -> 470.25s]  There's something wrong with it.
[470.81s -> 476.86s]  I'm going to fucking work.
[477.42s -> 481.85s]  Who is unplugging my webcam?
[486.50s -> 487.70s]  Did you guys hear like a doodledoo?
[488.50s -> 494.84s]  You did?
[496.34s -> 496.90s]  You should have.
[500.46s -> 501.18s]  Hey, there we go.
[501.18s -> 501.42s]  Okay.
[502.06s -> 503.70s]  All right.
[503.70s -> 505.59s]  So here's the deal.
[505.59s -> 506.47s]  I'm going to blur this.
[507.19s -> 509.45s]  My hair is a fucking mess.
[509.45s -> 509.85s]  Hold on.
[510.57s -> 514.89s]  It's delayed too.
[514.97s -> 518.81s]  I'll tell you that the trouble I'm going through right now to show you guys a wart on my finger
[518.81s -> 521.21s]  is it's insane that I'm doing this.
[521.77s -> 526.42s]  Okay.
[526.98s -> 530.18s]  So please not have like a weird frame here.
[530.18s -> 534.07s]  Okay.
[534.07s -> 535.11s]  I'm like so scared.
[535.11s -> 536.47s]  I like don't know if I should do this.
[537.27s -> 537.51s]  Okay.
[538.23s -> 542.84s]  You see?
[547.37s -> 547.85s]  Can you see?
[548.49s -> 548.73s]  Okay.
[548.73s -> 549.29s]  So here.
[549.29s -> 550.01s]  Clean.
[550.01s -> 551.21s]  Clean normal hands.
[552.62s -> 553.58s]  Regular.
[553.58s -> 553.82s]  See?
[554.62s -> 555.66s]  There's nothing weird there.
[555.66s -> 559.50s]  I cannot put my right hand up.
[559.50s -> 559.74s]  Okay.
[559.74s -> 561.34s]  Should I do it from far away?
[561.34s -> 568.44s]  No, I have to blur it.
[568.44s -> 570.04s]  This is not how big this was.
[570.04s -> 570.44s]  Okay.
[570.44s -> 573.08s]  It's after I froze this shit is when it did this.
[574.58s -> 577.70s]  So I like put the freezer on there for like 10 seconds or whatever.
[577.70s -> 581.19s]  And you take it off and your skin turns like all white.
[581.19s -> 584.54s]  And then it like it started inflating.
[584.54s -> 586.06s]  It actually started inflating.
[586.06s -> 587.02s]  I'm not kidding.
[587.02s -> 588.60s]  Okay.
[588.60s -> 590.60s]  If I show you from far away, that's that's like, oh, it's okay.
[590.60s -> 591.32s]  Right?
[591.32s -> 603.90s]  This is so embarrassing.
[603.90s -> 604.46s]  Do you see?
[605.18s -> 608.18s]  It hurts.
[610.18s -> 611.94s]  I'm not going to show it up close.
[614.28s -> 615.16s]  It's not alive.
[615.16s -> 615.40s]  All right.
[615.40s -> 617.56s]  I'll show it up close with us with a sensor tag on it.
[617.56s -> 617.96s]  Hold on.
[619.98s -> 620.94s]  It's literally nothing.
[620.94s -> 622.14s]  No, it is something.
[622.14s -> 624.62s]  You don't make me show it up close.
[624.62s -> 625.02s]  I will.
[627.03s -> 627.27s]  Okay.
[627.27s -> 627.59s]  Hold on.
[627.59s -> 629.99s]  I need to put a I need to put a blurring effect on this.
[629.99s -> 631.51s]  I need to focus the camera.
[631.51s -> 632.94s]  Okay.
[632.94s -> 633.34s]  Here we go.
[633.34s -> 636.34s]  Ready?
[636.34s -> 643.72s]  All right.
[643.72s -> 644.04s]  Okay.
[644.04s -> 645.72s]  So we're completely censored now.
[645.72s -> 646.68s]  So like doesn't matter.
[646.68s -> 648.68s]  Like you're not going to puke.
[648.68s -> 651.75s]  See?
[651.75s -> 652.79s]  I've been completely censored.
[652.79s -> 654.39s]  I could be in a fucking TV commercial.
[654.39s -> 657.19s]  I could be like a law show and you would have no idea who I was.
[670.70s -> 672.46s]  We need more censoring for this.
[672.46s -> 674.06s]  We need more censoring for this.
[675.91s -> 678.15s]  We need more censoring.
[678.71s -> 686.89s]  See?
[686.89s -> 690.23s]  I told you.
[690.23s -> 691.35s]  I told you it wasn't good.
[692.31s -> 696.44s]  And this shit's right on my gamer finger.
[697.08s -> 698.28s]  It's a homunculus.
[701.58s -> 702.38s]  No, it's not.
[702.38s -> 703.82s]  I it's that's from the freeze.
[703.82s -> 707.90s]  It was tiny but I freaked out because I'm 35 now and I can't have warts on my hands.
[707.90s -> 708.38s]  35.
[708.38s -> 710.62s]  I'm not 80, 105.
[710.62s -> 720.38s]  So it's on my gamer finger.
[720.38s -> 721.10s]  Long story short.
[723.34s -> 725.34s]  And you ain't ever going to see me again.
[727.48s -> 728.84s]  I'm turning the face cam off.
[728.84s -> 730.04s]  I don't want it on.
[730.04s -> 734.39s]  This ain't a face cam stream.
[734.39s -> 735.35s]  Imple popping.
[735.35s -> 736.07s]  Don't say that.
[736.07s -> 736.95s]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[736.95s -> 737.27s]  I hate it.
[737.27s -> 738.31s]  I don't even like looking at it.
[739.18s -> 740.54s]  I'm an incredibly clean person.
[741.64s -> 742.60s]  I'm so clean.
[742.60s -> 743.32s]  I shower.
[743.88s -> 744.76s]  I bathe.
[744.76s -> 747.24s]  I I do the I do I you know what I mean?
[747.24s -> 748.36s]  Like I bathe.
[748.92s -> 756.28s]  I go like this and like that doesn't bathe.
[756.28s -> 756.44s]  Yeah.
[756.44s -> 757.96s]  I go under the armpits too.
[757.96s -> 758.44s]  You don't.
[759.00s -> 759.56s]  You don't.
[761.70s -> 767.30s]  You just put the shampoo conditioner combo can thing that you buy at the grocery store
[767.30s -> 769.06s]  and you pour that on your head
[769.06s -> 772.74s]  and you shake that into a lather and then you let it run all over your body
[772.74s -> 774.58s]  while you smear your hands all over your body
[774.58s -> 778.20s]  and like all over your legs and balls and stuff.
[778.20s -> 779.00s]  That's what you do.
[779.00s -> 782.28s]  I know it is because that's what I did until I was about 30.
[782.28s -> 789.22s]  No, I use a puffy.
[789.22s -> 790.26s]  No, you don't.
[790.26s -> 792.18s]  You don't use a puffy until you're at least 28.
[792.18s -> 796.68s]  It was five years ago.
[796.68s -> 798.12s]  Five years is a long time, man.
[800.14s -> 800.94s]  That's a long time.
[803.94s -> 804.74s]  Every time I click.
[807.00s -> 811.61s]  Do I have to go on like the streamer like disabled list for 15 days?
[811.61s -> 814.20s]  Because I can't click the mouse.
[820.25s -> 825.05s]  All right, the Boston Red Sox have to put German 985 down to the disabled list.
[825.05s -> 827.13s]  You see, it's a big wart on his finger.
[828.49s -> 830.49s]  It isn't that embarrassing.
[830.49s -> 831.86s]  Back to you, John.
[836.33s -> 837.29s]  Please just drain it.
[837.29s -> 837.93s]  You're not supposed to.
[837.93s -> 838.33s]  No.
[838.33s -> 842.97s]  The wart specialist that I watched on YouTube said don't drain it when it becomes a boil.
[842.97s -> 851.43s]  They said after you do the freeze, it's going to do that and leave it alone.
[851.43s -> 852.15s]  Yeah, there's a...
[852.15s -> 856.31s]  Guys, are you that shocked that there's a wart specialist on YouTube?
[856.31s -> 862.39s]  You're like witches and warlocks on YouTube.
[862.39s -> 865.00s]  You don't think there's a wart guy?
[865.00s -> 869.00s]  All right, here we go.
[869.00s -> 870.68s]  This is the long...
[870.68s -> 871.72s]  I don't know what peaceful means.
[871.72s -> 873.24s]  I'm assuming there's like monsters or something.
[873.24s -> 873.88s]  I don't know.
[873.88s -> 877.74s]  I got $50 from Goiki.
[877.74s -> 879.90s]  Thanks for the 50, the 5,000 bits.
[879.90s -> 883.66s]  And they say, hey, Jeremy, the monkey ball timer ticking down sound haunted me while
[883.66s -> 885.90s]  I tried to sleep at the last stream.
[885.90s -> 886.70s]  Keep up the good work.
[888.06s -> 892.10s]  Get well from the gameritis growth on your gamer finger.
[892.10s -> 895.62s]  You know, you have a really great message because it says,
[895.62s -> 901.06s]  Hi, Jeremy, the monkey ball timer trickling down sound haunted me while I tried to sleep
[901.06s -> 901.54s]  last night.
[901.54s -> 904.10s]  Your stream was haunting me and I felt horrible.
[904.10s -> 905.14s]  Keep up the good work.
[905.14s -> 909.88s]  Thanks, though.
[909.88s -> 910.84s]  That's a lot of money.
[910.84s -> 913.86s]  Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[913.86s -> 914.58s]  Silence Serenity.
[914.58s -> 915.46s]  Thanks for five subs.
[915.46s -> 916.42s]  And Nuclear Waffle.
[916.42s -> 917.30s]  Thanks for five subs.
[917.30s -> 919.26s]  Thanks, guys.
[919.26s -> 919.98s]  Are we ready?
[919.98s -> 920.70s]  How do we...
[920.70s -> 926.42s]  I don't know how to play.
[926.42s -> 927.14s]  Wait, this is like...
[927.14s -> 928.74s]  I thought this was a driving game.
[929.30s -> 931.64s]  Hold on.
[931.64s -> 934.47s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[934.47s -> 935.43s]  E is open.
[937.03s -> 941.43s]  Why do I feel like I'm playing fucking TF2 at like 400 FOV?
[943.02s -> 944.46s]  Oh, you actually have to hold it.
[944.46s -> 945.64s]  Is there any sound?
[946.20s -> 949.88s]  Why is it so low?
[949.88s -> 953.29s]  Hold on.
[953.29s -> 953.61s]  Seed.
[953.61s -> 954.01s]  All right.
[954.01s -> 956.57s]  Okay, there's my fucking personal telephone number.
[956.57s -> 958.81s]  Hold on.
[958.81s -> 959.93s]  Let's put this up.
[959.93s -> 965.05s]  Is it better?
[965.05s -> 966.09s]  Okay, I can actually hear now.
[966.09s -> 966.41s]  All right.
[966.41s -> 967.37s]  What does this do?
[967.37s -> 968.17s]  Tab is equip.
[970.25s -> 971.61s]  Middle mouse button is rotate.
[973.32s -> 974.52s]  Oh, shit.
[974.52s -> 975.64s]  It's one of these games.
[976.89s -> 977.69s]  Move.
[977.69s -> 979.61s]  Okay, see, that's how you wash.
[979.61s -> 981.64s]  Okay.
[981.64s -> 983.22s]  Scroll is move.
[983.22s -> 984.98s]  You can move it towards you or forward.
[986.18s -> 989.42s]  Right mouse button is rotate.
[990.33s -> 992.01s]  Middle mouse and right mouse.
[992.01s -> 995.53s]  Well, this is going to be a fucking joy.
[996.09s -> 997.53s]  Wait, you guys can't see anything?
[997.53s -> 1002.98s]  Why did that happen?
[1002.98s -> 1005.30s]  Okay, so tab is equipped.
[1005.30s -> 1010.42s]  We got mouth wash, left mouse button, mouse wash.
[1011.54s -> 1012.26s]  Oh, cool.
[1012.82s -> 1015.85s]  This is so much fun.
[1016.65s -> 1017.13s]  Okay, cool.
[1017.13s -> 1018.25s]  Wait, cotton candy.
[1018.25s -> 1025.13s]  All right, so how do I pick this up?
[1025.13s -> 1026.33s]  How do I put this down?
[1026.33s -> 1030.31s]  Oh, F, pick that up.
[1030.31s -> 1033.14s]  And what the hell is this?
[1033.14s -> 1040.89s]  This is a duster.
[1040.89s -> 1042.25s]  Okay, I don't think that's what that is.
[1044.78s -> 1045.74s]  Eat this.
[1045.74s -> 1049.85s]  Can you?
[1049.85s -> 1055.99s]  I'm trying to do like party tricks.
[1055.99s -> 1061.99s]  All right, well, what am I supposed to do?
[1061.99s -> 1063.19s]  This is the cotton candy.
[1063.19s -> 1067.93s]  Do I need any of this stuff?
[1067.93s -> 1069.13s]  Wait, there's a gas tank.
[1069.13s -> 1072.46s]  This is going to take a while to get used to these controls.
[1072.46s -> 1073.66s]  Why is there a gun?
[1073.66s -> 1075.34s]  Is it a gun?
[1075.34s -> 1080.07s]  How do I use the gun?
[1088.74s -> 1089.62s]  I gotta clean the barrel.
[1090.18s -> 1090.90s]  A little rusty.
[1091.46s -> 1095.03s]  Oh, dude, I'm going to do the thing that happens
[1095.03s -> 1096.63s]  like John Wick when he goes,
[1096.63s -> 1098.26s]  get the hell out of my way.
[1098.90s -> 1102.78s]  You know what I'm trying to do.
[1102.78s -> 1106.09s]  Hey, seems like you're the one that's in my way.
[1111.98s -> 1116.18s]  How do I put items down?
[1116.18s -> 1119.77s]  Do I have to shoot with my other hand?
[1123.26s -> 1124.86s]  See, to me, this is like if you were like
[1124.86s -> 1126.06s]  a gun novice or something,
[1126.06s -> 1127.66s]  this thing on my right hand would be like
[1128.30s -> 1130.46s]  a product that somebody would sell.
[1130.46s -> 1132.46s]  That's just an absolute stupid bullshit product
[1132.46s -> 1135.22s]  that's supposed to help with suppressing the fire.
[1135.22s -> 1136.34s]  Here's the gun grip.
[1136.34s -> 1138.58s]  I feel like that would be on like an infomercial
[1138.58s -> 1139.70s]  that like four o'clock in the morning
[1139.70s -> 1142.58s]  that no one would buy.
[1142.58s -> 1145.32s]  You sick of the big recoil on your shotgun?
[1145.32s -> 1146.20s]  Not anymore.
[1146.20s -> 1149.26s]  All right, what the fuck do I do?
[1149.26s -> 1150.46s]  How do I put this down?
[1150.46s -> 1152.97s]  All right, I gotta look at the controls.
[1152.97s -> 1156.06s]  Mount, pick, mount, dismount.
[1156.14s -> 1158.78s]  Equip, reload, sleep.
[1169.58s -> 1170.30s]  Wait a minute.
[1175.06s -> 1176.42s]  Why is there a piss button?
[1184.31s -> 1186.79s]  Okay, this just turned into a completely different game.
[1186.79s -> 1188.15s]  This turned into a different game.
[1193.64s -> 1194.36s]  I don't know.
[1194.36s -> 1195.24s]  This is stupid.
[1195.24s -> 1197.70s]  Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
[1197.70s -> 1199.46s]  I still don't even know how to put things down.
[1199.46s -> 1201.11s]  All right, one, two.
[1201.67s -> 1202.87s]  Okay, so that's...
[1202.87s -> 1206.90s]  And I have a gun now.
[1206.90s -> 1207.94s]  How do I fire it?
[1207.94s -> 1215.58s]  What's this?
[1215.58s -> 1216.30s]  Okay, oh, there we go.
[1216.30s -> 1217.02s]  It's just in my inventory.
[1217.02s -> 1219.26s]  All right, give me the binoculars.
[1219.26s -> 1220.30s]  Good, okay.
[1220.30s -> 1221.70s]  Give me the fly swatter.
[1221.70s -> 1222.26s]  No, fuck that.
[1222.26s -> 1223.70s]  What's the pointless...
[1223.70s -> 1224.68s]  Ammo!
[1224.68s -> 1225.32s]  Nice.
[1225.32s -> 1228.63s]  Okay, pick up the ammo.
[1228.63s -> 1233.99s]  Okay, let's clean the car.
[1233.99s -> 1238.17s]  Is this doing anything?
[1238.17s -> 1239.05s]  Dismount.
[1239.05s -> 1244.55s]  How do I open the garage?
[1244.55s -> 1252.12s]  It's fantastic.
[1252.12s -> 1252.60s]  Okay, let's...
[1253.24s -> 1253.96s]  That's bright.
[1253.96s -> 1254.84s]  That's really bright.
[1254.84s -> 1255.56s]  What do I have to do?
[1256.52s -> 1258.52s]  This is a long drive, apparently.
[1265.80s -> 1266.52s]  I'm actually...
[1266.52s -> 1267.80s]  I wanna see what's in here.
[1267.80s -> 1269.96s]  Anything downstairs?
[1274.10s -> 1274.66s]  Ah!
[1274.66s -> 1282.38s]  I'm gonna put this in my dashboard thing.
[1282.94s -> 1286.23s]  You know, people have it on their rear view mirror.
[1286.63s -> 1287.43s]  Can I put this on there?
[1287.99s -> 1289.45s]  All right, hold on.
[1289.45s -> 1290.41s]  Open the door.
[1290.41s -> 1296.25s]  Okay, how do I get in?
[1299.51s -> 1299.75s]  Sit.
[1304.73s -> 1305.13s]  Nice!
[1305.85s -> 1307.77s]  Oh, I have to drive.
[1309.88s -> 1310.92s]  Okay, close this door.
[1311.96s -> 1313.80s]  And then we pull out?
[1313.80s -> 1314.84s]  Do I have gas?
[1314.84s -> 1323.45s]  How do I drive?
[1324.17s -> 1329.29s]  There's a crosshair.
[1329.29s -> 1335.66s]  Put this down.
[1336.38s -> 1337.64s]  Put the ammo somewhere.
[1337.64s -> 1339.40s]  All right, how do I turn the car on?
[1341.48s -> 1342.20s]  Oh, shit.
[1342.20s -> 1342.44s]  Okay.
[1343.16s -> 1347.37s]  How do you drive?
[1351.03s -> 1351.67s]  Oh, boy.
[1352.47s -> 1353.59s]  Okay, okay, all right, all right.
[1354.15s -> 1365.34s]  Okay, let's go.
[1365.34s -> 1366.22s]  And then we just drive.
[1366.94s -> 1368.25s]  Wait, we're driving too.
[1371.61s -> 1373.05s]  Dude, I can't even see!
[1373.05s -> 1374.33s]  I can't see the road!
[1377.67s -> 1378.47s]  Is there a road?
[1388.66s -> 1390.02s]  Oh, okay, but this is the road.
[1390.58s -> 1397.72s]  Okay, is it like this ultra bloom effect or what?
[1397.72s -> 1398.04s]  How far...
[1398.04s -> 1398.68s]  What do I have to go?
[1399.64s -> 1403.86s]  How do I turn up the super bloom?
[1413.88s -> 1414.44s]  You can't.
[1415.08s -> 1415.96s]  What do you mean I can't?
[1419.19s -> 1420.55s]  Wrong side of the road.
[1420.55s -> 1422.07s]  Ow, my gamer wart!
[1422.87s -> 1423.99s]  That hurts so bad.
[1424.97s -> 1425.29s]  See?
[1425.29s -> 1427.13s]  That's why I told you I couldn't fucking play.
[1435.37s -> 1436.89s]  That would have killed me, I think.
[1436.89s -> 1437.69s]  All right, slow down.
[1437.69s -> 1438.25s]  I gotta slow down.
[1438.89s -> 1444.01s]  Slice it off.
[1450.49s -> 1451.21s]  Wait, what am I doing?
[1451.21s -> 1452.65s]  No, don't open the door.
[1453.53s -> 1456.02s]  How do I use this?
[1456.74s -> 1460.86s]  Oh, it's cigarettes.
[1460.86s -> 1461.66s]  It's not ammo.
[1461.66s -> 1461.90s]  Okay.
[1462.70s -> 1465.74s]  How do you throw shit?
[1466.30s -> 1466.94s]  How do I drop?
[1481.16s -> 1481.40s]  Yeah.
[1481.96s -> 1483.72s]  Oh, okay.
[1483.72s -> 1486.44s]  All right, now I got two hands on the wheel.
[1486.44s -> 1487.32s]  So what's the goal here?
[1488.12s -> 1492.46s]  Do I have like a task?
[1493.18s -> 1496.10s]  It's just to drive.
[1496.10s -> 1497.70s]  All right, well, I'm gonna fucking kill this.
[1497.70s -> 1498.98s]  This game is gonna be done.
[1499.86s -> 1500.92s]  What's the end goal?
[1501.40s -> 1502.12s]  How far do you need to get?
[1503.00s -> 1509.56s]  Turn on the radio.
[1510.28s -> 1511.64s]  I don't think I have a radio.
[1511.64s -> 1513.98s]  It's long.
[1515.08s -> 1515.80s]  All right.
[1515.80s -> 1516.76s]  Well, I'm all right with that.
[1516.76s -> 1518.28s]  Actually, I prefer this.
[1518.28s -> 1518.84s]  Is that weird?
[1519.64s -> 1524.31s]  Watch out for that fucking rock.
[1524.95s -> 1530.78s]  What's that?
[1538.09s -> 1540.01s]  Did they just keep putting more obstacles?
[1543.18s -> 1543.90s]  You have gas.
[1544.62s -> 1548.66s]  I have like no gas in the tank.
[1549.30s -> 1551.96s]  What do you get gas?
[1552.68s -> 1559.86s]  I'm going 130, 140 miles per hour right now.
[1560.50s -> 1563.88s]  I need to go to a gas station, a gas store.
[1565.10s -> 1565.50s]  Really?
[1566.06s -> 1566.78s]  I have a GPS.
[1567.66s -> 1572.57s]  What's that?
[1572.57s -> 1573.45s]  I see something right there.
[1574.17s -> 1575.13s]  There's a house right there.
[1575.93s -> 1581.82s]  Hit the brakes, hit the brakes.
[1581.82s -> 1583.02s]  Brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes.
[1583.02s -> 1584.14s]  Brakes, hit the brakes, hit the brakes.
[1585.02s -> 1588.22s]  Holy shit, there's other cars here.
[1588.94s -> 1592.74s]  What happened?
[1595.45s -> 1595.69s]  What?
[1608.17s -> 1608.81s]  Did I drink it?
[1609.37s -> 1617.08s]  What did I just do?
[1618.10s -> 1620.02s]  How did I drink that without taking the cap off?
[1620.02s -> 1620.82s]  How do you throw things?
[1623.32s -> 1623.64s]  Nice.
[1624.76s -> 1627.70s]  Pick up.
[1627.70s -> 1628.34s]  What even is it?
[1638.79s -> 1640.15s]  This is gonna be fucking...
[1640.15s -> 1641.11s]  This is disgusting.
[1646.31s -> 1646.71s]  Come on.
[1647.96s -> 1649.80s]  It's been three days since I've had anything to drink.
[1654.89s -> 1656.01s]  Okay, that's probably against the rules.
[1656.01s -> 1656.97s]  I probably shouldn't do that.
[1657.61s -> 1659.03s]  Is that gas?
[1659.03s -> 1660.49s]  Ow.
[1661.54s -> 1662.02s]  Oh, shit.
[1662.02s -> 1662.58s]  Okay, here we go.
[1664.58s -> 1664.90s]  Push.
[1666.34s -> 1667.62s]  Ah, that's fun.
[1667.62s -> 1671.11s]  Okay, gas.
[1671.11s -> 1672.98s]  How much is in here?
[1677.64s -> 1679.48s]  I can drink the gasoline.
[1680.28s -> 1682.41s]  All right, how do I fill up a car?
[1682.41s -> 1683.05s]  Okay, here we go.
[1683.05s -> 1686.54s]  Open this and then gas.
[1691.32s -> 1691.64s]  Nice.
[1692.36s -> 1696.76s]  Is there an easier way to throw?
[1696.76s -> 1698.76s]  Okay, wait, can I suck the gas out of this one?
[1707.26s -> 1707.66s]  Hold on, I can...
[1710.71s -> 1722.33s]  Can you actually do that?
[1722.33s -> 1727.59s]  All right, how do I put this back on?
[1728.23s -> 1734.78s]  All right, this game just got way cooler.
[1734.78s -> 1735.42s]  Wrong side.
[1735.42s -> 1737.18s]  Okay, I gotta back this thing up.
[1747.91s -> 1748.79s]  I don't know why I do...
[1748.79s -> 1750.15s]  Okay, that song, was it...
[1753.77s -> 1755.21s]  I'm just telling you that's what I hear, okay?
[1758.44s -> 1764.09s]  How do I get the fuck out of the car?
[1764.81s -> 1766.17s]  I don't want to take the other door off.
[1766.17s -> 1766.57s]  Get out.
[1767.38s -> 1767.70s]  Out.
[1768.78s -> 1770.30s]  Lean is Q and mouse?
[1772.89s -> 1774.09s]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[1774.65s -> 1777.88s]  Okay, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[1778.74s -> 1779.30s]  I don't...
[1779.30s -> 1779.70s]  What?
[1779.70s -> 1781.06s]  I don't want to take the radio out.
[1781.99s -> 1783.19s]  E, okay, let's go.
[1783.19s -> 1785.82s]  What else is in here?
[1787.40s -> 1790.73s]  Extra tires, take them.
[1790.73s -> 1791.37s]  Oh, shit.
[1791.37s -> 1792.25s]  Can I put this in the trunk?
[1799.26s -> 1801.10s]  Okay, put the tire in the trunk.
[1801.10s -> 1802.38s]  You always need to spare.
[1802.38s -> 1805.46s]  What is this?
[1808.76s -> 1809.16s]  Can't see.
[1809.16s -> 1809.64s]  What does it say?
[1810.65s -> 1811.61s]  Car oil.
[1811.61s -> 1813.05s]  Extra virgin car oil.
[1813.05s -> 1813.93s]  All right, let's put it in there.
[1821.11s -> 1822.07s]  4% oil.
[1823.74s -> 1824.14s]  Diesel.
[1827.90s -> 1829.18s]  All right, 47% gas.
[1829.18s -> 1831.26s]  40% diesel, 30% oil, okay.
[1831.26s -> 1835.11s]  Can you open this?
[1835.11s -> 1835.59s]  Oh, wait.
[1836.79s -> 1841.40s]  Right.
[1841.40s -> 1841.90s]  I didn't...
[1841.90s -> 1843.34s]  Look, it's a video game, guys.
[1843.34s -> 1844.78s]  I didn't think I could actually open the hood.
[1845.34s -> 1847.62s]  It's getting dark out.
[1847.62s -> 1848.34s]  Put this back on.
[1848.34s -> 1849.30s]  All right, I gotta go.
[1849.30s -> 1851.22s]  I'm probably just gonna bring like creepers and shit.
[1851.86s -> 1856.18s]  Okay, this is scaring the shit out of me.
[1856.18s -> 1857.22s]  Wait, I gotta fill up the gas.
[1857.22s -> 1858.18s]  Fill up the gas, fill up the gas.
[1858.74s -> 1862.68s]  All right, fill this up.
[1862.68s -> 1866.06s]  Can I fill it up with this?
[1866.78s -> 1870.26s]  All right, hurry up.
[1870.26s -> 1871.46s]  I need to take one more thing.
[1871.46s -> 1872.50s]  I don't know what that is.
[1872.50s -> 1875.83s]  I don't know what this is.
[1875.83s -> 1876.60s]  I don't know.
[1876.60s -> 1877.88s]  I'm gonna take it with me though.
[1877.88s -> 1878.20s]  Ow!
[1879.56s -> 1880.52s]  Shit, that fucking hurt.
[1881.32s -> 1884.71s]  Let's go.
[1890.63s -> 1891.75s]  No, don't take that off.
[1891.75s -> 1892.47s]  Get in the car.
[1893.88s -> 1895.40s]  I can't see anything.
[1905.13s -> 1905.45s]  Okay.
[1916.70s -> 1917.90s]  How do I turn my headlights on?
[1918.46s -> 1922.81s]  How do you turn headlights on?
[1923.53s -> 1924.50s]  What does it say?
[1924.50s -> 1924.90s]  What's wrong?
[1925.54s -> 1928.68s]  You broke the car.
[1928.68s -> 1930.95s]  Turn on the headlights.
[1930.95s -> 1932.31s]  I don't know how to turn the headlights on.
[1933.83s -> 1938.81s]  Because you put oil in the gas tank.
[1939.61s -> 1946.57s]  I can't fucking see anything.
[1946.57s -> 1948.57s]  You put three types of fuel in here.
[1948.57s -> 1949.45s]  Fucking whatever.
[1949.45s -> 1950.41s]  All right, give me this one.
[1956.18s -> 1956.98s]  Get in here.
[1956.98s -> 1963.37s]  This one will...
[1963.37s -> 1964.81s]  This one probably at least has gas, right?
[1970.38s -> 1972.06s]  Shit, I just have to use my shitty car?
[1972.78s -> 1990.82s]  How do I turn on the headlights?
[1993.13s -> 1995.85s]  Handbrake, space, accelerate, brake, steer, ignition.
[1995.85s -> 1997.29s]  Eye, lean, lean up.
[1997.29s -> 1997.61s]  Lights!
[1998.41s -> 2006.76s]  You lost in the tutorial.
[2006.76s -> 2008.92s]  Well, I'm learning how to play in the tutorial.
[2008.92s -> 2009.72s]  I'll get it next time.
[2020.26s -> 2021.70s]  Go back for the motorcycle.
[2022.50s -> 2023.62s]  I didn't see a motorcycle.
[2024.34s -> 2045.98s]  Oh, blood.
[2048.65s -> 2049.85s]  That came out of my mouth.
[2054.15s -> 2055.67s]  Just spit out a bunch of kool-aid.
[2060.38s -> 2061.58s]  Can I get a different camera angle?
[2066.36s -> 2068.04s]  Oh, that might have been it.
[2068.04s -> 2069.99s]  That might have been it.
[2069.99s -> 2080.98s]  Longest drive, seven kilometers.
[2080.98s -> 2084.63s]  Doesn't seem very far at all, actually.
[2084.63s -> 2084.95s]  Okay.
[2086.04s -> 2086.76s]  All right, let's go.
[2086.76s -> 2087.24s]  Continue.
[2087.80s -> 2090.06s]  Wait a minute.
[2090.70s -> 2092.57s]  It gives you checkpoints?
[2092.57s -> 2095.80s]  This is not good, though.
[2096.36s -> 2097.24s]  I still don't have the gas.
[2097.96s -> 2101.27s]  This car has a bunch of fucking different fuel in it.
[2101.99s -> 2103.27s]  Can I do anything about this?
[2113.98s -> 2114.62s]  All right, what's this?
[2115.26s -> 2117.91s]  Can I bring this with me?
[2121.69s -> 2124.14s]  Oh, what's this thing?
[2125.18s -> 2127.78s]  This looks dangerous.
[2132.02s -> 2132.58s]  Oh, shit.
[2132.58s -> 2134.26s]  This is a way better car this time.
[2134.26s -> 2137.06s]  Give me the gun.
[2137.06s -> 2140.84s]  Give me the pew-pew balls.
[2141.56s -> 2149.45s]  Give me the oil if I need it.
[2151.85s -> 2153.91s]  Give me the coffee.
[2161.40s -> 2162.04s]  Whoa.
[2162.04s -> 2164.36s]  Oh, this is the front of the car.
[2164.36s -> 2165.16s]  No, it's not.
[2165.16s -> 2166.12s]  What kind of trunk is this?
[2171.37s -> 2172.09s]  What?
[2172.17s -> 2175.99s]  It's a front engine, a back engine.
[2181.51s -> 2183.59s]  What the fuck?
[2183.59s -> 2185.91s]  I've never seen a back engine.
[2185.91s -> 2187.11s]  This is freaking me out.
[2187.11s -> 2194.09s]  I've never seen this before in my life, in my entire life.
[2194.09s -> 2199.19s]  Oh, there's a block of gold.
[2199.19s -> 2200.81s]  This actually is a brick of gold.
[2200.81s -> 2201.37s]  All right, I need this.
[2202.01s -> 2203.99s]  Fucking god damn it.
[2203.99s -> 2205.03s]  It's over here.
[2205.03s -> 2211.82s]  Okay.
[2211.82s -> 2212.94s]  Holy shit, Jeremy.
[2212.94s -> 2213.58s]  Are you stupid?
[2213.58s -> 2219.96s]  There's like a bunch of gas here.
[2219.96s -> 2220.76s]  Pick it up.
[2220.76s -> 2235.82s]  Pick it up.
[2235.82s -> 2236.14s]  Good.
[2236.14s -> 2237.02s]  It fits.
[2237.02s -> 2239.30s]  I don't care.
[2239.30s -> 2240.10s]  What am I going to be?
[2240.10s -> 2242.25s]  Binoculars for what?
[2242.25s -> 2244.95s]  Oh, airbrush?
[2247.91s -> 2248.47s]  Oh, wait.
[2248.47s -> 2249.43s]  That's an emergency light.
[2249.43s -> 2249.83s]  I need that.
[2250.47s -> 2265.58s]  Go get the girlfriend downstairs.
[2265.58s -> 2266.86s]  What girlfriend is downstairs?
[2270.33s -> 2271.29s]  Whatever.
[2271.29s -> 2272.25s]  Wait, can I take...
[2272.25s -> 2272.81s]  What's in here?
[2273.37s -> 2274.33s]  Is it alcohol?
[2274.33s -> 2276.25s]  This is just all full alcohol.
[2278.18s -> 2278.74s]  I can just make...
[2278.74s -> 2279.22s]  Can I make...
[2279.22s -> 2280.26s]  Wait, this is diesel.
[2280.26s -> 2281.30s]  Okay, can I pick this up?
[2282.26s -> 2283.14s]  Okay, we're going to take this.
[2283.78s -> 2286.76s]  I'm going to put this in the back seat.
[2289.34s -> 2289.82s]  You never know.
[2289.82s -> 2292.22s]  I might find a truck and I could use it.
[2292.86s -> 2297.90s]  All right, this is like...
[2297.90s -> 2300.38s]  Okay, I bought a coffee table one time.
[2301.56s -> 2304.12s]  And I jacked up the entire inside of the back of my car
[2304.12s -> 2306.20s]  because I was like, no, I can get it in there.
[2306.20s -> 2307.64s]  And I technically could.
[2308.20s -> 2309.88s]  I could technically get it in there,
[2310.68s -> 2314.76s]  but not, like, safely to not ruin your entire backseat.
[2317.96s -> 2319.32s]  It technically fits in there,
[2319.32s -> 2320.68s]  but I ripped up a bunch of shit.
[2320.68s -> 2321.48s]  I ripped up the seats.
[2321.48s -> 2322.76s]  I scratched the fucking ceiling.
[2323.56s -> 2325.35s]  Let's see if I can get this in here.
[2325.99s -> 2326.55s]  Oh, yeah, I can.
[2326.55s -> 2327.03s]  Just remove it.
[2327.03s -> 2327.75s]  Just take the doors off.
[2328.39s -> 2329.70s]  What the fuck am I going to need these for?
[2329.70s -> 2330.10s]  Who cares?
[2331.30s -> 2337.66s]  Yep, just like the coffee table.
[2342.33s -> 2343.61s]  Wait, can I put this back on?
[2345.91s -> 2346.39s]  All right.
[2346.39s -> 2347.11s]  Yeah, we're good.
[2348.38s -> 2350.38s]  This is exactly what it looked like, by the way.
[2351.02s -> 2352.54s]  Except it wasn't as tall.
[2352.54s -> 2353.18s]  I can still see.
[2353.98s -> 2357.03s]  Okay, I need this emergency light.
[2359.14s -> 2360.10s]  Oh, that's how you throw.
[2360.74s -> 2361.77s]  That's how you throw.
[2361.77s -> 2362.41s]  What's under there?
[2363.13s -> 2365.05s]  That's pretty cool, but I don't...
[2365.05s -> 2374.09s]  Wait, wait a minute.
[2374.09s -> 2374.65s]  All right, I'm ready.
[2375.29s -> 2382.25s]  It's time to get huge.
[2383.50s -> 2384.38s]  I think I'm ready, right?
[2385.10s -> 2390.07s]  What the fuck was that sound?
[2390.07s -> 2390.63s]  Close the door!
[2391.51s -> 2392.63s]  I'm safe in the car, right?
[2395.02s -> 2395.66s]  What was that?
[2395.66s -> 2396.30s]  What was that?
[2398.41s -> 2401.51s]  Oh, what happened?
[2401.51s -> 2401.91s]  He died.
[2401.91s -> 2402.55s]  He's dead.
[2402.55s -> 2407.03s]  What happened to him?
[2407.03s -> 2407.83s]  What is this?
[2408.55s -> 2417.98s]  It's like a giant bunny.
[2419.53s -> 2420.17s]  Get out of there.
[2426.52s -> 2428.12s]  It ran into the wall and died.
[2430.63s -> 2431.43s]  Get out of there.
[2431.43s -> 2431.67s]  I know.
[2431.67s -> 2432.15s]  I'm just scared.
[2432.15s -> 2432.47s]  I'm just...
[2435.54s -> 2436.10s]  I believe.
[2436.74s -> 2438.26s]  I don't know why this just scared me so much.
[2438.26s -> 2439.38s]  Why did that scare me?
[2439.38s -> 2440.50s]  I thought another one was right there.
[2440.50s -> 2441.06s]  All right, I'm out.
[2441.78s -> 2444.15s]  Let's go.
[2451.02s -> 2453.37s]  I can't see anything.
[2453.37s -> 2454.49s]  Okay, I'm going to get this.
[2454.49s -> 2455.29s]  This is going to be fun.
[2455.85s -> 2460.31s]  Let's go.
[2467.29s -> 2467.93s]  This way, right?
[2473.10s -> 2473.66s]  I'm good.
[2473.66s -> 2475.74s]  All right, I'm looking for a big truck.
[2476.38s -> 2483.13s]  Turn on the radio.
[2483.77s -> 2487.38s]  I don't have any song files in that folder.
[2487.38s -> 2487.86s]  I saw that.
[2490.57s -> 2492.89s]  Music distracts the shit out of me when I'm driving.
[2492.89s -> 2494.33s]  That's why I never drive with music on.
[2503.00s -> 2506.81s]  You're not going to fuck with me.
[2506.81s -> 2508.89s]  No, I don't like driving with music.
[2508.89s -> 2509.69s]  It distracts me.
[2514.33s -> 2515.29s]  You're a psycho.
[2515.29s -> 2516.25s]  No, I just...
[2516.25s -> 2516.97s]  Look.
[2516.97s -> 2517.21s]  What?
[2518.41s -> 2520.57s]  So you want me to drive around with distractions?
[2521.37s -> 2523.48s]  I have to take a sip out of this drink,
[2523.48s -> 2525.16s]  but I'm afraid to because I think I'll drive into something.
[2525.16s -> 2525.72s]  Let's slow down.
[2532.55s -> 2534.07s]  No, I don't drive music.
[2534.07s -> 2542.12s]  All right, so I have a whole thing of gas.
[2542.92s -> 2545.00s]  We're looking for a truck.
[2549.05s -> 2550.49s]  Why did that just go down the wrong pipe?
[2551.77s -> 2552.17s]  Hold on.
[2562.58s -> 2563.46s]  Okay, sorry.
[2563.46s -> 2564.74s]  I just like swallowed that wrong.
[2565.62s -> 2570.34s]  And no distractions.
[2570.34s -> 2571.22s]  Stop distracting me.
[2571.94s -> 2574.23s]  No, I don't talk.
[2574.23s -> 2575.67s]  I don't want to talk to you in the car either.
[2576.47s -> 2577.91s]  This is how every car ride is.
[2589.58s -> 2590.22s]  No, it's not.
[2590.22s -> 2590.70s]  I'm not that...
[2591.42s -> 2592.06s]  All right, easy.
[2595.80s -> 2600.52s]  Look, I can talk and drive, but I cannot listen and drive.
[2601.40s -> 2605.66s]  So you want to get in my car?
[2605.66s -> 2607.58s]  I'm going to monologue the fuck at you.
[2608.22s -> 2609.42s]  But you can't talk to me.
[2610.30s -> 2613.77s]  All right, we got a pit stop here.
[2615.53s -> 2620.49s]  What do we got?
[2623.43s -> 2624.31s]  Oh, dear.
[2624.31s -> 2625.03s]  Okay, hold on.
[2625.67s -> 2627.67s]  What about my gas though?
[2628.23s -> 2636.22s]  I want to get out of the car.
[2636.78s -> 2639.14s]  I want to get out of the fucking car.
[2640.10s -> 2641.14s]  I want to get out of the car.
[2646.73s -> 2647.45s]  What is this?
[2647.45s -> 2649.77s]  This is like a Marty McFly bike.
[2650.41s -> 2659.27s]  I hear a fucking weird noise.
[2659.83s -> 2662.01s]  Oh, there's no tires on it.
[2662.57s -> 2666.70s]  All right, let's go.
[2666.70s -> 2670.71s]  Ah, what kind of tires does it need?
[2670.71s -> 2671.35s]  Does it have gas?
[2673.69s -> 2674.65s]  Turn your car off.
[2679.32s -> 2680.20s]  All right, turn it off.
[2681.08s -> 2682.55s]  Push and steer?
[2685.91s -> 2686.87s]  Why can't I push?
[2694.30s -> 2695.42s]  It's so stupid.
[2695.42s -> 2696.62s]  Okay, turn the car off though.
[2696.62s -> 2707.94s]  For real.
[2707.94s -> 2708.50s]  Turn it off.
[2712.78s -> 2713.90s]  I turned off the car.
[2714.94s -> 2715.50s]  Aye.
[2715.50s -> 2716.30s]  Okay, thank you.
[2716.94s -> 2725.37s]  What's that?
[2725.37s -> 2741.64s]  Okay, stay there.
[2741.64s -> 2743.48s]  I got to get tires for this.
[2748.04s -> 2748.52s]  What is it?
[2748.52s -> 2749.08s]  Radiation?
[2750.49s -> 2750.81s]  Gas.
[2751.37s -> 2760.97s]  What does this take?
[2762.01s -> 2763.53s]  Does it have a fucking gas tank?
[2764.17s -> 2766.22s]  Is this just a bicycle?
[2766.94s -> 2770.84s]  This is just a bicycle.
[2770.84s -> 2772.68s]  This is not a motorcycle.
[2780.02s -> 2782.41s]  Get out of the way.
[2782.41s -> 2782.97s]  Really?
[2782.97s -> 2786.68s]  Okay, tire.
[2786.68s -> 2787.43s]  Get this.
[2787.43s -> 2788.31s]  Pick this up.
[2788.31s -> 2809.51s]  Oh, okay, that does not work.
[2809.51s -> 2815.54s]  Does it need special bike tires or what?
[2817.50s -> 2819.83s]  Do we need a bike tire?
[2819.83s -> 2828.54s]  Where am I going to find a bike tire?
[2828.54s -> 2837.67s]  This shit should work.
[2838.15s -> 2843.98s]  Hey, all right, this one.
[2843.98s -> 2850.55s]  All right, sit it down.
[2850.55s -> 2852.15s]  Okay, pick this up.
[2852.15s -> 2883.72s]  It's dirty, that's why.
[2883.72s -> 2884.84s]  What the fuck?
[2884.84s -> 2887.59s]  What's wrong with this?
[2889.94s -> 2891.46s]  Because there's a hubcap on it?
[2891.46s -> 2898.12s]  Oh, shit.
[2898.12s -> 2899.32s]  Okay, I got a bike now.
[2899.32s -> 2900.84s]  I got a bike, I got a bike, I got a bike.
[2900.84s -> 2901.83s]  I got a bike.
[2901.83s -> 2902.55s]  Give me the bike.
[2902.55s -> 2907.18s]  All right, is there any space for me to pick the fucking thing up, please?
[2908.68s -> 2910.20s]  All right, what's a better car?
[2910.84s -> 2920.60s]  The green Cadillac or the red McQueen?
[2920.60s -> 2921.72s]  No tire?
[2921.72s -> 2922.60s]  What do you mean no tire?
[2922.60s -> 2930.55s]  It's right here.
[2930.55s -> 2932.47s]  Well, it would work if I could sit on here.
[2932.95s -> 2936.57s]  Whoa, I thought you said there was no gas.
[2936.57s -> 2937.77s]  You said there was no gas.
[2937.77s -> 2938.65s]  You said there was no gas.
[2938.65s -> 2941.51s]  You said it was a bike.
[2941.51s -> 2942.01s]  Why?
[2942.97s -> 2943.47s]  Liars.
[2944.65s -> 2945.53s]  Stand this up.
[2945.53s -> 2951.18s]  You said it was a bicycle.
[2951.18s -> 2956.78s]  All right, let's go.
[2956.78s -> 2969.22s]  Here we go.
[2969.22s -> 2970.18s]  This is a bicycle.
[2970.18s -> 2971.14s]  What's the gas for?
[2971.70s -> 2986.47s]  It's for turbo.
[2986.47s -> 2987.83s]  All right, I have to get on this now.
[2987.83s -> 2988.87s]  I have to leave now.
[2988.87s -> 2989.80s]  I have to get out.
[2989.80s -> 2990.36s]  I have to leave now.
[2990.36s -> 2991.00s]  I'm freaking out.
[2992.20s -> 2993.56s]  I got 100% gas.
[2993.56s -> 2996.06s]  Can I put anything on the back?
[2998.20s -> 2999.08s]  Stay upright.
[2999.08s -> 3000.28s]  How do I get it to stand up?
[3000.28s -> 3001.24s]  Where's the kickstand?
[3009.14s -> 3010.34s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[3011.78s -> 3014.82s]  Press B.
[3016.95s -> 3018.78s]  Balance.
[3018.78s -> 3020.14s]  Okay, I have to get on now.
[3020.14s -> 3021.58s]  Get on the bike.
[3021.58s -> 3021.98s]  Get on the bike.
[3021.98s -> 3022.38s]  Just get on.
[3022.38s -> 3023.02s]  Just get on.
[3023.02s -> 3023.98s]  Why is it doing this?
[3024.62s -> 3025.82s]  Why is it doing this?
[3025.82s -> 3059.34s]  Where are the lights?
[3061.62s -> 3062.42s]  Wrong way.
[3062.42s -> 3063.06s]  I'll get it.
[3063.06s -> 3063.56s]  Okay.
[3064.18s -> 3070.02s]  Okay, I'm going.
[3070.02s -> 3072.73s]  I have the gas.
[3073.29s -> 3076.91s]  Ignition.
[3080.78s -> 3081.50s]  It's a battery.
[3081.50s -> 3082.62s]  You need the battery.
[3082.62s -> 3083.12s]  What?
[3083.50s -> 3092.04s]  Don't run into a rock.
[3092.04s -> 3092.84s]  Don't run into a rock.
[3093.48s -> 3095.24s]  I'm going to use the headlights from the other car.
[3095.24s -> 3095.74s]  I find it.
[3104.47s -> 3106.86s]  Okay, that's not even a fart.
[3107.18s -> 3108.78s]  I can't get the funny fart joke thing,
[3108.78s -> 3110.70s]  but that is like you shit your pants.
[3111.50s -> 3115.21s]  Okay, I need the headlights.
[3115.93s -> 3121.80s]  They don't even...
[3121.80s -> 3125.72s]  Okay, I thought that was just like a supernova.
[3127.32s -> 3130.15s]  I need the headlights.
[3131.75s -> 3132.47s]  Thank God.
[3132.47s -> 3133.19s]  All right.
[3133.19s -> 3133.99s]  I need to be able to look.
[3134.71s -> 3139.10s]  Okay.
[3139.56s -> 3141.05s]  I have a little bit of light here.
[3141.69s -> 3145.75s]  I'm going to see if there's a battery by the gas pump.
[3152.71s -> 3153.21s]  Battery.
[3153.67s -> 3156.68s]  It's green.
[3156.68s -> 3161.06s]  No, this is oil.
[3161.78s -> 3168.41s]  Seriously?
[3168.41s -> 3168.91s]  Okay.
[3173.26s -> 3174.62s]  Just put this fucking thing.
[3174.62s -> 3175.66s]  Can I fit it in the car?
[3176.74s -> 3177.38s]  Can I fit the...
[3177.38s -> 3178.98s]  I want to take the bike with me though.
[3186.47s -> 3187.75s]  The engine's in the house.
[3188.39s -> 3190.15s]  Well, then I'm just going to have to sit and wait.
[3190.71s -> 3199.34s]  What's this?
[3199.34s -> 3205.90s]  All right.
[3205.90s -> 3207.50s]  I should probably shouldn't be breathing that in.
[3207.50s -> 3209.56s]  Well, it's a paint.
[3209.56s -> 3210.68s]  It's paint.
[3210.68s -> 3213.22s]  I get it.
[3213.22s -> 3214.26s]  It's paint.
[3214.26s -> 3214.66s]  Right.
[3214.66s -> 3215.16s]  Okay.
[3219.69s -> 3229.13s]  This isn't...
[3229.13s -> 3230.57s]  We're just not doing anything.
[3230.57s -> 3232.94s]  Somebody just gave a shitload of subs.
[3232.94s -> 3240.18s]  That's 59 community subs from Red Zed Rider.
[3240.82s -> 3242.74s]  Thanks for the nearly 60 fucking subs, dude.
[3242.74s -> 3245.61s]  That's insane.
[3245.61s -> 3248.79s]  Thank you, Red.
[3248.79s -> 3249.67s]  Holy shit.
[3249.67s -> 3252.31s]  We also had a bunch of donations too that came in that were huge.
[3252.31s -> 3260.58s]  What's that?
[3260.58s -> 3262.86s]  Is this it?
[3262.86s -> 3271.72s]  I just can't see anything.
[3271.72s -> 3273.08s]  Oh shit.
[3273.08s -> 3275.59s]  Like it doesn't turn the lights on in the house.
[3276.84s -> 3277.32s]  Oh man.
[3277.32s -> 3278.20s]  We're going to be fine now.
[3278.94s -> 3279.66s]  Oh god.
[3280.22s -> 3281.93s]  Is this it?
[3281.93s -> 3282.57s]  I think I found it.
[3283.21s -> 3285.34s]  This is definitely like a bike engine or something.
[3286.14s -> 3286.94s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3286.94s -> 3287.34s]  What is this?
[3287.34s -> 3287.90s]  A bike engine?
[3288.70s -> 3289.50s]  It's a bike engine.
[3306.17s -> 3307.05s]  Pick it up.
[3307.05s -> 3312.14s]  I'm going to lean this against the house.
[3315.26s -> 3316.46s]  Get in and close the door!
[3316.46s -> 3316.96s]  Get in!
[3328.58s -> 3328.90s]  Drive.
[3328.90s -> 3329.46s]  Drive backwards.
[3330.10s -> 3330.97s]  Drive.
[3338.70s -> 3339.42s]  Okay, I got him.
[3340.06s -> 3340.54s]  I got him.
[3340.54s -> 3340.94s]  I got him.
[3340.94s -> 3341.34s]  I got him.
[3341.98s -> 3344.94s]  Is it it?
[3345.58s -> 3353.94s]  Okay.
[3353.94s -> 3354.82s]  I don't hear any more noise.
[3355.38s -> 3358.07s]  Okay.
[3358.07s -> 3360.15s]  Is it weird if I just want to sit here until the sun comes up?
[3360.15s -> 3361.19s]  What if I just don't want to do anything?
[3363.91s -> 3364.87s]  I'm safe in my car.
[3365.43s -> 3368.52s]  It's like lightning, right?
[3368.52s -> 3372.76s]  When you're in your car, if lightning strikes your car, you're going to be fine.
[3373.78s -> 3374.98s]  You're protected in the car.
[3375.62s -> 3377.54s]  I don't know if that was a lie that my parents would tell me
[3377.54s -> 3379.06s]  because I was terrified when we were driving around.
[3379.06s -> 3379.94s]  There was thunderstorms.
[3379.94s -> 3380.98s]  Is that true?
[3380.98s -> 3388.70s]  It's the safest place of all.
[3388.70s -> 3394.87s]  Yeah.
[3394.87s -> 3395.43s]  Ow.
[3395.43s -> 3400.14s]  I'm a gamer wart.
[3400.14s -> 3400.54s]  Sleep.
[3401.62s -> 3402.50s]  Oh, I can sleep.
[3402.50s -> 3415.61s]  I think it's huge.
[3415.61s -> 3415.93s]  Nice.
[3418.30s -> 3420.46s]  Red, Zed gave another 50 subs.
[3420.46s -> 3422.46s]  Red, you are a fucking maniac.
[3422.46s -> 3424.62s]  That's like 110 community subs.
[3426.07s -> 3426.55s]  Thank you.
[3426.55s -> 3427.19s]  That's insane.
[3427.99s -> 3429.43s]  That is way too much money.
[3434.71s -> 3435.59s]  Oh, this is shit.
[3436.23s -> 3444.15s]  It's a ton of subs though.
[3444.15s -> 3444.71s]  Thank you, dude.
[3445.35s -> 3448.28s]  Okay.
[3448.28s -> 3449.40s]  So can I put this on?
[3453.77s -> 3454.09s]  Mount.
[3454.09s -> 3455.56s]  Ooh.
[3455.56s -> 3455.96s]  Bingo.
[3457.59s -> 3458.07s]  There we go.
[3458.63s -> 3459.58s]  It's been done.
[3460.22s -> 3465.56s]  Let's do it.
[3466.12s -> 3467.19s]  Hit the gas.
[3473.61s -> 3477.26s]  Oh.
[3477.26s -> 3477.90s]  There we go.
[3484.79s -> 3486.31s]  Oh, you didn't build the engine.
[3486.31s -> 3486.55s]  What?
[3487.35s -> 3489.93s]  Look at how fast I can go now.
[3492.68s -> 3493.64s]  Needs a battery.
[3495.50s -> 3495.82s]  Okay.
[3495.82s -> 3496.70s]  I have daylight.
[3496.70s -> 3497.58s]  Let's go.
[3497.58s -> 3502.55s]  Is there a battery in the house?
[3513.56s -> 3514.92s]  I'm going to prank my friend.
[3516.87s -> 3517.51s]  Oh, dude.
[3517.51s -> 3518.79s]  Did you see what happened in your front seat?
[3518.79s -> 3524.98s]  Somebody shit on it.
[3524.98s -> 3526.10s]  No, this is not real.
[3526.10s -> 3528.02s]  That's like the plastic poop stuff.
[3528.02s -> 3530.50s]  Like his friend didn't squat down and shit in his front seat.
[3537.26s -> 3537.74s]  Hey, dude.
[3537.74s -> 3539.42s]  Look, there's shit on it.
[3539.42s -> 3540.46s]  Did you just do that?
[3540.46s -> 3541.82s]  Yeah, I did.
[3546.60s -> 3547.24s]  Battery.
[3547.24s -> 3548.12s]  Give me a battery.
[3548.68s -> 3550.41s]  Let me see one.
[3550.97s -> 3552.92s]  Look, I want to take this bike there with me.
[3560.34s -> 3561.06s]  I see it.
[3561.06s -> 3561.94s]  No, you don't.
[3561.94s -> 3563.14s]  You do not see it.
[3564.02s -> 3569.62s]  Remember the headlight.
[3574.87s -> 3579.46s]  Okay.
[3579.46s -> 3580.50s]  Let me do what I was going to do before.
[3581.14s -> 3582.26s]  How much gas does this car have?
[3582.98s -> 3584.92s]  Where's the gas tank?
[3585.40s -> 3590.41s]  Where's the gas tank?
[3590.97s -> 3595.56s]  Is that in the trunk?
[3595.56s -> 3602.86s]  Is this an electric car?
[3603.58s -> 3608.18s]  Fuel tank empty.
[3608.18s -> 3610.02s]  Well, what the hell are you talking about, man?
[3610.02s -> 3611.38s]  That's the weirdest place.
[3612.18s -> 3612.95s]  All right.
[3612.95s -> 3613.35s]  Let's go.
[3615.61s -> 3616.09s]  Fill it up.
[3616.09s -> 3623.38s]  Fill up the tank.
[3630.14s -> 3632.87s]  Is this all the gas that was in here?
[3632.87s -> 3646.41s]  What is that?
[3646.41s -> 3648.62s]  Oh, right.
[3649.50s -> 3650.22s]  This is perfect.
[3658.01s -> 3666.89s]  3.9 ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined, water, water.
[3667.45s -> 3668.49s]  What are you talking about?
[3668.49s -> 3670.10s]  Derma, don't, don't.
[3670.10s -> 3672.90s]  Omega, well, please don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[3672.90s -> 3674.74s]  It's a gas.
[3681.98s -> 3682.62s]  No, it's not.
[3682.62s -> 3683.58s]  It's water.
[3683.58s -> 3684.54s]  Why does it have water in here?
[3685.18s -> 3693.56s]  I have a water meter on the right.
[3705.69s -> 3707.05s]  Peak hydration.
[3718.46s -> 3725.99s]  I'm just a running fountain.
[3725.99s -> 3728.07s]  Drinking and peeing at the same time.
[3728.07s -> 3731.18s]  All right.
[3731.18s -> 3731.66s]  That was cool.
[3734.10s -> 3738.09s]  Now what?
[3738.09s -> 3738.49s]  Oh, right.
[3738.49s -> 3738.81s]  Gas.
[3738.81s -> 3740.17s]  This thing's got gas now.
[3740.17s -> 3743.43s]  This thing's...
[3743.43s -> 3743.83s]  Oh, yeah.
[3743.83s -> 3743.99s]  Right.
[3743.99s -> 3744.79s]  This is missing a tire.
[3744.79s -> 3745.99s]  That car is way better anyways.
[3745.99s -> 3746.79s]  All right.
[3746.79s -> 3747.19s]  Let's take...
[3747.19s -> 3747.51s]  Wait.
[3747.51s -> 3748.87s]  Let me get the sponge so I can clean it.
[3750.76s -> 3752.74s]  Make, make, make, make.
[3752.74s -> 3753.06s]  Close this.
[3753.06s -> 3753.94s]  I want to clean this car.
[3759.56s -> 3760.52s]  I think this is...
[3760.52s -> 3760.68s]  Okay.
[3760.68s -> 3764.82s]  This is a good...
[3764.82s -> 3765.14s]  Okay.
[3765.14s -> 3765.62s]  Never mind.
[3766.66s -> 3767.46s]  It's not the sponge.
[3767.46s -> 3768.82s]  Why did I not take the sponge?
[3771.32s -> 3776.62s]  What a sick asshole would you be if you were doing that?
[3778.60s -> 3781.32s]  Just rubbing a gold bar all over your car.
[3781.96s -> 3783.18s]  What are you...
[3783.18s -> 3783.58s]  Oh, fuck it.
[3783.58s -> 3784.46s]  Are you a leprechaun?
[3788.57s -> 3790.10s]  I want to take that with me too.
[3790.90s -> 3791.78s]  Let's paint it red.
[3793.14s -> 3799.85s]  Oh, I hate it.
[3799.85s -> 3800.33s]  I don't like it.
[3800.33s -> 3800.65s]  I hate it.
[3800.65s -> 3801.45s]  I want another one.
[3801.45s -> 3803.94s]  Look on the roof.
[3803.94s -> 3804.66s]  What?
[3804.66s -> 3807.29s]  What color is this?
[3809.83s -> 3810.15s]  Blue.
[3810.15s -> 3810.39s]  Yep.
[3811.03s -> 3824.60s]  Tilt.
[3824.60s -> 3825.24s]  How do I tilt it?
[3830.87s -> 3831.91s]  This is going to look sick.
[3832.39s -> 3835.78s]  Stop grabbing it.
[3842.36s -> 3843.16s]  Let go of the...
[3843.16s -> 3844.36s]  Why am I magnetic?
[3844.84s -> 3855.48s]  Oh, it looks good.
[3855.48s -> 3857.45s]  Don't you think it looks good?
[3858.09s -> 3858.84s]  Chat.
[3858.84s -> 3859.48s]  I hate chat.
[3859.48s -> 3860.44s]  Don't you think it looks good?
[3860.44s -> 3861.08s]  Chat.
[3861.08s -> 3879.21s]  Look.
[3879.21s -> 3881.85s]  All I care about is taking the pictures from this side.
[3881.85s -> 3883.06s]  It's okay.
[3883.06s -> 3883.46s]  It don't work.
[3883.46s -> 3884.98s]  Guys, it's a Craigslist car.
[3884.98s -> 3892.31s]  I take the pictures from this angle, this angle, this angle, this angle, and this angle.
[3892.31s -> 3893.83s]  You don't see the whole other side of the car.
[3893.83s -> 3896.71s]  There's fucking dense scratches like smeared shit all over.
[3896.71s -> 3900.95s]  It doesn't matter.
[3900.95s -> 3902.07s]  Half the car could be missing.
[3902.63s -> 3904.18s]  All right.
[3904.18s -> 3904.98s]  This thing's ready to move.
[3904.98s -> 3909.05s]  There's no back seat.
[3911.19s -> 3912.23s]  No back seat.
[3913.59s -> 3913.99s]  Dudes.
[3915.67s -> 3916.95s]  How are we going to take our diesel?
[3925.99s -> 3927.43s]  To start the engine, climb the...
[3928.30s -> 3929.10s]  What are you doing?
[3929.10s -> 3931.10s]  Start the moped.
[3931.10s -> 3933.26s]  Climb on by looking at the seat and press the E key.
[3933.26s -> 3934.70s]  Press I to switch on the ignition.
[3934.70s -> 3936.94s]  Press space to lift the kick then hold W.
[3936.94s -> 3940.23s]  Climb on.
[3940.23s -> 3940.95s]  Press E.
[3942.71s -> 3944.23s]  Press I to switch on the ignition.
[3944.23s -> 3946.47s]  Press space to lift the kick then hold W.
[3946.47s -> 3948.31s]  That's what I'm doing.
[3948.31s -> 3956.44s]  Okay.
[3956.44s -> 3956.92s]  Press E.
[3957.48s -> 3957.88s]  Okay.
[3957.88s -> 3958.76s]  Press I.
[3958.76s -> 3960.54s]  Hold W.
[3960.54s -> 3961.18s]  See?
[3961.18s -> 3963.70s]  Doesn't matter.
[3963.70s -> 3965.26s]  Kickstand is up.
[3965.82s -> 3967.26s]  Doesn't matter.
[3967.26s -> 3976.07s]  And yeah, I need like a battery or something.
[3976.07s -> 3976.87s]  All right.
[3976.87s -> 3977.67s]  I got to take this with me though.
[3977.67s -> 3979.43s]  I won't eventually use this.
[3979.43s -> 3981.29s]  Let's pick this up.
[3981.29s -> 3982.81s]  Let's try to get this somehow in this car.
[3983.37s -> 3986.23s]  Take the battery out of the car.
[3986.23s -> 3987.88s]  The car battery.
[3987.88s -> 3989.32s]  Oh shit.
[3989.96s -> 3990.12s]  Wait.
[3990.12s -> 3991.48s]  I got to sleep in my car first.
[3991.48s -> 3992.89s]  Too late.
[3993.53s -> 4006.41s]  I can't sleep yet.
[4006.41s -> 4006.97s]  Why?
[4006.97s -> 4012.01s]  Get out of the car, are you buffoon?
[4012.01s -> 4013.21s]  What do you mean get out of the car?
[4013.21s -> 4014.89s]  This is the only place I feel safe.
[4014.89s -> 4027.16s]  All right.
[4027.16s -> 4030.12s]  That could have been me in the chair here like in real life.
[4030.12s -> 4049.29s]  Hey Jeremy.
[4049.29s -> 4049.61s]  Hey.
[4049.61s -> 4050.09s]  Hey.
[4050.09s -> 4050.57s]  Oh shit.
[4050.57s -> 4051.45s]  There's a person.
[4051.45s -> 4052.57s]  No, don't come in yet.
[4052.57s -> 4052.89s]  Hey.
[4053.29s -> 4054.09s]  What's up, man?
[4054.09s -> 4056.81s]  I'm just chilling here.
[4056.81s -> 4057.69s]  Don't come in the car though.
[4057.69s -> 4059.21s]  Just stand out there for like another five minutes.
[4059.21s -> 4059.77s]  You smoke, right?
[4059.77s -> 4060.57s]  Smoke a cigarette.
[4060.57s -> 4067.21s]  Come on.
[4067.21s -> 4069.46s]  Go to bed.
[4069.46s -> 4070.74s]  Adjust your mirrors.
[4070.74s -> 4072.95s]  What do I need to adjust the mirror for?
[4072.95s -> 4078.71s]  Until I get to look at me.
[4086.14s -> 4098.01s]  That's all I can do right now.
[4098.01s -> 4099.38s]  I can't sleep yet.
[4099.38s -> 4106.71s]  Are there other people?
[4106.71s -> 4113.05s]  I'm going to sleep with the lights on too.
[4113.05s -> 4117.88s]  The doors are locked, right?
[4117.88s -> 4119.56s]  Nobody can come in here.
[4119.56s -> 4133.08s]  How can I not sleep yet?
[4133.08s -> 4134.68s]  It's pitch black outside.
[4134.68s -> 4143.22s]  Please don't murder your battery.
[4143.22s -> 4149.08s]  Oh shit.
[4149.08s -> 4150.04s]  Oh shit.
[4150.04s -> 4176.04s]  Almost time to sleep.
[4176.04s -> 4179.64s]  I see it.
[4179.64s -> 4181.64s]  What do you see?
[4181.64s -> 4188.58s]  What do I even look like?
[4188.58s -> 4191.88s]  It's fucking coming.
[4191.88s -> 4192.52s]  It's coming.
[4193.16s -> 4194.04s]  I'm in my car.
[4194.04s -> 4194.52s]  I'm safe.
[4194.52s -> 4195.80s]  Nothing can hurt you in your car.
[4195.80s -> 4204.20s]  I got the lights on over here.
[4204.20s -> 4210.15s]  I'm fine.
[4210.15s -> 4210.79s]  Aliens.
[4210.79s -> 4220.87s]  What's that?
[4220.87s -> 4221.83s]  Is that what you're talking about?
[4221.83s -> 4222.55s]  What is that?
[4222.55s -> 4232.74s]  It's like a meteor.
[4232.74s -> 4243.14s]  All right.
[4243.14s -> 4257.13s]  Time to sleep.
[4257.13s -> 4257.69s]  Okay.
[4257.69s -> 4263.26s]  That's what I look like.
[4263.26s -> 4264.92s]  Wow.
[4264.92s -> 4265.88s]  That's cool.
[4265.88s -> 4268.06s]  You can actually see a head moving around.
[4268.06s -> 4268.22s]  All right.
[4268.22s -> 4268.78s]  What was I doing?
[4268.78s -> 4269.18s]  Battery.
[4269.18s -> 4269.66s]  Right.
[4269.66s -> 4283.50s]  Stupid back engine.
[4283.50s -> 4285.94s]  Wait a minute.
[4285.94s -> 4288.26s]  If I take the whole engine and put it in that car,
[4288.26s -> 4289.94s]  won't this have full gas?
[4289.94s -> 4299.06s]  Is that a battery?
[4299.06s -> 4302.73s]  What is this?
[4302.73s -> 4303.85s]  Coolant tank.
[4303.85s -> 4306.23s]  Where's the battery?
[4306.23s -> 4316.50s]  This guy doesn't have a battery?
[4316.50s -> 4319.64s]  Guys, I don't think batteries are in the game.
[4319.64s -> 4328.38s]  There's no such thing as a battery in the game.
[4329.02s -> 4329.98s]  Bike is already ready.
[4329.98s -> 4330.14s]  All right.
[4330.14s -> 4336.25s]  Let's just take it with us.
[4336.25s -> 4337.45s]  Can I take the seat out?
[4337.45s -> 4347.86s]  Did I do that?
[4347.86s -> 4348.34s]  Hold on.
[4348.34s -> 4351.32s]  Did I do that in my sleep?
[4360.78s -> 4361.10s]  Why?
[4363.80s -> 4364.44s]  Just drive.
[4368.01s -> 4368.41s]  Hold on.
[4368.41s -> 4369.29s]  I have to close that.
[4369.29s -> 4385.35s]  That's not going to work.
[4389.05s -> 4389.61s]  Or is it?
[4390.89s -> 4404.60s]  What's wrong with this?
[4405.48s -> 4416.46s]  I didn't put water in here.
[4416.46s -> 4419.99s]  What do you mean water?
[4419.99s -> 4422.60s]  I did not put water in there.
[4422.60s -> 4423.80s]  The thing is the tank is open.
[4423.80s -> 4424.20s]  Hold on.
[4425.00s -> 4426.06s]  Holy shit.
[4426.06s -> 4426.94s]  There's an animal.
[4426.94s -> 4443.96s]  I didn't close the gas tank.
[4443.96s -> 4445.66s]  Okay.
[4445.66s -> 4446.22s]  We're good.
[4446.22s -> 4480.82s]  Why?
[4480.82s -> 4482.68s]  I didn't fill it with water.
[4482.68s -> 4484.20s]  I drank the water.
[4484.20s -> 4484.44s]  Look.
[4487.16s -> 4488.36s]  100% gas.
[4488.36s -> 4489.70s]  Nothing else.
[4489.70s -> 4490.42s]  See?
[4490.42s -> 4495.66s]  What happened?
[4495.66s -> 4496.78s]  I need oil?
[4496.78s -> 4498.58s]  Oh, no.
[4498.58s -> 4499.30s]  What?
[4499.30s -> 4502.89s]  Check the oil.
[4502.89s -> 4503.13s]  Fuck.
[4514.54s -> 4514.78s]  All right.
[4514.78s -> 4515.82s]  Where's the oil?
[4515.82s -> 4525.40s]  That's the gas tank.
[4525.40s -> 4527.08s]  This car is freaking me out.
[4527.08s -> 4529.45s]  Where's the actual oil?
[4529.45s -> 4531.19s]  Isn't it underneath?
[4531.19s -> 4535.34s]  You need 3% oil.
[4535.98s -> 4541.34s]  3% oil in the tank.
[4541.34s -> 4551.05s]  Is it for real?
[4551.05s -> 4556.94s]  Like a lawn mower.
[4556.94s -> 4557.50s]  No.
[4557.50s -> 4558.22s]  That's gas.
[4558.22s -> 4559.58s]  I thought this is a gas tank.
[4560.14s -> 4568.62s]  3% oil?
[4568.62s -> 4569.66s]  Didn't do anything.
[4577.62s -> 4578.58s]  That's gas?
[4578.58s -> 4579.46s]  This is gas?
[4580.78s -> 4582.14s]  It says car oil.
[4586.87s -> 4587.83s]  Give me fucking oil.
[4587.83s -> 4588.87s]  Who's got oil?
[4588.87s -> 4596.58s]  Is this oil?
[4598.92s -> 4604.18s]  Oil?
[4604.18s -> 4607.05s]  Huh?
[4607.05s -> 4607.37s]  I can't.
[4608.33s -> 4610.78s]  Where's the indicator?
[4610.78s -> 4611.34s]  Oil.
[4611.34s -> 4612.06s]  Go.
[4612.06s -> 4616.09s]  All right.
[4616.09s -> 4617.05s]  3% oil.
[4617.61s -> 4626.23s]  What's going on?
[4626.23s -> 4628.49s]  I'm not even putting it in the car.
[4630.01s -> 4633.11s]  Is that OK?
[4633.67s -> 4652.66s]  Is that OK?
[4652.66s -> 4653.54s]  Just drive.
[4653.54s -> 4653.86s]  Hold on.
[4653.86s -> 4654.66s]  I need to close this.
[4656.15s -> 4657.48s]  All right.
[4657.48s -> 4657.88s]  We're good.
[4658.68s -> 4659.08s]  Let's go.
[4660.26s -> 4660.90s]  Long drive.
[4661.46s -> 4672.34s]  Nice.
[4672.34s -> 4672.58s]  All right.
[4672.58s -> 4673.62s]  I'm on the right track now.
[4687.56s -> 4688.12s]  Wrong way.
[4688.68s -> 4700.78s]  I care more about the mirror.
[4700.78s -> 4702.22s]  This was a face cam.
[4703.10s -> 4703.50s]  What do you mean?
[4703.50s -> 4704.46s]  Am I going the wrong way?
[4708.66s -> 4710.42s]  I don't remember what side this was on.
[4717.80s -> 4721.56s]  Guys, I don't know what the hell's going on.
[4722.20s -> 4723.51s]  This is the right way.
[4726.06s -> 4726.30s]  Hey.
[4727.10s -> 4727.98s]  Thanks, Jack.
[4727.98s -> 4728.46s]  Appreciate it.
[4739.59s -> 4741.11s]  Bike needed oil.
[4741.11s -> 4741.51s]  It's OK.
[4741.51s -> 4742.79s]  We'll get another one.
[4742.79s -> 4745.98s]  This car sucks.
[4745.98s -> 4756.17s]  Hey, guys.
[4756.73s -> 4759.05s]  Don't ever take your eyes off the road.
[4759.61s -> 4767.46s]  Hey, based 20.
[4767.46s -> 4768.42s]  Thanks for the five.
[4768.42s -> 4769.46s]  Just need to be able to use it up.
[4783.32s -> 4784.52s]  Your face cam in the mirror.
[4784.52s -> 4784.76s]  No.
[4785.32s -> 4786.04s]  No.
[4786.04s -> 4786.28s]  No.
[4786.84s -> 4787.08s]  No.
[4789.06s -> 4789.38s]  No.
[4789.94s -> 4792.97s]  What's that mean?
[4793.77s -> 4795.21s]  Is the car too hot?
[4796.01s -> 4801.16s]  Why do I have a minigun cooldown meter?
[4801.16s -> 4801.80s]  I don't understand.
[4801.80s -> 4803.16s]  What's that for?
[4803.16s -> 4808.63s]  I'm going on over here.
[4809.19s -> 4817.24s]  It means everything is fine.
[4817.40s -> 4817.96s]  OK, cool.
[4818.84s -> 4821.21s]  This is loud as hell.
[4821.21s -> 4821.93s]  Turn this shit down.
[4823.35s -> 4823.91s]  All right, we're good.
[4824.55s -> 4827.66s]  Do I need water?
[4828.22s -> 4831.67s]  How far have I even gone?
[4831.67s -> 4832.63s]  Is there a way?
[4832.63s -> 4834.23s]  The alignment of this car is so wrong.
[4834.23s -> 4835.35s]  It's just pulling to the right.
[4836.07s -> 4842.95s]  I'm just being ripped to the right side.
[4848.81s -> 4850.09s]  Spit in the engine.
[4850.81s -> 4859.26s]  Hey, German on 85 here.
[4859.90s -> 4876.47s]  I'm still alive.
[4876.47s -> 4878.07s]  I'm still alive.
[4878.07s -> 4878.39s]  OK.
[4881.24s -> 4883.32s]  OK, let's just get this shit out of me.
[4885.32s -> 4886.68s]  Can the car still drive?
[4890.38s -> 4891.66s]  It's all right.
[4891.66s -> 4892.38s]  I'll be OK.
[4893.38s -> 4894.58s]  Oh, boy.
[4894.58s -> 4895.22s]  Was somebody...
[4896.74s -> 4897.06s]  Yuck.
[4898.66s -> 4899.86s]  OK, we're OK.
[4899.86s -> 4905.86s]  Put this back on.
[4905.86s -> 4907.94s]  Wait, put it in neutral and roll it back.
[4907.94s -> 4909.22s]  I lost a mirror, but who cares?
[4912.36s -> 4913.40s]  Let's move it back.
[4914.81s -> 4916.65s]  Did the engine just fall out of the car?
[4918.62s -> 4920.70s]  Oh, shit.
[4920.70s -> 4921.98s]  It's all messed up now.
[4922.54s -> 4926.01s]  I don't need this.
[4926.01s -> 4926.33s]  OK.
[4929.46s -> 4930.42s]  Stop moving.
[4930.42s -> 4930.98s]  Stop.
[4930.98s -> 4931.22s]  No.
[4931.22s -> 4933.94s]  No, I don't want to kick it.
[4939.03s -> 4940.39s]  It's going to hit the other pole.
[4942.02s -> 4942.98s]  No, no.
[4942.98s -> 4943.62s]  Don't be...
[4943.62s -> 4944.10s]  Thank you.
[4945.64s -> 4946.20s]  Wait a minute.
[4947.02s -> 4947.58s]  Keep going.
[4947.58s -> 4947.98s]  Keep going.
[4947.98s -> 4948.46s]  Keep driving.
[4948.46s -> 4948.86s]  Keep driving.
[4948.86s -> 4949.26s]  Keep driving.
[4949.26s -> 4949.66s]  Keep driving.
[4949.66s -> 4951.10s]  Hit that motherfucker so he doesn't kill me.
[4951.82s -> 4953.10s]  Get him.
[4957.99s -> 4958.79s]  Oh, my God.
[4958.79s -> 4959.67s]  There's a guy.
[4959.67s -> 4960.23s]  OK, hold on.
[4960.23s -> 4961.27s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4961.27s -> 4961.67s]  I'm fine.
[4961.67s -> 4962.07s]  Where's the gun?
[4962.07s -> 4962.79s]  I have a gun, don't I?
[4963.67s -> 4964.39s]  I didn't use the gun.
[4968.62s -> 4969.90s]  R plus mouse.
[4969.90s -> 4970.14s]  What?
[4971.43s -> 4972.31s]  Brake barrel.
[4972.31s -> 4972.79s]  What do I do?
[4973.51s -> 4974.55s]  R plus mouse.
[4975.27s -> 4982.79s]  There's no bullets in this.
[4983.43s -> 4988.57s]  How do I use these?
[4993.08s -> 4993.96s]  Holy shit, I did it.
[5000.54s -> 5001.34s]  What the fuck?
[5001.90s -> 5006.09s]  OK, reload.
[5006.09s -> 5012.76s]  He's still alive.
[5025.53s -> 5026.17s]  Fuck you.
[5026.17s -> 5026.49s]  All right.
[5026.49s -> 5027.13s]  Go, go, go.
[5027.13s -> 5028.09s]  Where's the car?
[5028.09s -> 5043.08s]  I have 198 shots to fucking kill it.
[5043.08s -> 5043.64s]  God.
[5043.64s -> 5044.04s]  OK.
[5044.04s -> 5044.84s]  Where's my car?
[5045.40s -> 5048.26s]  Come on, I don't have a tire.
[5048.90s -> 5049.86s]  I don't have a tire.
[5050.50s -> 5051.64s]  It's getting dark.
[5051.64s -> 5052.52s]  I can sleep in the car.
[5053.16s -> 5057.99s]  Oh, thank God.
[5057.99s -> 5058.87s]  Get me in.
[5058.87s -> 5060.31s]  Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
[5060.31s -> 5060.95s]  Where's the front?
[5060.95s -> 5061.51s]  I can't tell.
[5062.31s -> 5063.67s]  Where's the front door?
[5063.67s -> 5064.55s]  I don't care where it is.
[5064.55s -> 5065.03s]  Just get in.
[5065.75s -> 5067.11s]  Get in, get in, get in.
[5067.11s -> 5068.23s]  Sit, sit.
[5072.34s -> 5073.22s]  There are no lights.
[5073.78s -> 5075.72s]  It's OK.
[5075.72s -> 5076.44s]  I'm going to be fine.
[5077.00s -> 5085.67s]  The car is rolling.
[5085.67s -> 5085.99s]  OK.
[5087.16s -> 5087.48s]  OK.
[5088.04s -> 5092.66s]  So, I got oil.
[5092.66s -> 5094.28s]  I got...
[5094.28s -> 5095.56s]  Can we stop the car?
[5101.32s -> 5101.96s]  Oh, boy.
[5101.96s -> 5102.76s]  Oh, boy.
[5102.76s -> 5105.70s]  I got to push this.
[5105.70s -> 5108.04s]  Why is this shit in here?
[5108.04s -> 5109.40s]  Why do I keep shitting in my car?
[5109.40s -> 5112.74s]  It doesn't make any...
[5112.74s -> 5113.46s]  All right.
[5113.46s -> 5114.90s]  I've got to push this thing.
[5114.90s -> 5122.17s]  How do I hold on to it and push and steer?
[5122.17s -> 5143.43s]  That works.
[5154.18s -> 5154.74s]  Get me in the car.
[5154.74s -> 5155.38s]  Get me in.
[5155.38s -> 5158.18s]  I just need to push it so I can steer it.
[5158.18s -> 5169.86s]  OK.
[5169.86s -> 5170.66s]  Get it back on the road.
[5170.66s -> 5171.46s]  That's all I care about.
[5196.39s -> 5197.19s]  The handbrake.
[5197.19s -> 5197.83s]  Put it in...
[5197.83s -> 5206.90s]  What?
[5206.90s -> 5207.70s]  It's in park.
[5209.22s -> 5211.29s]  Oh, fuck.
[5211.29s -> 5211.61s]  OK.
[5211.61s -> 5218.98s]  Then I got to get in while it's still going.
[5218.98s -> 5220.50s]  You don't think I'll be able to do this shit?
[5220.50s -> 5225.62s]  Oh, yes, I will.
[5225.62s -> 5226.26s]  Hey.
[5226.26s -> 5231.40s]  All right.
[5231.40s -> 5232.28s]  Where's the tire?
[5232.28s -> 5235.38s]  No, no, no, no.
[5235.38s -> 5237.70s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[5237.70s -> 5238.34s]  Get back over here.
[5243.26s -> 5243.66s]  Come here.
[5246.26s -> 5246.74s]  No.
[5246.74s -> 5248.10s]  Making it go faster.
[5251.66s -> 5253.18s]  I can't, dude.
[5253.18s -> 5253.90s]  Fuck this.
[5255.56s -> 5256.92s]  I'm going to be chasing this.
[5258.68s -> 5259.56s]  Just restart?
[5259.56s -> 5260.28s]  I don't have to yet.
[5260.28s -> 5260.76s]  I'm going to...
[5260.76s -> 5261.16s]  Don't worry.
[5261.16s -> 5263.56s]  I didn't go that far from that gas station.
[5263.56s -> 5264.12s]  I'll be OK.
[5264.68s -> 5268.87s]  I had to look in the fucking rear view mirror and be a dick.
[5275.10s -> 5275.42s]  OK.
[5280.01s -> 5280.95s]  Brake.
[5280.95s -> 5281.59s]  I'm ready.
[5281.59s -> 5282.55s]  Here we go.
[5282.55s -> 5284.15s]  Push and steer.
[5284.71s -> 5288.04s]  Where was it?
[5288.04s -> 5288.60s]  Come on.
[5288.60s -> 5289.32s]  Push and steer.
[5300.98s -> 5301.30s]  All right.
[5301.30s -> 5302.18s]  Which was the right way?
[5306.74s -> 5307.78s]  This way, right?
[5307.78s -> 5308.74s]  Or was the car accident?
[5318.94s -> 5319.42s]  Yeah.
[5319.42s -> 5319.98s]  Somebody just said it.
[5319.98s -> 5321.10s]  I can just Flintstone this thing.
[5321.10s -> 5321.58s]  I'll be fine.
[5331.40s -> 5333.00s]  Um, why did that happen?
[5340.89s -> 5342.33s]  Because I stepped on a rock.
[5342.33s -> 5343.45s]  Is that really what that was?
[5344.01s -> 5345.45s]  I tripped on a rock.
[5345.45s -> 5346.33s]  It's OK.
[5346.33s -> 5348.01s]  It's going to end up in the right spot anyways.
[5348.65s -> 5350.60s]  All right.
[5350.60s -> 5351.48s]  Can I just shoot it?
[5352.12s -> 5373.29s]  Stop.
[5373.29s -> 5374.09s]  What do you mean stop?
[5374.09s -> 5375.37s]  I have to.
[5375.37s -> 5379.18s]  I jumped to it again and...
[5380.63s -> 5381.03s]  Perfect.
[5381.59s -> 5386.15s]  I have to clean the blood off this thing.
[5389.70s -> 5390.42s]  Oh, shit.
[5390.42s -> 5408.18s]  There's one of those antelopes.
[5408.18s -> 5409.78s]  I'm so scared it's going to run at me.
[5409.78s -> 5428.06s]  I have to do this.
[5428.06s -> 5429.42s]  Otherwise, they're going to kill me.
[5429.42s -> 5436.04s]  All right.
[5436.04s -> 5436.68s]  No, they're running away.
[5436.68s -> 5437.40s]  We're fine.
[5437.40s -> 5448.54s]  Back to the road.
[5448.54s -> 5449.66s]  It's self-defense.
[5450.94s -> 5459.40s]  It's just running down behind you.
[5461.24s -> 5462.04s]  No, I'm good.
[5462.04s -> 5462.68s]  I'm good.
[5462.68s -> 5463.16s]  I'm good.
[5463.72s -> 5465.42s]  All right.
[5465.42s -> 5466.54s]  We're getting back to the road.
[5469.72s -> 5472.60s]  Does a spare tire in the trunk always bring a spare tire?
[5472.60s -> 5473.08s]  I know.
[5473.08s -> 5473.72s]  Exactly.
[5475.80s -> 5476.84s]  Always bring a spare.
[5477.56s -> 5482.30s]  Even if you're going down the street or behind you in real life.
[5482.30s -> 5484.76s]  Oh, the dog back there.
[5489.22s -> 5490.50s]  I've made it back to the road.
[5492.31s -> 5492.63s]  OK.
[5493.35s -> 5495.51s]  Now it's just a question of just be careful here.
[5495.51s -> 5496.23s]  Don't be an idiot.
[5496.87s -> 5506.26s]  Put it in brake.
[5506.26s -> 5511.19s]  Get that spare tire.
[5511.19s -> 5511.43s]  Yeah.
[5511.43s -> 5514.95s]  Gold sure is worth a lot right now, isn't it?
[5514.95s -> 5516.63s]  What can I do with gold right now?
[5516.63s -> 5524.90s]  I could be the richest man on all of the earth.
[5524.90s -> 5526.42s]  If I don't have a spare tire, I'm dead.
[5539.32s -> 5539.64s]  OK.
[5553.30s -> 5559.58s]  Now what?
[5559.58s -> 5561.34s]  I just have to make it to a gas station.
[5561.34s -> 5561.90s]  I'll be OK.
[5567.59s -> 5569.35s]  I don't even know what happened.
[5569.35s -> 5570.15s]  What happened?
[5575.98s -> 5576.38s]  What happened?
[5576.38s -> 5577.18s]  I didn't do anything.
[5577.18s -> 5577.82s]  I just ran.
[5578.38s -> 5584.33s]  I'm better off just walking.
[5588.15s -> 5589.91s]  Just abandon the car.
[5589.91s -> 5590.71s]  I can't.
[5590.71s -> 5591.19s]  I have to.
[5593.24s -> 5593.56s]  All right.
[5593.56s -> 5595.80s]  At least give me at least give me the gold bar.
[5597.10s -> 5598.22s]  Restart Roy.
[5598.22s -> 5599.66s]  No, I'm not restarting yet.
[5602.60s -> 5603.00s]  Not yet.
[5603.00s -> 5605.78s]  I'm not done yet.
[5605.78s -> 5606.34s]  Let's go.
[5606.34s -> 5606.50s]  Get.
[5607.14s -> 5620.38s]  Shit.
[5625.98s -> 5626.94s]  Where's the fucking road?
[5626.94s -> 5627.90s]  Where's the road?
[5627.90s -> 5629.46s]  What's on the front seat?
[5642.68s -> 5643.56s]  Just restart.
[5643.56s -> 5645.80s]  No, but it's I'm so close to the gas station.
[5645.80s -> 5651.77s]  I can feel it.
[5651.77s -> 5653.37s]  Look, I'll just do a Mario Kart skip.
[5665.37s -> 5665.85s]  All right.
[5665.85s -> 5666.09s]  All right.
[5666.09s -> 5666.33s]  Fine.
[5666.33s -> 5666.97s]  Fine.
[5666.97s -> 5667.37s]  Fine.
[5667.37s -> 5668.17s]  Fine.
[5668.17s -> 5668.73s]  Fine.
[5668.73s -> 5674.10s]  There's the road.
[5674.10s -> 5692.26s]  Road's right there.
[5692.26s -> 5693.78s]  Oh, oh my God.
[5693.78s -> 5695.46s]  He's starting to believe this is.
[5695.46s -> 5696.50s]  No, I'm not.
[5696.50s -> 5696.90s]  I don't.
[5697.78s -> 5698.66s]  I just want to.
[5698.66s -> 5702.60s]  I just want to get to another gas station.
[5702.60s -> 5703.64s]  Use the save state.
[5703.64s -> 5704.84s]  I don't have save state.
[5704.84s -> 5711.29s]  It doesn't have an engine.
[5713.10s -> 5714.30s]  Odd Watchers skip.
[5715.74s -> 5716.06s]  Don't.
[5717.30s -> 5718.90s]  You stay right where you are.
[5721.56s -> 5722.28s]  Open the hood.
[5722.84s -> 5727.27s]  If I open the hood, I can go faster.
[5728.09s -> 5729.29s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5729.29s -> 5730.81s]  If I just take this whole thing apart,
[5730.81s -> 5731.85s]  but leave the wheels on,
[5731.85s -> 5733.29s]  will I be able to run faster with it?
[5734.01s -> 5735.02s]  Is that for real?
[5739.94s -> 5741.46s]  Like if I just push a skeleton,
[5741.46s -> 5742.26s]  will that be okay?
[5742.98s -> 5752.25s]  I'm not going to mess with anything right now.
[5754.41s -> 5755.69s]  No, not messing with anything.
[5756.25s -> 5762.78s]  Just leave the car.
[5762.78s -> 5764.38s]  There'll be another one at the next station.
[5764.38s -> 5765.02s]  Yeah, I'm running.
[5770.66s -> 5771.70s]  Turn the radio on.
[5774.78s -> 5775.10s]  Okay.
[5776.06s -> 5777.58s]  No, don't tell me to do that.
[5779.50s -> 5780.46s]  This is the correct way.
[5780.46s -> 5780.94s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[5781.50s -> 5790.79s]  It's not even going that slow.
[5791.19s -> 5793.35s]  I'm probably running like 15, 20 miles per hour.
[5793.99s -> 5801.91s]  I'm just going to walk.
[5801.91s -> 5803.43s]  I'm just going to walk, whatever.
[5804.46s -> 5805.82s]  I'm just going to walk.
[5808.63s -> 5809.75s]  It's too fucked up.
[5809.75s -> 5810.71s]  It's too hard to do that.
[5811.51s -> 5812.95s]  Hey, maybe it'll meet me there.
[5813.59s -> 5816.02s]  What about the gold bar?
[5816.02s -> 5818.18s]  Money is useless in the apocalypse, dude.
[5818.74s -> 5823.18s]  That thing was so cool too.
[5823.82s -> 5825.37s]  It's all right.
[5825.37s -> 5826.09s]  I have my gun.
[5826.73s -> 5829.59s]  I'm ready for anything.
[5832.44s -> 5833.72s]  I drank a shitload of water.
[5833.72s -> 5834.12s]  I'm fine.
[5847.24s -> 5848.20s]  Get to the homeland.
[5850.17s -> 5852.09s]  There'll probably be one very shortly.
[5853.43s -> 5854.47s]  A long walk.
[5856.01s -> 5857.53s]  Restart, reload.
[5857.53s -> 5858.89s]  I think I'm in too deep right now.
[5858.89s -> 5859.45s]  I don't think I can.
[5867.00s -> 5868.28s]  All right, if there's not a gas station
[5868.28s -> 5870.20s]  within the next 60 seconds, I will.
[5870.20s -> 5876.01s]  If there's not a gas station on the horizon in 60 seconds,
[5876.01s -> 5879.03s]  I will restart.
[5879.03s -> 5880.23s]  Reload the gun, they mean.
[5880.87s -> 5882.68s]  All right, I got it.
[5897.21s -> 5899.69s]  Why did I have to look into the rear view mirror?
[5901.90s -> 5903.10s]  This game is really fun though.
[5903.10s -> 5904.30s]  It's just stupid.
[5904.94s -> 5911.14s]  Okay, hold on.
[5912.84s -> 5914.52s]  Is there a gas station on the horizon?
[5923.19s -> 5924.07s]  Hold on.
[5924.07s -> 5925.75s]  This is going to load up here in a second.
[5930.98s -> 5931.78s]  I got a hundred and nine.
[5931.78s -> 5932.02s]  Can I wait?
[5932.02s -> 5932.98s]  Can I sleep on the ground?
[5933.54s -> 5943.03s]  Turn up the draw distance.
[5943.03s -> 5943.83s]  You'll be able to tell.
[5946.57s -> 5947.45s]  Kill for food.
[5948.01s -> 5981.45s]  Oh, I'm making it to the gas station.
[5981.45s -> 5981.69s]  Fuck you.
[5981.69s -> 5982.65s]  I don't even care.
[5982.65s -> 5999.67s]  I'll sleep on the goddamn ground for all like it.
[5999.67s -> 6001.34s]  Wait a minute.
[6001.34s -> 6002.38s]  What's that down there?
[6002.38s -> 6003.18s]  Is that a tire?
[6003.18s -> 6004.22s]  Is that the car?
[6004.22s -> 6006.90s]  What is that?
[6006.90s -> 6012.65s]  Is that blood?
[6012.65s -> 6014.18s]  What's that over there?
[6014.74s -> 6015.54s]  What is that?
[6015.54s -> 6023.53s]  Come on.
[6023.53s -> 6025.29s]  Give me a gas station like right now.
[6025.29s -> 6028.82s]  Come on.
[6032.20s -> 6032.76s]  No.
[6032.76s -> 6033.32s]  All right.
[6033.32s -> 6033.80s]  Fine.
[6033.80s -> 6034.44s]  I know.
[6034.44s -> 6036.04s]  But that's like the whole point of the game
[6036.04s -> 6038.36s]  is not to just be like a restart Randy.
[6038.36s -> 6049.05s]  No, I got this.
[6049.05s -> 6049.37s]  I do.
[6049.93s -> 6050.25s]  Okay.
[6050.89s -> 6051.77s]  After this.
[6051.77s -> 6052.17s]  Okay.
[6052.17s -> 6054.01s]  One, two, three.
[6054.01s -> 6055.61s]  After the fourth street light,
[6055.61s -> 6057.45s]  if there's no gas station on the horizon,
[6058.09s -> 6059.18s]  I will restart.
[6061.00s -> 6061.80s]  There's one.
[6061.80s -> 6062.52s]  Here comes two.
[6063.24s -> 6075.26s]  What's that noise?
[6075.26s -> 6079.46s]  Somebody has one of those toys
[6079.46s -> 6080.58s]  that they're turning upside down though.
[6095.90s -> 6096.70s]  Donald Trump?
[6103.45s -> 6103.93s]  Excuse me.
[6104.89s -> 6108.70s]  All right.
[6108.70s -> 6109.26s]  There's two.
[6114.22s -> 6114.94s]  Here comes three.
[6122.86s -> 6123.10s]  No.
[6124.06s -> 6125.42s]  I don't want to restart.
[6125.98s -> 6127.90s]  No, no, no, no.
[6132.18s -> 6132.58s]  Whoops.
[6133.14s -> 6135.14s]  There's two.
[6135.70s -> 6149.14s]  Don't ever restart.
[6149.14s -> 6150.94s]  What's this?
[6151.90s -> 6152.46s]  Oh, shit.
[6152.46s -> 6153.02s]  Evidence.
[6153.02s -> 6154.14s]  I think this is where the car was.
[6154.14s -> 6158.01s]  Wait, is that my...
[6158.01s -> 6158.65s]  What is that?
[6158.65s -> 6172.39s]  I think we're close.
[6172.39s -> 6174.31s]  Do your Donald Trump as a cat again.
[6175.66s -> 6177.42s]  No, I don't even know what I did.
[6178.49s -> 6180.09s]  Look at all the resident sleepers.
[6182.57s -> 6183.05s]  It's like...
[6184.15s -> 6184.47s]  I know.
[6184.47s -> 6186.71s]  But look, I'm making progress.
[6186.71s -> 6187.19s]  Trust me.
[6187.19s -> 6187.59s]  I know.
[6187.59s -> 6189.11s]  I'm just trying to make progress.
[6191.18s -> 6191.58s]  Look.
[6191.58s -> 6192.14s]  Okay.
[6192.14s -> 6192.62s]  Let me...
[6192.62s -> 6193.90s]  I gotta be upfront with you.
[6193.90s -> 6195.98s]  The last stream I did was Super Monkey Ball.
[6196.62s -> 6199.82s]  And I save stated restart Randy'd
[6199.82s -> 6201.66s]  six or seven hundred times.
[6202.46s -> 6203.02s]  I gotta...
[6203.02s -> 6204.54s]  We gotta go to the other side here for a little bit.
[6205.18s -> 6215.54s]  Let's just do it three times this time.
[6215.54s -> 6215.78s]  Okay.
[6215.78s -> 6216.18s]  Hold on.
[6216.82s -> 6219.14s]  What is that?
[6219.70s -> 6220.70s]  I'm looking for...
[6222.58s -> 6222.98s]  Whatever.
[6228.78s -> 6229.42s]  I need the light.
[6235.82s -> 6236.06s]  Fuck.
[6238.36s -> 6238.76s]  No.
[6244.86s -> 6248.97s]  Pretty good in-game noises, don't you think?
[6262.66s -> 6262.98s]  Okay.
[6263.54s -> 6264.18s]  All right.
[6264.18s -> 6265.30s]  Okay, PUBG.
[6265.30s -> 6265.78s]  Okay.
[6265.78s -> 6267.46s]  Shotgun needs a little bit of fucking tuning.
[6267.46s -> 6286.79s]  Now, don't it?
[6286.79s -> 6288.15s]  Why can I not hit this thing?
[6291.45s -> 6291.77s]  What?
[6292.41s -> 6311.10s]  Okay.
[6311.10s -> 6314.57s]  I get it.
[6314.97s -> 6318.25s]  Just like all the people that complain about game mechanics like that,
[6318.25s -> 6321.14s]  it's usually their own damn fault.
[6321.14s -> 6323.43s]  I don't understand.
[6323.43s -> 6324.95s]  Like, what's with this hit-wrench?
[6324.95s -> 6325.99s]  You don't have any bullets.
[6328.54s -> 6329.02s]  All right.
[6329.02s -> 6329.90s]  But yeah, whatever, dude.
[6330.46s -> 6331.02s]  Time that guy.
[6331.02s -> 6331.74s]  I'll ban him.
[6331.74s -> 6334.23s]  I don't want that person in my chat room.
[6342.06s -> 6342.46s]  Fuck.
[6342.46s -> 6343.34s]  Come on.
[6343.34s -> 6345.61s]  I really do have to restart soon.
[6345.61s -> 6346.17s]  If I can't...
[6349.78s -> 6350.66s]  It's gotta be right here.
[6350.66s -> 6350.90s]  Right?
[6350.90s -> 6351.54s]  Come on, man.
[6352.10s -> 6355.02s]  This is so boring.
[6355.02s -> 6355.42s]  Please.
[6355.42s -> 6356.22s]  I'm sorry.
[6356.22s -> 6356.62s]  I know.
[6356.62s -> 6357.98s]  I'm working on it.
[6357.98s -> 6358.70s]  I'm working on it.
[6358.70s -> 6359.34s]  I'm working on it.
[6359.34s -> 6359.74s]  Trust me.
[6360.62s -> 6362.14s]  It's fucking Super Monkey Ball.
[6362.14s -> 6363.66s]  I didn't fucking have to restart the...
[6366.90s -> 6367.62s]  No, it's a mirage.
[6376.63s -> 6377.75s]  Press F4.
[6377.75s -> 6381.53s]  What did you just do?
[6381.53s -> 6384.26s]  Wait, what the hell is this?
[6386.58s -> 6388.10s]  You can just put a camera down?
[6396.41s -> 6397.29s]  Why?
[6397.29s -> 6399.69s]  That's so stupid.
[6399.69s -> 6401.05s]  I love it, though.
[6401.05s -> 6413.86s]  The vlog cam?
[6413.86s -> 6417.00s]  Hold on.
[6417.00s -> 6417.72s]  No, no, no.
[6418.95s -> 6420.42s]  Now, no.
[6420.42s -> 6430.22s]  Now it's a vlog cam.
[6430.22s -> 6430.70s]  Oh, okay.
[6430.70s -> 6432.06s]  Here we go.
[6432.06s -> 6436.98s]  No, I don't have time to do this.
[6436.98s -> 6437.78s]  I don't have time to do this.
[6437.78s -> 6438.66s]  I believe the camera there.
[6438.66s -> 6443.88s]  I don't have time.
[6443.88s -> 6445.80s]  You want like a four-minute bit right there?
[6445.80s -> 6446.60s]  No, no, no.
[6446.60s -> 6449.08s]  I have to find my way to a gas station.
[6449.08s -> 6449.72s]  Look.
[6449.72s -> 6450.84s]  I'll make everybody happy.
[6451.40s -> 6451.80s]  See?
[6451.80s -> 6453.24s]  You don't even care what happens now.
[6458.44s -> 6459.88s]  Wait, was I drinking my own piss?
[6461.10s -> 6461.34s]  What?
[6461.98s -> 6472.90s]  Am I going the right way?
[6472.90s -> 6473.62s]  Am I going the right way?
[6473.62s -> 6474.26s]  Am I going the right way?
[6474.26s -> 6474.98s]  Am I going the right way?
[6475.62s -> 6477.14s]  I just turned around like five times.
[6477.14s -> 6477.70s]  I don't know.
[6477.70s -> 6479.45s]  Is this the right way?
[6479.45s -> 6480.57s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[6480.57s -> 6480.89s]  I don't know.
[6480.89s -> 6481.69s]  Am I going the right way?
[6486.17s -> 6486.49s]  All right.
[6486.49s -> 6487.29s]  I mean it this time.
[6487.29s -> 6488.97s]  I really seriously mean this.
[6488.97s -> 6489.93s]  If I do not...
[6489.93s -> 6491.37s]  If after this rock formation right here,
[6491.37s -> 6492.33s]  there's not a gas station,
[6492.33s -> 6493.05s]  I'm going to restart.
[6493.69s -> 6510.09s]  Times two, ResidentSleeper.
[6510.09s -> 6512.97s]  Just you're going to feel so much better about this.
[6512.97s -> 6516.98s]  When I go back and there is a POG truck
[6516.98s -> 6519.22s]  that only spawned in this seed
[6519.22s -> 6520.50s]  and I found it, you're going to be like,
[6520.50s -> 6522.58s]  well, I'm so glad this motherfucker didn't restart.
[6523.22s -> 6524.18s]  You're going to be so happy.
[6524.74s -> 6526.18s]  You'll be like, oh my god.
[6526.18s -> 6527.38s]  I was telling him restart Randy.
[6527.38s -> 6528.82s]  I was going, restart Randy.
[6528.82s -> 6529.94s]  Andy, restart Andy.
[6530.74s -> 6533.38s]  And by the way, you're calling me restart Andy?
[6533.38s -> 6534.18s]  Restart Randy?
[6534.18s -> 6535.22s]  I haven't restarted once.
[6537.05s -> 6538.73s]  You call me walking Andy.
[6538.73s -> 6540.33s]  Walking Walter.
[6540.33s -> 6541.37s]  You guys got it wrong.
[6541.37s -> 6541.85s]  Come on.
[6541.85s -> 6542.49s]  You guys Twitch chat.
[6542.49s -> 6543.45s]  You're supposed to know these rules.
[6554.49s -> 6554.89s]  Okay.
[6554.89s -> 6555.61s]  It's coming up.
[6555.61s -> 6556.89s]  I'm about to restart.
[6556.89s -> 6558.36s]  It's going to happen.
[6558.36s -> 6559.88s]  I like this game though.
[6559.88s -> 6560.84s]  I'm here for a while.
[6560.84s -> 6561.64s]  I think this is fun.
[6568.49s -> 6569.05s]  Okay.
[6569.05s -> 6569.77s]  All right.
[6569.77s -> 6570.41s]  All right.
[6570.41s -> 6570.89s]  For real.
[6571.45s -> 6575.91s]  I know.
[6575.91s -> 6577.11s]  I can't have like half the stream
[6577.11s -> 6578.47s]  be me walking to a gas station.
[6578.47s -> 6579.03s]  You're right.
[6579.03s -> 6579.91s]  You're right.
[6579.91s -> 6580.23s]  Right.
[6580.23s -> 6580.63s]  How do I...
[6592.95s -> 6593.91s]  You can.
[6593.91s -> 6595.35s]  Okay.
[6595.35s -> 6596.07s]  You know what?
[6596.07s -> 6596.63s]  You guys got to...
[6596.63s -> 6597.91s]  The enablers in chat,
[6597.91s -> 6599.91s]  they're enabling me so hard.
[6599.91s -> 6610.07s]  You're almost there.
[6610.07s -> 6616.81s]  I'm probably not.
[6616.81s -> 6621.64s]  I see the gas station.
[6621.64s -> 6622.28s]  Where?
[6622.28s -> 6626.06s]  There's no gas station yet.
[6626.06s -> 6626.78s]  You're almost there.
[6626.78s -> 6630.46s]  Am I?
[6630.46s -> 6631.02s]  It's right there.
[6631.02s -> 6631.42s]  Right there.
[6631.42s -> 6631.90s]  Right there.
[6631.90s -> 6632.38s]  Right there.
[6632.38s -> 6633.02s]  Where?
[6633.02s -> 6645.90s]  Is that it right there?
[6645.90s -> 6649.37s]  Walking bus simulator.
[6649.37s -> 6650.89s]  Walking desert bus.
[6650.89s -> 6654.20s]  Now that would be a real, real game.
[6654.20s -> 6656.52s]  You know how people do like the desert bus thing
[6656.52s -> 6657.72s]  and you have to do the whole thing.
[6657.72s -> 6659.24s]  Imagine walking this whole thing.
[6659.24s -> 6664.86s]  Desert walk.
[6664.86s -> 6665.50s]  Yeah.
[6665.50s -> 6668.84s]  It just saved a checkpoint.
[6671.82s -> 6672.06s]  All right.
[6672.06s -> 6672.86s]  Come on, man.
[6672.86s -> 6673.26s]  Come on.
[6673.26s -> 6674.22s]  I don't want to restart yet.
[6674.22s -> 6674.70s]  Come on.
[6674.70s -> 6675.10s]  Please.
[6675.10s -> 6675.74s]  Right over here.
[6676.30s -> 6677.56s]  Right when I turn this...
[6677.56s -> 6678.36s]  This bank right here.
[6678.36s -> 6679.32s]  It's going to be right there.
[6680.04s -> 6683.83s]  Brink the oil to go faster.
[6684.39s -> 6696.84s]  Turns out that's a lie.
[6696.84s -> 6698.04s]  That didn't do anything.
[6698.04s -> 6702.30s]  All right.
[6703.96s -> 6707.06s]  Are there any nutrients in oil?
[6707.06s -> 6708.89s]  Somebody look this up.
[6708.89s -> 6709.53s]  Like if...
[6709.53s -> 6710.01s]  If I...
[6710.01s -> 6712.41s]  Because isn't oil like dinosaur bones ground up
[6712.41s -> 6714.17s]  and fossils and stuff in the ground and everything?
[6714.97s -> 6715.61s]  It's like all...
[6715.61s -> 6717.37s]  There could be some nutrients in there.
[6717.37s -> 6721.75s]  Oil is just the earth's blood.
[6721.75s -> 6731.24s]  What do you mean false?
[6731.24s -> 6737.26s]  It's the opposite of that.
[6737.82s -> 6739.74s]  It's like decomposed like soil
[6739.74s -> 6742.22s]  and then boogers and stuff
[6742.54s -> 6747.42s]  and old shit and piss and diarrhea and bones and jello.
[6747.42s -> 6748.94s]  All the old jello that they threw away.
[6748.94s -> 6751.50s]  It all turns into oil in the ground after like 600 million years.
[6765.32s -> 6765.88s]  Okay.
[6765.88s -> 6767.14s]  I have to pull the plug on this.
[6767.14s -> 6767.70s]  I got to restart.
[6769.35s -> 6770.63s]  I can't believe I did it for this long.
[6770.63s -> 6772.31s]  I'm so ashamed that I did it for this long
[6772.31s -> 6773.51s]  and I didn't see it to the end.
[6778.25s -> 6779.05s]  I'm ashamed.
[6784.58s -> 6785.54s]  You're almost there.
[6785.54s -> 6786.98s]  Get to that rock formation.
[6786.98s -> 6787.54s]  I can't...
[6787.54s -> 6790.54s]  I feel like that rock formation is permanently in the background.
[6790.54s -> 6791.90s]  I did tell you when I hit this bend
[6791.90s -> 6793.42s]  if it wasn't right here that I was done
[6793.42s -> 6794.70s]  and I was going to restart.
[6794.70s -> 6797.51s]  Come on.
[6797.51s -> 6797.91s]  Right here.
[6798.84s -> 6799.32s]  What's that?
[6799.88s -> 6801.32s]  We found...
[6801.32s -> 6801.72s]  Okay.
[6801.72s -> 6802.76s]  We've got something.
[6802.76s -> 6803.32s]  We got something.
[6803.32s -> 6803.72s]  We got something.
[6803.72s -> 6804.12s]  We got something.
[6804.12s -> 6804.60s]  We have something.
[6804.60s -> 6805.08s]  Something here.
[6805.08s -> 6805.48s]  What's that?
[6809.13s -> 6809.69s]  What is that?
[6811.53s -> 6812.97s]  I see something in the distance.
[6812.97s -> 6813.85s]  I see a tower.
[6813.85s -> 6814.65s]  I see like a...
[6814.65s -> 6815.77s]  Is that an oil tower?
[6817.37s -> 6819.53s]  There's definitely like a car over there.
[6819.53s -> 6820.57s]  We're good boys and girls.
[6824.66s -> 6828.02s]  Stare at this until you can't see anymore.
[6828.02s -> 6828.58s]  We're almost there.
[6830.82s -> 6831.78s]  We're so close.
[6831.78s -> 6832.18s]  Okay.
[6832.18s -> 6833.06s]  I'm happy now.
[6838.04s -> 6839.40s]  But how far away is that actually?
[6839.40s -> 6840.44s]  Get my gun.
[6840.44s -> 6845.59s]  Spawned in.
[6860.14s -> 6860.78s]  Holy shit.
[6860.78s -> 6861.66s]  Why do you have so many hits?
[6870.28s -> 6870.92s]  I might need this.
[6870.92s -> 6871.96s]  I'm going to take this from me.
[6871.96s -> 6881.82s]  Where'd it go?
[6881.82s -> 6883.32s]  Where'd it go?
[6883.32s -> 6890.23s]  There it is.
[6890.23s -> 6890.39s]  All right.
[6890.39s -> 6891.35s]  I'm going to hold it up to the sun.
[6891.35s -> 6893.35s]  I'm going to cook it with the sun's rays.
[6893.35s -> 6895.03s]  If I hold it here long enough,
[6895.03s -> 6897.93s]  it'll get like at least like internal temperature
[6897.93s -> 6899.21s]  of like 140 degrees, right?
[6912.25s -> 6913.13s]  You and me, buddy.
[6913.13s -> 6914.41s]  You and me are best friends now.
[6914.41s -> 6914.89s]  Come with me.
[6915.53s -> 6917.83s]  This is my Wilson now.
[6917.83s -> 6918.47s]  Wilson.
[6918.47s -> 6920.07s]  Do you see what's out there, Wilson?
[6921.26s -> 6921.98s]  It's a bus.
[6924.92s -> 6926.44s]  Can you believe it?
[6926.44s -> 6928.12s]  I can't even believe it, Wilson.
[6928.68s -> 6931.46s]  And you all wanted to restart Randy.
[6931.46s -> 6938.62s]  You're not going to get it from here.
[6938.62s -> 6939.82s]  He's just my shade.
[6939.82s -> 6941.02s]  He's my sunglasses.
[6942.09s -> 6943.77s]  There's a big bus over here.
[6947.19s -> 6948.95s]  You can do a better Tom Hanks.
[6948.95s -> 6951.10s]  Maybe.
[6951.10s -> 6953.42s]  I'm so happy that there's this huge bus over here.
[6955.45s -> 6956.17s]  Yes.
[6956.17s -> 6959.11s]  This thing is huge.
[6959.83s -> 6960.97s]  Okay.
[6961.53s -> 6963.02s]  So now what?
[6963.02s -> 6964.39s]  Does it need anything?
[6964.39s -> 6965.35s]  Do we have gas?
[6965.35s -> 6968.90s]  How tall am I?
[6968.90s -> 6971.51s]  Okay.
[6971.51s -> 6972.71s]  First of all, let me look up here.
[6973.27s -> 6975.11s]  There's a ladder here.
[6975.11s -> 6984.44s]  Can you get up there, please?
[6984.44s -> 6988.07s]  What's in there?
[6988.07s -> 6990.26s]  Bring this up.
[6990.26s -> 6994.50s]  Why can I not touch this?
[6994.50s -> 7003.51s]  Get it.
[7003.51s -> 7004.47s]  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[7004.47s -> 7005.03s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[7005.03s -> 7005.67s]  Get it, get it, get it.
[7005.67s -> 7007.16s]  I couldn't pick it up.
[7007.16s -> 7007.56s]  Draining.
[7007.56s -> 7007.96s]  It's draining.
[7007.96s -> 7008.36s]  It's draining.
[7008.36s -> 7009.16s]  It's draining right now.
[7009.16s -> 7023.24s]  How do I go down?
[7023.24s -> 7023.72s]  Stop.
[7023.72s -> 7031.94s]  Stop.
[7031.94s -> 7032.50s]  Oh, fuck.
[7032.50s -> 7034.36s]  There's a hole in it.
[7034.36s -> 7037.56s]  What is this, though?
[7037.56s -> 7038.12s]  Snow.
[7038.12s -> 7038.36s]  Stop.
[7038.36s -> 7039.56s]  Pick up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[7039.56s -> 7040.44s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[7040.44s -> 7041.32s]  What is in this?
[7041.32s -> 7049.08s]  Can empty whatever.
[7049.08s -> 7050.50s]  How do I get in?
[7050.50s -> 7051.38s]  Get me in.
[7051.38s -> 7053.99s]  How do I get in the car?
[7053.99s -> 7059.77s]  How do I get in the bus?
[7068.33s -> 7070.81s]  Push, push, push, push, push, push.
[7071.53s -> 7087.72s]  I don't understand.
[7096.54s -> 7097.82s]  Can I not get in this?
[7097.82s -> 7101.05s]  I won't even tell me that I walked all this way
[7101.05s -> 7104.15s]  and I can't get in this fucking bus.
[7104.15s -> 7105.75s]  Under the front bumper.
[7105.75s -> 7113.14s]  Smash the window.
[7114.10s -> 7123.40s]  Blind.
[7123.40s -> 7124.60s]  What do you mean blind?
[7124.60s -> 7128.50s]  Right there, right there.
[7128.50s -> 7130.06s]  What are you talking about?
[7130.06s -> 7130.70s]  Where?
[7130.70s -> 7133.99s]  You see a button on the bumper?
[7137.62s -> 7138.58s]  There's no button.
[7140.50s -> 7142.34s]  Where is there a button on the bumper?
[7142.34s -> 7143.38s]  What are you talking about?
[7143.38s -> 7144.34s]  Under the bumper?
[7145.78s -> 7147.14s]  What kind of car?
[7148.02s -> 7148.58s]  Why does...
[7148.58s -> 7151.08s]  What kind of dumb car is that?
[7151.08s -> 7152.60s]  Why do you have a hidden open the door
[7152.60s -> 7153.48s]  under the bumper button?
[7153.48s -> 7154.12s]  Why can't it...
[7154.12s -> 7154.52s]  What do you...
[7154.52s -> 7156.82s]  What?
[7156.82s -> 7158.18s]  All right, I'm ready.
[7158.18s -> 7161.42s]  Is there anything in here?
[7162.22s -> 7167.74s]  Okay, thank God.
[7167.74s -> 7168.38s]  Let's go.
[7168.38s -> 7169.42s]  Let's get the hell out of here.
[7173.83s -> 7175.19s]  Oh, thank goodness.
[7175.19s -> 7176.78s]  All right, how do I close the door?
[7176.78s -> 7184.66s]  Come on, man.
[7185.30s -> 7185.86s]  Come on.
[7186.87s -> 7187.43s]  Come on.
[7190.74s -> 7191.62s]  Come on.
[7198.28s -> 7198.68s]  Oil.
[7198.68s -> 7203.86s]  Oh, I have oil.
[7203.86s -> 7204.58s]  Okay, where does it go?
[7206.41s -> 7207.29s]  Why is the bus moving?
[7209.42s -> 7210.14s]  Why are we moving?
[7213.94s -> 7217.70s]  Is oil in here?
[7217.70s -> 7218.18s]  I don't know.
[7218.18s -> 7220.10s]  How do I open up the bus?
[7220.10s -> 7221.38s]  How do I open up the tank?
[7222.02s -> 7223.86s]  I've never driven a bus before, guys.
[7223.86s -> 7224.26s]  I don't know.
[7224.26s -> 7225.94s]  Where's the secret James Bond button
[7225.94s -> 7227.70s]  to open the fucking front hood?
[7227.70s -> 7233.40s]  It's in the back?
[7233.40s -> 7238.44s]  Okay, let's put this down.
[7239.00s -> 7245.14s]  Is there another weird button?
[7245.14s -> 7246.58s]  Side panels on the back?
[7252.33s -> 7253.69s]  I don't know how to open this.
[7257.99s -> 7258.87s]  Side panel?
[7259.51s -> 7264.57s]  There ain't nothing in there.
[7269.05s -> 7270.81s]  Shit, the fuel tank is empty.
[7271.45s -> 7272.33s]  It's empty.
[7291.43s -> 7292.47s]  Oh, fuck you.
[7292.63s -> 7294.01s]  You guys are not even...
[7294.01s -> 7294.89s]  He's fast.
[7294.89s -> 7295.53s]  He's fast.
[7295.53s -> 7296.17s]  He's fast.
[7296.17s -> 7296.97s]  He's fast.
[7296.97s -> 7307.46s]  Fuck, are you doing?
[7307.46s -> 7308.10s]  Fire.
[7308.10s -> 7321.13s]  I seriously...
[7321.13s -> 7322.17s]  I can't believe it.
[7322.17s -> 7325.54s]  Was it gas in that little tank that I shot
[7325.54s -> 7326.98s]  because I couldn't pick the fucking thing up?
[7327.54s -> 7330.34s]  All right, 3% oil.
[7330.34s -> 7332.58s]  It's 100% oil right now, but that's okay.
[7333.93s -> 7335.21s]  I'm so sad right now.
[7335.21s -> 7336.09s]  I can't believe it.
[7336.09s -> 7337.05s]  There's nothing in there.
[7337.05s -> 7338.17s]  Nothing at all.
[7338.17s -> 7339.29s]  Absolutely nothing.
[7339.85s -> 7342.17s]  I can't just like drip the drops in there.
[7365.64s -> 7366.28s]  Will that work?
[7366.92s -> 7368.68s]  Can you imagine if this is fucking turned on?
[7387.51s -> 7387.99s]  Why?
[7396.49s -> 7397.61s]  That's so sad.
[7399.50s -> 7404.44s]  Now I actually have to restart.
[7404.44s -> 7405.48s]  Check the panels?
[7405.48s -> 7406.92s]  Check the side panels.
[7406.92s -> 7413.67s]  Wait, there might be gas in these?
[7426.26s -> 7426.50s]  No.
[7427.22s -> 7427.70s]  Wilson!
[7428.58s -> 7429.38s]  Wilson, I'm sorry.
[7429.38s -> 7431.30s]  I'm running over your head right now.
[7431.30s -> 7431.94s]  It'll be okay.
[7445.00s -> 7446.98s]  Okay, I have to restart.
[7446.98s -> 7448.02s]  I have to restart.
[7448.02s -> 7449.14s]  I'm so sad to do this.
[7452.52s -> 7467.27s]  Check under the tower.
[7469.56s -> 7473.13s]  If there's nothing under here, I'm done.
[7473.13s -> 7474.01s]  That's so sad.
[7474.01s -> 7474.41s]  Oh well.
[7477.96s -> 7486.14s]  No, nothing.
[7486.14s -> 7516.82s]  Damn it.
[7516.82s -> 7523.08s]  I had to try.
[7523.08s -> 7525.06s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[7525.06s -> 7526.02s]  This is the real one.
[7526.02s -> 7528.60s]  What's the point of having that?
[7528.60s -> 7531.24s]  This is the real one.
[7531.24s -> 7533.24s]  Hey, Shimpa, thanks for the 20...
[7534.36s -> 7538.26s]  Okay, Shimpa gave 40 community subs.
[7538.26s -> 7541.93s]  Thank you for the insane amount of money, Shimpa.
[7541.93s -> 7545.78s]  Thanks for the 40 subs.
[7545.78s -> 7548.41s]  Of course, this car sucks.
[7548.41s -> 7551.35s]  Anything else back here?
[7551.35s -> 7553.75s]  Also, I think I got base burning already,
[7553.75s -> 7555.51s]  but thank you base burning for the five.
[7555.51s -> 7557.35s]  Thanks for the fucking 40 subs.
[7557.35s -> 7558.15s]  Can I call anybody?
[7558.71s -> 7561.26s]  You guys are giving stupid amounts of money today.
[7561.26s -> 7561.58s]  Thank you.
[7563.58s -> 7564.54s]  This is the only car that I got.
[7566.97s -> 7567.93s]  This is it.
[7567.93s -> 7571.18s]  Nothing else in all the secrets back here.
[7581.58s -> 7583.90s]  6,000 of you just thought that was the funniest thing
[7583.90s -> 7585.42s]  that's happened the whole stream.
[7585.42s -> 7587.42s]  And I'll take it because, you know, comedy is comedy,
[7587.42s -> 7588.62s]  even if it's not very good.
[7588.62s -> 7591.61s]  All right, what we got?
[7592.17s -> 7597.19s]  All right, this is water and gas.
[7597.19s -> 7600.25s]  This time, I'm not going to fuck around.
[7600.25s -> 7602.06s]  This is the real playthrough.
[7602.06s -> 7602.94s]  This is the real one here.
[7603.50s -> 7606.62s]  Fair tire in the back, good.
[7606.62s -> 7608.34s]  Get this in there.
[7609.06s -> 7610.42s]  Take the water too.
[7610.42s -> 7610.98s]  We might need it.
[7619.32s -> 7621.02s]  But we're good.
[7621.02s -> 7621.82s]  We're ready.
[7621.82s -> 7623.08s]  Fuel tank, is that 100%?
[7628.09s -> 7629.53s]  Oh, upstairs.
[7629.53s -> 7638.70s]  Okay, there's a rabbit.
[7638.70s -> 7639.42s]  Go upstairs.
[7639.42s -> 7640.54s]  How do I get up there?
[7640.54s -> 7649.86s]  Oh shit, there's a bucket here.
[7655.16s -> 7656.28s]  Who's trying to get in the window?
[7665.03s -> 7667.30s]  Windex, what is this?
[7669.66s -> 7671.26s]  Oh, it's a face mist.
[7671.26s -> 7674.52s]  What even is this?
[7679.54s -> 7693.53s]  What about in here?
[7693.53s -> 7694.65s]  Cool little like hobbit hole.
[7694.65s -> 7695.93s]  All right, let's drive.
[7695.93s -> 7701.38s]  Yeah, I just realized what I was just doing right there.
[7701.38s -> 7701.86s]  You're right.
[7703.99s -> 7705.67s]  Yeah, that was kind of weird,
[7705.67s -> 7707.59s]  but it was not what I was trying to do.
[7707.59s -> 7713.80s]  Let's go.
[7713.80s -> 7715.00s]  Time to really drive for real.
[7715.96s -> 7727.59s]  Get the diesel this time.
[7727.59s -> 7729.74s]  No, no, no diesel.
[7730.30s -> 7737.24s]  Can't even adjust this mirror.
[7737.24s -> 7737.72s]  There we go.
[7738.36s -> 7748.04s]  Stop.
[7748.04s -> 7749.16s]  I'm not going to do that.
[7749.16s -> 7750.52s]  I will not do that again.
[7750.52s -> 7752.52s]  I 100 million percent promise.
[7763.93s -> 7766.09s]  Thank God I dodged that accidentally.
[7766.73s -> 7778.78s]  Okay, this one, I'm going to get far on this one.
[7783.16s -> 7784.36s]  I can't help it, I have to.
[7785.08s -> 7788.39s]  How much gas do I have?
[7788.39s -> 7788.95s]  Not a whole lot.
[7789.51s -> 7793.53s]  Look at the fuel indicator.
[7794.17s -> 7796.02s]  Is that full?
[7796.02s -> 7797.86s]  Wait, that's left to right.
[7798.18s -> 7799.30s]  Right is empty.
[7799.30s -> 7800.34s]  In what kind of world is that?
[7802.74s -> 7803.86s]  Don't be a fucking idiot.
[7803.86s -> 7804.34s]  Slow down.
[7804.98s -> 7814.04s]  That's the fuel right there, right?
[7814.04s -> 7815.24s]  Oh, no, that's the fuel.
[7815.24s -> 7818.97s]  Okay, what the hell is that then?
[7818.97s -> 7821.98s]  B-O triangle, triangle?
[7822.70s -> 7836.38s]  Temperature, yeah.
[7844.62s -> 7845.58s]  Why is this camera in here?
[7845.58s -> 7846.70s]  Oh, it's because it's in the car.
[7847.50s -> 7850.10s]  Well, that's doesn't do.
[7850.10s -> 7851.70s]  That's not a good place to put it.
[7853.19s -> 7855.86s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7855.86s -> 7856.58s]  This is going to be cool.
[7856.58s -> 7857.08s]  Ready?
[7857.54s -> 7869.48s]  Here we go.
[7869.48s -> 7869.98s]  Let's go.
[7870.76s -> 7873.26s]  See you later.
[7882.54s -> 7883.04s]  Cool.
[7890.36s -> 7891.24s]  Come back.
[7891.24s -> 7892.60s]  I just dropped you guys off.
[7893.24s -> 7894.62s]  Good luck.
[7896.57s -> 7899.13s]  I just every 90s comedy movie'd you guys.
[7904.33s -> 7906.57s]  Oh, I got to walk in the fucking desert
[7906.57s -> 7908.73s]  for potentially two or three minutes.
[7909.69s -> 7911.13s]  And then somebody's going to pull up.
[7911.13s -> 7914.41s]  It's going to be a bus full of like cheerleaders.
[7916.12s -> 7916.62s]  No way.
[7922.60s -> 7923.10s]  Tower.
[7923.56s -> 7931.79s]  Where's that tower?
[7931.79s -> 7933.37s]  Let's get that off.
[7933.37s -> 7934.25s]  All right, where's the tower?
[7939.13s -> 7940.25s]  Let's go.
[7955.63s -> 7956.51s]  Let's go.
[7956.51s -> 7957.07s]  All right.
[7957.07s -> 7958.11s]  Do you want me to give you my best?
[7958.11s -> 7958.61s]  Let's go.
[7959.47s -> 7960.67s]  No, it probably hurt.
[7963.12s -> 7964.00s]  Nothing here.
[7964.00s -> 7966.32s]  But there might be a treat at the top of the tower.
[7969.95s -> 7974.46s]  No, no bus friends for us to be happy about.
[7974.46s -> 7975.82s]  All right, but there's something up there though.
[7977.15s -> 7979.71s]  Hopefully it's oil or fuel or gas or something.
[7979.71s -> 7980.43s]  Let's go.
[7980.43s -> 7981.15s]  Ow, my eyes.
[7981.79s -> 7986.99s]  All right, do you want me to like to like 14 year old Xbox live?
[7986.99s -> 7987.47s]  Let's go.
[7987.47s -> 7989.23s]  Or like 35 year old adult screaming?
[7989.23s -> 7989.95s]  Let's go.
[7989.95s -> 7998.18s]  14, okay.
[7999.50s -> 8000.86s]  Yo, let's go.
[8000.94s -> 8003.00s]  No, let's go.
[8004.12s -> 8006.52s]  You don't want to wake up anybody in your house,
[8006.52s -> 8008.04s]  especially like your parents or something.
[8008.04s -> 8023.12s]  If I drop this, is it going to break?
[8023.12s -> 8023.60s]  Easy.
[8029.71s -> 8030.59s]  All right, what's in here?
[8030.59s -> 8031.09s]  Gas.
[8031.71s -> 8034.19s]  It's 1.3 liters of gas.
[8035.07s -> 8037.48s]  Hey, go into the gas storage.
[8037.48s -> 8043.58s]  No, don't do that.
[8043.58s -> 8044.14s]  I want in here.
[8044.14s -> 8045.42s]  I got plenty of gas.
[8045.42s -> 8051.21s]  I'm going to be the guy that sells it to everybody.
[8051.21s -> 8054.41s]  And then be the guy who gets robbed and killed first
[8054.41s -> 8057.31s]  because you have all the stuff that everyone wants.
[8057.31s -> 8059.87s]  You can't just pull up like this in an apocalyptic scenario.
[8060.35s -> 8063.15s]  Okay, so that'll be $10 a gallon, please.
[8063.15s -> 8064.67s]  Nope, I'll take it all.
[8066.75s -> 8068.51s]  Oh, but my plan.
[8069.15s -> 8074.44s]  Chimpa just gave another 20 subs.
[8075.08s -> 8076.36s]  Chimpa, that's 60 on the day.
[8077.00s -> 8078.81s]  Holy shit, dude.
[8079.53s -> 8085.16s]  That's a fucking ton of money.
[8085.72s -> 8086.94s]  All right, which way is the right way?
[8086.94s -> 8087.90s]  I don't remember.
[8087.90s -> 8092.57s]  I think it's this left, right?
[8093.13s -> 8099.40s]  Yeah, it's like if you're the guy with like 500 cans of Campbell's soup,
[8100.64s -> 8102.72s]  500 people are going to show up to your house.
[8103.36s -> 8105.28s]  Uh, give me one of those.
[8107.69s -> 8108.97s]  No, okay.
[8109.05s -> 8110.81s]  I'll be back with 100 people to take them.
[8111.84s -> 8127.88s]  Oh, I had a minute.
[8127.88s -> 8129.00s]  I know I could do it in time.
[8132.80s -> 8134.24s]  No one likes Campbell's soup.
[8134.24s -> 8135.92s]  You don't have to like Campbell's soup.
[8137.92s -> 8141.05s]  You're going to eat it in an apocalyptic scenario.
[8141.45s -> 8142.65s]  I'm sorry, but if you don't...
[8142.65s -> 8144.57s]  Oh, I don't enjoy Campbell's.
[8144.57s -> 8146.57s]  I guess I'll die of starvation.
[8147.37s -> 8148.46s]  What was in the road?
[8148.46s -> 8149.10s]  What was in the road?
[8149.74s -> 8150.46s]  What was in the road?
[8151.18s -> 8151.98s]  What was in the road?
[8152.86s -> 8154.62s]  What was possibly in the road?
[8154.62s -> 8156.22s]  Oh, like a fucking trash bag.
[8156.22s -> 8157.66s]  Like a sleeping bag was in the road.
[8157.66s -> 8158.14s]  Okay, cool.
[8158.94s -> 8161.60s]  I lost a mirror.
[8162.16s -> 8167.15s]  I'm good.
[8167.71s -> 8169.77s]  Can I put this back on?
[8181.48s -> 8190.12s]  There we go.
[8190.12s -> 8191.00s]  We're fine.
[8191.00s -> 8192.20s]  Everything's fine.
[8192.20s -> 8192.76s]  Everything's fine.
[8192.76s -> 8199.87s]  Everything's fine.
[8199.87s -> 8200.67s]  Uh, what happened to the...
[8201.31s -> 8206.12s]  Why can I see through into my car's skeleton right now?
[8206.68s -> 8219.26s]  Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[8219.26s -> 8219.90s]  I can do it all.
[8219.90s -> 8220.54s]  I can do it all day.
[8229.60s -> 8230.56s]  Right, right, right.
[8231.28s -> 8232.88s]  What?
[8232.88s -> 8234.44s]  What's right?
[8238.16s -> 8238.88s]  There's a boat?
[8239.44s -> 8248.14s]  Is that a boat?
[8248.14s -> 8248.94s]  Is that what you're talking about?
[8249.50s -> 8251.45s]  What do you mean boat?
[8252.17s -> 8252.49s]  Left.
[8258.11s -> 8258.59s]  Oh my God.
[8258.59s -> 8259.15s]  Holy shit.
[8259.15s -> 8261.15s]  It's actually just like made out of like paper.
[8261.15s -> 8261.87s]  It's a plant.
[8261.87s -> 8262.27s]  I'm okay.
[8262.27s -> 8263.07s]  I'm fine.
[8263.07s -> 8265.63s]  I felt like I was going to go through the windshield from hitting a cactus.
[8266.27s -> 8269.82s]  I don't know why I thought that was like a cinder block.
[8278.54s -> 8279.90s]  Why is there a boat over here?
[8279.90s -> 8280.46s]  That's weird.
[8281.10s -> 8284.06s]  It's a battleship.
[8284.06s -> 8285.02s]  Yeah, that makes no sense.
[8285.58s -> 8286.64s]  Let's investigate.
[8287.28s -> 8297.45s]  I didn't do it.
[8297.45s -> 8302.75s]  Can I actually...
[8302.75s -> 8303.87s]  Dude, are there uh...
[8305.24s -> 8306.44s]  Is there like secrets in here?
[8312.51s -> 8313.55s]  Let's just live here.
[8314.03s -> 8314.99s]  We could, I guess.
[8315.71s -> 8322.73s]  There's a little place you can go in.
[8322.73s -> 8324.33s]  All right, I gotta get my gun.
[8324.33s -> 8327.42s]  This is probably a monster.
[8327.42s -> 8327.98s]  Holy shit.
[8327.98s -> 8329.42s]  Look at all that fuel in here.
[8329.42s -> 8330.06s]  I need to...
[8330.06s -> 8330.86s]  Do I have room for that?
[8331.58s -> 8346.01s]  I'm going in.
[8346.01s -> 8354.25s]  Pick up.
[8354.25s -> 8354.97s]  What is it though?
[8354.97s -> 8358.06s]  What's in here?
[8358.06s -> 8366.04s]  I can drink it, but what is it though?
[8366.04s -> 8366.68s]  Empty.
[8366.68s -> 8370.03s]  This is oil.
[8370.03s -> 8372.78s]  Shit.
[8372.78s -> 8374.06s]  I might need to take some of these.
[8374.06s -> 8376.06s]  Can I like siphon some of this?
[8376.06s -> 8378.30s]  Can I just dump it in the back of this seat and shit?
[8378.30s -> 8379.26s]  Can I take any of this?
[8379.26s -> 8382.32s]  That's a lot of oil.
[8382.32s -> 8383.04s]  Okay, hold on.
[8383.04s -> 8385.20s]  What's in this one?
[8385.20s -> 8385.60s]  Gas.
[8386.32s -> 8388.48s]  This is 57 liters of gas.
[8388.48s -> 8389.20s]  I have to take this.
[8391.32s -> 8397.18s]  I need to take all of these somehow.
[8397.18s -> 8397.90s]  Let's fill this...
[8397.90s -> 8399.42s]  Okay, we're gonna fill this car up completely.
[8399.42s -> 8405.37s]  We're gonna fill the whole tank.
[8405.37s -> 8406.09s]  All right, let's take it in.
[8406.09s -> 8407.77s]  Okay, this is gas, right?
[8407.77s -> 8413.02s]  All right, let's go.
[8413.02s -> 8415.79s]  Fill up all your other containers.
[8415.79s -> 8416.43s]  Holy shit.
[8416.43s -> 8417.79s]  I think we just hit the jackpot.
[8440.73s -> 8441.69s]  Can you get in?
[8441.69s -> 8443.72s]  Get in the car and drive.
[8443.72s -> 8444.52s]  Just run in front of him.
[8444.52s -> 8445.40s]  Run, run, run, run, run.
[8453.23s -> 8471.74s]  I'm going to bed.
[8471.74s -> 8472.62s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[8472.62s -> 8474.30s]  I left the lights on all night.
[8474.30s -> 8475.02s]  Is that bad?
[8475.02s -> 8477.47s]  I left the lights on the whole night.
[8477.47s -> 8483.92s]  That's not gonna be bad, right?
[8483.92s -> 8485.52s]  All right, pray that it's not a problem.
[8487.20s -> 8488.08s]  Thank God.
[8488.08s -> 8489.20s]  Okay, it turns off.
[8489.20s -> 8499.44s]  This is heavy.
[8499.44s -> 8500.72s]  How am I even picking this up by myself?
[8500.72s -> 8501.68s]  Can I just dump it in there?
[8503.26s -> 8505.26s]  We're gonna have so much gas and so much oil.
[8505.26s -> 8506.22s]  I'm gonna be rich.
[8514.96s -> 8516.16s]  All right, here we go.
[8516.16s -> 8518.86s]  Want this in here?
[8519.80s -> 8521.00s]  We were out of gas.
[8521.00s -> 8530.19s]  I didn't even know that.
[8530.19s -> 8531.15s]  Fill this whole thing.
[8531.71s -> 8539.82s]  As long as I don't run anything over,
[8539.82s -> 8541.74s]  this car could probably take me pretty far.
[8541.74s -> 8548.80s]  Sure, this is original shit car,
[8548.80s -> 8552.24s]  but I could take the doors off other cars and repaint it.
[8553.48s -> 8554.44s]  Don't forget the oil.
[8554.44s -> 8555.56s]  How much oil do I need?
[8556.28s -> 8558.00s]  3% oil, right?
[8558.72s -> 8561.08s]  3%...
[8561.08s -> 8563.00s]  Okay, 1% of 40 is 4.
[8563.64s -> 8564.76s]  4, 8, 12...
[8564.76s -> 8565.48s]  Hold on.
[8565.48s -> 8566.20s]  No, wait.
[8566.20s -> 8568.40s]  1% of 40...
[8568.40s -> 8570.00s]  Okay, now what?
[8570.00s -> 8579.24s]  That oil over here is the one, right?
[8579.24s -> 8584.86s]  Yep.
[8584.86s -> 8586.62s]  No, no, no, stop.
[8586.62s -> 8587.88s]  This is not a 2.
[8589.44s -> 8591.04s]  I don't know what that even is supposed to mean.
[8591.04s -> 8592.72s]  What do you mean this is not a 2?
[8592.72s -> 8594.24s]  Guys, I just go to the gas station,
[8594.24s -> 8596.24s]  put the thing in and just hold it down.
[8596.24s -> 8597.20s]  I don't even know what's in there.
[8597.76s -> 8603.48s]  It's just this makes your car move.
[8604.12s -> 8605.72s]  I don't know anything else about it.
[8605.72s -> 8611.36s]  So just gas.
[8611.36s -> 8614.32s]  It's not a two-stroke engine.
[8614.32s -> 8615.84s]  Do not put oil in the fuel tank.
[8615.84s -> 8629.95s]  Okay, saved.
[8631.55s -> 8635.20s]  This is a lot of gas too.
[8635.20s -> 8635.84s]  This is great.
[8636.48s -> 8639.58s]  And there's still more in here.
[8641.48s -> 8644.19s]  Oh, have you seen a full tank before?
[8644.19s -> 8645.44s]  Close that up.
[8645.44s -> 8648.52s]  Okay, what about in here?
[8648.52s -> 8650.83s]  So this is...
[8651.47s -> 8653.13s]  What's in there?
[8653.13s -> 8654.01s]  Is this water?
[8654.01s -> 8660.72s]  This is water.
[8660.72s -> 8662.00s]  All right, fuck this, just drink it.
[8662.56s -> 8679.07s]  How much is left in here?
[8679.07s -> 8679.71s]  3.3.
[8680.27s -> 8681.15s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[8681.15s -> 8682.19s]  You need water.
[8682.19s -> 8699.56s]  Oh, get out of here.
[8699.56s -> 8706.32s]  Okay, put this away.
[8706.32s -> 8707.12s]  Fill this up at least.
[8707.12s -> 8707.44s]  This is...
[8708.73s -> 8709.21s]  All right, here we go.
[8709.21s -> 8709.69s]  This is gas.
[8709.69s -> 8710.49s]  Let's fill the gas up.
[8712.01s -> 8713.13s]  Open the hood for the oil.
[8713.13s -> 8714.09s]  Yeah, I will.
[8714.09s -> 8716.49s]  Let's fill this up.
[8716.49s -> 8717.13s]  Is this...
[8717.13s -> 8718.57s]  How much is left in here?
[8718.57s -> 8720.33s]  Oh, plenty.
[8720.33s -> 8720.81s]  Okay, let's go.
[8720.81s -> 8721.13s]  Ready?
[8740.12s -> 8741.96s]  Mix water and gas to make a potion.
[8742.68s -> 8743.87s]  Stop.
[8743.87s -> 8744.59s]  What do you mean stop?
[8745.15s -> 8747.18s]  I'm filling this gas tank up.
[8747.18s -> 8747.90s]  What do you mean waste?
[8747.90s -> 8748.54s]  What are you talking about?
[8748.54s -> 8749.02s]  I got it.
[8749.02s -> 8749.82s]  I'm good.
[8749.82s -> 8750.83s]  I'm not missed.
[8750.83s -> 8751.63s]  What are you talking about?
[8752.19s -> 8757.63s]  All right.
[8757.63s -> 8758.43s]  Now it's spilt.
[8758.43s -> 8759.39s]  Now you spilled it.
[8759.39s -> 8760.11s]  Now you spilled it.
[8760.11s -> 8760.83s]  Thanks a lot, chat.
[8760.83s -> 8761.55s]  Now you spilled it.
[8769.21s -> 8770.09s]  God, I had it.
[8771.13s -> 8780.12s]  And then we're gonna put the oil in the front
[8780.12s -> 8781.40s]  and then we're gonna load up
[8781.40s -> 8782.28s]  and get the hell out of here.
[8782.84s -> 8786.51s]  I'm sorry.
[8786.51s -> 8786.91s]  I'm sorry.
[8786.91s -> 8787.87s]  I'm sorry.
[8787.87s -> 8791.28s]  You're not drinking water.
[8791.28s -> 8795.45s]  You're drinking coolant.
[8795.45s -> 8795.69s]  All right.
[8795.69s -> 8796.17s]  That's good.
[8796.89s -> 8798.73s]  That's filled up.
[8798.73s -> 8802.52s]  And you tell me don't...
[8802.52s -> 8804.52s]  I need the water for something eventually.
[8804.52s -> 8805.16s]  All right.
[8805.16s -> 8806.70s]  Well, this is gonna be fun.
[8806.70s -> 8807.74s]  Let's just do this.
[8807.74s -> 8818.17s]  I almost just died.
[8818.17s -> 8841.42s]  I was trying to do skeet shooting.
[8841.42s -> 8842.62s]  It doesn't even do anything.
[8843.26s -> 8844.78s]  Okay.
[8844.78s -> 8845.42s]  Oil.
[8845.42s -> 8852.80s]  Fill it up.
[8863.47s -> 8864.35s]  I don't know, dude.
[8865.63s -> 8872.59s]  Okay.
[8872.59s -> 8875.44s]  That's 100% coolant.
[8875.44s -> 8876.56s]  Oh, shit.
[8876.56s -> 8893.58s]  Okay.
[8893.58s -> 8897.48s]  We got 100% full.
[8897.48s -> 8902.27s]  Get out of the way.
[8902.27s -> 8902.99s]  I can't see this.
[8907.50s -> 8907.98s]  You dare.
[8909.00s -> 8909.88s]  Don't, please.
[8909.88s -> 8910.12s]  Okay.
[8910.12s -> 8910.68s]  Everything's full.
[8910.68s -> 8913.96s]  Close it.
[8913.96s -> 8914.68s]  I'm taking this.
[8917.39s -> 8917.71s]  Fuck.
[8918.88s -> 8920.24s]  No, there's still plenty of water in there.
[8920.24s -> 8921.04s]  Let's get a couple of sips.
[8926.88s -> 8927.60s]  All right.
[8927.60s -> 8928.00s]  Okay.
[8928.64s -> 8929.04s]  All right.
[8929.68s -> 8930.16s]  We're good.
[8930.96s -> 8931.92s]  It's time to continue.
[8931.92s -> 8932.72s]  But wait.
[8932.72s -> 8934.16s]  I'm gonna bring a barrel of this with me.
[8936.11s -> 8937.07s]  Find a water barrel.
[8942.54s -> 8943.34s]  Alcohol.
[8943.34s -> 8956.01s]  What do I need that for?
[8956.01s -> 8963.72s]  Do I need alcohol for something?
[8963.72s -> 8965.08s]  Water.
[8965.08s -> 8967.77s]  Alcohol.
[8967.77s -> 8968.25s]  Empty.
[8968.25s -> 8968.97s]  I'm looking for water.
[8968.97s -> 8972.00s]  I just want to fill my water tank.
[8972.00s -> 8972.40s]  Gas.
[8973.45s -> 8974.88s]  Water.
[8974.88s -> 8975.28s]  Oil.
[8976.92s -> 8977.32s]  Gas.
[8977.88s -> 8980.51s]  I probably can take one.
[8980.51s -> 8981.71s]  I could take one of these with me.
[8981.71s -> 8984.03s]  I'm gonna take one of the gasoline with me, at least.
[8984.03s -> 8989.16s]  Come on.
[8994.12s -> 8995.16s]  Take a keg with you.
[8995.80s -> 8996.12s]  No.
[8996.12s -> 8997.32s]  I'm not taking one of these kegs.
[8997.32s -> 8999.24s]  I'm gonna take one of those with gas.
[8999.80s -> 9008.91s]  That's gas and oil.
[9008.91s -> 9009.07s]  Okay.
[9009.07s -> 9010.27s]  That's a weird combo thing.
[9010.99s -> 9016.70s]  I'm not sure any of these can even be water.
[9016.70s -> 9019.72s]  I think it's just either gas, oil, or alcohol.
[9020.28s -> 9026.48s]  What the hell is this?
[9026.48s -> 9029.12s]  What is that?
[9029.12s -> 9030.43s]  Oh, it's a cactus.
[9031.55s -> 9031.87s]  Yeah.
[9031.87s -> 9032.83s]  Gas and oil.
[9032.83s -> 9033.15s]  All right.
[9033.15s -> 9034.19s]  I'm just taking one of the gases.
[9034.75s -> 9036.73s]  I'm just taking one of the big gas ones.
[9036.73s -> 9039.60s]  Which one?
[9039.60s -> 9040.64s]  There's one line here somewhere.
[9040.64s -> 9041.68s]  It was just all gas.
[9041.68s -> 9042.64s]  This one here?
[9042.64s -> 9045.42s]  This one here?
[9045.42s -> 9046.14s]  No.
[9046.14s -> 9048.80s]  Take the alcohol.
[9053.15s -> 9054.75s]  Do I need the alcohol?
[9054.75s -> 9055.15s]  Do I?
[9055.71s -> 9057.21s]  All right.
[9057.21s -> 9058.17s]  Well, this says 35.
[9058.81s -> 9060.75s]  This is the most so far.
[9065.23s -> 9066.03s]  I'm taking the gas.
[9066.67s -> 9069.12s]  I'm taking the gas.
[9069.12s -> 9070.32s]  It's more important to me.
[9070.32s -> 9072.64s]  Alcohol.
[9072.64s -> 9073.28s]  Take the alcohol.
[9090.84s -> 9092.68s]  Fix the alcohol and the gas.
[9092.68s -> 9095.20s]  I can probably fit them both.
[9097.28s -> 9098.88s]  I can probably fit them both.
[9102.24s -> 9103.44s]  I just drank it.
[9103.44s -> 9111.90s]  Shit.
[9111.90s -> 9114.62s]  Don't let them alcohol light you.
[9115.26s -> 9118.28s]  You're right.
[9118.84s -> 9123.39s]  I'm not even sure I can take any.
[9123.39s -> 9125.07s]  I don't think I could even take any, guys.
[9125.07s -> 9129.50s]  I don't think it's not going to fit.
[9129.50s -> 9129.98s]  I'll try.
[9130.62s -> 9132.09s]  Try the back seat.
[9132.09s -> 9132.57s]  I'll try.
[9132.57s -> 9133.69s]  Which of this one here has what?
[9133.69s -> 9134.41s]  Where is it right here?
[9136.32s -> 9136.64s]  All right.
[9136.64s -> 9136.96s]  This one.
[9136.96s -> 9137.84s]  Let's go.
[9137.84s -> 9140.80s]  Put it on the roof?
[9144.83s -> 9146.51s]  You're going to physics the fuck out of the car.
[9146.51s -> 9148.88s]  Yeah, that's a bad idea.
[9148.88s -> 9150.00s]  Can I mount it to something?
[9155.18s -> 9155.98s]  I don't think that's going to work.
[9157.88s -> 9158.76s]  Save the game.
[9161.61s -> 9162.25s]  Save.
[9162.25s -> 9173.64s]  Can I take the seats out?
[9173.64s -> 9175.47s]  All right.
[9175.47s -> 9176.75s]  Let's get slow down.
[9176.75s -> 9178.03s]  Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[9178.03s -> 9178.99s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[9178.99s -> 9179.95s]  Please, please, please, please, please.
[9179.95s -> 9180.11s]  Okay.
[9180.11s -> 9180.67s]  Take the door off.
[9189.05s -> 9189.85s]  I thought that was going to kill me.
[9189.85s -> 9190.97s]  I was about to be so annoyed.
[9191.53s -> 9192.01s]  All right.
[9192.01s -> 9192.33s]  Okay.
[9192.33s -> 9193.05s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[9193.05s -> 9194.33s]  We can actually do this now.
[9194.33s -> 9196.52s]  We just need to move some things around.
[9197.08s -> 9202.52s]  The spare tire is going to have to leave.
[9202.52s -> 9203.08s]  Sorry.
[9203.08s -> 9203.96s]  Useless.
[9203.96s -> 9209.84s]  Okay.
[9209.84s -> 9210.48s]  What is in here?
[9214.73s -> 9215.53s]  This is water.
[9217.92s -> 9218.32s]  Gas.
[9220.56s -> 9221.52s]  And is that oil?
[9222.08s -> 9225.16s]  I'd really like to pick that up.
[9225.16s -> 9235.39s]  Why can I not pick this up?
[9238.91s -> 9239.55s]  Pick up the oil.
[9259.07s -> 9259.39s]  Yes.
[9260.64s -> 9262.40s]  We might be able to get another one in here.
[9262.40s -> 9270.62s]  All right.
[9270.62s -> 9271.42s]  So what should I take?
[9271.42s -> 9271.74s]  The alcohol?
[9271.74s -> 9272.70s]  What should I take?
[9272.70s -> 9277.18s]  Like packing for a trip.
[9277.18s -> 9278.06s]  Hold on.
[9278.06s -> 9286.54s]  These are all sealed up, right?
[9286.54s -> 9298.65s]  Yeah.
[9298.65s -> 9301.32s]  Okay.
[9301.32s -> 9302.36s]  Take the tire.
[9302.36s -> 9305.68s]  Let me put it back together again.
[9305.68s -> 9314.73s]  Why is that?
[9314.73s -> 9315.13s]  What?
[9315.13s -> 9315.77s]  What's the?
[9315.77s -> 9318.30s]  We have lots of advice friends.
[9320.84s -> 9321.80s]  It's okay.
[9321.80s -> 9323.04s]  It's good.
[9323.04s -> 9324.08s]  No, I can't take the tire.
[9324.08s -> 9324.88s]  I'm not going to be able to fit in that.
[9324.88s -> 9325.12s]  Wait.
[9325.12s -> 9326.24s]  I can take the front seat out.
[9327.24s -> 9327.56s]  Wait.
[9327.56s -> 9329.08s]  Can I just take out both seats?
[9329.08s -> 9336.00s]  I can't.
[9336.00s -> 9341.20s]  No, I can't take the seats out.
[9341.20s -> 9341.60s]  All right.
[9341.60s -> 9342.72s]  I think I can still fit it.
[9342.72s -> 9345.31s]  So do I take the alcohol?
[9353.60s -> 9354.00s]  Yes.
[9354.00s -> 9354.48s]  Okay.
[9354.48s -> 9365.95s]  Give me the door.
[9365.95s -> 9366.35s]  Give me the door.
[9366.35s -> 9366.67s]  Give me the door.
[9366.67s -> 9367.39s]  Where's the door?
[9367.39s -> 9368.64s]  Where's the door?
[9368.64s -> 9369.44s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[9369.44s -> 9369.84s]  Give me the door.
[9369.84s -> 9370.80s]  Give me the door.
[9370.80s -> 9378.06s]  That's a couch.
[9378.06s -> 9385.44s]  Shit.
[9385.44s -> 9386.00s]  Okay.
[9386.00s -> 9411.15s]  I got it.
[9411.15s -> 9411.87s]  It was in there too.
[9411.87s -> 9413.47s]  I just couldn't put the fucking door on.
[9413.47s -> 9426.57s]  Just leave it.
[9427.53s -> 9435.05s]  But fuck it.
[9435.05s -> 9435.37s]  Let's go.
[9435.37s -> 9436.01s]  I have to leave.
[9436.01s -> 9449.87s]  Put it on.
[9449.87s -> 9452.67s]  Put on the stupid pain.
[9455.15s -> 9456.27s]  Come on, man.
[9458.46s -> 9459.74s]  Put it on.
[9459.74s -> 9460.94s]  You're killing me.
[9460.94s -> 9470.75s]  Put it on.
[9470.75s -> 9473.02s]  I gotta piss.
[9473.02s -> 9474.12s]  Give me a sec.
[9474.12s -> 9775.07s]  I'll be right back.
[9775.07s -> 9775.95s]  Oh, shit.
[9775.95s -> 9777.23s]  Viewers dropping.
[9779.37s -> 9780.01s]  Five minutes.
[9780.97s -> 9788.38s]  There ain't gonna be anybody left.
[9788.38s -> 9789.64s]  Shit.
[9789.64s -> 9790.60s]  Don't I know?
[9790.60s -> 9792.84s]  Don't ever go to the bathroom on stream.
[9792.84s -> 9794.80s]  Especially with the camera on.
[9794.80s -> 9797.74s]  I'm thinking, Jeremy.
[9797.74s -> 9798.46s]  Fucking idiot.
[9802.22s -> 9804.92s]  Somebody just wrote, fuck him.
[9804.92s -> 9805.56s]  Well, no.
[9805.56s -> 9806.52s]  I'm not gonna say that
[9806.52s -> 9809.87s]  because, you look, I'm not gonna...
[9809.87s -> 9811.95s]  Look, I'm at a BRB screen for five minutes.
[9811.95s -> 9813.68s]  Oh, I guess I'll wait.
[9813.68s -> 9815.04s]  No, there's other shit to do.
[9815.04s -> 9817.44s]  All right.
[9817.44s -> 9818.40s]  What was I doing?
[9818.40s -> 9823.07s]  Do I use a random number generator
[9823.07s -> 9826.12s]  to choose games?
[9826.12s -> 9827.21s]  All right.
[9827.21s -> 9828.97s]  That motherfucker right there
[9828.97s -> 9830.17s]  just almost turned on
[9830.17s -> 9832.09s]  Ratatouille for the Xbox 360.
[9832.09s -> 9834.03s]  I was about to press the button.
[9834.03s -> 9835.31s]  It was one second away.
[9839.63s -> 9840.75s]  But I'm gonna press it.
[9840.75s -> 9841.63s]  I think I'm gonna hold off.
[9841.63s -> 9844.22s]  Don't do it.
[9844.22s -> 9844.54s]  Okay.
[9844.54s -> 9845.10s]  Car tire.
[9848.01s -> 9848.81s]  Found.
[9848.81s -> 9851.12s]  You know what?
[9851.12s -> 9852.16s]  I'm just gonna do this in the morning
[9853.05s -> 9853.69s]  when I can see.
[9854.65s -> 9855.61s]  Just go to the fucking bed.
[9855.61s -> 9859.02s]  I'll do it in the morning.
[9859.02s -> 9859.66s]  Oh, cat.
[9859.66s -> 9860.70s]  There's an alien cat.
[9860.70s -> 9861.66s]  Oh, boy.
[9861.66s -> 9862.54s]  Oh, boy.
[9862.54s -> 9863.34s]  Oh, boy.
[9863.34s -> 9864.54s]  Oh, there's an alien cat.
[9864.54s -> 9865.42s]  I don't know where he is.
[9866.94s -> 9868.22s]  I don't know why I'm talking like this.
[9870.65s -> 9870.89s]  What?
[9870.89s -> 9871.69s]  Is the door open?
[9871.69s -> 9874.19s]  How many doors are open?
[9874.19s -> 9879.42s]  Okay.
[9879.42s -> 9881.26s]  If I don't move, he won't see me.
[9881.26s -> 9884.75s]  I'm not gonna die.
[9884.75s -> 9894.49s]  I'm alive.
[9902.14s -> 9902.94s]  Okay.
[9902.94s -> 9904.14s]  All the doors were open.
[9904.14s -> 9905.58s]  Well, that's great.
[9905.58s -> 9912.59s]  Let's continue what I was trying to do before.
[9915.40s -> 9918.20s]  Why can't this go on?
[9918.20s -> 9921.74s]  Oh, well, that's why.
[9921.74s -> 9922.78s]  It was dark.
[9922.78s -> 9923.82s]  Give me a break.
[9923.82s -> 9925.66s]  Well, you tried to do that shit in the dark.
[9925.66s -> 9931.96s]  Ain't gonna happen.
[9931.96s -> 9932.52s]  Good.
[9932.52s -> 9936.28s]  Should I take the chocolate?
[9936.28s -> 9936.52s]  No.
[9937.16s -> 9938.20s]  It's too much.
[9938.20s -> 9945.52s]  We're good.
[9945.52s -> 9946.64s]  We're completely loaded up.
[9946.64s -> 9947.44s]  I got gas.
[9947.44s -> 9950.12s]  I got alcohol.
[9950.12s -> 9956.11s]  Bring Wilson.
[9956.11s -> 9960.12s]  Wilson left.
[9960.12s -> 9960.44s]  All right.
[9960.44s -> 9961.24s]  Is everybody ready?
[9969.55s -> 9971.15s]  Back to the road, boys and girls.
[9971.15s -> 9972.03s]  Let's go.
[9972.03s -> 9975.79s]  Full tank of gas.
[9975.79s -> 9982.70s]  Whoever's texting me.
[9982.70s -> 9986.68s]  I can't talk to you.
[9986.68s -> 9991.84s]  Oh, we got to get back on the road, which is this way.
[9991.84s -> 10003.20s]  I don't like that view.
[10003.20s -> 10006.62s]  This is fine.
[10007.18s -> 10011.48s]  No, this is kind of how I sit in the car, like right here.
[10012.12s -> 10012.36s]  All right.
[10012.36s -> 10012.68s]  That's good.
[10014.62s -> 10015.34s]  Left, idiot.
[10015.34s -> 10017.18s]  I'm adjusting my shit.
[10027.32s -> 10028.36s]  No, that's one guy.
[10029.16s -> 10030.20s]  Ban that guy.
[10030.20s -> 10030.84s]  All right.
[10030.84s -> 10031.64s]  Ban that person.
[10031.64s -> 10032.28s]  Actually ban them.
[10034.44s -> 10035.16s]  We need to start.
[10035.16s -> 10037.96s]  There has to be consequences for one guy fuckery.
[10044.17s -> 10048.49s]  And then unban him and give him a $60,000 a year salary.
[10048.49s -> 10051.31s]  And then fire him.
[10051.87s -> 10056.76s]  And then invite him to your birthday party.
[10058.16s -> 10058.96s]  And then don't show up.
[10070.80s -> 10074.48s]  Yeah, a $60,000 a year salary working 12 seconds.
[10075.20s -> 10075.82s]  All right.
[10075.82s -> 10076.62s]  What's the math there?
[10077.72s -> 10079.72s]  Is it like 12 cents?
[10080.36s -> 10082.01s]  Where am I going?
[10090.72s -> 10091.52s]  Where's the road?
[10093.68s -> 10096.19s]  Go back to the ship.
[10096.19s -> 10098.19s]  No, I need to go back to the road.
[10098.19s -> 10099.23s]  I'm going to be lost.
[10099.23s -> 10100.27s]  I need a GPS.
[10100.83s -> 10102.27s]  I need like a compass or something.
[10102.99s -> 10104.03s]  Stop doing that.
[10104.67s -> 10107.23s]  It has to get out of my way.
[10107.23s -> 10107.87s]  I'll keep doing it.
[10108.43s -> 10113.85s]  Let's find the lampposts.
[10119.93s -> 10121.53s]  Wrong fucking way.
[10121.53s -> 10123.05s]  Rip, rip it off.
[10124.22s -> 10124.78s]  Good idea.
[10128.56s -> 10129.76s]  Now there's no distraction.
[10130.32s -> 10137.88s]  Where's this ship?
[10137.88s -> 10138.12s]  All right.
[10138.12s -> 10141.16s]  Yeah, I got to find the ship because the ship is going to give me a good indicator of where I am.
[10141.96s -> 10142.68s]  Okay.
[10142.68s -> 10143.80s]  So it's this way.
[10144.52s -> 10146.59s]  I don't know.
[10147.15s -> 10153.05s]  Turn on the radio for fuck's sake.
[10153.69s -> 10159.53s]  There's nothing on here.
[10161.26s -> 10161.66s]  Jesus.
[10162.30s -> 10174.84s]  I got plenty of gas to find the road, okay?
[10177.82s -> 10178.78s]  Your car sucks.
[10179.60s -> 10180.08s]  Oh, yeah?
[10180.72s -> 10182.17s]  Look at all the materials I have.
[10185.55s -> 10186.75s]  Turn fucking right.
[10189.90s -> 10191.10s]  Where's the road?
[10200.27s -> 10201.47s]  Smooth as silk.
[10204.48s -> 10205.92s]  Right, right, right, right.
[10206.64s -> 10214.64s]  Oh, I see it.
[10214.64s -> 10215.36s]  Okay, we're good.
[10215.36s -> 10215.92s]  I see the road.
[10235.37s -> 10244.60s]  I'm driving into the sun.
[10244.60s -> 10245.88s]  That's the road right there, right?
[10245.88s -> 10248.60s]  With all those lamps and all those things.
[10249.16s -> 10255.24s]  Am I leaving the map?
[10255.24s -> 10255.88s]  No, I'm right here.
[10255.88s -> 10256.60s]  We are right there.
[10256.60s -> 10258.04s]  That deserves one coffee sip.
[10258.68s -> 10269.16s]  Find somebody that can fucking do what I just did.
[10270.20s -> 10271.00s]  You never will.
[10271.00s -> 10272.52s]  I'm the only one that could have just done that.
[10272.52s -> 10273.32s]  Only person on earth.
[10274.12s -> 10277.26s]  Talk about my reaction time behind the wheel.
[10278.06s -> 10287.37s]  All right.
[10287.37s -> 10289.53s]  So is it left or right?
[10290.33s -> 10291.45s]  The correct road.
[10292.09s -> 10294.16s]  Which way?
[10294.24s -> 10294.88s]  Left or right?
[10299.36s -> 10300.24s]  I have no idea.
[10304.35s -> 10305.39s]  Right, MLG.
[10305.39s -> 10306.43s]  Right, MLG.
[10306.43s -> 10309.69s]  Is it 50-50?
[10311.36s -> 10314.56s]  Yeah, I'm getting kind of a lot of answers here that I don't know.
[10318.67s -> 10320.91s]  Left, then right, then mod him, then ban him.
[10330.81s -> 10331.13s]  All right.
[10331.13s -> 10331.85s]  Yeah, there's the boat.
[10344.03s -> 10345.55s]  Keep the poles on the right.
[10346.35s -> 10347.55s]  That's how you know you're going the right way?
[10348.27s -> 10351.60s]  I don't know how fast I'm going.
[10351.60s -> 10352.80s]  I don't have a speedometer anymore.
[10355.08s -> 10357.64s]  Tiny little rock in the road almost just ruined everything.
[10357.64s -> 10358.28s]  Slow down.
[10358.28s -> 10359.48s]  No reason to go that fast.
[10366.86s -> 10367.66s]  Go faster.
[10368.75s -> 10370.75s]  The faster I go, the faster this run ends.
[10377.02s -> 10382.97s]  Okay, one kilometer in American toddler-speak is what?
[10382.97s -> 10384.17s]  Two, three miles?
[10384.17s -> 10385.05s]  Two miles?
[10385.05s -> 10386.81s]  2.2 miles for one kilometer.
[10387.61s -> 10394.76s]  Oh, that's pounds to metric tons or something.
[10394.76s -> 10395.64s]  Was it pounds to?
[10396.36s -> 10397.08s]  What is 2.2?
[10397.08s -> 10397.80s]  2.2?
[10397.80s -> 10399.40s]  One kilogram is one pound.
[10400.44s -> 10401.16s]  Slow down.
[10401.80s -> 10405.26s]  Oh, pog car.
[10405.26s -> 10405.90s]  Pog car.
[10406.78s -> 10408.52s]  Wait, there's no...
[10409.24s -> 10411.68s]  I don't have a mirror.
[10427.36s -> 10428.32s]  All right, let's go back here.
[10428.32s -> 10429.20s]  What is over here?
[10429.20s -> 10433.24s]  Oh, get out.
[10433.24s -> 10434.20s]  What am I getting back in for?
[10435.60s -> 10437.76s]  Don't turn that back on, stupid.
[10437.76s -> 10440.80s]  All right, we have a yellow car.
[10441.52s -> 10443.04s]  It looks like it could be a little faster.
[10443.04s -> 10443.60s]  We also have a...
[10444.40s -> 10451.85s]  What is in here?
[10451.85s -> 10454.01s]  Okay, this is disgusting.
[10454.01s -> 10455.66s]  But I'm going to take the gold bar.
[10455.66s -> 10456.54s]  Like, this is just...
[10456.54s -> 10457.34s]  This is gross.
[10457.34s -> 10458.14s]  This is disgusting.
[10458.86s -> 10460.48s]  How would you miss that much?
[10460.48s -> 10461.36s]  Like, I don't know.
[10461.36s -> 10461.92s]  Are you like...
[10462.64s -> 10464.00s]  Are you sitting up here?
[10464.00s -> 10465.34s]  And then...
[10465.34s -> 10466.38s]  I don't understand how you do that.
[10468.22s -> 10469.50s]  Take the gold bar, though, for sure.
[10470.22s -> 10471.42s]  All right, what do we got in this car?
[10472.54s -> 10474.11s]  Good trunk space.
[10474.11s -> 10475.15s]  Okay, like it.
[10475.15s -> 10477.05s]  Take the gold.
[10477.05s -> 10482.76s]  Okay, what else we got?
[10482.76s -> 10485.00s]  Ooh, look at this leather interior.
[10485.00s -> 10487.85s]  We're going to change the doors out.
[10487.85s -> 10490.28s]  Ooh, nice leather seats.
[10490.28s -> 10492.24s]  This thing is shiny.
[10492.24s -> 10497.63s]  What do we got under the hood?
[10497.63s -> 10502.78s]  V6 with an injector, with a piston injection.
[10502.78s -> 10504.14s]  Really, really cool, actually.
[10504.14s -> 10510.32s]  All right, let's fill this up.
[10510.32s -> 10511.85s]  Definitely a better car.
[10511.85s -> 10514.41s]  Wait, what's inside of the weird, scary cement...
[10519.80s -> 10520.92s]  Ooh, a new door.
[10520.92s -> 10525.44s]  There's a blue door.
[10525.44s -> 10526.40s]  Who cares, though?
[10526.40s -> 10530.70s]  What is this?
[10530.70s -> 10534.97s]  Ooh, a new hood.
[10534.97s -> 10535.77s]  Put it on.
[10535.77s -> 10537.77s]  I can, but hold on.
[10537.77s -> 10544.67s]  Okay, turn the lights on.
[10544.67s -> 10545.31s]  Don't turn them off.
[10545.31s -> 10548.91s]  That hurts.
[10548.91s -> 10549.71s]  Use the new car.
[10549.71s -> 10550.51s]  I'm gonna...
[10550.51s -> 10552.08s]  What do you mean, idiot?
[10552.08s -> 10553.84s]  I'm gonna use the new car.
[10553.84s -> 10555.28s]  I want to make it look nice.
[10555.28s -> 10558.75s]  What's in here?
[10558.75s -> 10559.25s]  All right.
[10560.43s -> 10562.27s]  I don't get out of bed for more than three liters.
[10562.27s -> 10562.91s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10566.33s -> 10567.13s]  I couldn't be cool about it.
[10567.13s -> 10568.49s]  Let's just fucking waste it.
[10568.49s -> 10574.64s]  Okay, I might need this.
[10574.64s -> 10586.08s]  It's an emergency light.
[10586.08s -> 10586.96s]  How many times have you seen me go,
[10586.96s -> 10589.52s]  Whoa, I can't see anything.
[10589.60s -> 10590.00s]  All right.
[10590.00s -> 10597.87s]  What's in here?
[10597.87s -> 10598.35s]  Ooh, shit.
[10598.35s -> 10600.27s]  What's that?
[10600.27s -> 10600.83s]  No.
[10600.83s -> 10602.43s]  What's this?
[10602.43s -> 10607.93s]  Do you need any new dashboards in here?
[10607.93s -> 10632.27s]  It's so far away.
[10632.91s -> 10635.39s]  Why am I just such a fucking idiot?
[10635.39s -> 10637.15s]  It was so far away.
[10637.15s -> 10638.83s]  I'll make a sad explosion.
[10642.46s -> 10643.50s]  Wow.
[10643.50s -> 10645.98s]  I thought it was gonna be so much smaller than that.
[10645.98s -> 10646.86s]  Was it worth it?
[10646.86s -> 10647.10s]  No.
[10647.66s -> 10649.74s]  When was the last autosave?
[10649.74s -> 10651.74s]  Oh, thank God.
[10651.74s -> 10657.45s]  Thank God the game is understanding.
[10657.45s -> 10658.25s]  Holy shit.
[10658.25s -> 10659.53s]  That was awful.
[10659.53s -> 10660.01s]  I'm so...
[10660.81s -> 10662.09s]  Every emotion just happened.
[10662.09s -> 10671.32s]  What's this?
[10671.32s -> 10672.52s]  What's on her mind?
[10672.52s -> 10673.72s]  Free poster inside.
[10673.72s -> 10676.40s]  Oh, as if I get a poster.
[10676.40s -> 10682.52s]  1987 interview with the new rock star.
[10682.52s -> 10694.96s]  Yeah, I'll store it up there.
[10694.96s -> 10695.68s]  Just get me away from it.
[10695.68s -> 10696.16s]  I don't want it.
[10696.16s -> 10698.32s]  Okay, let's do some work here.
[10702.44s -> 10703.16s]  Where's the other car?
[10703.72s -> 10705.28s]  Let's bring this over here.
[10707.12s -> 10712.30s]  Use the old car back on the roof.
[10713.84s -> 10714.48s]  What is on the roof?
[10714.48s -> 10714.96s]  What is that?
[10715.92s -> 10724.00s]  What's that?
[10724.72s -> 10733.02s]  Wrong fucking way.
[10733.02s -> 10733.58s]  What?
[10733.58s -> 10737.88s]  What did I do?
[10737.88s -> 10738.12s]  Where?
[10738.12s -> 10740.89s]  How do they...
[10740.89s -> 10741.93s]  The bed.
[10741.93s -> 10744.96s]  Do I bring the bed?
[10751.26s -> 10753.95s]  Oil.
[10753.95s -> 10754.59s]  You know what I'm saying.
[10754.59s -> 10758.43s]  I don't even fucking get out of bed for more than...
[10758.43s -> 10759.07s]  Whatever.
[10759.07s -> 10762.11s]  What's this?
[10762.11s -> 10767.90s]  Rockboard?
[10767.90s -> 10768.54s]  Easel?
[10768.54s -> 10778.84s]  All right, nothing up here.
[10778.84s -> 10780.12s]  We gotta hurry this up though.
[10780.12s -> 10784.08s]  I need to fill the oil tank.
[10784.08s -> 10785.60s]  I got oil.
[10785.60s -> 10786.80s]  I got oil in this thing.
[10786.80s -> 10792.33s]  How do I smoke one of these cigarettes?
[10792.33s -> 10792.81s]  Can you?
[10792.81s -> 10794.52s]  What's the point of having this?
[10794.52s -> 10800.33s]  Use stave with the old car.
[10800.33s -> 10802.28s]  What do you mean use the old car?
[10802.28s -> 10803.40s]  This thing sucks.
[10803.40s -> 10810.54s]  This thing is gonna be faster and more efficient.
[10810.54s -> 10812.38s]  It has more storage.
[10812.38s -> 10818.59s]  Hey, but look at this.
[10818.59s -> 10819.88s]  That's stupid.
[10819.88s -> 10820.68s]  It's stupid.
[10820.68s -> 10823.31s]  It's not cool.
[10823.31s -> 10825.47s]  I can fit some of the gas tanks in here.
[10825.47s -> 10826.97s]  I'm gonna dump this whole thing.
[10826.97s -> 10828.54s]  This is gas, right?
[10828.54s -> 10830.67s]  Fellas.
[10830.67s -> 10833.31s]  Just check me out.
[10833.31s -> 10834.03s]  You can't.
[10834.03s -> 10834.67s]  You're stupid.
[10834.67s -> 10835.87s]  What do you mean no, you can't?
[10835.87s -> 10843.29s]  How much gas?
[10843.29s -> 10843.77s]  Oil?
[10843.77s -> 10844.33s]  Coolant?
[10844.33s -> 10846.67s]  Yeah, I'll be good.
[10846.67s -> 10847.31s]  You're stupid.
[10847.31s -> 10847.87s]  What the fuck?
[10847.87s -> 10849.07s]  You don't have oil.
[10849.07s -> 10849.63s]  Yes, I do.
[10852.32s -> 10858.48s]  This is gas, gas, and water.
[10858.48s -> 10860.06s]  I don't have any oil.
[10860.06s -> 10860.38s]  Okay.
[10860.38s -> 10861.50s]  I'm taking the fucking...
[10861.50s -> 10861.98s]  All right.
[10861.98s -> 10866.24s]  I'm taking all the cool stuff though.
[10866.24s -> 10871.96s]  It's too late to do this.
[10871.96s -> 10882.28s]  Get in and sleep.
[10882.28s -> 10883.48s]  Sleep in the bed.
[10892.56s -> 10893.20s]  All right.
[10893.20s -> 10898.33s]  Give me the gun.
[10898.33s -> 10898.97s]  Give me the gun.
[10898.97s -> 10904.19s]  All right.
[10904.19s -> 10907.79s]  The monsters are stupid in this game.
[10907.79s -> 10910.33s]  Okay.
[10910.33s -> 10912.89s]  Let me replace some of this shit.
[10912.89s -> 10913.69s]  I want some new...
[10914.94s -> 10916.06s]  Oh, look at that.
[10916.06s -> 10919.44s]  Wait, this was already on there.
[10919.44s -> 10919.92s]  There we go.
[10919.92s -> 10921.44s]  The nice blue, new blue one.
[10921.44s -> 10930.41s]  Nice.
[10930.41s -> 10931.05s]  Okay.
[10931.05s -> 10932.84s]  And then where's the other blue one?
[10932.84s -> 10936.65s]  Gross.
[10936.65s -> 10942.01s]  It's the new hood.
[10942.01s -> 10943.21s]  Is this the...
[10943.21s -> 10944.25s]  No, where's the blue hood?
[10944.25s -> 10956.48s]  Please take the new car.
[10956.48s -> 10957.68s]  Fuck what Chad is saying.
[10957.68s -> 10958.24s]  I can't.
[10958.24s -> 10958.96s]  I don't have any oil.
[10958.96s -> 10972.00s]  Why are my hands doing this, by the way?
[10972.00s -> 10975.47s]  I feel like I'm playing VR.
[10975.47s -> 10976.59s]  Why are my hands doing this?
[10976.59s -> 10990.57s]  All right, mount it.
[10990.57s -> 10996.52s]  I want this fucking thing.
[10996.52s -> 11003.13s]  What the hell?
[11003.13s -> 11004.17s]  Wrong door?
[11004.17s -> 11016.73s]  Well, what is going on?
[11016.73s -> 11019.53s]  Why can't I put this on?
[11019.53s -> 11020.33s]  Even if it's wrong.
[11020.33s -> 11034.49s]  Here we go.
[11034.49s -> 11037.80s]  Okay.
[11037.80s -> 11038.60s]  And then this is...
[11038.60s -> 11049.23s]  I need this door.
[11049.23s -> 11050.59s]  He's so high.
[11052.11s -> 11054.97s]  No, he's not.
[11054.97s -> 11055.69s]  He's not.
[11070.70s -> 11071.42s]  This sucks.
[11072.14s -> 11073.42s]  Can I take the bumper off?
[11073.42s -> 11077.39s]  Look at how nice this car is, though.
[11077.39s -> 11078.91s]  This is so sad.
[11078.91s -> 11083.69s]  Okay.
[11083.69s -> 11085.45s]  I need a door to...
[11085.45s -> 11120.32s]  I want this on the trunk, too.
[11120.32s -> 11120.72s]  Perfect.
[11120.72s -> 11120.96s]  All right.
[11120.96s -> 11121.68s]  That fits.
[11121.68s -> 11123.29s]  I just need a door over here.
[11123.29s -> 11128.30s]  I'm gonna eat the poop.
[11128.30s -> 11131.21s]  I want that person timed out
[11131.21s -> 11132.33s]  for at least five minutes.
[11132.33s -> 11141.08s]  There we go.
[11141.08s -> 11142.73s]  Okay.
[11142.73s -> 11144.57s]  It's a two-faced car.
[11144.57s -> 11146.72s]  All right.
[11146.72s -> 11147.20s]  What do you mean?
[11147.20s -> 11150.88s]  Like, Batman, Tommy Lee Jones.
[11150.88s -> 11151.92s]  What do you mean?
[11151.92s -> 11154.67s]  Barbie Dent from The Dark Knight.
[11154.67s -> 11155.31s]  Which one?
[11155.31s -> 11157.72s]  Probably that one.
[11157.72s -> 11159.16s]  Probably the Tommy Lee Jones one.
[11159.16s -> 11169.69s]  Take the new engine.
[11189.72s -> 11190.68s]  Holy shit.
[11198.96s -> 11199.84s]  Oh, it's oil.
[11199.84s -> 11201.74s]  All right.
[11201.74s -> 11202.38s]  Let's go.
[11202.38s -> 11204.38s]  I got everything I needed from here.
[11204.38s -> 11205.76s]  Three doors.
[11205.76s -> 11213.20s]  Give me that fucking thing.
[11213.20s -> 11214.24s]  I might find oil later.
[11214.24s -> 11225.79s]  Take the gold, too?
[11225.79s -> 11226.43s]  Yeah, I will.
[11226.43s -> 11247.53s]  This is heavy.
[11247.53s -> 11278.20s]  Wait, what about...
[11278.20s -> 11279.00s]  Sick.
[11279.00s -> 11279.40s]  Okay.
[11279.40s -> 11279.80s]  What about...
[11280.44s -> 11281.96s]  These are all corroded and shitty.
[11281.96s -> 11290.92s]  Tires...
[11290.92s -> 11292.28s]  It doesn't matter what tire is what, right?
[11296.17s -> 11297.93s]  It's just as long as the tire exists.
[11297.93s -> 11309.24s]  This one's ugly.
[11309.24s -> 11309.48s]  All right.
[11309.48s -> 11310.52s]  This one looks pretty good.
[11310.52s -> 11316.28s]  All right.
[11316.28s -> 11317.24s]  Which one's in worse shape?
[11317.24s -> 11319.48s]  Oh, definitely front tire right.
[11319.48s -> 11320.36s]  You know what I mean?
[11320.36s -> 11323.39s]  Front tire right looks like shit.
[11323.39s -> 11339.02s]  Why am I getting minus two for that?
[11339.02s -> 11339.26s]  All right.
[11339.26s -> 11340.14s]  Take the dashboard.
[11340.14s -> 11341.26s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11341.26s -> 11342.46s]  And the steering wheel.
[11342.46s -> 11345.15s]  And everything else.
[11345.15s -> 11346.75s]  Take the speedometer.
[11346.75s -> 11350.04s]  This doesn't even fit in my car.
[11350.04s -> 11353.52s]  All right.
[11353.52s -> 11354.64s]  What if I just leave it here?
[11354.64s -> 11360.89s]  Will it still work?
[11360.89s -> 11361.85s]  Just hold it.
[11364.03s -> 11364.59s]  No, I can't.
[11364.59s -> 11366.60s]  There's a hole in the...
[11366.60s -> 11372.78s]  Oh, hold it in your hand.
[11372.78s -> 11379.79s]  All right.
[11379.79s -> 11380.51s]  Here we go.
[11380.51s -> 11382.70s]  Does it work?
[11382.70s -> 11390.44s]  No, it don't work.
[11390.44s -> 11391.40s]  It looks kind of cool over there.
[11391.40s -> 11391.56s]  All right.
[11391.56s -> 11392.28s]  Let's move.
[11392.28s -> 11396.03s]  What about the radio?
[11396.03s -> 11396.59s]  I don't want...
[11396.59s -> 11397.07s]  Who cares?
[11397.07s -> 11397.39s]  I don't want...
[11402.27s -> 11404.43s]  Don't move.
[11404.43s -> 11411.32s]  Did this car just stall out?
[11411.32s -> 11419.98s]  I can't take the steering wheel.
[11419.98s -> 11421.42s]  I can't take the steering wheel.
[11421.42s -> 11426.65s]  Can I?
[11426.65s -> 11431.79s]  Review mirror.
[11431.79s -> 11432.43s]  Oh, shit.
[11432.43s -> 11432.91s]  Nice.
[11432.91s -> 11468.01s]  Okay.
[11468.01s -> 11468.57s]  It looks good.
[11474.35s -> 11485.13s]  Good thing out of here.
[11485.13s -> 11485.37s]  All right.
[11485.37s -> 11488.40s]  I need to get back on the road.
[11488.40s -> 11489.20s]  Radio?
[11489.20s -> 11492.83s]  All right.
[11492.83s -> 11493.71s]  It was this way.
[11493.71s -> 11496.38s]  I forgot about the bed.
[11496.38s -> 11498.06s]  I can't put the bed anywhere.
[11498.06s -> 11502.12s]  Was it this way?
[11502.12s -> 11503.16s]  No, it was the other way, wasn't it?
[11503.16s -> 11503.96s]  No, wait.
[11503.96s -> 11504.60s]  Wrong way.
[11504.60s -> 11505.24s]  Yeah.
[11505.24s -> 11512.88s]  Hole's on the right.
[11512.88s -> 11514.00s]  Right, right, right, right.
[11514.00s -> 11520.12s]  All right.
[11520.12s -> 11520.52s]  I'll try to...
[11520.52s -> 11521.48s]  I'm going to put the bed on the roof.
[11523.90s -> 11526.08s]  Fuck.
[11526.08s -> 11527.76s]  It's too involved.
[11527.76s -> 11540.03s]  Don't turn it on.
[11540.03s -> 11540.19s]  All right.
[11540.19s -> 11540.67s]  Where's the bed?
[11543.15s -> 11543.79s]  Save.
[11543.79s -> 11546.09s]  Um, I don't know.
[11546.09s -> 11546.41s]  Whatever.
[11546.41s -> 11547.13s]  Save right there.
[11547.13s -> 11550.01s]  Why does it...
[11550.01s -> 11551.85s]  Why do I have a negative seed?
[11551.85s -> 11565.34s]  You're infertile.
[11568.59s -> 11571.92s]  Can I actually put this on the car?
[11571.92s -> 11574.62s]  I mean, people do this shit,
[11574.62s -> 11576.14s]  but I don't have any bungees.
[11576.14s -> 11590.46s]  I think it worked.
[11590.46s -> 11595.52s]  And yeah, I'll just...
[11595.60s -> 11597.44s]  This is Snoopy's house.
[11597.44s -> 11598.84s]  When I get tired,
[11598.84s -> 11599.64s]  I'm going to get out of the car,
[11599.64s -> 11600.12s]  climb up here,
[11600.12s -> 11600.84s]  lie on my back,
[11600.84s -> 11601.80s]  and fall asleep.
[11601.80s -> 11617.79s]  Still up there?
[11617.79s -> 11623.15s]  Yeah, it's on there.
[11623.15s -> 11625.61s]  All right.
[11625.61s -> 11630.01s]  Back on the road.
[11630.01s -> 11630.89s]  The emergency light.
[11630.89s -> 11631.37s]  I don't need it.
[11631.37s -> 11632.09s]  I'm fine.
[11632.09s -> 11632.33s]  I'm fine.
[11632.33s -> 11633.77s]  I have all the nice supplies.
[11633.77s -> 11636.81s]  All right.
[11636.81s -> 11650.59s]  Hole's on the right.
[11650.59s -> 11651.15s]  Is there a horn?
[11661.37s -> 11661.69s]  H?
[11663.32s -> 11664.04s]  There is a horn.
[11666.64s -> 11666.96s]  Bed.
[11666.96s -> 11668.24s]  The bed, the bed, the bed, the bed.
[11668.24s -> 11669.20s]  Don't do anything idiotic.
[11669.20s -> 11669.52s]  Don't.
[11669.52s -> 11670.00s]  Okay.
[11670.00s -> 11670.48s]  Slow down.
[11671.12s -> 11674.86s]  I'm going to have to readjust this bed.
[11674.86s -> 11682.08s]  We've got to take the poop.
[11682.08s -> 11682.89s]  Okay.
[11682.89s -> 11684.01s]  In a different playthrough,
[11684.09s -> 11686.17s]  I would have taken every single shit I found
[11686.17s -> 11687.05s]  and put it in the front seat
[11687.05s -> 11688.33s]  until there's like 400,
[11688.33s -> 11689.37s]  just right here stacked up.
[11690.09s -> 11703.44s]  We could play highway to...
[11717.36s -> 11718.56s]  No damage at all.
[11718.56s -> 11720.12s]  Wait, what did I lose?
[11720.12s -> 11722.28s]  I lost a couple of dinner plates.
[11722.28s -> 11723.16s]  I put it back on.
[11723.16s -> 11771.92s]  What about the mirror?
[11771.92s -> 11780.86s]  I don't need it.
[11780.86s -> 11781.66s]  Rip mirror.
[11782.89s -> 11783.69s]  Click the link.
[11783.69s -> 11784.97s]  I can't right now.
[11784.97s -> 11786.17s]  When I get to another gas station,
[11786.17s -> 11786.97s]  I'll click the link.
[11786.97s -> 11789.32s]  How much gas does this car have?
[11789.96s -> 11791.08s]  I guess I can go out
[11791.08s -> 11792.20s]  and just reach my hand in
[11792.20s -> 11794.52s]  and see how far the line goes up my arm.
[11795.32s -> 11796.44s]  That's not going to help.
[11796.44s -> 11797.64s]  I can't fucking see.
[11799.08s -> 11800.44s]  Bed to bed to bed to bed to bed.
[11801.88s -> 11803.00s]  I can't see anything.
[11803.80s -> 11812.48s]  No, turn the fucking thing off.
[11812.48s -> 11813.20s]  Stop.
[11813.20s -> 11814.00s]  Do not.
[11814.00s -> 11817.68s]  Thank you.
[11817.68s -> 11818.56s]  Fuck the bed.
[11818.56s -> 11819.04s]  I need it.
[11819.60s -> 11820.88s]  I need it in about 10 seconds.
[11821.44s -> 11834.75s]  I wish I could tie it down.
[11841.52s -> 11841.92s]  Go on.
[11844.70s -> 11854.80s]  This is good.
[11855.44s -> 11857.96s]  This is the farthest I've ever been, by the way.
[11858.68s -> 11863.13s]  I've not gone further than this.
[11866.01s -> 11866.81s]  Grab it?
[11866.81s -> 11873.88s]  What did I just grab?
[11873.88s -> 11875.61s]  What the hell is this?
[11878.22s -> 11878.46s]  All right.
[11878.46s -> 11879.50s]  Where are my lights?
[11879.58s -> 11888.09s]  Why is the road so beat up right now?
[11894.25s -> 11895.13s]  Rip bed.
[11895.13s -> 11896.01s]  What do you mean rip bed?
[11896.65s -> 11897.92s]  It's still up there.
[11897.92s -> 11899.12s]  It didn't fall off.
[11899.12s -> 11900.40s]  I don't think it did.
[11907.93s -> 11917.48s]  I'm going to get hit by a rock.
[11917.48s -> 11918.68s]  I know it's going to appear.
[11918.68s -> 11919.32s]  I got to slow down.
[11929.87s -> 11930.59s]  It's not.
[11930.59s -> 11931.95s]  I don't think it's even funny anymore.
[11932.51s -> 11942.32s]  Just spam it.
[11943.60s -> 11946.52s]  No, I got to.
[11947.56s -> 11948.44s]  That's how you lose the bed.
[11949.16s -> 11950.14s]  How am I spinning?
[11950.78s -> 11953.16s]  That's how you lose the fucking bed.
[11953.16s -> 11953.48s]  Thanks.
[11954.20s -> 11955.16s]  Why did you tell me to do that?
[11955.80s -> 11959.23s]  Where's the bed?
[11968.40s -> 11972.16s]  Uh, the bed is long gone.
[11976.64s -> 11977.60s]  Go on.
[11977.60s -> 11978.08s]  Hurry up.
[11985.55s -> 11986.67s]  Buy a cactus.
[11986.67s -> 11987.31s]  What is this?
[11987.31s -> 11988.03s]  It's annoying me.
[11992.35s -> 11994.35s]  Why did I drive by?
[11998.30s -> 11998.80s]  You...
[12001.31s -> 12001.87s]  No.
[12001.87s -> 12003.15s]  How am I ever going to sleep?
[12005.82s -> 12006.38s]  All right.
[12006.38s -> 12007.82s]  I got to get the bed.
[12007.82s -> 12008.38s]  You're right.
[12008.38s -> 12009.42s]  I can't just leave it.
[12009.42s -> 12011.42s]  It took all the fucking trouble to go get it.
[12024.51s -> 12025.47s]  Where is it?
[12025.47s -> 12033.45s]  Where?
[12039.53s -> 12042.14s]  All right.
[12042.78s -> 12044.14s]  It's time to go to sleep anyways.
[12044.86s -> 12064.01s]  Get those lights off.
[12064.01s -> 12066.17s]  Leave the fucking bed, you pothead.
[12066.17s -> 12067.37s]  Why am I a pothead?
[12069.31s -> 12069.95s]  What?
[12069.95s -> 12076.41s]  Oh, wrong way.
[12076.41s -> 12078.17s]  Leave the bed, you pothead.
[12078.73s -> 12082.36s]  Okay.
[12082.36s -> 12083.00s]  Let's get in it.
[12083.64s -> 12084.52s]  Let's sleep.
[12084.52s -> 12089.53s]  Is this the wrong way?
[12090.09s -> 12095.31s]  I can't tell.
[12095.31s -> 12096.35s]  It's pitch black.
[12096.35s -> 12123.32s]  I really wish somebody could drive the car when I'm sitting here.
[12123.32s -> 12123.72s]  All right.
[12124.28s -> 12124.76s]  Don't worry.
[12124.76s -> 12126.92s]  A bed percent is still strong.
[12126.92s -> 12127.40s]  Don't worry.
[12140.86s -> 12141.50s]  Well, let's go.
[12142.14s -> 12154.14s]  The game is neat.
[12154.78s -> 12158.20s]  Yeah, I mean, this game started as an F.
[12158.28s -> 12161.80s]  It immediately became a D because one full letter grade for a car.
[12164.12s -> 12168.89s]  I mean, it's slowly climbed up to at least a C plus somehow.
[12172.73s -> 12173.69s]  Slow down.
[12173.69s -> 12180.24s]  The FOV is fucked.
[12180.24s -> 12181.04s]  Well, it's because I'm...
[12182.97s -> 12184.49s]  Don't tell me I'm fucked up.
[12184.49s -> 12185.05s]  Don't do it.
[12185.05s -> 12185.45s]  Just let it...
[12185.45s -> 12186.97s]  Just let the car do what it wants.
[12186.97s -> 12187.93s]  Don't fight that, okay?
[12188.73s -> 12200.88s]  If I tried to fight that turn, I would have flipped over.
[12201.44s -> 12210.56s]  That would not have happened with the yellow car.
[12211.20s -> 12212.48s]  It really might have, though.
[12213.28s -> 12218.91s]  I got plenty of gas.
[12218.91s -> 12220.03s]  I got all my materials.
[12220.03s -> 12221.23s]  This car is going to make it all the way.
[12236.64s -> 12248.60s]  That's how you style kill somebody.
[12248.60s -> 12249.80s]  Just like tailwhip them.
[12251.20s -> 12253.12s]  360 no scope with a car.
[12254.65s -> 12255.29s]  Sorry.
[12255.29s -> 12255.93s]  Excuse me.
[12255.93s -> 12257.05s]  A bed car.
[12258.27s -> 12259.39s]  Make sure we're accurate here.
[12259.95s -> 12262.67s]  What is that?
[12263.31s -> 12266.16s]  What's that thing on the left?
[12272.75s -> 12273.39s]  Airfield?
[12274.03s -> 12277.44s]  Is it actually an airfield?
[12278.54s -> 12279.90s]  There are no planes in this game, is there?
[12280.70s -> 12290.38s]  Oh, it's just a weirdly popping in cactus.
[12299.40s -> 12300.60s]  Plane car bed.
[12305.85s -> 12307.84s]  Just keep stacking shit on top.
[12308.56s -> 12314.22s]  We got a building right here.
[12314.78s -> 12317.23s]  Let's see.
[12318.40s -> 12319.44s]  All right, take it.
[12319.44s -> 12320.88s]  I'm going way faster than I...
[12321.60s -> 12326.44s]  When you zoom in like that,
[12326.44s -> 12338.81s]  you don't have any idea just how fast you're fucking going.
[12338.81s -> 12339.77s]  Bed joke again.
[12339.77s -> 12340.41s]  Minus two.
[12340.97s -> 12342.04s]  I just...
[12342.04s -> 12343.72s]  Look, I just want to get it to the next safe house
[12343.72s -> 12344.52s]  so I can put it in there.
[12349.44s -> 12350.24s]  I'm not trying...
[12350.80s -> 12352.08s]  I'm not trying to be funny.
[12352.08s -> 12352.72s]  I promise.
[12352.72s -> 12353.92s]  I want to do this.
[12355.52s -> 12356.00s]  This is...
[12356.00s -> 12357.84s]  Look, this has nothing to do with me making a joke.
[12357.84s -> 12360.48s]  This has to do with me wanting something.
[12360.48s -> 12370.27s]  I just want to get it over here.
[12373.20s -> 12373.68s]  What is...
[12373.68s -> 12374.80s]  Is this like a bus stop?
[12378.70s -> 12379.98s]  All right, this is where we're going to drop the bed.
[12381.76s -> 12383.28s]  Okay, you know like in like...
[12384.40s -> 12385.28s]  Spoilers for that...
[12385.28s -> 12387.36s]  What's the Kojima game that came out and everybody...
[12387.36s -> 12389.12s]  Okay, spoiler for Death Stranding.
[12389.12s -> 12389.68s]  Okay, ready?
[12390.49s -> 12391.85s]  I have to put this bed here
[12392.57s -> 12395.77s]  because I want to leave it for another player to come and sleep on the bed.
[12396.33s -> 12398.27s]  Isn't that how that works?
[12398.91s -> 12406.35s]  I just told you I was going to...
[12406.35s -> 12407.15s]  I just told you...
[12407.15s -> 12409.15s]  I'm warning that I was going to talk about Death Stranding for a second.
[12409.71s -> 12413.95s]  Oh, it's like a fort.
[12413.95s -> 12414.51s]  That's a...
[12414.51s -> 12415.15s]  That's pretty cool.
[12415.71s -> 12417.71s]  What's this?
[12425.32s -> 12425.96s]  A toilet?
[12426.52s -> 12427.00s]  Some sort?
[12427.72s -> 12428.28s]  This is nothing...
[12428.28s -> 12429.16s]  This is nothing even here.
[12430.28s -> 12431.00s]  Whoa!
[12431.00s -> 12441.69s]  That's a new radiator.
[12445.56s -> 12454.65s]  48 water, 34 oil, 18 alcohol.
[12454.65s -> 12457.60s]  Oh, look at this piece of shit.
[12457.60s -> 12459.92s]  This thing sucks.
[12459.92s -> 12460.72s]  Coolant tank.
[12460.72s -> 12461.36s]  Oh, wow.
[12461.36s -> 12462.64s]  100% water.
[12462.64s -> 12469.34s]  Not bad.
[12469.34s -> 12476.09s]  All right, I'm going to take it with me in case I need it.
[12476.09s -> 12496.80s]  I just have so many car parts in here.
[12498.00s -> 12500.64s]  This is just hoarding but with car vehicle parts.
[12500.64s -> 12502.56s]  Like, why do I have this speedometer that I can't even use?
[12503.12s -> 12505.87s]  What's the point of having this?
[12505.87s -> 12507.55s]  I have an engine that I can't use.
[12508.48s -> 12509.52s]  I have speedometers.
[12509.52s -> 12512.30s]  I have wheels left.
[12512.30s -> 12517.88s]  I can't use any of this shit.
[12518.52s -> 12528.20s]  Is it a tower?
[12528.20s -> 12532.43s]  There ain't no tower left.
[12532.43s -> 12533.07s]  What are you talking about?
[12534.44s -> 12535.00s]  Is that...
[12535.00s -> 12536.44s]  I mean, that's where we're going right now.
[12537.00s -> 12542.89s]  The goal is to go to that weird tea tower.
[12543.45s -> 12548.59s]  What is that?
[12548.59s -> 12549.71s]  Teen Titans tower.
[12550.27s -> 12551.21s]  Oh, wait.
[12551.21s -> 12554.17s]  Are we talking about Teen Titans original or Teen Titans...
[12554.81s -> 12560.01s]  Let's eat tacos and mess around in every episode.
[12560.01s -> 12560.81s]  We don't actually do anything.
[12560.81s -> 12564.32s]  We just eat tacos, right?
[12565.04s -> 12572.25s]  You know, it's like, let's fight that enemy versus tacos.
[12574.32s -> 12575.60s]  Which version are you talking about?
[12576.08s -> 12592.20s]  You'll never get away with this, Sandler versus ice cream party.
[12593.16s -> 12594.96s]  What's the guy's name?
[12596.56s -> 12597.04s]  Slap?
[12597.04s -> 12597.60s]  What's his name?
[12598.48s -> 12599.82s]  It's not Sandler.
[12599.82s -> 12601.10s]  I know, but what's his name?
[12604.57s -> 12605.13s]  Slade.
[12605.13s -> 12605.45s]  Yes.
[12609.15s -> 12610.19s]  Slap Sandler.
[12616.86s -> 12617.18s]  Boat.
[12620.03s -> 12621.71s]  Wait, boat or Teen Titans?
[12622.35s -> 12626.17s]  There's two boats.
[12626.81s -> 12630.25s]  Teen Titans?
[12630.25s -> 12630.49s]  Okay.
[12631.21s -> 12662.28s]  I don't want to smash into a rock both ways.
[12662.28s -> 12663.80s]  This actually looks kind of interesting.
[12663.80s -> 12666.04s]  This is the most interesting thing so far, this whole playthrough.
[12666.76s -> 12671.84s]  Please stop dri...
[12671.84s -> 12672.88s]  Okay, I can't read.
[12672.88s -> 12674.00s]  Please stop driving so fast.
[12674.00s -> 12674.80s]  It's terrifying.
[12675.44s -> 12677.20s]  I'm in complete control of this vehicle.
[12678.49s -> 12679.45s]  Don't worry.
[12679.45s -> 12690.91s]  Just avoid...
[12691.63s -> 12693.44s]  Damn, what is that thing?
[12693.44s -> 12703.36s]  Does the horn wear out?
[12718.43s -> 12719.23s]  5G.
[12720.03s -> 12721.31s]  Not a 5G tower.
[12722.03s -> 12724.84s]  You're alerting the horde.
[12736.32s -> 12736.72s]  Witch!
[12746.49s -> 12747.29s]  Am I going fast?
[12747.29s -> 12747.53s]  Yeah.
[12748.25s -> 12760.14s]  All right, let's investigate.
[12760.86s -> 12761.66s]  Off.
[12761.66s -> 12762.81s]  Brake.
[12762.81s -> 12767.00s]  Done.
[12767.00s -> 12768.96s]  I'm ready to go.
[12768.96s -> 12774.51s]  Don't go anywhere.
[12780.92s -> 12781.80s]  Well, okay.
[12781.80s -> 12783.80s]  You guys ever stand up to a really tall building?
[12783.80s -> 12785.24s]  Go like this and look straight up.
[12785.24s -> 12786.76s]  You will fall backwards.
[12786.76s -> 12788.28s]  Your body, it's like an equilibrium thing.
[12788.28s -> 12789.16s]  You'll fall all the way backwards.
[12789.16s -> 12795.80s]  Don't do it.
[12795.80s -> 12798.99s]  Your door?
[12798.99s -> 12800.46s]  Wait a minute.
[12800.46s -> 12801.10s]  What is this?
[12801.10s -> 12805.42s]  Why can I turn that?
[12805.42s -> 12808.22s]  What is the point?
[12808.22s -> 12812.33s]  This is a water tank.
[12812.33s -> 12812.57s]  What?
[12825.13s -> 12831.40s]  All right, turn it off.
[12831.40s -> 12834.92s]  Turn it off?
[12834.92s -> 12838.20s]  Oh no, I'm going to be the reason why the whole town runs out of water.
[12840.59s -> 12842.03s]  Smooth open close?
[12842.59s -> 12845.48s]  Let's take a shower.
[12872.99s -> 12875.15s]  This is going to be like really fucking weird.
[12875.71s -> 12877.77s]  Hold on.
[12877.77s -> 12879.37s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12879.93s -> 12880.57s]  Where's my bed?
[12881.37s -> 12882.41s]  Turn this off.
[12882.41s -> 12895.52s]  There's no monsters going to be there.
[12895.52s -> 12897.76s]  I know I left it at the bus stop.
[12897.76s -> 12898.08s]  It's okay.
[12898.08s -> 12900.08s]  There's no monsters over by the water tank.
[12900.08s -> 12905.98s]  Click on the spout.
[12905.98s -> 12906.86s]  Click on the spout.
[12906.86s -> 12907.26s]  I will.
[12907.82s -> 12916.51s]  I want it to be light out.
[12916.51s -> 12918.03s]  Fill the new coolant.
[12918.03s -> 12919.52s]  I could.
[12919.52s -> 12932.28s]  Can I just do the wicked fucked up thing that I think is not funny?
[12932.28s -> 12935.64s]  No one's going to think it's funny, but I will for one second or I'll regret doing it.
[12935.64s -> 12936.28s]  Let's find out.
[12939.40s -> 12940.68s]  Holy shit, those arms.
[12972.09s -> 12973.13s]  I can't see it.
[12973.53s -> 13011.20s]  That's not funny.
[13011.20s -> 13013.52s]  It's not funny at all, actually.
[13014.16s -> 13015.84s]  It's the complete opposite.
[13027.72s -> 13037.47s]  The water is running down my head and I'm drinking it.
[13037.47s -> 13038.27s]  That's enough of that.
[13038.83s -> 13039.63s]  That's enough of that.
[13039.63s -> 13040.83s]  Turn this shit off.
[13040.83s -> 13049.95s]  What else can I do with this?
[13049.95s -> 13050.91s]  Should I wash the car?
[13055.71s -> 13057.15s]  Crouch down and mouse scroll.
[13066.91s -> 13068.35s]  Why is this happening?
[13072.17s -> 13073.13s]  I'm like a gorilla.
[13073.69s -> 13093.50s]  All right.
[13093.50s -> 13094.14s]  That's enough of that.
[13094.14s -> 13094.54s]  Let's go.
[13095.10s -> 13095.60s]  I'm going to.
[13102.68s -> 13103.40s]  This thing was cool.
[13104.44s -> 13105.00s]  Can I climb it?
[13105.64s -> 13107.29s]  Just leave it running.
[13107.29s -> 13108.09s]  You're a monster.
[13110.09s -> 13110.89s]  You're a monster.
[13117.80s -> 13119.40s]  More, more, more.
[13119.40s -> 13121.47s]  The ladder on the other side, is there?
[13122.03s -> 13122.75s]  I'll see a ladder.
[13123.31s -> 13132.11s]  All right.
[13132.11s -> 13133.07s]  Well, that was cool.
[13133.07s -> 13135.98s]  Get out of here.
[13135.98s -> 13140.40s]  You just wasted 200 liters of water on a piss joke.
[13140.40s -> 13143.61s]  That's right.
[13143.61s -> 13144.25s]  I did.
[13144.25s -> 13147.71s]  And I would do it again, too.
[13149.36s -> 13150.24s]  You fucking kids.
[13150.88s -> 13164.89s]  Can I drink it out the window?
[13168.52s -> 13171.24s]  Wait, can I drink it out the window and piss out this window?
[13171.24s -> 13172.20s]  No, just go.
[13172.20s -> 13172.92s]  Just go.
[13172.92s -> 13173.32s]  Fuck it.
[13173.32s -> 13173.88s]  Who cares?
[13174.76s -> 13180.96s]  All right.
[13180.96s -> 13184.40s]  Now, I drove all the way in the middle of nowhere for this.
[13185.04s -> 13186.12s]  Where do I go now?
[13186.68s -> 13190.72s]  This way?
[13191.28s -> 13202.49s]  Over here?
[13204.92s -> 13206.44s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[13206.44s -> 13208.16s]  Over this way.
[13208.88s -> 13209.20s]  I think.
[13219.24s -> 13220.68s]  Coolint Omega Lull.
[13223.71s -> 13224.51s]  Go back left.
[13225.07s -> 13226.86s]  What the fuck is that?
[13226.86s -> 13227.98s]  Is that another?
[13227.98s -> 13229.66s]  Wait, there's another water tower?
[13231.16s -> 13231.80s]  Oh, shit.
[13231.80s -> 13232.52s]  There's another one.
[13233.08s -> 13234.56s]  And it's a boat.
[13235.20s -> 13261.31s]  Play X-Men Origins Resident Sleeper.
[13261.31s -> 13266.41s]  What are you talking about?
[13266.41s -> 13267.05s]  Same joke.
[13267.05s -> 13267.93s]  No, I'm not stopping.
[13268.73s -> 13270.57s]  Look, I'm just saying that there's one there.
[13270.57s -> 13278.16s]  Too fast.
[13278.78s -> 13279.72s]  Too fast.
[13279.72s -> 13280.44s]  Tree coming.
[13281.08s -> 13289.84s]  I can just dump the...
[13289.84s -> 13291.04s]  I can fill everything up again.
[13291.68s -> 13297.07s]  Why don't they put X-Men Origins?
[13297.71s -> 13299.68s]  Is that game any good?
[13305.87s -> 13306.51s]  No.
[13306.51s -> 13315.74s]  It's better than the movie.
[13317.82s -> 13318.06s]  All right.
[13318.06s -> 13321.90s]  Look, you only get one weird Xbox 360 request a month.
[13322.62s -> 13330.57s]  This thing is weighing the car down somehow.
[13330.57s -> 13337.71s]  Probably you're in the movies more.
[13337.71s -> 13338.99s]  I probably will eventually.
[13339.55s -> 13344.76s]  All right.
[13344.76s -> 13345.40s]  Let's get some gas.
[13346.04s -> 13352.04s]  Brake.
[13352.04s -> 13353.74s]  Okay.
[13353.74s -> 13356.14s]  How much gas is in this tank?
[13356.78s -> 13359.10s]  Turn off the headlights?
[13359.10s -> 13361.12s]  I'm fine.
[13361.12s -> 13362.32s]  Oh, my God.
[13362.32s -> 13363.28s]  We haven't even used...
[13363.84s -> 13366.72s]  We haven't even used two-tenths of a liter.
[13366.72s -> 13370.86s]  I might as well just throw a firework in here.
[13370.86s -> 13372.97s]  I might as well just shoot this.
[13376.52s -> 13377.96s]  What's the point of coming here?
[13378.60s -> 13378.92s]  All right.
[13378.92s -> 13379.96s]  We're going to blow this boat up.
[13383.48s -> 13385.24s]  I'm going to drive by and fire through there.
[13385.80s -> 13388.80s]  I'm going to get a safe distance away.
[13389.44s -> 13399.05s]  You need oil.
[13399.05s -> 13403.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[13403.66s -> 13403.98s]  Yep.
[13404.54s -> 13417.76s]  You can put the new engine in.
[13417.76s -> 13421.98s]  This is going to be such a pog moment.
[13421.98s -> 13422.62s]  I can't wait.
[13427.32s -> 13427.96s]  Wait.
[13427.96s -> 13432.00s]  Why does this engine look way cooler than this engine?
[13432.00s -> 13433.50s]  This engine...
[13433.50s -> 13442.92s]  This looks like Bowser's engine, and this is like Koopa's engine.
[13442.92s -> 13444.28s]  It's the same person kind of...
[13444.28s -> 13445.24s]  You know, the turtle.
[13445.24s -> 13447.31s]  New engine.
[13447.31s -> 13447.55s]  All right.
[13447.55s -> 13448.19s]  Let's get oil.
[13453.55s -> 13455.82s]  Oil.
[13455.82s -> 13456.38s]  Gas.
[13456.38s -> 13459.13s]  Nope.
[13459.13s -> 13459.53s]  Gas.
[13460.76s -> 13461.32s]  Alcohol.
[13471.87s -> 13472.75s]  Gas and oil.
[13472.75s -> 13474.91s]  I don't think there's a barrel of oil in it.
[13477.44s -> 13478.88s]  Diesel.
[13478.88s -> 13479.44s]  Oh, shit.
[13480.24s -> 13493.10s]  That's for a big one.
[13493.10s -> 13493.50s]  Nice.
[13493.50s -> 13494.14s]  Good.
[13494.14s -> 13498.14s]  All right.
[13498.14s -> 13500.78s]  Is this engine like a three, four stroke?
[13502.54s -> 13503.82s]  What par is this engine?
[13503.82s -> 13504.94s]  I don't know anything about this shit.
[13504.94s -> 13515.47s]  Am I doing this right?
[13515.47s -> 13516.27s]  That's it.
[13516.27s -> 13525.64s]  Sounds good.
[13525.64s -> 13526.76s]  Gap this up.
[13526.76s -> 13527.80s]  Let's get it in there.
[13527.80s -> 13537.39s]  Boom.
[13537.39s -> 13538.03s]  Nice.
[13538.03s -> 13542.48s]  Can I change this coolant tank to a better coolant?
[13542.48s -> 13550.67s]  I have that, right?
[13550.67s -> 13551.07s]  Somewhere.
[13551.87s -> 13559.39s]  All right.
[13559.39s -> 13559.79s]  Wait a minute.
[13559.79s -> 13561.93s]  This one is...
[13561.93s -> 13566.65s]  This is 48% water, 38% oil, 14% alcohol.
[13566.65s -> 13568.33s]  I feel like I'm going to fuck this ratio up.
[13568.33s -> 13574.80s]  Can I bring some oil and alcohol and water over here?
[13574.80s -> 13576.43s]  Dump it.
[13576.43s -> 13587.96s]  Why?
[13587.96s -> 13591.37s]  Just water.
[13591.37s -> 13592.41s]  Oh, okay.
[13592.41s -> 13593.21s]  I got water.
[13593.21s -> 13595.95s]  Let's not use our water though.
[13595.95s -> 13598.11s]  Let's use the house's water.
[13598.11s -> 13601.90s]  Is there water in one of these?
[13601.90s -> 13609.76s]  Pee is not going to work.
[13612.28s -> 13614.36s]  R slash water.
[13618.88s -> 13620.72s]  Pee is not going to work.
[13621.36s -> 13622.64s]  You're going to ruin this.
[13626.24s -> 13627.36s]  Just pee.
[13627.36s -> 13627.68s]  Okay.
[13627.68s -> 13630.72s]  If pee works, I will be very surprised.
[13630.72s -> 13660.36s]  It works.
[13660.36s -> 13660.76s]  Okay.
[13660.76s -> 13681.08s]  Well, I got to drink something.
[13681.08s -> 13681.72s]  Okay.
[13681.72s -> 13687.40s]  Am I not getting it in?
[13687.40s -> 13688.12s]  Why?
[13688.12s -> 13697.18s]  Wait, I'm peeing the oil out?
[13697.18s -> 13697.74s]  I need water.
[13701.18s -> 13702.06s]  Wait, there's water.
[13702.06s -> 13702.30s]  All right.
[13702.30s -> 13702.94s]  Where's the...
[13702.94s -> 13705.18s]  Wait, isn't one of these like alcohol, water, and gas?
[13707.63s -> 13711.45s]  My own filtration system.
[13711.45s -> 13712.57s]  One of these is...
[13712.57s -> 13713.21s]  Come on.
[13713.21s -> 13713.93s]  Come on.
[13713.93s -> 13714.41s]  Come on.
[13715.13s -> 13716.56s]  Come on.
[13717.28s -> 13718.43s]  Come on.
[13720.56s -> 13722.73s]  Come on.
[13722.73s -> 13723.21s]  None of these...
[13724.40s -> 13726.24s]  Oh, gas, oil, and diesel.
[13726.24s -> 13727.20s]  No, that's not what I want.
[13731.36s -> 13731.92s]  Empty.
[13731.92s -> 13732.96s]  Yeah, of course it is.
[13732.96s -> 13733.44s]  Get out of here.
[13735.84s -> 13737.36s]  Gas, oil, and diesel.
[13737.36s -> 13740.16s]  Get this out of here.
[13740.16s -> 13740.88s]  Oil.
[13740.88s -> 13743.92s]  What's this?
[13743.92s -> 13746.43s]  Look at the water.
[13746.43s -> 13747.96s]  Oil, no?
[13747.96s -> 13751.87s]  Gas, no?
[13751.87s -> 13754.11s]  What's this?
[13754.11s -> 13754.43s]  Empty.
[13755.36s -> 13755.76s]  Empty.
[13755.76s -> 13756.08s]  Fuck it.
[13756.08s -> 13757.36s]  I'm just going to drink the water.
[13757.36s -> 13761.47s]  What about that water tower nearby?
[13761.47s -> 13763.95s]  Yeah, well, I have to go drink and then pee into it.
[13763.95s -> 13765.76s]  I can't...
[13765.76s -> 13768.00s]  I mean, I guess we could just go do that.
[13768.00s -> 13777.72s]  Let me fill this up.
[13777.72s -> 13778.76s]  I have a water tank in here.
[13778.76s -> 13782.46s]  This one right here.
[13782.46s -> 13795.10s]  Okay.
[13795.10s -> 13795.74s]  Fill it up.
[13795.74s -> 13799.00s]  No, don't drink it.
[13799.00s -> 13800.20s]  I want to fill this.
[13800.20s -> 13817.84s]  That's all right for now.
[13817.84s -> 13824.35s]  Water, oil, and alcohol.
[13824.35s -> 13825.71s]  It's going to explode.
[13830.20s -> 13830.84s]  Where?
[13830.84s -> 13838.49s]  If I put this in here, is the car going to turn on?
[13838.49s -> 13845.16s]  Yes or no?
[13845.16s -> 13845.72s]  Yes.
[13845.72s -> 13847.79s]  I hope you're right.
[13847.79s -> 13852.57s]  I hope this engine is good.
[13852.57s -> 13852.81s]  All right.
[13852.81s -> 13857.07s]  We have a new engine and new stuff.
[13857.07s -> 13858.43s]  Oh, listen to that purr.
[13860.72s -> 13862.56s]  Oh, nice.
[13862.56s -> 13870.11s]  Wait, just sleep.
[13870.11s -> 13872.28s]  Turn the car off.
[13872.28s -> 13880.52s]  Turn the car off.
[13880.52s -> 13881.16s]  Car off.
[13881.16s -> 13885.47s]  The engine's not even on.
[13885.47s -> 13888.72s]  Okay.
[13888.72s -> 13889.20s]  What?
[13889.20s -> 13889.76s]  Go.
[13889.76s -> 13895.68s]  Still go.
[13895.68s -> 13897.36s]  Don't hit a rock.
[13903.29s -> 13903.61s]  Okay.
[13903.61s -> 13903.85s]  I'm good.
[13903.85s -> 13904.09s]  I'm good.
[13904.09s -> 13904.49s]  I'm good.
[13905.45s -> 13910.22s]  Oh, you know I have to fucking go like 80 miles per hour and sleep, right?
[13910.22s -> 13911.50s]  Like, I have to try.
[13912.30s -> 13922.60s]  Self-driving car.
[13924.76s -> 13925.80s]  Something actually moves now.
[13925.80s -> 13925.96s]  All right.
[13925.96s -> 13926.52s]  Where am I going?
[13926.52s -> 13930.08s]  Where the hell do I need to go?
[13930.08s -> 13930.88s]  The water tower?
[13931.84s -> 13932.72s]  It's so far away.
[13932.72s -> 13933.36s]  No, I don't care.
[13933.36s -> 13934.00s]  I need the road.
[13934.72s -> 13942.08s]  Get out of here.
[13942.64s -> 13943.84s]  Water tower.
[13943.84s -> 13944.64s]  I need the road.
[13944.64s -> 13945.12s]  I don't want any...
[13945.92s -> 13974.60s]  Back door.
[13974.60s -> 13975.08s]  Back door.
[13975.08s -> 13975.32s]  I got it.
[13975.32s -> 13975.56s]  I got it.
[13975.56s -> 13975.80s]  I got it.
[13975.80s -> 13976.12s]  I got it.
[13976.12s -> 13976.36s]  I'm good.
[13976.36s -> 13976.84s]  I'm good.
[13976.84s -> 13988.44s]  Something flew out the back.
[13991.16s -> 14003.50s]  Okay.
[14003.50s -> 14004.14s]  Here we are.
[14004.14s -> 14017.31s]  That's coming in fast.
[14017.31s -> 14017.71s]  All right.
[14017.71s -> 14022.70s]  Let's get to the spigot.
[14022.70s -> 14023.50s]  Okay.
[14023.50s -> 14031.00s]  Oh, that's just a crack in the wall.
[14031.00s -> 14031.72s]  Never mind.
[14031.72s -> 14070.01s]  All right.
[14070.01s -> 14070.49s]  Drink.
[14070.49s -> 14080.28s]  Is this death stranding iron?
[14080.44s -> 14107.71s]  I made that joke already.
[14107.71s -> 14108.27s]  Move.
[14108.27s -> 14114.65s]  Close the cap.
[14114.65s -> 14117.21s]  Oh, yeah.
[14118.01s -> 14120.41s]  I probably should close the cap.
[14120.41s -> 14129.74s]  Fill the water tank.
[14129.74s -> 14130.06s]  Yep.
[14130.06s -> 14150.16s]  Come on.
[14150.16s -> 14151.87s]  Fill.
[14151.87s -> 14153.23s]  Fill.
[14153.23s -> 14160.25s]  Fill it.
[14160.25s -> 14160.97s]  Fill it.
[14160.97s -> 14166.76s]  All right.
[14166.76s -> 14170.72s]  Spill.
[14170.72s -> 14171.28s]  Oh, my.
[14171.28s -> 14187.76s]  Good.
[14187.76s -> 14208.84s]  Just fucking fill it.
[14208.84s -> 14209.40s]  We're out.
[14209.40s -> 14214.30s]  This is turning...
[14214.30s -> 14216.62s]  This is a legitimate pee-pee poo-poo stream.
[14216.62s -> 14217.34s]  It is not.
[14217.34s -> 14220.56s]  I'm better than that.
[14220.56s -> 14228.41s]  Come on.
[14228.41s -> 14229.05s]  All right.
[14229.05s -> 14230.32s]  From here.
[14230.32s -> 14232.16s]  Where's the road to keep progressing?
[14232.16s -> 14237.98s]  Is it left or is it right?
[14237.98s -> 14239.39s]  I think it's this way.
[14244.09s -> 14245.29s]  Right here, isn't it?
[14245.29s -> 14249.76s]  Oh, my God.
[14249.76s -> 14250.48s]  Schimpa.
[14250.48s -> 14252.96s]  Schimpa just gave another 20 community subs.
[14252.96s -> 14255.18s]  You are a madman.
[14255.74s -> 14257.10s]  Two, four, six, eight.
[14257.10s -> 14259.26s]  That's 80 community subs from Schimpa.
[14259.82s -> 14261.74s]  Do a monkey noise.
[14265.55s -> 14276.62s]  Look at that shiny hood.
[14277.18s -> 14278.33s]  Good.
[14278.33s -> 14284.51s]  Curious George?
[14285.24s -> 14286.36s]  Curious George didn't talk.
[14286.92s -> 14288.99s]  He didn't make any monkey noises.
[14288.99s -> 14290.03s]  And he just pointed stuff.
[14290.67s -> 14295.36s]  And that guy with a really, really weird fashion sense took care of him.
[14296.00s -> 14301.31s]  The guy that was going to like a Dick Tracy convention every single day.
[14302.28s -> 14302.78s]  Get.
[14303.24s -> 14303.74s]  Oh.
[14304.12s -> 14304.62s]  Oh.
[14304.84s -> 14305.34s]  Oh.
[14305.48s -> 14305.98s]  Oh.
[14306.36s -> 14306.86s]  Oh.
[14307.80s -> 14308.30s]  Oh.
[14310.06s -> 14310.56s]  Oh.
[14314.68s -> 14315.18s]  Okay.
[14315.48s -> 14321.31s]  I turned around though this way, right?
[14322.24s -> 14322.80s]  Is that the road?
[14324.32s -> 14325.04s]  There it is.
[14325.04s -> 14332.75s]  You said you were going to blow up the boat.
[14333.56s -> 14335.16s]  Yeah, plans changed though.
[14335.16s -> 14341.58s]  I can't believe I've been playing this game for four hours.
[14342.14s -> 14344.59s]  That's the biggest shock to me.
[14344.59s -> 14344.91s]  Watch out.
[14344.91s -> 14345.87s]  There's rocks incoming.
[14348.88s -> 14350.72s]  I don't know which way the car's going.
[14350.72s -> 14351.52s]  All right.
[14351.52s -> 14352.72s]  That did slow me down a little.
[14353.28s -> 14364.25s]  It's been four hours.
[14364.25s -> 14367.07s]  Yeah, it has a boat.
[14367.07s -> 14368.27s]  No, I don't need any materials.
[14368.75s -> 14371.63s]  I need to find a new gas station with a new awesome car.
[14372.35s -> 14375.12s]  I've been driving this piece of shit around the whole time.
[14375.92s -> 14383.40s]  Wait, what is this?
[14383.40s -> 14385.66s]  This is a little house.
[14385.66s -> 14386.22s]  Ooh, wait a minute.
[14386.22s -> 14386.94s]  This is a little house.
[14387.66s -> 14394.46s]  Is there a car?
[14394.46s -> 14395.18s]  There's a car here.
[14395.98s -> 14396.48s]  Ooh.
[14397.26s -> 14398.54s]  What do you got in there for an engine?
[14399.26s -> 14402.80s]  Oh, shit.
[14402.80s -> 14403.92s]  What is this place?
[14403.92s -> 14409.31s]  Okay, cool.
[14409.31s -> 14409.87s]  What's this thing?
[14410.43s -> 14417.28s]  Okay, is this good?
[14418.16s -> 14419.68s]  No, that's the same engine that I had before.
[14420.32s -> 14420.82s]  Sucks.
[14421.28s -> 14426.03s]  This car is made of clay.
[14426.03s -> 14434.75s]  Pretty good room back here.
[14434.75s -> 14438.83s]  Is it gas?
[14439.39s -> 14442.35s]  No, is it?
[14442.35s -> 14442.75s]  All right.
[14442.75s -> 14443.47s]  Is there any gas in it?
[14448.40s -> 14450.64s]  It's a much nicer car, though.
[14451.20s -> 14454.40s]  Steal the dash.
[14454.96s -> 14455.44s]  Oh, shit.
[14455.44s -> 14455.84s]  You're right.
[14456.48s -> 14464.08s]  Shitty engine.
[14466.43s -> 14467.93s]  Back in business.
[14467.93s -> 14468.89s]  Look at that.
[14468.89s -> 14469.29s]  Perfect.
[14469.29s -> 14470.65s]  It's a perfect fit.
[14470.65s -> 14480.14s]  Investigate here.
[14480.14s -> 14483.12s]  Can I open these doors?
[14483.12s -> 14493.00s]  It's in an alien language.
[14493.64s -> 14496.24s]  I can't even get in here?
[14496.24s -> 14501.88s]  I can't put this shit in here.
[14501.88s -> 14509.68s]  How do I get in?
[14509.68s -> 14510.80s]  Oh, boy.
[14510.80s -> 14511.36s]  This is...
[14511.36s -> 14512.64s]  This is...
[14512.64s -> 14513.20s]  Oh, yeah.
[14516.43s -> 14517.87s]  A lot of parts in here.
[14519.98s -> 14522.40s]  What do I want to do with these?
[14522.40s -> 14523.52s]  What's this guy?
[14523.52s -> 14525.87s]  What kind of engine is this guy?
[14525.87s -> 14527.63s]  This looks like a pretty cool engine.
[14527.63s -> 14529.10s]  What do you think?
[14529.10s -> 14534.75s]  What's happening?
[14534.75s -> 14535.23s]  Gun.
[14535.23s -> 14535.79s]  Gun.
[14535.79s -> 14536.35s]  Gun.
[14536.35s -> 14536.83s]  Gun.
[14536.83s -> 14537.07s]  Gun.
[14537.07s -> 14537.95s]  What do you mean, gun?
[14537.95s -> 14539.52s]  Is there a gun?
[14539.52s -> 14544.32s]  I already have a gun.
[14544.32s -> 14549.50s]  I already have this.
[14549.50s -> 14555.76s]  I have a gun.
[14555.76s -> 14558.88s]  There's blood in here.
[14558.88s -> 14560.16s]  Why is there blood in here?
[14575.26s -> 14576.22s]  I think I want the blood.
[14576.22s -> 14577.02s]  I'm going to take the...
[14577.02s -> 14579.18s]  Wait, should I dump it out to attract the animals?
[14579.18s -> 14583.77s]  No, fuck this.
[14583.77s -> 14584.33s]  Get this out of here.
[14584.33s -> 14585.85s]  I don't want this thing.
[14585.85s -> 14587.37s]  Disgusting.
[14587.37s -> 14588.81s]  It's a better gun?
[14588.81s -> 14593.69s]  A big tire.
[14593.69s -> 14594.54s]  What's this?
[14595.10s -> 14600.35s]  What's this thing?
[14600.35s -> 14605.15s]  I don't know what any of this stuff does.
[14605.15s -> 14610.91s]  It's a microphone.
[14610.91s -> 14614.76s]  It's a better gun?
[14614.76s -> 14615.96s]  No, it's not a better gun.
[14617.21s -> 14618.25s]  Okay, but what about this engine?
[14622.83s -> 14624.28s]  These engines look...
[14624.28s -> 14625.16s]  I don't know.
[14625.16s -> 14626.52s]  Is one of them better than the other?
[14626.52s -> 14627.64s]  Let's examine them.
[14627.64s -> 14637.29s]  There's a big one over here.
[14640.80s -> 14641.52s]  Another gun.
[14642.08s -> 14648.91s]  The same gun.
[14648.91s -> 14653.45s]  Yeah, it's the same thing.
[14653.45s -> 14654.57s]  Oh, blue paint.
[14654.57s -> 14655.29s]  Yes.
[14655.29s -> 14657.00s]  It was worth coming in here.
[14657.00s -> 14660.65s]  I want to spill this.
[14660.65s -> 14679.98s]  How much paint is in here?
[14679.98s -> 14680.70s]  This is bullshit.
[14687.72s -> 14689.56s]  It's just rusted.
[14691.92s -> 14694.76s]  This car.
[14694.76s -> 14697.40s]  It's got a concrete.
[14697.40s -> 14699.00s]  Why is this car concrete?
[14702.16s -> 14703.44s]  Why am I sleeping?
[14703.44s -> 14709.48s]  It's a shotgun.
[14716.24s -> 14717.44s]  No, it's not.
[14717.44s -> 14720.56s]  Where am I?
[14720.56s -> 14724.38s]  What's going on with my body?
[14729.47s -> 14730.52s]  What's going on?
[14730.52s -> 14739.85s]  Why am I behind myself?
[14739.85s -> 14740.73s]  I do.
[14740.73s -> 14742.33s]  Cue?
[14742.33s -> 14742.89s]  Oh, shit.
[14742.89s -> 14746.83s]  Okay, there we go.
[14746.83s -> 14748.03s]  Uh, let's blow this place up.
[14748.03s -> 14750.62s]  Let's push this car over here.
[14750.62s -> 14751.18s]  Fuck this car.
[14751.74s -> 14754.49s]  Fuck the clay car.
[14754.49s -> 14755.53s]  I got a concrete car.
[14756.25s -> 14765.13s]  I'm gonna get very far away.
[14765.13s -> 14766.01s]  Don't worry.
[14766.01s -> 14777.80s]  Oh, shit.
[14780.64s -> 14781.12s]  Sit.
[14781.12s -> 14782.24s]  No, don't sit in there.
[14782.24s -> 14792.38s]  All right, so this isn't a good spot.
[14792.38s -> 14793.34s]  Take this out.
[14793.34s -> 14794.54s]  There's oil right there too.
[14794.54s -> 14795.82s]  This is gonna be a disaster.
[14795.82s -> 14797.90s]  I need to get very far away.
[14797.90s -> 14800.35s]  There it is.
[14800.35s -> 14801.47s]  Perfect angle.
[14801.47s -> 14806.81s]  Let's get in my car and let's fuck off.
[14807.61s -> 14822.56s]  Save the game.
[14822.56s -> 14823.20s]  Yep.
[14823.20s -> 14825.60s]  Good call.
[14825.60s -> 14827.44s]  Okay, this is probably far.
[14827.44s -> 14828.48s]  Is this far enough away?
[14828.48s -> 14834.54s]  I mean, it's not a nuke.
[14834.54s -> 14852.81s]  It's not a nuclear bomb.
[14852.81s -> 14853.61s]  Nice.
[14853.61s -> 14856.75s]  All right, back on the road.
[14856.75s -> 14877.50s]  Sleep in the car.
[14878.62s -> 14880.51s]  Okay.
[14881.15s -> 14881.87s]  Wrong way.
[14881.87s -> 14883.31s]  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[14883.31s -> 14884.99s]  All right, I'll sleep on the road,
[14884.99s -> 14886.35s]  but I'll make sure the game is saved.
[14887.66s -> 14891.98s]  I'm gonna go like 150 miles per hour and then sleep.
[14902.86s -> 14903.36s]  80.
[14905.66s -> 14906.30s]  Yeah, save it.
[14906.30s -> 14907.66s]  I'm gonna save it right here.
[14907.66s -> 14910.02s]  Is there money on the ground?
[14910.02s -> 14910.74s]  All right, save.
[14912.38s -> 14914.22s]  We're in a perfect spot.
[14914.22s -> 14915.02s]  Back it up.
[14915.02s -> 14915.50s]  Here we go.
[14920.69s -> 14922.05s]  Get this to about 120.
[14922.61s -> 14928.40s]  And then I'm gonna hold V.
[14934.74s -> 14935.86s]  I actually might make it.
[14937.23s -> 14938.43s]  If it's a straight enough straightaway,
[14938.43s -> 14939.07s]  I should be fine.
[14940.78s -> 14941.28s]  We'll see.
[14941.84s -> 14947.27s]  Okay, now is a pretty good time to go to sleep.
[14958.05s -> 14959.41s]  That's efficiency right there.
[14968.39s -> 14969.91s]  Dodge the rock in my sleep.
[14983.17s -> 14985.01s]  It's the DeLorean I time traveled.
[14987.83s -> 14988.47s]  Morty!
[14988.47s -> 14989.19s]  No, it's not Morty.
[14989.19s -> 14989.75s]  It's Marty.
[14990.39s -> 15002.56s]  What's that?
[15002.56s -> 15003.54s]  What was that?
[15003.54s -> 15004.10s]  That was weird.
[15004.90s -> 15007.51s]  That was a weird thing in the road.
[15009.67s -> 15011.19s]  That was a weird thing in the road, wasn't it?
[15011.91s -> 15015.65s]  Nah, who cares?
[15015.65s -> 15016.15s]  Let's go.
[15016.77s -> 15018.63s]  Save it again.
[15018.63s -> 15027.60s]  Sure, not a bad idea.
[15027.60s -> 15028.40s]  Go to the rock.
[15028.96s -> 15032.84s]  How many kilometers have I gone so far, you think?
[15033.48s -> 15036.68s]  I've been on the same tank of gas.
[15036.68s -> 15039.08s]  I have so much gas in the backseat, too.
[15039.08s -> 15040.12s]  There's so much gas.
[15040.92s -> 15052.63s]  I haven't even used a tenth of a liter.
[15060.48s -> 15062.08s]  We only measure in miles.
[15062.72s -> 15065.40s]  Well, that's just what my brain has to do
[15065.40s -> 15067.72s]  because I grew up in the one place on earth.
[15068.44s -> 15068.92s]  They did that.
[15070.08s -> 15071.92s]  Rock in the road, rock in the road, rock in the road.
[15071.92s -> 15091.80s]  Oh, this engine can't even go past 120.
[15091.80s -> 15092.84s]  Come on, we need a better one.
[15094.85s -> 15097.17s]  Somebody said press B and it fucked up everything.
[15099.00s -> 15099.56s]  Ban that person.
[15099.56s -> 15100.76s]  The person that just said press B,
[15100.76s -> 15102.04s]  I want them timed out for 30 seconds.
[15102.68s -> 15119.64s]  It's gonna take 30 seconds to find them.
[15119.64s -> 15121.48s]  All right, we'll just pretend they got timed out.
[15121.48s -> 15126.40s]  I have to investigate this because it could be a truck.
[15126.96s -> 15134.00s]  If there's a bus or anything, it's possible.
[15137.41s -> 15137.65s]  No.
[15138.52s -> 15140.76s]  Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad.
[15141.48s -> 15142.80s]  What is it?
[15142.80s -> 15143.30s]  Sadja?
[15144.00s -> 15145.19s]  It's a J?
[15146.13s -> 15146.63s]  Sage?
[15147.17s -> 15147.73s]  How do you say it?
[15162.13s -> 15164.05s]  This is an interesting little spot right here.
[15164.05s -> 15164.61s]  Anything here?
[15166.28s -> 15167.40s]  Rolling up like this.
[15167.40s -> 15168.28s]  All right, what do you got?
[15170.68s -> 15171.18s]  Bumpa?
[15172.60s -> 15177.88s]  What do you got?
[15177.88s -> 15179.30s]  What's in there?
[15179.30s -> 15180.10s]  Gas?
[15180.10s -> 15181.06s]  Just use it.
[15181.06s -> 15191.52s]  Blood, put blood in the tank.
[15197.40s -> 15197.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[15198.61s -> 15199.43s]  Yep.
[15199.43s -> 15200.39s]  Thank God.
[15200.39s -> 15206.80s]  I can actually wash the car now.
[15206.80s -> 15207.36s]  What gold?
[15207.36s -> 15208.00s]  I don't even want it.
[15208.00s -> 15209.20s]  This is stupid.
[15209.20s -> 15210.40s]  Here's the thing I was talking about.
[15213.46s -> 15214.50s]  What is this?
[15214.50s -> 15220.39s]  There's a secret engine in here.
[15220.39s -> 15221.27s]  How do I get it?
[15221.27s -> 15225.12s]  There's an engine in there.
[15225.12s -> 15261.27s]  I'll get out.
[15261.27s -> 15265.49s]  Check this shit out.
[15265.49s -> 15279.38s]  Was it the last save?
[15279.38s -> 15281.27s]  I don't know.
[15281.27s -> 15282.39s]  I don't remember what it is.
[15282.39s -> 15283.19s]  This one here?
[15283.19s -> 15284.98s]  No, it was after.
[15284.98s -> 15285.62s]  Where is it?
[15285.62s -> 15287.78s]  Oh, it's right here.
[15287.78s -> 15288.66s]  Look at the auto save.
[15288.66s -> 15304.40s]  God damn it, I had it.
[15304.40s -> 15312.21s]  I think you can fucking trap me in there.
[15312.21s -> 15312.69s]  Don't think so.
[15312.69s -> 15313.19s]  Give me that.
[15326.93s -> 15328.45s]  Polishing concrete.
[15328.45s -> 15329.81s]  Looks pretty good.
[15329.81s -> 15330.77s]  Do you know what you think?
[15330.77s -> 15373.06s]  Better than ever, I think.
[15373.06s -> 15374.34s]  Wash the concrete away.
[15374.34s -> 15375.38s]  That's not how that works.
[15375.38s -> 15393.78s]  Too bright.
[15393.78s -> 15394.58s]  It was working?
[15395.14s -> 15396.32s]  It was working.
[15399.84s -> 15401.44s]  I can't go back for a sponge.
[15401.44s -> 15403.04s]  I've yaded it into the sun.
[15403.76s -> 15406.56s]  There'll be more sponges.
[15407.20s -> 15420.08s]  No, there won't be.
[15420.08s -> 15421.28s]  Yes, there will.
[15421.28s -> 15422.48s]  That's like sponge number 10
[15422.48s -> 15423.52s]  we've found in the game so far.
[15423.52s -> 15424.16s]  We're going to be fine.
[15424.72s -> 15435.54s]  I'm going to lose control if I don't stop.
[15436.10s -> 15439.54s]  No telephone pole.
[15439.54s -> 15440.10s]  No telephone pole.
[15440.10s -> 15440.66s]  No telephone pole.
[15440.66s -> 15441.06s]  We're fine.
[15444.08s -> 15444.58s]  No!
[15445.44s -> 15450.68s]  Back on the road.
[15450.68s -> 15456.42s]  Every sponge is personalized.
[15461.01s -> 15462.77s]  Oh, pretty good tuber voice.
[15462.77s -> 15469.24s]  I had to do it.
[15474.98s -> 15476.18s]  Not that there's a lot of people here.
[15476.98s -> 15478.58s]  I do want to make sure I let you know.
[15479.30s -> 15480.04s]  Tomorrow.
[15480.68s -> 15481.96s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[15482.60s -> 15484.56s]  I'll be on Kitboga's stream.
[15485.36s -> 15487.19s]  Popping in from time to time as a guest
[15487.19s -> 15488.63s]  when he finds a good call.
[15489.35s -> 15493.68s]  I already said press B.
[15493.68s -> 15494.16s]  I just did.
[15494.88s -> 15496.00s]  I'm going to host it.
[15496.56s -> 15498.00s]  The stream will just be hosted the whole time.
[15498.80s -> 15500.50s]  Maybe I'll pop in a little bit.
[15500.50s -> 15502.26s]  Maybe we'll get a fun call going.
[15502.98s -> 15505.62s]  That's the plan.
[15505.62s -> 15507.54s]  I won't be live tomorrow on this channel.
[15512.45s -> 15513.89s]  I have to have gone pretty far, right?
[15514.45s -> 15520.85s]  What time is that stream at?
[15522.05s -> 15522.93s]  That's a really good question
[15522.93s -> 15524.85s]  because I know Kit starts streaming
[15526.42s -> 15529.30s]  around 10, 9, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[15530.34s -> 15532.42s]  Somewhere around maybe noon Eastern.
[15532.42s -> 15533.46s]  That's where he typically starts.
[15535.59s -> 15538.31s]  I'm going to assume somewhere around
[15539.27s -> 15544.48s]  10 to 12 Pacific is when I'll be on.
[15545.12s -> 15545.44s]  Maybe.
[15546.24s -> 15549.78s]  Maybe a little later.
[15549.78s -> 15551.22s]  Maybe a little earlier depending on
[15551.22s -> 15552.82s]  if he gets a call that he likes.
[15552.82s -> 15553.30s]  That's good.
[15553.94s -> 15563.36s]  This has been pretty clean so far at 130 plus.
[15564.00s -> 15565.84s]  140 now.
[15566.40s -> 15567.89s]  This is it.
[15567.89s -> 15568.29s]  It's over.
[15568.29s -> 15568.61s]  It's over.
[15568.61s -> 15568.93s]  It's over.
[15568.93s -> 15569.25s]  No, it's not.
[15569.25s -> 15570.77s]  Just calm down and go through the gap.
[15570.77s -> 15571.25s]  Okay, we're good.
[15571.89s -> 15575.83s]  Just let the car ride a little.
[15575.83s -> 15576.55s]  Let the car ride.
[15576.55s -> 15578.23s]  Break, break, break, break, break, break.
[15578.23s -> 15578.95s]  You're good.
[15578.95s -> 15580.07s]  Watch out for that tiny rock.
[15580.87s -> 15583.64s]  What happened?
[15583.64s -> 15585.08s]  Why did the oil come out?
[15585.97s -> 15586.53s]  I need that.
[15588.37s -> 15588.85s]  What happened?
[15588.85s -> 15589.73s]  Let's assess the damage.
[15589.73s -> 15590.53s]  Hold on.
[15590.53s -> 15596.23s]  How did I get out of there?
[15596.23s -> 15607.89s]  It slipped through the tire.
[15607.89s -> 15609.17s]  Did I lose a tire?
[15609.17s -> 15610.56s]  Hold on.
[15610.56s -> 15611.36s]  I lost a tire.
[15611.92s -> 15616.00s]  I think I did.
[15616.64s -> 15628.74s]  No, I didn't lose it.
[15628.74s -> 15629.78s]  Why is there a tire out here?
[15630.50s -> 15637.14s]  Oh, that's the spare.
[15637.14s -> 15638.02s]  Why does it look like shit?
[15638.50s -> 15640.00s]  All right, we need to.
[15640.00s -> 15641.04s]  I got to recalibrate this.
[15641.04s -> 15641.84s]  Hold on.
[15641.84s -> 15644.90s]  Right over a fucking stone.
[15645.70s -> 15647.06s]  All right, get in there.
[15649.19s -> 15650.23s]  Long ways, please.
[15650.87s -> 15651.51s]  Long ways.
[15658.69s -> 15658.93s]  Why?
[15658.93s -> 15659.89s]  Won't fit anymore?
[15661.78s -> 15662.58s]  Thank you.
[15662.58s -> 15669.96s]  You don't need the barrel?
[15669.96s -> 15671.40s]  I have to take the barrel.
[15671.40s -> 15673.20s]  The only way I feel comfortable.
[15674.26s -> 15674.98s]  Fuck the spare.
[15674.98s -> 15675.30s]  Just get it.
[15675.30s -> 15676.18s]  I don't even care.
[15676.18s -> 15676.98s]  I don't care.
[15676.98s -> 15680.63s]  Get me the fuck out of here.
[15690.84s -> 15691.80s]  Safety barrel.
[15692.36s -> 15702.88s]  My, like, gamer growth hurts so much.
[15703.52s -> 15715.48s]  Oh, there's a bunch of people that might not have been here.
[15719.08s -> 15719.80s]  You had to be there.
[15719.80s -> 15720.60s]  That's all I can say.
[15720.60s -> 15722.04s]  And really, that's really all I'm going to say.
[15722.84s -> 15727.62s]  Oh, shit.
[15727.62s -> 15728.58s]  I'm going 140.
[15729.22s -> 15731.08s]  Oh, my God.
[15731.08s -> 15732.20s]  I'm going 140.
[15732.20s -> 15732.92s]  Oh, my God.
[15732.92s -> 15733.72s]  Oh, my God.
[15733.72s -> 15734.60s]  Oh, my God.
[15734.60s -> 15735.16s]  Oh, my God.
[15735.16s -> 15735.64s]  It's okay.
[15737.88s -> 15738.84s]  But don't touch anything.
[15741.12s -> 15742.08s]  I just missed it.
[15743.70s -> 15744.82s]  I just missed it.
[15744.82s -> 15745.38s]  Break.
[15745.38s -> 15745.86s]  Let's go.
[15753.94s -> 15754.42s]  But no.
[15754.98s -> 15756.18s]  Here's the surprising thing.
[15756.18s -> 15758.58s]  No new gas station.
[15759.14s -> 15761.99s]  You guys remember when I actually thought
[15761.99s -> 15763.59s]  that I was going to be able to fucking walk?
[15765.08s -> 15767.40s]  Thank God I actually restarted.
[15767.40s -> 15769.32s]  I would still be walking to that gas station.
[15775.75s -> 15778.63s]  And there would be, like, 1,100 people still here.
[15781.57s -> 15782.13s]  Thank God.
[15782.69s -> 15795.88s]  Why did that happen?
[15804.16s -> 15805.20s]  It just clipped.
[15805.20s -> 15806.08s]  I just clipped it.
[15806.72s -> 15810.79s]  It just got clipped a little.
[15811.51s -> 15812.39s]  I lost something.
[15813.03s -> 15814.63s]  What did I lose?
[15815.43s -> 15819.20s]  Something fell off.
[15819.84s -> 15822.58s]  I didn't lose anything.
[15823.22s -> 15824.60s]  Everything looks...
[15824.60s -> 15825.08s]  Wait.
[15825.08s -> 15826.20s]  Everything seems to be in order.
[15826.76s -> 15834.61s]  No, I didn't lose anything.
[15834.61s -> 15838.87s]  I took out my gold bar.
[15838.87s -> 15847.25s]  I lost a hubcap.
[15847.25s -> 15847.81s]  That's okay.
[15848.53s -> 15850.37s]  All right.
[15850.37s -> 15852.05s]  Slow down because the sun is unbearable.
[15857.68s -> 15860.42s]  Stop driving.
[15860.42s -> 15861.46s]  You're losing gas.
[15863.72s -> 15865.24s]  Yes, I am.
[15865.88s -> 15869.43s]  That's a big building coming up.
[15869.43s -> 15869.91s]  Finally.
[15870.71s -> 15873.36s]  Slow down.
[15873.36s -> 15874.32s]  I can't see shit.
[15874.88s -> 15878.31s]  I'd rather hit something going 30 than hit something going 80.
[15878.95s -> 15882.15s]  Just the thing you pull down.
[15882.15s -> 15882.71s]  Oh, right.
[15882.71s -> 15883.59s]  I threw it out the window.
[15885.25s -> 15886.21s]  That's a big building.
[15897.11s -> 15899.27s]  I'm doing the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey thing.
[15909.46s -> 15910.34s]  Loud as hell.
[15910.98s -> 15915.24s]  Look at that big house.
[15915.88s -> 15943.57s]  Am I okay?
[15944.13s -> 15950.00s]  I'm fine.
[15950.00s -> 15952.34s]  The car is fine.
[15952.34s -> 15952.74s]  Cool.
[15952.74s -> 15953.14s]  All right.
[15953.14s -> 15953.46s]  Nice.
[15953.46s -> 15963.33s]  Look at this big ass house.
[15963.33s -> 15963.89s]  Yes.
[15963.89s -> 15964.53s]  A bike.
[15964.53s -> 15967.49s]  I don't know how to work it.
[15967.49s -> 15970.80s]  Fuel tank.
[15970.80s -> 15971.60s]  Empty.
[15971.60s -> 15972.16s]  Gas.
[15972.16s -> 15973.80s]  All right.
[15973.80s -> 15974.76s]  Pick this shit up.
[15974.84s -> 15975.96s]  I want to get this to work.
[15975.96s -> 15977.80s]  I'm going to ride a goddamn bike.
[15977.80s -> 15986.26s]  No, please don't.
[15986.26s -> 15986.98s]  What do you mean?
[15986.98s -> 15988.79s]  No wheels.
[15988.79s -> 15989.11s]  No.
[15989.11s -> 15989.83s]  I can get wheels.
[15989.83s -> 15991.03s]  I have plenty of wheels.
[15991.03s -> 16005.59s]  Why can I not fill this?
[16005.59s -> 16007.35s]  How much gas does it need?
[16007.35s -> 16008.39s]  What's the combo?
[16008.39s -> 16020.52s]  Get gun.
[16020.52s -> 16021.00s]  Get new.
[16021.72s -> 16022.68s]  That's a new gun.
[16022.68s -> 16024.02s]  Not a new gun.
[16024.02s -> 16048.58s]  Sink.
[16048.58s -> 16053.14s]  What actually is this?
[16053.14s -> 16057.06s]  It's a trailer.
[16058.48s -> 16061.00s]  Holy shit.
[16061.00s -> 16061.80s]  It's a trailer.
[16061.80s -> 16064.08s]  Can I use it?
[16064.08s -> 16068.44s]  I hope I can actually attach this thing.
[16068.44s -> 16070.08s]  Put the bed in here.
[16070.08s -> 16072.90s]  Oh my god.
[16072.90s -> 16073.46s]  Yeah.
[16073.46s -> 16075.62s]  There are no wheels on it, but it's okay.
[16075.62s -> 16076.90s]  I think I can still probably attach it.
[16081.56s -> 16091.46s]  Stay right there.
[16091.46s -> 16092.10s]  It is that.
[16092.10s -> 16093.46s]  And then here, right?
[16093.46s -> 16099.06s]  I can't pick it up.
[16099.06s -> 16100.87s]  I can just push it.
[16100.87s -> 16101.67s]  Other way.
[16101.67s -> 16108.23s]  Other way.
[16108.23s -> 16108.55s]  Damn it.
[16108.55s -> 16110.07s]  I thought that was going to be awesome.
[16110.07s -> 16127.78s]  We're going to attach?
[16127.78s -> 16128.82s]  Make a train.
[16128.82s -> 16132.12s]  I don't think I can attach this.
[16132.12s -> 16135.70s]  Press F to hold it.
[16135.70s -> 16141.44s]  Well, F. Grab the end of it.
[16141.44s -> 16143.44s]  Oh, yeah.
[16143.44s -> 16143.76s]  Yes.
[16144.32s -> 16145.22s]  Yes.
[16145.22s -> 16145.54s]  Yes.
[16146.18s -> 16146.50s]  Yes.
[16147.14s -> 16147.46s]  Yes.
[16148.52s -> 16148.84s]  Yes.
[16150.60s -> 16151.32s]  Yes.
[16151.32s -> 16152.60s]  And I can bring this.
[16152.60s -> 16153.40s]  I can bring the bike.
[16153.40s -> 16154.44s]  I can actually carry it.
[16154.44s -> 16156.60s]  What's happening?
[16156.60s -> 16157.16s]  Stop.
[16157.16s -> 16165.76s]  I'm going to bring this bike wherever I want.
[16166.16s -> 16171.46s]  I'm going to find wheels for it.
[16171.46s -> 16172.10s]  Excellent.
[16172.10s -> 16173.51s]  And the bed?
[16173.51s -> 16177.75s]  I don't think the bed's not going to fit on there.
[16177.75s -> 16180.44s]  This thing is too big.
[16180.44s -> 16185.24s]  What's wrong with me?
[16185.24s -> 16190.02s]  Why am I hearing bells?
[16190.02s -> 16195.01s]  I died?
[16195.01s -> 16203.30s]  What does it say?
[16203.30s -> 16208.53s]  Here?
[16208.53s -> 16210.85s]  Bed killed me.
[16210.85s -> 16211.41s]  Wait, did I?
[16211.41s -> 16211.65s]  Okay.
[16221.67s -> 16222.39s]  Shit.
[16222.39s -> 16228.58s]  All right.
[16228.58s -> 16229.22s]  Bike.
[16229.22s -> 16233.54s]  So are you sure I didn't die from dehydration?
[16233.54s -> 16238.66s]  That's not what happened, right?
[16238.66s -> 16244.21s]  Cap the thing.
[16244.21s -> 16248.34s]  Cap the thing.
[16248.34s -> 16249.70s]  Well, I can't bring the bed then.
[16249.70s -> 16255.22s]  I'm sorry.
[16255.22s -> 16255.78s]  I can't.
[16255.78s -> 16257.80s]  I want to, but I can't.
[16257.80s -> 16261.24s]  Go upstairs.
[16261.24s -> 16262.92s]  I know I'm not done exploring.
[16262.92s -> 16267.88s]  How do I get upstairs, though?
[16267.88s -> 16268.68s]  Is there a ladder?
[16268.68s -> 16274.60s]  Can I climb that?
[16274.60s -> 16281.60s]  Big money?
[16281.60s -> 16283.36s]  Oh, there was a lot of big money.
[16283.36s -> 16285.22s]  Yeah, let's take another pee break.
[16285.22s -> 16286.58s]  And I'm going to, when I come back, I'm going to do,
[16286.58s -> 16287.62s]  I'm going to go over some of these bits.
[16287.62s -> 16289.30s]  There's been like a bunch of huge ones.
[16289.30s -> 16290.72s]  I'll be right back.
[16290.72s -> 16449.36s]  Holy shit, guys.
[16449.36s -> 16453.44s]  I just realized I haven't brushed my teeth in like eight or nine days.
[16453.44s -> 16454.32s]  They're green.
[16454.32s -> 16457.19s]  Should I just take a minute to brush them or whatever?
[16457.19s -> 16465.80s]  I don't know why I thought that was like, well, that's like a funny thing I'll say.
[16465.80s -> 16466.52s]  Like, that's not even funny.
[16466.52s -> 16467.80s]  This is gross and strange.
[16467.80s -> 16469.00s]  You're just a weird guy.
[16469.00s -> 16470.20s]  It's disgusting everybody.
[16470.20s -> 16472.12s]  That's not like, oh, funny, huh?
[16472.12s -> 16473.16s]  No, it's just gross.
[16475.99s -> 16480.88s]  All right, we're back to the long road.
[16480.88s -> 16485.11s]  What was I trying to do?
[16485.11s -> 16485.59s]  Get on the roof?
[16486.23s -> 16494.16s]  I don't think I can.
[16494.88s -> 16497.75s]  Can't climb pipes.
[16500.32s -> 16503.60s]  I brushed him like, I brushed him right before the stream turned on,
[16503.60s -> 16504.48s]  like five hours ago.
[16504.48s -> 16504.88s]  I'm fine.
[16504.88s -> 16505.28s]  I'm kidding.
[16505.28s -> 16505.84s]  It was a joke.
[16506.48s -> 16525.51s]  Oh, I need this right in the back.
[16525.51s -> 16526.55s]  Kind of violent, but whatever.
[16529.11s -> 16529.99s]  I got plenty of gas.
[16529.99s -> 16530.63s]  I got my bike.
[16530.63s -> 16534.23s]  I have my trailer, but I don't, I can't, I don't think I can get up there.
[16534.87s -> 16536.79s]  Throw your teeth.
[16536.79s -> 16539.19s]  No, that's too, that's way too intimate.
[16539.59s -> 16541.57s]  Don't jump in there, stupid.
[16542.37s -> 16545.00s]  That's too like, I mean, personal.
[16545.72s -> 16547.62s]  Oh, the bits, right, right, right, yeah, yeah, sorry.
[16548.95s -> 16550.63s]  Attack of the Hank gave five community subs.
[16550.63s -> 16551.03s]  Thanks.
[16551.03s -> 16553.59s]  Board of Bones gave $50.
[16553.59s -> 16556.02s]  5,000 bits from Board of Bones.
[16556.02s -> 16558.18s]  I've been watching your videos for about seven years.
[16558.18s -> 16560.66s]  I want to give a huge thanks to all the entertainment throughout the years.
[16560.66s -> 16562.07s]  You're the best.
[16562.07s -> 16563.70s]  That's a long time.
[16563.70s -> 16566.36s]  Hope you stick around for season eight.
[16567.56s -> 16569.40s]  That's the season that everybody says to skip.
[16569.40s -> 16572.60s]  And then we had Lorag for $50.
[16572.60s -> 16573.64s]  Hey man, long time no see.
[16573.64s -> 16575.64s]  You've left a couple dozen voice bails.
[16575.72s -> 16577.73s]  But I guess they haven't been getting to you for some reason.
[16577.73s -> 16578.53s]  Ha ha.
[16578.53s -> 16580.37s]  Anyways, I just wanted to check up on you and chat.
[16580.37s -> 16582.95s]  Hope you're all doing as well as you can.
[16582.95s -> 16584.47s]  Except for Keith, he sucks.
[16584.47s -> 16585.43s]  Sorry, Keith.
[16585.43s -> 16588.52s]  Thank you, Lorag, for the 5,000 bits.
[16588.52s -> 16590.04s]  Potion Dweller, 5,000 bits.
[16590.04s -> 16591.00s]  Belated happy birthday.
[16591.00s -> 16593.17s]  Just celebrated my yesterday.
[16593.17s -> 16597.00s]  Question, have you considered doing any D&D streams with Stir and Arcadium?
[16597.00s -> 16598.60s]  I think you'd be magnificent on them.
[16598.60s -> 16600.95s]  I know your schedule tends to be a little crazy,
[16600.95s -> 16603.19s]  but you should give it a go if you can work the time up.
[16603.19s -> 16605.35s]  Well, I have something to tell you.
[16605.43s -> 16612.53s]  Star is working on a custom sorcery-style D&D-like campaign
[16612.53s -> 16615.99s]  that I'm going to be playing on stream.
[16615.99s -> 16617.83s]  He's in the middle of doing it right now.
[16617.83s -> 16622.53s]  It's going to be a choose-your-own-adventure game board.
[16622.53s -> 16626.05s]  Custom made.
[16626.05s -> 16626.93s]  I'm really looking forward to it.
[16626.93s -> 16627.65s]  It should be good.
[16627.65s -> 16630.20s]  I don't have a timetable on when it's going to be done
[16630.20s -> 16633.54s]  because he's just going to do it.
[16633.54s -> 16636.37s]  There's no like, oh, that'll be next week.
[16636.37s -> 16638.53s]  But maybe by the end of the year, early next year,
[16638.53s -> 16641.73s]  whenever he gets around to making it and doing it,
[16641.73s -> 16643.68s]  there's no rush on it.
[16643.68s -> 16645.76s]  So whenever it's ready, it should be a lot of fun.
[16645.76s -> 16649.49s]  Thanks a lot, guys, though.
[16649.49s -> 16654.52s]  Let's keep going.
[16654.52s -> 16655.40s]  Show those teeth.
[16655.40s -> 16656.60s]  No, I don't want to show you my teeth.
[16657.24s -> 16661.97s]  There's only two people in the world that are going to see my teeth.
[16664.13s -> 16668.76s]  The dentist and me.
[16668.76s -> 16671.16s]  And I hate the dentist.
[16671.16s -> 16672.92s]  Not because I don't like going to the dentist.
[16672.92s -> 16674.23s]  I don't care.
[16674.23s -> 16678.07s]  I don't like when they open your mouth really wide
[16678.07s -> 16679.75s]  and they take a look at every single inch
[16679.75s -> 16681.89s]  and they can see everything.
[16681.89s -> 16683.33s]  You can't hide shit from the dentist.
[16685.03s -> 16686.23s]  And you think that you're so clever
[16686.23s -> 16689.99s]  by brushing your teeth and flossing 20 minutes before you go.
[16689.99s -> 16691.59s]  Look, aren't they clean?
[16691.59s -> 16692.31s]  No, they're not.
[16692.31s -> 16692.63s]  They're not.
[16692.63s -> 16693.27s]  Not at all.
[16693.27s -> 16694.15s]  That doesn't do anything.
[16694.15s -> 16696.85s]  You think it does, but it doesn't.
[16696.85s -> 16699.57s]  I haven't flossed in four and a half months.
[16699.57s -> 16700.93s]  But look, I flossed.
[16700.93s -> 16702.45s]  No, there's this buildup back there.
[16702.45s -> 16703.41s]  They know what you're doing.
[16703.41s -> 16704.21s]  You're an asshole.
[16704.77s -> 16707.25s]  All right, how do I get up?
[16707.25s -> 16712.64s]  I don't think I can't get up on the roof.
[16712.64s -> 16713.52s]  I can't.
[16713.52s -> 16717.64s]  Why are you such a tool?
[16719.99s -> 16720.55s]  What?
[16720.55s -> 16722.92s]  What do you mean?
[16725.97s -> 16727.41s]  That kind of made me feel bad.
[16727.97s -> 16730.55s]  I'm sorry, dude.
[16730.55s -> 16735.48s]  Anyways.
[16740.40s -> 16741.52s]  Yeah, that kind of just like, I don't know.
[16741.52s -> 16744.36s]  That like really, they really just like threw me off.
[16744.36s -> 16744.60s]  Yeah.
[16744.60s -> 16744.92s]  All right.
[16744.92s -> 16746.04s]  Well, I'll see you guys later.
[16746.04s -> 16746.60s]  That's, I don't know.
[16746.60s -> 16747.32s]  It's like fucking with me.
[16747.32s -> 16747.88s]  You know what I mean?
[16751.36s -> 16751.84s]  Whatever.
[16752.40s -> 16764.60s]  All right.
[16764.60s -> 16765.96s]  This is still connected, right?
[16765.96s -> 16769.14s]  You need tires for the bike.
[16769.14s -> 16770.42s]  Yeah, but there's none in there.
[16770.42s -> 16772.52s]  I take it back.
[16773.33s -> 16773.57s]  See?
[16777.38s -> 16777.62s]  See?
[16778.18s -> 16784.85s]  Oh, Raid from Tomato.
[16784.85s -> 16785.57s]  What's up, Tomato?
[16786.21s -> 16787.09s]  What's going on, everybody?
[16787.09s -> 16787.41s]  Welcome.
[16788.05s -> 16790.05s]  Thanks for the Raid, Tomato.
[16790.05s -> 16793.64s]  Hope you had a good stream, whatever you were just doing.
[16793.72s -> 16794.68s]  Welcome, Raiders.
[16795.40s -> 16802.40s]  You're witnessing a game called The Long Drive.
[16802.96s -> 16804.24s]  You may or may not have seen it before.
[16804.80s -> 16809.52s]  I am currently about 20 minutes away from the world record.
[16809.52s -> 16812.64s]  So really trying to get that world record.
[16812.64s -> 16819.91s]  Did the bike fall off?
[16819.91s -> 16820.87s]  No, stop lying to me.
[16820.87s -> 16821.35s]  What are you doing?
[16827.35s -> 16828.55s]  No, but thanks a lot, Tomato.
[16828.55s -> 16829.27s]  Hope you're doing well.
[16829.27s -> 16830.31s]  Thanks for the Raid.
[16830.31s -> 16834.77s]  Let's continue our, if you don't know Tomato, go follow him right now.
[16834.77s -> 16835.41s]  What are you, crazy?
[16835.97s -> 16844.66s]  Water tower or the pyramid?
[16844.66s -> 16849.57s]  Keep your eyes on the road.
[16849.57s -> 16851.33s]  Sing the welcome Raider song.
[16851.33s -> 16858.28s]  No, because even the welcome Raider song joke song will make them all leave.
[16858.28s -> 16859.00s]  I know it will.
[16859.00s -> 16859.48s]  Trust me.
[16861.84s -> 16862.72s]  Pay attention.
[16862.72s -> 16864.56s]  Don't, okay, I'm going too fast.
[16864.56s -> 16866.40s]  I got, I got, I got a carriage now.
[16866.40s -> 16867.44s]  I got a carriage.
[16867.44s -> 16871.22s]  I need two tires and I need a battery.
[16871.22s -> 16872.98s]  Were you guys lying about the battery or what?
[16873.54s -> 16878.39s]  Actually, it is kind of like a pyramid.
[16878.39s -> 16882.76s]  Can I go in there?
[16882.76s -> 16884.84s]  You need four tires on the bike?
[16884.84s -> 16888.00s]  No, you don't.
[16888.00s -> 16888.96s]  It's a bike.
[16888.96s -> 16892.05s]  The reason why it's called a bicycle is because it has two wheels.
[16892.85s -> 16894.05s]  And it's a sickle.
[16894.05s -> 16895.86s]  Where I have something.
[16895.86s -> 16896.58s]  I don't know.
[16896.58s -> 16906.45s]  Cycle.
[16906.45s -> 16908.13s]  Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a two cycle.
[16908.13s -> 16910.84s]  It means it's two wheels on the bike.
[16910.84s -> 16919.36s]  What's that noise?
[16922.24s -> 16923.12s]  What does that sound?
[16927.06s -> 16927.86s]  Stop.
[16927.86s -> 16930.92s]  What's the problem?
[16930.92s -> 16932.20s]  Oh, this doesn't have wheels.
[16932.20s -> 16932.76s]  Right.
[16932.76s -> 16934.28s]  This doesn't have wheels.
[16934.28s -> 16943.00s]  Is it smoking?
[16949.41s -> 16950.37s]  No, it's fine.
[16951.33s -> 16952.69s]  It's smoking, but whatever.
[16953.41s -> 16954.85s]  Get your hand off.
[16954.85s -> 16955.25s]  What are you doing?
[16955.25s -> 16955.97s]  Get your hands off that.
[16955.97s -> 16957.09s]  Get your hand off that.
[16957.09s -> 16958.05s]  Why is he still holding it?
[16958.85s -> 16960.61s]  Why is he still holding that and shaking it around?
[16960.61s -> 16961.09s]  What's he doing?
[16961.81s -> 16966.84s]  Stop that.
[16967.48s -> 16969.32s]  Uh, who's the guy in this?
[16969.32s -> 16972.60s]  This isn't even the backseat holding a gun up to my body.
[16973.48s -> 16973.98s]  Drive.
[16974.76s -> 16975.48s]  I'm going, man.
[16975.48s -> 16975.96s]  I'm going.
[16975.96s -> 16976.52s]  That's right.
[16976.52s -> 16978.04s]  Keep going until you get to the bank.
[16983.57s -> 16984.69s]  I'm doing that.
[16984.69s -> 16985.73s]  It's okay.
[16985.73s -> 16988.29s]  The screeching is me doing that.
[16990.29s -> 16993.25s]  I can't go more than 40 miles per hour because the game's making me do this.
[16996.45s -> 16997.49s]  I can't even hit the brake.
[16998.13s -> 17011.12s]  Why won't he take his hand off the clutch?
[17011.84s -> 17016.61s]  Take your hand off.
[17016.61s -> 17017.73s]  Take your hand off.
[17019.51s -> 17021.43s]  Oh, I'm sitting in the other seat.
[17021.43s -> 17027.54s]  Okay, we're good.
[17030.20s -> 17031.48s]  Okay, there we go.
[17031.48s -> 17037.51s]  He's still doing it.
[17041.22s -> 17042.74s]  I need wheels for the bike.
[17044.76s -> 17045.32s]  There we go.
[17047.14s -> 17048.50s]  Get your hand off.
[17048.50s -> 17049.86s]  Stop touching the clutch.
[17050.90s -> 17052.34s]  Stop touching the transmission thing.
[17055.12s -> 17056.56s]  Rip the clutch out and throw it out the window.
[17056.56s -> 17057.20s]  I don't think you can.
[17057.92s -> 17064.64s]  What is this bit?
[17065.20s -> 17067.20s]  Uh, it's me driving the car.
[17067.20s -> 17068.16s]  It's the whole game, man.
[17068.72s -> 17076.32s]  That's not a clutch.
[17076.32s -> 17076.96s]  You know what I mean?
[17076.96s -> 17079.36s]  The stick that you move to drive the car.
[17080.00s -> 17081.43s]  You put it in drive.
[17081.43s -> 17082.15s]  You put it in reverse.
[17082.71s -> 17083.38s]  Uh-oh.
[17087.16s -> 17088.04s]  Gear stick.
[17088.04s -> 17090.37s]  Yeah, you get it.
[17090.37s -> 17093.12s]  All right, what do you guys want for food?
[17093.68s -> 17094.64s]  And by what do you want food?
[17094.64s -> 17098.56s]  I mean, what should I get for food in like a minute when the stream ends?
[17101.19s -> 17102.07s]  No, no McDonald's.
[17102.07s -> 17102.79s]  I'm over that for now.
[17109.06s -> 17110.58s]  Um, something's going on in the back.
[17111.52s -> 17112.32s]  Is the bike still there?
[17112.88s -> 17121.81s]  It's still there.
[17128.72s -> 17129.60s]  Mayonnaise sandwich.
[17129.60s -> 17130.00s]  No, thanks.
[17130.00s -> 17130.80s]  That doesn't sound good.
[17132.60s -> 17133.24s]  Italian food.
[17133.24s -> 17133.96s]  Mmm.
[17133.96s -> 17134.92s]  What kind of, what kind?
[17135.48s -> 17136.95s]  I mean, like pasta?
[17136.95s -> 17138.23s]  You mean like meatballs?
[17138.23s -> 17139.78s]  What do you mean?
[17139.78s -> 17140.26s]  Pizza?
[17140.26s -> 17142.50s]  Eh, I'm not into pizza right now.
[17142.50s -> 17143.00s]  Something else.
[17145.35s -> 17145.99s]  Korean food.
[17145.99s -> 17146.39s]  Mmm.
[17146.39s -> 17148.47s]  That's actually pretty, that sounds good.
[17149.27s -> 17150.23s]  Waffle house, maybe.
[17151.03s -> 17164.84s]  I'll have to think about it.
[17164.84s -> 17169.20s]  I'll get back to you later.
[17176.31s -> 17177.43s]  Kiss me on the mouth.
[17177.43s -> 17178.15s]  That's not food.
[17179.43s -> 17179.83s]  But no.
[17180.39s -> 17185.65s]  This thing is so hard to control because of the shit behind me.
[17187.83s -> 17189.17s]  Okay.
[17189.17s -> 17191.64s]  Just got a super speed boost somehow.
[17192.20s -> 17193.16s]  I just did the sonic.
[17193.16s -> 17194.76s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[17194.76s -> 17196.18s]  And then went forward.
[17198.48s -> 17198.96s]  Interesting.
[17198.96s -> 17199.76s]  Now I'm over 100.
[17200.48s -> 17205.27s]  Is that thing still there?
[17209.25s -> 17212.53s]  Uh, okay.
[17212.53s -> 17215.89s]  It's the, it's the little, it's the pole trailer behind me that's doing it.
[17215.89s -> 17217.01s]  Going right for that pole.
[17217.97s -> 17218.47s]  Aye.
[17218.93s -> 17221.33s]  Oh, it's just bouncing around everywhere, ain't it?
[17222.05s -> 17226.87s]  We're fine.
[17227.51s -> 17232.50s]  Get rid of it, please.
[17232.50s -> 17233.22s]  I'm still fine.
[17233.86s -> 17239.72s]  Stop getting out.
[17239.72s -> 17241.48s]  Well, I'm freaking out because I don't know if it's still there.
[17244.16s -> 17245.28s]  I will put wheels on it.
[17245.28s -> 17246.08s]  I will.
[17246.08s -> 17248.53s]  Press B to check the bike.
[17249.33s -> 17260.96s]  No, just making sure there's no shit on the seat.
[17261.60s -> 17267.86s]  Wait, can I drive from the other seat?
[17268.50s -> 17271.59s]  Can I grab the wheel from the passenger seat?
[17281.99s -> 17282.71s]  Nope.
[17282.71s -> 17289.64s]  Go inside the pyramid.
[17293.28s -> 17298.13s]  I'm kind of, I really want to ride the motorcycle so bad.
[17299.49s -> 17302.21s]  At full speed and not this bullshit pedaling with my feet thing.
[17302.21s -> 17303.17s]  I want to go full speed.
[17304.58s -> 17305.78s]  On the motorcycle.
[17306.58s -> 17323.20s]  Is that a building?
[17324.34s -> 17326.02s]  Oh God, this bullshit again.
[17326.02s -> 17326.58s]  All right.
[17326.58s -> 17333.83s]  I need to, I was trying to block the sun out of my eyes.
[17333.83s -> 17346.60s]  That's better.
[17347.22s -> 17347.72s]  Sun's gone.
[17350.45s -> 17350.95s]  Shit!
[17353.12s -> 17353.62s]  It's fine.
[17354.00s -> 17354.96s]  It's fine.
[17354.96s -> 17355.36s]  It's fine.
[17355.36s -> 17355.76s]  It's fine.
[17355.76s -> 17356.26s]  We're fine.
[17356.80s -> 17357.92s]  Are we?
[17357.92s -> 17358.42s]  Are we though?
[17359.04s -> 17359.54s]  Are we though?
[17361.60s -> 17362.24s]  Are we though?
[17365.78s -> 17366.98s]  Oh, watch out for that thing!
[17367.62s -> 17391.09s]  It's a pothead.
[17391.09s -> 17393.01s]  I'm not, I'm not, I've had none.
[17393.01s -> 17394.61s]  I've had none today.
[17395.17s -> 17397.60s]  I was feeling, I was feeling okay today.
[17397.60s -> 17398.24s]  Chest wise.
[17398.24s -> 17399.92s]  I didn't, I don't need to take it right now.
[17399.92s -> 17402.02s]  I'm saying that or you're going to get banned.
[17404.07s -> 17404.57s]  Idiot.
[17427.08s -> 17429.56s]  Okay, that, somebody is standing right behind here.
[17429.56s -> 17432.21s]  Crouching where the other tire is on the other side.
[17432.21s -> 17434.45s]  They scared me with a puppet and threw it behind them.
[17434.45s -> 17437.20s]  And then they're hiding under the car.
[17437.20s -> 17439.44s]  I'm going to go investigate this fucking thing and the car is going to take off.
[17440.00s -> 17444.52s]  God damn it, man.
[17445.32s -> 17468.37s]  Hey, I told you I was going to need this.
[17468.37s -> 17470.29s]  Great, I really used it well.
[17470.29s -> 17484.63s]  Let's go.
[17484.63s -> 17486.07s]  Oh, I'm not going to bring Wilson.
[17486.07s -> 17487.27s]  I need a new house.
[17504.53s -> 17505.49s]  You have a nice hall.
[17508.10s -> 17509.94s]  Please say that you'll play this again.
[17509.94s -> 17510.42s]  I don't know.
[17511.06s -> 17512.42s]  Maybe if it gets some more updates.
[17512.42s -> 17513.86s]  Isn't it currently not done?
[17514.66s -> 17518.28s]  I'm going to hit that rock, aren't I?
[17518.28s -> 17523.00s]  Nope.
[17523.00s -> 17523.50s]  Sleep?
[17523.96s -> 17543.03s]  Okay, the tank is now in the front seat.
[17553.89s -> 17555.65s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[17558.60s -> 17560.04s]  Just draining into my mouth.
[17564.29s -> 17565.17s]  Oh, God damn it.
[17565.17s -> 17566.13s]  There's a thing right here too.
[17566.69s -> 17573.03s]  Just reload the bucket save.
[17573.03s -> 17573.83s]  I don't care.
[17573.83s -> 17574.63s]  Where is it?
[17574.63s -> 17576.76s]  This one here, right?
[17576.76s -> 17579.57s]  20, 09, 24, 16, 34.
[17579.57s -> 17580.61s]  Which one is it?
[17580.61s -> 17585.35s]  This one, right?
[17585.35s -> 17586.23s]  This one.
[17586.23s -> 17593.35s]  Reload Randy.
[17593.35s -> 17594.55s]  Well, load last.
[17594.55s -> 17595.19s]  Oh, oh shit.
[17595.19s -> 17599.94s]  Okay, we're good.
[17600.50s -> 17624.40s]  But the car turned off.
[17625.04s -> 17626.72s]  The bike is not gone.
[17627.44s -> 17631.09s]  The bike is still there.
[17631.09s -> 17631.57s]  There it is.
[17631.57s -> 17632.13s]  There's the thing.
[17634.71s -> 17635.67s]  Bike is there.
[17635.67s -> 17637.46s]  Look, that's bike.
[17638.10s -> 17645.91s]  These little bus stops.
[17645.91s -> 17647.59s]  Why can't I find a bus?
[17647.59s -> 17649.67s]  I got one in the very beginning of the game.
[17649.67s -> 17651.03s]  I didn't have any gas or any diesel.
[17651.03s -> 17651.67s]  I couldn't use it.
[17652.47s -> 17653.92s]  I want to drive a bus so bad.
[17654.48s -> 17655.20s]  You have no idea.
[17655.92s -> 17660.71s]  All right, looking for tires.
[17661.27s -> 17664.53s]  If I see a tire, I'm going to be really happy.
[17665.25s -> 17666.36s]  I see one.
[17667.08s -> 17668.93s]  I see a tire.
[17669.65s -> 17680.21s]  That's kind of huge though.
[17680.21s -> 17682.37s]  Will this work?
[17682.37s -> 17683.09s]  Can I even put it on?
[17683.73s -> 17688.12s]  This shit ain't going to work.
[17688.12s -> 17689.00s]  It's too big.
[17689.00s -> 17706.37s]  Can I paint the bike?
[17706.37s -> 17708.45s]  Oh, there we go.
[17709.41s -> 17709.91s]  Working.
[17719.80s -> 17721.24s]  Spray paint your face.
[17721.24s -> 17721.74s]  No.
[17770.39s -> 17770.79s]  Empty?
[17770.79s -> 17771.11s]  What?
[17771.11s -> 17771.83s]  I just...
[17771.83s -> 17775.54s]  A new bumper.
[17776.66s -> 17777.16s]  Definitely.
[17779.51s -> 17781.43s]  Oh, look at this thing.
[17781.43s -> 17784.39s]  This is Radio SteelPens News.
[17784.39s -> 17785.99s]  The latest news for you.
[17788.73s -> 17790.41s]  Today, it's harder than ever.
[17790.41s -> 17795.48s]  I can say, seriously, I wanted to tell you some news,
[17795.48s -> 17798.44s]  but since 90% of the people died in the apocalypse,
[17798.44s -> 17799.96s]  I can't really tell you anything.
[17800.76s -> 17804.84s]  But I can bring you some amazing ball-busting rap music.
[17804.84s -> 17805.80s]  Listen to this.
[17813.88s -> 17815.08s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[17815.08s -> 17815.96s]  Disgusting.
[17815.96s -> 17816.46s]  Why?
[17825.51s -> 17829.43s]  Let's store it in here.
[17831.83s -> 17833.51s]  This is way too loud.
[17834.47s -> 17848.86s]  We're on 98.4.
[17849.58s -> 17875.85s]  Oh no, tires.
[17875.85s -> 17876.25s]  Stop.
[17876.25s -> 17876.75s]  What?
[17883.13s -> 17884.41s]  Get it out of my hands.
[17884.41s -> 17885.53s]  Get it off my hands.
[17885.53s -> 17886.03s]  Ew.
[17886.41s -> 17887.21s]  Disgusting.
[17887.21s -> 17888.33s]  Get rid of this.
[17888.33s -> 17888.83s]  Get rid...
[17898.92s -> 17899.72s]  Put this back on.
[17905.85s -> 17906.97s]  There's more?
[17906.97s -> 17908.81s]  Oh shit, there is.
[17908.81s -> 17910.25s]  Oh my god.
[17910.25s -> 17911.61s]  Why is there so much of this?
[17918.98s -> 17920.10s]  I don't want to show that in the vlog.
[17923.72s -> 17925.24s]  This is like MIDI vlog music.
[17926.26s -> 17927.22s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[17927.22s -> 17928.18s]  Vlog music, right.
[17928.18s -> 17928.74s]  Okay, hold on.
[17929.46s -> 17972.30s]  Pay attention.
[17972.30s -> 17973.26s]  The road is...
[17976.02s -> 17977.86s]  You're just watching a vlog in this slowly,
[17977.86s -> 17980.58s]  just going way off the fucking road.
[17980.58s -> 17983.78s]  It's like, whoa, dude, somebody should probably pay attention.
[17987.80s -> 17988.52s]  Where are they?
[17991.67s -> 17992.79s]  I can't crash like that.
[17992.79s -> 17993.83s]  I know you all want me to,
[17993.83s -> 17996.15s]  but it would be over at that point.
[17996.15s -> 17997.19s]  I'm not going to start over.
[17997.19s -> 17999.51s]  This is NeonSynth Radio.
[17999.51s -> 18000.31s]  Get on the road.
[18000.79s -> 18005.06s]  There is almost as hot as me, my friends.
[18005.06s -> 18007.42s]  Well, really, I am much, much...
[18007.42s -> 18012.15s]  Last week, we had a call that said...
[18012.15s -> 18012.95s]  I missed the mirror.
[18012.95s -> 18013.43s]  Don't you...
[18013.43s -> 18014.79s]  I so badly missed the mirror.
[18014.79s -> 18017.67s]  ...steel pants radio, but seriously,
[18017.67s -> 18019.67s]  how can you say something like that?
[18019.67s -> 18022.23s]  I mean, that dude is a douchebag,
[18022.23s -> 18024.87s]  and he has serious personality disorders,
[18024.87s -> 18027.78s]  or bipolar, or bisexual stuff,
[18027.78s -> 18028.90s]  or I don't know.
[18028.90s -> 18032.26s]  And he even works alone because everyone hates him.
[18032.26s -> 18034.82s]  I have so much coworkers,
[18034.82s -> 18041.86s]  and he has, guess what, not NeonSynth Radio FM 98.4.
[18041.86s -> 18043.86s]  Some weather forecast for you guys.
[18043.86s -> 18046.66s]  Mostly the weather will be sunny,
[18046.66s -> 18049.06s]  just like my life and yours.
[18049.06s -> 18053.38s]  Let's make it even better with one of my favorite songs.
[18053.38s -> 18054.90s]  Jennifer, hit it.
[18054.90s -> 18064.47s]  NeonSynth Radio FM 98.4.
[18064.47s -> 18065.27s]  Jeremy, what?
[18065.91s -> 18068.18s]  More mirror jokes.
[18068.18s -> 18068.58s]  That's not...
[18068.58s -> 18069.38s]  I just can't...
[18069.38s -> 18070.02s]  I have to look.
[18070.82s -> 18073.98s]  Isn't there an animal that if it sees its reflection,
[18073.98s -> 18075.42s]  it freezes and just goes,
[18075.42s -> 18076.70s]  I need to stare at you now.
[18076.70s -> 18077.58s]  Whatever it is, that's me.
[18078.38s -> 18079.18s]  All right, new radio.
[18092.54s -> 18094.14s]  The same guys on every radio station.
[18094.78s -> 18100.82s]  There we go.
[18100.82s -> 18111.30s]  I would love to find a tire.
[18111.30s -> 18112.02s]  That would be great.
[18112.58s -> 18117.51s]  It's too loud.
[18129.74s -> 18130.62s]  Max volume.
[18130.62s -> 18132.14s]  I don't think I want to do that to you guys.
[18132.70s -> 18133.58s]  I feel like that would hurt.
[18143.48s -> 18144.20s]  Fine.
[18144.20s -> 18148.87s]  Okay, I'm gonna...
[18149.99s -> 18153.78s]  That's way too loud.
[18153.78s -> 18154.34s]  I don't like it.
[18159.45s -> 18160.09s]  Normal level.
[18160.81s -> 18180.87s]  Drive on the road.
[18181.43s -> 18182.07s]  Yeah, I know.
[18182.07s -> 18183.67s]  But isn't the road probably more dangerous
[18183.67s -> 18184.95s]  because of random rocks?
[18184.95s -> 18187.14s]  I can see the rocks from a mile away
[18187.14s -> 18188.34s]  if I drive on the other side.
[18191.50s -> 18192.54s]  Louder and floor it.
[18192.54s -> 18194.46s]  This is as fast as this little shitty engine can go.
[18197.37s -> 18198.73s]  It can't go much faster than this.
[18199.29s -> 18208.76s]  Look, you want to see?
[18209.40s -> 18210.36s]  You want to see the engine?
[18211.16s -> 18211.40s]  Look.
[18212.20s -> 18213.40s]  It's not very good.
[18214.66s -> 18215.78s]  It's pretty slow.
[18218.20s -> 18218.60s]  Hold on.
[18219.40s -> 18225.46s]  I gotta give it a little more extra cooling.
[18237.37s -> 18238.25s]  On every station.
[18238.25s -> 18238.89s]  Get out of here.
[18238.89s -> 18244.62s]  All right.
[18244.62s -> 18246.60s]  All right, if I'm going fast enough,
[18246.60s -> 18250.20s]  can this start to spray out into my mouth
[18250.20s -> 18251.64s]  and I can drink it while I'm driving?
[18252.68s -> 18256.87s]  Can I just drink this coolant while I'm driving?
[18257.51s -> 18258.55s]  If it goes fast enough?
[18259.35s -> 18260.07s]  Close the cap.
[18260.07s -> 18260.55s]  Hold on.
[18260.55s -> 18261.11s]  I got it.
[18262.78s -> 18263.42s]  It is open.
[18263.42s -> 18263.98s]  You're right.
[18267.69s -> 18269.29s]  Why do I want to do this so bad?
[18269.29s -> 18270.25s]  It's not even funny.
[18274.82s -> 18275.38s]  Okay, what...
[18275.38s -> 18275.86s]  Wait.
[18276.02s -> 18276.26s]  funny
[18296.76s -> 18298.60s]  Goddamn, what a long road trip this is.
[18299.40s -> 18304.23s]  I'm getting so fucking thirsty.
[18305.11s -> 18306.63s]  And I got no Gatorade in the car.
[18307.51s -> 18308.23s]  That's empty.
[18312.81s -> 18314.33s]  Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[18326.30s -> 18327.18s]  I can't drink it.
[18327.18s -> 18327.74s]  I'm trying.
[18328.06s -> 18330.78s]  I have to use your two-stroke vehicle urgently.
[18330.78s -> 18333.42s]  Someone, please give me a two-stroke now.
[18333.42s -> 18339.66s]  I have to go to the toilet urgently, but I only drive with a two-stroke vehicle into the toilet.
[18344.62s -> 18345.58s]  We go back here?
[18345.58s -> 18347.74s]  Do you want to be you in the backseat?
[18347.74s -> 18353.75s]  Germany is always the best.
[18353.75s -> 18355.19s]  Oh, fuck! That's a pole!
[18355.19s -> 18356.55s]  It has sand, but it also has a lot of dust.
[18356.55s -> 18357.91s]  Alright, it's you in the backseat, guys.
[18357.91s -> 18360.07s]  Yes, you have a good ear tip, panna.
[18360.07s -> 18363.67s]  Germany still has a small forest.
[18363.67s -> 18367.66s]  Are we there yet, are we there yet?
[18367.66s -> 18371.82s]  Shut up! Quiet back there!
[18373.18s -> 18376.74s]  We've got another 250 miles at least.
[18376.74s -> 18379.38s]  Here, have some drinks of gasoline.
[18380.70s -> 18381.58s]  You'll feel better.
[18384.84s -> 18385.72s]  I don't like that.
[18385.72s -> 18388.12s]  It's alright, we'll stop somewhere and get some Powerade.
[18388.12s -> 18389.72s]  The purple Powerade, my favorite.
[18398.06s -> 18399.02s]  Want to sing a car song?
[18399.74s -> 18401.26s]  Um, no.
[18403.18s -> 18408.06s]  I spy with my little eye something that is orange.
[18412.55s -> 18413.91s]  Is it the sky?
[18413.91s -> 18414.39s]  You got it!
[18414.39s -> 18415.19s]  That's my son!
[18415.19s -> 18415.67s]  He got it!
[18415.67s -> 18417.91s]  It's the sky and everything else.
[18417.91s -> 18418.55s]  You got it!
[18420.07s -> 18421.86s]  Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!
[18421.86s -> 18422.36s]  Shh!
[18423.50s -> 18423.98s]  We got him.
[18423.98s -> 18425.18s]  We got a little bit of him.
[18425.18s -> 18426.54s]  Dad's going to get out of the car for a bit.
[18428.39s -> 18429.11s]  He's sitting right here.
[18429.99s -> 18432.58s]  Here, just put on your favorite radio.
[18435.30s -> 18436.58s]  Dad, I'll be back in a few minutes.
[18438.10s -> 18438.58s]  I'll be back.
[18438.58s -> 18440.58s]  Oh, let's just go to bed.
[18455.08s -> 18459.40s]  It's so funny with the car idling at volume 10.
[18460.68s -> 18461.72s]  This poor kid.
[18465.29s -> 18470.39s]  Oh, just do F10 for the kids cam.
[18471.03s -> 18473.78s]  Do I have four?
[18473.78s -> 18474.28s]  Okay.
[18480.63s -> 18481.13s]  Hey!
[18485.43s -> 18488.63s]  Try to keep my eye on the road, son.
[18489.27s -> 18491.74s]  Done.
[18492.28s -> 18493.08s]  Yeah.
[18493.08s -> 18494.58s]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[18494.58s -> 18495.54s]  Just hang tight.
[18496.34s -> 18498.66s]  If you get thirsty, just bring a gasoline in the backseat.
[18503.96s -> 18511.29s]  Don't go anywhere.
[18511.29s -> 18512.33s]  Hey, son!
[18512.33s -> 18513.05s]  Hey, son!
[18513.05s -> 18513.93s]  I found something!
[18514.49s -> 18515.45s]  I found something!
[18516.01s -> 18522.12s]  This is going to look real good.
[18522.76s -> 18526.68s]  Your favorite color, blue.
[18527.48s -> 18528.39s]  You see it?
[18530.10s -> 18533.64s]  Oh, I got to be careful.
[18533.64s -> 18535.16s]  Blue's not my favorite color.
[18535.80s -> 18536.68s]  That's, son.
[18536.68s -> 18537.18s]  What happened?
[18538.06s -> 18539.10s]  Oh, I didn't hear you.
[18539.10s -> 18540.46s]  I thought you said blue's my favorite color.
[18541.10s -> 18546.17s]  Hey, your dear old dad will be right back.
[18555.27s -> 18558.15s]  And look what your dear old dad just found.
[18558.87s -> 18561.26s]  People leave this crazy shit around, son.
[18561.26s -> 18563.42s]  Yellow power rate.
[18566.04s -> 18573.13s]  What's up?
[18573.13s -> 18575.61s]  Son, we got a problem here.
[18575.61s -> 18576.11s]  Son!
[18577.21s -> 18582.81s]  Turn it on.
[18582.81s -> 18588.58s]  There's a fucking UFO.
[18599.19s -> 18600.55s]  Dad, I didn't see anything.
[18600.55s -> 18601.35s]  What are you talking about?
[18601.99s -> 18603.43s]  You didn't see the UFO fly overhead?
[18604.71s -> 18606.87s]  Dad, I didn't see anything at all.
[18609.64s -> 18610.20s]  Are you sure?
[18611.53s -> 18612.03s]  No.
[18612.49s -> 18614.49s]  There was food, I think, in that house.
[18614.49s -> 18614.73s]  Food?
[18614.73s -> 18615.29s]  What are you talking about?
[18615.29s -> 18616.25s]  Are you fucking crazy?
[18617.13s -> 18618.49s]  The UFO just flew overhead.
[18618.49s -> 18619.13s]  What are you, a dove?
[18621.82s -> 18624.30s]  I don't want to drink anymore.
[18624.30s -> 18626.22s]  I think you should stop drinking gasoline.
[18628.12s -> 18630.52s]  Gasoline is the most delicious fluid there is.
[18634.18s -> 18634.90s]  Don't move.
[18634.90s -> 18635.62s]  You won't get hurt.
[18647.19s -> 18648.63s]  Okay, we're going back on the road.
[18648.63s -> 18649.75s]  I'm going to catch that UFO.
[18661.05s -> 18661.55s]  Rabbit!
[18662.09s -> 18666.46s]  Dad, why did you do that?
[18667.35s -> 18667.85s]  What?
[18688.58s -> 18689.14s]  Hey, son.
[18689.70s -> 18690.82s]  Did you know your dad could do this?
[18695.11s -> 18696.07s]  Oh my god.
[18697.54s -> 18699.70s]  Yeah, your dad looks kind of like Beetlejuice, doesn't he?
[18700.42s -> 18715.13s]  Can you drop me off at the sound?
[18715.94s -> 18717.70s]  Is it piercing my ears?
[18718.26s -> 18725.22s]  I'm missing a tire?
[18725.94s -> 18727.58s]  What?
[18741.08s -> 18750.46s]  Wait, put this back on.
[18750.46s -> 18751.34s]  The spare.
[18751.34s -> 18752.46s]  Yeah, it's all right.
[18752.46s -> 18752.96s]  Whatever.
[18754.41s -> 18755.53s]  Is it front wheel drive?
[18756.09s -> 18773.14s]  If it's front wheel drive, then I'm just taking this off.
[18773.14s -> 18774.18s]  It's rear wheel drive.
[18774.18s -> 18776.50s]  It's rear wheel drive.
[18776.50s -> 18790.92s]  Okay, two rear tires.
[18790.92s -> 18795.46s]  This one kind of looks messed up, though, doesn't it?
[18795.46s -> 18798.47s]  It's one of the door.
[18798.47s -> 18805.91s]  No, we're good.
[18805.91s -> 18807.27s]  All right, we just need a gas station.
[18809.86s -> 18810.66s]  Hey, doobie roller.
[18810.66s -> 18812.02s]  Thanks for the 10 community subs, doobie.
[18812.58s -> 18816.54s]  I'll take them.
[18817.02s -> 18817.98s]  It's 10 subs.
[18818.54s -> 18819.51s]  Thanks, dude.
[18820.07s -> 18830.98s]  Scooby dooby roller.
[18830.98s -> 18832.66s]  Oh, fuck, I'm hungry.
[18832.66s -> 18833.54s]  What about you?
[18833.54s -> 18834.98s]  All right, I got to make a decision here.
[18838.50s -> 18849.74s]  I'm going to say whatever.
[18849.74s -> 18850.38s]  I can stay there.
[18854.07s -> 18854.79s]  Papa John's.
[18856.73s -> 18857.85s]  Why would I eat Papa John's?
[18858.41s -> 18865.93s]  Papa John's sits in this weird sort of limbo of pizza places.
[18865.93s -> 18867.69s]  It's not that good to order.
[18867.69s -> 18869.85s]  It's not that bad to care about that you ate it.
[18871.06s -> 18872.26s]  But I don't want it.
[18879.51s -> 18881.99s]  There are much better pizza places that I would eat before Papa John's.
[18882.07s -> 18882.95s]  So I would never order it.
[18884.79s -> 18885.43s]  That's just a fact.
[18886.39s -> 18887.19s]  That's just how I feel.
[18888.15s -> 18889.27s]  I haven't you want to hear?
[18889.27s -> 18889.83s]  Here's a fact.
[18890.31s -> 18898.39s]  I have never ever in my entire life picked up the telephone and ordered a pizza from Papa John's.
[18900.06s -> 18907.10s]  There's been maybe three or four times where it was just cold sitting out at somebody's Super Bowl party.
[18907.74s -> 18909.42s]  And I had maybe one or two slices.
[18911.83s -> 18912.87s]  I've never ordered it before.
[18913.19s -> 18916.31s]  I've just eaten it maybe once at a football party game thing.
[18917.19s -> 18923.37s]  How can you judge it then?
[18923.37s -> 18924.41s]  I just don't want it.
[18924.41s -> 18924.89s]  I've had it.
[18925.61s -> 18927.29s]  Look, I just don't want it.
[18927.93s -> 18931.96s]  See, back in Massachusetts, we had Papa Gino's.
[18931.96s -> 18933.40s]  Papa Gino's was way better than Papa John's.
[18933.40s -> 18935.08s]  Papa Gino's was a thousand times better.
[18938.65s -> 18941.85s]  If you ordered Papa John's instead of Papa Gino's and you're from New England.
[18941.85s -> 18943.13s]  Oh my God.
[18943.13s -> 18944.25s]  No, you wouldn't do that.
[18944.25s -> 18945.45s]  There would be no reason for you to do that.
[18946.17s -> 18951.90s]  So now, since I've moved across country, there's no more Papa Gino's anywhere, right?
[18951.90s -> 18953.66s]  That's an East Coast kind of New England thing.
[18954.81s -> 18956.89s]  But I'm not going to order Papa John's still
[18956.89s -> 18958.89s]  because there are other places out here that are better than that.
[18959.61s -> 18961.91s]  Turn on the radio.
[18961.91s -> 18962.71s]  I am the radio.
[18975.35s -> 18976.47s]  Where are the ads?
[18977.85s -> 18981.21s]  Like the mid-roll things that Twitch decided was a great idea.
[18981.21s -> 18981.93s]  I think they deleted them.
[18981.93s -> 18982.97s]  I don't think they exist anymore.
[18995.24s -> 18996.76s]  This car is still going.
[18996.76s -> 18998.44s]  I haven't even used that much gas either.
[18999.16s -> 19001.82s]  I want B, I want B.
[19002.62s -> 19017.10s]  There you go.
[19020.46s -> 19020.94s]  Press C.
[19021.58s -> 19023.58s]  I didn't even know this existed.
[19025.59s -> 19027.11s]  It's been five hours and 20 minutes.
[19027.11s -> 19027.99s]  I didn't even know you could do this.
[19049.85s -> 19050.89s]  Good save.
[19050.89s -> 19055.66s]  I've been driving on three wheels for five hours.
[19055.66s -> 19057.90s]  No, that just happened like maybe 20 minutes ago.
[19063.05s -> 19064.09s]  We got something over here.
[19067.03s -> 19068.23s]  Yeah, I'm aware that I'm missing a wheel.
[19068.23s -> 19069.35s]  What would you like me to do about it?
[19069.35s -> 19069.85s]  Walk?
[19076.44s -> 19081.45s]  I'll get a wheel right here.
[19081.45s -> 19084.55s]  I see a wheel.
[19086.74s -> 19088.18s]  I see a wheel.
[19088.18s -> 19089.14s]  I see a wheel.
[19089.14s -> 19090.34s]  I see two wheels.
[19091.14s -> 19092.26s]  Oh, yeah.
[19094.28s -> 19094.78s]  Yes.
[19095.83s -> 19096.33s]  Yes.
[19096.71s -> 19099.29s]  Take it on there.
[19100.62s -> 19101.42s]  Back in business.
[19102.55s -> 19102.95s]  Hooray.
[19102.95s -> 19103.67s]  All right, there's another one here.
[19103.67s -> 19105.93s]  Let's put it on the trailer.
[19113.14s -> 19113.62s]  Thank God.
[19113.62s -> 19114.42s]  At least I could have one.
[19114.98s -> 19121.10s]  Anything else?
[19121.66s -> 19122.33s]  What's this?
[19123.22s -> 19123.86s]  Ammo?
[19123.86s -> 19124.42s]  I don't care.
[19124.42s -> 19125.30s]  I have a thousand.
[19125.30s -> 19135.40s]  You can change it up a little bit here.
[19135.40s -> 19148.36s]  Maybe a Herman bike?
[19149.00s -> 19149.96s]  Yeah, I think so.
[19154.47s -> 19155.99s]  Cotton candy car.
[19155.99s -> 19162.33s]  Come on, do it.
[19162.33s -> 19169.45s]  I can't believe I'm still playing this though.
[19169.45s -> 19170.41s]  I really can't.
[19170.41s -> 19172.22s]  Why do I like this so much?
[19172.22s -> 19173.94s]  That didn't even go out the window.
[19174.58s -> 19176.26s]  By the way, that would have stuck to the window.
[19176.26s -> 19177.46s]  As disgusting as that sounds.
[19178.65s -> 19180.17s]  Finally, I can actually move.
[19180.97s -> 19188.97s]  That was not a house though.
[19195.67s -> 19196.55s]  That thing on the right.
[19197.94s -> 19198.66s]  It's a gas tank.
[19203.77s -> 19206.17s]  No, it's a Minecraft diamond block.
[19206.73s -> 19208.74s]  Why do I think I'm driving so erratically?
[19209.30s -> 19210.42s]  Worth a lot of fucking money.
[19222.39s -> 19223.59s]  Erotic driving?
[19225.85s -> 19227.45s]  No, erratic.
[19227.45s -> 19228.57s]  See, see, see, see.
[19229.21s -> 19230.71s]  How far back can I go?
[19231.27s -> 19241.35s]  I can't lose the Phoebe Herman bike.
[19241.35s -> 19241.99s]  I refuse.
[19246.76s -> 19248.12s]  I can see too much.
[19248.12s -> 19250.02s]  You know what I mean?
[19250.02s -> 19251.54s]  I feel like I can see way too much.
[19252.18s -> 19265.43s]  I want to ride this so bad.
[19266.44s -> 19269.56s]  All right, guys, tell me the truth.
[19270.04s -> 19273.24s]  I've got gas and I have gas and oil in here.
[19273.80s -> 19275.24s]  Can I ride this fucking bike?
[19275.80s -> 19280.62s]  If I put two wheels on this, fill it and then turn it on.
[19280.62s -> 19282.30s]  No, you need an engine for it.
[19282.30s -> 19282.94s]  What the hell?
[19283.58s -> 19285.70s]  Can I put my car engine on it?
[19293.03s -> 19295.06s]  No.
[19295.06s -> 19295.78s]  Yes.
[19295.78s -> 19298.14s]  It's not how that works.
[19302.98s -> 19304.02s]  I can though.
[19305.94s -> 19306.58s]  Why not?
[19307.90s -> 19308.38s]  Let's go.
[19315.70s -> 19316.10s]  Try it.
[19317.13s -> 19318.25s]  The next pit stop I will.
[19328.22s -> 19328.70s]  Wrong way.
[19328.70s -> 19329.66s]  No, the things are on the right.
[19330.22s -> 19347.82s]  I can't believe I'm still driving.
[19347.82s -> 19350.98s]  We've got the kid.
[19351.94s -> 19352.66s]  It's all right.
[19352.66s -> 19356.18s]  He'll put his thumb in the ear and some horror movie character will pick him up.
[19356.18s -> 19357.78s]  Oh, no, I'm out of control.
[19366.58s -> 19367.06s]  Bad view.
[19373.88s -> 19376.76s]  Look, okay, is he the main character or am I the main character?
[19376.76s -> 19379.48s]  It's really important because if he's the main character, he's going to be just fine.
[19382.49s -> 19385.53s]  An eagle will come pick him up for all that matters if he's the main character.
[19393.98s -> 19395.18s]  It's okay.
[19395.74s -> 19398.63s]  It's all right.
[19398.63s -> 19399.43s]  Just give me the...
[19403.40s -> 19405.16s]  This fucking bike is going to be the end.
[19411.62s -> 19414.10s]  I swear to God, I saw your character fly out the windshield.
[19414.10s -> 19414.66s]  Can you clip it?
[19414.66s -> 19415.14s]  Are you sure?
[19415.70s -> 19424.55s]  Did that actually happen?
[19424.55s -> 19437.98s]  Wait, you can put the car engine in it.
[19437.98s -> 19441.13s]  It's better be a one guy moment or I'm going to be very annoyed.
[19469.46s -> 19479.80s]  Give air.
[19479.80s -> 19481.80s]  Yes.
[19481.80s -> 19482.68s]  Save the game.
[19482.68s -> 19495.11s]  The moped runs on two stroke fuel as used in the Trabant with a cruising speed of approximately 50.
[19495.11s -> 19498.31s]  To start the moped, climb on by looking at the seat by pressing E.
[19498.31s -> 19499.51s]  Press I to switch the ignition.
[19499.51s -> 19503.43s]  Press space to lift the stick, hold W.
[19503.43s -> 19504.07s]  Okay.
[19504.07s -> 19512.98s]  So I need oil and gas in here.
[19512.98s -> 19514.02s]  Oil and gas in there.
[19515.86s -> 19517.94s]  Add oil and fuel.
[19517.94s -> 19520.33s]  Do we even have any oil though?
[19520.33s -> 19522.90s]  Might be in trouble here.
[19522.90s -> 19541.08s]  Okay.
[19541.08s -> 19544.42s]  Do I have oil?
[19544.42s -> 19554.63s]  I need oil.
[19554.63s -> 19556.79s]  That's water in there, isn't it?
[19557.51s -> 19558.47s]  Move this out of the way for a minute.
[19558.47s -> 19559.35s]  I need to look.
[19559.35s -> 19566.68s]  This water oil in the engine.
[19567.72s -> 19578.62s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[19578.62s -> 19588.34s]  How much oil?
[19588.34s -> 19588.58s]  All right.
[19588.58s -> 19591.46s]  How much oil?
[19591.46s -> 19592.10s]  Four?
[19592.10s -> 19596.23s]  Four percent or three percent?
[19596.23s -> 19598.52s]  Three percent.
[19598.52s -> 19598.92s]  That's it.
[19599.48s -> 19600.20s]  Okay, good.
[19600.20s -> 19600.92s]  Now I'm going to...
[19601.56s -> 19602.04s]  Can I put...
[19602.04s -> 19602.84s]  All right, hold on.
[19602.84s -> 19606.65s]  Another massive amount of fucking subs just came in.
[19606.65s -> 19607.29s]  Holy shit.
[19607.29s -> 19609.69s]  Another 20 from the chef's corner.
[19610.87s -> 19611.91s]  Thank you, chef's corner.
[19611.91s -> 19622.22s]  That's a shitload of money.
[19622.22s -> 19622.94s]  All right.
[19622.94s -> 19623.90s]  Is that good?
[19623.90s -> 19643.58s]  This isn't doing anything.
[19643.58s -> 19644.38s]  It's no engine.
[19645.02s -> 19645.58s]  Fuck.
[19649.77s -> 19650.65s]  Look down.
[19650.65s -> 19652.01s]  I know there's no engine.
[19652.01s -> 19652.73s]  I know, I know.
[19652.73s -> 19655.42s]  Okay, but cap that, please.
[19656.97s -> 19657.69s]  Get back up.
[19657.69s -> 19658.25s]  Stand it up.
[19661.05s -> 19661.61s]  Okay.
[19661.61s -> 19667.78s]  Put the car engine in it.
[19678.36s -> 19679.00s]  Did that work?
[19690.10s -> 19690.90s]  Oh, fuck.
[19690.90s -> 19691.38s]  Easy.
[19691.38s -> 19692.18s]  Careful.
[19692.18s -> 19698.68s]  I'm going to put the kickstand up.
[19698.68s -> 19699.56s]  Oh my god.
[19699.56s -> 19699.96s]  Whatever.
[19699.96s -> 19700.68s]  Just...
[19700.68s -> 19709.54s]  Why is it such a pain in the ass?
[19709.54s -> 19711.70s]  I can't put the kickstand up while it's...
[19724.94s -> 19726.22s]  God.
[19741.43s -> 19751.29s]  You motherfucker.
[19751.29s -> 19751.61s]  All right.
[19751.61s -> 19752.33s]  It's ready.
[19752.33s -> 19754.66s]  It's ready, it's ready, it's ready.
[19754.66s -> 19765.94s]  Is it going?
[19765.94s -> 19773.58s]  It still doesn't work.
[19774.14s -> 19780.36s]  It's because I'm pedaling.
[19780.36s -> 19781.56s]  It's just a bicycle.
[19782.12s -> 19783.61s]  This isn't using any gas.
[19784.41s -> 19798.15s]  I'm the energy.
[19798.15s -> 19798.71s]  Old eye.
[19798.71s -> 19800.33s]  See you later, sucker.
[19802.33s -> 19806.73s]  It's so hard to control.
[19807.93s -> 19818.92s]  It's impossible to control.
[19819.72s -> 19820.76s]  Oh, the kickstand.
[19820.76s -> 19825.18s]  No, the kickstand.
[19825.82s -> 19827.26s]  Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.
[19827.26s -> 19847.61s]  Is that another UFO?
[19847.61s -> 19851.77s]  Oh my fucking god damn it.
[19851.77s -> 19862.06s]  Why does this have to be like this?
[19862.06s -> 19883.70s]  Why does it have to do this?
[19883.70s -> 19885.14s]  Why can't I just sit it up?
[19885.14s -> 19885.86s]  Turn the kickstand on?
[19885.86s -> 19886.58s]  I can.
[19886.58s -> 19887.67s]  Wrong way.
[19887.67s -> 19888.87s]  Let's move.
[19888.87s -> 19889.91s]  Oh, really?
[19889.91s -> 19904.57s]  No, you can't.
[19904.57s -> 19915.48s]  Why is it two of us?
[19915.48s -> 19930.06s]  Why is it two of us?
[19930.06s -> 19933.66s]  Why is it two of us?
[19933.66s -> 19941.58s]  Why is it two of us?
[19942.06s -> 19943.18s]  Why is it two of me?
[19943.18s -> 19945.48s]  Is it two of me?
[19946.04s -> 19946.84s]  You see that?
[19946.84s -> 19948.82s]  Why is it two of us on the bike?
[19948.82s -> 19972.44s]  Is this shit out of gas?
[19972.44s -> 19974.12s]  Stop doing that with your hand, man.
[19974.12s -> 19979.08s]  What are you...
[19979.08s -> 19980.44s]  Stop doing that.
[19981.08s -> 19992.65s]  I don't know why he's doing that.
[19992.65s -> 20027.40s]  It's overheating.
[20027.40s -> 20028.52s]  Stop doing that.
[20028.52s -> 20037.86s]  Okay, you done?
[20043.00s -> 20043.72s]  There we go.
[20043.72s -> 20044.12s]  Thank you.
[20050.78s -> 20051.18s]  Stop.
[20067.03s -> 20068.39s]  There's no radiator.
[20069.11s -> 20071.11s]  But how do you get a radiator on here?
[20071.99s -> 20073.27s]  This is not how this works.
[20091.14s -> 20092.26s]  Make the gun talk?
[20093.54s -> 20093.94s]  No.
[20093.94s -> 20094.50s]  What?
[20094.50s -> 20098.18s]  Why did you tell me to shoot the engine?
[20098.74s -> 20100.33s]  Are you out of your mind?
[20118.95s -> 20120.15s]  This sucks.
[20120.15s -> 20128.92s]  If I just piss, will it go?
[20129.64s -> 20131.72s]  I think that kind of works.
[20132.28s -> 20146.62s]  No more piss.
[20147.93s -> 20148.81s]  Oh, no.
[20148.81s -> 20150.25s]  This can't be the end.
[20150.25s -> 20151.91s]  Time to walk?
[20152.47s -> 20154.39s]  This goes faster than walking.
[20154.39s -> 20157.78s]  I can't believe there's no radiator.
[20158.42s -> 20159.70s]  How was I supposed to know that?
[20160.26s -> 20162.90s]  Reload to the car?
[20162.90s -> 20163.78s]  No, no, nope.
[20163.78s -> 20164.18s]  I can't.
[20164.82s -> 20165.46s]  I'm just going.
[20166.10s -> 20169.13s]  Don't worry.
[20169.13s -> 20169.69s]  I'll be fine.
[20170.25s -> 20176.63s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[20177.27s -> 20185.19s]  What's wrong with his body?
[20185.83s -> 20186.31s]  What did I?
[20186.31s -> 20215.06s]  Why is he doing this right now?
[20215.06s -> 20216.42s]  I think that was probably part of the problem.
[20216.42s -> 20217.22s]  I'll be honest.
[20217.22s -> 20220.07s]  I think that's why that was happening.
[20220.07s -> 20224.42s]  I really do.
[20224.42s -> 20225.62s]  John Arbuckle.
[20225.62s -> 20231.75s]  I don't think it needs a radiator.
[20231.75s -> 20232.79s]  I think that's bullshit.
[20232.79s -> 20261.08s]  It has a hole in it.
[20261.08s -> 20265.74s]  It's got plenty of fuel.
[20265.74s -> 20266.46s]  See?
[20266.46s -> 20267.34s]  No.
[20267.98s -> 20271.42s]  At least I'm not stretching anymore.
[20271.42s -> 20279.64s]  Just pedal for a while.
[20279.64s -> 20283.54s]  Wait for it to cool off.
[20283.54s -> 20284.34s]  All right.
[20284.34s -> 20289.78s]  Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[20289.78s -> 20291.62s]  No, I wanted to kick-stand it up.
[20291.62s -> 20318.66s]  It's empty.
[20318.66s -> 20319.54s]  Shit, wait.
[20325.37s -> 20325.61s]  No.
[20326.49s -> 20327.77s]  I so blew it.
[20328.33s -> 20329.85s]  I thought I could pee on it.
[20329.85s -> 20331.11s]  It's okay.
[20331.11s -> 20332.23s]  There's still a little oil in there.
[20340.17s -> 20340.89s]  Whatever.
[20340.89s -> 20341.61s]  Reload.
[20341.61s -> 20343.05s]  Reload this shit.
[20343.05s -> 20343.77s]  Reload it.
[20343.77s -> 20344.33s]  Whatever.
[20362.82s -> 20363.14s]  Wait.
[20363.14s -> 20363.86s]  Radiator.
[20363.86s -> 20366.55s]  I got it.
[20366.55s -> 20395.24s]  3%.
[20395.24s -> 20403.62s]  Bingo.
[20403.62s -> 20404.18s]  Radiator.
[20404.18s -> 20404.90s]  Give it to me.
[20404.90s -> 20423.40s]  The engine with Mountain Dew.
[20424.66s -> 20425.62s]  Blast.
[20425.62s -> 20426.02s]  Okay.
[20426.02s -> 20426.66s]  Fuck this.
[20426.66s -> 20427.69s]  I'm done.
[20427.69s -> 20428.25s]  I'm done.
[20428.25s -> 20429.21s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[20429.21s -> 20430.09s]  I'm taking the car.
[20433.16s -> 20433.88s]  Put it all back.
[20434.44s -> 20435.32s]  You know what?
[20435.32s -> 20436.86s]  I don't need you anymore, bike.
[20436.86s -> 20437.74s]  Wait, is there oil in there?
[20437.74s -> 20438.62s]  I could use the gas.
[20438.62s -> 20447.61s]  At least I got to ride the bike once.
[20447.61s -> 20469.78s]  No.
[20470.42s -> 20480.14s]  Smashed my dick in the car door to death.
[20482.33s -> 20488.92s]  All right.
[20488.92s -> 20489.32s]  That's it.
[20489.32s -> 20490.46s]  I'm done.
[20490.46s -> 20491.10s]  That's it.
[20491.10s -> 20492.54s]  It's been about six hours.
[20492.54s -> 20493.26s]  I need to get some food.
[20493.26s -> 20496.07s]  I'm hungry and I need to get up.
[20496.07s -> 20502.58s]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[20502.58s -> 20506.44s]  I will see you guys tomorrow.
[20506.44s -> 20507.16s]  Not on this stream.
[20507.16s -> 20508.76s]  I'll be on Kitboga's stream tomorrow.
[20508.76s -> 20511.91s]  This is a lot of fun, though.
[20511.91s -> 20518.01s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[20518.01s -> 20519.21s]  It was very, very good.
[20522.97s -> 20523.61s]  I...
[20523.61s -> 20524.65s]  Yeah, tomorrow...
[20524.65s -> 20525.29s]  I will...
[20525.29s -> 20525.53s]  You know what?
[20525.53s -> 20527.21s]  I'll probably send a tweet out or something.
[20527.21s -> 20534.25s]  I would assume.
[20534.25s -> 20540.58s]  Before I'm on the stream, I'll be like,
[20540.58s -> 20541.86s]  hey, I'm coming on.
[20541.86s -> 20543.70s]  Just so people don't have to wait around, maybe.
[20543.70s -> 20544.87s]  But it should be a lot of fun.
[20544.87s -> 20545.59s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[20553.05s -> 20553.77s]  New tweet?
[20553.77s -> 20560.30s]  That's right.
[20560.30s -> 20560.94s]  Raid, raid.
[20560.94s -> 20561.10s]  All right.
[20561.10s -> 20561.66s]  Who are we going to raid?
[20564.07s -> 20564.47s]  Who have we...
[20564.47s -> 20566.63s]  We need somebody we haven't raided.
[20566.63s -> 20568.58s]  I want a new raid.
[20575.18s -> 20576.38s]  Raid yourself.
[20576.38s -> 20585.38s]  Let's see.
[20585.38s -> 20586.34s]  Who's streaming right now?
[20587.14s -> 20596.46s]  Who's streaming that we have not raided in a long time?
[20596.46s -> 20599.42s]  You know who we have not raided in a while?
[20599.98s -> 20603.42s]  Who has shown this channel tons and tons of love over the years?
[20604.46s -> 20605.26s]  It's Boxbox.
[20607.59s -> 20609.99s]  Boxbox raids this channel all the time.
[20609.99s -> 20613.02s]  And they're awesome.
[20613.02s -> 20624.41s]  You're going to do House Flipper VR.
[20624.41s -> 20632.14s]  Let me...
[20632.14s -> 20633.82s]  Yeah, we raided Lemmy last week.
[20633.82s -> 20636.90s]  I want to try to do new raids
[20636.90s -> 20640.89s]  instead of raiding the same, like, four people every time.
[20640.89s -> 20641.21s]  Let's...
[20641.21s -> 20642.25s]  We got to branch out.
[20642.25s -> 20644.33s]  We got to raid other people.
[20660.04s -> 20660.52s]  Who's this?
[20663.26s -> 20664.14s]  Wait, Wayner?
[20665.24s -> 20665.72s]  Wayner?
[20666.28s -> 20667.48s]  All right, save that one for next time.
[20668.50s -> 20670.10s]  But I did already commit to Boxbox.
[20670.50s -> 20672.42s]  Go say hello.
[20673.78s -> 20674.66s]  They are awesome.
[20675.22s -> 20677.74s]  They're playing Team Fight Tactics.
[20678.74s -> 20679.86s]  Team Fight Tactics.
[20680.42s -> 20684.31s]  Apparently, it's a try-hard day for Boxbox.
[20684.31s -> 20688.18s]  Raid someone with, like, 10 viewers.
[20688.18s -> 20688.82s]  You know, I...
[20688.82s -> 20689.22s]  Okay.
[20689.22s -> 20690.26s]  Here's why I don't want to do that.
[20690.26s -> 20694.02s]  Because maybe if, like, they really want...
[20694.02s -> 20696.58s]  If you get, like, 10,000 people dumped on you,
[20696.58s -> 20700.26s]  it's like, okay, do I have...
[20700.26s -> 20701.22s]  Can people even hear me?
[20701.22s -> 20702.90s]  Is my mic on?
[20702.90s -> 20704.02s]  That's a heart attack, yeah.
[20704.02s -> 20708.44s]  I'd rather, like, warn somebody that that was going to happen.
[20708.44s -> 20709.00s]  7K.
[20709.00s -> 20711.96s]  Well, there was 10 earlier.
[20711.96s -> 20720.89s]  Raid quick before everybody leaves.
[20720.89s -> 20724.54s]  Oh, we got to do the credits, though.
[20724.54s -> 20726.70s]  Actually, there was a shitload of people here today.
[20726.70s -> 20727.82s]  Much more than usual, show.
[20728.38s -> 20730.86s]  Apparently, I'm having trouble talking.
[20730.86s -> 20732.50s]  I need to get some protein.
[20733.54s -> 20735.14s]  Yeah, I mean, this game is really fun.
[20737.19s -> 20739.51s]  Did I get a clean 100 kilometers?
[20739.51s -> 20742.52s]  I don't have...
[20742.52s -> 20744.04s]  I don't have to open this game ever again.
[20744.04s -> 20750.23s]  Holy shit.
[20750.95s -> 20752.36s]  All right, let's do the credits.
[20752.36s -> 20753.16s]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[20753.16s -> 20754.20s]  I'll see you guys on...
[20754.20s -> 20754.92s]  I don't know.
[20754.92s -> 20757.11s]  Tomorrow, I'll be on Kitboga.
[20757.11s -> 20760.84s]  And then maybe Saturday or Monday?
[20760.84s -> 20761.88s]  We'll see how it goes.
[20761.88s -> 20763.64s]  Keep an eye on the sus over the next couple of days.
[20763.64s -> 20766.04s]  Let's do the credits, though.
[20766.04s -> 20772.73s]  Here they go.
[20772.73s -> 20776.92s]  Load them up in alphabetical order.
[20776.92s -> 20779.30s]  These are all the subs today.
[20779.30s -> 20780.98s]  For those of you that don't know,
[20780.98s -> 20784.55s]  if you're new to the channel, you might be.
[20784.55s -> 20791.13s]  I do not read subs or most bit messages, really, at all during the stream.
[20791.13s -> 20794.15s]  I used to do all the bits at the end of a stream,
[20794.15s -> 20796.92s]  but since I had some medical problems recently,
[20796.92s -> 20800.28s]  I've canned that indefinitely and probably permanently.
[20800.28s -> 20805.29s]  So a six-hour stream is a six-hour stream.
[20805.37s -> 20808.01s]  A six-hour stream does not turn into a six-hour stream,
[20808.01s -> 20820.70s]  and then an hour and a half post stream, if I need to get up.
[20820.70s -> 20821.82s]  I do appreciate it, nonetheless.
[20821.82s -> 20823.18s]  This channel gets a ton of support,
[20823.18s -> 20826.82s]  and I still can't believe this many people care.
[20826.82s -> 20828.42s]  Seeing the amount of names that just pop up, it's...
[20830.41s -> 20832.01s]  It can be overwhelming sometimes.
[20832.01s -> 20835.05s]  So thanks a lot, everybody.
[20835.05s -> 20837.90s]  Don't change your raid commit.
[20837.90s -> 20838.38s]  No, I...
[20838.38s -> 20839.66s]  We're raiding box box.
[20849.37s -> 20849.69s]  Birthday?
[20849.69s -> 20850.81s]  Well, we'll say happy birthday.
[20850.81s -> 20852.25s]  Just say happy birthday to the...
[20852.25s -> 20853.61s]  Like, next week when we raid them.
[20853.61s -> 20860.92s]  You can do a belated happy birthday for a week later.
[20860.92s -> 20864.62s]  Within seven days, a belated birthday,
[20865.43s -> 20865.91s]  that's a happy...
[20865.91s -> 20877.18s]  That works.
[20877.18s -> 20879.82s]  That's a terrible friend.
[20879.82s -> 20882.62s]  Look, you can't keep track of every single person's birthday.
[20882.62s -> 20886.71s]  So what ends up happening is one of your friends will have a birthday,
[20886.71s -> 20887.27s]  and you'll go,
[20887.91s -> 20888.87s]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[20888.87s -> 20889.43s]  I knew it was...
[20889.43s -> 20891.35s]  I knew it was in September, but...
[20891.35s -> 20891.91s]  No, it's all right.
[20891.91s -> 20893.11s]  It's been like four or five days.
[20893.11s -> 20893.83s]  It's okay.
[20893.83s -> 20897.34s]  Okay, now if like November rolls around and somebody said,
[20897.34s -> 20898.78s]  Hey, happy birthday, Jeremy.
[20899.34s -> 20901.58s]  I'd be like, all right, what the fuck are you doing?
[20901.58s -> 20903.02s]  It's unnecessary, man.
[20903.02s -> 20908.54s]  You might as well just say Merry Christmas, too, at that point.
[20908.54s -> 20923.00s]  Boxbox has a follower-only mode for 30 minutes.
[20923.00s -> 20923.64s]  That's perfect.
[20929.14s -> 20930.26s]  Here comes the rain!
[20938.36s -> 20940.71s]  That's kind of funny.
[20940.71s -> 20941.35s]  I committed...
[20941.35s -> 20941.75s]  I...
[20941.75s -> 20943.59s]  Look, you can't be like, let's raid this person,
[20943.59s -> 20944.95s]  and then like 10 minutes later be like,
[20944.95s -> 20945.67s]  Just kidding.
[20945.67s -> 20946.39s]  Fuck that.
[20946.39s -> 20948.55s]  No, you make a commitment, you do it.
[20948.55s -> 20955.78s]  I'll see you guys on...
[20957.05s -> 20958.26s]  Maybe Saturday?
[20958.26s -> 20959.22s]  Maybe Monday?
[20959.22s -> 20959.70s]  Saturday?
[20959.70s -> 20960.02s]  Sunday?
[20960.02s -> 20960.34s]  I don't know.
[20960.34s -> 20962.07s]  You'll see.
[20962.07s -> 20963.48s]  Thanks for watching.
[20963.48s -> 20968.15s]  Take care and go say hello to Boxbox on our behalf.
[20968.15s -> 20969.96s]  Like it.
