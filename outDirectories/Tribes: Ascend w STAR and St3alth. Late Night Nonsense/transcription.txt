[0.31s -> 12.25s]  I feel like our team is going to lose, so I'm just going to spend all my time coming after you.
[12.25s -> 14.25s]  That's okay.
[14.25s -> 16.25s]  Oh, I can see you. I just saw you.
[16.25s -> 18.25s]  I don't see you.
[18.25s -> 20.25s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[20.25s -> 27.25s]  Jerma here with a Tribes Ascent gameplay commentary, and this is going to be a live commentary.
[27.25s -> 31.25s]  This was taken from Ster's livestream last night.
[31.25s -> 36.62s]  We did this at like, God, maybe 3 or 4 in the morning is when this all actually ended.
[36.62s -> 38.62s]  So it went pretty late. It was very fun.
[38.62s -> 45.92s]  And I wanted to cut up the last maybe 15, 20 minutes of the stream, and that is what you're watching right now.
[45.92s -> 49.42s]  And again, playing with Ster.
[49.42s -> 56.42s]  His link will be in the description as well as MLC Stealth, but you guys already know Stealth, so I don't have to do an introduction for Stealth.
[56.42s -> 58.42s]  You probably know who Ster is too. What am I talking about?
[58.42s -> 62.42s]  But yeah, they will be in the description. Go check them out. They are really cool dudes.
[62.42s -> 69.42s]  But this video, this is a not so much a gameplay video as it is a me running from my life video,
[69.42s -> 73.42s]  because Ster is really good at this game and I'm not so good.
[73.42s -> 78.42s]  So it's me pretty much just running away from Ster and him trying to melee me to death.
[78.42s -> 80.42s]  So it's pretty entertaining.
[80.42s -> 82.42s]  But I'll let the live commentary kick in, guys, now.
[82.42s -> 85.42s]  So I will see you all next time.
[85.42s -> 87.42s]  Take care, everybody.
[88.42s -> 90.72s]  I'll do the double team.
[90.72s -> 93.02s]  I'll just smash you in the face.
[93.02s -> 95.78s]  Where are you?
[95.78s -> 98.53s]  I gotta shoot you. You have a YouTube channel.
[98.53s -> 106.66s]  Oh, I keep missing this guy.
[106.66s -> 109.66s]  Now he's dead.
[109.66s -> 111.66s]  Where are you at, Shazbot?
[111.66s -> 114.03s]  Shazbot?
[114.03s -> 117.62s]  Shazbot, Shazbot, Shazbot.
[117.62s -> 119.62s]  No, I just heard noise. It was this guy.
[119.62s -> 123.07s]  It was this slippery snake.
[123.07s -> 126.64s]  Oh.
[126.64s -> 129.64s]  I missed so much with this gun tonight. Oh my god.
[129.64s -> 133.52s]  I keep getting scared that you are right here somewhere.
[133.52s -> 136.70s]  For one of these times, I will be.
[136.70s -> 139.32s]  Help that this guy is teleporting.
[139.32s -> 144.93s]  Mike, go over there. I dare you. You're gonna get hit by that grenade.
[144.93s -> 147.49s]  Go over there.
[147.49s -> 149.49s]  Like where I just threw a grenade.
[149.49s -> 153.37s]  There's a lot of over-there's. I don't know where you guys are going.
[153.37s -> 155.67s]  I'm very, very, very confused.
[155.67s -> 158.55s]  Undo it.
[158.55s -> 161.50s]  Unconfuse yourself.
[161.50s -> 164.89s]  Whoa, whoa, what was that?
[164.89s -> 168.02s]  Die!
[168.02s -> 170.02s]  Were you just having a sniper rifle at me?
[170.02s -> 174.02s]  Oh, get blue plate mailed. Whatever it's called.
[176.33s -> 178.33s]  Oh, a knife.
[178.33s -> 180.33s]  Is this like medieval times?
[180.33s -> 182.33s]  Plate mail.
[182.33s -> 184.33s]  Blue plate special mail.
[184.33s -> 187.95s]  It's very special. My blacksmith made it this morning.
[188.95s -> 193.50s]  Oh, come on.
[193.50s -> 200.39s]  Oh yeah, eat grenade.
[200.39s -> 202.39s]  Maybe if I'm like really unpredictable.
[202.39s -> 204.39s]  I can't like be predicted.
[204.39s -> 206.39s]  Oh, is that the definition of that?
[206.39s -> 208.39s]  I'm over here.
[208.39s -> 210.39s]  If I'm like really unpredictable, I can't be predicted.
[210.39s -> 214.28s]  Come on. Come here.
[214.28s -> 216.28s]  No, god damn it.
[216.28s -> 220.62s]  Oh.
[220.62s -> 225.29s]  Humiliation.
[225.29s -> 227.29s]  Oh, you are so lucky that
[227.29s -> 229.29s]  things didn't go my way.
[229.29s -> 231.29s]  This guy.
[231.29s -> 233.29s]  You're gonna walk right into that man and it's gonna be your...
[233.29s -> 235.98s]  your demise.
[235.98s -> 237.98s]  How did that hit me? I don't understand.
[237.98s -> 239.98s]  So is there an item in this game that when you hit somebody
[239.98s -> 241.98s]  it plays like music?
[241.98s -> 243.98s]  What?
[243.98s -> 245.98s]  Seriously, I just got hit by a grenade and it was like
[247.98s -> 249.98s]  I swear.
[249.98s -> 251.98s]  I promise.
[253.98s -> 257.11s]  No, I refuse.
[257.11s -> 259.42s]  No. No, this cannot happen again.
[259.42s -> 262.74s]  Not a second time.
[262.74s -> 266.07s]  Grenade.
[266.07s -> 268.07s]  Fine. Fine. You die a normal death.
[270.82s -> 272.82s]  Oh god.
[272.82s -> 274.82s]  I got an assist.
[274.82s -> 279.69s]  I got destroyed.
[279.69s -> 282.06s]  I got the assist. What do you know?
[282.06s -> 284.06s]  There is a blacksmith. See, there's the anvil right there.
[284.06s -> 287.56s]  See it?
[287.56s -> 289.56s]  What's this like a rhino? Oh, it's a tank.
[289.56s -> 293.51s]  I thought that was an animal.
[297.42s -> 300.23s]  What is this guy doing?
[300.23s -> 304.01s]  I want to ride the rhino.
[304.01s -> 308.30s]  It'll be fun.
[308.30s -> 312.46s]  I want a vehicle.
[312.46s -> 314.46s]  Then I'll be the coolest guy in school.
[314.46s -> 316.46s]  There's like circles on the ground.
[316.46s -> 318.46s]  And on the thing on the circle.
[321.46s -> 325.37s]  Hey, vehicle.
[325.37s -> 327.37s]  Alright, I'm going to go look for it right now.
[327.37s -> 331.02s]  Hope you weren't lying to me.
[333.45s -> 340.04s]  I have to kill that guy.
[340.04s -> 342.41s]  Oh no.
[342.41s -> 347.14s]  It's MLC.
[347.14s -> 349.51s]  How do you pronounce that?
[349.51s -> 351.51s]  MLC. What are you talking about?
[351.51s -> 354.90s]  They're just letters.
[354.90s -> 356.90s]  They're just letters.
[356.90s -> 358.90s]  No, it's actually milk.
[358.90s -> 361.78s]  Germa, why do you have so many people like AFK back here?
[363.78s -> 365.78s]  Because this team is fun.
[369.05s -> 372.25s]  So, where's that Germa guy?
[372.25s -> 374.25s]  I see him. He's way on the other side of the map though.
[374.25s -> 376.25s]  He is going to get punched.
[376.25s -> 378.25s]  Wall hacks.
[378.25s -> 381.13s]  Let's see where I am.
[381.13s -> 383.13s]  Moto crossing for extra points.
[383.13s -> 385.13s]  Is that true? Alright.
[385.13s -> 387.13s]  That's not a thing, is it?
[387.13s -> 389.82s]  We're going to catch you.
[389.82s -> 391.82s]  Oh, I got you.
[391.82s -> 393.82s]  I got you.
[393.82s -> 395.82s]  Your teammate just walked by and was like
[395.82s -> 397.82s]  He wanted nothing to do with that.
[397.82s -> 399.82s]  Yeah, why? That was weird.
[399.82s -> 401.82s]  Like, oh, you two can have your fun. Bye.
[401.82s -> 403.82s]  Yeah, you're just punching each other.
[403.82s -> 406.57s]  They really need a weapon in this game.
[406.57s -> 408.57s]  That's like the sandwich for Heavy.
[408.57s -> 410.57s]  Where you can just walk around and everyone will understand you're stupid.
[412.57s -> 414.57s]  Wait, what?
[414.57s -> 417.13s]  He just walked...
[417.13s -> 425.13s]  Oh no, there he is again.
[425.13s -> 427.13s]  I'm shooting behind me.
[427.13s -> 430.14s]  I can't believe I missed.
[430.14s -> 432.14s]  Some brute killed me.
[432.14s -> 434.14s]  Some brutish guy killed me.
[434.14s -> 436.14s]  Oh, hi.
[436.14s -> 438.14s]  Okay, so where's your Germa?
[438.14s -> 440.14s]  Here's some more like
[440.14s -> 442.14s]  noise grenades.
[442.14s -> 444.14s]  I just ranked up.
[444.14s -> 446.14s]  You're doing good, right?
[446.14s -> 448.14s]  Seriously, listen.
[448.14s -> 450.14s]  I'm like, listen, you guys can't even hear it.
[450.14s -> 452.14s]  I threw two grenades at you, Germa.
[452.14s -> 454.14s]  See, I'm going to make a video
[454.14s -> 456.14s]  of this and I'm going to turn that up
[456.14s -> 458.14s]  so everyone can hear it.
[458.14s -> 460.14s]  I want people to know that that's music plays.
[460.14s -> 462.14s]  It's like elevator music.
[462.14s -> 464.14s]  When you do what?
[464.14s -> 466.14s]  But by that noise grenade.
[466.14s -> 468.14s]  Impact Nitron?
[468.14s -> 470.14s]  It's like an ear ringing noise.
[470.14s -> 472.14s]  Every time I...
[472.14s -> 474.14s]  Or maybe you're talking about fractals because that's
[474.14s -> 477.34s]  totally a disco party.
[477.34s -> 479.34s]  Fractals.
[479.34s -> 482.09s]  So this one doesn't go to 300.
[482.09s -> 484.09s]  It depends on the amount of points there actually are.
[484.09s -> 486.09s]  Sorry.
[486.09s -> 488.09s]  How many times am I going to have to hit you?
[488.09s -> 490.09s]  What is no joy?
[490.09s -> 492.26s]  When you killed someone who was on a streak.
[492.26s -> 494.26s]  Oh, cool.
[494.26s -> 497.40s]  I don't know.
[497.40s -> 501.82s]  Wait, where'd you just go?
[501.82s -> 503.82s]  No, I'm not falling for this one.
[503.82s -> 505.82s]  Who are you talking to?
[505.82s -> 509.14s]  You're a freaking infiltrator.
[509.14s -> 511.90s]  Where's your health?
[511.90s -> 513.90s]  How'd you get the health back?
[513.90s -> 516.76s]  I don't know.
[516.76s -> 518.76s]  I'm running. I'm getting out of here.
[518.76s -> 520.76s]  The slide.
[520.76s -> 523.45s]  You're joking. You can't run.
[523.45s -> 525.45s]  Over here.
[525.45s -> 528.26s]  Get away from me.
[528.26s -> 530.26s]  Grenades.
[530.26s -> 533.46s]  I'm coming in from the top.
[533.46s -> 536.02s]  Oh my god.
[536.02s -> 538.02s]  It said I suicided.
[538.02s -> 540.90s]  Hold on.
[540.90s -> 542.90s]  Did I throw the grenade at you and then walk over
[542.90s -> 544.90s]  on my own grenade? I think that's really what happened.
[544.90s -> 547.08s]  What a smart person I am.
[547.08s -> 551.43s]  Hey.
[551.43s -> 553.43s]  We did it.
[553.43s -> 555.86s]  Hey, good game. Shazbot, everyone.
[555.86s -> 558.87s]  No, I was 12 and 14.
[558.87s -> 560.87s]  My goodness.
[560.87s -> 564.46s]  I'm 18 and 11.
[564.46s -> 566.63s]  Unlock's available.
[566.63s -> 570.79s]  What am I unlocking?
[570.79s -> 573.46s]  Should I unlock
[573.46s -> 576.22s]  the doombringer or the
[576.22s -> 579.29s]  infiltrator?
[579.29s -> 581.46s]  You should get a weapon for a class you already have.
[581.46s -> 583.70s]  Oh, but it's so...
[583.70s -> 585.70s]  Don't get doombringer. Don't do it.
[585.70s -> 587.94s]  Oh, okay. Fine.
[587.94s -> 589.94s]  Unless you like standing around doing
[589.94s -> 591.94s]  nothing.
[591.94s -> 593.94s]  Well, I am pretty much a slug in this game.
[593.94s -> 595.94s]  You should probably go doombringer then.
[595.94s -> 598.50s]  You get like a minigun.
