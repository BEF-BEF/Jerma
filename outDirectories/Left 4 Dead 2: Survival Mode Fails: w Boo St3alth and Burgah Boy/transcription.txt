[0.31s -> 12.91s]  Dark Carnival, you must be this tall to die.
[12.91s -> 14.91s]  Oh yeah, baby!
[14.91s -> 22.91s]  Obviously, you can see we're in here with Boo, Burger Boy, of course, MLC Stealth, who is freaking out with a glitch.
[22.91s -> 29.34s]  This is our survival, so we're just jumping right into this here. I have no idea if we're gonna do this or not.
[29.34s -> 32.34s]  Boo, are you gonna throw that firearm on the ground?
[32.34s -> 34.34s]  This is a strategy.
[34.34s -> 38.34s]  I'm saying we climb up on this here thing over here.
[38.34s -> 41.34s]  Boo, toss down your ammo and go get a health kit.
[41.34s -> 46.65s]  Yeah, make sure you have health and pills and boom-a-bile and puke and pee.
[46.65s -> 48.65s]  Ooh, puke.
[48.65s -> 49.65s]  I love puke.
[49.65s -> 54.26s]  Alright, nobody pick up the grenade launcher, that's gonna be bad.
[54.26s -> 56.26s]  Meet Burger.
[56.26s -> 58.82s]  Hello, everyone.
[59.82s -> 62.99s]  I was like reading that.
[62.99s -> 64.99s]  Hello, everyone.
[64.99s -> 68.42s]  I was reading that sign that says Meet Burger.
[68.42s -> 71.42s]  Yeah, this is like the first time Burger Boy's been in a video, I think.
[71.42s -> 73.42s]  I'm trying to jump on top of the corn dogs.
[73.42s -> 75.42s]  Alright, does that mean you're ready? Okay, cool.
[75.42s -> 77.42s]  Do we have the little gasket? Oh, never mind.
[77.42s -> 79.42s]  Everyone hang out up here.
[79.42s -> 81.66s]  Where did the zombies come from?
[81.66s -> 83.66s]  Oh, jockey gods.
[83.66s -> 85.66s]  Oh god, that was, oh my god.
[85.66s -> 87.66s]  Spitter, spitter across the way.
[87.66s -> 88.66s]  We're already like dead.
[88.66s -> 89.66s]  No, we're not.
[89.66s -> 91.66s]  Yeah, I've already fallen off.
[91.66s -> 94.50s]  It's alright.
[94.50s -> 95.50s]  I'm like on fire.
[95.50s -> 97.50s]  We've just got four minutes, that's it.
[97.50s -> 100.96s]  Yeah, I'm saving that.
[100.96s -> 102.96s]  I'm coming back up.
[102.96s -> 103.96s]  I'm up.
[103.96s -> 105.96s]  There's pills up here, so heal up and grab some pills.
[105.96s -> 108.52s]  Boom-a-bile.
[108.52s -> 115.64s]  Oh, we just need to, if we survive four minutes, we're super MLG pros.
[115.64s -> 116.64s]  Oh my god.
[116.64s -> 117.64s]  I got you, I got you.
[117.64s -> 118.64s]  I don't like this.
[118.64s -> 120.14s]  Get off of my bread.
[120.14s -> 121.14s]  Oh, charge.
[121.14s -> 122.14s]  Get out of here.
[122.14s -> 123.38s]  Oh, that didn't take long.
[123.38s -> 125.38s]  You're almost dead.
[125.38s -> 127.94s]  You need to heal, bro.
[127.94s -> 130.33s]  Burning sensation.
[130.33s -> 132.33s]  Look at me, just achievements all around.
[132.33s -> 135.33s]  Oh, you're getting a bunch of achievements right now?
[135.33s -> 137.33s]  By all around, I mean one.
[137.33s -> 138.33s]  Whoa.
[138.33s -> 140.63s]  That just destroyed.
[140.63s -> 141.63s]  Yeah, we gotta be careful of the spitters, man.
[141.63s -> 144.63s]  The spitter's gonna spit up here and we're gonna be all done.
[144.63s -> 146.63s]  Oh, you mean like that, except he missed.
[146.63s -> 149.63s]  Oh my god, I was just unloading on your back, dude.
[149.63s -> 150.63s]  I'm sorry.
[150.63s -> 151.63s]  Tank.
[151.63s -> 152.63s]  Oh, he's throwing a rock.
[152.63s -> 153.63s]  Tank, where is he?
[153.63s -> 154.63s]  Ow.
[154.63s -> 155.63s]  Just unload on him.
[155.63s -> 156.63s]  He has to climb up here.
[156.63s -> 157.63s]  He has to climb up here.
[157.63s -> 158.87s]  Just destroy him.
[158.87s -> 159.87s]  All right, get off.
[159.87s -> 160.87s]  Oh, man.
[160.87s -> 161.87s]  It doesn't have to take too long, does it?
[161.87s -> 162.87s]  Smack out.
[162.87s -> 163.87s]  There's a hunter around too.
[163.87s -> 165.11s]  Be careful.
[165.11s -> 166.11s]  He's going down.
[166.11s -> 167.11s]  He's down.
[167.11s -> 168.11s]  Tank dead.
[168.11s -> 169.11s]  Tank dead.
[169.11s -> 170.11s]  Oh, god.
[170.11s -> 171.11s]  Get this.
[171.11s -> 172.11s]  Oh, I got a jockey on me.
[172.11s -> 173.11s]  Oh, and a charger, too.
[173.11s -> 174.54s]  Are you kidding me?
[174.54s -> 175.54s]  I'm over here, screwed.
[175.54s -> 176.54s]  Oh, shit.
[176.54s -> 177.54s]  I'm trying to get to you.
[177.54s -> 178.54s]  Oh, you got boom too.
[178.54s -> 179.54s]  Boomer and a charger.
[179.54s -> 182.19s]  Oh, god.
[182.19s -> 183.19s]  Oh, god.
[183.19s -> 186.01s]  Take your pills if you have them.
[186.01s -> 188.53s]  Yeah, good throw.
[188.53s -> 189.53s]  Good throw.
[189.53s -> 190.53s]  Good throw.
[190.53s -> 191.53s]  Good toss.
[191.53s -> 192.53s]  Are you dead?
[192.53s -> 193.53s]  I'm lying down right here on the ground.
[193.53s -> 198.14s]  Oh, come on, Burger Boy.
[198.14s -> 199.14s]  Tank again.
[199.14s -> 200.14s]  Tank.
[200.14s -> 201.14s]  Oh, my god.
[201.14s -> 205.13s]  Wow.
[205.13s -> 206.13s]  I'm trying to save you, German.
[206.13s -> 211.37s]  Dude, you just got flushed so far on my screen.
[211.37s -> 212.37s]  I'll get him.
[212.37s -> 213.37s]  Don't worry.
[213.37s -> 214.37s]  He's going down.
[214.37s -> 216.37s]  Burger Boy, you are like the master of this game.
[216.37s -> 218.25s]  All right, come on.
[218.25s -> 219.25s]  Come on.
[219.25s -> 220.25s]  I'll be the bait.
[220.25s -> 221.25s]  I'm going down.
[221.25s -> 222.55s]  I'm dead.
[222.55s -> 223.55s]  I'm dead.
[223.55s -> 224.55s]  Another minute and a half.
[227.01s -> 232.01s]  Oh, if anybody can get rid of that tank and somebody picks up the defibs.
[232.01s -> 234.01s]  Oh, dear lord.
[234.01s -> 237.53s]  Oh, Burger Boy.
[237.53s -> 238.83s]  I think I got him.
[238.83s -> 239.83s]  Oh, boo.
[239.83s -> 240.83s]  You get full health.
[240.83s -> 242.83s]  Boo, I'm like healing and stuff.
[242.83s -> 243.83s]  I am so dead.
[243.83s -> 244.83s]  His tank's dead.
[244.83s -> 245.83s]  He's quieting down a little bit.
[245.83s -> 247.83s]  Hey, revive me, ML.
[247.83s -> 248.83s]  ML.
[248.83s -> 250.83s]  Oh, my charger.
[250.83s -> 252.07s]  Oh, Hunter.
[252.07s -> 254.07s]  Yeah, that's the end of me.
[254.07s -> 255.07s]  No, no, no, no.
[255.07s -> 256.44s]  Stealth, it's up to you.
[256.44s -> 257.44s]  Oh, you got Burger Boy.
[257.44s -> 258.44s]  Oh, you got Burger Boy.
[258.44s -> 260.38s]  Nice.
[260.38s -> 261.38s]  Burger Boy got a Hunter on him.
[261.38s -> 262.38s]  And a Spitter right there.
[262.38s -> 263.38s]  Spitter right behind you guys.
[263.38s -> 264.94s]  Tank.
[264.94s -> 265.94s]  Oh, dear.
[265.94s -> 268.72s]  Deary, deary me.
[268.72s -> 269.72s]  Oh, come on.
[269.72s -> 271.90s]  I'm coming in all kinds of spit here.
[271.90s -> 273.90s]  Do some crazy techniques.
[273.90s -> 274.90s]  Four minutes.
[274.90s -> 275.90s]  How?
[275.90s -> 276.90s]  Oh, man.
[276.90s -> 277.90s]  Oh, Stealth.
[277.90s -> 278.90s]  Oh, there's a Hunter coming.
[278.90s -> 279.90s]  Run around in circles.
[279.90s -> 281.58s]  All right.
[281.58s -> 282.58s]  All right.
[282.58s -> 283.58s]  Good first attempt.
[283.58s -> 284.58s]  We almost made it to four minutes.
[284.58s -> 285.58s]  Charger's coming for you.
[285.58s -> 286.58s]  Oh.
[286.58s -> 287.58s]  That's it.
[287.58s -> 288.58s]  That's all she wrote.
[288.58s -> 289.58s]  Three and a half.
[289.58s -> 290.58s]  God damn it.
[290.58s -> 291.58s]  That was the best time.
[291.58s -> 295.13s]  So.
[295.13s -> 296.13s]  I'm terrified.
[296.13s -> 297.13s]  Me too.
[297.13s -> 298.13s]  Just hang in that corner.
[298.13s -> 299.13s]  There's a Jaguar right behind us.
[299.13s -> 300.13s]  There's a Goldberg to our left right here, too.
[300.13s -> 301.13s]  Oh, God.
[301.13s -> 302.13s]  Smoker hasn't...
[302.13s -> 303.13s]  Oh, never mind.
[303.13s -> 304.13s]  It failed.
[304.13s -> 305.13s]  All right.
[305.13s -> 306.13s]  Just get in this corner.
[306.13s -> 307.13s]  Oh, man.
[307.13s -> 308.13s]  I'm already stung.
[308.13s -> 309.13s]  You're good.
[309.13s -> 310.62s]  You're good.
[310.62s -> 311.62s]  You're good.
[311.62s -> 312.62s]  Yes.
[312.62s -> 314.06s]  All right.
[314.06s -> 315.06s]  Hop in this corner.
[315.06s -> 316.06s]  This is it.
[316.06s -> 317.06s]  When a tank comes, we can...
[317.06s -> 320.86s]  Oh, come on.
[320.86s -> 321.86s]  We can deal with it.
[321.86s -> 322.86s]  Oh, yeah.
[322.86s -> 323.86s]  I'm tanking my bile.
[323.86s -> 324.86s]  Yeah.
[324.86s -> 325.86s]  When a tank comes, we can...
[325.86s -> 326.86s]  That's better.
[326.86s -> 327.86s]  Smoker right there.
[327.86s -> 328.86s]  Smoker straight ahead.
[328.86s -> 329.86s]  Oh.
[329.86s -> 330.86s]  And an idiot that just fell.
[330.86s -> 332.03s]  All right.
[332.03s -> 333.03s]  Look at this.
[333.03s -> 334.03s]  Spitter up top on the...
[334.03s -> 335.03s]  Oh, that Spitter's gonna get us.
[335.03s -> 336.03s]  No, she's not.
[336.03s -> 337.03s]  She's too stupid.
[337.03s -> 338.03s]  Jock's coming to our left.
[338.03s -> 339.03s]  Straight ahead.
[339.03s -> 340.03s]  Tank.
[340.03s -> 341.03s]  All right.
[341.03s -> 342.03s]  This is where we start to move around.
[342.03s -> 343.27s]  Boom-a-bile.
[343.27s -> 344.27s]  I'm throwing it the other way.
[344.27s -> 345.27s]  Throw it on him.
[345.27s -> 346.27s]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[346.27s -> 347.27s]  Hey, Hunter.
[347.27s -> 348.27s]  Heads up.
[348.27s -> 349.27s]  It's all right.
[349.27s -> 350.27s]  Just focus on the tank.
[350.27s -> 351.27s]  Spitter.
[353.54s -> 354.54s]  Tank should be almost dead.
[354.54s -> 355.71s]  Hunter's dead.
[355.71s -> 356.71s]  Run, Jerma.
[356.71s -> 358.98s]  Tank's dead.
[358.98s -> 359.98s]  Tank's dead.
[359.98s -> 362.82s]  Regroup.
[362.82s -> 363.82s]  Tank's dead.
[363.82s -> 364.82s]  Hey, Jocky.
[364.82s -> 365.82s]  Oh, watch out for the Jocko.
[365.82s -> 366.82s]  Jocker.
[366.82s -> 368.95s]  Whatever.
[368.95s -> 369.95s]  All right.
[369.95s -> 370.95s]  Back in the corner.
[370.95s -> 372.38s]  Back in the corner.
[372.38s -> 373.94s]  Oh, is it...
[373.94s -> 375.50s]  Oh, I've been Jocky.
[375.50s -> 376.50s]  Jocky.
[376.50s -> 377.50s]  There's somebody back here.
[377.50s -> 378.50s]  Thanks.
[378.50s -> 379.50s]  All right.
[379.50s -> 380.50s]  Good.
[380.50s -> 381.50s]  Good.
[381.50s -> 382.50s]  Good.
[382.50s -> 383.50s]  All right.
[383.50s -> 384.50s]  This is the best we've done so far.
[384.50s -> 387.68s]  No one's running around aimlessly in circles dying.
[387.68s -> 388.68s]  Just about out of ammo, though.
[388.68s -> 392.11s]  Yeah, we're going to have to make a team ammo run in a second here.
[392.11s -> 393.11s]  You guys want to do it?
[393.11s -> 395.18s]  After the next tank.
[395.18s -> 396.18s]  Get the ammo.
[396.18s -> 397.18s]  No, actually, yeah.
[397.18s -> 398.18s]  Where's the ammo?
[398.18s -> 399.18s]  Let's just go as a team.
[399.18s -> 400.18s]  I just need the shotgun right here.
[400.18s -> 401.18s]  I'll smoke right here.
[401.18s -> 402.18s]  Spitter.
[402.18s -> 403.18s]  Spitter, actually.
[403.18s -> 404.18s]  All right.
[404.18s -> 405.18s]  Go back in the corner.
[405.18s -> 406.18s]  Back in the corner.
[406.18s -> 407.81s]  Buma.
[407.81s -> 408.81s]  Back in that good old corner.
[408.81s -> 410.30s]  Hunter.
[410.30s -> 411.30s]  Oh, God.
[411.30s -> 412.67s]  He got right on me.
[412.67s -> 413.67s]  There's a tank coming.
[413.67s -> 415.30s]  Oh, dear Lord.
[415.30s -> 416.30s]  Right next to us.
[416.30s -> 417.30s]  Right behind us.
[417.30s -> 418.30s]  He got behind us.
[418.30s -> 419.30s]  He climbed up behind us.
[419.30s -> 420.79s]  Holy shit.
[420.79s -> 421.79s]  He's right there.
[421.79s -> 423.97s]  I threw a Molotov on you guys.
[423.97s -> 424.97s]  I apologize.
[424.97s -> 425.97s]  It's okay.
[425.97s -> 426.97s]  Somebody want to watch my back for one second?
[426.97s -> 427.97s]  Oh, jeez.
[427.97s -> 428.97s]  Oh, I got chargers.
[428.97s -> 429.97s]  Watch my back for one second.
[429.97s -> 430.97s]  No, I'm going to go down.
[430.97s -> 431.97s]  I'm going to kill this charger.
[431.97s -> 432.97s]  Come on.
[432.97s -> 433.97s]  Come on.
[433.97s -> 434.97s]  I'm trying to get something.
[434.97s -> 435.97s]  I just can't believe I got that off.
[435.97s -> 437.40s]  Oh, a charger downed me.
[437.40s -> 438.40s]  Oh, come on.
[438.40s -> 439.40s]  The tank's right behind me.
[439.40s -> 440.40s]  I'm done.
[440.40s -> 441.40s]  Oh, my God.
[441.40s -> 442.40s]  This is over.
[442.40s -> 443.40s]  We were doing so good.
[443.40s -> 444.40s]  We have to do another.
[444.40s -> 445.40s]  We can't end it on that.
[445.40s -> 446.40s]  That was a good strategy.
[446.40s -> 447.40s]  No.
[447.40s -> 450.40s]  We didn't even make it to duh.
[451.40s -> 452.40s]  Oh, my God.
[452.40s -> 454.40s]  Like, where did that charger come from?
[454.40s -> 457.40s]  We just got our ass washed.
