[1.72s -> 10.20s]  Does anybody think I lost my mind? I don't know, there's a lot of question, but I'll
[10.20s -> 18.28s]  explain. So, is it weird that I've made a coffee, like I've got a coffee, and I drank
[18.28s -> 27.44s]  half of it. And I said, damn it, I really wish I had more coffee. So I have a water
[27.44s -> 35.20s]  here. And I said, you know, I could just turn that water into coffee. Like Jesus. I could,
[35.20s -> 40.70s]  I just poured it in to the coffee that's here, and just made another coffee. It's just a
[40.70s -> 48.15s]  coffee here now. So when I get to 50% again, I'm gonna add more and fill it up again. It's
[48.15s -> 62.04s]  gonna be it's gonna be infinite coffee. Let me see how it tastes. Pretty good. That's
[62.04s -> 69.24s]  the third time I've done it. So you can drink. Like I love coffee. But I could just make
[69.24s -> 74.12s]  a coffee and just dilute the fuck out of it. Over and over again. And it's like I drank
[74.12s -> 82.29s]  eight coffees, but I only drank one. This is actually a really good idea. And then it
[82.29s -> 88.66s]  would just become Dunkin Donuts. That's all the time I got here, folks. I'll see you next
[88.66s -> 109.77s]  week. We're gonna keep going with Dead Rising 2. If you didn't know. Off the record, I'm
[109.77s -> 116.65s]  having a lot of fun with it. We are at just about the halfway point. So gonna see what
[116.65s -> 125.32s]  happens gonna see if we can do it all in one stream. We'll see. I think we can do it. Hey
[125.32s -> 132.26s]  failing kidneys. Thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate that. So we'll we'll take
[132.26s -> 139.33s]  a little assessment of where we are at like the six to seven hour period. Right? Maybe
[139.33s -> 147.04s]  I'll just power through it. I've eaten. I came prepared. I ate a full salad with this
[147.04s -> 162.79s]  delicious Gorgonzola Gorgonzola dressing. Oh boy was it tasty. Oh, he ate a salad. Do
[162.79s -> 168.76s]  I want an award? No, I'm just saying like I ate a shitload of greens. So I'm gonna be
[168.76s -> 175.82s]  full for a while. I ate 1900 calories worth of grains. I'm done till tomorrow, right?
[175.82s -> 182.42s]  The you mad diet. I'm actually I'm liking the you mad diet. I get to eat once and eat
[182.42s -> 196.24s]  like 1900 calories worth of kale. You're just eating grass. Not true. All right, let's get
[197.24s -> 209.23s]  Let's move over to the game. It's not called you mad. Yes, it is. It's it. Yes, it's oh,
[209.23s -> 222.45s]  yes, it's oh mad. But I changed my opinion. You mad chats mad. All right, let's go. It's
[222.45s -> 229.68s]  just paused. Time doesn't go when it's paused, right? Shouldn't. All right. Oh, let's refresh
[229.68s -> 242.19s]  some memories here. It does not. This is what I look like. This is what I sound like. Cool.
[244.72s -> 249.96s]  All right. So we have four to run for the money. I have one Zombricks slave to fashion.
[249.96s -> 255.29s]  This is right here. So let's get it done. Locate the woman in distress at the Fortune
[255.29s -> 260.08s]  City Hotel. We get time for how many how many cases are in four to just so we don't mess
[260.08s -> 271.95s]  it all up. Okay, for two, I got a long time to do for two. Once we do case five, though,
[271.95s -> 285.44s]  I got to get on that because I don't want to burn time. Let's move. It's saved. I got
[285.44s -> 293.08s]  my drink. I don't know why I have it. Can I give this to him? No, not going to get time
[293.08s -> 300.65s]  management today. Not going to be like last night. I meditated right before this stream started.
[300.65s -> 310.48s]  So I'm going to be way better than I was yesterday. Why am I seeing a million cappers?
[313.21s -> 331.92s]  Is that a meditation joke? Well, those men. Okay. He ate greens. Andy Frank is lying on
[332.40s -> 340.94s]  the test. How many? This is a lot of shit going on here. How many cases are here?
[343.44s -> 352.08s]  How many? Look at all these scoops. There's too many. This is this is right in my level
[352.08s -> 357.44s]  range. It's yellow. You know, I feel like these are going to turn blue and I don't really want
[357.44s -> 372.20s]  to do them. Come on. Come on. I'm waiting for it. Give it to me. Nothing. I'm surprised.
[373.80s -> 380.88s]  Holy shit. Some of you Wow. I was waiting for like a wave of hatred. Not really that much.
[382.04s -> 386.01s]  And true. That's really interesting. Actually, I got to write that one down.
[386.65s -> 393.12s]  Like that reaction. That was a World of Warcraft reference. And that's always a guaranteed like
[393.12s -> 406.11s]  German shut the fuck up minus two. That's interesting. Bargaining. Yeah, I know what
[406.11s -> 413.66s]  magazines do. I should have picked this up beforehand. Hey, hey, hey, get away. I'm looking
[413.66s -> 421.93s]  at stuff. Just leave this thing here. I don't need it right now. Just put it down. No, no,

[429.45s -> 434.89s]  meditating right now. No. That's why meditation doesn't work when you play Dead Rising. I've got
[434.89s -> 441.37s]  to be like lit up like a Christmas tree. You know what I mean? I can't be slow and calm. I have to
[441.37s -> 457.61s]  be like freaking out. Wait, can you not break an ATM with a rake? Local man tries to break ATM with
[457.61s -> 472.99s]  a rake. Why can I not get into these? Can you? I don't know. Probably. I got lots of money. I
[472.99s -> 481.23s]  want that car though. I expect that's the longest I've ever gone without getting bit.
[483.42s -> 489.76s]  All right. Slave to fashion. What do I have for weapons? They're terrible. I have a shitty rake.

[642.72s -> 661.08s]  though. All right. Give me that broom. There you go. The drill sucks, but it's a panic weapon.

[705.63s -> 717.79s]  Put it on a boss? Does that actually work on a boss? No. Wow. Oh, well. Well, then we'll just
[717.79s -> 721.39s]  use it on random people. Let's just use it on like, I don't know, this guy. This person over here.

[783.31s -> 788.94s]  I'm gonna save it right in the middle just in case there's a nightmare scenario where I can't.
[789.82s -> 814.81s]  Why do I hear machine guns? Who has a machine gun here? Is this pre-recorded stream Tuesday? Yes.

[822.04s -> 830.89s]  stream for seven hours and I stream to myself for until eight o'clock this morning and then I render
[830.89s -> 843.64s]  it and upload it to Twitch and let it play as a rerun. That's what I do. I'm gonna keep this one

[906.46s -> 934.43s]  now? Why is the viscera cleanup detail guy going fucking crazy? Now I need healing. I need health.

[3126.59s -> 3137.95s]  is so long but it's okay we're going then now I'm doing it right now it's too I can't even do this
[3137.95s -> 3154.46s]  if it's like yellow can I get into this bathroom this is fucking bathroom but the bathroom's the
[3154.46s -> 3188.88s]  elevator the bathroom's in the elevator huh oh all right I can make it where even is this one
[3188.88s -> 3203.72s]  is it this one here is that where I'm going yeah there's a woman in the underground
[3205.82s -> 3217.39s]  it's what it's all of these locations it's all of them oh no that's not good we may have to go
[3217.39s -> 3222.99s]  back in time and a dude's four two before when it's halfway to like when I'm in one of my safe
[3222.99s -> 3249.92s]  zones climb over dude just do the cases as soon as you can well some of them you can
[3253.44s -> 3257.44s]  all right I have a checkpoint which is right here how the fuck am I going to be able to do all this
[3259.24s -> 3267.18s]  all the casino vaults all of them um how how am I going to do that I need the car the car is
[3267.18s -> 3281.61s]  like all the way over there wheelchair and it's gonna have to redo it we'll see how far I get
[3281.61s -> 3305.29s]  I got I've got some decent save points just reset now there's no way I'm doing this hold on of course
[3305.85s -> 3334.04s]  you're laying down fire across everything and I'm still gonna grab him no there's no way this is
[3334.04s -> 3358.70s]  happening oh man this is no way I have to come here first look at all this shit this is this is
[3358.70s -> 3375.68s]  like gonna take all day just kill me just kill me I gotta come here prepared with like weapons and
[3375.68s -> 3398.52s]  shit I mean oh it's it might be possible though don't give up yet did this motherfucker just eat
[3398.52s -> 3416.46s]  a whole pie yes I had to all right they're over here shit this is really long
[3420.43s -> 3442.73s]  I thought I had time I thought I had time to do all this okay well here they are where are you
[3453.20s -> 3464.67s]  they just didn't hear okay are you shitting me are you shitting me
[3467.08s -> 3485.95s]  I have to do this in three separate places dude what is it with zombie games forever there always
[3485.95s -> 3491.63s]  has to be assault rifle military people in these games I just want to play the zombie game it's
[3491.63s -> 3495.23s]  almost like they second guessed if the game was any fun fuck we're gonna add like segments where
[3495.23s -> 3507.96s]  they shoot at people with guns this happens in almost every zombie game so uh this is tricky
[3508.89s -> 3523.40s]  because the one 620 I think maybe it's gonna have to be the 621 this is
[3523.40s -> 3539.12s]  rare this is very far away how much time is in this one let's take a look I want oh this still
[3539.12s -> 3551.60s]  it's it's you two are here shit god damn it really and it's yellow all right I have to
[3552.40s -> 3561.29s]  dump these two and then go so I'm gonna that's not that far away I could I think it's possible
[3561.29s -> 3574.14s]  now here we go there should be enough time I'm gonna have to abandon all the other missions
[3574.78s -> 3586.56s]  we just have to dump them and go unlock the shortcut I didn't didn't I I did yeah I did
[3586.56s -> 3618.30s]  this is after the shortcut yeah I'm good shit and then I'm gonna have to go to the furthest one
[3618.30s -> 3631.66s]  away up and just try to not die fuck and here's the 20 grand and then I think this I think that
[3631.66s -> 3636.14s]  this is where I saved it I sort of gone to the first one because I remember I was like oh let
[3636.14s -> 3642.30s]  me make sure I have a timeline back here yeah so the other save point is this one's 10 minutes
[3642.86s -> 3659.69s]  faster because see watch this ready this one is the same exact timeline but I was like five
[3659.69s -> 3668.89s]  minutes faster so we're gonna do this one and remember the absolute like fuck face scenario
[3668.89s -> 3677.80s]  if this is impossible I've got take a look at this I've got two two is four hours ago look at
[3677.80s -> 3682.68s]  that that's why you never save over that keep that there that's why I did this I saved three
[3682.68s -> 3696.25s]  minutes so I need to go to this one this one here no all right so I'm gonna take the take the
[3696.25s -> 3705.15s]  shortcut and then go to this one and then try to make it all the way back I think that's correct
[3705.71s -> 3718.38s]  that's right I have such shitty weapons though I need to be able to kill two of them why not left
[3718.38s -> 3726.44s]  middle right because I think that's shorter I think if I go to the shortcut first do the one
[3726.44s -> 3737.68s]  right next to me yeah and then go in the shortcut and then okay so left shortcut middle right no left
[3737.68s -> 3751.66s]  shortcut right middle or left right middle I don't know I'm just gonna go for it so in that case
[3752.38s -> 3762.59s]  just do this one which is in here okay let's go do I have enough time to do this shit
[3764.52s -> 3786.89s]  I really hope so otherwise we have to rewind three hours here we go take your time take the time take
[3786.89s -> 3799.74s]  the time I have to get an assault rifle quick how many times do I have to shoot you before you die
[3801.60s -> 3809.16s]  get too much body armor just give me a break
[3834.94s -> 3852.03s]  I wanted to pick up the handbag creamer I want the creamer what is that a drill how do I stop
[3852.03s -> 3865.39s]  the drill okay there's one okay uh it's a lot of money right here good job on that frank but

[3878.91s -> 3894.38s]  other one too 27 and get rid of the handbag let's go good money it's not that much okay so now we're
[3894.38s -> 3902.68s]  gonna go just straight up just straight up or should I take the shortcut and go right help me

[3947.71s -> 3959.40s]  I came back for okay go all right did we decide on what was the better idea just go straight through
[3973.50s -> 3986.80s]  he hates bits what are you talking about I have to save it though all right did we decide
[3989.42s -> 3993.71s]  I can save it in there and take the shortcut and then come down that's what that's the play
[3994.35s -> 4005.61s]  that's the play no no but I have to save the game what if I get caught and die
[4007.64s -> 4016.52s]  what if I die I might die and then you're gonna hear loud noises I'm gonna be like I should have
[4016.52s -> 4020.28s]  saved it back here and I should have done this and I should have replaced the handbag with that
[4020.28s -> 4033.58s]  orange juice and I'm gonna be like I should have listened to my own intuition I should have listened
[4033.58s -> 4048.41s]  to myself you've already heard it before somebody's in trouble I don't have time

[5107.61s -> 5112.99s]  there's a restaurant right here somewhere where's the restaurant I mean this thing is a restaurant
[5113.71s -> 5121.87s]  here we are okay I should have enough time to like get some health I don't want to use any

[5267.32s -> 5280.43s]  spent too much time in the restaurant um so I have a question those of you that have played
[5280.43s -> 5287.79s]  this game like 30 times in a row and I know everything when I blow up this van is at the
[5287.79s -> 5305.42s]  end I just look at it fucking chat kill me just kill me kill me kill me is this still a drill that

[5390.14s -> 5400.73s]  uh I don't think I can go in the restaurant there's nothing wrong with starting the whole
[5400.73s -> 5405.60s]  game over yeah but I feel like I don't want to do I don't want to do like the whole game again
[5408.17s -> 5422.06s]  you know what I mean it's definitely possible if I have to oh absolutely yeah get three guns and
[5422.06s -> 5432.49s]  shoot the van let's try this side yeah but I need three guns okay this is actually not a bad spot

[24136.61s -> 24145.62s]  Forget it. Just goodbye
[24147.12s -> 24169.24s]  No reason to do any of this shotgun and the lawnmower. Let's see pole weapon air horn

[24175.31s -> 24180.93s]  Pegasus sticky bomb i'm gonna get that hell blade and get the filer. I know that
[24182.15s -> 24184.15s]  battery and sledgehammer
[24184.39s -> 24188.32s]  Okay, I can do that
[24188.32s -> 24190.32s]  Money hacker is a flashlight and a computer
[24191.04s -> 24193.72s]  knife gloves, right
[24193.72s -> 24196.28s]  That's a laser sword snowball cannon spike bat, right?
[24197.76s -> 24204.23s]  All right. Well, i'll make the shotgun a battery battery and lawnmower. I want to let me try this
[24208.36s -> 24212.12s]  It looks pretty good. This is can I hold it and I have to okay I can have it in my inventory
[24212.68s -> 24214.98s]  That's pretty huge
[24214.98s -> 24222.55s]  How does it work? I mean as slow as shit
[24226.21s -> 24232.08s]  Holy fuck
[24232.08s -> 24247.08s]  Well, i'm dead. I lost that much health just went into the maintenance room
[24248.20s -> 24253.40s]  And the whole game flooded in it's just you have a magnet. They just want to eat you you just
[24254.60s -> 24257.24s]  Fresh meat or whatever and now I have to do that again
[24258.68s -> 24266.68s]  Because I didn't close the door I was surrounded by people coughing in my face
[24267.40s -> 24269.48s]  They were just sneezing on me and stunning me
[24270.28s -> 24282.31s]  Just like in real life
[24282.64s -> 24286.00s]  And that happened remember when that happened. We're just gonna redo the same scenario
[24286.40s -> 24290.64s]  I don't play games differently the second time through we just do it the same way every time
[24291.76s -> 24293.76s]  That's just the way it happens
[24295.14s -> 24297.14s]  But wait a second

[24334.13s -> 24335.73s]  Can I pick it up?
[24335.73s -> 24348.21s]  No, there's no point with this. There's no point
[24348.61s -> 24350.61s]  There's no point. I can't even bring it with me
[24351.01s -> 24377.38s]  That would have been really useful. Yeah
[24377.38s -> 24388.21s]  Okay, do not have the same scenario play out twice
[24389.01s -> 24392.85s]  I know they call me Jeremy
[24393.65s -> 24395.09s]  Do it again
[24395.09s -> 24396.66s]  elbertson
[24396.66s -> 24402.42s]  Nothing changes. They call me german. Nothing fucking changes elbertson because I do the same mistakes every time
[24403.46s -> 24433.36s]  Okay battery sledgehammer done rock now. We've got that's pretty much what I still had before. I'm gonna pick the other shotgun
[24434.08s -> 24462.68s]  remember this
[24462.76s -> 24464.68s]  I went real far
[24464.68s -> 24471.60s]  I saw the hot dogs
[24471.60s -> 24473.60s]  No, I need that crusher

[24505.68s -> 24508.56s]  It's it doesn't do anything for me. It takes so long to detonate
[24509.28s -> 24517.44s]  the axe
[24517.44s -> 24520.39s]  And where's the sledgehammer over here?
[24532.16s -> 24533.36s]  battery
[24533.36s -> 24535.14s]  Where's the sledgehammer?
[24535.14s -> 24537.99s]  deeper in
[24537.99s -> 24540.87s]  That's not it, right? No, there it is
[24545.22s -> 24547.22s]  And there's orange juice and shit
[24557.60s -> 24559.60s]  Just let me take a second to look

[24562.29s -> 24563.81s]  I want
[24563.81s -> 24567.01s]  The what the fuck do I even put down this random blade?
[24567.65s -> 24572.05s]  Give me the other orange juice. I'm gonna put down a shotgun for the orange juice. It's more important. It is
[24576.53s -> 24583.64s]  All right, two heals
[24583.88s -> 24588.21s]  Drink one not yet. I don't need it a little soon
[24591.43s -> 24614.79s]  If there's if I see another orange juice, oh i'll i'll be drinking it eight ball
[24623.64s -> 24625.64s]  Oh, he's losing his mind. Okay
[24630.37s -> 24641.96s]  I see that walking out
[24643.32s -> 24646.07s]  You know that kills people
[24646.07s -> 24648.39s]  They always show people waking up like four hours later
[24648.71s -> 24653.27s]  You're dead if someone does that to you and you hit you in the temple. You're gonna you're dead. You're going to die
[24655.22s -> 24657.22s]  and if you don't wake up and
[24658.02s -> 24660.10s]  Your your your whole life is changed

[24690.84s -> 24694.12s]  Is he did he just what's he what why can he do this?
[24707.46s -> 24709.94s]  That's a long fuse that takes a long time
[24710.50s -> 24715.30s]  Do that again. I dare you
[24715.62s -> 24729.33s]  Where's it? I knew it was gonna happen. He shot me
[24730.13s -> 24751.78s]  I wonder if I should just run up there and just start fucking stabbing him. I'm going for it
[24764.84s -> 24767.24s]  Well, there are guns everywhere so maybe that
[24767.88s -> 24783.30s]  All right. That's a good it works
[24783.38s -> 24804.76s]  Is there any healing my health is there healing or anyone healing?
[24809.84s -> 24814.20s]  Don't do the thing
[24814.44s -> 24817.52s]  Toddler
[24817.52s -> 24821.06s]  All right. I get it. The spirit did a lot of damage it did
[24823.28s -> 24825.92s]  Checkpoint is not where there's no checkpoint

[24852.92s -> 24859.78s]  When I can't believe it
[24859.78s -> 24861.88s]  Forget about the hammer battery. Yeah, it's pointless
[24862.74s -> 24865.78s]  Just throw grenades back and shoot them with the guns stab them with your spear
[24870.05s -> 24873.97s]  Bring the century. I have to walk it the whole way. I'm not doing that
[24879.04s -> 24883.52s]  Video games suck. I hate video games at the worst
[24888.37s -> 24890.93s]  Oh, no, no, I forgot this one up there

[24900.84s -> 24905.83s]  I just killed like 50 people
[24916.90s -> 24918.76s]  Now we're good
[24918.76s -> 24922.92s]  We're good. All right. This is I can't believe I missed the save point. I'm so embarrassed
[24923.96s -> 24927.52s]  I'm gonna get the shotgun though
[24927.52s -> 24929.20s]  I'm embarrassed
[24929.20s -> 24932.40s]  Somebody just spit in my face. I swear
[24933.67s -> 24937.03s]  Something just hit me in the mouth that was liquid based and I didn't do anything
[24937.19s -> 24939.19s]  I got somebody spit right in my face
[24939.51s -> 24944.72s]  I need that double oj
[24944.72s -> 24955.09s]  Like i'm seriously coughing from the
[24956.15s -> 24959.51s]  All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
[24960.47s -> 24969.30s]  I have to get the sludge hammer shit. I know I know guys
[24981.33s -> 24982.45s]  Thank you
[24982.45s -> 24986.42s]  Do I have two shotguns if I don't I thank god I do
[24987.06s -> 24989.06s]  All right, i'm gonna drop this
[24989.54s -> 25001.56s]  Where they are, I forgot this is like the orange juice bullshit over here
[25002.20s -> 25016.05s]  Where's that orange juice? What's over there the safe point?
[25026.74s -> 25028.74s]  Uh, wait, this is 28
[25029.14s -> 25031.14s]  Let's do one of these ones like 26
[25037.67s -> 25042.44s]  All right orange juice
[25042.44s -> 25045.16s]  What I there is no orange juice. I blew up the orange juice
[25046.85s -> 25049.17s]  I have to settle for these fucking stupid jelly beans
[25049.73s -> 25060.96s]  There's no oj in these boxes. Nothing
[25063.54s -> 25065.54s]  Well, just gonna have to kill him
[25066.98s -> 25070.50s]  Get a beer hat beer head
[25075.83s -> 25081.27s]  No, I should have brought grandma
[25081.59s -> 25084.15s]  No, as long as I play this correctly, I just need to use the stabber
[25084.87s -> 25087.03s]  When he gets in close stab him shoot him with the guns
[25087.51s -> 25088.63s]  Dodge
[25088.63s -> 25094.56s]  Just checking for orange juice
[25094.56s -> 25099.60s]  I thought that was a huge jug of orange juice. I was like that's two or three of them in one container
[25100.24s -> 25101.60s]  That's disappointing
[25101.60s -> 25112.93s]  I can throw them back
[25112.93s -> 25116.45s]  I'm gonna do shotgun first
[25116.85s -> 25118.85s]  Because it's easy, uh tick damage
[25120.39s -> 25130.55s]  I ain't moving. Jesus christ
[25149.72s -> 25157.78s]  Throw it
[25157.78s -> 25178.74s]  Grenade out
[25178.74s -> 25184.74s]  done
[25184.74s -> 25191.01s]  Don't lose it
[25192.48s -> 25194.48s]  If he throws a grenade, it's gonna be too far
[25195.48s -> 25197.96s]  Too far that's too far, but I have to do it. I gotta go for it
[25213.83s -> 25216.96s]  Throw one. I got a club. I'm losing time here
[25218.52s -> 25220.52s]  This is way too long to be spending on this
[25223.19s -> 25224.63s]  Jesus
[25224.63s -> 25235.51s]  I have a new plan
[25235.51s -> 25239.99s]  It's grenade stabbed like three times. I'm gonna throw it after he throws a grenade. Here we go. Ready? Watch this
[25244.79s -> 25248.92s]  Didn't work
[25248.92s -> 25271.96s]  Oh, don't shoot me, please
[25274.00s -> 25276.80s]  There's a rifle. Give me the rifle throw me over there. That's where I want to be
[25286.85s -> 25294.79s]  Why did I do that? I'm gonna die. Oh fucking bounced
[25295.43s -> 25297.43s]  Bad bounce really bad bounce
[25301.20s -> 25303.20s]  I've got to get over there
[25305.32s -> 25313.80s]  Change places with me
[25313.80s -> 25324.55s]  Wait my turn. Oh fuck
[25324.55s -> 25326.55s]  That's been a great
[25344.26s -> 25346.26s]  The orange juices are destroyed
[25346.58s -> 25350.66s]  The orange juices are destroyed. I can't even oh i'm so
[25359.46s -> 25362.90s]  Just slash him. I'm okay. I'm going for the technique called
[25363.38s -> 25367.62s]  Who cares just go try to stab him in the face over and over again and then dodge his kick
[25368.66s -> 25370.66s]  Wait, do we ever go over this?
[25371.14s -> 25374.26s]  Wait, they they wait. Oh, wait. Wait, they respond they respond don't they?
[25376.16s -> 25379.11s]  Joe juices
[25379.11s -> 25381.32s]  I gotta get this guy off
[25381.32s -> 25382.28s]  Get off
[25382.28s -> 25387.49s]  He's coming
[25387.49s -> 25395.59s]  They respawn
[25395.59s -> 25397.67s]  I can get the juices so that we're gonna get rid of
[25399.11s -> 25401.11s]  The shotguns are useless
[25401.11s -> 25402.63s]  It's not gonna work
[25402.63s -> 25404.79s]  I gotta get in there. I gotta throw grenades
[25405.59s -> 25429.70s]  Assault rifle will work shotguns not gonna do it. I can't fucking believe it. Thank god. You interrupted me
[25435.30s -> 25437.30s]  Just pick it up man, they're so fast
[25437.94s -> 25439.94s]  They just run up and you
[25440.02s -> 25447.99s]  Save it again
[25447.99s -> 25449.99s]  Just get away from me
[25450.39s -> 25458.66s]  No redo it
[25458.66s -> 25460.66s]  Just redo it for the love of
[25465.24s -> 25467.24s]  I need these two heals for this fight
[25468.00s -> 25471.60s]  Imagine killing the zombies imagine going over to kill the zombies
[25472.16s -> 25474.16s]  But they've upgraded their characters
[25475.09s -> 25477.09s]  And if they sneeze on you
[25477.81s -> 25495.67s]  It stuns you okay. Just pick them up
[25505.04s -> 25507.04s]  Get the fuck out of my way
[25507.60s -> 25510.82s]  Oh
[25510.82s -> 25512.82s]  Why are you so hard?
[25512.90s -> 25524.61s]  It's like running into a wall
[25526.47s -> 25529.11s]  You know get rid of this fucking thing too. What a waste of space
[25529.67s -> 25541.27s]  I'm making a new one. Anyways
[25541.27s -> 25545.52s]  I'm ready. You know the plan. You know, the drill drill is very simple
[25554.24s -> 25555.28s]  So
[25555.28s -> 25557.68s]  Where's the assault rifle? I know there's one over there. I'm gonna wait till he
[25558.32s -> 25562.61s]  Just let it run. That's all right
[25562.85s -> 25565.32s]  Okay, here he comes
[25565.32s -> 25566.84s]  one stab
[25566.84s -> 25567.80s]  Dodge
[25567.80s -> 25574.32s]  Why is he chasing me? He's not supposed to do this
[25575.08s -> 25577.41s]  He's not supposed to do this
[25577.41s -> 25601.60s]  Assault rifles over here. Don't shoot him
[25602.16s -> 25624.79s]  That didn't do very much damage considering. He just got hit by two
[25625.35s -> 25630.15s]  So I didn't get it
[25630.15s -> 25634.44s]  Oh my god, this is horrible
[25649.81s -> 25665.38s]  Aim for his head. It doesn't do anything and they also have like when you shoot them
[25665.78s -> 25669.06s]  There's like a one or two second period where they have invincibility frames
[25682.60s -> 25683.72s]  Yeah
[25683.72s -> 25701.75s]  Am I dead? I'm dead. Where is it? Just drink the oil
[25702.87s -> 25705.11s]  Is that I wonder if there's anything else around here I could do
[25705.75s -> 25716.52s]  Oh fuck it's over. He's gonna kick me
[25718.53s -> 25719.81s]  god
[25719.81s -> 25730.87s]  I missed
[25730.87s -> 25732.87s]  So if I try to stab him more than once
[25733.27s -> 25736.88s]  He just hits you it's tough
[25737.60s -> 25740.66s]  I'll get it
[25740.66s -> 25744.34s]  I'm not i'm not even gonna use a gun. The guns don't do they're not that good
[25747.65s -> 25749.65s]  What's the most damaging thing that I have?
[25749.65s -> 25763.65s]  Just pick it up
[25763.65s -> 25769.89s]  Fuck
[25769.89s -> 25777.51s]  I think the stab takes too long switch items during a roll
[25787.60s -> 25789.12s]  Eat the trash can food
[25789.12s -> 25803.33s]  Uh and and i'll puke. Yeah
[25804.21s -> 25809.00s]  There was nothing in that one. That's kind of stupid
[25813.56s -> 25817.62s]  Any more trash bags on a drill?
[25818.26s -> 25830.08s]  That was like a I thought that was a cantaloupe magazine bikes
[25831.25s -> 25833.25s]  Bike durability will last three times longer
[25834.60s -> 25836.36s]  Somebody else can read that
[25836.36s -> 25844.80s]  How's the toughest boss treating you?
[25845.36s -> 25848.00s]  um
[25848.00s -> 25849.84s]  I mean he's kind of annoying
[25849.84s -> 25852.24s]  It is hard. Yeah, it's this guy sucks
[25853.04s -> 25858.23s]  See if I can do with melee
[25878.68s -> 25880.68s]  I wanted to take a photo
[25881.80s -> 25883.80s]  Left trigger right bumper and right trigger
[25884.20s -> 25900.20s]  Why does that not hurt him?
[25900.20s -> 25901.33s]  like
[25901.33s -> 25903.33s]  Why did he not get hurt by that?
[25903.41s -> 25906.85s]  I'm so confused
[25907.09s -> 25916.23s]  Fuck
[25916.23s -> 25918.23s]  I clearly hit him right in the fucking chest
[25918.95s -> 25924.98s]  I mean I can do two hits
[25924.98s -> 25936.29s]  I'm gonna cheese this right here. He's gonna go for a kick idiot
[25937.17s -> 25940.24s]  Who's the dumb one now sergeant?
[25940.72s -> 25953.84s]  I can't even I don't know his name is
[25953.84s -> 25960.13s]  Hit me with that
[25960.13s -> 25967.20s]  Now everyone's gonna laugh and go like he missed lol he missed. Yeah, did he did he?
[25971.56s -> 25973.00s]  I don't think he did
[25973.00s -> 25995.64s]  Where the fuck did he go?
[25998.26s -> 26007.03s]  He baited me
[26007.03s -> 26009.03s]  Tell me i'm wrong. Tell me
[26009.03s -> 26021.25s]  Rest again, you know, well, he missed again easy idiot. No, don't i'm okay. Just stay with the plan stay with the plan
[26028.95s -> 26030.95s]  I have to wait till he's done swinging
[26031.03s -> 26041.04s]  I'm gonna go get it
[26041.04s -> 26042.08s]  Yeah
[26042.08s -> 26043.12s]  Yeah
[26043.12s -> 26045.12s]  Yeah, what would you like for dinner, son?

[26126.24s -> 26128.87s]  No
[26130.58s -> 26133.38s]  He's he's what are you doing? What did you do?
[26134.69s -> 26136.69s]  Don't blow it here. I could just get
[26137.99s -> 26139.99s]  What no way
[26142.39s -> 26146.79s]  Like six arm lengths six arm lengths away
[26153.73s -> 26155.73s]  Swinging through this motherfucker
[26156.29s -> 26159.09s]  Oh, come on. Like what the fuck?
[26159.73s -> 26162.10s]  Should I hit him twice? I don't know if he's gonna tell
[26163.06s -> 26165.06s]  I i'm swinging through the guy
[26167.57s -> 26169.09s]  He's got like
[26169.09s -> 26175.67s]  Eight free no, no, no, no. No, he has like 16 invincibility frames when he swings more than that
[26175.67s -> 26179.51s]  It's like 30. It's like two. It's like three. It's like it's like it's like
[26184.68s -> 26186.68s]  It's like five seconds
[26187.57s -> 26189.57s]  Just get the juice again

[26225.86s -> 26227.54s]  All right out of my way
[26227.54s -> 26256.28s]  What's with the ticking clock that I hear now? What is wrong with these guys?
[26257.17s -> 26258.85s]  Okay
[26258.85s -> 26260.42s]  Yay
[26260.42s -> 26266.34s]  Yay. Hooray. We get to do it again this time. I know what to do and this time hopefully I can hit him
[26266.98s -> 26268.98s]  50 percent of the time that I swing
[26269.06s -> 26274.63s]  I can't believe he did this elbow strike
[26276.93s -> 26281.89s]  If he hits you with any of his melees you get to see a fun taunt kill every time
[26282.85s -> 26288.58s]  Let's go
[26288.58s -> 26293.78s]  Wait till he gets ammo get to that same spot that I was in or even no, it's gotta be it's gonna be far enough away
[26296.68s -> 26298.12s]  This one is all right
[26298.12s -> 26310.61s]  I didn't like that setup
[26310.61s -> 26318.18s]  You guys think i'm cheating this guy when he attacks has game genie turned up with every fucking code
[26321.62s -> 26347.48s]  He just doesn't exist
[26347.48s -> 26355.01s]  Truly truly about to fucking go next level mad. I'm gonna try this weapon

[26374.44s -> 26376.87s]  What a catastrophe
[26376.87s -> 26378.87s]  Stop talking
[26391.27s -> 26394.79s]  In the right direction oh i'm just breaking this whole counter
[26395.91s -> 26405.19s]  I honestly feel like i'm drinking estus
[26405.27s -> 26419.03s]  That's what it actually feels like
[26419.03s -> 26421.03s]  This is not the run. This is not the run
[26421.83s -> 26453.49s]  You can only do it once
[26480.15s -> 26482.39s]  It's gonna happen I will beat this guy
[26483.59s -> 26485.99s]  Okay
[26485.99s -> 26487.91s]  Everybody just relax
[26487.91s -> 26490.31s]  And there is extra juice on the ground
[26490.95s -> 26492.95s]  We can just scum this
[26493.43s -> 26495.43s]  Um, hold on a minute here
[26496.56s -> 26498.64s]  I'm gonna be a piece of scum
[26499.78s -> 26501.78s]  Like truly dogshit
[26501.78s -> 26508.12s]  What am I magazine? No, I need this
[26511.97s -> 26513.88s]  No, I don't need that much
[26513.88s -> 26516.07s]  I really don't need that much
[26516.07s -> 26518.07s]  I just need my spear. Okay, i'm gonna drink
[26518.63s -> 26519.67s]  No
[26519.67s -> 26521.67s]  It's it's unlimited juice it is
[26530.56s -> 26534.85s]  Okay, well I worked

[26538.84s -> 26545.28s]  stop

[26706.87s -> 26722.55s]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, we did it. It was easy
[26724.61s -> 26754.53s]  Don't make me laugh. I'm not gonna let you bite me

[26777.68s -> 26790.20s]  How am I gonna do this in time? There's another case after this
[26790.84s -> 26804.23s]  Just go fast

[27020.79s -> 27022.79s]  one two three
[27023.43s -> 27037.64s]  This doesn't look right
[27063.46s -> 27069.30s]  It's almost like the actor was so bad that they just superimposed a mask on and redubbed all of his lines
[27075.64s -> 27077.64s]  He was just the name they gave me
[27078.04s -> 27079.68s]  they

[27099.89s -> 27101.89s]  You all that does have some relevance. You're right
[27105.88s -> 27125.94s]  He's not going anywhere that mask has to weigh a ton
[27125.94s -> 27132.02s]  One standard operating procedure means there'll be another rescue operation it fails again
[27133.35s -> 27134.87s]  That thing's probably
[27134.87s -> 27136.87s]  They had 10 to 15 pounds at least
[27138.77s -> 27141.57s]  That's like a eight pound nine pound ten pound
[27142.45s -> 27152.56s]  Boy smells really bad, too

[27155.12s -> 27157.12s]  But he's nose blind
[27158.04s -> 27161.56s]  You can't he has no idea what it smells like in there when he takes that off and somebody's around him

[27370.85s -> 27372.85s]  Gas barrel that's a propane barrel
[27374.23s -> 27378.23s]  Lulu, these are all made up people. So this is not canon people who cares about these people?
[27381.59s -> 27383.59s]  Oh, no, not chris
[27384.84s -> 27386.84s]  I had such a connection with that character
[27387.08s -> 27400.71s]  These people just accidentally found their way in here
[27401.27s -> 27407.17s]  Crystal's the only real person and she's doing just fine
[27409.67s -> 27410.95s]  Okay now
[27410.95s -> 27414.88s]  Is that it?
[27414.88s -> 27416.48s]  Hack the panel
[27416.48s -> 27424.53s]  How does one hack a panel?
[27425.51s -> 27429.80s]  Uh
[27429.80s -> 27446.58s]  Where's the panel?
[27446.58s -> 27448.98s]  Wait, wait, no, you guys are gonna back up the zombie part
[27449.70s -> 27451.70s]  You're getting a little too close too quickly
[27452.39s -> 27454.79s]  Reset to one wait for the actor to come through
[27501.97s -> 27505.54s]  Did I do it?
[27505.54s -> 27537.20s]  I did it hack the I think I did it. I win. I did actually do it. I think forever loading screen. That's a problem
[27537.28s -> 27562.98s]  That's not good. I think we're gonna have to reset the game. Just wait. What if it corrupt my save?
[27564.34s -> 27567.38s]  Just wait
[27567.38s -> 27582.61s]  No, that's it. I'll give it 10 more seconds. It's loading a really great cinematic
[27582.77s -> 27584.77s]  Yeah, it's this it's loading
[27585.51s -> 27587.51s]  Like 30 000 people on screen at once
[27588.61s -> 27601.94s]  They're all dressed as blanca. Well, you're gonna know when to fold
[27602.74s -> 27604.98s]  This is a fold scenario. Let's try it again
[27610.82s -> 27612.82s]  Uh, where's the last checkpoint?
[27617.00s -> 27618.68s]  Now that's a great question
[27618.68s -> 27620.52s]  It's right before that I think
[27620.52s -> 27633.06s]  Let's try it again. Oh, that's not that's a sound. I haven't heard before when opening the game
[27642.92s -> 27645.72s]  Uh, the game's not opening but it's playing sound
[27646.74s -> 27655.19s]  I don't even have it on my task manager
[27655.19s -> 27663.51s]  There's just a weird window here
[27663.51s -> 27671.03s]  Uh, that's weird. Let's try that again
[27671.67s -> 27674.72s]  Okay
[27674.72s -> 27676.72s]  Starting to get a little concerned here
[27686.69s -> 27694.48s]  I think we're good. There we go
[27704.24s -> 27711.41s]  Start game
[27711.41s -> 27713.41s]  Uh, yeah, we're okay
[27713.57s -> 27716.40s]  It's right here, right? Yep
[27716.40s -> 27718.40s]  I just have to do all that bullshit again
[27718.48s -> 27726.21s]  I think this whole thing again. All right. How do I prevent that from happening though?
[27731.75s -> 27733.75s]  I'm kind of scared of this mission
[27744.58s -> 27749.96s]  Where am I going?
[27750.12s -> 27756.26s]  Oh cool a nectar
[27756.34s -> 27764.64s]  Anything else back here?
[27770.04s -> 27772.04s]  Use it watch this
[27772.12s -> 27773.64s]  This is gonna be crazy
[27773.64s -> 27788.92s]  Give me the queen
[27789.32s -> 27794.53s]  All right, we're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back
[27800.02s -> 27809.51s]  It's a pc gaming wiki article about this. There's no way to progress
[27812.56s -> 27817.84s]  Uh, I can't click this. It'll crash the game. Uh, give me a give me a tldr of what that says
[27836.63s -> 27841.19s]  Use your phone. It's okay. All right. Well, whatever
[27842.93s -> 27844.93s]  Wait, is it the other room? No, it's down here, isn't it?
[27845.89s -> 27860.13s]  No, it's in the other room
[27860.13s -> 27865.89s]  I have to what open user profile documents my game's dead rising off the record render settings. I ni
[27866.05s -> 27870.53s]  Change the use multi-core entry to false after getting past this loading screen. You're free to charge
[27872.29s -> 27894.05s]  Let me just see if I can get it to work once let's get that last one
[27897.27s -> 27899.27s]  Changing one value all right
[27900.47s -> 27902.71s]  Yeah, this is not we're gonna have to change ini files
[27903.67s -> 27905.67s]  Like 90 of the way through the game
[27906.47s -> 27910.24s]  Come on, what do you want to build here?
[27919.80s -> 27921.96s]  It's the gas barrel. I'm looking i'm looking at chat
[27923.81s -> 27929.09s]  All right. So let me i'm gonna hit i'm gonna pause it and then unpause it and pause it really fast and see what happens
[27929.97s -> 27988.80s]  Hurry before crystal dies
[27988.80s -> 28000.77s]  All right, what's the file user? Okay. I've given the link where is it rising the rising link? There it is
[28000.85s -> 28003.25s]  Okay, so go to my user profile settings
[28004.21s -> 28013.22s]  Yeah, edit the ini, okay. Yeah, I just gotta get it
[28015.44s -> 28017.60s]  uh
[28017.60s -> 28019.60s]  Open user. Yeah the user profile
[28025.46s -> 28034.12s]  Documents my game's dead rising off the record. Okay, bronc cam
[28034.76s -> 28043.64s]  Don't tell him where it is. He's deleting the game
[28047.22s -> 28048.74s]  all right, uh
[28048.74s -> 28053.94s]  It's documents, right? What the hell documents? No, it's you have to do like the percent percent percent thing
[28053.94s -> 28057.06s]  What's it called percent user profile percent or is that just?
[28057.70s -> 28069.00s]  Okay
[28069.00s -> 28071.00s]  Uh documents my games
[28078.79s -> 28081.83s]  Dead rising 2 off the record. There's the render settings
[28086.42s -> 28088.74s]  Change the use multi-core to false
[28097.30s -> 28099.84s]  false save
[28099.84s -> 28117.67s]  After getting past this loading screen, you are free to change it back. What if I just keep it i'm gonna be on one core
[28124.88s -> 28126.88s]  suit up
[28137.96s -> 28144.10s]  You get a poodle face when you're pissed. I don't i'm not even sure what you mean by that
[28147.28s -> 28149.44s]  Your macbook is heating up I know
[28150.40s -> 28155.92s]  I'm working on it. Oh, this is horrible
[28156.56s -> 28160.48s]  Okay, I have to get through this
[28160.48s -> 28162.48s]  This is 10 frames a second
[28173.19s -> 28181.19s]  It's a hard mode
[28184.68s -> 28187.48s]  I am not gonna leave this if we're saving it right when this is done
[28198.15s -> 28200.15s]  You know, I used to play games like this guys
[28201.33s -> 28205.12s]  It sucked. I played games like this
[28210.64s -> 28230.24s]  And the resolution was even lower. Give me it back. Give me this pull
[28230.96s -> 28233.28s]  This is you know, it's the sound it's doing too
[28239.44s -> 28258.68s]  I think button pro. I think button presses are not registering at some point wrong way. I know I don't know going the wrong way
[28258.76s -> 28276.42s]  It's hard to pay attention buffering inputs. I yeah it is it's like using fraps
[28286.93s -> 28288.93s]  I think I actually played
[28292.34s -> 28294.44s]  all
[28294.44s -> 28295.16s]  of
[28295.16s -> 28297.00s]  soldier of fortune like this
[28306.20s -> 28308.20s]  How I don't know I did
[28310.56s -> 28315.20s]  I'm specifically remembering this insane slowdown with my computer. My computer was a piece of crap
[28315.92s -> 28324.76s]  Okay moment of truth. Did it work?
[28325.64s -> 28337.86s]  It worked
[28337.86s -> 28352.07s]  Nice
[28352.07s -> 28365.19s]  Yeah
[28375.94s -> 28378.92s]  And
[28378.92s -> 28384.88s]  ladies and gentlemen
[28384.88s -> 28396.08s]  we've reached the eight hour mark we have
[28400.14s -> 28402.77s]  Probably because there's
[28402.79s -> 28404.95s]  There's definitely something after this as well
[28416.50s -> 28422.92s]  You said dude I said I was gonna try to finish it I said I was gonna try to finish it
[28425.88s -> 28428.52s]  so
[28428.52s -> 28435.51s]  Hmm. I have I have doctor shit to do over the next couple days
[28448.85s -> 28451.57s]  I'm trying to think of anyone how much time is actually left
[28452.52s -> 28456.44s]  Like probably four five six hours something like that. I could probably have another stream on this
[28457.00s -> 28464.28s]  There's another maybe six hours or so four hours six hours
[28465.24s -> 28467.24s]  Then that's a whole that's another stream then
[28471.97s -> 28473.09s]  four hours
[28473.09s -> 28477.75s]  Because is there an overtime in this game? I'll be doing that too
[28484.13s -> 28487.52s]  Okay
[28487.52s -> 28489.52s]  Yeah. All right guys. Yeah
[28491.30s -> 28494.63s]  It was a ton of fucking fun. I love this game
[28495.97s -> 28497.80s]  but
[28497.80s -> 28501.64s]  We are going this is probably not going to be the only thing we do on friday
[28503.04s -> 28507.44s]  Because if I can if I blow through this in like two or three hours, then we'll just move on to the next thing
[28511.32s -> 28513.32s]  So we're gonna open with
[28513.32s -> 28515.32s]  Dead rising 2 off the record. I'm gonna beat it
[28515.80s -> 28522.55s]  The kind of doctor stuff I have I have a couple of appointments that I need to go to
[28524.60s -> 28527.35s]  And one of them is long
[28530.34s -> 28532.64s]  So we'll see you on friday
[28532.64s -> 28534.98s]  We'll conclude this
[28534.98s -> 28537.54s]  Let me say let me like save it and make sure everything is good to go
[28540.26s -> 28542.26s]  Oh, I like
[28542.26s -> 28545.22s]  I love this game though. I love these both dead rising dead rising 2
[28546.96s -> 28548.24s]  It's just
[28548.24s -> 28550.24s]  It's equal parts frustrating
[28551.30s -> 28553.64s]  hilarious
[28553.64s -> 28557.19s]  Stressful and I I love this game
[28557.75s -> 28571.89s]  Now we're gonna go with save slot one. That's the best kind of game. I know it really is
[28572.53s -> 28575.54s]  But we'll see you friday
[28575.54s -> 28578.34s]  I'm just gonna let this play out and make sure I have a good spot
[28584.39s -> 28586.71s]  Yeah, i'll change the config back. Wait, did he just die?
[28587.59s -> 28595.80s]  I'll do that right before i'll do actually while we're just hanging out with you
[28623.73s -> 28628.50s]  Zombrex frankey, and you gotta move no, he needs zombrex
[28632.96s -> 28637.28s]  Looks like you got yourself bit pretty bad there tk. He's not turning yet
[28638.08s -> 28639.12s]  why
[28639.12s -> 28643.76s]  Some people are just more resistant to the infection than others. I'm just story man
[28644.48s -> 28646.48s]  You gotta help me
[28646.48s -> 28647.76s]  so
[28647.76s -> 28652.76s]  Won't know until he turns
[28655.00s -> 28658.47s]  How much money do I have?
[28658.47s -> 28661.75s]  It's 150 000 for an extra zombrex in the store
[28676.39s -> 28678.39s]  I have two
[28678.79s -> 28703.42s]  There's a weird shitty x-men
[28745.24s -> 28751.13s]  You know what would make this game so much better if frank west had intermittent
[28752.47s -> 28755.86s]  Rick burps
[28789.40s -> 28791.40s]  It's too late for that kind of
[28799.96s -> 28802.38s]  Retrack that no it stays
[28808.88s -> 28812.45s]  Uh, you still got a sprained ankle sit down
[28817.46s -> 28819.46s]  Shrek
[28823.59s -> 28828.07s]  Um, i'm getting a little uh, i'm getting a little sleep. I'm not even that tired
[28828.15s -> 28831.51s]  I kind of am but not really go for the kiss do it
[28837.14s -> 28839.14s]  I thought she was gonna go for a kiss
[28839.86s -> 28857.73s]  All right, save it
[28857.73s -> 28859.73s]  All right. We got lots of time
[28861.36s -> 28863.68s]  So now we're good to go game is saved
[28865.35s -> 28867.35s]  I'll see you guys on friday
[28871.12s -> 28881.41s]  Hell yeah, no change the file. Yeah, i'll do it right now
[28884.53s -> 28888.80s]  Restart story
[28888.80s -> 28890.72s]  I wanted to get it done tonight, but
[28890.72s -> 28893.44s]  It's all right. I i'd rather not push it
[28894.76s -> 28896.84s]  into like early this morning and
[28898.15s -> 28900.15s]  Already starting to lose my mind
[28900.15s -> 28904.77s]  And I mean, I don't want to reach simpson's hit and run levels of insanity
[28911.96s -> 28914.58s]  So we'll see you friday
[28914.66s -> 28918.50s]  Have a good midweek. We'll finish this up. We'll start. Um
[28923.81s -> 28927.57s]  You know what I might do on friday after dead rising
[28931.64s -> 28933.96s]  Because that would be a pretty good spot to do it. I think
[28939.97s -> 28942.20s]  uh katamari
[28942.20s -> 28952.26s]  for xbox 360
[28952.26s -> 28954.76s]  That sounds like a pretty good place to do it
[28954.76s -> 28960.12s]  Start with dead rising and who knows dead rising 2 might just take the whole stream
[28961.43s -> 28964.63s]  Depends on how long overtime takes depends on how many times I fail
[28965.03s -> 28968.77s]  Uh over and over again at a certain part. I'm not sure we'll see
[28969.33s -> 28972.98s]  Am I gonna do dead rising 3?
[28974.88s -> 28976.08s]  Yes
[28976.08s -> 28978.08s]  But that will be the last one that I do
[28981.59s -> 28983.59s]  I'm not gonna play dead rising 4
[28988.12s -> 28990.20s]  I already did
[28990.20s -> 28992.20s]  And I did not like it at all
[28997.17s -> 29000.32s]  Ban him for life
[29000.32s -> 29004.16s]  So but i'm not gonna do dead rising 3 immediately. I actually didn't even plan to do dead rising
[29005.11s -> 29012.74s]  Two immediately just kind of was like you know what I let's do it. Thanks for sticking around as always
[29015.99s -> 29017.99s]  These are some of my favorite types of games to play
[29018.71s -> 29020.71s]  Because I feel like there's a lot of fun
[29021.03s -> 29023.75s]  Interactions to have there's a lot of ways the game can be played
[29024.79s -> 29028.60s]  So i'm having a blast
[29028.60s -> 29032.36s]  But that is the end I will see you friday. Let's do the bits
[29035.43s -> 29037.59s]  going back
[29037.59s -> 29039.59s]  To abomination zero. Thanks for the 250
[29041.86s -> 29045.78s]  I mailed you a cooking an envelope full of milk. It's up to you to eat it or turn it down
[29046.18s -> 29049.22s]  And give up your point. You have 72 hours to decide
[29051.52s -> 29054.16s]  Well at that point it'll be rotten and I don't think it'd be very edible
[29058.69s -> 29060.24s]  Thank you, though
[29060.24s -> 29065.20s]  Well fade thanks to the 300 bits. Hey jerm, I was wondering if you could stream rainbow 6 vegas 2
[29065.92s -> 29068.10s]  it's a fun tactical shooter and
[29068.42s -> 29070.82s]  The terrorists in game call you swear words
[29071.46s -> 29076.87s]  I feel like I would be way way too adhd to play that game
[29081.03s -> 29086.39s]  Doesn't that require real strategy and tactics? You can't just run in there and just start throwing grenades
[29090.82s -> 29094.92s]  Put it on the list
[29094.92s -> 29098.98s]  rainbow 6 vegas 2
[29098.98s -> 29102.63s]  That might be a disaster
[29102.63s -> 29105.99s]  But at it. Yeah. Well, i'm all right. Let's do it. Whatever
[29107.60s -> 29112.32s]  Uh germa ass stinky feet. Thanks for the 250 bits. Hey germa. I know you hate my username
[29112.96s -> 29114.96s]  I don't think it's that funny anymore either
[29117.38s -> 29118.82s]  The serious question
[29118.82s -> 29124.42s]  I got diagnosed with adhd a few months ago and was wondering if you had any tips for doing schoolwork without taking adderall
[29124.82s -> 29128.10s]  I don't want to become dependent on it and you've been living with adhd for longer than I have
[29129.06s -> 29131.06s]  I used to actually take adderall
[29132.15s -> 29133.86s]  20 years ago
[29133.86s -> 29137.94s]  It suppressed my appetite that and ritalin is what I was on. I switched
[29138.66s -> 29140.66s]  Uh, it suppressed my appetite
[29140.66s -> 29148.07s]  I didn't like it. So I stopped taking it and
[29149.65s -> 29151.65s]  I you kind of just have to try
[29154.05s -> 29156.85s]  You just have to let it take over if i'm honest
[29158.79s -> 29160.87s]  because
[29160.87s -> 29164.71s]  If you when you have adhd you have scatter brain all over the place
[29165.65s -> 29169.75s]  But when you scatter in each individual piece
[29171.54s -> 29174.90s]  Should be something that you can focus on enough to make something work
[29177.57s -> 29180.96s]  You kind of just have to
[29180.96s -> 29183.76s]  Unless you want to take medicine for it because there really is no other way
[29184.48s -> 29188.64s]  You either take some medication to like kind of even you out a little bit or
[29189.76s -> 29191.76s]  You just kind of play it out
[29192.24s -> 29195.28s]  And this is what i'm focusing on right now. This is what I care about right now. Okay, well
[29196.98s -> 29199.70s]  Do it very well for the time that you're going to focus on it
[29201.70s -> 29205.46s]  how people with adhd get in trouble and i've been i've done it in the past
[29206.10s -> 29207.57s]  is
[29207.57s -> 29214.05s]  You you get scattered but you don't focus on any of the things you're scattering around and you
[29214.37s -> 29216.37s]  You spread out so much and you're just so
[29216.69s -> 29222.72s]  So distractible that you don't you need to at least have one of those things be something that you can pay attention to for a while
[29223.36s -> 29230.00s]  Some people have it way worse than others
[29230.00s -> 29231.36s]  But there's no
[29231.36s -> 29234.32s]  I mean not that i've been able to even think if there's no oh, yeah, just
[29235.70s -> 29242.88s]  Do this and your adhd will go away. It's not I guess if you want like actual advice
[29244.34s -> 29246.92s]  Uh, turn off your phone. That's number one
[29247.83s -> 29253.78s]  If you're doing something important don't have your phone in your room with you or an ipad or or
[29254.50s -> 29258.10s]  You don't want to have any distractions like that because it's so easy to pick up a phone
[29262.63s -> 29269.38s]  What happened? Let me check my twitter. Let me check this. Let me do this quiet the room down
[29269.62s -> 29276.28s]  Even stuff like listening to music can distract the part of your brain that needs to be distracted while you do something else
[29276.60s -> 29291.60s]  So your mind gets to play with the songs that are being played while you do the work that helps
[29292.95s -> 29294.95s]  Even background noise doesn't even need to be
[29295.11s -> 29300.87s]  Um music put on a podcast put on something just to have something to pay attention to while you're doing something
[29301.11s -> 29307.54s]  That's what I use twitch for
[29307.54s -> 29318.18s]  Yeah, and if it works it works as I watch your streams also moving around
[29318.66s -> 29321.99s]  Somebody just said pace around
[29321.99s -> 29327.97s]  It that actually helps too moving around while you're doing something
[29328.92s -> 29331.22s]  Oh, yeah
[29331.22s -> 29333.62s]  Just don't move around away from like your desk too long
[29334.18s -> 29338.93s]  But go over something in your head sit down write it down do whatever you're gonna do get up move around a little bit
[29338.93s -> 29343.14s]  Have something in your hand
[29343.14s -> 29345.14s]  Rubik's cubes are great, but you have to know how to do them
[29345.22s -> 29348.34s]  Otherwise, you're just gonna continue to be just gonna be you'll never get it right
[29348.90s -> 29356.85s]  But also don't if you don't want to take
[29357.49s -> 29362.05s]  If you've never taken something like adderall before request to see if you can get put on a low dose
[29362.95s -> 29365.91s]  Sometimes you don't need that much. You just need like enough
[29367.08s -> 29369.08s]  to start to correct you
[29374.36s -> 29376.36s]  at least up there if you have
[29377.56s -> 29381.24s]  Chemicals kind of in balance and all flying around sometimes a low dose
[29381.96s -> 29387.81s]  The doctor might just be like, yeah, you know, we can start you off on this and see how you do
[29388.53s -> 29397.22s]  Instead of just going just balls to the wall. Give me a full dose and then you feel like shit
[29397.22s -> 29400.84s]  It's doesn't and you don't you didn't get scared of it because you don't want to take it anymore
[29404.63s -> 29406.47s]  And it ain't just adderall
[29406.47s -> 29408.55s]  There's a lot of different medications out there now
[29410.00s -> 29418.63s]  Some of them might be better for you than others
[29418.63s -> 29420.63s]  There yeah, they're very there are a lot of options
[29421.19s -> 29423.35s]  Do I still take no I have not taken it in a long time
[29426.32s -> 29427.44s]  But I've
[29427.44s -> 29430.88s]  Contrary to what you guys might actually believe i've slowed down a lot
[29432.77s -> 29434.77s]  I used to be
[29434.77s -> 29436.70s]  like
[29436.70s -> 29438.70s]  Uncontrollable I was all over the place
[29439.04s -> 29441.04s]  20 years ago 15 years ago
[29441.04s -> 29447.78s]  I had so much just energy that had to be expelled
[29448.50s -> 29455.25s]  If you think that i'm all over the place now
[29456.31s -> 29458.55s]  You should have seemed like 15 year old me
[29459.43s -> 29466.60s]  That was off the walls
[29467.56s -> 29475.70s]  Did it calm down on its own it sort of did but it's always there it doesn't matter guys i'll put my keys down
[29476.84s -> 29478.29s]  on the counter
[29478.29s -> 29481.25s]  And i'll something will how i'll walk in another room
[29481.81s -> 29486.29s]  And then the keys don't exist anymore and I walk around the whole fucking house
[29486.91s -> 29488.69s]  searching for them
[29488.69s -> 29490.69s]  And they're just right in front of me
[29495.83s -> 29499.11s]  I lose things so easily. That's why I have to keep everything in my pocket
[29501.67s -> 29503.67s]  Everything that I need stays with me
[29504.39s -> 29511.62s]  And that's why I got those tiles
[29512.18s -> 29514.18s]  To be able to ping my stuff
[29515.14s -> 29517.14s]  When I inevitably lose it every single day
[29520.68s -> 29524.28s]  And you I've like complained about those things, too. Is there any product that I like?
[29525.00s -> 29529.70s]  Have you guys ever heard me talk about like a product that I own that I actually enjoyed does that happen?
[29537.04s -> 29541.60s]  McChickens, okay, dr. Roker's pizza. All right hash house a go go at the link. Okay
[29542.24s -> 29546.16s]  Banana milk. Yeah. All right bananas jet blue. That's right
[29547.33s -> 29551.17s]  Cheez-its. Okay, you got me. Yeah, jet blue is the best airline like without a doubt
[29551.17s -> 29553.17s]  No, no questions asked
[29554.53s -> 29560.77s]  If you can fly on jet blue, do not ever take another airplane for the rest of your life. Just don't there's no reason to
[29561.33s -> 29566.63s]  Alaska airlines is better
[29566.63s -> 29570.63s]  I'm not maybe but that's a smaller airline. I don't know jet blue is pretty good
[29574.84s -> 29577.48s]  Their seats are really comfortable. They did free snacks
[29578.36s -> 29581.84s]  Wi-fi on every plane
[29581.84s -> 29587.44s]  They got a ton of direct flights you listen to this you want to fly a shitload of the other airlines
[29588.08s -> 29590.08s]  Oh, wait, we're stopping first
[29591.16s -> 29593.40s]  Jet blue's got a bunch of great direct flights
[29599.94s -> 29606.95s]  Use code germa, that would never happen. These airlines make so much money
[29607.76s -> 29610.40s]  They don't need me to like sign up
[29611.65s -> 29615.09s]  A handful of people to buy up to have airplane ticket
[29616.66s -> 29619.38s]  They make like a hundred million dollars a week
[29621.16s -> 29624.76s]  Here's the code germa get 10% off. They don't need me
[29628.66s -> 29631.22s]  Use code. Look at me and get 5% off
[29636.64s -> 29644.26s]  But they do
[29644.26s -> 29646.58s]  but I to kind of end that
[29647.22s -> 29650.37s]  tangent there is
[29650.37s -> 29652.13s]  Sometimes you just have to let it
[29652.13s -> 29653.73s]  work out
[29653.73s -> 29655.73s]  If you start getting distracted take a break
[29656.29s -> 29658.64s]  Get up move around
[29658.64s -> 29662.64s]  The reason why I can sit here for so long is because the stuff that i'm doing is so
[29663.76s -> 29668.56s]  Rapid fire that I can't get distracted. I get oh I get distracted in the game
[29669.36s -> 29671.92s]  But not enough for me to have to stand up and go do something else
[29672.95s -> 29683.67s]  You see it happen in the video game. I mean i've been here for eight hours and 15 minutes
[29684.39s -> 29688.47s]  I got up once to pee and grab a water and shake my legs a little bit and
[29689.35s -> 29691.52s]  Like i'm able to do that
[29692.08s -> 29695.76s]  there's enough stimulation going on with the stream with people talking and
[29697.94s -> 29703.86s]  Chad and game stuff and yeah, I could get distracted really easily but it's in it's in it's contained here
[29708.69s -> 29710.69s]  but I wish you luck on your
[29711.25s -> 29714.05s]  ADHD adventure the best part about ADHD is
[29716.32s -> 29723.01s]  it is very very very manageable and
[29724.29s -> 29727.41s]  Sometimes I attribute it to some of the things that I come up with
[29731.00s -> 29733.24s]  So it's not a complete curse
[29738.52s -> 29742.68s]  ADHD adventures
[29742.68s -> 29744.68s]  ADHD comedy
[29745.08s -> 29749.32s]  Why do I feel like that would be a great youtube channel name? It probably already is
[29752.20s -> 29755.56s]  And it's like quick 10 second videos that are all in a playlist
[29756.28s -> 29771.60s]  Like 10 to 15 second comedy videos, that's vine, right? But that doesn't exist anymore. It was taken over by tik tok
[29776.40s -> 29778.58s]  tik tok is vine
[29778.58s -> 29781.06s]  But people just lip sync their favorite songs
[29790.05s -> 29795.04s]  But anyway, uh, thank you c4g for the 300 bits. I haven't been able to watch in this stream
[29795.04s -> 29799.36s]  But my girlfriend is and they say I get the allure of the face cards jerma
[29800.32s -> 29803.36s]  Really? I really do but if you have at least three of a suit
[29803.76s -> 29807.20s]  My best bet is to hold those instead you absolute fucking fool
[29808.08s -> 29810.08s]  But i'm the bits giver in this relationship
[29811.04s -> 29818.05s]  We're playing jacks are better the face cards jacks are better you get your bet back
[29821.49s -> 29823.49s]  Hold it's free of a suit. But if you get queen
[29824.21s -> 29827.41s]  And king you get queen jack jacks are better gives you bet back
[29827.89s -> 29839.92s]  That's the machine we were playing not every machine is jacks are better all in every time. What's the worst that could happen?
[29843.08s -> 29844.36s]  Thank you dark soul for the 250
[29844.36s -> 29848.44s]  Can you explain to us why you have that massive i can has cheeseburger tattoo on your back?
[29849.00s -> 29855.12s]  I don't have an explanation for that
[29855.12s -> 29860.56s]  Swiggity-swanky. Thanks the 250. I'm no doctor, but i'm guessing a majority of your mysterious health problems might be caused from your laughing
[29861.12s -> 29864.16s]  I know that when I strain too much I get lightheaded and weird could be from that
[29865.12s -> 29868.07s]  No, it's not
[29868.07s -> 29869.68s]  uh
[29869.68s -> 29871.04s]  It's something else
[29871.04s -> 29875.14s]  It's something else. I'm sure it doesn't help
[29875.46s -> 29883.64s]  He hates to laugh
[29883.64s -> 29885.97s]  is not
[29885.97s -> 29887.97s]  We we don't think it is like
[29888.69s -> 29892.29s]  Bowel and irritable bowel disease like colitis related
[29893.52s -> 29895.04s]  Something else is going on
[29895.04s -> 29899.97s]  I don't know. We're gonna figure out what the hell's going on
[29905.17s -> 29910.21s]  I've had a lot of random just doctor's appointments and I know we kind of know what's going on
[29910.77s -> 29913.62s]  I don't think it's anything serious
[29913.62s -> 29916.50s]  I've had a ton of tests and a ton of
[29917.72s -> 29919.72s]  stuff poking and prodding
[29921.46s -> 29924.98s]  But if we're getting we're narrowing down and it's just kind of annoying
[29927.38s -> 29929.62s]  If it is the thing that it's might be it's
[29930.58s -> 29935.78s]  There's no reason for me to talk about it because I don't want to concern anybody there's no don't worry. There's no there's no concern
[29936.82s -> 29940.08s]  It's just an annoying thing
[29940.08s -> 29942.77s]  I have to figure out so don't worry
[29947.88s -> 29949.88s]  It's nothing serious, but annoying. Yeah
[29951.96s -> 29955.00s]  I will know much more very very soon. We'll put it that way
[29959.51s -> 29963.19s]  but the reason I don't really talk that much about medical stuff just because I
[29964.95s -> 29968.87s]  Sometimes i'll talk about in like pre-stream or oh, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Oh, don't worry
[29969.35s -> 29975.16s]  I don't want to concern anybody about anything. I'm that everything's gonna be i'm fine. Don't worry
[29975.96s -> 29981.12s]  I don't want people to start like wait, wait, hold on. What's wrong with him? What's something wrong with him?
[29981.28s -> 29986.87s]  Something's wrong with him
[29986.87s -> 29997.19s]  So don't worry. We'll be good to go. But spaghetti swanky. I appreciate the 250. Thank you
[29999.46s -> 30002.66s]  Stinky beaver. Thanks for the 250 soft lock. I don't think so
[30007.14s -> 30009.16s]  Not today
[30009.16s -> 30011.96s]  Uh piff flavor. Thanks for the three dollars. Hey, dude
[30011.96s -> 30015.80s]  I just want to make sure you love auto because I recently lost my dog
[30017.17s -> 30022.21s]  And it sucks to be sure so be sure to love auto and also this is your six percent germ attacks
[30022.69s -> 30024.29s]  I'm really sorry to hear that
[30024.29s -> 30032.48s]  Sure. It was a wonderful dog
[30035.19s -> 30037.19s]  It's a family member. It is
[30037.51s -> 30042.48s]  Plain and simple. Thank you for your 300 bits
[30043.20s -> 30046.10s]  Sorry to hear about your awesome dog
[30054.08s -> 30059.56s]  It's tough. It is. Yeah, they're a lot there. Sometimes they're around for a very long time
[30060.36s -> 30070.37s]  We're gonna sneak
[30070.37s -> 30073.25s]  Into this portion of the stream here. Let's get that there
[30074.71s -> 30079.19s]  Thanks for watching everybody see you friday
[30079.19s -> 30081.19s]  We got the credits to do
[30081.19s -> 30085.12s]  All the subs that rolled in
[30085.12s -> 30092.18s]  Uh a little odd error unable to detect stream start on your platform
[30097.14s -> 30099.14s]  Stream labs error for some reason
[30107.01s -> 30112.98s]  Let me go in here and see why that's doing that stream was never started in the first place
[30115.08s -> 30116.92s]  Weird
[30116.92s -> 30121.73s]  See if I can run it from the website itself
[30134.13s -> 30140.05s]  Stream labs is not even connected to my twitch anymore. They do like an update
[30141.09s -> 30143.09s]  Learn how to stream like a pro
[30143.57s -> 30149.89s]  Okay, i'll try
[30149.89s -> 30154.37s]  All right. Let me see if I can do through here live events
[30155.01s -> 30159.36s]  We need the actual
[30160.96s -> 30162.00s]  widget
[30162.00s -> 30166.60s]  What's wrong with this thing? Okay
[30167.32s -> 30171.86s]  Let's try it again. Here we go

[30179.06s -> 30182.52s]  Uh unable to detect stream
[30183.24s -> 30190.18s]  This is not cool
[30190.18s -> 30192.18s]  Something's wrong with stream labs
[30196.66s -> 30199.22s]  We may not be able to see the sub credits today
[30199.94s -> 30215.54s]  I think it's broken. Let me try it one more time
[30216.10s -> 30220.00s]  credit settings
[30220.00s -> 30222.00s]  Sorry, i'm taking so long
[30223.49s -> 30233.43s]  Test i'm gonna test it not doing anything unable to detect stream start on your platforms
[30234.39s -> 30236.39s]  Yeah, something's wrong here
[30237.46s -> 30242.58s]  Sorry guys. Sorry that this uh, usually this the subscribers all fly by here
[30243.14s -> 30246.53s]  Maybe it's on twitch's end maybe
[30247.72s -> 30250.20s]  But anyways, thank you so much for subbing in the first place

[30267.80s -> 30272.28s]  I've not had very much time
[30272.28s -> 30279.73s]  Wait, what is going on here?
[30279.73s -> 30281.73s]  Well, that ain't right

[30334.07s -> 30341.43s]  As this was happening the chat was watching all this they were collectively agreeing with each other that you weren't that you went too far
[30342.07s -> 30344.07s]  And that you truly were a psycho
[30344.31s -> 30348.04s]  I managed to escape and had a talk with your dad
[30348.76s -> 30353.72s]  He said he always knew this day would come and that you were a problem child the chat spammed lore
[30356.39s -> 30368.47s]  That's
[30368.47s -> 30370.47s]  Just strange enough to be real
