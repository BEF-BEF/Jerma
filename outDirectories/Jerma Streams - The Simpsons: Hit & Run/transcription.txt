[1.59s -> 9.05s]  Got Homa, you got Mod, you got Bot, all of them. They're all in the same place at the same time,
[9.05s -> 20.41s]  they're all driving fucking cars around. That's the plan for tonight, how you guys doing?
[20.41s -> 26.01s]  Simpsons hit and run, uh, got it to work. There was a theory that I might not have gotten it to
[26.01s -> 38.26s]  work, but we delayed, and uh, kill code came through with the, some files, some patches,
[38.82s -> 48.95s]  and I was like, well would you look at that, so we can play it. I do, uh, I own it on
[48.95s -> 58.38s]  PlayStation 2, but I figured try to get it on PC to work, right? So that's what we're doing,
[58.38s -> 64.98s]  give me a minute, I'm just gonna sip my coffee and make sure I have my OBS configured. Gonna
[64.98s -> 127.54s]  see you guys real soon. That just kind of jumped out at you, didn't it? Sorry about that.
[135.74s -> 142.31s]  Sorry, you know what I wish, here's the thing, you know what I would love? I would
[142.31s -> 149.03s]  love if OBS had a feature where I could, like, when I activate a source, right, and maybe they do,
[150.15s -> 155.43s]  I, hold on, turn that down for a second. If I could like have a way, there's a plug-in where
[155.43s -> 160.86s]  I can make it so every time I activate a source, it slowly comes up from zero.
[161.50s -> 165.50s]  That might be hard to do, but man, I wish I could do that, because some of these games,
[166.22s -> 174.15s]  they just blow your ears out. But, uh, here it is. Simpsons hit and run working on PC.
[175.19s -> 179.67s]  This is actually on PC and there are, like, a bunch of mods and shit that you need to have
[180.23s -> 190.15s]  to get this to work. So it is possible. I don't have any, like, funny mods. This is not, like,
[190.15s -> 200.95s]  a funny mod thing. This is, like, get the game to work effectively. Funny mod thing. So,
[200.95s -> 215.54s]  are you ready? How does he, how do we, how do we get the audio? No, it's not a funny mod. Sounds
[215.54s -> 224.86s]  pretty good. Louder. Kind, it's, it's kind of loud. How's that? That's probably better.
[225.58s -> 234.33s]  So, uh, you can still hear me. What have we got? So we got, and plus I can have a controller
[234.33s -> 240.87s]  plugged in. That's the best part. All right. I, people have been waiting for this for a
[240.87s -> 245.53s]  long time. I don't see enough hype in the chat right now. You know, I want to, I want
[245.53s -> 250.17s]  you all to spell it out in one gigantic letter. You know, everyone, you all have to work on
[250.17s -> 259.67s]  H and then P and then E. The one resident sleeper.
[266.82s -> 271.30s]  That you stand out so much. If you're resident sleeper-ing right now, you are.
[271.30s -> 280.50s]  I can sit and look at that toy train that guy's got there. Let's go. There's even 3D
[280.50s -> 297.61s]  animations. Oh God damn it. It's not that. Turn it up. Why is it so low? I can't bump it.
[307.22s -> 317.21s]  We'll fix it. This reminds me of when, remember when they did that episode where Homer went
[317.21s -> 326.73s]  into the 3D world and it was incredibly off-putting? All right. So let's, let's move
[326.73s -> 341.18s]  around. Talk to Marge. Let's jump. Let's move. Let's sprint. This actually doesn't
[341.18s -> 355.42s]  look that bad. How's that? The audio sounds like it's okay right now. How do I turn it
[355.42s -> 368.25s]  up a little bit? Voice and sound. Music a little bit. Yeah. Is that better?
[371.54s -> 375.37s]  That sounds all right. All right, Marge, what do you got? Is this fully voice acted?
[376.33s -> 382.17s]  Homie, somebody ate every dessert in the house. I need you to run to the store and pick up
[382.17s -> 388.25s]  some of that ice cream with the miniature pies in it. Homie, you have to go to the store and
[388.81s -> 395.53s]  pick up that ice cream. Hire me. Hire me. Do it. Go to the quickie mart and purchase some ice
[395.53s -> 401.61s]  cream and cola. It's crashing time. Uh, Homer, that's not a nice thing to say.
[402.57s -> 416.66s]  It's crashing time. Drive to the quickie mart. This is like a, can you crash into people? No.
[418.34s -> 425.08s]  This is like a licensed TV video game. You actually can run. That's it. I can't believe
[425.08s -> 437.11s]  that. That I don't believe it. I don't believe you can do that. What? I thought they were going
[437.11s -> 446.84s]  to jump out of the way. I'm very surprised. All right, drive to the quickie mart and I'm
[446.84s -> 458.25s]  getting points for this. All right. Okay. I got my controller set up. What is this for?
[461.05s -> 469.54s]  Oh, wait. Oh, this is, there's a coin. All right. This is a puzzle.
[470.73s -> 478.22s]  I'm getting on the roof. I can do the sprint, right? Oops. I might have to change some button
[478.22s -> 489.16s]  configurations here because right now B is run. That B and A don't work together is run and then
[489.16s -> 498.41s]  jump. I have it on like the dark soul settings there. Hold on. What does this do? Oh, I can
[498.41s -> 524.38s]  kick. All right. This is kind of cool. Who made this game? Can I just vandalize? From
[524.38s -> 527.18s]  software I made this game. Now imagine if they did.
[539.78s -> 548.68s]  Hey, hey. Okay, hey. Oh, boy. I need to get myself some ice cream and some extra cola.
[549.40s -> 568.76s]  Hire me. I'm available. Wait, what's this? New shirt. Oh, wait. No.
[568.76s -> 584.12s]  That's definitely the best one. So this is what you do with coins, huh? Okay. How do I
[584.12s -> 592.34s]  talk to Millhouse? Hey, Millhouse. Don't you have some problems, Millhouse? Hey, here. I'll help
[592.34s -> 621.38s]  you. I'll help you. Why is he Canadian? Now let's go back. I love how it tells you. Okay.
[624.18s -> 630.30s]  I have a handbrake. Why am I playing the shittiest games?
[631.10s -> 639.08s]  Hold on. I'm going to give you a quick story. This is one of the most requested games
[640.38s -> 645.90s]  on this whole channel. I think people have been telling me to play this game
[646.46s -> 663.53s]  through messages and in chat for two years. So I, it's, come on. One guy said that. Well,
[663.53s -> 673.19s]  I have to comment on it. All right, hold on. Can you dive out of the car? No, you can't.
[682.95s -> 691.43s]  All right. You can't kill Mark. All right. I got what you need.
[704.92s -> 709.08s]  Uh, raise principal Skinner to the school and give Lisa her science project. Why do I,
[709.08s -> 715.37s]  why do I have to race the principal? Collect Lisa's science project.
[717.08s -> 725.88s]  It's all right. Drive to the school. Where's principal Skinner? Apparently I just have to
[725.88s -> 728.92s]  get there for, wait, what's that Krusty Krab thing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[728.92s -> 737.50s]  Stay on the road. Oh, there they are. Okay. That person just tried to kill me.
[739.70s -> 754.33s]  That person tried to kill me. Two out of two. How do you like it? Can I run them off the
[754.33s -> 756.70s]  road?
[765.74s -> 772.10s]  Are we going to get that all game? I think we're going to get that all game, aren't we?
[774.09s -> 777.61s]  Whoa, into the school. Wait, through what door?
[784.18s -> 795.10s]  I beat him, right? The front door. Can I, I'm inside. Oh, there you are.
[798.74s -> 802.66s]  Thanks for bringing me the model of a digestive system. Where's the garb ladder?
[819.83s -> 823.03s]  What's this? Go to Shelbyville and steal me some math books.
[824.31s -> 828.95s]  Shouldn't you be in class? Leave me alone. I'm calibrating the protractors. Oh, that's
[828.95s -> 833.35s]  the principal's office. Please, I'm busy installing asbestos right now. What? That's
[833.35s -> 851.48s]  not good. Uh, I want that one, so that's 125 points. Why would you install, install
[851.48s -> 863.14s]  asbestos in a school? Oh, I didn't know that. I thought I was moving the, I was
[863.14s -> 868.70s]  moving the fucking, I thought I was moving the bookcase. I didn't know I was pulling
[868.70s -> 887.11s]  the fire alarm. All right, let's go. Press all the actions. Are there more than one?
[887.91s -> 894.28s]  No, that's it. I got his. Go to Shelbyville and steal me some math books.
[894.92s -> 899.18s]  Oh wait, no, no. It's like a, uh, it's like a point and click adventure game.
[899.98s -> 912.65s]  You can press every button. I think that's it. There's a lot of lore. That's cool.
[913.29s -> 926.39s]  What's the dice for? Who are you? Race for wager race. Entry fee 20. Time to beat 315.
[926.39s -> 930.47s]  Best time, difficulty medium. Complete an entire lap before time runs out.
[938.89s -> 948.81s]  An entire lap. I got 60 bucks for doing this? I guess I have to do it before I can talk
[948.81s -> 958.46s]  about how I did it. This is a medium. Just don't run into anything. Just do it gently
[958.46s -> 983.91s]  and get it correct. No! I'm fine. I'm thinking, I got it. What the fuck was that? Wait, what?
[985.21s -> 990.79s]  Oh, that's not it. I thought that was a complete lap per second. Okay. Well, I don't,
[990.79s -> 996.20s]  I thought that was it. I thought that was like the end. What was that big circle?
[997.16s -> 1014.49s]  This is cool. I don't think I'm going to get it now. This car is going to explode.
[1015.13s -> 1033.16s]  I still might get it. He's going to rage a lot this stream. What? It's the Simpsons.
[1033.80s -> 1047.83s]  How can you get mad at Homer Simpson? Am I going to eat my own words in like 45 minutes?
[1048.47s -> 1065.66s]  All right, this is a little road. If I bump into anybody else, I'm going to explode.
[1065.66s -> 1076.10s]  Use the shortcuts. Uh, I think I want to just try to win the first race ever.
[1077.06s -> 1106.82s]  Is that it? Oh my god. I'm almost there. I'm really close. Come on. It's right there.
[1108.46s -> 1120.86s]  I did it. No, I didn't. What the fuck? What? I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it.
[1120.86s -> 1126.86s]  I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I got it. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. What's
[1126.86s -> 1162.02s]  in? Oh, I can do that. I can do that. I know I can do that. Because I didn't know that the
[1162.02s -> 1166.02s]  blue circle wasn't the end of the race. So I like turned around and I'd run into the wall.
[1168.89s -> 1176.84s]  You didn't use any of the shortcuts. Well, no, this car is like all fucked up. I can't do it
[1176.84s -> 1191.02s]  yet. What is this? Pay and spray? Well, I need to like drive my car into the garage.
[1199.42s -> 1232.92s]  Kick the kids into the road. Um, easy psycho. Holy shit. Ooh, how much is this? Can I like
[1232.92s -> 1243.62s]  repair this? Can you come and get me? I'll pay you in back rubs. Who did I just call to come
[1243.62s -> 1261.86s]  get me? Who just came to get me? I just called me. Well, somebody said that you can go to the
[1261.86s -> 1271.77s]  phone. I mean, I see a giant wrench. So let me pick that up. That's okay. You pick up
[1271.77s -> 1279.62s]  the giant wrench. The vibration tickling my feet. I wish I had a dog with a saddle.
[1281.75s -> 1290.25s]  All right. What do you, what do you got Marge? Oh my go talk to Ned Flanders. He seems
[1290.25s -> 1296.17s]  miffed and PO'd. Why me? I'm the world's greatest neighbor. I even have a mug to that effect.
[1299.11s -> 1306.20s]  Cone, the cone, the phone is for when the car is completely destroyed. All right, so go to
[1306.20s -> 1316.28s]  Flanders house and talk to Ned, but first I'm going to take some pizza coins. What else is
[1316.28s -> 1329.61s]  back here? There's a lot of shit back here. What is this? Buzz, a buzz card. Hmm. Uh,
[1329.61s -> 1336.54s]  okay, I just turned on the grill. What is this shit in my backyard?
[1337.26s -> 1353.54s]  I can go on the swing. No, I guess you can't go on the swing. Interesting. Okay. So I want to get up
[1353.54s -> 1364.31s]  here. Probably have to go on the roof somehow. There's probably a drop down from the roof.
[1366.09s -> 1370.17s]  There's a, okay, there's a double jump. I did not know that. Why would I know? Why would
[1370.17s -> 1386.87s]  I think there was a double jump? There's a double jump. Oh, I can tell this on the
[1386.87s -> 1412.94s]  internet. You mean I gotta get more? All right, let's go to Flanders. Please don't sue. Hey,
[1412.94s -> 1418.22s]  Flanders. All in a dither, Homer. So many of my possessions have disappeared. I called the
[1418.22s -> 1424.70s]  police to find the culprit. My lawnmower, my cooler, my lawn chair, a family portrait,
[1424.70s -> 1429.58s]  even Rod's inhaler. What kind of sick individual would take this stuff? Oh no. I borrowed
[1429.58s -> 1434.38s]  all of Flanders stuff. Quick. Think of an excuse to get out of here. Uh, excuse me. I
[1434.38s -> 1443.29s]  think I have to go shuck some corn. All right. Collect all six of Ned's lost items before the
[1443.29s -> 1450.79s]  time runs out. Get into your vehicle. So I have to go find all of Ned Flanders' stuff.
[1451.43s -> 1460.49s]  Find his tuxedo. Do I have to get out of the car? No, I don't. Okay. Find the lawnmower.
[1465.13s -> 1469.05s]  Uh, I can't, I can't talk to you right now. Whoever the fuck is calling me.
[1469.05s -> 1472.89s]  Flanders cooler. I gave it to Barney. I'm trying to pick up Flanders fucking toys.
[1476.97s -> 1492.87s]  Damn it. Fucking cell phone. Give it to me. No, give me the cooler. I gave you for your
[1492.87s -> 1497.51s]  birthday. Well, Flanders wants it back. Now what will I use for a toilet?
[1500.68s -> 1506.62s]  I need the lawn chair. Oh God. Why? We're get out of the way.
[1506.62s -> 1517.30s]  Okay. I just killed him. I don't, there's a bunch of shit. Oh, wait. I don't care about
[1517.30s -> 1524.02s]  anything else. Just give me the coins. Holy shit. That's more money than I've ever seen.
[1524.74s -> 1545.13s]  I got plenty of time. I can finally, I can buy the huge fat homer outfit. I can't wait.
[1546.52s -> 1549.80s]  Okay. Last one. Now where did I leave Rod stupid in here?
[1550.92s -> 1556.70s]  All right. That was pretty cool. What a classic game, huh?
[1557.42s -> 1563.32s]  What are the vibrations tickling my feet?
[1565.72s -> 1570.36s]  I love sensuality. I return to stuff before the cops find me sitting around talking to
[1570.36s -> 1582.87s]  myself. Before the cops? Is it the ever wanted level in this game? No, it's not.
[1582.87s -> 1588.71s]  Is there? There is. How the hell does that work?
[1594.09s -> 1598.57s]  Homer is a criminal.
[1602.98s -> 1608.74s]  Well, hi, Italy. Hello, Homer. See? Thanks, neighbor. I'm kidding. Let's not be doing
[1608.74s -> 1628.30s]  it for real. Cool. All right. Hold on. I wanted to see if I could, let me just look at
[1628.30s -> 1638.44s]  stuff. There's money everywhere. Let me just examine people's backyards. What's in
[1638.44s -> 1647.66s]  Flanders backyard? Tire swing. That's kind of cool. You get like a bunker back here?
[1648.70s -> 1666.63s]  What the hell is this? What the hell was that? Was that some camera? That was weird.
[1666.63s -> 1690.39s]  All right. I'm just gonna bank all my money. What? Is it all? I'm gonna be honest with you
[1690.39s -> 1696.87s]  guys. Now, don't take me as a bad person or an idiot or something, but
[1697.91s -> 1701.80s]  I think there's only like six episodes of The Simpsons that I've ever really actually
[1701.80s -> 1714.06s]  watched from start to finish. I don't get any of this shit. I've seen, I saw the original
[1714.06s -> 1722.07s]  Treehouse of Horror and then the episode where Maggie's a murderer. I don't know
[1722.07s -> 1738.86s]  any, I don't even know what their last name is. There's a lot of references.
[1740.25s -> 1744.57s]  Wow, I need a disco nap. Wait, what? That's it. What do you mean? That's a, that's a spoiler.
[1744.57s -> 1763.61s]  I thought that was like the thing that they all talk about every episode. What? Wait,
[1763.61s -> 1770.17s]  I, that's, this show's like 25 years old. And today's your workplace evaluation with
[1770.17s -> 1783.21s]  Mr. Smithers. Only one person can help me. Lenny. The Simpsons, The Simpsons is not like
[1783.21s -> 1797.08s]  a movie that came out last weekend. Oh my God. Did you just really spoil an episode
[1798.73s -> 1813.50s]  from 1996? I want to look around. Yeah, and guess what, guys? Ross doesn't date Phoebe.
[1814.39s -> 1839.62s]  That happens, it happened in like 94. That's not even The Simpsons. Wait, that's not The
[1839.62s -> 1858.26s]  Simpsons. I gotta talk to Lenny. Ross isn't, what if somebody was watching Friends for the
[1858.26s -> 1864.66s]  first time? I mean, Friends has been, I don't know, I'm making that up. I made
[1864.66s -> 1869.82s]  it everything up.
[1882.63s -> 1891.30s]  I completely mean you will need The Plow King. Purchases from Barney at the gasoline
[1891.30s -> 1894.98s]  station for 150 coins. Use phone boost to access vehicles you already own.
[1895.78s -> 1899.22s]  150 coins. You're killing me here.
[1908.18s -> 1910.34s]  Just don't shoot me with that dark gun.
[1912.18s -> 1920.18s]  Whatever. Holy shit. All right, that was, uh, F1 is show stats, but I don't have that in the
[1920.18s -> 1927.45s]  controller, so let's do it. Top this. Handling. Yeah. Uh, purchase it. There goes 100 hit the
[1927.45s -> 1940.12s]  coins. Destroy Smithers' car before it gets to the power plant. Get into your car. Is
[1940.20s -> 1947.74s]  there a way I can turn the camera? I feel like I can't. Is it the mouse?
[1951.74s -> 1959.78s]  All right, we got all these timed missions. God damn it. Well, this thing handles like
[1959.78s -> 1968.79s]  shit. Oh, this is hard to control. I want the pink family donut car.
[1979.06s -> 1980.34s]  All right, looking for the shortcut.
[1980.90s -> 1987.64s]  Oh, I wanted a peanut. Oh, that was not a shortcut. Or maybe it was.
[1992.73s -> 1994.17s]  All right, destroy Smithers.
[2001.19s -> 2010.06s]  Kind of have to get some speed here. Uh, look at that right there. I want to go over that.
[2010.70s -> 2027.48s]  I think I just have to ram him. Yeah. Right into the wall.
[2028.62s -> 2037.86s]  Oh, that was a lot of damage. That was a lot of damage. Perfect. He's dead. Yeah,
[2037.86s -> 2042.98s]  spoiler alert, guys. Sorry. This is where, like, you kill Smithers' best friend Smothers,
[2042.98s -> 2062.06s]  whatever his name is. Why is he still? Uh, why is he not exploded? See? Spoiler.
[2066.70s -> 2092.33s]  Streamers, Smothers, Smothers. What's that? Did I have a horn? Yeah. Spoilers. Hey, who's that?
[2093.21s -> 2105.26s]  Why does it have a money symbol? Duff truck. Oh, this guy's just, you just sell trucks.
[2107.61s -> 2116.97s]  No, I don't need anything from you right now. A lot of random people.
[2116.97s -> 2123.90s]  Cool. Jeremiah, I have not watched this part of the game yet. Please stop.
[2129.18s -> 2132.94s]  By the way, Santa. I don't even mind.
[2141.02s -> 2144.94s]  Is this a blind run? Yeah.
[2150.20s -> 2154.76s]  Go to the gas station. Get me some of those cardboard tubes. You know them.
[2154.76s -> 2159.48s]  I'm gonna build me some indoor plumbing. When you finish with that, knock down all
[2159.48s -> 2163.24s]  them tobacco plants so the youngins can clean them up for market.
[2166.71s -> 2171.99s]  Find cardboard tubes and collect the tobacco harvest for Cletus in under 230.
[2174.23s -> 2177.27s]  Get into your vehicle. This is not the kind of car I think I need for this.
[2177.27s -> 2181.91s]  That's the kind of car that I need for this. That one right there.
[2184.23s -> 2196.63s]  Can you drop it off? Actually, that'd be all right. I snuck through there. I'm good.
[2219.66s -> 2224.78s]  Where are you trying to get me to rip around? That guy's got low gravity on.
[2224.78s -> 2227.50s]  That guy's flying around through space. I had nothing to do with that.
[2228.46s -> 2239.14s]  Through here. This thing is so slow. Can I break through this?
[2244.89s -> 2250.81s]  Oh my god. That's not a shortcut. Okay, I can't just like break through the doors.
[2259.56s -> 2261.56s]  I see this. You get points for this.
[2265.98s -> 2272.92s]  One minute to... that was a school bus.
[2276.04s -> 2276.68s]  Is this a shortcut?
[2276.68s -> 2307.42s]  Why is that on fire? Shortcut? Collect the... Oh, I have 25 seconds to get this shit.
[2308.38s -> 2311.54s]  Should I get out of the car? I'm getting out.
[2329.06s -> 2333.74s]  Oh! That... no, that's not it. What? Oh my god.
[2348.07s -> 2353.27s]  Holy shit. I need another car. Yeah, I can't do it with this fucking thing.
[2353.99s -> 2356.95s]  How do I get it? I gotta like... I gotta... how do I just cancel this?
[2360.52s -> 2364.47s]  You just steal cars? You can actually just steal a car.
[2368.09s -> 2380.26s]  What? I didn't think this was possible either. Wait, what? You can steal cars?
[2385.14s -> 2393.90s]  It's actually just GTA. All right, well how do I restart this?
[2402.22s -> 2408.54s]  Homer really is a fucking criminal. Well, now I got the school... oh, I blocked off the road. Hold on.
[2409.66s -> 2413.82s]  I mean, this is worse than I'm in the school bus. Actually, the school bus is probably a little
[2413.82s -> 2427.22s]  bit faster. I made it on my own roadblock. I think I can still get it. I think I'll be all
[2427.22s -> 2434.78s]  right. Don't get out of the car. As long as I get back there with like two minutes.
[2434.78s -> 2439.18s]  Well, that's why... that's what happens when you look at the chat for no reason.
[2439.18s -> 2445.58s]  All right, give me a better car. I'm gonna restart it with a better car.
[2454.07s -> 2463.34s]  Come here. Telephone. Uh, damage. Four percent. Thank you. All right, this is my real car.
[2467.53s -> 2479.50s]  All right, let's go. Homer Simpson did his own mocap for this game.
[2481.18s -> 2499.29s]  Really? That's interesting. That is pretty interesting. All right, nice and easy.
[2501.02s -> 2524.62s]  Oh, come on. What the hell? I had to go over that lip? Back there. I'll get it. As long
[2524.62s -> 2542.42s]  as I get back there with about a minute left. I love how I looked over at chat and the first
[2542.42s -> 2547.98s]  thing I see is stop looking at chat. This is the right way. I remember I went through this.
[2552.01s -> 2553.29s]  All right, now I gotta get this right.
[2554.25s -> 2567.30s]  Don't read this. Oh my god. I can't help myself. I didn't even get the bonus.
[2568.10s -> 2586.63s]  What does this mean? All right, I got it. I got it. I got it.
[2594.33s -> 2599.96s]  Here are the cops that show up. Too much heat apparently.
[2604.78s -> 2616.30s]  27 seconds. I'll make it. I'm almost there. All right, I brought it back. Hello Cletus.
[2620.86s -> 2627.34s]  Boy, I'll help you. You just yell into one of those magic talk boxes and I come a running.
[2627.34s -> 2634.70s]  Oh man, them things is crazy. Bonus mission complete. Congratulations, you've unlocked
[2634.70s -> 2651.61s]  Cletus's pickup truck. Go to a phone booth to use it. Oh nice. Does Bart Simpson drive in
[2651.61s -> 2669.78s]  this game? No, they wouldn't do that, right? Bart Simpson drives in this game. Okay,
[2669.78s -> 2678.94s]  uh, let's try that. Let's try the new car. Wow, I need a disco nap. Pickup truck.
[2679.74s -> 2690.76s]  Toughness handling speed acceleration. This thing sucks. This is just a shitty plow cane.
[2693.35s -> 2698.63s]  Can you come and get me? I'll pay you in back rubs. Yeah, I'll give you a ride.
[2698.63s -> 2706.04s]  The back seat's swarming with chiggers though. Wait, he's gonna...
[2706.84s -> 2727.56s]  I'm not driving. Wait, it's, I'm him now. That's kind of cool. Look at that 180 degree neck turn.
[2728.44s -> 2738.82s]  Just put some butter on the wound. It'll be fine. Yeah, I'm just hitchhiking right now.
[2738.82s -> 2747.51s]  That's that. That's really cool. All right, let me get this this time.
[2749.50s -> 2755.50s]  Got it. That was better than the booby box. I still have to turn on this power plant mission.
[2759.93s -> 2763.21s]  That was easy as pie. Wait, that was supposed to be a race?
[2767.11s -> 2771.27s]  My car's allowed in here? Vengeance will be mine. What the fuck?
[2772.71s -> 2779.13s]  Holy shit. Okay, this is freaking me out. Hold on. You got real purty acceleration.
[2789.46s -> 2792.62s]  I need to get out of this car.
[2794.58s -> 2808.54s]  Take that! All right, Homer's workstation. Thanks for the ride. Almost got it. Yeah.
[2809.18s -> 2817.10s]  Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this button do? Well, I hope do not press means press
[2817.10s -> 2827.24s]  right away. Well, now you got me all fucked up because this is, this probably sound like a
[2827.24s -> 2848.41s]  secret chest up here or something. Yeah, ain't gonna fuck me up. All that for what, one coin?
[2849.29s -> 2861.66s]  Oops, I gotta change that button. Jump can't be B. I mean, run can't be B.
[2865.59s -> 2869.99s]  Because I have to like turn my hand around and do B and A to jump. I gotta change that to,
[2869.99s -> 2881.85s]  what the hell, X maybe? B attack? Yeah, that makes more sense. Yeah, attack would be,
[2881.85s -> 2890.84s]  should be B. Jump should be A. Sprint should be X. Get in is Y. Okay, that's better. Plug
[2890.84s -> 2896.58s]  in a controller. That's what I'm playing with. I'm playing with the controller right now. Yeah,
[2896.58s -> 2904.07s]  that feels better. That feels more correct. And I keep forgetting about the double jump.
[2904.07s -> 2908.33s]  It's all right. All right, here we go. Wait, I want to look around Homer's station.
[2908.49s -> 2925.86s]  Oh, am I breathing in these fumes and getting going crazy? I don't get it.
[2927.21s -> 2942.74s]  Destroy all the power couplings before time runs out. What? What is this? Hold on. I just killed
[2942.74s -> 2957.53s]  somebody. Destroy all the... No, this is going to suck absolute ass.
[2969.14s -> 2981.32s]  This is going to be real bad, but no, I'll get it. What does stupid like a fox mean?
[2982.82s -> 2989.29s]  Did you hear how low that was? Stupid like a fox mean. No, I got it. I'm good.
[2989.77s -> 2994.89s]  If you're so smart, how come I broke it? I got stuck on that. I got fucking clipped on that.
[2995.45s -> 3016.06s]  Sorry, I got a ton of time. Like anyone likes these things. Stupid like a fox. All right,
[3016.06s -> 3028.65s]  I got it. Whoa. Whoa, where are we going? Buzzkill on the blades or over the railing?
[3033.38s -> 3051.06s]  Uh, just walk on a blade? Oh, now I have to get that though. That was a little bit
[3052.42s -> 3060.10s]  a little bit hard to do. I think I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I get it.
[3060.10s -> 3080.10s]  I get it. I get it. Jump from the blades. Yeah, maybe I can make it like this.
[3090.38s -> 3093.02s]  My bikini zone's chafing. Try it one more time.
[3107.24s -> 3112.20s]  Just go. I want to just get the thing. All right, when you were playing Simpson's Hit and Run
[3112.20s -> 3115.40s]  and you saw like a little secret here and it was kind of tricky to jump to get it,
[3115.40s -> 3130.09s]  did you give up after two times? See? Like, why would I do that? I got it.
[3154.26s -> 3158.26s]  Drive to the Simpsons house. Wait, is there anything? Can I look at stuff in the office?
[3164.71s -> 3172.06s]  Is it a bug farm? I can't interact with anything else in Homer's office.
[3173.67s -> 3196.49s]  There's no fall damage. No, not in Hit and Run. No, now I'm in trouble. Okay, I see.
[3203.83s -> 3209.34s]  Uh, I can't drive up this. I had to get some momentum.
[3214.84s -> 3220.42s]  263? That's not bad. All right, back to the house.
[3224.92s -> 3230.46s]  Our safe direct. Seven days since the last accident. Actually, none considering that I just
[3230.46s -> 3246.52s]  melted somebody in there. Watch that meter. Yeah, I do need to keep my eye on the meter.
[3246.52s -> 3266.31s]  You're right. That's the urine trouble meter. I want to give it to me. There is a card back
[3266.31s -> 3285.54s]  here. So what do these do? Mr. Sparkle Box. There's also something to do here. Yeah,
[3285.54s -> 3298.98s]  there's a lot of, like, random shit to do. Get them all. Get all the cards. I don't think I'm
[3298.98s -> 3315.16s]  gonna do that. It's a pointless collectible. Didn't he say he could sell them? All right,
[3315.16s -> 3323.18s]  I want to get rid of this car. All right, give me a phone. I want my other car back.
[3323.18s -> 3325.26s]  If I'm gonna do a race, I need to have my other car.
[3327.35s -> 3331.88s]  I need your help.
[3336.36s -> 3349.93s]  Kill Millhouse. You can't kill anybody in this game. Why would I do that? All right,
[3349.93s -> 3354.25s]  let's do it. What are you doing here? Patty and Selma won't give me a license to ride
[3354.25s -> 3360.78s]  a bike without safety wheels. Unless I run the driving tests. Reach the finish line
[3360.78s -> 3370.49s]  before time runs out. Don't destroy your vehicle. Five laps. Oh, they really like
[3370.49s -> 3379.91s]  to throw these at you. This is a drift map. Am I actually gonna be able to do five laps here?
[3388.22s -> 3392.06s]  Maybe, but I don't know. That's gonna be close. There can't be any mistakes.
[3404.65s -> 3411.53s]  No! Oh, I'm actually, I'm so mad right now. I'm actually fucking angry. Oh, slow down. Easy,
[3411.53s -> 3420.55s]  Jeremy. What the fuck was that? I went from, like, a zero to a fucking thousand.
[3420.71s -> 3432.28s]  I can just break the damn tree. It was going so well, too. I still get it.
[3434.09s -> 3440.71s]  The scale is just tipped. Somebody put, like, four weights on the other side.
[3443.30s -> 3451.42s]  I almost didn't hit it. This is something I rest in. I'm going to feed your driver's license
[3451.42s -> 3467.50s]  to Jub-Jub. Everyone sucks but me. What do I get for that? Nothing. Apparently nothing.
[3471.86s -> 3474.66s]  That's what Homer wanted to do all season four, right?
[3483.72s -> 3491.00s]  Spoiler. Oh, please. Don't even. That's not a spoiler. There's no such thing as a spoiler.
[3491.72s -> 3504.97s]  I mean, there is, but not in this context. Wait, cross to the crab. Nice. Complete all
[3504.97s -> 3522.54s]  three races. Well, when they pop up, I'll do them. Homer wasn't introduced until season six.
[3526.55s -> 3528.23s]  Do I get to, can I drive around his grandpa?
[3576.84s -> 3580.76s]  What? Uh, investigate and follow the black van. Don't let it get away.
[3580.76s -> 3600.25s]  Do this thing. That was comedy, apparently. Follow the black van. Let's go. Uh, I'm assuming
[3600.25s -> 3611.42s]  that's the meter at the top is don't fill that, otherwise mission failed. Fucking escort
[3611.42s -> 3632.26s]  mission. They put these in this goddamn game. Fill it. Why would I fill it? Isn't that the
[3632.26s -> 3639.75s]  meter that is, hey, don't get that close. You're too close, Homer. I know what that
[3639.75s -> 3662.01s]  meter is. I've played a GTA game before. All right. School bus. What are you doing?
[3669.69s -> 3673.61s]  No, I'm not going to get baited from chat for the 4,000th time.
[3674.89s -> 3678.17s]  To fill the meter, get up real close and have it be like, oh,
[3703.93s -> 3722.92s]  nuclear power plant heading into the power plant. What are you doing in here? Spy van.
[3725.99s -> 3731.48s]  Did that just drive off the edge? No. Okay. All right. All right.
[3745.05s -> 3777.21s]  No, too close, too close, too close. Does that hurt me? Shit. No, wait, wait. I hit the car
[3777.21s -> 3784.82s]  stuck. Wait, give me a car. Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus.
[3784.82s -> 3821.06s]  Yes. What? I did it. Okay. I did it. I tailed him for long enough so that I could get the
[3821.06s -> 3838.26s]  information. Get rocket. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rocket car. Why is everybody freaking out?
[3838.26s -> 3847.56s]  Rocket car. Rocket car. Get rocket car. You want me to get this? Okay. Is this secret?
[3852.39s -> 3862.60s]  I love to sit. How does this work? Mistakes were made. Do I get this forever now? I'm dead.
[3862.60s -> 3873.42s]  I almost spilled my sundae. This thing's already going to explode. I forgot my mission.
[3875.75s -> 3887.16s]  Oh, that just startled me. That thing sucks. Pick it up here, people. This is really fast.
[3887.16s -> 3891.48s]  But, oh, do the, oh, I should have hit the rocket car for this, right? I know you.
[3891.48s -> 3896.52s]  You're the kid that sells me bootleg CDs on the street corner. Yeah, well, I've been having some
[3896.52s -> 3901.88s]  legal problems lately, so I'm stuck running these races for the DMV. It was this or read to the
[3901.88s -> 3909.51s]  elderly. Probably all laps and finish the race in first place. Don't destroy the vehicle.
[3910.39s -> 3916.63s]  Oh, no, I do have the car. How do I do this without blowing up the car?
[3921.10s -> 3928.34s]  This is not going to happen. All right, here's my plan. My plan is to be very careful
[3928.34s -> 3936.12s]  and then go punch it as hard as I can on the last lap. I'm just going to hold down right
[3936.12s -> 3946.20s]  trigger. Holy shit. They're so dumb. Okay, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm going to punch it.
[3946.20s -> 3948.60s]  He doesn't matter. He can tow the fuck out of me if he wants.
[3948.60s -> 3959.06s]  Oh, no, I don't. I can't do that.
[3978.38s -> 3981.02s]  This is not going to work. It's not going to work with this thing.
[3985.91s -> 4000.17s]  I need another car. There's no way I can do it in that. No, no, don't retry the mission.
[4000.25s -> 4010.82s]  Give me a new car. I'll do it again. There he is. He's crusty.
[4019.61s -> 4033.91s]  That was brutal. That was brutal. Now I'm ready. I was about to win.
[4034.79s -> 4037.74s]  Was I though? Hold on. There's a button to press.
[4037.74s -> 4043.29s]  Yeah, crystal eggs in the crotch. Who lives here?
[4059.66s -> 4067.27s]  Cool. Secret. Watch this. Nice. There we go. All right, I'm ready.
[4077.14s -> 4081.85s]  I mean, it still starts in three, two, one anyways. So why does that matter? All right,
[4081.85s -> 4102.81s]  I'll get it. Just going to stay in first place. Go around the lap here. All right, I got it.
[4110.34s -> 4115.94s]  Just drive normal. You don't have to do any crazy moves. This is race number two out of three,
[4115.94s -> 4132.55s]  right? And then once I do race three, I get the secret costume, right? You get a car. Oh,
[4132.55s -> 4135.67s]  okay. This guy's going to run up my ass though. I got to punch it.
[4143.91s -> 4147.19s]  He's right up my ass. He did crash into the wall.
[4156.17s -> 4166.94s]  He's going to say that a thousand more times. He's going to say that so many more times.
[4168.06s -> 4184.52s]  Two, four, six, eight. Over here. Here we go. Great. This is it. Last wrap around. Oh, smooth.
[4186.62s -> 4201.16s]  Very smooth. Don't lose it here. Come on. Did it not know what place I was just in?
[4201.16s -> 4209.16s]  This is terrible. I'm going to drown my sorrows at the golden banana. I am so smart. I am so smart.
[4209.80s -> 4218.86s]  S-M-R-T. I mean, S-M-A-R-T. How did you guys know that? You guys have played this game before?
[4219.66s -> 4226.90s]  I'm surprised at how many people have actually played this game. That's very surprising to
[4226.90s -> 4233.30s]  me. It's from the TV show. Yeah, but how did you know it was going to be right there?
[4238.55s -> 4243.06s]  Ouch. My bikini zone's chafing. I just want to look around.
[4245.94s -> 4250.57s]  Okay, I got to take a car up here because I'm going to blast through that.
[4251.29s -> 4254.89s]  All right, give me my car. How do I get up there? How do I get up here?
[4256.12s -> 4264.65s]  Okay, I got to go around there. Why is everybody part of the power plant?
[4267.46s -> 4282.73s]  They just walk around? Should I be in one of those suits? Oh, this guy's driving the car.
[4282.73s -> 4308.55s]  I didn't steal the car. Why? Okay, hold on. I'll get it. Damn it.
[4315.46s -> 4319.38s]  I got to go back further. I'm going to start from over here.
[4324.74s -> 4327.46s]  Holy fuck. Look at that. Whoa. Hold on. I'll get that later.
[4343.85s -> 4347.69s]  I just overshot the hell out of it. I need to get the help.
[4351.05s -> 4369.50s]  Did that guy just die? Did that guy dead? I might be able to get over this.
[4370.46s -> 4380.74s]  I got to go off the right way though. No! Why did I?
[4400.66s -> 4404.26s]  I died. I died. I did it. Didn't I do it? That was offshoot?
[4405.94s -> 4416.94s]  I need the rocket car, but it's an invisible wall. There's nothing up there. Oh.
[4419.74s -> 4433.05s]  Watch it. Well, let's do a mission. That was a jump. How would you break that one? Other side?
[4435.56s -> 4445.99s]  All right. Talk to Marge. But first, hold on. Wait. I love that sound.
[4446.55s -> 4452.30s]  That coin collection sound is perfect. We've got to follow him. Not now, Homer. A new violent
[4452.30s -> 4457.02s]  video game has hit the streets and we need to get rid of it before it warps any children
[4457.02s -> 4463.34s]  with its bloops and bleeps. But that game sounds awesome and therefore should be destroyed.
[4463.42s -> 4467.78s]  I get it. Hit the delivery truck and collect the
[4467.78s -> 4472.50s]  bone storm games before time runs out. Everyone better stay out of my way.
[4472.50s -> 4479.19s]  Oh, it's Marge. Hit the delivery truck and collect 10 copies. Well, that's the truck.
[4489.19s -> 4493.51s]  Marge, you sure do care about children. You're running over a lot of them.
[4501.35s -> 4503.75s]  You really just have to sit right here and just pop it a couple times.
[4503.75s -> 4517.08s]  That hitbox is not that big currently. Just wait for it to spawn.
[4518.84s -> 4526.89s]  Easing. It's not that hard. You just have to be patient.
[4529.93s -> 4538.89s]  Just tap it. Break. That wasn't enough. I'm not sure how.
[4546.38s -> 4549.26s]  Last one. Do I have to do something else? There's always like a part two
[4549.26s -> 4559.62s]  in this game. It seems like. No. Sell the copies to G2A.
[4562.18s -> 4563.14s]  Now that's topical.
[4563.94s -> 4568.95s]  Well Homer, I am evil.
[4568.95s -> 4570.95s]  Where am I going to put all these?
[4570.95s -> 4571.51s]  What happened?
[4571.51s -> 4575.27s]  If only kids would play more video games about sharing.
[4575.27s -> 4580.23s]  Marge, you know I have four crazy plans. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go spy on my boss.
[4584.70s -> 4587.90s]  This is what happened to my Amazon package. Drive to the power plant.
[4587.90s -> 4595.82s]  Not yet. Where's the other race? Give me the phone.
[4595.82s -> 4599.69s]  I want to explore around. I don't want to just blow through.
[4600.49s -> 4608.84s]  Can you come and get me? I'll pay you in back rubs.
[4613.34s -> 4615.98s]  Blow through the game? No, why would I do that?
[4616.70s -> 4619.38s]  I don't want to blow through the game.
[4623.94s -> 4629.72s]  All right. What's this? I want to go in people's backyards and
[4630.44s -> 4635.34s]  I want to find the other race. Because there's another car I can get, right?
[4636.14s -> 4644.76s]  I did not explore. And that's why you gotta take a minute sometimes.
[4644.76s -> 4647.24s]  Because there is a collectible Pokemon card up there.
[4648.28s -> 4653.90s]  How do I get that? There's a huge jump. All right. Just wait. Relax.
[4666.50s -> 4671.67s]  That didn't really do anything.
[4673.83s -> 4675.43s]  Not going fast enough? Or was it? Was that?
[4678.47s -> 4681.19s]  I missed the sign. I gotta go through the sign.
[4681.19s -> 4683.19s]  Aye. Okay, hold on. I'll get it.
[4683.91s -> 4688.20s]  Let me line it up. Where's the sign?
[4689.00s -> 4692.60s]  It's right, right there.
[4692.60s -> 4707.86s]  It doesn't do anything. It doesn't do anything.
[4712.28s -> 4719.96s]  So let me just platform. Let me look around for a place to jump.
[4721.11s -> 4734.97s]  There's some stuff over here. From here to here?
[4735.69s -> 4737.88s]  Come on, camera. Turn around.
[4753.51s -> 4763.06s]  All right. Now what? Is that it?
[4763.06s -> 4765.53s]  Oh, don't fall off. That's it.
[4772.46s -> 4773.26s]  You're on the wrong roof.
[4773.90s -> 4778.33s]  Oh, the clicking mark's over there.
[4793.34s -> 4795.82s]  Oh, I hope do not press means press right away.
[4796.86s -> 4800.41s]  So now can I, can I make this jump from?
[4800.41s -> 4802.01s]  Holy fuck. I didn't even see it.
[4815.10s -> 4819.58s]  Very nice. Oh, look at these pog champs.
[4821.34s -> 4823.10s]  That was too easy. Whoa.
[4823.98s -> 4828.95s]  Where am I? Well, got it.
[4828.95s -> 4836.54s]  Does this do anything? Don't do that.
[4836.54s -> 4837.42s]  Wait, there's another gas.
[4844.47s -> 4845.67s]  I gotta spend some money. I got a lot.
[4845.67s -> 4849.10s]  Oh, I'm going to the donut boy, right? Donut guy.
[4854.78s -> 4855.34s]  I jumped it.
[4864.52s -> 4868.76s]  Oh shit. Oh, can I get on his head?
[4873.19s -> 4878.36s]  I don't think I can do anything about this.
[4878.36s -> 4879.40s]  I could just hang out here.
[4880.20s -> 4885.46s]  Itchy and scratchy over there.
[4891.10s -> 4894.04s]  You won the game. Sometimes.
[4897.11s -> 4898.55s]  Run. Again.
[4901.86s -> 4903.30s]  ADHD stream.
[4904.02s -> 4906.74s]  Well, I wanted to take a look around for a second, get some money and.
[4907.54s -> 4909.54s]  Hey, I found my lost nachos.
[4909.54s -> 4910.98s]  Actually, you know, I want to buy that costume.
[4913.06s -> 4914.10s]  I have money. I'm buying it.
[4914.74s -> 4940.10s]  What do you have that is high in both bet and alcohol content?
[4940.10s -> 4943.06s]  I'm so glad you came. If I don't increase profits.
[4943.06s -> 4944.10s]  I just broke his machine.
[4947.11s -> 4948.15s]  Oh, I'll just ruin it.
[4953.42s -> 4954.86s]  Did I just get arrested?
[4955.58s -> 4959.98s]  Did I just steal a bunch of money from the fucking ATM?
[4960.70s -> 4966.52s]  What is that? Wait, hold on. I thought I could play it.
[4967.16s -> 4970.89s]  I just skipped the cut scene because I thought I was playing the game.
[4988.81s -> 4991.13s]  Restart the whole. There we go. There we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[4991.13s -> 4991.69s]  Let's watch it.
[4992.49s -> 5005.98s]  Holy shit. Was this game rated?
[5005.98s -> 5013.11s]  Can I take the duff truck?
[5013.11s -> 5016.74s]  Right, I want that.
[5023.66s -> 5026.46s]  Interesting platforming. Coming right up.
[5026.46s -> 5031.21s]  There's another one of these.
[5031.21s -> 5032.73s]  Ooh, from here to there?
[5032.73s -> 5034.17s]  Like I can make it from here over there.
[5034.89s -> 5041.02s]  This thing gives so much money.
[5046.18s -> 5048.26s]  Oops. Okay. No, you can do that. It's fine.
[5048.26s -> 5048.82s]  Doesn't hurt you.
[5051.53s -> 5058.78s]  All right, let's go. Let's move on.
[5063.66s -> 5065.26s]  Holy fuck Homer is strong.
[5065.98s -> 5080.36s]  This car is fast. This is just screaming by.
[5088.26s -> 5089.22s]  Do the final race.
[5090.84s -> 5095.66s]  Where is it? I haven't seen it pop up on the minimap.
[5097.18s -> 5102.44s]  I have to go to the church.
[5102.44s -> 5123.74s]  Oops. We're good. It's on two wheels.
[5124.78s -> 5129.24s]  I keep going that way. I have not driven down this road once.
[5130.12s -> 5131.06s]  Did that one.
[5131.78s -> 5136.89s]  I don't really know where the church is.
[5137.77s -> 5141.03s]  I'll have to stumble upon it after this mission.
[5147.02s -> 5147.42s]  Fine.
[5149.77s -> 5150.73s]  That's so unfortunate.
[5161.82s -> 5168.38s]  Carl. Hi Carl.
[5174.22s -> 5186.86s]  This is the last mission of the game?
[5186.86s -> 5187.66s]  Oh no, it is not.
[5188.46s -> 5190.78s]  Beat Smithers to Mr. Burns Mansion.
[5200.78s -> 5201.26s]  Sorry.
[5201.90s -> 5210.38s]  I like the car though.
[5210.38s -> 5211.90s]  It's got the perfect handling.
[5211.90s -> 5213.02s]  Perfect safety features.
[5218.17s -> 5222.30s]  Ooh, almost flipped the whole thing.
[5224.92s -> 5230.31s]  Oh, he cheated too.
[5232.07s -> 5233.67s]  Fuck. I didn't know they do the cheats.
[5246.47s -> 5247.35s]  Move out of the way.
[5249.19s -> 5250.79s]  He's got to stay in front of him.
[5250.79s -> 5253.14s]  He's going to get stuck right there.
[5253.14s -> 5254.42s]  Good. Perfect.
[5255.14s -> 5258.46s]  There's not enough room on the road for both of us.
[5258.46s -> 5259.34s]  Should I go straight through?
[5260.30s -> 5260.86s]  Straight through?
[5263.13s -> 5263.63s]  Yep.
[5265.30s -> 5267.14s]  Oh, I just fucked him up so bad.
[5268.10s -> 5271.32s]  I just ruined everything for you.
[5274.50s -> 5275.14s]  Don't pass me.
[5275.86s -> 5289.88s]  I don't know where to go.
[5289.88s -> 5291.80s]  I don't watch this TV show.
[5292.84s -> 5293.32s]  I don't.
[5293.32s -> 5295.16s]  Oh, I don't watch this show.
[5295.72s -> 5296.52s]  I would have known.
[5297.40s -> 5301.32s]  You stupid asshole.
[5328.95s -> 5340.18s]  Oh, come on.
[5346.50s -> 5347.22s]  I had it too.
[5347.22s -> 5348.42s]  Right at the end, I cut him off.
[5349.22s -> 5353.51s]  But this car, just look at this car.
[5354.87s -> 5356.63s]  What a piece of crap this car is.
[5357.43s -> 5358.55s]  What a piece of crap.
[5359.43s -> 5363.42s]  I almost didn't make it.
[5363.42s -> 5365.18s]  Well, I am destroying him right now.
[5365.18s -> 5365.90s]  What is he doing?
[5371.96s -> 5373.16s]  And I didn't even go through the...
[5373.16s -> 5375.64s]  Oh, I just cracked my neck like in 50 places.
[5384.25s -> 5394.70s]  Just trying to cut corners.
[5396.86s -> 5398.54s]  How many school buses are here?
[5399.42s -> 5402.73s]  He just hit that.
[5402.73s -> 5403.23s]  Good.
[5406.62s -> 5407.26s]  I've got itchy.
[5407.26s -> 5408.14s]  My whole body is itchy.
[5411.11s -> 5411.75s]  Oh my god.
[5411.75s -> 5413.11s]  My whole fucking body is itching.
[5419.05s -> 5419.77s]  That just helped him.
[5420.81s -> 5421.37s]  Unbelievable.
[5435.86s -> 5437.46s]  That same motherfucker right there.
[5437.46s -> 5438.50s]  It was the same guy.
[5439.30s -> 5440.58s]  It was the same guy.
[5443.83s -> 5444.33s]  No.
[5447.37s -> 5448.49s]  I still got it.
[5448.49s -> 5449.29s]  I still got it.
[5452.81s -> 5453.93s]  Where am I going?
[5457.61s -> 5458.57s]  Holy shit.
[5465.80s -> 5466.36s]  I beat him.
[5467.00s -> 5468.49s]  Did I win?
[5470.26s -> 5470.76s]  I won.
[5492.50s -> 5493.86s]  Final cutscene of the game.
[5508.42s -> 5509.62s]  First try, Eddie.
[5515.22s -> 5516.42s]  I thought I just failed the mission.
[5521.27s -> 5522.79s]  My heart just sank into my stomach.
[5523.51s -> 5531.06s]  Bonus mission.
[5531.06s -> 5532.10s]  Street races two to three.
[5532.10s -> 5533.06s]  Collector cards.
[5533.06s -> 5533.86s]  Character clothing.
[5533.86s -> 5534.74s]  Vehicles.
[5534.74s -> 5535.86s]  Wasp cameras.
[5535.86s -> 5536.36s]  Gags.
[5537.78s -> 5540.46s]  Did I beat it?
[5552.39s -> 5552.95s]  No, I didn't.
[5558.23s -> 5559.91s]  Oh, now I get to play as Bart.
[5566.14s -> 5567.26s]  This is a different place.
[5568.14s -> 5569.90s]  This is like the 20 years in the future.
[5573.27s -> 5573.77s]  She baited.
[5574.63s -> 5577.58s]  Ooh, what's this?
[5578.22s -> 5579.18s]  I want to look around.
[5584.86s -> 5586.22s]  Hey, that's great.
[5586.22s -> 5587.74s]  You better get out of here, Bart.
[5587.74s -> 5590.94s]  Principal Skinner's looking for everyone that skipped school today.
[5590.94s -> 5593.50s]  And when you're caught, it's expulsion, Bart.
[5593.50s -> 5594.54s]  Expulsion!
[5596.60s -> 5597.96s]  Avoid Principal Skinner.
[5597.96s -> 5600.76s]  Drive to the try and save before time runs out.
[5600.76s -> 5603.24s]  Bart Simpson at your service.
[5603.24s -> 5605.08s]  I guess I'm going into the rocket car.
[5606.74s -> 5609.46s]  And this is a, like, seven-year-old driving a car.
[5610.34s -> 5618.57s]  I'll get you, Bart.
[5618.57s -> 5620.41s]  Just like I got Charlie and Nam.
[5620.41s -> 5621.21s]  Braid not.
[5621.21s -> 5622.09s]  Braid so.
[5622.09s -> 5622.49s]  Braid not.
[5622.49s -> 5623.05s]  Don't let him.
[5623.05s -> 5623.61s]  Braid so?
[5623.61s -> 5627.37s]  Do you stand your lightning fast with fire in the hole?
[5627.37s -> 5628.25s]  Ah, this is...
[5629.13s -> 5632.36s]  This is a grown man trying to drive into a kid in a go-kart.
[5646.86s -> 5648.38s]  Does that just avoid him for a minute?
[5649.02s -> 5651.83s]  I'm doing a pretty good job avoiding.
[5653.62s -> 5655.22s]  Smell you later, stinky gator.
[5655.22s -> 5656.42s]  The Bartman knows all.
[5658.68s -> 5659.40s]  The Bartman.
[5667.10s -> 5667.90s]  Empty the bar.
[5669.46s -> 5670.50s]  What do you mean, empty the bar?
[5671.96s -> 5673.00s]  Easy peasy.
[5673.80s -> 5678.12s]  Easily.
[5678.12s -> 5678.76s]  Wait, free stop.
[5678.76s -> 5679.40s]  Oh, awesome!
[5679.40s -> 5685.02s]  Here, the money carries over to the next, uh, next land.
[5685.98s -> 5687.66s]  Too late, losers.
[5687.66s -> 5689.42s]  I got the last game.
[5689.42s -> 5691.02s]  Four-finger discount.
[5692.14s -> 5694.78s]  Some crazy lady destroyed all the rest.
[5694.78s -> 5695.90s]  When will they learn?
[5695.90s -> 5697.42s]  Video games don't kill people.
[5697.42s -> 5698.78s]  They just kill their minds.
[5699.66s -> 5701.34s]  And the crowd goes wild.
[5705.67s -> 5706.95s]  Drive to Herman's.
[5707.99s -> 5710.06s]  I want to get in the thing.
[5717.96s -> 5718.28s]  Home.
[5719.61s -> 5720.17s]  Oh, God.
[5720.97s -> 5722.41s]  Okay, I thought I just did that.
[5722.41s -> 5724.01s]  I thought I just kicked him into it and blew it up.
[5727.16s -> 5731.83s]  This sucks!
[5731.83s -> 5732.47s]  Hey!
[5732.47s -> 5733.27s]  What do you got for me?
[5734.07s -> 5734.63s]  It's me, Bart!
[5734.63s -> 5736.07s]  How am I gonna get that new game?
[5736.07s -> 5736.63s]  Who cares?
[5736.63s -> 5737.03s]  That was a gag.
[5737.03s -> 5739.19s]  Video games are so late 90s.
[5739.19s -> 5741.99s]  Illegal fireworks are all the rave now.
[5741.99s -> 5744.87s]  Better make it snappy though if you want to be part of this trend.
[5747.64s -> 5750.04s]  A lot of self-referential video game.
[5750.04s -> 5751.88s]  Video games are bad referentials.
[5752.68s -> 5756.06s]  Collect fireworks from around Springfield before time runs out.
[5756.06s -> 5757.18s]  Fine by me!
[5757.18s -> 5762.44s]  For some road made.
[5762.44s -> 5763.96s]  I only have 60 seconds to do this.
[5767.38s -> 5768.42s]  That's not a way to turn.
[5769.06s -> 5782.82s]  These people are jumping.
[5782.82s -> 5784.42s]  They're just jumping into the...
[5784.42s -> 5785.06s]  I don't know.
[5785.06s -> 5785.70s]  I'm not doing that.
[5785.70s -> 5786.10s]  They are.
[5786.66s -> 5787.86s]  It's right over two people's heads.
[5788.74s -> 5795.00s]  There's the car wash.
[5795.00s -> 5796.92s]  No, don't tell me to go that way.
[5796.92s -> 5797.56s]  It's right here.
[5799.35s -> 5800.07s]  Oh, hey, Otto.
[5814.84s -> 5815.80s]  All right, got it.
[5815.80s -> 5816.44s]  Enter Moe's.
[5816.44s -> 5817.32s]  I do have to...
[5817.32s -> 5818.36s]  Am I gonna prank call him?
[5819.08s -> 5826.52s]  Can I interact with any of this stuff?
[5827.32s -> 5831.53s]  I can't jump.
[5833.18s -> 5833.58s]  I'm gonna...
[5833.58s -> 5834.22s]  Can I call him?
[5834.94s -> 5835.90s]  That's the joke, right?
[5839.43s -> 5841.51s]  Drink at the bar as Bart.
[5841.51s -> 5842.31s]  Sorry, Bart.
[5842.31s -> 5843.91s]  I can't serve booze to a miner.
[5843.91s -> 5844.47s]  It ain't right.
[5844.47s -> 5845.75s]  I'm here to buy fireworks.
[5845.75s -> 5846.39s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[5851.90s -> 5853.10s]  No problemo.
[5858.38s -> 5858.86s]  D...
[5858.86s -> 5859.74s]  D-jar?
[5859.74s -> 5859.98s]  Oh.
[5866.57s -> 5867.45s]  I won.
[5867.45s -> 5869.34s]  What do I get?
[5871.78s -> 5872.50s]  One coin.
[5872.50s -> 5872.98s]  Do it again.
[5878.47s -> 5880.79s]  That was the coolest thing I've seen anybody do in the game.
[5880.79s -> 5882.31s]  He just did a full backflip.
[5882.31s -> 5882.79s]  No hands.
[5898.95s -> 5899.75s]  Cold fish.
[5900.31s -> 5900.79s]  One more.
[5901.43s -> 5903.98s]  Get it again.
[5904.54s -> 5906.62s]  I'm pretty good at this.
[5908.86s -> 5910.14s]  Why is there a mirror world?
[5910.70s -> 5912.46s]  Yeah, that is strange.
[5913.02s -> 5915.00s]  That's something to do with how the game is being rendered.
[5915.00s -> 5915.96s]  I don't know why it's doing that.
[5922.50s -> 5922.90s]  Let's go.
[5928.39s -> 5930.47s]  Drive to the Springfield Town Hall.
[5933.77s -> 5935.21s]  You got it, Bart.
[5938.22s -> 5939.03s]  Wait.
[5939.03s -> 5939.75s]  Not yet.
[5939.75s -> 5940.15s]  What's this?
[5940.87s -> 5951.62s]  It's not...
[5951.62s -> 5952.74s]  That's a reference that I don't get.
[5953.38s -> 5957.29s]  It's a reference.
[5960.54s -> 5961.58s]  That was anti-climactic.
[5961.58s -> 5962.46s]  I should have drove through that.
[5963.26s -> 5966.26s]  Oh, my god.
[5967.46s -> 5968.50s]  A fucking timer up there.
[5970.90s -> 5972.10s]  No problemo.
[5972.10s -> 5974.57s]  Oh, damn it.
[5979.94s -> 5980.66s]  Not a joke.
[5980.66s -> 5981.30s]  No, I...
[5981.30s -> 5982.02s]  No, it wasn't.
[5982.02s -> 5984.02s]  I wasn't even paying any attention to it.
[5988.82s -> 5989.62s]  I just...
[5989.62s -> 5994.26s]  For some reason, just my brain turned off the fact that the top corner of the screen was a timer.
[5994.26s -> 5995.94s]  And that every single mission is timing.
[6007.94s -> 6008.90s]  The whole thing again.
[6008.90s -> 6009.46s]  God damn it.
[6018.20s -> 6019.08s]  Boomer memory.
[6020.84s -> 6021.32s]  No.
[6021.32s -> 6021.80s]  No.
[6021.80s -> 6022.04s]  No.
[6022.68s -> 6023.88s]  Wait, Moses is right next to it.
[6039.64s -> 6040.36s]  Fireworks.
[6040.36s -> 6040.60s]  Yeah.
[6041.40s -> 6045.19s]  Talk to him.
[6046.92s -> 6047.64s]  Sorry, Bart.
[6053.37s -> 6054.25s]  All right.
[6054.25s -> 6054.97s]  I think my...
[6054.97s -> 6055.61s]  You know what it was?
[6055.61s -> 6057.29s]  It was the fact that the timer's not there now.
[6058.89s -> 6060.09s]  Timer's not there.
[6060.09s -> 6061.05s]  You know what I mean?
[6061.05s -> 6062.49s]  Timer is not here.
[6062.49s -> 6063.61s]  I didn't pay attention.
[6063.61s -> 6064.41s]  And now it is.
[6065.29s -> 6066.25s]  So that's why.
[6070.12s -> 6075.37s]  And I wanted to look at the city.
[6076.01s -> 6091.66s]  All right.
[6091.66s -> 6093.78s]  Got it.
[6093.78s -> 6094.58s]  No timer, right?
[6094.58s -> 6095.06s]  I can do this?
[6095.86s -> 6107.61s]  Here are your fireworks.
[6113.61s -> 6121.96s]  He's still going.
[6122.84s -> 6128.50s]  Still timed.
[6128.50s -> 6129.22s]  Don't make...
[6129.22s -> 6130.10s]  Don't let me forget that.
[6141.78s -> 6146.94s]  Because I will get out of this car and just start pressing buttons on stuff.
[6147.82s -> 6149.56s]  Don't explode.
[6149.56s -> 6151.00s]  I don't want to do this whole fucking thing again.
[6173.10s -> 6174.14s]  That's terrifying.
[6174.14s -> 6175.34s]  That's a terrifying Ralph.
[6175.34s -> 6177.10s]  All right.
[6177.10s -> 6177.74s]  Hold on a minute.
[6178.46s -> 6179.61s]  I need a new car.
[6181.61s -> 6182.17s]  Oh, fuck.
[6182.17s -> 6182.97s]  This is going to explode.
[6182.97s -> 6184.41s]  My car's going to explode.
[6184.41s -> 6186.09s]  Can I steal a car as Bart?
[6192.38s -> 6202.49s]  Am I going to...
[6202.49s -> 6203.61s]  I don't understand what the bar is for.
[6204.41s -> 6211.18s]  This is saying don't go this way.
[6211.18s -> 6211.98s]  Is this the end of the game?
[6213.10s -> 6214.14s]  No, it's not an invisible wall.
[6214.14s -> 6214.30s]  Okay.
[6215.10s -> 6217.11s]  I was just making sure that was an invisible wall.
[6217.91s -> 6231.05s]  Drive to the go-goplex.
[6239.10s -> 6240.54s]  Incoming great song.
[6241.34s -> 6250.73s]  Can I just plow through this?
[6251.45s -> 6255.18s]  No, I have to go all the way around.
[6257.18s -> 6257.50s]  Wait.
[6257.50s -> 6257.90s]  Where's it...
[6261.90s -> 6263.74s]  That guy is driving in the wrong place.
[6264.46s -> 6287.40s]  Too many detours.
[6290.44s -> 6291.88s]  Is the passenger still in the taxi?
[6291.88s -> 6293.64s]  Yeah, that's the one driving the taxi.
[6293.64s -> 6294.76s]  That's how they can get away with this.
[6295.64s -> 6301.05s]  All right.
[6301.05s -> 6302.09s]  Comic book guy, what do you got?
[6304.54s -> 6304.86s]  I think...
[6305.98s -> 6306.46s]  Ready?
[6306.46s -> 6306.86s]  Here it comes.
[6318.30s -> 6329.67s]  Race to the nerd.
[6329.67s -> 6332.07s]  Race the nerd to the Java server.
[6332.07s -> 6333.27s]  You got it.
[6333.27s -> 6340.41s]  Don't forget to ride.
[6340.41s -> 6340.81s]  How do I...
[6340.81s -> 6343.45s]  How am I racing the nerd when I'm in the nerd's car?
[6350.42s -> 6351.22s]  The other nerd.
[6351.78s -> 6359.37s]  There's two nerds.
[6359.37s -> 6360.89s]  Well, this nerd's car sucks.
[6370.02s -> 6371.06s]  Glancing blow.
[6372.82s -> 6374.82s]  I spilled my squishy.
[6374.82s -> 6376.90s]  We don't have deflector shields, you know.
[6378.42s -> 6382.65s]  Bart Simpson at your service.
[6384.68s -> 6385.40s]  Warp speed.
[6389.30s -> 6390.34s]  Oh, bullpup.
[6390.34s -> 6391.62s]  Aww, loser.
[6393.26s -> 6395.88s]  All right, let's power through it.
[6396.60s -> 6400.06s]  You can drive through trees.
[6400.06s -> 6400.54s]  This is not...
[6400.54s -> 6403.74s]  Man, this sucks.
[6403.74s -> 6405.10s]  Unbelievable.
[6405.10s -> 6420.46s]  Well, that just got a little more rare.
[6421.34s -> 6423.59s]  That was totally...
[6423.59s -> 6424.07s]  Engage.
[6424.63s -> 6425.83s]  I think you could have avoided...
[6427.05s -> 6428.17s]  I just...
[6428.17s -> 6430.01s]  What was I supposed to do after that?
[6430.01s -> 6431.29s]  Total failure at the beginning.
[6431.93s -> 6446.65s]  Right, now I'm losing.
[6448.55s -> 6450.23s]  That lady got fucking destroyed.
[6451.35s -> 6456.49s]  We don't have deflector shields, you know.
[6461.66s -> 6462.78s]  What the fuck was that?
[6463.50s -> 6469.91s]  I blame no one.
[6469.91s -> 6471.03s]  Whoa, wicked.
[6474.22s -> 6475.02s]  I'm happy to report...
[6475.02s -> 6475.66s]  Lucky break.
[6475.66s -> 6478.46s]  ...that your quest for Bone Storm 2 is quite futile.
[6478.46s -> 6481.10s]  Professor Frank posted a message on my news group,
[6481.10s -> 6484.70s]  alt.furyanimals.fanfiction.net,
[6484.70s -> 6487.42s]  that he has bought up all the remaining video games.
[6489.18s -> 6491.82s]  I'll thank you not to moan in my mid-sized vehicle.
[6493.98s -> 6496.66s]  Furry animals.
[6497.38s -> 6503.90s]  Wait, can I take his car?
[6504.94s -> 6505.50s]  It's gone.
[6505.50s -> 6505.82s]  Okay.
[6509.91s -> 6511.91s]  So there's Family Sedan,
[6512.89s -> 6514.09s]  Fire Truck Limo,
[6515.13s -> 6516.49s]  World War II vehicle,
[6517.77s -> 6518.73s]  Surveillance Van,
[6518.73s -> 6519.77s]  Duff Truck,
[6519.77s -> 6520.73s]  Electorus,
[6523.94s -> 6525.46s]  Speed, Acceleration, Toughness.
[6526.66s -> 6530.44s]  This is the best thing.
[6539.59s -> 6540.23s]  All right, give me that.
[6545.88s -> 6546.38s]  All right.
[6547.32s -> 6548.81s]  Good old Bart.
[6549.37s -> 6551.50s]  Who doesn't like Bart?
[6551.50s -> 6556.58s]  There's a race right here.
[6557.30s -> 6560.28s]  Let's do it.
[6562.42s -> 6562.82s]  I don't...
[6562.82s -> 6563.70s]  You don't like Bart?
[6572.63s -> 6575.43s]  Pass all checkpoints and cross the finish line first.
[6575.43s -> 6576.47s]  Don't destroy your vehicle.
[6577.11s -> 6583.35s]  I mean, that was...
[6583.35s -> 6584.23s]  That was cute.
[6584.23s -> 6584.71s]  That was cute.
[6585.35s -> 6587.72s]  Why is there a taxi?
[6592.63s -> 6593.27s]  Oh, boy.
[6593.99s -> 6596.23s]  I'm sure I'm not driving against...
[6596.23s -> 6598.71s]  and racing against ghosts of my own driving.
[6599.51s -> 6604.86s]  I'm just facing my own ghosts.
[6604.86s -> 6609.19s]  This guy's gonna be hard to pass.
[6611.93s -> 6619.19s]  We're going on the highway?
[6620.66s -> 6621.38s]  Yes, we are.
[6626.36s -> 6627.16s]  Just pass him.
[6627.80s -> 6629.56s]  No, he got to do the cool thing and I didn't.
[6637.91s -> 6639.35s]  Oh, did not expect that.
[6639.35s -> 6639.75s]  It's over.
[6639.75s -> 6640.25s]  I lost.
[6651.02s -> 6652.54s]  I need a better car, probably.
[6652.54s -> 6653.04s]  Yeah.
[6653.66s -> 6655.74s]  Maybe if I can get up there real quick.
[6656.30s -> 6657.93s]  All right, so...
[6657.93s -> 6672.46s]  If you ain't fast, you're last.
[6672.46s -> 6673.26s]  Yeah, that's true.
[6674.14s -> 6678.78s]  Does this count if I don't...
[6678.78s -> 6679.18s]  It does.
[6679.18s -> 6679.74s]  Okay.
[6679.74s -> 6679.90s]  I don't...
[6679.90s -> 6680.38s]  You don't have to...
[6680.38s -> 6681.42s]  I don't have to touch them.
[6681.42s -> 6682.46s]  I don't have to touch those.
[6683.26s -> 6685.18s]  I just have to go...
[6685.18s -> 6685.66s]  Okay.
[6685.66s -> 6686.70s]  That changes everything.
[6688.50s -> 6690.82s]  I thought I actually had to go near that circle.
[6691.54s -> 6699.38s]  No, you ain't gonna fuck that up.
[6704.82s -> 6706.10s]  I'm in front now.
[6706.10s -> 6709.29s]  The car's faster than mine, so I...
[6709.29s -> 6710.49s]  That's not fair.
[6710.49s -> 6710.99s]  Not fair.
[6714.82s -> 6715.86s]  Just like in NASCAR.
[6715.86s -> 6716.74s]  Gonna stay on the inside.
[6727.03s -> 6727.91s]  How dare you?
[6728.47s -> 6731.99s]  How dare you do that to me at the very end?
[6731.99s -> 6732.49s]  Oh.
[6734.68s -> 6736.12s]  Oh, I had it too.
[6736.76s -> 6737.08s]  I just...
[6740.57s -> 6741.69s]  Unbelievable.
[6741.69s -> 6743.13s]  That was so stupid.
[6751.32s -> 6752.28s]  How fucking...
[6752.28s -> 6752.78s]  Come on.
[6755.42s -> 6756.46s]  That was bullshit too.
[6756.46s -> 6757.58s]  It was just a bunch of bullshit.
[6758.14s -> 6761.96s]  All right, I'm all right again.
[6770.12s -> 6770.84s]  Good.
[6770.84s -> 6772.94s]  Just don't let that happen again.
[6773.66s -> 6775.21s]  She's got a fast...
[6775.21s -> 6775.85s]  She...
[6775.85s -> 6776.89s]  She got a faster car than me.
[6776.89s -> 6777.69s]  That's Lisa, right?
[6781.19s -> 6781.91s]  Stay on the inside.
[6783.93s -> 6784.73s]  She's right behind me.
[6784.73s -> 6785.61s]  She's gonna pass me.
[6788.97s -> 6790.33s]  No, she's right here.
[6791.21s -> 6792.57s]  I got a left-hand turn coming up.
[6795.91s -> 6796.47s]  Got it.
[6796.47s -> 6796.97s]  Okay.
[6797.90s -> 6798.40s]  Don't...
[6803.16s -> 6803.96s]  That was so close.
[6811.58s -> 6812.30s]  Give it to me.
[6812.30s -> 6812.94s]  Give me the car.
[6816.90s -> 6817.78s]  I can't take the car.
[6818.42s -> 6819.98s]  This car's so much better.
[6819.98s -> 6821.10s]  Is it Lisa?
[6821.10s -> 6827.38s]  I can't do anything about it.
[6827.38s -> 6827.88s]  Not allowed.
[6828.42s -> 6833.51s]  Who else has that hair?
[6836.41s -> 6837.21s]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[6842.38s -> 6843.26s]  We got a side mission.
[6843.82s -> 6844.38s]  It's Grandpa.
[6845.18s -> 6847.34s]  What do you need?
[6847.98s -> 6851.27s]  I need your car from the war.
[6851.27s -> 6851.83s]  The war?
[6852.47s -> 6852.79s]  What?
[6852.79s -> 6854.31s]  Is the Kaiser at it again?
[6854.31s -> 6855.43s]  I'll teach him.
[6855.43s -> 6858.95s]  He stole my best girl and my best box of saltwater taffy.
[6858.95s -> 6860.95s]  Grandpa, you're not making any sense.
[6860.95s -> 6863.99s]  I'm tired because I let Jasper borrow my blood.
[6863.99s -> 6865.91s]  I didn't think I'd need it.
[6865.91s -> 6866.41s]  No.
[6867.91s -> 6868.87s]  Saltwater taffy?
[6870.55s -> 6872.07s]  I love saltwater taffy.
[6872.07s -> 6873.35s]  Now you got my attention, chat.
[6873.99s -> 6874.47s]  What is it?
[6876.02s -> 6876.66s]  You need something?
[6877.22s -> 6877.70s]  What's going on?
[6885.88s -> 6886.92s]  Boomers like taffy.
[6888.31s -> 6891.43s]  This camera control is in the menu.
[6898.94s -> 6900.14s]  Camera left.
[6900.14s -> 6901.18s]  Oh, hold on a minute.
[6902.22s -> 6903.42s]  Numpad 4.
[6903.42s -> 6904.06s]  Camera left.
[6905.74s -> 6906.38s]  Camera right.
[6908.49s -> 6909.45s]  Camera move in.
[6912.71s -> 6913.67s]  Camera move out.
[6915.16s -> 6915.96s]  Camera zoom.
[6916.92s -> 6921.35s]  Camera look up.
[6925.29s -> 6927.96s]  Well, that's okay.
[6927.96s -> 6928.52s]  Thank God.
[6934.33s -> 6938.86s]  Well, that changes everything.
[6939.58s -> 6941.30s]  How many times have I said that?
[6941.30s -> 6942.42s]  Well, that changes everything.
[6948.07s -> 6948.39s]  Six.
[6957.40s -> 6961.38s]  Come on.
[6962.10s -> 6969.99s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6969.99s -> 6970.31s]  Where is it?
[6970.31s -> 6970.79s]  Where is it?
[6973.64s -> 6973.88s]  What?
[6995.77s -> 7004.55s]  I don't know why I did this.
[7012.25s -> 7014.17s]  I have to keep going into modes over and over again.
[7015.21s -> 7023.34s]  Hello.
[7023.98s -> 7024.54s]  Action button.
[7025.88s -> 7026.52s]  I pressed it.
[7039.69s -> 7041.85s]  I'm interacting with the DD jar.
[7041.85s -> 7042.81s]  Well, what?
[7047.69s -> 7048.09s]  Come on.
[7048.09s -> 7050.65s]  I'm standing right here and it's like press action.
[7051.45s -> 7052.25s]  I'm right here.
[7069.03s -> 7069.59s]  Wait, what?
[7080.39s -> 7083.05s]  I thought he just gave it to me.
[7083.05s -> 7083.45s]  Why does it?
[7096.63s -> 7099.50s]  I fucked that guy up bad.
[7103.54s -> 7104.90s]  Too many cars on the road.
[7119.58s -> 7121.02s]  I'm collecting everybody's blood.
[7121.02s -> 7122.22s]  This is a little weird.
[7123.10s -> 7125.08s]  I got a minute to go back to grandpa.
[7128.01s -> 7128.65s]  Eat ass?
[7152.23s -> 7153.19s]  I'm gonna set the cops on me.
[7153.19s -> 7153.91s]  Don't touch anybody.
[7157.45s -> 7171.59s]  That's Bart's catchphrase.
[7176.54s -> 7177.82s]  No, it's eat my shorts.
[7181.26s -> 7181.90s]  Is that enough?
[7181.90s -> 7183.10s]  I need another car.
[7183.10s -> 7183.74s]  Take it.
[7183.74s -> 7186.14s]  Oh, I'm gonna pour this on my flapjacks.
[7187.66s -> 7190.42s]  So I got a new car.
[7190.42s -> 7192.50s]  You've unlocked grandpa's World War II vehicle.
[7192.50s -> 7193.62s]  Go to a phone to use it.
[7193.62s -> 7193.94s]  Okay.
[7195.06s -> 7201.35s]  This thing's not bad.
[7205.75s -> 7207.83s]  It's not eat my ass.
[7207.83s -> 7208.31s]  Why?
[7208.31s -> 7209.83s]  No, it's eat my shorts.
[7214.14s -> 7216.22s]  There it is.
[7216.94s -> 7218.36s]  Move it, you milkshake!
[7219.40s -> 7221.32s]  This thing is kind of tricky to move around.
[7222.04s -> 7224.39s]  Did I do something wrong?
[7235.05s -> 7246.87s]  Had to get that.
[7247.51s -> 7248.23s]  What is this up here?
[7249.03s -> 7251.64s]  A little place to go.
[7251.64s -> 7253.08s]  Ooh, would you look at this?
[7254.04s -> 7256.30s]  What's that?
[7258.92s -> 7259.24s]  No.
[7260.28s -> 7275.80s]  I'll get it.
[7275.80s -> 7277.08s]  One, two, three, go.
[7277.88s -> 7280.94s]  I can go over there too.
[7280.94s -> 7281.26s]  Oops.
[7283.21s -> 7283.61s]  Hurry!
[7284.73s -> 7290.95s]  Give me the coins.
[7290.95s -> 7291.59s]  All of them.
[7291.59s -> 7292.71s]  Can I reach these without falling?
[7292.71s -> 7293.43s]  Yes, I can.
[7295.54s -> 7296.58s]  What's this one?
[7296.58s -> 7297.70s]  Mr. Honey Bunny.
[7298.34s -> 7303.43s]  I'm gonna go this way too.
[7305.16s -> 7306.84s]  I can platform over this thing.
[7308.92s -> 7312.28s]  Having the camera controls make this a thousand times easier.
[7313.00s -> 7314.73s]  All right, there's a box over there.
[7315.29s -> 7322.63s]  Got the camera.
[7327.24s -> 7330.42s]  Can I get them all?
[7330.42s -> 7330.90s]  I think I can.
[7335.91s -> 7336.55s]  I have to get it.
[7353.18s -> 7354.86s]  The boxes have a lot of coins.
[7354.86s -> 7355.58s]  I gotta get it.
[7356.54s -> 7371.03s]  Stop moving.
[7371.03s -> 7372.95s]  All right, now just get it in the right spot.
[7375.02s -> 7376.46s]  I almost blew the whole thing again.
[7379.54s -> 7381.06s]  That's too many coins to just ignore.
[7386.87s -> 7387.19s]  Sweet.
[7388.47s -> 7389.11s]  Wait.
[7389.11s -> 7389.91s]  No, that's not them.
[7390.55s -> 7391.19s]  Nothing over there?
[7391.91s -> 7392.55s]  Let me just take a look.
[7393.19s -> 7399.66s]  I got, uh, Krusty the Crab.
[7400.54s -> 7401.85s]  I can't make that jump.
[7401.85s -> 7402.65s]  Can I jump over here?
[7403.37s -> 7416.55s]  All right, Grandpa, let's go.
[7417.43s -> 7418.55s]  Take me to my destination.
[7424.55s -> 7425.99s]  This handling is ridiculous.
[7425.99s -> 7426.95s]  Is this car way
[7429.35s -> 7430.07s]  30 pounds?
[7430.95s -> 7432.47s]  Look at this thing.
[7433.27s -> 7435.66s]  All right, this is a gamble.
[7435.66s -> 7436.86s]  I'm now, I got controls.
[7436.86s -> 7438.30s]  I know how to play the game.
[7438.30s -> 7439.74s]  I think it's time to do one of these missions.
[7441.98s -> 7444.78s]  25 cents and then 75 cents.
[7444.78s -> 7446.70s]  Complete an entire lap before the time runs out.
[7446.70s -> 7447.10s]  Let's try it.
[7449.10s -> 7450.54s]  Oh, I just realized I'm using this.
[7451.82s -> 7452.62s]  I see it right there.
[7463.64s -> 7471.06s]  All right, I'll work the pedals and you steer.
[7471.06s -> 7473.22s]  Oh, this is too cool for school.
[7473.22s -> 7474.50s]  Let's make the scene.
[7475.22s -> 7476.10s]  All for March.
[7482.07s -> 7483.59s]  We call sandwiches.
[7483.59s -> 7484.63s]  Glad Freddy.
[7484.63s -> 7486.23s]  There goes 25 cents.
[7487.99s -> 7488.87s]  Get out of my way.
[7488.87s -> 7490.55s]  I thought that was a place to turn in there.
[7491.27s -> 7491.75s]  It's not.
[7492.55s -> 7493.91s]  You go, you can turn the other way.
[7496.26s -> 7498.42s]  What the fuck am I on two wheels for?
[7498.42s -> 7499.30s]  Why did that happen?
[7503.75s -> 7512.34s]  What?
[7512.34s -> 7514.58s]  Wait, I'm getting, hold on a second here.
[7514.58s -> 7516.10s]  I'm getting more time.
[7516.90s -> 7519.29s]  I think I'll still do this.
[7525.88s -> 7526.52s]  No, I'm not.
[7526.52s -> 7527.40s]  That was a lie.
[7528.36s -> 7533.80s]  This is, I have to do the whole thing and yeah, full lap in two tenths.
[7537.53s -> 7538.81s]  I don't know why I'm doing this anymore.
[7539.45s -> 7544.50s]  I should just delete and go do the mission.
[7558.87s -> 7560.47s]  I just gave that guy 25 dollars.
[7561.43s -> 7575.61s]  Downtown to the stadium.
[7576.49s -> 7577.46s]  I want to go this way.
[7582.68s -> 7589.37s]  Nice.
[7599.61s -> 7600.17s]  That was cool.
[7606.60s -> 7608.20s]  Talk to professor Frank.
[7609.00s -> 7612.81s]  I will do that in a second after I break the vending machines.
[7612.81s -> 7616.18s]  No, wait, I want to get on the phone here.
[7616.18s -> 7620.55s]  I got a pregnancy test.
[7627.67s -> 7628.47s]  I want to get up there.
[7631.14s -> 7636.46s]  No, the cards or coins or anything.
[7637.62s -> 7643.54s]  Nope, not yet.
[7654.02s -> 7654.74s]  ADD.
[7654.74s -> 7655.78s]  Well, I got to get these coins.
[7658.26s -> 7659.14s]  That one's gone forever.
[7659.14s -> 7659.46s]  Oh well.
[7669.14s -> 7669.46s]  Again.
[7684.01s -> 7685.21s]  Video games, video games.
[7694.18s -> 7698.66s]  Go to Herman's Military Antiques to find a World War II radio for Professor Frank.
[7714.09s -> 7715.34s]  Okay.
[7719.06s -> 7725.22s]  So I need to tail this to the military place.
[7726.10s -> 7727.26s]  Press select.
[7730.33s -> 7731.45s]  I can't press select.
[7732.41s -> 7741.26s]  Fill bar.
[7741.26s -> 7746.89s]  All right, I'll fill the bar and then you'll see what happens.
[7749.16s -> 7750.76s]  I can't believe we lost, Bart!
[7766.87s -> 7768.07s]  Where is this guy going?
[7769.11s -> 7770.31s]  What the fuck is going on?
[7782.73s -> 7784.41s]  You have to follow it, not tail it.
[7784.41s -> 7786.01s]  If it slows down, you slow down.
[7787.21s -> 7788.65s]  And then they said, idiot.
[7791.06s -> 7791.38s]  Okay.
[7792.34s -> 7795.35s]  All right.
[7796.07s -> 7800.50s]  Is that really that big of a deal?
[7801.93s -> 7802.41s]  Apparently.
[7819.77s -> 7822.23s]  I'm gonna find a thief.
[7823.75s -> 7825.43s]  Everyone's telling me to press select.
[7825.51s -> 7827.59s]  But I don't have, I can't press select on the controller.
[7827.59s -> 7828.23s]  It doesn't do anything.
[7830.34s -> 7834.26s]  So, like, there is no select.
[7834.82s -> 7835.70s]  What is it on the keyboard?
[7836.50s -> 7837.14s]  Like escape?
[7840.41s -> 7841.93s]  Because that's, I can't.
[7849.16s -> 7849.96s]  The select button.
[7849.96s -> 7851.24s]  It doesn't do anything.
[7851.24s -> 7852.28s]  Start doesn't do anything either.
[7856.39s -> 7857.67s]  Press the select key.
[7860.26s -> 7862.26s]  All right, can I, I'm just gonna play the damn game.
[7863.22s -> 7873.94s]  Press the N-E key.
[7873.94s -> 7874.74s]  I know that reference.
[7874.74s -> 7875.62s]  That's Homer Simpson.
[7890.34s -> 7892.18s]  I need that radio you borrowed.
[7892.18s -> 7893.78s]  No way, little dude.
[7893.78s -> 7897.62s]  This radio is going to help me score Bo Q Day chicks.
[7898.58s -> 7903.06s]  Uh, last time I checked, chicks like fast cars, not vintage electronics.
[7903.06s -> 7904.98s]  Why don't we race for the radio?
[7904.98s -> 7907.78s]  Oh, I totally agree to your proposal.
[7910.97s -> 7911.69s]  All right, Snake.
[7913.46s -> 7914.02s]  You and me.
[7914.82s -> 7925.70s]  All right, there's other cars on the road.
[7925.70s -> 7926.42s]  I don't want to fuck this up.
[7930.58s -> 7932.10s]  Why is everything solved in races?
[7932.82s -> 7933.78s]  That's a great question.
[7934.42s -> 7939.72s]  Can't they just do like once, twice, three, shoot?
[7940.36s -> 7943.72s]  Do we have to put everybody in danger?
[7944.52s -> 7948.25s]  I wasn't first.
[7948.25s -> 7948.89s]  I'll get it.
[7948.89s -> 7949.29s]  Hold on.
[7949.29s -> 7949.69s]  I'll get it.
[7950.25s -> 7951.56s]  I'll cut them off up here.
[7957.38s -> 7959.70s]  Extreme to the max.
[7959.70s -> 7960.66s]  You cheated.
[7960.66s -> 7962.74s]  How is it even possible that you're still ahead of me?
[7962.74s -> 7964.10s]  Don't forget the ride.
[7964.10s -> 7965.54s]  I don't even, how is this possible?
[7966.42s -> 7967.86s]  I, I'll accept it.
[7967.86s -> 7969.78s]  Apparently I'm going to accept this.
[7969.78s -> 7975.27s]  Oh, now come on.
[7975.27s -> 7976.39s]  I can't believe I just won.
[7976.39s -> 7977.19s]  That's unbelievable.
[7980.01s -> 7981.69s]  There's no way that that just happened.
[7982.49s -> 7983.13s]  I won though.
[7984.74s -> 7990.20s]  He's a god gamer.
[8004.42s -> 8005.62s]  All right, peel it out, grandpa.
[8005.62s -> 8006.42s]  Let's go.
[8006.42s -> 8010.82s]  We had to say dickity because the Kaiser has stolen our word 20.
[8010.82s -> 8011.78s]  What a big idea.
[8011.78s -> 8012.74s]  Jerma, press select.
[8012.74s -> 8013.46s]  Jerma, press select.
[8013.46s -> 8014.18s]  Jerma, press select.
[8014.18s -> 8014.98s]  Jerma, press select.
[8022.86s -> 8024.22s]  Uh, I already did that one.
[8024.86s -> 8026.94s]  My dad will pay for all the damages.
[8027.50s -> 8028.70s]  How about them apples?
[8029.58s -> 8033.91s]  What did I do something wrong?
[8033.91s -> 8034.87s]  What's this?
[8034.87s -> 8036.15s]  Hold on, is it catapult here?
[8038.22s -> 8038.94s]  Wait a minute.
[8038.94s -> 8040.46s]  I need to examine a catapult.
[8043.56s -> 8044.12s]  Really?
[8044.12s -> 8044.60s]  Who can I?
[8047.61s -> 8049.21s]  Was there an animal in there?
[8049.21s -> 8054.42s]  There was.
[8054.42s -> 8055.22s]  Why am I launching?
[8056.10s -> 8057.24s]  Why am I doing this?
[8057.96s -> 8058.98s]  That's not right.
[8059.62s -> 8070.30s]  We got a race.
[8073.67s -> 8074.63s]  A catapult.
[8075.19s -> 8076.54s]  Trebuchet.
[8078.30s -> 8081.50s]  Nelson, why are you hanging around here?
[8081.50s -> 8083.26s]  Stupid community service.
[8083.26s -> 8085.42s]  I dip Martin in the sauce like Quickie Mart.
[8085.42s -> 8089.42s]  Anyway, get your license and you get some stupid prize from those jerks.
[8090.46s -> 8093.80s]  Complete all laps and finish the race in first place.
[8093.80s -> 8095.40s]  Don't destroy your vehicle.
[8095.40s -> 8095.90s]  Three.
[8099.00s -> 8102.10s]  Press select to win race.
[8102.10s -> 8103.78s]  Eat my dust, dust eaters.
[8104.58s -> 8106.34s]  I'm not going to do that.
[8109.21s -> 8111.05s]  Oh, there goes more memories.
[8111.05s -> 8112.17s]  All right.
[8112.17s -> 8113.05s]  All right.
[8113.05s -> 8113.53s]  That guy.
[8113.53s -> 8114.81s]  I should enjoy this so much.
[8114.81s -> 8115.53s]  This is what they do.
[8115.53s -> 8120.17s]  Every mission so far for the race missions have been we're going to put two dickheads
[8120.17s -> 8124.25s]  on the road and then the guy in first place is the one you're actually racing against.
[8124.25s -> 8127.61s]  The other two people are just obstacles in your way.
[8129.13s -> 8132.50s]  Because now I'm so look at I'm so far behind.
[8133.30s -> 8141.06s]  How am I going to catch up in time?
[8141.06s -> 8143.14s]  I got to get first immediately.
[8143.78s -> 8149.00s]  Is there a shortcut I can do?
[8149.88s -> 8152.82s]  Stop having a cow.
[8153.46s -> 8154.02s]  I'm sorry.
[8154.02s -> 8154.90s]  I didn't do it.
[8154.90s -> 8155.40s]  Oops.
[8156.66s -> 8157.78s]  I don't think I'm going to do it.
[8158.42s -> 8158.98s]  I'm going to restart.
[8159.86s -> 8160.98s]  Because there's no way.
[8160.98s -> 8162.02s]  I'm not going to catch up with this guy.
[8163.30s -> 8164.92s]  There's no way I'm going to catch up.
[8168.33s -> 8169.29s]  Just go faster.
[8169.93s -> 8171.29s]  I'm holding down right trigger.
[8176.25s -> 8176.97s]  See watch this.
[8178.36s -> 8179.08s]  It's Lisa.
[8179.08s -> 8179.96s]  It's Lisa again.
[8179.96s -> 8181.72s]  Your car is great and you're a great driver.
[8182.52s -> 8188.47s]  All right.
[8188.47s -> 8189.27s]  I made it through the.
[8189.27s -> 8189.75s]  No I didn't.
[8189.75s -> 8190.31s]  This is still here.
[8214.18s -> 8214.58s]  All right.
[8215.06s -> 8218.89s]  Yeah I told you why I ought to.
[8218.89s -> 8219.69s]  What's my name?
[8221.29s -> 8221.61s]  All right.
[8221.61s -> 8222.65s]  I'm not in a bad position.
[8222.65s -> 8224.97s]  Just going to keep it up.
[8229.85s -> 8230.33s]  All right.
[8230.33s -> 8231.37s]  Get in there.
[8231.37s -> 8231.93s]  Get in there.
[8237.48s -> 8237.80s]  Good.
[8239.70s -> 8240.90s]  She lost it there for a second.
[8243.80s -> 8244.44s]  Having trouble.
[8245.16s -> 8247.88s]  Stay on the inside.
[8256.31s -> 8257.37s]  Running to you.
[8259.82s -> 8261.26s]  That's exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
[8262.86s -> 8263.74s]  What did he just say?
[8264.70s -> 8265.18s]  What?
[8265.18s -> 8265.98s]  Hold on.
[8265.98s -> 8266.22s]  What?
[8275.43s -> 8275.99s]  All right.
[8275.99s -> 8276.71s]  Good.
[8276.71s -> 8278.55s]  Every time I end up bumping into you here.
[8282.38s -> 8282.86s]  Come on.
[8284.74s -> 8285.22s]  Come on.
[8286.18s -> 8286.58s]  Come on.
[8286.58s -> 8287.14s]  This is the end.
[8287.14s -> 8287.46s]  Right here.
[8287.46s -> 8287.78s]  Throw that.
[8305.19s -> 8308.07s]  I got to do the last one and get the car for this stage.
[8308.07s -> 8308.39s]  Right.
[8309.19s -> 8314.49s]  I'm not going to lie.
[8314.49s -> 8320.17s]  I was just pressing up on the d-pad to call the horse.
[8330.09s -> 8330.81s]  Look at me.
[8330.81s -> 8332.41s]  I'm free as a bird.
[8332.41s -> 8332.65s]  All right.
[8332.65s -> 8333.53s]  Look at the last race.
[8338.90s -> 8340.58s]  Where is the final race?
[8346.07s -> 8349.96s]  I don't know.
[8349.96s -> 8350.44s]  Wow.
[8350.44s -> 8351.40s]  That was interesting.
[8352.12s -> 8354.30s]  And go through here.
[8361.35s -> 8363.19s]  Oh, I spilled my sea bag.
[8369.59s -> 8370.95s]  Press select for the map.
[8374.78s -> 8375.98s]  There is no map.
[8384.06s -> 8384.70s]  Yes, there is.
[8385.26s -> 8388.78s]  I just pressed M.
[8391.06s -> 8392.34s]  Select to use boost.
[8399.96s -> 8401.00s]  Oh, how do I get that?
[8407.66s -> 8412.06s]  Get out of here, B.
[8412.94s -> 8413.54s]  All right.
[8413.54s -> 8414.66s]  If I climb up there, I should get it.
[8415.46s -> 8417.21s]  Right here.
[8417.21s -> 8426.47s]  Wait.
[8426.47s -> 8429.03s]  Kind of hard to see.
[8430.15s -> 8430.55s]  Damn.
[8430.55s -> 8431.51s]  That's tricky.
[8432.31s -> 8442.68s]  Camera doesn't want to stay in the right place.
[8454.18s -> 8455.46s]  Big butt skinner.
[8457.46s -> 8467.56s]  For the crusty burger.
[8468.28s -> 8469.91s]  Speaking of burgers.
[8470.55s -> 8471.67s]  I could go for a burger.
[8474.07s -> 8474.71s]  A huge one.
[8474.71s -> 8475.83s]  Nice one.
[8475.83s -> 8476.71s]  A double at least.
[8477.99s -> 8479.11s]  I would take a triple.
[8479.11s -> 8481.74s]  Out of my way, man.
[8481.74s -> 8483.10s]  No, that's too much.
[8483.10s -> 8485.98s]  I'm going to sneeze now.
[8485.98s -> 8486.70s]  Can I mute and type?
[8488.26s -> 8490.02s]  Hey, slower traffic to the right, please.
[8490.02s -> 8490.42s]  Did I get it?
[8490.42s -> 8491.06s]  I think I got it.
[8493.10s -> 8494.14s]  Easy peasy.
[8495.02s -> 8502.02s]  Hey there, Mr. Slackjaw Yokel.
[8502.02s -> 8503.06s]  That be I.
[8503.06s -> 8504.82s]  Can I borrow your satellite dish?
[8504.82s -> 8505.54s]  Sure.
[8505.54s -> 8509.62s]  If you help me scoop up my flat meat, sophisticated city youngster.
[8510.42s -> 8511.22s]  Best burger place?
[8512.90s -> 8514.02s]  I'm a big fan of Shake Shack.
[8519.16s -> 8520.60s]  No problemo.
[8520.60s -> 8529.48s]  I'm going to get all these.
[8534.39s -> 8535.27s]  Five Guys is good.
[8536.39s -> 8536.79s]  Shake Shack.
[8536.79s -> 8538.87s]  But I would put Shake Shack above Five Guys.
[8540.31s -> 8547.38s]  We're talking like counter-serve burgers and yeah.
[8547.38s -> 8548.50s]  Shake Shack, yes.
[8558.42s -> 8561.06s]  Can you please not be directly in the path that I need?
[8561.06s -> 8562.58s]  And the train's coming.
[8572.70s -> 8575.50s]  Best restaurant burger actually sitting down at a restaurant.
[8579.69s -> 8581.37s]  I had the best burger I've ever had in my life.
[8583.19s -> 8587.51s]  And it's down on the strip.
[8588.47s -> 8591.69s]  Oh fuck, I have to deliver this now.
[8597.13s -> 8599.85s]  The Hash House has the best burger I've ever had in my whole life.
[8600.89s -> 8601.93s]  From a sit-down restaurant.
[8601.93s -> 8603.85s]  It was absolutely fucking unbelievable.
[8604.65s -> 8618.55s]  Am I going to make this?
[8619.43s -> 8622.12s]  Am I not paying attention?
[8623.37s -> 8624.09s]  Did I fuck something?
[8624.09s -> 8624.49s]  No, I'm not.
[8624.49s -> 8626.82s]  I'm fine.
[8626.82s -> 8627.62s]  If I had In-N-Out.
[8627.62s -> 8628.82s]  Yeah, I'm not a fan of In-N-Out.
[8630.34s -> 8631.30s]  I don't really know.
[8631.30s -> 8632.74s]  I'm not like a big fan of In-N-Out.
[8632.74s -> 8635.70s]  I think it's just kind of like a Wendy's cheeseburger that's
[8635.70s -> 8636.02s]  cheap.
[8637.77s -> 8638.41s]  Sorry, guys.
[8645.56s -> 8646.12s]  What?
[8646.12s -> 8646.84s]  Get away from...
[8650.31s -> 8651.43s]  I don't hate In-N-Out.
[8651.43s -> 8652.07s]  I think it's good.
[8652.79s -> 8657.35s]  But I think it's like a step up from a place like Wendy's, I think.
[8657.35s -> 8660.31s]  The best thing about In-N-Out is In-N-Out is really fast and it's really cheap.
[8660.71s -> 8664.79s]  I wish I had some really big tires like I saw on the TV once.
[8666.79s -> 8667.83s]  Am I going to lose right now?
[8667.83s -> 8668.87s]  This is too cool for school.
[8669.67s -> 8674.76s]  That's the bomb.
[8674.76s -> 8675.40s]  But I don't know.
[8676.60s -> 8679.24s]  Me and Star went to In-N-Out and people were like,
[8679.24s -> 8680.52s]  go to In-N-Out, go to In-N-Out, go to In-N-Out.
[8680.52s -> 8681.64s]  We went to In-N-Out and it was...
[8683.53s -> 8684.65s]  Both of us said the same thing.
[8684.65s -> 8686.41s]  We were like, oh, that was all right, I guess.
[8687.21s -> 8700.14s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[8700.14s -> 8702.06s]  There's nothing wrong with In-N-Out.
[8702.06s -> 8704.54s]  Rusty burgers are made of roadkill?
[8704.54s -> 8704.94s]  It's just...
[8704.94s -> 8707.10s]  That explains the tire tracks.
[8707.10s -> 8711.50s]  I don't think it's at this extreme God-like level that some people say it is.
[8711.50s -> 8717.70s]  Thanks in Red Hill, Billy.
[8717.70s -> 8718.58s]  Torrent nothing.
[8719.38s -> 8721.90s]  Stop it, stop it.
[8724.14s -> 8724.64s]  Got it.
[8733.45s -> 8734.81s]  But I think that that's the problem, though,
[8734.81s -> 8737.37s]  because it's just like a good hamburger.
[8739.86s -> 8747.46s]  People lift it up to be this thing that you have to eat and God will come down
[8747.46s -> 8749.22s]  and grace you when you put it in your mouth.
[8751.18s -> 8754.94s]  Once you take a bite of an In-N-Out burger, God appears and says,
[8754.94s -> 8755.74s]  don't you like that?
[8755.74s -> 8756.62s]  I made it for you.
[8773.93s -> 8775.37s]  My compliments to the chef.
[8785.59s -> 8786.39s]  Do the last race.
[8787.27s -> 8788.07s]  Is this the last mission?
[8788.95s -> 8792.06s]  Maybe I'll just cancel the thing.
[8793.53s -> 8794.81s]  Well, I guess I'm not even doing it, so...
[8800.01s -> 8801.85s]  All right, where is the last race?
[8801.85s -> 8802.89s]  We got one here.
[8802.89s -> 8803.77s]  Where did that one?
[8804.73s -> 8814.46s]  Not yet.
[8814.46s -> 8822.15s]  Somebody just said In-N-Out is a slightly better McDonald's.
[8823.75s -> 8827.51s]  I don't know if I would go that far to say that.
[8827.51s -> 8838.86s]  Where did that one?
[8838.86s -> 8839.74s]  Where's the last one?
[8839.74s -> 8850.34s]  Well, there's the two there.
[8850.34s -> 8851.22s]  They're right next to each other.
[8852.10s -> 8859.69s]  Anybody know where it is?
[8860.33s -> 8863.14s]  I have no fucking idea.
[8867.26s -> 8867.90s]  Why is everybody...
[8867.90s -> 8868.38s]  Hold on, wait.
[8868.38s -> 8869.34s]  Why is everybody adding...
[8872.49s -> 8873.21s]  What are you doing?
[8880.44s -> 8881.88s]  What are you doing?
[8881.88s -> 8883.08s]  No, stop this.
[8883.88s -> 8885.16s]  Stop this nonsense.
[8888.63s -> 8889.19s]  What is this?
[8892.58s -> 8894.02s]  Sorry, I just saw them and I...
[8898.94s -> 8904.73s]  You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now.
[8905.37s -> 8910.58s]  Did I break the phone?
[8910.58s -> 8911.62s]  Get out of the taxi.
[8912.42s -> 8917.00s]  I can still use it.
[8917.00s -> 8918.20s]  All right, I want the family car.
[8931.72s -> 8932.92s]  All right, all right, all right.
[8932.92s -> 8936.92s]  Am I gonna have to like put it into fucking slow down mode?
[8941.14s -> 8943.14s]  Last race is next to Sneed.
[8943.14s -> 8944.02s]  Where is that though?
[8944.98s -> 8946.98s]  I haven't seen this television show in my life.
[8946.98s -> 8947.54s]  Over this way?
[8948.50s -> 8953.90s]  All right, am I going the right way?
[8954.70s -> 8956.46s]  If I go through the Buzz Cola sign.
[8963.02s -> 8964.70s]  Did I just say something I shouldn't have said?
[8965.50s -> 8970.49s]  It's near the fire truck ramp.
[8970.49s -> 8971.45s]  That's kind of far away.
[8984.52s -> 8985.96s]  Did I actually just say something?
[8986.92s -> 9002.50s]  All right, here's Moe's head down here.
[9005.78s -> 9008.38s]  This is the factory.
[9012.71s -> 9014.47s]  I really don't know where the hell I'm even going.
[9022.41s -> 9023.61s]  Guys, just be honest with me.
[9023.61s -> 9025.69s]  Am I even going remotely in the right direction?
[9033.14s -> 9033.38s]  No.
[9035.64s -> 9036.52s]  I passed it?
[9037.08s -> 9037.80s]  No, I didn't.
[9043.13s -> 9043.93s]  The mini map.
[9044.49s -> 9046.17s]  But there's nothing on the mini map.
[9046.17s -> 9047.05s]  There's just that flip.
[9047.85s -> 9054.57s]  I'm looking for the race.
[9055.29s -> 9056.01s]  Downtown.
[9056.81s -> 9060.30s]  Sneed is not downtown.
[9061.02s -> 9066.79s]  Just go in any direction long enough and you're gonna find it.
[9067.51s -> 9084.44s]  What the fuck?
[9085.42s -> 9086.38s]  All right, you know what?
[9093.83s -> 9094.39s]  I found it!
[9113.30s -> 9113.70s]  Let's go.
[9114.50s -> 9115.78s]  I'm fucking pumped now, man.
[9116.74s -> 9117.94s]  I'm so amped up for this.
[9132.06s -> 9132.78s]  This is weird.
[9133.42s -> 9137.54s]  Did I do something wrong?
[9142.20s -> 9144.71s]  I don't...
[9144.71s -> 9145.27s]  This is weird.
[9152.95s -> 9156.54s]  Am I going the right way?
[9156.54s -> 9157.42s]  Do I have to actually...
[9157.42s -> 9158.46s]  I'm so confused.
[9159.34s -> 9167.40s]  One more lap?
[9177.78s -> 9178.98s]  What the hell is going on?
[9182.47s -> 9185.99s]  Somebody said go through the roundabout and I don't know why I even looked at the chat.
[9185.99s -> 9187.19s]  Go through the roundabout.
[9187.19s -> 9188.15s]  What am I doing?
[9189.46s -> 9190.02s]  You can't.
[9190.02s -> 9191.62s]  You have to go around the whole thing.
[9194.01s -> 9194.97s]  Go through the roundabout.
[9194.97s -> 9195.77s]  There's a roundabout.
[9195.77s -> 9196.49s]  What are you doing?
[9196.49s -> 9198.49s]  And I'm like, aye, aye, yeah.
[9199.61s -> 9200.11s]  Yeah.
[9209.74s -> 9210.78s]  He's very smart.
[9222.90s -> 9225.10s]  This time I'm not gonna look at chat.
[9225.10s -> 9226.70s]  I'm just gonna do it.
[9226.70s -> 9227.74s]  I'm so fucking mad.
[9228.30s -> 9229.58s]  I'm so fucking mad.
[9237.03s -> 9237.91s]  It totally took like...
[9238.71s -> 9239.75s]  Well, how long did it take?
[9239.75s -> 9240.63s]  Was it about two hours?
[9240.63s -> 9241.75s]  No, it's been a while.
[9241.75s -> 9243.11s]  I haven't had like a meltdown yet.
[9243.98s -> 9245.58s]  No, there aren't gonna be a meltdown tonight.
[9245.58s -> 9250.30s]  This is Simpsons Bart Simpson drives around and throws stuff and runs away.
[9250.30s -> 9251.58s]  I'm not gonna get angry at it.
[9253.18s -> 9254.06s]  Why would that happen?
[9254.78s -> 9261.34s]  I just saved two or three full seconds.
[9268.41s -> 9269.37s]  You already are.
[9269.37s -> 9270.09s]  I am not.
[9270.09s -> 9271.21s]  You would know if I was.
[9273.19s -> 9275.21s]  I would have made like a weird sound effect.
[9275.21s -> 9275.77s]  You know what I mean?
[9290.04s -> 9290.92s]  Do it.
[9290.92s -> 9291.72s]  It's right here.
[9297.48s -> 9301.56s]  Next time you stay at our place, you can have the steamed vegetable of your choice.
[9304.30s -> 9306.78s]  Photophone booth to get Moe's Sedan.
[9307.66s -> 9314.70s]  Let's check it out.
[9322.01s -> 9322.97s]  Moe's Sedan.
[9323.69s -> 9327.08s]  It's not bad.
[9327.08s -> 9334.87s]  This is one, one and a half, two and a half, four.
[9334.87s -> 9336.87s]  One, one and a half, two and a half, four.
[9336.87s -> 9338.79s]  One, one and a half, two and a half, four.
[9338.79s -> 9341.35s]  Two, one and a half, two and a half, three and a half.
[9341.35s -> 9341.85s]  That's better.
[9344.95s -> 9351.94s]  It's not actually...
[9351.94s -> 9353.14s]  It's not Moe driving the car.
[9353.14s -> 9353.70s]  This is just...
[9353.70s -> 9355.46s]  This is actually a child driving this car.
[9356.50s -> 9358.04s]  I mean, I gotta go over that.
[9358.76s -> 9359.88s]  How could I not do that?
[9364.44s -> 9365.24s]  Not enough speed.
[9365.24s -> 9365.56s]  Come on.
[9365.56s -> 9366.20s]  What are you trying?
[9366.20s -> 9368.20s]  There are over 5,000 people here.
[9368.20s -> 9370.60s]  You're gonna just drive over that slowly?
[9371.64s -> 9372.12s]  Kidding me?
[9385.42s -> 9386.22s]  Come on, screamer.
[9386.22s -> 9387.18s]  You gotta impress us.
[9397.05s -> 9398.09s]  All right, Professor Frink.
[9398.09s -> 9398.81s]  I got your stuff.
[9401.62s -> 9402.10s]  There you go.
[9416.42s -> 9419.14s]  Everybody...
[9421.94s -> 9423.06s]  Look it over in the chat.
[9423.06s -> 9424.58s]  It's just so many emotions.
[9425.38s -> 9428.26s]  I don't even know which one to interact with.
[9429.06s -> 9434.68s]  There's so much going on over here.
[9435.32s -> 9444.30s]  All right, talk to Dr. Nick.
[9446.95s -> 9452.63s]  Hello.
[9464.71s -> 9466.87s]  I have tortured them horribly, silly.
[9466.87s -> 9469.67s]  There's no way I'll be able to fit all those monkeys in my car.
[9469.67s -> 9471.99s]  I better get a big truck or something.
[9471.99s -> 9473.03s]  No, I ain't playing...
[9473.03s -> 9474.95s]  I'm not playing a fucking OST.
[9476.31s -> 9478.63s]  I'm not playing an OST right now.
[9480.06s -> 9481.26s]  That's not gonna happen.
[9481.82s -> 9482.06s]  No.
[9483.38s -> 9486.76s]  You'll need the plow truck.
[9486.76s -> 9490.12s]  Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot for 200 coins.
[9492.60s -> 9493.48s]  Don't I already own it?
[9494.12s -> 9503.16s]  I already own it.
[9515.67s -> 9516.79s]  There was a T-pose there.
[9516.79s -> 9517.91s]  I can't wait to see it in chat.
[9518.55s -> 9519.75s]  I need your truck, Homer.
[9519.75s -> 9520.95s]  Why should I give you that?
[9520.95s -> 9521.83s]  Because I love you.
[9523.51s -> 9524.47s]  Pay up, sucker.
[9524.47s -> 9526.47s]  You're charging your own son?
[9526.47s -> 9527.59s]  Yeah, I guess I am.
[9528.47s -> 9529.67s]  Now we're in emote only.
[9534.34s -> 9535.86s]  Emote only.
[9535.86s -> 9537.78s]  Oh, the fucking title sucks.
[9538.74s -> 9541.22s]  This title sucks such ass.
[9541.22s -> 9541.78s]  I forgot.
[9541.78s -> 9542.18s]  I was gonna...
[9542.18s -> 9542.98s]  That's a placeholder.
[9545.24s -> 9546.54s]  You've got it.
[9546.54s -> 9547.66s]  I just looked over and saw it.
[9547.66s -> 9547.98s]  Oh, well.
[9555.30s -> 9557.06s]  Find all the monkeys before they escape.
[9559.16s -> 9561.45s]  30 of...
[9561.45s -> 9562.09s]  Oh, god.
[9562.09s -> 9563.80s]  Okay, I gotta go to one corner of the map.
[9564.36s -> 9566.81s]  This is not good.
[9569.18s -> 9570.62s]  How the hell am I gonna do this?
[9571.50s -> 9574.90s]  All right, they start here.
[9583.00s -> 9583.32s]  No!
[9585.40s -> 9586.44s]  I just lost their mind.
[9590.97s -> 9593.13s]  Why is everybody freaking out?
[9598.30s -> 9599.82s]  Oh, I gotta pay attention.
[9599.82s -> 9601.02s]  All right, I'll...
[9601.02s -> 9602.70s]  We'll have a chat later.
[9604.49s -> 9616.23s]  Cross here in town.
[9618.39s -> 9626.20s]  I'm good.
[9626.20s -> 9626.60s]  I got...
[9626.60s -> 9627.32s]  Almost halfway there.
[9627.32s -> 9627.96s]  I got plenty of time.
[9630.38s -> 9631.10s]  Oh, dear.
[9631.10s -> 9633.02s]  This platforming involved in this.
[9635.22s -> 9636.42s]  Platforming is involved.
[9637.06s -> 9638.55s]  I thought it was just driving.
[9641.90s -> 9642.70s]  Oh, shit.
[9648.52s -> 9648.76s]  Shit.
[9648.76s -> 9649.16s]  How do I...
[9655.08s -> 9655.72s]  Get up there.
[9655.72s -> 9656.20s]  I see it.
[9656.20s -> 9656.76s]  It's right here.
[9668.89s -> 9669.37s]  That's it.
[9670.31s -> 9670.95s]  Turn around.
[9672.04s -> 9673.40s]  Any more on top of roofs or anything?
[9677.18s -> 9677.82s]  In the car.
[9689.54s -> 9695.70s]  17, 18, 19.
[9702.25s -> 9702.73s]  Come on.
[9703.53s -> 9704.25s]  Get through there.
[9711.45s -> 9712.09s]  I got plenty of time.
[9712.09s -> 9713.13s]  Just don't freak out about it.
[9718.94s -> 9723.32s]  I'm still missing five.
[9726.07s -> 9727.43s]  Where on earth are the other five?
[9728.31s -> 9729.54s]  Forget about the B.
[9729.54s -> 9730.26s]  It's not important.
[9737.51s -> 9738.71s]  Jump to light speed.
[9738.71s -> 9739.03s]  Bark.
[9739.75s -> 9740.55s]  That doesn't exist.
[9741.35s -> 9749.35s]  I got it.
[9749.35s -> 9758.20s]  And then end it on the stairs.
[9759.24s -> 9764.94s]  All right.
[9764.94s -> 9765.50s]  That was not...
[9765.50s -> 9766.30s]  I didn't need to panic at all.
[9766.30s -> 9766.70s]  That was...
[9766.70s -> 9767.02s]  I'm done.
[9769.11s -> 9771.43s]  Drive to the Screaming Monkey Medical Center.
[9771.43s -> 9771.67s]  What?
[9784.50s -> 9784.90s]  Got it.
[9792.68s -> 9793.48s]  Don't deliver them.
[9798.38s -> 9799.42s]  Why wouldn't I deliver them?
[9810.14s -> 9810.78s]  Oh, I see.
[9814.10s -> 9815.22s]  I kind of like the plow.
[9815.22s -> 9816.58s]  I didn't like it at first, but now I do.
[9824.70s -> 9825.58s]  I'm back.
[9833.02s -> 9837.98s]  Unfortunately, there are too many people using cell phones, and the interference would then
[9837.98s -> 9841.10s]  cause the monster to malfunction and kill many people.
[9841.10s -> 9843.34s]  What were the popular cell phones that existed back then?
[9847.34s -> 9847.74s]  This is what?
[9847.74s -> 9848.46s]  2004?
[9850.12s -> 9851.48s]  Was the original iPhone even out?
[9854.81s -> 9858.09s]  Destroy all the cell phone users' cars before time runs out.
[9860.09s -> 9860.81s]  Get into your car.
[9863.54s -> 9865.62s]  No, this is like old flip phones, right?
[9868.74s -> 9880.41s]  This is going to be a horrible mission.
[9883.77s -> 9884.81s]  She just baited me.
[9885.45s -> 9886.25s]  So bad.
[9886.89s -> 9888.49s]  Did you really just do that to me?
[9896.10s -> 9897.70s]  Phones that are attached to cars.
[9899.72s -> 9900.92s]  You motherfucker.
[9900.92s -> 9901.72s]  I swear to God.
[9911.54s -> 9912.04s]  No!
[9924.09s -> 9929.38s]  Look at how easy that is.
[9930.10s -> 9933.58s]  It's almost done.
[9936.84s -> 9938.36s]  Great alien music, too.
[9939.24s -> 9948.54s]  You should be done.
[9949.26s -> 9949.90s]  You should be dead.
[9952.70s -> 9953.94s]  Destroy?
[9953.94s -> 9955.38s]  Ah, there's another one back here.
[9956.42s -> 9959.06s]  Are you turning around?
[9959.06s -> 9959.86s]  What way are you driving?
[9960.58s -> 9964.73s]  Oh, dummy.
[9964.73s -> 9965.37s]  Get out of the way.
[9966.09s -> 9974.12s]  Where are you going?
[9976.01s -> 9976.41s]  Perfect.
[9976.97s -> 9982.44s]  I think time is added for every car that's destroyed.
[9982.44s -> 9983.40s]  That would be really bad if it didn't.
[9984.12s -> 9993.88s]  I think my face cam's not on.
[9993.88s -> 9995.24s]  That would have been an embarrassing face.
[10008.39s -> 10011.34s]  I just bit down on my low emote.
[10012.14s -> 10014.14s]  I like ate the bottom half of my mouth.
[10015.18s -> 10026.49s]  Fucking tubers.
[10036.92s -> 10043.05s]  That's fucking tubers.
[10048.58s -> 10049.14s]  Get em!
[10049.14s -> 10050.10s]  Would you just get em?
[10072.10s -> 10073.14s]  Why does that not count?
[10073.78s -> 10074.82s]  My car is going to explode.
[10074.82s -> 10075.38s]  I need a wrench.
[10076.18s -> 10082.39s]  I just know I'm going to be blind for this.
[10082.39s -> 10083.13s]  I got it.
[10083.75s -> 10084.54s]  All right.
[10084.54s -> 10085.10s]  Where's the wrench?
[10086.46s -> 10087.88s]  There's a wrench up here, I think.
[10088.68s -> 10091.51s]  Right at the top, right?
[10091.51s -> 10092.01s]  Yep.
[10094.01s -> 10094.81s]  Stupid!
[10095.77s -> 10096.65s]  You're stupid!
[10099.03s -> 10099.35s]  All right.
[10099.35s -> 10099.83s]  You're fine.
[10099.83s -> 10100.31s]  You're smart.
[10106.71s -> 10107.21s]  Stupid!
[10110.79s -> 10111.91s]  Full throttle, right in the back.
[10112.55s -> 10118.50s]  It's no damage at all.
[10119.78s -> 10122.26s]  His car used my car as a brake.
[10125.77s -> 10126.57s]  Now, all the way around.
[10127.21s -> 10136.18s]  Come here.
[10136.74s -> 10138.04s]  Come here.
[10149.75s -> 10151.32s]  Are you going to...
[10151.32s -> 10151.56s]  All right.
[10151.56s -> 10152.52s]  He's doing it to himself.
[10152.52s -> 10153.02s]  Good.
[10153.88s -> 10154.38s]  I win.
[10155.72s -> 10161.58s]  There's a sign right here.
[10161.58s -> 10162.08s]  Got it.
[10162.54s -> 10164.79s]  I got three and a half minutes.
[10165.35s -> 10165.91s]  3.50.
[10165.91s -> 10166.31s]  I'm good to go.
[10166.87s -> 10168.26s]  Just going to wrap around.
[10173.13s -> 10174.01s]  That vision sucked.
[10174.41s -> 10176.25s]  Hey, slower traffic to the right, please.
[10176.97s -> 10180.70s]  What a hard one next time.
[10181.26s -> 10182.23s]  That was a hard one.
[10186.60s -> 10188.82s]  Well done, sociopath.
[10189.38s -> 10191.14s]  Is this the actual game's music?
[10191.14s -> 10194.82s]  Now there is no chance my truckasaurus will go on a killing rampage
[10194.82s -> 10198.58s]  with the screaming and the sadness and the hosing of blood off the robot.
[10199.38s -> 10200.90s]  If you stay in your car when it blows up,
[10200.90s -> 10202.50s]  you can drive around in a blown-up car.
[10204.78s -> 10205.28s]  Really.
[10205.34s -> 10210.38s]  The source is some kind of truck slash dinosaur.
[10210.38s -> 10211.42s]  I never would have guessed.
[10216.73s -> 10217.29s]  First boss.
[10234.52s -> 10235.80s]  Jimmy Neutron dog.
[10240.04s -> 10241.40s]  What's the dog's name from Jimmy Neutron?
[10242.04s -> 10244.01s]  Gertrude or something?
[10249.98s -> 10250.48s]  Goddard.
[10251.26s -> 10259.80s]  Did I just get abducted?
[10264.18s -> 10266.02s]  707, 101, 33.
[10266.98s -> 10269.32s]  I didn't get any new clothes for Bart.
[10280.50s -> 10281.86s]  No new clothes for Bart.
[10282.42s -> 10283.69s]  It's time for Lisa.
[10284.33s -> 10284.83s]  Yep.
[10292.87s -> 10294.87s]  I get Lisa's car, which is the best car in the game.
[10298.55s -> 10302.22s]  Might as well look and see what the other costumes are.
[10303.56s -> 10304.44s]  Lisa, cool.
[10312.04s -> 10312.54s]  Hockey.
[10316.10s -> 10319.56s]  I mean, I'd have to get that.
[10320.36s -> 10325.45s]  Toy train?
[10325.45s -> 10326.73s]  I know what it's like to build one of those.
[10330.95s -> 10332.71s]  Is there a dead person in that costume?
[10336.31s -> 10337.91s]  It is the YouTuber outfit, you're right.
[10337.91s -> 10339.27s]  This is the streamer outfit.
[10345.24s -> 10346.52s]  Funny streamer outfit.
[10346.52s -> 10347.02s]  Yeah, it is.
[10347.10s -> 10351.26s]  Now, I must get the last copy of the new Itchy and Scratchy Adventures comic.
[10351.26s -> 10354.70s]  It's the controversial issue in which they finally kiss.
[10354.70s -> 10357.02s]  Assist me and I will aid you with your dilemma.
[10359.87s -> 10361.71s]  Raise the nerd to the Itchy and Scratchy store.
[10361.71s -> 10363.63s]  Get the comic book back before time runs out.
[10364.67s -> 10367.69s]  Oh, it's a different nerd.
[10367.69s -> 10368.09s]  There's like...
[10368.89s -> 10371.26s]  I don't like the nerd car.
[10401.20s -> 10401.92s]  Impatient.
[10403.21s -> 10404.17s]  No, I just don't.
[10404.17s -> 10405.37s]  That's a guaranteed loss.
[10406.09s -> 10423.29s]  I'm so far ahead of them.
[10430.94s -> 10431.66s]  Should I go over this?
[10456.72s -> 10457.36s]  Got the comic.
[10460.24s -> 10461.12s]  Oh, shit.
[10465.39s -> 10466.83s]  They don't let you take a break.
[10466.83s -> 10467.23s]  It's just...
[10467.95s -> 10469.47s]  Now it's time to go fast again.
[10470.27s -> 10474.09s]  You have to go really fast.
[10474.73s -> 10482.70s]  They stopped.
[10483.50s -> 10484.70s]  My squishy.
[10484.70s -> 10485.20s]  Sorry.
[10490.36s -> 10490.86s]  No.
[10493.34s -> 10493.84s]  No.
[10496.68s -> 10497.18s]  No.
[10515.34s -> 10516.46s]  Nice spill joke.
[10517.18s -> 10522.22s]  Get this inky treasure into its mylar sanctuary.
[10522.22s -> 10523.82s]  What a bad start.
[10523.82s -> 10525.82s]  I asked you, have you seen him?
[10525.82s -> 10528.22s]  I think I saw him at the Noiseland arcade.
[10529.58s -> 10530.62s]  Video games.
[10530.62s -> 10532.30s]  What a waste of money.
[10532.46s -> 10537.50s]  Now to go online and bid $1,000 for itchy and scratchy corncob holders.
[10537.50s -> 10539.18s]  A terrific, terrific expense.
[10540.30s -> 10541.87s]  I am the queen.
[10548.25s -> 10548.97s]  Oh, really?
[10550.33s -> 10552.17s]  I don't think you're going to be doing that anytime soon.
[10560.32s -> 10560.72s]  Hold on.
[10561.36s -> 10562.32s]  I don't want to do this yet.
[10563.58s -> 10570.38s]  Don't you mind looking around?
[10570.38s -> 10571.50s]  There's money everywhere.
[10573.00s -> 10573.96s]  Secrets.
[10573.96s -> 10574.68s]  Gags.
[10574.68s -> 10577.80s]  I don't want to just blow through the whole video game.
[10578.52s -> 10582.32s]  Plus, I gotta pee.
[10583.74s -> 10584.30s]  Don't you know?
[10584.94s -> 10589.34s]  That Jeremy goes pee every two to three hours on the dot.
[10589.90s -> 10591.69s]  Which is what happens.
[10592.25s -> 10593.61s]  I missed a coin.
[10593.61s -> 10594.41s]  Who cares?
[10594.41s -> 10597.36s]  All right, the machine over there.
[10598.00s -> 10600.76s]  What is this?
[10600.76s -> 10601.26s]  Gag.
[10601.88s -> 10613.04s]  It's time for a meltdown.
[10615.34s -> 10616.62s]  Is this a meltdown mission?
[10616.62s -> 10617.34s]  I don't know if it is.
[10626.94s -> 10627.98s]  Please change the outfit.
[10627.98s -> 10629.18s]  It sucks.
[10629.18s -> 10629.68s]  Thanks.
[10632.33s -> 10633.13s]  No, I can't.
[10633.13s -> 10634.09s]  Not that quickly.
[10634.09s -> 10635.37s]  This is $250.
[10635.37s -> 10639.16s]  Am I old enough to drink coffee yet?
[10639.16s -> 10640.36s]  Not until you're like 16.
[10641.00s -> 10645.76s]  You don't want to drink coffee until you're at least like 15 or 16 at least.
[10656.83s -> 10657.33s]  Ooh.
[10661.55s -> 10662.11s]  Why is that?
[10662.11s -> 10667.63s]  Because I started drinking coffee when I was 20.
[10670.49s -> 10672.09s]  I just look like Gumby.
[10672.09s -> 10673.85s]  Didn't Gumby drive around in a car like this?
[10674.65s -> 10680.76s]  All right, I gotta pee.
[10681.92s -> 10682.56s]  I'll be right back.
[10683.12s -> 10686.04s]  See you in like three minutes.
[10687.26s -> 10688.14s]  Beer be...
[10688.14s -> 10839.26s]  Let's go.
[10839.26s -> 10840.62s]  Don't scare me like that.
[10841.18s -> 10841.42s]  What?
[10841.42s -> 10842.86s]  I muted the mic and I just went,
[10842.86s -> 10850.01s]  Hey, what is Lisa's double jump?
[10850.01s -> 10852.01s]  Hold on, let me just open this fresh beer.
[10863.95s -> 10864.45s]  Ooh.
[10872.25s -> 10873.29s]  It's a ginger ale.
[10874.33s -> 10874.89s]  Relax.
[10876.06s -> 10877.26s]  It's a Canada Dry.
[10887.44s -> 10887.84s]  Prove it.
[10887.84s -> 10888.16s]  I can't.
[10888.16s -> 10889.04s]  I don't have any clothes on.
[10891.53s -> 10893.61s]  I'm gonna go like wrap a blanket around myself
[10893.61s -> 10895.45s]  and then turn the camera off for a second.
[10895.45s -> 10898.33s]  Well, that somehow fucked me up completely.
[10903.39s -> 10910.65s]  At least his car is the best.
[10910.65s -> 10914.33s]  Oh, I don't know why you just freaked me out doing that, but you did.
[10925.42s -> 10929.15s]  Are you really coming up behind me right now?
[10930.91s -> 10931.55s]  Oh, what?
[10934.28s -> 10935.00s]  Easy.
[10935.00s -> 10935.40s]  All right.
[10935.40s -> 10936.84s]  I gotta be careful going down.
[10936.84s -> 10938.20s]  And you went perfectly down there.
[10939.42s -> 10940.30s]  No way.
[10940.30s -> 10941.50s]  I don't believe that for a second.
[10947.45s -> 10949.87s]  You're in second place, Lisa.
[10953.28s -> 10953.92s]  All right.
[10953.92s -> 10955.28s]  Now go down gently.
[10956.08s -> 10969.26s]  I can still get it.
[10970.91s -> 10972.27s]  Still pretty, pretty possible.
[10976.30s -> 10976.94s]  Okay.
[10976.94s -> 10977.34s]  Easy.
[10978.38s -> 10979.38s]  Got it.
[10980.62s -> 10981.58s]  Oh, it's gonna be close.
[10983.39s -> 10984.27s]  Right up my ass.
[10984.75s -> 11001.56s]  Oh, what are you doing?
[11001.56s -> 11002.44s]  Oh, it's oh.
[11002.44s -> 11004.12s]  I'm speechless, Lisa.
[11004.12s -> 11006.44s]  That was better than you have any right to do.
[11008.20s -> 11013.02s]  We're good.
[11013.02s -> 11020.75s]  Can I get my car back, please?
[11020.75s -> 11021.23s]  Thank you.
[11021.87s -> 11025.23s]  What is this?
[11025.23s -> 11025.71s]  Bonus.
[11032.59s -> 11033.60s]  Gone?
[11033.60s -> 11034.56s]  What a tragedy.
[11035.20s -> 11037.84s]  To get your mind off this terrible loss which we all feel,
[11037.84s -> 11041.44s]  why don't you run a few errands or as I call them grief helpers for me.
[11041.44s -> 11043.04s]  But Bart's only missing.
[11043.04s -> 11044.88s]  Well, looking for that little monster.
[11044.88s -> 11047.52s]  I mean, treasure can't help anything.
[11049.04s -> 11050.24s]  Skinner looks like a bird.
[11052.96s -> 11055.20s]  Lisa Simpson at your service.
[11055.20s -> 11059.32s]  Now you might as well pick up my dry cleaning for me.
[11062.04s -> 11064.60s]  You might as well pick up my dry.
[11064.60s -> 11066.44s]  No, never mind.
[11066.44s -> 11070.25s]  You're ruining the tires, Seymour.
[11070.25s -> 11070.81s]  I'm not.
[11070.81s -> 11072.78s]  Fine, mother.
[11073.34s -> 11074.62s]  Fine, mother.
[11074.62s -> 11074.86s]  No.
[11075.90s -> 11077.56s]  It's so hard.
[11077.56s -> 11079.48s]  It's real hard to do that on an empty stomach.
[11079.48s -> 11080.60s]  Whatever you say, mother.
[11081.56s -> 11084.84s]  You've got to eat a shitload of like greasy food before you can do that voice.
[11085.48s -> 11086.20s]  Here we are.
[11086.20s -> 11091.58s]  This clean house dress is an old lady on principle Skinner.
[11091.58s -> 11093.74s]  I really should get back to my search.
[11093.74s -> 11096.06s]  Maybe these gold stars will change your mind.
[11096.62s -> 11099.34s]  And to the stream voice of what are you on about.
[11100.46s -> 11103.28s]  I'm still enjoying the Simpsons hit and run video game.
[11103.28s -> 11104.96s]  Why would I turn the stream off right now?
[11105.84s -> 11112.20s]  Care for a steamed ab?
[11115.04s -> 11118.48s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[11119.96s -> 11121.32s]  I've seen that video.
[11121.32s -> 11122.44s]  I have nine seconds.
[11122.60s -> 11124.44s]  It's like candy to me.
[11124.44s -> 11125.72s]  The more the.
[11125.72s -> 11126.76s]  Yes, mother.
[11126.76s -> 11127.56s]  Sweet.
[11127.56s -> 11138.36s]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[11139.71s -> 11140.19s]  Stupid.
[11140.19s -> 11141.39s]  The worst driver than you.
[11141.39s -> 11142.03s]  Yes, mother.
[11144.60s -> 11145.88s]  Are we in Europe?
[11146.68s -> 11148.20s]  How am I a bad driver?
[11148.20s -> 11149.56s]  It's principle Skinner driving.
[11154.56s -> 11156.56s]  But I have seen the hams video.
[11156.56s -> 11158.17s]  Oh no.
[11158.17s -> 11160.43s]  I swallowed my gum to the emergency room.
[11161.15s -> 11162.33s]  I've seen it before.
[11164.59s -> 11167.79s]  Wow, mother loves clean house dresses and old lady underwear.
[11167.79s -> 11170.75s]  Principal Skinner, I really should get back to my search.
[11170.75s -> 11173.07s]  Maybe these gold stars will change your mind.
[11174.51s -> 11175.55s]  All right.
[11175.55s -> 11177.79s]  I can't believe he's playing my childhood game.
[11185.40s -> 11186.44s]  It holds up pretty well.
[11187.68s -> 11188.40s]  It kind of does.
[11192.04s -> 11193.08s]  If this was on the PlayStation.
[11193.08s -> 11194.36s]  This isn't on PC, by the way.
[11195.00s -> 11197.47s]  I have it for PlayStation 2.
[11198.35s -> 11201.79s]  But I feel like it would be better on PC.
[11201.79s -> 11202.91s]  The graphics and shit.
[11205.05s -> 11211.15s]  The PS2 version runs at like 20 FPS.
[11211.15s -> 11212.51s]  That probably would have been unbearable to watch.
[11212.51s -> 11213.95s]  I need principal Skinner's dinner.
[11214.03s -> 11215.31s]  Here, do you want to try a new-
[11217.31s -> 11218.91s]  I'm a vegetarian.
[11218.91s -> 11220.51s]  Oh, there's no meat in it.
[11220.51s -> 11222.19s]  Just paste an MSG.
[11227.37s -> 11227.85s]  Hold on.
[11233.85s -> 11234.57s]  All right, I think I'm okay.
[11236.28s -> 11237.08s]  Now I'm going to sneeze.
[11239.52s -> 11241.12s]  Do you guys ever choke on air?
[11244.14s -> 11247.58s]  I just talked and I said too many words on my throat.
[11247.58s -> 11249.98s]  And I just choked on my own voice.
[11252.76s -> 11254.67s]  Where's my car?
[11259.15s -> 11262.22s]  Principal Skinner, I can't help me.
[11262.22s -> 11262.78s]  Oh, the casino.
[11262.78s -> 11263.90s]  To search for Bart.
[11263.90s -> 11267.34s]  Lisa, I apologize from the bottom of my Vietnam veteran's heart.
[11267.90s -> 11270.54s]  I promise this next stop will be the last.
[11270.54s -> 11272.22s]  I don't like everything's timed out.
[11272.22s -> 11273.18s]  Everything's timed.
[11273.90s -> 11275.10s]  It makes it too stressful.
[11277.26s -> 11278.83s]  Let the city pay for it.
[11279.87s -> 11288.81s]  I'm missing a place to jump down quickly, I think.
[11289.45s -> 11296.67s]  It's right ahead.
[11297.31s -> 11299.93s]  This is right-
[11299.93s -> 11300.97s]  Okay, I'm going to get it, right?
[11300.97s -> 11301.61s]  The jump.
[11301.61s -> 11302.33s]  No, it's right there.
[11303.05s -> 11314.16s]  I don't have the timer anymore.
[11314.32s -> 11315.28s]  Soiled myself.
[11317.95s -> 11319.31s]  Why did I try that move?
[11319.87s -> 11321.31s]  Perhaps it was hubris.
[11322.35s -> 11322.85s]  Okay.
[11325.13s -> 11325.77s]  Relax.
[11325.77s -> 11326.33s]  Get up there.
[11327.21s -> 11333.84s]  I just have to go near it and activate it.
[11337.66s -> 11338.94s]  I forgot I was this character.
[11339.58s -> 11345.23s]  Principal Skinner's personal items.
[11345.23s -> 11346.43s]  Hi, little girl.
[11346.43s -> 11347.71s]  Hi, you're so cute.
[11347.71s -> 11350.59s]  Here's the principal's anti-fungal cream.
[11350.59s -> 11351.09s]  Ew.
[11351.79s -> 11354.64s]  Thank you.
[11357.37s -> 11358.81s]  Push him into the ocean.
[11358.81s -> 11382.19s]  That wasn't even worth the jump.
[11382.19s -> 11382.83s]  That was fun.
[11383.63s -> 11384.91s]  I can't believe that one.
[11388.04s -> 11391.56s]  That one over me taking 15 minutes
[11392.60s -> 11396.20s]  to sync up and queue up a Nightcrawler line from X-Men 2.
[11397.40s -> 11397.90s]  Really?
[11398.44s -> 11405.26s]  Speaking of fucking really-
[11405.26s -> 11407.18s]  You tried like a girl.
[11407.18s -> 11408.46s]  A handicapped one.
[11408.46s -> 11409.26s]  Yes, mother-
[11412.51s -> 11412.83s]  No!
[11412.83s -> 11413.33s]  What the-
[11428.03s -> 11428.67s]  I pressed-
[11428.67s -> 11430.27s]  Like, ah, they came up so-
[11431.15s -> 11431.65s]  Whatever.
[11432.35s -> 11433.93s]  I could be so angry at this.
[11434.65s -> 11436.08s]  God dammit.
[11439.26s -> 11439.76s]  Ah.
[11440.86s -> 11447.36s]  I don't-
[11447.36s -> 11447.86s]  Wait.
[11449.55s -> 11450.83s]  Can you just fail missions?
[11450.83s -> 11453.60s]  I'm milking here.
[11453.60s -> 11455.96s]  Haven't seen him.
[11455.96s -> 11458.35s]  Frozen yogurt?
[11458.35s -> 11458.85s]  You just don't finish them.
[11458.85s -> 11460.27s]  I'm throwing two dry toppings.
[11460.27s -> 11466.97s]  I'd be a Wally Weasels.
[11466.97s -> 11468.97s]  He likes the smell of the ball cage.
[11470.86s -> 11471.50s]  So I just-
[11471.50s -> 11473.02s]  I can't do that one again.
[11473.02s -> 11473.82s]  I just skipped it.
[11474.46s -> 11476.54s]  Oh.
[11476.54s -> 11482.75s]  The time for action is now-
[11482.75s -> 11483.55s]  Who's driving the car?
[11484.43s -> 11485.39s]  It's some millhouse, is it?
[11488.83s -> 11491.76s]  Hey, what?
[11491.76s -> 11492.96s]  Wasn't I just talking to you?
[11493.92s -> 11496.64s]  Mmm, smell that fresh air.
[11496.64s -> 11497.12s]  I was just-
[11497.12s -> 11497.76s]  Millhouse?
[11497.76s -> 11498.08s]  I was-
[11498.08s -> 11499.04s]  What are you doing here?
[11499.04s -> 11499.68s]  What's going on?
[11499.68s -> 11500.64s]  Lisa!
[11500.64s -> 11502.32s]  What a coincidence.
[11502.32s -> 11504.88s]  Hey, is that a new dress?
[11504.88s -> 11507.28s]  No, I've been wearing this dress for years.
[11507.28s -> 11508.24s]  Now, where's Bart?
[11509.60s -> 11511.28s]  I think he's at the Planet Hype.
[11511.28s -> 11511.78s]  Stop.
[11519.15s -> 11520.27s]  Drive to Planet Hype.
[11521.32s -> 11522.68s]  Uh, do they go back into-
[11522.68s -> 11523.32s]  In the chat, please?
[11524.12s -> 11546.84s]  Can't go that way.
[11547.56s -> 11554.49s]  You idiot, get out of my way.
[11559.34s -> 11567.45s]  I'm not gonna make it.
[11568.09s -> 11568.89s]  I'm not gonna make it.
[11568.89s -> 11570.01s]  I'm not gonna make it.
[11570.01s -> 11570.81s]  I'm not gonna make it.
[11571.61s -> 11572.84s]  I'm not gonna make it.
[11594.83s -> 11605.18s]  What just happened to all my money?
[11607.71s -> 11608.21s]  What?
[11608.59s -> 11620.62s]  How much money did it take?
[11622.54s -> 11625.08s]  They just took so much money from me.
[11625.96s -> 11639.95s]  I'm here.
[11639.95s -> 11640.45s]  Pegasus.
[11641.47s -> 11642.43s]  I'm just going through here.
[11658.94s -> 11669.55s]  I thought it was a shortcut and I could go through.
[11670.27s -> 11671.15s]  Apparently not.
[11672.11s -> 11684.04s]  Apparently not.
[11684.60s -> 11687.34s]  Speaking of shortcuts,
[11687.34s -> 11687.90s]  this one right-
[11687.90s -> 11688.86s]  I missed it already.
[11689.42s -> 11696.46s]  There's another one right there.
[11697.18s -> 11711.82s]  Is this gonna work if I go over this?
[11712.54s -> 11716.22s]  Because I had to go down all the way to the beach.
[11716.22s -> 11717.10s]  Can I drive through this?
[11732.38s -> 11733.26s]  Before I do this.
[11733.90s -> 11735.69s]  Get the car in the right spot, please.
[11735.69s -> 11736.57s]  I need speed.
[11736.57s -> 11737.29s]  More speed!
[11737.93s -> 11746.08s]  Efficient to drown.
[11747.05s -> 11747.55s]  Maybe.
[11755.13s -> 11759.24s]  I pulled-
[11759.24s -> 11760.92s]  No, there's no way to pull left here.
[11760.92s -> 11761.72s]  Except to stay here.
[11763.80s -> 11766.20s]  Straight down and then there's-
[11766.20s -> 11767.56s]  I don't know if that's a little shortcut
[11767.56s -> 11769.24s]  that I can go through with the Krusty Clown thing.
[11770.67s -> 11771.87s]  It looks like it,
[11771.87s -> 11773.31s]  but maybe I went the wrong way?
[11774.19s -> 11781.58s]  I mean, it looks like I can go through here.
[11784.14s -> 11784.78s]  No, I can't.
[11784.78s -> 11785.74s]  It's just a debate.
[11785.74s -> 11786.54s]  It's bullshit.
[11786.54s -> 11787.26s]  It's horse shit.
[11788.46s -> 11789.34s]  It's just horse shit.
[11798.48s -> 11799.36s]  That's gonna happen again.
[11801.85s -> 11803.85s]  Oh my lord in heaven, give me a break.
[11803.85s -> 11804.57s]  Oh my god.
[11812.03s -> 11814.03s]  You have a gift for speed.
[11814.03s -> 11834.25s]  This reminds me of when I was a little girl.
[11834.25s -> 11835.61s]  I don't want you a shitty car.
[11836.17s -> 11837.87s]  Give me back my good car.
[11838.59s -> 11839.68s]  Where's a phone?
[11840.32s -> 11850.17s]  I should have paid more in the gym.
[11850.17s -> 11852.73s]  Give me the Lisa Simpson best car in the game car, please.
[11864.35s -> 11865.47s]  Oh, come on!
[11866.43s -> 11870.32s]  Give me a wrench so I can have-
[11870.32s -> 11873.68s]  Oh, there's a card up there,
[11873.68s -> 11874.88s]  but you know what?
[11874.88s -> 11875.44s]  Here's a wrench.
[11876.16s -> 11882.51s]  Sweet, these are recyclable.
[11882.51s -> 11903.20s]  Can't turn that way.
[11915.66s -> 11917.42s]  All right, I'm gonna try.
[11917.42s -> 11918.62s]  I got enough speed, I think.
[11922.43s -> 11924.27s]  Oh shit, I made it.
[11924.27s -> 11924.91s]  I did it, I did it.
[11924.91s -> 11925.79s]  Okay, we're fine.
[11925.79s -> 11926.59s]  Everything's fine.
[11927.88s -> 11930.44s]  No, now we relax.
[11934.64s -> 11935.44s]  I'm ready.
[11935.44s -> 11937.85s]  This is the last time I'm gonna do this shit.
[11937.85s -> 11938.41s]  Here we go.
[11938.97s -> 11939.47s]  Go.
[11950.17s -> 11950.67s]  Don't-
[11951.45s -> 11953.37s]  I can't just drive on the boardwalk like this
[11953.37s -> 11954.17s]  and not get in trouble.
[11959.72s -> 11960.97s]  There we go.
[11960.97s -> 11961.47s]  Go.
[11962.65s -> 11964.81s]  Don't go through the fake shortcut.
[11964.81s -> 11965.53s]  It's not real.
[11966.09s -> 11966.97s]  Just drive there.
[11967.77s -> 11981.08s]  What is happening with the car?
[11981.72s -> 11988.22s]  I did it.
[11988.92s -> 11996.68s]  All right, Mailhouse, what do you got?
[12008.64s -> 12009.68s]  Kick him into the water, no.
[12015.79s -> 12017.15s]  Okay, this is the end of the mission that I will.
[12020.28s -> 12022.06s]  All right, mission complete.
[12031.36s -> 12031.86s]  Oh.
[12032.32s -> 12049.88s]  All right, I'm going for it.
[12050.84s -> 12051.64s]  No, never mind.
[12052.60s -> 12054.04s]  I was trying to drop the car on him.
[12054.04s -> 12055.40s]  Why am I doing that to Mailhouse?
[12055.40s -> 12055.96s]  Just drive.
[12057.08s -> 12064.17s]  Drop like a car on him.
[12064.17s -> 12076.25s]  Nobody likes Mailhouse.
[12076.81s -> 12078.01s]  Somebody does.
[12078.65s -> 12080.28s]  I'm sure somebody does.
[12086.56s -> 12087.04s]  I do?
[12087.04s -> 12087.52s]  Yeah, I see.
[12088.32s -> 12090.43s]  Hold on a minute.
[12090.43s -> 12096.49s]  What's this shit right here?
[12096.49s -> 12096.99s]  Look at that.
[12100.11s -> 12100.75s]  Platforming?
[12101.85s -> 12103.61s]  Oh, would you look at that.
[12103.61s -> 12110.19s]  Hey, almost fell off.
[12110.19s -> 12120.88s]  The geyser.
[12123.32s -> 12124.20s]  Evil braces.
[12125.08s -> 12128.03s]  Ooh, something else over here.
[12128.59s -> 12134.88s]  What's this?
[12135.52s -> 12143.37s]  Don't get cocky here, because I want to see what this is.
[12144.01s -> 12146.64s]  Okay, I got them all.
[12147.20s -> 12153.74s]  Whoa, where am I?
[12153.74s -> 12164.89s]  Oh, that's a little area that you're not supposed to find.
[12169.53s -> 12170.33s]  All right, well, cool.
[12170.33s -> 12170.81s]  Anything else?
[12171.61s -> 12173.05s]  Don't forget that one coin.
[12173.05s -> 12174.25s]  People will scream at you.
[12175.21s -> 12176.27s]  That's cool.
[12181.28s -> 12182.40s]  Why is there no selfie mode?
[12182.96s -> 12190.92s]  Ginger ale riot.
[12190.92s -> 12192.44s]  Oh, God, hold on.
[12192.44s -> 12230.24s]  Can I even turn this on from here?
[12239.12s -> 12240.00s]  This crashes the game.
[12240.00s -> 12247.10s]  I'm going to be very upset with you guys.
[12247.10s -> 12247.74s]  See?
[12247.74s -> 12266.16s]  It's off, right?
[12266.16s -> 12274.08s]  Yeah.
[12274.08s -> 12276.68s]  What?
[12276.68s -> 12277.96s]  Save, save, save.
[12277.96s -> 12278.60s]  It's all right.
[12278.60s -> 12280.75s]  I don't think there's a problem.
[12280.75s -> 12282.35s]  I just thought the camera was still on.
[12282.35s -> 12284.03s]  Thank God it's not.
[12284.03s -> 12290.99s]  We good?
[12290.99s -> 12291.63s]  Did I, I didn't.
[12291.63s -> 12292.99s]  Did I fucking crash it?
[12292.99s -> 12293.95s]  I hope not.
[12293.95s -> 12295.55s]  When was the last time I saved the game?
[12295.55s -> 12296.67s]  Why did that have to happen?
[12300.76s -> 12301.48s]  God damn it.
[12302.36s -> 12303.32s]  Un-fucking-believable.
[12316.49s -> 12317.37s]  Oh, no.
[12317.37s -> 12318.09s]  That's not good.
[12318.73s -> 12320.01s]  Wait, hold on, hold on.
[12320.01s -> 12320.97s]  It might not be crashed.
[12329.87s -> 12330.75s]  It just might need a second.
[12331.39s -> 12348.94s]  Hold on.
[12348.94s -> 12349.82s]  Come on.
[12349.82s -> 12350.46s]  It's coming back.
[12350.46s -> 12351.34s]  It's got the black screen.
[12351.34s -> 12352.14s]  It looks like it's trying.
[12352.14s -> 12356.96s]  Come on.
[12356.96s -> 12357.92s]  Come on.
[12357.92s -> 12370.52s]  What have I done?
[12370.52s -> 12402.16s]  I don't know how far back that save is
[12402.16s -> 12409.98s]  because I had to alt tab and prove that I'm not drinking alcohol.
[12409.98s -> 12411.02s]  God damn it.
[12411.02s -> 12433.37s]  I think my whole computer is broken.
[12433.37s -> 12456.14s]  Well, give me a fucking break.
[12456.14s -> 12466.03s]  I'm going to try it again.
[12473.04s -> 12474.32s]  Fucking come on.
[12474.32s -> 12475.20s]  Really?
[12475.20s -> 12480.44s]  I can't believe that.
[12480.44s -> 12482.99s]  That's absolute bullshit.
[12482.99s -> 12484.19s]  God damn it.
[12484.19s -> 12489.31s]  And now I can't get the fucking game to launch.
[12489.31s -> 12497.80s]  You got to be kidding me.
[12498.68s -> 12500.68s]  The game physically won't launch.
[12500.68s -> 12517.48s]  I might have to restart my computer.
[12517.48s -> 12531.85s]  No, it's not in the task manager.
[12531.85s -> 12536.78s]  It was just going so well and I had to alt tab.
[12536.78s -> 12545.23s]  I'm going to try one more thing.
[12545.23s -> 12552.64s]  And then, oh, I'm so angry right now.
[12552.64s -> 12554.72s]  Of course, I hit the fucking alt tab button
[12554.72s -> 12557.29s]  and the whole stream has to turn off.
[12557.29s -> 12558.25s]  God damn it.
[12558.25s -> 12582.03s]  Let's try it again.
[12626.65s -> 12628.09s]  No, it's not in the task manager.
[12628.09s -> 12629.45s]  It's just, for some reason,
[12629.45s -> 12631.29s]  it doesn't think I have DirectX anymore.
[12631.29s -> 12647.52s]  I'm going to have to restart the computer unless I can...
[12648.96s -> 12649.20s]  No.
[12649.76s -> 12656.52s]  This is going to kill the whole stream, too.
[12657.32s -> 12658.36s]  I'm going to have a pain in the ass.
[12670.75s -> 12671.39s]  All right.
[12671.39s -> 12678.91s]  No, no, no.
[12678.91s -> 12680.99s]  Don't change my password on...
[12680.99s -> 12681.39s]  What do you want?
[12681.39s -> 12684.89s]  What am I doing?
[12684.89s -> 12688.81s]  It might be because OBS is still running and it's...
[12688.81s -> 12689.53s]  I don't know.
[12689.53s -> 12695.28s]  I'm trying to find it in the task manager
[12695.28s -> 12696.56s]  and I don't see anything here.
[12696.56s -> 12723.02s]  Oh, I was enjoying that, too.
[12723.58s -> 12741.48s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12794.09s -> 12794.57s]  Let's go.
[12801.71s -> 12804.11s]  Oh, this is the first mission of the game.
[12804.59s -> 12805.31s]  No, it's the first...
[12806.68s -> 12807.16s]  Slow down.
[12807.16s -> 12807.64s]  It's okay.
[12814.60s -> 12815.08s]  Shit.
[12815.64s -> 12816.76s]  All right.
[12816.76s -> 12817.72s]  I'm going to do it quick.
[12817.72s -> 12818.36s]  God damn it.
[12818.36s -> 12819.48s]  And a bunch of people left, too,
[12819.48s -> 12820.84s]  because they thought it was over.
[12820.84s -> 12821.80s]  So did I.
[12821.80s -> 12822.76s]  Oh, come on.
[12823.40s -> 12824.97s]  Quick.
[12824.97s -> 12826.73s]  Do everything I did really fast.
[12826.73s -> 12835.02s]  Speedrun.
[12835.66s -> 12837.18s]  Actually, legit speedrun.
[12837.18s -> 12838.14s]  I ain't fucking around.
[12838.14s -> 12839.74s]  We're getting there in five minutes.
[12839.74s -> 12840.38s]  Watch this shit.
[12852.04s -> 12852.52s]  I'm so...
[12854.52s -> 12855.56s]  I'm so flustered.
[12856.68s -> 12871.50s]  There's a shortcut.
[12871.50s -> 12872.38s]  I just missed it again.
[12889.18s -> 12890.54s]  Spilled my squishy.
[12892.91s -> 12894.43s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[12894.43s -> 12894.67s]  Quick.
[12894.67s -> 12894.99s]  Come on.
[12907.00s -> 12907.48s]  That was it.
[12907.48s -> 12909.16s]  That was a bunch of anger and rage
[12909.16s -> 12910.04s]  building up in my stomach.
[12910.92s -> 12931.77s]  Hit select to boost.
[12931.77s -> 12932.57s]  Oh, I know.
[12932.57s -> 12933.53s]  I don't care.
[12933.53s -> 12934.09s]  I don't care.
[12938.00s -> 12939.52s]  No hot tabs.
[12939.52s -> 12941.44s]  No, like, fucking choked dick.
[12941.44s -> 12942.88s]  No, I'm not doing it.
[12942.88s -> 12944.56s]  We're playing Simpsons.
[12944.56s -> 12945.68s]  Smash the like button.
[12951.36s -> 12962.52s]  Ah, fuck off.
[12966.73s -> 12975.80s]  Did you guys not hear...
[12975.80s -> 12976.84s]  Did you guys not hear the car?
[12977.64s -> 12981.61s]  That was...
[12981.61s -> 12983.21s]  That was beefing at the car.
[12983.21s -> 12984.09s]  Did you guys didn't hear that?
[12988.68s -> 12989.18s]  Ooh.
[12989.80s -> 12994.76s]  Did you guys didn't hear the car?
[13004.00s -> 13004.56s]  All right.
[13004.56s -> 13005.12s]  Bingo.
[13005.12s -> 13005.76s]  First try.
[13005.76s -> 13006.64s]  Don't fuck it up.
[13006.64s -> 13007.14s]  Go.
[13007.76s -> 13013.39s]  You ain't ever seen anybody go fucking as fast
[13013.39s -> 13014.51s]  as you're going to see me go right now.
[13015.23s -> 13029.74s]  What?
[13029.74s -> 13031.74s]  Oh my god.
[13031.74s -> 13032.54s]  I don't know what happened there.
[13032.54s -> 13033.26s]  Why did that happen?
[13033.98s -> 13055.18s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[13055.18s -> 13063.23s]  Which town in America though?
[13063.23s -> 13063.55s]  Which one?
[13065.15s -> 13065.55s]  Tell us.
[13066.88s -> 13068.24s]  We want to know as loyal viewers.
[13068.24s -> 13068.72s]  Which one?
[13069.44s -> 13070.80s]  What town is it?
[13070.80s -> 13084.16s]  Just go over the...
[13084.16s -> 13084.96s]  Just do it normal.
[13084.96s -> 13085.46s]  Normal.
[13086.40s -> 13087.04s]  I'm normal.
[13089.84s -> 13090.80s]  I'm normal.
[13090.80s -> 13091.20s]  Okay.
[13091.20s -> 13092.40s]  Get out of the way.
[13093.36s -> 13128.03s]  Welcome back, everybody.
[13128.59s -> 13132.49s]  Sorry that like 500 of you left.
[13133.05s -> 13137.90s]  As I press the alt tab button to put a fucking cape on my body.
[13138.86s -> 13140.94s]  Maybe if I just wasn't sitting here without clothes on,
[13140.94s -> 13142.70s]  I could just press the camera turn on button.
[13143.34s -> 13156.88s]  What's up there?
[13167.88s -> 13168.20s]  Yeah.
[13168.20s -> 13169.16s]  I was so just...
[13169.16s -> 13170.20s]  I was so sad.
[13171.07s -> 13172.75s]  I was angry but sad.
[13172.75s -> 13173.47s]  Sad angry.
[13173.47s -> 13174.75s]  Not even like upset angry.
[13174.75s -> 13176.67s]  Because I'm like I want to play this game.
[13176.67s -> 13178.75s]  And I almost just almost lost it.
[13178.75s -> 13182.00s]  Forever.
[13182.00s -> 13182.96s]  Show dick.
[13182.96s -> 13185.93s]  Don't make me turn this camera on.
[13185.93s -> 13195.44s]  What's in here?
[13202.19s -> 13212.06s]  Where am I?
[13212.06s -> 13219.95s]  Coin.
[13219.95s -> 13220.99s]  It worked.
[13220.99s -> 13223.37s]  Oh wait.
[13223.37s -> 13224.49s]  Is there a new clothes?
[13228.08s -> 13228.64s]  Normal.
[13228.64s -> 13229.28s]  Because I am.
[13231.82s -> 13239.37s]  What are you doing out there?
[13241.26s -> 13242.14s]  Not millhouse.
[13242.14s -> 13242.78s]  Grill house?
[13244.11s -> 13244.59s]  Bill house.
[13244.59s -> 13245.39s]  What's that guy's name?
[13246.11s -> 13246.83s]  Ralph.
[13246.83s -> 13270.94s]  He's not out here.
[13270.94s -> 13271.58s]  Pump it.
[13271.58s -> 13272.25s]  Wait.
[13272.25s -> 13272.65s]  What's that?
[13274.06s -> 13279.50s]  Just one of those one, two, three, four, five, six sided die.
[13280.54s -> 13281.42s]  Three sides.
[13282.06s -> 13286.88s]  I need to get this card again.
[13291.93s -> 13292.25s]  Fast.
[13292.25s -> 13292.89s]  I'm not gonna stop.
[13292.89s -> 13293.69s]  Just do it quick.
[13293.69s -> 13294.49s]  It's right here.
[13294.49s -> 13295.93s]  And then the gag is right there too.
[13296.65s -> 13297.69s]  Here we go.
[13297.69s -> 13298.09s]  Quickly.
[13298.09s -> 13309.08s]  He doesn't even need to see where he's going.
[13309.08s -> 13315.10s]  Officer Jackson's on the case.
[13315.10s -> 13316.14s]  All right.
[13316.14s -> 13317.10s]  We are now up to date.
[13337.58s -> 13339.21s]  Camp Krusty.
[13339.21s -> 13346.75s]  What are you doing here?
[13346.75s -> 13347.79s]  What's this?
[13347.79s -> 13351.63s]  Can we see the beer again?
[13351.63s -> 13357.02s]  I am never gonna alt tab for the rest of my life.
[13363.56s -> 13364.36s]  School bus.
[13364.36s -> 13365.16s]  Yeah, sure.
[13365.16s -> 13369.79s]  I don't know.
[13372.38s -> 13373.10s]  Distracting.
[13373.10s -> 13387.82s]  I don't like the lights in the back and I don't like the transparency on top.
[13388.86s -> 13389.42s]  Safe.
[13389.42s -> 13389.98s]  Okay.
[13389.98s -> 13396.76s]  I don't know.
[13396.76s -> 13397.40s]  True.
[13397.40s -> 13417.60s]  Talk to Poop.
[13417.60s -> 13420.09s]  Hey, Poop.
[13420.09s -> 13421.05s]  Come here.
[13421.05s -> 13423.05s]  Whoa, this is terrible.
[13423.05s -> 13428.03s]  A very bad man is delivering roadkill to all the Krusty Burgers, which are cheaper
[13428.03s -> 13428.99s]  than my quickie dough.
[13428.99s -> 13429.79s]  I'm not gonna save again.
[13429.79s -> 13430.27s]  Stop it.
[13430.27s -> 13436.12s]  To meet the meat eaters, hit and collect meat from Cletus's truck before time runs
[13436.12s -> 13436.52s]  out.
[13436.52s -> 13439.40s]  Nobody in my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving
[13439.40s -> 13440.12s]  around today.
[13440.12s -> 13441.40s]  One, two, three, four.
[13441.40s -> 13442.76s]  Let's just do this, babe.
[13442.76s -> 13443.48s]  Yes, sis.
[13443.48s -> 13453.85s]  Get off of me.
[13454.81s -> 13456.97s]  Giant crowbar just ruined everything.
[13457.77s -> 13468.84s]  Here's the meat.
[13469.85s -> 13470.73s]  Where's the meat?
[13491.53s -> 13492.97s]  I just got so baited again.
[13494.54s -> 13494.86s]  Yuck.
[13495.58s -> 13495.98s]  Yucky.
[13499.47s -> 13502.73s]  Does that count for me?
[13502.73s -> 13503.23s]  It doesn't.
[13508.09s -> 13509.53s]  No, this car's not gonna explode, right?
[13513.02s -> 13513.90s]  I need speed.
[13513.90s -> 13514.94s]  More speed.
[13514.94s -> 13520.40s]  I am a lean, mean, Vindaloo machine.
[13520.40s -> 13520.88s]  Come on.
[13522.00s -> 13522.64s]  Come on.
[13522.64s -> 13525.44s]  Perhaps I should refrain from doing that in the future.
[13525.44s -> 13525.92s]  Come on.
[13528.28s -> 13530.20s]  Come on, Gwen.
[13533.56s -> 13536.52s]  Come on, Gwen.
[13557.63s -> 13559.47s]  Oh, we gotta go.
[13559.47s -> 13562.11s]  Perhaps I should consult Professor Brink at the observatory.
[13562.11s -> 13563.47s]  He seems to know everything.
[13564.11s -> 13568.11s]  Except why I ever came to this jerkwater burglary.
[13568.11s -> 13571.47s]  I just drove on the wrong side of the road.
[13571.47s -> 13572.27s]  That wasn't even my fault.
[13573.31s -> 13586.89s]  Move your clumsy vehicle.
[13589.24s -> 13589.88s]  Cut me off.
[13590.84s -> 13601.18s]  Wait, I probably could have driven up, but it's okay.
[13602.62s -> 13603.18s]  What just happened?
[13605.72s -> 13607.32s]  That was a I died sound.
[13613.56s -> 13616.06s]  Action.
[13616.06s -> 13616.94s]  Professor Brink.
[13616.94s -> 13623.23s]  Let's see now.
[13623.23s -> 13627.82s]  We build a monster and then disappeared in a bright light.
[13627.82s -> 13629.58s]  Wow, this is crazy.
[13629.58s -> 13632.06s]  I need someone to talk to who's wise and learned.
[13632.78s -> 13633.90s]  Karma sounds sad.
[13633.90s -> 13635.02s]  I am the lizard queen.
[13635.02s -> 13635.66s]  I'm alright now.
[13641.16s -> 13642.52s]  I was very sad earlier.
[13643.24s -> 13651.23s]  I like the saxophone.
[13653.96s -> 13654.76s]  That's pretty cute.
[13655.48s -> 13658.67s]  This is so cute.
[13658.67s -> 13660.83s]  Grandpa, can you help me find Bart?
[13660.83s -> 13662.09s]  He's missing.
[13662.09s -> 13664.25s]  Maybe I'm just a senile old man,
[13664.25s -> 13667.05s]  but Bart's lucky red hat fell out of that black car.
[13667.05s -> 13668.09s]  Wow, Grandpa.
[13668.09s -> 13668.81s]  What a great call.
[13668.81s -> 13673.34s]  You showed why senior citizens are valuable members of the community.
[13673.34s -> 13675.82s]  I think my baby teeth are growing back.
[13675.82s -> 13677.98s]  That's why I had to punch that nurse.
[13677.98s -> 13681.74s]  I better use something big if I want to take that car out.
[13682.38s -> 13683.58s]  Like that school bus.
[13685.60s -> 13688.00s]  Destroy the black sedans to find a clue.
[13688.00s -> 13689.12s]  Don't let time run out.
[13689.12s -> 13690.88s]  Lisa Simpson at your service.
[13696.40s -> 13697.20s]  Can't jump off that.
[13701.10s -> 13701.82s]  Nope.
[13701.82s -> 13704.04s]  I do get the school bus though.
[13706.25s -> 13708.17s]  Maybe a soy pop would perk me up.
[13708.17s -> 13708.89s]  Go, go.
[13729.02s -> 13730.30s]  Speed, more speed.
[13731.26s -> 13740.00s]  Dude.
[13740.70s -> 13741.98s]  Dude, get out of my way.
[13742.78s -> 13746.44s]  Oh, I gotta go.
[13746.44s -> 13748.41s]  I gotta get outta here.
[13748.41s -> 13759.76s]  Why is everybody spamming I gotta go?
[13767.26s -> 13768.38s]  Why are you still alive?
[13769.34s -> 13772.97s]  Oh, Lisa said it.
[13772.97s -> 13779.37s]  What do I think of the movie Pixels?
[13783.84s -> 13785.04s]  I didn't see the movie Pixels.
[13785.04s -> 13786.24s]  It's probably the Adam Sandler movie.
[13786.80s -> 13789.71s]  I didn't see it.
[13790.68s -> 13792.68s]  I don't have an opinion on that movie.
[13792.68s -> 13794.36s]  Why would I see that movie?
[13794.36s -> 13807.93s]  Pac-Man is in that movie.
[13807.93s -> 13809.53s]  Yeah, so is Adam Sandler.
[13810.09s -> 13824.89s]  Is that Homer?
[13824.89s -> 13826.09s]  But so is Pac-Man.
[13827.37s -> 13829.37s]  But so is Adam Sandler.
[13829.93s -> 13846.75s]  Adam Sandler's not that bad.
[13847.63s -> 13851.60s]  You know, he's just a dope.
[13879.13s -> 13881.29s]  428, 428, 428.
[13882.09s -> 13884.25s]  Oh no, he went over that number right there.
[13884.25s -> 13884.81s]  That's funny.
[13885.61s -> 13904.06s]  Adam Sandler is not Nicolas Cage.
[13904.62s -> 13906.72s]  What, you think they're the same person?
[13907.36s -> 13911.85s]  All right, I only have 25 seconds.
[13924.83s -> 13934.08s]  Can you, why can you drive to the casino?
[13934.72s -> 13936.40s]  But there's a race over here.
[13939.12s -> 13940.64s]  One of them talks like this.
[13941.90s -> 13942.62s]  You know what I'm saying?
[13943.95s -> 13947.39s]  Nicolas Cage talks like this, unfortunately.
[13947.39s -> 13948.51s]  No, I'm doing, I'm doing.
[13948.51s -> 13949.23s]  Nick, what's his name?
[13949.23s -> 13952.19s]  Nick Offerman, the guy from Parks and Rec.
[13954.00s -> 13957.84s]  Now let me tell you, as a man, as an American, I...
[13964.16s -> 13965.28s]  This is a surprise.
[13970.04s -> 13970.92s]  Yeah, Ron Smonson.
[13970.92s -> 13972.36s]  That's like Nick Stevenson.
[13972.36s -> 13973.32s]  Nick Offerman?
[13973.32s -> 13973.80s]  What's his name?
[13976.76s -> 13990.03s]  This dip is that his name is not Ron Swanson in real life.
[13991.23s -> 13993.47s]  Why, I'm not getting a ha-ha right now.
[13994.43s -> 13995.47s]  Don't even think about it.
[13996.35s -> 13997.71s]  I'm very fragile right now.
[13998.59s -> 14000.27s]  I almost just all tabbed out of the whole world.
[14013.84s -> 14014.96s]  It's not ha-ha for you.
[14014.96s -> 14016.80s]  It's ha-ha for Nelson.
[14019.58s -> 14019.90s]  Why?
[14019.90s -> 14023.23s]  I'm here with the school bus for some reason.
[14023.23s -> 14024.35s]  I already did this one.
[14025.15s -> 14027.16s]  I already did this one.
[14039.23s -> 14040.59s]  I did this before the alt tab.
[14058.30s -> 14059.18s]  Why did I just...
[14059.90s -> 14062.09s]  What happened?
[14063.45s -> 14066.41s]  That was really weird.
[14067.21s -> 14071.40s]  What do I think of rocks?
[14071.40s -> 14073.00s]  Or what does Ron Swanson think of rocks?
[14074.59s -> 14078.51s]  Well, I do kind of like rocks a little.
[14104.25s -> 14105.69s]  I'm just doing Jora Mormond?
[14122.03s -> 14124.51s]  All right, I fucking restart the stupid race.
[14142.99s -> 14143.79s]  I already beat this.
[14143.79s -> 14144.51s]  It's not even fair.
[14145.47s -> 14148.67s]  I already won.
[14149.95s -> 14152.83s]  This guy is doing this on purpose.
[14152.83s -> 14154.75s]  What are you all doing?
[14154.75s -> 14156.51s]  What are you doing?
[14156.51s -> 14158.19s]  Why would you do what you just did?
[14159.15s -> 14160.99s]  What are you doing?
[14164.49s -> 14165.53s]  What are you doing?
[14166.73s -> 14168.81s]  This person's not supposed to be in first place.
[14169.53s -> 14172.52s]  Ever.
[14173.08s -> 14174.76s]  This is not happening.
[14175.32s -> 14180.14s]  He's just radically driving around like crazy.
[14180.14s -> 14181.42s]  Like a phrased person.
[14182.14s -> 14183.60s]  I'm so mad.
[14187.34s -> 14191.71s]  I gotta catch up.
[14192.43s -> 14208.46s]  That was pretty good too, but you can't even control it.
[14209.26s -> 14219.21s]  Yeah, I know.
[14219.21s -> 14221.69s]  I understand that I am losing to the sedan AI.
[14221.69s -> 14223.93s]  I know, but like something really weird happened.
[14234.64s -> 14247.20s]  Can we not have like a freak out moment
[14247.20s -> 14249.60s]  where everybody just drives into each other and drives into me?
[14250.96s -> 14252.72s]  Like this person is still doing it.
[14254.94s -> 14256.46s]  Fucking sedan AI.
[14256.46s -> 14257.26s]  Get out of the way.
[14258.30s -> 14281.82s]  I'm in first place, Lisa.
[14284.67s -> 14285.95s]  You're supposed to be the smart one.
[14305.04s -> 14306.00s]  There's so many more laps.
[14306.00s -> 14307.12s]  This is 40 laps.
[14308.48s -> 14309.84s]  45 more laps.
[14310.72s -> 14312.30s]  What am I going to do with all that?
[14314.32s -> 14326.62s]  I'm fine.
[14331.08s -> 14344.59s]  I'm about to lap you.
[14345.23s -> 14347.36s]  I gotta lap this guy.
[14347.36s -> 14348.32s]  No, I'm not going to lap him.
[14348.88s -> 14355.55s]  I'm speechless, Lisa.
[14355.55s -> 14357.87s]  That was better than you have any right to do.
[14362.51s -> 14362.99s]  BM.
[14363.63s -> 14367.98s]  Yeah, that was BM right there.
[14367.98s -> 14369.82s]  But you can't BM sedan AI.
[14370.54s -> 14379.18s]  It's the fastest thing I got right now.
[14379.18s -> 14395.10s]  Could you come get me?
[14395.10s -> 14395.90s]  Mr. Plow?
[14395.90s -> 14399.71s]  No, I like the sports car.
[14400.43s -> 14407.24s]  Finish all the races.
[14407.24s -> 14408.60s]  Yeah, I gotta come across them though.
[14408.60s -> 14409.80s]  It's hard for me to remember where they are.
[14410.52s -> 14429.42s]  Thank you.
[14429.42s -> 14430.36s]  All right.
[14430.44s -> 14431.72s]  Here's this mission here.
[14431.72s -> 14432.12s]  Wait.
[14432.12s -> 14432.92s]  I'll go too fast.
[14438.48s -> 14439.12s]  All right, Chief.
[14446.88s -> 14447.68s]  What is going on?
[14465.56s -> 14467.88s]  Be getting paid in potato chip coupons.
[14467.88s -> 14469.80s]  So what disguise do you have?
[14469.80s -> 14472.36s]  Well, here's one of Ralph's old Halloween costumes.
[14472.36s -> 14472.84s]  Fine.
[14472.84s -> 14474.44s]  Wait here and I'll get changed.
[14475.48s -> 14479.00s]  Let's meet in the middle.
[14479.00s -> 14480.60s]  Show a singular toe.
[14485.88s -> 14489.95s]  Need to disguise, purchase Lisa's cool clothes.
[14492.00s -> 14493.20s]  The house is not a disguise.
[14494.91s -> 14495.71s]  It's not a disguise.
[14517.68s -> 14519.20s]  I hate seeing the Florida.
[14519.20s -> 14519.92s]  Thank God.
[14521.47s -> 14522.75s]  All right, where do I buy a shirt?
[14528.44s -> 14529.64s]  Somewhere over here?
[14529.64s -> 14531.60s]  Can I phone in a t-shirt?
[14532.24s -> 14539.16s]  Where's t-shirt?
[14539.72s -> 14542.14s]  They just told me where to go.
[14542.14s -> 14545.82s]  But it didn't put them thing on my mini map because I'm stupid.
[14546.62s -> 14557.42s]  Oh, it's not the gas station.
[14557.98s -> 14565.58s]  What's over here?
[14566.62s -> 14566.86s]  Nice.
[14568.14s -> 14572.16s]  I don't have no idea what we're doing.
[14575.50s -> 14575.82s]  Wait.
[14576.38s -> 14576.86s]  Yeah, I do.
[14577.66s -> 14587.85s]  Never mind.
[14588.41s -> 14591.61s]  I thought there was something up there.
[14595.72s -> 14600.84s]  Comic book store, comic book store, comic shop, comic shop, comic, comic, comic, comic, comic, comic, comic.
[14603.64s -> 14611.53s]  Comic book, comic book, comic book, comic books.
[14614.83s -> 14616.99s]  No, that says coffee books.
[14616.99s -> 14618.43s]  No, that says cafe books.
[14618.43s -> 14619.55s]  I thought it said comic books.
[14625.76s -> 14626.24s]  What is this?
[14639.82s -> 14642.38s]  Arcade, books, cafe.
[14662.59s -> 14662.99s]  Whatever.
[14665.90s -> 14666.62s]  I know what's right there.
[14666.62s -> 14667.10s]  I was trying to get it.
[14667.10s -> 14667.90s]  There's a card on top.
[14671.44s -> 14672.88s]  Lisa, cool.
[14672.88s -> 14673.68s]  I'm running out of money.
[14674.40s -> 14689.04s]  Return to the casino.
[14700.75s -> 14701.79s]  What sucks?
[14701.79s -> 14702.99s]  Stream sucks?
[14702.99s -> 14706.17s]  Did you just say?
[14706.17s -> 14708.14s]  Did you just say the stream sucks?
[14713.71s -> 14716.62s]  Oh, all right.
[14717.34s -> 14720.30s]  You know, we have to have a 1v1
[14721.10s -> 14722.22s]  Cod Wager match.
[14722.22s -> 14723.10s]  Now that you said that.
[14732.08s -> 14734.88s]  Follow Snake and find three strikes of evidence against him.
[14734.88s -> 14735.84s]  Don't miss any items.
[14747.32s -> 14747.72s]  Jeans.
[14754.43s -> 14755.71s]  That guy just ran somebody over.
[14756.51s -> 14758.67s]  For a second, did he just drop a lamp?
[14759.55s -> 14760.59s]  No, he ran that over.
[14765.31s -> 14766.30s]  What'd he drop?
[14767.10s -> 14767.58s]  A person.
[14768.38s -> 14770.70s]  An elderly person without a license.
[14770.70s -> 14772.22s]  That's a moving violation.
[14788.11s -> 14788.91s]  All right.
[14788.91s -> 14789.79s]  Don't give me shit.
[14789.79s -> 14790.67s]  That's bullshit.
[14791.31s -> 14793.15s]  The game decided that it was.
[14805.04s -> 14806.48s]  If I was in a competition right there,
[14806.48s -> 14809.34s]  I would have just been very mad.
[14810.70s -> 14811.90s]  That's not a wager right there.
[14819.42s -> 14822.52s]  You're just lucky I can't remember faces.
[14823.56s -> 14827.69s]  Score one for Wiggum.
[14827.69s -> 14829.13s]  Sorry, sorry.
[14829.13s -> 14830.81s]  Extreme to the max.
[14830.81s -> 14831.93s]  Strike two.
[14831.93s -> 14835.13s]  Running over an elderly person without a license.
[14835.13s -> 14837.29s]  That's showing him what for.
[14837.29s -> 14839.69s]  He really wants to go on that bridge, doesn't he?
[14839.69s -> 14840.65s]  I need speed.
[14840.65s -> 14841.45s]  More speed.
[14842.81s -> 14844.01s]  I can't do that.
[14844.81s -> 14846.65s]  How am I supposed to do what you just did?
[14847.29s -> 14850.68s]  You just magnetized over all those rocks.
[14872.70s -> 14874.54s]  Legally sanctioned violence.
[14874.54s -> 14875.80s]  Strike.
[14875.80s -> 14877.64s]  Counterfeit designer jeans.
[14877.64s -> 14880.03s]  The foulest of all things.
[14880.03s -> 14880.99s]  I need speed.
[14880.99s -> 14881.71s]  More speed.
[14889.15s -> 14890.11s]  Cursed streamer.
[14891.15s -> 14896.22s]  You want a cursed streamer?
[14896.22s -> 14898.40s]  I hope you're recyclable.
[14898.40s -> 14899.20s]  Smashing.
[14899.20s -> 14900.32s]  Strike two.
[14900.32s -> 14903.04s]  Running over an elderly person without a license.
[14903.04s -> 14903.28s]  No.
[14903.28s -> 14904.24s]  I'm going to hold on to that one.
[14904.24s -> 14904.96s]  That's not funny.
[14906.00s -> 14912.73s]  I was getting close.
[14914.22s -> 14914.70s]  There it is.
[14916.86s -> 14917.82s]  Okay, thank God.
[14918.70s -> 14921.87s]  I was going to do a whole thing where I put a curse on everybody.
[14922.51s -> 14923.96s]  As a witch.
[14924.92s -> 14928.28s]  But I could feel the eyeballs on that.
[14929.32s -> 14930.68s]  Get out of my fucking way.
[14931.48s -> 14937.18s]  And I missed the shortcut.
[14937.90s -> 14945.40s]  It's going to be close because I missed the easiest shortcut in the video game.
[14946.84s -> 14953.10s]  Sorry, I got 20 seconds.
[14964.22s -> 14969.90s]  And strike three.
[14969.90s -> 14970.46s]  Literate.
[14970.46s -> 14970.96s]  Got it.
[14972.04s -> 14974.28s]  We got all we need on this lowlife.
[14974.28s -> 14975.96s]  Now, about your brother.
[14976.04s -> 14979.72s]  I've seen lots of mysterious government types over at the docks.
[14979.72s -> 14981.64s]  Uh, maybe they send him on a nice cruise.
[14981.64s -> 14983.96s]  They got some great package deals these days.
[14983.96s -> 14985.56s]  Five buffets per boat.
[14985.56s -> 14986.12s]  I want...
[14986.12s -> 14987.24s]  Oh, a buffet.
[14989.08s -> 14991.32s]  Sometimes I fucking forget where I live.
[14994.59s -> 14995.39s]  Ooh.
[14995.39s -> 14996.19s]  That sounds...
[14996.19s -> 14997.15s]  That sounds great.
[15011.50s -> 15015.55s]  Did I just do a handstand?
[15018.94s -> 15028.14s]  Oh, I could go for...
[15028.14s -> 15032.14s]  I could go for just some dog shit buffet chicken nuggets.
[15036.51s -> 15038.11s]  You know, when you go over to the chicken nugget buffet,
[15038.75s -> 15041.47s]  there's like 400 chicken nuggets there and you just load it up.
[15041.47s -> 15042.91s]  You just keep putting them on the plate.
[15043.87s -> 15044.91s]  You don't even give a shit.
[15067.44s -> 15069.76s]  And sometimes there's just a random vegetable there.
[15071.84s -> 15073.12s]  You load up on asparagus.
[15075.60s -> 15076.48s]  Who's this person?
[15076.48s -> 15077.52s]  Who's this random dude?
[15081.10s -> 15082.46s]  Who is that random seahorse?
[15085.18s -> 15085.90s]  What are you doing?
[15086.62s -> 15088.86s]  Get out of here.
[15089.58s -> 15093.90s]  I'm trying to get in the car.
[15094.54s -> 15104.81s]  No, I gotta take a...
[15104.81s -> 15105.85s]  I gotta take out a fish.
[15106.65s -> 15109.50s]  Okay.
[15139.26s -> 15140.06s]  You missed seven.
[15141.26s -> 15141.76s]  No, I didn't.
[15163.02s -> 15163.52s]  How?
[15165.98s -> 15190.16s]  I got it and it didn't even do anything for me.
[15204.16s -> 15204.66s]  Ooh.
[15206.16s -> 15206.66s]  Buffet.
[15207.68s -> 15209.45s]  They have like fish sticks there.
[15210.17s -> 15218.54s]  Sometimes they got some fish there.
[15227.29s -> 15229.53s]  That turned way faster than I thought it was.
[15230.41s -> 15233.56s]  Fish sticks at a buffet?
[15233.56s -> 15234.12s]  Sometimes, yeah.
[15234.12s -> 15235.40s]  They got like fried cod.
[15236.20s -> 15250.78s]  Not necessarily fish sticks, but fried fish sticks.
[15252.70s -> 15253.58s]  I know what that is.
[15254.22s -> 15269.56s]  I don't get it.
[15270.20s -> 15276.56s]  Why did I even turn...
[15276.56s -> 15278.72s]  I look at chat and I see somebody says,
[15278.72s -> 15280.48s]  Jerma, you seem off today.
[15280.48s -> 15293.28s]  You seem off today.
[15293.28s -> 15294.56s]  No, I'm just having fun, man.
[15304.04s -> 15304.68s]  Did I...
[15304.68s -> 15305.32s]  I already got that.
[15305.32s -> 15320.08s]  Yeah, I got that interaction, right?
[15320.08s -> 15322.64s]  Chat seems more off than Jerma does.
[15330.49s -> 15331.69s]  Yeah, what's going on?
[15331.69s -> 15332.97s]  What's wrong with you guys right now?
[15332.97s -> 15333.69s]  What happened?
[15333.69s -> 15334.49s]  What's going on here?
[15335.13s -> 15356.41s]  I guess I have to go down there.
[15356.97s -> 15361.32s]  I'm here watching the world's worst gamer.
[15362.81s -> 15363.69s]  I don't think that's true.
[15364.33s -> 15373.08s]  I think you're just saying that.
[15373.08s -> 15373.88s]  I don't think that's true.
[15373.88s -> 15374.76s]  Watch this, buddy.
[15385.60s -> 15386.64s]  This kid's still here.
[15391.98s -> 15393.90s]  Thanks for delivering me catch of the day.
[15394.46s -> 15398.30s]  Now, I can tell you, I saw your brother.
[15398.30s -> 15399.10s]  Really?
[15399.10s -> 15400.44s]  That's great.
[15400.44s -> 15402.28s]  He was in the long black limo.
[15402.28s -> 15404.60s]  And ahoy, there she drove.
[15406.16s -> 15408.08s]  Took me hours to finish this when I was young.
[15410.41s -> 15412.17s]  Get her to the black limo to find Bart.
[15412.17s -> 15421.16s]  Let's just do this thing for speed.
[15421.16s -> 15423.32s]  Uh, doesn't seem like the right car for this.
[15424.36s -> 15431.00s]  Into the water?
[15435.82s -> 15442.24s]  How did you just turn that around on me?
[15449.16s -> 15450.04s]  Into the water.
[15450.04s -> 15450.92s]  Get into the water.
[15453.00s -> 15454.44s]  I'm losing this fight.
[15458.97s -> 15460.09s]  What kind of limo is this?
[15467.32s -> 15468.76s]  Strongest damn limo I've ever seen.
[15476.40s -> 15477.20s]  Drop in frames.
[15479.37s -> 15480.09s]  Ah, crap.
[15481.05s -> 15481.45s]  It's alright.
[15486.11s -> 15486.59s]  It'll pass.
[15489.84s -> 15490.48s]  Usually does.
[15502.97s -> 15506.57s]  My car is gonna blow up before this does.
[15506.57s -> 15508.57s]  Give me that wrench.
[15508.57s -> 15509.61s]  I'm only halfway there.
[15510.41s -> 15511.52s]  How am I gonna do this?
[15511.52s -> 15514.32s]  I need another car for this.
[15515.20s -> 15519.34s]  I thought that was full speed.
[15520.22s -> 15523.32s]  Gonna push you into a wall or something.
[15524.12s -> 15531.61s]  Drive him into the wall.
[15531.61s -> 15532.17s]  Into the wall.
[15532.73s -> 15533.37s]  Into the wall.
[15546.65s -> 15552.46s]  Ah, let's just do it again.
[15560.44s -> 15562.16s]  If I see a phone, I'm getting out.
[15572.16s -> 15572.64s]  There we go.
[15574.80s -> 15576.16s]  How are you on top of my car?
[15579.79s -> 15580.67s]  Yeah, I'll be alright though.
[15580.67s -> 15581.63s]  I'm good, I'm good.
[15581.63s -> 15582.43s]  I don't need a phone.
[15583.15s -> 15588.17s]  You just have to drive him into the wall.
[15588.73s -> 15589.92s]  Like this.
[15589.92s -> 15590.80s]  I have to stay behind him.
[15591.52s -> 15594.17s]  There we go.
[15594.17s -> 15597.04s]  Just keep the momentum behind him
[15597.04s -> 15598.32s]  and he will drive into walls.
[15604.30s -> 15605.02s]  See?
[15605.02s -> 15606.91s]  At least that's what I'm talking about.
[15607.87s -> 15612.49s]  One more.
[15614.01s -> 15616.12s]  Right into the wall.
[15621.15s -> 15621.63s]  Into the wall.
[15626.01s -> 15626.49s]  Come on.
[15627.45s -> 15630.44s]  Right there, bang.
[15631.32s -> 15632.12s]  That's not enough.
[15643.15s -> 15644.11s]  Drive into something.
[15645.29s -> 15654.01s]  Drive into something.
[15654.01s -> 15655.13s]  I'm being towed.
[15655.85s -> 15656.35s]  Ah!
[15657.05s -> 15676.68s]  You have no idea how hard that was to keep that up.
[15692.68s -> 15693.80s]  Alright, let's see.
[15693.80s -> 15694.28s]  Captain?
[15695.16s -> 15697.29s]  Went down the wrong tube.
[15697.29s -> 15697.85s]  Sorry.
[15701.47s -> 15701.87s]  Punch it.
[15702.43s -> 15713.24s]  He ate his pant?
[15714.52s -> 15715.16s]  Ate pant.
[15720.44s -> 15721.64s]  Alright, what's next?
[15766.81s -> 15768.01s]  It's timed!
[15769.13s -> 15769.45s]  No!
[15770.09s -> 15770.41s]  What?
[15770.97s -> 15772.81s]  Oh my god, what am I doing?
[15773.53s -> 15774.49s]  I was just...
[15774.49s -> 15775.29s]  Okay, I'm good.
[15775.29s -> 15775.77s]  What happened?
[15775.77s -> 15776.41s]  Did I get barred?
[15776.41s -> 15777.29s]  Did I find barred?
[15778.01s -> 15778.57s]  I found him.
[15789.26s -> 15789.74s]  Shit.
[15790.46s -> 15792.54s]  Alright, I found barred.
[15792.54s -> 15792.94s]  That's fine.
[15795.26s -> 15795.50s]  What?
[15796.22s -> 15802.08s]  What's going...
[15802.08s -> 15802.72s]  Where's barred?
[15803.44s -> 15807.56s]  Where does this want me to go?
[15807.56s -> 15808.20s]  In the boat?
[15809.00s -> 15828.00s]  The arrow stops here.
[15828.00s -> 15829.28s]  I gotta go to the other side.
[15830.08s -> 15831.71s]  Can I make this jump?
[15832.27s -> 15840.92s]  There's a ramp?
[15842.20s -> 15843.80s]  Did I miss the ramp on the other side?
[15861.87s -> 15862.59s]  Where is this thing?
[15863.23s -> 15882.97s]  There it is.
[15882.97s -> 15885.16s]  Bart!
[15885.16s -> 15885.56s]  Bart!
[15901.32s -> 15902.52s]  Oh no, this is not good.
[15903.40s -> 15907.40s]  Where was the ramp on the other side?
[15907.96s -> 15908.28s]  I just...
[15908.28s -> 15909.56s]  I drove around in a circle.
[15909.56s -> 15909.72s]  Did I...
[15909.72s -> 15911.00s]  I missed it when I was on the way up?
[15911.72s -> 15913.31s]  God damn it.
[15919.23s -> 15919.79s]  You know what?
[15919.79s -> 15920.27s]  Like this...
[15921.31s -> 15922.43s]  For the love of god.
[15930.78s -> 15945.42s]  I'm gonna do this in five seconds.
[15946.14s -> 15959.58s]  Or not.
[15959.58s -> 15963.37s]  You just have 500,000 health.
[15964.17s -> 15983.04s]  Right into the wall.
[15983.60s -> 15997.07s]  Rash.
[16012.33s -> 16016.11s]  They made this way too tough to kill this thing.
[16016.11s -> 16020.20s]  It just has too much health.
[16020.84s -> 16030.73s]  A child could do this?
[16030.73s -> 16031.61s]  No, no, no, no!
[16032.41s -> 16033.93s]  Remember the person in chat that said
[16033.93s -> 16035.69s]  this mission took them like seven hours?
[16038.83s -> 16039.63s]  No, this is not a...
[16042.16s -> 16043.28s]  Get out of the way.
[16044.08s -> 16051.26s]  No, and I'm looking at fucking chat.
[16054.14s -> 16055.18s]  Yeah, as a child...
[16055.18s -> 16057.42s]  Do you know how hard these old
[16057.42s -> 16060.94s]  fucking games from like the 2000-1998 era are?
[16063.36s -> 16064.48s]  They're so hard.
[16065.04s -> 16066.24s]  They're incredibly hard.
[16066.80s -> 16068.48s]  They're difficult video games.
[16069.28s -> 16074.04s]  Go load up Donkey Kong Country.
[16074.68s -> 16076.84s]  I guarantee you rage quit after the first world.
[16090.40s -> 16092.00s]  All right, so where's this jump?
[16092.72s -> 16098.65s]  If I follow the arrows here...
[16099.29s -> 16101.98s]  The arrows are pointing me to go this way.
[16101.98s -> 16102.22s]  Why...
[16102.94s -> 16103.66s]  Then they stop.
[16113.24s -> 16116.52s]  Why would the arrows tell me to go this way?
[16116.92s -> 16118.52s]  If I don't have to go this way.
[16125.60s -> 16126.24s]  That doesn't make...
[16126.24s -> 16127.52s]  Why are they on the ground there?
[16131.44s -> 16133.52s]  Was I actually in the right spot last time?
[16133.52s -> 16134.08s]  Like in here?
[16142.28s -> 16143.00s]  Just hold on.
[16143.00s -> 16143.96s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16143.96s -> 16145.16s]  Hold on a second.
[16145.16s -> 16147.48s]  So do not follow the arrows on the ground,
[16147.48s -> 16151.40s]  which for the entire, entire video game,
[16151.40s -> 16152.92s]  it points you in the right direction
[16152.92s -> 16153.88s]  to where you're supposed to drive.
[16167.32s -> 16168.36s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16168.36s -> 16169.08s]  Right there.
[16173.10s -> 16173.74s]  I just...
[16173.74s -> 16174.78s]  I don't see it.
[16176.64s -> 16177.52s]  I'm serious.
[16178.16s -> 16179.44s]  Like over here...
[16179.44s -> 16180.32s]  Where is this?
[16180.32s -> 16181.28s]  I know it's right there,
[16181.28s -> 16182.24s]  but how do I get in there?
[16190.57s -> 16192.25s]  Just drive this way.
[16192.97s -> 16194.65s]  Oh my fucking God.
[16194.65s -> 16196.81s]  Well, it's not even pointing me in the right direction.
[16197.69s -> 16201.44s]  The arrows didn't even remotely go this way.
[16209.66s -> 16210.30s]  I can do it.
[16216.03s -> 16217.23s]  Oh my fucking God.
[16217.23s -> 16217.73s]  No!
[16218.43s -> 16219.55s]  No, God!
[16219.55s -> 16220.51s]  I can do it in the jump!
[16222.54s -> 16222.94s]  Bart!
[16226.88s -> 16227.44s]  Where is he?
[16228.54s -> 16229.04s]  Bart!
[16229.93s -> 16230.43s]  Oh!
[16238.92s -> 16257.15s]  He didn't tell me to go...
[16257.15s -> 16257.65s]  Whatever.
[16278.72s -> 16279.60s]  They didn't...
[16279.60s -> 16281.28s]  I know I did that jump before,
[16281.28s -> 16283.04s]  but the arrows to get there weren't...
[16283.04s -> 16285.31s]  I thought I had to go a different way.
[16285.31s -> 16288.43s]  Why wouldn't the arrows point like to go over the ramp?
[16290.04s -> 16300.33s]  Oh, I get to be Marge now.
[16300.33s -> 16309.04s]  Wait, let me play with the TV.
[16324.30s -> 16325.18s]  What is wrong with Bart?
[16325.18s -> 16328.38s]  Bart, what's causing your ooga booga talk?
[16329.10s -> 16331.90s]  My special little guy's nougat has turned to goo goo.
[16332.54s -> 16334.60s]  The whole town's gone nuts.
[16335.16s -> 16339.48s]  Security cameras, mysterious vans, crop circles.
[16340.04s -> 16341.88s]  There's got to be a connection.
[16341.88s -> 16342.76s]  Yeah, something's wrong with his...
[16344.28s -> 16345.72s]  I think the game might be fucked up.
[16346.36s -> 16346.92s]  You hear him?
[16348.28s -> 16349.24s]  He's like blah blah blah.
[16349.24s -> 16350.52s]  I think the audio fucked up.
[16362.76s -> 16363.48s]  That's how...
[16363.48s -> 16364.76s]  Why is Marge running like this?
[16371.10s -> 16372.54s]  Easy come, easy go.
[16377.32s -> 16379.16s]  Marge Simpson, at your service.
[16383.44s -> 16383.94s]  Hold on!
[16392.24s -> 16394.01s]  Send the bill to...
[16394.01s -> 16395.85s]  So am I on the final family member?
[16397.85s -> 16400.09s]  Is this the last chapter of the game?
[16400.81s -> 16413.69s]  All right, I did it.
[16413.69s -> 16418.88s]  Now I gotta talk to you.
[16419.68s -> 16422.96s]  Chief Wiggum, I need you to find out what happened to Bart.
[16422.96s -> 16425.12s]  Could you show me where the crop circle is?
[16425.84s -> 16429.12s]  There's got to be a clue to curing Bart.
[16429.12s -> 16430.40s]  Ha, that's cute.
[16430.40s -> 16433.52s]  I'd love to help, but I got sugar withdrawal real bad.
[16433.52s -> 16438.08s]  The doughnut store is closed and I got a monkey on my back screaming for crawler.
[16438.08s -> 16440.27s]  Oh, he's screaming.
[16441.87s -> 16446.01s]  Oh god, hit the doughnut truck to get the doughnuts.
[16446.01s -> 16447.69s]  I need 10 doughnuts starting now.
[16448.73s -> 16454.49s]  We're gonna we got a first try missions here.
[16454.49s -> 16456.97s]  I can't do any more scream missions where I scream.
[16471.68s -> 16473.52s]  Hey, thanks for the doughnut.
[16496.76s -> 16498.56s]  Uh, it's not gonna happen.
[16499.12s -> 16499.84s]  About this late.
[16524.80s -> 16525.60s]  No, I'm not.
[16526.32s -> 16527.55s]  I'm not.
[16528.11s -> 16533.64s]  They give you plenty of time for this one.
[16533.64s -> 16535.74s]  I'm so glad.
[16535.74s -> 16537.58s]  Oh my god, I would be like, what the fuck?
[16537.58s -> 16537.98s]  You know what I mean?
[16537.98s -> 16538.94s]  I'd be like, what the fuck?
[16539.74s -> 16540.78s]  Let's get a stupid fuck.
[16548.54s -> 16552.84s]  Oh, how's that for a turn around?
[16552.84s -> 16573.82s]  No, I didn't want the camera to change.
[16574.70s -> 16577.07s]  I wanted to be able to see where I was going.
[16595.48s -> 16595.80s]  Man.
[16596.60s -> 16598.49s]  Oh man.
[16600.54s -> 16601.42s]  Oh man.
[16603.98s -> 16604.46s]  Oh, get...
[16607.02s -> 16608.46s]  Oh, all right.
[16609.18s -> 16611.82s]  My whole body just almost exploded.
[16625.05s -> 16626.97s]  I want a new costume for March.
[16632.24s -> 16636.00s]  I had one for Homer, had one for Lisa, had two for Lisa.
[16636.96s -> 16644.12s]  Let me take a look.
[16644.84s -> 16648.84s]  I need some money.
[16648.84s -> 16649.48s]  I need money.
[16650.44s -> 16652.20s]  I need like 300, 400, 500.
[16653.32s -> 16653.88s]  Something like that.
[16653.88s -> 16654.52s]  What is her attack?
[16657.56s -> 16659.64s]  You want to know what the best Simpsons video game ever made is?
[16663.77s -> 16664.89s]  And I kind of wish I could play it.
[16665.85s -> 16666.81s]  I wonder if there's a way to play it.
[16669.26s -> 16670.46s]  Remember the Simpsons arcade game?
[16673.61s -> 16675.13s]  That game was amazing.
[16678.16s -> 16678.80s]  The beat-em-up.
[16679.44s -> 16683.15s]  That was probably the best Simpsons video game ever.
[16686.33s -> 16688.73s]  How about that side?
[16688.73s -> 16689.45s]  Is there a card?
[16689.45s -> 16690.41s]  There's a card over there.
[16691.29s -> 16694.57s]  I wonder if I can make it from here.
[16697.05s -> 16697.53s]  Not really.
[16700.24s -> 16701.20s]  It's going to be a tough jump.
[16702.56s -> 16703.12s]  Didn't even...
[16703.12s -> 16703.52s]  Whatever.
[16703.52s -> 16703.92s]  Goodbye.
[16704.56s -> 16709.80s]  There's a version of the 360.
[16709.80s -> 16710.36s]  Is there really?
[16711.08s -> 16715.13s]  That's actually awesome.
[16715.77s -> 16717.05s]  All right.
[16717.05s -> 16721.13s]  Inmate March, Classy March, or Police March?
[16721.69s -> 16723.56s]  I only have 300 points.
[16724.68s -> 16735.76s]  I need 400 for Police March.
[16738.43s -> 16738.91s]  No, no.
[16739.55s -> 16740.94s]  I'll save it.
[16743.87s -> 16744.67s]  Speaking of saving it.
[16756.91s -> 16757.23s]  All right.
[16759.12s -> 16761.76s]  So I can just try collecting money.
[16771.90s -> 16772.86s]  Save Millhouse.
[16779.32s -> 16780.28s]  Save Millhouse.
[16780.28s -> 16781.32s]  Kill Millhouse.
[16781.32s -> 16783.32s]  Why would you want me to do something like that?
[16783.32s -> 16786.44s]  Millhouse is a great, great young lad.
[16787.24s -> 16807.36s]  There is a race available.
[16808.16s -> 16809.21s]  I didn't do the other ones.
[16809.21s -> 16810.97s]  But I need to do the three races.
[16810.97s -> 16811.45s]  I have to.
[16827.98s -> 16828.78s]  What is that car?
[16831.98s -> 16832.30s]  All right.
[16832.30s -> 16833.10s]  Do I get that?
[16833.50s -> 16834.62s]  For doing the three races.
[16835.50s -> 16836.70s]  How am I ever going to compete with this?
[16841.50s -> 16843.48s]  Oh.
[16843.48s -> 16844.60s]  That, apparently.
[16846.60s -> 16855.39s]  I was going too fast.
[16856.11s -> 16859.60s]  The SUV, you can't turn it very well.
[16859.60s -> 16862.44s]  If I do that again, I might be able to do it.
[16867.60s -> 16872.06s]  This is not the right car for this.
[16873.50s -> 16873.74s]  No.
[16880.36s -> 16881.18s]  Not going to happen.
[16887.45s -> 16893.37s]  Clown car.
[16893.93s -> 16899.15s]  There's a lot of cars, huh?
[16902.96s -> 16904.56s]  Sedan is probably the best one.
[16904.56s -> 16906.16s]  Or Lisa's car.
[16916.38s -> 16917.42s]  And Lisa's going to drive.
[16924.49s -> 16925.61s]  How do you get the clown car?
[16932.48s -> 16933.92s]  We were promised a clown car.
[16934.64s -> 16935.36s]  How do I unlock it?
[16940.22s -> 16941.02s]  You've got to buy it.
[16941.74s -> 16942.38s]  How much is it?
[16942.94s -> 16955.64s]  It's not nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.
[16956.60s -> 16960.51s]  He's still playing this?
[16960.51s -> 16961.01s]  Yeah.
[16961.63s -> 16963.07s]  I'm probably going to complete it tonight.
[16966.22s -> 16969.74s]  I can't start Simpsons hitting a run and not finish it.
[16981.40s -> 16983.32s]  He thinks he's going to do it.
[16987.84s -> 16988.64s]  Oh yeah, I'm going to do that.
[16988.64s -> 16989.28s]  I'm going to try this.
[16994.06s -> 16996.14s]  It's a minimum of 11 hours.
[16998.17s -> 17001.52s]  Well, is it?
[17002.56s -> 17015.42s]  Straight through.
[17015.42s -> 17016.62s]  I don't want to go too fast.
[17020.65s -> 17022.33s]  That's why, but I'm the first still.
[17023.53s -> 17024.81s]  All right, now stay in first.
[17025.69s -> 17027.29s]  Holy shit, this car is so fast.
[17034.35s -> 17037.32s]  How am I going to keep in front of you?
[17040.68s -> 17041.18s]  What?
[17041.48s -> 17041.98s]  Marge?
[17046.78s -> 17049.42s]  You went over that and it turned out it was a bad idea.
[17052.80s -> 17055.68s]  I got to hit every one of these like secret jumps.
[17063.63s -> 17066.76s]  I'm not ready for this one.
[17067.48s -> 17071.10s]  That car is too good.
[17071.74s -> 17074.03s]  I need the clown car before I come back.
[17080.25s -> 17081.13s]  Try it one more time.
[17089.10s -> 17091.10s]  I have to beat all these to get the clown car.
[17094.38s -> 17096.14s]  Rotten Fresh just gave $50.
[17096.14s -> 17097.26s]  Hey, Jerma, I just got a job.
[17097.26s -> 17098.38s]  Want to give back?
[17098.38s -> 17099.50s]  It's the people that meant the most.
[17100.14s -> 17100.86s]  So here I am.
[17100.86s -> 17102.78s]  Plus, I loved this game when I was a kid.
[17102.78s -> 17103.28s]  Enjoy.
[17103.74s -> 17105.98s]  Thank you so much, Rotten.
[17106.70s -> 17107.74s]  For your $50.
[17108.78s -> 17110.38s]  Your huge $50.
[17113.37s -> 17113.87s]  Thank you.
[17116.03s -> 17119.04s]  That means a lot.
[17123.47s -> 17124.27s]  $50 bucks.
[17134.84s -> 17135.34s]  Yeah.
[17135.64s -> 17138.44s]  Congratulations on the...
[17142.44s -> 17143.40s]  Is there a skip right here?
[17144.04s -> 17144.76s]  Is this a skip?
[17155.77s -> 17156.33s]  Nice skip.
[17160.88s -> 17167.77s]  I wish Marge would just sit down.
[17169.63s -> 17174.14s]  That doesn't really do anything for me.
[17174.14s -> 17175.42s]  I feel like I shouldn't even do that one.
[17185.20s -> 17186.64s]  You're just so much faster than me.
[17192.60s -> 17193.40s]  Ooh.
[17193.40s -> 17194.28s]  You screwed up, though.
[17195.24s -> 17203.87s]  He can go over that grass better than I can.
[17221.40s -> 17222.12s]  No.
[17222.12s -> 17222.68s]  I...
[17222.68s -> 17223.72s]  I think I need a better car.
[17224.60s -> 17227.16s]  I think I need to come in with a faster or better handling car.
[17227.16s -> 17229.16s]  There's always twists and turns and...
[17230.20s -> 17235.16s]  That car is just twice as fast as mine.
[17235.16s -> 17241.23s]  I'm gonna take more shortcuts.
[17241.23s -> 17242.91s]  Well, I have to memorize where the shortcuts are
[17242.91s -> 17244.03s]  and that is not gonna happen.
[17244.83s -> 17250.24s]  I can guarantee you that.
[17275.29s -> 17277.69s]  I never underachieve at anything.
[17277.69s -> 17279.69s]  Is this going to affect my insurance?
[17281.05s -> 17282.09s]  We both just about...
[17282.09s -> 17282.65s]  Holy shit.
[17282.65s -> 17284.01s]  He fucked it all up.
[17284.01s -> 17284.73s]  Come on.
[17284.73s -> 17285.29s]  Pay attention.
[17299.13s -> 17299.63s]  No!
[17301.16s -> 17302.28s]  He went over the thing.
[17302.28s -> 17302.68s]  Whatever.
[17302.68s -> 17303.56s]  The giant thing.
[17303.56s -> 17304.44s]  I don't know what it was.
[17304.44s -> 17305.72s]  He's doing every single...
[17305.72s -> 17307.32s]  You have to hit every single shortcut.
[17307.32s -> 17308.44s]  I just don't know where they are.
[17310.06s -> 17310.62s]  Ah.
[17310.62s -> 17311.82s]  God damn it.
[17311.82s -> 17313.66s]  You have to hit every single shortcut.
[17314.46s -> 17316.00s]  I had it.
[17316.00s -> 17317.20s]  I don't even know what I fucking hit there.
[17319.87s -> 17320.37s]  No.
[17322.59s -> 17324.43s]  He's taking all the shortcuts.
[17335.68s -> 17336.72s]  It's not even a race.
[17338.12s -> 17339.16s]  It's just cheating.
[17340.20s -> 17341.32s]  This is not a race.
[17341.32s -> 17342.76s]  This is who can cheat better.
[17343.40s -> 17345.56s]  Which one of you two can take the cheat codes better?
[17365.82s -> 17366.14s]  No.
[17366.14s -> 17366.94s]  I'm done.
[17366.94s -> 17369.66s]  No thanks.
[17371.80s -> 17372.52s]  No thanks.
[17372.52s -> 17372.92s]  No.
[17372.92s -> 17373.40s]  No thank you.
[17375.05s -> 17375.55s]  Nope.
[17380.57s -> 17381.07s]  Nope.
[17414.25s -> 17414.75s]  Nope.
[17419.96s -> 17420.46s]  Nope.
[17420.46s -> 17448.90s]  I know.
[17448.90s -> 17449.38s]  Hold on.
[17449.38s -> 17450.18s]  Just give me a second.
[17451.78s -> 17452.98s]  Wait till the cut scene's over.
[17464.08s -> 17464.88s]  I have to alt tab.
[17467.06s -> 17468.02s]  Save the goddamn game.
[17482.22s -> 17482.46s]  All right.
[17482.46s -> 17483.02s]  It's saved.
[17486.03s -> 17486.67s]  Okay.
[17486.67s -> 17489.22s]  Here we go.
[17489.22s -> 17493.44s]  I don't know why my streamlabs is minimized.
[17493.44s -> 17494.96s]  And I don't know why the hell that happened.
[17497.60s -> 17498.32s]  It's actually gone.
[17498.32s -> 17498.96s]  Why is it gone?
[17506.69s -> 17507.25s]  That's weird.
[17507.89s -> 17517.38s]  Did I like X out of the window?
[17517.38s -> 17517.70s]  No.
[17517.70s -> 17518.26s]  I had it up.
[17519.14s -> 17520.66s]  That's very weird.
[17525.36s -> 17525.76s]  All right.
[17526.93s -> 17527.65s]  Now I can see.
[17528.45s -> 17537.92s]  So we had huge money.
[17542.32s -> 17544.32s]  We had 50 dollars from lightning rider.
[17544.32s -> 17544.96s]  You can be here.
[17544.96s -> 17545.68s]  I believe in you.
[17545.68s -> 17547.04s]  I'm sorry that that's not true.
[17548.93s -> 17550.37s]  Thank you so much for the 50 dollars.
[17553.54s -> 17555.86s]  I wasn't going to spend the next two hours trying to do that.
[17557.70s -> 17559.38s]  Sometimes you got to accept when you can't do something.
[17561.01s -> 17562.53s]  And I'd rather just enjoy the game.
[17562.53s -> 17563.25s]  And why is the-
[17563.25s -> 17564.85s]  Who's holding the fucking horn down?
[17565.65s -> 17567.81s]  Okay.
[17567.81s -> 17568.69s]  Apparently I was.
[17569.25s -> 17571.50s]  It's a blank screen.
[17572.22s -> 17573.14s]  Shouldn't be.
[17589.42s -> 17590.54s]  Why are you doing this now?
[17594.10s -> 17595.62s]  I think I'm going to have to restart the game.
[17596.26s -> 17596.82s]  Yes, I am.
[17597.38s -> 17608.37s]  Let's try it again.
[17608.37s -> 17614.64s]  Okay.
[17615.20s -> 17615.84s]  Come on back.
[17630.21s -> 17630.77s]  Hey, look.
[17631.49s -> 17640.80s]  I didn't save right there.
[17640.80s -> 17641.44s]  So we're fine.
[17641.44s -> 17642.16s]  Resume game.
[17644.24s -> 17645.28s]  But no lightning rider.
[17645.28s -> 17645.92s]  Thank you so much.
[17646.96s -> 17648.16s]  50 fucking dollars.
[17648.16s -> 17656.38s]  And then there were 20 community subs from-
[17657.34s -> 17659.34s]  How long ago was that?
[17665.09s -> 17667.25s]  Feels good to stretch my games.
[17667.25s -> 17667.89s]  That's from Great-
[17667.89s -> 17668.85s]  Was that from Great Canadian?
[17672.14s -> 17673.34s]  Excuse me.
[17673.34s -> 17675.74s]  I don't care if you is from New York.
[17675.74s -> 17681.18s]  You ain't taking pictures of our decrappitude for no magazine, no life.
[17681.18s -> 17683.34s]  No, Cletus, it's me, Marge.
[17684.38s -> 17684.46s]  Marge.
[17684.46s -> 17685.90s]  But that's 50 dollars as well.
[17685.90s -> 17687.26s]  So thank you so much, guys.
[17691.22s -> 17693.30s]  There's been like three or four 50 dollar donations.
[17693.30s -> 17694.66s]  And then like a bunch of subs to-
[17694.66s -> 17696.19s]  Everyone better stay out of my-
[17696.19s -> 17696.59s]  Thank you.
[17698.24s -> 17700.40s]  I need some roll range.
[17700.48s -> 17702.48s]  Eat pickup, city folks.
[17702.48s -> 17704.40s]  Uh, I wasn't paying any attention to that.
[17705.28s -> 17708.72s]  I gotta hit you and then pick up your stuff that falls out of your trunk.
[17714.77s -> 17717.01s]  What the hell is going on with this game?
[17718.05s -> 17724.29s]  Sure hope no one saw that.
[17730.82s -> 17731.62s]  What is it dropping?
[17732.34s -> 17738.77s]  I'm gonna lose them.
[17743.36s -> 17746.40s]  Oh man, it's getting close to me to break my controller in half.
[17747.12s -> 17751.57s]  Arch Simpson, at your service.
[17752.61s -> 17753.41s]  Come on.
[17753.41s -> 17753.81s]  Break it.
[17755.02s -> 17755.50s]  There it goes.
[17758.27s -> 17758.99s]  Oh, I did it.
[17764.24s -> 17765.76s]  It's into- I made a switch control.
[17765.76s -> 17766.40s]  Are you serious?
[17768.61s -> 17769.09s]  Comfy.
[17769.09s -> 17769.81s]  Pretty comfy.
[17770.53s -> 17810.99s]  All right.
[17810.99s -> 17812.05s]  Can you drop another one?
[17812.77s -> 17814.19s]  Or do I have to ram you?
[17818.82s -> 17820.93s]  Why would I bring the biggest car in there?
[17840.99s -> 17841.71s]  Where are you going?
[17841.71s -> 17842.75s]  No, don't go down.
[17843.71s -> 17858.43s]  Up on two wheels.
[17861.06s -> 17866.34s]  Ten more community subs from 64fanatic.
[17866.34s -> 17866.66s]  Thank you.
[17867.38s -> 17870.74s]  Another big drop.
[17871.38s -> 17874.10s]  Speaking of big drops, can you drop the last item?
[17875.81s -> 17876.53s]  Did I win?
[17876.53s -> 17877.65s]  Thank you so much 64.
[17877.65s -> 17879.89s]  Thank you Great Canadian for your 20.
[17882.16s -> 17882.88s]  Thanks a lot guys.
[17885.49s -> 17888.21s]  Number four hours ago when you said you wouldn't get mad at this game?
[17889.58s -> 17891.98s]  Well that's- there was a lot of factors involved.
[17896.69s -> 17898.37s]  There's like four factors.
[17902.91s -> 17904.27s]  It's not just the video game.
[17911.86s -> 17912.58s]  I just have to pee.
[17913.14s -> 17914.30s]  So I'll pee again.
[17914.86s -> 17919.36s]  Who could get mad at the Simpsons?
[17920.58s -> 17922.50s]  No, I'm mad at like my computer.
[17922.50s -> 17925.55s]  That was like the alt tab bullshit from like an hour ago.
[17925.55s -> 17926.83s]  That was- that's what started the whole thing.
[17927.90s -> 17928.46s]  I was fine.
[17933.28s -> 17933.92s]  I gotta pee.
[17933.92s -> 17940.98s]  I'll be right back.
[17940.98s -> 17942.42s]  I will be right back.
[17985.95s -> 17986.59s]  you
[18015.95s -> 18016.59s]  you
[18045.95s -> 18046.59s]  you
[18076.85s -> 18076.93s]  you
[18104.62s -> 18104.94s]  Hello.
[18105.90s -> 18112.45s]  All right, where we going?
[18113.65s -> 18121.18s]  That guy looks like a cat.
[18143.76s -> 18144.96s]  Don't get your clothes dirty.
[18145.68s -> 18148.58s]  Oh, I have to buy those?
[18149.22s -> 18150.32s]  Do I have to buy them?
[18150.88s -> 18156.74s]  I don't have- I need more money.
[18170.32s -> 18171.04s]  I don't want this car.
[18171.60s -> 18172.32s]  I hate this car.
[18173.12s -> 18175.41s]  I want a car they don't hate.
[18176.21s -> 18176.93s]  How about this one?
[18183.47s -> 18183.87s]  Junk it.
[18184.98s -> 18185.70s]  Junk that one.
[18207.31s -> 18213.20s]  Lisa, why do you have to hold the horn down when I get in every time?
[18213.84s -> 18217.95s]  All right, I need to go to the uh-
[18218.59s -> 18220.51s]  Change my clothes, which is literally right in front of me.
[18225.62s -> 18227.62s]  Is this mission money or do I have to pay for this?
[18227.62s -> 18231.57s]  Do I have to pay for this, don't I?
[18232.13s -> 18236.59s]  I don't want to pay for this.
[18240.99s -> 18241.31s]  Shit.
[18241.95s -> 18245.86s]  It sticks to the gun.
[18245.86s -> 18249.54s]  It's the first gun I've seen all game.
[18272.08s -> 18273.12s]  Game save, slow skull.
[18280.98s -> 18282.10s]  Oh, no, no.
[18282.10s -> 18283.30s]  I want to use that car.
[18283.30s -> 18284.18s]  Oh, bye Lisa.
[18284.90s -> 18286.50s]  Harvest ketchup packets for the winter.
[18286.50s -> 18287.54s]  Don't let time run out.
[18287.54s -> 18288.34s]  I'll do my best.
[18290.72s -> 18291.04s]  God.
[18291.76s -> 18295.15s]  I have two minutes to get 18.
[18306.98s -> 18309.54s]  Thank god I figured that out in a quarter of a second.
[18318.82s -> 18319.94s]  Help me fetch them.
[18329.44s -> 18332.45s]  All right, hold on, hold on.
[18332.45s -> 18336.54s]  Oh, shit.
[18337.50s -> 18339.22s]  What is going on with the grass?
[18340.10s -> 18340.98s]  Fix the grass.
[18340.98s -> 18341.78s]  Fix the grass.
[18344.61s -> 18346.13s]  I don't understand what happened here.
[18349.97s -> 18356.08s]  I don't even know what I did.
[18356.08s -> 18357.28s]  I don't even know what happened.
[18358.08s -> 18361.07s]  Oh, I see another one.
[18363.73s -> 18365.23s]  It's still possible.
[18370.50s -> 18371.70s]  It's still possible.
[18371.70s -> 18372.18s]  Don't worry.
[18381.87s -> 18383.39s]  Remember these shortcuts.
[18383.39s -> 18384.27s]  Oh, I'm not gonna.
[18387.20s -> 18389.60s]  That was better than the movie box.
[18389.60s -> 18390.88s]  There's a lot of shit down here.
[18392.24s -> 18395.14s]  This last one.
[18395.86s -> 18404.69s]  I'm sorry, no, but that person should have watched where they were.
[18405.97s -> 18406.45s]  Where is it?
[18407.33s -> 18409.71s]  Is it up?
[18412.08s -> 18412.72s]  It's up.
[18412.72s -> 18412.96s]  Okay.
[18416.77s -> 18417.41s]  What?
[18417.41s -> 18420.30s]  I'll do my best.
[18424.38s -> 18425.10s]  I don't understand.
[18425.90s -> 18426.78s]  Why was it above me?
[18427.42s -> 18429.65s]  I have to go off a ramp?
[18429.65s -> 18431.89s]  We need them ketchup packets people done
[18431.89s -> 18435.01s]  thrown out to feed on during the long winter.
[18435.01s -> 18436.29s]  Help me fix you.
[18436.29s -> 18438.37s]  That's not very nice.
[18438.37s -> 18441.81s]  Hey, I know another dumpster's around here somewhere.
[18441.81s -> 18443.81s]  I can feel it in my stank bone.
[18447.34s -> 18457.20s]  I could have made a good septic system out of that.
[18461.07s -> 18462.43s]  Oh, don't crash into it.
[18462.43s -> 18463.95s]  I'm not that smart.
[18463.95s -> 18465.71s]  This is real fine.
[18465.71s -> 18472.48s]  This handling feels like shit and I'm not the one playing.
[18473.84s -> 18475.36s]  Well, this car is.
[18475.92s -> 18481.82s]  That part right there is.
[18481.82s -> 18484.46s]  Oh my god.
[18484.46s -> 18486.14s]  Before I did this mission, I looked over in the chat
[18486.14s -> 18487.98s]  and I saw somebody say, I hate this mission.
[18490.75s -> 18493.15s]  Now I think I was like, well, I wonder why.
[18493.15s -> 18504.78s]  I could have made a good septic system out of that.
[18504.78s -> 18506.30s]  I need to start over.
[18507.74s -> 18523.31s]  Oh, I can drive 55.
[18523.31s -> 18525.55s]  We need them ketchup packets people done
[18525.55s -> 18528.75s]  thrown out to feed on during the long winter.
[18528.75s -> 18529.79s]  Help me fix you.
[18530.75s -> 18533.07s]  Why are you making a septic system out of ketchup?
[18533.07s -> 18535.23s]  I know another dumpster's around here somewhere.
[18535.23s -> 18536.03s]  That's not all right.
[18536.03s -> 18536.75s]  I can feel it in my stank bone.
[18536.75s -> 18537.63s]  There's nothing even in here.
[18537.63s -> 18538.59s]  What is it?
[18538.59s -> 18539.79s]  Is it the vinegar that's in there?
[18539.79s -> 18542.19s]  Oh, that looked expensive.
[18557.14s -> 18557.78s]  Weave the needle.
[18561.04s -> 18563.04s]  All right, this is the part that gets me every time.
[18563.04s -> 18564.00s]  This little spot.
[18564.64s -> 18569.07s]  I'm not sure there's a clean way to do that.
[18569.07s -> 18570.03s]  Help me load.
[18570.03s -> 18577.54s]  Right here.
[18579.89s -> 18580.93s]  Oh, that was sloppy.
[18582.59s -> 18583.87s]  Thank god it's okay, though.
[18587.44s -> 18591.18s]  All right.
[18591.18s -> 18593.42s]  Now, so I was supposed to just drive around
[18593.42s -> 18595.10s]  and go over a ramp or something.
[18601.81s -> 18604.29s]  I wish I had some really big tires
[18604.29s -> 18606.45s]  like I saw on the TV once.
[18607.57s -> 18608.50s]  Am I supposed to?
[18608.50s -> 18609.54s]  Which way am I supposed to go?
[18609.54s -> 18610.02s]  Down here?
[18611.30s -> 18614.06s]  And then what?
[18614.06s -> 18614.54s]  Around?
[18627.34s -> 18629.42s]  Oh, I got 40 seconds to get out of here.
[18630.86s -> 18632.21s]  Oh, man.
[18632.21s -> 18632.77s]  Okay.
[18632.77s -> 18633.73s]  Please don't make it.
[18633.81s -> 18634.21s]  How do I?
[18635.17s -> 18637.74s]  Thank god.
[18637.74s -> 18638.94s]  Get away from the sedan.
[18648.24s -> 18649.68s]  That was, that one was not good.
[18657.86s -> 18658.36s]  Do it!
[18673.22s -> 18674.58s]  Don't worry, you got teleported, Marge.
[18679.54s -> 18680.18s]  Excellent work.
[18680.18s -> 18683.38s]  Look, you mind should ask some other old folks about it.
[18683.38s -> 18685.38s]  Maybe try around the graveyard.
[18685.94s -> 18687.38s]  Thanks, Cletus.
[18687.38s -> 18688.26s]  Twernt nothing.
[18689.22s -> 18690.02s]  I won?
[18690.02s -> 18690.90s]  I think I'm gonna sneeze.
[18690.90s -> 18691.54s]  I'm sorry.
[18691.54s -> 18692.50s]  In advance, I'll get it.
[18696.82s -> 18697.32s]  Okay.
[18706.96s -> 18707.60s]  Hey, you.
[18707.60s -> 18710.62s]  You just gotta help old Gilog.
[18710.62s -> 18711.18s]  Clown car.
[18711.82s -> 18713.02s]  350 coins.
[18715.36s -> 18716.32s]  The curator.
[18716.32s -> 18716.82s]  300.
[18719.33s -> 18721.25s]  I'm gonna go find some coins.
[18721.25s -> 18721.97s]  Because I need that.
[18728.03s -> 18728.91s]  Where can I get coins?
[18733.79s -> 18734.67s]  Any more secret coins?
[18739.62s -> 18741.06s]  That's a different clown car.
[18741.06s -> 18743.46s]  Well, a clown car is a clown car is a clown car.
[18743.46s -> 18743.86s]  It is.
[18743.86s -> 18745.14s]  A clown car is a clown car.
[18745.14s -> 18745.70s]  They're all cl-
[18745.70s -> 18746.42s]  It's a clown car.
[18747.38s -> 18749.82s]  When you have one clown car,
[18749.82s -> 18751.34s]  and another clown car next to a clown car,
[18751.34s -> 18752.22s]  they're all clown cars.
[18756.86s -> 18758.14s]  Who needs a clown car when you have those?
[18760.22s -> 18770.72s]  This is my new car.
[18770.72s -> 18771.22s]  Forever.
[18771.92s -> 18779.04s]  Can I save this in a garage somewhere?
[18786.99s -> 18787.95s]  All right, mole man.
[18793.68s -> 18794.40s]  What do you need?
[18794.40s -> 18796.24s]  Excuse me, Hans, mole man.
[18796.24s -> 18796.96s]  Can you help?
[18796.96s -> 18800.05s]  I'm hiding from the police.
[18800.05s -> 18802.29s]  If the police find me out past curfew,
[18802.29s -> 18804.05s]  they'll throw me in jail.
[18804.05s -> 18806.77s]  I won't survive another night in jail.
[18806.77s -> 18810.37s]  Well, I was wondering if you've ever seen a crop circle.
[18810.37s -> 18811.81s]  Talk to Abe.
[18811.81s -> 18814.13s]  He mentioned crop circles once.
[18814.13s -> 18815.65s]  Hurry up and get to the home
[18815.65s -> 18817.49s]  before the police lock the doors.
[18819.86s -> 18822.66s]  Race Chief Wiggum to the retirement castle.
[18822.66s -> 18824.58s]  Everyone better stay out of my way!
[18824.58s -> 18826.90s]  I wasn't ready.
[18829.86s -> 18832.42s]  You can't just one, two, three, go blaze by me
[18832.42s -> 18833.70s]  at like a hundred miles per hour.
[18842.06s -> 18842.94s]  Ah, I didn't go.
[18844.14s -> 18846.66s]  This thing's actually kind of making me free.
[18846.66s -> 18847.78s]  This is like hurting my brain.
[18851.60s -> 18853.20s]  When I turn the whole world,
[18853.20s -> 18854.40s]  it's like Mario Kart, man.
[18854.40s -> 18855.44s]  This is like, it hurts my head.
[18856.93s -> 18857.73s]  What the fuck?
[18867.84s -> 18869.04s]  All right, this thing's cool, but-
[18870.32s -> 18872.32s]  It's like old school Mario Kart.
[18872.88s -> 18874.80s]  And the whole world spins when you turn the car.
[18875.92s -> 18878.22s]  Oh my, really?
[18881.55s -> 18881.95s]  Okay.
[18882.59s -> 18883.79s]  Maybe I shouldn't pick this thing.
[18884.99s -> 18891.20s]  I'm gonna try this one more time.
[18922.80s -> 18926.96s]  I lost.
[18926.96s -> 18927.76s]  Unbelievable.
[18930.74s -> 18932.72s]  I gotta get rid of this thing.
[18940.38s -> 18941.90s]  I need to-
[18953.90s -> 18955.66s]  My whole body hurts.
[18959.52s -> 18961.12s]  Dude, I'm not even gonna get on this stupid thing.
[18961.12s -> 18962.88s]  Just get on a regular car.
[18997.14s -> 18998.58s]  Oh, I just killed Grandpa.
[19003.60s -> 19025.76s]  Dude, Grandpa's voice?
[19025.76s -> 19026.24s]  Okay, sure.
[19031.92s -> 19032.32s]  I can't.
[19034.70s -> 19036.14s]  No, that's not gonna happen.
[19036.14s -> 19037.02s]  That's not gonna happen.
[19037.82s -> 19038.46s]  Just kill him!
[19039.18s -> 19042.19s]  With a timer, for what?
[19055.62s -> 19056.66s]  I tried to-
[19056.66s -> 19057.54s]  Tried to correct it.
[19059.09s -> 19062.29s]  They just throw these like 25 second timers at you.
[19063.25s -> 19064.37s]  Like, all right.
[19071.34s -> 19077.74s]  That moon is massive.
[19077.74s -> 19080.16s]  This is pretty big, isn't it?
[19091.92s -> 19093.04s]  Uh, probably could have gone off.
[19093.04s -> 19094.16s]  Yeah, I could have gone off that.
[19101.57s -> 19102.72s]  Is that the-
[19102.72s -> 19103.84s]  Oh, that doesn't-
[19103.84s -> 19104.56s]  No, I gotta talk to-
[19108.56s -> 19110.24s]  You give it back right now.
[19110.24s -> 19114.00s]  Oh, we traded it to some dudes in a black car for these playdudes?
[19114.00s -> 19115.04s]  Check it out, man.
[19115.04s -> 19118.00s]  This one's got an interview with the guy who invented the wah-wah pedal.
[19133.78s -> 19135.22s]  Even Marge thinks it's nice.
[19145.09s -> 19154.27s]  Where are you going, boy?
[19156.43s -> 19165.74s]  Are you?
[19165.74s -> 19166.24s]  Okay.
[19170.59s -> 19172.43s]  I'm hitting the corner, apparently, somehow.
[19173.39s -> 19184.56s]  All right.
[19184.56s -> 19185.84s]  Like, I'm sorry.
[19185.84s -> 19190.72s]  I'm sorry, but like, follow the guy while he drops items for the 50th damn time.
[19190.72s -> 19193.71s]  I, like, come on.
[19194.43s -> 19197.06s]  What the hell?
[19197.62s -> 19209.90s]  I'm gonna lose.
[19210.62s -> 19226.46s]  You just realized you've been doing the same four missions the whole game?
[19226.46s -> 19227.98s]  I think I just realized that right now.
[19230.96s -> 19233.36s]  Am I actually just coming to that realization right now?
[19253.86s -> 19258.34s]  Let's try it again.
[19258.42s -> 19259.78s]  Hooligan's still an old man.
[19268.06s -> 19269.90s]  Leesic's driving me insane.
[19270.86s -> 19272.83s]  Give me that money.
[19273.39s -> 19276.11s]  Actually, it is.
[19276.11s -> 19278.03s]  It's quite a lot of money.
[19279.55s -> 19280.27s]  Easy, Marge.
[19306.50s -> 19307.54s]  There are reading chat.
[19314.19s -> 19314.99s]  All right, let's do it.
[19315.63s -> 19326.58s]  Oh, he did the same thing.
[19327.38s -> 19347.47s]  Which way did he do it?
[19347.47s -> 19347.95s]  Down here?
[19348.59s -> 19358.58s]  This dude's doing all kinds of fucked up moves.
[19367.01s -> 19384.50s]  Hold on.
[19384.50s -> 19386.26s]  Oh, and I have another timer.
[19386.26s -> 19391.47s]  What are you guys spanning?
[19392.19s -> 19395.52s]  What is this spam?
[19396.58s -> 19398.26s]  Dude, I can't read this yet.
[19398.26s -> 19399.46s]  Just, I can't read it.
[19401.76s -> 19402.40s]  Just wait.
[19402.40s -> 19403.36s]  I can't read that.
[19404.43s -> 19404.99s]  Get away from...
[19404.99s -> 19407.63s]  Hold on, I don't wanna fuck this up right now.
[19415.14s -> 19416.82s]  Oh my god, another...
[19417.54s -> 19418.26s]  Where?
[19418.26s -> 19418.58s]  Why?
[19445.02s -> 19446.14s]  Don't even think...
[19446.14s -> 19446.86s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[19447.90s -> 19448.86s]  That's unbelievable.
[19449.50s -> 19449.90s]  Don't...
[19449.90s -> 19451.02s]  This can't be how this ends.
[19452.06s -> 19454.24s]  Like, this can't be how this ends.
[19454.24s -> 19463.02s]  Okay, grandpa.
[19463.66s -> 19466.06s]  Power is good, Jesus.
[19466.06s -> 19467.90s]  All right, dude, you seriously suck at this game.
[19467.90s -> 19469.10s]  Play an easier game, dude.
[19469.10s -> 19471.18s]  I don't think Simpsons Hit and Run is the one for you.
[19471.18s -> 19471.82s]  Uh, I...
[19472.54s -> 19475.66s]  I should say that I put at least 2,000 hours into this game.
[19475.66s -> 19477.10s]  It's more complicated than this.
[19477.10s -> 19477.66s]  All right, that's...
[19478.38s -> 19478.62s]  Okay.
[19478.62s -> 19480.70s]  You're such a crazy, innocent grandpa.
[19481.50s -> 19482.38s]  Why?
[19482.38s -> 19482.78s]  No!
[19482.78s -> 19483.82s]  We need medication!
[19483.82s -> 19484.70s]  Gimme, gimme, gimme!
[19489.84s -> 19491.92s]  Now I need something to wake him up.
[19491.92s -> 19508.64s]  You guys...
[19509.28s -> 19510.80s]  You guys are fucking out of control.
[19520.64s -> 19523.52s]  Wait, keep the same clothes?
[19536.32s -> 19536.96s]  What, is that...
[19536.96s -> 19538.40s]  Is that a copypasta thing?
[19540.40s -> 19542.94s]  Am I getting copypasted right now?
[19543.50s -> 19562.21s]  Stop this freaking time.
[19562.21s -> 19565.17s]  Tell me about the crap circles.
[19565.17s -> 19567.81s]  There I was surrounded by Tojo and his Nazi henchmen.
[19567.81s -> 19570.13s]  When one of them, a raccoon as I recall,
[19570.13s -> 19571.41s]  hit me with a banjo.
[19571.41s -> 19572.93s]  Now I never reason with a raccoon,
[19572.93s -> 19574.29s]  let alone a Nazi one.
[19574.29s -> 19574.77s]  So I...
[19574.77s -> 19577.65s]  Grandpa, what does this have to do with the crap circle?
[19577.65s -> 19578.45s]  Not a thing.
[19578.45s -> 19579.17s]  Where was I?
[19579.17s -> 19579.81s]  Right, now.
[19579.81s -> 19581.65s]  The first time I rode in a water car...
[19581.65s -> 19582.37s]  You guys...
[19582.37s -> 19584.37s]  You guys are gonna get yourselves in trouble.
[19584.37s -> 19588.82s]  It was so long ago that I'll have to describe it in sepia tone.
[19592.24s -> 19593.52s]  You guys are gonna get in trouble.
[19636.13s -> 19638.94s]  I just got let out of a bottle.
[19638.94s -> 19640.14s]  I was inside of a bottle
[19640.14s -> 19641.74s]  and somebody like shook it and let me out.
[19642.46s -> 19648.37s]  Clown car or get wrecked.
[19648.37s -> 19649.65s]  Clown car or get wrecked.
[19650.37s -> 19651.17s]  Why don't you get wrecked?
[19665.41s -> 19668.08s]  Clown car.
[19668.08s -> 19669.28s]  Clown car or get wrecked.
[19673.84s -> 19675.44s]  I'm gonna do the entire gnome video.
[19676.24s -> 19677.44s]  You guys don't start behaving.
[19681.26s -> 19681.90s]  Over and over again.
[19681.90s -> 19683.26s]  I'm gonna do for like 20 minutes straight.
[19694.98s -> 19695.38s]  Maggie!
[19701.28s -> 19702.88s]  He's melting down.
[19702.88s -> 19704.24s]  No, I'm not melting down.
[19704.24s -> 19704.72s]  I'm not.
[19705.44s -> 19706.72s]  I've had a couple of like...
[19706.72s -> 19707.22s]  Oh!
[19707.76s -> 19708.40s]  Oh!
[19708.40s -> 19709.36s]  Moments where you go...
[19709.36s -> 19710.40s]  Oh!
[19710.40s -> 19711.04s]  What the fuck?
[19711.04s -> 19711.68s]  Oh no!
[19712.64s -> 19716.99s]  Am I missing something in there?
[19716.99s -> 19717.31s]  What?
[19717.31s -> 19717.79s]  Go to bed?
[19719.31s -> 19724.45s]  Is it going to somebody's door?
[19724.45s -> 19725.25s]  What's going on here?
[19730.43s -> 19731.31s]  In the backyard?
[19732.03s -> 19739.12s]  The door was blinking.
[19741.04s -> 19743.04s]  Give me that trading card.
[19749.09s -> 19749.59s]  Oh!
[19750.05s -> 19750.69s]  Oh!
[19750.69s -> 19751.41s]  I can't believe it!
[19758.27s -> 19760.43s]  This will be Marge's secret.
[19760.43s -> 19761.87s]  I hope this isn't stealing.
[19764.03s -> 19764.53s]  Ooh.
[19768.70s -> 19769.20s]  What?
[19770.94s -> 19771.74s]  I'm not gonna help!
[19792.96s -> 19793.76s]  Oh, he's freaking out.
[19793.76s -> 19794.56s]  He's freaking out.
[19798.64s -> 19799.68s]  Clown car time.
[19799.68s -> 19800.18s]  Not yet.
[19804.00s -> 19805.60s]  What a fucking psycho.
[19805.60s -> 19806.64s]  No, come on.
[19806.64s -> 19808.16s]  Give me a little bit of credit here.
[19809.39s -> 19811.63s]  I'm playing an old 2000s game.
[19811.63s -> 19812.43s]  It's very hard.
[19812.43s -> 19815.15s]  It's considered one of the hardest video games of the last century.
[19815.79s -> 19817.52s]  And I'm talking, yeah.
[19817.52s -> 19818.00s]  Back when...
[19818.72s -> 19819.60s]  Fucking...
[19819.60s -> 19821.28s]  Saddle's Tees, whatever his name was.
[19821.28s -> 19822.64s]  The guy, the Caesar...
[19823.68s -> 19826.72s]  That was putting people inside of a fucking dome and making them fight each other.
[19826.72s -> 19827.84s]  I'm talking that harder than that.
[19840.40s -> 19842.32s]  Dude, you seriously suck at this game.
[19842.32s -> 19843.12s]  Do something easier.
[19843.28s -> 19844.48s]  I was so worried.
[19844.48s -> 19845.04s]  I have...
[19845.04s -> 19845.76s]  I'm going to the arcade.
[19845.76s -> 19846.56s]  2,000 hours in this game.
[19846.56s -> 19849.39s]  Because the spirits eagles all the way to the top.
[19849.39s -> 19851.95s]  I need a little extra firepower.
[19851.95s -> 19856.34s]  As Officer Marge.
[19856.34s -> 19857.06s]  Serve and protect.
[19857.06s -> 19860.10s]  Purchase Marge's police uniform at the Quickie Mart Barth's room or...
[19860.10s -> 19860.82s]  I mean, there it is.
[19861.54s -> 19878.82s]  I don't have enough.
[19878.82s -> 19882.42s]  Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
[19882.42s -> 19882.92s]  I'm going.
[19883.70s -> 19885.63s]  There's no bathroom in here.
[19887.10s -> 19888.46s]  Why is everybody yelling bathroom?
[19900.62s -> 19901.26s]  Enough?
[19901.26s -> 19901.76s]  No.
[19902.06s -> 19904.27s]  I have to steal money from fucking slanders.
[19906.94s -> 19908.30s]  Hold L and R and press A, B.
[19908.30s -> 19909.50s]  I'm not cheating.
[19909.50s -> 19910.78s]  No, I'm beating this game.
[19911.82s -> 19912.70s]  Legitimately.
[19914.30s -> 19925.84s]  I got enough money.
[19926.40s -> 19927.12s]  Ready to go?
[19931.84s -> 19934.64s]  Jerma, I have over 2,000 sucks at this game.
[19934.64s -> 19935.60s]  Why did I just read that?
[19945.62s -> 19947.46s]  There's no reason for me to read what you just said.
[19955.79s -> 19957.39s]  Look at your new outfit in the window.
[19959.87s -> 19962.75s]  Run and collect all the evil Cola cans before time runs out.
[19964.38s -> 19964.88s]  What?
[19965.42s -> 19968.00s]  What? You mean out here?
[19968.64s -> 19972.37s]  Is Marge on drugs?
[19997.07s -> 19998.11s]  Aerobics classes.
[20001.50s -> 20003.10s]  Just let me catch my breath.
[20003.10s -> 20003.74s]  Should I be...
[20003.74s -> 20005.26s]  I have to be walking, right?
[20005.26s -> 20005.82s]  Listen to how my...
[20005.82s -> 20006.86s]  How would I ever do this without...
[20010.99s -> 20011.63s]  Go all the...
[20011.63s -> 20012.13s]  Yes!
[20014.30s -> 20015.02s]  Cones.
[20015.02s -> 20015.74s]  Get the coins.
[20016.78s -> 20020.98s]  Did I miss any?
[20020.98s -> 20021.78s]  I think I missed two.
[20024.19s -> 20024.83s]  Where are these?
[20025.71s -> 20026.43s]  Wait, is it...
[20026.43s -> 20026.91s]  I can go...
[20026.91s -> 20028.11s]  I can get them around, right?
[20028.99s -> 20032.23s]  Get it!
[20033.01s -> 20036.34s]  I don't...
[20036.34s -> 20036.84s]  Oh my...
[20045.06s -> 20047.10s]  I couldn't see where I was going.
[20048.22s -> 20050.18s]  I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[20050.98s -> 20053.57s]  You know, like, get these trees out of the way!
[20054.21s -> 20054.93s]  Yes!
[20054.93s -> 20057.50s]  Hold on a minute.
[20057.50s -> 20058.14s]  Can I even...
[20058.94s -> 20060.82s]  What?
[20060.82s -> 20067.49s]  Okay, so I have to go...
[20069.01s -> 20071.39s]  I guess...
[20072.43s -> 20073.55s]  It's still possible.
[20073.55s -> 20074.05s]  Maybe.
[20074.59s -> 20075.59s]  Not though.
[20076.13s -> 20081.17s]  And I figured they're all in a line.
[20081.97s -> 20095.28s]  So for next time, where's the easy way for me to get up here?
[20095.84s -> 20097.98s]  Is it around the building or from...
[20097.98s -> 20099.10s]  Do I have to jump from...
[20099.10s -> 20099.60s]  It's over here.
[20112.03s -> 20112.53s]  Camera.
[20115.30s -> 20116.50s]  I almost could have had it.
[20120.96s -> 20123.12s]  Everyone better stay out of my way!
[20123.12s -> 20129.81s]  I need a long aisle and ice tea!
[20131.49s -> 20134.29s]  I'm not allowed to fail the mission once?
[20134.29s -> 20135.41s]  To see where I need to go?
[20137.36s -> 20137.86s]  Why?
[20149.01s -> 20150.61s]  No, first try only!
[20151.41s -> 20152.85s]  Only first try!
[20152.85s -> 20153.35s]  Only!
[20169.76s -> 20173.86s]  All right, so then now I go from here.
[20173.86s -> 20174.90s]  Can you please pick it up?
[20179.81s -> 20181.78s]  Get the ones down here.
[20185.07s -> 20185.57s]  Two.
[20186.29s -> 20187.74s]  Uh...
[20193.36s -> 20195.35s]  Get a wraparound.
[20200.42s -> 20202.26s]  Why's the running and the jumping...
[20202.26s -> 20202.76s]  Is it...
[20211.75s -> 20223.35s]  I'm doing it wrong, but...
[20224.55s -> 20225.19s]  Oh man.
[20225.99s -> 20227.09s]  I still can do it.
[20234.82s -> 20236.10s]  I can still get up there, I think.
[20240.39s -> 20241.67s]  I'm just running in circles.
[20242.87s -> 20243.91s]  Yeah, whatever.
[20244.55s -> 20251.48s]  There's a better way for me to get up there.
[20252.76s -> 20255.44s]  Can I get over there from here, though?
[20256.64s -> 20257.60s]  Is it the most...
[20257.60s -> 20258.80s]  I don't even know the way to get over there.
[20259.76s -> 20260.32s]  I really don't.
[20267.67s -> 20268.87s]  Go up on the billboard.
[20335.88s -> 20336.38s]  Billboard.
[20337.00s -> 20337.50s]  Get off!
[20337.50s -> 20338.20s]  Get off of it, Marge!
[20338.20s -> 20338.76s]  What are you doing?
[20339.48s -> 20345.14s]  Get it?
[20345.14s -> 20345.64s]  Come on.
[20367.35s -> 20371.94s]  Okay, Marge.
[20373.46s -> 20374.78s]  Let's go.
[20420.64s -> 20422.24s]  I will get to the bottom of this.
[20422.24s -> 20424.48s]  Well, it made Bart go crazy.
[20424.48s -> 20428.24s]  And if I find the distributor, I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind.
[20428.24s -> 20429.84s]  Careful, Mrs. Simpson.
[20429.84s -> 20433.20s]  This cola makes people do irrational things without guilt.
[20433.20s -> 20437.04s]  It is as though they have bottled the effects of a raging fratkegger.
[20437.04s -> 20437.84s]  That's it.
[20437.84s -> 20439.60s]  I'm going after it.
[20439.60s -> 20442.08s]  And any other evil cola trucks I can find.
[20446.18s -> 20447.14s]  I'll do my best.
[20449.25s -> 20450.69s]  I will destroy them.
[20450.69s -> 20455.17s]  I will try.
[20455.17s -> 20455.67s]  Okay.
[20457.12s -> 20457.92s]  Kill trucks.
[20458.56s -> 20462.68s]  Slow and steady wins the race.
[20462.68s -> 20464.52s]  Dump fucking toxic waste on them.
[20479.59s -> 20481.19s]  Isn't I the right vehicle for this?
[20481.19s -> 20482.63s]  Am I gonna have to do the whole Marge thing?
[20482.63s -> 20483.51s]  No, sit up!
[20483.51s -> 20486.69s]  Because I might have to do the whole stupid soda can thing again.
[20486.69s -> 20515.41s]  Oh, God, no.
[20515.41s -> 20516.85s]  Smashy, Smashy!
[20517.81s -> 20522.37s]  I'm so totally embarrassed.
[20523.17s -> 20524.85s]  Gamer, sit up!
[20524.85s -> 20532.40s]  I'm not doing enough damage.
[20538.64s -> 20541.92s]  Oh, somehow I pancaked him into the wall.
[20543.54s -> 20544.04s]  And that...
[20544.68s -> 20545.18s]  That...
[20548.44s -> 20548.94s]  Alright.
[20549.64s -> 20550.68s]  Whatever.
[20551.24s -> 20551.98s]  Let's go.
[20566.17s -> 20567.61s]  Oh, shit.
[20567.61s -> 20568.97s]  Let's do it!
[20568.97s -> 20572.55s]  This car doesn't stink too bad.
[20573.11s -> 20578.01s]  Come here, loser!
[20578.65s -> 20583.58s]  Get over here, loser!
[20594.18s -> 20595.38s]  How's that not any damage?
[20599.83s -> 20602.55s]  Alright, when he drives accidentally, gently into the wall,
[20602.55s -> 20605.11s]  it's more damage than flying off a goddamn cliff.
[20605.99s -> 20630.26s]  I just polished that.
[20630.26s -> 20632.62s]  Into the wall.
[20633.10s -> 20643.67s]  Yeah, I love the Tom Arnold music. No, that's an actor. What's his name?
[20644.55s -> 20659.01s]  What the fuck are you doing? Why would you do that to me? I need you to drive into a wall or into another car or anything.
[20659.85s -> 20662.07s]  Into this wall!
[20662.07s -> 20663.63s]  Into something!
[20663.63s -> 20665.93s]  Into the wall!
[20665.93s -> 20669.07s]  Why does that not do any damage to you?
[20674.84s -> 20676.28s]  Okay.
[20676.28s -> 20678.96s]  Those two head-on car crashes.
[20679.84s -> 20684.85s]  He got smashed into that car head-on.
[20687.95s -> 20692.30s]  How did it blow up the first time? Because it bumped into a pole.
[20693.02s -> 20716.98s]  It smacked its side into a little medium and it destroyed it. I have to get a bigger car.
[20717.94s -> 20719.94s]  Yeah, probably.
[20721.06s -> 20726.66s]  I can't, this is just gonna get a lot better. Just, hello Superman. I'd like to fucking report a disturbance.
[20727.30s -> 20752.30s]  I'm sorry. Could you give me a lift? Too bad he didn't use the clown car. I am. Just wait till he comes over here.
[20752.62s -> 20761.46s]  Come on.
[20765.06s -> 20816.02s]  Look at these full rams. Get very good at this. Same, that was the same guy.
[20825.95s -> 20827.07s]  He's gonna drive.
[20827.07s -> 20834.35s]  I should pay more attention. Do I get credit for that? No, he's still alive. He's still alive. Yeah. Okay, great. That's fantastic.
[20834.99s -> 20847.14s]  He just drove off the cliff into the ocean and he's still alive. All right, he just-
[20850.82s -> 20853.54s]  I don't understand. He just crashed like three times.
[20854.34s -> 20870.72s]  Here comes another one. Maybe I can get- see? Where was the damage on that? He just drove straight into that guy.
[20886.88s -> 20891.66s]  I used to give my controller bite marks because of this game.
[20897.28s -> 20916.85s]  Wait a second. That's so funny. Oh no, did I blow it?
[20921.92s -> 20935.82s]  I'm gonna lose. Oh, die. Bite marks.
[20942.16s -> 20950.98s]  I just beat every mission. Oh, give it a rest, all right? No way. I don't believe you. I don't believe you for a minute.
[20956.70s -> 20959.18s]  I see some of you guys in this chat with your mouths going
[20963.39s -> 20976.78s]  You bit your controller because you lost one of these missions like 15 times in a row. I know it. I'm certain of that.
[20988.35s -> 20991.31s]  I mean, I didn't even have to say it. Somebody just talked about how they were biting things.
[21001.68s -> 21009.98s]  So, come on.
[21009.98s -> 21011.98s]  I have two thousand hours.
[21024.93s -> 21029.09s]  No, this car is gonna explode. I can't do it here. No, I don't want a bite me thing.
[21031.07s -> 21033.71s]  If this car explodes, I'm turning on the webcam and I'm biting someone.
[21043.63s -> 21060.91s]  Jerma, how is it possible that you could be this bad?
[21065.79s -> 21067.79s]  Oh, is it possible?
[21067.79s -> 21076.03s]  It's the only thing that gives me the courage to take off my shirt in the station locker room. You're going down.
[21080.18s -> 21095.60s]  Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler.
[21097.52s -> 21101.49s]  Jerma, I mean, look at me.
[21130.29s -> 21142.26s]  30, whatever. 30 percent? Did he get 30 percent? I don't, I can't, there's no noise I can even do.
[21144.69s -> 21156.32s]  30 percent? I can't, I can't. Wait, new character? Nice.
[21168.61s -> 21176.29s]  Armored truck. Armored truck. Armored truck. Jerma sucks. Jerma sucks. All right. I don't want to like keep pushing that.
[21190.59s -> 21192.99s]  Just stop throwing rocks at my house.
[21209.81s -> 21212.61s]  I hear like, this is all, this is what I hear right now. I hear like,
[21215.78s -> 21222.88s]  get him. Did they fucking throw rocks at my house? Who's doing this? All right, open up my front door.
[21225.20s -> 21228.72s]  In my mouth. And then I close the door really fast. I got hit in the face with a rock.
[21244.75s -> 21248.10s]  We got him cornered. What does he want me to do?
[21248.66s -> 21254.14s]  300 million? How? Hurry up or my arranged bride will chastise me.
[21261.25s -> 21266.05s]  I have been selling tainted cola. Unless I redeem myself, I will be reincarnated as a sea cucumber.
[21266.05s -> 21272.21s]  Throw more rocks. Or worse, a land cucumber. I must find the source of this evil beverage.
[21272.21s -> 21276.37s]  The Soda Invo is commanded I go here. They're just whipping rocks at my house.
[21276.93s -> 21279.89s]  I look over, I'm like, what are they even, why, what are they saying?
[21280.61s -> 21290.38s]  I am the greatest driver in all the land. Follow the coal truck and collect all the evidence.
[21290.38s -> 21295.26s]  Don't miss any coal. I must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the
[21295.26s -> 21300.86s]  odor of the hot dog machine. Who put this here? It makes no sense. This is just between me and
[21300.86s -> 21327.46s]  you, random object. Is this the armor truck thing that you guys talking about? Holy shit.
[21336.00s -> 21339.28s]  Will I know if it's the armor truck level because will there be rocks thrown at my house?
[21339.84s -> 21419.26s]  What is that? I don't know. Talk to Louie at the legitimate business thing. I will later.
[21421.26s -> 21439.95s]  Hello? Hello, stereotypical Italians. Please do tell me the source of the evil cola.
[21439.95s -> 21444.35s]  We don't know nothing. Except that the brands are controlled by mysterious strangers.
[21444.43s -> 21447.79s]  Anyway, you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's business.
[21447.79s -> 21453.47s]  It could come back to haunt you and your family. Oh my gosh, your thinly veiled threat
[21453.47s -> 21458.11s]  has reminded me of my fatherly duties. I'm supposed to pick up the octoplets at the doctor's.
[21460.03s -> 21463.87s]  Drive to the hospital before time runs out. Avoid them all. Hopefully my store will not
[21463.87s -> 21469.73s]  be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today. There's a time limit
[21537.28s -> 21548.61s]  Got it. I'm actually not sure what the hell I just did. Oh no, my babies. Your babies
[21548.61s -> 21553.01s]  are about to go to the bathroom all over my waiting room and diapers aren't covered by your
[21553.01s -> 21557.55s]  insurance. You better hurry. I heard the parents of the Shelby bill nine are grabbing
[21557.55s -> 21562.67s]  every diaper in town. I will get the diapers but there's no way I could fit them in my car.
[21562.67s -> 21566.59s]  Maybe Mr. Homer will have a large gas guzzling American vehicle that I could use.
[21567.55s -> 21572.72s]  To complete this mission you will need Homer's custom-built car.
[21573.76s -> 21578.80s]  Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot for 500 coins or call it from a phone.
[21579.92s -> 21590.86s]  How much money do I have? Thankfully there's bugs over here with money.
[21592.40s -> 21624.05s]  500. I'm gonna have to do some exploring. Hmm I see over here. Sick. Please drink water.
[21624.13s -> 21631.65s]  It's been six hours. I haven't I've been getting a drink. You guys don't really think
[21631.65s -> 21640.27s]  I'm just sitting here like. Help! Help me! I'm trying out! If you give me a ride I will pay
[21640.27s -> 21649.28s]  you a million dollars in the next life I promise. This is not good for my insurance.
[21651.68s -> 21659.12s]  It's a couple of coins and there's a wrench. I need way more than this.
[21669.31s -> 21676.77s]  Well we got another mission here. Excuse me nice Mr. Shopkeeper person. Have you seen a
[21676.77s -> 21684.45s]  hovering death machine? No nothing specifically of the hovering kind no. Oh this was to be my
[21684.45s -> 21689.33s]  greatest invention since side burns in a can. They make you handsome and lovely. What are
[21689.33s -> 21694.69s]  you talking about? I call it the hover car tm. So don't try to steal the name it's tm'd.
[21694.69s -> 21699.49s]  I installed the onboard computer and it came alive and attacked my person. With the love
[21699.49s -> 21704.05s]  of all that's gliding you gotta help me here. Okay what on earth can I do? Knock the
[21704.05s -> 21708.93s]  flesh rigging the thing off the road before the authorities come and take me away again.
[21708.93s -> 21713.89s]  Prisons ain't kind to pencil neck geeks like myself. They they stomp and they kick.
[21715.74s -> 21719.34s]  Jerva died hours ago we're just hearing the gases releasing.
[21719.50s -> 21724.54s]  Better hurry. That's why I left this door hoodlums put pornography in the bridal magazines.
[21727.87s -> 21729.39s]  What are you talking about?
[21746.58s -> 21751.20s]  Oh look you fucked it up didn't you?
[21761.42s -> 21765.50s]  What are you trying to pull with this crazy driving?
[21766.46s -> 21775.38s]  What in the hell were you thinking? It's a Futurama reference. I know when they squeeze
[21775.38s -> 21782.48s]  on him and he goes. I've seen that video. I've seen that movie. I've seen that TV program.
[21812.32s -> 21823.09s]  That's not a shortcut. So I get this car. Don't you guys tell me?
[21826.62s -> 21838.93s]  Move. The opponent in every direction arrows.
[21858.00s -> 21869.97s]  No no no. Hey professor how are you? Great my Hindu friend. Do not patronize my faith okay.
[21869.97s -> 21875.97s]  Sorry terribly sorry. Look if you need a ride instant message my cortex by which I mean
[21876.77s -> 21884.43s]  call me. Thank you all for coming. I'll see you in hell. Professor Frank's hover car. Go to a
[21884.43s -> 21918.35s]  phone booth to use it. Is it good? Damn. Can you hide all the spoilers?
[21921.17s -> 21925.44s]  In the game there are no spoilers. What are you talking about?
[21937.04s -> 21941.36s]  You better hurry. I heard the parents of the show be building on to grabbing every diaper in town.
[21941.36s -> 21944.96s]  I will get the diapers but there's no way I could fit them in my car.
[21944.96s -> 21948.96s]  Maybe Mr. Homer will have a large gas guzzling American vehicle that I could use.
[21950.56s -> 21961.78s]  Oh that's right. I need 500 coins. Shit. Find them. This is just between me and you.
[21961.78s -> 21974.21s]  I need a lot. Oh okay. This way. Some coins. I need to go explore.
[21974.85s -> 21994.13s]  Looking for some kind of... close enough. Yes I am. Am I...
[21997.68s -> 22017.07s]  Am I enjoying the game? Uh yeah. I think so. I mean no. Am I in... I am not.
[22020.59s -> 22024.00s]  He's not. Why? Because I went...
[22024.96s -> 22031.12s]  Something along those lines. And I said he's throwing rocks at me.
[22032.00s -> 22044.29s]  That's what I think that's what I remember saying. Oh that was pretty badass.
[22046.29s -> 22068.27s]  I need you. Come here. Did I go far enough? Can I even jump on this?
[22071.55s -> 22080.40s]  It'd be just great if the camera could turn. I guess I can't go on that.
[22082.37s -> 22108.03s]  Did I not get that coin? All right there's probably a box up here. Or a bee? Any bees?
[22108.75s -> 22112.85s]  I don't see a bee and I don't... oh there we go. And there's a box up here.
[22121.23s -> 22136.18s]  500 right? And there's another bee. Good. Uh come here. I don't want you to spill coins.
[22136.18s -> 22146.91s]  All of them. I'm not gonna be able to get them. You're shooting at me. Okay. I shouldn't have
[22146.91s -> 22163.09s]  bought all those dumb clothes. I'd have way more money. I'm not even close. Actually I can go
[22163.09s -> 22176.78s]  from here to there. Ah interesting. Can I get up there still? Windowsill? No. Well I need to get
[22176.78s -> 22194.93s]  back on that roof. What else can I do? Something on the other side? No. Nice jump. I couldn't
[22194.93s -> 22201.04s]  have made it. I could not have made it. I see you with a rock in your hand. Put it down.
[22201.68s -> 22223.36s]  There's no reason for that. Can I get up here? Let me see. Can I make it? I guess I can
[22223.36s -> 22239.87s]  make it from here to there. Can I? There's that little ledge right here but can I just make that?
[22239.87s -> 22250.58s]  Am I lined up? It's like the claw machine. Okay. Uh this side is more important.
[22250.58s -> 22259.82s]  No! What the fuck? What the fuck? Uh it just pushed me off. I didn't touch anything.
[22260.38s -> 22279.09s]  I just kind of fell off. Well let's do it again. I think I can just jump. But I could
[22279.09s -> 22291.65s]  probably do it. Okay. Now let's try this again. All right. Good. Good. Good. Kill the bee.
[22292.61s -> 22303.42s]  We're almost there to the last mission of the game. Can you see how close we are?
[22304.58s -> 22319.79s]  Final mission incoming. There's another platform over here.
[22323.20s -> 22334.06s]  No. There's like three more levels. Yeah so we're at the final one. After those two.
[22335.02s -> 22372.30s]  From here uh is this the other building? Not the same one. All right. Need more money. Car wash.
[22372.86s -> 22386.58s]  Nothing. Wait. Nothing in the car. I already got the car wash money. The next level is bot and then homo.
[22393.20s -> 22402.98s]  Bot, bot, homo. Mod. I see coins up there. Is there a way for me to get up there?
[22403.62s -> 22420.90s]  Uh what's the blue one right there? Can I interact with this? I don't like it.
[22421.62s -> 22440.18s]  Hurry up or my arranged bride will chastise me. What do stairs do? Are there stairs over here?
[22440.82s -> 22448.91s]  On one of these box cars? You did this earlier. Yeah I know but I'm one of the
[22448.91s -> 22460.90s]  characters. Can't go in. That was an incredible move. There might be another way. I guess I
[22460.90s -> 22474.99s]  could go on a car and then anywhere inside that I can go. It makes no sense. No random place I can
[22474.99s -> 22495.78s]  go in the corner or something. I don't think so. Well I can probably jump from. I can't jump from
[22495.78s -> 22511.90s]  that. Can I jump from this? I'm stuck on that. Uh can I? I don't know. I'm not going to go
[22512.06s -> 22532.83s]  from there. Just go up the stairs. I mean talking about all the way back here.
[22538.43s -> 22541.87s]  Can I make it from here to there? I'm going to have to run very far away.
[22542.75s -> 22545.79s]  I have to go all the way across. Is there anything over there? There's nothing even
[22545.79s -> 22549.87s]  over there. What am I getting? I did this earlier. Yeah but I'm talking about over
[22551.07s -> 22554.51s]  past that top of that thing over there. No that's what I get.
[22555.39s -> 22560.03s]  I'm not talking about getting to where those coins are. I'm talking about the other side.
[22563.94s -> 22609.09s]  I'm talking like down there. So do it. 500. Is he on drugs? Uh no. When you hold run in this game
[22609.89s -> 22612.37s]  it makes you it forces you to go into a straight line.
[22613.57s -> 22617.41s]  So for about a half second when you run you have to go in the direction that you
[22617.41s -> 22622.85s]  started the run. You can't turn. So it's like whoop. Sometimes you fall. Sometimes you slip.
[22636.02s -> 22647.30s]  Why did I jump down? Because I have 500 coins. I don't want that card.
[22654.35s -> 22670.77s]  All right. Buy it. 500. Where is it? I thought I could buy it from the
[22671.65s -> 22683.34s]  from here right? Can I buy it from here? You have to buy it from home. I thought you could
[22683.34s -> 22694.11s]  buy it from a phone. No. You have to talk to Homer about that.
[22696.35s -> 22698.51s]  Were there a bunch of other scenarios where I just get it from home?
[22699.23s -> 22721.18s]  He said you can summon it at a phone. That's what I thought. If you own it.
[22744.03s -> 22758.38s]  Get out of the way. Excuse me. All right. Springfield Park. Springfield Hospital is
[22758.38s -> 22776.19s]  down this way over there. Park. Hello Homer. I'll take your custom car please.
[22776.19s -> 22786.06s]  Do you have an oversized vehicle? Whoops. Okay there it is. Car built for Homer. 500 coins.
[22786.62s -> 22795.50s]  Must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[22795.66s -> 22807.60s]  I hit the van and collected the diapers. In Homer's underwater taxi.
[22813.04s -> 22821.38s]  I thought he was going over the thing. Hold on. Itchy nose. Not good. I gotta restart.
[22835.14s -> 22840.32s]  All right. Who is in this car? Who the fuck is in this car?
[22856.94s -> 22866.58s]  Uh ambulance come please. Use horn. Use horn.
[22877.31s -> 22883.89s]  This guy's driving me wrong. This guy's freaking me out. Bad big time.
[22886.40s -> 22902.96s]  Okay drive to the hospital. All right talk to Dr. Hibbert. All right final mission incoming.
[22910.00s -> 22928.48s]  Shiva H Vishnu. My jubilation knows no bounds. Here we are at the destination.
[22929.44s -> 22937.22s]  That was way too fast. Here we are at our final destination. It's just between me and you
[22937.22s -> 22953.15s]  random object. I know my face cam is not on. Why? There's no reason. Put down the rocks.
[22954.03s -> 22964.70s]  Famous American clown. I wish to ask a favor. Everyone wants to wet their beaks.
[22965.74s -> 22972.03s]  Require information about drugs delivering evil cola. How can I get this classified data?
[22972.03s -> 22975.71s]  Sorry Apu. I'm a drink squeezy punchy lowlife. You need a professional scumbag.
[22975.71s -> 22979.95s]  We're putting them down by throwing them. Follow a cop until you find one.
[22979.95s -> 22985.63s]  You'll have better luck if you, you know, look American. Thank you horrible man.
[22987.79s -> 22995.01s]  Need a disguise purchase. Who's American clothes? Another 425 coins. Shit.
[22998.94s -> 23004.94s]  My giant gut is is slowing me down. Oh Shiva smiles on such behavior. 57 coins.
[23005.66s -> 23016.03s]  All right we have to scrounge around now. Fathering eight children has really hurt my
[23016.03s -> 23019.07s]  stomach. We gotta find boxes. We gotta find soda machines. There's a box over here.
[23020.19s -> 23028.02s]  Do a wager race. To catch my breath. We've seen how much of a disaster those were.
[23030.56s -> 23054.00s]  I should sleep more. All right not a bad start. My cardio is shot. Destroy cars.
[23064.64s -> 23076.90s]  Another box right here. And a bee. That took a lot longer than it should have.
[23077.70s -> 23106.67s]  400 right or was it 425? Nothing, nothing, nothing. My giant gut is is slowing me down.
[23107.63s -> 23126.24s]  What about the statues? I need to get in a car. How about one of my cars?
[23126.88s -> 23136.18s]  Fathering eight children has really hurt my stamina. Try doing a race with a hover car.
[23141.17s -> 23145.57s]  Sure my robo roommate is being a jerk and I need to get out.
[23145.57s -> 23148.61s]  So let's try whatever you got here. There's a box behind you.
[23149.81s -> 23160.27s]  Hey aren't you the boy who nearly drowned in the nacho cheese? I was in the newspaper.
[23164.10s -> 23170.59s]  All right. Do I actually get money for these? I'm gonna hit it.
[23178.75s -> 23196.32s]  This is a slippery course. Wait. Did they block off most of these ways to skip through?
[23200.66s -> 23202.82s]  Um I think I'm gonna have to restart this.
[23214.34s -> 23224.99s]  This is a lost cause right now. Unless I can... I don't think I can do anything. No.
[23225.79s -> 23243.63s]  Maybe I could have like spun around. Um is this even this is not even gonna give me money.
[23244.83s -> 23259.79s]  If I beat this do I get points? I don't think that's gonna happen. Maybe.
[23276.99s -> 23281.36s]  The journey is the reward. No that's true.
[23285.31s -> 23299.20s]  Mmm floaty. I'm really floaty. I will tell you. I don't think I'm ever gonna do this.
[23299.92s -> 23307.68s]  He's about to beat me isn't he? I wonder why. Maybe it's because you are literally floating.
[23308.64s -> 23337.44s]  A little too floaty. It's not even gonna give me money at this point. The fresh air is somewhat
[23337.44s -> 23371.97s]  confusing. Hit it. What? I just fell off. I got a feeling I'll get it up here. Maybe.
[23372.13s -> 23422.08s]  Possible. Oh god. Almost there. 100 more coins and it's done. Ride the mon- ride on the monorail.
[23422.08s -> 23442.03s]  Bites the monorail. Oh what have I got this? This looks...
[23443.23s -> 23457.58s]  All right I'll try to get on the monorail. Wow that was close.
[23458.30s -> 23475.58s]  Okay well hold on a second here Jeremy. Um this little lip right here? Okay. Oh why am
[23475.58s -> 23499.81s]  I sliding? I just had it. Okay well that's... I couldn't get back up there. Not allowed up
[23499.81s -> 23512.67s]  there. You're just very silly. You're a foolish person. Now he's gonna think that's the right
[23512.67s -> 23518.99s]  way. No I think that's the wrong way. Hey watch it buster. I think that's the incorrect way.
[23519.87s -> 23530.50s]  Or do I? We'll never know. I'm stuck on my car. All right I got uh there is...
[23531.30s -> 23539.55s]  Can I get up there? I'm trying to like look up. So I already did this though didn't I? Hold
[23539.55s -> 23565.58s]  on. This shit over here. So close. Gag. Any more vending machines back here? When I see a truck
[23566.46s -> 23595.47s]  I'm gonna go on top. This looks platformy doesn't it? 95. Oh really where is it? It's not...
[23595.47s -> 23605.34s]  Can I not grab it from there? I... oh all right. I thought I could get it by just jumping.
[23606.14s -> 23623.63s]  Can I get up there? I think I can. Hold on. I don't think so. Whatever I need like three coins.
[23623.63s -> 23643.68s]  Let's just go. There is another vending machine over here I think. What was it? Something up
[23643.68s -> 23656.35s]  here. Done. All right let's do the last mission in the game.
[23657.07s -> 23665.60s]  Speaking two bodies cannot eye the same seat. Why have I been streaming for seven hours?
[23666.90s -> 23673.49s]  Um I don't know. I like streaming. It's fun. I want to beat this game and
[23674.69s -> 23701.84s]  I don't know. He only kind of likes streaming. Professor Frank rides again. Crusty. I must
[23701.84s -> 23706.72s]  finish quickly or vomit. Uh do I have to buy the costume? Or can I get it from somewhere
[23706.72s -> 23728.88s]  besides? I think I have to buy the costume first don't I? Yeah I need the clothes right?
[23730.70s -> 23751.97s]  300 horses of convenient power. I need to buy clothes. Can I get some clothes in this
[23751.97s -> 23775.44s]  vicinity? Clothes are at Moe's. This is not good for my insurance.
[23779.89s -> 23791.33s]  You should not have stepped in front of my car. I wish there was a indicator where a
[23791.33s -> 23797.65s]  place like that was. Because I'm not I can't I can't memorize where every storefront is.
[23807.63s -> 23810.03s]  Perhaps I should refrain from doing that in the future.
[23815.02s -> 23859.89s]  It can't be like a shirt blip or something. Okay I need this. Now we go. Wrong clothes. I
[23859.89s -> 23866.53s]  know it's the right clothes. I know it's the right one. You would have heard a very loud
[23866.53s -> 23877.42s]  panic if I figured out that I did something wrong. Thank you for not dodging the famous
[23877.42s -> 23882.14s]  American clown. I wish to ask a favor. Everyone wants to wet their beaks.
[23884.06s -> 23889.50s]  I require information about drugs delivering evil cola. How can I get this classified data?
[23889.50s -> 23895.50s]  Sorry Apu. I'm a drink squeezy punchy lowlife. You need a professional scumbag. Follow
[23895.50s -> 23902.38s]  a cop until you find one. You'll have better luck if you you know look American. Thank you
[23902.38s -> 23913.98s]  horrible man. Look at my new outfit. What? Follow the police to find a criminal.
[23920.14s -> 23922.85s]  Follow the trail of donuts.
[23923.25s -> 23950.53s]  What is here? It makes no sense. 21 donuts. You're weaving them around don't they?
[23954.62s -> 23963.22s]  This crazy driving. What the hell is that guy doing? I smashed my skull.
[23971.38s -> 23973.94s]  Got it. Follow Chief Wiggum to find a professional criminal.
[23979.41s -> 24013.06s]  He's kind of hard to follow. He's kind of insane. Find the criminal please.
[24041.92s -> 24049.50s]  No why would you do that? Why would you just try to kill me?
[24061.50s -> 24066.06s]  Found him. This is totally a mugging. Well what good luck a criminal.
[24066.06s -> 24071.10s]  Huh? Surely a violent filth bag such as yourself could find out who is driving the
[24071.10s -> 24077.98s]  black cola vans. Well I do have a connection at the DMV but it will cost you. You have to
[24077.98s -> 24084.22s]  pick up the litter from my community's service. It is a deal. Deal. Now hand over your wallet.
[24084.78s -> 24091.79s]  Yes yes whatever. Not fun mission coming up here. Collect all the garbage before time runs out.
[24091.79s -> 24095.39s]  Don't miss any pieces of garbage. The smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the
[24095.39s -> 24102.51s]  odor of the hot dog machine. I am a lean mean Vindaloo machine. Follow the garbage truck and
[24102.51s -> 24108.51s]  collect the garbage. Armored garbage truck? Garbage truck is what you guys were talking
[24108.51s -> 24147.42s]  about before. I shouldn't be getting time docked down for this. Four and give me a five. What
[24147.42s -> 24167.81s]  do you say? Give me. Drop it. Collect the remaining garbage. How did I just lose time?
[24172.34s -> 24176.18s]  Wait hold on. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[24176.18s -> 24190.45s]  do I have to go up top? Do I have to get out of the car? No I don't. Watch out.
[24201.36s -> 24202.96s]  Oh fuck I do have to get out of the car.
[24217.52s -> 24228.75s]  Back to the train. Oh no. Oh I didn't think oh man I thought I had a chance. I thought it
[24228.83s -> 24249.84s]  wasn't. Man all this. Oh I hate this. Oh no. What am I doing in this car? Now give me a better
[24249.84s -> 24260.62s]  car. I need I need to have like the best possible scenario here. No no no. I need
[24261.42s -> 24268.00s]  I had two minutes. I probably yeah but I didn't want to give myself the opportunity to do that.
[24271.20s -> 24274.32s]  This just wasn't going to happen. I would have got to the end and it would have been
[24274.32s -> 24276.56s]  ten seconds left and I would have lost and I would have been so angry.
[24281.06s -> 24296.02s]  I'm just gonna get the sedan. My giant gut is slowing me down. I mean this car is pretty
[24296.02s -> 24300.18s]  great actually. I will pay you a million dollars in the next life. What's the difference
[24300.18s -> 24321.07s]  between this and the homework car? Where is it? I can't let this mission be physical pain for
[24321.07s -> 24332.91s]  me but it could be. The pain has already begun. Put it like right in the fucking side of the building.
[24339.28s -> 24344.24s]  I must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.
[24351.26s -> 24357.57s]  You gotta get out on foot. I just got up. I wish I didn't have to do this part.
[24358.29s -> 24362.83s]  What are you doing?
[24390.59s -> 24401.01s]  All right so he just drove straight into the other one. That wasn't even my fault. I
[24401.01s -> 24409.65s]  wasn't even touching him. All right get the last of the garbage. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm
[24409.65s -> 24417.10s]  ready to do it. I'm ready to do it. Here we go. We've got um I'm gonna turn. Here's
[24417.10s -> 24428.18s]  what I'm gonna do. This way first. Go over the jump. Out of the car.
[24428.82s -> 24447.62s]  A ranged bride will chastise me. Okay out. The car's right here.
[24447.62s -> 24463.33s]  I think eight children has really hurt my stamina. Just give me a minute.
[24464.13s -> 24477.34s]  I gotta be careful. Can I even make this shit? I should sleep more.
[24480.75s -> 24497.09s]  All right that's it. Get me back in the car. Oh my god. Punch that guy in the face.
[24499.89s -> 24525.90s]  Around this way. In here? Oh Jesus. Why? The like clippy little bullshit.
[24527.30s -> 24543.78s]  I'm trying to double jump. Just do it. All right now what? I got this over.
[24543.78s -> 24546.82s]  There's so many other ones that I missed already. Give me the car.
[24548.83s -> 24559.71s]  This two back there. Wrap around this way. Where are they? Get out of the car.
[24559.71s -> 24562.67s]  Out out out out out out out out out out out out out out out out.
[24564.94s -> 24588.05s]  Can I walk it? Do I have? Get out of the car! No!
[24589.01s -> 24597.82s]  G-Money crickets. The fresh air is somewhat confusing.
[24602.86s -> 24606.99s]  My cardio is shocked. Looks like the end of the road for Apu.
[24606.99s -> 24639.84s]  Hopefully my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today.
[24639.84s -> 24652.67s]  Oh no. That's not fair. That's not fair. It's not fair.
[24654.80s -> 24671.10s]  No! Oh I'm so defeated. I did it too and I- no I had it. I win.
[24672.06s -> 24675.18s]  I'm so defeated.
[24683.01s -> 24687.33s]  I didn't fight any controllers. No and I like forget everything already.
[24688.61s -> 24695.78s]  I just every extra two seconds being in that extra half of a second being in that car.
[24696.66s -> 24704.66s]  I could have just used the car for the last part but I didn't know. I didn't I didn't know.
[24704.66s -> 24718.02s]  I didn't know. I got it. I'm gonna get it. Oh I've lost it. I've lost it. All my energy is expelled.
[24724.32s -> 24742.64s]  Get out of here! Punch that guy in the face! Okay here we go. Just remember.
[24744.13s -> 24750.85s]  I have to remember. You must remember. Go around. Jump. Grab. Car on the other side.
[24752.05s -> 24755.65s]  Why would you put that last one there? Why did you put the last one in the worst-
[24766.08s -> 24794.72s]  No! I haven't lost yet.
[24798.86s -> 24801.98s]  I haven't lost. I'm getting stuck in everything. If I don't make this jump
[24803.42s -> 24816.82s]  a bite mark is gonna go. Oh my god mommy! He can't sprint faster than this.
[24821.54s -> 24834.29s]  Let's go.
[24858.26s -> 24882.08s]  Get in!
[24882.16s -> 24891.38s]  I got him. What is the blip doing? What's the what was the what's the blip doing?
[24894.22s -> 24940.14s]  Why was the minimap freaking out? Out of the fucking way. Get out of my way. Out of my way.
[24940.14s -> 24948.32s]  Finish quickly or vomit. My friend has the information. The DMV. Go pick it up pronto.
[24948.32s -> 24950.48s]  Thank you. Thank you my violent associate.
[24952.64s -> 24966.83s]  Okay I did it. Empty. I am the victim of the canary most vile. That's it Appu.
[24966.83s -> 24988.96s]  Make them like it. That was not that bad but it was. If I even took- wait hold on. If I took
[24988.96s -> 24998.69s]  even five one or two three extra seconds getting the items I would've lost. Sir this
[24998.69s -> 25005.01s]  folder is empty. To rob me is one thing but I never expected you to lie. Dude relax okay.
[25005.01s -> 25009.33s]  I've got the info you need. I just need help with a little more. That mission was actually pretty
[25009.33s -> 25015.65s]  easy. Don't worry. Oh I'm totally evil. I should know better than to trust that demented
[25015.65s -> 25021.60s]  chuckle. But okay. Help Snake with his community service destroy the armored
[25022.16s -> 25031.17s]  car and avoid Chief Wiggum. Has this seven hour stream culminated to this point right here?
[25036.94s -> 25046.51s]  Don't throw any rocks. Don't throw rocks at me.
[25075.34s -> 25080.54s]  We both would have gone. Listen you two. This is not the time for you to do this right now.
[25081.18s -> 25095.84s]  Let's lose the tail. That person got fucking destroyed.
[25111.12s -> 25112.48s]  Still got a tail on me here?
[25115.12s -> 25133.26s]  Destroy the armored car.
[25141.09s -> 25146.48s]  Come on into a wall and I'll get it immediately.
[25151.30s -> 25157.41s]  This car's gonna explode. I just gotta get him to drive into a wall.
[25157.97s -> 25163.33s]  You better not have scratched my car. You just drive this motherfucker straight into a wall.
[25170.90s -> 25180.11s]  No timer. That's a good thing. I am a lean mean vindaloo machine. I'm going to mess you up.
[25180.75s -> 25197.92s]  That was pretty good but didn't do much damage. Right into the wall. Oh fuck you.
[25198.88s -> 25202.48s]  How did you get so good at driving a car? That's the one time I needed to do that
[25202.48s -> 25218.29s]  and I didn't do it. I scratched right into the fucking wall. Do it.
[25219.01s -> 25224.80s]  That was a lot. Oh he's gonna fuck himself. He's gonna fuck himself over.
[25238.50s -> 25248.42s]  Look at me. I'm in trouble too. Uh oh. Can I get out of the car? I'm not touching him
[25248.42s -> 25264.83s]  until I find a wrench. I saw one earlier. Wrench wrench wrench. Maybe he'll just blow
[25264.83s -> 25270.46s]  up into a wall. There's a wrench right there. How do I get that? I have to go over like that
[25270.46s -> 25279.28s]  jump. I gotta go over the jump that's over there but I'll lose him won't I? And then the mission
[25279.28s -> 25309.42s]  will be over. Don't touch him. He'll do it himself. Good? Good? Got it.
[25309.42s -> 25332.69s]  Oh that's wayyyy. He's so close. Get it.
[25341.01s -> 25346.88s]  I'm well aware that I just did a full-on pall bearer. I just screamed for Kane.
[25362.82s -> 25373.65s]  Kane! We undertake! All right so did I win? Did I beat the game?
[25374.53s -> 25395.26s]  What in the hell were you thinking? Pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan.
[25396.14s -> 25402.88s]  What? What do you mean? What are you talking about? Oh my fucking god.
[25402.88s -> 25406.16s]  I am a lean mean Vindaloo machine.

[25449.49s -> 25466.46s]  No way. I gotta slow down man. I'm gonna fucking pass out. This has been like a cartoon
[25466.46s -> 25474.88s]  character scream. If you do not tell me who owns the cola trucks then I will be forced to use
[25474.88s -> 25480.40s]  vanity. Okay okay. Calm down dude. No I'm just kidding. The cola trucks are registered to the
[25480.40s -> 25486.08s]  museum. The museum? What? Each level of this adventure is more exciting than the last.
[25487.28s -> 25491.65s]  I feel like a Brahmin. I mean yeah this is a cartoon you're right.
[25492.74s -> 25500.58s]  Dr. Bart. What the hell are you doing here? Well Mr. Bart I have discovered that the evil cola
[25500.58s -> 25506.02s]  is being made in the Springfield museum. But that closes in five minutes. And my car is out of gas.

[25513.86s -> 25517.86s]  Drive to the museum before the curator leaves. Bart Simpson at your service.
[25518.58s -> 25522.10s]  Must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the
[25522.10s -> 25524.58s]  odor of the hot dog machine. G-Money crickets.
[25525.86s -> 25541.28s]  How far from here to go? Ten seconds. Oh it's right there.

[25655.70s -> 25661.92s]  Oh I gotta go to the museum. This is not good for my insurance.

[25700.77s -> 25705.49s]  No and I'm talking about what do I need the money for? In the Simpsons video game.

[26878.30s -> 26883.98s]  cried wolf except instead of a wolf it's an alien conspiracy aliens well that would explain
[26883.98s -> 26889.82s]  these strange transmissions from dollar tree burger i must have intercepted an alien
[26890.86s -> 26897.90s]  it says they're hiding the lasers in the duct trucks the plot is convoluted now relax
[26897.90s -> 26901.10s]  nerdlinger i'll knock the lasers out of the truck so i can show them to crusty
[26903.39s -> 26907.79s]  drive to the brewery and stop the aliens plan to hit the truck and collect the laser guns
[26907.79s -> 26912.75s]  fine by me all right i think we're about we're about to see the final mission of the game
[26912.75s -> 26928.37s]  before homer simpson has like eight more missions guys we'll get these they're right here
[26951.28s -> 26987.92s]  how did i get up here oops park there i'm gonna have to redo it i'm gonna have to redo it

[27341.54s -> 27347.22s]  believe me i can't believe i have a working laser gun and i'm using it for good
[27347.22s -> 27356.10s]  drive to the taffy shop there you got my attention chat helped i probably i would i
[27356.10s -> 27360.83s]  probably would have driven off the cliff speaking of which no don't do that what if it ends in
[27360.83s -> 27381.55s]  this year hit apparently doesn't hit you save game thank you so much for that
[27388.35s -> 27395.44s]  i don't know i've never mind i was wrong i thought i was going to say something that
[27395.44s -> 27411.30s]  made sense but it was not going to make any sense save save save save save i got principal
[27411.30s -> 27420.59s]  skinner principal skinner aliens are distributing deadly lasers all over springfield we gotta warn
[27420.59s -> 27425.39s]  everybody all we've got to do young man is get that illicit goo gaw out of your dream until
[27425.39s -> 27433.07s]  twitch shuts you off at 48 hours policy on lasers uh why would i do that destroy principal
[27433.07s -> 27439.54s]  skinner's car and take back the laser gun before time runs out i'm going to block them
[27439.54s -> 27466.62s]  and push them into the ocean no problemo i need some speed yeah i'll educate you a new one
[27468.80s -> 27471.92s]  odd felt like i did some damage to you but apparently i didn't
[27473.44s -> 27494.08s]  apparently i didn't do any damage to you i just hurt myself you just took a huge hit
[27503.89s -> 27515.58s]  take that lousy laws of physics use a stronger car it's time for some yeah but i mean
[27517.10s -> 27520.78s]  when i string together the mission like this i kind of i guess i could just jump out right
[27520.78s -> 27527.26s]  now i can get it i'll educate you a new one he'll run into a wall in his car and explode
[27528.38s -> 27539.92s]  here it comes look at how fast he's going he can't control it right into this wall straight
[27539.92s -> 27566.90s]  ahead fire in the hole take that no damage on that one bastard almost dead i keep like
[27566.90s -> 27583.62s]  peeling him out when i don't mean to do that convenient just go two miles per hour into me
[27583.62s -> 27598.94s]  see this is where he could have done it i need to slow down and just get right up him
[27599.74s -> 27617.15s]  all right maybe i do need to beg your car just to drive into him because this is not
[27617.15s -> 27629.86s]  working just doesn't do enough damage when you hit him i'll educate you a new one i hope
[27629.86s -> 27632.90s]  that was expensive figured that would have done a lot of damage but apparently not
[27633.86s -> 27642.40s]  i'd have to get like the plow or something okay that's just where the fuck did he my brain
[27643.04s -> 27646.32s]  i thought he drove off the cliff and then oh man
[27646.32s -> 27649.78s]  and
[27662.80s -> 27673.92s]  skinner is dead uh skinner and his mom they were both in the same car so they were together
[27687.30s -> 27708.35s]  shebar the car is on fire i'll pick her up at the moment mother
[27708.43s -> 27714.11s]  well what do you know you were telling the truth you've taught this old clown a lesson
[27714.11s -> 27718.83s]  prepare to be stuck on this level for an hour et cetera et cetera stay in school i just wish
[27718.83s -> 27724.43s]  you told me before i let them set up those free laser gun stands oh man i better get some
[27724.43s -> 27729.23s]  heavy artillery if i'm gonna take out that much private property kurti should have something
[27729.23s -> 27735.25s]  good to complete this mission you'll need the globex super villain car purchase it from
[27736.21s -> 27753.04s]  yeah for 600 coins how many coins do i have now i need more coins 200
[27755.20s -> 27781.22s]  these expensive somebody just said cheat i can't cheat that i gotta play the way the
[27781.22s -> 27786.59s]  game was meant to be played once you cheat you can't go back there's no turning back
[27786.59s -> 27793.87s]  after a cheat all right which way do i want to go let's go this way first
[27802.13s -> 27815.94s]  um so what was the point of that there's nothing up here oh my holy shit that's a lot of money
[27818.00s -> 27852.93s]  wow didn't even need to cheat the code is right in here all right that helps a lot
[27852.93s -> 27866.62s]  any more hidden rooms that have money there's a spot to go over here um i guess i could have
[27866.62s -> 27870.32s]  jumped over the other side i wonder what's over there let me get over there again
[27885.66s -> 27886.78s]  what is it all right cool
[27898.03s -> 27902.75s]  i thought this is gonna take a lot longer thankfully there was this shit over here
[27903.55s -> 27908.51s]  and i got another thing to platform around on which where will this take me over the
[27909.39s -> 27925.73s]  back to the back to where i was hi yeah save again good call you missed a bonfire
[27931.50s -> 27947.73s]  oh box over here i'm gonna guess yes there's quite a lot back here it's
[27947.73s -> 27959.23s]  gonna be done all right did it 500 coins that i wish from software would make a simpson's souls
[27960.67s -> 27963.97s]  look at the amount of characters that are in this universe it'd be great
[27975.10s -> 27996.10s]  more like dumb my 985 get it you know that's the first rock i've seen thrown in
[27997.14s -> 28018.99s]  at least at least probably an hour or two all right i almost got it so i have to go
[28018.99s -> 28021.71s]  buy i guess i can buy it from right there right can i
[28025.23s -> 28031.07s]  i need we need a little bit more money i think that there's probably some over here i can get
[28033.55s -> 28051.81s]  maybe did i miss anything 559 where's this music coming from here the boat
[28052.45s -> 28077.62s]  it's break ship i'm looking around for like a b or a box who well may have found something
[28078.18s -> 28091.42s]  come on over here i just saw it that's very dangerous part you shouldn't be doing that
[28091.42s -> 28107.74s]  okay b you gonna appear no b no box they should make a simpson's tv show
[28108.38s -> 28121.23s]  these are really interesting characters uh is there a box on the boat
[28126.61s -> 28138.34s]  kind of up here for no reason aren't i it's very funny i appreciate that thank you
[28139.06s -> 28144.74s]  i tried as hard as i could i'll never lose these love handles
[28144.74s -> 28169.17s]  okay well i guess there's nothing here to get this much exercise that was a gag well maybe there's a
[28169.17s -> 28214.58s]  bug see a box down here but what about over here there's one down here
[28220.42s -> 28223.94s]  just give me a sec here is the rest of the money that i'll probably need for the rest of
[28223.94s -> 28243.41s]  the game maybe depends on how much longer it is maybe i should stockpile a little bit
[28243.97s -> 28246.45s]  just so i can have it so i don't have to take time out
[28249.65s -> 28253.78s]  because there's another way to go over there let me just check a look back here
[28261.04s -> 28268.45s]  energy depleting need sugar okay out on the lip

[29672.02s -> 29676.34s]  pushed it through you know what i mean did they just run an algorithm that completed the
[29676.34s -> 29684.61s]  level they're like yeah that's good but hey did the bot make it with one second left
[29684.61s -> 29690.88s]  yeah that's fine that's good good shit i love god i love this show
[29704.27s -> 29711.07s]  some of the time that homer got stuck in the dunk tank
[29731.07s -> 29733.39s]  it's all right you get the same amount of time i'm going all right here we go
[29734.27s -> 29747.25s]  we missed the fucking wrench i almost blew it there with that stupid
[29747.25s -> 29757.70s]  rng of when is the thing gonna close i shouldn't enjoy this so much see i tried oh man i
[29757.70s -> 29762.10s]  wanted to go down on the beach but the thing it's just how do you even determine where you're gonna
[29762.10s -> 29778.58s]  end up i'll have to go through the boat too don't i i don't even remember i need to like
[29778.58s -> 29783.54s]  look at where that shortcut is because it's it's it's you have to be perfect and use
[29783.54s -> 29792.45s]  every fucking shortcut to be perfect and use every shortcut where is it well i need to go
[29792.45s -> 29796.21s]  look at it because when you're driving a thousand miles per hour and there's shit
[29796.21s -> 29802.21s]  happening all around you i can't pay attention to all that stuff at the same time like where
[29802.21s -> 29815.54s]  is it i need to go i'm just gonna i need to go look at it because this is this is like
[29816.59s -> 29821.89s]  outrageous even if i fail i just want to see where it is
[29842.27s -> 29849.23s]  i almost had it that other time too but i didn't get screwed over
[29857.23s -> 29860.27s]  don't run people over you know how difficult it is to do that
[29861.55s -> 29878.72s]  and collect everything in one minute and 40 seconds that's almost impossible he's being here
[29878.72s -> 29889.34s]  before oh my why why why god the three dumb motherfucking sedans why are you
[29891.68s -> 29901.20s]  and what and i went over the fuck is that even possible i went over the wrench
[29902.16s -> 29907.44s]  i don't i need to go look at this shit i need to go see oh my god this is unbearable
[29908.56s -> 29915.12s]  no mission in the whole game is compared to how horrible this is
[29915.76s -> 29922.16s]  i don't even care if i lose i'm i need to go look at this where is this shortcut
[29923.04s -> 29929.07s]  where is it this way i can't even see
[29937.65s -> 29950.72s]  no problemo i just can't even understand how do they expect people to reliably do this
[29966.72s -> 29979.46s]  and it only gets worse from here you know i don't give a shit about any of this stuff going on
[29979.46s -> 29983.54s]  right now i'm gonna quit the mission and i'm gonna go find this exact route to take to do
[29983.54s -> 30014.56s]  the job where is it i need to like where where's that like spot so somebody said the
[30014.56s -> 30020.96s]  boat is closed boat is closed so i can't even do it in the so why is everybody screaming at
[30020.96s -> 30028.45s]  me to do this if i can't even do it in the first place is that for real it is for real
[30034.72s -> 30057.92s]  it's not closed no no no no wait wait wait no i need to see how this connects there's the
[30057.92s -> 30066.46s]  jump but where's the direct route from where i come off of not that way so i'm gonna bang
[30067.42s -> 30074.34s]  a left once i get to here or is it a left which what it's this little corner what what
[30074.34s -> 30091.39s]  direction do i come from spray through here and then you bang a right because this starts down
[30091.39s -> 30105.06s]  here around and then once you get to this with uh that dude up here i get it i get it yeah you
[30105.06s -> 30108.82s]  put you put these people in the game because of grand theft auto you thought it would be
[30108.90s -> 30120.22s]  great i need to i need to get out of the car so i can see i'm gonna look up to the phone that's
[30120.22s -> 30136.80s]  where the phone booth is so i gotta take go straight and then bang a right once i get to
[30136.80s -> 30149.28s]  this portion here because i'm gonna be coming from this way right so if i'm gonna be coming
[30149.28s -> 30154.80s]  from this way then it is just straight through where the ketchup guy is right through the boat
[30155.44s -> 30181.89s]  it's a way to go through here too there's a way to go through here so hold on so there's an alley
[30181.89s -> 30203.04s]  right here which goes straight and then you bang a left and then a right germa finding the speed
[30203.04s -> 30216.96s]  run tactic so i'm trying to find the complete the level the base level all right so that's
[30216.96s -> 30222.96s]  where you land this is where you land from the jump forget about the beach so it's just
[30222.96s -> 30230.98s]  right there and here and then here all right i got it
[30243.34s -> 30252.54s]  land right there all right i got it let's fucking go i have to go back to crusty's lab right
[30257.38s -> 30263.50s]  i'm gonna do that i'm gonna smash it right into it test the boat just to make sure oh
[30263.50s -> 30273.65s]  that's a good call i didn't go that fast what do you end up after this
[30277.44s -> 30292.26s]  you end up right here oh that saves a fucking dickload of time all right crusty fuck you
[30300.40s -> 30308.48s]  face me this way how would you die how would you die i'm surprised there's still 3200 people

[32704.10s -> 32711.30s]  sort of tractor beam to suck up trespassers to their doom worst effects ever but that's real
[32711.30s -> 32717.38s]  worst effects ever what's with the cool black car my knowledge of sci-fi movies is correct
[32717.38s -> 32723.22s]  which it is the black car is an advanced probe for the mothership now if you're through i will
[32723.22s -> 32728.02s]  spend my last hours on earth complaining about movies on the internet the gift of life is
[32728.10s -> 32734.58s]  wasted on you yes i recommend you obtain a zombie car it will protect you well more money it runs
[32734.58s -> 32742.66s]  on human brains it's like drawback i get plenty of those you need the zombie car purchased from
[32742.66s -> 32747.70s]  the zombie at the springfield cemetery for 500 coins or call it from a phone booth if you
[32747.70s -> 32756.11s]  already have it i don't think i have that money yet but i can go down the slide and
[32756.11s -> 32762.80s]  maybe collect some cash something i think something's supposed to scare me right there
[32762.80s -> 32794.18s]  there's a spider there well i gotta jump from here 500 i i really okay where do i get some money
[32803.33s -> 32812.14s]  human cookbook can't grab the spider or anything all right look at the boxes
[32816.06s -> 32822.30s]  don't play hit and run at 3am well i'm pretty fair i'm fairly committed so
[32823.26s -> 32827.36s]  i'm gonna get to the end of this tonight this might be like a 12 hour stream
[32827.92s -> 32835.41s]  if it takes that long i'm committed we're already here you know i'm sitting right here
[32847.84s -> 32858.18s]  because i'm so close i'm currently addicted to the game even though it's infuriating
[32862.11s -> 32868.10s]  and i've probably lost two or three hundred hairs just normally because i'm starting to
[32868.10s -> 32872.69s]  lose my hair a little bit but i mean it's been about 12 hours so that's how many hairs i lose
[32872.69s -> 32884.66s]  in about 10 to 12 hours but the game's really frustrating that too anything else over here
[32887.94s -> 32891.22s]  i'm gonna be homer by the end of the stream
[32893.42s -> 32900.90s]  big money on the roof of the school well i just get out of the way i want the coin that's in
[32900.90s -> 32907.31s]  here on the roof of the school and there looks to be a place to go
[32911.68s -> 32917.41s]  whoa can you get up there
[32926.02s -> 32936.50s]  there's no ledge i can stay on here it seems like it should be there try one more time
[32938.34s -> 32940.90s]  i'm storing like a candy wrapper in an upstrap
[32943.23s -> 32949.23s]  that was a little more difficult than it should have been but i made it double jump
[32949.23s -> 32971.41s]  yeah i was trying to i was pressing the input there was one little bit what about up here
[32972.72s -> 32995.28s]  bug no bug there's one something over this way there are a lot of boxes here very good
[32998.78s -> 33001.58s]  yeah i would have just jumped off but i was kind of scared that there was going to be
[33001.58s -> 33022.40s]  nothing underneath me beautiful still not quite there now what do these do can i these blow you
[33023.12s -> 33028.61s]  three i start with me i knew i knew it was going to happen but i just for some reason
[33028.61s -> 33049.28s]  was not expecting it all right a little bit more because i'm drunk i've been i've all i've
[33049.28s -> 33074.32s]  had is i've had a coca cola a ginger ale and water there we go three 393 90 i can't read
[33074.32s -> 33095.62s]  that number 394 but over here something over there i probably can i change music tracks
[33098.27s -> 33111.62s]  this is giving me extra anxiety playing the game all right it's you know what i've been
[33112.42s -> 33116.48s]  i've been on the internet for too long that's a gnome that's what i thought that was
[33117.76s -> 33120.40s]  i thought that was a gnome or something and somebody modded it in
[33121.36s -> 33134.50s]  but online for too long all right this looks like something could be back here
[33138.19s -> 33166.53s]  yes 440 so close can't get over there has germa done anything silly in the last 10 minutes guys
[33167.97s -> 33194.91s]  i don't think so no i don't i don't believe so well i see a lot of shit over there
[33195.71s -> 33219.57s]  what is that thing there's a little go-kart over there that's not gonna knock me into the air

[36687.42s -> 36691.98s]  thousand times join the discord and i was like fine i'm already frustrated and i've all tapped
[36692.38s -> 36696.42s]  and i pressed and now we i don't know when the last time the game was saved
[36716.53s -> 36728.90s]  is the last level was the last one but is there like some kind of magic i can do to bring this
[36728.90s -> 36737.17s]  back do anybody have any ideas some weird pc fucking magic curse shit to bring this back
[36743.30s -> 36752.54s]  cheat okay yeah i'm gonna cheat i'm cheating oh we're cheating absolutely what's the cheat
[36752.62s -> 36775.04s]  code to get the uh to the last level thank you uh cas af for the five community subs
[36775.04s -> 36780.72s]  you can try looking for a save file uh i appreciate the help this is my own fault though
[36782.94s -> 36789.68s]  no don't blame the people in the discord that's my that's my fault for alt tabbing
[36789.68s -> 36801.50s]  and forgetting that that happens all right i'm gonna i'm gonna cheat but i don't it doesn't
[36801.50s -> 36816.64s]  oh okay i'm just gonna do it quick i'm gonna do it nice and quick look at how softly i'm speaking
[36816.64s -> 36860.13s]  now this is like the third time i did this what's wrong with me i had so many opportunities
[36861.31s -> 36869.20s]  to not do that at least i heard people screaming in the discord all right here we go i'm gonna
[36869.20s -> 36874.64s]  punch in the bank you know what i talked a lot of shit about this game it's this game
[36874.64s -> 36894.30s]  from like 2003 so you i can cheat and just get back to where i was that's great this is like
[36894.30s -> 36901.06s]  an athlete taking drugs right before the finish line no it's come on hopefully you can see it
[36901.06s -> 36904.90s]  though i might have to do it again now you got it but good but good but good 20th century
[36907.14s -> 36923.12s]  all right what buttons do i press what's the combo how do i do it simpsons hit and run up
[36923.12s -> 36939.76s]  down left right a b a b start what's wrong can i just skip i think i know i can skip
[36939.76s -> 36956.26s]  the missions i was gonna do right holy shit this is far away all right so i'm just gonna fail and
[36956.26s -> 36974.22s]  skip let's do this thing just look at how long ago this was okay options so he's got options
[36974.22s -> 36991.15s]  f1 right up right up options f1 right up right up what was it that's not real
[36991.15s -> 36999.39s]  oh okay here we go just i'm gonna fuck up and i'm gonna change here we go lose
[37003.36s -> 37007.68s]  you can skip missions but yeah but i have to fail them first what's the fastest way to fail
[37007.68s -> 37019.63s]  the mission it's that black car again it has the speed of a sub-force combined with the
[37019.63s -> 37025.71s]  tenacity of a low off the car yeah this is gonna take a long there's a cheat to unlock
[37025.71s -> 37030.75s]  all the missions it was like that when i got here options f1 f2 f1 f2 up down up down
[37031.23s -> 37039.10s]  i have no endurance wow this car sure can take a beating just get out of the car
[37049.06s -> 37058.80s]  jesus google it i can't google it i can't don't tell me to opt-tab and google this shit
[37068.22s -> 37083.42s]  phone oh i have a telephone okay simpsons i i can't believe i'm doing this
[37084.14s -> 37099.17s]  simpsons hit and run pc cheats all right let's see retry mission like sure cheat codes
[37099.89s -> 37103.97s]  uh that by the way that i was not getting baited in the chat that person was actually
[37103.97s -> 37127.23s]  telling the truth but that doesn't help me that much it's just all characters all vehicles
[37127.87s -> 37133.94s]  different camera angles invincibility higher acceleration that's still gonna oh my god
[37140.24s -> 37141.36s]  main menu options
[37145.22s -> 37157.42s]  i you know the reason why i didn't save is because i think a bunch of i looked over and
[37157.42s -> 37161.58s]  people said that i had a corrupted save file and i just didn't save it i was so
[37162.38s -> 37190.37s]  pick and choose what to believe all right what am i trying oh man i feel so defeated
[37190.37s -> 37196.66s]  i was at the end of the game god damn it i should have just stared at the screen
[37196.66s -> 37212.30s]  i mean so i guess i still so let's see here load game scrapbook options bonus game
[37213.10s -> 37220.91s]  i'm on pc if you fail a mission five times let you skip but i have to fail
[37220.91s -> 37240.45s]  like five missions five times just reset the mission can i i can i just reset the
[37240.45s -> 37247.97s]  mission five does that count i guess it does right see what happens if i do that
[37248.37s -> 37270.11s]  i need to find some new download a save i'm kind of afraid to do that for one reason
[37270.11s -> 37274.59s]  because i feel like it this is like to get the game to even run there's mods and shit to get
[37274.59s -> 37279.65s]  the game to work feel like i can fuck up a lot of shit maybe all right here we go
[37282.69s -> 37283.49s]  let's see if this counts
[37283.49s -> 37308.19s]  it doesn't count
[37312.82s -> 37323.57s]  you must fail it not restart it i was right there why did i not save it i don't know why
[37323.57s -> 37328.85s]  i'm just my brain is so fried i don't know how to cover up people saying corrupt save don't save
[37329.81s -> 37336.21s]  why are you doing why you continuous bro rocks at my house i thought we were over that
[37350.69s -> 37354.61s]  uh i i feel so unfulfilled though i'm so unfulfilled
[37358.85s -> 37361.25s]  what's the fastest way to lose drive into the ocean
[37368.62s -> 37383.71s]  just drive to the just like go to the power plant i guess the start of this mission has
[37383.71s -> 37388.91s]  a 20 second time just exit the car in the beginning of the mission
[37394.69s -> 37397.57s]  it might be faster to just beat the missions
[37403.47s -> 37412.03s]  i was done it was so close oh just wait the 20 seconds
[37417.09s -> 37435.31s]  am i i'm not emulating the game this is uh this is the pc version

[38771.94s -> 38785.90s]  the guy that beats simpson's hit and run on screen is this the last vision this is it this

[39276.32s -> 39292.75s]  to have no sounds though no sounds really does help if you did it once you can do it again
[39292.75s -> 39313.04s]  that's true and i can do it even cleaner this time i'm on life support right now i think
[39313.04s -> 39327.81s]  this is the first time i've ever had a stream longer than 11 hours it has to be simpson's

[40149.60s -> 40152.96s]  but you aren't exploring the maps so you have no idea what shortcuts or routes to take in
[40152.96s -> 40161.95s]  missions you need to explore uh i i stopped halfway through there and really wanted to look
[40161.95s -> 40179.97s]  around for a little bit i stopped caring well okay the last two chapters i would probably
[40179.97s -> 40188.59s]  agree with you that's true because it was getting late and it was getting hard and
[40188.59s -> 40198.53s]  frustrating and i really just wanted to do it and try to get it done but thanks for the tips
