[1.14s -> 18.65s]  Hello. He's early, he's right on time. Welcome back everybody to this community content catch-up stream.
[19.70s -> 29.03s]  And I'm not talking about the red stuff. I still got it after like five days. We have a lot to
[29.03s -> 35.53s]  talk about today and a lot of it is going to be stuff that I don't want to say and it's going
[35.53s -> 41.43s]  to be also stuff that you don't want to hear. So it's going to be great for both of us but both
[41.43s -> 48.33s]  parties are going to be real happy about this. He's retiring and I've decided that that is it.
[49.75s -> 63.66s]  I broke tits too much and I'm done. Over the last week, well five days or four days,
[63.66s -> 72.02s]  whatever you want to call it. I've been having an internal conflict that was constant to decide
[72.02s -> 79.06s]  what I was going to do. I had an appointment with my doctor and people were saying plus two.
[79.06s -> 82.98s]  This is not a joke. Like I'm about to like really drop. I'm about to drop like a fucking
[83.94s -> 87.14s]  you guys not going to be happy. This is not like oh here comes the fucking punch line.
[88.82s -> 93.03s]  Okay I gotta I gotta relax. Here comes the punch line.
[95.90s -> 106.33s]  No comedy. What you're about to hear is what I'm going to call a band-aid rip.
[108.49s -> 111.61s]  It's going to get it's going to get long-winded. So I hope you have time.
[113.11s -> 122.92s]  Uh those of you that don't know over the last couple of years I've had mystery pain
[124.54s -> 131.34s]  that runs down the middle of my chest around to the side and down the sides of my spine.
[132.82s -> 140.04s]  I have been told oh you probably have intercostal nerve damage. Oh you probably have costochondritis.
[140.04s -> 143.56s]  Well you know you might have rheumatoid arthritis. That that test came back positive
[145.45s -> 155.40s]  and I've had to kind of slowly over the last two years try to figure the fuck figure this shit out
[155.96s -> 161.16s]  and find out what the fuck's going on and kind of keep my regular life going too. But I have
[161.16s -> 166.36s]  to be honest with you because I hope I hope I am you know 95 percent of things I say in this
[166.36s -> 173.18s]  channel are lies. So I hope you know that I'm honest with you all the time. I've been operating
[173.18s -> 180.41s]  at probably like a 70 percentile in two years and it became abundantly fucking clear
[182.60s -> 191.22s]  over the last week or two that I have to figure this out and I have to focus on it and I have to
[191.22s -> 198.31s]  make it an immediate concern because after the green screen stream and I talked to my doctor
[198.31s -> 207.80s]  he's just sitting there he was like okay because I was fucking dead bad and we kind of came up with
[207.80s -> 213.26s]  a treatment plan or instead of hey maybe like once every two months you can come in you'll go
[213.26s -> 220.79s]  hey oh we have you scheduled for an MRI. No I'll see you in like a month. I'm gonna take the next
[220.79s -> 228.38s]  like two or three weeks and 100 percent only focus on this with me and my doctor. That means
[228.38s -> 235.10s]  procedures he might want to do tests he might want to do and get actually definitively truly diagnosed
[236.86s -> 241.61s]  but whatever the fuck is going on because you guys don't know
[242.41s -> 248.39s]  I it's just been driving me crazy like I'm gonna just lay it I'm laying it all out in front of you
[249.99s -> 259.59s]  it's been driving me fucking crazy and I don't want it to start negatively affecting the streams
[261.94s -> 271.06s]  when I turn the stream on I have fun and this this stream is seriously like such a positive outlet
[271.06s -> 275.99s]  for me and I'm not talking about like all positivity no no I'm talking about like just
[276.63s -> 281.37s]  I get to come out here and we and fucking have a bunch of fun I have to think about this stupid
[281.37s -> 286.78s]  shit now yeah sometimes it gets in the way because when you have when you have to start to wear a
[286.78s -> 291.98s]  fucking back brace to sit down on a chair I think it's probably time that you like go figure this
[291.98s -> 302.90s]  shit out right and I've been oh maybe I'll stream three four hours a day no I'm just going to take
[302.90s -> 309.46s]  the fucking time and I'm just gonna I'm going off the grid for like two to three weeks and we're
[309.46s -> 314.26s]  just gonna hammer this out and get treated because I haven't been treated for it that's the worst
[314.26s -> 321.45s]  thing I went to physical therapy and the physical therapist told me he looked me right in the eyes
[321.45s -> 327.16s]  and he said I don't think this is gonna work for you I'm just like what the fuck are you talking
[327.16s -> 332.54s]  about he's like well if you have nerve damage or nerve pain if you have like an intercostal nerve
[332.54s -> 344.58s]  problem I can't help you I'm just like oh all right invest in a mecha spine I if I could but
[344.58s -> 351.34s]  it but it's not my spine and that's the problem it's like kind of going back and forth for like
[351.34s -> 358.06s]  years where every couple months I do another test it's like well no you don't have any spinal
[358.06s -> 364.12s]  disc problems okay well you're still fucking everything everything still hurts oh I see you
[364.12s -> 371.14s]  two months I'm not gonna I'm just ripping the band-aid off because I want to just start to
[371.14s -> 375.54s]  figure the fuck this shit out it could be something so easy or it could be something that's very
[375.54s -> 382.63s]  complicated I just need to know and I want to get it done and so does my doctor now here is
[384.47s -> 391.70s]  here is the plan I want it to wait and by the way we're streaming today like I'm not going to
[391.70s -> 395.78s]  turn that I didn't want to talk about I didn't want to do like a hey here I'm going to make a
[395.78s -> 400.34s]  tweet here's like 10 characters describing how I'm not going to be around and my back hurts
[400.90s -> 404.34s]  now I wanted to stream today talk about it today we're going to do community content today
[405.14s -> 414.46s]  there's a lot of stuff to catch up I'm going to hang out we're going to chill but because of my
[414.46s -> 419.06s]  absence that is about to happen this has been something's been worked on for a couple weeks
[420.39s -> 428.17s]  the second channel I'm pleased to announce is bringing on I think four new editors I have
[428.17s -> 434.49s]  brought on a third party to really make that process easier there are now six fucking editors
[434.49s -> 439.45s]  I believe for the second channel the backlog is going to get wiped the fuck out there's going
[439.45s -> 447.69s]  to be a ton of new content probably every single day depending how long it takes I'm not sure how
[447.69s -> 454.81s]  long it will be but we have brought on at least in a temporary sense a bunch of people to help
[456.04s -> 463.14s]  really smash through that content so although you won't be seeing my face on stream over the next
[463.14s -> 471.58s]  two or three weeks you'll the second channel is going to be ripe with fresh fruits I want to make
[471.58s -> 478.22s]  sure that was available and also on top of that there are some much larger projects that have just
[478.22s -> 481.82s]  got barely got off the ground are just starting to happen just starting to be talked about
[483.00s -> 488.68s]  and I want I got I got to get healthy if I want to do the shit that I want to do over the summertime
[488.68s -> 494.60s]  here at the end of like the late summer early fall I got I can't just I gotta get this shit
[494.60s -> 504.58s]  done I gotta just rip the fucking band-aid off let's go in a long time coming so I wanted to
[504.58s -> 510.58s]  tell you I didn't I didn't want to text it to you I wanted to tell it to you behind the computer
[510.58s -> 525.77s]  screen real life house flipper yeah there's a lot that's happening I've talked to my doctor I've
[525.77s -> 530.57s]  talked to my my producer my friend that's really been brought on board to help with a lot of this
[531.88s -> 541.45s]  I want to hit this shit hard and I can't do that right now so I'm gonna just go off the grid for a
[541.45s -> 549.50s]  few weeks this is all I'm gonna focus on and when I come back you I will have been at least told
[549.50s -> 554.22s]  definitively what my real treatment plan is gonna do for whatever this is and like I said it could
[554.22s -> 561.91s]  be so simple it could be so easy like this could go away in a week if I get it figured out but I
[561.91s -> 565.75s]  don't want to have it negatively affect I don't get long-winded here and a lot of money's coming
[565.75s -> 571.50s]  in right now and I want to address it but I also want to address this before I do that that I this
[571.50s -> 577.66s]  is I'm gonna be just fine I've I don't worry about me don't worry about financially don't worry about
[577.66s -> 582.70s]  giving me a bunch of money and shit don't it's not necessary don't do it it's completely unnecessary
[584.73s -> 590.49s]  even though you are a lot of you are it's don't worry about it I'm just fine financially I'm just
[590.49s -> 594.41s]  I'm just fine mentally I'm just I'm just not so quite fine physically
[595.21s -> 616.50s]  right don't worry give him money not so money god damn it no but we're gonna move on I want to
[616.50s -> 625.02s]  take the first like 10 to 20 minutes or so here to really talk about this and I I I don't want
[625.02s -> 629.58s]  this to turn into because this is when I first I hate talking about medical shit I hate talking
[629.58s -> 634.46s]  because then it's just like oh well something's really wrong with him now oh no it's oh I told
[634.46s -> 639.42s]  you guys I told you guys that he's wicked fucked up it's like no I I just wanted to I just gotta
[639.42s -> 645.45s]  get this taken care of I know and it doesn't matter what I say because I know there's gonna
[645.45s -> 651.05s]  be people they're gonna be like well here's what I think it is going by by uh by degree in fucking
[651.05s -> 664.66s]  neuroscience I think he's got three weeks to live I don't worry don't do that like I don't want to
[664.66s -> 670.66s]  see like reddit threads over the next two or three weeks going over like well you know I did notice
[670.66s -> 675.70s]  that he had a little bit of a limp on his right shoulder there in this from two from six or seven
[675.70s -> 683.80s]  months ago I I'm telling you I think I know what it is uh-oh no it's it's completely unnecessary
[684.44s -> 692.50s]  but community content night we got a lot of artwork we've got reddit doctors
[699.03s -> 705.43s]  my I'm on a strict no comedy diet so anytime you hear me laugh it's gonna sound really weird
[706.15s -> 709.59s]  I'm gonna be very very cautious about laughing it's gonna be like
[712.79s -> 717.93s]  I told you I was sitting there I was lying down and I saw and I'll just spoil it because it's
[717.93s -> 726.33s]  fucking hilarious somebody took the dinosaur walking with the Thor's hammer thing and then
[726.33s -> 732.98s]  and they knew how much I love baseball and they made the dinosaur just hit a like a baseball
[733.54s -> 737.96s]  instead that's not what I would and it like came back and hit me in the face
[737.96s -> 743.66s]  it was just I I gotta take a comedy vacation and not even like a medical leave or whatever
[743.66s -> 751.11s]  you want to call it but I know that you guys understand and I don't have to talk about it
[751.11s -> 757.96s]  anymore I just I don't get long-winded on it and I know I take a lot I take breaks on this channel
[759.77s -> 768.04s]  just like last month I was gone for like two weeks I know I don't mean to do that but sometimes
[768.12s -> 771.00s]  they're completely necessary and this is one of those times that I have to do it
[772.04s -> 782.01s]  and that's though that's all I'm gonna say so let's go through how many people have just given

[943.82s -> 949.50s]  a shitload of content bunch of new editors bunch of new stuff I am going to be gone for a little
[949.50s -> 958.44s]  while but I'll be back hey what do you say we do some of the artwork this is community content
[958.44s -> 964.02s]  night and we're gonna go over community content oh by the way a lot of people probably were
[964.98s -> 970.18s]  what's gonna happen with the green screen stuff so instead of just dumping all of this on the end
[970.18s -> 976.30s]  of the another community content night when I come back no there's going to be a another green
[976.30s -> 983.19s]  screen just night where we just do green screen stuff otherwise there's going to be hundreds of
[983.19s -> 990.04s]  videos just dumped right on the end of a community content night so the idea is every time a dlc
[990.04s -> 995.24s]  every time a little green screen dlc pack comes out I don't know why I'm phrasing it that way
[995.24s -> 1000.76s]  but you know what I mean we will do a night where we just do a bunch of them with rules right like
[1000.76s -> 1005.56s]  the last couple times and then that footage is just available for you to put into any community
[1005.56s -> 1015.35s]  content night video right there's gonna be another dlc pack yes yes let me get let me

[1023.46s -> 1032.15s]  and you know what also puts more effort into this and even more brain power into this
[1032.71s -> 1039.10s]  is when I actually do start to see people ask if I'm okay you know because then it gets me
[1039.10s -> 1044.06s]  thinking like is that like people are asking like dude is he all right he kind of like
[1044.70s -> 1051.90s]  I heard he's like in pain hey he doesn't look that good like fuck man like yeah like I got I

[3252.71s -> 3261.54s]  i'm gonna do it the health problems are out of your control yeah but they are though they are
[3261.54s -> 3269.70s]  kind of because i can go take care of this shit like i can go do this i can go get this shit set

[7739.06s -> 7743.30s]  clowns like versus the dinosaurs you know what i mean it's like a baseball game and it's and it's
[7743.30s -> 7752.94s]  just it's just a baseball game and they just play baseball like the clowns like take like rabbits
[7752.94s -> 7758.86s]  out of hats and shouldn't like like before pitches and the dinosaurs like roar and hit home runs
[7758.86s -> 7767.88s]  it's but it's just a regular game of baseball there's nothing there that's wow that's really

[12294.54s -> 12300.70s]  the green screen stuff that i have to get this figured out and i have to whether it's do some
[12300.70s -> 12307.50s]  kind of procedure where i get an injection into a nerve or i can be going back and forth with my
[12307.50s -> 12312.22s]  doctor about some things that we want to try so the next couple of weeks i'm just going to be

[12871.82s -> 12875.90s]  skip skip skip skip skip skip skip skip skip skip that's what we're going to get that's what
[12875.90s -> 12911.69s]  we're going to do five nights at freddy's this is the right video okay it's like 200 people made
[12911.69s -> 12951.16s]  this first thing first one skip wait grab a snack step so we'll make it so 200 different people
[12952.62s -> 12954.94s]  made all of it or just like pieces of it
[12956.06s -> 12967.06s]  so what did each person make a like an image or like a finally the only thing left to be done
[12967.06s -> 12972.26s]  is to capture the essential pieces of data from your counterpart everyone contributed every point
[12973.06s -> 12982.42s]  my hyper metal sonic when you awaken kill him wait that's actually like a marionette
[12983.62s -> 13008.01s]  the remake of the movie i don't think that's true each person made one thing wait it's a this is a
[13008.01s -> 13012.49s]  remake of the original i don't know anything about song the hedgehog all i know is i made that in
[13012.49s -> 13025.27s]  dreams like a year ago that was exactly my inspiration i had nothing to do with this
[13029.30s -> 13041.56s]  very pretty the 90s sonic ova oh see isn't it great the jet propelled bodyboard
[13041.56s -> 13047.11s]  but you want to try it out oh i i get it i get i see what's happening i'll go use it myself
[13047.11s -> 13071.53s]  oh sure i see what i see this is crazy little kid with his new toy so this is the whole movie
[13072.25s -> 13097.43s]  i feel like i'm watching an episode of gumball this is crazy that's the best my favorite one
[13098.46s -> 13111.40s]  that's the best one that one that was perfect i did the same thing with the shrek movie
[13120.66s -> 13130.54s]  are you all right i'm fine just fine so who's that i shot it i have some news for you
[13131.74s -> 13136.46s]  i guess so gee i hope the president and sarah are doing all right
[13154.17s -> 13160.17s]  just give us 100 times i'll stop being your hostage all right started again this is the i
[13161.61s -> 13166.44s]  what the fuck good animation what the fuck good yeah there's 200 there's 200 people that worked on
[13166.44s -> 13189.00s]  this absolutely not you should do this how when i turn a stream on and every three seconds it's
[13189.00s -> 13198.90s]  another artist depiction of the stream
[13198.90s -> 13202.34s]  that'd be pretty funny i think that's just that's the screen for like two hours
[13203.22s -> 13210.10s]  how does the movie end did i even show the ending
[13214.97s -> 13229.42s]  rat movie rebuilt every 10 minutes of a different streamer be you that's so funny
[13230.14s -> 13245.67s]  oh this is pretty sick skip it i told you guys this is like live action sonic better enjoy his
[13245.67s -> 13251.83s]  victory now because once he gets to robotropolis he'll have to fight something far more evil than
[13251.83s -> 13258.95s]  metal robotnik what do you mean are you talking about yourself you better keep your hands off my
[13258.95s -> 13269.75s]  sonic or i'll never forgive you this is with a metal guy oh boy hold on what i was saying was
[13270.47s -> 13274.87s]  i had an idea a long time ago where i was going to pay somebody that looked like me
[13276.18s -> 13284.38s]  that was essentially a doppelganger stream for like two weeks straight and don't ever bring it up
[13284.38s -> 13290.14s]  don't even mention it and i kind of come in sometimes and i sit in behind them in a chair
[13290.14s -> 13295.66s]  for some streams and just teachers aid them you know like put notes down and be like no no no no
[13295.66s -> 13301.86s]  sorry it was look at me you gotta go you gotta do it right like i'm training the next
[13301.86s -> 13311.67s]  germa to take over and they they study the way that i talk and everything that i do
[13312.23s -> 13321.72s]  and they just try so hard to just be me for a week or two straight germa apprentice you have
[13321.72s -> 13328.87s]  like more than one have like five people and then like you get fired them like they they get voted
[13328.87s -> 13340.65s]  off i mean i thought it would be kind of funny to do that at least um but then i just kind of gave
[13340.65s -> 13349.43s]  up on it it's a reality show yeah i mean sure it's on the list of things streamer school
[13350.79s -> 13354.31s]  but it's not like i'm teaching you how to be a streamer i'm teaching you i want you to be
[13354.31s -> 13372.07s]  me i'll explore it a little bit space where they would be blown to pieces this is fucking insane
[13373.19s -> 13393.00s]  gotcha that was close this took so much work wait what's this for me now that looked really good
[13395.14s -> 13397.38s]  ready ready careful fire
[13399.14s -> 13421.34s]  oh that one was made out of paper yes oh this is the best song oh yeah rolling around the speed of
[13421.34s -> 13430.30s]  sound got places to go gonna follow my rainbow already i did this joke already like a year ago
[13430.30s -> 13435.18s]  never mind delete it i did that joke like a year ago i actually did that a year ago and i'm seeing
[13435.18s -> 13451.22s]  it and i'm watching it in my own head it's a joke reuse it is hey grant dufferin i'll give you link
[13451.22s -> 13459.06s]  because that's you're into sonic i admittedly am not very much i think it's a cool character
[13459.06s -> 13463.93s]  i think it's an interesting franchise but i don't i i don't play it i don't really got into it
[13464.73s -> 13482.41s]  enable germa please i will enable germa please i will it's not right now all right guys i i'm

[13510.79s -> 13516.55s]  i've never tried to do like an extended break like this but it has to be done
[13517.51s -> 13522.76s]  it's long term there's a bunch of projects that i'm doing that i want to work on that i want to be
[13522.76s -> 13529.94s]  100 for and that's just all there is to it and it's it's really really difficult for somebody
[13530.90s -> 13535.78s]  like me that has been doing this and been around and cares about doing this shit so much
[13536.66s -> 13541.22s]  to be like i had to buy i'm gone and i don't know when i'm coming back a few weeks it's like
[13543.58s -> 13553.98s]  i hate to do that he's never coming back well that's what that's not true
[13555.18s -> 13561.82s]  not true uh i know it'll be fine and i'm just overthinking it like oh my god they're gonna
[13561.82s -> 13566.22s]  take like what if i'm not back for in like a month what if i have to get a procedure what if i have
[13566.22s -> 13570.70s]  to have like a surgery or something oh no i'm not going to be able to be live for like a month two
[13570.70s -> 13581.61s]  months like shit happens whatever so good i'll tweet more right i'll do more tweets uh just
[13582.65s -> 13589.93s]  it's been a hard call to to make because i knew it was coming eventually tonight we're going to
[13589.93s -> 13595.53s]  do the bits we'll hang up a little bit more uh thanks for watching and i will see you when i
[13595.53s -> 13602.86s]  get back at 100 100 on the 60 70 percent anymore none of them no more of this bullshit
[13604.44s -> 13610.41s]  i will be tweeting don't worry i'm not going to just i'll make it don't worry i'll be around
[13610.41s -> 13624.78s]  and with that i will see you guys in a couple weeks i'm not going to put a time frame on it
[13625.42s -> 13634.70s]  because let's put it this way if this could i could figure this out in the next six or seven days
[13637.13s -> 13645.02s]  or two weeks or more so i would rather just say i'm gonna get this figured out
[13645.66s -> 13649.34s]  if it's less than a week it's less than a week if it's more than two weeks it's more than two
[13649.34s -> 13658.54s]  weeks and i don't know what it's gonna be so he is a different person i'm gonna come i'm gonna
[13658.54s -> 13662.38s]  come back as a different person i hope i come back as a more healthy person that'd be great
[13663.18s -> 13677.98s]  in the meantime i am gonna set up a auto host with just a big bunch of people that i think are
[13677.98s -> 13681.34s]  really really interesting that i think that i respect that i think are funny that i think are
[13681.34s -> 13689.72s]  cool i'm just gonna there'll be an auto host just for the next couple weeks of of my like streamer
[13689.72s -> 13699.46s]  list of people that you know for you to watch if you want to watch them but let's do the bits
[13699.46s -> 13710.86s]  let's go through these don't need to go very very fast but kind of just well we'll hang out
[13710.86s -> 13719.90s]  for a little while ribbiorrhea thanks for the 250 i hope things go well me too i also hope that
[13719.90s -> 13735.80s]  because it is in my best interest to make sure that it happens no more half diagnosis no more
[13735.80s -> 13742.18s]  half well it could be this we'll test you for that oh that looked like it was positive come back
[13742.18s -> 13745.46s]  some other time no no no no we've talked back and forth me and the doctor we're doing it now
[13745.94s -> 13754.42s]  now now now now now everything hey pixel mike thanks for the five dollars here i know full well
[13754.42s -> 13758.10s]  how scary it is for the doctor to flat out tell you i can't help you i've been bouncing around
[13758.10s -> 13762.34s]  doctors for about five years and they still can't really figure it out although i've improved
[13762.34s -> 13765.62s]  incredibly it's still so unnerving not really knowing what's wrong but i think taking three
[13765.62s -> 13775.42s]  weeks of recouping will really help i'm sorry to hear that you're also having bullshit to do
[13775.42s -> 13780.86s]  and when you have some kind of underlying problem and that's the thing i i have a lot of underlying
[13780.86s -> 13787.08s]  problems i've had colitis and i've been diagnosed with with irritable bowel disease
[13787.72s -> 13793.06s]  and i've been treated for that and i remember a time when i wasn't being treated for that
[13793.06s -> 13797.99s]  and it was miserable so i'm kind of putting myself back in that same
[13799.35s -> 13810.01s]  headspace where when i was not getting treated for colitis holy shit hurry the fuck up let's go
[13810.01s -> 13817.02s]  once i started to get on a regimen that is completely under control completely i have not
[13817.02s -> 13825.72s]  had a uh a irritable bowel disease issue i've not had a colitis issue for years since i got on the
[13825.72s -> 13834.39s]  right treatment plan absolutely no problems at all it's it's it's 100 managed so i'm hoping that
[13834.39s -> 13843.64s]  same thing can happen whatever is causing this issue it's just a question of finding it even if
[13843.64s -> 13849.59s]  it's some weird condition that is kind of hard to find i'm gonna find it that's what i'm gonna do
[13853.00s -> 13865.54s]  we'll see what is the issue to not completely broken record myself i have intercostal pain
[13865.54s -> 13873.83s]  nerves that run from my somewhere in the middle of my chest around my band to my back just around
[13873.83s -> 13881.30s]  my ribs hurts all day every day for no reason i didn't get into any accident i didn't have any
[13881.30s -> 13888.65s]  problems it just hurts to move it hurts to sit for a long time and it just hurts to kind of exist
[13888.65s -> 13895.14s]  there's no real cause and it's been the the the bane of my existence for the last probably
[13895.14s -> 13907.00s]  a year and a half it has never gotten better but it's never really gotten any worse so obviously
[13907.00s -> 13919.90s]  i need to figure this out and the latest is and it would make sense but i don't want to
[13919.90s -> 13933.03s]  self-diagnose or anything but this i had what was potentially shingles a few years ago and sometimes
[13933.03s -> 13939.26s]  if you have and remember this is not this is not me telling you this is what it is but this is
[13939.26s -> 13944.33s]  just one of the theories is that if you have shingles and shingles is a rash that goes around
[13944.33s -> 13952.23s]  your it goes down a nerve and there's a small chance if you have shingles that you end up
[13952.23s -> 13970.62s]  with permanent nerve damage it's a neuralgia is what it's called it's rare if it's not that
[13971.00s -> 13981.46s]  i also tested positive for potential rheumatoid arthritis so we're gonna explore that so it's i
[13981.46s -> 13991.05s]  don't know but you can test positive for ra i've been tested for it more than once to make sure
[13991.05s -> 14000.98s]  that we don't get a false positive but it also might just be costochondritis which is just
[14000.98s -> 14005.99s]  inflammation in your rib cage i've been that the doctor said that's probably what it is there's
[14005.99s -> 14011.70s]  been like three or four different opinions on what it could be but it's time to just be like
[14011.70s -> 14020.34s]  which one which one is it which one because if it's something like nerve pain
[14020.34s -> 14027.38s]  or costochondritis i go get a small slightly invasive procedure where they inject a needle
[14027.38s -> 14035.72s]  into my rib and kind of numb with steroids the nerve and they shut it up and then for some people
[14035.72s -> 14044.57s]  you are fucking fine for the rest of your life that has been one of the procedures that i was
[14044.57s -> 14050.31s]  about to do diagnosed you have costochondritis intercostal pain on nerves we're gonna shut the
[14050.31s -> 14058.82s]  nerve down and i said no because i wanted to be definitively diagnosed so i've got a couple more
[14058.82s -> 14066.34s]  opinions on it if it does turn out to be that i'm gonna do it and that will be what i do over the
[14066.34s -> 14083.03s]  next few weeks i'm just gonna get it done but like again i this is why i don't want to to to
[14083.03s -> 14089.06s]  i don't want to tell you guys all this stuff but i kind of have to because you don't just disappear
[14089.06s -> 14097.64s]  for three weeks without me giving you some kind of reasoning oh i have a pain and uh bye see you
[14097.64s -> 14108.95s]  next month no that doesn't work like that you guys you guys kind of need to know he's gonna come back
[14108.95s -> 14125.93s]  as jex yeah i'll i'll be all right it's just something i just don't want to have to deal with
[14125.93s -> 14129.45s]  anymore like like if you were here in the beginning of the stream i'm gonna parrot what i said after
[14129.45s -> 14138.50s]  the green screen dlc it was bad it was bad to a point where i just was kind of looking i was lying
[14138.50s -> 14145.42s]  on my floor just hanging out looking at the ceiling going this has got to stop i gotta get
[14145.42s -> 14152.74s]  this figured out and that's where i kind of had the flow to the ideas around to do it why did you
[14152.74s -> 14159.98s]  break dance because i was having fun i was having too much fun and that's all i cared about and i
[14159.98s -> 14167.10s]  would do it again if i had the chance right now it wasn't that though i did that in the first
[14167.10s -> 14181.35s]  20 minutes of that stream it was just a combination of actively moving around screwing me up because
[14181.99s -> 14186.90s]  there are other times that you guys don't see where i get up and i move around and i feel all
[14186.90s -> 14192.10s]  right but if i you know if i do anything that requires me to rotate it's like oh that fucking
[14192.10s -> 14198.98s]  hurts a lot like i bet well now i'm sore now i'm sore for the rest of the day now why so it's not
[14198.98s -> 14206.15s]  just all i must have done something on that stream this happens on a this is a daily occurrence and
[14206.15s -> 14211.27s]  i don't want to scare anybody i like oh my god monger ash oh shit he's gone what's happening is

[15077.74s -> 15083.61s]  anyone's comfortable giving it's that i want to make sure that you're paying for something
[15083.61s -> 15093.02s]  that's worth paying for it's always been like that so obviously anytime somebody gives a bunch
[15093.02s -> 15099.56s]  of money i don't want to make sure that you're able to do it too you're able to actually give

[16938.34s -> 16944.34s]  need colorist plus music plus composition help but i also realized that i would need to budget
[16944.34s -> 16950.42s]  for the entertainment so here's your payment for entertaining me for the 12 to six hour days
[16950.42s -> 16957.10s]  while i animate my thesis since 2012 helped me make it to the end and now i have a film about

[16972.31s -> 16993.24s]  i'm curious now watch this clip vinnie wants to be friends with germa it'll even fucking load and
[16994.20s -> 17004.66s]  i always get really guilty about that because turn that off where's my audio like i said that
[17004.66s -> 17013.29s]  every other stream there we go and i always get really guilty about that because i like people
[17014.01s -> 17020.76s]  people like germa hey you know like for example i wish i had a better friendship with him
[17021.72s -> 17029.26s]  but i don't put the effort in and um only germa that's it one guy one guy but
[17030.06s -> 17035.43s]  you know and we we all get busy everyone gets busy but the point is like i got to
[17038.58s -> 17050.55s]  yeah i mean that's i feel that it's it's it's really really really easy to just kind of
[17051.59s -> 17058.47s]  just do your own thing and do shit and not really reach out like i do that i do it all the time i
[17058.47s -> 17061.75s]  know a lot of you guys know that i'm like i mostly do i'm a solo guy and i think then he's the same
[17061.75s -> 17067.08s]  way likes to do a lot of his stuff you know solo but you know you you can start to lose track
[17078.66s -> 17084.18s]  i've i've hung up with vinnie in real life he's a really really he's a great fucking person he's
[17084.18s -> 17092.44s]  a really good dude he is like he's exactly like how you think he is you know what i mean just like
[17092.44s -> 17104.10s]  the most chill dude the most like just he's exactly the way that you think he is he is he
[17104.10s -> 17109.16s]  tall than you no i've got at least two or three inches on him he's probably like he's like he's
[17109.16s -> 17124.54s]  like five he's like five eleven i'm like fucking six two you know it is now there's there's tons
[17124.54s -> 17128.22s]  of people that i could say this about you know about hanging out with people reaching out to
[17128.22s -> 17134.54s]  people you know you there's a lot of people that you end up talking to on a weekly daily monthly
[17134.54s -> 17147.66s]  basis i completely get it yearly but that's another thing too that i think a lot of people
[17147.66s -> 17155.22s]  need to understand is um friendships are great and they work very well especially when when
[17155.22s -> 17162.36s]  people don't feel like they're obligated to have to hang out with anybody you know what i mean
[17163.00s -> 17167.64s]  it can make it a little more comfortable when it's not like oh i have to hang out with you
[17167.64s -> 17172.78s]  because i have to but you want you do you want to and you want to spend time with this person
[17172.78s -> 17190.15s]  and you just do here comes the but no that was it that was the statement
[17190.71s -> 17205.21s]  but no i have i have a lot of friends in random various places that i've met over the years and
[17205.21s -> 17208.73s]  years and years some of them you don't talk to very much some of them you do some of them you
[17208.73s -> 17211.69s]  spend a lot of time with some of you don't spend very much time with anymore some of you used to

[17231.22s -> 17237.06s]  at least a dozen people i can think of right now that are maybe not that maybe like six
[17238.54s -> 17246.73s]  that i will never stop talking to for my entire life those long-term just super friends that you
[17246.73s -> 17255.53s]  just talk to almost every day name them most of them are people back in massachusetts they're

[18154.97s -> 18163.66s]  face bernie pog well it was way more than one percent it was about 70 of my power what can i
[18163.66s -> 18171.50s]  do with the extra 30 percent imagine if we could unlock the other 10 if we could unlock even 11
[18171.50s -> 18175.18s]  percent of our brain power like that movie where it happens people could control shit with their
[18175.18s -> 18185.78s]  brains we'll see what i can do hey ryu bait thanks for the hundred bucks hundred dollars for the

[18197.78s -> 18203.18s]  for 250 so i gotta be a little sappy for a bit sorry here it goes having to go back into my
[18203.18s -> 18207.91s]  home situation because of this pandemic nearly sent me back into a real bad depression where
[18207.91s -> 18212.97s]  your streams helped keep me feeling semi okay take as much time as you need we're all rooting
[18212.97s -> 18224.87s]  for you yeah the the pandemic has really fucked up a lot of people's lives put people into
[18224.87s -> 18233.70s]  situations they shouldn't be in taking people out of situations that they really wanted to be in
[18233.70s -> 18249.58s]  is not good but we have some encouraging data that hopefully over these next couple months
[18250.57s -> 18259.45s]  somewhere into july that we can really start to be on the down it's just the downtrend try to go
[18259.45s -> 18280.36s]  back to fucking normal as much as we can i would love to see it because out here in uh in nevada
[18282.17s -> 18288.42s]  the stay at home order is still here and it's gonna stay and we're doing this whole phased
[18288.42s -> 18294.02s]  thing where if a couple weeks go by and there's no spike in cases then we're gonna slowly go
[18294.02s -> 18301.59s]  into another phase but from everything everyone i everything i've read about this this shit's not
[18301.59s -> 18307.80s]  gonna go away it's just here and i don't think we're gonna this is might be a situation where
[18307.80s -> 18313.70s]  this is something that we have to deal with for a long time people say the word second phase but
[18313.70s -> 18320.81s]  i'm not even sure i don't even know if i believe that because i think it's just here and i'm not
[18320.81s -> 18328.52s]  even sure if there's a second phase what about just first phase that never leaves until obviously
[18328.68s -> 18343.96s]  like a vaccine right phase five a second spike is more accurate yeah i'm not a doctor i'm not a
[18343.96s -> 18352.15s]  scientist just kind of we just went that it's out of my it's out of my court for this i'm an e-clown
[18352.15s -> 18356.55s]  that dances to jojo's bizarre adventure i don't know anything about fucking medicine i'm just
[18356.55s -> 18361.35s]  going to listen to the people that do know about medicine and know how to run shit and that's what
[18361.35s -> 18365.11s]  i i just danced at jojo's bizarre adventure in front of a green screen that's what i do
[18365.67s -> 18376.66s]  and let's hope they can figure it out because this is an unprecedented thing and sure there's
[18376.66s -> 18380.26s]  a lot of well we have like we've been we potentially have been running through these
[18380.26s -> 18385.14s]  like simulated pandemics and we have some idea of what might happen and what might not happen
[18385.14s -> 18390.52s]  who fucking knows this is the first time this has really ever caused this much of a problem
[18390.52s -> 18408.30s]  at least in the in the united states can we ban sour please why what about spanish flu
[18409.02s -> 18416.38s]  well when i say that when i'm talking about is like disney world closed for more than a week
[18417.53s -> 18423.72s]  that shit ain't never happened ever uh i know like spanish i'm talking about like in it like
[18423.72s -> 18433.27s]  kind of modern times they didn't have disney world in 1918 yeah well we got it now if they

[18936.17s -> 18942.63s]  my rheumatoid factor was high which apparently can explain a few different conditions that can
[18942.63s -> 18950.01s]  cause that and ra is one of them that was the last thing that happened and the next thing to
[18950.01s -> 18959.21s]  say all right let's get this taken care of let's get this figured out but yeah i looked into i
[18959.21s -> 18965.56s]  looked into like acupuncture and massage therapy i went to physical therapy i was told to physical
[18965.56s -> 18973.99s]  therapy this might not even help so i'm willing to try pretty much anything i will actually write
[18973.99s -> 18986.65s]  that down take a look neurokinetic therapy let's just put it in there cool thanks for the tip

[19260.68s -> 19264.52s]  thing that you just go i can't believe what what the fuck did that person say that's unbelievable
[19265.08s -> 19271.19s]  wait when i was like 17 18 19 i probably would have thought that was funny no i wouldn't have
[19271.19s -> 19279.67s]  not me not me i'm perfect well i'm sure i've everybody grows up everybody you know grows up
[19279.67s -> 19285.11s]  a little bit through the teens into their 20s i like to hope i've become a more mature person
[19285.11s -> 19291.14s]  in the last 20 years but i don't i i do agree with you though i don't think that i've
[19291.86s -> 19297.48s]  i don't think i've changed my approach i think that's still it's that's stayed pretty much the
[19297.48s -> 19314.34s]  same have you tried going 2 000 years into the future in search of a cure two that's a lot um
[19315.74s -> 19322.70s]  how about like 50 100 years 2 000 years i don't know if i want to step out of the time machine
[19323.80s -> 19327.70s]  the ground might be made out of liquid by then i'm not sure i want to do that
[19331.58s -> 19340.04s]  there might be a new animal that has eaten us all well i'm not doing that i'll i'm going tops 10
[19340.04s -> 19346.31s]  years in the future you go 10 years at a time don't go right to 2 000 are you out of your mind
[19346.31s -> 19353.35s]  just go five years take a look around go order a hot dog walk around some streets is it normal
[19353.35s -> 19359.03s]  okay take a look at what what companies have is there any new medical things or any new
[19359.59s -> 19364.15s]  human advancements okay this is pretty normal another five years do it again another five
[19364.15s -> 19368.82s]  once you start to see shit really fucking hit the fan i'm assuming it's probably going to be
[19368.82s -> 19373.94s]  somewhere around the one to two to three hundred year mark what that's when you start to go
[19373.94s -> 19380.62s]  backwards and then start to tell people how they can fix some of those issues like right now like
[19381.50s -> 19389.77s]  now now now no not all right well we don't we don't know that yet you don't know that
[19389.77s -> 19396.52s]  but what they won't listen they will if you can prove to them that you've seen it all you got to
[19396.52s -> 19401.91s]  do is just say like i don't know you could just you could you could prove that you're from the
[19401.91s -> 19411.54s]  future a million ways just find the hot new insane tv show that everybody's watching like a game of

[19438.97s -> 19449.26s]  getting everybody's lines okay then during the airing of the show walk around and just say
[19449.34s -> 19456.63s]  every single line out loud and be like then pointing at yourself like see

[20084.81s -> 20093.80s]  thirst i was thinking about like go listen to fred durst but like i i've listened to fred durst's
[20093.80s -> 20104.28s]  music before the fan of his old songs and and so that wouldn't be accurate anyways i was prescribed
[20104.28s -> 20117.53s]  a uh thing that goes the other way doesn't go down goes up oh yes okay and i did that for a
[20117.53s -> 20123.26s]  while and i was on it for about two or three weeks and it just it absolutely destroyed it
[20124.63s -> 20130.23s]  and sometimes if i have a flare up which happens from time to time i go on a stint of this exact
[20130.23s -> 20137.35s]  medication because where i have all my problems is localized in the lower end of my colon

[20160.39s -> 20166.95s]  eight of them a day and it didn't do anything so we started finally tried to treat from the other
[20166.95s -> 20175.64s]  way and it worked perfectly but also the condition i have might not be in the same spot that you have
[20176.28s -> 20183.48s]  i was able to do it well with the other way because of where it sits the disease in the colon
[20184.12s -> 20192.44s]  so i was fortunate that i was able to do it that way there you go look i'm let i i'm a transparent

[20704.22s -> 20711.38s]  ming dynasty would have no no no no it was when the first prequel movie came out that was the
[20711.38s -> 20723.91s]  biggest event in human history and that was the well that was the only thing that anyone talked
[20723.91s -> 20733.19s]  about that's boomer cringe i know why do you think i'm bringing it up that's unbelievable who cares
[20733.91s -> 20740.25s]  just a bunch of ships shooting at each other in the sky and the lasers with the little little laser

[20780.10s -> 20785.58s]  what would you do in the case of a trolley problem would you let a trolley kill five
[20785.58s -> 20789.90s]  people without interfering or would you change the track to make the choice to kill one person
[20791.93s -> 20801.11s]  um there are no trolleys where i live the statement doesn't make any sense to me
[20801.11s -> 20809.96s]  how big is this trolley is it big enough could i stop it with my bare hands you won't answer it
[20809.96s -> 20819.90s]  would you let the trolley so the trolley is just flying down the trolley track and i can pull a
[20819.90s -> 20831.56s]  lever for the trolley to run a guy over or let the trolley go forward and and and die or something
[20831.56s -> 20838.10s]  um well how can i be certain that i can change this track if i go over there and pull it it's
[20838.10s -> 20843.32s]  too heavy and what if it like snaps and if i what if i do it wrong i don't know how to do it
[20843.32s -> 20853.62s]  you just are i what if i can't do it that's the real question it will kill five if you don't
[20853.62s -> 20860.01s]  switch it okay no i have a solution so i'm in control of the track and i'm pulling the lever
[20860.01s -> 20864.73s]  so what i can do here is the the guy that's standing where the track is going to go i'm
