[0.57s -> 4.73s]  Listen, that's not a defeat for me. Listen, I will be fucking doing cartwheels
[5.61s -> 9.93s]  In my fucking apartment knowing that you're not as smart as me when I do the fucking bomb game with you
[10.57s -> 13.61s]  Listen, you all right. When do you want to do it? When do you want to do it? When do you want to do it?
[14.25s -> 19.42s]  Whenever you're ready. Well, not today. That is but you know next week

[26.18s -> 28.18s]  Not not halo
[30.54s -> 33.10s]  I think i'm never gonna fucking ever play halo because of you
[35.58s -> 37.58s]  I didn't do anything
[40.92s -> 42.84s]  Because of you
[42.84s -> 44.84s]  Oh my god
[45.00s -> 49.08s]  Did I ruin halo for you? I wasn't the one calling me at like 2 a.m. Saying
[50.04s -> 53.35s]  Hey gamer, listen, i've been thinking a lot
[54.23s -> 58.06s]  And you know, it'll be pretty fucking pretty fucking hello gamer
[58.70s -> 64.14s]  Halo legendary and I I told them guys this is this is true fact. This is not me making the whole bullshit up
[64.78s -> 66.38s]  I told germa
[66.38s -> 68.52s]  first of all
[68.52s -> 73.64s]  I don't I don't really play that much halo and you kept lying to me for weeks upon end saying
[74.68s -> 78.36s]  You know back in the day halo was my jam. This is verbatim, by the way
[79.56s -> 81.14s]  germa germa
[81.14s -> 82.84s]  threateningly
[82.84s -> 84.84s]  uh recommended
[85.40s -> 87.48s]  Halo to me
[87.48s -> 88.52s]  and
[88.52s -> 93.32s]  I said maybe maybe and then we get around to doing it and you've been doing nothing but insulting me
[94.12s -> 100.52s]  And saying mean things to me my favorite part of the sir my favorite part about this whole two-hour broadcast so far
[101.40s -> 105.96s]  Absolutely. Is this is may is it gonna make me laugh for the next probably three straight days. Is that
[107.24s -> 110.92s]  That you didn't want to even do like a halo at all
[111.48s -> 117.72s]  And we're like, let's do halo halo legendary and you're just right that you're just sitting there going. I fucking don't want to be here
[120.38s -> 122.22s]  That's so fucking funny
[122.30s -> 125.50s]  Okay, well i'll tell you what i'll tell you the analogy here, right
[125.90s -> 129.18s]  This is a little story. I'm gonna i'm gonna open up a medieval while we talk
[130.22s -> 132.22s]  Okay, imagine
[132.78s -> 135.42s]  Paling around with friends you really like these friends, right?
[136.78s -> 139.50s]  Mm-hmm, and you think they're funny. They're great
[140.30s -> 143.02s]  And then you follow them underneath the bridge
[144.14s -> 146.14s]  And they all pull out syringes
[149.66s -> 151.82s]  They stab themselves in the genitals with syringes
[152.46s -> 153.74s]  and
[153.74s -> 155.42s]  You like these friends
[155.42s -> 156.94s]  But you don't like what they're doing
[156.94s -> 162.22s]  But you you keep going on with it and then you stab yourself with the syringe and you smile through your teeth and say
[162.46s -> 164.46s]  Oh my god. Yeah, I like this
[164.78s -> 170.22s]  And you you and you don't know if they're enjoying it. So you're just kind of going along with it now
[170.86s -> 174.30s]  At this point i'm bleeding out of my cock. So what what what?
[175.82s -> 177.82s]  When what when did I
[178.22s -> 184.31s]  So i'm saying no more halo not tonight maybe at some point next time we're doing this
[185.11s -> 189.11s]  We're not fucking playing a game. We're unfamiliar with and we're not putting it on the hardest difficulty
[193.21s -> 197.05s]  All right, how about how about keep talking and nobody explodes
[197.85s -> 198.81s]  uh
[198.81s -> 200.33s]  next week
[200.33s -> 202.41s]  Yes, I think that sounds like a great idea
[203.51s -> 207.75s]  I i'm quickly learning something. All right, let's see. We don't interact too much on stream
[208.39s -> 210.39s]  We wrestle sometime
[210.39s -> 212.23s]  You know, but
[212.23s -> 217.19s]  I don't think fps games and us. It's like orange juice and toothpaste. We need
[219.40s -> 221.40s]  logical games
[221.98s -> 226.62s]  We need big brain games we need games for big boys. All right
[227.80s -> 229.64s]  Where's my save?
[229.64s -> 231.64s]  We need games like portal
[232.20s -> 233.99s]  math games

[1054.28s -> 1057.72s]  To kick your ass. I'll tell you what though. This this might have been like
[1058.92s -> 1062.04s]  The absolute shittiest slash best stream ever done
[1062.84s -> 1066.76s]  It's like I I don't know what quality is anymore because I don't have any like quality control
[1067.48s -> 1070.23s]  but i'll tell you what like
[1071.50s -> 1074.10s]  I I think this is cock and ball torture
[1074.66s -> 1076.66s]  You know, you know what cock and ball torture is
[1080.06s -> 1082.38s]  Yes
[1082.38s -> 1085.58s]  You know, there's there's an element of like well, yeah, i'm not saying i'm into that stuff
[1085.58s -> 1087.90s]  but i'm saying I relate more to that stuff, you know, because
[1088.70s -> 1090.70s]  Then to halo
[1091.62s -> 1095.62s]  Hold on you relate more to than to halo reach
[1096.18s -> 1101.40s]  I'm just saying that listen the deal is or well, whatever it is
[1102.81s -> 1104.90s]  I hate pain
[1104.90s -> 1108.02s]  But I feel compelled to come back. So who knows?
[1109.42s -> 1112.06s]  Who knows?
[1112.06s -> 1115.18s]  Uh, anyway, I loved it. It was fun
[1115.74s -> 1121.98s]  This this okay in all seriousness not like all shit aside. This was a lot of fun. I think a lot of the uh,
[1122.94s -> 1127.26s]  The fun inadvertently was derived from the fact that
[1128.54s -> 1130.22s]  It was a shit show
[1130.22s -> 1134.06s]  Uh, we came in so underprepared and well
[1135.82s -> 1138.14s]  But how do you come and prepare to like just pull
[1139.02s -> 1140.62s]  halo
[1140.62s -> 1143.18s]  We don't have to like read a bunch of books to play halo
[1144.28s -> 1149.96s]  Well, it took us like three fucking hours to get into the menu and then after we're actually starting streaming then you know, hey, so
[1150.04s -> 1151.54s]  So
[1151.54s -> 1153.56s]  No, it was a pleasure
[1153.56s -> 1155.56s]  We'll see we'll see you next time
[1155.88s -> 1158.92s]  No, no. Yeah for real though, like let's next time
[1159.80s -> 1162.04s]  We'll actually set something up that we both enjoy
[1162.68s -> 1165.24s]  And it's not fucking 4 a.m in the morning
[1166.04s -> 1168.04s]  And it's not me like having
[1168.68s -> 1170.52s]  Having an episode
[1170.52s -> 1171.64s]  All right
[1171.64s -> 1177.88s]  Like I I need an epi pen after this fucking stream like I I feel nauseous in the best way possible like i'm gonna
[1178.84s -> 1183.32s]  I'm gonna vomit my asshole off after this like I need a deep cleansing after the soul here
[1183.64s -> 1185.64s]  but um, regardless, I want to say
[1186.76s -> 1190.44s]  I need to say that uh, this is a this is a lot of fun
[1190.60s -> 1195.64s]  I want to say thank you so much for taking time out of your day to uh ruin your stream. Uh
[1197.24s -> 1200.76s]  And uh, I wish you the best of luck sir with your uh,
[1201.96s -> 1204.20s]  Lack of video gaming skills and uh
[1205.98s -> 1207.98s]  Pompous attitude
[1208.62s -> 1211.37s]  Oh, i'm gonna take the higher road
[1211.45s -> 1213.45s]  Thanks for hanging out
[1214.63s -> 1218.97s]  Thanks for hanging out and spending the time with me together
[1220.70s -> 1222.60s]  and
[1222.60s -> 1224.60s]  I want you to have nightmares tonight
[1225.16s -> 1227.16s]  About chewing on tinfoil
[1227.88s -> 1233.32s]  And that horrible horrible like weird feeling it is I want you to have a never-ending tinfoil chewing dream
[1234.12s -> 1235.96s]  You know what? You know what though?
[1235.96s -> 1237.96s]  I have something worse than that, right?
[1238.76s -> 1241.70s]  I have something worse than that
[1241.70s -> 1243.98s]  tinfoil for me
[1243.98s -> 1245.26s]  it's
[1245.26s -> 1249.50s]  Not that bad. I've heard this analogy before and it hits me going telling stories filling
[1249.90s -> 1253.74s]  You got you got filling. You know, I think it's you know, I think it's actually worse than chewing on
[1254.46s -> 1256.86s]  I don't know if you're gonna relate to this or whatever it is
[1257.58s -> 1259.58s]  But chewing on cotton
[1260.47s -> 1262.15s]  Chewing on what?
[1262.15s -> 1264.71s]  Fuck I haven't saved that. I haven't wait. Wait, hold that thought. I haven't saved
[1266.90s -> 1268.90s]  All right chewing on one

[1272.74s -> 1276.02s]  And then like grinding that stuff in between your teeth
[1276.98s -> 1282.26s]  You guys I feel like I know what you're talking about. I feel like I if you I feel like I could think about what that means

[1547.27s -> 1550.28s]  severely, uh
[1550.30s -> 1552.30s]  scarring the stream with uh
[1553.10s -> 1556.06s]  New low in stream quality, but there was
[1556.70s -> 1561.66s]  Some pooh-pooh talk and stuff that I wasn't a fan of either. I'll just i'll address that with you off stream
[1563.10s -> 1570.06s]  Everything I see
[1570.06s -> 1571.10s]  um

[1589.50s -> 1592.70s]  So we should we should definitely we should definitely cut his mic
[1594.14s -> 1597.98s]  We should definitely uh stream more and I look forward to uh
[1599.26s -> 1602.14s]  Solving brain puzzles next time and that'll be fun
[1603.58s -> 1605.34s]  i'm looking forward to that
[1605.34s -> 1609.66s]  I am I am too, but let's not do it at fucking 4 am because it's it's going to give me
[1610.14s -> 1612.14s]  Fucking nightmares on week 7
[1612.62s -> 1613.42s]  um
[1613.42s -> 1615.18s]  I hope you get a good sleep
[1615.18s -> 1618.94s]  Chad make sure you get put your head on that pillow and rest

[1627.72s -> 1631.56s]  Have a great night, too
[1631.56s -> 1636.33s]  All of you
[1636.33s -> 1639.06s]  Well, this is my cue to leave
[1639.14s -> 1641.22s]  Uh, yeah, it is actually
[1646.62s -> 1648.62s]  You want to pull the plug on ending the call
[1649.26s -> 1652.38s]  Uh, I i'm currently, uh fighting monsters
[1653.10s -> 1655.10s]  Well, if you're a gamer you would have been able to do it
[1655.93s -> 1658.97s]  You've seen a game like this before it takes a lot of focus
[1659.93s -> 1663.98s]  You're playing with four hands
[1663.98s -> 1667.06s]  That would be actually kind of cool
[1667.06s -> 1671.62s]  Does you really make a game like that where you hold down right mouse and it's move fast and then left is
[1672.74s -> 1674.74s]  That's kind of cool. That's not a bad idea
[1675.22s -> 1677.22s]  Jerma, how about this? Tell me a story
[1679.66s -> 1681.66s]  I thought wait, are you still here?
[1681.74s -> 1685.02s]  Jerma you just tell me any story you want and um
[1686.14s -> 1688.23s]  Okay
[1688.23s -> 1690.23s]  Once there was a once there was a boy
[1691.11s -> 1692.07s]  named
[1692.07s -> 1694.07s]  Let's just say his name was dave
[1695.74s -> 1698.73s]  dave
[1698.73s -> 1703.14s]  God, I can't do this while playing this game. It's not gonna happen
[1704.68s -> 1707.08s]  This is two of my hemispheres are fighting each other
[1710.52s -> 1713.02s]  How about this for a story?
[1713.02s -> 1714.92s]  Oh, he's gone. He left
[1714.92s -> 1717.72s]  That's what though. That was what it was. He wanted me to tell a long story
[1717.80s -> 1719.80s]  I'm glad I couldn't come up with anything because he left
[1721.88s -> 1723.16s]  Yeah
[1723.16s -> 1728.04s]  I I know your little game. That's why the story sucked. It wasn't even worth listening to because I didn't even tell anything
[1731.83s -> 1735.67s]  All right. See you later. Joel
[1735.67s -> 1737.67s]  All right. Okay
[1738.78s -> 1742.62s]  Cool. All right. So that was hey, let me change the game name from halo reach
[1746.76s -> 1752.09s]  dude
[1752.09s -> 1754.09s]  The best part about this whole stream
[1754.73s -> 1757.85s]  Is how he was just humoring me playing halo
[1757.85s -> 1761.69s]  He just didn't want to play it and took him two hours to be like I fucking can't do it
[1761.69s -> 1763.69s]  And I don't I don't want to play anymore
[1768.66s -> 1773.38s]  That's the best part, but I ain't going anywhere. I ain't going anywhere. I'm gonna stick around
[1784.89s -> 1786.94s]  We will play something again
[1786.94s -> 1789.51s]  That was a good introduction
[1789.51s -> 1791.74s]  Right. I would say so
[1791.74s -> 1795.10s]  Let me leave the let me leave the squad so we're not squad streaming anymore
[1797.21s -> 1801.05s]  All right, let me I gotta change the people think i'm playing halo reach and they're like, what the fuck are you doing?
[1804.23s -> 1806.87s]  I almost just clicked raid channel and raided shul
[1807.43s -> 1808.95s]  Imagine if I did that
[1808.95s -> 1811.53s]  All right. Let me change uh
[1811.53s -> 1814.15s]  Let me get this on envied evil
[1819.48s -> 1822.60s]  It always ends in viscera cleanup detail, doesn't it?
[1823.56s -> 1825.24s]  I told you hey
[1825.24s -> 1827.56s]  But hold on a second here. This is actually really really interesting
[1829.00s -> 1831.00s]  Didn't I say yesterday?
[1831.08s -> 1836.20s]  Or the day the yeah yesterday. I said a medieval. He's a fucking what the hell is going on
[1836.84s -> 1840.92s]  Jerma's foolish. Holy that scared the fuck out of me. I thought I was not even in a call
[1845.19s -> 1849.43s]  Holy shit, that was terrible. That actually scared me. I thought somebody was like coming to kill me or something
[1849.43s -> 1851.43s]  I thought someone was going to kill me
[1857.66s -> 1859.10s]  Oh my god
[1859.10s -> 1864.09s]  all right, you know when something like that happens and
[1865.02s -> 1870.06s]  That you know that nothing can hurt you but like you're the room you're in just became like
[1870.84s -> 1872.22s]  dangerous
[1872.22s -> 1878.20s]  That's what happened. My room was just dangerous for like a half a second. I was like hands are about to go around my neck
[1878.76s -> 1881.83s]  uh, but I uh, I did say
[1882.15s -> 1883.51s]  that
[1883.51s -> 1886.39s]  Nothing can hurt you. Yeah. I did say that I was never gonna play this again
[1886.71s -> 1889.11s]  I was like, yeah, i'm just gonna say i'm gonna play it i'm never gonna play it and here we are
[1892.31s -> 1894.31s]  Uh, you know, i'm into it for a little bit. I'm into it
[1900.84s -> 1911.75s]  Dragon quest builders that I just hear are very quiet and nothing's going to hurt. No. No, I I made sure I left that call
[1912.71s -> 1914.71s]  Am I gonna do halo again?
[1916.49s -> 1918.49s]  Yeah, you know what? I might just
[1919.05s -> 1921.05s]  I kind of want to play halo
[1922.62s -> 1926.30s]  Like I want to I kind of want to play halo. I might just play it
[1927.42s -> 1929.42s]  And put it on like a like a heart
[1934.33s -> 1942.76s]  What if I went back to halo right now? I feel like that's I feel like I can't do that today
[1943.08s -> 1945.08s]  I feel like I can't do that today
[1945.67s -> 1947.67s]  That's uh, that's like tomorrow
[1952.34s -> 1956.31s]  Do it with somebody else
[1956.39s -> 1958.39s]  Okay. Now that's fucking funny
[1958.47s -> 1962.79s]  Just do it do it just don't tell them don't tell them. Okay
[1963.83s -> 1966.79s]  Whoever is whoever does the halo campaign tomorrow
[1967.43s -> 1971.51s]  Do not tell them that like I got abandoned because they'd uh, no
[1972.95s -> 1981.34s]  It's as if we're starting it over
[1981.42s -> 1983.82s]  It's very important that nobody says anything
[1987.74s -> 1989.74s]  Call me
[1998.22s -> 2000.22s]  Ha ha ha imagine if I get a
[2000.70s -> 2004.38s]  Imagine I get another two hours go by and it's like, ah, I hate this. I have to leave
[2005.42s -> 2007.42s]  And I can never play halo
[2008.68s -> 2010.68s]  Oh, that's fucking funny
[2011.21s -> 2013.21s]  I'll never see the end of halo reach
[2014.15s -> 2018.39s]  Everybody that ever I ever try to play with just humors me for two hours and then doesn't want to play anymore
[2020.50s -> 2022.50s]  That's that's very funny
[2023.62s -> 2026.58s]  We'll see what happens tomorrow. I'll put a few lines out
[2034.04s -> 2036.04s]  That's making me laugh though
[2037.21s -> 2039.21s]  I'll throw a few lines up tomorrow. We'll see
[2046.71s -> 2054.22s]  That's so fucking funny. Yeah, that's me somebody that hasn't played it
[2058.49s -> 2062.49s]  Hey, yeah, I decided to play it. Wait, where are you gonna play? I heard you can play halo reach yesterday
[2064.14s -> 2065.59s]  No
[2065.59s -> 2069.43s]  No, I I decided uh, they were unforeseen circumstance. I know
[2070.39s -> 2074.02s]  And I don't want to tell them anything and I and I really I really think that
[2074.82s -> 2077.38s]  I might get abandoned again, and that's funny
[2078.18s -> 2081.91s]  What if I ask joel to do it again tomorrow?
[2082.79s -> 2090.23s]  Oh fuck i'm dead
[2090.23s -> 2092.70s]  What was the last thing I did?
[2092.70s -> 2094.70s]  I didn't I didn't even save it. Did I? Yeah, I did
[2096.84s -> 2098.44s]  Just play solo
[2098.44s -> 2106.38s]  I can use a better weapon. Give me what's six. I want this thing. Yeah, this is better
[2107.50s -> 2116.76s]  Isn't it great? So I remember keep this in mind. You got to keep this very much in mind
[2117.24s -> 2119.24s]  I have never played halos before
[2119.64s -> 2122.52s]  My first experience that was my actual first halo experience
[2126.98s -> 2131.22s]  That's like going to buy all the best ingredients from the cake store
[2131.86s -> 2133.86s]  You go to the best bakery in the in town
[2136.57s -> 2142.25s]  And then you instead of following the directions on the back of the cake mix thing with all the best ingredients
[2142.73s -> 2144.73s]  You just put it all into a bowl
[2145.21s -> 2146.97s]  Mush it up with your hands
[2146.97s -> 2151.45s]  Taste it say this tastes fucked up and gross and then throw it in the toilet
[2152.41s -> 2165.27s]  That's that's the equivalent
[2165.27s -> 2167.27s]  You're just sitting on the toilet
[2167.27s -> 2177.02s]  Right didn't get him. Oh my god. How can I not hit you?
[2183.98s -> 2186.30s]  Wait, what happened? What do you say? What do you say?
[2188.10s -> 2196.79s]  What do you say?
[2196.79s -> 2199.43s]  Joel's in the chat. He called you a toilet
[2200.15s -> 2204.78s]  What do you mean? He like he called he just called me a toilet
[2206.02s -> 2208.02s]  Or did he call me from the toilet?
[2208.50s -> 2210.50s]  I i'm confused
[2211.06s -> 2218.47s]  I didn't even say fuck
[2218.47s -> 2222.31s]  All right. I gotta focus. I guess this is a hard level hard level focus. Get out the grenade launcher
[2226.31s -> 2228.31s]  Oh, you are the toilet
[2235.91s -> 2237.59s]  All right big room opens
[2237.59s -> 2250.20s]  Got it. Wait, what what is he is he is he?
[2251.91s -> 2254.87s]  Even off even off stream. He's terrorizing my live stream
[2260.15s -> 2270.02s]  Even off even well off camera fuck that shield get down
[2273.82s -> 2277.13s]  I deserved it. I didn't do anything to deserve it
[2279.56s -> 2282.09s]  Let's play halo
[2282.09s -> 2283.77s]  everyone says
[2283.77s -> 2287.37s]  Jeremy you gotta try halo. Oh, it's so fun. What like it's like one of the best
[2288.01s -> 2292.25s]  Games ever this franchise is so good. I just wanted to play halo with a friend
[2298.28s -> 2305.53s]  That's all I wanted and then I was and then I was called names
[2306.71s -> 2312.15s]  two hours
[2312.53s -> 2319.51s]  Nostalgia goggles, but okay that might that might be true. Maybe I don't know but I don't have any of those goggles
[2319.67s -> 2321.91s]  I never I didn't I didn't play it
[2324.15s -> 2326.15s]  I don't own a pair of those goggles
[2330.10s -> 2332.10s]  I'm coming in with a pure
[2333.08s -> 2335.08s]  No bullshit attitude
[2336.23s -> 2340.31s]  No, like oh I did this already and it's that was fun. I know I got it
[2340.95s -> 2345.43s]  They're not the best games ever, but they're great
[2345.91s -> 2347.35s]  Yeah, we'll find out
[2347.35s -> 2348.86s]  when I
[2348.86s -> 2350.86s]  Convince somebody else to play it tomorrow
[2352.06s -> 2354.42s]  And pretend like it's the first time i've done it
[2355.22s -> 2357.22s]  Or no, uh, uh, here's the here's the play
[2359.80s -> 2361.80s]  I just load it from my game
[2362.28s -> 2364.92s]  That I heard and just say that I did a little bit of it off screen
[2365.48s -> 2366.68s]  right
[2366.68s -> 2372.70s]  That makes sense
[2372.70s -> 2378.44s]  He's still in chat
[2378.52s -> 2380.52s]  What do you what do you want from me?
[2384.71s -> 2386.47s]  Haven't you done enough?
[2386.47s -> 2395.85s]  MonkaS
[2395.85s -> 2399.56s]  All right this way this way this way say sorry
[2401.10s -> 2404.46s]  Since when do you have to apologize for things that you aren't real?
[2410.04s -> 2412.04s]  You're a booger streamer
[2413.32s -> 2414.58s]  Hey
[2414.58s -> 2426.57s]  easy
[2426.57s -> 2428.65s]  Wait, they never even played halo
[2430.38s -> 2432.38s]  No, that was halo reach
[2432.78s -> 2435.53s]  first ever experience
[2435.61s -> 2438.33s]  And you know what? I probably wouldn't have it any other way
[2439.05s -> 2444.18s]  All right water release
[2444.18s -> 2447.14s]  Good good good good good over here
[2447.78s -> 2453.54s]  I love the little spots to go in
[2454.68s -> 2455.80s]  this way
[2455.80s -> 2456.68s]  No
[2456.68s -> 2462.25s]  It was just a prank
[2466.63s -> 2469.19s]  I got ah, damn it
[2469.27s -> 2471.96s]  Damn it. I got pranked
[2471.96s -> 2474.44s]  Where's the camera? Where is it? Which one just point? Where's the camera?
[2480.26s -> 2482.82s]  Right there. Okay
[2482.82s -> 2484.82s]  How are you still awake? Holy shit
[2485.54s -> 2495.64s]  You're still awake
[2495.64s -> 2499.05s]  It's late
[2499.05s -> 2501.05s]  Joel is drunk. Wait, Joel was drinking?
[2505.43s -> 2508.95s]  Hold on. I
[2508.95s -> 2512.76s]  Joel was drinking
[2512.76s -> 2515.88s]  I don't play with streamers that drink. This is a i'm a dry channel
[2516.60s -> 2518.60s]  Why wasn't that not told to me before?
[2524.60s -> 2528.76s]  Actually kind of like annoyed by that in a way because why wouldn't somebody tell me?
[2536.34s -> 2538.34s]  Not be like serious like be serious
[2538.82s -> 2543.38s]  Was he actually drinking and and participating in a duo live stream with me?
[2543.94s -> 2554.17s]  I know maybe somebody came over from from Joel's stream, but we don't mess around with that
[2555.29s -> 2559.03s]  Next you'll tell me that he's listens to rock music
[2559.75s -> 2561.35s]  And then okay
[2561.35s -> 2562.79s]  Okay
[2562.79s -> 2584.84s]  I'll believe that when I see it. Bye. All right. Bye
[2586.28s -> 2597.10s]  Is this door open? Wait, don't open yet
[2597.26s -> 2603.80s]  Now he's saying bye, but he's he actually he's not leaving see right now
[2603.80s -> 2606.28s]  he's going to take a shower or going to the bathroom
[2607.16s -> 2613.08s]  And he brought his phone with him into the bathroom and this stream is still on and he's right now going like
[2614.60s -> 2616.36s]  But you'll never know that
[2616.36s -> 2619.51s]  I right now i'm on the floor at max volume
[2620.31s -> 2623.77s]  While he's taking a shower because he doesn't want to miss a second of germa 985
[2624.70s -> 2629.10s]  So he turns the shower on so it's very low pressure and turns the volume up and puts the phone on the ground
[2629.10s -> 2631.98s]  So it reverberates on the ground so you can still hear while you're in the shower
[2649.62s -> 2651.86s]  and then you get pissed off because
[2652.82s -> 2656.36s]  God damn it. I don't I I i'm watching this and
[2657.00s -> 2663.16s]  I'm thinking about just not cleaning myself to continue to watch this thing that i'm watching right now
[2670.63s -> 2674.31s]  And then you go. No, no, no, no, whatever. I'll catch up later and then you you know
[2676.63s -> 2678.07s]  Shower's too loud
[2678.07s -> 2683.13s]  You're gonna do that's why I propose the next big thing
[2684.54s -> 2685.90s]  Is gonna be
[2685.90s -> 2691.02s]  And i'm not talking about this is just for the rich like rich rich rich people. I'm talking about a monitor
[2691.74s -> 2695.34s]  Like that like an ipad style tablet that's in your shower
[2698.01s -> 2700.01s]  That is completely waterproof
[2700.49s -> 2702.49s]  And it's like 60 bucks
[2702.97s -> 2708.34s]  That's the next step
[2708.34s -> 2711.86s]  It exists. Yeah, but was it like a grand or something was it like two grand?
[2712.58s -> 2714.42s]  i'm, not gonna buy that
[2714.42s -> 2717.06s]  I would buy it if it was like 40 bucks
[2721.88s -> 2727.32s]  What's happening what's happening seeing a lot of i'm seeing a lot of laughing faces
[2728.28s -> 2732.06s]  Just put your ipad in a plastic bag
[2733.13s -> 2735.13s]  And what hold it?
[2736.10s -> 2738.82s]  Put your ipad in a plastic bag and hold it with you in the shower
[2739.62s -> 2746.22s]  Yeah, but that's messed up
[2747.00s -> 2749.96s]  Taking a shower with a monitor is normal
[2751.53s -> 2755.21s]  Taking a shower with an ipad in a plastic bag is fucking weird
[2762.10s -> 2764.90s]  No, if you have like i'm talking about if you had like a monitor like just in front of you
[2765.30s -> 2767.62s]  Where you you know, you got like your bar soap is right there
[2768.26s -> 2774.74s]  Next to the bar soap is you know, your hair conditioner your shampoo and then there's just like a seven inch screen
[2774.82s -> 2776.82s]  That's embedded into the wall
[2777.30s -> 2786.54s]  This is a bit. No, I mean I would want that
[2787.18s -> 2790.52s]  I'm getting one
[2790.52s -> 2792.52s]  Oh my god, there's a trap in here
[2794.47s -> 2797.37s]  You have to be rich
[2797.37s -> 2799.13s]  Uh, how do I get this?
[2799.13s -> 2806.17s]  And you didn't think I could do halo on fucking legendary
[2807.05s -> 2821.74s]  You know, I think it's possible
[2821.74s -> 2825.50s]  Hmm. This is me in my true environment
[2826.14s -> 2836.06s]  Look at that one hit
[2836.06s -> 2838.06s]  I used to believe but not anymore
[2845.62s -> 2848.34s]  This is a really good just kind of background game, isn't it?
[2852.25s -> 2854.81s]  The less I think about the game the better I do when I play it
[2855.37s -> 2858.34s]  That's it
[2858.34s -> 2862.98s]  Now I know a lot of people will definitely think that that was on purpose and I don't blame you at all. I really don't
[2863.93s -> 2867.13s]  Because of how perfect was that for me to say that and then fall off the cliff
[2868.01s -> 2870.01s]  I know that everyone thinks that that was on purpose
[2870.33s -> 2873.69s]  so the only way I can avoid from being called up being like a
[2874.09s -> 2876.17s]  Wow, nice like tuber joke you fucking loser
[2876.73s -> 2880.81s]  I'm gonna just say that I did that on purpose because there's no way I could say they didn't
[2881.77s -> 2894.87s]  And I didn't know where to start
[2895.11s -> 2899.98s]  Reverse psychology
[2899.98s -> 2904.46s]  I could prove why it happened, but it won't be enough. It won't be enough
[2906.01s -> 2908.25s]  I would never be able to get away from the sea
[2908.89s -> 2912.01s]  the sea of germa iq span and lul
[2913.21s -> 2915.93s]  It won't ever it'll be there and I will never be able to get away from it
[2935.10s -> 2937.26s]  Joel versus germa doom deathmatch I would win
[2940.42s -> 2942.20s]  I would win. Absolutely
[2942.20s -> 2945.16s]  You guys see I you guess I have experience so far, but
[2945.88s -> 2948.28s]  Do you really think that I I don't think you don't you don't think i'd be able to do that
[2953.30s -> 2955.62s]  Like did you see when I played I played dusk?
[2956.26s -> 2961.22s]  And I played it at the hardest difficulty and I did and I remember people in the chat going like holy fuck man
[2961.22s -> 2963.22s]  Like he actually is pretty good at this shit
[2964.98s -> 2968.66s]  Like usually he falls off the edge and you can laugh but not this time
[2976.06s -> 2981.43s]  Are you an egomaniac?
[2981.43s -> 2982.63s]  I don't think so
[2982.63s -> 2986.14s]  Is this a trap?
[2986.14s -> 2993.70s]  Wait, go down. There it is
[2994.66s -> 2996.90s]  All right. That is the gold key
[2999.14s -> 3001.14s]  bombs even bombs
[3001.30s -> 3007.69s]  Actually, you know what?
[3013.80s -> 3015.82s]  No one said that
[3015.82s -> 3017.10s]  I've
[3017.10s -> 3018.78s]  I have logs
[3018.78s -> 3023.50s]  Of every stream. I have a log of every single thing anyone's ever said here
[3024.46s -> 3026.22s]  if I type in
[3026.22s -> 3028.34s]  the exact quote
[3028.34s -> 3036.74s]  I didn't think he was going to be very good at this game. He actually is doing really well end quote search. Oh
[3038.50s -> 3040.94s]  41 results interesting
[3041.58s -> 3047.26s]  This is the gold door. Oh, wait, wait, wait, save it
[3050.49s -> 3053.11s]  Omega lol results
[3058.31s -> 3060.47s]  Whoa, he just went real fast
[3073.78s -> 3075.78s]  Excuse me. Excuse me
[3076.90s -> 3083.62s]  All right. What's your guys favorite weapon in the medieval?
[3086.20s -> 3088.41s]  Mine's the sideways sword
[3088.41s -> 3090.49s]  Or uh, also known as green door
[3095.93s -> 3097.93s]  Grenade launcher. That's pretty good, too. You're right
[3099.40s -> 3101.48s]  Wish me. Good night. Have a great night
[3102.44s -> 3103.48s]  Good night

[3136.95s -> 3139.90s]  I can't hear you sneezing
[3141.32s -> 3149.56s]  I don't know if you're sneezing or not
[3149.56s -> 3153.08s]  Get up here. Yeah, I opened the green door. So what?
[3153.96s -> 3160.47s]  Where do I go now?
[3160.47s -> 3162.47s]  Just say it every few minutes just in case
[3163.99s -> 3165.99s]  I mean that would probably work but
[3166.07s -> 3170.38s]  Did this open now?
[3170.38s -> 3173.26s]  I think I didn't press a button. I saw one and I didn't press it
[3175.85s -> 3180.01s]  No, it's this way
[3180.57s -> 3182.57s]  Germa am I am you okay?
[3184.87s -> 3186.87s]  Yeah, i'm good. What?
[3192.65s -> 3194.58s]  He's not all right
[3194.58s -> 3196.58s]  That's what he would say if he was not. All right
[3196.74s -> 3209.02s]  Oh shit
[3209.02s -> 3212.54s]  Joel's still watching. Yeah, Joel's phone at this point. He put it in his toilet
[3213.10s -> 3215.58s]  So the reverberations from the bowl in the water
[3216.38s -> 3220.62s]  Fill up the bowl and then it's like a big speaker aiming up like a satellite into the bathroom
[3221.58s -> 3228.31s]  He puts it in a plastic bag though. So it's fine. Don't worry
[3233.46s -> 3243.32s]  Wait, hold on need help
[3246.52s -> 3248.38s]  5g toilet
[3248.38s -> 3254.55s]  I mean you guys laugh, but don't you think the most important place for you to have
[3256.06s -> 3258.38s]  Better wireless coverage is in your bathroom
[3260.78s -> 3264.70s]  I'm going to be completely and totally real with you here. This is this is not made up. This is not a joke
[3266.02s -> 3268.84s]  My cell phone
[3268.84s -> 3272.68s]  Is used I would say me actually taking my phone
[3273.56s -> 3275.56s]  out of my pocket or
[3276.36s -> 3278.36s]  Just looking at my phone screen
[3278.60s -> 3279.72s]  happens
[3279.72s -> 3282.12s]  50 to 60 percent of the time when i'm sitting on the toilet
[3284.23s -> 3285.51s]  That's a fact
[3285.51s -> 3295.64s]  I need silver key
[3295.64s -> 3297.88s]  That's because
[3297.88s -> 3301.16s]  No, no, I just that that's just the only time I use it. That's that's the time where it's like, all right
[3301.80s -> 3303.48s]  What's going on right now?
[3303.48s -> 3305.48s]  I don't have to pay attention to anything
[3305.64s -> 3309.80s]  It's not like i'm doing something that's the time where I have that's my telephone time
[3310.68s -> 3312.84s]  If you've had a conversation with me on the phone
[3313.64s -> 3318.92s]  There is a very large chance that I was sitting on the toilet while I was talking to you
[3321.11s -> 3326.15s]  And then I get a little self-conscious about it because you can hear the echo of you're in a bathroom echo
[3328.74s -> 3332.74s]  And you try to mitigate that a little bit by there's different techniques you can use
[3333.14s -> 3342.95s]  Oh, man, it's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time
[3343.67s -> 3345.67s]  Here we go
[3346.87s -> 3354.73s]  Keep going move move move move move who else you
[3355.85s -> 3358.57s]  Oh, I just fucking yeeted that guy
[3361.16s -> 3363.24s]  In quotes and brackets. He says that to be
[3364.28s -> 3366.28s]  Look like he's part of the younger generation
[3366.68s -> 3387.16s]  Okay, wait, I need that. There it is
[3387.32s -> 3389.75s]  All right back to that little pod
[3392.57s -> 3394.57s]  Well, i'm not allowed to say yeet
[3394.81s -> 3398.90s]  And why is that
[3400.57s -> 3408.01s]  Things I can't say some things I can say
[3413.14s -> 3415.78s]  What does this mean? That means it's like a secret over here, right?
[3425.78s -> 3430.74s]  It means yes
[3430.74s -> 3432.74s]  That's pac-man lol
[3435.58s -> 3437.90s]  You know, what's really weird about the word you just said lol
[3438.78s -> 3440.78s]  If I say lol
[3440.94s -> 3444.38s]  Everybody laughs at me and they go wow. Look at this guy trying to use lol. That's
[3445.42s -> 3448.30s]  That was like the internet slang when I was like younger
[3449.62s -> 3452.18s]  Why am I why can't I say lol
[3452.18s -> 3455.54s]  That's a word that I should I should be able to say that because that's like what we said
[3456.34s -> 3465.05s]  Well, it's old internet slang. Yeah
[3465.29s -> 3468.73s]  It means laugh out loud and if I say laugh out loud people go wow
[3469.45s -> 3474.26s]  He's actually he said lol and then I go. All right. Well, i'll do l u l
[3474.74s -> 3478.66s]  Get away from get away from me in my generation and I go fuck. Okay. Haha
[3479.62s -> 3481.22s]  That's sarcastic
[3481.22s -> 3483.21s]  No, um
[3483.21s -> 3485.21s]  I'm took I thought that was funny
[3488.47s -> 3492.50s]  All right, where's that silver door over here? There are rules
[3496.07s -> 3500.10s]  Who am I talking to?
[3500.10s -> 3502.71s]  um
[3502.71s -> 3503.91s]  Shit, I don't know
[3503.91s -> 3515.38s]  So what did that do?
[3515.38s -> 3517.14s]  Yeah, nobody in particular
[3517.14s -> 3524.15s]  I'm just sort of speaking
[3524.15s -> 3525.75s]  Oh, let me get it
[3525.75s -> 3527.75s]  I missed it. I missed it twice
[3528.07s -> 3532.66s]  I mean that would have been great if I got them all if I bowled it in the right
[3533.70s -> 3536.50s]  Oh, I did it zero secrets. God damn it
[3541.50s -> 3543.34s]  You're talking to yourself
[3543.34s -> 3547.38s]  What's the title of this frame?
[3547.38s -> 3565.02s]  right now
[3565.02s -> 3566.54s]  Oh
[3566.54s -> 3568.54s]  Reach with training wheels on
[3571.11s -> 3573.11s]  You could describe this stream as that
[3576.62s -> 3579.18s]  You could that was what this what that was
[3580.30s -> 3582.38s]  Okay title change the title to
[3584.58s -> 3591.02s]  um
[3591.02s -> 3595.90s]  Should I make the name the title see you tomorrow? That's kind of accurate
[3596.46s -> 3605.02s]  All right. How about um
[3605.02s -> 3607.67s]  play reach
[3607.67s -> 3609.11s]  How about just?
[3609.11s -> 3614.42s]  uh
[3614.42s -> 3618.44s]  hopping around
[3618.44s -> 3620.54s]  with
[3620.54s -> 3624.06s]  My stick no hopping around fps
[3624.78s -> 3626.78s]  fps indie game
[3626.86s -> 3628.86s]  old school style fps indie
[3629.50s -> 3631.74s]  game fps styled
[3631.74s -> 3636.68s]  shooter hard game
[3636.68s -> 3637.96s]  Wapping around
[3637.96s -> 3639.32s]  That's good
[3639.32s -> 3651.51s]  Wapping around is fine. Now. What am I at? All right, let's go
[3658.14s -> 3665.56s]  I like this level. This level's big
[3666.68s -> 3679.85s]  Is it difficulty on here?
[3679.85s -> 3681.13s]  uh
[3681.13s -> 3682.57s]  hard
[3682.57s -> 3686.09s]  Just on hard. I think there's one after it, but I didn't I couldn't find it
[3686.81s -> 3688.94s]  It's legendary
[3688.94s -> 3690.92s]  legendary halo
[3690.92s -> 3699.34s]  It's on baby mode. This one's not on baby mode
[3700.22s -> 3701.82s]  I can assure you
[3701.82s -> 3716.52s]  Prove it. How do I?
[3717.13s -> 3720.23s]  How do I prove that?
[3720.23s -> 3724.31s]  Any news on the king stream? Yes, I do actually do have something to say
[3725.11s -> 3726.85s]  it is on
[3726.85s -> 3729.98s]  schedule
[3729.98s -> 3734.14s]  So there was a thought that maybe it would have to be pushed potentially like a week or so maybe
[3734.78s -> 3736.78s]  But we're still on schedule
[3737.50s -> 3739.66s]  And next week is going to be the real
[3740.62s -> 3743.66s]  testing and setting up the white listing stuff
[3745.26s -> 3749.18s]  It's actually apparently according to what i've been told it's probably gonna be pretty easy to do
[3751.10s -> 3753.69s]  So they're working on it should be good to go
[3754.65s -> 3766.98s]  What do I think will happen?
[3767.06s -> 3770.34s]  uh, I have a few theories on what I think will happen on that stream, but
[3771.14s -> 3774.34s]  let's let them let's let them just let them be out there right just
[3775.70s -> 3780.10s]  I'd rather it happen naturally and occur the way that it was going to occur
[3780.66s -> 3794.76s]  Oh shit
[3794.76s -> 3796.26s]  Open
[3796.26s -> 3798.26s]  Oh, that's it. I need this
[3801.34s -> 3804.47s]  I haven't even used any of this
[3804.55s -> 3806.54s]  once
[3806.54s -> 3809.10s]  This is gonna be a month in the making for a five minute stream
[3810.62s -> 3812.62s]  I don't I don't think so
[3813.35s -> 3815.21s]  I don't think so
[3815.21s -> 3817.21s]  regardless of what happens just
[3818.20s -> 3819.32s]  just know
[3819.32s -> 3821.59s]  is uh
[3821.59s -> 3823.59s]  It don't matter. It'll be fun regardless
[3829.06s -> 3836.79s]  I would use yeah, let's just use it didn't kill him. What that should have killed all three of you
[3839.32s -> 3840.84s]  That's bullshit
[3840.84s -> 3851.96s]  Who's coming who's here?
[3852.60s -> 3860.98s]  How's the server info gonna work?
[3861.62s -> 3864.70s]  um
[3864.70s -> 3868.62s]  Not 100 sure yet and I don't want to give info that's inaccurate so
[3869.82s -> 3874.22s]  Next week around i'd say like six or seven days from right now. I'll have more
[3875.26s -> 3877.26s]  actual concrete information
[3877.26s -> 3880.62s]  So I don't want to be like, oh this is how it's going to work and it's like no that that is not
[3881.10s -> 3882.54s]  How it's going to work?
[3882.54s -> 3883.42s]  so
[3883.42s -> 3886.14s]  I'd rather give you the details when they're actually they actually exist
[3887.26s -> 3892.34s]  You need a king stream explanation. Sure thing
[3893.96s -> 3894.76s]  so
[3894.76s -> 3896.76s]  Uh, it is set for
[3897.32s -> 3899.32s]  December 15th is the first one
[3900.04s -> 3903.32s]  It is this it's going to be a potential series
[3903.96s -> 3905.40s]  where
[3905.40s -> 3907.40s]  the goal is to
[3907.40s -> 3909.40s]  Just exist in a town
[3909.64s -> 3913.80s]  Uh in a 500 to a thousand person minecraft server
[3914.68s -> 3916.76s]  concurrent connections
[3916.76s -> 3922.36s]  and the goal is for me to just exist as the king and for people to be uh loyal subjects
[3923.72s -> 3925.72s]  And if I die then it's over
[3934.47s -> 3935.67s]  so
[3935.67s -> 3938.15s]  And there are things in place that I don't want to talk about
[3939.67s -> 3940.87s]  to
[3940.87s -> 3943.83s]  People think oh wow, you're just gonna die in two minutes
[3944.63s -> 3949.53s]  Not so sure about that
[3949.53s -> 3952.89s]  It's not just i'm gonna turn the server on turn around and run in the direction
[3954.58s -> 3957.44s]  No, i'm gonna have personal bodyguards
[3958.14s -> 3961.59s]  There's gonna be an aging system in the game
[3964.44s -> 3966.52s]  Uh, where's this gold key? Have I not seen it?
[3970.17s -> 3974.81s]  And i'm told all this stuff that's happening is doing very well and it's on point and it's almost ready to go
[3975.61s -> 3979.38s]  How did I miss a key? Where did I miss?
[3979.94s -> 3985.93s]  this way
[3985.93s -> 3991.05s]  How do I open that? How do I get up here?
[3991.53s -> 3994.65s]  I had to have missed something
[3994.65s -> 3996.65s]  Minecraft. Oh this here gone
[3997.75s -> 3999.75s]  Minecraft boomers
[4000.87s -> 4005.51s]  Well, minecraft is the only game where this can probably physically work
[4007.51s -> 4010.47s]  I was looking at a lot of different titles stuff like
[4011.75s -> 4013.75s]  arc and conan exiles
[4015.96s -> 4023.40s]  Minecraft is one of the only games that would probably even have the capability to have more than three four five hundred people
[4024.20s -> 4026.12s]  In the same spot concurrently at the same time
[4028.68s -> 4032.04s]  And this is also the first one the first attempt to do this
[4033.34s -> 4038.62s]  If it works out well, and it's really fun this plans to add a shitload more stuff to it and do it like on a once a
[4038.62s -> 4055.18s]  week basis
[4055.18s -> 4057.18s]  Yeah, this like rust
[4057.24s -> 4058.86s]  gmod
[4058.86s -> 4064.54s]  But minecraft is so easily easily manipulatable with plugins and mods
[4065.50s -> 4068.14s]  That we figured it might be might be the easiest one to start with
[4069.26s -> 4071.26s]  And we're gonna go from there
[4074.01s -> 4082.30s]  Press this button. Yeah, and also everybody also does have minecraft like if
[4082.30s -> 4084.50s]  if
[4084.50s -> 4086.50s]  If you have a computer
[4086.98s -> 4092.18s]  And it's played a video game on it more than once you probably have minecraft on some account somewhere
[4095.69s -> 4098.57s]  It also doesn't take very much to run it. Uh, I need to get up there
[4099.21s -> 4108.31s]  How do I get up there? There's a button. Where's this? Where's the button? There's a button
[4117.96s -> 4120.33s]  Minecraft is very laggy
[4120.41s -> 4122.33s]  Yeah, i've been told
[4122.33s -> 4125.93s]  That there are going to be things to uh help mitigate that
[4127.05s -> 4132.41s]  I've been told there is a bunch of things to selectively render things and free up space
[4133.29s -> 4135.29s]  These these these guys seem to know what they're doing
[4138.63s -> 4139.83s]  We'll see
[4139.83s -> 4141.83s]  Look, it's a big experiment
[4142.07s -> 4144.07s]  But it's one that I I want to try
[4144.31s -> 4146.55s]  I feel like it could be fucking fun and hilarious. No matter what
[4148.20s -> 4153.40s]  He's been told by insider sources. That's correct. Who are these guys? They are minecraft
[4154.28s -> 4155.64s]  server and
[4155.64s -> 4157.64s]  mod plugin developers
[4158.44s -> 4164.86s]  That's what I refer to these guys. All right, let's get in that door
[4173.83s -> 4176.07s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, where did you come from?
[4176.79s -> 4192.28s]  notch cameo
[4195.24s -> 4198.20s]  I'm gonna be surprised if notch didn't remember his minecraft password
[4202.07s -> 4205.59s]  No, no, there's no that's not a thing. Let me quell that
[4210.74s -> 4216.95s]  shit
[4216.95s -> 4225.37s]  I am an account
[4225.37s -> 4228.49s]  What is notch up to these days? Is he making any new games or anything?
[4239.93s -> 4242.81s]  He's living he lives alone in his candy room
[4243.77s -> 4249.54s]  What what do you mean you mean he had like a room willy he had a house willy wonka style made out of candy
[4250.66s -> 4252.66s]  like an edible home
[4262.33s -> 4263.61s]  Probably
[4263.61s -> 4269.43s]  I love that's not real but that answer to that is probably
[4271.22s -> 4287.66s]  Oh man, he took off my fucking head. All right, don't fuck this up
[4288.38s -> 4291.50s]  Give me give me the stick the stick. I want the stick
[4292.38s -> 4293.82s]  Give me the stick
[4293.82s -> 4298.14s]  No, the wrong stick. I don't have any ammo for the stick. That's why all right. I get it. Let's go
[4298.78s -> 4323.34s]  Room in here shit
[4323.42s -> 4324.54s]  two
[4324.54s -> 4325.58s]  Three
[4325.58s -> 4332.81s]  All right. Good. He beat halo. It was really good
[4335.38s -> 4337.38s]  Now I understand what the hype is all about
[4337.62s -> 4347.05s]  This room is moving now
[4347.05s -> 4351.69s]  Oh shit
[4351.69s -> 4353.69s]  Really kind of a short game
[4354.09s -> 4356.52s]  What was that an hour and 40 minutes?
[4358.17s -> 4376.26s]  I was I thought it was gonna be a little longer. Don't worry. We had we had the medieval backup
[4389.16s -> 4390.76s]  What really happened?
[4390.76s -> 4393.90s]  Oh, you may not have been here. Uh, joel hates halo
[4401.11s -> 4410.17s]  Uh
[4410.17s -> 4415.72s]  What really happened? You know any explanation as to what actually happened?
[4416.60s -> 4419.00s]  Can just get muddy to not even being real
[4419.96s -> 4422.06s]  That's the weird part
[4422.06s -> 4427.50s]  Any way to explain why i'm not playing halo reach right now could come off as not even real
[4427.98s -> 4431.18s]  Like oh, that's that's made up joke. That's a joke. Okay, that's funny
[4432.22s -> 4435.80s]  All right, this guy's pissing me off
[4444.25s -> 4446.57s]  Oh this place is stupid. Okay
[4447.53s -> 4457.38s]  Looking for a key
[4457.38s -> 4460.02s]  German turn on warrior mode it improves the game
[4460.90s -> 4463.94s]  What does it do?
[4463.94s -> 4465.94s]  Was it the latency?
[4466.02s -> 4467.69s]  Yeah
[4467.69s -> 4470.73s]  Yeah, do you want the real of the real answer?
[4473.77s -> 4481.61s]  the p2 the p2 pants latency was like a lot and clicking your mouse and firing the weapon happened like
[4482.49s -> 4483.61s]  like
[4483.61s -> 4485.61s]  Probably a half second after you did it
[4488.01s -> 4494.90s]  That's the real answer
[4494.90s -> 4498.34s]  Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, where where where where where?
[4504.65s -> 4505.93s]  Don't die here
[4505.93s -> 4507.13s]  please
[4507.13s -> 4511.83s]  I need that help
[4511.83s -> 4514.23s]  Oh, okay. These jumps are a little tricky
[4515.19s -> 4517.88s]  Didn't make it
[4517.88s -> 4524.15s]  The game has a bug where p2p has a lot of input delay
[4525.11s -> 4526.39s]  Yeah
[4526.39s -> 4528.39s]  So it's probably for the best
[4528.55s -> 4532.57s]  But still but still
[4534.84s -> 4536.92s]  Uh, can I make that jump? Let's find out
[4538.14s -> 4554.06s]  Well, we'll find out in a second
[4554.06s -> 4556.70s]  I didn't even get it. How did I not get it?
[4558.58s -> 4561.54s]  This my body's too big. My body's big enough to
[4573.19s -> 4576.71s]  I gotta make this out of
[4576.71s -> 4578.95s]  I'm gonna die. Just kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me
[4582.79s -> 4585.54s]  Okay, let's do this first
[4585.94s -> 4593.59s]  Where is it right here?
[4593.59s -> 4597.77s]  125 health wow 200 health actually. Holy shit. That was very that was very worth doing
[4598.49s -> 4600.97s]  Very much. So give me my stick
[4612.39s -> 4614.31s]  Bring me um here
[4614.31s -> 4616.71s]  That's the best boss ever in a video game
[4618.20s -> 4619.56s]  It's pretty close
[4619.56s -> 4622.44s]  All right. Now we're gonna do this again
[4630.14s -> 4633.26s]  All roads lead to this over clean up detail
[4635.78s -> 4648.41s]  Not today though. Where is it? Get oh shit
[4651.08s -> 4653.08s]  the original spill joke
[4654.92s -> 4661.38s]  joke
[4661.38s -> 4663.22s]  Where are you? Get up here
[4663.22s -> 4666.58s]  I knew I knew you I both of you I knew you were both coming from here and I still all right
[4666.58s -> 4668.58s]  My hand's getting stuck under my desk
[4687.46s -> 4689.70s]  Somebody knows what I mean by that
[4689.70s -> 4690.90s]  so
[4690.90s -> 4695.62s]  Uh, I have one of those pull out things under the under the desk that you slide in and out
[4696.42s -> 4699.62s]  And sometimes when i'm gaming really hard it pushes back in
[4700.34s -> 4703.78s]  So then I end up when I lift my mouth up it on the top
[4704.50s -> 4707.70s]  You know underneath the desk
[4708.26s -> 4719.26s]  When you're gaming really hard
[4719.26s -> 4721.26s]  Okay, this is gonna be speaking of hard
[4721.66s -> 4725.02s]  This looks like a really shitty room that I wish I had held on to most of my
[4726.62s -> 4728.62s]  Stuff I like to use
[4728.70s -> 4730.86s]  Because there are arrows just flying over here
[4731.82s -> 4733.98s]  Oh, yeah, yeah
[4733.98s -> 4735.42s]  Oh, yeah
[4735.42s -> 4739.26s]  I gotta go right down a little
[4739.26s -> 4753.50s]  Don't block it back at me
[4753.50s -> 4757.18s]  Oh, never mind. I thought these were all enemies aiming fire arrows at me
[4758.23s -> 4770.65s]  I'm good
[4770.65s -> 4773.34s]  Is german like anime?
[4773.34s -> 4777.83s]  Uh, yes once a year look at that fucking kill
[4778.55s -> 4792.39s]  Once a year
[4792.39s -> 4796.71s]  I'm just kind of i'm just i'm chilling right now. This I feel actually I feel pretty good
[4797.59s -> 4801.82s]  You know, you just hit that kind of mode where you just you're just chilling
[4803.27s -> 4810.58s]  My utter and severe and sheer disappointment with playing with Joel is not I feel pretty great right now
[4821.34s -> 4822.38s]  Uh-oh
[4822.38s -> 4828.01s]  What happened?
[4828.01s -> 4839.32s]  All right. Here's what really happened. Oh my god
[4839.96s -> 4849.22s]  You know what? Let's see if we can get it
[4849.22s -> 4863.88s]  You should see my face right now
[4863.88s -> 4865.88s]  What are you doing over there?
[4866.28s -> 4871.24s]  He's face cam face cam tease
[4878.10s -> 4880.44s]  I don't want to pick that up
[4880.44s -> 4883.56s]  Should I though? I mean no, I that's a that's a free refill
[4883.88s -> 4885.88s]  Why would I pick up a free refill right now?
[4887.61s -> 4890.41s]  I don't think I maybe I can't come. I don't know whatever just get it
[4891.53s -> 4893.58s]  What?
[4893.58s -> 4895.58s]  I oh it's a fly. I can fly
[4896.06s -> 4902.14s]  Oh
[4902.14s -> 4905.37s]  I get it. There's a timer on this too
[4911.90s -> 4913.90s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on
[4913.98s -> 4917.43s]  I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it
[4917.99s -> 4919.11s]  It's all right
[4919.11s -> 4930.63s]  Just wait for it to respawn
[4930.63s -> 4933.13s]  Sequence complete. Can I like leave?
[4933.77s -> 4940.25s]  What did that do?
[4940.25s -> 4942.01s]  fizzy lifting drigs
[4942.01s -> 4944.89s]  Well, not quite
[4944.89s -> 4949.64s]  up
[4949.64s -> 4952.58s]  I ran out of gas
[4952.58s -> 4980.66s]  I have like no ammo for anything
[4980.66s -> 4983.00s]  Excuse me
[4983.00s -> 4985.00s]  Oh fuck. I forgot I was floating
[4986.12s -> 4988.92s]  No, no, no, no, no you stop moving you die. Just stop moving you die
[4989.56s -> 4994.73s]  Let me pick up all this shit
[4994.73s -> 5002.02s]  I'll get it back immediately
[5002.26s -> 5008.18s]  I need ammo
[5008.18s -> 5010.18s]  5g wizard wand
[5010.18s -> 5011.70s]  That's the one
[5011.70s -> 5016.82s]  I like this room. I like this room, too
[5017.54s -> 5019.86s]  I like this whole level. That's probably my favorite so far
[5020.66s -> 5023.86s]  There's a lot of verticality
[5024.10s -> 5026.10s]  As they say right
[5036.86s -> 5038.86s]  Bounce it around and then
[5043.21s -> 5045.21s]  They do say that yeah, they do
[5045.85s -> 5055.62s]  I'm giving the wings
[5055.62s -> 5057.62s]  I like you. Hey, thanks
[5058.71s -> 5060.47s]  You're not so bad yourself
[5060.47s -> 5066.18s]  How does that sound?
[5066.18s -> 5068.34s]  Jeremy you have to be funny or your sponsor is watching
[5068.98s -> 5076.47s]  Why would my why would my sponsor want me to be funny?
[5077.98s -> 5082.62s]  Do they they only pay me sponsorship money if they think my stream is funny?
[5087.19s -> 5089.35s]  Imagine the rules imagine what that contract would be
[5091.64s -> 5097.00s]  Yes, uh, the ceo of the company's gonna come into your stream every time you stream and at least once he has to audibly laugh
[5097.00s -> 5098.12s]  In the office
[5098.12s -> 5100.12s]  Or we rip your contract in half
[5106.92s -> 5108.92s]  That's some weirdo billionaire shit
[5109.40s -> 5125.32s]  Hey Jeremy, i'm frank here with
[5125.32s -> 5130.04s]  In warrior mode, you don't keep your weapons on each level and each level has their own weapons
[5133.08s -> 5138.20s]  Oh, I see what you mean. So you don't get to just play with whatever you want. You have to get with what the level gives you
[5138.28s -> 5142.28s]  That's it
[5142.28s -> 5145.21s]  This is a boss
[5145.21s -> 5149.46s]  Has to be right?
[5149.46s -> 5152.79s]  All right, let's go
[5152.79s -> 5158.30s]  Solar saint
[5158.70s -> 5172.36s]  Oh, where's he going pick up everything got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it
[5180.34s -> 5186.31s]  Oh
[5186.31s -> 5188.31s]  Help I have 20 health
[5188.79s -> 5191.70s]  Where's he going?
[5191.70s -> 5215.35s]  Okay, where is he?
[5215.35s -> 5217.35s]  oh, man, that's
[5217.83s -> 5226.73s]  That was really
[5226.73s -> 5228.10s]  That was
[5228.10s -> 5230.10s]  If you touch it, you're dead
[5230.34s -> 5234.62s]  I'm not sure I even like that
[5234.62s -> 5240.62s]  I'm not sure I like that one. Hold on. Let's try this again
[5241.50s -> 5243.50s]  Maybe I should just buy this item
[5248.97s -> 5251.45s]  No, this ain't working. No, that's the right idea
[5252.01s -> 5253.77s]  Uh kill me, please
[5253.77s -> 5262.90s]  What should I use against him?
[5263.30s -> 5267.22s]  I feel like this is probably gonna do the most damage but hold on let me go this way
[5274.17s -> 5276.41s]  Yeah, this is it
[5279.45s -> 5281.45s]  And no explosions to kill me instantly
[5288.68s -> 5305.91s]  Help dude, this is a little quick little head bash. You can't get that close
[5306.63s -> 5321.50s]  When does he do it he's gonna do it now just run in a circle
[5325.72s -> 5327.43s]  Oh
[5327.43s -> 5329.67s]  Oh, fuck. Okay, you gotta back up
[5333.38s -> 5335.38s]  You gotta back up. It's all about backtracking
[5336.02s -> 5342.36s]  Don't run underneath
[5342.36s -> 5352.71s]  Maybe just run by him
[5363.35s -> 5369.18s]  Stop shaking my screen
[5371.82s -> 5380.92s]  My face is itchy. I don't know what to do. Fuck
[5384.33s -> 5388.65s]  Holy fuck he just I can't believe he just timed that perfectly that sucked
[5392.26s -> 5394.66s]  How did he time that how did he time that so well?
[5409.22s -> 5424.50s]  Oh, fuck. I got him. God damn. I collect all the stuff. No, it doesn't matter
[5428.06s -> 5439.70s]  So should I try warrior mode? Should I activate it? Oh, damn it. That boss took me 60 tries
[5443.54s -> 5445.54s]  Hey, thanks for being a quote. I can pull later
[5449.72s -> 5451.72s]  This looks like we have what two or three more areas?
[5454.49s -> 5456.49s]  All right, so warrior mode, huh?
[5457.30s -> 5458.74s]  I'll give it a try
[5458.74s -> 5461.30s]  Warrior mode start each level with only the x
[5464.97s -> 5468.41s]  Oh, you have to in every level you have to pick up the weapons would you look at that?
[5469.53s -> 5471.85s]  All right. Where am I going?
[5471.85s -> 5477.29s]  It gives each level a unique flavor
[5478.25s -> 5481.14s]  I like flavors
[5481.14s -> 5483.14s]  All right. Oh
[5483.14s -> 5485.14s]  Sacred path sounds good to me
[5485.62s -> 5488.09s]  That sounds good to me
[5488.09s -> 5498.86s]  Taste the level journeyman's way
[5499.74s -> 5505.32s]  Oh, okay. And look we get my favorite weapon right off the bat
[5506.28s -> 5510.52s]  It's it's our what a delicious green apple flavor. I'm so happy to have this
[5511.48s -> 5519.02s]  I love that artificial almost poison like taste of green apple artificial flavoring
[5519.98s -> 5530.95s]  The best green apple flavoring is the one that you can taste in your nostrils
[5531.67s -> 5538.95s]  All right, so we're uh, where am I going? Am I gonna die if I go in there?
[5543.64s -> 5549.88s]  The journeyman's way leads to the apostle's shrine. Um, that's cool, man
[5549.88s -> 5552.92s]  But how am I supposed to get over there take the big bridge?
[5561.03s -> 5568.31s]  Uh elevator
[5570.04s -> 5580.28s]  Well, I got another weapon
[5581.11s -> 5585.69s]  Oh wait
[5585.69s -> 5588.09s]  He's not aware. No, I'm not
[5588.98s -> 5591.16s]  Can I kill this thing?
[5594.26s -> 5596.74s]  Shout out to all the weirdos who like fanta green apple
[5600.36s -> 5602.52s]  Yeah, that that does make you a weirdo. Doesn't it?
[5609.86s -> 5612.58s]  Yeah, I that's a weird. That is a weirdo barometer. You're right
[5617.54s -> 5619.64s]  random
[5619.64s -> 5621.64s]  green apple fanta
[5625.93s -> 5630.15s]  Yeah, um
[5630.23s -> 5632.79s]  Green apple fanta. I don't think i've even ever had it before
[5634.57s -> 5636.57s]  But I know it probably tastes
[5637.21s -> 5640.73s]  Like a liquid cold version of a jolly rancher
[5641.61s -> 5643.61s]  the green apple jolly rancher
[5650.97s -> 5655.53s]  You know that exact flavor i'm talking about but I feel like it's thick and syrupy and shit and I wouldn't want it in my mouth
[5656.25s -> 5660.28s]  Gotta find a gold key
[5660.44s -> 5670.04s]  What do we open? What do we open here? Ooh?
[5670.76s -> 5675.43s]  There's a timer. There's a timer on this
[5678.73s -> 5680.17s]  gold door
[5680.17s -> 5683.62s]  Where do I go from here?
[5688.10s -> 5690.73s]  No, there's no timer on this
[5690.73s -> 5694.58s]  Fanta is exotic
[5694.58s -> 5697.54s]  Uh, I don't know about Fanta exotic
[5698.26s -> 5702.10s]  Right. I want to get that right here
[5703.66s -> 5705.82s]  I missed it. It's like I was trying to go around it
[5706.54s -> 5713.19s]  All right. So where the fuck do I go?
[5713.35s -> 5726.70s]  Am I there? I guess I could go up here. This is where I came from. I think I go
[5729.78s -> 5734.10s]  Where no this way no
[5735.06s -> 5738.31s]  No, no
[5738.31s -> 5750.25s]  I don't want this way. And this is this out the back entrance
[5754.33s -> 5755.45s]  Wait
[5755.45s -> 5758.81s]  I can go up here. Did that move the shit around on the sides? I think it did. Yeah, it did how do
[5760.54s -> 5762.54s]  Yeah, I moved a bunch of shit all over the place
[5762.78s -> 5769.74s]  We're good. This is the second bonus stream
[5772.82s -> 5776.98s]  Uh, it kind of feels like this whole week so far has been uh
[5777.94s -> 5779.94s]  Just wait bonus stream
[5780.50s -> 5783.32s]  That's been the first couple streams this week
[5783.96s -> 5792.63s]  What is that noise?
[5792.63s -> 5795.58s]  This is not a cannon week
[5795.58s -> 5797.98s]  No, this is week. This week is not you're right. It's not canon
[5800.18s -> 5802.82s]  Well, I mean, you know you yeah you could yeah, you know, it was it was
[5803.46s -> 5807.56s]  We played we played with joel today
[5808.20s -> 5812.42s]  And he was very very angry
[5815.00s -> 5817.00s]  Those who are lost never look upwards
[5819.08s -> 5821.08s]  Except for you because you're playing the game
[5821.48s -> 5828.65s]  That hurts
[5828.65s -> 5830.65s]  We heard joel scream today
[5831.37s -> 5852.06s]  screaming
[5852.06s -> 5854.70s]  So we oh, I don't really like this weapon
[5855.94s -> 5859.85s]  I don't like this flavor
[5859.85s -> 5861.85s]  See that if this thing is um
[5862.73s -> 5864.73s]  If this is like a green apple
[5865.75s -> 5868.39s]  This is like a crystal like rock candy
[5869.59s -> 5871.59s]  Crystal rock candy green apple
[5872.62s -> 5874.70s]  this thing
[5874.70s -> 5879.26s]  It's just like that sour paste like blue raspberry sour gel that you suck on
[5879.74s -> 5883.83s]  This stuff is gross
[5883.83s -> 5885.51s]  I would eat this
[5885.51s -> 5887.98s]  If it came down to whatever
[5887.98s -> 5893.05s]  I can't press this button
[5893.05s -> 5895.77s]  Blue raspberry is the best. Yeah, but not once that like gross gel
[5897.05s -> 5898.01s]  like
[5898.01s -> 5900.01s]  Oil that they put sugar in
[5900.81s -> 5905.03s]  And whip it up
[5905.03s -> 5907.03s]  It like uses cartilage or whatever the hell it is
[5907.59s -> 5911.50s]  Can I get up there? Oh, there's the key shit
[5912.22s -> 5920.87s]  Nothing to do. I can't get up there. This looks breakable. Can I blow this up?
[5922.84s -> 5924.84s]  That looks so breakable though, doesn't it?
[5925.16s -> 5929.38s]  What are my thoughts on sour candy?
[5929.70s -> 5932.44s]  I'm not a big fan of it
[5932.44s -> 5934.57s]  it's
[5934.57s -> 5945.98s]  I gotta undo that
[5945.98s -> 5948.34s]  Because sour is cool
[5948.34s -> 5950.34s]  But after you eat sour candy
[5951.96s -> 5953.16s]  you don't
[5953.16s -> 5955.16s]  You kind of just feel bad
[5955.48s -> 5956.92s]  for
[5956.92s -> 5958.92s]  Like at least 10 20 minutes after you eat it
[5961.43s -> 5963.43s]  Just something something feels off
[5970.44s -> 5972.62s]  The sides of my tongue
[5972.70s -> 5977.58s]  Underneath my tongue at the base of kind of where my jaw is connecting my tongue to my in my mouth
[5978.38s -> 5981.02s]  Is sore like I did a workout inside of my mouth
[5983.45s -> 5986.57s]  If I eat a really sour shit for more than a few minutes straight
[5995.14s -> 5997.14s]  Holy fuck this level is confusing
[5999.11s -> 6000.31s]  Uh
[6000.31s -> 6003.32s]  I think can I jump from
[6006.07s -> 6008.07s]  This is in here
[6008.07s -> 6010.07s]  Then we go we just keep going up
[6013.48s -> 6018.12s]  Don't kill me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no stuck in the wall stuck stuck stuck stuck
[6019.16s -> 6037.24s]  Well, there's health here good. Of course you did that you fucking idiot
[6038.26s -> 6040.26s]  I don't even remember how to get up there load game
[6057.61s -> 6060.57s]  All right. Where's this person invisible? Where are you?
[6062.28s -> 6065.16s]  Oh fucking stupid fucking dumb idiot fucking idiot fucking dumb idiot
[6065.96s -> 6074.62s]  Now what did that do? The protectors cannot stand weapons of chaos
[6076.74s -> 6085.77s]  They can't stand it
[6085.77s -> 6093.30s]  Can't can't get them
[6093.30s -> 6097.46s]  Now what?
[6097.46s -> 6099.46s]  This is one of those puzzle levels, ain't it?
[6102.84s -> 6105.56s]  Well people spawned down here. So I think that's where I need to go
[6106.60s -> 6117.40s]  Right now what what did that button activate? Not bad
[6118.20s -> 6125.37s]  Did something else open down here?
[6127.54s -> 6131.96s]  Oh, here we go
[6131.96s -> 6135.72s]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to get up there. No, I don't that gold key got it
[6141.32s -> 6143.00s]  Holy shit
[6143.00s -> 6149.06s]  That's a lot of people the line streamer misses button

[6356.14s -> 6358.14s]  What the fuck was that?
[6362.63s -> 6365.27s]  It's just super concentrated damage. Can I walk on this floor?
[6366.07s -> 6368.23s]  Can I?
[6368.23s -> 6372.68s]  Nope, I mean I can but not for very long

[6478.74s -> 6481.11s]  You're doing that thing
[6481.27s -> 6483.27s]  Now I know i'm aware now
[6492.86s -> 6494.86s]  Silver key, there's the silver door
[6495.74s -> 6499.83s]  But wait
[6499.83s -> 6502.15s]  Fire makes the vine creature stronger
[6502.79s -> 6505.22s]  So don't use fire use electricity
[6507.22s -> 6509.22s]  The way is clear yet murky
[6509.62s -> 6518.98s]  All right. Uh, anyone know what that is?
[6519.62s -> 6523.51s]  That's out in the main hall and it's connected over there and I don't know. I'll find it
[6530.95s -> 6536.81s]  Oh shit
[6536.81s -> 6538.81s]  Auto flame
[6543.34s -> 6546.30s]  Yes auto flame
[6546.30s -> 6548.14s]  Oh, I wanted to ask a question
[6548.14s -> 6550.82s]  Does anybody have any experience?
[6551.43s -> 6552.84s]  with
[6552.84s -> 6554.02s]  dog
[6554.02s -> 6556.02s]  Ancestry dna kits
[6557.11s -> 6558.55s]  Are they real?
[6558.55s -> 6576.44s]  Or is it just pretend?
[6576.44s -> 6578.20s]  Sounds like bullshit
[6578.20s -> 6580.52s]  My co-worker used them and talked about it for months
[6581.40s -> 6582.68s]  No one knows
[6582.68s -> 6588.04s]  Human ancestry kits aren't real. No, I think if i'm dog ancestry kits, i'm by the way
[6589.40s -> 6591.40s]  I don't see the appeal
[6592.71s -> 6595.40s]  I don't for me
[6595.48s -> 6597.48s]  I don't want to send in
[6597.88s -> 6601.00s]  My like saliva or my blood to some company
[6601.96s -> 6604.92s]  And then they have a genetic dna profile
[6605.64s -> 6607.64s]  They have my genetic code
[6608.52s -> 6612.92s]  Well, why are they collecting this info? What are they doing with it? What are you doing with my info?
[6613.56s -> 6623.16s]  Twitch has that already
[6623.16s -> 6626.68s]  You think the twitch has my genetic dna makeup?
[6633.61s -> 6635.61s]  What what do you mean?
[6638.34s -> 6640.58s]  You can request the destruction of dna
[6641.22s -> 6648.10s]  The path before you must be you must descend
[6648.90s -> 6651.27s]  Oh fuck
[6651.27s -> 6653.43s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, i'm fine
[6662.95s -> 6664.95s]  White fire makes the foes stronger
[6679.86s -> 6690.94s]  Munkah
[6690.94s -> 6693.42s]  Should I have my own munkah s emote?
[6694.06s -> 6711.91s]  Would you guys use it if it was called germa s?
[6712.55s -> 6722.49s]  There we go
[6722.49s -> 6736.76s]  All the way up. You already have one and nobody uses it. Yeah, because the emote doesn't look bright. It's like tiny
[6737.16s -> 6739.16s]  It looks strange
[6739.64s -> 6746.94s]  Plus there's a close-up of it already. That's another emote
[6752.06s -> 6754.38s]  That that fear emote and mars
[6755.83s -> 6757.83s]  They're more surprised than they are scared
[6758.71s -> 6765.18s]  That's a disaster
[6765.18s -> 6777.93s]  Wait, I have to press that button. What hold on? Oh god. Dammit
[6779.29s -> 6787.19s]  You die
[6787.19s -> 6788.63s]  the heck
[6788.63s -> 6790.87s]  All right. This is a fail safe good
[6792.31s -> 6799.78s]  I thought it was a
[6800.38s -> 6804.30s]  I thought it was a straight run. I didn't I think it's I didn't see that there was no ground
[6809.69s -> 6811.69s]  Okay, I was blending it

[6845.26s -> 6847.75s]  I need health. Give me please
[6852.84s -> 6855.80s]  I am in a lot of trouble if I don't get any health right now
[6861.48s -> 6864.42s]  shit

[6932.12s -> 6933.80s]  All right explosives
[6933.80s -> 6941.93s]  Did he just kill himself?
[6941.93s -> 6944.04s]  I think he just killed himself
[6944.04s -> 6946.84s]  He did a huge wind-up and just instantly died
[6949.48s -> 6952.44s]  I think he threw that into the wall and fucking killed him

[7568.23s -> 7570.23s]  That's the first thing that I should say
[7570.63s -> 7574.17s]  What do you think?
[7574.17s -> 7577.85s]  Well, what do you think is like a good approach? What should I say turn the face cam on immediately?
[7586.47s -> 7588.94s]  Can you imagine?
[7588.94s -> 7592.62s]  If I didn't have a face cam on all of a sudden a raid came in a bunch of people came in like some of you
[7592.62s -> 7596.22s]  Guys that came over and I immediately just turned on the face cam. I'm like, hey, hey
[7596.94s -> 7599.42s]  I just pretended like it was on the whole time. That's just
[7600.38s -> 7610.79s]  Huh? Yeah, those for those of you that don't know this is a I don't do face cam on this stream
[7611.75s -> 7613.75s]  Unless it's my birthday
[7613.91s -> 7615.91s]  We do a face cam birthday stream every year
[7617.03s -> 7619.03s]  And that stream is 24 hours
[7619.27s -> 7622.76s]  I do a 24 hour birthday face cam stream
[7623.72s -> 7626.60s]  And I read letters that people send me
[7627.00s -> 7633.30s]  I get a stack of them. I gotta get up there
[7634.02s -> 7640.30s]  You can't even stream for six
[7640.54s -> 7643.94s]  I like the I like that person to check take a look at the data
[7644.90s -> 7648.02s]  My average stream time is between the six and a half to seven and a half hours
[7648.02s -> 7650.58s]  I'd like them to check the data. You could just check on that data
[7651.46s -> 7661.02s]  Should I go back down?
[7661.02s -> 7672.70s]  Wait a minute
[7672.78s -> 7680.09s]  Ah, there's a button over here, right?
[7680.09s -> 7687.08s]  But what does this do for me? I went up this elevator already
[7688.52s -> 7691.56s]  The visage of fire not is not to be trifled with
[7692.36s -> 7702.34s]  What does that do for me? I don't know any idiots here that can help me
[7714.47s -> 7716.47s]  Did I what remind me did I pick up a key?
[7717.11s -> 7727.86s]  All right. Well, at least I got that
[7727.86s -> 7729.86s]  Is there a way I can check my keys?
[7729.86s -> 7734.55s]  Is it the silver key? Maybe I just don't remember
[7736.49s -> 7738.49s]  There are no idiots here. I know
[7738.57s -> 7742.33s]  Sucks sometimes man. I just wish there was like stupid people here besides me
[7742.97s -> 7745.35s]  It sucks
[7745.35s -> 7747.11s]  silver key
[7747.11s -> 7749.61s]  Go back in the hole
[7749.61s -> 7763.34s]  I could go this way
[7763.34s -> 7765.10s]  Show the slap clip
[7765.10s -> 7767.10s]  I'm surprised you guys weren't quicker on that one
[7769.43s -> 7771.43s]  That's usually the first thing that happens
[7778.17s -> 7780.33s]  Finally my favorite item. Yes
[7786.06s -> 7788.06s]  They spammed us like 30 times did they?
[7788.46s -> 7793.42s]  Oh shit, that's what I get for not paying attention anything fish in here
[7797.67s -> 7799.67s]  I haven't saved in a long time
[7814.78s -> 7817.11s]  No, don't touch that
[7817.11s -> 7818.55s]  All right. So this is
[7818.55s -> 7823.11s]  Probably get the person. Ah, there's the key right there. Damn it. All right. How do I open that?
[7825.50s -> 7827.34s]  Can I swim up maybe?
[7827.34s -> 7829.34s]  Well, i've just I got it. Whatever
[7830.14s -> 7835.83s]  There we go. But what about down here?
[7835.83s -> 7839.02s]  This is light coming from
[7839.34s -> 7843.37s]  It's a fish
[7843.37s -> 7848.50s]  No filter what?
[7848.50s -> 7850.50s]  You guys have to keep linking shit from my birthday
[7850.98s -> 7867.70s]  All right made it wait
[7867.70s -> 7869.70s]  I need the gold key. Ah
[7870.02s -> 7872.02s]  I need the gold key to get in here
[7872.34s -> 7874.34s]  I need that key. I gotta
[7874.34s -> 7876.34s]  There's probably an activator I can do over here
[7877.43s -> 7879.19s]  Scream if you see any buttons
[7879.19s -> 7885.45s]  the reflection of water
[7885.45s -> 7888.70s]  Only shows the surface
[7888.70s -> 7900.47s]  No shit glass will cut you
[7902.26s -> 7905.21s]  I know
[7905.21s -> 7907.69s]  Damn it. I don't see anything. Do you guys see anything?
[7913.30s -> 7915.30s]  Don't get smart on me. What are we talking about?
[7916.10s -> 7919.29s]  I don't see anything
[7919.29s -> 7921.69s]  I can't go back down. Where's the deep end?
[7928.74s -> 7930.26s]  Oh, there it is
[7930.26s -> 7934.90s]  Like I just got that. I got it. I got the key. I picked it up. I got it. I have it
[7938.34s -> 7940.22s]  All right
[7940.22s -> 7943.26s]  I I would not have found that we've been here for a long time
[7944.30s -> 7964.36s]  All right, open it
[7964.36s -> 7966.36s]  Are we still in his follower on the mode off?
[7966.68s -> 7976.39s]  If we put it back on we have to make a joke quick
[7977.03s -> 7981.59s]  What do I do?
[7981.59s -> 7986.33s]  What should I say?
[7986.33s -> 7990.25s]  Turn off slow turn. Okay turn off follower only turn off slow mode
[7996.07s -> 7998.63s]  Now you're asking too much. You're asking way too much
[8011.21s -> 8012.17s]  Wait
[8012.17s -> 8014.41s]  And wait, is it the anarchy is on again?
[8015.53s -> 8017.93s]  No, no, no slow mode. No follower mode
[8018.73s -> 8022.66s]  This is dangerous
[8022.66s -> 8024.66s]  Dangerous waters are crossing here
[8026.25s -> 8027.45s]  I'm gonna die
[8027.45s -> 8030.65s]  Oh, by the way, this is on hard
[8030.65s -> 8050.30s]  Those of you that are wondering give me more. All right, what's the what am I going to eat today? What do you think?
[8051.94s -> 8056.12s]  The first thing that somebody says in chat. I will eat it as long as it's actually edible
[8057.00s -> 8058.68s]  Anarchy can't eat that
[8058.68s -> 8063.35s]  So is it pizza? No, i'm not gonna do
[8066.44s -> 8068.44s]  Wings. Eh, no, i'm gonna do it
[8070.70s -> 8078.57s]  Need a ghost pepper. No
[8078.57s -> 8080.57s]  Big chicken. Hmm
[8081.82s -> 8085.90s]  No, no, no, no, nothing. No fast food today. Nothing. No fast food. I don't want that
[8093.21s -> 8094.98s]  sushi
[8094.98s -> 8096.34s]  now
[8096.34s -> 8098.82s]  No, no, no raw food. Not right now
[8105.14s -> 8107.77s]  low-made and general chicken
[8107.85s -> 8110.73s]  You're almost there. That's pretty that you're almost there. That's close
[8124.22s -> 8127.42s]  Pad Thai
[8127.42s -> 8129.66s]  I would say that that is probably accurate
[8130.70s -> 8132.94s]  Very accurate out. Yeah, that's accurate
[8134.70s -> 8145.24s]  nice work
[8145.24s -> 8146.84s]  Yeah, excellent job
[8146.84s -> 8150.81s]  That sounds fantastic
[8150.81s -> 8153.93s]  Oh, I can already I I can already see it on the plate steaming
[8154.65s -> 8156.25s]  It's so hot
[8156.25s -> 8161.99s]  If I when I just slurp up the noodles it just they whack me all in the fucking mouth and it's like fucking burning me
[8162.15s -> 8164.15s]  But it's where it's worth it
[8166.07s -> 8180.60s]  Uh, I can't go through there
[8181.88s -> 8187.64s]  I don't think there's anything else. I don't want to jump around on these things. It gotta be a button to press
[8188.76s -> 8190.12s]  down here
[8190.12s -> 8191.88s]  Didn't do this yet. Did I?
[8191.88s -> 8194.84s]  Well, I guess we're going up. No, we're not. What is this for?
[8197.62s -> 8207.74s]  Button is that for
[8213.30s -> 8216.50s]  Yeah, I want to show up on stream tomorrow with just these small
[8217.38s -> 8218.34s]  thin
[8218.34s -> 8219.22s]  red
[8219.22s -> 8221.22s]  Lines all around my mouth
[8221.70s -> 8226.42s]  And those are just like noodle burn marks from me just going too fast and eating it too when it's too hot
[8237.32s -> 8241.08s]  That way that way that way that way. No
[8242.95s -> 8244.95s]  Yeah, I'm just going in here. Fuck it
[8246.17s -> 8253.02s]  That moves
[8253.26s -> 8258.30s]  That's my birthday tomorrow. It's my birthday tomorrow. So we're gonna do a face scan tomorrow. Happy birthday
[8259.02s -> 8267.90s]  What's wrong with me? What's going on? Why am I getting hurt by it? Oh, it's fishes in here
[8276.25s -> 8283.99s]  Give me this
[8283.99s -> 8285.99s]  All right, three more to go apparently
[8286.79s -> 8289.03s]  So where those are, I don't know
[8289.03s -> 8290.63s]  And those one up there
[8290.63s -> 8292.63s]  We can just go like this
[8294.17s -> 8295.29s]  Two more
[8295.29s -> 8302.62s]  There it is one more. It's up there
[8307.16s -> 8309.16s]  Ah, you gotta get that one exact. Don't you?
[8309.88s -> 8320.39s]  Buy us a cake
[8320.39s -> 8329.27s]  No, I have to get this
[8329.27s -> 8331.27s]  Damn it. It's gonna be perfect
[8334.58s -> 8336.58s]  There it is. All right
[8337.83s -> 8340.63s]  So sequence complete that means what exactly?
[8345.30s -> 8349.14s]  We want ice cream instead
[8349.14s -> 8352.86s]  It's this turn
[8352.86s -> 8353.66s]  Oh
[8353.66s -> 8355.66s]  That's what that did cool
[8357.42s -> 8358.78s]  Turned on the fountain
[8358.78s -> 8363.90s]  That'd be a really expensive birthday
[8364.22s -> 8371.21s]  when their tv show about they've exactly what we're describing having like 5000 people go to a birthday party with a bunch of stuff and cake and
[8371.29s -> 8372.25s]  like
[8372.25s -> 8376.38s]  ponies to ride and
[8376.38s -> 8378.38s]  There was a thing about this. It was a tv show
[8379.10s -> 8389.99s]  It's called like my big birthday. What was it? It's on like mtv or something
[8391.32s -> 8396.28s]  And these people spent like seven or eight million dollars on their kid's birthday party
[8397.24s -> 8405.21s]  My it was my yeah my sweet 16, right?
[8406.17s -> 8409.74s]  That's what it was
[8416.55s -> 8420.39s]  Oh, I did it in the same fucking spot concentrate. Damn it
[8424.25s -> 8426.25s]  Yeah, that celebrities would come perform
[8427.22s -> 8430.02s]  At their birthday parties in a private concert
[8432.01s -> 8434.76s]  I'll tell you this right now
[8434.76s -> 8436.76s]  There's no I would never
[8437.83s -> 8443.11s]  I would never go. Okay, it's a somebody's house and do like a private germa stream
[8446.17s -> 8448.17s]  When that I think that would be sort of strange
[8451.88s -> 8457.72s]  Well, how would I how would that work? Why just get go in your house and set up a computer and just stream from your house?
[8460.02s -> 8463.06s]  You would what if you were paid? No, I don't think I could do that. That'd be fucking weird
[8466.54s -> 8469.99s]  But but where do you come in?
[8469.99s -> 8472.87s]  What's your what's your play on this? What is this?
[8473.91s -> 8475.51s]  Do you watch
[8475.51s -> 8477.51s]  the stream from a different room
[8478.49s -> 8482.41s]  You just have your ipad and you're just watching it from another room
[8488.28s -> 8496.25s]  How much money are you gonna give me for this what what how how much should I be charging for that?
[8505.80s -> 8513.05s]  $5,000 I'd rather you just buy a car for your
[8514.49s -> 8517.10s]  your
[8517.10s -> 8519.18s]  Just go buy a go buy a car
[8526.25s -> 8527.03s]  a
[8527.03s -> 8528.41s]  $5,000 car
[8528.41s -> 8532.12s]  Hey, you can probably get like an old honda civic
[8532.76s -> 8538.66s]  Those things gonna have like two or three hundred thousand miles on them and still run like they just came out of the factory
[8541.80s -> 8547.05s]  I would know
[8547.05s -> 8549.05s]  All right, then here's how I would do that
[8550.58s -> 8552.58s]  I would do that for a
[8552.72s -> 8554.72s]  $5,000 mcdonald's gift card
[8555.42s -> 8560.22s]  And those of you that are asking I can't that's impossible. You have to call and special custom order that
[8561.74s -> 8564.54s]  And if they if they won't do it for you, you have to find a way
[8566.73s -> 8570.97s]  You have to call corporate and somehow put $5,000 on a mcdonald's gift card
[8588.31s -> 8591.51s]  My civic has 208 000 miles on it or something, right?
[8592.78s -> 8594.70s]  You you get it
[8594.70s -> 8602.87s]  You get it
[8602.87s -> 8604.87s]  Did I fall off in the worst possible spot?
[8605.43s -> 8619.32s]  I did didn't I?
[8619.32s -> 8622.87s]  What's that?
[8622.87s -> 8624.87s]  Omega lull ruined
[8625.98s -> 8628.30s]  The streamer owns a civic laugh out loud
[8629.26s -> 8631.26s]  Uh, yeah, that's not what you said. I'm paraphrasing
[8642.47s -> 8644.31s]  Oh super
[8644.31s -> 8646.41s]  but
[8646.41s -> 8648.73s]  All right, save it here 29 health. This is bad
[8655.22s -> 8665.02s]  Ask and you shall receive can this streamer drive a stick? No
[8666.54s -> 8668.81s]  and
[8668.81s -> 8672.68s]  Why would I want to?
[8672.68s -> 8675.74s]  Let me let me demonstrate the life of a stick driver
[8694.42s -> 8696.42s]  Imagine doing that for like two hours straight
[8698.58s -> 8701.06s]  Imagine you had imagine you was stuck in traffic for like three hours
[8710.73s -> 8713.05s]  Everybody i've ever been in a car with a drove a stick
[8715.10s -> 8718.30s]  It's just like it was a full-time job to drive that car
[8719.10s -> 8725.19s]  Guys I have problems turning on the wipers in my car. You think i'd be able to drive a manual
[8728.92s -> 8731.64s]  I've driven the same car for a long time and I still
[8732.60s -> 8736.68s]  Still when it rains which uh, what what setting does the one how do I go halfway?
[8736.68s -> 8740.36s]  So it only goes the blades go up and down every like half second. I don't I don't know
[8741.16s -> 8743.16s]  I'm just gonna guess until I get the way that I want it
[8745.42s -> 8746.94s]  You think I can handle a manual?
[8746.94s -> 8765.88s]  Oh, he just directs him with that god damn it
[8765.88s -> 8767.88s]  That sucks
[8770.38s -> 8775.64s]  I headshot him. That's the only man saving
[8776.76s -> 8791.18s]  You wonder what am I actually what hey, I have actually a pet peeve for automobiles. Would you like to hear it?
[8792.30s -> 8795.58s]  You guys want to hear it? Yeah. Okay, i'll tell you
[8796.84s -> 8798.12s]  so
[8798.12s -> 8800.04s]  when somebody has
[8800.04s -> 8801.80s]  a horn
[8801.80s -> 8804.12s]  That is not a regular horn
[8806.38s -> 8808.38s]  everybody knows what a car horn sounds like
[8808.94s -> 8812.84s]  when you have a car horn that just goes like
[8814.52s -> 8816.52s]  Universal everybody knows what that sound is
[8817.00s -> 8819.30s]  When somebody has a custom car horn
[8820.60s -> 8825.72s]  You i've heard it. I feel like my car exploded when I hear somebody use a custom car horn
[8826.28s -> 8827.88s]  If they're near me
[8827.88s -> 8831.96s]  And it's like uh, it's just like something's i'm gonna get hurt
[8833.59s -> 8835.59s]  or like
[8840.44s -> 8842.87s]  It's like
[8842.87s -> 8846.63s]  I it freaks me the fuck out man. It scares the shit out of me
[8853.64s -> 8865.35s]  And nobody's prepared for it this one time I pulled up to a red light
[8866.30s -> 8870.78s]  And i'm not even kidding
[8870.78s -> 8876.55s]  The guy held his horn down and it was the peewee herman lab. I don't even know how the fuck you did that
[8887.35s -> 8889.35s]  fake fake
[8889.51s -> 8894.15s]  fake
[8894.15s -> 8896.15s]  He left this place, but what?
[8896.31s -> 8902.39s]  Holy shit, that is insane
[8904.06s -> 8908.54s]  Well, that wasn't the actual peewee herman lab. No, okay, you got me but it sounded like it it was like
[8910.07s -> 8912.92s]  I can't even do it
[8913.00s -> 8915.00s]  It was like
[8916.31s -> 8918.78s]  It was crazy
[8918.78s -> 8923.16s]  it's like
[8923.16s -> 8925.48s]  And then they they beat it really quickly. So it was like
[8928.68s -> 8931.59s]  I was like that's peewee herman
[8931.59s -> 8940.55s]  Literally right next to me
[8940.55s -> 8949.67s]  Can I get some goddamn help? What if it was just peewee out the window? I don't know
[8953.40s -> 8955.40s]  Somebody's doing drive-by peewee hermans
[8959.45s -> 8961.45s]  No, it was definitely their horn
[8961.69s -> 8963.93s]  And they may have had a regular horn that just sounded like shit
[8966.01s -> 8968.18s]  Or I may have dreamed this
[8968.18s -> 8971.35s]  I don't know
[8971.35s -> 8978.65s]  I got fucking dead
[8978.89s -> 8992.10s]  Shit, I didn't know you were here. No, I walked into it again
[9001.26s -> 9003.26s]  Softlock? No, just don't get hit
[9011.78s -> 9020.89s]  See now here's a follow-up question to those of you that have any idea
[9021.69s -> 9025.53s]  Are there any laws or regulations on what you can and cannot have?
[9027.40s -> 9030.92s]  For a custom car horn if you spent the money to have one
[9032.22s -> 9034.39s]  Could you have
[9034.47s -> 9036.47s]  Like for instance like a like homer simpson
[9037.91s -> 9039.91s]  Like a doe could you have that?
[9041.08s -> 9042.36s]  Actually, yes
[9042.36s -> 9046.12s]  So on in what legislation did they have to write down?
[9047.40s -> 9049.48s]  A wuga is okay and like
[9050.76s -> 9053.38s]  Is okay
[9053.38s -> 9058.02s]  That's how that's written down somewhere like submarine going down
[9061.21s -> 9064.81s]  That somebody had to write that right? So what's another what are other ones that are illegally allowed to have?
[9068.74s -> 9073.02s]  the awuga clause
[9073.02s -> 9074.78s]  a police siren
[9074.78s -> 9078.54s]  Uh, that's not
[9078.54s -> 9084.09s]  Why what if it's my custom car horn? I just want everyone around me to think there's some fucking emergency
[9087.59s -> 9100.06s]  You can't have a train horn. What did I open that came down something came down that I wonder
[9100.06s -> 9102.06s]  What is a lot? I need to look this up after the stream
[9102.90s -> 9106.58s]  What custom car horns are allowed and are there only two of them?
[9109.80s -> 9112.92s]  Okay, wait every motor vehicle when operated by a highway
[9113.80s -> 9115.80s]  Must be equipped with that. I didn't see it
[9119.59s -> 9123.10s]  Look up right now
[9123.10s -> 9126.54s]  Oh, you you actually mean look it up right now not look upright
[9127.34s -> 9129.34s]  okay, um
[9130.78s -> 9134.86s]  What is legal for a custom car horn?
[9137.74s -> 9142.94s]  Existing law require a motor vehicle when operated upon a highway to be equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of emitting
[9143.02s -> 9151.02s]  Sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of no less than 200 feet but prohibits a horn from emitting an unreasonably loud or harsh sound
[9153.70s -> 9156.10s]  This does this does not say anything about homer simpson
[9159.30s -> 9161.30s]  Laws on car horns. Hold on
[9161.62s -> 9167.83s]  Okay, so the law today
[9171.74s -> 9176.86s]  Yeah, yeah, it is it is it is illegal to use a car horn for any purpose other than to express warning
[9177.82s -> 9179.82s]  In the state of washington for instance
[9179.82s -> 9185.18s]  The law reads the driver of a motor vehicle shall when reasonably necessary to ensure safe operation give audible warning with his horn
[9185.50s -> 9188.14s]  But shall not otherwise use such a horn when upon a highway
[9188.62s -> 9192.78s]  Well, this is this is bullshit because drive by literally any local politician
[9193.42s -> 9194.46s]  uh
[9194.46s -> 9196.46s]  Group of people holding signs
[9197.42s -> 9199.26s]  Yeah
[9199.26s -> 9206.38s]  Hey, yeah, I agree with you. That's not real. It has to be on there somewhere
[9209.19s -> 9215.88s]  Penalties
[9215.88s -> 9218.20s]  Do you know anyone who has ever been busted for honking?
[9218.28s -> 9224.04s]  Probably not can you get arrested for like using your horn when you're not supposed to this doesn't say where's the homer simpson line though?
[9224.52s -> 9226.36s]  custom car horns
[9226.36s -> 9234.66s]  Can you replace a car horn? No, this is how to fix a broken car. Is this even on the books?
[9235.22s -> 9244.12s]  I don't know about arrested. This is important though
[9247.75s -> 9250.23s]  Are train horns illegal in my state?
[9253.78s -> 9258.58s]  There isn't one as long as it isn't extremely loud and it yeah as long as it's used to alert others
[9269.35s -> 9272.95s]  If you're impersonating emergency vehicles or breaking sound laws, then yeah
[9273.59s -> 9276.71s]  Okay, but what if I had a perfectly legal sound?
[9277.51s -> 9279.51s]  audible level of
[9280.86s -> 9282.30s]  Let's say
[9282.30s -> 9283.98s]  gordon ramsay
[9283.98s -> 9285.98s]  Saying like fuck off
[9288.41s -> 9291.98s]  Is that could is that does that like is that a loophole?
[9297.24s -> 9300.92s]  You could argue it but a cop might stop you
[9304.89s -> 9308.57s]  All right. Where do we go this way this way this way up? I can't go through what?
[9309.45s -> 9317.32s]  All right. I gotta pay attention. No more car horns. What if it was what if you did what if you did the dark souls?
[9317.32s -> 9319.32s]  Hey, hey
[9332.28s -> 9333.96s]  And by the way
[9333.96s -> 9335.16s]  why
[9335.16s -> 9339.67s]  This is important. This is important discussion. Why is there only a horn to say?
[9340.63s -> 9344.39s]  Fuck look out and why is there not like a you go ahead or a
[9345.03s -> 9350.87s]  Hi or a be careful. Why how come there's only one horn why this shouldn't be like two or three different horns
[9357.91s -> 9360.15s]  like a gentler one that's instead of being like
[9360.87s -> 9361.91s]  it's like
[9361.91s -> 9367.99s]  What what and that means something that's not like a hard horn like hey, you can go ahead you go first or
[9370.65s -> 9373.29s]  your
[9373.29s -> 9377.05s]  Your brights are on yeah, just something that's softer and nicer
[9378.55s -> 9381.91s]  Where the fuck am I going? Um, all right, I think down here
[9382.79s -> 9386.18s]  There's a fish in there
[9386.66s -> 9390.18s]  Flash flash your lights, but you could distract somebody that way
[9391.14s -> 9393.14s]  if it was very clear that like the
[9394.74s -> 9398.50s]  Was something very light and like oh, hey, you gotta turn your lights on or
[9402.81s -> 9413.90s]  Where should I go?
[9413.90s -> 9424.28s]  Go to bed scream out your window
[9426.15s -> 9428.39s]  No enough people do that already
[9429.35s -> 9438.65s]  I'm turned around here. I gotta go the right way. All right, found it. Okay, I found it
[9439.61s -> 9451.40s]  He's like people yelling at each other screaming out the window and shit, but that didn't solve anything
[9452.36s -> 9456.70s]  But you never you're never gonna see the person ever again. You'll never see that person again
[9460.73s -> 9463.13s]  Like you know, you're a fucking idiot. You know that
[9463.85s -> 9469.05s]  Okay, i'll never see you. I will never see you again. Like I don't that that carries no weight on me
[9470.01s -> 9479.24s]  See for say see you in court
[9482.95s -> 9496.58s]  Those doors are gonna open
[9501.11s -> 9502.71s]  People behind the wheel
[9502.71s -> 9507.19s]  Something happens people go people go fucking nuts when they're like operating a car
[9507.91s -> 9509.91s]  We already talked about like the speed thing
[9512.14s -> 9514.94s]  But let's refresh for those of you that weren't here for the class
[9517.06s -> 9520.18s]  When people go like 20 miles per hour over the speed limit
[9521.22s -> 9523.22s]  And they get to the same red light as you
[9524.26s -> 9527.62s]  it's just like don't I wish there was a horn for like
[9528.42s -> 9530.18s]  Like told yourself
[9530.18s -> 9532.26s]  Like oh look look how far that got you
[9532.74s -> 9535.14s]  Why can't there be a horn that that everybody knows is
[9536.18s -> 9538.76s]  Look how far that got you. I would love it
[9539.48s -> 9544.41s]  I would use it fucking all the time
[9544.65s -> 9555.98s]  Oh, I had to like change lanes like
[9557.18s -> 9559.18s]  Rip around you know
[9561.26s -> 9563.02s]  Oh is that your car
[9563.02s -> 9567.74s]  It in the at the same red light as me and i'm driving normally
[9569.21s -> 9572.81s]  I imagine that person just sitting behind the wheel just gripping the wheel going like fuck
[9573.77s -> 9575.77s]  Fuck
[9580.10s -> 9582.10s]  I feel like those people don't want red lights
[9582.58s -> 9584.58s]  Why can't I just drive through this?
[9585.50s -> 9587.50s]  I just want to just let me go. I don't care
[9589.98s -> 9591.34s]  and then like
[9591.34s -> 9595.74s]  They just blow a fucking snot rocket like in the bottom of their own car. That's what I pictured
[9597.46s -> 9598.74s]  And they try to get out the window
[9598.74s -> 9599.54s]  They rolled the window down
[9599.54s -> 9603.54s]  They're trying to blow a fucking snot rocket out the window and they miss and they hit they hit the same spot
[9603.94s -> 9606.26s]  Where the handle is for the door that they've hit
[9607.14s -> 9611.06s]  50 times already and this just stains there from them trying to do that
[9611.62s -> 9637.00s]  Go fast. Oh, there it is. Oh, I gotta go fast. All right, hold that thought you have the rovers living in your head rent free
[9638.04s -> 9644.33s]  I don't know. It's i'm telling you something happens to people when they like get wild on the fucking wheel
[9647.18s -> 9649.90s]  And I feel like that same person if you were to bring this up to them
[9650.30s -> 9654.30s]  In a conversation about like and you and you don't know that they're like one of these like crazy drivers
[9654.70s -> 9656.70s]  They would say the same shit
[9656.86s -> 9662.94s]  They'd be like, yeah. Yeah, I really hate that. I really don't like people speed value and scream out the window and blow snot rockets
[9663.26s -> 9666.46s]  It's just it's just not okay. It's not okay
[9667.58s -> 9669.58s]  You're you it's you
[9680.89s -> 9685.69s]  Well, it must then it must be you because you're talking about it i'm the one doing it
[9690.92s -> 9695.56s]  Hey dude, i'm high as fuck. All right
[9697.19s -> 9715.40s]  Good to see you
[9715.40s -> 9717.40s]  Oh, right. I don't have my weapons
[9718.10s -> 9719.86s]  Saved did I save it yet?
[9719.86s -> 9731.06s]  Living in your head rent free
[9734.76s -> 9736.34s]  Yeah
[9736.34s -> 9740.02s]  Because what it happens you're like what the fuck is wrong with this person?
[9745.51s -> 9748.87s]  Dude, I have seen so many people drive around
[9750.38s -> 9754.30s]  Remember remember the two places that I have been living in in my life
[9756.06s -> 9757.59s]  boston
[9757.59s -> 9759.83s]  Like east coast and then las vegas
[9761.27s -> 9767.59s]  I've seen so many people on the highway just fucking ripping around lanes driving like a psycho
[9769.35s -> 9772.09s]  screaming at each other
[9772.09s -> 9773.85s]  Cutting each other off
[9773.85s -> 9776.07s]  playing cut off tag
[9776.07s -> 9782.92s]  With each other. It's like what the fuck are you people doing?
[9783.56s -> 9802.38s]  Have I you've never had road rage before
[9802.86s -> 9807.02s]  Oh, i've been i've had like my share of i'm upset at something going on and on the road
[9807.82s -> 9810.94s]  But never like i'm upset at something going on in the road
[9811.02s -> 9816.86s]  So now let me accelerate to at 30 miles per hour over the speed limit and overtake three people
[9817.18s -> 9839.94s]  While I blow snot rockets on my windshield. He's obsessed with this
[9841.78s -> 9845.69s]  This one I just want goddamn safe driving I just want safe drivers
[9856.17s -> 9858.89s]  It's even worse when you pull up behind those people
[9859.37s -> 9864.57s]  And they've got those stickers on the back of their car that show I how many children are in the family
[9867.51s -> 9873.03s]  Oh, yeah, there's me there's dad and there's there's one two three four children. Oh
[9874.15s -> 9878.41s]  Are you in the car now?
[9878.41s -> 9894.18s]  What do you okay? How many children are in? Okay, I gotta start shooting things
[9895.06s -> 9911.96s]  Oh, this is tricky
[9915.54s -> 9917.22s]  I need silver key
[9917.22s -> 9925.13s]  Remember that these guys are hard to melee
[9934.42s -> 9936.42s]  Silver silver remember silver silver
[9942.39s -> 9947.32s]  Anything I missed down here?
[9947.32s -> 9949.32s]  What stock superpower is the best?
[9952.60s -> 9954.71s]  uh
[9954.71s -> 9958.79s]  well, there's there's a lot of loaded question because
[9960.07s -> 9964.31s]  Is this superpower that you have that you're the only person that has this superpower?
[9964.87s -> 9967.43s]  And if you choose flying all of a sudden you become
[9968.23s -> 9972.95s]  Like public enemy number one. There's a person flying and we have to do something about that person
[9973.67s -> 9975.83s]  Or is it like we live in a superhero society?
[9983.53s -> 9985.53s]  Just like we're in a superhero
[9989.21s -> 9992.78s]  world
[9992.78s -> 9994.78s]  uh the best stock power
[9997.13s -> 9999.13s]  No, it's not. It's not invisibility. It's not
[10000.65s -> 10002.89s]  Guys, you could if you're invisible you still die
[10005.78s -> 10008.18s]  Like if you're invisible, you can still step on a landmine
[10009.54s -> 10011.62s]  So no, you still die. I would say
[10012.58s -> 10016.41s]  I'm dead. Yeah
[10016.41s -> 10018.41s]  Like hypo just said time control
[10019.42s -> 10021.50s]  And nothing too extreme. I just mean like
[10022.38s -> 10024.38s]  being able to rewind
[10025.53s -> 10027.42s]  maybe like
[10027.42s -> 10029.42s]  Maybe like like 10 minutes
[10030.55s -> 10038.28s]  Right 10 minutes you just can you you can make the universe go back 10 minutes whenever you want
[10040.81s -> 10046.49s]  Nothing bad happens. It's just you have control over this device that makes it so the whole world rewinds 10 minutes and nobody knows
[10049.91s -> 10054.63s]  You know how many times i've like left my wallet somewhere or like oh fuck my keys are in just rewind and just grab them
[10055.43s -> 10065.32s]  Or like if you ate something that you didn't want to eat and you didn't like it if you went to the menu
[10065.96s -> 10067.40s]  And you said okay. Here's um, uh
[10067.40s -> 10070.52s]  I want the steak, please and you order you get the steak and you eat it and you don't like it
[10070.52s -> 10072.52s]  Just rewind and order something else
[10072.52s -> 10076.20s]  You seriously wouldn't want that power to go to a restaurant and be able to eat and then rewind to pick something else
[10081.50s -> 10085.82s]  Okay, adam sandler, by the way adam sandler is up for an academy award probably
[10086.46s -> 10091.34s]  So all of you adam sandler haters out there just know that that dude is
[10091.90s -> 10095.58s]  Is going to potentially win the best actor of the year award
[10097.51s -> 10101.18s]  Go look it up
[10101.18s -> 10103.18s]  You think we're in the darkest timeline?
[10104.18s -> 10107.14s]  You a lot of you guys talk a lot of shit about mr sandler
[10108.57s -> 10112.09s]  And now he's up for fucking one of the most coveted acting awards potentially
[10112.89s -> 10115.66s]  that exists
[10115.66s -> 10127.34s]  Okay, i've got i gotta kill these fucking things. I need ammo on a weapon
[10127.90s -> 10132.71s]  There's no weapon ammo line around here. These guys can just aim and shoot
[10134.30s -> 10136.18s]  He's not gonna win
[10136.18s -> 10137.46s]  You know what?
[10137.46s -> 10140.02s]  I kind of hope he does
[10140.02s -> 10141.46s]  I kind of hope he does
[10141.46s -> 10143.78s]  In in some weird way. I hope he does
[10149.46s -> 10151.46s]  I hope adam sandler wins best actor
[10152.18s -> 10160.41s]  You know those like events that people say is the event that happened
[10161.05s -> 10164.01s]  That really crossed us over and that was the turning point
[10165.61s -> 10170.57s]  Adam sandler winning best actor at the academy awards might be that event and I can't fucking do this
[10178.57s -> 10180.09s]  Turn around
[10180.09s -> 10191.08s]  What turn around?
[10191.08s -> 10193.16s]  That's that's the start of the world ending events
[10193.96s -> 10197.00s]  No, i'm just gonna go buy them
[10197.00s -> 10202.70s]  It was open
[10202.70s -> 10210.50s]  God give me a break
[10210.50s -> 10211.38s]  um
[10211.38s -> 10215.85s]  Shit sure, but joel is behind you
[10216.49s -> 10225.10s]  Is it wait what happened over here? This is this the turn around thing?

[10253.99s -> 10255.99s]  Yes, he's still in the bathroom

[10713.27s -> 10717.58s]  I'm, not sure if you were here like a half an hour ago
[10717.58s -> 10720.70s]  So maybe 45 minutes ago, but I was trying over and over again to get this to work
[10721.42s -> 10727.58s]  I couldn't get it to work. So I I was getting so fucking just actually not even like joke angry. I was just getting like
[10728.54s -> 10733.11s]  I just like not I wasn't feeling it and I was gonna turn the stream off and shit. So I just figured
[10733.83s -> 10735.83s]  Just don't don't even get that far, you know
[10737.03s -> 10751.05s]  I just feel myself getting actually just truly annoyed and it was just like
[10752.25s -> 10754.25s]  This is not fucking the way that I want to be
[10755.05s -> 10757.53s]  So I just I just gave up on it and I said I wasn't gonna try it anymore
[10767.42s -> 10770.62s]  And I know that I know that I lost a few people today with just how fucking
[10771.18s -> 10773.90s]  Seriously, just how annoying and angry I was and I I know

[10811.29s -> 10816.57s]  Web of lies. No one knows what's actually real. No one knows what's actually real
[10818.04s -> 10820.28s]  They don't know which way we're going
[10821.82s -> 10824.86s]  All the while the water's flowing
[10826.63s -> 10829.67s]  Is it raining? Is it pouring?
[10833.88s -> 10836.36s]  And it's certainly not showing
[10837.56s -> 10839.56s]  any charge that
[10840.68s -> 10842.76s]  What if I just fucking started screaming that

[11093.96s -> 11098.20s]  i'm okay
[11098.20s -> 11100.92s]  I know the way that I just said that made it seem like no I did not
[11101.64s -> 11113.43s]  No, what i'm starting to do is i'm starting to do some uh
[11114.23s -> 11117.13s]  some stretches
[11117.13s -> 11119.61s]  So i'm specific to rib and back
[11120.47s -> 11122.47s]  costochondritis
[11123.38s -> 11125.38s]  Stretches and I got this little device
[11126.26s -> 11130.50s]  that helps you put it under your back and it helps uh stretch out your muscles and
[11131.22s -> 11133.62s]  You lie on it for a little while. I'm gonna try it and see if it helps
[11134.50s -> 11136.50s]  Also, well at the same time
[11136.58s -> 11140.02s]  Uh, i've got like other appointments to go to and everything but
[11141.14s -> 11143.14s]  It is not quite a foam roller
[11143.30s -> 11145.30s]  It's almost like a little wedge
[11145.38s -> 11147.94s]  That you have to kind of lie on to help stretch your back
[11152.82s -> 11154.82s]  All right, somebody just wrote something so
[11155.70s -> 11157.85s]  fucking crazy
[11157.85s -> 11170.39s]  I can't even
[11170.39s -> 11172.39s]  All right, here comes
[11172.39s -> 11178.70s]  A I don't know boss fight maybe no possible. Where are you all the way over here?
[11183.16s -> 11188.38s]  Testicles in stomach
[11188.38s -> 11192.24s]  Yeah, I have to have this I have this uh condition guide guys called costochondritis
[11193.10s -> 11196.46s]  Is when your testicle sucks up into your stomach?
[11198.52s -> 11200.95s]  Yes, that's what it is
[11200.95s -> 11203.99s]  You don't even have to google it to know that it's not true, but you don't have to have to do that
[11203.99s -> 11205.99s]  I googled it for you
[11207.46s -> 11215.03s]  That was the thing people were saying, uh the other night the pilgrims what?
[11219.99s -> 11221.99s]  Stop i'm trying to read
[11226.87s -> 11229.99s]  Get out of here. Oh my god, go back to tekken
[11230.95s -> 11237.45s]  What's that character's name bill?
[11237.45s -> 11249.38s]  The pilgrim path. No, it's like seven pages long. I can't I don't want to do it
[11261.80s -> 11270.44s]  Billy tekken
[11270.44s -> 11280.26s]  Whoa, you guys take a lot of explosive damage
[11291.26s -> 11293.26s]  Oh, no, he shot earth
[11293.82s -> 11297.02s]  Does that mean i'm huge?
[11297.02s -> 11303.42s]  How many you got in here?
[11303.66s -> 11305.66s]  You're gonna you're gonna fuck up my save state
[11307.08s -> 11309.08s]  Why am I killing these guys? I don't know
[11310.15s -> 11311.75s]  Why do you kill anybody in any video game?
[11311.75s -> 11316.15s]  It's because the computer decided that they were gonna be in front of you and they were a monster that you are
[11316.15s -> 11317.99s]  a bad guy
[11317.99s -> 11326.15s]  Oops
[11326.15s -> 11342.92s]  We're good. Uh, let me show you this way
[11343.88s -> 11346.89s]  this way
[11346.89s -> 11350.22s]  This way looks pretty ominous
[11350.86s -> 11354.70s]  What's over here? I was just here, right?
[11356.06s -> 11360.79s]  Yeah
[11361.62s -> 11372.57s]  I can't see shit
[11373.29s -> 11375.29s]  Good who else
[11386.02s -> 11390.66s]  Hey, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey, somebody just said game sucks. That's not fair
[11392.95s -> 11394.95s]  Why did you say that? That's not true
[11400.62s -> 11405.42s]  What's your reasoning what's your reasoning the floor is yours
[11406.06s -> 11418.09s]  I think that was the death
[11418.09s -> 11419.13s]  That's it
[11419.13s -> 11421.13s]  They don't say anything else. They just come in and say that
[11430.76s -> 11432.12s]  What's this gonna do?
[11432.12s -> 11436.87s]  What did that do? Oh, well did that?
[11440.02s -> 11445.91s]  Uh, we're up
[11450.31s -> 11452.47s]  Just running around and attacking things
[11455.70s -> 11457.62s]  You know
[11457.62s -> 11461.62s]  They don't make them like they used to anymore. They don't make them like this anymore
[11462.58s -> 11465.94s]  They don't make them like this anymore where you're just you're dead
[11465.94s -> 11470.34s]  It's just a game and I need to stop fucking like making little jokes
[11470.98s -> 11472.82s]  And get back up there
[11472.82s -> 11493.08s]  Those these guys live here. Why are you doing this?
[11498.74s -> 11502.42s]  Because it's like an evil castle or something with like demons and shit
[11503.46s -> 11505.46s]  Yeah, demons live in hell
[11509.72s -> 11511.72s]  What's the point there?
[11514.60s -> 11517.00s]  Load your quicksave am I am I fucked right now?
[11521.40s -> 11523.08s]  No, this is the the
[11523.08s -> 11525.94s]  Where's the elevator come down?
[11525.94s -> 11527.22s]  It goes down to where?
[11527.22s -> 11548.25s]  Where's that elevator?
[11548.25s -> 11550.81s]  Hold on. I'll get another 30 seconds and i'm gonna load the quicksave
[11552.60s -> 11553.96s]  30 more seconds
[11553.96s -> 11557.06s]  Hold on. I know it's like I can get there from here. I think
[11572.65s -> 11573.69s]  No
[11573.69s -> 11575.69s]  Stop wasting ammo too. What are you?
[11576.01s -> 11577.61s]  Insane
[11577.61s -> 11579.61s]  All right. I think i'm almost there
[11579.61s -> 11581.61s]  I'm gonna get there just in time
[11592.76s -> 11602.36s]  I'm gonna go
[11604.36s -> 11606.33s]  That was a bad idea
[11606.33s -> 11610.81s]  And now i'm way worse than I was off before
[11611.37s -> 11618.09s]  Everybody else left alive
[11618.09s -> 11622.18s]  So that's the way we gotta go
[11622.18s -> 11628.20s]  What's down here? Ooh green candies
[11629.16s -> 11650.26s]  One more out of both. How could you not like it?
[11651.62s -> 11653.62s]  It's got candy
[11663.03s -> 11666.79s]  I think the best part about this game is probably
[11668.41s -> 11671.86s]  I like how the weapons
[11672.26s -> 11674.26s]  The variety of weapons is pretty good
[11679.27s -> 11684.15s]  I think my favorite weapon is probably the
[11685.27s -> 11687.27s]  Thing i'm holding right now
[11697.42s -> 11699.26s]  But they're all good
[11699.26s -> 11705.11s]  Found it
[11705.11s -> 11707.11s]  somebody
[11740.58s -> 11756.68s]  I think I went this way already. Oh, there it is. Holy fuck. I almost just died dude
[11756.84s -> 11771.88s]  If I remember if I was standing over there it'd be like Neptune Mars Pluto
[11773.51s -> 11775.80s]  Mars
[11775.80s -> 11785.74s]  Uh, I don't know green
[11787.02s -> 11807.66s]  Nothing else up here. No sequence. Can we get an actual Neptune? You already have it. It's the worst emote on the channel
[11808.46s -> 11816.78s]  I know that's very debatable. But still that's a pretty hot topic
[11822.34s -> 11829.46s]  If you truly think that germapop is the worst emote on the channel, I i'm sorry, but we completely disagree
[11830.74s -> 11833.14s]  it's so much so
[11833.14s -> 11835.56s]  that I
[11835.56s -> 11839.24s]  That's like you telling me that almond joy is your favorite candy
[11840.06s -> 11842.02s]  I'm gonna say this
[11842.02s -> 11849.78s]  What are you talking about? Like like Reese's peanut butter cups exist. That's not possible. We just will never agree on anything
[11850.50s -> 11865.62s]  boss time
[11865.62s -> 11867.62s]  This kind of just looks and smells like a boss
[11868.26s -> 11871.82s]  What does that say?
[11871.82s -> 11873.82s]  You are being watched. I know
[11875.58s -> 11878.14s]  But by how many people do you know? Yeah, this is a boss
[11879.30s -> 11880.98s]  All right. Here's the deal
[11880.98s -> 11882.98s]  I know I hold on
[11883.22s -> 11886.82s]  This is going to be the last thing I do on the stream today. We'll see you tomorrow after this
[11888.87s -> 11892.23s]  For I don't know. Maybe maybe I'll convince someone to play halo
[11893.03s -> 11893.91s]  maybe
[11893.91s -> 11895.03s]  I don't know
[11895.03s -> 11896.47s]  It's possible
[11896.47s -> 11898.55s]  um
[11898.55s -> 11899.83s]  There's also
[11899.83s -> 11904.89s]  I'll be here before the stream starts tomorrow. There's a couple of games that i've been waiting to play
[11905.93s -> 11909.37s]  We'll see if I can get somebody to maybe play it if not if maybe i'll just
[11910.33s -> 11913.21s]  It's such a sour note at this point that like a halo I go
[11913.77s -> 11917.93s]  It's just I think it might need to exist as that whole it might just have to exist
[11918.73s -> 11923.82s]  That way. Oh, yeah, I also have a device. That's interesting that I want to play with
[11924.98s -> 11926.10s]  We'll see
[11926.10s -> 11933.53s]  I'll just do the campaign solo. Yeah, I might just like I don't know. We'll see it's gonna it'll be a game time decision
[11934.89s -> 11937.06s]  We'll figure it out tomorrow
[11937.06s -> 11939.06s]  But i'm still doing this
[11939.46s -> 11942.15s]  The corrupt spirit. Oh, it is an eye
[11942.79s -> 11951.80s]  A lot of health. Oh boy. All right
[11952.84s -> 11957.29s]  I think i'm just gonna dodge
[11957.29s -> 11965.16s]  I didn't have enough. Okay, you know
[11974.95s -> 11975.91s]  Ow
[11975.91s -> 11981.96s]  Am I even hitting him?
[11981.96s -> 11984.68s]  Ow, he's just throwing fucking cinder blocks at me
[11985.40s -> 11993.56s]  Ow, ow, ow
[11993.56s -> 12002.52s]  You can't really dodge him either
[12002.76s -> 12005.72s]  I think I just have to stand still and like just go back and forth like this
[12006.84s -> 12011.58s]  That's the play
[12011.58s -> 12016.30s]  What's phase two?
[12016.30s -> 12028.18s]  Is there a phase two?
[12029.96s -> 12032.84s]  Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it
[12039.38s -> 12041.38s]  oof oof oof
[12041.94s -> 12058.58s]  Did I actually get hit by that fucking thing?
[12058.82s -> 12060.18s]  Oh, man
[12060.18s -> 12061.62s]  I'm out of ammo
[12061.62s -> 12063.62s]  What do I have any ammo for any weapon?
[12064.97s -> 12066.97s]  I don't this is really bad
[12067.77s -> 12075.54s]  run away
[12075.54s -> 12077.54s]  Oh, I have to go up
[12077.62s -> 12079.62s]  Ow, please
[12079.62s -> 12084.86s]  No
[12084.86s -> 12088.74s]  Ben, how are you actually getting those in here?
[12089.38s -> 12093.13s]  I actually would rather be up here. This is a good spot for this
[12093.93s -> 12095.62s]  All right. I'm staying up here
[12095.62s -> 12099.91s]  Let's heal and let's use these
[12100.07s -> 12115.75s]  Are they reaching?
[12115.75s -> 12117.75s]  Here they come
[12118.07s -> 12125.94s]  Give me some help
[12125.94s -> 12132.95s]  Is he burning me?
[12132.95s -> 12146.12s]  He's putting fire down
[12146.12s -> 12149.00s]  Shit that hurt
[12149.00s -> 12152.20s]  Oh fuck this fire everywhere now. All right. Don't fuck this up. This took a long time
[12153.00s -> 12173.03s]  Oh fuck
[12173.03s -> 12175.03s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[12176.55s -> 12179.21s]  Oh, no, no
[12179.21s -> 12188.49s]  Did it just don't die
[12188.65s -> 12195.59s]  Star of torment
[12195.59s -> 12199.11s]  I didn't even know this existed. I probably would have should I should have picked this up
[12200.41s -> 12204.30s]  Would have helped
[12204.30s -> 12206.30s]  You can die. I guess this doesn't matter the level's over
[12207.02s -> 12208.90s]  All right, get out
[12208.90s -> 12211.22s]  What about a secret though? I may have missed a secret
[12212.02s -> 12213.46s]  Not like it matters
[12213.46s -> 12226.89s]  I don't have I gotten one secret on any of the boss fights. I don't think I have
[12227.53s -> 12246.97s]  That's for another playthrough
[12246.97s -> 12248.57s]  And let's go
[12248.57s -> 12253.80s]  No secret
[12253.80s -> 12254.84s]  killer
[12255.46s -> 12256.58s]  Scholar
[12256.58s -> 12259.06s]  See you guys something not to read this stuff would you get achievements for it?
[12267.10s -> 12269.10s]  There are two more areas to do
[12270.14s -> 12271.91s]  I'm not gonna lie
[12271.91s -> 12273.91s]  I kind of like it medieval
[12275.66s -> 12276.94s]  as
[12276.94s -> 12281.58s]  A yeah, we can just keep playing that and just keep like slowly finish it. I like this
[12289.29s -> 12294.33s]  Up at the next time I play this it'll probably be over. It's a pretty fun. Just chill game to play
[12295.13s -> 12301.14s]  What are your first impressions? It's pretty it's good
[12301.94s -> 12306.30s]  Arcane expanse is the best area
[12307.18s -> 12310.82s]  It's a time for cleanup detail. No
[12311.30s -> 12313.30s]  No, we'll just look we're gonna start fresh tomorrow
[12314.76s -> 12318.36s]  If you missed the first part of this stream, it was a absolute shit show
[12318.92s -> 12321.32s]  But in somehow the best possible way, I think
[12321.88s -> 12323.88s]  It was a fucking disaster
[12328.55s -> 12332.26s]  But uh, we'll see you tomorrow
[12332.26s -> 12338.07s]  Thanks, uh again for uh box box for the raid if any of you guys are still here
[12341.16s -> 12343.16s]  Thanks for coming. Thanks for sticking around
[12343.24s -> 12353.21s]  See you tomorrow
[12353.21s -> 12355.21s]  What happened? We I just got here
[12355.61s -> 12357.51s]  uh
[12357.51s -> 12360.47s]  It's it's it's it's impossible for me to explain
[12361.11s -> 12363.11s]  the first two hours of the stream
[12363.43s -> 12364.95s]  it's kind of just
[12364.95s -> 12367.03s]  It was just it was
[12367.03s -> 12369.03s]  A wonderful disaster. We'll put it that way
[12369.83s -> 12372.07s]  Thank you for the halo diarrhea. You're very welcome
[12376.18s -> 12378.18s]  All right. Let's uh, let's call it a night
[12378.66s -> 12385.62s]  Start fresh tomorrow
[12385.62s -> 12400.09s]  Thanks for watching good stuff
[12401.45s -> 12405.29s]  Hey, let's just check it and see hey, who's top sub gifter richard nixon. Yep
[12406.55s -> 12410.15s]  Top bits I like to relish and top bits, too
[12410.79s -> 12413.19s]  Uh, I can't even read it. It was too small
[12413.75s -> 12419.38s]  Richard nixon. Thank you. Richard nixon for always giving 50 subs to stream somehow
[12421.02s -> 12422.14s]  I
[12422.14s -> 12426.63s]  I don't know. All right, let's head back to the
[12428.15s -> 12429.43s]  bits
[12429.43s -> 12431.59s]  Those of you that don't know
[12431.59s -> 12433.75s]  If you are a new viewer, I do not read
[12434.55s -> 12439.11s]  Subs or bits or donation or bit messages during the stream. We do it at the end
[12439.75s -> 12444.12s]  Let me just hang out for like 30 to 45 plus minutes and just chill and talk
[12444.84s -> 12446.28s]  That's how it works
[12446.28s -> 12454.18s]  Let's go back. Thank you to sad vega
[12454.98s -> 12456.74s]  for the 300 bits
[12456.74s -> 12460.90s]  Howdy germa just doing that reminder that we'd love to go through some emote options with a vote sometime
[12461.46s -> 12467.30s]  Still really looking to hold out for that weird emote of where they photoshopped the eye. So you looked
[12468.34s -> 12470.34s]  So, oh, yeah
[12471.10s -> 12473.46s]  Yep
[12473.46s -> 12476.02s]  The one that I thought was a real picture during the thing
[12476.66s -> 12485.72s]  Yep, it's a great picture. It is
[12486.62s -> 12488.62s]  It has to be an emote. It will
[12488.62s -> 12504.50s]  Thank you though
[12504.50s -> 12506.50s]  Lazy look. Thanks to the 250. Hey
[12506.74s -> 12513.75s]  Hey, how are you? That's it. Hey sad vega again for 300 bits. Thanks sad vega
[12514.31s -> 12517.27s]  I've said it before and i'll say it again house cleaning stream when
[12517.99s -> 12520.31s]  Just go pro it and clean your house
[12520.79s -> 12522.79s]  You seem to love vis or cleanup detail so much
[12523.19s -> 12527.35s]  You could easily make a joke video of you just cleaning a place with a mop and a bucket and chat would eat it up
[12528.07s -> 12531.91s]  Honestly, it doesn't even have to be your house. You can make like a joke studio set where you screw up
[12534.44s -> 12537.32s]  I think we've actually talked about that stream before
[12538.57s -> 12540.57s]  Of just cleaning a house on stream
[12544.28s -> 12548.14s]  What that's but it
[12548.14s -> 12550.14s]  Every time I think about how funny something like that could be
[12551.16s -> 12554.12s]  Like yes, imagine a scenario where I rent out a studio
[12555.16s -> 12559.32s]  And just make it just a dirty office or just like a dirty living room
[12562.74s -> 12565.70s]  Make it all dirty. So then I just clean the room
[12568.98s -> 12571.10s]  That stream would take
[12571.10s -> 12579.48s]  Hours to make it dirty and then hours to immediately clean it up would be so fucked up
[12585.72s -> 12591.02s]  But it would be fun
[12591.02s -> 12593.02s]  Maybe for a little while
[12603.72s -> 12605.72s]  vis or detail warp. Yeah
[12608.49s -> 12614.57s]  No, there's a lot of things that are in front of that that need to get done first before something like that would even be thought about
[12616.25s -> 12618.25s]  two or three fake rooms
[12618.92s -> 12622.12s]  Yeah, have like a fake house, but then I would rather just do the sims thing
[12622.68s -> 12624.98s]  All right, I told you about that how I wanted that
[12626.89s -> 12628.89s]  Just make in a studio
[12629.53s -> 12633.85s]  A big fake house and you guys control me and it's i'm just it's sim
[12638.58s -> 12640.58s]  I have to like pee and shit
[12642.31s -> 12646.55s]  I have to be I have to be like social I have to go do things. I have to like call people on the phone and stuff
[12647.19s -> 12657.64s]  We talk about a lot of weird shit here, but some of them actually turn into streams
[12663.27s -> 12665.27s]  Hey flug boy. Thanks for the 250
[12665.67s -> 12669.99s]  I honestly saw this from a fucking millennia away when you said joel was playing with you
[12670.07s -> 12675.03s]  I knew this was going to happen. I knew joel would have the attention span of a goldfish
[12675.83s -> 12680.95s]  But I love you both for this. Thank you for the stream reach is probably like one of my top 10 games of all time
[12684.20s -> 12696.42s]  That's so funny, I love it he foresaw it they both have the same attention span
[12705.32s -> 12708.12s]  Yeah, you just gave you gave two children the keys
[12714.38s -> 12717.42s]  But thank you flug boy. I still had a lot of fun
[12720.62s -> 12724.86s]  Hey grapple mace. Thanks for the 250. Jeremy, please play picross again sometime
[12726.86s -> 12728.86s]  Well, depending on how the stream goes tomorrow
[12729.50s -> 12734.78s]  You know this this this home. This might be an entire non-canon week
[12736.07s -> 12742.71s]  Depending on what happens tomorrow. We'll see
[12747.90s -> 12749.90s]  filler content week
[12753.42s -> 12761.54s]  We'll see the extended universe
[12763.75s -> 12766.44s]  I love picross. It's like it's one of my favorite
[12767.16s -> 12769.16s]  Lie down with your nintendo ds and do
[12769.72s -> 12774.28s]  It's like the reason why I even owned a ds was to play picross with the little stylus on the little screen
[12775.16s -> 12779.85s]  I didn't play a zelda game on that thing. I didn't buy pokemon
[12783.10s -> 12785.98s]  I did not own pokemon. I did not own I just
[12788.47s -> 12798.89s]  I bought it for picross
[12798.89s -> 12800.89s]  And there was another game too
[12801.05s -> 12803.42s]  What did I play on the ds sometimes?
[12807.40s -> 12811.32s]  Play pokemon tomorrow or riot lose 95 percent of your viewer base
[12815.70s -> 12820.02s]  If you're still here after the last two streams, I don't think I would lose 95 percent of you
[12822.06s -> 12823.34s]  Yeah
[12823.34s -> 12835.19s]  Let's be honest
[12835.19s -> 12837.19s]  Let's go. That's it. Let's get out of here
[12842.06s -> 12846.86s]  No, actually i'm i'm of the opinion that I I thought I thought the last two streams in a row were like
[12847.50s -> 12850.80s]  Fun like really fun, even though there was like a diarrhea
[12851.94s -> 12854.82s]  I thought I just I still had fun as the thing
[12864.04s -> 12866.04s]  Thank you post for the 500 bits
[12866.52s -> 12870.06s]  Has everyone been watching since the early tf2 days and you never failed to make me laugh
[12870.78s -> 12872.62s]  Your huge inspiration to me
[12872.62s -> 12874.62s]  as another guy with adhd
[12874.78s -> 12877.10s]  While I do respect it seeing you make the decision to move
[12877.66s -> 12881.10s]  To hospice care after your hernia really hit me hard. Here's to you
[12881.74s -> 12883.74s]  Jeremy will never forget you
[12883.90s -> 12889.58s]  Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Thanks for the 500 bits
[12892.02s -> 12895.22s]  Hey, good night, man. Thanks for waking me up by my name a little while ago
[12897.56s -> 12906.34s]  That actually worked
[12906.34s -> 12912.97s]  Thank you post though for the 500 bits. Did I miss a 100 dollar bit donation? I missed 10 000 bits
[12913.53s -> 12914.81s]  long time ago
[12914.81s -> 12916.44s]  how
[12916.44s -> 12918.44s]  This is me and joe were arguing
[12918.44s -> 12919.56s]  about
[12919.56s -> 12922.36s]  Who was bullying the other one to play halo, which by the way
[12924.04s -> 12926.04s]  Like five days ago
[12926.30s -> 12930.22s]  I was like, hey you wanted to play let's play halo. Okay, sounds fun
[12933.82s -> 12936.06s]  And then he's and then he just fucking I could hack it
[12936.78s -> 12938.78s]  He did the thing on discord when it was like
[12939.18s -> 12941.42s]  You see, oh joe joe is typing
[12941.98s -> 12943.26s]  Not anymore
[12943.26s -> 12945.26s]  Joel is typing not anymore
[12945.58s -> 12946.94s]  Okay
[12946.94s -> 12948.94s]  Joel is currently typing and not anymore
[12949.62s -> 12951.69s]  Okay
[12951.69s -> 12955.37s]  And I got this this huge like holy shit, man, I really want to be really here like hey
[12955.45s -> 12957.45s]  I fucking don't even like that franchise
[12958.01s -> 12960.63s]  I'm gonna be i'm gonna be pretending
[12961.61s -> 12963.77s]  I know it's your favorite franchise of all time
[12964.65s -> 12970.20s]  But I can probably only I can probably only pretend for like two hours tops and I was like, it's all good, man
[12970.20s -> 12972.20s]  Whatever like you i'm sure you'll have fun
[12972.76s -> 12977.18s]  And then I was like I was i'm pretending too like i've played all these games already
[12979.21s -> 12983.05s]  I've beaten halo reach like 15 times like 10 times at least it's like one of my favorite games and i'm like
[12983.05s -> 12992.92s]  Oh my god, we'll just we'll just both pretend doesn't matter and he's like, all right, cool
[12997.53s -> 12999.53s]  I hate halo, too
[13002.60s -> 13005.08s]  That's my first experience with halo
[13006.98s -> 13013.88s]  Besides being on a college dorm room with an xbox chunky controller in my hand for five minutes
[13017.74s -> 13021.54s]  I wouldn't have it any other way. He thought you were a halo streamer
[13026.95s -> 13030.79s]  The whole thing is funny so it doesn't it's fucking hilarious
[13036.55s -> 13039.83s]  But i'm jared and gave 10 000 bits earlier
[13041.56s -> 13043.56s]  Thank you so much. I'm sorry. I missed it
[13045.93s -> 13048.81s]  There's a huge amount of money to miss and i'm really sorry that I did
[13049.29s -> 13051.53s]  I think that was in the middle of the crisis we were having
[13053.69s -> 13057.85s]  They said this has been the absolute best podcast i've ever listened to you. Thank you so much for this amazing time
[13058.57s -> 13063.61s]  We covered a few topics. Yeah

[13066.73s -> 13070.33s]  Hey germo, what's your opinion on sitting on the toilet looking at your phone and ruining?
[13071.13s -> 13072.17s]  the
[13072.17s -> 13076.89s]  Wait, what what's your opinion on sitting on the toilet looking at your phone and running the hair dryer on yourself all
[13077.37s -> 13079.37s]  At the same time when nobody is home
[13081.59s -> 13090.84s]  What like blow drying your hair while you're on the toilet?
[13097.61s -> 13100.42s]  What's my opinion on that?
[13100.50s -> 13105.27s]  um
[13105.27s -> 13109.56s]  You only have two hands
[13109.56s -> 13114.68s]  So if you're on the toilet and you have the iphone in one hand and a blow dryer on the other
[13116.65s -> 13118.30s]  How are you?
[13118.30s -> 13122.54s]  My opinion on is you don't have a third hand. What do you do you put the phone on the ground?
[13122.54s -> 13124.06s]  Do you don't have a pocket?
[13124.06s -> 13126.62s]  Put the blow dryer down on the floor
[13127.74s -> 13132.74s]  My opinion is
[13132.74s -> 13134.74s]  I don't like it. That's it
[13136.78s -> 13140.78s]  Uh gtx 1080 quad sli. Thanks for the 250 bits
[13141.66s -> 13146.42s]  Hello, jeremy. What's your recommended method of consuming a Reese's cup?
[13147.14s -> 13148.90s]  And why is it your favorite candy?
[13148.90s -> 13153.78s]  Anyways, can't wait to squad up with you in fortnight 2 tomorrow while eating the 25 meal deal
[13154.58s -> 13156.58s]  from burger king cheers
[13156.82s -> 13158.82s]  From that's not who sent the message
[13162.14s -> 13163.80s]  Uh, well
[13163.80s -> 13166.04s]  The how I eat Reese's all in one go
[13167.99s -> 13169.27s]  Open it up
[13169.27s -> 13173.51s]  Take the whole uh Reese's paper off and put the whole thing in my mouth
[13174.23s -> 13176.23s]  And slowly enjoy the the whole cup
[13179.67s -> 13183.83s]  And oh, there's no wrong with it. No wrong way to eat a Reese's. Yes. Yes, there is
[13185.67s -> 13190.79s]  I like oh, I put my tongue through it and push out the peanut butter and then I put with my hand
[13191.03s -> 13195.75s]  I put up my nose and swallow it through my nasal cavity. That's a wrong. That's wrong. Don't do that
[13196.15s -> 13198.55s]  What why do they people don't even eat Reese's like that?
[13201.06s -> 13203.38s]  There was a whole ad campaign. It was like well, how do you do it?
[13203.54s -> 13207.78s]  Well, I peel off the edges and then I dunk it in milk and then I I squish it between my teeth
[13207.86s -> 13211.30s]  No, you just eat it. You don't know. It's a candy. It's a fucking chocolate bar
[13215.80s -> 13218.28s]  Is it's not yeah, it's not an oreo. It's a Reese's
[13223.64s -> 13228.60s]  And by the way, there's only two ways to eat an oreo three what you either eat it just bite into it
[13229.16s -> 13232.78s]  Or you like do the turn and then you like I well what I do
[13233.34s -> 13237.58s]  Is I turn it and I look off the cream and then I that's what I do
[13237.82s -> 13240.54s]  Okay, that's the that's the second and out of two
[13241.10s -> 13245.96s]  ways to eat a oreo
[13246.04s -> 13256.47s]  Okay
[13257.43s -> 13261.19s]  Let me show you how a real man eats a chocolate sandwich cookie
[13263.90s -> 13265.90s]  That's all right. Here's how you do it
[13266.38s -> 13268.62s]  You take you grab the oreo
[13269.26s -> 13274.46s]  With your forceps and you know what that means. That's thumb and middle finger. Don't use your index finger
[13274.46s -> 13276.30s]  What are you out of your mind?
[13276.30s -> 13277.34s]  thumb
[13277.34s -> 13279.50s]  And index a thumb and middle finger
[13280.38s -> 13283.59s]  Grab the edge of the cookie lift up
[13284.47s -> 13287.51s]  Your fingers should be no more than halfway down the cookie
[13288.90s -> 13291.83s]  Okay, you then dunk that cookie
[13292.63s -> 13295.19s]  Not to the point where your fingers are touching the milk
[13296.73s -> 13298.73s]  a little bit less than halfway
[13299.05s -> 13302.33s]  Just let it sit there for about one. This is sippy two
[13303.29s -> 13304.57s]  three
[13304.57s -> 13306.81s]  Four lift it out
[13306.81s -> 13310.65s]  Tap tap tap on the edge to the excess milk bite into that
[13311.74s -> 13316.38s]  That's how you do it. Then you grab that little half moon that you have there hold it the other way
[13316.38s -> 13318.38s]  So it's you're holding it long ways now
[13318.70s -> 13320.70s]  And keep doing it in half and then you eat the whole thing
[13326.22s -> 13329.42s]  You do it for four seconds. No, just like bang bang
[13330.14s -> 13332.14s]  Bang done lift it out
[13333.80s -> 13339.10s]  On the edge. There you go
[13339.18s -> 13344.06s]  I will say that I don't I don't know how people eat oreos just dry
[13344.86s -> 13347.86s]  out of the can
[13347.86s -> 13350.10s]  Eating oreos is like eating saltines
[13351.66s -> 13353.66s]  It's like
[13353.82s -> 13366.86s]  I feel like I could cough and dust will come out of my mouth saltines are good. Yeah, I know
[13367.86s -> 13369.22s]  that but
[13369.22s -> 13373.22s]  It's like eating a saltine if you eat just a if you eat a raw oreo cookie
[13374.26s -> 13377.46s]  It's just like it turns into this weird sandy dusty mush
[13380.31s -> 13382.63s]  I love these hot take sections of the stream
[13389.88s -> 13393.70s]  What do you think a cookie is
[13393.70s -> 13397.22s]  Okay, let's go another layer. We'll go one more step here
[13398.92s -> 13399.96s]  uh
[13399.96s -> 13401.80s]  should a cookie be
[13401.80s -> 13403.10s]  soft
[13403.10s -> 13405.98s]  Or soft and chewy or crunchy and brittle
[13406.71s -> 13410.07s]  This is going to determine how many of you get removed from the channel
[13417.02s -> 13420.02s]  Well, most of you get to stay
[13425.78s -> 13427.78s]  soft and chewy cookies
[13430.41s -> 13433.10s]  are just
[13433.10s -> 13437.18s]  the best
[13437.18s -> 13440.86s]  crunchy cookies
[13440.86s -> 13442.39s]  No
[13442.39s -> 13446.60s]  No, I wouldn't
[13446.60s -> 13448.34s]  I don't hate
[13448.34s -> 13450.18s]  hard and crunchy cookies
[13450.18s -> 13452.65s]  But there is a line
[13452.65s -> 13454.89s]  Where if you bite into if I bite into a cookie
[13456.22s -> 13468.31s]  And it turns into five cookies that's unacceptable and that's what happens a lot of times
[13473.27s -> 13476.63s]  Soft chewy you can just bite into it. It's it's
[13477.25s -> 13479.69s]  moldable
[13479.69s -> 13481.74s]  They're durable
[13481.74s -> 13484.38s]  If you drop a soft cookie on the ground, it's not going to shatter
[13485.18s -> 13489.13s]  If you drop hard cookie on the ground it shatters and then you're gonna you can't eat it anymore
[13494.44s -> 13502.84s]  Shatterproof this idiot eats cookie dough
[13504.94s -> 13508.74s]  uh
[13508.74s -> 13510.98s]  Is that some kind of strange unpopular opinion?
[13512.12s -> 13513.32s]  to like
[13513.32s -> 13516.47s]  cookie dough
[13516.47s -> 13522.71s]  Cookie dough. It's a it's everywhere. It's in every ice cream shop. It's the most popular ice cream
[13523.33s -> 13525.33s]  flavor, it's the most
[13525.43s -> 13531.27s]  Every cookie dough is like synonymous with a lovely thing that everybody likes. That's like saying you don't like bacon
[13531.27s -> 13545.77s]  What are you not epic?
[13545.77s -> 13548.33s]  Hey a pink iru. Thanks for the thousand bits
[13553.67s -> 13554.79s]  Thank you
[13554.79s -> 13558.44s]  They say thank you for providing a ton of laughs and giving us an escape from reality
[13559.08s -> 13562.52s]  Life can get us down sometimes but a laugh in a tough moment can make all the difference
[13563.32s -> 13568.28s]  Going through a rough bit a bit of a rough patch and your streams are always the highlight of my week
[13568.84s -> 13572.84s]  Watching you and Joel interact made me laugh the hardest I have in months. I can't wait for the next one
[13574.33s -> 13576.22s]  Neither can I
[13576.22s -> 13580.07s]  Should be a lot of fun

[13601.66s -> 13605.18s]  Bits

[13609.40s -> 13611.40s]  That means we change scenes
[13611.40s -> 13617.86s]  I know how to stream

[13648.89s -> 13656.34s]  Don't worry. I've been subbed for a year and I just realized I need new sub
[13657.14s -> 13664.06s]  I need new sub badges. It's just coming up on that point where I never thought that was even going to be a thing
[13665.91s -> 13669.83s]  Looking down that way. Oh three two three year sub badges
[13670.63s -> 13672.87s]  I was like, I don't think that'll ever happen
[13673.03s -> 13678.23s]  I don't know. I don't think people will sub for three straight years, but I guess it'll be here and now it
[13678.47s -> 13681.45s]  that's a reality a lot and
[13683.14s -> 13685.94s]  That you could do four five six years in a row
[13687.66s -> 13688.94s]  Holy shit
[13688.94s -> 13695.14s]  Who would sub for that long? Ew
[13695.54s -> 13700.38s]  one of our founders
[13700.38s -> 13702.79s]  grump clump
[13702.79s -> 13704.79s]  49 month subscriber

[13745.83s -> 13749.59s]  I expect that this was going to be a flawless stunning playthrough of halo reach instead
[13749.59s -> 13753.59s]  I watched over an hour or so of what was a hilarious chaotic and truly beautiful disaster
[13754.23s -> 13756.31s]  One hell of a 26th birthday gift
[13757.59s -> 13759.19s]  Let's love friendo
[13759.19s -> 13763.13s]  Thank you

[13774.84s -> 13777.00s]  Nothing for I think 30 or 40 straight minutes
[13779.26s -> 13780.46s]  but
[13780.46s -> 13784.86s]  Happy 26th birthday. Hope you had a good one
[13788.50s -> 13790.50s]  Thank you so much for the 1500 bits
[13790.66s -> 13792.76s]  Happy 26th birthday

[13795.94s -> 13800.25s]  It's not time
[13800.25s -> 13803.05s]  I still have a full day and a half. What do you mean? It's not time for that
[13803.69s -> 13806.30s]  I remember
[13806.30s -> 13808.30s]  Uh eugene. Thanks for the 250
[13809.29s -> 13811.29s]  When are you going to apologize to fortnight jimmy?
[13811.85s -> 13816.76s]  I already did
[13816.76s -> 13821.96s]  Sergio, but thanks for the 250 sergio, but serious question. Do you eat starburst with or without the paper on?
[13826.34s -> 13827.78s]  you just
[13827.78s -> 13828.90s]  unlocked
[13828.90s -> 13830.73s]  in my head
[13830.73s -> 13835.69s]  Something that I haven't even you've unlocked something. I don't know what it was you unlocked
[13837.66s -> 13839.10s]  I did do this
[13839.10s -> 13841.42s]  But well, I don't think it was with starburst. What was it with?
[13843.35s -> 13845.35s]  I had this very very
[13845.67s -> 13849.27s]  Distinct memory of chewing on paper and moving it around and moving it
[13856.06s -> 13859.69s]  What was that?
[13859.69s -> 13861.69s]  No, not tootsie rolls not tootsie rolls
[13863.59s -> 13865.59s]  What was it? It was paper and I remember
[13866.66s -> 13868.66s]  No, not cupcake wrapper
[13873.82s -> 13876.15s]  shit
[13876.15s -> 13879.43s]  the candy dots
[13879.43s -> 13881.11s]  I think you got it
[13881.11s -> 13884.71s]  Yeah, I used to I used to tear off a piece and I would just put the whole thing in my mouth and chew on it
[13884.71s -> 13886.71s]  And just pick it off and spread it around
[13890.68s -> 13892.68s]  Yep. Yeah, that's what it was
[13893.24s -> 13894.60s]  I would just
[13894.60s -> 13897.40s]  Tear off a piece and I would just stick it in there and just slowly
[13898.20s -> 13903.32s]  Mush it around in my mouth and gums and stuff until it popped off and then I would move the paper to the side
[13905.88s -> 13909.96s]  Anyways, um, no, I didn't I did not do that with starburst. I did that with the dot the candy dots
[13912.58s -> 13915.62s]  Yeah, yeah the candy buttons that were on the sheet of paper
[13916.34s -> 13922.68s]  Those things were awesome, too. They even still make those
[13923.40s -> 13925.90s]  Probably buy them on amazon or something
[13927.74s -> 13931.42s]  Also, praise that son bro. Thanks for the 500 bits
[13932.38s -> 13934.62s]  Jeremiah passed my cdl test today

[13942.06s -> 13943.74s]  Past your cdl
[13943.74s -> 13948.23s]  Well, would you look at that?
[13948.23s -> 13950.92s]  Pass my cdl
[13950.92s -> 13952.92s]  What's what is that cdl?
[13953.00s -> 13965.46s]  Is it like sat's?
[13965.62s -> 13967.62s]  Is it a driving test?
[13970.41s -> 13973.05s]  Driving your cdl driver's test
[13973.69s -> 13976.09s]  It's for a driver's life. Oh, well fucking hell. Yeah
[13976.89s -> 13982.36s]  You can use that five thousand dollars and get yourself a honda civic
[13983.08s -> 13985.08s]  Well, you you were here earlier, right?
[13985.40s -> 13994.18s]  You had to have been here it allows for trucking and taxi driving. Oh shit
[13995.88s -> 14000.65s]  Well, nice job
[14000.65s -> 14004.33s]  Get the tesla truck. I have not you know, you want to talk about hot takes
[14005.13s -> 14007.29s]  I've not even given you my take on the tesla truck
[14009.61s -> 14011.77s]  But it's it's at this point. I've already i've said
[14013.00s -> 14016.84s]  I just imagine the words that I would have said you already know the people have already made the jokes a thousand times
[14018.89s -> 14025.61s]  I I can't it's been too long. I I could say oh yeah, nintendo 64 car. You've seen that on twitter probably a thousand times
[14028.06s -> 14030.62s]  I could say it looks like it's made out of aluminum foil
[14031.26s -> 14043.02s]  You've probably heard that already
[14043.02s -> 14046.66s]  So there you go. Just that's what I that's my take
[14051.19s -> 14054.47s]  Please only original jokes and the windows. Yeah, I know the windows though
[14055.51s -> 14057.51s]  You can't break them. I broke it
[14059.75s -> 14061.75s]  Right. Yeah, we all know this already
[14062.31s -> 14065.85s]  They don't have any wait, hold on for a second
[14065.85s -> 14069.05s]  I I was about to get really really really crazily upset about what you just said
[14069.53s -> 14071.53s]  I thought you said they don't have any cup holders
[14071.77s -> 14079.30s]  It's like how do you make a but what do you mean? No cup holders in the whole car?
[14084.62s -> 14086.62s]  Not having a cup holder
[14092.95s -> 14096.90s]  You drink from a hose
[14096.90s -> 14100.42s]  There are no mirrors. No, there there has to be mirrors as it gets illegal
[14106.34s -> 14108.98s]  No mirrors or what's what the crumple zone?
[14109.78s -> 14121.22s]  What is a crumple zone?
[14121.22s -> 14124.90s]  Crumple zone that sounds like a section of like a disney park
[14127.61s -> 14131.69s]  Like crumples zone. It's like a gnome or something crumple zone
[14132.33s -> 14139.43s]  So it's like a crash zone
[14142.60s -> 14144.60s]  It's for crashes so you don't fucking die
[14153.86s -> 14156.26s]  Well, okay, welcome to the crumple zone
[14162.26s -> 14166.82s]  Yeah, guys the if you get a tesla truck, you know, it's gonna just sit in your driveway
[14166.90s -> 14168.90s]  So people look out the window and go, ooh
[14170.73s -> 14172.89s]  You know what? You're gonna be you're not gonna be worried about crumple zones
[14181.27s -> 14183.27s]  Oh, that looks dumb
[14184.47s -> 14188.92s]  Oh
[14188.92s -> 14191.80s]  I'm worried about crumple zones. You're a pluto
[14196.78s -> 14201.90s]  I think it looks cool. You know what?
[14203.34s -> 14205.34s]  Let me see tesla truck
[14207.96s -> 14212.12s]  Okay, I wish I could see I feel like we only have one angle of this thing
[14212.52s -> 14214.52s]  Do they have any video of it driving?
[14215.61s -> 14220.33s]  I feel like i've only seen an image of this thing from the side. What does this thing actually even look like?
[14226.86s -> 14228.86s]  Oh shit, this thing is actually kind of cool
[14237.11s -> 14238.71s]  That's what it looks like
[14238.71s -> 14241.54s]  No, that's a different company
[14241.54s -> 14243.54s]  That's a different company
[14243.62s -> 14246.09s]  Okay, never mind
[14246.09s -> 14253.10s]  That one looks cool. That's a cool looking one this thing called called the
[14253.98s -> 14256.41s]  the neuron
[14256.41s -> 14258.41s]  the neuron ev
[14258.49s -> 14260.49s]  That thing is fucking sick
[14261.05s -> 14272.92s]  Look at this thing. Yeah, i'll show you here. Let me put it on
[14273.56s -> 14282.33s]  This thing's called the neuron the neuron
[14294.07s -> 14296.07s]  That's pretty cool looking
[14296.07s -> 14301.37s]  Look at that thing
[14301.37s -> 14304.49s]  That's ugly. No, not the one on the right. I'm talking about the one on the left
[14306.84s -> 14309.34s]  You're a fucking neuron
[14309.34s -> 14312.52s]  What?
[14312.52s -> 14314.52s]  You don't think that that's like that?
[14314.60s -> 14319.93s]  That looks better
[14319.93s -> 14321.93s]  That one doesn't have any doors
[14323.77s -> 14326.58s]  How do you get in?
[14327.22s -> 14329.22s]  It's remote controlled
[14330.97s -> 14334.01s]  You sit on top of it. It doesn't have any doors
[14334.89s -> 14337.21s]  You sit in the back
[14337.21s -> 14340.33s]  All in the back of the pickup load part you sit back there with a wheel
[14345.54s -> 14350.90s]  I think that's a cool. It's I think it's all right. Look at what's what look that actually has like a back
[14351.70s -> 14353.70s]  No, there are no crumple zones
[14360.78s -> 14363.02s]  Looks like mario kart. We will I mean, okay
[14363.10s -> 14366.54s]  It looks it does look like an upgraded thing you can get in mario kart
[14370.54s -> 14372.94s]  That's the cool car that you get in mario kart. Yes
[14377.94s -> 14381.46s]  All right. I will agree the one on the right the one on the right is a little is a little weird
[14382.42s -> 14383.54s]  it
[14383.54s -> 14386.18s]  Is that even a is that a okay? So take a look?
[14386.98s -> 14389.29s]  the one on the right
[14389.29s -> 14391.29s]  Is that the car or is
[14392.38s -> 14396.46s]  It's just a giant shark fin. Why would you do that? Why would you drive that?
[14398.70s -> 14400.38s]  that's
[14400.38s -> 14402.38s]  That's really stupid
[14403.02s -> 14404.14s]  This is huge
[14404.14s -> 14409.82s]  You're gonna go through like a drive-through and you're gonna hit the top of the sign that says like please god
[14409.90s -> 14414.22s]  Don't fucking drive a car here if you're larger than you know what i'm talking about that sign
[14415.10s -> 14419.03s]  I would go into tunnels and scream going through the tunnels
[14423.58s -> 14425.10s]  It's a semi
[14425.10s -> 14434.42s]  Also, it goes back. Okay. I thought it was just like a flounder. I think that one looks all right
[14439.24s -> 14440.70s]  electric
[14440.70s -> 14447.56s]  Truck, it was that the only two of them. What about this one?
[14448.28s -> 14452.36s]  the rivian r1 rivian r1 t
[14453.48s -> 14455.48s]  Let's see. What's fine. When you guys like
[14460.98s -> 14464.26s]  This one's uh, all right. Okay. Hold on. Hold on a second
[14468.73s -> 14471.42s]  Hold on. What do you think about this one?
[14475.66s -> 14477.66s]  this one in particular is
[14478.14s -> 14480.14s]  You you had to create a character
[14481.00s -> 14483.32s]  And you took and you went to the part where it said nose
[14483.96s -> 14485.96s]  And you dragged the nose just forward
[14486.44s -> 14497.26s]  What do you think about this one? That's got a is that a crumple zone? I think that might be a crumple zone
[14501.00s -> 14503.16s]  Is it I see mirrors and I see a crumple zone
[14503.80s -> 14515.00s]  Is this truck even electric?
[14515.00s -> 14517.00s]  It's got a big nose. Whatever
[14523.50s -> 14526.70s]  I mean the truck look the back of the truck doesn't look very big
[14528.31s -> 14532.15s]  You I think you can only fit a refrigerator in there and you have to stand it straight up
[14534.26s -> 14536.26s]  This is the car that bugleberry would drive
[14536.66s -> 14548.76s]  Why do I know what you mean?
[14548.76s -> 14554.50s]  I like that one
[14554.50s -> 14555.93s]  five
[14555.93s -> 14562.97s]  Buy a fridge and then go through the drive-through to hit the sign is that your goal is to fucking wreck the sign
[14568.49s -> 14573.45s]  anyways, um
[14573.45s -> 14576.17s]  I don't even we're okay. So we were
[14577.42s -> 14579.42s]  All right, right praise that son
[14580.20s -> 14582.37s]  Congratulations on passing you cdl
[14582.39s -> 14584.38s]  Thanks for the 500 bits
[14584.38s -> 14589.74s]  Thank you put that put that license to good use
[14592.26s -> 14594.26s]  And then finally we had uh
[14594.64s -> 14596.64s]  psychilos for the 500 bits
[14597.82s -> 14601.10s]  Jerma jeremy and the jerma and the baby is my favorite video of yours
[14601.10s -> 14604.14s]  And I was wondering when we can expect the sequel i've been waiting for six years
[14606.18s -> 14608.18s]  I'm not having any kids
[14608.18s -> 14617.06s]  I'm not having any kids
[14617.06s -> 14624.73s]  No children for me
[14624.73s -> 14627.93s]  No, baby albertson. No not in the plans not on the plans
[14631.64s -> 14634.84s]  I'd rather be the the fun uncle that everybody likes
[14635.64s -> 14642.17s]  That works for me
[14642.17s -> 14644.01s]  Auto is all we need
[14644.09s -> 14651.77s]  I don't know. You're not gonna pass on the funny jeans pepe hands
[14655.24s -> 14657.24s]  No, i'll freeze it. I'll freeze them
[14658.50s -> 14660.50s]  What? Okay, let's keep going
[14660.66s -> 14661.78s]  That was weird
[14661.78s -> 14663.78s]  a bro bought
[14670.90s -> 14678.17s]  I'm just gonna freeze myself so I can like
[14686.25s -> 14690.17s]  That's not what you were saying i'm gonna freeze myself
[14691.59s -> 14694.07s]  And uh in a thousand years
[14695.48s -> 14699.48s]  When they're going through we're gonna go find like the funny people where were they here they are
[14699.88s -> 14705.64s]  Well, we still have it's still available. Jerma 985 is still available. We can we can keep that line going
[14717.86s -> 14719.86s]  Your humor will be too outdated
[14721.53s -> 14734.10s]  That was a good attempt, but uh, the ship is sinking. Oh, you better pick up a pail and start dumping water
[14739.19s -> 14742.97s]  Uh, but uh bro bought formerly soft boy. Thanks the 251
[14744.33s -> 14746.65s]  Hey jerma reach was hilarious a hot mess
[14747.29s -> 14749.29s]  I'm looking forward to what you and joel do together next
[14750.17s -> 14753.29s]  When it when it comes to halo i'm kind of glad this stream turned out this way
[14753.85s -> 14756.49s]  Reach is amazing, but it has heavy themes towards the end
[14756.97s -> 14761.93s]  The first halo game halo combat evolved is pretty easy to set up for pc would really recommend playing that one first
[14762.57s -> 14764.57s]  Reach wouldn't be a bad way to follow it up
[14765.13s -> 14769.13s]  While you're waiting for two and three the main trilogy is comparable to star wars
[14770.82s -> 14772.82s]  Do hand sim co-op with joel?
[14772.98s -> 14779.90s]  Okay, and by the way, we can we can get tired of that in two hours. It don't matter
[14786.68s -> 14788.68s]  We got a halo expert. Yeah
[14789.86s -> 14791.30s]  No, that's good to know
[14791.30s -> 14794.01s]  That is good to know
[14794.01s -> 14796.01s]  And you know what else you're about to know?
[14801.80s -> 14811.26s]  That we've reached the end. Thanks again for watching. Thanks for participating. Thanks for hanging out in this
[14812.62s -> 14814.62s]  messy non-canon
[14814.62s -> 14816.62s]  uh stream

[14825.75s -> 14828.95s]  Because there are a few things we can do depending on
[14830.31s -> 14834.95s]  Who or what is doing things tomorrow? I might try to do maybe we'll try halo again
[14835.91s -> 14838.95s]  That's kind of funny to me that I just pretend like I didn't try yesterday
[14839.91s -> 14841.91s]  um
[14841.91s -> 14843.75s]  There's also
[14843.75s -> 14846.07s]  Well, let me just rifle off the things that are on my mind here
[14848.23s -> 14850.23s]  There's also
[14853.88s -> 14856.70s]  All right, are you ready for this
[14856.70s -> 14858.50s]  there is
[14858.50s -> 14861.64s]  Dead rising 3
[14861.64s -> 14864.28s]  I still have to play the rest of the fear stuff
[14865.77s -> 14867.43s]  fear 2
[14867.43s -> 14869.51s]  The dlc for fear fear 2 has a thing
[14877.91s -> 14881.30s]  We'll see
[14881.46s -> 14883.78s]  No, please no, please not dead rising 3
[14886.87s -> 14889.51s]  I did say that I had to beat it though. I had to do it
[14890.81s -> 14892.81s]  Play the new nancy drew game
[14900.41s -> 14903.61s]  I promised when did I promise I was gonna play nancy drew?
[14904.57s -> 14915.78s]  What are you talking about?
[14916.78s -> 14919.98s]  Nancy drew dead rising 3. Yeah, that's I know that's what i'm saying
[14924.07s -> 14926.23s]  No dead rising 3. Fuck that
[14928.33s -> 14934.49s]  damn
[14934.49s -> 14939.77s]  All right, just because one guy said that i'm gonna look up nancy drew games that have come out on steam
