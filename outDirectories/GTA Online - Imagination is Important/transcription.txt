[0.31s -> 12.02s]  You're gonna have to step on the gas if you want to get this guy. Yeah, he's right there.
[13.32s -> 15.32s]  Yeah, see he's right here, I told you.
[15.32s -> 16.32s]  I landed right next to me.
[16.32s -> 17.32s]  Just wait, wait, wait.
[17.32s -> 23.00s]  Oh, we're here from the afterlife. We're here to kill you.
[23.00s -> 24.00s]  We're gonna kill you.
[24.00s -> 29.00s]  So, take this important advice from us before we go.
[29.00s -> 33.00s]  A raincoat is usually helpful when it's raining. He didn't even get to hear my tip.
[33.00s -> 37.65s]  It's almost impossible to roleplay in GTA V.
[37.95s -> 40.95s]  See, I'm trying to pretend I'm like a firefighter trying to make an honest living.
[40.95s -> 42.95s]  Putting out fires, saving cats.
[42.95s -> 46.95s]  And these two are just being like dickheads, shooting everybody and shooting each other.
[46.95s -> 48.95s]  Can I even, I'm gonna spray the hell out of these guys.
[48.95s -> 51.95s]  Yeah, that's not, you know, the roleplayers are fighting back.
[51.95s -> 54.19s]  I'll spray the hell out of you.
[54.19s -> 56.19s]  You can never stop my power of imagination.
[56.19s -> 58.19s]  I will imagine myself as a firefighter.
[58.19s -> 62.19s]  You'll take your machine guns and shove them up your ass, alright?
[62.19s -> 63.19s]  Shove them up your ass!
[64.76s -> 70.00s]  When this guy comes back from being paused, I am going to fucking destroy him.
[70.00s -> 72.00s]  I'm gonna stick this knife right, don't fuck this up.
[72.00s -> 74.56s]  Oh my god, this guy, please.
[74.56s -> 76.56s]  Are you gonna do what I'm doing to him to me? Please don't do this.
[76.56s -> 78.56s]  This is a great opportunity.
[78.56s -> 80.56s]  Okay, he's not. I think he's gonna help me.
[80.56s -> 83.56s]  Good. Alright, we're both, he takes it like the billy club.
[83.56s -> 85.56s]  No! You!
[85.56s -> 88.69s]  You know, Tim, we really should go to that restaurant.
[88.69s -> 90.69s]  We keep forgetting to go to it.
[90.69s -> 92.69s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
[92.69s -> 93.69s]  We don't touch a police car.
[93.69s -> 95.69s]  Tim, get out of the car. We got a 506 situation here.
[95.99s -> 96.99s]  I'm the bad cop. I'm gonna get you.
[96.99s -> 97.99s]  Shoot these two assholes!
[97.99s -> 99.99s]  Got one of them. Good job, Tim.
[99.99s -> 101.99s]  I don't know who I am.
[101.99s -> 104.99s]  I never knew who you were. Get out of my fucking face.
[104.99s -> 106.99s]  I'm just gonna go this way.
[106.99s -> 108.99s]  I don't know whose car that is, but
[108.99s -> 110.99s]  I really should probably go to a fucking doctor.
[115.92s -> 119.31s]  Fuck. What?
[119.31s -> 121.74s]  Where did you even come from?
[121.74s -> 125.11s]  You are out of your goddamn mind.
[125.11s -> 128.04s]  Come on. Come on, then.
[128.04s -> 130.04s]  Come on.
[130.34s -> 133.84s]  I feel like the old fat guy that ran Jurassic Park.
[133.84s -> 135.84s]  Remember when like the velociraptors coming out of the egg?
[139.47s -> 143.22s]  Okay, so I just went to go get a drink
[143.22s -> 145.22s]  and came back.
[145.22s -> 147.22s]  And this is, this is what's happening right now.
[147.22s -> 150.59s]  I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[150.59s -> 152.59s]  Oh, was I in like a cop car?
[152.59s -> 154.59s]  How am I still alive?
[154.59s -> 157.59s]  I was gone for at least like two or three minutes.
[157.59s -> 159.59s]  These guys have still not killed me.
[159.59s -> 162.59s]  And there's like nine cruisers and like a helicopter right here.
[163.83s -> 167.67s]  You serious right now?
[167.67s -> 170.67s]  I'm gonna slow this down because it's like just absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[170.67s -> 173.67s]  Like this guy flies out of a gingerbread man car.
[173.67s -> 175.67s]  He looks like a gingerbread man.
[175.67s -> 178.67s]  So that's what I figured. It was a gingerbread man car.
[178.67s -> 180.67s]  And that's the end of the clip.
[180.67s -> 183.42s]  Welcome to the end.
[183.42s -> 185.42s]  Billy told me I was an idiot.
[185.42s -> 186.42s]  No, I didn't.
[186.42s -> 187.42s]  Yes, he did.
[187.42s -> 188.42s]  No, you're an idiot.
[188.42s -> 189.42s]  No, you're an idiot.
[189.42s -> 190.42s]  Mom.
[190.42s -> 191.42s]  Mom, he told me.
[191.42s -> 192.42s]  Shut up.
[192.42s -> 193.42s]  Hi, I'm the third child.
[193.42s -> 195.42s]  I do a lot of bad things.
[195.72s -> 197.72s]  Do you expect me to come and hit them?
[197.72s -> 202.04s]  No.
[202.04s -> 204.04s]  I can't believe how much blood is all over me.
[204.04s -> 206.28s]  I look like a clown.
[206.28s -> 208.28s]  It looks like I'm in a clown suit.
[208.28s -> 210.28s]  I'm in a clown costume.
[210.28s -> 212.28s]  Because of this blood.
[212.28s -> 214.28s]  Hey kids, it's me, Bozo the Clown.
[214.28s -> 216.28s]  Happy birthday, I murdered your family.
