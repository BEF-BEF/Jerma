[1.27s -> 13.21s]  Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, I'm there the transmission works. I'm able to transmit data
[13.89s -> 16.02s]  through a wire
[16.02s -> 19.66s]  Into your house. How are you?
[22.34s -> 25.46s]  Unfortunately, it's not perfect. Oh
[27.12s -> 31.67s]  Oh, I feel it. I could feel it. Our internet was
[32.43s -> 34.11s]  fixed in quotes
[34.11s -> 38.14s]  and what that means is it's not fixed and it's
[38.82s -> 40.82s]  It's they're working on it
[41.10s -> 46.84s]  They did something they screwed something up and they're trying to fix it. But unfortunately for us
[49.27s -> 51.27s]  We have to deal with it
[52.46s -> 54.66s]  Hopefully does not drop that many times
[55.34s -> 57.40s]  Hopefully doesn't drop to zero
[57.40s -> 65.96s]  But I I gotta try right? I can't just like oh bye. See you later guys. I'll see you in like three weeks
[66.52s -> 69.96s]  I've got to try and
[70.60s -> 74.42s]  this is what this stream is we're gonna try and
[79.77s -> 81.37s]  And
[81.37s -> 85.81s]  It's Alex and I because it talks is having this problem too because he also lives here. We've been running
[86.61s -> 89.51s]  full twitch tests
[89.79s -> 95.83s]  You didn't know twitch has test servers that you can just stream to and it's a pretend fake stream
[96.43s -> 99.67s]  and we've been doing this for about two straight days now and
[100.51s -> 103.71s]  The problem is way less evident than it was
[104.35s -> 109.31s]  Three or four days ago, but with anything who has any idea?
[109.91s -> 112.47s]  What may have seemed okay
[113.55s -> 119.79s]  Yesterday for the whole day with a few drops here and there it was like, alright, we get a whole day of green
[119.83s -> 124.47s]  Let's go. I'm going for it. And that's what this stream is. And then right when we turn it on, of course it's problems, but
[125.27s -> 131.02s]  What do you say we talk about since it's been a while? It's been like five six days since I last streamed
[131.62s -> 133.74s]  That was not my intention
[133.74s -> 140.34s]  But a couple of things happened if you didn't see I tried to keep some of it a secret over the weekend
[140.90s -> 143.70s]  I was part of the vinesauces. Hope
[144.70s -> 148.06s]  Joel's vine wrestle segment. I invaded
[148.54s -> 156.50s]  Jerma Jerma wrestling Federation invaded vine wrestle. I didn't really talk about it because I wanted they wanted to be a surprise
[157.14s -> 158.58s]  so I didn't really
[158.58s -> 166.06s]  Say much about it, but I won't give you any spoilers, but if you haven't seen it, I recommend it
[169.18s -> 175.62s]  Hyphus crossover. That was a lot of fun. And although I wasn't able to stream on my own channel
[175.66s -> 179.62s]  I was able to participate in that and it was awesome for a great cause. They do that every year and
[180.42s -> 182.42s]  I'm just happy to participate
[182.46s -> 186.34s]  But yeah, I did that. We've also got a couple of ideas
[186.98s -> 193.94s]  for the future and
[193.98s -> 195.98s]  what I mean by that is
[196.02s -> 200.27s]  in the future in like
[201.60s -> 205.34s]  Don't do this to me. Come on. It was green fucking for the last like
[206.44s -> 208.04s]  15 hours
[208.04s -> 210.04s]  Come on
[210.48s -> 215.32s]  You got you got to give this to me it's been too long you got to give this to me
[217.95s -> 220.99s]  It's trying
[220.99s -> 229.30s]  But anyways, I'm just I'm just looking over here at the like drop frames. I'm just like no, no, please don't do this to me
[229.82s -> 237.20s]  Please I just want to stream. I just want to turn off my live stream. I don't know what they did but
[240.87s -> 243.91s]  Besides the carnival stream we're just gonna sit here and talk for a minute because
[244.55s -> 248.75s]  It's been a while. So besides that carnival stream, which is coming up in probably late September
[249.51s -> 256.77s]  There's another stream that I want to do that would be really fun and it involves the idea that we talked about
[257.85s -> 261.01s]  the where's Waldo stream where
[261.53s -> 268.45s]  Somebody or people come together as a community. They make up some fun slides where I have to find on the stream me
[269.21s -> 271.21s]  green screen cutout on stream
[271.61s -> 273.93s]  now
[273.97s -> 275.61s]  That sounds like a lot of fun
[275.61s -> 279.65s]  but then I thought about you know, what would be better instead of it just being a
[280.05s -> 287.13s]  Segment where oh, I'm gonna do like 30. Where's Waldo slides. No, I'm gonna do on this stream
[287.13s -> 291.29s]  I will give you it will once I get everything set in stone. They're probably in a few weeks
[292.01s -> 297.45s]  I want to do an entire highlights magazine stream. I'm talking dot-to-dots
[298.17s -> 304.83s]  Hidden objects where's Waldo coloring book section if you remember those magazines they were ridiculous
[305.35s -> 310.12s]  I want to have like a ask the editor section where people ask me things
[310.64s -> 312.64s]  It's gonna be a whole highlights magazine
[312.64s -> 320.18s]  Now this is sounds like it might be hard to do but it won't be it actually would probably pretty easy
[320.54s -> 325.30s]  so that where's Waldo idea sort of evolved into this and
[328.14s -> 331.08s]  I would say at some point next week
[331.52s -> 335.90s]  I'm gonna get some hard details down and we will have like submissions
[336.38s -> 339.94s]  For this stuff because I'm gonna do some stuff too
[339.94s -> 346.33s]  I want to I want to like hire out some people to make some crazy shit make a print
[346.33s -> 348.33s]  Yeah, I want it to be like an actual
[348.81s -> 353.50s]  Like book at least mine at least I want to do that on stream
[353.50s -> 355.50s]  But then it actually might be better if it was all digital
[355.50s -> 362.20s]  I'll come up with all the other the hard stuff here, but that will happen probably in the next few weeks
[362.20s -> 367.44s]  So I want to give at least a couple weeks for people to submit stuff. So next week we'll give some deadlines there
[367.96s -> 376.58s]  But that would be fun to do. There's like a jokes, but they had a joke section in highlights magazine
[376.58s -> 380.47s]  So I want I want you guys to submit your best jokes that I'm gonna read them on stream
[380.63s -> 392.68s]  It's just gonna be all copypastas more lifelines the minus two section
[394.84s -> 400.36s]  It's gonna be the same coffee pasta will there be a cereal stream
[400.36s -> 405.52s]  Um, I thought about the cereal strip, but his thing about a cereal stream
[406.04s -> 413.26s]  That's kind of it. You open up the boxes of cereal you eat the cereal and then what?
[413.76s -> 417.03s]  That's it. What are you? What am I?
[417.99s -> 422.46s]  That is like I would classify eating cereal on stream as
[423.69s -> 424.85s]  like
[424.85s -> 430.87s]  Let's say there's like a content layer content level from zero to a hundred. That's like a four
[433.11s -> 435.21s]  Sleeping on stream is probably like a two
[436.50s -> 438.88s]  Streaming a black screen is a one
[439.26s -> 445.87s]  You know I'm saying so that you're only like two or three notches over streaming a black screen with no with muted
[446.19s -> 455.28s]  So, I mean maybe I would it might be fun but I think that would I would want there to be a segment of a bigger stream
[457.85s -> 468.81s]  Zero is you're not live. Yeah, but anyways, we're gonna play streets of rogue, which is a rogue like a game
[469.33s -> 474.39s]  But it's also a kind of an adventure game too could be a bunch of other stuff
[474.39s -> 480.71s]  How would you know you've never played it neither of I what's a 100? Oh
[482.13s -> 488.01s]  Carnival stream that's I mean if you were to make a carnival with twitch controlled robots that play
[488.85s -> 495.57s]  Games on stream like at least at least like three four five of these games on stream and like clowns
[495.57s -> 505.48s]  I would say that would probably be somewhere around a hundred. I think that's my barometer
[506.08s -> 507.95s]  anyways
[507.95s -> 509.93s]  There's also a
[509.93s -> 521.58s]  There's also a twitch integration in this game. I have no idea how the hell this works, but let's see. Hey, there it is
[522.10s -> 523.98s]  streets of rogue
[523.98s -> 525.98s]  Kind of wanted to come back
[526.70s -> 528.70s]  soft today
[528.82s -> 532.08s]  Because obviously I I don't know how it I'm
[533.12s -> 538.06s]  Essentially, I've got a blindfold on I have no idea what's gonna happen with the internet
[538.06s -> 541.10s]  All I know is that it's on and I'm turning I turned it on and here we are
[541.10s -> 546.34s]  So there's no going back now unless they turn it off and then that case it's off and we went back
[546.42s -> 556.71s]  But that's kind of the the state of the update. Let's try it streets of rogue. Here we go
[556.83s -> 567.43s]  And the guy below me, why would I do that? I'll be green. We're green. I think I'm ready
[567.91s -> 573.02s]  Elected on vague promises of lower taxes more beer is true color things showed me the art
[573.02s -> 578.62s]  Okay, this is like the tutorial what happened before this?
[579.84s -> 582.92s]  Elected on vague promises of lower taxes and more beer
[583.08s -> 585.66s]  Okay
[585.66s -> 591.14s]  The whole camp the mayor's first executive order were a massive raise on taxes and a one-time confiscation of all
[591.70s -> 593.18s]  alcoholic beverages
[593.18s -> 601.50s]  He stated that the confiscation was so he could throw the mother of all ragers for his constituents
[601.78s -> 609.07s]  Okay, but in reality there was only like one keg and a bag of torture. I listen
[609.07s -> 614.51s]  I like this. Yeah, it's already a full letter grade. But in reality, there was only like one keg
[614.51s -> 622.34s]  I like that. It was super lame. All right now bring it back down full letter grade
[622.34s -> 623.10s]  I don't like this part
[623.10s -> 628.72s]  He used the money an extra boost to fund a private army of goons
[629.20s -> 635.31s]  Happy to carry out his every nefarious bidding before along the city had fallen into a state of chaos
[635.31s -> 639.60s]  But there is still hope a secretive organization
[639.80s -> 644.84s]  Organization known only as the resistance has been formed to fight back against the mayor's tyrannical leadership
[644.84s -> 648.81s]  And that is where our tale begins. It's time to embark on your journey into the
[650.39s -> 665.59s]  Streets of Rome, baby. So you want to join the resistance? Hey, well, there's something you should know our standards are for entry
[665.59s -> 669.70s]  I'm extremely hot. I'd offer where you've been hurt in my eyes. You know, that's very fair farm
[669.70s -> 677.64s]  The first task is move around use WASD. Holy crap. You did it. I'll open that door by pressing the E button
[678.04s -> 679.68s]  Which one II?
[679.68s -> 684.68s]  No way. No way. This is the farthest anyone's gotten in a long time
[684.68s -> 689.92s]  I left a little something for you in that chest. Can you figure out what to do next? This music's pretty good
[690.82s -> 692.10s]  II
[692.10s -> 697.94s]  Okay, so that's a lockpick pick any lock just don't expect the owner of said lock to appreciate it
[698.76s -> 703.11s]  Wow. Oh my god
[703.19s -> 709.55s]  Haha, but but there's no way that you could possibly figure out what to do with that thing. Oh
[713.35s -> 715.35s]  Haha. Oh god. I
[715.87s -> 717.23s]  got a
[717.23s -> 719.23s]  lock door here
[719.31s -> 721.31s]  Use lockpick just one
[721.39s -> 727.24s]  Whatever click it. Yeah. Holy crap. Holy crap
[727.84s -> 738.67s]  Why oh no, he spontaneously exploded
[738.67s -> 743.66s]  I'm so sorry you had to see that on the plus side you must be doing pretty well so far for him to get that
[743.66s -> 749.47s]  Excited he had a lot of emotional problems. Anyways, no use moping around. I'll take over from here
[749.99s -> 756.43s]  He's gonna explode too. Just watch I'm teleporting you some money use it to buy a hacking tool from our staff shopkeeper
[757.43s -> 761.77s]  50 bucks
[762.97s -> 768.98s]  Staff shopkeeper as you oops
[769.78s -> 771.78s]  What are you buying I'm buying
[772.46s -> 774.96s]  hacking tool
[775.48s -> 776.76s]  Jesus
[776.76s -> 779.32s]  Single-use device that will hack into any computer remotely
[780.04s -> 784.16s]  Okay, and he didn't explode. Oh, he will
[785.00s -> 787.82s]  Access your inventory by pressing Q
[788.14s -> 791.26s]  Then right click the hacking tool to select it and left click the computer
[791.90s -> 794.07s]  Which computer that one?
[794.27s -> 797.47s]  So right click to use and then click on the computer
[798.19s -> 800.50s]  Try to do from that far away
[800.62s -> 810.10s]  Open locked doors read email. That would be rude. Ah, you're right. It'll be pretty rude. Yeah, I don't do it
[810.70s -> 818.54s]  Try it again. Okay, open locked doors. I got it. Okay. Sorry. Good dad
[819.06s -> 822.82s]  This is as fast as I can move. What's E entrance?
[823.38s -> 825.18s]  Alright, so I'm at the computer
[825.18s -> 828.14s]  I'm gonna send you on a little trial mission to see what it is. Press tab
[829.82s -> 836.22s]  Destroy the generator which is up here. So I gotta go left up right up right down. Okay
[837.42s -> 841.58s]  Gonna send you a little trial. Let's see what to do. All right, Nick, what can I do anything go on the bathtub?
[842.30s -> 843.38s]  punch
[843.38s -> 848.45s]  Can I punch the computer? Yeah, but I don't want to break it
[849.17s -> 851.01s]  Should I break the bed?
[851.01s -> 856.95s]  Someone is on guard duty in the building past this fence to see more info hold space
[859.10s -> 863.22s]  Hostile, it looks like he won't be too happy to see you. And by the way, if someone's name is yellow
[863.38s -> 865.38s]  It means they own the property
[865.42s -> 872.46s]  I'm teleporting you a wall bypasser try using it in your toolbar press the number key that it corresponds to its log wall bypasser
[873.38s -> 877.46s]  What what tip?
[877.90s -> 882.06s]  Okay, typically a red door means people don't want you in there
[882.70s -> 888.20s]  Door do not enter. Okay, this is bouncer hostile
[888.96s -> 890.96s]  resistance later, alright, so
[891.00s -> 895.04s]  Just open the door and just kind of knock. Is there a knock on door?
[895.88s -> 901.28s]  Meet our staff bouncer. He'll be playing the part of bad guy, but he's been interested instructed not to fight back under any circumstance
[902.20s -> 907.18s]  Hello, nice to make your acquaintance rookie. Feel free to wail on him as hard as you can. He's a big guy. He can take it
[907.94s -> 911.58s]  Excuse me, but I don't recall agreeing to this when you sign your resistance paperwork
[911.58s -> 918.74s]  Perhaps you'll recall section 7c which states members are subject to any and all of the resistance leaders illogical dangerous and are sadistic whims
[919.62s -> 924.18s]  Look, you have no right to allow some random guy off the street to take shots at me for the sake of some what you call
[924.18s -> 925.86s]  It tutorial
[925.86s -> 928.38s]  We can do whatever we want to you. We're the ones in charge
[928.94s -> 933.06s]  You know, this is the same sort of ridiculous authoritarian crap the mayor pulls
[933.78s -> 936.58s]  Mayor that's the mayor stop being a wimp. You'll be fine
[936.74s -> 939.82s]  This piece is a double agent. We gave you that sweet hard hat. Remember?
[940.46s -> 942.46s]  fair enough
[942.46s -> 944.46s]  Grab that weapon wait
[947.41s -> 949.41s]  Baseball bat. Oh
[949.45s -> 950.81s]  damn
[950.81s -> 954.09s]  Grab that tranquilizer gun and cycle to it with mouse wheel. I
[955.61s -> 956.89s]  See, okay
[956.89s -> 965.68s]  How many do I have to shoot him with? I did way too many. I just over tranquilized him
[965.68s -> 968.04s]  I got the key to the base
[968.28s -> 975.52s]  Okay, do you see that blue meter at the top of your screen you'll get skill points for things like murdering and lockpicking, okay
[976.40s -> 980.43s]  Right like up here. All right
[980.47s -> 992.45s]  For murdering and what gets more points now walk through that red sensor is totally safe and not harmful at all. Teehee
[993.17s -> 1003.43s]  Bah ha ha ha. I'm sorry. I couldn't resist that never gets old. I hope you're okay. Take this bacon cheeseburger
[1003.43s -> 1006.99s]  You can quick use your health items by pressing F
[1007.95s -> 1010.92s]  Is it really why does it have to be a bacon cheeseburger?
[1014.29s -> 1017.65s]  Really? Didn't I talk shit about this like a few days ago?
[1018.49s -> 1021.82s]  Okay, take the bacon cheeseburger
[1021.90s -> 1028.24s]  Quick use your health by pressing F bacon cheeseburger. Oh just that was so epic
[1028.44s -> 1033.00s]  There's something you can use to deal with the lasers a little more safely. Just use it like you did the other weapons
[1033.56s -> 1035.98s]  What is it a rock? He's raw rocks people
[1037.00s -> 1039.89s]  Really?
[1039.89s -> 1042.73s]  Holy shit, I can throw rocks at people. All right, this game just got way better
[1043.41s -> 1053.99s]  You mean I'm wet. Why am I wet? I have no way to open this
[1055.85s -> 1060.13s]  I'm gonna give you a really cool special ability that you can use to teehee open the door to use it
[1060.13s -> 1061.81s]  Press the right mouse button

[1066.19s -> 1071.60s]  I call this the Waluigi scream the special ability that gave you was cry profusely
[1071.60s -> 1075.20s]  I mean, that's not very useful at all. Is it check out on your stats screen press R
[1076.24s -> 1083.96s]  Nobody liked the Waluigi scream. I thought like wait, wait, hold on
[1083.96s -> 1087.56s]  Maybe are we on the internet because I always thought that if you say the word Waluigi or do
[1087.88s -> 1091.52s]  W-A-H-H you automatically are way cooler of a person
[1092.44s -> 1094.36s]  Is that not cool anymore?
[1094.36s -> 1097.63s]  Well, all right. I'm gonna have to remember that
[1097.87s -> 1107.60s]  Damn. All right. Well, I apologize about that. I thought that I thought that Waluigi Wow was still like automatically
[1108.08s -> 1111.34s]  retweeted
[1112.26s -> 1116.14s]  Special ability where is it cry profusely cause you to cry like a little baby
[1116.86s -> 1120.46s]  Serves no purpose except to embarrass you. Okay. Well, I did get embarrassed
[1121.26s -> 1124.05s]  It worked it worked you working as intended
[1124.99s -> 1128.18s]  Here's a key. Oh, whoops

[1132.22s -> 1135.34s]  Then you can look at the entrance to teleport to the entrance. Oh, that's cool
[1136.22s -> 1147.71s]  Once you grab the key, you can quick teleport by pressing left control under normal circumstances. This will teleport you to important locations
[1148.47s -> 1151.78s]  All right
[1151.78s -> 1153.98s]  Destroy that generator to complete your mission. You got it

[6784.03s -> 6785.23s]  Come here
[6785.23s -> 6804.02s]  All right, I get
[6804.02s -> 6806.42s]  Oh god, what have I done? Wait, wait, I have an idea
[6811.65s -> 6813.65s]  It kind of worked it kind of worked
[6814.78s -> 6816.54s]  Can I kill the robot?
[6816.54s -> 6828.77s]  Okay, he's gonna hurt this money in these graves
[6829.33s -> 6838.53s]  Give me this money. Just keep doing this
[6838.61s -> 6849.62s]  shit
[6849.62s -> 6854.94s]  God damn it. I'm gonna die. I need heals
[6855.58s -> 6858.77s]  And maybe I want that money first though. He can't see me through walls, right?
[6864.35s -> 6868.19s]  He that's so much damage. He's hurting himself at 30 every time. It's not even close. I have to run
[6868.91s -> 6876.45s]  Oh shit
[6876.45s -> 6880.42s]  Um
[6880.42s -> 6883.15s]  I need to heal. I need to heal. I can't
[6885.07s -> 6887.07s]  Scientists kill it ghost
[6887.31s -> 6888.90s]  Friendly ghost
[6888.90s -> 6893.78s]  Can I add the ghost to my team? I don't think so. All right, I gotta go go go go go go go hurry up
[6894.50s -> 6903.47s]  soda machine
[6903.47s -> 6905.47s]  Oh, no, you got a gun
[6906.19s -> 6908.19s]  Oh fuck
[6909.31s -> 6911.63s]  Is the fucking robot no
[6913.06s -> 6916.66s]  Please
[6916.66s -> 6918.42s]  Oh, what do I do?
[6918.86s -> 6920.86s]  Where's the robot? He's right here
[6925.58s -> 6927.86s]  This is so stupid
[6927.86s -> 6929.86s]  I need to buy another banana
[6931.66s -> 6933.66s]  Why is he still chasing me?
[6934.59s -> 6936.75s]  You just blocked that you gotta be fucking kidding me
[6937.47s -> 6941.98s]  Fucking stupid like shop owner
[6952.74s -> 6957.70s]  Damn it
[6957.70s -> 6959.70s]  All right. Let's put on twitch integration. Let's see how it is
[6960.02s -> 6963.28s]  Let me make sure I have it set up right
[6963.36s -> 6965.36s]  I don't I have no idea what this is gonna do
[6965.44s -> 6969.10s]  But it should be on
[6969.10s -> 6974.59s]  What does it do?
[6974.59s -> 6976.30s]  like it
[6976.30s -> 6978.38s]  It's on it's apparently turned on
[6978.94s -> 6989.81s]  Let me do some traits. I'm gonna stay with the gorilla
[6992.74s -> 6994.50s]  blaster survivor
[6994.50s -> 6997.46s]  Explosions caused by the player don't damage the player. I like that
[7002.22s -> 7007.26s]  Thieving tools may not break after usage cause people you hit to be knocked back further. I don't like that
[7010.75s -> 7012.75s]  hiring people cost less
[7013.81s -> 7016.61s]  Saving crowds more nearby followers. You have to list damage you take
[7017.41s -> 7020.54s]  Health giving items will affect your nearby followers. That's kind of good
[7023.52s -> 7026.16s]  Can't hit people of your own class unless they are hostile
[7026.80s -> 7029.44s]  That's pretty good. All right. What about one of these two ones?
[7031.17s -> 7033.33s]  Followers will always travel to the next floor. All right, cool
[7036.22s -> 7037.82s]  So I I
[7037.82s -> 7040.14s]  It's apparently turned on. I don't know what commands you're gonna have
[7044.18s -> 7045.78s]  If it even is gonna work
[7045.78s -> 7046.90s]  We'll find out
[7046.90s -> 7053.54s]  Staying with the gorilla it lets us vote on stuff. Okay
[7054.18s -> 7058.45s]  Let me look at this again. I can't use projectiles. I can have three people
[7060.67s -> 7062.75s]  Knockback from damage is decreased
[7064.88s -> 7066.88s]  kill scientists
[7066.88s -> 7073.07s]  I can do the lunge and bananas give you more health. All right
[7074.98s -> 7078.99s]  Turn it on. It's not working
[7078.99s -> 7080.99s]  Well, I just I turned it on
[7081.50s -> 7087.84s]  nothing
[7087.84s -> 7091.12s]  Text at the bottom of the screen for twitch settings. Yes. Do I maybe have to reload again?
[7092.00s -> 7103.09s]  Maybe i'll reload again. It is on instead. Yeah, it's on in settings. I have like the token or everything
[7105.95s -> 7107.95s]  Everything. Yeah, everything's turned on for voting
[7109.38s -> 7111.94s]  Okay on right
[7112.26s -> 7118.26s]  Vote duration 30 seconds viewers choose traits on viewers choose levels disasters on viewers choose rewards on
[7119.30s -> 7125.81s]  That's fine, right?
[7125.97s -> 7127.49s]  leaked
[7127.49s -> 7129.01s]  Maybe it takes a minute
[7129.01s -> 7133.86s]  We'll see what happens. All right operate
[7135.62s -> 7150.70s]  Let's make this quick
[7150.70s -> 7153.36s]  You didn't tell me that it hurt me
[7153.36s -> 7157.31s]  Oh cheeseburger
[7157.31s -> 7164.96s]  Turn off all the lights in this person's house. What a mission and then we have to rescue this
[7165.76s -> 7167.20s]  office drone
[7167.20s -> 7175.47s]  Excuse me
[7175.47s -> 7190.18s]  Scientists extra experience from the scientists, right? All right, let's go. I can't speak english
[7193.76s -> 7194.72s]  uh
[7194.72s -> 7199.63s]  Okay, how do I tell him to follow me?
[7199.63s -> 7211.66s]  Wait
[7211.66s -> 7213.86s]  Not like that
[7213.86s -> 7215.86s]  He won't climb through the broken glass
[7221.04s -> 7223.04s]  Oh my god
[7223.28s -> 7237.47s]  We're dead. Just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. Kill me. It's not even worth it. Just kill me
[7237.47s -> 7240.22s]  Just do it. Just do it. Just do it. Start over
[7240.22s -> 7254.54s]  Damn it. I can't just fail the first mission. Let's go same deal. There is no
[7255.34s -> 7257.97s]  Okay, there's no uh gorilla here
[7263.73s -> 7265.57s]  scientist, yep
[7265.57s -> 7267.65s]  I'm oh look at all these scientists in here
[7268.29s -> 7270.45s]  They're all armed though
[7270.45s -> 7276.74s]  Not a good idea
[7276.82s -> 7280.27s]  They're in the trash pretty cool
[7280.27s -> 7288.83s]  What do I need to do up?
[7288.83s -> 7291.15s]  Treat the item in here. I can just climb through and get it and climb out
[7291.95s -> 7296.64s]  Let's do that blast
[7296.64s -> 7298.64s]  I need a melee weapon with this guy
[7298.88s -> 7307.01s]  Drug dealer clerk annoyed. Yeah clerks don't like it when I come in here
[7308.61s -> 7310.61s]  I'll fucking deal with it
[7324.64s -> 7328.86s]  Hold on I I can't shoot a gun but I can use a computer
[7329.58s -> 7331.41s]  How does that make any sense?
[7331.41s -> 7349.02s]  Come here. Come in. No, no, don't let him run away. Don't all right. Well, I don't care. You got away
[7349.42s -> 7355.60s]  Gorillas can use computers. Are you stupid?
[7358.02s -> 7360.02s]  You wouldn't got a friend
[7360.64s -> 7365.63s]  Give me this
[7365.63s -> 7370.50s]  Gorilla is hard
[7370.50s -> 7372.74s]  Okay, I gotta get over here
[7376.96s -> 7380.99s]  Got the baseball

[7388.16s -> 7391.66s]  How do you do this?
[7391.66s -> 7393.34s]  Do I get to vote too?
[7393.34s -> 7394.99s]  Give me the sword
[7394.99s -> 7402.86s]  Don't give me the grenade. I can't use the grenade

[7417.95s -> 7428.26s]  23 bucks
[7428.26s -> 7438.66s]  Uh, I gotta go up just get me out of here
[7439.22s -> 7442.59s]  Nothing else, right? Nope
[7442.59s -> 7444.59s]  ATM can I break the ATM?
[7445.15s -> 7453.65s]  Will I get money from the ATM? No. Yeah, you're in you're in yeah
[7455.52s -> 7457.52s]  My fate is in your hands
[7457.52s -> 7459.52s]  So, please be nice to me
[7460.16s -> 7466.48s]  Shit, i'm not doing that. Why would I do that? Wait, do I have to do that?

[7470.10s -> 7481.55s]  Can we get hit by the fire? Oh shit
[7482.43s -> 7486.59s]  Up is down and down is up
[7486.75s -> 7488.75s]  No, I can't
[7488.83s -> 7490.51s]  I can't control this
[7490.51s -> 7492.51s]  I have to hold up to go down
[7492.59s -> 7505.31s]  How long does it?
[7505.31s -> 7510.75s]  Do you have no idea how fucking hard that was to do? It's still the other
[7513.38s -> 7515.70s]  When does it stop? Oh my god. Thank goodness
[7522.30s -> 7526.30s]  Even swinging in this direction swung it over in that direction. That was horrible
[7526.86s -> 7528.40s]  Okay
[7528.40s -> 7530.67s]  I got everything I need
[7530.67s -> 7534.78s]  Let's move. I'm not doing the generator. No reason to just go
[7535.66s -> 7540.58s]  No gorillas on this level either
[7546.82s -> 7551.01s]  Choose a trait
[7551.01s -> 7552.77s]  Okay. I'll let you see what they do
[7552.77s -> 7554.77s]  And he's more likely to run away
[7555.02s -> 7558.62s]  Followers gain extra health and receive money at the start of every new floor
[7560.58s -> 7562.58s]  Why did I know everyone was gonna pick this one?
[7565.68s -> 7567.68s]  Oh, I didn't muck her ass. She's ugly
[7576.59s -> 7578.83s]  All right. So, uh people run away
[7584.80s -> 7588.16s]  One person said that one guy said that and you're still holding on to it
[7588.80s -> 7591.30s]  All right, kill doctor get lockpick
[7592.99s -> 7596.67s]  Get the hard drive from the gangster and turn off all the switches
[7597.71s -> 7598.75s]  Okay
[7598.75s -> 7605.52s]  What do I got here? Banana peel. Oh, that's cool
[7608.05s -> 7609.49s]  food
[7609.49s -> 7610.69s]  Sell that
[7610.69s -> 7615.76s]  Put the rock on here. All right, so I can make it send your opponent stone a trip to the ground
[7616.56s -> 7621.71s]  How does this work?
[7621.71s -> 7623.71s]  Now that's what the other gorilla was using
[7624.42s -> 7628.74s]  right
[7628.74s -> 7632.83s]  i'm gonna buy a banana
[7632.91s -> 7634.03s]  and
[7634.03s -> 7640.29s]  Should I clone myself? I don't have enough money. Never mind. There's a mission up there, too
[7641.09s -> 7642.85s]  No gorillas to free
[7642.85s -> 7644.96s]  Let's go do it
[7644.96s -> 7650.08s]  What do you got?
[7650.08s -> 7653.76s]  Uh free slave get five nuggets. Okay, it's down at the bottom
[7654.40s -> 7673.52s]  Out here. It's down this way
[7674.08s -> 7678.13s]  What are you doing? What are you? What are you? What are we freaking out?
[7679.87s -> 7681.87s]  What is what is what are we freaking out? What's going on here?
[7691.58s -> 7693.10s]  What what is this?
[7693.10s -> 7705.70s]  What the what the fuck is this?
[7705.78s -> 7712.50s]  Accomplished in 87 what we released this for the most accomplished. Why did somebody make this?
[7713.06s -> 7715.06s]  We released this for
[7716.24s -> 7722.24s]  That's fucking terrifying. I told you I told you guys I told you this like a year ago
[7722.80s -> 7728.24s]  Eventually, you're gonna be they're gonna get you can say anything. They'll get you to say anything. They'll get your face on shit
[7729.04s -> 7734.64s]  There's no there's no such thing as authenticity anymore and another five years. This technology will be perfected
[7735.20s -> 7737.92s]  You're most accomplished. How did you do this?
[7741.76s -> 7743.82s]  I'm gonna show this
[7743.82s -> 7749.26s]  Because this is absolutely outrageous. That's me on the screen. Like I was in this scene had to open
[7758.32s -> 7764.42s]  Hold on. We've released this for the most accomplished. If 87 we've released this
[7766.98s -> 7772.50s]  If 87 we've released this for the most accomplished if 87
[7772.98s -> 7780.50s]  You we've released this for the most accomplished in 87 you we've released this for the most accomplished
[7781.06s -> 7785.14s]  In 87 you we've released this for the most accomplished
[7786.18s -> 7789.86s]  I hate this we've released this for the most accomplished
[7790.74s -> 7798.34s]  computers
[7798.34s -> 7800.29s]  aren't
[7800.29s -> 7802.69s]  See, I see it in fucking like 100 years
[7804.69s -> 7808.05s]  When like we will we're not going to be under control by the machines
[7808.69s -> 7813.44s]  Someone will come up with some algorithm that replaces human brains and we're just it's over
[7814.08s -> 7824.38s]  I don't know how you make something like that
[7829.63s -> 7831.63s]  Yeah, and that's like the third or fourth time that's happened
[7832.77s -> 7836.61s]  Some of you guys are getting really good at this like uh, do you eat ass like yes, of course I do
[7836.69s -> 7838.75s]  I've seen that before
[7838.75s -> 7840.99s]  Some of you guys are getting really good at this. I just want to be dabbing
[7842.56s -> 7848.40s]  Also, uh another great thing about the oh you can your face can be put on anything. I could just deny anything ever
[7851.06s -> 7855.86s]  Like i've that's never i've never done that I can deny it because look you just see how good the fakes are
[7856.66s -> 7863.17s]  It's easy to deny to deny everything though. Okay. I got to how do I get you out of here?
[7865.17s -> 7872.11s]  Do I have to kill the guards?
[7872.11s -> 7875.31s]  Hey, you got that was like a joke that that was the equipment. Come on
[7877.42s -> 7894.16s]  You're gonna stab me over a joke. All right, i'll take the axe for sure. All right. Did you get out? Did you go?
[7894.64s -> 7896.64s]  I didn't kill the guy accidentally, right?
[7896.64s -> 7903.28s]  No, i'm good in 87
[7903.76s -> 7915.65s]  Wait, where's this? Oh, he's up here out of the way I will take the chicken nuggets. Thank you
[7916.61s -> 7923.68s]  Huey louis. All right, so that I should be able to retrieve the items break through the door
[7924.24s -> 7936.86s]  No, it shouldn't be too hard though. Why don't you break free like
[7941.07s -> 7943.39s]  Oh should you you guys have to pick every reward I get
[7944.11s -> 7946.86s]  Free item mini fridge, which makes food better
[7947.82s -> 7954.38s]  Uh shuriken people generally dislike when you plant these in their faces or has literally nothing to do with smaller rodents
[7954.38s -> 7957.02s]  But does increase your chance of scoring a crit by 100 percent
[7958.06s -> 7966.85s]  Why would somebody deep fake me onto that? I still can't get over that
[7969.74s -> 7973.34s]  Can you deep fake me onto willy wonka when he does the pure imagination song?
[7975.98s -> 7977.34s]  Somebody get on that
[7977.34s -> 7986.13s]  How long would that take would that take like two quantum computers to get that done in like the next couple hours?
[7986.85s -> 8002.91s]  I'm not talking the whole scene. All right, we gotta go on with that chest
[8003.47s -> 8009.66s]  easy
[8009.66s -> 8011.84s]  And a burger dropped good within the chest
[8013.39s -> 8014.75s]  Something to sell
[8014.75s -> 8015.79s]  good
[8015.79s -> 8021.25s]  No gorillas, right? Nope
[8021.33s -> 8026.05s]  Really good and well-trained deep fakes can render entire scene in about two days
[8030.08s -> 8037.18s]  That's not worth it that's not worth it upgrade trait
[8037.90s -> 8039.90s]  Oh, that's way too much money
[8043.60s -> 8046.40s]  That's some
[8046.40s -> 8048.66s]  Oh my god
[8048.66s -> 8050.42s]  Neutralize the doctor
[8050.42s -> 8054.10s]  Of course, let's turn off these switches get out of here. Oh, okay. I'm getting out i'm leaving
[8064.83s -> 8075.68s]  Key to the bank watch the full deep fake what hold on
[8076.62s -> 8079.17s]  What do you mean the full?
[8079.17s -> 8085.46s]  deep fake
[8085.46s -> 8087.55s]  Somebody did the whole scene
[8087.55s -> 8090.58s]  No, they didn't
[8090.58s -> 8092.58s]  Why?
[8092.98s -> 8099.41s]  What?
[8099.41s -> 8101.97s]  Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me
[8113.79s -> 8115.07s]  What?
[8115.07s -> 8123.01s]  Wait, let me see this
[8132.58s -> 8134.18s]  Why
[8134.18s -> 8136.18s]  Why did you make this?
[8137.63s -> 8141.63s]  I don't have any reason for you for anybody to have made this
[8143.46s -> 8151.17s]  I we have to watch this i'm putting it on screen
[8153.46s -> 8155.46s]  all right, so spoilers for um
[8156.58s -> 8158.42s]  american psycho if you've ever seen that movie before
[8159.89s -> 8161.09s]  and uh

[8175.76s -> 8177.76s]  You like huy lewis on the news
[8178.86s -> 8180.14s]  They're okay
[8180.14s -> 8185.20s]  Their early work was a little too that's not me for my taste
[8186.19s -> 8188.19s]  When sports came out in 83
[8188.35s -> 8197.26s]  That's not is that me that's not me artistically the whole album has a clear crisp sound
[8197.58s -> 8202.78s]  And a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost
[8203.34s -> 8205.34s]  I can't tell
[8213.12s -> 8218.80s]  He's been compared to elvis costello, but I think huy has a far more bitter cynical sense of humor
[8219.52s -> 8225.15s]  Oh, yeah, we're straight up. Yes, alan. Why are the copies of the style section of a play do you?
[8226.03s -> 8233.63s]  Have a dog a little chow or something no alan is that a raincoat yes it is
[8235.58s -> 8237.58s]  In 87
[8283.06s -> 8285.06s]  What what is he saying
[8286.10s -> 8291.15s]  What is it saying?
[8291.23s -> 8293.23s]  What is it saying except to fuck you
[8301.78s -> 8304.02s]  Uh, okay. I looked over it and somebody said
[8305.30s -> 8308.34s]  Major tos warning and i'm like, what are you talking about?
[8308.74s -> 8314.02s]  Oh, right when he uh brutally murders this guy with a fucking axe on camera. Oh, right. Yeah
[8314.90s -> 8334.69s]  That part I forgot about that. Okay, it's not real
[8335.49s -> 8338.88s]  Yeah
[8338.88s -> 8342.72s]  It's cool if it's a video game not if it's a movie. I don't make the rules
[8343.36s -> 8348.53s]  Hold on. Let me see this
[8348.53s -> 8359.39s]  Where did it go? What is this?
[8363.39s -> 8372.10s]  This is so fucked up
[8375.04s -> 8377.04s]  It this is ridiculous
[8377.60s -> 8407.23s]  I couldn't tell if it was christian bale of my face. It was too weird. We'll get we're going to down paths
[8407.71s -> 8409.71s]  That we never should have gone down
[8412.10s -> 8415.42s]  Let me tell you a story. Okay, i'll tell you a story
[8418.45s -> 8421.90s]  Um, i'm gonna put this on screen and i'm gonna tell you a little story
[8424.96s -> 8438.32s]  Give me one second because it needs to be said
[8444.19s -> 8446.86s]  You're like huy lewis on the news. Okay, so
[8448.42s -> 8451.46s]  What was supposed to be
[8451.46s -> 8453.50s]  What was supposed to be?
[8453.50s -> 8455.34s]  like 50k
[8455.34s -> 8459.58s]  on a computer
[8459.58s -> 8461.49s]  has turned into
[8461.49s -> 8466.53s]  People doing this shit for fun. You were only supposed to send an email to somebody once a day
[8467.41s -> 8473.47s]  You understand?
[8473.47s -> 8479.87s]  Once a day you were supposed to send an email or maybe receive the equivalent of a fucking text from your mother
[8486.80s -> 8492.83s]  You know what i'm saying? Not much of a story but more of an observation
[8496.46s -> 8498.46s]  That's like my hair
[8506.96s -> 8509.20s]  All right. Wait a second freeze that
[8517.94s -> 8534.32s]  We have to do this because I need to see if this is for real. Hold on. Can I pause this without
[8543.33s -> 8550.34s]  This out of the way
[8550.34s -> 8559.54s]  Fuck it is
[8559.54s -> 8570.51s]  Why is it exactly the same? It's just a little like it's a little cleaner. Hold on. I can I can flip it wait
[8574.51s -> 8610.77s]  Let me flip this
[8610.77s -> 8630.22s]  I can't I this is too weird for me. Don't look at that. All right, i've had enough
[8646.80s -> 8648.96s]  It's hard to even process that that's even possible
[8649.20s -> 8655.89s]  Remember when gps was a big deal when you had the thing that told you directions
[8657.92s -> 8658.88s]  Wow
[8658.88s -> 8665.28s]  Just technology it tells you how to get to the person's house. I'm going to pretend that you were in this movie killing somebody
[8665.28s -> 8667.90s]  No, what happens next?
[8682.58s -> 8689.94s]  Skynet. Well, that was a good little uh intermission there. I think let's get back to the game
[8692.03s -> 8694.19s]  Face cam so we have more footage to use
[8696.24s -> 8699.28s]  No, I don't do face cam. I only do face cam like once a month
[8709.49s -> 8714.13s]  No, I I was in front of a green screen for like six hours you can't pull some of that
[8715.01s -> 8730.30s]  Let me just be the gorilla. Hold on. I gotta get in there. I'm never gonna turn my face cam on again
[8730.86s -> 8733.25s]  Someone will use it
[8733.25s -> 8735.74s]  Someone will use it somewhere without my permission
[8736.30s -> 8748.26s]  That was it. That's all that was in there
[8748.26s -> 8750.26s]  Turret turret. What do I do about that?
[8750.82s -> 8753.38s]  I had to go the other way
[8753.38s -> 8770.66s]  So you let a goon?
[8770.66s -> 8776.50s]  61 dollars pretty good the turret only shoots if the camera sees you that's good to know
[8777.06s -> 8779.62s]  I want to at least get to like level five
[8779.70s -> 8785.31s]  Am I ever gonna be able to do this?
[8785.31s -> 8787.71s]  Syringe in a trash can I wouldn't pick that up if I were you
[8790.21s -> 8800.30s]  Um, that's all right. This is gonna be hard to do
[8800.94s -> 8804.03s]  I'm gonna have to break a door
[8804.03s -> 8806.02s]  climb through a window or
[8806.02s -> 8808.02s]  Because nobody wants the gorilla in the store, right?
[8809.68s -> 8811.68s]  Maybe if I can just go right through
[8812.00s -> 8818.18s]  Wait, is the cop gonna see that?
[8818.18s -> 8828.80s]  Sometimes you gotta just go for it. You just do let's go
[8831.17s -> 8832.21s]  new
[8832.21s -> 8836.02s]  Floor here we go. Give me something good guys, please
[8836.58s -> 8839.26s]  please
[8839.26s -> 8843.26s]  Followers will always follow you to the next floor. Maybe weapons can destroy walls
[8844.22s -> 8847.34s]  Or items in shop costs less, but I can't talk
[8848.14s -> 8851.50s]  So that's not gonna help me
[8851.50s -> 8859.55s]  Choose wisely
[8859.55s -> 8861.55s]  Three is 100% useless, right?
[8862.03s -> 8871.74s]  What was that? Oh, I get two
[8872.30s -> 8878.59s]  Hey, wait, wait, wait, slow slow slow slow slow down slow down. Which terrifying disaster should befall your poor streamer in the next level?
[8879.23s -> 8883.31s]  Bombs are falling from the sky a bounty is on the player's head. So random people will attack
[8883.79s -> 8890.64s]  Or a killer robot. No, don't do the killer robot. That's guaranteed. It runs over do like bombs dropping
[8890.64s -> 8892.64s]  That's like funny yellow bell moment, right? Come on
[8898.88s -> 8901.31s]  Really? This one sucks
[8901.79s -> 8907.92s]  This one actually sucks. I'm probably gonna lose i'm just gonna go to the end of the level as fast as I can
[8908.80s -> 8912.80s]  Any gorillas on here? There are two gorillas. Great. I need to i'm not gonna be able to do this

[9035.52s -> 9038.32s]  Oh shit. Oh shit. I'm in trouble. This is bad
[9048.03s -> 9054.56s]  Shoot it. Oh my god. I'm just trying to

[9417.02s -> 9419.26s]  Recruit up to three followers
[9419.74s -> 9423.10s]  Okay
[9423.10s -> 9429.10s]  Wipe out every last blood that you come across and ensure permanent crave dominance. All right, I guess let's try
[9435.66s -> 9439.74s]  There are five that are here so I need to how do I recruit people? All right, we need to
[9440.46s -> 9457.18s]  Double kill good just talk to the blue guys. Okay
[9462.02s -> 9471.06s]  Uh bribe with item threatened. Okay. I'll take the combination
[9474.86s -> 9477.10s]  Um, i'm gonna use the key and we'll use the combination
[9478.40s -> 9481.20s]  39 bucks not bad so far. Okay, this is not bad not terrible
[9482.00s -> 9484.37s]  Are these blue guys?
[9484.37s -> 9488.27s]  Do these count as uh, how do you guys get out of here?
[9494.85s -> 9497.07s]  buy from shop
[9497.07s -> 9500.82s]  drugs
[9500.82s -> 9502.72s]  No
[9502.72s -> 9504.48s]  I gotta get through here
[9504.48s -> 9509.98s]  Any more of those, uh red guys?
[9516.22s -> 9518.22s]  Oh, oh, oh i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming
[9519.65s -> 9521.65s]  Oh, you killed him. Uh, oh
[9522.45s -> 9545.82s]  I hit every single attack every single one. That's gotta say something. I'm not sure what that's supposed to say, but it
[9546.70s -> 9549.60s]  Not very much. I guess
[9549.60s -> 9552.88s]  The game has auto aim. Yeah, I knew someone was gonna take it from me
[9554.75s -> 9556.75s]  Somebody was gonna take it from me. I knew they were
[9557.15s -> 9562.19s]  Through here
[9564.11s -> 9567.57s]  No pressure plates good
[9567.57s -> 9571.46s]  What happened to this guy?
[9571.46s -> 9577.18s]  Oh burnt
[9577.18s -> 9579.02s]  10 not
[9579.02s -> 9580.38s]  Why is there a timer?
[9580.38s -> 9583.28s]  Do they all turn back on?
[9583.28s -> 9584.16s]  wait
[9584.16s -> 9586.16s]  three two one
[9589.01s -> 9600.82s]  What I it's all right. It's not the main mission. It's fine
[9601.71s -> 9604.83s]  What?
[9604.83s -> 9606.83s]  I I didn't know that. All right
[9610.00s -> 9624.30s]  I thought that I was gonna turn them all back on again. I do have the cell phone which recruits people, right?
[9629.31s -> 9635.31s]  Uh doing bar fills more quickly easier to knock people through walls and you can't hit people you are aligned with
[9636.11s -> 9639.71s]  I think that's a really good one. If I were in the chat right now, I would be pressing three
[9642.70s -> 9645.02s]  That's if I was in the chat
[9645.02s -> 9648.10s]  If I was streaming the game
[9648.10s -> 9650.18s]  I wouldn't have to say because uh, you were in the chair
[9650.74s -> 9654.35s]  Stop me
[9654.35s -> 9656.35s]  Yeah, I mean come on that that's perfect. That is
[9657.22s -> 9668.14s]  Everything we're looking for nice. All right. So now
[9669.26s -> 9671.25s]  Let's go
[9671.33s -> 9672.37s]  Any
[9672.37s -> 9674.37s]  There are three red
[9674.69s -> 9677.01s]  Team members here destroy everything neutralize. All right
[9680.13s -> 9682.13s]  There's a red team member right there
[9682.93s -> 9689.89s]  Leave a gun or a knife
[9689.89s -> 9696.99s]  I don't know how I hit you through the wall. I really don't understand that. All right
[9697.87s -> 9704.19s]  two more
[9704.19s -> 9706.35s]  Destroy that mission in here
[9707.07s -> 9718.85s]  Let's just check it out retrieve the muffin from the bartender
[9719.49s -> 9721.49s]  Sure thing and i'm gonna recruit you
[9722.72s -> 9724.72s]  Join me both of you
[9725.04s -> 9728.00s]  That's what i'm talking about
[9728.00s -> 9731.26s]  So we're gonna get the muffin from the bartender
[9731.66s -> 9744.99s]  Should be easy with three of us. Let's go this way. I did kind of just go the long way, but it's all right
[9746.98s -> 9749.18s]  Hello
[9749.18s -> 9752.48s]  Threatened 65 chance take it don't hurt me
[9753.12s -> 9756.06s]  Worked did it work?
[9756.46s -> 9760.94s]  Do I have it? Okay, I got it
[9762.62s -> 9765.65s]  Uh, there's a chest in here though. Should I get it?
[9774.29s -> 9779.28s]  Not worth it. Let's turn this in
[9780.59s -> 9782.83s]  How many chicken nugget points do I have now? Probably a lot
[9784.27s -> 9786.59s]  At least like 30 or 40 right after this
[9795.58s -> 9799.23s]  German by beer
[9799.23s -> 9800.27s]  uh
[9800.27s -> 9802.70s]  How do I destroy it? I'm gonna do that last
[9802.86s -> 9806.00s]  That's gonna cause the most chaos

[14347.35s -> 14353.16s]  We're good. Didn't lose anybody. Did I?
[14353.56s -> 14355.73s]  You shouldn't come in here. I you came that was
[14356.77s -> 14358.77s]  Just leave leave leave leave leave him leave him. Look
[14359.09s -> 14369.84s]  How am I good? How am I good today?
[14369.84s -> 14371.84s]  How am I doing today? I'm good
[14371.92s -> 14373.44s]  I'm doing pretty well
[14373.44s -> 14377.40s]  How about you? You doing good?
[14379.24s -> 14397.08s]  Ow damn it that hurt a lot. Give me the key. Give me the key
[14403.27s -> 14414.74s]  You made amazing roasted potatoes
[14417.36s -> 14419.36s]  I haven't had roasted potatoes in a long time
[14419.52s -> 14425.73s]  I know that sounds really strange for someone to say that
[14427.36s -> 14429.36s]  But I don't I've never had
[14430.50s -> 14434.34s]  It's been probably like a few months since i've had roasted potatoes in the oven
[14434.98s -> 14448.90s]  It's not something I really make or eat, but I will take this lecture. Let's try it
[14450.10s -> 14452.10s]  Oh, I can't break these walls
[14453.88s -> 14456.04s]  Uh, I gotta go over here to the thief
[14459.35s -> 14460.87s]  Take the horn out
[14460.87s -> 14475.27s]  Can I like horn over here and have it blow up? This is just a noise maker after god
[14476.52s -> 14477.48s]  Oh
[14477.48s -> 14482.92s]  God damn it the stupid thing. I'm so stupid. I just have tunnel vision and look straight ahead
[14485.32s -> 14488.72s]  every time
[14488.72s -> 14490.24s]  And now
[14490.24s -> 14499.89s]  I can't even get over there
[14499.89s -> 14505.08s]  This sucks
[14508.08s -> 14529.92s]  Go that hurts a lot. Remember you are very smart
[14530.48s -> 14543.36s]  Hey, thanks
[14543.36s -> 14550.58s]  Hurt him
[14550.58s -> 14554.74s]  Fake message. That's fine. All right, let me get out
[14559.52s -> 14561.52s]  I don't care. It's gonna be five dollars. You all know it
[14562.48s -> 14567.59s]  I think something good
[14567.59s -> 14568.55s]  Ooh
[14568.55s -> 14575.14s]  I wonder how much that compounds on top
[14580.34s -> 14582.58s]  Either one of these are good
[14582.58s -> 14584.58s]  All three of them worth picking
[14584.58s -> 14601.22s]  three followers
[14601.22s -> 14604.85s]  Oh, no, oh do this right do this right
[14607.41s -> 14611.65s]  Shifting status effects players and npcs get new status effects every 10 seconds or ooze
[14624.53s -> 14626.77s]  Lots of riders are causing chaos in the street
[14628.68s -> 14630.68s]  Might need to use the phone on this one
[14634.15s -> 14641.30s]  Maybe it'll just run to the end
[14641.30s -> 14643.76s]  There are seven
[14643.76s -> 14646.26s]  Of them really?
[14647.59s -> 14649.67s]  Riot riot riot riot
[14664.26s -> 14666.44s]  Good. Let's give me the money
[14666.44s -> 14668.20s]  All right. I need to uh
[14668.20s -> 14675.33s]  Go get the crate. Come here. No, no, no, no, no down here down here. Where you going?
[14676.13s -> 14680.00s]  Follow me

[14697.08s -> 14699.64s]  Stop running away. Get over here. No
[14702.28s -> 14703.67s]  Whatever
[14703.67s -> 14705.03s]  It's fine
[14705.11s -> 14710.02s]  Just got your rass kick
[14710.02s -> 14712.32s]  I'm coming in clean it up. Don't worry
[14712.64s -> 14715.01s]  Papa Jeremy's got it under control
[14715.65s -> 14724.98s]  I got some stuff. I think I want to sell here banana field don't want to take enough inventory space
[14726.72s -> 14728.72s]  these syringes, um
[14729.60s -> 14733.51s]  Get rid of the baseball bat don't need it
[14734.72s -> 14748.44s]  Okay, come here tom. I'm trying to get you to follow me around and you just keep whatever
[14749.16s -> 14752.55s]  We're on the same damn team. Anyways, who cares?
[14753.35s -> 14764.98s]  straight ahead
[14764.98s -> 14766.98s]  In this labyrinth here
[14767.46s -> 14776.16s]  I got the axe
[14776.16s -> 14777.94s]  wrench
[14777.94s -> 14779.94s]  Why did I hit the cop for that was stupid?
[14789.49s -> 14799.17s]  All right, can we relax gotta get in there?
[14806.45s -> 14811.81s]  Yeah the fuck away from me
[14811.81s -> 14814.87s]  Oh, no, the drug dealer is dead
[14817.17s -> 14819.09s]  I'm gonna take one of these syringes
[14819.09s -> 14828.18s]  That's why I should sell all of them. I just went in a full circle
[14828.74s -> 14832.15s]  How do I get in here?
[14832.15s -> 14833.51s]  All the way down here
[14833.51s -> 14841.14s]  How do I miss this?
[14841.14s -> 14843.14s]  Oh, that's like in a weird spot
[14845.48s -> 14847.48s]  Don't touch that. It's a pressure plate
[14853.22s -> 14855.22s]  Yeah
[14856.10s -> 14858.10s]  I deserve that. Oh, well
[14858.50s -> 14872.36s]  Damn it. I deserve that. Can't even pick up the cigarette. Can I again? I need an ammo crate
[14880.18s -> 14881.92s]  Hmm
[14881.92s -> 14897.48s]  I don't know
[14897.48s -> 14901.59s]  Killer thrower
[14901.59s -> 14908.20s]  Seems like that's going to be the one
[14908.20s -> 14910.20s]  Did you use the item voucher from last run?
[14911.14s -> 14913.14s]  Uh, yeah, I think so
[14913.46s -> 14915.46s]  Remember I got the underwear
[14919.57s -> 14921.81s]  So that's it need two more. Where are they?
[14922.77s -> 14924.77s]  Oh, they're all the way down here. Really? Come on
[14925.01s -> 14936.08s]  What's that? No bartender dead
[14945.67s -> 14947.67s]  All right, let's do this
[14947.67s -> 14954.90s]  Did you say I think you stink?
[14956.64s -> 14958.16s]  I think you stink
[14958.16s -> 14963.16s]  Where's the last one over here?
[14968.93s -> 14971.75s]  I do not stink. I can promise you that
[14974.02s -> 14976.02s]  Come on, let me pac-man this guy damn it
[14976.64s -> 14984.13s]  Pac-man kill him
[14984.13s -> 14985.73s]  God damn it
[14985.73s -> 14987.49s]  Get over here
[14987.49s -> 14989.49s]  No, please
[14995.78s -> 15009.46s]  Somebody took a syringe and became invisible
[15011.46s -> 15012.82s]  Where are they?
[15012.82s -> 15014.66s]  All right. I'm out. Goodbye

[15034.42s -> 15035.94s]  Just leave
[15035.94s -> 15037.54s]  No, not yet. Hold on
[15037.54s -> 15043.14s]  Somebody drop food
[15043.14s -> 15044.66s]  Help me up here, please
[15044.66s -> 15051.06s]  All right. Fuck it. Just leave. Okay guys this food available. Give it to me
[15065.16s -> 15066.76s]  Any food bad
[15066.76s -> 15069.16s]  I have plenty of money
[15069.16s -> 15072.32s]  There's nobody there. Just gotta do the two missions and get out
[15075.24s -> 15077.96s]  There is a level up soon. You're right. You're right. You're right. I should probably calm down
[15087.14s -> 15091.62s]  Can I wait? Can I use the wrench on this and make it so it doesn't do anything?
[15092.74s -> 15094.42s]  Can I just say
[15094.42s -> 15101.83s]  I feel like that would work
[15101.83s -> 15104.82s]  Can I do that?
[15104.82s -> 15106.61s]  Yes, right
[15106.61s -> 15107.81s]  Yes, you can
[15107.81s -> 15116.47s]  Oh god
[15116.47s -> 15141.17s]  I don't know what to do. I'm stuck. I have no idea what i'm gonna do. Oh, okay. I'm fine
[15141.25s -> 15143.81s]  Oh, thank god. I leveled up. Holy shit. That was horrible
[15144.77s -> 15159.41s]  Safe combination to get it
[15159.41s -> 15165.32s]  Well, i'm not gonna use this right now
[15165.96s -> 15168.52s]  I'm thinking I just sell that that's gonna kill me
[15169.32s -> 15173.80s]  I'm actually gonna die from that. I can probably guarantee it
[15180.44s -> 15182.44s]  You suck, but I like this stream
[15182.68s -> 15184.68s]  Well, thank hey, thanks
[15184.76s -> 15186.76s]  I appreciate that
[15187.08s -> 15192.20s]  Glad you like the stream welcome
[15192.44s -> 15194.52s]  If you like what you see
[15194.52s -> 15198.04s]  Then let's hang out
[15198.20s -> 15200.20s]  Not in real life. I mean just like here
[15201.32s -> 15204.26s]  I unlocked the shopkeeper
[15204.26s -> 15216.69s]  I finally got some more weapons. I feel safe now
[15219.72s -> 15221.56s]  Keep the baseball bat. All right
[15221.56s -> 15223.56s]  Now we gotta do uh over here
[15225.01s -> 15227.41s]  Get that worker
[15227.41s -> 15229.41s]  You know, I do want you
[15229.81s -> 15231.81s]  Come from the door, please
[15233.56s -> 15235.32s]  More bullshit over here
[15235.32s -> 15239.14s]  Of course
[15239.14s -> 15244.40s]  Can I come over? You're already here
[15244.40s -> 15249.06s]  You're already here
[15249.06s -> 15250.58s]  Just stay
[15250.58s -> 15256.32s]  You're just a free kill to whoever is over here
[15262.68s -> 15266.58s]  How do I do this without?
[15266.58s -> 15269.01s]  Um, how am I gonna do this?
[15271.60s -> 15272.96s]  I'm gonna blow it up
[15272.96s -> 15276.08s]  I can't open this
[15276.08s -> 15277.20s]  Stand back
[15277.20s -> 15290.56s]  You asshole just get out here
[15290.64s -> 15292.71s]  Good didn't have to blow it up
[15292.71s -> 15302.64s]  Out all these are pretty good except I don't use the door detonators
[15303.20s -> 15325.09s]  ever
[15325.09s -> 15326.77s]  hmm
[15326.77s -> 15328.77s]  Mini fridge is probably the best
[15329.24s -> 15334.29s]  That'll help me because then food will be more filling
[15335.88s -> 15342.69s]  That's it. I'm out
[15342.69s -> 15344.69s]  You idiot not you me
[15345.65s -> 15351.44s]  Let's get out
[15351.52s -> 15355.36s]  Nobody else is on this floor. What about wait? Hold on. I think there's a cell machine over here
[15357.88s -> 15359.88s]  All right, let me sell
[15360.04s -> 15363.22s]  This knife is worthless
[15363.22s -> 15365.46s]  I'm selling the syringes. I'm not going to use them
[15366.26s -> 15369.36s]  I haven't even what about the boombox? I've never even turned it on
[15370.08s -> 15382.34s]  I think i'm good
[15382.34s -> 15385.30s]  Sell the killer thrower. I feel like I could use that pretty well somewhere
[15388.07s -> 15391.91s]  Hitting walls and objects doesn't make any sound can't hit people of your own class
[15392.47s -> 15394.95s]  And can't hit most people you are aligned with
[15395.91s -> 15406.98s]  Good stuff. Oh those of you that weren't here tomorrow
[15407.62s -> 15410.12s]  Tomorrow, we're gonna do a comb stream
[15411.57s -> 15413.09s]  That's right
[15413.09s -> 15415.52s]  We're gonna do tier lists
[15415.60s -> 15417.86s]  flash games
[15417.86s -> 15419.70s]  And some other just bullshit
[15419.70s -> 15423.56s]  I got so addicted to doing those tier lists. I want to do them again
[15424.12s -> 15426.18s]  It's allowed to be tomorrow night
[15426.18s -> 15431.20s]  And if you're fairly new to the channel and you don't know what a comb stream is
[15431.92s -> 15432.96s]  uh
[15432.96s -> 15434.96s]  it's a stream where
[15434.96s -> 15439.44s]  I just put on the webcam and we just do like fuck all for like four or six hours
[15440.16s -> 15442.16s]  We just do whatever
[15442.16s -> 15456.69s]  All right. What do I want to do here? A lot of stuff to do. It's gonna go right at the front door
[15457.41s -> 15464.15s]  It's the streams where we get footage for our deep fakes
[15468.24s -> 15470.13s]  Probably true
[15470.13s -> 15473.22s]  Probably correct. All right, let's get right up here
[15474.02s -> 15478.42s]  It's the best way to get in here
[15481.41s -> 15484.07s]  I don't want to do this
[15484.07s -> 15486.07s]  Can I like honk on this and have it not work?
[15488.21s -> 15493.46s]  What about the wrench use wrench to deactivate
[15496.79s -> 15498.47s]  Minus 30
[15498.47s -> 15500.68s]  I can only do that once
[15500.68s -> 15505.54s]  I need a silent killer
[15505.54s -> 15509.06s]  This all makes way too much noise. Um
[15509.70s -> 15513.62s]  Okay, what if I like honk blast him through the own his own laser?
[15516.21s -> 15519.01s]  Kind of a little sort of sort of worked
[15519.73s -> 15522.87s]  Uh, do I have any of the melee weapons? No
[15523.11s -> 15530.28s]  Retreat the shit out of them
[15530.28s -> 15533.48s]  Oh fuck he got a bat. He's got a bat. He's got a bat. He's got a bat. He's got a bat. Shoot him in the head
[15534.44s -> 15540.96s]  Okay, i'm good the honk blast technique would have been pretty good
[15543.84s -> 15548.07s]  Will you eat five more mcchickens?
[15549.54s -> 15553.43s]  No, i'm gonna take a break from fast food
[15555.72s -> 15557.72s]  No more fast food for like a month
[15558.04s -> 15567.06s]  I don't eat it that often but
[15567.22s -> 15571.64s]  Lately, it's just been yeah. You know what? I want taco bell. I want mcchickens
[15572.50s -> 15578.66s]  There has not been a time in the last like month and a half where i've gone. Yeah, I want a cob salad
[15579.96s -> 15584.76s]  Oh kale sounds good today. No, that has to stop. I have to start to actually care about that
[15585.48s -> 15590.47s]  Okay, so there's two more
[15590.87s -> 15593.54s]  So you come with me
[15593.54s -> 15595.54s]  Safe back there just open it
[15595.78s -> 15598.88s]  Uh
[15598.88s -> 15602.48s]  I got no reason to go in there. He's got the key to that safe, but it's gonna be nothing in it
[15603.12s -> 15611.89s]  I haven't been eating unhealthy
[15612.53s -> 15614.53s]  I've just been craving
[15614.93s -> 15618.53s]  All the unhealthy stuff that doesn't mean i've been acting on it
[15619.17s -> 15623.38s]  All right, you got a job for me?
[15625.89s -> 15629.17s]  Neutralize the thief and can I buy food from you?
[15631.43s -> 15633.03s]  All you have is beers
[15633.03s -> 15652.20s]  I take them
[15652.20s -> 15665.44s]  pretty loud speakers
[15665.44s -> 15668.16s]  countries to visit on a vacation tier list
[15669.72s -> 15674.20s]  Yeah, if you guys got some good ones and uh compile some for tomorrow because how we did it last time
[15674.20s -> 15676.20s]  I just picked up random ones from the chat
[15677.32s -> 15680.28s]  So if you find some good ones, i'm gonna do a candy list
[15681.24s -> 15687.30s]  So if there's a good bunch of candies chocolates like skittles that type of thing
[15688.10s -> 15704.61s]  Is it worth the 15 hp that actually 30 hp to go in here? No
[15708.39s -> 15717.94s]  Definitely not. All right. Is my loud in here?
[15721.30s -> 15724.10s]  Clerk all right. What about you? Can I get food?
[15725.89s -> 15727.89s]  No, i'm not borrowing any more money
[15728.85s -> 15732.21s]  That ended very badly. All right, so I have to go all the way down in the corner here
[15741.76s -> 15744.29s]  Don't let him alert anybody good
[15744.29s -> 15747.73s]  All right, somebody go get that security camera. Wait, can I just turn off the wrench?
[15748.53s -> 15758.77s]  I got it too bad. It's still alerted everybody
[15760.74s -> 15767.91s]  Give me the bat
[15768.29s -> 15784.50s]  Disaster disaster. All right back to me back to me back to me great everyone you've ever met
[15788.40s -> 15790.16s]  uh
[15790.16s -> 15794.79s]  That's not gonna happen
[15794.79s -> 15796.87s]  I can't I don't even remember anybody i've ever met
[15798.88s -> 15800.88s]  Yeah, what am I talking about? Yes, I do
[15802.90s -> 15804.90s]  But hold on I could probably name you
[15806.08s -> 15808.56s]  I can name you at least like 30 or 40 people
[15810.68s -> 15812.87s]  Do that right now
[15812.87s -> 15814.88s]  Can you name?
[15814.88s -> 15816.96s]  Let's just say the last hundred people that you've met
[15818.12s -> 15819.64s]  I don't think you could
[15819.64s -> 15832.64s]  It would take a lot of thought
[15832.64s -> 15834.96s]  That's way too much. Yeah. Okay. What about the last 20?
[15835.68s -> 15839.38s]  And i'm talking that like met for the first time
[15840.26s -> 15842.26s]  Where was it and who were who was it?
[15842.42s -> 15846.32s]  Okay, I gotta kill everybody in here
[15849.28s -> 15852.16s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait all attack
[15852.32s -> 15853.76s]  Start with the goon
[15853.76s -> 15855.76s]  Neutralize the goon. Let's go
[15859.54s -> 15861.54s]  And then from behind the door
[15862.10s -> 15864.10s]  We just get a free shot here
[15865.06s -> 15867.56s]  You're done
[15867.56s -> 15872.36s]  Oh, don't not you you i'm gonna get ready, you know, we'll just do it with the wrench few times. No, what do I have?
[15875.99s -> 15880.08s]  We can just beat this guy up
[15880.08s -> 15882.69s]  open the doors
[15882.69s -> 15892.36s]  Got it, right. That's it. Three out of three. Let's move
[15892.92s -> 15899.19s]  You know, I actually I probably think I would have trouble with the last
[15899.91s -> 15901.91s]  Five people that I've ever met
[15902.39s -> 15905.03s]  And do this from behind the wall
[15905.03s -> 15913.03s]  All right, watch out back up
[15913.59s -> 15916.98s]  You fucking idiot
[15918.82s -> 15925.67s]  What is he doing?
[15929.17s -> 15951.28s]  No, no you were inside the fortnight circle you idiot we had him at least I won damn it
[15960.37s -> 15974.42s]  Thankfully didn't hit me. What the hell happened?
[15976.64s -> 15978.64s]  They were here. No, they're not
[15979.20s -> 15983.94s]  It was so unnecessary. I just took like 30 points of damage for no reason
[15985.73s -> 15987.25s]  I could just leave
[15987.25s -> 16005.22s]  Five nuggets ammo though
[16006.18s -> 16008.18s]  Assist me what no
[16008.34s -> 16011.35s]  I can do that for free
[16011.35s -> 16014.48s]  uh
[16015.20s -> 16017.76s]  I refilled the shotgun because I just wasted it all
[16019.83s -> 16023.30s]  Let's continue
[16023.30s -> 16024.90s]  Hello
[16024.90s -> 16026.66s]  Good good good
[16026.66s -> 16038.95s]  They're all good turn on the face cam. No, I don't do face cam
[16040.74s -> 16046.69s]  Unless it's tomorrow
[16046.69s -> 16063.57s]  If it's tomorrow, then yeah, there'll be a face cam. There we go
[16064.13s -> 16070.23s]  Which terrifying disaster war on the streets
[16071.22s -> 16076.84s]  Radiation rains down on all areas for every 20 seconds or a bounty is placed on my head
[16080.15s -> 16082.15s]  Now don't do war zone again
[16082.63s -> 16088.69s]  War zone is too random do the other one do this one. Don't do this one do one of these two
[16088.85s -> 16092.32s]  We haven't seen it yet
[16092.32s -> 16094.16s]  Two seconds. Come on
[16094.16s -> 16096.66s]  No
[16096.66s -> 16099.78s]  And it won two it won. I got shit for that before closing the poll early
[16104.87s -> 16109.99s]  It's a war. All right. Well, let's just go do the stuff. I need to do quickly
[16110.71s -> 16112.71s]  Like kill this person
[16114.79s -> 16117.51s]  I didn't really mean to do that now. He's running great. Come on. Come here
[16118.63s -> 16129.24s]  Oh shit, who's this?
[16129.24s -> 16131.24s]  All right, I need to neutralize this guy
[16131.24s -> 16138.92s]  I get him both actually. All right, we'll eat this
[16140.64s -> 16141.52s]  Really?
[16141.52s -> 16143.52s]  That sucks
[16143.92s -> 16146.61s]  Did I shoot a soldier I saw that I shot a soldier
[16147.78s -> 16149.81s]  That's bad
[16149.81s -> 16155.33s]  I have the whole team on me. Oh, what have I done? Oh, no, i'm freaking out. How do I teleport?
[16160.13s -> 16163.97s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Why did I do that? What's fucking wrong with me?
[16169.01s -> 16174.96s]  Watch out for the train
[16174.96s -> 16178.64s]  I'm just I have to get out. All right, we gotta kill the guy up here and get that thing and leave
[16179.28s -> 16187.40s]  We're going here. Okay, get in there
[16187.40s -> 16196.58s]  Where's the other red guy?
[16196.58s -> 16197.46s]  Shit
[16197.46s -> 16201.17s]  Oh my fucking god
[16201.17s -> 16203.11s]  Killer thrower what I do
[16203.11s -> 16205.97s]  What's what's going on?
[16205.97s -> 16207.97s]  Let's go. I I killer thrower. I just
[16208.37s -> 16221.46s]  Be stupid. I can't believe I took that syringe. It doesn't do anything slow and confused. Great. I'm selling them every single time
[16223.33s -> 16225.33s]  every single fucking time
[16229.36s -> 16231.84s]  No, please please I have to aim the other way
[16232.56s -> 16249.43s]  Stay back
[16249.43s -> 16251.43s]  Oh, it's just okay. It's the butler
[16251.51s -> 16277.54s]  Do the axe I can get out of this
[16277.94s -> 16279.67s]  onto the park
[16279.67s -> 16290.23s]  Okay, so this is I activate it and then when I throw something they explode
[16291.11s -> 16299.04s]  I understand. This is probably the best
[16299.68s -> 16301.04s]  no ghosts
[16301.04s -> 16309.08s]  so the internet
[16309.08s -> 16312.92s]  This was kind of the first stream back to make sure that it works and to test it
[16313.72s -> 16316.68s]  It's been okay
[16316.68s -> 16318.05s]  I have
[16318.05s -> 16320.36s]  In four and a half hours
[16320.36s -> 16324.20s]  Just over like one percent drop frames. It hasn't really done been terrible
[16325.73s -> 16330.77s]  Could be way worse if you were here a few days ago like four or five days ago. It was unbearable. I couldn't even stream
[16333.65s -> 16335.65s]  Let's hope they continue to figure out what's going on
[16336.95s -> 16340.39s]  One percent is bad. Oh, yeah, it's bad, but it's better than like 30 percent
[16340.55s -> 16343.91s]  Which is what it was before and dropping to zero and the stream turns off
[16347.73s -> 16349.59s]  It's gonna keep happening
[16349.59s -> 16351.59s]  All I can do is deal with it
[16351.99s -> 16353.99s]  And try to get it fixed
[16353.99s -> 16355.27s]  so
[16355.27s -> 16358.47s]  At least I can have my screen be on and not just turn the damn thing off
[16359.27s -> 16362.98s]  All right. Here we go. Now I gotta do
[16363.62s -> 16365.62s]  Everything is clear. Everything's done. Give me up
[16373.78s -> 16376.02s]  Yeah, forget it. Holy shit. Who are you?
[16388.74s -> 16390.74s]  He jinxed it he started saying the words
[16392.31s -> 16397.44s]  If you say the if you say cox in a row as the word is spelled out
[16399.04s -> 16401.04s]  Your internet starts to turn off
[16402.77s -> 16406.05s]  All right, this is gonna be bad. I haven't gotten past the floor one here. Have I?
[16408.77s -> 16410.77s]  I'll take a soldier. Can I recruit you?
[16410.93s -> 16414.44s]  It's worth it
[16414.44s -> 16416.44s]  No, it wasn't why the hell did I do that?
[16417.14s -> 16419.14s]  I thought that was one soldier
[16419.14s -> 16421.22s]  No, actually that was worth it. I'm glad I did that
[16425.62s -> 16427.62s]  I have I put the jukebox down
[16427.70s -> 16435.70s]  Why is it not dancing?
[16436.50s -> 16441.89s]  Oh, no
[16441.89s -> 16480.66s]  Uh, there's a crazy person in that bush. He's gonna run out with an axe. What's going on?
[16493.11s -> 16494.79s]  Why is he dancing
[16494.79s -> 16500.23s]  He's the only person that's dancing out of all the people that we're able to dance. It's him dancing great
[16501.19s -> 16509.68s]  Okay, the axe is the best
[16509.68s -> 16513.40s]  three out of three dead
[16513.40s -> 16514.60s]  chest
[16514.60s -> 16520.85s]  That's good, too
[16520.85s -> 16523.25s]  Jerma go in the water go in the water. That's not gonna go in the water
[16525.09s -> 16527.54s]  That would be a mistake
[16527.54s -> 16529.22s]  Oh shopkeeper
[16529.22s -> 16530.18s]  Nice
[16530.18s -> 16533.51s]  I still have to do the two missions. Okay
[16533.83s -> 16536.20s]  Can I buy stuff from you, please?
[16538.26s -> 16540.10s]  safe buster
[16540.10s -> 16541.46s]  machine gun
[16541.46s -> 16543.81s]  I need the food
[16543.81s -> 16545.09s]  taser
[16545.09s -> 16546.68s]  can't afford
[16546.68s -> 16553.00s]  What does the muscle pill do?
[16553.00s -> 16556.20s]  so activate that and just use the axe and just swing around in a circle
[16557.00s -> 16564.92s]  Watch out for
[16564.92s -> 16566.92s]  There are vampires in this game, too
[16569.41s -> 16570.37s]  Why?
[16570.37s -> 16577.84s]  Why are there vampires?
[16578.16s -> 16580.16s]  Okay, the vampires are hostile to me
[16580.72s -> 16593.59s]  All right. I've had just about enough of this shit
[16594.23s -> 16629.69s]  Which one too bad that wasn't a rocket launcher in castlevania
[16630.79s -> 16633.73s]  That is too bad
[16633.73s -> 16636.53s]  Well, you had the holy water, right? Did you throw the flaming holy water?
[16637.25s -> 16650.42s]  Thanks for the four leaf clover
[16650.50s -> 16651.68s]  Okay
[16651.68s -> 16652.88s]  so now
[16652.88s -> 16655.60s]  Just have to rescue this person and get 37 bucks and then get out
[16656.16s -> 16658.16s]  And there's a celamatic over there, too
[16658.24s -> 16660.32s]  Good. In fact, you know, let's just sneak around
[16661.12s -> 16675.19s]  This is not easy. What the hell is it leave now who me?
[16676.07s -> 16684.16s]  He's throwing me
[16684.16s -> 16685.44s]  whiskey

[16698.69s -> 16700.69s]  Let me syringes real cigarettes
[16702.77s -> 16704.69s]  Who is dying up there?
[16704.69s -> 16706.71s]  the knife
[16706.71s -> 16710.15s]  Probably the wrench too
[16710.15s -> 16713.30s]  Can I sell the clover?
[16713.30s -> 16716.05s]  Put the silencer on the pistol
[16716.29s -> 16723.97s]  That purple lake heals you that is the most bullshit thing i've ever heard in my life
[16724.77s -> 16737.48s]  right click to combine
[16737.48s -> 16742.53s]  Left click to be okay. There we go
[16742.53s -> 16744.53s]  Go in the purple water
[16745.33s -> 16748.13s]  Is the most horseshit thing i've ever heard
[16748.69s -> 16751.97s]  You want me to go in this water and it's gonna heal me. Sure. Okay
[16753.92s -> 16755.36s]  If this poisons me
[16755.36s -> 16757.36s]  I get 5000 subs
[16759.32s -> 16761.32s]  Oh, never mind. I don't get anything
[16764.45s -> 16765.49s]  Oh well
[16765.49s -> 16767.49s]  I don't get it
[16767.49s -> 16785.91s]  What are you so happy about?
[16785.91s -> 16792.63s]  We get 5000 now
[16792.71s -> 16798.29s]  Syringe? No. All right, let's go up here. I can't believe that's real
[16802.69s -> 16810.04s]  Honk come on out this sword
[16819.36s -> 16821.36s]  Seven dollars. Wow
[16823.38s -> 16825.38s]  That's a lot of money
[16825.38s -> 16827.38s]  He's a gun. Don't he? Oh yes, he does
[16828.39s -> 16829.27s]  bruh
[16829.27s -> 16857.54s]  How did that miss? Let's go
[16861.86s -> 16864.66s]  Poison the water. No, don't don't don't don't do that. Don't do that
[16864.90s -> 16868.13s]  I would have
[16868.13s -> 16871.91s]  fuck
[16874.44s -> 16876.44s]  I want to go into the water
[16876.52s -> 16900.47s]  Where to go? Oh, the jukebox is still down there. Okay
[16905.81s -> 16909.17s]  Uh-oh, i'm overstaying my welcome in here. What happens when it gets to zero?
[16909.97s -> 16920.44s]  Is it doesn't a bad thing, right?
[16920.44s -> 16922.05s]  zero
[16922.05s -> 16923.33s]  No, okay
[16923.33s -> 16928.64s]  You can make a custom class in this game. That's pretty cool
[16930.20s -> 16936.84s]  Yeah, I do want to say after this I don't want to see what I have unlocked watch out for cannibals
[16937.32s -> 16941.04s]  There's one over there
[16941.04s -> 16951.01s]  And we're good floor clear
[16953.16s -> 16955.16s]  Three chicken nuggets good
[16961.94s -> 16968.64s]  Oh pretty good. Can this game be a common stream choice from now on?
[16969.68s -> 16971.68s]  Um, I don't know. I'm just kind of just playing it
[16973.32s -> 16975.32s]  Ever since it released I've wanted to check it out
[16975.80s -> 16978.04s]  I'm not sure if I would do this all the time
[16978.36s -> 16982.39s]  There's a lot of content here though
[16982.47s -> 16985.92s]  You could put a lot of time into this
[16991.08s -> 16994.05s]  That means so that means no
[16994.05s -> 16997.94s]  I didn't say that I said you could put a lot of time into this
[17002.18s -> 17008.61s]  All right. We got a bunch of stuff over here. We're gonna neutralize some people get that chest. I'll go for it
[17008.77s -> 17011.16s]  sure
[17011.16s -> 17013.64s]  What the hell are these? All right, there's killer plants now
[17014.44s -> 17023.88s]  I'm kind of curious. What does that mean? What does a killer plant mean?
[17024.84s -> 17034.56s]  Can I pick it up? Can I have a killer plant?
[17035.20s -> 17039.75s]  What does this do? It's not
[17040.23s -> 17051.64s]  Okay, there's no reason me to do this. It's just a chest over here sugar
[17057.32s -> 17058.60s]  Speeds you up
[17058.60s -> 17061.14s]  Okay
[17061.14s -> 17063.06s]  Interesting. Give me the
[17063.06s -> 17065.12s]  I need some new weapons
[17065.12s -> 17072.96s]  My guns are low
[17072.96s -> 17078.53s]  Shit could have seen you coming from a mile away, but i'm stupid
[17079.09s -> 17091.27s]  You shouldn't be that big of a problem. What do I got rocket launcher right in the front door?
[17107.62s -> 17109.22s]  That was pretty good
[17109.22s -> 17118.47s]  No, no mystery item. Let's do a ski thing though. Cool. All right weapons, right?
[17119.43s -> 17123.59s]  I'm gonna buy the sandwich. Yeah, i'm gonna buy both the heels
[17124.64s -> 17126.08s]  I need them
[17126.08s -> 17130.23s]  All right. Next is
[17130.31s -> 17134.82s]  I'm not doing that
[17137.01s -> 17146.10s]  I'll use a knife until it's gone clone machine
[17148.04s -> 17151.00s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what am I cloning? I don't want to clone anything. Stop
[17151.80s -> 17154.90s]  No, what are you doing? Stop
[17154.90s -> 17156.90s]  No, I want to go in the door
[17157.46s -> 17162.45s]  I almost just stepped right on that
[17169.81s -> 17179.80s]  Moron already there three

[17210.29s -> 17219.36s]  No, i'll get them shit
[17231.99s -> 17233.03s]  Oh
[17233.03s -> 17240.29s]  He has to die
[17240.29s -> 17256.29s]  Only one more thing to do in the right side and this is the other guy here and then I can get out
[17257.84s -> 17259.84s]  Most of the end of this, uh this area
[17263.56s -> 17264.84s]  Yeah, this is it
[17264.84s -> 17271.83s]  Then there's the third level and then the the fourth area which is something we've not seen yet
[17272.93s -> 17275.46s]  Wonder what it is. I don't know find out
[17276.02s -> 17277.48s]  Give me the gun

[17285.43s -> 17288.77s]  Give me beers
[17288.77s -> 17292.66s]  Watch out for the bear traps and where do you go up here?
[17293.62s -> 17301.73s]  Where the hell are you? Where'd he go? Down there?
[17303.17s -> 17304.69s]  He needs one bullet
[17304.69s -> 17308.34s]  What the hell is he?
[17308.34s -> 17312.20s]  Is he hiding in a bush?
[17312.20s -> 17313.96s]  Oh, it's the
[17313.96s -> 17315.72s]  Other one up there
[17315.72s -> 17329.08s]  Pretty good. Oh, this is gonna be pain in the ass
[17329.56s -> 17331.08s]  These guys are all armed
[17331.08s -> 17336.20s]  I'm gonna have to go for it
[17336.52s -> 17360.10s]  Great got it. Uh
[17360.82s -> 17392.20s]  Give me the I don't know. I don't know. Okay. I have no idea. They're all good. Good choice. Good choice
[17392.44s -> 17406.69s]  I can leave right? Yeah, that's it. There's other stuff dying
[17408.69s -> 17415.58s]  Bombs dropping hidden bombs or killer robot
[17426.77s -> 17431.75s]  Is it gonna be three for three
[17431.75s -> 17444.15s]  These are all terrible
[17444.15s -> 17452.66s]  Where is he over there?
[17452.66s -> 17457.75s]  All right. I kind of got straight up in the middle. All right, let me get a freeze ray. Just go
[17458.63s -> 17464.96s]  I have to go quick
[17464.96s -> 17467.52s]  Do I not have anything I can destroy the buckets with?
[17468.16s -> 17486.45s]  He did it for me. Can I turn this off with a wrench? How do I turn? How do I do this without getting hurt?
[17487.65s -> 17490.69s]  Oh fuck i'm in trouble. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm gonna die
[17495.36s -> 17497.36s]  I just unlocked a new character
[17499.06s -> 17500.10s]  No
[17500.10s -> 17502.10s]  God damn it. Oh
[17505.64s -> 17510.20s]  Stupid poison barrels, I can't destroy them unless I fucking smash them
[17510.84s -> 17519.41s]  I'm going home. That's so aggravating
[17519.97s -> 17533.44s]  I gotta walk up and punch this thing because I don't have any bullets left
[17534.24s -> 17537.36s]  All the while a robot's just walking down with a rocket launcher
[17540.00s -> 17541.12s]  bullshit
[17541.12s -> 17550.20s]  Give me this thing
[17550.20s -> 17552.04s]  Oh, I like that too
[17552.04s -> 17558.08s]  All right. I'm doing a new character
[17558.08s -> 17564.60s]  Let's see who we have
[17564.60s -> 17565.64s]  cannibal
[17565.64s -> 17576.21s]  Feast on corpses to gain health human meat is the only food that can restore your health alcohol works, too
[17577.44s -> 17580.96s]  Business owners want you to leave most people won't join your party
[17581.76s -> 17585.03s]  So I have to eat dead bodies
[17585.03s -> 17587.78s]  What was the other ones I got bartender?
[17589.12s -> 17592.00s]  Serve cocktails to anyone like it's your job or something
[17592.56s -> 17594.20s]  Okay
[17594.20s -> 17596.20s]  Most people are initially friendly toward you
[17596.68s -> 17598.68s]  Enter some private property without an issue
[17599.48s -> 17603.54s]  Three followers can follow you and all syringes are identified
[17606.05s -> 17607.72s]  interesting
[17607.72s -> 17610.39s]  shopkeeper
[17610.39s -> 17614.63s]  Recognizes that everything has a price can purchase items from anyone at marked up prices
[17615.96s -> 17617.96s]  And items in the shop cost less
[17620.66s -> 17622.66s]  So you can purchase anything from anybody
[17622.82s -> 17631.35s]  I think anybody else I feel like I got somebody else. Let's try the cannibal
[17638.08s -> 17640.23s]  That's fine
[17640.23s -> 17644.80s]  wait
[17644.80s -> 17647.86s]  So I have to eat people I can only eat human meat and nobody likes me
[17653.49s -> 17655.68s]  so is this just like a
[17655.68s -> 17659.70s]  murder run
[17659.70s -> 17661.70s]  Okay, eat a certain type of person
[17662.66s -> 17667.35s]  Eat a doctor
[17667.35s -> 17671.48s]  Well, you're all safe
[17671.48s -> 17691.32s]  Create a character next time. Okay, I will it's a lot of money. Okay, eat. How do I eat them?
[17694.52s -> 17695.80s]  I'm stuffed
[17695.80s -> 17700.28s]  Oh, it's right click
[17700.28s -> 17704.52s]  So it heals. Okay, that's pretty ridiculous. All right, eat a doctor. Okay, there's doctors in here
[17705.48s -> 17707.48s]  So let's go eat a doctor
[17707.72s -> 17718.61s]  All right. Well, that's
[17718.61s -> 17721.89s]  Actually, really really really really good of a perk
[17722.61s -> 17732.50s]  All right, let's go do the missions
[17732.50s -> 17734.18s]  Do both in a row
[17734.18s -> 17738.02s]  Destroy and retrieve let's go this way
[17740.61s -> 17761.81s]  First no, we'll do this one first reward. All right friend phone
[17762.45s -> 17764.45s]  melee durability spray
[17764.77s -> 17776.61s]  That'd be good to the axe
[17776.61s -> 17778.85s]  More cannibals does it actually call other cannibals?
[17779.49s -> 17782.68s]  That'd be kind of funny actually
[17782.68s -> 17797.27s]  I'll just eat them
[17797.27s -> 17801.80s]  Is there a certain amount of people I can eat in one map or does it not matter?
[17802.44s -> 17805.88s]  We're traps too. All right. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving look
[17806.60s -> 17808.20s]  You can watch me leave
[17808.20s -> 17810.20s]  I don't know how to get out. Where's the exit?
[17810.60s -> 17814.74s]  I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm out
[17816.48s -> 17817.94s]  You whiffed
[17817.94s -> 17819.94s]  I'm gone. Leave me alone
[17820.63s -> 17822.63s]  Leave me alone. Look, I don't want to kill you
[17823.11s -> 17825.67s]  Look, I don't want to have to knock you out. Okay, but I will
[17826.71s -> 17840.96s]  This guy is mad
[17843.91s -> 17857.35s]  Yeah, that's right run away. Hi hamburger. No, I sell it I eat people
[17862.96s -> 17877.99s]  Shit nice. I'll take it. This is gonna be interesting though because I have to destroy this. Um, okay
[17878.71s -> 17882.88s]  How does one get in there?
[17882.88s -> 17885.20s]  annoyed, um
[17885.20s -> 17886.96s]  I can just break through
[17886.96s -> 17894.85s]  It's not really a reliable way to do this unless I
[17896.32s -> 17899.91s]  Maybe hold on. Oh shit
[17901.83s -> 17904.39s]  All right, I can do it
[17904.39s -> 17910.39s]  Did you actually see me? No, you didn't
[17910.39s -> 17912.88s]  No, no, no get out

[17929.44s -> 17930.88s]  Don't know what that does
[17930.88s -> 17943.56s]  There are a lot of characters
[17943.56s -> 17956.80s]  Shape shifter is great
[17956.80s -> 17961.97s]  What are you giving me?
[17961.97s -> 17969.03s]  Hmm. All those were kind of not super great for this character
[17971.99s -> 17975.38s]  All right, eat a cop
[17975.38s -> 17977.38s]  And do all these other missions. Okay
[17979.48s -> 17983.96s]  Eat a cop

[18080.28s -> 18082.45s]  But it's free money
[18084.87s -> 18089.67s]  Retrieve the incriminating photo from the worker over here
[18090.47s -> 18098.12s]  I'll try
[18098.12s -> 18100.12s]  The alcohol still is good though, right? Yeah
[18111.88s -> 18114.37s]  Front door. Yeah
[18114.61s -> 18125.33s]  I'm just gonna wrench
[18125.33s -> 18126.93s]  Oh shit

[18127.81s -> 18129.17s]  It hurts
[18129.17s -> 18137.59s]  I need to feed on more people. Okay, I gotta eat you
[18145.35s -> 18147.51s]  You better stop that. Oh, I gotta eat that cop
[18155.41s -> 18159.99s]  How am I gonna do this though bear trap? I'm gonna put like three bear traps down like right here

[18182.02s -> 18189.22s]  Turn this in
[18189.22s -> 18193.86s]  These guys they're not hostile, right? I keep thinking of for some reason i'm playing so much on the gang character
[18199.32s -> 18201.00s]  All right. Now i've done that
[18201.00s -> 18203.24s]  Have to do these two up here and let's go
[18203.88s -> 18215.16s]  I'm just gonna go in break the window and just get it
[18218.23s -> 18221.80s]  Goodbye
[18221.80s -> 18223.08s]  No cop, right?
[18223.08s -> 18232.98s]  Health is not a problem with this character. So i'm it's all right
[18233.70s -> 18240.45s]  And then across the way wait, wait, wait, what's up here? Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
[18244.15s -> 18245.35s]  Uh
[18245.35s -> 18251.41s]  Let's eat them both
[18251.41s -> 18259.48s]  Here comes one man spam

[18274.93s -> 18286.15s]  Final break out these two good. All right. How do I do this without getting in trouble?
[18287.11s -> 18294.79s]  I don't it was that easy
[18295.75s -> 18307.54s]  Break them out and then eat them. Well, I don't need to my health is fine. Good to go
[18308.10s -> 18317.24s]  I want to start playing this game again
[18317.32s -> 18318.52s]  Oh
[18318.52s -> 18321.08s]  That's one this one this one this one this one this one do this one
[18325.17s -> 18329.17s]  Bodies are cannibalized faster. There's nothing else that matters. Just press one
[18333.75s -> 18335.03s]  No, it's fun game
[18335.03s -> 18339.65s]  There's a lot to do
[18339.65s -> 18345.27s]  Kind of keeps the carrot on the stick in front of you with all the unlocks and all the perks you buy and stuff
[18348.08s -> 18351.22s]  That's good. Oh, here we go
[18352.60s -> 18354.84s]  Who's bombs dropping or riot?
[18357.09s -> 18360.85s]  We've seen riot. We've not seen ooze or bombs dropping
[18362.53s -> 18364.53s]  But it is chat. So
[18365.49s -> 18367.49s]  Chances are they're gonna pick the one
[18369.84s -> 18374.40s]  We're never gonna see off there's an equal amount of fight against that
[18375.83s -> 18377.51s]  Yeah, we're gonna see ooze
[18377.51s -> 18379.51s]  Ooze is spreading. Don't touch it
[18379.59s -> 18388.72s]  I get the curve go
[18389.40s -> 18391.40s]  Don't touch the ooze
[18399.91s -> 18401.35s]  Eat a goon
[18401.35s -> 18411.52s]  And then there's two things up there. Okay goon eat a goon. Oh god, come on
[18414.24s -> 18418.64s]  See how long this takes
[18418.64s -> 18421.68s]  That's much faster. All right, cool. Let's open the uh, let's open it. What about
[18421.84s -> 18423.04s]  Oh
[18423.04s -> 18430.84s]  Goon eaten. Oh, I don't see very much ooze
[18431.56s -> 18436.55s]  Anybody see any ooze that guy's a gun
[18436.87s -> 18453.83s]  Can I use guns? Yeah
[18454.07s -> 18457.33s]  Why am I acting like I can't use it?
[18457.41s -> 18462.18s]  Turns out this one sucks
[18462.18s -> 18469.32s]  I don't see any danger at all
[18469.32s -> 18471.32s]  These are ooze. I don't see ooze
[18475.12s -> 18477.12s]  No, this is safe
[18477.12s -> 18484.10s]  I do have to get rid of these though
[18486.15s -> 18488.39s]  Turn around
[18488.39s -> 18492.77s]  Look at the map
[18492.77s -> 18502.98s]  This down here
[18502.98s -> 18505.30s]  Oh, it is spreading up here. I'm really far away though
[18505.86s -> 18517.89s]  I'll be done with this by the time it gets up here
[18518.37s -> 18527.11s]  We're good
[18527.11s -> 18530.31s]  Oh god. Oh fuck. Oh god. Oh fuck the ooze
[18536.48s -> 18538.82s]  No, I can see it. No, it's the darker
[18539.62s -> 18541.06s]  gray on the mini map
[18541.06s -> 18560.32s]  The ooze approach it. I'm gonna go look at it
[18561.12s -> 18564.04s]  Because i'm done
[18564.04s -> 18566.44s]  I ate a goon. I did everything I needed to do. Yeah
[18567.70s -> 18569.46s]  I kind of want to look at it
[18569.46s -> 18572.23s]  I'm curious
[18572.23s -> 18584.76s]  What does it look like?
[18584.76s -> 18586.76s]  Okay, it is just creeping
[18587.62s -> 18589.22s]  Does it kill people?
[18589.22s -> 18601.01s]  Is it gonna wipe out this whole bar? It's not even going in the bar
[18601.65s -> 18608.36s]  Oh, well, it's too dangerous to teleport. Why?
[18613.92s -> 18616.66s]  Touch it. It's safe
[18616.66s -> 18622.02s]  Nope
[18622.02s -> 18624.02s]  Eat a slum dweller
[18624.60s -> 18626.60s]  That should be pretty easy
[18639.49s -> 18640.93s]  Oh shit, i'm not hurt
[18640.93s -> 18642.37s]  No, there we go. I'm good
[18642.37s -> 18649.04s]  What do these power bucks shut down the power box?
[18651.41s -> 18653.41s]  Well, now we gotta eat a couple of cops
[18654.37s -> 18659.24s]  I'm gonna waste a fucking space there
[18663.01s -> 18665.33s]  Stop it. Oh my god, you're killing me
[18668.16s -> 18670.72s]  No, don't let him don't let him
[18670.72s -> 18676.24s]  Oh
[18676.24s -> 18678.24s]  No, I can't eat him if you do that
[18678.32s -> 18696.77s]  You get more hp if the meat is cooked, right?
[18698.60s -> 18707.43s]  All right. What is it? I need to do
[18707.43s -> 18717.57s]  Uh worker, uh, I didn't mean to do that
[18719.75s -> 18722.31s]  Well, they'll be cooked now, right? Let's test your theory
[18722.95s -> 18734.21s]  All right, they're gonna be cooked
[18734.21s -> 18736.21s]  You actually would not like
[18738.72s -> 18746.56s]  That's real
[18746.56s -> 18748.87s]  That's kind of unbelievable
[18748.87s -> 18752.39s]  Well little details, huh? All right. Let me turn this shit off
[18755.97s -> 18757.97s]  Turn off the gas open the doors
[18766.95s -> 18779.40s]  Neutralize this person. All right cook them
[18785.91s -> 18790.23s]  Oh, the purple water doesn't heal cooked meat doesn't heal better. I how am I supposed to trust you guys?
[18791.11s -> 18793.52s]  You know, many times i've been baited in games like these before
[18802.63s -> 18808.34s]  I'll take a shotgun

[18917.27s -> 18920.37s]  Didn't they make a movie about that?
[18920.37s -> 18926.58s]  There's a whole movie based around what you're saying
[18943.91s -> 18954.96s]  Hello. Hello

[18966.40s -> 18975.49s]  Stalking this guy

[18996.07s -> 18997.83s]  Ow, god damn it
[18997.83s -> 19007.49s]  The stream's broken
[19007.49s -> 19019.57s]  What is it all screwed up again?
[19019.57s -> 19021.57s]  Yeah, you should be able to just kind of refresh it
[19022.05s -> 19024.42s]  That's not a worker
[19024.42s -> 19035.62s]  Where is there a worker that's in a room that i'm not going to explode accidentally
[19040.39s -> 19042.39s]  Worker worker worker. I need a worker
[19043.27s -> 19047.11s]  Come on
[19047.11s -> 19049.11s]  I did not mean to blow the last worker up
[19049.67s -> 19061.75s]  That can't be the only worker here
[19061.75s -> 19075.94s]  Well, we're going in

[19099.16s -> 19105.14s]  Should be good
[19105.14s -> 19107.14s]  You just steal from the cop
[19107.62s -> 19113.88s]  Why would you pickpocket police officer? That's probably the dumbest thing you could ever do
[19114.84s -> 19126.04s]  I still need to eat a worker
[19126.04s -> 19127.00s]  Shit
[19127.00s -> 19132.69s]  That's a slum dweller
[19133.01s -> 19135.01s]  I'm not sure there's another worker on here
[19135.96s -> 19137.96s]  Firefighters count as workers
[19147.49s -> 19148.77s]  Worker. All right
[19148.77s -> 19150.90s]  I need to do this right

[19178.28s -> 19180.28s]  I don't want to kill him instantly
[19181.44s -> 19191.49s]  This backstab will kill him
[19191.49s -> 19193.09s]  I don't have an opportunity to
[19193.09s -> 19199.17s]  He's going faster

[19368.76s -> 19373.56s]  Everyone explodes now
[19373.56s -> 19377.00s]  Everybody explodes. How do I make it so people don't explode?
[19378.04s -> 19391.59s]  I have to kill them with a gun
[19391.59s -> 19393.59s]  Use the flamethrower. Yeah, but not right now
[19395.52s -> 19399.36s]  I need this

[20382.08s -> 20395.81s]  Sounds good to me
[20395.81s -> 20399.78s]  No, that's a lot
[20400.58s -> 20402.82s]  Looks like a self-part character generator
[20404.24s -> 20406.85s]  All right. Good
[20406.85s -> 20412.10s]  I think we're ready
[20412.10s -> 20413.46s]  This is the one
[20413.46s -> 20415.46s]  Why does the super loud guy?
[20415.62s -> 20420.26s]  Have a silencer. That's a really good question one that I can't answer. Why am I so small?
[20421.06s -> 20423.81s]  Really? The guns are bigger than me
[20424.21s -> 20426.21s]  That's not that's not good. Okay

[20428.05s -> 20437.19s]  I need to go down a toilet
[20437.19s -> 20443.40s]  You can start with 300 bucks for 10 points. That's insane. I already forget what all the perks were
[20450.36s -> 20460.92s]  rescue
[20460.92s -> 20463.19s]  Jax i'm, sorry
[20463.19s -> 20465.19s]  I'm sorry. You just that's not gonna happen
[20465.67s -> 20470.56s]  All right. We're gonna try to go through the toilet. We're gonna travel like the rats
[20471.20s -> 20479.12s]  I can't open this. Oh, I can't open it
[20480.08s -> 20482.08s]  All right. I'm gonna kill the guy behind the counter
[20482.64s -> 20485.38s]  shopkeeper
[20485.38s -> 20487.38s]  Did that just brick shay and hit me in the head?
[20487.54s -> 20496.69s]  All right, you're free. Let's go. Oh wait
[20497.33s -> 20511.06s]  Do you have a toilet in here?
[20511.06s -> 20524.07s]  Celebrate another one. I birthday bash. This is so stupid. It really is a little south park guy
[20532.50s -> 20536.05s]  Go on don't really have to take you all the way to the entrance
[20542.46s -> 20544.07s]  flamethrower

[20550.93s -> 20552.05s]  zero
[20552.05s -> 20564.31s]  Yellow to see a toilet. I kind of want to try it
[20566.15s -> 20570.79s]  Like can you just hide in the toilets or do you flush down the toilet and end up in another toilet?
[20571.59s -> 20586.60s]  All right, this is where the writer
[20586.60s -> 20589.72s]  Uh, I don't really understand the point of that but okay
[20594.69s -> 20602.39s]  There's no secret
[20602.39s -> 20604.39s]  Things to do so instead of get up
[20605.03s -> 20613.73s]  Oh more choice is good. That's good
[20614.53s -> 20616.10s]  That's good
[20616.10s -> 20624.28s]  That one's good
[20625.70s -> 20632.47s]  Oh, what is this what just happened?
[20633.67s -> 20637.06s]  Toilet, you know where to go
[20637.38s -> 20647.35s]  See you later sucker. This is stupid
[20648.55s -> 20670.64s]  Oh, I broke the toilet. Don't ever run away from jacks. I was gonna go eat that guy neutralize you got it

[20742.20s -> 20757.56s]  All right, let me open this out to the entrance
[20758.12s -> 20776.66s]  All the way to the end all the way all the way down the whole way fast. I didn't realize that was this fast
[20778.11s -> 20780.13s]  teleport, ooh
[20780.13s -> 20786.12s]  Wrong way wrong way, right? I'm stupid. I still have to wait for him though. I can't teleport with him
[20789.75s -> 20802.13s]  Done i'm supposed to be able to use the teleport in the toilet to go to a different toilet
[20802.13s -> 20804.13s]  But maybe there's only one toilet
[20804.21s -> 20814.47s]  That makes sense
[20814.47s -> 20816.79s]  Yeah, no melee melee the jacks is not going to use melee
[20818.26s -> 20827.14s]  I have like one or two points in it. The voucher is good because I could probably get a machine gun
[20833.75s -> 20837.14s]  Going pretty fast. Just give me some good perks and we're good
[20837.78s -> 20843.44s]  Oh, this is bad. I'll take one
[20844.24s -> 20852.68s]  The other ones are awful
[20852.68s -> 20856.68s]  I take more damage and I think I deal less damage right because i'm small
[20858.18s -> 20867.97s]  In the game riot riot we have to riot
[20869.14s -> 20875.78s]  It's time to riot

[21922.93s -> 21927.17s]  Probably belongs in a much more medieval fantasy oriented game, but who cares increases your melee strength
[21927.89s -> 21940.00s]  Give me like the big heel
[21940.00s -> 21947.76s]  Water pump. What is it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Is this a heel?
[21948.56s -> 21950.08s]  No, it's not a heel
[21950.08s -> 21958.34s]  Is it electrified? The water is electrified now
[21962.05s -> 21976.95s]  Uh, is it though? I just poisoned it. Oh, it gives me electro touch
[21977.59s -> 21989.86s]  Okay. Oh, that's an electro touch forever
[21990.58s -> 21991.94s]  Can I electro?
[21991.94s -> 21998.31s]  Get rid of these
[21998.31s -> 22000.23s]  They die
[22000.23s -> 22001.91s]  Oh, yeah, they do
[22001.91s -> 22006.84s]  What is that?
[22006.84s -> 22008.63s]  Okay, nice
[22008.63s -> 22011.12s]  Turns almost any item into food
[22011.84s -> 22015.20s]  Food that probably causes cancer, but that's beyond the game scope
[22017.86s -> 22019.14s]  Wait, what?
[22019.14s -> 22021.57s]  I can can I put the shuriken in there?
[22021.73s -> 22043.64s]  What did it turn into? Oh turning it into the bud
[22044.52s -> 22050.34s]  Is there any more melee shit?
[22050.34s -> 22056.34s]  No, that's good for now
[22056.66s -> 22064.04s]  I wanted to eat the bud
[22064.04s -> 22066.44s]  But it ate the first aid kit and i'm about to level up
[22067.56s -> 22072.76s]  You have no idea just how badly I wish I could save state like 10 seconds ago
[22089.73s -> 22090.53s]  Hey
[22090.53s -> 22094.63s]  Hey
[22094.63s -> 22108.37s]  Oh, I got a friend phone. I'm just gonna sell it. Nobody likes me three dollars. What a waste
[22109.17s -> 22112.05s]  What a serious weight like why would I?
[22112.53s -> 22120.24s]  You got to put at least like five dollars ten dollars in those chests. Come on. Why am I hurting?
[22120.88s -> 22138.61s]  What the? All right. Wait, is there is there a sublimatic? Yeah, there is all right. Get rid of the
[22139.17s -> 22142.29s]  I don't want this. It's confused. It's terrible melee
[22143.25s -> 22145.25s]  Get rid of the banana peels. They don't do anything
[22146.05s -> 22148.05s]  get rid of the
[22150.40s -> 22153.16s]  Uh the phone
[22153.16s -> 22154.28s]  twice
[22154.28s -> 22156.55s]  Nobody I don't have any friends
[22156.55s -> 22159.92s]  All right. I'm okay with this
[22159.92s -> 22163.14s]  Can I buy anything else?
[22163.14s -> 22168.74s]  Axis melee. Yeah, but this could be desperate an incredibly desperate attempt for me to just run them around axe is really powerful
[22169.54s -> 22171.22s]  power powerful
[22171.22s -> 22173.84s]  Yeah, the axe is really powerful
[22174.32s -> 22180.84s]  God I like to talk
[22180.92s -> 22184.08s]  So we got uh, I don't want any of that stuff
[22184.96s -> 22186.96s]  All right. I'm good to go. Just uh destroy the box
[22187.36s -> 22194.80s]  Is there an ammo container anymore?
[22194.80s -> 22196.16s]  No, just bartender
[22196.16s -> 22202.42s]  See what I mean?
[22202.42s -> 22204.58s]  I don't even know what happened. I just knew that I need this axe now
[22205.38s -> 22207.38s]  Because everyone's coming after me
[22207.38s -> 22220.84s]  That dude had 10 bucks
[22220.84s -> 22223.84s]  All right load automatic
[22224.32s -> 22226.36s]  here
[22226.36s -> 22232.31s]  Um, I don't have the silencer equipped. Well, so hold on. Let me do that real quick
[22233.03s -> 22235.88s]  and then
[22235.88s -> 22238.93s]  Hi, I don't understand. What does the atm do?
[22240.32s -> 22244.56s]  Oh, it can be stored between runs. I get it. Okay. So what what's the point of me doing this just to get a
[22245.18s -> 22247.18s]  76 bucks for another gun
[22259.24s -> 22260.44s]  Just ammo
[22260.44s -> 22262.44s]  It's a lot of money for ammo though
[22264.28s -> 22271.32s]  Yeah, it's not worth it. Let's just do this
[22271.96s -> 22274.68s]  Uh, i'm gonna have to use the axe. This is why I kept it
[22280.00s -> 22281.20s]  Right into the water
[22281.20s -> 22291.83s]  It's better if you start the game with rare items because it puts those in there. I see
[22292.39s -> 22300.47s]  Cool none of these are very good for what i'm doing right now
[22301.49s -> 22309.12s]  Unfortunately
[22309.12s -> 22311.76s]  I'll be happy if I get down to the one after this
[22312.48s -> 22317.48s]  Yeah, the leap blower would be actually kind of good here
[22317.88s -> 22319.88s]  Just blow people into the water
[22320.12s -> 22323.25s]  Thank you
[22323.25s -> 22325.25s]  And it's technically a gun. So
[22325.41s -> 22328.87s]  You are correct. It is a gun technically
[22329.75s -> 22331.75s]  Not like anybody was arguing with me about it
[22332.47s -> 22339.32s]  Yeah, you know, you're right. You're right. Yeah, who's right? What are you talking about? Get away from me
[22348.02s -> 22356.10s]  Cocktail whiskey I should buy some of these no don't want that
[22357.38s -> 22360.45s]  Thank you
[22360.45s -> 22365.75s]  Resurrection does that last until I die because that's a huge deal
[22370.64s -> 22378.07s]  Oh shit, i'm done with all the missions. I'm just gonna get out walk him into the trap
[22378.95s -> 22381.24s]  You avoided it
[22381.24s -> 22382.60s]  Okay
[22382.60s -> 22386.53s]  Goodbye, there's an ammo thing right there. No
[22388.63s -> 22390.63s]  No, no, no, no. No. All right. Stop
[22395.36s -> 22397.36s]  Okay, get out get out get out. Okay. All right. All right
[22397.68s -> 22413.28s]  Did I refill the wrong thing? Oh, this is good. This is good
[22418.63s -> 22420.63s]  Was this three two coming up?
[22420.87s -> 22422.07s]  three three
[22422.07s -> 22431.54s]  Something like that, right?
[22431.54s -> 22433.54s]  Yeah, extra experience is always good. That means a full hell
[22434.18s -> 22438.40s]  said that with like a
[22438.40s -> 22442.93s]  English accent or like a scottish accent for some reason. Oh, it's a full hell
[22445.60s -> 22447.60s]  I don't know. Sometimes my brain just turns off
[22448.08s -> 22452.87s]  Selling that
[22452.87s -> 22455.40s]  All right right in there
[22455.40s -> 22457.40s]  Destroy that
[22457.40s -> 22459.40s]  I should be okay. I just yeah watch this ready
[22460.20s -> 22474.07s]  That's a huge
[22474.15s -> 22478.31s]  60 bucks you had a lot of money. Wait, where is it? Was it where is it?
[22480.24s -> 22496.10s]  That was clearly 60. Wasn't it? I did not know you had to equip those
[22499.24s -> 22502.28s]  Uh resist bullets or resist damage. What is the difference?
[22504.04s -> 22522.48s]  Let's go neutralize some folks and then retrieve the chest. Okay. Wait, he doesn't like me, but I don't have any more of that stuff
[22522.48s -> 22523.68s]  Do I?

[22526.71s -> 22528.88s]  oh well
[22528.88s -> 22532.08s]  I walked right into that. I saw it coming from a mile away. I knew it
[22532.64s -> 22535.04s]  Was staring at it. I just walked into it
[22537.89s -> 22582.96s]  Back up that scared the shit out of me. Did he bumped into me or something? I need some ammo for
[22583.68s -> 22586.05s]  the shotgun
[22586.05s -> 22591.28s]  I needed to do it. I still have resurrections. That's good
[22598.02s -> 22599.46s]  Nice, dude
[22599.46s -> 22604.05s]  Can I give him the flamethrower?
[22604.05s -> 22606.05s]  No, how do I approach this?
[22606.45s -> 22614.74s]  I have to just shoot them
[22614.74s -> 22626.40s]  They don't have any weapons, right? I'm gonna take the critter upper
[22632.45s -> 22633.25s]  Yeah
[22633.25s -> 22670.87s]  It was worth it that one that one that one that one or the grenade both will work. Good. Good. Good. Good

[22719.32s -> 22722.44s]  It actually has been three for three even if I didn't die to the robot
[22723.08s -> 22725.88s]  The robot's presence causes me to panic every single time
[22726.68s -> 22729.04s]  I gotta get over it with Jax though
[22733.70s -> 22737.06s]  This one was terrible too. You only get three minutes to do three bombs across the whole map

[22825.72s -> 22837.46s]  Something like that

[23400.10s -> 23405.94s]  I almost just walked right into that. Okay, i'm gonna steal ammo from the cop. He does not have a gun anymore
[23405.94s -> 23407.94s]  He's annoyed about losing his gun
[23409.28s -> 23411.41s]  Okay

[23843.00s -> 23850.10s]  I had to know what that did. All right
[23850.10s -> 23857.00s]  Another mission over here and isn't does he hate me? No, he can't hate me because he has a mission
[23857.64s -> 23862.44s]  All right. I'm out of money
[23864.32s -> 23865.84s]  rescue the doctor
[23865.84s -> 23866.96s]  I'll try

[23912.77s -> 23923.73s]  I'm doing this job for you. Why are you coming out here? He's got it by the train
[23924.21s -> 23929.40s]  Like I took the money. All right, don't care
[23929.48s -> 23938.71s]  Come on out

[24069.32s -> 24071.32s]  Shuriken will be instant kill
[24071.32s -> 24074.04s]  I just need to make sure I have some shurikens. Do I I have four?
[24074.92s -> 24076.98s]  I need more of those

[24080.10s -> 24083.91s]  I'm gonna refill the shurikens and i'm gonna take that pill

[24089.08s -> 24091.88s]  All right, let's teleport. That's it. Right? Just this last one
[24092.76s -> 24094.76s]  Selamatic right there. Let's go
[24098.36s -> 24100.36s]  Play mambo number five or riot
[24102.61s -> 24108.53s]  No, i'm not gonna have this whole stream get dmca'd this whole stream is gonna get muted because of one dumb song that
[24111.28s -> 24114.48s]  Yeah, I called it a dumb song. I did i'm sorry if you like it
[24115.20s -> 24118.21s]  All right, we're gonna neutralize this guy
[24119.67s -> 24124.05s]  There are no front door
[24124.05s -> 24128.08s]  Hand over your cash
[24128.08s -> 24131.60s]  That's just great cause fucking all kinds of problems. What do I what should I do about this?
[24132.56s -> 24160.61s]  Machine gun. All right selamatic time and give me that chest
[24163.62s -> 24176.36s]  Who's that? What? Oh
[24176.60s -> 24178.36s]  Five dollars. Ooh
[24178.36s -> 24193.28s]  This is super good
[24193.28s -> 24207.94s]  All right, that's it. I wouldn't do the selamatic though. Where is it over here? I'm not gonna let you take that's the accuracy mode is
[24208.02s -> 24210.02s]  Is too good like get out of here
[24210.58s -> 24220.52s]  It's the scratch offs all over again. All right. Am I allowed in here?
[24221.96s -> 24223.96s]  I'm definitely allowed in there if I use the toilet
[24224.44s -> 24242.60s]  I'm never gonna get it. No, just leave
[24242.60s -> 24251.88s]  Mixed up environment mutator unlocked. They're all
[24252.44s -> 24253.40s]  Okay
[24253.40s -> 24258.07s]  If I die, I have to play mambo number five. Okay
[24258.95s -> 24272.84s]  The whole song or like 12 seconds?
[24279.04s -> 24280.58s]  Oh shit
[24280.58s -> 24284.02s]  Don't pick this one. Do not pick this one. It ends every time
[24286.13s -> 24290.61s]  It's gonna end again and i'm at the end. I have one more more to do
[24293.16s -> 24295.16s]  Give me something easy
[24295.16s -> 24300.07s]  Give me the ooze. The ooze is so easy. Give this to me
[24300.71s -> 24302.08s]  This is
[24302.08s -> 24303.28s]  It's over
[24303.28s -> 24315.08s]  And I don't have any food. Wait, I just thought of a genius idea
[24316.37s -> 24318.28s]  Let me come over here
[24318.28s -> 24319.72s]  Come on over here
[24319.72s -> 24322.34s]  Do I have shurikens? I do. Okay
[24323.06s -> 24325.76s]  um
[24325.76s -> 24327.46s]  Get over here
[24327.46s -> 24328.98s]  I'm waiting for you
[24328.98s -> 24338.26s]  I need to land one
[24338.26s -> 24340.26s]  One shot it has to hit
[24341.25s -> 24342.53s]  And i'm good
[24342.53s -> 24377.01s]  How long does it last for?
[24377.25s -> 24381.21s]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is mambo number five
[24404.24s -> 24406.24s]  Be a buzz like I had last week
[24406.32s -> 24414.66s]  I must stay deep because talk is cheap. All as I continue, you know, they're getting sweeter
[24414.98s -> 24421.30s]  So what can I do? I really beg you my lord to me learn this just like a sport anything fly
[24421.54s -> 24427.46s]  It's all good. Let me jump in please send in the trumpet a little bit of Monica in my life
[24427.78s -> 24432.90s]  A little bit of erika by my side a little bit of Rita's all I need
[24433.30s -> 24436.37s]  A little bit
[24442.39s -> 24444.39s]  The song sucks
[24444.47s -> 24447.41s]  What a dumb song
[24448.05s -> 24453.57s]  Deep fake that wasn't even me. I didn't even just do that. Somebody just turned somebody to just just fucking hack the computer
[24453.73s -> 24458.29s]  And put a deep fake on camera. That's what i'm talking about. That shit sucks. It's bullshit. I didn't do that
[24466.36s -> 24468.36s]  I can't believe somebody made that deep fake
[24472.53s -> 24475.57s]  I
[24475.57s -> 24478.69s]  Why do I have to lose every time to the fucking robot?
[24479.41s -> 24483.59s]  But let me lay I have some defense here on your offense. I've got defense
[24484.61s -> 24486.37s]  that item says
[24486.37s -> 24489.49s]  That is it. It instantly kills an enemy, right?
[24490.37s -> 24496.48s]  It was like take the instant kill for throwing stuff, right?
[24497.28s -> 24503.40s]  What do you mean wrong item?
[24503.40s -> 24505.40s]  No, look at look look look look. Where is it?
[24506.04s -> 24517.80s]  That's misleading. That's a misleading thing. What's it called?
[24518.60s -> 24524.12s]  Killer throw everyone wanted to be able to throw things at people and make them explode into giblets to live your dreams
[24524.92s -> 24528.36s]  so it's not
[24528.36s -> 24531.88s]  Killer thrower that so it doesn't say instantly kills them
[24539.81s -> 24541.81s]  But yeah, it doesn't say instant kill
[24543.56s -> 24545.56s]  Yeah, it doesn't shit
[24546.90s -> 24551.88s]  Oh, I was so close to stop picking the robot. It's causing me anxiety
[24555.11s -> 24557.11s]  I'm never gonna get over the robot
[24557.67s -> 24564.47s]  All right
[24564.47s -> 24566.47s]  No, no, that's it. That's it
[24566.71s -> 24570.40s]  We've been going for seven hours
[24571.38s -> 24577.57s]  Fucking robot. So tomorrow i'll see you for the comb stream
[24579.60s -> 24582.96s]  I said false song. I didn't say false song. I said I was gonna do for like 12 seconds
[24585.33s -> 24587.00s]  Yeah, it got late
[24587.00s -> 24588.68s]  Thanks for saying this game's fun
[24588.68s -> 24593.20s]  I would play this one again
[24593.20s -> 24595.06s]  If you enjoyed it
[24595.06s -> 24597.06s]  but I mean
[24597.06s -> 24600.50s]  Uh checking it out first impressions with germa 985
[24601.14s -> 24605.75s]  It's pretty fun. It seems like you can dump
[24606.84s -> 24609.16s]  Uh, like at least 20 to 40 hours into this game
[24609.80s -> 24612.55s]  It's pretty cool
[24612.55s -> 24615.86s]  But yeah tomorrow we're gonna do comb stream. We're gonna do uh more tier lists
[24616.50s -> 24619.65s]  I'm gonna lip sync the entire mambo number five song
[24620.53s -> 24625.89s]  From start to finish
[24625.89s -> 24627.89s]  And we'll do some flash game. We'll just hang out
[24628.29s -> 24630.23s]  It's like a whatever stream
[24630.23s -> 24632.87s]  Should be fun
[24632.87s -> 24635.35s]  Uh, the internet still seems to be an issue
[24636.39s -> 24637.19s]  but
[24637.19s -> 24639.99s]  At least I don't have five vods this time
[24641.80s -> 24644.68s]  Because before they fixed one of the there's probably two or three different problems
[24645.48s -> 24647.03s]  but
[24647.03s -> 24648.39s]  We dropped
[24648.39s -> 24651.99s]  20 000 frames in seven hours, which is just barely
[24652.79s -> 24654.79s]  at that level of
[24655.50s -> 24657.92s]  tolerable
[24657.92s -> 24660.56s]  Anything over like one percent drop frames would be
[24662.16s -> 24668.12s]  Let's hope it improves as we continue to go over the next few days
[24672.08s -> 24675.86s]  It was good. It was all right
[24675.86s -> 24678.18s]  Don't listen to this deep fake promising us thing
[24678.82s -> 24683.04s]  All right, let's uh
[24683.04s -> 24684.16s]  Let's call it
[24684.16s -> 24689.32s]  That's a perfect time to stop I think because starting a new run would be like another 40 50 minutes
[24689.32s -> 24690.84s]  And it's getting late
[24690.84s -> 24698.15s]  So let's go back earlier. Let's do the uh bits
[24698.95s -> 24701.84s]  and we had
[24701.84s -> 24704.88s]  two dollars and fifty cents from um well dough and well dough
[24705.60s -> 24708.02s]  Hey derma, i'd be surprised if no one has suggested this yet
[24708.58s -> 24710.58s]  But you should definitely contact
[24711.30s -> 24714.26s]  Michael reeves and william osmond to help with your carnival stream
[24714.90s -> 24717.94s]  Alongside the robotics team if you haven't heard of them look them up on youtube
[24720.13s -> 24722.69s]  Uh, unfortunately this robotics stream
[24723.65s -> 24725.65s]  There are two different
[24725.95s -> 24727.95s]  Companies that are involved
[24727.97s -> 24735.41s]  One of them is handling the actual engineering and building of the robots and the other one is handling the stream stuff
[24736.21s -> 24738.21s]  I mean i'm like grand
[24738.61s -> 24743.09s]  Uh the overseer or whatever. I'm like the executive producer, I guess you could say
[24744.05s -> 24746.05s]  But there's a couple of teams
[24746.13s -> 24748.13s]  That are working underneath
[24748.21s -> 24750.21s]  Essentially everything that i've said I wanted to do
[24750.45s -> 24752.45s]  So I really already have
[24753.40s -> 24757.96s]  A whole company, you know team of people who are going to be doing like the stream portion
[24758.60s -> 24760.60s]  and I don't think I have
[24760.68s -> 24765.72s]  the necessary resources to contact anybody else or have anybody else come on board or
[24766.60s -> 24767.48s]  um
[24767.48s -> 24770.48s]  There's a lot of moving parts
[24770.48s -> 24772.48s]  How can you afford all this?
[24772.56s -> 24776.04s]  uh
[24776.04s -> 24777.62s]  I
[24777.62s -> 24780.26s]  I kind of I kind of just don't give a fuck about all that
[24784.45s -> 24785.91s]  I'm doing
[24785.91s -> 24788.53s]  Just fine. You know what I mean?
[24794.07s -> 24795.27s]  Uh, I
[24795.27s -> 24797.83s]  The money that I make and the money that I put into this stream
[24798.63s -> 24804.07s]  I would rather put a shitload of money into a stream and still be doing just fine, which I will be
[24804.87s -> 24807.11s]  so don't worry about
[24807.35s -> 24809.03s]  my monetary
[24809.03s -> 24814.71s]  And my financials because I've ran the numbers a bunch of times if I'm saving a lot of money, so don't worry
[24815.43s -> 24817.43s]  But I really don't care about
[24817.83s -> 24819.43s]  trying to
[24819.43s -> 24821.43s]  Maximize my profits on twitch
[24822.07s -> 24825.59s]  If it means that I get to potentially do and stream
[24826.55s -> 24827.83s]  one of the
[24827.83s -> 24830.39s]  Most interesting things I think I've at least personally ever done
[24831.35s -> 24832.71s]  on camera
[24832.71s -> 24836.23s]  Then I want to do it like that. That's it's worth it to me to be able to do something like that and try
[24837.99s -> 24842.15s]  So
[24842.15s -> 24845.19s]  Tingy thanks for the 10 community subs right at the end here. Thank you so much tingy
[24847.52s -> 24849.52s]  That's where you get your money
[24850.05s -> 24852.05s]  That 10 community subs just came in
[24853.70s -> 24857.62s]  But if i'm able to do this look I want to look back in 10 20 years
[24858.18s -> 24862.42s]  When i'm done with this maybe all together. I'll be like i'll be like fucking 50 guys
[24863.22s -> 24865.22s]  I'll be like 60 years old
[24865.81s -> 24870.21s]  I personally want to just be like hey, remember when I did that and yeah, it costed some money, but
[24871.25s -> 24873.25s]  It was worth it. It was where it was a lot of fun
[24873.41s -> 24877.49s]  And it was a big like community fun event. I don't care about
[24878.29s -> 24881.81s]  Trying to well, you know, hold on. I can like keep that buddy
[24882.77s -> 24895.33s]  No, it's worth doing this it'll be fun when I spent two dollars whenever I spent a two dollar bill on that carnival
[24901.20s -> 24903.20s]  Another 30 years
[24904.07s -> 24905.67s]  I don't know about that
[24905.67s -> 24910.69s]  Two. No, not two billion
[24910.69s -> 24914.47s]  Don't ever stop streaming for the rest of your life
[24915.81s -> 24916.93s]  hmm
[24916.93s -> 24922.93s]  I don't have any immediate plans, but I don't know. I don't know if i'm gonna be the like
[24923.89s -> 24926.37s]  55 year old 60 year old guy on here
[24933.57s -> 24935.57s]  Why not? I don't know that's
[24936.85s -> 24941.65s]  I'm gonna like retire somewhere. I don't know. I have no idea how long i'll be doing this
[24942.63s -> 24945.27s]  I don't have any plan or any goals
[24945.91s -> 24948.05s]  with this
[24948.05s -> 24950.61s]  I'm just gonna keep doing it until I don't think it's fun anymore
[24952.76s -> 24954.76s]  That could be 50 years
[24956.40s -> 24958.40s]  It might not be I don't know
[24967.00s -> 24969.00s]  Cry if you retire
[24969.00s -> 24973.00s]  By the time that I stop streaming or really really really dial back completely
[24973.96s -> 24976.69s]  It'll
[24976.69s -> 24978.69s]  It's it's gonna be a while from now
[24990.76s -> 24994.12s]  All right. Uh, this is that's a this is a very normal thing
[24995.00s -> 25000.69s]  Hold on. So so me telling you guys, you know, you might get
[25001.73s -> 25003.97s]  It might be 20 more years of this
[25004.77s -> 25005.81s]  No
[25005.81s -> 25009.40s]  We'll think of it this way, right? How long did your favorite tv show run for?
[25011.33s -> 25014.29s]  I'm of the opinion and I I truly believe this
[25014.85s -> 25017.09s]  That there's a time to end the tv show
[25017.89s -> 25025.49s]  Because all the tv shows that go on for more than like 10 to 20 seasons
[25026.69s -> 25028.69s]  they
[25029.08s -> 25032.60s]  They start to lose why they were interesting in the first place, I think
[25038.47s -> 25043.76s]  After like the 9 to 15 seasons
[25044.64s -> 25046.64s]  Because it might be time to wrap it up, you know
[25050.16s -> 25052.08s]  20 seasons
[25052.08s -> 25056.29s]  Twitch is a lot different than television, but you know the same
[25057.80s -> 25060.92s]  I actually was having this conversation with italics the other day and
[25062.52s -> 25064.12s]  We were talking about this
[25064.12s -> 25066.12s]  Okay, so let's so twitch, right?
[25067.03s -> 25069.75s]  What what happens when you play every game, you know?
[25070.55s -> 25072.55s]  It's like a fossil fuel
[25073.32s -> 25077.40s]  When you do everything what happens if you do everything like 10 years from now you played every game
[25078.12s -> 25082.15s]  Every game that's worth playing
[25082.79s -> 25084.79s]  We just have to wait for the new ones
[25087.04s -> 25091.44s]  They make new ones. Yeah, but i'm just saying like what what happens when you do everything?
[25094.96s -> 25096.96s]  Prepare for more irl
[25097.20s -> 25101.30s]  Yeah, but I already told you guys. I don't i'm not gonna do irl streams unless they're
[25103.04s -> 25104.16s]  bits
[25104.16s -> 25113.25s]  I'm not walking around with the selfie camera out of like the subway and be like hey
[25113.33s -> 25117.65s]  So guys don't like the subway doors like clothes on the fucking selfie stick like oh shit
[25118.21s -> 25121.09s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Stop the train. Stop the train. I'm not doing that
[25126.20s -> 25128.20s]  You're doing an irl stream tomorrow
[25129.57s -> 25132.45s]  Yeah, but it's it's it's different because I it's
[25133.25s -> 25137.01s]  I don't do it that often and there's nothing wrong with that. I have nothing wrong with an irl stream
[25137.01s -> 25142.61s]  I'm just saying I I don't want to do that. I don't want to every day like walk around vegas
[25143.41s -> 25144.93s]  I don't want to do that
[25144.93s -> 25158.61s]  I'd rather do something else. Let me comb my hair on stream. Yeah, when was the last comb stream?
[25159.17s -> 25163.01s]  Two like two years ago
[25163.25s -> 25164.93s]  A year and a half ago
[25164.93s -> 25170.26s]  It was a year ago that I combed my hair on stream and just hung out
[25173.84s -> 25180.72s]  So come on
[25180.72s -> 25186.56s]  Is this the guy who's saying mambo number five into his comb like it was a microphone?
[25187.28s -> 25190.16s]  Yes
[25190.16s -> 25192.16s]  But long story short
[25192.40s -> 25194.40s]  Don't worry about my financials
[25195.04s -> 25201.84s]  We might fuck around here a lot, but i'm gonna make sure that i'm not gonna cause myself any problems
[25201.84s -> 25203.84s]  It's not gonna be an issue
[25204.32s -> 25206.32s]  I'm gonna be just fine. So don't worry
[25206.56s -> 25208.40s]  I appreciate the concern though
[25208.40s -> 25210.92s]  I'm looking forward to it. It'll be fun
[25210.92s -> 25212.92s]  But let's keep going with the bits
[25214.42s -> 25219.70s]  Stop dropping coins. I'm doing that. I'm okay. That's subconscious. I'm just picking coins up off the because they were a mess
[25222.07s -> 25225.19s]  I did this I did this little like uh thing where uh
[25225.83s -> 25228.55s]  Joel called me after vine bristle and I pretended
[25229.51s -> 25236.69s]  Because that's a spoiler. I was cheating but I like he like rolls of coins in my hands. That's a spoiler
[25236.69s -> 25241.68s]  We're not going to spoil this here
[25241.68s -> 25243.68s]  He's counting his money. We got one
[25243.84s -> 25244.72s]  two
[25244.72s -> 25246.72s]  Three that's a dollar right there
[25247.84s -> 25250.72s]  Anyways, uh, thank you to lewd sheep for the three bucks. Hey
[25251.28s -> 25256.08s]  Jermbo this message is so that you notice a creative person called yen wen len who made great art
[25257.36s -> 25259.36s]  Find their message if you can
[25259.60s -> 25260.88s]  Or did
[25260.88s -> 25262.64s]  And ignore this once you do
[25262.64s -> 25264.00s]  Yeah, we put uh
[25264.00s -> 25266.88s]  yen wen has insane incredible art we put yen wen's
[25267.52s -> 25270.80s]  art up on the screen pretty much any chance we get it's
[25271.76s -> 25275.04s]  It's incredibly detailed. It's it's perfect. It's fantastic
[25276.00s -> 25281.76s]  And there's not much else I could say that's uh more than that. So we usually check it out every time
[25283.36s -> 25285.36s]  And i'm sure we'll probably come across it if it's here
[25289.28s -> 25291.20s]  But thank you lewd sheep
[25291.20s -> 25294.88s]  Uh trotter. Thanks for the 250. Hey germaine. I just got my one year sub badge

[25302.16s -> 25304.16s]  German fireman, so am I

[25320.04s -> 25325.16s]  That's 12 straight months that you have decided that I am worth your five dollars a buck

[25330.87s -> 25332.71s]  Thank you
[25332.71s -> 25337.80s]  And that goes to all of you
[25337.80s -> 25341.80s]  Thank you abomination zero for the five dollars and ten cents germa. I need your help with a magic trick
[25341.80s -> 25347.24s]  Can you act like you're playing and then show yourself holding up the three of clubs and say is this your card?
[25348.20s -> 25356.21s]  Uh, yeah, okay
[25356.21s -> 25365.88s]  Watch out. Watch out tunnel tunnel tunnel tunnel tunnel got him
[25367.62s -> 25370.82s]  Is this your card?
[25370.82s -> 25374.87s]  it's no
[25374.87s -> 25376.39s]  Apparently not
[25376.39s -> 25391.08s]  There you go. What if you want to do with it? Go ahead. Thank you for the five dollars and ten cents
[25391.08s -> 25393.80s]  Thank you the lemonade parade for the ten dollars
[25395.14s -> 25399.92s]  Oh, wait a minute here. Thank you for the ten bucks. First of all and second of all
[25400.64s -> 25403.44s]  Tried the tuna and pretzel thing you said to try
[25404.40s -> 25407.03s]  It changed my life
[25407.27s -> 25411.11s]  Knew somebody and knew it
[25411.35s -> 25413.35s]  All you had to do is taste it
[25413.51s -> 25415.27s]  and realize
[25415.27s -> 25417.89s]  I hope more of you do that
[25417.97s -> 25421.54s]  Tuna i'm talking tuna like from the can
[25422.34s -> 25426.74s]  With mayonnaise whipped up crushed up like it's gonna go in a sandwich. Don't put it in the sandwich
[25427.22s -> 25433.70s]  Get pretzel sticks or a regular pretzel doesn't matter crispy ones and slide it smear it on the with the tuna eat it
[25434.50s -> 25435.70s]  Trust me
[25435.78s -> 25440.42s]  Uh does she do it do it. I don't care if you try it once and then you hate it
[25441.06s -> 25443.06s]  Come tell me you hated it
[25443.54s -> 25445.54s]  Because we got the lemonade parade
[25445.62s -> 25447.62s]  Uh just said that they it was amazing
[25450.26s -> 25451.46s]  And that's one
[25451.46s -> 25455.92s]  They were like 4,800 people on that stream. So one out of uh, 5 000 is
[25456.48s -> 25461.52s]  Okay, but that's not a very good number. But still nobody said it wasn't nobody came here and said it was bad
[25462.40s -> 25470.39s]  Uh, thank you frody weapon for the 250. Hey germ congrats on your vine
[25471.35s -> 25473.60s]  Wrestle participation
[25473.60s -> 25477.28s]  That's right. I was in it. It was a lot of fun. We're not gonna do any spoilers
[25477.84s -> 25479.84s]  Because there are people that may not have seen it yet
[25480.56s -> 25483.46s]  They want to watch it
[25483.46s -> 25484.44s]  so
[25484.44s -> 25488.92s]  Thank you. It was i'm honored that I was even considered to be part of it in the first place

[25505.40s -> 25511.43s]  Yes, it is
[25511.43s -> 25518.61s]  I have not seen that movie in a long time. I remember it being a very good movie though
[25519.17s -> 25523.97s]  That was when christian bale was really starting to kind of become
[25525.08s -> 25527.08s]  an a-list actor, right
[25527.80s -> 25531.44s]  uh, we have
[25531.44s -> 25533.44s]  two dollars and 50 cents from snooze
[25535.24s -> 25536.92s]  And snooze says
[25536.92s -> 25541.73s]  Hey germ, I doodled some of your pals a few days ago and people in the discord seemed to like it
[25541.73s -> 25543.25s]  So i'll send it your way
[25543.25s -> 25550.56s]  There it is
[25550.56s -> 25552.56s]  I love how shito has legs
[25553.12s -> 25554.96s]  Shido is a scorpion
[25554.96s -> 25560.64s]  That's very cute. Anyways, your streams are such genuine positive points in my week
[25561.12s -> 25564.80s]  And although I can't give back a lot, please know how much they mean to me and so many others

[25575.96s -> 25577.64s]  I am forever
[25577.64s -> 25580.60s]  forever grateful that that people think that people think that this
[25581.40s -> 25583.40s]  Stuff that happens on this stream is worth drawing
[25584.93s -> 25587.17s]  fan art for or community art for
[25591.04s -> 25593.36s]  Sometimes I can't believe it and it

[25613.83s -> 25616.15s]  Thank you everybody that contributes all the time
[25616.95s -> 25619.36s]  To this channel you make it what it is
[25627.97s -> 25630.56s]  Wear bots
[25630.56s -> 25632.56s]  I don't believe that
[25632.56s -> 25638.71s]  Am I a deep fake?
[25638.87s -> 25640.23s]  I don't know
[25640.23s -> 25642.85s]  I don't think so
[25642.85s -> 25646.05s]  This whole stream could have been a deep fake and you would never know but snooze
[25646.69s -> 25649.89s]  That's uh, very very very awesome stuff. Thank you for the art
[25651.72s -> 25654.68s]  i'm kind of realizing that shito and fireman could be
[25656.24s -> 25659.04s]  related somehow
[25659.04s -> 25661.44s]  Somewhere down the road
[25661.44s -> 25664.08s]  But thank you for that
[25664.08s -> 25666.08s]  whole of one zombie. Thanks for the five dollars

[25672.72s -> 25690.13s]  This shit is fucking freaky
[25690.93s -> 25692.93s]  And also made one less creepy
[25693.88s -> 25700.98s]  less creepy
[25703.60s -> 25714.55s]  Uh by less creepy you mean somehow more creepy who comes up with this shit
[25716.37s -> 25725.84s]  How do you even make a program that's capable of doing that it's the eyes the eyes are freaking me out
[25735.72s -> 25737.72s]  Yeah, I don't know what it is about the eyes
[25738.32s -> 25740.32s]  One of them's like off
[25740.64s -> 25742.24s]  My eyes look like that
[25744.04s -> 25746.04s]  But thank you whole of one zombie
[25746.12s -> 25748.12s]  Hey lazy luke. Thanks for the 250
[25749.33s -> 25756.13s]  In the past five months your streams have been there've been 4.6 million messages in your chat
[25757.95s -> 25760.77s]  43,912 unique users chatting
[25761.81s -> 25765.57s]  And 10,387 unique emotes used
[25766.29s -> 25768.29s]  Just some numbers that I happened to come across
[25771.27s -> 25774.23s]  It's a lot 4.6 million messages
[25775.19s -> 25778.58s]  That's almost five million
[25779.30s -> 25785.27s]  That's that's almost a million messages a month all me on other accounts
[25788.48s -> 25792.20s]  You got a lot of accounts then
[25792.28s -> 25803.65s]  Interesting data. Thank you. Lazy move. I thank you
[25804.35s -> 25808.69s]  Stiff funky the funky chicken or stiff funky chicken. Thank you
[25809.81s -> 25814.72s]  You mentioned you had a an idea for setting aside stream time for your videos. Yes
[25815.36s -> 25818.72s]  The stream ended before you could finish the thought right? Right. That's right. I forgot about that
[25821.24s -> 25824.92s]  I was about seconds away from talking about how I wanted to start to do a thing
[25825.64s -> 25827.64s]  And the internet turned up
[25832.13s -> 25834.13s]  So let me actually go over that real quickly
[25835.48s -> 25838.12s]  Because so many people give so much interesting stuff on these streams
[25839.25s -> 25841.25s]  I would rather set up
[25841.25s -> 25843.68s]  like once or twice a month
[25843.68s -> 25845.04s]  a
[25845.04s -> 25849.36s]  Community video night community art night kind of bunch them all together
[25850.24s -> 25854.98s]  So we can do them all
[25854.98s -> 25859.46s]  Because it seems like every couple streams is like another video that's somebody spent a lot of time on
[25860.10s -> 25862.98s]  There's some artwork that people have submitted into
[25863.62s -> 25865.62s]  the creative channel in the discord
[25866.02s -> 25868.02s]  I think that maybe once or twice a month
[25868.26s -> 25869.94s]  doing a
[25869.94s -> 25871.14s]  Hey look
[25871.14s -> 25875.62s]  There's like five or six videos and like 12 pieces of artwork
[25876.18s -> 25879.46s]  And just for like an hour or so either before or after a stream just go over it
[25882.99s -> 25884.99s]  Especially especially
[25885.47s -> 25887.07s]  The video stuff
[25887.07s -> 25890.99s]  Because it really feels like oh, hey jerma his video. All right, let's uh, put it on right now
[25891.55s -> 25893.55s]  And maybe there's not as many people here
[25893.55s -> 25897.31s]  They maybe would want to see it too. And if they knew that it was oh, he's gonna do video stuff
[25897.95s -> 25899.95s]  Then maybe they would stick around for it
[25900.51s -> 25905.81s]  But that's what I was gonna talk about before
[25905.81s -> 25907.81s]  But in case let me see
[25909.71s -> 25911.71s]  I want to see a yen when
[25914.74s -> 25918.22s]  I have some art links. Let me make sure that I can get these open
[25918.78s -> 25928.51s]  Um, no, I can't wait to see this I got the links now
[25931.79s -> 25939.60s]  Oh man, this is awesome. This is fucking awesome
[25945.25s -> 25947.25s]  All right, let me get these on the screen because these are great
[25949.97s -> 25953.01s]  Let's see, this is gonna be probably really high resolution. See if we can get it on here
[25954.21s -> 25956.29s]  This is uh what yen when it says
[25957.09s -> 25960.05s]  What they imagine the carnival stream what I would look like on the carnival stream
[25961.01s -> 25976.98s]  You might be and you might be pretty close let's get it on there man
[25981.97s -> 25993.55s]  I need to have like a better system for this too
[25995.95s -> 25997.95s]  Because my files are like all over the place
[26000.38s -> 26003.18s]  Is my windows crashing right now? What are you doing?
[26004.06s -> 26015.12s]  Here we go. Ready?
[26020.70s -> 26029.15s]  Let's get a good view of this
[26029.47s -> 26031.47s]  You might be onto something here
[26031.63s -> 26043.02s]  Let's get let's get right into the face the eyebrows are the best
[26051.57s -> 26053.57s]  I can't wait to do that stream
[26055.66s -> 26057.58s]  I want nothing more than to have that done
[26058.22s -> 26060.42s]  now
[26060.42s -> 26062.42s]  All in due time. It'll be worth the wait
[26062.74s -> 26065.94s]  And then here's another one. Let's go. Djerba base face
[26066.50s -> 26071.38s]  Which is the start of it. This is kind of what I would look like without the
[26074.19s -> 26084.70s]  Makeup on I don't know how some of you. I don't know how some of you guys get this detail
[26093.68s -> 26097.14s]  It's so good
[26099.10s -> 26102.06s]  Thank you so much for these. Yeah, man, they're awesome as always
[26103.55s -> 26107.63s]  We see what I mean. Like I want I this is doing this like once every month or so
[26108.35s -> 26111.98s]  Would be great
[26111.98s -> 26115.74s]  With videos or other it doesn't have to be just art or just videos. It could be anything
[26116.38s -> 26122.14s]  But those are fantastic. Thank you so much
[26123.95s -> 26126.59s]  So much time so much energy and so much effort went into those
[26127.39s -> 26129.39s]  And all the other art that I get
[26129.71s -> 26130.91s]  and videos
[26130.91s -> 26134.59s]  Some of you guys spend weeks on shit and I wish there was more I could say
[26136.43s -> 26140.11s]  Some of you guys are so talented. Thank you so much for this fucking incredible stuff
[26147.07s -> 26149.30s]  Damn

[26289.46s -> 26290.56s]  rimworld
[26290.56s -> 26292.56s]  factorio space station
[26293.20s -> 26295.20s]  space station 13
[26295.28s -> 26298.16s]  Yeah, i've heard of space station 13
[26298.16s -> 26300.16s]  And then he said shout out to seph
[26301.32s -> 26302.46s]  zentich
[26302.46s -> 26304.30s]  This was a fun stream
[26304.30s -> 26313.52s]  It was a fun game
[26313.52s -> 26315.20s]  I very much enjoyed it
[26315.20s -> 26319.69s]  It's kind of a more of a play the game and hang out with chat kind of stream
[26320.65s -> 26322.56s]  But those are
[26322.56s -> 26324.56s]  I I had blessed it was great
[26324.56s -> 26327.87s]  It's a good experience
[26327.87s -> 26332.27s]  Thank you tingy for the 250. I missed the old germa the one that always had an end of stream joke
[26332.75s -> 26335.79s]  Not this new germa will all we get is an end of stream voice
[26339.68s -> 26343.95s]  All right, fine
[26343.95s -> 26345.28s]  All right
[26345.28s -> 26349.04s]  Fine you want to get i'll do it now, but now you know what's happening and it's over
[26352.89s -> 26356.57s]  Thank you tingy. Thank you tingy for your 10 subs too. We came with a lot of subs earlier
[26358.12s -> 26360.12s]  And those subs are going to be on the screen right now
[26365.48s -> 26367.48s]  I can't really express
[26369.00s -> 26371.85s]  how
[26371.85s -> 26373.85s]  how much I
[26373.85s -> 26375.85s]  Really really really appreciate
[26378.28s -> 26382.00s]  everybody's support here
[26382.00s -> 26386.40s]  Sometimes when you you know, if you're not live, this is a kind of a streamer insider thing
[26386.40s -> 26391.60s]  I'm sure other people have talked about but if you're not live for like four or five six days in a row
[26392.32s -> 26394.64s]  People tend to kind of drop off in subs
[26395.36s -> 26398.96s]  And that's fine. It's a bit perfectly understandable where you're not obligated to give anybody anything
[26399.60s -> 26401.44s]  money wise on the stream
[26401.44s -> 26402.96s]  But I noticed that
[26402.96s -> 26406.64s]  Almost nobody it stayed almost exactly the same for like a week ago
[26408.40s -> 26410.40s]  And I opened that up and I was like, holy shit
[26411.36s -> 26413.80s]  So
[26413.80s -> 26417.56s]  everybody that continues to sub to this channel even when i'm not live that's
[26420.16s -> 26422.08s]  I have no words
[26422.08s -> 26423.20s]  Thank you
[26423.20s -> 26434.30s]  Because that was one of the first things I noticed was like, oh, holy shit like nobody everybody's still here. You're all still here
[26439.10s -> 26444.86s]  Sometimes you get in your head as a streamer or a youtuber like oh, they're still gonna be here in a week or two
[26445.82s -> 26449.60s]  Thanks for being here. Why would they leave?
[26450.32s -> 26454.70s]  It's not that they wouldn't or they would it's just that sometimes it's um
[26455.66s -> 26462.51s]  Goes through your head sometimes if people still having a good time. Is this still people are still having fun
[26463.07s -> 26466.62s]  Do people still like me?
[26466.62s -> 26468.62s]  So, thank you
[26468.78s -> 26472.96s]  They're gonna be on screen right now
[26472.96s -> 26481.10s]  Really appreciate it everybody
[26481.10s -> 26483.10s]  Two years and i'm still here. That's what I mean
[26483.98s -> 26486.84s]  That's a long time
[26486.84s -> 26498.70s]  He says how much you appreciate appreciate you as he counts his money
[26500.35s -> 26506.51s]  I remember you passed your prime, but we love you
[26507.79s -> 26508.99s]  That was
[26508.99s -> 26510.99s]  Just wait just
[26512.72s -> 26518.40s]  I know that i'm 34. You don't have to tell me i'm already very well aware of that
[26519.87s -> 26523.79s]  I'll be 35 in a year. Do you understand? I know that
[26528.03s -> 26531.31s]  You're not that old and then there it is get in my head again. I don't know what to do
[26534.91s -> 26536.91s]  I'm not 34. Haha. Take that
[26537.31s -> 26547.72s]  No

[26762.32s -> 26764.32s]  You know what i'm talking about. I don't even say anymore
[26764.80s -> 26773.00s]  Got to end this doctor's here, too
[26773.00s -> 26776.92s]  How many times has a bit message come in that says hey germa, i'm a fucking doctor
[26777.79s -> 26779.31s]  i'm a scientist
[26779.31s -> 26782.54s]  I fly planes
[26782.54s -> 26784.44s]  It's almost it's like
[26784.44s -> 26786.44s]  75 of every message
[26796.10s -> 26799.94s]  But I can't help it I if there's things to play with in front of me i'm going to play with them

[26835.75s -> 26838.47s]  plane flyers
[26838.55s -> 26842.71s]  Pilot, you know, they gravitate towards this stream. Why why are there so many doctors here?
[26857.96s -> 26860.04s]  They're worried about you
[26860.04s -> 26865.56s]  Yeah, I heard about this guy chairman on at five. He's like we're getting fucked up. He had a bunch of like intestinal problems
[26865.88s -> 26868.12s]  Maybe I should probably check that out and see if I can help him
[26868.76s -> 26878.55s]  I'm being written down in like a textbook
[26887.08s -> 26889.08s]  Very thoughtful of you guys. Yeah
[26890.07s -> 26892.07s]  All right, let's let's keep going
[26894.41s -> 26896.41s]  Okay, you know when money stinks
[26898.95s -> 26901.11s]  Oh this this money stinks
[26902.55s -> 26905.51s]  That heavy heavy heavy like iron
[26906.95s -> 26908.95s]  Smell that like metal
[26909.03s -> 26912.71s]  Like sweaty hands metal smell. This is disgusting. I haven't even touched this
[26914.49s -> 26917.21s]  I I just picked it up and it just filled the whole room
[26927.86s -> 26929.86s]  I'm gonna wash this money. Is that weird?
[26930.74s -> 26936.12s]  Would it be weird if you just filled up a little bowl of soapy water and watched the money?
[26942.22s -> 26943.74s]  Is that weird?
[26943.74s -> 26945.98s]  Why would that be weird?
[26946.14s -> 26948.86s]  I don't want germs on my hands from the money from all the random people
[26949.50s -> 26954.17s]  You know how many people probably look, you know, how many people probably touched this quarter?
[26956.55s -> 26959.50s]  A lot probably
[26959.50s -> 26961.50s]  This is probably at least a handful of people that touch that
[26961.98s -> 26964.86s]  Probably like 50
[26967.53s -> 26973.11s]  I don't know how many people think touch this penny. I don't think touch these quarters
[26973.99s -> 26976.92s]  He's a fucking magician. He's pretty damn good
[26981.67s -> 26983.67s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey
[26984.46s -> 26985.58s]  Hey
[26985.58s -> 26987.75s]  How many people think touch this penny?
[26988.87s -> 26990.87s]  No strings. I don't have strings here
[26991.58s -> 26995.08s]  No strings
[26995.08s -> 26996.60s]  I'll prove it
[26996.60s -> 27004.79s]  How many people touch this penny? I don't know you tell me guys
[27019.91s -> 27026.89s]  fake
[27026.89s -> 27030.84s]  I'm pretty fucking good
[27030.84s -> 27034.70s]  Hey
[27034.70s -> 27037.80s]  Hey
[27037.80s -> 27046.46s]  Hold on. Hey
[27046.46s -> 27049.34s]  Hey, nothing in my hands, right?
[27049.50s -> 27054.14s]  Nothing to me. Nothing in my hair. Nothing in the hair, right? No wires. No, nothing. Keep an eye on my hands
[27055.10s -> 27058.89s]  Got one
[27058.89s -> 27065.50s]  How did that happen?
[27065.50s -> 27075.22s]  You're gonna pull off your wig
[27083.62s -> 27085.62s]  All right, i'm fucking out of here
[27086.66s -> 27089.86s]  Thank you to uh, thank you to dubski dude for the 250
[27090.66s -> 27095.16s]  Hey germa the following is my most upvoted post on reddit surprisingly
[27095.16s -> 27101.24s]  But something tells me you and chat would enjoy it first link is an image second is a quick story. Both are stream safe
[27102.36s -> 27105.40s]  I love that's like a free text. Hey, everything's stream safe
[27106.04s -> 27111.54s]  Um, you didn't actually do this though, right?
[27112.94s -> 27114.62s]  germa doesn't
[27114.62s -> 27119.74s]  Mod me in the next 24 hours. I'm taking this picture at home depot and asking them what they think
[27120.70s -> 27125.74s]  This has 1.2. This has one almost one and a half thousand uploads
[27131.19s -> 27134.82s]  Okay, so wait
[27134.82s -> 27140.18s]  Yesterday I posted this pic demanding that I be modded or I unironically would visit home depot and show them the image
[27140.90s -> 27143.22s]  My demands were not met. The story is true
[27144.73s -> 27146.73s]  Everyone says that's the story is true
[27146.81s -> 27148.81s]  Uh right before his story is not true
[27149.53s -> 27154.76s]  I started up by printing the a aforementioned picture onto a seven by ten executive paper
[27155.24s -> 27158.60s]  Quality the print was a b-plus in my opinion, but it was lightly smeared by some
[27159.32s -> 27162.04s]  Rogue drops of cherry juice. I needed my vitamin c that morning
[27162.52s -> 27165.64s]  I couldn't redo the print as I had work in five hours and I didn't want to be late
[27166.36s -> 27169.72s]  It was the moment I found myself in my car only a few minutes from home depot
[27170.20s -> 27174.20s]  That I knew I had made a mistake. I'm just a regular person and these are people and not twitch chat
[27174.20s -> 27176.76s]  They can't even conceive of basic germa memes
[27177.48s -> 27181.32s]  This was just some depraved inside joke that I was about to take uh too far
[27181.40s -> 27187.00s]  I started to sweat and grip the steering wheel tightly but all I could think of was you missed that one try another
[27187.32s -> 27191.16s]  Playing over over and in my head. I wasn't gonna miss this one. Oh my god
[27192.44s -> 27202.07s]  I parked my car in a handicap zone. I'd only be there for a few hours. So no big deal. All right
[27202.87s -> 27208.65s]  Come on. I just needed to focus and take deep breaths else. I would have had no story to share with the subreddit
[27210.12s -> 27214.44s]  These upvotes are really important to me. What else would I derive my own self-worth from?
[27214.76s -> 27218.07s]  I
[27218.07s -> 27221.67s]  Entered the store and was hit with the trademark smell of fresh wood and paint thinner
[27222.23s -> 27226.58s]  It doesn't smell like that. I must have stepped in a puddle while walking in
[27227.06s -> 27231.86s]  But that was the least of my concerns. My knees had already started shaking and a crick in my neck was acting up
[27232.74s -> 27235.46s]  I felt like the terror. I was experiencing by what?
[27241.61s -> 27245.90s]  That the bathroom upholstery section was where I found myself
[27246.78s -> 27252.46s]  my anxiety would spike every time I came within five feet of another person and I tense up because I couldn't shake the thought that
[27252.86s -> 27257.58s]  Everyone knew why I was here and that they knew that I knew what they knew
[27257.74s -> 27261.58s]  I avoided eye contact at all costs and it would talk to myself out loud
[27262.06s -> 27267.90s]  Anytime someone would walk by and attempt to make it seem like I was preoccupied. This toilet is a b-plus. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
[27269.85s -> 27271.85s]  This is a long fucking story
[27272.57s -> 27278.09s]  As an afterthought I glanced towards the rental section. I saw an employee. They didn't seem busy. That was it
[27278.81s -> 27281.61s]  Uh, this was it. I had come so far already and I couldn't back out now
[27281.61s -> 27283.61s]  My knees began to visibly wobble
[27283.93s -> 27285.93s]  And my shoes were covered in paint thinner
[27286.41s -> 27289.13s]  Well, that was the puddle. Why hadn't they cleaned that off the floor?
[27289.37s -> 27294.33s]  Fuck, I don't know. But before I knew I was up in front of uh, this female home depot clerks, uh
[27295.85s -> 27298.65s]  She looked up at me with baby blue eyes. How can I help you?
[27303.85s -> 27307.29s]  It felt like all my internal organs had crowded into my throat. I was stunned
[27307.77s -> 27310.17s]  I didn't know what to say. What the hell was I doing here?
[27310.17s -> 27313.61s]  I had driven all this way to show some innocent person a photoshop picture of a twitch streamer
[27313.93s -> 27315.93s]  And I truly lost my damn mind the print
[27316.97s -> 27318.65s]  out of my hand
[27318.65s -> 27324.09s]  Was drenched in sweat cherry juice and paint thinner which had smeared the ink into a bizarre collage of colors and shapes
[27324.49s -> 27330.49s]  My hands were trembling but as I was on autopilot. I laid it on the counter and I said well, what do you think of this?
[27331.61s -> 27335.13s]  It felt like time had stopped I was done for I would never be able to live with myself after this
[27335.29s -> 27337.69s]  The employee squinted at the picture with a very confused look on her face
[27338.09s -> 27341.93s]  Is this she whispered and then paused the pause felt like an eternity
[27342.41s -> 27347.37s]  I should just turn and get out of the store. I should just leave now and undo the damage i'd done myself confidence
[27348.09s -> 27351.61s]  But my feet were like concrete the paint on my shoes was particularly thin at that point
[27352.49s -> 27354.49s]  Is this the streamer that died to pinwheel?
[27356.63s -> 27361.35s]  A huge burden. This is how you know the story ain't real a huge burden instantly rolled off my chest
[27361.35s -> 27364.15s]  I couldn't believe my luck another human being in my town that understood
[27364.71s -> 27369.11s]  We both began shouting the most obscure germa memes in the store and our celebration caused quite the scene
[27370.31s -> 27373.67s]  Customers began gathering in a crowd around us. It was twitch chat
[27373.67s -> 27380.47s]  They were pog champs and germa hearts and germa chomps bits rain like confetti and even nightbot was there muting a few people
[27380.55s -> 27382.55s]  Oh that nightbot
[27383.03s -> 27389.37s]  Okay, why am I reading this whole thing?
[27389.75s -> 27391.03s]  Why am I doing this?
[27391.03s -> 27395.99s]  But then the absolute worst thing imaginable happened the home depot manager drawn by the commotion stomped through the crowd
[27396.31s -> 27399.35s]  He had a grill master xbbq badge on his chest
[27401.00s -> 27403.00s]  He looked me dead in the eyes and said
[27403.98s -> 27406.30s]  Why the hell did you bother writing this entire thing?
[27408.02s -> 27411.94s]  I was dumbfounded. How did he know all I could do was turn to you the reader and ask you
[27412.42s -> 27414.79s]  Why did you read all this?
[27414.79s -> 27417.51s]  Your eyes drifted down the length of this final sentence in your brain
[27418.23s -> 27420.23s]  In your brain, you heard the word jubated
[27420.79s -> 27422.63s]  gg idiot
[27422.63s -> 27439.54s]  That's it. Remember we talked about deep fakes
[27442.71s -> 27444.71s]  in like 50 years
[27446.25s -> 27448.34s]  Like this story
[27448.34s -> 27450.34s]  Is just gonna be here
[27452.47s -> 27455.35s]  Somebody is gonna come across this somehow somewhere
[27456.23s -> 27457.99s]  100 years from now
[27457.99s -> 27459.99s]  And be like what the fuck happened here?
[27463.27s -> 27467.03s]  Who was this person that they're talking about who wrote this?
[27471.42s -> 27473.85s]  You know how many of these exist
[27473.85s -> 27475.05s]  this
[27475.05s -> 27477.05s]  The in like 200 years
[27478.50s -> 27480.66s]  People are gonna have so much trouble interpreting
[27481.64s -> 27493.62s]  Human history, you know, like we don't know really what the hell happened like fucking thousand years ago
[27495.27s -> 27497.59s]  We are reading like for I don't know like for instance, um
[27499.61s -> 27501.61s]  Like shit that happened in like the fucking 1400s
[27503.26s -> 27507.50s]  That shit was like written down and like spoken and passed down from person to person
[27508.06s -> 27512.94s]  Who knows if one of those stories that you heard about like king fucking edward the second or whatever
[27513.34s -> 27516.78s]  Could just be a a jubated twitch chat to somebody made it up for fun
[27518.39s -> 27527.40s]  How would you ever even know?
[27527.40s -> 27531.88s]  Who knows if half of this history the material in history could have just been a shit post
[27534.50s -> 27541.22s]  And they were laughing about it like could you imagine in 2000 years if they ever find the home depot story
[27545.66s -> 27551.42s]  In in fucking 500 years, there's gonna be an hbo special about this post
[27555.72s -> 27558.44s]  There'll be a seven-part mini series about this post
[27559.16s -> 27568.70s]  That's literally what mythology is
[27568.78s -> 27572.00s]  Yeah in the 500 years, we're gonna be the mythology
[27580.14s -> 27588.46s]  What is our legacy?
[27589.34s -> 27598.63s]  I'm worthy of being mythology
[27600.55s -> 27604.55s]  HBO is gonna be around in 500 years. What the fuck is gonna be around in 500 years?
[27605.43s -> 27608.31s]  Don't you kind of just want to know?
[27609.35s -> 27612.07s]  What's gonna be the most popular tv show in 500 years?
[27615.70s -> 27617.70s]  What is it gonna be? What is it?
[27619.05s -> 27621.05s]  What store are people gonna go into?
[27623.00s -> 27627.16s]  What's everybody's favorite food? What's the pizza of 500 years in the future?
[27628.12s -> 27630.22s]  Is it still pizza?
[27630.30s -> 27632.38s]  I mean pizzas lasted a pretty long damn time
[27633.51s -> 27635.51s]  people eating pizza like
[27635.91s -> 27638.97s]  Saint
[27638.97s -> 27640.49s]  Christopher Columbus
[27640.49s -> 27642.17s]  Was eating pizza
[27642.17s -> 27653.74s]  That's not that long ago
[27654.06s -> 27663.27s]  He was eating papa jobs
[27667.27s -> 27669.27s]  It's probably still gonna be pizza
[27670.38s -> 27677.10s]  And this home depot story do I genuinely think there will be humans in 500 years?
[27677.66s -> 27680.70s]  Well, apparently because I can't retire. I have to I have to keep streaming. So
[27682.84s -> 27691.03s]  I hope so there better be
[27691.11s -> 27694.07s]  That was dubski, dude, though. Thank you for that elaborate story
[27695.80s -> 27699.56s]  A flug boy. Thanks for the five bucks. Just dropping to say that I had quite a bit of a scare the other night
[27700.20s -> 27702.20s]  When my account was taken
[27702.44s -> 27703.72s]  But i'm back
[27703.72s -> 27705.72s]  And I have the 1000k
[27706.44s -> 27708.46s]  100k badge
[27708.46s -> 27711.82s]  Here's to one fucking thousand more dollars germa
[27713.40s -> 27714.68s]  Thank you
[27714.68s -> 27716.76s]  Glad you got your account back
[27716.76s -> 27722.36s]  Also, if you were interested at all in destiny 2, it's free september 17th with all year one content
[27724.28s -> 27728.74s]  Pretty good to know
[27729.96s -> 27731.96s]  Thank you flood boy. Glad you got your account back
[27732.68s -> 27737.03s]  I think I played destiny 2 for
[27737.74s -> 27740.78s]  A little while but in my brain destiny 2 and the division 2 are the same game
[27745.08s -> 27747.08s]  I I cannot separate them
[27747.72s -> 27750.44s]  You know like the it's the same image joke. It's that
[27751.24s -> 27755.80s]  I just every time I hear of division 2. It's destiny 2 every time I hear of destiny 2. It's division 2
[27760.63s -> 27762.63s]  I don't know. They're not I know they're not
[27769.90s -> 27773.74s]  They are are they?
[27773.74s -> 27774.78s]  All right

[27779.74s -> 27781.50s]  trying to do
[27781.50s -> 27784.38s]  Um easier streams recently just because of the internet
[27785.10s -> 27788.36s]  I don't really want to set up any like elaborate cool shit to do and oh
[27789.08s -> 27791.08s]  It's turned off by
[27792.20s -> 27794.76s]  So we'll do uh, just a little hangout stream tomorrow
