[6.46s -> 13.40s]  How you doing? I'm here. I'm here. I'm just finishing up something.
[13.40s -> 21.50s]  Come on, don't don't dot dot dot me in a minute after starting the stream. I'm here. Trust me,
[21.50s -> 42.81s]  I'm here. I also had a dream about the stream, by the way, which is very important. I forgot,
[42.81s -> 50.39s]  I don't remember what the context was. I don't remember what it was. Something really embarrassing
[50.39s -> 55.51s]  happened. I don't, I was in, I was on camera and I was sitting here playing a game or something
[55.59s -> 60.76s]  and the first part is gone. But the second part is I remember I was so embarrassed by something,
[60.76s -> 66.65s]  like a really like, like not funny joke or something like that. And I like, I like went,
[67.21s -> 71.61s]  like pretended to think something on stream was funny. Like, oh shit, that joke didn't go well.
[71.61s -> 75.77s]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, or something like that. And I just, I went like, oh my God,
[75.77s -> 82.49s]  what do I do? What do I do? So I like pretended to like fall forward and go like, oh, whoops,
[82.49s -> 88.01s]  I fell. And I was like on camera. You could see like in the monitor, like I was like down,
[89.05s -> 96.25s]  like I wasn't, I was off camera and I was like, oh guys, I fell down down here. Yeah. Oh man,
[96.25s -> 103.46s]  I'm gonna have to turn the stream off. I like fell down and everyone said I was full of shit.
[105.02s -> 112.02s]  Like the chat was like, liar, like full of shit. Get back on cam, liar, liar. And I thought,
[112.02s -> 116.42s]  I thought I did a pretty good job of like selling it. That like, oh, I fell down,
[116.42s -> 122.66s]  but like in my mind, I was like, this didn't, they didn't buy it. So now I did something that
[122.66s -> 127.46s]  people didn't like, but like I told a joke that people thought wasn't funny. So I tried to like
[127.46s -> 134.02s]  run away from the stream by pretending to fall down and like get hurt. And that was a disaster
[134.02s -> 138.78s]  because everyone here was like, no fucking way, liar. So that was a double embarrassment. And I
[138.78s -> 143.05s]  was like, what do I do now? Like, what am I, what am I even supposed to do right now? And then I
[143.05s -> 153.40s]  woke up. Imagine if like, I made a joke that was so bad that I pretended to fall out of the chair.
[154.65s -> 158.41s]  Oh yeah, guys, I fell down out of the chair. Like I'm hurt. I have to leave.
[164.55s -> 173.02s]  Anyways, he's going to do that this stream. No, it's funny because I have fallen out of the chair
[173.02s -> 182.01s]  like two or three years ago. I fell down on stream on the New Year's Eve stream from two years ago.
[183.78s -> 188.02s]  And it's not like, oh, I have to turn the stream off. I was, I was, I was fine.
[197.10s -> 201.58s]  Anyways, I was going to stream yesterday, but I kind of felt like shit. I'm honest.
[203.86s -> 208.26s]  I still kind of have a headache. I had a bad like migraine like headache yesterday.
[209.78s -> 212.42s]  And I didn't want to turn the stream on. And then in an hour, just be like,
[212.42s -> 217.54s]  sorry guys, I got to go. Cause that's happened before. So I figured why not just go today.
[217.54s -> 221.30s]  I feel better. I do feel, I feel better. I don't want to overdo it though.
[221.94s -> 228.22s]  So we'll see how I feel in a few hours. So I'm imagining we'll, we'll, we'll take a look,
[229.18s -> 237.43s]  see how I'm doing in like three to fourish hours right now. So I'll give you the plan.
[237.99s -> 246.71s]  The plan is as follows. Take notes day one today, this week. Well, it's technically the weekend,
[246.71s -> 251.35s]  but you know, whatever this seven day period of, you know, I haven't streamed in two or three days.
[252.23s -> 257.98s]  That's what we start our new period, our new streaming period. Today we're going to do
[257.98s -> 265.75s]  dinosaur fossil hunter for as long as I think it's fun. It looks pretty good. Actually,
[265.75s -> 272.74s]  it actually looks fun. Uh, after that, some point in the next couple of days,
[273.38s -> 280.26s]  we're going to play later alligator kind of a point and click puzzle game. Cute. Looks really
[280.26s -> 286.04s]  cute. It's really fun. Looks really interesting at some point, somewhere in the middle there,
[286.04s -> 292.44s]  or on that stream. I don't know. I'm going to play the house of the dead remake. That game
[292.44s -> 300.73s]  is literally like 40 minutes, so I could probably do that at any point that I feel like it. And then
[301.37s -> 305.61s]  at some point this weekend, we're going to do some horror stuff. More of those little
[305.61s -> 313.56s]  short one to two hour horror games. I got blood wash and murder house. That's going to be this
[313.56s -> 328.84s]  weekend. There's your plan for the week. Excellent. Are you going to finish inscription? I am not
[328.84s -> 334.94s]  going to finish inscription on stream. I've got to, I've got to tell you something. I've done
[334.94s -> 344.89s]  something. I've, I played it off stream already. Yep. I already did. Sorry guys. I did. I did get
[344.89s -> 355.05s]  to the, I got to the third part. I have not continued since then without us. Yeah. Well,
[355.05s -> 361.59s]  some games, some games I would rather do off stream. I already, I talked about this for a little
[361.59s -> 367.91s]  bit, but let's go over it again. A lot of games that require a lot of focus and paying attention
[367.91s -> 371.67s]  and do, don't fuck up this hand because you're going to have to start over.
[372.70s -> 377.82s]  I really don't do well with those games on stream. My brain is just too, I can't, I'm just too
[377.82s -> 383.74s]  scattered talking to chat, looking over here, looking over there, looking over here. And then
[383.74s -> 390.50s]  I'm like, oh shit, there's a guy that I'm playing a game. I have a lot of trouble with that. So I
[390.50s -> 393.86s]  would rather just play those kinds of games off stream. And by the way, I've, it was, it was,
[393.86s -> 400.41s]  it was pretty cool. It was pretty cool. I haven't beat the whole thing, but I got to the third part
[400.97s -> 404.25s]  and at the, okay, I'll be honest though. I got to give you my honest, what happened.
[405.38s -> 412.87s]  I got to the third part of inscription and kind of went, this is fucking cool, but I don't,
[412.87s -> 417.51s]  I don't know if, I don't know. I like, don't want to do it again. Does that, does that make sense?
[418.23s -> 425.85s]  Does anybody, does that make sense? When I say that, when I say like, I don't want to do it again,
[427.59s -> 435.21s]  I don't mean like the game. I mean like, I don't want to like do it again. Right. It's really cool
[435.21s -> 448.50s]  though. And when I say do it again, like, yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to, the games,
[448.50s -> 451.22s]  the game is crazy. I don't want to like spoil anything when anybody hasn't played it,
[451.86s -> 458.34s]  but I'm going to finish it. I'm more, I'm, I'm assumed that's the last or third part of the game.
[459.64s -> 463.24s]  I don't know if there's a fourth or fifth part of the game, but I know that I'm at like a third
[463.24s -> 469.91s]  portion of it. I don't want to do it again. You know what I mean? I don't want to do it again.
[469.91s -> 476.39s]  That's all you need to know. Anyway, so that, okay, that's your plan for the week. Oh, also
[476.39s -> 480.97s]  something important that I want to make sure everyone is aware of this too. So if you ever go
[480.97s -> 487.19s]  to an arcade, there's one real, we were talking in pre-stream about this, by the way, if you don't,
[487.19s -> 493.91s]  if you don't know, if you don't know anything about this stream, I show up to my stream 10
[493.91s -> 500.31s]  to 20 minutes late every single time, but I'm chatting in the pre-stream chat 20 to 30 minutes
[500.31s -> 506.79s]  before the stream starts every time. So I kind of, I kind of fuck myself over in a way because like,
[507.11s -> 512.63s]  I will hang out in chat for like 20 minutes before the stream and then I'll go get ready and I'll
[512.63s -> 517.11s]  those 20 to 30 minutes is how, where the stream starts. Right? So anyways, we were talking about
[517.11s -> 520.87s]  arcades and something that I think is really important for you to understand is that there's
[520.87s -> 525.11s]  only one way for you to understand if you're in a real arcade or not. Forget about like, oh,
[525.11s -> 532.47s]  what do you mean an arcade? No, just listen. If the arcade has the point blank arcade cabinet,
[533.83s -> 538.82s]  rest assured, you're in a real arcade. You can be like, all right, I'm in a real arcade.
[540.10s -> 554.68s]  That is the only way to tell, by the way, if they serve high strength alcohol, that what?
[559.06s -> 565.64s]  That's my, that's my determination, determine if I'm in a real arcade or not. You're gatekeeping
[565.64s -> 570.92s]  arcades. No, I'm just, everybody has their own version of what they consider to be like, all
[570.92s -> 574.68s]  right, I know this is, I'm in a place where I'm going to enjoy myself. This is a real arcade for
[574.68s -> 582.38s]  me. For me, it's point blank. For you, it might also be the X-Men arcade machine with six slots
[582.38s -> 590.73s]  that have the six slots on it. And it's two TVs, two big TVs are connected in the middle to each
[590.73s -> 596.25s]  other. And one of them is way fucking brighter than the other one and has way more contrast
[596.25s -> 606.33s]  and looks wicked fucked up. I know that's probably your indicator, but I have my own indicator.
[606.33s -> 617.13s]  That's my way to tell full story, bro. And don't even tell me, Oh dude, no, if it has an air hockey
[617.13s -> 623.72s]  machine. Oh my God, that's please. An air hockey machine is how an arcade wants you to think
[623.72s -> 627.80s]  they're a real arcade, right? They put that in there like, yeah, dude, we got air hockey here.
[627.80s -> 640.01s]  No, excuse me. That's like the way to make you think that it's a real arcade. What about house
[640.01s -> 642.65s]  of the dead? Oh, that's right. I'm going to play house of the dead as well. Wait, I already said
[642.65s -> 654.68s]  that. Air hockey hater. Okay. Casino Andy. Point blank is a light gun machine from like 20 years
[654.68s -> 663.06s]  ago. It's not a slot machine. I would understand that argument. If I just told you, dude, you know
[663.06s -> 669.46s]  what I really love in the arcades? Just throwing dice in the air and hoping that I get a money
[669.46s -> 679.00s]  after I do it. Huh? I said a point blank. It's a light gun game. If there's a bowling alley there,
[679.00s -> 685.40s]  you know what bowling up a bowling alley? I think is Adam. Not a fan of that. We could spend a lot
[685.40s -> 688.28s]  of time doing this. I don't want to spend that much time doing this, but bowling alley being
[688.28s -> 700.66s]  in your arcade. That's just less room for arcade machines. In my opinion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[700.66s -> 707.45s]  That's just how I personally feel. If you've got a, if you've got like 20 lanes of bowling
[708.09s -> 715.05s]  and it's like two thirds of your entire floor and the rest is an arcade. Oh man. You could have had,
[715.05s -> 729.11s]  you could have had point blank one, two and three 20. I don't know. What about a roller rink? What
[729.11s -> 735.59s]  about a go-kart track? Remember you're gaslighting a lot of people. I'm not, I'm just telling you my
[735.59s -> 744.26s]  opinions. Okay. I didn't say you have to believe this too. I just said, I think I personally,
[744.26s -> 755.67s]  what I believe. What about a wrestling ring? That would be ridiculous. By the way, this is this,
[755.67s -> 761.53s]  this is the music I've been listening to this whole time. I think that's why I'm so ready to
[761.53s -> 774.86s]  tell you this. This has been blasting in both of my ears. What about laser tag? Look laser tag is
[774.86s -> 779.82s]  fine. Bowling alleys are fine. But if I go to the website and I look at the pictures of your
[779.82s -> 786.63s]  floor that you have and you do this, a bunch of like real estate angles to try to make the bathroom
[786.63s -> 791.19s]  look bigger than it looks, right? Like, oh, here's our arcade section. And it's like, whoa, look at
[791.19s -> 800.94s]  how big that looks. But there's like fucking eight machines there. No, like, okay. If you have enough
[800.94s -> 805.82s]  cabinets where it's like, all right, you've got enough arcade machines. Sure. Throw a bowling
[805.82s -> 810.98s]  alley in there if you want to. But if you call yourself an arcade and you got like fucking eight
[810.98s -> 822.55s]  arcade cabinets, I think that has to be a threshold. I'm sorry. This is the weirdest rant. It's not.
[823.35s -> 830.81s]  This is the German on eight five fucking whatever podcasts, but we just kind of talk about whatever
[834.57s -> 842.38s]  and it like zooms in on like the iTunes store that zooms in on like, like 40 reviews.
[842.38s -> 848.76s]  And, and I've got like two and a half stars and the podcast is like a hundred bucks,
[849.40s -> 866.02s]  but whatever podcast and the first like the most highly rated review or whatever is just like,
[866.66s -> 870.94s]  this guy didn't even talk about anything important. He got to the section where he was talking about
[870.94s -> 875.18s]  like how many arcade cabinets you have to have to be like the threshold to be allowed to be an arcade.
[876.06s -> 886.90s]  And I stopped listening and I requested a refund. Anyways, put the face cam on. All you face cam
[886.90s -> 903.72s]  Andes. I didn't even tweet this. Did I? Did I tweet this? I thought I did. I guess not. Okay.
[903.72s -> 914.62s]  Well, there you go. Tweet. Tweet done. I got to use my Twitter more. It's so bad. It really is.
[921.08s -> 924.52s]  I need to do more tweets rather than I'm live.
[929.72s -> 935.56s]  But like, I don't want to, okay. I have a huge draft of tweets. I just write tweets and I don't
[935.56s -> 942.60s]  do, I just think that people are going to think I'm an idiot. This is, I'm going to read you every
[942.60s -> 953.19s]  few months we do this. I'm going to read you my drafts. Okay. No, no, no. Stop it. What, what you
[953.19s -> 960.71s]  doing my Wellington? No. What? Stop it. Stop. You donkey. What you doing? No. What you, my Wellington.
[960.71s -> 967.40s]  That's the last thing I wrote down. And then I don't know what this one is. This one says
[967.40s -> 973.93s]  wrestling referees are video game AI. I think you can probably break that one down.
[976.94s -> 981.10s]  Um, and then the next one is, I guess, I guess this one lost arc came out.
[981.98s -> 987.26s]  The only arc I care about is Noah's arc. Get out of my mentions and into a Bible.
[988.73s -> 999.37s]  I don't know what that one was about. Sometimes I just read, I don't know. Sometimes I just write
[999.37s -> 1009.59s]  these down, but then like I only publish like going live at 6 PM. If it makes you feel better,
[1009.59s -> 1021.29s]  everyone already thinks you're an idiot. Read that now. That lost arc came out like five months
[1021.29s -> 1032.58s]  ago. It's not going to be relevant at all. Maybe when there's DLC, I'll do it. Who cares?
[1033.54s -> 1039.54s]  The game came. I'm not. Okay. That would be like making it. It's so irrelevant. I can't.
[1040.10s -> 1051.21s]  It's too irrelevant. Next game. I haven't even started playing. By the way, I, for a second,
[1051.21s -> 1055.29s]  I thought this was like a roast beef. I forgot what game this was. I was like, oh,
[1055.29s -> 1061.94s]  this guy's got like a whole pot roast here. All right. Stop it. Let's go. You guys ready?
[1064.12s -> 1066.68s]  I'll turn, I'm going to turn it off if you're good. Only if you guys are good.
[1067.32s -> 1083.00s]  Okay. So this is a game where you go. I was going to say you hunt dinosaurs,
[1083.00s -> 1090.10s]  but that's not what you do. Here with games presents dinosaur fossil hunter. Okay.
[1091.22s -> 1098.14s]  It's fully voice acted. By the way, the wind is fucking crazy right now. Can you hear that?
[1098.14s -> 1108.10s]  Wild right now. It's crazy here right now. All right. I already did some of these controls, but
[1108.10s -> 1114.41s]  here it's fucked up. It actually sounds like, it actually sounds like I'm going to like get blown
[1114.41s -> 1120.55s]  over. Oh, happy mother's day to all the mothers out there. Oh, by the way, call your mother,
[1120.55s -> 1128.68s]  please call your mother. Is that good? I got to put both headphones in. I might want to turn it
[1128.68s -> 1135.53s]  up. Art Andy and that guy permanently. I never want to see his fucking name ever again for a
[1135.53s -> 1150.49s]  minute. Okay. Let's go. All right. So this is my, is this my museum? Okay. Controls, tip panels,
[1150.49s -> 1158.38s]  prestige roadmap. What is the prestige road? I can't even open it. Okay. Left and right. Okay.
[1158.38s -> 1166.73s]  Your museum sucks. No, it doesn't actually. Is it T-Rex? I thought the T-Rex was way bigger than
[1166.73s -> 1186.62s]  this. And this here is like 50 feet tall. Cool. It's 50 feet tall. Okay. So I think this is where
[1186.62s -> 1195.26s]  I gotta go. Museum workshop. Okay. I think this is probably a tutorial. Platinum patron of science,
[1195.26s -> 1205.08s]  Kendra. Gold patron of science, Jack Renshaw. This is, all right. We're slowly running out
[1205.08s -> 1215.99s]  of space in the museum. Oh, I thought I had to do this. I'd love to draw dinosaurs. I was like,
[1215.99s -> 1223.67s]  this is not the game I thought it was going to be. Oh, I do have to do this. All right. Let's go for
[1223.67s -> 1259.21s]  it. Give me the pencil. Oh shit. Honestly, I'm telling you right now, this is, this is, this is,
[1259.21s -> 1267.22s]  this kid's ready for upper management. It's just like, oh yeah. It's just like these, these little
[1267.22s -> 1286.78s]  dot to dot puzzles just to bore, bore your child. Okay. Is that good? I got it. Is that it? Oh,
[1286.78s -> 1297.70s]  that's it. Okay. Next drawing. You missed the front leg. I just was, I was just coloring it in. Okay.
[1297.70s -> 1314.41s]  Next drawing. New draw. Oh no, I have to, I'm doing it. I have to do it again. E? Okay. Oh wait. I
[1314.41s -> 1366.18s]  can, oh, next one. All right. So let me do it right. Let me actually do it right. Why do I feel
[1366.18s -> 1376.04s]  like kids in school, like probably do this stuff? You know, like sometimes you just look over and
[1376.04s -> 1382.58s]  you see like, Hey, come sub to my Twitch. Like, Hey, you can find me over here at Twitch. I feel
[1382.58s -> 1396.54s]  like, I feel like kids probably do this. Oh, like they're like Twitter. What kid has a Twitter?
[1396.54s -> 1406.06s]  Do kids have Twitter? They shouldn't. They shouldn't. Do they? No, they don't. Do they?
[1406.95s -> 1413.75s]  Kids don't, kids don't have Twitter. I hope they don't. I missed these dots. So I'll get it.
[1413.75s -> 1443.72s]  All right. Continue. What the fuck am I doing out here? Oh, there's a sprint. Wait, I'm supposed to
[1443.72s -> 1461.40s]  be eight years old right now. Where, where's the, where's my supervision? Okay. Right. Left mouse
[1461.40s -> 1470.86s]  button. Pick up and inspect. Right is drop or hold to throw. All right. I found my first fossil here.
[1470.86s -> 1482.15s]  What are all the car sounds? Okay. I'm just in my backyard, right? And I'm in, I'm just like,
[1482.15s -> 1496.33s]  it's imagination time. I'm imagining all of this. Okay. Holy shit. That's why we're like
[1496.33s -> 1506.68s]  $50,000. Okay. So this is, I can rotate it. I can rotate it. Oh, no, I can't. I lost it half a year
[1506.68s -> 1513.16s]  later. I mean lost it. At the age of 14, nearly all I could think about was putting together and painting
[1513.16s -> 1520.25s]  dinosaur models. I was getting better at it. All right. That kid, this kid got into the wood stain
[1520.25s -> 1525.50s]  and did this. Like, I, excuse me. Like, where'd you get the stain to do that? This one comes with
[1525.50s -> 1532.33s]  the manual. It's dead simple. It comes with the manual. All right. Hold on. Let me do a little bit of,
[1532.33s -> 1553.48s]  let me do a little grease action here. 14. All right. So here we go. So I get to do this.
[1554.28s -> 1562.47s]  Oh, this is cool. Rotate, pick up part, drop part. Okay. So I just have to go this way. All right.
[1562.47s -> 1573.93s]  So here we go. I got like a, this is easy. No, pick it up. That's a great sound effect by the way.
[1573.93s -> 1603.05s]  Why is my nose so itchy? Ooh. All right. So I got a brontosaurus. This one's tough. Oh, fuck. Okay.
[1603.05s -> 1611.24s]  Can I like spin this around? All right. Well, very obviously this is here. What if I don't have the
[1611.24s -> 1636.58s]  drawing? Yeah. Easy. Easy. Do I get to paint it too? Why does this 10 year old have a voice like this?
[1636.58s -> 1649.00s]  He's remembering. He's reminiscing. Okay. Well, this is definitely where the head goes.
[1654.34s -> 1659.64s]  Oh, that I can rotate it. All right. So this is where the head goes. These are the arms,
[1659.64s -> 1680.76s]  the tail. All right. This is the big part of the tail. Yep. No, that didn't work. Let me
[1680.76s -> 1696.25s]  just do all the stuff. I know where it goes first. Hey, this is a leg. That's like, there's like a
[1696.25s -> 1713.90s]  thigh wrong way. I know these are, this is tough. I don't know. Like this. Yep. Okay. Keep going.
[1715.10s -> 1735.00s]  It's like a life is strange soundtrack. Is that right? Yeah, I got it. I'm good. Maybe I could
[1735.00s -> 1742.97s]  use more practice and build one of them again. That's difficulty level. I don't need to do that.
[1742.97s -> 1750.25s]  I know what I'm doing. A couple of years later, the money I had received as a reward in that
[1750.25s -> 1759.48s]  competition turned out to be of an invaluable help. I mean, I got some money. Adventure of a
[1759.48s -> 1767.29s]  lifetime in your twenties. I think it's possible. I was exactly 20 years old when I found an article
[1767.29s -> 1772.33s]  about a paleontological group in a newspaper. It turned out they needed volunteers who were
[1772.33s -> 1776.65s]  willing to work in the north of the country. It was a long shot, but I didn't want to miss
[1776.65s -> 1781.05s]  such a great opportunity. Oh, for some reason, I thought dinosaurs like existed in this world.
[1783.56s -> 1788.60s]  See like the front page, like front page of the news, man, like the T-Rex is back.
[1788.60s -> 1798.14s]  Stay in your house. What would, what would people do if there was a front page on like number one
[1798.14s -> 1805.91s]  on Reddit, like top of Reddit, top of every news website, CNN, Fox news, ABC. If it was like T-Rex
[1805.91s -> 1814.55s]  is a back, what would happen? And it was like a big roaring T-Rex. Like that's like the pictures
[1814.55s -> 1825.45s]  of it on Reddit. I don't know. Okay. Gameplay basics. What would, would you like leave your
[1825.45s -> 1833.83s]  house? Like front, the top front page of Reddit, over 50 T-Rexes have been spotted in various
[1833.83s -> 1839.72s]  cities across America. Are you going to leave? Are you going to like leave? What do you do?
[1840.52s -> 1848.60s]  I think I'd be scared. Okay. Gameplay tips, important interactive objects. Let's just go
[1848.60s -> 1855.38s]  over this real quick. You know, it's a video. I'm going to give the dev plus one full letter grade.
[1855.38s -> 1863.83s]  You just show me, show me what, show me. Don't tell me, show me. Yep. Gameplay tips up a right
[1863.83s -> 1871.27s]  corner. Read them on the tablet. Okay. F1. Got it. Look at this. Absolutely perfect tutorial.
[1871.27s -> 1880.22s]  What about this one? Important object display description in the lower left corner. Okay.
[1880.22s -> 1883.10s]  Look at this. I honestly, like, I'm not kidding. This is like a perfect tutorial.
[1886.28s -> 1889.32s]  Okay. Third hint will be in the color of the pointer. Okay. So yeah, just like this
[1889.32s -> 1895.61s]  information on the bottom. Easy. Icons on the compass hide with growing distance.
[1895.61s -> 1900.86s]  Okay. Just like that on the map on your tablet, you can select an object or place that where you
[1900.86s -> 1908.73s]  want to go. All right. This would have taken a AAA game, like three hours to tell me this stuff.
[1908.73s -> 1912.73s]  Okay. Then when you unlock new locations, use the travel tab on your tablet to move to another
[1912.73s -> 1921.45s]  location. Good. Okay. So it's like right there. I'm a day in the trip. You can select the time
[1921.45s -> 1925.13s]  of day car. You want to make your cars are in this game. You just got two full letter
[1925.13s -> 1931.56s]  grades in one minute. If all of you said this game was like a C, it just became an A minus
[1931.56s -> 1942.63s]  just because of the last 15 seconds. Okay. So cool. Let's go. So I can drive, I drive around.
[1942.63s -> 1950.01s]  I got my tablet. Welcome to the mining area. A few weeks ago, miners came across something that
[1950.01s -> 1954.41s]  appears to be dinosaur remains. We managed to get the mine closed until the matter is dealt with
[1954.97s -> 1958.33s]  as neither the workers nor the board of directors is happy about the lockdown.
[1958.97s -> 1965.02s]  Okay. We got to act fast. Your job is relatively easy. Head to the area marked on your map and
[1965.02s -> 1969.10s]  leave no stone unturned. The area is marked on your radar as well, so you shouldn't have any
[1969.10s -> 1973.34s]  problems finding it. The off-road car parked nearby is fueled and ready. We hope your work
[1973.34s -> 1978.14s]  will be fruitful. With your help, we should be able to finally complete the full skeleton
[1979.10s -> 1982.06s]  for our new museum. That's a fun one to say when you do like the radio voice
[1982.70s -> 1988.86s]  of the missing bones that we're looking for our hip bone, right arm bone, and a vertebra.
[1988.86s -> 1993.88s]  All right, let's go. Let's go. Turn it up a little bit. It's not that loud.
[1997.30s -> 2001.46s]  Okay. So we've got two tools. This is my flashlight. I've got a drone.
[2002.34s -> 2027.24s]  Does this have gas? How do I get out of here? Okay, let's go. So I need to go where on the map?
[2027.88s -> 2039.16s]  Two by four, four by four. Why do I have like a bunch of moving stuff? All right. Use the horn.
[2039.88s -> 2050.07s]  Nice. This is the music. Okay. So where am I going? Where's the map? Okay. I got to go
[2050.07s -> 2061.70s]  over there on the right. All right. So turn around. They have like a street. All right.
[2061.70s -> 2072.34s]  You can go kind of fast. Uh-oh. It's like, wait, don't go so fast. Hold on. Removing obstacles.
[2072.34s -> 2078.78s]  Remove lying tree trunks with a chainsaw and use sledgehammer to break rocks. Note the color
[2078.78s -> 2082.94s]  of the interactive cursor when using tools. When it is green, you can work. Ooh, can I find stuff
[2082.94s -> 2089.19s]  in there? If you find stuff in a place you can't get out of, use R to reset your character. I think
[2089.19s -> 2095.56s]  I'm about to be in that part. There's an excavation equipment in your car. After using it to secure
[2095.56s -> 2100.73s]  the excavation area, you'll need to get another set of equipment from the hub. Don't forget about
[2100.73s -> 2104.97s]  this when you go on your next fossil site search. In hard to reach and muddy terrain, use the four
[2104.97s -> 2115.27s]  by four drive. You can reset the car by pressing R2. All right. Just hit like it is dead.
[2118.84s -> 2127.78s]  Like I'm dead. Like I'm, it's over. That's it. All right. I got to do this, right?
[2128.42s -> 2141.24s]  Like I missed the sledgehammer. Cool. All right. So how do I get this? How do I get this out of the
[2141.24s -> 2151.11s]  way? Just going to pick it up. I have to keep cutting it. How many, how many pieces do I need?
[2151.75s -> 2177.16s]  Can I just drive over it? How do I pick it up? Oh, there we go. Nobody else works here, right?
[2177.16s -> 2192.39s]  That's why I shouted the windshield. I don't do that with any bones. That would be bad, right?
[2192.39s -> 2200.86s]  This, I love this music. It's so like epic. Okay. So I got to go that way. There's the dig site.
[2201.50s -> 2232.10s]  I put it in four by four. Yeah. Four wheel drive. All right. I can't go that way. Maybe I can. You
[2232.10s -> 2235.54s]  see, they never show this in the car commercials because this is what happens if you were to do
[2235.54s -> 2267.61s]  this. That didn't do anything. Okay. There we go. Four wheel drive. Get through the mud.
[2267.61s -> 2275.30s]  I don't want to push the car. I'm fine. All right. Back into two wheel drive.
[2275.86s -> 2288.42s]  Let's go. Use a hammer. All right. Our need to have all wheels grounded to get. Oh, I thought
[2288.42s -> 2303.83s]  the other wheels were all gone. This is a big cheese. It kind of is like a big piece of cheese,
[2303.83s -> 2310.95s]  isn't it? How strong is this guy? Oh no fucking way. Hercules couldn't even do that in the movie.
[2315.59s -> 2324.15s]  That would be so funny if there was sound effects. It was like, I definitely cannot pick this one up.
[2324.15s -> 2341.18s]  You big? Make your own sounds. I can, okay. I don't, I can get out of this. Is there any
[2341.18s -> 2356.57s]  valuables here too? Like with it, can I like sift for gold? Okay. Here we go. We're here.
[2356.57s -> 2373.21s]  Now I got to get out and I've got to do some excavation. Oh, it's this way. Okay. Is it near
[2373.21s -> 2384.87s]  the tree? All right. It's somewhere over here. Bring your car. Oh, this is just like Minecraft.
[2385.82s -> 2394.47s]  Not really. This is dinosaur poop simulator. I don't think you did. The dinosaur poo didn't
[2394.47s -> 2417.59s]  fossilize. Wasn't it absorbed into the fucking ground? Did it? Okay. Here we go. So what? Oh,
[2417.59s -> 2440.12s]  I have to fuck that. Secure the area. Oh, it's just doing it. This is funny. Where's he going?
[2440.12s -> 2448.46s]  Oh, just, should I skip it? Dude, I'm sorry. This game blows. You know, it's, I can tell you,
[2448.46s -> 2455.66s]  I can tell you about these like, these are like five minute Andes. Okay. It's so it's been like
[2456.62s -> 2472.44s]  15 minutes. You should play a different. No, stop. Oh, wait. How big is this area? Oh, okay.
[2472.44s -> 2489.59s]  Play checkers. No checkers sucks. Okay. Here we go. It does check. Okay. Checkers. Look,
[2489.59s -> 2496.50s]  I don't like chess either. I'm going to, it's not like, I think I look checkers is not a bad game,
[2496.50s -> 2505.86s]  but checkers chess, any game where I have to sit down like across somebody and move little pieces
[2505.94s -> 2510.90s]  on like a game board and go against somebody else. I don't care. I'm, it bores the absolute
[2510.90s -> 2515.14s]  fuck out of me. I would rather like just go like roll down a hill. You know what I mean?
[2516.01s -> 2522.04s]  I don't want to look, I don't want to play chess. I want to like roll down the hill.
[2522.04s -> 2526.68s]  I don't like want to play chess. I, but Hey, let's play chess, dude. Oh, just like,
[2526.68s -> 2530.87s]  please. Like I want to do anything else. Anything but chess, anything, but checkers or chess.
[2530.87s -> 2534.95s]  I don't know. There's some like really like high brain people that they get a lot of enjoyment
[2534.95s -> 2539.61s]  from that shit. You're really analytical and you like problem solving and stuff. And that's
[2539.61s -> 2543.21s]  awesome. That's really cool. I'm glad you have the capability to do that. I just want to roll
[2543.21s -> 2554.46s]  down a hill. I don't, I've always tried. My brother was into chess and he really wanted somebody to
[2554.46s -> 2560.47s]  play with and he would just checkmate me every fucking 10 seconds. Like he was just trying to
[2560.47s -> 2565.58s]  find someone to play with and he'd be like, Hey man, let's, you want to play chess? I was like,
[2567.50s -> 2572.92s]  yeah. And I would just sit there and I would just, I only, the only thing I knew what to do in chess
[2572.92s -> 2578.02s]  was move the pawns. I didn't know how to do anything else. So he would just, I would move
[2578.02s -> 2585.03s]  my pawns up sometimes two spaces, sometimes one for no reason. And they would like and checkmate
[2585.03s -> 2592.28s]  me in like five minutes. This happened to every time. I've got to feel bad looking back because
[2593.58s -> 2598.60s]  he really did just really want to play and like the internet didn't exist. Right. So you couldn't
[2598.68s -> 2603.88s]  just like, Oh, go play chess against like a computer. You can just right now you losing
[2603.88s -> 2613.69s]  viewers. Good. Right now you can open up any app, any website. You can literally go play chess right
[2613.69s -> 2619.72s]  now in literally on five seconds from right now. I kind of feel bad for the people that really
[2619.72s -> 2628.58s]  wanted to do that kind of stuff, but they just have no, you didn't have any access to it.
[2628.58s -> 2635.14s]  All right. There's your story. In the excavation area, use the GPR to find the stones hidden
[2635.14s -> 2644.79s]  underground. Ooh. Okay. Dig in the soil and sand with a shovel. Pay attention to the color of the
[2644.79s -> 2650.49s]  cursor that indicates where you can use the tool. All right. So you got to find the rock, dig,
[2652.90s -> 2656.50s]  use the pickaxe to search the rocky ground. Pay attention to the color of the cursor that indicates
[2656.50s -> 2662.86s]  where you can use the tool. Sick. Visual inspection at this stage will help you identify stones of
[2662.86s -> 2673.16s]  other geologic periods. You can remove them quickly. Let's go. I love stories, people happy.
[2675.32s -> 2686.79s]  Losing viewers equals spinning out the week. Did you hear that noise? That was like, oh,
[2686.79s -> 2698.09s]  okay. Grab a palette. What do I do with this? Oh, there's no fossils in here. Okay. I get it.
[2698.65s -> 2710.82s]  All right. Here we go. Now we got to open up the machine. That is this thing here. All right. Find
[2710.82s -> 2718.78s]  a good place for exploration and scan it. All right. Scanning. Is it on the map? No, just somewhere
[2718.78s -> 2734.01s]  here. Scanning. This is a bunch of bullshit. What's going to happen is that somebody told
[2734.01s -> 2740.07s]  me to come out here and do this. There's nothing. There's not going to be anything here. This is
[2740.07s -> 2746.58s]  like this way. Somebody wanted to get rid of me for a few hours. All of a sudden, like all
[2746.58s -> 2753.53s]  the sprinkler system is going to turn on and just get me like soaking wet. And I'm going to be like,
[2754.66s -> 2764.74s]  fucking pieces of shit. This is not right. Yeah, Dave, go there and go look for dinosaur bones.
[2766.33s -> 2778.26s]  Where? There's nothing here. How do I scan? I just go out here. There's nothing in this place.
[2786.78s -> 2799.00s]  Place, place flag. Where is this place? Go to the dirt mound. Oh my God. What? There everything's
[2799.00s -> 2808.10s]  this whole thing is a dirt mound. Oh, you mean this, you mean the fresh dirt. All right. Whatever.
[2808.10s -> 2841.19s]  That looks pretty good. Oh, all right. Mark these two spots. Mark it here. Right here. Okay.
[2841.19s -> 2861.22s]  There's a lot of fossils here. What about there? No. What's your guys favorite dinosaur? Mine's
[2861.22s -> 2879.43s]  the chicken. Look it up. All right. I think I got enough. So now I got to dig at these spots.
[2879.43s -> 2909.70s]  How far down do I go? Oh, I got it. Oh shit. I can't move. I'm going to get rid of this crap.
[2909.70s -> 2918.70s]  All right. I, okay. Be careful. I get, I got to dig that out. How do I, is it, can I get it?
[2918.70s -> 2939.83s]  Can I just pull it out? Put the chainsaw away. How do I get this out? Dude, there's probably like
[2939.83s -> 2957.75s]  10 dinosaur bones in here. Okay. I get it. I pick it up. Find first. Inspect the stone.
[2957.83s -> 2971.37s]  How do I inspect it? Dude, stop digging. Hold on. How do I inspect this?
[2971.37s -> 2977.10s]  Inspect the stone. How do I do that? Pick up, use, inspect. Right? That's what I'm trying to do.
[2977.10s -> 2993.51s]  I need to do more pickaxe. Oh shit. All right. Here we go. Fossils emit small amounts of radiation.
[2997.10s -> 3000.81s]  That was a bad one. That wasn't, that was not a funny one. No, I didn't. I'll do it again. I'll
[3000.81s -> 3008.06s]  do it better. That one was not as good either. I'll try it one more time. Oh, this, wait,
[3008.06s -> 3012.78s]  radiation? That was a good one. Use that one instead. That one, that was actually a pretty
[3012.78s -> 3017.02s]  good one. The first two were fucking cringe and awful. All right. This allows us to use the
[3017.02s -> 3022.33s]  Geiger counter to search for them. It will be indicated. All right. Cool. None of those.
[3022.33s -> 3030.04s]  That third one was fine. Use a towel to remove mud from the stone. Okay. And then we can identify
[3030.04s -> 3044.10s]  the species. This is cool. This is cool. All right. Let's go. I said bunker ass the first time.
[3044.10s -> 3058.31s]  Cringe. There's no bones in this rock? Oh, I can't get out of here. Hold on. What do you mean
[3058.31s -> 3067.02s]  there's no bones in this rock? Oh, there are fossils in that little one. You need boneless
[3067.02s -> 3079.24s]  rocks. You don't want to have, you want boneless buffalo rocks? That's so stupid. I love it.
[3079.24s -> 3086.14s]  Okay. Prepare for transport. Use plaster to protect fragile fossils. This is so much, this is,
[3086.78s -> 3096.94s]  this is cool. You have to pack it into a, place the plaster stone in a shipping crate.
[3096.94s -> 3105.61s]  Okay. And then you put it into a crate. You're going to bring the necessary amount of crates
[3105.61s -> 3110.66s]  and then place the boxes with the fossils in your car and transport them to the hub.
[3112.79s -> 3118.81s]  Transport. That small chest can be transported by passenger cars. For large, you need a truck. Okay.
[3118.81s -> 3140.90s]  Park your vehicle. Okay. I got it. Big money. I can't move though. I can't get, I'm stuck. I
[3140.90s -> 3167.88s]  can't move. It's R, right? I can't get unstuck. R. Get me the fuck out of here. All right. I'm
[3167.88s -> 3175.91s]  good. But I want, I need to check the other ones too. Why did I not bring a stepladder?
[3185.38s -> 3190.26s]  Okay. I got to make a path. What'd I put with that? Let me, let me do the thing with this,
[3190.82s -> 3202.12s]  this one right here, right? All right. This is it. So let's look at it. Okay. Yep. There's bones in
[3202.12s -> 3221.74s]  there. Plaster it up. Make sure we keep it safe. Okay. I got a message. Evacuation. Oh, nevermind.
[3223.16s -> 3232.12s]  Yeah. The, been secured. Yep. Transport it. Okay. Yep. Okay. And now I got to put this in a box
[3232.12s -> 3246.22s]  over here. Why are you putting a cast on it? Okay. Yes. Okay. Unknown species, unknown bone.
[3246.22s -> 3256.94s]  How many can I fit in here? Oh my God. That, what the hell was that sound? Let's get this shit out
[3256.94s -> 3278.17s]  of me. Okay. Wait, there's more of stones. I can fit one more in there. All right. This is fun. I
[3278.17s -> 3287.62s]  want to do this more. In my, uh, this thing. Can I eventually get a bigger car? Where are all my
[3287.62s -> 3311.64s]  markers? Oh, did you just hit that Yonki Splonky? You got it, man. All right. Let me clear this out
[3311.64s -> 3320.33s]  because I don't want to get stuck like I just did. Dude, we missed you. I haven't gone anywhere
[3320.33s -> 3328.01s]  because I haven't hit the Yonki Splonky in like seven months. You know, there's other dances
[3328.01s -> 3331.37s]  besides the Yonki Splonky, right? You know that there's other things to, there's other movements
[3331.37s -> 3341.40s]  you can do with your body. You know that, right? Is that a fossil? I don't know. Okay. There was
[3341.40s -> 3355.54s]  another one here. Where is it? Let me check these. Does this have any fossils in it? That's passive
[3355.54s -> 3366.25s]  aggressive Andy right there. Oh, that's fine. Oh, you said it's fine. Oh, you said it's fine.
[3366.25s -> 3381.45s]  That's fine. That's okay. Sure. Oh, that's fine. Whatever you say. No dinosaur bones in there.
[3381.53s -> 3403.45s]  Oh, whatever. All right. Let me, there's other ones here and this one, the guy flies an avatar.
[3403.45s -> 3427.80s]  All right. Let's identify these. Take that up. There's gotta be one in here, right? That out of
[3427.80s -> 3441.43s]  here. Excuse me. This out of here. I don't want to confuse you with another one. He's gone. They
[3441.43s -> 3465.67s]  look at the CCTV footage. Why did he do that? Why would he do that? What was he doing? All right.
[3465.67s -> 3475.70s]  Let's take a look. Nope. Nope. Three in a row. What about this one?
[3477.27s -> 3493.86s]  In go. All right. Get this out of here. Break this one up. Good. Get rid of it. See you later.
[3493.86s -> 3505.29s]  All right. So what's in here? We got two stones now. All right. I have to be honest with you.
[3505.29s -> 3510.20s]  Turn off the music. Not yet. Not until I'm sick of it. The first like 20 minutes of this game,
[3510.20s -> 3516.36s]  I thought we're going to be just like, like a piece of shit. Um, I am over the last like 30
[3516.36s -> 3520.66s]  minutes have slowly been going. This is actually going to be probably pretty cool. This is actually
[3520.66s -> 3525.59s]  going to be kind of fun. Like I was like, this could be, I don't know if I'm going to like this.
[3525.59s -> 3530.04s]  I think I'm actually going to really like this, especially when you start like painting the
[3530.04s -> 3552.82s]  dinosaur bones and stuff. This looks like cornbread and I wait, I can do three. I can put one on top
[3552.82s -> 3561.40s]  too. All right. I'm going to get another one. One can go up top. All right. Let's keep this one area
[3561.40s -> 3584.70s]  here. Oh, we got it. Please turn the music off. I'll just wait. You know, this is making me like
[3584.70s -> 3589.88s]  into it for a minute. I'll get bored of it in like 15 more minutes. Trust me. Don't worry.
[3589.88s -> 3607.78s]  Can I get rid of this? There's some shit right here. This one, what does it even down here?
[3611.24s -> 3623.45s]  This one here. All right. Let's see. Any of these have anything in it? Get that out of here.
[3627.93s -> 3636.76s]  Nothing? What the fuck are you talking about? Oh, there's nothing here at all. I did this.
[3636.76s -> 3652.94s]  Okay. I'm an idiot. Where's the, over there. There's nothing there. How come you like boring
[3652.94s -> 3666.50s]  games? Not everything has to have like machine gunfire. Okay. Not every game needs to have
[3666.50s -> 3678.98s]  machine gunfire. Okay. Every video game does not have to have, it doesn't have to have it
[3678.98s -> 3702.95s]  be an enjoyable experience. Plus I'm a boring fucking person. So there is your answer. Dude,
[3702.95s -> 3707.99s]  those are the, uh, dude. Oh wow. Like I wonder what his life is like when he's not streaming.
[3708.71s -> 3717.50s]  I am a boring fucking guy. Okay. Um, I think it was last night. I fell asleep. I had my iPad
[3717.50s -> 3721.26s]  and I fell asleep too. This is like kind of crazy. This is why I had like a nightmare.
[3722.28s -> 3726.20s]  I was watching a showcase, like a Halloween convention showcase where they show all like the
[3726.20s -> 3732.20s]  animatronics and shit. And I fell asleep to it and it autoplayed like five years of their convention.
[3736.09s -> 3741.21s]  Like if you scroll through these videos, it's like, oh, that was the biggest Halloween
[3741.21s -> 3746.41s]  convention or something. And it's like a huge thing. And they showcase all the new
[3746.41s -> 3757.66s]  animatronics and Halloween scary stuff. Right. And I just sitting there, dude, like this, just like,
[3757.66s -> 3763.21s]  I'm not doing anything else. Right. But if you scroll through, it was like five straight years
[3763.21s -> 3770.55s]  of their convention and people going to it, like hours of videos. And I shit you not almost every
[3770.55s -> 3781.91s]  10 to 15 seconds. You hear. It's like this, this like fucking face peeled off zombie going like this.
[3786.28s -> 3794.52s]  It was literally the whole video. And I was, I felt I slept to that.
[3798.44s -> 3813.21s]  Was anything in here? They all do that too. When do you, okay. The, I, all those like crazy
[3813.21s -> 3821.13s]  animatronics, they all do that like really strange like movements. It's just so unsettling. It's so
[3821.13s -> 3830.57s]  scary. And I make this reference to you too. Animatronics, like the Halloween ones where it's
[3830.57s -> 3835.13s]  like the ghoul that like moves and just kind of goes at you. It reminds me of like Dark Souls
[3835.13s -> 3842.12s]  enemies. They're just these mindless, brainless things that just, I'm getting you now. Like here
[3842.12s -> 3848.02s]  I come. That's why Dark Souls is so scary. We talked about that when I was playing Elden Ring,
[3848.02s -> 3856.14s]  but all the From Software AI, it's just, I'm killing you. I'm killing you. I don't care about
[3856.14s -> 3860.70s]  anything else. I don't give a shit about anything else. I, my programming is just get that fucking
[3860.70s -> 3866.84s]  guy right now. It doesn't, there is no like, oh, he's running back off a little. Nope. It's just
[3869.62s -> 3875.91s]  until I get you. It's horrifying. It's like a nightmare. It's a dream. That's why those
[3875.91s -> 3883.22s]  things are so scary. They just don't stop. That's why Michael Myers was scary. Michael Myers didn't
[3883.22s -> 3889.22s]  do anything. Like I could probably sprint, punch Michael Myers in the face and knock him out and
[3889.22s -> 3894.02s]  he'd be dead. You know what I mean? Like I could probably like full sprint, fucking smash him in
[3894.02s -> 3901.78s]  the head. Like right here. He'd just be like, but it would take one punch and it's right here.
[3901.78s -> 3904.50s]  And he would, his head would explode. I'm telling you his head would explode,
[3905.22s -> 3912.86s]  but no, because he's just like, just walks forward and has no emotion. He just has like an AI that's
[3912.86s -> 3917.75s]  like, go get that person. Just walk at them. That's why it was just, holy shit. What the
[3917.75s -> 3929.93s]  fuck is this terrifying thing in this one? All right. Where was I digging? I completely forgot.
[3929.93s -> 3934.25s]  We started talking about Halloween stuff, but yeah, I was sleeping to that. It is every 15 seconds.
[3934.25s -> 3940.49s]  You just hear screaming. No wonder I had a fucking nightmare. I could have turned auto play off, man.
[3940.49s -> 3952.12s]  It's seriously, but I always just forget to cause I'm logged in. How many pieces of furniture do you
[3952.12s -> 3962.46s]  have? I don't know. Like I have a chair, two chairs, I think table. I don't know. I got five
[3962.46s -> 3980.47s]  pieces of furniture, maybe. Fuck. I said, this is going to be a chill stream. I say that every time
[3980.47s -> 3985.67s]  and then I've, I don't know. I'm like fucked up. I'm going to give myself another headache.
[3985.67s -> 3996.06s]  Like I had yesterday. All right. Let's get this sealed up. You need to inspect it first. Oh shit.
[3996.06s -> 4009.83s]  I'm not inspecting it. That's right. Perform a visual inspection. Oh fuck. I like plastered
[4009.83s -> 4019.32s]  those without knowing what it was. Oh shit. Well, Jerry, you, this is great. You found these fossils,
[4019.32s -> 4029.56s]  but you like mummified them and we're never going to know what they are. Thanks. Okay. Well,
[4029.56s -> 4035.13s]  I know what it is. Are there any more? All right. I get it now. Next time I'll be out there. So this
[4035.13s -> 4056.65s]  is a head, like a skull. What's this music? This is, this song is called the river doth flow.
[4058.57s -> 4078.50s]  I forget the artist, but it's the river. Oops. The river, the river doth flow. I have no idea.
[4079.06s -> 4082.76s]  Okay. So I did it. Now I got to get out of here. I got to go back to the
[4083.88s -> 4087.99s]  campsite. I probably should actually be careful. You can probably dump this.
[4088.89s -> 4095.43s]  I'm going to do the right thing. There's no way in fuck, you know, what the word doth means. It
[4095.43s -> 4121.54s]  means does or do. How's that wrong? Yeah. Like, oh, whether thou doth go or not, whether you will go
[4121.54s -> 4149.37s]  or do or not to be or not to be, thou doth the question. Don't crash into a rock. What does it
[4149.37s -> 4153.13s]  actually mean then? How's that wrong? But what does it actually mean? What does doth mean?
[4153.13s -> 4156.73s]  Does it mean like to do, like to go, like doth, like to do, does?
[4163.70s -> 4166.18s]  It does. Yeah. What are you talking about? Don't make me seem like I'm an idiot.
[4166.82s -> 4180.26s]  Listen to this music. This music got cooler. Can I put this down and open it up and see what's in
[4180.26s -> 4199.38s]  there? All right. Open this. I can't open it. Unknown species. Just throw it over there? No,
[4199.38s -> 4204.78s]  I can't. All right. Open tablet to leave this area and transport the findings to your museum.
[4206.81s -> 4219.59s]  OK, I can hire a worker. OK, so I can go back to the museum. How do I?
[4220.15s -> 4230.63s]  Do you want to send the crates? Yes. Yes, I do. What does doth mean? Tell me or I'll turn the
[4230.63s -> 4233.75s]  stream off right now. I'm going to turn my stream off. I'm going to hit end stream. I'm
[4233.75s -> 4242.25s]  meant to hovering over it right now. What does doth mean? Three, two, one means do. Thank you
[4242.25s -> 4245.93s]  for saving the stream. Lucky, lucky, lucky.
[4252.65s -> 4255.61s]  Preoccupied with collecting and preparing dinosaur bones.
[4256.41s -> 4261.86s]  When I arrived at the museum's lab, it was time to start cleaning what I had found.
[4261.86s -> 4266.50s]  It was a fascinating experience. It required a lot of time and attention.
[4266.50s -> 4279.46s]  The results always worth the effort. There's a lot in this game. It's fun. OK,
[4279.46s -> 4286.79s]  moving the crates around with box cleaning station. That's it. It's so visual. That's why
[4286.79s -> 4292.42s]  I've been able to blow through this tutorial. Look at this. Remove plaster and extract fossil
[4292.42s -> 4300.95s]  from the stone using the available tools. I almost said avalanche. Oh, after extracting
[4300.95s -> 4305.11s]  the fossil, make a decision who should clean this set of bones, you or the museum employee.
[4308.74s -> 4313.88s]  Somebody else is going to do it. If you clean the bones by hand, pay attention to the game
[4313.88s -> 4317.16s]  controls in the upper left corner. Here you'll find some useful features such as focus mode
[4317.16s -> 4326.33s]  and highlighting of uncleaned areas. Oh, that just scared the shit out of me.
[4326.33s -> 4345.16s]  I thought there was a monster in here. What is this thing? Why am I skiing? OK, cool. Get off.
[4353.78s -> 4358.70s]  All right, what do we got in here? Unknown bone, unknown species. Let's take a look.
[4360.55s -> 4394.98s]  All right, let's clean it. Where do I get this off? It's a loot box.
[4394.98s -> 4410.84s]  Do I just carve it this way? Oh, there we go. OK, so now I'm looking for the where was the fossil?
[4411.72s -> 4419.37s]  Right there. Watch out. Don't break it. Don't break it. Can I break it if I'm not careful?
[4425.72s -> 4440.65s]  I'll clean it. I want to do it. Clean it. Whoa. Oh, shit, I broke it. I think I broke it. Did I
[4440.65s -> 4475.11s]  break it? Cleaning scope. Oh, wait, you can see magnified. That's funny. I need to rotate this.
[4475.11s -> 4515.72s]  All right. So what is that? Remember, remember that one? OK, this is going to take too long.
[4515.72s -> 4529.51s]  These just look like the dinosaur chicken nuggets. Well, they are based in reality.
[4529.51s -> 4547.50s]  Send fossil to preparation room. Based, based. Pod watchers skip. Pod watchers don't listen to
[4547.50s -> 4550.62s]  don't you got to let somebody dictate what you should do. You know, listen to one person dictate
[4550.62s -> 4559.34s]  what you should do with like what you do with your time. Think about that. I let somebody tell
[4559.34s -> 4576.01s]  you how to dictate your time, right? Stay. Listen to that guy. All right. Just painting some barbecue
[4576.01s -> 4590.23s]  sauce on these. Is it ready? Now what? Whoa. Am I supposed to do this?
[4594.62s -> 4601.80s]  There's so much going into this. What is going on? Look at how much is going into this.
[4602.44s -> 4610.30s]  There's something kind of like therapeutic about doing what I'm doing, though. This is kind of I
[4610.30s -> 4634.73s]  like this and I upgrade the tools. Are there upgrades in this game? You're ruining them.
[4643.62s -> 4657.98s]  Dinosaur ribs. Those aren't done. That's not done. All right. What's the next step?
[4660.25s -> 4670.84s]  When I drop them into the hot vegetable oil, we got a joint cooking up dinosaur bones like
[4670.84s -> 4682.95s]  you wouldn't believe full of flavor. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[4682.95s -> 4693.46s]  I've been coming here for 25 years. That's Don Stevenson. He got the joint from his granddad.
[4698.60s -> 4705.53s]  So what made you want to eat dinosaur bones? Well, my grandfather was a paleontologist and
[4705.53s -> 4710.55s]  one day he's out there decided to take a little taste snack on some of the bones he had found
[4711.35s -> 4715.08s]  and realized that there was still some pretty delicious marrow in there and some meat still
[4715.08s -> 4724.60s]  there. Well, he opened up this place and I've been taking it all over ever since. He said among us.
[4725.56s -> 4765.37s]  All right. Spin it around. This. Oh my God. This is what it takes to do this.
[4767.00s -> 4782.68s]  Just spray paint them. Whoa. Remember you'd make a bad dentist. It's really simplified, dude.
[4785.98s -> 4791.85s]  Millions of year old fossils. So what you got cooking in here? Well, these are T-Rex legs.
[4794.36s -> 4807.26s]  Only eight of these exist on earth. Oh wow. So you marinate those? Yeah. Water. Water from the sink.
[4807.34s -> 4810.62s]  He goes, he's like goes and dips his finger in the water from the sink in the bucket and goes,
[4813.78s -> 4824.30s]  buddy. Whoa. It's like, that's just, that's just sink water. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.
[4827.16s -> 4830.60s]  Take it from this, put it on this into the skeleton or store it in the museum store room.
[4832.33s -> 4839.54s]  After cleaning and collecting and connecting the skeleton pieces, you can proceed to complete the
[4839.54s -> 4844.34s]  entire dinosaur. When the knowledge tab on your tablet becomes available, you look in the ability
[4844.34s -> 4858.04s]  to manage dinosaur skeletons. Really? And you can move it into an exhibit. That's crazy. Okay.
[4858.04s -> 4868.50s]  Design mode. Oh shit. I don't know where this goes. I don't know where this is supposed to go.
[4871.54s -> 4899.08s]  Oh, now I guess I do. Do I have the whole thing? I do. What the hell is this? Um, I'll take it.
[4899.08s -> 4906.50s]  Don't drop it. Oh, look, it's right here. Oh, whoa. Okay. So I, I'm assuming the other stuff
[4906.50s -> 4926.74s]  is the head and the legs. Drop it and it just shatters. Oh, it's a, it's Bob's dino grill calling.
[4926.74s -> 4929.70s]  I heard you dropped a dinosaur bone and shattered on the ground.
[4929.70s -> 4962.22s]  Mind if I come, come take that for you for like $40. I've been eating here for 25 years. Yeah. So
[4963.26s -> 4968.62s]  you got a statistic for us, don't you? Don't you, Bob? Yes, I do. Yes. Every single person that's
[4968.62s -> 4973.34s]  ever eaten here has gotten sick. Every single one, every single one, every single one guy.
[4981.50s -> 4991.83s]  I think this is the Virta, the vertebrae, but I have to manually clean this. Don't I? All right.
[4991.83s -> 5016.82s]  We're going to do the speed run. Somebody said it'd be a bad dentist. Did you see what I just did?
[5017.46s -> 5044.39s]  I got to get a worker. I need a worker. Why's your face cam shaking? Um, because the wind,
[5044.39s -> 5062.55s]  it's really windy here in Vegas. I told you guys. Jesus. No, it's because my mouse is on my desk
[5062.55s -> 5066.95s]  and my desk is connected to the monitor. The monitor is sitting here and the webcam is on
[5066.95s -> 5081.46s]  the monitor. So when I go like this, I shake the whole thing and I'm like shaking right now here.
[5081.46s -> 5106.39s]  I really probably should put this somewhere else, shouldn't I? These ones are so small. I hate it.
[5106.39s -> 5129.26s]  They're too small. These little meatballs. Oh, I hate it. I just have to do like, they hate them.
[5129.82s -> 5135.50s]  You got, okay. This for those new viewers out there, I hate needing to like hold left mouse
[5135.50s -> 5141.58s]  button down and like trace like really small, tiny little areas really consistently. Oh,
[5141.58s -> 5147.37s]  it just makes me want to scream. It makes me want to scream like, I just want to like just
[5147.37s -> 5152.31s]  get up and run in a fucking circle. I just had like my arm. I hate it. Like it feels fucking,
[5152.31s -> 5156.04s]  I hate it. Oh, funka ass.
[5169.64s -> 5174.12s]  You only got to spray this once. Like don't spray this too much in the bathroom. You know what I
[5174.12s -> 5178.52s]  mean? I know people like, I know if you go to the bathroom, you really don't want anyone to know
[5178.52s -> 5184.28s]  you went to the bathroom. You're doing that. Don't fucking do this. Just literally like this.
[5184.28s -> 5190.87s]  This is all you need. Ready? That's it. And then fucking stop and then just leave. Relax.
[5194.55s -> 5209.51s]  Why can't I? Right on the rotisserie. I love it.
[5221.43s -> 5228.81s]  I'm serious. I would be a horrible dentist. You're right.
[5229.13s -> 5235.61s]  You're like, turn it with your mouth open. The dentist is like really leaning in and slowly
[5235.61s -> 5246.33s]  cleaning each tooth and then goes like, what's he doing? No, sorry, man. I just like, I just
[5246.33s -> 5252.01s]  hate like being like doing tiny little movements. My arm gets lost. I feel weird. I would think
[5252.01s -> 5277.08s]  there was a spider in my mouth. It was the other day. Stop shaking your webcam. Stop shaking your
[5277.08s -> 5283.86s]  webcam. Stop shaking your webcam. I'll put it somewhere else later. I'll like glue it to the
[5283.86s -> 5288.31s]  fucking wall or something. I don't know. Where are you supposed to put a webcam? To like prevent
[5288.31s -> 5294.79s]  that from happening. I don't, you know what I mean? What am I supposed to put a webcam to make this
[5294.79s -> 5316.92s]  not happen? You're the streamer. I mean like you'll use a DSLR with a stand. I'm not using a DSLR.
[5316.92s -> 5333.56s]  No fucking thanks. Nope. I don't want, I don't want you guys to see every individual pore on my face.
[5333.64s -> 5348.71s]  Sorry, not happening. Not, not pushing 40. Not pushing 40. That's not happening. You, we want
[5348.71s -> 5353.11s]  to see you in 4k. I don't want to see me in 4k. So why would I want you to see me in 4k?
[5353.83s -> 5364.55s]  What an insecure millionaire.
[5370.55s -> 5376.79s]  Huh?
[5387.91s -> 5401.13s]  Let's go. This dude's not, what are you saying? We want to see, we want to see your beautiful face.
[5404.49s -> 5409.13s]  You're looking at it, literally looking at it right now. Donate your teeth. What, what do you,
[5409.13s -> 5434.50s]  no shut up. In a nice way, right? Like shut up in a nice way. These bones are so little. All right,
[5434.50s -> 5440.31s]  so I can have somebody do this and I can do like the digging part, right? Do I have to make money
[5440.31s -> 5450.78s]  or something? Or do I have to do these few because it's like that tutorial. This is kind of relaxing
[5450.78s -> 5454.28s]  though. I can see this just kind of hanging out and just doing this. I know exactly what I'm doing
[5454.28s -> 5473.16s]  right now. That other one's definitely the head. No way it's not. It is. This is a big one. Okay,
[5473.16s -> 5485.77s]  so now can I just have somebody do it? Shut up in a respectful way. It's the whole skeleton.
[5486.65s -> 5513.93s]  Can I live in your pores? That is fucking weird. Find that person out. Oh my God, look at this.
[5513.93s -> 5530.71s]  Tons of little things in here. Okay, also preparation room. What happens if I do that?
[5530.71s -> 5545.48s]  Where is it? Does somebody else do it? Do I have to go get it? Oh, okay. Somebody's just doing it.
[5545.48s -> 5555.58s]  Oh, this is way better. Can it be fire? Yeah, I could have had one going while I did the other one.
[5557.26s -> 5568.95s]  They're way faster than you. I just started working here. What is this prestige road map?
[5568.95s -> 5581.21s]  It's almost done. I thought you were being attacked by a serious scam. I can't even say
[5581.21s -> 5595.16s]  serious Sam enemy. This IRL takes about five years. Oh my God, that's so much better.
[5595.16s -> 5605.37s]  So with this, I can put, I can display this. Holy shit, that wind. I feel like my fucking,
[5606.49s -> 5628.28s]  that's scary. They had like, look at these eye bones. Okay. All right, I have a full dinosaur.
[5628.28s -> 5635.05s]  What kind of dinosaur is it? The museum I was doing my internship in was getting ready for
[5635.05s -> 5641.62s]  renovation. I was afraid my classes were about to be cut because of that. I wouldn't have been
[5641.62s -> 5647.38s]  more wrong about this one. Turns out the exhibition hall was being revamped. I was asked to participate
[5647.38s -> 5652.82s]  in the redecoration, but that's not all of it. We were also given a second complete skeleton
[5652.82s -> 5658.58s]  of orthothomimus. Orthothomimus. To turn dinosaurs for one display. Well, let's just say all the
[5658.66s -> 5672.02s]  pictures of dinosaurs. Jesus. This wind is fucking scary, man. All right, put it, let's
[5672.02s -> 5690.76s]  jack it up. I don't even, can you guys hear it? It's violent. Oh my goodness. What the fuck.
[5690.76s -> 5702.30s]  I don't even know you can hear it, but that's fucking insane. Okay, we'll unload. Interior design.
[5709.74s -> 5731.43s]  Tab. Wait, wait up here. Okay, here we go. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off with this. Holy shit.
[5732.23s -> 5747.05s]  Off with this. This wind is scary. I don't know if you guys can hear it. I'm trying to see if you
[5747.05s -> 5754.82s]  can hear it. All right, setting up skeleton. Whoa, you can make it like a habitat. Wow. Okay.
[5755.46s -> 5762.81s]  You can change the skeleton's pose, the grass and stuff. That's cool. Look at the decoration
[5762.81s -> 5784.12s]  symbols. Decorations and shit. This is fun. Rotate and scaling. What? Okay. Okay. Next pose. I can
[5784.12s -> 5797.83s]  pose it. Wait, what? This is cool. All right, hold on. I need to, how do I rotate it? Right there.
[5798.39s -> 5813.13s]  And I want to do a pose. That one's kind of cool. Yep. That's where it's going. Okay. Now. Grass.
[5822.22s -> 5833.64s]  Jesus Christ. Grab, I like the grass or the sand. That's kind of cool too. Turn off the noise gate.
[5833.64s -> 5840.38s]  Oh my God, guys. Okay. I'm going to turn the noise gate off. This is what it sounds like without the
[5840.38s -> 5860.23s]  noise gate. Are you ready? Hold on. Just wait. I mean, you can hear it a little bit, but wait
[5860.23s -> 5873.29s]  till the huge one happens. I just want to catch a big one. I feel like we're like storm watching
[5873.29s -> 5880.98s]  right now. He's going to do a joke, isn't he? No, it's not a joke. It's fucking crazy. Sometimes Vegas
[5882.15s -> 5896.49s]  gets 70 plus mile per hour wins. No, I want a big one to happen before I continue.
[5901.40s -> 5905.96s]  When a big one happens, when every time I go, Jesus, that's what you, that's what I'm reacting
[5905.96s -> 5923.66s]  to. Now it's not going to do it because I'm like waiting for it to happen. No, he's going to just
[5923.66s -> 5934.58s]  do a huge fart. I'm like, okay guys, wait for it. And I just go like, that would be really funny.
[5934.58s -> 5942.74s]  It would be like, that would piss a lot of you off, but all right, I'm going to give this like
[5942.74s -> 5973.59s]  20 or 30 more seconds. 10 more seconds. Viewers dropping. It's, I don't care. 10 seconds. Come
[5973.59s -> 5987.32s]  on, just do it so I can stop doing this. Viewers rising. I don't care. That was a mini one. 10
[5987.32s -> 6016.81s]  seconds. Every time I talk, it happens. It doesn't want to do it now. Whatever. Okay. Just know that
[6016.81s -> 6044.28s]  it's really crazy. You know what I mean? What does that sound like? I just fucking screamed into the
[6044.28s -> 6057.22s]  mic. Can you hear it? Okay. Let's get back to what we were doing. That's unfortunate. I really want,
[6057.22s -> 6067.77s]  I want you guys to hear it. Okay. So it's like you're trapped in a box of frosted flakes.
[6071.32s -> 6084.14s]  Hello. Is that what it sounded like? I'm going to go with the stones. A huge one just happened
[6084.14s -> 6097.40s]  and I get right when I turn it off. I only have one plant. Big plants. No, we'll get rid of that.
[6097.40s -> 6129.02s]  Freeze. Grass. All right. That's fine. That looks good. Perfect. Looks good to me. Wait a minute.
[6129.10s -> 6140.25s]  Take out. Oh shit. I need, I need more room. I guess get fit here. Uh, how do I move this back
[6140.25s -> 6156.26s]  again? That's okay. Um, this, I need to, can I, what should I sell this? Like the stupid fucking
[6156.26s -> 6162.36s]  Zamboni machines in the way. How do I get rid of that? Back, back up. I have to get, move this
[6162.36s -> 6188.01s]  thing. Ooh, this is pretty fucking cool. I like that. That's, that's pretty museum like. I like
[6188.01s -> 6195.74s]  this one. All right. Walls. Ooh, I like that. I like this one. I like this one. No, I don't.
[6196.86s -> 6203.05s]  This one's good. All right. Decorations. We need a bench here so people can sit and look at them,
[6203.05s -> 6217.21s]  fighting each other. I want to plant over here. No, a little bigger than that. Paintings. Stacker
[6217.21s -> 6242.02s]  them. Stacker them. Cool. I found that. That doesn't look bad. All right. Now I need to,
[6242.02s -> 6260.90s]  I got to, can I move this over? I got to move this here. It's kind of in the way though,
[6260.90s -> 6277.80s]  isn't it? Wait, what's that mean? Oh, I, I, this thing's, how do I make it so I can fit it?
[6277.80s -> 6287.96s]  Paintings suck. Make it one big exhibit. Yeah. How do I do that? Can I put them both in here?
[6287.96s -> 6299.18s]  I could make it just one huge exhibit, right? And then put the other one in. I can. All right.
[6299.18s -> 6312.82s]  Nice. Nice. Nice. This is perfect. Okay. So I want to put this one here, rotate it. It's too big.
[6312.82s -> 6327.40s]  That's not bad. If it right there. All right. I want to pose him though. That's all right.
[6327.40s -> 6337.34s]  That looks fine. We need some more plants and shit though. Move this over here. This looks pretty
[6337.34s -> 6350.58s]  good. That looks fine. Okay. Now we need, um, there's a little like bird nest for this. All
[6350.58s -> 6364.49s]  right. That's good. We got it. Look. Beautiful. Stunning. Close these fucking windows. I don't
[6364.49s -> 6373.98s]  want people looking in here for free. Cut these up. Ooh. Oh. Ooh. Ooh. What's that dinosaur claw?
[6373.98s -> 6383.46s]  Whoa. I'm in a weird mood tonight and I'm really sorry. That was the last day of a
[6383.46s -> 6396.52s]  too symmetrical adventure. Just believe it's a weird phone. The director called to ask me to stay
[6396.52s -> 6402.26s]  and help the museum build a bigger skeleton. There was a vacant position because one of the
[6402.26s -> 6410.25s]  workers got sick. I felt bad for the guy, but I was so glad there was a chance to work in the museum
[6410.25s -> 6418.50s]  for longer. The decision was a no brainer. I went to the museum the next day. Although the place
[6418.50s -> 6424.02s]  wasn't new to me, this particular moment felt different. It was the first time I was asked to
[6424.02s -> 6429.86s]  enter the museum's workshop with my heart pounding and my hands sweating. I walked towards the door.
[6436.17s -> 6449.22s]  Okay. Just in case I got to shake somebody's hand. Oh wow. This is a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[6449.22s -> 6456.14s]  I've got to admit, bigger skeleton the director was talking about was indeed a huge one. I was
[6456.14s -> 6462.54s]  dumbstruck when I was faced with the legendary Tyrannosaurus. Even in my dreams, I would never
[6462.54s -> 6485.67s]  fathom that our museum was in possession of such a treasure. Complete the T-Rex. You got it. Oh.
[6485.67s -> 6514.42s]  Oh. Collectively, everybody in the room. Oh. Oh. This is tongue. Never mind. Shut up, please.
[6516.10s -> 6545.27s]  Okay. I'll shut up. How am I supposed to get those up here? I have to walk. I can throw. I can't. I
[6545.27s -> 6554.52s]  have to walk individually. No, I don't. So I could have decorated this place too. When do we stop
[6554.52s -> 6583.19s]  making money? What I want to know. I want to go dig some more. That was really fun. Oh, I did it.
[6583.19s -> 6601.70s]  The hidden skeleton of Tyrannosaurus looked majestic and I had the honor to contribute to it.
[6601.70s -> 6605.78s]  Yet another beautiful moment that has been etched in my memory. Open your window? No.
[6610.17s -> 6616.33s]  It sounds like Interstellar. It does. It does. If I saw the movie, which I haven't. I don't know.
[6616.33s -> 6620.09s]  It's pretty amped up. I've never seen that movie. Just pretended to know what you meant.
[6620.09s -> 6626.41s]  Finding a job, but that was about to change soon. For the first six months after graduation,
[6626.41s -> 6631.29s]  my focus was to find a job in the field of paleontology, or at least something that
[6631.29s -> 6636.17s]  relates to it. I submitted my resume for every paleontologist job I could find. But didn't I
[6636.17s -> 6641.53s]  get a job already? Jobs were either already taken or I lacked the experience. After six months,
[6641.53s -> 6647.61s]  I started looking for any job, but that also didn't come easily. I was trying hard, but to
[6647.61s -> 6652.81s]  no avail. Not a good movie, but everyone saw it. I didn't see it. One year after graduation,
[6652.81s -> 6657.53s]  things finally started to turn around. Although it wasn't exactly how I had imagined it.
[6660.30s -> 6668.42s]  Did I give my Spider-Man take yet? Did I give my new Spider-Man movie take yet?
[6668.42s -> 6676.39s]  Okay. I didn't. Okay. Let me give you my Spider-Man. Just real quick. The second half
[6677.51s -> 6682.54s]  of the Spider-Man No Way Home movie felt like a college humor video.
[6684.63s -> 6691.69s]  Is it? That's the take I'm going to have. That's the only take I'm going to give you.
[6697.80s -> 6710.07s]  It felt like an old college humor video from like 2011, 2008. Did I think it was a bad movie?
[6710.07s -> 6721.64s]  No. It was very enjoyable. It was very enjoyable. I almost kind of felt like
[6723.35s -> 6728.95s]  the second, like third of the movie. I was expecting actors to look into the camera and smile
[6729.83s -> 6736.26s]  after saying anything. Like, oh yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what I was expecting.
[6738.34s -> 6747.70s]  After every three or four lines. I thought it was good. I liked it. I liked it, but I felt like I
[6747.70s -> 6754.01s]  was just watching a movie. You know what I mean? It was like a movie. It was like, hey, we're making
[6754.01s -> 6759.05s]  a movie right now. Do you know there's a movie on the screen? It was like, hey, I just want to let
[6759.05s -> 6765.50s]  you know that you're watching a movie right now. Hey, this is a movie. You like movies, don't you?
[6765.50s -> 6768.78s]  You've seen movies, haven't you? You're a big fan of movies. I like movies too.
[6772.94s -> 6784.20s]  Am I, is this my house? Hey, let me, I'm going to be very honest with you. Spider-Man is my
[6784.20s -> 6789.96s]  favorite character in everything. It's not Batman. It's not Captain America. It's Spider-Man. Spider-Man
[6789.96s -> 6795.56s]  is my favorite character. And I think the trilogy was the best Spider-Man trilogy, the best Spider-Man
[6795.56s -> 6802.18s]  movies that they've ever made. Oh, but what about Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie? All right, get out,
[6802.18s -> 6809.40s]  let go of me. Yeah, they're great. But I think they, I think this trilogy was great. I think they were
[6809.40s -> 6817.03s]  great. Like Homecoming, it's fucking amazing. Far From Home, I loved it. This one, I liked it.
[6817.67s -> 6831.34s]  I really liked it. I liked it. I liked it a lot. That's it. Venom, be careful. How do I go in my
[6831.34s -> 6841.66s]  house? Where are my keys? But a part of me almost felt like in some of the scenes in the new Spider-Man
[6841.66s -> 6847.34s]  movie, like the director was just going to start walking around on the set with like a fucking stone
[6847.34s -> 6851.50s]  in his hand, with like the thing in his hand, like just be like, this looks good. Okay. Just like
[6851.50s -> 6861.82s]  walking around in the background. All right, how do I, select drone? No, I want to go, how do I go
[6861.82s -> 6876.26s]  into my house? What was the objective? 35 year old man complains about comic book movies. I'm not
[6876.26s -> 6883.96s]  complaining. That's not a complaint. That was a very, very mild observation. It was mild. It was
[6883.96s -> 6892.28s]  very, very mild. Okay. How do I go in my house? Holy shit. I get every channel on every from every
[6892.28s -> 6899.06s]  country that literally every country on earth. I get all their TV stations. I'd love to get in here.
[6899.62s -> 6906.87s]  That was a mild take. Okay. Come on. Oh my God. What is this? Why is there a car made out of
[6906.87s -> 6916.90s]  ground beef in my house? How do I get in here? What's going on? How do I get in the house?
[6917.42s -> 6921.75s]  I have to go in the garage? Why can't I go in my front door?
[6926.04s -> 6936.28s]  Oh, watch out for the red barrels. Dude, I'm sorry. I'm not going in there if there's red
[6936.28s -> 6941.22s]  barrels. Like bright red barrels is like, those explode. I'm not going in there.
[6954.73s -> 6959.37s]  His body didn't catch up with his spirit and he had to pass on his little project.
[6959.37s -> 6967.06s]  I decided to clean up the workshop for him. Yeah, dude. I don't know. You've like bright
[6967.06s -> 6972.82s]  red barrels with like the flame sign on them. We are slowly getting these out of the house.
[6972.82s -> 6987.11s]  We're removing these. Okay. What am I doing? Can I just like, no, I can't. What does this happen?
[6987.11s -> 6996.07s]  What the fuck, dude? What is going on in here? Yeah. My grandfather collected exploding barrels
[6996.07s -> 7000.97s]  and he kept them all in his garage for some fucking reason. I don't know why. I don't know why.
[7005.02s -> 7015.30s]  Do I have to fix the car? What the fuck was in there? Wash your hands. Wash your hands.
[7015.30s -> 7019.86s]  Grandpa was shitting into a box. Wash your hands immediately. Go wash your hands right now.
[7019.86s -> 7029.70s]  I lost fossil piece that I found during the school trip. Despite it being over 15 years ago,
[7029.70s -> 7034.90s]  I felt the exact same mix of excitement and joy that I'd felt on that beach years ago.
[7034.90s -> 7046.46s]  The desire to search for fossils has become immediately obvious with full force. All my
[7046.46s -> 7051.74s]  problems. This game is cool. I actually think this is fun and game. I just had to put it
[7051.74s -> 7057.00s]  into action. I started implementing my plan by acquiring a set of excavation tools.
[7057.00s -> 7063.62s]  This was possible thanks to a garage sale. Wait, now we're not going to glaze over the fact that
[7063.62s -> 7070.55s]  grandpa has a bunch of like fucking gas tanks in his garage? I thought those were like guns.
[7071.27s -> 7079.50s]  Like oh my like rifle collection. Okay. Look at your desk from time to time. You may find a pale
[7079.50s -> 7083.42s]  intelligent dude. There's a lot of content in this game. I'm not going to let the negative Andes
[7083.42s -> 7087.82s]  here tell me. There's a lot of interesting content. This is cool. I think this is actually pretty
[7087.82s -> 7102.84s]  cool. I do. Okay. Like you can paint. Wait, I can mess with the car? In the next room in the garage,
[7102.84s -> 7108.17s]  the museum, you can see a map on the wall. It will show available locations that you can travel to.
[7108.17s -> 7117.85s]  Can I go to Nevada? If Nevada is in this game and I can go to like Las Vegas, this is a B plus. This
[7117.85s -> 7127.61s]  game is a B. You can also find here collectible items discovered during research expeditions.
[7128.17s -> 7139.35s]  This is like my house. This is cool. Okay. So what's on the news?
[7139.99s -> 7157.24s]  Dinosaur skeletons are waiting to be discovered. There's a toy. Hard difficulty.
[7158.04s -> 7284.50s]  Don't get me. I don't want to do that. All right. Let's um, let's go. Okay. Those elbows are a little
[7284.50s -> 7327.91s]  fucked up. He's supposed to be going like this, like with his arms, like on his side. He's like a
[7327.91s -> 7368.87s]  muscle shirt button up on. All right. Now I need one more finishing touch. Those teeth are kind of
[7368.87s -> 7376.76s]  fucked up. Um, this is just like somebody drawing like their boss. You know what I mean? Like, oh,
[7376.76s -> 7394.94s]  there he is. That motherfucker. Like, oh, this is the boss. You're gonna get fired. This is too much
[7394.94s -> 7405.74s]  empty space up here. There's too much empty space up here. I'm not happy with this piece.
[7405.74s -> 7411.99s]  I ain't happy with this. Get back to work. Yeah. I crumpled it up before the boss gets over.
[7411.99s -> 7420.17s]  I'm like, what you working on over there? That's just, uh, just like, you know, stats and shit.
[7420.90s -> 7427.72s]  I was drawing the boss. There's too much empty space here. I'm not happy with this. I'm going
[7427.72s -> 7448.50s]  to throw it all away. Put sunglasses on them. No, no, I'm not happy with this. How about like a house
[7448.50s -> 7457.34s]  in the background, right? We got to have like some, some, uh, focal point, right? Yeah. He's
[7457.34s -> 7464.54s]  in the foreground. Don't adjust your fucking TV, man. Don't adjust your screen. This is perspective
[7464.54s -> 7533.96s]  here. He's in the foreground. Don't be alarmed. This guy's scary. The house shouldn't be like alive.
[7538.39s -> 7543.80s]  He's focusing. I feel like this is okay. Don't they do those things where it's like the way you
[7543.80s -> 7550.54s]  draw a house, the way you draw a person, the way you draw a son. Isn't this like, you can determine
[7550.54s -> 7554.30s]  the kind of like personality, like psychology that I have or something, right? I feel like I just did
[7554.30s -> 7565.77s]  all of those. So there you go. All right. Now what do I, how do I, what do I do with this?
[7565.77s -> 7574.15s]  It's just going to be there. Can I hang this up? I definitely did not draw these. I did not,
[7574.15s -> 7589.00s]  the same person did not draw those at all. What the fuck? Dinosaurs on Mars. Okay. So now what do
[7589.00s -> 7599.46s]  I do? I get, I'm trapped in here. Get me out of here. All right. I'm fine. Holy shit. What did you
[7599.46s -> 7614.66s]  get a military vehicle? Why do I have a military truck? I'm sorry, guys. They both have to be
[7614.66s -> 7651.91s]  Jurassic park theme trucks. Okay. Oh, you've, you've really leaning into that here. That's good. Okay.
[7651.91s -> 7679.18s]  I'm ready. Make it bright pink. It's like a big bubble gum car. All right. That's good. Oh,
[7679.18s -> 7689.72s]  Jerma. Oh, I know. Hey, Jerma. All right. Now what do I do? That was my blue though. I need blue.
[7689.72s -> 7697.46s]  I need to, okay. I need a third car. And that third car has to be like an aqua, like a teal.
[7697.46s -> 7707.16s]  Nice Thanos truck. It's not the Thanos truck. It's literally bubble gum pink. What kind of
[7707.16s -> 7712.12s]  insane person puts their lawnmower on a shelf like this? Am I weird for not ever doing that?
[7712.12s -> 7735.90s]  What do I do with this stuff? These are all locked. It's all locked. Am I insane for not
[7735.90s -> 7741.93s]  doing? How do you just get it down? Like how do you pull it down? There's a lot of tools.
[7741.93s -> 7750.52s]  Okay. Where's my, what do I have to do? Messages. Travel. I think I just go, right? I just go
[7750.52s -> 7764.82s]  somewhere else. Knowledge. Management. Whoa. Oh, I have no points. Workers. How do I get out of here?
[7764.82s -> 7785.53s]  What do I do? How do I like get out of here? Travel. I have no destinations. I got no destinations.
[7785.53s -> 7803.34s]  I have to read the newspaper. Play Fortnite instead. I would never mind. How do I get out of here?
[7803.34s -> 7814.71s]  You should dig here. Oh, there we go. Okay. All right. We're going up to Canada. Canada.
[7814.71s -> 7827.80s]  We're going to be taking the grandpa truck into Canada. I need some more of this. I need some
[7827.80s -> 7834.68s]  more of my drink. Can we take a quick break? Right. So can I can go fill up my drink again?
[7834.68s -> 7843.29s]  I'm gonna fill my drink up. I'll be right back. I want more of a drink. It's green tea. Relax.
[7843.29s -> 7853.29s]  I'll be right back. Well, it's green tea with vitamins. With vitamins. All right,
[7853.29s -> 8122.70s]  baby. Boys and girls, I have a treat for you. I have a treat for you. I completely forgot about
[8122.70s -> 8135.35s]  this until I just was reminded. So the Vata Science Center, if you guys remember, this past year,
[8137.38s -> 8145.51s]  we did that kind of all the raising the money and stuff. And the community was able to give
[8145.51s -> 8158.09s]  them $10,000, if you remember. Pretty cool shit. They sent, they sent some really cool shit.
[8158.73s -> 8161.77s]  I don't even know what half of it is, but let's, you want to examine it? It's like,
[8161.77s -> 8170.68s]  they sent literally fossils. Actual fossils here. You really want to take a look? Let's take a look.
[8171.40s -> 8179.75s]  I don't know what a lot of this stuff is, but we'll find out, right? The game can wait for
[8179.75s -> 8200.76s]  just a sec. Oh my God. I look crazed. Okay. So let's take a look at some of this stuff.
[8200.76s -> 8209.72s]  They're in these little bags. I think this is, I don't know what this is, but it's some type of
[8209.72s -> 8217.94s]  fossilized like pyrite. There's a bunch of these. There's like at least four or five of these. It's
[8217.94s -> 8227.42s]  in this cute little bag. I think this is for fools gold. Yeah. Hey, that's cool. You see? Very cool.
[8227.42s -> 8235.27s]  But that's not necessarily a fossil, right? This is. Be careful. I don't like break this. I think
[8235.27s -> 8242.50s]  this is like a tooth. I think they explained what they were. I just don't remember. Take a look at
[8242.50s -> 8249.78s]  this thing. This is crazy looking. Yeah. Look at this. This is like, this is, look at this thing.
[8249.78s -> 8261.02s]  This is like a tooth. What is this? Isn't that crazy looking? This is like a dinosaur tooth or
[8261.02s -> 8269.30s]  like a shark tooth. It's moving on the other side, right? But over here, it's really tiny fossilized
[8269.30s -> 8279.77s]  like shark tooth or fossilized dinosaur tooth. That one's really cool. Is it a plant? It looks
[8279.77s -> 8289.82s]  like a tooth. That's a crustacean, you idiot. No, this is a crustacean, you idiot. Oh my God. This
[8289.82s -> 8298.78s]  is kind of delicate. This is like a, whoa. I don't even remember seeing this one. This is a
[8298.78s -> 8309.24s]  fossilized cinnamon bun roll. Fossilized cinnamon bun roll. That's like a shell. It's like a seashell.
[8309.24s -> 8325.61s]  Look at that. Let me get a better view here. It's pretty detailed. You can't really see maybe,
[8325.61s -> 8336.97s]  but it's really detailed. It's like a nautilus or something, right? There's another one here too.
[8336.97s -> 8350.94s]  What's this one? Whoa. This one feels weird. What the fuck is this? Whoa. This one's crazy.
[8350.94s -> 8356.78s]  Oh my God. It's like a, it's a fucking skeleton. This is actually a skeleton. Are you ready for
[8356.78s -> 8377.38s]  the reveal? Check this out. It's like a rib cage or something. Look at that. It's like a,
[8377.38s -> 8389.21s]  of like an animal's rib cage. It's like embedded in there. It's crazy looking. It's like a big
[8389.21s -> 8400.65s]  fossilized bug or something, whatever it is. What's it called? It's trilobite. It's an ancient pill
[8400.65s -> 8412.92s]  bug. All of a sudden, like six legs break out from the sides and like, like crawls in my mouth.
[8413.00s -> 8421.35s]  What is, what is that? Extinct marine anthropods that form one of the earliest known groups of
[8421.35s -> 8429.51s]  anthropods. The first appearance. So this is a legit fucking real animal here. Whoa. Whoa. It's
[8429.51s -> 8441.06s]  weird. It's like, you can see its tail. I didn't show you this part. See, see like that ridge in
[8441.06s -> 8449.67s]  the middle there. That's like its tail. Whoa. This is weird. Whoa. Cool. All right. It's going
[8449.67s -> 8463.96s]  back in the bag. That's what they looked like? Dude, it moved. I want to look at this one again.
[8464.28s -> 8470.30s]  You guys saying this is not a tooth. This is like a leaf. I know for a fact that they described them
[8470.30s -> 8475.03s]  when they sent them. I just kind of forget. It's been a while. Yeah. Look at the pattern on that.
[8475.03s -> 8494.89s]  That's insane looking. Look at it. It's like a, is it a leaf? It's wild looking. Some kind of shell.
[8494.89s -> 8500.33s]  Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Well, what a perfect time to do that. I'm probably going to wash my hands.
[8500.33s -> 8507.03s]  I think. I don't know. I feel like if you touch like a 5 million year old animal, I feel like
[8507.03s -> 8511.78s]  I don't want to like put my hands on my face. Is that weird? Like, I feel like I should wash my hands.
[8511.78s -> 8516.02s]  Shouldn't I? All right. I'll be right back. I'm going to wash my hands. Give me one second.
[8560.41s -> 8569.27s]  Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I don't want to have like some 10 million year old bacteria
[8569.27s -> 8583.80s]  get into my body or something. All right. Let's go. It's a rock. It doesn't matter.
[8583.80s -> 8588.14s]  Remember it's a rock. I don't know. It could be something. It could be embedded. Some kind
[8588.14s -> 8594.23s]  of bacteria or something. Who eats rocks? I'm not going to put like my hands on a rock and
[8594.23s -> 8610.58s]  put my hands in my mouth. I put my hands in my face all the time. You did. You eat rocks.
[8610.58s -> 8618.26s]  That was, that was for research purposes, not for to eat for pleasure, right? That wasn't for me.
[8618.26s -> 8623.06s]  I wasn't hungry. That was for research purposes to determine where, how old that rock could have
[8623.06s -> 8638.79s]  been. That was for research purposes. That was for me to determine how old the rock was. I think he's
[8638.79s -> 8653.75s]  on meth. That was cool. They look like face huggers. Yeah they do.
[8654.47s -> 8680.60s]  Look up isopods. They're like dinosaur bugs. Yeah that's, they're scary. They're scary. Okay.
[8681.80s -> 8693.37s]  Back to the game. Oh I'm in like, this is a bigger open world now. All right. So we're going to go
[8693.37s -> 8698.89s]  through the same thing. What's the map look like? Where's the dig site? There is none. I just have
[8698.89s -> 8715.59s]  to go find it. Let's go. Mouse sensitivity has got to go down, like way down. There we go. Do I have
[8715.59s -> 8723.93s]  enough boxes? I need boxes. I need my excavation equipment to be loaded. Changing cars and fast
[8723.93s -> 8730.26s]  travel. Yeah you can change cars and travel around. Off-road. An important part of the hub
[8730.26s -> 8735.56s]  is the laptop workstation. Change the car if you feel like it. Okay. Fuel tanks are used to refill
[8735.56s -> 8741.10s]  gas canisters. I feel like that's not going to be too important but it might be later. On the hub
[8741.10s -> 8744.78s]  you'll find the equipment necessary to set up your excavation as well as empty boxes for transporting
[8744.78s -> 8749.75s]  fossils. Put the crates with the fossils that you want to transport to the museum in the highlighted
[8749.75s -> 8761.16s]  area. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let's go. Press E. Okay I want a few of these right?
[8761.72s -> 8770.46s]  Car managing station. Car switching and fast travel. Once you have hired the right employees
[8770.46s -> 8775.50s]  to be able to use the fast travel tab. Yeah you need to hire employees to fast travel. That's
[8775.50s -> 8786.58s]  good to know. And I can just switch cars with the laptop. Okay. Hack digging tools. Car trunk
[8786.58s -> 8807.72s]  is full. With what? What's in the trunk? What do you mean it's full? Pick up canister. Canister
[8807.72s -> 8821.77s]  into the car. Okay. All right so we're good right? These simple crates can be packed only into the
[8821.77s -> 8827.98s]  back of the trunk which is occupied at the moment. So why? Can I not bring these? Are they? I think
[8827.98s -> 8841.99s]  there's already a couple already in there. I don't know. I need to make two trips. What about over
[8841.99s -> 8861.29s]  here? Can I like go over there? Is it my free to explore now? What should I set up? What about
[8861.29s -> 8869.16s]  like right here? Being in the mine. Dumbledore's voice? Notice the excavation area in its lowest
[8869.16s -> 8874.12s]  part. This is where I was to start my search. When have I ever done a Dumbledore impression? Strong
[8874.12s -> 8879.24s]  wind to destroy the excavation equipment. So my first job was to clean up the exploration area
[8879.24s -> 8886.39s]  and set up a new fence. I've never done a Dumbledore impression. Well okay I'll try. Oh Harry
[8887.35s -> 8894.04s]  as you know the three houses must come together in harmony Harry. Like that? Is that good?
[8899.66s -> 8919.61s]  So much shit everywhere. Hold on. That was Voldemort. That was Harry Potter Dumbledore.
[8941.96s -> 8950.06s]  Oh yes his full name. Harry Potter Dumbledore. No I said name of the series colon name of the
[8950.06s -> 8970.14s]  character. Hey there's so much. Okay I do have to clear the whole road of this bullshit.
[8970.94s -> 8984.50s]  I'm not doing it. I'm just clearing this part to drive over it. Do your classic Cookie Monster
[8984.50s -> 8990.55s]  voice. Cookie Monsters like Tasmanian Devil. You have to go all in or it's not going to work.
[8993.96s -> 8998.12s]  You can't do a Cookie Monster impression by just going like oh it's me. No no no you have to go
[8998.12s -> 9014.33s]  all in please. All right four-wheel drive come on. I don't want to clear this whole thing. I just
[9014.33s -> 9027.86s]  want to go. Maybe it'll unstuck me on the other side. You just put me on top of these. Wait no
[9027.86s -> 9045.82s]  it worked. Oh my god come on unstuck it again. I'm already over the thing. I'm already there.
[9045.82s -> 9051.42s]  There we go. All right we're good. So where do I want to set up shop here?
[9056.65s -> 9060.39s]  Do a Cookie Monster impression now. I forget what Cookie Monster sounds like.
[9063.21s -> 9072.55s]  It's like it's like you need like almost like a voice changer with it. Hold on.
[9072.55s -> 9079.35s]  What does Cookie Monster sound like? It's like um what does it sound like? It's kind of like
[9085.93s -> 9092.46s]  cookies. I love cookies right? Something like that. I don't know it's something like that.
[9097.61s -> 9101.30s]  The problem is that I didn't I didn't go all in. Let me try to let me go all in with it and see
[9101.30s -> 9112.52s]  what happens. This cookie is delicious. I love cookies. Oh yes cookies. That's not that's not
[9112.52s -> 9120.73s]  really not that good but I mean it's how do you even do it? It's so gravely that it kind of hurts.
[9122.78s -> 9131.85s]  That's just an orc. Done building ship. Done building ship.
[9132.49s -> 9139.67s]  We need more gold. I'm done doing that. I'm not doing it ever fucking again for the rest
[9139.67s -> 9155.35s]  of my life. None of you are going to hear that ever again. I promise. You notice it's the ow.
[9156.42s -> 9164.52s]  It's the dob dob dob part. I fucking hate that. Don't you? Like the dob dob dob nom nom right?
[9164.52s -> 9183.50s]  It's like shut up. I hate it. That's the worst impression. No it's not. It's not even close.
[9186.42s -> 9200.52s]  All right I gotta secure the area. Secure it. Left mouse button. I need to secure this area.
[9200.52s -> 9216.17s]  Let's go. Secure it. Secure it. Secure it. I can't. I'm clicking. Secure it. Secure the area. Oh there
[9216.17s -> 9221.91s]  we go. All right we can skip this. I'm excited now. Now we get to actually do the the fun part.
[9224.07s -> 9239.94s]  Why would I drop down to the sky? Okay use your laptop to transport crates by drones.
[9239.94s -> 9246.36s]  Oh I can call it? Really? Well let's just let's do this. Let's get started here. Other tool
[9246.36s -> 9261.37s]  information. What about the other tools? Underwater fossil searching. Okay turn it on. Suck out all the
[9261.37s -> 9271.90s]  water. All right diving. Dry the area. Suck out all the water. Shallow water that blocks digging
[9271.90s -> 9275.50s]  must be pumped out with a diesel water pump. Place it in the highlighted spot. Turn it on and wait
[9275.50s -> 9280.89s]  until the water is completely pumped out. And then connect the lamp in case it gets dark out.
[9280.89s -> 9288.78s]  And then you got a generator just in case it gets some new electricity. All right other tools. All
[9288.78s -> 9306.90s]  right let's go. Uh let's pump it up. Wait I need my uh device right? These have fossils in them?
[9310.65s -> 9325.35s]  I'm fucking drowning. Okay okay you can die. All right I need my um this is a death mechanic. You
[9325.35s -> 9347.37s]  almost became a fossil. I need um my thing. Uh where's the the little ghost buster tool? Did
[9347.37s -> 9362.65s]  I bring my ghost buster tool? There it is. I'm just gonna go clean them up and throw them over
[9362.65s -> 9384.68s]  here. Just remember that's where those are. All right let's do an inspection here. Anything? Nope
[9384.68s -> 9393.37s]  what about the one I threw over here? Nope nope okay. I have to take them out and throw them.
[9393.37s -> 9400.87s]  There's a giant gold nugget. What would that be worth? A gold nugget this big would be worth
[9400.87s -> 9416.74s]  how much? Like a few million? Isn't this some asteroid or something that's worth like 50
[9416.74s -> 9429.56s]  trillion dollars in gold or something? Yes there is. There is right? Am I just making that up?
[9429.56s -> 9446.66s]  All right I gotta check on these ones. My uncle has that asteroid. Are you serious?
[9447.22s -> 9474.55s]  You're not even you're not subscribed. What he's these guys this this guy's got a net worth of
[9474.55s -> 9493.08s]  like 50 trillion dollars. All right let me check these. But what if he doesn't like your stream?
[9493.08s -> 9504.52s]  What if he does though? There's nothing in any of these shitty rocks. Something's moving in this
[9504.52s -> 9523.02s]  one. This one's gonna hatch. Okay I don't want to get confused because I'll- my uncle learned how
[9523.02s -> 9536.82s]  to do a kick flip last week. You're not subscribed either but you didn't celebrate your uncle's kick
[9536.82s -> 9547.54s]  flip and subscribe here? Really? I don't think there's anything even down here. I'm just doing
[9547.54s -> 9561.45s]  this for no reason. So uncool. Yeah I mean that's like not cool. I don't want to have to keep
[9561.45s -> 9572.78s]  coming down here throwing rocks. Can I just suck up all the water? One of these has to have something
[9572.78s -> 9607.46s]  right? Yeah! What is it? I can't identify it. Oh he's he's he's having a monologue here.
[9615.56s -> 9619.77s]  What's huge? What is it? What did you find?
[9625.72s -> 9635.72s]  All right is it gold? No it's something something actually pretty important I think. I think it's
[9635.72s -> 9642.15s]  important. General Macerous Albertensis.
[9648.23s -> 9655.59s]  Oh shit my power might go up. Did you see that? Uh oh.
[9661.46s -> 9670.73s]  Uh did it blink? Did you guys see the power like that the lights just like uh okay well
[9670.73s -> 9685.38s]  oh power doesn't go up. There's probably more in here. It's probably the whole dinosaur for
[9685.38s -> 9691.78s]  god's sake. I'm gonna have to do this. Okay just bear with me. It's gonna be the whole
[9691.78s -> 9694.90s]  dinosaur down here. Yeah of course it is. All right the whole dinosaur is down here.
[9708.33s -> 9725.37s]  That's such an excuse to end the stream early. Bro my power just flickered. What?
[9727.30s -> 9734.07s]  Like you could just see the lights flick. I I said oh man uh power's gonna go off probably
[9734.07s -> 9737.75s]  guys sorry stream's probably uh what are you talking about? You just you just watched it.
[9738.70s -> 9768.10s]  Save the game? I got an autosave. Junk. Wait what happened to the one I just was looking at?
[9768.10s -> 9775.59s]  Where is it? Okay that's the tail. Yeah this is the same one. Tail set two. Back right limb.
[9775.59s -> 9780.38s]  All right send this back to the um I gotta send these back all right send these back.
[9780.38s -> 9790.42s]  20 fingers am I holding up? Zero. You're typing in a chat room. All right small crate. Delivery
[9790.42s -> 9804.52s]  of crates called drone. Do I not have it? I can't do it? Did I not upgrade it? Nothing here right?
[9805.32s -> 9813.96s]  There's definitely at least one or two. The head has to be in here. The whole thing's in here.
[9813.96s -> 9820.50s]  Bro just carry them. I don't want to carry them. What are you talking about? That's so far.
[9821.14s -> 9830.86s]  Can I throw these out? No. I'll do three at a time. That's probably easiest.
[9831.42s -> 9856.38s]  Bingo. Oh two here. Okay let's break it up. This game I like this game. I'm skipping class
[9856.38s -> 9863.11s]  for the stream. You need to be funny. No you need to go to class and turn off your phone or your
[9863.11s -> 9868.22s]  laptop whatever it is and not be watching the stream. What are you doing?
[9871.18s -> 9872.78s]  You need to be focusing on class right now.
[9880.87s -> 9889.82s]  Okay so this is plastered up. Can these fit in with more than one thing? You're learning
[9889.82s -> 9905.45s]  archaeology right now. Do your fucking homework. Do your homework. All right that's a left limb. I
[9905.45s -> 9913.54s]  don't have enough space. I need more crates. Um all right well I have to I gotta what do I do
[9913.54s -> 9936.12s]  with this? I can't hold on. You're such a teacher. I need to have a drone come pick it up. Wait can
[9936.12s -> 9949.02s]  I just do it? How come you're so catty tonight? I don't know. What do you what does that mean?
[9949.02s -> 9961.38s]  Why am I so catty? Am I catty tonight? Name the field of research. This is paleontology.
[9972.74s -> 9976.82s]  Okay well I can at least store the other ones. Have to come back and upgrade or something.
[9976.82s -> 9986.73s]  Can I put this on the roof? Dude I can't even store this on the roof. Are you shitting me?
[9986.73s -> 10006.52s]  I need to put it in the storage area for the drone. I can't. Shit. Oh well I think I can at least
[10006.52s -> 10021.86s]  store this one. Um okay so where do I get another pallet right here? Small crate three to six.
[10021.86s -> 10027.75s]  Large crates. I can't. I don't think I can pick these up. I think I actually have to drive that back.
[10028.47s -> 10045.91s]  All the drone. Yeah I can't. I don't think I have it like unlocked. I don't think I have it unlocked.
[10046.42s -> 10053.94s]  My uncle is skipping work to watch the stream. These aren't. You're in a
[10053.94s -> 10061.77s]  set stop. The laptop. Yeah look look look look. I just. What? Laptop. Management station. E.
[10061.77s -> 10069.61s]  I can't do anything. Pallet two. Small crate full. I can't. I think I have to upgrade this.
[10069.61s -> 10081.30s]  I think I have to buy it or something. E. E. Cancel. Yeah I need to upgrade it. I'm using
[10081.30s -> 10097.99s]  this stream to de-stress. Nice. Hope you hope it works. Hope it's good. All right I don't know.
[10097.99s -> 10103.29s]  I don't know. I don't get it. I think it's because I have small crates and not large crates here.
[10103.29s -> 10111.94s]  This game was fun. This is a cool game. I like this game. This was cool. But now I'm gonna play
[10111.94s -> 10126.86s]  House of the Dead. This was fun. Oh my god. Jesus. Okay we're good. This was fun. I had a good time.
[10126.86s -> 10132.92s]  Played it for like three hours. That was fun. It was cool to hang out. Let's play House of the Dead.
[10132.92s -> 10142.38s]  I've been looking. I wanted to play that. It was a good time to play it. Jesus Christ. Is everything
[10142.38s -> 10148.82s]  gonna be all right? The stream might just get turned off. All right give me one sec.
