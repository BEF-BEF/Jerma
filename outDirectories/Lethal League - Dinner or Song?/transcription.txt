[5.18s -> 8.38s]  Alright. Are you ready to be introduced?
[8.38s -> 12.18s]  Yeah, I'm here. Do the drumroll first for me.
[12.18s -> 16.91s]  I want a drumroll. Hey! What is going on, buddy?
[16.91s -> 20.31s]  No, see, that's you introducing yourself. Only I want the drumroll.
[20.31s -> 29.29s]  Okay. Star! Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome to...
[29.29s -> 32.65s]  This is Lethal League, as you probably could tell. We're gonna do
[32.65s -> 37.11s]  round two on Lethal League, as both of us have had a chance to figure out how to play this
[37.11s -> 37.89s]  video game.
[38.21s -> 41.45s]  You haven't played this game. Yes, I have. Since the last video.
[41.45s -> 46.70s]  We played it in the hotel at PAX. You played like two games.
[46.70s -> 50.78s]  How do you know that I haven't been sitting around
[50.78s -> 55.64s]  practicing? Well, do you have the extra super skins?
[55.64s -> 60.16s]  What's that? Oh, he does!
[60.16s -> 66.14s]  Play ball. Play raw. Get destroyed.
[66.82s -> 71.18s]  Oh, I might have increased the ball speed, by the way. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[71.18s -> 74.82s]  What did you do? I increased the ball speed. Why did you do that?
[74.82s -> 77.74s]  Well, I'm not used to this increased ball speed.
[77.74s -> 82.70s]  I've never played like this. It's alright.
[82.70s -> 88.74s]  You think you could stop me? You can't stop anybody.
[88.74s -> 93.41s]  Yeah, well, you told me about the balls and how am I supposed to know?
[93.41s -> 98.49s]  This is going a lot better than the last time we played.
[98.49s -> 102.77s]  Yeah, this really... says the guy that increases ball speed.
[102.77s -> 105.93s]  Puts his balls in my face.
[105.93s -> 114.35s]  I was going to warn you, I guess.
[114.35s -> 118.63s]  There we go. You don't get away from this.
[118.63s -> 122.47s]  Shit! I tried to jump on you. I just got an achievement for that one.
[122.47s -> 126.35s]  Okay, well, I didn't. What are you doing? I was trying to
[126.35s -> 131.14s]  launch it back at you. Did you get an achievement for that one?
[131.78s -> 135.45s]  That thing's going to be so late.
[135.45s -> 139.99s]  You never know where I'm going. You've got to be shitting me.
[139.99s -> 145.82s]  You know what's really freaking me out? It's the fact that I'm blue.
[145.82s -> 150.91s]  There we go. You don't like being blue?
[150.91s -> 155.98s]  You're not going to catch this one. Wow, I didn't. My face, maybe.
[155.98s -> 158.82s]  Well, I'm still ahead. Sorry, not for long.
[158.82s -> 162.74s]  I guarantee you, I bet you $50 billion on this net.
[162.74s -> 166.58s]  No, I was talking. I bet you $50 billion you get hit by this.
[166.58s -> 169.72s]  Are you ready? Are you willing to make that bet?
[169.72s -> 176.19s]  Yes. I meant, like, right now...
[176.19s -> 182.70s]  50 billion! 50 billion! You can't just change the parameters.
[182.70s -> 187.80s]  That was a good warm-up.
[187.80s -> 189.80s]  Can you make that color adjustment in your brain?
[189.80s -> 192.68s]  I'm trying to make the adjustment in my brain.
[192.68s -> 199.25s]  But it's okay, because I'm playing the Candyman.
[199.25s -> 202.27s]  You're not going to fool me with that.
[202.31s -> 207.95s]  You ain't going to fool me. For some reason, just completely blanked.
[207.95s -> 213.83s]  What's going on? My controller just fucking broke.
[213.83s -> 217.23s]  Oh, yes! We're going to do that again?
[217.23s -> 223.52s]  We're going to try to do that again. We're going to try to do that again.
[223.52s -> 226.43s]  Oh, he doesn't know when I'm going to hit it.
[226.43s -> 232.96s]  You've got it way down there. This is where it's going to get interesting.
[232.96s -> 236.45s]  It's going to get really interesting here. No, you're just going to get hit.
[236.45s -> 244.78s]  Izzy! What the fuck happened to me?
[244.78s -> 246.38s]  I swear, it's going to get really interesting.
[246.38s -> 248.86s]  Oh, it is going to get interesting. I did, yeah.
[248.86s -> 252.42s]  Okay, well, now I've got to put my pants on.
[252.42s -> 256.78s]  You're not wearing pants right now? No.
[256.78s -> 260.48s]  Well, that's interesting, I guess.
[260.48s -> 266.16s]  You know, I will just keep hitting this, and...
[268.65s -> 270.97s]  You're hitting it just slightly over my head.
[270.97s -> 274.65s]  And it's messing everything up.
[274.65s -> 280.68s]  Well, why don't you try to handle this situation, you motherfucker?
[280.68s -> 288.03s]  You're too tall. Hey, I do have a height advantage, but it's not a big deal.
[288.03s -> 292.43s]  You ready for this massive comeback? You're not going to get a massive comeback.
[292.43s -> 295.20s]  What you are going to get is you're going to get...
[295.20s -> 298.44s]  You're going to... I was talking to you.
[298.44s -> 302.15s]  Well, you should have been playing. All right. Come here.
[302.15s -> 304.40s]  Come here. Come over here.
[304.40s -> 308.38s]  Mmm. Why would I do that?
[308.38s -> 313.72s]  I win! So, what is at stake right here?
[313.72s -> 317.94s]  What are you putting at stake? Don't hit the ball.
[317.94s -> 326.32s]  Don't touch that ball. I will hand cook, like personal chef make you dinner.
[326.32s -> 330.40s]  All right. I will come over and cook you a delicious meal.
[330.40s -> 332.76s]  Now, I'm going to come to your apartment.
[332.76s -> 335.60s]  I want you to make me dinner at your place.
[335.60s -> 339.68s]  Okay. And it's got to be good.
[339.68s -> 343.04s]  You thought you could really do that? Did you really think you were going to do that?
[343.04s -> 345.80s]  I think you knew that I was going to do that.
[345.80s -> 349.48s]  So, what happens if you win while I let you just fucking farm your special?
[349.48s -> 350.96s]  That sounds like a great idea.
[350.96s -> 354.08s]  Well, if I win, I don't know. You need to make something up.
[354.08s -> 356.00s]  All right. If you win... I think we're even now.
[356.00s -> 360.04s]  If you win, then I will write you a personal song.
[360.04s -> 366.56s]  Like with like instruments, it'll be like a legitimate like why Star is like so cool song.
[366.56s -> 367.96s]  Yeah. You okay?
[367.96s -> 369.44s]  Yeah, I'm down with that. All right.
[369.44s -> 373.68s]  Whoever wins this, this is the champion. This is the champion championship.
[373.68s -> 377.08s]  Let's go. I think you're getting a song out of me.
[377.08s -> 380.72s]  You're very sorely mistaken here.
[380.72s -> 382.60s]  Whoa, how did you hit that?
[382.60s -> 389.18s]  Tall. Totally. God. What?
[389.18s -> 392.66s]  It's those tall hits that are up above my head. You don't understand.
[392.66s -> 400.38s]  Damn it. I was trying to bounce it up, bounce it around.
[400.38s -> 402.90s]  No, you bounce it back down to Charlie Town.
[402.90s -> 407.36s]  This is the one. This is the one for me.
[407.36s -> 413.07s]  Why? Oh, god damn it.
[413.07s -> 418.43s]  Oh, I'm going to get that personal ballad by my little bar to Jeremy.
[418.43s -> 420.11s]  You're not getting it.
[420.11s -> 424.43s]  I'm getting a delicious dinner of my choosing.
[424.43s -> 428.83s]  I want a bib with my name on it.
[428.83s -> 431.11s]  All right. I didn't promise any bibs.
[431.11s -> 436.22s]  Time to sit up.
[436.22s -> 438.94s]  You see which way it's going? Do you see where it's going?
[438.94s -> 440.54s]  You're going to have a little. Why did I jump into it?
[440.54s -> 442.70s]  I don't know. What kind of decision making am I doing here?
[442.70s -> 446.24s]  That was a bad decision.
[446.24s -> 447.32s]  No, I didn't want to do that.
[447.32s -> 449.93s]  OK, I did want to do that, though.
[449.93s -> 452.45s]  OK, that was all right.
[452.45s -> 460.94s]  Why? Yes. What kind of again, the decision making here?
[460.98s -> 463.14s]  What do I want for dinner? Let's think.
[463.14s -> 468.13s]  Do I want am I going to want like am I going to want like onions in this meal?
[468.13s -> 469.37s]  Do you want some frogs?
[469.37s -> 471.97s]  What do you even like know how to cook, by the way?
[471.97s -> 475.09s]  Are you knocking like maybe like microwave, like macaroni and cheese or something?
[475.09s -> 478.13s]  Are you? No, I know how to cook.
[478.13s -> 479.85s]  I hate that stupid bullshit.
[479.85s -> 486.87s]  You can go back to kindergarten with that that that pansy ass candy ass.
[486.87s -> 491.63s]  Oh, well, this is a pretty close game.
[491.63s -> 493.35s]  This is getting close.
[493.35s -> 495.83s]  This is getting close. I'm getting scared.
[495.83s -> 503.50s]  I mean to come on now that don't.
[503.50s -> 505.10s]  I freaked out for no reason.
[505.10s -> 515.52s]  I was you turn your freak.
[515.52s -> 518.30s]  Holy shit. This is bad.
[518.30s -> 521.54s]  Oh, my God. What am I supposed to do about this?
[521.54s -> 522.78s]  Holy shit.
[528.01s -> 531.14s]  No, I let you get it.
[531.14s -> 533.02s]  No, no, get away.
[533.02s -> 534.02s]  I don't know.
[537.38s -> 540.74s]  No, no, I'm getting that song.
[540.74s -> 551.71s]  No, I'm shutting up.
[551.71s -> 553.71s]  You get a fucking song.
[555.15s -> 562.30s]  He shines in the sky, that twinkle in my eye.
[562.30s -> 575.42s]  He gives me what a perfect guy at any point in time or history.
[575.42s -> 579.14s]  Once it's done, when we're done, stars the man.
[579.14s -> 581.66s]  He's so cool. He's so nice.
[581.66s -> 584.22s]  Everything about him is now strife.
[584.22s -> 586.62s]  Who's that flying in the sky?
[586.62s -> 589.22s]  Star on a motorcycle made for the sky.
[589.22s -> 591.66s]  There he goes, flying in front of your face.
[591.66s -> 594.38s]  Home on a journey to outer space.
