[4.60s -> 8.09s]  Hi, my name is Mr. Traff.
[22.25s -> 28.42s]  The herd. Let's go. I can't. I'm like up to the elephant's ass.
[29.54s -> 30.90s]  You're going to change the view a lot.
[34.90s -> 36.74s]  Let's go find somebody to rough him up.
[36.74s -> 40.46s]  Let's go rough somebody up. Elephant style.
[40.46s -> 42.90s]  This guy. This guy.
[43.54s -> 51.08s]  Get him. We can't hit him.
[51.88s -> 55.08s]  We don't know where my body is. We got him.
[55.08s -> 55.72s]  All right, he's dead.
[55.72s -> 58.63s]  Can we eat the flesh just like elephant do?
[58.63s -> 59.51s]  Yes.
[59.51s -> 62.76s]  All right, you hear the one about the two elephants?
[74.15s -> 76.55s]  Get in. You're doing the dancing.
[76.55s -> 90.09s]  There are seriously no, I'd love to make a couple of jokes or something, but this is like,
[90.09s -> 92.33s]  there is nothing that can be said.
[94.12s -> 98.52s]  This elephant dance is just perfect. He just leaps over, taps his foot.
[101.16s -> 104.94s]  Hold on a second. What is this going to look like? Get on this bike.
[109.90s -> 112.54s]  It's like they dropped like a dead elephant on a bike.
[113.10s -> 114.70s]  All right, let's go.
[114.70s -> 116.14s]  His butt's so crutched up.
[116.14s -> 116.70s]  Let's go.
[117.50s -> 119.50s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. One more. I got to.
[120.38s -> 126.63s]  Oh, you're the giraffe now?
[128.47s -> 131.83s]  We're zoo pals. Zoo pals make eating fun.
[131.83s -> 132.95s]  Oh, zoo pals.
[135.19s -> 136.23s]  You just disappeared.
[137.90s -> 139.90s]  I love zoo pals. I love animal crackers.
[142.81s -> 145.37s]  The elephants didn't want anything to do with it.
[145.37s -> 146.17s]  What the fuck?
[152.14s -> 155.43s]  Okay. So, oh, look at this one coming down the street.
[157.99s -> 159.51s]  He's going pretty fast.
[164.09s -> 166.17s]  I wish he drove through this whole crowd.
[171.72s -> 173.16s]  Why are they such psychos?
[175.48s -> 177.53s]  Why aren't these elephants doing anything?
[177.53s -> 178.01s]  I don't know.
[178.57s -> 180.07s]  Oh, they'll be back.
[184.49s -> 185.77s]  No, no.
[186.65s -> 187.29s]  No, get in.
[195.34s -> 197.16s]  Later.
[197.16s -> 201.03s]  All right, I got this elephant.
[201.03s -> 202.15s]  I'm tracking down an elephant.
[202.79s -> 205.58s]  Elephant on a bike.
[206.14s -> 211.74s]  He's going pretty, pretty goddamn fast.
[214.98s -> 216.26s]  Here he goes. Do you see him?
[217.14s -> 218.98s]  Oh, you're getting to chase on the elephant.
[220.94s -> 222.14s]  Oh, I don't want to go that fast.
[224.12s -> 226.79s]  Wow. He really is.
[226.79s -> 228.71s]  He's flooring it.
[228.71s -> 230.71s]  How is he weaving out of traffic that well?
[232.33s -> 233.29s]  Probably not that well.
[234.42s -> 236.26s]  He's all right. He got back on track.
[238.10s -> 247.56s]  He just came out of the fence.
[248.28s -> 249.32s]  He's more interesting.
[249.32s -> 251.16s]  The elephant's gone now.
[251.16s -> 253.08s]  This guy's way more interesting.
[261.70s -> 262.82s]  Get him. Get him.
[262.82s -> 263.14s]  Kick his ass.
[263.14s -> 265.54s]  They all want this one truck.
[267.06s -> 268.10s]  Who's going to win?
[272.60s -> 274.44s]  They are all just fighting over the same car.
[274.44s -> 275.00s]  They really are.
[275.99s -> 277.11s]  There's other cars.
[277.11s -> 277.83s]  You idiots.
[279.61s -> 282.17s]  I'm trying to push it to get one of them out of here.
[283.85s -> 285.85s]  As soon as they get thrown out of the car, too,
[285.85s -> 288.09s]  it's like they don't want to drive anymore.
[288.09s -> 291.85s]  Yeah. Whoever's the last person that gets in
[291.85s -> 293.29s]  is the one that's driving.
[293.29s -> 294.68s]  Oh, maybe not.
[294.68s -> 295.16s]  I don't know.
[302.36s -> 303.48s]  One out of the herd.
[305.70s -> 307.54s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[309.06s -> 310.18s]  You dicks.
[311.14s -> 316.10s]  What is up with these psychos?
[347.42s -> 347.98s]  The winner.
[352.62s -> 353.90s]  Is your feet up the truck?
[354.94s -> 356.06s]  Oh, I'm passing out.
[356.06s -> 356.46s]  Hold on.
[356.46s -> 357.18s]  Get in.
[357.18s -> 357.90s]  I can't.
[357.90s -> 358.38s]  I can't breathe.
[358.38s -> 359.50s]  Get in.
[359.50s -> 359.98s]  I can't.
[360.86s -> 363.43s]  I'm so confused in the city.
[363.43s -> 364.63s]  Oh, that's a 10-4.
[379.10s -> 379.42s]  Bye.
[380.92s -> 381.64s]  Where are you going?
[382.52s -> 391.74s]  I'm just trying to find it.
[391.74s -> 392.70s]  Can you breathe?
[393.34s -> 399.19s]  I think my game broke.
[404.42s -> 405.62s]  Yeah, you didn't respond.
[406.42s -> 407.30s]  What was the movie?
[408.26s -> 409.30s]  Dumbo Drop?
[409.30s -> 410.42s]  What's the movie?
[410.42s -> 410.92s]  Quick.
[412.02s -> 414.02s]  What's the name of that fucking movie?
[414.02s -> 417.62s]  It's Dumbo Drop, Dumbo Drop and Disconnected.
