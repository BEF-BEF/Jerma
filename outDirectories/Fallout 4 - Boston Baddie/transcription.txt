[19.75s -> 31.31s]  War. War, yeah. War never changes today. War never changes. No, I don't.
[31.31s -> 33.55s]  Okay, skip.
[33.55s -> 39.05s]  Can you get that? It's probably that salesman. He comes for you every day.
[39.05s -> 46.46s]  Just got hit in the face by a broomstick, honey. Can you get the goddamn door?
[46.46s -> 51.41s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome to Federal Offense with German985.
[51.41s -> 55.58s]  What's that? We're gonna take this guy's mail? Federal off-
[55.58s -> 61.49s]  He doesn't have any mail. Hold on. We're gonna find a guy with a mail in his mailbox.
[61.49s -> 63.49s]  Oh, fuck it. We're really gonna town now. Who cares?
[66.73s -> 69.29s]  Huh? Oh shit. A raider.
[69.29s -> 80.88s]  Get him. Get him. Get him, boy.
[80.88s -> 85.85s]  Don't kick my dog, you fucking bitch.
[85.85s -> 88.92s]  See if he had anything worth taking.
[88.92s -> 99.46s]  We're looking for cash. We're looking for ammunition, supplies. Or you could take off all the guys clothes.
[99.46s -> 106.47s]  Easy with that thing, dude. Easy with that thing, dude.
[108.67s -> 115.73s]  Take a look at that, boy. Diamond City. It's a beautiful area. Wonderful people.

[118.73s -> 120.73s]  Looking for someone who's gone missing.
[120.73s -> 124.35s]  Gone missing? Who is he?
[124.35s -> 130.07s]  A baby boy. Kidnapped.
[130.07s -> 134.07s]  A baby boy? Really? I'm afraid.
[134.07s -> 144.23s]  I'm lost, pastor. I need help. Please.
[144.23s -> 150.84s]  Well, I don't want Nick Valentine.
[150.84s -> 152.84s]  Thanks. I'll go talk to him.
[152.84s -> 154.84s]  Take care of yourself now.
[154.84s -> 155.84s]  Piper, you're back.
[155.84s -> 160.90s]  Who's there? Gonna be a good fight.
[160.90s -> 165.23s]  Will you shut up?
[165.23s -> 170.23s]  Seriously, I'm trying to like sneak up on people and this guy's just screaming at them. Will you duck?
[170.23s -> 172.23s]  Wait, the hell?
[172.23s -> 175.66s]  You fucking idiot.
[175.66s -> 182.47s]  This is what happens when you scream.
[182.47s -> 189.29s]  When you scream about puny humans. When we're trying to be sneak attacking. What do you want me to do, dude?
[189.29s -> 192.87s]  Get cover.
[192.87s -> 193.87s]  Officer?
[193.87s -> 194.87s]  Nice hat.
[194.87s -> 196.18s]  You like my hat? Thanks.
[196.18s -> 200.18s]  Park the car in the yard? How about I hammer you in the heart with a haymaker?
[200.18s -> 201.18s]  Oh, Boston.
[201.18s -> 202.18s]  No funny business.
[202.18s -> 204.86s]  You're from Boston.
[204.86s -> 205.86s]  Get me out of here.
[205.86s -> 215.87s]  Our new arrival. I wish I was in your shoes. Getting to see our glorious city for the first time. How can I help you?
[215.87s -> 219.14s]  A man named Kellogg used to
[219.14s -> 225.78s]  Oh, what is that? I-95? Oh, that's a good fucking highway.
[225.78s -> 229.78s]  The history of Boston Common.
[229.78s -> 232.34s]  I'm interested in the history of this place.
[232.34s -> 245.67s]  Let us go back hundreds of years. It is the year 1775 or seven years.
[245.67s -> 260.54s]  Excuse me.
[260.54s -> 264.54s]  Gotta pick me up if you're feeling glum.
[264.54s -> 265.54s]  You got drugs?
[265.54s -> 266.54s]  Oh!
[266.54s -> 267.54s]  Did you say something about drugs?
[267.54s -> 270.54s]  That's right. All the chems you need to fill out your lifestyle.
[270.54s -> 271.54s]  Right.
[271.54s -> 272.54s]  Everyone here buys from-
[272.54s -> 275.54s]  Fuck you! How dare you sell drugs?
[275.54s -> 278.66s]  Uh, not now.
[278.66s -> 280.66s]  Cool. Cool.
[280.66s -> 281.66s]  You should think about getting a trim.
[281.66s -> 287.42s]  Yeah. Hey, can I have a sip of your Coca-Cola? Thanks.
[287.42s -> 289.10s]  Uh-huh.
[289.10s -> 295.72s]  Can I, uh, can I have a sip of your other Coca-Cola? Thanks.
[295.72s -> 301.42s]  You're using that umbrella. It might rain tomorrow. Thanks.
[301.42s -> 303.42s]  Don't be shy now.
[303.42s -> 308.23s]  Can I have the container that holds the umbrella, too? I don't think I have one.
[308.23s -> 315.10s]  Oh, thanks. Can I have the desk fan, too? Thanks.
[315.10s -> 319.50s]  Can I have all this stuff in your medicine cabinet? Thanks.
[319.50s -> 323.44s]  What about your safe? There's a lot of stuff in here, too.
[323.44s -> 324.44s]  Can I have-
[325.44s -> 326.44s]  This could be yours.
[326.44s -> 328.44s]  I'll put it back!
[328.44s -> 330.44s]  I'll put it back!
[330.44s -> 333.45s]  Just wait!
[333.45s -> 335.45s]  I'm gonna put it back!
