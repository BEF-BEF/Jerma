[2.62s -> 10.39s]  Good morning. What? Good afternoon is what I meant to say. How are you? Good afternoon or evening,
[10.39s -> 25.74s]  wherever you are in the world, how are you? Morning makes no sense. Today, we have an interesting
[25.74s -> 42.17s]  stream today. I decided to get Freddy Fish 3 and a search for the kelp diamond. Now this is green
[42.17s -> 49.53s]  screen movie night. Let's, I'm gonna wait because we need people to trickle in here. People have been
[49.53s -> 52.81s]  waiting for this for a while. So I want to make sure that I don't just go. Let's go. Hurry up.
[53.37s -> 62.28s]  Hopefully you have some something to snack on. Maybe I've heard some of you have made some popcorn.
[63.62s -> 73.74s]  Pretty cool. Maybe you've got a beverage. I've got a green tea. I was thinking about having a little
[73.74s -> 80.36s]  bit of alcohol tonight, but I think I might have to not do that because I'm sick. Still having
[80.36s -> 87.70s]  problems. Probably a bad idea. I thought about maybe just drinking like a couple of beers.
[88.42s -> 93.30s]  But it's probably not a good idea for how I am now. And how I am now, I'm still coughing. I'm
[93.30s -> 96.90s]  still having issues and you probably hear it from time to time, but I'm, I've been pretty good at
[96.90s -> 107.26s]  muting and muting the sneezes and shit too. So dude, come on. Aren't you like 20? I don't know why
[107.26s -> 119.50s]  anybody ever thinks this. No. Aren't you, aren't you 20? Okay. So here's what happened tonight.
[119.50s -> 123.90s]  If you don't know how good you're not, we've been hyping this up for like a month now.
[125.08s -> 130.50s]  This is green screen movie night. Over the course of the last two or three weeks,
[131.14s -> 138.34s]  we have had people submit videos using footage from the last three and a half to four years of
[138.34s -> 143.94s]  green screen footage. We recently, last month, or not last month, maybe three weeks ago, four weeks
[143.94s -> 149.70s]  ago, just about under a month, went in front of the green screen again. I did a bunch of weird shit
[150.73s -> 158.49s]  and there were almost a thousand submissions, almost 1000 submissions came through.
[159.13s -> 165.18s]  And I wanted to make a point of this because we, I got, I have to say this, right?
[167.30s -> 172.50s]  If your video is not shown, don't be discouraged. It's just, there was a lot to go through.
[174.30s -> 179.02s]  All the videos were vetted and put in, and we're going to do maybe two nights,
[179.02s -> 182.06s]  might be able to do three nights. So even if you don't see your video tonight,
[183.03s -> 186.87s]  that doesn't mean it was a bad video, right? That means that you might show it. It probably
[186.87s -> 191.03s]  will show up during an encore night, which I'm not even going to call it an encore night because
[192.15s -> 197.67s]  there are so many, so there are so many good submissions that we're just going to do this
[197.67s -> 204.25s]  twice. There's no way we're only going to do this once. It's physically impossible. Out of the,
[204.25s -> 214.84s]  I think, what were the total amount of submissions? Submissions? Submissions. Yeah. 800? 900? We'll,
[215.08s -> 221.50s]  we'll probably show at least a third of these or if not more, but I can't show them all, right?
[221.50s -> 225.10s]  Even if it's good, even if it's, it's going to be hard to show all of these.
[229.00s -> 232.12s]  So if you watch this tonight and you go, where the fuck is my video?
[233.00s -> 239.21s]  Um, don't because it could show up on the next one. And if it doesn't show up on the next one,
[240.30s -> 245.70s]  then don't be discouraged, please. It was just a lot to go through. And we had to just select
[246.42s -> 252.90s]  ones based on how much effort went into this one or who thought, all the mods and community leaders,
[252.90s -> 257.11s]  did they think this one was funny? Cause I didn't, I haven't seen any of these. I have not seen a
[257.11s -> 260.31s]  single one of these. That's a lie. I'm lying to you right now. I've seen probably four,
[261.66s -> 273.21s]  but that's what I need to say. That's what I need to say. I'm a liar. Well, I'm very excited. We have
[273.21s -> 280.62s]  how many videos are there? Let's see. Uh, there are, there are one, there are almost 200 videos
[280.62s -> 286.14s]  as of right now, still cleaning the playlist up a little bit. The 198 videos on this playlist.
[286.14s -> 293.72s]  Are you fucking kidding me? I hopefully can get through this in the next four to five hours.
[296.30s -> 305.67s]  So we'll find out. Yeah. The consideration for videos that we're going to be shown were how
[305.67s -> 313.64s]  much will chat like this? How much will I like this? I'm, I'm hyping this up. We're hyping this
[313.64s -> 320.95s]  up. I'm not just going to go guys. 300 million people have been waiting for this stream.
[323.29s -> 333.06s]  Divide that by like a thousand or 2000 or whatever, or 10,000. I'm it's been a long time since we've
[333.06s -> 340.95s]  watched any of these. Are you guys ready? It's been about the, I should wait for about 10 minutes.
[342.09s -> 345.93s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let me wait for 10 minutes. Did I tweet?
[346.57s -> 358.52s]  Did I tweet? I did. Right. Just making sure I tweeted. Oh yeah, I did. Oh yeah. Hey, hey,
[358.52s -> 367.32s]  you guys, you guys ready to laugh? You guys ready to laugh it up? Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[367.32s -> 382.66s]  All right. All right. Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, wait.
[385.70s -> 392.18s]  Sorry. Also the audio on these, we did make a rule where you couldn't have abrupt loud sounds,
[392.18s -> 396.34s]  but none of this stuff is equalized. So just be aware that some stuff might, some videos might be
[396.34s -> 402.50s]  way louder than others. Some videos might be at a certain decibel level. I have a limiter that I
[402.50s -> 407.38s]  can turn on. So if it gets to be too crazy, then we'll, I'll turn it on, but I don't think I'm going
[407.38s -> 419.08s]  to need to as of right now. Okay. We're just going in full blast. Yeah. So it's probably going to be
[419.08s -> 426.38s]  loud. Some of these and some have jump scares, by the way. Some of these have, they do. All right.
[426.38s -> 430.62s]  Some of them have jump scares. Okay. Thanks for the warning. Cause I, some of them have jump
[430.62s -> 438.06s]  scares. Be ready for jump scares too. All right. I'm not waiting anymore. Adjust your volume as,
[438.06s -> 448.55s]  as you see fit because it's going to, it's going to get loud here. Here we go. It's w we, we are T
[448.55s -> 453.91s]  minus two minutes away. Also be ready to dance too. Be ready to dance is what I've been told.
[454.47s -> 463.40s]  Remember, why do you hate EU fans? I wanted to like drink like three drinks of vodka tonight
[463.40s -> 466.92s]  to this stream. And I'm not drinking at fucking 10 o'clock in the morning. Okay.
[469.43s -> 473.91s]  But I might have to have to cancel my drinking tonight. We'll see. After like an hour,
[473.91s -> 481.83s]  we'll see how I feel. Refresh. Yeah. I did. I got it. You're a coward. No, I'm ill.
[483.38s -> 497.93s]  I'm physically ill. That did sound fake and it may have been. Okay. That was very loud.
[497.93s -> 507.56s]  That was a good test. That's a good test of the, of the, uh, the sound system. I'm so excited.
[510.18s -> 519.56s]  I'm so excited and I just can't hide it. I know, I know, I know, I don't, don't, don't,
[519.56s -> 525.32s]  whatever it is. I, I'm not waiting anymore. We're almost at the 10 minute mark and everyone's
[525.32s -> 530.04s]  already here. Everybody's here. Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Ladies and gentlemen,
[530.04s -> 536.86s]  welcome to green screen movie night. The final of maybe two or three green screen movie nights.
[536.86s -> 546.98s]  Got to do it in a trilogy. That's how it works here. Here we go. I'm ready. Are you ready?
[547.06s -> 562.68s]  Oh my goodness. Begin. Hi. Oh, here are your friends. Oh, it's Otto.
[564.86s -> 606.98s]  Well, this is the fucking. Okay. I'm going to shut up. Hey, Dr. Spikes. It is awesome. Oh,
[606.98s -> 617.69s]  all right. Cool. That was cute. From all of us, banana bros. All right. That was cute.
[617.69s -> 652.17s]  That's a good intro. Let's move. The middle one's not even a twerk.
[681.80s -> 703.38s]  37 years old. I don't join. That was an original song, by the way, if you were curious,
[703.38s -> 742.15s]  it's called German's new friend. Oh shit. Please clap. Hi.
[761.99s -> 766.55s]  Don't splash me. Don't splash me. You can't splash here. It says it on the sign.
[767.11s -> 775.08s]  We walked in. Don't splash people. That was it. That was 3D animated. Hold on a second.
[775.08s -> 785.45s]  That was. Hold on. This was 3D animated. It's probably took like a week to render.
[790.74s -> 795.22s]  Don't splash me. Don't splash me. I love it here. It says it on the sign.
[796.82s -> 804.12s]  Don't splash people. All right. What's coming up next? That was so good.
[804.92s -> 837.32s]  German remix 10, part one, unlisted. Oh shit. The same person made them before, right?
[853.32s -> 937.30s]  Come on. Oh shit. I get it. This is awesome. Damn. Holy shit.
[954.54s -> 1034.15s]  One, two, three, go. Oh Jesus. Holy shit. That was a pogchamp right there. Wow. Wow. That was sick.
[1038.44s -> 1042.46s]  We'll give the playlist at the end of the stream and everything too, so don't worry.
[1042.46s -> 1047.98s]  Wow. Pretty good start. Pretty good start so far. No cam. I'm not going to put a cam on,
[1047.98s -> 1053.06s]  by the way. People have asked for it. I don't want to mess with the integrity of the video files.
[1053.06s -> 1057.78s]  I think it's better that way. So we can get engrossed. You don't have to look at my
[1057.78s -> 1065.69s]  fucking ugly mug in the corner. I might pop in from time to time. You never know. By the way,
[1065.69s -> 1077.78s]  people are like, oh wow. Hooray. Good. That's it. There's 192 more videos. So sit down and strap in.
[1077.78s -> 1099.16s]  The sus experience. Don't let them see you. Find the exit. Don't die. Status hidden. This is a
[1099.16s -> 1148.33s]  whole game. Warning. Jumpscare coming. Heartbeat.
[1222.58s -> 1258.46s]  The soft part. I want to see the soft part again. Nice job. Oh, no shit. What? Dr. Clay.
[1259.51s -> 1267.99s]  No shit. Dr. Clay's a mod here. You don't know. This part is so dumb. I need to see this again.
[1267.99s -> 1290.60s]  The best part about that is when the gas hits. That's when the bicycle falls apart. That's
[1290.60s -> 1297.16s]  perfect. Well done. Well done. Well done. Oh, my God. That was funny. All right. Let's keep
[1297.16s -> 1302.89s]  moving. We don't stop. We got to keep going. No stopping. Be careful. Things could be loud.
[1302.89s -> 1334.38s]  I'm just warning you. The battle of Home Depot 2. Oh, God. What? Sire, get down.
[1335.02s -> 1344.01s]  I've been a Jedi agent the whole time. Get down, Sire. I have the power of God and anime on my side.
[1347.11s -> 1351.91s]  Oh, God. It's fucking Spider-Man. Why would Spider-Man be in this game?
[1356.70s -> 1373.24s]  Let's go. You shall not pass. Yeah, that's right. Gandalf. Always pick Gandalf.
[1379.98s -> 1397.74s]  Oh, my God. Oh, shoot. It was a Boomerang. Boomerang mode. Don't use that one.
[1407.16s -> 1412.97s]  Ow. No. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[1419.32s -> 1424.68s]  Now, I think, honestly, look, I'm going to work. I'm on the way to work right now.
[1425.64s -> 1433.32s]  We can we can talk this later, but I want you to buy any company that that makes makes
[1434.44s -> 1440.41s]  what the hell are they called? Tick-tock. You buy tick-tock. How do you buy that?
[1443.53s -> 1464.84s]  I can't. What? How did you do this? Seize towers. Topple them.
[1464.84s -> 1485.13s]  Wait a second. Wait a second. I I just hold on this. There was a lot to there was a lot to take
[1485.13s -> 1492.57s]  in on this one. This was it was a lot to take in here. This is my favorite part of the whole thing
[1493.83s -> 1501.46s]  is the fact that you put it in. Did you put a cheat code in to get a lightsaber or is it to
[1501.46s -> 1509.05s]  unlock? Oh, it's to unlock the jester. OK, sorry. I get down. I've been a Jedi agent the whole time.
[1509.05s -> 1516.65s]  God, that's so fucking dumb. That's so funny. Brilliant. All right. Moving on to the first of,
[1516.65s -> 1533.13s]  I would say, probably at least 20 Super Mario drug PSAs. That was amazing. My voice is going to be
[1533.13s -> 1547.08s]  gone. I'll deal with you later. Oh, boys and girls, it's a me, Mario. Let me tell you something.
[1547.80s -> 1555.64s]  If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no. You say, Luigi, try to drink
[1555.64s -> 1563.58s]  and do drugs one time. And I said, no. And he said, Mario. And I said, no, you should never take any
[1563.58s -> 1574.33s]  drugs. Never. Mario wouldn't. Luigi wouldn't. Toad. Maybe. What the fuck? Don't do drugs.
[1574.89s -> 1582.66s]  If you do drugs, you'll end up like King Bowser. Boys and girls, don't do drugs. You don't have to
[1582.66s -> 1588.58s]  do them. Don't feel pressured to take drugs or drink. If anyone ever pressures you, tell them,
[1588.58s -> 1592.58s]  Mario said, so long, King Bowser, and they will leave you alone.
[1594.62s -> 1604.57s]  This is called Germstraction Do's How Bees Make Honey. This is Crash Box.
[1604.57s -> 1620.07s]  Distraction with your anchor person, Dora Smarmy. Good evening. I'm Dora Smarmy,
[1620.07s -> 1625.19s]  and welcome to Distraction News, where we give you the news and then ask you questions about
[1625.19s -> 1630.79s]  what we've just reported. So make sure you're not distracted. Pay attention. Now for our top story
[1630.79s -> 1638.23s]  today, how bees make honey. The female worker bee flies from the hive to a flower. When she arrives,
[1638.23s -> 1644.23s]  she climbs in and using her hollow straw-like tongue, she drinks the nectar. The nectar enters
[1644.23s -> 1650.63s]  the bee's crop or honey stump. She mixes it with important proteins called enzymes, which keep the
[1650.63s -> 1656.47s]  nectar fresh. When she is fully loaded with nectar, she returns to the hive where she pours out the
[1656.47s -> 1663.59s]  enzyme-rich nectar into a small waxed cell. We call these wax cells the honeycomb. Because the
[1663.59s -> 1669.43s]  hives are warm, a constant 95 degrees Fahrenheit, the water heats up in the nectar and evaporates.
[1669.43s -> 1675.75s]  What we're left with is sweet honey. Okay, now let's see how well you were able to remember the
[1675.75s -> 1681.27s]  facts and be sure to count how many you got right. Where does the worker bee get the nectar? From a
[1681.27s -> 1689.11s]  flower, the fridge, or rotten fruit? I don't know. The answer is a flower. In the honey stomach,
[1689.11s -> 1696.17s]  the nectar is mixed with proteins called bee juice, honey mix, or enzymes. The answer is
[1697.05s -> 1710.42s]  enzymes. And finally, bees wax, pollen, or water. The answer is water. So how did you do? Honey was
[1710.42s -> 1716.82s]  a pretty sticky topic, eh? Okay, so I'm a cardboard anchor and not a cardboard comedian. So sue me.
[1717.46s -> 1721.94s]  Well, that's all the time we have for today. But remember, don't ever let anything distract you
[1721.94s -> 1729.94s]  from watching distraction news. So long. This has been distraction news with your favorite
[1730.18s -> 1735.06s]  cardboard anchor person, Toro Smurmy.
[1747.78s -> 1754.33s]  Oh no, it's another Mario drug PSA. Hold on, hold on, we gotta go back. Oh my goodness,
[1754.33s -> 1761.54s]  this man got his son stolen by Super Mario. Okay, okay, let's check it out.
[1774.98s -> 1784.58s]  Bingo. This is in, look at how huge this is. Like, what is even in this?
[1794.04s -> 1797.64s]  What's that? No, no. You're doing a great job out there, son.
[1799.98s -> 1805.98s]  Don't climb that. Don't get down from there. Don't climb that. How do you mind? Don't climb that.
[1807.66s -> 1814.78s]  He's a maniac, I know, right? He's my son, right? Yeah, I know. You want, you ready for a dog?
[1815.26s -> 1832.38s]  Oh, I come into your house. You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't.
[1832.94s -> 1836.86s]  You're just a mean guy that got a bunch of TV shows and I'm not going to stand for it.
[1837.50s -> 1847.69s]  I'm not leaving. No, I think I deserve to win. What? It was a creepy mushroom risotto and you
[1847.69s -> 1856.62s]  don't have a fucking palate to save your life, you fucking idiot. Oh no. Sorry, I kept you all
[1856.62s -> 1867.66s]  waiting. They'd be running circles around you, by the way. Oh, what a terrible. Stop sign, stop
[1867.66s -> 1902.14s]  sign, stop sign. I'm going to use your wand. I might as well suggest you use it. No bluffing
[1902.14s -> 1909.67s]  this time, Harry. No bluffing. Last final touch, I swear I will not touch it again. Oh, beautiful.
[1910.63s -> 1916.89s]  Oh, that looks good, don't you think? You don't like, you didn't like my arm?
[1919.94s -> 1929.43s]  It's masterpiece, no? No? It's masterpiece, no? You know nothing about art.
[1934.18s -> 1947.48s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Let me get a little closer. They're going to hear literally every
[1947.48s -> 1952.84s]  single one of these words. That one was crazy. That one was amazing too.
[1954.01s -> 1961.21s]  Oh, okay, we got Jerma attempts the Mario 64 any percent 16 star, but I can't wait for this one.
[1961.21s -> 1971.82s]  They're going to hear literally every single one of these burps. No, toast goes in the toaster.
[1971.82s -> 1980.54s]  Is that in the same thing? Is that in that? All right, let's get some walking.
[2005.27s -> 2015.86s]  Where is he?
[2051.42s -> 2056.50s]  Oh, mama me.
[2076.74s -> 2090.36s]  I'm running out of time. I saw you laughing in the corner. What's wrong? What's wrong with me?
[2104.39s -> 2117.40s]  When did I put that fucking wig on? I don't even remember that. Honest to God.
[2118.28s -> 2119.80s]  Mario? What?
[2150.54s -> 2154.50s]  Hold on, I need a moment. They're going to hear literally every single one of these burps.
[2155.14s -> 2162.23s]  I'm so confused. What's with the hair? Who is it? My mind from this one. What is this?
[2164.25s -> 2174.02s]  Why? What is this from? Why did I think this was a good idea from Mario? It was his real hair.
[2174.76s -> 2182.57s]  Oh, you were being a farmer. Oh, because of the overalls. Right, right, right.
[2182.57s -> 2189.03s]  Right, so you just, okay, that's really funny. This is, man, that's a fucking 10 out of 10s.
[2189.03s -> 2197.40s]  Honest to God. God, that was so funny. All right, let's keep going. Here we go.
[2247.16s -> 2250.60s]  Get it. What is it on my back? What's on my back, dude? Get it. Just get it. I'll stand still.
[2250.60s -> 2256.79s]  Just hit it with that. I'll hit it with a baseball bat. I don't care. All right, you cartoon monster.
[2266.94s -> 2295.59s]  Ah, hmm, hmm, uh-uh, uh-uh. That hurts a little. That's supposed to feel like that.
[2296.23s -> 2305.88s]  It feels, my whole face hurts. My face is burning. That burns a lot. What the? What is that?
[2305.88s -> 2349.88s]  Oh, my God. That was fucking wonderful. Jerma makes his musical debut. It's so scary.
[2382.82s -> 2407.45s]  It's so unhinged. No, sit down. Sit down. Don't reach that. All right, okay, you gotta stand.
[2408.17s -> 2417.08s]  Thank you. Wow. Thank you. You don't have to stand. Sit down. Sit down. No, sit down. All right. Okay,
[2417.08s -> 2482.12s]  thank you. Thank you. I'm probably so red. I'm like hot. That was awesome. Good work.
[2484.07s -> 2494.14s]  New cowboy western ass of steel. You look like you just got out of jail. What the hell is this?
[2494.14s -> 2541.46s]  Should have been more careful. You're welcome. You're very welcome. But okay, my very part of
[2541.70s -> 2546.68s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, spoilers. What happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2546.68s -> 2551.45s]  what happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What'd I do? What'd I do? What'd I do?
[2551.45s -> 2557.42s]  Okay, we're good. My favorite part about this one is me going to pick up the gun.
[2558.55s -> 2572.89s]  This is the best part of the whole thing. What the fuck are you doing? Turn around. Let's go.
[2576.07s -> 2613.96s]  You're aware. What? Episode one. Here it comes.
[2672.49s -> 2703.40s]  I can't believe that happened. Oh, God. How did you pitch it up?
[2703.88s -> 2790.33s]  I'm going to put you in a meat grinder. Got him. Let's see where it goes from here. But yeah,
[2790.33s -> 2796.14s]  thanks again for watching. See you all next time. Take care everybody. That was cute.
[2796.14s -> 2805.34s]  This is German Lord of the Rings. You are not passing anytime soon buster.
[2806.44s -> 2813.40s]  You shall not pass.
[2829.34s -> 2835.35s]  Why did you turn off all the audio? All the audio turns off.
[2844.42s -> 2848.66s]  Oh, that's fucking funny. First Gandalf. Well, actually, no, we've seen two Gandalfs.
[2850.26s -> 2857.06s]  That's how it happens in the movie. Well, copyright. Let's go over copyright real quick.
[2857.94s -> 2862.82s]  One of the things we want to make sure is that we add a very, very transformative material.
[2863.69s -> 2870.12s]  These are obviously parodies and satires of these movies. Trying to get as close to
[2870.12s -> 2876.73s]  fair use as we can, obviously. Very, very transformed media. This is not a typical
[2876.73s -> 2885.24s]  Lord of the Rings. This is called German Noir, Murder on 985 Street.
[2908.70s -> 2922.28s]  Hey, hey, what's up, man? How are you? Yeah, I got a pot coming for you right here.
[2927.06s -> 2934.20s]  And it's drinking or smoking. Tell them with the hardest of hearts. No, I don't need to do that.
[2935.08s -> 2950.33s]  I don't care. Freshly brewed. There it is. Put your cup up. There it is. Give me your honest
[2950.33s -> 2960.18s]  opinion. I want to know the real deal. Tasty, isn't it? That hurts a little. Very good. Yeah,
[2960.18s -> 3002.62s]  it's very good. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, shit. You got me. Wait, how was it? What? What the
[3002.62s -> 3032.04s]  fuck? What that? What was that? What was that? What was that? I'm gonna lie down. Oh, no.
[3036.68s -> 3056.89s]  Right through the birch bees. That was awesome. Wait, what? What was it? Thanks to Jerma for
[3056.89s -> 3062.09s]  providing all the mocap, even though he ripped the suit like 16 times and ate all the wires
[3062.09s -> 3067.83s]  like spaghetti. That cannot be confirmed. You don't have any evidence that that actually happened.
[3067.83s -> 3080.28s]  Oh, man. That's funny. That was great. Glue man appearance. Jerma is a wizard. I knew there's
[3080.28s -> 3087.16s]  gonna be a shitload of these. Well, class, it's been a pleasure. Absolute pleasure. But you all.
[3087.16s -> 3094.68s]  Oh, my God. Understand the power of the Dark Lord. And for that reason, I'm out. Just like that show.
[3094.68s -> 3111.78s]  Shut up. Holy shit. What the fuck? What the fuck? Jerma had an exhibition. What the hell? That was
[3111.78s -> 3188.82s]  so fast. What the hell is going on here? Oh, come on. I can't. Dante and Virgil.
[3189.86s -> 3196.86s]  Okay, I gotta ask a question. Do you want to hear my laughs over all these? Or should I just mute?
[3196.86s -> 3205.35s]  I don't want to ruin these because these are so goddamn funny. No, we want to hear it. We want
[3205.43s -> 3215.88s]  to hear. Okay. All right. I'll keep it on. That was Jerma's at an exhibition.
[3223.53s -> 3228.09s]  Jerma 95 green screen rare VHS recording. Jeremy Albertson as Mario. What the fuck? Wait,
[3228.09s -> 3270.68s]  hold on. We gotta start this over. This actually has- I'm Jeremy Albertson,
[3270.68s -> 3277.43s]  aka the actor of Super Mario. But you know what's not Yahoo and what's not cool? Drugs and alcohol.
[3278.36s -> 3285.77s]  If somebody pressures you into smoking or drinking, tell them no. And you can tell them so long.
[3286.65s -> 3292.68s]  So long, King Bowser. Take it from me. Have a pretty cool life, don't you think?
[3298.97s -> 3305.53s]  Swing your arms from side to side. Come on and everyone go do the Mario. Swing your arms
[3305.53s -> 3313.03s]  from side to side. Come on, let's go. Let's do the Mario. Is that the Mario for you?
[3313.91s -> 3346.55s]  Yahoo that one. Oh my God. Jerma in the middle. Fuck on his head. Is that the bus?
[3346.55s -> 3349.51s]  Why did you miss it? That's not the bus.
[3349.51s -> 3355.13s]  Ah, idiot. Okay, let me see the car. I can do it.
[3355.13s -> 3361.61s]  How are we doing? How are we? Okay. Easy on the gas. Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3363.05s -> 3370.57s]  You screwed that up. I'm not scared. You bumped his balls. Hey, that's crazy.
[3371.61s -> 3377.06s]  You're pretty dumb. I'm not scared at all. You're dumb. You're not good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3377.86s -> 3380.74s]  You're very clear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[3388.81s -> 3411.37s]  All right, that's enough. Oh my God. Mean mustache guy. Mean mustache guy. I gotta say that hurts.
[3412.01s -> 3418.36s]  I think that's very fair. I think everything I said was, you know, I was very angry at certain
[3418.36s -> 3423.96s]  things. This can't be right. Hey, I don't want to be that. I'm not the angry mustache guy.
[3425.48s -> 3433.80s]  My name is Sean, okay. I don't get it. That's what you can call me. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
[3433.80s -> 3437.32s]  And let me tell you something about Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights
[3437.32s -> 3440.76s]  at So Do I? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I hear. I'm here to fight for you. Shut up.
[3441.56s -> 3450.01s]  Shut up. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're all stupid idiots.
[3451.77s -> 3460.06s]  You're dumb. You're the dumbest one here. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Turn that off. Turn that off. I'm
[3460.06s -> 3465.90s]  ashamed, Sean. I got, I got buns. I got ketchup. I got mustard. This relish right here too. Please do.
[3467.10s -> 3471.74s]  I've got a creamy cheddar risotto. Whose kid is this? Creamy chocolate risotto. And I also
[3472.22s -> 3473.02s]  He's going to Harvard.
[3479.02s -> 3487.02s]  Gravy, potatoes, meat, cheese, onions, tomatoes, peppers. Yes. Oh, I had a long day at work.
[3487.66s -> 3494.46s]  Let's go. Tasty, isn't it? Very good. That hurts. I'm dying. It's going to kill me.
[3495.34s -> 3501.66s]  Holy shit. Steven. That was so fucking crazy. I don't even know where to start with this
[3501.66s -> 3511.67s]  one. Jesus. This whole thing was just nonstop. It just never stopped. It never turned off.
[3519.67s -> 3525.53s]  My favorite part. Let me just go over my favorite part. First of all, it's, where is it?
[3525.53s -> 3527.45s]  Right here. When we get in the first car accident.
[3527.61s -> 3537.78s]  So you screwed that up. Of course he did. He's got a clipboard. Oh, caveman. And they're hitting him with the
[3537.78s -> 3542.15s]  I don't want to be that. I'm not. Yeah. And the principal talking about, I don't want to be the
[3542.15s -> 3547.67s]  one of my favorite things about doing the green screen stuff, honest to God is when people take
[3547.67s -> 3553.08s]  shit out of context and use it somewhere completely different and have it make total sense. Oh man,
[3553.16s -> 3556.76s]  different and have it make total sense. Oh man, that was good.
[3559.61s -> 3560.25s]  My name is
[3562.89s -> 3568.73s]  okay. Don't get it. That's what you can call me. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman. Oh my goodness gracious.
[3569.93s -> 3578.38s]  Oh my God. Whose kid is this? That's a double clap for me. That's clap, clap, clap. All right.
[3578.38s -> 3586.52s]  This next one is, I haven't seen this movie. So I don't, is this from the movie? I don't
[3586.52s -> 3593.43s]  know. This is from the trailer. I have no idea. But, um, this is apparently, um, I'm, this is the
[3593.43s -> 3611.35s]  audience reaction to this. Who cares? Well, I mean, I do. It's not a spoiler. What, what do you want?
[3611.35s -> 3616.23s]  Is this somebody who records in the theater? Stephen Strange. Wait, wait, hold on. You are now
[3616.23s -> 3624.58s]  called before the Illuminati. Our first member, Saul Goodman. Hi, I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know
[3624.58s -> 3633.59s]  that you have rights? It's warm. It's warm and time.
[3644.84s -> 3648.68s]  And finally, the most iconic streamer alive. German. I need five.
[3649.00s -> 3656.52s]  Yeah. German lied about TF2. What did I do? This is terrible. Nothing about this is good.
[3661.69s -> 3672.47s]  What is going on? Okay. Yes.
[3675.18s -> 3677.10s]  Oh, I'm going to get chucked up.
[3695.64s -> 3702.66s]  All your days are belong to us.
[3703.32s -> 3725.59s]  Oh, my God.
[3735.18s -> 3739.58s]  V6 engine. What do you got back here? Not as good as mine. He's dangerous.
[3739.58s -> 3778.34s]  This is so strong. I chopped you up in a meat grinder. The only thing that comes out is your
[3778.34s -> 3780.50s]  eyeball. You're probably dead.
[3800.70s -> 3802.94s]  In moderation, if you're old enough and you can be careful with it.
[3803.58s -> 3806.38s]  Alcohol, if you're old enough, be careful with it. Do you don't need to do anything else?
[3807.10s -> 3809.66s]  God, that was fucking crazy. We're going to be watching some more infomercials.
[3811.77s -> 3815.61s]  All right. This is long lost real men of genius Bud Light advertisement.
[3820.89s -> 3829.11s]  There's been some crazy ones. Hey, let's go. I have a bunch of queued up here.
[3830.20s -> 3833.96s]  First one seems very, very interesting. And I'm very curious how it plays out.
[3839.27s -> 3848.15s]  Non-specific alcohol brand presents real germas of genius. Real germas of genius.
[3849.11s -> 3852.87s]  Today, we salute you, Mr. Clinically Insane Green Screen E-Clown.
[3852.87s -> 3858.55s]  Mr. Clinically Insane Green Screen E-Clown. You could play video games like a normal streamer,
[3858.55s -> 3864.23s]  yet you let your unhinged mania take the wheel and twerk in a dollar store crown to an audience
[3864.23s -> 3871.27s]  of 20,000. 20K Andy. Your community. Hey, 35K Andy now. Not to share your horrifying
[3871.27s -> 3877.91s]  tales of everyday life, but you do it anyway. This guy is insane. Some may ask,
[3877.91s -> 3886.15s]  there's no way this guy's real, but unfortunately you are. This is a cry for hell. So crack open
[3886.15s -> 3891.91s]  an ice cold red wine, oh, King of the jungle, because your reign of terror won't last forever.
[3892.79s -> 3901.50s]  Mr. Clinically Insane Green Screen E-Clown. That hurts a little. That's supposed to feel like that.
[3904.70s -> 3908.62s]  Jerma joins the Cruelty Squad. All right, I've never played Cruelty Squad, by the way.
[3911.64s -> 3917.34s]  Oh, these are fucking great. If you've never played Cruelty Squad, whatever the name of this
[3917.34s -> 3922.26s]  game is, if you've never played Cruelty Squad, be careful. This might be a spoiler. And I think
[3922.26s -> 3925.46s]  the game has flashing lights, so be careful. Okay, three, two, one, let's go.
[3925.46s -> 4011.54s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, okay, hold on. Jerma auditions to replace Jerma.
[4017.62s -> 4019.54s]  What do you got for us coming out here? All right.
[4024.42s -> 4028.58s]  So you're going to do a routine with the nunchucks and okay. Yeah, for sure. Number 13, whenever
[4028.58s -> 4041.88s]  you're ready. All right. That was a tease, but that was good. That was very good. Wow. Well,
[4041.88s -> 4044.84s]  that's interesting because if you think that you have what it takes to be me,
[4045.48s -> 4049.72s]  then you need to have what it takes to beat me. Because you're going against the master now.
[4058.60s -> 4059.48s]  This is incredible.
[4070.17s -> 4073.05s]  Okay, you want to fucking go? Hey, Jerma985 here.
[4073.85s -> 4083.11s]  Jerma, real Jerma. Real Jerma. Let's get this imposter out of here.
[4083.11s -> 4087.99s]  Hey, in case they don't see him. Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
[4090.65s -> 4095.61s]  Oh, by the way, I think it's a good time to bring this up. So somebody had a submission
[4095.61s -> 4101.06s]  to green screen movie night and they were like, oh, is this okay? And we were like, oh, yeah.
[4101.06s -> 4108.50s]  I was contacted by one of the mods that said, hey, so somebody made this green screen edit.
[4108.50s -> 4116.06s]  It's way longer than three minutes. It's in fact, the entire movie, The Truman Show,
[4116.06s -> 4121.70s]  the whole runtime of the entire film, but you are replaced in every single scene.
[4121.70s -> 4130.50s]  And it's like, well, no, we can't do that. First of all. First of all, I can't do that. And second
[4130.50s -> 4141.10s]  of all, why? Why the whole movie? My favorite part about it, though, is there was a back and forth
[4141.10s -> 4145.42s]  where it was just like, hey, it's just like, I mean, I kind of went a little overboard
[4145.42s -> 4155.98s]  or something, right? It's like, yeah, it's the whole movie, dude. I don't want to talk.
[4155.98s -> 4162.57s]  Obviously, I cannot show an entire movie here, right? But that's all I'm going to say.
[4162.57s -> 4172.76s]  That's hilarious. It's absolutely hilarious. Let me just take one second. I got to make sure
[4172.76s -> 4181.06s]  that we have the right amount of movies left. I can confirm. Yes, Grump is DMing me. That is
[4181.06s -> 4191.61s]  correct. Correct number of videos. Oh, man. But that's so funny. OK, so here we go.
[4191.61s -> 4207.99s]  Jerma Psychotic Adventures in the Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Here we go. Oh, Oblivion. OK, let's start.
[4248.31s -> 4252.39s]  You are the one from my dreams. I've never played Oblivion. I don't know how this works.
[4253.75s -> 4262.25s]  I've never played one minute of Oblivion. Then the stars were right. This is the day. Gods give me
[4262.25s -> 4297.19s]  strength. Take me like three times. I'm crazy or not, right? This is two left hands.
[4297.91s -> 4315.64s]  Die, you motherfucker. Stop. What do you do? Stop criminal scum, right? Stop right there,
[4315.64s -> 4322.36s]  criminal scum. Is it stop criminal scum? Stop. You violated the law. Stop you violated. OK,
[4322.36s -> 4329.08s]  you violated the law. Stop right there, criminal scum. Stop criminal scum. You violated the law.
[4329.08s -> 4336.60s]  You violated the law. Now pay your fine or it's off to jail. You will pay in blood. Then pay with
[4336.60s -> 4353.22s]  your blood. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. What little patience I have is wearing thin. Stop. Stop. I
[4353.22s -> 4367.66s]  have no time for mindless blather. Oh, looks like you are in some trouble. Don't worry. I'll look
[4367.66s -> 4377.11s]  the other way and take care of that fine for you. Stop. Now that you've given us a taste,
[4377.19s -> 4381.51s]  you're going to lose this group. All this Gregor's want more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[4381.51s -> 4391.48s]  That's what I hear. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Stupid. You're all
[4391.48s -> 4401.29s]  stupid idiots. You're dumb. You're the dumbest one here. Yeah. Now get to turn that off.
[4401.93s -> 4415.42s]  Sachet away. You're the driving instructor. Hold on. This is a real one. This one's filmed in real
[4415.42s -> 4426.23s]  life, by the way. We got another real one. You're the driving instructor. All right. Could you
[4426.23s -> 4430.47s]  pull this way and park for me, please? Over here. Parallel park in this spot right here. There's two
[4430.47s -> 4435.99s]  spots available. Not the one in front of the red truck. The one behind it. Behind it? Behind
[4435.99s -> 4442.47s]  the red truck. Use your eyes. You screwed that up. What you needed to do there is you had to.
[4442.71s -> 4449.34s]  I'm not happy about it very much. I'm trying.
[4450.94s -> 4459.75s]  You just hit it. You hit it. You bumped his bumper. You're not getting your license today,
[4459.75s -> 4468.09s]  by the way. Make that very clear. What I have here is I have two bumped cars. I have, would you like
[4468.09s -> 4471.13s]  to see the notes? I don't. You can see it if you want. Would you like to see what I've written
[4471.13s -> 4477.35s]  down? I don't want. Go ahead and look. You bumped a car. You couldn't go more than, you went 40,
[4477.35s -> 4481.99s]  50 miles per hour getting on the on-ramp to the highway. And not only that, you don't know how to
[4481.99s -> 4489.82s]  parallel park. And you guess what? I don't either. Am I on the right side here? Yes. You're pretty
[4489.82s -> 4495.34s]  dumb. Can I just tell you? You're dumb. Do you want me to stop? No human drives a car like this.
[4496.06s -> 4499.66s]  No human. You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably do better than the test than
[4499.66s -> 4504.06s]  you did. Okay. In fact, you'd get an armadillo to do this test and it probably would do better than
[4504.14s -> 4508.94s]  you just did. You get an ant. You get me an army of ants and get them up to the wheel,
[4508.94s -> 4512.54s]  four or five thousand ants, and I could train them to do a better parallel parking job.
[4513.98s -> 4517.90s]  You don't think I could do that? You don't think I could train ants to do that? You don't think I'm
[4517.90s -> 4523.77s]  smart enough to train ants? They'd be running circles around you, by the way. This is ridiculous.
[4523.77s -> 4530.09s]  Terrible. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[4531.05s -> 4535.93s]  Do you see what's in front of us? You do, right? What's in front of us? It's a stop sign. Stop sign.
[4535.93s -> 4544.68s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign. Keep going. Now what I want you to do is I want you to pull
[4544.68s -> 4550.06s]  that McDonald's. Very important part of your test. Driving through a drive-through is actually very
[4550.06s -> 4556.30s]  hard. It's a very narrow road. It's a very narrow part of it. It's hard to kind of navigate in there.
[4556.86s -> 4567.59s]  Stop. Roll your window down. Get out of the way. Yeah, I'll take two double cheeseburgers,
[4569.62s -> 4577.43s]  three McChickens, and a small drink. By the way, they ran out of my sauce. They ran out of my
[4577.43s -> 4584.17s]  sauce, my Szechuan sauce. That's all going on your record here. This is fucking crazy. Hey, howdy,
[4584.17s -> 4588.17s]  how are you? Thank you. Yeah, I'll take it. Thank you. Can you put it over here?
[4588.97s -> 4605.77s]  That was seriously unbelievable. Oh, God, that's so fucking funny. Oh, the fact that you did,
[4606.89s -> 4614.12s]  because the funniest part about that is that dude's just kind of driving around and just reacting to
[4614.12s -> 4621.98s]  this weird guy in his passenger side, right? That's acting right there. God, that was funny.
[4621.98s -> 4629.94s]  All right, this is Jerome. Here's again. Hello, I'm John Lugamy from Look At This
[4629.94s -> 4635.30s]  News Network. In a previous exclusive, we shared the heartwarming story of Jeremy Elbertson,
[4635.30s -> 4640.34s]  a man who had shown us his first time hearing in over 30 years. Wow. Half a year later,
[4640.34s -> 4645.30s]  we caught up with Jeremy to see what he's been doing since then. We set up an online interview
[4645.30s -> 4650.26s]  to get a glimpse into the life of a born again man. Thank you for being with us today, Jeremy.
[4650.26s -> 4654.82s]  Thanks for having me. It seems there's connection issues, but that's okay. Since we're gaining his
[4654.82s -> 4658.98s]  hearing, Jeremy has been working in numerous television roles, such as charity work for drug
[4658.98s -> 4662.58s]  awareness campaigns. But let me just be the first to tell you that, you know, it's not fun,
[4662.58s -> 4672.66s]  but it's not totally Yahoo. Drugs and alcohol. Stay away from them. As well as AMC's hit series,
[4672.66s -> 4686.74s]  Better Call Saul. Better Call Saul, spoilers potentially ahead. I need a little more. Pat,
[4686.74s -> 4698.87s]  pass me the salt, please. Thank you. Very good. That's a patty. Two chops coming up, two chops.
[4698.87s -> 4702.87s]  He's even auditioned for the next Spider-Man trilogy featuring Spider-Man
[4702.87s -> 4718.73s]  and series newcomer Michael Morbius. Oh God, it's Mormon time. Let's go. Jeremy has been a patron
[4718.73s -> 4724.01s]  of the local arts, performing at open mic nights, teaching upcoming stars his knowledge. He's
[4724.01s -> 4742.28s]  displayed talents in magic. It's a joker. Bingo. Here's your card. Thank you. And show tunes.
[4747.66s -> 4754.62s]  Misery. Every single person is my enemy. It seems Jeremy has been busy these last few months
[4754.62s -> 4759.26s]  and goodening the lives of others. We asked Jeremy how we too can end good in lives,
[4759.26s -> 4764.94s]  and he left us with this advice. If you're not feeling great, but you can make somebody else,
[4764.94s -> 4771.26s]  you know that you can make somebody else feel good and be like happy. Do it. Wow. Inspiring.
[4771.50s -> 4777.10s]  I'm John. Look at me. And this has been a look at this news exclusive. Thank you for watching.
[4784.71s -> 4789.83s]  With the first table already seated, Rachel seems agitated. He's not ready and there's hardly
[4789.83s -> 4794.39s]  anything on the menu. So he's not ready. I've never seen anything like this. I've not seen anything
[4794.39s -> 4798.87s]  like this. I only know how to make risotto besides that. I don't know. It's burning.
[4799.67s -> 4803.59s]  You like to talk like you know food, but you actually really don't. Oh, he's very angry.
[4804.23s -> 4809.35s]  Sire, he's angry. Welcome to the madhouse. Stupid, you're all stupid idiots.
[4811.03s -> 4813.50s]  You're dumb. You're the dumbest one here.
[4815.34s -> 4821.02s]  Is this normal? Yes. It's very hard to control them and that is a problem.
[4822.46s -> 4825.50s]  This nut has lost his marbles. This is so sad, you know.
[4827.10s -> 4834.06s]  Coffee. Hey, coffee. When do I get paid? Who wants coffee? Let's go. What's the matter?
[4834.22s -> 4843.16s]  Let go. You will pay in blood. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. It looks like I'm going to have
[4843.16s -> 4856.66s]  to take Jermad to the nut house myself. What the fuck? The goo-goo nest ad? It's more than that.
[4856.66s -> 4862.10s]  With the goo-goo nest doorbell, know if it's a cycle, a corvius, or Jerma. Security with
[4862.10s -> 4870.26s]  goo-goo smarts on the goo-goo nest doorbell. Do you like drugs? Do you like drugs? I've got a lot.
[4870.90s -> 4877.88s]  Weed. Coke. That's all I got. I don't got anything else but you know, common.
[4882.22s -> 4888.10s]  Really, really beautiful lawn you have too. Yeah, I got kids. Yeah, we all get kids, right?
[4888.10s -> 4891.86s]  Look, if you ever um, it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out.
[4892.58s -> 4894.98s]  With the goo-goo nest doorbell, I've got paid either way.
[4900.89s -> 4910.31s]  Oh my goodness. Okay, this is the J-985 incident. My voice is already gone. It's only been an hour
[4910.31s -> 4920.47s]  and a half. Okay, this is a scary one, I think. The J-985 incident could be scary.
[4926.47s -> 4931.35s]  We are currently receiving numerous reports of hostile activity around the country.
[4931.35s -> 4938.23s]  A certain person has been seen near the places of the incidents. They are usually described
[4938.23s -> 4946.15s]  as unusually short by Psycho or the Suspy, but do not be fooled by its appearance. In fact,
[4946.15s -> 4950.63s]  it is an ancient entity of an unknown origin that has already been known to us,
[4950.63s -> 4955.03s]  but recently has started growing its influence and is becoming aggressive.
[4955.03s -> 4960.07s]  In the scientific community, it is referred to as J-985,
[4960.07s -> 4966.31s]  J for its ever juvenile appearance and 985 being the year of its first occurrence.
[4966.31s -> 4970.55s]  If you live within the highlighted area, please exert extra caution.
[4978.18s -> 4987.54s]  I'm seven, seven.
[5002.94s -> 5013.00s]  Hey, hey, what's up? How are you? I'm doing great. Yeah, I just moved in. Yep, new to the neighborhood.
[5013.08s -> 5018.26s]  Right. Look, if you ever, um, it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out
[5018.26s -> 5022.34s]  and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever, I don't, I don't, I don't care.
[5022.34s -> 5029.14s]  Can I, can I come in? Can I just come in and we'll get some mojitos? I make an insane mojito.
[5029.14s -> 5033.54s]  You don't understand. I don't, I don't, I don't care about that. I have to come in though. Can
[5033.54s -> 5038.74s]  I come in your house? Oh, by the way, in case you didn't know, I'm the sus guy.
[5038.74s -> 5041.54s]  What the fuck was that? Was that the sus guy? What was that?
[5061.85s -> 5070.76s]  Amazon logo on the side of the box. Holy shit.
[5094.57s -> 5107.58s]  Oh my God. That, that was crazy. Very good. Very good. All right. This is a Super Derma
[5107.58s -> 5114.79s]  64. Derma's amazing adventure. The Mario ones have been legit so far. So window jump. Yeah.
[5114.79s -> 5118.55s]  I, I, that got me off guard. Okay. Here we go.
[5129.69s -> 5137.38s]  Okie dokie. Oh, ha ha. Oh, hee hee. Oh, bingo. Oh, ha ha. Hee hee. Oh.
[5147.61s -> 5162.30s]  Hey Toad. Oh no. Oh no. Mario need an alibi.
[5173.93s -> 5185.40s]  Come on, let's go. Let's do a little Mario. Oh, just here I go. Oh, I love cookie. Oh, cookie.
[5186.04s -> 5190.10s]  Okie dokie. Cookies? What am I talking about?
[5228.50s -> 5236.74s]  You can't stop me from doing drugs.
[5236.74s -> 5298.07s]  Oh, that was great.
[5301.61s -> 5309.96s]  What's next? Saw, saw 22. That's okay. Here we go.
[5316.09s -> 5321.37s]  There's a key inside of your eyeball. You need to dig it up with your bare hands and then eat it
[5321.37s -> 5325.77s]  and then shit it out. When you shit it out, then only then can you use the key
[5325.77s -> 5327.93s]  to unlock the bear trap that's around John's neck.
[5343.78s -> 5352.25s]  John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John. Wait, wait, wait. How did he get in here?
[5352.25s -> 5356.25s]  How did he get in here? How did he get in here? You're not supposed to be able to get in here.
[5357.29s -> 5363.83s]  Ow. Ow. No. No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5363.83s -> 5366.39s]  Make your choice. Your choice is you can kill me.
[5367.91s -> 5384.84s]  Hi everyone. My name is Sean Elvington. I'm the actor, writer, director, producer,
[5385.56s -> 5389.80s]  and main talent of the daytime television show. Jigsaw is here.
[5391.38s -> 5394.82s]  And I just have something very important that we all have to do. We have to make choices.
[5395.70s -> 5400.52s]  And one choice is for you to watch this show because the ratings have been very poor
[5400.52s -> 5405.91s]  and I believe that we are below reruns of infomercials at this point.
[5406.79s -> 5410.55s]  So I figured we could give you a quick little like maybe you could watch the show if you want.
[5411.99s -> 5418.87s]  For the six to seven hundred of you that do watch the show, thank you so much. It means a lot.
[5418.87s -> 5420.71s]  Cast and crew, we have to put a lot of time into this show.
[5421.67s -> 5424.55s]  So we'll get back to it though. Let's get back to your regularly scheduled programming of
[5424.55s -> 5429.11s]  Jigsaw's coming for you. Written and directed, starring, and produced by me, Sean Elvington.
[5433.29s -> 5439.14s]  Oh my God, that was fucking great. How did he get in here?
[5439.14s -> 5444.34s]  Oh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work. Germaland, a lost episode.
[5445.64s -> 5456.71s]  You got another cart back there. You're gonna have to bring it in.
[5464.58s -> 5469.80s]  Right. Look, I don't, I don't, I don't care. I don't, I don't, I don't,
[5469.80s -> 5474.36s]  I don't care about that. Call somebody else. That's not, I'm literally just here trying to work.
[5479.46s -> 5483.54s]  Why are you, why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me this? I don't want,
[5483.54s -> 5487.62s]  I don't want to hear this. I put up with these fucking people. I swear to God, just screaming
[5487.62s -> 5502.23s]  at me. See, that's it. That's, that's $49. Yeah, put your card in. It goes the other way.
[5503.03s -> 5507.21s]  It goes the other way. The card reader, it goes the other way. You have a chip on it, right?
[5507.21s -> 5513.21s]  You have a chip. The chip goes, chip facing in. How many stores have you been to in your whole life
[5513.21s -> 5530.97s]  that you don't know the chip goes the other way? So mean. That was cute. That was cute.
[5536.36s -> 5555.56s]  All right, what we got next? Remember the X-Wing pilot, Reed E.
[5560.60s -> 5564.52s]  Hey, maybe you could get us, maybe get us a few rounds and we're done with this,
[5564.52s -> 5568.44s]  you know what I'm saying? Holy shit.
[5568.44s -> 5571.24s]  Deepest, darkest, like Star Wars fantasies.
[5573.24s -> 5591.59s]  Watch your status. Watch out, watch out, TIE fighters, TIE fighters coming in.
[5592.55s -> 5602.79s]  Left side, right side. I can't see him, I can't get him, I can't get him, I can't see him.
[5603.83s -> 5604.79s]  This is crazy.
[5610.95s -> 5617.66s]  Paper, Jerma? Jerma's Big Adventure, wait, hold on a minute.
[5618.86s -> 5623.51s]  Jerma's Big Adventure 2 development reveal. Wait, what? What?
[5630.55s -> 5676.15s]  Real game. What? Holy shit, this is insane. We've seen a few games come through here.
[5676.15s -> 5713.67s]  We've seen probably like five to 10 games and they're all awesome. Damn, actually awesome.
[5714.31s -> 5740.86s]  Jerma's Big Adventure 2 now in development. Wow, hell yeah.
[5741.66s -> 5748.81s]  There's other games that I have not shown. There's just, honestly, there's just so much.
[5749.53s -> 5771.62s]  Wait a minute, what the hell was that? That was terrifying.
[5772.74s -> 5777.08s]  But what I was going to say is people in this community are so creative
[5777.08s -> 5784.71s]  that so much shit like this comes out. It's just, it's just hard to even believe sometimes.
[5784.71s -> 5788.33s]  So there's other things, other games that have been in development that
[5788.33s -> 5791.37s]  are kind of focused on the community that I have not even shown yet.
[5791.37s -> 5797.66s]  I haven't, you haven't even seen it. Really, really cool, really cool stuff.
[5797.66s -> 5802.26s]  Here comes Spider-Man 4 teaser trailer. Very real, emotional.
[5802.26s -> 5807.58s]  Here comes, this is going to be probably Spider-Man spoilers for the, you know, you know the deal.
[5807.58s -> 5810.70s]  But I did put on the Spider-Man suit, so here we go.
[5831.61s -> 5833.24s]  Have you crashed your computer?
[5834.28s -> 5841.11s]  I'm here to tell you that you have a choice to make, not do the makeshift.
[5841.11s -> 5842.95s]  Excuse me, fucking Peter Parker just showed up.
[5852.95s -> 5859.40s]  Oh, you have an idea of who you're dealing with? All right, Spider-Man.
[5869.43s -> 5872.66s]  Who's that new man?
[5883.34s -> 5892.89s]  There is nothing out there like the Turbo Quicker.
[5892.89s -> 5898.22s]  Oh, I can't wait for this one. Why was Saul in that movie?
[5898.22s -> 5904.17s]  Right, why did Saul have to be in that movie? Oh, again, Peter.
[5904.17s -> 5906.89s]  Oh, man. All right, this is, that was great.
[5906.89s -> 5908.41s]  This is fucking hilarious.
[5908.41s -> 5912.38s]  Kathy Mitchell's Turbo Cooker, featuring real testimonials.
[5912.38s -> 5913.26s]  Okay, let's go.
[5914.06s -> 5916.54s]  Because there's nothing out there like the Turbo Cooker,
[5916.54s -> 5920.78s]  we decided to give Turbo Cookers to a number of people to use in their own homes.
[5920.78s -> 5922.66s]  Let's hear what they had to say.
[5922.74s -> 5926.58s]  I can take frozen meat out of the freezer, frozen vegetables out of the freezer,
[5926.58s -> 5929.70s]  and have a meal ready in 15 or 20 minutes.
[5929.70s -> 5933.78s]  It's healthy, it's good, and it's good for me.
[5933.78s -> 5937.62s]  You can really minimize the amount of oil that you use in cooking.
[5937.62s -> 5944.84s]  Well, I mean, ever since I was on my own, I, you know, started to cook for myself.
[5944.84s -> 5954.14s]  Ever since I was on my own, and I learned how to make mushroom risotto, and yeah.
[5955.26s -> 5961.66s]  You get the properties of the frying, and you get this remarkable tenderness to the meat.
[5961.66s -> 5965.98s]  I never thought that you could steam a cake on the top of the stove,
[5965.98s -> 5970.70s]  and it turned out so moist better than anything I've ever had.
[5970.70s -> 5973.34s]  And that's what my mom taught me, you know.
[5974.78s -> 5975.98s]  I call her every Sunday.
[5977.83s -> 5982.23s]  It's just easier, it's much healthier, and it brings everything together.
[5982.23s -> 5985.11s]  I like to be able to taste the food that you've just eaten,
[5985.11s -> 5986.63s]  and have that flavor come through.
[5987.19s -> 5991.35s]  So I would much rather do it this way here than to use all that oil to cook it.
[5993.59s -> 5994.94s]  I may have undercooked it.
[5999.26s -> 6002.23s]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[6002.23s -> 6006.07s]  Kathy, thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing us the turbo cooker.
[6006.07s -> 6007.99s]  This is great, it's a complete system.
[6007.99s -> 6009.59s]  It's never going to leave our stove tops.
[6009.59s -> 6009.99s]  Never.
[6009.99s -> 6010.95s]  You knew I wanted it.
[6010.95s -> 6012.95s]  The incredible turbo cooker.
[6014.31s -> 6019.29s]  There is nothing out there like the turbo.
[6019.29s -> 6022.60s]  The whole point with these products is you can't fuck it up.
[6022.60s -> 6026.12s]  You put a steak in, and you come back in six minutes, and it's done.
[6026.12s -> 6032.84s]  You can't undercook something.
[6032.84s -> 6034.28s]  These things are foolproof.
[6034.28s -> 6035.16s]  You can't mess it up.
[6035.88s -> 6037.74s]  I may have undercooked it.
[6044.07s -> 6048.15s]  Oh my god, Jesus Christ.
[6048.15s -> 6050.31s]  All right, let's keep going.
[6050.31s -> 6055.11s]  This one is a Spider-Man versus Jigsaw.
[6055.11s -> 6055.59s]  Here we go.
[6059.72s -> 6071.72s]  It's me, Jigsaw.
[6077.35s -> 6080.73s]  You have no idea who you're dealing with?
[6081.85s -> 6082.81s]  I'm Spider-Man.
[6083.85s -> 6088.17s]  Six weeks ago, you had over 40 Pornhub tabs open at the same time.
[6089.13s -> 6090.41s]  And you crashed your computer.
[6091.93s -> 6096.97s]  So now you have 40 computers with 40 different porn videos on them.
[6098.39s -> 6100.39s]  40 separate pornography videos.
[6101.42s -> 6107.34s]  You need to go and close them all before the knock on the door of your mother.
[6107.34s -> 6108.54s]  I usually, I thought I...
[6108.54s -> 6109.04s]  Find you.
[6109.58s -> 6111.45s]  You have one minute.
[6111.45s -> 6112.25s]  One minute?
[6112.25s -> 6112.89s]  Make your choice.
[6112.89s -> 6113.45s]  I got one minute.
[6114.17s -> 6116.58s]  All right, I got one minute on a clock.
[6116.58s -> 6117.06s]  I can do this.
[6118.10s -> 6119.14s]  All these computers here?
[6120.18s -> 6120.66s]  Okay.
[6120.66s -> 6121.38s]  All right.
[6121.38s -> 6122.74s]  Now, clock's going on now.
[6123.70s -> 6128.89s]  Which one?
[6128.89s -> 6129.61s]  Which one do I start with?
[6129.61s -> 6130.33s]  First, this one over here.
[6130.33s -> 6131.77s]  I'm going to hack into that.
[6131.77s -> 6134.41s]  Oh, by the way, Peter, forgot to mention.
[6134.41s -> 6136.41s]  I know you only have 45 seconds left.
[6137.69s -> 6143.70s]  The room is about to fill with gas, nerd gas.
[6143.70s -> 6145.14s]  Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[6145.14s -> 6147.22s]  Oh, I know nerd gas very well.
[6147.22s -> 6150.58s]  I said nerd gas install one through five.
[6151.78s -> 6153.86s]  Will you be able to succeed?
[6154.50s -> 6155.22s]  I did what you wanted.
[6155.22s -> 6156.02s]  I shut them all off.
[6156.97s -> 6158.01s]  Oh, you did it.
[6158.01s -> 6158.81s]  You did it.
[6158.81s -> 6160.57s]  Hey, he did it.
[6161.37s -> 6162.49s]  You actually did it.
[6163.21s -> 6164.18s]  I did it.
[6164.18s -> 6165.30s]  Steve, what's your name again?
[6165.30s -> 6165.78s]  I forget.
[6167.06s -> 6167.70s]  Good job.
[6167.70s -> 6168.50s]  Go through the door.
[6169.62s -> 6170.34s]  Go out the door.
[6170.34s -> 6170.84s]  You did it.
[6172.78s -> 6173.66s]  How did he get in here?
[6174.38s -> 6175.18s]  How did he get in here?
[6175.82s -> 6177.45s]  You're not supposed to be able to get in here.
[6178.49s -> 6182.17s]  Ow, ouch.
[6182.17s -> 6185.93s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6185.93s -> 6186.89s]  You didn't make your choice.
[6187.53s -> 6188.65s]  Your choice is to be killed.
[6194.63s -> 6196.23s]  Dude, all right, I have a question.
[6197.45s -> 6199.85s]  Why has nobody actually made it a lightsaber?
[6199.85s -> 6203.53s]  It's just nobody has put the the light blade at the end.
[6203.53s -> 6204.49s]  It's just a stick.
[6210.86s -> 6212.38s]  You let you open the door.
[6212.38s -> 6213.66s]  That's so ridiculous.
[6213.66s -> 6214.54s]  I need to do that again.
[6214.54s -> 6216.54s]  How did he get in here?
[6216.54s -> 6218.54s]  How did he get in here?
[6218.54s -> 6220.71s]  How did he get in here?
[6220.71s -> 6223.40s]  How did he get in here?
[6223.40s -> 6225.40s]  You're not supposed to be able to get in here!
[6225.40s -> 6228.86s]  Ow!
[6228.86s -> 6230.86s]  No, no, no, no, no!
[6230.86s -> 6232.86s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
[6232.86s -> 6234.86s]  You didn't make your choice.
[6234.86s -> 6236.86s]  Your choice is to be killed.
[6236.86s -> 6243.51s]  What was the- there was a part in the beginning
[6243.51s -> 6247.80s]  that was funny too.
[6247.80s -> 6255.72s]  God damn it.
[6255.72s -> 6260.63s]  That was a good one.
[6261.63s -> 6265.98s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
[6265.98s -> 6268.72s]  Thanks for coming out.
[6268.72s -> 6270.72s]  We got a new song that we're going to play for you here.
[6270.72s -> 6275.12s]  Hi there.
[6275.12s -> 6277.68s]  Alright, yeah, we're going to play a new song.
[6277.68s -> 6279.68s]  This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[6279.68s -> 6281.68s]  I hope you all enjoy it.
[6281.68s -> 6283.68s]  It's going to be peppy, it's going to be a lot of upbeat,
[6283.68s -> 6286.30s]  so hopefully see somebody out there dancing.
[6286.30s -> 6289.95s]  And a one, two,
[6289.95s -> 6305.82s]  a one, two, three, four.
[6305.82s -> 6310.22s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6317.65s -> 6328.78s]  This is hot, how does it go?
[6329.78s -> 6331.79s]  Hello, my baby.
[6331.79s -> 6335.50s]  No, I can't, you do it.
[6335.50s -> 6337.50s]  I get nervous when we're on a frog.
[6337.50s -> 6339.50s]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[6339.50s -> 6341.50s]  I got it.
[6341.50s -> 6344.83s]  What will I do?
[6344.83s -> 6346.83s]  Check your seat.
[6346.83s -> 6348.83s]  Fucking god damn it, it was so close.
[6350.83s -> 6352.83s]  It was so close!
[6352.83s -> 6358.14s]  Oh my god.
[6365.50s -> 6367.50s]  Arjo, huh?
[6367.50s -> 6369.74s]  Wait, how was it?
[6369.74s -> 6371.74s]  Okay, I can try one more time.
[6398.74s -> 6404.37s]  Switch controller.
[6404.37s -> 6407.76s]  Oh my god.
[6436.08s -> 6439.09s]  Oh my god.
[6439.09s -> 6442.53s]  Stop.
[6442.53s -> 6445.66s]  I've never played Oblivion, I don't know how this works.
[6445.66s -> 6447.66s]  I've never played one minute of Oblivion.
[6447.66s -> 6449.66s]  No, I streamed like a day.
[6449.66s -> 6454.72s]  Yo, it's a me, Mario.
[6454.72s -> 6456.72s]  Oh, okie dokie.
[6456.72s -> 6458.72s]  Oh, haha.
[6458.72s -> 6460.72s]  Oh, hee hee.
[6460.72s -> 6462.72s]  Oh, bingo.
[6462.72s -> 6464.72s]  Oh, haha, hee hee.
[6464.72s -> 6470.29s]  Oh, where's Luigi?
[6470.29s -> 6472.59s]  Where's Luigi?
[6472.59s -> 6481.23s]  I love all the Mario ones.
[6481.23s -> 6483.23s]  They're like so fun.
[6483.23s -> 6505.94s]  Ok, I think it's on.
[6518.14s -> 6520.38s]  Uh oh.
[6520.38s -> 6525.06s]  Yep.
[6525.06s -> 6527.06s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[6527.06s -> 6529.30s]  I'm fucking done with this job.
[6529.30s -> 6531.30s]  I'm never fucking doing Mario ever again.
[6531.30s -> 6537.25s]  Boat rage.
[6537.25s -> 6539.25s]  I learned this one when I was traveling.
[6539.25s -> 6560.03s]  Oh no.
[6560.03s -> 6570.34s]  Please come.
[6570.34s -> 6572.34s]  Don't splash me.
[6572.34s -> 6574.34s]  Throw him out. He splashed me with water.
[6574.34s -> 6576.34s]  Don't splash me.
[6576.34s -> 6578.34s]  Splashing, you can't splash here.
[6578.34s -> 6580.34s]  It says it on the sign before we walked in.
[6580.34s -> 6582.34s]  I'm getting away from him.
[6582.34s -> 6585.98s]  Those of you that want to hear
[6585.98s -> 6587.98s]  another song, follow me please.
[6589.98s -> 6596.64s]  This one's called the train tracks.
[6596.64s -> 6623.87s]  No, I don't care.
[6623.87s -> 6634.11s]  What'd I get?
[6636.11s -> 6638.11s]  That's a big one.
[6638.11s -> 6645.15s]  I'll get one more out there.
[6645.15s -> 6647.46s]  That's a big one right here.
[6647.46s -> 6649.46s]  That's a huge one.
[6657.97s -> 6670.43s]  I always have to be traveling.
[6670.43s -> 6672.43s]  That was awesome by the way.
[6674.43s -> 6679.22s]  Oh shit.
[6681.22s -> 6683.22s]  It's wrapping for this one.
[6683.22s -> 6746.43s]  That was awesome.
[6746.43s -> 6749.38s]  That was fucking awesome.
[6749.38s -> 6751.68s]  Wow. Nice work.
[6751.68s -> 6755.84s]  Germania 2022 character reveal.
[6755.84s -> 6757.84s]  Madness update out now.
[6757.84s -> 6762.56s]  Wonder what that means.
[6762.56s -> 6764.80s]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[6764.80s -> 6766.80s]  Welcome to the second ever
[6766.80s -> 6768.80s]  Germa Roman.
[6768.80s -> 6770.80s]  I hope you're ready for some newcomers
[6770.80s -> 6778.80s]  as well as some old vagabonds.
[6778.80s -> 6780.80s]  The cave grew into groceries in a good world.
[6780.80s -> 6782.80s]  That's what he typically does.
[6782.80s -> 6784.80s]  Tell them you're the sus guy.
[6784.80s -> 6786.80s]  Brrram, brrram, brrram.
[6788.80s -> 6791.68s]  I must find out what happened.
[6791.68s -> 6793.68s]  I must uncover the secrets
[6793.68s -> 6795.68s]  of my old family.
[6795.68s -> 6797.68s]  The secrets.
[6797.68s -> 6799.68s]  Oh my god.
[6801.68s -> 6804.62s]  No, no, no, no.
[6804.62s -> 6806.62s]  I see something horrible.
[6806.62s -> 6809.12s]  I'm close.
[6821.46s -> 6824.98s]  Damn.
[6824.98s -> 6826.98s]  Holy shit. Hold on a second.
[6826.98s -> 6833.82s]  Wait a minute, wait a minute. We gotta go back.
[6833.82s -> 6835.82s]  I wanna see that combo.
[6835.82s -> 6837.82s]  That combo was sick.
[6840.64s -> 6846.78s]  Look at this, watch this combo.
[6846.78s -> 6848.78s]  I must find out what happened.
[6848.78s -> 6850.78s]  I must uncover the secrets
[6850.78s -> 6852.78s]  of my old family.
[6852.78s -> 6854.78s]  The secrets, the secrets.
[6858.78s -> 6861.28s]  Oh no, no, no.
[6861.28s -> 6863.28s]  I see something horrible.
[6863.28s -> 6869.54s]  I'm close.
[6869.54s -> 6876.32s]  Dude, that was awesome.
[6876.32s -> 6878.32s]  Alright, we're gonna exit.
[6878.32s -> 6880.32s]  It has to be a big shot.
[6880.32s -> 6882.32s]  Deltarune.
[6891.82s -> 6893.82s]  Damn.
[6948.69s -> 6955.26s]  That was awesome.
[6955.26s -> 6958.53s]  Dump truck studios.
[6958.53s -> 6961.66s]  Holy smokes.
[6961.66s -> 6963.66s]  The mod chat is lighting up here.
[6963.66s -> 6966.34s]  How did some of you guys
[6966.34s -> 6969.47s]  do this shit in two weeks?
[6969.47s -> 6971.47s]  You know what I mean? Some of you made these in
[6971.47s -> 6979.71s]  four days. Huh?
[6979.71s -> 6983.17s]  Unbelievable. Alright, after this one we're gonna take
[6983.17s -> 6985.17s]  a quick intermission. I'm gonna go pee. I'm gonna refill
[6985.17s -> 6987.17s]  my water and I might
[6987.17s -> 6990.56s]  get a little bit of an alcoholic beverage.
[6990.56s -> 6994.46s]  This is a German 95 RPG.
[6994.46s -> 7004.51s]  I wonder, I'm curious.
[7004.51s -> 7010.72s]  Are you ready? Bald coins.
[7010.72s -> 7018.43s]  Got it. Auto. Auto.
[7019.43s -> 7025.58s]  The giant rat.
[7025.58s -> 7027.58s]  Alright, you cartoon monster.
[7027.58s -> 7029.58s]  Okay, now I kill you.
[7037.50s -> 7039.50s]  You shall not pass.
[7059.91s -> 7063.05s]  I can't just stand here all day, dude.
[7086.46s -> 7088.46s]  That one is bad.
[7088.46s -> 7091.91s]  Let's go. Look at me right now.
[7091.91s -> 7094.41s]  I won.
[7094.41s -> 7097.48s]  Nice. That was awesome.
[7099.48s -> 7101.48s]  Alright, one more. One more and we'll take a
[7101.48s -> 7103.48s]  pee break.
[7130.10s -> 7132.10s]  I'll leave. I'll leave. I'll leave, but
[7132.10s -> 7134.10s]  that's...
[7134.10s -> 7136.34s]  Are you ready? I bet you're
[7136.34s -> 7138.34s]  scared. I'm not scared at all.
[7138.34s -> 7140.34s]  Where am I?
[7140.34s -> 7142.34s]  What's going on here?
[7142.34s -> 7144.34s]  Yeah. Okay.
[7144.34s -> 7146.97s]  Are you ready? Because, I mean,
[7146.97s -> 7148.97s]  very clearly we gotta go.
[7148.97s -> 7150.97s]  You have an idea who you're dealing with?
[7150.97s -> 7153.46s]  Alright, Spider-Man.
[7153.46s -> 7155.46s]  Are you ready? You don't look ready.
[7155.46s -> 7157.46s]  It's alright. I'm alright. I'm alright.
[7157.46s -> 7160.02s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7160.02s -> 7162.02s]  Hey. How much?
[7162.02s -> 7167.26s]  Huh? You're the one with the money.
[7167.26s -> 7169.99s]  Hey. You know what I mean?
[7169.99s -> 7172.42s]  How much?
[7172.42s -> 7174.42s]  No, I ain't gonna scream.
[7174.42s -> 7179.22s]  You're gonna scream, though.
[7179.22s -> 7181.22s]  Did you know that you have rights?
[7181.22s -> 7183.22s]  I'm struggling to identify what the hell you're doing.
[7183.22s -> 7186.23s]  I really am.
[7186.23s -> 7188.23s]  It's Master Chef, not Master Bait.
[7188.23s -> 7190.23s]  Hello, students.
[7190.23s -> 7193.11s]  Welcome to the Defense of the Dark Arts class.
[7193.11s -> 7196.70s]  My name is
[7196.70s -> 7198.87s]  Michel Malfoyle. I'm the new
[7198.87s -> 7201.30s]  teacher in time.
[7201.30s -> 7203.30s]  If we could all open up your textbooks and go to
[7203.30s -> 7205.30s]  page 200, please.
[7205.30s -> 7207.48s]  We're going to be using...
[7207.48s -> 7209.48s]  Yes? Yes?
[7209.48s -> 7211.48s]  Ron, please.
[7211.48s -> 7214.62s]  There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.
[7214.62s -> 7216.62s]  Page 200, we're gonna be making a frog
[7216.62s -> 7219.50s]  breath potion.
[7219.50s -> 7221.50s]  You know all about that, don't you, Harry?
[7221.50s -> 7224.50s]  Open up your textbook.
[7228.34s -> 7231.93s]  I'm in the middle of teaching, Harry.
[7231.93s -> 7233.93s]  That's not the time to use that spell.
[7233.93s -> 7236.23s]  No, fuck you.
[7236.23s -> 7238.23s]  You see what I got dealing with back here?
[7238.23s -> 7244.82s]  Hello, boys and girls.
[7244.82s -> 7247.19s]  It's-a me, Mario.
[7247.19s -> 7249.19s]  Let me tell you something about
[7249.19s -> 7251.75s]  drugs and alcohol.
[7251.75s -> 7253.75s]  My brother Luigi.
[7261.43s -> 7264.12s]  Okay, nobody used this for anything else
[7264.12s -> 7266.12s]  besides what we're doing this for.
[7266.12s -> 7268.12s]  There's no way anyone's gonna use this for anything else besides
[7268.12s -> 7270.12s]  riding a fucking roller coaster.
[7270.12s -> 7278.50s]  Alright, that's enough.
[7278.50s -> 7281.18s]  Alright.
[7281.18s -> 7283.61s]  Let's take a quick two, three minute break.
[7283.61s -> 7287.11s]  We're at the two hour mark.
[7287.11s -> 7289.11s]  I'm gonna take a look at the videos. We'll see how much we have left.
[7289.11s -> 7291.11s]  I think we have another solid, probably at least two, three hours.
[7291.11s -> 7294.81s]  Let's go pee.
[7294.81s -> 7296.81s]  Go get another snack, maybe. I'll be back in about three minutes.
[7296.81s -> 7299.56s]  See you guys in three to four
[7299.56s -> 7630.57s]  maybe-ish minutes.
[7630.57s -> 7635.93s]  I have returned. Hello.
[7635.93s -> 7643.78s]  My stomach hurts. My stomach hurts.
[7643.78s -> 7649.80s]  Every time we do one of these,
[7649.80s -> 7652.23s]  I get an ab workout, unlike any I've
[7652.23s -> 7655.94s]  ever had before. This one is called
[7655.94s -> 7657.94s]  We're Coming Back. Everyone good?
[7657.94s -> 7664.86s]  Are we settled? That's also another reason why
[7664.86s -> 7667.35s]  I mean, we can only really do this
[7667.35s -> 7670.02s]  for four or five
[7670.02s -> 7672.02s]  hours, you know what I mean? Cause otherwise
[7672.02s -> 7675.22s]  I'm gonna die. I will literally die.
[7675.22s -> 7677.85s]  So don't worry.
[7677.85s -> 7680.02s]  We're gonna do this another one or two more times
[7680.02s -> 7682.71s]  and get through these. I promise.
[7682.71s -> 7690.25s]  Alright, you guys ready?
[7690.25s -> 7693.58s]  Let's bring it back. Bring this back too.
[7693.58s -> 7697.40s]  And let's keep going. This one's called
[7697.40s -> 7699.40s]  I found an old recording of Derma on
[7699.40s -> 7702.09s]  MTV. I wonder what
[7702.09s -> 7734.58s]  it is.
[7734.58s -> 7736.58s]  Hello, my honey. Hello, my
[7736.58s -> 7738.58s]  ragtime girl.
[7738.58s -> 7740.58s]  Send me a kiss, my
[7740.58s -> 7743.27s]  baby, my heart's on fire.
[7743.27s -> 7745.77s]  If you lose me, baby,
[7745.77s -> 7747.77s]  you'll lose me. And you will have to
[7747.77s -> 7749.77s]  load and tell me, tell me
[7749.77s -> 7777.67s]  the lie. Hello,
[7777.67s -> 7800.89s]  my honey. Damn.
[7800.89s -> 7802.89s]  That was some clean editing.
[7802.89s -> 7830.66s]  Derma goes to Mordor.
[7830.66s -> 7832.66s]  This is gonna be fucking loud.
[7832.66s -> 7838.22s]  Hiya.
[7838.22s -> 7840.71s]  Turn them back off!
[7840.71s -> 7844.17s]  My brothers!
[7844.17s -> 7846.17s]  We're going the wrong way.
[7846.17s -> 7848.17s]  I see in your eyes
[7848.17s -> 7850.47s]  the same fear that would take the
[7850.47s -> 7853.54s]  heart of me.
[7853.54s -> 7857.13s]  When the courage of men
[7857.13s -> 7859.13s]  fails. When we forsake
[7859.13s -> 7861.13s]  our friends and break all bonds of
[7861.13s -> 7863.13s]  fellowship. But it is not this
[7863.13s -> 7865.13s]  day.
[7865.13s -> 7867.13s]  An hour of woes
[7867.13s -> 7869.13s]  and shattered shields when the age of
[7869.13s -> 7871.13s]  men comes crashing down.
[7871.13s -> 7873.13s]  But it is not this day!
[7873.13s -> 7875.13s]  This day we fight!
[7875.13s -> 7877.13s]  We have bees on this planet.
[7877.13s -> 7879.13s]  Think about what a bee does.
[7879.13s -> 7881.13s]  Think about what a bee does.
[7881.13s -> 7883.13s]  Hold on. Pause it.
[7883.13s -> 7885.13s]  Alright. That was so
[7885.13s -> 7887.13s]  stupid. It sucks. It's not even
[7887.13s -> 7889.13s]  funny. What? This is terrible.
[7889.13s -> 7891.13s]  You're a bad editor hand. You're ugly.
[7891.13s -> 7893.13s]  I didn't say that. That's not true.
[7893.13s -> 7895.13s]  I didn't say that! Nothing about this is good.
[7895.13s -> 7897.13s]  That's not me. That's not me talking.
[7897.13s -> 7899.13s]  I don't think I'm gonna
[7899.13s -> 7901.13s]  skip this one. I hate this. This is terrible.
[7901.13s -> 7903.13s]  I don't know. This one's stupid.
[7903.13s -> 7905.13s]  Let's see what kind of a shot
[7905.13s -> 7907.13s]  you are, pilgrim. Take a crack at this bottle.
[7907.13s -> 7909.13s]  Let's see what...
[7909.13s -> 7911.13s]  What?
[7911.13s -> 7913.13s]  I need to see that again. That honestly freaks
[7913.13s -> 7915.13s]  me out. I was like what?
[7915.13s -> 7918.01s]  Why do I hear myself? My head.
[7918.01s -> 7920.01s]  An hour of woes.
[7920.01s -> 7922.01s]  This day we fight! We have bees on
[7922.01s -> 7924.01s]  this planet. Think about what a bee
[7924.01s -> 7926.01s]  does. Think about what a bee does.
[7926.01s -> 7928.01s]  Hold on. Pause it.
[7928.01s -> 7930.01s]  Alright. That was
[7930.01s -> 7932.01s]  something else you need to be aware of
[7932.01s -> 7934.18s]  is the balls here.
[7934.18s -> 7936.55s]  They're here.
[7936.55s -> 7939.22s]  They didn't edit these out.
[7939.22s -> 7949.72s]  There's just funny balls here.
[7949.72s -> 7951.72s]  Alright. That was stupid.
[7951.72s -> 7953.72s]  It sucks. It's not even funny.
[7953.72s -> 7955.72s]  Person editing this is terrible.
[7955.72s -> 7957.72s]  You're a bad editor hand. You're ugly.
[7957.72s -> 7959.72s]  I didn't say that. That's not true. This is stupid.
[7959.72s -> 7961.72s]  I didn't say that! Nothing about this is good.
[7961.72s -> 7963.72s]  That's not me. Not one thing. I'm not...
[7963.72s -> 7965.72s]  I don't think I'm gonna
[7965.72s -> 7967.72s]  skip this one. I hate this. This is terrible.
[7967.72s -> 7969.72s]  I don't know. This one's stupid.
[8013.24s -> 8015.24s]  Temporal up here.
[8015.24s -> 8017.24s]  Mario!
[8022.04s -> 8032.65s]  Medic!
[8032.65s -> 8035.14s]  Medic! Medic!
[8037.14s -> 8045.34s]  How many times you joined a server
[8045.34s -> 8047.34s]  to realize there was nobody in it and you
[8047.34s -> 8049.34s]  just did that for like 10 minutes. You refused to leave.
[8049.34s -> 8051.34s]  Oh my god! What the fuck
[8051.34s -> 8053.34s]  was that? What was that ending?
[8053.34s -> 8055.34s]  What the hell?
[8055.34s -> 8057.34s]  Holy shit!
[8075.11s -> 8077.11s]  I'm in trouble! I'm keeping an eye on you.
[8077.11s -> 8079.99s]  It's warming time!
[8079.99s -> 8081.99s]  Let's go!
[8081.99s -> 8113.67s]  A rose!
[8113.67s -> 8123.64s]  Oh.
[8123.64s -> 8130.94s]  It's warming time!
[8130.94s -> 8135.48s]  Huh!
[8135.48s -> 8138.55s]  Fucking Morpheus.
[8141.37s -> 8146.23s]  Try again.
[8146.23s -> 8149.30s]  Oh, these look so
[8149.30s -> 8151.30s]  good. They really are.
[8151.30s -> 8156.49s]  How are we doing? How are we? Good?
[8156.49s -> 8158.49s]  Driving school? You can begin at any
[8158.49s -> 8160.49s]  point. I'm gonna be paying a lot of attention
[8160.49s -> 8165.42s]  to what you're doing, by the way.
[8165.42s -> 8167.42s]  You can come out here and take a right.
[8167.42s -> 8173.56s]  Easy on the gas. Easy. Hold it back.
[8173.56s -> 8176.82s]  A little on
[8176.82s -> 8179.70s]  the gas there. You can
[8179.70s -> 8183.29s]  get on the highway here. Stop.
[8183.29s -> 8185.29s]  Slow down.
[8185.29s -> 8190.54s]  I'm gonna have to take off a few points for that
[8190.54s -> 8192.84s]  one. But you didn't signal.
[8192.84s -> 8194.84s]  You didn't signal when you went right and that's the first
[8194.84s -> 8196.84s]  thing that we're gonna do here. By the way, if you get
[8196.84s -> 8198.84s]  four or five points wrong here,
[8198.84s -> 8200.84s]  your license is not gonna come through.
[8200.84s -> 8203.34s]  And I am a stickler.
[8203.34s -> 8205.34s]  Very much so for these points.
[8205.34s -> 8207.83s]  Just keep that in mind.
[8207.83s -> 8211.74s]  You can merge over here if you want.
[8214.23s -> 8217.05s]  Slowly
[8217.05s -> 8219.05s]  merge. Slowly merge.
[8219.05s -> 8221.42s]  Way too fast.
[8221.42s -> 8223.91s]  Actually
[8223.91s -> 8226.86s]  too fast. It's a very big
[8226.86s -> 8228.86s]  car. Yeah, that's why I have it.
[8228.86s -> 8230.86s]  Just making sure I can see what you're up to.
[8230.86s -> 8238.34s]  Could you pull this way
[8238.34s -> 8241.35s]  and park for me, please?
[8241.35s -> 8243.35s]  This is the parallel parking part of the exam.
[8243.35s -> 8245.72s]  Over here, parallel parking
[8245.72s -> 8247.72s]  this spot right here. There's two spots available.
[8247.72s -> 8249.72s]  Not the one in front of the red truck. The one behind it.
[8251.72s -> 8253.72s]  Behind the red truck.
[8253.72s -> 8256.02s]  Use your eyes.
[8256.02s -> 8258.20s]  Do you want these?
[8258.20s -> 8261.98s]  Do you want to put these on?
[8261.98s -> 8263.98s]  I told you I was a stickler and I'm gonna be
[8263.98s -> 8265.98s]  that. Get up there in parallel park.
[8265.98s -> 8270.07s]  You hit it.
[8270.07s -> 8272.07s]  You hit it. You bumped his
[8272.07s -> 8276.42s]  bumper. Give me the wheel.
[8276.42s -> 8278.42s]  Let me show you how it's done. Here, you hold this.
[8278.42s -> 8280.42s]  Yeah, you grade me.
[8280.42s -> 8282.60s]  You grade me.
[8282.60s -> 8287.53s]  You go ahead and grade me.
[8287.53s -> 8290.22s]  Put the gas on.
[8290.22s -> 8293.16s]  This is how you do it.
[8293.16s -> 8297.13s]  This is how you drive a goddamn car.
[8297.13s -> 8299.13s]  You can go to sleep if you want. I got this.
[8299.13s -> 8306.02s]  Very nice. Pull it in.
[8306.02s -> 8308.02s]  Parallel parking. This is how we parallel park.
[8308.02s -> 8310.02s]  Be careful.
[8310.02s -> 8312.02s]  Be careful. Be careful.
[8312.02s -> 8314.02s]  You mind?
[8314.02s -> 8316.02s]  Let me go.
[8316.02s -> 8318.02s]  Step on the gas.
[8318.02s -> 8320.63s]  Step on the brake.
[8320.63s -> 8322.87s]  Step on the gas again.
[8322.87s -> 8325.50s]  And we're in the spot.
[8325.50s -> 8329.02s]  How did I do, coach?
[8329.02s -> 8331.02s]  What did you put down for me? Did you give me an A?
[8331.02s -> 8333.02s]  Get out of the car.
[8333.02s -> 8353.11s]  King Andy's evil reign
[8353.11s -> 8355.11s]  reaches far and wide.
[8355.11s -> 8357.11s]  He has obliterated his entire
[8357.11s -> 8359.11s]  bloodline for selfish gain
[8359.11s -> 8361.11s]  to be the true germite.
[8361.11s -> 8363.54s]  What he doesn't know is that there is
[8363.54s -> 8365.54s]  one left of his kind.
[8365.54s -> 8369.32s]  Who seeks revenge.
[8372.78s -> 8374.78s]  I'm not scared, though. Are you scared?
[8374.78s -> 8376.78s]  Yeah, I bet you are.
[8376.78s -> 8378.78s]  I bet you're scared.
[8378.78s -> 8380.78s]  I'm not scared at all.
[8380.78s -> 8384.15s]  Whoa, hey!
[8384.15s -> 8386.58s]  Hey, you can see the whole park
[8386.58s -> 8388.58s]  from here. Can you see?
[8388.58s -> 8390.58s]  That's crazy.
[8390.58s -> 8392.58s]  Hear thee, people of the parklands.
[8392.58s -> 8394.58s]  There is a dangerous creature stalking
[8394.58s -> 8396.58s]  the caves. Who is brave enough
[8396.58s -> 8398.58s]  to kill the monster?
[8398.58s -> 8400.58s]  Hello there, germite.
[8400.58s -> 8402.58s]  You seem ready for a quest.
[8402.58s -> 8404.58s]  No, no. No, I'm sorry.
[8404.58s -> 8406.58s]  No, I ain't gonna do it. Are you sure
[8406.58s -> 8408.58s]  you don't want to kill the monster?
[8408.58s -> 8410.58s]  No, fuck you. Fucking hell.
[8410.58s -> 8412.58s]  You see what I got dealing with back here?
[8412.58s -> 8414.58s]  You think I'm gonna do that shit? Well,
[8414.58s -> 8416.58s]  this mission does progress the story.
[8416.58s -> 8418.58s]  How? Well, I don't know.
[8418.58s -> 8420.58s]  This is the starting mission. No.
[8420.58s -> 8422.58s]  You do it. You go do it. You deal with
[8422.58s -> 8424.58s]  this. I'm not dealing with that. What are you talking about?
[8424.58s -> 8426.58s]  I may have caused it, but I'm not gonna deal with it.
[8426.58s -> 8428.58s]  Wait a minute. You put the monster in the cave
[8428.58s -> 8430.58s]  that's killed thousands of children?
[8430.58s -> 8432.58s]  Yes.
[8432.58s -> 8434.58s]  Jesus Christ.
[8434.58s -> 8436.58s]  Hey. How much?
[8436.58s -> 8438.58s]  Look, I'll just give you a potion. Can you please kill
[8438.58s -> 8440.58s]  the monster? Yes. I can tolerate
[8440.58s -> 8442.58s]  them when they're in small doses. Whatever. Just
[8442.58s -> 8444.58s]  take the potion, man. Thank you.
[8448.58s -> 8450.58s]  Oh my God!
[8452.58s -> 8454.58s]  No.
[8459.62s -> 8462.12s]  No. Absolutely not.
[8462.12s -> 8466.09s]  I want everyone to understand
[8466.09s -> 8468.09s]  that the king made a lot of good
[8468.09s -> 8470.09s]  things happen today, don't you think?
[8470.09s -> 8473.10s]  The jester over there, you're
[8473.10s -> 8475.10s]  so funny. How do I do it?
[8475.10s -> 8477.10s]  I made things happen. I raised taxes
[8477.10s -> 8479.10s]  on everybody. How many people did we kill today?
[8479.10s -> 8481.10s]  Sixty? Yeah.
[8481.10s -> 8483.10s]  That's a lot. What'd you say?
[8483.10s -> 8485.10s]  What'd you say?
[8485.10s -> 8490.20s]  Feed him to the lions.
[8490.20s -> 8492.20s]  Oh, Jerma's revenge on King Andy
[8492.20s -> 8494.20s]  was sweet. He made one fatal
[8494.20s -> 8496.20s]  error in skipping
[8496.20s -> 8498.20s]  the first mission that your monster
[8498.20s -> 8500.20s]  made its way to Jerma and hit him over the head
[8500.20s -> 8502.20s]  with a big wooden mallet
[8502.20s -> 8504.20s]  marking the end of the
[8504.20s -> 8506.20s]  Jermite bloodline and paving
[8506.20s -> 8508.20s]  way for the destruction of the
[8508.20s -> 8511.53s]  world.
[8514.02s -> 8516.02s]  Terrifying moments for a downtown Las Vegas
[8516.02s -> 8518.02s]  homeowner who posted this video on
[8518.02s -> 8520.02s]  social media showing the suspect
[8520.02s -> 8522.02s]  making threats. The homeowner
[8522.02s -> 8524.02s]  who we won't be identifying posted
[8524.02s -> 8526.02s]  this on social media and asked her followers
[8526.02s -> 8528.02s]  to share the video widely so
[8528.02s -> 8530.02s]  people could be aware that the man
[8530.02s -> 8532.02s]  is out there. At first,
[8532.02s -> 8534.02s]  you can see the man just not making much
[8534.02s -> 8536.02s]  sense, repeating himself.
[8536.02s -> 8539.80s]  Could I come in?
[8539.80s -> 8542.04s]  Could I come in your house?
[8542.04s -> 8544.04s]  Could I come in? Yeah.
[8544.04s -> 8546.65s]  Could I come in?
[8546.65s -> 8548.65s]  Let me in your house, please.
[8548.65s -> 8555.88s]  Could I come in?
[8555.88s -> 8557.88s]  Could I come in your house? This really happened?
[8557.88s -> 8563.43s]  Holy shit. It's terrifying.
[8563.43s -> 8565.43s]  That is disturbing. Afterwards,
[8565.43s -> 8567.43s]  the man escalated things.
[8567.43s -> 8571.34s]  Do you like drugs? Do you like drugs?
[8571.34s -> 8573.70s]  I got a lot.
[8573.70s -> 8575.70s]  Just let me in your house and I'll give you whatever you want.
[8575.70s -> 8579.66s]  Bleed. Coke.
[8579.66s -> 8582.34s]  That's all I got.
[8582.34s -> 8586.63s]  Let me in your house!
[8586.63s -> 8589.64s]  The post-lemon neighborhood
[8589.64s -> 8591.64s]  and people all over the valley
[8591.64s -> 8593.64s]  shaken. That man has since been
[8593.64s -> 8597.74s]  arrested. What the
[8597.74s -> 8599.74s]  fuck?
[8599.74s -> 8606.20s]  Jerma Ware, Incorporated.
[8606.20s -> 8611.00s]  Oh!
[8611.00s -> 8613.00s]  I heard so many people use
[8613.00s -> 8616.07s]  the hee-hee shit.
[8616.07s -> 8618.38s]  Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Super Mario.
[8618.38s -> 8621.77s]  So what does someone
[8621.77s -> 8623.77s]  look like? Okay, let me do some Mario stuff.
[8623.77s -> 8627.93s]  Brian Griffith.
[8627.93s -> 8636.18s]  Yahoo! Uh-oh.
[8636.18s -> 8641.11s]  I hope I can keep the viewers.
[8641.11s -> 8663.45s]  The caveman routine.
[8663.45s -> 8666.71s]  I love it's only shown up twice.
[8666.71s -> 8673.50s]  Boy!
[8673.50s -> 8675.50s]  Where's Luigi?
[8675.50s -> 8677.50s]  Where's Luigi?
[8677.50s -> 8679.50s]  God of the game.
[8679.50s -> 8683.26s]  There's no way I fit in this thing.
[8683.26s -> 8687.16s]  Where are you?
[8687.16s -> 8695.99s]  Absolutely terrible.
[8695.99s -> 8697.99s]  I learned this one when I was traveling.
[8697.99s -> 8703.88s]  Jerma and Danger.
[8703.88s -> 8713.86s]  Brod, right?
[8713.86s -> 8724.62s]  My god!
[8724.62s -> 8726.62s]  I'm going out to sea.
[8726.62s -> 8744.97s]  Don't splash me!
[8744.97s -> 8746.97s]  Don't splash me! Throw him out!
[8746.97s -> 8748.97s]  He splashed me with water.
[8748.97s -> 8750.97s]  Don't splash me. Splashing.
[8750.97s -> 8752.97s]  You can't splash here. It says it on the sign
[8752.97s -> 8754.97s]  that you walked in. Don't splash people.
[8754.97s -> 8756.97s]  You don't want to splash
[8756.97s -> 8758.97s]  you fucking idiot.
[8758.97s -> 8762.10s]  I'm going to splash you.
[8762.10s -> 8764.10s]  Throw him out. Throw him out.
[8764.10s -> 8776.97s]  I'm getting
[8776.97s -> 8778.97s]  away from him.
[8778.97s -> 8781.91s]  Those of you that want to hear another song,
[8781.91s -> 8783.91s]  follow me, please.
[8783.91s -> 8788.46s]  It's not how you...
[8788.46s -> 8790.46s]  It's called the train tracks.
[8790.46s -> 8798.46s]  Going the wrong way.
[8798.46s -> 8800.46s]  Good. Good. I hit him in the fucking head.
[8800.46s -> 8803.59s]  I don't care.
[8803.59s -> 8814.41s]  The accordion just sitting
[8814.41s -> 8827.40s]  in the water.
[8840.50s -> 8844.22s]  Oh my god. Jesus.
[8844.22s -> 8848.12s]  Mario tells...
[8848.12s -> 8850.12s]  Is this a hare?
[8853.58s -> 8858.74s]  Oh, boys and girls.
[8858.74s -> 8860.74s]  It's a me, Mario.
[8860.74s -> 8863.18s]  Let me tell you something.
[8863.18s -> 8865.35s]  If somebody want to tell you to take
[8865.35s -> 8867.35s]  drugs, always
[8867.35s -> 8869.35s]  say no. You see
[8869.35s -> 8871.35s]  Luigi tried to drink
[8871.35s -> 8873.35s]  and do drugs one time. And I
[8873.35s -> 8875.35s]  said no. And he said Mario.
[8875.35s -> 8877.35s]  And I said no.
[8877.35s -> 8879.35s]  Fucking god damn
[8879.35s -> 8881.35s]  ****. Let me tell you
[8881.35s -> 8883.35s]  something about drugs and drugs.
[8883.35s -> 8885.35s]  Oh no. You should never
[8885.35s -> 8887.35s]  take any drugs. Never.
[8887.35s -> 8889.35s]  Mario wouldn't. Luigi wouldn't.
[8889.35s -> 8891.35s]  Totally.
[8891.35s -> 8893.35s]  Maybe.
[8893.35s -> 8895.53s]  ****.
[8895.53s -> 8897.53s]  ****.
[8897.53s -> 8899.53s]  ****.
[8899.53s -> 8901.53s]  ****.
[8901.53s -> 8903.53s]  Get the **** out of here.
[8903.53s -> 8905.53s]  Sit the ****
[8905.53s -> 8907.53s]  down, Bowser.
[8907.53s -> 8913.61s]  Bowser.
[8913.61s -> 8917.83s]  It's
[8917.83s -> 8919.83s]  so stupid. It's jolly.
[8919.83s -> 8921.83s]  Your arms from side to side.
[8921.83s -> 8923.83s]  Come on, everyone. Go do
[8923.83s -> 8925.83s]  the Mario.
[8925.83s -> 8934.28s]  OK. You can do this, Mario.
[8934.28s -> 8936.97s]  It's a me, Mario.
[8936.97s -> 8939.46s]  Let me tell you something
[8939.46s -> 8941.46s]  about drugs and alcohol.
[8941.46s -> 8944.09s]  My brother, Luigi, would also
[8944.09s -> 8946.09s]  say this too. We both
[8946.09s -> 8948.09s]  would say this.
[8948.09s -> 8950.09s]  ****.
[8950.09s -> 8952.09s]  No.
[8952.09s -> 8954.09s]  No.
[8954.09s -> 8956.09s]  How do you do it?
[8956.09s -> 8958.09s]  No.
[8958.09s -> 8960.97s]  She's looking at me like I'm fucking crazy.
[8960.97s -> 8962.97s]  She was.
[8962.97s -> 8964.97s]  I saw you laughing in the corner.
[8964.97s -> 8966.97s]  What's wrong?
[8966.97s -> 8968.97s]  What's wrong?
[8968.97s -> 8972.17s]  Just cut
[8972.17s -> 8974.17s]  them together, OK?
[8974.17s -> 8976.17s]  This job.
[8976.17s -> 8993.82s]  It's a me, Mario.
[8993.82s -> 8995.82s]  I want to talk to you about drugs.
[8995.82s -> 8997.82s]  Boys and girls, don't do
[8997.82s -> 8999.82s]  drugs. You don't have to do them.
[8999.82s -> 9001.82s]  Don't feel pressured to take drugs
[9001.82s -> 9003.82s]  or drink. If anyone ever
[9003.82s -> 9005.82s]  pressures you, tell him Mario
[9005.82s -> 9007.82s]  said, so long, King Bowser.
[9007.82s -> 9009.82s]  And they will leave you alone.
[9009.82s -> 9011.82s]  No.
[9011.82s -> 9013.82s]  Hello.
[9013.82s -> 9015.82s]  It's a me, Mario.
[9015.82s -> 9017.82s]  I have to do a drug PSA.
[9017.82s -> 9019.82s]  OK. I'm done.
[9019.82s -> 9023.53s]  Jesus.
[9050.04s -> 9075.43s]  Oh, ****.
[9075.43s -> 9079.08s]  Holy ****. That was good.
[9079.08s -> 9081.08s]  The duck story?
[9081.08s -> 9083.08s]  A duck
[9083.08s -> 9085.08s]  walked up to a lemonade stand
[9085.08s -> 9087.08s]  and he said to the man
[9087.08s -> 9089.08s]  running the stand, hey
[9089.08s -> 9092.47s]  got any grapes?
[9092.47s -> 9096.38s]  The man said
[9096.38s -> 9100.22s]  What?
[9100.22s -> 9102.22s]  Then he waddled away
[9102.22s -> 9104.22s]  until the very next day
[9104.22s -> 9106.22s]  when the duck
[9106.22s -> 9108.22s]  walked up to the lemonade stand
[9108.22s -> 9110.22s]  and he said to the man
[9110.22s -> 9112.22s]  running the stand, hey
[9112.22s -> 9114.22s]  got any grapes?
[9114.22s -> 9118.74s]  The man said
[9118.74s -> 9121.18s]  Now **** you.
[9146.34s -> 9148.52s]  I'm killing you.
[9148.52s -> 9150.52s]  I don't care about anything else.
[9150.52s -> 9152.52s]  I don't give a **** about anything else.
[9152.52s -> 9155.78s]  The very next day.
[9157.78s -> 9162.14s]  Here's the duck.
[9162.14s -> 9164.14s]  This is the duck's face.
[9164.14s -> 9166.14s]  Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
[9166.14s -> 9168.14s]  And I can't imagine improving on what's already
[9168.14s -> 9170.14s]  my most used kitchen helper.
[9170.14s -> 9172.14s]  But I've heard improvement is exactly
[9172.14s -> 9174.14s]  what's happened. And there's only one
[9174.14s -> 9176.14s]  person in the world who's qualified
[9176.14s -> 9178.14s]  to let us in on the news. So let's join
[9178.14s -> 9180.57s]  my friend, Jeremy Elbertson.
[9180.57s -> 9182.57s]  You're just a mean guy
[9182.57s -> 9184.57s]  who's got a bunch of TV shows.
[9184.57s -> 9186.57s]  You're just a mean guy who's got a bunch of TV shows
[9186.57s -> 9188.57s]  and I'm not going to stand for it.
[9188.57s -> 9193.24s]  Free me much from risotto
[9193.24s -> 9195.24s]  and you don't have a **** palette.
[9195.24s -> 9197.61s]  **** you.
[9197.61s -> 9200.86s]  Shut up.
[9200.86s -> 9202.86s]  Yeah.
[9202.86s -> 9205.03s]  You're dumb.
[9205.03s -> 9207.03s]  You're the dumbest one here.
[9207.03s -> 9209.03s]  Turn that off.
[9209.03s -> 9211.34s]  The smoke.
[9211.34s -> 9216.97s]  So much smoke.
[9216.97s -> 9220.02s]  Where's the meat grinder?
[9220.02s -> 9222.02s]  You're dead.
[9222.02s -> 9228.49s]  This is Lucio
[9228.49s -> 9230.49s]  Malfoyle teaches the dark arts.
[9230.49s -> 9242.14s]  The defense of the dark arts class.
[9242.14s -> 9245.72s]  My name is Lucio
[9245.72s -> 9248.02s]  Malfoyle. I'm the new teacher in
[9248.02s -> 9250.02s]  town.
[9250.02s -> 9252.46s]  If we could all open up
[9252.46s -> 9254.46s]  your textbooks and go to page
[9254.46s -> 9256.46s]  200, please.
[9256.46s -> 9259.13s]  We're going to be using...
[9259.13s -> 9261.13s]  Yes, yes.
[9261.13s -> 9263.13s]  Page 200, we're going to be making a frog
[9263.13s -> 9266.20s]  breath potion. You know
[9266.20s -> 9276.95s]  all about that? Open up your textbook.
[9276.95s -> 9280.28s]  Wait, aren't I supposed to be Lucius?
[9280.28s -> 9282.78s]  I'm in the middle
[9282.78s -> 9284.78s]  of teaching, Harry. That's not the time
[9284.78s -> 9290.02s]  to use that spell.
[9290.02s -> 9292.02s]  Oh, oh, I killed him.
[9292.02s -> 9294.02s]  I think I killed him. Didn't they ever
[9294.02s -> 9296.02s]  tell you you only use that
[9296.02s -> 9298.02s]  spell if you mean to kill another wizard?
[9298.02s -> 9300.78s]  Never use that
[9300.78s -> 9302.78s]  spell. The book can tie his backwards.
[9302.78s -> 9304.78s]  You can see the little slot.
[9304.78s -> 9306.78s]  You're going to be floating in the air. There he is.
[9306.78s -> 9311.05s]  Down.
[9311.05s -> 9313.05s]  He's swinging around, he's swinging around, he's swinging around.
[9313.05s -> 9315.61s]  Down. Never use that spell
[9315.61s -> 9321.37s]  in my classroom again.
[9321.37s -> 9323.37s]  Well, class, it's been a pleasure.
[9323.37s -> 9325.37s]  Absolute pleasure. But you
[9325.37s -> 9327.37s]  all don't
[9327.37s -> 9329.37s]  understand the power of the Dark Lord.
[9329.37s -> 9331.37s]  And for that reason, I'm out.
[9331.37s -> 9333.54s]  Just like that show,
[9333.54s -> 9341.99s]  Shark Tank. Dude, that's fail
[9341.99s -> 9343.99s]  RP. I'm calling an admin.
[9343.99s -> 9348.09s]  Yeah. Oh, nice
[9348.09s -> 9350.65s]  one, Harry.
[9350.65s -> 9362.49s]  Almost got me.
[9362.49s -> 9365.88s]  Hey, Harry. See you tomorrow on
[9365.88s -> 9368.25s]  potions class.
[9368.25s -> 9371.00s]  Hahahaha.
[9371.00s -> 9375.85s]  Hahahaha.
[9375.85s -> 9380.01s]  I figured I was going to be flying.
[9380.01s -> 9394.07s]  RDM.
[9394.07s -> 9396.07s]  Stop.
[9396.07s -> 9398.31s]  Criminal scum.
[9398.31s -> 9400.31s]  You violated the law.
[9400.31s -> 9402.62s]  You will pay in blood.
[9402.62s -> 9409.40s]  Let's go.
[9409.40s -> 9411.40s]  You're in trouble.
[9411.40s -> 9413.40s]  You're in trouble.
[9413.40s -> 9415.40s]  Stop.
[9415.40s -> 9417.40s]  Stop. Stop.
[9417.40s -> 9419.64s]  Stop.
[9419.64s -> 9421.64s]  Yes.
[9421.64s -> 9423.64s]  Yes.
[9423.64s -> 9431.00s]  Yes.
[9431.00s -> 9433.00s]  You know, I kind of hope this is the only playlist aliens find
[9433.00s -> 9435.00s]  in like a million years.
[9435.00s -> 9437.00s]  Don't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9437.00s -> 9439.30s]  That's what I hear. Shut up.
[9439.30s -> 9442.63s]  Shut up. Yeah.
[9442.63s -> 9444.63s]  Oh, yeah, yeah. Shut the fuck up.
[9444.63s -> 9446.94s]  Stupid. You're all stupid
[9446.94s -> 9448.94s]  idiots.
[9448.94s -> 9450.94s]  You're dumb.
[9450.94s -> 9452.94s]  You're the dumbest one here.
[9452.94s -> 9456.58s]  Yeah.
[9456.58s -> 9458.58s]  Turn that off. Turn that off. I'm shave Sean.
[9458.58s -> 9460.58s]  God damn it. I'm a different person now.
[9460.58s -> 9464.17s]  Turn that camera off. I learned this one when I
[9464.17s -> 9466.86s]  was traveling abroad.
[9466.86s -> 9476.33s]  It's so true though. It really is.
[9476.33s -> 9478.33s]  Dude, I'll fall asleep with autoplay in a Karen
[9478.33s -> 9480.33s]  video. We'll just play. And then somebody gets punched.
[9480.33s -> 9502.09s]  Life feeling empty.
[9502.09s -> 9504.09s]  Is joy no where to be found.
[9504.09s -> 9506.09s]  You need yourself a brand new set of
[9506.09s -> 9508.09s]  old tummy cowboy cookware.
[9508.09s -> 9511.86s]  Look at that value.
[9511.86s -> 9517.94s]  Order now.
[9517.94s -> 9528.38s]  Getting on free.
[9528.38s -> 9535.80s]  It's warm
[9535.80s -> 9540.41s]  It's warm in time.
[9540.41s -> 9547.06s]  How do you feel? How are you
[9547.06s -> 9549.75s]  doing? Oh my God.
[9549.75s -> 9558.71s]  Hello, patient. This is an ASI.
[9558.71s -> 9566.97s]  I can't do this.
[9566.97s -> 9569.46s]  How are you?
[9569.46s -> 9577.06s]  How are you feeling?
[9577.06s -> 9579.69s]  Hey.
[9581.86s -> 9595.46s]  No. Mine.
[9595.46s -> 9599.99s]  Oh.
[9599.99s -> 9609.77s]  Oh. Oh.
[9609.77s -> 9614.89s]  Jeans on. You're a found
[9614.89s -> 9649.13s]  footage. Uh oh.
[9649.13s -> 9651.13s]  Oh no.
[9651.13s -> 9654.65s]  Mario speedrun.
[9654.65s -> 9656.65s]  These are like my favorite by the way. I love these.
[9656.65s -> 9660.74s]  We did so much Mario
[9660.74s -> 9662.74s]  content. I'm so happy there's like
[9662.74s -> 9666.52s]  50 of these. 7 hours and
[9666.52s -> 9668.52s]  15 minutes. Holy shit. Okay. Let's see what happens.
[9668.52s -> 9680.54s]  I'm gonna burp.
[9680.54s -> 9696.46s]  Okie dokie.
[9696.46s -> 9707.66s]  Toaster goes in the
[9707.66s -> 9709.66s]  toaster. Toaster no.
[9709.66s -> 9711.66s]  Toaster goes in the toaster.
[9711.66s -> 9715.56s]  Bring your
[9715.56s -> 9719.91s]  arm.
[9719.91s -> 9721.91s]  Why would you do BLJs with 120
[9721.91s -> 9723.91s]  stars?
[9723.91s -> 9728.50s]  Fuck out of here.
[9728.50s -> 9730.50s]  Fuck down Bowser.
[9730.50s -> 9741.11s]  Flex yeah.
[9741.11s -> 9748.98s]  German 95 show.
[9748.98s -> 9778.23s]  On TV.
[9778.23s -> 9780.23s]  I'm on the television. Channel 2.
[9780.23s -> 9782.23s]  Bye.
[9782.23s -> 9784.60s]  Pasta tonight.
[9784.60s -> 9786.60s]  Alright. Yeah. We're gonna play a new song.
[9786.60s -> 9788.60s]  This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[9788.60s -> 9790.60s]  I hope you all enjoy it.
[9790.60s -> 9792.60s]  It doesn't have a name. It's currently
[9792.60s -> 9794.60s]  untitled so.
[9794.60s -> 9796.60s]  That's what we're gonna do. It's an untitled song.
[9796.60s -> 9798.60s]  And I hope you enjoy it.
[9798.60s -> 9838.84s]  Oh. Please clap.
[9838.84s -> 9842.49s]  Thank you. Thank you so much.
[9842.49s -> 9865.51s]  No. It was scary.
[9865.51s -> 9867.51s]  Oh come on.
[9867.51s -> 9869.51s]  Bowser.
[9869.51s -> 9872.20s]  I know what to do.
[9872.20s -> 9881.66s]  Tell you to take drugs.
[9881.66s -> 9883.66s]  Always say no.
[9883.66s -> 9885.66s]  My brother Luigi would also say this too.
[9885.66s -> 9887.66s]  We both would say this.
[9887.66s -> 9889.66s]  You don't have to do them. Don't get the pressure to take drugs
[9889.66s -> 9891.66s]  or drink. If anyone ever pressures you
[9891.66s -> 9893.66s]  tell them Mario said if you do drugs
[9893.66s -> 9895.66s]  you'll end up like Pikachu over there.
[9904.74s -> 9909.35s]  Somebody definitely got a bingo right now.
[9909.35s -> 9912.04s]  You've been waiting for the Jojo
[9912.04s -> 9916.89s]  intro. Bingo. Bingo.
[9932.92s -> 9976.89s]  Damn.
[9976.89s -> 10005.69s]  That was damn good.
[10005.69s -> 10013.54s]  It was.
[10013.54s -> 10024.68s]  Awesome.
[10024.68s -> 10026.68s]  All of these have been absolute
[10026.68s -> 10030.97s]  complete bangers.
[10030.97s -> 10034.87s]  Do not plank the blank.
[10034.87s -> 10041.91s]  Okay. I'll voice the subtitle.
[10041.91s -> 10043.91s]  Records of the simulation of the target's memory.
[10043.91s -> 10045.91s]  Advise watch with at least three trained
[10045.91s -> 10047.91s]  agents. Watcher must avoid...
[10047.91s -> 10050.73s]  Okay. I'll do it.
[10050.73s -> 10053.42s]  Oh my fucking
[10053.42s -> 10055.42s]  god. I thought that was in real life.
[10055.42s -> 10058.36s]  Was that in real life? What the fuck? That was in real life.
[10058.36s -> 10061.43s]  Why?
[10061.43s -> 10067.00s]  Was that in real life?
[10067.00s -> 10071.61s]  Okay. What the? Come on.
[10071.61s -> 10073.61s]  Jesus. Oh my god.
[10073.61s -> 10082.25s]  Stop doing that.
[10082.25s -> 10089.72s]  Stop it.
[10108.36s -> 10110.36s]  Turn on captions?
[10112.36s -> 10114.36s]  I think we can hear it.
[10114.36s -> 10132.20s]  Should I do it?
[10132.20s -> 10136.55s]  I'm about to turn off the TV.
[10150.55s -> 10152.55s]  People are too high for this.
[10152.55s -> 10156.58s]  Oh.
[10162.58s -> 10165.78s]  It's ruining the video.
[10165.78s -> 10167.78s]  God damn it. No.
[10167.78s -> 10176.28s]  Who's knocking at this time?
[10176.28s -> 10178.28s]  I gotta calm down.
[10178.28s -> 10182.82s]  That was just a dream.
[10182.82s -> 10186.86s]  I am coming. Sorry. You can come back tomorrow.
[10186.86s -> 10190.76s]  Maybe. Maybe next time.
[10190.76s -> 10194.22s]  What a weird guy. What the fuck?
[10194.22s -> 10197.99s]  Wait. Hold on. I feel like I've
[10197.99s -> 10201.51s]  seen that guy before. I'm keeping all
[10201.51s -> 10203.51s]  my lights on tonight. I'm keeping the
[10203.51s -> 10207.35s]  lights on.
[10207.35s -> 10209.98s]  What the fuck is that noise?
[10209.98s -> 10211.98s]  Someone trying to break in. I'm leaving this fucking
[10211.98s -> 10214.86s]  house right now.
[10214.86s -> 10219.83s]  I need to get the fuck out of here.
[10219.83s -> 10233.45s]  You got me.
[10233.45s -> 10235.82s]  That was very well made, by the way.
[10235.82s -> 10241.13s]  NeuroStory pizza floor.
[10241.13s -> 10243.88s]  What is it? German? NeuroStory pizza
[10243.88s -> 10249.77s]  floor, chef.
[10249.77s -> 10270.87s]  Baseball ass.
[10270.87s -> 10273.62s]  Hi, boys and girls. I'm Jeremy Alphaxson.
[10273.62s -> 10275.93s]  I have to reel it in
[10275.93s -> 10277.93s]  in 2022.
[10277.93s -> 10279.93s]  You know, it's not Yahoo. True.
[10279.93s -> 10281.93s]  It's not cool. Baseball
[10281.93s -> 10285.00s]  ass.
[10285.00s -> 10293.56s]  I feel like I hit my head.
[10293.56s -> 10298.55s]  Is that the law and order sound?
[10298.55s -> 10310.97s]  What's happening?
[10310.97s -> 10314.81s]  Where am I?
[10314.81s -> 10317.56s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[10317.56s -> 10321.40s]  Hi, Bob.
[10321.40s -> 10324.28s]  Hey, Bob. I'm on TV. I'm sorry.
[10324.28s -> 10326.28s]  I'm sorry. Can I have the mic?
[10326.28s -> 10328.28s]  No, you don't have to do that.
[10328.28s -> 10335.24s]  Channel 2.
[10335.24s -> 10346.81s]  I'll leave. I'll leave.
[10346.81s -> 10350.01s]  Funny stuff. You did this.
[10350.01s -> 10353.34s]  You did this.
[10353.34s -> 10355.34s]  And you can fix it too.
[10355.34s -> 10362.36s]  You're a real piece of work.
[10362.36s -> 10364.60s]  You know what? I can't even
[10364.60s -> 10366.60s]  say it to you, but you know what I was going to say.
[10366.60s -> 10369.59s]  I was going to say
[10369.59s -> 10375.42s]  forget me.
[10375.42s -> 10378.68s]  So stupid.
[10398.84s -> 10401.02s]  God damn it. German auto
[10401.02s -> 10412.28s]  C adventure.
[10412.28s -> 10417.27s]  They're going to think I'm crazy.
[10417.27s -> 10419.27s]  Don't splash people.
[10423.83s -> 10429.02s]  Yes.
[10429.02s -> 10431.02s]  Terminati.
[10431.02s -> 10433.02s]  Thank you.
[10433.02s -> 10439.67s]  Good.
[10439.67s -> 10441.67s]  Hit him in the head. I don't care.
[10446.42s -> 10455.00s]  Oh, my God.
[10455.00s -> 10459.22s]  What I get.
[10459.22s -> 10462.86s]  Oh, that's a big
[10462.86s -> 10464.86s]  one. I'll take a picture of that.
[10464.86s -> 10470.10s]  I'll get one more out there.
[10479.96s -> 10482.20s]  What was that?
[10482.20s -> 10484.20s]  What the fuck was that?
[10484.20s -> 10486.20s]  We play at night. We stalk at night.
[10486.20s -> 10488.20s]  We're the rats.
[10488.20s -> 10490.20s]  What the? I don't know what that was,
[10490.20s -> 10492.20s]  but it was weird. I'm the giant
[10492.20s -> 10494.20s]  rat that makes all of
[10494.20s -> 10496.20s]  the rules. You want to duel?
[10496.20s -> 10498.20s]  You and me.
[10503.45s -> 10505.45s]  Come on. Easy. Easy.
[10505.45s -> 10507.45s]  Come on. Do it already. Come on. Come at me.
[10512.82s -> 10514.82s]  What the hell was that?
[10514.82s -> 10525.69s]  Auto.
[10525.69s -> 10531.43s]  Look at auto. That one was great.
[10549.61s -> 10559.34s]  What's your name?
[10559.34s -> 10563.69s]  That's so horrifying.
[10563.69s -> 10575.77s]  What's your name?
[10575.77s -> 10580.25s]  Quiet.
[10580.25s -> 10582.25s]  Here comes the car.
[10582.25s -> 10584.25s]  You're dumb?
[10584.25s -> 10586.25s]  You're the dumbest one here.
[10586.25s -> 10590.47s]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[10590.47s -> 10593.10s]  Shut the fuck up.
[10593.10s -> 10595.10s]  Those pants. Hey, are you ready?
[10595.10s -> 10597.10s]  Follow me up to the office and they'll
[10597.10s -> 10599.85s]  finish your release.
[10599.85s -> 10601.85s]  Fuck you. Fucking hell. You see what I got
[10601.85s -> 10617.66s]  dealing with back here?
[10617.66s -> 10619.66s]  You were talking about me and my kingdom.
[10619.66s -> 10621.66s]  Just a little too, a little too harsh.
[10621.66s -> 10624.02s]  I don't like
[10624.02s -> 10626.39s]  you much.
[10626.39s -> 10629.46s]  This was welded with
[10629.46s -> 10631.46s]  dragon bone. I really don't
[10631.46s -> 10633.46s]  want you around here. You want to duel?
[10633.46s -> 10635.46s]  You and me. Dragon
[10635.46s -> 10637.46s]  bone steel. You don't deserve
[10637.46s -> 10640.15s]  to live.
[10662.81s -> 10665.11s]  Hey, look, bud. I'm an engineer.
[10665.11s -> 10667.11s]  That means I solve problems.
[10667.11s -> 10669.11s]  I solve practical problems.
[10669.11s -> 10671.48s]  Teleporter going up.
[10671.48s -> 10676.20s]  Ow.
[10676.20s -> 10679.02s]  My leg. Mission begins
[10679.02s -> 10684.39s]  in the century. Going up.
[10684.39s -> 10689.51s]  Good night, Irene.
[10696.10s -> 10700.07s]  You know, building centuries
[10700.07s -> 10702.07s]  sure is tough work. A lot of people
[10702.07s -> 10704.07s]  don't realize the amount of
[10704.07s -> 10706.07s]  craftsmanship that goes into making one
[10706.07s -> 10708.07s]  of these things. You need the right kind of aluminum
[10708.07s -> 10710.07s]  alloy metal. That takes a while to get
[10710.07s -> 10712.07s]  and it's very stressful. Look at that. You got all
[10712.07s -> 10714.07s]  kinds of scouts fucking with you. Can't you see
[10714.07s -> 10716.07s]  how busy I am right now?
[10716.07s -> 10719.53s]  Sensor down.
[10719.53s -> 10725.03s]  Ah.
[10725.03s -> 10731.05s]  Victory.
[10731.05s -> 10740.90s]  Hey. Hey, what's up? How are you?
[10740.90s -> 10744.30s]  I just moved in. Yep. New to
[10744.30s -> 10746.73s]  the neighborhood. Me. I love your
[10746.73s -> 10749.29s]  house. I love what you're doing here.
[10749.29s -> 10751.29s]  You know what I mean? I love this house. What's that?
[10751.29s -> 10753.53s]  Really, really beautiful lawn you have,
[10753.53s -> 10755.83s]  too. Yeah. I got kids.
[10755.83s -> 10758.14s]  Yeah, we all get kids, right?
[10758.14s -> 10760.14s]  Look, if you ever, um,
[10760.14s -> 10762.14s]  it might sound weird, but if you ever want to hang out
[10762.14s -> 10764.14s]  and just kind of do something, just you and me or whatever,
[10764.14s -> 10766.14s]  we have to get the families together.
[10766.14s -> 10768.14s]  Like, I would just come over. I would come over. I would come in
[10768.14s -> 10770.14s]  your house. I would come over your house.
[10770.14s -> 10772.14s]  And you'd let me in, right? Like, I would
[10772.14s -> 10774.14s]  come over. We'd do a thing. Would you be interested?
[10774.14s -> 10776.44s]  Okay.
[10776.44s -> 10778.44s]  Okay.
[10778.44s -> 10780.44s]  Can get some mojitos.
[10780.44s -> 10782.44s]  It's like a purge movie.
[10782.44s -> 10784.44s]  You don't understand. It's so good.
[10784.44s -> 10786.44s]  You know the trick for a mojito?
[10786.44s -> 10788.44s]  Extra mint.
[10788.44s -> 10790.44s]  People don't like
[10790.44s -> 10792.44s]  the taste of mint usually. Can I come in?
[10792.44s -> 10795.19s]  Can I just come in?
[10795.19s -> 10797.19s]  Okay. Yeah, but I mean, I could show you how to make a mojito
[10797.19s -> 10799.19s]  the right way and not like
[10799.19s -> 10801.19s]  the way that everybody else makes it without the extra mint.
[10801.19s -> 10803.19s]  I have to come in though. Can I come in your house?
[10842.52s -> 10845.53s]  Nice netcode.
[10845.53s -> 10847.53s]  Anybody else have something to say?
[10847.53s -> 10855.85s]  Very interesting.
[10855.85s -> 10860.06s]  Are you ready? Yeah.
[10878.49s -> 10890.33s]  God.
[10890.33s -> 10894.10s]  They put something in it to make you forget.
[10894.10s -> 10896.47s]  I don't even remember how I got here.
[10896.47s -> 10898.47s]  I've been drinking water out of the sink.
[10898.47s -> 10900.47s]  This whole time.
[10900.47s -> 10902.47s]  Like, literally like drinking the toilet.
[10902.47s -> 10904.47s]  Like the water in the toilet.
[10904.47s -> 10906.47s]  They have like a water thing
[10906.47s -> 10908.47s]  here.
[10908.47s -> 10916.15s]  Like in the other room.
[10916.15s -> 10919.61s]  Sure. You're a scientist.
[10919.61s -> 10922.68s]  Pick up that can.
[10922.68s -> 10924.68s]  I said pick up the can.
[10924.68s -> 10926.68s]  I'm something of a scientist myself.
[10926.68s -> 10928.68s]  You have no compliance with it.
[10930.68s -> 10934.84s]  Whoa!
[10938.23s -> 10942.07s]  This water is
[10942.07s -> 10944.07s]  so dirty.
[10944.07s -> 10946.07s]  Don't splash me.
[10946.07s -> 10948.07s]  Don't splash me.
[10948.07s -> 10950.07s]  Throw him out.
[10955.45s -> 10961.72s]  I love your house.
[10961.72s -> 10963.72s]  I love what you do in here.
[10967.18s -> 10972.17s]  I didn't do it.
[10972.17s -> 10974.17s]  Really, really beautiful lawn you have.
[10974.17s -> 10984.73s]  Good. Stop.
[10984.73s -> 10988.12s]  Slow down.
[10988.12s -> 10990.12s]  I'm going to have to take off a few points without
[10990.12s -> 10995.82s]  what that was.
[10995.82s -> 10997.82s]  Stop sign. Stop sign.
[10997.82s -> 10999.82s]  Stop sign.
[10999.82s -> 11001.82s]  Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
[11001.82s -> 11003.82s]  Stop sign. Stop sign.
[11003.82s -> 11007.98s]  Do you see what's in front of us?
[11007.98s -> 11009.98s]  You do, right? What's in front of us?
[11009.98s -> 11020.09s]  You're pretty dumb.
[11020.09s -> 11022.09s]  Can I just tell you? You're dumb.
[11022.09s -> 11024.09s]  What was that? No human drives a car
[11024.09s -> 11026.09s]  like this. I hate coming out here
[11026.09s -> 11028.09s]  with bugs everywhere. I don't like when the bugs are everywhere.
[11030.58s -> 11032.58s]  I can tolerate them when they're in small doses.
[11032.58s -> 11035.14s]  But, dude, is
[11035.14s -> 11037.14s]  there something on me? Is there something on my back?
[11037.14s -> 11039.14s]  Is there something on my back? Just tell me. Get it.
[11039.14s -> 11041.14s]  Get it. Get it. Dude, get it.
[11041.14s -> 11043.14s]  By don't move, it won't
[11043.14s -> 11046.92s]  see me. Clear!
[11046.92s -> 11055.18s]  Sent her down!
[11055.18s -> 11057.18s]  You got something to say?
[11061.78s -> 11070.73s]  That was awesome.
[11070.73s -> 11073.42s]  That was fucking awesome.
[11073.42s -> 11075.42s]  Germa and the Germas.
[11075.42s -> 11077.42s]  Untitled bug song.
[11077.42s -> 11083.30s]  We got another band video. People are utilizing
[11083.30s -> 11085.30s]  the driving instructor very well.
[11085.30s -> 11092.60s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.
[11092.60s -> 11095.21s]  Thanks for coming out. Yeah.
[11095.21s -> 11097.21s]  We got a new song that we're going to play for you here.
[11097.21s -> 11102.20s]  I think I just dropped a jam out of my pocket.
[11102.20s -> 11104.20s]  Maybe I should trade this.
[11104.20s -> 11106.20s]  Alright, yeah. We're going to play a new song.
[11106.20s -> 11108.20s]  This one is something we've been working on for a long time.
[11108.20s -> 11110.20s]  I hope you all enjoy it.
[11110.20s -> 11112.20s]  It doesn't have a name. It's currently untitled.
[11112.20s -> 11114.20s]  So, that's what
[11114.20s -> 11116.20s]  we're going to do. It's an untitled song and I hope you enjoy it.
[11116.20s -> 11118.44s]  Maybe you can help us come up with a title
[11118.44s -> 11120.44s]  after the end of the show.
[11120.44s -> 11123.26s]  It's going to be peppy. It's going to be a lot of upbeat.
[11123.26s -> 11125.26s]  So, hopefully see somebody out there dancing.
[11125.26s -> 11128.65s]  Okay? And a one,
[11128.65s -> 11130.65s]  two, a one, two, three,
[11130.65s -> 11135.51s]  four. Uh-oh.
[11135.51s -> 11156.63s]  Here we go.
[11156.63s -> 11158.63s]  Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.
[11158.63s -> 11160.63s]  Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.
[11160.63s -> 11162.63s]  Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.
[11162.63s -> 11164.63s]  Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.
[11164.63s -> 11221.40s]  That was crazy.
[11221.40s -> 11224.41s]  The songs have been
[11224.41s -> 11226.41s]  just so good.
[11226.41s -> 11229.22s]  They've been fantastic.
[11251.27s -> 11256.58s]  Walking through the woods.
[11256.58s -> 11262.09s]  Is this another real one?
[11262.09s -> 11311.43s]  With real actors?
[11311.43s -> 11345.02s]  Oh my god.
[11345.02s -> 11348.09s]  This is terrifying.
[11348.09s -> 11350.09s]  This show is brought to you by Grotto Beasts.
[11350.09s -> 11352.09s]  The exciting new trading card
[11352.09s -> 11354.09s]  game coming soon.
[11354.09s -> 11356.09s]  And now, a word from our
[11356.09s -> 11358.26s]  sponsors.
[11358.26s -> 11363.70s]  Are you ready?
[11363.70s -> 11366.26s]  Road Wireless Goes.
[11366.26s -> 11368.26s]  These things are fucking awesome.
[11368.26s -> 11370.26s]  They're so little.
[11370.26s -> 11372.26s]  You get two.
[11372.26s -> 11374.26s]  You can plug other shit into here too.
[11374.26s -> 11377.98s]  This is a scientist.
[11377.98s -> 11379.98s]  This is a real scientist.
[11379.98s -> 11381.98s]  This is a real scientist working
[11381.98s -> 11383.98s]  as a senior scientist at Road
[11383.98s -> 11385.98s]  Laboratories.
[11385.98s -> 11387.98s]  We at Road Laboratories A,

[11389.98s -> 11391.98s]  experience for all gamers.

[11397.98s -> 11399.98s]  usability and comfort such as
[11399.98s -> 11401.98s]  shock absorbency.
[11401.98s -> 11403.98s]  I'm gonna scream in your ears.
[11403.98s -> 11406.15s]  Hey whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!
[11406.15s -> 11408.15s]  Noise compression.
[11408.15s -> 11410.15s]  And fashion.
[11410.15s -> 11412.15s]  All combined to give you the clearest,
[11412.15s -> 11414.15s]  pleasing sound possible.
[11414.15s -> 11416.65s]  But wait.
[11416.65s -> 11418.65s]  I know you're probably asking.
[11418.65s -> 11420.65s]  How much?
[11420.65s -> 11422.65s]  For the low low price of three money.
[11422.65s -> 11424.65s]  Wow!
[11424.65s -> 11426.65s]  Of course, I don't hate microphones.
[11426.65s -> 11428.65s]  I like microphones if they're
[11428.65s -> 11430.65s]  Road Wireless Go
[11430.65s -> 11432.65s]  2. The best microphones.
[11432.65s -> 11435.21s]  Am I okay?
[11435.21s -> 11456.38s]  Besides the fact that
[11456.38s -> 11458.68s]  first, be aware.
[11471.77s -> 11474.07s]  Hey, are you ready?
[11474.07s -> 11476.89s]  Are you ready? You don't look ready.
[11476.89s -> 11480.33s]  You know, this was welded
[11480.33s -> 11488.46s]  with Dragonbone.
[11488.46s -> 11491.59s]  Oh shit, okay, yep.
[11491.59s -> 11494.92s]  Something so simple as to go to a hotel room.
[11494.92s -> 11524.68s]  Two, three,
[11524.68s -> 11531.78s]  two, three,
[11531.78s -> 11534.66s]  two, three,
[11534.66s -> 11537.61s]  three!
[11537.61s -> 11542.22s]  Yeah, yeah, I'm up.
[11542.22s -> 11552.90s]  What's that on TV?
[11552.90s -> 11555.40s]  Oh shit!
[11555.40s -> 11557.40s]  It's fast German purple alien.
[11557.40s -> 11561.99s]  German purple alien.
[11561.99s -> 11564.36s]  Hey!
[11564.36s -> 11568.14s]  Hey!
[11568.14s -> 11571.85s]  Put it all again, Steve.
[11571.85s -> 11573.85s]  Why does that scare me so much?
[11573.85s -> 11575.85s]  To which we added the world's finest
[11575.85s -> 11577.85s]  resort facilities, a spectacular
[11577.85s -> 11579.85s]  amusement park, and succulent
[11579.85s -> 11581.85s]  seafood.
[11581.85s -> 11584.54s]  If you ever pressure, drugs,
[11584.54s -> 11586.54s]  alcohol, anything naughty
[11586.54s -> 11588.54s]  at all, say no.
[11588.54s -> 11605.80s]  Uh oh. Wait, what?
[11605.80s -> 11608.68s]  I have to choose it?
[11608.68s -> 11610.68s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, I have to actually choose
[11610.68s -> 11613.62s]  the video. Okay, hold on. I don't want
[11613.62s -> 11617.08s]  to spoil this. I gotta make sure I keep my place
[11617.08s -> 11620.84s]  here. I'm going yes. Hold on. I don't want
[11620.84s -> 11622.84s]  to spoil anything, but I don't want to lose my
[11622.84s -> 11636.95s]  place. One sec. Okay.
[11636.95s -> 11645.14s]  This is yes.
[11645.14s -> 11663.94s]  Alright!
[11663.94s -> 11669.77s]  Okay!
[11669.77s -> 11672.33s]  What? Oh, okay.
[11672.33s -> 11684.60s]  Alright, let's see what no is.
[11684.60s -> 11692.54s]  So this is no.
[11723.30s -> 11727.40s]  Oh my god.
[11727.40s -> 11732.01s]  What is that picture even from?
[11732.01s -> 11734.25s]  What's that picture from?
[11734.25s -> 11741.78s]  This one here. Is that even my face?
[11741.78s -> 11747.16s]  I don't even think this is my face.
[11747.16s -> 11759.37s]  Go on up next. He's logged into second
[11759.37s -> 11761.37s]  German, not the main channel.
[11767.05s -> 11769.05s]  You violated the law.
[11769.05s -> 11781.14s]  Finally, somebody has the lightsaber.
[11781.14s -> 11783.45s]  Guilty gear strive
[11783.45s -> 11785.45s]  German DLC.
[11823.27s -> 11825.27s]  It's woman's rights.
[11871.74s -> 11875.83s]  German F5 eye-witness museum intro.
[11875.83s -> 11879.54s]  What the hell is this?
[11879.54s -> 11906.17s]  Oh my god.
[11906.17s -> 11910.46s]  That was amazing.
[11910.46s -> 11912.89s]  Hold on a second here.
[11912.89s -> 11915.45s]  Cartwheel Jerma and Orange Troglodyte battle
[11915.45s -> 11919.80s]  for the origin mirror. This is a shortened
[11919.80s -> 11921.80s]  fight scene from a longer video. It's from a
[11921.80s -> 11923.80s]  dumb meme series I've run over the last two
[11923.80s -> 11925.80s]  years called Cartwheel Jerma
[11925.80s -> 11928.62s]  and, yep, wait, hold on.
[11928.62s -> 11935.66s]  This is the, oh, this is the spinoff.
[11935.66s -> 11937.66s]  Right, this is the spinoff series
[11937.66s -> 11939.83s]  from Fast Jerma and Purple Alien.
[11939.83s -> 11949.54s]  Well, let's see.
[11951.54s -> 11953.54s]  What the?
[11965.27s -> 11967.27s]  What the?
[11982.25s -> 11987.10s]  Holy shit.
[11987.10s -> 12042.39s]  God damn.
[12042.39s -> 12074.14s]  Gonna need a health potion after
[12074.14s -> 12076.14s]  that one.
[12082.60s -> 12084.60s]  Holy shit.
[12107.51s -> 12119.02s]  Holy shit.
[12119.02s -> 12121.02s]  Oh my god, that was
[12121.02s -> 12132.86s]  fucking believable. That truly
[12132.86s -> 12136.06s]  was remarkable. Nice fucking
[12136.06s -> 12138.06s]  job. Holy smokes.
[12138.06s -> 12143.93s]  I tell you, when
[12143.93s -> 12147.45s]  we do Encore Night, well,
[12147.45s -> 12150.78s]  part two or whatever, we're gonna have to check out
[12150.78s -> 12153.40s]  some more of the Cartwheel Jerma
[12153.40s -> 12157.74s]  series. That was awesome. Good show.
[12192.14s -> 12194.82s]  No human drives a car
[12194.82s -> 12196.82s]  like this. No human.
[12196.82s -> 12198.82s]  You could get a chimpanzee in this car and you'd probably
[12198.82s -> 12200.82s]  do better than the test than you did.
[12200.82s -> 12203.06s]  Do you see what's in front of us? You do, right?
[12203.06s -> 12205.06s]  What's in front of us?
[12205.06s -> 12207.06s]  Stop sign, stop sign, stop sign, stop sign.
[12207.06s -> 12210.39s]  Keep going.
[12210.39s -> 12212.39s]  Over here, parallel park in this spot
[12212.39s -> 12214.39s]  right here. There's two spots available. Not the one
[12214.39s -> 12216.39s]  in front of the red truck. The one behind it.
[12216.39s -> 12219.34s]  Behind the red truck.
[12219.34s -> 12221.90s]  Use your eyes.
[12221.90s -> 12224.58s]  Do you want these? Right there,
[12224.58s -> 12226.58s]  parallel park behind the red truck.
[12226.58s -> 12228.58s]  I'm not gonna say it another time.
[12228.58s -> 12230.58s]  Get up there in parallel park.
[12230.58s -> 12234.30s]  You just hit, you hit
[12234.30s -> 12236.30s]  it. You hit it. You bumped his
[12236.30s -> 12238.30s]  bumper. Okay.
[12238.30s -> 12241.56s]  That's gonna get you two grades off, I think.
[12241.56s -> 12243.56s]  You're not getting your license today, by the way.
[12243.56s -> 12246.18s]  That very clear.
[12246.18s -> 12248.18s]  We sat down?
[12248.18s -> 12251.45s]  My name is
[12251.45s -> 12255.85s]  Sean, okay? That's what you
[12255.85s -> 12257.85s]  can call me now. Not angry
[12257.85s -> 12259.85s]  mustache guy that you see on
[12259.85s -> 12263.42s]  YouTube. Sean.
[12263.42s -> 12265.42s]  I'm very sorry. I'm incredibly
[12265.42s -> 12269.77s]  sorry. You want more than that?
[12269.77s -> 12272.39s]  That's all I'm gonna give you. I'm gonna go back
[12272.39s -> 12274.39s]  to being a good person. You just
[12274.39s -> 12276.76s]  wait. Good person Sean is
[12276.76s -> 12278.76s]  what you'll call me. Not this. I'm shaving
[12278.76s -> 12280.76s]  this. Good person Sean is coming
[12280.76s -> 12290.04s]  up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12290.04s -> 12292.60s]  That's what I hear. Shut up. Shut
[12292.60s -> 12295.16s]  up. Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
[12295.16s -> 12298.23s]  Shut the fuck up. Stupid.
[12298.23s -> 12300.23s]  You're all stupid idiots.
[12300.23s -> 12302.47s]  You're dumb?
[12302.47s -> 12304.71s]  You're the dumbest one here. Yeah.
[12304.71s -> 12308.36s]  No, no, no, no. Turn that off.
[12308.36s -> 12310.36s]  Turn that off. I'm shaved Sean, god
[12310.36s -> 12312.36s]  damn it. No, I'm a different person now. Turn that camera
[12312.36s -> 12316.78s]  off. Somebody used it. Somebody actually
[12316.78s -> 12318.78s]  used it.
[12318.78s -> 12352.44s]  Dude, I just got
[12352.44s -> 12354.44s]  a warning on my Twitch dashboard
[12354.44s -> 12356.44s]  that said there's a copyrighted song.
[12356.44s -> 12359.32s]  That's what triggered it. This whole stream.
[12359.32s -> 12389.38s]  Oh my god.
[12389.38s -> 12391.38s]  Alright, time for another pee break. I'm gonna get a drink.
[12391.38s -> 12394.39s]  I'll be back in like two minutes, three minutes.
[12394.39s -> 12397.08s]  I think we are, we're getting
[12397.08s -> 12399.08s]  close to a little bit more than the halfway point.
[12399.08s -> 12402.02s]  I think a little bit more than that. I want to see
[12402.02s -> 12405.74s]  how many we have left. My whole body
[12405.74s -> 12414.25s]  hurts by the way. Let's see. No
[12414.25s -> 12419.69s]  spoilers, no spoilers.
[12419.69s -> 12422.82s]  We have crossed the halfway point
[12422.82s -> 12425.13s]  and we've got a solid
[12425.13s -> 12434.34s]  another probably hour or two left.
[12434.34s -> 12436.34s]  This has been absolutely
[12436.34s -> 12438.34s]  hysterical though. These have been some of the highest
[12438.34s -> 12440.34s]  quality things we've seen
[12440.34s -> 12443.86s]  at least in the last three or four years.
[12443.86s -> 12447.83s]  My whole body is aching. My face
[12447.83s -> 12451.74s]  hurts. Real voice.
[12451.74s -> 12454.42s]  Alright, I'll be right back. Give me like two minutes, three minutes.
[12454.42s -> 12839.35s]  Okay, we're back.
[12839.35s -> 12841.72s]  So we're gonna, I'm probably gonna go for like another hour.
[12841.72s -> 12844.15s]  Hour and 25 minutes maybe.
[12844.15s -> 12847.48s]  Do like another 30, 40.
[12847.48s -> 12851.32s]  There's so much here.
[12851.32s -> 12853.32s]  I'm definitely hitting that point where I've been
[12853.32s -> 12855.69s]  laughing and fucking just choking back
[12855.69s -> 12859.66s]  here for the last three and a half hours.
[12859.66s -> 12862.73s]  God. Okay.
[12862.73s -> 12864.90s]  Let's go to the home stretch. It will
[12864.90s -> 12867.78s]  be a part two, don't worry.
[12867.78s -> 12869.78s]  There were 800 videos guys
[12869.78s -> 12872.09s]  and we're not gonna show them all.
[12872.09s -> 12874.09s]  We'll absolutely get through at least
[12874.09s -> 12876.58s]  two, three, four hundred of these.
[12876.58s -> 12880.74s]  I would imagine. There's just too much good
[12880.74s -> 12885.98s]  content. Okay, let's get
[12885.98s -> 12891.86s]  back to it. I just double tapped the screen
[12891.86s -> 12898.39s]  to skip the pee break.
[12898.39s -> 12900.39s]  Alright, let's keep going.
[12900.39s -> 12911.21s]  Let's get another solid hour or two in here.

[12914.15s -> 12926.81s]  CSGO tactic.
[12942.42s -> 12945.18s]  I've done this before.
[12945.18s -> 12947.18s]  Absolute perfection.
[12947.18s -> 12949.18s]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[12949.18s -> 12957.62s]  Fucking Wizard of Oz.
[12981.35s -> 13000.74s]  Oh, you wanna fight?
[13000.74s -> 13002.74s]  Don't fuck with that.
[13002.74s -> 13015.14s]  We're three.
[13015.14s -> 13017.14s]  We're all gonna put our guns down.
[13017.14s -> 13019.14s]  You think you can do me?
[13019.14s -> 13021.14s]  Stupid.
[13021.14s -> 13023.70s]  One, two,
[13023.70s -> 13025.70s]  three.
[13025.70s -> 13028.39s]  Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.
[13028.39s -> 13040.34s]  Hey.
[13040.34s -> 13044.06s]  You're going down.
[13044.06s -> 13047.06s]  Sun fact.

[13050.84s -> 13053.02s]  Bomb has been planted.
[13053.02s -> 13080.46s]  It's not there.
[13080.46s -> 13085.62s]  Where is it?
[13085.62s -> 13087.62s]  I got it.
[13087.62s -> 13093.19s]  Terrorists win.
[13093.19s -> 13095.19s]  I love this part.
[13095.19s -> 13097.75s]  Coming up here.
[13097.75s -> 13099.75s]  We need ten seconds after
[13099.75s -> 13105.38s]  that one.
[13105.38s -> 13120.15s]  That was very, very good.
[13120.15s -> 13122.15s]  Well done. That was very, very fun.
[13122.15s -> 13126.44s]  This is super Jerma rumble
[13126.44s -> 13129.90s]  melee. Let's check it out.
[13129.90s -> 13144.98s]  Fuck you.
[13144.98s -> 13186.38s]  Burn in
[13186.38s -> 13214.98s]  smoke.
[13214.98s -> 13223.56s]  This is terrible.
[13223.56s -> 13225.56s]  Imagine an earwig looking up at you
[13225.56s -> 13227.56s]  and he's like
[13227.56s -> 13231.34s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13231.34s -> 13234.02s]  Everybody hold on a second.
[13234.02s -> 13236.82s]  Didn't we talk about this
[13236.82s -> 13239.77s]  like three days ago?
[13239.77s -> 13244.38s]  Like four days ago? Did you do this in
[13244.38s -> 13246.87s]  one day? One day?
[13246.87s -> 13251.35s]  At the deadline?
[13251.35s -> 13253.35s]  Holy shit. What?
[13253.35s -> 13255.35s]  You did this in like four hours?
[13255.35s -> 13260.01s]  Okay. Well, let's go.
[13260.01s -> 13262.01s]  Imagine an earwig looking up at you
[13262.01s -> 13267.32s]  and he's like, and I'm like, oh, get the
[13267.32s -> 13269.32s]  envelope. Save him.
[13269.32s -> 13271.32s]  And I get the envelope and I get him
[13271.32s -> 13273.32s]  on the envelope and I put him outside. And then the
[13273.32s -> 13275.32s]  next day, it's like three that you see.
[13275.32s -> 13277.32s]  And you're like, oh, wow, cool.
[13277.32s -> 13279.32s]  Let's save these three. To the same
[13279.32s -> 13282.46s]  fucking soundtrack.
[13282.46s -> 13284.46s]  Oh, save us.
[13284.46s -> 13286.70s]  Here come another
[13286.70s -> 13289.45s]  50 in your house.
[13289.45s -> 13291.45s]  And they're all dancing in a line.
[13291.45s -> 13293.45s]  Doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna,
[13293.45s -> 13295.45s]  two antenna, top hat, top hat,
[13295.45s -> 13297.45s]  top hat. It's like, well, 50 earwigs.
[13297.45s -> 13299.45s]  Oh my god, they're so cute. Get the envelope.
[13299.45s -> 13301.45s]  They all start crawling on it.
[13301.45s -> 13303.45s]  You get them out, you save them, save the
[13303.45s -> 13306.01s]  earwigs. And then
[13306.01s -> 13308.01s]  me lying down in bed three
[13308.01s -> 13310.01s]  days later. I'm drifting off to
[13310.01s -> 13312.01s]  sleep.
[13312.01s -> 13314.01s]  What a nice day that was today.
[13314.01s -> 13316.31s]  The second that I fall asleep
[13316.31s -> 13318.31s]  and I go into REM, they can sense it.
[13318.31s -> 13320.31s]  And two thousand earwigs
[13320.31s -> 13322.31s]  just make a trail up the bed
[13322.31s -> 13324.31s]  and just go into my brain
[13324.31s -> 13326.31s]  to this music. And they all
[13326.31s -> 13328.31s]  going in, digging in, like
[13328.31s -> 13330.31s]  eating pieces of my brain matter.
[13330.31s -> 13332.31s]  And I'm just asleep.
[13332.31s -> 13335.13s]  And some of
[13335.13s -> 13339.10s]  them are still dancing with top hat.
[13339.10s -> 13343.90s]  I love earwigs.
[13343.90s -> 13346.65s]  How did you do that in like
[13346.65s -> 13352.46s]  a day? That was awesome.
[13352.46s -> 13354.46s]  Okay, Jerma owes the precious two point
[13354.46s -> 13356.63s]  oh god. I hate
[13356.63s -> 13358.63s]  this image. That's the image that pops up.
[13358.63s -> 13360.63s]  It's just so ugly.
[13380.63s -> 13384.64s]  And minus fifty.
[13422.86s -> 13424.86s]  Don't get up, don't get up.
[13424.86s -> 13426.86s]  Can't be the one with
[13426.86s -> 13428.86s]  the new earwigs.
[13428.86s -> 13430.86s]  Don't get up,
[13430.86s -> 13432.86s]  don't get up.
[13432.86s -> 13434.86s]  Why, why, why, why, why?

[13566.22s -> 13566.94s]  I don't listen.
[13566.94s -> 13569.02s]  I'm the only one that didn't say no.
[13569.02s -> 13570.10s]  I thought that was phenomenal.
[13570.10s -> 13571.14s]  I thought you did a great job.
[13571.14s -> 13571.94s]  I don't.
[13571.94s -> 13574.40s]  I don't listen to any of these jokers.
[13574.40s -> 13575.06s]  I thought that was great.
[13575.06s -> 13576.42s]  We've been working on it for like, what, two
[13576.42s -> 13577.82s]  weeks, three weeks now?
[13577.82s -> 13579.04s]  Well actually,
[13579.04s -> 13584.36s]  Sure. Well, my problem was it was a bit too fast. You see for Elise was wrote in for Elise
[13584.88s -> 13590.96s]  And it was actually really supposed to be a tender loving song that picked up at times like the heights of relationships
[13590.96s -> 13595.68s]  But also slowed down like the lows right and I didn't feel the passion come through although the notes did
[13596.28s -> 13598.28s]  Right. It's not good
[13599.56s -> 13601.48s]  He's got a point
[13601.48s -> 13603.20s]  number 14
[13603.20s -> 13608.53s]  That was a phenomenal phenomenal time of the piano, but after hearing what do you mean? It's not good judges
[13608.53s -> 13610.93s]  I only know what video game music is. What do you got?
[13611.57s -> 13613.57s]  Well, I mean, I just
[13614.81s -> 13621.37s]  Don't really listen to it. I thought that was quite lovely. It's perfect number 14. I'm so sorry
[13622.37s -> 13625.93s]  You got a great look. I think you look at the great. Look you got the look of the part
[13627.21s -> 13632.61s]  Apparently having a piano is an automatic no from like two people, but I don't want you to quit. Okay, what is it?
[13632.61s -> 13635.55s]  Who's this arcade? Joseph? Sorry. It can be a big thing
[13636.25s -> 13638.25s]  It can be a big

[14027.41s -> 14032.75s]  I think we have to do this one again. I think I think it has to be played again. It does

[18573.94s -> 18579.27s]  Uh, I want to say also real quick the vaude is probably absolutely destroyed
[18580.36s -> 18585.64s]  I would be surprised if you could even watch it. So in the event that it's absolutely just
[18586.34s -> 18592.68s]  Decimated I might have to just delete it. It depends. So be aware of that. It's a half. It's probably muted
[18593.40s -> 18595.40s]  Uh, if you weren't here, i'm really sorry, but
[18595.88s -> 18599.35s]  Uh dmca copyright, that's where we're
[18599.91s -> 18601.91s]  Okay, we just moved to vinny's channel
[18602.89s -> 18604.89s]  All right. Goodbye
