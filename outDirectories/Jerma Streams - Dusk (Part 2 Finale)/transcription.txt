[1.46s -> 22.57s]  Hi. Hello again, everybody. And TV here. Welcome back. We're gonna play Dusk. Picking up exactly
[22.57s -> 35.35s]  where we left off yesterday. This game is really good. Can we just please see Otto before you're
[35.35s -> 73.45s]  naked? Uh, you can't really see. Hold on. He blends in with the, he blends in with a blanket.
[74.49s -> 78.82s]  Let me see if I can brighten this up so you can zoom in on him and brighten it up.
[79.54s -> 119.74s]  I'm not sure it's possible, guys. Actually, maybe it is. Okay, hold on. Hey, Otto. Hello, Otto. Hello.
[120.30s -> 134.17s]  What are you doing? Yes, it's me. Otto. He's like, what are you doing? Who's my good dog?
[137.74s -> 151.38s]  There you go. Otto spotted. This is just what he does, guys. He just likes to hang out on a big
[151.38s -> 161.43s]  pillow and go to sleep. And he also likes going outside too. He's like a lizard. He just like,
[161.43s -> 172.30s]  he basks in the sun. That's what he does. He finds a spot in the house that has a strip of sunlight
[172.30s -> 177.90s]  coming through. And then he just gets in it and just lies on his back and just absorbs every ray.
[179.83s -> 192.20s]  He's the best. He works real hard. Yeah. Are you sure he's not a cat? Pretty sure. Let Otto play.
[193.08s -> 200.44s]  Hey, guys, Otto doesn't know what a video game is. I hate to break it to you.
[201.32s -> 210.71s]  But we're gonna leave just right where we left off. Dusk. Now, here's the thing about games.
[210.71s -> 219.50s]  I'm sure a lot of you guys know. There's this period of playing a game that's like this,
[220.06s -> 226.22s]  where you're up and up and up and up and up and it'd been stress, like good stress. Muscle memory.
[226.22s -> 232.38s]  You're into it. You're ready to fucking blow away everybody. And then you go to bed and you wake up
[232.38s -> 237.34s]  the next day and you play, you're like a wet noodle. So I'm gonna have to get back into it.
[237.90s -> 247.43s]  Here we go. Oh, you can't even see it. Oh, thank God. I thought my fucking whole stream's gonna
[247.43s -> 254.60s]  turn off. So I gotta, I gotta like move my arms around. I gotta get ready. I'm probably gonna die
[254.60s -> 258.92s]  like 10 times in the first five minutes. Maybe I'm not gonna die at all. What are you talking about?
[261.86s -> 266.26s]  But I love this game. This game's been more fun than anything that I've played in a long time.
[266.90s -> 285.18s]  Stamp it. I enjoy this. All right, let's go. Oh, where were we? Save, load here. I just started
[285.18s -> 292.92s]  level two. Oh, Otto wants to leave. He's like, now I want to leave. All right, let me let him out.
[292.92s -> 296.28s]  Hold on. I do. I thought he was gonna just lie down, but he's like, get me out of here. I don't
[296.28s -> 327.32s]  want to be in his room. So let me go let him out. Hold on. I'll be right back. Okay. He had his fun
[327.32s -> 341.53s]  lying down. Did he show Otto already? I did. All right, here we go. Load it. Press any key. All
[341.53s -> 350.65s]  right, let's get back into this here. Timing on that is good. Four, five, six, seven. One, two,
[350.65s -> 356.28s]  three, four, five, six, seven. Timing. All right, let's go. Oh, by the way, I was told I've been
[356.28s -> 364.26s]  doing this wrong the whole time. I was like flicking around and doing the the jump that way.
[364.26s -> 371.80s]  That's not how it works in this game. You just have to like jump diagonally like that.
[372.68s -> 377.40s]  I was going like doing the source engine jump and that's not what you're supposed to do.
[378.28s -> 391.05s]  And I was doing it all stream. Well, this is new. All right, let's take super shotgun out. Wait,
[391.05s -> 405.02s]  no, rifle. Yep, yep, yep, yep. Right in the head. See you later. Where are you?
[406.38s -> 411.70s]  All right. All right, blue chip is up there. Blue door in front of us. This is that little people
[411.70s -> 426.73s]  here. Yep. Yep. You're here for that fucking commentary. You're here for the yep commentary.
[427.37s -> 437.94s]  What's he at up top? Oh, yep. All right. I'm making I'm going to make some pretty good progress
[437.94s -> 454.68s]  today. I'll tell you. I thought I wasn't ready for this game. I used it. I didn't know they
[454.68s -> 462.82s]  could use it. They can. Where are they coming from? Where's where they come from? All right. I need
[462.82s -> 481.66s]  health. I don't slow down. Give me the blue chip. Save the game. Oh, fuck. No. Okay. How are we
[481.66s -> 489.40s]  doing? Good. I'm going to get over there. Good. Good. Good. Collect all the collectibles.
[490.76s -> 506.20s]  Save it. Oh, pod. What do I want to do here? Anything over this way? No. Can I jump from
[506.20s -> 520.66s]  here to there? Let's find out. No. Damn it. Damn it. Say pod one more time. I fucking dare you.
[522.42s -> 533.08s]  Jesus. I want to collect ammo because I want to make sure I have enough
[533.80s -> 543.22s]  as we continue here. I feel so good to play. It feels so good to play. Oh,
[554.02s -> 562.78s]  ain't fucking wrong with you. So I have the blue but all right this yellow over there.
[562.78s -> 575.58s]  I hear another yeller. Where's yeller? Secret door. Okay. I have to open this. All right.
[575.58s -> 581.48s]  There's a yeller in there. I don't know why I'm calling mama yeller. All right. Let's go open
[581.48s -> 595.19s]  the blue door. All right. Save it. I'm ready. What should I use? Let's go with mortars. Okay.
[596.47s -> 604.47s]  These are all going to open it. It's going to be a bunch of aliens because look at this.
[604.47s -> 619.05s]  There's a power up on top. Don't get fancy with it. So what am I supposed to do? Okay. Here we go.
[619.05s -> 625.37s]  Ready? That's probably the yellow key card I assume. How do I get up here? Can I jump up here?
[631.51s -> 655.43s]  Need to wall climb. Well here we go. Screaming doctor. Oh Jesus. Oh there's a bunch of screaming
[655.43s -> 679.40s]  doctors. I'm dead. Holy fuck. I don't even know where I am. All right. Settle down. Oh man. He's
[679.40s -> 687.30s]  made out of noodles. I am. I'm not. Okay. If I get touched once I'm dead. This guy's freaking me out.
[687.30s -> 690.98s]  Look at his pattern. His pattern's all fucked up. His pattern's all fucked up. And there's a guy
[690.98s -> 695.22s]  up there. All right. Don't do this. Just run in and shoot him. Oh my god.
[700.74s -> 709.85s]  All right. It's going to happen once. It's going to happen once. Get my mortars out. I'm ready.
[709.85s -> 718.78s]  I forgot about these guys. I almost had it too and that's unfortunate. I'm going to mortars.
[718.78s -> 723.56s]  It definitely went up. Oh a crossbow. Probably mortars. It's just been once. I'm going to get
[723.56s -> 744.47s]  him to run outside and go. Got it. All right. Now I can settle down a little and take out the
[745.43s -> 761.18s]  the rifle. Let's get the big guys upstairs. That's it, right? Damn it. All right. Not
[761.18s -> 776.14s]  pretty good. Not bad. Could have been better. Well, now I know you're up there. I could have
[776.14s -> 780.54s]  jumped through the window and grabbed that. No, that's super. That's super. I don't even know
[780.54s -> 788.20s]  what that is. That's like ultra move, right? Well, I have ultra move. Let's just get some health and
[788.20s -> 796.06s]  okay. Should I? I'm going to get ultra move and then I got to get the, uh, maybe that key.
[796.78s -> 801.86s]  Let me go down here. I'm going to save the super duper move.
[802.82s -> 814.62s]  Bastard. There's another guy down here. There's like a bunch of people down here. Isn't there?
[816.07s -> 832.55s]  Yeah. Oh my fucking God. I didn't know he was right there. All right. Come on.
[834.47s -> 845.38s]  Holy shit. She can go through there too. I don't know. She could aim that way. Stop cussing.
[849.18s -> 855.19s]  All right. Fine. I won't say any, I won't say any bad words for the next five minutes
[855.91s -> 861.26s]  or I'll eat. If I say, if I say a swear word in the next five minutes, I'll eat a ghost pepper.
[862.25s -> 883.42s]  What? That's good. What was that? Oh, it's, it's a when to go. Uh huh. All right. Give me this thing.
[885.21s -> 887.61s]  Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where, where is he? Where is he? Where am I?
[888.41s -> 901.00s]  Is there another one? I hear something. Okay. I can open that gate now. No, wait, wait, wait,
[901.00s -> 913.38s]  wait, wait, wait. I'm going to go save the game. Let me grab the, yeah. Turn this on. What's,
[913.38s -> 933.69s]  what's the matter? Ghost pepper swear challenge. Yeah. I'm good. Ghost pepper swear challenge.
[933.69s -> 938.41s]  All right. Let me keep going. Uh, what door opened? A door opened. It was this one.
[939.99s -> 944.07s]  All right. Here we go. I'm going to get the, give me the super power and I'm going to jump
[944.07s -> 948.95s]  through here. You ready? Let's see if I can do it in one swoop. Nope. I'm terrible. I almost set
[948.95s -> 952.07s]  a swear word. I would have to eat it. I would have had to eat a ghost pepper. Good thing I didn't.
[953.51s -> 967.99s]  Oh, I don't even like that one. That one's not that good. Geez.
[975.45s -> 991.00s]  Don't grab it yet. Even thinking about swearing. No, it doesn't. You guys even,
[991.00s -> 994.68s]  have you ever even seen somebody eat a ghost pepper? No, you haven't. What you've seen is
[994.68s -> 1000.92s]  you've seen YouTubers take a tomato that's under ripe and they eat it and pretend it's hot and they
[1000.92s -> 1028.41s]  go, Oh, they take sun dried tomatoes and then they pretend that they're hot. Here we go. Here we go.
[1028.41s -> 1033.61s]  Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. I'm doing it just so you have like a bunch of
[1033.61s -> 1040.49s]  clips of me saying it, even though you already, okay, hold on. Oh, here we go. Goodness.
[1046.50s -> 1063.75s]  Okay. Here we go. Did I just throw it over his head?
[1063.75s -> 1097.82s]  Gotta go to the yellow door. Good work. Oops. Hey, thanks. What, were you talking to me or were you
[1097.82s -> 1103.91s]  talking to chat? I hope you're talking to me. Get these onions. I hear somebody shooting. Who is it?
[1104.63s -> 1121.50s]  Wow. It's you out there, isn't it? I haven't gotten any secrets yet, which concerns me.
[1146.41s -> 1172.07s]  Okay. Here we go. Super hot. Super hot. Here we go.
[1173.75s -> 1195.06s]  How's he doing? Oh, there is one of those. I don't like the slow mode. It freaks me out.
[1195.94s -> 1212.17s]  All right. We're good. So now we're not good. Damn it. All right. It's okay. Okay. Here. I'm
[1212.17s -> 1218.07s]  not going to say it because I was going to say that the thing that I usually say, but I'm not
[1218.07s -> 1242.98s]  saying right now. All right. Here we go. Wait, save it. Give me these onions. I'm just so
[1242.98s -> 1248.50s]  concerned that it could be something around the corner. I'm ready. Yeah. I got a stuff saying,
[1248.50s -> 1275.93s]  here we go. Oh, it's going to be assault rifle and it's going to be fast. Let's do it.
[1306.34s -> 1323.40s]  Oh man. Wait, that's okay. I was panicking for no reason. I thought these were projectiles
[1323.40s -> 1335.99s]  coming to kill me. All right. I thought these were just bullets flying everywhere. That's why
[1335.99s -> 1353.46s]  I was freaking out. I don't want to touch that yet. I want to collect. There's a button to press
[1353.46s -> 1368.02s]  too. And this teleporter takes me somewhere. Hmm. A cage lowers. Oh, the other cage. Right.
[1371.14s -> 1376.63s]  All right. It's harder to not say here we go than it is to say the F word.
[1377.19s -> 1390.44s]  That was green. I thought it was a bad guy.
[1416.06s -> 1446.57s]  We clear. Don't get run over. Thank you. No secrets though. Damn it. How did I not get any
[1446.57s -> 1457.03s]  secrets? That's bad because there's a good, a lot of ammo and shit. It's been five minutes.
[1457.03s -> 1470.78s]  I'm going to use pistols because I just need it. I need to start using them. Yellow door right here.
[1471.34s -> 1485.43s]  This is horrible. I already don't like this level for obvious reasons. I need hunting
[1485.43s -> 1500.97s]  rifles. My favorite weapon. It's you down there, isn't it? Yep, it is. Make sure nothing else here.
[1503.02s -> 1513.96s]  Secret. I don't want to get zero out of five secrets. Is this Turok? This game is better
[1513.96s -> 1525.34s]  than Turok. Check over this way. Yep. This is what I'm saying. I gotta slow down. Okay.
[1531.38s -> 1552.14s]  Okay. Let's go. Save it. Is that a hunting rifle? Thank God. Psycho scientist. Jesus.
[1552.22s -> 1570.02s]  I hate those guys. They run so fast. All right. Red door.
[1575.50s -> 1584.95s]  Hunting rifle. My favorite weapon because I'm pinpoint accurate with it. Got two in one. I'm
[1584.95s -> 1601.59s]  going to get up here. Secret. There's two. See, I already am doing better than I was last time.
[1602.47s -> 1610.58s]  Put the hunting rifle away. Let's do pistols. I've been neglecting them so hard.
[1611.46s -> 1623.05s]  A lot of those guys around corners. What was that? I just heard a laugh. Oh, I thought that was a
[1623.05s -> 1647.82s]  wheezing laugh. What do I have ammo in? Only the pistols, seriously. What was that? I heard it.
[1647.82s -> 1662.82s]  Yep. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Point blank. Dead. Downstairs. Let's go.
[1663.54s -> 1674.74s]  Where is he? Didn't even take a hit. All right. I got yellow key. Nothing else, right?
[1675.46s -> 1695.91s]  Nothing else I need. No, let's go. The darkness spreads. The darkness is spreading. Blue door.
[1696.63s -> 1702.81s]  Saw a rifle. I'll use it. I'll use it. That sounds like a good idea right now.
[1707.70s -> 1718.81s]  What is that noise? I don't want to turn the corner. I don't want to turn the corner.
[1742.14s -> 1760.36s]  I need key. I almost just shot that. This is one of those adrenaline pumping games. I love it.
[1761.00s -> 1765.98s]  You open a door sometimes and it's just like you could just feel all your blood turn to a stone.
[1767.93s -> 1773.13s]  And nothing else in here. Go down, I guess. There was another way to go.
[1774.01s -> 1800.95s]  Down? Something down there. Okay, there's diamond down there. Just wait. I'm gonna go. I'm going
[1800.95s -> 1822.22s]  down. I thought that I could have. No. Going in. There comes somebody running. Oh, shit. I just
[1822.22s -> 1847.61s]  got triple tapped. Got him. Whoa. Wait, is there another sentry? There's another sentry somewhere.
[1848.49s -> 1861.22s]  If I move, I'm dead. Where is it? Where is it? Oh my goodness. Okay. All right. Shotgun time.
[1861.86s -> 1866.90s]  Let's replace that. I'm gonna use double shotgun. Yeah. I think that's time for it.
[1867.62s -> 1890.22s]  Why are they pushing each other? Who? It is blue. Let's get that blue key. What was it over here?
[1891.18s -> 1905.35s]  Right there. Can I get up to this one? Oh. Nice try. Almost. Almost killed me. It was close.
[1905.83s -> 1920.90s]  There's a lot of stuff here though. I don't want to just run away. Wait a minute. Let me check. No,
[1920.90s -> 1927.42s]  let's just go. Somebody else will get the secrets. One of you guys will get the secrets.
[1936.10s -> 1966.15s]  Run. I can hear him running. He's got like, hooves. That's the way. Wait, what's over here?
[1966.71s -> 1978.90s]  Nothing. That's a lot of mortars. That's a lot. Uh, maybe a rib. I got, I got a lot of,
[1978.90s -> 1990.68s]  I don't want to use these yet though. This is a boss killer. Let's use mortars. Did I
[1990.68s -> 2000.26s]  tele-frag somebody? What happened? Where is he? I can hear him. I can hear his hooves.
[2000.98s -> 2012.71s]  I can hear his hooves. Where is he? I hear multiple hooves. Oh, where is he?
[2020.46s -> 2054.60s]  Ow. My whole body. Okay. I'm fine. Oh, he's still alive. Oh, okay. Can I peek out now?
[2060.18s -> 2085.70s]  Good. That's why they gave all those to me. How kind of them. Go up. Oh, why is the gas in here
[2085.70s -> 2096.54s]  now? All right. Blue door, blue door. And then I got to let Otto back in the room.
[2098.84s -> 2112.71s]  He's like, I want to get out of here. And then he's like, let me back in. The blue door is down
[2112.71s -> 2122.07s]  here, I think. All right. Was it? No, it wasn't. Where was it? All right. Hold on. Let me go get
[2122.07s -> 2166.84s]  him. Hold on a second. Okay. Now he's happy. I'm watching like 15 minutes. He's like, hey,
[2167.56s -> 2182.09s]  this room sucks. I want to go somewhere else. We'll see. You good? He's good. He's just a cat.
[2184.70s -> 2203.26s]  All right. Blue door. Secret. Oh, this is good for me. That's very good for me. There he goes.
[2203.42s -> 2213.45s]  Down. Just sitting down. Good boy. All right. Let's uh, that's a red door. What was the blue one?
[2214.01s -> 2221.91s]  I remember I always look at them and I go, there's blue door. And then I forget where they were.
[2222.63s -> 2234.31s]  Where is it? Use your map. There ain't no map in this game. Wait, is it this way? Was it over here?
[2251.58s -> 2270.12s]  Did I go back too far? I think I went back too far. Press M. There's no map in this game, guys.
[2270.84s -> 2281.51s]  It was next to the red text. What is that? I always just say, there it is. There's the blue door.
[2281.51s -> 2296.92s]  And then I, it's gone immediately. I forget where it is entirely because the game made me come back
[2296.92s -> 2303.98s]  up here. So it has to be up here. And that has to be back up this way, right? It has to be.
[2304.62s -> 2332.50s]  It was just around this little corner. Here we go. Red door is back down there. Remember that.
[2332.98s -> 2367.16s]  Clip it for me. Oh, you dare? Holy shit. I just got destroyed. I'm going to get up on these roofs.
[2368.33s -> 2383.77s]  I think I'm going to try to at least. Can I? I have to press. I have to touch this. Oh no. 5G.
[2387.98s -> 2396.42s]  This is the source of the 5G. We're going to follow this all the way down. It's going to be,
[2396.42s -> 2403.69s]  it's going to be an alien down here. Sparks take from men, bad, which has never been taken.
[2403.69s -> 2410.02s]  I always knew that 5G was fucking just Satan. The whole thing, the whole wireless technology
[2410.02s -> 2413.62s]  makes no sense. Like you could send that shit through wirelessly with no wires.
[2416.31s -> 2421.85s]  The whole thing's fucked up. I just quick saved it right here. That was probably a huge mistake.
[2433.02s -> 2451.58s]  All right. I need to use the daredevil technique. Can't open this door.
[2453.08s -> 2470.01s]  All these doors don't open. There's a switch back here. What's it for though? What was that?
[2470.01s -> 2495.08s]  Oh, shadow. Oh, that's how you light up a place. That's a gasoline tank. Wait, the red
[2496.15s -> 2501.93s]  was in a secret. The key card for the red door back there is a secret. That's sort of
[2502.57s -> 2542.33s]  hard. Oh, we got the lights back on. This is fine. I heard it. Oh my God. I just fell down.
[2543.05s -> 2557.22s]  Where am I going? The root. What does it say? What does it say? There's too much smoke. The ruins
[2558.10s -> 2578.18s]  held knowledge. We sold our souls for it. All cars built of concrete. Fed with blood.
[2578.18s -> 2610.41s]  I missed the flashlight. What? Where? Where's the flashlight? Are you serious? I'm going to run.
[2610.41s -> 2632.46s]  I can't see anything. Navigate with your bullet holes. There it is.
[2634.10s -> 2644.07s]  Ha ha ha. Okay, just give me a sec. This is the way back. I don't even use the pistols anyways.
[2644.87s -> 2657.53s]  Wait, what's down there? Oh, that's where I need to go. Navigate with bullet holes. There we go.
[2659.98s -> 2669.48s]  The ruins held knowledge. We sold our souls for it. Couldn't read that one. All cars built of
[2669.48s -> 2692.55s]  concrete. Fed with blood and bone. This door opens elsewhere. Nice secret. I'll take it.
[2699.86s -> 2702.66s]  Get everything first. Something bad is going to happen when I press this button
[2705.77s -> 2735.58s]  and then grind it up. I think I just power the facility with meat. But wait,
[2735.58s -> 2750.47s]  I don't want to end the level yet. No, I thought it didn't say end level. It just said open door.
[2750.47s -> 2759.99s]  Usually it says end level. It said exit, but it doesn't say end level. It says end level.
[2761.34s -> 2769.66s]  I've been trolled a couple times with exits before. No, I'm going back. I'm going back.
[2769.66s -> 2798.44s]  It's this one, right? Did I get that shit? Yeah. All right. I'm not going this way. I'm going back.
[2799.64s -> 2813.46s]  Here we are. Red door. Now, fellas, ladies and fellas, where was that red door? I don't remember.
[2813.46s -> 2836.63s]  Over here, right? Was it this way? Red door. Here we go. That's what I'm talking about. That's
[2836.63s -> 2845.24s]  quite, that's a secret. Now I have to get back to where I was. So the real question is,
[2846.12s -> 2870.14s]  um, huh? How do you want me to do that? Just have to run there. But there's power here now.
[2870.78s -> 2890.62s]  Am I going to lose the health that I just got? Nope. Good. Now I can leave. Where the hell was
[2890.62s -> 2898.89s]  it again? I can open this. I can open these those too. Remember these wouldn't open before?
[2900.79s -> 2905.67s]  Wait a minute. There's like another door or two that were closed. This was, okay, this one was
[2905.67s -> 2930.94s]  closed. This one was closed too, right? Ah, don't read the tweet. Already did. Now I can leave.
[2930.94s -> 2951.30s]  I just 100% level. I did. That's the first time I've done that. But you cheated. It's all right.
[2951.30s -> 2964.30s]  You can go back and re-cheat. Here it comes. No turning back now. All right, there's health back
[2964.30s -> 2989.29s]  here. These two of them. Bad. That was, that's why there's all the health back here. I see. Mortars.
[3002.34s -> 3022.34s]  Exterminated. Crossbow. Why is this here? I'm not going there yet. Let's go this way.
[3022.42s -> 3071.37s]  Kill him. Whoa! You were standing there. Big whoa. Big whoa. Anything down here? Red door. Okay.
[3071.37s -> 3079.69s]  I want to take a mental picture of this place. Stairwell. Goes down with the, great with the
[3079.69s -> 3088.63s]  lava. Around the corner. Great with lava. Downstairs. Red door. I got it. Memorized. Downstairs.
[3088.63s -> 3100.18s]  Red door. Lava. Great. Got it. Okay. Yellow door. Yellow door is in the same room as red door.
[3100.18s -> 3105.22s]  They're in the same room upstairs instead of down. Up the stairs. They're in the same area. Got it.
[3105.78s -> 3125.18s]  Okay. Green pyramid. Red door. No, don't say that. You're gonna mess it up. I know what it is. It's
[3125.18s -> 3151.75s]  red lava. Great. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. That spikes. If I slide under there, I'm dead.
[3154.31s -> 3185.50s]  That's a mama. Whoa! Nice aim. Let's check the rest of this place out. What we got?
[3186.30s -> 3198.87s]  I have a lot of the riveter ammo. I should probably use it.
[3199.99s -> 3227.43s]  So now it's boss only. Bosses only. Red key. I know what that room is. That's a new enemy.
[3227.43s -> 3238.52s]  No it's not. I've seen that enemy a million times. Gotta make these count. I can't just miss.
[3239.32s -> 3290.07s]  I want to get up there. Blue key up there. Whatever. Just let me out. Red. This is a room
[3290.07s -> 3294.23s]  that's gonna be full with people. They're all down. They're all down. They're all down.
[3302.58s -> 3324.09s]  Give me... No! Stop it! I want this. Can that go through the grate? Yep. All right. Anything
[3324.09s -> 3334.89s]  else up here? Secrets. Money. Blue door. That's... This is where the blue door is. I would forget this.
[3336.14s -> 3344.87s]  Green sewer room. This blue door. He only cares about money.
[3366.94s -> 3380.71s]  Killing spree. Pretty good progress. What's the point of being down here though? Can I open this?
[3393.80s -> 3420.82s]  Oh my... No! No! No! Fuck! Speaking gibberish. That's all... Just gibberish. Whatever. Boss only.
[3420.82s -> 3440.04s]  Am I bumping into the wall? Oh there was a wall here. They've turned us mad. Teleporter.
[3440.68s -> 3458.15s]  Let's move. Kill him. I'm up now. Here it comes. Yellow.
[3462.33s -> 3464.01s]  Yellow key. I know what that door is.
[3466.17s -> 3483.64s]  I only have 30 health. That's not good. This is very bad actually.
[3484.04s -> 3528.34s]  Missed a secret wall? What? Where? That's not it? What is it? I got it. Put the motors away. Double
[3528.34s -> 3555.46s]  shotgun. Did you actually... Did one of these little idiots just got me? I'm gonna turn this
[3555.46s -> 3572.81s]  corner and I'm gonna hear that. No. I'm almost dead though. All right. That was... I need health.
[3572.81s -> 3583.67s]  I need health. I need health. I need health. Damn. I thought there was like... I thought there was gonna
[3583.67s -> 3604.22s]  be something over here. Give me a saw rifle for this part.
[3609.43s -> 3620.70s]  I can slide under these. Can I not slide under these? I guess not. Nothing under them anyways.
[3627.48s -> 3642.60s]  Damn. Took a while. All right. I'm going... That's a terrible place to fight this. I gotta jump around.
[3642.60s -> 3655.11s]  All right. Double battle shotgun. I'm gonna jump over him. Kill him. So let's drag him back here.
[3655.91s -> 3671.66s]  That's a tight place to fight this thing. Maybe if I run by him. I'll try running by him.
[3673.02s -> 3704.31s]  No. Just gotta be right in his face the whole time. All right. There's the key. Is that the key?
[3705.83s -> 3734.76s]  No. Well, shit. Can I break this? 15 health. Hmm. Well. Am I missing something here?
[3735.40s -> 3750.95s]  There was no switch I could have licked around. Is this a collapsible door? Wait. What about
[3751.03s -> 3756.04s]  switches over here? There we are. All right. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. We're good.
[3766.86s -> 3787.78s]  Any repeaters? What do you mean repeaters? Any repeaters? What? I don't like that sound.
[3792.73s -> 3829.10s]  This is why I saved it. This is why I saved it. I swear to God, Jeremy. That's why I saved this.
[3829.66s -> 3843.46s]  We're gonna. Okay. I'm gonna keep it out because I keep hearing this shit and I'm gonna press the
[3843.46s -> 3859.61s]  button and I'm gonna get attacked again. What the fuck is this? Why did I use the. I saved it there
[3859.61s -> 3869.40s]  too. Why did I use it on the alligator? Oh no. I used it all on the alligator. That wasn't even
[3869.40s -> 3873.80s]  the real boss fight. That was the pretend boss fight for the real boss fight, which is this.
[3874.76s -> 3904.62s]  Did you just bounce that back? All right. That actually wasn't that bad.
[3905.93s -> 3918.42s]  Uh, is there. Do I have to do that? It's something else happening now. Is that the boss fight before
[3918.42s -> 3931.69s]  the boss fight before the real boss fight? I don't know, but make sure I have everything.
[3933.59s -> 3947.30s]  Okay. I guess we're just going. What about the blue door? What about the blue key? Oh,
[3947.30s -> 3958.17s]  it was the real boss fight with the rats. Yeah, it kind of was. What about this? What about
[3958.17s -> 3969.11s]  that? How do I do that? Oh no. I didn't get it. It's okay. It's all right. One of the walls was
[3969.11s -> 3986.04s]  faked. Ah, shit. Pretty bad secret finding on that run, but it's all right. This one's called the
[3986.04s -> 3995.13s]  gauntlet. Hooray. I feel like this is going to be fun. This is going to be a very fun part of the
[3995.13s -> 4025.38s]  game. I want to get these onions. Bring it on. I can't jump up there. I absolutely can. What is
[4025.38s -> 4032.04s]  all this? Wait, where did I just go? I don't even know where I just went. I went through like a
[4032.04s -> 4040.79s]  teleporter. I thought, I thought it was going to be this. I thought, okay, I don't know what in my
[4040.79s -> 4047.03s]  stupid ass brain. I thought that teleporter was going to go to here. I thought it was going to be
[4047.03s -> 4053.45s]  a shitty engineer teleporter that they just build out of, out of just muscle memory. You know, you,
[4053.45s -> 4057.05s]  this is, you exit the spawn door. Here's the teleporter and then you go and there's the exit
[4057.05s -> 4059.93s]  just because they put it down because they were just OCD putting stuff down.
[4061.42s -> 4065.74s]  I don't know why I thought that that was just try. Okay. I'm ready. I still want to get this
[4065.74s -> 4085.64s]  stuff though. Is there like a fake wall? Cause I can't reach this. Do a rocket jump. That's
[4085.64s -> 4090.12s]  going to hurt me too much. No, I'm fine. I got 150 health. Let's go. Let's fight them.
[4090.84s -> 4099.75s]  So here we go. Let's do mortar first. Fuck. I'm in trouble. Slide jump. Does that work?
[4107.29s -> 4111.37s]  Rocket jump. Yeah, I'm going to hurt myself to rocket jump up here to get the same amount of
[4111.37s -> 4125.61s]  health that I'm probably going to lose by rocket jumping. Do a crossbow jump. You can,
[4125.61s -> 4141.59s]  you can crossbow jump. What? I hold on. Am I about to kill the boss with this magic soap?
[4150.50s -> 4166.34s]  Wait, where'd the soap go? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4166.34s -> 4168.66s]  Is the soap in there? What'd I do with this?
[4186.94s -> 4198.42s]  That's not, I feel like that's kind of, uh, let me, um, I don't, that's not fair though.
[4198.42s -> 4208.94s]  That's not fair. Like I just beat that, that I beat him. I magic soaked him. I mean, look,
[4208.94s -> 4216.44s]  you told me how to jump up there, but I saw the door. I mean, it's, it's intentional.
[4220.73s -> 4234.10s]  All right. Well, that's fun. Let's go three more to go. I can just walk around and just look at
[4234.10s -> 4255.66s]  this. Oh, I'm in danger. There's too many things here. It's the last one. Am I a cheater? No,
[4255.66s -> 4269.35s]  I didn't put input any commands. How do I open this? Maybe I should just leave. There's only
[4269.35s -> 4317.74s]  two here. Just take the other teleporter. Where's the last switch? I don't understand. Go to the
[4317.74s -> 4324.10s]  other one. I already did. Wait a minute. Hold on. I was, I must've been turned around like three
[4324.10s -> 4334.65s]  times then. Cause I, I've tried to go to the other teleporter. Wait, is this the, is it the,
[4334.65s -> 4342.42s]  no magic. Where's my magic soap? I hear rock music. Where's my magic soap? I put it in here,
[4342.42s -> 4368.84s]  didn't I? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. One more to go. Don't get that yet. Sequence complete. Where is he?
[4368.84s -> 4395.37s]  Where's the boss? Is he, is he dead? Oh, he's just dead. What's the, I got an achievement called low
[4395.37s -> 4422.33s]  tech. It's cause I didn't fire a gun. It's cause I soaked him. I just beat it. I beat that episode.
[4422.97s -> 4428.34s]  That was the final boss of the episode and I instantly killed him. As you step into the
[4428.34s -> 4433.94s]  unholy portal powered by ungodly means there's no doubt what you must do. Hubris and fanaticism have
[4433.94s -> 4438.74s]  woken something powerful, horrible beyond anything you can imagine. You must uncover the truth. Who
[4438.74s -> 4462.01s]  knows what nightmare awaits you in the nameless city. Cool. Episode three. Let's do it. In the
[4462.01s -> 4476.84s]  nameless city. Out next week? No, out right now. This difficulty is not intended for a first
[4476.84s -> 4483.48s]  playthrough. Although you are German 985 and this is your first playthrough, but you have enough
[4483.48s -> 4495.14s]  skill to be able to press this button. That's what it said. Mint? Low doubt. What is going on?
[4497.22s -> 4502.10s]  Why can I, why am I, I can cheat? Why can I cheat? Is this cheating? What's going on?
[4503.22s -> 4527.88s]  So I, is this, is this supposed to be like, you go like the God level? No campaign to, oh.
[4529.18s -> 4536.81s]  Oops. New episode. All right. I see. Okay.
[4541.19s -> 4574.12s]  Episode three. The nameless city. The iron cathedral. Welcome to hell. Sickles.
[4574.12s -> 4579.96s]  You don't get to keep anything. Let's move. Get my flashlight though. And I get the sword. Is
[4579.96s -> 4586.44s]  this going to, wait, is this a sword only level or something? The sword is a silent takedown at
[4586.44s -> 4600.07s]  a hundred or more health. Hold attack to charge strike. What? What? Charge strike? Silent takedown.
[4600.07s -> 4608.92s]  Why does that matter? Gotta hide a gas can back here on me. I'll be sure to use it the second
[4608.92s -> 4633.96s]  the door opens. And two onions. Let's go. Do I have to sneak? All of a sudden it's a stealth game.
[4634.68s -> 4654.20s]  Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean stupid? What's going on? What? Gas can on the wall.
[4654.76s -> 4675.00s]  What wall? What? What are you talking about? At the spawn. I love how I'm stupid for this.
[4681.26s -> 4713.11s]  It's stupid. How idiotic of him to not go back to the wall at spawn. It's kind of fun
[4713.85s -> 4734.41s]  playing a game. We get out of here. You didn't even do that. What the fuck was that thing? It's
[4734.41s -> 4741.02s]  a night. It's a, it's a, it's a night. Oh my God. Do I have to fight it with the sword?
[4741.58s -> 4769.96s]  Do you, is there a parry? It's a parry. That's a parry. I can't charge it. I have to be at a hundred
[4769.96s -> 4780.76s]  health. Wait, this is the, hold on. I'm not going this far yet. There was a weapon over here that
[4780.76s -> 4786.44s]  I could get. No, not yet. How do I get over there? I probably have to go down at some point. All
[4786.44s -> 4792.94s]  right. That is the right one. Is the only way to go. Kill about dipshit stupid dipshit idiot.
[4792.94s -> 4805.99s]  Fucking idiot. Stupid. What a dipshit idiot. Fucking idiot. At 50 or more morale, hold aim
[4805.99s -> 4816.28s]  with the sword to block attacks. Yeah. And you got a soap right here. You know, I'm pretty good at
[4816.28s -> 4828.66s]  finding the soap. I will say I'm really good at finding the secret soaps and using them is another
[4828.66s -> 4839.06s]  thing. Where'd it go? I'm good at finding the soap. I'm not going to be using the soap.
[4860.79s -> 4875.51s]  Wow. All right. I'm not going to be using soap. All right. Now let's go.
[4876.87s -> 4898.41s]  I don't have a hundred health though. Stupid. Where's the soap? That's why your name is Jerma.
[4901.30s -> 4911.69s]  I mean, that's pretty funny. It is. Wait for the guy with the night. I need the night.
[4912.57s -> 4946.62s]  This fun. This is fun. Wow. I love it. And I soaked. No, don't. Why am I even doing that?
[4961.06s -> 4977.34s]  Hey, what? Where did you come from? 112 health. Where's the soap? I'm just gonna bring it with me
[4977.34s -> 4983.85s]  everywhere. It's always good to get rid of one of the hard enemies with it. Although is this
[4983.85s -> 4997.00s]  unlimited use? Can I use this as many times as I want? I'm trying to attack. Not going to work
[4997.00s -> 5020.92s]  like that, man. Sorry. He got annoyed at this. Check. I still don't understand what the smelly
[5020.92s -> 5075.45s]  crystal does. What does the smelly crystal do? That didn't block it. All right. I got the blue
[5075.45s -> 5096.22s]  key, but there's a lot of ways to, there's a bunch of random vents in this level. I guess over this
[5096.22s -> 5103.13s]  way, but there was another way to go. I think I could down. There's a crystal over there,
[5103.21s -> 5113.30s]  but wait a minute. I can open this door. I think that's progression. Hold on. My power went out.
[5113.30s -> 5118.50s]  What happened? Mine did too. What? I just turned the stream back on. What? Do you live in Vegas?
[5119.64s -> 5146.41s]  We're all mad here. No, this is okay. So I do have a blue key though. Wasn't there a blue door all the
[5146.41s -> 5172.20s]  way back? I already have to pee. What a disaster. Because that could go down. Oh, I gotta pee. This
[5172.20s -> 5182.20s]  is messing with my brain to be able to play the video game correctly. Yeah, I gotta go.
[5182.20s -> 5188.50s]  I'll be right back. It's messing with my ability to play the video game. This is what happens when
[5188.50s -> 5197.64s]  you just drink large coffees every morning. Be right back. Don't go anywhere. Or if you have to
[5197.64s -> 5327.93s]  go, fine. But if not, then stay. All right, we're good. I just dropped my lip balm on the ground.
[5327.93s -> 5330.65s]  It's capped and everything, but it just hit the ground. I have to get another one.
[5331.61s -> 5344.81s]  There's germs on the ground. How big is the large coffee? How many ounces? You don't even want to
[5344.81s -> 5350.76s]  know. If I told you guys the amount of ounces that I had in my coffee, you'd think I was a
[5350.76s -> 5365.51s]  fucking sicko. I only do this like once every few weeks. But every time I do it, I always feel
[5365.51s -> 5377.94s]  bad about it. That's a secret door if I've ever seen one. Nice. Good thing I went back here.
[5378.58s -> 5391.66s]  Now I got a mortar. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's 32 ounces. Yep. I know. And even worse,
[5392.63s -> 5401.21s]  way worse than it being 32 ounces. Light ice. You're a fucking psycho. Hey, can I get that with
[5401.21s -> 5408.46s]  light ice, please? Oh, okay. So you're, you're, you're a mutant. Okay. Got that. Now I need the
[5408.46s -> 5416.49s]  blue door. Where was the blue door? There was a red door here. Anyone remember the blue door?
[5416.49s -> 5423.69s]  Anybody remember a blue door? I didn't burn it into my memory because I don't think it exists.
[5424.49s -> 5435.67s]  Blue door? Was there something else I could do back here? Blue door. I remember. And I got the
[5435.67s -> 5442.54s]  soap here too. You know, I didn't burn it into my brain because of that. This one, a blue door is
[5442.54s -> 5452.90s]  blue things next to the door. Nice block. I can't get more than one. Okay. I, for some reason,
[5452.90s -> 5477.26s]  I thought I could get two with a swipe. Is that open? That's okay. And then there's a beep too.
[5477.26s -> 5483.69s]  There was somebody that guy fucking, that was a multiple jump scare in front of me, guy running
[5483.69s -> 5491.54s]  at me and to my left, a fucking horn at the same exact time. I don't know if you guys heard the
[5491.54s -> 5509.93s]  horn. It was a huge beep. Somebody probably heard it. Someone with good ears. The soap is so good.
[5517.96s -> 5531.93s]  Oh my God. I just got embarrassed. That was embarrassed. Just straight up. I mean, just
[5531.93s -> 5538.71s]  embarrassed. So, so let me get this straight. You got, it's gotta actually physically hit the weapon,
[5538.71s -> 5552.98s]  right? It's not just, hey, your, your screen is now safe. I blame the double jump scare.
[5558.73s -> 5562.01s]  All right, we're good. Now let's go back here and get the diamond. I don't even need it.
[5562.57s -> 5570.34s]  Let's throw some mortars down the halls, huh? Soap is taking too much time. I'm going soapless.
[5573.62s -> 5593.91s]  Okay. So it's just, it's a, it's a mystery good to go around here.
[5594.87s -> 5611.59s]  You got to find the right way. It's a maze. It's a mystery. There it is. I don't think that's it.
[5616.20s -> 5636.41s]  Remember the crossbow? I just jumped over that sword. Just want to make sure we're all aware
[5636.41s -> 5654.38s]  of that one. All right, that's it. I got the, the new crossbow bullets. I didn't get anything else.
[5657.91s -> 5671.91s]  There are wells to go. I guess the lava arrow pointing down. Sure. Does the book do anything?
[5672.55s -> 5685.66s]  I feel like the book doesn't do just whatever. Throw me. Could have got those all with one hit.
[5686.46s -> 5702.42s]  Not efficient. Look at this inefficiency. It's angering me. There we go. And I, you know,
[5702.42s -> 5714.71s]  I missed the crossbow goes through walls. That's right. It does. I forget.
[5719.48s -> 5750.82s]  Yep. That's pretty useful. Efficiency. Better. Not efficient. I feel like I could probably be
[5750.82s -> 5779.91s]  efficient in this room though. What the fuck is this? Why is there a dog in a box? Bad dog.
[5783.83s -> 5800.66s]  Bad dog. No, not you. Not you. I know you're in the same room, but not you. I don't want
[5800.66s -> 5814.94s]  them to hear that. You're a good dog. You're a good dog. Yes. All enemies dead. Fire and ice.
[5815.74s -> 5823.22s]  This is a new item. Lava cannot harm you. Oh, that's in limited time.
[5846.50s -> 5869.05s]  Do I have two swords? Oh, that's too bad. All right. Now what? Where is he? There. I need
[5869.05s -> 5878.12s]  another one of those, the lava head. Unless maybe can I go up? I'm going to try going this way.
[5878.84s -> 5891.53s]  I guess I can go this way. Did I miss anything over here? Oh, you son of a bitch. I, how did I,
[5891.53s -> 5897.70s]  why you? Yeah. 28 health. Just, I got to shoot this thing. There's a secret wall here. Hopefully
[5897.70s -> 5918.97s]  there's health here. Dick. All right. There is health in here. Good. Lots of, uh, really?
[5920.86s -> 5943.50s]  Really? Now what's that going to do for me? Hold on. Can I get up there? Holy shit.
[5945.16s -> 5965.58s]  Well, um, that's cool. I made, I skipped this blue door. Just don't fall. There's something
[5965.58s -> 5990.25s]  over there. I have to make this jump. I have to get this load. Why did, did I, hold on,
[5990.25s -> 6003.64s]  did I just save it right there? No, I didn't. Okay. So now save it here so I can get back across,
[6007.77s -> 6018.86s]  get back across. We're just gonna, we're going to save scum again. Not that it's not that bad.
[6019.67s -> 6022.95s]  All right. Now I'm going to open this door. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing right now,
[6022.95s -> 6033.32s]  but apparently I'm doing this. Oh, fuck. Why did I just do that? Don't, why would I jump away?
[6033.88s -> 6041.24s]  That's like, I just did like a fight or flight. It was flight. Flight. As much as you could
[6041.24s -> 6059.18s]  describe what that word is. Flight. What? Oh, I can't, I can't right click. I can't,
[6059.18s -> 6073.05s]  I don't have any morale. Fuck. Zero morale. Right. Okay. I need to have at least 50, right?
[6073.05s -> 6083.66s]  Damn. That's not good. I feel like I'm going to need that, uh, gas can.
[6084.30s -> 6094.78s]  And there's a soap down here. What the hell did I do? What, how, what direction is that even going?
[6095.58s -> 6115.53s]  I, I need the blue key. Am I, I'm behind the door that the blue key opens. Right? I think so.
[6116.25s -> 6128.18s]  I think I just have to go back. Yeah, I just have to go back down. Um, whatever. Okay. I guess I
[6128.18s -> 6137.29s]  know that's there. No, I'm not soft-locked. I'm good. Has to actually go this way, which is the
[6137.29s -> 6165.13s]  correct way. Okay. I thought that wasn't, that was not an enemy. I thought it was. God doing like
[6165.13s -> 6185.75s]  the extreme NPC walk. Pistol. There's nothing even here to shoot. I got the super power up, but it
[6185.75s -> 6193.27s]  didn't. Okay. There's red and blue door over there. I need a key, man. No one opens elsewhere. All
[6193.27s -> 6222.39s]  right. Um, I guess I'm just going down. I ain't going down there yet. Now I am. Finally some
[6222.39s -> 6238.95s]  morale. It's been forever. And a shotgun. Finally. Shotgun shells. Ooh, I could go, let me jump.
[6238.95s -> 6245.64s]  Hold on. Don't go there yet. What's over here? Nothing. I've already been over here.
[6251.45s -> 6266.15s]  Lots of shotgun shells. It's armor. What do you mean it's armor? What's armor? Secret? What do I
[6266.15s -> 6271.80s]  do with this? Uh, don't go in the, is that going to light up? Is that going to, it doesn't explode,
[6271.80s -> 6277.42s]  right? No. Should I bring it with me? He's going to bring it with me. No, I'm just going to throw
[6277.42s -> 6289.34s]  it in there. Just whip it in there. I don't know if that did anything. Here comes a fight.
[6293.19s -> 6310.49s]  Yeah. Yup. Yup. I can climb any wall. Hold on. I need to make, I'm not going to do this yet. I
[6310.49s -> 6328.98s]  want to get stuff. Oh, fuck. Whatever. Just finally. Okay. Um, just make sure I don't miss
[6328.98s -> 6340.66s]  anything. Smelly crystal. I don't know what these do. Okay. I should probably, I probably need to
[6340.66s -> 6354.09s]  get up there. Is that soap? Hello? What did I just, what the hell just happened?
[6355.37s -> 6394.31s]  That's a backflip. Nothing else I can do. This is gold. Good. Good. Do a flip. I told you I could
[6394.31s -> 6402.10s]  do a backflip. Have I ever proven that? No, no, I actually can't do it anymore. Absolutely cannot
[6402.10s -> 6420.14s]  do it anymore. Too old to do it? Yeah. I, yes, I'm too old to do that. Without a doubt. I'm certain
[6420.14s -> 6430.66s]  that I'm too old. All right. Now I can use my sword if I need it. We're going to go back down.
[6430.66s -> 6457.03s]  We're going to. I'm not fucking around with that. No loot? How dare you? I could go up a little
[6457.03s -> 6484.20s]  higher I think. Yeah, I can. Ah. The crossbow is a lot of fun. Oh, drunk fighting. I was too,
[6484.20s -> 6490.97s]  I was too drunk to hit me. I don't know how that works. That makes no sense what I just said.
[6499.74s -> 6518.30s]  Blue key. What door over there? Oh, that's the door. That's the, that's the blue door.
[6518.86s -> 6549.54s]  Okay. Right. Now I can just go this way. Got him. That guy fell to his death. I didn't have to do
[6549.54s -> 6563.78s]  anything. Come on. Kill me. I'm here. Kill me. Boss fight incoming. Uh huh. Three more of these to
[6563.78s -> 6568.50s]  touch. I'm going to get. All right. Let's see. What about, what about mortars? Or sword maybe.
[6574.68s -> 6600.38s]  Rifle. Best weapon. The waves of destruction. To know. Any more writing? Two more to go. One
[6600.38s -> 6609.02s]  more to go. This is a rifle. This is going to be a sniping level. That's much as certain.
[6614.02s -> 6648.44s]  I think it's probably inside. The damning cooling gun. Cooling sun. Where is it?
[6649.40s -> 6652.76s]  Did I miss one? I must've missed one.
[6656.78s -> 6669.27s]  Here it is. Oh, they're flying.
[6680.31s -> 6721.86s]  Shit. It's hard to see my crosshair because it's snowy. It's very snowy. Yeah.
[6721.86s -> 6735.48s]  Jerma gave his older brother the controller. Yeah. Junko. Jerma's older brother. Junko.
[6740.18s -> 6745.70s]  Junko. All right. Got red key. I can go back down. Uh wait. Did I miss anything?
[6747.90s -> 6763.64s]  It's just fun to shoot in this game. It's very fun. Just is. All right. Let's go. There's a red
[6763.64s -> 6774.41s]  door down here. Somewhere. I don't know. Whatever. Wherever it is. It's back this way. I think it's
[6774.41s -> 6785.50s]  back here. Right? No. Where is it? No. Where was it? No. It was back here. Don't worry. Just
[6785.50s -> 6793.00s]  leap. Oh my. Oh my fucking god. That scared the shit out of me. I was about to say have no
[6793.00s -> 6810.84s]  fear. Junko will save the day. That's a one hit kill. Good to know. Where the? Holy shit. It's
[6810.84s -> 6828.18s]  an ant. It's one of those monsters. Just stand still. It's gonna hit. Should I do it? Yeah.
[6828.90s -> 6849.62s]  True hard run would have no saves. Sure. I guess. But the true hard mode is also take one hit of
[6849.62s -> 6856.90s]  damage and you die. Actually that's not even actually what that mode is for. This is the
[6856.90s -> 6863.98s]  hardest game mode in the game that I'm on right now. The one above it is a challenge mode. It's a
[6863.98s -> 6874.31s]  challenge mode. Specifically challenge mode. So it is true. This is the hardest difficulty of the
[6874.31s -> 6891.00s]  regular game. There's a lot of people dead over here. Well this is gonna be fun. Actually it's
[6891.00s -> 6903.22s]  gonna be fun. I like the ones where you can just like ski around. All these. Can I open these?
[6903.22s -> 6914.17s]  This door opens elsewhere. This door. Well I know you exist now. That's good. Who's talking?
[6914.81s -> 6933.29s]  What are they? I'm not gonna use those bullets. Might as well use them for that. Hold on. Give
[6933.29s -> 6946.07s]  me this stuff. Go down the well. There's all kinds of little things to look at. This one opens.
[6948.86s -> 6970.31s]  Where is he? Up top. Yep. What the? Flying fuck.
[6971.11s -> 7007.46s]  Fuck. Quit edge guarding me. Was this Smash Brothers? Not fair. You can open these doors
[7007.46s -> 7021.53s]  from the other side. All right. Let's go. God damn it. The sound. It hurts. It hurts. It really does
[7021.53s -> 7037.34s]  hurt. Oh. Let me just get these all open. Give me that. Oh my under. My armpits are itchy right
[7037.34s -> 7041.42s]  now after that. I don't know. Is there any doctors in here that can tell me why that is?
[7045.05s -> 7055.50s]  Why do I have itchy armpits after being scared? Wait. It looks like I can jump off the ladder.
[7055.50s -> 7079.99s]  You doofus. I don't want to be up there because I can see. There's the red door.
[7082.66s -> 7086.26s]  I can get that gun. There's an extra sword. What is it? But if you already have a sword,
[7086.26s -> 7104.55s]  what's the point? Rifle. Let's just use it. I think we're clear. I thought that was yellow.
[7104.63s -> 7112.42s]  There's a red door and then a red door and then red door. There we go. There was no reason for that
[7112.42s -> 7115.86s]  to happen. There was no reason for what just happened to happen. You know what I'm saying?
[7116.66s -> 7128.86s]  There was no reason for that. I don't have any morale. I'm dead. What the fuck? Let's just grab
[7128.86s -> 7135.51s]  the key and instantly scream in front of me. Guy. Oh. All right. Well, I've got to be aware of that.
[7136.63s -> 7162.82s]  Shit. Give me this health. All right. Here's my ammo that I wanted and I fell.
[7163.86s -> 7177.13s]  Kill that guy. Wait. What's in there? There's shit in there. Don't get that key. Get in there.
[7177.13s -> 7202.58s]  What's in here? Not bad. Shotgun. I need a big shotgun. I've got plenty of ammo. I think it's
[7202.58s -> 7211.91s]  time to start this. What do I have for my hunting rifle? Not 15. I want 15. I refuse to play unless
[7211.91s -> 7226.73s]  I have 15 hunting rifle ammo. It's the only way I feel comfortable is up there. Plus, I will not
[7226.73s -> 7231.53s]  do all this. I need to do ammo collection now because I won't do it later. You all know it.
[7232.25s -> 7265.02s]  That looks suspicious. All right. Wait. All right. Let's go. Wait. There's so many little
[7265.02s -> 7272.46s]  like nooks and crannies here. What does this do? A house opens. Which house? Another house? A house
[7272.46s -> 7304.66s]  opened? No. Too many things. Which house opened? Is this house? I can go in here.
[7307.70s -> 7317.78s]  What is this for? There's a lot of places to go here. I think this is the house, right?
[7318.50s -> 7329.61s]  Was that the house that opened? I don't know. Maybe another day I'll figure it out. Let's go.
[7332.49s -> 7365.53s]  Right off the bat. Too many of you. Jesus. How am I not hitting you? Oh, fuck. I forgot to
[7365.53s -> 7382.65s]  quick save it right before. Did I? No, I did. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. That was bad.
[7382.65s -> 7454.12s]  I forgot about the guys in the air. Let's go. Clean it up. That's how you get it done. Is it
[7454.12s -> 7471.21s]  Junko or Jungo? Tell us before a civil war starts. No, it's Junko. Like junk. It's not Jungo.
[7471.77s -> 7490.50s]  It's Junko. All that brother Junko. Imagine your name was Junko. Junk. J-U-N-K. Junko.
[7498.15s -> 7514.58s]  Like junky. No, not junky. That's not. Junko is. That's fine. Give me this. Didn't even use the
[7514.58s -> 7536.01s]  powerups either. All right. It's time. I got a red key. You gonna play this one on me? Huh? That's
[7536.01s -> 7551.34s]  why I saved it. Red door is up here somewhere. Where is it? Up that way? I know there's a weird
[7551.34s -> 7562.60s]  red door somewhere like hanging out over here. Sure thing. I'll take a secret. Found the double
[7562.60s -> 7573.67s]  shotgun. I'm so happy I went up here. I'd be naked without this. All right. What is that red? There
[7573.67s -> 7583.59s]  it is. Oh, really? Look at that guy over there. I'm just gonna hide behind here. Of course,
[7583.59s -> 7599.59s]  you're not gonna show your face. You're dealing with Junko. I would pity you. I wanted to kill
[7599.59s -> 7614.12s]  you without picking that up. I just killed somebody. What? There he is. I fucking can smell him.
[7625.66s -> 7638.98s]  Big guy. Don't go in the well. I'm gonna do it just because you told me not to.
[7641.16s -> 7683.96s]  Well, we're in some shit, aren't we? Erratic. Erratic. Got him. This is the door that opened.
[7683.96s -> 7695.91s]  I can climb any surface. Which thing do I climb? The tallest thing here. Where am I? No, go, go,
[7695.91s -> 7731.83s]  go, go. It was the tallest thing here. None of this matters. Do you drown in this game?
[7731.83s -> 7754.78s]  What's all this down here? Can I? I'm gonna drown. All right. How do I get out of here?
[7754.78s -> 7766.71s]  Monka. Oh, that's it. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Out, out, out, out. He can't fit through here,
[7766.71s -> 7802.42s]  right? Can he fit through this? I gotta get further away.
[7803.62s -> 7823.35s]  I wasn't gonna cheese that one. I've cheesed the last boss of the other encounter. I can't. Just
[7824.15s -> 7841.10s]  come on. There's a yellow key. The shadow sunk our city. His monsters stripped our bones.
[7841.98s -> 7878.28s]  The water rises. The bones are their dollars. Wait. I can swim around. All right. This sucks,
[7878.36s -> 7903.67s]  but this is actually kind of cool. Swimming around. Let me get that health. Bomb the wall.
[7903.67s -> 7918.60s]  Bomb the wall. Bomb the wall. What wall? Which wall do you want me to bomb? Bomb the wall. The
[7918.60s -> 7924.10s]  wall. In the wall. The wall. All right. Well, bye. You had your one chance to tell me where it was
[7924.82s -> 7929.93s]  and you had to be funny about it. You had to be cute about it.
[7931.03s -> 7963.43s]  What are those? I don't know what fish is now. And they're fast. What a dodge. Did you see that
[7963.43s -> 7978.57s]  dodge on his part? One fish, two fish, red fish, dead fish. I don't think that's how the Dr. Seuss
[7978.57s -> 8004.28s]  book goes. I can hold my breath for a very long time. Fish moly. Why you kill me? Is anybody else
[8004.28s -> 8010.52s]  convinced that fish moly is like 29 by 29 instead of 28 by 28? It's bigger. The emote is bigger.
[8011.48s -> 8042.44s]  Did it win? Are you winning? Crypt of the. More of this. No, I don't like not having.
[8042.44s -> 8047.80s]  Ah, okay. Sword time. No, super shocking. I hear a new enemy type. I hear breathing.
[8048.44s -> 8078.34s]  I already got the yellow key. All right, we win. I need my flashlights.
[8098.14s -> 8115.32s]  Oh, I just got. The door opened somewhere else. Oh, the yellow door is right behind me.
[8115.32s -> 8147.56s]  Okay, this is dead end. The basement door opened. Okay, red keys up here. Ah,
[8150.04s -> 8179.66s]  what's this? I blow it up. That's unfortunate. I hate this sound. I hate the sounds. I hate the
[8179.66s -> 8183.98s]  sound. I knew it! There's a new monster. I told you it was a new monster. It's a big scary, like,
[8183.98s -> 8215.19s]  big mouth frog guy. It's so stressful. What is. Okay. I hate this shit. Shotgun shells.
[8215.91s -> 8248.10s]  Thanks. I guess. It looks like we're going in here. I knew it! The chaos enthralls us.
[8248.66s -> 8268.25s]  The chaos crawls to me. Jesus Christ. Look at how much damage these things do. You guys are the
[8268.33s -> 8280.01s]  worst. What does that do? Uh, just to kind of avoid to get back.
[8301.35s -> 8321.37s]  I was trying to pre-fire him. I have 30. I have 20 health. Wrong way. I'm dead.
[8333.40s -> 8347.03s]  That was tricky. Who has a flashlight? There's a. I already have a sword. Why
[8347.03s -> 8349.35s]  does it want me to use the sword? I don't have enough morale to use the sword.
[8349.35s -> 8357.40s]  The closer they got, the more they suffered. I don't have enough morale for this. I need
[8357.40s -> 8384.18s]  to just use a. Who's in this one? Anybody? Can I just close myself in here? That's your secret.
[8384.18s -> 8406.90s]  Your secret is shotgun shells. That's not a very good secret. Don't tell anybody about my secret.
[8407.70s -> 8419.30s]  I'm getting closer to him. He's going to run down the hall. He's going to run down this hall.
[8420.02s -> 8423.38s]  Might as well make it. There's not even a hallway.
[8434.23s -> 8441.27s]  Wait. Wait. What? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. It's not a frog.
[8441.27s -> 8455.18s]  It's one of the invisible ones. Time out. There's a. They're, they're down here though.
[8463.64s -> 8468.28s]  It's definitely, uh, it's, I can't use that shit. It's going to kill me. I'm going to end up blowing
[8468.28s -> 8500.71s]  myself up. Is there a chest right here? No. I don't have a key. No. There's something else
[8500.71s -> 8523.27s]  to do here. I need to get the blue key up. I guess I can go up, up there. No. Did I go this way?
[8524.07s -> 8538.95s]  I've been this way. Did I miss something else? I mean, very clearly I can still hear that guy
[8538.95s -> 8561.99s]  breathing. Did I not go in one of these doors? What the fuck? Where, where is he? God.
[8563.16s -> 8570.60s]  Oh, this is not supposed to be a scary game. This is not supposed to be a scary game.
[8570.60s -> 8589.56s]  It's the flashlight. There's the key and I'm going to get swarmed. The second I turn around,
[8590.28s -> 8618.87s]  I'm going to spam mortars up the, up the, up the door. Safe for now.
[8626.81s -> 8632.25s]  I really don't like this level. It's too scary. It's too much. Can I blow that up?
[8633.05s -> 8653.22s]  The ladder there. Well, I'm going to use it if you want me to.
[8665.67s -> 8676.39s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where the fuck? He came all the way down the stairs and I didn't even see
[8676.39s -> 8710.25s]  you. Now I got 12 health. I got more. Deeper. Not yet. Hold that thought. Not deeper. That
[8710.25s -> 8717.48s]  opens somewhere else. That's definitely the door that opens when I press this button. Don't fall.
[8720.94s -> 8731.82s]  Deeper. I got stuck in the wall. Curve at the frog over here. Curve at the frog. Is it going to
[8731.82s -> 8745.75s]  kill me? All right. So let's get this going. I'm going for it. I'm going to move quick.
[8746.71s -> 8788.18s]  Ah. Oh, she spits. Where are you? Who's left? There's somebody left apparently. Where,
[8790.78s -> 8821.75s]  where are they? I have 14 health. Where are you? That's not health.
[8832.12s -> 8836.28s]  Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man.
[8836.92s -> 8858.31s]  Where you at? Where? Where is he? What is it? What is it? What's, what's, what's chasing me?
[8858.87s -> 8875.06s]  Give me all that stuff. I gotta use the assault rifle. Max ammo on it. Always use the thing you
[8875.06s -> 8894.47s]  have that has max ammo. That's a tip from a professional video game player. See? There's
[8894.47s -> 8908.92s]  my key. Super health. That's the red key for the red door. The owl clove opens. Where's the owl
[8908.92s -> 8927.14s]  clove? You want to help me out here? It's above you. Oh, wait, is there a secret up there?
[8928.10s -> 8992.39s]  No, the owl clove opens. Oh, you idiot. That's convenient. What the fuck? That's convenient.
[9008.90s -> 9022.12s]  Didn't find a secret. I got a couple of them. Is that beavis or butt head?
[9023.64s -> 9034.07s]  Both of them at the same time. Uh oh. Open environment. It's time to show off our skills.
[9035.19s -> 9053.91s]  You missed a secret. I don't care. I shouldn't have done that. Uh oh, here comes the army.
[9055.38s -> 9068.14s]  Sword only. Just kidding. That's a lie. Watch out for the, I was gonna say Burger King frog.
[9069.10s -> 9088.50s]  That, there's no, there's no Burger King frog, right? Okay, that's wave one. Let's, uh,
[9088.50s -> 9134.49s]  that's activated. Cool. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, why don't you make it hard for me?
[9140.95s -> 9167.75s]  I mean, you didn't read the biography of my character beforehand, unfortunately. You didn't
[9167.75s -> 9170.95s]  read the biography that says like, oh, watch out when he gets the sniper rifle. Don't go at him.
[9171.67s -> 9181.40s]  He's fucking lit with the sniper rifle. I got hit once. Yo, boohoo, got hit one time.
[9182.79s -> 9193.77s]  I, oh, he's a 99 percentile. I actually like this. This is fun. All right, let's do it with
[9193.77s -> 9210.07s]  the crossbow. What's hitting me? Oh, what happened? Okay. That was bullshit. I didn't even see them.
[9210.63s -> 9217.66s]  I didn't even see them. The problem is, I mean, what was I thinking? That's the problem right here.
[9217.66s -> 9258.34s]  These things are following me around in a circle. Let's get some health. Good. Over here, health.
[9261.66s -> 9271.51s]  All right. Cool. Let's do some mortars. Good job, Jerma, you fucking stupid dipshit idiot.
[9272.55s -> 9287.18s]  Okay, I got everything I needed. Let's just activate the last one. What about in the
[9287.18s -> 9296.57s]  cathedral area itself? I think there's probably some things I didn't get. Yeah, there's some health
[9296.57s -> 9307.02s]  back here. Just making sure I get it all. All right, last one. Where is it? Mob that guy?
[9309.02s -> 9319.51s]  Don't mob that person. There's no reason to. It's not that one. I already got that one
[9320.39s -> 9389.08s]  back here. No, I got this one too. Where is it? There it is. Open. It's time for the final battle.
[9389.96s -> 9396.89s]  Whatever the hell's in here. Something's in here. Lots of shotgun ammo.
[9400.25s -> 9406.17s]  There it is. All right. I think, I think this is going to throw 10 times what I've done already
[9406.17s -> 9430.66s]  at me right now. When I press this button. Shoot this. I did it. The rising wind brings the stench
[9430.66s -> 9459.14s]  of rotten meat. Yeah. Okay. Uh, should I get out of here? No, that's a, how do I get away from the
[9459.14s -> 9497.21s]  tornado? It's coming for me. Do I have to leave the area? Let's go. Where is it? Okay. I have to go
[9497.21s -> 9510.98s]  around it. It's, it's changing trajectory. It's changing trajectory. Oh shit. Kill it. I can't,
[9510.98s -> 9524.58s]  you can't kill a tornado. Oh my fucking God. No, I have to go around it. You can't kill a tornado.
[9525.22s -> 9561.26s]  There's a way down. All right, here we go. Why does it know where I'm going? All right,
[9561.26s -> 9580.28s]  hurry up and go down. Wait, is there secrets in there? It's gone. Wait, this is what I'm supposed
[9580.28s -> 9591.14s]  to do. I thought that's what I was supposed to do. I thought I was supposed to escape the tornado.
[9598.17s -> 9607.13s]  Oh, all right. I'm sure I get all this stuff. I don't know what I was supposed to do.
[9607.69s -> 9617.40s]  I thought I was running away from the tornado. What is that? Magic egg backpack full of ammo.
[9618.04s -> 9645.82s]  Oh dear. I had 50 health. I just fell off. Okay. Well, that's a lot of you're coming up. Okay.
[9645.82s -> 9655.99s]  That's a lot of you coming up right now. This thing pushes you back.
[9663.11s -> 9665.75s]  He's fucking dead. Oh, I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kick his ass. I'm going to stab
[9665.75s -> 9672.92s]  his throat in his fucking throat. And when I get up there, it's you. Funny. Fuck. I didn't have any
[9672.92s -> 9693.54s]  morale. I thought I had enough morale to do that. Oh well. You thought, you thought it was like
[9693.54s -> 9728.42s]  funny. He went. I'm just going to kill him before they get up here. Fuck him. Where is he?
[9729.14s -> 9753.78s]  Just shooting his shotgun from this far away. Shooting the fucking ground. This guy's freaking
[9753.78s -> 9770.07s]  me out. Why does he not run up yet? Okay. Here we go. If he kills me again, sometimes you got to
[9770.07s -> 9789.80s]  just go in. Good. All right. Now we've got a door here. We've got a secret spot here. No.
[9794.10s -> 9826.60s]  You can take a lot of hits. It's all right though. Save it right here. Get in. I don't have a fucking
[9826.60s -> 9834.70s]  morale. Just kill me. I thought I had, why did I lose morale? 49 morale. Who? That doesn't give me
[9834.70s -> 9873.35s]  morale. Why are you even putting it on your bar? Now I got morale. Give me that. Well, I didn't
[9873.35s -> 9880.90s]  find it because I can't get it. I mean, sure. I found it, but I can't reach in there and get it.
[9881.78s -> 9916.22s]  Get out of the way. I thought these would flush the whole way. I thought they, I thought they would
[9916.22s -> 9921.58s]  flush. Every time I looked at it, it was like that right there. This is connected right there.
[9921.58s -> 9930.39s]  I'm moving around quickly and I thought it was connected or whatever. It's fine. All right. Where
[9930.39s -> 9939.93s]  am I going? Uh, get the super pistols. Not yet. All right. Super pistols and the door go.
[9941.29s -> 9946.07s]  There's nothing in here to do this with. Okay. Keep going. Find something to do. Find something
[9946.07s -> 9967.94s]  to kill. Quick. Find somebody to shoot at. Find anybody. Got him. I still don't have any keys.
[9968.82s -> 9989.43s]  Did I miss a key? Wait, do I have a key? No. Oh, there's a door. I would have loved that
[9989.43s -> 10016.73s]  fucking special movie. That was absolutely deranged. Yeah, I know. What would it say?
[10020.71s -> 10029.64s]  What am I going to tell you? Sorry. I was like, I was in the middle of talking.
[10032.18s -> 10037.46s]  I was like, oh, that's going to be, and then somebody just grabbed my sides and like squeezed
[10037.46s -> 10068.62s]  really hard. Like a squeaky toy. Red key. What happened? Why did I put it away? Why are they
[10068.62s -> 10072.78s]  freaking me out? Which way are they going? Okay. I gotta slow down. Wait, wait, wait. Why are you
[10072.78s -> 10079.42s]  taking out the signals? Why are the signals out? Okay. I saved it. I seriously, why is the signal
[10079.42s -> 10085.45s]  coming out? What was that all about? I like took this out and then all of a sudden the
[10085.45s -> 10093.93s]  signals got replaced and I lost all the health I had. That's so, so, uh, I'm actually upset right
[10093.93s -> 10101.54s]  now, but it's all right. Well, that's what the problem was. All right. If you don't, if there's
[10101.54s -> 10105.30s]  zero ammo in your gun, if you click, it just switches immediately to the next one. That was
[10105.30s -> 10137.42s]  the problem. That's when I got all fucked up. Where are these fools? Fool. That was fucking
[10137.42s -> 10160.78s]  really fast. Anybody else play video games here? Wait, I don't want to go through that yet.
[10161.50s -> 10169.99s]  Wasn't there a red one up here? I remember that being a red door and be going red door,
[10172.01s -> 10177.27s]  secret red door or something, right? Or am I making that up? No, I told you I wasn't making it up.
[10186.95s -> 10209.21s]  Riveter unlocked. I'm not going that way yet. It's just a, so that's the door I was thinking of. Okay.
[10209.21s -> 10220.98s]  Okay. Nothing in the crossbow, hunting rifle. Let's just move. This game is cool.
[10220.98s -> 10232.82s]  Laugh my ass off. Yeah, I know. Let it come through. Three, two, one, go.
[10235.51s -> 10247.26s]  What the hell? What was that? Don't watch it come all the way down, dummy.
[10248.86s -> 10287.96s]  Because I knew he was right here. There's like four of them here. I have to start using these.
[10287.96s -> 10298.38s]  Always use the one with max ammo and then collect ammo and then fight a boss with 40 health. Sounds
[10298.38s -> 10321.69s]  like a plan to me. Oh, you didn't even check behind the portal. I know the effects of the
[10321.69s -> 10334.20s]  fast fire totem will stack. So what you're saying is pistols get both fast fire things and just go
[10334.20s -> 10362.20s]  spam. I'll take it. Where am I? Okay. Where am I? Where am I? All right. We're good. I'm going to
[10363.00s -> 10378.66s]  do too much. I gotta stop drinking coffee. Save it. I know my large coffees. I thought that was a
[10378.66s -> 10395.22s]  guy. All right. Hold on. Where are these motherfuckers? Yeah, good. You got your cameo.
[10395.22s -> 10427.14s]  You got, you got to be on camera. All right. I still hear somebody. There's a lot of stuff in
[10427.14s -> 10432.42s]  the way though. There's a lot of things to pick up and a lot of places to go. Why don't we check out
[10432.42s -> 10437.70s]  down here? Look at that. Super bullets or something. I know. Okay. I'll take it. Sure.
[10437.70s -> 10459.05s]  What's up there? Who cares? Welcome to hell. Secret. Oh, what's on the other side?
[10460.01s -> 10487.62s]  I have bees. What's that? Another sword. I can go down here. Can I? Oh shit. Okay.
[10491.98s -> 10495.26s]  Red door. Wait, that's not a red door. Yes, it is. I have a red key. What are you dumb?
[10496.06s -> 10523.69s]  Back in the back of my mouse hole. Back in the mouse hole. Too many of them got
[10523.69s -> 10556.92s]  they got killed by a creeper. Oh my god. Fuck. Okay. Go up. Look at how much that is there.
[10556.92s -> 10570.26s]  But wait. What the hell? What? The reason why I'm opening all these doors at the same time.
[10570.82s -> 10650.25s]  Like a dope. You can't be serious with me. What? Retreat. Oh, what is in here? I shot over his head.
[10652.28s -> 10670.97s]  You got lucky. You on the other hand are still alive. Blue key. I'm kind of running an ammo.
[10671.53s -> 10704.17s]  I need every bit of health I can get right now. And there's still those guys here.
[10704.81s -> 10726.82s]  The frogs are still here somewhere. I can't slide under there. Fuck it. Whatever. I think I'm just
[10726.82s -> 10738.66s]  gonna go. I hate hearing that breathing sound. The heavy breathing drives me crazy because I know
[10738.66s -> 10750.33s]  somebody's here. This health and this ammo right here. Just fuck it. This rain health.
[10752.63s -> 10780.82s]  Sure. I guess. Whatever. Where is it? Where are you? I can hear his like stretchy pants.
[10781.46s -> 10793.14s]  Can you hear him? He's like spandex. Hey, you're the coolest fucking person I know. You're the
[10793.14s -> 10804.30s]  coolest person. Just step on the gas all the way down and flood your engine with gas and just go
[10804.30s -> 10811.83s]  really fast for five seconds. It's so awesome. You're so cool for doing that. Everything about
[10811.83s -> 10820.62s]  you. I wish I could meet you and hang out with you. I would assume that that person speaks in
[10820.62s -> 10832.97s]  one word sentences. Yeah. You like going real fast, huh? Yes. Okay. You know that's like you
[10832.97s -> 10855.10s]  can really like hurt somebody. I don't know. Oh, okay. But I go fast. Cool. Great. I hate sharing
[10855.10s -> 10873.37s]  the road with you. This place is condemned. Oh, there he is. Whoa. Don't look at me. Don't look
[10873.37s -> 10879.75s]  at me. Don't look at me. I don't have any clothes on. Where are my clothes? This is a nightmare.
[10879.75s -> 10906.22s]  I'm in a nightmare. Fuck you. It's doing the like super pog face. I'm gonna die. I have to.
[10906.22s -> 10908.70s]  Okay. What do I want to use? Hunting rifle? There's another one down here.
[10909.66s -> 10951.11s]  I think it's right behind. It's right behind the door. Nothing. Is he dead? He's dead.
[10951.11s -> 10958.55s]  There's another one though. Shit. Is that right there? Oh, no. Not this stuff. Not like this.
[10960.73s -> 10974.07s]  All right. Shotgun time. All right. I'm gonna put, I'm gonna block the doors so he can't go
[10974.07s -> 10979.72s]  around me. He cannot go in front of me. He can only come to my left and right.
[10980.52s -> 11007.43s]  No, just my left. He can't go through that front door. Okay. Well, I know this is only for bosses,
[11007.43s -> 11029.99s]  but there's rivets here. That's enough. Get the health in there. Oh shit. I don't know. Where am I
[11029.99s -> 11053.67s]  going? Oops. Where am I? How am I? God damn it, man. God damn it. Wait, there was just a chainsaw
[11053.67s -> 11059.51s]  guy. It wasn't even a frog. It wasn't even a frog. I can kill these guys in one shot. What a...
[11060.55s -> 11068.71s]  Seriously, that was what I was scared of? That's what I was so scared of. Unbelievable. Not even
[11068.71s -> 11080.73s]  a frog. But seriously though, I'm gonna do mortars, rivets for a little bit. Welcome back.
[11082.58s -> 11090.28s]  Two and then get you with two and then get you with two. And then that's all right. You're here.
[11090.28s -> 11095.32s]  You're right. Why would I shoot myself in the face with this? Don't ask me. I can't give you an answer.
[11096.84s -> 11121.56s]  All right. Let's move. There's one in here. Good. I need to do the slows. I want the health.
[11124.55s -> 11133.34s]  Rivets right there. I know you're gonna... Are you serious? Check. Turn. Why aren't you turning?
[11133.34s -> 11159.56s]  Turn. Excuse me. All right. Let's move. That's good. Now we've got to... I'm gonna do just these
[11159.56s -> 11196.36s]  shotguns. Go. No morale. Don't be... Don't make a mistake. I don't like when they do this shit.
[11196.36s -> 11224.23s]  It's too scary. No idea if this is the right way. No, I just... You're doing the hyper cam guy voice?
[11225.19s -> 11232.47s]  No, that's even the right way. I don't know. It could be. I don't know. Oh boy. This is where we move.
[11248.33s -> 11251.77s]  All right. Somebody teleported though. Somebody teleported. I heard it.
[11252.57s -> 11272.90s]  So when I go in there, I have to be ready. See? Where does this put me? All right. Let's just go
[11272.90s -> 11297.61s]  back. All right. What's up? I guess that this is the end. Pepe hands. What? See, I even checked
[11297.61s -> 11318.31s]  behind at this time. Nothing on here. I'm very proud of you. Press any key. Homecoming.
[11319.83s -> 11339.69s]  Let's get to full health almost. Welcome home. Hold on. I need to... I need to put back on my
[11340.65s -> 11354.55s]  my glued on grip from the Razer Deathadder. Yeah. You know what I'm going to say. I don't even need
[11354.55s -> 11361.26s]  to say it. You don't know. You don't even need to know what I'm going to say. You already have heard
[11361.26s -> 11369.05s]  it before. If you're in the store and there's two mice next to each other, one of them is a
[11369.05s -> 11376.10s]  like $100 Razer Deathadder and the other one is like an Amazon basics $12 mouse, that's the better
[11376.10s -> 11396.12s]  one. Like the default Microsoft mouse is better than this mouse. I'm serious. Imagine gluing on
[11396.12s -> 11415.96s]  grips. Can you imagine that? And they can come off. All right. I got everything I needed. Wait.
[11416.92s -> 11434.46s]  I mean, I kind of need to try. Oops. I didn't hit it.
[11438.38s -> 11464.70s]  Why am I not dead? Hey, thanks. Wait, I'm just... That's a lot of stuff flying around.
[11465.34s -> 11491.56s]  Oh, I got him. Nice. That... This is a secret. Is it really though? Yeah, I know. I'm playing with
[11491.56s -> 11508.65s]  bumpers. Yes. I'm at the bowling alley and I'm... What is that sound? I heard a sound. Wait, there's
[11508.65s -> 11513.77s]  some stuff to explore over there though. I'm not... I don't want to do this yet. I think this is like a...
[11513.77s -> 11534.55s]  I activate that or something. Oh, it's that thing. Why use two when you can use four? All right. What
[11534.55s -> 11540.38s]  does this do? I feel like if I touch that, I'm going to progress. I don't think I'm ready for
[11540.38s -> 11548.84s]  progress right now. Yeah, not yet. Hold on. I got the key. I want to go and see what's over there.
[11549.40s -> 11592.54s]  Okay. There's a house here. Stop laughing at your own jokes. Yeah. I was just... You are not fun.
[11593.10s -> 11611.83s]  Looking for health. I hear a little jingling of keys. Hey, any key jinglers here? Am I doing it
[11611.83s -> 11620.62s]  right? Well, sorry to intrude. Giant ball of skulls and death that lives in a regular house.
[11629.69s -> 11633.77s]  All right. I know there's going to be another one. What's in the basement? I don't know.
[11634.57s -> 11658.28s]  There's something in here. Look, very clearly there's a key. I think I'm supposed to touch
[11658.28s -> 11664.92s]  all these. Why did I do that? No. Touch it again. Touch it again. Touch it again. I don't want to
[11664.92s -> 11681.90s]  do that. No. I didn't even get to see what was in the basement. No. I didn't get to see... No. I
[11681.90s -> 11688.20s]  never know what's going to be in the basement now. Where am I going? What the fuck is happening?
[11688.92s -> 11700.30s]  Touch that. No. I need to touch that. Okay. I got to touch that one. I got to grab this one.
[11701.02s -> 11726.90s]  Okay. Go this way. And where is it? Oh. Is this door open? Oh, shit. I missed it. Oh.
[11726.90s -> 11762.81s]  Oh. I needed to be normal again. Whoops. I... Where's the world? Okay. Load the save.
[11765.35s -> 11774.41s]  It hurts my brain so bad. Just reach that. I can't even... I need to hit that again.
[11778.95s -> 11795.19s]  I actually think I'm fucked. I'm somehow moving further and further away. I think I can't do
[11795.19s -> 11833.74s]  anything. I can't turn. I can't move. I can't... Wait. What? Oh. Um. Okay. I need to see what's
[11833.74s -> 11874.92s]  in the basement. What are you doing down here, man? There's nothing in here? I guess there was
[11874.92s -> 11884.04s]  health down here. So it wasn't even worth coming down here. Why'd you do that, dude? He was just
[11884.04s -> 11895.43s]  fucking vibing. Well, I don't... I don't know. I don't care. All right. Now I'm going to try to...
[11895.43s -> 11905.35s]  I have the blue key. Here we go. Ready? Flip it. And then... Which way am I standing? Okay.
[11905.35s -> 11911.53s]  This is the way I'm standing. I'm going... All right. Where the hell am I? All right. So
[11912.57s -> 11926.79s]  I need to get a button. So I'm no longer here. There's a button. Let's get hit by this tree.
[11929.69s -> 11940.07s]  No! Almost had it. What about this one? Can I get hit by it? Let me get stuck here. Through this...
[11940.07s -> 11968.73s]  All right. I'm in a new house. I hear it. Oops. All right. Well. Um. Okay. Now if I go...
[11972.36s -> 11976.52s]  There's a switch that I have to hit. I saw it. It was over here somewhere. Like, right...
[11977.08s -> 12016.12s]  It's right there. Where is it? Where's that switch? Oh, there was a... What was that? All right.
[12016.12s -> 12020.12s]  In the barn is another switch, but that's just gonna make it right side up. I think I have to
[12020.12s -> 12037.61s]  actually, like, travel around like this. All right. Where am I now? Can I get in the barn like this?
[12039.46s -> 12073.83s]  Right there? All right. I'm in the barn. Shit. No. I can't reach that. How can I do a rivet jump?
[12073.83s -> 12080.55s]  Ah. As I said, I'm hurting myself and not hitting it. What happens if I go through here? All right.
[12080.55s -> 12089.88s]  There's that. But I'm not on the right plane. You know what I'm saying? I need to get, like, that way.
[12090.44s -> 12105.58s]  So I gotta flip it. Shit. Can I... Can I get up there? Maybe I can. I'm almost lined up.
[12106.30s -> 12112.87s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm on this island now.
[12113.43s -> 12118.17s]  But which way am I going? I gotta go... Not quite. Not quite. Not quite. Not quite. Not...
[12119.45s -> 12150.90s]  Just don't move. I thought I... I gotta hit that... What happens if I press this button, though?
[12151.38s -> 12173.94s]  There's health here. Got it. What? What the fuck? What did it open? I don't even... I have no idea
[12173.94s -> 12183.14s]  what it opened. Um, where the hell am I? Holy shit. This is the most disorienting thing I've ever done.
[12184.39s -> 12197.26s]  Uh, I... Where am I even aiming? All right. Got one. I need to go right. I'm gonna throw up.
[12197.98s -> 12204.60s]  I'm gonna throw up. I have to hit this and spin around. I got one shot at this.
[12206.65s -> 12225.82s]  I didn't get it. All right. I... Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. There's a blue... I'm at the blue door.
[12226.54s -> 12255.77s]  Okay. Let's... Let's go. Oh, no. I don't want to... Do I have to press that? Oh, no.
[12261.42s -> 12266.52s]  Do I have to press that? Do I have to? Wait. It's like there's two of them in here.
[12268.89s -> 12278.94s]  Just... Aye, aye, aye. What is this? The neighboring garage opens. Don't do this yet.
[12291.53s -> 12301.48s]  These guys in here. How can I be... Hello? How can I be here? What's this screaming for?
[12309.27s -> 12309.75s]  Somebody.
[12319.58s -> 12335.43s]  Okay. Oh, man. So, what's the actual end goal here? What's the end game here? Computer? And
[12335.43s -> 12344.49s]  that computer don't have time to play with myself. No, I don't. Is it to get in the barn like this?
[12346.54s -> 12354.82s]  Or... I'm not sure what this wants me to do. Let's see. Wait. Okay. I'm upside down now.
[12354.82s -> 12359.37s]  This one just makes you go upside down. I know this soap in there. Don't worry.
[12360.26s -> 12365.64s]  So, if I just go upside down, that means I have to get to the upside down one like this.
[12368.52s -> 12378.81s]  I've made it to this island. There's also another island that has stuff on it like that one. No.
[12378.81s -> 12388.25s]  Where is it? Somewhere around here, isn't it? I know. I know about that. But wasn't there
[12388.25s -> 12396.63s]  another one of these? Smaller, with a bunch of stuff on it? Where was that? Oh, whatever.
[12401.22s -> 12410.54s]  I'm trying to... What? Where's my... That's the one right there. That's what I'm looking for.
[12410.54s -> 12424.26s]  Good thing this stopped. Do it again. Yeah, I knew there was one of these. There. See?
[12424.98s -> 12443.00s]  All right. That was worth doing. What about that? No. Okay. It's time. Just be ready.
[12443.00s -> 12476.31s]  Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? I'm talking about none of those. Hit him. Dude.
[12491.21s -> 12494.09s]  How did he get missed that many times? Look at how small this area is.
[12495.13s -> 12507.72s]  What? Those are some... That's a pixel perfect missing, apparently. Fake health box. All right.
[12507.72s -> 12526.74s]  Let's spin. This is going to be puke inducing. There's a key. Okay. I got to get that key.
[12529.02s -> 12540.14s]  Yellow key. Got it? No. Yellow door. Over there. So...
[12549.50s -> 12560.76s]  Oh, I'm at the end. That one was a little bonkers. Almost perfected. I wasn't about
[12560.76s -> 12572.26s]  to go try to find the third secret there. That was a puke level. As above, so below.
[12572.26s -> 12594.25s]  This is the very beginning. Oh, it's not there. What the fuck?
[12604.57s -> 12613.03s]  Okay. Trying to get on this ledge. I did. But is there any... No, nothing here.
[12613.03s -> 12632.15s]  I would put a secret here. Oh, never mind. They're all like this. Full morale. Yellow door.
[12633.19s -> 12651.46s]  Oh, might as well fill it up. I'm going to keep the sword out for now. Never mind.
[12656.02s -> 12658.90s]  Would have loved to have picked up that hunting rifle ammo.
[12658.90s -> 12698.04s]  Health. I'll take a secret. Ooh, nice. Yes. That's exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
[12703.75s -> 12721.50s]  Break it. Why can't... Rivet gun. Save it. I'm probably nearing the end of the episode.
[12722.22s -> 12728.84s]  What is it? 10 episodes? 10 levels per episode? Something like that. Let's get up there.
[12728.84s -> 12764.23s]  Okay, switch guns. That was dumb. Ready, go! I hear a lady.
[12771.51s -> 12799.83s]  There's two of them. Go into the light, Jeremy. I didn't plan on it. All right, I'm going to have...
[12800.47s -> 12823.98s]  Let's do these two on switch. Oh, boy. Never mind. Oh, boy. Why?
[12825.74s -> 12836.97s]  Please die. Please die. Please die. This game is so stressful, but it's so fun.
[12837.61s -> 12878.94s]  Where are you? All right, I want shotgun and mortars for my switches. Godlike.
[12884.47s -> 12922.73s]  And then I go and do something like that. Give me health. What was that? What is... Who's firing
[12922.73s -> 12934.20s]  in here? It's you! I just saved it right there. Save it down here because I don't want to die there.
[12943.00s -> 12955.24s]  Oh, my fuck. She's coming down the stairs, man. Don't blow that up. It's gonna hit me.
[12956.60s -> 12977.58s]  I hate these things. I can go get those. What do I have for a... Yeah, I'm gonna get crossbow ammo.
[12978.30s -> 12983.32s]  Okay, there's a fire... There's a Mario slide portion of this level coming up right here.
[12983.32s -> 13000.04s]  But let me get everything. There's another person. How's are they in? Are they in here with me?
[13004.25s -> 13012.04s]  What? Open. What's the point of this? What's the point of that? What's the point of this?
[13014.09s -> 13040.54s]  I don't think there's a point. All right, secret health, but I don't need it.
[13051.27s -> 13073.90s]  Okay, I see where you are. I see where you are. Holy shit! Okay, we're just bombing it. Hello?
[13075.40s -> 13096.55s]  Oh! What happened there? One, two, three. Great. Where were you? I don't... Guys,
[13096.55s -> 13100.58s]  she was in the bottom floor of the house. How many times did I pass you?
[13100.58s -> 13123.13s]  Did she go up a tree? Oh, something activated.
[13125.27s -> 13135.08s]  All right, don't go in here yet. I want to take care of this shit. Let's get in here. Same deal.
[13136.38s -> 13150.34s]  Now I can chill and bomb it. That's gonna hurt me, isn't it? What the fuck just happened?
[13152.70s -> 13180.30s]  What just happened? Fuck it, we're going in. People are in here. There's so many people in here.
[13181.02s -> 13205.94s]  There's so many people. All right, there's like three of those whispering ladies in here.
[13207.96s -> 13236.18s]  Now, what does this get me? I heard a beep. All right, interesting. Anything else in here?
[13236.90s -> 13245.78s]  Wait, this just takes me all the way back to... Wait, what? Why would I want to come back here?
[13246.58s -> 13265.50s]  This is the... Oh, the fuck? Hold on. H-E-I. No, that's right. That's where this yellow key is.
[13265.66s -> 13275.08s]  All right. Well, let's get the hell out of here. Guys, what is going on right now? Where the fuck
[13275.08s -> 13295.56s]  am I going? What just happened? This is like really, really far away. What? I'm so confused.
[13295.56s -> 13304.09s]  This may as well have been six hours ago. All right, here's the house. All right, I made it.
[13305.13s -> 13309.53s]  All right, so that was not the way I should have... Okay, I have to get... Right, right, right.
[13309.53s -> 13329.80s]  But I gotta get the... I gotta go down here. I don't have very much time to use this.
[13333.66s -> 13351.35s]  Is it just death down there? I think that you just die. I gotta find out. I'm not sure I'm
[13351.35s -> 13354.39s]  supposed to do that. I mean, why would I be able to come all the way down here though?
[13359.32s -> 13371.91s]  There's nowhere else to go. I knew it. I knew it. So what was the point of this? Is that a secret?
[13371.91s -> 13404.01s]  I guess. He's answering himself. I guess I go... I didn't get a yellow key yet,
[13404.65s -> 13409.83s]  and that's what I'm looking for. Was there a yellow key somewhere up here that I missed?
[13410.39s -> 13415.06s]  Like through here? Because this wraps all the way around. Don't go down.
[13415.86s -> 13446.17s]  Just go across. All right, maybe this is the way to go. Trust your eyes. Now we're all the way back
[13446.17s -> 13475.16s]  again where we were last time. I'm just going to rocket jump up. What the... Oh, it's the wrong
[13475.16s -> 13515.29s]  button. Wrong one. It's this one. Keep moving. Where are you? I can hear you. Where is he? Above
[13515.29s -> 13554.65s]  me? There you are. There you are. Oh, and you came through the door. Those things move a lot.
[13573.94s -> 13598.70s]  Oh, he hit me right in the face. Jesus. This dog... Stress. Stress. Stress. Stress. Stress.
[13599.50s -> 13605.85s]  Stress him out. Stress him out. Stress him out. Stress him out. Stress him out. What else do we
[13605.85s -> 13609.29s]  got? Anything? Any more food here for me to... for my guns? Any more food for my guns?
[13610.54s -> 13623.37s]  Yes, there is. And food gun. Maxon hunting rifle. There we go. Wait, what's this?
[13624.25s -> 13670.63s]  Weird little door back here. I can hear you wailing. There you are. This is a long stairway.
[13671.51s -> 13699.32s]  What's this? Cast machine? I guess there's some stuff down here. Hey! Where is he? He's in the
[13699.32s -> 13711.13s]  teleporter. Great. He's lighting his shotgun up to my head. He was just waiting for me.
[13712.01s -> 13744.60s]  All right, give me a second. Well, I'm trying to... I didn't... Didn't I get another key?
[13745.56s -> 13758.47s]  I swear I did. Somebody's sprinting down here, I think. You're not. We're good.
[13760.36s -> 13785.58s]  You eat 5G gum? I'm chewing 5G gum. All right, that's real funny. I mean, just hilarious, dude.
[13786.22s -> 13794.02s]  Absolutely hysterical. Funniest person. Hey, actually, it's a shortcut. Thanks for the
[13794.02s -> 13832.44s]  shortcut. Appreciate it. Good. Sweet. You want to play that game? I can play that game.
[13834.52s -> 13846.76s]  Get out of here. Take that. Memories dry and crumble.
[13854.46s -> 13864.74s]  This game's too hard for you? I'm about to finish the game on the hardest difficulty.
[13865.38s -> 13878.01s]  What are you talking about? Yeah, I think you should, like, I think you should, like, put...
[13879.53s -> 13884.09s]  You gotta throw in the towel, man. You're, like, you're, like, 42 minutes from beating the whole
[13884.09s -> 13888.01s]  game on the second hardest difficulty. I think, you know, maybe you should throw in the towel now.
[13888.01s -> 13908.81s]  This is time for you to throw in the towel. Yeah, now is it. Do it now. Where is it? What the hell
[13908.81s -> 13917.96s]  is he? He's freaking me out wherever he is. Why did you even fit through the door? Why did he even
[13917.96s -> 13932.33s]  get in the door? He's really... You can't fit through there, man. No way. You don't fit through
[13932.33s -> 13975.24s]  that door. Let's go. Okay. Take out both of these. Now, watch out for the dog.
[13976.76s -> 14000.62s]  I don't even know where he came from. He kind of just showed up. Where is he? He's gonna...
[14001.98s -> 14047.00s]  Through this wall. Okay, got you. Oh! He can hit me through the grate. Sorry. I just negated
[14047.00s -> 14058.46s]  everything he just did. Stop commentating. Just win the game. This streaming shit is distracting
[14058.46s -> 14066.12s]  you. All right, I'll turn... Let me turn my stream off for a few hours, guys. I'll see you later.
[14070.71s -> 14072.39s]  Dude, you need to turn off your stream.
[14075.18s -> 14080.63s]  Did I really just get a, dude, turn off your stream comment? Did that really just happen?
[14085.51s -> 14096.86s]  Dude, just turn off your stream. What the fuck? All right, hold on. I got... I'm ready to move
[14096.86s -> 14107.30s]  forward. Dude, this streaming thing is like... You gotta just complete the circle. I have to...
[14107.94s -> 14142.87s]  But this is the beginning of the game. Dweller in the darkness. Okay. I mean, you can clearly see
[14142.87s -> 14184.38s]  that. Oh, you're gonna give me a soap? Don't give me a soap right before one of the last boss?
[14185.10s -> 14198.09s]  Am I actually gonna get a soap here? Holy shit. This is a lot of stuff. Okay.
[14198.97s -> 14200.57s]  Just remember... Okay. Let's go.
[14220.04s -> 14229.58s]  Holy fuck. All right. What's a better hunting rifle? No.
[14230.94s -> 14263.30s]  Salt rifle. Yeah. Take out a little guys first. That's planned. Just spawning still.
[14264.82s -> 14323.80s]  Oh, it hit me. Found the sword. Good. Now what? Oh, all right. Let's keep... Let's keep... It
[14323.80s -> 14334.78s]  keeps rolling. It keeps rolling. It keeps rolling. Fuck. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Give me this...
[14363.26s -> 14397.91s]  Go up. Holy... Thanks for the help, man. Don't kill me. Oh my god. There's so many of those
[14397.91s -> 14405.02s]  bullets firing over at me. Oh, there's so many of these bullets firing over here.
[14416.65s -> 14431.42s]  Oh no. No. I didn't save the... I didn't save the game. Oh shit. God. That's insane.
[14433.24s -> 14440.22s]  All right. Fuck. That's hard. I gotta do the same thing from before. Let's go.
[14441.10s -> 14452.07s]  But different. Here we go. Watch this. I have a better strategy than this.
[14452.95s -> 14459.08s]  Salt rifle is not good for this. I really should just... No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
[14459.08s -> 14468.81s]  No. Kill me. Kill me. Bad start. Kill me. Kill me. I'm gonna use the... I think I'm just gonna use
[14468.81s -> 14475.00s]  hunting rifle. No. No. No. No. What am I gonna do here? What do I want to use? Crossbow?
[14475.00s -> 14490.15s]  Maybe the crossbow. I need crossbow ammo. Is there even crossbow ammo here?
[14491.27s -> 14497.22s]  I wonder if I... Can I actually take a second? Probably not.
[14510.02s -> 14516.89s]  I think I'm just tilted from the last round. Yeah, that's absolutely what's happening.
[14518.33s -> 14540.49s]  Bye. All right. All right. Start over. Regain strength. I'm gonna do the same thing at the
[14540.49s -> 14549.93s]  last time. Salt rifle. Get rid of the guys on the ground. Salt rifle. Get rid of the guys on the
[14549.93s -> 14556.06s]  ground. Let me see how... Does this just activate if I walk forward? Or can I actually look around
[14556.06s -> 14560.15s]  for a second? Now I get the music starting, right? Yeah. Okay. You just have to go.
[14561.43s -> 14586.90s]  If that ran into anyone, holy fuck. That was kind of a mistake. That's like too much.
[14588.12s -> 14601.66s]  Yeah. That's way too much. Too quick. Where's my... Just hit six. Give me a break.
[14601.90s -> 14626.74s]  God damn it. Oh, fuck. I got all the time in the world. Don't rush it.
[14628.10s -> 14644.36s]  I'm gonna leave one person alive. That's the strategy here. Okay. Let's pick up some shit.
[14645.56s -> 14649.69s]  Did I actually get hit by the one fucking little asshole that's right here?
[14650.41s -> 14664.28s]  Okay. Got health. Oh, this is over here. Morrell. Okay. What's up next?
[14664.92s -> 14675.21s]  I gotta be ready for it. Up next is... All right. That's a good save point. I think I'm gonna do...
[14676.33s -> 14681.19s]  Let's just go. I think it's... I don't remember, but we'll just fucking deal with it when it happens.
[14682.07s -> 14736.38s]  Oh, it's a shotgun guys, right? Oh my fucking lord. That's a lot of people. Fuck you twice.
[14737.98s -> 14759.35s]  Fuck you a third time. Ah. I'm not prepared for what's next. What is next? It's just these idiots.
[14760.15s -> 14821.54s]  What is he? Stupid. I almost had an ammo. Okay. Now it's just the mad scientists that are running at
[14821.54s -> 14851.62s]  me. I can handle this. I need ammo for a gun. Is that it? What's that? The invisible. The invisible.
[14851.62s -> 14897.30s]  Invisible. Invisible. Invisible. Invisible. Invisible. Everybody sick? Everybody getting
[14897.30s -> 14967.72s]  sick? I was getting sick. I had to stop. Oh my fuck. That's a bad idea right now. Whoa. You're
[14967.80s -> 14988.70s]  spawning on me, bro. You're spawning. I'm gonna charge up over there. Oh. It's too many. It's too
[14988.70s -> 15005.66s]  much. It's too much. It's too much, man. It's too much. Oh, I can't even... You can't even slow down
[15005.66s -> 15028.04s]  either. You can't even slow down. I'm dead. Oh my god. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay. I have to start
[15028.04s -> 15035.61s]  saving it. Oh, okay. Slow down. Fuck me. Oh, yeah. Right this part with the fucking animals.
[15037.24s -> 15074.52s]  Where are they? Dude, jumping like this is gonna give me a fucking brain aneurysm. It's gonna run.
[15087.13s -> 15091.78s]  These guys. I'll do anything with these guys. These guys.
[15093.05s -> 15107.74s]  Oh, fuck. I have to do this for a second. You can't do that for that long without having your hands
[15107.74s -> 15159.06s]  come off the keyboard. I'm gonna just snipe. It's much easier. Now we have to do this stuff.
[15159.06s -> 15163.06s]  It's crossbow time. Don't get overwhelmed. Just get them all before they spawn. Get them all when
[15163.06s -> 15228.82s]  they spawn. Damn it. Okay. Fuck. I gotta use the shotgun for a little bit. Oh,
[15235.22s -> 15240.66s]  how are you still alive, man? What a flying goddamn diaper.
[15248.79s -> 15254.86s]  I've expelled like all my energy. I don't have any energy left. I just quick saved and got hit
[15254.86s -> 15263.02s]  in the air by this fucking dog. I hope that's it. That's not it. Save it right here. Oh my god,
[15263.02s -> 15277.21s]  please. Save it right here. What is it? What is it? I don't understand. Is it the dog?
[15279.91s -> 15313.53s]  It's rats. They're just on the ground. I'm not gonna kill the last one. This is my break. Okay,
[15313.53s -> 15330.97s]  this is my break. Any other items that I can pick up and get health? Rats, rats, rats, rats.
[15332.17s -> 15341.26s]  I want to get into this next little... Where is he? I can hear him. He's gonna probably kill me.
[15341.26s -> 15347.14s]  Imagine if he killed me. I would cry on stream. I would turn the webcam on and just cry for you
[15347.14s -> 15369.45s]  guys. Okay, and 84 health. There he is. All these bullets. 86 health. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.
[15369.45s -> 15409.30s]  Whatever it is. See ya. Go left, left, left. I have to go to the bathroom. I'm gonna pee.
[15410.26s -> 15421.11s]  Yeah, I gotta pee. Even if I do it, I have to pee. I should be okay though. Although I'm at 11 health.
[15424.76s -> 15437.62s]  Oh yeah, I have to pee. And I need a break, man. I'll be right back. I gotta pee.
[15568.86s -> 15582.22s]  Dude, the temperature in this room is probably like 95 degrees. I'm heating up this room.
[15582.86s -> 15592.10s]  Fucking intense, man. All right, let's go. I shook around a little bit. I stretched.
[15593.30s -> 15599.72s]  Whoa. All right, where are we at? Oh yeah, it's just a rat. Just a rat. Okay, so the next thing
[15599.72s -> 15608.49s]  that comes up is the chainsaw guys, which are one shot with this gun. All right, let me see if that
[15608.49s -> 15638.95s]  helps. You're not dead? I'm just gonna hit by a double-barreled shotgun. Oops.
[15642.68s -> 15650.36s]  No, you can't. If you stop moving, you are dead. You're just dead. Like, you gotta just keep the
[15650.36s -> 15675.14s]  hook. Hook. Hook. Hook. Or you're just dead. Guaranteed dead. What's that? What's that? What's
[15675.14s -> 15682.22s]  that? What? I just, what happened? I thought that was a new enemy. Oh, it's swordsmen and ladies.
[15693.26s -> 15700.86s]  Oh man, this is not good. And it's the ladies. I just stay on the outside. Oh fuck, man. Okay,
[15700.86s -> 15704.06s]  I gotta relax. I even know how the hell do you relax like this.
[15711.66s -> 15730.71s]  They're just like kind of killing each other. Y'all think I'm gonna be crazy. You think it's
[15730.71s -> 15741.53s]  gonna be I'm crazy, but I'm gonna get. No, not yet. Okay. Look at all this health everywhere.
[15748.33s -> 15773.51s]  Ah, just pick it all up quick. Watchers up the gate. Oh, oh shit. This health pack in the middle.
[15773.51s -> 15780.63s]  I gotta go in the middle. I gotta go in the middle. I gotta get this health pack in the middle.
[15782.47s -> 15784.30s]  Oh, I can't do that. That's not gonna happen.
[15809.27s -> 15812.47s]  Health pack. Health pack. Health pack. Holy fuck. I'm dead. No.
[15817.98s -> 15841.78s]  He's still bouncing around. Yeah. All right. What about this like this guy, this like Jason?
[15843.45s -> 15848.42s]  Nope. Down. All right. I'm gonna take out. I don't even know what I'm gonna do here to get
[15848.42s -> 15853.70s]  this health if I can. I gotta take out one of the horses. Yeah, dude. The horse has gotta go first.
[15856.42s -> 15859.78s]  Like they just got a great. I'm glad I walked in this killing.
[15860.58s -> 15873.91s]  Don't no, no, no, no. We got really goodness gracious. This is on. This is ridiculous.
[15875.42s -> 15881.51s]  This dialed up by a thousand. Whatever my ammo.
[15885.99s -> 15924.73s]  Imagine if you still have the soap. Don't remind me of my failure. It wasn't bad. Trying to get the
[15924.73s -> 15962.30s]  dogs. Oh, that hurt. Oh, that was, that was insane. That was ridiculous. That was fuck crazy.
[15962.94s -> 15978.49s]  That was fun. But that was nuts. Can you imagine playing that if you get hit once you die?
[15980.31s -> 15984.87s]  Taking, you die, you die in one hit. Oh, I would, I don't know if I'd be able to do that one.
[15984.87s -> 15998.15s]  Let's make sure I got everything. Even every little tiny little crumb of every crust of health.
[15998.95s -> 16021.02s]  I'm picking it up. Okay. There it is. So now what? Just through the door. Okay.
[16032.65s -> 16048.15s]  Damn. What was the one secret? What did I miss? It was the thing at the start.
[16050.76s -> 16076.10s]  What? I could have actually done that. Dusk. Okay. I've got ammo in the house away.
[16079.05s -> 16082.49s]  Crystal. Left crystal of madness. I'm not doing that.
[16084.57s -> 16098.60s]  I'm not going to lift up the crystal of madness just yet.
[16104.07s -> 16106.07s]  Stuff that's in there. Just want to make sure I have everything.
[16107.88s -> 16152.28s]  Is this the actual final final battle? What's up here? I would, I would make a comment on it,
[16152.28s -> 16158.76s]  but why would I end? Guys, there's a soap here. Why could I use the soap and whip it into the
[16158.76s -> 16168.82s]  last box? Okay. Let's keep the soap over there for emergency scenario.
[16170.26s -> 16192.76s]  Now let's go pick up that crystal over here. All right. It's been a fun game.
[16194.04s -> 16219.69s]  It's time to see how it ends. Are you going to come out of there or do I have to go in?
[16219.69s -> 16253.42s]  And with my soap, you finally arrived. You shall be my final test.
[16261.05s -> 16314.44s]  That started quickly. Jacob. I got to be moving already. You finally arrived. You
[16315.08s -> 16330.07s]  shall be my final test. I'm going too fast.
[16332.71s -> 16335.72s]  Okay. That was a mistake.
[16378.76s -> 16428.49s]  Kill him. Unworthy. Unworthy. Just in case I saw off lock myself. He was worthy and he accomplished
[16430.14s -> 16433.02s]  there. You should stop streaming. This game's not for you.
[16446.76s -> 16451.30s]  Who did you expect at the end of all of this?
[16452.90s -> 16462.76s]  God, the devil, perhaps it's just me.
[16463.48s -> 16479.62s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is this? Okay. I need to, um, I found a secret.
[16479.62s -> 16494.70s]  How do you kill this guy under over his, in his glue, in his body, in his face,
[16495.58s -> 16511.70s]  explosives, the light, the light. What's going on? I need to get him in the light.
[16512.50s -> 16521.45s]  Okay. I need to save it like right when he's about to be done talking.
[16530.14s -> 16548.41s]  He was worthy and he accomplished so. You who were faster. You.
[16548.41s -> 16552.41s]  I can't save it. I have to save it while I'm falling.
[16553.78s -> 16557.06s]  Who did you expect at the end of all of this?
[16558.66s -> 16570.62s]  God, it's just me. It's just me. And here we go.
[16570.62s -> 16601.32s]  Oh, damn it. What? That's what you do. Got it. Okay. What? Wait, I, I, this is all this stuff
[16601.32s -> 16606.70s]  on the particle fix. If I hurt my head, I'm like looking. All right. So there's another crack.
[16607.58s -> 16620.94s]  All right. I don't have to do that. Okay. Okay. He swings. Then he goes to go get to jump over
[16620.94s -> 16628.42s]  his arm. Got it again. All right. I figured it out. Oh, man. I'm going to do that a thousand
[16628.42s -> 16633.93s]  times. It's going to end up killing me. It's all the green, man. It's messing with my brain.
[16634.89s -> 16655.27s]  I have to restart. Just die. It's, it's all the green is causing me problems. Where is it?
[16655.27s -> 16684.07s]  There's a light. Where's it going? Fuck. Oh, yeah. Move your hand. Move your hand.
[16685.03s -> 16703.38s]  Fucking God, man. You didn't get it.
[16716.50s -> 16730.06s]  How do I, can I shoot with my regular?
[16756.63s -> 16759.43s]  I don't want it. I want to spread it equally to everybody on earth.
[16760.23s -> 16779.02s]  How do they get pacifist? What was the secret completionist and pacifist?
[16795.46s -> 16796.42s]  I like that last touch.
[16816.84s -> 16823.99s]  Must always rain beneath dust.
[16831.10s -> 16843.18s]  My brothers have escaped you. My brothers will not die in vain.
[16846.97s -> 16866.74s]  That was really, really fun. So what did I do? It's just throw in the towel. This is not,
[16866.82s -> 16883.59s]  this game's not for you. That's like one of my favorite comments of the whole stream.
[16890.46s -> 16901.50s]  Like that was, it was, it was funny. So that was dusk, but I'm not done with dusk.
[16902.14s -> 16908.07s]  There's another game mode that I want to try where you have to fight waves. I'd like to try it.
[16910.33s -> 16916.34s]  Play the rat level. This is fine to see where I will find the secret rat level. That's fine.
[16924.68s -> 16932.63s]  Finally. Yes. Check out amid evil. I'm going to do that next. I was looking at that actually
[16932.63s -> 16942.10s]  last night. We're not going to play that now though. We're probably going to do that.
[16947.06s -> 16961.18s]  Is that one of them? When you look dead. All right. Let's do endless. All right. So
[16961.18s -> 16981.59s]  let me give you a rundown. That was, that was very, very good. Very good. 9.3.
[16987.74s -> 16991.66s]  I had to, I was 9.4, but there was that one part with the vents. Remember I was,
[16991.66s -> 17002.84s]  I was going up and down and I had to drop it by a point, by a tenth of a point. 9.3. That's very
[17002.84s -> 17014.79s]  high. It is something about the shooting mechanics in this game felt just way more fun than other FPS
[17014.79s -> 17021.98s]  games. Now I actually liked this game a lot because a lot of the old school shooters,
[17022.54s -> 17030.20s]  they were like the cardboard cutout sprite type stuff with the 2d plane sprites.
[17031.00s -> 17041.85s]  I actually am not a big fan of that. And I don't not, I don't hate it or anything, but just,
[17041.85s -> 17051.42s]  I like how this game doesn't do that. It's 3d. There's no sprites like the 2d sprites. What are
[17051.42s -> 17057.90s]  you a Gen Xer? No. The rat level is hidden in episode three map four. That's good to know.
[17059.16s -> 17074.76s]  All right. Level select episode three map four. How do I pick the level? Do I,
[17074.76s -> 17093.93s]  do I, can I not pick a low? Right. Okay. Episode three map four. So this is one, two, three,
[17094.65s -> 17109.82s]  four. Not with this current loadout. I want just, just give me everything. So where is it?
[17110.54s -> 17143.37s]  Is it hard to find? It's right there. Where are my guns? I didn't select them. How the hell did I do
[17143.37s -> 17161.86s]  that? All right. Hold on. I need my, I need my guns. Oh, you actually have to activate them.
[17162.84s -> 17198.02s]  I see. Okay. So where's it at? Just play until I can find it. Kind of. It's over there. It's over
[17198.02s -> 17220.94s]  there. Why am I still crouching? There's the key. Yeah. Yellow key. Find the toilet. It's red.
[17220.94s -> 17228.42s]  You go fast here, but it's probably a bad idea. I can't see.
[17229.30s -> 17246.07s]  Close the door. Basement door is down here. I got all the guns in the game. Why am I?
[17247.27s -> 17269.18s]  Now we go down. Wait. Get the chest of trust. Just for fun. All right. Down here.
[17269.82s -> 17277.66s]  Pick up this thing. Sure thing. Go around this way. Right. And we go this way. And then we,
[17277.90s -> 17288.26s]  all right. Through here. Quickly. Here we are. I made it. There's two guys down this hallway. I
[17288.26s -> 17299.05s]  remember. I remember them coming down here. I remember you. There's another one. Actually,
[17299.05s -> 17304.25s]  I think, no, it's a, it's a Wendigo. Right. From what I remember. Wasn't it a Wendigo?
[17319.27s -> 17346.68s]  Going too fast, but I have to. Oh, please. He's dying to frog wheel. Yeah, whatever. Okay.
[17347.48s -> 17351.48s]  Okay. I remember this part. Sort of. Kind of.
[17359.50s -> 17365.70s]  Right. All right. You know, I'm looking for a toilet, you said. Wendigo is in this one.
[17368.15s -> 17387.18s]  Okay. Was I not supposed to kill that? Okay. Where's my flashlight?
[17388.90s -> 17393.86s]  I still haven't gotten my flashlight. I think I should have by now, right?
[17394.50s -> 17419.51s]  Because I just ran through a ton, a ton of shit. Okay. There we go. We're good about this guy.
[17420.31s -> 17425.38s]  There's nothing in here, right? Okay. Now the next part.
[17427.14s -> 17435.54s]  Because this is the blue door. Was there another way to go?
[17439.54s -> 17446.52s]  No. Yeah. This way. This flashlight. This blue key. Okay. Let's move.
[17446.52s -> 17490.44s]  Okay. I think I'm close, right? It's before the toy. Don't copy pasta that. That was bad info.
[17494.58s -> 17508.10s]  Don't copy pasta. Don't. Bad info. Let's get my crossbow ready. Activate this.
[17508.10s -> 17550.07s]  You. And you. How are you doing? Good. Good. Forget about this part.
[17551.43s -> 17557.02s]  Dog. Don't think he can't make it out. He can.
[17570.07s -> 17613.35s]  That shoots room. Okay. Somebody else. Where are you? Silence. All right. Red key.
[17614.07s -> 17623.05s]  I've got the red key. I need to go back. So do I activate this? When you go through
[17623.05s -> 17626.09s]  the yellow door, turn left and look behind the junk for a secret switch.
[17626.73s -> 17643.69s]  Our club is open. Brings us back to here. It's pretty rad. I don't use that term very often.
[17652.98s -> 17662.46s]  So I'm done in here. To get back there. Go back all the way down to where I was before
[17662.54s -> 17687.67s]  that red door. How far back was it? It was all the way up here, wasn't it? Chaos crawls to me.
[17688.87s -> 17719.88s]  Right. Okay. What does it now? Look. Is it back down here? Is it? I can't get back up here through
[17719.88s -> 17747.78s]  here. He found the strawberry room. Did I miss it back up here? All right. Now it's just the
[17747.78s -> 17760.30s]  red door back here. All right. There's the yellow door. What is the red door?
[17781.22s -> 17788.42s]  Damn, that's far. That's all the way back here. All right. Wait. Didn't I already do this? I
[17788.42s -> 17814.22s]  already did this. No, this is wrong. So wait. There are multiple red doors. Oh, shit.
[17822.33s -> 17831.10s]  Left after yellow door. Isn't that the one that I just opened? So left after yellow door.
[17832.95s -> 17841.82s]  Is you talking about like go here like through here? Should I just open a wiki behind the junk?
[17844.73s -> 17868.28s]  Okay. Now nowhere. He's actually blind. What are you talking about?
[17872.78s -> 17880.62s]  Okay. So if this changed, this was the I knew I had my in my brain. This was a different.
[17881.58s -> 17888.47s]  I'm not taking this. So like this was why I pressed a button and all of a sudden the whole
[17888.47s -> 17938.97s]  world changes. I didn't think this was anything important. Flush your sins away. I thought that
[17938.97s -> 17950.68s]  was the secret. This is this. This is this is not bullshit. This is a real place. I thought. Wow.
[17950.68s -> 17958.01s]  Okay. I stand completely corrected here. This is a whole new level. All right. I thought you guys
[17958.01s -> 17961.86s]  just taking the piss. I thought that was like a secret way to leave that level. All right.
[17962.02s -> 17991.75s]  Whatever. Let's go. All right. All right. It's time just to smoke them out.
[18012.82s -> 18026.01s]  Yellow key. That was a direct hit. Leave all this stuff. Red key is the cat police.
[18027.21s -> 18068.25s]  All right. A couple ways to go. Let's try this way first. Hey, you little bastard. Fuck. They're
[18068.25s -> 18086.66s]  going to bite your toes off. I hope not. All right. Red secret inside of the secret. Interesting.
[18087.46s -> 18120.07s]  All right. Got a red key. This is another secret. Hey, it is. And shotguns. Put on the rat song.
[18134.74s -> 18146.71s]  All right. Germa the rat song for one hour.
[18156.87s -> 18169.77s]  This is going to start fucking with me. Wait.
[18173.29s -> 18184.49s]  I can't take this. I can't take. I can only take this for like 30 seconds. Ecomaniac.
[18190.17s -> 18204.89s]  No, I can't do this for more than a few minutes. I'm killing them. That's not something.
[18213.43s -> 18220.22s]  Put on the birthday remix. What happened to the song? Oh.
[18223.74s -> 18225.82s]  It's infiltrating my brain.
[18242.62s -> 18243.34s]  Yellow key.
[18251.90s -> 18255.82s]  Oh, man. It's like a maze. All right. I need yellow key. Yellow.
[18258.89s -> 18266.07s]  All right. Birthday remix. I can't hear this anymore. That's I just clicked on the wrong one.
[18273.61s -> 18275.21s]  It's staying. It's staying.
[18286.30s -> 18288.22s]  This song is so fucking stupid.
[18293.02s -> 18298.06s]  I need a blue key. No. Fuck this song. I don't want to listen to this one either.
[18301.24s -> 18321.38s]  How about a rat's birthday mixtape? This has 679,000 views. I didn't upload this.
[18322.26s -> 18334.46s]  This is a video. There's a lot of views. All right. I need to get a yellow key.
[18349.18s -> 18364.12s]  I'm lost. I know that's what the blue door is, but where do I get the blue key? I'm so lost.
[18365.48s -> 18387.03s]  There it is. Turn it up.
[18466.30s -> 18475.54s]  Is it not done? That was actually a giant rat.
[18477.35s -> 18480.55s]  Blast yourself back down. Did I just, didn't I try that? I was standing on it.
[18485.86s -> 18496.39s]  Hooray. That was cool. What does this put you out? Just you skip to the next level.
[18498.30s -> 18502.97s]  This puts you on blasphemy. That was fun. All right. Let me actually,
[18504.14s -> 18508.14s]  I'm glad you guys told me to do that. All right. Endless mode. The farm.
[18509.02s -> 18520.82s]  I want to try it. This is a series of waves.
[18527.64s -> 18534.66s]  Damage numbers or something. Has there been damage numbers this whole game?
[18546.55s -> 18557.30s]  Oh, I probably shouldn't have done that. All right. Wave two. Where are you? Oh, behind me.
[18558.26s -> 18566.86s]  Give me. Oh, wait. Shotgun. Yeah. Give me the shotgun.
[18567.26s -> 18583.11s]  All right. Is there any health? Or do I just have to survive? Oh my God. He was, he, he's up there.
[18584.07s -> 18594.31s]  He just spawned on top of me. Why does he get to wave three? I can do better than that.
[18594.87s -> 18614.33s]  Is this shooting faster or am I insane? Taking damage on wave one? Laugh out loud.
[18615.53s -> 18631.42s]  I just want to make sure I get everything. All the, all the levels, you know?
[18632.46s -> 18643.94s]  So what's a respectable thing to get to? What's a respectable wave? Three?
[18645.22s -> 18685.08s]  Twenty? Twenty? Are you kidding me? Re-chat. Re-chat. Once you hit 20, you're in the big leagues.
[18699.66s -> 18718.78s]  All right. Using rifle on that kind of enemies. Seriously. Discussion. Go home. Go home.
[18718.78s -> 18732.02s]  Go home. Turn off your streaming. Go home. We're just running around in a circle.
[18732.02s -> 18749.54s]  Really just hit me. We're just running around. Just stop running. Just turn. What? You fucking
[18749.54s -> 18794.06s]  asshole. Jesus. Holy. No. He was. Oh, I can do it. No. God. What is this? Did he wrap around
[18794.06s -> 18815.66s]  behind me? He just gave me one hit. Stupid. Give me all my shit. Give me all my shit. Give me all
[18815.66s -> 18885.21s]  my shit. Give me my shit. What's shooting me? You must learn everything. Collect. Collect.
[18911.43s -> 18935.54s]  Stop. Put on the rat song. I'm concentrating. I'm concentrating. I can't do that.
[18948.02s -> 18993.56s]  No way. No way. No way. There's no way. No way. Dude, you left your stream on. I'm playing.
[18994.12s -> 19002.38s]  This is a, this game's dangerous. This is not a drill. German 95 is playing the ratacombs
[19003.34s -> 19005.98s]  and it has the song on in the background.
[19010.68s -> 19020.04s]  This game's dangerous because I, I just, I know I have what it takes to get to like 10 or 20.
[19020.98s -> 19029.77s]  But I've been playing, I played it a lot today. I might be blending together. I know I can do it
[19029.77s -> 19035.13s]  and that's, that's what, that's the problem. Is me thinking I can get to like level 10
[19035.77s -> 19055.85s]  will keep me here for five hours straight. I'm going to slow down. What's with the speed? You
[19055.85s -> 19061.62s]  don't have to go that fast. You really don't. In fact, it's probably better off if you don't.
[19062.50s -> 19095.02s]  Okay. Let's just keep it going. Okay. That's good. I have to at least get to like seven or eight.
[19095.02s -> 19103.66s]  I have to. Now I'm going to get to level seven. How would I ever call my mother later and say I,
[19104.30s -> 19106.70s]  you know, then talk to her on our weekly Sunday discussions.
[19107.58s -> 19143.40s]  Easy. Careful. Careful. Don't get that. Does that, hold on. Does that respond every time?
[19145.54s -> 19152.04s]  I want to spam. I can't, I can't look away. I get to spam it. Whatever the answer is.
[19159.06s -> 19178.86s]  Fuck you. Jesus. Maybe. You can't say maybe. Guys on top have to go first
[19179.50s -> 19190.86s]  unless you're literally right in front of me. Oh, somebody. I don't know who it was.
[19215.22s -> 19219.77s]  Oh, is there another chainsaw guy? There is, isn't there? I know there's a chainsaw guy hanging out.
[19220.57s -> 19236.97s]  He forgot he was streaming again. That's okay. Holy fucking my face.
[19238.01s -> 19277.70s]  Chainsaw guy. Where is he? I know he exists. What? Who? Dick. Oh, what the fuck? There was
[19277.70s -> 19287.40s]  a chainsaw guy behind me the whole time. He missed somehow. He missed. I don't know how he
[19287.40s -> 19293.48s]  missed. All right. I got to seven. I can stop. I'm done. Game's fun. Okay. That's instantly done.
[19294.20s -> 19310.23s]  All right. I'm happy with it. I got to seven. That's all I care about.
[19311.19s -> 19322.02s]  Fuck. That's a lot of guys with the shotguns. Can't reach 10. I'm okay with that. It's tough.
[19324.22s -> 19333.06s]  It's tricky. It is, guys. It's tricky. Play a different map, you donut. I'm a man.
[19333.94s -> 19383.50s]  I call that bullshit. He thinks he's screaming again. All right. If I don't get to seven,
[19384.14s -> 19398.12s]  who cares? But I'm going to do a different map. Oh my lord. I didn't even know he existed.
[19399.08s -> 19416.41s]  Didn't even know. These guys are so fast. Like they're so fast. My eyes are itching. What do I do?
[19416.41s -> 19467.24s]  Call the eye doctor. Did I actually get hit by that? Somebody's still running around. It's this
[19467.24s -> 19497.67s]  guy. Is the dog still there? I hope not. Where's the dog? All right. Wave six. We're skipping this
[19497.67s -> 19542.68s]  one. Die. Oh, will he die? Okay. I'm seven. The problem was I had the shotgun equipped and it's
[19542.68s -> 19562.58s]  just not fast enough when you have like 10 people running into the room. That's going to fuck with
[19562.58s -> 19587.94s]  me. Give me all the guns. I know there's somebody behind me. I know there is. I know.
[19589.54s -> 19608.26s]  Oh, excuse me. Okay. What's with that spawn?
[19611.30s -> 19639.56s]  Did you just juke me? This is hard. This is tricky. This is where
[19641.88s -> 19650.71s]  what especially the spawns. You just don't know where to go. You just got to keep moving. But if
[19650.71s -> 19654.55s]  you move, what if there's a guy, what if a crazy doctor spawns on top of you? Just stabs you.
[19654.55s -> 19673.56s]  Give me all the stuff. I have no health. This is a wash.
[19677.37s -> 19680.20s]  Is there anything down there?
[19693.35s -> 19708.94s]  Two shots with the crazy doctors. Didn't want to pick that up. God damn it.
[19721.46s -> 19743.16s]  Hey. Oh, my health is so low. Where are those onions? Where are those onions?
[19745.34s -> 19767.72s]  Where are the onions? What? What just happened? What if it hit me? All right,
[19767.72s -> 19782.73s]  let's go through the cathedral. I'm burning up. I'm burning out here. I probably should
[19782.73s -> 19808.12s]  have picked that up after. I don't want to be stuck out. I got to get items. Whoa. That's
[19810.12s -> 19850.22s]  this is going to be scary. Guns. Need them. Don't use these yet. Back of my head is itching.
[19850.22s -> 19858.10s]  Why is my head so itchy? What's wrong with my body? I'll take the sword. That's actually pretty good.
[19859.06s -> 19947.08s]  Dogs got in. Who's left? Day. The tornado's here. The tornado is here. I did it. Is there
[19947.08s -> 19973.90s]  another tornado? Another tornado. Damn it. God damn it. I'm out of cool shit. I'm out of good shit.
[19983.27s -> 19989.45s]  Whoa. Oh, my God. That just threw me off so bad. Where did you even come from?
[19990.66s -> 20005.72s]  What? Oh, all right. It's my last attempt. This one. This one's too long.
[20014.52s -> 20023.54s]  There was one mistake and it's over. You make a single mistake. No, no human error allowed.
[20023.54s -> 20061.78s]  Don't you dare. I got dead. All right. Last attempt. That's it. And I'm done. All right. Wait,
[20061.78s -> 20087.50s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me some weapons. Give me some shit. I got to get items. Okay. Now
[20087.50s -> 20092.95s]  I'm going to do two rounds inside the cathedral with the riveter. This should be good enough.
[20093.75s -> 20130.74s]  Okay. We're good. Stay in here. That's why the tornado comes. So you can't pull this shit.
[20131.38s -> 20160.82s]  There's a lot of health out there. All right. It's time to move out. Here comes the tornado.
[20193.46s -> 20199.78s]  Oh, I'm in trouble now. I'm dead. See you later. I wasn't getting up. Yeah. I'm not getting away
[20199.78s -> 20215.26s]  from that one. I couldn't go left because there was the, uh, I was fucked. Damn. I threw it. Well,
[20215.26s -> 20258.31s]  I mean, I just, I couldn't get around it fast enough. Okay. This is actually it. No matter what.
[20258.87s -> 20276.95s]  I need to get the other weapons. I'm thinking. All right. Get some weapons. Why? Hold on. Why
[20276.95s -> 20294.98s]  would you just do that? Why are you? I hit right. I, what grenades do I? No, I'm in trouble.
[20302.70s -> 20350.38s]  Machine gun fire. You gotta be standing right there. Dick. Dude. He's going wacky. All right.
[20350.38s -> 20360.17s]  I got to try to get to past seven. Although I'm running on empty. It's all right. No excuses. Let's
[20360.25s -> 20370.15s]  go. That was bad. That was very, very bad. That was the worst thing that could have possibly
[20370.15s -> 20376.98s]  happened. I thought he was already on the other side. I'm dead. Yeah. Oh yeah. This is over.
[20389.69s -> 20405.30s]  Where'd the dog go? Oh man. It's so, it's so intense. I'm so addicted to it, but it's
[20405.30s -> 20426.49s]  so intense. Again. No, no. I, I'm at, I think I'm at a wall right now. Maybe if I started with this,
[20426.89s -> 20434.65s]  look, I blew every ounce of my video gamer essence on that gauntlet level where I had to
[20434.65s -> 20457.83s]  fight like 5,000 people. My gaming spirit is depleted. His gaming meter is low. Boost is morale.
[20460.22s -> 20474.30s]  So here's the deal. I'm going to do it one more time. I'm going to be quiet this time.
[20474.30s -> 20600.39s]  Fuck, fuck, fuck. It's like holding my breath. Oh, fuck, fuck. I still got it. Did I just,
[20600.39s -> 20639.30s]  holy shit, calm down. God damn it. You fucking assholes. God, this spread and the damages.
[20639.30s -> 20675.46s]  God, this sucks. Well, I'm dead. Oh, okay. I need help. That's not good enough.
[20676.18s -> 20688.49s]  How am I ever going to kill these guys when there's 10 of them that spawn on top of the roofs?
[20689.45s -> 20710.10s]  Let's get away from the spawns, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Give me the, uh, there's a rifle ammo.
[20711.67s -> 20724.09s]  No, I didn't want you to die. I didn't want you to die. Oh, it's, oh, it's so hard.
[20727.40s -> 20740.95s]  God damn it. Oh, it's so hard. They're all up on their rafters. You got to like almost
[20740.95s -> 20753.40s]  hide it. You can't hide it here though. No, that's it. That's it. I'm just, I'm okay. I'm
[20753.40s -> 20757.16s]  going to say my goodbyes to you while I do this and I'm not paying attention so maybe I'll do better.
[20760.23s -> 20769.19s]  So next week, I'm going to be gone for a couple days. I'll see you guys on, uh, what's today?
[20769.19s -> 20783.37s]  What is today? What's today? Saturday? Sunday? Saturday. I'll see you guys on Tuesday and what
[20783.37s -> 20787.29s]  we're going to do is we're going to start the Outer Worlds. I'm going to just play. I've been
[20787.29s -> 20794.04s]  putting it off and putting it off and putting it off for a month. I've actually been putting it
[20794.04s -> 20813.66s]  off for a month. So that's what we're going to do. I have no idea how anything about the game. I
[20813.66s -> 20825.98s]  just know that it's the new Vegas guys. Is there a new video game? I can't believe you didn't die.
[20828.26s -> 20848.76s]  There's the guy with the gun here. He's right there. There he is.
[20848.76s -> 20914.38s]  There's his punk. All right, slow down. Give me this shit. Pick it all up. And look, here's
[20914.38s -> 20919.96s]  the thing. If Outer Worlds, if I don't like Outer Worlds, then I just won't play it.
[20922.04s -> 20962.33s]  It's that simple. You either like it or you don't. Okay, I have an opportunity here.
[20963.05s -> 21028.66s]  Okay, the strategy is shotgun. Whoa! There's somebody else. All right, I did it. I actually,
[21028.66s -> 21034.58s]  I finally did it. I can go to bed now. I can go to bed. I've done. I've done. I did my thing.
[21034.58s -> 21038.50s]  I'm going to cash out here. All right, this is who wants to be a millionaire. I got to the
[21039.22s -> 21042.34s]  $40,000 question. I just got it and I'm done. I'll take the money, please.
[21080.73s -> 21094.20s]  All right, I'm going to pick up the S. Not yet, though. I need ammo. Okay, good.
[21094.92s -> 21101.11s]  Let me just ammo. Five community subs. Thanks for the five community subs.
[21103.88s -> 21143.53s]  Near shoe. Thank you for that. What level is it? Oh, I, what did I? All right, that's it.
[21144.09s -> 21153.19s]  I had to do that. Getting to level 20 is where it really begins. Holy shit. I can't imagine
[21153.19s -> 21163.74s]  how hard that is. If you get past level 10, 12, 15. Oh, actually perfect time to stop. We're just
[21163.74s -> 21173.66s]  at about exactly almost six hours. Exactly what I thought it was going to be. So I will see you
[21173.66s -> 21183.94s]  guys again on Tuesday. We're going to do the outer world. Get to level 10. Oh, I can't. I'm
[21183.94s -> 21191.30s]  burnt up. I have to ash my body that is a cigarette right now. Like there's just,
[21191.30s -> 21197.62s]  you haven't ashed it. There's just dead cigarette for the entire length of the cigarette. You have
[21197.62s -> 21209.14s]  to ash it. I'm just dead. I'm a burnt out cigarette right now. That was a weird analogy. Can you tell
[21209.14s -> 21214.86s]  that I'm burnt up? What did I just say? I have a cigarette ash when you drag it all the way and
[21214.86s -> 21224.81s]  you add it, but I haven't been ashed. Uh, dusk was amazing. That was a really, really good game,
[21228.89s -> 21238.58s]  but I'm, uh, I'm spent. I'll see you guys in a couple of days for the outer worlds. If you
[21238.58s -> 21248.02s]  don't have dusk, see if you can beat my score. Level nine on endless mode of the farm. Put in
[21248.02s -> 21258.94s]  the comments if you got there and what is your favorite weapon? Please make, please give me
[21258.94s -> 21269.53s]  engagements. So there's like 30,000 comments in my comment section. What's your favorite ice cream?
[21270.09s -> 21284.34s]  Guaranteed to get like at least 15,000 comments, but I am out of here. I'll see you guys in a few
[21284.34s -> 21291.45s]  days. Thanks for watching. As always, it was a blast. That game is fucking great. Highly recommend
[21295.67s -> 21300.31s]  this. There's a lot of content too. That took a long time. That was six hours today.
[21301.35s -> 21311.54s]  What? Five and a half, four and a half hours yesterday. That's like a 10 hour game. I did not
[21311.54s -> 21330.98s]  expect it to be that long. Let's see what we got here. That's kind of loud. Yeah, I never,
[21330.98s -> 21336.10s]  I didn't try the challenge super impossible hard difficulty. I feel like I just wouldn't want to do
[21336.10s -> 21345.00s]  it. I would take, you take one damage and you just die. I feel like that would be angry at that game.
[21345.64s -> 21354.65s]  If you 100% every level, it's like 15 hours. That's a lot. I spent more time in dusk than I did
[21355.45s -> 21368.44s]  a lot of first AAA first party games that come out 12 hours. But yeah, uh, let's do the bits.
[21368.44s -> 21375.11s]  I'll see you guys in a few days. Thanks for watching. As always, let's get to it. Who's the
[21375.11s -> 21382.60s]  Oh, at the top bits. Let's see. Oh, look at that. Oh, look at that. Wait, is this real? It changed.
[21383.16s -> 21404.95s]  Is this for real? I don't think it was this from like three days ago. How could this be so incorrect?
[21405.67s -> 21415.61s]  I don't understand. I don't think that's right. But thank you to all of you. Anyways, let's go back to
[21415.61s -> 21421.83s]  a six hours ago. We had cream corn, thanks to 250. Hey, Germany, do you think we're going to get
[21421.83s -> 21426.55s]  another German awards on New Year's Eve? It was my favorite stream last year. Reminiscing with Chad
[21426.55s -> 21431.99s]  on the highlights of 2018 was a great way to close out the year. It'd be fun to do the same for 2019.
[21431.99s -> 21450.44s]  Yes, there's going to be another stream awards. Why not? It was fun. It's fun to look back on what
[21450.44s -> 21462.15s]  people nominate and what actually wins some of this stuff. Worst noise. I have in my mind what
[21462.15s -> 21473.75s]  the worst noise is. It's definitely going to win. There's no way it doesn't win. I can't even tell
[21473.75s -> 21483.26s]  you what it is. I don't want to influence any voting. But if this is selectable, there's 100%
[21483.26s -> 21496.50s]  no way that this loses to anything. It's making me laugh. Worst joke of the year taking vote. Yeah,
[21496.50s -> 21506.50s]  let's come up to the same categories. It should be a good time. Anyways, yes, it's in the plans.
[21507.06s -> 21513.24s]  But thank you for the 250. Thank you the plushie for the 500 bits. What's your opinion on pulp and
[21513.24s -> 21526.60s]  orange juice? Do not like. I don't want to do not like pulp in my orange juice.
[21527.72s -> 21531.48s]  I also don't like pulp and lemonade. I know that's some people say I like pulp and lemonade,
[21531.48s -> 21542.22s]  but not an orange juice. I disagree. Can you believe that they still sell heavy pulp?
[21544.15s -> 21557.54s]  That shit was so gross. You can buy lots of pulp. That stuff just sits up on the shelf.
[21560.62s -> 21567.24s]  Nobody buys that. No, you don't order orange juice like you order your peanut butter.
[21567.80s -> 21576.86s]  But that's just my opinion. It's actually kind of hard to find because nobody buys it.
[21582.33s -> 21592.79s]  I hate orange juice in my pulp. Well, that's weird. Jerma, you are a weak bitch.
[21593.51s -> 21606.20s]  Somebody time that person out, please. Just like 15 seconds is all I'm looking for for that one.
[21606.20s -> 21610.20s]  10 to 15 seconds so they can sit there and really think about what they just said to me.
[21613.24s -> 21622.26s]  No, because I agree. Hey, you're supposed to go to defy the king.
[21624.23s -> 21632.90s]  It ain't the king stream. It's not fucked the king yet. Not yet. No, I don't like pulp and
[21632.90s -> 21637.88s]  orange juice. Thank you, future gamer for the 250. What do you plan to do with Jerma985 and
[21637.88s -> 21645.03s]  second Jerma with the new Copa stuff? You could get fined like $40,000 per video if they decide
[21645.03s -> 21651.83s]  that you do not properly label your video as for kids. What? None of my videos are for kids.
[21652.47s -> 21657.85s]  I feel like even TF2 videos could be interpreted as for kids just off the thumbnail of a colorful
[21657.85s -> 21668.81s]  character. I'm not going to get fined $400,000. It might be a good idea just to label all of them
[21668.81s -> 21688.17s]  as for kids as a precaution. I mean, not for kids. Here's why that is not going to ever happen.
[21689.26s -> 21696.50s]  Because what about the guy that uploaded a video nine years ago and he doesn't even know the
[21696.50s -> 21702.01s]  password to his account anymore and it's not for kids and he doesn't even remember making the video
[21702.65s -> 21720.79s]  and they're gonna find that guy $40,000. Fuck him. He goes to jail. No, YouTube is just,
[21720.79s -> 21729.91s]  YouTube is a mess. You want to make a billion dollars? Anybody in here want to make like
[21729.91s -> 21742.10s]  $500 million? Raise your hand. Would you like to? I can tell you how. Just make a YouTube competitor
[21743.06s -> 21753.37s]  that is only for children. Only. Not YouTube kids. No, no. Just like a children's learning
[21753.37s -> 21759.30s]  center that's just all videos and you can just make educational videos for kids
[21759.86s -> 21771.45s]  video streaming site. If they're so concerned about this, why don't they have YouTube kids
[21771.45s -> 21780.55s]  be a separate uploader? If that's such a huge concern, separate the uploading. Make it so you
[21780.55s -> 21787.34s]  have to upload a video to YouTube kids. Why should I? Why would I upload videos just to
[21787.34s -> 21798.79s]  YouTube and like, Oh, whatever. I don't know. Who knows? But I think I saw somebody talking
[21798.79s -> 21803.14s]  about this the other day. And by the other day, I mean, it could have been anywhere within the
[21803.14s -> 21809.93s]  last three months that if you want to go through all of the videos you've ever made and make changes
[21809.93s -> 21817.66s]  to them, you're talking about dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of hours straight
[21818.62s -> 21832.87s]  just to check a box. It would take forever. It would probably take you like 30 to 40, 50 plus
[21832.87s -> 21845.06s]  hours just to check those boxes across. Like if you had thousands of videos, they just want you
[21845.06s -> 21853.82s]  to label your videos for not for kids. I, yeah, guess what? Smoking is not for kids either.
[21853.82s -> 21873.16s]  Somehow they end up doing it. What? How do you, how do I stop that? Endorsing, not about endorsing
[21873.16s -> 21877.88s]  child smoking. I'm just saying like, how do I prevent someone from not clicking on a video?
[21878.60s -> 21896.50s]  You know, kids aren't supposed to swear, but they do. If I upload a video to YouTube, I mean,
[21896.50s -> 21903.99s]  oh yeah, I guess this video is not for kids. Go to your favorite porn website right now.
[21903.99s -> 21913.64s]  Is there a thing that says, excuse me, you're not allowed to be here? Yeah, click. What? That's all,
[21913.64s -> 21927.75s]  that's the only thing that exists there. So what you're saying is we should blame the children.
[21927.75s -> 21935.02s]  No, no, I'm just saying like, I don't, I don't know who's could or couldn't be watching my videos.
[21935.82s -> 21940.94s]  If I'm going to get like fined in quotes or whatever for somebody watching a video of mine
[21940.94s -> 21948.39s]  from like seven years ago, I don't have any control over that. Should I just label my whole
[21948.39s -> 21968.57s]  channel like not for kids? I guess I could just do that. I don't want you to, yeah, I just don't
[21968.57s -> 21988.30s]  want to get fined. I have to look into this because that just seems strange. What about when, okay,
[21988.30s -> 21997.26s]  so what about when HBO shows a rerun of the Sopranos on your cable network and your kids
[21997.34s -> 22011.99s]  in the room and you don't know that they're watching it? Do we fine HBO? HBO? How, what the
[22011.99s -> 22034.78s]  fuck? It's all about the data collection. It's about advertising to kids, not kids seeing bad
[22034.78s -> 22042.09s]  stuff. See, I think they just fucked it up from the very beginning instead of just separating it
[22042.09s -> 22048.17s]  out completely from the very beginning because now you retroactively have billions of videos
[22048.17s -> 22065.93s]  that are not suitable for anybody that just exist. It's about kids, it's about kids seeing
[22065.93s -> 22084.25s]  completely shitty content. Oh, you're fucked, dude. But regardless, I don't know, I don't think
[22084.25s -> 22091.51s]  I'm going to get in any trouble for it. I'm going to have to like talk to Mac and go check on the
[22091.51s -> 22095.27s]  channel or something and see what I would have to do. I don't know what I would even have to do.
[22104.33s -> 22116.20s]  Watch VA ends up with like a hundred thousand dollar fine. I don't know, we'll find out. We'll
[22116.20s -> 22135.06s]  see. I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue. We'll see though. But let's move on.
[22136.60s -> 22145.94s]  Interesting thought, interesting conversation though. Thank you, future gamer. Appreciate it.
[22147.70s -> 22156.41s]  Propnator, thanks for the 1500 bits. I hope this is enough for a hangry pizza. I love pizza.
[22157.21s -> 22166.97s]  It definitely is enough. I will absolutely use that for a pizza. Thank you so much for the 1500
[22166.97s -> 22173.59s]  bits. Appreciate that. Emmanuel Depressed, thanks for the 300 bits. I originally thought you had
[22173.59s -> 22178.71s]  peaked with Shpee, but after long consideration, I've decided you have now peaked with Omega Pig.
[22189.64s -> 22200.89s]  Omega Pig. True? What do you mean, true? Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the 250. First,
[22200.89s -> 22206.65s]  this is a pretty interesting game. Second, I just had to spend like 60 or 70 dollars on the binding
[22206.65s -> 22213.85s]  of Isaac. Rebirth and afterbirth, because PSN sucks ass. Do you have any recommendations aside from
[22213.85s -> 22224.73s]  like never buying stuff from the PSN? You're covering a lot of bases on that one, so
[22225.29s -> 22239.50s]  that's all the advice I have. Why is it that much? 70 dollars? Is it really 70 bucks for everything
[22239.50s -> 22252.70s]  on PSN? It seems like a lot. They don't have a complete edition. Probably not from the US. Oh,
[22252.70s -> 22271.13s]  right, right. They probably had to buy it like three times. That's not good. Well, I'm sorry
[22271.13s -> 22277.88s]  to hear that, but thanks for the 255. Appreciate it. It's a great game. If this is the first time
[22277.88s -> 22285.85s]  you buy it, because that's a decade worth of content. That game is so much fun. Enjoy it.
[22286.57s -> 22290.09s]  Hole of one zombie, thanks for the 300 bits. Have you ever thought about playing System Shock 2?
[22290.73s -> 22294.09s]  I don't know how to put it other than your streams are hilarious. I think it'd be awesome
[22294.09s -> 22301.27s]  to see it get the German 985 treatment. German one guy. I've heard that's a very good game.
[22301.83s -> 22315.93s]  Put it on the list. Thanks for the 300 bits. Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the 250. German Isaac felt
[22315.93s -> 22321.93s]  bad for me, and on my second Judas run, I got super mush chocolate milk and then fucking brim
[22321.93s -> 22327.61s]  in the first two floors. On the third floor, I got Tammy set, so I basically... Wait, hold on.
[22327.61s -> 22334.70s]  What's going on? Isaac? This is two different people with two different Isaac stories.
[22335.26s -> 22349.70s]  You guys should talk to each other. No, it's not. The same person. This is the same person.
[22350.26s -> 22360.15s]  Why is it listed as a different person here? It's the same person. Why are you a different
[22360.15s -> 22369.05s]  person on my list here? What? Hold on. It's, yeah, twice right here. Okay, I had to refresh.
[22374.98s -> 22381.74s]  That was quick. For a second, I was like, holy shit, you guys are like, you guys should talk
[22381.74s -> 22391.51s]  to each other. Anyways, every single boss and floor, including Satan, it was beautiful.
[22394.22s -> 22397.82s]  You just bought the game and you did that? Well, you've ruined the whole game for the
[22397.82s -> 22405.69s]  rest of the time. You can never play Binding of Isaac ever again now. It'll never feel the same.
[22405.69s -> 22416.34s]  You have to do that again. You're gonna get to Satan with like the magician tears,
[22416.34s -> 22425.21s]  and you're gonna be really mad about it. There are plenty of broken builds. I know,
[22425.21s -> 22435.24s]  I'm just fucking around. Give it the German 985 treatment. What? What are you talking about?
[22438.81s -> 22443.69s]  Thank you. That's really cool to hear. If that's the first time you really played it.
[22459.05s -> 22463.05s]  I will sit up there. That sounds, thank you. I have my first job interview tomorrow and I'll
[22463.05s -> 22469.42s]  give you more money through a sub if I get the job. Hope you get it. Not for my sake at all,
[22469.42s -> 22477.58s]  but for yours. I'm happy to be your favorite content creator. Thank you.
[22478.30s -> 22486.20s]  Good luck. You're gonna, you'll be fine. You're gonna get the job. Don't worry. Thank you.
[22486.20s -> 22491.80s]  Creamcorn, thanks for the 250. Germo, what's the lore behind you getting TTS to say Michael
[22491.80s -> 22499.45s]  instead of singing it yourself? I think I explained it before. It's, it's a joke about those
[22500.33s -> 22508.81s]  tapes you could buy where it just says the kid's name. It sings a birthday song and you can get a
[22508.81s -> 22515.13s]  specialized custom. Oh, look, let's say you have a kid and the kid's name is just John, right?
[22516.86s -> 22522.38s]  It was a tape you could buy that you put in and they had like a hundred of them. John, Jack,
[22522.38s -> 22530.65s]  Jerry, Jeremy. And all it did was it sang the same song and just replaced the kid's name
[22531.58s -> 22536.46s]  with whatever name of the tape that you purchased. So you felt so special when you're on your
[22536.46s -> 22543.82s]  birthday because it was, hey, Jeremy, it's your birthday. Hey, Jeremy. And it was like,
[22543.82s -> 22547.90s]  they're talking about me. They're talking, that's, they're talking about me right now.
[22547.90s -> 22557.50s]  I think they still exist. They're on YouTube now. Go type in like birthday song for David.
[22557.50s -> 22576.02s]  The same thing will happen for instance. Okay. This one I just typed in is this
[22576.02s -> 22597.35s]  exactly what I was talking about. Let's see what happens. I mean, this one's way cool,
[22597.35s -> 22600.55s]  but you get the idea. Here you go. Here you go. Here's enough.
[22625.77s -> 22631.61s]  Okay. Cool. That was good. I wonder, I wonder what happens if I click on this one.
[22631.61s -> 22664.22s]  Happy birthday, Tyler. What about this one?
[22683.43s -> 22692.63s]  Happy birthday, Justin. How about this one? They're all the same.
[22694.07s -> 22697.51s]  There's another one. Completely different YouTube channel. Completely different channel.
[22721.21s -> 22727.53s]  Now you see in the world of YouTube, you can make these and technology has gotten a lot better.
[22728.25s -> 22735.13s]  But back in the day, they just had one recording of the song and the guy would be in the studio
[22735.13s -> 22739.93s]  and just say a hundred names and they would put that one piece in there. I'm not sure why
[22739.93s -> 22744.57s]  they would do it that way. The guy didn't sing the song a thousand times. He just said a thousand
[22744.57s -> 22748.89s]  names and sang the same song once. I think these, I think the people are actually singing the whole
[22748.89s -> 22758.62s]  song every time, or it's very good editing. Uh, this is another, this is another channel, I think.
[22761.58s -> 22780.42s]  It's cheaper and faster. That's right. Happy birthday, Gladys. So there you are. That's what,
[22780.42s -> 22826.33s]  that's what it was. Let's see. Me? What? They're talking about me. And the kid would lose their
[22826.33s -> 22831.77s]  mind because they thought that it was talking to them. It's the same reason why Dora was,
[22831.77s -> 22835.77s]  oh, do you know where it is? Yeah, I do. You're talking to me through the screen. You just don't,
[22835.77s -> 22849.78s]  what, you're like fucking seven. You're six. What the hell do you know? Let's get the credits on
[22849.78s -> 22857.58s]  screen. Roll them. Hey, it's really good. Those are YouTube kids friendly, right? They don't have to
[22857.58s -> 22879.06s]  do anything, right? Thanks for subbing everybody. If you still think people are talking to you
[22879.06s -> 22885.18s]  through the screen and you're seven, you're not the brightest kid. I, I'm, I know I'm just using
[22885.18s -> 22896.49s]  like a random young kid number. Let's just say four or three. Yeah. Seven is like second grade,
[22896.49s -> 22908.49s]  isn't it? They're talking to me still. Yeah. You're probably old enough to know that that's not
[22908.49s -> 22921.08s]  really happening, but that would thank you cream corn for the two 50. There's your explanation.
[22921.08s -> 22925.99s]  That's, I think I talked about it before, but that's what it's from door cube. Thanks for the
[22925.99s -> 22932.36s]  two 50. I met an internet friend in real life today because it turns out we both go to the same
[22932.44s -> 22939.16s]  school. That's a small world. We had no idea until recently. Anyways, he's also a big fan of you.
[22943.82s -> 22951.67s]  Don't ever tell me the odds. That's really interesting. Both go to the same school and
[22951.67s -> 22958.92s]  both watch this channel. Uh, he hasn't had the chance to watch recently. If you're watching
[22958.92s -> 22967.48s]  tonight, fluke, I hope you're able to make it through final with flying colors. Hope you did.
[22976.60s -> 22979.40s]  Thanks a lot. Uh, that's, that's a really, really interesting story actually.
[22980.04s -> 22986.39s]  That's really cool to know. Thank you. Gnarly for the two 50. Glad to hear you're going to play
[22986.39s -> 22991.51s]  outer worlds. I just beat it and had fun with it. Just so you know, chat will probably pressure you
[22991.51s -> 22997.83s]  into doing a low intelligence run. Honestly, it's not that much of a detriment, so you can do it.
[22997.83s -> 23003.77s]  If you think it might be fun for a while, I don't know. I'm, I'm going to, we'll just see what
[23003.77s -> 23014.10s]  happens. Let's see what happened. Caught up at near shoe. Thanks for the five subs. Son of genova.
[23014.10s -> 23018.26s]  Thanks for the two 50. Hey, German wanted to ask you to play blood fresh supply. It's a remaster of
[23018.26s -> 23025.72s]  an old dos FPS. I actually, when I was looking at a medieval, it's another one I was looking at
[23025.72s -> 23038.57s]  and doom also the original doom, but improved. Hypo was telling me about his ways to make it
[23038.57s -> 23047.83s]  in widescreen and better. So it is not as fuel-conducing as it could be now. We were
[23047.83s -> 23056.58s]  going to talk about and see. We'll take a look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, snoozing copter. Thanks
[23056.58s -> 23061.06s]  for the two 50 German. How are you? We're friends, right? And friends borrow each other's money,
[23061.06s -> 23066.90s]  right? Can you lend me $2 and 50 cents? I could really need it. Thanks.
[23070.39s -> 23075.11s]  Well, I have no way. I have no way to send this back to you. Also, I heard you wanted to play
[23075.11s -> 23081.51s]  death stranding off stream. Did you? What's your opinion? My opinion. I'll give you the real one.
[23081.51s -> 23092.95s]  The real opinion. I am. Yeah. I'm not going to play death stranding on stream. It's too long
[23092.95s -> 23106.60s]  for me to want to play it on stream. I think it's like a 40 plus hour experience.
[23108.39s -> 23113.67s]  And I don't the gameplay looks fun. It looks cool, but I don't think I want to do that for
[23113.67s -> 23121.62s]  30 hours. I've heard it's fantastic though, but that's something I probably would do in my own
[23121.62s -> 23135.46s]  leisure time. Even if I don't know, maybe I don't even have enough time to even sit down and play
[23135.46s -> 23140.82s]  I tried to play through God of War off stream and I got to maybe 10, 12 hours in and
[23141.54s -> 23152.20s]  almost 15 hours in and I kind of stopped there. I could see playing death stranding,
[23155.53s -> 23158.89s]  pick it up once a week and play it for a couple hours and just deliver some packages and do that
[23158.89s -> 23170.47s]  for a long time until the game's done. That you won't see it on stream. I don't think so. Not at
[23170.47s -> 23182.54s]  all. But thank you, snoozing copter. Thank you. Dragon breath. Thanks for the 250. Hi, I wanted
[23182.62s -> 23189.10s]  to say that I'm surprised you never touched Noita. It's a 2D rogue light with pixel sand physics.
[23189.10s -> 23193.10s]  I feel like it's right up your alley. Sorry, I'm outside the realm of the recommended channel,
[23193.10s -> 23198.38s]  so please don't smite me. I just like the game a lot. Also, does anyone else hear birthday music
[23198.38s -> 23209.50s]  or am I going crazy? I've heard it's very good, but I don't know if I'll stream it. Not now,
[23210.14s -> 23222.79s]  maybe. There's a lot coming up here. There's a lot coming up in the next few weeks. Maybe,
[23222.79s -> 23237.29s]  maybe soon. Maybe in the new year. 5G birthday? But I appreciate it, though. Maybe you'll see
[23237.29s -> 23241.77s]  that somewhere in like early 2020. That's one of those games that's going to be forever on the
[23241.77s -> 23254.12s]  list until I get bullied into playing it. But I do want to. And finally, Spooky Spitfire.
[23257.02s -> 23263.30s]  Back again here with 250. Thank you, Spooky. Well, he transitioned to the end of the stream.
[23263.94s -> 23268.26s]  Just an FYI, I've gotten every achievement pre-afterbirth in Isaac on my computer. Oh,
[23268.26s -> 23273.21s]  okay. There we go. But it's currently broken. So I was just like, dude, what do you mean this
[23273.21s -> 23278.81s]  run is god tier? LOL. Also, I know it's old and you have already played it on stream,
[23279.53s -> 23284.57s]  but chat is nuts and forced you to quit it early. But you should beat Hollow Knight off stream.
[23284.57s -> 23301.88s]  Tell me how the path of pain treats you. Hollow Knight was good. But Hollow Knight was, that was
[23301.88s -> 23316.12s]  also kind of back when I never streamed a game more than once or twice in a row. The new one's
[23316.12s -> 23328.31s]  coming out soon, too. It was really good. Yeah, I know. It's just lost forever. Soon? Is it not
[23328.31s -> 23347.13s]  soon? Wasn't it 2020? Like early 2020? It's TBA. Oh, okay. Well, we'll see when it comes up.
[23348.57s -> 23352.57s]  But I probably will end up just because I have to play through Hollow Knight before I do the
[23352.57s -> 23357.45s]  sequel. And you can't just, wait, you're gonna watch, you're gonna watch the movie's sequel
[23357.45s -> 23366.98s]  before you see the movie's prequel? What? No, the movie's sequel before you watch the first one.
[23368.65s -> 23372.49s]  Of course, you would watch the sequel before the, well, did the prequel come up?
[23372.49s -> 23381.29s]  When did the prequel come up? If there was a visual representation of my brain right now,
[23382.01s -> 23391.83s]  it would be a single hair in a giant dark room. And on the tip of the hair is a little
[23391.91s -> 23404.17s]  flake of fire just about to go out. Just, and that's, six hours ago, it was a blaze in there.
[23404.17s -> 23413.83s]  There was a wood stacked up really high. Playing games like that just drain me. They drain my whole
[23413.83s -> 23423.19s]  fucking psyche. What are my thoughts on the Mandalorian? I think it's amazing. I think it's
[23423.19s -> 23442.23s]  some of the best Star Wars content we've gotten this decade. I think it's fantastic. Real shit?
[23442.23s -> 23444.87s]  Yeah, no, I really do. I think it was really, really good.
[23448.58s -> 23455.75s]  Spoilers? No, don't say spoilers. Let people enjoy it because it's great. But that's my time.
[23455.75s -> 23459.03s]  I'll see you guys soon. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking out dusk with me.
[23460.71s -> 23465.67s]  It was very, very good. Highly recommend. If you don't have it, go get it. It's a great game.
[23466.47s -> 23471.35s]  I will see you guys in a few days for The Outer Worlds. We'll just play through it. I will see
[23471.35s -> 23475.59s]  if I like it. If we don't like it, then we're going to play that fucking YouTuber hand simulator game.
[23476.15s -> 23488.87s]  I think I'll like it though. Good night guys. See you soon. Have a fantastic rest of your weekend.
