[0.31s -> 11.82s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with Recoil.
[11.82s -> 14.82s]  I just was spectating. I was trying to spectate a guy that knew what he was doing.
[14.82s -> 16.82s]  Looks like Artman's gonna go in. We're gonna see here.
[16.82s -> 19.82s]  Going for the double shotgun shot. Gets the shot. Gets two shots on him.
[19.82s -> 21.82s]  Right there we got Artman gonna be going in for the kill.
[21.82s -> 23.82s]  They're gonna see on the top left staircase. Gets the pistol out.
[23.82s -> 24.82s]  Is he gonna get in on time?
[24.82s -> 26.82s]  He's dancing. I'm not going with the night kills.
[26.82s -> 28.82s]  Is he gonna get in?
[28.82s -> 37.51s]  This is so unexpected.
[37.51s -> 40.51s]  So I guess now is a good time to do a player profile on Chizzy Boy.
[40.51s -> 43.51s]  I guess now it's time to do a player profile on Clidio.
[43.51s -> 46.51s]  Clidio is one of those players you just love to watch, guys.
[46.51s -> 47.51s]  He has a lot of things in his arsenal.
[47.51s -> 50.51s]  He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world.
[50.51s -> 55.51s]  And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of information on the player that I like to see it.
[55.51s -> 58.51s]  Now I'm gonna do a player profile on V2FXXX.
[58.51s -> 61.51s]  He is one of the best SMG players in the world.
[61.51s -> 67.51s]  As you can probably imagine, having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need.
[67.51s -> 69.51s]  Now we're gonna do a player profile on Cat.
[69.51s -> 71.51s]  Now we're gonna do a player profile on Chizzy Boy.
[71.51s -> 73.51s]  Chizzy Boy is another one of those characters you love to see.
[73.51s -> 77.51s]  Now we're gonna do a player profile on Zeyosio.
[77.51s -> 82.12s]  Just like that, we get a two-piece.
[82.12s -> 85.82s]  Just like...
[85.82s -> 90.15s]  Oh, yeah. Stop him. Stop him.
[90.15s -> 92.58s]  Me and my teammates.
[92.58s -> 94.58s]  Me and my teammates recoiling all over the place.
[94.58s -> 97.78s]  Look at that.
[97.78s -> 98.78s]  I'll teach you how to recoil, guys.
[98.78s -> 101.78s]  What you want to do first, you want to turn a corner with a fucking grenade in your hand.
[101.78s -> 105.09s]  And you just want to throw it into their spawn.
[105.09s -> 107.09s]  I don't even know if that's their spawn.
[107.09s -> 108.39s]  I got a couple hits.
[108.39s -> 109.70s]  Tango down.
[109.70s -> 110.70s]  Charlie down.
[110.70s -> 112.13s]  And...
[112.13s -> 114.01s]  Guy in the window.
[114.01s -> 117.81s]  Down.
[117.81s -> 119.43s]  I gotta get...
[119.43s -> 120.43s]  I gotta string something.
[120.43s -> 122.25s]  What the hell is that guy?
[122.25s -> 123.25s]  What the hell?
[123.25s -> 125.77s]  This guy got like face paint on?
[125.77s -> 127.77s]  I want to like see his broken ass neck.
[127.77s -> 129.77s]  Yeah, he's got like face paint on.
[129.77s -> 131.77s]  This guy looks like a WWF wrestler.
[131.77s -> 136.90s]  I want to be like a WCWNWO wrestler.
[136.90s -> 140.13s]  There it is.
[140.13s -> 141.13s]  Killing machine.
[141.13s -> 143.07s]  Oh!
[143.07s -> 144.07s]  That's two!
[144.07s -> 145.07s]  That...
[145.07s -> 147.25s]  Fucking WCW guy killed me.
[147.25s -> 154.35s]  The fuck happened to you?
[154.35s -> 159.47s]  I definitely want to be a WCW guy.
[159.47s -> 161.47s]  We got this WCW guy.
[161.47s -> 163.90s]  This guy is just kind of crazy looking.
[163.90s -> 164.90s]  He's kind of creepy.
[164.90s -> 165.90s]  And then we got tattoo guy.
[165.90s -> 170.34s]  Why is tattoo guy the guy with the face paint?
[170.34s -> 172.34s]  And then this should be tattoo guy.
[172.34s -> 179.01s]  Something I've noticed in every video game that has this gun.
[179.01s -> 181.82s]  The Draugnov always sucks.
[181.82s -> 188.41s]  Has there ever been a game made where the Draugnov like wasn't a fucking piece of shit?
[188.41s -> 191.61s]  Has that ever happened?
[191.61s -> 192.61s]  I just got three kills in a row.
[192.61s -> 194.61s]  So let's just pretend like I didn't say that.
[194.61s -> 200.65s]  Ooh.
[200.65s -> 202.40s]  Ooh.
[202.40s -> 204.09s]  Ooh.
[204.09s -> 207.50s]  Somebody's...
[207.50s -> 210.50s]  Somebody learned how to play.
[210.50s -> 219.18s]  It be a part of war.
[219.18s -> 222.92s]  I'm going to teach you guys how to make pancakes.
[222.92s -> 223.92s]  All right?
[223.92s -> 224.92s]  It's going to be pretty easy.
[224.92s -> 226.10s]  There's the first ingredient.
[226.10s -> 228.10s]  That's two eggs.
[228.10s -> 230.59s]  Around this corner we got some butter.
[230.59s -> 233.96s]  And then of course you cannot forget.
[233.96s -> 234.96s]  Fucking God.
[234.96s -> 237.58s]  This is the secret recipe for pancakes.
[237.58s -> 238.58s]  Two eggs.
[238.58s -> 242.04s]  Then you got to also put in the butter.
[242.04s -> 244.54s]  But I can't find the butter.
[244.54s -> 245.54s]  The butter ran down here.
[245.54s -> 246.78s]  There's the butter.
[246.78s -> 249.02s]  I missed the bowl with the butter.
[249.02s -> 250.02s]  Fucking God damn it.
[250.02s -> 252.26s]  Hey, what's going on everybody?
[252.26s -> 253.26s]  Jerma here.
[253.26s -> 254.26s]  Welcome to Cooking with Jerma.
[254.26s -> 256.26s]  This is a new series I'm doing.
[256.26s -> 259.26s]  Where I show you how to make a very healthy, very nice breakfast.
[259.26s -> 260.43s]  And what you want is you want a bowl.
[260.43s -> 262.43s]  Bowl large enough to put a bunch of stuff in obviously.
[262.43s -> 265.43s]  Because we're going to give you my secret recipe for pancakes.
[265.43s -> 269.80s]  So what you want to do is of course you want to put in, you know, what we got here.
[269.80s -> 270.80s]  Two eggs.
[270.80s -> 273.23s]  A little bit of butter.
[273.23s -> 274.23s]  The butter ran away.
[274.23s -> 275.23s]  Hold on.
[275.23s -> 277.73s]  The butter fell on the floor.
[277.73s -> 278.73s]  I got to pick up the butter.
[278.73s -> 279.73s]  There's the butter.
[279.73s -> 282.48s]  There's the butter.
[282.48s -> 283.48s]  Butter's in the bowl now.
[283.48s -> 285.48s]  Then of course you got to add the flour.
[285.48s -> 287.48s]  Flour is shooting at me.
[287.48s -> 288.78s]  Flour's shooting at me.
[288.78s -> 289.78s]  It's okay.
[289.78s -> 290.78s]  It's okay.
[290.78s -> 293.43s]  Flour killed me.
[293.43s -> 296.38s]  Welcome to Cooking with Jerma guys.
[296.38s -> 300.38s]  In this episode I'm going to teach you how to make pancakes.
[300.38s -> 302.38s]  Those of you that think you know how to make pancakes.
[302.38s -> 303.38s]  You got it all wrong.
[303.38s -> 305.38s]  You see, first you got to get a bowl.
[305.38s -> 309.18s]  Then once you get that bowl you throw in two eggs.
[309.18s -> 312.35s]  Once the eggs are in there you put in the flour.
[312.35s -> 315.66s]  Once the flour's in there you roll your sleeves up.
[315.66s -> 316.66s]  Get your hands a little bit dirty.
[316.66s -> 318.66s]  And you add a little bit more butter.
[318.66s -> 320.66s]  Fucking god damn it.
[320.66s -> 326.34s]  Do you understand how hard you're trying to make one of the worst jokes I have ever heard?
[326.34s -> 329.25s]  I'm getting behind them.
[329.25s -> 331.42s]  I'm getting in their spawn.
[331.42s -> 337.39s]  And it's going to be a big fucking surprise when I get in there.
[337.39s -> 344.01s]  Speaking of big surprise.
[344.01s -> 346.01s]  What is this?
[346.01s -> 349.01s]  What is this fucking Gumby?
[349.01s -> 350.76s]  What is this?
[350.76s -> 352.76s]  What is that like fucking?
[352.76s -> 358.22s]  Stretch Armstrong in like a fucking taffy factory.
[358.22s -> 360.22s]  And we're coming out of the wire here guys.
[360.22s -> 364.22s]  This is the final moment in the 2016 Recoil Tournament.
[364.22s -> 366.22s]  Welcome. I'm very glad to do it with you.
[366.22s -> 370.22s]  We're very glad to cast you.
[370.22s -> 372.22s]  Very glad to do it.
