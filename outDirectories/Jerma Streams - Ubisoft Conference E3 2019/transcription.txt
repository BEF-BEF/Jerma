[5.24s -> 21.21s]  Come on, we ain't doing an intro. No intro. I'm not late. I'm not late. This is the previews
[21.21s -> 26.86s]  for the movie. You can go to a movie 25 minutes late and still catch the first two minutes.
[26.86s -> 32.21s]  I haven't gone to a movie on time in fucking my whole life. Yeah, I sound a little froggy.
[32.21s -> 39.12s]  It's because I got some schnapps up there. I'll be alright though. C3, babe. Come on.
[39.12s -> 54.42s]  I'm gonna make a tweet. Hold on. Well, that is not what I said. The lights aren't
[54.42s -> 60.26s]  even turned on in here. That's how you know it's a fucking dire situation right now. We've
[60.26s -> 69.50s]  got like five, ten minutes. I need to write something. What do I write here? Day two.
[69.50s -> 78.99s]  Is it day two? It's day two, right? Why is the outro playing? Here, listen to them.
[78.99s -> 88.03s]  They're probably talking about fucking- Oh, brain froze. I'm doing two things at once.
[88.47s -> 97.79s]  Let's go. Day two. E3. Now, it looks like you've got a pretty special avatar there.
[97.79s -> 104.19s]  I'm gonna put my phone away. It's just like a movie.
[104.19s -> 111.83s]  Now, it looks like we just entered a station. Tell us a little bit
[111.83s -> 116.03s]  about what's going on here. We're on the tour regarding education. Now,
[116.59s -> 125.83s]  alright. Hey, how are you? Good to see you again. What is it historically after?
[125.83s -> 132.63s]  Is this another Assassin's Creed? I love how Assassin's Creed puts history into the game.
[132.63s -> 140.23s]  I'm trying to listen. You're not trying.
[147.03s -> 152.39s]  Quiz? Yeah, so I hope you've been paying attention. Let's go for one easy question, right?
[152.39s -> 163.71s]  I saw the Twitch tweet, by the way. They took that moment from yesterday.
[163.71s -> 175.46s]  That's like on the official Twitter now. It was not even a funny joke.
[175.46s -> 178.06s]  People probably looking at that tweet going like, oh, this is what the
[178.06s -> 188.74s]  kind of streams he has? His stream must suck. It was me covering up Keanu Reeves' head
[188.74s -> 195.46s]  and pointing. I was like an asshole. I was obnoxious. That's not me. This is me.
[195.46s -> 203.17s]  I'm a good guy. Well, thank you so much for joining us today and telling us a little bit
[203.17s -> 207.97s]  about the Discovery Tour and a huge shout out to the team at Ubisoft Quebec for creating
[207.97s -> 212.85s]  these two amazing features, the Story Builder and the Discovery Tour. Thank you again,
[213.41s -> 217.89s]  Thank you, Carrie. Also, if you're curious about the Discovery Tour, please ask your
[217.89s -> 222.21s]  questions on the Assassin's Creed subreddit and we'll answer as many as we can.
[222.21s -> 225.89s]  I got a piece kind of just migrating over this way.
[225.89s -> 230.05s]  Along with the Story Builder. It's an amazing time to jump back into the world
[230.05s -> 234.93s]  of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Now, for those of us who are just joining this live stream,
[234.93s -> 238.37s]  the conference is going to start really soon, but before we wrap it up and jump
[238.37s -> 243.01s]  into the theater, we have one more amazing WoW Moments compilation for you.
[243.01s -> 246.37s]  Now, these are the best clips that we received from you, the community.
[246.37s -> 250.21s]  So hold on to your beards, mudflaps, butts, whatever you got.
[251.33s -> 253.78s]  You're just assuming that I have like a big gamer beard?
[255.78s -> 268.54s]  All right. That was hacking. That guy hacked. That's hacking. That person was hacking.
[272.83s -> 281.26s]  Oh, no, no. These are like streamers. Oh, never mind. I thought it was an Ubisoft
[281.26s -> 291.25s]  official thing. Did I do purple for Twitch? Does that just make me look like a fucking dickhead?
[291.89s -> 300.91s]  Am I going to be the streamer voice? All right. For a second I thought my webcam was fucked up.
[301.47s -> 304.83s]  No, that's somebody else's webcam. This is my don't use webcam. I hate webcam.
[306.19s -> 315.01s]  This is next level reaction. Overreaction in E3. Not only am I reacting to your stream,
[315.01s -> 318.05s]  but I'm putting my webcam on top of your webcam.
[325.57s -> 338.72s]  Oh, I'm just going to spill my coffee. I'm not going to fix it. I'm going to leave it like that.
[340.40s -> 344.64s]  Over the next two or three hours, watch what happens to my hair. You are going to see
[345.28s -> 350.64s]  this piece of hair is going to fluff up. It's like a chia pet. It's going to go up
[350.64s -> 358.50s]  and it's going to pop. Okay. I thought it was like the little kid playing. I was like, what?
[359.30s -> 363.86s]  Dude, he started swinging while the thing was getting me up so he knew I was going to get up.
[365.06s -> 371.54s]  What if one of my clips are in here? I hope one of my clips is in here.
[373.14s -> 379.87s]  That would be perfect. That means I have to play an Ubisoft game, which I haven't done in
[379.87s -> 389.44s]  fucking three years. That was pretty good. That was pretty good. I think they had to
[389.52s -> 394.24s]  invent an ESRB rating descriptor for chicken-related acts for that asshole.
[394.24s -> 399.44s]  That was mean. I felt so bad for the chicken. I just thought it was funny. I don't know.
[399.44s -> 404.64s]  Poor chicken though. This has been such a great show. From the wow moments to all the
[404.64s -> 407.84s]  creators around here. I mean, it's just been a blast. Absolutely. Game sound's really cool.
[407.84s -> 412.08s]  That was like a super ultra broom. That was like a street sweeper broom. What the hell was
[412.08s -> 415.68s]  that? Just the energy that's been here today. I want to thank everybody who's been here on
[415.68s -> 418.72s]  site, who's watching on the street. I want one of those shirts. The star players that are
[418.72s -> 423.92s]  hanging around. It's just been an amazing day. And of course, we've got a lot more to come
[423.92s -> 428.48s]  after the conference starting at about 2 p.m. We're going to have a celebrity showdown.
[429.04s -> 434.00s]  Team T-Pain. Team Lil Yachty in Rainbow Six Siege facing off. Why did he do that?
[434.88s -> 438.40s]  Wait, what? He just hurt himself. It's going to be a good match.
[439.20s -> 441.60s]  You know, I really can't choose who I want to win. What the fuck?
[442.40s -> 451.20s]  I'm not in this. I'm not answering. I'm staying away. Team Neutral. He hit his mouth on that
[451.20s -> 458.56s]  coffee table. That guy's not even part of this. He's not here anymore. The show starts in 34
[458.56s -> 467.44s]  seconds. Back to Far Cry. Then over to Assassin's Creed again. Back around to Far
[467.44s -> 481.36s]  Cry. Second time, third time. So many good options. So many good options.
[484.40s -> 488.16s]  On behalf of all of us at the pre-show, thank you so much for joining us. We're going to head
[488.16s -> 492.48s]  into the Orpheum Theater. And for everyone at Ubisoft, we hope you enjoy. Ubisoft.
[493.44s -> 501.86s]  Uh, rated RP to M. Uh, content may not be appropriate for anybody. Here comes an orchestra.
[502.50s -> 510.70s]  The Stone Cold Glass Breaks. And they do like the Stone Cold Steve Austin theme song.
[511.42s -> 514.82s]  But this is the Assassin's Creed Symphony.
[538.56s -> 585.54s]  Do we go now or when do we go? Do we? It's dead. I'm so pissed off right now. I can
[585.54s -> 612.82s]  imagine if I got to play along. How am I gonna? I need a screwdriver to fix this thing.
[613.46s -> 616.50s]  And batteries. I don't have any batteries. Just listen to the song. It's beautiful.
[620.03s -> 689.58s]  Captain Jack Sparrow. And his whimsical group of pirates. Take him on a new adventure.
[690.62s -> 707.09s]  This time in Assassin's Creed 8. Green flag. Instead of black flag. Orange flag. Coming next
[707.09s -> 742.91s]  month. Wait, those people just were on stage just to go, uh, for like five seconds.
[744.91s -> 785.01s]  I want somebody just to start leaving in the mic going. Yeah, I'll take the salmon. Uh,
[785.01s -> 789.33s]  can I get that with crispy skin? And instead of a risotto, can I get some, uh, spinach
[789.33s -> 804.53s]  waste? Oh, I would do that. I would do that. These big menus. I don't, I never get that. I
[804.53s -> 838.22s]  don't get it. I mean, it's beautiful. But why do they need the, kind of just, you know the
[838.30s -> 844.53s]  song. The song along with the beautiful music. It sounds like they start spacing their hands.
[845.17s -> 850.72s]  I'm not talking about the intro. I'm just talking about why you, when you're up on stage
[850.72s -> 866.48s]  playing with the folk though. You already love the song. Worldwide tour? What you just saw was
[866.48s -> 872.40s]  only a glimpse of the Assassin's Creed Symphony Tour starting on June 29th. Imagine an 80-piece
[872.40s -> 877.52s]  live orchestra and choir playing the iconic themes from Assassin's Creed while you relive
[877.52s -> 881.84s]  some of the most memorable moments from over a decade of Assassin's Creed in an immersive
[881.84s -> 889.12s]  experience. Check out acsymphony.com to learn more. I mean, excellent music, great performances,
[889.12s -> 893.36s]  goosebumps. If you like those things, I think those shows are going to be for you. But
[893.36s -> 898.96s]  of course there's one show that we all came here to see. The Ubisoft E3 conference. And
[898.96s -> 904.16s]  it's just about to start here from the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles. Now the house is packed
[904.16s -> 907.60s]  and to give you folks at home an idea what that feels like. Can I please hear the
[908.00s -> 913.20s]  show the line outside? Look at these losers. Look at them. They're still waiting to get in.
[913.92s -> 922.64s]  If you, if you please, if you please, I'd like to do the same for the people sitting on the
[922.64s -> 934.18s]  ground floor. And all the billions of people watching. Well, the excitement is here,
[934.18s -> 938.50s]  folks. We hope you're feeling the same way there from everyone at Ubisoft all around
[938.50s -> 945.10s]  the world. Please enjoy the show. That was, that was like a, I can't do that. That was
[945.10s -> 971.60s]  like a bang, wink. I can't do that. World premiere. That was a countdown. Okay, yeah.
[981.65s -> 988.35s]  Greatest city in the world. Well, used to be. Now it's a right mess.
[989.79s -> 996.27s]  Government's fucked off. Extremists are grabbing power. Organized crimes slicing up the
[996.27s -> 1004.03s]  boroughs. The war dogs are out. And freedom's a bloody joke. But this ain't there, London.
[1004.03s -> 1010.59s]  This is our London. And there's a new power growing. It's all of us together.
[1011.39s -> 1019.25s]  We're building a resistance. One recruit at a time. What's my favorite operative up to
[1019.25s -> 1024.13s]  this evening? And no, I never say that to the others. Scouting talent, Bagley. So gob
[1024.13s -> 1028.93s]  shut. Eyes peeled yet? I have no eyes. And if I did, I wouldn't peel them.
[1029.89s -> 1033.58s]  Fuck you, dinglebot. Where the fuck we go?
[1045.71s -> 1049.07s]  Bloody drones are everywhere. Kicking our fucking teeth in lately.
[1049.63s -> 1053.71s]  Then I recommend you recruit someone who can deal with drones. Brilliant. Never would
[1053.71s -> 1064.58s]  have thought of that. You're clear. They always do this long walking behind me segment.
[1065.54s -> 1070.18s]  Just punch somebody. You know what I mean? Sure, but we need a drone expert, Raj. Not a
[1070.18s -> 1076.54s]  shit kicker. File that one away for later. It always starts with like, well, let's slowly
[1076.54s -> 1084.91s]  walk down the same street. That's not what a gamer does. Gamer does like the fucking
[1084.91s -> 1088.75s]  full sprint. Like sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint. They just take the first
[1088.75s -> 1094.19s]  card they see. Nobody even plays Hitman like this. And that's how you're supposed
[1094.19s -> 1098.27s]  to play that game. Jimmy Shaw, no formal engineering training, but he has several
[1098.27s -> 1103.79s]  mischief charges for hijacking Albion drones. Hold still. Fuck you, man. You've got no
[1103.79s -> 1111.09s]  right. Fuck you, hell. We find our drone expert and he's about to get himself nicked.
[1111.09s -> 1196.86s]  Wait, die in the game? You die in real life in the game? Well, actually, that's kind
[1196.86s -> 1198.46s]  of cool. If you die in the game, you die in real life in the game.
[1226.02s -> 1227.06s]  This is pretty great, actually.
[1232.42s -> 1251.06s]  I hope it's the same animations for every character. That means Grandma can like
[1251.06s -> 1254.26s]  fucking rip people, punch people, kick them in like the face and shit like that.
[1254.26s -> 1255.62s]  You know they're going to use the same animations.
[1255.62s -> 1282.26s]  This is fucking amazing. This is the greatest thing ever.
[1293.41s -> 1295.18s]  Can I just play as Grandma the whole game?
[1304.50s -> 1307.14s]  It's going to suck when you pick a character and get instantly sniped.
[1307.78s -> 1310.50s]  It's going to cost like fucking credits and stuff like that.
[1319.30s -> 1322.98s]  It's an open world. You can fall off the edges. You can get hit by cars and stuff.
[1323.62s -> 1329.86s]  So many of my characters are going to die in this game. I'll be in that menu screen.
[1330.82s -> 1331.86s]  30% of the whole game.
[1350.53s -> 1353.49s]  That means every time you fail a mission, you have to use a new character
[1353.49s -> 1359.65s]  or surrender. I'm never going to be able to relate to anybody in this game.
[1388.05s -> 1393.87s]  They always make it look so easy, but that shit don't work like that.
[1394.75s -> 1398.29s]  You don't like do the Heimlich maneuver one time to somebody and you kill them.
[1416.42s -> 1422.82s]  You ever choke somebody up? You ever get choked out before? It takes like fucking five minutes.
[1423.06s -> 1425.06s]  You ever choke somebody?
[1428.06s -> 1433.18s]  No, no, listen. You ever been like fucking choked out before in like wrestling or like MMA?
[1436.46s -> 1439.66s]  It's like a struggle and it takes like fucking a full minute.
[1446.29s -> 1463.34s]  It takes like three minutes. Like remember when Ted DiBiase did that for his special move?
[1464.38s -> 1467.82s]  Hulk Hogan would be in that move for like five straight minutes. It doesn't take like five
[1467.82s -> 1468.46s]  seconds.
[1500.83s -> 1521.17s]  I would have gotten hit by that car. The person's all right.
[1542.61s -> 1550.03s]  That's how they'll take us one at a time. It doesn't have to be that way. Together,
[1550.03s -> 1561.70s]  we can change things. Wait, what happened to that bloke who helped me? He didn't make it.
[1573.68s -> 1586.43s]  Fuck it. Welcome to DedSec, James. Yeah, okay. So where do I go to meet the rest of the crew?
[1586.43s -> 1592.03s]  You don't need to go anywhere. Look around you. Everyone has a reason to fight and DedSec
[1592.03s -> 1602.98s]  is open to anyone. Welcome to the resistance. So any NPC can be a playable character if you
[1602.98s -> 1616.42s]  like convince them. NPCs are the new press F to get in the car. Ubisoft has just changed
[1616.42s -> 1626.54s]  the game here. But steal car in GTA without steal person. Like be a person. That's kind
[1626.54s -> 1640.69s]  of cool. I want more info on the fucking people's like body. It's not like stealing.
[1641.57s -> 1645.81s]  What am I doing? It's like they become an operative. I'm Clint Hawking. I'm the creative
[1645.81s -> 1651.33s]  director of Watch Dogs Legion. And for the past few years, the team and I have had the
[1651.33s -> 1657.33s]  privilege to work on a game and an innovation that we are very proud of.
[1658.29s -> 1663.73s]  Watch Dogs Legion is set in London, one of the greatest cities in the world, and it's
[1663.73s -> 1672.13s]  had a massive influence on all of our culture for centuries. Today, with Brexit, London's
[1672.13s -> 1677.09s]  at a turning point. It's hard to predict what the future holds for London, for
[1677.09s -> 1682.69s]  the UK, or for the world. So go recruit some old ladies and fucking drive around
[1682.69s -> 1684.93s]  and crash your cars.
[1712.69s -> 1720.83s]  To us all. And they are the heroes of our game. All of them. In Watch Dogs Legion,
[1720.83s -> 1725.07s]  your mission is to build a popular resistance to fight back against the emergence of an
[1725.07s -> 1730.27s]  authoritarian regime. This means you don't just play as one hero, but many. And in
[1730.27s -> 1740.93s]  Watch Dogs Legion, you can recruit and play as anyone. Oh, my God. That took
[1740.93s -> 1747.26s]  like a monocle off. Oh, my God. This is unbelievable. Never before have I seen
[1747.26s -> 1752.22s]  something like this. In our game, every Londoner is fully simulated with a
[1752.22s -> 1756.94s]  persistent life and relationships, and anyone from the entire population can be
[1756.94s -> 1762.30s]  recruited into your team. Find them, profile them, hack into their lives, play
[1762.30s -> 1765.90s]  their origin mission, and win them over to your cause. The heroes you
[1765.90s -> 1769.58s]  recruit are all unique characters with different backstories and
[1769.58s -> 1774.46s]  personalities, fully voiced and animated, and they are the stars of your
[1774.46s -> 1779.18s]  story. Every cinematic in the game will change, depending on whether you're
[1779.18s -> 1783.98s]  playing a former MI5 action hero, a 70-year-old grandiose off-feeding pigeons
[1783.98s -> 1787.50s]  in the park, or anyone in between. However you want to play,
[1788.86s -> 1793.50s]  whoever you want to be, Watch Dogs Legion lets you be that. Fighting
[1793.50s -> 1797.74s]  against an authoritarian regime. They're taking us over. They're trying
[1797.74s -> 1804.70s]  to get rid of us. They're killing us. Hack into the people's lives and break
[1804.70s -> 1812.86s]  their privacy and then force them to be part of your system. Hack into their lives
[1812.86s -> 1820.56s]  and take them over. Play as anyone is the innovation that transforms a story
[1820.56s -> 1825.36s]  about freeing London and the world from the grip of tyranny into a game
[1825.36s -> 1830.32s]  about the heroes that live in each of us. Because being a hero isn't just a job
[1830.32s -> 1835.20s]  for someone else anymore. It's a job for everyone. So on behalf of the
[1835.20s -> 1839.04s]  Watch Dogs Legion's team here and around the world, I hope to see you on
[1839.04s -> 1842.32s]  the booth. Thank you for your time and welcome to the Resistance.
[1843.84s -> 1844.80s]  That'll be fun. We will.
[1845.84s -> 1856.72s]  Had a good run there for a while. Now it's all riots,
[1856.72s -> 1868.14s]  riots, bombings, people thrown in cages like animals. Oh, I know you can forget
[1868.14s -> 1876.18s]  the killer robots everywhere. So yeah, that's all gonna be shit.
[1879.01s -> 1885.17s]  It's up to us to take our city back. The thing is, we can't do it alone.
[1885.17s -> 1890.61s]  We need to recruit a Resistance. I know what you're thinking. Where do we start?
[1891.33s -> 1899.10s]  Open your eyes and take a look around. Look here. Look at him. No, not him.
[1899.90s -> 1910.43s]  Him. Former MI5. Duty never ends. He can get anywhere and erase anyone.
[1914.16s -> 1915.84s]  Let's kick those bastards out of London.
[1917.04s -> 1920.88s]  She got kicked out of Oxbridge Robotics School for teaching him to reproduce.
[1921.36s -> 1933.68s]  Oh, come on. Come at me. He'll crack your skull. Just there's like there's a handful
[1933.68s -> 1937.36s]  of different classes. I think that granny was a robot expert.
[1942.59s -> 1950.40s]  This had better be fucking good to introduce you to the deadliest of the law.
[1951.12s -> 1953.52s]  She's not old. She's experienced.
[1954.48s -> 1961.30s]  Like I said, you can recruit anyone. And I'll mean bloody anyone.
[1963.22s -> 1974.53s]  Him. Her. Everyone is a secret weapon. Find them. Build the Resistance.
[1975.73s -> 1981.26s]  Let's unfuck this world.
[1992.18s -> 2011.31s]  Anyone. Yeah. Even me? Even animals. Grandma makes that. I mean, I know I'm like,
[2011.39s -> 2022.99s]  biased, but. Microwave? It's always sunny in Philadelphia.
[2022.99s -> 2036.46s]  Hello. My name is Rob McElhenney and for the past 14 years I have been making a television
[2036.46s -> 2040.38s]  show called It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Are you fucking serious?
[2042.00s -> 2048.24s]  Thank you. But I am here today because I love games. And I wanted to express that
[2048.24s -> 2053.20s]  love in the only way that I know how save for playing them. And that is to make a TV show
[2053.20s -> 2056.88s]  about them. More importantly, the people who create those games and the people who
[2056.88s -> 2062.00s]  play them. So last year I called the funniest people that I knew. Charlie Day,
[2062.00s -> 2065.20s]  Megan Ganz and David Hornsby. All executive producers on Sunny.
[2065.84s -> 2070.32s]  And we started talking. We realized very early on that if we were going to do this,
[2070.32s -> 2075.36s]  we wanted to do it right and to be as authentic as possible because as you all know,
[2075.36s -> 2081.70s]  nobody smells bullshit like this particular community. So we did the right thing.
[2081.70s -> 2087.30s]  We partnered with Ubisoft and away we went. It has been an incredible experience working
[2087.30s -> 2090.74s]  with one of the biggest and best game developers in the world to inspire us
[2091.30s -> 2095.78s]  because our show takes place in the fictional studio that created the biggest
[2095.78s -> 2103.06s]  MMORPG in the world, Mythic Quest. And we meet them on the cusp of releasing
[2103.06s -> 2108.58s]  their biggest expansion yet, Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet. The show follows the team
[2108.58s -> 2112.42s]  of devs as they navigate the challenges of running their game while dealing with the
[2112.42s -> 2118.90s]  difficulties of modern office life. These cut back to back stage like Frank's back there.
[2118.90s -> 2123.14s]  This scheme is going to work. Dennis, shut up. The head of the team is my character,
[2123.14s -> 2132.54s]  creative director, Ian Grim. Why are you covered in oil? I don't understand what that's
[2132.54s -> 2134.54s]  for. This part of scheme.
[2163.90s -> 2169.58s]  Short of the best that they can make because that is what the community you deserve.
[2170.30s -> 2173.34s]  I promise you that in making this show, we took the same approach.
[2174.46s -> 2180.30s]  So without further ado, here's a brief look into our upcoming TV series for Apple TV plus
[2180.30s -> 2185.90s]  Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet. Apple TV plus. What is Apple TV plus?
[2187.60s -> 2194.70s]  What is Mythic Quest? Some may say it's just a video game.
[2198.16s -> 2205.20s]  When it first debuted, MQ was hailed as a masterpiece. Now played in 20 different countries
[2205.20s -> 2211.84s]  on six continents, it's the biggest massive multiplayer role playing game of all time.
[2214.40s -> 2219.76s]  And today, they find themselves on the precipice of their first major expansion,
[2220.48s -> 2228.32s]  Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet. And it all falls on the shoulders of one man,
[2228.96s -> 2233.68s]  creative director, Ian Grim. When we think about cultural touchstones,
[2234.56s -> 2241.84s]  we think ET, Star Wars, Avatar, and yet our industry dwarfs the traditional entertainment
[2241.84s -> 2248.72s]  business. So when we think about legends, why not think Mythic Quest?
[2248.72s -> 2255.44s]  True indeed. And when we think of visionary world building artists, instead of just Spielberg,
[2255.44s -> 2268.13s]  Lucas and Cameron, why not think Grim? I'm sorry, I gotta stop. What is this?
[2269.25s -> 2272.69s]  It's a commercial for the game. It's a commercial for you. It's still going.
[2276.08s -> 2283.87s]  This is insane. I think it's brilliant.
[2284.59s -> 2308.19s]  This is a TV show. This is not a game. This is a game. I know this song. You gotta play the best
[2308.19s -> 2316.13s]  part when they scream where they're from. Hey there, my name is Parker and Taro Makai,
[2316.13s -> 2318.77s]  esports caster for Rainbow Six Siege. Celebrity showdown.
[2318.77s -> 2324.13s]  There are so many exciting things to come in year four. In-game events, map reworks,
[2324.13s -> 2328.85s]  playlist updates, a roster of 52 unique operators, and of course, a thriving
[2328.85s -> 2335.41s]  esports scene. Starting tomorrow, you'll be able to enjoy our 13th season, Operation Phantom
[2335.41s -> 2341.57s]  Sight. This major content update brings two new operators to T-Rainbow, Nook and Warden.
[2341.57s -> 2346.85s]  After this show, be sure to stick around for an intense celebrity match starring T-Pain,
[2346.85s -> 2350.53s]  Little Yachty, and some of your favorite Twitch streamers for the Twitch Rivals
[2350.53s -> 2355.33s]  celebrity show match. But right now, here's a glimpse of the new season in action.
[2355.33s -> 2357.33s]  Thank you, everyone, and have a great E3.
[2472.48s -> 2479.36s]  Brawlhalla master. These things are whack. One v one me, bro. For real. Uh, yeah. I'll
[2479.36s -> 2484.64s]  toast your buns again. Sure. Want to choose a different character? Yeah, I choose me.
[2492.16s -> 2502.98s]  Yeah. They inked it. Adventure time deal here. Whoa, it's those guys from the game.
[2515.23s -> 2532.45s]  Oh, are they just going to take over the game? They start introducing way more adventure
[2532.45s -> 2571.41s]  time characters. They're just skins. Oh, okay. Are they? Dude, I'm not fucking around here.
[2572.29s -> 2575.73s]  Wouldn't you love like a Smash Brothers cartoon fucking roster game?
[2576.69s -> 2581.49s]  Wren, Stimpy, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ed, Edd, and Eddie. I have like 400 characters in
[2581.49s -> 2584.77s]  the game. I don't care. Oh, actually, that already exists. It's called, it's called Mewman.
[2584.77s -> 2594.34s]  That already, that's already a thing. Let's just play that. The only test of a man's worth
[2595.58s -> 2602.00s]  is battle. When those rounds come screaming past your head, you're gonna learn if you
[2602.00s -> 2612.59s]  are hungry enough, hungry enough to take that victory. We're going to battle with
[2612.59s -> 2620.62s]  the soldiers that we used to be. Ghosts. And you better believe that they are hungry too.
[2621.50s -> 2625.68s]  Once upon a time, some of these ghosts, they may have been your friends.
[2626.56s -> 2634.06s]  And there is brotherhood. But then there is what the world needs. These ghosts,
[2634.06s -> 2641.33s]  they are the past. They still serve the machine that we left behind. And right now,
[2642.13s -> 2652.99s]  for the future, the world needs us. I'm honored. I want somebody to make a game where you play.
[2652.99s -> 2656.51s]  I'm honored to be here with you tonight. And everybody's getting sick of like these,
[2656.51s -> 2661.63s]  as you head into battle, we need to fight now. Look in your eye, those bad intentions
[2661.63s -> 2670.61s]  in your mind. Remember this. You are the few with the courage to make history.
[2671.57s -> 2674.59s]  You had the desire to take victory.
[2675.55s -> 2688.30s]  You will be on a battlefield full of ghosts, but only you have that hunger that makes you wolves.
[2698.80s -> 2702.72s]  Ghost Recon Breakpoint. Ghost Recon Wildlands. Ghost Recon
[2703.76s -> 2711.39s]  Constant Conflict. That's what they should just name it. Ghost Recon Constant Conflict 3.
[2712.27s -> 2717.87s]  Good to be here. This is the dog on screen. Click dog. Click dog on screen. It's a dog.
[2718.99s -> 2723.22s]  It's a real honor to be here with you guys today. Thank you. I love you too.
[2724.50s -> 2728.18s]  This is awesome. This has been really great and exciting. And I'm really,
[2728.18s -> 2734.34s]  I'm really honored. Dog on screen. I'm enormously proud to be part of the development
[2734.34s -> 2739.70s]  of this game. It was a pleasure to work with the Ubisoft team. You know, I've had
[2739.70s -> 2744.82s]  the chance to play some pretty strong, tough men over the years. I've played a deputy fighting
[2744.82s -> 2755.70s]  zombies, special forces soldier who lost everything. And now I get to play Cole D. Walker. He's a
[2755.70s -> 2760.50s]  skilled former special operations soldier with his own sense of responsibility and his own
[2760.50s -> 2766.66s]  moral code. He knows how things should be run. He loves his brothers, his fellow soldiers,
[2767.22s -> 2772.10s]  but he is willing to do whatever it takes to complete his mission and take control of Aroha.
[2772.90s -> 2778.02s]  There is no briefing. There's no backup. You will not face a group of bad guys or
[2778.02s -> 2784.02s]  a criminal organization. You will face an entire army. My army. Good boy. The wolves.
[2791.50s -> 2796.78s]  We've got the numbers. We've got the organization. And remember, we trained alongside
[2796.78s -> 2803.34s]  you the weaponry of a fully operational special ops detachment. Trust me. There's
[2803.34s -> 2809.42s]  an unparalleled arsenal of high tech weapons in Aroha. So if you think you have what it takes,
[2810.30s -> 2815.90s]  strap on your boots and you get ready to take on the wolves. I wasn't paying them. Take on
[2815.90s -> 2829.10s]  me. See you in a row. We'll be waiting. Perfect predators. I was sorry, there's a dog on the
[2829.10s -> 2843.31s]  screen. I literally nothing else matters. Have the element of surprise. They have the technology,
[2845.70s -> 2873.04s]  but we have the skills to even the odds. They have an army who we fight with our
[2873.04s -> 2875.04s]  brothers and sisters.
[2882.06s -> 2895.02s]  Fight. They are hungry. Take up arms. We are enraged. Fight. Fight. All we do is fight.
[2895.02s -> 2903.81s]  You're ghosts and ghosts. And they always do that like fucking rip the head tape down and
[2903.81s -> 2908.13s]  that fucking head hits the ground. You know, conflict. Ghost recon. Constant conflict. Full.
[2908.93s -> 2923.68s]  Rip his fucking head to the ground. I'm not insane. That was, I was talking about a video
[2923.68s -> 2932.61s]  game. That was a video game. We're talking about video games. Being a community developer
[2932.61s -> 2937.89s]  on Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint has been an incredible journey for me so far.
[2939.15s -> 2945.31s]  When we first announced the game, you were very excited. And after discussions of members
[2945.39s -> 2952.43s]  of our community, I today announce that with our post launch plan, we will be bringing back our
[2952.43s -> 2965.46s]  AI teammates for our solo players. Wait, what does this mean? Ghost Recon Breakpoint.
[2966.10s -> 2972.56s]  We want to go the extra mile with how we engage with you. So I'm pleased to announce
[2973.36s -> 2981.04s]  a brand new community program that will allow you to express and share your passion.
[2982.56s -> 2997.89s]  Welcome to Ghost Recon Delta Company. From cosplay to streaming, fan art to forum
[2997.89s -> 3004.05s]  discussions. However, you show your love for Ghost Recon, there is something for you in our
[3004.05s -> 3011.25s]  five different detachments. You like crushing heads against walls and smashing direct discussions
[3011.25s -> 3017.01s]  with our studio. So head over to our Ghost Recon Breakpoint website to find out more
[3017.89s -> 3021.89s]  and hear from you soon, Delta Ghosts. Thank you very much, everyone.
[3039.58s -> 3050.80s]  Thank you, Laura. Hello, everyone. The Ghost Recon team has always taken great pride
[3050.80s -> 3057.28s]  from your passion for our games. And that passion is what pushes us to deliver
[3057.28s -> 3064.94s]  the best pickups experience out there. Behind enemy lines, you will be fighting the most
[3064.94s -> 3070.38s]  dangerous enemies the Ghosts have ever faced. Conflict. Constantly testing your survival skills.
[3072.50s -> 3078.88s]  Yes, we can't wait to welcome you in Ghost Recon Breakpoint on October 4th.
[3080.85s -> 3086.77s]  And one month before that, our beta will be live on September 5th.
[3097.04s -> 3101.04s]  You can register on our website right now for a chance to participate.
[3102.94s -> 3106.06s]  Ghost Recon Breakpoint will be live for years to come.
[3107.97s -> 3124.88s]  We've got your back. New content, free updates, and many surprises inspired by our community.
[3129.90s -> 3137.34s]  Yes, yes. Like this one. I haven't said anything. I've got, I don't really have,
[3137.34s -> 3141.02s]  I don't know anything about this. All I know is it's just conflict. That's all I know.
[3142.06s -> 3149.10s]  It's the Terminator. The Terminator. No, why does everybody have to have the Terminator
[3149.10s -> 3162.34s]  in a game? Did they ink the deal at the same time? Another Terminator. Will you survive
[3162.34s -> 3168.58s]  your break point? That looked a lot better in the mirror. All right. I'll tell you.
[3168.90s -> 3172.66s]  I mean, I've done that before. I know what it's like. I've done that before.
[3178.69s -> 3192.64s]  Why the Terminator? There has to be some weird reason why this fucking two Terminator instances
[3192.64s -> 3209.90s]  here. Conflict. She's all in. She's ready to shoot and punch, crush her head. She's got her
[3209.90s -> 3219.12s]  Terminator ready to crush heads. Her best defense is this crush head.
[3236.29s -> 3239.17s]  Squishing heads like Goro between her hands.
[3256.32s -> 3264.61s]  Lead the elite squad. They're all elite squads in every game. Every single one of them.
[3266.93s -> 3269.09s]  I want a group of people that have no fucking idea what they're doing.
[3269.09s -> 3273.65s]  Pre-register now. Why do we, I don't want this anymore. I want to be like a moron
[3273.65s -> 3275.57s]  that doesn't have any training, that doesn't know how to do anything.
[3277.02s -> 3280.54s]  It's the most elite specialists. No, I want to be a guy, I want to be like a fucking
[3280.54s -> 3284.06s]  sewing master. I don't, I don't want to be like a fucking specialist anymore.
[3285.02s -> 3300.29s]  10 years. 10 years. That's a lot of dancing. We're exhausted. I know. But think of everything
[3300.29s -> 3308.67s]  we've done. It's not for us, or for you, or you. It's for them, the press.
[3310.27s -> 3316.74s]  We danced and Sivio and his girlfriend got married. We danced and our friend
[3316.82s -> 3324.98s]  Jaden Rodriguez danced for millions, bringing together generations. We danced and they set
[3324.98s -> 3331.30s]  world records. Do you remember Carrie? Of course we do because we were with her.
[3333.30s -> 3337.86s]  Dance is why we exist. And I know we're going to have much more of these moments
[3337.86s -> 3341.14s]  because dance is a force. I was about to be in a magician game, but
[3341.14s -> 3345.14s]  700 million people use this as a workout routine.
[3348.10s -> 3373.47s]  Could have got the magician game. There's so many prime examples on the stage right now.
[3373.47s -> 3424.48s]  The magician game. 10 years. We got like 10 more years before the S&P is going to crash.
[3452.82s -> 3456.42s]  I feel like it's weirder for me to be watching this.
[3457.06s -> 3461.06s]  Then it is. I feel like I need to be there. I'm like embarrassed to be here.
[3461.06s -> 3466.90s]  No, because this is like great dancing. It is. This is like fantastic display of talented people.
[3466.90s -> 3474.86s]  But like I'm just kind of like, I feel like maybe if I was there,
[3480.70s -> 3489.39s]  get up and dance. Nobody else is doing that. I'm just kind of like, I guess I'm here still.
[3491.20s -> 3493.12s]  Those people are so much more talented than me.
[3494.08s -> 3518.58s]  We got some hype in the chat, please. There's an old tale about this village.
[3518.58s -> 3523.70s]  This is still going on. A samurai came to deliver justice.
[3525.62s -> 3533.06s]  Nest clouded her mind. She slaughtered every living soul.
[3537.49s -> 3545.30s]  Became the spirit of death. Comes the Terminator.
[3546.26s -> 3550.26s]  Years later, we hunted the samurai in the village.
[3551.38s -> 3557.70s]  We didn't believe the old tale. Not until a horror came.
[3565.17s -> 3568.21s]  Spirits hungered for our souls.
[3569.01s -> 3602.13s]  Sakura is the spirit of death.
[3604.61s -> 3608.93s]  She's brought a curse that will doom us all.
[3615.87s -> 3624.42s]  We got another one. They lined it up tonight.
[3628.99s -> 3655.06s]  We got a flatliner raid coming in.
[3655.54s -> 3703.98s]  Rainbow Six quarantine. Free player.
[3710.03s -> 3715.79s]  Hi, I'm Biojad, and I'm the lead game designer on the next Rainbow Six game.
[3717.07s -> 3721.23s]  They're really, really, let's say something about like 2019.
[3721.23s -> 3723.71s]  It's called Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.
[3723.71s -> 3725.23s]  They don't want to call a game anything else.
[3725.87s -> 3730.67s]  I'm part of a new team in Ubisoft Montreal that set out on an exciting
[3730.99s -> 3737.47s]  mission. Create a radically redesigned co-op experience built on the
[3737.47s -> 3741.95s]  foundations of one of the best shooters of this generation.
[3743.31s -> 3745.95s]  What siege is to the PvP shooter genre?
[3746.91s -> 3749.95s]  We will be to PvE co-op.
[3752.53s -> 3757.82s]  All right, that's, this is interesting. This is pretty interesting.
[3757.82s -> 3760.94s]  Quarantine will test your tactical skills and survive.
[3760.94s -> 3761.90s]  Three player co-op.
[3762.78s -> 3766.54s]  Holding you and your operators on the razors edge.
[3767.98s -> 3774.62s]  It pulls you together as a squad facing off against an unknown and
[3774.62s -> 3775.98s]  devastating parasite.
[3777.42s -> 3783.66s]  You will risk everything every time you step into quarantine.
[3784.86s -> 3789.26s]  Stay tuned and start prepping for your next deployment.
[3789.34s -> 3792.70s]  I can't wait to show you more and have a great E3.
[3792.70s -> 3795.98s]  No, that was like the coolest thing possibly here today.
[3797.10s -> 3798.62s]  A three player co-op game.
[3799.58s -> 3801.79s]  We'll just get to see the trailer.
[3805.07s -> 3807.15s]  See you in like two years when that's ready to play.
[3822.18s -> 3822.98s]  Give me a clip of me.
[3823.94s -> 3824.98s]  Give me a clip of me.
[3826.11s -> 3826.99s]  There has to be one.
[3826.99s -> 3828.99s]  What did I play? I played like Far Cry 5.
[3829.95s -> 3837.18s]  There's not a clip of me going like, what the heck?
[3837.18s -> 3838.06s]  Like there has to be.
[3838.06s -> 3839.58s]  There's at least 10,000 of those.
[3843.12s -> 3844.64s]  Fucking epic.
[3844.64s -> 3846.96s]  All right, there's got to be like at least a dozen of them.
[3846.96s -> 3847.68s]  I've done it before.
[3852.46s -> 3853.90s]  No, don't clip that one.
[3854.46s -> 3857.98s]  As creative director at Red Storm Entertainment.
[3857.98s -> 3859.98s]  I'm not, I'm irrelevant.
[3859.98s -> 3865.90s]  There's no greater reward for me or the team than to see our game come to life
[3867.10s -> 3870.06s]  and to see our players, our star players,
[3870.86s -> 3875.02s]  taking tremendous pride in being a part of the division.
[3880.70s -> 3883.98s]  Now, if you haven't had the opportunity to play The Division 2 yet,
[3884.62s -> 3889.58s]  we would be thrilled to have you join our very passionate community
[3889.58s -> 3892.94s]  because I'm happy to announce that this week only,
[3893.42s -> 3896.86s]  between June 13th and June 16th,
[3896.86s -> 3902.86s]  The Division 2 will be absolutely 100% free for everyone to play.
[3904.70s -> 3912.56s]  And there's no better time to join us as we're about to release
[3912.56s -> 3916.08s]  the first of our major content updates for our year one journey.
[3916.08s -> 3917.60s]  Play free for three days.
[3917.60s -> 3918.88s]  A journey beyond Washington DC.
[3918.88s -> 3920.56s]  That shit's not even long enough to go through the tutorial.
[3920.56s -> 3924.56s]  To save not just a city, but an entire nation.
[3951.10s -> 3951.66s]  Conflict.
[3952.62s -> 3957.18s]  All right.
[3957.18s -> 3958.42s]  All right.
[3958.42s -> 3959.22s]  Different kinds of conflict.
[3959.22s -> 3960.74s]  I want animal conflict.
[3960.74s -> 3961.14s]  Thank you.
[3961.86s -> 3962.66s]  Episode one.
[3962.66s -> 3964.18s]  Like a jungle game.
[3964.18s -> 3964.82s]  Right around the corner.
[3964.82s -> 3965.86s]  You call it a line.
[3965.86s -> 3970.90s]  We deliver to you new main missions and a brand new game experience.
[3971.70s -> 3975.46s]  For the first time, we're taking the fight outside the city
[3976.18s -> 3980.34s]  and you'll venture deep into the woodlands to spearhead an attack
[3980.34s -> 3984.74s]  on a presidential compound as you seek to bring a traitor to justice.
[3985.86s -> 3988.74s]  The National Zoo is the setting of our next mission.
[3988.74s -> 3989.06s]  Zoo.
[3989.06s -> 3993.06s]  Where you and your team will hunt down the surviving outcast leader.
[3993.06s -> 3994.58s]  You and your team play as snakes.
[3994.58s -> 3997.30s]  This brings us to our final edition of episode one.
[3997.30s -> 3999.38s]  A place called Kenley College.
[3999.38s -> 4001.86s]  And it's home to an entirely new gameplay experience.
[4002.74s -> 4006.98s]  One that will take exploration, investigation, and logic
[4007.78s -> 4011.78s]  to uncover the fate of a military convoy gone dark.
[4011.78s -> 4013.78s]  I'm getting sick of like backpack sprints.
[4013.78s -> 4014.28s]  Episode two.
[4015.06s -> 4019.62s]  Coming this fall, we'll bring to you the Pentagon.
[4025.42s -> 4029.92s]  Once an impenetrable fortress, it has fallen to the black tusks.
[4029.92s -> 4030.80s]  You got a backpack on?
[4030.80s -> 4032.88s]  Secrets are about to be thrown out into the open.
[4032.88s -> 4033.76s]  Are you running like this?
[4033.76s -> 4039.28s]  You must do everything it takes to secure what lies behind the walls of this last castle.
[4040.64s -> 4042.64s]  But this won't be the greatest danger you face in episode two.
[4042.64s -> 4043.68s]  Really fucking zoo game.
[4043.68s -> 4044.80s]  No, I know zoo.
[4044.80s -> 4045.60s]  There's like plenty of those.
[4046.24s -> 4049.04s]  That our second grade will be coming this fall.
[4049.04s -> 4051.04s]  Bringing back intense eight-player action.
[4052.00s -> 4052.80s]  Yeah.
[4052.80s -> 4056.45s]  You tackled the first raid.
[4056.45s -> 4057.73s]  It was awesome.
[4057.73s -> 4060.77s]  And we cannot wait to see what world records you break this time around.
[4060.77s -> 4061.25s]  Caveman.
[4061.25s -> 4062.53s]  They already kind of did that.
[4062.53s -> 4065.89s]  This brings us to our third and final episode of year one.
[4068.03s -> 4073.79s]  What if rebirth was not about bringing the world as we know it back to life?
[4074.67s -> 4075.55s]  But the opposite.
[4077.52s -> 4079.36s]  One man holds that power.
[4080.16s -> 4082.72s]  And humanity itself is at stake.
[4084.00s -> 4086.56s]  Can you guys guess if he's a special operative?
[4086.56s -> 4088.96s]  It's time to engage in a manhunt.
[4088.96s -> 4091.60s]  Let's see.
[4092.93s -> 4096.21s]  Let's see how like skilled and talented and special operative this guy is.
[4097.25s -> 4097.73s]  Poor girl.
[4110.45s -> 4110.95s]  Sorry.
[4116.02s -> 4117.54s]  No, no, he's just got a backpack on.
[4117.54s -> 4118.58s]  He's got a gun.
[4118.58s -> 4119.22s]  He's trained.
[4119.86s -> 4122.93s]  We fought to protect the weak.
[4122.93s -> 4130.37s]  But training doesn't prepare you to hunt someone you used to call brother.
[4130.37s -> 4134.86s]  He has left us no other choice.
[4136.88s -> 4141.20s]  If we don't stop him, there will be nothing left to save.
[4145.81s -> 4147.33s]  Holy shit, what about that?
[4149.73s -> 4151.76s]  I can't wait for that.
[4153.04s -> 4154.72s]  Okay, one last thing.
[4155.68s -> 4159.12s]  As you might know, we have been working on a movie.
[4160.08s -> 4166.48s]  It will be directed by David Leitch, starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal.
[4166.48s -> 4174.48s]  Well, today, I'm proud to announce that we will be making the Division movie with Netflix.
[4175.04s -> 4177.20s]  More to come on that in the future.
[4177.20s -> 4178.56s]  Thank you very much.
[4178.56s -> 4178.96s]  Thank you.
[4181.84s -> 4184.00s]  Okay, that just has like a bag of rice.
[4184.72s -> 4188.64s]  That just has like now South Park already made this joke.
[4190.00s -> 4190.64s]  It was a good joke.
[4191.44s -> 4193.28s]  That's a pretty good South Park joke that I was about to make.
[4200.18s -> 4204.34s]  Hello, I'm Brenda Panagrossi.
[4204.34s -> 4207.54s]  I'm vice president of platform and product management.
[4208.26s -> 4211.54s]  Ubisoft has been creating worlds for over 30 years.
[4211.54s -> 4212.26s]  Uno.
[4212.26s -> 4214.98s]  We have the most diverse library of games,
[4214.98s -> 4218.02s]  and we're about to make it even easier for you to play them.
[4218.02s -> 4222.50s]  Uno, except the cards all have backpacks on and guns.
[4223.46s -> 4224.18s]  It's perfect.
[4224.74s -> 4226.18s]  Called Uplay Plus.
[4226.18s -> 4227.38s]  And they shoot at each other.
[4234.19s -> 4237.71s]  You'll get earliest available access to new games,
[4237.71s -> 4241.95s]  including the premium editions with all their additional content.
[4241.95s -> 4247.31s]  And you can enjoy the depth of our PC catalog that includes over 100 games and growing.
[4247.31s -> 4248.35s]  We talked about this yesterday.
[4248.35s -> 4258.61s]  It's like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV Plus, HBO Now, it's going to be Ubisoft Now,
[4258.61s -> 4263.17s]  Microsoft Go, Square Enix, yay.
[4263.81s -> 4268.05s]  We'll enable free access in September at launch.
[4284.38s -> 4285.18s]  But here's the thing.
[4285.82s -> 4289.42s]  If you buy one game a month, this is where the notification comes from.
[4289.42s -> 4295.50s]  If you buy like one or two games a month, it's $60 to $120 a month, right?
[4297.02s -> 4303.26s]  Well, I mean, then why don't you just pay $88 a month every month
[4303.26s -> 4304.54s]  and get access to everything?
[4305.58s -> 4308.30s]  You know, it's like, ah, it's going to happen.
[4309.50s -> 4312.56s]  Speak up.
[4312.56s -> 4313.44s]  Did you not hear my point?
[4313.44s -> 4320.19s]  I just made a pretty good point that you just don't know the games.
[4320.19s -> 4322.35s]  Yeah, you will not own those games.
[4322.35s -> 4324.67s]  But there's going to be the next five years.
[4324.67s -> 4327.39s]  So you're going to see like the $15 from Microsoft a month,
[4327.39s -> 4331.63s]  $15 from Ubisoft, $20 from Square Enix.
[4331.63s -> 4332.99s]  I keep making these companies up.
[4332.99s -> 4334.19s]  Maybe even like companies like Nintendo.
[4334.19s -> 4335.07s]  It doesn't matter.
[4335.07s -> 4338.51s]  Sony like $18.99 for the PS Plus Power Pass.
[4339.23s -> 4341.39s]  It's going to be like $120 a month if you get them all.
[4342.19s -> 4343.39s]  Or you just buy the games.
[4343.39s -> 4345.07s]  They're going to slowly going to make it a reality.
[4351.90s -> 4356.94s]  Players are we want to provide access to our games and services.
[4356.94s -> 4360.06s]  I'm pleased to announce that in 2020,
[4360.06s -> 4363.18s]  Uplay Plus will be available on Stadia.
[4364.46s -> 4371.04s]  Cue the appropriate enthusiasm music.
[4371.04s -> 4373.60s]  Stadia is the new generation gaming platform
[4373.60s -> 4376.48s]  where you could play our Stadia games from any device.
[4377.20s -> 4380.16s]  A special thank you to Phil Harrison and his team.
[4381.04s -> 4382.88s]  This is the beginning of our partnership.
[4388.30s -> 4389.66s]  I'm not muted.
[4389.66s -> 4393.82s]  I can see I'm looking right now at my audio device.
[4393.82s -> 4394.54s]  Thank you so much.
[4394.54s -> 4395.42s]  Have fun playing.
[4399.79s -> 4402.35s]  And it's not it's just the explore.
[4402.35s -> 4403.55s]  It's where we're going in the future.
[4403.55s -> 4404.83s]  Subscription based models.
[4404.83s -> 4405.95s]  Everybody wants to have one.
[4406.91s -> 4447.22s]  Skateboard.
[4469.20s -> 4470.40s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[4476.10s -> 4479.20s]  Basketball, future champions, football.
[4479.20s -> 4484.08s]  My name is Stefan and I'm a proud member of the roller champions team.
[4485.60s -> 4489.52s]  All right, come on, bring it up.
[4491.01s -> 4491.81s]  From the get-go.
[4491.81s -> 4492.61s]  Everyone starts getting up.
[4492.61s -> 4493.65s]  Let's get on stage.
[4493.73s -> 4494.77s]  We're very clear.
[4494.77s -> 4495.73s]  I'm going to sit down, sit down.
[4495.73s -> 4497.09s]  We wanted to create something new.
[4497.65s -> 4500.93s]  We wanted to capture the intangible excitement
[4500.93s -> 4503.65s]  of players preparing for the big game.
[4503.65s -> 4506.77s]  The hype of team play and competition
[4506.77s -> 4509.65s]  along with the craziness of high speed racing.
[4510.21s -> 4512.69s]  So we started working on roller champions.
[4512.69s -> 4516.69s]  A skill based team PVP sports game
[4516.69s -> 4520.05s]  that is as fun to watch as it is to play.
[4520.69s -> 4524.69s]  A game in which you, the player, can create your own story
[4524.69s -> 4526.13s]  as you roll up to glory.
[4527.33s -> 4529.09s]  But right now I know how it looks.
[4529.73s -> 4532.61s]  We showed you a trailer and I got on stage
[4532.61s -> 4533.81s]  starting my little speech.
[4534.37s -> 4535.65s]  That's all well and good.
[4536.21s -> 4538.53s]  But when will you ever get to play this?
[4539.97s -> 4540.93s]  How about today?
[4542.45s -> 4547.50s]  He said today.
[4548.30s -> 4551.22s]  All right, that was actually kind of a bad idea.
[4551.94s -> 4554.58s]  When we're done here, I want you to head over to play
[4554.58s -> 4558.90s]  on your PC to download a pre-alpha E3 demo
[4558.90s -> 4560.66s]  of roller champions.
[4560.66s -> 4563.78s]  Play the heck out of it for the next few days.
[4563.78s -> 4564.26s]  Play it now.
[4564.26s -> 4565.78s]  When you're done, head to the forums
[4565.78s -> 4567.06s]  to tell us what you thought.
[4567.86s -> 4568.50s]  And you know what?
[4569.30s -> 4572.26s]  We firmly believe that you will be screaming
[4572.26s -> 4573.94s]  as loudly as our colleagues did
[4573.94s -> 4575.46s]  when they first got to play this.
[4575.46s -> 4577.14s]  I'm not going to play it right now.
[4578.42s -> 4579.94s]  But I can't just leave you with that.
[4580.90s -> 4583.46s]  So here's a taste of what you should expect
[4584.10s -> 4585.38s]  once you click that download button.
[4585.38s -> 4586.34s]  I probably can't even stream it.
[4586.34s -> 4588.34s]  It's probably like not allowed.
[4589.94s -> 4604.58s]  People are streaming it right now.
[4604.58s -> 4607.78s]  I don't want to go download champion ball.
[4608.50s -> 4611.73s]  I have to go like sign up and shit.
[4611.73s -> 4613.41s]  I don't want to do this right now.
[4615.25s -> 4618.82s]  You want me to go download this game right now?
[4618.82s -> 4621.14s]  And like, why would I do this?
[4621.14s -> 4623.66s]  It's probably fun, but I don't want...
[4623.66s -> 4626.72s]  I'm not, no, I'm not doing it.
[4626.72s -> 4627.76s]  I saw one person sit down.
[4627.76s -> 4628.56s]  So I'm not doing it.
[4649.30s -> 4651.54s]  They're trying to tap into that rocket lead.
[4651.54s -> 4653.47s]  Kind of, it kind of is...
[4656.14s -> 4667.86s]  So first, I want to say thank you to...
[4668.66s -> 4669.94s]  All right, I wasn't paying.
[4669.94s -> 4671.14s]  I thought that was John Lithgow.
[4672.26s -> 4673.30s]  I really did.
[4674.26s -> 4675.94s]  I was like, John's John Lithgow.
[4675.94s -> 4678.10s]  Thank you to all the Ubisoft teams
[4678.10s -> 4681.06s]  around the world for your talent and energy.
[4681.70s -> 4684.18s]  You know, congratulations for another great show.
[4685.38s -> 4686.42s]  I thought everyone was like cheering
[4686.42s -> 4688.02s]  because like, holy shit, like John Lithgow
[4688.02s -> 4688.58s]  was like on stage.
[4688.58s -> 4690.10s]  He's probably in like one of the games or something.
[4691.06s -> 4696.74s]  I believe video games have a positive impact on...
[4696.74s -> 4699.22s]  I got out of my like area I'm allowed in.
[4699.86s -> 4703.54s]  At Ubisoft, our intention is to create games
[4703.54s -> 4707.94s]  that will make you stronger and happier in your life.
[4708.91s -> 4710.43s]  When you play Ubisoft games...
[4711.39s -> 4713.15s]  Get back in the Gamer Cube.
[4713.15s -> 4715.71s]  Spend quality time with family and friends...
[4715.71s -> 4716.59s]  I just need to stretch.
[4716.59s -> 4718.51s]  And meet new inspiring people.
[4719.55s -> 4721.47s]  Learn more about yourself by doing.
[4722.51s -> 4723.23s]  And gain new perspective on the world...
[4723.23s -> 4724.91s]  I just turned off my fucking PlayStation 4.
[4724.91s -> 4726.27s]  And help shape it.
[4727.07s -> 4731.15s]  So to everyone who plays our games,
[4731.87s -> 4732.91s]  thank you for your love.
[4733.95s -> 4740.37s]  Some of those games look pretty fun.
[4740.37s -> 4741.33s]  They did.
[4741.33s -> 4743.65s]  The new Watch Dogs looks actually good.
[4743.65s -> 4744.53s]  Looks fun to play.
[4744.53s -> 4747.25s]  Wish us to always do better and go further.
[4748.53s -> 4752.53s]  So now I'm very proud to announce a new project
[4752.53s -> 4755.01s]  from an exceptional team in Quebec City.
[4755.81s -> 4761.57s]  Please give a warm upload to Marc-Alessi Coté
[4761.57s -> 4764.61s]  who is coming to show you a sneak peek of his game.
[4766.05s -> 4773.02s]  I mean, if it's another Rayman, then that's a huge hit.
[4773.02s -> 4778.22s]  Thank you, everybody.
[4779.23s -> 4781.07s]  Over the last 10 years,
[4781.07s -> 4784.67s]  I've had the chance to be part of an incredible team
[4784.67s -> 4788.59s]  that has always pushed the limits of Assassin's Creed
[4788.59s -> 4791.23s]  and shown us different periods of our past.
[4792.51s -> 4796.56s]  But our imagination has always been bound
[4796.56s -> 4799.12s]  to the reality of the history books.
[4800.32s -> 4803.52s]  These past four years are minds I've lingered
[4803.52s -> 4806.32s]  on a different aspect of our history.
[4806.96s -> 4807.76s]  The mythology.
[4808.72s -> 4811.04s]  The stories of the ancient gods
[4811.04s -> 4813.68s]  and their misadventures have existed
[4813.68s -> 4817.44s]  through generations of storytellers and audiences
[4817.44s -> 4819.76s]  and have transformed into tales
[4819.76s -> 4823.20s]  that we still know and love today.
[4823.84s -> 4828.24s]  And now these stories have shaped our dreams,
[4828.80s -> 4831.36s]  inspiring us to build something new,
[4831.36s -> 4833.44s]  something that transcends the limits
[4833.44s -> 4836.08s]  that we have always set upon ourselves.
[4836.96s -> 4840.32s]  Today, I'm very proud to have the chance
[4840.32s -> 4843.12s]  to show you a glimpse, to show you a teaser
[4843.12s -> 4845.84s]  of this brand new game that we've been working on.
[4846.48s -> 4847.92s]  I hope you enjoy it.
[4847.92s -> 4849.68s]  Thank you and have a great E3.
[4910.96s -> 4912.08s]  Hello, everybody.
[4913.12s -> 4913.92s]  We didn't get that was.
[4916.96s -> 4918.08s]  Hello, everybody at home.
[4918.08s -> 4920.16s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[4920.16s -> 4923.60s]  I hope you had a great show, but this is just the beginning,
[4923.60s -> 4923.84s]  guys.
[4923.84s -> 4924.96s]  This is just the beginning.
[4925.60s -> 4926.00s]  Thank you.
[4926.00s -> 4926.48s]  Thank you.
[4926.48s -> 4926.96s]  Thank you.
[4928.48s -> 4929.92s]  This is just the beginning.
[4929.92s -> 4932.56s]  We are here outside of the Orpheum Theater
[4932.56s -> 4935.76s]  live from the pro zone where we have an incredible
[4935.76s -> 4938.56s]  Rainbow Six Siege show match together with.
[4938.56s -> 4939.52s]  That was a weird transition.
[4939.68s -> 4942.72s]  We have our two new best friends, T-Pain and Lil Yachty.
[4942.72s -> 4944.00s]  That's all right.
[4944.00s -> 4945.92s]  I kind of don't even know anything about
[4945.92s -> 4946.88s]  what they were just talking about.
[4948.24s -> 4949.76s]  They were just talking about how.
[4950.72s -> 4952.56s]  This is like the biggest thing we've like ever done
[4952.56s -> 4954.64s]  is a new project from a new studio and.
[4955.84s -> 4957.31s]  Okay.
[4957.31s -> 4957.63s]  Okay.
[4957.63s -> 4960.19s]  It is like the trailer from the iPad app store.
[4960.19s -> 4961.63s]  And we're live again indeed.
[4961.63s -> 4964.91s]  So once again, a quick reminder, Operation Phantom
[4964.91s -> 4967.71s]  Sight will be available starting tomorrow.
[4968.27s -> 4969.63s]  Any Rainbow Six fans here?
[4970.27s -> 4971.55s]  We're live again.
[4971.55s -> 4972.91s]  Well, it never turned off.
[4972.91s -> 4973.95s]  I like that.
[4973.95s -> 4975.39s]  Now we are super proud.
[4975.39s -> 4977.55s]  Super happy to present to you the Twitch
[4977.55s -> 4980.27s]  Rivals Rainbow Six Siege Celebrity Showdown
[4980.27s -> 4981.15s]  for the first time.
[4981.15s -> 4982.83s]  I want to see who the celebrities are.
[4982.83s -> 4985.07s]  Many Rivals events to follow this year.
[4985.07s -> 4985.55s]  Turn it off.
[4985.55s -> 4985.79s]  Turn.
[4985.79s -> 4986.75s]  Wait, is this not allowed?
[4986.75s -> 4987.55s]  Well, I guess.
[4987.55s -> 4988.43s]  Is this in the terms?
[4988.43s -> 4989.55s]  At home and do you guys hear?
[4991.33s -> 4994.93s]  Also, we have, as mentioned, eight incredible
[4994.93s -> 4995.43s]  streamers.
[4996.13s -> 4997.89s]  We have eight of the best streamers from all
[4997.89s -> 4998.93s]  over the world.
[4998.93s -> 4999.65s]  No, it's not illegal.
[4999.65s -> 5001.01s]  Probably the best in the world.
[5001.01s -> 5001.49s]  Why not?
[5001.49s -> 5002.05s]  It's allowed.
[5002.05s -> 5002.45s]  It's allowed.
[5002.45s -> 5003.89s]  And two amazing team captains.
[5003.89s -> 5006.61s]  And a quick thank you to our sponsors,
[5006.61s -> 5007.09s]  to our partners.
[5007.09s -> 5007.81s]  That was all right.
[5007.81s -> 5009.33s]  For hooking us up with some of the gear
[5009.33s -> 5010.13s]  you see out here.
[5010.13s -> 5010.69s]  Thank you guys.
[5010.69s -> 5011.73s]  You're amazing.
[5011.73s -> 5014.45s]  The C3 is kind of one of those lull years.
[5014.45s -> 5016.53s]  Besides like the Microsoft console.
[5016.53s -> 5017.57s]  Watch Dogs 3 looks fun.
[5017.57s -> 5018.05s]  Teams.
[5018.77s -> 5020.21s]  Team number one.
[5020.21s -> 5021.09s]  Why am I not here?
[5021.73s -> 5022.85s]  Why was I not invited?
[5023.49s -> 5024.53s]  We got T-Pain.
[5025.33s -> 5026.37s]  I don't play.
[5026.37s -> 5026.93s]  Why would I?
[5026.93s -> 5029.01s]  I don't play Rainbow Six Siege.
[5029.01s -> 5031.89s]  We got the Russian badge of what's good.
[5031.89s -> 5034.13s]  It's like, hey, dude, why were you not
[5034.13s -> 5035.81s]  invited to the Star Wars premiere?
[5035.81s -> 5035.89s]  I feel good.
[5035.89s -> 5035.97s]  I feel good.
[5035.97s -> 5037.17s]  I'm slightly less bloated than.
[5037.17s -> 5038.18s]  I'm good.
[5038.18s -> 5039.38s]  I brought some friends.
[5039.38s -> 5040.34s]  I did bring some friends.
[5040.34s -> 5041.70s]  These are all the winners over here.
[5041.70s -> 5043.86s]  So, you know, that's just how that works.
[5043.86s -> 5046.18s]  So, you know, we got Yachty here.
[5046.18s -> 5047.22s]  I heard.
[5047.22s -> 5049.04s]  I had heard.
[5049.04s -> 5050.24s]  What's the first thing that came to mind
[5050.24s -> 5051.20s]  when you heard you were going to battle?
[5051.20s -> 5051.52s]  Why?
[5051.52s -> 5052.32s]  What's wrong with it?
[5052.32s -> 5052.88s]  You know, it's no big deal.
[5052.88s -> 5053.76s]  It's just like it's an extension of E3.
[5053.76s -> 5054.80s]  He was like, oh, he's going to be there too.
[5054.80s -> 5055.60s]  That'd be cool.
[5055.60s -> 5056.88s]  He can watch us win, I guess.
[5056.88s -> 5057.44s]  Oh, shit.
[5057.44s -> 5058.48s]  So you're going to win.
[5058.48s -> 5060.72s]  Am I going to watch the Rainbow Six Siege?
[5060.72s -> 5061.84s]  Yeah, sure enough.
[5061.84s -> 5062.24s]  All right.
[5062.24s -> 5063.36s]  So let's call.
[5063.36s -> 5064.48s]  Turn it off.
[5064.48s -> 5065.76s]  Turn it off.
[5065.76s -> 5066.48s]  Whoa.
[5066.48s -> 5067.44s]  Everybody make some noise for Yachty.
[5067.44s -> 5068.64s]  No, I'm going to watch this.
[5068.64s -> 5069.52s]  We're watching this.
[5069.52s -> 5070.88s]  But, like, at least I'm just.
[5070.88s -> 5072.16s]  We've got little Yachty.
[5072.16s -> 5080.56s]  Bikini body.
[5080.56s -> 5081.20s]  Oh, my god.
[5081.20s -> 5082.40s]  Everyone's freaking out.
[5083.36s -> 5084.00s]  Y'all good?
[5084.00s -> 5088.94s]  Well, why is this so such a conflict?
[5088.94s -> 5090.86s]  It's just not enough with the conflict.
[5091.74s -> 5093.42s]  Enough with the conflict.
[5093.42s -> 5093.98s]  You guys.
[5094.30s -> 5095.26s]  It's starting to get to you.
[5095.26s -> 5098.14s]  I heard that if NA win, it'd be the first thing they ever won.
[5098.14s -> 5098.94s]  So.
[5098.94s -> 5100.06s]  Oh, shit.
[5101.18s -> 5103.07s]  Any response to that?
[5103.07s -> 5104.43s]  You know, winning once is always great.
[5104.43s -> 5105.07s]  Don't big deal.
[5105.07s -> 5107.47s]  This is probably my first time winning anything at all ever.
[5107.47s -> 5108.35s]  So, you know.
[5108.35s -> 5111.95s]  But, you know, I'll take the one win over over 10,000 losses.
[5111.95s -> 5112.27s]  Guys.
[5116.03s -> 5120.96s]  I got nothing else to do today.
[5121.94s -> 5126.02s]  We have to burn four hours until the Square Enix concert.
[5126.58s -> 5131.63s]  The Square Enix fucking conference.
[5132.35s -> 5140.53s]  And I'm just kind of just sitting here.
[5142.29s -> 5145.25s]  Watch the stuff that I missed from the, what about PC?
[5145.97s -> 5146.91s]  Should we go pee?
[5146.91s -> 5148.03s]  You want to take a little piss break?
[5149.14s -> 5149.46s]  All right.
[5149.46s -> 5150.10s]  I'll tell you.
[5150.10s -> 5152.66s]  I got team who's on these teams.
[5153.60s -> 5155.12s]  I didn't, I didn't even see who was on the teams.
[5157.79s -> 5158.83s]  Roller Champions.
[5167.23s -> 5168.35s]  It's at 3 Pacific.
[5171.58s -> 5171.82s]  All right.
[5171.82s -> 5172.54s]  Well, let me go pee.
[5173.34s -> 5183.10s]  How do I turn you off?
[5183.10s -> 5183.34s]  Okay.
[5183.34s -> 5183.98s]  You're out.
[5183.98s -> 5184.38s]  All right.
[5184.38s -> 5184.94s]  I'll be right back.
[5185.74s -> 5186.30s]  I gotta pee.
[5187.20s -> 5188.00s]  Why is this tiny?
[5191.44s -> 5192.24s]  All right.
[5192.24s -> 5192.72s]  Go pee.
[5193.44s -> 5194.32s]  We'll come back.
[5194.32s -> 5196.00s]  We'll burn like a few hours somehow.
[5197.97s -> 5199.81s]  If I actually download Roller Champions,
[5201.70s -> 5203.86s]  five to six thousand people are going to leave.
[5203.86s -> 5205.78s]  You probably already, you probably are going to leave anyways
[5205.78s -> 5207.70s]  because you may have just been here for the conference.
[5210.72s -> 5211.76s]  Roller Champions.
[5212.48s -> 5218.53s]  That will be like a stock market crash straight into the ground.
[5218.53s -> 5218.85s]  We'll see.
[5218.85s -> 5219.73s]  I'll be right back.
