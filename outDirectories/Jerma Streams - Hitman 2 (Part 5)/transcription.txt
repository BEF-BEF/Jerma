[0.63s -> 8.47s]  I'm so sudden, somebody said. So sudden. What do you mean sudden? I've got a time frame.
[8.47s -> 18.12s]  And I'm here. I could show up at one o'clock. I could show up at 1.59. Or two. Or 2.15. Carrying
[18.12s -> 23.35s]  a bunch of fucking grocery bags. I might, yeah, I may have been late, but I've got groceries. I was
[23.35s -> 31.38s]  at the grocery store and I have all the groceries. Six or seven bags on each hand. Because I don't
[31.38s -> 38.55s]  know about you guys. I don't do multiple trips going back and forth from the car. You do all of
[38.55s -> 44.14s]  it. So you only have to do it once. Sure, it hurts a little and it's a little bit of pain,
[44.70s -> 62.74s]  but you get everything done. I'm so proud of that. One and done. Yeah, exactly. 700,000 bags of milk.
[65.69s -> 73.26s]  But hello, I've returned. I was back from TwitchCon a day or two ago, but didn't stream.
[74.22s -> 82.31s]  Had some other stuff to take care of. But we're back. For good. Not that we were gone for good
[82.31s -> 89.59s]  either. I saw people in the pre-stream chat. They said, you've got to tell us some stories.
[90.63s -> 102.02s]  Okay. You ready for some wild TwitchCon stories? How about this one? Whoa. So at the TwitchCon party.
[103.58s -> 110.14s]  Wow. Huge concert. People fucking partying in the front on the field. It was at Petco parks. It was
[110.14s -> 118.44s]  a huge thing. I sat behind home plate where there was nobody there. Me and like five or six people.
[118.44s -> 126.18s]  We just watched from like a mile away. Just kind of sitting there enjoying the concert.
[131.18s -> 137.45s]  No, somebody said people watching. No, we essentially were doing a helicopter tour.
[137.45s -> 146.55s]  That's how far away we were. Just sitting there. It was kind of nice. Did I have a toothpick? Yes,
[146.55s -> 153.54s]  I did. At some point. And I'm sure there's going to be lots of pictures that people have.
[155.10s -> 160.70s]  Yeah. This one in the chat. Yeah. That's what people are saying. How do you react to,
[160.70s -> 166.14s]  how you can react to in gigantic quotes? Look, I squished Jerma in Photoshop.
[169.46s -> 177.18s]  Let me see. How do we react to this? What the fuck? The fuck did you do to me? I'm not that small.
[177.98s -> 190.44s]  Is that what you wanted? This one isn't even trying. Look at the, look at the ceiling. They
[190.44s -> 196.60s]  actually just took the crop tool, grabbed from the top of the picture and then squished it down and
[196.60s -> 206.25s]  then stretched it. That was not even trying. What about the stain on my pants? Yeah. I saw the one
[206.25s -> 209.69s]  with somebody. I saw the piss one, the, the way somebody made it look like I pissed my pants.
[217.50s -> 221.94s]  You got, you guys are some, there's just so, there's so many fake pictures out there.
[223.86s -> 227.74s]  I don't even know which one is the real one. You know what I mean? When you, when you, okay,
[227.74s -> 233.66s]  when you take a picture and it gets circulated a million times and it's edited a million times
[234.62s -> 241.18s]  and you show one of those, you show them edit number 600,241, that person probably thinks
[241.18s -> 250.15s]  that edit is real. A case of point, somebody put a text on my shirt in one of those posts.
[251.03s -> 254.15s]  I didn't have text on my shirt and somebody said, why the fuck is he wearing that shirt?
[254.87s -> 263.54s]  It's like, I, I wasn't wearing that shirt is exactly what happened. Dude, what the, what,
[263.54s -> 274.94s]  what happened? Why did he piss his pants? No. No. How do we combat fake data is what I want to know
[275.58s -> 282.15s]  because it's all fun and games. It's all fun and games until it starts like world war three.
[286.34s -> 296.42s]  This is the future. Yeah. But no, TwitchCon was awesome. I had a great time. Met a lot
[296.42s -> 306.30s]  of people. It was fantastic. Lots of new stuff coming out of TwitchCon. Uh, the next projects
[306.30s -> 311.94s]  project is already being worked on and it always isn't going to be good this time.
[311.94s -> 315.78s]  I ain't going to give you any details, but just know that somewhere in, um,
[316.42s -> 320.34s]  somewhere in December, January ish, uh, you're going to get something else. And it's going to
[320.34s -> 327.38s]  be pretty fucking cool. That's all I've got to say. Cool. All right. Today we are going to play
[328.76s -> 332.84s]  Hitman Tuesday. I'll say we got caught off last time last week, so I'm going to play it.
[333.64s -> 341.30s]  We have to finish one of the missions. Uh, there's one more area and then I kind of,
[341.30s -> 353.50s]  I want to go back and do the first area again. It's untitled goose game. Community stream when
[353.50s -> 356.94s]  right? Okay. I said I was going to talk about that too. I will probably do the community stream.
[356.94s -> 361.50s]  I'm going to go three days in a row. So we're going to do today is going to be hitman tomorrow.
[361.50s -> 365.90s]  Something weird. Uh, something that I don't, I might, I might have to change games within
[365.90s -> 369.90s]  10 seconds or I'll be addicted for 10 hours. I don't know. I just know that it exists and I'm
[369.90s -> 377.18s]  going to try it. Uh, and then Friday, I'm going to try to compile all those images and all those
[377.18s -> 382.14s]  things for the community night on Friday. So the end of this week, that sounds like plan to me.
[387.45s -> 394.02s]  Oh, should I go to work? Well, I did say that I was going to do it right. Like kind of right
[394.02s -> 397.86s]  after TwitchCon, I was going to, we were going to do it. So I mean, TwitchCon was this last weekend,
[399.29s -> 406.10s]  but let's get started. Don't waste any more time. Let's play the second area and hitman two and
[406.10s -> 416.82s]  let's just enjoy hitman too. I mean, let's enjoy it because this is, this is probably going to be
[416.82s -> 424.31s]  the last time that I play this game. I can't imagine going back to doing more hitman too.
[424.31s -> 432.07s]  So let's get all we want out of it today. How's that sound? This one's called the last resort.
[432.07s -> 454.98s]  Why is everybody doing the D phase? I don't get it. Oh, it's because it's the, by the way,
[454.98s -> 458.50s]  all my other monitor is just that image of me. Like, and here's the thing about like,
[458.50s -> 462.58s]  here's the thing about like the fake. I can't even talk about a problem. I will in a minute.
[471.05s -> 478.84s]  I'm like spouting off about fake media, but it's true though. It's
[478.84s -> 481.80s]  actual fake media that's supposed to be presented as real.
[495.66s -> 503.74s]  out of the Maldives. It's true. It's fake. To the public, they specialize in reputation management
[503.74s -> 509.58s]  for the rich and famous. The real money, however, comes from the covert reconstruction of identities
[509.58s -> 517.34s]  for wealthy criminals. They make people disappear. The partners are using Haven to acquire new
[517.34s -> 524.78s]  identities. Yes, it's true that it's fake. This is going to get real weird in 10 years.
[526.68s -> 540.84s]  The access keys every 10 hours. That unfortunately makes them targets. It's called Haven is a true
[540.84s -> 547.32s]  tropical paradise owned by the company's founder, Tyson Williams. The island is used by Haven as
[547.32s -> 553.00s]  a combined headquarters and client entertainment center. Current and potential clients are ferried
[553.00s -> 558.12s]  to the island and treated to the very best. Do I get to drive a boat? I hope I can drive a boat.
[558.20s -> 560.12s]  That's the first thing I'm going to try. I don't care about anything else.
[577.53s -> 580.01s]  Boat client. You want a boat.
[583.77s -> 585.37s]  And he loves the water. He loves boats.
[592.89s -> 599.45s]  CEO of Haven. This guy, a former confidence artist hired by Williams to serve as a client
[599.45s -> 605.37s]  recruiter in hand. Okay. And Stephen Bradley, technical wizard and the brains behind Haven's
[605.37s -> 612.33s]  proprietary software. The owner's gone. Olivia will be able to penetrate the Haven servers long
[612.33s -> 619.29s]  enough for her to secure the new part. I've uploaded all the information we have on the
[619.29s -> 630.18s]  island and the three targets. Best of luck, gentlemen. Well, good luck. I don't do shit.
[631.61s -> 636.41s]  I just send you off and stand over here till you're done. But I'm a very, very,
[636.41s -> 647.80s]  I'm very good at assassinating people too. Where's the multiplayer? Come on,
[647.80s -> 666.90s]  with co-op for this mission. DLC co-op with that guy. All right. So we've got Jesus. Okay. So we
[666.90s -> 681.08s]  got Tyson Williams, Stephen Bradley, and Ludmila Vitrova. Let's go to the planning stage. Resort.
[681.08s -> 685.80s]  Okay. Coins. I was going to take a few coins. I would prefer apples, but I don't know. They're
[685.80s -> 688.60s]  not available. They better be available in this mission or I'll be very upset.
[691.58s -> 697.45s]  This guy's wearing welding glasses. Okay. Good to know. I think we're good. No, wait, wait, wait,
[697.45s -> 703.93s]  wait, wait. I got something better than this, right? Yeah. Looks good. All right. I'm ready.
[704.89s -> 712.87s]  And play unprofessional. We just got big bits just came in. Freddie Dredd just gave 5,000 bits.
[713.51s -> 718.47s]  Thank you, Freddie Dredd. I don't know how to use Twitch, but I love you,
[718.47s -> 726.41s]  Jerma. Made this account for you. Well, thank you, Freddie Dredd, that you figured it out.
[726.41s -> 728.81s]  I think you got it working. Welcome to the Maldives.
[731.05s -> 741.29s]  Appreciate that though. That's a lot of money. Thank you, Freddie Dredd. Made this account from
[741.29s -> 745.77s]  me. It's ready to receive you under your assumed identity as Tobias Reaper,
[745.77s -> 751.37s]  a professional thief looking to retire from a life of crime. Freddie Dredd watches Jerma.
[751.37s -> 756.49s]  Ludmilla Vetrova can be found in the public section of the island, primarily tending to
[756.49s -> 761.93s]  client needs. Is this some kind of currency thing? Steven Bradley alternates between looking after
[761.93s -> 766.57s]  a strict training regimen. I also made this account for you. How many of you guys made your
[766.57s -> 772.17s]  account last night? While Tyson Williams roams his large villa estate at the back of the island.
[773.54s -> 778.50s]  Why did you just put on extra glasses? Eliminating the three owners of Haven
[778.50s -> 782.58s]  should buy Miss Hall the time needed to do a full penetration and retrieval
[782.58s -> 785.70s]  of the Providence partner. Providence partner data is what I need.
[787.46s -> 797.22s]  I told I get to drive a boat. I knew it. I didn't, but he did. Jealous. Jealous.
[804.98s -> 820.81s]  Damn it. Okay. Did I take the bag? All right. I got to, okay, hold on. God damn it. I wish I
[820.81s -> 831.50s]  could fly one of those. All right. So we just get up here. This is a nice place. A little chunky.
[831.50s -> 842.46s]  It's a little chunky right now because my computer sucks. I need like a 2080.
[845.02s -> 847.90s]  I thought that guy was pissing. All right. So we have to look for some intel.
[848.62s -> 851.93s]  Let me look at the map. So we write what there's one right here.
[852.89s -> 857.43s]  Easy. I need to get a better computer. I know I do.
[863.08s -> 868.42s]  Is this open? No. Anything in there? I don't know. All right. Let's go to the welcome center.
[869.06s -> 871.86s]  I think the welcome center is over here. Let's go through the front door.
[872.50s -> 884.39s]  My shadow is messed up. Yeah. Well, that's what a 1080 gets you.
[888.95s -> 895.27s]  Okay. Key to the private hut. Welcome to Haven. Let's do it. What do you guys got for me?
[898.49s -> 911.30s]  Personal message. All right. Can I get a candy? No, I can't take a peppermint.
[912.02s -> 920.87s]  So the key to your personal hut. Where the hell is my, where is it? I hate when hotels do this
[920.87s -> 927.34s]  shit. They just hand you your key. They don't even tell you where the elevator is. Here you go, Mr.
[927.34s -> 932.68s]  Albertson. Have a nice day. You're on like the 54th floor. You don't know. I don't know where the
[932.68s -> 939.64s]  fuck to go. Did she tell me? She told me. What did she say? Hold on. She said it?
[943.62s -> 953.75s]  Hut on the left? Hold on. Wait. Did she actually say it? He just wanted to talk shit. Wait. I don't
[953.75s -> 960.62s]  care about that. We don't go right to your hotel room. Anyway, you go to the bar first. This is
[960.62s -> 987.78s]  water. This is cool. I was too invested in the candy. Oh my God. Are these pretzels? Okay.
[989.34s -> 998.73s]  Selling off. Wait. Oh, you two aren't talking.
[1012.25s -> 1017.26s]  I'm just eavesdropping on the wrong people. Okay, you're selling it. All right.
[1017.26s -> 1022.06s]  It seems Ms. Ventrova is trying to get Jason Portman out of his hut and she has ordered a
[1022.06s -> 1026.22s]  member of staff to watch him. According to his entourage, he's planning on selling his shares in
[1026.22s -> 1049.66s]  his company, Much Talk to Haven. Can I? I want to get on this. Maybe she'll think it's a real alligator.
[1049.66s -> 1059.26s]  Look out behind you. Holy shit. I don't know what that was. What she made out of. What are you made
[1059.26s -> 1067.99s]  out of? No, it was intel.
[1092.82s -> 1093.14s]  Okay.
[1103.37s -> 1116.15s]  I keep thinking of the alligator. That's not cool. All right. Okay. I need to go to my hut.
[1116.87s -> 1122.25s]  Can I go back to the front desk? Excuse me. Where did you say it was again?
[1122.89s -> 1128.58s]  I just, I forget. I know you had candy up here and that was a mistake. Get that out of here.
[1128.58s -> 1134.04s]  You're distracting all of us squirrel people. Was it this way or to the right?
[1138.55s -> 1155.54s]  Behind you on the right. Right over here. Okay. Do I have to get searched?
[1164.33s -> 1168.65s]  Listen to me. You will get that whole fucking container of peppermint candies
[1168.65s -> 1174.02s]  and you bring that fucking whole container over here. Okay. You do that. There's a $50 bill
[1174.74s -> 1189.80s]  with your name on it. I want that. I want that whole fucking container. Make something up. I
[1189.80s -> 1198.31s]  don't care. All right. There's a message for me in here. Intel. A pamphlet describing the various
[1198.31s -> 1203.54s]  activities available to clients visiting Haven Island. The island offers massage facilities,
[1203.54s -> 1208.42s]  a full gym, yoga lessons, private huts, a fully stocked cocktail bar and a five-star restaurant.
[1208.90s -> 1218.06s]  Pretty cool. Can I just like, can I just do this? Can I just enjoy the resort? What if I don't want
[1218.06s -> 1231.93s]  to do anything? This is awesome. I wonder how much this is a night. This is probably like
[1231.93s -> 1243.98s]  2,500 bucks a night. Oh, there we go. All right. Call this number. A note from Ludmilla Vitrova.
[1243.98s -> 1249.10s]  I wonder what she wants from you 47. Regardless, it would be a shame to keep her waiting.
[1249.82s -> 1258.97s]  All right. So I have to call Vitrova. All right. Let's call her. Don't ever fucking leave without
[1258.97s -> 1265.66s]  one of these. You didn't think there was going to be apples in this trip, did you?
[1266.94s -> 1288.92s]  Well, there are. I wish there was three. Come on. Come on. Yeah, I thought about it. Wait,
[1288.92s -> 1323.54s]  can I get that? No, get down. Oh my God. You idiot. Hold on. Save the game. I got to have a
[1323.54s -> 1330.34s]  point where a nice save slot. Okay, there's that one. I don't remember what any of these do.
[1330.34s -> 1342.50s]  I'm going to go over here. No, I can't ride it. Wait a minute. Was that the guy? I think that was
[1342.50s -> 1350.04s]  the actual guy. Is this the guy that I need to get rid of? All right. Let's go call Vitrova on
[1350.04s -> 1364.92s]  phone. What's with all the water everywhere? Well, the point, it's the ocean. What are you talking
[1364.92s -> 1372.46s]  about? What is this? Is this a shaver? You got to be careful with these things. I talked a lot about
[1373.10s -> 1380.73s]  these things are dangerous. All right. Overflow the sink in my own apartment.
[1380.73s -> 1384.41s]  No, no. Turn that off. Turn that off. I don't want to do that. This is a nice place. Shit. It's okay.
[1384.41s -> 1410.14s]  Can I take a bath? No. Where did that go? Okay. It's fine. There's a big dent in it, but it's
[1410.14s -> 1433.38s]  all right. Let's make the call. I can't do it. I'm going to practice this. Hey, Vitrova. I met you
[1433.38s -> 1442.55s]  at the bar and I want to say, I think we hit it off. No, I can't do it. Okay, good. I can do it.
[1442.55s -> 1466.92s]  What's going on? Vitrova, it's Tobias Reaper. I really wasn't nervous. I reviewed your file prior
[1466.92s -> 1474.78s]  to your arrival and it's very intriguing. An offer. If you're interested, you can find me over at the
[1474.78s -> 1485.88s]  restaurant. I'll keep it in line. Go to the restaurant and she has an offer. Meet Vitrova
[1485.88s -> 1498.36s]  at the restaurant as Mr. Reaper. Do I get new clothes? No, I don't have any new clothes. Why
[1498.36s -> 1509.96s]  did I do this stupid outfit? Two big butterflies. That's a nice touch. Okay. Nothing else in here.
[1509.96s -> 1517.90s]  All right. Let's meet. What? What do you mean remove safety pin for the trap door?
[1518.46s -> 1536.44s]  Oh, am I going to 1980s cartoon villain somebody down here? All right. Should I? I just want to
[1536.44s -> 1548.60s]  see what it does. Oh shit. All right. It's ice fishing. Stand on it. I can't stand on it. Get
[1548.60s -> 1563.45s]  in there. Hold on. Can I be like a trap door spider and just pull somebody in? No, I don't think I
[1563.45s -> 1571.86s]  want to do that. I think that's just a, I think I don't know. Maybe I dropped somebody. All right.
[1571.86s -> 1582.90s]  I gotta go to the restaurant. Let's go. Let's keep it moving. Restaurants this way. That's the toilet.
[1584.87s -> 1598.18s]  You know, I, for a tenth of a second, I believed. What do you mean trespassing? Trespassing?
[1599.18s -> 1608.28s]  We don't share this whole thing. Let's get this private hut. Yeah. The inside. This is,
[1608.28s -> 1621.66s]  I'm not allowed to be over here. Jeremy, this is a hotel. Yeah. But it's an outdoor hotel. I've never
[1621.66s -> 1628.36s]  been in one of these before. Sorry guys. I don't have any experiences in a fucking $4,000 a night
[1628.36s -> 1646.66s]  outdoor cabana place. Quick. I gotta get in there and dance. I had fun too.
[1646.66s -> 1670.65s]  How do you dance? No, not subdue. Dance. Let's go right here. No. Order a drink?
[1674.41s -> 1677.13s]  Why would you poison something in front of everybody? All right. I don't think I can do
[1677.13s -> 1689.61s]  anything here. All right. Let's go to the restaurant. Guys playing chess. Can I play chess?
[1690.25s -> 1694.71s]  Playing chess by yourself. Isn't that how you learn? That's how you get to be like next level,
[1694.71s -> 1712.09s]  right? You try to beat yourself. Okay. Yeah. You play chess against yourself. So then you
[1712.09s -> 1719.77s]  always have a move because you know you made it. And then you just gridlock yourself until you win,
[1719.77s -> 1721.93s]  until one of your brains wins. All right. Let's have the meeting.
[1722.73s -> 1728.79s]  Mr. Reaper. So good to see you. Good to see you too. What do you want to talk about? Should I sit
[1728.79s -> 1737.16s]  down? No. Let's talk. You mentioned an offer. Yes. It's a little embarrassing, but we've had an
[1737.16s -> 1744.55s]  incident. A theft. A thief is an employee here. A person working in Mr. Williams's villa at the
[1744.55s -> 1750.87s]  other end of the island. What was stolen? A USB drive containing some sensitive information.
[1751.75s -> 1755.83s]  Personal information, which I would rather not fall into the hands of others.
[1755.83s -> 1762.55s]  Okay. So my offer is this. Obtain the USB drive from the thief without alerting anyone
[1762.55s -> 1768.55s]  at the villa. The thief is likely still there. I can't get you inside, so you'll have to use
[1768.55s -> 1778.25s]  that particular skill set of yours. Two targets remaining. The trover has been permanently
[1779.13s -> 1805.50s]  detained. What the hell was that? Oh, it's another one of these.
[1806.70s -> 1812.76s]  She said particular skill set and I had to do it. I don't even talk. What do you mean whiny?
[1830.28s -> 1839.67s]  I love this game so much. These games are so fucking good. They really are. Just like so.
[1840.65s -> 1847.21s]  This is so ridiculous. I love it. Sometimes you forget just how much fun you're gonna have in
[1847.21s -> 1858.94s]  just being a dickhead in these games. Well, now we have to listen to that again. All right,
[1858.94s -> 1873.86s]  so I have to infiltrate. Mr. Reaper. It's very good to meet you. I'm not gonna do it again.
[1873.86s -> 1881.43s]  You mentioned an offer. Yes. It's a little embarrassing, but we've had an incident. A theft.
[1881.43s -> 1887.32s]  A thief is an employee here. A person working in Mr. Williams's villa at the other end of the
[1887.40s -> 1895.42s]  island. What was stolen? A USB drive containing... Get the USB drive. Personal information,
[1895.42s -> 1903.96s]  which I would rather not fall into the hands of others. So my offer is this. Obtain the USB
[1903.96s -> 1914.98s]  drive from the thief without alerting anyone at the villa. The thief is likely still there.
[1916.02s -> 1920.02s]  I can't get you inside, so you'll have to use that particular skill set of yours to gain...
[1920.82s -> 1925.90s]  No! I wanted to do the apple! I thought I was gonna do the apple.
[1931.66s -> 1936.38s]  Why would I have a melee item equipped? I was gonna hit apples in the face,
[1936.38s -> 1944.09s]  now I just punched her in the face. What do you mean try again? No. You want me to be stuck here
[1944.09s -> 1960.10s]  for like 45 minutes? Uh-uh. Did it break the game? The next four hours of the stream is gonna be
[1960.18s -> 2007.21s]  this. This is what we pay you for. What about that plan again? Tell me more about that plan.
[2007.93s -> 2015.26s]  Command? Yeah. It was nothing. It's very personal. Please call me as soon as you've recovered it.
[2015.26s -> 2019.90s]  I'm sorry. I just was hit in the face by an apple.
[2020.46s -> 2023.80s]  It's taken me months to prepare this, and I've been very careful.
[2023.80s -> 2026.92s]  We're gonna watch everybody here get fired. I'm really looking through my computer right now.
[2036.14s -> 2039.58s]  Okay. Do I have to walk with her? All right. Infiltrate the villa.
[2039.58s -> 2045.30s]  Good afternoon, sir. I think this is fucked up.
[2045.30s -> 2046.34s]  The accounts are in place.
[2057.05s -> 2062.01s]  To be fair, that hit her square in the face. It was not like in the back of the head.
[2062.57s -> 2067.43s]  That was just right in the face. How come I can't pick up these?
[2072.44s -> 2082.02s]  Yeah. I wonder how many teeth I knocked out. And I got it back. Just gotta rub it off a little.
[2082.10s -> 2090.07s]  No big deal. Oh, I just pressed the DPI button. All right. So let's infiltrate the villa.
[2090.71s -> 2098.09s]  So that puts us... Okay. Look at how menacing this thumbnail is.
[2103.03s -> 2107.62s]  Eat the apple? No, I need this. This is important. All right. Let's see.
[2108.71s -> 2116.57s]  So I got to infiltrate the villa, which is down here. I can't vault over this?
[2116.57s -> 2120.41s]  All right. We've got to go down this way. Wait, there might be more apples in here.
[2123.70s -> 2127.30s]  Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs and Clown Daddy. Both of you.
[2127.30s -> 2132.04s]  Thanks for the five community subs from each of you. Oh, soda can. Perfect.
[2132.60s -> 2138.07s]  What is this? ATM? Ice machine? No. Oh, actually, I probably...
[2138.79s -> 2145.78s]  Am I gonna stab himself in the face? All right. I think I'm gonna turn on...
[2145.78s -> 2161.90s]  I'm gonna get the chef outfit. I think that'll help. All right. Let me get out the...
[2163.02s -> 2193.27s]  No, I'm just gonna knock him out. Turn this off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!
[2193.27s -> 2199.67s]  Turn it off! Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no. That's bad.
[2223.59s -> 2225.19s]  No, god damn it.
[2230.58s -> 2234.66s]  Fuck. It's too condensed. It's... All right. It's way too condensed.
[2235.22s -> 2239.38s]  Where was it? 1340. I can do it. It's gonna be quieter than that.
[2243.58s -> 2248.50s]  Lead pipe. The game is quiet. I'll fix that. Just give me one sec.
[2249.14s -> 2259.90s]  There you go. That should be better. All right. I gotta become a chef.
[2262.60s -> 2267.98s]  I think it's... The apple is not silent, by the way. It's very loud.
[2269.46s -> 2273.94s]  Everything is loud. So I need... Where's my iPod? All right. The iPod will work.
[2276.15s -> 2279.74s]  Let's get the chef to come in here. He'll figure it out.
[2280.78s -> 2291.82s]  I'm gonna get behind him. I'm gonna close the door.
[2304.09s -> 2308.73s]  This doesn't kill him, right? Oh, I killed him. I killed him with the fucking iPod.
[2320.49s -> 2325.53s]  All right. Well, that's unfortunate because I really did not want to kill that guy.
[2326.17s -> 2331.78s]  By the way, I feel like the iPod would break. I feel like these earphones would just
[2331.78s -> 2337.42s]  snap and it wouldn't kill the guy. Whatever. Does he know? Does he know that I'm not him?
[2340.04s -> 2341.96s]  Oh, meat bone. Nice.
[2358.47s -> 2363.51s]  What's going on? Well, I'm turning the stoves on. I'm a chef.
[2363.51s -> 2389.18s]  I turned on the stove. Damn it. And I didn't fucking save it. Oh my God. I'm too... I'm too
[2389.18s -> 2409.78s]  ADD in this game. I was there. I turned the stove on. Why is that so out of the ordinary?
[2409.78s -> 2436.04s]  Wait a minute. The chef just turned on the stove. Let's all fucking run. What? Oh, I don't want to
[2436.04s -> 2450.46s]  kill him. I just want to knock him out. Whatever. I don't know about this. I don't know about this
[2450.46s -> 2466.87s]  guy. Well, I turned on all the stoves, but who cares? What if I had a big dinner service? I love
[2466.87s -> 2473.35s]  how turning a stove on as a chef is more suspicious than hiding and throwing an apple at the target
[2474.50s -> 2488.01s]  in plain sight. Save the game. Let's do this one here. This guy was destined to die. No. All right.
[2488.65s -> 2496.02s]  Don't turn the stove on, but I do want the meaty bone. Plate this up. I'll make it unforgettable,
[2496.02s -> 2501.70s]  chef. I need poison. Oh, this is awesome. Poison. Poison. Poison. What do we got? Poison.
[2502.42s -> 2509.88s]  I need poison first. Where's poison?
[2509.88s -> 2515.13s]  Anyway, we also need to find a good way. I had some in Copenhagen a few months back and they're
[2515.13s -> 2521.93s]  just perfectly tangy in the city. A real treat. Like mighty down on an overripe orange. We go
[2521.93s -> 2527.19s]  great with the sauteed chinoise and soy garlic. I'm trying to put it up there.
[2531.58s -> 2535.50s]  All right. Just put it. Okay. I'm done with that. Where's the pot? Wait. Hey,
[2536.54s -> 2545.74s]  hey, Mike. Where's the poison? Where do we keep it? Start a gas leak. Cheeseburger. Oh, yeah.
[2548.04s -> 2559.42s]  Cheeseburger. Nice. All right. Blend in as a waiter. Why do I need to do that?
[2559.98s -> 2568.15s]  I must remember to grab one. Okay. I gotta put this down. What is it? J? How do you drop something?
[2568.15s -> 2575.56s]  G? Z. Okay. Hey, mister. I think you dropped that. Yeah, I know. I did. All right. I need to get
[2575.56s -> 2585.38s]  poison. Perfect. Where can I get poison? Don't touch that. Leave that there.
[2597.82s -> 2606.02s]  What about over here? No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't. Don't. Is he taking it out?
[2608.02s -> 2625.26s]  Mr. Trova. No shit. Okay. It's perfect. Perfect. Come on. Christ sakes. All right. Poison. Quick.
[2625.98s -> 2636.79s]  Where can I get some poison? Some hut or some? Where's like the basement? I need like a chemical
[2636.79s -> 2666.94s]  basement. Is this poison factory? Staff key. Got it. Save it. Poison. No. I'm gonna shoot myself.
[2667.42s -> 2674.60s]  I had to just walk away and I swear he didn't even notice. He just kept on talking.
[2676.31s -> 2681.72s]  On a different sub. Let me take this off of him. A little too strong,
[2681.72s -> 2689.22s]  mister. Let me get. Let me take this off your hands. Let me help you. Let me help you. Get out
[2689.22s -> 2695.66s]  of the way. I'm trying to help you. Get away from me, you creep. It's my turn to do the dishes. When
[2695.66s -> 2705.51s]  have you ever heard something like this? Check up on stock with the key back. Whatever. Yeah. I got
[2705.51s -> 2718.50s]  the key. Oh, am I allowed to be back here? Oh, that's right. I'm a chef now. Okay. What about
[2718.50s -> 2729.86s]  the old man? Poison. Poison. No, it's just soda. It could be poison though. It is poison. If we're
[2729.86s -> 2765.90s]  talking real life. Am I right, guys? That's funny. All right. I'm getting too distracted.
[2768.18s -> 2771.22s]  I really am. There's so many things to do here. There's so many places to be.
[2773.16s -> 2778.52s]  I'm too distracted. I gotta, I gotta focus hard. Is it ready yet? Please don't tell me you're trying
[2778.52s -> 2785.72s]  to put ants back on the menu. Nobody liked the ants. It's not ready. So here we are. I really hope
[2785.72s -> 2802.49s]  you like this one because yeah, that would be nice. I missed it. Wait, she's coming in. Sir,
[2803.59s -> 2810.98s]  your breath stinks. Back off. Okay. I'm rather speechless here. Um, let's pretend I didn't taste
[2810.98s -> 2815.46s]  it. I'll come back. You try again. You didn't even get it. That was a garnish.
[2816.90s -> 2830.90s]  You didn't touch the cheeseburger. Okay, here we go again. All right. Looks good.
[2832.36s -> 2840.12s]  Oh, that reminds me, I did some experimentation. Your breath stinks. Wait, revolt.
[2840.28s -> 2844.52s]  Once that's done, we skin them, slice them thin and ferment them with poison.
[2844.52s -> 2854.86s]  But I stopped getting distracted. I need poison. Why would you be upset about extra food there?
[2876.15s -> 2884.55s]  Well, go, go, go, go. Yeah, I kind of do.
[2924.76s -> 2941.18s]  Imagine waking up to this. Why me? Why me? Free drinks. Poison. Where was the poison?
[2941.18s -> 2986.07s]  Somebody said poison. No, it was an accident. I need poison quickly. That was insane.
[2987.43s -> 3012.17s]  Oh, that's just mean. Hold on. That was mean. I'm going back. Where was it? You know how hard it is
[3012.17s -> 3018.57s]  for me to play these games. Some of you guys can be very, very tactical and very precise.
[3019.29s -> 3023.61s]  That's awesome. But if there's an interaction, like for instance, like I'm just going to pick
[3023.61s -> 3029.62s]  this up. I kind of have to. I have to pick this up. There was an internal struggle in my head
[3029.62s -> 3032.82s]  right there. Don't pick that up. It doesn't matter. I had to pick this up. I had to.
[3036.94s -> 3045.80s]  I'm watching the stream right now. I'm not participating. You and I are in the same boat.
[3046.95s -> 3052.70s]  My hands have taken over. I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[3052.70s -> 3063.67s]  I don't know what he's going to do next. What? That wasn't that big of a deal.
[3064.81s -> 3076.28s]  Is this over here of a trash can? If I'm this person, that's... Get rid of it. I'll take care
[3076.28s -> 3109.59s]  of it. I'm going to save everybody. Hold on. I'm going to rescue us. What? You've all been
[3109.59s -> 3120.06s]  rescued. Congratulations. How did nobody give a shit about that? Wait, sand castle.
[3126.71s -> 3132.68s]  Wait, can I... What? Let me help. This is a beautiful sand castle.
[3135.16s -> 3143.05s]  Does anyone know this dickhead? Has anyone seen him before? Oh, sorry.
[3145.69s -> 3149.77s]  What do you think you're doing, buddy? I'm done with you. I'm getting out right now.
[3152.09s -> 3168.30s]  I'm never going to get to the end of this mission. I'm sorry. Some guy walks over to
[3168.30s -> 3172.06s]  you sand castle and just ruins it with... He puts a big chunk of meat in there.
[3172.70s -> 3192.76s]  Did you just get threatened by a gun over a sand castle? Yes. Don't do too much. Hey, good to see
[3193.00s -> 3201.66s]  you. Good to see you. Okay. What was I doing? Right. I need to get poison. We have to poison
[3201.66s -> 3210.07s]  the thing. Right? What the hell was I doing? Yeah. Poison. I'm walking by. Don't... Why? I'm
[3210.07s -> 3240.23s]  walking by. I'm just walking by. What the fuck are you doing? Okay. Don't walk by that guy.
[3240.23s -> 3259.75s]  I can't cover. I know. I know. I didn't think. Okay. Don't. Easy. There's a guy right there.
[3260.39s -> 3267.70s]  Just let me look at the... Let me look at the menu. So I need to go. We need to go over here. So I
[3267.70s -> 3274.02s]  just got to turn around. Just make my way this way through here. If I come across poison, I can
[3274.02s -> 3280.87s]  bring it back. That sounds like a plan. All right. Good. Down this way. Watch out for the guys that
[3280.87s -> 3292.44s]  know who I am. So I have a couple of choices here. Go infiltrate the villa or find poison. I think
[3292.44s -> 3304.38s]  find poison is number one. I may actually be able to get poisoned there. All right. I might be able
[3304.38s -> 3318.10s]  to just get in as the chef. Okay. We're good. I can go through here. Right. They're not going to
[3318.10s -> 3324.58s]  search me, are they? No, I can't. I'm not going over there. I know I'm not supposed to be over
[3324.58s -> 3328.46s]  there. That's fine. What about in here? What the hell is this?
[3347.30s -> 3350.98s]  All right. So I got to do that. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I need
[3350.98s -> 3363.74s]  to... Well, I can't poison her then. Don't poison her. Go to... Oh, fuck. I'm trespassing.
[3369.16s -> 3391.62s]  Poison. Oh, no. I'm in trouble. Oh, God. Oh, my God. What the hell happened? Oh, fuck. I'm in
[3391.62s -> 3402.17s]  trouble. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got it. Say, why? Oh, Mr. You're currently

[10413.43s -> 10419.32s]  what i listen this is i swear to god what happened was
[10419.32s -> 10424.20s]  i fucking pressed x instead of space because i'm just rushing through it
[10424.20s -> 10430.28s]  i pressed x i climb up instead of like just fall down
[10430.28s -> 10441.19s]  god damn it i'm so sorry this is the last time this is gonna happen
[10441.19s -> 10451.26s]  oh i'm getting texted i'm getting texts who is it
[10451.26s -> 10470.38s]  i'm sure everything is all set to go you can get levels from the first hitman
[10470.38s -> 10477.70s]  what do you mean don't fuck this up he did do not fuck it up stay right
[10477.70s -> 10480.74s]  here don't touch anything he's apparently gotta do his doctor
[10481.30s -> 10484.66s]  and i'm saying it with some patient called tyson williams over at this big
[10484.66s -> 10488.66s]  villa on the other end of the island on the other end of the island i can't
[10488.66s -> 10492.34s]  believe i'm saying tyson williams has summoned a doctor
[10492.34s -> 10518.12s]  it's so we never have to see that again
[10531.19s -> 10545.34s]  this is a hard crash too the whole thing turns oh shit god damn it okay um
[10545.34s -> 10558.25s]  i want to play this mission please wait it's this a there's a patch i'm
[10558.25s -> 10564.26s]  downloading a patch right now for hitman 2 i think i just got
[10564.26s -> 10575.99s]  crash booted out to download a hotfix or is this a cloud this is my yeah this
[10575.99s -> 10591.51s]  is the cloud sync oh okay well that makes sense then hitman
[10591.51s -> 10597.93s]  three oh by the way i've had that germa
[10597.93s -> 10602.41s]  985 is squashed into like four feet tall image on the right monitor the whole
[10602.41s -> 10605.59s]  time i just can't i have an alt tab and close
[10605.59s -> 10614.06s]  it it's still over there was i just destined to not play this
[10614.06s -> 10616.22s]  mission this kind of story here i think it's
[10616.22s -> 10620.76s]  possible show it i don't need to show it you guys
[10620.76s -> 10624.12s]  know the one i'm talking about i could be describing 500 different
[10624.12s -> 10639.24s]  pictures by the way no we don't no we don't no we don't yes you do
[10639.24s -> 10644.06s]  yes you do do the challenge instead of the story mission
[10644.06s -> 10653.66s]  yeah that's a good idea so let's go to uh we have escalation is it game modes
[10653.66s -> 10659.29s]  no no this is wait no destinations okay let's go to
[10659.29s -> 10670.82s]  uh heaven island and then challenges the last made the last resort so i just
[10670.82s -> 10679.51s]  i pick one of these aren't there other missions inside of
[10679.51s -> 10683.35s]  these though or is this the i remember the other ones had
[10683.35s -> 10709.86s]  um other stuff is it escalations the hell is this sniper assassin new
[10709.86s -> 10714.38s]  content haven island no i already have it is that it's just
[10714.38s -> 10716.62s]  different targets yeah i've thought there was
[10716.62s -> 10732.33s]  i remember from the base game contracts trending elusive target the captain
[10732.33s -> 10747.91s]  should we go for the captain let's try it good morning 47 target is
[10747.91s -> 10751.35s]  ruthaford a captain who works at haven resort the owner tyson williams has
[10751.35s -> 10755.11s]  contracted us that he wants ruthaford dead for causing many accidents at the
[10755.11s -> 10773.18s]  resort including sinking boats okay just yeah why does
[10773.18s -> 10779.82s]  why can't you just fire him that doesn't i don't understand
[10779.82s -> 10788.95s]  flash phone what does this do oh that sounds cool
[10788.95s -> 10808.46s]  all right let's get him captain ruthaford ruthaford ruthaford all right
[10808.46s -> 10820.09s]  eliminate captain ruthaford so you can make a contract for this guy mr reaper
[10820.09s -> 10831.45s]  that's pretty cool eliminate the captain all right the captain's in here
[10831.45s -> 10836.73s]  upstairs i wonder how difficult this is going to be
[10836.73s -> 10847.10s]  go just go in there and just poison them this is not going to be this easy is it
[10847.10s -> 10853.67s]  i think i just did it i went i think right
[10853.67s -> 10882.50s]  hey so i just i just have to dump the guy and listen to the story okay
[10882.50s -> 10890.95s]  is there an actual story they're all easy to do it like this
[10890.95s -> 10911.82s]  all right let's go so i'm gonna say i'm gonna tail him for a little while
[10911.82s -> 10931.40s]  so he does he's up here drinking comes out here this way and then
[10931.40s -> 10936.76s]  we're gonna listen to what he has to say
[10943.94s -> 10952.42s]  soon as i find the rest of this here treasure map treasure
[10952.42s -> 10959.64s]  will be mine that means it's probably a treasure easter egg on the island
[10959.64s -> 10963.64s]  right i would think so back off a little buddy
[10963.64s -> 10976.46s]  you're starting to freak me out does he only stay up here
[10976.46s -> 10990.52s]  hey buddy how you doing well it's poison is the easiest thing
[10990.52s -> 10993.88s]  well at least the one that's the most i'm trespassing i know
[10993.88s -> 11009.06s]  does he go anywhere else okay guys quit screwing around here okay he doesn't
[11009.06s -> 11013.74s]  he doesn't look like a person he looks doesn't look a person to me
[11013.74s -> 11017.02s]  he looks like you know gordon ramsay's show when he puts on a bunch of
[11017.02s -> 11020.06s]  masks and makeup and stuff and pretends to be somebody in the restaurant that's
[11020.06s -> 11026.50s]  what it looks like
[11033.26s -> 11041.30s]  this guy's doing undercover boss right now all right so very easy
[11041.86s -> 11046.18s]  we found out here but can i be like come here
[11046.18s -> 11050.34s]  come sit with me i don't think so uh all right so i need to make a
[11050.34s -> 11054.47s]  distraction this guy only does this so we have to

[12579.03s -> 12588.06s]  no how do i do this just throw it in the water
[12588.06s -> 12592.60s]  okay i'm gonna throw it into the water that's water right
[12592.60s -> 12603.00s]  that's hitting the water currently correct
[12603.00s -> 12614.47s]  is it a shadow that's because you're i have to leave now
[12614.47s -> 12621.05s]  where's there an exit oh come on don't even
[12621.05s -> 12625.10s]  i have to get to the exit i only have one exit
[12625.10s -> 12650.22s]  wait how do i get out of here i'm taking the gun where's this gun
[12650.22s -> 12653.77s]  where is it let's have to run out the door okay all right easy

[12668.82s -> 12675.72s]  there oh clean i did it clean very clean
[12675.72s -> 12683.18s]  see you later that was hard that was fun though
[12683.18s -> 12694.44s]  come on give me two three stars come on someone could hurt them so there's even
[12694.44s -> 12702.42s]  more to do here i guess technically not you did it
[12702.42s -> 12708.60s]  start with the standard loadout electrician with the bank rubber disguise
[12708.60s -> 12712.63s]  very cool three stars i'll take it so you just do
[12712.63s -> 12714.95s]  it faster is that how you get higher stars
[12714.95s -> 12728.89s]  so what's the next one yeah you just gotta go faster what about let's look at
[12728.89s -> 12733.75s]  the details fresh disguise silent takedown
[12733.75s -> 12741.75s]  unnoticed never spotted no notice kills no recordings at all non-target kill
[12741.75s -> 12750.39s]  how would you get the cop away without making them both get up
[12750.39s -> 12754.92s]  you know what i mean seems hard to do that with a coin but wouldn't they both
[12754.92s -> 12758.94s]  stand up all right we got another one if any
[12758.94s -> 12762.70s]  non-targets are eliminated you will immediately fail the mission
[12762.70s -> 12766.52s]  i have to retrieve the burial dagger i have to
[12766.52s -> 12776.09s]  kill these two with the burial dagger oh no and electrocution
[12776.09s -> 12786.71s]  holy shit yeah that's not possible i don't think i can do that one
[12786.71s -> 12794.47s]  so here's elusive target this is interesting good afternoon 47
[12794.47s -> 12800.87s]  your target is etta davis also known as the angel of death the target is a
[12800.87s -> 12803.75s]  retired nurse believed to have killed dozens of
[12803.75s -> 12807.19s]  patients in retirement homes and hospitals across great britain
[12807.19s -> 12811.03s]  okay her preferred technique is poison though in later years
[12811.03s -> 12815.83s]  she's begun to prefer blunt weapons and violent accidents such as falls
[12815.83s -> 12820.07s]  ongoing intercepts have tracked her to marrakech well i can only one chance
[12820.07s -> 12822.63s]  predictions that she's expanding her hunting grounds
[12822.63s -> 12826.87s]  i can only do this one time oh no that's not good while the target may look like
[12826.87s -> 12830.23s]  a harmless old lady it is certain that she will kill again
[12830.23s -> 12833.27s]  repeatedly given the opportunity the clock is
[12833.27s -> 12840.39s]  ticking 47 good luck one chance planning do i get to plan
[12840.39s -> 12846.82s]  anything i do all right let's do the let's take
[12846.82s -> 12853.30s]  the silver baller i'm gonna stay in the regular suit
[12853.30s -> 12867.03s]  fiber wire i never use small gold bar interesting i'll try it coins
[12867.03s -> 12873.94s]  okay i'm gonna pee before this because i only get one chance
[12873.94s -> 12878.26s]  yeah it's piss time it's been like almost four hours and it's time to pee
[12878.26s -> 13049.67s]  see you guys in a minute howdy so this is going to go very very poorly i assume
[13049.67s -> 13056.28s]  because it's been it's been like six months or so or four or
[13056.28s -> 13058.84s]  five months since i've been even on this map
[13058.84s -> 13072.76s]  so no idea we'll find out all right let's go this contract is an elusive
[13072.76s -> 13075.80s]  target when playing an elusive target the following rules apply
[13075.80s -> 13079.64s]  you must begin the contract before the countdown expires
[13079.64s -> 13083.80s]  if you die you can't retry if you completed the contract and successfully
[13083.80s -> 13090.14s]  exited you may not retry it okay you can't
[13090.14s -> 13092.54s]  restart the contract you cannot save your game
[13092.54s -> 13099.35s]  the contract briefing may contain additional fail conditions
[13099.35s -> 13105.59s]  start the timer now because i think it's a win for me
[13105.59s -> 13111.69s]  if i last five minutes five minutes from right now if i'm still in this mission
[13111.69s -> 13123.46s]  then i win good afternoon 47 we have been unable
[13123.46s -> 13126.10s]  to determine the target specific location
[13126.10s -> 13131.27s]  now it's too loud it's like it's like way too loud
[13131.27s -> 13134.39s]  it's super loud now i can't even imagine
[13134.39s -> 13138.71s]  what that explosion was like sent her a few hours ago
[13138.71s -> 13142.71s]  whatever you do don't accept a cup of tea from her 47
[13142.71s -> 13148.42s]  no tea good hunting it must have been so awful
[13148.42s -> 13156.79s]  all right so we've got where is she in regards to the map itself uh
[13156.79s -> 13168.98s]  let's find out my god where are you i don't even know where she is
[13168.98s -> 13179.93s]  oh my god this is gonna be hard all right we need intel
[13179.93s -> 13197.69s]  she's right there huh okay area discovered brick don't pick up the brick
[13197.69s -> 13208.12s]  sorry man but you're just making me feel a little uncomfortable now okay
[13208.12s -> 13215.59s]  what is this is him okay i can get up there
[13215.59s -> 13226.62s]  not allowed up there guaranteed hello i definitely can't go this way right

[13233.42s -> 13235.98s]  right let's go this way i'm assuming i could probably break
[13235.98s -> 13241.19s]  somebody in an alleyway oh screwdriver that takes care of
[13241.19s -> 13247.45s]  that and a wrench good to have cause an oil

[13280.47s -> 13283.59s]  in the alley here and then i'm so paranoid because if i
[13283.59s -> 13294.14s]  do anything wrong it's over how you been there's so many people
[13294.14s -> 13309.58s]  that could just get an accidental wrench markets where the hell are you

[14943.93s -> 14962.86s]  so these two are dlc so my uh stream is not alive welcome to siberia 47
[14962.86s -> 14967.58s]  i could do something cool in this one instead of just headshot people

[14973.40s -> 14979.69s]  located near the freezing siberian tundra here you're tasked with the
[14979.69s -> 14983.53s]  elimination of vitale reznikov try to kill somebody with an apple
[14983.53s -> 14988.01s]  and roman kabko renowned russian mobster with suspected political ties
[14989.53s -> 14994.01s]  roman kabko has been a prisoner might be possible for the past decade
[14994.01s -> 14997.29s]  but his function more is a second in command than a prisoner
[14998.17s -> 15002.97s]  now he wants out and has offered warden reznikov a bribe to facilitate an early
[15002.97s -> 15008.65s]  release scheduled to take place today kabko's offer comes at an opportune time
[15008.65s -> 15013.05s]  for reznikov it's like a swole golem united nations human rights kind of does
[15014.89s -> 15018.57s]  a string of recent news articles has exposed violence and even murder
[15018.57s -> 15024.62s]  as everyday occurrences in perm 14 our client suspects that kabko's release
[15024.62s -> 15030.22s]  could cause serious diplomatic issues both targets must be eliminated along
[15030.22s -> 15033.02s]  with reznikov's mercenary does the cold mess with how i shoot the gun
[15034.22s -> 15040.78s]  note that the prison's regular guards are not sanctioned targets now the riot is brewing in
[15040.78s -> 15045.98s]  the prison which could be used to our advantage since our client has asked we eliminate the
[15045.98s -> 15051.10s]  targets clandestine you will need to find a way to set the riot off and use it as a
[15051.10s -> 15065.11s]  so i can't just shoot people eliminate the warden roman and then the siberian tigers
[15065.11s -> 15091.61s]  mission is now active nice extended magazine nice it's already on there right yeah okay cause
[15091.61s -> 15097.53s]  a riot and then eliminate as many members of the mercenary death squad as possible so these are
[15097.53s -> 15120.79s]  the two targets see what i can do so i have to start a riot too so i can't just shoot guy so there
[15120.87s -> 15133.37s]  is that is the fucking window he went through the window he went through the window oh i'm damn good

[15218.26s -> 15224.44s]  that is vitale resnikov corrupt warden here at the perm 14 prison facility okay
[15226.20s -> 15230.76s]  so if there needs to be a riot in here how do i cause a riot in here probably shoot one of these

[20295.21s -> 20303.69s]  test it's important to stress that there's no pass or fail here it's merely a standard
[20303.69s -> 20308.09s]  personality test meant to gauge how you'll put into our corporate culture all right if
[20308.09s -> 20313.93s]  you're ready let's kick this off okay i'm ready okay so this is a very simple test all you do is
[20313.93s -> 20318.41s]  pick a card and tell us what you see there now it's important to point out that there are no
[20318.41s -> 20322.49s]  right or wrong answers the right answers are about behind them spoiler for everybody watching
[20323.69s -> 20329.21s]  we already did this this is just cleaning it up yes i'm ready all right mr thomas let's proceed
[20329.21s -> 20338.12s]  then if you will please pick the card that most conjures up the word opportunity that one okay
[20340.70s -> 20347.30s]  this is an interesting one what do you see here take in the whole image please and in as much
[20347.30s -> 20352.18s]  detail as possible tell me what this reminds you of what the hell are you talking about
[20353.83s -> 20358.47s]  uh you i thought you guys told you guys said that it's the ones that are just right behind them
[20361.75s -> 20370.81s]  fucking really really stupid like i i i i have no there's no defense on that one
[20371.29s -> 20376.65s]  so i got plenty of offense it's nearly a standard personality test i can't defend that one
[20377.85s -> 20381.93s]  no way i can't all right i can say anything to you guys and it would this i'm ready what do i say
[20381.93s -> 20387.13s]  about that so this is a very simple test all you do is pick a card and tell us what you see there
[20387.13s -> 20391.85s]  there ain't nothing i can do about that that there are no right or wrong answers here it's just to
[20391.85s -> 20397.21s]  give us a better impression of who you are on a psychological level does that make sense yes
[20397.29s -> 20402.73s]  i'm ready all right mr thomas let's proceed then you'd be digging a deeper grave please pick the
[20402.73s -> 20407.85s]  card yeah there's no dude condors up the word okay let opportunity i know sometimes uh when i'm
[20407.85s -> 20415.38s]  wrong that's one of those times this one all right now look at it closely completely then tell me
[20415.38s -> 20425.40s]  do you see an animal or an object animal i see what kind of animal a bird an eagle perhaps very
[20425.40s -> 20434.60s]  interesting a forceful animal anything else it's feeding on something feeding on what a carcass
[20435.56s -> 20440.52s]  the scene is reflected in a pool of blood flowing from the body and do they not know
[20440.52s -> 20449.00s]  it's a vulture feeding on someone else's kill that's very graphic mr thomas yes brutal even
[20449.00s -> 20457.00s]  right very interesting observation mr thomas not what we expected but that's perfectly fine
[20457.64s -> 20462.68s]  let's take the next one shall we pick any of the remaining cards that make you think of
[20463.24s -> 20477.37s]  execution please this one the one all the way to the left this one good choice tell me what
[20477.37s -> 20482.89s]  is the first thing you see here just the very first thing that comes to mind i see a figure in
[20482.89s -> 20490.25s]  a large coat perspective skewed as if i'm looking at him from the ground he's got something in his
[20490.25s -> 20498.97s]  hand he's got something in his hand go on he's on he has dual fire fire caliber pistols i see what
[20498.97s -> 20505.85s]  else do you see he's just finished a job i see perfectly executed and who is this man it's me
[20505.85s -> 20527.99s]  very very interesting mr thomas i think it's this one very good this is an interesting one
[20529.11s -> 20531.83s]  what i like to do an interview is that i like to put my hands on my mouth and just go

[21916.38s -> 21944.70s]  original okay so here's this one and like very very clearly that's a lot of work look at how much
[21944.70s -> 21966.22s]  work that is what the hell is this it isn't really though that's the original no this is the original
[21968.84s -> 21974.22s]  i'm gonna go right to the twitter where it came from the background is plain it's easier to do
[21978.74s -> 21986.60s]  all right so let's this is the original i'll put it next to the other one just so you can see i gotta
[21986.60s -> 22005.18s]  defend myself here otherwise come on what we're gonna do that's not that it where is it okay here

[22179.69s -> 22184.02s]  stream makes me happy to know that you're not playing a character and you're genuinely an
[22184.02s -> 22189.64s]  amazing person anyway proof that you're actually five eight and a video proof of it as well i've

[22345.69s -> 22349.37s]  doctored photo like i thought that it was going to be like they made their own tape measure
[22351.88s -> 22356.04s]  and okay i've seen a lot of people say why do you look so weird here it's i don't know
[22356.86s -> 22360.30s]  it's the it's the camera like this camera was like strange it was it was like i was

[22435.58s -> 22448.23s]  afterwards as well it was ten dollars from uh anonymous i think can you even do that i don't
[22448.23s -> 22455.10s]  see there's nothing here just says a thousand bits came in uh from nobody i guess that's
[22455.10s -> 22461.80s]  interesting that's new uh at my starfish thanks for the five community subs appreciate it
[22466.57s -> 22476.39s]  zake thanks for the 250 bits they say uh they they say you have uh you uh i think it's different
[22476.39s -> 22482.39s]  language i'm not sure what that means i don't know how to say it but they say when cooking stream
[22482.39s -> 22491.37s]  just wait maybe someday maybe someday i'll do a cooking stream i don't know just wait it might
[22491.37s -> 22502.55s]  happen i don't know you've been asking for it yeah it's possible someday someday confirmed in
[22502.55s -> 22508.52s]  the future he'll look into it that's right hey sad vega thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents
[22508.52s -> 22519.96s]  250 bits i need to see you do 250 box steps right now uh that would probably take 20 minutes i don't
[22519.96s -> 22531.11s]  have a box to step on unfortunately but thank you thank you apple shift for the 250 bits hey yo do
[22531.11s -> 22538.34s]  you have a set date for the community art stream uh friday i'm gonna try to get everything compiled
[22538.34s -> 22551.24s]  on friday if not friday then probably no there's no reason why it wouldn't be friday yeah it's
[22551.24s -> 22557.43s]  i mean that that channel has been active for just about a full month now so we'll see what's there
[22557.43s -> 22563.05s]  if i don't think there's enough there for a whole couple hours or two three hours at least then
[22564.18s -> 22570.42s]  i'll do it another time but this should be enough there this is going to be a one-time thing or
[22570.42s -> 22579.90s]  monthly or something it is going to be every time i think there is enough content there to do one
[22579.90s -> 22586.18s]  whether that's once a month or once every other month once there's enough to do a full at least
[22586.18s -> 22594.26s]  couple hours that's when they'll happen and i will announce them at least three four days to at least
[22594.26s -> 22601.00s]  two or three days in advance that they're going to happen usually like a week the last the last
[22601.00s -> 22606.01s]  thing i said about it was before twitchcon i said we would do it after twitchcon at some point so
[22606.01s -> 22613.70s]  friday seems like it's the good day to do it thank you fiti for the 250 bits i forgot you only read
[22613.86s -> 22620.95s]  messages with at least 250 so i'm going to copy and paste from before when i give 100 this message
[22620.95s -> 22624.63s]  has been brought to you by the i pay extra money to add disclaimer for the off chance that the
[22624.63s -> 22637.00s]  streamer reads both copies of the message for some reason gang thank you fiti for the six dollars
[22637.00s -> 22642.14s]  here and they say literally everything you do is funny to me jeremy thank you for always being
[22642.14s -> 22647.11s]  there for me throughout the years you always manage to distract me from the bad things in life
[22647.11s -> 22650.47s]  for years i've been struggling to fall asleep as my mind would always wander to some really
[22650.47s -> 22655.40s]  terrible fucked up stuff that left me anxious and unable to calm down whenever i have one of
[22655.40s -> 22659.93s]  your streams of vods on in the background i can sleep like a baby thank you from the bottom of
[22659.93s -> 22671.50s]  my heart thank you fiti if these streams are a nice little wind down for anybody yeah however

[22706.33s -> 22710.25s]  just kind of need something just to have on the background or people some people guys a lot of
[22710.25s -> 22715.70s]  people do twitch while they're at work working on a project they just have a tab on another random
[22715.70s -> 22726.22s]  tab just open with almost like a radio station that's all right that doesn't bother me i don't
[22726.22s -> 22732.87s]  know why it would it didn't just kind of however you are consuming what the stream is that's fine
[22732.87s -> 22739.88s]  to me as long as you're getting something out of it that's cool hey thank you maris or maris for

[22795.08s -> 22802.76s]  couldn't do a hey meet me under this sign i i explicitly asked and i was told that you can't
[22802.76s -> 22814.92s]  do that so next year at twitchcon i'm gonna do an official meet and greet at a booth somewhere just
[22814.92s -> 22818.44s]  because i know there's a lot of people that probably wanted to say hello i know i saw at

[23017.82s -> 23022.38s]  because they've added a few great features that i really want to use and it's annoying because i
[23022.38s -> 23029.42s]  just went back i just went to stream labs obs and then found out that they added an insanely
[23030.06s -> 23036.84s]  helpful feature on the new obs that released last week so i'll be back to them unfortunately
[23036.84s -> 23043.30s]  because i really liked stream labs obs's layout but the regular obs is just probably way better
[23043.30s -> 23050.17s]  for me at this point so shit but um where the hell is my credits why are they not here
[23050.17s -> 23072.25s]  where are the credits hello credits where the fuck did they go how come where are my credits

[23252.14s -> 23255.34s]  what i mean by that and my mental health has been deteriorating for about a year and a half
[23256.06s -> 23267.32s]  i'm really sorry to hear that i was in kind of a mood and about to get fired from the only job
[23267.32s -> 23273.38s]  i had one of the only reasons i didn't is because the carnival stream so you are a literal lifesaver

[23296.78s -> 23304.95s]  it's rough and it's hard to do everybody has their own way of getting through it
[23304.95s -> 23330.01s]  but i really really hope that you can find the right way forward things can get better but it
[23330.01s -> 23332.97s]  may i mean it's not you're saying i don't want to ruin the vibes or anything but
[23335.24s -> 23341.45s]  no it's it's just we're all people man i might be on a live stream platform but
[23343.00s -> 23354.30s]  i felt like shit before let me tell you oh yeah everybody has their own path forward
[23355.24s -> 23363.94s]  and my path forward might not be the same for you everybody's very different but i really truly hope
[23363.94s -> 23372.63s]  you find it and i'm really glad that you like the carnival stream because uh i made the thing for
[23374.20s -> 23382.12s]  all of you that's the only reason why i did it and if i'm able to do something like that again

[23600.01s -> 23605.61s]  much out of order i've never done dark souls 2 on stream except for that one time when some
[23605.61s -> 23612.33s]  fucking guy climbed in my window and boy was that annoying and it ruined the rest of my playthrough
[23613.05s -> 23619.70s]  i never played it again after that something with things just sour your playthrough you can't go
[23619.70s -> 23628.47s]  back to them you know what i mean and then bloodborne i've beaten a hundred times already so
