[0.00s -> 16.38s]  Look at the people in the background. This dude looks like he's holding two cups that are just invisible.
[16.38s -> 20.07s]  Hey, can I get one of those soldiers you're holding, dude?
[20.07s -> 23.07s]  In your default position?
[23.07s -> 26.63s]  I'll just kill this guy. I don't know how much health everybody has.
[26.63s -> 32.26s]  This technique seems to be working pretty well. Oh, another guy. Another guy holding two cups in his hands.
[32.26s -> 38.72s]  Excellent. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[38.72s -> 47.30s]  Can I please get out of here? I broke his sword.
[47.30s -> 51.79s]  We've been fighting for so long, this guy's sword is broken in half.
[51.79s -> 56.79s]  Yet for some reason he still continues to fight me and I still can't bring his health down past 5%.
[56.79s -> 61.38s]  Like, I have to be doing something wrong, right?
[61.38s -> 64.38s]  I have to be.
[64.38s -> 70.18s]  Both of us wouldn't have arms or legs anymore.
[70.18s -> 74.18s]  So now both of our swords are broken, which means this is a candlestick fight.
[74.18s -> 80.90s]  Notice the design work on the candles.
[80.90s -> 84.90s]  Can we stop this, please? End the fucking tutorial. God.
[84.90s -> 88.65s]  This is sad. How do I stop this?
[88.65s -> 96.94s]  We're fighting with two broken swords.
[96.94s -> 101.31s]  This guy's wearing like a speedo.
[101.31s -> 105.55s]  Everybody is talking at once.
[105.55s -> 109.37s]  I can't understand this.
[109.37s -> 113.76s]  Can you please talk it one at a time?
[113.76s -> 116.76s]  Big battle.
[116.76s -> 120.77s]  Help, I don't want to die.
[120.77s -> 123.77s]  Whoa.
[123.77s -> 126.77s]  He actually did it?
[126.77s -> 130.20s]  Holy shit.
[130.20s -> 136.36s]  I didn't think that was that. I thought he was going to just yell it like a taunt, like a command.
[136.36s -> 141.65s]  Am I on the train tracks? Can I move?
[141.65s -> 146.34s]  Train's coming. The fucking train is coming.
[146.34s -> 156.60s]  No way. That's it? What happened?
[156.60s -> 161.61s]  I don't even know what to even describe what just happened.
[161.61s -> 167.42s]  Did I lose?
[167.42s -> 171.23s]  Hey, I'm allowed to kill you if I want to.
[171.23s -> 175.82s]  That's not too extreme end of the spectrum. I don't know what is.
[175.82s -> 178.82s]  Oh, hey, hello. I'm going to kill you if I want.
[178.82s -> 194.39s]  This guy's not doing so well.
[194.39s -> 199.39s]  Get out of the way. Don't you see him having fun making this guy stay standing?
[199.39s -> 205.96s]  What is she saying? Oh, fuck.
[205.96s -> 208.90s]  No, will you watch out?
[208.90s -> 212.08s]  Lady, if you don't see, I'm kind of busy right now.
[212.08s -> 217.78s]  Take another egg.
[217.78s -> 220.14s]  I'm not paying for it.
[220.14s -> 225.07s]  All right. That was pretty easy.
[225.07s -> 228.14s]  I just had to not pay for the egg.
[228.14s -> 232.02s]  These guys are on the case.
[232.02s -> 237.85s]  Crime rate? I've been arre...
[237.85s -> 240.60s]  You get arrested?
[240.60s -> 243.03s]  There's just an egg. Come on.
[243.03s -> 247.62s]  So I stole an egg. What are you going to do?
[247.62s -> 251.12s]  You're going to like slap me on the wrist?
[251.12s -> 255.13s]  I am naked tied up in a dungeon.
[255.13s -> 258.13s]  Other naked dudes are throwing slabs of granite at me.
[258.13s -> 262.57s]  I took an egg.
[262.57s -> 266.58s]  Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
[266.58s -> 269.58s]  Can I ask you a question? Do you know where the nearest subway is?
[269.58s -> 271.58s]  I know I could ask one of the officers around here,
[271.58s -> 274.58s]  but you seem like a citizen that knows what they're talking about.
[274.58s -> 278.58s]  So should I take a right down the street or is it a left?
[278.58s -> 282.33s]  Yeah. Okay. So I should go that way.
[282.33s -> 286.04s]  Oh, no.
[286.04s -> 288.28s]  Somebody's hurt over here.
[288.28s -> 291.16s]  The dude with the...
[291.16s -> 295.16s]  You're telling me the dude with the fucking box on his head can't see?
[295.16s -> 299.58s]  No way. That's unheard of.
[299.58s -> 304.86s]  Again, like, what the fuck are you people doing?
[304.86s -> 306.86s]  What are you doing? Why would you do something like that?
[306.86s -> 310.86s]  You can't see or hear the thing tracking along the...
[310.86s -> 314.55s]  Hey, watch me! Hey, watch this! Hey, watch me!
[314.55s -> 320.07s]  Let's go fishing in the man-made moat with no fish in it.
[320.07s -> 322.38s]  That sounds like a plan.
[322.38s -> 326.09s]  Did you shake... That guy knew.
[326.09s -> 329.09s]  See, that guy knew there were no fish in here.
[329.09s -> 333.09s]  Oh, he was wrong. He was wrong. There's crabs in here.
[333.09s -> 337.87s]  Hey, old lady. Edge up!
[337.87s -> 343.86s]  No. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not...
[343.86s -> 346.86s]  No, no, no, no. Ma'am. Ma'am, you okay?
[346.86s -> 354.83s]  Ma'am? I killed her.
[354.83s -> 356.83s]  I don't know who they're... Who is he cheering on?
[356.83s -> 363.58s]  Shoot him! Shoot this guy!
[363.58s -> 367.10s]  These guys all have guns.
[367.10s -> 370.10s]  Will you please light this guy up? Oh, my God.
[370.10s -> 372.47s]  Shoot him. Somebody shoot him.
[372.47s -> 376.10s]  The seven of you with guns, shoot this guy.
[376.10s -> 380.10s]  He's trying to kill me with his blade.
[380.10s -> 383.47s]  You guys are running around like cockroaches.
[383.47s -> 392.79s]  I just drank a beer.
[392.79s -> 396.61s]  This is so exciting. You just slashed me with a fucking blade.
[396.61s -> 398.61s]  I'm going to chug my beer.
[398.61s -> 403.77s]  This guy can do whatever he wants and nobody cares.
[403.77s -> 405.77s]  Let's see how long this takes.
[405.77s -> 412.94s]  Where is this guy's health?
[412.94s -> 420.30s]  Because I feel like this guy's taken at least 15 to 30 bullets into his body.
[420.30s -> 424.30s]  Like, that was a neck shot. He shot him directly into his neck.
[424.30s -> 427.30s]  That was in the head. That was in his face.
[427.30s -> 431.19s]  Is he dead? Oh, I think he's finally...
[431.19s -> 433.19s]  No, he's running. He's running. He's running.
[433.19s -> 438.46s]  He's running. He's running. Put this down.
[438.46s -> 440.46s]  No! Don't let him get away!
[440.46s -> 442.46s]  Don't let him get away!
[442.46s -> 444.46s]  No!
