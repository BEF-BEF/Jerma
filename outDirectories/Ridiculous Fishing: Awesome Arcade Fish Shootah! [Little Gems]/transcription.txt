[0.31s -> 13.07s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jirba here with Ridiculous Fishing.
[13.07s -> 18.07s]  This is an iOS device mobile game for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.
[18.07s -> 24.24s]  And it is a great one. We're gonna talk about this, gonna break it down in the little gem fashion that you are used to.
[24.24s -> 31.24s]  Now, before the video gets started, I need to address this because there's gonna be at least a dozen people in the comments section that are gonna say this.
[31.24s -> 34.24s]  And I wanna address it before the video even goes anywhere.
[34.24s -> 38.74s]  So Ridiculous Fishing is not a copy of Ninja Fishing.
[38.74s -> 41.24s]  A lot of you guys have probably already played that game, Ninja Fishing.
[41.24s -> 49.24s]  There's a lot of controversy surrounding these two games because Ridiculous Fishing, of course, was an old game in 2000.
[49.24s -> 51.74s]  I believe 2010 is when it first came out.
[51.74s -> 56.24s]  And it was a free flash game. You just played it. I think it was called Radical Fishing was the actual title.
[56.24s -> 60.74s]  But Ninja Fishing took inspiration from it and made their own game.
[60.74s -> 64.24s]  And there was a lot of BS surrounding it. Everyone was like, wow, this is a copy. What's gonna...
[64.24s -> 68.24s]  It's kind of like... It sort of reminds me of the DayZ WarZee situation,
[68.24s -> 72.24s]  where the DayZ developers were working on the DayZ standalone.
[72.24s -> 77.24s]  And then the WarZee kind of came along and was like, but look, come play our game. It's like the same thing, but like, cool, right?
[77.24s -> 80.24s]  It's sort of that situation. That's the best way I can really describe it.
[80.24s -> 82.24s]  But with all that, I'm not gonna go into that any further.
[82.24s -> 85.24s]  This is just to let you know, this is not a copy of any game.
[85.24s -> 88.57s]  This is the original, as they say.
[88.57s -> 93.07s]  So Ridiculous Fishing is, as the title suggests, a fishing game.
[93.07s -> 97.57s]  You cast your line into the water, you try to get as deep as possible, and you catch fish.
[97.57s -> 105.07s]  So what you do when you catch the fish is where this game really deviates from many of the fishing games you've probably ever played.
[105.07s -> 109.07s]  When you get to the top of the water, you shoot the hell out of everything you catch.
[109.07s -> 114.57s]  So it's... There are a lot of guns in the game, too. There's pistols, machine guns, like laser beams.
[114.57s -> 119.07s]  There's a lot of different upgrades you can get for gun-wise to destroy these fish.
[119.07s -> 121.88s]  Some that are more effective than others.
[121.88s -> 126.88s]  But regardless of what you choose for an arsenal, the shooting mechanics are just plain fun.
[126.88s -> 128.88s]  The game feels very polished and refined.
[128.88s -> 133.38s]  There's no real bugs I've found yet that have been like, what the hell just happened? I shot that fish.
[133.38s -> 135.38s]  This is bullshit. Like, that hasn't happened yet.
[135.38s -> 139.38s]  And not to mention the fun, pixelated, retro kind of art style.
[139.38s -> 141.88s]  It just adds more flair to it in general.
[143.26s -> 147.26s]  And real briefly, we'll talk about the actual mechanics of the game, how it plays, how it works.
[147.26s -> 151.26s]  It's a tilt control game. So you hold your iPad, you hold your iPhone straight in the air,
[151.26s -> 154.76s]  and you go side to side to move the lure around.
[154.76s -> 158.26s]  And you don't want to touch anything. When you're going down, this is a big important thing.
[158.26s -> 164.26s]  While you're going down, if you bump into any fish, you're going to start your ascent upwards.
[164.26s -> 168.76s]  So you want to try to get as deep as humanly possible before you try to catch anything.
[168.76s -> 172.26s]  And you can upgrade how deep you can possibly go.
[172.26s -> 178.69s]  And a lot of you guys are probably wondering, Jerma, I just watched you smash into like a hundred fish.
[178.69s -> 181.19s]  What do you mean you have to avoid them? You're not doing that.
[181.19s -> 186.19s]  Well, that's specifically because I have a huge amount of upgrades into my fish grinder.
[186.19s -> 189.69s]  What that does is I can activate it by tapping on the screen and holding,
[189.69s -> 194.69s]  and I blend up anything that gets in my way so I don't have to go up prematurely.
[194.69s -> 200.56s]  The game soft caps you at certain meters that as you get money by shooting the fish,
[200.56s -> 205.06s]  that's how you actually make the money, you can keep upgrading to go lower and lower and lower.
[205.06s -> 209.06s]  And eventually it gets to be quite difficult because in the deep sea,
[209.06s -> 214.06s]  everything is dark and you have to get a lantern. You have to buy the different light upgrades.
[214.06s -> 218.06s]  There's a lot of stuff in this game for as simple as it possibly could be.
[218.06s -> 222.05s]  It's a ton of fun. There's a bunch of areas you can unlock.
[222.05s -> 225.05s]  There's a whole soundtrack. There's a lot of great things about this game.
[225.05s -> 230.55s]  And Vlambeer is a fantastic independent studio, guys, and I would highly recommend you play this game.
[230.55s -> 235.55s]  This is one of the best iPad, iPhone games to come out this year, absolutely guarantee.
[235.55s -> 238.05s]  I can guarantee you that, that that's going to be the case.
[238.05s -> 240.55s]  And it's $2.99 on the App Store.
[240.55s -> 243.55s]  It might seem like a lot of money for a simple game like this, guys,
[243.55s -> 247.05s]  but with the upgrade system, the amount of fun you can have just by sitting there playing,
[247.05s -> 250.55s]  I was in the DMV playing this game for like two and a half hours,
[250.55s -> 254.55s]  and it was almost like I wasn't even at the DMV. It was fantastic.
[254.55s -> 258.55s]  So that alone is reason enough to pick up a game like this.
[258.55s -> 263.05s]  So go support Vlambeer, guys. They're actually the same people that made Super Crate Box,
[263.05s -> 265.55s]  which is a little gem in its own right.
[265.55s -> 267.05s]  And that's going to wrap up the video.
[267.05s -> 270.05s]  So again, this is a universal app for iOS devices.
[270.05s -> 274.55s]  As long as you have iOS 5.0 or higher, you can play this game.
[274.55s -> 276.55s]  So thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.
[276.55s -> 280.05s]  I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
[280.05s -> 281.05s]  Little gems.
