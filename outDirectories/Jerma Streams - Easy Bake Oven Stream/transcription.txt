[201.86s -> 210.34s]  It's for the PlayStation 2
[210.34s -> 214.18s]  I had a panic moment here like two or three hours ago where I was like
[214.18s -> 219.10s]  What happened to the mic that I actually always use? Where is it do a sexy pose?
[222.60s -> 226.48s]  Alright, that wasn't alright. Listen to me. This is important. Is it how is it crusty?

[258.54s -> 263.50s]  Yeah, it's cuz I'm speaking out directly out this way and it looks like I'm on fucking QVC
[263.94s -> 267.86s]  Presenting the easy vague of them, which I'm not by the way, this is I gotta make this really really clear
[267.86s -> 269.92s]  This is really important
[269.92s -> 273.68s]  They have nothing to do with this. I know it's presented in a way like they would
[274.00s -> 278.00s]  They have nothing to do with this. This is not I know it looks like an ad stream, but I swear to God
[278.00s -> 280.74s]  This is not an ad stream
[281.18s -> 286.71s]  This is just something that we came up with this thing hot. Okay, it is I'm like afraid of this
[286.71s -> 287.91s]  Have we talked about that yet?
[287.91s -> 293.63s]  How like I'm actually kind of terrified of this fucking thing because the old easy baked oven had a window here
[293.71s -> 297.84s]  Well, you could see what the fuck was going on now this new one
[297.84s -> 306.98s]  This is like the new age one. They've just wait did I peel the plastic off this? No, that's supposed to stay on there
[306.98s -> 311.34s]  Okay, the old one had a window that you could look through but this one just
[312.04s -> 314.84s]  Fucking it. How are you supposed to know when the food is done?
[314.92s -> 318.48s]  You just stuff it in here and wait like five minutes and then pull it out
[318.60s -> 325.78s]  How are you supposed to know because those of you guys that are like me whenever I use a real oven
[325.78s -> 329.71s]  I have to go up to the oven turn the oven light on and just sit there and watch
[330.15s -> 332.75s]  Because I don't trust anything. I don't trust myself
[332.75s -> 335.23s]  I don't trust the oven there if it's like 400 degrees
[335.23s -> 339.03s]  You have to do a pizza for like 20 minutes that oven light has to be on at all times
[339.03s -> 341.75s]  And I have to fucking is it burnt is it burnt is it no no is it burnt is it burnt?
[341.87s -> 348.54s]  So I can't really do that with this. What a loser. I mean, that's what I do. I don't I don't cook

[402.72s -> 407.62s]  I was thinking about doing a joke when this first started where I was gonna like oh I'm thirsty and do a dog
[407.74s -> 412.64s]  Lapping up out of the bowl joke, but then I was like, no, that's fucked up. I don't think I want to do that

[1542.18s -> 1544.44s]  It's contaminated it's not
[1545.02s -> 1552.96s]  Contaminated guys all this came from the same fucking factory. What do you mean contaminated?
[1552.96s -> 1562.08s]  This all came from the same conveyor belt in between in between like pushing out glue. This is the same factory
[1562.22s -> 1563.74s]  This is my opinion. There's a joke
[1563.74s -> 1567.42s]  I just want to make sure that you know that Hasbro had nothing to do with this and this is me making up a satire on
[1567.42s -> 1569.66s]  What could possibly be going on in a weird factory?
[1569.74s -> 1572.36s]  There's nothing to do with they'd have nothing to do with this and I have nothing to do with them
[1572.38s -> 1582.20s]  These are just my comedic opinions on things that aren't even real to joke and it's the satire
[1582.20s -> 1590.86s]  It's a parody of moment. Okay, what do I do water? How much water two tablespoons of water?
[1590.86s -> 1607.54s]  This is actually like fun though. Can I be honest? Is that too much water? What is this supposed to be?
[1607.54s -> 1613.02s]  What cut what kind of what do you do? What Pete's what do you do with pizza? This is what is this?
[1613.02s -> 1617.15s]  How is this a pizza? This is this is like dog puke
[1619.59s -> 1623.63s]  This is not I have to use the spoon. I know just get rid of the handle
[1623.67s -> 1640.72s]  Just get rid of the I get rid of the handle whatever if this still works. It's just annoying. Okay, what's what is that?
[1640.72s -> 1647.14s]  What's the FDA or the what FTC say about food being out for how long there's 20 minutes, right?
[1647.14s -> 1651.44s]  They use it like food can be sitting out before it starts to be like poison. What is it? Somebody knows it
[1651.46s -> 1671.24s]  That's this is this is not I don't like that. This is just to like make the dough look like it's cooked two minutes
[1671.24s -> 1680.62s]  I can't believe that thing just broke in my hand. That's unbelievable. Best part about this is because there's so little stuff
[1680.62s -> 1682.92s]  I've realistically just have to like wipe
[1683.26s -> 1688.71s]  Wipe wipe wipe and then just like to be ready for the next one because this is barely anything
[1688.75s -> 1696.74s]  All right, make them now. It's time to make the pizza. We need one pizza dough and one
[1704.22s -> 1708.86s]  Nothing like in there, right? Okay, we need one pizza dough mix and one tablespoon of water
[1708.86s -> 1723.25s]  There are two pizza dough mix is why spit spit you want me to spit in this no
[1723.45s -> 1739.15s]  I'm not spitting in this are you guys fucking crazy? Why are there two? Why are there two of these? Okay ports?
[1739.15s -> 1746.24s]  I'm whatever. I don't know why there's two you make two pizzas spit in it. I'm not gonna spit in this bowl
[1746.24s -> 1752.00s]  I'm not even I think I think that's like not even allowed on twitch. Can you spit on twitch is spitting allowed on twitch?
[1753.12s -> 1755.12s]  Can I like spit is that allowed?
[1757.26s -> 1764.01s]  Spit switch. Am I gonna get like banned for like spitting in this bowl? Oh water
[1764.23s -> 1778.76s]  I've been looking no, that's not a good transition there. Okay. Okay. I'm almost ready
[1778.96s -> 1795.36s]  How long does it take to cook six pizzas six split the dough into six pieces and what a small balls
[1795.68s -> 1803.00s]  How am I supposed to me? How do you what do you mean? Are they supposed to be like bagel bites? What is the oh?
[1804.16s -> 1813.16s]  Shit, they're supposed to be little bagel bites. I thought it was gonna be like a like a like a I don't know
[1813.16s -> 1821.11s]  I don't like like it's like a Sicilian style like a like a square or something. I don't know. Okay, let's go
[1821.11s -> 1824.32s]  This I have to start using my hands. Oh boy, how much?
[1825.00s -> 1837.99s]  One tablespoon of water that's way more than a tablespoon shit. It's okay. Okay use your hands
[1838.59s -> 1869.60s]  Stir and press the mixture together until you get dough with my hands. Where's that shitty little thing? This is not pizza dough
[1869.88s -> 1878.22s]  How is this pizza dough? It's ruined. I need more water. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[1878.74s -> 1883.72s]  There's a hair in this. I can't use this anymore. I have to go to a new one
[1883.72s -> 1888.40s]  There's hair in here. Look, there's like a speck of something in there. Can you guys see in there?
[1888.60s -> 1898.19s]  Do you see the one speck of some kind of foreign debris? I can't even use this now. I hate that shit
[1898.23s -> 1902.72s]  I hate it. Okay, that's enough water. Put this book put this back down
[1902.76s -> 1907.65s]  Why did I have to do the complicated one first? This is definitely like the most complicated one
[1907.65s -> 1912.65s]  Why couldn't I just dump the brownie packet into the fucking ground and then just stir it up with my finger and put it in there?
[1912.65s -> 1928.14s]  That's what the next one's gonna be. This is not this is not pizza. This is not pizza dough. This is gonna be
[1928.66s -> 1933.62s]  Like crackers. This is the bottom of the Lay's potato chip bag
[1933.98s -> 1939.12s]  This is not this is the shit that you like dump out because it's not even edible
[1939.24s -> 1950.76s]  Yeah, and you think you get all cute you dump the fucking bag up and it goes half in here and like
[1951.46s -> 1955.70s]  75% go around and you crunch it it hits the floor and you like cut all around your teeth
[1955.70s -> 1969.50s]  I need more do I need more water somebody help him what use my hands
[1969.50s -> 1980.97s]  I'm not putting my fucking hands in this disgusting. I have to do I have to use my hands
[1980.97s -> 1988.94s]  I have to knead the dough. Okay, hold on. I
[1989.34s -> 1994.14s]  Okay, that thing started making weird noise
[1994.46s -> 1996.46s]  Where do I put this um
[1996.58s -> 2010.93s]  That's this just dough. Hold on. I need a like this, right? You go like like stand up for this
[2011.13s -> 2029.92s]  Why don't I just make one big pizza? Why do I have to make six more?
[2029.92s -> 2037.32s]  I need to you didn't have to do it. Just do it somebody somebody call OSHA. He didn't wash his hands
[2039.80s -> 2051.11s]  Okay, this is as good as it's gonna get like that. Okay. How are you supposed to make six?
[2051.43s -> 2060.75s]  This you don't make six out of this this is one this is smaller
[2060.75s -> 2073.11s]  I don't have to make a pizza. What does it say flatten each ball of dough?
[2073.11s -> 2106.68s]  Like a pancake and shape it into a circle. Okay, here we go. Is this too big? Holy fucking shit
[2106.76s -> 2114.16s]  Okay, but I gotta make it nice. All right, I'm doing like three
[2114.16s -> 2122.00s]  This is I feel like this is gonna bake into the pan and never come up like this is gonna be part of the pan
[2122.24s -> 2127.88s]  Okay, let's do another one. You don't have any oil. I
[2129.36s -> 2136.60s]  Didn't say I needed oil. I don't need oil. Do I use CBD oil?
[2136.60s -> 2150.46s]  I don't have CBD oil just spit on it. It's gotta be something I can butter
[2150.46s -> 2154.89s]  I do I thought it was all gonna be inside of the packages. I think it'll be alright
[2154.89s -> 2163.62s]  I think it's gonna be alright. Okay, here we go. I'll just I won't put it in there for that long go to the store. I
[2165.08s -> 2168.80s]  What do you want? Just leave the stream on well, I go to like a grocery store
[2169.32s -> 2174.96s]  Alright, how about this if this is a fucking disaster?
[2174.96s -> 2181.23s]  I'm going to like just go to a store and I'll put on like if the fucking I don't know put on like
[2181.31s -> 2195.23s]  Spongebob Squarepants OST. I'll be back unironically. Yes. Okay, here we go. Okay, I'm gonna do like two cuz this is just this is ridiculous

[2219.63s -> 2226.80s]  Why are you here right now? Oh my god shit. I gotta make this I gotta do this good
[2226.80s -> 2229.40s]  Then I can't just I can't believe I don't have any fucking cooking spray

[2235.48s -> 2246.48s]  There's two packets. There's no way you make six out of this. No fucking way
[2246.48s -> 2254.45s]  In fact, how am I gonna even put like the sauce on here? This doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense
[2254.45s -> 2264.82s]  I can't even fit this one on there. How small did they want you to make these? All right. Yeah. Oh, here we go
[2264.82s -> 2277.71s]  I'm ready on the next part. Oh, I ripped it in half, right use a pastry brush
[2278.31s -> 2290.66s]  To spread some glaze on top of the dough. What the eight-year-old has a pastry brush
[2290.78s -> 2305.78s]  It's it says you can use your finger. Okay, the glaze wait. This is like oil, right? Hold on
[2305.82s -> 2319.36s]  Wait, can I put this on the bottom too? This is like oil, isn't it? It's like a glaze. No, don't don't what do you mean?
[2319.36s -> 2331.52s]  No, why it's a it's like a it's like a glaze you're gonna burn it
[2331.52s -> 2353.39s]  No, am I didn't say that doesn't say could burn careful. I think that looks alright. Why would have this much glaze?
[2354.27s -> 2360.40s]  It smells
[2360.40s -> 2371.76s]  Okay, if I could like bring you here with me right now, this smells like it's like it's like it's like it's implanting me somewhere
[2371.76s -> 2375.08s]  Like I'm going somewhere right now. I'm like on a journey. I'm going to I'm going somewhere. Where am I going?
[2375.08s -> 2390.24s]  It's summertime. It's summertime. There's a hot dog vendor sausage vendor. Not hot dog toxic fumes. What? All right
[2390.24s -> 2394.11s]  Fuck. Never mind hot dog vendor sausage vendor
[2394.13s -> 2406.79s]  It's like the air the air that's coming off of the guy that makes those sausages that at the kiosk. Okay, that's good enough
[2407.19s -> 2426.20s]  This is fucking eight-year-olds. Yeah, right more like I'm just gonna wash my hands in here
[2426.20s -> 2438.82s]  I'm not gonna need the water anymore. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm gonna that's all right sausage sweat
[2439.24s -> 2443.86s]  Okay now spread the marinara sauce on top of the pizza
[2443.86s -> 2448.16s]  Be sure to save half the sauce for your second batch of pizzas. No, thanks
[2448.16s -> 2458.57s]  I think I think it's going in the trash. This trash is gonna smell so bad. Thank God
[2458.57s -> 2464.14s]  It's one of those like double ultra ones. All right, let's put the sauce on here. This is good for now
[2464.26s -> 2467.40s]  Okay, so sauce goes on top and
[2471.82s -> 2501.21s]  Can you see I did it? Right? That's what you do. You go you go middle out
[2501.49s -> 2520.50s]  What are those? What are those pastries that have like the raspberry filling in the middle?
[2520.58s -> 2527.94s]  What are those things called? You know talking about the little the cookies with the raspberry jam in the middle
[2528.08s -> 2535.37s]  That makes me want to eat those. I think this is too thick. I think that's the problem
[2535.37s -> 2544.58s]  How hot is it gonna get in there? I'm it's like freaking me out
[2544.58s -> 2549.43s]  I don't know why I feel like I'm gonna push that in there and like just like

[2567.49s -> 2574.74s]  That's enough sauce. That's a good amount of sauce. I think okay. I'm gonna put that in there now. Let's put the cheese on there
[2574.74s -> 2580.20s]  I think the cheese is supposed to not be solid
[2580.48s -> 2583.74s]  They're making it look like you can squeeze it out of a bag
[2586.30s -> 2591.10s]  Spoon the cheese into a plastic sandwich bag and cut a small hole in the corner squeeze out strings of cheese
[2591.74s -> 2608.03s]  Hey, hey, this is this is like they you this is like they do in the restaurants with that big glob of mozzarella
[2608.55s -> 2627.88s]  See and this is gonna spread out there. They are that I don't like a lot of cheese on my pizzas
[2627.88s -> 2634.64s]  How does that look? Can you see?
[2635.24s -> 2640.93s]  For some reason on the back of all the Ritz crackers boxes. This is what's on the back every single time
[2640.93s -> 2643.53s]  I don't know why I don't know who the fuck does that shit
[2643.53s -> 2648.45s]  I don't know who puts like sauce and like cheese and like Dorito powder on there. It's Ritz crackers
[2648.53s -> 2657.44s]  But I don't know why that they do that. All right now it's ready time to bake. All right bake for 12 minutes
[2658.00s -> 2665.24s]  12 fucking minutes. I thought this is gonna be like give 10 5

[2750.22s -> 2757.71s]  Yeah, it's in there and then you like push it out to the cooling side timers on the front of the oven
[2757.71s -> 2761.86s]  No, that's just it. That's a picture. That's not real. How the fuck am I gonna?

[2851.30s -> 2853.64s]  No, the timer on the front is a picture
[2854.30s -> 2862.25s]  Don't touch anything the timer on the front. It says 330 is a photo. It is a fake picture. It's a fake photo
[2862.25s -> 2864.25s]  Oh
[2864.85s -> 2873.86s]  Damn it. Imagine if I had somebody here with like a seagull on a stick like dropping it and trying to eat shit

[3137.05s -> 3143.50s]  Well, I guess somebody has to have passion for somebody has to design this and make this and shit

[3659.20s -> 3664.69s]  Those are the two shows that I combined chopped and shark tank. That's how fast this fucking brain goes

[3835.24s -> 3841.30s]  I imagine I'm gonna go to the dentist and tell them like that. You need your teeth fixed. Well, what happened?
[3841.30s -> 3852.05s]  Well, you know, I ate food from an easy bake oven that I undercooked. All right. All right, give me a minute
[3880.23s -> 3886.95s]  That was in my teeth and no wonder it like it's not coming out of this either
[3886.95s -> 3911.07s]  I have to run this through a dishwasher like four times and plug the oven. Why why it's fine
[3912.03s -> 3915.15s]  It's if the things meant to be turned on and it's gonna be preheated
[3922.02s -> 3927.53s]  This hot. All right, this is
[3928.33s -> 3938.22s]  We start with you. It's gonna take equal amount of time to clean these bowls to be ready cuz I
[3938.78s -> 3945.78s]  At some point you have to say who cares and like some of your brownies gonna taste like cheese. I
[3947.33s -> 3951.97s]  Can't hear him. Hello. This one's good. This was right

[4002.10s -> 4011.86s]  I'm right here. You know 2020 is always hindsight, right?
[4012.50s -> 4017.34s]  But I should have done this outside and just had like a hose somewhere that I could just spray into all this stuff and
[4017.34s -> 4019.34s]  To be ready to go

[4043.11s -> 4045.75s]  You are outside. I'm pretend outside
[4046.51s -> 4053.88s]  All right, at some point I'm gonna have to just kind of let this thing
[4054.72s -> 4059.72s]  Like it ain't gonna happen because and I'm gonna have to just use another bowl because I have another fresh one right there
[4065.71s -> 4076.90s]  No, it's coming up it's good it's gonna take a minute see the real smart person thing to do
[4077.54s -> 4079.54s]  Like have somebody hired
[4079.86s -> 4084.74s]  To have two bowl sets and one person's cleaning the bowls while I'm doing set number two. I
[4085.74s -> 4091.79s]  Need a fucking goddamn assistant what stop wiping us. Oh

[4098.63s -> 4103.59s]  This stuff is fucking acid. It's still coming up
[4104.11s -> 4110.69s]  Why it's like this?
[4111.33s -> 4123.78s]  Am I wiping off the dye on the bowl or is this still the sauce? Holy shit, that's loud
[4125.50s -> 4126.82s]  Gmod Mike
[4126.82s -> 4132.57s]  All right. I can go up there and I can turn it down and I'm gonna go do that. This is almost ready
[4132.65s -> 4137.84s]  So what am I making? You guys have seen what's up there? We got pretzels. I'm not making the pretzels right now
[4137.84s -> 4141.68s]  I don't want any more disgusting smelly like savory food that'll I'll gag
[4142.60s -> 4151.88s]  We got what do we got this brown? Yeah, there's brownies there. I actually I would eat the brownies
[4152.36s -> 4158.15s]  Real food is gross when it comes to toys. Okay, real food is disgusting
[4158.31s -> 4164.44s]  It nobody wants to eat like real food coming out of something like this
[4164.76s -> 4170.95s]  Nobody does but like candy and the cookies and stuff. That's fine
[4170.95s -> 4175.37s]  It's it's it's no nobody wants to eat like a fucking hot dog in an oven like this
[4175.87s -> 4180.93s]  guys sugar flour
[4181.09s -> 4185.29s]  Salt and baking soda is like what a cookie is made out of right?
[4185.41s -> 4189.99s]  But like if there was like hamburgers in here, I wouldn't want like powdered hamburger meat
[4189.99s -> 4195.61s]  I don't want to eat like powdered cheese. I don't eat like powdered marinara sauce
[4195.81s -> 4202.70s]  This other thing is a powdered tomato, okay, no such thing to make a brownie. It's just like chocolate powder
[4203.34s -> 4217.10s]  Sugar eggs salt. It's I'm not you know, it's not powdered tomatoes like that shit was okay
[4217.10s -> 4226.12s]  This is good to go. All right, that one's ready one more and we're done
[4226.42s -> 4234.98s]  Actually, I'm gonna take a second to just get this water cleared out and then we can keep going
[4234.98s -> 4242.10s]  I'd be yeah, I don't need like this one. This this was the most complicated one. I
[4242.62s -> 4266.16s]  Ain't spending 20 minutes cleaning that just get a new one forehead
[4266.66s -> 4270.86s]  Just get a new one. This is not the garbage bowl
[4271.06s -> 4286.90s]  Good point, but all pans are gonna have some like decay on them
[4286.90s -> 4301.55s]  You know what I mean? Like you're never gonna get a pan clean. Oh, no, you're never gonna get a pan fully clean like this
[4313.77s -> 4321.06s]  My whole body is on fire I
[4324.27s -> 4328.50s]  Fuck I went like this in my nail
[4329.14s -> 4343.84s]  Nail on a chalkboard like fuck. I just screamed in your ear. Okay, fucking whatever. Don't do it again. Ah
[4361.37s -> 4366.42s]  Give me a fucking easy one. Oh
[4366.94s -> 4384.82s]  Goddamn gotta get some elbow grease in it. That's how you get it done. Mm-hmm. Look at that. Fuck his brain
[4384.94s -> 4395.61s]  You saying fuck my brain or you saying like oh, no his brain. Alrighty. Are we ready for the next delicious treat?
[4395.61s -> 4403.45s]  I have to turn the microphone down garbage bowl. You're right
[4403.45s -> 4528.93s]  Those actually those are kind of good are we good so these two chocolate brownie mixes and two this this this is gonna be so much easier
[4528.93s -> 4537.52s]  Thank God. It's actually just two or three packets not like six. Thank God. All right chocolate brownie mix
[4537.52s -> 4547.67s]  Yeah, you get two of them just in case you want to go crazy
[4548.15s -> 4557.64s]  Yeah, this is gonna be so much better vanilla frosting mix. It's just two fucking things. Thank goodness
[4557.64s -> 4560.21s]  All right, clean as you go clean as you go
[4560.61s -> 4562.05s]  Thank goodness
[4562.05s -> 4571.99s]  All right, clean as you go clean as you go clean as you go clean as you go
[4572.23s -> 4586.36s]  Clean as you go turn the oven on. Oh shit. That would have been bad
[4586.64s -> 4597.38s]  All right. This one will be nice and quick. I think I don't even do I even need should I try to do one of these
[4597.38s -> 4599.70s]  Without the instructions like fuck it. Just do that
[4600.30s -> 4661.11s]  Dump brownie mix into the fucking container and then dump vanilla frosting into the container. I need water bowl
[4661.23s -> 4674.13s]  I'm about to throw that bowl in trash. You know what I mean?
[4674.17s -> 4681.30s]  Like I'm thinking about just putting that in it's thrown in the trash, but you can't I mean, it's like plastic
[4681.30s -> 4686.72s]  I can't do that. That's terrible. Okay, here we go chocolate brownie
[4688.40s -> 4690.40s]  Surprise, what's the surprise?
[4693.21s -> 4695.21s]  marinara sauce on the bottom
[4696.48s -> 4713.88s]  Okay, here we are one and a half teaspoons of water stir until it's nice and thick. Okay. Oh, this looks nice
[4713.88s -> 4721.21s]  I actually like the way this looks. Okay, it smells like just
[4721.97s -> 4725.63s]  hot-chocolate powder, which is like I
[4726.39s -> 4728.67s]  Let me tell you something
[4728.67s -> 4733.04s]  Nesquik cocoa powder just even like chocolate milk powder
[4733.16s -> 4735.16s]  Tell me if you guys think I'm a sick fuck for doing this
[4735.16s -> 4737.16s]  I guarantee some of you guys do it too
[4737.16s -> 4744.26s]  you just you stir in a little bit just like you know, maybe one tablespoon into your milk and you get it a little bit there and
[4744.30s -> 4750.18s]  Then you sprinkle on top a layer of powder on top of the milk
[4750.22s -> 4757.92s]  So it becomes this disgusting sludge and you take a sip after you let it wait sit on the top for about 10 to 20
[4757.92s -> 4761.88s]  seconds take a little sip and you suck up the wet powder and
[4762.96s -> 4770.88s]  And it's like I'm telling you try it if you don't if you I'm telling you actually this is good to have a big
[4770.88s -> 4781.25s]  Bowl. No, I don't I did do that. Yeah, I mean I don't do this anymore. I'm a grown man. All right
[4782.01s -> 4791.88s]  Okay, where's my stirring thing? This smells very good. This smells way better than powdered tomato sauce
[4791.92s -> 4798.46s]  All right, let's get our spatula and let's uh, let's work with it here. What do you say?
[4798.46s -> 4809.63s]  Okay, I'm trying to see yeah, let's actually move this out of the way LUL poop wine. It's chocolate. Oh, I get it
[4809.63s -> 4818.16s]  It's hey. Hey, it's it's brown in there. It must be poopoo. All right guys row up
[4818.16s -> 4834.51s]  How is this only need one and a half tablespoons of water?
[4838.88s -> 4845.76s]  Can somebody explain that to me because this is not even close. I need way more water than this
[4845.76s -> 4854.57s]  I think I might even need more than that
[4854.57s -> 4862.45s]  You need like a cup of water in here. You didn't add one and a half. What? Yes, I did
[4862.45s -> 4867.37s]  I'm gonna get in there
[4867.37s -> 4879.36s]  Imagine being a parent and having your kid asked to do this on a one on a given day
[4879.44s -> 4883.78s]  This is one of those things where you just don't want to hear those words
[4883.96s -> 4891.81s]  No, can't you like go outside and just like throw shit around why I don't want to do this
[4891.99s -> 4897.58s]  Who wants to do this what parent wants to actually have to go through the trouble with this shit?
[4897.58s -> 4901.71s]  They want you to make food
[4901.71s -> 4907.53s]  Why don't you make actual brownies like why do you need this weird little fucking bagel toaster?
[4907.57s -> 4914.40s]  Just make a brownie just make brownies in your oven in your actual oven. What's this for? What is this for?
[4914.40s -> 4923.65s]  I can't I was it for I don't get it. It's for kids. Okay, you kids can cook too, but you need supervision for this
[4924.70s -> 4925.86s]  caution
[4925.86s -> 4932.62s]  Supervision required so if you need supervision to use this you need supervision to use a real oven. So what's the pro?
[4932.62s -> 4937.78s]  I don't know. What's the deal? What's the problem? This actually looks pretty this looks pretty syrupy and pretty soupy
[4937.86s -> 4946.70s]  And pretty delicious it says mix concoction until it gets all syrupy and since savory and soupy. I got it there
[4946.82s -> 4956.02s]  All right, that looks good. Damn. This looks fucking good. I did a good job
[4956.02s -> 4961.30s]  I this is from scratch isn't me doing this shit from it's too loud might be okay now
[4961.30s -> 4969.10s]  We do the frosting easy-bake vanilla frosting. We'll do it in here. Wait, was this the one with the cheese in it?
[4969.10s -> 4996.49s]  Okay. Now what is going to do water cheese frosting? We don't do this yet. Okay, roll these mixtures into balls
[4996.49s -> 5018.66s]  I need to wait what already that might light on fire. I can't okay sprinkle flour on
[5018.66s -> 5032.15s]  Okay, so wait, this is supposed to be turned into a ball. That's not gonna turn into a ball. Hold on
[5039.51s -> 5042.39s]  Just eat it out of the fucking bowl
[5046.03s -> 5048.66s]  Wow
[5048.66s -> 5062.37s]  Okay, what are you supposed to cook this? Is this like rotten boy? Do I ain't supposed to cook that is it raw?
[5073.25s -> 5075.68s]  Oh
[5076.16s -> 5080.04s]  Smells in there it fucking stinks and it smells
[5082.04s -> 5084.04s]  College dorm room in here. Oh
[5087.41s -> 5105.75s]  No, I have to go to the dentist after this one, okay
[5105.83s -> 5111.08s]  So you can't eat it raw it has to be baked cuz it's not there could be this like raw cookie dough in there
[5111.08s -> 5117.49s]  I can fix this though because there's two of these I'm gonna add this very slowly
[5117.93s -> 5130.54s]  You know, you can make a mistake. You make a mistake or two. It's fine. It's okay to make us mistake
[5130.74s -> 5136.93s]  You can fix it in post. This is this is the video editing of the cooking world
[5136.93s -> 5147.12s]  You just add a little bit more powder slowly and get it in there until it's all syrupy and soupy and thick and savory
[5147.16s -> 5155.47s]  How am I ever gonna put this into a ball? Well, um, should I just spread this on there?
[5155.67s -> 5166.67s]  What if I just spread this onto the pan and make it like just on the pan and then put the frosting on top?
[5166.67s -> 5186.66s]  So it's just a big cake. What's wrong with that? It'll still work. This is not gonna turn into a ball, right?
[5186.70s -> 5198.75s]  No, how the fuck do people cook I swear to god chefs definitely just sit there while they're doing this and going like oh my god
[5198.75s -> 5204.43s]  This is fucking wrong. This is so wrong. This is the wrongest thing I've ever done. This is not fucking right
[5204.43s -> 5206.43s]  This is wrong and then like cut to the guy
[5206.75s -> 5211.20s]  Bringing it out and being like here is your salmon, sir. The chef prepared it fresh for you
[5211.20s -> 5222.78s]  I swear to god like this is this shit's impossible. This is impossible. I'm just making a chocolate bowl
[5229.41s -> 5246.47s]  Okay, okay. This is not I'm just gonna do the thing. I said I was gonna do let's try it
[5246.55s -> 5256.02s]  More powder, but I'm not gonna be able to even move it. What do you mean more powder?
[5256.02s -> 5293.78s]  This is like one of the things I'm too tall for which how does that make any sense now?
[5293.78s -> 5298.41s]  What remember this is for kids? Yeah
[5298.97s -> 5312.88s]  More powder make balls make balls. I'm not sure I can do that with this. It's just gonna fall apart. Look at this
[5312.88s -> 5320.30s]  It's it's it's too goopy. Don't put any more powder. Are you following the recipe?
[5320.30s -> 5324.30s]  Yeah, pour one chocolate brownie mix and add one and a half teaspoons of water
[5324.30s -> 5330.14s]  I think maybe that is I think that does need to be more powder, right?
[5330.18s -> 5340.23s]  I think so because they otherwise a teaspoon. Yeah, but it was I couldn't even work with it
[5340.23s -> 5354.62s]  It was so powdery. It was impossible. God. This is annoying. Just go to Dunkin Donuts. Just get one
[5354.62s -> 5374.72s]  They have like 60 balls. All right. Hold on. It's coming together. I might be able to actually turn this into a ball now
[5374.72s -> 5386.74s]  I'm only gonna make like a couple of these I think this is so all right
[5386.74s -> 5405.15s]  This is starting to get hard to do more powder. Are you sure? Yes. All right, I'm not putting any more
[5405.15s -> 5427.67s]  I'm not doing any more powder after this. This is it terrible. Oh my god
[5428.21s -> 5435.22s]  What is this even supposed to do? How do you fuck up to a one ingredient bag? I don't understand
[5435.22s -> 5439.98s]  I think I need the other tool. This is gonna be impossible
[5439.98s -> 5445.86s]  I think I gotta get in there with my hands, but I can't get in there with my oh, there we go
[5445.86s -> 5452.12s]  Look at that. I can scrape like I can scrape the bottom. All right. What do you think? Is it ready?
[5452.28s -> 5460.14s]  What do you think that looks a little frothy?
[5460.26s -> 5475.90s]  Maybe a little maybe a little bit more powder just a little bit spinning it you're making a lot of dad noises
[5476.38s -> 5490.74s]  Fuck and whatever. Okay. This is definitely ready. Maybe a little bit more powder. I don't know
[5490.78s -> 5493.85s]  I've never made brownies before guys. I don't know what it's supposed to look like
[5493.85s -> 5499.95s]  I was hoping that there would be pictures in here to show me. I think this is good
[5499.99s -> 5503.11s]  It's very it's very stringy. All right
[5503.11s -> 5505.67s]  I'm just gonna try to get a bunch of it and then I got a have it be a ball
[5505.99s -> 5515.82s]  Okay, and then and then what make it if that defeat? Oh, these are whoopie pies. These are not brownies
[5515.82s -> 5520.88s]  Why are you guys saying brownies whether whoopie pies? They're not supposed to be brownies
[5524.06s -> 5532.76s]  Okay, so we need to make two we're gonna make one. I'm only doing four
[5532.76s -> 5559.89s]  I'm doing one two and one two. Okay, how am I gonna do this turn on the oven?
[5559.89s -> 5562.82s]  The oven's on the oven is on the ovens powered on
[5565.13s -> 5572.71s]  Okay before I do this I gotta get this prepared. I gotta be ready for this. This is gonna be a disaster
[5572.71s -> 5592.10s]  I gotta be ready with this just right here waiting for me. I can't turn this into a ball into a ball
[5592.50s -> 5604.62s]  This is just how a child eats dessert. Okay, it's almost a ball
[5604.74s -> 5617.82s]  It's it's getting there and then I have to spread it out on here. Oh shit
[5635.74s -> 5639.89s]  Hershey's kisses instead. Okay, there's one
[5654.70s -> 5660.66s]  No, no the baby got on the counter and it's just eating the chocolate out of the bowl
[5660.94s -> 5669.53s]  This is the baby. This is the baby is on the counter Jared my husband. Where the fuck are you? What are you doing?
[5669.53s -> 5682.98s]  Why are you letting him do that? You're gonna let the baby eat on the counter. What are you fucking stupid? I don't oh, right
[5682.98s -> 5697.42s]  Sorry, hey get off that counter. I can make one you supposed to make a ball. Hold on

[5707.18s -> 5732.58s]  This is bad. This is bad. I feel like people are gonna people are gonna share this clip. Oh damn it
[5732.58s -> 5746.10s]  I can't make a ball needs more powder. I think there's no way I can do this
[5748.41s -> 5765.05s]  Barf it said use your hands
[5769.11s -> 5776.95s]  I have to like spend an hour cleaning this up. Okay, I have we're gonna do an open-faced turkey sandwich type

[5790.06s -> 5799.69s]  I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm doing. I'll try as hard as I can to get one other ball
[5812.97s -> 5821.68s]  Smoke wait get that out of there. Okay, this is new plan new plan new plan new plan

[5834.58s -> 5852.73s]  What there's only one way out of this I to eat my way out
[5852.77s -> 5880.98s]  There's only one way out of this don't laugh if I laugh it's gonna go fucking everywhere. Don't fucking laugh focus
[5881.32s -> 5917.06s]  Focus I could have to move you guys. I can't fucking I just stop eating this what I'm stuck

[5925.24s -> 5932.66s]  I can't go anywhere. I literally can't move. I'm gonna have to sit here for the rest of my life
[5932.70s -> 5970.86s]  Is there an easy one in here just save scum I wish is there an answer an easy one
[5970.86s -> 5973.86s]  I okay. I'm making this I'm gonna do the frosting. I'm not giving up on this one
[5973.86s -> 5977.58s]  I still I got a dollop on there. We're gonna make a fucking brownie with extra frosting on it
[5977.58s -> 5986.25s]  I just have to not have this all over me. I'm I'm like in trouble
[5986.25s -> 6005.50s]  I have to pick this up with my mouth. Why did I pick this up with my fucking hands? What a joke?
[6005.50s -> 6021.67s]  What an idiot dope this thing this thing's like preheated
[6021.67s -> 6037.02s]  Well, hope you like a guy that is 35 years old almost that is stuck in his chair
[6038.07s -> 6044.81s]  Because he couldn't figure out how to do the brownies on the easy bake oven and now he is actually
[6045.41s -> 6051.16s]  Fucked because he can't move and now I have to like go wash my body. I have to go take a shower
[6051.32s -> 6063.35s]  They're not brownies. Whatever. We'll see what they are when they come out of the oven
[6063.35s -> 6073.01s]  I need a cupcake pan that doesn't say that on there. It says put them on the tray click the link
[6073.09s -> 6082.47s]  Oh, yeah, click the link. Let me just reach for my mouse and grab it. Yeah, I can't do that right now
[6082.47s -> 6089.23s]  I told you I'm stuck forever. All right. I'm good. Here we go. I'll be right back. Okay now
[6089.23s -> 6094.97s]  I'm now I'm at that point where I can literally clean myself up disaster
[6094.97s -> 6106.45s]  Why would I fucking do this with my hands? I should have I should have now that's a thought
[6106.49s -> 6114.62s]  No, that's a thought in this guy right here
[6114.62s -> 6129.88s]  I can wake a ball in my mouth and then just like off-camera just put it on there. No, what do you mean?
[6129.92s -> 6137.57s]  What I'm gonna like form it in my mouth like and then just spit it out. I'll don't do that
[6137.57s -> 6144.17s]  Don't there's an audio delay. How is there an audio delay? I have one. I'll like here
[6144.17s -> 6155.06s]  I'll just I just we have one we have a whoopie pie. It's done. All right, I have to get okay
[6155.06s -> 6158.52s]  This is gonna be weird. I can't grab this but this is gonna be
[6159.40s -> 6160.72s]  This it's gonna be loud
[6160.72s -> 6165.00s]  So just turn your volume down because I'm gonna literally just like wily coyote yank this off my head
[6165.00s -> 6328.23s]  This is why cooking sucks
[6328.31s -> 6336.80s]  Okay, because it's just a shitload of cleaning you clean for like six times more than you cook you cook for like six minutes
[6336.80s -> 6349.00s]  And you clean for like two hours. This is my cooking sucks. All right, I'm gonna make the frosting time for the frosting
[6349.00s -> 6353.47s]  Okay, cool. I think preheated nice very very nice
[6367.10s -> 6369.30s]  I'm gonna have to put them all in the same bowl. I
[6371.73s -> 6376.84s]  I'll click it. I'll click it. Give me I'll fix the volume too. Just give me one sec
[6377.00s -> 6384.99s]  You know, it's like kind of remarkable I've not gotten a single damn thing
[6385.93s -> 6394.99s]  Anywhere anywhere, but right here. That's that's remarkable. Okay frosting time after I click on the link
[6394.99s -> 6397.87s]  I'll take a break
[6397.87s -> 6421.22s]  Hold on a second. Like this is through the cookies. Hi, where's the link? You got a link for me?
[6421.30s -> 6455.19s]  Whoa, I can't you doing it too fast. You're doing it way too fast. I can't even click it. Holy shit
[6455.23s -> 6463.98s]  Oh my god, that looks horrible. No, it looks like I got like an a hockey fight. Oh
[6465.61s -> 6476.10s]  How many more of these are there? That's that's the wrong one. What do you mean wrong one?
[6476.10s -> 6510.69s]  I can't spray the cupcakes that doesn't that's not on my book. That's not on my book. Read that. That's not a cupcake pan
[6510.69s -> 6532.62s]  Oh, I'd special pan place the six flat cakes on the sprayed baking pan. I got scammed. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever
[6532.62s -> 6537.92s]  That's fine. Any more pictures you want me to look at before I go fucking ruin my reputation as an adult human being
[6538.14s -> 6561.36s]  Yeah, I saw that one. I'm back to it. You bought home on you're going too fast
[6561.60s -> 6567.23s]  You bought the easy bake up instead of the easy cupcake oven. That's a lie easy fake oven. Whatever
[6567.25s -> 6590.70s]  So I got I got sorry. It's a so it's fucked up. Who cares? All right, I'm going back over there any scraps for me
[6590.88s -> 6617.99s]  Could you see me? Could you see my face? Yeah. Okay. Hey wish I had the cupcake pan. Don't you?
[6622.10s -> 6629.14s]  That was disgusting just leave just go go trust me just go yeah, that's that's the end this
[6629.74s -> 6641.22s]  See you later. That was back there. You're free to go. You are I need my instructions. No, I don't even need my instructions
[6641.22s -> 6647.24s]  It's water that I don't have any water
[6715.25s -> 6722.21s]  Yeah, cuz I just pretended to blow a snot into the food like I would have left I would have been like, okay
[6722.21s -> 6728.68s]  This who else does somebody else has to be fucking streaming. I have to do this whole thing in here
[6728.68s -> 6731.64s]  I don't know about that. This is a lot
[6755.72s -> 6766.96s]  What's next? Oh, I'm supposed to cook this sure. Okay, so just put it in
[6770.10s -> 6781.53s]  There's only one but whatever what am I gonna do about it? How long well fucking minutes in no way
[6781.85s -> 6796.69s]  It's definitely not 12 minutes not for one. I know. All right, let's make the fraud
[6796.69s -> 6807.80s]  This is gonna be the delicious part. I am excited for this one. Oh, yeah
[6809.01s -> 6819.41s]  Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah smell that smell that one. That's just like a vanilla powder
[6819.73s -> 6831.08s]  Okay, do I don't I don't need to make that much frosting for one little cake. This is too much frosting
[6831.48s -> 6837.69s]  This is gonna be the most savory I can't wait look just say words that have to do with food
[6837.69s -> 6840.93s]  And people will think you know what you're talking about. All right, that's one's done
[6845.34s -> 6848.61s]  That's food. We need some water
[6849.17s -> 6867.28s]  How much water one and a half teaspoons? I think that's it right and then mix it up
[6867.28s -> 6888.84s]  I get I gotta move the vomit ball out of the way. Okay, here we go. So I'm not gonna add any more water
[6888.84s -> 6896.14s]  I'm not gonna be a psycho about this. It's not really as you can see it's mix it faster
[6896.46s -> 6901.25s]  No, that's not how you don't mix it faster is not better. So low it's slow and slow
[6902.60s -> 6912.59s]  Time on that one time on this one. What was it? Why when did I put it in nine minutes left? Okay
[6912.59s -> 6944.17s]  I don't want to make a fucking mess faster faster. What the fuck? This is frosting
[6944.77s -> 6947.70s]  vanilla frosting
[6947.70s -> 6959.09s]  This doesn't look like frosting
[6959.17s -> 6971.16s]  Did I do too much fucking water again? I did a teaspoon. I did it this time. It had one and a half. You saw me
[6971.68s -> 6974.58s]  No, no, no, no, no. No, this is this is reducing
[6975.16s -> 6980.22s]  Hey, this is this is reducing. There's another one of those cooking words that they say on Food Network
[6980.78s -> 7004.72s]  Yeah, okay. This is no look at it. Yeah, it's thickening up time on that. You're going too fast
[7005.32s -> 7016.02s]  You know, I need to I'm fucking knock this out of the way. Should I give it a taste?
[7016.28s -> 7018.60s]  What is it? What is it? What's it? What's it supposed to taste like?
[7019.84s -> 7023.66s]  Frosting. Yeah, this is looking like a glaze
[7024.26s -> 7030.77s]  Yeah, it looks alright. It's supposed to
[7032.05s -> 7033.49s]  Span that person
[7033.49s -> 7037.91s]  Ban that person, you know who you are and you know what you said ban them
[7037.91s -> 7042.85s]  I don't want to see their face ever again. I don't want to ever even I don't want to even hear them in this chat
[7043.17s -> 7048.06s]  You know what you said and you know who you are. Now you fucking being like holy shitty and talking about me
[7048.22s -> 7067.96s]  Yeah, ban them for at least a week. Maybe you'll learn your lesson. What do we got for time on that eight more minutes?
[7067.96s -> 7081.27s]  No, it's not. It's like four. All right. This is ready. This is nice and mixed. It's got a nice honey glaze
[7081.91s -> 7084.33s]  Consistency, it's nice gonna be a nice drizzle on our cake
[7084.95s -> 7105.37s]  What else do I have here? Oh look at this shit, but I don't like have I need to like or
[7105.75s -> 7111.57s]  Wait, what about the pretzels? Should I make the pretzels? I can make a pretty so I'm gonna make a huge pretzel
[7111.83s -> 7120.59s]  Yep. No who wants to eat these? Yeah, I'm gonna make a big pretzel. It's that one right there
[7123.02s -> 7142.67s]  Okay, I have this bowl. I have one two three three clean bowls time on that. Please. There's a time. No, what do you mean?
[7142.83s -> 7155.82s]  Hold on. Are we ready to reveal it? It's six minutes back to mixing
[7156.32s -> 7170.28s]  This is gonna be gross and a lot of people are gonna be grossed out by this
[7170.28s -> 7180.12s]  I guarantee you I have diarrhea in like three hours. I guarantee you think that's just a hot 100%
[7180.40s -> 7201.16s]  Time on that up. This thing freaks me out man. This thing freaks me the fuck out. Is this glue? No, it's
[7204.91s -> 7212.05s]  It's too thin. It's a no, maybe it's not maybe it's supposed to be like a
[7212.53s -> 7224.99s]  Like a nice little drizzle or something add more powder fine
[7225.17s -> 7247.82s]  I'll add a little bit more powder fine. That's enough put it down. Actually not a bad idea
[7247.82s -> 7261.02s]  That's it's starting to really thicken up a little bit here. You want to talk about peak inefficiency, by the way an entire
[7262.54s -> 7272.26s]  Two-two full packets of chocolate powder just 80% of it gone and there's one little dollop in there
[7272.28s -> 7282.94s]  Just absolute inefficiency. There's not you can't get more inefficient than what just happened
[7283.10s -> 7288.59s]  Although hold on a minute. I did put a big spoonful of my mouth from the beginning
[7288.59s -> 7290.11s]  So that was it that was one cake
[7290.11s -> 7296.84s]  I did one full cake in my mouth in the beginning and then I did like at least two cakes full licking it off of
[7296.84s -> 7304.50s]  My hands, right? So it wasn't a total waste maybe half of it 50% in efficiency. So I got an F still enough
[7304.50s -> 7316.55s]  All right. Yeah, that's definitely what it's supposed to be like. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[7316.55s -> 7327.27s]  Oh, yeah, there we go. Maybe even a little bit more take it out. Take it out. Take it out
[7327.35s -> 7331.22s]  How long has it been isn't it too long? All right, I'm gonna get it
[7331.22s -> 7337.34s]  I'm gonna get it out. How long has been take it out take it out. Oh shit. Hold on
[7337.34s -> 7344.86s]  I'm almost I gotta get a little thing. So it's too hot for me. It's burning. It's not fucking burning
[7344.86s -> 7362.65s]  Quit freaking me out. You guys are fucking with me. Is it out? Oh, dude
[7363.09s -> 7381.53s]  It actually looks pretty good. It actually looks kind of good. Take a look at this like I saw the bot
[7381.69s -> 7398.92s]  Okay, here it comes. Why is it such a pain in the ass to get out? Okay, hold on
[7398.92s -> 7400.92s]  I gotta get it out of there now
[7408.26s -> 7430.84s]  Get out of there get up give it to me. Oh my fucking
[7431.88s -> 7433.32s]  God
[7433.32s -> 7456.47s]  Yet it won't oh, okay. Here comes a big reveal. Take a look at that. Ah
[7460.38s -> 7484.64s]  Yep, it is puffy. It is crispy and it's ready for the frosting. It smells good. It is a little crispy
[7484.64s -> 7536.28s]  Yeah, that's alright though. You know when you
[7536.80s -> 7540.80s]  Take out your trash you take your trash out of the trash can the bag and
[7541.86s -> 7548.62s]  It's just like one item. That's always just at the very bottom of the trash can and you just look in
[7548.62s -> 7551.78s]  You know, you see it there all the time, you know, it's in there, but you don't ever fucking grab it
[7551.78s -> 7567.22s]  You don't take it out. This is the item that's just at the bottom of the trash can it's hard as a rock
[7567.70s -> 7575.27s]  You ready to hear this? It's gonna be like hard candy. Why what happened? I did I told you it was in there for too long
[7578.18s -> 7596.34s]  A yummy whoopie pie. Holy shit. This is good. This is good way better than the pizza
[7596.34s -> 7610.32s]  Oh, dude, don't go rules dude. Don't go rules, dude. Are you kidding me? It's don't go rules

[7625.58s -> 7635.89s]  Holy shit, that's perfect. Well, I wish I had more
[7636.69s -> 7639.42s]  Then the joke from the Disney
[7640.42s -> 7647.66s]  Donald's goofy and Mickey Mouse cartoon where they were sharing one single bean and slicing it off like bread
[7647.66s -> 7652.74s]  I don't know Jack and the beanstalk. What is it called? What was that? What was that? What was it called?
[7652.74s -> 7665.50s]  It was a Jack and the Beanstalk. They were slicing one bean like a bread. It was bread. Wait, was it bread?
[7665.50s -> 7671.56s]  Oh, no, they had they were slicing bread like paper thin. What was the bean? No, they did it to a bean too
[7671.76s -> 7682.19s]  Okay, let's make a pretzel. Mmm. I think I'm I got I got clean bowls here
[7682.19s -> 7689.72s]  Let's see what it takes. Let me make sure I get this ready to go. I enjoyed my I enjoyed
[7689.92s -> 7703.83s]  Yeah delicious delicious free sample at the mall now. Let's uh that for what I had though. That was really good
[7703.83s -> 7705.16s]  You know, it's suck
[7705.16s -> 7708.88s]  So bad is that's so good and the free sample of the ball is always so good
[7708.92s -> 7716.22s]  But then when you actually get the food, it's not so good when you take that free sample that they oh here free sample
[7716.22s -> 7718.78s]  And you're like, hmm, holy shit. This is I'm this is best thing I've ever had in my life
[7718.78s -> 7724.37s]  You get the actual entree that that is it's like a 7 out of 10. I hate that shit
[7724.41s -> 7730.31s]  It's so annoying like I just I want to buy the tray like I want to go up to the people that have the trays
[7730.31s -> 7734.56s]  Of the samples and be like can I order can I just buy the tray now from you?
[7734.56s -> 7745.86s]  I'll pay twice for what the actual entree is for that's a that's a psychopath test. All right. Well, then I'm a psycho
[7745.86s -> 7757.82s]  Whatever. This is gonna go. I still got water here, which is good. Probably gonna need it
[7757.82s -> 7767.15s]  I can clean that up. Let's do the pretzel. It's because the sample people don't know how to do it
[7767.15s -> 7775.69s]  What do you mean chug the frosting? No, no, I'll shit my pants
[7775.73s -> 7810.39s]  I really will I feel like I'm about to take like medicine something about it. I can't I can't do it
[7810.39s -> 7816.12s]  I can't do something about it. I can't do that something about it
[7816.12s -> 7823.90s]  So I can't do it something about how that is that I want it
[7823.90s -> 7830.20s]  If you know if you put that in a Dunkaroos container, I'll eat it. It's not a dunker
[7830.20s -> 7840.11s]  It's not in a Dunkaroos container. No, I keep trying. I keep trying to just psych myself out and do it. It's just sugar
[7840.51s -> 7858.07s]  What's the problem? It's fucking fine. It's sugar. No, it's not. Yes. It is. Just fuck up. It's fine. It's not fine
[7858.11s -> 7872.87s]  It's gross actually is kind of gross without the Dunkaroos aspect of it. All right, let's go trash container right here
[7874.46s -> 7878.54s]  We'll move this out of the way for now. I'll have to clean this up later. All right, it's time for pretzel
[7878.78s -> 7884.67s]  It's pretzel. Hopefully pretzels not that hopefully you don't need a bunch of bullshit for the pretzel turn the oven off
[7886.46s -> 7888.10s]  Okay, fine. I
[7888.10s -> 7893.85s]  Am going to try my hardest and we've been here for a couple hours for two three hours
[7894.01s -> 7899.87s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can to make this the way that it looks on the actual package
[7900.07s -> 7904.32s]  Like I'm I have to do one that look that is correct
[7904.64s -> 7909.46s]  Have to if I'm gonna prove anything here. I need to be ready
[7909.46s -> 7918.76s]  I need I want to brush my teeth so bad clean the tray
[7918.76s -> 7923.80s]  I will let me just see what the damage is here. This isn't this is an elaborate one. It's got like holy shit
[7924.60s -> 7928.88s]  This is so he's so many packets in here. Oh
[7930.24s -> 7931.44s]  boy
[7931.44s -> 7936.95s]  Okay, this is just salt. This is egg wash
[7938.92s -> 7940.92s]  nacho cheese sauce
[7942.66s -> 7951.87s]  Pretzel mix two pretzel mixes is there three? Okay. Am I ready for this?
[7952.43s -> 7959.12s]  Let me at least hold on. Let me at least get these other bowls because I'm gonna need one two
[7959.64s -> 7965.23s]  Three four one, two, three. I'm gonna need four bowls. Let me clean this one out and let me wash this tray
[7965.63s -> 7970.56s]  my mother's probably
[7970.56s -> 7972.34s]  Freaking out right now
[7972.34s -> 7979.82s]  You know, you guys like a backseat game, you know both backseat gamers on twitch. My mother is loves to bake
[7980.02s -> 7983.82s]  She's really into it. She is probably backseat gaming right now
[7983.82s -> 7990.84s]  So hard like I I did like I fell off the cliff like four times to my mother right now right now
[7990.84s -> 7992.76s]  She's just like what is he doing with his hands?
[7992.76s -> 7994.32s]  No, what do you what are you dumb?
[7994.32s -> 8001.54s]  Like he's he are you are you pretending to not know how to do this Jeremy? And she's like, oh my I just said that
[8002.06s -> 8020.33s]  All right. Do I need what do I need for pretzel nuggets? No, I'm doing the loop. All right, I can do this one
[8020.33s -> 8023.36s]  Let me clean up the area. Let me clean this out
[8026.30s -> 8033.00s]  Try as hard as I can for this like this is you think that you like me trying to beat like Jevil for the first
[8033.00s -> 8035.88s]  Take the first try. No, I'm gonna get this first try. I'm gonna try as hard as I can
[8036.04s -> 8042.44s]  I'm gonna be fucking silent try harding the whole time. I'm gonna be dead silent
[8042.96s -> 8045.04s]  quiet I
[8045.04s -> 8049.29s]  Said I'm gonna be silent try harding this because I want to be sure I get at the first try
[8049.77s -> 8057.70s]  These are just gonna have to be cleaned later because that shit ain't gonna happen right now
[8071.87s -> 8077.76s]  Speed run speed run easy big oven. That's not gonna work. You're sweating. I know I'm sweating
[8078.44s -> 8085.94s]  Wouldn't you be in this scenario? If you want me think about it
[8086.18s -> 8090.58s]  There's over 11,000 people here watching me not be able to do children's baking toy
[8090.78s -> 8093.10s]  Do you don't think that you would be sweating just a little here?
[8093.46s -> 8111.82s]  There is like a baseball stadium full of people watching me like burn cupcakes. It's good
[8134.72s -> 8138.37s]  It's just sugar Jeremy, don't worry, it's not gonna hurt you
[8139.45s -> 8153.32s]  Ego maniac and then I will return in
[8154.28s -> 8176.09s]  Two minutes I'll be back in one or two minutes to keep going we eat this we eat this shit
[8177.59s -> 8184.76s]  We eat this this we eat this we shouldn't be eating this stuff
[8184.76s -> 8189.22s]  We shouldn't be eating this just to get a juice or a juice kale
[8189.84s -> 8192.20s]  Cucumbers and like pineapples and shit. Don't eat this stuff
[8405.78s -> 8411.38s]  I still taste the marinara sauce
[8416.76s -> 8423.70s]  Even after eating like two other things I can still taste it. It's like embedded into my gums
[8424.14s -> 8431.19s]  Alright, here we go. Time to make the pretzel. I'm gonna make this one count. I'm not gonna fuck around here
[8432.30s -> 8436.42s]  Pretzel time. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready to give this a fucking hundred percent
[8437.18s -> 8445.41s]  Alright, let's get this thing cooking. Uh-huh. No, it's try hard time
[8445.57s -> 8450.60s]  This is gonna be the best if this is not one of the best pretzels
[8450.60s -> 8456.60s]  You've ever seen somebody make with an easy bake oven. I will give
[8456.80s -> 8460.96s]  I don't know
[8462.20s -> 8463.12s]  50 subs
[8463.12s -> 8466.03s]  I'll give you 50 community so I'll give 50 community subs
[8466.07s -> 8472.27s]  If this is not like at least like a 5 or 6 out of 10 if this is not a 5 or 6 out of 10
[8472.27s -> 8484.33s]  I will promise. Okay. Here we go. That means I'm gonna do this right one egg wash mix. Let's go
[8484.95s -> 8488.18s]  Let's fucking go. You know what?
[8574.41s -> 8579.86s]  Ah, it's too loud for me
[8656.20s -> 8688.49s]  Don't that's bad. Yeah
[8689.05s -> 8690.49s]  next is
[8690.49s -> 8708.30s]  Pretzel mix looked over there on that screen and I thought that this bowl was a fire
[8708.30s -> 8710.80s]  I looked at the preview and I thought that was a fire
[8711.16s -> 8735.53s]  If this is this one, I don't like this one. Give me another one. This one's fucked up. No too contaminated
[8735.81s -> 8750.69s]  It's like a fucking sandbag. Come on
[8751.29s -> 8790.30s]  This
[8790.58s -> 8820.05s]  Three four
[8821.13s -> 8836.00s]  To a ball
[8836.00s -> 8839.86s]  Okay, what kind of pretzel do you want to make? I don't know how to make a pretzel actually
[8839.86s -> 8930.52s]  I don't know how to make a pretzel now what it's gonna be good. I need a little I'm what I think anymore water
[8930.52s -> 8941.27s]  I don't know. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope
[8941.55s -> 8968.06s]  Bingo use a bit more water
[8968.06s -> 8971.50s]  I'm only gonna use water just get it a little wet so I can use my hands with it
[8971.58s -> 8974.20s]  Just like they do with the fucking restaurants
[8974.56s -> 8996.76s]  Here we go, is it blood in this am I bleeding? Oh shit, is it? No, I'm not. All right
[9105.06s -> 9112.43s]  It's a fish. What are you talking? I haven't even spoken
[9113.23s -> 9118.97s]  loud for me
[9118.97s -> 9133.85s]  This sucks
[9133.85s -> 9143.06s]  Get that fucking liquid in there. That's what the problem is
[9143.06s -> 9146.42s]  It's not a fucking liquid in there get it in there work it in there go
[9147.22s -> 9197.04s]  What's a pretzel do? It's very finicky. Hold on. This one's a much better piece. All right. All right. All right
[9197.40s -> 9205.69s]  This is this one's this is the one to use fuck this one sucks. This is the one we're using
[9206.33s -> 9221.32s]  Okay, here we go. How do you how do you do it?
[9221.84s -> 9249.12s]  Dad twist it. I can't
[9249.92s -> 9253.25s]  it's
[9253.25s -> 9255.09s]  That just scared me
[9255.09s -> 9262.59s]  Okay, then it goes
[9262.59s -> 9273.84s]  twisted like this
[9303.52s -> 9322.18s]  He's going crazy. All right, that's good. That's good. That's good. Look at that. What do you think?
[9322.74s -> 9327.89s]  What do you think? You're a psycho
[9328.69s -> 9335.15s]  That's pretty pogchamp. It is
[9335.83s -> 9337.79s]  It actually is
[9337.79s -> 9343.14s]  Like that's very that's good. This is well done. That's at least a five
[9343.92s -> 9346.96s]  That's a fucking five five. That's a goddamn five
[9347.78s -> 9349.67s]  Ain't that a five?
[9349.67s -> 9364.97s]  All right now shut this up. I can't fucking I just did like a monkey. Let's just cook this just because
[9385.54s -> 9390.87s]  This music doesn't it's fucking freaking me out
[9391.79s -> 9413.43s]  Bake is this on is it on? No, you don't solve you salt after salt after you don't solve yet
[9413.43s -> 9420.80s]  you salt after make the glaze make the dough glaze it and then
[9421.48s -> 9424.94s]  Make the cheese
[9424.94s -> 9428.65s]  salt it salt now
[9429.37s -> 9431.10s]  Salt it now
[9431.10s -> 9446.68s]  Should I should I actually solve the directions? Don't say anything about salt. I don't see anything about salt. Oh shit
[9446.68s -> 9448.68s]  Yeah, it does. Okay, I gotta be careful
[9448.84s -> 9469.52s]  That's that's fine. That's not none of that. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's not that's that's perfect
[9469.84s -> 9471.60s]  All right, get it in the oven
[9471.60s -> 9531.22s]  Here we go. It's too big. Come on. Don't do this to me now. All right, get it in there 12 minutes
[9531.74s -> 9539.35s]  The shits on right?
[9601.30s -> 9624.66s]  Death
[9630.05s -> 9636.05s]  The rest of these look real complicated I'm willing to open them and see we've already done this one fuck this thing
[9636.41s -> 9646.10s]  I'm giving I'm giving this thing to my niece. Anyways, she's gonna. Oh wait the cheese sauce. What about the cheese sauce, dude?
[9646.58s -> 9656.01s]  Make the cheese dip. No, I don't want to make that. You know how bad this is gonna smell
[9656.01s -> 9666.77s]  I refuse to make this just the smell alone from opening this would would probably make me gag
[9666.93s -> 9676.65s]  Dermot's the worst uncle but a free easy bake oven with some fucking cool toys and some awesome recipes
[9676.65s -> 9690.67s]  This makes me a bad uncle. What are you smoking? Keep an eye on that. That's bread in there. We're making bread tonight
[9690.67s -> 9700.19s]  All right. Well, I mean it might as well. Yep. That's exactly what I thought it was gonna be
[9700.23s -> 9704.58s]  You know the inside, you know the Kraft macaroni and cheese the cheese packet
[9704.66s -> 9728.48s]  We're gonna be eating this shit in ten years. Anyway, 20 years from now real foods are gonna be
[9729.16s -> 9735.06s]  Hard to come by like digging a powdered food is gonna be the actually what we're eating that in bugs
[9735.72s -> 9748.90s]  Fifty years from now, we're gonna be eating bugs and powdered milk. Okay, just one with two teaspoons water. That's true. Yeah
[9748.90s -> 9763.35s]  I know I'm completely aware time what we got for a time. It must be 12 minutes everything
[9763.35s -> 9771.04s]  Why is everything 12 minutes too, right? That's it. Maybe one little bit
[9771.04s -> 9777.54s]  Yeah, maybe if I didn't have such huge ass balls
[9777.74s -> 9786.24s]  This wouldn't be a problem because all I'm effectively doing is just getting it all over the place
[9786.40s -> 9789.98s]  This is supposed to be a cheese sauce
[9790.18s -> 9810.25s]  Why did I open the why did I open this package? Why did I open the package? Why did I open this package? It stinks
[9810.73s -> 9823.16s]  This is not even a sauce. This is more like a solid than it is a sauce. I just fucked it up
[9823.16s -> 9841.76s]  I just fucking ruined it. Would you eat this? Would you eat this? Would you eat it?
[9841.76s -> 9859.67s]  I mean it kind of is like a dip. It's supposed to be a cheese
[9860.67s -> 9869.58s]  I can't even fucking imagine man going to like a Super Bowl party. Well, what do you got there? Oh, well
[9870.30s -> 9876.30s]  We've got cheese dip. Yeah, we've got a little bit of gravy left from Thanksgiving last year
[9876.58s -> 9880.28s]  we've got a sour dough dough and
[9880.96s -> 9883.98s]  Water like that. This is this is not enough
[9884.56s -> 9891.77s]  What a feast
[9891.77s -> 9896.72s]  Okay, seriously
[9896.76s -> 9901.88s]  This is the type of shit you get mad when your bowl looks like this when it's still when it comes out of the
[9901.88s -> 9905.45s]  Dishwasher like that. It's like fuck man. That's not clean
[9907.75s -> 9916.22s]  Bullshit, that's unbelievable. This is post dishwasher angry not cheese dip
[9917.91s -> 9925.52s]  Speaking of post dishwasher angry. I'm gonna have a lot of fun cleaning this shit up. I don't want to eat this
[9925.72s -> 9939.69s]  What's the time cheese dick? This is oh
[9940.21s -> 9956.59s]  Can you imagine like being in line at lunch it's like nachos is on the menu Wow nachos we never have nachos
[9957.23s -> 9959.59s]  Little lunch ladies. Just like yeah
[9962.11s -> 9988.18s]  Okay, who's next for the cheese that's when you just skip and you just go to the fucking meatball sub add more water
[9989.00s -> 10001.12s]  I need time on that. You thought you thought I was gonna do it. Oh that I didn't even know how it happened
[10001.16s -> 10004.51s]  It's like I was holding a bug in my hand and I looked down and it was gone
[10004.51s -> 10021.13s]  It just freaked me out because I didn't know what the bug was four minutes cool
[10021.77s -> 10027.44s]  This is no, this is probably the Lunchables cheese. I think is probably better than this
[10057.31s -> 10062.71s]  How has it become less is what I don't understand how did it's dip it's
[10063.35s -> 10087.20s]  Disappearing should I should I go for it? No earwax. Oh now I now you know, I can't do it
[10087.20s -> 10102.58s]  I'm taking it out. Why is every single one of these?
[10102.70s -> 10106.74s]  Let me give me give you a rundown of what the last three hours has been the last three hours has been I
[10107.30s -> 10113.40s]  make this gross shit and then sit there over the course of three recipes and
[10114.24s -> 10143.70s]  Try to eat a huge amount of the gross thing. I've done it like four times. You gotta go all in still there
[10153.68s -> 10158.17s]  That was the grossest thing. I think I've done in probably the last five years. I'm not even kidding
[10158.17s -> 10159.97s]  That's probably the gross thing. I've done in the last three years
[10159.97s -> 10165.92s]  Does it taste like cheese it tastes?
[10166.36s -> 10174.22s]  Like I feel like a cat just puked in my mouth and then somebody just sprayed
[10174.54s -> 10184.04s]  Like I can't believe it's not butter up my nose. That's kind of what it feels like. Is it ready?
[10184.48s -> 10206.15s]  It's ready. Is it time one minute. I'll tell you guys a story of how I
[10207.19s -> 10211.91s]  Never in my whole life. I've ever puked from looking at food or smelling food
[10211.91s -> 10216.99s]  I really haven't I haven't but one time I did one time
[10217.27s -> 10222.88s]  there was in the so my mother made eggs and bacon and like a breakfast spread, right and
[10223.76s -> 10228.96s]  After a few hours, you know, obviously it's like, okay, like it's clean it up put it everything in the sink and
[10230.28s -> 10234.00s]  Okay, we've got like there were there were dirty plates in there because we didn't have a dishwasher
[10235.04s -> 10237.20s]  at the time, I don't think and
[10237.20s -> 10245.34s]  in the sink with all like the dirty kind of breakfast plates was this one dirty plate that had eggs on it still just
[10246.35s -> 10248.15s]  like curdled up
[10248.15s -> 10254.62s]  Scrambled eggs wet and cold and it smelled like gross eggs and I threw up like I threw up directly
[10254.90s -> 10267.88s]  Into the sink on top of the eggs is the only times ever happen. Oh shit. No, I puked from Oreos, but no
[10267.88s -> 10273.38s]  I was sick though. That's a lie. It's not a lie. I was sick though. I was not sick for this story
[10273.38s -> 10277.56s]  That's not a that's a that's not a fake story. It's a real story. All right, here we go. You ready?
[10277.56s -> 10335.76s]  That's I wish I had some cheese dip. Ah shit. Ah, fuck. It's so bad. It smells rotten
[10335.96s -> 10349.59s]  50 subs but before but I that's not fair because I had to squish it because it wasn't it couldn't fit in here
[10349.71s -> 10365.17s]  All right, 50 subs fine. All right, fine 50 subs you get it
