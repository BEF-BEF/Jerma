[20.98s -> 42.74s]  What are these tags? What? Tags. Where do you see tags? English tournament arc. Dislikes goat cheese.
[42.74s -> 63.86s]  The sus guy. Have I ever had a tag on this stream besides English? I hate that the sus guy is on here
[63.86s -> 70.63s]  because I feel like people really probably type that in and I don't want him finding me like that.
[71.35s -> 84.23s]  These were added last stream. That's funny. We should change it to not the sus guy. Not the sus guy.
[84.23s -> 89.90s]  Stop asking. So people feel like, wait, he probably gets this a lot. This must be really annoying for
[89.90s -> 100.26s]  him. He probably gets that a lot. Anyways, hi. How are you? Good to see you. Gonna be playing
[100.26s -> 105.30s]  a video game today. I don't know why I think that's, I don't know. I don't know what's wrong
[105.30s -> 115.53s]  with me lately. Gonna be playing Disc Room today. It's a fun game. Somebody said, hey,
[115.53s -> 120.33s]  you probably found this because it was on Game Pass. Yes, that is exactly where I found it.
[121.05s -> 125.45s]  I played it on Game Pass for like five minutes and said, this seems like it's something I would
[125.45s -> 130.52s]  want to play and stream and have fun and just hang out. That's what we're going to do. Also,
[130.52s -> 136.44s]  I want to talk about something really quickly. Some very exciting news. I'm incredibly excited.
[137.53s -> 140.09s]  I will wait because I feel like a lot of you probably know what I'm going to talk about
[140.09s -> 152.76s]  already. We'll see. We'll give it a few minutes. I want people to know this. I have to tweet still,
[152.76s -> 185.70s]  so give me one second. I'll be right back. All right. You guys ready? I think we,
[186.26s -> 190.10s]  maybe another minute or so. I'll talk about it a few more times over the stream. It's not like I'm
[190.10s -> 200.07s]  not going to say it ever again. This coming week, you will be able to see me on Ranboo's
[201.88s -> 209.50s]  generation loss streams. I'm going to be playing a pretty major part.
[214.20s -> 227.96s]  I have an accent, but yeah, I'm really excited for it. It's been something that's been in the
[227.96s -> 234.87s]  works for a very long time. I cannot wait to see the whole thing play out because it is a three-day
[234.95s -> 250.94s]  event, May 24th, May 26th, and May 28th, 6 PM Eastern time. I'm going to be in it. You'll see.
[252.25s -> 259.45s]  I don't want to give anything away, but you'll see. Can you teach us how to beat box?
[262.52s -> 274.07s]  Yeah, sure. First, you go like this. Then you go like this. It's fucking easy. When are you going
[274.07s -> 279.83s]  to play Tears of the Kingdom? Never. Let's just get that out of the way. I want to say that because
[279.83s -> 284.23s]  then if I ever do play it, you'll be surprised. But if I don't ever play it, then I already told
[284.23s -> 293.32s]  you I wasn't. So let's just say that because then you're not expecting it. But who knows?
[297.88s -> 304.38s]  Yeah, a ton of time, a ton of efforts gone into this. I don't want to talk too much about it
[304.38s -> 311.62s]  because it's a very, very interesting, very intricate project. Just know I will be participating.
[311.62s -> 321.02s]  I cannot wait. It's going to be fun. We'll probably have the mods put up a sus for it.
[321.58s -> 328.25s]  Don't make promises you can't keep. Oh, I absolutely can make the promise that I'm
[328.25s -> 334.18s]  not going to play Tears of the Kingdom. I can promise you that, right? But like if it happens,
[334.18s -> 343.58s]  then whoa, what? It's Tears of the Kingdom. He's here. And I'll do a huge, elaborate, annoying intro
[344.97s -> 352.25s]  where I dress as Link and it's a full cam. And it's like, I play the song and it's like,
[352.25s -> 356.71s]  oh my God, he's going to play it. We'll make a whole thing out of it.
[368.87s -> 377.70s]  And I'll bring up the the Ocarina and I'll learn a bunch of songs for the Ocarina.
[377.70s -> 384.30s]  Dude, do you hate this game? Why? I'm not mocking it. I'm not. I'm not mocking. What are you talking
[384.30s -> 393.43s]  about? No, I don't. What am I mocking? No, I'm not mocking. This is not mocking. This is just
[393.43s -> 402.62s]  fucking around. I'm not. I'm not mocking. This dude hates Zelda. No, I don't. I'm not mocking.
[403.26s -> 419.48s]  The Ocarina is pretty easy to learn. Can you stop stalling and just survive the discs already?
[420.97s -> 426.89s]  Yeah, I get a few minutes. This is me time right now. I said this last stream too. This is me time.
[432.57s -> 439.22s]  My intros, the first 10 to 15 minutes of every stream, this is me time. This is me. This is for
[439.22s -> 453.35s]  me. But interrupting. Turn your cam on and do the rump shake. That's like kind of funny, but no,
[453.35s -> 475.54s]  not today. Just starts working. Not today. I don't know. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll do a
[475.54s -> 481.54s]  rump shake just like Tears of the Kingdom. I'm not planning on it. I don't have a plan to play Tears
[481.54s -> 493.05s]  of the Kingdom, but you might get a rump shake one day. You never know. Please don't. Don't. Don't
[493.05s -> 507.16s]  do it. I don't even know what that means. Does that mean what I think it does? Like just, I'm
[507.16s -> 511.88s]  just going to shake my ass. Is that what it is? That's what it is, right? It's just,
[512.52s -> 518.28s]  I'm going to shake my butt. That's it. Is there anything else to that? Or is there more to it?
[520.44s -> 537.00s]  Is it something else? What else would it mean? I don't know. I have no idea. Stop mocking rump
[537.00s -> 550.66s]  shake. Oh, okay. Here we go. All right. Here we go. All right. Let's play this game. I am to the brim
[551.46s -> 558.02s]  of excitement. There's things. There's so many things. I just want to scream it at you,
[558.02s -> 561.30s]  but we'll wait. We'll wait. We'll wait. We'll wait. We're going to wait. We have to wait.
[564.38s -> 577.85s]  But yeah, keep an eye on the sus. Keep an eye on, but he's do the roar. This is end of the stream.
[577.85s -> 594.78s]  I just turned it on. This is me time. Okay. Let's go. I'm, I'm turning it on. There it is. All right.
[594.78s -> 601.24s]  This is disc room. And yeah, I did get this on game pass. I don't, I mean, it seems like it's
[601.24s -> 608.49s]  going to be really fun. This is a game about concentration. It's a game about, uh, keeping,
[609.69s -> 619.99s]  being good at dodging. It's one of the only things I can do. In 2092, a giant disc is discovered in
[619.99s -> 634.78s]  orbit of Jupiter. A crew of international scientists is sent to investigate. Oh, cartoon.
[634.86s -> 646.89s]  Left stick is move. I'm, this is going to be fun. You just have to live. That's it.
[647.53s -> 665.45s]  The only thing you do game about precision. It's the, it's the sans fight. I guess it kind of is,
[665.45s -> 673.46s]  it is kind of the same undertale concept, isn't it? Kind of feels like I'm doing pretty damn good
[673.46s -> 683.08s]  already. This first room you would have, you would have died at five seconds. All right.
[683.64s -> 691.22s]  That's all right. All right. So survive five seconds. I did that die from four different
[691.22s -> 699.02s]  discs. I can go left or I can stay over here. Well, how do I get the, um, doesn't usually,
[699.02s -> 706.50s]  well, let me see. How do I start starting here again? Oh, I think I'm, I have to do tutorial
[706.50s -> 712.15s]  stuff. It's like asteroids. All right. Survive 10 seconds. That's all I have to do. I think it
[712.15s -> 717.80s]  usually shows the developer time, the person that made the game. Okay. I was looking at chat. Shut
[717.80s -> 732.52s]  up. Four seconds. Yeah. I, I got it. I already did. I beat it already. In fact, I should just
[732.52s -> 740.25s]  hurry up and get to the next room because this guy sucks at this. I just did it. I'm over time
[740.25s -> 756.18s]  right now. Opportunity right here. One, two. Oh, sorry. New best time. How does it, I think it's
[756.18s -> 763.88s]  supposed to show the dev time. How come I can't see that? Hold on a second. Let me restart this.
[763.88s -> 782.68s]  How do I show that? Yeah. Dev team time. This says it's on. How come I can't see it? Yeah. See
[782.68s -> 801.21s]  ready? Look, uh, game. See dev team times on. It should be on. I can't do it. The devs never beat
[801.21s -> 811.58s]  this. It's not in the tutorial. Oh, okay. All right. So I already did this one. We can take a look at
[811.58s -> 816.15s]  the, take a look at this. So this is the game. This is the whole game. So kind of like the rooms
[816.15s -> 823.51s]  are connected. That's pretty cool. So we can go up. We're going to go up. All right. Die from four
[823.51s -> 833.59s]  disc types and survive 10 seconds. Easy. Let's go. That was just a practice one. See, I didn't get
[833.59s -> 845.88s]  that move. That's why I couldn't do it. All right. Hold A to dash through discs. Here we go. See,
[846.86s -> 851.50s]  you give me one button that's a dash and an analog stick. I'm going to beat every single
[851.50s -> 861.48s]  fucking record in this entire game. Is this Omega gaming weekend? No. In fact, this is Omega short
[861.48s -> 874.89s]  weekend. This is exceptionally small weekend. That's all right. I'll take it. I'll take it.
[874.89s -> 886.04s]  Where should I go from here? I'm going to go up. Dude, you suck. I'm beating every level.
[887.02s -> 906.12s]  I'm completing every level of man. That's all right. I didn't do it. Come on. Come on, man.
[906.12s -> 915.53s]  Nobody said chill, please. Are you talking to me? You're talking to the chat. I don't know who you're
[915.53s -> 926.71s]  talking to. Here we go. Oh, I want to talk about this. This is really important. This is food
[926.71s -> 931.43s]  related. So I know everyone's going to be really excited to hear that. I know at least 10 people
[931.43s -> 938.87s]  in the chat heard it was food related. So they just, yes, let's go. Okay. Let me ask a question.
[938.87s -> 945.82s]  I don't want to be rude. I'm trying. I'm going to try not to be. Can I go up? Oh, no, this is a dead
[945.82s -> 952.50s]  end. Oh, there is no complete this one. All right. All right. So here's what I want to talk about.
[952.50s -> 960.34s]  I don't want to be disrespectful. I don't want to be mean about this, but there's anyone has
[960.34s -> 964.02s]  anybody in this chat and of all the 13 plus thousand people that are here right now,
[964.66s -> 973.30s]  13,000 of you, have you ever, ever bought heavy pulp orange juice? Any of you, a single person
[973.30s -> 982.23s]  in the whole chat, because honestly, I think, I think that's like my first test to see if you're
[982.23s -> 987.08s]  a psycho. If you drink heavy pulp orange juice, is that like, is that weird to say that?
[988.94s -> 998.42s]  I'm not talking about medium pulp. I'm talking heavy pulp, heavy pulp. One of the mods. Wait,
[998.50s -> 1005.74s]  we are Josh. What the fuck, dude? I don't look, I don't mind pulp. Light pulp is good. Medium pulp.
[1005.74s -> 1011.10s]  But at some point it's, I feel like I'm drinking wet wood shavings in my orange juice. I feel like
[1011.10s -> 1019.03s]  I'm drinking bugs. It's heavy pulp is, is, is ridiculous. It's, it's sludge. It's not even
[1019.03s -> 1028.23s]  orange juice. I like pulp. Hope is fine. But too much of too much is, is too much. Wait, what
[1028.23s -> 1041.86s]  heavy pulp? It gets like stuck in your teeth and shit in a smoothie. All right. Yep. Okay.
[1042.58s -> 1047.69s]  All right. I want to say, I'm not seeing the dev times. I might have to restart.
[1048.25s -> 1054.31s]  That makes sense to me. I get it. All right. 10 seconds. Survive zero seconds or less.
[1054.95s -> 1064.78s]  Okay. So survive 10. I could see a smoothie because you want some of the actual orange in it.
[1065.42s -> 1073.80s]  I get that. But anytime I've ever seen heavy pulp get poured, it reminds me of sour milk,
[1074.68s -> 1081.06s]  where you pour it and it's like, you know what I'm talking about. It's that like,
[1081.06s -> 1093.02s]  slop, slop, slop, slop, slop, slop, slop, slop. Fucking gross. All right. Survive zero seconds or
[1093.02s -> 1105.62s]  less. Did I do it? How do you, how do I die in zero seconds? It takes a second for it to spawn.
[1105.62s -> 1118.90s]  Did I get, I got it right there at zero, right? How do you, how do I die instantly?
[1123.53s -> 1130.94s]  Zero seconds or less. Hey asshole, I'm drinking milk right now. Don't ruin it.
[1133.98s -> 1150.10s]  I just imagine you with a 24 ounce glass of milk. How 0.007. I don't think this is possible.
[1150.10s -> 1162.63s]  Die from 15 disc types. All right. Well, this one, this one is a different one here. Yep. Any more
[1162.63s -> 1183.48s]  in here that count? Yep. That one counts. I gotta go left. Defeat the gatekeeper in 10 seconds. How
[1183.56s -> 1195.30s]  do I do it? Can I hit him? Oh, okay. I get it. This game is going to get,
[1196.74s -> 1203.08s]  when's the dog food tier list? What is the tier list that I actually wanted to do? I forgot to
[1203.08s -> 1217.67s]  bring it up. There's a tier list I want to do. What was it? Shit. Oh my God. This is going to
[1217.67s -> 1225.62s]  drive me crazy. What was it? No, no, no, no, no, no. I never talked about it. Shit. This is why I
[1225.62s -> 1233.88s]  write everything down. I just, I didn't write this one down. It'll come to me in a minute.
[1241.58s -> 1249.11s]  Oh, what? Oh, right. I wanted to, cause I saw the, the MK one trailer, which was
[1249.11s -> 1258.89s]  fucking ridiculous by the way. Uh, I wanted to do a rate, put every like a tier list for all the
[1258.89s -> 1273.93s]  Mortal Kombat characters ever. That would be kind of fun. Do a Mortal Kombat character tier list.
[1273.93s -> 1280.17s]  Do it now. No, I mean like an, like a, I don't know, like six to 12 months. What does this do?
[1283.78s -> 1291.00s]  I still can't see the time played total deaths. Oh, it's keeping track of all this.
[1291.00s -> 1303.38s]  That'll be in a year. Oh, that's all right. All right. So I want to go up. It's keeping
[1303.38s -> 1309.77s]  track of my total play time. Do it right now. You weirdo. No, and like, like six or seven years
[1309.77s -> 1329.40s]  or something. I have to last wait. Why is that not counting anymore? Oh, you have to stand in the
[1329.40s -> 1347.35s]  middle. I think I could do at least 30 seconds here. It didn't mean six to seven years. You're
[1347.35s -> 1364.06s]  not even going to be streaming then I'm talking about on Mars. Oh, we're good. I'm still here.
[1366.57s -> 1373.64s]  Oh, that had to have been pretty good. That had to have been pretty good.
[1384.33s -> 1390.47s]  Don't have to die from, yeah, I have to be killed by a few different discs, right? 15. I haven't
[1390.47s -> 1402.10s]  been killed by this one. That opens one of the other doors and get over there. Yep. Oh,
[1403.62s -> 1414.63s]  you have to pick one. I'll try slow best time. 30 seconds. I can do better than that.
[1417.75s -> 1423.37s]  That lasts a long time. Oh, it doesn't recharge. I think it does. This is way better than dash.
[1425.99s -> 1433.94s]  Maybe not. Oh, hold on. I can do better than that. What's this game? This game is called disc room.
[1435.35s -> 1460.68s]  And you can get it right now on, you know, sound is good. No, it sounds great. What was my record
[1460.68s -> 1485.22s]  on this 30 seconds? Oh, oh, shit. I can do better than that. I have to beat the record here. Die to
[1485.22s -> 1494.73s]  the golden disc. That's actually true. That's really true. Are you ever going to do a beer
[1494.73s -> 1512.71s]  drinking stream? No. Oh, all right. I did it. I need to go to undiscovered disc survived 20 seconds.
[1512.71s -> 1523.03s]  Oh, shit. I got to do that down here. Let's go. But you want me to like rate beers. I mean,
[1523.03s -> 1527.03s]  I could do that. I could. Do you want me to do a beer drinking tier list? Like where the,
[1527.03s -> 1540.39s]  where they belong? Okay. I don't know. I'll figure it out. I'll set it up. I'll figure that out.
[1540.39s -> 1549.62s]  God damn it. They're all going to be put in F. That's not necessarily true.
[1553.54s -> 1559.06s]  I have to survive 20 seconds. There's probably another tier for a minute, too.
[1560.58s -> 1568.84s]  Not just American beers. No, I know. I'm thinking maybe the top, the most popular three or four per
[1568.84s -> 1576.54s]  country. That's very doable considering that's probably four or five thousand different beers.
[1577.90s -> 1584.74s]  Sure. I got it. All right. I got to go right and up because this one is 20 seconds.
[1586.12s -> 1600.49s]  Armored gatekeeper. Best time 10 seconds. So how do I do 20 seconds here? Is that possible?
[1600.49s -> 1609.64s]  Survived 20 seconds. Undiscovered disc. How do I do this? I have to get 20 orbs. Oh,
[1610.68s -> 1622.73s]  I thought he explodes after 10. Irma thinks there are like 20 countries. No, I just said
[1622.73s -> 1631.32s]  there was that was thousands of beers. Every country has its own beer. Every country has its
[1631.32s -> 1642.46s]  own beer that it makes. They all everybody makes a beer. Every country. I'm telling you every.
[1642.46s -> 1654.97s]  I got it. If OK, if you name a country and then go to Google and type in
[1656.86s -> 1663.42s]  what is this country's beer, it's going to give you a like, oh, it's a 40 percent hop to say
[1663.42s -> 1666.62s]  flavored with pineapple extract. I don't know. It's going to be something.
[1677.05s -> 1695.26s]  All right. Well, we can't let's just say most just say most countries. That's I mean, come on.
[1695.50s -> 1702.31s]  You can't you can't take literally. I mean, like I don't ever speak in literal terms. I'm speaking
[1702.31s -> 1712.12s]  in like most mostly terms like every country has got a beer. Oh, yeah. Well, what about this
[1712.12s -> 1716.12s]  country? This country doesn't have a beer. Yeah. All right. Well, maybe they do. Maybe they don't.
[1716.12s -> 1731.02s]  I don't know. Well, don't say that. Well, I don't know. Literal Andy, you said every. Yeah. But
[1731.02s -> 1738.66s]  like I'm sure there probably is something. Name me a country right now. Just I'm going to. OK,
[1738.66s -> 1750.65s]  let's let's I'm going to let's do a random country. OK, what is Spain? Spain's beer,
[1754.65s -> 1763.53s]  Spanish beer. Oh, interesting. What's Spain's most popular beer? It is called a San Miguel.
[1764.78s -> 1772.36s]  A San Miguel Classica is the most traditionally and best known among the Spanish population.
[1772.36s -> 1787.75s]  Would you look at that? What about Brazil? Brazil's beer? Here we go. What's the most popular
[1787.75s -> 1803.83s]  beer in Brazil? Skoll, Brahma, Antarctica, Nova Shin. Huh? These are Brazilian beers.
[1803.83s -> 1816.39s]  Come on. Those are craft Brazilian beers, and they're probably fucking wonderful.
[1816.47s -> 1828.87s]  OK, yeah, but not every. OK, not every single country on Earth will look. There's some countries
[1828.87s -> 1842.66s]  that this is not going to happen. Backtrack and Barry. No, it's called it's called nitpick.
[1842.66s -> 1854.74s]  Nancy is what we got over here. All right. I have to do this. I'm going to freak out.
[1864.01s -> 1870.18s]  Shit. Why don't I look at Chad? Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of beer.
[1871.46s -> 1878.34s]  Maybe you know what I would do? Maybe the most popular beer from most countries.
[1878.98s -> 1885.37s]  I feel like, wait, I'll get shit faced. It's too muddy beers. I can't drink like 100 plus beers.
[1886.09s -> 1892.10s]  If I take a sip out of 100 beers, how many beers is that? Can somebody do the calculation?
[1892.82s -> 1900.90s]  Like if you take how much how many ounces of liquid is in one sip or two sips? And how many
[1900.90s -> 1924.12s]  beers is 100 sips? I didn't even do it. You do it lazy. I'm playing a game. 10 beers is one sip.
[1925.08s -> 1942.49s]  Maybe maybe for some maybe for some YouTubers. Do you know who I've been watching lately? I just
[1942.49s -> 1952.74s]  like it's just I love it so much. It's a L.A. beast. It's just that his videos just go so wild.
[1952.74s -> 1966.82s]  They're just so they're just fucking outrageous. I never really watched much of his content,
[1967.70s -> 1974.74s]  but sometimes you just want to watch a guy eat like fucking 30 White Castle hamburger.
[1980.20s -> 1984.68s]  And he pukes. He like pukes like he pukes and like shits and some of these
[1993.59s -> 2007.74s]  those are rookie numbers. No, they are not. Are you kidding me? I also have some more
[2007.74s -> 2015.99s]  interesting news to share with everybody to share with the class. I remember when I told you
[2016.55s -> 2023.58s]  that I had never had White Castle before. I did. I did have it. I have to get to 20 seconds.
[2026.14s -> 2038.87s]  I had White Castle. Let me tell you, I want to give it a rating. This shit was at least
[2038.87s -> 2049.64s]  at least a B plus. At least. I don't understand the naysayers. It's like it's fine. It's good.
[2049.64s -> 2064.55s]  It's just yummy. It's just a delicious simple just little cheeseburger slider. Come on. I got it.
[2072.49s -> 2083.16s]  Shit. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You know what? I'll give you. I'll give you a hot
[2083.16s -> 2088.84s]  take. I think a lot of people don't want to admit that they like simple things because it's like
[2088.84s -> 2098.79s]  makes them simple for some reason. Like, oh, White Castle. No, gross sucks. It's stupid.
[2100.47s -> 2104.55s]  I almost feel like a lot of people, they probably do kind of like it, but if they say they like
[2104.55s -> 2109.91s]  something that's too simple, does that make me kind of like boring or something? No, it doesn't.
[2109.91s -> 2117.85s]  It doesn't. Don't worry. Just eat it. Now, some of you probably really do think it sucks and that's
[2117.85s -> 2123.77s]  fine. And I know there's a lot of you that have eaten it that were, you know, maybe you were in,
[2123.77s -> 2127.37s]  maybe you're in the car or maybe you got back to when your friends were all there and
[2128.17s -> 2134.57s]  y'all took a bite at the same time and two of your friends were like, oh, oh,
[2135.37s -> 2141.69s]  gross. And you were sitting there silently. I kind of like this. You were like, yeah, it's like,
[2141.69s -> 2158.20s]  man, whatever. It's too hyped up. Who was he talking to? You. I haven't admitted to you guys
[2158.20s -> 2162.12s]  that I liked the Venom movie. You know what I'm saying? I feel like it's kind of similar.
[2162.84s -> 2176.87s]  The thing is I didn't like the Venom movie because it was full of nutritional value,
[2176.87s -> 2184.18s]  right? Let's use this as an example. I just liked it because the movie was fucking dumb and like fun
[2184.18s -> 2199.42s]  and stupid and weird. And then it was like one of my favorite characters. So sorry. This is,
[2199.42s -> 2203.10s]  I'm addicted to trying to do this, but I just can't. I'm going to be quiet until I do this.
[2203.90s -> 2223.77s]  Why did I, I didn't pick it up. Ollie is calling me out here. She's saying, but how did you get
[2223.77s -> 2233.93s]  the White Castle? Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm in big fucking trouble now.
[2236.41s -> 2240.33s]  It was the frozen shit from the grocery store and I still thought it was a B plus
[2240.33s -> 2245.45s]  fucking hate me all you want. I don't care. Go ahead. Go ahead. You don't like me anymore.
[2246.76s -> 2258.07s]  You don't like me anymore. I never did. Oh, so if I had the real thing, would that be an A?
[2258.07s -> 2294.58s]  I, I would still eat a hot pocket and go, that's fine. That one's unfair where it is. Got it. Let's
[2294.58s -> 2317.30s]  go. Nice. Feels good. Yes. It's okay. I got it. I got to go here because I need 20 seconds here as
[2317.30s -> 2328.58s]  well. Use the bumpers and triggers. What does that do? They kind of zoom in a little. Whoa.
[2329.46s -> 2351.88s]  Wait, that's speeding the game up. Oh my God. Okay. That's, that's hard mode. Were you high
[2351.88s -> 2368.30s]  when you ate the frozen white castle? No, no, I was not. Was not, you know, time that first
[2368.30s -> 2384.07s]  enough for even asking that question. You know, like how dare you talking about drugs, talking
[2384.07s -> 2406.62s]  about marijuana or something. Devil, the devil, devil, the devil. Oh my God. I have, I don't have
[2406.62s -> 2432.47s]  to get 20 seconds on every single map, do I? I kind of do. What saws have I not died to? Oh shit.
[2435.08s -> 2450.34s]  Come on. I got killed by the golden saw, didn't I? Do I actually get anything for doing 20 seconds
[2450.34s -> 2472.87s]  on each map or is that just a bragging rights? Oh, that was close. Sorry. I got it. All right.
[2472.87s -> 2479.46s]  So I got to go left and then up. What about down? What's down here? Survive? Yeah. Zero seconds.
[2480.18s -> 2499.59s]  I don't get it. How do you die in zeros? Whoa. I know that's how got it. Cool. Okay. Really cool.
[2499.59s -> 2520.46s]  What's this one? Stay sharp. I don't think I got killed by that one yet. I'm not actually quite.
[2520.46s -> 2530.31s]  I think the dash might actually be better, but feel more comfortable with this one. Wait,
[2530.31s -> 2535.56s]  this is important. One of the mods trotter. I also checked out the beer thing. A sip is about
[2535.56s -> 2542.84s]  four milliliters and a can of beer is 12 ounces or 341 milliliters. One sip from 100 beer cans
[2542.84s -> 2555.21s]  would be roughly just a bit over one beer at 14 ounces. Really? Huh. One sip is about four
[2555.21s -> 2563.00s]  milliliters. I could probably do that then. The one thing that I'm afraid of, of doing that stream
[2563.00s -> 2573.18s]  is offending an entire country. You know what I mean? I definitely don't, I don't want to like
[2573.18s -> 2580.06s]  do the, oh, the what country has the best tasting beer test. And some countries like they're ready.
[2580.06s -> 2585.10s]  Oh my God. I can't wait to see. He's going to have our beer. I take a sip out of it. I'm like,
[2587.18s -> 2599.03s]  I feel like that would really disappoint a lot of people. They all got their, their beer branded
[2599.03s -> 2605.38s]  hats on and they've got like a case of it. They're like, I'm ready. And then they have to question
[2605.38s -> 2609.35s]  everything. Well, no, actually this is fine because then they would just go, no, he likes
[2609.35s -> 2618.47s]  White Castle. Nevermind. We're good. They don't think this is all calculated. You don't think I,
[2618.47s -> 2633.03s]  this is incredibly calculated everything I'm saying every day. Give me a little bit of credit.
[2633.03s -> 2651.54s]  Frozen food tier list. That actually sounds kind of fun. I don't think this is even connected to
[2651.54s -> 2667.86s]  anything. Shit. 20 seconds. Come on. Damn it. When are we going to get Otto's augtastic adventure?
[2668.66s -> 2683.43s]  I don't know. I just thought of Otto. The trail is so long on these things.
[2683.43s -> 2699.59s]  Almost there. Oh yes. Thank God. Okay. I got it. We got the whole bottom row cleared. Where should
[2699.59s -> 2708.60s]  I go up? I'll try to see what's the criteria. Ah, I have to die to three more. What have I not?
[2711.75s -> 2716.09s]  There are four disks in this room. I have not been killed by. Oh, but there's one that I haven't
[2716.09s -> 2748.89s]  been killed by. Which one? Second phase of this one. Ah, okay. Oh, you were right. All right.
[2748.89s -> 2754.07s]  Cool. I've been hit by everything here, everything here, everything here.
[2754.07s -> 2767.13s]  Is there one that I haven't been hit by? I think I got them all. All right. Let's just go up and
[2767.13s -> 2776.95s]  then right. Survive for five seconds. Easy. Protect your bowels. Dude. Don't do a frozen food tier list.
[2802.63s -> 2821.77s]  I got to get at least 30 seconds on some of these. That was pretty damn good.
[2821.77s -> 2829.19s]  I'll take that one. That's pretty good. Will you do an Arby's full menu tier list? No,
[2829.19s -> 2837.64s]  no, that doesn't sound like fun. I really don't think I would really even hate Arby's, but
[2837.64s -> 2849.99s]  no, it doesn't sound good. Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms. Okay. Defeat two gatekeepers.
[2849.99s -> 2854.41s]  And I'm already doing a pretty, pretty good job already. What? Die from this?
[2855.05s -> 2865.19s]  Okay. What about a Febreze scent tier list? That's the fastest way to get a migraine.
[2865.19s -> 2888.09s]  What about an orange juice? Didn't you promise a BLT today? A few people are asking about it.
[2888.09s -> 2895.30s]  I love how that's what people are asking about. This community. I love this community. It's just.
[2896.10s -> 2901.61s]  Hey dude, like, um, where's the BLT stream? Like I've just, we're just kind of curious about it.
[2901.61s -> 2906.09s]  We really just want to know like if that was bullshit or not, or if we should expect that or
[2907.05s -> 2911.72s]  I'm kind of waiting around to see. It's like, I don't know, man,
[2913.16s -> 2927.02s]  but I don't, I don't like any of you individually. Okay. I like you collectively. Make that really
[2927.02s -> 2968.34s]  clear. I just said, fuck you. Hey, he hates us. I didn't say that. You said that. I said that.
[2968.82s -> 2982.47s]  No, I'm just saying that. I mean, no BLT, dude. I mean, not right. Not today. Guys. I don't even
[2982.47s -> 2991.66s]  have the ingredients to make a BLT. Doesn't that seem strange? But it's true. Think about the
[2991.66s -> 2998.55s]  ingredients of BLT. I don't have them. I don't have, well, I mean, you need to sub roll. Oh no,
[2998.55s -> 3007.22s]  you don't. I don't have no bread. Now I need to go to the store. I don't have no bread, no bacon,
[3007.22s -> 3020.52s]  no lettuce, no tomatoes. The only thing that's on a BLT that I own right now is mayo. They don't
[3020.52s -> 3027.32s]  have any bread. We just ran out of bread. It's not a infinite resource. You have to go and get it
[3027.32s -> 3034.28s]  again after you go run out. There's not a bread machine that's in your house that just, well,
[3034.28s -> 3048.47s]  you might make your own bread, but that's pretty cool. But it's not what I'm referring to. Just
[3048.47s -> 3054.31s]  use the mayo, dude. So you want me to take a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich,
[3055.19s -> 3061.91s]  remove the entire sandwich, and eat a spoonful of mayonnaise. So why don't you just say what you
[3061.91s -> 3082.09s]  want me to do? Bro, eat a spoonful of mayonnaise. It would be funny. Childish. That was pretty good.
[3082.09s -> 3092.34s]  I have 10 seconds. Is this, oh, this is a gatekeeper. Uh, you can kill me though.
[3093.50s -> 3098.25s]  You can kill me. Okay. There's one more disk in here I need to die to.
[3102.41s -> 3112.73s]  Okay. Mayonnaise is your entire diet. I mean, you make one jokey food pyramid joke
[3113.45s -> 3125.53s]  and everybody thinks you eat mayonnaise with your hands out of the jar. Is that the one I have to,
[3125.53s -> 3149.50s]  well, let me beat it first. Also the ad campaign that a lot of mayonnaise is doing right now,
[3149.50s -> 3156.57s]  they're doing kind of like the Reese's campaigns. Like the kind of like, sorry, not sorry. Not sorry.
[3156.57s -> 3166.82s]  Yeah. Mayo. Not sorry. It's like, it's just mayonnaise and I like it. I don't care. Oh,
[3166.82s -> 3170.82s]  those of us that like dip our sandwiches in mayo. I don't do that. I love mayonnaise,
[3170.82s -> 3190.23s]  but I don't do it. Not sorry. No, stop. Why are you so dramatic? I'm just kind of messing around.
[3190.23s -> 3208.82s]  Who's that? Hey, can you wish me luck? I got finals tomorrow. You do. You do. You do you.
[3209.14s -> 3231.22s]  No, I can't. I was going to say you do as best as a job as you can. God damn it. You do.
[3232.71s -> 3235.83s]  You, I can't tell you, you're going to do good. I don't know what if you didn't study.
[3237.45s -> 3242.74s]  I don't want to be responsible if you don't do well. Do your best. I hope you'd fucking studied
[3242.74s -> 3261.48s]  for it and get at least a C or a B. You'll be all right. You do you. It wouldn't be funny
[3261.48s -> 3280.26s]  if it wasn't true. You know what I mean? Why not A? Because you can't tell somebody to get an A.
[3290.97s -> 3296.17s]  You can't say, hey, yeah, get an A. No, that's too much pressure to have to think about.
[3297.05s -> 3306.14s]  Get an A? Get a near perfect score. What? I'm sorry. I'm of the opinion.
[3306.86s -> 3311.46s]  You don't have to have a perfect score. You just need to know the information.
[3312.18s -> 3319.93s]  There's a difference between retention and memorization. You understand? Retention,
[3319.93s -> 3327.50s]  knowledge retention is incredibly important. Knowledge memorization. Is it really retention?
[3338.82s -> 3349.40s]  High horse Andy. You know what? You do you. High horse Andy. High horse Andy would be me saying,
[3349.40s -> 3353.40s]  I got A's in every class. Therefore you should too. I'm way smarter than you.
[3354.12s -> 3360.84s]  That is not what I said. That's not high horse Andy. That's me saying I got C's and
[3360.84s -> 3388.31s]  I don't give a shit. Bad role model. Your role model should be like fucking Abraham Lincoln and
[3388.31s -> 3402.76s]  shit. Not me. Your role model should be like, I don't know. Wait, what's this? Clone yourself.
[3409.66s -> 3429.75s]  Oh, that's kind of cool. Dude, pick somebody that's alive. That's true. That's true.
[3430.31s -> 3440.46s]  Okay. Can I keep pressing it? How many times can I do this? I feel like this is cheating.
[3441.26s -> 3463.75s]  Oh my goodness. That was only nine seconds. Oh, every time I spawn one, I lose a second.
[3463.75s -> 3473.99s]  That's the trade off. Okay. I get it. All right. We're going, we're going back to the other one.
[3473.99s -> 3499.46s]  I like this one better. 20 seconds. Can you please explain the stream tags? Hates having enough
[3499.46s -> 3528.28s]  fiber. I don't know. I, the mods have access to this. They do whatever they want. Oh, whoa.
[3529.40s -> 3541.91s]  That was really cool, but I didn't get 20. You don't like goat cheese. I very, very, very much
[3541.91s -> 3553.80s]  don't. I, goat cheese to me is, and it's so, I hate it. If I ever am out at a restaurant or something
[3554.76s -> 3559.08s]  with a bunch of people and hanging out and somebody gets like a goat cheese appetizer
[3559.08s -> 3565.58s]  and everybody's eating it. It's like, I, I don't want that. Or there's like salads or something
[3565.58s -> 3571.06s]  that has it on it. And people see that I'm doing the thing where you take the knife and you just
[3571.06s -> 3588.49s]  scrape it off to the side. I just don't, I must have my, my DNA must be different than yours
[3588.49s -> 3593.13s]  because you know what I mean? Like we must have a completely different, however, like the food DNA
[3593.13s -> 3605.58s]  part of your brain is because I find goat cheese to be absolutely revolting. And I mean, and, but
[3605.58s -> 3609.98s]  I like blue cheese and you think that that, a lot of you think that's absolutely revolting
[3613.14s -> 3623.34s]  and that's all right. I think blue cheese tastes like yummy, creamy deliciousness. And I think
[3623.34s -> 3628.87s]  goat cheese tastes like dirt, like a soil out of the ground, like a spoonful of it in your mouth.
[3635.40s -> 3647.91s]  Shit. I need 20 seconds. You only like blue cheese to be different. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[3649.11s -> 3652.87s]  One of my favorite flavors on all right. I'm shutting that person down. That person needs
[3652.87s -> 3661.83s]  to get that person needs to get shut down right now. Blue cheese and hot sauce is my favorite
[3661.83s -> 3668.23s]  flavor combination in the world. If you have, if there was a flavor tier list, no, sorry. It's not
[3668.23s -> 3677.94s]  blue raspberry. Stupid. It's, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You do you. All right. That's the end of the
[3677.94s -> 3701.64s]  story. All right. In real talk though, I would put blue cheese and hot sauce at over S and it's
[3701.64s -> 3713.30s]  probably the only thing that's there. Why are you being so strange? I don't know. Just fucking around.
[3720.39s -> 3728.04s]  Now I don't put it on everything. I, I like blue cheese where I think blue cheese belongs.
[3728.98s -> 3735.69s]  I think blue cheese belongs on Buffalo chicken, a Buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese on it
[3736.92s -> 3744.92s]  is unmatched. It's undeniably unmatched. It is the best single probably food item in the world
[3744.92s -> 3749.96s]  is a Buffalo chicken sub in the world. And I really don't think anything can compare to it.
[3751.75s -> 3759.48s]  The second thing on that list would be a perfectly cooked piece of salmon. That's number two.
[3764.17s -> 3775.27s]  That is way above blue raspberry. And we're talking flavor, like flavor profile. I don't put blue
[3775.27s -> 3779.27s]  cheese on salmon. No, I'm saying that, that, that what we've moved on to a different topic,
[3779.27s -> 3790.10s]  a different flavor. Where is mint on that list? Very low. Spear mint is, is okay. It's high.
[3790.10s -> 3798.86s]  Peppermint is, I like peppermint tea, but I think mint is it's a, I don't hate it. I don't love it.
[3798.86s -> 3806.04s]  I think it's fine. I like Spear mint. Oh, Holy shit. You guys need to know this. I have to tell
[3806.04s -> 3810.84s]  you this and I don't care. You can call me like, like brand shill Andy. I don't care.
[3812.02s -> 3821.54s]  Do you want to know what the best hot sauce in the world is in the world? I got killed by,
[3821.54s -> 3828.70s]  Oh wait, I can go down here now. Yep. Best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco,
[3828.70s -> 3836.07s]  but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not had. Oh, and I just burped a little,
[3836.79s -> 3844.06s]  it's one that I haven't. Ooh, this is weird. It's a different flavor of Tabasco. Are you ready?
[3846.95s -> 3861.05s]  The Tabasco Habanero sauce is un fucking believable. It is probably the single greatest hot
[3861.05s -> 3867.72s]  sauce ever invented. Trust me. It is, there's a lot of truths here and I'm so glad. I am so glad
[3867.72s -> 3890.42s]  that a lot of, you know, Tabasco Habanero is, it makes everything better. Everything. Did somebody
[3890.50s -> 3894.98s]  say you've definitely never had it? What? Why would I say I love it? That's weird.
[3895.78s -> 3912.18s]  I can absorb a disc. It's really hot. Old A to absorb. I said, I've never had it. What?
[3912.18s -> 3921.90s]  You just said you'd never had it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on? Wait, what's happening?
[3921.90s -> 3930.62s]  You've never, I've never, this, you, can somebody give me a clip or something? I said, the bottle's
[3930.62s -> 3946.86s]  gone. I haven't had it. Somebody clip me. What? You definitely said that buddy. That means you're like
[3946.86s -> 3950.38s]  mad. If you say buddy at the end of a sentence, that means like you're pissed at me. What? I'm
[3950.38s -> 3973.16s]  serious. Like when did I say that? I don't see a clipper. He's not had it. So it's one. Yep.
[3973.16s -> 3977.80s]  Best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not
[3977.80s -> 3993.32s]  had. What? Why did I say that? I'm so confused. I feel like, I feel like you edited this clip
[3993.32s -> 3997.40s]  and made me say that. Well, I had to have been talking about something else. Best hot sauce in
[3997.40s -> 4003.24s]  the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not had. I, I think
[4003.24s -> 4009.64s]  what I was trying to say is it's one that I haven't talked about. One that I have not said, I think is
[4009.64s -> 4016.49s]  one that I have not said. Had, yeah, I said that completely wrong. It's okay. Best hot sauce in
[4016.49s -> 4020.97s]  the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not had. One that I
[4020.97s -> 4028.65s]  have not said on stream or had till recently. That's what it was. Yes. That's what it is. Thank you.
[4029.21s -> 4032.58s]  It was one that I've not had till recently. I got cut off because somebody made fun of me.
[4032.58s -> 4036.82s]  It was the one that I, because I, I, me and Holly just started eating it like over the last month
[4036.82s -> 4043.40s]  or two. That's what it was. Somebody called me a fucking name. So I had to pause for a second.
[4045.16s -> 4052.02s]  Um, but yeah, it's one that I haven't had till recently. That sounds so stupid out of context.
[4052.90s -> 4065.85s]  All right. But yeah, it is unfucking believable. It's really hot though. The habanero Tabasco is
[4065.85s -> 4073.96s]  the kind of sauce where you eat it and it hurts. It's ha ha, but I think it's tolerable.
[4073.96s -> 4086.36s]  If you don't think habanero is tolerable, it is very hot. The other one. Um, oh shit. I've had
[4086.36s -> 4095.98s]  also the, I think it's, what is it? The, the scorpion sauce, whatever it's called. It's,
[4095.98s -> 4102.79s]  it's red. It's a bright red Tabasco, um, scorpion or something. That one's really good too,
[4106.68s -> 4109.48s]  but that one is really, that one's like dangerous. That one hurts a lot.
[4110.36s -> 4128.86s]  One drop of that is really painful, but it's really good. He's eating bugs. All right. I got 20.
[4131.66s -> 4137.35s]  What was the hot sauce? It was Tabasco habanero. It's hot. It's really hot. So don't fuck around
[4137.35s -> 4151.43s]  with this stuff. Both of them are. I might get a minute on this one. I did not absorb it. Oh,
[4151.43s -> 4165.99s]  well we can go right. I'm going to go down. Yeah. The, uh, the habanero one, it's interesting
[4165.99s -> 4184.17s]  because it's got like bananas, mango, tamarind in it. It's good. Is there any pulp in it?
[4185.05s -> 4187.93s]  There's a little bit of bits, nothing much though. It's pretty clear.
[4188.73s -> 4219.22s]  You ever have the ketchup one? I've had Tabasco and ketchup before. It's good. Shit. Oh God. Okay.
[4219.22s -> 4249.26s]  Where are they going? Oh, oh man. It's over. No. Yes. Okay. I'm good. 30 seconds. Oh my God. I'll
[4249.26s -> 4261.74s]  try. I remember you would probably bail Willy Wonka's chocolate factory tests. No, I wouldn't.
[4261.74s -> 4266.23s]  I'm not touching anything there. Are you kidding me? I don't know what the fuck is in it. All that
[4266.23s -> 4273.51s]  shit. Never last and gobstopper. It never ends. Why? What's in it? Well, that's a secret. I don't
[4273.51s -> 4278.52s]  want to put that. I'm not putting it in my mouth, Willy. It's a secret. It lasts forever. Why? I
[4278.52s -> 4291.53s]  don't, I'm not eating that until I know what's in it. Listen, Bill, I'm not putting that in my mouth.
[4292.09s -> 4299.70s]  I want to see the ingredients list. What kind of preservatives do you have in there? The high
[4299.70s -> 4312.74s]  fructose corn syrup in that too, Bill? Yeah, that's what I thought. Uh, how would I do this?
[4313.46s -> 4339.86s]  How are you supposed to beat this one? Survive for 10 seconds. Maybe with the clones. This is. Oh,
[4339.86s -> 4407.02s]  okay. Slow. Dude, this one sucks. Wow. Okay. Shit. Come on, man. I had it. I'm alive. Damn it. I
[4407.02s -> 4437.61s]  didn't have any left. I got it. Nice. Thank God. 20 seconds on this one. No way. Not a chance. I
[4437.61s -> 4456.84s]  almost had it. Not this one too, right? No, we're okay. Oh, that's kind of helpful. I wanted to get
[4456.84s -> 4467.86s]  hit by the discs. That was unpleasant. Yeah, it kind of was. I don't think we have to do it again,
[4467.86s -> 4480.39s]  though. How's the garden going? Probably get some updates there in the next, uh, next week or so.
[4484.60s -> 4498.15s]  Sprouts have, uh, have crested the dirt. I know people really asking about the beetles, but, uh,
[4498.87s -> 4514.33s]  I don't have them. Let's take it slow and I should get this one fine. I might get a minute on this
[4514.33s -> 4549.11s]  one. This one's probably the easiest one of the whole bunch right now. Let me get a minute. Nice.
[4550.20s -> 4572.26s]  Very nice. Oh, just keep going this way. We're good. Get all the way down, all the way down.
[4572.26s -> 4597.35s]  Let's go for two minutes. Clean. Right there. I can't use that anymore. I gotta wait like 10
[4597.35s -> 4635.13s]  seconds or so. Oh, this could be it. No, I might get it. That's it. 146. Damn it. Do this one now.
[4635.13s -> 4648.76s]  All the way down. All right. Star map. Have you seen all the memes about your stream getting
[4648.76s -> 4657.05s]  nuked the other day? Yeah. Yeah. And now there is a hard limiter on my computer. I, that ain't
[4657.05s -> 4690.41s]  happening again. Ever again. What's the deal with this one? Absorb it? Maybe. I generally hope you're
[4690.41s -> 4696.97s]  not too stressed out about that. It sucked. I had it on really loud, but I haven't, I still don't
[4696.97s -> 4702.78s]  know what happened. I, I, dude, I went, I did a full like diagnostic of my entire audio equipment
[4702.78s -> 4709.94s]  and system. Nothing. Nothing. But there's a limiter on the stream now. I ain't having that
[4709.94s -> 4716.76s]  happen again. Yeah. I've seen a lot of the memes and it's fun to laugh at them, right? Cause like
[4716.76s -> 4721.51s]  one of the things that we said is it sounded like somebody shot a grenade launcher into my room.
[4721.51s -> 4726.79s]  It's just like, it does. It really does. It sounds like I was like, it sounds like I was
[4726.79s -> 4734.54s]  fucking like somebody threw a grenade in here, but you gotta be careful with that kind of shit. That
[4734.54s -> 4740.44s]  shit is not good. And whether it was the game or the game communicating with the computer or
[4740.44s -> 4746.81s]  something, I don't know, but I ain't, that can't happen again. It was, that was fucking crazy.
[4747.75s -> 4755.94s]  What do I do here? Whether it was a rare, incredibly rare bug in devil may cry three
[4755.94s -> 4766.97s]  HD collection. I don't know if it is a rare bug like that though. Whoa. Whoa. Really? Like,
[4766.97s -> 4778.22s]  holy shit. That's, that's ridiculous. What do I do about this? I woke up laughing the next day
[4778.22s -> 4785.66s]  because it was so funny. I'm glad people think it's funny, but at the end of the day, that's,
[4786.38s -> 4790.22s]  you're going to be careful with that kind of shit. Maybe clones. Oh, I got to do.
[4799.56s -> 4813.43s]  It is clones. You haven't had a limiter this whole time. I have a limiter on my voice
[4814.39s -> 4821.61s]  and I usually have, so I have a thing where the audio is not supposed to go over a certain
[4821.61s -> 4828.73s]  threshold through OBS, but it, it went, it went through that. And I think it's because the amount
[4828.73s -> 4835.69s]  of sounds that were happening in a row, it didn't matter. It like went over the threshold, but now
[4836.33s -> 4845.10s]  I have it, I have it baked in. So that should be impossible now, but what a ridiculous bug.
[4845.74s -> 4880.41s]  I did it. Best time. Is that? Oh, I got it. I have 120 seconds. That one's going to be hard.
[4881.53s -> 4889.91s]  Ooh, I can just teleport. That's helpful. All right. This one's long time. Wait,
[4893.85s -> 4909.77s]  how does this work? How do I add time? This thing just, all right, this thing just turned on. That
[4909.77s -> 4932.02s]  was weird. Why did this one light up? Do I have to circle them? Clones maybe stand in both spots.
[4932.02s -> 4964.49s]  Let's try it. No. Yeah. When they bump it into the walls, it's when it's activating and I've
[4964.49s -> 4976.74s]  changed that. Can I move them? Can't make them change direction. I don't think I can absorb the
[4976.74s -> 4998.26s]  gold ones. Trying to do it right now. No, maybe I need a new power. This one's 20 seconds. I didn't
[4998.26s -> 5010.49s]  do. Let's change that. This one. I like this game. Are you breathing so weird? You can hear my
[5010.49s -> 5050.90s]  breathing. Oh my God. Breathing stream overlay, but there's like a little, like a little balloon
[5050.90s -> 5071.93s]  in the corner that inflates when I breathe in and deflates when I breathe out. I got it. What do I
[5071.93s -> 5098.71s]  need to go to the left room? Oh, it's from here. 120, 10 seconds. We can do that. Had to die to
[5098.71s -> 5108.90s]  that. You have to die to every single saw. Don't forget that. That would make it way easier for me
[5108.90s -> 5116.49s]  to be in sync with your breathing. Please do that. Plus two. Oh, you're the reason why I'm not going
[5116.49s -> 5160.60s]  to do it now. Hey, you do you. Yeah, you do you. I didn't even get it. Do a silent bob impression.
[5161.50s -> 5189.67s]  That's why I didn't even read that because okay, there you go. 20, 20. Let's get 20 right here.
[5189.67s -> 5224.57s]  Let's get 30. Yeah, that's what we call split second decision making. Whatever. This one's 10
[5224.57s -> 5246.09s]  seconds and feed. Feed what? Well, I'm going to die to this. I think I have to go inside of the
[5246.89s -> 5268.92s]  mouth. No, I would have met. Okay, it is. Yep. Feed it four times. Wait, what? That didn't count.
[5273.98s -> 5295.72s]  I get it. I get it. Wait. Okay. Yep. I have to pick up four of these. Get them both. Yes. All
[5295.72s -> 5306.41s]  right. That's it, right? Oh, my goodness. All right. We're fine. That's not it. It was four.
[5312.95s -> 5337.13s]  Yeah, I got it. All right. Now it's going to drive 10 seconds. I need to do your stand up.
[5337.13s -> 5346.26s]  I wouldn't last going to stand up. I'd get up there and I would tell one joke that I thought
[5346.26s -> 5352.12s]  was going to absolutely slay and it wouldn't. And then it would be over because that was my
[5352.12s -> 5357.24s]  best material. I would be like, I'm leading with the best thing I got. And it would be crickets.
[5357.24s -> 5362.20s]  And then I go, oh, fuck. Everything I'm about to say after this is not as good as the first
[5362.20s -> 5397.82s]  joke I just said. It's over. What do I do? I wish I had dash right now. Shit. I can do it.
[5397.82s -> 5405.72s]  Just give me a dash. You got to improve. Sometimes you got to sometimes you got a
[5405.72s -> 5411.37s]  bomb to improve. Yeah, no, that's true. I think that's accurate. I think like you got to,
[5412.54s -> 5423.77s]  you're never going to learn. Nobody starts out perfect. You got to, you got to learn, improve.
[5424.49s -> 5436.65s]  I figure out what works and doesn't work. Everybody gets it right the first time.
[5447.98s -> 5465.50s]  Allow yourself to grow. What do I always say? What do I always say? Yeah. You're part of the
[5465.50s -> 5494.60s]  story. I have to get 20 seconds on everything. What do you always say? You always say stones.
[5494.60s -> 5509.82s]  Yeah. Well, besides that, as other things I say, besides stones, stones, great movie.
[5510.38s -> 5538.55s]  Be greedy. I got it. Does it just keep getting harder and harder and harder and harder and
[5538.55s -> 5553.50s]  harder until you have to lose? I imagine so. Does each room have a completion survive 120 seconds?
[5556.79s -> 5568.58s]  This wants me to fast forward. Oh, I was going to say the, the DVD things never going in the corner.
[5579.40s -> 5619.61s]  It did. Oh shit. 120, right? 180. I thought it was 120. I was just lost right there.
[5624.39s -> 5648.06s]  Guys keep going. I'm just going to keep going. Wait, one, I was at 93. It's not 120, 60 plus.
[5648.06s -> 5654.31s]  Oh, I was reading the, whatever. It's two minutes, pal. What's with you guys today and calling me
[5654.31s -> 5661.11s]  pal and shit. Like, okay, pal. All right, buddy. Hey, listen, pal. Hey, buddy. What's going on here?
[5661.83s -> 5676.97s]  Hey, listen, pal. All right, bud. Hey, buddy. What'd he say? You don't call me your friend.
[5676.97s -> 5681.13s]  Don't call me your, don't call me your friend. I'm not your friend. Like, why is that? That's
[5681.13s -> 5684.57s]  so funny how they're like that. That's the thing to like really, you know, get into somebody's skin.
[5686.87s -> 5690.23s]  You know, you just called me a friend and pal and I'm not, I'm not your friend at all.
[5690.23s -> 5693.43s]  You don't even know it. Hey, don't say that. Call me your friend. I'm not a friend of yours.
[5694.15s -> 5718.94s]  How dare you call me a friend of yours. Okay, pal. See wise guy to me is, is not the same.
[5719.66s -> 5725.26s]  Wise guy is implying that I'm already upset with you. Hey, wise guy. Like, oh yeah. You're,
[5725.26s -> 5743.14s]  you're a wise guy. This is a baby game. Uh, this room is, is easier, but I wouldn't say that.
[5762.94s -> 5773.88s]  All right. I just go until I don't. Do you think it's possible that an alien could be watching
[5773.88s -> 5783.00s]  your stream? Uh, no, I don't think so. And a network reaching that far into space.
[5783.88s -> 5788.36s]  I mean, that would imply that the alien has some kind of wifi or why are you implying that there's
[5788.36s -> 5795.86s]  an alien here now among us is watching the stream. They're on earth is what you mean. What do you mean
[5795.86s -> 5813.90s]  like another planet? Oh, I maxed it out. Three minutes is the max. So this one, this little
[5813.90s -> 5837.96s]  disk in here I have to die to. What is it? Not that one. This purple one here. Nope. There we go.
[5837.96s -> 5860.41s]  All right. Now let's actually get it. You're the first pick for mankind to talk to the aliens.
[5860.41s -> 5874.39s]  Uh, what would your first choice of words be? Uh, that's a good question. Okay. Do they understand
[5874.39s -> 5882.07s]  me? Is there, is there a part of the movie or is there a part of the, the scenario you're,
[5882.07s -> 5889.91s]  you're painting here where the aliens go, hello human. Like they can talk like, oh yeah, we've,
[5889.91s -> 5894.78s]  now we know your, uh, your language now. Like they can just like, they sense it in there. Okay. Now
[5894.78s -> 5899.54s]  I can speak English. Is that what you're implying? So that we can talk to each other and they can
[5899.54s -> 5913.26s]  understand context, what I'm saying. Okay. Uh, first thing I would say is get out, get out while
[5913.26s -> 5917.34s]  you still can. This place is fucked. Get out of here. Leave quick. Leave quick. You got to get
[5917.34s -> 5920.14s]  out of here now. You got to get out of here now. I don't know what's going to happen. Get out of
[5920.14s -> 5934.55s]  here now. Quick. Abandon this place. Abandon it quick. That's probably the first thing I would say.
[5938.58s -> 5941.30s]  And then before they left, I'd be like, you got anything weird that you can give me that I can
[5941.30s -> 5952.63s]  sell for like a million dollars? And then say, take me with you. Take me with you. Take me with you.
[5954.20s -> 5959.80s]  Yeah. And they fly away and I'm like, oh yes, I get to finally go with the alien.
[5960.52s -> 5968.20s]  And the big beam comes down and I'm looking up. Oh, joyous of me. And they vaporize me.
[5968.20s -> 5977.37s]  That's that part of the movie. I don't know why this has to be a movie, but
[5977.93s -> 5988.06s]  I guess I just decided it was. How would you try to explain the sus guy meme to an alien who had
[5988.06s -> 5997.13s]  no prior knowledge of humanity? Hmm. Well, how do you explain humanity to an alien? What kind of
[5997.13s -> 6003.45s]  life form is this? They can understand me, but do they understand anything about the planet? Do
[6003.45s -> 6012.68s]  they know what water is? But I, we would have to start at zero. Like we drink this and eat stuff
[6012.68s -> 6020.28s]  or we die. This water here, this liquid in this glass, every single being on this planet
[6020.28s -> 6027.13s]  needs to consume a certain amount of this a day or we die. I think that's where you start.
[6027.13s -> 6034.12s]  Honestly, that's probably where you start. And then they go, interesting. Now we know exactly
[6034.12s -> 6042.04s]  what to obliterate. First, go for the water source. No, no, no, no, no. No, you bastard alien.
[6043.08s -> 6065.02s]  How dare you. Take me with you. Take me with you. This room is fucking crazy. What? I need slowdown.
[6065.66s -> 6083.27s]  Yeah, we already went over how hot sauce would be an act of war. We already talked about what food
[6083.27s -> 6088.23s]  or what beverage you should not give an alien because they're going to see it as like an attack.
[6089.03s -> 6105.45s]  How would you explain porn to aliens? I don't know. I don't know. You probably feel like
[6107.38s -> 6110.50s]  what would they wouldn't be. I don't know. What kind of life form is this?
[6111.22s -> 6117.86s]  I don't think they'd even do they know what sex is. Would they? I don't know. What kind of life
[6117.86s -> 6125.78s]  form is it? Not again. Not again. Not again. All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's start
[6125.78s -> 6148.58s]  with the subway or whatever. Oh my goodness. This was hard. Okay. Explain this to them.
[6148.58s -> 6154.50s]  This is great, Dr. Clay. This is fucking hilarious. Okay. This is actually like a 10 out of 10 joke
[6154.50s -> 6158.10s]  from Dr. Clay. I got it for this. We got to talk about this because yeah.
[6160.36s -> 6178.55s]  Okay. Dr. Clay says, how would you explain this to the aliens? Okay. Let's try. Hold on. I got to
[6178.55s -> 6207.50s]  save it. Okay. How do we describe this? Save it. It's annoying. I'm just going to try to drag it
[6207.50s -> 6220.94s]  from here. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. Excuse me, human. What is this? Well, I mean,
[6222.30s -> 6235.51s]  I mean, it's a video game where we were shooting and killing. Well, do you find this amusing
[6235.51s -> 6249.72s]  to shoot and kill aliens? No, of course not. You see, those are frogs. What is a frog? Oh,
[6250.44s -> 6255.56s]  it's a life form here and it's a frog. And that's just like a jokey. We like, oh, look, it's a frog.
[6255.56s -> 6262.10s]  So you think it's funny? You think frogs are something that you kill? No, no, no, no, no,
[6262.10s -> 6267.77s]  we don't. I find that to be fucking disgusting and not amusing at all. In fact, this looks
[6267.77s -> 6281.50s]  kind of like Jerry. Jerry's like standing behind him. No, of course it's not. They're crabs.
[6281.50s -> 6284.46s]  Imagine if space invaders was the thing that got us like alien nuked.
[6296.66s -> 6313.80s]  That's like, yeah, that's like incredibly insensitive to the aliens. Right? That is the
[6313.80s -> 6330.06s]  plot of pixels. What? Oh, they're it's little cartoon characters. They're not real. It's not
[6330.06s -> 6334.06s]  it's not a thing. It's they're not what I don't even understand what they're supposed to be
[6334.06s -> 6339.43s]  depicting. First, you said it was some type of animal, which was ridiculous to even consider
[6339.43s -> 6344.86s]  that concept. Yeah, I'm sorry. Honestly, I'm just trying to make it so you don't fucking shoot me
[6344.86s -> 6371.13s]  with that thing you're pointing at me. Take me with you. Take me with you. This is hard.
[6371.13s -> 6381.96s]  You got to go quick because the longer this takes. OK, go. Come on. It's right there.
[6386.01s -> 6416.15s]  No, coward, coward move. Seriously. Damn it. I did it already. I don't care. I would be in 20
[6416.15s -> 6422.76s]  seconds. It can be the one room I don't do. Humanity is going to delete our entire media
[6422.76s -> 6429.06s]  catalog when the aliens show up. Yeah, there are a lot of media about how aliens we wipe them out.
[6429.75s -> 6435.19s]  They show up and we try to get rid of them as fast as possible. They're awful. We like hate
[6435.19s -> 6442.63s]  aliens. We hate them. We hate aliens. We paint them in such this crazy light where they show up
[6442.63s -> 6452.94s]  and fucking kill all of us and we have to kill them. How would we explain the thousands of
[6452.94s -> 6462.97s]  pieces of media about how much aliens are are are terrible and they're here to kill us all?
[6462.97s -> 6467.05s]  Or I feel like if you were an alien, you'd show up and you would see some of this shit and be like,
[6467.05s -> 6473.59s]  we need to get the fuck out of here, man. This is what they think we're doing. This is what
[6473.59s -> 6477.11s]  they think that we need to get out of here as soon as possible. We let's go to the next one.
[6477.83s -> 6495.45s]  I don't think I can do this. Let's go up here. Defeat all four different antibodies in a row.
[6495.45s -> 6512.49s]  How do I do that? How come you made the aliens stop sounding like nerds?
[6513.13s -> 6519.42s]  Because I want to stay alive when they show up. They're going to watch my stream and they're
[6519.42s -> 6525.86s]  going to be like, why did he make us sound like that? Why are we standing straight up?
[6527.99s -> 6532.47s]  Why is our posture always straight up? And we always have this kind of a voice.
[6532.55s -> 6537.38s]  That's not that's nothing what we're like. Why did you do that? You don't understand.
[6541.90s -> 6551.69s]  You called them idiots. Take me with you. Take me with you. I promise. I'm a good human.
[6554.31s -> 6559.83s]  And I go down, right? I'm like, no, please. I go down on my knees. Take me with you. No,
[6560.79s -> 6565.03s]  you don't want any of the other humans. They're awful. They're terribly filthy.
[6585.30s -> 6592.68s]  But here's another thing, right? In reality, what do you do with the take me with you guy?
[6593.24s -> 6599.82s]  If the aliens leave, right? What do you do with the take me with you guy?
[6603.46s -> 6613.85s]  Do I get in trouble? Right? Do I do I get like arrested for that? The aliens show up and I'm
[6613.85s -> 6619.37s]  like, take me with you. Leave. Leave with me and all these awful, horrible pieces of shit.
[6619.37s -> 6624.97s]  This filthy fucking humans on this planet. Take me with you. And then the ship goes away and it's
[6624.97s -> 6631.14s]  like, hey, dude, what the fuck was up with that? And what the hell do we do about that?
[6633.58s -> 6658.39s]  You okay? Work stress. Sorry. Somebody said, I say I hate humans all the time. Yeah, that's
[6658.39s -> 6666.36s]  yeah. But I think this would be this is more real, right? If the aliens show up and you're
[6666.36s -> 6678.57s]  like actively wanting to work with the aliens, does that turn out to be like treason to humanity?
[6691.66s -> 6703.06s]  It's not illegal to want to leave Earth. Yeah, I know. All right. Does that change if
[6704.42s -> 6713.06s]  all right. But how does that change for you guys? Like, okay, so does it change for you if
[6714.42s -> 6721.38s]  the aliens land and the take me with you guy goes and walks over to the other side where the
[6721.38s -> 6726.06s]  aliens are turns around and stands with them shoulder to shoulder and is like, huh, does that
[6726.06s -> 6755.61s]  change it for you? No. Why would it? Does it? What does he kill other humans? Huh? Yeah. What's the
[6755.61s -> 6761.13s]  line though? What's the line for you have joined the aliens and now the aliens left?
[6763.48s -> 6779.00s]  Where's the line? Are the aliens killing people? Yeah, let's let's talk about like,
[6779.00s -> 6784.74s]  like a total takeover alien invasion scenario. And now take me with you guy is there.
[6797.43s -> 6804.89s]  Are the aliens evil? All right. Let me beat this level and we'll talk. Are the
[6805.05s -> 6830.79s]  aliens hot? Uh, I don't. That's a good question. All right. Let's say they are.
[6833.78s -> 6841.40s]  Let's say the aliens. Let's say they let's say they are. How many of you are going to be the
[6841.40s -> 6852.44s]  take me with you guy for girl? Huh? Oh, no. Now we got a whole lot of traitors to humanity here now.
[6852.44s -> 6856.76s]  Very interesting. Now we got some traitors to humanity all of a sudden because the aliens
[6856.76s -> 6887.94s]  are hot. Very interesting. All right. I gotta beat this level. Did someone say that the aliens
[6887.94s -> 6908.90s]  party? Um, no, not at all. Not in the slightest. Sorry. Childish behavior. What is this party?
[6910.30s -> 6919.35s]  Loud sound effects come out of device. Beverages are served that make you stupid. What is this
[6919.35s -> 6940.15s]  nonsense? Yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah. But then that happens. But then one of the aliens during
[6940.15s -> 6947.91s]  the course of the time, during the course of the movie or whatever is seen smoking out of a bong.
[6948.47s -> 6965.94s]  You know what I'm saying? They got to cut to one of these aliens smoking out of a bong.
[6965.94s -> 6974.63s]  And that alien is the one that joins the humans. But what the hell you've got all this alien
[6974.63s -> 6979.19s]  technology and you've got, you're so smart and you, you know everything about the aliens,
[6979.19s -> 6984.79s]  but you're just smoking a bong as a comedy character. Fuck. We can't get you to help us
[6984.79s -> 6988.63s]  at all. Even though you're on our team, you're the comic relief of this whole scenario,
[6993.32s -> 6998.28s]  but we have that alien here. That's, that's on our team. Oh, but he's like looking fucking high
[6998.28s -> 7011.18s]  over there and he's, he's got like red eyes and he can't help us. Dude. This happens in the movie
[7011.18s -> 7024.30s]  Paul. Oh, nice. Okay. What is this movie, Paul? What is the subject matter of this movie?
[7025.02s -> 7044.44s]  All right. I got it. I don't know what this defeat all four in a row though that you just
[7044.44s -> 7058.50s]  described literally the exact, the whole movie. That's the whole movie. Is this movie 15 minutes?
[7062.39s -> 7067.58s]  Please beat the level. Are you even trying? Please dodge the attacks. I just want to see
[7067.58s -> 7083.98s]  the gameplay. This person's watching the stream muted. This would be an unbearable muted. Yeah,
[7083.98s -> 7093.59s]  that's true. Okay. Defeat. How do I, I got one. Do I just have to pick them up really fast?
[7098.65s -> 7108.31s]  One, maybe just really fast. I don't get it. Eat all four different antibodies in a row.
[7110.87s -> 7115.03s]  Watch the Paul trailer. I'm curious. I need to know. I don't, I don't, I remember this movie
[7115.03s -> 7142.01s]  coming out. Let's watch the Paul trailer. Okay. Hold on. All official trailer. Are we about to
[7142.01s -> 7148.84s]  watch everything we just talked about? That's, I'm going to laugh my ass off if that's the case.
[7148.84s -> 7182.62s]  Okay. Hold on. Let me get it at HD. It's not even in HD. This is 360p video. All right,
[7182.62s -> 7196.81s]  let's give it a watch. I got to mute this. Let's see if it is, it is word for word,
[7196.81s -> 7231.56s]  the exact scenario we just said. Okay. Three, two. They do exist.
[7250.89s -> 7251.53s]  They don't do that.
[7256.73s -> 7260.57s]  I'm closing in. I can feel it in 24 hours. He's going to wish he never set foot on planet Earth.
[7260.57s -> 7264.41s]  I want that little green prick dead ASAP. Hi there.
[7270.97s -> 7275.13s]  I got my people primed and ready to pick me up. So what happens if you get caught?
[7275.77s -> 7276.81s]  I'm going to cut out my brain.
[7280.01s -> 7284.49s]  Buzzkill. Let's lighten the mood. Shall we Clive? When did you last get laid?
[7286.17s -> 7290.17s]  The individual that you're traveling with is highly dangerous. He's not dangerous. He's kind
[7290.17s -> 7296.38s]  of rude. This is small on my planet. A couple of times I've seen him scratch his face and
[7298.54s -> 7303.10s]  why was that edited? That was weirdly edited. Sometimes I've seen him scratch his space man
[7303.10s -> 7308.76s]  balls. This is small. A couple of times I've seen him scratch his space fan balls.
[7308.76s -> 7312.28s]  Why do they edit and splice them together weirdly? She's talking about space man balls.
[7314.86s -> 7318.38s]  We look like a family. Hey, we're just a couple of regular guys walking down the street.
[7318.38s -> 7327.80s]  Where's the bong? Where's the bong?
[7329.08s -> 7330.92s]  This is the most fun I have ever had.
[7332.92s -> 7334.76s]  I like this song. Stoke the fire.
[7334.76s -> 7340.70s]  There's no bong in this movie.
[7359.21s -> 7362.41s]  There's no bong in that movie. You did that joke. This is you.
[7363.13s -> 7371.98s]  I'm going to watch that. I'm watching that movie like tonight. Bro, this is the trailer.
[7378.47s -> 7401.00s]  All right. Let's get going. You've done that bit before. Yeah. Well, come on. It's true. He
[7401.00s -> 7404.54s]  smokes weed. I'm going to watch the movie. I'll come back to you. I'm going to give you. I'm going
[7404.94s -> 7410.39s]  to. I will live. I will give live notes to the movie call and I'll come back to you.
[7410.39s -> 7427.75s]  This one doesn't have a. It's kind of loud. There we go. One hour.
[7429.30s -> 7455.00s]  Holy shit. That's a long time. An hour. Please live tweet it. I got it.
[7462.39s -> 7476.01s]  Dermot, why are you such an anti-noise old lady now? What does that mean?
[7481.46s -> 7518.06s]  Ooh, new power. And I actually think I need to die to this. No, wait, what? Just do it.
[7518.06s -> 7525.99s]  There's still two things I didn't die to in here. That one's no.
[7535.46s -> 7538.82s]  This is a good one. I'm putting this on the stream for a minute. I like this one.
[7571.40s -> 7576.20s]  You would have no idea how often this happens, though. I do this almost every single night.
[7581.82s -> 7590.70s]  I told you this before. It sucks so bad. If this is a warning to you all, stop, get off of
[7590.70s -> 7598.22s]  YouTube shorts, get off of TikTok. And I'm telling you why. Those of you that scroll that shit in
[7598.22s -> 7606.94s]  bed, you can relate to this. And I've done it only a few times, but my God, I have fallen asleep
[7606.94s -> 7614.14s]  to a YouTube short that just doesn't ever end over and over and over and over. It never stops
[7614.14s -> 7622.73s]  in a place for like four hours. It's just like, get it. Can you set a limit to how much something
[7622.73s -> 7634.44s]  can play? Is it like, OK, after 50 times, it should stop. Does it just loop forever? And then
[7634.44s -> 7641.00s]  I wake up and it's just burnt in my brain, this 25 second clip of just the exact same
[7641.00s -> 7651.42s]  cadences in the beat and the whole thing. It's just TikTok will tell you to take a break after
[7651.42s -> 7661.85s]  an hour. Instagram stops after two hours and your phone is at zero percent. It should be like
[7663.05s -> 7671.43s]  10 times or like 100 times. Like that's a lot. What is the original pic?
[7671.43s -> 7677.37s]  The original picture is me watching XQC play slots.
[7691.34s -> 7718.36s]  You're a mega fan. What is this room? What is this? God, how long did it say?
[7718.36s -> 7751.22s]  Give me some stimulation. I am. Oh, I'll try to get 30. Yeah, I fall asleep to something sitting
[7751.22s -> 7764.60s]  on my chest every single night. And it just that iPad just sits there and God have mercy on your
[7764.60s -> 7791.75s]  soul. If it is a YouTube short for a TikTok. And then do you guys do this too? Where you
[7791.75s -> 7800.49s]  you refuse to give it up. You'll wake up with one eye open and painfully put this like decrepit
[7800.57s -> 7809.29s]  finger out and slowly push the screen up and then slowly go back to bed.
[7813.85s -> 7818.73s]  I almost feel like it's one of those like an old man finger from like the old animated movies
[7818.73s -> 7826.17s]  where it's like a bony and bent and like it's like all decrepit and the fingernail is like
[7826.17s -> 7840.78s]  five inches long and you know what's going to happen. But for some reason you don't just
[7840.78s -> 7848.70s]  turn it off. Just close the just close it. Just get off YouTube. Why? No, I just I want to see.
[7849.66s -> 7855.26s]  I want to see what the next food hack is real quick and then I'm going right to bed. I swear.
[7857.42s -> 7867.70s]  Oh, oh, that's how they do it. Please repeat 100 times in my sleep and fuck up my dreams
[7868.87s -> 7887.53s]  and screw up my brain in the process. Shit. I did it. I did it. I don't need to do it again.
[7887.53s -> 7895.98s]  I already got it. What's the criteria for this one? Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms.
[7895.98s -> 7914.68s]  This is how I watch your streams. That's that's fine. That's cool. That doesn't bother me. One's
[7914.68s -> 7949.72s]  10 seconds. Are you going to do anything when you're going to play a Miku game? I don't know.
[7949.72s -> 7961.38s]  When's the next Miku game coming out? I don't know. What's the first thing you'd show an alien?
[7961.38s -> 7989.35s]  Miku Miku concert. All right. There's equal parts of my brain would say the alien would turn to you
[7989.35s -> 7998.98s]  and go. I hate this or turn to you and go. Your planet is now saved. We are going to move on.
[7998.98s -> 8011.19s]  Carry on with everything you're doing here. It's all up to speed with us. That's a 50 50 coin flip.
[8011.19s -> 8016.94s]  That's either a planet gets obliterated or we get new alien technology. I don't know if that's worth
[8016.94s -> 8046.31s]  the risk. This one is die with over four disks in the room. OK, there's only two. How do I get more
[8046.31s -> 8064.90s]  of these to come out? Sir, die with over four disks in the room. Absorb. What are the zero?
[8068.22s -> 8083.85s]  Wait, am I spawning them? That was weird. I kind of OK, I can spawn them, but I don't know.
[8083.85s -> 8097.48s]  I don't know. Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms. OK, so we're not quite there yet.
[8097.48s -> 8105.43s]  Defeat or gatekeepers. This will end your current. Whoa, no, no, no, no. Wait, what? Wait a minute.
[8106.58s -> 8120.28s]  This is based on runs. So end your current run. Wait, what's going on? Am I out of am I out of
[8120.28s -> 8136.50s]  run tokens or something? This will end your run. Oh, OK, I was OK. I get it. For a second,
[8136.50s -> 8145.69s]  I thought it was I was ending my game. I was going to start over or something.
[8145.69s -> 8152.78s]  He is so stoned right now. No, I'm not. I'm not. I just have massive attention problems.
[8174.78s -> 8181.50s]  Dude, you're definitely high. No, I have not. I have not consumed any cannabis products since
[8181.50s -> 8204.17s]  the Saw 2 stream. I think on stream, I can do way longer than that. Defeat four gatekeepers.
[8204.17s -> 8223.34s]  All right, this one more boss somewhere. Let me try to get to a minute. Oh, that was weird.
[8223.34s -> 8231.38s]  I got 20 seconds of art. Defeat all four different antibodies in a row. I don't get that one.
[8232.10s -> 8245.02s]  You have to die from everything. Second I see a new song, I'm going to die from it.
[8257.34s -> 8265.80s]  Oh, it's right there. Old one. You like about doing weed on stream for that one or not?
[8265.80s -> 8269.96s]  You both said you were high during that stream and not. Oh, you must have missed when I when
[8269.96s -> 8288.09s]  I told everybody that I lied. Yeah, you're thinking of the Hitman level and Hitman 3.
[8288.09s -> 8292.73s]  There was a level that was this big concrete level that I was walking around in circles and
[8292.73s -> 8296.17s]  it was it was awful for me. I couldn't figure it out. I was really frustrated.
[8296.97s -> 8300.25s]  So everyone was like, dude, you have to be high. And I was like, yeah, yeah, I am.
[8300.25s -> 8304.97s]  Yeah, you got me. I just made that up. That did not happen. That was I made it up.
[8305.69s -> 8336.70s]  Give me that. I have to I have to get hit by this gold one. Nice. OK, honestly, the last time that I
[8336.70s -> 8351.74s]  was truly inebriated on stream, like inebriated, like really inebriated was probably, I don't know,
[8351.74s -> 8362.71s]  maybe at some point mid last year, last year, not this year at all. It hasn't happened at all since
[8368.26s -> 8373.14s]  Resident Evil 7. No, it definitely was after that, too. That was that was a long time ago.
[8377.69s -> 8385.77s]  One of the V.R. streams probably I always drink during the V.R. streams, which is both the best
[8385.77s -> 8423.72s]  and worst idea ever. Period cart. Um, I don't I wasn't really I'm talking like drunk. Is it Morrowind?
[8423.72s -> 8428.12s]  I don't know. I don't remember. It's been long enough where I really don't remember.
[8428.68s -> 8438.36s]  And it is the infamous Minecraft run. Yeah.
[8451.08s -> 8462.18s]  No, fuck. I already got 20 seconds. Who cares? What about the Among Us stream?
[8465.16s -> 8469.91s]  No, I don't think I I don't think I was doing anything on that.
[8471.80s -> 8474.76s]  Did I have a few drinks during the Among Us V.R. stream? I don't think so.
[8479.37s -> 8487.21s]  Yeah, I was I was sick. Yeah, I had like I think I think I had covid. Yeah. Or I did I have covid at
[8487.21s -> 8508.65s]  that point. That was around that time. Yeah, it was during the covid. Yeah. This one is pretty
[8508.65s -> 8519.38s]  difficult. I need to get to 20. Damn it gets so overwhelmed. I might actually do the clones with
[8519.38s -> 8536.87s]  this one. You're going to play Among Us again? No, probably not. I don't think so. All right,
[8536.87s -> 8563.02s]  there's 10. Damn, this one is hard to get to 20. Am I collecting them too fast? What's the what's
[8563.02s -> 8585.62s]  the issue here? You got to be faster. I think you're right. I think it's all about speed.
[8586.18s -> 8600.68s]  That would have been sick if I had done it. I don't know if I get this one.
[8615.46s -> 8640.89s]  Shit. Maybe I'm going to be slow. You beat Virgil. You can do this. That's true. Yeah,
[8640.89s -> 8668.46s]  it's it's definitely slow. Fuck. I only use the slow when I'm at at least 10 to 12 seconds.
[8668.46s -> 8740.06s]  Holy shit. This was really hard. Damn it. All right, come on. Let's go. Yes. Got it. Let's go.
[8740.06s -> 8748.94s]  Yes. Let's go. There was no enthusiasm on that one. What was the problem with this one?
[8748.94s -> 8758.20s]  Oh, yeah. And one of you guys can do this. 20 seconds in the room. That's fish black. No.
[8758.20s -> 8771.05s]  Ignoring. Ignoring what? Phantom gatekeeper. Do I die? OK, there's one song here I didn't die to.
[8771.05s -> 8783.37s]  Not that one. It doesn't even read chat. No, I mean, maybe like once like once or twice a stream.
[8783.37s -> 8813.16s]  I'll look over and be like, I'll read like one or two words. We recorded. It's my birthday.
[8818.20s -> 8865.78s]  I mean, it's been yes. Oh, I want to announce this because I know people have been waiting
[8865.78s -> 8876.39s]  for this real announcement. Ladies and gentlemen, at some point in the middle of June, Sorcery
[8877.03s -> 8887.93s]  will return. We'll do a recap. We can figure out exactly what was going on and where we were.
[8888.57s -> 8896.09s]  Sorcery is coming back. I'm actually going to play the third episode. No bullshit. I'm going to play
[8896.09s -> 8906.47s]  it. Sit back with a nice hot cup of coffee. Just relax. Play a choose your own adventure game.
[8914.22s -> 8961.98s]  Oh, that's sad. Damn it. I need that. Sorcery equals dog shit. I just want to make sure you
[8961.98s -> 8968.49s]  understand. You just sided with the aliens in this chat. That's a that's a treasonous statement to
[8968.49s -> 8976.18s]  humanity. Now you have to start spamming. Take me with you quick. Take me with you.
[8988.38s -> 9032.52s]  There we go. What's this? That guy's brave. Yeah, we're getting close. Die from 45 different disc
[9032.52s -> 9057.22s]  types. There's still one in here that I didn't die to. When's the hexes and spells stream? I need
[9057.22s -> 9073.85s]  to request work off for that. I still don't understand this one. They die from 45 different
[9073.85s -> 9099.29s]  disc types. Does that count as one? There it is. Absorb discs and bring them into the other room.
[9099.29s -> 9107.54s]  See, now you are thinking you are thinking. That's that's a lot of thought. Does that actually
[9107.54s -> 9118.71s]  work? OK, so now I'm going to die. Or do I have to beat the level? Well, I can't beat the level.
[9118.71s -> 9134.76s]  OK, let's die. I just fuck it up. I might have. OK, now kill me. OK, it does work. It do exist.
[9135.32s -> 9176.74s]  OK. Wow. Wait, what? There's only three. Hmm. Get a disc that duplicates. That's very smart.
[9176.74s -> 9182.26s]  I'll come back. All right. Ten seconds. Survive for 10 seconds. Oh, this is different.
[9182.26s -> 9194.82s]  All right. Survive for 10 seconds. Do I have to clear this? I wonder what this means.
[9195.38s -> 9213.30s]  I don't think I have to do this. It's kind of cool, though. Yes, I do. It's the only way to make
[9213.30s -> 9226.97s]  time go up. I would kick your ass and swindle stones. I'm sorry. Nobody is as full of shit as
[9226.97s -> 9250.94s]  me. So I can guarantee you that is one thing that I know I would beat anybody in this room.
[9250.94s -> 9266.90s]  It's swindle stones. If I didn't have to be in the same room as other people and not be like
[9267.86s -> 9277.34s]  and like turn red and shit like I would be so good at poker. I'd be amazing at poker.
[9277.90s -> 9286.87s]  I'm Mr. Albertson. It's time for you to bet. I have to do the thing. I've got like I got pocket
[9286.87s -> 9293.35s]  aces. I'd be like. And I start turning purple and shit and people would be like, oh, I know he's
[9293.35s -> 9305.37s]  I know what he has. It's so funny. That's one of those things where, oh, hey, don't tell anybody
[9305.45s -> 9314.68s]  what you have. You're going to win. I don't have anything. Could you could I. All right.
[9315.48s -> 9320.57s]  Could I wear like a ski mask? Would that be like, OK, could I wear like a mask?
[9325.14s -> 9333.08s]  No, you can't. So but you're allowed to wear sunglasses at a poker table.
[9334.12s -> 9339.46s]  Why couldn't I wear like a why couldn't I put on like a Ronald Reagan mask or something?
[9340.02s -> 9350.34s]  Or how big can the sunglasses be? Could I have gigantic, goofy sunglasses that cover
[9350.34s -> 9363.64s]  my whole face? You can't hide your face is put as isn't sunglasses hiding your face.
[9364.36s -> 9382.33s]  Give me a new power. This is not good here with an alien mask.
[9383.06s -> 9386.34s]  No, I'm talking about like a private poker tournament, like a poker tournament or something
[9389.43s -> 9405.72s]  where a full fursuit. Damn it. This one's kind of hard. Slow would be best for this one.
[9409.03s -> 9417.80s]  There's no time. So let's do it slow or those in a timer. They might be.
[9431.51s -> 9484.04s]  Fuck slow. It's definitely slow for sure. Oh, if I was in like a private poker tournament
[9484.04s -> 9488.89s]  and I had like a voice changer and a ski mask on stuff, people would still know what I had.
[9488.89s -> 9492.81s]  The only difference is instead of it being you could see, you could still see my expressions
[9492.81s -> 9514.41s]  and stuff instead of being like, oh, it would be like, oh, oh, last. I still didn't do this one.
[9514.41s -> 9541.38s]  20. Does it cost to do that? It doesn't. That's a big deal. I'm trying to use it too often.
[9552.81s -> 9560.60s]  No, give me slow. Wait, maybe carve the middle out first so I don't have to go as far.
[9560.60s -> 9583.38s]  But no, go on the edge first. Damn it. I can. It's really this one's not even that hard. It's just
[9583.38s -> 9588.39s]  they're doing the same pattern as the spiders and Isaac. And you know that I can't handle those.
[9589.11s -> 9612.12s]  It's that erratic like pause, go pause, go pause, go pause, go damn it. I had it.
[9612.12s -> 9624.14s]  Come on. I got it. I got it. Not even three out yet. Here we go. I think you imbecile.
[9624.14s -> 9647.74s]  That one was stuck up there in the top and I just fuck. That's another villain word.
[9648.82s -> 9665.24s]  Imbecile, imbecile, imbecile, imbecile. This is one of those that I have to get 20 seconds
[9665.24s -> 9685.45s]  or I refuse to move on because I'm so close. I know I'll get it. No, I thought it was going
[9685.45s -> 9720.62s]  to go the other way. OK, go. Yeah. OK, thank goodness. 10 seconds in this one.
[9720.62s -> 9746.09s]  You should play Google Snake. Snake infuriates me. What was that snake game? It's an EO.
[9746.09s -> 9751.21s]  It's an EO game. I played it for a little while and I was obsessed with it.
[9752.20s -> 9759.94s]  Yes, slither, slither, slither. Yep, slitherio. I was obsessed with it and it was I hated it at
[9759.94s -> 9767.06s]  the same time. You would get huge and then somebody would just do that thing. Some little
[9767.06s -> 9774.58s]  new spawn Andy would just fly in front of you and drive next to you, next to you, next to you,
[9774.58s -> 9786.06s]  cut in front of you. This has ruined everything. And you know, you're sitting there thinking like,
[9786.06s -> 9791.30s]  all right, buddy, you got to work your way up. You're coming to the big leagues right now.
[9792.10s -> 9797.53s]  Get out of here. What do you think you're doing? Right? Like that's a what? That's a who do you
[9797.53s -> 9804.86s]  think you are scenario? Who do you think you are? My name's up on the leaderboard. Yours isn't. You
[9804.86s -> 9816.41s]  just spawned. Get out of here. What do you think you are? Who do you think you are? I am. That's a
[9816.41s -> 9833.48s]  great video. All right, I'll take 29. Still two discs. I had to get hit by survive five seconds
[9833.48s -> 9852.31s]  in all unlocked rooms. What was this one? I think I could probably get it. This is going to be like
[9852.31s -> 9858.84s]  annoying to look at though. So it's going to be kind of hard in the eyes. Just be aware of that.
[9859.48s -> 9888.68s]  It's already over. Damn it. What was this one? Survive 10 seconds in all unlocked rooms. Survive
[9888.68s -> 9901.34s]  90 seconds total in this zone. Play Breath of the Wild. I stubbed my toe last night and it
[9901.34s -> 9917.45s]  really hurts. I don't think I can. I don't think I can perform that well. Play tears of the kingdom
[9917.45s -> 9924.94s]  then instead. I would. I just, I said I have an appointment I have to get to. It's an important
[9924.94s -> 9932.22s]  one so I have to get to it. When did you say you wanted me to stop by? When did you want me to do
[9932.22s -> 9945.56s]  that? When? What time? What time did you want me to? What time is it? Like 7 30 is when you want to be?
[9946.60s -> 9954.47s]  That's that's fucking crazy. My appointment is at 7 45 but I'm not gonna do man. Sorry.
[9956.30s -> 9961.98s]  Wow. Shit luck. What? I was thinking about doing it. I was thinking about playing it at 7 45. I
[9961.98s -> 9977.06s]  have to. I have an appointment I have to get to. That's what's weird. That's crazy. He's done this
[9977.06s -> 9987.27s]  bit before you can tell. I'm sure I have. I don't know. I mean unironically I do. There is a lot of
[9987.27s -> 9995.78s]  work to do this week. Okay. Like on a completely unironically. There's a lot going on this week.
[9995.78s -> 10000.42s]  So I mean that's hey I can't play. I cannot play Breath of the Wild or tears of the kingdom.
[10001.22s -> 10018.22s]  A lot going on. Okay. I want to absorb one of these because does that does that count as
[10018.22s -> 10035.48s]  four? You got time for disc world. This game is called disc room. Just say you don't like it and
[10035.48s -> 10044.89s]  move on. I do. I'm just fucking around. Guys I cannot start tears of the kingdom which is like a
[10044.89s -> 10066.34s]  6 000 hour game before I beat the first 1500 hour game and beat it already. Yeah but I just don't
[10066.34s -> 10083.75s]  want to right now. I got a lot to do still. You don't start the first Hobbit movie then skip to
[10083.75s -> 10108.78s]  the next one. I actually feel like you kind of do. No you don't. I'm making a dumb joke. Absorb it.
[10108.78s -> 10124.68s]  All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. So this is going to count as four discs right.
[10124.68s -> 10143.08s]  It's going to spam a bunch. There it is. Thank you. Thank you. Wait what? I would. Can I just do it?
[10143.08s -> 10166.73s]  How come that didn't count? It just said I had it. I just said I did it. That's weird. With a gold
[10166.73s -> 10192.26s]  one. Okay. I just picked up a gold one. What is it? Will that? Can I bring that somewhere? Die with
[10192.26s -> 10211.30s]  four discs in the room. I guess I'll just do this one. When I unlock everything I'll probably have
[10211.30s -> 10225.88s]  a clear picture of what to do. I wonder if there's a final boss. How did you find this game? Um uh
[10225.88s -> 10275.05s]  there's a game path. What's wrong with that? Game pass. What's wrong with that? Oh I almost had it.
[10275.05s -> 10307.00s]  I mean it's a month and you get access to games and game pass is actually good. Yeah yes it is.
[10307.00s -> 10327.72s]  Um at that person say that you're fucking awesome. You know what I mean? Are the elder
[10327.72s -> 10342.82s]  wilds dlc? Oh I I really liked outer wilds. I was really confused by it though. I heard the dlc was
[10342.82s -> 10350.58s]  more confusing. I got it. There we go. Oh shit we're almost to the last few rooms.
[10350.58s -> 10370.79s]  All right this is out of 25. What is this? Well I need to die from that. It is but a guide is acceptable.
[10370.79s -> 10376.60s]  Okay. I mean as long as if I could use a guide and people wouldn't be like wow dude
[10377.24s -> 10403.10s]  you stink. I mean you guys would say that anyways but shit. These need to spread out. I'm gonna get
[10403.10s -> 10453.48s]  killed. This dude smells like a game pass. Damn it. Come on stop. I can do this. 25. You stupid.
[10453.48s -> 10458.86s]  You hate sorcery? I just gave you a date. I said when I was playing sorcery. I gave you a hard date.
[10458.86s -> 10485.02s]  June something. Oh my goodness. All right come on. Stop. It's it's not even hard because they
[10485.02s -> 10521.50s]  change cores. I need to do it. It's objective. It has to be done. Oh my god. They just track you.
[10521.50s -> 10533.99s]  Can you finish tf2? Do you know I got this massive craving for a man versus machine because I saw
[10533.99s -> 10539.42s]  that overwatch was just like oh no we're not really doing that anymore. I was like oh well
[10548.14s -> 10552.78s]  it's funny that was the one thing that I really actually wanted to play in overwatch
[10552.78s -> 10557.82s]  if in overwatch 2. I was like oh okay that's the only reason why I would play overwatch 2.
[10557.82s -> 10563.96s]  That was my sole reason to play it because like I don't I mean I had fun with overwatch
[10564.98s -> 10568.92s]  but then I was saying when they said oh we're doing a pve thing I'm thinking you're talking
[10568.92s -> 10572.28s]  about man versus machine is that what you're talking about is that what you mean by that
[10572.28s -> 10579.99s]  because if that's what you mean by that you've got I'm signed up now so hearing that it was
[10579.99s -> 10595.72s]  kind of not really what they're doing anymore was well now I but I want to do that oh oh it's
[10595.72s -> 10608.14s]  right there yes 13 out of 25 what does that mean 13 is it how many of these get spawned

[11697.93s -> 11713.50s]  hard hard all right but I let's try it survive 10 seconds new game plus yeah you gotta go backwards
[11713.50s -> 11722.86s]  it seems wait there's okay if the other player dies do I lose because that makes this way worse
[11731.38s -> 11741.96s]  I don't know I can't tell I didn't lose I guess it's still fine maybe not it's hard to tell
[11741.96s -> 11775.61s]  this one yeah this is definitely way harder geez okay yeah I think you just go backwards
[11775.61s -> 11785.67s]  it's kind of like uh what dark world and meat boy what about your appointment

[11981.29s -> 12005.06s]  that have been put out I don't want to okay then yeah I don't want to
[12009.59s -> 12035.13s]  I have to get 20 seconds in the dark world or I'm gonna be pissed is it even possible for the
[12035.13s -> 12041.30s]  purple yeah I don't even know if the purple character can live maybe that might be a part
[12041.30s -> 12057.35s]  of a really really hard challenge each room the purple character has to stay alive all right one
[12057.35s -> 12067.06s]  more try and I'm moving on this is too addicting this is the kind of stuff that I would have played
[12069.11s -> 12086.58s]  just in my bedroom all night I would not have stopped an old flash game oh I'm in trouble
[12087.14s -> 12113.10s]  this would have ruined my sleep in high school yeah damn it honestly the corners are the biggest
[12113.10s -> 12147.38s]  problem that was pixels that was pixels mate pixels duh that sucked I thought I touched it
[12161.82s -> 12176.42s]  no what about uh n plus I actually didn't play that much n plus I played a lot of meat boy
[12176.42s -> 12184.95s]  and what was that there's a couple of the really big ones the ones where you had to shoot
[12184.95s -> 12190.15s]  people out of cannons and go further and further and further and upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade
[12190.15s -> 12198.89s]  upgrade stuff like uh burrito um what was it get learned to fly was one toss the turtle
[12198.89s -> 12209.72s]  what's the one I'm thinking of though burrito bison that's the one toss the turtle I would love
[12211.61s -> 12219.13s]  a those dominated for a long time then they kind of went away forever I missed those games
[12222.39s -> 12233.34s]  I wish somebody would make a new version of one of those I feel like those would do really really
[12233.34s -> 12245.53s]  well now can you imagine that with a bunch of content and a ton more to do there's been a
[12245.53s -> 12252.49s]  couple of remakes right and kind of re-releases of those but not a brand new one and if it exists
[12252.49s -> 12269.42s]  please tell me so I can obsess over it damn it burrito bison's on the app store yeah I've beaten
[12269.42s -> 12273.42s]  it already though that came out a while ago that came out a long time ago on the app store
[12279.53s -> 12303.69s]  toss the turtle remake what about tank artillery game I remember artillery dude you know what man
[12303.69s -> 12310.87s]  why don't we just play some of those one of these days I would just sit there and play burrito bison
[12310.87s -> 12320.39s]  or learn to fly or toss the turtle all day just sit here and just hang out and play it let's put
[12320.39s -> 12351.24s]  that on the list that sounds fun I have to get this uh you should do it right now uh I I can't
[12351.24s -> 12363.27s]  I actually can't what about I want to be the guy yeah let's revive the kind of old flash uh nights
[12363.27s -> 12375.03s]  that I used to do here DOS nights flash nights they were fun I can't leave until I get the 20
[12375.03s -> 12392.78s]  seconds I can't leave flash is dead but I believe there are certain things that you can still play
[12392.78s -> 12400.46s]  them with I did a absolutely minuscule amount of research but I think there is a way to do it still
[12404.39s -> 12420.47s]  uh yes flashpoint I need to look into it a little bit more there's a couple other old games that I
[12420.47s -> 12430.22s]  really want to try to track down again I'm trying to remember what the context of this particular
[12430.22s -> 12465.61s]  game was let me see if I can figure it out no one adult swim unicorn game that's right
[12465.61s -> 12477.46s]  it was one where you had to like bounce stuff you had to like throw it a certain distance or
[12477.46s -> 12484.71s]  something and it was insanely insanely frame perfect detailed I forget what it was called
[12485.67s -> 12503.85s]  no not angry birds no not not angry birds I almost just beat it and I wasn't even looking
[12503.85s -> 12532.74s]  monkey kickball was that it shit backyard baseball I don't think it was backyard baseball
[12536.57s -> 12543.34s]  I saw it wasn't a wasn't will neff playing that for a while you see he's like he's the
[12543.34s -> 12575.56s]  goat of that game right this is the one right here guaranteed oh I thought I had it that was
[12575.56s -> 12613.83s]  doing so good I gotta get them out of the corner that's death you piece of shit I have to get
[12613.83s -> 12634.66s]  through that oh I can't leave we're gonna miss my appointment stir said hey man where are you our
[12634.66s -> 12650.20s]  appointment was a bit ago yeah but I my uh my stomach hurts I don't feel good I don't feel good
[12650.20s -> 12671.66s]  I can't I can't go take me with you why did you write that I don't there's no context for you to
[12671.66s -> 12694.78s]  write that take me with you yeah stir thinks he can beat this game let's see him do dark world
[12694.78s -> 12728.63s]  like me and I'm doing right now give me the dash have you been in this level for like 15 hours
[12728.63s -> 12739.35s]  yeah I'm I got to 19.2 seconds it was 19.2 no I think it's it's definitely slow
[12740.07s -> 12763.05s]  what is it maybe absorb why is this one what is the right place why is that gold it is not that
[12763.05s -> 12798.81s]  power at all it's slow this is the one right here I'll get it right now that didn't even touch me
[12798.81s -> 12874.17s]  come on no yes short stream Andy yeah I know I know I'm just streaming you can stop now I
[12874.17s -> 12893.14s]  yeah I know I mean I'm already I'm already late to this appointment so hard mode is 10 seconds to
[12893.14s -> 12902.87s]  clear uh yeah I know I just trying to get the 20 20 is the real completion of the level it might
[12902.87s -> 12916.23s]  even be higher on some of them how am I even going to touch the squares in the middle I've just made
[12916.23s -> 12946.09s]  it down here oh oh dear oh dear oh there's no getting out of that that's true get him right at
[12946.09s -> 12968.26s]  the beginning that's right what I do just stay out of the corners and I'll be all right oh he's
[12968.26s -> 13002.52s]  got to move how he's got to move I was close oh my goodness that was so perfect too it just they
[13002.52s -> 13029.19s]  he just spammed it at me keep getting purple guy killed the purple guy hey I'm not in control of
[13029.19s -> 13053.58s]  the purple I already blew it I didn't go in the middle first get the ones in the middle and I'm
[13053.58s -> 13099.75s]  fine no I can't stop playing this dude that void whatever it is pushed it over you saw that that
[13099.75s -> 13121.94s]  was annoying sticking with this formula you should be able to get them all needs to go backwards
[13121.94s -> 13134.70s]  they're gonna shoot it oh come on why am I doing that I'm getting worried about you I'm fine don't
[13134.70s -> 13152.25s]  worry about me hey don't worry about me I didn't go in the middle well these ones are definitely a
[13152.25s -> 13169.91s]  lot more precision based it's a great play gonna work out though I can't move oh I was pushed up
[13169.91s -> 13184.20s]  to the edge of the thing yeah I couldn't move you can't walk into this you can't dash through
[13184.20s -> 13214.39s]  it either oh I thought I had it somebody should make a compilation just um and have it have to
[13214.39s -> 13222.07s]  be no time in the middle of every time that I've gone oh just string them all together I wonder
[13222.07s -> 13237.54s]  what it sounds like be like I sound like a banjo kazooie character probably get out of the
[13237.54s -> 13255.19s]  fucking way oh my god I can't touch it I how am I supposed to touch that there were two that
[13255.19s -> 13270.78s]  were spawned by then it almost took up the whole entire map all right 10 more tries and I'm done
[13270.78s -> 13276.95s]  this one doesn't count it only counts if I clear the middle first okay this now is a real attempt
[13278.28s -> 13290.31s]  10 more real attempts I don't count that one either oh none of these counted I have to make
[13290.31s -> 13301.78s]  one full revolution around here and get to phase two all right this is a real attempt now oh sloppy
[13302.42s -> 13319.88s]  that one doesn't come that is so annoying why is that that keeps killing me and I just shouldn't
[13319.88s -> 13357.72s]  I'm getting just too a hair too close that doesn't count either I've done two I'm in trouble
[13357.72s -> 13380.01s]  I should play Hearthstone instead no it happened again I just I what I don't those things never
[13380.01s -> 13402.39s]  killed me until I gave myself a amount of times I can do this still I I can never touch the ones
[13402.39s -> 13419.69s]  in the middle from here I gotta get the ones in the middle right now yeah they have to get
[13419.69s -> 13438.42s]  him first otherwise it just becomes I don't think becomes possible oh you piece of shit
[13439.06s -> 13470.23s]  that didn't even touch me all right five more that's it no that doesn't count either I'm getting
[13470.23s -> 13483.18s]  sloppy you never told us about the skunk dream oh that's right I I mean I told it in um what
[13483.18s -> 13493.82s]  pre-stream or the discord or something I had a dream that I mean the extent of the whole dream
[13493.82s -> 13498.70s]  it really is not that intriguing it's not wild it's not something that is going to make you go wow
[13498.70s -> 13509.70s]  what a crazy dream I had a dream that they were what I thought were cats in the room like oh yeah
[13509.70s -> 13515.78s]  like there's just cats in here and they were just kind of walking around and hanging out
[13516.60s -> 13524.65s]  like oh yeah of course there's here's here are the cats and it turned out though that they were
[13524.65s -> 13533.11s]  skunks and I looked down and realized that they were skunks and was like pet I had been petting
[13533.11s -> 13540.39s]  these like oh hey like hi like kitty it was a skunk but they were cats in my brain and they
[13540.39s -> 13545.19s]  were really friendly they wasn't like weird it was just yeah I just hanging out with some skunks
[13545.91s -> 13556.52s]  that's the whole dream there was a baby skunk from what I remember and I'm a petting the baby
[13556.52s -> 13561.88s]  skunk's head and is doing that thing it was closing its eyes and leaning its head up
[13562.60s -> 13569.72s]  did you know just barely holding its head up like oh yeah I like that that's it and then I woke up
[13570.36s -> 13578.49s]  what does that mean I have not seen a skunk I have not talked about a skunk I've not heard
[13578.49s -> 13584.06s]  anything about a skunk why did I have a dream that I was hanging out with skunks and we were cool
[13584.62s -> 13594.22s]  it was like oh yeah this is cool they're with friends it means you smell all right 10 more
[13601.67s -> 13609.75s]  I have to pull I gotta pull a plug right now yeah I gotta I have to pull the plug
[13610.31s -> 13623.51s]  I have to I will I'll never leave yeah this is the end I'm uninstalling the game damn it it didn't
[13623.51s -> 13650.66s]  work I can't wait for the toss the turtle stream that's gonna be fun that was it right there I just
[13650.66s -> 13671.05s]  got pushed up when they spam all in one direction at me I can't even it's over just like you
[13671.05s -> 13679.80s]  uninstalled breath of the wild you got me why have I not gone back to breath of the wild when
[13679.80s -> 13705.50s]  I said I would well because I needed to make room oh my god that was it too it's never I'm
[13705.50s -> 13718.98s]  never gonna be able to do this yeah I needed to make room from monster hunter rise and I thought
[13718.98s -> 13724.71s]  I was gonna free up some space by just deleting this fucking game and I really wanted to play
[13724.71s -> 13733.48s]  monster hunter rise and I just I accidentally uninstalled it and now my games are gone all my
[13733.48s -> 13741.48s]  save files are out of here and I was really unhappy about it I was really pissed off about it
[13742.20s -> 13760.73s]  and then I smashed my wii over my knee I had to switch dude what yeah I went into I went into the
[13761.29s -> 13766.41s]  into my closet I got the wii out and I smashed the wii instead of the switch for some reason
[13766.41s -> 13788.20s]  apparently people heard that is weenie yeah I got yeah dude I gotta get pissed off I was
[13788.20s -> 13795.48s]  fucking furious nice I smashed my weenie uh I smashed my weenie really hard I was pissed
[13805.08s -> 13811.82s]  all right I'm done I'm done after this I have 10 minutes to do this that would be four hours on
[13811.82s -> 13846.01s]  stream that's it I have 10 minutes to get this done you can't do it it's pushes you people got
[13846.01s -> 13851.48s]  timed out earlier for saying penis flattening stream yeah but that was completely out of context
[13853.18s -> 13863.72s]  context where's the context you got context if you can't if you just say hey when is the penis
[13863.72s -> 13870.04s]  flattening stream you're gonna you're gonna get timed out but if I had if we had just talked about
[13870.04s -> 13883.50s]  how I dropped a book on my penis then okay now you there's context for you to just discuss you
[13883.50s -> 13918.68s]  just where's the context it's important I never told I didn't tell you guys this but it's it's
[13918.68s -> 13926.07s]  funny enough to tell you no no enough time has passed remember when I went on break I went on
[13926.07s -> 13934.38s]  that break where I was like okay I'm gonna be gone for a few weeks the first day of that break
[13935.02s -> 13947.70s]  first day okay let's go over it very quickly I um it's like all right it's time I'm on my break
[13948.42s -> 13955.48s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna just relax for a little bit and and look it's just so you know sometimes I
[13955.48s -> 13960.20s]  just want to it's time to relax right it doesn't happen all the time doesn't happen every day
[13960.84s -> 13967.40s]  but I want to relax and I'm I'm gonna you know 21 and older in a state where it is legalized
[13968.12s -> 13979.54s]  I um I put took in some marijuana product okay there you go so a little while goes by and it's
[13979.54s -> 13984.50s]  fine and it's this is everything's good just hanging out it's like all right this is cool
[13984.50s -> 13989.94s]  start of this break I feel like I kind of needed it a lot of stuff is going on um stuff that you
[13989.94s -> 13994.66s]  guys don't really know that you probably will very soon but it's very exciting but things we'll talk
[13994.66s -> 13997.38s]  about and one of those things obviously was rambo's show because that's a huge deal and
[13997.38s -> 14011.58s]  it's really cool but I digress I shit my pants I shit my pants and I went up to take care of this
[14015.91s -> 14027.16s]  and in the process of taking care of this I clogged the toilet so I shit my pants
[14027.88s -> 14034.20s]  went to the bathroom I can take care of this this has not happened in a very long time a very long
[14034.20s -> 14044.57s]  time so I clogged the toilet and I realized there's no plunger I don't have one the one that I did
[14044.57s -> 14048.25s]  have I wanted to replace because it's like you know every so often you get rid of a plunger
[14048.81s -> 14052.41s]  you get rid of it because like it's kind of at some point right you need to replace it
[14053.96s -> 14062.26s]  so I couldn't go anywhere right like I'm I'm I'm I'm what am I gonna do so I'm a little bit
[14062.82s -> 14065.78s]  you know I'm a little inebriated I'm obviously not gonna not gonna get in a car
[14066.42s -> 14074.41s]  so I contemplated I was like I think I have to I think I have to call italics and see if he'll go
[14074.41s -> 14090.10s]  buy me a plunger and deliver it to the house it didn't get that far because thank thank god
[14091.00s -> 14113.43s]  thank god it ended up just it went down and I was like oh thank god yeah and imagine that
[14113.43s -> 14121.35s]  conversation that I would have had to have hey man um yeah I uh I shit my pants and then I clogged
[14121.35s -> 14126.15s]  the toilet and I I'm not I'm not gonna drive anywhere but of course it's not happening
[14127.21s -> 14135.45s]  can you you know maybe we'll give you a plunger and come and deliver it and I'll pay you I was
[14135.45s -> 14148.79s]  gonna I was gonna pay you know I was gonna pay whatever it took why are you self-reporting all
[14148.79s -> 14158.94s]  this I don't know I think it's kind of funny don't make a moment out of this why that's just a stupid
[14158.94s -> 14173.18s]  story my embarrassing it's so funny because I ended up you know just kind of I think Holly
[14173.18s -> 14177.18s]  knew something was going on because like obviously you don't want to tell anybody like oh hey by the
[14177.18s -> 14185.98s]  way hey honey I shit my pants and clogged the toilet um I have I don't think I've seen her laugh
[14185.98s -> 14197.45s]  as hard as I did because no no it's both things happened both things happened in the same like
[14197.45s -> 14207.27s]  20 minute period so it's a come on come on you can't do that to me I'll take one of those things
[14207.27s -> 14232.18s]  as enough of an annoyance but both of them happening that's not okay that sucks oh that
[14232.18s -> 14243.38s]  was it how long you been on this level for I I haven't really been paying attention how long did
[14243.38s -> 14255.56s]  you how long did you clog the toilet if it because I didn't guys listen I it's not like I dropped an
[14255.96s -> 14261.18s]  you do you do you any idea what I'm referring to when I say this I think a lot of you might think
[14261.18s -> 14265.58s]  that there's like a cartoon dump in my pants when does that that's not how this plays out
[14266.30s -> 14286.22s]  that's not how that happens it's not like what stop talking I need to explain so people get
[14286.22s -> 14294.90s]  the real picture why was this topic brought up I've been sitting on this topic for like
[14294.90s -> 14302.70s]  four and a half weeks because I thought it was really funny afterwards like first day vacation
[14302.70s -> 14315.69s]  all this they all this happens in a row we don't want you to visualize it you don't have to just
[14316.25s -> 14336.30s]  listen to the sounds listen to my the sounds my voice talking all right this is the one right
[14336.30s -> 14354.89s]  here watch bro this is impossible did you flush your pants no I didn't flush my pants down what
[14354.89s -> 14377.70s]  are you talking about you guys are really overestimating like how how you're thinking
[14377.78s -> 14392.09s]  too deeply into the first part the first part is a oops it's not a whoa oh what the holy shit
[14393.13s -> 14403.43s]  whoa it's I can't even move no it's a oops it's a oops you guys are seriously putting way too much
[14403.43s -> 14426.49s]  into that first part yeah Holly just said you were being really quiet it's just silent why
[14426.49s -> 14430.33s]  yeah and that's abnormal because I'm usually just doing like Thanos impressions walking around the
[14430.33s -> 14451.74s]  house that's abnormal already okay you know when you kind of haven't seen your dog in like a few
[14451.74s -> 14463.82s]  minutes and it's like wait a minute where's the dog what's going on it's like what this I think
[14463.82s -> 14500.44s]  the dog's getting is a dog dog's getting into trouble I think the same with kids yeah stop
[14500.44s -> 14536.81s]  camping the middle you're camping the middle I would have had it oh shit it's been 10 minutes
[14536.81s -> 14560.57s]  come on move it's not fair oh no that's how you know he stopped it I am inevitable shits his pants
[14560.57s -> 14573.98s]  and is quiet now like wait a minute where's the next part of that usually after that you hear
[14573.98s -> 14582.68s]  slow footsteps in there I know what it's like to lose know so deeply that you're right it failed
[14582.68s -> 14612.90s]  a little that follow-up did not happen so where is he all right that's it I'm done I'm done I'm
[14612.90s -> 14620.79s]  done it's too addicting and I've it's challenging and hard and it's fun it's a fun game and I I want
[14620.79s -> 14629.72s]  to beat this level so bad but it's so tricky I'm done I'm done and I'm gonna install it that's it
[14629.72s -> 14632.60s]  all right goodbye that's enough I'll see you later that's enough that's the end of this one
[14633.24s -> 14655.77s]  I'm a new strategy new strategy let's see if it works all right I actually have a new strategy
[14655.77s -> 14661.80s]  let's go I'm leaving the bottom right corner and I'm gonna pull him to the bottom right corner
[14666.52s -> 14670.28s]  actually right now go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go I got it I think I got it
[14673.82s -> 14715.86s]  you can't move you actually can't move there's no escape the dash no you can't dash doesn't go
[14715.86s -> 14726.52s]  through the uh the void or whatever it is what are you doing all right this is the actually the
[14726.52s -> 14754.15s]  last one what the fuck are you I'm done what are you supposed to do I'm done that's it that was
[14754.15s -> 14759.53s]  cool and take a look at how much other hard shit there is to do in this game there's also
[14759.53s -> 14775.32s]  secrets and stuff that's fun I like it I like it a lot oh also I think um the 4k non crusty version
[14775.32s -> 14780.07s]  of the grotto beast commercial I know people have been asking for it looking for it it's
[14780.07s -> 14788.07s]  going to be going up on the grotto beast channel I think in the next little bit tonight you want
[14788.07s -> 14808.04s]  to see it without the crust you have to end on a win no that's a that's a fallacy that's a fallacy
[14808.04s -> 14813.91s]  but I'll see you later uh let's actually raid someone it's been a while I feel like
[14813.91s -> 14817.74s]  I've been streaming really late at night I haven't really had an opportunity to

[15063.40s -> 15072.30s]  that's right I forgot about the music uh okay let me put the music on that's right I don't I
[15072.30s -> 15079.86s]  didn't put the music on what was I thinking ladies and gentlemen welcome to episode one
[15080.42s -> 15089.38s]  of food for thought the podcast where I talk about food and food stuffs sometimes maybe even
[15089.38s -> 15094.42s]  talk about other things that have nothing to do with food but we'll see how it goes on the first
[15094.42s -> 15102.47s]  episode so I don't really have a plan with this I just knew that it was something I wanted to do
[15102.47s -> 15110.87s]  eventually and something I've been thinking about but I think I'll first before we get into anything
[15111.83s -> 15117.19s]  I'll probably should probably list my favorite foods why would you be listening to a food
[15117.19s -> 15123.30s]  podcast before the person tells you what their favorite foods are I mean I I wouldn't listen
[15123.30s -> 15131.86s]  to it either my number one favorite food well I should probably start from my least most favorite
[15131.86s -> 15141.98s]  is that how it would probably go my least most favorite food is grilled chicken it's very versatile
[15142.06s -> 15151.75s]  to be used in a lot of different ways a lot of different casseroles and sandwiches you can put
[15151.75s -> 15159.45s]  it on a plate with some rice and and it'd be great it's just a very versatile piece of equipment
[15160.09s -> 15168.09s]  to use in the kitchen I eat grilled chicken probably every few days it's very easy to keep
[15168.09s -> 15176.55s]  in the fridge it's very easy to keep in the freezer but besides that I think my number nine
[15176.55s -> 15183.37s]  least most favorite food would probably have to be spaghetti spaghetti again also very versatile
[15185.21s -> 15198.34s]  you can put beans sometimes I would put beans on it excuse me oil red sauce white sauce doesn't
[15198.34s -> 15204.76s]  matter pasta is incredibly especially pasta spaghetti meatballs how many meatball fans do
[15204.76s -> 15212.81s]  I have out here I'm sure I have quite a few but I think that my favorite food would probably be
[15212.81s -> 15220.15s]  meatballs number one again how many times have you been at this grocery store you think yourself
[15221.26s -> 15227.53s]  what the heck am I even going to have for dinner tonight and I I don't know I had the answer to
[15227.53s -> 15233.37s]  that question is I don't know but it would usually be meatballs for me if not grilled chicken and
[15233.37s -> 15245.08s]  some bell peppers and asparagus um I think I I think that's probably it for this episode
[15245.80s -> 15251.94s]  I'll check back in with you all um on the next one which is probably going to be this Sunday
[15252.82s -> 15261.56s]  is sunday or saturday I I don't really have anything else to say I just those are my favorite
[15261.56s -> 15271.35s]  top 10 favorite foods and I just um yeah I I this is uh we'll we'll come back next week and
[15271.35s -> 15277.19s]  we'll talk about uh we'll talk about my favorite restaurants there's quite a few so we'll go through
[15277.19s -> 15281.35s]  those too because you really need to know this stuff before we get into anything really important
[15281.35s -> 15290.63s]  but that's it that's episode one this has been uh food for thought with me Jeremy Elbertson
[15291.93s -> 15306.23s]  78 years old today it is 2060 and that's how old I am today well it's not my birthday but I
[15306.23s -> 15317.51s]  would be I am 78 have a great night see you next week all right bye see you
