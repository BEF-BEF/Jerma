[2.17s -> 47.13s]  All right, let's get this on the screen. I played the last Mario Maker. I streamed the last Mario Maker like on launch. What are you on about here? Yeah, we'll go through my images too. Somebody's asking about it. All the screenshots. Okay, get that on here. We'll do this for like an hour or two. Oh, but um, yes, I want to talk about the somebody's saying delicious. I can't speak when things are blowing up my ears. Post the pics on Reddit or Twitter. I
[47.13s -> 101.35s]  we're just gonna do a little showcase. This looks good. See, look, I've like already played this game. We'll do a new one. Maybe you won't hate. Did I hate Mario Maker 1? Did I didn't hate Mario Maker 1? Did I? I did. All right, let's cook. Standard difficulty. Yeah, I like my hands suck. My hands are wicked crampy and shitty. So I have trouble doing like that. I can probably use a controller to though. Couldn't I should plug this in? I'm gonna pull the controller in. Well, look, if Mario Maker
[101.35s -> 154.75s]  If I hate Mario Maker 2, then who cares? We can just load up Cokeserve item shop tomorrow or whatever. No rush. But I mean, I am in a rush to find a USB cable that goes to this fucking USB cable that goes to this. Where are all of my things? Where are my things? Use gamepad. No, it's a free Xbox one. There it is.
[156.25s -> 191.50s]  All right, here we go. This feels pretty good on my hands here. Let's cook. Standard difficulty. So this game is about being quick and serving customers very fast. This is your main restaurant serving area doesn't look like the best. But hey, you'll fix it up in no time. You can press the menu button to pause the game at any time during the day. To the left is your prep stations. You'll start with four, but will earn more as you gain stars for your restaurant. You can take orders and serve food from here. Let's give it a try. Highlight prep station one by pressing up on the D pad and
[191.50s -> 231.46s]  press a. This is a customer ticket. He wants a corndog. This game gave me anxiety about an old job like fast food, preparing food quickly. Prep station one is highlighted press right button to prep the food on the right side of the screen. So we got to do we just got to do ketchup and mustard, right? He looks like he wants a corndog cursor on screen. I'm leaving it. You now have the corndog order in front of you. The right menu shows which keys to press for what ingredients and the bottom ticket is how the customer wants the food made.
[231.46s -> 270.79s]  Once you've done with an order press the LB to serve it to the customer. Just ketchup please. That's mustard. How do I remove that? I thought of how do I remove that? I have to remove that. Is there a way I can take that off? Well, I fucked up your order. Give me three stars on Yelp. Dick. Okay, right bumper. Ketchup and mustard please. More complex food that requires you to cook before serving and that has you access more ingredients. Alright, this is a pizza. The nachos have an ingredient that needs to be cooked before preparing the
[270.79s -> 305.38s]  food. Highlight prep station one RB. Okay, so I want so it's ground meat. Complete the order on the ticket then press LB to throw the order back to the left side of the screen to start cooking it. Okay, to cook it. Ground meat is cooking. You'll need to wait a few seconds for the meat to grill at the right temperature before serving. Once the order turns blue, it's ready to be prepped. Select the order too soon or too late and your customer will have raw or burned meat and will likely have a bad rating. The nachos are ready for additional ingredients. Highlight prep
[305.38s -> 344.01s]  station one and here we go. So this person's you need to you will need to hold you need to press and hold LT to access the second page of ingredients. Release the trigger to go back to the original page of ingredients if needed. Be sure to recognize that the left column of ingredients call for the left stick to be flicked in a direction and the right column uses the right stick. What do you want? Queso guacamole. Queso guacamole. Beans, rice, and ground meat. Beans, rice,
[344.01s -> 382.22s]  and ground beef. I'm telling you I can't I can't play this game. I have to say everything. Beans, beans, onion. Okay great work you just completed a more advanced order. You can always practice more individual foods in the view by food menu. Press A. Alright here we go. There are two types of orders that you'll find in cook serve delicious. When an order is highlighted blue after cooking it will require additional prep. Yep when an order is yellow it requires an
[382.22s -> 416.25s]  no more prep and is ready to be served to the customer. Simply select to serve it immediately. Press A. You can only prepare one order at a time however you can serve yellow cooked orders to customers immediately even when preparing a different order. Simply highlight the order and press right bumper to serve at any time. Press A to continue. Customers won't wait around forever and have their food to order taken. You'll notice that this food is slowly disappearing from the screen. If it goes away completely the customer will leave angrily and will cause bad buzz for your restaurant. There are ways of extending customer patience with the equipment menu which will be unlocked later in the I have to I can't
[416.25s -> 452.47s]  like put on my fake television voice because it's just too hard of a game. Sorry guys that's just the way it is. Customers won't wait around forever yet. Okay there are ways of extending customer patience via the equipment menu which will be unlocked later in the I have to. There are also chores to contend with but that's enough tutorials for now. You can always select practice chores in the tutorial menu and try out all the chores you need to complete daily. Let's go. That you just learned the basics. Here we go open the restaurant. Here we go. I'm not moving it. I was about to move it. Yeah I'll move it. Alright welcome welcome welcome. This is your main menu.
[452.47s -> 493.13s]  Managing menu. For me you can control your food menu. Buy new items and a whole lot more. You'll work from 9 to 10 p.m. Wait 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Isn't that too long? Then between each day you'll come back to this menu to plan out your business. First when you buy some food to put on your menu you have a starting budget that should allow you to purchase three to five foods out of the initial 20 that's offered. You can do that via the view by foods menu. Speaking of an amount of things I did want to tell you so in the beginning of the stream I talked about it a little bit but I wanted to give just another reiteration
[493.13s -> 532.49s]  of the next couple months. So there is going to be on this stream somewhere in before September the carnival stream. There's going to be a carnival on this stream. There's going to be a bunch of midway games that you guys are going to play. It's not just going to be a dunk tank. It's going to be a fucking monumental event with tons of games. So the reason why I now have to dial I just I have to dial streams back a little bit. So four days a week is typically what I would typically do. It's probably going to
[532.49s -> 571.13s]  be dialed back to like three. I want to make sure I like said that a few times. Then this is like as of like next week. I don't want to give like any spoilers. I don't want to give any more information but there's going to be a lot of shit to do. So hopefully it's fun but I have the process has started of a company that's now involved that is going to I may have to do traveling back and forth from this facility a few times. So I will make sure you guys are going to know exactly when this is happening. You're going to see
[571.13s -> 620.39s]  probably testing in the chat too. There's no way that you will miss this if you want to see it because of the next three to five weeks I'm going to be talking about it all the time. SpaceX. No. Do we get prizes? You're just going to have to wait. You have to wait and see. But this is not just going to be a dunk tank stream. Welcome to the carnival. That's all I'm going to say. I'd rather it be like a fun surprise. You'll know the date but that's pretty much where I want to leave it. It's going to be a sub only stream. Why the hell would I do that?
[620.39s -> 690.12s]  But there's still going to be a dunk tank. Absolutely. So just to give you an indication. It's a robotics team. So every one of these carnival games is going to be controlled by you guys. This is not just like hey walk around like a fake carnival. You guys control all the games. That's the point. There is an entire robotics team that is on board with this and it's going to be fucking a ton of fun. That's it. That's the end of all the information that I'm going to give you. It's going to happen before
[690.12s -> 751.54s]  September. Oh fucking need to read this. Or like September-ish. I don't really have like an exact date yet but I will have that information over the next couple of weeks. I will be promoting the shit out of this so don't worry about...wait what? More details. September 2030? No. September 2019. I wish I could like talk about more of this and it's something that I'm like so obsessed with this right now. But I want it at least to be like surprising for a lot of the things that we're doing.
[751.54s -> 796.26s]  But anyways, that's why I have to start to cut streams over the next like two months. I am fucking stoked. Anyways, you'll notice a few foods require a piece of equipment. Yeah I need equipment to do so. I remember this stuff. You have to buy it. There's boosters and tractors. These are elements of foods that can help or hurt your business by bringing in more customers during the day or run them off entirely, right? If you have dirty trash everywhere. Yeah. Buzz is vital in keeping customers. The higher you buzz the faster customers
[796.26s -> 838.10s]  will come through the door during the day. Perfect orders gain buzz for the next work day. Average orders add no buzz and bad orders subtract from your buzz. That's true. Gotta add the foods to the active menu. You can do up to six foods a day. Plan on your menu each day to balance out which foods gain the most buzz. I'm ready. So let's do...what's the menu we got right now? Literally nothing. All right I want um pretzel. Yeah I want pretzel. Beer. Pretzels. Beer.
[838.10s -> 892.47s]  And um fish. No that would a terrible restaurant. Pretzels. Beer. And baked potatoes. And steak. Okay that sounds good. So let's do pretzels. Beer. Baked potato. And steak. That's a carb heavy menu. What about equipment? Are we good? Grill station. Deep fryer. I don't think I need this. Oh I did. I want the tip station. All right I'm ready. Begin. Steak. One seasoning.
[892.47s -> 937.72s]  Once seasoned. Twice juicy. And one serving is citrus. Season uh juicy and citrus. And then oh fuck cook it. Baked potato is uh sour cream bacon and onions. Sour cream bacon and onion. Serve it. That wasn't good? What was wrong with it? What was wrong with that? I don't understand. Cheese and sour cream. Cheese and sour cream. Why do they not like this? Oh fuck the steak. The steak. Steak. Okay hold. Pour beer. Toilet.
[937.72s -> 1007.59s]  What do you want from the toilet? Did I always wash my hands in the toilet? Nothing on it. Here. Salt and butter please. Rush hour. Sanitize. Come on. Once seasoned. Twice juicy. And citrus. These controls actually are not very good. Cheese, sour cream, butter. Okay. Dude it's the. It's the. I don't like this. I'm going back to the keyboard. No I don't like this. This is not good. It's like.
[1007.59s -> 1082.06s]  You can't use the left analog to move up and down. No no no no no no no no. Awful. No. Give me the keyboard. Do it. Cheese, sour cream, butter. I just heard that like raw. Yeah the the the bumper is. I can't do it. Hitting up and down on the analog. You have to do up and down on the D pad. No. It's fucking with my head. Left bumper to serve. Why shouldn't it be right bumper? If it's right bumper to open the menu why isn't it right bumper to serve the food?
[1082.06s -> 1108.15s]  Season the toilet. Sour cream and cheese please. Wait doesn't it doesn't need to cook first? Yeah hold on. It's like needs to steam. Cook serve delicious with the controller. You poor man. I know I know. I just I didn't know. I didn't know.
[1118.97s -> 1134.97s]  Trees, potatoes. Sour cream and onion. Cinnamon please. That's. I gotta get out of the controller.
[1154.66s -> 1194.55s]  Nothing. What do I have to do? Pretty good. Sour cream and onion. Whoa what was wrong with the steaks?
[1195.19s -> 1219.24s]  What was wrong with the steaks? Fuck this place. What was wrong with the steaks? What was wrong with the steaks?
[1220.42s -> 1224.79s]  God. I know this is a typing game. I'm a moron for wanting to use the controller.
[1225.59s -> 1231.35s]  I know this is a typing game and I'm using a controller. Look. It wasn't part of the plan tonight.
[1242.09s -> 1256.04s]  Yeah it's a typing game. This is a long day. If only I. Yeah unplug the controller.
[1258.33s -> 1261.54s]  I just did. That didn't do anything. It's still on the controller setting.
[1262.41s -> 1274.06s]  You have to do it in the menu. Come on come on come on. Season three times
[1274.86s -> 1292.39s]  and one juice. No. Whatever. Cheese and sour cream. Derma's IQ is equal to the temperature of
[1292.39s -> 1295.35s]  the steaks. The raw ass steaks that he's serving. Well that's funny because the
[1295.35s -> 1299.91s]  internal temperature of a raw steak is usually like 112. So that's pretty good actually. Thanks
[1299.91s -> 1317.19s]  for the compliment. Like 120. All right I need to change this because hold on.
[1319.50s -> 1326.50s]  Save and quit. I'm doing the keyboard. No not quit the whole game. Just like hit the menu.

[1364.78s -> 1375.22s]  Corn dogs are easy. I need a drink. I need drinks. Always remain fresh on the active menu.
[1375.22s -> 1379.91s]  It's not going to decline in popularity. Customers don't ever tip with this.
[1382.78s -> 1387.42s]  Minus five buzz. Trashy food. Then it can be taken to go. All right. What about uh
[1387.42s -> 1396.90s]  uh a soup? This is making me hungry and I'm not even playing. I mean I am playing. How about a

[1853.62s -> 1858.62s]  on but for instance french fries ketchup is better on french fries then
[1858.62s -> 1863.66s]  mustard is on french fries you don't put you don't do that and if you do
[1863.66s -> 1877.30s]  then what in the what are you doing ketchup is way more unhealthy how is
[1877.30s -> 1882.68s]  ketchup more unhealthy than mustard they're both fucking puke condiments

[1983.87s -> 1991.31s]  know it for some reason Mayo has this weird incredibly polarized opinion that a
[1991.31s -> 1997.51s]  lot of people have you either think mayonnaise is disgusting unedible garbage
[1997.51s -> 2012.88s]  or you like it there's no in between Mayo is salty jello no it's not jello
[2012.88s -> 2016.72s]  sucks I just had to eat a shitload of jello and it's just it's not even
[2016.72s -> 2020.74s]  close if I was allowed to eat mayonnaise out of the jar I probably
[2020.74s -> 2028.26s]  would have if I could have that would be better than eating a jello season three
[2028.26s -> 2047.41s]  times and then no one juice your jello sucks it's horrible guys on jello is
[2047.41s -> 2050.33s]  seriously late somebody I mean this is gonna be gross and I apologize to
[2050.33s -> 2054.49s]  anybody that doesn't like to hear gross things but jello is somebody
[2054.49s -> 2059.33s]  spitting a cold loogie down your throat disgusting I don't want it I
[2059.33s -> 2068.22s]  never want it again season one two three
[2068.26s -> 2082.20s]  gonna see some once and then two juicy one and then you got it I just saw the

[2112.46s -> 2126.18s]  fine jello gross do I need to pause the game to talk about this the
[2126.18s -> 2130.18s]  stuff that you dump from the box and add hot water to and stuff it in your
[2130.18s -> 2135.84s]  fridge for two hours is not the same as the jam that you buy like preserves I

[2214.01s -> 2217.97s]  jello are practically the same thing with jello being a brand name sold in

[7988.02s -> 7992.78s]  a question if you were sitting let's just say you're I don't know yeah I
[7992.78s -> 8038.99s]  are a restaurant right hold on hold that thought so you sit at a
[8038.99s -> 8045.06s]  restaurant and you grab your pants you just touch your other the leg of
[8045.06s -> 8058.30s]  your pants the fabric do you get up and wash your hands yes so if you
[8058.30s -> 8061.48s]  put your hands to your sides and touch your pants you're gonna go wash
[8061.48s -> 8098.51s]  your hands what how often do you guys wash your hands every few minutes no I
[8098.51s -> 8113.84s]  wash my hands every time before eating you touch if I touch my pants I'm gonna
[8113.84s -> 8121.29s]  wash my hands so when you go to the movie and you get a big tub of
[8121.29s -> 8125.64s]  popcorn and you bring the big tub of popcorn and you sit down at the movie
[8125.64s -> 8129.48s]  news and you're like touching the seat and you have your hands on your
[8129.48s -> 8131.28s]  sides and you have your hands on your face and you're eating the
[8131.28s -> 8139.36s]  popcorn when I go and pee we've both done the same thing we've both done the
[8139.36s -> 8155.57s]  same exact process do you wash your hands when you are eating the popcorn
[8155.57s -> 8161.29s]  while you watch the Infinity War do you get up every five minutes to wash
[8161.29s -> 8169.52s]  your hands so when you like I gotta like scratch my leg for a second I
[8169.52s -> 8176.79s]  gotta wash my hands do I not flush I use my I put my foot up and I like
[8176.79s -> 8181.69s]  I put I like and what do you mean do I not flush every single one of
[8181.69s -> 8184.85s]  these urinals is automatic flushing what are you talking about
[8186.17s -> 8197.22s]  have you been to a urinal in the last 10 years that wasn't an auto flush if you
[8197.22s -> 8202.22s]  stand five feet away from that urinal and pee into it and it auto flushes you
[8202.22s -> 8204.90s]  didn't and you didn't touch anything what's the problem what's going on
[8204.90s -> 8209.66s]  there just because you entered the bathroom do you get germs on your
[8209.66s -> 8222.76s]  hands by entering the bathroom no you don't touch anything if you just if
[8222.76s -> 8225.44s]  you just pull your pants and underwear down down to your leg your
[8225.44s -> 8229.04s]  ankles and you pee five feet away into the urinal you didn't touch
[8229.04s -> 8254.69s]  anything what's what's the problem you can't be five feet away without aiming
[8254.69s -> 8275.71s]  body training a toddler what do you but what about what but what if it's one of
[8275.71s -> 8278.87s]  those urinals that's really goes all the way from the wall down to the
[8278.87s -> 8297.58s]  ground this is there an issue you mean a ditch no I'm talking about like
[8297.58s -> 8304.25s]  the wall to ground urinals they're huge what about the splatter are you
[8304.25s -> 8315.15s]  holding your hands down to catch the splashes how far away I've been I how
[8315.15s -> 8321.08s]  far away do I usually go in the urinal I usually go really close like I make
[8321.08s -> 8327.00s]  it so my chest is is pressed up against the urinal because I don't I
[8327.00s -> 8330.68s]  don't want people you know my privacy I press my body into the
[8330.68s -> 8343.01s]  urinal like press it so my chest is touching the the ceramic and then I
[8343.01s -> 8366.06s]  just I'm done with this save and quit imagine seeing some guy like press his
[8366.06s -> 8376.59s]  body into the urinal you'd be like something's wrong here alright that's
[8376.59s -> 8386.53s]  it but anyways I am extraordinarily excited I can't wait I'm gonna be I can
[8386.53s -> 8388.93s]  promise you guys this I'm gonna be I'm gonna be working my ass off on this
[8388.93s -> 8395.14s]  stream so hopefully it's gonna be worth what is hope maybe like a month
[8395.14s -> 8404.54s]  or two wait for this somewhere into September but yeah it's I'm hoping it's
[8404.54s -> 8408.06s]  gonna be a shitload of fun the ideas that were thrown around and the stuff
[8408.06s -> 8413.37s]  that has going on stay tuned because there's gonna be a lot more to talk
[8413.37s -> 8417.56s]  about and yes we'll go over the space pictures we'll do that right now I
[8417.56s -> 8420.32s]  want to give myself some time to do it and the bits and everything I
[8420.32s -> 8426.87s]  took a lot of pictures huh let's see is this the one yeah it's all in the
[8426.87s -> 8437.40s]  same spot right let's go to the beginning I wasn't the beginning one
[8437.56s -> 8453.42s]  all right let's get these on just pull up the window here Microsoft photos I
[8453.42s -> 8459.12s]  don't actually think I have to I think I have to cap the whole desktop
[8459.12s -> 8467.60s]  unfortunately yeah can I full screen there is a full screen would you look
[8467.60s -> 8480.65s]  at that that's pretty cool all right here come the pictures don't be
[8480.65s -> 8488.74s]  alarmed so this is picture number one this was the first I think it's an
[8488.74s -> 8506.66s]  accident that's an accident I guess when this was like the cool globe I got a
[8506.66s -> 8516.03s]  lot better because these aren't very good decent structure decent placement
[8516.03s -> 8520.36s]  I think I was going for like put two eyes here and it makes like a cool
[8520.36s -> 8525.43s]  like Grover character like that in the distance that's not a bad
[8525.43s -> 8538.50s]  background a lot of these aren't bad backgrounds not very good decent I
[8538.50s -> 8548.18s]  don't know I'm getting a weird 80s vibe from this one I'm not sure why
[8548.18s -> 8555.02s]  oh there we go now I'm getting now the 80s filters off now this is just a
[8555.02s -> 8565.81s]  planet I really do like that have the planet taking up like half of the
[8565.81s -> 8586.61s]  picture on the right side that's a keeper I think for sure I would imagine
[8586.61s -> 8590.33s]  this is probably what it would feel like and what you would see if you
[8590.33s -> 8596.02s]  got hit in the head with a wrench not very I don't know if it's very
[8596.02s -> 8606.58s]  good a little too bright I think it needs to be dropped a little bit not
[8606.58s -> 8611.89s]  bad it's a messy right here and a little too much too much luminosity going on
[8611.89s -> 8620.11s]  now this is good this is we're talking the first quarter of a second of the
[8620.11s -> 8633.05s]  Universal Studios intro not bad could be a freeze frame I like this one
[8633.05s -> 8642.79s]  this is the ice rock floating in the distance here I think I get another
[8642.79s -> 8657.30s]  one here yeah I framed it up or or insect egg under the microscope or
[8657.34s -> 8665.01s]  single-celled organism under the microscope not bad I think I get a
[8665.01s -> 8674.69s]  little bit better of a picture here doesn't make me hungry I don't know why
[8674.69s -> 8679.31s]  these are making me hungry this is like nougat it's nougat I don't know why
[8679.31s -> 8682.71s]  that's nougat to me and that's making me hungry delete that one not
[8682.71s -> 8688.52s]  even okay I just got hurt what happened here oh because of that yeah this is
[8688.52s -> 8709.83s]  pretty basic this could be a screenshot from Kenshi again I drop
[8709.83s -> 8713.11s]  kicked you in the head and this is the last thing you saw before you blacked
[8713.11s -> 8729.19s]  out yeah or finger on lens this is 3d moviemaker in fact that is I think the
[8729.19s -> 8739.80s]  exact image from 3d movie maker it's the same thing I like this one
[8739.80s -> 8745.00s]  ominous almost feels like it's moving doesn't it feel like it's
[8745.00s -> 8766.60s]  moving it's not but it's kind of wiggling around for me should have
[8766.60s -> 8776.87s]  probably tilted a little bit this this this picture is kind of cool I like
[8776.87s -> 8788.27s]  this nebula Dutch angle this is not the one this is not the one it looks
[8788.27s -> 8802.34s]  great but it's the next one no no it is that one it is this one is the
[8802.34s -> 8813.91s]  volcano crab 2020 hindsight I wish I dropped the HDR a little bit because
[8813.91s -> 8827.94s]  this is awesome yeah should have dropped the HDR a little bit although
[8827.94s -> 8832.78s]  this would be very very good on the you know when you scroll through on
[8832.78s -> 8836.86s]  Twitter and you see the speaker's advertisement for like a cool headset
[8836.86s -> 8844.76s]  like this is like the latest gamer headset it is like a is a like a
[8844.76s -> 8851.79s]  picture of like your favorite streamer like over here it's like some text up
[8851.79s -> 8859.86s]  here down here this is like the gamer headset image I don't know that is
[8859.86s -> 8871.46s]  this just kind of hurts to look at even worse this you know this reminds
[8871.46s -> 8875.65s]  it this reminds me of when you have disposable cameras two people have
[8875.65s -> 8878.89s]  them and you think it's a funny joke to put the flashes right up
[8878.89s -> 8882.67s]  against each other and get them right next to each other and take a picture of
[8882.67s -> 8897.23s]  each other's cameras what a waste of film I was trying to get I was trying
[8897.23s -> 8903.62s]  I think the next one is better no no it was this one there was a weird fade
[8903.62s -> 8913.00s]  in when it showed a lot of cool stars but I didn't really get it pretty
[8913.00s -> 8931.00s]  interesting cube yeah there's the black hole not sure what this is this
[8931.00s -> 8936.23s]  would be great without this although it is kind of weird seeing what I'm
[8936.23s -> 8954.44s]  not sure what that is I mean I feel like moving I like this one this one's
[8954.44s -> 8965.90s]  cool it's almost like a slinky and then the mirror inside and that's it that is
[8965.90s -> 8984.21s]  there's all the photos I like a little firework down here oh it was
[8984.21s -> 8987.81s]  Florida oh you're right six six and a half hours ago I had a third thing I
[8987.81s -> 8992.21s]  wanted to talk about and yes that was the third thing it was the
[8992.21s -> 8998.16s]  twitch controls robots at the carnival stream and that I'm gonna be
[8998.16s -> 9005.42s]  dialing back streams it was the green screen encore night being Saturday get
[9005.42s -> 9012.60s]  your submission in you need to use the Google form if something can be
[9012.60s -> 9018.84s]  somebody link that that Google form get your submission in by tomorrow night we
[9018.84s -> 9022.96s]  cannot have submissions be sent in like two hours before the stream an hour
[9022.96s -> 9028.85s]  before the stream is just you know it's not gonna happen actually do I
[9028.85s -> 9039.28s]  still have I think I have the link right here the form is on the
[9039.28s -> 9041.68s]  discord and the subreddit yeah but I just want to make sure it's there
[9041.68s -> 9053.77s]  there it is if you have something you'd like to submit please do this is not a
[9053.77s -> 9058.29s]  contest by the way it's not a contest there are no prizes it's just something
[9058.29s -> 9065.11s]  fun for us to do because the first one was so interesting so if your
[9065.11s -> 9069.79s]  submission does not get chosen it doesn't mean that it wasn't any good
[9069.79s -> 9076.21s]  this is not a contest so please don't think that is but the third thing
[9076.21s -> 9081.32s]  was blurred out and blurred I was making he's almost done with his first pass
[9081.32s -> 9085.28s]  of some of the new stuff coming to the channel he's working on he just showed
[9085.28s -> 9092.83s]  me yesterday the new wind down screen and it looks great there's a lot of
[9092.83s -> 9099.37s]  cool things on that wind down screen and a bunch of new music as well so
[9099.37s -> 9105.36s]  that's coming pretty soon you guys will probably get a kick out of it
[9105.36s -> 9119.48s]  and after this first pass of the new wind down screens and animations and the
[9119.48s -> 9126.44s]  music he's gonna be doing cheer motes and a bunch of new emotes and a bunch
[9126.44s -> 9131.80s]  of new sub badges but obviously the animations take the longest because of
[9131.80s -> 9140.82s]  their animations so should be fun but with that I'll see tomorrow we're
[9140.82s -> 9147.55s]  gonna get through the bits we're gonna go through them shouldn't take
[9147.55s -> 9156.66s]  very long post the space photo somewhere online I'll just I could
[9156.66s -> 9161.56s]  probably just throw them in the discord I can just like dump them into
[9161.56s -> 9170.72s]  like the discord or something that probably makes sense right but let's go
[9170.72s -> 9175.80s]  back to a few hours ago more than that Mario maker 2 tomorrow and
[9175.80s -> 9186.75s]  internet sucked tonight by the way yeah 30,000 drop frames unfortunately I
[9186.75s -> 9191.70s]  hope this shit just can finally be over with I actually did get a
[9191.70s -> 9196.86s]  message from Cox that said that they were doing I think because of all the
[9196.86s -> 9201.57s]  complaints and all the problems and they have real problems too they're
[9201.57s -> 9207.41s]  doing I think they're gonna do like a second network upgrade to this node I
[9207.41s -> 9211.84s]  think they're because they're gonna like shut us off for a while and I
[9211.84s -> 9215.87s]  think they're gonna do like a infrastructure upgrade so I think we
[9215.87s -> 9226.21s]  may have complained to a point where like have to do something about it so
[9226.21s -> 9235.09s]  we'll see we will see but anyways we're gonna go back to earlier this

[9436.00s -> 9439.12s]  fifty cents a German I read an interesting take from a guy who was
[9439.12s -> 9441.86s]  saying that we're able to stare at the Sun for short periods with no
[9441.86s -> 9448.10s]  long-term damage and that doing so alleviates depression regulates penile
[9448.10s -> 9453.42s]  health and helps adjust your sleep cycle I don't think any of those are true
[9453.42s -> 9471.34s]  and they say I am NOT a doctor I never could have guessed thank you
[9471.34s -> 9473.66s]  Freudian weapon for the 250 this seems like a really good game for
[9473.66s -> 9478.90s]  getting computer wallpapers LUL I have at least two I know one of them
[9478.90s -> 9486.50s]  I've taken penile health for pissing at five feet honey chain

[9502.92s -> 9508.88s]  now have a terrible pain in my chest and I have disrupted everyone
[9508.88s -> 9516.81s]  within a 50-yard radius well hopefully enjoyed it hopefully you
[9516.81s -> 9520.25s]  didn't disrupt hopefully the people in the 50-yard radius were not like
[9520.25s -> 9533.52s]  hopefully you don't get a library or a classical music concert or a children's
[9533.52s -> 9548.16s]  chorus but thank you it's always it's always a blast it's always fun no
[9548.16s -> 9562.65s]  matter what we're doing thank you I hope they were in a library thank you

[9593.13s -> 9606.94s]  made me cry please correct me if I'm saying your name wrong but here is
[9606.94s -> 9617.16s]  here is some art I'll put it on the screen and something interesting about
[9617.16s -> 9621.80s]  this I don't want to give away anything but something very
[9621.80s -> 9627.08s]  interesting on the screen something interesting on the screen will be there
[9627.08s -> 9637.15s]  in a second I'm not gonna tell you I'm not gonna tell you when you'll maybe
[9637.15s -> 9643.26s]  see those but there is a fairly big stream coming up for you know might
[9643.26s -> 9661.06s]  see them very big stream that I'm doing then they might show up I'm not
[9661.06s -> 9672.89s]  wearing a Star Wars shirt today though that's the thing hey well what's
[9672.89s -> 9684.88s]  the total by the way let me see what do we got it doesn't work the bots
[9684.88s -> 9691.26s]  broken it was up I know it was explain the socks you don't have to worry about
[9691.26s -> 9699.26s]  it I was at like minus 600 or something in the first hour of the
[9699.26s -> 9703.37s]  stream two hours of the stream and then people started to jump on that
[9703.37s -> 9707.25s]  like bandwagon of always do everything's let's do everything minus
[9707.25s -> 9720.32s]  two and get about like a thousand but I was able to comedically rise up it
[9720.32s -> 9737.75s]  was all the kid humor yeah I've you know what I really probably should this is an
[9737.75s -> 9740.19s]  interesting idea and it's not something I have any plans for
[9740.19s -> 9746.70s]  immediately but I should probably just like have an extension get made you
[9746.70s -> 9753.54s]  know saying that has become such a staple of this whole community but
[9753.54s -> 9756.22s]  like I probably should just have an extension at this point that's like
[9756.22s -> 9759.94s]  an actual it's extension you can click on so it wouldn't be like in
[9759.94s -> 9771.33s]  the chat I don't know that sounds like a fun idea maybe just need at
[9771.33s -> 9781.24s]  least to try it the stream turns off when it reaches minus a hundred but I
[9781.24s -> 9790.35s]  triggered I mean yeah the stream turns I kind of like the idea of having an
[9790.35s -> 9794.49s]  extension built where if I'm not if there's if the stream is not at a
[9794.49s -> 9802.26s]  level of like good comedy then it the stream turns off that's actually kind
[9802.26s -> 9818.11s]  of funny and what happens at plus a hundred I don't know you add like 30
[9818.11s -> 9823.14s]  minutes to the stream I don't know at minus a yeah at minus a thousand it
[9823.14s -> 9829.75s]  blares an air horn in my ears it gives you shit minus 200 you get like
[9829.75s -> 9842.66s]  shocked that would be so fucked up I didn't realize those scores were
[9842.66s -> 9848.18s]  actually counted there they haven't been that's a very recent thing but
[9848.18s -> 9857.56s]  thank you for the artwork it's fucking great really appreciate it and thanks
[9857.56s -> 9864.01s]  for the 250 as well you would just die in the stream no I did pretty well

[10319.69s -> 10325.41s]  family that because where we are situated in the country now it's gonna
[10325.41s -> 10329.13s]  be very hard for me to ever see them so it was good that we got to all be in
[10329.13s -> 10334.93s]  a centralized location for four or five days and then the other few days I
[10334.93s -> 10344.79s]  was spent doing work on the robot carnival then that's gonna continue to
[10344.79s -> 10348.73s]  happen that's pretty much every week here at least a couple days a
[10348.73s -> 10352.21s]  week two or three days a week I'm gonna be just completely 100% dedicated

[10372.31s -> 10374.83s]  sorry I don't remember if I already asked this but you ever considered
[10374.83s -> 10383.14s]  trying a PC building simulator I yeah I considered it I did but I feel like I
[10383.14s -> 10387.82s]  did the PC building simulator like fuckface stream and I think I don't
[10387.82s -> 10398.96s]  think I could do like a regular like PC building simulator game because it
[10399.00s -> 10404.48s]  would be be Matt I would be actually just putting parts of the PC I wouldn't
[10404.48s -> 10413.18s]  be able to do what I would want to do in that season the motherboard he
[10413.18s -> 10423.79s]  modded it he can't go back it's true but probably not not on the cards here
[10423.79s -> 10430.25s]  spoons for self-defense thanks to the $15 I say terrible what superpower
[10430.25s -> 10433.49s]  would you rather have becoming indestructible while T posing or
[10433.49s -> 10438.21s]  vomits vomit sentient bees you can control with your brain that one I
[10442.19s -> 10451.20s]  would just make them just do everything for me but look look
[10451.20s -> 10456.92s]  indestructible while T posing is fine but what are you gonna do you what do
[10456.92s -> 10463.04s]  you do with that power you just T pose and just like like fall on your back
[10463.04s -> 10466.88s]  you just like T pose and say run me over with your car and like make
[10466.88s -> 10472.04s]  money at bars or something I don't get it I bet you I could like
[10472.04s -> 10476.16s]  withstand you running me over with your car I'll take that 50 bucks what
[10476.16s -> 10482.99s]  do you do with that having sentient bees that you can control with your
[10482.99s -> 10491.93s]  brain extends your arms to an infinite length can you imagine an army a swarm
[10491.93s -> 10505.71s]  of bees that can go get you a soda out of the fridge that's pretty important
[10505.71s -> 10513.40s]  they could carry you up to bed you could just like lie back down in your
[10513.40s -> 10517.72s]  bee made bee chair and they would just fly you up and lie you into bed
[10517.72s -> 10527.81s]  and you'd get the freshest honey in the world and sell it you'd make
[10527.81s -> 10530.61s]  more money than just being the guy that can take a shovel to the head
[10530.61s -> 10542.16s]  and not die out like in the alleyway he didn't say the amount of bees it could
[10542.16s -> 10550.53s]  be one bee well I mean we don't have that clarification right now I'm
[10550.53s -> 10553.05s]  assuming there's gonna be at least two to three hundred that come out of my
[10553.05s -> 10561.80s]  mouth be armor no I wouldn't want to harm these bees I'd want to take care
[10561.80s -> 10581.48s]  of them no I don't want to be the superpower thing you T pose and are
[10581.48s -> 10584.24s]  indestructible all of a sudden you end up in like a government facility
[10584.24s -> 10588.00s]  where they're like you're gonna have to permanently be T posed otherwise they're
[10588.00s -> 10597.20s]  gonna get you do I have to you have to be standing still while T pose you
[10597.20s -> 10609.48s]  just become a statue wouldn't they do the same thing with bees though no
[10609.48s -> 10613.76s]  because they're how would they're not gonna know that I would just be the
[10613.76s -> 10621.06s]  weirdo that has bees everywhere T posing and being indestructible is not
[10621.06s -> 10625.30s]  the same thing as you have bees surrounding you all over the place you
[10625.30s -> 10629.71s]  have a lot of bees here if anyone came knocking on the door they would
[10629.71s -> 10635.60s]  be like a Toy Story level Andes Cummins scenario it'd be like everybody like
[10635.60s -> 10639.14s]  bang I would think about it move out and so half of them would go into like
[10639.14s -> 10643.54s]  the forest and a thousand of them would go under the bed like 200 would
[10643.54s -> 10646.70s]  fucking just go into like into like the fucking refrigerator or something
[10646.70s -> 10650.22s]  for like five minutes a thousand of them would go like pollinate some
[10650.22s -> 10653.34s]  flowers would go no no we would have a whole plant and they would just be
[10653.34s -> 10669.46s]  bees it would just be bees back into your mouth sir why is your bed
