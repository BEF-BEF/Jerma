[1.72s -> 10.81s]  Hey everybody. We're gonna try a test. We're gonna try to do it again. Who knows if this
[10.81s -> 13.93s]  is gonna be functional or not, but I am, you know, I'm willing to give it a try.
[16.02s -> 25.19s]  All you can do is try. You guys having a good day? What is today? I've lost all track of time
[25.19s -> 37.53s]  has been deleted. What is today? Thursday, November 1st. He's, he's, there he is. He's
[38.33s -> 48.50s]  Well, it never really went anywhere, but we've, we've had some solid green
[49.22s -> 56.90s]  over the last 24 hours. So I figured I would try because we've been dealing with, obviously
[56.90s -> 63.54s]  Cox has been trying to get infrastructurally these problems fixed. And this is the first
[63.54s -> 67.30s]  time in probably two and a half weeks where we've had internet for more than like four
[67.30s -> 73.30s]  hours straight. So we're green for the moment. Let's see how, this could be 45 minutes or this
[73.30s -> 79.90s]  could be six hours. I don't know. I'm willing to give it an attempt though. And well,
[79.90s -> 86.14s]  we will update some information about the green screen stream. So you're gonna have to
[86.14s -> 94.26s]  stick around for that. There's some updated info. Here comes a 30 minute stream. All right,
[94.26s -> 132.06s]  give me, give me one second. Also funnily enough, there was, I turned on the PS4
[132.70s -> 137.26s]  because this is where I was Red Dead 2. And I don't know. I think the, the PS4 must
[137.26s -> 144.70s]  have gone into rest mode because we're at the same screen I was at like four and a half
[144.70s -> 153.42s]  days ago. So we're just here. I don't really remember what I was doing, but I know that I
[153.42s -> 164.87s]  exist here. I got to remember the controls too. This is gonna be fucking hard. Even the game was
[164.87s -> 173.34s]  waiting. Yeah. It's like nothing ever happened. You guys just woke up. We all just woke up.
[174.23s -> 182.55s]  And we're here four days later. We got 50, 50 bucks right off the bat from Pocket Pauling.
[182.55s -> 186.79s]  Thanks for the $50 Pocket Pauling. Finally, my dad is back from the war. Hey, Jerma,
[186.79s -> 192.55s]  how sad, relieved are you that you missed the Red Sox parade? Oh yeah, the Red Sox won
[192.55s -> 200.87s]  the World Series. That's right. That happened. What else has happened in the time that I haven't
[200.87s -> 209.34s]  been awake? I mean streaming, you know, Red Sox won the World Series. Super Smash Brothers
[210.22s -> 219.00s]  is coming out and they did a direct today. And excuse me. Excuse me. Where's my favorite
[219.00s -> 230.07s]  fucking character? Excuse me. Plant? Oh, I thought you guys were calling me a plant.
[230.71s -> 239.27s]  Well, I don't want to give any spoilers for people that haven't watched the direct,
[240.62s -> 250.63s]  but I'm missing somebody real important there, I think. Jerma's a plant. That's right. I'm
[250.63s -> 265.62s]  working. I'm working for him. Minecraft Steve. No, no way. What do you mean I wouldn't let
[265.62s -> 270.52s]  that happen? I don't work for Nintendo. No, I would never let that happen. This is not like
[270.52s -> 275.82s]  me playing Red Dead right now. What am I talking about? I would like I would talk to somebody.
[276.54s -> 286.33s]  Oh my fucking Jesus. Hold on. Thank you. Thank you. Jabba dab for your 10 community sub.
[287.05s -> 292.04s]  Thanks a lot, man. Thanks. Also, by the way, pocket Pauling. We didn't really touch upon your
[292.04s -> 298.38s]  $50 here. Like for real, thank you so much. Pocket Pauling for your 50 bucks and jabba
[298.38s -> 305.48s]  dab for your 10 community subs. And I think we I think we can go. You know what I'm
[305.48s -> 311.62s]  saying? I think we can just go. I got it. How do you ride the horse? I forget. Here we go.
[312.18s -> 321.67s]  What was I doing? Okay, I'm back in it. Is it x? I forget how to play. Do you just I just
[321.67s -> 331.02s]  woke up from a fucking dream. Okay, stalling. I don't remember how to shoot. I was in the
[331.02s -> 337.74s]  middle of the tutorial and I went into cryogenic sleep to get the train. You want to
[337.74s -> 343.83s]  head down? See how he's getting on? Okay. No, I remember. Okay, but I'm getting some
[343.91s -> 356.42s]  memories. Check on Bill. That's a gun. Okay. How do I take out the
[361.99s -> 366.39s]  doctor binocular? What was benign? Was there a binocular button? Do I do I go? Am I going
[366.39s -> 379.94s]  down? You know, I have to leave. I'm holding a knife. L one and R one. There we go. Okay.
[382.78s -> 401.99s]  Let's check on Bill. How's he doing? All right, put him up. Get on the horse.
[401.99s -> 405.75s]  This is I didn't even get to fucking do this. It's been four and a half days.
[406.23s -> 423.59s]  No, god damn it. Okay, zoom. Where are you, Bill? This is this what I'm supposed to be doing.
[432.28s -> 436.36s]  Guys, give me a break. There he is. Okay. Where's he on the hill?
[440.28s -> 450.87s]  Okay, there he is. All right, spotted. I gotta I gotta move my horse out of here.
[451.11s -> 457.19s]  Set up the detonator by those rocks over there. Okay, sure. Now just unspool the wire and then
[457.19s -> 463.75s]  attach it to said detonator. I'm going to explode here. Pick up the spool.
[468.54s -> 474.81s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna like acme this guy. You're about to get wily coyote.
[475.61s -> 492.28s]  How much slack do we have? All right, here we go. Attach it.
[494.15s -> 508.49s]  This is attach the thing mini game or what? Okay. Okay. All right. Now stomp on detonator.
[516.47s -> 523.56s]  What if I just jump on this? Imagine if it just fucking blew up.
[526.47s -> 532.98s]  All right, I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Put the horse on the tracks. I just got this
[532.98s -> 544.73s]  horse. Why would I do something like that? I just bought the horse. All right, so I
[544.73s -> 549.69s]  have to detonate it. So I blow up the train. He says all fine. We'll soon find out.
[551.29s -> 558.01s]  Put yourself on the tracks. I think so. Okay, cover your faces. Train should be here any
[558.01s -> 574.47s]  minute now. Weapon wheel. So now we're looking for the detonator. The light.
[584.04s -> 588.42s]  I thought I had to like throw the fuse. It's not radio controlled.
[589.38s -> 599.32s]  Gentlemen, it's time. Good luck. All of you. You all know what to do.
[600.12s -> 604.28s]  I don't know. I actually don't because I saw the first part of this mission and story
[605.08s -> 613.62s]  almost four and a half, five days ago. Here we go. All right, that just didn't work.
[622.38s -> 626.79s]  Why are we getting off the horses? Wait, why would we get off the horse?
[628.87s -> 631.51s]  Jump on the train. How am I supposed to do that from here?
[638.78s -> 655.74s]  Okay, I've made it. Oh, running a train. All right, give me a Lenin. Pull, pull him.
[660.54s -> 662.78s]  Wait, oh, did he fall or did I fall?
[667.58s -> 676.06s]  Come on, this is what it's supposed to be doing, right? What? What am I doing?
[679.53s -> 692.23s]  Okay, I think I figured out what I'm supposed to do. What's the uh, okay.
[694.07s -> 699.94s]  All right, let's go. Stop the train. It's not TNT barrels here, right?
[707.26s -> 722.89s]  I like the repeater. I was going for a tackle. All right, quick. I got to need something.
[723.45s -> 732.12s]  Give me some cover. Wait, wait, no, we gotta go. What the fuck?
[734.15s -> 737.26s]  I just got hit in the face with a shovel. Reverse the grapple.
[737.98s -> 754.57s]  Is this Abe Lincoln? All right, give it the front of the engine car.
[764.01s -> 782.52s]  There's more. Right in the face. I have dead eye, so I don't know why I'm not using it
[783.24s -> 786.22s]  for some reason. What's the reload button?
[792.44s -> 797.42s]  Can I get like an ammo toss to me? That's it, right?
[798.06s -> 811.22s]  That guy. I need to pick up stuff on the ground. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[812.50s -> 827.53s]  Is that a person in the back? Is that an animal? That's a person. Oh shit. Oh shit. Get behind
[827.53s -> 836.33s]  this little fucking slab. Wait, this is our guys? Oh, these are our guys. All right. Wait,
[836.33s -> 847.11s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to. It's a rock. It's a slab. That's a slab. Okay.
[854.33s -> 857.61s]  Assume yellow tonic to fortify your bars. A fortified bar can be used for a short period
[857.61s -> 863.29s]  without draining. This tonic will fortify your dead eye. Listen to me. Okay. We don't want to
[863.29s -> 874.89s]  kill any of you. Any more of you. I give you my word, but trust me, we will. Boys,
[875.85s -> 888.25s]  okay. You asked for it. Five, three, two, one. Seems our friends have gone deaf.
[888.25s -> 891.93s]  I don't, I don't know what the, what the world war two plane sound was coming from outside.
[892.65s -> 906.49s]  Are we going? I can't rapid fire this time. Mr. Williamson, give Mr. Morgan and Mr. Smith
[906.49s -> 912.54s]  some dynamite. You two boys go blow that door open. Why don't we do that? Thanks bill.
[913.42s -> 920.68s]  Much to us, but you boys in there might want to take a step back.
[921.24s -> 926.20s]  Place dynamite. Seems good enough. All right. Here we go. Like the views. Here we go.
[926.20s -> 939.42s]  All right. Now step back. Unless you got a death wish. I'd step back, fellas. Yeah,
[939.42s -> 945.59s]  I did this. I did this. All right. Now go in and just start firing.
[954.57s -> 967.50s]  Blind him. Get on up and search that train. What's the punch button? I want to punch. It's
[967.50s -> 977.99s]  all right. Let's search the damn train. Look at this place. It's like a, it's beautiful in here.
[978.87s -> 983.75s]  You two got the safe. I'll search the rest. Oh yes. Should be easy as cake.
[986.31s -> 988.95s]  If I'm going to hide something, I would hide it inside the lamp.
[989.67s -> 995.59s]  Shut up. Me and Arthur did all the work. Yeah, kid did good. Didn't see you rushing to jump on
[995.59s -> 999.51s]  that train. He's king. I'll give you that. On receipt of funds, we proceed with phases two
[999.51s -> 1002.07s]  and three of the project and present you with a detailed report of our findings within
[1002.07s -> 1007.43s]  the month. Yours, respectively. Okay, let's see if we can get this open. Now that wasn't part
[1007.43s -> 1017.53s]  of it. Getting there. What's in there? Cigars? I can't carry any more of this item. I need
[1017.53s -> 1033.32s]  to sell some shit then. Any codes? No, no codes. You can screenshot that and read it later if you
[1033.32s -> 1040.01s]  want. All right, there's brandy. I'm going to need to do something eventually here, food wise.
[1042.97s -> 1048.65s]  Can't carry any more of this item. Why not?
[1049.93s -> 1067.43s]  Can somebody else hold something? Money? That's money. Those are IOUs. No, it tells you. Bond.
[1076.57s -> 1080.68s]  Is it really a lock box if it's unlocked? That's true.
[1080.68s -> 1088.65s]  What did you find? These. They worth anything? Oh, sure. Bearer bonds. I think we can probably
[1088.65s -> 1092.97s]  sell these pretty easily. Oh, wait, is that Ethereum? Well done. Now, would you get rid of
[1092.97s -> 1098.65s]  all of this? The train? Yeah, get it out of here. What about them? What do you think?
[1098.65s -> 1104.38s]  I don't know. It's up to you. Kill them, leave them here, take them with you on the train.
[1105.10s -> 1107.82s]  Just make sure they don't send our folk after us. Wait, I get temporary party members?
[1107.82s -> 1111.18s]  Okay, see you back at camp. What do I do about these three?
[1111.74s -> 1121.98s]  We'll be moving on. The rest of you, let's ride. What do I do with my temporary party? Guard.
[1121.98s -> 1131.06s]  Deal with the guards. Can I pick who I threaten? Okay, get on the train. Quick.
[1138.82s -> 1156.60s]  Wait, I gotta get you too. Hey, what's going on? What happened? What are the boundaries?
[1159.66s -> 1168.20s]  Why are the boundaries here? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Somebody gave 100 bucks.
[1169.40s -> 1174.44s]  Mega Mube just gave $100. Thank you so much, dude. Haven't been able to watch you stream
[1174.44s -> 1178.04s]  very much recently, but still love every second of the VODs. Hope this helps a little with
[1178.04s -> 1184.92s]  settling into the new place. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mega Mube. Well, you
[1184.92s -> 1187.72s]  haven't been able to watch very much recently. I haven't really been able to stream very
[1187.72s -> 1191.82s]  much recently. So all right, so let's do this the actual way I'm supposed to do it.
[1191.82s -> 1198.73s]  Okay, get on the train. Quick. Any bright ideas? I kill all three. Yeah.
[1202.60s -> 1210.34s]  Oh, I don't have, I don't have anything else. Well, I want this instead. Get on the train.
[1211.38s -> 1222.39s]  I hear so much as a footstep from this car. You'll end up like all your friends out here.
[1223.11s -> 1228.44s]  I have honor level. I told you to get on the train. Look, all you had, I'm not,
[1228.92s -> 1235.32s]  if you follow instructions, you're gonna be fine. How do I take, I need to go to the engine car?
[1235.32s -> 1248.15s]  What do they leave? What if they run away? I'm supposed to leave them back here? I don't know
[1248.15s -> 1253.90s]  if I want to do that. No, I'm not gonna, these guys listen. These guys follow directions.
[1260.60s -> 1282.41s]  Can I climb? What, what's going on? What was that? Okay, my horse is fine. How do I know
[1282.41s -> 1285.93s]  that they're gonna stay? Well, if I'm that guy, I'm just gonna walk off the train right
[1285.93s -> 1293.46s]  now. I'll know where to be found. They are running. What are you talking about? They're
[1293.46s -> 1309.51s]  running. No, that where? No, they're not. They're gonna remember this. That's fine.
[1310.07s -> 1318.79s]  I want them to. One person said that. It doesn't matter how many people say it.
[1320.46s -> 1339.14s]  Let's get this thing moving. Why don't I stay on the train? If I'm one of these guys,
[1339.14s -> 1347.21s]  I'm gonna lean out the window and be like, sucker. I would throw a rock out the window at
[1347.21s -> 1355.46s]  him. As you're gonna get, you can catch the train. There's a bunch of heavy books in there.
[1355.46s -> 1357.78s]  I'd whip a book at him and try to hit him right in the head as hard as I could.
[1358.58s -> 1365.19s]  I'd probably miss. You ever try to throw something as hard as you can at something
[1365.19s -> 1367.03s]  and you just do way off? That's what happens every time.
[1385.38s -> 1392.34s]  Not very nice. I'm an outlaw. You want me to tuck him into bed?
[1401.78s -> 1402.34s]  Yes.
[1412.18s -> 1434.54s]  Tuck him in nice. Well, that's a nice icy waterfall. I'm glad we're getting to the title
[1434.54s -> 1457.90s]  screen song with lyrics because that's definitely where we are. This just sounds like somebody
[1457.90s -> 1463.82s]  that's at karaoke and they don't know the lyrics to the song for a whole portion and then
[1463.82s -> 1470.62s]  she's going to sing the chorus. I don't even know the fucking chorus. Wow.
[1494.12s -> 1520.39s]  That sounds pretty good. No, it's too easy. That's too easy. It's too easy to dump them
[1520.39s -> 1530.87s]  during the song. It's too easy. Wait. Oh, I thought the horse went through the earth. Hey, go.
[1536.50s -> 1542.84s]  I thought that the horse went all the way through. That was a preemptive.
[1542.84s -> 1546.28s]  I'm laughing. What the fuck? How do we lose a wheel?
[1547.08s -> 1551.43s]  Okay. Let's take a look.
[1551.43s -> 1552.23s]  That's supposed to happen.
[1553.53s -> 1556.89s]  What's going on? I broke the goddamn wheel.
[1558.01s -> 1562.01s]  Let's get it fixed. You need help? I reckon we can handle it.
[1574.81s -> 1587.43s]  Okay. Lift it up. I'm playing house slipper again. That's all it takes. Oh yeah. This
[1587.43s -> 1593.11s]  is back in like the 1100s, right? The wheel was just invented.
[1594.54s -> 1596.54s]  Of course they're going to have technical problems with it.
[1633.54s -> 1640.79s]  Here comes the whole story. Back to the wagon.
[1646.20s -> 1649.56s]  You can switch between different radar sizes in the compass by holding that.
[1653.59s -> 1660.49s]  Expand. No, no, no. Regular is fine. I'll keep it on regular. That's fine.
[1660.49s -> 1663.29s]  The Indians in these parts got sold a very raw deal.
[1664.38s -> 1668.30s]  This is the heartland we're going to. Good farming and grazing country.
[1669.34s -> 1672.22s]  We're just browsing around right now. We can take our time here.
[1672.22s -> 1677.90s]  Every blade of grass killed or heard it up to the reservations in the middle of nowhere.
[1677.90s -> 1683.00s]  It's not different from anywhere else. This is more scenic. Maybe it's not.
[1683.00s -> 1684.68s]  Kangaroo. Kangaroo. Get the kangaroo.
[1684.68s -> 1686.84s]  I'm sure some of the army out here was particularly
[1687.88s -> 1694.49s]  That's a four legged kangaroo. How do I take out my gun?
[1694.49s -> 1701.96s]  I fear I was perhaps trying to simplify something more complicated
[1701.96s -> 1704.76s]  for the benefit of our block headed driver here.
[1704.76s -> 1707.72s]  Hey, hey, don't blame it on me.
[1708.68s -> 1713.16s]  Never forget. This here's a con man, Charles. Born and bred.
[1713.72s -> 1720.04s]  Just because it sounds fancy don't mean he knows a damn thing about what he's talking about.
[1720.04s -> 1721.88s]  I'm trying. I'm just going regular speed.
[1723.26s -> 1726.26s]  So what happened to your tribe?
[1727.22s -> 1730.71s]  I don't even know. At least not that I can remember.
[1730.71s -> 1733.32s]  My father was a cousin.
[1733.32s -> 1736.76s]  Yes, the southern kangaroo. We just ran a squirrel over.
[1736.76s -> 1737.96s]  A number of freemen did.
[1738.92s -> 1742.74s]  Move from our land. Three of us fled.
[1742.74s -> 1745.94s]  You got to know a family of like four is going to drive by then.
[1745.94s -> 1749.62s]  They're all going to turn their heads and go, oh, no.
[1749.62s -> 1752.10s]  A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother.
[1752.10s -> 1755.22s]  Took her somewhere. We never saw her again.
[1755.22s -> 1759.40s]  We drifted around. He was a very sad man.
[1759.40s -> 1761.56s]  Where clothes appropriate to move around.
[1761.56s -> 1764.94s]  I'm 13. I just took off on my own.
[1764.94s -> 1767.78s]  That was about the age we found young Arthur here.
[1767.78s -> 1770.76s]  Maybe a little older. Delinquent.
[1770.76s -> 1773.40s]  You never did see. But he learned fast.
[1774.12s -> 1776.71s]  Not as fast as Marston, apparently.
[1777.59s -> 1779.59s]  Wait. I don't understand.
[1780.23s -> 1781.91s]  What's the problem between you two?
[1781.91s -> 1782.63s]  Nice shot.
[1783.51s -> 1785.03s]  It's a long story.
[1787.46s -> 1789.22s]  Do a flip with the carriage.
[1789.22s -> 1791.14s]  We still heading the right way?
[1791.14s -> 1795.70s]  That depends. Are we still heading west in search of fortune
[1795.70s -> 1798.66s]  and repose in virgin forests as we plan?
[1799.30s -> 1802.02s]  No. Are we heading in the correct direction
[1802.02s -> 1805.22s]  on our desperate escape from the law eastwards down the mountain?
[1805.22s -> 1806.26s]  We're going the right way still.
[1806.26s -> 1808.02s]  Yes, I believe so.
[1808.02s -> 1809.46s]  You know this area?
[1809.46s -> 1812.02s]  A little. I've been through a couple of times.
[1812.82s -> 1816.18s]  There's a livestock town not too far from here called Valentine.
[1816.82s -> 1820.10s]  Cowboys, outlaws, working girls.
[1820.10s -> 1821.14s]  Our kind of place.
[1823.46s -> 1824.26s]  This is boring?
[1824.26s -> 1825.62s]  Hey, we're doing the tutorial, man.
[1825.62s -> 1826.74s]  We're just trying to enjoy the game.
[1826.74s -> 1828.02s]  In this place, we're going.
[1828.74s -> 1830.90s]  Wait, what's it called again?
[1830.98s -> 1832.26s]  Horseshoe Overlook.
[1832.26s -> 1833.46s]  I don't think I can even control this.
[1833.46s -> 1834.34s]  Is this a good place to lie low?
[1834.34s -> 1834.98s]  It'll do for now.
[1834.98s -> 1836.58s]  I can't go anywhere because I'm straight.
[1836.58s -> 1838.82s]  How long do you think Dutch is really going to lie?
[1839.86s -> 1844.10s]  It's just, you know, maybe it's me who's changed, not him.
[1844.10s -> 1848.10s]  But we kept telling him that fairy job didn't feel right.
[1848.74s -> 1851.62s]  You and me had a real lead in Blackwater that could have worked out.
[1853.54s -> 1856.02s]  It just isn't like Dutch to lose his head like that.
[1856.02s -> 1857.38s]  When do we fight the wild west orcs?
[1857.38s -> 1862.65s]  Things go wrong sometimes. It's the way it is.
[1862.65s -> 1863.13s]  What?
[1863.13s -> 1865.10s]  It always has been.
[1865.10s -> 1866.70s]  This isn't like Skyrim.
[1866.70s -> 1871.48s]  Dutch, abandon this line of work.
[1871.48s -> 1883.03s]  We're still here, so I figure we must have got a ride to hell.
[1883.03s -> 1884.47s]  Who's eating?
[1884.47s -> 1886.92s]  We work here anyway.
[1886.92s -> 1889.56s]  Just some yarrow and ginseng.
[1889.56s -> 1890.28s]  Good for the health.
[1891.24s -> 1893.56s]  Better than that stuff you buy in the store.
[1893.56s -> 1895.72s]  Yeah, you can have all this.
[1896.60s -> 1899.32s]  I'm at the point where I can do it with my eyes closed.
[1899.32s -> 1901.88s]  Why don't you just wish sometimes that you could just eat this and be fine?
[1901.88s -> 1908.92s]  Eating sometimes is just a pain in the ass, don't you guys think?
[1910.36s -> 1915.58s]  I mean, I love food, but they're going to be annoying.
[1915.58s -> 1916.70s]  It's something you have to do.
[1916.70s -> 1917.50s]  It's like sleeping.
[1918.22s -> 1919.50s]  Think about your entire day.
[1921.78s -> 1924.98s]  Like 60% of your whole day is eating and sleeping.
[1925.78s -> 1926.42s]  Come on, man.
[1926.42s -> 1929.50s]  Like, where's the science there?
[1929.50s -> 1929.98s]  Let's go.
[1945.85s -> 1946.89s]  Oh, boy.
[1946.89s -> 1948.33s]  This discussion again.
[1949.21s -> 1955.99s]  So just stop eating.
[1955.99s -> 1956.87s]  What's the big deal?
[1957.75s -> 1972.94s]  Oh, stop the wagon.
[1975.56s -> 1976.84s]  Turn and stop.
[1981.75s -> 1982.07s]  Stop.
[1982.95s -> 1984.36s]  Do I have to back it up?
[1987.83s -> 1988.63s]  All right, back up.
[1989.43s -> 1997.78s]  Where is he?
[1998.42s -> 2002.09s]  He's right around this rock.
[2006.38s -> 2007.88s]  Telephone's ringing.
[2009.59s -> 2010.07s]  All right.
[2010.07s -> 2011.27s]  There he is over here, right?
[2013.82s -> 2014.38s]  Where is he?
[2015.02s -> 2015.98s]  Oh, my God.
[2015.98s -> 2017.10s]  Where is he?
[2017.10s -> 2022.74s]  Wasn't he right here?
[2027.13s -> 2031.05s]  Look at the map.
[2031.05s -> 2033.53s]  I mean, yeah, but oh, there he is.
[2033.53s -> 2035.77s]  He just he got stuck in my shit, so he started walking.
[2036.57s -> 2042.12s]  All right, get on.
[2043.00s -> 2043.48s]  Can I beep?
[2051.29s -> 2052.09s]  Run him over.
[2052.09s -> 2054.09s]  No, I have to be like at least a decent person.
[2054.73s -> 2055.37s]  All right, get on.
[2064.30s -> 2064.78s]  Get on.
[2067.35s -> 2068.07s]  Where's the beep?
[2068.71s -> 2070.23s]  How do I beep at this guy?
[2081.08s -> 2087.48s]  Where is he?
[2087.48s -> 2088.68s]  Where did he disappear?
[2098.12s -> 2099.32s]  All right, we made it.
[2100.04s -> 2101.16s]  Home sweet home.
[2101.16s -> 2101.96s]  There we are.
[2101.96s -> 2103.00s]  Good thing you made it.
[2111.62s -> 2112.58s]  He made it before we did.
[2113.14s -> 2122.50s]  I've never seen somebody fuck this section up.
[2122.50s -> 2125.38s]  Well, have you ever seen somebody do that whole section in cinematic mode?
[2132.28s -> 2133.08s]  Now you have it.
[2133.08s -> 2133.48s]  Now you have it.
[2133.48s -> 2133.88s]  Now you have it.
[2133.88s -> 2134.20s]  Now you have it.
[2134.20s -> 2134.60s]  Now you have it.
[2143.10s -> 2150.57s]  Every last one of us kept us together, kept us alive, kept the nooses off our neck.
[2151.21s -> 2153.29s]  I guess I'm just worried.
[2153.93s -> 2155.37s]  I ain't got that long, Dutch.
[2155.37s -> 2157.05s]  I want folks safe before I go.
[2157.05s -> 2157.77s]  Me too.
[2157.77s -> 2160.73s]  And now we are stuck east of the Grizzlies and out of money
[2161.37s -> 2165.05s]  and a long way from our dream of virgin land in the west.
[2165.05s -> 2168.41s]  I know, my brother, but we are safe.
[2168.41s -> 2172.09s]  We make a bit of money here, then we move again, head out around
[2172.09s -> 2172.49s]  Nice.
[2172.73s -> 2173.93s]  West of Uncle Sam.
[2173.93s -> 2176.81s]  That's really hard to do by some land.
[2176.81s -> 2177.45s]  I hope so.
[2178.09s -> 2181.77s]  Would you just look around you?
[2183.42s -> 2186.14s]  This world has its consolation.
[2187.72s -> 2191.88s]  Gentlemen, I'm going to head into the local town and, you know,
[2192.52s -> 2194.76s]  see if I can strike up a little business.
[2195.32s -> 2199.40s]  Of course, hair strows up for robbing banks to usury.
[2200.04s -> 2202.28s]  Seems more dignified somehow.
[2203.24s -> 2207.00s]  Now, everyone, put your tools down for a moment.
[2207.00s -> 2209.08s]  Come on, gather around quickly now.
[2209.08s -> 2210.20s]  I'm going to get a speech.
[2210.20s -> 2214.28s]  I know that things have been tough, but we are free.
[2214.28s -> 2216.60s]  Oh, coming in with five community subs.
[2218.63s -> 2219.75s]  Thanks a lot, man.
[2219.75s -> 2222.15s]  For everyone to get to work.
[2222.15s -> 2224.07s]  Get to work, but stay out of trouble.
[2224.63s -> 2226.63s]  Remember, we are itinerant workers.
[2226.63s -> 2230.39s]  Laid off when they shut down our factory to the north.
[2230.39s -> 2233.75s]  Now, get out there and see what you can find.
[2233.75s -> 2237.19s]  Uncle, Reverend Swanson, no more passengers.
[2238.07s -> 2243.43s]  It is time for everyone to earn their keep.
[2243.43s -> 2246.95s]  There is a town a little way down the track named of Valentine.
[2246.95s -> 2247.51s]  Can you play?
[2247.51s -> 2248.55s]  I'm playing the game.
[2251.27s -> 2251.91s]  This is the game.
[2251.91s -> 2253.19s]  That seems a decent place to start.
[2253.19s -> 2255.99s]  And we need food, real food.
[2255.99s -> 2258.07s]  That means every day, one of you.
[2258.07s -> 2260.87s]  Now, remember, whatever it is that you find.
[2260.87s -> 2264.87s]  Can't have gifts, gifts, slice.
[2266.15s -> 2267.59s]  Now, be sensible out there.
[2269.37s -> 2271.45s]  Now, the girls have your tent ready, Mr. Morgan.
[2271.45s -> 2271.93s]  Come with me.
[2272.73s -> 2274.25s]  You threw away the shorty.
[2274.25s -> 2275.21s]  We put you over here.
[2275.77s -> 2279.05s]  I'm sure everything will be fine, Miss Grimshaw.
[2279.05s -> 2279.69s]  It should be.
[2279.69s -> 2281.85s]  Most of your stuff from Blackwater got saved.
[2281.85s -> 2283.53s]  Everything apart from my money.
[2283.53s -> 2284.89s]  Oh, don't remind me.
[2284.89s -> 2287.37s]  Well, we can always make more money.
[2287.37s -> 2288.25s]  We're going to have to.
[2289.13s -> 2292.41s]  Miss Jackson, I've seen shit with more common sense.
[2292.41s -> 2294.25s]  Sleep shame or change clothes at your tent.
[2296.44s -> 2297.40s]  Burz, I don't know why for a second,
[2297.40s -> 2298.68s]  I thought he was going to burn his clothes.
[2299.85s -> 2301.13s]  I'm done with these.
[2301.13s -> 2302.33s]  I think I'm going to get rid of them.
[2303.45s -> 2309.37s]  Horseshoe Overlook, chapter two.
[2309.37s -> 2310.25s]  That was chapter one?
[2310.25s -> 2311.45s]  How many chapters are there?
[2312.25s -> 2317.00s]  That's not how you guys change clothes.
[2320.73s -> 2321.61s]  What did they do before?
[2322.97s -> 2323.69s]  No, never mind.
[2323.69s -> 2325.05s]  That's a stupid thing to say.
[2325.69s -> 2326.89s]  What did they do before?
[2326.89s -> 2327.39s]  Laundry.
[2327.39s -> 2327.89s]  Laundry.
[2328.59s -> 2329.79s]  They just left this clothes on.
[2335.76s -> 2336.80s]  You rinsed it in a stream.
[2343.36s -> 2345.52s]  Funny guys, funny number joke.
[2348.80s -> 2350.54s]  So this is a few weeks later.
[2365.85s -> 2369.05s]  Eat, drink, play at Dave and Busters.
[2372.09s -> 2373.53s]  You got to maintain your course, don't you?
[2374.65s -> 2376.25s]  Half price Wednesdays.
[2376.25s -> 2379.21s]  Oh, by the way, half price is actually what it should be every day
[2379.21s -> 2381.61s]  because it's like four dollars to play one game here.
[2385.29s -> 2385.85s]  Don't come here.
[2396.24s -> 2396.96s]  What are you saying?
[2396.96s -> 2399.52s]  You guys don't have, you never played, you went to Dave and Busters?
[2400.08s -> 2401.04s]  Camera.
[2401.04s -> 2404.24s]  Your games can't be shown by a symbol on the map.
[2406.68s -> 2408.04s]  Eagle talent, talisman.
[2408.04s -> 2410.04s]  Okay, so your beard is getting long.
[2410.04s -> 2411.40s]  You can use the shaving kit beside your tent
[2411.40s -> 2413.08s]  or visit a barbershop to maintain your facial hair.
[2421.85s -> 2423.13s]  Okay, there's lots of details here.
[2423.13s -> 2423.85s]  Hold on.
[2423.85s -> 2429.10s]  So we got permanently increases the time
[2429.10s -> 2431.18s]  that eagle eye can stay active for five seconds.
[2432.08s -> 2434.40s]  Crafted from rare legendary animal parts.
[2435.20s -> 2438.06s]  Permanently decreases the damage the player receives
[2438.06s -> 2439.42s]  while on horseback by 10 percent.
[2440.38s -> 2441.90s]  Okay, that's interesting.
[2441.90s -> 2443.02s]  You can make little charms.
[2444.25s -> 2446.17s]  178 animals.
[2448.32s -> 2448.82s]  What?
[2451.00s -> 2452.68s]  There were like four in the last game.
[2453.58s -> 2460.54s]  Deer, bear, coyote, and like rabbit, right?
[2462.38s -> 2465.66s]  Six gangs, 30 fish, 74 pieces of equipment.
[2465.66s -> 2466.54s]  This seems huge.
[2467.26s -> 2474.22s]  Hey, I discovered the deer and the bears.
[2474.78s -> 2475.42s]  Where's the bear?
[2476.14s -> 2478.70s]  How have I not discovered the bear?
[2479.34s -> 2481.28s]  I literally shot him in the face with an arrow.
[2484.14s -> 2485.10s]  It's easy to track them.
[2488.91s -> 2489.47s]  Okay, I see.
[2490.28s -> 2490.78s]  All right.
[2495.64s -> 2498.28s]  Bring Pearson animals to supply the camp.
[2498.28s -> 2499.32s]  You can use the meat for food
[2499.32s -> 2501.64s]  and the skins to craft satchels with increased capacity.
[2502.52s -> 2504.48s]  All right, there's a lot going on.
[2504.48s -> 2505.04s]  Let me take a look.
[2506.56s -> 2508.00s]  I don't care what that guy has to say right now.
[2509.82s -> 2510.54s]  Let's do some shaving.
[2512.43s -> 2513.15s]  Now, is this like...
[2514.11s -> 2515.63s]  Is this like the...
[2515.63s -> 2516.75s]  You guys remember...
[2516.75s -> 2518.19s]  No one's going to know what I'm talking about here.
[2518.83s -> 2522.41s]  The magnet face thing
[2522.41s -> 2524.49s]  where you have the magnet hair on the guy's face.
[2524.49s -> 2530.89s]  It was like a 14 cent toy length.
[2533.76s -> 2535.36s]  Oh, you actually can do this.
[2536.00s -> 2539.47s]  Hold on, chin.
[2541.90s -> 2543.26s]  I think I just want a dirty chin.
[2551.26s -> 2552.06s]  I don't know.
[2552.06s -> 2552.78s]  What do you think?
[2554.00s -> 2555.44s]  Just gigantic chops?
[2558.03s -> 2558.53s]  Hmm.
[2563.44s -> 2565.28s]  No, I just want the piece of hair
[2565.28s -> 2567.04s]  from my chin to go down as far as it can go.
[2570.41s -> 2570.91s]  Yeah.
[2583.12s -> 2586.72s]  I'm going to look like an Amish guy.
[2594.72s -> 2595.60s]  Thanos.
[2600.67s -> 2603.79s]  Can I dye my whole face purple and my beard purple?
[2606.24s -> 2606.96s]  Yeah, that's good.
[2608.22s -> 2609.02s]  Okay.
[2609.02s -> 2610.72s]  I like it like this so far.
[2610.72s -> 2613.85s]  I'm going to keep that going as long as it can go.
[2617.77s -> 2622.41s]  The current stock levels are shown when near the tithing box.
[2623.29s -> 2624.52s]  All right, let's take a look.
[2626.24s -> 2628.40s]  Now, that's perfectly balanced facial hair.
[2629.04s -> 2631.96s]  Here's something to make a stew.
[2631.96s -> 2632.92s]  You can eat from the pot.
[2633.48s -> 2637.18s]  I'm getting a lot of info here.
[2646.48s -> 2647.68s]  They demanded no.
[2647.68s -> 2649.84s]  It's like lore in case you want to see it.
[2653.98s -> 2655.58s]  Let me just like take it in for a second here
[2655.58s -> 2656.78s]  because here's the donation box.
[2657.66s -> 2659.50s]  How much money should I give?
[2660.46s -> 2661.02s]  Contribute.
[2661.66s -> 2663.05s]  How much can I contribute?
[2663.05s -> 2665.40s]  Are you going to serve them?
[2665.40s -> 2666.36s]  If I don't give money.
[2666.36s -> 2668.49s]  It'll be ready.
[2668.49s -> 2668.99s]  Okay.
[2679.28s -> 2679.92s]  I did my...
[2682.12s -> 2682.62s]  Somebody's...
[2683.16s -> 2685.64s]  Somebody's slurping out of a big gulp?
[2685.64s -> 2686.36s]  What the hell was that?
[2686.92s -> 2695.00s]  It was a radio.
[2695.00s -> 2697.08s]  I thought somebody said like a giant soda.
[2697.88s -> 2704.17s]  Let's keep looking around.
[2704.17s -> 2704.67s]  Hold on.
[2705.21s -> 2705.77s]  Food.
[2705.77s -> 2706.65s]  Let me eat some stew.
[2709.66s -> 2710.78s]  That's less than a hundred bits.
[2710.78s -> 2711.50s]  I ain't going to read it.
[2712.38s -> 2713.05s]  Let's see.
[2713.05s -> 2713.61s]  It's a stew.
[2713.61s -> 2714.49s]  What kind of stew is it?
[2722.17s -> 2722.73s]  Is it not done?
[2727.84s -> 2728.64s]  I want some of that.
[2729.28s -> 2730.32s]  How do I get some of that?
[2738.25s -> 2738.65s]  Oh, okay.
[2738.65s -> 2739.05s]  I have to take...
[2739.05s -> 2740.41s]  I have to actually pick the bowl up.
[2740.41s -> 2743.45s]  This is the two parts here.
[2744.17s -> 2748.70s]  I only get to eat once every few days.
[2749.50s -> 2756.73s]  I can just walk around and talk while eating.
[2760.59s -> 2760.83s]  All right.
[2760.83s -> 2761.55s]  This is pretty cool.
[2761.55s -> 2761.95s]  All right.
[2761.95s -> 2762.43s]  This is good.
[2763.23s -> 2769.87s]  Can I throw it like acid?
[2769.87s -> 2770.91s]  Can I throw it in somebody's face?
[2777.47s -> 2777.87s]  I want to talk.
[2780.64s -> 2780.80s]  All right.
[2780.80s -> 2781.44s]  I'm going to sit here.
[2786.92s -> 2790.35s]  Am I allowed at this part at the lunch table?
[2794.51s -> 2794.91s]  What the fuck?
[2794.91s -> 2795.87s]  Nobody wants to talk to me.
[2797.31s -> 2799.31s]  I can't sit with the cool kids at the lunch table?
[2811.36s -> 2811.84s]  Hey.
[2811.84s -> 2812.96s]  No, I wasn't done with that.
[2814.80s -> 2816.16s]  Sit back down and eat the rest of that.
[2823.64s -> 2823.88s]  Okay.
[2823.88s -> 2824.28s]  I can talk.
[2824.28s -> 2827.32s]  I can see anything when you rode ahead.
[2827.32s -> 2828.68s]  Nothing we need to worry about.
[2828.68s -> 2829.72s]  Okay.
[2829.72s -> 2830.04s]  Good.
[2833.02s -> 2833.50s]  That was a...
[2834.22s -> 2836.38s]  That was as shitty as a conversation as
[2836.38s -> 2838.14s]  what's the weather like in this...
[2838.14s -> 2839.10s]  Look at that weather, huh?
[2840.06s -> 2843.32s]  I only get to eat once every three days
[2843.32s -> 2844.60s]  and I'm going to leave half my plate.
[2845.32s -> 2848.48s]  What am I?
[2848.48s -> 2849.36s]  At the olive garden?
[2850.00s -> 2854.52s]  Okay.
[2855.24s -> 2856.96s]  What's over here?
[2857.60s -> 2865.52s]  Oh, this guy.
[2865.52s -> 2866.80s]  This is the guy shaving the turkey.
[2867.96s -> 2868.84s]  Crafting upgrades.
[2868.84s -> 2869.24s]  Donate.
[2869.24s -> 2873.72s]  I'm going to meet here soon if we're not careful.
[2873.72s -> 2876.44s]  Well, let's get some meat so we get a feather.
[2878.62s -> 2879.02s]  You can have...
[2881.79s -> 2882.99s]  You can have a bird feather.
[2883.71s -> 2887.42s]  Thank you.
[2889.53s -> 2890.17s]  I'm getting money here.
[2891.45s -> 2892.25s]  Donate all.
[2892.25s -> 2893.37s]  Donate for provisions.
[2894.33s -> 2895.21s]  I think I want to do that.
[2895.77s -> 2900.86s]  Donated.
[2901.58s -> 2902.62s]  Just bring me meat.
[2902.62s -> 2903.18s]  Donated.
[2903.18s -> 2904.06s]  I'm just going to give it to him.
[2904.86s -> 2908.68s]  This is fish meat.
[2910.44s -> 2911.72s]  Two pieces of meat.
[2911.72s -> 2912.92s]  And we got some venison here.
[2913.64s -> 2916.81s]  Can I like cook on the...
[2916.81s -> 2917.93s]  I'm just going to give them all.
[2917.93s -> 2918.65s]  Just take it all.
[2919.53s -> 2921.87s]  Don't say like I never gave you nothing.
[2921.87s -> 2926.19s]  Just take it.
[2930.59s -> 2931.07s]  Oh, shit.
[2931.07s -> 2931.63s]  Okay, hold on.
[2932.35s -> 2934.73s]  Can I not give these?
[2935.77s -> 2940.14s]  All right, so crafting upgrades.
[2940.14s -> 2940.94s]  Let's see what I can do here.
[2940.94s -> 2943.58s]  I'm very into my crafting at the moment, Mr. Morgan.
[2943.58s -> 2944.86s]  Okay, so craft satchel.
[2944.86s -> 2946.06s]  Increase carrying capacity.
[2947.18s -> 2949.85s]  Tonic satchel.
[2950.57s -> 2952.33s]  I can't do any of these.
[2954.78s -> 2955.66s]  Oh, god damn it.
[2955.66s -> 2956.22s]  I need like...
[2958.16s -> 2959.36s]  Fusion cannot craft this yet.
[2959.36s -> 2960.24s]  I can't craft any of these.
[2960.96s -> 2962.43s]  Okay.
[2964.38s -> 2966.78s]  So I need to purchase leather working tools
[2966.78s -> 2968.38s]  and upgrade the medicine wagon twice.
[2969.58s -> 2970.78s]  I got so much work to do.
[2970.78s -> 2971.90s]  There's a lot of work here.
[2972.70s -> 2974.75s]  I can make my own house.
[2975.47s -> 2980.48s]  I need one perfect ram carcass.
[2981.12s -> 2983.40s]  Cleaned up ram skull to be displayed at your tent.
[2986.68s -> 2987.32s]  Rugs.
[2987.32s -> 2988.12s]  I don't have anything.
[2989.79s -> 2991.95s]  Upgrade the main camp's campfire.
[2992.91s -> 2995.69s]  I don't have any of this shit.
[2995.69s -> 2996.97s]  I need to like play the game first.
[2999.16s -> 3000.52s]  All right, well, thanks for the money.
[3001.16s -> 3003.32s]  What about you?
[3006.62s -> 3008.11s]  Oh, there's a guy over here.
[3008.67s -> 3009.95s]  What do the exclamation points mean?
[3010.67s -> 3013.66s]  Oh, these are provisions or something, right?
[3014.62s -> 3016.14s]  I can take a certain amount of provisions every day.
[3017.10s -> 3018.30s]  I'm assuming they're not grayed out.
[3021.68s -> 3022.80s]  Right, that would make sense, wouldn't it?
[3024.54s -> 3025.98s]  Needs to be restocked.
[3025.98s -> 3026.70s]  Okay.
[3026.70s -> 3027.50s]  Well, I'm just gonna go.
[3028.30s -> 3028.94s]  Let's do a mission.
[3029.58s -> 3034.56s]  Where's my horse?
[3040.14s -> 3041.66s]  Do the mission, do the mission.
[3041.66s -> 3043.26s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[3043.26s -> 3045.90s]  How are we doing on our stamina?
[3047.05s -> 3049.53s]  You can command your horse to stay, flee, or follow
[3049.53s -> 3051.37s]  by focusing on it with the L2 when it's nearby.
[3053.53s -> 3053.77s]  Yes.
[3053.77s -> 3057.82s]  I, I'm on it currently.
[3057.82s -> 3061.90s]  All right, so we got G, E, U, or R, S.
[3062.78s -> 3064.70s]  We're gonna, we're gonna go towards G, E.
[3073.82s -> 3075.18s]  Galloping horses cause stamina to drain.
[3075.18s -> 3075.42s]  Hold on.
[3075.42s -> 3075.98s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3076.86s -> 3078.62s]  173 bullets.
[3078.62s -> 3079.90s]  41, 173.
[3080.86s -> 3085.82s]  Okay, I have ammo, so I'm just gonna go.
[3086.46s -> 3090.80s]  Hold X to maintain the horse's canter
[3090.80s -> 3091.68s]  and punch some stamina.
[3091.68s -> 3092.08s]  Sounds good.
[3099.47s -> 3103.92s]  The world has opened up now.
[3104.56s -> 3106.92s]  We're going to the first mission.
[3115.98s -> 3116.86s]  Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[3116.86s -> 3117.82s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3117.82s -> 3118.78s]  Wait, wait, wait, an animal.
[3118.78s -> 3120.62s]  An animal I can, I can take and bring back to the,
[3120.62s -> 3121.74s]  to the, what is it?
[3121.74s -> 3122.70s]  It's a turkey.
[3122.70s -> 3123.34s]  It's a turkey.
[3126.28s -> 3127.08s]  Study the turkey.
[3127.80s -> 3131.32s]  Where is it?
[3131.32s -> 3131.80s]  There it is.
[3131.80s -> 3132.28s]  Study it.
[3134.09s -> 3134.89s]  Can I talk to them?
[3135.69s -> 3137.45s]  How did you, I ran it over.
[3138.09s -> 3142.76s]  All right, let's go study them.
[3142.76s -> 3160.36s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[3160.36s -> 3160.92s]  Bird meat.
[3161.56s -> 3163.00s]  When you skin or pluck an animal,
[3163.00s -> 3164.52s]  you take meat from the car cause you can cook
[3164.52s -> 3165.88s]  and eat this meat at a campfire.
[3165.88s -> 3166.84s]  I, we need to take this back.
[3167.72s -> 3173.80s]  Can I like throw it at somebody?
[3175.08s -> 3175.96s]  No, that's a gun.
[3176.68s -> 3177.72s]  All right, we're going to take this back.
[3178.36s -> 3184.49s]  All right, there's another one over here.
[3184.49s -> 3185.21s]  Where's the other turkey?
[3189.90s -> 3191.10s]  Pick up and examine.
[3191.82s -> 3194.06s]  So it's a random wild mushroom.
[3194.78s -> 3200.81s]  Parasol mushroom is a health herb.
[3200.81s -> 3202.33s]  It can be eaten to refill your health core
[3202.33s -> 3203.77s]  or be crafted to as bait.
[3204.41s -> 3205.21s]  What can I eat?
[3206.01s -> 3206.83s]  What do I eat?
[3210.24s -> 3210.96s]  This is dangerous.
[3210.96s -> 3211.44s]  I don't know why.
[3211.44s -> 3212.96s]  I don't think anyone should do this.
[3212.96s -> 3215.42s]  Oh, we're fine.
[3215.42s -> 3216.83s]  Okay, give me the other turkey.
[3218.75s -> 3220.51s]  This time I'm not going to skin this one.
[3220.51s -> 3221.31s]  I'm going to bring this back to,
[3222.03s -> 3222.91s]  but I don't know what his name is.
[3223.71s -> 3231.90s]  Who's that?
[3231.90s -> 3236.75s]  Who's this guy?
[3236.99s -> 3238.27s]  Come on, boy.
[3238.27s -> 3242.70s]  You think I got a problem?
[3243.68s -> 3245.36s]  He ain't getting either one of these turkeys.
[3245.36s -> 3246.48s]  I'm guaranteeing you that.
[3247.04s -> 3258.48s]  How many turkeys can I put on one horse?
[3258.96s -> 3267.34s]  Get lost.
[3267.34s -> 3268.88s]  I'm all in mess with you.
[3268.88s -> 3269.92s]  I'm just messing with you.
[3273.26s -> 3274.22s]  I'm just messing with you, dude.
[3275.02s -> 3275.58s]  Like I...
[3275.58s -> 3282.41s]  Hey, move it.
[3282.41s -> 3283.21s]  Hold on, you can...
[3283.21s -> 3284.41s]  How do I rob him?
[3284.41s -> 3285.29s]  Calm it.
[3285.29s -> 3290.38s]  I'll shoot you like a sick-ass...
[3293.60s -> 3294.72s]  Oh, no, wait.
[3294.72s -> 3295.60s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3302.32s -> 3302.88s]  No, I didn't...
[3302.88s -> 3303.60s]  Just stop moving.
[3304.32s -> 3310.56s]  Where's it going?
[3310.56s -> 3311.36s]  G-E...
[3311.36s -> 3312.08s]  That guy.
[3312.08s -> 3313.20s]  Wait, that guy might have something.
[3313.84s -> 3316.08s]  Oh, there's a witness.
[3317.82s -> 3318.78s]  The horse is the witness?
[3319.42s -> 3320.54s]  It's this guy.
[3321.18s -> 3325.02s]  Stop.
[3325.02s -> 3325.42s]  Hands up.
[3326.06s -> 3328.12s]  Get your hands in the air.
[3331.55s -> 3331.87s]  Stop.
[3332.59s -> 3334.46s]  Stop it.
[3334.46s -> 3335.50s]  I don't want to have to do this.
[3336.22s -> 3340.78s]  Stop.
[3347.66s -> 3348.54s]  Stop moving.
[3360.33s -> 3360.97s]  Come on, now.
[3361.77s -> 3378.43s]  What do you have?
[3379.63s -> 3379.95s]  Hey.
[3380.75s -> 3384.28s]  All right, I gotta get rid of this guy.
[3384.92s -> 3389.44s]  Is this like Hitman?
[3390.00s -> 3392.36s]  Do I have to like bury him somewhere?
[3396.00s -> 3396.80s]  He's hidden in the...
[3396.80s -> 3397.84s]  He's hidden in the trees.
[3398.48s -> 3399.84s]  No more witnesses.
[3399.84s -> 3400.72s]  We're good.
[3400.72s -> 3406.84s]  What was he doing?
[3406.84s -> 3407.40s]  Oh, this way.
[3407.40s -> 3407.64s]  Okay.
[3410.96s -> 3412.24s]  You can't skin a person.
[3412.24s -> 3413.28s]  What are you talking about?
[3413.28s -> 3414.08s]  Wait, we're going this way.
[3424.99s -> 3428.99s]  You can't just like rob and kill every person.
[3431.40s -> 3432.60s]  There are turkeys over here anyways,
[3432.60s -> 3433.48s]  and that's what we care about.
[3435.39s -> 3441.45s]  Where'd they go up here?
[3441.45s -> 3445.72s]  I don't see anybody.
[3447.98s -> 3448.78s]  No, they got away.
[3448.78s -> 3449.26s]  That's okay.
[3453.90s -> 3454.30s]  Study.
[3454.30s -> 3455.26s]  Wait, I can study sheep?
[3456.46s -> 3459.61s]  Ooh.
[3459.61s -> 3461.21s]  Hold binoculars while looking at them.
[3472.09s -> 3473.13s]  I don't understand.
[3473.13s -> 3473.61s]  Does that work?
[3474.33s -> 3485.21s]  I don't think it worked.
[3488.17s -> 3488.73s]  Don't eat them?
[3489.53s -> 3490.57s]  What am I, the big bad wolf?
[3493.26s -> 3493.82s]  Okay, slow down.
[3493.82s -> 3494.14s]  No, no, no.
[3494.14s -> 3495.26s]  I'll get in trouble here.
[3497.66s -> 3499.66s]  Animals attached to your horse will decompose.
[3499.66s -> 3500.62s]  Sell them before this happens.
[3500.62s -> 3501.34s]  Oh, shit.
[3501.34s -> 3502.14s]  I need to sell these.
[3509.37s -> 3510.09s]  Study quick.
[3510.65s -> 3510.97s]  Come here.
[3510.97s -> 3511.21s]  Come here.
[3511.21s -> 3511.61s]  Come here.
[3511.61s -> 3511.85s]  No.
[3514.16s -> 3514.48s]  Got it.
[3519.50s -> 3520.46s]  All right, let's go.
[3523.44s -> 3525.84s]  That was a shot in the dark completely.
[3530.70s -> 3531.10s]  Made it.
[3531.82s -> 3535.21s]  I don't know how fast I can like full sprint over here though.
[3535.21s -> 3535.61s]  There we go.
[3535.61s -> 3536.01s]  We're good.
[3540.00s -> 3540.64s]  Pitch the horse.
[3543.00s -> 3544.44s]  Now we're at the general store.
[3545.56s -> 3547.87s]  I need the turkey.
[3547.87s -> 3548.27s]  Turkeys.
[3548.27s -> 3548.83s]  I need both.
[3548.83s -> 3549.47s]  I need a turkey.
[3550.27s -> 3550.59s]  Okay.
[3551.31s -> 3552.51s]  I got fresh turkeys here.
[3554.33s -> 3556.41s]  And I'm willing to sell it for a moderate price.
[3566.04s -> 3566.68s]  What?
[3566.68s -> 3568.76s]  Hey, what am I, what are you, what?
[3569.40s -> 3572.11s]  I'm trying to sell you a turkey, man.
[3572.11s -> 3573.07s]  Oh, don't do that.
[3573.07s -> 3574.19s]  I'll kick you out.
[3574.19s -> 3575.98s]  You can interact with the shopkeeper
[3575.98s -> 3576.86s]  by approaching the catalog.
[3581.26s -> 3582.06s]  What?
[3582.06s -> 3585.56s]  I just got kicked out for bringing a turkey?
[3586.52s -> 3589.79s]  Where's the butcher?
[3590.51s -> 3591.07s]  Pardon me.
[3593.18s -> 3593.82s]  God damn it.
[3593.82s -> 3594.14s]  Come here.
[3594.14s -> 3594.54s]  Let's go.
[3595.26s -> 3597.34s]  All right, here we go.
[3598.68s -> 3599.96s]  Hey, I got a...
[3600.68s -> 3602.19s]  You can interact with the shopkeeper.
[3602.19s -> 3602.83s]  All right, let's go.
[3602.83s -> 3603.95s]  I'm gonna throw it down on here.
[3604.59s -> 3606.80s]  I got some quality meat here.
[3611.53s -> 3612.89s]  All right, I don't, I,
[3612.89s -> 3614.01s]  I don't have to walk it over here.
[3614.01s -> 3614.25s]  Okay.
[3615.79s -> 3616.75s]  Sales of turkey meat.
[3617.47s -> 3621.07s]  Salted beef.
[3621.07s -> 3621.87s]  I'm gonna keep that.
[3624.80s -> 3625.52s]  Turkey feathers.
[3627.23s -> 3627.79s]  50 cents.
[3627.79s -> 3628.19s]  That's not bad.
[3628.19s -> 3628.67s]  That's pretty good.
[3631.40s -> 3634.17s]  To sell a pellet stored on the back of your horse,
[3634.17s -> 3635.45s]  take your horse close to the butcher.
[3635.45s -> 3636.33s]  Oh, I gotta get the horse.
[3641.39s -> 3641.71s]  Native.
[3642.35s -> 3643.32s]  All right, horse cargo.
[3643.32s -> 3644.44s]  What does he got on there?
[3644.44s -> 3646.67s]  Ooh, look at all this stuff.
[3648.76s -> 3649.72s]  I have so much shit here.
[3650.28s -> 3652.28s]  I got two championship belts.
[3655.36s -> 3656.56s]  I don't think I can sell any of these.
[3656.56s -> 3657.04s]  Maybe I can.
[3657.68s -> 3658.40s]  Time game?
[3659.12s -> 3661.15s]  I feel like I shouldn't sell these.
[3661.15s -> 3662.03s]  I'm probably gonna need them.
[3665.08s -> 3667.40s]  All right, let's go find Mr. G.E.
[3667.40s -> 3669.40s]  Glips indicate optional stranger missions.
[3669.40s -> 3670.28s]  Speak to the stranger.
[3672.54s -> 3673.34s]  Question mark, Glip.
[3673.98s -> 3677.39s]  Do you see, I don't see one of them.
[3677.39s -> 3678.91s]  Do you see a question mark, Glip?
[3679.55s -> 3684.73s]  I don't see one.
[3686.01s -> 3688.04s]  All right, let's just go.
[3688.04s -> 3688.76s]  Let's go find this guy.
[3689.66s -> 3690.78s]  I don't think he's in the store.
[3690.78s -> 3691.42s]  Probably down here.
[3692.22s -> 3693.74s]  I need new clothes.
[3694.46s -> 3695.26s]  I don't know.
[3695.26s -> 3695.98s]  I guess it is.
[3695.98s -> 3697.34s]  He's in this saloon.
[3706.92s -> 3709.40s]  The psycho in me just wants to throw a chair in here.
[3709.40s -> 3710.68s]  But I can't.
[3710.68s -> 3712.04s]  No, not yet.
[3725.80s -> 3728.36s]  Yes, he's a pussy cat.
[3728.36s -> 3729.80s]  Ain't that so, Arthur?
[3729.80s -> 3730.60s]  Whatever you say.
[3731.48s -> 3733.00s]  How much you cost, anyway?
[3733.00s -> 3735.56s]  Ain't that a nice way to talk to a lady?
[3735.56s -> 3737.96s]  Oh, I didn't know I was talking to a lady.
[3738.52s -> 3739.16s]  Excuse me.
[3741.48s -> 3743.16s]  Well, I must say,
[3743.96s -> 3745.96s]  you got a fine way with the women, amigo.
[3745.96s -> 3748.65s]  They're dandy and a charm.
[3749.37s -> 3750.09s]  What's in there?
[3750.09s -> 3750.65s]  Chocolate milk?
[3750.65s -> 3751.77s]  Oh, man.
[3751.77s -> 3753.05s]  I dread to think about it.
[3757.34s -> 3758.86s]  Hey, you motherfucker.
[3762.35s -> 3763.15s]  Barroom brawl.
[3763.15s -> 3764.03s]  This is where it starts.
[3764.83s -> 3770.08s]  This is what you came for.
[3775.44s -> 3777.36s]  This is for me to get my ass kicked.
[3778.08s -> 3784.09s]  What do you got?
[3784.09s -> 3785.47s]  Oh, what's that?
[3785.47s -> 3786.43s]  You just got dodged?
[3789.88s -> 3790.68s]  How do I pick up a chair?
[3791.24s -> 3792.12s]  Come on.
[3792.12s -> 3793.64s]  There's going to be something I can do here.
[3793.64s -> 3797.68s]  Wait, who's that?
[3800.30s -> 3801.18s]  Who is that guy?
[3801.18s -> 3802.14s]  Uh-oh, here's the boss.
[3808.83s -> 3809.63s]  Uh-oh, a chair.
[3814.94s -> 3817.50s]  Can I rip off the gas line and just throw a match in here?
[3818.22s -> 3822.19s]  Nice.
[3823.71s -> 3824.11s]  Pick up.
[3826.86s -> 3828.14s]  No, I want the hat.
[3828.14s -> 3828.78s]  I want the chair.
[3828.78s -> 3834.40s]  Hello?
[3835.47s -> 3835.87s]  Hello?
[3836.51s -> 3842.83s]  Oh, didn't even break the table.
[3843.47s -> 3844.41s]  Come on, man.
[3851.56s -> 3852.04s]  Let's go.
[3856.19s -> 3857.07s]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3857.07s -> 3858.03s]  Ear grab.
[3858.03s -> 3858.75s]  That's not cool.
[3859.63s -> 3876.57s]  Oh, he's bigger than me.
[3877.13s -> 3883.16s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3883.16s -> 3883.72s]  Scripted.
[3883.72s -> 3884.28s]  Scripted.
[3885.08s -> 3885.56s]  Scripted.
[3886.20s -> 3893.31s]  He blocked everything.
[3904.49s -> 3915.58s]  Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.
[3916.38s -> 3921.23s]  All right, am I missing something from the tutorial five days ago?
[3922.43s -> 3924.03s]  Wait, am I not doing something right here?
[3926.27s -> 3927.79s]  I think you hold the block.
[3927.79s -> 3928.91s]  You can dodge, too, can't you?
[3929.71s -> 3944.32s]  Counter attack.
[3944.32s -> 3948.64s]  So you hold square and then hit left or right right before he swings, right?
[3949.76s -> 3952.40s]  Remember, I did the first half of this tutorial five days ago.
[3953.68s -> 3954.72s]  I haven't turned it on since.
[3955.36s -> 3963.48s]  Just pressing the direction while holding the block.
[3967.61s -> 3968.49s]  Save the goatee?
[3968.49s -> 3968.73s]  No.
[3975.15s -> 3978.91s]  I'm going to not shower for the rest of the game.
[3982.04s -> 3983.40s]  Can I stay like this forever?
[3985.80s -> 3987.72s]  Can I just be the guy that got slimed the whole game?
[4009.93s -> 4011.61s]  Come on, it seems.
[4011.61s -> 4013.45s]  Tom, you found him.
[4013.45s -> 4015.13s]  Yes, I have.
[4015.13s -> 4018.01s]  He's being held by some bounty hunters,
[4018.01s -> 4021.77s]  trying to see how much money the government will pay them.
[4021.77s -> 4025.53s]  I know he's in Blackwater, but there's talk of them moving.
[4026.41s -> 4027.13s]  We'll get a second here.
[4027.13s -> 4028.81s]  I'm going to update you guys on the green screen.
[4033.64s -> 4034.60s]  We've been live for about an hour.
[4034.60s -> 4036.04s]  There'll be breakertons all over the place.
[4036.04s -> 4037.88s]  But if he's alive, we've got to try.
[4037.88s -> 4038.84s]  Updates on how that's going to happen.
[4038.84s -> 4039.40s]  Yeah, of course.
[4040.12s -> 4041.88s]  It's you they want, Dutch.
[4041.88s -> 4042.84s]  Always is.
[4043.88s -> 4046.36s]  Charles, go find out what you can.
[4046.36s -> 4047.24s]  Carefully.
[4047.24s -> 4049.40s]  Josiah, take Javier.
[4049.40s -> 4052.20s]  Arthur, go get yourself cleaned up.
[4052.20s -> 4053.48s]  Join them when you're ready.
[4054.04s -> 4055.00s]  What about me?
[4056.83s -> 4057.79s]  Well, exactly.
[4057.79s -> 4058.67s]  What about you?
[4059.23s -> 4060.19s]  What does that mean?
[4063.31s -> 4064.19s]  Oh no, never mind.
[4071.63s -> 4073.95s]  Okay, so let's talk for a second.
[4075.15s -> 4077.07s]  So if you missed the stream,
[4077.07s -> 4078.91s]  let me just put the camera on because we're here.
[4079.71s -> 4082.35s]  If you missed the stream from three or four days ago or so,
[4083.47s -> 4085.95s]  my plan was because we were having a bunch of internet problems,
[4085.95s -> 4087.31s]  and we still are.
[4087.31s -> 4088.59s]  It's not completely fixed yet.
[4089.31s -> 4092.27s]  So wait, is this my my desync here?
[4093.15s -> 4093.88s]  I might be.
[4106.27s -> 4107.47s]  Let me sync this up.
[4108.03s -> 4118.22s]  All right.
[4119.18s -> 4121.80s]  Come on out here thing.
[4121.80s -> 4122.28s]  There we go.
[4123.16s -> 4128.14s]  All right, so because the beard's growing,
[4130.49s -> 4131.53s]  I haven't had time to shave.
[4134.60s -> 4135.48s]  That should be good now.
[4136.04s -> 4138.84s]  But anyways, because of the internet problems,
[4138.84s -> 4141.00s]  my plan was if we didn't get it back,
[4141.00s -> 4144.44s]  I was going to desperately try to get the green screen stream done like tomorrow.
[4144.44s -> 4148.44s]  But now that they're actually working on the infrastructural problems
[4148.44s -> 4149.56s]  that were in this area,
[4150.68s -> 4153.32s]  I think I'll be able to stream now.
[4153.32s -> 4156.04s]  I don't quote me on that, but like I did just say it.
[4157.16s -> 4158.44s]  This has been green here for a while.
[4158.44s -> 4159.24s]  No drop frames.
[4159.24s -> 4160.52s]  It's looking all right for now.
[4161.48s -> 4164.20s]  So the green screen stream,
[4164.20s -> 4165.32s]  if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[4165.32s -> 4167.48s]  I'm going to get in front of a green screen for like an hour or two.
[4167.48s -> 4171.56s]  And I'm going to do a bunch of actions that you guys ask for and that we vote on.
[4172.20s -> 4173.96s]  But here's how I'm changing it though.
[4174.52s -> 4176.36s]  Because I'm including props,
[4177.34s -> 4180.38s]  you know, I'm only going to we're going to set it up probably in a couple of sections.
[4180.38s -> 4183.66s]  Like you'll be voting for props, you know, prop actions.
[4183.66s -> 4188.94s]  You'll be voting for regular actions because every prop action will just win.
[4189.02s -> 4193.26s]  And I'll have to spend like five grand on like two day Amazon stuff.
[4193.90s -> 4197.50s]  So we're definitely we're definitely going to have to split it off into different sections.
[4197.50s -> 4199.18s]  So you have to vote for your favorite one.
[4201.28s -> 4202.32s]  This is such a good idea.
[4202.32s -> 4203.44s]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[4204.08s -> 4206.16s]  So we're not doing that like tomorrow
[4206.16s -> 4208.88s]  because I need some more time to go through and section these off.
[4208.88s -> 4212.80s]  And I'm going to present in the discord a series of polls.
[4213.36s -> 4214.72s]  We're going to vote on them.
[4214.72s -> 4218.88s]  This is not I'm going to I'm going to try to get this done from tonight into tomorrow.
[4218.88s -> 4222.48s]  And I'd say by this weekend you'll have a poll to vote on.
[4222.48s -> 4224.48s]  But with three different sections in it.
[4224.48s -> 4230.08s]  And then I'll be streaming periodically hopefully if the internet stays fine.
[4231.04s -> 4234.00s]  Expect now that the streams are able to happen from here.
[4234.56s -> 4237.60s]  We'll push this forward a little bit so people have time to participate.
[4238.56s -> 4242.08s]  And we'll get that stream probably going next week.
[4242.08s -> 4244.08s]  Like probably like six or seven days from right now.
[4245.61s -> 4248.73s]  I have a studio that I'm currently in contact with
[4248.73s -> 4250.73s]  and working with so it is that it's happening.
[4250.73s -> 4252.73s]  We just need some more time to get it prepared.
[4253.37s -> 4255.34s]  Because I know I'm going to need to buy props.
[4255.34s -> 4257.34s]  And that's going to take at least two days to get that stuff here.
[4258.30s -> 4260.70s]  So now hopefully that's a decent update.
[4260.70s -> 4262.54s]  It's no longer a secret anymore by the way.
[4262.54s -> 4264.70s]  Because I need to know what props I have to get.
[4265.58s -> 4267.98s]  So that this is the whole secret thing.
[4267.98s -> 4270.94s]  Like I'm not going to know is that's not happening anymore.
[4270.94s -> 4273.34s]  So I'll be in there browsing and perusing.
[4273.34s -> 4275.18s]  And JabbaDab just gave five more subs.
[4276.00s -> 4277.52s]  Five community subs from JabbaDab.
[4278.08s -> 4280.81s]  Thank you.
[4280.89s -> 4282.41s]  Can't you just paint one of your rooms green?
[4282.41s -> 4283.45s]  Oh I mean well I could.
[4284.01s -> 4285.45s]  But you have to remember something.
[4285.45s -> 4288.25s]  A green screen studio is like 50 feet up and down.
[4288.89s -> 4292.89s]  If I were to paint a room back here it would just be like by...
[4293.53s -> 4298.01s]  It would be impossible to do let's say me sprinting and sliding into home base.
[4298.01s -> 4299.29s]  I wouldn't be able to do that.
[4300.09s -> 4305.05s]  With an actual studio I'll be able to do large scale movements.
[4305.05s -> 4306.97s]  Full body, feet, everything.
[4306.97s -> 4307.77s]  It will be keyed out.
[4309.16s -> 4309.80s]  And thank...
[4309.80s -> 4312.20s]  Kazzy101 just gave five community subs here.
[4312.20s -> 4312.52s]  Thank you.
[4314.86s -> 4315.74s]  Here's another one.
[4317.88s -> 4318.92s]  Thank you so much guys.
[4318.92s -> 4319.56s]  Both of you.
[4319.56s -> 4320.28s]  Five in a row here.
[4320.28s -> 4320.84s]  Five in a row.
[4322.81s -> 4325.21s]  Yeah so like you'll be able to see full body,
[4325.21s -> 4328.09s]  complete green over like a 40 or 50 foot space.
[4328.97s -> 4330.49s]  It professionally lit.
[4330.49s -> 4331.77s]  It'll be perfect.
[4333.08s -> 4335.32s]  Because you either go hard or go home with this.
[4335.32s -> 4335.88s]  You know what I'm saying?
[4335.88s -> 4338.60s]  Like I don't want to put like just a green screen behind me and like
[4338.60s -> 4339.88s]  do five Fortnite dances.
[4339.88s -> 4340.92s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[4341.00s -> 4344.36s]  Like there's gonna be a lot of shit that I'm gonna do in front of this camera.
[4346.24s -> 4349.28s]  But regardless that's kind of the update with that situation.
[4349.28s -> 4350.64s]  We're gonna do that probably next week.
[4351.36s -> 4353.68s]  Give some more time to get more suggestions
[4353.68s -> 4354.96s]  and for me to make some polls
[4354.96s -> 4358.40s]  and you will hear about it again over the coming couple of days.
[4358.40s -> 4359.28s]  Here we go.
[4359.28s -> 4363.53s]  Okay back to John Marston or no Arthur.
[4364.41s -> 4366.01s]  All right multiple missions are available in the camp.
[4366.01s -> 4367.93s]  These are shown as the that thing.
[4369.52s -> 4370.80s]  All right I need to take...
[4370.80s -> 4371.68s]  Maybe I should take a bath.
[4372.40s -> 4376.84s]  Can we have a peek at the recommendations?
[4376.84s -> 4378.04s]  You can go look at it right now.
[4378.04s -> 4378.84s]  You got your act together.
[4378.84s -> 4382.04s]  There's a channel in the discord that is...

[5417.24s -> 5429.48s]  Down here.
[5432.17s -> 5433.29s]  No you can't get down that.
[5434.62s -> 5435.26s]  No he can't.
[5435.90s -> 5436.70s]  Pitch the horse.
[5438.17s -> 5440.17s]  Don't kick me backwards please.
[5440.17s -> 5440.73s]  You're fine.
[5441.45s -> 5442.09s]  I'm gonna pet him.
[5442.81s -> 5444.38s]  He's fine.
[5448.17s -> 5449.61s]  There's the path I want to go.
[5449.77s -> 5450.17s]  Right here.
[5465.45s -> 5466.01s]  He's all right.
[5471.79s -> 5473.55s]  I didn't know that was gonna be that far drop.
[5479.53s -> 5480.89s]  Special horse reviver.
[5482.44s -> 5483.16s]  Okay let's go.
[5488.28s -> 5489.56s]  I'm gonna just trot for a second.
[5490.36s -> 5496.08s]  Although can I kind of make like a waypoint?
[5496.08s -> 5497.68s]  Do those do those exist?
[5497.68s -> 5498.72s]  I'm so far away.
[5502.46s -> 5504.14s]  I'm all the way down here.
[5504.14s -> 5505.26s]  Holy shit.
[5505.26s -> 5506.78s]  What the hell was I doing all the way up there?
[5520.52s -> 5521.88s]  Out of options eat the horse.
[5523.90s -> 5524.54s]  Fast travel?
[5524.78s -> 5525.90s]  Should I fast travel or should I run?
[5529.10s -> 5529.74s]  Feed the horse?
[5530.46s -> 5534.40s]  Christ.
[5534.40s -> 5535.84s]  All right what does horse break?
[5536.64s -> 5540.43s]  Is it like square?
[5540.43s -> 5541.63s]  Like how do you slow down?
[5543.28s -> 5543.84s]  Arb one.
[5543.84s -> 5544.34s]  Okay.
[5547.13s -> 5548.41s]  I think those are bad guys by the way.
[5548.41s -> 5549.69s]  Horses dirty and causes health.
[5549.69s -> 5551.13s]  You gotta brush your horse or ride it through water.
[5551.13s -> 5554.48s]  Here we go.
[5554.48s -> 5555.12s]  Helpful all right.
[5555.84s -> 5556.96s]  I'm gonna brush him.
[5559.36s -> 5562.81s]  Sorry pet him.
[5563.37s -> 5564.73s]  He's nicely clean.
[5568.06s -> 5569.18s]  Robbery in progress.
[5569.90s -> 5579.21s]  Is a bleeding animal on its back?
[5580.09s -> 5580.94s]  Oh fuck.
[5599.61s -> 5600.25s]  What the fuck?
[5605.26s -> 5608.57s]  All right now how do I?
[5608.57s -> 5609.77s]  Can I like take everything?
[5617.42s -> 5618.22s]  Satchel's full.
[5623.00s -> 5623.88s]  Kind of wedding ring.
[5630.52s -> 5631.16s]  Hold on.
[5631.16s -> 5633.04s]  Two chewing tobacco.
[5633.04s -> 5633.68s]  Does this guy have a gun?
[5641.26s -> 5642.94s]  Maintain guys.
[5642.94s -> 5643.42s]  Hold on.
[5643.42s -> 5643.82s]  Pick up.
[5645.02s -> 5645.98s]  Carbine repeater.
[5646.70s -> 5650.67s]  Open eyes provide half the benefits of new items.
[5651.47s -> 5655.02s]  Should I just leave these guys here?
[5655.18s -> 5657.77s]  Can I go in the back of this?
[5662.89s -> 5677.68s]  And I just take seven repeater cartridges.
[5678.72s -> 5679.52s]  Revolver cartridges.
[5683.07s -> 5683.79s]  Baked beans.
[5686.06s -> 5686.78s]  Is that it?
[5689.21s -> 5690.01s]  Why am I doing this?
[5692.59s -> 5694.89s]  Why can't I just go in like a normal person?
[5695.53s -> 5697.20s]  Just go in.
[5697.20s -> 5698.88s]  Why do you have the Spider-Man around this?
[5698.88s -> 5699.68s]  Just go in.
[5701.92s -> 5703.52s]  What is the ground poison?
[5703.52s -> 5704.40s]  I don't understand.
[5704.40s -> 5704.96s]  Get in there.
[5705.76s -> 5706.88s]  All right this is mine now.
[5716.43s -> 5732.12s]  Santa got his sleigh.
[5732.84s -> 5737.36s]  I can, can I sell this?
[5737.36s -> 5738.64s]  What the hell is going on here?
[5738.64s -> 5739.28s]  What happened?
[5739.28s -> 5742.08s]  I'm just getting attacked by a random...
[5742.08s -> 5745.40s]  Come on horse, let's go.
[5745.40s -> 5746.20s]  Is he coming?
[5746.20s -> 5754.46s]  He's going?
[5754.46s -> 5764.67s]  Wait, okay, I thought that was a guy running.
[5764.67s -> 5767.31s]  I need to eat something.
[5767.31s -> 5768.43s]  What do we got?
[5768.43s -> 5773.13s]  Dead Eye Tonic Baked Beans.
[5774.48s -> 5775.76s]  Can I throw it to the horses?
[5778.86s -> 5779.90s]  Turn off the fan?
[5779.90s -> 5787.52s]  What the, the PlayStation 4 fan?
[5788.72s -> 5789.52s]  That's impossible.
[5790.80s -> 5792.60s]  That's the thing.
[5792.60s -> 5793.40s]  That's impossible.
[5796.16s -> 5802.43s]  That's the PS4 just churning right now.
[5802.43s -> 5804.27s]  I gotta turn off the PS4 fan.
[5809.77s -> 5811.21s]  Just turn off the PS4.
[5811.21s -> 5811.93s]  What are you waiting for?
[5825.93s -> 5826.41s]  Who's this?
[5827.05s -> 5829.18s]  I mean, who's there?
[5831.93s -> 5832.41s]  What are you doing?
[5832.41s -> 5832.97s]  What's happening?
[5835.20s -> 5835.76s]  I'm here.
[5835.76s -> 5836.26s]  What?
[5840.48s -> 5841.76s]  Everything wagons to the camp.
[5841.76s -> 5843.20s]  They'll be available again when you leave.
[5844.00s -> 5846.67s]  Oh, well, I can't bring that in here.
[5849.61s -> 5851.93s]  I still got my, my fox corpus.
[5852.65s -> 5861.13s]  Where, hey, can I talk to him?
[5869.96s -> 5870.92s]  Camp funds, 30 bucks.
[5870.92s -> 5872.28s]  Yeah, you left me to deal with the big guy.
[5875.08s -> 5879.20s]  Drive the wagon off.
[5879.20s -> 5881.36s]  Don't give me ideas like that, man.
[5881.36s -> 5883.84s]  I will derail this whole stream for an hour and a half.
[5891.90s -> 5892.86s]  And I'm dirty, too.
[5892.86s -> 5894.78s]  I got my new Santa suit dirty.
[5895.42s -> 5902.43s]  I can't even get on it.
[5906.51s -> 5909.76s]  They won't let me get on anymore.
[5909.76s -> 5910.80s]  They took it away from me.
[5923.02s -> 5925.50s]  Red's not a Christmas color.
[5926.89s -> 5927.69s]  What?
[5928.41s -> 5929.45s]  Santa is red.
[5930.41s -> 5930.91s]  What?
[5931.77s -> 5933.13s]  He's a big red guy.
[5938.89s -> 5940.09s]  I've read that wrong.
[5940.09s -> 5940.59s]  I did?
[5941.61s -> 5947.29s]  Bring him animal supplies to the camp.
[5947.29s -> 5949.45s]  We can use the meat for food and skins to craft satchels.
[5949.45s -> 5950.01s]  All right.
[5950.01s -> 5950.97s]  Let me, hold on a second.
[5951.61s -> 5953.85s]  Let's go to the butcher.
[5953.85s -> 5955.85s]  I want to, where's my, okay, I got my wolf, right?
[5955.85s -> 5956.97s]  He's still stowed.
[5956.97s -> 5958.09s]  So then he should show up, right?
[5958.97s -> 5964.41s]  I'm going to actually give some real money here.
[5968.60s -> 5969.56s]  I'm going to donate some money.
[5974.12s -> 5976.20s]  They said it is a, okay, give item.
[5977.72s -> 5978.76s]  Ooh, watches.
[5978.76s -> 5980.28s]  No, well, these are worth a lot of money.
[5983.10s -> 5983.42s]  All right.
[5983.42s -> 5984.94s]  I'll give one clamp.
[5985.58s -> 5986.22s]  Buckle.
[5986.22s -> 5991.13s]  All right.
[5991.13s -> 5992.01s]  That's fine.
[5992.01s -> 5994.89s]  Well, they only, I have more money than the whole camp combined.
[5994.89s -> 5996.33s]  That's not, that's not okay.
[6000.76s -> 6001.08s]  All right.
[6001.08s -> 6001.88s]  I'm going to give some money.
[6002.68s -> 6004.68s]  What do I get?
[6004.68s -> 6005.40s]  88 bucks.
[6008.75s -> 6009.55s]  I'm going to give $10.
[6010.51s -> 6011.95s]  No, I'll get $15.
[6015.28s -> 6015.78s]  $16.
[6017.20s -> 6018.16s]  That's got to be worth something.
[6023.82s -> 6024.46s]  Go to the butcher.
[6027.87s -> 6029.23s]  Thank you for the 1600.
[6029.23s -> 6029.55s]  All right.
[6029.55s -> 6030.05s]  Donate.
[6032.00s -> 6034.24s]  We could really use some more meat, Mr. Morgan.
[6034.56s -> 6035.06s]  Okay.
[6035.44s -> 6037.40s]  Provisions, the coyote meat.
[6038.68s -> 6040.06s]  Let me see.
[6040.60s -> 6045.13s]  Coyote pelt and some meat.
[6045.13s -> 6046.73s]  Well, I'll take what I can get.
[6046.73s -> 6047.23s]  Okay.
[6048.12s -> 6049.40s]  Many thanks, Mr. Morgan.
[6049.40s -> 6050.12s]  So let me see.
[6050.12s -> 6051.72s]  What do I need to do to upgrade my satchel?
[6051.72s -> 6052.44s]  My satchel sucks.
[6052.44s -> 6054.68s]  I'm more than happy to craft you something if you bring me the right materials.
[6055.24s -> 6055.72s]  Okay.
[6055.72s -> 6059.08s]  I need to purchase leather working tools and upgrade the medicine wagon.
[6059.88s -> 6062.81s]  So I need leather working tools.
[6063.61s -> 6066.17s]  And then donate five animal carcasses to Pearson.
[6072.27s -> 6073.79s]  So I need to buy leather working tools.
[6074.51s -> 6077.02s]  Where the hell do I get those?
[6077.02s -> 6080.70s]  I reckon I'm going to think about it.
[6080.70s -> 6082.72s]  Where am I supposed to get that shit?
[6086.48s -> 6086.98s]  All right.
[6088.17s -> 6089.13s]  I can eat from the soup, right?
[6089.13s -> 6090.33s]  Because I get one soup a day.
[6091.05s -> 6095.61s]  All good.
[6095.61s -> 6099.21s]  But what if, well, what if I want an extra serving?
[6102.17s -> 6102.81s]  It's not allowed.
[6102.81s -> 6103.05s]  Okay.
[6103.05s -> 6104.49s]  Well, we've got a mission right here.
[6104.49s -> 6105.77s]  This guy's like tied to a tree.
[6105.77s -> 6106.49s]  Let's see what his problem is.
[6106.49s -> 6107.45s]  What's this going to end?
[6112.97s -> 6113.47s]  Speak.
[6114.01s -> 6115.60s]  Don't cry, boy.
[6115.60s -> 6117.36s]  Speak about your gang.
[6121.69s -> 6125.61s]  I can't.
[6125.61s -> 6127.13s]  I have to beat this guy up tied to a tree.
[6127.13s -> 6127.85s]  Boy.
[6127.85s -> 6128.57s]  Whoa.
[6128.57s -> 6129.80s]  Horses there.
[6129.80s -> 6130.30s]  Whoa.
[6130.30s -> 6133.80s]  It seems the cat has got our friend here's tongue.
[6133.80s -> 6136.20s]  I was thinking Mr. Williamson could have a word.
[6136.20s -> 6137.56s]  Be ready to talk, boy.
[6137.56s -> 6138.52s]  I told you, mister.
[6138.52s -> 6139.48s]  I told all of you.
[6139.48s -> 6141.00s]  H1 and his chief.
[6141.00s -> 6142.60s]  They ain't no friends of mine.
[6142.60s -> 6144.28s]  I've just been ridding with them for a while.
[6144.28s -> 6145.08s]  Horseshit.
[6145.08s -> 6146.60s]  You see, we heard that part.
[6146.60s -> 6148.44s]  So how about you tell the truth?
[6148.44s -> 6149.72s]  That's what you want me to do.
[6149.72s -> 6150.44s]  Heard him.
[6150.44s -> 6152.44s]  So the next time he opens his mouth,
[6152.44s -> 6154.36s]  it is to tell us what is going on.
[6155.72s -> 6156.44s]  Who am I kidding?
[6157.08s -> 6159.56s]  One old Driscoll's boys couldn't open his mouth,
[6159.56s -> 6160.68s]  but he'd tell a lie.
[6162.09s -> 6163.21s]  Screw it.
[6163.21s -> 6165.45s]  Let's just have some fun.
[6165.45s -> 6167.29s]  Well, why don't you carve out his brain?
[6168.09s -> 6168.81s]  Eat his brain.
[6168.81s -> 6169.45s]  What's he doing?
[6169.45s -> 6169.77s]  Where's he going?
[6169.77s -> 6171.21s]  And then close your eyes and sleep
[6171.21s -> 6172.41s]  and see if while you're digesting it,
[6172.41s -> 6173.29s]  you can hear his thoughts.
[6175.05s -> 6176.41s]  It's not a bad idea, I don't think.
[6177.13s -> 6180.86s]  You know, an imperial mix was among the happiest
[6180.86s -> 6182.54s]  and most loyal of courtiers.
[6182.54s -> 6183.74s]  Are you kidding me, right?
[6183.74s -> 6184.38s]  Of course.
[6184.38s -> 6185.58s]  You sick bastards!
[6186.94s -> 6187.98s]  What are we doing here?
[6187.98s -> 6189.74s]  Well, you are going to talk.
[6189.74s -> 6192.70s]  The only question is now or later
[6192.70s -> 6194.62s]  we got these little fellas off.
[6194.62s -> 6196.62s]  OK, listen.
[6196.62s -> 6198.86s]  I know where old Driscoll was holed up.
[6198.86s -> 6199.42s]  And you're right.
[6200.06s -> 6203.02s]  He don't like you any more than you like him.
[6203.02s -> 6204.70s]  He's at Six Point Cabin.
[6205.50s -> 6207.20s]  I'll take you there.
[6207.20s -> 6208.08s]  Serious.
[6208.08s -> 6209.44s]  I don't like him.
[6209.44s -> 6211.52s]  I mean, I like him even less than I like you.
[6212.80s -> 6213.84s]  None taken.
[6213.84s -> 6214.88s]  OK, then, partner.
[6215.84s -> 6217.68s]  Why don't you take a few of us up there?
[6219.72s -> 6220.60s]  I got this, Dutch.
[6221.24s -> 6222.20s]  Should be fun.
[6222.20s -> 6223.72s]  I was going for Santa and I ended up
[6223.72s -> 6225.00s]  as like Willy Wonka.
[6226.70s -> 6227.20s]  Somehow.
[6237.04s -> 6237.60s]  What did I get?
[6240.43s -> 6241.71s]  Wild West Wonka.
[6242.43s -> 6243.31s]  All right, throwing knife.
[6243.31s -> 6244.59s]  A small knife with a straight blade
[6244.59s -> 6245.23s]  designed in balance
[6245.23s -> 6246.35s]  so they can be thrown with ease
[6246.35s -> 6247.39s]  can be used to silently take down
[6247.39s -> 6248.59s]  any of the range
[6248.59s -> 6250.19s]  or use as a melee weapon if required.
[6250.19s -> 6251.39s]  It can be purchased from some less
[6251.39s -> 6252.91s]  than reputable sellers to save a trip
[6253.63s -> 6255.55s]  by recollecting the knife after throwing.
[6261.58s -> 6264.48s]  OK, come here.
[6264.48s -> 6266.91s]  We got a social call needs making.
[6267.71s -> 6268.75s]  Where are we heading?
[6268.75s -> 6270.96s]  I'm sitting down for Santa and underwear.
[6272.40s -> 6273.20s]  What are you talking about?
[6274.08s -> 6275.44s]  John, you take this little rascal.
[6275.44s -> 6276.64s]  I mean, like, what are you talking about?
[6276.64s -> 6278.32s]  Any nonsense, kill him.
[6280.16s -> 6280.96s]  Mount your horse.
[6284.65s -> 6285.21s]  OK, horse.
[6285.93s -> 6286.81s]  Let me pet you first.
[6288.17s -> 6298.04s]  Good boy.
[6298.04s -> 6299.48s]  OK, let's back it up.
[6299.48s -> 6305.40s]  I'm breaking things already.
[6306.44s -> 6308.04s]  I don't understand.
[6308.04s -> 6310.60s]  I just tried to move out of the fucking way.
[6312.52s -> 6314.81s]  All right, let me get.
[6315.37s -> 6316.97s]  How many knives do I have?
[6316.97s -> 6317.47s]  Just one.
[6321.02s -> 6322.27s]  Beat that up.
[6342.14s -> 6347.66s]  Telling you about Willy Wonka.
[6347.66s -> 6350.54s]  He's our man somewhere.
[6350.54s -> 6351.98s]  Hoping the opportunity comes
[6351.98s -> 6354.62s]  up to mention it last goddamn thing.
[6354.62s -> 6355.74s]  We was fucking terrible.
[6356.22s -> 6361.04s]  Hey, if I got my rings, it's over here.
[6362.73s -> 6365.79s]  Yeah, country.
[6365.79s -> 6367.63s]  Take this track up through the rocks.
[6370.44s -> 6370.84s]  No, no, no.
[6370.84s -> 6372.20s]  The Gene Wilder.
[6372.20s -> 6373.32s]  Willy Wonka was good.
[6373.32s -> 6381.93s]  But Johnny, they're talking like this.
[6381.93s -> 6383.61s]  The whole movie was kind of like, I don't know why.
[6385.29s -> 6386.97s]  I think the chewing gum is disgusting.
[6386.97s -> 6390.16s]  And I guess you're good here.
[6390.16s -> 6393.29s]  Unless some soft-handed feller comes along
[6393.29s -> 6395.21s]  and tells you you've gone too far.
[6396.01s -> 6397.29s]  What are you talking about?
[6399.05s -> 6400.01s]  Watch that whole movie.
[6400.01s -> 6403.77s]  It's just that you think beating the man to death
[6407.20s -> 6409.52s]  when we supposed to be laying low.
[6409.77s -> 6411.45s]  I saw your eyes, Morgan.
[6412.33s -> 6413.61s]  You didn't go clever.
[6413.61s -> 6414.65s]  You went soft.
[6422.09s -> 6423.05s]  That's how you talk.
[6423.77s -> 6424.17s]  Excuse me.
[6424.17s -> 6425.45s]  This is how I'm talking right now.
[6426.97s -> 6427.85s]  Do you hear this?
[6430.40s -> 6431.20s]  Does this sound?
[6433.18s -> 6434.94s]  Do you think I sound like that?
[6434.94s -> 6436.06s]  You're listening to me right now?
[6440.33s -> 6440.83s]  Yes.
[6443.85s -> 6444.89s]  That's what you hear.
[6445.61s -> 6452.19s]  You sound just like Johnny Depp.
[6454.88s -> 6457.18s]  All right.
[6457.18s -> 6457.74s]  Speed it up.
[6458.38s -> 6461.24s]  This guy moves a muscle.
[6462.12s -> 6462.52s]  Brain.
[6465.48s -> 6466.04s]  You know what I mean?
[6468.92s -> 6470.92s]  Hot knife through butter, through brain.
[6483.15s -> 6488.06s]  Maybe I know more about you than you know about them.
[6488.06s -> 6489.82s]  So tell us then.
[6492.64s -> 6493.52s]  Brain through butter.
[6493.52s -> 6494.56s]  You're outlawed like them.
[6494.56s -> 6505.87s]  About to survive like you live rough fighting the law.
[6505.87s -> 6507.63s]  I'm trying to fuck this up.
[6507.63s -> 6508.35s]  Get back up there.
[6517.04s -> 6518.72s]  You're already too close, man.
[6518.72s -> 6520.56s]  Dutch is more like a teacher.
[6520.56s -> 6524.00s]  From where I've been, you just look the same as all.
[6524.00s -> 6525.76s]  Then you looked, but you ain't seen.
[6527.74s -> 6529.18s]  Shut that boy up.
[6529.18s -> 6529.82s]  There we go.
[6529.82s -> 6530.30s]  Shut him up.
[6531.02s -> 6533.18s]  Does it like road rash, this guy?
[6533.18s -> 6534.70s]  We're almost on him.
[6534.70s -> 6541.48s]  Those of this son of a bitch we got with us is talking true.
[6541.48s -> 6545.96s]  But if it's what he says it is, and Cole Modrisko's here,
[6547.08s -> 6551.16s]  we can end years of fighting here and now.
[6551.16s -> 6552.28s]  Okay, now cut.
[6552.28s -> 6553.24s]  Skid turds?
[6554.04s -> 6554.20s]  What?
[6554.20s -> 6554.68s]  No, no.
[6558.46s -> 6560.86s]  Hold R1 and X while moving.
[6565.10s -> 6566.38s]  Why did I go right through that?
[6567.02s -> 6567.42s]  Hold on.
[6567.42s -> 6567.66s]  Wait, wait.
[6567.66s -> 6568.14s]  I've unlocked.
[6568.14s -> 6568.46s]  Hold on.
[6571.02s -> 6572.70s]  There we go.
[6572.70s -> 6575.82s]  So if you hold R1, he's going to move around.
[6576.86s -> 6577.50s]  It's a handbrake.
[6584.96s -> 6586.72s]  I wish I had that an hour ago.
[6586.72s -> 6587.60s]  Good thing I unlocked it.
[6595.84s -> 6596.56s]  It's an ambush.
[6596.56s -> 6596.96s]  Look out.
[6596.96s -> 6597.36s]  Oh, no.
[6598.72s -> 6608.62s]  Okay.
[6608.62s -> 6610.68s]  I got my knife out.
[6610.68s -> 6611.88s]  Who am I going to have to throw this at?
[6613.24s -> 6615.08s]  Just the other side of this hill.
[6615.08s -> 6615.40s]  Okay.
[6616.20s -> 6617.56s]  Off your horses.
[6617.56s -> 6619.32s]  The console is on PS4.
[6619.32s -> 6621.08s]  You're going to get them knives.
[6621.08s -> 6622.44s]  I said easy.
[6625.96s -> 6627.16s]  Off the horses, got the knife.
[6629.04s -> 6629.60s]  First person.
[6629.60s -> 6630.08s]  Follow me.
[6630.08s -> 6630.72s]  All right.
[6630.72s -> 6631.84s]  It ain't far.
[6631.84s -> 6635.12s]  We might have shared a horse, but we ain't friends.
[6635.12s -> 6636.92s]  Remember, watching you.
[6637.80s -> 6642.96s]  Every one guy.
[6642.96s -> 6644.64s]  Well, that's interesting, isn't it?
[6645.44s -> 6656.32s]  How do I throw?
[6658.80s -> 6660.16s]  Is this not throwing a knife?
[6660.16s -> 6660.72s]  Hold on.
[6660.72s -> 6669.55s]  Is this not throwing a knife?
[6670.75s -> 6672.67s]  The cabin's in the clearing down there.
[6672.67s -> 6675.96s]  There'll be a bunch of fellers hiding out there, too.
[6675.96s -> 6677.32s]  Are these fellers armed?
[6677.32s -> 6677.80s]  Armed?
[6677.80s -> 6678.44s]  No, it's by the rope.
[6678.44s -> 6678.84s]  Okay.
[6678.84s -> 6679.72s]  Where are your strangers?
[6679.72s -> 6680.52s]  Yep.
[6680.52s -> 6681.93s]  In Mojisco?
[6681.93s -> 6683.37s]  He'll be holed up in his cabin.
[6683.37s -> 6684.41s]  Stealth mission incoming.
[6684.41s -> 6684.81s]  Stealth?
[6684.81s -> 6685.69s]  Who's blind?
[6685.69s -> 6686.81s]  Likely is not.
[6686.81s -> 6687.85s]  And over there.
[6687.85s -> 6688.57s]  Someone's coming.
[6689.37s -> 6690.81s]  So, uh, is this going to tell him
[6690.81s -> 6691.85s]  we got another bit of pot?
[6698.54s -> 6699.58s]  I'll catch up.
[6699.58s -> 6700.30s]  It's a good idea.
[6700.30s -> 6700.54s]  All right.
[6700.54s -> 6703.66s]  So I got a throwing knife in his body's pain.
[6703.66s -> 6704.86s]  So you can tell him yourself.
[6705.74s -> 6707.80s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6707.80s -> 6710.60s]  If anyone's actually going to shoot the messenger,
[6710.60s -> 6712.28s]  it'd be that mean son of a bitch.
[6713.16s -> 6717.68s]  Okay.
[6717.68s -> 6722.46s]  What are we doing about the pisser, Morgan?
[6723.02s -> 6730.01s]  By the tree.
[6730.01s -> 6730.41s]  Wait.
[6730.41s -> 6730.97s]  Oh, no.
[6744.04s -> 6744.44s]  Okay.
[6745.40s -> 6753.16s]  I had to clean off.
[6754.27s -> 6755.39s]  How did he survive?
[6756.19s -> 6757.15s]  How did the guy to the right?
[6758.35s -> 6759.63s]  How did he live through that, man?
[6768.20s -> 6769.00s]  Take the lead.
[6769.00s -> 6769.64s]  Throw a weapon.
[6770.60s -> 6771.66s]  How do I aim this?
[6772.67s -> 6774.19s]  Is it like a bunch of drop or anything?
[6774.19s -> 6775.31s]  You want me to take him?
[6775.31s -> 6776.97s]  Nothing else from you.
[6781.18s -> 6781.98s]  Throw?
[6781.98s -> 6784.33s]  Stay here.
[6785.34s -> 6787.10s]  Don't you damn move.
[6787.10s -> 6797.24s]  It's on.
[6797.24s -> 6797.96s]  We move quick.
[6827.02s -> 6827.82s]  Let me start it over.
[6835.16s -> 6836.76s]  I want to like do it correct.
[6836.76s -> 6850.16s]  What are we doing about the pisser, Morgan?
[6850.16s -> 6850.40s]  All right.
[6850.40s -> 6851.28s]  So this was going to happen.
[6851.28s -> 6852.32s]  You, uh, Bill.
[6853.44s -> 6854.16s]  Bill, you're going in.
[6854.72s -> 6855.22s]  Okay.
[6872.41s -> 6872.91s]  Nice work.
[6885.13s -> 6886.17s]  No, I don't want these on.
[6886.17s -> 6887.29s]  I want like the regular knife.
[6891.15s -> 6897.90s]  Let's get close to these two.
[6897.90s -> 6900.30s]  Make sure you're going left to right.
[6901.18s -> 6905.45s]  I don't, I don't know how to stab somebody in the back.
[6907.69s -> 6908.81s]  Is it R2?
[6908.81s -> 6909.85s]  I've not, I haven't done this yet.
[6911.13s -> 6911.77s]  Oh, god damn it.
[6911.77s -> 6912.33s]  I don't know how to do it.
[6919.85s -> 6920.89s]  I was about to greet the guy.
[6940.04s -> 6941.16s]  Hello there.
[6941.16s -> 6941.48s]  Stab.
[6945.34s -> 6945.98s]  Got on the log.
[6947.85s -> 6948.89s]  Don't shoot Bill.
[6951.63s -> 6952.75s]  I've okay.
[6952.75s -> 6963.55s]  Come on, John.
[6963.55s -> 6970.43s]  Go for it.
[6970.43s -> 6971.31s]  Brutal.
[6971.31s -> 6977.50s]  All right.
[6977.50s -> 6979.98s]  So we're each going to throw knives at everybody over there.
[6980.62s -> 6982.59s]  Okay.
[6982.59s -> 6983.47s]  Let's do, hold on a minute.
[6983.47s -> 6984.11s]  Stay there, John.
[6984.75s -> 6991.45s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[6991.45s -> 7019.48s]  Should I, oh, I warned him.
[7021.98s -> 7022.38s]  Whoops.
[7023.42s -> 7023.90s]  It's on.
[7023.90s -> 7024.38s]  Let's do it.
[7025.18s -> 7025.66s]  Dead Eye.
[7029.10s -> 7029.90s]  Time for Dead Eye.
[7033.84s -> 7035.20s]  What happened with that?
[7035.20s -> 7035.52s]  Okay.
[7036.48s -> 7047.08s]  Watch out, John.
[7047.08s -> 7047.88s]  John, get out of the way.
[7048.76s -> 7049.48s]  Okay.
[7049.48s -> 7050.52s]  John, please kill him.
[7050.52s -> 7051.56s]  Thank you.
[7051.56s -> 7057.02s]  Who's left?
[7057.02s -> 7061.87s]  I got a tomahawk?
[7070.86s -> 7071.66s]  Ow.
[7071.90s -> 7081.53s]  That guy fucking comes from.
[7081.53s -> 7085.45s]  I gotta get a better spot.
[7085.45s -> 7086.41s]  Give me a better weapon, too.
[7086.41s -> 7087.05s]  Give me this thing.
[7102.92s -> 7103.40s]  What?
[7103.40s -> 7105.45s]  I just pulled the guy's head off.
[7114.56s -> 7123.88s]  Okay.
[7123.88s -> 7124.12s]  Got him.
[7128.12s -> 7129.00s]  Where's my shotgun?
[7133.31s -> 7134.11s]  That's even better.
[7135.24s -> 7135.96s]  There's a guy in here.
[7142.33s -> 7142.81s]  I'm ready.
[7144.59s -> 7144.99s]  I'm ready.
[7144.99s -> 7145.87s]  Once this guy opens the door,
[7145.87s -> 7146.99s]  I'm going to tomahawk him right in the head.
[7152.36s -> 7152.68s]  Hello.
[7156.04s -> 7156.28s]  What?
[7156.28s -> 7157.24s]  I was going to do it to you.
[7171.16s -> 7172.04s]  All right.
[7172.04s -> 7172.76s]  Browse the place.
[7188.78s -> 7189.34s]  That's a good point.
[7208.56s -> 7214.64s]  So it's the first full body shot we've had in like an hour.
[7214.64s -> 7214.88s]  Come on.
[7215.84s -> 7221.37s]  Let's get the camp.
[7222.01s -> 7223.29s]  So you got the cash then?
[7223.29s -> 7224.33s]  What cash?
[7224.33s -> 7227.21s]  Here's usually some cash in the chimney.
[7227.21s -> 7228.49s]  I'll check it.
[7228.49s -> 7230.97s]  Rest of you boys get the cab quick.
[7230.97s -> 7231.77s]  See Arthur?
[7231.77s -> 7232.97s]  I ain't so bad.
[7232.97s -> 7233.61s]  Hey, Bill.
[7234.49s -> 7238.09s]  You tell Dutch old Karen ain't worth killing just yet.
[7238.73s -> 7239.37s]  You're right.
[7239.37s -> 7239.85s]  You are.
[7240.57s -> 7240.89s]  All right.
[7240.89s -> 7241.69s]  Cash in the chimney.
[7242.65s -> 7243.13s]  You got it.
[7246.48s -> 7251.55s]  Slugs, shock and shells, biscuits and all that stuff.
[7252.43s -> 7253.15s]  Kill that guy.
[7253.79s -> 7257.82s]  I'm not going to kill him yet.
[7258.76s -> 7259.32s]  Pots and pans?
[7259.32s -> 7259.80s]  What's in here?
[7259.80s -> 7260.60s]  Kentucky bourbon?
[7261.24s -> 7263.40s]  I can't carry any more Kentucky bourbon.
[7263.96s -> 7279.10s]  Well, why the hell not?
[7279.10s -> 7279.58s]  Now I can.
[7280.70s -> 7284.62s]  Just replace it.
[7291.21s -> 7292.09s]  Chimney.
[7292.09s -> 7292.73s]  Money clip.
[7293.37s -> 7294.09s]  How much is in there?
[7295.74s -> 7296.38s]  13 bucks.
[7296.38s -> 7296.94s]  That's not bad.
[7296.94s -> 7297.34s]  More money.
[7298.84s -> 7299.96s]  How many money clips are over here?
[7299.96s -> 7300.28s]  12.
[7300.28s -> 7301.08s]  There's another one right there.
[7302.41s -> 7302.73s]  Damn.
[7305.12s -> 7306.56s]  They're going right into the donation box.
[7307.12s -> 7308.24s]  No, donation box.
[7308.88s -> 7309.36s]  Box.
[7309.36s -> 7310.40s]  Why can I not say that word?
[7311.28s -> 7312.48s]  Search the draw.
[7314.94s -> 7315.50s]  Snake oil.
[7315.50s -> 7316.54s]  Can I take any more snake oil?
[7317.10s -> 7319.21s]  I can.
[7319.21s -> 7319.85s]  Anything else?
[7323.93s -> 7324.43s]  Box.
[7326.86s -> 7327.66s]  Money in the chimney.
[7327.66s -> 7330.06s]  Ooh, double-barreled shotgun.
[7331.16s -> 7333.08s]  Yeah, I believe so.
[7335.36s -> 7336.00s]  Oh, man.
[7336.80s -> 7341.95s]  Clean the double-barreled shotgun.
[7342.59s -> 7353.58s]  Cleaning weapons with gun oil will improve their condition and performance.
[7353.58s -> 7354.14s]  Okay, cool.
[7354.78s -> 7357.12s]  That's cool.
[7358.78s -> 7359.90s]  Any more dust on it?
[7360.54s -> 7363.45s]  It looks good.
[7364.01s -> 7369.02s]  Looks really good, actually.
[7369.82s -> 7373.42s]  All right, let's put it back.
[7374.14s -> 7375.74s]  All right.
[7375.74s -> 7376.78s]  Search the chimney.
[7376.78s -> 7377.18s]  Chimney.
[7384.09s -> 7384.41s]  Six.
[7385.37s -> 7389.39s]  Holy fuck.
[7389.39s -> 7395.24s]  That's a lot of money.
[7399.16s -> 7399.80s]  $600.
[7400.76s -> 7401.47s]  Let's see.
[7401.47s -> 7402.11s]  Mission complete.
[7402.67s -> 7405.20s]  Under the threat of torture,
[7405.20s -> 7407.92s]  Ciaran leads Arthur, John, and Bill up to Six Point Cabin
[7407.92s -> 7411.74s]  where he claims Old Driscoll is holed up.
[7412.38s -> 7414.19s]  I got an F.
[7424.12s -> 7424.76s]  Now, let's head back.
[7425.56s -> 7430.91s]  Okay.
[7430.91s -> 7431.39s]  Anybody?
[7431.39s -> 7433.55s]  Actually, this body's to check over here.
[7435.71s -> 7436.67s]  Redo.
[7436.67s -> 7437.55s]  No, we don't need a redo.
[7438.19s -> 7441.13s]  We don't need a do-over.
[7443.13s -> 7444.09s]  What is that animal?
[7444.89s -> 7446.09s]  That's like a skunk wolf.
[7446.09s -> 7446.57s]  What is this?
[7450.17s -> 7450.57s]  No, no.
[7450.57s -> 7451.21s]  What is that thing?
[7451.77s -> 7455.21s]  Hold on.
[7455.21s -> 7456.17s]  I got to catch the skunk wolf.
[7456.81s -> 7460.14s]  Study.
[7461.80s -> 7462.28s]  Study.
[7464.68s -> 7465.08s]  Study.
[7466.84s -> 7469.66s]  I thought I could have had it.
[7469.66s -> 7473.02s]  There he is.
[7473.02s -> 7483.23s]  God damn it.
[7483.23s -> 7484.59s]  Next time I'll get the skunk wolf.
[7484.59s -> 7485.79s]  It'll happen.
[7485.79s -> 7493.10s]  I can't.
[7493.10s -> 7493.82s]  I'm trying to jump.
[7494.38s -> 7496.73s]  Trying to jump inside of his cabin.
[7498.01s -> 7498.89s]  Oh, shit.
[7498.89s -> 7499.61s]  It didn't work.
[7500.97s -> 7501.29s]  Hey.
[7517.79s -> 7519.07s]  Why is it still going?
[7519.07s -> 7519.47s]  Wait.
[7520.28s -> 7520.60s]  Wait.
[7521.40s -> 7534.19s]  Ooh.
[7534.19s -> 7535.63s]  What is in here?
[7539.95s -> 7540.67s]  Why is it still?
[7540.67s -> 7541.63s]  Yeah, it's not a car.
[7541.63s -> 7542.43s]  What am I talking?
[7542.43s -> 7543.79s]  It's not like you're stepping on gas.
[7544.67s -> 7546.11s]  Seven repeater cartridges.
[7547.07s -> 7549.16s]  Pistol cartridges.
[7549.16s -> 7549.64s]  Damn.
[7549.64s -> 7550.60s]  What else you got in here?
[7552.80s -> 7553.36s]  What?
[7553.36s -> 7556.28s]  No, don't stand on the box.
[7558.76s -> 7559.08s]  Chest.
[7562.00s -> 7562.80s]  Herbivore bait.
[7564.96s -> 7565.68s]  Predator bait.
[7568.86s -> 7569.82s]  Shotgun shells.
[7569.82s -> 7570.62s]  That's a lot of stuff.
[7571.34s -> 7576.00s]  That's it, right?
[7579.74s -> 7581.34s]  It's a bunch of vegan food.
[7583.58s -> 7584.38s]  What about the horses?
[7584.38s -> 7586.30s]  These look like good horses.
[7586.30s -> 7586.78s]  Can I?
[7586.78s -> 7587.42s]  What about this guy?
[7587.42s -> 7589.42s]  I can throw this guy off and loot his body, right?
[7595.04s -> 7595.28s]  What?
[7596.75s -> 7597.31s]  Oh, fuck.
[7597.31s -> 7597.71s]  Oh.
[7597.71s -> 7598.27s]  Oh, fuck.
[7598.27s -> 7598.75s]  Oh, fuck.
[7599.39s -> 7599.87s]  Oh, fuck.
[7600.59s -> 7601.07s]  Oh, fuck.
[7601.07s -> 7601.95s]  What if I pretend it's mine?
[7611.56s -> 7611.88s]  Hey.
[7635.47s -> 7638.46s]  Hey.
[7638.46s -> 7638.70s]  Wait.
[7638.70s -> 7638.94s]  Hey.
[7639.74s -> 7652.46s]  What?
[7652.46s -> 7653.93s]  Oh, jeez.
[7653.93s -> 7655.53s]  It's just too many people here now.
[7656.41s -> 7662.59s]  Who are these?
[7662.59s -> 7663.63s]  Hey, get.
[7665.63s -> 7666.11s]  Come here.
[7669.45s -> 7670.25s]  Get up.
[7670.25s -> 7671.29s]  Where's my horse?
[7672.33s -> 7673.21s]  Where's my horse?
[7676.73s -> 7678.57s]  Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7679.45s -> 7682.65s]  All right.
[7682.65s -> 7683.13s]  Settle down.
[7684.09s -> 7684.89s]  Wait.
[7684.89s -> 7685.76s]  I found him.
[7701.68s -> 7702.08s]  Where?
[7702.08s -> 7702.64s]  Where?
[7702.64s -> 7703.20s]  Where is he?
[7703.84s -> 7704.24s]  Where did he?
[7704.88s -> 7716.30s]  There he is.
[7716.30s -> 7716.86s]  That's not it.
[7716.86s -> 7717.90s]  These are two different animals.
[7718.46s -> 7718.78s]  Sorry.
[7718.78s -> 7719.18s]  Study.
[7721.53s -> 7722.17s]  Got it.
[7722.17s -> 7724.00s]  I thought that just said threaten.
[7728.14s -> 7728.78s]  Almost got it.
[7729.66s -> 7731.74s]  All right.
[7731.74s -> 7733.50s]  We're fine.
[7733.50s -> 7734.30s]  Let me pet the horse.
[7734.30s -> 7735.34s]  Yeah, good boy.
[7735.34s -> 7740.57s]  You're just, you're doing fine.
[7740.57s -> 7740.89s]  You're good.
[7743.92s -> 7750.20s]  That guy, I could loot that guy's body when he was on the ground.
[7750.20s -> 7750.92s]  I thought he was dead.
[7779.63s -> 7780.27s]  That's funny.
[7781.71s -> 7783.39s]  No, I can't go this way.
[7783.39s -> 7784.35s]  It's not a car.
[7784.35s -> 7786.75s]  Why can't it just be, why can't it be armor on his legs?
[7787.23s -> 7789.24s]  Yeah.
[7789.24s -> 7789.72s]  Calm down.
[7789.72s -> 7790.36s]  Everything's fine.
[7794.76s -> 7795.48s]  I got to go home.
[7797.04s -> 7797.60s]  New mission.
[7829.13s -> 7830.01s]  Why am I dead eye?
[7830.81s -> 7837.08s]  Study.
[7860.99s -> 7862.11s]  Big animal.
[7862.11s -> 7863.68s]  All right.
[7863.68s -> 7864.72s]  Let's get a way point here.
[7865.36s -> 7869.21s]  What the hell am I?
[7869.21s -> 7869.37s]  Okay.
[7869.37s -> 7870.65s]  This is bounty $25.
[7871.77s -> 7875.18s]  Where did I end up?
[7875.18s -> 7877.18s]  Am I, I still have a bounty?
[7881.04s -> 7882.88s]  Do I have to pay these guys or get rid of these guys?
[7882.88s -> 7883.92s]  I think I have to get rid of these guys.
[7884.56s -> 7885.77s]  Now I got to get rid of these guys.
[7886.73s -> 7887.21s]  All right.
[7887.21s -> 7888.01s]  I'm going to go pay it off.
[7888.81s -> 7890.46s]  So I'm just going to go this way.
[7891.42s -> 7911.40s]  So can I talk to them or is that a bounty hunter?
[7914.25s -> 7918.19s]  No, I think he's just, oh, well, it is.
[7923.15s -> 7923.87s]  It is these guys.
[7923.87s -> 7924.35s]  No, it's not.
[7935.92s -> 7936.56s]  Robin Hood.
[7937.36s -> 7939.28s]  Sheriff Nottingham, you're done stand a chance.
[7951.80s -> 7952.12s]  Okay.
[7952.12s -> 7956.46s]  I need to heal.
[7956.46s -> 7959.50s]  Let's go with the, let's do some more Kentucky bourbon.
[7959.50s -> 7959.82s]  Why not?
[7960.70s -> 7968.25s]  Your health core is empty.
[7968.81s -> 7969.45s]  Oh yeah.
[7969.45s -> 7970.01s]  You need to eat.
[7972.91s -> 7973.23s]  Okay.
[7973.23s -> 7976.86s]  We got, I thought I could eat the glove.
[7978.46s -> 7979.02s]  I'm hungry.
[7979.02s -> 7979.74s]  Smoke a cigar.
[7980.30s -> 7981.02s]  Canned peaches.
[7981.74s -> 7984.27s]  Okay.
[7984.27s -> 7984.59s]  There we go.
[7984.59s -> 7985.98s]  We're good.
[7985.98s -> 7998.12s]  Maybe one more of those back to what we were doing.
[8003.66s -> 8004.54s]  Health is fine.
[8004.54s -> 8011.13s]  Stamina is not great, but now that my bounty is taken care of,
[8011.85s -> 8018.99s]  I don't want to work them too hard.
[8018.99s -> 8019.95s]  Don't work the horse too hard.
[8020.67s -> 8021.55s]  He doesn't deserve that.
[8021.55s -> 8022.59s]  How do you feed the horse?
[8022.59s -> 8024.11s]  Everyone's saying feed horse, feed horse.
[8028.97s -> 8029.61s]  Excuse me.
[8034.64s -> 8038.81s]  Oh, I got to get, I got to kill five rabbits on horseback
[8038.81s -> 8039.93s]  and I got to unlock a super move.
[8050.99s -> 8051.63s]  Here, eat this.
[8052.51s -> 8053.31s]  Why am I getting the gun?
[8060.56s -> 8061.44s]  See, he's fine.
[8067.58s -> 8068.14s]  Rabbit meat.
[8071.55s -> 8072.43s]  I'm going to skip the rabbit.
[8074.06s -> 8074.54s]  I want to do this.
[8074.54s -> 8075.74s]  Let me just get five rabbits.
[8078.11s -> 8078.83s]  Holy shit.
[8084.03s -> 8084.35s]  Okay.
[8084.99s -> 8090.76s]  I just revealed the Scooby Doo monster.
[8091.40s -> 8092.38s]  That was pretty wild.
[8092.38s -> 8093.10s]  All right.
[8093.10s -> 8096.28s]  Let me do, let me do a few more rabbits.
[8099.42s -> 8102.22s]  I want to get the four more rabbits so I can unlock something.
[8103.69s -> 8104.65s]  Tell me if you see any rabbits.
[8104.65s -> 8106.25s]  Just scream as loud as you can if you see one.
[8118.11s -> 8119.15s]  I've seen a lot of people scream.
[8119.15s -> 8121.63s]  I don't see any rabbits though, unfortunately guys.
[8122.27s -> 8124.51s]  I don't know what the fuck this bullshit is that you guys are doing.
[8125.31s -> 8133.72s]  I don't know what kind of bullshit you guys are running here.
[8134.52s -> 8151.31s]  I almost PUBG'd that guy.
[8151.31s -> 8152.35s]  That would've been pretty crazy.
[8158.01s -> 8176.44s]  That was not that far.
[8177.24s -> 8178.99s]  That was not far.
[8181.39s -> 8182.83s]  That really wasn't that far.
[8182.83s -> 8184.83s]  That was maybe eight feet.
[8185.55s -> 8192.46s]  This is going to be like an RPG.
[8192.46s -> 8194.46s]  Anytime I play a turn-based RPG,
[8194.46s -> 8196.78s]  I'm so bad at managing everybody's health
[8196.78s -> 8199.58s]  that instead of buying the thing that heals a party member,
[8199.66s -> 8201.98s]  I just buy like 60 revives.
[8202.62s -> 8203.90s]  Because they come back with full health.
[8203.90s -> 8205.50s]  Just, you know, let them die and bring them back.
[8219.64s -> 8221.88s]  Let's take this scenery in, for God's sakes.
[8227.47s -> 8228.03s]  He wastes...
[8228.03s -> 8228.83s]  All right, wait, wait, wait.
[8228.83s -> 8231.39s]  I'm critical with stamina right now.
[8233.36s -> 8233.76s]  Let's see.
[8233.76s -> 8234.96s]  I got canned peas.
[8235.60s -> 8237.12s]  I need something more substantial than that.
[8243.90s -> 8244.54s]  That's all right.
[8251.20s -> 8251.60s]  Did I...
[8256.08s -> 8257.04s]  Canned strawberry, did it.
[8257.84s -> 8261.37s]  I can't use...
[8261.37s -> 8262.89s]  I can't eat strawberries when I'm on a horse.
[8263.69s -> 8264.19s]  Why?
[8264.83s -> 8266.46s]  Because the horse is stamina.
[8266.46s -> 8267.50s]  Well, then let's feed him.
[8267.50s -> 8269.02s]  God, come on, man.
[8269.66s -> 8276.10s]  Feed him.
[8277.44s -> 8289.04s]  There he goes.
[8289.04s -> 8289.54s]  He's fine.
[8290.08s -> 8291.60s]  Let's clean him.
[8292.32s -> 8295.92s]  Wait, I can clean him like this?
[8296.72s -> 8304.00s]  Let's...
[8304.00s -> 8304.96s]  I can brush him from here.
[8306.08s -> 8307.84s]  I can study him.
[8309.28s -> 8310.88s]  Oh, I learned about my horse.
[8311.52s -> 8315.07s]  Okay, let's go.
[8315.07s -> 8317.30s]  Not with a saddle on.
[8319.89s -> 8320.85s]  What is a horse core?
[8321.73s -> 8322.98s]  Uh, that's...
[8324.85s -> 8325.35s]  I don't know.
[8328.62s -> 8336.51s]  Almost back to camp.
[8337.47s -> 8338.11s]  No scenic route.
[8338.11s -> 8338.61s]  Let's just go.
[8341.95s -> 8344.19s]  Intel horse 2 duo.
[8348.80s -> 8349.30s]  Pretty good.
[8350.35s -> 8350.91s]  Pretty close.
[8363.22s -> 8364.02s]  More things to study.
[8364.82s -> 8372.75s]  I hope I didn't have the stupid Bambi on my back.
[8373.47s -> 8375.98s]  We're going downhill.
[8375.98s -> 8376.86s]  This is going pretty fast.
[8377.50s -> 8382.85s]  What are these?
[8383.55s -> 8385.07s]  Is it a pig?
[8385.79s -> 8397.17s]  Got it.
[8397.17s -> 8402.83s]  Well, I learned about it.
[8402.83s -> 8404.03s]  This is gonna be okay, right?
[8404.03s -> 8404.53s]  Yeah.
[8406.66s -> 8407.16s]  Almost back.
[8407.78s -> 8411.58s]  How many giga horse does it...
[8411.58s -> 8412.08s]  What's wrong with them?
[8413.23s -> 8413.87s]  What?
[8413.87s -> 8414.37s]  Bill.
[8418.59s -> 8419.55s]  We're fine.
[8419.55s -> 8420.03s]  It's me.
[8420.03s -> 8420.35s]  What?
[8420.35s -> 8421.55s]  They don't know what I look like?
[8422.27s -> 8427.06s]  I guess everyone looks like they're in the same clothes.
[8427.86s -> 8429.26s]  We're far away.
[8429.90s -> 8431.66s]  These guys have binoculars though, right?
[8433.55s -> 8434.35s]  All right.
[8434.35s -> 8434.83s]  How we doing?
[8434.83s -> 8436.03s]  How's the land doing here?
[8436.83s -> 8437.87s]  $53.
[8437.87s -> 8438.59s]  We're doing pretty well.
[8441.94s -> 8442.44s]  Not yet.
[8442.90s -> 8448.38s]  Let me bring the carcass to this guy.
[8450.88s -> 8452.72s]  Is there no running rule in camp or something?
[8452.72s -> 8453.52s]  Why can't I not run?
[8458.61s -> 8459.49s]  All right, I've got something for you.
[8461.52s -> 8462.16s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8465.68s -> 8466.48s]  Satchel rule.
[8466.48s -> 8467.68s]  Perch leather working to upgrade.
[8467.76s -> 8468.48s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8468.48s -> 8469.04s]  I don't...
[8469.04s -> 8470.00s]  Perfect deer pelt.
[8470.00s -> 8470.88s]  Perfect buck pelt.
[8470.88s -> 8472.48s]  Perfect elk pelt.
[8472.48s -> 8473.20s]  I can't.
[8473.20s -> 8473.68s]  I need...
[8474.40s -> 8475.57s]  Well, let's bring it to him.
[8479.71s -> 8481.07s]  Good rabbit pelt.
[8481.87s -> 8484.19s]  That's not perfect.
[8486.24s -> 8487.44s]  Poor deer carcass.
[8487.44s -> 8488.24s]  Zero dollars.
[8488.24s -> 8488.74s]  We'll eat it.
[8492.00s -> 8492.88s]  I'm gonna keep that.
[8495.86s -> 8501.07s]  Good job, Arthur.
[8501.07s -> 8501.47s]  What do I got?
[8501.47s -> 8502.19s]  I got 200 bucks.
[8502.19s -> 8504.27s]  I could give some more money to the camp, can't I?
[8511.63s -> 8512.03s]  What do we got?
[8512.03s -> 8512.75s]  53 bucks?
[8523.87s -> 8524.19s]  But is...
[8524.19s -> 8525.23s]  Am I doing this right?
[8526.64s -> 8527.20s]  20 bucks.
[8528.61s -> 8529.33s]  20 dollars.
[8533.02s -> 8534.14s]  74 dollars total.
[8539.52s -> 8541.04s]  I'm unlocking more things, right?
[8549.06s -> 8549.46s]  Okay.
[8551.84s -> 8552.40s]  Big bits.
[8553.36s -> 8554.48s]  It upgrades the camp.
[8554.48s -> 8555.36s]  It seems that way.
[8556.00s -> 8557.04s]  Let's eat.
[8557.68s -> 8563.02s]  The more you donate, the better your ending.
[8564.74s -> 8565.22s]  Interesting.
[8565.86s -> 8576.93s]  Let's eat it quick before it goes bad.
[8577.65s -> 8582.86s]  I don't need to clean that?
[8582.86s -> 8583.18s]  Okay.
[8590.91s -> 8591.47s]  All right.
[8591.47s -> 8592.27s]  Where's the ledger?
[8592.99s -> 8596.13s]  Somebody said the ledger next to the donation box.
[8596.13s -> 8596.93s]  Is there one here?
[8604.16s -> 8605.20s]  No, it's not unlocked yet.
[8605.20s -> 8605.70s]  Okay.
[8606.08s -> 8606.75s]  All right.
[8606.75s -> 8608.03s]  I'm gonna just go do...
[8608.03s -> 8609.07s]  There's a lot of missions here.
[8612.64s -> 8613.14s]  D.
[8614.98s -> 8615.48s]  Dutch.
[8616.02s -> 8616.52s]  Or...
[8617.30s -> 8617.80s]  Damn.
[8619.20s -> 8619.68s]  Minimum just...
[8619.68s -> 8620.32s]  I'm standing right here.
[8620.32s -> 8621.28s]  I might as well do it.
[8621.28s -> 8621.78s]  Dutch?
[8622.16s -> 8622.88s]  Miss O'Shea?
[8623.52s -> 8624.02s]  Well.
[8624.48s -> 8626.72s]  Feels like we are finally getting back on our feet.
[8627.76s -> 8630.56s]  You, uh, find a buyer for them bonds we stole?
[8630.56s -> 8631.06s]  Not yet.
[8631.76s -> 8633.68s]  But Jose is working on it.
[8633.68s -> 8635.81s]  When we heading west?
[8637.39s -> 8637.89s]  Soon?
[8638.90s -> 8639.40s]  I don't know.
[8641.23s -> 8641.73s]  Feels like...
[8643.07s -> 8644.03s]  Things have changed.
[8644.75s -> 8646.03s]  The whole world's changed.
[8647.44s -> 8649.20s]  And they don't want folk like us no more.
[8650.83s -> 8651.79s]  We're being hunted.
[8652.35s -> 8654.11s]  We are smarter than them.
[8654.11s -> 8657.63s]  Only the feeblest of men take jobs in the government.
[8658.27s -> 8659.23s]  How do you decent?
[8659.23s -> 8660.67s]  I hope so.
[8660.67s -> 8661.17s]  Trimby?
[8661.17s -> 8662.27s]  Trust Dodge, Mr. Morgan.
[8663.15s -> 8663.79s]  You have to.
[8663.79s -> 8664.75s]  They got Micah!
[8665.55s -> 8666.05s]  Dutch!
[8666.43s -> 8667.17s]  Upper!
[8667.73s -> 8668.29s]  What's going on?
[8668.29s -> 8669.01s]  They got Micah.
[8669.01s -> 8669.51s]  He...
[8669.51s -> 8671.01s]  I'll test it after the, uh, cutscene.
[8671.01s -> 8672.05s]  He was in Strawberry and...
[8672.05s -> 8673.01s]  It's okay, son.
[8673.01s -> 8673.51s]  Breathe.
[8674.96s -> 8676.00s]  They nearly lynched me.
[8676.80s -> 8677.30s]  They...
[8677.84s -> 8681.04s]  They got Micah in the sheriffs in Strawberry.
[8681.04s -> 8682.48s]  And there's Tarka hanging him.
[8682.48s -> 8683.12s]  Here's hoping.
[8683.76s -> 8684.48s]  Arthur.
[8684.48s -> 8685.28s]  What?
[8685.28s -> 8687.52s]  The fool brought this on himself.
[8687.52s -> 8689.04s]  You know my feelings about him, Dutch.
[8689.04s -> 8692.40s]  You think I can't see past his bluster to the heart and side?
[8692.40s -> 8693.84s]  He is a fine man.
[8693.84s -> 8694.40s]  No.
[8694.40s -> 8696.08s]  I ain't saving that fool.
[8696.08s -> 8697.28s]  I can't go.
[8697.28s -> 8699.20s]  My face will be all over West Elizabeth.
[8699.20s -> 8700.32s]  I am asking.
[8700.88s -> 8701.92s]  He would do it for you.
[8702.56s -> 8707.22s]  I don't think he would, but fine Arthur.
[8707.22s -> 8708.10s]  You okay, Lenny?
[8709.20s -> 8710.00s]  Yeah.
[8710.00s -> 8711.04s]  Of course I'm okay.
[8711.04s -> 8712.00s]  You don't seem okay.
[8712.00s -> 8714.08s]  You take that kid into town.
[8714.08s -> 8716.16s]  Valentine, not Strawberry.
[8716.16s -> 8716.88s]  Get him drunk.
[8717.52s -> 8718.16s]  And Arthur?
[8718.80s -> 8720.40s]  No crazy business.
[8720.40s -> 8721.68s]  I'm giving that up.
[8721.68s -> 8723.84s]  And you get Micah out of that jail.
[8724.40s -> 8724.90s]  Jailbreak?
[8725.92s -> 8727.36s]  I think I can handle this.
[8727.36s -> 8728.00s]  Come on, son.
[8729.04s -> 8730.88s]  I'll get to it, Dutch.
[8730.88s -> 8732.72s]  Just can't drop everything.
[8733.44s -> 8734.06s]  All right.
[8734.06s -> 8734.54s]  Jailbreak.
[8735.34s -> 8737.26s]  Who's driving?
[8737.90s -> 8738.38s]  Both of us.
[8739.26s -> 8743.47s]  Hold on.
[8743.47s -> 8743.95s]  Let me make sure.
[8748.19s -> 8750.46s]  All right.
[8750.46s -> 8753.58s]  I need someone to break this down for me for just a second here.
[8753.58s -> 8754.62s]  Like just somebody human being.
[8756.78s -> 8761.42s]  So what Deadeye is both sticks together, right?
[8761.42s -> 8762.06s]  At the same time.
[8762.78s -> 8767.98s]  And then you move it around and then press R2 and you're done.
[8767.98s -> 8769.18s]  Or how is it?
[8769.18s -> 8769.82s]  I remember.
[8769.82s -> 8770.38s]  I don't remember.
[8771.58s -> 8772.86s]  It's just R3.
[8772.86s -> 8773.10s]  Okay.
[8774.66s -> 8776.02s]  And then you just aim around.
[8776.02s -> 8777.46s]  Do I have to hold R3?
[8777.46s -> 8779.94s]  R3 and then aim around and then press R2.
[8780.82s -> 8788.70s]  So I have to hold in R3 the whole time.
[8788.70s -> 8788.86s]  Okay.
[8788.86s -> 8791.02s]  Just click it and then I aim around then press R2.
[8791.02s -> 8791.58s]  Okay.
[8791.58s -> 8792.38s]  Don't need to hold anything.
[8793.02s -> 8793.98s]  So my apologies.
[8793.98s -> 8796.62s]  I just kind of threw myself back into the game.
[8801.54s -> 8803.06s]  R3, set shots, take shots.
[8803.06s -> 8803.38s]  Cool.
[8803.38s -> 8803.94s]  All right, let's go.
[8804.66s -> 8806.59s]  Run him over.
[8806.59s -> 8807.39s]  Run these people over.
[8809.70s -> 8810.02s]  Thank you.
[8810.74s -> 8811.86s]  Thank you, Chad.
[8812.50s -> 8813.22s]  Appreciate it.
[8817.18s -> 8819.50s]  Look like you've been through it.
[8819.50s -> 8823.70s]  I'm gonna get off that mountain then this.
[8824.34s -> 8827.01s]  He's got a crazy side off him.
[8827.01s -> 8829.01s]  What are you boys?
[8829.01s -> 8831.81s]  You're supposed to be scouting ahead for us.
[8831.81s -> 8834.77s]  I kept asking him what we was doing but he was...
[8834.77s -> 8836.69s]  You worried too much, kid.
[8836.69s -> 8837.89s]  Just just some business.
[8837.89s -> 8839.33s]  Practice on animals and minerals?
[8839.33s -> 8840.21s]  You know how he is.
[8847.71s -> 8848.35s]  I see a rabbit.
[8848.35s -> 8848.91s]  I gotta shoot it.
[8848.91s -> 8850.43s]  Before we even got there.
[8850.43s -> 8852.27s]  Then we ran into some fellas.
[8852.27s -> 8853.55s]  One of them, Micah New.
[8853.55s -> 8854.27s]  Drank some more.
[8854.83s -> 8856.99s]  And this is supposed to be a dry town we're in too.
[8857.63s -> 8859.15s]  Man, he shoots one of them.
[8859.15s -> 8860.27s]  I don't know how that goes.
[8860.27s -> 8862.75s]  With the swiftness here, man, why would we be taking our time here?
[8862.75s -> 8864.67s]  Happened like the strike of a match.
[8864.67s -> 8866.59s]  The Lord was on his fast too.
[8866.59s -> 8869.55s]  Practice Deadeye on animals.
[8869.55s -> 8870.35s]  But I got a way.
[8870.35s -> 8870.91s]  Just about.
[8871.55s -> 8873.47s]  All right, I got a host of this.
[8873.47s -> 8875.15s]  We'll take care of it.
[8875.15s -> 8876.27s]  So you're gonna go get them?
[8877.07s -> 8877.79s]  I'll come with you.
[8878.83s -> 8879.87s]  You leave it to me.
[8879.87s -> 8882.19s]  For now, let's drink some.
[8882.19s -> 8884.03s]  This game is about taking your time.
[8884.03s -> 8886.03s]  It was Trent that started all this.
[8886.03s -> 8886.43s]  That's true.
[8886.43s -> 8887.55s]  I didn't see the train go by yet.
[8888.51s -> 8890.35s]  Because you know if the train had come by, I would have.
[8890.35s -> 8891.47s]  I would have rowed into it.
[8891.47s -> 8891.79s]  Okay.
[8892.43s -> 8900.35s]  And gone.
[8914.62s -> 8915.98s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8915.98s -> 8916.54s]  Put it away.
[8916.54s -> 8917.26s]  Put it down.
[8917.26s -> 8917.66s]  Oh my.
[8920.45s -> 8921.54s]  Study.
[8922.10s -> 8924.13s]  Okay.
[8924.13s -> 8925.01s]  Kentucky Sadler.
[8925.57s -> 8927.02s]  Kentucky Sadler.
[8927.02s -> 8927.26s]  Got it.
[8927.26s -> 8928.30s]  What about that thing over there?
[8928.94s -> 8932.85s]  Let's go.
[8933.41s -> 8934.13s]  Nice work.
[8938.30s -> 8939.82s]  In fact, I don't want the bow out.
[8939.82s -> 8941.42s]  Give me the carbine.
[8941.42s -> 8942.38s]  Double barreled shotgun.
[8942.38s -> 8942.86s]  Who am I kidding?
[8943.82s -> 8944.54s]  I just got this.
[8945.34s -> 8952.56s]  So we're gonna jailbreak this guy.
[8953.20s -> 8958.26s]  Is this like a stealth thing here or are we just riding in?
[8958.98s -> 8960.00s]  Should I holster this?
[8960.80s -> 8972.99s]  You guys are just in the way.
[8972.99s -> 8979.84s]  Okay, we can move a little faster here.
[8993.82s -> 8994.78s]  Weapon shop right here.
[8995.58s -> 8997.31s]  I will remember that.
[9001.38s -> 9001.70s]  Pitch.
[9002.50s -> 9003.70s]  Oh, we're not.
[9004.34s -> 9004.98s]  We're not.
[9004.98s -> 9005.70s]  We got a different.
[9005.70s -> 9006.98s]  We gotta find a different parking spot.
[9007.78s -> 9009.38s]  That one doesn't work anymore.
[9014.82s -> 9015.30s]  Over here.
[9018.18s -> 9021.34s]  All right, we're good.
[9023.94s -> 9024.50s]  Go to the bar.
[9035.33s -> 9035.73s]  Surprise.
[9035.73s -> 9037.09s]  Oh, it's a surprise birthday.
[9038.66s -> 9039.22s]  Surprise.
[9039.94s -> 9043.25s]  All right, this is what we drink.
[9043.25s -> 9046.03s]  This is a drinking contest.
[9063.38s -> 9064.90s]  I was defending myself.
[9064.90s -> 9067.22s]  Tommy, he'll be fine.
[9067.22s -> 9068.42s]  Have one for yourself.
[9069.73s -> 9070.29s]  Thank you.
[9071.41s -> 9071.73s]  All right.
[9074.13s -> 9075.73s]  Micah seemed to know a lot of people.
[9076.61s -> 9077.98s]  That was the problem.
[9077.98s -> 9078.62s]  How you mean?
[9079.26s -> 9083.62s]  I mean, I don't seen a lot of crazy, crazy stuff.
[9083.62s -> 9086.34s]  Like a crazy, crazy stuff.
[9086.34s -> 9087.54s]  Will you shut up?
[9087.54s -> 9088.98s]  Will you shut up?
[9088.98s -> 9089.94s]  Be quiet, buddy.
[9093.22s -> 9094.42s]  This guy's just being a dick.
[9095.06s -> 9095.86s]  You menace.
[9095.86s -> 9096.26s]  Dull.
[9099.52s -> 9100.48s]  Lead his fool alone.
[9101.36s -> 9102.72s]  Lead the fool alone.
[9102.72s -> 9109.49s]  I'm bored with being left alone.
[9109.49s -> 9110.05s]  Charming.
[9110.05s -> 9111.81s]  Listen, buddy.
[9111.81s -> 9113.68s]  You're a charming fellow.
[9114.32s -> 9115.04s]  One of the best.
[9115.76s -> 9118.90s]  But me and the kid hero, we're trying to talk business.
[9118.90s -> 9119.46s]  Chat.
[9119.46s -> 9122.18s]  Could you possibly leave us alone?
[9122.18s -> 9123.30s]  No offense intended.
[9125.33s -> 9127.81s]  Ain't no pleasing some folk.
[9130.00s -> 9132.00s]  The telltale game's choice.
[9132.48s -> 9142.16s]  That's too many.
[9154.18s -> 9156.75s]  Where'd my friend go?
[9160.90s -> 9162.82s]  Where's Lenny?
[9163.84s -> 9165.12s]  Tommy, where's Lenny?
[9168.53s -> 9170.21s]  Jen, you know where my friend is?
[9174.78s -> 9180.90s]  All right.
[9180.90s -> 9187.70s]  He's not back here.
[9195.74s -> 9196.46s]  Hey, whoa.
[9196.46s -> 9197.74s]  Hey, are you serious, buddy?
[9198.62s -> 9200.83s]  You're lucky I don't have control right now.
[9200.83s -> 9203.07s]  Otherwise, I would drive a horse in here and run you over.
[9203.79s -> 9215.38s]  Lenny.
[9215.94s -> 9219.23s]  Okay.
[9219.87s -> 9222.46s]  I've got my wits about me again.
[9228.51s -> 9228.83s]  What?
[9228.83s -> 9231.95s]  I don't understand.
[9234.90s -> 9236.02s]  Why did I end up back here?
[9243.33s -> 9244.61s]  Power of teleportation.
[9244.61s -> 9245.01s]  Wait.
[9245.01s -> 9245.49s]  Why?
[9245.49s -> 9245.73s]  What?
[9246.69s -> 9251.87s]  Did I get Luigi'd?
[9253.39s -> 9254.67s]  I actually got Luigi'd, I think.
[9254.67s -> 9255.23s]  That's what happened.
[9269.17s -> 9269.71s]  No.
[9269.71s -> 9270.51s]  Did I lose him again?
[9272.13s -> 9273.01s]  Oh, my God.
[9274.96s -> 9275.44s]  Oh, shit.
[9284.43s -> 9285.55s]  Go down the stairs.
[9316.30s -> 9317.58s]  What is happening?
[9317.58s -> 9319.02s]  Whoa, don't look at the dick.
[9319.02s -> 9319.50s]  Don't look.
[9319.50s -> 9319.82s]  Okay.
[9323.71s -> 9325.39s]  I'm in first person mode.
[9326.03s -> 9326.67s]  Oh, boy.
[9329.12s -> 9330.24s]  Find him in the saloon.
[9330.24s -> 9330.40s]  All right.
[9330.40s -> 9331.68s]  We're having like a great time.
[9348.29s -> 9349.41s]  Are they all Lenny?
[9352.54s -> 9352.78s]  What?
[9355.12s -> 9372.26s]  Turg.
[9372.26s -> 9373.22s]  Who's Turg?
[9375.52s -> 9376.56s]  Turg.
[9376.56s -> 9384.50s]  Can I sprint?
[9395.02s -> 9396.38s]  Can we fight each other?
[9396.38s -> 9397.74s]  It was going to be a slap contest.
[9398.70s -> 9404.82s]  Oh, this is so stupid.
[9404.82s -> 9405.14s]  I love it.
[9412.38s -> 9413.58s]  Oh, we got tankards now.
[9416.30s -> 9417.26s]  It's gone?
[9417.26s -> 9425.74s]  I'm just dropping the guy.
[9437.50s -> 9438.54s]  Why am I doing this?
[9439.18s -> 9449.54s]  There are pigs in this game.
[9463.23s -> 9464.93s]  Oh, that's not good.
[9464.93s -> 9465.81s]  Is this the law?
[9466.85s -> 9470.56s]  I have control.
[9471.12s -> 9472.24s]  I have control.
[9472.24s -> 9473.12s]  How do I?
[9473.12s -> 9473.68s]  Can I jump?
[9483.31s -> 9483.95s]  Got it.
[9483.95s -> 9484.99s]  It was blurry, but I got it.
[9485.71s -> 9497.12s]  Is that it?
[9497.12s -> 9498.16s]  Do I get to wake up now?
[9498.88s -> 9513.50s]  Ooh, weather change.
[9514.14s -> 9515.84s]  It's raining now.
[9515.84s -> 9521.12s]  You missed a sex scene.
[9521.12s -> 9522.64s]  Good job not getting banned.
[9527.65s -> 9530.13s]  Oh, that's all right.
[9530.69s -> 9534.45s]  I did lose the hat though, didn't I?
[9538.34s -> 9539.81s]  Do I have to buy another hat
[9539.81s -> 9541.57s]  or do I actually get to put it back on somehow?
[9545.15s -> 9545.95s]  I need to eat something.
[9546.59s -> 9552.11s]  Jesus.
[9552.83s -> 9559.38s]  Okay, I need to eat.
[9560.02s -> 9562.75s]  Now, let's see the details.
[9562.75s -> 9563.71s]  Did I do this one all right?
[9564.35s -> 9565.44s]  I think I missed it.
[9566.08s -> 9567.95s]  I need to eat.
[9568.67s -> 9569.23s]  What do we got?
[9570.19s -> 9572.67s]  I need canned sweet corn.
[9578.30s -> 9579.42s]  Hold triangle at rest.
[9583.49s -> 9584.85s]  Set up camp craft.
[9587.44s -> 9590.96s]  Show coffee requires a campfire.
[9590.96s -> 9591.44s]  Okay, hold on.
[9591.44s -> 9593.20s]  Let me set up campfire.
[9593.92s -> 9595.54s]  Do I need materials for this?
[9607.68s -> 9612.26s]  Craft and cook requires a percolator.
[9612.82s -> 9613.94s]  You don't have enough ingredients.
[9614.98s -> 9620.02s]  Am I slowly putting my face in the fire?
[9620.02s -> 9620.90s]  I can't make anything.
[9624.06s -> 9625.10s]  I can make health cure.
[9625.74s -> 9627.42s]  I can craft seven of these.
[9627.42s -> 9631.26s]  Potent health cure fully restores health
[9631.26s -> 9633.42s]  and fortifies moderately.
[9633.42s -> 9633.66s]  Okay.
[9634.46s -> 9636.98s]  Well, snake oil is the...
[9636.98s -> 9638.58s]  Fully restores deadeye and fortifies...
[9638.58s -> 9639.38s]  I'll get a bunch of these.
[9645.25s -> 9647.09s]  Can I fuck this up or do I just hit X?
[9649.44s -> 9649.84s]  Stow it.
[9650.56s -> 9656.74s]  Make another one.
[9663.87s -> 9665.07s]  It's idiot proof.
[9665.95s -> 9668.59s]  Hey, watch it.
[9670.46s -> 9672.06s]  Hey, watch it.
[9682.30s -> 9683.26s]  How's my health right now?
[9683.82s -> 9685.49s]  I guess it's...
[9685.49s -> 9686.13s]  I'm gonna use it.
[9687.01s -> 9687.57s]  Just drink it.
[9688.21s -> 9691.90s]  All right, I'll make one more.
[9694.24s -> 9694.96s]  Nice gameplay.
[9695.60s -> 9696.08s]  Thanks, dude.
[9698.75s -> 9699.47s]  This is the game.
[9705.10s -> 9708.38s]  Excuse me, elite red dead streamer coming through.
[9708.38s -> 9709.42s]  When did I ever say that?
[9710.30s -> 9715.52s]  I need tobacco.
[9715.52s -> 9716.00s]  I'll make it.
[9716.72s -> 9727.44s]  I guess I could just fortify it all, right?
[9728.08s -> 9736.19s]  Would you say this game is good or worth buying?
[9740.00s -> 9741.36s]  Yeah, I would probably say so.
[9742.08s -> 9744.48s]  Because I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.
[9754.45s -> 9758.05s]  I feel like I've gotten maybe like 1.8% through the game.
[9758.77s -> 9765.20s]  What about...
[9765.20s -> 9768.74s]  I need to fortify stamina.
[9769.46s -> 9772.58s]  Potent bitters.
[9772.58s -> 9774.02s]  So I need a burdock root.
[9774.66s -> 9779.82s]  All right, well, whatever.
[9780.38s -> 9781.10s]  I'm just gonna sleep.
[9781.82s -> 9785.18s]  Well, I just picked 20 hours of sleep.
[9785.90s -> 9793.02s]  PC version.
[9793.02s -> 9796.70s]  Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath on a PC version anytime soon.
[9796.70s -> 9798.22s]  First one never came out on PC.
[9800.78s -> 9802.58s]  When you gain or lose weight,
[9802.58s -> 9804.58s]  up or down will be shown in your health form.
[9805.38s -> 9808.32s]  It's a tear cap down.
[9808.32s -> 9815.73s]  All right.
[9818.24s -> 9820.08s]  So, where's my horse?
[9822.80s -> 9824.67s]  Is this thunder and lightning?
[9825.63s -> 9832.67s]  When am I gonna play with Ster?
[9833.87s -> 9838.06s]  Ster and I are gonna play Lethal League eventually here.
[9839.97s -> 9841.97s]  We've had no drop frames at all in about three hours.
[9844.75s -> 9848.19s]  So the reason why, you know, I don't want to be like,
[9848.19s -> 9851.15s]  oh, hey, man, ready to like stream Lethal League?
[9851.15s -> 9852.67s]  It's gonna be so much fun.
[9852.67s -> 9853.47s]  Hope you're ready.
[9854.11s -> 9855.63s]  And then the internet turns off in 20 minutes
[9855.63s -> 9856.99s]  and it's just like, okay, well, that was a waste of time.
[9858.03s -> 9865.71s]  What's going on here?
[9870.94s -> 9871.50s]  Riding down.
[9872.14s -> 9873.10s]  Slipped on a rock today.
[9873.90s -> 9874.70s]  Moss is slippery.
[9874.70s -> 9875.58s]  Be careful.
[9875.58s -> 9876.14s]  Back hurts.
[9890.56s -> 9892.18s]  Throwing knives.
[9895.38s -> 9911.06s]  You didn't know I was up here.
[9911.86s -> 9912.91s]  Like, let's be honest.
[9913.55s -> 9930.59s]  It's fucking raining right now.
[9930.59s -> 9940.59s]  Hey, I don't know if he's a reliable way for me to get down here.
[9940.59s -> 9947.41s]  You have to go all the way around.
[9947.41s -> 9948.29s]  I'm stuck here.
[9949.17s -> 9958.32s]  Right here is okay.
[9958.96s -> 9960.40s]  I should be able to slide down this, right?
[9961.28s -> 9962.22s]  It's not that far.
[9962.22s -> 9962.94s]  That's like two feet.
[9963.74s -> 9969.95s]  At least try and mitigate the damage, man.
[9970.91s -> 9974.62s]  Okay, where's my horse down here?
[9975.18s -> 9983.98s]  Oh, someone was on the ground there.
[9984.94s -> 9988.32s]  Pick and examine.
[9988.32s -> 9988.96s]  Pick up.
[9988.96s -> 9990.56s]  Pick and examine what?
[9990.56s -> 9993.62s]  Plant.
[9994.50s -> 9998.82s]  My horse is in town?
[9999.62s -> 10001.15s]  Well, how am I supposed to?
[10001.15s -> 10002.67s]  I have to have to walk back to town?
[10003.63s -> 10006.67s]  Okay, hat.
[10007.23s -> 10009.46s]  Pick up hat.
[10009.46s -> 10016.51s]  This shit ain't even my hat.
[10017.07s -> 10024.10s]  This is dealing with somebody's horse.
[10024.10s -> 10026.18s]  All right, it's kind of what's gonna have to happen.
[10028.90s -> 10030.26s]  Herb, pick up.
[10030.26s -> 10034.83s]  Herbalist.
[10036.74s -> 10038.34s]  Let's take a look at the map here.
[10040.99s -> 10041.87s]  Reverend Swanson.
[10044.21s -> 10045.17s]  I can run here.
[10046.37s -> 10048.05s]  I'm just gonna walk to Reverend Swanson's.
[10055.09s -> 10056.05s]  Let me take a potion.
[10056.77s -> 10062.21s]  We're good.
[10064.32s -> 10064.72s]  This way.
[10073.76s -> 10075.36s]  God, it's slippery up here.
[10075.36s -> 10082.29s]  I unlocked an herbalist challenge.
[10082.93s -> 10088.26s]  It's right here, right?
[10088.98s -> 10095.58s]  All right, is this guy wait?
[10096.30s -> 10106.08s]  Hello.
[10114.21s -> 10114.93s]  That's not the Reverend.
[10117.49s -> 10118.13s]  In this room?
[10118.13s -> 10118.53s]  Reverend?
[10119.17s -> 10121.17s]  Reverend Swanson.
[10122.64s -> 10123.20s]  Come to meet you.
[10123.20s -> 10128.61s]  Mr. Borg, sir, I took your advice.
[10128.61s -> 10130.45s]  And your God has finally deserted you.
[10130.45s -> 10131.25s]  Who is not without sin?
[10131.25s -> 10133.97s]  I took your advice, sir.
[10134.69s -> 10138.77s]  I have removed myself from Morpheus's embrace.
[10139.41s -> 10141.89s]  No more shall I think, sir.
[10141.89s -> 10143.41s]  I am free.
[10143.41s -> 10144.61s]  I am free.
[10145.17s -> 10146.69s]  You don't seem free, friend.
[10146.69s -> 10147.49s]  You seem drunk.
[10147.49s -> 10148.45s]  Sit down, Reverend.
[10148.45s -> 10149.33s]  We ain't finished.
[10149.33s -> 10150.13s]  You ain't finished.
[10150.13s -> 10151.33s]  Look at him.
[10151.33s -> 10151.97s]  He's finished.
[10151.97s -> 10153.97s]  None of us forced liquor down his throat, friend.
[10154.05s -> 10155.41s]  I just want him to play.
[10155.41s -> 10157.09s]  Now, firstly, we ain't friends.
[10157.73s -> 10159.41s]  Don't make no mistake on that subject.
[10159.41s -> 10161.73s]  Now, secondly, he can hardly see, let alone reason.
[10162.29s -> 10164.53s]  Now, reasoning ain't never been one of my strong points,
[10164.53s -> 10166.45s]  neither, but seeing I do just fine.
[10167.09s -> 10169.41s]  You want to step outside or do a business here?
[10169.41s -> 10170.93s]  I just want him to finish the game.
[10170.93s -> 10172.93s]  Why can't we all just get along?
[10173.81s -> 10175.41s]  These are good men, Arthur.
[10175.41s -> 10176.53s]  They're children of God.
[10177.09s -> 10178.61s]  They are children of God.
[10183.26s -> 10183.74s]  He's down.
[10183.74s -> 10185.02s]  There's a pool of blood under his head.
[10185.02s -> 10185.98s]  Is that fair?
[10185.98s -> 10186.86s]  Fair?
[10186.94s -> 10187.58s]  Sure.
[10188.32s -> 10189.12s]  You want a game?
[10192.51s -> 10192.83s]  Sure.
[10193.47s -> 10194.51s]  I'll play a few hands.
[10194.51s -> 10195.15s]  We're playing.
[10195.15s -> 10197.23s]  Well, sit yourself down then.
[10197.23s -> 10197.79s]  Goldfish.
[10198.67s -> 10207.38s]  Luther, this is Marvin.
[10210.34s -> 10211.06s]  Okay.
[10211.06s -> 10213.62s]  Fortunate for you both we're being gentlemen about this.
[10213.62s -> 10216.26s]  Who has the best hand or bluff for the weaker one?
[10218.85s -> 10221.65s]  So, now you two know each other anyway.
[10222.29s -> 10224.45s]  Don't seem like the likeliest of friends.
[10224.45s -> 10226.21s]  If you don't mind me saying.
[10226.21s -> 10227.41s]  We go a long way back.
[10227.41s -> 10229.89s]  Arthur has a queen and a ten, a promising starting hand.
[10230.69s -> 10232.77s]  I guess it's something like that.
[10232.77s -> 10233.49s]  Can we play?
[10237.49s -> 10239.33s]  He can't be no real clergyman.
[10239.33s -> 10242.61s]  He committed about five cardinal sins just in that chair you're sitting in.
[10243.25s -> 10244.37s]  Think he used to be.
[10245.01s -> 10245.49s]  He's
[10246.75s -> 10247.39s]  community guards.
[10247.39s -> 10249.87s]  It comes to flop and then there comes a river.
[10251.23s -> 10252.67s]  Ooh, look at that.
[10255.60s -> 10257.12s]  Can you imagine him at the pulpit?
[10257.12s -> 10258.24s]  Got a pair.
[10258.24s -> 10258.72s]  Queen pair.
[10258.72s -> 10264.74s]  On the forest day, he turned water whiskey and I don't remember much after that.
[10269.81s -> 10271.97s]  Here comes the turn and then we got the river card.
[10271.97s -> 10274.53s]  He's a decent fella going through now.
[10274.53s -> 10275.09s]  No, no, no, no.
[10275.09s -> 10275.73s]  What if he has it?
[10275.73s -> 10279.33s]  I owe him again and you'll find yourself in a bad time too.
[10279.89s -> 10280.53s]  All right.
[10280.53s -> 10281.01s]  All right.
[10281.01s -> 10282.37s]  Just trying to have a little fun here.
[10283.17s -> 10284.61s]  It is a game after all, Mr.
[10292.43s -> 10293.63s]  In your own time.
[10294.27s -> 10297.39s]  I reckon I'll go all in.
[10298.43s -> 10305.66s]  Oh, I think you're going to regret that call.
[10305.66s -> 10307.58s]  Come on, queen, river queen.
[10308.70s -> 10309.98s]  Oh, I win.
[10309.98s -> 10310.54s]  I win it.
[10310.54s -> 10312.86s]  I win three dollars game over two pair.
[10312.86s -> 10313.26s]  I win.
[10313.26s -> 10313.76s]  Check.
[10322.50s -> 10324.34s]  It's always it always comes down to the river.
[10333.50s -> 10335.02s]  You've unlocked the gambler challenge.
[10335.02s -> 10336.14s]  Check your large for more.
[10336.14s -> 10337.66s]  You lucky son of a bitch.
[10338.30s -> 10339.65s]  I'm doing this shit again.
[10341.70s -> 10342.34s]  All right.
[10342.34s -> 10342.98s]  I'll do one more.
[10346.93s -> 10348.69s]  That was kind of a shitty shuffle though.
[10348.69s -> 10349.33s]  I will tell you.
[10349.33s -> 10349.83s]  Okay.
[10352.45s -> 10353.17s]  Look, look at the aces.
[10353.17s -> 10354.29s]  Look at two pocket aces.
[10367.86s -> 10368.74s]  Get out of here.
[10368.74s -> 10384.61s]  What do we got now?
[10384.61s -> 10385.81s]  You shuffle this time, buddy.
[10386.45s -> 10391.22s]  I must say you have a lot less stories than your friend did.
[10391.22s -> 10392.58s]  Are you lucky or not?
[10392.58s -> 10393.86s]  You ever considered that?
[10394.50s -> 10396.00s]  All right.
[10396.00s -> 10396.88s]  Give me pocket aces.
[10399.90s -> 10400.70s]  Is it three, four?
[10402.26s -> 10402.98s]  Nine queen.
[10402.98s -> 10403.48s]  Okay.
[10419.54s -> 10423.84s]  All right.
[10423.84s -> 10424.40s]  What do we got?
[10426.50s -> 10427.86s]  Well, you should go all in.
[10428.74s -> 10430.69s]  What do we got?
[10431.57s -> 10432.77s]  Now you're talking.
[10432.77s -> 10433.01s]  Okay.
[10433.01s -> 10433.33s]  Hold on.
[10433.33s -> 10434.37s]  We got queen.
[10434.37s -> 10434.85s]  Hold on.
[10435.65s -> 10454.16s]  There we go.
[10454.16s -> 10455.12s]  That's the way it goes.
[10455.68s -> 10456.64s]  Excuse me.
[10456.64s -> 10457.14s]  Shut up.
[10459.82s -> 10461.50s]  I didn't lose that much money.
[10461.50s -> 10465.49s]  This has been quite the eventful day.
[10466.91s -> 10470.51s]  Just not the same without a slurring clergyman, is it?
[10470.51s -> 10471.15s]  Queen six.
[10472.58s -> 10473.54s]  No, I'm not going all in.
[10473.54s -> 10474.04s]  I'll call.
[10478.02s -> 10479.14s]  I'm gonna play slow.
[10479.86s -> 10480.82s]  Oh, come on.
[10480.82s -> 10482.26s]  This ain't kid poker.
[10483.46s -> 10484.58s]  We need the flop to happen here.
[10485.38s -> 10488.19s]  Come on.
[10488.19s -> 10488.75s]  Deal it out.
[10492.74s -> 10493.62s]  Five, four.
[10493.62s -> 10494.02s]  What do we got?
[10494.02s -> 10494.74s]  What do we got?
[10495.54s -> 10495.86s]  Six.
[10497.04s -> 10499.52s]  We got four, five, six, seven.
[10499.52s -> 10500.72s]  We need a seven.
[10500.72s -> 10503.07s]  We need seven.
[10503.07s -> 10511.30s]  Come on, man.
[10511.30s -> 10517.17s]  Some time before we all grow old.
[10517.17s -> 10518.45s]  Let's be brave.
[10518.45s -> 10521.10s]  Give us seven.
[10521.74s -> 10522.46s]  Okay now.
[10524.00s -> 10524.72s]  Oh, fuck.
[10524.72s -> 10524.96s]  Okay.
[10524.96s -> 10525.92s]  Seems it's us again.
[10526.64s -> 10527.68s]  Close one.
[10527.68s -> 10528.66s]  Give us a seven.
[10529.38s -> 10529.78s]  Straight.
[10530.50s -> 10531.68s]  Do it.
[10544.27s -> 10545.23s]  Robbed there for real.
[10547.28s -> 10548.32s]  No, I'm not going to shoot him.
[10548.88s -> 10550.00s]  I'm going to come all the way back.
[10556.53s -> 10562.72s]  No, he's didn't.
[10562.72s -> 10562.88s]  Okay.
[10562.88s -> 10563.52s]  I didn't want to do that.
[10563.52s -> 10563.68s]  Okay.
[10563.68s -> 10564.00s]  Go ahead.
[10564.00s -> 10564.50s]  Okay.
[10565.04s -> 10565.28s]  King.
[10569.89s -> 10571.30s]  Follow.
[10571.30s -> 10571.94s]  Good.
[10571.94s -> 10574.72s]  Let's start this low for now.
[10575.68s -> 10579.30s]  14.
[10580.16s -> 10589.34s]  Give us a full house.
[10592.32s -> 10593.36s]  Don't do this to me again.
[10596.21s -> 10596.71s]  King.
[10597.57s -> 10611.49s]  Yeah, I know.
[10611.49s -> 10612.37s]  Pretty pathetic.
[10614.61s -> 10615.11s]  Ten.
[10619.07s -> 10619.57s]  Ten.
[10621.04s -> 10621.54s]  Ten.
[10622.70s -> 10623.20s]  No.
[10623.82s -> 10630.03s]  Forgive me.
[10630.11s -> 10631.23s]  That's all I can afford.
[10636.54s -> 10637.04s]  Ten.
[10643.25s -> 10644.53s]  Oh, you want to check that?
[10646.22s -> 10646.72s]  All in.
[10647.81s -> 10648.53s]  What is this?
[10649.92s -> 10651.52s]  No, you fucking lose, buddy.
[10651.52s -> 10653.28s]  It's ain't what you call finishing strong.
[10653.28s -> 10654.72s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[10654.72s -> 10655.36s]  Got the ten.
[10656.00s -> 10657.44s]  Not much I can do about that.
[10658.08s -> 10658.58s]  Okay.
[10659.36s -> 10661.68s]  So we're back in the game now.
[10665.52s -> 10666.02s]  See?
[10666.32s -> 10667.66s]  What do I got for money?
[10667.66s -> 10668.54s]  What do they come in here with?
[10668.54s -> 10669.98s]  Are you kidding me?
[10669.98s -> 10671.42s]  I just got to win two more hands, right?
[10672.22s -> 10673.58s]  Now I'm just going to play it safe
[10673.58s -> 10674.70s]  and I'm going to just win two hands
[10674.70s -> 10675.42s]  and get the achievement.
[10678.03s -> 10680.19s]  The people we've met at this table.
[10680.19s -> 10681.55s]  Can you win without a straight?
[10681.55s -> 10683.39s]  I hope your friend's still breathing.
[10683.39s -> 10684.51s]  He's very quiet.
[10684.51s -> 10685.39s]  You can win with a pair
[10685.95s -> 10686.91s]  if nobody has anything.
[10689.01s -> 10690.69s]  Two ten is not...
[10690.69s -> 10691.19s]  Yup.
[10692.69s -> 10693.81s]  I mean, they could get like a pair.
[10693.81s -> 10694.77s]  I'd give it two pair though.
[10697.60s -> 10699.20s]  Not just a little wager.
[10699.92s -> 10700.42s]  Okay.
[10711.17s -> 10713.17s]  Well, if somebody has a six
[10713.17s -> 10714.77s]  then it's just unfolding here.
[10716.27s -> 10717.07s]  That's too dangerous.
[10720.08s -> 10720.58s]  Right?
[10720.58s -> 10721.76s]  This is just...
[10721.76s -> 10722.56s]  Yeah, this is it.
[10722.56s -> 10723.06s]  Come on.
[10724.26s -> 10726.82s]  Jesus, you play like my grandmother.
[10726.82s -> 10727.94s]  When do you guys get a fucking six
[10727.94s -> 10728.50s]  as the game's over?
[10731.06s -> 10732.02s]  Okay, whatever.
[10732.02s -> 10733.22s]  That was two pair.
[10733.22s -> 10734.02s]  That was two pair
[10734.02s -> 10735.22s]  and I shouldn't have fold.
[10735.22s -> 10736.66s]  But if somebody has a six, we'll see.
[10737.70s -> 10738.58s]  That was two pair.
[10739.30s -> 10740.23s]  What do you got?
[10743.49s -> 10745.16s]  Check.
[10745.16s -> 10745.80s]  Can't check.
[10746.60s -> 10747.40s]  I thought I was going to...
[10748.20s -> 10749.96s]  Sorry to do this, fellas.
[10749.96s -> 10750.68s]  He got a six.
[10750.68s -> 10751.32s]  See?
[10751.32s -> 10752.68s]  I would have fucking lost.
[10752.68s -> 10754.28s]  I folded at the right time.
[10754.28s -> 10755.80s]  It was the correct play.
[10755.80s -> 10757.24s]  If you were sitting at the poker table
[10757.24s -> 10758.52s]  you would have had to do the same thing.
[10759.40s -> 10763.91s]  Okay.
[10765.51s -> 10769.27s]  Guys, I've made like 10 grand playing poker.
[10770.07s -> 10772.23s]  Now granted I've also lost 40 grand.
[10772.79s -> 10774.87s]  But I've won 10 grand before.
[10783.60s -> 10784.72s]  What do we got?
[10784.72s -> 10785.44s]  Clean three.
[10786.24s -> 10787.36s]  Well, I just need to put a couple...
[10787.36s -> 10787.86s]  Come on.
[10788.68s -> 10789.00s]  All right.
[10789.00s -> 10789.72s]  Well, that's fine.
[10790.44s -> 10792.10s]  That's like...
[10792.10s -> 10793.30s]  Let's fuck them up a little bit here.
[10793.30s -> 10794.10s]  Let's break them up.
[10797.64s -> 10801.88s]  Give me...
[10801.88s -> 10802.76s]  Give me a two pair here.
[10806.74s -> 10807.38s]  There's the three.
[10808.18s -> 10809.83s]  That's a pair right there.
[10810.47s -> 10814.42s]  Just need a queen.
[10815.06s -> 10816.15s]  Oh, and another three.
[10818.21s -> 10819.33s]  That ain't too exciting.
[10820.42s -> 10821.22s]  Good.
[10821.22s -> 10822.66s]  I'll call it.
[10822.66s -> 10823.46s]  Just give me a queen or a three.
[10823.46s -> 10823.96s]  Come on.
[10824.34s -> 10825.14s]  Give me three of a kind.
[10825.70s -> 10832.16s]  I don't think I'm going to win.
[10832.16s -> 10833.12s]  This is a pair of threes.
[10839.11s -> 10839.99s]  And another check.
[10840.63s -> 10841.83s]  Why don't that surprise me?
[10842.55s -> 10843.05s]  Fuck.
[10846.32s -> 10847.84s]  Come on.
[10847.84s -> 10848.80s]  River's going to be like a three.
[10848.80s -> 10849.92s]  River's going to be a queen or a three.
[10850.96s -> 10852.71s]  He doesn't have his three.
[10853.75s -> 10854.31s]  Oh, fuck.
[10854.31s -> 10855.27s]  Now maybe he does.
[10857.27s -> 10861.16s]  I could win this with a pair.
[10861.16s -> 10861.48s]  Screw it.
[10861.48s -> 10862.12s]  With three.
[10863.08s -> 10863.72s]  He's bluffing.
[10863.72s -> 10864.92s]  This is bullshit.
[10864.92s -> 10865.96s]  Eighty-four cents.
[10872.84s -> 10873.40s]  Ace high.
[10875.81s -> 10876.61s]  Pair of threes.
[10876.61s -> 10877.49s]  Pair of sevens.
[10877.49s -> 10878.21s]  God damn it.
[10882.69s -> 10883.25s]  I would have won.
[10883.25s -> 10884.29s]  I would have won.
[10884.29s -> 10885.01s]  That would have been it.
[10892.52s -> 10893.16s]  I just got to...
[10893.16s -> 10893.80s]  Oh, look.
[10893.80s -> 10894.52s]  I can come back.
[10894.52s -> 10895.24s]  I can come back.
[10895.24s -> 10896.12s]  Just give me a few more minutes.
[10896.12s -> 10897.72s]  Just give me like another hour or two.
[10897.72s -> 10898.36s]  I can come back.
[10904.98s -> 10905.94s]  I'm just going to run to the ATM.
[10905.94s -> 10906.50s]  I'll be back in like...
[10906.50s -> 10907.54s]  I'm just going to get like another $400.
[10908.42s -> 10912.28s]  Queen six.
[10912.28s -> 10913.64s]  Why do I have a queen every time?
[10913.64s -> 10914.28s]  Is this rigged?
[10915.08s -> 10917.14s]  Seriously.
[10917.14s -> 10917.62s]  Is this rigged?
[10917.62s -> 10919.78s]  Do I have a queen fucking every hand?
[10924.44s -> 10931.13s]  Flip him.
[10951.65s -> 10952.15s]  Damn it.
[10957.08s -> 10958.36s]  I'm trying to fluff him up.
[10960.60s -> 10961.16s]  Come on.
[10962.36s -> 10962.86s]  No.
[10968.90s -> 10970.18s]  How do I go to the ATM?
[10972.24s -> 10974.16s]  This is getting too rich for me.
[10974.16s -> 10974.88s]  Sit down.
[10976.08s -> 10976.56s]  I'll be right back.
[10976.56s -> 10978.08s]  I'm just going to go to my horse.
[10978.08s -> 10979.28s]  I'm going to get my debit card.
[10979.28s -> 10980.08s]  Come on, Rip.
[10980.08s -> 10983.43s]  Where'd he go?
[10983.43s -> 10983.93s]  Who?
[10988.02s -> 10989.14s]  Excuse me, gentlemen.
[10992.26s -> 10994.18s]  The tutorial AI never holds.
[10995.70s -> 11002.18s]  Who's the stranger?
[11002.74s -> 11005.28s]  Excuse me.
[11005.28s -> 11006.00s]  I'm sorry.
[11006.00s -> 11008.88s]  You see a drunken idiot priest wandering about?
[11015.12s -> 11016.16s]  It wasn't done.
[11016.16s -> 11017.28s]  It wasn't done.
[11017.28s -> 11017.78s]  Hey.
[11018.48s -> 11026.26s]  I'm just screaming for him.
[11031.73s -> 11033.09s]  God damn it.
[11033.09s -> 11034.45s]  I'm not trying to kill anybody.
[11036.07s -> 11037.11s]  Jesus Christ.
[11040.16s -> 11040.66s]  What?
[11046.61s -> 11047.11s]  Find him.
[11051.52s -> 11052.08s]  Who is this?
[11060.72s -> 11061.28s]  Who?
[11061.28s -> 11080.71s]  He's still alive.
[11102.23s -> 11103.27s]  He's still alive.
[11104.68s -> 11107.24s]  This guy is a fucking super human.
[11123.12s -> 11123.62s]  Okay.
[11124.90s -> 11125.94s]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[11135.30s -> 11136.66s]  No, get the sheep out of the way.
[11137.38s -> 11142.44s]  Come here.
[11142.44s -> 11142.68s]  Come here.
[11142.68s -> 11143.18s]  Come here.
[11143.64s -> 11158.34s]  Live spirit.
[11159.30s -> 11165.04s]  Is he going to the train?
[11171.65s -> 11172.53s]  What is he doing?
[11174.66s -> 11175.62s]  I can't jump that high.
[11179.92s -> 11181.04s]  What the fuck is he doing?
[11199.72s -> 11200.44s]  The train's not coming.
[11200.44s -> 11200.94s]  We're fine.
[11207.36s -> 11207.60s]  All right.
[11207.60s -> 11208.10s]  Come here.
[11213.68s -> 11214.64s]  Oh, the train's right there.
[11222.52s -> 11223.24s]  All right, got him.
[11223.24s -> 11223.74s]  Come on.
[11232.53s -> 11233.73s]  What the hell did you do, man?
[11241.99s -> 11243.75s]  That was just the heavy from TF2.
[11243.75s -> 11247.64s]  What the hell is wrong with you throwing me bridge like that?
[11247.64s -> 11250.60s]  There was a goddamn train, you crazy bastard.
[11252.04s -> 11255.01s]  Have I been bad again, Mr. Morgan?
[11256.05s -> 11257.01s]  I'm sorry.
[11259.57s -> 11262.02s]  We're just different.
[11269.52s -> 11272.00s]  Good on you for not doing the cheap YouTuber joke.
[11272.00s -> 11272.50s]  Home.
[11273.04s -> 11273.54s]  Yeah.
[11274.48s -> 11275.68s]  Yeah, I mean, come on.

[11279.12s -> 11279.44s]  Margaret.
[11279.44s -> 11280.16s]  Who's Margaret?
[11281.52s -> 11294.26s]  Yeah, y'all thought of...
[11302.60s -> 11306.60s]  By the way, those of you that have very keen ears, I pressed R2.
[11307.32s -> 11315.04s]  Let me try.
[11315.04s -> 11315.52s]  Yeah, I know.
[11319.12s -> 11319.62s]  Yeah.
[11344.96s -> 11345.60s]  No, drop.
[11349.16s -> 11352.84s]  What a classic.
[11352.84s -> 11354.36s]  It's a classic one, you know?
[11361.51s -> 11362.23s]  One more time.
[11362.23s -> 11364.63s]  Dude, it's a classic funny YouTube joke.
[11364.63s -> 11365.13s]  Come on.
[11365.85s -> 11368.04s]  We fell off on the...
[11368.04s -> 11368.68s]  What the heck?
[11371.08s -> 11376.47s]  You have to do it for the YouTube joke.
[11393.35s -> 11394.39s]  No, I'm not doing it.
[11400.26s -> 11407.11s]  Told you I wasn't gonna do it.
[11407.75s -> 11414.89s]  Just bail on the last second.
[11414.89s -> 11416.49s]  No, no, we can't do that anymore.
[11416.49s -> 11418.81s]  There's way more funny, interesting things to do than...
[11418.81s -> 11420.17s]  Look, I fell off the cliff again.
[11421.37s -> 11421.87s]  You know?
[11424.55s -> 11433.51s]  Wait for the train to go through the length of the entire map and then get hit by it.
[11434.23s -> 11450.79s]  To do any of this.
[11450.79s -> 11451.67s]  Here comes another one.
[11451.67s -> 11452.63s]  Don't need to do this.
[11456.70s -> 11457.82s]  He's coming without him.
[11465.43s -> 11466.07s]  Hey, hey!
[11469.75s -> 11471.03s]  Is he out cold?
[11471.03s -> 11472.15s]  I think he's knocked out.
[11473.11s -> 11475.35s]  I think it ran over his head.
[11477.67s -> 11478.71s]  I think he's dead.
[11480.60s -> 11481.24s]  Is he dead?
[11481.24s -> 11482.84s]  Don't mind if I'm dead.
[11482.84s -> 11483.48s]  He isn't.
[11483.48s -> 11483.98s]  Okay.
[11486.79s -> 11487.59s]  He hit a horse.
[11487.75s -> 11489.03s]  Oh, hello, sirs.
[11492.86s -> 11494.70s]  Oh, he got in an accident.
[11496.28s -> 11497.72s]  Hello, it's a fatty!
[11498.52s -> 11508.67s]  Let's hitch.
[11514.42s -> 11515.14s]  All right, Reverend.
[11515.78s -> 11517.74s]  What do you think?
[11518.76s -> 11523.29s]  Where's it going?
[11523.29s -> 11524.09s]  Where are you going with him?
[11537.98s -> 11538.94s]  Drop off in bed.
[11539.82s -> 11543.78s]  I am babysitting this guy, huh?
[11546.95s -> 11547.91s]  Just leave him on the horse?
[11547.91s -> 11550.07s]  Can I put him on the horse and then put the horse in bed?
[11555.77s -> 11556.33s]  No.
[11556.33s -> 11557.13s]  Drop in fire.
[11557.13s -> 11557.85s]  That's not gonna happen.
[11558.41s -> 11559.13s]  Drop off cliff.
[11559.13s -> 11559.77s]  Not gonna happen.
[11563.08s -> 11567.30s]  You better sleep your way to salvation, my friend.
[11568.90s -> 11570.18s]  What happened?
[11570.18s -> 11572.34s]  Just the usual.
[11572.34s -> 11573.62s]  Poor bastard.
[11573.62s -> 11574.74s]  Exactly.
[11574.74s -> 11576.50s]  Well, thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[11576.50s -> 11578.18s]  I'll keep an eye on him.
[11578.82s -> 11580.10s]  Comedy license revoked.
[11580.10s -> 11580.58s]  He was lucky this time.
[11581.78s -> 11582.34s]  Real lucky.
[11588.68s -> 11589.48s]  All right.
[11589.48s -> 11591.27s]  Who is not without sin completed?
[11593.72s -> 11594.22s]  Donation.
[11594.76s -> 11596.87s]  Let's get it to 100 bucks.
[11597.51s -> 11630.28s]  A companion activity is available in the camp.
[11630.28s -> 11631.56s]  Talk to companions marked on your map.
[11636.47s -> 11637.19s]  Where?
[11637.19s -> 11638.23s]  Companion activity?
[11638.79s -> 11641.37s]  It's now marked on the map.
[11641.37s -> 11641.61s]  What?
[11641.61s -> 11642.33s]  Which one opened up?
[11650.15s -> 11651.75s]  Five finger fillet with Lenny.
[11653.70s -> 11654.58s]  Not this shit again.
[11663.53s -> 11665.61s]  I couldn't do this before because it was an Xbox controller, though.
[11669.96s -> 11670.36s]  Remember?
[11671.74s -> 11672.54s]  I should be fine.
[11675.94s -> 11676.44s]  Lenny?
[11676.90s -> 11677.62s]  Hey, Arthur.
[11677.62s -> 11679.70s]  That knife's sharp enough, ain't it?
[11679.70s -> 11680.66s]  Depends.
[11680.66s -> 11681.30s]  Why?
[11681.30s -> 11682.10s]  You feel lucky?
[11682.66s -> 11683.14s]  Do you?
[11683.86s -> 11684.90s]  Before me?
[11684.90s -> 11687.46s]  At least six generations were born and changed.
[11687.46s -> 11688.74s]  And for the last three years,
[11688.74s -> 11692.66s]  I've been running from every lawman and bounty hunter west of the Lanahassee River.
[11693.22s -> 11695.22s]  So yeah, I feel lucky.
[11695.22s -> 11696.98s]  I'm the living embodiment of luck.
[11696.98s -> 11698.90s]  That is one way of seeing things.
[11698.90s -> 11700.26s]  But I'm also skill.
[11700.90s -> 11701.70s]  And in this game,
[11701.70s -> 11702.26s]  I think I'll be all right here.
[11702.26s -> 11705.30s]  You've got to have luck and skill.
[11705.30s -> 11706.82s]  And stupidity.
[11706.82s -> 11708.18s]  The outlaw's trinity.
[11708.82s -> 11711.22s]  Luck, skill, and just a dose of stupidity.
[11711.22s -> 11711.94s]  Come on.
[11711.94s -> 11714.82s]  You ain't too loyal and too sly just yet.
[11714.82s -> 11715.54s]  After you.
[11715.54s -> 11716.26s]  As you wish.
[11716.98s -> 11721.46s]  You know, we should head back up that mountain sometime and make Jenny a proper grade.
[11721.46s -> 11722.18s]  Okay, who's turning?
[11722.18s -> 11722.68s]  So nice.
[11723.54s -> 11724.02s]  Don't worry.
[11724.02s -> 11725.06s]  Does this work just like the other one?
[11725.06s -> 11726.66s]  I'll send a wire to the doctor for you.
[11726.66s -> 11727.62s]  Oh, he just cut his hand.
[11735.00s -> 11736.44s]  Oh, he's setting the time I have to beat.
[11737.16s -> 11743.16s]  Here goes.
[11753.72s -> 11755.83s]  Got it.
[11755.83s -> 11756.95s]  Keep it loose.
[11756.95s -> 11761.00s]  What are the buttons here?
[11761.00s -> 11762.76s]  Okay, it's X triangle, so it's triangle.
[11763.48s -> 11764.36s]  So it's X triangle.
[11764.36s -> 11764.92s]  X triangle.
[11764.92s -> 11766.28s]  I'll do it like in five seconds.

[11786.92s -> 11789.32s]  Okay, just X square, X square, X square, X square, X square.
[11794.26s -> 11795.78s]  No other variables here.
[11801.11s -> 11801.83s]  Record time here.
[11801.83s -> 11802.31s]  Watch this.
[11822.42s -> 11823.38s]  Now we go on round two.

[12998.20s -> 13008.66s]  run up in the mountains east of cumberland this is quick i just hope i can remember how to get there
[13009.38s -> 13016.38s]  back into the mountains i sure didn't figure on that but this time we're doing the chasing i
[13016.38s -> 13023.90s]  fucking hate the tail why so how are things with you what's wrong with it i mean it looks
[13023.98s -> 13025.98s]  kind of like a scorpion tail but that's fine
[13037.98s -> 13043.98s]  the tail is fine it just looks like there's a snake up its ass
[13057.06s -> 13058.50s]  if it dies i lose it forever
[13060.02s -> 13062.90s]  well then that's very good reason for me to keep it alive
[13068.44s -> 13087.43s]  long hair it's the color not the braid get gold okay time to go i think we need to head right
[13087.43s -> 13102.18s]  up here we're gonna go up all the way up yes i remember i'm not in control anymore am i
[13102.26s -> 13118.25s]  moonstone pond what's what's wrong with my golden tail red hair do i prefer flathead
[13118.25s -> 13124.36s]  screwdrivers or phillips well depends on what the scenario is we made it let's loop around
[13124.36s -> 13136.34s]  the other side you can't have a favorite screwdriver depends on how big it is here
[13136.34s -> 13140.90s]  you know this this screwdriver is a phillips head i can't undo my table without a phillips
[13140.90s -> 13146.09s]  head might as well go get a flathead no i mean phillips head definitely is cooler but
[13147.05s -> 13163.99s]  did i do cinematic centrist streamer is scared to take a side maybe we should catch one to cook
[13163.99s -> 13170.95s]  sure try and shoot one you don't want to use anything too powerful on a small animal like that
[13170.95s -> 13174.23s]  just ruin the meat you can probably put a paint can with a flathead
[13176.55s -> 13189.78s]  you can probably put a paint can with a hammer as well slow down well there they all are i did
[13189.78s -> 13213.83s]  i thought thought we were still in a cut scene why don't they just i got one
[13223.78s -> 13227.86s]  not very smart rabbits i will say you are correct on that
[13232.54s -> 13241.06s]  yep good job all right getting late that's it we should camp here oh i thought we were
[13241.06s -> 13258.38s]  going home yeah that's it get us set up well i'm finished cook that rabbit then
[13259.10s -> 13264.46s]  they're delicious on an open fire like this just like monster hunter right to spin it
[13265.34s -> 13270.47s]  i ever had been in this menu it's just teaching me how to be in the menu
[13271.74s -> 13288.87s]  and cook six of this plain game let's go can i burn it you want something no i'm fine
[13288.87s -> 13296.20s]  i don't like eating this late okay what after all that so i'm gonna eat a whole rabbit
[13296.20s -> 13316.76s]  myself i guess i probably could do that i could probably eat a whole rabbit put this one away
[13322.12s -> 13335.42s]  rabbits are 30 pounds are you sure about that no they're not 30 pounds is is like a medium-sized
[13335.42s -> 13348.28s]  dog a rabbit is like maybe two pounds this isn't a shibu inu what do they call
[13350.36s -> 13364.65s]  shiba shiba inu a rabbit is how many pounds is a rabbit siri how many pounds is a rabbit
[13364.65s -> 13376.02s]  how much does a rabbit weigh how much does a rabbit weigh okay let's see ranging from
[13376.02s -> 13385.19s]  adult domestic rabbits can have a healthy weight ranging from two to eleven pounds two pounds
[13385.19s -> 13401.18s]  eleven pounds that's huge that's a hair that's not even a rabbit first like to find this
[13401.18s -> 13410.47s]  monster choose a time to sleep until sleep until morning he better be worth all this drama
[13410.47s -> 13432.41s]  eleven pound absolute unit rabbit five five five you ready no give me a minute coffee sure there
[13432.41s -> 13442.94s]  you go so what's your plan well we'll see if we can track them but we might need to lay
[13442.94s -> 13447.10s]  bait to draw them out i want one of those cups obviously but they all can you get one
[13447.10s -> 13451.42s]  of those one of those old school tin cups i'll drink out of that every day shoot from the
[13451.50s -> 13456.94s]  trees but i prefer to hunt on the ground more dangerous but we'll have a much better
[13456.94s -> 13462.22s]  chance of getting good shot in and if he bolts we can start right off after him why is my
[13462.22s -> 13468.14s]  author arthur santa because halloween was yesterday and now we've gone it's christmas time tie it
[13468.14s -> 13475.24s]  up in that rag when you're done i hope you know what you're talking about i grew up in the
[13477.11s -> 13479.35s]  predator bait select the potent predator bait recipe
[13482.55s -> 13490.58s]  that was virtually weaned on bear meat okay i think i got this done good pack up and we'll
[13490.58s -> 13508.07s]  get going i gotta shave what's the hold okay let's go so how are we gonna take down we're
[13508.07s -> 13513.18s]  gonna bait them this is my horse okay yeah i can always tell
[13514.86s -> 13523.50s]  okay how's that horse treating you so far so good you know i was in this area with bessie
[13523.50s -> 13532.89s]  years ago really i don't i imagine you still miss her every day did you two ever
[13532.89s -> 13538.09s]  think about getting out fix the audio hold wait is it really like an audio sinking problem
[13538.09s -> 13543.72s]  right now or am i getting yelled at for no reason you should be hearing like don't don't
[13543.72s -> 13561.77s]  don't don't don't don't do a test with a gun this is a better test right when you see the
[13561.77s -> 13574.87s]  highlight it should go it's a half second behind it wasn't it normal at the beginning of the
[13574.87s -> 13601.91s]  stream the audio is playing first hold on let me try this that's weird tell me if this fixes
[13601.91s -> 13620.49s]  it already i wonder why that happened that's weird because it wasn't doing that in the
[13620.49s -> 13624.89s]  beginning i don't know why why i'm just desyncing after playing for like three or four hours it's
[13624.89s -> 13638.81s]  weird okay let's go now we did briefly you don't remember guess you were still young i had my
[13638.81s -> 13645.21s]  sound off how would you know there was a problem she understood she knew what i was
[13645.85s -> 13654.42s]  i've been around for a while things were looser back then truth is there's never really any
[13654.82s -> 13660.98s]  out the audio is at the wrong angle i gotta like tilt my audio you know that but bessie and i
[13660.98s -> 13668.84s]  made it work you thinking about getting out hey no of course not you can braid your horse's tail
[13668.84s -> 13673.64s]  yep duchess grand plans work and you can paint it gold we can make enough money to go someplace
[13673.64s -> 13681.72s]  new really new maybe we can all have a new start anyway for now let's try and chase ourselves
