[0.89s -> 21.11s]  Stop punching me. Don't punch me. Don't punch me. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good to see you again. Get him.
[28.30s -> 32.22s]  I got a little froggy in my throat. Trying to get rid of him.
[35.80s -> 42.98s]  I can't. It's still there. Why? You're a noisy streamer. Hold on. This is why I've been sitting
[42.98s -> 70.71s]  here clearing my throat for like five- Okay, I'm back. That took long enough. Today, from the title
[70.71s -> 74.55s]  of the stream, you probably see we're gonna be playing Connect again. We're going back to it.
[75.11s -> 84.22s]  We're gonna start with one of the most popular fucking frog in my throat. We're gonna start
[84.22s -> 90.25s]  with one of the most popular frogs. The guy that goes, hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my
[90.25s -> 96.58s]  ragtime gal. I don't even know what his name is. He's probably the most popular frog, right?
[97.67s -> 105.51s]  Slippy Toad? Who's the most famous frog ever? Oh, Curret the Frog, right. Don't turn off by 360.
[105.51s -> 107.83s]  What are you talking about? If you're having trouble, don't turn off the 360. No, don't turn
[107.83s -> 114.31s]  off my 360. Okay, we're good. I thought my 360 just almost auto-powered down.
[119.35s -> 123.75s]  All right, hi. I'm just gonna- I don't- Here, look. I have to do this so I can get out of the
[123.75s -> 136.86s]  fucking way. We're starting. Hi. Oh, it's screaming at me. I got my wireless Bluetooth headphones.
[137.50s -> 151.10s]  Streamer alert? What's going on with the hair? And I don't- Okay.
[152.33s -> 160.94s]  I don't- My lighting in my room sucks. And this camera sucks. It's a horrible combo. I have one
[160.94s -> 166.23s]  recessed light right here that beams down an interrogation light. And then I have, like,
[166.87s -> 174.17s]  one of those Walmart Logitech webcams. All of them suck. Wait, hold on. Did you see my hands?
[174.73s -> 181.26s]  Even the expensive Logitech webcams, they're all- They're fucking terrible.
[181.26s -> 188.58s]  What ha- What the fuck? And they have, like, oh, the Logitech C29, the C40, the C920,
[188.58s -> 195.29s]  the C, the C- What are all these fucking webcams that all are terrible? Why do they all look like
[195.29s -> 210.46s]  this? Anyways. Anyways. All right, I'm still in a fucking really weird mood. It didn't leave
[211.18s -> 217.26s]  from yesterday. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I think it's like the- the- the-
[217.26s -> 222.70s]  when the weather gets, like, a little better and nicer. Like, it's a reverse, like, full moon.
[224.04s -> 228.84s]  I- I like it more weird as the- as, like, the spring comes in. I'm like a fucking flower.
[230.68s -> 236.57s]  Anyways. We're gonna play Connectimals right now. We gotta test something first, though.
[236.57s -> 250.04s]  Where are you? There you are. You ready? I'm gonna put my finger up. Ready? One! One! One! That's not
[250.04s -> 262.22s]  right. It's a little delayed. I gotta go more delayed, right? Well, here's the problem. It's
[262.22s -> 272.98s]  delayed from me to the Connect. And then it's delayed from you to the stream. I see myself,
[272.98s -> 276.18s]  then it goes. See myself, then it goes. All right, I get it delayed a little more. Hold on.
[276.82s -> 300.17s]  It's a double delay, Andy. I know. Why's my room red? 750 delayed. Try that. Here we go, right? Pretty
[300.17s -> 320.02s]  good. One. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. A little more. 800. I need a little more. More power.
[320.02s -> 339.67s]  800. Get it to 800 power. Try that. Sweep. Why do people cast like this, like, when they cast spells?
[339.67s -> 345.85s]  Just go like that. You ever think about that? In every, like, RPG and every fucking fantasy
[345.85s -> 350.97s]  thing, why do they have to do weird casts? Just fucking point and say fireball. Why is it like
[351.93s -> 364.73s]  fire? No, just go. That's so much easier. Fireball! Why go like this? That's fucking stupid.
[364.73s -> 377.86s]  What were we doing? All right. Sweep. Sweep. Go. Yes. I think we're good. You guys ready?
[378.42s -> 392.89s]  Because it's cool. Did you see my belly button just come up? All right. You ready? You ready?
[392.89s -> 401.88s]  Everybody? I'm just fucking connected up. This is Connectimals. This game's probably not good.
[402.60s -> 414.12s]  Here we go. I'm calibrated. Ah, welcome to the world of Connectimals. Did Peter Molyneux make
[414.12s -> 420.17s]  this game? Peter Molyneux made this game, right? Oh, no, he made another one with, like, a little
[420.17s -> 429.86s]  boy. What happened? What happened? This thing freaked out. What happened? What happened? What
[429.86s -> 454.49s]  just happened? What's going on? Wave to connect. Please face the sender. Sensor. I need a controller.
[454.49s -> 466.20s]  What the fuck are you doing? What? What did I press? Hold on. What did I press? Oh, it wants
[466.20s -> 473.85s]  sign in with your email. Fuck you. I don't even- I have no idea what that is. Holy shit, I have
[473.85s -> 483.08s]  absolutely no idea what this is. I have no idea what my password is. I'm just gonna be David
[483.08s -> 495.48s]  instead. Yeah, who cares? I have absolutely no idea. All right, David. We're gonna be logging
[496.12s -> 505.99s]  as David. He doesn't have Xbox live. It's like my little brother. Okay, let's go. We're David.
[506.63s -> 522.28s]  So this one's now with bears. Why does it have to be so far away? I'm just getting closer. I don't care.
[523.64s -> 529.88s]  Hello, and welcome to the island. To get started, put your arm out and hover over the start button.
[530.76s -> 545.83s]  That's Invader Zim. That's Invader Zim. Uh, what's his name? I know it. Richard. Richard what?
[545.83s -> 562.89s]  What's his name? Oh, I don't care about signing in. Fuck off. Richard Horvitz. There he is. Wait,
[562.89s -> 576.04s]  I'm not David though. Oh shit, I just stole David's identity. Guest. Select bear adventure. Um,
[576.04s -> 580.78s]  I think I don't want to do regular connectibles. To start, put out your hand and swipe it in front
[580.78s -> 585.26s]  of you like this. I like the way this camera is, by the way. It's a bad camera position. We need to
[585.26s -> 603.98s]  spring this. What the fuck did I just do? What did I do? Did I pick bear adventure?
[605.40s -> 622.41s]  Oh, there they are. Wolf den. I picked bear adventure. Should I do the first one first?
[623.45s -> 639.82s]  Why is my room red? You're a Satanist.
[639.82s -> 641.82s]  You're a curious looking pirate. Where's your house?
[641.82s -> 658.62s]  Whoa, 3D. Don't you our eyes be an explorer, yes? Well, you've certainly discovered something here.
[658.62s -> 665.85s]  Welcome to the island. Get out of here, you little fucking weirdo. But please come. Everybody will
[665.85s -> 670.33s]  want to meet you. We haven't seen anyone since the captains left on their expedition.
[670.33s -> 674.41s]  I didn't want to do this one. It's a sacred place. We call it the bonding circle.
[674.41s -> 678.62s]  It's where- I wanted to do the regular game. Where is everybody? Being shy.
[679.18s -> 683.86s]  No need to be shy, little one. Should I go back? Come on. It's where cubs start their
[683.86s -> 693.75s]  bond with their human companions. Okay. Should I do the bear adventure? Does it matter? Which
[693.75s -> 705.99s]  one's better? What? The bonding circle. What? We'll play the default game. All right. I'll
[705.99s -> 713.35s]  play this for five minutes and then I'm going back. Oh, this is back when like loading screens
[713.35s -> 716.55s]  were a majority of like the 12 hours of the game. It was like four hours.
[718.04s -> 722.74s]  Which one? Which should I pick? Whatever you're not sure what to do,
[722.74s -> 733.43s]  just follow me and do what I do. Okay. I could panda bear. Hold out your hand like this. I don't
[733.43s -> 737.64s]  hope. No, I don't want the panda bear though. Hold out your hand and swipe it in front of you.
[741.53s -> 745.69s]  That's it. Now, if you swipe with your left hand, you can look at the cubs to your left.
[747.03s -> 754.98s]  Go ahead. Left and right to me. Why can't I just turn my body? All right. So we got- that's-
[754.98s -> 761.96s]  we got brown bear, black bear. All right. Hold on. Grizzly bear. Grizzly bear is very cute.
[764.41s -> 770.09s]  Black bear. Black bear is like little dogs. All you have to do is put your hand out in front of
[770.09s -> 774.65s]  you. Don't worry. Oh, no panda or polar bear. Don't these- don't- aren't these mean-
[780.23s -> 788.36s]  Fucking connect is- is stupid. Go ahead. Reach out with both your hands and give it a good pet.
[788.36s -> 796.54s]  I guess we have a fucking polar bear. Oh, he's such a good boy. Left and right to move parts of
[796.54s -> 810.30s]  its body. He's so cute. Step left and right. I don't want a pet there. What the fuck? Oh,
[810.38s -> 822.73s]  polar bear. This cub is one of my favorites. No. Good. We can go somewhere else. What's this one?
[822.73s -> 835.51s]  Honey bear? A poo bear? A cinnamon bear? Hold on. I need to see the cinnamon bear. Oh, this is the
[835.51s -> 847.90s]  bear that's on all the cereal boxes. I like this one. How are you? Oh, he looks like a little fox.
[857.50s -> 864.54s]  I'm like down here. Down here. He just like shits in my hand. Oh, it's okay. It's all right.
[865.26s -> 874.58s]  Promise me you won't name it cinnamon. They really don't like that. Yes. That'd have been bear.
[875.30s -> 885.19s]  Karma, what the fuck? What? Oh, they just bit me. Oh, they are bears. Do you want to give your new
[885.19s -> 894.74s]  friend a name right now? Yes. Should we name him? I think it's time we gave your little one a name,
[894.74s -> 911.46s]  don't you? Say it out loud. Snuggles the first of his name. Snuggles the bear. Dryer sheet bear.
[912.89s -> 922.54s]  Dryer sheet. Do I have to press the button? Dryer sheet bear.
[931.14s -> 965.59s]  Dryer sheet bear. Dryer sheet bear. Oh, he loves it. I have to say that every time. He loves it.
[966.98s -> 975.06s]  Picture or something to identify this. Scan a picture. No. Like on my fucking printer. Looks
[975.06s -> 979.38s]  like you're ready to go see where you'll be staying while on the island. I have to go scan an image
[979.38s -> 997.34s]  and like upload it? Scan your face. Oh. Now that you have a bear companion to show you everything
[997.34s -> 1003.50s]  on the island. What do you even do in this game? Or rather the home of Captain Lawrence Biddler.
[1004.22s -> 1017.80s]  Lawrence. What are these houses? You don't do anything. You don't do anything. You just walk
[1017.80s -> 1029.64s]  around. This is a baby game. Oh. This was like a huge seller. It's like the number one bestseller
[1030.44s -> 1051.66s]  in New York Times Connect list. My house? Oh, your house. Okay.
[1056.98s -> 1060.71s]  Where's my house? Oh, he already got in.
[1069.22s -> 1071.91s]  Those are the original like connectables?
[1089.29s -> 1094.33s]  I have to drink my coffee. You're ugly.
[1094.57s -> 1100.17s]  I were at each other's throats. You know, it really is impossible to be annoyed to death.
[1100.17s -> 1104.17s]  That's when Captain Blackwood decided it would be better for me to live with his best friend
[1104.17s -> 1114.89s]  Biddler. I think things worked out rather well actually. Oh. What's his name? Dryer? Sheet Bear?
[1115.53s -> 1117.93s]  What the heck are you doing over here? You goofball.
[1118.97s -> 1130.15s]  Journal. It explains what happened to the captains. Three weeks since we landed on
[1130.15s -> 1135.91s]  Mira. At first, I couldn't believe me eyes. Good pirate voice. But half a day's sail from the
[1135.91s -> 1139.91s]  moor. Let's see if I can match it. It's curious that we've never seen it before.
[1140.71s -> 1143.83s]  And probably it's not one-to-one so I don't sound like I'm lying.
[1145.35s -> 1150.39s]  And when we found me old friend Lawrence Biddler and little Lena here all alone.
[1150.39s -> 1156.63s]  Well, you can imagine my surprise. Lawrence told me about the gift that brought him here
[1156.63s -> 1164.33s]  and the story about the kingdom. I thought we days of treasure hunting were done after my
[1164.33s -> 1170.65s]  search for Felisaurum. But I have to admit, I can't resist the urge for more adventure.
[1170.65s -> 1175.21s]  I'm just, I'm antsy. I want to connect. I sent the crew away on the bonnie barnacle
[1175.21s -> 1180.25s]  and told the moor that Biddler and I were going to stay as long as the bears.
[1180.25s -> 1187.93s]  As on Lemuria, the bears are just cubs. Well, I have some theories about that. Up on the cliff
[1188.01s -> 1191.05s]  is an abandoned fort. 35 year old man playing video games.
[1191.05s -> 1193.29s]  It was built long ago by some band of forgotten pirates.
[1194.33s -> 1197.45s]  Don't tell anyone. Only to realize that their ship are scattered across the beaches.
[1198.49s -> 1202.65s]  Just suppose them. But what if they never left the island
[1202.65s -> 1205.53s]  and found the entrance to the hidden kingdom? How?
[1205.53s -> 1210.89s]  Tomorrow, all Biddler and I will travel. By the way, these jeans are way too small for
[1210.89s -> 1215.53s]  me now. I'm like a fat guy. I gained like 25. The ship passed on the island for months already
[1215.53s -> 1219.19s]  when captain Blackwood arrived. This bear can read?
[1219.19s -> 1223.69s]  The captain set out to explore the island. Captain Biddler asked me to look over the
[1223.69s -> 1228.33s]  house and the bears. I'm not sure what happened to them, but they never came back.
[1228.33s -> 1231.61s]  Where's my bear food? I want to like drop the bear food.
[1231.61s -> 1238.84s]  Over there is a map of the island. This is Fort Topaz. It's not far at all.
[1238.84s -> 1242.44s]  Let's go see if we can find out what happened with the captains.
[1242.44s -> 1245.16s]  I don't want to do that. I want to feed the bear.
[1245.16s -> 1249.64s]  It looks like your bear cub is ready to go. These cubs love to play at Fort Topaz.
[1250.36s -> 1256.34s]  Let's get- Okay, is it kind of weird? I feel like this is like,
[1257.75s -> 1262.57s]  bears are not like dogs. They're not like, oh, yip yip, come get me, my friend.
[1262.57s -> 1266.17s]  Like this is weird, right? Like why is the bear acting like it's a puppy that I just
[1266.17s -> 1275.61s]  bought from like, like a little small puppy. They'll kill you, right? Yeah.
[1277.90s -> 1279.34s]  Well, a baby won't.
[1279.34s -> 1282.34s]  I think your cub smells the fresh sea air.
[1282.90s -> 1293.30s]  This is a kid's game? I know. An adult playing a kid's game.
[1294.02s -> 1298.15s]  Look, they're so cute. He's acting like a puppy.
[1301.72s -> 1304.04s]  This is like a, this is like a dachshund puppy.
[1313.02s -> 1314.94s]  All right, let's play. How do, what do I do?
[1315.74s -> 1324.44s]  Friar Sheet Bear. Friar Sheet Bear. They've gone bipedal. This is where they
[1324.44s -> 1326.84s]  fucking- I just know I've saw this movie. They take over humanity.
[1328.82s -> 1332.74s]  Friar Sheet Bear. Hey, go. Oh, what'd you get?
[1336.66s -> 1337.54s]  Is it a whistle?
[1344.34s -> 1344.58s]  Yes.
[1359.96s -> 1365.32s]  It's as easy as that. Spin in place. Careful you don't get too dizzy.
[1369.94s -> 1372.34s]  Oh, it knows. To make a great team.
[1374.25s -> 1377.69s]  Okay, here's a fun one. The play dead trick.
[1377.69s -> 1382.33s]  All you have to do is lie flat on your back. Go ahead. Don't be shy.
[1382.33s -> 1384.73s]  Or you could just play dead.
[1384.73s -> 1398.98s]  Can I do like the Backstreet Boys thing? All right, fine. He's getting angry.
[1398.98s -> 1400.98s]  All right, I'll be dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
[1402.31s -> 1405.37s]  I'm dead down here. I'm dead down here.
[1412.73s -> 1414.26s]  Okay, what about this?
[1433.35s -> 1439.58s]  Leave me and my friend alone. Give me a hug. What do I do?
[1440.30s -> 1447.54s]  I'm gonna do that. Teach him look at me.
[1448.34s -> 1456.38s]  Lie down. Look, lie down. Lie down. Down. Lie down. Lie down.
[1457.34s -> 1461.26s]  Good. Good. Friar Sheet Bear. Good. Friar Sheet Bear.
[1462.22s -> 1474.39s]  Up, up, up, up, up. I don't wanna do that again.
[1482.81s -> 1489.08s]  We get money? What trick? Star Jump.
[1499.29s -> 1500.97s]  All right, let's do this like a two-year-old.
[1515.82s -> 1519.38s]  Come here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[1519.38s -> 1520.02s]  Oh, a ball.
[1535.48s -> 1536.92s]  You're gonna learn from the master.
[1541.35s -> 1554.65s]  By the way, first one to fucking blink loses. How long can you go?
[1555.29s -> 1565.45s]  I feel like this is the kind of shit that was on Jimmy Fallon 10 years ago or something.
[1574.86s -> 1576.94s]  Oh, this guy plays juggle with his bear.
[1577.82s -> 1581.78s]  He's juggle with his bear.
[1588.25s -> 1589.61s]  Jimmy Fallon is not this good.
[1596.97s -> 1597.47s]  Yes.
[1605.91s -> 1614.97s]  Oh, I thought it was a key. Landmine.
[1615.93s -> 1622.17s]  What the fuck is wrong with you? What is wrong with you, dude?
[1622.97s -> 1627.69s]  It's a lot. I'm supposed to take a sip out of that.
[1629.69s -> 1630.89s]  Oh, juggle challenge.
[1630.89s -> 1636.87s]  Keep the ball in the air.
[1636.87s -> 1642.68s]  Okay. Pop as many bubbles as you can while juggling. I'm ready for this one.
[1649.06s -> 1663.61s]  Oh, you and me. Are these frogs? This is wicked fucked up.
[1664.33s -> 1695.80s]  I told you the bears were evil. Didn't even miss one.
[1698.30s -> 1718.62s]  Didn't even miss one frog. This is terrible. I think this is bad. This is not a bad game.
[1719.58s -> 1726.02s]  Did I pick the wrong... Did I pick the expansion? Did I play the regular game?
[1726.74s -> 1734.07s]  You do this in the regular game?
[1745.62s -> 1762.78s]  He hates this game. I mean, I don't... Don't worry. We're just getting started.
[1762.78s -> 1764.86s]  We're just getting warmed up with connectables. HD.
[1765.58s -> 1768.55s]  I got the Fable Connect game back here.
[1769.91s -> 1774.55s]  Able Connect. That one's supposed to have magical fucking spells.
[1775.59s -> 1786.92s]  This is just an excuse to get parents to get their kids to move their fucking arms around.
[1786.92s -> 1792.04s]  They think they're playing with the bear cub that they're just doing the exercising.
[1797.00s -> 1802.07s]  Wonderful. Congratulations. You've earned your first medal.
[1802.07s -> 1807.53s]  That's a gold medal. You'll get a shiny trophy too.
[1807.53s -> 1812.70s]  Do you want to try again? To the fort.
[1813.90s -> 1816.62s]  Careful on these steps. They can be slippery.
[1817.18s -> 1819.98s]  Speedrun. Isn't that just a window into...
[1819.98s -> 1821.90s]  Skip, skip, skip, skip. I had a chance.
[1823.74s -> 1825.58s]  I had one opportunity to get the hell out of here.
[1826.30s -> 1842.50s]  Oh, by the way, we also have more movies to make.
[1845.50s -> 1851.27s]  Thinking about that. All right. Let's play.
[1851.91s -> 1855.83s]  Anytime you want to play with one of your toys, open your toy box.
[1855.83s -> 1858.71s]  All you have to do is hold your arm out to the bottom.
[1858.71s -> 1864.15s]  Let's go. You can also just say, open toy box or open inventory.
[1864.15s -> 1868.31s]  Next game now. Hold on. It has been 30 minutes.
[1868.31s -> 1871.54s]  How have I been in for 30 minutes? Open toy box.
[1871.54s -> 1885.66s]  Toys are available. Hold your hand over a box to see what toys are inside.
[1886.38s -> 1889.88s]  Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it on camera
[1889.88s -> 1891.32s]  so you can tell that I'm not fucking faking it?
[1891.32s -> 1892.84s]  If you see a toy you like, hold your hand...
[1892.84s -> 1898.47s]  Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[1898.47s -> 1913.02s]  Fuck yeah. Go get it.
[1913.02s -> 1919.19s]  Who has the ball? I'm doing... No, I'm not doing juggle.
[1919.19s -> 1920.31s]  I'm not doing juggle. This game suck.
[1922.22s -> 1930.78s]  Should I move on? No, it does.
[1930.78s -> 1933.82s]  I thought this was like one of the New York Times Best Seller Connect game.
[1934.62s -> 1939.14s]  Did I mess it up? Don't leave.
[1939.78s -> 1941.22s]  Don't leave dryer sheet beer.
[1941.86s -> 1944.33s]  Is this a normie game?
[1946.89s -> 1949.05s]  Like eight-year-old normies?
[1949.05s -> 1950.89s]  What are you talking about? Wait, what?
[1951.61s -> 1955.08s]  Oh, yes. It's a normie game.
[1955.08s -> 1957.00s]  All those like seven-year-olds.
[1957.00s -> 1959.16s]  The seven-year-old normies.
[1964.62s -> 1966.70s]  Seven-year-old doesn't barely have to tie shoes.
[1967.42s -> 1969.90s]  What do you mean? Bro, juggle with them.
[1969.90s -> 1972.65s]  Fine. All right. I'm going to put in...
[1972.65s -> 1973.85s]  I'm going to put in the fable game.
[1975.14s -> 1977.86s]  This is actually a cereal box game for kids.
[1978.66s -> 1984.06s]  And let me do the rubber chicken.
[1984.14s -> 1988.18s]  Let me do the rubber chicken. Hold on.
[1988.18s -> 1992.50s]  Did he fucking record that?
[1995.35s -> 1996.07s]  I don't know he could do that.
[2005.62s -> 2006.10s]  Juggling.
[2010.55s -> 2011.83s]  Xbox record that.
[2012.71s -> 2014.82s]  That must have been really loud. I'm so sorry.
[2015.78s -> 2016.98s]  Holy shit. That was probably horrible.
[2021.37s -> 2023.45s]  Hold out your arm to the bottom right.
[2031.59s -> 2032.79s]  Not loud enough.
[2032.79s -> 2034.23s]  All right. Hold on. I see a sandwich right here.
[2034.23s -> 2035.11s]  There's like some sandwich.
[2035.75s -> 2037.29s]  Let's at least like do the thing.
[2037.29s -> 2039.13s]  Let me at least like give him a bath, right?
[2039.13s -> 2041.29s]  That's like fun. That'll be like fun.
[2041.93s -> 2043.56s]  Here we go. Let's give him a bath.
[2046.71s -> 2049.11s]  Cleaning is an important way of caring for your animal.
[2049.11s -> 2049.99s]  Able. Wait.
[2049.99s -> 2051.11s]  If your animal gets dirty,
[2051.11s -> 2053.35s]  just give it a good scrub with the cleaning brush.
[2056.01s -> 2057.05s]  Washing his eyes.
[2057.05s -> 2058.57s]  All over your cub's body.
[2061.13s -> 2067.11s]  Where's the water?
[2067.11s -> 2070.89s]  I think I'm about to be using any water.
[2071.53s -> 2076.57s]  Wouldn't that just be dry and like scratchy?
[2077.29s -> 2084.18s]  All right. Let me see what the other items are.
[2084.18s -> 2084.82s]  I'm not done yet.
[2092.50s -> 2093.46s]  Dryer sheet, bear.
[2096.06s -> 2101.72s]  Oh.
[2101.78s -> 2107.26s]  To change the direction of your throw.
[2116.09s -> 2116.65s]  To the face.
[2117.21s -> 2120.98s]  He's like bounced off his nose.
[2121.54s -> 2123.70s]  I'm trying to hit her.
[2124.89s -> 2125.77s]  That's bad too.
[2127.42s -> 2128.30s]  Longest throw.
[2128.30s -> 2130.06s]  Oh yeah. I'll show you a long throw.
[2130.06s -> 2130.86s]  Let's see that.
[2130.86s -> 2131.36s]  Good boy.
[2135.42s -> 2136.14s]  I'm going to the ocean.
[2136.94s -> 2145.94s]  Hey, hey. Look, look, look, look.
[2145.94s -> 2146.84s]  Look, look, look, look.
[2146.84s -> 2147.48s]  Look what I got.
[2147.48s -> 2161.10s]  Look what I got.
[2161.10s -> 2161.60s]  Eat it.
[2175.42s -> 2178.38s]  Shit. This is so not synced up correctly.
[2178.38s -> 2184.58s]  I'm doing it and then it's happening.
[2190.26s -> 2191.06s]  Next game. Next.
[2191.06s -> 2192.02s]  Wait. One more item.
[2206.33s -> 2207.69s]  No dryer sheet, bear.
[2209.94s -> 2210.44s]  Okay.
[2214.02s -> 2214.98s]  No dryer sheet, bear.
[2214.98s -> 2215.62s]  Throw dryer.
[2215.62s -> 2216.74s]  Show dryer sheet.
[2216.74s -> 2245.86s]  What the what the fuck does he have on his head?
[2245.86s -> 2249.99s]  Sometimes your cub friend wants to play with.
[2249.99s -> 2252.34s]  Choose whether or not to.
[2252.34s -> 2256.18s]  By holding your arm out to the right for yes or to the left for no.
[2260.30s -> 2261.74s]  All right. I want to climb a tree first.
[2261.74s -> 2263.82s]  Look, I got a lot of cadet games to go through.
[2265.26s -> 2273.78s]  How do I do that?
[2273.78s -> 2277.19s]  If bears love anything, it's climbing.
[2277.19s -> 2280.70s]  Guys, no exception.
[2280.70s -> 2282.94s]  To get your bear to climb up the tree.
[2282.94s -> 2289.74s]  Move your hands above your head like this.
[2289.74s -> 2293.18s]  Step left and right to get a better view of your surroundings.
[2306.74s -> 2308.58s]  Wait. Am I on like a drone?
[2308.58s -> 2321.70s]  Your bear to climb back down the tree.
[2321.70s -> 2323.46s]  Just crouch down like this.
[2327.64s -> 2328.76s]  He's going to fall.
[2328.76s -> 2330.60s]  Your bear will slide down the trunk.
[2330.60s -> 2333.80s]  This is so stressful.
[2336.12s -> 2338.76s]  Slide down. Slide down.
[2338.76s -> 2339.80s]  If there are any little...
[2339.80s -> 2341.32s]  Come down from there.
[2341.32s -> 2343.80s]  Your bear is sure to gobble them up.
[2343.88s -> 2346.76s]  Oh, it's four bear.
[2347.96s -> 2348.60s]  It's bear.
[2349.32s -> 2350.28s]  Run to hold the part.
[2352.94s -> 2353.90s]  Oh my god.
[2365.16s -> 2365.88s]  Fucking fable.
[2366.52s -> 2376.07s]  Hold on.
[2386.62s -> 2387.82s]  Probably a lot.
[2390.15s -> 2391.59s]  Or a dryer sheet bear.
[2401.53s -> 2402.57s]  Fuck it, fable.
[2402.57s -> 2411.10s]  I thought this would make sure your room has enough space to play.
[2411.10s -> 2411.74s]  Don't look up.
[2413.02s -> 2414.30s]  An anvil going to drop on my head?
[2414.86s -> 2422.58s]  Webcam's too big.
[2422.58s -> 2427.19s]  Turn the lights off.
[2427.51s -> 2429.11s]  No, you won't be able to see me.
[2438.50s -> 2440.02s]  This is the Peter Molyneux one.
[2440.58s -> 2446.74s]  Wasn't there a Peter Molyneux game where he's like...
[2446.74s -> 2449.78s]  Take a seat, get comfortable, and get ready for your journey.
[2450.66s -> 2453.06s]  Try to sit upright and keep your legs uncrossed.
[2457.74s -> 2463.82s]  For best results, place your Kinect sensor in a central position, above or below your TV.
[2471.99s -> 2474.79s]  You may need to sit forward in your seat if it has
[2475.35s -> 2484.07s]  high arms, a low seat, or a soft back.
[2487.64s -> 2489.80s]  Make sure you have enough room to play.
[2491.80s -> 2500.74s]  Try not to sit too close to other people or objects.
[2500.74s -> 2503.11s]  You fired on me?
[2504.55s -> 2507.43s]  To access the Kinect guide while playing,
[2507.43s -> 2509.59s]  hold your left arm straight out to your side.
[2510.63s -> 2512.71s]  Try this now to begin your journey.
[2514.20s -> 2514.68s]  Left arm?
[2515.40s -> 2540.50s]  Where does it want me to go?
[2541.22s -> 2544.17s]  I just did that.
[2549.74s -> 2549.98s]  Oh!
[2550.86s -> 2553.96s]  Hold on a second.
[2555.05s -> 2555.93s]  Why is...
[2555.93s -> 2557.29s]  Resume and begin.
[2557.93s -> 2559.27s]  Resume, begin.
[2559.27s -> 2559.67s]  Why...
[2559.67s -> 2560.55s]  What do you mean resume?
[2560.55s -> 2561.75s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[2561.75s -> 2561.99s]  Why is...
[2561.99s -> 2564.39s]  What do you have a resume and begin button?
[2564.39s -> 2566.79s]  This thing is bright green.
[2566.79s -> 2567.67s]  It says resume.
[2575.42s -> 2576.30s]  Oh my god!
[2576.30s -> 2581.96s]  Running Kinect ID.
[2581.96s -> 2583.00s]  Please space the sensor.
[2593.86s -> 2594.42s]  Oh, David.
[2603.34s -> 2606.30s]  You could literally like torture me and I wouldn't know the password.
[2607.02s -> 2612.94s]  Okay, start games.
[2612.94s -> 2613.50s]  Can you see me?
[2614.14s -> 2615.05s]  I'm in view.
[2619.13s -> 2620.09s]  I want to get this right though,
[2620.09s -> 2622.01s]  because this is an actual fucking video game.
[2622.57s -> 2630.73s]  I guess it's not that bad.
[2630.73s -> 2631.45s]  It's pretty close.
[2633.62s -> 2634.66s]  Face cam, face cam.
[2634.66s -> 2636.58s]  Hold on, let me write the face cam up.
[2636.58s -> 2637.78s]  It looks fucking dark as hell.
[2638.50s -> 2645.59s]  Don't touch anything.
[2645.59s -> 2646.15s]  I can't even...
[2646.87s -> 2652.46s]  I have like a fucking whole goddamn unit of like technical directors
[2652.46s -> 2655.34s]  to like play a console game on your PC.
[2655.34s -> 2656.70s]  You got to have like 10 monitors.
[2657.34s -> 2664.18s]  To stream a console game,
[2664.18s -> 2666.66s]  you need to have like fucking 40 monitors.
[2666.66s -> 2679.03s]  It's so dark.
[2679.03s -> 2680.23s]  It's not this dark in my room.
[2685.13s -> 2687.13s]  It actually is not this dark in the room.
[2687.13s -> 2694.34s]  You need backlights?
[2694.34s -> 2696.26s]  Move the lights.
[2696.26s -> 2696.58s]  I don't have...
[2696.58s -> 2697.38s]  What do you mean move the lights?
[2697.38s -> 2702.62s]  I have a recessed light in my sensor.
[2702.62s -> 2705.86s]  Turn on the sun.
[2709.69s -> 2710.49s]  This shit is so...
[2712.49s -> 2717.21s]  Why do all these like dinky little shit webcams
[2717.21s -> 2720.65s]  need like 5,000 megawatts of light
[2720.65s -> 2722.49s]  to like be shown up on screen?
[2722.49s -> 2727.30s]  You see me?
[2727.30s -> 2732.70s]  It's like we can literally send a fucking...
[2733.50s -> 2735.02s]  A rover to Mars.
[2735.02s -> 2740.15s]  But I have to put a 5 million megawatt lamp in my face
[2740.15s -> 2744.07s]  to show up on this without blowing,
[2744.07s -> 2747.35s]  blowing the fuck out the exposure.
[2747.35s -> 2747.85s]  Why?
[2748.92s -> 2749.88s]  No, it ain't the window.
[2749.88s -> 2751.32s]  I've had this problem for years.
[2751.32s -> 2757.66s]  It's your fat ass.
[2760.02s -> 2762.34s]  My ass is just like fucking huge,
[2762.34s -> 2763.70s]  like blocking out the sun.
[2764.34s -> 2766.01s]  Get a better camera.
[2767.16s -> 2768.12s]  No, they're all like this.
[2768.12s -> 2769.48s]  All webcams are like this.
[2769.48s -> 2771.98s]  That's why there's a whole company, guys,
[2771.98s -> 2774.41s]  that makes like streamer lights.
[2774.41s -> 2777.21s]  Because they know it's like a Band-Aid problem.
[2777.21s -> 2778.09s]  You know what I mean?
[2778.09s -> 2787.10s]  I ain't getting fucking streamer lights.
[2787.10s -> 2788.14s]  Uh, hold on.
[2788.14s -> 2792.02s]  That's red.
[2792.02s -> 2792.58s]  Red.
[2792.58s -> 2799.88s]  High balance is fucking horrible.
[2799.88s -> 2805.42s]  What the hell is going on here?
[2805.98s -> 2814.23s]  Let's go!
[2814.23s -> 2819.14s]  Where did you go?
[2820.54s -> 2821.34s]  Hold on.
[2821.34s -> 2832.02s]  All right, I gotta sit back down.
[2832.02s -> 2836.79s]  Perfect.
[2836.79s -> 2837.67s]  What's over there?
[2837.67s -> 2839.27s]  Oh, there's like a fucking toy over there.
[2839.99s -> 2843.46s]  All right, that should be good.
[2844.10s -> 2845.27s]  Where did you go?
[2845.27s -> 2846.15s]  The Kinect sensor having trouble.
[2846.15s -> 2846.95s]  Okay.
[2846.95s -> 2847.59s]  Whoa, look at me.
[2847.59s -> 2848.87s]  I'm like lit up over there.
[2848.87s -> 2849.75s]  Oh yeah, I remember this.
[2850.47s -> 2851.27s]  Shit, you can't do it.
[2852.66s -> 2853.22s]  All right, I'm ready.
[2853.70s -> 2865.75s]  All right, start game.
[2866.39s -> 2871.00s]  You guys ready for fable?
[2871.00s -> 2877.67s]  Your mic's in the middle.
[2877.67s -> 2880.25s]  I got you.
[2880.25s -> 2880.65s]  There you go.
[2884.33s -> 2886.57s]  Even the greatest of journeys must begin with a single step.
[2887.29s -> 2894.76s]  I completely forgot about old console games.
[2895.48s -> 2898.44s]  We're obsessed with having alone out bloom
[2898.44s -> 2901.80s]  on every single title that made the game run at 18 frames a second
[2901.80s -> 2903.32s]  to hide the fact that the game was ugly.
[2904.20s -> 2905.00s]  You guys remember that shit?
[2905.64s -> 2906.92s]  Wow, I'm so glad we're over that.
[2907.56s -> 2919.18s]  Come on, keep the pace up.
[2919.18s -> 2921.18s]  We've got a long way to go before we get home.
[2922.06s -> 2925.32s]  To me?
[2925.32s -> 2926.12s]  Good morning, Kaplan.
[2927.08s -> 2929.56s]  Thunder, with us holding up.
[2929.56s -> 2930.76s]  Should make good time today.
[2932.86s -> 2935.42s]  Daniel, I've seen Gabriel this morning.
[2936.06s -> 2937.30s]  Oh, not again.
[2938.42s -> 2938.74s]  Dammit, Gabriel.
[2938.74s -> 2940.10s]  Audio's desynced.
[2940.10s -> 2940.58s]  Where are you?
[2940.58s -> 2941.30s]  It is.
[2941.30s -> 2942.26s]  But I think that's the game.
[2942.98s -> 2946.74s]  I don't think that's anything to do with capturing.
[2946.74s -> 2949.22s]  I believe that's just the video game.
[2949.86s -> 2956.33s]  I can't wait to wash another animal with a brush.
[2956.97s -> 2959.67s]  Like in 60% of every Kinect game.
[2959.67s -> 2979.77s]  What do you think, Seren?
[2979.77s -> 2980.01s]  Come on.
[2980.01s -> 2980.97s]  DMT's kicking it.
[2980.97s -> 2982.09s]  I'm getting better.
[2982.09s -> 2984.28s]  I'm ready for whatever we run into.
[2984.28s -> 2985.08s]  Fucking ghosts.
[2985.08s -> 2989.16s]  Bumpy roads, bit of drizzle, stuff for legends.
[2991.99s -> 2992.63s]  Come on, girl.
[2998.33s -> 2999.05s]  Eat the horse.
[3004.78s -> 3011.32s]  Oh, come here.
[3011.32s -> 3012.84s]  The convoy will be moving on soon.
[3012.84s -> 3013.88s]  We better get you ready.
[3015.59s -> 3017.19s]  There's a fucking brushing game.
[3022.18s -> 3022.98s]  Good girl, Seren.
[3022.98s -> 3023.62s]  There's a good girl.
[3024.90s -> 3026.02s]  I got double brush.
[3026.66s -> 3030.92s]  We're gonna get this part of the skin raw.
[3030.92s -> 3032.12s]  There you are, Gabriel.
[3032.12s -> 3034.04s]  Kaplan, I thought you were getting the convoy ready.
[3035.00s -> 3035.88s]  Don't even move back.
[3035.88s -> 3036.76s]  Leave me alone.
[3036.76s -> 3038.04s]  You mean the triumph already left?
[3038.04s -> 3038.84s]  What were you doing?
[3038.84s -> 3039.80s]  I gotta move the mic over here.
[3039.80s -> 3041.64s]  Were you distracted by the butterflies?
[3041.64s -> 3044.04s]  Or were you just daydreaming about old fables?
[3044.04s -> 3045.88s]  No, I was just about to get Seren ready.
[3045.88s -> 3047.88s]  Look, I'm not letting you out my sight.
[3047.88s -> 3049.08s]  Does your horse need a brushing?
[3050.20s -> 3051.24s]  Don't show me that.
[3051.24s -> 3052.60s]  I don't want that to look weird.
[3052.60s -> 3055.40s]  Now get Seren harnessed up and let's get moving.
[3055.40s -> 3056.76s]  All right, I just need to get me-
[3056.76s -> 3057.64s]  Now, Gabriel.
[3065.22s -> 3066.18s]  Why even have that part?
[3067.06s -> 3069.54s]  You so badly wanted to have the horse brushing segment.
[3069.54s -> 3070.26s]  Come on, Gabriel.
[3070.26s -> 3071.14s]  We could have opened here.
[3071.14s -> 3072.26s]  The convoy will be miles away by now.
[3072.26s -> 3073.14s]  Why have the horse-
[3073.14s -> 3074.66s]  You needed the horse brushing segment.
[3074.66s -> 3075.54s]  We could have opened here.
[3076.95s -> 3077.99s]  Keep your moustache on.
[3080.39s -> 3081.11s]  Open right here.
[3081.67s -> 3085.51s]  I can't wait to have to hold the reins.
[3085.51s -> 3086.31s]  Come on.
[3086.31s -> 3087.94s]  Catching up to do.
[3088.50s -> 3091.91s]  The tribe will be well-
[3091.91s -> 3092.39s]  What do I do?
[3092.95s -> 3095.83s]  Track the reins once to make Seren trot.
[3095.83s -> 3098.39s]  Once trotting, you can accelerate to a gallop
[3098.39s -> 3100.15s]  by cracking the reins a second time.
[3101.46s -> 3102.58s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[3104.92s -> 3105.48s]  Continue.
[3106.12s -> 3111.83s]  Here we go.
[3115.98s -> 3117.74s]  What were you doing back there, anyway?
[3118.06s -> 3118.78s]  Nothing.
[3118.78s -> 3120.86s]  Yeah, and you'd have done that all day
[3120.86s -> 3122.06s]  if I hadn't come back.
[3122.06s -> 3122.86s]  Guys, I forgot to tell you.
[3122.86s -> 3124.70s]  I got the special connect seat.
[3124.70s -> 3126.70s]  It's connected through the USB-C
[3126.70s -> 3127.66s]  in the back of the Xbox.
[3128.46s -> 3132.52s]  To steer right,
[3132.52s -> 3134.36s]  pull the right rein towards your body
[3134.36s -> 3135.80s]  and push the left rein away.
[3136.36s -> 3137.48s]  To steer left,
[3137.48s -> 3139.08s]  pull the left rein towards your body
[3139.08s -> 3141.00s]  and push the right rein away.
[3141.00s -> 3142.04s]  While steering,
[3142.04s -> 3143.32s]  try to keep your hands low
[3143.32s -> 3145.32s]  and make large, clear movements.
[3145.32s -> 3147.24s]  All right, we're going off a fucking cliff, I think.
[3161.21s -> 3162.49s]  Hey, open your eyes.
[3163.37s -> 3165.53s]  Hey, it's called steering.
[3165.53s -> 3166.09s]  Try it.
[3167.53s -> 3172.58s]  Oh, what are we doing?
[3172.58s -> 3173.22s]  What are we up to?
[3174.18s -> 3177.54s]  What are we doing?
[3177.54s -> 3180.42s]  Uh, reconnect seat.
[3180.42s -> 3181.22s]  That's right, I forgot.
[3181.22s -> 3182.82s]  It has like a little launch pad.
[3183.70s -> 3186.30s]  You know what they used to fucking make?
[3186.30s -> 3186.86s]  Shit like that.
[3186.86s -> 3188.06s]  They wanted it to be like that.
[3188.62s -> 3189.50s]  When are you going to fix up
[3189.50s -> 3191.10s]  this whole cart, Gabriel?
[3191.10s -> 3191.98s]  Soon.
[3191.98s -> 3193.18s]  There was like a vest.
[3193.18s -> 3195.34s]  There was like a whole huge vest you could put on
[3195.34s -> 3196.62s]  that when you get like shot in a game,
[3196.62s -> 3198.06s]  it like vibrated your heart.
[3199.10s -> 3202.94s]  They so badly wanted you to get like
[3202.94s -> 3203.82s]  actually hurt and shit.
[3211.83s -> 3212.87s]  Hey, look at him.
[3212.87s -> 3222.36s]  I'm not doing that.
[3222.92s -> 3225.78s]  Let me guess.
[3226.50s -> 3227.38s]  You were up all night
[3227.38s -> 3228.98s]  reading those old books of yours again,
[3228.98s -> 3229.70s]  weren't you?
[3229.70s -> 3231.06s]  Well, not all night.
[3231.06s -> 3232.26s]  Into the wall, into the wall.
[3232.26s -> 3233.46s]  No, you only do the
[3233.46s -> 3234.82s]  drive into the wall joke twice
[3234.82s -> 3235.62s]  before it's too much.
[3236.34s -> 3238.50s]  All this dreaming about magic,
[3238.50s -> 3239.94s]  heroes, stories we read
[3239.94s -> 3241.70s]  when we were knee high to a hob.
[3241.70s -> 3242.74s]  It's got to stop.
[3243.86s -> 3245.14s]  We're not children anymore.
[3245.14s -> 3246.90s]  Do I get to pick like my class?
[3246.90s -> 3248.74s]  And start doing, Gabriel.
[3248.74s -> 3252.66s]  Old fairy tales didn't get me where I am today.
[3252.66s -> 3253.30s]  Head of the combo.
[3253.30s -> 3254.26s]  Do I have like powers?
[3254.26s -> 3255.38s]  Do I have a weapon?
[3256.10s -> 3257.30s]  I had to make sacrifices.
[3257.30s -> 3258.98s]  This is an insanely long
[3258.98s -> 3260.50s]  ride the horse opening segment.
[3260.50s -> 3261.70s]  We don't need this here.
[3264.39s -> 3268.23s]  You showed me how the ride on the reins, right?
[3268.23s -> 3270.15s]  Let's keep it slow through here.
[3270.15s -> 3271.03s]  Nice and easy.
[3273.46s -> 3274.98s]  This segment is far too long.
[3274.98s -> 3276.82s]  Gently pull the reins to your chest
[3276.82s -> 3277.94s]  to lower your speed.
[3278.84s -> 3280.44s]  Rough terrain will injure Saren
[3280.44s -> 3281.96s]  and less ridden over at a trot.
[3282.60s -> 3284.84s]  Oh, that's why I was getting all fucked up.
[3284.84s -> 3287.00s]  So make sure you take good care of her.
[3291.05s -> 3292.01s]  Easy now.
[3292.01s -> 3293.21s]  Slow it down, Gabriel.
[3294.52s -> 3295.16s]  There you go.
[3295.88s -> 3297.72s]  Why can't you drive like this all the time?
[3298.44s -> 3300.81s]  That's the way.
[3301.53s -> 3302.49s]  Sarah may be old,
[3302.49s -> 3304.65s]  but there's still a few miles left in the old girl.
[3304.65s -> 3305.37s]  All right, we're good.
[3305.37s -> 3306.89s]  Don't listen to him, girl.
[3306.89s -> 3308.89s]  He just wishes he had a horse like you.
[3308.89s -> 3309.85s]  Yeah, right.
[3309.85s -> 3310.49s]  That'll be it.
[3312.33s -> 3315.08s]  I think that was rough terrain,
[3315.08s -> 3316.12s]  but it doesn't matter.
[3316.92s -> 3318.04s]  I don't think this matters.
[3322.18s -> 3322.90s]  Except for the,
[3322.90s -> 3324.74s]  except for whoever's in the back.
[3324.74s -> 3327.78s]  Whoever's inside of the cart is like,
[3327.78s -> 3329.22s]  oh my fucking God,
[3329.22s -> 3331.06s]  I can't even drink my tea.
[3331.06s -> 3332.50s]  You and Saren are going for a swim.
[3333.30s -> 3336.78s]  Show me how fast you can stop this thing.
[3336.78s -> 3337.42s]  Just so I know,
[3337.42s -> 3339.18s]  I don't have to worry about you when we get there.
[3340.81s -> 3343.05s]  If you need to come to a full stop quickly,
[3343.05s -> 3344.97s]  pull the reins back high over your head.
[3344.97s -> 3345.69s]  Over your head?
[3354.97s -> 3356.81s]  Oh, all right.
[3356.81s -> 3358.01s]  I feel better now.
[3358.01s -> 3359.21s]  Now let's get moving.
[3359.21s -> 3360.01s]  Catch up to the comms.
[3360.01s -> 3361.21s]  I'm going to open up the back.
[3361.21s -> 3362.89s]  I'm going to go to the back of this thing and like,
[3363.53s -> 3363.93s]  open it up.
[3363.93s -> 3365.61s]  All the luggage is going to be everywhere.
[3366.73s -> 3368.49s]  All the luggage is going to be everywhere.
[3369.37s -> 3370.81s]  It's going to be like an overturned table.
[3371.69s -> 3372.33s]  Okay, hold on.
[3373.05s -> 3376.12s]  Did we get over?
[3388.23s -> 3388.95s]  Where are we going?
[3389.67s -> 3396.98s]  What happened?
[3397.62s -> 3410.04s]  This segment is way too fucking long.
[3411.00s -> 3414.10s]  Oh, I have four health left.
[3414.66s -> 3417.40s]  Get me to the town.
[3418.04s -> 3422.81s]  As you travel, you'll come across
[3422.81s -> 3425.43s]  experienced orbs on the road.
[3425.43s -> 3427.91s]  Collecting these will allow you to purchase upgrades.
[3428.55s -> 3430.95s]  Green orbs can be collected at any speed,
[3430.95s -> 3433.27s]  but other colors require specific speeds.
[3433.27s -> 3436.39s]  You know when you put like a video file into like a final cut
[3436.39s -> 3438.63s]  or a premiere timeline and you right click it
[3438.63s -> 3441.43s]  and you just say like 50% playback speed?
[3442.39s -> 3446.07s]  I swear to God, I feel like that a lot of devs do like the,
[3446.07s -> 3448.87s]  put the game in and right click the fucking file
[3448.87s -> 3451.11s]  and do 50% fucking playback speed.
[3451.91s -> 3456.15s]  Just stretch the thing extra like another hour, two hours.
[3456.15s -> 3456.79s]  There's no reason.
[3466.23s -> 3468.71s]  Are people afraid that if they have like a four-hour experience,
[3468.71s -> 3469.91s]  not like a seven-hour experience,
[3469.91s -> 3472.47s]  that like it's going to be bad or something?
[3472.47s -> 3474.07s]  Like I'd rather have a three-hour experience
[3474.07s -> 3477.19s]  without me like fucking just stretched out timeline
[3478.71s -> 3481.43s]  and a seven-hour fucking filled with a bunch of junk.
[3481.43s -> 3482.15s]  Where did the time go?
[3482.95s -> 3485.35s]  Seems like only yesterday we were running through the fields
[3485.35s -> 3488.79s]  to play fighting sticks, not caring the world.
[3488.79s -> 3489.29s]  Hold on.
[3490.15s -> 3491.75s]  Sometimes I miss those days.
[3491.75s -> 3495.91s]  I swear to God, people, a lot of devs and maybe it's both.
[3495.91s -> 3498.95s]  Maybe it's like developers, reviewers, consumers, I don't know.
[3499.75s -> 3502.07s]  Like the prospect of having like a good five-hour game
[3502.07s -> 3504.87s]  versus like a bloated 12-hour game is I don't understand.
[3505.59s -> 3507.35s]  I'd rather have just to just cut all the bullshit out
[3507.35s -> 3508.39s]  and give me a fucking good game.
[3509.67s -> 3512.70s]  That's got to be, it's got to be eight to 12 hours.
[3513.26s -> 3513.76s]  Why?
[3514.48s -> 3515.37s]  Just make it good.
[3516.17s -> 3517.82s]  It's got to be 20.
[3517.82s -> 3518.32s]  I'm sorry.
[3519.18s -> 3520.38s]  It's got to be a 28.
[3520.38s -> 3521.98s]  It's going to be a 30-hour experience.
[3522.70s -> 3524.04s]  Just make it 15.
[3524.68s -> 3525.40s]  Doesn't matter.
[3525.40s -> 3526.12s]  Make it a good game.
[3531.34s -> 3532.22s]  Only 12.
[3532.22s -> 3535.90s]  There on the horizon, bower stone or bricks and smoke.
[3536.70s -> 3538.54s]  Why would anyone live in a place like that
[3538.54s -> 3540.22s]  when they could have the open road, eh?
[3541.10s -> 3542.54s]  Five hours with replayability.
[3542.54s -> 3543.04s]  There you go.
[3544.06s -> 3547.24s]  Okay, I don't want to do this segment anymore.
[3557.00s -> 3560.68s]  We've been riding on the horse for like how, honestly, how long?
[3561.32s -> 3563.08s]  How long have we done tutorial horse for?
[3566.01s -> 3568.49s]  It's been like 14 or 15 straight minutes.
[3568.49s -> 3570.17s]  I've just ride on the horse tutorial.
[3570.17s -> 3571.85s]  I read it nearly ended the world once.
[3577.95s -> 3578.91s]  Holy shit.
[3578.91s -> 3580.67s]  And just he's gonna take it from me anyways.
[3580.67s -> 3583.40s]  Wherever that storm's coming from, it's heading this way.
[3585.79s -> 3587.07s]  The whole game is a tutorial.
[3587.71s -> 3590.78s]  I need to ride ahead now.
[3590.78s -> 3592.54s]  We'll be at Reba's reach soon.
[3592.54s -> 3594.70s]  Have to make sure the tribes together when we cross.
[3595.26s -> 3598.40s]  Just make sure you keep up the pace.
[3598.40s -> 3598.90s]  All right.
[3601.40s -> 3603.64s]  Saren can go even faster.
[3603.64s -> 3606.84s]  While galloping, crack the reins once to make Saren sprint.
[3607.40s -> 3610.20s]  Each time you crack the reins to make Saren sprint,
[3610.20s -> 3611.16s]  you'll use up some of her stamina.
[3611.16s -> 3611.72s]  All right, let's go.
[3612.60s -> 3618.59s]  If the stamina bar in the bowden center empties,
[3618.59s -> 3620.99s]  continuing to crack the reins will injure Saren.
[3621.63s -> 3623.23s]  All right, watch the stamina bar.
[3623.23s -> 3624.83s]  The bar will recharge.
[3624.83s -> 3627.20s]  Horse riding sim.
[3627.20s -> 3628.72s]  This is not even a horse riding sim though.
[3628.72s -> 3630.96s]  This is watching a horse riding sim movie.
[3630.96s -> 3632.72s]  See how fast we can catch up with the trine.
[3632.72s -> 3633.87s]  You ready, girl?
[3634.91s -> 3641.40s]  All right, let's go.
[3641.40s -> 3642.04s]  Cross the bridge.
[3642.68s -> 3645.63s]  I can't wait to get to Shalefields.
[3646.75s -> 3649.63s]  Just think this time tomorrow we'll be across the river iron washing in the storm.
[3649.63s -> 3650.59s]  All right, how do I pull back?
[3650.59s -> 3651.23s]  Pull back the reins.
[3651.23s -> 3652.83s]  Looking up the clouds.
[3652.83s -> 3653.79s]  I care in the world.
[3654.59s -> 3662.82s]  Okay.
[3663.92s -> 3666.00s]  I was joking about my own saliva.
[3668.20s -> 3676.73s]  I can't go off the edge.
[3676.73s -> 3677.23s]  I tried.
[3679.79s -> 3682.52s]  Oh my god, a TV show.
[3682.52s -> 3698.08s]  All right, we got to see what this like Red Dead Redemption 2 stranger is.
[3698.80s -> 3706.41s]  Let's see.
[3708.73s -> 3709.53s]  What are we doing here?
[3710.25s -> 3714.32s]  Oh, I like choked on my spit and it like gave me a headache.
[3715.12s -> 3715.62s]  All right, stop.
[3716.96s -> 3717.46s]  Who are you?
[3720.96s -> 3724.46s]  I swear to god if he comes up with two brushes, I'm gonna be so pissed.
[3727.76s -> 3747.72s]  This is the whole game.
[3747.72s -> 3753.80s]  What you seek is for me to wallpaper your dining room a week next Thursday.
[3753.80s -> 3756.06s]  Uh, I don't think so.
[3756.06s -> 3757.34s]  Chicken chicer.
[3757.34s -> 3759.90s]  Oh, look, he's a little chicken chicer.
[3761.10s -> 3761.82s]  Chicken chicer.
[3766.28s -> 3769.88s]  I don't have any silver.
[3771.26s -> 3772.62s]  No, no, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[3778.96s -> 3779.84s]  Oh, shit.
[3791.74s -> 3793.26s]  God fucking damn it.
[3793.26s -> 3807.63s]  I wanted to do that.
[3816.46s -> 3821.82s]  What if we didn't have the stretched out timeline?
[3821.82s -> 3824.70s]  Oh, and yes, that's me, the magician.
[3824.70s -> 3825.66s]  Excuse me.
[3825.66s -> 3829.42s]  I will be painting your walls and your ceilings if you want.
[3829.42s -> 3832.14s]  Just fucking tell me what do we want me to do.
[3832.14s -> 3835.07s]  I'm here.
[3835.07s -> 3839.13s]  We can be pretty fast when we have to be, eh, girl?
[3848.38s -> 3852.14s]  What's the world coming to?
[3853.34s -> 3854.94s]  Mad cuz bad.
[3854.94s -> 3856.38s]  So glad you could join us.
[3856.38s -> 3858.03s]  I'm needed at the front of the convoy.
[3858.03s -> 3861.47s]  Oh, thank god, thank god you could join us for the slow part of the tutorial.
[3861.47s -> 3862.27s]  Can I go with you?
[3862.27s -> 3863.55s]  Oh, you can't even speed up.
[3863.55s -> 3867.13s]  Stay here at the back, Injured.
[3867.13s -> 3868.33s]  What shall I do with the other eye?
[3868.97s -> 3869.77s]  Very funny.
[3870.33s -> 3873.29s]  Just do your job and keep up with the convoy.
[3873.29s -> 3874.33s]  I'm counting on you.
[3874.97s -> 3877.93s]  And make sure you don't fall asleep again, all right?
[3877.93s -> 3879.95s]  I'm not pulling you out of any more ditches.
[3880.83s -> 3881.63s]  Yeah.
[3881.63s -> 3882.43s]  Yeah.
[3882.43s -> 3890.84s]  Did you hear that, Seren?
[3890.84s -> 3892.28s]  Did you hear what he said to me?
[3892.28s -> 3893.24s]  Did you hear that?
[3893.24s -> 3894.36s]  Did you hear that?
[3894.36s -> 3896.12s]  After all the trouble I got into last time.
[3896.92s -> 3910.88s]  What even happened?
[3910.88s -> 3915.44s]  How long has it been?
[3916.44s -> 3917.96s]  He fucking fell asleep.
[3918.52s -> 3918.76s]  What?
[3918.76s -> 3919.96s]  He actually fell asleep.
[3920.84s -> 3925.93s]  Why did he fall asleep?
[3934.99s -> 3935.71s]  Red orbs.
[3935.71s -> 3936.59s]  Run, girl, run.
[3936.59s -> 3942.59s]  What are you doing?
[3943.31s -> 3947.80s]  Oh, catch up with everybody.
[3947.80s -> 3950.28s]  He fell asleep holding the brain.
[3950.28s -> 3951.96s]  Get to the convoy before it reaches the bridge.
[3951.96s -> 3953.64s]  Catlin might not realize we were gone.
[3954.20s -> 3955.48s]  I saw the death symbol and I was like,
[3955.48s -> 3956.68s]  I got to get some action in here.
[3956.68s -> 3959.55s]  Because I'm going to trust me again.
[3974.67s -> 3975.63s]  Damn it, Gabriel.
[3975.63s -> 3976.27s]  Where are you?
[3977.15s -> 3978.54s]  God damn it.
[3978.54s -> 3979.50s]  I'm trying to go off the edge.
[3979.50s -> 3981.82s]  I'm trying to get some fucking comedy on my screen.
[3981.82s -> 3983.74s]  All I had to do was stay awake.
[3983.74s -> 3984.94s]  Why didn't I stay awake?
[3991.34s -> 3995.58s]  Wait, I got to inject an absolute comedy home run right now.
[3995.58s -> 3996.62s]  Oh, malware bytes.
[3996.62s -> 3997.50s]  What are you talking about?
[3997.50s -> 3997.74s]  What?
[3998.46s -> 4000.38s]  Why is malware bytes popping up?
[4000.38s -> 4001.50s]  How long was he asleep?
[4002.14s -> 4003.66s]  This storm was miles away.
[4010.59s -> 4011.31s]  Oh, shit.
[4011.31s -> 4012.27s]  What happened down there?
[4013.15s -> 4018.91s]  I thought that was us for a second.
[4018.91s -> 4032.36s]  Just go flying.
[4034.76s -> 4035.56s]  What was that?
[4037.20s -> 4038.32s]  Why did he run out?
[4038.32s -> 4040.24s]  And what was that one's hand?
[4040.24s -> 4055.07s]  I can't hear you.
[4055.07s -> 4058.01s]  I didn't pick up the thing you said.
[4059.48s -> 4061.96s]  Sorry, but I'm going to assume you said to go to
[4063.16s -> 4064.12s]  Myanmar.
[4064.12s -> 4065.80s]  That's where I'm going.
[4084.49s -> 4085.37s]  Myanmar?
[4085.37s -> 4086.25s]  What did he say?
[4086.25s -> 4087.05s]  Myer Moore.
[4087.85s -> 4091.85s]  What did he say?
[4096.35s -> 4097.23s]  Like the Myer?
[4099.88s -> 4100.60s]  Manor Moore?
[4103.29s -> 4104.65s]  I hope he falls asleep again.
[4105.69s -> 4107.45s]  Oh, Microsoft Studios presents
[4110.06s -> 4111.74s]  a Lionhead Studios production.
[4115.20s -> 4117.52s]  What a seamless, seamless transition to the game.
[4120.32s -> 4120.72s]  Fable.
[4121.36s -> 4122.08s]  The Journey.
[4128.27s -> 4131.23s]  Starring you.
[4132.51s -> 4135.13s]  It's a fucking hog moment.
[4135.13s -> 4135.45s]  I'm ready.
[4141.18s -> 4142.78s]  Wake up asleep again, please.
[4142.78s -> 4144.38s]  And then maybe I have to go like this.
[4144.54s -> 4144.94s]  For an hour.
[4155.77s -> 4156.41s]  On that map.
[4159.88s -> 4162.04s]  Let's just try to get through Fairwood first.
[4162.76s -> 4164.12s]  Then we'll take it from there.
[4164.12s -> 4166.52s]  Oh, the GPS really took you a fucking shitty way.
[4167.32s -> 4169.32s]  Could have gone like straight.
[4170.36s -> 4172.20s]  There's like five roads that go that way.
[4172.76s -> 4174.73s]  Okay, here we go.
[4175.45s -> 4179.66s]  I can't believe that just happened.
[4179.66s -> 4181.98s]  I can't believe we're stuck out here alone.
[4181.98s -> 4183.58s]  Miles away from anywhere.
[4183.58s -> 4185.56s]  I just stayed awake.
[4185.56s -> 4187.72s]  We'd be across that bridge and on our way home by now.
[4187.72s -> 4188.92s]  Not stuck out here.
[4190.20s -> 4192.60s]  The map says there's a village up ahead.
[4192.60s -> 4193.16s]  There's a village.
[4193.16s -> 4194.68s]  Someone there will be able to help us.
[4195.64s -> 4196.36s]  Reach the village.
[4198.38s -> 4199.26s]  Triumph.
[4199.26s -> 4200.14s]  Go slower.
[4212.48s -> 4214.00s]  Give me those bits.
[4214.00s -> 4223.00s]  All right, we made it to Fairwood.
[4223.00s -> 4224.44s]  You have to be careful, Seren.
[4224.44s -> 4225.88s]  Need to be careful.
[4225.88s -> 4228.68s]  You've just earned your first upgrade token.
[4228.68s -> 4231.56s]  You can access your upgrades from the pause menu.
[4231.56s -> 4232.84s]  To pause the game now,
[4232.84s -> 4234.84s]  hold your left arm straight out to the side.
[4234.84s -> 4235.80s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[4236.84s -> 4238.60s]  Upgrade me?
[4243.08s -> 4243.64s]  What the fuck?
[4243.64s -> 4244.20s]  Are you kidding me?
[4244.20s -> 4245.16s]  This is fucking awesome.
[4251.56s -> 4253.50s]  Calm down.
[4253.50s -> 4253.82s]  Whoa.
[4255.10s -> 4255.58s]  Upgrades.
[4256.30s -> 4265.71s]  Worst upgrade.
[4266.27s -> 4279.82s]  Redeem Fable Heroes Gold?
[4280.46s -> 4285.34s]  Oh yeah.
[4285.34s -> 4286.70s]  Didn't they do a thing where they made...
[4289.16s -> 4290.28s]  They did a thing.
[4290.28s -> 4291.72s]  They did do a thing, right?
[4291.72s -> 4294.44s]  Where there was this like slot machine game that they came up with?
[4295.32s -> 4299.00s]  Was it like a card game?
[4299.00s -> 4300.84s]  You made money and you could use it in Fable 2 or something?
[4300.84s -> 4301.56s]  I'm gonna hit that.
[4312.99s -> 4318.92s]  All right, pull it back.
[4320.51s -> 4322.19s]  When will we push the cart to one side?
[4323.07s -> 4327.88s]  God damn.
[4327.88s -> 4332.44s]  Like the Kinect is like the 3D glasses of the last generation.
[4332.44s -> 4333.08s]  It really was.
[4333.96s -> 4338.04s]  It was the stereographic 3D glasses of the last generation before this one.
[4343.08s -> 4350.54s]  I guess Shrub by fucking lightning?
[4355.84s -> 4361.52s]  Next game.
[4361.52s -> 4361.76s]  Not...
[4361.76s -> 4362.64s]  Hold on a second here.
[4362.64s -> 4363.44s]  Wait till I get a weapon.
[4364.24s -> 4370.28s]  Let me get a weapon first.
[4375.29s -> 4380.86s]  Sword.
[4381.58s -> 4389.37s]  Why does he not have a weapon?
[4399.87s -> 4401.87s]  Do we have choices to make like in Fable?
[4403.13s -> 4406.89s]  Like let the lady get eaten by the monster or like fix the ship?
[4408.01s -> 4420.83s]  Who's got...
[4420.83s -> 4421.15s]  Who?
[4443.44s -> 4444.40s]  Don't worry, I got this.
[4452.99s -> 4456.09s]  You new around here?
[4457.53s -> 4458.96s]  Yeah, me too.
[4458.96s -> 4459.68s]  I just rolled in.
[4465.56s -> 4467.32s]  You're not waving your arms enough.
[4467.32s -> 4468.68s]  You're not waving your arms enough.
[4470.20s -> 4471.24s]  More arm waving.
[4473.02s -> 4474.54s]  The only way we'll be able to escape.
[4499.47s -> 4500.59s]  He's shooting us.
[4502.75s -> 4503.87s]  Watch out, spikes.
[4507.71s -> 4509.55s]  This is a Disney ride.
[4509.55s -> 4510.59s]  Get away from this evil.
[4510.59s -> 4511.87s]  Do not let him touch the horse.
[4511.87s -> 4513.07s]  No, this is a Disney ride.
[4513.07s -> 4514.83s]  This is a Disney ride that you get off and you go.
[4514.83s -> 4515.87s]  That was not very good.
[4516.99s -> 4519.34s]  It's one of those boxes you go in
[4519.34s -> 4521.66s]  and you like go like this for like four straight minutes.
[4522.78s -> 4525.40s]  Oh, there he comes.
[4525.40s -> 4526.04s]  Look at those.
[4528.60s -> 4529.56s]  He's just screen.
[4534.64s -> 4537.61s]  And as you get off the ride and you kind of look around,
[4537.61s -> 4541.48s]  you're like, ah, that was like...
[4541.48s -> 4543.08s]  It took us like 40 minutes to get on that.
[4546.12s -> 4548.20s]  Can I just eat like the Mickey Mouse bar?
[4549.32s -> 4557.76s]  Okay, if like a YouTube video of the ride
[4557.76s -> 4559.12s]  is as good as the ride,
[4559.12s -> 4560.56s]  I don't know if it's worth waiting an hour for.
[4576.76s -> 4577.40s]  On rails.
[4577.40s -> 4578.44s]  This is not even on rails.
[4579.32s -> 4580.52s]  I'm not even really doing anything.
[4583.85s -> 4587.93s]  It is on, but like, completely on rails.
[4589.69s -> 4590.81s]  That's what on rails means.
[4593.05s -> 4596.22s]  Oh my god.
[4596.22s -> 4596.62s]  Whoa.
[4596.62s -> 4598.62s]  And right there you look over and your mom is like,
[4598.86s -> 4599.66s]  Keep going, girl.
[4599.66s -> 4600.38s]  You have to keep going.
[4600.38s -> 4602.30s]  It's like, oh, mom's having a good fucking time.
[4602.30s -> 4604.06s]  I'm having fun because mom's having fun.
[4604.06s -> 4608.96s]  Go look back, Seren.
[4608.96s -> 4610.32s]  Oh, flash.
[4611.20s -> 4612.24s]  Oh, they just took the picture.
[4617.31s -> 4619.31s]  And then every time I tell me if I'm crazy,
[4620.35s -> 4622.43s]  every single time I look at one of those photos of me,
[4622.99s -> 4624.19s]  tell me if you guys do this too.
[4624.19s -> 4626.11s]  I try so hard to not look weird.
[4626.83s -> 4628.99s]  I know exactly when the fucking flash is going to happen,
[4628.99s -> 4630.43s]  but I desperately don't want to look weird.
[4631.07s -> 4632.35s]  So I sit there and I'm like,
[4632.35s -> 4634.83s]  I'm like, don't want to look like I'm having too much fun
[4634.83s -> 4636.19s]  because it'd be like weird.
[4636.19s -> 4637.31s]  But every time I go in and look,
[4638.11s -> 4639.79s]  I always look like my face is made out of clay.
[4639.79s -> 4640.99s]  We have to find somewhere to stop.
[4640.99s -> 4641.55s]  Every time.
[4641.55s -> 4643.15s]  Just need to hold on a little bit longer, girl.
[4643.15s -> 4644.43s]  It doesn't matter if I'm like smiling
[4644.43s -> 4647.47s]  or if I'm like going like this or something.
[4647.47s -> 4648.91s]  My face always looks like this.
[4648.91s -> 4650.11s]  You have to hold on, girl.
[4653.95s -> 4656.83s]  I just look like shit every time.
[4656.83s -> 4660.43s]  I've tried to look good in those photos.
[4660.43s -> 4661.55s]  Like, I know it's coming there.
[4661.55s -> 4662.51s]  We're going over the bend.
[4662.51s -> 4664.35s]  I know this is where they take the flash.
[4664.35s -> 4666.56s]  I go like that.
[4666.56s -> 4668.81s]  I don't want to look weird, but it doesn't matter.
[4668.81s -> 4669.85s]  Even if I sit there and go like this,
[4669.85s -> 4670.73s]  I know the flash is coming.
[4671.29s -> 4673.21s]  Oh, let's go find it.
[4673.21s -> 4673.93s]  Okay, flash.
[4673.93s -> 4674.81s]  Let's go find it at the end.
[4674.81s -> 4675.45s]  Okay, where is it?
[4678.17s -> 4679.13s]  What the fuck, dude?
[4679.13s -> 4681.29s]  I tried to not look like a fucking weirdo.
[4694.70s -> 4695.98s]  Find a safe place to stop.
[4698.78s -> 4700.22s]  I'm giving this one some more time.
[4700.22s -> 4701.18s]  Whoa, girl.
[4701.18s -> 4704.01s]  I have to get those splinters out of you.
[4704.01s -> 4704.73s]  Oh, God.
[4704.73s -> 4705.45s]  Okay, here we go.
[4709.08s -> 4711.72s]  Whatever that was, it's gone now.
[4711.72s -> 4714.92s]  I know I'm scared.
[4714.92s -> 4715.80s]  The horse is now evil.
[4720.51s -> 4722.59s]  This is a loading screen to pull the arrow out.
[4724.27s -> 4726.03s]  Seren has been seriously injured.
[4726.75s -> 4728.59s]  Grab the splinter with your right hand
[4728.59s -> 4729.95s]  and slowly pull it out.
[4730.59s -> 4732.27s]  Be careful while pulling the splinter
[4732.27s -> 4733.55s]  or you may hurt Seren.
[4736.12s -> 4738.60s]  Then when you're done, grab the brush
[4738.60s -> 4741.00s]  and give her a nice scrub.
[4766.41s -> 4767.05s]  I'm sorry.
[4770.08s -> 4770.72s]  I got it.
[4772.40s -> 4775.79s]  Let me pet.
[4775.79s -> 4777.39s]  Let me, I'm too close, but so far away.
[4777.39s -> 4778.27s]  Let me pet the horse.
[4778.91s -> 4784.27s]  Oh, yes, that was a, let me, yes.
[4784.27s -> 4788.11s]  That was a loading screen to pull out a splinter
[4788.11s -> 4790.03s]  to go to a loading screen for a cutscene.
[4803.31s -> 4806.19s]  I'm just, I'm just like, I hate playing this game now.
[4806.19s -> 4807.71s]  I need to know what's in it.
[4807.71s -> 4808.19s]  I have to know.
[4811.45s -> 4813.93s]  Connect doesn't sound like such a good idea anymore, does it?
[4814.41s -> 4817.20s]  Poison from the devourer's attack is spreading quickly.
[4827.69s -> 4828.89s]  All right, after this stream is over,
[4828.89s -> 4830.41s]  I'm going to drop kick the connect
[4830.41s -> 4832.97s]  and see how far I can punt it on the football field.
[4832.97s -> 4835.21s]  I think I could get it, I think I could get it 30 yards.
[4835.21s -> 4837.21s]  I think I could, at least 20.
[4838.01s -> 4841.15s]  I need you to be strong now, girl.
[4841.15s -> 4843.72s]  We should leave now.
[4843.72s -> 4844.52s]  You have to hang on.
[4846.96s -> 4847.84s]  At least 15.
[4847.84s -> 4849.44s]  I think I could get it at least 10 to 15.
[4850.56s -> 4853.53s]  You give me a big enough shoe.
[4853.53s -> 4854.25s]  I think I could do it.
[4854.97s -> 4865.26s]  I'm having fun though.
[4865.98s -> 4867.26s]  We're almost there.
[4867.26s -> 4868.14s]  Follow this road.
[4870.17s -> 4870.81s]  Oh, no.
[4873.80s -> 4875.16s]  Then you must keep on moving.
[4875.16s -> 4876.44s]  The poison is spreading.
[4880.70s -> 4882.54s]  What happens if it finds us again?
[4882.54s -> 4884.14s]  The choice will have to be made.
[4884.14s -> 4885.34s]  What is on the back of this box?
[4885.34s -> 4886.30s]  To fight.
[4886.30s -> 4889.10s]  Fight? What chance would we have against that thing?
[4889.10s -> 4890.22s]  After what happened back there?
[4891.90s -> 4896.64s]  Beware the magic.
[4896.64s -> 4898.64s]  The fate of Albion is in your hands.
[4898.72s -> 4903.60s]  Your easygoing nomadic life is forever altered when you suddenly become successor to vast
[4903.60s -> 4904.80s]  and mysterious powers.
[4905.36s -> 4912.27s]  Set off to uncover the evil that threatens the land as you learn to control your growing magic
[4912.27s -> 4915.53s]  and bring to bear the power that will decide the future of Albion.
[4915.53s -> 4917.05s]  The power is in your hands.
[4917.05s -> 4920.89s]  Use your hands to quickly craft and wield magic in ways never dreamed possible.
[4921.55s -> 4925.24s]  Plunge into deep and immersive gameplay in your journey to save Albion.
[4925.24s -> 4928.84s]  Travel through the world of Albion in the best looking fable game of all time.
[4928.84s -> 4930.64s]  That's not real.
[4930.64s -> 4932.16s]  We've rid a horse for an hour.
[4932.16s -> 4937.66s]  We are still alive.
[4938.30s -> 4943.45s]  What it should read, what it should say is
[4945.95s -> 4949.71s]  use your magical hands to brush the horse back and forth four times.
[4950.99s -> 4953.79s]  Lean into the stunning beauty of removing a splinter.
[4954.35s -> 4965.63s]  I bet you we cast one spell in the next 45 minutes and I want to be certain of it.
[4966.11s -> 4970.83s]  Follow the stream, Gabriel.
[4970.83s -> 4971.55s]  He hates it.
[4972.27s -> 4979.05s]  Is she gonna make it?
[4979.77s -> 4981.13s]  You can see the future.
[4981.13s -> 4982.33s]  See is know everything, right?
[4982.89s -> 4984.09s]  See is know everything.
[4984.09s -> 4988.01s]  The injury that Devourer dealt me appears to have clouded my vision.
[4988.01s -> 4988.89s]  We have a chance.
[4990.01s -> 4996.41s]  That's such a funny, like, mysterious fantasy cop out.
[4996.41s -> 4997.37s]  Oh, I'm a seer.
[4997.37s -> 4997.93s]  Oh, yes.
[4999.05s -> 5004.65s]  If we don't get there in exactly 14 minutes, yes, the poison will get her.
[5004.65s -> 5005.85s]  Like, a seer can see.
[5005.85s -> 5009.45s]  Oh, yes, there's great evil coming in the next hour of gameplay.
[5009.45s -> 5010.33s]  Evil on the way.
[5010.33s -> 5010.97s]  I'm a seer.
[5010.97s -> 5011.45s]  I can see it.
[5012.57s -> 5013.61s]  I want to see her to be wrong.
[5015.74s -> 5019.02s]  I want to see her to be like, oh, the great and powerful evil is upon us.
[5019.02s -> 5021.18s]  It will be here in two days.
[5021.18s -> 5023.58s]  Oh, it's got big horns.
[5023.58s -> 5024.38s]  And it's like a squirrel.
[5025.66s -> 5028.00s]  And it's like, holy shit, that was a fucking squirrel.
[5028.00s -> 5029.04s]  You were completely wrong.
[5029.76s -> 5030.64s]  And then they disappeared.
[5030.64s -> 5031.52s]  They're gone the next day.
[5032.72s -> 5035.28s]  That character is gone because they know they fucked it all up and they left.
[5035.92s -> 5038.00s]  And you prepare, like, a week for this monster.
[5045.05s -> 5046.01s]  Namely guy did that.
[5046.57s -> 5050.99s]  I thought my fly was down.
[5056.57s -> 5060.41s]  Yeah, you ever see somebody seated getting up that fast and walking at you?
[5060.41s -> 5061.21s]  Oh, get out of there.
[5061.21s -> 5062.89s]  You got to get out of the fucking way.
[5062.89s -> 5063.53s]  You know what I mean?
[5063.53s -> 5066.76s]  Like, it's like, dog, I'm getting out of the way.
[5066.76s -> 5067.40s]  Get out of the way quick.
[5069.58s -> 5071.02s]  This guy got up really fast.
[5071.02s -> 5075.79s]  In the right hands can grant great power to heal or to destroy.
[5075.79s -> 5076.83s]  You hear that, Seren?
[5076.83s -> 5078.27s]  We'll have you better before you know it.
[5078.99s -> 5083.10s]  Karma, the fly was open.
[5084.30s -> 5085.66s]  I must warn you, Gabriel.
[5085.66s -> 5088.49s]  Power to save your horse will come at a price.
[5088.49s -> 5089.53s]  Then I'll pay it.
[5089.53s -> 5090.57s]  Anything to save Seren.
[5090.89s -> 5091.45s]  Very well.
[5094.11s -> 5095.07s]  This horse is dead.
[5095.07s -> 5096.27s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[5096.27s -> 5097.71s]  The horse is going to die in 10 seconds.
[5103.47s -> 5104.03s]  He's dead.
[5120.60s -> 5121.56s]  Leave the animal here.
[5122.76s -> 5123.88s]  Don't be afraid.
[5123.88s -> 5125.24s]  No evil can approach the pool.
[5125.24s -> 5128.92s]  Uh, guy, my connect seat, it's not calibrated.
[5128.92s -> 5129.96s]  It doesn't think I'm sitting here.
[5130.68s -> 5131.16s]  I'm here.
[5131.16s -> 5131.48s]  I'm here.
[5131.48s -> 5132.52s]  I'm here.
[5132.52s -> 5133.00s]  I'm here.
[5133.00s -> 5134.20s]  I'm in the, I'm right here.
[5134.20s -> 5134.68s]  God damn it.
[5134.68s -> 5135.80s]  This thing, I have to recalibrate it.
[5135.80s -> 5136.36s]  I'm right here.
[5136.36s -> 5137.40s]  Oh my god damn it.
[5138.12s -> 5139.64s]  Here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
[5140.52s -> 5142.08s]  I shouldn't have done that.
[5142.08s -> 5142.72s]  I'm gonna puke.
[5143.36s -> 5148.46s]  That's too much spinning.
[5148.46s -> 5152.38s]  We heroes guard the pool and the artifact that lies beneath its surface.
[5153.02s -> 5155.90s]  Blaze, the hero of fire.
[5155.90s -> 5159.58s]  Stone, the hero of the fallen.
[5159.58s -> 5163.07s]  And soul, the hero of light.
[5163.07s -> 5166.59s]  Great champions who long ago...
[5166.59s -> 5167.09s]  What's her?
[5169.55s -> 5174.27s]  Approach the pool.
[5174.27s -> 5175.95s]  I thought that was me doing it.
[5175.95s -> 5176.67s]  No, that isn't me.
[5178.32s -> 5180.08s]  Gaze into the water.
[5180.08s -> 5189.05s]  Means to heal your horseless within the water.
[5189.05s -> 5194.78s]  I have to dunk my head.
[5196.35s -> 5203.87s]  Reach into the pool.
[5203.87s -> 5204.67s]  Oh my god.
[5205.55s -> 5207.34s]  It's so long since I've had water.
[5208.22s -> 5209.64s]  Understand.
[5211.26s -> 5211.82s]  What is this?
[5212.94s -> 5213.90s]  I don't carry much.
[5214.70s -> 5219.74s]  I like to play in water.
[5231.90s -> 5232.86s]  No, not my horse.
[5232.86s -> 5233.82s]  I like that horse.
[5234.38s -> 5234.88s]  No.
[5235.26s -> 5244.36s]  How do you sit like that?
[5244.36s -> 5245.56s]  Wait, what?
[5245.56s -> 5246.06s]  Where am I?
[5247.18s -> 5248.30s]  Where is this, what?
[5248.30s -> 5249.66s]  It wants you to sit like this?
[5249.66s -> 5250.30s]  This is place.
[5251.58s -> 5253.02s]  Welcome, Gabriel.
[5253.02s -> 5253.98s]  What are they talking about?
[5255.34s -> 5257.74s]  The pool has shown you a glimpse of the future.
[5258.75s -> 5261.31s]  But you have been brought here to learn a greater truth.
[5262.83s -> 5266.57s]  Your real trial is only just beginning.
[5266.57s -> 5273.72s]  Bolt is your primary damage spell.
[5273.72s -> 5276.76s]  To cast it, bring your right hand up to your shoulder,
[5276.76s -> 5278.52s]  then thrust it towards your target.
[5279.56s -> 5281.96s]  I look so like just lazy.
[5283.08s -> 5286.60s]  At least it's doing the thing I said.
[5291.32s -> 5300.51s]  Connection system must be calibrated to ensure accurate casting.
[5300.51s -> 5301.55s]  Cast a spell with a statue.
[5302.19s -> 5303.55s]  The entire new statue will appear.
[5305.15s -> 5320.54s]  Good shot.
[5337.50s -> 5342.48s]  Let me just fucking do the thing I want to do.
[5343.12s -> 5351.64s]  You know what's weird about this?
[5353.68s -> 5354.16s]  Casting.
[5354.16s -> 5354.96s]  You cast spells.
[5354.96s -> 5357.12s]  You can go like put your hand up and then go like this.
[5358.08s -> 5360.00s]  Don't you feel like you'd be giving somebody directions
[5360.00s -> 5361.60s]  at some point in the fucking game?
[5361.60s -> 5363.44s]  It's like, oh yeah, the grocery store.
[5363.44s -> 5367.04s]  You want to trot over down to Fairbottom.
[5367.04s -> 5378.68s]  And then just interrupted my fucking joke.
[5378.68s -> 5390.44s]  Whatever.
[5390.44s -> 5392.84s]  Okay, LOL, TLDR.
[5392.84s -> 5394.68s]  I killed a person that I was like over there
[5394.68s -> 5396.28s]  because I was giving directions and pointing around.
[5431.12s -> 5432.56s]  I'm clearly hitting this guy.
[5433.28s -> 5441.68s]  I just hit him.
[5441.68s -> 5456.35s]  Am I not hitting him?
[5456.35s -> 5456.85s]  No!
[5457.71s -> 5480.01s]  This hurts my fucking arm.
[5480.01s -> 5492.57s]  Wait, I can do two?
[5516.49s -> 5518.01s]  Next game, not hold on.
[5528.17s -> 5530.49s]  Don't tell me I'm doing it wrong.
[5530.49s -> 5544.27s]  I was doing it wrong.
[5546.03s -> 5582.17s]  Fuck, it's not even.
[5582.17s -> 5600.91s]  I can't hit that guy.
[5600.91s -> 5601.95s]  I can't hit that guy.
[5601.95s -> 5637.05s]  I can't hit him.
[5637.05s -> 5638.01s]  I'm too close.
[5638.01s -> 5639.21s]  I am not too close.
[5639.85s -> 5652.38s]  I must be dreaming.
[5653.77s -> 5655.05s]  Why was I too close?
[5660.67s -> 5661.31s]  No, I'm not.
[5661.31s -> 5661.95s]  I'm not too close.
[5662.83s -> 5672.80s]  Get me the fuck out of here.
[5678.94s -> 5680.22s]  Actually, what did you say?
[5681.88s -> 5682.60s]  Actually, right.
[5683.24s -> 5685.10s]  I can't take it anymore.
[5685.10s -> 5686.78s]  Connect Resident Sleeper.
[5686.78s -> 5689.39s]  The plot is so good.
[5690.35s -> 5693.77s]  The nominee for 2021 Meltdown?
[5693.77s -> 5694.33s]  No, no, no.
[5694.33s -> 5695.61s]  Push is your other main spell.
[5695.61s -> 5696.25s]  No, I'm good.
[5696.25s -> 5696.73s]  I'm good.
[5696.73s -> 5697.77s]  Bless.
[5697.77s -> 5701.21s]  Raise your left hand up to your shoulder, then thrust forward.
[5701.85s -> 5704.41s]  The spell will knock back your enemies, stunning them
[5704.41s -> 5706.41s]  so they cannot attack for a short while.
[5706.41s -> 5706.97s]  Stunning.
[5706.97s -> 5709.85s]  It can also be used to manipulate the environment.
[5709.85s -> 5732.52s]  Am I not getting a sword?
[5732.52s -> 5751.77s]  I don't know how many people on Christmas morning
[5751.77s -> 5752.73s]  sat here doing this.
[5752.73s -> 5758.49s]  They have a lot of brain power to do this.
[5761.52s -> 5763.04s]  I want to know the collective brain power
[5763.60s -> 5764.96s]  on Christmas morning, everybody doing this.
[5765.76s -> 5768.06s]  Dad, did you figure it out yet?
[5768.06s -> 5769.18s]  I can't say.
[5769.18s -> 5771.10s]  I'm trying to get the calibration to work, son.
[5772.41s -> 5773.45s]  This thing is wild.
[5774.27s -> 5775.71s]  It actually knows where my hand is.
[5783.80s -> 5784.68s]  Oh, I got it.
[5785.88s -> 5787.32s]  You want to try, son?
[5787.32s -> 5788.60s]  Am I really doing it?
[5788.60s -> 5789.10s]  No.
[5789.80s -> 5790.44s]  Are you sure?
[5790.44s -> 5791.40s]  I don't know what's happening.
[5791.40s -> 5792.36s]  No, not really.
[5792.36s -> 5793.88s]  Will, the power of magic.
[5793.88s -> 5794.92s]  It's a lot of fun.
[5794.92s -> 5797.40s]  Ran through the veins of the ancient hero.
[5797.40s -> 5798.60s]  Internal monologue going here.
[5798.60s -> 5801.08s]  This must be like a $200 fucking add-on.
[5802.60s -> 5803.40s]  You don't want to try it?
[5804.60s -> 5807.16s]  I'll be in my room playing my PlayStation.
[5808.43s -> 5808.67s]  Oh.
[5808.67s -> 5811.31s]  The push spell can be used to throw enemies and bits.
[5811.31s -> 5812.83s]  I'll call you in when I get it.
[5812.83s -> 5814.03s]  I think I get to a cool part.
[5814.03s -> 5815.79s]  You can hang out with me.
[5815.79s -> 5818.03s]  And once it is connected, sweep your hand
[5818.03s -> 5819.55s]  in the direction you want to throw.
[5820.51s -> 5843.37s]  Come on, man.
[5844.33s -> 5846.91s]  Come on.
[5846.91s -> 5847.87s]  I got to do this.
[5847.87s -> 5849.71s]  Me and my son are going to hang out together.
[5850.59s -> 5874.89s]  Got it.
[5874.89s -> 5875.61s]  I got it.
[5875.61s -> 5877.24s]  Wow.
[5877.24s -> 5878.36s]  Oh, I can move it around.
[5880.57s -> 5882.97s]  I can move this thing around if I move my arm around.
[5884.68s -> 5885.80s]  Oh, this sure is fun.
[5885.80s -> 5887.56s]  The push spell can be used to throw enemies
[5887.56s -> 5889.48s]  and bits of the environment through the air.
[5890.12s -> 5892.36s]  Cast push with your left hand normally.
[5892.36s -> 5894.52s]  And once it is connected, sweep your hand.
[5894.52s -> 5895.40s]  Oh, what's that?
[5895.40s -> 5896.04s]  What's that, honey?
[5896.04s -> 5898.52s]  We got Snickers ice cream bars too in the freezer?
[5902.54s -> 5903.10s]  Hey, Dad.
[5903.10s -> 5903.82s]  Oh, hey, son.
[5904.54s -> 5905.58s]  Come sit down.
[5905.58s -> 5906.14s]  Come sit down.
[5906.14s -> 5907.58s]  Come sit right next to me.
[5907.58s -> 5908.70s]  Yeah, you see what I got here?
[5908.70s -> 5910.14s]  The push spell can be used to throw enemies
[5910.14s -> 5912.94s]  and bits of the environment through the air.
[5912.94s -> 5914.86s]  Cast push with your left hand normally.
[5921.32s -> 5921.96s]  Dad, get it.
[5925.56s -> 5926.36s]  I got it, son.
[5927.08s -> 5930.20s]  Ow.
[5930.20s -> 5932.20s]  Whoa, yeah, that was crazy what I just did.
[5932.20s -> 5933.96s]  I could make it fly with my hand.
[5940.08s -> 5940.88s]  You want to try?
[5942.00s -> 5942.24s]  No.
[5942.80s -> 5944.48s]  Can I have another Snickers ice cream bar?
[5945.20s -> 5949.48s]  Um, yes.
[5949.48s -> 5950.12s]  Yes, you can.
[5950.92s -> 5951.64s]  Really?
[5951.64s -> 5952.44s]  Yes, you can.
[5953.24s -> 5954.36s]  Honey, don't.
[5954.36s -> 5955.08s]  He's had three.
[5957.55s -> 5958.51s]  How many are in a box?
[5959.15s -> 5960.75s]  There are only four in a box.
[5960.75s -> 5961.63s]  It's bullshit.
[5964.65s -> 5966.89s]  All right, how about you can have one more, son.
[5967.37s -> 5969.37s]  Why don't you take a look at what your dear old dad can do here.
[5970.09s -> 5982.92s]  Okay, I think I'm done.
[5982.92s -> 5983.96s]  I'm done watching.
[5983.96s -> 5984.46s]  What?
[5986.67s -> 5988.11s]  No more ice cream to keep up here.
[5992.78s -> 5993.28s]  Connect.
[5994.14s -> 5994.64s]  Rack.
[6018.56s -> 6039.80s]  How do I get the fuck out of here?
[6042.99s -> 6044.51s]  Actually, I have a little sore.
[6045.87s -> 6054.28s]  I'll get it.
[6054.28s -> 6054.92s]  I'll get it.
[6055.64s -> 6056.75s]  I'll get it.
[6056.75s -> 6057.63s]  Don't worry, son.
[6058.35s -> 6059.16s]  Don't worry.
[6059.16s -> 6059.66s]  I'll get it.
[6065.76s -> 6066.26s]  Skeleton.
[6066.80s -> 6067.52s]  What's that?
[6067.52s -> 6069.04s]  Why is there a skeleton on the couch?
[6071.53s -> 6072.03s]  Honey?
[6072.49s -> 6079.42s]  How long has it been that I've been sitting here for?
[6080.38s -> 6084.73s]  How long has it been?
[6085.29s -> 6089.93s]  Is there a skeleton over there?
[6089.93s -> 6101.71s]  I'm done.
[6101.71s -> 6125.36s]  All right, wait.
[6125.36s -> 6132.44s]  Is it time to play Let's Cheer?
[6132.44s -> 6136.96s]  Is it time to play Let's Cheer?
[6136.96s -> 6143.32s]  I'll be right back.
[6143.32s -> 6148.94s]  I'm gonna get some water.
[6148.94s -> 6150.94s]  That was absolutely fucking dreadful.
[6150.94s -> 6154.62s]  I'll be right back.
[6154.62s -> 6353.24s]  You know, I talked a lot of shit about, uh, about that game.
[6353.24s -> 6355.16s]  The more that I thought about it when I had a glass of water,
[6355.80s -> 6359.88s]  you know, the more that I think the Connect has a peripheral.
[6361.21s -> 6367.55s]  It's probably so limited that it'd be like trying to code Skyrim on an Atari.
[6368.19s -> 6371.56s]  You kind of just can't.
[6371.56s -> 6379.32s]  Like, what can we have people do?
[6379.96s -> 6382.04s]  Okay, they can wave their hands in the air,
[6383.12s -> 6386.06s]  and it can recognize their face,
[6387.95s -> 6392.20s]  and it has a microphone.
[6392.20s -> 6394.76s]  So if you make noises, it can tell.
[6394.76s -> 6399.55s]  Is there copyright music in this?
[6400.19s -> 6401.95s]  I feel like I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.
[6401.95s -> 6403.61s]  We're about to find out.
[6405.66s -> 6406.62s]  I need to tune this.
[6406.62s -> 6407.90s]  Move this out of the way.
[6407.90s -> 6411.80s]  There's probably a shitload of copyrighted music in here.
[6411.80s -> 6420.41s]  Is this the correct gamer?
[6420.41s -> 6420.97s]  All right, here we go.
[6421.53s -> 6434.88s]  Okay, it's called Cheers.
[6435.52s -> 6437.45s]  The correct gamer?
[6437.45s -> 6437.77s]  It is.
[6438.41s -> 6442.72s]  It's called Let's Cheer.
[6443.44s -> 6450.06s]  Ready to save.
[6450.78s -> 6454.73s]  All right, this is going to be probably very embarrassing.
[6454.73s -> 6456.09s]  All right, so let's squad captain.
[6456.09s -> 6456.81s]  Here's where you pick your squad captain.
[6456.81s -> 6458.49s]  This is the person who stands up front,
[6458.49s -> 6461.77s]  and you'll need to watch and follow her exact moves when you're doing the routines.
[6461.77s -> 6462.09s]  Okay.
[6462.09s -> 6463.37s]  Once you choose your captain,
[6463.37s -> 6465.37s]  select the confirm button to pick your squad's color.
[6465.37s -> 6468.84s]  Megan, Brianna, or Hayley.
[6469.80s -> 6471.74s]  Okay.
[6471.74s -> 6476.91s]  I just broke the Kinect.
[6482.17s -> 6482.57s]  What did I say?
[6482.57s -> 6483.37s]  I've seen a lot of Megan.
[6484.17s -> 6485.21s]  I've seen a lot of Megan.
[6486.25s -> 6487.74s]  All right, Megan's captain.
[6488.62s -> 6490.62s]  Confirm.
[6490.62s -> 6492.94s]  The other two are locked.
[6494.54s -> 6495.50s]  Squad colors.
[6495.50s -> 6496.86s]  Go ahead and pick any of the colors on the right.
[6496.86s -> 6499.58s]  Both your colors and squad captain can be changed at any time,
[6499.58s -> 6501.26s]  so feel free to mix it up later on.
[6506.88s -> 6507.12s]  Go.
[6508.00s -> 6509.68s]  Selecting Cheers will get us started.
[6509.68s -> 6510.24s]  Cheers?
[6510.24s -> 6513.36s]  Extras is where you can see all your current stats, awards,
[6513.36s -> 6514.24s]  and have some options to...
[6514.24s -> 6516.24s]  Okay.
[6516.24s -> 6519.52s]  Local, district, state, regionals, nationals.
[6519.52s -> 6521.04s]  There are five different levels of competition.
[6521.04s -> 6523.52s]  Local levels will have the easiest chance and dance routines,
[6523.52s -> 6525.52s]  where the national level will contain the hardest.
[6525.52s -> 6528.24s]  Right now, the national level of competition is closed to you,
[6528.24s -> 6529.84s]  but all of the levels are open.
[6529.84s -> 6531.28s]  You can pick any level you would like.
[6531.28s -> 6531.76s]  Okay.
[6531.76s -> 6532.56s]  Well, I'll go first.
[6533.44s -> 6537.28s]  There are several chants and two dance routines to pick from on your right.
[6537.28s -> 6540.64s]  Some items are locked and will be unlocked as you do well in the corresponding sections.
[6540.64s -> 6541.44s]  Shoot for two.
[6541.44s -> 6542.16s]  Celebration.
[6542.16s -> 6544.16s]  Now choose one that sounds good to you, and we can get started.
[6544.72s -> 6545.92s]  Okay.
[6545.92s -> 6547.88s]  Defense up.
[6548.68s -> 6554.97s]  Local football.
[6554.97s -> 6556.81s]  This is a great football chant to start with.
[6556.81s -> 6559.21s]  It has simple movements that should be easy for you to do.
[6560.49s -> 6561.37s]  Great.
[6562.01s -> 6563.29s]  Let's just find out how to do it first.
[6564.89s -> 6565.53s]  So loud.
[6566.33s -> 6568.27s]  Here comes DMCA.
[6568.27s -> 6568.59s]  Is it?
[6569.31s -> 6574.59s]  Are we going to get DMCA?
[6575.23s -> 6577.79s]  Six, seven, eight.
[6577.79s -> 6578.59s]  Defense.
[6579.15s -> 6579.79s]  Attack.
[6580.35s -> 6580.91s]  It's slow.
[6580.91s -> 6581.63s]  Push.
[6581.63s -> 6581.79s]  Defense.
[6581.79s -> 6582.19s]  Back.
[6582.19s -> 6582.99s]  Offense.
[6582.99s -> 6583.31s]  Back.
[6584.60s -> 6584.84s]  Defense.
[6584.84s -> 6585.88s]  Defense.
[6585.88s -> 6586.04s]  Attack.
[6586.04s -> 6586.92s]  Do I have to sing it too?
[6587.64s -> 6588.20s]  Push.
[6588.20s -> 6588.68s]  This is so slow.
[6588.68s -> 6589.88s]  That offense back.
[6589.88s -> 6590.76s]  This needs to be faster.
[6590.76s -> 6592.28s]  It needs to be defense.
[6592.28s -> 6592.68s]  Attack.
[6592.68s -> 6593.40s]  Attack.
[6593.40s -> 6594.60s]  Push that offense back.
[6594.60s -> 6595.40s]  Why is this so slow?
[6595.40s -> 6597.00s]  Push that offense back.
[6597.00s -> 6597.16s]  Back.
[6598.04s -> 6605.40s]  Let's crank up the speed a bit and turn on the score feedback.
[6605.40s -> 6606.20s]  Okay.
[6606.20s -> 6608.20s]  Six, seven, eight.
[6608.20s -> 6609.24s]  Defense.
[6609.24s -> 6609.80s]  Attack.
[6610.60s -> 6611.24s]  Push.
[6611.24s -> 6612.52s]  That offense back.
[6613.56s -> 6614.68s]  Defense.
[6614.68s -> 6615.88s]  Attack.
[6615.88s -> 6616.60s]  Push.
[6616.60s -> 6617.80s]  That offense back.
[6617.80s -> 6619.96s]  This is like, this dude is like daycare.
[6619.96s -> 6620.04s]  Defense.
[6620.04s -> 6620.52s]  Attack.
[6621.24s -> 6624.40s]  Push.
[6624.72s -> 6625.60s]  I have to sing it, right?
[6633.50s -> 6634.38s]  I can't do that shit.
[6638.32s -> 6639.60s]  I will try to get that.
[6639.60s -> 6640.96s]  I'm going to wreck my pants.
[6646.33s -> 6647.61s]  I'm going to do that and you're going to hear...
[6648.97s -> 6651.23s]  All right.
[6651.23s -> 6652.11s]  Let's get fired up.
[6659.34s -> 6659.58s]  I'm ready.
[6659.58s -> 6659.90s]  Let's go.
[6661.02s -> 6673.45s]  I'm just a fan in the audience doing their moves.
[6678.08s -> 6685.08s]  Why is he on a giant birthday cake?
[6686.60s -> 6699.74s]  Oh my God.
[6699.74s -> 6700.22s]  That hurt.
[6709.05s -> 6709.61s]  This game's...
[6710.65s -> 6711.77s]  They're not that long.
[6711.77s -> 6712.73s]  This is so short.
[6713.77s -> 6714.36s]  Okay.
[6714.36s -> 6715.72s]  How about celebration?
[6716.44s -> 6719.08s]  I guess I can have the month break.
[6719.08s -> 6719.80s]  Nah, I'll be fine.
[6724.76s -> 6725.32s]  Okay.
[6725.32s -> 6726.28s]  Um, let's train.
[6727.88s -> 6729.39s]  I'm going to train and I'm going to perform.
[6730.43s -> 6731.36s]  DMCA.
[6731.36s -> 6731.92s]  DMCA.
[6731.92s -> 6732.40s]  DMCA.
[6732.40s -> 6732.64s]  What?
[6740.44s -> 6741.32s]  Wait, is this a real song?
[6750.22s -> 6752.88s]  Why is everything moving?
[6769.88s -> 6770.36s]  Oh shit.
[6770.92s -> 6772.20s]  She's casting fireball.
[6772.84s -> 6798.51s]  This is embarrassing.
[6799.07s -> 6800.03s]  This is embarrassing to me.
[6804.25s -> 6804.81s]  Clock arms.
[6832.12s -> 6832.44s]  Check it.
[6841.80s -> 6843.00s]  Delete this stream.
[6843.00s -> 6845.77s]  Why don't you delete that comment?
[6845.77s -> 6856.75s]  I'm about to rip this one out too.
[6856.75s -> 6857.23s]  This keeps...
[6861.40s -> 6862.60s]  I'm going to go for a competition.
[6865.85s -> 6866.97s]  We're going right to regionals.
[6870.89s -> 6871.13s]  Okay.
[6871.13s -> 6871.21s]  Okay.
[6877.45s -> 6878.01s]  Perform on card.
[6881.61s -> 6882.41s]  This is for regionals.
[6884.25s -> 6885.05s]  I can't do Mickey.
[6885.05s -> 6886.01s]  I'm going to get arrested.
[6887.32s -> 6888.60s]  If I do Mickey, I'm going to get arrested
[6888.60s -> 6889.56s]  because I got DMCA.
[6890.68s -> 6908.64s]  I'm just the guy in the front row on drugs.
[6908.64s -> 6910.11s]  The concert.
[6918.65s -> 6919.77s]  That's not that long.
[6919.77s -> 6921.45s]  It needs to be much longer than that.
[6922.41s -> 6926.36s]  It's like, oh, that guy is...
[6926.36s -> 6926.92s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[6934.03s -> 6935.15s]  I was trying to get...
[6935.15s -> 6935.95s]  I was trying to get in the...
[6941.45s -> 6944.41s]  Somebody like snatched me.
[6944.41s -> 6945.61s]  Somebody snatched me.
[6945.61s -> 6946.65s]  I was in the middle
[6946.65s -> 6947.85s]  and like before they took the photo,
[6947.85s -> 6949.45s]  somebody like fucking snatched me
[6949.45s -> 6950.01s]  and pulled me.
[6951.37s -> 6952.81s]  Look at that mouth.
[6960.35s -> 6961.71s]  I can't even look at it.
[6968.94s -> 6969.90s]  Yeah, keep that cover.
[6971.10s -> 6971.50s]  For sure.
[6972.46s -> 6974.86s]  Enough is enough.
[6975.50s -> 6975.74s]  What?
[6976.30s -> 6987.12s]  I'm going to get arrested.
[6987.12s -> 6988.16s]  How about be aggressive?
[6991.45s -> 6991.61s]  Oh.
[6996.81s -> 6998.89s]  That's like a disconnected job.
[6998.89s -> 7000.33s]  It's like a cryptid.
[7000.33s -> 7001.61s]  What the fuck is a cryptid?
[7002.41s -> 7003.02s]  All right.
[7003.02s -> 7003.42s]  I'm ready.
[7007.39s -> 7011.08s]  Be aggressive.
[7011.08s -> 7015.16s]  B-E-A-G-R-E-S-I-V-E.
[7017.16s -> 7017.95s]  Aggressive.
[7019.15s -> 7019.79s]  Aggressive.
[7020.43s -> 7023.71s]  B-E-A-G-G-R-E-S-I-V-E.
[7023.71s -> 7024.35s]  I'm so...
[7024.35s -> 7026.51s]  I'm the fucking annoying person at the concert.
[7026.51s -> 7027.23s]  I can't get over it.
[7028.51s -> 7033.87s]  B-E-E-A-G-G-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E.
[7033.87s -> 7034.51s]  Go get him.
[7035.23s -> 7043.92s]  Come on.
[7043.92s -> 7045.76s]  I'm ready.
[7045.76s -> 7049.96s]  There was no photo?
[7049.96s -> 7053.47s]  Oh, there was no photo.
[7062.72s -> 7064.16s]  Make the sus face.
[7064.16s -> 7064.32s]  No.
[7065.04s -> 7069.31s]  Do Mickey.
[7069.31s -> 7069.87s]  Oh my God.
[7069.87s -> 7070.83s]  I want to do this.
[7070.83s -> 7072.11s]  Disturbia is so bad.
[7072.11s -> 7072.67s]  Cheers here.
[7072.67s -> 7074.19s]  Start to separate the good groups from the bad ones.
[7074.19s -> 7075.55s]  I want to do Disturbia.
[7075.55s -> 7077.07s]  So fucking bad.
[7077.07s -> 7078.59s]  But I'm gonna get in trouble if I do.
[7078.59s -> 7079.95s]  Let's share and let's show them what we got.
[7080.67s -> 7087.69s]  It's a cover?
[7087.69s -> 7088.33s]  That don't matter.
[7088.89s -> 7106.60s]  You want the song?
[7107.64s -> 7111.32s]  Just sing over it.
[7111.32s -> 7111.80s]  Okay, fine.
[7120.73s -> 7121.77s]  Here we go.
[7122.41s -> 7124.03s]  Wait.
[7124.03s -> 7124.27s]  Wait.
[7124.91s -> 7125.80s]  Hold on.
[7126.44s -> 7127.76s]  All right.
[7127.76s -> 7128.48s]  I'll do it.
[7128.48s -> 7129.28s]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[7129.28s -> 7129.60s]  Okay.
[7130.08s -> 7133.10s]  So it's like...
[7135.74s -> 7136.14s]  I got it.
[7159.74s -> 7163.26s]  This is the lyrics.
[7189.74s -> 7207.95s]  This is how they do it when they choreograph, by the way.
[7208.89s -> 7209.69s]  The person...
[7209.69s -> 7210.49s]  I don't even care.
[7210.49s -> 7211.61s]  I don't even give a shit.
[7211.61s -> 7212.01s]  I don't care.
[7212.01s -> 7214.33s]  You have to hear that.
[7214.33s -> 7214.81s]  When you...
[7214.81s -> 7217.29s]  When choreographers are doing a dance routine,
[7218.17s -> 7219.77s]  to the beat, they go like...
[7219.77s -> 7221.69s]  And that's when we get those two arms up
[7222.33s -> 7224.57s]  and you swing with the back shake.
[7224.57s -> 7225.37s]  Step, step.
[7226.67s -> 7250.35s]  I got a feeling.
[7251.55s -> 7253.52s]  What about district?
[7254.08s -> 7256.99s]  You're losing your mind?
[7256.99s -> 7259.23s]  District level cheers are a step above your local.
[7259.23s -> 7261.98s]  They contain slightly harder movements and routines.
[7261.98s -> 7263.82s]  I like to move it, move it.
[7263.82s -> 7265.02s]  I like to move it.
[7265.02s -> 7265.74s]  Do Mickey.
[7273.85s -> 7276.57s]  Why are we not allowed to have any fun anymore?
[7277.37s -> 7286.43s]  I would love to do I like to move it, move it.
[7288.43s -> 7292.03s]  But somewhere there's somebody with a giant fucking cigar
[7292.03s -> 7293.55s]  that they haven't asched yet.
[7293.55s -> 7295.55s]  And it's just like three quarters of ash.
[7296.19s -> 7296.83s]  And they're just like...
[7297.71s -> 7302.22s]  Then they take the cigars, then they...
[7304.38s -> 7305.90s]  They ash it into their own fucking mouth.
[7308.51s -> 7309.79s]  Why can't we have any fun?
[7313.53s -> 7315.13s]  Why can't we have any fun?
[7324.01s -> 7325.61s]  This chat has a few harder moves in it,
[7325.61s -> 7327.37s]  but well worth the results it will bring you
[7327.37s -> 7328.97s]  when your fans are on their feet.
[7329.61s -> 7330.01s]  Like what?
[7330.01s -> 7331.05s]  Because you're going to hear,
[7331.61s -> 7334.09s]  I like to move it, move it on a live stream
[7334.09s -> 7336.41s]  in fucking Let's Cheer the video game.
[7338.44s -> 7339.88s]  No, no, no, no, no, they're not going to go out
[7339.88s -> 7343.16s]  and they're not going to buy that CD from fucking 2008.
[7343.16s -> 7347.80s]  Get out of here.
[7347.80s -> 7352.16s]  When was the last time any of you fucking guys bought a CD?
[7352.72s -> 7357.07s]  How many of you guys just use Spotify and like iTunes and shit?
[7357.63s -> 7362.22s]  Does it really matter if like I hear a song
[7362.22s -> 7366.54s]  from like 15, 20 years ago on a Brad, Brad broadcast?
[7369.98s -> 7372.38s]  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody DMC'd this.
[7373.34s -> 7376.51s]  Like this is a song that, you know, this is on...
[7376.51s -> 7378.43s]  I have the cheer music rights.
[7379.23s -> 7381.55s]  Yeah, I did the Dribble Dribble Hoop Hoop song.
[7382.43s -> 7396.76s]  Sounds like a Wiggles song.
[7403.07s -> 7404.11s]  I want to get another picture.
[7404.99s -> 7406.33s]  I'm going back to Nationals.
[7406.33s -> 7407.21s]  We're doing one more.
[7407.21s -> 7408.57s]  One more and I'm going to move on.
[7409.37s -> 7419.60s]  Boo Star Andy.
[7420.16s -> 7423.45s]  Go to Regionals.
[7424.43s -> 7425.07s]  I want...
[7425.07s -> 7425.95s]  Okay, block out.
[7425.95s -> 7427.15s]  I'm going to try to get five stars
[7427.15s -> 7428.27s]  because I want to get a photo.
[7428.83s -> 7433.64s]  Want to chant to bring that basketball crowd into a frenzy?
[7433.64s -> 7435.80s]  Learn block out and watch them rock out.
[7437.00s -> 7467.55s]  We got four stars.
[7467.55s -> 7483.48s]  Why can't I get...
[7484.04s -> 7487.02s]  Why did I only get one photo?
[7497.02s -> 7499.10s]  Young and old alike will be dancing in the stands
[7499.10s -> 7500.78s]  as you perform this instant classic.
[7502.22s -> 7502.86s]  Hey, the words.
[7507.56s -> 7508.20s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[7508.20s -> 7508.60s]  Ready?
[7509.79s -> 7511.07s]  Okay, girls, are you ready?
[7512.27s -> 7513.31s]  Here we go.
[7513.31s -> 7517.77s]  It's time for us just to do Mickey at our competition.
[7521.24s -> 7522.04s]  No, no, no.
[7522.04s -> 7522.76s]  I'll just sing it, girls.
[7522.76s -> 7523.24s]  Don't worry.
[7526.67s -> 7535.02s]  Hey, without music, this looks fucking really weird.
[7535.02s -> 7536.38s]  I look like a fucking creep.
[7544.52s -> 7547.23s]  I can't do this.
[7548.11s -> 7554.89s]  Who can't fuck it?
[7554.89s -> 7559.05s]  I don't give a shit.
[7559.77s -> 7566.64s]  I do, I do, I really do.
[7566.64s -> 7570.16s]  I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.
[7570.16s -> 7570.88s]  I do, oh, I do.
[7585.47s -> 7586.35s]  Too late.
[7586.35s -> 7586.85s]  Oh, no.
[7588.75s -> 7594.99s]  I'm sorry, I'll never do it again.
[7604.30s -> 7605.10s]  I didn't get one.
[7617.88s -> 7619.56s]  I'm done with the cheer game.
[7619.56s -> 7627.66s]  It wasn't very Mickey of you.
[7629.77s -> 7630.41s]  You're sweating.
[7630.41s -> 7631.61s]  Yeah, well, I'm getting up and moving.
[7632.17s -> 7644.68s]  What's next?
[7644.68s -> 7645.48s]  Hmm.
[7645.48s -> 7657.55s]  Oh, I know.
[7657.55s -> 7658.27s]  Take a shower?
[7658.27s -> 7659.31s]  Hold on, not yet.
[7659.31s -> 7666.70s]  Star Wars Connect?
[7666.70s -> 7667.90s]  I can't even play that one either.
[7668.46s -> 7674.75s]  Do an armpit check?
[7674.75s -> 7675.39s]  No, thank you.
[7675.95s -> 7686.92s]  No, thank you.
[7689.00s -> 7690.84s]  This one is called UFC Trainer.
[7692.41s -> 7693.45s]  Oh, come on.
[7693.45s -> 7694.49s]  Update in progress.
[7695.29s -> 7710.30s]  I have a tantrum.
[7711.52s -> 7714.48s]  In the sea of comments, I saw somebody say, you're an adult.
[7715.20s -> 7722.38s]  A lot of text.
[7725.90s -> 7727.42s]  I can't be an adult and use the Kinect.
[7727.42s -> 7728.46s]  That's what they made this for.
[7730.17s -> 7734.57s]  This was made for six-year-olds and like 40-plus-year-olds.
[7735.76s -> 7738.00s]  I fit into the category of people that want to have this.
[7738.64s -> 7740.24s]  What are you talking about?
[7740.24s -> 7742.08s]  Everyone says, oh, grandma, grandma.
[7742.08s -> 7744.57s]  Kinect is the grandma accessory.
[7744.57s -> 7746.73s]  Don't I hit the threshold of being old enough to play this?
[7760.16s -> 7761.12s]  Yeah, oh, sad.
[7761.68s -> 7763.58s]  Good company.
[7763.58s -> 7767.82s]  They work.
[7767.82s -> 7768.78s]  40-year-old streamer?
[7768.78s -> 7769.26s]  Not yet.
[7770.92s -> 7773.00s]  I got some years in me here.
[7774.40s -> 7775.52s]  All right, UFC Trainer.
[7780.00s -> 7780.64s]  This is like a...
[7782.14s -> 7783.82s]  All right, this is like part of my body.
[7785.98s -> 7787.98s]  That's in a really weird spot, too.
[7787.98s -> 7789.34s]  I don't like where that is.
[7789.34s -> 7790.46s]  I don't like where that is.
[7791.10s -> 7792.30s]  I don't like where that is.
[7792.30s -> 7793.26s]  I don't like where this is.
[7794.14s -> 7795.66s]  Okay, whatever.
[7797.26s -> 7799.88s]  All right, punch to play.
[7800.52s -> 7801.80s]  It's going to mess stuff up.
[7802.44s -> 7806.84s]  That's kind of cool.
[7807.40s -> 7811.72s]  That was cool.
[7812.28s -> 7813.61s]  Why is my head so hot?
[7814.99s -> 7817.55s]  Why is it a thermal camera and I have like a hot brain?
[7818.27s -> 7819.47s]  Am I going to explode?
[7820.27s -> 7823.05s]  What was that?
[7823.69s -> 7827.39s]  I have like a really like a heat.
[7827.39s -> 7828.35s]  My head is so hot.
[7838.16s -> 7841.12s]  Oh, you know when you have to hold it for more than a few seconds.
[7841.12s -> 7841.36s]  That's...
[7846.68s -> 7849.40s]  Enter your age, height, and weight, please.
[7849.40s -> 7856.67s]  Come on, hurry up.
[7856.67s -> 7862.32s]  All right, that's...
[7864.06s -> 7864.30s]  Oh.
[7866.59s -> 7868.43s]  Would you like to use weights during your workout?
[7871.29s -> 7872.65s]  Should I lie and just say I'm doing it?
[7879.69s -> 7884.16s]  Oh.
[7884.16s -> 7886.08s]  The road to the octagon starts here.
[7886.08s -> 7887.36s]  I'm not doing any of these.
[7887.36s -> 7888.32s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[7888.32s -> 7889.20s]  What do you mean test?
[7889.92s -> 7891.93s]  Fitness test?
[7892.73s -> 7898.59s]  Take your pulse over 15 seconds.
[7898.59s -> 7898.91s]  What?
[7904.14s -> 7904.54s]  No one...
[7904.54s -> 7905.90s]  I'm doing this in jeans.
[7905.90s -> 7908.62s]  ...in maintaining a UFC body would be easy.
[7908.62s -> 7910.68s]  It takes a lot of hard work.
[7910.68s -> 7911.24s]  It also takes...
[7911.24s -> 7912.44s]  A lot of hard work.
[7912.44s -> 7915.88s]  ...preparing properly will not only result.
[7915.88s -> 7917.40s]  It'll reduce your chance of injury.
[7917.48s -> 7919.32s]  So what kind of preparation am I talking about?
[7920.72s -> 7925.29s]  What happened to my fucking fitness DVD?
[7925.29s -> 7925.61s]  I don't know.
[7925.61s -> 7926.33s]  What was it?
[7926.33s -> 7926.89s]  I need to know.
[7931.31s -> 7932.51s]  Oh, so this is what I'm talking about.
[7932.51s -> 7935.23s]  Oh, we're over here now.
[7935.95s -> 7940.60s]  Oh, you burnt the CD.
[7940.60s -> 7941.56s]  You burnt the CD.
[7942.36s -> 7945.08s]  You burnt the DVD, but you took it out before it was done burning.
[7945.08s -> 7947.24s]  So I only got the first like fucking 12 seconds.
[7947.24s -> 7951.16s]  ...in front of the Kinect with your body facing sideways toward the sensor.
[7951.16s -> 7953.72s]  Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[7954.52s -> 7957.37s]  You just...
[7957.37s -> 7960.92s]  Oh, I have to lie.
[7960.92s -> 7962.28s]  You're not going to be able to even see me.
[7963.08s -> 7971.61s]  How do I do this?
[7972.73s -> 7974.43s]  I got to move the mic.
[7974.43s -> 7975.15s]  The mic's got to move.
[7975.79s -> 7980.12s]  Why am I so hot?
[7984.36s -> 7985.24s]  Oh my god.
[7985.24s -> 7986.04s]  What's going on?
[7995.31s -> 7995.55s]  Okay.
[8000.44s -> 8001.64s]  Now for the sit-up test.
[8001.64s -> 8002.20s]  Sit-up test.
[8004.68s -> 8005.40s]  What do I need to do?
[8005.40s -> 8009.48s]  ...on your back, knees bent, and arms crossed in front of your chest.
[8009.48s -> 8013.00s]  Lift your upper body up so that your elbows almost touch your knees.
[8013.00s -> 8015.24s]  You'll have 60 seconds to see how many you can do.
[8015.24s -> 8015.48s]  Okay.
[8016.76s -> 8018.30s]  What's the world record?
[8018.30s -> 8018.62s]  Ready?
[8019.50s -> 8019.66s]  Go.
[8021.90s -> 8022.78s]  60 seconds.
[8023.66s -> 8031.84s]  Nice.
[8031.84s -> 8032.48s]  Yeah.
[8032.48s -> 8037.85s]  Stop if you're tired.
[8041.95s -> 8048.33s]  I'm getting thrown out of the gym.
[8049.45s -> 8052.83s]  30 seconds left.
[8056.83s -> 8057.55s]  Looking good.
[8066.99s -> 8067.95s]  Stop if you're tired.
[8070.46s -> 8072.25s]  I got it.
[8072.25s -> 8072.81s]  20 seconds left.
[8073.61s -> 8080.86s]  I got to get to 20.
[8080.86s -> 8081.50s]  Okay, stop.
[8082.83s -> 8083.23s]  Whoo.
[8085.21s -> 8089.29s]  Lower your body into a plank position with your head facing the connect sensor.
[8089.29s -> 8091.85s]  Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[8095.23s -> 8095.87s]  Okay.
[8095.87s -> 8101.80s]  Push-up test.
[8101.80s -> 8104.81s]  I'm going to try to get 100.
[8104.81s -> 8107.77s]  ...with hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
[8107.77s -> 8109.05s]  I hope I can flat my weight.
[8109.05s -> 8110.17s]  ...attractive.
[8110.17s -> 8112.65s]  Head looking down and slightly ahead of you.
[8113.21s -> 8117.85s]  Slowly lower your chest to the ground, keeping your body rigid.
[8117.85s -> 8118.97s]  Do you guys even see me?
[8118.97s -> 8120.80s]  ...push back to plank.
[8120.80s -> 8123.20s]  You've got one minute to try to do as many as you can.
[8123.68s -> 8125.60s]  All right, you ready?
[8125.60s -> 8126.76s]  Ready?
[8126.76s -> 8127.40s]  Go.
[8127.40s -> 8130.06s]  60 seconds.
[8131.18s -> 8139.56s]  Bring it.
[8143.31s -> 8145.10s]  Stop if you're tired.
[8149.05s -> 8149.77s]  Keep it going.
[8151.13s -> 8151.69s]  I just want to...
[8154.24s -> 8154.80s]  Awesome.
[8157.23s -> 8160.17s]  30 seconds left.
[8161.29s -> 8163.53s]  I got to hit the spot where it thinks I'm moving up and down.
[8164.25s -> 8164.75s]  Again.
[8178.86s -> 8180.06s]  I can't do any more.
[8180.06s -> 8180.86s]  I can't do any more.
[8181.42s -> 8182.30s]  I can't do any more.
[8185.08s -> 8185.58s]  Okay.
[8189.45s -> 8190.09s]  22.
[8192.16s -> 8195.12s]  Stand in front of the Kinect with your body facing toward the sensor.
[8195.12s -> 8198.08s]  Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[8198.08s -> 8199.84s]  For these?
[8200.46s -> 8203.45s]  Okay, last test.
[8204.09s -> 8205.77s]  We need your active heart rate.
[8205.77s -> 8208.91s]  We're going to do some jumping jacks to get your heart rate up.
[8208.91s -> 8212.11s]  Let your arms hang at your side with your feet shoulder width apart.
[8213.26s -> 8214.70s]  Oh no, it's opposite.
[8214.70s -> 8217.50s]  Jump, bringing your arms up and spreading your legs.
[8217.50s -> 8220.22s]  We're going to do this for one minute to get your heart pumping.
[8220.22s -> 8223.42s]  Once we are done with the jumping jacks, I want you to check your pulse again.
[8223.42s -> 8224.46s]  I'll tell you when.
[8224.46s -> 8225.18s]  I don't know how to do that.
[8225.18s -> 8225.68s]  Ready?
[8226.30s -> 8226.80s]  Go.
[8228.70s -> 8229.50s]  60 seconds.
[8238.59s -> 8239.09s]  Good.
[8239.55s -> 8241.60s]  That's a four.
[8243.64s -> 8244.60s]  Stop if you're tired.
[8253.47s -> 8254.41s]  Then do it.
[8257.64s -> 8259.69s]  30 seconds left.
[8262.17s -> 8262.67s]  Hey.
[8263.48s -> 8263.96s]  Hey, can I...
[8263.96s -> 8264.36s]  Oh, okay.
[8264.36s -> 8265.16s]  All right, all right, all right.
[8265.80s -> 8274.97s]  If you're tired.
[8274.97s -> 8279.68s]  10 seconds left.
[8284.25s -> 8284.75s]  70.
[8286.44s -> 8286.94s]  Woo.
[8288.68s -> 8290.52s]  Now I'm going to count down from 15.
[8290.52s -> 8292.60s]  I want you to count how many times you feel a beat.
[8293.80s -> 8294.76s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[8294.76s -> 8295.32s]  All right, I'm ready.

[8300.51s -> 8301.01s]  Go.
[8301.56s -> 8304.12s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[8304.12s -> 8306.33s]  Well, 30, 40, 50, 60.
[8306.33s -> 8308.99s]  Ready to roll?
[8308.99s -> 8310.49s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[8312.67s -> 8315.50s]  Nine, 15, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[8315.50s -> 8316.00s]  15.
[8316.00s -> 8316.50s]  15.
[8316.50s -> 8317.00s]  Stop.
[8317.00s -> 8318.46s]  Please input the amount of beats you count.
[8326.46s -> 8326.96s]  Just like...
[8328.94s -> 8330.54s]  My heart would fucking fly away.
[8331.18s -> 8332.22s]  All right, what am I doing?
[8332.22s -> 8332.72s]  Five.
[8334.92s -> 8336.36s]  Hey, that didn't even win me.
[8343.77s -> 8346.33s]  Hey, bro, uh, go to the hospital.
[8346.33s -> 8358.03s]  That's... wait, that's only five?
[8358.83s -> 8376.09s]  Here's a summary of your personal information.
[8376.09s -> 8376.65s]  Whatever.
[8376.65s -> 8377.69s]  Not one of my personal information.
[8381.24s -> 8381.74s]  All right.
[8383.24s -> 8383.74s]  Activity.
[8385.64s -> 8386.14s]  No.
[8388.28s -> 8389.66s]  All right, hit the mitts.
[8390.46s -> 8394.32s]  I can't with your speed bag.
[8394.32s -> 8395.28s]  That's going to be so much fun.
[8395.28s -> 8396.16s]  Select a fighter.
[8398.62s -> 8399.26s]  Dan Hardy.
[8402.56s -> 8403.52s]  Select a routine.
[8404.08s -> 8405.36s]  Uh, we're going to go with...
[8405.36s -> 8406.24s]  I can do better than that.
[8409.88s -> 8410.38s]  Really?
[8410.76s -> 8418.09s]  All right, we're going to do easy routine five.
[8435.96s -> 8437.00s]  Oh, wait, wait, I got to do that too.
[8438.89s -> 8446.25s]  Stand in front of the Kinect with your body facing toward the sensor.
[8446.25s -> 8448.89s]  Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[8451.82s -> 8452.38s]  What's up?
[8452.38s -> 8453.42s]  I'm Dan Hardy.
[8453.42s -> 8454.54s]  Let's work focus bits.
[8456.57s -> 8458.81s]  All right, we're going to do some jabs and crosses.
[8458.81s -> 8459.85s]  Mixing it up with hooks.
[8459.85s -> 8460.35s]  All right.
[8460.49s -> 8462.01s]  A few kicks and some knees.
[8462.01s -> 8462.51s]  And some knees.
[8462.51s -> 8463.39s]  To keep you on your toes.
[8463.39s -> 8465.31s]  I'm going to give you something to dodge every now and then.
[8465.31s -> 8465.81s]  All right.
[8466.19s -> 8467.79s]  Are you ready to train like a champ?
[8467.79s -> 8468.29s]  Oh.
[8470.26s -> 8470.76s]  Jab.
[8472.66s -> 8473.16s]  Duck.
[8473.30s -> 8475.33s]  Take a bit more now.
[8475.33s -> 8475.83s]  No.
[8475.83s -> 8476.61s]  Keep moving.
[8476.61s -> 8477.11s]  Kick.

[8497.38s -> 8497.88s]  Jab.
[8498.18s -> 8498.68s]  Cross.
[8498.74s -> 8500.24s]  Hook.
[8500.24s -> 8500.78s]  I got an idea.
[8501.18s -> 8503.02s]  Get it back and let's get to it.
[8503.02s -> 8503.98s]  We're going to mix it up now.
[8508.61s -> 8509.11s]  Jab.
[8509.81s -> 8510.31s]  Jab.
[8510.53s -> 8511.03s]  Duck.
[8511.81s -> 8512.37s]  Good job.
[8512.37s -> 8513.17s]  Way to go.
[8513.17s -> 8513.67s]  Jab.

[8520.10s -> 8520.60s]  Yes.
[8520.60s -> 8521.54s]  That's how it's done.
[8521.54s -> 8522.04s]  Okay.
[8522.10s -> 8522.82s]  Let's move on.
[8529.47s -> 8529.97s]  Jab.
[8530.27s -> 8530.77s]  Duck.
[8531.15s -> 8531.95s]  I don't want to duck.
[8531.95s -> 8532.75s]  Dig deeper now.
[8533.31s -> 8533.81s]  Jab.
[8533.95s -> 8534.45s]  Jab.

[8553.26s -> 8554.06s]  I'm tired.
[8554.70s -> 8555.20s]  Jab.
[8555.26s -> 8555.76s]  I'm tired.
[8555.76s -> 8556.26s]  I need a break.
[8556.62s -> 8557.34s]  I need a break.
[8557.34s -> 8557.84s]  Cross.
[8557.84s -> 8558.46s]  I need a break.
[8559.89s -> 8560.39s]  Kick.
[8560.39s -> 8561.09s]  You're not listening.
[8561.73s -> 8562.79s]  Hook.
[8562.79s -> 8563.73s]  I need a fucking break, man.
[8563.73s -> 8564.23s]  Knee.
[8564.69s -> 8565.19s]  Connect.
[8565.19s -> 8565.89s]  I need a break.
[8565.89s -> 8568.43s]  You've got to keep moving.
[8568.43s -> 8568.93s]  Jab.
[8568.93s -> 8569.43s]  Jab.
[8569.43s -> 8570.17s]  How am I going to take a break?
[8570.17s -> 8570.67s]  Duck.
[8570.67s -> 8576.62s]  Looking good.
[8577.34s -> 8577.84s]  Okay.
[8577.84s -> 8578.78s]  We're going to change it up.
[8585.14s -> 8585.64s]  Jab.
[8585.86s -> 8586.36s]  Jab.
[8586.98s -> 8587.48s]  Duck.
[8587.78s -> 8589.78s]  I think you can do better.
[8589.94s -> 8590.44s]  Jab.
[8590.66s -> 8591.16s]  Let him hit me.
[8591.16s -> 8591.94s]  I get more rage.
[8592.34s -> 8595.89s]  Duck.
[8595.89s -> 8596.39s]  Knee.
[8596.59s -> 8597.76s]  You really got it.
[8598.56s -> 8601.60s]  All right.
[8601.60s -> 8602.86s]  I don't know what happened.
[8602.86s -> 8604.78s]  I guess I need to defragment my hard drive.
[8606.80s -> 8607.30s]  What?
[8615.10s -> 8615.60s]  I got an F.
[8617.17s -> 8618.85s]  I only burned six calories?
[8620.46s -> 8621.66s]  How is that even possible?
[8622.46s -> 8622.96s]  What?
[8623.42s -> 8625.82s]  I burned like a hundred.
[8626.46s -> 8630.02s]  You've got to be shitting me.
[8630.66s -> 8641.02s]  Free striking.
[8641.02s -> 8641.52s]  Let's go.
[8645.09s -> 8645.59s]  Heavy bag.
[8646.53s -> 8647.81s]  Tiger stripes.
[8647.81s -> 8648.31s]  Let's go.
[8651.46s -> 8651.96s]  Advanced.
[8654.32s -> 8655.44s]  I'm advanced.
[8656.88s -> 8658.00s]  If I punched somebody.
[8658.80s -> 8659.76s]  Oh boy.
[8659.76s -> 8665.30s]  Let's go.
[8672.86s -> 8675.82s]  Stand in front of the connect with your body facing toward the sensor.
[8675.82s -> 8678.62s]  Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.
[8678.62s -> 8679.12s]  I'm green.
[8680.77s -> 8684.37s]  Build power and endurance at your own pace and free striking mode.
[8684.37s -> 8684.87s]  Okay.
[8684.87s -> 8687.73s]  Work on your own combos and at your own pace.
[8687.73s -> 8689.41s]  The more strikes you get in the better.
[8690.94s -> 8691.44s]  Ready?
[8692.83s -> 8693.33s]  Go.
[8693.95s -> 8701.86s]  Quick.
[8702.08s -> 8729.92s]  Pulverize the target.
[8729.92s -> 8750.75s]  Rise the target.
[8754.34s -> 8754.84s]  Come on.
[8756.69s -> 8758.13s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8759.01s -> 8764.54s]  Strike faster.
[8770.70s -> 8771.58s]  Don't let me down.
[8771.58s -> 8773.10s]  Keep attacking.
[8773.10s -> 8774.24s]  All right.
[8774.24s -> 8774.74s]  I'm done.
[8777.73s -> 8779.17s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8779.89s -> 8786.16s]  Strike faster.
[8786.16s -> 8788.63s]  All right.
[8788.63s -> 8789.73s]  I think I killed them.
[8790.29s -> 8791.09s]  I think they're dead.
[8791.81s -> 8793.97s]  Don't let me keep attacking.
[8793.97s -> 8797.60s]  You picked five minutes.
[8798.85s -> 8800.29s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8800.93s -> 8806.78s]  Strike faster.
[8819.94s -> 8821.38s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8827.01s -> 8834.24s]  Strike faster.
[8834.24s -> 8835.68s]  It's like toilet paper roll.
[8841.65s -> 8843.09s]  He's got oh no he's got a fuel.
[8844.05s -> 8847.62s]  This thing's weight like a pound.
[8848.26s -> 8863.15s]  Don't let me down.
[8863.15s -> 8869.26s]  Keep attacking.
[8869.26s -> 8870.70s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8876.34s -> 8877.22s]  Strike faster.
[8877.94s -> 8884.18s]  Don't let me down.

[8890.34s -> 8891.78s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8897.42s -> 8898.30s]  Strike faster.
[8904.48s -> 8905.12s]  Don't let me down.
[8905.12s -> 8905.62s]  Die.
[8906.56s -> 8912.83s]  Your hits are nice and quick.
[8913.63s -> 8919.65s]  Pulverize the target.
[8920.29s -> 8927.02s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8927.02s -> 8928.54s]  It's been how long I have to do this for?
[8930.91s -> 8931.87s]  Five full minutes?
[8932.43s -> 8933.55s]  I think I've been here for an hour.
[8934.35s -> 8938.69s]  I feel like I've been here for a full hour doing this.
[8939.25s -> 8940.62s]  I'm getting to 30,000.
[8940.62s -> 8946.75s]  Keep attacking.
[8946.75s -> 8948.19s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8953.81s -> 8954.93s]  Strike faster.
[8954.93s -> 8967.84s]  Bring that target up.
[8967.84s -> 8968.72s]  Don't let me down.
[8968.72s -> 8971.46s]  Keep attacking.
[8971.46s -> 8972.26s]  Give it a kiss.
[8974.85s -> 8976.37s]  Keep that striking pace up.
[8979.10s -> 8980.62s]  It's like a ranged attack.
[8980.62s -> 8982.78s]  Like strike faster.
[8982.78s -> 8986.56s]  Ow.
[8986.56s -> 8995.78s]  It's a fucking waste of time.
[8996.74s -> 8996.90s]  All right.
[8996.90s -> 8998.34s]  How many calories did that burn?
[8999.06s -> 8999.56s]  What?
[9002.51s -> 9003.79s]  16 calories?
[9004.51s -> 9008.06s]  That was five minutes of just fucking spinning around like a psycho.
[9009.44s -> 9013.52s]  Five full minutes of just waving my arms around and jumping around at 16 calories?
[9015.15s -> 9015.47s]  What?
[9020.29s -> 9020.77s]  No way.
[9021.41s -> 9029.41s]  I feel like I burned more calories playing a horror game.
[9029.97s -> 9032.83s]  I swear to God.
[9032.83s -> 9035.71s]  I bet you I burned 40 calories an hour playing like Resident Evil.
[9036.83s -> 9039.86s]  All right.
[9039.86s -> 9040.74s]  I'm going to speed back.
[9041.86s -> 9042.90s]  I'm getting fucking tired.
[9044.58s -> 9046.18s]  I'm not doing that for five goddamn minutes.
[9053.74s -> 9055.10s]  20 beats per minute.
[9055.98s -> 9061.33s]  Lied about height.
[9061.33s -> 9062.53s]  Lied about beats per minute.
[9062.53s -> 9063.57s]  No wonder it's fucked up.
[9065.42s -> 9066.46s]  I didn't lie about height.
[9077.09s -> 9077.73s]  I'm going to be good at this.
[9109.30s -> 9128.62s]  Come on.
[9128.62s -> 9129.18s]  I want to go.
[9130.06s -> 9134.70s]  I want to do it with my feet, but like I can't put my feet on camera.
[9135.74s -> 9136.99s]  I want to do it.
[9136.99s -> 9138.67s]  I'm going to put my light up, my feet up and do it.
[9138.67s -> 9140.35s]  But I'll you want the fuck to clip that.
[9152.99s -> 9153.79s]  Five calories?
[9158.82s -> 9159.06s]  Late?
[9159.87s -> 9160.19s]  When?
[9165.30s -> 9166.02s]  All right.
[9166.02s -> 9171.38s]  I think it's time to move on.
[9178.72s -> 9178.96s]  All right.
[9178.96s -> 9179.36s]  Hold on.
[9179.36s -> 9180.72s]  I want to do tire flip.
[9180.72s -> 9181.76s]  Wait, there's more.
[9181.76s -> 9182.56s]  What else is in this?
[9186.70s -> 9186.94s]  Oh.
[9187.58s -> 9193.86s]  All right.
[9193.86s -> 9194.42s]  Tire flip.
[9194.98s -> 9197.95s]  Tire flip and then I'm moving on to...
[9201.23s -> 9202.11s]  Hole in the wall.
[9202.99s -> 9207.90s]  Oh, we're going to play hole in the wall after this one.
[9207.90s -> 9208.93s]  One minute.
[9208.93s -> 9220.75s]  Pog, pog, pog.
[9220.75s -> 9221.07s]  Is that all?
[9221.07s -> 9221.87s]  I'm seeing a lot of pogs.
[9222.43s -> 9226.82s]  Jerma's exhausted.
[9226.82s -> 9227.06s]  Yeah.
[9227.06s -> 9229.54s]  I probably shouldn't have picked the like fucking exercise game.
[9230.34s -> 9232.74s]  All the exercise games that are trying to make you like get tired.
[9241.50s -> 9245.18s]  I don't want to do this.
[9245.18s -> 9247.18s]  I don't understand this.
[9251.18s -> 9255.02s]  Dude, I'm just going to eat Cheerios and like reduce some calories and walk.
[9255.58s -> 9256.78s]  I'm not doing this.
[9256.78s -> 9262.70s]  Like just eat fucking like Honey Nut Cheerios or something and walk and jog sometimes.
[9262.70s -> 9264.14s]  I don't want to do this.
[9272.69s -> 9277.55s]  Hole in the wall time.
[9277.95s -> 9283.73s]  Two thousand and twelve Jerma long dead.
[9283.73s -> 9286.45s]  Two thousand and twelve Jerma didn't like flip monster truck tires.
[9287.17s -> 9292.40s]  Broken?
[9292.40s -> 9297.34s]  Whatever.
[9297.34s -> 9298.54s]  No, why?
[9299.68s -> 9300.56s]  I don't want to do that.
[9303.68s -> 9305.12s]  That's like Marvel character shit.
[9305.12s -> 9306.56s]  Like you want to be a Marvel character?
[9308.93s -> 9310.21s]  You can flip like monster truck tires.
[9310.21s -> 9311.01s]  You're a Marvel character.
[9311.01s -> 9312.85s]  You're like Captain America at that point.
[9312.85s -> 9316.32s]  I don't want to be Captain America.
[9316.32s -> 9321.12s]  I want to be guy on sidewalk walking by scene that like looks kind of good.
[9321.12s -> 9322.24s]  I don't want to be Captain America.
[9334.43s -> 9336.67s]  Two thousand and twelve Jerma would beat Captain America's ass.
[9337.62s -> 9343.06s]  No, two thousand and twelve Jerma would take the shield to the head and become decapitated
[9343.62s -> 9346.51s]  because I couldn't duck in time because I don't have superpowers.
[9347.07s -> 9350.85s]  I was just like a like a kind of stacked thick boy.
[9353.10s -> 9354.38s]  My head would come off.
[9354.38s -> 9355.26s]  I don't have powers.
[9360.45s -> 9362.48s]  All right, let's go.
[9363.12s -> 9368.19s]  Why does this font look so bad?
[9368.19s -> 9369.23s]  Connect tuner?
[9369.23s -> 9370.11s]  What's going on there?
[9370.99s -> 9378.05s]  Why is that in a weird font with a weird background?
[9379.01s -> 9379.89s]  All right, let's do it.
[9379.89s -> 9380.45s]  Hole in the wall.
[9381.33s -> 9384.74s]  I'm going to do the show.
[9385.54s -> 9386.88s]  It's a game show.
[9386.88s -> 9387.20s]  Let's go.
[9388.98s -> 9389.54s]  Unplayer.
[9392.70s -> 9395.50s]  Players who want to be in this team, please come over.
[9395.50s -> 9397.66s]  Everyone else, please move away.
[9400.58s -> 9401.70s]  What else?
[9401.70s -> 9402.26s]  Get away.
[9402.90s -> 9405.65s]  You step into the circle to join blue team.
[9406.37s -> 9432.58s]  All right, let's go.
[9438.35s -> 9439.71s]  Everyday life.
[9439.71s -> 9440.91s]  European workplaces.
[9440.91s -> 9442.11s]  Disco activities.
[9445.42s -> 9445.66s]  Art.
[9446.54s -> 9447.42s]  USA.
[9447.42s -> 9448.30s]  Oh, I can only do one.
[9448.94s -> 9452.96s]  All right, we're going to do everyday life.
[9453.76s -> 9455.62s]  Well, how does this game even work?
[9456.26s -> 9456.66s]  Why do you have to...
[9456.66s -> 9458.02s]  Welcome the blue team.
[9465.57s -> 9467.57s]  Oh, I have to get through the foam thing, the hole.
[9468.13s -> 9469.49s]  It's all simple.
[9469.49s -> 9474.93s]  Make the shape, fit the hole, and keep the pose to fill the gauge around the wall.
[9474.93s -> 9477.65s]  The faster you are, the bigger your score.
[9478.37s -> 9481.97s]  If you don't fill the gauge, you get a strike.
[9481.97s -> 9485.09s]  After three strikes, prepare to get wet.
[9488.93s -> 9489.41s]  Here we go.
[9490.21s -> 9491.31s]  Round one.
[9491.31s -> 9491.87s]  Where are we going?
[9491.87s -> 9492.51s]  Where we got?
[9492.51s -> 9494.35s]  I can make my fucking body any form.
[9495.15s -> 9517.44s]  Got it.
[9517.44s -> 9529.15s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[9529.15s -> 9531.62s]  Got it.
[9532.16s -> 9538.26s]  Got it.
[9538.26s -> 9541.22s]  What is this guy doing?
[9564.16s -> 9565.12s]  Get, get, get, get, get.
[9566.00s -> 9574.48s]  All right, round one.
[9575.36s -> 9577.10s]  Round two?
[9578.06s -> 9579.71s]  Wait, there are pictures?
[9579.71s -> 9596.45s]  Oh, there's junk over here.
[9597.09s -> 9599.14s]  Look at all this trash.
[9599.78s -> 9601.70s]  That's supposed to be a dog bed.
[9603.10s -> 9604.30s]  There's a bunch of...
[9604.30s -> 9605.82s]  That's my VR headset.
[9606.38s -> 9607.50s]  And this thing's over here.
[9608.22s -> 9615.47s]  This is a spoiler.
[9616.11s -> 9619.76s]  A spoiler.
[9622.18s -> 9623.06s]  This fucking thing.
[9623.70s -> 9650.66s]  Come on.
[9650.66s -> 9651.78s]  How you doing, man?
[9651.78s -> 9652.58s]  How are things?
[9652.58s -> 9653.78s]  Well, you know, things are good.
[9654.94s -> 9655.82s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[9657.76s -> 9658.96s]  You've been sitting over on the dog bed?
[9659.68s -> 9660.48s]  Yeah.
[9660.48s -> 9662.56s]  Well, you know, the dog bed is comfy.
[9663.73s -> 9664.77s]  I thought that you'd be...
[9665.33s -> 9667.01s]  I was going to wait to put you on stream for a little while.
[9668.43s -> 9668.91s]  You were?
[9669.47s -> 9671.55s]  Yeah, I just figured it wasn't your time yet.
[9672.11s -> 9673.34s]  Why would you do that?
[9673.34s -> 9674.46s]  I'm ready to be on camera.
[9675.42s -> 9675.74s]  Okay.
[9676.30s -> 9678.13s]  What's your name, anyways?
[9679.07s -> 9679.47s]  Orange.
[9680.11s -> 9680.67s]  Oh, easy.
[9680.67s -> 9682.59s]  Really easy to remember and easy to come up with on the spot
[9682.59s -> 9683.79s]  without having any time.
[9683.79s -> 9684.27s]  Cool.
[9684.27s -> 9684.99s]  Hi, Orange.
[9684.99s -> 9686.75s]  So, would you like to go back into dog bed?
[9687.47s -> 9688.51s]  Of course I would.
[9688.51s -> 9689.55s]  It's very comfy.
[9690.11s -> 9692.48s]  Ow, ow.
[9692.48s -> 9700.93s]  I'll do a little bit of cleaning, okay?
[9700.93s -> 9706.86s]  Why am I using my mouse?
[9707.42s -> 9708.62s]  What else we got?
[9708.62s -> 9710.58s]  I'm here.
[9710.58s -> 9714.66s]  I think I'm here.
[9714.66s -> 9718.30s]  How do I get this off the screen?
[9718.30s -> 9738.96s]  What else we got?
[9745.25s -> 9749.44s]  This is so stupid.
[9756.83s -> 9758.35s]  Okay, you know what this looks like.
[9759.79s -> 9760.27s]  What's that...
[9761.07s -> 9762.75s]  What's that kid that dances?
[9764.66s -> 9765.62s]  The kid that goes like...
[9768.75s -> 9769.07s]  What is it?
[9769.07s -> 9769.47s]  He's like...
[9770.03s -> 9773.73s]  That's what the first thing I thought of.
[9773.73s -> 9774.21s]  Dwayne.
[9774.21s -> 9774.77s]  That's right, yep.
[9776.29s -> 9776.69s]  It's like...
[9777.25s -> 9781.54s]  That's the first thing I thought of.
[9786.18s -> 9788.66s]  It looks like somebody's like fucking threatening me to like...
[9790.46s -> 9792.70s]  Yeah, you're a dance.
[9793.50s -> 9796.14s]  Doesn't it look like somebody's gonna fucking kill me off camera?
[9812.45s -> 9813.01s]  Dwayne.
[9814.54s -> 9815.34s]  All right, let's go.
[9815.34s -> 9815.98s]  Let's do another one.
[9815.98s -> 9816.54s]  This is fun.
[9817.18s -> 9818.06s]  I like this one.
[9820.37s -> 9821.89s]  All right, how do we keep going?
[9824.58s -> 9826.34s]  No, that was close.
[9827.14s -> 9831.02s]  Oh, round two.
[9842.22s -> 9842.70s]  Round two.
[9844.06s -> 9846.53s]  Which one am I?
[9878.16s -> 9879.28s]  Shit, shit, shit.
[9880.08s -> 9882.80s]  Okay, got it.
[9894.16s -> 9894.40s]  Okay.
[9894.96s -> 9895.52s]  That was easy.
[9917.90s -> 9918.30s]  Jesus.
[9919.10s -> 9919.81s]  I got it.
[9919.81s -> 9920.69s]  Cleared it.
[9920.69s -> 9927.74s]  Photos time.
[9928.30s -> 9944.05s]  Dump truck.
[9952.64s -> 9953.76s]  Oh my god.
[9955.36s -> 9969.38s]  It looks like I'm wearing a rubber mask of somebody else's face.
[9969.38s -> 9974.38s]  That's a fucking rubber mask.
[9974.38s -> 9985.36s]  Okay, this is just like a shitty...
[9986.70s -> 9989.66s]  This is one of my model photos that I uploaded.
[9989.66s -> 9992.38s]  It's like Instagram to show you like how a bunch of a model I could be.
[9993.02s -> 10000.53s]  Underneath this is like there's two likes.
[10010.24s -> 10013.12s]  Yeah, it's my gallery, you know, my model gallery.
[10013.68s -> 10023.92s]  That one's not even that bad.
[10023.92s -> 10029.52s]  This one looks kind of bad.
[10033.31s -> 10033.95s]  I don't like that one.
[10033.95s -> 10034.59s]  It's scary.
[10035.31s -> 10036.19s]  It's a scary image.
[10036.99s -> 10060.90s]  Why does it always look like somebody took like ice cold hands and like put them on my back?
[10061.38s -> 10070.64s]  All right, let's go again.
[10071.74s -> 10072.54s]  Round five.
[10075.92s -> 10076.56s]  Round three.
[10079.01s -> 10084.22s]  Theresa May.
[10088.62s -> 10094.54s]  That's fucking perfect.
[10102.06s -> 10102.86s]  Oh my god.
[10119.12s -> 10143.30s]  I think I see when it takes the photo.
[10143.86s -> 10149.98s]  Did I get it?
[10149.98s -> 10185.22s]  Hey, I had to go all the way over to the dog bed.
[10185.86s -> 10189.39s]  Why was that so far away?
[10190.27s -> 10213.09s]  Very, very weird.
[10213.09s -> 10216.90s]  I look jacked.
[10216.90s -> 10218.58s]  I look huge in this picture.
[10218.58s -> 10228.69s]  What's going on with my face?
[10233.76s -> 10237.28s]  Just the reddit shelf, just right here.
[10237.28s -> 10239.76s]  It's the only thing in the entire fucking room.
[10240.78s -> 10242.78s]  It just looks so, it just looks so odd.
[10243.50s -> 10247.47s]  There's like shit all over the floor.
[10264.82s -> 10267.62s]  Somebody came in the room, like the T-Rex walked in.
[10268.34s -> 10269.46s]  It didn't matter what I was doing.
[10269.46s -> 10271.54s]  I had to be very still or I was dead.
[10273.22s -> 10278.50s]  Or you don't have a place to put your cardboard cutout of German 985.
[10279.38s -> 10283.30s]  I guess it's just gonna go over here and lean against the wall while I clean the fucking room.
[10283.94s -> 10289.22s]  Like this is, this is like you shoved the cardboard cutout of me and all your other junk
[10289.22s -> 10291.46s]  so you can vacuum over here.
[10292.02s -> 10302.96s]  How is it?
[10302.96s -> 10304.08s]  That was the last one.
[10304.08s -> 10310.38s]  Here comes the final.
[10310.94s -> 10311.90s]  See if I can get it.
[10315.18s -> 10316.62s]  The proudest possession.
[10319.02s -> 10319.58s]  New rule.
[10326.86s -> 10331.18s]  Which of the outline shapes are good and fit them to pass the walls as usual.
[10331.18s -> 10332.06s]  What are you talking about?
[10332.06s -> 10333.26s]  Don't get confused.
[10335.87s -> 10337.39s]  Hole, the holes aren't visible.
[10339.47s -> 10340.59s]  Oh Jesus.
[10351.42s -> 10359.50s]  Which one is it?
[10359.50s -> 10360.22s]  Which one is it?
[10414.67s -> 10415.39s]  It's not this one.
[10415.39s -> 10419.70s]  I'm gonna fall over.
[10430.03s -> 10464.70s]  I can't, what?
[10464.70s -> 10466.70s]  Otto is gonna be in one of these pictures I think.
[10468.22s -> 10469.18s]  Otto came in.
[10484.45s -> 10485.25s]  Let's see if we can see Otto.
[10485.25s -> 10489.34s]  He like ran over here.
[10489.34s -> 10490.54s]  Oh my god.
[10490.54s -> 10492.06s]  Another cardboard cutout.
[10502.24s -> 10507.84s]  Just like a fucking like sprite in my hand in like the 7-Eleven.
[10507.84s -> 10523.90s]  I'm trying to find Otto.
[10534.96s -> 10545.30s]  Oh if you had friends over and these were saved and like this is dad just still playing
[10545.30s -> 10545.94s]  with the Kinect.
[10547.01s -> 10548.77s]  Oh that's where I didn't, I didn't know where it was.
[10552.03s -> 10552.59s]  I can get it.
[10552.59s -> 10553.71s]  I'll try it again.
[10553.71s -> 10557.95s]  Let's go.
[10557.95s -> 10558.43s]  I can do it.
[10559.07s -> 10564.24s]  Oh the show's over.
[10565.70s -> 10566.02s]  What?
[10567.42s -> 10568.46s]  Can I restart that one?
[10572.03s -> 10578.05s]  Oh god.
[10578.05s -> 10583.10s]  What the fuck?
[10583.10s -> 10583.42s]  Come on.
[10587.26s -> 10589.14s]  Next game.
[10589.14s -> 10589.78s]  Hold on.
[10589.78s -> 10590.18s]  Not yet.
[10597.23s -> 10598.11s]  I wanna pick another one.
[10598.75s -> 10600.29s]  I can't believe I failed it.
[10600.93s -> 10604.03s]  I'm gonna blow through this.
[10608.78s -> 10609.90s]  See if I can catch the camera.
[10610.54s -> 10611.57s]  When does it flash?
[10616.66s -> 10617.14s]  Did I get it?
[10637.23s -> 10652.90s]  He's a reason.
[10657.09s -> 10657.81s]  Brick stare.
[10660.21s -> 10662.37s]  I'm trying to see, I guess what I'm gonna do.
[10662.37s -> 10662.69s]  Ready?
[10669.78s -> 10671.94s]  No it's, when does it take the photo?
[10671.94s -> 10675.20s]  At some point.
[10675.20s -> 10676.56s]  I gotta, I gotta do a count.
[10677.76s -> 10679.70s]  Maybe three seconds after?
[10680.42s -> 10691.28s]  All right.
[10691.28s -> 10692.40s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10692.40s -> 10693.92s]  I want to unlock the next one.
[10693.92s -> 10704.27s]  I want to unlock the next challenge at least.
[10707.14s -> 10709.47s]  I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[10710.27s -> 10711.68s]  Turns gray?
[10720.11s -> 10721.79s]  All right, it looks like right there, right?
[10722.59s -> 10723.79s]  I don't think that's correct though.
[10724.51s -> 10743.54s]  I think it is.
[10744.10s -> 10766.80s]  Oh!
[10767.84s -> 10780.29s]  Oh shit.
[10780.29s -> 10780.85s]  I'm not gonna get it.
[10781.49s -> 10787.55s]  Whatever.
[10787.63s -> 10796.64s]  I can look to see if we can get it.
[10797.36s -> 10798.32s]  Is it that flash?
[10798.32s -> 10799.20s]  I feel like, is it?
[10799.20s -> 10799.84s]  Let's find out.
[10799.84s -> 10800.64s]  Is my tongue sticking out?
[10801.76s -> 10804.67s]  No, it's not.
[10805.68s -> 10807.52s]  So it happens before the flash.
[10808.32s -> 10813.07s]  It happens at some point before the flash.
[10813.07s -> 10813.87s]  So here's what I'm gonna do.
[10814.59s -> 10815.98s]  Check this out.
[10816.94s -> 10822.80s]  See if I can get the photo
[10822.80s -> 10823.84s]  and then do the actual thing.
[10823.84s -> 10824.24s]  Here we go.
[10824.24s -> 10824.74s]  Ready?
[10847.38s -> 10848.34s]  Doesn't want me to do it.
[10854.90s -> 10863.31s]  See if I got it.
[10877.86s -> 10892.66s]  All right, it was, it's very easy.
[10893.22s -> 10904.13s]  Come on, dude, dude.
[10914.88s -> 10915.57s]  All right.
[10916.13s -> 10916.77s]  See if I got it.
[10917.41s -> 10920.35s]  This dude's a gamer.
[10920.35s -> 10920.67s]  Thank you.
[10921.31s -> 10922.64s]  Appreciate that.
[10926.40s -> 10929.76s]  Oh, it must start to take it
[10929.76s -> 10931.68s]  when the time, when the do, do, do, do, do, do
[10931.68s -> 10932.32s]  thing starts.
[10933.04s -> 10938.48s]  All right, this is it.
[10939.04s -> 10939.84s]  This is for everything.
[10939.84s -> 10940.24s]  Let's go.
[10941.12s -> 10944.80s]  And now comes the final round
[10944.80s -> 10946.48s]  of the everyday show.
[10946.48s -> 10948.24s]  We've added an additional rule
[10948.24s -> 10949.28s]  to make it harder.
[10950.48s -> 10950.64s]  Oh.
[10950.64s -> 10951.84s]  Have you ever felt lost in?
[10953.20s -> 10956.96s]  I'm on the shoes here.
[10961.62s -> 10975.18s]  It's time to face the final.
[10975.18s -> 10976.38s]  Well done.
[10976.38s -> 10979.07s]  He's strangled.
[10984.83s -> 10986.03s]  Congratulations.
[11002.80s -> 11003.30s]  Nice.
[11010.51s -> 11011.01s]  Ah.
[11043.39s -> 11072.03s]  Well done.
[11072.03s -> 11072.53s]  Try again.
[11073.95s -> 11076.51s]  You are still the winning team.
[11076.51s -> 11076.83s]  Gray?
[11076.83s -> 11077.55s]  What do you mean the gray?
[11079.06s -> 11079.94s]  The gray shadow.
[11081.79s -> 11085.38s]  I, I can't see that far away from here.
[11085.38s -> 11087.38s]  I want to, there's a 27 inch monitor
[11087.38s -> 11089.22s]  and I'm like 12 feet away.
[11089.86s -> 11093.66s]  It's the gray silhouette.
[11093.66s -> 11094.54s]  That's what it is the whole time.
[11095.10s -> 11096.42s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[11097.22s -> 11103.97s]  I want to see this one.
[11103.97s -> 11109.66s]  I'm like, okay, diaper?
[11111.01s -> 11112.53s]  I'm, I'm like, well,
[11113.09s -> 11113.73s]  you're supposed to play this
[11113.73s -> 11115.97s]  in like a fucking, in the living room.
[11115.97s -> 11117.81s]  This is like a 26 inch monitor
[11117.81s -> 11119.73s]  and I'm like fucking 15 feet away.
[11131.98s -> 11132.30s]  Shit.
[11133.02s -> 11141.50s]  Come on.
[11142.30s -> 11150.69s]  We're survival.
[11154.82s -> 11160.26s]  At least one gamer is not signed in.
[11160.26s -> 11160.76s]  Don't care.
[11161.46s -> 11167.01s]  A little vibe check.
[11167.01s -> 11167.51s]  Let's see.
[11169.08s -> 11170.60s]  In quick survival mode,
[11170.60s -> 11172.92s]  there's an unlimited number of walls.
[11182.72s -> 11185.44s]  It's time to face the horde.
[11191.49s -> 11192.93s]  Unlimited number of walls?
[11193.57s -> 11208.47s]  Oh, I've seen this already.
[11209.19s -> 11211.20s]  Congratulations.
[11214.90s -> 11218.05s]  God damn it.
[11218.93s -> 11227.51s]  Oh, it's gone.
[11227.51s -> 11227.83s]  It's gone.
[11227.83s -> 11228.33s]  It's gone.
[11229.03s -> 11243.59s]  More?
[11254.76s -> 11255.26s]  Oh, I got it.
[11255.26s -> 11255.76s]  Oh, I got it.
[11258.16s -> 11259.44s]  How many of these do in a row?
[11259.44s -> 11260.24s]  I've seen this already.
[11261.04s -> 11270.72s]  Congratulations.
[11270.72s -> 11272.79s]  How many times do I have to take a shower?
[11273.59s -> 11283.81s]  It was not even close.
[11292.13s -> 11303.14s]  It's lagging.
[11303.78s -> 11325.81s]  Did it get harder?
[11341.80s -> 11342.84s]  Am I stuck here forever
[11342.84s -> 11345.56s]  doing like the business man at the sidewalk?
[11346.52s -> 11350.16s]  How is he holding the briefcase?
[11354.32s -> 11363.27s]  All right.
[11363.27s -> 11363.83s]  Ten more of these
[11363.83s -> 11365.03s]  and if I don't see a new one, I'm stopping.
[11378.85s -> 11379.09s]  All right.
[11379.09s -> 11379.57s]  I'm done.
[11379.57s -> 11379.97s]  I'm done.
[11379.97s -> 11380.61s]  I'm done.
[11380.61s -> 11382.85s]  I think I only have unlocked one set.
[11383.49s -> 11392.80s]  I'm trapped here.
[11398.76s -> 11399.26s]  I'm done.
[11399.98s -> 11400.73s]  Get done.
[11400.73s -> 11401.29s]  I'm done.
[11401.29s -> 11402.41s]  Play until it crashes.
[11403.21s -> 11407.28s]  I lost.
[11407.82s -> 11416.47s]  I'm gonna wake up.
[11417.03s -> 11430.73s]  We got no pictures either.
[11430.73s -> 11431.23s]  All right.
[11431.69s -> 11436.57s]  Time to bring out.
[11436.57s -> 11438.33s]  Time to bring out the big guns.
[11439.21s -> 11445.10s]  Time to play You're in the Movies.
[11445.10s -> 11446.46s]  I'm gonna do like a few movies.
[11450.06s -> 11450.86s]  Where'd it go?
[11451.50s -> 11459.88s]  Time for You're in the Movies.
[11460.60s -> 11467.11s]  Actually, let me get some water.
[11467.11s -> 11468.39s]  We'll take one last break.
[11468.39s -> 11468.79s]  Oh, sorry.
[11468.79s -> 11470.15s]  I'm like bumping you.
[11470.15s -> 11471.05s]  I'm gonna be right back.
[11471.05s -> 11472.65s]  Get some water and we'll do You're in the Movies.
[11676.52s -> 11677.80s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[11677.80s -> 11680.09s]  I might have to tell you a disappointment
[11680.09s -> 11681.29s]  Andy might be coming up here.
[11682.17s -> 11683.93s]  I'd have to postpone this.
[11685.14s -> 11685.94s]  You're in the Movies.
[11686.58s -> 11688.47s]  I completely forgot.
[11688.47s -> 11689.43s]  You're in the Movies.
[11689.43s -> 11692.23s]  I had a green screen behind me last time.
[11692.23s -> 11692.73s]  Remember?
[11693.27s -> 11695.50s]  I'm not sure we're gonna get a good picture here.
[11697.27s -> 11701.40s]  I might need a green screen and some lights.
[11701.40s -> 11702.12s]  Yeah, that's...
[11702.84s -> 11703.24s]  That's...
[11703.24s -> 11703.96s]  We'll see.
[11703.96s -> 11705.56s]  We'll see if it looks all right.
[11705.56s -> 11711.06s]  Don't need that.
[11711.06s -> 11712.74s]  Oh, just...
[11712.74s -> 11714.18s]  We might.
[11717.48s -> 11718.84s]  I might not even show up.
[11719.40s -> 11734.15s]  So let's find out.
[11734.15s -> 11735.91s]  Normal people don't have green screens, though.
[11737.45s -> 11738.17s]  I mean, do...
[11738.17s -> 11738.41s]  I mean...
[11740.54s -> 11743.42s]  Do you want it to look good or do you want it to just exist?
[11743.42s -> 11745.08s]  You know what I'm saying?
[11745.08s -> 11745.40s]  It might...
[11745.40s -> 11746.36s]  It might be very bad.
[11746.36s -> 11747.32s]  We'll find out.
[11747.32s -> 11752.41s]  Normal people don't have Kinects either.
[11756.68s -> 11758.28s]  We just want it to exist.
[11765.32s -> 11765.88s]  All right.
[11765.88s -> 11766.52s]  Let's see what happens.
[11770.92s -> 11771.24s]  All right.
[11771.24s -> 11771.88s]  I don't know.
[11771.88s -> 11774.28s]  That sequel is never as good as the original.
[11774.28s -> 11775.24s]  I don't know if I like that.
[11775.24s -> 11776.12s]  I don't know if I want to do that.
[11776.92s -> 11780.94s]  How do I do this?
[11793.61s -> 11794.01s]  Hey.
[11794.01s -> 11794.17s]  No.
[11802.02s -> 11803.78s]  I fucking hate headphones so much.
[11805.14s -> 11807.86s]  When can I get the chip implanted in here so I can just go...
[11807.86s -> 11808.98s]  And there's audio.
[11808.98s -> 11809.86s]  I hate this shit.
[11809.86s -> 11813.62s]  I feel like I'm going on a goddamn scuba dive expedition when I put earphones in.
[11814.58s -> 11814.74s]  Like...
[11819.86s -> 11821.22s]  I fucking hate headphones so much.
[11822.74s -> 11834.74s]  It's not a Kinect game.
[11847.85s -> 11848.73s]  Come on.
[11848.73s -> 11855.93s]  Where is it?
[11856.82s -> 11859.14s]  Where's my Xbox vision camera?
[11860.26s -> 11876.49s]  Oh, no.
[11877.29s -> 11895.46s]  Oh, no.
[11896.18s -> 11899.54s]  No!
[11899.54s -> 11901.38s]  Where's my Xbox vision camera?
[11917.11s -> 11919.67s]  I know myself so well.
[11920.31s -> 11922.39s]  I know myself so well.
[11923.48s -> 11925.32s]  Do you know how well I know myself?
[11925.88s -> 11928.68s]  Would you like to know how well I know myself?
[11928.68s -> 11929.80s]  Let me go ahead and show you.
[11931.00s -> 11932.28s]  Xbox live vision camera.
[11932.28s -> 11934.12s]  I streamed this like two fucking years ago.
[11934.44s -> 11935.88s]  Like a year and a half ago at least, right?
[11936.90s -> 11939.94s]  I had the Xbox live vision camera.
[11939.94s -> 11941.14s]  Now, you need that peripheral.
[11941.14s -> 11943.48s]  It's an old shit peripheral.
[11943.48s -> 11950.12s]  And I somehow, in my drunken ADHD, I was like, you know what I have to fucking do?
[11950.12s -> 11951.32s]  You know what I have to fucking do?
[11951.96s -> 11956.84s]  I have to make sure that I buy two of these because I'm going to lose one.
[11966.01s -> 11969.85s]  I've got a sealed-in-the-box Xbox live vision camera.
[11972.04s -> 11973.08s]  Because I was like, you know what?
[11973.08s -> 11975.08s]  Might as well just get two because I'm a fucking idiot.
[11980.30s -> 11980.78s]  Sell it?
[11982.92s -> 11983.56s]  What?
[11983.56s -> 11988.07s]  I've had this in a box in my closet for two years.
[11988.71s -> 11992.38s]  Can I even do this right now?
[11995.83s -> 11996.47s]  All right.
[11996.47s -> 12001.24s]  But should I try to find the first?
[12001.24s -> 12008.06s]  Wait, should I try to open this first or actually sell it?
[12008.70s -> 12018.62s]  Fuck.
[12018.62s -> 12021.83s]  It's an easy $12.
[12021.83s -> 12022.15s]  No, no, no.
[12022.15s -> 12023.51s]  This is not $12, dude.
[12023.51s -> 12023.99s]  Oh my god.
[12023.99s -> 12024.47s]  I just punched you.
[12024.47s -> 12024.95s]  I'm so sorry.
[12025.91s -> 12026.63s]  They're not expensive?
[12026.63s -> 12027.59s]  Yes, they are.
[12027.59s -> 12031.62s]  You know how much an Xbox live vision camera sealed is?
[12031.62s -> 12033.86s]  Xbox live vision camera.
[12035.70s -> 12037.06s]  This shit is expensive.
[12038.58s -> 12044.10s]  It is.
[12044.10s -> 12046.26s]  I think this stuff, I think this is like $150.
[12050.84s -> 12053.16s]  Dude, it's $50 and it's only, it's only $8.
[12064.62s -> 12066.46s]  It's in the, I'm going to get a pair of scissors.
[12068.68s -> 12070.36s]  I'm going to get hurt trying to open this.
[12070.36s -> 12073.08s]  It's the old clamshell, like, get stabbed packaging.
[12078.25s -> 12078.65s]  Ow.
[12081.91s -> 12082.47s]  Hold on.
[12082.47s -> 12104.06s]  Let me get a pair of, ow, ow, ouch, ow, ow.
[12104.06s -> 12104.78s]  Stop, what?
[12110.52s -> 12113.37s]  Ow.
[12113.37s -> 12114.33s]  Okay, let me show you this.
[12114.89s -> 12116.65s]  This is like fucking glass.
[12116.65s -> 12118.09s]  Like what, what were they thinking?
[12118.73s -> 12120.09s]  What were they actually thinking?
[12120.81s -> 12127.18s]  This is like, this is fucking glass.
[12127.82s -> 12131.13s]  Look at this, it's glass.
[12131.93s -> 12138.17s]  This is like, you're going to get like, I can't.
[12138.17s -> 12139.29s]  I thought this was a fucking Kinect game.
[12139.29s -> 12139.77s]  Give me a minute.
[12140.41s -> 12234.42s]  Dude, I'm telling you right now.
[12235.54s -> 12236.98s]  How did this last for this long?
[12237.86s -> 12238.42s]  You know what I mean?
[12241.14s -> 12244.74s]  How the fuck did this last this long for this shit to be like this?
[12245.54s -> 12248.57s]  Like, if I'm a congress member or something,
[12249.21s -> 12251.13s]  the first time I open a package like this,
[12251.13s -> 12254.01s]  the next day I'm being like, this shit's fucking illegal now.
[12261.05s -> 12263.85s]  This clamshell package, this is fucking insane.
[12265.05s -> 12267.29s]  Like, what the fuck were they thinking?
[12268.33s -> 12271.27s]  They're out of their minds.
[12274.18s -> 12275.22s]  And I've got tools here.
[12275.22s -> 12276.82s]  I've got like a fucking tool here.
[12277.62s -> 12291.74s]  I would have, I would have put a bill on the table.
[12292.78s -> 12296.46s]  That was, you put something in clamshell packaging.
[12297.10s -> 12301.06s]  The company has fined 500 fucking quadrillion dollars.
[12301.78s -> 12303.29s]  Ain't ever going to do it again.
[12306.09s -> 12306.97s]  Ah, that could have hurt me.
[12307.61s -> 12312.18s]  All right, I'm in.
[12320.26s -> 12321.14s]  Merry Christmas!
[12321.94s -> 12334.63s]  Why's there a headset?
[12334.63s -> 12337.74s]  Why's there a headset in here?
[12337.74s -> 12351.38s]  Put it on.
[12352.02s -> 12352.58s]  Let's start.
[12353.70s -> 12355.30s]  I have to plug in the camera for this.
[12355.30s -> 12357.94s]  Wait, oh no, this ain't going to fucking work.
[12357.94s -> 12360.58s]  Because I need to like, this, look at this little stand.
[12360.58s -> 12361.94s]  This ain't going to fit anywhere.
[12363.06s -> 12364.26s]  This is, this ain't going to happen.
[12365.22s -> 12368.65s]  I don't, I, wait, can I put, I think I can put it on top of the Kinect.
[12369.37s -> 12374.07s]  Let me see if I can get it on top of the Kinect.
[12374.07s -> 12379.06s]  It's the last time I actually taped it to the top of my monitor.
[12379.06s -> 12381.14s]  See if I can get it to stand on the Kinect.
[12403.93s -> 12404.33s]  We're good.
[12405.13s -> 12405.77s]  We're good, it's on.
[12406.41s -> 12406.89s]  Plug it in.
[12407.45s -> 12410.66s]  All right, hold on, the VRB.
[12411.38s -> 12415.03s]  It's peering on top of there.
[12415.59s -> 12435.34s]  Work!
[12435.34s -> 12446.68s]  Looks like it's on.
[12446.68s -> 12457.86s]  Holy shit, this looks horrible.
[12474.86s -> 12486.65s]  It's like, yeah, it's like 10p.
[12486.65s -> 12487.29s]  Wipe it off?
[12488.17s -> 12491.05s]  Is it dead pixels on this thing?
[12491.77s -> 12501.75s]  They're dead pixels.
[12501.75s -> 12502.79s]  All right, hold on.
[12502.79s -> 12503.51s]  Movie theater.
[12504.23s -> 12504.87s]  Make a movie.
[12511.96s -> 12512.52s]  Oh no!
[12517.64s -> 12519.24s]  Fuck, did the save?
[12519.24s -> 12520.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
[12521.32s -> 12522.04s]  I'm on David.
[12522.68s -> 12523.77s]  I'm on David.
[12527.13s -> 12528.17s]  No, it's not in focus.
[12536.60s -> 12552.34s]  There's a dead pixel.
[12552.34s -> 12553.70s]  There's like five dead pixels.
[12565.78s -> 12566.02s]  Yes!
[12595.45s -> 12601.21s]  Need a green screen!
[12609.85s -> 12611.93s]  Are you sure you want it to exist?
[12613.05s -> 12614.25s]  You positive?
[12614.25s -> 12615.37s]  You can't even see me.
[12623.48s -> 12625.48s]  No, no, it's got to be better than that.
[12625.48s -> 12626.36s]  It's got to be better.
[12626.36s -> 12627.56s]  I'm candidate.
[12628.12s -> 12628.76s]  I'm candidate.
[12628.76s -> 12630.04s]  We're going to do this again another day.
[12631.80s -> 12632.68s]  Take your shirt off.
[12633.16s -> 12634.28s]  That actually probably would help.
[12635.00s -> 12636.33s]  What did?
[12636.89s -> 12640.95s]  Oh, what am I doing?
[12640.95s -> 12642.07s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[12642.07s -> 12644.49s]  Your audio?
[12650.18s -> 12651.46s]  It's like eating my whole face.
[12660.01s -> 12661.05s]  No, this ain't going to work.
[12661.61s -> 12663.32s]  It ain't going to work.
[12663.32s -> 12665.16s]  I'm going to set this up so we can do it for real.
[12674.60s -> 12676.12s]  It does work.
[12676.92s -> 12678.92s]  Holy shit, there's a line.
[12678.92s -> 12679.80s]  Put a blanket up.
[12681.27s -> 12683.27s]  I put a blanket up?
[12683.27s -> 12685.19s]  It's going to take like fucking 30 minutes
[12685.19s -> 12686.55s]  for me to get a blanket and put it up.
[12686.55s -> 12688.07s]  I don't have a blanket that can go up there.
[12688.87s -> 12690.84s]  Press RB.
[12690.84s -> 12692.36s]  I've been going to different color styles.
[12694.20s -> 12695.48s]  I'm going to call it here.
[12695.48s -> 12696.44s]  I want to get this ready.
[12697.24s -> 12704.86s]  That just made me depressed.
[12705.42s -> 12720.57s]  I'm looking.
[12720.57s -> 12722.01s]  I thought this was a Kinect game.
[12724.34s -> 12724.66s]  Well, wait.
[12724.66s -> 12724.98s]  Hold on.
[12724.98s -> 12725.54s]  Hold on a minute.
[12726.26s -> 12729.82s]  Oh, this one sucks.
[12730.46s -> 12734.65s]  You see yourself clearly in the background.
[12734.65s -> 12734.89s]  No.
[12774.26s -> 12775.06s]  Better shirt on?
[12775.06s -> 12775.46s]  Hold on.
[12776.10s -> 12829.08s]  Oh, son.
[12829.32s -> 12830.68s]  You forgot to turn your screen off.
[12833.82s -> 12835.74s]  You got to turn off this fucking Xbox again.
[12836.38s -> 12840.86s]  It's the shelf.
[12841.82s -> 12843.42s]  It's not going to be possible to have a screen.
[12846.78s -> 12847.10s]  All right.
[12853.16s -> 12853.88s]  Move the shelf.
[12854.44s -> 12854.84s]  Camera.
[12854.84s -> 12856.68s]  I got very much room.
[12856.68s -> 12857.40s]  Remove the shelf.
[12857.40s -> 12858.76s]  I can't just move a shelf.
[12858.76s -> 12860.68s]  There's a shitload of stuff on here.
[12860.68s -> 12861.56s]  I'll knock it over.
[12864.04s -> 12864.36s]  All right.
[12865.24s -> 12866.04s]  I'm going to res...
[12866.04s -> 12866.36s]  All right.
[12866.36s -> 12866.76s]  That's it.
[12866.76s -> 12867.56s]  I'll see you guys later.
[12868.36s -> 12869.24s]  I'll see you guys later.
[12869.24s -> 12869.64s]  We tried.
[12877.24s -> 12879.02s]  But very important.
[12891.74s -> 12892.46s]  God damn it.
[12892.46s -> 12893.90s]  It's close, but it's not going to work.
[12901.77s -> 12914.15s]  All right.
[12914.95s -> 12915.59s]  I'll see you guys later.
[12915.59s -> 12915.91s]  I'm done.
[12918.34s -> 12918.98s]  That was fun.
[12920.50s -> 12921.14s]  It's fun.
[12928.63s -> 12931.91s]  I fucking drained all my batteries doing the UFC fight thing.
[12932.55s -> 12935.34s]  I'll be live tomorrow.
[12935.34s -> 12936.06s]  We'll do it tomorrow.
[12936.78s -> 12939.02s]  Let me try to get it actually set up so we can do it tomorrow.
[12946.82s -> 12947.78s]  Family Guy music.
[12949.00s -> 12949.24s]  All right.
[12949.24s -> 12951.40s]  So I'm going to try to get this set up for tomorrow.
[12951.40s -> 12956.78s]  If I don't like the way it looks, just keep an eye on the sus.
[12957.34s -> 12959.26s]  Because if I can't get this the way that I want it,
[12959.26s -> 12961.26s]  then we'll do it again later with a proper screen.
[12963.80s -> 12966.52s]  If not, then I'll be back in a couple of days.
[12966.52s -> 12966.84s]  Okay.
[12967.40s -> 12967.96s]  I'm going to try.
[12968.68s -> 12970.46s]  Keep an eye on the sus.
[12970.46s -> 12971.42s]  It's to be determined.
[12971.42s -> 12972.06s]  I'm going to...
[12972.06s -> 12973.10s]  Tomorrow I'm going to get up early.
[12973.74s -> 12975.11s]  Maybe I can get this to work.
[12975.75s -> 12978.95s]  That was a lot of fun though.
[12978.95s -> 12981.77s]  It sucks.
[12981.77s -> 12982.97s]  What a fucking waste of...
[12983.53s -> 12984.97s]  What a waste of waxling.
[12985.61s -> 12985.85s]  No.
[12985.85s -> 12986.65s]  Should I be that harsh?
[12987.29s -> 12991.32s]  I don't know if I should be that harsh.
[12992.04s -> 13000.57s]  And I fucking sucked laughing my ass off.
[13001.37s -> 13002.30s]  Yeah.
[13002.30s -> 13002.54s]  All right.
[13002.54s -> 13004.86s]  If it's not this tomorrow, then I will see you on.
[13005.74s -> 13007.26s]  And I'll be very...
[13007.26s -> 13008.86s]  You'll just keep an eye on the sus.
[13008.86s -> 13016.49s]  If there's no stream tomorrow, then we will be live on the...
[13017.29s -> 13019.37s]  All right.
[13019.37s -> 13020.17s]  The sixth...
[13020.17s -> 13021.37s]  I got to plan this out here because it's...
[13023.66s -> 13027.74s]  The next stream is actually to be determined because the sixth is a big stream.
[13028.89s -> 13030.41s]  And I got to make sure that's ready to go.
[13030.41s -> 13031.13s]  So let's...
[13032.01s -> 13033.61s]  There'll be another stream in the next few days.
[13035.24s -> 13038.60s]  If you don't know, there's going to be a major stream on the sixth.
[13039.40s -> 13040.70s]  You'll see what it is.
[13041.69s -> 13042.89s]  Wonders of Archaeology.
[13045.35s -> 13046.39s]  I just need to figure out...
[13047.11s -> 13051.03s]  Because there's production shit that's going to be happening over the next four or five days.
[13051.75s -> 13053.67s]  And I kind of need to know exactly what's going on.
[13053.67s -> 13055.43s]  So you'll see that.
[13055.43s -> 13057.67s]  I will just keep an eye on the sus over the next day or two.
[13057.67s -> 13059.59s]  I don't really know exactly when the next stream will be,
[13059.59s -> 13061.03s]  but it will be within the next few days.
[13063.24s -> 13064.20s]  To be determined.
[13066.58s -> 13068.50s]  I will see you guys to be determined.
[13069.22s -> 13073.50s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[13073.50s -> 13076.60s]  I got to turn off this Family Guy music.
[13076.60s -> 13078.60s]  We'll see you guys within the next few days.
[13078.60s -> 13079.48s]  I'll see you soon.
[13079.48s -> 13084.44s]  I just want to make sure I get this right.
[13084.44s -> 13086.28s]  That same monkey eating the bananas.
[13091.37s -> 13092.81s]  Thanks, as always, for watching, everybody.
[13093.53s -> 13096.41s]  I'm going to go take a shower or a bath or either or.
[13096.41s -> 13101.38s]  And I think the Kinect is going to get punted as far as I can get it.
[13101.94s -> 13105.10s]  We're stream heart.
[13105.10s -> 13106.54s]  I don't believe that's accurate.
[13108.87s -> 13109.99s]  I don't think that's accurate.
[13109.99s -> 13110.31s]  I don't.
[13110.31s -> 13112.01s]  I don't think that's accurate.
[13112.01s -> 13113.37s]  I had a lot of fun on this stream.
[13113.37s -> 13114.09s]  Usually I can tell.
[13125.94s -> 13126.82s]  And that guy.
[13126.82s -> 13127.38s]  No, you can't.
[13127.38s -> 13131.06s]  You're not going to get banned if having an opinion on whether a stream was good or not.
[13131.06s -> 13133.96s]  I mean, I'll call you a fucking dick.
[13133.96s -> 13143.74s]  You're not going to get banned.
[13143.74s -> 13144.30s]  All right.
[13144.30s -> 13146.70s]  Let us hold on a second here.
[13146.70s -> 13160.12s]  You're right.
[13160.12s -> 13164.20s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[13164.20s -> 13173.80s]  Styr is RPing right now.
[13173.80s -> 13174.68s]  Oh, my God.
[13174.68s -> 13177.30s]  Are you serious?
[13177.30s -> 13177.54s]  All right.
[13177.54s -> 13178.66s]  I'm going to let's write Styr.
[13179.80s -> 13183.64s]  I'm very curious because I let's see how how GTA RP is.
[13185.02s -> 13185.58s]  All right.
[13185.58s -> 13187.02s]  Styr is RPing right now.
[13187.02s -> 13190.38s]  OK, so like he's not going to sing you a raid song.
[13190.38s -> 13193.46s]  He's like in the middle of RPing.
[13193.46s -> 13201.72s]  So let him RP if he's in the middle of like a routine or something.
[13201.72s -> 13202.92s]  I just it's all good.
[13202.92s -> 13208.42s]  You see, let's see how he does be nice.
[13208.42s -> 13210.66s]  I will see you guys in the next few days.
[13211.38s -> 13213.88s]  Take care of yourselves.
[13213.88s -> 13366.86s]  See you soon and good night.
