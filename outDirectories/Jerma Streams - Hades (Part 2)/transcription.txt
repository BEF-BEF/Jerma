[1.02s -> 12.22s]  Hi, welcome everyone. How are you? Welcome to another day playing video games and streaming it.
[12.86s -> 24.86s]  A little early today, yeah. Well, technically early. I did say I wanted to start around 1 or 2.
[25.50s -> 33.06s]  It's like 1.30, 1.40, somewhere in the middle there. You just started going to the bathroom.
[35.98s -> 45.70s]  Thanks for telling us. Hey, speaking of the bathroom, uh, I didn't even tell pre-stream chat
[45.70s -> 59.26s]  this because I was waiting. I dropped my phone in the toilet when it was very dark at night.
[62.02s -> 69.22s]  This was way worse than the April Fool's video. And it sucks because I got a new phone. But it's
[69.22s -> 76.41s]  fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Let me explain. So, you know when you get up to go
[76.41s -> 80.41s]  to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Or if you wake up really early and it's still...
[80.41s -> 84.68s]  How many guys have woken up? I have to go pee in the middle of the night. Sometimes, right?
[85.32s -> 92.28s]  It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes it does. Like, you drink like a shitload of water
[92.28s -> 94.84s]  before you go to bed and you're like, oh wow, I shouldn't have done that. I know I'm gonna have
[94.84s -> 103.13s]  to go pee later. Anyways, I had to go pee and it's like, it's pitch black. There's no real...
[103.13s -> 111.34s]  There's a little light in my bedroom. That's it. So, I did what every normal, sane human does.
[111.90s -> 120.73s]  I grabbed my phone and I used the light on the phone to go to the bathroom because I don't want
[120.73s -> 129.48s]  a big bright light in my face. Ah, my eyes! So, you might be misconstruing what I'm talking about
[129.48s -> 136.23s]  here. I'm not talking about the flashlight on the phone. I'm talking about the home screen.
[138.54s -> 144.06s]  Like, the home screen is bright, is horrible. So, I'm aiming the home... I go into the bathroom
[144.62s -> 152.38s]  and I'm aiming the home screen into the toilet bowl so I can pee into the toilet. So, I can see
[152.38s -> 160.46s]  and it's not bright enough where it's gonna hurt me. And like most people, I have my home screen
[161.26s -> 167.40s]  to just auto turn off after like 10 seconds of being on. So, you get to this weird, like,
[168.20s -> 172.36s]  goose chase where you've pulled your home screen down to go to the bathroom
[173.16s -> 177.24s]  and it turns off and it's pitch black again. You're like, oh shit, I gotta fight. Turn it back on.
[178.22s -> 186.30s]  Well, while I was holding it down with the home screen, I remember I'm mid-piss. I'm peeing
[186.30s -> 191.32s]  it's mid-piss. It's like a 20 to 30 second full piss. 10 seconds into the full piss.
[192.82s -> 196.74s]  I drop it right, right, and I'm pissing on the phone. I'm pissing on the phone and it's in piss
[196.74s -> 203.86s]  water into the toilet, peeing on it. And I can't stop pissing. I can't stop it. You cannot turn it
[203.86s -> 211.88s]  off. So, I am just pissing all over my new iPhone and I just, I've reached into the toilet and I
[211.88s -> 217.08s]  pulled it out and I was like, oh shit, no, no, no, no, no, no. But I still have to pee. So, I'm sitting
[217.08s -> 222.86s]  there holding, I'm peeing into the toilet and I'm holding this pee phone and I don't know what,
[222.86s -> 231.56s]  I didn't know what to do. So finally, like, I finish peeing and then I scramble to, I put the
[231.56s -> 236.68s]  phone down on the little, on the sink and I'm like, I was like, I was running around, I was like a
[236.68s -> 241.40s]  Scooby-Doo chase. I didn't know what to do. I'm like running from room to room. Should I use a
[241.40s -> 245.56s]  towel? No, that's disgusting. Should I, paper towels? Oh, do I put it on ice? Do I put it on
[245.56s -> 249.88s]  rice? Oh, so I just started wiping it down. I got paper towels, got it. It was dry, right? Completely
[249.88s -> 256.36s]  dry. Took it out of the case. Dry, dry, dry, dry, dry. I looked into the inside of the little,
[256.36s -> 261.29s]  the hole where you plug in the lightning thing. It's an iPhone. And that was dry too. And I was
[261.29s -> 269.50s]  fine. There's no damage to the phone at all. Zero. And I mean absolutely zero. Yes, I washed. Yes,
[269.50s -> 276.79s]  I washed it. Of course I did. So, let me just tell you that the, the new iPhones apparently
[277.43s -> 284.25s]  can be pissed on and dropped in your toilet for at least three to four seconds. I am not
[284.25s -> 289.99s]  kidding. This act, this is, this is a real fucking story. This happened. There's nothing wrong with
[289.99s -> 298.49s]  this phone. It is perfectly fine. Yes, I have pissed on my phone for more than a few seconds.
[299.13s -> 315.05s]  They are waterproof. No, they're not. It works for now. No, it, it works. There's nothing wrong with
[315.05s -> 320.92s]  it. Guys, I've had water damage on my phones before and you get that weird gray line of the
[320.92s -> 326.20s]  gray spots that just take over and they just sit there forever. No, this thing is completely fine.
[326.84s -> 333.16s]  What does it smell like? Guys, I didn't like, I didn't drop it in the toilet and piss on it and
[333.16s -> 339.03s]  then like take it out and dry it and put it in my pocket. I washed this phone. I scrubbed it. I
[339.03s -> 345.48s]  wouldn't, I scrubbed it with soap. I kind of did scrub it with soap and water. I like, I like washed
[345.48s -> 356.50s]  my hands with my phone in my hands. It still works. I didn't, no, that's not completely accurate.
[357.58s -> 362.86s]  I like did enough water where I could like on top of the phone with a little soap and like alcohol
[362.86s -> 369.86s]  and I didn't, I'm kidding. But I am not kidding when I say that this one, that this one could plunk
[370.42s -> 375.30s]  underwater and pissed on for at least three to four seconds. And it does nothing wrong with it.
[375.30s -> 382.20s]  It's fine. None of that is embellished and none of it's made up at all. That is a 100% true story.
[384.04s -> 393.16s]  Show the phone, show the toilet. You need to bleach it. I've, I alcohol,
[393.96s -> 399.54s]  but isopropyl alcohol is not good enough. Isopropyl alcohol, it kills everything.
[404.49s -> 409.58s]  Show your microwave. Microwave.
[410.14s -> 426.86s]  Piss on it again. It's still one percent. Yeah, you know, there might be,
[427.88s -> 432.04s]  it might be 1% piss somewhere in this phone. I don't know. It's probably dried up by now.
[434.39s -> 437.99s]  Piss in your microwave. All right, we're going to move on. So I had to tell you that story because,
[437.99s -> 440.79s]  you know, you guys like, oh, I didn't even tweet this stream out. What the?
[441.59s -> 448.50s]  I'll play in Hades again tonight. I really like it. It's really fun.
[449.22s -> 458.06s]  And I'm going to see how far I get, see if I can beat it. Tweet out the pee story.
[460.63s -> 465.75s]  No, I don't tweet. I do tweet. I tweet, but then I hit go to drafts because I don't care.
[466.47s -> 473.34s]  So I tweet to myself every time I have a tweet that I'm like, you know what? Here we go. I'm
[473.34s -> 477.74s]  going to make a tweet. Save to drafts. Yeah, that's a good one. I don't care though. I don't want to
[477.74s -> 486.76s]  have nobody to see that. All right. Let me, let me prove to you. Let me, okay. I'm going to read
[486.76s -> 494.26s]  you one of my drafts. Uh, and then sometimes the tweets that I come up with, I just say at a stream
[494.26s -> 500.42s]  the next day, for instance, holy shit. Parents sit your kids in front of Sesame street. Do not
[500.42s -> 504.34s]  let them touch the fucking bath salt kids channels where they narrate over the Sims pretending to
[504.34s -> 513.99s]  talk while eating red, green and blue foods every day. That's a draft from like probably four days
[513.99s -> 521.24s]  ago. Uh, after that, uh, you can probably determine where these tweets came from. Uh, if I hear the
[521.24s -> 526.68s]  words democratic stronghold one more time, I'm going to eat glass. You could probably dictate
[526.76s -> 535.38s]  where that's from, what, what time period that's from. LOL. Why is Mortal Kombat 11 turning into
[535.38s -> 540.58s]  eighties movie smash brothers? That was a good one. You've heard me say that. Oh, here's a good
[540.58s -> 545.54s]  one. A sneeze coming on with a mouthful of food is the yellow traffic light of eating.
[547.45s -> 556.82s]  Like that one. Didn't send it out though. Oh, here's one. Serving sizes always make me laugh
[556.82s -> 562.82s]  about three cookies, 12 chips, et cetera. Why don't they be realistic? Eat out of this bag until your
[562.82s -> 579.93s]  stomach hurts. There's more. Tweet all these out. Do you tweet? No, those are, those are tweets for
[579.93s -> 587.66s]  me. Those are my tweets. Those are my, those are tweets for me. That's pretty good. Stand up. Yeah.
[587.66s -> 592.62s]  My drafts are just me writing down like future jokes that I'm going to make on stream.
[595.64s -> 604.54s]  It's just a notepad for me. Release the drafts. Like I can't look, I, I, you don't think this
[604.54s -> 607.18s]  scenario where I'd be like, let me tell you something about eating when you have sneeze
[607.18s -> 611.50s]  coming on. Let me tell you. It's, every time you have a sneeze coming on and you have a mouthful
[611.50s -> 616.22s]  of food, you got to make a choice. You either eat, eat, eat, eat, eat quick before you sneeze,
[616.22s -> 620.70s]  or you hold on tight and you'd wait for it to pass and try not to sneeze the food all over yourself.
[621.26s -> 628.38s]  It's, it would have been pretty good. Sneeze the food out. What do you do?
[629.18s -> 633.50s]  No, I'm serious. What do you do? If you have to sneeze after you take a bite of a sandwich,
[634.06s -> 638.54s]  do you spit the sandwich out? Do you sneeze the food out? Do you swallow quick before it happens?
[639.42s -> 646.30s]  It's tough. You hold, you hold your nose. You hold on. You sneeze it out. I, I'll tell you,
[646.30s -> 653.30s]  I usually try to swallow it as fast as I can. Well, it depends. And just like a yellow traffic
[653.30s -> 660.58s]  light. Where are you? Have you chewed four or five times? Did you just take the bite? What happened?
[661.74s -> 666.92s]  How far, how close are you to swallowing it? That's virally important for you to know.
[668.62s -> 677.34s]  I close my eyes. You cover your mouth and just like sneeze the food into your hand.
[682.52s -> 690.60s]  It sucks. It's a horrible scenario. Sneeze in your mouth and eat the boogers plus the sandwich.
[690.60s -> 693.56s]  Okay. Why did I, of all the ones that people were saying, why did I read that one?
[697.11s -> 701.66s]  You guys are disgusting. You guys are disgusting. Where do you get it from?
[702.65s -> 708.57s]  I just went on like a five minute talk about how I pissed on my phone in the, in the bathroom.
[708.57s -> 712.95s]  Where do you guys get this from? You're ridiculous. You guys need to settle down.
[716.01s -> 720.65s]  All right. Let's, uh, we're gonna play Hades. I'm into it. I love it. It's a 92 right now.
[720.65s -> 732.87s]  We'll see where it ends up at the end of the stream. We'll see. This is a contender for
[732.87s -> 737.72s]  nastiest stream. There's no category for nastiest stream. It's obviously $50.
[741.21s -> 749.11s]  Zurich Doug gave 5,000 bits. Gave it a lot of money recently. Thanks for the 50 bucks. 50, 50,
[749.11s -> 755.10s]  five zero. My favorite streamer playing one of my favorite games. I can't watch the whole stream
[755.10s -> 767.13s]  live, but I hope you enjoy yourself. I love it. Hades fucking sucks. Um, I, I, uh, I, look,
[767.77s -> 775.69s]  you need to relax. Okay. Let me get back in this. Let me, how many would I have? Two, three. Should
[775.69s -> 787.70s]  we ban people for their opinions that I don't like? I don't like doing that though. Oh, audio. Yeah.
[787.70s -> 790.66s]  No, I don't like doing that. If somebody has opinion that I think I don't like, what do you
[790.66s -> 795.48s]  want me to say? You're not allowed, you're no longer allowed to hang out here. Get out of here.
[797.37s -> 802.17s]  No, I'm going to publicly ridicule, ridicule me instead. I just fucked up the word ridicule. All
[802.17s -> 810.49s]  right. I want, I want money. If you don't know what Hades is, it's a rogue like shooter action
[810.49s -> 823.37s]  RPG, top down strategy game. All right. I'm good. I remember the deal with the traps. Oh, no, no,
[823.37s -> 832.95s]  no. I may, I made sure to play over that. I want money. You just, you just tubered yourself.
[833.59s -> 841.14s]  How does one tuber themself? I forget what I don't know. What am I? Oh yeah. I'm doing the
[841.14s -> 853.50s]  ice mode. I'm doing ice guy ice guy. Right. Come on. I get that right. I was my quote medical
[853.50s -> 857.18s]  appointment. Oh, let's talk about that really quickly. Okay. This would be the probably the
[857.18s -> 860.86s]  last time I talk about medical stuff unless something major comes up, but here you go.
[860.86s -> 868.14s]  Here's what has been concluded over various doctors, medical professionals, medical personnel.
[868.14s -> 873.96s]  I have two discs in my spine that are black. They're dark. And that means that they're
[873.96s -> 882.54s]  degenerating. So I have essentially the onset of some disc degeneration and it's mild enough
[882.54s -> 888.20s]  for it's manageable. It's not going to, it's not a bad thing. It's actually good to know.
[888.20s -> 894.04s]  And the muscle tissue around my spine is not having a good time. On top of that,
[894.04s -> 901.21s]  I also have a hiatal hernia, which may have been causing this kind of chest problems. So I,
[901.21s -> 906.95s]  the doctors think I'm getting combo'd essentially where I might have, it's the couple of discs in
[906.95s -> 913.51s]  my back that are kind of slowly degenerating and this little hernia that's in my chest and the
[913.51s -> 918.31s]  muscle tissue and the fiber are kind of fucked up around the spine. So I might have like three
[918.31s -> 923.66s]  different like combo attack on me. So what we're going to do is over the next few weeks, I'm going
[923.66s -> 930.06s]  to be getting trigger point injections, which is they go into the painful points of my back and
[930.06s -> 940.23s]  spine area and they try to shut it up. So that's step one. If that helps, if that really goes away
[940.23s -> 949.46s]  and it really has a huge effect on my, you know, my physical ability, then I'll be good. If it
[949.46s -> 958.34s]  doesn't, and let's say my back pain goes away or it's easier to live with, but my chest problem is
[958.34s -> 965.77s]  still there, then I'm probably going to elect to do a hiatal hernia surgery repair. I'm just going
[965.77s -> 971.88s]  to essentially, I'm going to shotgun blast this and try everything that's possible. But there's
[971.88s -> 977.40s]  your kind of definitive things that people have come up with. There are two or three, the third
[977.40s -> 984.02s]  disc in that area. It's in, it's right in that spot where it hurts too. So I have two shitty discs,
[984.02s -> 989.59s]  but they're not shitty enough to cause any, it's like, it's not shitty enough to do surgery on.
[989.59s -> 995.00s]  It's not like, oh wow, look at how horrible these are. We're going to do spine surgery now.
[995.00s -> 1001.30s]  It's not there. I just kind of have to do pain management to it because you can't fix it. It
[1001.30s -> 1009.00s]  really never goes away. I can just get a sort of injections and, you know, the theory was a few
[1009.00s -> 1013.66s]  months ago, three or four or five months ago that I would do like an intercostal nerve block just to
[1013.66s -> 1018.79s]  like shut the pain receptors off because my pain receptors might be going crazy too. So I don't
[1018.79s -> 1026.30s]  know. We're going to go for it. That was his last break dance. Hey, you don't know that yet. You
[1026.30s -> 1040.18s]  don't know that yet, but that's sort of where we are now. I appreciate all the, everyone obviously
[1040.90s -> 1047.21s]  has been concerned about it. I have been too, but the good thing is almost every single
[1047.21s -> 1054.36s]  possible thing that could be very major wrong is not wrong. There are a couple of small things
[1054.36s -> 1059.80s]  that I still need to keep my eye on over the years. And one of them is I have a prostate problem too,
[1060.52s -> 1064.28s]  but that's not causing this problem. That's sort of just incidentally, it was like, hey,
[1065.32s -> 1071.80s]  you kind of have like a prostate problem, dude. So I do. Yeah. Oh, let's keep an eye on that.
[1073.37s -> 1079.93s]  Oh, but remember, I have, I have done like, I've probably done like, I've been to the doctor like
[1079.93s -> 1087.19s]  30 times over the last like six to seven months, realistically, right? So it's like,
[1087.19s -> 1097.42s]  they're going to incidentally find something. That's a new enemy. Not doing enough zirking off.
[1098.14s -> 1104.78s]  Okay. Can I even say that? Can I even say what I just said? Am I, is this allowed to talk about
[1104.78s -> 1126.74s]  that? It's off. Why is it off? Oh, shit. I can't do it. Oh, these guys, these guys here. Here we go.
[1126.74s -> 1143.29s]  Oops. Oops. Oh, it bounces around. Right, right, right, right, right. Hi. I donated $15. I demand
[1143.29s -> 1152.47s]  a face cam. What? No, no face cam. Guys, don't you have, have you figured, has anybody figured
[1152.47s -> 1160.39s]  this out yet? I only do face cams when I like feel handsome. When I go, I look in the mirror
[1160.39s -> 1171.62s]  and I'm like, oh, I got, ooh, look at this guy today. Let's go. Face cam. You know, most of the
[1171.62s -> 1178.10s]  time I look at the mirror and it's like, ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We don't need to see that
[1178.10s -> 1185.83s]  today. And plus that's a good excuse because I'm, I'm naked. I don't have a shirt on. I'm bare,
[1185.91s -> 1192.36s]  bare chest right now. You should always feel handsome. No, I don't. Look, I have confidence.
[1192.36s -> 1218.38s]  I do. Uh, I think I want Hermes. Oh, couple cats. Why are they cats? Show your prostate.
[1219.02s -> 1231.62s]  Hey, take a look guys. Like, like an X-ray, like a MRI of my prostate. Why would you want to see
[1231.62s -> 1237.00s]  that? Oh, I forgot about my skeleton photo. I have to get a, I have to get a copy of that.
[1237.64s -> 1249.03s]  It is. Ooh, attack speed or movement speed? Probably attack speed, right?
[1254.47s -> 1266.50s]  I would say one. How much faster is 10%? I mean, it's not making the charge faster though. That's
[1266.50s -> 1275.34s]  what I care about, but I can still, it's still cool. That's your special, not attack. Is it?
[1277.64s -> 1290.95s]  Huh. Hermes sans reveal. Uh, another $50 comes in from Zurich. That's a hundred bucks on the,
[1290.95s -> 1296.15s]  in the 30 minutes, the 20 minutes I've been streaming. Also, I won some money so I can shout
[1296.15s -> 1306.39s]  our handsome streamer, Jerma's special meal from Maccas. Maccas. McDonald's? You won some money.
[1306.39s -> 1319.59s]  Well, I hope, I hope you got a lot. That's a, oh, that's a restaurant in Australia.
[1320.76s -> 1338.62s]  Maccas? Oh, it's not McDonald's? It is. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. All right. You cast,
[1338.62s -> 1345.11s]  all right. Any effects are more potent. I cast right now is the, isn't it the lightning beam
[1345.11s -> 1350.98s]  thing? The cast fires longer and inflicts chill. Actually that's probably, that's probably much
[1350.98s -> 1360.74s]  better. I like this too though. I'm getting a casting. I haven't even done it. McDonald's
[1360.74s -> 1385.45s]  officially changed its name to Maccas in Australia. Why? What? Maccas? The cast is unbelievable,
[1385.45s -> 1403.43s]  by the way. Who's shooting all this? Oh, it's these dickheads. What? Oh, it's cause the thing,
[1403.43s -> 1408.38s]  all right, the thing he's shooting is blue. It's like, wait, what is happening? What is the
[1408.38s -> 1429.16s]  little blue shit shooting from the sides? Oh, that's Poseidon doing that. Dick. Hey, JPQ plays.
[1429.16s -> 1435.58s]  Thanks for the five community subs. You deal more damage when slamming foes into barriers.
[1437.66s -> 1447.14s]  Call polls in foes and effect, holy shit, that's much better. You poll people in? All right,
[1447.14s -> 1455.58s]  that's really good. I don't want to sell anything. I want to buy things. Poseidon's literally the
[1455.58s -> 1466.54s]  biggest asshole in all of Olympus. I don't know much of the lore. Ooh, all right, I got 294.
[1467.18s -> 1481.00s]  That's enough for Dionysius, Travis Scott meal, and can I get them all? Oh, a bunch of you guys
[1481.00s -> 1486.18s]  weren't here yesterday. That's like, that's just what we call this. No, no, that's just what we
[1486.18s -> 1489.94s]  call this. Okay, those of you guys that weren't here yesterday, that's just what we've been
[1489.94s -> 1498.33s]  calling that. That's not like, oh, I'm making like a joke today. No, this is what we call that meal.
[1500.23s -> 1510.07s]  Oh shit, it's okay. It's a, this is a boss fight. I need to heal. I need, I have to heal and extra
[1510.07s -> 1527.48s]  health or heal and Dionysius. Maybe I'll do the heart. Yeah. All right, let's kick some ass.
[1528.12s -> 1538.82s]  I remember this fight being very difficult. Run is literally over. It might be. These guys are hard.
[1539.46s -> 1540.66s]  This, these guys are crazy.
[1556.01s -> 1558.49s]  Even though I was outnumbered. Take the wrestling belt.
[1564.10s -> 1568.58s]  How was your date last night? I went to, I didn't go to, I was out of medical
[1568.58s -> 1579.59s]  professional's office. That's not a date. That's the sound it makes? One, two, three, action.
[1580.15s -> 1617.61s]  What the fuck did you just say? Whoa, I forgot. He ain't got shit. Well, these guys have a lot of
[1617.61s -> 1663.54s]  health. I forgot. It's time for father's call. He's blocking it. Oh shit. I stood still. What
[1663.54s -> 1677.35s]  happened? Oh, this is when Aphrodite comes in. Run into something already. Oh, that hurt. Father's
[1677.35s -> 1737.59s]  blessing. I thought there was an enemy. Shit. Get in there. No. Way to go. Father's call.
[1738.15s -> 1805.06s]  What? Oops. Father's call. Run into something. All right, let's go. Way to go. Oh, that's a lot
[1805.06s -> 1835.93s]  longer than I thought it was. Charge. Oh, he's getting close. Okay, we're good. Run into
[1835.93s -> 1843.94s]  something, please. We're good. Good thing I had that father's call. It's your uncle. It's your,
[1843.94s -> 1856.33s]  well, whatever. I'm just like every character in Marvel versus Capcom. I'm just doing all kinds of
[1856.33s -> 1865.98s]  moves and then when I do my special, I just say the thing that it is. That's a Marvel versus
[1865.98s -> 1875.61s]  Capcom reference. That ain't nothing to do with those other four games. Oh, go to the fan. Yeah.
[1875.61s -> 1887.88s]  Hi. Look, it's a fan. How come I only have one fan if I've done this twice? Don't they know
[1887.88s -> 1901.24s]  already? Does the agreement carry over? Yeah, because I haven't paid up yet. 145. Oh, that's
[1901.24s -> 1908.82s]  right. I get full healed from all the fountains now. I forgot about that. That's not a fan.
[1909.46s -> 1922.71s]  What would you call it? Give me it. What do I get? What do I get? Perhaps deal 500% damage to foes.
[1926.52s -> 1932.70s]  Another $50. Five thousand more bits. You guys are crazy. Why are you giving me this much money
[1932.70s -> 1941.42s]  today? This is from Ishanji. Another $50 bit drop. They say bounty claimed. New prostate funds.
[1943.83s -> 1952.52s]  Thank you. Thanks. Bounty claimed. When are I going to play Demon's Souls?
[1953.16s -> 1963.48s]  Uh, when I get a PS5 maybe. Whenever that is. Oh, also I saw the sad news. Real sad news, guys.
[1963.48s -> 1973.75s]  Hitman 3 has the complete VR mode, right? Oh, that's so cool. It's only PSVR. And you can only play
[1973.75s -> 1988.46s]  it on the PS4 version of the game. What the hell? That's horrible. The PS5 version? You can't play
[1988.46s -> 1996.36s]  it on the PS5 version? Why can't you? Please tell me they're going to put that for, you know,
[1996.36s -> 2005.40s]  like the Vive and the Index and stuff, right? It's such a wasted opportunity. POV, your Jerma's
[2005.40s -> 2015.80s]  phone. There's one thing wrong with this image. It is the fact that this person is wearing,
[2016.68s -> 2033.88s]  uh, like cocky shorts. Do not wear, I don't wear cocky shorts. I wasn't even sad about it,
[2033.88s -> 2046.62s]  though. I was just panicking. Cocky. Pax, whatever. I'm not from the part of the world that you're
[2046.62s -> 2064.49s]  from. We talk differently. No one says it like that. I'm originally from Massachusetts, from
[2064.49s -> 2075.35s]  Boston. I'm from Boston. I'm from Boston. Sorry, that was really loud. This is it, man. We're here.
[2075.35s -> 2090.58s]  I'm here. Can I do this? Am I going to be able to do this shit? Let's go. Probably not. All right,
[2090.58s -> 2105.46s]  we got to save money because I, I want, okay, what do I want? Definitely the health. Let's see
[2105.46s -> 2116.71s]  what's in here. What do they do? I don't even know what they do. Holy shit in my pants. That's what
[2116.71s -> 2141.50s]  they do. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Good. We're good. Drink bath water. Drink bath
[2141.50s -> 2158.44s]  water. What? Just stun lock them. Very cool. All right. Almost got that HP upgrade. Why did I read
[2158.44s -> 2169.75s]  that? I don't know. Why did I read anything here? He won't raise it. Oh shit. That's shooting blades
[2169.75s -> 2214.62s]  out of me. Out at me. Out at me. Well, this room sucks. Die. Die. Poison. Poison. Poison. Who's left?
[2218.15s -> 2238.44s]  Oh my god damn it. I'm fucked. These saw blades, man, are killing me. All right. Good. All right.
[2238.44s -> 2257.80s]  I'm all right. I'm okay. Can we see you with your, nope. When is house flipper? Oh, well,
[2257.80s -> 2262.20s]  tomorrow is going to be chat's choice. There'll be a handful of things to choose from. Maybe it'll
[2262.20s -> 2274.76s]  be on there. I think I'm just going to buy one of these now. All right. Should I? I don't know what
[2274.76s -> 2296.98s]  to do. I mean, I feel like my weapon is really good. I'm just going to do the health. Do the health
[2296.98s -> 2305.19s]  and then I'm going to buy that one too. So what's available? All right. I could do another one of
[2305.19s -> 2335.99s]  these. Money, right? I could do them all, but it's dangerous. Earn him. I'll get a final upgrade to
[2335.99s -> 2350.74s]  this. Oh dude. Germa reference. Shit. I can't sell anything. Just because there's a rat in a video
[2350.74s -> 2375.00s]  game doesn't mean it's a Germa reference. Yo, Germa. Dude. Rat. Yes, it does. Well, wow. I almost
[2375.00s -> 2387.35s]  got hit. Give me those. I want these back. Stupid. Wait. No, no. There are no boons worth giving up.
[2387.35s -> 2403.82s]  I have a Germa reference infestation. What does that mean? I have a Germa reference infestation.
[2413.45s -> 2417.78s]  This is interesting. This is interesting. This is interesting. This is interesting.
[2423.80s -> 2432.44s]  Hold on. Whenever you cast damage foes around you and inflict chill, applying 10 stacks of
[2432.44s -> 2443.67s]  chill causes a blast. That's definitely what I want. Arctic blast gum. All right. And let's get
[2443.67s -> 2465.35s]  this too. I don't think I'm done. I want the money. Three plus your cast equals hog. That's true.
[2468.36s -> 2474.68s]  Maybe I should just go kill him. Should I just go for him? Is there a way to see how many revives
[2474.68s -> 2485.46s]  I have left? Where is that? Do I have two? Oh, bottom left. Okay. I have one revive left.
[2488.98s -> 2494.90s]  Shit. Do I go fight this asshole? Or do I try to get enough? I mean, I got full health.
[2495.62s -> 2509.78s]  Do I go? I'm going to fight him. Let's go. Let's go. I might lose a lot of HP. I have full health
[2509.78s -> 2514.57s]  and a revive. I'm going to play smart. All right. Here we go. See if I can beat this
[2514.57s -> 2520.25s]  motherfucker right now. Come on. Second try on Hades. Let's do it. Come on. I'm going to go for
[2520.25s -> 2537.10s]  it. Let's go. I'm going to go. I'm going to do it. Quiet. Not you be quiet. Me be quiet. Play smart.
[2537.10s -> 2556.98s]  Don't play smart. Not hard. Are you winning, son? Yes, dad, I am, if you want to know.
[2562.20s -> 2639.58s]  All right. I'm ready. Get it started. Already fucked it up. That hurt. Fuck you, dad.
[2639.58s -> 2647.27s]  Stop. Stop. What am I doing? Stop. The fucking goblin's taking over.
[2708.34s -> 2798.41s]  Where is he? Come on, father. All right. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got a full revive.
[2798.41s -> 2854.73s]  I got to throw. I'm not throwing. This is the end. It's all right. Bring me back. Bring me back.
[2878.71s -> 2885.45s]  Holy shit. That was insane. I'm dead. That was fucking insane. The whole entire area just
[2885.45s -> 2898.06s]  exploded. Every inch of everything was exploded. Second try. I didn't do it. I had to stand on a
[2898.06s -> 2916.97s]  pillar. Oh, what the fuck? The pillars blocked the laser. Yeah, but the whole area was poisoned.
[2916.97s -> 2922.23s]  All the ground was poisoned. I fucked it up. All the ground was poisonous. Oh, whatever. That's
[2922.23s -> 2940.38s]  attempt number two. I'm going to kill this motherfucker on the third try. That was intense.
[2944.33s -> 2956.28s]  I have to unlock the other weapon too. Should I unlock the fourth weapon yet?
[2964.41s -> 2979.86s]  I need the spear. I kind of have to use the shield wands, right? What's all this other stuff?
[2980.84s -> 2985.56s]  I have like two diamonds, three blood, two super potions. What do I do with these?
[2986.04s -> 3011.72s]  Fishing. Wait, what? Scoop creatures from the river? That's an entire diamond. Okay, I got it.
[3014.70s -> 3025.62s]  So I can fish in the waters? That's kind of crazy. What do you have to say, Nix?
[3025.62s -> 3030.82s]  I trust that the mirror in your bed chamber has proved satisfactory, dear child.
[3030.82s -> 3037.75s]  That I could have possibly imagined, Nix. You mentioned there was something more that it could
[3037.75s -> 3043.74s]  do once I had grown accustomed. I think I'm ready for that now. I think you are as well.
[3044.70s -> 3053.74s]  Then it shall be as you wish. Thank you. New talents? Oh shit, I can upgrade more stuff in
[3053.74s -> 3062.30s]  the mirror? Hey, the lounge is open. What is this place? What the hell? This is cool. A
[3062.30s -> 3069.70s]  commemorative ball of the stoicals within the celebrating and proclaiming the accomplishments
[3069.70s -> 3078.04s]  Meg, it is. I pissed on my phone so I can be like you. People happy.
[3078.68s -> 3085.32s]  Don't do that. Don't do that. I want to be like you. I peepee on phone.
[3094.82s -> 3115.37s]  I like the voices. They're good. Who's this? Slimer? Oh, it's Medusa.
[3115.61s -> 3119.56s]  I just wanted to say, don't bother picking up my room today.
[3119.56s -> 3133.40s]  I've been out for a while. May the box scrumptious kick. Greetings, chef.
[3133.40s -> 3145.75s]  There's a chef too? This is so cool. Can I do anything else in here?
[3146.47s -> 3149.59s]  Why does this guy look like a vendor? Oh, he is. Greetings, broker.
[3149.59s -> 3165.82s]  Oh, a diamond. This diamond's worth a lot, huh? Okay, I don't think I want to do any of this.
[3165.82s -> 3174.65s]  How many keys do I have? I have enough keys to unlock the mirror. Very, very cool.
[3175.29s -> 3185.05s]  Very nice. Awesome. What else can I do? Check the bottom. The bottom. 200 gemstones
[3186.12s -> 3197.75s]  for what? That's a lot of gems for just somebody's blood. Don't do it. It's not worth it. No, no,
[3197.75s -> 3211.10s]  no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this. But that's a lot of gems. Actually, I don't even
[3211.10s -> 3214.62s]  know what these things are for. So let's do that. Let's figure out what the blood is for first.
[3216.42s -> 3225.30s]  Upgraded the mirror, right? Don't listen to the Reddit chat.
[3228.84s -> 3232.68s]  Well, they're a Twitch chat. If it was a Reddit chat, I'd be streaming on Reddit, wouldn't I?
[3238.57s -> 3245.29s]  Okay, hold on. I got a lot of these. Boiling blood. Deal bonus attack and special damage
[3245.29s -> 3250.73s]  for foes with that in them. And this is Razor Supply. I can do more casts. I think I want that.
[3250.73s -> 3263.88s]  Check the left. You can switch every trait on the mirror now. Wait, I don't understand.
[3264.60s -> 3276.28s]  Press A to activate fiery presence instead of shadow presence. What the fuck? All right,
[3276.28s -> 3282.36s]  so deal bonus attack and special damage when striking undamaged foes versus people from behind.
[3282.36s -> 3290.02s]  This is restore some of your health when you collect that. 30% of the amount of the
[3290.02s -> 3302.31s]  dark power you collect versus... I think this one's better. Restore 50% of your health when you...
[3302.31s -> 3309.66s]  Wait a minute. What's this one turn into? Restore 30% instead of dying when your life
[3309.66s -> 3320.73s]  total is depleted one time per chamber. So you get to die just once total versus once per chamber.
[3320.73s -> 3329.70s]  That doesn't sound very good. 50% damage and dodge chance for two seconds when you dash
[3329.70s -> 3339.93s]  right before getting hit versus... You can... No. This one is... You do bonus damage to people that
[3339.93s -> 3344.58s]  have the diamond in them. And this is reduce movement speed and damage of foes with the
[3344.58s -> 3355.93s]  diamond in them. I like this one better. This is raising the supply of casts versus regenerate your
[3355.93s -> 3363.94s]  cast rather than pick it up. So you don't have to pick it up anymore. I kind of like that more.
[3364.58s -> 3382.70s]  Wait a minute. So that means I can cast and then four seconds later I can cast again.
[3382.70s -> 3385.74s]  So I can cast every three... That's awesome. Yeah, I'm gonna keep that.
[3387.38s -> 3397.45s]  And then I'll upgrade... Let's upgrade this. All right. 30% of all that collected we can keep that
[3397.45s -> 3414.33s]  on. Your dark regeneration was at 0%. How can I have a reset talents? Reclaim any? Oh, that's cool.
[3414.33s -> 3429.48s]  That's really cool. I can get all my talent points back. More dialogue from Skeleton.
[3434.76s -> 3438.01s]  That's not a wild reference. There's talent points in other games.
[3447.16s -> 3452.20s]  You can reset your talent points in like 20 RPGs that are on the market right now.
[3457.91s -> 3474.79s]  Okay. Spear. The range on this is insane. What? Hold for a spin attack? Skewer and recall?
[3475.75s -> 3495.21s]  Does it go through them again? It does. Dash strike. Cool. All right. Well, I have to try
[3495.21s -> 3503.24s]  a run with this. Let's put on the money thing. Wait. I don't want to just be like a like a two
[3503.80s -> 3523.11s]  trinket loser, right? This gets ranked up. Yeah. Put this on. Oh, I can dash with the charge? Wait.
[3523.11s -> 3537.98s]  Hold on. That's pretty awesome. That's really awesome. Two trinket Andy. Right.
[3538.78s -> 3556.12s]  I don't want to be that today. It's not that orderly really. That's a hundred damage. All
[3556.12s -> 3561.85s]  right. Somebody said I can upgrade the weapons. How do I do that? Have I unlocked the ability
[3561.85s -> 3572.39s]  to do that yet? You can't do that yet. Oh, all right. I'm going to give the spear a try.
[3582.84s -> 3606.86s]  Berries again. Is this doom too? Spoiling Andy. Okay. I can do doom or your cast sends a blade
[3606.86s -> 3615.78s]  rift. I did. I, yeah. Didn't I specifically upgrade the cast thing? That's pretty cool.
[3616.58s -> 3625.45s]  One, two, three. So I, can I reduce the casting time? Cause I'll just be rift Andy.
[3626.09s -> 3630.84s]  Fucking God damn it. I'm sorry. Like you guys just were saying it recently.
[3635.91s -> 3644.90s]  That's insane. Okay. Good. I still have to give him a gift. All right. We're going to go. We're
[3644.90s -> 3672.90s]  going to try doing rift. Spear is pretty good. You just did a rift. Oh, and I get the heal from
[3672.90s -> 3676.90s]  this, but it doesn't even matter. Cause I don't have any lower. Oh wait. Chaos, chaos, chaos,
[3676.90s -> 3717.75s]  chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos. I give chaos a gift. Can't. Oh, well whatever. The next three standard
[3717.75s -> 3726.07s]  encounters, you face 78% more foes afterwards wounds have a 33% chance to be rare or better.
[3726.71s -> 3733.72s]  Okay. The next four encounters get killed foes, toss an inferno bomb at you. Afterward,
[3733.72s -> 3741.08s]  you do 73% damage striking foes from behind. That's insane. The next four chambers chamber
[3741.08s -> 3751.56s]  reward previews are hidden. Afterward, your dash strike deals 41% more damage. I mean,
[3753.85s -> 3760.89s]  that's a, that's a lot more foes, but there's a third of a chance for them to be rare or better.
[3762.76s -> 3766.46s]  Try it. I'm probably going to get, I'm going to get my, I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[3767.02s -> 3784.82s]  This one for the health. Oh, by the gift. Okay. What is he going to rift? I'm just going to be very,
[3784.82s -> 3822.52s]  very cautious. Oh, right. That. Yeah. Cautious. He just shot at me. Stop shooting at me. Stop
[3822.52s -> 3850.04s]  doing that. Stop it. Backstab, backstab, backstab. Oh, there's a lot. Actually,
[3850.04s -> 3867.64s]  this is going on for a long time. This is going on for a very long time. Nectar, money, fame,
[3868.57s -> 3889.80s]  money, or fame, money, or fame. What I've noticed is money or upgrade. It's going on them all there.
[3889.80s -> 3904.01s]  Whatever. Yes. Oh, bad idea. Oh, what is that? Oh, that's like, I think that's the original
[3904.01s -> 3924.73s]  Macintosh you screwed up some. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Adventure time when
[3924.73s -> 3931.26s]  Finn's dad loses his leg. I did not watch enough Adventure Time to know what that is.
[3931.26s -> 3943.78s]  Is that a spoiler? What? That's like a major spoiler. Did I just ruin Adventure Time?
[3947.91s -> 3968.17s]  I didn't, I didn't mean to do that. Stupid. Oh my God. Oh, doesn't that just make the devil mad?
[3972.86s -> 3985.74s]  Oh, come on. Don't you just want to make the devil mad? Oh, shit. I'm going to die.
[3996.09s -> 4000.41s]  Just kill this fucking asshole. He's off the screen. I don't know where he is.
[4001.78s -> 4006.10s]  I've been killed in Diablo 2 by that exact problem like a thousand times.
[4008.42s -> 4011.54s]  You shoot out of like a sorcerer's orb and all of a sudden you hear,
[4013.38s -> 4015.22s]  and the lightning just comes off screen and kills you.
[4015.22s -> 4071.78s]  Oh, okay. Settle down. Settle down, clown. Oh, it did, did it. Yeah. All right. I have one health.
[4071.78s -> 4096.62s]  I think I need to go in here. Only 20. What? Okay. Now do I get the pomegranate? Do I get the
[4096.62s -> 4111.96s]  palm pomegranate or do I get the mystery bag? Oh, I don't know what this is. Okay. Your dash
[4111.96s -> 4118.34s]  causes hangover, right? Or you take less damage while it's 50%. 15% less damage. That's pretty
[4118.34s -> 4137.69s]  sick, dude. What do you think? 6k Andy, hyper omega low. But usually it's like 10k. But usually
[4137.69s -> 4150.66s]  it's like 8k. Cry, cry, cry. Feel bad for playing Hades two days in a row.
[4161.66s -> 4177.11s]  Go for Artemis? No, 6k, 10k, 5k, 4k, 12k, 100k. I don't care. I mean, I would care if there was 100k.
[4177.11s -> 4182.76s]  That would be a huge deal. That would be a huge fucking deal. So yeah, of course I would care
[4182.76s -> 4195.11s]  if there was 100,000 people here. Okay. So thankfully this is going to help me. Wait,
[4195.11s -> 4204.76s]  do I still have that one? Do I? Wait. Oh, take, get rid of this. Oh, I can't get rid of this.
[4206.65s -> 4224.89s]  Go fishing? Can I? How do I go fishing? Looks like it's blinking over here. Right? Oh, okay.
[4224.89s -> 4263.59s]  Fishing spots are gold sparkles. Wasn't that a gold sparkle? Whoa! Thank you. Never sub,
[4263.59s -> 4281.38s]  I never donated you. I don't care. All right, let's go. This is going to be Poseidon. Oh,
[4281.46s -> 4291.06s]  it's a boss. I'll block you again? All right. Just, just be easy. Be easy. And it's not an
[4291.06s -> 4296.02s]  ideal build for this situation. Although it very well could have been. Actually, it is pretty good.
[4296.90s -> 4326.90s]  What am I talking about? It's fantastic for this exact scenario. That hurt. Oh my God,
[4326.90s -> 4361.67s]  what's happening to me over here? Stop hitting me. I said stop that. I've given a gift to Zeus. Yes,
[4361.67s -> 4374.04s]  I have. My brothers will not die in vain. I can make as many Diablo references as I want today.
[4374.04s -> 4395.64s]  This is great. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Which one of these is a good one? Lightning Strike is pretty
[4395.64s -> 4405.42s]  good. Call makes lightning. Wait, do I have a call yet? Um, shit, I think. It's definitely this one.
[4405.42s -> 4420.09s]  It has to be. You're attacking with chain lightning. I mean, of course it is. Thunder and lightning.
[4420.09s -> 4428.36s]  Kind of, I'm not getting, I'm getting a lot of different gods. His Xanax kicked in. What?
[4435.42s -> 4447.05s]  Survive for 45 seconds. That chain lightning seriously is pretty good.
[4447.93s -> 4470.74s]  The purple thing was an enemy. That doesn't activate chain lightning. Oh, no.
[4482.26s -> 4488.90s]  Done. Nine health. Yeah, I'm kind of getting my ass kicked a little bit here.
[4491.02s -> 4498.63s]  I don't think I've given a gift to Chile. I have not. Here we go.
[4503.42s -> 4507.58s]  Lady Demeter, you've shown me warmth and generosity, and I am very grateful for it.
[4507.58s -> 4509.90s]  Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation.
[4512.39s -> 4520.34s]  Well suited for the season there, young Zagreus. In turn, as you are honorable and obedient,
[4521.14s -> 4523.54s]  you'll have from me what the mortals have not.
[4524.50s -> 4532.89s]  Breezing lightning slash? Ross Bitten Horn. Cool. I'll see what that is later.
[4537.61s -> 4539.85s]  This has reached you prior to me, Zagreus.
[4540.89s -> 4551.82s]  She seems cold. Sort of. Holy shit. What is that?
[4553.30s -> 4561.05s]  Your cast drops a crystal that fires a beam for five seconds. 24 to 12 every half second.
[4562.81s -> 4569.93s]  What does that do? Your call creates a winter vortex that grows over five seconds of licking
[4569.93s -> 4588.97s]  chill. 11 damage a second. Who cares about that one? This is a heroic one. Slicing Shot.
[4590.87s -> 4606.18s]  Wait. Slicing Shot replaces the spinner that I have with a crystal every 0.2 seconds,
[4606.18s -> 4611.82s]  but it's super rare. The Rift is better though. It replaces the vortex. Oh, that kind of sucks.
[4615.85s -> 4628.57s]  Ah. Jesus, it's not rocket science. I've got a, I've got a, look at, I've got a legend,
[4628.57s -> 4635.34s]  I've got a heroic boon here that I'm trying to decide if I want to keep it. I'm just deciding.
[4636.94s -> 4644.98s]  I'm not going to write a thesis paper about it. All right, Dementor's Aid. I think I want this
[4644.98s -> 4654.81s]  one. I want to keep the Rift. Yeah. I want to keep the Rift. I like it. I like it slow. It moves.
[4654.81s -> 4661.58s]  I like it. I like it. So that's a call. I'm probably going to live long enough to care
[4661.58s -> 4666.41s]  about it anyway. All right. What's this? Oh, restore a hundred health. After I do this. I
[4666.41s -> 4670.01s]  forgot this. Okay. Well, wait, wait, wait. We're going to use Dementor's Call. It's like,
[4670.01s -> 4689.80s]  did you call security? I'm dead. I don't, well, that sucks. I already wasted a death.
[4702.79s -> 4726.66s]  I just, I forgot the, whatever. Bullshit. I'm annoyed by that. Reset? No. This thing does have
[4726.66s -> 4734.94s]  huge range. Why am I getting so close? I'm treating it like a sword. This thing has enormous
[4734.94s -> 4755.66s]  range. I'm treating it like the sword. What's wrong with me? Many things. All right. Time that
[4755.66s -> 4774.20s]  guy out for two hours. He was right though. Time that person out that just said that for three
[4774.20s -> 4795.00s]  hours. They were both right. I want you to time that person out for six hours. All of them are
[4795.00s -> 4801.82s]  right. I want you to give that guy everything he's ever wanted and hope his life is perfect
[4801.82s -> 4823.88s]  from here on out. That's a flex. I didn't know that did that. Okay. That changes everything.
[4823.88s -> 4826.76s]  That's why I wasn't using it that often because I was afraid to get hit by projectiles.
[4840.57s -> 4851.10s]  Boon of Germa. I don't even know what I would give. All right. What like element would I be?
[4851.99s -> 4865.03s]  Water, fire, ice, earth, air, chaos, metal, meat? What element? Imagine taking a what element are
[4865.03s -> 4880.47s]  you quiz and you get meat. I feel that's pretty good. Ensure a chaos gate will spawn.
[4882.17s -> 4893.74s]  I'm doing that one. I bought this game because of you. It's great. I'm glad you like it. It's
[4893.74s -> 4911.83s]  very good. All right. I think we're going to. All right. Here comes Meg. All right. Goodbye.
[4915.21s -> 4920.18s]  I refunded this game because of you. Odd. Odd thing to do.
[4920.66s -> 4926.17s]  Tell me something, Zach, because I'm curious. Do your Olympian relatives know the real reason
[4926.17s -> 4934.10s]  you've been trying to escape? Get around to that in due time. A family. Did anyone happen to steal a
[4934.10s -> 4941.30s]  red spy? You're in over your head, you idiot. You'll fray what bonds are left between Lord Hades
[4941.30s -> 4951.90s]  and those ingrates on Olympus. How often do I say that line? I feel like I do it all the time.
[4952.62s -> 4992.62s]  Too close. Here she goes. Excuse me. All right. I'm going to do Mother's Mayhem. I don't even know
[4992.62s -> 4996.14s]  what the movie is called. I'm just going to call it what I'm going to call it so I can have it in
[4996.14s -> 5004.20s]  my own brain. I know what move I'm talking about. All right. Let's do Mother's Mayhem.
[5004.84s -> 5038.58s]  Mother's Mayhem is pretty good. Ow. Right into the trap. It just threw me off. What?
[5068.44s -> 5076.95s]  Double tap. The only damage I've taken this entire game in this boss fight has
[5076.95s -> 5108.97s]  been from the fucking floor trap. Almost happened again. No. Screed. This game seems a little easy
[5108.97s -> 5120.89s]  or are you good? Yes. I don't know. Look, it has four buttons. That means I can do okay.
[5120.89s -> 5132.18s]  I've refused to believe he's good. I almost beat the last boss on my first try. You gotta
[5132.18s -> 5145.13s]  give me credit sometimes where I deserve it. If the game has four buttons, I will do okay.
[5145.13s -> 5153.02s]  It's the games that have WASD, mouse, 10 items, a bag full of stuff, crafting,
[5153.02s -> 5158.14s]  and a giant quest log that I have to keep track of and oh go talk to this guy and go look you're
[5158.14s -> 5160.78s]  gonna go through that it's like a maze you're gonna find this guy at the end of that tunnel.
[5160.78s -> 5176.90s]  No. Give me four buttons. Give me an analog stick and I will smoke that game. Let's just do it.
[5176.90s -> 5182.58s]  All right. So a lot of these god boons are just to make it so you get their boon first.
[5187.19s -> 5194.71s]  What difficulty am I on? I dragged the slider up as far as it could go. I don't know. It was
[5194.71s -> 5202.39s]  easy, medium, hard, insane, psycho, and torture and I think I was somewhere between insane and
[5202.39s -> 5214.46s]  psycho and torture. I think it was closer to torture. It really is too bad that this is so good.
[5216.22s -> 5219.34s]  Two more encounters and this ranks up. Does that mean I get to come back three times?
[5226.95s -> 5235.75s]  No. It's more life. Oh, that's still good though. All right, let's go.
[5236.23s -> 5253.24s]  I see you, Tartarus. Give me back my tooth. I've been timed out for 3.627e plus seven minutes.
[5253.24s -> 5276.84s]  What? Why did you just break your iPhone calculator? Oh, there it is. I can fish down here?
[5277.99s -> 5288.54s]  What? Oh, come on. I couldn't have got a chaos fish. That's too bad.
[5289.10s -> 5304.44s]  No fish. No fish. Well.
[5307.51s -> 5315.30s]  The next three encounters, each time you special, get hit minus four. Afterwards,
[5315.30s -> 5327.85s]  you gain another... Oh, well, that's exactly what I wanted to do this run. Or just a bunch of max
[5327.85s -> 5340.02s]  health or... Oh, that's really good too though. That's so good. Any money you find is increased
[5340.02s -> 5350.65s]  by 45% after that happens. But this lets me cast two rifts and it's a three second cooldown.
[5351.21s -> 5361.67s]  I'm going with the rifts. What was the downside? I didn't care. Oh, for the next three encounters,
[5361.67s -> 5365.83s]  each time you special... I don't even press triangle anyways. I don't play... I never press
[5365.83s -> 5402.98s]  Y anyways. Who cares? Great. These guys, I'm either doing not very much damage or these guys
[5402.98s -> 5421.03s]  have a lot of health right now. I don't think I'm doing a lot of damage. What the hell? Not
[5421.03s -> 5455.54s]  doing a whole lot of damage. This is not looking all right. Get out of the fire. One, two, three.
[5456.79s -> 5469.93s]  Oh, what am I doing? One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One,
[5469.93s -> 5486.90s]  two, three. That's right. That video where the guy, he goes, that's an old one. I want this.
[5486.90s -> 5495.32s]  Oh my fucking God. That's a really good meme. It's the guy trying to do the old like first man
[5496.04s -> 5537.46s]  ever voice, right? Like the caveman voice. Oh shoot. Oh shoot. Lucky tooth ranked up. Nice.
[5539.85s -> 5546.87s]  And a shop with money in it. I mean, with hearts in it. Thank you. Wait, what else is on there?
[5551.74s -> 5576.81s]  I want that too. Oh, well, I hate this thing. Just queue it up for when they eventually spawn.
[5593.50s -> 5661.78s]  Don't do it. Blow it up. One, two, one. Hey, that was unfair. Oh, come on. Can I please.
[5661.78s -> 5679.50s]  You're making me look bad. He's a slippery one. Peewee Herman voice. I gave him a gift. All right.
[5679.50s -> 5689.86s]  I did not. How have I not given a diet? I have not. Great getting to know you. So please accept
[5689.86s -> 5695.18s]  this humble offer. Play the one, two, three video. Hold on. I will. All right. What is this? Is this
[5695.18s -> 5705.38s]  it right? Let's try male human voice. Count over three. One, two, three. Just pitch up your voice.
[5706.50s -> 5714.34s]  One, two, three. Let's just add a bit of nasal now. One, two, three. Now the other thing that
[5714.34s -> 5721.94s]  would be happening, which would actually increase that quality is a very heavy skull that seems to
[5721.94s -> 5729.46s]  pull down into the throat there. Now speak. One, two, three. Now let's make a sound. Just
[5729.46s -> 5742.62s]  let's make a huge R. That's one of my favorite videos. One, two, three.
[5742.86s -> 5748.78s]  Here's something. A right princely gift there, Zack. And just so happens, I got something here
[5748.78s -> 5766.95s]  I have been meaning to give you. Get a big really heavy skull. Overflowing cup. I like this guy the
[5766.95s -> 5782.74s]  most. Ionite is my favorite god. Uh, well, okay. This one's good, but this one's better.
[5802.63s -> 5808.89s]  You've re-gifted it back to you. Oh, did I, did I give him like a bread maker for Christmas?
[5808.89s -> 5812.81s]  And he just doesn't even know how to, he doesn't have the, the, doesn't even want to open it out
[5812.81s -> 5822.14s]  of the box. Doesn't want to take it out because it's a ton of work. I don't want to do this shit,
[5822.14s -> 5825.66s]  man. I'll give this to somebody else. I don't think, you know, I don't think a bread maker's
[5825.66s -> 5830.78s]  ever been opened on Christmas. Somebody, it just gets rewrapped and gives to another party
[5830.78s -> 5847.22s]  over and over and over again. Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab him, stab him, stab him.
[5847.22s -> 5864.89s]  That's a stand-up comedian joke. Whatever. Look, all right, so whatever, whatever, whatever.
[5877.48s -> 5888.65s]  Oh, oh, I can do two casts in a row because, right, right, right, right, right, right,
[5888.65s -> 5903.85s]  because of the thing that I got. Right, I forgot, I forgot. Ooh, hey, oh, did I gift?
[5904.49s -> 5911.18s]  I already, wait, should I do gift two? No, you already had a gift. What does two gifts do?
[5914.01s -> 5939.69s]  Just one gift, okay. What's going on with his eyes? That eye is filled with blood. You should
[5939.69s -> 5951.24s]  probably go get that looked at. Okay, here we go. We can either do two random boons of yours are
[5951.24s -> 5960.28s]  upgraded to the next rarity right now, four random boons gain a level, or the next three boons will
[5960.36s -> 5974.66s]  have upgraded rarity. Probably this one, this one, or this one. Wait, don't I already have the
[5974.66s -> 5986.86s]  upgraded rarity thing already? So would this eat, that would be even more. They might be legendaries.
[5990.55s -> 6027.70s]  That's a big deal. They might be like heroics and legendaries. This is nice. Dude, one time,
[6027.70s -> 6032.81s]  I don't know why this reminded me of this, but the original Punisher movie had a song in it
[6033.45s -> 6046.25s]  that was like, you may come back someday, live once more, die once more. So forget about that part.
[6046.25s -> 6053.69s]  The part that I'm referring to is in college. I remember in the DVD player, that was what played
[6053.69s -> 6060.02s]  on loop at the menu screen. And I remember falling asleep with that in the DVD player,
[6060.02s -> 6067.99s]  the Punisher DVD, and waking up every, I would say, five to 10 minutes over the course of like
[6067.99s -> 6076.87s]  three or four hours to, you may come back someday, live once more. And I just don't care. I'm too
[6076.87s -> 6086.57s]  tired to get up and turn it off. It was at least three or four hours. It was just on the cycling
[6086.57s -> 6095.93s]  the menu song. It's very funny because I kept waking up to you may come back someday. So eyes
[6095.93s -> 6104.98s]  open, you may come back someday. One day, maybe I'm going to sleep. You may come back. So I'm
[6104.98s -> 6116.12s]  coming. I'm back again, but please, I'd like to go to sleep. Why did I keep doing it? I don't know.
[6116.12s -> 6120.52s]  Eventually I just like stumbled out of the bed and just like smashed on every button on the DVD
[6120.52s -> 6127.32s]  player and hope that it turned it off. Oh, actually, I think I walked up and just hit,
[6127.32s -> 6133.75s]  you know what the quickest way to turn a DVD off was just open the disc tray. Just walk up,
[6133.75s -> 6139.00s]  press open disc tray button, go back to bed. But then you'd have the problem where you just have a
[6139.00s -> 6146.25s]  blue TV. That's stuck too. Because now you have a new problem. You have this blue burning light
[6146.25s -> 6151.72s]  that's just always on you. So you got to do open the disc tray, turn the TV power button off and
[6151.72s -> 6168.79s]  go back to bed. Uh, this is, I kind of want the health. Damn, that's pretty good. After using a
[6168.79s -> 6183.34s]  call, you deal more damage for 15 seconds. Your lightning effects make foes jolted. Yeah. Jolted
[6183.34s -> 6194.25s]  really is just so broken that this is cool, but this is broken. I'm doing a cool one.
[6204.30s -> 6208.42s]  Oh, here we go. This is it. I should have taken the health. What am I doing? It's not broken.
[6208.42s -> 6211.94s]  It's bad. That's what I mean. It's like, so it's just broken. It sucks so much. Like why would you
[6211.94s -> 6225.48s]  even use it needs to be updated. What did you think I was talking about? All right. This one
[6225.48s -> 6240.81s]  shouldn't be too bad considering I have the, uh, the rift. Yeah. Why? I was so complacent. Don't
[6240.81s -> 6261.85s]  give. All right. Quiet. All right. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good.
[6261.85s -> 6292.15s]  Now we're going to do this. Come on, dude. What are you doing? What am I actually doing? I'm
[6292.15s -> 6323.40s]  getting so close for no reason. What the fuck am I doing here? All right. Let's go into the fire.
[6324.38s -> 6344.81s]  Into the fire. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[6344.81s -> 6351.67s]  into the fire. Stop the fire. My favorite God in spite, by the way, best character,
[6351.67s -> 6385.56s]  coolest move set. You didn't get enough love. Go, go do it. We're good. Play smite. I played
[6385.56s -> 6395.43s]  smite for like 10 minutes. LOL. What the fuck is going on today? Uh, you know, I replaced words
[6395.43s -> 6401.53s]  with just like a laugh, I guess I'm busy playing a game. So I don't have, I can't like really talk
[6401.53s -> 6406.65s]  that much unless I'm taking a break like this. So replace like words with just laugh in a weird
[6406.65s -> 6429.34s]  way. That's odd, right? I'm like every bad guy in a children's show. They say a sentence and then
[6429.34s -> 6446.50s]  they laugh like that. This is good. Oh, this restores 100 health. You have to micromanage
[6446.50s -> 6454.30s]  brain RAM. Yeah, guys, I don't know how many of you guys might know this. Some of you might be new
[6454.30s -> 6469.00s]  viewers. I have like two gigs of memory, but it's incredibly fast. It's very fast, but there's only
[6469.00s -> 6488.46s]  two gigs. It's two gigs of like DDR five 6400 megahertz RAM. This is not a whole lot of it.
[6489.02s -> 6506.10s]  I don't have any money anyways. You have a 24 max FPS brain speed. What about your CPU?
[6507.43s -> 6517.66s]  Um, that's okay. My CPU, my CPU is like a 32 core 10 gig overclocked CPU, but then it runs
[6517.74s -> 6529.08s]  into my two gigahertz tube, two gigabyte RAM. It gets stuck. My graphics card sucks ass too.
[6529.08s -> 6537.54s]  My eyes are terrible. I'm running. I have like a, okay, I have a mobile graphics card up here in my
[6537.54s -> 6547.38s]  head. My vision's not very good and I miss things. I'm really slow like visually a lot of the time.
[6547.38s -> 6553.62s]  I have like a, okay, I don't even have a G force. I have old ATI, old AMD. See back in the day,
[6553.62s -> 6562.04s]  AMD graphics cards. We're not the cool thing. I have like an ATI mobility radion 1100 M.
[6562.04s -> 6579.38s]  I can fish here. Where's the fishing spot? Oh, come on. Just a lore.
[6589.67s -> 6624.90s]  So what's the point of the fishing rod? Hammer, always hammer. Blow it up. Oh my
[6624.90s -> 6640.26s]  God. Those things attack you. Good. Who's next? Bring it on. Oopsie.
[6647.74s -> 6665.26s]  Don't let him shoot you. Another one? Who has the, who's shooting at me? It's not you.
[6665.26s -> 6674.09s]  I don't have your bow out. Who the hell's aiming at me? Who was you? Your special becomes a shot
[6674.09s -> 6679.05s]  that deals 50 base damage in an area. Boring. Hold special for up to 200% base damage and minimum
[6679.05s -> 6690.44s]  range reduced. Your special deals 50% damage. Wait, that's pretty good. So the special deals
[6690.44s -> 6706.49s]  plus 50% damage and plus 50% critical chance on recovery. What does on recovery mean? On recovery
[6710.17s -> 6721.91s]  when you call it back. But, oh, right. Okay. I don't really use the special that often. I really
[6721.91s -> 6740.20s]  don't. Maybe this would be better. 200%. There's a lot though. I'll try this because it crits,
[6740.20s -> 6747.98s]  right? So when you pull it back. Okay. Maybe I'll use it sometimes. Eh, I'm not happy with any of
[6747.98s -> 6777.37s]  that. Oh, I mean it's, it's good. It's good. But it's a lot to pay attention to. It's good. It's,
[6777.37s -> 6811.08s]  it's 135 damage is a lot. I said to remember to use it. Ah, trap. Hey, hey. Two gigabytes can't
[6811.08s -> 6830.54s]  load the image. No, I just get stuck. Oh, more singing. This is different. This is different.
[6834.95s -> 6842.57s]  Most covered chambers cut of stone stand untold numbers of eternal monuments in tribute to the
[6842.57s -> 6848.41s]  greatest heroes which mortality can offer there to honor them in life as well as death.
[6849.13s -> 6853.93s]  This is a new character. This place is near as gloomy as the house.
[6856.82s -> 6868.86s]  This is a new character. Oh, it's the bod. Hello, bod. Go on stranger. More shades looking to fight
[6868.86s -> 6876.38s]  with you out there. I'm just passing through. You seem less warlike than the rest. May I ask
[6876.38s -> 6882.30s]  your name, sir? I'm Zagreus. My name is the bod. Names are there to be forgotten, stranger.
[6883.18s -> 6889.18s]  You shouldn't be here. May the fates favor your journey. But just in case they don't.
[6889.98s -> 6897.66s]  Oh, he's a wicked cool character. Oh, the shade offers one of several premium goods.
[6899.54s -> 6911.48s]  That's good. That's also very good. Holy shit, this guy's unbelievable. Oh my god.
[6916.63s -> 6920.63s]  One but ten encounters. How many encounters are left in the game?
[6930.39s -> 6933.99s]  All right, hold on a minute. If there's only a few more rooms left that means I'll have
[6933.99s -> 6978.30s]  60% more damage for the last boss. Refill me. He's a shield user. I want this. Excuse me. Did I
[6978.30s -> 7004.68s]  get by a trap? I did. Of course I did. Don't you respawn. I got to drop this somewhere.
[7005.32s -> 7030.98s]  Who's alive? Again. Holy fuck. Oh my god. Very bad. Very bad. Where are the bows? You
[7040.12s -> 7077.72s]  asshole with the bow. Almost did actually. Delicious. Delicious. Okay. That's really good.
[7077.72s -> 7083.02s]  Number three is unbelievable. You're attacking its chain lightning. So it's just better chain
[7083.02s -> 7091.08s]  lighting. But this is a full almost 10% more damage after hitting right trigger. This is extra.
[7091.08s -> 7103.59s]  Oh, don't. What are you doing? I think they're all very good. All right. What is better just
[7103.59s -> 7118.90s]  statistically doing 15 damage every 0.25 seconds or doing 8% more damage after doing it? Probably
[7118.90s -> 7136.50s]  the third one, right? You want to use it more often. Please click that link so they stop posting
[7136.50s -> 7153.43s]  it. I don't know. I want to do more all around damage. I'm going for it. Whatever. All right.
[7153.43s -> 7176.07s]  I'll open the link. This is my boon. I didn't get a chance to see it yet. Let's see. All of your
[7176.07s -> 7182.95s]  attacks lose 50% damage, but you get a slice of bologna. Take it. Do it. That's worth it.
[7184.79s -> 7200.74s]  That's actually worth it. How much does the bologna heal? Boomer. Oh, my God. I almost quit
[7200.74s -> 7214.49s]  the game. Boomer sense of humor. What? Come on. That's cute. Um, I need that. I got to heal.
[7215.64s -> 7240.87s]  Sorry, Ares. Do not hit me under any gosh darn circumstances. You hit me. You hit me. They hit.
[7252.76s -> 7280.10s]  Okay. Oh, no. I'm not done. Oh, shit. Who the fuck? Oh, it's this guy with the bow
[7280.10s -> 7288.22s]  back here. You dick. I hate you. Of course, you guys get to hang out in these like traps.
[7299.61s -> 7303.80s]  God, why can you shoot across the whole screen? Game just went down one point.
[7305.98s -> 7324.34s]  Game just went down one point. It was a 92. Now it's a 91. You just went down a whole. You went
[7324.34s -> 7337.75s]  down one millipoint. Spam your cast. I'm using it almost every time. Uh, I'm gonna have to do
[7337.75s -> 7356.26s]  this one. This is a 92, but Lego Island isn't. I've never played Lego Island. I have no idea
[7356.26s -> 7368.41s]  what Lego Island even is. What do I do? I'm gonna heal 10% for the next few rooms, which is
[7368.41s -> 7383.42s]  like 15 health. I could take the boon or I could take the even more HP. I could get this and I
[7383.42s -> 7389.75s]  don't have enough for that, do I? I could do both. Always boon. Always boon. Always boon. Always boon.
[7397.90s -> 7416.76s]  Oh, yes. No. Yes. Oh, no. Your special is stronger and it looks chill.
[7418.36s -> 7432.74s]  So much more damage, but, uh, we're going. I gotta go long term here. I have to go long term.
[7445.26s -> 7452.33s]  That's it. One is long term. Yeah. But three is longer term because now I heal from more,
[7452.33s -> 7458.38s]  no matter what, from every source. And I needed that health because I'm about to fight the boss.
[7463.54s -> 7472.49s]  One away from the meal. Yeah. Oh well. Three is a short term, a hundred percent. All right.
[7474.09s -> 7489.26s]  Really? I didn't get a chance. Don't hit me. Come on. The little guys are going back.
[7495.35s -> 7516.49s]  Literally have no idea what just happened. I think I killed them. Just actually hit me.
[7516.49s -> 7577.82s]  No, you didn't. There's more? Jesus. Ow. How did you really just bounce off that shit? Come on,
[7577.82s -> 7610.41s]  dude. Lost HP already. Yeah. These, these rooms are fucking crazy. I'll get it back. Do not pick
[7610.41s -> 7685.99s]  that up. Do not pick that up. No, I hate this place. Kill, kill, kill. More? More? More? More?
[7685.99s -> 7694.30s]  I just spit. I spit everywhere. It's everywhere. It's so bad. It's like I sprayed my mirror in my
[7694.30s -> 7710.15s]  bathroom with Windex. It's insane. Hold on. This is disgusting. It's horrible. It's everywhere.
[7713.00s -> 7731.06s]  Oh no. This is not good. Gotta fix that. It's okay. I got it. I'm getting it. The thing,
[7731.06s -> 7746.73s]  there's a shop. Oh, I missed it. It's okay. Show the spit and that's gross. Boss time.
[7747.45s -> 7755.38s]  It's boss time and I'm not ready. I'm in deep shit here.
[7768.78s -> 7785.66s]  That's good. Three dashes is always good. 16 extra gold per chamber is really good too,
[7785.66s -> 7803.40s]  but I need this. Thank you. All right. Triple dash. I have a revive. I don't think this is
[7803.40s -> 7817.43s]  the one. I'm not sure this is the run. I can dash five times? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I changed my
[7817.43s -> 7834.87s]  mind. Can I change my mind? That's unbelievable. That's cool. Okay. But I don't, I'm not very good
[7834.87s -> 7857.06s]  with the spear though. Whatever. Let's go. Don't give up. You got it. That's true. I have a full
[7857.06s -> 7867.62s]  revive and I have five dash. That just changed everything. You got this king. Thanks.
[7867.62s -> 7867.70s]  Thanks.
[7886.90s -> 7930.70s]  I feel like I'm like abusing it. Oh my God. Okay. Pay attention. Just play smart. Wow.
[7948.58s -> 7953.83s]  What the fuck am I doing standing still?
[7991.46s -> 7997.59s]  God damn it. This build is not good. I'm not going with the spear. I feel like this is taking
[7997.59s -> 8033.30s]  it forever. They haven't even called it Athena yet. I'm dead.
[8056.38s -> 8100.02s]  Crushing this up, you fucking truck. This is so long. Get him, get him, get him. Oh, here we go.
[8100.02s -> 8151.94s]  This is bad. Get the fuck away from me. Will you walk into this, please? Ow, that hurt. Jesus.
[8179.70s -> 8219.56s]  Oh my goodness. I just wasn't doing any damage. Spear is not for me.
[8219.56s -> 8244.23s]  Sounded like Gary when he ate. Sounded like Spongebob when he ate Gary's food.
[8248.73s -> 8261.93s]  I just don't, I wasn't doing enough damage. Oh, you're back. Did I give him a gift? I needed
[8261.93s -> 8268.01s]  that special boon that you gave up. Yeah, so that's just how the cookie crumbles, isn't it?
[8268.01s -> 8285.70s]  Made one wrong decision. I like shield and I like bow.
[8286.34s -> 8289.22s]  And if you're also concerned about our court musician,
[8289.22s -> 8293.62s]  why don't you commute to sentence yourself? Seeing as I haven't gotten around to it yet.
[8294.26s -> 8301.08s]  Howard, that's fine. Sure. I get to live. I'll just ask the house contractor since you're too busy.
[8306.09s -> 8309.69s]  Contractor, mind locating the court musician's sentence when you get the chance.
[8309.69s -> 8314.20s]  Oh, I actually, I think I have some quests to do, right? I'm going to give him a gift
[8314.20s -> 8327.96s]  because I haven't given him a gift yet. Hey, you think you can butter me up with such trifles?
[8328.68s -> 8342.44s]  Give me that out of here. You're welcome, father. Shall we get back to work? What the hell? Wait.
[8343.70s -> 8353.62s]  Well, next. Did I give him another one? He needs two. Why are you here? More pets. I got more pets
[8353.62s -> 8370.39s]  here, boy. I see. I've heard enough. Granted. Granted what? Oh, all right, let's see. I got 20.
[8371.93s -> 8380.87s]  Court musician, free Orpheus from solitary confinement. In the name of Hades,
[8380.87s -> 8392.46s]  I commute our court musician sentencing effective now. Hello? Ah, Orpheus. Am I composed entirely of
[8392.46s -> 8402.36s]  gemstones? I mean, I have another one. What do you do? Hello, Zagreus. I understand you liberated me
[8402.36s -> 8408.36s]  from my eternal punishment, and so I have returned to serve your father here. Thanks.
[8409.99s -> 8412.87s]  Morpheus, Orpheus, Dickus, Malicious.
[8416.87s -> 8421.45s]  What the hell are you doing? I was in all caps, by the way.
[8421.45s -> 8431.85s]  Morpheus, you're back. Look, don't get on father's bad side like that and you're going to be fine.
[8432.57s -> 8437.37s]  Besides, right now I think he's angry with me. You guys are fucking hilarious.
[8438.01s -> 8448.36s]  Now, some people don't like the insanity, but I love it. I love the stream of just insane
[8448.36s -> 8464.76s]  consciousness. Are you 12? No, I'm 35, if you didn't know. You're not gonna be 36. What the fuck?
[8465.98s -> 8474.70s]  I gotta, like, stop wearing suits and, like, pants and ties. Once I turn 36, 37, I guess I wear,
[8474.70s -> 8484.47s]  like, clothes. I have to start combing my hair all the way from one side to the other. It doesn't
[8484.47s -> 8486.87s]  matter what kind of hair I have, I just have to start doing that.
[8495.19s -> 8504.54s]  I felt that way about 25, then 27, then 30. That feeling never goes away.
[8504.54s -> 8514.02s]  I think that feeling turns into acceptance. Act broken. Shit. Can I give a gift?
[8517.29s -> 8524.31s]  I think at 40 that just turns into life, you know, that's it. Like, okay, you're 40 now.
[8524.95s -> 8531.35s]  There's no more like, well, you know, I'm like 30 still. I'm like turning 37. No, you're 40.
[8531.91s -> 8538.15s]  Oh. All of your teachers are 40. All of my teachers are 40. Like, I'm an old teacher now.
[8543.80s -> 8554.55s]  Midlife crisis? Yeah, at 40. I'm gearing up for the midlife crisis in, like, five years.
[8562.44s -> 8569.45s]  What's this? Prophecy fulfilled.
[8575.88s -> 8579.72s]  It's intended purpose to enliven the house's grim inhabitants.
[8579.72s -> 8581.64s]  All right, this is pretty cool.
[8581.64s -> 8582.84s]  It's better than nothing.
[8582.84s -> 8590.46s]  Fresh pomegranates and bread? This actually sucks. A steady diet of pomegranates,
[8591.67s -> 8602.71s]  French bread, and fish. Is it? I'm not into that.
[8602.71s -> 8609.86s]  Wretched broker, what's new, my friend?
[8611.06s -> 8614.81s]  I can still do that. I don't think I'm going to do this, though.
[8616.90s -> 8619.61s]  Where's the mayo? No, where's the...
[8621.38s -> 8629.29s]  Anything but onions, pomegranates, bread, and fish. Oh, hi.
[8646.36s -> 8651.14s]  To the point where that head gets attached to something and then all of a sudden she gets
[8651.14s -> 8658.95s]  powers and can control stuff again. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, no, I'm not, like, I'm
[8658.95s -> 8664.12s]  not, oh, no, no, no, I'm going to kill you all. That probably happens, right?
[8673.82s -> 8677.26s]  Here we go. Ooh, 80.
[8679.56s -> 8681.16s]  Very cool. All right, what else do I got?
[8683.05s -> 8685.53s]  Oh, who have I met? I've not met three other people.
[8693.22s -> 8700.60s]  Merciful End. Wait, there's two other weapons?
[8700.60s -> 8705.48s]  What the hell are you talking about?
[8706.28s -> 8717.51s]  All right, I think I want to do a key run. That makes that so much better.
[8717.51s -> 8725.24s]  Okay, 60% now. Damage is from behind. 40%.
[8730.44s -> 8737.00s]  Yeah, I did get a bunch of gems. That's right. Oh, wait, you're back.
[8737.00s -> 8738.04s]  Oh, let's eavesdrop.
[8738.04s -> 8743.64s]  You are not to aid him in these matters, Nix. His foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded.
[8743.64s -> 8747.34s]  Do we have an understanding?
[8751.94s -> 8756.74s]  We have an understanding, Hades, yes. He is your own son, after all,
[8756.74s -> 8763.30s]  and therefore your responsibility. I, in turn, have my commitments to this realm and to this house.
[8763.30s -> 8766.82s]  You're gonna read chat? I do. I'm way more than you think I do.
[8767.70s -> 8775.70s]  It is not necessary to remind me. Surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself
[8775.70s -> 8780.74s]  would much prefer a post within my house over eternity within the lowest depths of Tartarus.
[8781.78s -> 8783.86s]  Not that the darkness there would trouble you.
[8784.50s -> 8790.71s]  You know how a lot of you guys say, how did you miss what they were just talking about?
[8791.27s -> 8795.77s]  Oh, is it possible that you missed everything that you said? They just said it.
[8795.77s -> 8799.03s]  Well, because I wasn't paying attention to them, I was paying attention to you.
[8799.03s -> 8804.82s]  I was reading your lore during that. I have no idea what they just said.
[8804.82s -> 8807.94s]  I have absolutely no fucking idea at all. I was looking at over here.
[8807.94s -> 8810.42s]  I was seeing, like, what's going on over here in, like, the stadium.
[8810.42s -> 8827.53s]  The arena. The stadium. The stadium with 6,600 people in the stadium for tonight's game.
[8827.53s -> 8843.99s]  We are, like, the Cincinnati Reds. Is that sports?
[8843.99s -> 8857.85s]  Yeah. Wasn't there a season where the Cincinnati Reds lost, like, 14 games in a season or something?
[8857.85s -> 8862.07s]  Yeah. Oh, that's so sad. That's sad, man.
[8864.28s -> 8867.56s]  Okay, chambers may contain urns. I think it's time to get this.
[8867.56s -> 8876.41s]  To smash everything, right? Or a fountain chamber in Elcium.
[8876.41s -> 8882.15s]  Underworld fountains, holy. Fountains provide more health than usual. That's even better.
[8890.71s -> 8899.14s]  Mash pots. Smash pots and add a fountain to Elcium.
[8905.61s -> 8915.96s]  And I want new curtains. I want a scrying pool.
[8927.05s -> 8929.85s]  And I thought, I thought it said bug safety.
[8937.90s -> 8947.99s]  Excuse me? Pardon me? Listen to what? Oh, I could have just listened to something. Go back.
[8951.99s -> 8968.07s]  No! What's this? Renovate. Oh. Can I go in that?
[8979.51s -> 8992.94s]  Escape attempted. Oh, it tells you how, okay. Killed 1,700 people, let's try to escape six times.
[8992.94s -> 9000.66s]  Go to bed. Earlier. What is this?
[9018.89s -> 9024.65s]  All is quiet at this time. Ever dreaming Hypnos put a spell upon the house,
[9024.65s -> 9030.41s]  as Wilful Zagreus had asked of him. All are fast asleep, save for the prince.
[9031.37s -> 9034.49s]  It is exactly as he planned. Okay.
[9034.49s -> 9037.29s]  Lower your voice, old man. I'm trying to be sneaky here.
[9037.29s -> 9045.10s]  I'm trying to sneak around my dad's quarters. I'm gonna put peanut butter in his slippers.
[9045.74s -> 9059.45s]  He ventures toward the stately throne of his lord father, but ill, expecting what he is about to find.
[9059.45s -> 9063.96s]  I said shut up, old man. He does not know exactly what he seeks.
[9063.96s -> 9067.80s]  What? Is this like a- He only knows that something always has felt off to him,
[9068.60s -> 9076.15s]  that he does not belong. Who is he, really? Lord Hades never would indulge such questions.
[9077.19s -> 9082.62s]  So Prince Zagreus would find out for himself. I'm not listening.
[9083.83s -> 9086.07s]  Let's see, what? We're gonna look at his- Who is it?
[9086.07s -> 9089.19s]  He rifles through his lord father's possessions. Who he's been writing to.
[9089.19s -> 9094.36s]  There is not much of any import there. Ledgers and administrative partment work.
[9094.36s -> 9100.60s]  Correspondence from Olympus, which he had ignored. No trace of any reference to his son.
[9100.60s -> 9111.22s]  But then, there is the note. The note.
[9111.22s -> 9116.42s]  Written finally in a hand and voice, the likes of which the prince had never seen or heard.
[9117.61s -> 9121.45s]  Hades, I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place.
[9121.45s -> 9124.49s]  Oh, it's from Persephone. So I'm leaving, even if it kills me.
[9124.49s -> 9129.96s]  I won't be returning to Olympus. If there is a place where I belong in this world,
[9130.68s -> 9133.16s]  it must be somewhere between heaven and hell.
[9133.16s -> 9136.26s]  Perhaps it's on the coast and has a little garden.
[9137.67s -> 9142.23s]  Take care of Cerberus. I shall miss him. Persephone.
[9143.64s -> 9144.14s]  Stephanie.
[9144.84s -> 9146.92s]  Thus did prince of the underworld-
[9146.92s -> 9148.60s]  I- I said that wrong all the time.
[9148.60s -> 9153.26s]  absorb the contents of this hidden letter, written in his mother's hand.
[9155.02s -> 9158.22s]  I think Steve rule. Persephone is Stephanie.
[9158.22s -> 9161.77s]  My name is Persephone. I sh- I should put you Stephanie, Stephanie.
[9165.90s -> 9169.42s]  You're saying this Persephone that she's my-
[9169.42s -> 9171.90s]  What? Oh, what the heck? No way!
[9171.90s -> 9173.82s]  I always said that Nyx was-
[9173.82s -> 9184.31s]  Persephone is Zagoras' mother, and Hades is Zagoras' father,
[9184.31s -> 9188.07s]  and he thought his mother was Nyx, and they've been keeping this secret from him forever.
[9188.07s -> 9191.45s]  Thus did the prince discover-
[9191.45s -> 9191.77s]  But why?
[9191.77s -> 9195.21s]  ...advertently the well-kept truth about his lineage.
[9196.01s -> 9200.73s]  Let me know in the comments what you think, why they're hiding that from Zagoras.
[9200.73s -> 9227.35s]  I'll see you next time for episode 145 of our playthrough of Hades.
[9227.35s -> 9228.15s]  Sinner, is he?
[9228.15s -> 9234.18s]  To find the wrong questions and his rage, the prince decided his lord and master.
[9234.18s -> 9236.02s]  145 streams of Hades.
[9240.25s -> 9240.75s]  Uh-oh.
[9242.25s -> 9244.65s]  Mommy, you've been lying to me this whole time.
[9247.90s -> 9250.86s]  Wait, or should I say, not mommy?
[9250.86s -> 9257.66s]  You, all this time, you and my father, you-
[9257.66s -> 9264.25s]  My dear child, so now you know.
[9265.46s -> 9266.26s]  So now you know.
[9267.06s -> 9269.22s]  But only half the truth.
[9269.22s -> 9275.48s]  I can explain the rest, so please, it never was my wish to hurt you.
[9275.48s -> 9276.04s]  Who cares?
[9292.34s -> 9295.14s]  I mean, you are my mother, who cares?
[9295.14s -> 9317.66s]  I kinda wanna-
[9317.66s -> 9324.47s]  This is too good to take off.
[9324.47s -> 9330.44s]  I'm never gonna be able to take this off ever again.
[9330.44s -> 9336.70s]  I like all this, but this one, I can die so many times.
[9337.42s -> 9339.34s]  This is 50% I get to die once.
[9339.90s -> 9342.39s]  Isn't this better?
[9343.03s -> 9356.79s]  Restore a small amount of health when you enter a chamber.
[9356.79s -> 9358.55s]  Three health when you go in a chamber versus-
[9359.83s -> 9362.23s]  No, no, no, no, I like this better.
[9362.23s -> 9363.43s]  I like it, I'm keeping it.
[9363.43s -> 9364.31s]  All right, let's go.
[9364.31s -> 9365.51s]  I don't have enough to do anything anyways.
[9369.48s -> 9371.24s]  You can die twice if you buy more of those.
[9371.24s -> 9374.12s]  Well, it's 600, that's a huge amount of-
[9374.12s -> 9383.16s]  So many of you are here to enjoy this game.
[9384.18s -> 9387.93s]  Thank you for being here each day.
[9387.93s -> 9403.13s]  I didn't say shit, that counts.
[9403.13s -> 9404.17s]  Whatever, 20 subs.
[9407.72s -> 9408.52s]  There's another-
[9408.52s -> 9409.56s]  There's another weapon?
[9412.84s -> 9413.96s]  I didn't know there was another-
[9413.96s -> 9415.56s]  Oh, I thought this was gonna be DLC.
[9422.22s -> 9423.94s]  There are two more weapons?
[9428.12s -> 9428.84s]  What?
[9428.84s -> 9430.12s]  It's a giant glove.
[9434.74s -> 9436.66s]  Oh, it's eight keys.
[9436.66s -> 9438.42s]  No, they're trying to keep me here forever.
[9448.71s -> 9451.67s]  All right, this is the next one you find will be from Dionysus.
[9451.67s -> 9455.82s]  All right, we're gonna go with the meta here.
[9459.46s -> 9460.34s]  And, hmm.
[9464.94s -> 9471.56s]  I am absolutely a shield guy.
[9472.20s -> 9482.47s]  I'm a shield guy.
[9482.47s -> 9498.68s]  Let's go.
[9498.68s -> 9499.48s]  Use bow?
[9499.48s -> 9500.12s]  Not yet.
[9500.12s -> 9502.50s]  All right, this is specifically what we're doing here is-
[9505.61s -> 9506.73s]  We're getting a cutscene?
[9511.72s -> 9523.58s]  Hold on, are you telling me that I almost beat the game before getting all the abilities
[9523.58s -> 9526.78s]  and before seeing the first, like, you're out of the tutorial cutscene?
[9526.78s -> 9531.94s]  Holy shit.
[9532.50s -> 9534.23s]  Wow, well, that's too bad.
[9534.79s -> 9541.11s]  It's just the edge I need.
[9541.11s -> 9542.95s]  Your dash drag deals 50%-
[9542.95s -> 9544.31s]  That's, okay, that's really good.
[9544.87s -> 9547.98s]  That's the bounce.
[9548.70s -> 9555.21s]  This charges up faster, but I'm going for the dash.
[9563.70s -> 9564.82s]  50% more damage.
[9570.95s -> 9571.91s]  Die Dallas hammer.
[9572.71s -> 9573.43s]  He doesn't know.
[9574.07s -> 9574.47s]  I-
[9574.47s -> 9575.27s]  No, I don't.
[9575.27s -> 9576.15s]  I don't know what you're referring to.
[9576.71s -> 9586.14s]  I'm absolutely a shield guy.
[9586.14s -> 9587.42s]  No, no doubt in my mind.
[9588.22s -> 9603.35s]  Chthonic coin-
[9603.35s -> 9604.07s]  What?
[9604.07s -> 9604.87s]  Chthonic coin-
[9604.87s -> 9605.51s]  Perth.
[9605.51s -> 9606.15s]  Received-
[9606.15s -> 9608.89s]  Oh, that's 125 now.
[9609.53s -> 9631.99s]  Play portal two?
[9631.99s -> 9634.23s]  No, it makes me throw up after 45 minutes and I have to stop.
[9645.59s -> 9647.03s]  Ooh, and Dionysus.
[9647.03s -> 9647.51s]  Here we go.
[9647.51s -> 9648.79s]  It's time for a bleed build.
[9652.62s -> 9658.63s]  It took me like two weeks to beat portal two when it first came out.
[9661.26s -> 9662.54s]  After 45 minutes, I have to stop.
[9664.06s -> 9668.01s]  Hangover damage.
[9668.01s -> 9668.41s]  Here we go.
[9670.81s -> 9672.25s]  That's probably the one I want.
[9672.25s -> 9674.22s]  Because that bounces around.
[9678.17s -> 9678.49s]  Why?
[9678.49s -> 9678.81s]  I don't know.
[9678.81s -> 9679.85s]  It's something about it.
[9679.85s -> 9685.03s]  Something about the falling through the portals and seeing the-
[9685.03s -> 9687.50s]  I don't know, it just fucks with my head and makes me sick.
[9687.50s -> 9689.14s]  Especially the first game.
[9689.70s -> 9699.35s]  Actually, one's probably better.
[9700.15s -> 9704.12s]  And we get chaos right off the bat.
[9704.12s -> 9705.64s]  This could be a pretty good run.
[9714.82s -> 9715.32s]  Ooh.
[9716.42s -> 9717.70s]  Wait, I gotta break the-
[9718.58s -> 9719.14s]  Okay, do I-
[9719.14s -> 9719.38s]  Is it-
[9719.38s -> 9721.50s]  Wait, I got a question.
[9721.50s -> 9722.06s]  Is the-
[9722.86s -> 9725.24s]  Should I just break every single vase now?
[9725.24s -> 9726.60s]  Or is it very specific?
[9726.60s -> 9728.04s]  It looks very different.
[9728.04s -> 9734.02s]  It's just gold pots.
[9734.02s -> 9734.82s]  Okay.
[9734.82s -> 9743.11s]  What artifact?
[9743.11s -> 9745.99s]  It is considered a defensive instrument, I do believe.
[9745.99s -> 9750.23s]  No ice defect you have discovered or soon shall discover.
[9750.23s -> 9751.59s]  It is nothing of the sort.
[9752.39s -> 9754.25s]  What is he talking about?
[9759.22s -> 9761.22s]  All right, for the next three encounters, you have-
[9761.22s -> 9762.02s]  That's awful.
[9762.74s -> 9767.22s]  Afterwards, boons have a 16% chance to be rare, but that's not very good.
[9769.53s -> 9770.97s]  Take 370%-
[9770.97s -> 9774.49s]  Okay, I die instantly from traps, but afterward I get 33 more max health.
[9775.80s -> 9780.81s]  Or each time you attack, get hit for 4 damage,
[9780.81s -> 9783.53s]  but any money you find is worth 35% more.
[9783.53s -> 9784.57s]  I'm just gonna kill myself.
[9785.13s -> 9790.33s]  How would I do this?
[9790.89s -> 9797.06s]  Would I have to kill everything with my cast or with a special?
[9798.02s -> 9799.14s]  Just use your special.
[9799.78s -> 9801.00s]  I'm gonna try it.
[9801.00s -> 9801.64s]  I'm going for it.
[9801.64s -> 9802.76s]  Let's see how this goes.
[9803.56s -> 9805.24s]  Because that's not an attack technically, right?
[9805.80s -> 9810.39s]  Does it get hurt?
[9811.03s -> 9821.43s]  All right, just play safe.
[9823.00s -> 9824.97s]  Just don't attack.
[9824.97s -> 9829.99s]  And look at this.
[9831.61s -> 9832.57s]  I hit the jackpot.
[9833.45s -> 9836.52s]  Free encounter.
[9836.52s -> 9840.92s]  Wait, fish?
[9840.92s -> 9841.88s]  What the hell?
[9841.88s -> 9848.41s]  I was trying to activate fish rod.
[9848.41s -> 9849.21s]  No fish?
[9849.21s -> 9864.39s]  Oh, this is gonna take a lot longer than I thought.
[9865.40s -> 9867.08s]  Oh boy, this is a bad idea, wasn't it?
[9872.52s -> 9873.02s]  Shit.
[9873.56s -> 9876.92s]  Come here.
[9877.46s -> 9892.95s]  Come on.
[9892.95s -> 9896.68s]  Kill that little shit.
[9897.40s -> 9911.19s]  That's not bad.
[9911.19s -> 9911.67s]  We're fine.
[9912.23s -> 9917.06s]  Aphrodite.
[9917.06s -> 9918.82s]  I haven't seen Aphrodite in a very long time.
[9918.82s -> 9920.34s]  But I can't do that one.
[9920.34s -> 9921.78s]  Wait, is the only door I can go in?
[9922.42s -> 9929.16s]  All right, plus 50% more damage on your special.
[9940.09s -> 9940.97s]  None of these will help me.
[9942.86s -> 9944.30s]  Gain plus one for your cast.
[9945.50s -> 9946.86s]  That's so much money though.
[9947.58s -> 9952.60s]  I have to take it.
[9953.40s -> 9955.56s]  Otherwise, I'm not gonna be able to complete this next encounter.
[9956.12s -> 9957.96s]  I physically won't be able to do it.
[9957.96s -> 9958.92s]  This is an elite room.
[9979.91s -> 9981.91s]  This motherfucker has all my cubes.
[9983.43s -> 9984.63s]  I'm so dead.
[9984.63s -> 9994.50s]  I'm so dead.
[9994.50s -> 9995.00s]  It's over.
[9995.70s -> 10006.33s]  Why did I have to get so greedy?
[10012.20s -> 10012.68s]  Block?
[10012.68s -> 10013.16s]  If I...
[10013.16s -> 10013.56s]  I can't...
[10016.60s -> 10017.08s]  All right, whatever.
[10017.08s -> 10017.10s]  Just...
[10017.96s -> 10020.60s]  I don't care.
[10020.60s -> 10023.48s]  Just restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart.
[10023.48s -> 10023.88s]  Why am I not...
[10023.88s -> 10024.76s]  Why am I still alive?
[10031.03s -> 10036.87s]  The curse can't kill you.
[10036.87s -> 10037.43s]  Yeah, that was...
[10038.39s -> 10038.87s]  That was over.
[10038.87s -> 10039.67s]  That's why it's called a doomsday.
[10039.67s -> 10040.55s]  Just rip the bandaid off.
[10040.55s -> 10041.05s]  Let's go.
[10055.42s -> 10058.86s]  Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[10059.50s -> 10060.54s]  That was very bad.
[10060.54s -> 10062.50s]  I'll redo that.
[10062.50s -> 10066.65s]  Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[10066.65s -> 10067.93s]  That was much better.
[10067.93s -> 10069.05s]  I had to give it some effort.
[10074.63s -> 10075.27s]  Still bad.
[10076.71s -> 10081.51s]  And that guy for life for saying that about me and my voice acting skills.
[10093.16s -> 10095.24s]  To say there isn't another death.
[10095.32s -> 10096.28s]  Another underworld.
[10096.92s -> 10100.76s]  I got his dad of old age.
[10100.76s -> 10101.48s]  What are you doing here?
[10104.25s -> 10104.65s]  Isn't like...
[10104.65s -> 10106.17s]  Isn't this supposed to be like serial killers?
[10106.73s -> 10108.70s]  I'm in hell?
[10109.50s -> 10111.06s]  That guy just died of old age.
[10111.06s -> 10111.30s]  He didn't...
[10111.30s -> 10112.34s]  What did he do?
[10112.34s -> 10121.90s]  What's new?
[10121.90s -> 10122.78s]  Hades is...
[10122.78s -> 10123.58s]  Oh, wait.
[10123.58s -> 10124.46s]  It's not heaven and hell?
[10127.34s -> 10128.30s]  What's hell in...
[10130.46s -> 10131.26s]  Greek mythology.
[10138.62s -> 10139.12s]  Tartarus.
[10141.90s -> 10142.40s]  Taurus.
[10143.58s -> 10144.08s]  Taurus.
[10155.13s -> 10157.05s]  Hades is a place and a person.
[10159.35s -> 10160.94s]  All right.
[10160.94s -> 10163.02s]  And serial killers not die from old age.
[10163.02s -> 10166.14s]  No, but wouldn't you think it would say like was a serial killer underneath it?
[10166.14s -> 10171.53s]  50%.
[10171.53s -> 10171.93s]  Let's go.
[10183.64s -> 10184.28s]  All right.
[10184.28s -> 10185.24s]  I got the shield still.
[10185.96s -> 10187.26s]  I want to unlock the glove.
[10195.90s -> 10199.75s]  There's other skellies?
[10201.59s -> 10209.54s]  Every time I get into a little string like this,
[10209.54s -> 10213.37s]  I just feel like I'm playing Smash Brothers.
[10213.37s -> 10214.33s]  Just like get in it.
[10223.38s -> 10224.18s]  Mash buttons.
[10224.18s -> 10225.30s]  It's not mashing buttons.
[10225.30s -> 10226.82s]  You do a string of things together.
[10226.82s -> 10227.14s]  You go...
[10228.02s -> 10233.35s]  I put this...
[10234.07s -> 10234.79s]  This is on, right?
[10234.79s -> 10236.23s]  Oh, this is even better that I restarted.
[10236.23s -> 10237.11s]  It's 125 gold.
[10237.67s -> 10239.93s]  Oh, he's dead now.
[10246.82s -> 10248.82s]  You mash them in the right order.
[10248.82s -> 10250.82s]  Aphrodite right off the bat.
[10250.82s -> 10253.62s]  And Aphrodite has not received a gift.
[10254.81s -> 10255.37s]  Take one.
[10255.85s -> 10261.11s]  Blessed simply to have made your acquaintance.
[10261.11s -> 10262.63s]  So this is for you.
[10262.63s -> 10268.12s]  Lasting relationships are built on reciprocity.
[10268.12s -> 10269.88s]  Given all my gifts to Aphrodite.
[10269.88s -> 10270.60s]  Gifts why?
[10270.60s -> 10272.81s]  What if I give you something in return?
[10278.47s -> 10279.35s]  Eternal rose.
[10279.99s -> 10288.34s]  Here is why Lord Hades would have kept your mere existence hidden from us all this time.
[10289.06s -> 10291.14s]  Perhaps he knew that once you met us...
[10291.14s -> 10292.98s]  Her icon looks the tastiest.
[10292.98s -> 10294.66s]  That's how I've been determining which one I want.
[10295.30s -> 10297.32s]  I feel like that one would taste the best.
[10298.12s -> 10298.76s]  The icon.
[10299.40s -> 10300.44s]  The icon.
[10300.44s -> 10301.80s]  The icon, folks.
[10301.80s -> 10302.36s]  The icon.
[10303.00s -> 10304.60s]  It's like a candy heart.
[10304.60s -> 10308.28s]  We have like crispy, cold, chilly, like spearmint gum.
[10309.18s -> 10312.62s]  We have like the wing, like the baby back ribs for Hermes.
[10312.62s -> 10314.78s]  I'm basing it on the icon.
[10315.34s -> 10315.58s]  Not?
[10316.22s -> 10317.02s]  Okay.
[10317.02s -> 10317.50s]  Relax.
[10318.14s -> 10321.66s]  Well, that's a good start.
[10323.16s -> 10324.36s]  That's also a good start.
[10331.88s -> 10332.84s]  I don't need to relax.
[10332.84s -> 10334.44s]  He wouldn't let me finish my sentence.
[10335.40s -> 10338.76s]  I'm like, oh, I base it on what I find looks the tastiest.
[10338.76s -> 10341.48s]  He's a sicko.
[10341.48s -> 10342.12s]  Icon.
[10342.12s -> 10342.92s]  He didn't let me finish.
[10345.19s -> 10345.75s]  Uh...
[10350.31s -> 10350.87s]  Death first.
[10354.30s -> 10355.42s]  44 damage already?
[10356.46s -> 10356.70s]  Sick.
[10363.22s -> 10368.86s]  All right, let's go.
[10368.86s -> 10369.50s]  Focus time.
[10371.83s -> 10373.59s]  And I like how there's little hearts after you do stuff.
[10374.23s -> 10389.16s]  Who's left?
[10389.16s -> 10390.12s]  Oh, there's nobody left.
[10394.25s -> 10398.17s]  Ooh, this is two good upgrades right in a row.
[10401.43s -> 10402.23s]  I can't even.
[10402.23s -> 10403.43s]  You guys are fucking crazy.
[10417.02s -> 10417.34s]  Bam.
[10425.14s -> 10426.50s]  Your attack hits twice.
[10429.05s -> 10429.61s]  I mean, it has.
[10438.01s -> 10439.37s]  Dude, you're looking like a snack.
[10442.42s -> 10442.90s]  Oh, me?
[10443.70s -> 10452.22s]  Yep.
[10452.22s -> 10453.66s]  That's good.
[10453.66s -> 10454.86s]  Go, boy.
[10456.06s -> 10456.62s]  I'm sorry.
[10456.62s -> 10457.50s]  That was very bad.
[10459.72s -> 10463.40s]  I may have just been trying to do like a hillbilly voice.
[10469.75s -> 10470.55s]  Oh, bad.
[10471.11s -> 10471.99s]  That's good.
[10471.99s -> 10472.47s]  I can't even.
[10472.47s -> 10473.59s]  You can't even do that.
[10473.59s -> 10479.86s]  I forgot an urn?
[10479.86s -> 10480.10s]  What?
[10480.10s -> 10481.06s]  I didn't even know what they were.
[10481.06s -> 10481.70s]  What does it look like?
[10481.70s -> 10482.34s]  I missed out.
[10482.82s -> 10484.66s]  Oh, he's stupid.
[10484.66s -> 10484.98s]  He's stupid.
[10484.98s -> 10485.38s]  He's dumb.
[10485.38s -> 10486.26s]  Don't let him forget it.
[10486.90s -> 10500.02s]  Give me more.
[10500.02s -> 10521.32s]  It's going to be just like the certain thing in a certain game
[10521.32s -> 10523.56s]  that shows up that I miss all the time.
[10523.56s -> 10526.92s]  And it's something in this certain thing that I will not make a reference to.
[10529.21s -> 10530.89s]  And it shows up in some rooms.
[10531.99s -> 10534.55s]  And it's differently colored.
[10535.35s -> 10538.71s]  And it's hard for me to see them sometimes.
[10545.22s -> 10545.86s]  I don't.
[10545.86s -> 10546.34s]  I want the.
[10546.98s -> 10549.51s]  Why is it?
[10549.51s -> 10551.64s]  I want the heart.
[10551.64s -> 10553.72s]  Don't keep me going.
[10554.50s -> 10556.58s]  Dash deals damage when you end up inflicting weak.
[10557.30s -> 10560.02s]  Weak afflicted foes are also more susceptible to damage.
[10563.10s -> 10564.06s]  I mean, it should be.
[10564.06s -> 10564.54s]  It's two.
[10565.18s -> 10577.94s]  Does that say 35 unmarried is embarrassed by his job?
[10577.94s -> 10579.06s]  Physically deformed.
[10579.70s -> 10586.54s]  What did I have?
[10586.54s -> 10587.90s]  What did I do to you, man?
[10587.90s -> 10590.22s]  If I provided you with, say, a thousand coins,
[10590.22s -> 10592.86s]  would you be willing to give me a ride in your beautiful boat?
[10592.86s -> 10595.32s]  Or I should say specifically.
[10595.32s -> 10597.86s]  What did I do to you?
[10601.61s -> 10605.05s]  That's like I just gave you two seconds to scream at me.
[10606.38s -> 10607.34s]  You got to get it all out.
[10610.70s -> 10611.74s]  Another Aphrodite door.
[10621.59s -> 10622.63s]  Actually ban that guy.
[10622.63s -> 10623.35s]  That was rude.
[10626.68s -> 10627.24s]  I can't.
[10627.96s -> 10628.44s]  I can't.
[10629.24s -> 10631.08s]  I mean, he's wicked mean.
[10631.08s -> 10634.44s]  But I can't ban everybody.
[10635.16s -> 10644.39s]  Alicia, this is a great build.
[10653.48s -> 10663.70s]  It's just revenge damage.
[10663.70s -> 10665.83s]  But when you.
[10666.55s -> 10667.35s]  Definitely two.
[10667.35s -> 10668.07s]  Yeah, they blow up.
[10668.71s -> 10676.58s]  Remember, don't let anybody shame you for your life.
[10676.58s -> 10676.90s]  All right.
[10676.90s -> 10677.70s]  Let me be honest.
[10678.18s -> 10679.70s]  Let's break that down for a second.
[10681.46s -> 10682.66s]  Yeah, I'm 35.
[10682.66s -> 10683.22s]  Who cares?
[10683.94s -> 10686.42s]  You just get age gets better with wine.
[10686.42s -> 10689.46s]  Except in my case, when you have spinal disc problems,
[10689.46s -> 10691.14s]  you have a hernia that needs surgery,
[10691.14s -> 10694.42s]  and you need to take baths every day.
[10694.42s -> 10694.74s]  All right.
[10694.74s -> 10696.04s]  Hey, how dare you?
[10696.04s -> 10700.62s]  Second of all, unmarried.
[10700.62s -> 10701.82s]  What if I don't want to get married?
[10701.82s -> 10703.18s]  What if I want to be complete?
[10703.18s -> 10705.75s]  What if I just want to live for me, man?
[10705.75s -> 10706.55s]  OK, number three.
[10708.46s -> 10709.18s]  What was third one?
[10715.82s -> 10719.66s]  He's balding so hard that I was physically.
[10720.30s -> 10720.70s]  All right.
[10725.91s -> 10727.83s]  Let me play my fucking computer game.
[10728.55s -> 10730.15s]  Let me play my computer game.
[10730.87s -> 10753.16s]  Dude, this triple hit.
[10753.16s -> 10759.70s]  Look at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1,000.
[10759.70s -> 10760.74s]  Give me some synergy here.
[10760.74s -> 10761.22s]  Come on.
[10761.22s -> 10762.10s]  Crystal thing.
[10762.10s -> 10763.54s]  Give me some synergy here, please.
[10763.54s -> 10770.52s]  Synergy since you began your quest.
[10770.52s -> 10770.92s]  It's cool.
[10770.92s -> 10771.48s]  You have.
[10771.48s -> 10772.60s]  I'm keeping count.
[10772.60s -> 10774.33s]  Most impressed.
[10774.33s -> 10778.02s]  Everyone's going to marry his computer.
[10778.66s -> 10783.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[10784.66s -> 10785.30s]  There it is.
[10788.57s -> 10789.61s]  There it is.
[10789.61s -> 10799.58s]  Who cares about Blade Rift when I can just go like this
[10799.58s -> 10800.86s]  and they take a shitload of damage.
[10802.84s -> 10804.12s]  Get VR married.
[10806.68s -> 10812.44s]  You know, I'm surprised there is not a VR get married simulator by now.
[10812.44s -> 10815.32s]  Where you're the groom and the bride comes down the aisle
[10815.32s -> 10818.52s]  and you exchange vows and stuff.
[10818.52s -> 10819.24s]  There is.
[10819.24s -> 10821.70s]  Well, then I'm going to play it.
[10821.70s -> 10822.58s]  I have to play that.
[10822.58s -> 10824.42s]  I have to play the get married simulator.
[10831.00s -> 10833.32s]  Sima Shanzi just gave 10 community subs.
[10833.32s -> 10834.20s]  Thank you, Sima.
[10834.28s -> 10837.77s]  Appreciate the subs.
[10837.77s -> 10838.89s]  10 subs just dropped in.
[10839.53s -> 10849.45s]  What happened to me?
[10849.45s -> 10850.25s]  Oh, that's his move.
[10850.81s -> 10852.09s]  Yeah, dude.
[10852.09s -> 10854.57s]  This shit is a get in and get out move set.
[10854.57s -> 10855.21s]  Get in.
[10855.21s -> 10855.61s]  Get out.
[10856.57s -> 10856.97s]  Get in.
[10856.97s -> 10857.45s]  Get out.
[10857.45s -> 10857.77s]  Get in.
[10857.77s -> 10858.57s]  Get out.
[10858.57s -> 10859.05s]  Get in.
[10859.05s -> 10859.77s]  Get out.
[10859.77s -> 10860.17s]  Get in.
[10860.97s -> 10862.22s]  Get out.
[10864.01s -> 10864.25s]  Get in.
[10864.25s -> 10864.57s]  Get out.
[10865.29s -> 10865.69s]  Get out.
[10866.41s -> 10876.26s]  Pomegranate.
[10876.26s -> 10878.73s]  What?
[10878.73s -> 10879.45s]  I missed another.
[10884.01s -> 10890.33s]  In and out.
[10890.33s -> 10891.13s]  Animal style.
[10892.84s -> 10894.28s]  I'm missing so many things.
[10898.31s -> 10898.71s]  Fishing.
[10900.09s -> 10901.29s]  I don't let me miss that.
[10902.41s -> 10904.65s]  I want 1,000 people to unsub if I do not.
[10904.65s -> 10905.37s]  If I miss that.
[10924.26s -> 10926.10s]  Imagine not being shield guy.
[10926.10s -> 10930.76s]  Imagine thinking anything else in this game was as adequate as shield guy is.
[10930.76s -> 10932.84s]  Power.
[10932.84s -> 10933.88s]  Delicious.
[10933.88s -> 10935.24s]  Oh, yes.
[10941.32s -> 10941.96s]  94%.
[10945.91s -> 10946.63s]  Pogged out.
[10946.63s -> 10947.75s]  I'm pogged out too, man.
[10947.75s -> 10949.35s]  I can only pog so many times.
[10950.15s -> 10950.65s]  Fish.
[10956.33s -> 10956.83s]  Knucklehead?
[10958.58s -> 10959.62s]  I got a perfect catch.
[10966.54s -> 10967.04s]  Oh.
[10967.12s -> 10971.87s]  Of Charon's ways.
[10971.87s -> 10973.55s]  Um, should I just take that?
[10973.55s -> 10974.35s]  No, not worth it.
[10975.31s -> 10979.90s]  I need to get him from here.
[10981.42s -> 10983.71s]  All right, well now at least I know what that looks like.
[10984.51s -> 10996.35s]  In and out style.
[11004.73s -> 11005.87s]  I love it.
[11005.87s -> 11006.83s]  I love this shield.
[11006.83s -> 11007.71s]  It's the best weapon.
[11008.51s -> 11011.72s]  I don't think glove can compare.
[11011.72s -> 11012.28s]  I really don't.
[11024.19s -> 11025.15s]  I'm just cleaning up.
[11029.37s -> 11030.09s]  Do you see any fish?
[11030.65s -> 11031.77s]  I don't see any fish.
[11032.49s -> 11035.93s]  Is Greek mythology pog or not pog?
[11035.93s -> 11037.05s]  It's pog.
[11037.05s -> 11037.93s]  It's really pog, actually.
[11037.93s -> 11040.49s]  Come forth, wretches, and stop this meddler.
[11042.81s -> 11044.17s]  Survive for 45 seconds.
[11044.17s -> 11045.21s]  Their attention.
[11045.21s -> 11055.47s]  You got more than that?
[11056.11s -> 11058.00s]  I'm talking about a shield user.
[11090.14s -> 11091.66s]  No, I don't think so.
[11092.62s -> 11094.94s]  I should not be the supervisor here.
[11094.94s -> 11095.98s]  Well, that's better.
[11095.98s -> 11099.58s]  How many keys do I have?
[11100.30s -> 11100.80s]  Three.
[11101.26s -> 11117.77s]  I'm just hamstringing myself for no reason
[11117.77s -> 11118.97s]  because I just leave the...
[11118.97s -> 11119.45s]  I just go.
[11119.45s -> 11120.17s]  I'm like, let's go.
[11120.17s -> 11120.81s]  I'm ready.
[11120.81s -> 11129.61s]  You need to relax.
[11129.61s -> 11131.05s]  I am very relaxed.
[11131.05s -> 11131.85s]  I just want...
[11131.85s -> 11133.13s]  I'm ready to open the door.
[11136.01s -> 11136.51s]  Uh...
[11137.47s -> 11140.78s]  No, no, no.
[11143.42s -> 11144.62s]  I'm so mad.
[11144.62s -> 11145.66s]  He's defeated.
[11145.66s -> 11154.02s]  I mean, but I just got a little happier right here.
[11154.82s -> 11162.62s]  Your call fires a seeking arrow with a 35% crit chance.
[11163.26s -> 11169.82s]  The arrows do 120 damage, and it fires 10 arrows
[11169.82s -> 11175.09s]  if you let it fill all the way, which would be
[11175.97s -> 11180.05s]  just base 1200 damage with a 35% crit.
[11181.86s -> 11182.82s]  If even two...
[11182.82s -> 11185.06s]  If even one of those crits, which you would assume
[11185.06s -> 11188.42s]  that statistically three out of three and a half of them will
[11190.35s -> 11191.87s]  talk about like 1500 damage.
[11192.90s -> 11193.94s]  1600 damage, maybe.
[11198.08s -> 11199.04s]  Let's hunt some dead.
[11201.22s -> 11202.42s]  I'm gonna fill the bar.
[11215.89s -> 11218.37s]  I'm gonna take a pee break after this and get some water.
[11219.01s -> 11221.54s]  Crit is 3x.
[11222.93s -> 11224.45s]  Give up already, Zach.
[11224.45s -> 11225.33s]  Was that a sneeze?
[11226.05s -> 11226.55s]  Bless you.
[11227.33s -> 11231.76s]  I have some bad news for you, Meg.
[11231.76s -> 11234.16s]  Little by little, I'm getting stronger.
[11234.16s -> 11237.54s]  Aren't I killing her over and over again?
[11237.54s -> 11239.54s]  She's talking like she's killing me over and over again.
[11245.42s -> 11247.62s]  He's got this kind of backwards, I think.
[11248.18s -> 11255.31s]  Look at that damage.
[11265.15s -> 11266.11s]  Already sick.
[11266.75s -> 11273.02s]  Look at cocky.
[11288.40s -> 11289.92s]  Oh, I was trying to stay in the middle.
[11292.40s -> 11295.78s]  You just call that an airstrike?
[11296.50s -> 11300.38s]  Our UAV is online.
[11301.02s -> 11302.30s]  Our UAV is airborne.
[11303.02s -> 11320.58s]  Excuse me.
[11321.46s -> 11324.42s]  Watch out for the guy behind you.
[11335.94s -> 11337.22s]  Get the fuck out of here, Meg.
[11342.42s -> 11342.92s]  Yes.
[11344.26s -> 11346.46s]  50, that's a lot.
[11347.58s -> 11357.22s]  Anybody see anything?
[11357.22s -> 11359.65s]  A paranoid to open the door.
[11359.65s -> 11372.61s]  Go get water and pee.
[11372.61s -> 11373.57s]  Yeah, I will in a second.
[11373.57s -> 11375.06s]  Well, I don't even need to.
[11381.78s -> 11382.50s]  Doesn't even do anything.
[11383.22s -> 11386.14s]  Full health already.
[11386.14s -> 11390.14s]  Here comes a family guy funny hell moment.
[11390.78s -> 11397.33s]  Wait, what is this?
[11397.33s -> 11399.81s]  Oh, it's just you getting Aphrodite gives you this thing.
[11409.81s -> 11411.57s]  I have the money, so I'm just gonna buy it.
[11412.21s -> 11417.23s]  All right, bear it back.
[11417.23s -> 11419.18s]  I'm just gonna pee and grab a water.
[11419.18s -> 11420.30s]  I'll be back in like two, three minutes.
[11423.15s -> 11428.43s]  Fucking hate streaming.
[11428.43s -> 11429.57s]  Fucking I'm so done.
[11429.57s -> 11431.09s]  I'm fucking never streaming again.
[11431.65s -> 11433.82s]  Like after tonight, it's fucking I'm done streaming.
[11744.90s -> 11745.38s]  I'm here.
[11745.38s -> 11745.70s]  I'm here.
[11745.70s -> 11746.98s]  I'm just, I'm eating.
[11762.64s -> 11764.80s]  Now, you know, I've been into these new streamer snacks.
[11768.32s -> 11771.87s]  These little turkey jerkeys.
[11771.87s -> 11778.05s]  They like Slim Jims, but they're not full of trash.
[11778.61s -> 11779.41s]  I guess you could say.
[11781.74s -> 11785.63s]  And this is coming from somebody that I love Slim Jims.
[11785.63s -> 11786.35s]  I do.
[11786.35s -> 11788.48s]  But they are dog shit.
[11788.48s -> 11797.28s]  Did you guys know that if you ate, if you ate 1600 Slim Jims in a row, you die?
[11797.28s -> 11804.30s]  Did you know that?
[11804.30s -> 11806.94s]  1400 Slim Jims, actually.
[11806.94s -> 11810.78s]  If you eat 1400 Slim Jims, you will die.
[11811.82s -> 11815.50s]  Because of the sodium nitrate in Slim Jims.
[11822.91s -> 11824.27s]  That's so fucking funny.
[11824.83s -> 11827.30s]  Just eat, yeah, just eat the thousand of them.
[11827.30s -> 11828.26s]  You'll be all right.
[11828.34s -> 11851.41s]  Okay, if you type in how many Slim Jims kill you into Google, you get a IGN forum of somebody
[11851.41s -> 11856.05s]  saying being very concerned that they ate 15 Slim Jims and they're concerned.
[11857.95s -> 11860.59s]  My mouth and throat are coated in grease.
[11862.51s -> 11867.07s]  Or whatever that orange slimy goo is that oozes out when you squeeze a Slim Jim.
[11867.07s -> 11868.35s]  I feel so gross right now.
[11868.35s -> 11871.38s]  And I think I'm having chest pains.
[11871.38s -> 11872.34s]  What the fuck?
[11878.78s -> 11882.08s]  20, like 2013, 2014.
[11882.08s -> 11883.04s]  Holy shit.
[11892.90s -> 11898.80s]  Okay, I don't, it's not, I'm not talking about me.
[11898.80s -> 11901.44s]  I'm not talking, I didn't just eat 15 Slim Jims.
[11902.08s -> 11911.22s]  I had these, they're organic turkey jerkies.
[11912.02s -> 11914.50s]  And they're completely and totally good.
[11914.50s -> 11915.70s]  No bullshit.
[11915.70s -> 11916.58s]  No crap at it.
[11916.58s -> 11920.06s]  It's just like turkey smoked, smoked turkey links.
[11920.06s -> 11920.54s]  And that's it.
[11920.54s -> 11921.26s]  And there's nothing else.
[11921.26s -> 11923.02s]  And they're little and I can have them on the street.
[11923.02s -> 11924.86s]  Look, I don't eat, I eat Slim Jims.
[11925.42s -> 11927.26s]  Once every like five years.
[11927.26s -> 11932.05s]  Slim Jims are fine.
[11932.05s -> 11932.69s]  They're good.
[11932.69s -> 11933.41s]  They're delicious.
[11933.41s -> 11934.45s]  They taste good.
[11934.45s -> 11936.37s]  Just don't eat more than 10 of them in a row.
[11938.64s -> 11942.40s]  Don't eat 1,400 at the same time because it'll give you, it'll kill you, apparently.
[11942.40s -> 11947.82s]  By the way, if you eat 1,400 of anything at the same time, it's gonna, you'll die.
[11947.82s -> 11948.86s]  You're gonna die.
[11948.86s -> 11953.04s]  You could eat 1,400 bags of kale and you're dead.
[11953.04s -> 11960.58s]  You could eat 1,400 grams of salt.
[11961.62s -> 11965.38s]  Yeah, any 1,400 of anything will kill you.
[11965.38s -> 11970.69s]  1,400 pieces of rice.
[11971.25s -> 11983.46s]  That's true.
[11983.46s -> 11984.51s]  You're right.
[11984.51s -> 11985.79s]  But actually, that's a lot though.
[11986.35s -> 11988.51s]  How much, wait, how much, how much rice is in a bag of rice?
[11993.87s -> 11996.27s]  How many grains of rice are in a bag?
[11996.27s -> 11999.52s]  Probably not that many.
[12004.21s -> 12006.21s]  One pound of rice is 7,000 grains.
[12007.22s -> 12007.94s]  All right, well, there you go.
[12007.94s -> 12010.82s]  You could eat 1,400 rice pellets and be fine.
[12013.70s -> 12014.26s]  Going up.
[12014.90s -> 12017.26s]  All right, let's go.
[12018.45s -> 12019.01s]  Let's do it.
[12019.81s -> 12020.69s]  I have a good build.
[12020.69s -> 12023.97s]  We're gonna, we're gonna totally own this.
[12023.97s -> 12027.87s]  Change of scenery at least.
[12027.87s -> 12032.61s]  What are we, what about, I'm not gonna say that.
[12035.39s -> 12036.59s]  Pomegranate, perfect.
[12046.59s -> 12047.15s]  Looks big.
[12048.11s -> 12049.41s]  Look bigger than usual.
[12050.29s -> 12051.97s]  Don't, no jokes, play.
[12052.77s -> 12053.97s]  Trying to beat the game tonight.
[12055.95s -> 12058.03s]  Don't make like a funny remark.
[12058.03s -> 12058.51s]  Oh, funny.
[12062.43s -> 12063.31s]  Idiot.
[12063.31s -> 12065.63s]  Oh, by the way, when I was downstairs, I was getting the jerky.
[12065.63s -> 12068.59s]  I started laughing about like the 35-year-old like meme guy.
[12069.31s -> 12072.96s]  I just like thought about his sentence.
[12072.96s -> 12075.36s]  I was like, holy shit, that was like so fucking mean.
[12076.40s -> 12083.74s]  I wonder if that person's still here.
[12095.57s -> 12096.37s]  There it is again.
[12097.09s -> 12098.13s]  Attack damage.
[12101.20s -> 12112.19s]  Or, no, so, or, no, that's 14%.
[12112.19s -> 12113.15s]  That, no, no, no, this is better.
[12113.15s -> 12125.44s]  This is straight up better than this one.
[12125.44s -> 12130.96s]  I could get, yes, Hermes is gonna bail us out here.
[12131.60s -> 12142.72s]  We're gonna get bailed out by Hermes.
[12142.72s -> 12145.76s]  He's gonna give us like 30% faster attack speed or something crazy.
[12145.76s -> 12147.28s]  We're gonna get like a legendary from him.
[12147.28s -> 12147.76s]  Can't wait.
[12148.72s -> 12156.91s]  I don't even have, I don't even have a cast yet.
[12156.99s -> 12158.67s]  All right, we gotta, I gotta figure that out.
[12158.67s -> 12159.55s]  We don't have, there's no cast.
[12168.08s -> 12168.80s]  Oh, shit.
[12182.42s -> 12187.74s]  Taking way too much damage right now and I'm not happy about it.
[12187.74s -> 12189.10s]  Please play something else so I can watch.
[12189.10s -> 12190.22s]  I don't want spoilers.
[12191.34s -> 12195.58s]  Um, shit, what do we do?
[12198.62s -> 12199.18s]  I don't know, man.
[12199.18s -> 12199.74s]  I don't know what to do.
[12200.62s -> 12208.19s]  It's too good to not take every time.
[12213.07s -> 12214.96s]  That's very good.
[12216.38s -> 12221.60s]  For 10 seconds, but I just always dash.
[12225.49s -> 12226.21s]  Always dash.
[12226.21s -> 12227.01s]  It's always dash.
[12227.01s -> 12227.73s]  It is every time.
[12232.54s -> 12235.74s]  Don't have enough money to do much in the shop.
[12235.74s -> 12244.06s]  So I'm gonna go hard mode and get more Aphrodite bonus combo duo double barbecue bacon bunker burger.
[12244.78s -> 12253.02s]  All right, Aphrodite.
[12253.02s -> 12262.42s]  What is it now?
[12266.22s -> 12267.90s]  Your weak effects are more potent.
[12267.90s -> 12269.74s]  Weak damage reduction 10%.
[12269.74s -> 12272.06s]  Victim deals at least 30.
[12272.06s -> 12273.82s]  It's gonna be 40% less damage now.
[12274.30s -> 12283.12s]  But, uh, am I just gonna be a one-button Barry?
[12283.76s -> 12289.62s]  I guess so.
[12295.90s -> 12297.81s]  I forgot you were in the game.
[12297.81s -> 12298.45s]  It's been a while.
[12302.45s -> 12313.28s]  Get away.
[12324.02s -> 12325.54s]  Oh, that's the thing that hits me.
[12325.54s -> 12326.42s]  Are you really hitting me?
[12327.06s -> 12345.20s]  Come on, just bully this guy.
[12345.20s -> 12361.74s]  One shot.
[12365.98s -> 12366.62s]  There it is.
[12369.66s -> 12371.42s]  Your health, your health, your health.
[12371.42s -> 12371.92s]  Cry.
[12377.63s -> 12378.13s]  Cry?
[12378.83s -> 12379.95s]  Why are you saying the cry?
[12379.95s -> 12380.99s]  You guys are crazed.
[12389.33s -> 12389.83s]  Only 2%.
[12395.23s -> 12395.79s]  Damn it.
[12395.79s -> 12398.43s]  Now I kind of wish I took the special from the last one.
[12399.15s -> 12401.65s]  This can be upgraded though, right?
[12414.11s -> 12415.39s]  That can be upgraded.
[12415.39s -> 12416.43s]  Probably like 5% or 6%.
[12422.08s -> 12423.04s]  This is interesting.
[12425.55s -> 12426.75s]  I need to take the health, I think.
[12427.79s -> 12428.51s]  It's getting bad.
[12431.73s -> 12432.93s]  Well, thank you.
[12433.49s -> 12437.92s]  How much more jerky do I have?
[12440.78s -> 12441.90s]  I want extra jerky.
[12444.50s -> 12446.02s]  Did I see the Power Stone news?
[12446.58s -> 12449.54s]  I did not.
[12451.52s -> 12453.12s]  What would do better with this build?
[12453.12s -> 12454.72s]  Ares or Dionysus?
[12459.79s -> 12460.75s]  Probably Ares.
[12460.75s -> 12463.55s]  Hope I can do it.
[12463.55s -> 12469.65s]  Wait, I don't get my ass kicked.
[12475.76s -> 12476.80s]  Oh, God.
[12476.80s -> 12477.44s]  This is not good.
[12482.11s -> 12484.26s]  Not good.
[12484.26s -> 12484.66s]  Not good.
[12492.77s -> 12493.65s]  Holy shit.
[12502.19s -> 12503.47s]  Come on, get over here so I don't...
[12506.86s -> 12507.58s]  Get closer.
[12507.58s -> 12508.54s]  Even closer than that, please.
[12509.76s -> 12510.64s]  Closer than that, please.
[12511.38s -> 12512.34s]  Get closer than that.
[12512.34s -> 12512.82s]  I can't hit...
[12513.54s -> 12522.83s]  I don't want to die here.
[12532.30s -> 12532.80s]  Yes.
[12533.82s -> 12534.54s]  Didn't die.
[12534.54s -> 12535.87s]  Coachcraft, what can you do?
[12545.92s -> 12549.95s]  Three is, I mean...
[12550.51s -> 12554.21s]  Does that include bosses?
[12554.21s -> 12555.01s]  And does it stack?
[12559.58s -> 12562.14s]  Capcom's making a new Power Stone game?
[12566.67s -> 12569.79s]  Then that's what I want.
[12569.79s -> 12573.15s]  The act of sorcery often ends in an untimely death.
[12573.15s -> 12574.19s]  That's pretty awesome.
[12574.19s -> 12574.91s]  Took him long enough.
[12574.91s -> 12576.67s]  I took him like 25 years to do that.
[12576.67s -> 12579.07s]  So some are able to perfect the trade.
[12579.07s -> 12581.39s]  And take up permanent residence elsewhere.
[12582.19s -> 12589.06s]  I'm sure the witch's circle will reconvene soon enough.
[12589.06s -> 12591.70s]  Anybody see an urn that I can break or something?
[12595.17s -> 12597.73s]  Or health or treasure or anything?
[12598.45s -> 12606.21s]  Tell you something funny, funny man.
[12608.85s -> 12609.35s]  No.
[12610.10s -> 12610.60s]  No.
[12611.90s -> 12612.54s]  Huh.
[12612.54s -> 12618.06s]  That was a slow one.
[12618.06s -> 12622.14s]  That was like a I'm just pressing it down and letting it go because you told me to.
[12622.14s -> 12624.37s]  Must be Uridice.
[12629.66s -> 12630.22s]  Oh, okay.
[12630.22s -> 12631.10s]  This is good.
[12631.10s -> 12638.18s]  I can upgrade the crit one maybe.
[12638.82s -> 12643.14s]  Uridice, how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts?
[12643.70s -> 12645.78s]  Has it been magma flooded like this all the time?
[12647.84s -> 12649.28s]  Say something unfunny now.
[12649.84s -> 12652.40s]  No, you got your one guy moment.
[12652.40s -> 12653.28s]  You're not getting another one.
[12654.08s -> 12655.12s]  The searing heat?
[12656.08s -> 12658.82s]  I'm dead, your royal majesty.
[12658.82s -> 12660.98s]  Searing is just a cooking technique to me.
[12660.98s -> 12662.26s]  Don't need to sleep either.
[12662.26s -> 12664.34s]  I can just keep cooking up a storm.
[12664.34s -> 12665.30s]  It's not so bad.
[12673.30s -> 12676.02s]  Love up to four random boons get a level.
[12677.42s -> 12680.62s]  Two random boons are upgraded to the next rarity.
[12680.62s -> 12684.11s]  We just have to pray that it's...
[12684.11s -> 12684.67s]  Wait a minute.
[12684.67s -> 12685.47s]  I only have two.
[12686.27s -> 12690.19s]  I only have two boons.
[12698.13s -> 12699.09s]  I have five?
[12699.09s -> 12699.57s]  I do?
[12699.57s -> 12701.01s]  Look it on the left side of the screen though.
[12701.01s -> 12701.97s]  I don't know I only have two?
[12710.32s -> 12712.48s]  Up to two could mean just one.
[12714.08s -> 12715.04s]  You have eight.
[12715.68s -> 12727.70s]  Okay, it's either that one or I level it up.
[12728.26s -> 12730.06s]  I'm going for it.
[12730.06s -> 12731.50s]  Two random boons get upgraded.
[12732.38s -> 12736.98s]  One, two, three.
[12740.96s -> 12742.00s]  They get it?
[12742.00s -> 12743.12s]  One of those is legendary.
[12749.09s -> 12750.69s]  Oh, that's crazy.
[12751.41s -> 12751.91s]  What?
[12757.26s -> 12759.98s]  But that's good though.
[12759.98s -> 12760.62s]  That's good.
[12771.52s -> 12772.24s]  That's good.
[12772.24s -> 12773.04s]  I need health though.
[12773.76s -> 12777.09s]  It's straight up more damage across the board.
[12777.09s -> 12777.89s]  Yeah, that was worth it.
[12779.09s -> 12779.81s]  Good dice roll.
[12781.68s -> 12782.16s]  No health.
[12782.16s -> 12785.98s]  I have to be so careful.
[12785.98s -> 12786.38s]  All right.
[12786.38s -> 12787.34s]  Don't blow this.
[12787.98s -> 12789.18s]  I'm going to get some health right here.
[12791.95s -> 12796.94s]  All right, let's go.
[12799.86s -> 12818.80s]  Whoa.
[12818.80s -> 12821.09s]  Burn.
[12821.09s -> 12821.49s]  Burn him.
[12821.49s -> 12821.99s]  Burn him.
[12823.68s -> 12824.18s]  Burn.
[12824.72s -> 12825.60s]  Burn this thing.
[12826.24s -> 12841.39s]  Get out of the fire.
[12841.39s -> 12841.95s]  I can't hurt you.
[12842.91s -> 12843.41s]  Whoa.
[12856.10s -> 12856.74s]  Wowee.
[12857.70s -> 12858.20s]  Wowee.
[12864.86s -> 12865.36s]  Wow.
[12872.67s -> 12873.17s]  Wow.
[12873.73s -> 12877.51s]  Kill these little shits.
[12878.39s -> 12901.44s]  Didn't even take a single lick of damage.
[12901.44s -> 12904.55s]  I mean, at this point, I think I have to hope for health in the shop.
[12905.11s -> 12918.42s]  Pomegranate's good, but I need to be sure.
[12919.88s -> 12921.86s]  And nice work.
[12922.50s -> 12923.78s]  Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[12924.42s -> 12925.97s]  That's very good.
[12926.69s -> 12927.94s]  I'll take it.
[12928.50s -> 12931.57s]  Time for the boss.
[12932.29s -> 12942.55s]  I wish I could afford all this, but I can't.
[12943.19s -> 12946.39s]  75 health is not good for where I am in the game right now.
[12947.03s -> 12949.72s]  It really isn't.
[12950.36s -> 12955.14s]  I need like 100 plus.
[12957.20s -> 12958.40s]  Use the call at maximum.
[12958.96s -> 12960.00s]  I'm going to try to this time.
[12971.27s -> 12973.03s]  I still don't have a cast.
[12975.04s -> 12983.81s]  This is absolutely mutilating though.
[12984.53s -> 12992.74s]  We just got a bully.
[12992.74s -> 12994.50s]  We got a bully the second they come up.
[12994.50s -> 12999.27s]  It's bully.
[13014.82s -> 13015.78s]  Absolute bully.
[13015.78s -> 13032.84s]  Careful.
[13032.84s -> 13033.64s]  He's different.
[13033.64s -> 13034.36s]  You notice that?
[13034.36s -> 13036.12s]  He's like got different stuff.
[13036.12s -> 13039.40s]  What's going on?
[13039.40s -> 13040.52s]  Why is he back there like that?
[13040.52s -> 13041.02s]  Come on.
[13041.72s -> 13052.12s]  Jesus.
[13052.58s -> 13053.14s]  Don't use it yet.
[13053.14s -> 13053.64s]  Don't use it.
[13054.26s -> 13074.18s]  Don't use it yet.
[13074.18s -> 13075.14s]  No, don't use it.
[13075.14s -> 13085.36s]  All right, now use it now.
[13085.76s -> 13086.16s]  Watch this.
[13086.16s -> 13087.60s]  I'm going to kill them one shot.
[13088.24s -> 13101.19s]  Goodbye.
[13101.19s -> 13102.39s]  Something for the mirror.
[13102.39s -> 13108.71s]  And it's full health.
[13108.71s -> 13110.31s]  So what did we learn today?
[13111.11s -> 13118.10s]  We learned that during a boss fight, no matter what,
[13118.10s -> 13122.69s]  wait until you are at full.
[13122.69s -> 13125.86s]  So my idea here is when we get to Hades,
[13126.98s -> 13131.48s]  don't even use it during the entire first encounter.
[13131.48s -> 13135.24s]  Once the second encounter goes through, kill Hades in one shot.
[13135.24s -> 13140.36s]  Once I get through phase one.
[13141.99s -> 13143.11s]  That should be.
[13143.11s -> 13144.31s]  This should be.
[13144.31s -> 13145.59s]  And I put that in quotes.
[13145.59s -> 13146.47s]  This should be the one.
[13159.70s -> 13160.20s]  We'll see.
[13172.77s -> 13173.65s]  I'll save my money.
[13174.69s -> 13177.25s]  The money needs to be saved because we're at the last area.
[13182.37s -> 13185.88s]  Make sure you hold it.
[13185.88s -> 13187.56s]  Wait a second so you don't waste it on iframes.
[13188.20s -> 13190.04s]  Yeah, that's why I held it there too.
[13190.60s -> 13193.08s]  I'm going to give it a full one or two seconds.
[13193.08s -> 13193.96s]  And I don't want him to disappear.
[13193.96s -> 13195.00s]  He goes invisible sometimes.
[13197.22s -> 13198.98s]  I got one more zone here.
[13199.54s -> 13202.23s]  And I've still got lots of upgrades to do.
[13202.23s -> 13203.83s]  Like, all right, it's time.
[13205.00s -> 13206.20s]  I need max HP.
[13206.76s -> 13207.91s]  This is terrible.
[13208.55s -> 13209.43s]  This is actually awful.
[13210.07s -> 13221.03s]  What the hell is that?
[13223.25s -> 13243.75s]  I might actually be in a little bit of trouble.
[13272.40s -> 13274.32s]  This is taking a long time.
[13275.20s -> 13280.55s]  WM1 gameplay.
[13281.27s -> 13283.59s]  Use your cast.
[13284.23s -> 13284.87s]  I don't have one.
[13285.43s -> 13288.48s]  It's just dumpy.
[13300.82s -> 13301.70s]  Always hammer.
[13301.70s -> 13317.97s]  I'm not fooling around here.
[13317.97s -> 13321.33s]  I'm not fooling around.
[13321.33s -> 13329.91s]  Don't crash on me.
[13330.47s -> 13333.12s]  I mean, don't actually don't do that.
[13333.12s -> 13333.68s]  It's like, true.
[13340.87s -> 13341.51s]  Fuck.
[13341.51s -> 13342.40s]  All right.
[13342.40s -> 13346.29s]  What was I swinging?
[13346.29s -> 13347.33s]  I was swinging at the wall.
[13348.13s -> 13370.42s]  Whatever.
[13371.46s -> 13377.28s]  This is not a melee place.
[13377.28s -> 13389.52s]  Let's see.
[13389.52s -> 13393.52s]  After your special hits, your next two attacks deal 80% more damage.
[13393.52s -> 13394.96s]  That's unbelievable.
[13394.96s -> 13397.28s]  Your ball rush gains power, it does 500% damage.
[13398.00s -> 13401.08s]  So now that gives me a reason to use my special.
[13403.43s -> 13405.83s]  Roll the Captain America shield.
[13405.83s -> 13406.39s]  Get in.
[13406.39s -> 13407.27s]  Tap, tap, tap, tap.
[13414.28s -> 13416.55s]  My shield grows stronger.
[13416.55s -> 13417.19s]  Gold earned.
[13422.93s -> 13423.81s]  Five gold in there.
[13423.81s -> 13425.89s]  That's horrible.
[13428.29s -> 13430.13s]  I don't have enough for anything in the shop.
[13430.13s -> 13431.01s]  So I'm going to go money.
[13436.61s -> 13449.16s]  Where are the enemies?
[13451.67s -> 13451.99s]  Hello?
[13452.63s -> 13453.11s]  Where are they?
[13465.25s -> 13467.25s]  Bad place to fight is those guys on the bridge.
[13480.60s -> 13481.32s]  Who else?
[13481.32s -> 13486.80s]  Oh, he's just hiding.
[13487.36s -> 13507.94s]  Will you come out of hiding, please?
[13507.94s -> 13511.33s]  Now I got enough money to really mess around.
[13511.33s -> 13518.28s]  Artemis, for sure.
[13519.54s -> 13522.26s]  Or I could get the lightning jump thing.
[13525.19s -> 13536.77s]  I don't want to get any projectiles.
[13536.77s -> 13550.88s]  Just kill them.
[13550.88s -> 13551.36s]  Spamming.
[13554.85s -> 13555.49s]  Really?
[13555.49s -> 13557.88s]  Who is it?
[13558.68s -> 13559.96s]  All right, there's a chest in here.
[13559.96s -> 13560.84s]  Don't let me forget that.
[13593.86s -> 13595.14s]  Got to kill them faster.
[13612.72s -> 13614.08s]  Good.
[13614.08s -> 13614.64s]  Good.
[13614.64s -> 13615.52s]  There's a chest.
[13615.52s -> 13616.24s]  There, I see it.
[13625.11s -> 13625.75s]  And the shops.
[13628.87s -> 13633.01s]  Oh my god.
[13635.17s -> 13636.45s]  What do I have on now?
[13637.17s -> 13645.78s]  Wait, but no, I don't want that.
[13646.50s -> 13648.10s]  That replaces the double tap.
[13648.66s -> 13653.51s]  The critical effects deal even more damage to armor.
[13654.31s -> 13656.74s]  After you deal a crit, your foe is marked.
[13662.12s -> 13665.00s]  Yeah, in the odd event that that does happen, that's probably better.
[13665.00s -> 13667.62s]  That's all right, must be nothing.
[13674.66s -> 13675.86s]  Kill things fast, right?
[13676.50s -> 13700.24s]  Give me my money.
[13700.24s -> 13700.56s]  Wait.
[13715.99s -> 13718.15s]  I couldn't even kill these guys faster than that.
[13720.05s -> 13721.81s]  But I will take some HP.
[13722.61s -> 13732.98s]  Goodness.
[13733.70s -> 13739.94s]  Excuse me.
[13740.50s -> 13754.24s]  Holy shit, that was horrible.
[13760.74s -> 13764.92s]  Get the bombs out of here and I'll be okay.
[13770.85s -> 13771.65s]  Shitty room.
[13771.65s -> 13772.37s]  Shitty room.
[13772.37s -> 13773.01s]  Shitty room.
[13785.86s -> 13788.10s]  Make this motherfucker killed by his own beams.
[13789.12s -> 13789.68s]  Come up here.
[13791.60s -> 13793.60s]  What did I do that for?
[13794.32s -> 13795.12s]  All right, get hit by this.
[13795.76s -> 13797.97s]  Damn it, it didn't get hit by it.
[13798.61s -> 13800.21s]  I just freaked out.
[13820.00s -> 13822.29s]  Nice shield, asshole.
[13822.29s -> 13823.81s]  I haven't blocked in eight rooms.
[13824.37s -> 13826.85s]  Yeah, but I mean, come on, I'm trying.
[13827.73s -> 13829.01s]  I'm all offense.
[13830.53s -> 13832.37s]  Well, it looks like we're going to go left.
[13833.09s -> 13838.48s]  This guy is so good.
[13838.48s -> 13839.60s]  This guy is unbelievable.
[13839.60s -> 13840.48s]  He's so good.
[13842.56s -> 13846.47s]  His upgrades are incredible.
[13847.11s -> 13849.09s]  Don't need that this time.
[13849.65s -> 13865.52s]  Oh man, that's greedy.
[13866.08s -> 13875.78s]  It's greedy, I know, but it's damage.
[13875.78s -> 13876.82s]  It's a lot of damage.
[13877.62s -> 13887.65s]  Oh my fucking God.
[13887.65s -> 13888.61s]  They're all bow users.
[13889.25s -> 13910.08s]  Who's next?
[13910.08s -> 13918.50s]  That guy's marked.
[13918.50s -> 13919.70s]  That's what that means.
[13919.70s -> 13920.58s]  The grip.
[13920.58s -> 13920.98s]  Shut up.
[13936.15s -> 13938.92s]  I have no idea what's going on.
[13943.51s -> 13944.47s]  God damn it, man.
[13945.19s -> 13947.38s]  Where is this guy?
[13948.02s -> 13961.70s]  Did you actually come back?
[13961.70s -> 13962.74s]  You piece of shit.
[13963.54s -> 13968.02s]  Let me get in there and kill him.
[13968.82s -> 13974.53s]  Piece of shit.
[13977.44s -> 13979.12s]  You piece of fucking shit.
[13979.12s -> 13980.64s]  I hate the shield guys.
[13981.60s -> 13984.76s]  These are my least favorite enemies
[13984.76s -> 13985.64s]  in the whole game, by the way.
[13996.96s -> 13998.72s]  They take forever to fucking kill.
[13998.72s -> 13999.76s]  And then you have to kill them twice
[13999.76s -> 14000.40s]  when they come back.
[14001.99s -> 14003.11s]  Fuck these guys, they suck.
[14003.75s -> 14007.76s]  Oh my goodness.
[14021.84s -> 14026.61s]  What happened to being a shield guy?
[14026.61s -> 14028.18s]  I gave up on that.
[14028.26s -> 14034.56s]  Let's see how quickly I can-
[14034.56s -> 14036.32s]  Oh, these guys jump around so fast.
[14037.04s -> 14058.20s]  Isolate them out.
[14058.20s -> 14069.64s]  Oh, that's a pretty good idea, guys.
[14069.64s -> 14070.44s]  Nice work.
[14070.44s -> 14095.36s]  Look at all the damage you didn't take.
[14095.92s -> 14103.89s]  Yeah, I know.
[14103.89s -> 14104.93s]  Bully, bully, bully.
[14105.49s -> 14125.83s]  Don't let these two assholes get new bodies.
[14125.83s -> 14130.58s]  God damn it, he got a new fucking body.
[14130.58s -> 14131.38s]  Fuck these guys.
[14148.10s -> 14149.06s]  You actually hit me.
[14149.06s -> 14150.42s]  You're hiding behind a fucking wall.
[14150.98s -> 14151.78s]  Get out of here.
[14151.78s -> 14153.06s]  Worth enemy in the fucking game.
[14160.92s -> 14169.04s]  Shop time.
[14169.04s -> 14169.84s]  I can get them all.
[14169.84s -> 14171.04s]  This is perfect.
[14171.04s -> 14172.08s]  And it's boss time.
[14172.08s -> 14174.08s]  All right, I gotta be ready.
[14180.55s -> 14181.35s]  Kill Bull first.
[14181.35s -> 14181.67s]  I will.
[14185.81s -> 14186.21s]  I'll try.
[14206.66s -> 14207.06s]  All right.
[14207.94s -> 14211.94s]  So now I can go whack, whack.
[14212.74s -> 14213.86s]  This is just going to be a game.
[14214.82s -> 14215.70s]  Get the hell out of here.
[14215.70s -> 14216.26s]  Gold earn.
[14216.26s -> 14216.58s]  Where?
[14217.38s -> 14219.22s]  Kill the Bull.
[14220.28s -> 14220.84s]  Dodge.
[14220.84s -> 14221.72s]  Dash around.
[14221.72s -> 14222.44s]  Be careful.
[14222.44s -> 14222.84s]  Be good.
[14223.72s -> 14227.28s]  The hell did you even see that?
[14227.28s -> 14228.08s]  I have no idea.
[14228.64s -> 14229.28s]  All right, I'm ready.
[14235.24s -> 14235.80s]  Kill Bull.
[14237.57s -> 14238.37s]  Backstab Bull.
[14238.37s -> 14238.93s]  Get out.
[14238.93s -> 14239.65s]  Dodge the fire.
[14242.85s -> 14243.89s]  And save.
[14243.89s -> 14245.41s]  Do not do Artemis.
[14256.64s -> 14257.20s]  And block.
[14258.32s -> 14259.60s]  Hold on, not so fast.
[14260.24s -> 14282.31s]  Come on, get over here.
[14282.31s -> 14288.32s]  Give me a Bull.
[14288.32s -> 14292.90s]  Oh, you double fuck.
[14293.70s -> 14294.82s]  Triple fuck.
[14294.82s -> 14296.58s]  That's a triple quadruple fuck right there.
[14323.00s -> 14324.56s]  Right, huh?
[14325.12s -> 14335.76s]  I'm ready for the Bull.
[14335.76s -> 14353.59s]  Don't call me a fiend.
[14363.16s -> 14363.56s]  Damn it.
[14384.63s -> 14385.67s]  Oh, fuck.
[14385.67s -> 14387.19s]  He does, oh my god.
[14387.19s -> 14388.31s]  I'm just blowing it so bad.
[14393.97s -> 14394.69s]  Oh my god.
[14394.69s -> 14395.89s]  I keep, he does three swings.
[14395.89s -> 14396.93s]  I'm blowing it so bad.
[14396.93s -> 14398.13s]  It's just so, but hell.
[14398.93s -> 14415.99s]  He hasn't done that fucking move
[14415.99s -> 14417.35s]  the whole entire encounter.
[14418.15s -> 14418.71s]  Eat shit.
[14419.99s -> 14422.63s]  What just happened?
[14422.63s -> 14444.76s]  Don't do it.
[14445.56s -> 14453.80s]  Where's the, where's he?
[14455.22s -> 14455.78s]  Where's the Bull?
[14460.71s -> 14461.27s]  One, two.
[14462.79s -> 14464.56s]  Wait, he did three.
[14499.40s -> 14506.72s]  He didn't, what?
[14507.68s -> 14509.44s]  He didn't run into the podium.
[14509.44s -> 14510.56s]  He didn't run into the pillar.
[14511.12s -> 14511.76s]  What the fuck?
[14528.36s -> 14529.16s]  Oh, fuck you.
[14532.52s -> 14533.56s]  Oh my god.
[14533.56s -> 14534.44s]  It's a choke.
[14534.44s -> 14535.08s]  It's a choke.
[14570.00s -> 14586.93s]  Ready to admit defeat as yet.
[14590.34s -> 14592.00s]  You block everything, you fucker.
[14618.42s -> 14618.82s]  Hold that.
[14648.15s -> 14649.11s]  Oh, shit.
[14649.11s -> 14651.11s]  They call for a friend.
[14651.11s -> 14652.15s]  I forgot about that.
[14658.40s -> 14660.00s]  Flow and steady wins the race.
[14660.00s -> 14662.24s]  The hair gets run over by a car.
[14662.24s -> 14664.32s]  Don't remember, forget that story.
[14677.17s -> 14679.65s]  Oh, oh, I don't know.
[14679.65s -> 14680.93s]  That just scared the shit out of me.
[14681.57s -> 14695.11s]  Why's he, why's he blocking?
[14696.32s -> 14697.28s]  Oh, right.
[14697.28s -> 14698.08s]  Goddess Dementor.
[14699.44s -> 14702.64s]  Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[14703.44s -> 14705.03s]  Where is he?
[14705.03s -> 14705.51s]  Where'd he go?
[14706.23s -> 14707.59s]  Oh, he's right there.
[14711.46s -> 14712.66s]  Jesus Christ.
[14713.46s -> 14717.30s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14719.04s -> 14719.84s]  Oh, no.
[14722.16s -> 14723.44s]  Oh, no.
[14723.44s -> 14724.08s]  Oh, no.
[14725.36s -> 14726.80s]  It's fucking so hard.
[14728.40s -> 14733.92s]  Holy shit.
[14733.92s -> 14734.80s]  Oh, no.
[14735.60s -> 14737.84s]  No, it's so hard.
[14738.08s -> 14744.15s]  I want a rematch now.
[14744.15s -> 14744.63s]  Damn it.
[14748.07s -> 14748.71s]  No.
[14749.59s -> 14750.71s]  Hey there, Doosa.
[14750.71s -> 14755.65s]  How's your endless toil treating you?
[14755.65s -> 14759.33s]  Mr. Hypnos, do you maybe think that you could, you know,
[14759.33s -> 14763.57s]  keep an eye on the procession line before Lord Hades like you were supposed to?
[14764.13s -> 14767.62s]  That's no problem.
[14767.62s -> 14768.98s]  I can definitely do that.
[14768.98s -> 14770.26s]  I'll just add it to the list.
[14770.26s -> 14772.90s]  Afro damage falls off if you don't find the right stuff.
[14774.87s -> 14782.53s]  Damn.
[14782.53s -> 14783.57s]  I thought I had it, too.
[14783.57s -> 14791.94s]  I just got caught in the purple circles.
[14792.58s -> 14797.43s]  I can give the fish to the chef.
[14797.43s -> 14797.75s]  That's cool.
[14797.75s -> 14798.55s]  Hello, Zagreus.
[14799.11s -> 14800.15s]  You look a little down.
[14801.03s -> 14804.79s]  So I was just wondering, would you perchance fancy a song right now?
[14806.56s -> 14806.88s]  Song?
[14807.76s -> 14809.09s]  I think this is important.
[14809.65s -> 14812.00s]  The lament in the blood or the argonauts?
[14813.41s -> 14819.38s]  Uh, the argonauts.
[14820.18s -> 14821.46s]  How about argonauts?
[14821.46s -> 14822.34s]  Didn't you sail with them?
[14824.36s -> 14825.72s]  Oh, fancy that one, do you?
[14826.28s -> 14828.92s]  Alas, I'm not the heart to sing it anymore.
[14829.80s -> 14831.64s]  I'm glad you like it, though.
[14831.64s -> 14833.12s]  Do I have enough to unlock the...
[14833.12s -> 14833.76s]  I don't think I do.
[14834.48s -> 14836.40s]  All right, let's listen to the shirt.
[14836.96s -> 14840.66s]  Wait, you don't know the song?
[14842.32s -> 14844.08s]  The head chef is going to want this fish.
[14844.08s -> 14846.16s]  What are your sisters up to these days, Meg?
[14846.16s -> 14847.12s]  I've not seen them around.
[14849.49s -> 14851.97s]  We're stretched a little thin, as you can see.
[14851.97s -> 14853.49s]  I have no idea what you just said.
[14853.49s -> 14854.05s]  I wasn't looking.
[14855.17s -> 14858.21s]  All I heard was, I swear to God, this is what I just heard.
[14859.73s -> 14860.85s]  I smell success.
[14860.85s -> 14862.21s]  What does that have to be?
[14862.21s -> 14863.17s]  I didn't hear anything else.
[14863.73s -> 14869.33s]  I didn't hear...
[14869.33s -> 14869.73s]  I didn't...
[14869.73s -> 14870.69s]  I couldn't understand anything.
[14875.91s -> 14877.19s]  I love this voice, though.
[14877.19s -> 14879.59s]  Whoever this voice actress is, fucking great job.
[14879.67s -> 14880.31s]  Good.
[14880.31s -> 14880.79s]  Very good.
[14881.43s -> 14883.24s]  This is my latest hole.
[14883.88s -> 14885.40s]  Oh, 20.
[14886.12s -> 14890.20s]  They're all good.
[14890.20s -> 14891.56s]  The ancient casks of wine.
[14891.56s -> 14896.58s]  It's actually kind of rare that you get a game that actually has good voice acting.
[14896.58s -> 14898.66s]  The toxic-hitting vintage they contain.
[14898.66s -> 14905.51s]  And few are still admitted to anywhere in the vicinity.
[14905.51s -> 14908.07s]  Still waiting for the fest of occasion when we'll open one of these.
[14911.12s -> 14912.16s]  Main character, too.
[14912.16s -> 14912.66s]  Zagras.
[14914.13s -> 14915.17s]  Very collected.
[14915.17s -> 14916.69s]  It's not over the top.
[14916.69s -> 14919.17s]  It's just subtle enough, and it's just interesting enough.
[14919.17s -> 14920.37s]  And he did a great job.
[14920.37s -> 14921.65s]  Actually, perfect job.
[14921.65s -> 14929.30s]  What's new?
[14929.30s -> 14930.42s]  Two keys for 20 gems.
[14930.42s -> 14930.90s]  No, thanks.
[14930.90s -> 14931.30s]  Wait.
[14931.30s -> 14931.70s]  How much is it?
[14931.70s -> 14932.26s]  Can I get a key?
[14935.19s -> 14938.39s]  Is this a psycho thing to do if I buy four keys right now?
[14938.39s -> 14948.24s]  Always use more keys.
[14948.24s -> 14948.74s]  I don't care.
[14951.41s -> 14953.01s]  So what did the fish do?
[14953.73s -> 14964.48s]  Nix must be someplace else.
[14964.48s -> 14965.12s]  Oh, the gems, right.
[14965.12s -> 14965.84s]  Okay.
[14965.84s -> 14969.01s]  Let's unlock the gloves.
[14969.01s -> 14971.92s]  But first...
[14985.16s -> 15000.77s]  I like that better.
[15000.77s -> 15001.25s]  I really do.
[15002.13s -> 15005.03s]  Let's just save the keys.
[15007.43s -> 15008.79s]  Get Death Defiance II.
[15009.43s -> 15013.76s]  I need 600...
[15014.80s -> 15015.36s]  Lopules.
[15016.00s -> 15022.07s]  This?
[15022.07s -> 15031.68s]  Oh, I just get the weapon.
[15031.68s -> 15035.60s]  Hey, pal.
[15035.60s -> 15037.84s]  Watch where you throw those bloodstone things of yours.
[15037.84s -> 15039.28s]  You drop them, you go pick them up.
[15039.28s -> 15040.32s]  You understand?
[15040.32s -> 15041.76s]  But if somebody gives you grief,
[15041.76s -> 15044.08s]  you got my permission to check one right in his eye.
[15044.88s -> 15049.67s]  I just got 5,000 bits.
[15049.67s -> 15052.07s]  50 bucks from Freakout.
[15052.07s -> 15054.71s]  Says, you missed my bits earlier, daddy.
[15056.18s -> 15057.38s]  I don't know if you've been here for a while,
[15057.38s -> 15060.34s]  but I no longer read bits during the stream,
[15060.34s -> 15061.30s]  or after the stream.
[15061.30s -> 15062.26s]  Bits are done.
[15062.26s -> 15065.32s]  Unless, of course, you give Mike that money.
[15065.32s -> 15066.44s]  Pretty much, it's all done.
[15067.46s -> 15069.22s]  I don't know what you're talking about, bud.
[15069.22s -> 15071.86s]  ...since the eyes are a lot harder to hit in my experience.
[15072.92s -> 15073.96s]  3D bastard.
[15073.96s -> 15074.52s]  And you know what?
[15076.12s -> 15077.99s]  I think it's time.
[15077.99s -> 15079.43s]  I think it's time for me to say this now, too.
[15082.21s -> 15083.81s]  I think from here going out,
[15083.81s -> 15088.05s]  I don't think I'm not going to read bits anymore.
[15088.05s -> 15090.74s]  I think it's fair that way.
[15090.74s -> 15096.31s]  I think it's fair.
[15096.39s -> 15102.69s]  Because when I stopped doing the at the end of the stream bits,
[15102.69s -> 15105.54s]  the intention was for, you know,
[15105.54s -> 15107.38s]  I wanted to be able to spend more time streaming
[15107.38s -> 15109.22s]  and not time, you know, at the end of the stream.
[15109.22s -> 15111.38s]  If I have to sit here for an extra, you know,
[15111.38s -> 15112.82s]  if I'm sitting here for four, five, six hours,
[15112.82s -> 15114.02s]  and I have to get up,
[15114.02s -> 15115.38s]  and there's like an hour and a half of bits,
[15115.38s -> 15116.82s]  that's the first part, right?
[15117.54s -> 15118.34s]  The second part is,
[15119.24s -> 15121.16s]  I don't want people to think they have to give more money
[15121.16s -> 15122.52s]  now for me to read their message.
[15123.96s -> 15126.12s]  I'd rather just say it's over completely.
[15134.60s -> 15138.20s]  Because that puts a sort of dumb precedent in place.
[15138.76s -> 15139.80s]  For people to say,
[15139.80s -> 15142.12s]  well, he doesn't read anything that's 200 bits.
[15142.12s -> 15147.43s]  I just give 5,000, he'll read it.
[15147.43s -> 15153.09s]  So I don't, I don't like that precedent.
[15153.09s -> 15154.45s]  Just raise it to 200.
[15161.59s -> 15163.28s]  No, like I said previously,
[15163.28s -> 15166.12s]  I said like a week or two ago,
[15166.12s -> 15167.80s]  if you want to support this stream,
[15167.80s -> 15169.84s]  and you like what you see here,
[15169.84s -> 15171.12s]  and you like this community,
[15171.12s -> 15173.44s]  and you want to subscribe to the channel,
[15173.44s -> 15177.52s]  do that.
[15177.52s -> 15180.05s]  Nobody at this point going forward
[15180.69s -> 15185.03s]  should be giving me 50 to 100 dollars in one drop.
[15189.89s -> 15192.69s]  And people say, dude, I've been watching you for years,
[15192.69s -> 15195.41s]  like, let me give you 50 to 100 dollars right now, right?
[15199.25s -> 15200.45s]  That's not necessary.
[15200.45s -> 15201.73s]  You don't have to do that.
[15201.73s -> 15211.03s]  In fact, I don't want you to do that.
[15211.03s -> 15212.39s]  I've seen that message plenty of times.
[15212.39s -> 15213.75s]  And then, but this community subs, right?
[15213.75s -> 15215.88s]  It's like, what about community subs?
[15215.88s -> 15217.16s]  I think community subs is a little different
[15217.16s -> 15219.56s]  just because it, oh, well.
[15222.52s -> 15224.76s]  Just completely going just against everything
[15224.76s -> 15225.96s]  I was just saying, that's funny.
[15227.12s -> 15231.00s]  But anyways, first of all, let me, let me,
[15231.00s -> 15232.44s]  all right, let me get through this first.
[15234.88s -> 15236.16s]  Community subs are a little different
[15236.16s -> 15238.98s]  just because when you give a community sub,
[15238.98s -> 15241.30s]  somebody that you're giving somebody
[15241.30s -> 15244.42s]  access to the emotes and the, you know,
[15244.42s -> 15245.78s]  ads that I, wait, that doesn't,
[15245.78s -> 15247.22s]  that's not even real anymore, is it?
[15247.22s -> 15249.20s]  You're giving them the sub,
[15249.20s -> 15250.56s]  they can use the emotes,
[15250.56s -> 15252.48s]  and they can, you know, sub only mode,
[15252.48s -> 15253.92s]  that's available, right?
[15253.92s -> 15257.40s]  So you get those perks,
[15257.40s -> 15259.52s]  you're giving those perks to somebody.
[15259.52s -> 15261.20s]  So it's not just me that just gets,
[15261.20s -> 15262.88s]  you know, money and that's it.
[15262.88s -> 15264.08s]  When you give a community subs,
[15264.08s -> 15266.40s]  you're giving somebody that might not be able to
[15266.96s -> 15269.12s]  potentially afford to pay $5 a month,
[15269.68s -> 15275.78s]  that, hey, you can use the emotes.
[15275.78s -> 15279.30s]  So rather than just be just accepting 500,
[15279.30s -> 15281.62s]  you know, 1,000, 550 bucks, 100 bucks,
[15281.62s -> 15282.90s]  200 bucks from one person,
[15286.29s -> 15287.65s]  I just, I think it's more fair that way.
[15288.29s -> 15294.69s]  Just admit it's because you can't read.
[15294.69s -> 15297.17s]  It's been an elaborate scheme this whole time.
[15297.17s -> 15300.50s]  If it's more stuff to use channel points on,
[15301.78s -> 15304.26s]  I want to turn on that like gambling thing,
[15304.26s -> 15305.22s]  like the predict thing.
[15305.22s -> 15306.90s]  I don't have access to that.
[15306.90s -> 15308.50s]  I wish I did, but I don't have,
[15308.50s -> 15309.78s]  I don't think I have access to it.
[15309.78s -> 15310.58s]  I looked in my thing.
[15310.58s -> 15319.38s]  I don't have it.
[15319.38s -> 15320.58s]  It won't give it to me.
[15321.70s -> 15322.58s]  All right, let's open it.
[15322.58s -> 15323.06s]  I don't care.
[15323.06s -> 15323.70s]  What is it?
[15323.70s -> 15325.06s]  I want, that's what I saved it up for.
[15328.68s -> 15329.18s]  Old?
[15333.22s -> 15335.73s]  A rising cutter?
[15339.68s -> 15340.40s]  Dash strike.
[15342.08s -> 15343.36s]  Dash uppercut.
[15343.36s -> 15352.16s]  It's a monk build.
[15353.52s -> 15355.52s]  So there is no, all right, that's going to be weird.
[15361.60s -> 15363.76s]  I'll give him a try.
[15363.76s -> 15364.72s]  I'm probably going to get my ass kicked.
[15364.72s -> 15366.48s]  But let's go over these subs.
[15366.48s -> 15367.92s]  Just really quickly, because there was a lot.
[15369.06s -> 15370.98s]  Addy cake gave 20 community subs,
[15370.98s -> 15372.18s]  which is a ton of money.
[15372.18s -> 15374.50s]  That is more than I even said to not give.
[15375.22s -> 15376.66s]  Right?
[15376.66s -> 15379.46s]  Thanks to the huge amount of money and the community subs.
[15380.10s -> 15381.62s]  Labster five community subs.
[15381.62s -> 15383.70s]  Nondescript civilian 25 community subs,
[15383.70s -> 15386.50s]  which is a shitload of money.
[15386.50s -> 15387.06s]  Litigation.
[15387.06s -> 15388.02s]  Thanks for five subs.
[15388.02s -> 15388.66s]  And destroy.
[15388.66s -> 15389.70s]  Thanks for five subs.
[15389.70s -> 15390.42s]  Destroy, dude.
[15390.42s -> 15402.82s]  You can play with boppities in this game.
[15402.82s -> 15403.22s]  Go left.
[15403.22s -> 15410.93s]  It's a secret area, but he's still reading them.
[15410.93s -> 15412.21s]  Well, community subs.
[15412.21s -> 15418.02s]  I feel like acknowledging community subs is like,
[15418.02s -> 15420.34s]  oh, look, some of you got subs.
[15420.34s -> 15420.90s]  I don't know.
[15420.90s -> 15421.54s]  What do you think?
[15421.54s -> 15425.28s]  But then that brings in the, wait,
[15425.28s -> 15427.12s]  but I could just give a bunch of money
[15427.12s -> 15428.72s]  if I give a shitload of subs, right?
[15430.42s -> 15431.14s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[15431.78s -> 15433.38s]  I just don't want people to think they have to give
[15433.38s -> 15436.26s]  an absolute shitload of money to get me to read it
[15436.26s -> 15438.50s]  when that was not the intention in the first place.
[15438.50s -> 15441.00s]  Just acknowledge nothing.
[15441.00s -> 15442.12s]  Just harvest money.
[15445.24s -> 15446.20s]  I'll try the fists.
[15446.84s -> 15449.67s]  I feel like this is boring.
[15449.83s -> 15451.86s]  My blade.
[15451.86s -> 15453.62s]  Not the fists.
[15453.62s -> 15454.58s]  Like what I've been doing.
[15454.58s -> 15459.48s]  Just the meta of take coin purse, replace with tooth.
[15459.48s -> 15462.47s]  I feel like I, is this boring?
[15462.47s -> 15472.34s]  At just 25 health, but they're not.
[15472.34s -> 15473.22s]  But this upgrades.
[15473.22s -> 15475.14s]  If I use this enough, this is okay.
[15475.14s -> 15477.56s]  Does this eventually get up to 75 health?
[15483.09s -> 15483.97s]  That's a huge deal.
[15484.53s -> 15484.85s]  50.
[15484.85s -> 15485.57s]  That's a big deal.
[15498.82s -> 15500.66s]  Level up all your trinkets of a lad variety
[15500.66s -> 15502.18s]  and you will understand what you want from it.
[15503.04s -> 15503.76s]  Yeah, you know what?
[15525.56s -> 15531.62s]  Let's try these.
[15532.26s -> 15538.39s]  But I'll try those after I put on, I want the money.
[15546.23s -> 15547.67s]  It's all about the money.
[15548.39s -> 15551.41s]  It's a good start.
[15553.68s -> 15558.00s]  Your attack becomes a three hit sequence and each deals 40 base damage.
[15558.64s -> 15565.09s]  You are sturdy while you use your attack.
[15565.73s -> 15567.64s]  You take 30% less damage.
[15567.64s -> 15568.92s]  Your actions cannot be interrupted.
[15572.44s -> 15574.04s]  Oh, three is really good too.
[15574.04s -> 15575.00s]  Three is insane.
[15575.72s -> 15591.12s]  It just breaks any armor instantly.
[15591.12s -> 15592.16s]  They seem like they're kind of fun,
[15592.16s -> 15595.36s]  but the holding down X thing is probably going to mess me up.
[15595.36s -> 15605.75s]  I feel like Little Mac when I have these on.
[15606.31s -> 15614.76s]  I love the dash uppercut.
[15614.76s -> 15615.24s]  It's awesome.
[15616.87s -> 15619.35s]  Try getting Artemis.
[15619.91s -> 15621.35s]  The fast firing is awesome.
[15621.35s -> 15622.47s]  Yeah, that's true.
[15623.35s -> 15624.15s]  What about Zeus?
[15624.15s -> 15626.95s]  Zeus like the chain lightning going chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain.
[15627.59s -> 15643.78s]  So now I understand why, okay.
[15643.78s -> 15645.06s]  Oh, you beat the game.
[15645.06s -> 15646.82s]  No, it's not even what I'm doing.
[15647.54s -> 15650.40s]  That's like saying that if you beat mom's foot,
[15650.40s -> 15652.16s]  then you win Binding of Isaac.
[15652.24s -> 15653.20s]  That's five more subs.
[15653.20s -> 15653.84s]  What?
[15653.84s -> 15654.34s]  Oh, well.
[15660.02s -> 15660.74s]  25?
[15660.74s -> 15661.70s]  All right, I got to shut up.
[15662.34s -> 15673.64s]  Let's get something good.
[15684.28s -> 15685.40s]  Why do I owe subs?
[15685.40s -> 15688.18s]  Because I signed a contract yesterday
[15688.18s -> 15690.12s]  when I first started playing the game
[15690.12s -> 15694.88s]  that I would not reference Binding of Isaac,
[15694.88s -> 15699.56s]  World of Warcraft, Dark Souls,
[15699.56s -> 15700.84s]  and I forget the last game.
[15700.84s -> 15702.04s]  I seriously don't know what it was.
[15702.60s -> 15703.40s]  I forget what it was.
[15703.88s -> 15706.23s]  What was the fourth one?
[15706.23s -> 15709.08s]  Hearthstone.
[15709.08s -> 15709.64s]  Right, right.
[15710.20s -> 15712.28s]  So if I've referenced those...
[15713.08s -> 15714.20s]  No, that's not fair.
[15714.20s -> 15715.40s]  We're in a timeout right now.
[15715.40s -> 15716.28s]  This is a pause.
[15716.28s -> 15716.78s]  I'm...
[15717.40s -> 15719.32s]  No, that's not what this is.
[15719.32s -> 15721.96s]  We are not referencing that in the game.
[15721.96s -> 15725.24s]  We are referencing the fact that that was what the con...
[15725.24s -> 15726.92s]  I'm stating what the contract is.
[15731.84s -> 15733.28s]  And the person that just asked that,
[15733.28s -> 15734.32s]  they're probably like, what the...
[15734.32s -> 15735.28s]  Who fucking cares?
[15735.28s -> 15736.16s]  Like, what are you talking about?
[15737.19s -> 15738.79s]  I have a tendency on this stream
[15739.76s -> 15744.00s]  to always call back to those four games
[15745.24s -> 15747.08s]  all the time, like every stream.
[15747.08s -> 15749.16s]  So I'm trying to give myself a...
[15749.16s -> 15750.72s]  I'm trying to get away from it.
[15750.72s -> 15761.25s]  Your special causes a bolt...
[15761.25s -> 15762.77s]  Lightning Bolt to strike nearby foes.
[15762.77s -> 15763.97s]  That looks pretty good.
[15763.97s -> 15770.26s]  Your dash causes a lightning bolt to...
[15770.26s -> 15771.78s]  Ah, that's actually good too.
[15771.78s -> 15774.52s]  I like this one.
[15779.11s -> 15779.75s]  Ooh, all right.
[15780.39s -> 15782.39s]  Water or fire?
[15782.39s -> 15784.13s]  How about Poseidon?
[15784.93s -> 15797.97s]  Pretty good.
[15797.97s -> 15798.47s]  Uppercut.
[15804.80s -> 15807.12s]  There's a pretty heavy reach on this thing too.
[15807.92s -> 15820.53s]  Do you know why I like this game so much?
[15820.53s -> 15822.45s]  And why I'm very into playing this game?
[15823.17s -> 15827.44s]  It's mainly because it has actually been a very long time
[15827.44s -> 15829.28s]  since a game like this has come out
[15831.68s -> 15833.20s]  that I've actually enjoyed playing.
[15836.76s -> 15839.96s]  This rogue-like items and upgrades room to room.
[15840.76s -> 15841.88s]  It's been a while.
[15848.13s -> 15849.41s]  No, not any video game.
[15849.41s -> 15852.61s]  I'm just saying just in general, like the genre.
[15852.61s -> 15856.69s]  It's been a while since the genre has had a game like this that I enjoyed.
[15856.69s -> 15859.86s]  That's good.
[15860.42s -> 15865.60s]  Well, I need a dash.
[15866.96s -> 15868.16s]  This is just safety.
[15877.41s -> 15877.91s]  Fish.
[15879.01s -> 15879.89s]  Play Transistor.
[15879.89s -> 15880.69s]  It's even better.
[15880.69s -> 15883.17s]  I was told that Transistor is not like this.
[15884.05s -> 15890.21s]  Is that correct?
[15890.77s -> 15899.78s]  See that shield break?
[15899.78s -> 15904.80s]  Transistor is not like this, but it's still very good.
[15911.52s -> 15912.72s]  A Cylastrocyon.
[15913.52s -> 15914.24s]  Cylastrocyon.
[15914.24s -> 15914.80s]  That's what I said.
[15920.63s -> 15922.87s]  The next boon you find has an upgraded rarity.
[15922.87s -> 15923.51s]  I like that.
[15924.31s -> 15938.74s]  Well, we're getting the key.
[15942.08s -> 15944.00s]  Given that one took you 50 tries.
[15944.80s -> 15947.84s]  Is that good?
[15953.04s -> 15953.60s]  That's great.
[15956.79s -> 15957.83s]  This game's good.
[15957.83s -> 15958.55s]  It's very good.
[15959.11s -> 15960.47s]  Hey, remember when I took a point up?
[15960.95s -> 15962.23s]  Maybe I went at a 91.
[15963.28s -> 15964.32s]  Oh, the point came back.
[15964.96s -> 15969.81s]  Plus two keys.
[15970.37s -> 15980.53s]  Is better fish?
[15980.53s -> 15981.41s]  Oh, that's cool.
[15981.41s -> 15990.88s]  Fists are cool.
[15991.52s -> 16001.40s]  You just absolutely shred people with the armor crusher.
[16009.33s -> 16011.41s]  I did Aphrodite last time and it didn't work out.
[16026.79s -> 16027.83s]  Look at that shred.
[16028.47s -> 16049.75s]  Nice.
[16051.27s -> 16052.07s]  250 damage.
[16052.07s -> 16052.55s]  That's pretty good.
[16053.11s -> 16056.98s]  See the urn?
[16061.94s -> 16064.58s]  Oh, I want to play this again.
[16065.54s -> 16067.46s]  I don't think I'm going to beat it tonight.
[16067.46s -> 16069.17s]  But I hope I'm going to play.
[16069.17s -> 16069.57s]  Here we go.
[16069.57s -> 16069.97s]  Here you go.
[16069.97s -> 16070.85s]  Ready?
[16070.85s -> 16071.73s]  Here's the plan.
[16071.73s -> 16074.58s]  Plan is tomorrow we're going to change it up.
[16075.14s -> 16076.96s]  Tomorrow's chat's choice.
[16076.96s -> 16078.45s]  I'm not done tonight.
[16078.45s -> 16078.93s]  I'm just saying.
[16079.49s -> 16081.01s]  Tomorrow's chat's choice.
[16081.01s -> 16083.41s]  So pre-stream chat tomorrow like an hour before the stream.
[16083.41s -> 16084.61s]  Somewhere around like two o'clock or so.
[16084.61s -> 16085.57s]  One to two o'clock.
[16085.57s -> 16087.22s]  We will play something else.
[16089.12s -> 16092.66s]  Then after chat's choice tomorrow.
[16092.66s -> 16103.72s]  We're going to go back to this and I'm going to play this again.
[16103.72s -> 16105.16s]  Because I'm into it.
[16105.16s -> 16107.80s]  And it's been it's been a pretty long time since I've been into a game like this.
[16107.80s -> 16111.30s]  So I'm playing it.
[16111.30s -> 16111.86s]  He's addicted.
[16111.86s -> 16113.28s]  Yes, I am.
[16113.28s -> 16113.52s]  All right.
[16113.52s -> 16125.76s]  Should I get the cast?
[16125.76s -> 16129.70s]  Oh, that one.
[16129.70s -> 16130.90s]  And keys.
[16134.16s -> 16136.05s]  He doesn't like Noita.
[16136.05s -> 16137.01s]  No, I just I'm not.
[16137.01s -> 16139.01s]  I it couldn't it didn't click with me.
[16141.76s -> 16143.60s]  This skill based wise.
[16143.60s -> 16147.92s]  I was like you may as well just put a I've had a paper bag on my head that whole time.
[16149.54s -> 16154.82s]  That terraria style mouse kind of aiming keyboard side scrolling.
[16154.82s -> 16156.58s]  I'm not I'm not very good at it.
[16157.46s -> 16160.12s]  Let's get hit.
[16160.92s -> 16168.92s]  Is there an error here?
[16171.78s -> 16172.02s]  It is.
[16172.66s -> 16179.86s]  This game feels like right up my alley.
[16179.86s -> 16181.62s]  I just I like playing it.
[16181.62s -> 16184.88s]  That's not to say I didn't like playing Noita.
[16189.54s -> 16193.78s]  Just this is much more in my wheelhouse of video games that I like to play.
[16193.78s -> 16195.94s]  I only got two gigs of RAM.
[16195.94s -> 16196.66s]  That's punch.
[16197.38s -> 16200.00s]  Yeah, punch is like 200 megabytes.
[16200.80s -> 16204.32s]  Dash is probably 1000 megabytes because you need to get that correctly.
[16205.49s -> 16207.57s]  And then special is 200 megabytes.
[16208.47s -> 16209.27s]  And then move.
[16209.27s -> 16212.87s]  Don't get hit by stuff is another probably 800 megabytes.
[16212.87s -> 16219.28s]  If I may be so bold, your highness, I was wondering what brings you back around this way again.
[16219.84s -> 16220.96s]  Same story as last time.
[16225.16s -> 16226.36s]  He's out of space.
[16229.16s -> 16231.20s]  Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus.
[16231.84s -> 16234.36s]  I'm leaving the house quite enough.
[16234.92s -> 16235.48s]  You understand.
[16235.48s -> 16237.56s]  I'm sure I'm going to the surface.
[16237.56s -> 16238.20s]  Data leak.
[16239.08s -> 16242.12s]  Yeah, there's like some kind of acid leaking out of the motherboard.
[16242.12s -> 16246.28s]  If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told.
[16246.28s -> 16248.84s]  Though you're just mad enough to pull it off.
[16248.84s -> 16250.92s]  Oh, hey, I hope you make it.
[16250.92s -> 16251.88s]  Good fortune out there.
[16256.47s -> 16257.11s]  Okay.
[16257.11s -> 16260.76s]  Let's give him money.
[16262.29s -> 16262.77s]  Or no.
[16263.73s -> 16266.58s]  Yeah, give him money.
[16266.58s -> 16269.78s]  My dear.
[16269.78s -> 16270.42s]  Cheers, mate.
[16271.22s -> 16272.18s]  I have any.
[16272.18s -> 16272.82s]  Can I gift you?
[16274.28s -> 16282.93s]  That's it.
[16284.05s -> 16286.72s]  I don't have any nectar.
[16286.72s -> 16287.92s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[16287.92s -> 16289.12s]  What is it now?
[16289.12s -> 16292.00s]  Let's see your relatives upon Olympus get you out of this.
[16293.12s -> 16296.71s]  Survive for 45 seconds.
[16297.59s -> 16307.48s]  That move is so good.
[16308.20s -> 16310.04s]  Hope I can upgrade that move, too.
[16310.04s -> 16310.76s]  That's the best part.
[16311.56s -> 16337.99s]  Lightning, lightning, lightning.
[16337.99s -> 16342.23s]  Five, four, three, two, one, kill them.
[16343.43s -> 16344.07s]  That's enough.
[16344.71s -> 16346.26s]  Peace and quiet.
[16346.26s -> 16349.78s]  From a quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[16350.34s -> 16352.55s]  What is that?
[16355.11s -> 16355.83s]  Is that a lizard?
[16356.79s -> 16361.08s]  It's a lizard.
[16361.72s -> 16368.31s]  That's a pretty cool lizard.
[16373.03s -> 16374.31s]  Wait, what day is it today?
[16377.38s -> 16379.68s]  This is October?
[16379.68s -> 16380.96s]  Oh, no, it's November.
[16380.96s -> 16383.80s]  Oh, oh, shit, look at this.
[16389.83s -> 16391.43s]  Lizard of days past.
[16399.52s -> 16400.16s]  That's a cool lizard.
[16402.58s -> 16403.54s]  Or Gecko.
[16407.19s -> 16408.23s]  That's just level two.
[16409.27s -> 16410.98s]  Probably three.
[16411.54s -> 16413.00s]  Three or one.
[16422.20s -> 16422.44s]  Two?
[16423.08s -> 16427.36s]  Three is more damage than all of them.
[16427.36s -> 16428.56s]  Oh, I guess because it's a double.
[16428.56s -> 16429.04s]  Right, I forgot.
[16429.04s -> 16429.84s]  I can dash twice.
[16430.56s -> 16444.79s]  So far, so good.
[16445.35s -> 16446.31s]  Let's just hope it scales.
[16455.88s -> 16457.54s]  We should play Gex tomorrow.
[16457.54s -> 16459.14s]  I played Gex already and it was dog shit.
[16459.86s -> 16460.34s]  Oops.
[16460.34s -> 16462.26s]  I should, I, all right, you can tell I'm a little...
[16464.10s -> 16464.74s]  It was okay.
[16465.70s -> 16466.66s]  It was good.
[16466.66s -> 16467.46s]  It was good.
[16467.46s -> 16468.18s]  It was good.
[16469.06s -> 16469.94s]  It was good.
[16470.58s -> 16472.71s]  Hi, Mies.
[16472.71s -> 16474.15s]  Kind of swiftness, travel,
[16474.15s -> 16476.31s]  bringing souls of the departed to your boat.
[16476.31s -> 16476.63s]  Whatever.
[16476.63s -> 16478.23s]  He calls you his professional associate.
[16478.79s -> 16481.43s]  You and he, you've been working together for a while, haven't you?
[16482.15s -> 16485.00s]  He's high?
[16485.00s -> 16485.56s]  No, I'm not.
[16489.78s -> 16490.50s]  Well, I can get it all.
[16490.50s -> 16490.98s]  Take it all.
[16491.54s -> 16494.18s]  Take this one.
[16494.18s -> 16494.82s]  Aphrodite.
[16500.39s -> 16501.03s]  Aphrodite.
[16502.39s -> 16503.99s]  I want to give you more gifts.
[16503.99s -> 16505.59s]  I want, you, you can be,
[16505.59s -> 16506.71s]  there's romance in this game?
[16507.75s -> 16511.41s]  That's good.
[16512.13s -> 16514.44s]  Wait, Aphrodite's call.
[16515.16s -> 16521.57s]  Your call fire is a seeking projectile that inflicts charm.
[16522.13s -> 16524.61s]  For a short time, the victim fights for you
[16524.61s -> 16526.21s]  with greater strength and speed.
[16528.20s -> 16533.89s]  Oh, this thing is 200, 2500 damage?
[16534.53s -> 16539.19s]  Does it work on bosses?
[16539.83s -> 16545.91s]  It does.
[16548.95s -> 16551.43s]  This is almost too good to ignore though.
[16551.99s -> 16555.80s]  But I'm going to make the wrong call
[16555.80s -> 16556.52s]  and I'm going to get the call.
[16570.28s -> 16571.64s]  Damage is only if it's max.
[16573.64s -> 16576.68s]  Yeah, but how much more strength and damage do they do?
[16576.68s -> 16578.60s]  Says when they're charmed, they do more damage, right?
[16585.73s -> 16586.21s]  Shitload.
[16586.77s -> 16590.98s]  After using call, gain dodge, chance,
[16590.98s -> 16592.26s]  dodge chance, and move speed.
[16596.48s -> 16599.60s]  After you dash, briefly become sturdy and move 100% faster.
[16600.80s -> 16601.76s]  Yeah, it's that one.
[16602.56s -> 16616.13s]  It's not very long though, is it?
[16616.77s -> 16622.47s]  All right, let's go kill Meg for like a thousandth time.
[16628.84s -> 16630.34s]  She's different.
[16630.90s -> 16635.01s]  What is this?
[16650.69s -> 16652.21s]  Is this Tissyphone?
[16652.77s -> 16654.45s]  Not Meg anymore?
[16657.54s -> 16659.06s]  Is it because I killed Meg too many times?
[16671.97s -> 16672.53s]  Well, let's go.
[16673.41s -> 16675.48s]  We have a new moveset too.
[16676.04s -> 16683.76s]  Is it poison?
[16684.48s -> 16685.46s]  Looks like poison.
[16686.34s -> 16687.46s]  Is there a poison cure here?
[16693.11s -> 16697.51s]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[16697.51s -> 16698.95s]  Why do I have hard Meg?
[16698.95s -> 16700.63s]  I don't want to fight hard Meg.
[16700.63s -> 16702.63s]  I want the easy Meg that I kill easily.
[16703.51s -> 16709.01s]  Oh, she's my friend.
[16723.68s -> 16726.45s]  Oh, we have a new moveset.
[16726.45s -> 16727.33s]  This is not fair.
[16727.33s -> 16727.97s]  I don't know what the hell.
[16737.49s -> 16738.29s]  What?
[16738.29s -> 16740.98s]  What the hell's going on?
[16749.38s -> 16750.34s]  Beat her up while she's charmed.
[16751.78s -> 16767.41s]  Oh, it kind of works.
[16781.92s -> 16782.72s]  Well, where'd you go?
[16783.52s -> 16784.00s]  There you are.
[16793.35s -> 16794.63s]  Oh, fuck you, Tissyphone.
[16803.62s -> 16804.82s]  What the fuck?
[16804.82s -> 16806.34s]  What the hell is going on here?
[16807.38s -> 16811.22s]  This is such a shitty area to fight somebody.
[16826.93s -> 16828.53s]  Why are you so much harder than the other one?
[16830.48s -> 16831.12s]  What?
[16831.12s -> 16831.60s]  I'm dead?
[16832.32s -> 16841.83s]  Well, that was unexpected.
[16864.15s -> 16865.11s]  The symphony.
[16875.09s -> 16876.29s]  Can't beat Tissyphone.
[16878.69s -> 16882.88s]  This is where I pick grenade up.
[16882.88s -> 16884.64s]  Put grenade in my phone pin.
[16885.96s -> 16887.56s]  Just lob it over there and just go like this.
[16893.16s -> 16893.96s]  New stuff, hold on.
[16902.47s -> 16904.15s]  Now, if only Twitch would do this.
[16904.15s -> 16904.87s]  That would be great.
[16916.16s -> 16922.02s]  This musician need not be so indulged.
[16922.02s -> 16924.42s]  Oh, so what does it do?
[16924.42s -> 16925.54s]  You are home.
[16925.54s -> 16926.79s]  Listen.
[16926.79s -> 16927.59s]  Some new music.
[16928.39s -> 16935.56s]  Does it spend a diamond on the sound test options menu?
[16936.12s -> 16944.47s]  I don't have two.
[16946.58s -> 16951.54s]  Nix, sometimes I get the impression the Olympians look down on those of us born at the Underworld.
[16951.54s -> 16954.10s]  Is that my imagination or what do you make of it?
[16954.10s -> 16960.31s]  Gods of Mount Olympus tend to think themselves above us, child.
[16960.95s -> 16962.71s]  Or so your father often likes to say.
[16962.71s -> 16964.71s]  You have to buy the rest for more diamonds.
[16966.72s -> 16978.37s]  Well, there's your end game, Sync.
[16978.37s -> 16979.49s]  Anything new in here?
[16979.49s -> 16980.13s]  Yes, there is.
[16980.13s -> 16980.61s]  What do you got?
[16981.25s -> 16982.66s]  Here's what I caught.
[16984.72s -> 16985.36s]  30 bucks.
[16986.16s -> 16988.52s]  I think that's worth 100.
[16990.28s -> 16995.92s]  How many keys do I have?
[16997.96s -> 16999.56s]  Okay, I need to buy.
[17012.26s -> 17013.94s]  Ambers may contain 10 gold.
[17014.50s -> 17017.78s]  What a waste of 60 gems unless that's the final thing you ever upgrade.
[17018.50s -> 17021.04s]  I need keys.
[17021.76s -> 17031.75s]  Too good to pass up.
[17036.48s -> 17039.04s]  Somebody said you need to feed her some bug snacks.
[17039.68s -> 17049.11s]  There she goes again.
[17049.75s -> 17051.41s]  I'm gonna get out of here.
[17051.41s -> 17053.41s]  Go back to, go back to Undertale, Temmie.
[17083.70s -> 17085.06s]  I just almost ended my stream.
[17127.40s -> 17129.49s]  I need four more keys.
[17129.49s -> 17133.49s]  Thanks.
[17133.49s -> 17134.37s]  Achilles or Riot?
[17134.37s -> 17135.09s]  Achilles or Riot?
[17135.09s -> 17135.81s]  I don't know where he is.
[17135.81s -> 17136.85s]  Where's Achilles?
[17136.85s -> 17137.81s]  Where is he?
[17137.81s -> 17139.57s]  He's not in his usual hiding place.
[17141.54s -> 17142.66s]  Oh, there he is.
[17142.66s -> 17146.50s]  You're much too modest, Lord Achilles, for someone with such a number of heroic deeds
[17146.50s -> 17148.58s]  and glorious decapitations to his name.
[17149.22s -> 17152.34s]  You ought to be more like ever boastful Sagrius and talk it up some more.
[17152.98s -> 17156.80s]  Oh, fear not, Orpheus.
[17156.80s -> 17158.32s]  I was quite boastful of my day.
[17159.12s -> 17160.40s]  Would you look at where it got me?
[17161.36s -> 17165.20s]  Besides, I've not the imagination to come up with tails as tall as those of Achilles.
[17165.20s -> 17167.28s]  Achilles or we Trojan horse you?
[17168.00s -> 17173.86s]  So you're all gonna deliver a horsey to my house and go in it?
[17176.21s -> 17179.25s]  And then I'm gonna open the door and you guys are gonna all come in and murder me?
[17179.97s -> 17183.81s]  Okay.
[17183.81s -> 17184.61s]  Well, I'm here.
[17185.33s -> 17189.80s]  I'm talking to Achilles.
[17190.44s -> 17194.13s]  Ow.
[17194.13s -> 17194.61s]  I'm sorry.
[17195.25s -> 17197.03s]  All right.
[17197.03s -> 17197.91s]  Achilles or riot.
[17199.70s -> 17200.10s]  We did it.
[17200.10s -> 17200.50s]  No use.
[17202.87s -> 17213.14s]  Talk to dad.
[17213.94s -> 17216.79s]  So tell me something, father, if you please.
[17216.79s -> 17220.15s]  Since we're more candid lately in regard to matters of my birthright here and all.
[17220.71s -> 17222.79s]  Did you and mother how to put this?
[17223.43s -> 17225.36s]  Any brothers or sisters I should know about?
[17227.41s -> 17230.05s]  I thought I told you never to invoke her here.
[17230.05s -> 17232.76s]  Bastard kin.
[17233.56s -> 17236.12s]  It was like a ace attorney.
[17236.76s -> 17239.56s]  Why would you think I'd risk another such as you?
[17239.56s -> 17243.24s]  Sure.
[17243.24s -> 17244.12s]  That's fair enough.
[17244.12s -> 17246.36s]  It's just not all such things occur.
[17246.36s -> 17247.88s]  I almost said attorney's law.
[17247.88s -> 17249.64s]  From tales of your brothers and so forth.
[17251.73s -> 17255.19s]  Blast to my brothers and blast you as well.
[17255.19s -> 17258.23s]  All those who know me know I have no heir.
[17258.23s -> 17260.85s]  You could not rise to the occasion if you tried.
[17261.73s -> 17263.25s]  And there is no one else.
[17264.05s -> 17276.32s]  You have only me and I have only.
[17276.32s -> 17279.52s]  Those these expensive gems and stuff down here.
[17280.64s -> 17282.02s]  But what do you buy with it?
[17284.34s -> 17286.82s]  This is one weird ghost to the trade.
[17289.30s -> 17290.58s]  What do you even buy with this stuff?
[17291.22s -> 17296.55s]  Look at all these gems and jewels.
[17296.55s -> 17297.83s]  I mean, there's no Denny's here.
[17298.47s -> 17301.62s]  There's no mall.
[17301.62s -> 17304.10s]  What are you supposed to do with this money?
[17309.12s -> 17311.97s]  Gotta say, you're really getting somewhere, boy.
[17311.97s -> 17313.49s]  Oh, I'm pretty impressed here.
[17313.49s -> 17314.85s]  And they don't even pay me to do that.
[17314.85s -> 17315.97s]  I'm just supposed to stand around.
[17315.97s -> 17318.85s]  Paying for the Denny's breakfast combo with gems.
[17320.82s -> 17321.32s]  Yeah.
[17321.86s -> 17323.73s]  What else are you going to do with this stuff?
[17323.73s -> 17325.17s]  He's wearing it all over him.
[17327.73s -> 17330.53s]  And money doesn't really have value anymore, guys, when you have a belt.
[17331.33s -> 17334.29s]  That the belt buckle is a golden jeweled skull.
[17334.29s -> 17338.53s]  And inside of the skull's mouth is other skull jeweled rubies and stuff.
[17339.17s -> 17341.57s]  He's wearing a championship belt of money.
[17342.13s -> 17345.40s]  He doesn't really think he cares about gems anymore.
[17354.12s -> 17360.61s]  It's a decoration.
[17370.07s -> 17372.52s]  Oh, this is a gun.
[17375.32s -> 17376.60s]  That's a Falco gun.
[17376.60s -> 17377.24s]  What is that?
[17377.80s -> 17380.12s]  It's eight.
[17380.12s -> 17382.76s]  Oh, I need to get it right now.
[17382.76s -> 17383.64s]  I want it now.
[17384.44s -> 17392.56s]  Let's see here.
[17392.56s -> 17393.12s]  Oh, right.
[17393.12s -> 17395.04s]  I died because I threw at the end there.
[17395.04s -> 17395.28s]  All right.
[17395.28s -> 17396.48s]  I'm going to keep the purse on.
[17397.12s -> 17400.96s]  But we're going up.
[17400.96s -> 17417.44s]  Oh, time.
[17417.44s -> 17423.27s]  My first win was with the gun.
[17430.76s -> 17431.32s]  That works.
[17432.79s -> 17433.35s]  That works.
[17437.46s -> 17439.38s]  What is the explosive shot?
[17440.10s -> 17447.78s]  It takes us such a long time.
[17448.34s -> 17454.10s]  Does the explosion hurt me?
[17454.66s -> 17455.54s]  Let's find out.
[17456.18s -> 17458.21s]  It doesn't.
[17458.21s -> 17458.71s]  Okay.
[17459.41s -> 17461.73s]  I gotta get that timing right.
[17462.61s -> 17471.57s]  300% damage is insane.
[17471.57s -> 17472.07s]  Yeah.
[17472.37s -> 17475.57s]  I don't care how long it takes.
[17476.29s -> 17481.76s]  The bosses, though.
[17482.88s -> 17484.48s]  Oh, this might not be very good.
[17485.12s -> 17493.72s]  If I get chaos with this, then.
[17493.72s -> 17494.68s]  Somebody said chaos?
[17498.10s -> 17498.42s]  All right.
[17498.42s -> 17499.22s]  This is important.
[17499.78s -> 17503.11s]  This is really important.
[17504.26s -> 17508.90s]  If I can get this to be insane, this could be huge.
[17524.58s -> 17525.70s]  Let's look over at the image.
[17527.22s -> 17528.90s]  All your attacks lose 50% damage,
[17528.90s -> 17530.10s]  but you get a slice of bologna.
[17530.10s -> 17531.46s]  It's just still on my other monitor.
[17532.18s -> 17546.55s]  I mean, it's one.
[17547.43s -> 17551.72s]  Can't earn money.
[17551.72s -> 17552.28s]  Who cares?
[17553.00s -> 17560.76s]  This is the run.
[17560.76s -> 17561.40s]  Don't throw.
[17562.44s -> 17563.08s]  I'm going to try.
[17576.20s -> 17577.24s]  Don't need a full charge.
[17577.24s -> 17578.52s]  That's important to understand here.
[17579.32s -> 17580.68s]  Full charge is not even necessary.
[17581.32s -> 17583.51s]  Just land it.
[17583.51s -> 17606.90s]  200.
[17607.54s -> 17613.11s]  I love the charge sound.
[17613.67s -> 17632.76s]  Like, I got hurt?
[17632.76s -> 17633.80s]  How would I get hurt by?
[17633.80s -> 17639.14s]  I don't have enough to wait.
[17639.78s -> 17641.14s]  I can get the health upgrade.
[17641.14s -> 17642.26s]  Wait, is it another chaos?
[17642.90s -> 17643.86s]  Did I miss a chaos?
[17644.74s -> 17645.22s]  Shut up.
[17645.78s -> 17646.58s]  No, I didn't.
[17646.58s -> 17646.98s]  Did I?
[17651.44s -> 17651.68s]  No.
[17651.68s -> 17652.24s]  Oh, my God.
[17652.24s -> 17653.84s]  You scared me so much.
[17653.84s -> 17655.92s]  Oh, my chest is on fire.
[17670.84s -> 17672.04s]  Guys, I don't understand.
[17673.62s -> 17674.74s]  I don't know what's happening to me.
[17679.36s -> 17679.76s]  Stop it.
[17680.56s -> 17681.44s]  I got to relax.
[17681.44s -> 17681.76s]  Thank you.
[17697.73s -> 17699.01s]  This is really awesome.
[17699.57s -> 17701.54s]  Just need a ton more damage on this.
[17702.18s -> 17703.62s]  And this will be unbeatable.
[17712.04s -> 17713.32s]  The timing is a little weird, though.
[17713.32s -> 17714.04s]  Oh, come on.
[17714.04s -> 17714.36s]  Really?
[17719.24s -> 17724.08s]  Hey, Artemis of the blue.
[17725.44s -> 17726.64s]  You're of the grain in this game,
[17726.64s -> 17727.68s]  but thank you for the five subs.
[17738.12s -> 17739.72s]  Okay, your special is hangover,
[17739.72s -> 17741.00s]  which I like,
[17741.56s -> 17743.48s]  because I can just kind of fan that.
[17744.12s -> 17746.24s]  The cast lobs a large explosive
[17746.24s -> 17747.84s]  that bursts into festive fog.
[17747.84s -> 17750.63s]  This is just a stun.
[17752.13s -> 17753.57s]  Yeah, let me try that.
[17753.57s -> 17754.37s]  To my health.
[17754.37s -> 17757.20s]  It's a very long cast.
[17758.08s -> 17758.72s]  It hurts me.
[17759.28s -> 17760.37s]  Okay, no, it doesn't.
[17760.93s -> 17763.46s]  And aim it.
[17764.10s -> 17768.93s]  Okay, that's not bad.
[17769.97s -> 17772.21s]  And when they're stunned, I can blow them up.
[17773.14s -> 17773.78s]  That's great.
[17774.34s -> 17775.30s]  That works out pretty well.
[17776.71s -> 17777.11s]  More health.
[17787.33s -> 17787.65s]  Thank you.
[17787.65s -> 17787.89s]  Thank you.
[17787.89s -> 17788.21s]  Thank you.
[17788.21s -> 17788.45s]  Thank you.
[17788.45s -> 17789.25s]  Any fish?
[17789.25s -> 17794.93s]  Do not see fish.
[17798.23s -> 17821.04s]  That actually works really not.
[17821.04s -> 17821.52s]  It's all right.
[17822.08s -> 17835.08s]  Oh, yeah, the bow is great.
[17835.08s -> 17836.28s]  Bow and shield are my favorites.
[17836.92s -> 17846.39s]  Defeater.
[17851.67s -> 17852.71s]  Defeater boons.
[17852.71s -> 17853.03s]  Puke.
[17868.72s -> 17872.29s]  So this is a good combo here,
[17872.29s -> 17875.36s]  because you can,
[17876.32s -> 17879.83s]  I could do that and the stun
[17879.83s -> 17880.71s]  and then blow them all up.
[17881.35s -> 17889.65s]  So it's like you go wham, wham, boom.
[17890.37s -> 17898.64s]  Or you go wham, wham, boom.
[17898.64s -> 17905.97s]  Remember, I just watched a TikTok
[17905.97s -> 17907.57s]  of somebody making soap.
[17908.13s -> 17909.64s]  Probably cool.
[17909.64s -> 17911.75s]  I don't know.
[17911.75s -> 17913.43s]  The ACDC freak gave five subs.
[17913.43s -> 17914.47s]  Thank you, ACDC freak.
[17914.47s -> 17915.59s]  Didn't they just come up with a new album?
[17916.39s -> 17920.66s]  Didn't ACDC just release a new album?
[17921.22s -> 17929.01s]  And it's good.
[17929.97s -> 17932.29s]  Don't they sound exactly the same, too?
[17932.29s -> 17936.28s]  They haven't changed at all.
[17936.28s -> 17943.12s]  How do they still sound the same?
[17943.12s -> 17944.32s]  Aren't they 80?
[17944.32s -> 17953.52s]  It's pretty good.
[17969.83s -> 17970.23s]  It's good.
[17970.87s -> 17984.31s]  It's very good.
[17987.24s -> 17988.12s]  There's a chest in here, too.
[17988.12s -> 17988.84s]  Don't let me forget that.
[18003.44s -> 18010.50s]  10.
[18010.50s -> 18013.94s]  This chest is for up to 100 gold.
[18015.94s -> 18016.90s]  Just combo the hell out of me.
[18016.90s -> 18019.97s]  Transgressions are not tolerable.
[18019.97s -> 18021.01s]  Slay foes quickly.
[18021.73s -> 18041.48s]  Oh, I could have killed them
[18041.48s -> 18042.36s]  that much faster than that.
[18042.36s -> 18048.60s]  Who's going to clean all this up?
[18048.60s -> 18049.72s]  You have to have an insane build
[18049.72s -> 18051.32s]  to be able to kill things in a second.
[18052.36s -> 18055.72s]  Missed anything?
[18060.90s -> 18061.54s]  Me, me, me.
[18061.54s -> 18062.02s]  What are you doing?
[18069.67s -> 18070.31s]  Survive.
[18070.31s -> 18070.71s]  Uh-oh.
[18070.71s -> 18083.28s]  Come on, then.
[18083.28s -> 18084.00s]  I have the explosive.
[18084.00s -> 18084.32s]  I'm good.
[18084.88s -> 18093.65s]  Just keep him on that bridge.
[18094.37s -> 18104.37s]  Oh, shit.
[18104.37s -> 18104.77s]  Watch out.
[18107.41s -> 18108.85s]  Oh, right at the end, really.
[18109.49s -> 18110.84s]  It's a good strategy, too.
[18111.56s -> 18118.96s]  That's that.
[18118.96s -> 18120.63s]  Did I get to the final boss yet?
[18120.63s -> 18121.11s]  Yes.
[18121.11s -> 18121.91s]  A couple of times.
[18124.08s -> 18125.60s]  I've gotten the final...
[18125.60s -> 18126.96s]  Well, I don't know if it's the final boss,
[18126.96s -> 18127.76s]  but I've gotten the...
[18128.40s -> 18129.68s]  I got the final boss
[18130.48s -> 18131.84s]  of the story mode or whatever
[18132.56s -> 18133.92s]  down to the second phase.
[18135.36s -> 18138.34s]  One more key gets me a gun.
[18138.98s -> 18139.38s]  It does.
[18140.87s -> 18142.16s]  What's for sale?
[18144.07s -> 18147.88s]  I want that.
[18148.44s -> 18158.31s]  300 damage.
[18158.31s -> 18159.52s]  Tringers.
[18159.52s -> 18160.00s]  Tringers?
[18160.64s -> 18163.00s]  Oh, shit.
[18163.00s -> 18164.68s]  For a second, I thought I had a different move.
[18165.32s -> 18183.88s]  What's it hitting?
[18183.88s -> 18185.24s]  Where's the treasure trove?
[18185.24s -> 18188.40s]  Did they say the treasure trove was going to spawn?
[18188.40s -> 18190.34s]  I don't see a treasure.
[18190.34s -> 18190.82s]  Oh, I do.
[18191.46s -> 18192.69s]  100 gold.
[18192.69s -> 18193.09s]  Let's go.
[18193.73s -> 18196.04s]  Give me a good spawn.
[18196.04s -> 18198.52s]  You truly are an idiot, aren't you?
[18201.48s -> 18215.59s]  Die.
[18218.45s -> 18219.17s]  71.
[18220.74s -> 18223.54s]  What did I just get?
[18224.82s -> 18225.78s]  20 gold return.
[18233.89s -> 18234.93s]  21 gold return.
[18236.48s -> 18238.16s]  And I lost five health or something.
[18238.16s -> 18239.12s]  Not worth it.
[18239.12s -> 18249.97s]  Use this.
[18249.97s -> 18251.72s]  If you dash shoots a gust,
[18252.52s -> 18255.48s]  10 stacks of chill cause a blast clearing the effect.
[18256.04s -> 18257.48s]  While all foals are chilled,
[18263.80s -> 18265.56s]  they are 10% slower and decayed.
[18266.12s -> 18269.25s]  K damage.
[18270.18s -> 18270.66s]  So I just...
[18271.38s -> 18272.79s]  And they all get chilled anyways.
[18273.35s -> 18274.66s]  Sounds good.
[18278.71s -> 18284.84s]  It just adds to the potential.
[18286.60s -> 18286.84s]  All right.
[18286.84s -> 18293.11s]  Am I going to get the harder mech again?
[18293.91s -> 18303.44s]  Damn.
[18303.44s -> 18303.92s]  Wait.
[18303.92s -> 18304.88s]  This is a different mech.
[18307.52s -> 18309.25s]  How many mechs are there?
[18324.23s -> 18325.99s]  Somebody said step on me.
[18337.46s -> 18342.80s]  First thing you write.
[18343.75s -> 18343.99s]  It's just...
[18346.10s -> 18347.30s]  Oh, who's this new god?
[18347.30s -> 18348.26s]  Who's this new character?
[18348.26s -> 18348.74s]  Oh, I don't know.
[18348.74s -> 18349.38s]  Step on me.
[18349.94s -> 18359.40s]  What's this rage?
[18359.40s -> 18360.52s]  She's got a rage meter?
[18361.48s -> 18367.20s]  What exactly does that mean?
[18378.69s -> 18380.53s]  Well, you're not nearly as bad as the other one.
[18381.25s -> 18385.76s]  Can I stop her from doing that?
[18386.40s -> 18408.18s]  She's impervious.
[18421.35s -> 18422.79s]  These traps have blended in with the ground.
[18422.79s -> 18423.83s]  They're the same...
[18423.83s -> 18427.67s]  I've only taken damage from the fucking traps on the ground.
[18436.07s -> 18438.63s]  I was stepping on the area that was...
[18438.95s -> 18440.79s]  I was avoiding the actual ground.
[18450.84s -> 18451.40s]  I got plenty of health.
[18451.40s -> 18451.96s]  I'm fine.
[18451.96s -> 18454.08s]  Good build.
[18454.08s -> 18458.84s]  I'm going to step on me.
[18458.84s -> 18474.68s]  Can I ask you guys what element I was?
[18474.68s -> 18476.61s]  What element am I?
[18476.61s -> 18477.65s]  I know what animal I am.
[18477.65s -> 18482.10s]  One of those fucking parrots that you see at the pet store.
[18482.10s -> 18487.24s]  Not even the cool one.
[18487.24s -> 18493.19s]  The one that just yells out the thing that you just said.
[18493.19s -> 18505.24s]  Like a parakeet.
[18505.24s -> 18506.60s]  Yeah, it makes sense, right?
[18506.60s -> 18509.68s]  Look at half of my mannerisms.
[18509.68s -> 18513.78s]  Just like, step on me, bro.
[18513.78s -> 18521.12s]  Just say the shit that you're writing.
[18521.12s -> 18525.80s]  Figured it out.
[18525.80s -> 18534.92s]  All right.
[18534.92s -> 18536.60s]  It's time to change to...
[18537.24s -> 18539.14s]  I feel like this is a good run, though.
[18540.10s -> 18541.62s]  The meta is too good.
[18541.62s -> 18543.38s]  The run is too good.
[18543.38s -> 18544.58s]  I can't change it.
[18544.58s -> 18547.17s]  Don't stop hating yourself.
[18547.17s -> 18547.89s]  I don't hate myself.
[18547.89s -> 18549.01s]  Parrots are incredibly intelligent.
[18549.01s -> 18550.61s]  They're really cool and they're really fun.
[18550.61s -> 18553.22s]  I didn't say parrots were stupid.
[18553.22s -> 18553.70s]  They're bad.
[18554.50s -> 18566.34s]  I'm keeping the tooth on.
[18566.34s -> 18566.98s]  This run's good.
[18568.26s -> 18581.78s]  If it's going to happen tonight, it's going to happen right now.
[18581.78s -> 18582.50s]  Why is it locked?
[18583.75s -> 18584.95s]  Let me back in there.
[18584.95s -> 18585.59s]  Let me back in there.
[18585.59s -> 18586.23s]  Let me back in there.
[18586.87s -> 18589.28s]  They lock it after you equip something?
[18593.73s -> 18594.53s]  That's unfortunate.
[18595.17s -> 18610.21s]  What up, my fellow germites?
[18610.21s -> 18611.09s]  You forgot to add the A.
[18611.73s -> 18612.93s]  It's germimites.
[18616.04s -> 18617.96s]  So you can't just get free money from the purse.
[18617.96s -> 18619.16s]  Oh, that makes sense.
[18619.16s -> 18629.00s]  Oh, my granite.
[18629.64s -> 18636.16s]  Oh, my granite.
[18636.16s -> 18651.28s]  It's a good build.
[18651.28s -> 18652.40s]  And I got good health, too.
[18653.04s -> 18654.82s]  This is going to work out pretty well, I think.
[18655.62s -> 18668.88s]  What do we got?
[18668.88s -> 18670.80s]  Your special is stronger and does chill.
[18670.80s -> 18675.36s]  Your cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog.
[18675.36s -> 18676.00s]  Which one?
[18676.80s -> 18678.20s]  One or two.
[18678.20s -> 18678.92s]  One or two.
[18678.92s -> 18679.48s]  They're both good.
[18682.15s -> 18683.35s]  Although this is probably better.
[18684.15s -> 18686.76s]  Pretty good lobs lock.
[18696.02s -> 18696.74s]  Can I interact with this?
[18701.12s -> 18702.64s]  Money or Poseidon?
[18703.73s -> 18704.53s]  Probably Poseidon.
[18718.18s -> 18718.90s]  Get away from me.
[18720.64s -> 18721.12s]  Get away.
[18725.51s -> 18726.31s]  Get away.
[18726.31s -> 18737.60s]  It's good.
[18738.24s -> 18739.76s]  It's working out pretty well.
[18740.56s -> 18741.84s]  Dad, I'm coming for you.
[18741.84s -> 18747.38s]  There's a certain chill about you.
[18747.38s -> 18751.86s]  Received an ice cold blessing courtesy of Elder Goddess Demeter, correct?
[18752.58s -> 18756.10s]  Now, firstly, I think water's best in liquid form, but who am I to judge?
[18756.66s -> 18758.66s]  Push high.
[18760.48s -> 18762.48s]  Attack deals more damage and knocks people away.
[18762.48s -> 18764.08s]  That's just that's just great.
[18764.08s -> 18766.66s]  Here is that's good, too, though.
[18768.47s -> 18774.39s]  It's more insane explosive damage or have a call that makes me invincible.
[18778.88s -> 18781.20s]  Or just a huge amount of rewards.
[18781.20s -> 18782.00s]  These are all good.
[18782.00s -> 18782.72s]  I don't know what to do.
[18799.40s -> 18800.28s]  And I'm taking the call.
[18802.12s -> 18805.52s]  Fishing time then.
[18805.52s -> 18811.68s]  Too early.
[18811.68s -> 18813.27s]  How is that too early?
[18815.36s -> 18817.20s]  Just bobbed and I hit.
[18817.20s -> 18818.64s]  That was late, if anything.
[18819.20s -> 18820.40s]  How was it too early?
[18820.40s -> 18851.92s]  You guys are jumpy.
[18861.43s -> 18862.23s]  Bow is best.
[18862.23s -> 18862.87s]  Bow and shield.
[18862.87s -> 18864.31s]  I like bow better than shield.
[18864.31s -> 18870.08s]  I keep I know I change my mind every single run, but I mean, I love the bow.
[18870.08s -> 18888.61s]  Just does it for me.
[18888.61s -> 18889.25s]  Perfect.
[18889.25s -> 18896.29s]  Dad, every weapon is good.
[18896.29s -> 18896.77s]  You're bad.
[18897.65s -> 18898.53s]  Oh, arguments.
[18899.09s -> 18900.61s]  Fighting in the chat room.
[18900.61s -> 18912.15s]  That's not a bad trade.
[18912.15s -> 18914.69s]  I'll just take that's a 20.
[18914.69s -> 18916.45s]  That's nothing for 10 gems.
[18917.25s -> 18925.60s]  I know people are going to say, look, you could have.
[18925.60s -> 18926.24s]  I couldn't have bought it.
[18926.24s -> 18926.96s]  I couldn't afford it.
[18928.20s -> 18928.76s]  Aphrodite.
[18929.48s -> 18933.68s]  Time for the chat bar fight.
[18965.41s -> 18968.71s]  Crush me.
[18968.71s -> 18969.19s]  Where am I?
[18973.84s -> 18975.04s]  I just stopped freaking out.
[18983.30s -> 18984.26s]  Did you go into the lava?
[18984.26s -> 18985.30s]  What happened?
[18985.30s -> 18991.22s]  I kind of want to give Aphrodite another gift.
[18991.22s -> 18993.48s]  I'm going to do it.
[18993.48s -> 19004.07s]  My lady Aphrodite, if not for our acquaintance, I'm certain that my days or nights would be
[19004.07s -> 19005.19s]  much drearier indeed.
[19007.76s -> 19011.08s]  Dearest, such a wonderfully thoughtful gift for me.
[19011.88s -> 19013.64s]  I love it and I would be lying if I said you shouldn't have.
[19013.64s -> 19015.64s]  Romancing Aphrodite.
[19018.64s -> 19023.44s]  I got a, oh, another one.
[19024.00s -> 19025.28s]  Wait, how much more stuff do you want?
[19026.74s -> 19030.55s]  One, two, three, four more hearts.
[19030.55s -> 19033.19s]  And then you talk two more hearts and you'll talk to me again.
[19036.48s -> 19037.12s]  What?
[19037.12s -> 19038.72s]  You know how hard these are to get?
[19038.72s -> 19046.24s]  Air is beautiful and brisk.
[19046.24s -> 19047.44s]  The garden's lush.
[19047.44s -> 19049.04s]  The feasting plentiful.
[19049.04s -> 19052.32s]  Why, it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed.
[19058.40s -> 19059.20s]  That's not bad.
[19063.19s -> 19064.07s]  I mean, that's just 13%.
[19064.87s -> 19065.59s]  Why not just do it?
[19066.31s -> 19068.29s]  Revenge damage is good too.
[19068.29s -> 19074.04s]  Do it.
[19074.04s -> 19077.09s]  Pomegranate time.
[19080.53s -> 19081.49s]  Grow up, Jerma.
[19082.29s -> 19084.74s]  I'm what?
[19084.74s -> 19090.34s]  I'm pretending to romance a woman in a video game that has like a romance feature.
[19090.34s -> 19091.78s]  I'm just playing the video game.
[19091.78s -> 19093.46s]  This is the intended feature of the video game.
[19094.98s -> 19121.24s]  Get over here.
[19122.04s -> 19126.88s]  Into the water with you.
[19129.44s -> 19129.92s]  Oh, shit.
[19130.56s -> 19133.19s]  Mini Medusa heads.
[19148.32s -> 19148.96s]  Shit.
[19148.96s -> 19149.68s]  Wasn't fast enough.
[19150.32s -> 19160.13s]  What's going on with my screen?
[19160.13s -> 19160.61s]  You see that?
[19161.25s -> 19164.34s]  That's weird.
[19167.00s -> 19167.88s]  What's going on with my screen?
[19168.60s -> 19172.08s]  It's like going black for a second.
[19172.08s -> 19175.04s]  It's like dipping black, dipping black, dipping black.
[19175.04s -> 19176.29s]  It's a smoke effect?
[19176.29s -> 19176.53s]  Oh.
[19177.17s -> 19180.47s]  Even more damage from the fog.
[19181.72s -> 19182.36s]  Super call.
[19183.41s -> 19187.01s]  Or a 16% reduction in all damage.
[19187.57s -> 19206.50s]  Yeah, it's between these two, I think.
[19214.42s -> 19214.98s]  I, yeah.
[19215.54s -> 19216.82s]  I gotta get better at hitting it though.
[19217.46s -> 19220.71s]  Ooh, Aphrodite and Dionysus.
[19221.35s -> 19221.99s]  Or Pomegranate.
[19221.99s -> 19222.87s]  Yeah, don't here.
[19222.87s -> 19223.75s]  We want upgrades.
[19228.05s -> 19229.01s]  Cast ignores armor.
[19229.01s -> 19229.65s]  Yeah, that's good too.
[19230.61s -> 19233.60s]  Who's favorite to choose?
[19237.99s -> 19238.71s]  Yeah, man.
[19238.71s -> 19239.75s]  You know what it's all about.
[19243.54s -> 19245.30s]  Using a fountain restores all your health
[19245.30s -> 19247.30s]  and gives you bonus damage per fountain.
[19247.30s -> 19249.11s]  That's good stuff.
[19254.71s -> 19256.39s]  Surely there's no way that could have been
[19256.39s -> 19258.55s]  one of the wiser choices that you've lately made.
[19262.77s -> 19264.13s]  Lady Aphrodite, I'm sorry.
[19264.93s -> 19266.29s]  My dear Aphrodite.
[19266.29s -> 19267.41s]  I'm so sorry, my queen.
[19268.13s -> 19269.20s]  I'm so sorry.
[19270.16s -> 19271.65s]  I'll never do it again, I swear.
[19272.37s -> 19295.97s]  Get away from me.
[19295.97s -> 19297.17s]  Stop doing the hearts thing.
[19297.81s -> 19301.41s]  Get away.
[19301.97s -> 19314.36s]  Get out of here.
[19314.36s -> 19314.84s]  Into the fire.
[19325.48s -> 19326.12s]  Cool.
[19326.12s -> 19328.08s]  Didn't take that much damage for a double.
[19328.08s -> 19329.04s]  I'm happy with that.
[19329.04s -> 19337.30s]  Just do not anger me again
[19337.30s -> 19339.64s]  or I'm gonna kill you there myself.
[19339.64s -> 19342.69s]  Bro, just accept her love, bro.
[19342.69s -> 19343.19s]  Calm down.
[19355.12s -> 19357.04s]  And it's a heart that flies out now.
[19357.76s -> 19364.69s]  I don't have enough money to buy maybe health.
[19365.25s -> 19370.16s]  Maybe try to get attack speed with Murmys?
[19370.80s -> 19381.65s]  Yeah, this is, this is free.
[19381.65s -> 19383.94s]  This is a fountain?
[19384.50s -> 19388.04s]  Why is this just for free?
[19388.04s -> 19394.45s]  All too quickly for you, boss.
[19394.45s -> 19396.02s]  Way nice as it doesn't.
[19396.02s -> 19397.06s]  As you're probably aware,
[19397.06s -> 19398.10s]  there's quite a feast though.
[19401.46s -> 19402.10s]  Move speed.
[19402.82s -> 19404.34s]  Your special is faster.
[19408.20s -> 19416.15s]  Hmm, that's just, yeah.
[19417.19s -> 19418.88s]  And here we go.
[19418.88s -> 19420.16s]  Just move a little bit faster.
[19420.16s -> 19420.64s]  That's fine.
[19421.92s -> 19425.52s]  All right, let's fight this boss.
[19435.96s -> 19436.92s]  No one gets hurt.
[19449.24s -> 19450.36s]  I mean, look at this damage.
[19451.24s -> 19451.96s]  It's unheard of.
[19452.68s -> 19456.50s]  Hey, bring out your little friends.
[19457.22s -> 19471.76s]  Shit, I missed it.
[19472.32s -> 19493.40s]  Just long shot it, man.
[19493.40s -> 19495.24s]  And here we go.
[19506.32s -> 19514.02s]  Okay, now let's do the, get out.
[19514.66s -> 19515.30s]  Throw yourself.
[19534.10s -> 19534.58s]  Shit.
[19534.58s -> 19535.30s]  Oh, fuck.
[19535.30s -> 19536.02s]  I'm taking a lot of damage.
[19536.02s -> 19536.42s]  This is bad.
[19559.70s -> 19560.34s]  Okay, we're good.
[19576.72s -> 19579.17s]  Oh, I want to end it on a, hi.
[19579.97s -> 19582.69s]  He's going to choke?
[19582.69s -> 19588.10s]  No, I'm not going to choke.
[19588.10s -> 19589.62s]  Choking is for the third boss fight,
[19589.62s -> 19590.90s]  not for the second one.
[19590.90s -> 19593.01s]  For safekeeping.
[19593.01s -> 19600.16s]  Did I miss anything?
[19600.72s -> 19612.02s]  Fountain, this is a full heal
[19612.02s -> 19614.34s]  and it's plus 3% damage permanently, right?
[19614.34s -> 19616.04s]  That's pretty awesome.
[19616.84s -> 19627.43s]  That's pretty good too.
[19628.15s -> 19630.58s]  I'm only 20 gold?
[19630.58s -> 19631.89s]  I'm taking it.
[19641.88s -> 19643.08s]  Save the money, save the money.
[19643.08s -> 19643.48s]  Well, I'm good.
[19644.20s -> 19650.18s]  Yeah, whatever happens here,
[19650.18s -> 19651.06s]  this is going to be the end.
[19651.06s -> 19654.39s]  I'll see you tomorrow for chat's choice after this.
[19654.39s -> 19656.13s]  We'll go back to this.
[19658.05s -> 19658.85s]  Maybe I'll just beat it.
[19658.85s -> 19660.77s]  You know, let's just, let's just beat it today.
[19660.77s -> 19661.65s]  Let's beat it right now.
[19661.65s -> 19662.77s]  This is the run to beat it.
[19662.77s -> 19663.49s]  I'm going to go for it.
[19667.09s -> 19667.49s]  Hammer.
[19668.13s -> 19682.64s]  Why did I, that was a weird throw.
[19682.64s -> 19696.96s]  I'm having so much fun.
[19696.96s -> 19698.32s]  I'm having so much fun.
[19698.32s -> 19701.11s]  I'm having so much fun.
[19721.54s -> 19722.58s]  I'm having so much fun.
[19728.08s -> 19730.56s]  Oh, all righty then.
[19736.18s -> 19738.28s]  How far away is far away?
[19738.28s -> 19741.76s]  Because that will kill almost every single enemy
[19741.76s -> 19743.04s]  in the game in one hit.
[19743.04s -> 19750.02s]  What do I do?
[19750.02s -> 19759.38s]  Hey, my mouse is being stupid.
[19759.38s -> 19760.66s]  I mean, it's that.
[19760.66s -> 19763.14s]  Your attack fire is two shots side by side,
[19763.14s -> 19769.72s]  but reduce damage only applies to distant foes, right?
[19770.36s -> 19772.02s]  But how far is distant?
[19782.55s -> 19783.43s]  Reduce range.
[19784.55s -> 19788.58s]  But okay, so this is double damage.
[19791.92s -> 19796.20s]  This is more, this is two times.
[19796.20s -> 19805.01s]  I made my decision.
[19805.01s -> 19808.05s]  That's it.
[19808.05s -> 19808.85s]  Holy shit.
[19808.85s -> 19809.57s]  It's two.
[19810.21s -> 19817.67s]  That's going to be insane though.
[19818.31s -> 19822.63s]  You want to know the best part about this?
[19823.43s -> 19826.23s]  I don't even have to worry about charging the whole thing.
[19827.67s -> 19829.75s]  Just get it and move around.
[19829.75s -> 19830.71s]  Land the perfect shot.
[19830.71s -> 19831.99s]  Land the shot you know you can land.
[19831.99s -> 19832.31s]  Get out.
[19833.03s -> 19840.07s]  Test it.
[19843.00s -> 19845.09s]  Am I there?
[19845.65s -> 19846.77s]  No, not you there.
[19851.91s -> 19852.47s]  You there.
[19853.19s -> 19859.32s]  I don't, I'm overwhelmed.
[19859.88s -> 19861.83s]  Useless.
[19870.12s -> 19870.76s]  You there.
[19871.48s -> 19873.94s]  That's all right.
[19873.94s -> 19885.96s]  I don't know why I think that's funny.
[19885.96s -> 19886.46s]  You up?
[19888.87s -> 19889.19s]  All right.
[19889.19s -> 19889.83s]  I got to play.
[19889.83s -> 19890.39s]  I got to play.
[19890.39s -> 19890.89s]  I got to play.
[19892.69s -> 19893.19s]  You up.
[19896.10s -> 19898.02s]  That's 500 damage, man.
[19898.58s -> 19899.78s]  Holy shit.
[19899.78s -> 19901.54s]  That's 700 damage.
[19903.64s -> 19904.52s]  You ain't got nothing.
[19905.32s -> 19908.29s]  This is game over if I don't act like a dumb ass.
[19910.52s -> 19911.24s]  Hey, you there.
[19911.88s -> 19913.00s]  Are you there, man?
[19913.80s -> 19930.60s]  Hey, don't.
[19930.60s -> 19944.90s]  This is a super boss killer.
[19944.90s -> 19958.47s]  And we have another opportunity for Hermes for increased super damage speed.
[19958.47s -> 19959.03s]  Oh, shit.
[19959.03s -> 19959.51s]  That was bad.
[19960.07s -> 19972.66s]  This is so good.
[19972.66s -> 19973.38s]  I can't blow this.
[20011.00s -> 20012.20s]  Get out of here, you little mutant.
[20014.82s -> 20015.54s]  All right, Hermes.
[20016.66s -> 20017.30s]  Bail me out here.
[20019.94s -> 20022.76s]  You attack it 10% faster.
[20023.40s -> 20024.36s]  Charge more.
[20025.00s -> 20047.11s]  Got to survive, man.
[20048.07s -> 20051.14s]  I got to survive, man.
[20051.14s -> 20052.42s]  I got to survive, man.
[20052.42s -> 20053.62s]  I've got to survive, man.
[20053.62s -> 20054.10s]  I have to.
[20055.06s -> 20056.82s]  I don't the attack speed.
[20057.38s -> 20058.50s]  Is that really that big of a deal?
[20058.50s -> 20060.90s]  Because it's not charge speed.
[20060.90s -> 20065.16s]  It's just how fast I draw the bow, right?
[20065.80s -> 20068.04s]  But that's OK.
[20068.60s -> 20069.56s]  10% is nothing.
[20071.59s -> 20073.99s]  Having the third dash is a major deal.
[20073.99s -> 20074.23s]  Don't worry.
[20074.23s -> 20075.27s]  We're going to get something else right here.
[20081.83s -> 20084.66s]  Look, it's already OK.
[20089.89s -> 20091.73s]  Sidon's aid got leveled up to level one.
[20092.29s -> 20094.68s]  There we go.
[20095.24s -> 20107.54s]  Your dash damage disposed in an area.
[20108.61s -> 20110.93s]  Your boons with knock away also rupture.
[20111.49s -> 20114.92s]  Victim takes damage while moving.
[20116.50s -> 20118.02s]  Does the explosive count as a rupture?
[20118.58s -> 20121.48s]  I need a dash.
[20123.35s -> 20124.23s]  Yeah, I need it.
[20124.23s -> 20124.71s]  It's true.
[20125.43s -> 20126.72s]  I do need a dash.
[20126.72s -> 20127.04s]  You're right.
[20142.34s -> 20142.66s]  OK.
[20145.57s -> 20145.89s]  Fish?
[20145.89s -> 20146.05s]  No.
[20152.32s -> 20152.80s]  Dementor.
[20163.56s -> 20170.12s]  That's so much fucking damage, man.
[20170.12s -> 20170.68s]  It really is.
[20182.39s -> 20184.15s]  It's so much damage.
[20184.79s -> 20186.87s]  Hey, where'd you come from?
[20187.51s -> 20194.08s]  All right.
[20194.08s -> 20194.72s]  This is bad.
[20194.72s -> 20195.12s]  Hold on.
[20214.52s -> 20216.12s]  Get that shit off my body.
[20216.12s -> 20232.71s]  Who else?
[20232.71s -> 20240.60s]  It took a lot of damage for that.
[20246.36s -> 20249.52s]  Like 10 chill stacks causes a blast effect.
[20249.52s -> 20250.56s]  Any health.
[20250.56s -> 20251.92s]  Yeah, it's time.
[20251.92s -> 20252.40s]  I need this.
[20252.96s -> 20254.15s]  While you have no...
[20254.15s -> 20254.39s]  What?
[20255.03s -> 20261.33s]  While you have no...
[20261.97s -> 20263.59s]  So throw out the...
[20263.59s -> 20264.63s]  Oh, no, that's not good.
[20264.63s -> 20266.87s]  Because that doesn't synergize with what I have.
[20266.87s -> 20276.77s]  Doesn't synergize with what I have.
[20278.53s -> 20279.17s]  Don't I have the thing?
[20279.17s -> 20279.97s]  Because look.
[20279.97s -> 20281.49s]  It's just going to recharge it in three seconds.
[20282.13s -> 20283.70s]  I have it again.
[20283.70s -> 20290.98s]  I mean, if I had the other one right,
[20290.98s -> 20293.22s]  I'd throw it out and I just don't use the casting again.
[20293.22s -> 20294.34s]  I can go around and do more damage.
[20294.34s -> 20297.86s]  So I'm just going to get the crystal back.
[20299.72s -> 20299.96s]  OK.
[20301.00s -> 20311.08s]  I'm going to say money because I can get a boon before the boss.
[20312.68s -> 20313.64s]  Sidon is better.
[20313.64s -> 20313.88s]  Sure.
[20321.65s -> 20323.33s]  Well, that was a really good choice.
[20323.33s -> 20324.69s]  I don't know how you guys knew that was going to happen,
[20324.69s -> 20325.73s]  but I just got more damage.
[20328.16s -> 20329.84s]  How did you guys know that was going to happen?
[20340.90s -> 20341.54s]  I'm the dev.
[20341.54s -> 20342.10s]  Oh, OK.
[20350.13s -> 20358.34s]  That's one.
[20359.81s -> 20361.33s]  Slamming foes into barriers.
[20362.29s -> 20363.09s]  I don't even know how...
[20363.09s -> 20363.81s]  How do I do that?
[20364.45s -> 20366.66s]  How do I slam?
[20367.46s -> 20372.68s]  If I dash into them?
[20373.40s -> 20374.28s]  Three.
[20374.28s -> 20375.40s]  It's too late for one.
[20377.41s -> 20377.89s]  I'm just going to...
[20377.89s -> 20378.05s]  OK.
[20378.05s -> 20378.93s]  I'm pulling slot machine.
[20395.03s -> 20395.19s]  Good.
[20395.19s -> 20396.39s]  You've got breakfast wraps.
[20405.75s -> 20407.27s]  Pretty pog if you ask me.
[20407.27s -> 20424.36s]  Good timing on that one.
[20424.92s -> 20426.04s]  Good timing on that one.
[20426.60s -> 20431.51s]  This shit bounces around.
[20431.51s -> 20431.91s]  Not fair.
[20432.71s -> 20448.60s]  I would call that a clean room.
[20448.60s -> 20454.96s]  I'd call that a clean room.
[20454.96s -> 20461.43s]  Even more health.
[20462.87s -> 20464.47s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20464.47s -> 20465.03s]  Even more health.
[20482.56s -> 20483.20s]  Eat shit.
[20483.92s -> 20489.08s]  Don't let the little bulbs get away.
[20489.88s -> 20493.83s]  Wait, just let them come to me.
[20493.83s -> 20494.39s]  Let them come to me.
[20494.63s -> 20495.67s]  What's the point?
[20495.67s -> 20506.10s]  Health is good with this build.
[20506.10s -> 20506.66s]  Yeah, it is.
[20507.30s -> 20513.24s]  Ow.
[20514.10s -> 20514.42s]  Ow.
[20515.14s -> 20523.14s]  Give me a break.
[20523.14s -> 20524.42s]  You're bouncing this shit everywhere.
[20525.06s -> 20525.86s]  You're not even trying.
[20525.86s -> 20527.70s]  You're just spamming in random directions.
[20528.34s -> 20529.97s]  Where are you?
[20530.69s -> 20538.82s]  This is the first time I've ever had 200 health.
[20543.54s -> 20543.86s]  All right.
[20543.86s -> 20544.50s]  Do I want...
[20545.06s -> 20547.43s]  Up the shop.
[20547.43s -> 20550.96s]  Chaos?
[20551.68s -> 20554.74s]  Where?
[20554.74s -> 20561.57s]  You lying?
[20561.57s -> 20562.29s]  Oh.
[20562.29s -> 20571.41s]  All right.
[20571.41s -> 20572.29s]  This is it.
[20572.29s -> 20576.10s]  Here we go.
[20576.10s -> 20592.61s]  I mean, there I have to take three.
[20593.57s -> 20595.25s]  That's just me.
[20595.25s -> 20595.73s]  I just...
[20595.73s -> 20597.17s]  When it's out, I do more damage.
[20597.17s -> 20597.65s]  Take this too.
[20597.65s -> 20598.21s]  Why not?
[20598.21s -> 20599.01s]  Boost to the boon.
[20599.88s -> 20600.76s]  Frost flourish.
[20600.76s -> 20601.56s]  Got upgraded.
[20601.56s -> 20602.28s]  What does that one do?
[20603.00s -> 20614.88s]  Who the hell is it?
[20622.60s -> 20624.12s]  Oh, it's wicked good.
[20624.12s -> 20625.00s]  It's wicked good.
[20625.00s -> 20625.96s]  It's wicked good.
[20625.96s -> 20626.84s]  It's wicked good.
[20626.84s -> 20627.08s]  All right.
[20627.08s -> 20628.12s]  Let's go.
[20628.12s -> 20629.72s]  I'm going to kill that Minotaur.
[20629.72s -> 20631.00s]  I'm going to rip his eyes out.
[20631.00s -> 20648.52s]  You seek to break through to but you shall leave.
[20648.52s -> 20651.64s]  All the equivalent of it here in the splendors of Elysium.
[20651.64s -> 20652.92s]  I'm spamming the bomb.
[20652.92s -> 20654.60s]  I'm going to hit B over and over again.
[20654.60s -> 20656.52s]  Can you leave me with little choice but to make you...
[20656.52s -> 20657.56s]  One, two, three.
[20658.12s -> 20659.16s]  One, two, three.
[20659.16s -> 20660.12s]  Go, go, go.
[20661.16s -> 20695.46s]  Ow.
[20695.46s -> 20711.73s]  That did a little damage to him.
[20737.51s -> 20737.91s]  Come here.
[20739.09s -> 20739.57s]  Come here.
[20740.13s -> 20740.61s]  Come here.
[20745.78s -> 20757.01s]  Where is he?
[20757.01s -> 20757.75s]  Where's the bull?
[20758.31s -> 20770.02s]  Ow, that hurt.
[20770.02s -> 20779.03s]  You fucker.
[20801.22s -> 20801.70s]  Oh, good.
[20801.70s -> 20802.90s]  Somebody just made me laugh.
[20806.07s -> 20806.95s]  Somebody just fucking...
[20806.95s -> 20807.99s]  Why did I look at chat?
[20809.11s -> 20834.21s]  All right.
[20834.21s -> 20834.69s]  This is it.
[20850.85s -> 20854.31s]  You block everything.
[20854.31s -> 20855.19s]  You fucking punk.
[20855.91s -> 20896.64s]  Hey.
[20926.44s -> 20929.24s]  And I got full health and two revives.
[20931.22s -> 20933.22s]  Dad, I'm coming for you now.
[20934.34s -> 20935.38s]  I'm coming for dad.
[20936.26s -> 20939.67s]  I might even have to break out something really important for dad.
[20940.31s -> 20949.14s]  We'll see.
[20949.86s -> 20954.40s]  I'm going to have to whip out something for dad.
[20954.40s -> 20955.92s]  No, I'm something else.
[20958.47s -> 20963.83s]  I'm going to have to whip out...
[20963.83s -> 20966.63s]  I'm going to have to whip out something for you, dad.
[20969.20s -> 20970.96s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[20970.96s -> 20971.44s]  Stop it.
[20973.25s -> 20974.13s]  Oh, my God.
[20974.21s -> 20975.41s]  Why did I say it like that?
[20976.13s -> 20979.70s]  I'm just going to buy this.
[20979.70s -> 20980.66s]  It's 15 bucks.
[20983.49s -> 20983.73s]  All right.
[20983.73s -> 20984.13s]  Let's go.
[20988.77s -> 20989.97s]  I got to be careful.
[20990.61s -> 20993.73s]  I'm going to save Poseidon's explosive.
[20993.73s -> 20994.85s]  Why would you waste your money on that?
[20994.85s -> 20996.69s]  Doesn't that work at dad?
[20997.41s -> 20998.87s]  He did that.
[20998.87s -> 20999.11s]  What?
[20999.75s -> 21001.83s]  Did you swap out the first already?
[21001.83s -> 21002.87s]  I hope so.
[21002.87s -> 21003.11s]  Yeah.
[21003.67s -> 21006.95s]  I'm ready.
[21011.12s -> 21027.20s]  No fish in here, right?
[21029.33s -> 21030.13s]  Oops.
[21030.13s -> 21031.09s]  He just even told me.
[21034.50s -> 21035.14s]  All right.
[21035.14s -> 21035.62s]  What do we got?
[21037.30s -> 21041.11s]  We've got pomegranates, Poseidon.
[21047.91s -> 21049.11s]  Wait, there's a fish in this last...
[21049.11s -> 21049.35s]  Okay.
[21049.35s -> 21050.15s]  I don't want to screw this up.
[21051.11s -> 21053.86s]  So you can get faked out here.
[21054.50s -> 21056.80s]  So wait for the ding.
[21086.40s -> 21087.20s]  So we're going with...
[21087.60s -> 21088.24s]  We're going with...
[21090.79s -> 21105.09s]  Okay.
[21105.09s -> 21105.41s]  That was...
[21105.41s -> 21107.81s]  I kind of had no idea what the hell was going on in this room.
[21107.81s -> 21122.98s]  Good.
[21122.98s -> 21124.08s]  Come on.
[21124.08s -> 21125.12s]  This is the one.
[21125.12s -> 21126.48s]  This is the one.
[21126.56s -> 21127.28s]  This is the run.
[21179.96s -> 21180.82s]  Oh, shit.
[21194.26s -> 21200.72s]  Final room.
[21200.72s -> 21201.28s]  Holy shit.
[21201.28s -> 21202.32s]  Those things fall down.
[21213.19s -> 21214.23s]  No poison.
[21214.23s -> 21215.51s]  Don't get touched by that shit.
[21216.15s -> 21220.34s]  Who's left?
[21221.08s -> 21221.64s]  Oh, you.
[21225.03s -> 21225.27s]  Ding.
[21225.83s -> 21228.72s]  225 health.
[21228.72s -> 21231.30s]  And a shop.
[21235.46s -> 21236.26s]  No, no, no.
[21236.26s -> 21237.06s]  None of it.
[21237.06s -> 21240.28s]  Does it earn?
[21240.28s -> 21255.28s]  I don't have enough money.
[21255.28s -> 21257.09s]  All right.
[21257.09s -> 21258.39s]  Frozen time.
[21258.39s -> 21271.44s]  This is so good.
[21271.44s -> 21272.48s]  It's so much damage.
[21272.48s -> 21273.60s]  It's so wonderful.
[21273.60s -> 21278.84s]  An itchy nose for a second.
[21278.84s -> 21279.56s]  Sorry.
[21279.56s -> 21285.01s]  I had to just rip my hand up and just smack into the microphone.
[21295.44s -> 21296.08s]  Almost got hit.
[21297.86s -> 21298.50s]  Very close.
[21319.91s -> 21320.95s]  700.
[21320.95s -> 21332.10s]  700.
[21332.10s -> 21332.58s]  And out.
[21332.58s -> 21333.30s]  Don't get poisoned.
[21334.10s -> 21339.99s]  Poison.
[21339.99s -> 21340.55s]  I'm poisoned.
[21340.55s -> 21341.19s]  Where's the cure?
[21341.19s -> 21341.75s]  Where's the cure?
[21369.96s -> 21372.60s]  I can feel it in my loins right now.
[21372.60s -> 21373.80s]  Don't say that yet.
[21373.80s -> 21374.44s]  Don't say that.
[21375.72s -> 21376.28s]  What's going on?
[21380.13s -> 21381.89s]  You are so uptight now.
[21381.89s -> 21383.17s]  Just ease up a little there.
[21383.17s -> 21384.53s]  Let's see what we can do.
[21384.53s -> 21385.25s]  Are you gonna duo?
[21387.91s -> 21389.08s]  You're...
[21389.08s -> 21389.56s]  Wait.
[21389.56s -> 21393.33s]  Your cast blasts an area with freezing fog that inflicts chill.
[21393.33s -> 21394.93s]  Plus 30% more damage.
[21394.93s -> 21400.71s]  Wait, what?
[21400.71s -> 21400.95s]  What?
[21403.41s -> 21403.89s]  Teamwork.
[21405.94s -> 21406.34s]  What?
[21409.91s -> 21411.59s]  And it sticks around for a while too.
[21414.47s -> 21414.79s]  Okay.
[21415.43s -> 21417.09s]  All right.
[21417.09s -> 21418.12s]  All right.
[21418.76s -> 21420.02s]  This should be...
[21420.02s -> 21421.78s]  I should make out pretty well here.
[21422.50s -> 21424.82s]  This is the best build I've probably had since playing the game.
[21430.29s -> 21432.13s]  Money or pomegranate?
[21432.45s -> 21443.24s]  Bet it's in here.
[21460.37s -> 21463.81s]  I'm gonna get like quadruple combo'd by dad and somehow.
[21463.81s -> 21464.53s]  It's gonna be like...
[21466.79s -> 21470.16s]  I was in the air the whole time, by the way.
[21470.16s -> 21480.12s]  What's on me?
[21511.20s -> 21511.44s]  No.
[21512.42s -> 21513.22s]  No.
[21513.22s -> 21513.78s]  No.
[21513.78s -> 21514.02s]  No.
[21514.02s -> 21514.98s]  Does this count for dad?
[21517.17s -> 21517.89s]  No.
[21517.89s -> 21535.01s]  Oops, I missed.
[21535.73s -> 21550.77s]  Holy shit.
[21550.77s -> 21551.97s]  I didn't even know those were there.
[21553.09s -> 21553.97s]  That's good to know.
[21559.68s -> 21560.40s]  Holy shit.
[21561.36s -> 21562.88s]  I was trying to move into a safe spot.
[21571.88s -> 21572.76s]  This room sucks.
[21574.68s -> 21575.56s]  This room sucks.
[21589.48s -> 21590.21s]  Okay.
[21593.86s -> 21596.98s]  Your attack deals more damage and inflicts weak.
[21596.98s -> 21602.48s]  Cast lobs, a larger area, or your call is better.
[21602.48s -> 21606.96s]  Did I do more attack or the cast damage does more?
[21606.96s -> 21607.36s]  Definitely.
[21607.36s -> 21608.48s]  Just let's go straight up damage.
[21609.44s -> 21609.84s]  All right.
[21609.84s -> 21610.96s]  I got two revives.
[21611.60s -> 21612.88s]  Still haven't found the sack, by the way.
[21612.88s -> 21614.08s]  This is kind of unlucky, isn't it?
[21614.80s -> 21618.12s]  This is...
[21618.12s -> 21618.76s]  I need health.
[21632.68s -> 21633.64s]  And I got two more left.
[21633.64s -> 21635.00s]  I'm going to go with money.
[21635.72s -> 21635.96s]  Right?
[21636.52s -> 21637.17s]  All right.
[21637.17s -> 21640.21s]  Do I buy Poseidon right now or pomegranate right now?
[21640.77s -> 21648.39s]  I think you guys are very torn on this.
[21648.95s -> 21657.12s]  Don't spend it all in one place, mate.
[21663.59s -> 21664.23s]  Fog, I think.
[21667.80s -> 21668.20s]  Yep.
[21668.20s -> 21668.52s]  All right.
[21669.59s -> 21670.71s]  I got a heal.
[21670.71s -> 21671.67s]  I need a fountain.
[21672.55s -> 21674.52s]  Give me a fountain here somewhere.
[21675.65s -> 21675.97s]  Money.
[21676.69s -> 21677.89s]  This one, I guess.
[21677.89s -> 21691.94s]  Nope.
[21691.94s -> 21693.22s]  Don't sell anything.
[21693.22s -> 21713.94s]  What?
[21713.94s -> 21714.98s]  A codex update.
[21714.98s -> 21715.54s]  What?
[21715.54s -> 21716.53s]  What?
[21717.33s -> 21718.77s]  Did you hear about this guy?
[21718.77s -> 21720.24s]  He's not even in this room.
[21720.80s -> 21722.00s]  He's cool, though.
[21722.00s -> 21734.44s]  What do we got?
[21742.50s -> 21742.98s]  Boss time.
[21743.54s -> 21757.12s]  This is horrible.
[21763.41s -> 21764.21s]  Holy shit.
[21764.21s -> 21764.93s]  That was horrible.
[21766.24s -> 21767.60s]  I still don't have the...
[21768.24s -> 21771.04s]  Still don't have the sack to give the dog?
[21771.84s -> 21781.56s]  What are you trying to do to me here, game?
[21781.56s -> 21784.12s]  This better be a fountain.
[21794.61s -> 21795.81s]  Buy another palm?
[21795.81s -> 21802.26s]  I don't want to do anvil.
[21802.26s -> 21807.30s]  Anvil scares me a little.
[21807.30s -> 21808.18s]  Anvil scares me.
[21808.18s -> 21813.27s]  I don't want to lose something and gain something.
[21813.27s -> 21814.31s]  Palm is double.
[21814.31s -> 21815.19s]  It's a double palm.
[21815.75s -> 21816.92s]  It's a double...
[21816.92s -> 21818.44s]  Wait, Poseidon has a heal.
[21819.08s -> 21819.88s]  He does.
[21819.88s -> 21821.24s]  But what if I don't get it?
[21821.88s -> 21824.12s]  What if I don't get it?
[21824.76s -> 21827.06s]  Palm is two levels.
[21836.08s -> 21836.80s]  Oh my god.
[21836.80s -> 21837.28s]  What happened?
[21840.76s -> 21841.16s]  Why?
[21843.24s -> 21843.56s]  Why?
[21845.48s -> 21846.68s]  Your call pulls in...
[21847.32s -> 21849.80s]  Your attack and special is stronger in the first 10 seconds.
[21850.44s -> 21854.23s]  Any boons you find are more potent as there's no more.
[21861.99s -> 21865.44s]  Should have done double palm.
[21866.08s -> 21868.34s]  I actually might still be able to do it, depending.
[21868.34s -> 21869.06s]  Because that means...
[21869.06s -> 21869.70s]  Is this going to be...
[21870.50s -> 21871.94s]  Maybe this way.
[21871.94s -> 21881.43s]  Give me some money.
[21881.43s -> 21885.06s]  Doesn't taste like anything.
[21885.06s -> 21886.26s]  Run has been ruined.
[21886.26s -> 21886.66s]  Not yet.
[21887.54s -> 21888.66s]  Man, I might die in here once.
[21888.66s -> 21889.30s]  That's not good.
[21890.10s -> 21898.12s]  Shit, they're everywhere.
[21900.74s -> 21901.30s]  I need money.
[21901.86s -> 21902.26s]  Come on.
[21903.06s -> 21903.62s]  No urns?
[21905.36s -> 21905.92s]  Urns.
[21905.92s -> 21906.48s]  Please.
[21906.48s -> 21906.96s]  Please.
[21906.96s -> 21907.36s]  Urns.
[21908.08s -> 21908.56s]  Tasty.
[21920.69s -> 21921.73s]  200 gold?
[21921.73s -> 21922.37s]  That's not enough.
[21923.49s -> 21924.79s]  Not enough.
[21924.79s -> 21930.31s]  Cerberus must be starving.
[21930.31s -> 21931.19s]  Oh my god.
[21931.19s -> 21932.47s]  Oh my god.
[21932.47s -> 21935.12s]  Cerberus.
[21935.12s -> 21937.41s]  Oh my god.
[21937.41s -> 21938.79s]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[21938.79s -> 21939.19s]  This is the one.
[21939.19s -> 21940.47s]  Unless I accept this message.
[21940.47s -> 21941.35s]  This is the one.
[21941.35s -> 21942.71s]  Your attack deals more damage.
[21942.71s -> 21944.63s]  Plus 53% damage.
[21944.63s -> 21946.47s]  But wait, it replaces what?
[21946.47s -> 21951.92s]  Your boons with knockback also rupture.
[21951.92s -> 21952.88s]  A more rupture.
[21952.88s -> 21960.50s]  I can't...
[21960.50s -> 21962.66s]  I don't want to replace heartbreak strike.
[21962.66s -> 21967.92s]  Who's the only good option?
[21967.92s -> 21973.09s]  Full health, two revives, god build.
[21973.09s -> 21974.05s]  What could go wrong?
[21976.23s -> 21977.51s]  We'll find out soon enough.
[21983.30s -> 21984.58s]  I don't have enough money to buy anything.
[21986.92s -> 21987.72s]  All right, this is it.
[21987.72s -> 21988.12s]  Let's go.
[21994.00s -> 21995.20s]  Don't throw for views.
[21995.20s -> 21996.32s]  Why would I do that, man?
[21996.32s -> 21997.60s]  Okay, I'm not going to do...
[21997.60s -> 21998.80s]  I'm not going to throw for views.
[21998.80s -> 22000.08s]  Have you seen how I've been playing?
[22000.08s -> 22001.04s]  I'm not just throwing.
[22001.04s -> 22002.16s]  I'm not like walking off a cliff.
[22002.16s -> 22003.68s]  I'm not throwing for views.
[22003.68s -> 22006.68s]  Plus, why would we throw for views?
[22006.68s -> 22010.28s]  Like, like 2,000 people have left by tonight.
[22010.28s -> 22010.92s]  By right now.
[22011.96s -> 22014.92s]  Am I going to go die now and be like whoopsie-hee-hee?
[22014.92s -> 22017.68s]  I should have done that four hours ago.
[22019.62s -> 22020.74s]  All right, let's go.
[22020.74s -> 22021.30s]  This is it.
[22021.30s -> 22021.78s]  This is it.
[22021.78s -> 22022.50s]  Just relax.
[22022.50s -> 22023.22s]  Just relax.
[22023.22s -> 22023.86s]  I'm good.
[22023.86s -> 22031.57s]  Antic Cerberus accepts the prince's foul offering.
[22031.57s -> 22032.21s]  It's just regular.
[22032.21s -> 22032.85s]  It's just a normal...
[22032.85s -> 22034.13s]  It's a regular video game.
[22034.13s -> 22035.33s]  And just you get to kill the boss.
[22035.33s -> 22035.83s]  That's it.
[22036.90s -> 22037.70s]  I'm not going to look at chat.
[22037.70s -> 22038.20s]  I'm not.
[22040.96s -> 22041.20s]  All right.
[22041.20s -> 22041.76s]  Come on, dad.
[22041.76s -> 22042.16s]  Let's go.
[22042.80s -> 22045.60s]  Just always keep your cast out.
[22046.24s -> 22048.13s]  Move around.
[22048.69s -> 22050.31s]  Take a bunch of less damage.
[22050.31s -> 22051.43s]  Just get the shots in.
[22052.23s -> 22053.40s]  Just be...
[22053.40s -> 22054.12s]  Just do it.
[22054.68s -> 22060.04s]  Hide behind the pillars during the lasers.
[22060.68s -> 22062.44s]  I hope I remember that.
[22062.44s -> 22064.58s]  I hope I don't forget that.
[22064.58s -> 22067.80s]  I'm looking for full first phase without take...
[22067.80s -> 22070.52s]  Without using one of my lives.
[22070.52s -> 22073.48s]  All right, let's go.
[22073.48s -> 22075.16s]  I feel like I got to get the cords off.
[22075.16s -> 22092.53s]  It was a time when Cerberus would never have permitted any soul to exit.
[22092.53s -> 22097.81s]  What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause.
[22097.81s -> 22098.69s]  Oh, that can possibly be true.
[22098.69s -> 22099.41s]  Just for you.
[22099.41s -> 22105.01s]  What about Orpheus, Theseus, Hercules, Odysseus, Calvus, Tails, or these men delving into the...
[22105.01s -> 22106.61s]  They left on my authority alone.
[22106.61s -> 22110.69s]  If there's a situation that does not apply to you, just listen.
[22110.69s -> 22113.01s]  You believe you are entitled simply to walk out there.
[22113.01s -> 22116.13s]  DMCA from cheers to you don't think that's going to happen.
[22116.13s -> 22116.37s]  Let's go.
[22116.37s -> 22118.32s]  So sit back.
[22118.32s -> 22118.96s]  Get ready.
[22120.84s -> 22121.96s]  Here it comes.
[22123.00s -> 22146.96s]  We don't want to think you're the one who steps up and gets things done around us.
[22146.96s -> 22149.04s]  And then you go the extra mile.
[22150.32s -> 22155.72s]  You're doing a great job.
[22155.72s -> 22157.24s]  A great job.
[22165.27s -> 22166.15s]  We'll tell them.
[22168.79s -> 22170.79s]  Job.
[22174.37s -> 22174.93s]  Slow down.
[22174.93s -> 22223.81s]  He's coming back.
[22223.81s -> 22224.29s]  I can tell.
[22233.38s -> 22237.96s]  We want to tell you that we have faith in you and we know you can do it.
[22242.15s -> 22247.35s]  We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your heart desires.
[22250.26s -> 22258.31s]  That dream you're going, that career you want, that recognition you're seeing, it is yours.
[22259.27s -> 22263.76s]  Just listen.
[22263.76s -> 22265.12s]  Everyone agrees.
[22266.00s -> 22270.84s]  We're on your side.
[22271.56s -> 22272.76s]  We're here for you.
[22273.56s -> 22274.76s]  We believe in you.
[22277.91s -> 22280.39s]  We believe in you.
[22339.68s -> 22351.62s]  No matter what has ever happened in my life, you have always been there for me.
[22352.26s -> 22356.08s]  And that's the greatest gift anyone could ever receive.
[22356.96s -> 22359.28s]  The greatest gift anyone could ever give.
[22360.64s -> 22367.67s]  You've got the biggest heart of anyone I know.
[22369.19s -> 22372.71s]  Look of love in the dictionary and there's your picture.
[22385.11s -> 22386.55s]  Thank you, my friend.
[22388.15s -> 22392.85s]  I can't even hear what they're saying.
[22393.49s -> 22394.85s]  The crowd is too loud.
[22397.17s -> 22398.61s]  The crowd's too loud.
[22400.74s -> 22401.78s]  Come on, say it.
[22416.64s -> 22417.76s]  All right, the crowd's dying down.
[22417.76s -> 22420.93s]  The Cerberus is doing very well.
[22420.93s -> 22422.95s]  Cerberus is doing very well.
[22422.95s -> 22423.19s]  Good.
[22427.14s -> 22428.10s]  We did it.
[22428.10s -> 22428.82s]  Hooray.
[22428.82s -> 22431.06s]  I beat the game on normal difficulty.
[22431.06s -> 22431.62s]  Wow.
[22431.62s -> 22432.58s]  What excitement.
[22440.05s -> 22441.81s]  That build was, it's so good though.
[22442.37s -> 22445.51s]  Many favors here.
[22445.51s -> 22448.39s]  They'll answer me one question and I'll give it some thought.
[22448.39s -> 22449.35s]  How's that?
[22449.35s -> 22451.35s]  I thought I was going to choke at the end there.
[22451.35s -> 22455.12s]  When I took the second death, I was like, I'm dead.
[22455.12s -> 22458.08s]  I was like, no, because he only had like 60% health left.
[22458.08s -> 22459.28s]  I was like, what if I'm going to die here?
[22459.92s -> 22468.05s]  Ask it anyway.
[22468.05s -> 22469.57s]  I'll just do that nine more times.
[22469.57s -> 22470.07s]  Okay.
[22474.26s -> 22476.02s]  Thank you, Pattycake, for the 20 community subs.
[22476.02s -> 22477.06s]  That's an insane amount of money.
[22478.13s -> 22479.81s]  And Daddy Warbucks with five.
[22479.81s -> 22480.31s]  Thank you, guys.
[22481.01s -> 22484.56s]  For Stephanie, your mother.
[22484.56s -> 22485.36s]  Oh, we're getting lore here.
[22485.36s -> 22485.68s]  Hold on.
[22485.68s -> 22486.56s]  Why did she leave?
[22487.20s -> 22501.97s]  Because she escaped.
[22502.61s -> 22503.11s]  What?
[22505.25s -> 22506.05s]  Made it.
[22506.05s -> 22506.55s]  Barely.
[22507.41s -> 22508.77s]  Oh, this is like, hey, you did it.
[22509.83s -> 22511.59s]  Clear time, 56 minutes.
[22511.59s -> 22512.31s]  New record.
[22513.65s -> 22515.49s]  Current streak, one.
[22515.49s -> 22517.41s]  Best streak, one.
[22517.41s -> 22519.59s]  Total clear, one.
[22522.64s -> 22523.14s]  Hooray.
[22529.49s -> 22530.21s]  Well, here it is.
[22531.33s -> 22533.81s]  I got a lot of things to spend, too.
[22533.81s -> 22536.45s]  Ah, that was hard but fun.
[22536.45s -> 22538.95s]  This build was disgusting.
[22538.95s -> 22541.70s]  That's the only reason why I beat it.
[22541.70s -> 22542.20s]  Very cool.
[22542.66s -> 22544.04s]  Now what?
[22545.17s -> 22555.97s]  Oh, you know what was the big run saver here?
[22555.97s -> 22557.99s]  The double.
[22557.99s -> 22559.89s]  Shooting two of these together.
[22560.45s -> 22562.18s]  Just too good.
[22565.54s -> 22566.04s]  Ish, no.
[22568.23s -> 22568.73s]  Leave.
[22569.11s -> 22577.52s]  It was the cast that did it?
[22577.52s -> 22578.08s]  Probably.
[22578.08s -> 22579.28s]  Well, I got the duo cast, right?
[22579.92s -> 22582.32s]  Beyond the frozen overlook.
[22582.32s -> 22584.77s]  Await the first glimpse of the sun to your left.
[22584.77s -> 22585.41s]  Made it to Greece.
[22585.41s -> 22588.02s]  Now onboard through the cold.
[22588.02s -> 22589.78s]  Sure hope this works, Nix.
[22589.78s -> 22605.06s]  Wouldn't it be kind of funny if instead of Greece,
[22605.86s -> 22608.18s]  it just sounds like, I don't know, Cleveland or something.
[22608.18s -> 22609.91s]  Be like, wait, what?
[22610.55s -> 22612.28s]  The surface.
[22612.84s -> 22614.12s]  Wind swept.
[22614.12s -> 22615.56s]  Wracked by freezing cold.
[22616.20s -> 22621.40s]  Nonetheless instills within the prince a sense of awe and the sublime.
[22621.40s -> 22624.07s]  For it is unlike anything that he has seen.
[22626.20s -> 22627.64s]  Circus goes to Cleveland.
[22631.17s -> 22636.61s]  Beautiful.
[22636.61s -> 22637.81s]  It is beautiful, isn't it?
[22638.37s -> 22653.49s]  Oh, that's nice.
[22656.23s -> 22656.87s]  Thing.
[22656.87s -> 22659.12s]  That's the sun.
[22659.12s -> 22660.48s]  Can I not be outside during this?
[22660.48s -> 22663.44s]  Is it a fire or something?
[22663.44s -> 22664.72s]  Something to do with my skin burn?
[22664.72s -> 22665.44s]  Am I like a vampire?
[22679.14s -> 22682.34s]  There's not a final final boss.
[22683.51s -> 22684.01s]  Is there?
[22684.80s -> 22685.76s]  I feel like there could be.
[22690.60s -> 22691.48s]  Wow.
[22691.48s -> 22696.31s]  I made it to Greece where they have only one food instead of three foods.
[22699.00s -> 22700.36s]  Oh, fuck this place.
[22700.36s -> 22701.48s]  All you have is tomatoes.
[22702.12s -> 22705.64s]  We had at least fish and bread downstairs.
[22709.17s -> 22712.29s]  And I think, I don't know about this.
[22712.29s -> 22715.65s]  Pray, who might you be wandering all the way out here?
[22715.65s -> 22718.74s]  You're trespassing on private property, you know.
[22718.74s -> 22719.78s]  Speak up.
[22719.78s -> 22723.11s]  What about the cabbage?
[22723.83s -> 22726.02s]  Oh, yeah, I'm not going to eat like grass.
[22726.66s -> 22729.22s]  What, would you eat like trees?
[22729.22s -> 22729.70s]  Grass?
[22729.70s -> 22730.26s]  No, thank you.
[22731.62s -> 22732.98s]  Meat and cheese only.
[22732.98s -> 22745.70s]  Persephone, is Zagreus and might be your son.
[22745.70s -> 22747.22s]  Get out or I shall make you.
[22747.22s -> 22749.46s]  I thought it said make out with you.
[22752.32s -> 22755.04s]  I didn't read the you after the second line there.
[22755.92s -> 22758.32s]  Get out of here or I shall make out with you.
[22759.94s -> 22763.08s]  So then you are, if you hate me.
[22763.08s -> 22765.16s]  But I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
[22765.16s -> 22767.08s]  You existed.
[22767.80s -> 22768.76s]  Why did you leave me?
[22769.72s -> 22772.76s]  What is Persephone the god of?
[22772.76s -> 22773.64s]  You died.
[22773.64s -> 22774.14s]  Verdure.
[22774.92s -> 22775.42s]  Verdure.
[22775.42s -> 22775.88s]  You died.
[22775.88s -> 22776.36s]  Verdure?
[22776.36s -> 22777.08s]  What is verdure?
[22777.08s -> 22777.72s]  His burning feet.
[22777.72s -> 22780.50s]  They sputtered out when you were born.
[22780.50s -> 22781.00s]  Beauty.
[22781.62s -> 22785.30s]  Are you standing here before me?
[22785.30s -> 22786.26s]  It's harvest, yeah.
[22786.26s -> 22786.98s]  What beauty?
[22786.98s -> 22787.62s]  How?
[22793.65s -> 22794.93s]  What do you mean permanently died?
[22794.93s -> 22796.13s]  But I'm alive.
[22796.13s -> 22797.64s]  Thoughts.
[22798.44s -> 22800.28s]  You never even knew I existed either.
[22803.70s -> 22807.00s]  Zagreus, he even kept your name.
[22807.72s -> 22810.28s]  How can this be?
[22810.28s -> 22818.50s]  You live, fate, my son.
[22818.50s -> 22819.30s]  Settle down, mom.
[22819.30s -> 22820.42s]  I'm not Frankenstein.
[22820.98s -> 22822.13s]  I'm a boy.
[22822.13s -> 22822.77s]  I'm a real boy.
[22831.16s -> 22832.04s]  Shut up, Jerma.
[22833.25s -> 22835.17s]  In short, I beat him finally,
[22835.17s -> 22838.13s]  though he did everything he could to prevent our meeting here like this.
[22838.93s -> 22841.17s]  But there's something he wanted me to tell you in the end.
[22841.97s -> 22844.61s]  He said to tell you Cerberus is doing very well.
[22845.49s -> 22849.44s]  Ah, he told you that, did he?
[22850.16s -> 22850.80s]  That's good.
[22851.36s -> 22852.00s]  That's good.
[22853.06s -> 22855.14s]  Though, tell me something, Zagreus.
[22855.14s -> 22857.30s]  How is it that you found me?
[22858.02s -> 22861.22s]  To have journeyed all this way, I scarce believe it.
[22862.66s -> 22863.30s]  Zagreus?
[22864.26s -> 22864.82s]  I don't know.
[22864.82s -> 22866.34s]  Just walked over here.
[22867.14s -> 22867.70s]  Oh, it's...
[22868.42s -> 22869.78s]  Guess I'm just a little tired.
[22869.78s -> 22870.18s]  That's all.
[22870.18s -> 22871.14s]  I have a live sickness.
[22871.14s -> 22873.14s]  ...accustomed to the weather, as I think you call it.
[22873.78s -> 22875.14s]  I definitely have a live sickness.
[22875.14s -> 22876.02s]  I'm not supposed to be alive.
[22878.48s -> 22880.00s]  No, that isn't it.
[22880.00s -> 22883.59s]  It's that you cannot stay here.
[22885.33s -> 22886.37s]  You can't stay here.
[22887.99s -> 22891.03s]  Really, you're kicking me out?
[22891.03s -> 22891.59s]  Why?
[22891.59s -> 22894.36s]  The fates are cruel, Zagreus.
[22895.25s -> 22896.45s]  You're bound to that place.
[22897.57s -> 22898.61s]  Same as your father.
[22899.83s -> 22902.55s]  So they would have us say goodbye for now.
[22904.26s -> 22906.18s]  My heart soars knowing you live.
[22907.06s -> 22910.23s]  But then it breaks that our time together was so brief.
[22911.88s -> 22915.06s]  No, I can come back.
[22915.06s -> 22915.78s]  I can come back.
[22916.42s -> 22917.62s]  Now that I found you, he...
[22918.58s -> 22919.86s]  Maybe he'll just let me come back.
[22919.86s -> 22922.82s]  So I have to fight my way out of Hades
[22924.39s -> 22926.87s]  to hang out with my mother for 15 minutes a day.
[22931.92s -> 22933.44s]  You tell him I demand it.
[22934.52s -> 22936.84s]  And I demand he also tell me how come he,
[22937.64s -> 22938.92s]  or for that matter Nyx,
[22939.72s -> 22941.40s]  never sent notice that you lived?
[22942.85s -> 22944.85s]  Olympus is all rife with schemers.
[22945.49s -> 22948.45s]  But I was so naive to think that they were different.
[22952.26s -> 22955.17s]  I'm telling him I feel awful.
[22955.97s -> 22958.00s]  I have to go.
[22959.27s -> 22961.43s]  Does it cut scene us or do I have to actually walk back?
[22961.43s -> 22962.87s]  The stick shall take you then.
[22963.43s -> 22965.01s]  Oh, Zagreus.
[22966.42s -> 22967.46s]  Farewell, my son.
[22968.02s -> 22970.34s]  Won't you come back to me?
[22971.14s -> 22974.90s]  When you are able, please come back.
[22974.90s -> 22977.38s]  I shall be waiting here.
[22987.32s -> 22990.36s]  Can't hold on.
[22990.36s -> 22995.38s]  This is a pretty sick prank by dad.
[22995.38s -> 23001.25s]  Mother, I have to get back there.
[23001.25s -> 23003.25s]  House of Hades, ha-ha, hooray.
[23003.25s -> 23004.69s]  You've finally returned.
[23004.69s -> 23005.97s]  Oh, hi, yeah.
[23009.72s -> 23010.36s]  That was fun.
[23010.36s -> 23011.72s]  You are late, boy.
[23011.72s -> 23015.17s]  Does he remember that I killed him?
[23016.39s -> 23017.83s]  No. Wait, what?
[23017.83s -> 23020.55s]  I vanquished you in single combat and finally found mother
[23020.55s -> 23021.75s]  and that's all you have to say to me.
[23024.53s -> 23025.75s]  Nonsense.
[23026.31s -> 23028.47s]  Don't you think I would recall such an event?
[23030.53s -> 23031.49s]  You can't be serious.
[23031.49s -> 23032.77s]  So I went back in time or something?
[23032.77s -> 23033.57s]  It never happened.
[23034.21s -> 23036.29s]  She wants answers same as I do.
[23036.29s -> 23037.57s]  She demands you let me pass.
[23038.37s -> 23039.41s]  Let me go to her again.
[23041.32s -> 23041.82s]  Silence.
[23042.68s -> 23044.36s]  This discussion is over.
[23045.32s -> 23048.28s]  I hardly think this is the time or place to indulge
[23048.28s -> 23049.80s]  your overwrought imagination.
[23049.80s -> 23052.13s]  Gaslighting, right?
[23052.13s -> 23054.29s]  I know where we can continue this discussion then.
[23054.93s -> 23056.37s]  Got to kill him a bunch more times.
[23058.64s -> 23063.06s]  Well, might as well just get the fountain upgrade.
[23063.94s -> 23065.49s]  Hey, I'm going to call it here.
[23065.49s -> 23066.77s]  I like the sound of this one here.
[23066.77s -> 23068.21s]  That's a good place to stop for the day.
[23068.93s -> 23070.80s]  But I'm going to do my upgrades first.
[23071.44s -> 23075.28s]  Are you the one whom I should thank for this most wondrous
[23075.28s -> 23076.32s]  music stand, my friend?
[23077.20s -> 23079.60s]  Why, it is positively splendid, isn't it?
[23081.62s -> 23082.34s]  Go to the quests?
[23082.34s -> 23086.18s]  Yeah, I'm going to go make sure I do all my tasks.
[23086.18s -> 23087.46s]  I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus.
[23088.50s -> 23089.62s]  Tell me something.
[23089.62s -> 23091.70s]  How could it play your music when you're not even here?
[23093.76s -> 23096.48s]  Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend?
[23097.28s -> 23100.48s]  Know only that whenever it produces music for your listening
[23100.48s -> 23104.32s]  enjoyment that the sound you hear is coming from my soul.
[23107.20s -> 23109.68s]  Amazing and a bit unsettling.
[23109.68s -> 23110.40s]  Bye, Nyx.
[23110.40s -> 23113.52s]  Your father felt to you as once his father felt to him.
[23114.40s -> 23116.48s]  Although you were substantially more merciful.
[23117.36s -> 23119.68s]  I know it is a bitter victory at best.
[23119.68s -> 23120.64s]  Bye, Daedalus.
[23120.64s -> 23124.24s]  Tell me what transpired subsequently that you have returned.
[23125.04s -> 23126.48s]  Did you locate your birth mother?
[23127.54s -> 23127.94s]  I did.
[23128.82s -> 23129.38s]  She was there.
[23130.02s -> 23131.62s]  She was where you said she'd be.
[23132.26s -> 23133.46s]  And more than I imagined.
[23133.46s -> 23135.81s]  But I had so little time with her.
[23136.77s -> 23138.37s]  I can't survive up there for very long.
[23138.93s -> 23141.57s]  Why didn't you tell me I'd just die no matter what?
[23142.90s -> 23143.94s]  Oh, my child.
[23144.90s -> 23148.52s]  I say this seldomly, but I did not know.
[23148.52s -> 23152.84s]  It is through for views to believe that the service would
[23152.84s -> 23154.20s]  have such an effect on you.
[23155.08s -> 23158.20s]  But it seems you share your father's fate after all.
[23158.20s -> 23160.42s]  Oh, he's playing cheers to you.
[23161.46s -> 23163.14s]  I've really got to take a bow on this one.
[23163.78s -> 23167.75s]  Every time he loses with cheers to you, he gets really sad
[23167.75s -> 23170.15s]  because that's supposed to give him super powers.
[23171.88s -> 23172.36s]  Right.
[23172.36s -> 23178.63s]  My father's fate, but he was smugly waiting for me up there
[23178.63s -> 23180.71s]  and seemed quite healthy all in all.
[23180.71s -> 23184.37s]  Though maybe the farther we get from this realm, the worse we get.
[23185.41s -> 23186.37s]  Because he.
[23186.37s -> 23191.73s]  So I now presume you are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine.
[23192.61s -> 23193.41s]  Tell me something.
[23194.13s -> 23197.89s]  If you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time,
[23198.77s -> 23200.61s]  would you still make the journey to her there?
[23203.91s -> 23204.41s]  Yes.
[23204.95s -> 23206.07s]  Yes, I would.
[23206.07s -> 23207.59s]  I had so many questions left for her.
[23209.30s -> 23211.38s]  Then go and ask them, child.
[23212.34s -> 23214.66s]  Settle your resolve and find her there again.
[23215.60s -> 23219.20s]  And use well what brief time you have with one another whilst you can.
[23220.08s -> 23221.04s]  As mortals do.
[23221.76s -> 23223.60s]  What does Tumblr game even mean?
[23225.68s -> 23226.96s]  I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[23227.92s -> 23231.43s]  I haven't given Nick's a gift.
[23234.93s -> 23237.57s]  Zagreus, please tell me that the rumors are untrue.
[23238.21s -> 23239.65s]  You really vanquished him.
[23239.65s -> 23240.21s]  Devonka Trump.
[23240.21s -> 23242.05s]  Have you completely lost your mind?
[23242.05s -> 23243.97s]  You're going to destroy this blasted house.
[23245.70s -> 23246.82s]  Holy shit, that took a long.
[23246.82s -> 23247.78s]  That was holy shit.
[23247.78s -> 23248.42s]  That took forever.
[23248.42s -> 23249.94s]  I was trying to figure out who it sounded like.
[23250.66s -> 23253.86s]  Make father had it coming for some time.
[23253.86s -> 23256.34s]  What's your concern besides the house is safe.
[23257.94s -> 23260.10s]  He's not going to take this lying down.
[23260.10s -> 23262.82s]  He'll find some way to take it out on you on all of us.
[23263.54s -> 23264.58s]  You watch yourself.
[23264.58s -> 23265.46s]  All of us will pay.
[23266.74s -> 23270.42s]  I will not let that happen.
[23270.42s -> 23277.35s]  I didn't get a new fish.
[23279.14s -> 23280.02s]  Take that back.
[23280.74s -> 23281.99s]  It's a great voice.
[23281.99s -> 23283.75s]  It's a great voice acting.
[23283.75s -> 23288.48s]  It's time for me to give my final review of the game.
[23289.20s -> 23290.24s]  Voice acting?
[23290.24s -> 23291.20s]  Incredible.
[23291.20s -> 23293.25s]  A 98 out of 100.
[23293.25s -> 23294.85s]  Very, like, just across the board.
[23294.85s -> 23295.89s]  Just fantastic.
[23295.89s -> 23297.17s]  All the characters are perfectly cast.
[23297.17s -> 23300.40s]  It's fucking, it's phenomenal.
[23300.40s -> 23302.08s]  Two, the combat.
[23302.08s -> 23303.01s]  It's great.
[23303.01s -> 23304.21s]  It trickles you new weapons.
[23304.21s -> 23304.93s]  You can play with them.
[23304.93s -> 23306.05s]  You find the ones you like.
[23306.05s -> 23308.13s]  Then there's still ones that I don't even have.
[23308.13s -> 23308.61s]  Very good.
[23308.61s -> 23309.09s]  Very awesome.
[23309.73s -> 23313.46s]  The upgrade system is, whoa.
[23314.40s -> 23315.04s]  All the combos.
[23315.04s -> 23315.84s]  The duos.
[23315.84s -> 23316.80s]  The rarity.
[23316.80s -> 23318.40s]  It gives you the rarity itch.
[23318.40s -> 23320.24s]  Where, oh, RNG, I got a fucking epic.
[23320.24s -> 23320.96s]  All right, cool.
[23320.96s -> 23321.44s]  Perfect.
[23321.44s -> 23321.84s]  Great.
[23321.84s -> 23322.72s]  That's a 10.
[23322.72s -> 23328.72s]  The enemies that can shoot you across the map.
[23328.72s -> 23330.74s]  That's a 4.
[23330.74s -> 23332.16s]  I don't like that.
[23332.16s -> 23337.92s]  But that has, like, 1% weighted on the index here.
[23339.78s -> 23346.52s]  Sometimes it can get a little confusing.
[23346.52s -> 23347.72s]  There's a lot of stuff going on on the screen.
[23347.72s -> 23348.84s]  You can get lost.
[23348.84s -> 23354.12s]  I like the areas.
[23354.12s -> 23355.08s]  I like the art style.
[23356.08s -> 23356.64s]  Looks cool.
[23356.64s -> 23358.80s]  I hope they have Greek and Roman mythology.
[23358.80s -> 23359.68s]  It's cool.
[23359.68s -> 23369.16s]  The 94.
[23369.16s -> 23380.04s]  And it's not over.
[23380.04s -> 23380.44s]  Oh, I know.
[23381.00s -> 23383.06s]  I know that.
[23383.06s -> 23385.97s]  Weapon room or no balls.
[23385.97s -> 23386.93s]  I'm going to walk over there.
[23386.93s -> 23387.41s]  Just hold on.
[23387.41s -> 23397.12s]  There's only a matter of time, I suppose.
[23397.12s -> 23397.60s]  Wow.
[23397.60s -> 23397.92s]  That's...
[23399.04s -> 23400.24s]  I broke free after all.
[23400.24s -> 23401.52s]  Okay, that's how you get that.
[23403.06s -> 23403.70s]  Thousand.
[23403.70s -> 23404.58s]  Holy shit.
[23404.58s -> 23405.46s]  Okay, hold on.
[23406.10s -> 23408.31s]  Nothing else, right?
[23411.32s -> 23412.52s]  14 out of 30.
[23414.53s -> 23415.33s]  Renovations.
[23415.97s -> 23416.37s]  Okay.
[23417.17s -> 23418.39s]  What am I still missing here?
[23422.47s -> 23424.93s]  I need more keys.
[23424.93s -> 23428.71s]  Where's Thanatos?
[23429.27s -> 23432.39s]  He's asleep.
[23432.39s -> 23434.87s]  I don't know.
[23434.87s -> 23438.68s]  The exit.
[23439.00s -> 23440.12s]  Once in a while, pal,
[23440.12s -> 23442.04s]  you're going to see a real fancy bozo
[23442.04s -> 23443.40s]  try to ruin your good time.
[23443.40s -> 23445.48s]  You'll know him because he's glowing like a light.
[23445.48s -> 23447.56s]  But that's his special armor, see?
[23447.56s -> 23449.00s]  You got to punch right through it.
[23449.00s -> 23450.60s]  He's going to shrug you off until you do.
[23451.32s -> 23453.12s]  For a good time,
[23453.12s -> 23455.60s]  beware the fancy glowing bozos on my quest.
[23456.88s -> 23460.71s]  Let's try it.
[23461.35s -> 23461.99s]  Exagriff.
[23461.99s -> 23462.47s]  The rail abatement.
[23462.47s -> 23463.27s]  Exagriff.
[23463.27s -> 23464.79s]  Annihilate all who oppose me.
[23468.47s -> 23472.68s]  Wow.
[23473.24s -> 23474.53s]  Wait, it has bullets?
[23475.33s -> 23477.76s]  Hold them and release to bombard.
[23487.36s -> 23488.08s]  That's awesome.
[23490.07s -> 23490.95s]  That reloads.
[23494.60s -> 23496.12s]  Push in R to reload?
[23496.84s -> 23502.87s]  Can I change that keybinding if I ever wanted to do that?
[23502.87s -> 23503.83s]  I don't like that keybind.
[23504.63s -> 23506.24s]  It's kind of, it's awkward.
[23507.12s -> 23515.27s]  It's kind of like the bow and the gloves combined together.
[23515.27s -> 23527.01s]  Look at the window.
[23527.01s -> 23529.12s]  What the hell does this say?
[23529.12s -> 23529.60s]  Prepare.
[23531.89s -> 23534.61s]  Congratulations, your deeds have compelled Lord Hades
[23534.61s -> 23535.97s]  to serve you a pact of punishment.
[23535.97s -> 23537.01s]  Here's how it works.
[23537.01s -> 23539.24s]  The pact can make escaping more difficult
[23539.24s -> 23541.32s]  via various nasty conditions.
[23541.32s -> 23544.92s]  Each condition you accept adds some heat to your heat gauge.
[23544.92s -> 23546.28s]  While your heat gauge is full,
[23546.28s -> 23548.28s]  you can earn valuable bounties.
[23548.28s -> 23550.69s]  You earn one bounty
[23550.69s -> 23553.25s]  the first time you vanquish the boss of each underworld region
[23553.25s -> 23554.85s]  while your heat gauge is full.
[23554.85s -> 23556.32s]  Once you successfully escape,
[23556.32s -> 23558.24s]  you can earn more bounties if you turn up the heat.
[23558.80s -> 23560.80s]  And you can earn bounties for each weapon.
[23560.80s -> 23563.44s]  How much heat you need is per weapon as well.
[23566.15s -> 23568.82s]  Oops, can I take that off?
[23569.46s -> 23571.88s]  Choose any condition if you dare.
[23571.88s -> 23572.92s]  Get out using the,
[23572.92s -> 23575.24s]  get out using the adamant rail.
[23576.63s -> 23578.71s]  All prices are 40% more.
[23578.71s -> 23581.35s]  Don't need to turn the heat gauge so high to earn those bounties.
[23581.35s -> 23582.31s]  Heat gauge exceeded.
[23583.19s -> 23588.52s]  This is ridiculous.
[23589.16s -> 23602.00s]  You have fewer choices when offered boons, bounties.
[23603.62s -> 23605.30s]  I get one heat and I use the rail.
[23605.30s -> 23606.66s]  I get bounties for doing this.
[23607.22s -> 23608.42s]  Achilles or I'm going to die.
[23608.42s -> 23609.38s]  Um, hold on.
[23609.38s -> 23610.26s]  I got one to see.
[23610.26s -> 23610.98s]  Hold on a minute.
[23611.54s -> 23613.20s]  Just quiet.
[23614.20s -> 23614.92s]  Quiet.
[23614.92s -> 23616.44s]  Another day in Tartarus.
[23616.44s -> 23617.40s]  I demand silence.
[23618.12s -> 23621.57s]  I'm a punching.
[23621.57s -> 23622.05s]  Get off me.
[23622.05s -> 23622.55s]  Hey, room.
[23627.73s -> 23628.23s]  Let's see.
[23628.85s -> 23640.44s]  And I have so much.
[23640.44s -> 23641.56s]  I don't, I don't want to spend anything.
[23642.20s -> 23643.32s]  I'm not spending anything right now.
[23644.04s -> 23648.36s]  Come here.
[23648.82s -> 23649.72s]  Do, sir.
[23649.72s -> 23652.84s]  Turns out that I may be stopping back from time to time like this.
[23652.84s -> 23654.60s]  But please don't bother picking up my room.
[23657.00s -> 23660.72s]  Sure, but I'll just keep an eye on things in there for the time.
[23660.72s -> 23662.08s]  In case you change your mind.
[23662.08s -> 23663.60s]  Um, so.
[23663.60s -> 23666.39s]  What's this deal?
[23666.39s -> 23667.83s]  Um, goodbye.
[23667.83s -> 23669.03s]  I'm going to go talk to Achilles.
[23669.03s -> 23672.15s]  Oh, that guy is going to like smash his laptop into the ground.
[23672.15s -> 23672.79s]  Here.
[23672.79s -> 23674.15s]  I found her, sir.
[23674.23s -> 23679.48s]  My mother, she's alive and well, and I just couldn't stay up there for very long.
[23679.48s -> 23680.52s]  I have to get back to her.
[23682.04s -> 23683.24s]  You really made it all the way.
[23683.24s -> 23686.34s]  You must have gotten past your father.
[23686.34s -> 23687.62s]  That's amazing, lad.
[23687.62s -> 23689.72s]  But wait, what was she like?
[23689.72s -> 23690.68s]  What happened to you there?
[23692.37s -> 23694.29s]  She was, she was great.
[23695.01s -> 23697.81s]  Nothing like father, more like you a little bit, I guess.
[23698.61s -> 23701.81s]  Though being on the surface, it just seemed to suck the life right out of me.
[23702.61s -> 23705.01s]  Even without the wretches of the underworld trying to do me in.
[23707.33s -> 23708.85s]  But then you had a little time at least.
[23709.65s -> 23711.97s]  Sounds like you have unfinished business with her there.
[23711.97s -> 23713.01s]  You got to her this once.
[23713.65s -> 23715.41s]  Surely you're able to again, isn't that right?
[23718.76s -> 23719.16s]  It is.
[23719.80s -> 23720.84s]  I have to speak with her.
[23722.28s -> 23723.40s]  Hey, why did you want, what was,
[23725.32s -> 23726.84s]  why did you want me to do that so bad?
[23729.81s -> 23733.09s]  That was just a regular, just sort of lore conversation.
[23736.47s -> 23737.43s]  Because we like him.
[23738.15s -> 23738.65s]  Oh.
[23739.70s -> 23740.90s]  All right, I'm going to call it here.
[23742.74s -> 23746.23s]  Uh, I might still play this next week.
[23746.23s -> 23747.59s]  We're going to change tomorrow.
[23747.59s -> 23748.31s]  We're going to play something else.
[23748.31s -> 23749.43s]  Chat's choices tomorrow.
[23749.43s -> 23756.68s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[23756.68s -> 23759.08s]  I will give you a list of games to vote on.
[23759.08s -> 23761.76s]  There'll be a poll tomorrow pre-stream.
[23761.76s -> 23765.03s]  Stream will be tomorrow around the same time it started today.
[23765.03s -> 23767.03s]  Between somewhere around 1.30 or 2.
[23767.03s -> 23768.61s]  I'll just set it to 2.
[23771.16s -> 23772.52s]  And I'll see you later.
[23772.52s -> 23773.99s]  Let's do the credits.
[23774.63s -> 23779.08s]  I missed a few subs here.
[23779.08s -> 23779.96s]  We had Bo.
[23779.96s -> 23781.88s]  Thank you Bo for the five community subs.
[23781.88s -> 23783.88s]  And Litigation, thanks for five community subs.
[23786.28s -> 23788.63s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[23789.19s -> 23791.75s]  Have a great rest of your night.
[23791.75s -> 23794.82s]  Let's get the, actually I'm going to pee while the credits roll.
[23795.06s -> 23796.10s]  Have I peed all day?
[23796.66s -> 23797.24s]  I don't know.
[23797.24s -> 23798.04s]  I'll be back.
[23798.04s -> 23799.27s]  I'll be right back.
[23799.27s -> 23900.10s]  Okay, I have subs to give.
[23900.10s -> 23901.38s]  So let's do them now.
[23901.38s -> 23902.42s]  What was it at the total?
[23902.42s -> 23903.14s]  25?
[23903.14s -> 23907.28s]  25 subs I believe.
[23907.28s -> 23910.48s]  What it was after the contract has now expired.
[23910.48s -> 23914.08s]  Here come 25 community subs.
[23914.08s -> 23916.80s]  Do it right now.
[23916.80s -> 23924.58s]  25.
[23924.58s -> 23928.76s]  Thanks again everybody for watching.
[23928.76s -> 23930.72s]  Oh, don't leave yet.
[23930.72s -> 23931.84s]  Don't leave yet.
[23931.84s -> 23935.84s]  Here they come.
[23936.80s -> 23938.24s]  People didn't think I was going to do this.
[23938.24s -> 23941.73s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[23941.73s -> 23943.57s]  Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[23943.57s -> 23945.25s]  Take care of yourselves.
[23945.25s -> 23946.88s]  I'm going to get up.
[23946.88s -> 23948.10s]  See you tomorrow.
[23948.10s -> 23949.09s]  Take care guys.
