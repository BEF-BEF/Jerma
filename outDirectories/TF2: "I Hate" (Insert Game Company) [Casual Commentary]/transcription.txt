[0.31s -> 18.13s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, not exactly sure what I'm going to be playing as.
[18.13s -> 24.13s]  I'm going to be playing as one of the nine classes, I assume. Maybe even the tenth class, the Indian Chiefmaster.
[24.13s -> 30.30s]  I have no idea. So this video is not going to talk about Team Fortress 2. It's going to be a discussion video.
[30.30s -> 36.30s]  It's going to be something that was brought up last night when I was hanging out in Star's stream.
[36.30s -> 40.30s]  If you were there, then you probably know what this commentary is going to be about.
[40.30s -> 43.30s]  But if you weren't there, let me briefly bring this up.
[43.30s -> 48.04s]  We were playing a game in Alpha, and it's called Cannon Brawl. It's pretty fun.
[48.04s -> 55.04s]  It's a 1v1 type of Worms RTS hybrid base building tower shooting game, and it's great. I suggest you pick it up.
[55.04s -> 61.28s]  It's like less than ten bucks. If you got the money, you and your friend can have at least a few hours of fun.
[61.28s -> 66.71s]  Regardless of any of that, a couple of developers were actually in the stream chat.
[66.71s -> 69.71s]  The guys that made the game were hanging out in Star's stream.
[69.71s -> 72.71s]  We got to talking with them. They were legitimate. They weren't making it up.
[72.71s -> 76.71s]  It wasn't like, oh yeah, I'm the developer. And it just wasn't them. It was actually them.
[76.71s -> 79.71s]  Which was cool in itself. I love talking to developers.
[79.71s -> 85.71s]  I love seeing where they're coming from, seeing their angles, finding out stuff about them, the backstory, etc.
[85.71s -> 91.95s]  And that kind of conversation got into people talking about in the comment section how much they hate certain developers
[91.95s -> 98.95s]  because they don't do certain things, they have bad customer support, and screw them. Like, fuck EA.
[98.95s -> 104.95s]  And that's the topic of this discussion. That's the topic of this video. That's where I want to go with this.
[104.95s -> 114.61s]  Because when you say something like, in quotes, fuck EA, end quotes, what you're effectively saying is this.
[114.61s -> 118.61s]  At least, for the most part, this is what people mean when they utter this phrase.
[118.61s -> 122.61s]  What they're really talking about is the consumer-company relationship.
[122.61s -> 125.78s]  And the consumer-company relationship can mean a million different things.
[125.78s -> 128.78s]  It can mean the amount of money you have to spend on something.
[128.78s -> 134.78s]  It can mean who's in charge that's making broad spectrum company decisions.
[134.78s -> 141.22s]  It could mean how the company reacts to negative criticism or positive criticism.
[141.22s -> 143.22s]  It can mean a bunch of different things.
[143.22s -> 149.58s]  But a lot of people really, really get upset with, and I'm in this category myself, I'm included in this,
[149.58s -> 154.58s]  I get really mad at a company when they blatantly just mishandle the stuff I just said.
[154.58s -> 159.89s]  For instance, when a company charges way too much money for something, it annoys me.
[159.89s -> 163.89s]  When a company doesn't follow through on promises it makes, it annoys me.
[163.89s -> 169.13s]  When a company has a CEO that's like a complete dickwad, that annoys me.
[169.13s -> 175.30s]  But something that we all have to keep in mind is it's not just one guy that makes a video game.
[175.30s -> 180.30s]  It's not just one dude that is making all these decisions for this company.
[180.30s -> 185.30s]  There are thousands and thousands of people that are working for EA.
[185.30s -> 191.61s]  There are artists, there are programmers, there are coders, there are marketing people, there are advertising people,
[191.61s -> 193.61s]  there are people on the board.
[193.61s -> 198.22s]  If it's just one person you don't like, then do you really hate the company?
[198.22s -> 201.22s]  Or do you hate the person that's in charge?
[201.22s -> 205.22s]  Or do you hate this one particular person on the development team?
[205.22s -> 208.22s]  I'm going to give you a real situation of this.
[208.22s -> 210.22s]  For instance, Diablo III.
[210.22s -> 214.65s]  Diablo III was one of my most anticipated games ever.
[214.65s -> 218.65s]  Like, I was waiting so much for that game, I couldn't wait for it to come out.
[218.65s -> 223.65s]  The second it came out, I bought it like midnight release, let's go, I'm going to spend like 30 hours playing this game straight.
[223.65s -> 227.45s]  And I had a little bit of fun in D3.
[227.45s -> 229.45s]  I enjoyed myself.
[229.45s -> 239.45s]  But after a while, it started to really annoy me that the developers took this game such in a far direction away from one of my favorite games of all time, which is Diablo II.
[239.45s -> 247.45s]  I made a review of Diablo III, and I even said, if you're a die-hard Diablo II fan, this game's going to let you down in a lot of places.
[247.45s -> 254.01s]  And it really got me thinking, do I hate Blizzard for making Diablo III the way they did?
[254.01s -> 260.01s]  I guess maybe there'd be a couple of rage moments when I was sitting in a game going, man, like, I hate Blizzard.
[260.01s -> 262.01s]  What the hell, man? Like, what did you do to this game?
[262.01s -> 264.01s]  Like, how could you, Blizzard?
[264.01s -> 267.01s]  In quotes, just like the same EA, how could you?
[267.01s -> 268.01s]  Fuck you, EA.
[268.01s -> 273.44s]  But then you break it down even more and it's like, but who, who was even really responsible for this?
[273.44s -> 275.44s]  It was not Blizzard as a whole.
[275.44s -> 280.44s]  It was only like a few guys in Blizzard that probably made these decisions.
[280.44s -> 282.44s]  The StarCraft guys didn't do it.
[282.44s -> 285.44s]  The friggin' Warcraft team had nothing to do with it.
[285.44s -> 291.44s]  So why would I hate Blizzard as a company when it only was a couple of people that really had the say?
[291.44s -> 298.05s]  And something else to keep in mind is most of the people that work for these companies, guys, are just going to work.
[298.05s -> 302.05s]  They're just going to work and they're doing their thing and they're going home and they're going home to their family.
[302.05s -> 307.05s]  They're working their ass off as a programmer or an artist or a coder or a concept designer.
[307.05s -> 310.05s]  And then they leave and they go home to their families.
[310.05s -> 315.05s]  And they don't read forum posts about how much people hate the company that they work for.
[315.05s -> 319.05s]  Hell, they might not even like the company they work for, but they're doing it anyways.
[319.05s -> 331.98s]  And my whole point here is when you make a generalization about really anything, you include all the people that you really didn't mean to include when you made the generalization.
[331.98s -> 333.98s]  So just keep that in mind.
[333.98s -> 335.98s]  It's something that we were talking about in the stream.
[335.98s -> 336.98s]  And I was like, you know what?
[336.98s -> 337.98s]  I want to make a commentary about this.
[337.98s -> 340.98s]  I want to see what everybody has to say.
[340.98s -> 343.98s]  So please in the comments section below, leave what you think about this.
[343.98s -> 353.98s]  Leave your opinions on this and maybe some generalizations that you've made over the last couple of years, because I know I've done plenty of them when it comes to game companies for sure.
[353.98s -> 355.41s]  But yeah, that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[355.41s -> 357.41s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[357.41s -> 358.41s]  I really do appreciate it.
[358.41s -> 359.41s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[359.41s -> 362.41s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
