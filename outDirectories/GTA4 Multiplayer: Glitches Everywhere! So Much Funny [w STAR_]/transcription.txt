[0.31s -> 23.50s]  Hold on, hold on a second. Do you see him sliding? No. He is sliding like no animation on my screen.
[23.50s -> 28.99s]  Is he dead? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I was gonna like beat him up, but... He's dead.
[28.99s -> 36.66s]  Yo, Jarvan, look at this guy. He's dead. He's bleeding. There's a puddle of... Hold on, what happened?
[36.66s -> 44.66s]  He tripped on this little triangle over here. He ran so fast. He hit this and he died.
[44.66s -> 48.66s]  Look how far... Look at his neck from over here. It kind of looks like it's broken, doesn't it?
[48.66s -> 54.66s]  Dude, he must have smashed his face so hard to instantly die.
[61.79s -> 69.22s]  We're still riding the wheelie. Wow, you can hold this for a long time. Whoa! Oh my god.
[69.22s -> 79.88s]  That was cool. Oh, we just... Oh, fine, I got this. You wanna see my skills? Oh, here's a sick jump.
[96.44s -> 104.68s]  Why is that jump there? That whole chain of events just didn't make any sense.
[104.68s -> 114.00s]  And then I hit my face on a wall. That was awesome. What is this giant boat? Oh, I thought that was a boat.
[114.00s -> 118.50s]  Here, let me do a wheelie onto this lady. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You gotta...
[120.50s -> 139.83s]  What is happening? How did we get down here? No! You see that. I do. I'm not gonna freak out.
[139.83s -> 144.83s]  Can you snipe it? Can you snipe the guy out of it? No, I don't know. Don't shoot him. You don't want to risk it?
[144.83s -> 148.83s]  No, because he'll step on the gas like sometimes they do. What is he doing? He already knows we're after him.
[148.83s -> 154.83s]  He's bullying this guy off the road from... Yeah, if I shoot this guy right now, he's going to step on the gas.
[154.83s -> 162.91s]  Wouldn't you, if you're in this car? Well, shoot him in the head. Go. Nice. I'm driving this.
[162.91s -> 177.06s]  Not nice, because now... Where is he? Did he get you? He got you, Jerma. He was completely stopped.
[179.06s -> 195.44s]  The ghost of the guy in the GT. His otherworldly soul needed revenge on me. I can't believe that happened. Why did that happen?
[195.44s -> 203.77s]  We got out. Is he dead? Yeah, I got him out of the car somehow. I think this car is cursed now, though.
[203.77s -> 208.46s]  No, it's getting away. Get in the car, get in the car, get in the car, get in the car. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[208.46s -> 212.46s]  I'm trying. That lady is like... Oh my god, do you see this lady?
[214.46s -> 221.13s]  Hold on, did I... I got in the car? How did I get in the car?
[221.13s -> 226.50s]  No question. Just go, go, go, go. Keep going straight. Fast, fast.
[227.50s -> 241.72s]  I don't understand what just happened. Let's see if you can do it. My whole life is riding on this moment.
[241.72s -> 248.96s]  Your entire life is riding on if you can make this GTA jump. I will die if I don't do it.
[248.96s -> 259.40s]  I'm dead. How does that happen?
[259.40s -> 267.22s]  We hit the first step. Hold on, let's think about this in reality right now.
[267.22s -> 276.14s]  That's probably what would happen if you tried to do that in the big... What the hell is going on?
[276.14s -> 281.02s]  I thought you were going to drive right into that guy. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[281.02s -> 284.02s]  Not going in the tunnel. Go to the left of the tunnel. We're going to turn right again.
[284.02s -> 290.85s]  I don't think that's going to... We're fine, we're fine. We're fine, we're fine.
[290.85s -> 303.29s]  Go fast, fast. Hit this guy. 10 points. Don't get hit by these cars. Oh my god. You did, didn't you?
[303.29s -> 308.91s]  I hit my face on the lamppost. I've never seen that before.
[308.91s -> 310.91s]  Okay, get on your bike. Meet me.
[310.91s -> 313.91s]  Hold on. I'm recovering from this laugh.
[320.38s -> 332.92s]  Sick burnout, bro. Did you see the guy I hit behind you? Oh my god.
[333.92s -> 343.00s]  This is so... I can't... Oh, good thing, good.
[343.00s -> 346.00s]  We wanted to do as much car damage to this as humanly possible.
[346.00s -> 353.57s]  Yes, before it blows up. You know what, Jerma? I say we get it to the point where it's going to blow up.
[353.57s -> 354.57s]  It's on fire. Yep. Yep.
[354.57s -> 356.57s]  All right, what do you want to do with it? Just keep driving.
[356.57s -> 362.96s]  Just pretend like, you know, you want to go to 7-Eleven and get some late night snacks.
[362.96s -> 366.96s]  Yeah, they have drinks at 7-Eleven, right? Of course they do.
[366.96s -> 372.96s]  Yeah, that's usually all I get at 7-Eleven. I don't know if, like, you want, um, like, Funyuns or something weird.
[372.96s -> 375.96s]  I was pretty close, but I, like, bumped something.
[375.96s -> 378.96s]  We're going over the bridge. I'm sick of this place.
[378.96s -> 382.96s]  Oh, no, this tire... This tire's not having it.
[384.65s -> 388.66s]  Yeah, you just ran... I did that. I did that.
[388.66s -> 392.66s]  Yep. You gonna kill me, Jerma? You gonna keep killing me? Or can we actually, like, have some fun with this?
[392.66s -> 398.66s]  I'm sitting in the front seat. How would I have been able to do that, GTA?
[398.66s -> 403.02s]  He killed it. He ran himself over. I didn't do anything.
