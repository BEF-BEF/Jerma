[1.46s -> 27.99s]  I feel alive. Oh hey look, it's you again. How you doing? How's everybody? Has my brain healed?
[28.79s -> 36.81s]  Um yes, but no. Because I had a annoying headache yesterday and you get headaches.
[38.14s -> 43.16s]  Uh it sort of, it sort of like turns you, I remember I told you it turns you off for a little
[43.16s -> 50.20s]  while. So I feel all right. I feel fine and I rested up a little bit. But there's like a,
[50.20s -> 59.18s]  there's a notch up here that's like flicked off. It's hard to explain, but I feel I'm good to go.
[59.74s -> 65.54s]  If you got like seven notches in your brain that have to be turned on at all times,
[67.54s -> 73.08s]  one of them is like reading, one of them is like a arithmetic, one of them is like
[73.08s -> 79.16s]  arguments and debates, and the other one is playing a video game. That one's probably
[79.16s -> 92.23s]  turned off. I can read just fine. I'll prove it to you. Resident Evil 2. No, I just, I made
[92.23s -> 95.35s]  that up. I just, I got that from memory. I need, I need like a piece of material I haven't
[95.35s -> 110.31s]  seen yet. Uh what, at the bottom there. Capcom coal limited 1998. I'm fine. Go.
[111.27s -> 120.10s]  Oh shit, I have to tweet that. Let me get a quick tweet. You know, I don't think I even
[120.10s -> 130.94s]  tweeted last night, did I? No, I didn't. What kind of fucking streamer am I?
[135.11s -> 140.71s]  And I know that I have, uh, you can automatically have Twitter when you go live,
[140.71s -> 145.35s]  just send an automatic tweet. But I don't, I don't want to do that. I think you can do
[145.35s -> 152.50s]  that. You can set that up. But when you do that, doesn't it just, German 95 is now playing
[152.50s -> 163.03s]  Resident Evil 2 on the site twitch.tv. No, I'd rather write, like on my own, like RE2
[165.42s -> 174.63s]  coming at you, right? And then give the website link. But hope you guys are having
[174.63s -> 183.72s]  a good day today. We're going to pick up exactly where we left off. No, I didn't do
[183.72s -> 187.00s]  anything else after the stream. I kind of turned it off and just went right downstairs
[187.00s -> 193.37s]  and hung out. RE2 coming, yeah you can't, I can't do that with an automated system.
[194.01s -> 202.01s]  And if I can, then, oh fuck, I didn't know I could. Uh, let's adjust some audio here. And why
[202.01s -> 207.45s]  don't, hey! Why don't I bring the villain hair back, you know what I mean? That's too bright,
[207.45s -> 225.35s]  this is too bright. I should, I need to be like in a different spot. Okay, there we go.
[226.15s -> 237.82s]  Still light outside, but it won't be for long. Put on the sunglasses. No, I'm all right,
[237.82s -> 243.18s]  I'm all right. If I need to, I got, I have like an old pair of shitty gunner optics that I
[243.18s -> 247.74s]  threw in the trash. And then I went, ah, I probably shouldn't have thrown those in the trash,
[247.74s -> 250.94s]  because those were expensive. Those are expensive pieces of yellow glass.
[251.50s -> 254.94s]  So I took them out of the trash and I put it back on the table and I wiped them clean
[254.94s -> 267.48s]  with a little bit of, with a little bit of, uh, Lysol. I got a beard. No, it's called lazy
[267.48s -> 277.38s]  and annoyed, so I haven't shaved. Uh, he's using hair tonic. Hair tonic. Anywho, this
[277.46s -> 282.95s]  should be good. I'm going to drop the volume just a bit though, because I don't, I feel like it's
[282.95s -> 292.42s]  overpowering my little baby voice that's coming out here. Um, can I? Oh, these are unlock? I
[292.42s -> 299.86s]  thought this was chapter select. All right, eat this. That'll hold them. Uh, a new model
[299.86s -> 305.83s]  for the Matilda. Okay, bonuses. What's this? I don't want to see them all, but actually,
[313.67s -> 330.07s]  yeah, these things are fucking scary. It's a pretty good game. Yep, let's go.
[331.62s -> 338.90s]  Exactly where we were. I'm going to move this over here because Jeremy's face should not be
[338.90s -> 349.90s]  there, right? Jeremy's face needs to be somewhere else. All right, we're good. We're good. Let's
[349.90s -> 355.83s]  fucking go. Let me just check my fucking twitch ability, because remember I told you, like,
[356.47s -> 364.60s]  reading comprehension off, light detection on, smell off, FPS twitch shooting detection.
[365.56s -> 375.51s]  Uh oh, might have a problem. Might have a problem. Uh, so where are we? Let's see. I'm excited
[376.07s -> 383.02s]  for Resident Evil 2. So what's the, remind me the last thing we did, because I don't remember,
[383.02s -> 388.87s]  because memory, memory, memory has been turned off. That's a blue herb. I got a save point.
[390.63s -> 401.22s]  Engage the bionic boomers, please, sir. FPS shooting detection functioning at 75%.
[401.78s -> 408.10s]  Yeah, I have to go into the reserves for this one. I'm gonna bring the red jewel because
[408.98s -> 414.49s]  I want to, and I think it'll do me some good. Store that. Do I have any heals at all?
[416.39s -> 425.93s]  I have the one big one. I got one big heal, and I'm afraid to use it because it's the only
[425.93s -> 434.66s]  one I have. I have so many little toys now. The crank, I got the diamond key,
[435.46s -> 441.46s]  I got the car key, I have the box. Let me go out back to the garage.
[443.67s -> 455.70s]  Because there were cars out here. Wasn't there? Like, should I go look at the cars? Let's take a
[455.70s -> 474.74s]  look. Uh, car number is 7439. So, oh shit, did I just unlock the door? Uh oh. Oh wait, no, no,
[474.74s -> 482.49s]  hold on. What, it's, what's going on on the bottom there? Why are there little prongs that
[482.49s -> 502.15s]  are going, that are sticking in and sticking out? Do all the prongs need to be up? Prong one
[502.15s -> 508.62s]  and two. Look at prong two comes up. Probably some fucking puzzle. All right, uh, box electronic
[508.62s -> 522.47s]  parts. This is, I need two of these or not. Uh, a small electronic part. It sure is right there,
[522.47s -> 532.71s]  isn't it? Do I have to examine this cube too? So it's four prongs, a custom part for a power
[532.71s -> 541.56s]  panel. Yeah, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta like start to write down shit. You know what I mean?
[541.80s -> 553.90s]  I need a notebook that I can just write information down and save always. Okay,
[554.95s -> 558.47s]  let's just take a look and see what's in these things. We've got some gunpowder,
[561.53s -> 574.47s]  uh, a lot of bullets and how many of those am I going to destroy before it becomes, uh,
[574.47s -> 584.65s]  worthwhile? The magazine ammo. That's magnum ammo, isn't it? Electrical part. All right, let's
[585.37s -> 601.43s]  combine some shit, put some stuff in the storage. Shotgun shells. Uh, do I make more
[601.43s -> 612.33s]  shotgun shells or fucking boarded windows? I have too many items that I don't know what to do with.
[613.90s -> 620.63s]  Um, how about we have to have to put some of these away. We just do. I'll have to come back
[620.63s -> 628.52s]  and get them. How about let's make some more shotgun shells because you can never have too
[628.52s -> 638.54s]  many of these. Let's put the co, put the cocky. No, keep the cocky. Uh, store the
[639.10s -> 648.30s]  magnum bullets. The wooden boards. I'm still just gonna have the red jewel. Maybe just
[648.30s -> 659.08s]  get rid of it for now. I got the fancy looking key. Oh, combine the key now. All
[659.08s -> 664.84s]  right, let's go, let's take a, let's go back to the garage. My favorite game. Resident
[664.84s -> 671.56s]  Evil 2 inventory simulator. Yeah. It's kind of part of the fun though. I'm not gonna lie.
[672.84s -> 677.00s]  The last couple days, like yesterday and then today, it's been like kind of part of the fun.
[677.56s -> 686.76s]  So I need to go to, I mean, generator room is right here. Parking garage. So how the fuck do
[686.76s -> 693.66s]  I get down here? Straight and then down. I'm just getting back to the parking garage. Those
[693.66s -> 704.58s]  shotgun shells? No. You know what? I'm gonna board these windows up. Right? I mean like,
[704.58s -> 717.08s]  why not? I want, yeah, I want to be safe. All right. So this is gonna take us out here
[717.08s -> 720.28s]  and then we're gonna bring them right into the parking garage. I'm going to open up
[720.28s -> 746.95s]  car 7-4-2-7-2. Straight ahead. Oh, wait, it was a shotgun? What the fuck are the dogs doing
[746.95s -> 785.19s]  over here? Oh, no. Shit. Assholes. This is a loud fucking game. You know what I mean?
[785.75s -> 795.53s]  I gotta turn that down. Okay. We're looking for a car. Looking for, beep the, maybe beep the thing
[795.53s -> 830.41s]  here. What car was it? This white one right here? Which one of these cars is open? Is he
[830.41s -> 835.69s]  wearing a shower cap? Uh, no. No, he's not wearing a shower cap, I can assure you.
[836.49s -> 846.06s]  Oh, it's gun stock. Custom part for them. It's a shower cap. What am I, like a fucking
[846.06s -> 850.74s]  lunch lady? A custom part of the Matilda that allows the gun to fire three rounds
[850.74s -> 866.38s]  per pull of the trigger. This is, that's interesting looking. All right. Did it just
[866.38s -> 877.98s]  get bigger? No, it just now takes up two inventory spaces. Oh, god damn it. Whatever.
[877.98s -> 886.95s]  Okay. Well, I don't need the car on key anymore. I got my upgrade. It was foolish.
[889.02s -> 892.38s]  That's a terrible looking gun. Yeah, it does look like it was made out of like
[892.38s -> 896.06s]  nerf guns and Legos. Now what the hell does it look like? This looks like,
[896.70s -> 907.50s]  yeah, it looks like a nerf gun, like a nerf attachment. So that's that. So that we,
[907.50s -> 917.83s]  now what else do I have? I got the diamond key. Let me see. What? Back at like the main hall.
[919.14s -> 926.49s]  What was the shit that was over here? Some of these are diamond key. That's heart. Club.
[928.86s -> 933.58s]  Where's that diamond? Diamond queen, you know? Follow that queen. Follow that queen. Follow
[933.58s -> 945.37s]  that diamond queen. Second floor. Electronically locked door. Diamond door. There's a diamond
[945.37s -> 954.28s]  door over here. Five community subs from Great Canadian. Fuck club. Thank you. Thank
[954.28s -> 960.63s]  you so much, Great Canadian. Just consistently constantly adding to your tally. Thank you.
[962.34s -> 973.67s]  So, what the heck? A crank handle slot. I could go all the way. I could go over here.
[978.30s -> 983.10s]  Yeah, I'm gonna bring the crank back down to this area down here on the second floor.
[984.57s -> 995.14s]  I think that would be prudent, right? I think that would be prudent. Let's go get it. I
[995.14s -> 1000.73s]  really don't want to use this, but I might have to. So I'm gonna keep the key just because
[1000.81s -> 1010.36s]  I get overzealous. So, you know. Let's do what we need to do. Oh, there's a diamond door right
[1010.36s -> 1038.98s]  here. Let's check it out. Oh, no. This is the shooting range. Where are you? Oh,
[1038.98s -> 1051.11s]  where is this person? Where is the person? All right, let's go. I'm just gonna blow
[1051.11s -> 1063.83s]  your head off. Didn't blow your head off. Unbelievable. Fuck me. What a waste of a
[1063.83s -> 1081.08s]  shotgun bullet. Can I like stomp on the head? Does film? I think that's it. That's it. I got
[1081.08s -> 1100.31s]  film, though. This is in dead space. Why not? Oh, fuck. Well, it's okay. What's that noise?
[1101.11s -> 1107.45s]  I, why, you should be able to run over and just step there on their head.
[1108.33s -> 1120.22s]  Come on, man. Step your game up. How do I get by you? You stupid. I can't really. You
[1120.22s -> 1134.44s]  just did that to me. I can't fucking believe it. I was gonna do that to you. You're not
[1134.44s -> 1139.40s]  supposed to be able to do that to me. I was gonna do it to you. Why didn't I shoot? I,
[1139.40s -> 1144.04s]  because I, I don't, I, I, she, the animation started when she grabbed me by the fucking
[1144.04s -> 1150.94s]  chesticles. She like pulled me in with by both chest areas. I started biting me.
[1151.74s -> 1160.81s]  Dammit. I just took so much unnecessary damage. All right, so I need to go, but I did get
[1160.81s -> 1167.48s]  some film. So I need to go back to turn around up the stairs. You go up here and
[1168.12s -> 1180.55s]  break room. Okay. So I'm gonna go back this way and then this way. He's doing the end,
[1180.55s -> 1194.87s]  end of the stream voice. What? End of the stream voice. No, no, it feels bad. Stream
[1194.87s -> 1206.49s]  over. The stream is not over. Would just get started. Okay. But I need to bring
[1208.23s -> 1213.46s]  this thing. I'm going to store this thing because I don't want to use it.
[1214.71s -> 1219.67s]  That's my rare Lucario Amiibo. I can't even take it out of the box. Okay.
[1226.44s -> 1234.57s]  So we're going to go store the film too for now. I need tool. Store the herb.
[1235.37s -> 1243.61s]  I'll keep this one. This is a full health restore. So this, we're going to get back
[1243.61s -> 1247.61s]  to the crank. I'm going to keep the key and I'm going to board up a couple of windows.
[1249.69s -> 1256.63s]  That sounds good to me. Say how many saves? It saves 24 different saves from
[1257.51s -> 1263.74s]  compulsive panic saving. I can't imagine. How many saves do you get in hardcore?
[1264.54s -> 1270.63s]  Do you get like eight the whole game? Well, that would make me just absolutely livid.
[1272.36s -> 1277.72s]  I can get the, no, let me get the electrical part too. You get 20
[1278.97s -> 1286.49s]  through the whole game. That sucks. I'm going to hold on to that electrical part.
[1286.49s -> 1290.33s]  Now I know I'm going to be probably rage quitting. I'm going to rage quit the game,
[1290.33s -> 1296.97s]  right? In like 20 minutes because I'm going to need that. So I'm going to hold on to it.
[1296.97s -> 1305.30s]  I got plenty of slots for all this shit. All right, let's go. Heal? No, no, I'm not
[1305.30s -> 1309.38s]  going to heal yet. I got a full heal in my inventory. I can get one more bite taken out
[1309.38s -> 1321.08s]  of me before I have to heal. So, okay. Down and then here. So we're going to go down
[1322.95s -> 1332.28s]  out of this way. Can I get in there? Can I get in? Is there a way for me to get over
[1332.28s -> 1352.10s]  there? I'm going to board up some of these windows. How did you not get fucking staggered by that?
[1352.10s -> 1366.14s]  What? Oh my, this is just a fucking choose your own adventure game where you turn the wrong
[1366.14s -> 1387.88s]  corner and you die. That was, you could go down this into the forest or you could turn right
[1387.88s -> 1393.16s]  and go down the, the in between the rocks into the alleyway. And I picked the alleyway.
[1393.16s -> 1396.04s]  Oh, well see what happened was there were three zombies there and you died.
[1396.84s -> 1409.72s]  Oh, looks like I'm going to have to go into the forest. Why didn't I heal? Because it was,
[1409.72s -> 1414.41s]  it was a waste. It was a waste of a heal because I'm not going to get hit by any of these guys.
[1414.41s -> 1430.92s]  Now check this out. I have, no, I made sure I remember this one. Okay, let's do it again.
[1432.26s -> 1436.63s]  Let me go down the choose your own adventure hallway, which, which would do it. This door,
[1436.63s -> 1463.38s]  right? Hello, how are you? That's one down and then there's you. What the? Put it in.
[1464.28s -> 1485.67s]  I don't know what's on the wall. Oh, fuck off. You, what the guy with the fucking
[1485.67s -> 1497.77s]  internal organs coming out is still alive. The guy in like the fucking pile of bodies.
[1498.41s -> 1511.53s]  All right, we're good. That brings us to exactly where I wanted. Did I forget about him? He
[1511.53s -> 1515.13s]  should have been dead. There's no, nobody can survive what he went through. All right,
[1515.13s -> 1524.26s]  so we got to go back into the main hall and then wait, where's the fire escape?
[1526.50s -> 1535.58s]  I'm actually right next to it. So we're going to go up that way. Oh God damn it. Just leave
[1535.58s -> 1548.90s]  me alone. Why is everybody spamming P? Yeah, what's going on? Why are people writing P?
[1549.62s -> 1555.75s]  You can't go that way, but it doesn't matter. I need to just go right there. There it is.
[1556.79s -> 1576.98s]  Okay. Is there, that's exactly where I want to be. Let's crank it up. I don't know the
[1576.98s -> 1581.14s]  secret meme. I don't know any memes. I don't know what any, half the time, I don't know
[1581.14s -> 1596.38s]  what the hell everybody's talking about. Let's take it slow. There's one of those dolls.
[1600.95s -> 1609.11s]  I do hear noises. Chiropractor. That is a heart door. I don't have the key for it.
[1615.46s -> 1623.59s]  So this will take me down or up. I guess I could go to the roof maybe from here. Where
[1623.67s -> 1646.17s]  does this go? More boards. I'll just take them. Free stuff. Magnum ammo. No, that's just regular
[1646.17s -> 1657.78s]  handgun ammo. Left eye. Middle eye. Right eye. Flashbang. Change equipped sub weapon.
[1658.34s -> 1670.30s]  Is there a way I can, I'll get, there we go. I didn't know if I could put anything else there.
[1671.34s -> 1679.67s]  All right. E storage room or balcony. Let's go to the E storage room. I feel like
[1679.67s -> 1702.60s]  there's going to be a safe point in here because this is a storage room. Absolutely not. Blue,
[1702.60s -> 1713.06s]  where the fuck are you? Where is he? Where? Okay, what's this? A large gear. It's huge.
[1713.06s -> 1716.18s]  A rusty old gear. It looks like it belongs to some machine or another.
[1717.11s -> 1748.28s]  It's, that's two slots. That's unfair. Two slots. I can't get out of this door either.
[1760.57s -> 1767.66s]  Bitch. I don't even know why I shouldn't be shooting this guy. So I gotta go out,
[1767.66s -> 1778.55s]  I can go out here. No, I can't. Is every door locked up? I got the gear. Whatever the hell
[1778.55s -> 1797.42s]  that's for. There were two guys in here. Let's check the balcony. Running out of room. It's
[1797.42s -> 1812.23s]  completely gone now. But I got the gear for, what is it? What is that for? Oh, this is done.
[1812.23s -> 1825.58s]  All right, so I have one more spot. I could go down from here. I'm good playing ammo. Let's go
[1825.58s -> 1844.98s]  down. There's not going to be a monster just sitting right here, is there? Get rid of your
[1844.98s -> 1863.40s]  handgun. No. And why does Leon have a little BB gun? He's shooting little rocks out of this
[1863.40s -> 1877.43s]  gun. Not even bullets. Water? Okay, well, obviously missing a pipe. Is there a pipe lying
[1877.51s -> 1887.35s]  around here? Do I gotta come back later and get the pipe? Water valve lever. I'm gonna have to
[1887.35s -> 1903.26s]  come back here and stick a pipe up there. All right, so this is a door I have not. Let me
[1903.26s -> 1907.02s]  know. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me check. Because I haven't been out here right now. I'm
[1907.02s -> 1916.71s]  like on the roof. I can go that way. Hold on. So many branching paths in this story.
[1922.44s -> 1929.98s]  Well, this would not be here for no reason, so. I guess I could combine. I'm gonna combine.
[1930.86s -> 1935.88s]  Is it poise? There's a poison monster here. There's gonna be a poison enemy.

[2217.54s -> 2244.52s]  up here. All right, so wait, would that do anything with this? Oh! So what does that,
[2244.52s -> 2250.54s]  what did that do for me? There's no item in here or nothing in here? How could there not
[2250.54s -> 2281.58s]  be something in here? How could there not be something in there? That's bullshit. Jesus Christ.
[2282.54s -> 2292.39s]  Okay, um, so like Jermarumble Rorschach is now facing me. Fucking Dick Tracy is coming after me
[2292.39s -> 2303.94s]  now. What am I supposed, is this an edit, what do I do about this guy? Does he just fucking chase
[2303.94s -> 2316.28s]  you around? No, of course they had to add like a nemesis. Oh my fucking God. Should I shoot
[2316.28s -> 2353.19s]  him? Okay, well he's there, so that's why they put the auto save here. Okay, because
[2354.31s -> 2360.49s]  fucking Slender Man and Dick Tracy had a baby. All right, I gotta bait him out here.
[2363.19s -> 2375.13s]  Jesus Christ! Come on, climb up the broken ladder! Okay, hold on, wait for him. I'm just
[2375.13s -> 2388.23s]  gonna run by him and then run by the helicopter. All right, does he have any
[2388.23s -> 2400.44s]  stretchy powers or anything? He doesn't have any stretchy powers, right? Where the fuck am I?
[2402.28s -> 2418.97s]  Ah, straight through the waiting room? Because this is open, right? Lose him in the main hall.
[2420.74s -> 2435.35s]  He does, he does not follow in here. All right, I lost him. Yeah, this is like a sanctuary. He
[2435.35s -> 2453.74s]  can't come in here. Okay, so I have the club key. I got some jewels. I have some healing.
[2455.56s -> 2476.42s]  You're safe in a horror game. I don't think I'm fairly safe right now. I could flashbang him.

[6801.17s -> 6810.78s]  away from the barrel all right the tilled is pretty decked out right
[6810.78s -> 6819.38s]  now he put me can't believe that worked when you use a safe you they're not
[6819.38s -> 6822.66s]  telling me the numbers to go to they're telling me how many notches in a
[6822.66s -> 6831.22s]  direction all right so out through here just all the way down through the
[6831.22s -> 6838.55s]  whole hall up the stairs through the storage room let's just get off the
[6838.55s -> 6855.40s]  stairs first here we go here bang a left go through I thought he couldn't
[6855.40s -> 6879.53s]  get in these rooms what oh you asshole somebody's gave five community subs I'll
[6879.53s -> 6891.73s]  stop panicking just shoot him down to one knee there we go let's go
[6891.73s -> 6902.26s]  somebody just write envy aim like Nevada what do you what and a would
[6902.26s -> 6908.36s]  like what you know now we're picking a states out now first it was like oh
[6908.36s -> 6918.18s]  and a oh you now we're picking actual states out oh like oh it's you
[6918.22s -> 6924.29s]  he's got real like fucking like ma we're gonna pick the state now what are the
[6924.29s -> 6950.54s]  what are the top players in Nevada what's their aim like he's down on
[6950.54s -> 6964.58s]  one knee just get out that takes us up to where I want to be I have all
[6964.58s -> 6971.37s]  the items I need right all right here we are we should go get East storage
[6971.37s -> 6978.17s]  room now and then there's the hall into the clock tower you better not
[6978.93s -> 7003.02s]  I knew it it was him no it's not him look just like him I don't care I don't
[7003.02s -> 7007.98s]  care I just need to get to where I need to go I don't care I don't care
[7007.98s -> 7020.74s]  okay he's there's nowhere for him to break through a wall right there's no
[7020.74s -> 7038.26s]  walls he can break through get it in there turn it do whatever you need to
[7038.26s -> 7062.62s]  do turn and then I need to do it here too right right here doesn't fit
[7062.62s -> 7083.95s]  I guess I can I just to go up then where did that drop down there's like a
[7083.95s -> 7094.40s]  ladder thing that came down here where the hell did that drop down is my
[7094.40s -> 7123.57s]  just dumb there it is well all right so here's this thing small gear well
[7123.57s -> 7127.45s]  now that I guess that makes sense of what it put the large gear in here
[7127.45s -> 7139.62s]  turn that one what does that do I'm not entirely sure it looks like it's
[7139.62s -> 7152.83s]  running it's it's turn I've turned it on okay so now this goes in the other one
[7152.83s -> 7175.66s]  and I should open and drop it down maybe so now that works well if I was
[7175.66s -> 7178.82s]  gonna attract somebody over here that's how you do it
[7178.82s -> 7186.64s]  there's the electrical part I now both of these I was told to get them both
[7186.64s -> 7193.78s]  I don't have to write a report on this you break through that door I
[7193.78s -> 7214.07s]  swear to God should be two there's an electronic part two of them okay
[7214.11s -> 7218.46s]  obtained electronic part obtained power plant part and now I can go back to the
[7218.46s -> 7230.54s]  parking garage and give me a second I need the other one so how what's the
[7230.54s -> 7238.89s]  fastest way I could go through here through and then down which would
[7238.89s -> 7253.74s]  bring me here put me in the library and then plus two for Leon did he make
[7253.74s -> 7259.99s]  he made a funny joke yeah I guess he did so that would put it would put me
[7259.99s -> 7267.47s]  down here I need to go from there to this library down that brings to the
[7267.47s -> 7273.30s]  West office and I need to go down from there's only one way to go and that's
[7273.30s -> 7281.38s]  is not through the main hall can I go down from the main hall or is it
[7281.38s -> 7287.27s]  easier for me to go through like for instance from down here so like from
[7287.27s -> 7294.86s]  over here I'm pretty sure I can get down there yeah I can get them from
[7294.86s -> 7312.88s]  here right maybe I can't do it so I'm doing some tuber commentary looks at
[7312.88s -> 7318.08s]  yeah okay because yeah that's what I thought so down here so I gotta go I'm
[7318.08s -> 7322.49s]  gonna get just get back to the main hall I've done what needs to be done
[7322.49s -> 7332.52s]  so down the stairs into the library and then out to the main hall let's
[7332.52s -> 7356.72s]  go for it I'm so nervous right now because just no no I gotta go this way
[7356.72s -> 7365.65s]  I need to go East storage room down down down okay East storage room it is
[7365.65s -> 7376.35s]  and then is there okay there is the break room is right there all right
[7376.35s -> 7389.75s]  straight left straight left I'm just gonna go out through there here we go
[7389.75s -> 7392.77s]  he's probably gonna be right here just load up the guns just in case
[7392.77s -> 7404.88s]  something happens straight all the way down left right I wish I could peek
[7408.96s -> 7420.86s]  don't break through a door don't break through a door don't break through a
[7420.86s -> 7433.22s]  door don't break out through like a door straight through don't break out
[7433.22s -> 7460.85s]  through this door and down down brings me here down again fire escape down
[7460.85s -> 7474.69s]  here is here and then I'm going out to the main hall so from here I can
[7474.69s -> 7482.68s]  yeah no I can't I can't I need because this is gonna bring me here
[7482.68s -> 7488.93s]  and this is gonna press room bathroom break room I can I guess I could do it
[7488.93s -> 7492.37s]  I could do press room through but this but there's so many aliens over there
[7492.37s -> 7557.68s]  we'll do that fuck it so press room so left straight left straight left okay
[7557.68s -> 7568.50s]  I'm so compulsive right now around the corner hello all right I made it I
[7568.70s -> 7581.30s]  made it I'm good okay we're safe oh I got my storage unit in here I got the
[7581.30s -> 7587.27s]  safe point right there now it's time to finish this give me the power panel
[7587.27s -> 7594.29s]  parts I have a heel I'm all right just reload I need some more handgun ammo I
[7594.29s -> 7601.05s]  might just make it yeah I'm gonna make it why not just sitting in here
[7601.05s -> 7621.92s]  okay any more items I don't think so maybe the dongle don't think so so
[7621.92s -> 7628.08s]  I got the two pieces I got the two power pieces game is saved now let's do
[7628.08s -> 7633.30s]  another part of the map stream let's go I need to go down so I
[7633.30s -> 7640.55s]  have to go from here this is not gonna do anything for me is it can I
[7640.55s -> 7658.52s]  go down from there would you look at that would you look at that I made
[7658.52s -> 7669.16s]  it here now where did these go I this two of them there's the parking
[7669.16s -> 7674.83s]  garage there's the card reader there's the electronic door panel so I have to
[7674.83s -> 7679.71s]  go all the way down back into the jail get that guy's key card and then leave
[7679.71s -> 7700.16s]  through the parking garage it seems like a lot is that guy like I can't go
[7700.16s -> 7708.11s]  underground right he can't he he'll get stuck second floor basement yeah
[7708.11s -> 7717.67s]  it's through here because remember that isn't the panels all the way down
[7717.67s -> 7737.09s]  here and then he has like that reader no okay it's down here there it is
[7737.09s -> 7746.24s]  all right get key I gotta get out of here okay put in the power devices put
[7746.24s -> 7757.92s]  them both in and then we have to play one of these games so it's got to
[7757.92s -> 7788.22s]  light up here here it's gotta come from here not these already lit up
[7788.22s -> 7808.37s]  no it's gotta go across down from here it can only come from that side so it
[7808.37s -> 7819.24s]  has to come from this side so the question is how to get this okay
[7819.24s -> 7830.27s]  there's one I gotta get the other one to do the same thing there's time to
[7830.27s -> 7841.90s]  run toilet Ben's memo the station's swimming with monsters even here I can
[7841.90s -> 7846.06s]  hear their cries but it's not the zombies I'm afraid of code name tyrant
[7846.06s -> 7850.94s]  the ultimate bioweapon developed by those bastards in the utmost secrecy to
[7850.94s -> 7855.38s]  think that there might be the thing might be wandering around here chances
[7855.38s -> 7861.22s]  are they've ordered to wipe out the witnesses that would be our friend
[7861.22s -> 7869.05s]  first aid spray good and this is gonna activate some kind of event so I
[7869.05s -> 7874.29s]  could be ready to run the hell out of here and read the card and get
[7874.29s -> 7923.34s]  the fuck out of the parking garage cut off the interview interview
[7923.34s -> 7932.12s]  transcript we just heard it so parking garage key card take it and escape the
[7932.12s -> 7937.92s]  parking garage what are they after this is where it gets fucking hairy probably

[8050.15s -> 8064.68s]  game see he's alive he's unkillable we didn't see him die on screen it
[8064.68s -> 8072.36s]  means he's still alive yeah and this I was hoping you could explain what's
[8072.36s -> 8095.16s]  on it maybe after I hear it ridiculous oh okay I need to see him dead no guys
[8095.16s -> 8106.69s]  that's not how this works what else we got I need I'm okay with healing we
[8106.69s -> 8111.45s]  reload I need shotgun bullets I need an upgrade to the shotgun it's just a
[8111.45s -> 8128.30s]  standard shotgun that's crazy oh at least I can have like a side
[8128.30s -> 8132.18s]  relief I didn't have to worry about that guy following me everywhere I go
[8132.18s -> 8155.72s]  for the last hour how do I talk to Ada Ada Ada can we talk is that the intel

[8243.36s -> 8248.24s]  long barrel I did just mention shotgun upgrade and how I haven't found one and
[8248.24s -> 8252.80s]  now here's a shotgun upgrade custom part of the w8 70 that ups its max
[8252.80s -> 8258.84s]  capacity to 8 less spread makes each shot more powerful well that sounds
[8258.84s -> 8269.47s]  pretty good to me and it gives you eight shots good nice okay fancy
[8269.47s -> 8286.08s]  can I take up my flashlight only five rounds in the gun store no I'm not gonna
[8286.08s -> 8290.56s]  hurt you I said don't move who are you I'm just passing through I'm gonna ask

[8312.60s -> 8321.81s]  terminate her before she turns terminate it's my fucking daughter she's gonna bite
[8321.81s -> 8327.08s]  him in the back just let them be by the time I realized something that was
[8327.08s -> 8330.24s]  wrong the entire city was infested with
[8330.24s -> 8336.40s]  zombies I told you to stay put no original voice actor either but the
[8336.40s -> 8363.15s]  fuck you're supposed to know something how did this happen huh and by the
[8363.19s -> 8382.81s]  way what are you doing here by his fucking ear is gonna rip off see I'm
[8382.81s -> 8418.24s]  gonna I'll get away from the for the touching moment here you know it's one
[8418.24s -> 8427.99s]  thing to keep the truth from me but why him no it didn't happen I want to
[8428.19s -> 8434.31s]  oh wait oh fuck okay whoever's behind it oops helping people like them that's
[8434.31s -> 8442.66s]  why I joined the force I thought I was gonna get bitten eaten behind the door
[8442.66s -> 8448.76s]  my mission is to take down umbrella's entire operation we may not make it
[8448.76s -> 8457.15s]  out whatever it takes to save this city count me in I did that was
[8457.15s -> 8461.99s]  poorly timed with me do I thought it was gonna be him screaming because she
[8461.99s -> 8467.55s]  like we muffled screams from behind the door like he like she ate him
[8467.59s -> 8492.78s]  all right listen okay what are you doing here I wasn't trying to make that like
[8492.78s -> 8498.06s]  a joke I'm going to look I'm going off the original game in the original
[8498.06s -> 8502.90s]  game that happened to that guy so there was no daughter it was just the
[8502.90s -> 8505.62s]  guy I thought that was gonna happen again this is supposed to be remake
[8505.62s -> 8524.67s]  of the second game that games older than most of chat yeah it is now it is
[8524.67s -> 8533.26s]  and that's why I'm looking for a net Birkin she's the one at umbrella
[8533.26s -> 8549.79s]  responsible for unleashing the virus I'm going to bring her down okay I
[8549.79s -> 8559.77s]  thought there was a I thought she just walked off the edge I was looking
[8559.77s -> 8566.78s]  over at Chad Nick I glanced over here based on what you said the sewer
[8566.78s -> 8581.40s]  seems fitting well said after you gee thanks now let's go we have just gone
[8581.40s -> 8594.14s]  all the way down can't imagine a real scientist being down here come on
[8594.14s -> 8598.34s]  second sewers are run by the city how could they have a facility without
[8598.34s -> 8611.24s]  the authorities knowing I why do I have to take the lead the whole time
[8616.06s -> 8621.20s]  first impressions of the game I think it's fucking great no sorry about the
[8621.20s -> 8630.24s]  upward I meant to say Jesus that an earthquake it's gonna be that guy the
[8630.24s -> 8637.49s]  tyrants gonna be back that's why you check every corner I told you if you
[8637.49s -> 8647.80s]  don't die on screen you don't actually die
[8647.96s -> 8656.74s]  okay well that was a I think that was sick trash moving somebody dumped some
[8656.74s -> 8666.80s]  trash down here I told you I played the first second game you know you
[8666.80s -> 8671.91s]  have to say it like that now I played the first second one okay I got heels
[8671.91s -> 8676.26s]  I got two full heels I wonder if it's worth taking up the lightning hawk for
[8676.26s -> 8693.88s]  this because I only have 11 bullets for maybe although I kind of feel
[8693.88s -> 8699.04s]  like I'll need these at some point later ancient Greek German what are you
[8699.04s -> 8704.36s]  talking about no no don't even take it let's go I can kill this thing and not
[8704.36s -> 8712.75s]  take one point of damage so is Ada still with me what did she end up
[8712.75s -> 8720.45s]  leaving it's gonna like snowball down the whole hallway isn't it well
[8720.45s -> 8746.06s]  there's nothing else here Ada coming all right you you're filling me with
[8746.06s -> 8762.83s]  ammo she's still coming right again no chance you're stuck with me to the end
[8762.83s -> 8769.08s]  all right here comes that was a safe checkpoint so this is definitely
[8769.08s -> 8775.76s]  something going on right now it is I got two full heels you sure this is
[8775.76s -> 8781.99s]  the right way nine shotgun shots unfortunately she's gonna wave by and
[8781.99s -> 8800.30s]  I'm gonna have to fight this thing wait there
[8800.30s -> 8825.36s]  oh I'm controlling it now holy shit watch apparently can I shoot behind me
[8825.36s -> 8845.87s]  or something shoot it yep load up does it hurt you chew on that
[8845.87s -> 8859.34s]  oh yeah son of a bitch got two grenades looking good so I've made
[8859.70s -> 8871.51s]  kind of stuck down here what the hell was just get up here hey thanks for the
[8871.51s -> 8880.31s]  ladder was that the I was kind of expecting a fight there I guess it was
[8880.31s -> 8884.47s]  just a fun interesting thing to see on the virus and turned people into
[8884.47s -> 8889.63s]  monsters not reptiles their point I'm just impressed you made it in one
[8890.15s -> 8895.95s]  who flushed a grenade in the toilet somebody trying to pull like a prank
[8895.95s -> 8911.08s]  where's he down in the underground lab so let me get this straight
[8911.08s -> 8918.76s]  umbrella sells monsters like that to who our military somebody oh it's not
[8918.76s -> 8923.80s]  looking that's fine that's just a stain and Annette is who makes the
[8923.80s -> 8929.28s]  viruses scary as that alligator was Annette is far more dangerous to me
[8929.32s -> 8951.23s]  all right so we've made it underground so what do you want me to do now Ada is
[8951.23s -> 8956.20s]  this where when this is where part waves when we're gonna part waves the
[8956.20s -> 8974.01s]  safe point two in succession no box though interestingly enough new
[8974.01s -> 8982.23s]  character yourself she's who we're looking for my grain doing yeah my
[8982.27s -> 8989.44s]  good need to dispose of it just a little tired from it I'm good that's not
[8989.44s -> 9008.00s]  gonna happen I'm warning you doctor oh yeah hey she did cause like a little
[9008.00s -> 9012.76s]  fire didn't expect that from a scientist yeah I'm gonna burn this it
[9012.76s -> 9018.68s]  didn't do anything Leon forget about me just go you could have stopped her
[9018.72s -> 9033.36s]  before she gets away I play as Ada we character switching here we are
[9033.36s -> 9038.29s]  character switching now I'm right outside the facility in pursuit of a
[9038.29s -> 9054.12s]  net it's not on her it must be in the nest my guns once it's in hand I'll
[9054.12s -> 9068.76s]  call for extraction time to play as Ada what do you have run Annette but
[9068.76s -> 9074.44s]  you can't can I just steal all the stuff on my character because I mean
[9074.44s -> 9078.64s]  for real nine bullets in a nine millimeter you're essentially this is
[9078.64s -> 9084.85s]  the worst weapon I could possibly have right now so this is broken messed up
[9084.85s -> 9089.29s]  let me just check around because down here is a lead ladder but wait wait
[9089.29s -> 9097.11s]  wait wait wait wait go up I don't want to miss bullets especially at
[9097.11s -> 9105.46s]  this stage in the game here nothing right nothing okay we're just gonna go
[9105.46s -> 9125.90s]  up the stairs just throw a blanket on him he'll be fine no a price
[9125.90s -> 9133.31s]  scanner compare prices use the EMF visualizer track wiring and hack
[9133.31s -> 9140.15s]  electronic equipment hack electronic equipment okay it's secret weapon time
[9140.15s -> 9159.37s]  well it says on my app this is $15 less a target you turn it off turn
[9159.37s -> 9175.68s]  off am I not supposed to climb that well I was supposed to turn it on why
[9175.68s -> 9184.86s]  would I want to turn it on wouldn't want to climb up there oh I get it
[9184.86s -> 9191.07s]  I can do both I get it I thought I could just climb up with it off
[9191.07s -> 9207.76s]  candy from a baby what you're don't burn yourself wait hackable object oh no
[9207.76s -> 9220.76s]  listen just bugs no there's a buyer there we're gonna get hackable not
[9220.76s -> 9247.48s]  hackable hackable okay now what we are in there's only one way to go
[9247.52s -> 9253.04s]  straight but there's probably stuff there is something September inspection I
[9253.04s -> 9257.40s]  already put in request last week but we absolutely must have a replacement ID
[9257.40s -> 9262.32s]  wristband we need one to gain access to certain areas of the main facility
[9262.32s -> 9265.81s]  in other words me and my crew can't get to the places we need to in order
[9265.81s -> 9268.79s]  to do our job so I don't want to hear anyone accusing us of slacking
[9268.79s -> 9272.96s]  off so we got to get an ID wristband to get in certain rooms I
[9272.96s -> 9279.63s]  think certain doors nothing else here I'm not even gonna fight this guy why
[9279.63s -> 9307.88s]  would I checking for items I can't hackable door it is sir you're

[9719.33s -> 9722.21s]  wristband that's just arrived we can finally begin our survey of the
[9722.21s -> 9727.27s]  demolition area as to the report from the other day about the
[9727.27s -> 9729.95s]  incinerator it's nothing really probably just a large piece of left of
[9729.95s -> 9737.16s]  trash I'll go take a look myself after I wrap up the report wristband we can
[9737.16s -> 9752.14s]  finally do our survey the incinerator so can I turn this on that's

[12125.51s -> 12134.90s]  I guess it's kind of hard to spoil a game that technically released like 18
[12134.90s -> 12144.46s]  years ago and that I've seen like I knew what that was I'm gonna store
[12144.46s -> 12166.48s]  these I guess I could do another maybe just another red and green no I'm not

[13384.22s -> 13402.25s]  had it and I'm like looking around I like was on the way out too so
[13402.25s -> 13407.38s]  speaking of on the way out this is the way to get out of this so I need
[13407.38s -> 13421.08s]  I just like screwed myself so bad because now I can't leave this door is
[13421.08s -> 13428.24s]  open but this one's not oh I hate shit like this this shit drives me fucking
[13428.24s -> 13436.51s]  crazy because I have to get out of the door over here oh and I did it in
[13436.51s -> 13447.25s]  reverse and now I have no fucking idea I had pretty much had it done
[13447.25s -> 13453.90s]  and now oh I hate I hate shit like this with a passion like where's the
[13453.90s -> 13481.15s]  actual fucking exit do I actually have to do this again and drop down no yeah
[13481.15s -> 13484.95s]  I literally have no idea what's going on I'm not gonna lie like I have
[13484.95s -> 13493.34s]  absolutely not a single clue what's going on because now I can go this way
[13493.34s -> 13511.33s]  but I can't leave I have to ah and it's so dark too it just causing my
[13511.33s -> 13517.34s]  brain so many problems the way is the plug that I just plugged it in I
[13517.34s -> 13519.90s]  wish I could turn a light is there a light in this room I can turn on oh
[13524.54s -> 13527.78s]  the darkness is killing me it's I'm every the room is spinning around in
[13527.78s -> 13579.38s]  circles okay I have to go through god damn it I have to unlock this door
[13579.38s -> 13601.26s]  okay so to unlock this door I need this one because then that will let me
[13601.26s -> 13616.82s]  give the opportunity to I don't think this can this even open it okay so
[13616.82s -> 13622.18s]  now this door needs to be unlocked which where can I get that fucking plug
[13622.18s -> 13640.96s]  from so I can take this from here now and then open this is the heart this
[13640.96s -> 13644.56s]  is the struggle it's just spatial awareness and darkness is just it kills
[13644.56s -> 13657.87s]  me so I have to take this one out and put this one but this one that
[13657.87s -> 13690.66s]  will close this door oh I can't I can't do it I literally can't do it
[13690.66s -> 13694.66s]  my brain is too small just click on the fucking screen and show me where to go
[13694.66s -> 13704.93s]  I like I my brain literally cannot do this puzzle I'm no I'm okay you guys
[13704.93s -> 13708.57s]  are gonna guide me because seriously like the darkness in the in the in
[13708.57s -> 13712.49s]  the plugs and spatial awareness is it's actually impossible for me to do
[13712.49s -> 13720.69s]  I am brain dead so here's what we're gonna do am I go direct me
[13720.69s -> 13757.39s]  straight straight left okay left okay take King grab no take other piece okay
[13757.39s -> 13789.21s]  take King taking put King in this slot fucking with me now yes please yes

[13959.34s -> 13964.05s]  not a funny joke I thought it was a pretty funny absolutely not a joke I'm
[13964.05s -> 13966.97s]  really that stupid I can't do it I can't do puzzles like that they're
[13966.97s -> 13972.17s]  impossible for my brain see how fast it did like that did that in like eight
[13972.17s -> 13976.69s]  seconds no gates closing dark I can't no no way I was pretending it
[13976.69s -> 13984.37s]  was a joke so now I gotta get the hell out of here and I have to go
[13984.37s -> 13990.73s]  god I gotta go back through the I thought that just had bottom Weasley I
[13990.73s -> 14014.65s]  was like why does it say Weasley I can now open that door I still want to get
[14014.65s -> 14018.61s]  hit by the stupid thing all the blobs are dead besides this one right not
[14018.61s -> 14021.93s]  this one the one in the middle wait what the fuck did it go there was
[14021.93s -> 14035.90s]  one it was just right here did I make it out of there are you serious
[14035.90s -> 14045.57s]  nothing else right just get the hell out of this wait did I try dropped
[14045.57s -> 14071.94s]  it down my climb over this fuck did I make it over here no no no that's
[14071.94s -> 14080.70s]  where it was okay this give me the fuck out of like another dark soul
[14080.70s -> 14083.43s]  swamp
[14104.76s -> 14118.93s]  ruin you god let's go do another puzzle they got all the pieces what
[14118.93s -> 14132.72s]  difficulty is he playing on normal this is just normal I'm gonna go back
[14132.76s -> 14143.78s]  up right what would the laugh laugh at me you're you played it on normal too
[14143.78s -> 14164.80s]  didn't you on your first playthrough ever finally how we doing on box space
[14164.80s -> 14175.13s]  I got this chemical flamethrower no regular I guess I could make a super
[14175.13s -> 14179.77s]  heal not really necessary at the moment so I'm gonna store this
[14179.77s -> 14188.10s]  because I don't think I need it right now so now I have one two so let's
[14188.10s -> 14202.75s]  just let's take a look let's take them all out what does it say pretty sure the
[14202.75s -> 14209.04s]  rook and knight are on the same wall okay so this pawn I know where the pawn
[14209.04s -> 14224.17s]  goes on goes in here and night goes in here so it says the pretty sure the
[14224.17s -> 14228.37s]  rook and knight are on the same wall the bishop and the Queen aren't next to
[14228.37s -> 14232.33s]  each other Queen and rook were opposite each other so let's do it
[14232.33s -> 14234.81s]  pretty sure the rook and knight are the same wall let's put the rook on
[14234.81s -> 14244.74s]  here just just to have it on there this is a rook just put it in that leaves
[14244.74s -> 14250.58s]  one space here bishop and Queen are not extras of the Queen and rook were
[14250.58s -> 14254.72s]  opposite each other so Queen and rook opposite so the Queen has to go on
[14254.72s -> 14266.97s]  this side that's the Queen Queen the bishop and the Queen are not next
[14266.97s -> 14272.94s]  to each other okay so that means the this is not the
[14272.94s -> 14276.38s]  bishop this is the Kings the Kings over here and the bishop is over here
[14276.38s -> 14288.88s]  and then maybe but let me walk around in a fucking circle doing the open the
[14288.88s -> 14306.00s]  gate puzzle for like 18 minutes all right let me save it I'm gonna do it
[14306.00s -> 14318.74s]  on everything so shotgun no not a whole lot of bullets I'm gonna keep
[14318.74s -> 14323.28s]  the chemical flamethrower I'm gonna store the key for now no wait isn't
[14323.28s -> 14336.03s]  there there's a lock somewhere over here it's right here is that key
[14336.07s -> 14355.54s]  for key to a section of the sewers sewer no entry zone I don't know if
[14355.54s -> 14362.60s]  that's a waste of my time to go all the way back here water injection
[14362.60s -> 14367.90s]  chamber or workers break room because right now I'm down here and that means
[14367.90s -> 14375.98s]  I have to go up I don't know if that's worth going to get if there's
[14375.98s -> 14383.93s]  like five shotgun shells there I'm gonna be pretty pissed off because
[14383.93s -> 14388.60s]  that means I have to go out all the way through here again and then up
[14388.60s -> 14412.64s]  there why not up there up here like socket I guess I don't care now I don't
[14412.64s -> 14424.68s]  think I care to be honest no I want that all right heel of not that great
[14424.68s -> 14437.16s]  on the ammo department at the moment I got two good full heels it is
[14437.16s -> 14441.04s]  important it is it is in this all right fine I'll do it let's just go
[14441.04s -> 14447.60s]  open it this five shotgun shells in here you're all in big trouble so
[14447.60s -> 14456.41s]  that means I have to go out here and then down or maybe can I go up from
[14456.41s -> 14476.64s]  here you need a plug doesn't matter which plug here just just a plug so I
[14476.64s -> 14506.98s]  need to this door stays open I need the rook okay so I have the rook I'm
[14506.98s -> 14511.24s]  just gonna go open the door now the question is what's the fastest way to
[14511.24s -> 14516.47s]  get to that door here's the upper waterway I have to get I have to
[14516.47s -> 14527.85s]  get here so I have to cross this right see if I can get there from here
[14527.85s -> 14537.90s]  maybe it should go up up from here and then I have to walk all the way
[14537.90s -> 14578.42s]  around oh that sucks that's so far hold on let me see see if I can
[14578.42s -> 14584.34s]  reliably get there fast from this way if I go left I go from there I
[14584.34s -> 14593.64s]  wonder let's see I don't want to use a bunch of bullets I don't waste a
[14593.76s -> 14623.66s]  of bullets can I get there from here no I can't get there from here shit so
[14623.66s -> 14626.30s]  confirm this with my brain here because I want to make sure I'm not
[14626.30s -> 14633.06s]  gonna do something stupid if I go down here and then to the lift that takes
[14633.06s -> 14640.82s]  me up to here and then from here to here right I just want to make sure
[14640.82s -> 14664.59s]  that that's what's happening it is called the workers rift don't get up
[14664.59s -> 14679.57s]  all right open that door I hope this is worth it or you're gonna see me go
[14679.57s -> 14689.02s]  like this I'm gonna make a fist and I'm gonna squeeze it so then that opens
[14689.02s -> 14692.90s]  the door up here all right I hope it's worth it
[14692.90s -> 14716.06s]  shit from all right let me in all right we got gunpowder not impressed so
[14716.06s -> 14738.31s]  far empty nine handgun bullets a jazz festival flyer SZF that's the password
[14738.31s -> 14770.65s]  to somebody's locker okay interesting so what's this what the hell where am I
[14770.65s -> 14806.94s]  going special weapons case underground stairs what the fuck I can't open
[14806.94s -> 14811.54s]  that this is this is the bottom all right this leads all the way back up to
[14811.54s -> 14820.34s]  the police station yeah weird so now the whole thing is connected I guess
[14820.34s -> 14838.63s]  that wait this is the badge will fit in there I gotta get that badge then
[14838.63s -> 14856.30s]  all right so now I'm gonna go into here up still go upstairs what is that
[14856.30s -> 14886.28s]  an upgrade for don't forget the film I mean is it okay all right film USB
[14886.28s -> 14913.13s]  dongle oh shit what is that for wait hold on nice okay this thing's probably
[14913.13s -> 14921.18s]  already this goes back out to the main hall it still can be used
[14921.18s -> 14944.41s]  somewhere excellent so then now here's the main hall that's pretty cool all
[14944.41s -> 14951.23s]  right eight is probably dead well we we didn't need her anyways we're on our
[14951.23s -> 14957.42s]  own mission let me go open this shit up actually wait what about the film
[14957.42s -> 14971.84s]  as we go develop it saved all right dark room so I'm gonna go through
[14971.84s -> 14988.66s]  here and then bang right which will bring us to right there oh shit the
[14988.66s -> 14999.59s]  lickers I forgot no no no don't die here don't you die here don't you die
[14999.59s -> 15031.70s]  in here okay film hiding place with desks where are those desks like the
[15036.94s -> 15055.68s]  the offices yeah but I mean which one up here hidden well what's even hidden up
[15055.68s -> 15060.48s]  there cuz he talking about that that's quite that's a journey for me to go on
[15060.48s -> 15067.42s]  right now hold on if I go up from here I'm gonna get myself fucking killed
[15067.42s -> 15084.24s]  so I'm just gonna try I'm gonna go up the stairs from here and we'll go
[15084.24s -> 15102.04s]  to the stars office stars office straight through thing left wait
[15102.04s -> 15122.34s]  lickers I didn't how did I miss this hold on a second no I can't go so I
[15122.34s -> 15132.26s]  could go to the showers there are lickers all over the place here I'm
[15132.26s -> 15150.95s]  gonna walk through here and then through the door I know there's at
[15150.95s -> 15161.93s]  least one up here I've shot this thing ten times straight and it's on
[15161.93s -> 15191.62s]  the left is don't all right so where was that it was somebody's desk with
[15191.62s -> 15199.22s]  coffee on it let me take a look there's a stereo player and then a phone with
[15199.22s -> 15224.70s]  some pens phone with some pens on it okay right here wooden box a slightly
[15224.70s -> 15232.72s]  heavy wooden box all right that's all I got a piece of wood come on I can
[15232.72s -> 15238.78s]  open this red dot sight for the lightning hog a custom part for the
[15239.66s -> 15252.55s]  lightning fast aiming all right pretty cool oh so then from that's sick but
[15252.55s -> 15265.86s]  the other one is what the boom box I gotta get back out to the main hall
[15265.86s -> 15271.86s]  and then the first floor it was like down here right East office or press
[15271.86s -> 15285.11s]  room what did I just got more film oh what kind of wild goose chase is
[15285.19s -> 15293.14s]  putting me on this is like a treasure hunt I get the USB to go in the
[15293.14s -> 15296.82s]  computer I've got to go check the press room I got to watch out for the
[15296.82s -> 15317.37s]  liquor all right so I got back through back into the dark room or maybe not
[15317.37s -> 15324.77s]  yeah so I gotta go back to get to the main hall again it's gonna mean
[15324.77s -> 15329.49s]  keep keep searching the desk what there's like hidden prompts
[15329.49s -> 15333.46s]  everywhere or something I don't get it search desk search the desk again
[15333.46s -> 15347.02s]  there's nothing here missed desk one you just you baiting me all right I'm
[15347.02s -> 15350.58s]  gonna do the same thing it's gonna go down from here and we're gonna develop

[15754.31s -> 15766.46s]  and is that it those two clips no all right so I this is great custom part
[15766.46s -> 15769.38s]  for the lightning Hawk this ball barrel reduces recoil and it imparts
[15769.38s -> 15775.24s]  extra speed to bullets increasing damage so this thing is decked out now
[15775.24s -> 15782.77s]  it's two slots let's see it this is the kind of gun that you have to
[15782.77s -> 15795.68s]  actually be very careful I only have 11 bullets that's a last boss weapon if
[15795.68s -> 15803.67s]  it is you know if I've ever seen one this thing is now done goodbye all
[15803.67s -> 15809.79s]  right let me go save it combine this shit get things in a box wait no

[15880.95s -> 15907.97s]  blue herbs I gotta bring these back anyways um what do I do with these
[15907.97s -> 15915.80s]  herbs this is anti-poison I could combine three of them again but I'm
[15915.80s -> 15920.83s]  not sure it's even worth doing that it can't be used as it has become
[15920.83s -> 15927.40s]  can you do red and blue red and blue does like Constitution right what does
[15927.40s -> 15952.35s]  red and blue actually do for you so I've got two complete superheels red
[15952.35s -> 15957.01s]  and blue I'm gonna do red and blue I'm just I want to know what it does
[15957.01s -> 15970.24s]  okay so this is like a guard so it's a defense boost so I'm just gonna do
[15970.24s -> 15978.27s]  it again no no I'm gonna wait for a green I'll wait for a green to do
[15978.27s -> 15996.07s]  this I am so slightly ready to go let me save and we'll go back to what we
[15996.07s -> 15998.83s]  were doing which I honestly it was so long ago I don't remember what the
[15998.83s -> 16004.73s]  hell are you doing you know always add the green after idiot but I like
[16004.73s -> 16009.24s]  the way it looks in my inventory I like the way it looks in my inventory
[16009.24s -> 16019.05s]  there's also the other door that I need to open it's on the other side
[16019.05s -> 16038.68s]  of the plug-in down all right so well was it this way yes it was was
[16038.68s -> 16061.51s]  it that was it's an interesting shortcut though Ada is fucking dead no
[16061.51s -> 16069.62s]  she's not she's gonna be just fine she texted me she said lol spike
[16069.62s -> 16078.60s]  sticking out of leg help I said be there soon she said how soon with like
[16078.60s -> 16084.68s]  a kind of a slant like mmm said 30 minutes text it back can you stop at

[16105.28s -> 16133.23s]  this way plug in so it's the rook right what's in this room hopefully
[16133.23s -> 16142.72s]  something worth spending about the last 35 minutes doing it looks to be
[16142.72s -> 16151.89s]  well let's super bullets gunpowder gunpowder that's the only thing in this
[16151.89s -> 16162.73s]  room so not terrible I could make some more bullets with the miss
[16162.73s -> 16172.09s]  something what I miss in this room I don't see anything too bad that's not
[16172.53s -> 16192.64s]  spray I like those back up back through let's go take me back to where I was so
[16192.64s -> 16207.36s]  I can go save Ada do not attack me the slug monster is gonna be right here is
[16207.36s -> 16217.17s]  it alive I keep thinking these things are alive that one is but I don't need
[16217.17s -> 16234.12s]  to even go near it you get out of the way time for progress save the
[16234.12s -> 16249.78s]  game through the door I'm ready that guy wasn't a zombie imagine that poor
[16249.78s -> 16264.76s]  guy excellent it's just triple check okay so should I make more Magnum ammo
[16264.76s -> 16276.65s]  because what is um what is high grade and large gunpowder no that's how do I
[16276.65s -> 16281.76s]  make the mag in the memo you can't so this is just gonna be a bunch of
[16281.76s -> 16290.96s]  shotgun shells then which is actually probably better two yellows or
[16290.96s -> 16298.56s]  should I just make six well what six shotgun shells I feel like I need some
[16298.56s -> 16308.91s]  shotgun ammo and this is done so it'll be three shotgun shells wouldn't it be
[16308.91s -> 16325.95s]  six so just wait for another one to make another yellow okay these I am
[16325.95s -> 16332.53s]  kind of running low on ammo though so the do I need to bring one of
[16332.53s -> 16336.83s]  these with me does it even matter what is this I'm done with this this
[16336.83s -> 16346.10s]  is just done I'm not gonna regret not taking one of these whatever all right

[17160.06s -> 17170.74s]  them no I'm good I'm good I'm good I just had it's fine I got plenty of
[17170.74s -> 17179.83s]  other ammo plus speaking of ammo there's some right here where the hell
[17180.27s -> 17191.43s]  this is magical handgun ammo okay let me take a look out of shotgun shells I
[17191.43s -> 17201.09s]  got some Magnum ammo my health is fine I made a little bridge for myself
[17201.09s -> 17223.67s]  and all right Ada you still alive did I grab the knife but there was no
[17223.67s -> 17239.33s]  knife but there's a safe now I'm in a little bit of trouble because no
[17239.33s -> 17255.23s]  shotgun ammo I have plenty heels I'm gonna have to conserve ammo here
[17255.23s -> 17267.04s]  somebody's get fit stormy to just get $50 stormy to thank you so much for 50
[17267.04s -> 17272.96s]  bucks 5,000 bits from stormy to streams been great so far lots of laughs
[17272.96s -> 17278.70s]  tonight question for you what would you do in a Resident Evil scenario you
[17278.70s -> 17283.30s]  gotta try you know I wouldn't use any I wouldn't use a gun because guns are
[17283.30s -> 17287.66s]  unreliable you need to have ammunition for a gun so instead of having like
[17287.66s -> 17295.04s]  ammo for a gun I would just get a baseball metal baseball bat I wouldn't
[17295.04s -> 17298.52s]  be dead we talking about a metal baseball bat and you just swing as
[17298.52s -> 17305.03s]  hard as you can for their heads it never runs out of ammo it will never
[17305.03s -> 17309.76s]  break and zombies are slow and stupid you just have to hit them as
[17309.76s -> 17314.92s]  hard as you can possibly swing double crow hop into the face they're not
[17314.92s -> 17322.13s]  gonna get up it's just not gonna happen not a knife no no no that's too small
[17322.13s -> 17330.34s]  or probably even a better weapon of choice would be a an or like a rowboat
[17330.34s -> 17336.73s]  or it's made it a solid wood it's got length and you can just or somebody
[17336.73s -> 17339.85s]  in the back of the fucking head that's probably the best melee weapon
[17339.85s -> 17348.08s]  you could probably have in a zombie apocalypse what about a spear no not
[17348.08s -> 17354.85s]  a spear spear that it's a point a rowing or it's a big flat spatula like
[17354.85s -> 17359.31s]  this big you don't have to aim very much you could really just just double
[17359.31s -> 17364.71s]  crow hop huge reach and crush skulls I would last and then I would go to a
[17364.71s -> 17367.07s]  grocery store I would just sit at the grocery store I would just take all the
[17367.07s -> 17368.95s]  Campbell's tomato soup and I would just that's what I would eat every
[17368.95s -> 17392.36s]  day I would live forever let's go what about a two by four two by four
[17392.36s -> 17404.22s]  is that's not big enough and it's not that strong either how would I
[17404.22s -> 17413.86s]  reach it on the shelves I haven't or either are you nice try to get worried
[17413.86s -> 17420.57s]  there for a second I can't get it out I don't know if I should just do it I
[17420.57s -> 17432.46s]  can't walk like this okay that's definitely in fact it's been there for
[17432.46s -> 17441.33s]  like an hour and a half I can do it myself just relax okay what is that
[17441.33s -> 17449.70s]  magical oil he's putting on so what do we do now get yourself out of here
[17449.70s -> 17457.38s]  well you still can I'm not just gonna leave you not like this you don't
[17457.38s -> 17464.04s]  understand the situation's worse than I thought you're not getting rid of me
[17464.04s -> 17471.80s]  that easy it was antiseptic that's my turn just get yourself in a work
[17471.80s -> 17484.22s]  keeping score grab my shoulder push it rookie just trying to help watch your
[17484.22s -> 17490.65s]  step but long story short we have to get to the nest anything that requires
[17490.65s -> 17495.77s]  resources is bad in a zombie apocalypse right beneath us and that let it slip
[17495.77s -> 17502.89s]  that's where the virus samples are you up for this I think I could fit in
[17502.89s -> 17509.98s]  my schedule come on we got work to do food is but food is necessary to
[17510.02s -> 17515.80s]  survive a shotgun shell is not necessary to survive if you don't you don't like
[17515.80s -> 17524.78s]  eat shotgun shells and by the way Campbell's tomato soup is a great weapon
[17524.78s -> 17529.70s]  nice where'd you get that you have a backpack with like 40 of them and you
[17529.70s -> 17533.46s]  can just take them out and just club people with them you can throw them
[17533.46s -> 17541.41s]  they're heavy as shit they weigh like they will take six and a half pounds
[17541.41s -> 17544.29s]  one can of Campbell's tomato soup it's got six and a half pounds of
[17544.29s -> 17553.96s]  tomato in there there's six and a half tomatoes inside of one can I need to
[17553.96s -> 17566.51s]  save the game let me carry you no that only make me feel worse I feel
[17566.51s -> 17569.67s]  pretty bad too come on Ada we both uh in dire
[17569.67s -> 17576.03s]  straights right now it's not just you how's the shoulder worse than it
[17576.03s -> 17595.06s]  looks what a pair both got one foot in the grave getting blinky here all
[17595.06s -> 17619.45s]  right her little tea card wrist watch will open the store right you would
[17619.45s -> 17623.69s]  think there would be something up there this may be a one-way ride so be
[17623.69s -> 17640.93s]  prepared are you prepared huh I just saved it so how are we doing on time
[17644.45s -> 17655.28s]  you know what I was thinking I can't wait for the FBI to raid Umbrella
[17655.28s -> 17659.84s]  headquarters and take those bastards to justice I agree but to be clear
[17659.84s -> 17665.20s]  you're not working in official capacity this is a federal case once we get the
[17665.20s -> 17679.74s]  g-virus I'm back on my own hey Leon trust me trust me honestly if I
[17679.74s -> 17685.09s]  didn't you'd probably be dead I thought I might need your help and I
[17685.09s -> 17688.73s]  was right if you can secure the g-virus I can make sure what happened
[17688.73s -> 17692.77s]  in Raccoon City never happens again can I make myself look fucking huge in
[17692.97s -> 17700.01s]  yourself it's a federal case I don't have the authority look at me my ability now
[17700.01s -> 17705.15s]  if I'm gonna finish this case you're the last hope I've got I'm not just
[17705.15s -> 17708.85s]  gonna leave you here what if you're attacked what if you need help that

[18003.56s -> 18008.29s]  and speaking of hoarding this does they use a yellow liquid substance
[18008.29s -> 18014.17s]  that has been building up inside of my body and I gotta I gotta get it out
[18014.17s -> 18018.66s]  I'm telling you scary games make me every like hour and so does my
[18018.66s -> 18031.47s]  terrible old person body I've peed three times in five hours I mean I've
[18031.47s -> 18034.83s]  been drinking I've been drinking like a water of an hour but and every
[18034.83s -> 18041.74s]  hour and a half maybe feed three times in five hours it's just it's the
[18041.74s -> 18046.10s]  it's this I'm getting this all the hydration is sapping out of my body
[18046.10s -> 18053.61s]  because I'm screaming that's two-third as much as you need well why am I peeing
[18053.61s -> 18060.49s]  so much anybody in here a doctor I'll be right back if there's a doc if
[18060.49s -> 18065.09s]  anybody in here is a doctor but why I have that I've had my kidneys checked
[18065.09s -> 18069.98s]  I've had blood work if I have my kidneys checked why am I peeing every
[18069.98s -> 18077.20s]  like fucking hour and a half what the hell so all the doctors that I
[18077.20s -> 18081.28s]  mean this is all this 3050 people watching right now I my viewers are
[18081.28s -> 18085.88s]  incredibly intelligent I think there's at least 1500 doctors here so among
[18085.88s -> 18089.48s]  the medical community maybe you can come to consensus yourselves as to why
[18089.48s -> 18093.00s]  because I know that you know it is there so I'll be right back
[18093.00s -> 18278.36s]  I got myself a Coke I need something to sip on way better than Pepsi way

[18300.18s -> 18304.40s]  blindfold taste tested me I'd probably say I would probably say Coke
[18304.40s -> 18313.16s]  was a little bit a little bit less acidic Pepsi's like acidic it has
[18313.20s -> 18317.08s]  you can taste it in your nose it's like a nasally acidic flavor where Coke is
[18317.08s -> 18323.58s]  like a back of the tongue sugary deep flavor back here Pepsi is up here Coke
[18323.58s -> 18333.17s]  is like back here like back here I was already in here
[18333.17s -> 18345.78s]  does it say he seems fatter what are you talking about he seems fatter I
[18345.78s -> 18356.42s]  think one of my eyes just crossed I definitely just one of my eyes just
[18356.42s -> 18373.50s]  crossed over the other like that it actually happened out of the time I was
[18373.50s -> 18400.53s]  gonna jump out of the boxes no liquor not quite
[18409.49s -> 18416.01s]  there's a lot of people here now I gotta get in there there's like super

[18594.11s -> 18608.34s]  gives you two large bullets speaking of bullets I'm going to need some
[18608.66s -> 18620.00s]  thank you I don't want to use the shotgun yet there's a new wristwatch
[18620.00s -> 18628.70s]  and regular regular flame regulator for the flames or a custom part of the
[18628.70s -> 18632.22s]  flamethrower restricts liquid fuel making it possible to fire for much
[18632.22s -> 18643.25s]  longer chemical flamethrower I didn't even use it once so I get to use it
[18643.25s -> 18654.96s]  for much longer good in there muff I don't think I don't have the
[18654.96s -> 18664.93s]  necessary item for this I don't although you do have a new watch here
[18664.93s -> 18670.95s]  electronic chip you're gonna combine that come in handy so where does it
[18670.95s -> 18682.48s]  let's see what I can do with it general staff so my security clearance
[18682.48s -> 18687.12s]  is general staff which I think I can go through this door and then
[18687.12s -> 18710.41s]  probably probably this door okay let's go someone's gonna this they
[18710.41s -> 18714.83s]  wouldn't just let you gather straight away here no way something's
[18714.83s -> 18729.78s]  gonna be here no good save it
[18733.98s -> 18748.65s]  still people here the hell is still here fuel for his max so I have two
[18748.65s -> 18754.46s]  large gunpowders now so I asked a question and then didn't look at chat
[18754.46s -> 18759.78s]  does it to combining two gunpowders big ones do anything interesting or
[18759.86s -> 18778.83s]  it's lots of ammo it's 50 pistol rounds Wow okay is that worth doing in this
[18778.83s -> 18785.69s]  stage of the game do you think it's worth having like a really good supply
[18785.69s -> 18799.20s]  of pistols it literally says it on the screen we'll see if I get
[18799.20s -> 18803.70s]  desperate I can do it but I still have plenty of ammo in this that I
[18803.70s -> 18815.42s]  haven't even used so anyway I'm gonna store it I have plenty of I got
[18815.42s -> 18829.98s]  a heel here don't need it just yet I still have that tool why didn't I get
[18829.98s -> 18839.51s]  this for PC this this is on PC this is PC fill up the fuel yeah that's a good
[18839.51s -> 18849.63s]  idea I'm playing with yeah I'm playing the controller and it's not so good
[18849.63s -> 18854.99s]  for aim but it's alright for I like moving around a third person with the
[18854.99s -> 18866.06s]  controller feels more organic to me well this is different main shaft
[18866.10s -> 18874.34s]  special forces recording target moving to West area must be going over to the
[18874.34s -> 18877.66s]  dream virus an antiviral agent this is ghost

[20136.82s -> 20160.71s]  sticks I'm let me let me console aim for a second here I had so many heels
[20160.71s -> 20172.62s]  this was my decision yes and I'm gonna sleep in my fucking terrible bed that
[20172.62s -> 20192.66s]  I've made I'm gonna shit in my bed I have to clean it up eventually do I
[20192.66s -> 20203.40s]  have another heel in here that's not okay so unfortunately I have to use one
[20203.40s -> 20209.77s]  of the super heels so I'm gonna do high grade high grade yellow and yellow is a
[20209.77s -> 20221.54s]  bunch of shotgun shells right no it's Magnum okay right but that's important
[20221.54s -> 20227.04s]  Magnum is like what I want now what I'm gonna equip the Magnum and I'm
[20227.04s -> 20230.84s]  gonna make sure I use console aiming to hit precise fucking shots with the
[20230.84s -> 20245.63s]  Magnum let's do it now I'm gonna do so gunpowder and large gunpowder
[20245.63s -> 20249.39s]  doesn't matter I think I want like some pistol ammo look at how much I have in
[20249.39s -> 20263.30s]  here I have too much I could do console aiming and precise it's just
[20263.30s -> 20275.14s]  oh it's alright it's fine I think I want some more shotgun so I'm gonna do
[20275.14s -> 20286.14s]  shotgun and then I'm gonna do six shotgun I think I want pistol as well
[20286.14s -> 20296.25s]  so too large gives me a bunch of handgun ammo which I'm just gonna do
[20296.25s -> 20302.29s]  it I don't think there's a reason to hoard this I really don't think there
[20302.29s -> 20315.58s]  is it what if we drop in frames oh we did oh well alright let's uh let's do
[20315.58s -> 20320.66s]  we're gonna double I'm gonna combine these two and make a shitload that's
[20320.66s -> 20326.04s]  actually very very good so what do I have now let's take some inventory I
[20326.04s -> 20344.24s]  need to get a better look at this so hold on don't get cocky at least
[20344.24s -> 20351.60s]  now I have ammo to use let's get some fuel 400 that's good
[20351.80s -> 20360.42s]  got 12 magnum ammo and seven in the chamber I need to take a couple of these
[20360.42s -> 20379.36s]  actually because I'm almost dead bring the signal modifier wooden boards so
[20379.36s -> 20385.80s]  that leaves me with this I think I'm gonna store these for now let's move
[20385.80s -> 20388.88s]  some shit around so we got that I don't have any more ammo for the
[20388.88s -> 20395.53s]  shotgun there's eight bullets in there for the modifying signal okay pretty
[20395.53s -> 20408.51s]  good I need to heal but not yet not yet take the bring the wooden boards to
[20408.51s -> 20420.04s]  fix the indoor windows so I have another thing to punch in here so there's the
[20420.04s -> 20425.98s]  sprinkler there's the control terminal I do I have to go to the where that
[20425.98s -> 20434.35s]  thing saying muff with Murph what where was it Murph muff I don't think
[20434.35s -> 20443.38s]  it was it down here I think was somewhere else there's not one in
[20443.38s -> 20463.01s]  here requires senior staff I got to go to the the nap room
[20481.53s -> 20520.54s]  it's not moving so much all right let's go I don't even heal yet so that
[20520.54s -> 20526.13s]  brings us to here what was the was on the trophy what was it it was what the
[20526.13s -> 20544.14s]  heck was it I don't remember it was I don't have the trophy with me burn
[20544.14s -> 20589.78s]  plants are you burnt are they burnt that one is come on burn got it okay

[20603.29s -> 20609.49s]  minecraft password here it was somebody remembers I it's okay go by numbers so
[20609.49s -> 20612.77s]  imagine it like one two three is up top four five six in the middle seven eight
[20612.77s -> 20631.71s]  nine involved it was wrong I don't want to go get the trophy Lego paws boots
[20631.71s -> 20642.87s]  Lego Lego no I did that one already is that it all right I did this one
[20642.87s -> 20657.59s]  I already did that one what was in the bottom of the trophy I'm gonna
[20657.59s -> 20690.89s]  have to go get the trophy okay so people were writing random numbers
[20690.89s -> 20701.43s]  let's see what it actually is so it's boots which way spinning around just
[20701.43s -> 20715.31s]  take the damn thing with me I'll throw it in the trash when I'm done he
[20715.31s -> 20743.33s]  he hates us I that one that's the correct one drug testing lab is now

[20758.53s -> 20767.42s]  which I need do any I need like a solution or something right so
[20767.42s -> 20770.34s]  through here I didn't burn these guys so unfortunately I probably have
[20770.34s -> 20776.63s]  to fight them again I burnt some of them didn't I I just think we remember
[20776.63s -> 20788.56s]  burning at least a couple of these guys this drug lab all right time to
[20788.56s -> 20807.59s]  make a potion so we're gonna put this in and I gotta do the double dare family
[20807.59s -> 20864.54s]  challenge thing where you gotta get the milk over the line you gotta get a
[20864.54s -> 20884.19s]  little bit and then I gotta get a little bit which one has a little bit
[20884.19s -> 20893.76s]  only I had it I think I had it right actually the first time because one of
[20893.76s -> 20900.39s]  them pissed out I got okay I gotta fill fill this up all the way and then what
[20900.39s -> 20915.62s]  happens if I do this okay there's a little bit left in here so I need
[20915.62s -> 20931.82s]  hold on so I need a full one of that and this little one that's not
[20931.82s -> 20938.50s]  enough it needs to be those two so the one the middle one on the right
[20938.50s -> 20950.26s]  one are I'm ready to go but this one has to be drained that's is that
[20950.26s -> 20974.42s]  gonna do it no it's too much okay that should be it stop messing with the big
[20974.42s -> 20985.94s]  gulp machine the freezy machine dude I'm doing I'm doing the cray I'm doing
[20985.94s -> 20995.26s]  like fucking coke Pepsi Sprite 7-up I'm doing all of them fuck it um it's

[21005.79s -> 21015.14s]  put that thing I just made into the machine which will spit out the
[21015.14s -> 21017.78s]  poison and I'll get the wristband that we can get on and I'll get on with it
[21017.78s -> 21025.06s]  right cartridge for dispersing various solutions with the greenhouse it's full
[21025.06s -> 21040.09s]  of solution taking precautions here I still have the signal modifier no it's
[21040.09s -> 21079.66s]  one of these listen to Cheeto thank you oh it's muff okay I get it muff I
[21079.66s -> 21103.32s]  gotta stand in front of them and do them I get it all right I have the
[21103.32s -> 21108.93s]  solution I'm gonna go back out here into the greenhouse room sprinkle
[21108.93s -> 21114.93s]  that shit where it needs to be sprinkled call it a day from there well
[21114.93s -> 21123.55s]  not it's not call it a stream but call it a day in the lab because this is
[21123.55s -> 21129.70s]  gonna destroy everything right this is the solution and this is this is this
[21129.70s -> 21135.49s]  correct hope so I'm gonna save it first just in case I didn't do it
[21135.49s -> 21158.92s]  right all right I gotta chill it oh yeah that's right I gotta I gotta cool
[21158.92s -> 21171.24s]  it down first so now the question is where was all that shit I cool it
[21171.68s -> 21187.86s]  all right here's a circuit breaker down here so from here I'm gonna go this way
[21187.86s -> 21195.62s]  and I want to find one of those like muff circuit breakers this one in this
[21195.62s -> 21206.78s]  area right here I got live I don't think so this one doesn't work it's
[21206.78s -> 21217.18s]  not turned on now there was a couple of enemies still down here I think both
[21217.18s -> 21221.78s]  the Lickers are probably still alive because they come back to life so I
[21221.78s -> 21240.10s]  gotta be careful but I want to find Murph so straight through here there's
[21240.10s -> 21252.86s]  a circuit breaker at the very end of the hall here all right no alive
[21252.86s -> 21273.07s]  Lickers please they're both dead I think I'm safe all right Murph son of a
[21273.07s -> 21290.42s]  bitch so Murph examine let's do it on Murph Murph

[22290.96s -> 22299.58s]  and we're going to get secret items no I'm definitely not getting
[22299.58s -> 22308.97s]  debated because it's it is listed right there it is pretty close it's
[22308.97s -> 22318.70s]  right here I'll just save it right here anyway just in case mr. man comes to get
[22318.70s -> 22330.17s]  me so it's just left and then I'd leave with it there was enemies in here
[22330.17s -> 22347.80s]  wouldn't there no not all the way down here that was the I was a funny
[22347.80s -> 22379.35s]  zombie that was kind of a funny zombie muff what do I get nice hit
[22379.35s -> 22401.89s]  pouch I think that's the final upgrade son of a bitch was this Wayne Lee's
[22401.89s -> 22406.75s]  notes dear God blood everywhere what the hell's happening they're dead all
[22406.75s -> 22411.75s]  dead it was those men in black USS headquarters special forces but why
[22411.75s -> 22415.65s]  isn't their job to protect us white brains in a sea of red this can't be
[22415.65s -> 22420.53s]  happening dear God why didn't everybody say I was a genius a genius
[22420.53s -> 22424.33s]  like me can't die in a place like this I always got results they're
[22424.33s -> 22430.21s]  screwing me well maybe well maybe I'll screw them I win the Nobel Prize
[22430.41s -> 22441.13s]  I'm a hero a genius of God I will not die unfortunately you did and that's
[22441.13s -> 22446.21s]  what I came back all the way back here for was an upgrade to my pouch got the
[22446.21s -> 22465.02s]  pouch upgrade okay I it's time to go why do people always write in their
[22465.02s -> 22476.06s]  diary when they're about to die because you want to you want to leave
[22476.06s -> 22481.55s]  you the last thing right you want to leave at least I got to tell somebody
[22481.55s -> 22485.95s]  my story right before right the apocalypse you can hear like the

[22489.07s -> 22498.22s]  something to say whoever finds this you know so I'm gonna hold on to this
[22498.22s -> 22502.34s]  just because people probably get angry if I throw it in the trash let's go
[22502.34s -> 22519.05s]  West Hall what would I write in my diary something ridiculous something
[22519.05s -> 22524.38s]  really really cryptic and weird just okay you guys know you guys know
[22524.38s -> 22529.61s]  mr. Satan from Dragon Ball Z I would just pretend I was like a superhero
[22529.61s -> 22534.42s]  or something like I fucking saved the day and shit I'd write like a whole
[22534.42s -> 22551.65s]  story about it here we go video cassette and grenade one of the
[22551.65s -> 22559.94s]  videotape to go play oh good is it player right here what perfect timing
[22559.94s -> 22587.50s]  for a videotape player good thing I brought it us us and there's the
[22587.50s -> 22600.24s]  light good no save point but there is a box for some reason let's put that tape
[22600.24s -> 22603.80s]  in and see that's it modulator is done I can't really get rid of it but
[22603.80s -> 22617.98s]  we'll watch the tape quiet movie
[22617.98s -> 22631.90s]  you'll come along with us quietly you think I didn't know you were
[22631.90s -> 22638.82s]  coming this is my life's work I'm not handing over anything we have our
[22638.82s -> 22643.50s]  orders dr. Birkin I'll ask you one more time
[22643.50s -> 22654.98s]  what the fuck are you trying to be there
[22654.98s -> 22658.98s]  what the fuck were you thinking our orders were to bring him in alive
[22658.98s -> 22668.50s]  yeah come on hunk get with the program we're in we had a snafu target
[22668.50s -> 22678.02s]  resisted we had to take him on that's correct sir so they're gonna do
[22678.02s -> 22682.88s]  a hunk campaign I hope they do they've done it but with every other
[22682.88s -> 22689.14s]  game they've ever made besides like resident seven right resident six it's

[22971.63s -> 22975.27s]  made a 50 centimeter incision from the chest of the abdomen and began our
[22975.27s -> 22982.72s]  observations subject's consciousness level was kept between 15 lucid in GCS
[22982.72s -> 22986.60s]  10 however the subject consciousness level deteriorated the further
[22986.60s -> 22991.40s]  observation was deemed unnecessary the subject was then disposed of the
[22991.40s -> 22997.04s]  G virus was administered to subject 501 they mutated into G form and was
[22997.04s -> 23002.20s]  introduced to a group of 30 test subjects after two hours 36 minutes it
[23002.20s -> 23005.72s]  was observed that all but one of the test subjects have been implanted
[23005.72s -> 23011.03s]  with the embryo all subjects were disposed of one subject broke down
[23011.03s -> 23017.55s]  during experimentation and took their own life G viruses 628 who had shown
[23017.55s -> 23022.51s]  slight resistance to the t-virus the virus was then introduced to subject
[23022.51s -> 23027.87s]  639 with whom 628 had a close relationship 628 showed some signs of
[23027.87s -> 23031.79s]  resistance but had it been implanted with an embryo up to 24 minutes t-virus
[23031.79s -> 23035.99s]  resistance does nothing to stop the mental deterioration caused by the G
[23035.99s -> 23051.22s]  virus a lot of numbers I'm tired that was easy all right it was back to

[24977.04s -> 24999.31s]  ending that was all right not even like a
[24999.31s -> 25007.58s]  ride a motorcycle into the mist all right no that's all right here's a go
[25007.58s -> 25015.04s]  here's my thoughts it's great that was that was great
[25015.04s -> 25019.20s]  that like two hour hour and a half period where mr x
[25019.20s -> 25028.37s]  the tyrant is just won't leave you alone as some of the most intense
[25028.37s -> 25031.65s]  terrifying experiences i've ever played in a video game it was fucking
[25031.65s -> 25039.02s]  unbelievable so there's all this is a clear
[25039.02s -> 25043.25s]  campaign too which takes you through the events of the story from a
[25043.25s -> 25049.33s]  completely different tv screen and you can see all the other stuff
[25049.33s -> 25051.33s]  there's a lot of other things that you places you go
[25051.33s -> 25058.45s]  with claire uh but the purposes of tonight's stream
[25058.45s -> 25062.29s]  and obviously yesterday's stream leon that was what seven
[25062.29s -> 25066.45s]  eight nine ten about like nine hours for the campaign
[25066.45s -> 25069.89s]  ten hours for the campaign total somewhere between like eight to twelve
[25069.89s -> 25076.02s]  hours for general playthrough i guess but uh i
[25076.02s -> 25080.32s]  don't know if i would stream claire i don't know is there enough
[25080.32s -> 25086.58s]  content to justify doing it all over again from another side
[25086.58s -> 25093.95s]  that there is there there actually is okay
[25093.95s -> 25106.51s]  it's the same levels but it's it's different
[25106.51s -> 25111.79s]  no i mean yeah the i would i would assume that
[25111.79s -> 25117.07s]  if they did the campaigns this way i mean in the first original game it
[25117.07s -> 25119.87s]  was kind of like that too right he played from two different
[25119.87s -> 25129.68s]  perspectives but that was great uh streaming wise we'll we'll see if
[25129.68s -> 25133.81s]  this is something that we'll always kind of have it in the back pocket
[25133.81s -> 25136.91s]  because i don't think i would we just we've done resident evil 2 for the
[25136.91s -> 25139.97s]  last two days in a row i don't think i would
[25139.97s -> 25145.78s]  want to do this like the like the next stream we do right
[25145.78s -> 25149.38s]  maybe i don't know it depends on how i feel uh
[25149.38s -> 25157.25s]  not tomorrow uh we'll be streaming next on what's today's date let me see
[25157.25s -> 25160.69s]  let me see let me see today is the 29th so the next
[25160.69s -> 25166.85s]  stream will be on uh thursday so nothing tomorrow
[25166.85s -> 25171.09s]  except we'll get back on thursday maybe i'll just do claire
[25171.09s -> 25175.98s]  or maybe i'll try to do one some of the bonus stuff if not then there's a
[25175.98s -> 25178.88s]  couple other things that are on the table
[25178.88s -> 25183.14s]  still but that was a fantastic game that was great even just seeing
[25183.14s -> 25189.58s]  you know maybe not even 50 of it that was very very good
[25189.58s -> 25193.55s]  it was worth the purchase for sure are we going to get a post credits

[25491.82s -> 25496.30s]  yeah pacific time is really weird because when it's the daytime for me

[25570.03s -> 25574.19s]  stay still when shooting in this game the uh the recticle
[25574.19s -> 25578.18s]  to tighten for a chance of getting a crit headshot
[25578.18s -> 25581.89s]  yeah i figured i i did figure out somewhere
[25581.89s -> 25585.17s]  about 78 percent of the way through the game that there's like a
[25585.17s -> 25589.39s]  counter-strike aiming system you just got to stand still i did
[25589.39s -> 25593.12s]  pretty good no i only missed a little bit
[25593.12s -> 25596.24s]  hey beef one dough thanks for the one dollar thank you
[25596.24s -> 25599.81s]  ydna thank you for the 10 dollars ydna
[25599.81s -> 25602.45s]  hey germa addressing the pizza hut versus domino's chat a few streams
[25602.45s -> 25606.29s]  ago i just want to say that i've worked at pizza hut for three years
[25606.29s -> 25610.37s]  and that all the dough comes in frozen and nothing is made fresh
[25610.37s -> 25615.01s]  if you have the five dollar menu where you're at it's a big fucking steal
[25615.01s -> 25622.37s]  yeah but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean i don't like the pizza
[25622.37s -> 25625.33s]  it just because it's frozen doesn't mean i don't i can't you know what i
[25625.33s -> 25631.04s]  mean it still tastes good stuffed crust pizza but nobody goes
[25631.04s -> 25633.52s]  to pizza hut and thinking a stuffed crust pizza
[25633.52s -> 25639.95s]  is some organically made product i know it comes off of a truck frozen
[25639.95s -> 25647.71s]  you can't put cheese in a crust like that if it has to be manufactured
[25647.71s -> 25652.14s]  it's gross don't eat it i can't i have to
[25652.14s -> 25657.65s]  i i know it's probably bad he's so upset
[25657.65s -> 25661.33s]  i'm not upset it's just i love stuffed crust pizza and i have i've only got
[25661.33s -> 25663.65s]  to eat it like once every couple of years
[25663.65s -> 25672.69s]  but i love it i wouldn't say i don't think pizza hut's the best pizza ever
[25672.69s -> 25678.13s]  i would put it pretty far down on the chain of restaurants right
[25678.13s -> 25681.95s]  but it doesn't mean i don't like it hey we phone thank you for the one dollar
[25681.95s -> 25684.67s]  sorry for some things i say in chat i feel like i can make comments that i
[25684.67s -> 25687.47s]  think are appropriate but looking back they could possibly
[25687.47s -> 25691.31s]  sound mean-spirited or even just completely off topic and i just vent
[25691.31s -> 25695.55s]  sometimes i forget people especially you can read and it's not the place
[25695.55s -> 25698.59s]  for that kind of stuff i just get a little wild and don't
[25698.59s -> 25704.40s]  always think before i say things germapleudo that's okay see here here's
[25704.40s -> 25708.69s]  the thing if you do something that you maybe
[25708.77s -> 25713.33s]  shouldn't have done or you think back you have the wherewithal to
[25713.33s -> 25716.61s]  think back and understand that what you're doing
[25716.61s -> 25720.77s]  might not be right or it might not be appropriate right
[25720.77s -> 25724.37s]  so give yourself the credit that at least you're looking back
[25724.37s -> 25727.81s]  and are trying to improve on maybe some things that you might say
[25727.81s -> 25732.45s]  i'm not saying that i don't 99 of everything that's in this chat i know
[25732.45s -> 25739.12s]  is just for fun and a joke trust me i know it germa you keep
[25739.12s -> 25743.86s]  bumping the mic fuck i'm sorry but no i i know that people are just fucking
[25743.86s -> 25747.66s]  around so don't worry about that just know that
[25747.66s -> 25751.92s]  it's good that you have like i said the wherewithal to step back

[26045.02s -> 26048.78s]  considered by most fans of the game franchise

[26053.14s -> 26061.25s]  understanding i always thought the three was three
[26061.25s -> 26069.97s]  and six i thought with just nobody really liked them it's six
[26069.97s -> 26077.92s]  it's just six yeah i didn't like six either
[26077.92s -> 26083.14s]  six was just it didn't even feel like a resident evil game it felt like a
[26083.14s -> 26088.27s]  it was kind of just shoot at other military guys right

[26375.68s -> 26378.62s]  two dollars hey germa guess what's happening tomorrow
[26378.62s -> 26381.58s]  we shop and anything online related for the we will get shut down
[26381.58s -> 26385.02s]  forever will you pay your respects to the we
[26385.02s -> 26388.46s]  ps the we shop music will still be playable but you can't go to the store
[26388.46s -> 26391.20s]  itself and anything the we you features
[26391.20s -> 26395.20s]  online for the we is shut down too so basically it's the original xbox
[26395.20s -> 26410.24s]  live shutdown for the we i mean whatever
[26410.24s -> 26425.50s]  it's like what was on the we shop it's like
[26425.50s -> 26440.03s]  wow mario tennis you can but you can just get mario tennis
[26440.03s -> 26446.35s]  unstepping fuck you germa i'm just listen let me tell you something
[26446.35s -> 26452.45s]  i think is i think it's i don't know why companies decide to open up these
[26452.45s -> 26456.66s]  stores in the first place if they know that they're just going
[26456.66s -> 26462.11s]  to close them i like i don't i think that's dumb you know
[26462.11s -> 26468.78s]  eventually every digital store is probably going to turn off
[26468.78s -> 26477.15s]  but but for me personally i i did there's nothing on like the
[26477.15s -> 26482.86s]  we shop that i am like oh fuck i'm not gonna be able to
[26482.86s -> 26486.72s]  i can't do that anymore i kind of i got my fun out of the we
[26486.72s -> 26491.94s]  now wait this is important though hold on our if you bought a game
[26491.94s -> 26496.11s]  on the we shop is it still downloadable
[26496.11s -> 26507.34s]  just not purchasable anymore like let's say i i bought like
[26507.34s -> 26511.73s]  10 games on the we shop is it just is it actually
[26511.73s -> 26514.69s]  like they're not they're closing it down or all the servers are turning up
[26514.69s -> 26522.43s]  and you can't even download it you can only play the things you
[26522.43s -> 26525.31s]  download it you can't you can't even know the
[26525.31s -> 26528.83s]  servers are all shutting down all right like that's that's that fucking
[26528.83s -> 26531.87s]  sucks i didn't know i was unaware of the
[26531.87s -> 26535.90s]  details i thought they were just closing the
[26535.90s -> 26542.62s]  store not turning off all the servers i thought like i thought what
[26542.62s -> 26546.94s]  people have been saying is like this the store was closing i apologize for
[26546.94s -> 26557.89s]  that i'm sorry about that um yeah that's like a terrible
[26557.89s -> 26561.90s]  scary reality of everything being digital
[26561.90s -> 26566.06s]  you know 10 20 30 years from now if it's not profitable for a company to
[26566.06s -> 26569.50s]  keep what you've purchased online and they
[26569.50s -> 26572.46s]  have the terms of service just to pull the plug on it
[26572.46s -> 26575.26s]  then you know all the things you ever purchased are impossible to ever
[26575.26s -> 26578.72s]  receive ever again that's kind of the digital world
[26578.72s -> 26586.91s]  that's the scary weird reality we live in if steam were to turn
[26586.91s -> 26593.71s]  its servers off tomorrow i would lose out on
[26593.71s -> 26599.33s]  hundreds of games if i couldn't play them but the thing
[26599.33s -> 26603.26s]  with steam is you you just it's not those games would still
[26603.26s -> 26605.74s]  function but you just wouldn't be able to download them anymore
[26605.74s -> 26610.02s]  but still you would lose out on so your entire library thousands of
[26610.02s -> 26618.70s]  dollars gone potentially you think that uh
[26618.78s -> 26622.30s]  services like this would have some like emergency
[26622.30s -> 26625.50s]  sort of backup of everything and just have it available
[26625.50s -> 26629.71s]  even if there's not very many servers because like let's put it this way if
[26629.71s -> 26633.95s]  if you were going to go download like mario tennis for the we shop
[26633.95s -> 26637.15s]  and it was going to take you a little while because oh shit
[26637.15s -> 26641.74s]  oh that's right there's like 10 servers that are online
[26641.74s -> 26645.10s]  not like 500 it's going to take me a few days
[26645.10s -> 26647.98s]  you probably still wouldn't i mean it would be annoying but at least you
[26647.98s -> 26659.70s]  could still do it that's why you back them up keep copies on archives and
[26659.70s -> 26665.33s]  that's not a concern yeah unless you're using a service
[26665.33s -> 26672.42s]  that stores everything but that's unfortunate i didn't i
[26672.42s -> 26675.62s]  wasn't aware that it was not just a store that it was literally
[26675.62s -> 26680.67s]  anything everything related to we online the whole the whole shop the whole
[26680.67s -> 26683.95s]  everything that sucks but there's nothing i would really want to play i
[26683.95s -> 26685.95s]  played pretty much everything i wanted to
[26685.95s -> 26694.06s]  there'll be an emulator there's an emulator for the games anyways
[26694.06s -> 26698.96s]  yeah that's where that's why emulation is important
[26698.96s -> 26707.06s]  it is because there's backups of these pieces of media
[26707.06s -> 26711.22s]  that you would just get kind of lost forever wouldn't it decades decade i'm
[26711.22s -> 26718.03s]  talking like 100 years from now we need that library of video game
[26718.03s -> 26730.43s]  congress is the music muted oh no i just turned it down a little
[26730.43s -> 26733.55s]  but thank you peaceful hailey for the one dollar hi jeremy and chat

[27439.87s -> 27442.19s]  like four hours it's just it's kind of all over the place to a point
[27442.19s -> 27444.35s]  when i'm not sure i'd want to do it
[27444.35s -> 27448.83s]  i don't i can't go in blind and oh wow i don't know what's gonna
[27448.83s -> 27451.79s]  happen because i know a bunch of the scares already i know a
[27451.79s -> 27454.59s]  bunch of the stuff already so i don't know if it would be a

[27545.98s -> 27550.42s]  showered with such incredible comments and such praise

[27554.42s -> 27557.28s]  times i wish there was something more i could say or do
[27557.28s -> 27560.48s]  but all i'm gonna do is just continue to be here and hang out and
[27560.48s -> 27566.18s]  stream and try to do my best and that's not gonna change i don't

[27576.10s -> 27578.50s]  have nick thank you nick for the one dollar you're probably the person i
[27578.50s -> 27584.80s]  look up to the most that's still that's i can't i don't
[27584.80s -> 27588.02s]  even know how to respond to that like that's
[27588.02s -> 27595.42s]  i'm so happy that you can take anything from this stream it's such a
[27595.42s -> 27600.14s]  nice thing to say to somebody it's such an interesting thing to hear
[27600.14s -> 27603.82s]  i don't know what i don't know what i can do i don't know what i
[27603.82s -> 27607.95s]  how i act or how i you know it's that's kind of
[27608.03s -> 27611.76s]  and i essentially am at that place for you
[27611.76s -> 27616.27s]  where i'm sort of on like a pedestal and i'm not sure i want to be
[27616.27s -> 27621.15s]  i'd rather i don't know it's a weird feeling
[27621.15s -> 27625.23s]  maybe the pedestal is not the right word but
[27625.23s -> 27628.35s]  i just i just want us all collectively
[27628.35s -> 27632.27s]  as a community and as a group to go as fast as we can
[27632.27s -> 27636.19s]  on the highway you know what i mean just like to go very fast
[27636.19s -> 27642.40s]  and then we slow down a little and i just i want us all collectively to
[27642.40s -> 27645.36s]  have a great time and i just hope that you can get
[27645.36s -> 27649.42s]  something out of the stream and i hope that
[27649.42s -> 27653.74s]  i i guess it's just and maybe i'm like a self-deprecating a little here
[27653.74s -> 27660.22s]  but i think i have to because it keeps me honest
[27660.22s -> 27666.06s]  it keeps me uh my head on straight and you know the nature of the
[27666.06s -> 27669.26s]  business here the nature of the online entertainment kind of world i
[27669.26s -> 27676.94s]  want to stay i want to keep my head on but

[27687.54s -> 27693.25s]  perspective though right uh i there's there's a very specific
[27693.25s -> 27698.56s]  thing that i want to do here and when people tell me that you
[27698.56s -> 27703.04s]  know they look up to me so much i i it's almost like i want to
[27703.04s -> 27714.29s]  do more and i do appreciate it that somebody would say something like that

[28032.94s -> 28035.98s]  and each of the characters looks like they're on strings

[28223.90s -> 28227.18s]  is the new t-shirt that's coming out it was going to be either today or
[28227.18s -> 28229.90s]  tomorrow but since i'm not streaming tomorrow
[28229.90s -> 28233.18s]  i'm just going to hold off on it and i'm going to launch it's going to
[28233.18s -> 28237.50s]  be a storefront on teespring and they will both be
[28237.50s -> 28242.94s]  permanently available at least for i mean we'll see how long that the
[28242.94s -> 28245.42s]  store can last but they're not going to be taken down
[28245.42s -> 28251.17s]  for a long time thursday at the beginning of the stream
[28251.17s -> 28257.63s]  i will link to the storefront and there they will be the shirts are
[28257.63s -> 28260.88s]  planning i'm planning on the shirts being 20 bucks
[28260.88s -> 28264.32s]  i actually was on the teespring website and they changed some of their
[28264.32s -> 28267.12s]  materials they changed the way that they made that you can design shirts
[28267.12s -> 28269.12s]  now they got rid of some of those shirts
[28269.12s -> 28272.66s]  from before but i still think that i can do 20
[28272.66s -> 28278.80s]  dollars with like the premium t-shirt because last time i did the premium
[28278.80s -> 28282.48s]  t-shirt and i was 20 was still fine for like
[28282.48s -> 28286.34s]  all the overhead so i they changed some things i still
[28286.34s -> 28290.37s]  think it's going to be possible so it should be one of those nice
[28290.37s -> 28298.43s]  premium shirts for 20 bucks thursday and then yes i will tweet it
[28298.43s -> 28301.89s]  i'm going to tweet it out there'll be a command in the chat for it

[28318.61s -> 28322.13s]  no they have what the teespring changed the shit
