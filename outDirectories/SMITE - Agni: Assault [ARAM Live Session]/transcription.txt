[0.31s -> 15.21s]  Zeus, Odin, Agni. Oh, it's gonna be hard. I'm so bad with Agni. I am terrible with Agni.
[15.21s -> 20.87s]  All right, boo. How do you play Agni? Tell me in like five steps or less. Oh shit, okay.
[20.87s -> 25.39s]  You stun by putting your one down and then putting any of your fire abilities on top of it.
[25.39s -> 32.06s]  And then your two is a short-range damage ability. Your three is a dash. Your four is your meter.
[32.54s -> 34.06s]  Oh dear.
[34.06s -> 36.30s]  All random, all middle.
[36.50s -> 41.32s]  Star's gonna be spying on us. What is with this item menu? How do I just find items?
[42.74s -> 47.71s]  Alright, I'm just gonna get boots, I think. I don't know. I've never played Agni, ever.
[50.38s -> 55.23s]  Anybody but Agni. I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say, get anyone out of y'all guys, but.
[56.03s -> 58.27s]  Remember. Yeah, I've seen you play Hevo before.
[60.86s -> 62.02s]  Consumable.
[62.02s -> 67.65s]  Well, I actually spec'd the first one, right? Okay. Alright, so what should I get? My two first, two late. I already did it.
[68.33s -> 70.26s]  Yeah.
[70.26s -> 73.66s]  Look at this. Look at this map. This map is insane. Yeah, it's cool.
[73.66s -> 79.34s]  I wonder how much gold you get a second. So you cannot recall. I have no idea what I'm buying. I'm just gonna buy stuff.
[81.92s -> 84.40s]  Oh, but you got Ares. It's not too terrible.
[84.92s -> 89.68s]  Yeah, he's okay. I would have preferred, uh, I would have had Agni any day.
[89.68s -> 94.56s]  I know. Can we like change characters? Like I would be more comfortable with him. Oh god, the confusion sets in.
[95.36s -> 99.63s]  Anybody but Agni. You know what? I'm just going in. You want to go in?
[100.43s -> 107.68s]  I'm scared. I can't find this book. I'm following this build guide and I can't find this book. Who's Poseidon?
[107.68s -> 111.08s]  No, Gavin's Poseidon. No, I wish I had. God. Gavin, you better carry.
[112.38s -> 118.70s]  Magical power, maybe. So wait, Gavin. Alright, here we go. There we go. I found. Okay. Do we get lanes? Yeah, we get lanes. Okay.
[118.70s -> 122.32s]  I have to read up on my build. I've never played Hevo before.
[124.06s -> 131.20s]  Basically, yeah. Yeah, really really squishy. That's what I know. Star has Agni too. Level up to 3 and you won.
[131.84s -> 135.92s]  Yeah, okay. Your 3 is the safest move. Yeah, I expect that first.
[137.04s -> 144.10s]  Alright, let me get a nice. Oh my god. Oh god. Star, are you still on the call? Star's taking a beating.
[144.10s -> 149.78s]  Oh, did Star drop out of the call to like not hear our strats? Oh, that monkey. I think he's here. He's just like spying on us.
[151.94s -> 155.94s]  Okay, everybody move in now. Uh oh. No, not moving. What do you mean moving now?
[156.74s -> 158.74s]  I was trying to trick Star.
[159.94s -> 163.54s]  So do you have to die? Like you have to die, right? Yeah.
[164.34s -> 166.82s]  God, I don't. How the hell do you play Agni?
[167.86s -> 172.18s]  That monkey, bro. Yeah, that monkey is strong. Save your monkey for when the minions are dead.
[172.18s -> 174.18s]  Because then you can get. That's what I've been doing, yeah.
[175.54s -> 182.34s]  Look at these minions. These minions are crazy looking. They're like demons. Look at this guy. Yeah, they're demons. They're god damn demons.
[183.30s -> 188.21s]  Here comes an Agni, rogue Agni, dashing through. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[189.01s -> 194.05s]  Oh, get punished him. Punish him. Punish him. Yeah, Gavin. Yeah, high res Gavin. Go on, Gavin.
[194.69s -> 198.08s]  Clean it up. Ow.
[198.08s -> 203.98s]  So we gotta get both towers and then, okay. Oh my god, they go to Zeus.
[204.78s -> 208.38s]  This is gonna take a while, I feel like. This is gonna be like an hour long game.
[212.48s -> 214.48s]  Dancing around so much. Here comes Cage.
[215.34s -> 216.30s]  No.
[216.30s -> 219.10s]  Oh god, that was horrible. Get that, son of a bitch.
[221.26s -> 224.00s]  Get that Ramana.
[224.00s -> 226.00s]  Jesus. Oh, yeah. Oh.
[226.94s -> 229.26s]  I got a kill.
[229.26s -> 231.86s]  Yay.
[231.86s -> 233.86s]  I got someone. There you go. There you go.
[235.36s -> 239.36s]  Get him. Get him. Good job, boo. Looking good. Looking good. Looking good.
[243.36s -> 245.60s]  Oh god. Oh, that Zeus is just doing so much damage.
[246.80s -> 250.08s]  It hurts.
[250.08s -> 252.24s]  All right, so get. We gotta get two towers.
[253.58s -> 258.14s]  Holy. Oh my god. We gotta get high enough level where they're dead. Yeah. For a long time.
[260.66s -> 264.48s]  Holy sheep shit. This is gonna be tough.
[266.82s -> 270.58s]  We got this. I need more mana. Right. Is it just Zeus? Is it just Zeus?
[272.91s -> 275.79s]  Boo's running. He's gonna try to suicide, but Zeus is chasing him.
[278.34s -> 281.30s]  Get that. Get that, son of a. Get him. Boo, turn around.
[281.86s -> 284.42s]  Boo, turn around. Hit him once. Oh, I got him. I got him. I got him.
[288.85s -> 290.85s]  Boo's just like running into the tower.
[291.49s -> 293.49s]  I was wondering what you were doing.
[294.93s -> 297.65s]  I mean, if you feed the kill to the tower, then they don't get any XP or gold for it.
[299.38s -> 301.38s]  Are you sure? But he wasn't hitting me. I'm too tanky.
[302.26s -> 305.01s]  It's like four towers.
[305.01s -> 307.97s]  We should all build stone of Gaia so we just have permanent health regen.
[311.57s -> 314.85s]  Oh, I'll get bracer replenishment. There we go. That'll be good. That's perfect for me.
[315.65s -> 319.47s]  You should probably buy. Oh, going in on the Agni. Going in on the Agni.
[320.51s -> 322.14s]  Nice.
[322.14s -> 323.82s]  No, I'm in the cage.
[323.82s -> 327.26s]  He'll die fast. What? Can't believe I got him. Can we get him? Nice.
[328.22s -> 331.02s]  He jumped out. Oh, that was pretty good. Oh, I'm going down. See you later.
[332.74s -> 334.50s]  Oh boy, whole team.
[334.50s -> 340.85s]  This is gonna get really interesting really quickly here. We gotta go magical. Where is this the hootie?
[341.33s -> 343.33s]  There you are. We got magic.
[344.38s -> 348.78s]  Yeah, that's that Zeus is doing a lot of damage. I'm following this one guy that may just be crap, but
[349.58s -> 351.78s]  it's better than nothing.
[351.78s -> 353.78s]  Uh-oh, they're on the tower.
[353.86s -> 361.34s]  I'll make it happen, boo. Make it happen. I'm on the move. Make it happen. Back to the action, baby.
[364.51s -> 367.55s]  Uh-oh, boo. Be careful. Get that kill on him.
[368.27s -> 370.11s]  Yes.
[370.11s -> 372.11s]  Good job, boo. All right, we're up. We're up. You're going big.
[373.87s -> 376.11s]  Oh, we got it. We got it. That Harry's bro. Damn.
[376.83s -> 381.86s]  Get a move on. I don't want to. All right, it's Kelly.
[383.12s -> 385.52s]  All right, we oh boy. There it goes.
[386.32s -> 390.43s]  That was my bad.
[390.43s -> 391.79s]  Get out of here.
[391.79s -> 393.55s]  Uh-oh, big baby.
[393.63s -> 396.35s]  How did I not? Oh, she ages. I'm so bad.
[397.49s -> 399.49s]  Oh, no. Oh, I'm dead.
[401.10s -> 403.10s]  It hurts. Get that Agni. Just hit him.
[404.19s -> 406.19s]  Oh, come on. Nice job.
[406.83s -> 411.55s]  Ah, he can't go back. Yeah, we got to attack that tower now. Yeah, they get three down.
[413.23s -> 415.23s]  I wish one of us had a damn heal.
[415.79s -> 420.43s]  Yeah, I'm getting bracelet replenishment. I should have got that earlier. I didn't think regen would be as important as it would be.
[422.45s -> 425.26s]  Stone a guy it would be. Oh god.
[425.34s -> 429.26s]  Are we going to get the tower? Ah, it hurts. It hurts. Get that tower, Talix.
[430.46s -> 432.38s]  I'm tanking it. I can't tank it.
[432.38s -> 435.90s]  It's almost down. It's almost down. Meditation would be okay in this mode.
[436.54s -> 440.58s]  Yeah. Let's go with some defense.
[444.13s -> 446.18s]  I got some medias.
[446.18s -> 450.80s]  That Kali is going to eat media. That Kali keeps killing me.
[451.82s -> 455.22s]  Well, we're going to have five down here. I got that.
[457.57s -> 459.49s]  How did I miss? Oh,
[459.49s -> 461.62s]  come on.
[461.62s -> 463.62s]  I'm trying. It's just me and her.
[464.56s -> 467.12s]  It's just me and the Kali.
[471.44s -> 473.44s]  Yeah, say goodbye to your lane, bro.
[474.30s -> 480.14s]  Not sure if this is the best call, but I'll try it. That's right. Damn it.
[481.34s -> 483.81s]  Void stone.
[483.81s -> 489.98s]  I'm coming back. I'm pushing her up, pushing her up. Here comes Vamana.
[494.30s -> 496.30s]  What if there was a fire giant?
[497.18s -> 501.54s]  Jerm, I'm coming. Help me.
[503.04s -> 504.48s]  Kali's almost dead.
[504.48s -> 508.19s]  Her heal is pretty damn good, though.
[508.19s -> 511.20s]  I need to wait for these things to charge up.
[511.68s -> 513.04s]  All right, coming back.
[513.04s -> 516.64s]  I'm going to try and hit Kali.
[516.64s -> 519.86s]  We're going to put some damage on this tower. We're going to punish.
[523.66s -> 524.70s]  Mayjack's Blessing is expensive.
[524.70s -> 529.70s]  Ah, it hurts. It hurts.
[529.70s -> 531.47s]  Oh, Lord.
[531.47s -> 532.91s]  It hurts when I pee.
[532.91s -> 533.79s]  Oh, Gavin.
[535.68s -> 536.18s]  Gavin.
[537.20s -> 538.32s]  You three dudes, I'm coming.
[540.94s -> 544.61s]  Okay, listen.
[544.61s -> 545.57s]  Damn, I got her. Nice.
[546.37s -> 547.41s]  Get me the hell out of there.
[549.66s -> 550.78s]  Oh, God. I may.
[552.06s -> 552.56s]  No.
[554.18s -> 556.02s]  Fancy footwork. Fancy footwork.
[556.58s -> 557.78s]  Got the stun. I got the stun.
[562.91s -> 564.27s]  Get the Odin first.
[564.27s -> 565.07s]  Oh, nice wave.
[565.63s -> 568.56s]  Let's go with the Rod.
[569.20s -> 571.33s]  And Krone spin it.
[571.33s -> 572.85s]  One more. One more.
[574.21s -> 575.73s]  Kill this Agni, and then we'll push tower.
[576.29s -> 578.05s]  Oh, you guys are going to get it? You guys are going to get that tower?
[578.61s -> 579.41s]  Damn it. I missed.
[579.41s -> 580.05s]  Get start.
[580.77s -> 581.49s]  Why are we pushing?
[582.29s -> 584.05s]  Oh, that's a DSI. That's a DSI. Get the tower.
[584.98s -> 585.94s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[585.94s -> 586.90s]  There's blue. I need my heals.
[586.90s -> 588.10s]  Oh, there's so much time.
[588.10s -> 589.70s]  There's so much time right now.
[589.70s -> 591.54s]  Oh, God. But I'm dead, though.
[591.54s -> 592.90s]  You guys are all so dead.
[594.34s -> 594.90s]  Look at that wave.
[594.90s -> 595.70s]  Lovely region.
[597.06s -> 597.94s]  Boo, you have to, right?
[598.74s -> 599.24s]  Yep.
[600.10s -> 602.34s]  Just do it. You have to, right? Even if you die.
[602.90s -> 605.06s]  Even if you guys die, this tower should go down.
[607.50s -> 608.54s]  Oh, Callie's up.
[609.26s -> 610.26s]  I'll retreat.
[611.41s -> 611.91s]  No.
[612.21s -> 612.71s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[612.71s -> 613.21s]  Don't.
[613.41s -> 613.91s]  Get down.
[614.45s -> 616.21s]  Good job. Good job.
[616.21s -> 616.93s]  Beautiful.
[616.93s -> 617.65s]  I think we can kill him.
[617.65s -> 618.15s]  Now run.
[619.01s -> 621.41s]  I'm up.
[621.79s -> 622.43s]  Let's jump.
[622.43s -> 623.47s]  Oh, good job.
[623.55s -> 624.19s]  Good job, guys.
[624.83s -> 625.55s]  There we go.
[625.55s -> 626.03s]  Big plays.
[626.03s -> 626.67s]  Oh, yeah.
[626.67s -> 627.17s]  Big plays.
[630.75s -> 631.87s]  Here comes Zeus.
[632.75s -> 634.19s]  He's real angry. He wants a double.
[635.44s -> 638.45s]  Yeah, it's pretty much it's all about the just going in.
[638.45s -> 641.81s]  Even if you die from the tower, it's still it's it's worth it because
[642.37s -> 643.41s]  you have to get the towers down.
[650.13s -> 654.53s]  All right. We just don't want to all wipe and give them full free reign to do the same thing back to us.
[655.87s -> 657.63s]  So we got to try to stay alive.
[657.63s -> 658.75s]  Oh, get tripled.
[659.98s -> 660.48s]  That's me.
[661.02s -> 662.99s]  All right, guys.
[663.79s -> 664.99s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[664.99s -> 666.11s]  I came out and Insta died.
[669.87s -> 671.39s]  I did get I did help, though.
[672.03s -> 678.14s]  I'm killing.
[678.14s -> 679.42s]  That's what I'm doing.
[679.42s -> 682.22s]  I think Boo's killing.
[682.22s -> 682.78s]  Oh, Boo.
[683.42s -> 686.38s]  I'm here to fight it.
[686.38s -> 688.46s]  Well, that was unnecessary.
[689.74s -> 690.30s]  Oh, come on.
[690.30s -> 690.86s]  One hit.
[690.86s -> 691.66s]  Got her.
[691.66s -> 694.64s]  I need to buy an Aegis.
[694.64s -> 695.14s]  All right.
[695.52s -> 696.32s]  I'm going to regenerate it.
[698.29s -> 698.85s]  You're there.
[698.85s -> 699.35s]  All right.
[700.51s -> 701.47s]  The Odin's pretty low.
[702.58s -> 703.22s]  Ah, missed.
[703.22s -> 704.90s]  If I if I chain him, he'll die.
[704.90s -> 705.40s]  Oh, nice.
[707.50s -> 708.00s]  He's done.
[708.46s -> 711.39s]  I've got to make this happen.
[713.14s -> 714.66s]  Can't you use the portal in this one?
[715.46s -> 718.42s]  That's what I was wondering if you could use a portal somehow to get back.
[718.42s -> 719.06s]  You probably can.
[719.06s -> 720.26s]  If I can just catch this guy.
[721.14s -> 722.34s]  They got three down.
[722.34s -> 722.84s]  Three down.
[726.34s -> 727.06s]  Agnestead.
[727.06s -> 727.56s]  Yep.
[727.86s -> 728.74s]  Oh, we got to get them all here.
[728.74s -> 729.38s]  Got to get them all here.
[730.10s -> 730.60s]  Nice.
[730.60s -> 731.06s]  Now we push.
[731.06s -> 731.56s]  That's it.
[731.56s -> 732.06s]  We're going to get it.
[732.06s -> 732.56s]  We're going to get it.
[732.56s -> 733.06s]  We're going to get Phoenix.
[733.86s -> 735.86s]  Somebody's got to come up a few seconds.
[735.86s -> 737.30s]  We got Zeus in six seconds.
[737.30s -> 737.86s]  Zeus in six seconds.
[737.86s -> 738.36s]  Zeus will die.
[738.36s -> 739.70s]  We'll just we'll just smash Zeus.
[739.70s -> 740.20s]  All right.
[740.20s -> 740.70s]  Let's go.
[740.70s -> 741.20s]  Let's go.
[741.68s -> 743.20s]  Come on minions.
[743.20s -> 743.70s]  Let's go.
[744.96s -> 750.38s]  I'm on the move.
[750.38s -> 751.50s]  Get to Phoenix.
[751.50s -> 752.22s]  I got I got a minions.
[752.22s -> 752.86s]  I got a minions.
[752.86s -> 753.58s]  Here comes Zeus.
[755.58s -> 756.14s]  Oh, that hurt.
[757.10s -> 758.25s]  I'm on the move.
[759.13s -> 761.58s]  Now it's just the Minotaur.
[763.05s -> 763.85s]  Oh, shit.
[763.85s -> 764.17s]  Yeah.
[764.17s -> 764.67s]  Ow.
[765.61s -> 766.17s]  He's detonating.
[766.17s -> 766.73s]  Waiting first.
[767.45s -> 768.73s]  Was he got a bunch of cooldown reduction?
[769.45s -> 771.56s]  No, he's just detonating before his.
[771.56s -> 772.60s]  Should we dive the Minotaur?
[772.60s -> 773.10s]  What do you think?
[774.12s -> 775.53s]  Do we just dive the Minotaur?
[775.53s -> 775.93s]  I don't know.
[775.93s -> 776.73s]  Boo's pretty weak.
[776.73s -> 777.85s]  Jerma's pretty weak.
[777.93s -> 778.25s]  I know.
[778.25s -> 781.29s]  But I mean, I'm going to drop some medias on him.
[781.29s -> 782.97s]  We're going to have fire minions soon, too.
[782.97s -> 784.57s]  Guys, I'm coming in hot.
[784.57s -> 785.21s]  Oh, jeez.
[786.75s -> 788.03s]  Plus the Minotaur's not too right now.
[788.03s -> 788.75s]  Oh, boo.
[791.52s -> 792.32s]  I almost killed him.
[793.20s -> 794.46s]  Did you get anyone?
[795.18s -> 796.06s]  I almost got the Zeus.
[796.06s -> 796.70s]  They can't regen, though.
[796.70s -> 797.34s]  They can't regen.
[797.34s -> 798.30s]  So that's fine.
[806.00s -> 806.56s]  Oh, boy.
[807.53s -> 807.93s]  Bang.
[808.73s -> 812.44s]  I'm already in one.
[812.44s -> 813.16s]  Good job.
[813.16s -> 813.80s]  Oh, I'm caged.
[813.80s -> 814.44s]  I'm caged.
[814.44s -> 815.64s]  I'm caged.
[815.64s -> 816.57s]  Just run around.
[816.57s -> 817.13s]  Just run around.
[817.13s -> 817.61s]  Don't run away.
[817.61s -> 818.41s]  Just fight him.
[818.41s -> 818.91s]  I can't.
[819.85s -> 821.47s]  All right, go for the Zeus.
[821.47s -> 822.19s]  He's more dangerous.
[823.15s -> 824.19s]  I mean, you don't have to.
[824.19s -> 824.83s]  We're about to die.
[825.63s -> 826.83s]  Actually, just fall back here.
[826.83s -> 827.63s]  Yeah, I'm falling back.
[829.55s -> 830.27s]  Run.
[830.27s -> 834.81s]  Damn it.
[837.10s -> 837.58s]  Damn it.
[838.14s -> 840.65s]  I got my charge.
[842.68s -> 844.04s]  All right, you want to go in on the Zeus?
[844.04s -> 844.36s]  Oh, wait.
[844.36s -> 845.16s]  No, crap.
[845.16s -> 846.68s]  I just don't want to get caged.
[846.68s -> 847.24s]  Oh, the Zeus.
[847.24s -> 847.80s]  I'm going on the Zeus.
[847.80s -> 848.52s]  I'm going to kill the Zeus.
[851.56s -> 852.68s]  There's an Odin coming behind you.
[853.48s -> 856.43s]  Well, there's Ulster.
[858.01s -> 858.41s]  One more.
[859.29s -> 859.85s]  Did I get him?
[859.85s -> 860.33s]  Got him.
[860.33s -> 860.65s]  There you go.
[860.65s -> 860.97s]  Yep.
[860.97s -> 861.77s]  Oh, boy.
[861.77s -> 862.17s]  You're dead.
[862.17s -> 862.57s]  You're dead.
[863.45s -> 863.93s]  No, I'm not.
[864.41s -> 864.81s]  Don't say it.
[864.81s -> 865.45s]  I'll just kite around.
[865.45s -> 865.77s]  Kite around.
[865.77s -> 866.09s]  Kite around.
[866.09s -> 866.81s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[866.81s -> 867.29s]  All three.
[867.29s -> 867.93s]  He's going to die.
[867.93s -> 868.65s]  He's going to die.
[868.65s -> 869.21s]  Get that kill.
[869.21s -> 869.93s]  Get that kill.
[869.93s -> 870.97s]  Oh, my God.
[870.97s -> 871.61s]  Get that kill.
[872.49s -> 873.13s]  There you go.
[873.13s -> 874.19s]  There you go.
[874.19s -> 874.75s]  All right.
[874.75s -> 875.07s]  All right.
[875.79s -> 881.53s]  I need to, what do I need?
[881.53s -> 882.73s]  I have shits on a gold.
[882.73s -> 883.37s]  I know, me too.
[884.09s -> 886.04s]  You get full gold a second.
[886.04s -> 886.60s]  All right.
[886.60s -> 888.43s]  Let's go with Sprint.
[888.43s -> 892.14s]  So we both have what, one down?
[892.14s -> 892.86s]  They got two down.
[892.86s -> 896.46s]  Me and Gavin versus all three of these guys
[896.46s -> 897.02s]  ain't going to fly.
[897.82s -> 898.62s]  I got no health.
[902.64s -> 905.16s]  Yeah, that's the idea.
[905.16s -> 906.36s]  That's kind of the thing.
[906.36s -> 907.72s]  I'm just dropping medias around.
[907.72s -> 908.68s]  I'm dropping medias around the corner.
[908.68s -> 910.04s]  I just did so much damage.
[910.04s -> 911.80s]  I just did so much damage to like two or three of them.
[912.52s -> 916.59s]  Get a stun.
[918.20s -> 918.84s]  Oh, no.
[921.69s -> 922.73s]  You just run away from me.
[926.94s -> 929.64s]  Yeah, I'm going to die.
[930.28s -> 931.56s]  Oh, we're in trouble.
[931.56s -> 932.60s]  We're in a lot of trouble here.
[934.22s -> 935.02s]  I just got back.
[935.66s -> 936.16s]  Let's use.
[936.86s -> 938.20s]  Ah, he hurts.
[938.20s -> 938.76s]  No, he doesn't.
[938.76s -> 939.26s]  Never mind.
[941.85s -> 942.35s]  Damn it.
[942.81s -> 949.42s]  I'm trying to wait for the opportunity for my ulti.
[949.42s -> 950.14s]  I don't.
[950.14s -> 952.36s]  You just got to go right through somebody.
[953.00s -> 955.86s]  Nice one.
[959.09s -> 959.81s]  Nice cracking.
[960.37s -> 961.25s]  Get him.
[961.25s -> 962.29s]  Star's the only one left.
[962.93s -> 965.31s]  He could pull off something crazy.
[965.31s -> 965.95s]  Get the kill.
[967.01s -> 968.13s]  They just flame lift.
[968.13s -> 968.53s]  There we go.
[968.53s -> 969.57s]  He's dead.
[969.57s -> 970.21s]  All right, let's go.
[970.21s -> 971.33s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[973.39s -> 974.43s]  This is our moment, guys.
[975.15s -> 976.27s]  We have so far to go.
[976.99s -> 978.83s]  You know that you walk faster on my water, right?
[978.83s -> 979.23s]  Yep.
[979.23s -> 980.03s]  Now we do, yeah.
[981.15s -> 982.98s]  Don't worry, guys.
[982.98s -> 984.10s]  I'll be there momentarily.
[984.90s -> 987.07s]  There we go.
[987.07s -> 989.07s]  We got two seconds on Kali being up.
[989.71s -> 992.03s]  This is going to be so difficult.
[992.03s -> 992.91s]  Oh, Phoenix is...
[993.87s -> 995.23s]  Where's our Phoenix?
[996.27s -> 998.35s]  We haven't had a Phoenix regen the whole game.
[1001.09s -> 1002.05s]  Oh, my God.
[1002.05s -> 1002.69s]  She's solo.
[1003.33s -> 1004.45s]  I almost killed her with that.
[1004.45s -> 1006.21s]  I got her with the tick.
[1008.08s -> 1008.58s]  Sick.
[1009.12s -> 1009.84s]  All right, we got a key.
[1009.84s -> 1012.00s]  They're all about two more about to come back up.
[1012.00s -> 1013.20s]  The mana and Odin.
[1014.00s -> 1014.72s]  This is it.
[1014.72s -> 1015.28s]  It's going down.
[1015.92s -> 1016.80s]  Let's get it.
[1016.80s -> 1017.36s]  Do everything.
[1018.53s -> 1019.49s]  Oh, baby.
[1019.49s -> 1020.37s]  Oh, baby.
[1020.37s -> 1023.34s]  Did we kill her?
[1023.34s -> 1023.84s]  Yay.
[1025.79s -> 1026.43s]  Good job, guys.
[1026.43s -> 1026.93s]  Seriously.
[1026.93s -> 1029.65s]  It's intense.
