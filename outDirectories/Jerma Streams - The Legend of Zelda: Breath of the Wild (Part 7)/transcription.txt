[6.14s -> 12.60s]  I know, I know. I'm late, yeah. Is it literally late anymore? Should we really call it late anymore?
[12.60s -> 30.92s]  Should we just call it normal? It's just normal. He's tired? No. He's tired. He sounds sick.
[32.52s -> 43.40s]  Yeah, because I kind of am still. I got COVID the first week of November and it's like,
[43.96s -> 48.12s]  some days I just feel fine and then some days I'm just like, oh, my like, my throat hurts again.
[49.08s -> 52.68s]  I'm negative for COVID though. I think my body's just still kind of getting over it.
[53.56s -> 63.38s]  This is not abnormal for me. Whenever I get sick, whether it's cold, flu, any illness that's going
[63.38s -> 71.08s]  to cause me to cough, sneeze, or have a sore throat, this shit always takes a long time for me to get
[71.08s -> 81.67s]  over it. It always kind of lingers for at least a few weeks. But yeah, still kind of getting over it.
[84.89s -> 94.52s]  Milk and cheese voice. I haven't had any today. Oatmeal voice. I haven't heard that one.
[95.70s -> 101.34s]  But there's a lot to talk about. There's an unbelievable amount of things we have to go over.
[102.62s -> 119.42s]  So in my smooth radio voice, I think I'll tell you. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, so I'm going to
[119.42s -> 123.26s]  just wait a second. I'm going to wait to be able to trickle in like we usually do. Just chill for a
[123.26s -> 133.64s]  minute. Are you dreaming right now? I don't think so. Because that would mean I'm dreaming
[133.64s -> 141.80s]  right now. So if you're dreaming and you're typing here, that means I have to be dreaming
[142.36s -> 149.66s]  because I would see you write that. I would have to be asleep. There's no way we're both dreaming.
[150.38s -> 169.62s]  You're an astral projection. Weird. That's not how that works. Well, okay, but I saw it in my chat.
[169.70s -> 176.04s]  So if you're dreaming typing that, that means that I have to be asleep too. And it's my dream,
[176.04s -> 184.12s]  not yours, because I would be seeing that over here. That's my dream, not yours. Let's stop
[184.12s -> 194.62s]  talking about your dream. You know, when I hear my dream, I'm way too dank. Just me talking. Am I
[194.62s -> 200.65s]  loud? I'm a loud person, I think. That's why I try to like shut up sometimes. If I ever get like
[200.65s -> 211.70s]  really excited, I'll be like, oh, I can't wait. I'm very conscious about how loud I can get.
[212.34s -> 229.24s]  Who do you think is going to win the World Cup? Um, I don't, I don't, I don't know. That's, um,
[230.33s -> 242.49s]  football, right? Soccer. I'm just going to pick. I'm going to say, uh, what teams even playing
[242.49s -> 250.44s]  is like, it's every team like in the world, right? I don't know who's got the good team this year.
[251.08s -> 257.64s]  I guess I'm just gonna jump on that van wagon. Hey, who has the good team? This is somebody said
[257.64s -> 264.34s]  TSM. Can you imagine? Oh, dude, I think like, I think cloud nine Brazil is going to get it.
[267.21s -> 276.98s]  Yeah. All right. Who's the team that's like, everyone thinks is cool. Everyone's like
[276.98s -> 290.20s]  waiting for them to play. Cause I, let's go. It's definitely Scotland. No, Argentina. Mexico.
[290.20s -> 294.87s]  Does Mexico have a team? Does Mexico have a team this year? I mean, what do you mean this year?
[294.87s -> 307.62s]  It's why am I saying that Mexico in it? All right, let's go. I'm Mexico all the way. They're going
[307.62s -> 317.26s]  to go all the way at least top five. I don't know how it works, but they're going to be at least top
[317.26s -> 337.59s]  five. Where's your Mexico shirt? I don't know. I it's gone forever. I don't know where it is.
[339.51s -> 345.83s]  I loved that shirt. It fit me so well. I thought the, I that was like my, one of my favorite shirts
[345.83s -> 374.70s]  and it's gone. I don't know what happened to it. No sponsor. There is a sponsor today, but not till
[374.70s -> 386.78s]  later. So today we have breath of the wild. We're going to be jumping into as well as after two or
[386.78s -> 390.78s]  three hours, we're going to hop over to multiverses. Season two is out for multiverses
[392.34s -> 396.74s]  and Warner Brothers has sponsored the stream. So I'm like, yeah, let's go.
[396.74s -> 403.32s]  Warner Brothers has been very good to this channel. So, and I do, and I think multiverses is fun. So
[403.32s -> 413.48s]  we're going to try it. There's some new characters that I haven't played. What platforms is multiverses
[413.48s -> 419.96s]  on? Well, we'll get to that. We'll get to that. Cause I, I'm not so sure either. I have to figure
[419.96s -> 430.60s]  that out. Are you a happy boy? Yeah, I've been okay. I'm very busy, but all right. So you guys
[430.60s -> 444.58s]  ready? It's been a few minutes. Let's talk. Number one, the end of the year awards are upon us.
[447.69s -> 455.59s]  This weekend, we're going to open up nominations for the end of the year awards. You will be able
[455.59s -> 462.78s]  to nominate for two weeks. After two weeks, we're going to collect all the information. We're going
[462.78s -> 471.32s]  to collect all the data. It will be a voting period for about two weeks. And if all goes
[471.32s -> 478.97s]  according to plan, the show will not be on new year's Eve this year. It will be part of
[479.77s -> 490.47s]  a Christmas extravaganza. So there's going to be a big holiday stream this year,
[491.43s -> 505.38s]  hoping planning, trying to get there. And it, it will be part of that stream. So that's the plan.
[505.38s -> 512.66s]  I, but don't want to talk too much about it because it's not, we're not quite guaranteed.
[513.30s -> 518.50s]  We're pretty much guaranteed, but I don't want to announce it too hard yet. But the plan is,
[518.50s -> 521.22s]  but regardless, there's going to be an end of the year awards like there is every year
[522.42s -> 525.46s]  in the discord. A channel will open with just like we've done in previous years.
[527.61s -> 539.21s]  Will Battleaxe be before this? That is a great question. There is, there is a chance that the
[539.21s -> 548.42s]  Battleaxe stream might happen like maybe even in the same week as the holiday stream. There's a
[548.42s -> 559.62s]  lot going on. If not, then the Battleaxe stream will be like in the first or second week of January.
[560.18s -> 569.83s]  Still trying to figure it out, but they will happen. These two streams are going to happen
[569.83s -> 583.00s]  within 30 days of each other. But all right. Are you guys ready? Let's, we're going to do some
[583.00s -> 587.32s]  Breath of the Wild, chill out for a little bit. And then from there, we're going to go into
[587.32s -> 602.97s]  multiverses, which should be fun. Why do you hate being an old man? What? I hate being an old man.
[603.53s -> 608.26s]  Samus Forrest is going to come back next week. So here's the, here's the plan. Oh, okay. No,
[608.26s -> 611.54s]  I'm going to wait to talk about this until like, maybe a little bit like an after an hour. We'll
[611.54s -> 619.98s]  talk about it. So this weekend, be on the lookout for the nominations channel and I will talk about
[619.98s -> 626.04s]  it again when I, when we stream again. Um, you know, I want to just say more than one, a few
[626.04s -> 632.90s]  times GrottoBeasts.net. If you haven't already, and you want to be able to be notified and be
[632.90s -> 643.83s]  ready when that goes on sale, I would go to GrottoBeasts.net right now and sign up. We're
[643.83s -> 652.17s]  trying to gauge again, how many units we should really be prepared for. That's important because
[652.17s -> 662.01s]  that's close. That's very close. I think the excitement levels are starting to rise on that
[662.01s -> 670.49s]  a little bit because it's, it's, it's very, very close to being starting. Is it an NFT?
[671.80s -> 678.07s]  No, it's not. It's physical cards. You already knew that though. That's, and you know what,
[678.07s -> 687.69s]  I'm, I'm upset with you. You already knew that. What is this? Pinned chat. We can pin chat now.
[687.69s -> 699.42s]  Oh shit. Look at that. What? It happened. It works every time. Yeah, it does. All right,
[699.42s -> 704.23s]  you guys ready? We're going to play Breath of the Wild and then we're going to move to Multi Versus
[704.79s -> 709.11s]  and then I'll give you the schedule for this coming next couple of days. I want to get the
[709.11s -> 715.19s]  end of the year award stuff situated this weekend. We'll be back on Monday with probably some more
[715.19s -> 724.52s]  Sims 4. We have to keep continuing that McNulty arc and then maybe like Tuesday or Wednesday of
[724.52s -> 733.46s]  that week, depending on how far we get in the McNulty arc, we'll see how that goes.
[736.30s -> 741.16s]  All right, here we go. Let's play Breath of the Wild. This is going to be a chill session.
[741.16s -> 744.84s]  You know what I mean? We're just chilling today. I feel like the streams have been a little
[744.84s -> 750.07s]  unhinged to the last of the last few days. So we're just going to, we're going to do some,
[750.07s -> 753.83s]  just we're going to relax and just go shrine hunting. You know what I mean? It's been a little
[753.83s -> 765.83s]  wild. Oh, I think we need it. We need a breather here. It's always unhinged. Somebody just said,
[765.83s -> 774.92s]  do you want us to be serious? Cause I, oh shit, I took too long. My switch turned off.
[775.56s -> 783.13s]  But yeah, lots of fun things happening. Battleaxe stream is being worked on. Christmas stream is
[783.13s -> 788.89s]  being worked on. Grotto beast is coming. End of the year awards are happening. There's a lot going
[788.89s -> 803.83s]  on. What happened to my screen? Oh, it's not plugged in. Oh shit. Hold on. Wait one sec. Not
[803.83s -> 840.14s]  plugged in. I was wondering. Back here. Yeah. Reach back here. Did I get it? Okay. Get on.
[840.14s -> 846.30s]  We're going to talk about this. I'm going to talk. I've forgotten to talk about this like a dozen
[846.30s -> 852.34s]  times. I got, I got to, we have to, we got to talk about this. It's so important actually.
[857.24s -> 867.96s]  Okay. So do you guys also, does it also make you a little angry? I gotta make sure my notifications
[867.96s -> 877.78s]  are up. So every monitor always has all the inputs underneath tucked in and then in a weird spot.
[878.42s -> 883.53s]  Does that annoy anybody else that like you have to like lean down and stick your head up and like
[883.53s -> 889.98s]  pull your arms around? I just wish they were somewhere simple, like on the side or something.
[889.98s -> 893.18s]  You know what I mean? I know, I know people are going to go, dude, your cable management
[893.18s -> 896.62s]  will be stupid. You wouldn't be able to have monitors next. But I mean, I feel like some of
[896.62s -> 904.04s]  these are just so tucked in and so hard to reach. I feel like this has to be a better solution than
[904.04s -> 911.62s]  like tucked into a cave behind your monitor. You're right. Okay. I thought people were going to
[911.62s -> 928.74s]  think I was crazy for this. All right. And let me just go here. No, I don't want to put parental
[928.74s -> 945.64s]  controls on. Okay. There we go. What have I turned for? Can you turn parental controls on
[945.64s -> 962.41s]  for yourself accidentally? No, you can't, right? You can? Okay. That's weird. All right. Let's go.
[963.13s -> 982.28s]  You guys should be able to see it now. Back into a breath of the wild. Ready to play. You're going to
[982.28s -> 991.26s]  McDonald's? Oh, sick. All right. The last thing that I did. Kind of loud, isn't it? Maybe not.
[991.26s -> 1001.21s]  It's a little loud for me. I just beat the second guardian. So now what the heck do I do? I was going
[1001.21s -> 1015.18s]  to say the F word, but I didn't want to say. Okay. Let's see. Where are we going? So I just
[1015.18s -> 1021.80s]  did all this. I did a Goron city. I did the beast. It was sick. What did, why do I have all this
[1021.80s -> 1028.31s]  marked? All right. Look at this entire area over here that I have not even looked at.
[1028.95s -> 1041.54s]  Where should I go now? Go south, go south, go west, west of the volcano. I mean like,
[1042.92s -> 1049.62s]  like this way, like over here, go south, go south, go. You know, I've seen a lot of south Andes and
[1049.70s -> 1058.06s]  I think I'm going to listen. So you mean like down here, down here, down here, west, south,
[1058.06s -> 1062.82s]  like southwest, like right here. This sounds like a pretty good place to go. All right.
[1063.62s -> 1079.64s]  All right, let's go. Let me get on a tower. Let's make it happen. Move your cam. Oh, that's right.
[1079.64s -> 1085.91s]  I'm blocking some stuff. Aren't I? What are your thoughts of the, of the death of Twitter?
[1086.90s -> 1091.50s]  You know, I was thinking about, um, I was thinking about just releasing every one of my drafts.
[1100.18s -> 1107.18s]  Just like, I like guys, I'm releasing the drafts and just take like a bunch of screenshots of like
[1107.18s -> 1118.34s]  one, like 30 tweets and just putting them as images next to each other. Do it. Release the
[1118.34s -> 1131.24s]  drafts. Yeah. I'm going to unclassify the tweets. Why is it camera in a weird spot? Hold on. Yeah.
[1131.24s -> 1134.38s]  I'm a little too far forward. Okay. There we go. All right. So you're saying, so for here,
[1134.94s -> 1139.29s]  let's do, uh, I'm gonna go this way. Let me take a look and see if there's any shrines because
[1139.29s -> 1149.67s]  that's the title. Got that one. Got that one. All right. Looks like over there. Wait, no,
[1149.67s -> 1158.46s]  that's not Southwest though. Everyone's going to be screaming at me. It's this way. What's this
[1158.46s -> 1164.52s]  cathedral? Have I been in there? No, that's where I found the, the guy, right? All right. I'm going
[1164.52s -> 1176.20s]  this way and I'm going to get that tower. That's the plan. And I'm going to teleport there. You're
[1176.20s -> 1182.55s]  the guy. I don't know what I'm, I'm the guy of, but I don't know. You may have found me. I might be
[1182.55s -> 1203.08s]  the guy. How the heck is everybody doing today? Already cold. What are those? Oh shit. All right.
[1203.08s -> 1207.24s]  Hold on. So I don't want to go that way. I want to turn around and I want to, where's the tower
[1209.82s -> 1215.03s]  over there? I don't have any cold gear. It's all right. I'll be out of the cold area in a second.
[1216.23s -> 1222.14s]  Oh my God. And hopefully I just didn't die. This is definitely not cold over here, right?
[1226.95s -> 1238.38s]  Is it cold up here? Trine? No, let me get the tower first. That's, that's priority number one.
[1239.10s -> 1256.06s]  That's absolute priority number one. That hurt. Oh, I fell from actually kind of far. Yeah. It's
[1256.06s -> 1271.45s]  not cold over here. This is the Elden Ring area. Don't say what, hey. All right. Hey, do you guys
[1271.45s -> 1277.69s]  think that Elden Ring's DLC is going to get announced in the next like month? When do you
[1277.69s -> 1285.19s]  think it's going to happen? I'm so ready. I hope, I hope it's, but I hope it's ready and I hope it's
[1285.19s -> 1291.03s]  good. Don't bat-chest Elden Ring. It's like one of the best games ever made. Don't, please.
[1293.59s -> 1296.71s]  I was actually thinking about game of the year, right? Cause like, oh, the game of the year,
[1296.71s -> 1301.75s]  right? When it's coming, it's coming up. And I'm just trying to make my top five or top three.
[1301.75s -> 1308.70s]  And I can definitely say Elden Ring is number one, but also, are we bat-chesting Elden Ring?
[1308.70s -> 1314.66s]  Have we got, we have not gotten there, right? We've gotten to the point where you bat-cha,
[1314.66s -> 1320.89s]  it's like become Marvel. Like if I say Spider-Man, for instance, everyone's going to go Spider-Man,
[1320.89s -> 1326.06s]  bat-chest, that wasn't like that like five years ago, 10 years ago. Have we gotten to the point
[1326.06s -> 1336.52s]  where From Software now gets the bat-chest treatment? It can't be, right? No, I, I don't,
[1336.52s -> 1340.34s]  I don't, I don't agree with that one. No, I don't agree with that one. I think you guys are wrong.
[1341.06s -> 1346.54s]  What's this? Pump it up, brother. This is our ancestral training ground.
[1346.54s -> 1350.54s]  Us three Goron blood brothers are in the midst of a contest of endurance.
[1351.50s -> 1356.46s]  Feel the burn, brother. We're trying to become strong and powerful Gorons. Right now we're
[1356.46s -> 1364.54s]  competing to beat the heat. So sweaty. We're Gorons, but the heat is too much for us these days.
[1364.54s -> 1375.16s]  Remember, what are you talking about? It's too hot to handle in Goron City,
[1375.16s -> 1381.45s]  so we came here to train ourselves. I have an idea. Come join us. Yeah, come try the
[1381.45s -> 1390.33s]  Contest of Endurance. Okay. A guy like you has a burning passion in his belly. It's inspiring.
[1390.33s -> 1398.49s]  All right. When you already step up onto the platform, then the Contest of Endurance will
[1398.73s -> 1406.06s]  have to like take the heat or something like burn. I have to like get burnt or something.
[1406.06s -> 1416.12s]  Everybody bat-chesting Elden Ring. I can't believe it. Why? Did somebody make a post on like the
[1416.12s -> 1419.96s]  Elden Ring Reddit or something that's like, oh man, you have to have a really high IQ to understand
[1419.96s -> 1425.16s]  the story of Elden Ring. You know, like America and all this shit. It's like, did that happen?
[1425.16s -> 1436.57s]  Did that happen? And now everybody is giving it like Rick and Morty treatment. I, I don't believe
[1436.57s -> 1441.86s]  it. You guys are full of shit. I know it. Okay. If you leave the ring or pass out, it's over.
[1442.50s -> 1456.68s]  Prepare yourself for the Contest of Endurance. The air has become very hot. Okay. So what? Am I
[1456.68s -> 1465.37s]  allowed to heal or do I just have to, do I have to do fighting? All right. Condense the body.
[1465.37s -> 1472.31s]  Condense it. Make it center your body together. Breathe deeply, but not fast. Deeply, but not
[1472.31s -> 1497.11s]  heavily. Slow breaths. Condense your body. It was fucking easy. You're amazing. Is it because of
[1497.11s -> 1504.07s]  the clothes I had? Okay. I'm granting you the highest honor, the chance to participate in the
[1504.07s -> 1512.90s]  Contest of Ultimate. Oh, that was just a joke. Okay. Toughest test known to Goron kind. You see
[1512.90s -> 1516.66s]  the ring behind me, the one surrounded in fire. Do you feel it in your gut? What a bad idea it is
[1516.66s -> 1522.31s]  to go there. Your gut is dead on. That special training area is even harder than the last one.
[1522.95s -> 1527.91s]  This contest won't just challenge you with heat, but also with fire. If you lose your focus,
[1527.91s -> 1533.03s]  your body will catch fire. Make sure you're prepared for this. It said that passing this
[1533.03s -> 1548.30s]  test will reveal a shrine. Fuck, I hate being on camera. Is that heat resistant gear you have
[1548.30s -> 1555.61s]  there, brother? A real Goron man shouldn't have to rely on wussy stuff like that. Goron up and take
[1555.61s -> 1566.17s]  the challenge with, uh oh. Okay. So I can't wear heat resistant gear. So, all right. Let me get,
[1566.17s -> 1574.31s]  let me figure this out. So can I drink a heat resistant potion or something? Or is that,
[1574.31s -> 1582.44s]  is that illegal too? So I don't have heat resistant stuff. If I drink this, will it,
[1582.44s -> 1594.39s]  will I get, will it be mad? This is technically, it's technically, it's cheating. Okay. You're
[1594.39s -> 1600.71s]  going to dope, doping the fire contest. Try it. I don't want to try it because this is,
[1600.71s -> 1608.20s]  this is good stuff. Let me see if I can handle it without that. So let me heal. Um,
[1608.20s -> 1614.87s]  I need to make some new food. I got to go on like a food run because I want to have full,
[1614.87s -> 1625.00s]  at least full hearts for this. Uh oh. I'm probably in trouble here. I'm just going to go,
[1625.00s -> 1630.78s]  can I just find something to eat on the ground? Like, can I just pick up rocks and like eat like
[1630.78s -> 1636.46s]  the dirt on the ground and shit? Like, can I just eat the dirt? There's got to be just random shit
[1636.46s -> 1643.67s]  I can find on the ground, right? I'll be right back. I got to mark this because I'll lose where
[1643.67s -> 1655.32s]  this is. I can bring it to Congress. I swear to God. Bring it. A is B, B is A. Bring it. I swear
[1655.32s -> 1677.26s]  to God. No, it's right here. Okay. I need to find just something to eat. Is this a track? Oh,
[1677.26s -> 1684.36s]  I thought this was like, um, a thunder mountain from Disney. I was about to get really excited.
[1684.36s -> 1688.36s]  Do you have food? I know, but it has benefits and I don't want to eat it. Oh, whatever. I'll just
[1688.36s -> 1709.61s]  eat something. Who cares? Equip an ice weapon. Will that help? Okay. Why would I walk into that?
[1709.61s -> 1714.28s]  No, I'm taking this off because I don't, I don't trust anybody here. I'll just wear. Oh,
[1714.28s -> 1719.16s]  you have the torch. All right. So I'm going to just eat whatever. It doesn't matter.
[1719.16s -> 1727.91s]  I can get it back. Yeah. What is this? Whatever. Just drink it. All right. I'm ready. Let's see if
[1727.91s -> 1733.54s]  I can wait. I got to take all the, I got to take these clothes off. Does it matter what I put on?
[1736.02s -> 1751.05s]  Just put on the regular. All right. Here we go. Ready? Same. Leave the ring of faint and it's over.
[1751.05s -> 1767.54s]  I'm for the world famous contest of ultimate endurance. Go. Um, what else is, what is burning?
[1770.60s -> 1773.93s]  Wait, I can block. What do I do?
[1787.67s -> 1788.95s]  Oh my God. I just cheated.
[1792.41s -> 1792.97s]  Does that count?
[1799.29s -> 1803.16s]  I, that counts, right? I win, right?
[1811.70s -> 1826.97s]  I win. So epic. What a powerful display. What fire. That was something else. Nice.
[1827.85s -> 1835.88s]  Did I get a chest or something? Oh no, it's a shrine. I unlocked a shrine. Oh, that's so cool.
[1836.92s -> 1851.06s]  Well, that's a shrine or some such really appeared just like that. Am I still burning?
[1852.66s -> 1858.95s]  The legend is true. You won the contest of ultimate endurance, little man. You're amazing.
[1861.56s -> 1868.78s]  It's still burning though. All right. Well, all right, cool. So this is the shrine. Of course,
[1868.78s -> 1874.68s]  the title says it's shrine. I do need to heal though. I should probably put the fire gear back
[1874.68s -> 1888.18s]  on, right? Yeah. All right. I need to eat something because this is bad. I was going to eat the
[1888.18s -> 1898.46s]  movement speed shit. I have to go on a cooking thing, right? Movement speed. I just, I need to
[1898.94s -> 1902.46s]  I'm eating the food. I'm not going to do resident evil rocket launcher with this shit. I know I will
[1902.46s -> 1906.42s]  just eat it. Just eat it. Eat it. It doesn't matter. Well, I'm not going to make this ever
[1906.42s -> 1913.74s]  again. Just eat the food. Eat this. Do it. Why can't I press the button? I like don't want to
[1913.74s -> 1938.44s]  press the button. I can't do it. I can't do it. Okay. Don't waste ingredients. I can go on an
[1938.44s -> 1952.23s]  ingredient hunt. I just ate a legendary fish. Derma, please. The shrine will heal you. I don't
[1952.23s -> 1960.89s]  know what this shrine is. This might be a combat shrine. Reload. I thought they could be combat
[1960.89s -> 1966.41s]  shrines. This is not, was it not a combat shrine? You know that I don't. I told you I wasn't going
[1966.41s -> 1970.98s]  to get upset today and I'm already getting there. How am I supposed to know there's not going to be
[1970.98s -> 1979.06s]  like a combat shrine? Okay. No, no betting because I don't want people to lose money.
[1980.31s -> 2004.58s]  All right. So what is this? Move. Oh, wait. Oh, it's a gyro. I thought I was going to fail
[2004.58s -> 2016.98s]  that one somehow. I stopped playing chess and started just playing checkers. Everyone gives
[2016.98s -> 2022.07s]  me shit when I play this game about that. I'm just playing checkers. That's it. Don't play chess.
[2022.71s -> 2174.31s]  Fucking do it. Fucking grab it. Who's that button? Hit the button underneath it. Thank you.
[2211.27s -> 2218.70s]  I got it. I got it. It's right there. It's literally right there. I just have to be,
[2219.10s -> 2256.17s]  I have way more time than I think I do. Why did it stop? That's not fair. You can't give me the
[2256.89s -> 2269.26s]  Zelda you did it music and then turn, take it away from me. So what, how do I keep this up then?
[2287.91s -> 2293.96s]  What if I do this? That just turns it off. It doesn't do anything for me. What did you think
[2293.96s -> 2306.55s]  was going to happen, Jeremy? Well, somebody asked, what was that? Oh, somebody asked this like an
[2306.55s -> 2313.58s]  hour ago. They said, what are you drinking? It's a green tea energy formula and it's really good.
[2313.58s -> 2321.88s]  Okay. Do I, did I have it right? Is there a second one of these that I just didn't see that's
[2321.88s -> 2348.65s]  behind me or something? I have to freeze that in midair. Stop. Whoa. Nevermind. All right.
[2348.65s -> 2358.94s]  So what's going on here? You have to keep it up and I think it has to be quick. No, there's no way.
[2358.94s -> 2367.46s]  How do you do this? I just let go stand on it. Oh my God. That was so easy.
[2367.62s -> 2404.23s]  Oopsie. Rook, Bishop to E2. Queen to B11. King, F6. I'm on the wrong board. What am I doing?
[2404.23s -> 2408.82s]  That was, I just had to stand or whatever. All right. Let's take a look at this one.
[2408.82s -> 2424.12s]  So imagining you have to put out the fires. No, you have to, all right. Oh shit. Okay. So I have
[2424.12s -> 2428.60s]  to make, I have to light them on fire with that torch, which where even is it?
[2429.40s -> 2436.66s]  Why is it not lighting? Oh man. This is going to be awful. Okay. So I have to turn the water off
[2438.60s -> 2446.30s]  on each side while I, no, I'm sorry. I'm just going to fucking
[2446.30s -> 2472.10s]  light the torch on fire and shoot arrows at it. Oh boy. Oh man. Okay. What does this do? Oh,
[2472.74s -> 2491.67s]  all right. So, oh God, there's gotta be, maybe I can put one of those things on it. Can I light
[2491.67s -> 2506.50s]  my shit on fire? I don't think I can light it on fire with anything. Can I? Let me see.
[2516.47s -> 2522.31s]  This is not even fire. This is fake restaurant fire. These are fake restaurant candles. This is
[2522.31s -> 2539.67s]  not real fire. Okay. So now that I can't do that, wait, is there a torch? I can't even leave.
[2541.64s -> 2544.60s]  I'm glad nobody could bet that I was going to do this in seven minutes.
[2546.34s -> 2551.54s]  All right. Let's just do it the way that I was going to do it. And I'm going to just,
[2551.54s -> 2568.47s]  okay, we need to turn this off for a second. Oh shit. I'm close. I only need to look. Okay.
[2568.47s -> 2572.86s]  Hold on a minute. I just have to get two. Well, there's one on the left, one on the right.
[2574.15s -> 2578.22s]  And I think I know what to do here. I need to lower the one down here,
[2580.15s -> 2592.82s]  freeze it. And, oh man, I think, I don't know. I think I, okay, let me try this.
[2596.07s -> 2661.26s]  Stupid. All right. Why would you crouch? Oh fuck. There's only one more. No, I don't get it. I don't
[2661.26s -> 2724.12s]  understand. Wait a minute. I can't reach that. I can't reach it. No, it's definitely that you have
[2724.12s -> 2727.64s]  to click on this and then freeze this and go up there and then freeze that one and then turn it
[2727.64s -> 2732.76s]  and use the magnetic thing. And it's a bunch of bullshit. It's just a bunch of horse shit. It
[2732.76s -> 2741.13s]  really is. Okay. So I need to freeze this and then magnetize. I don't know. Can I magnetize? Can I
[2741.13s -> 2752.17s]  spin this without? No, I can't. Okay. Please tell me. Is this bait? Is this right here? Is this bait
[2752.17s -> 2762.42s]  or do I need to use this? Is this bait? No. Christmas tree. Give me some help. Christmas
[2762.42s -> 2779.26s]  tree. Christmas tree. Christmas tree. Football. Present football goal. I have no idea. Okay.
[2779.26s -> 2789.58s]  Football. Well, I can spin it like this and get all the ones here. Okay. So I just don't worry
[2789.58s -> 2796.14s]  about the ones on the left and right. And if I put the one, if I freeze this one and I try to light
[2796.14s -> 2800.06s]  the one on the left, the one on the right is going to put out the thing that's on the right.
[2800.86s -> 2809.10s]  So I have to freeze the one on the right and turn and then, I don't know. Here we go.
[2809.66s -> 2826.47s]  I wish I could hand this controller to one of you right now. I wish I could just hand it to you.
[2827.86s -> 2831.38s]  Like I would hand it to you and I would just sit back and just bite my fingernails while you did it.
[2834.68s -> 2842.42s]  Song Santa mallet. Okay. That hurt. Song. Sing a song with Santa mallet.
[2843.06s -> 2849.34s]  Some people keep saying magnet, magnet, magnet, but I don't know what I would magnetize because
[2849.34s -> 2861.83s]  the, what is that? What do I magnetize here? That's, this is the only thing I can magnetize.
[2862.55s -> 2875.21s]  Like pull this down or something. Oh shit. Oh, I can put that on. All right. I figured it out. I
[2875.21s -> 2894.94s]  got it. What does it have to do with Santa? Ooh, inventory is full. What do I have? Bullshit. I
[2894.94s -> 2910.97s]  can just get rid of the torch. All right. I got it now. Cool. Okay. I don't, now, now it's easy.
[2910.97s -> 2920.25s]  Now I just freeze that. Okay. I was going to say, this is so confusing. There it is.
[2921.42s -> 2939.03s]  And there it is. There it is. There it is. God damn it. There it is. Light this. What is it?
[2955.43s -> 2981.45s]  Light it. I was going to say, give me a break. Wait, what about that chest? Where was that chest?
[2983.83s -> 2992.49s]  Oh, I don't get it anymore. You got the chest. No, there was this chest. Wasn't there?
[2993.21s -> 3000.01s]  And there's just one sitting back here. You can freeze things. Omega stupid.
[3000.98s -> 3010.71s]  I have not heard omega stupid before. Omega stupid. Hey, you can freeze things. Omega stupid.
[3015.24s -> 3022.50s]  All right. So how many do I have? I will tell you because you can't. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[3022.50s -> 3037.19s]  I just wanted one. Omega stupid. That meant freeze. I don't know, man. People were doing
[3037.27s -> 3045.13s]  presents. Santa mallet. That to me, that does not mean freeze. That means when Santa
[3045.13s -> 3050.71s]  comes to deliver the presents, hit him over the head like Tom and Jerry. That's what does that
[3050.71s -> 3055.98s]  mean? Oh, the treasure chest. Okay. I'm thinking like Santa comes to get the presents. What's the
[3055.98s -> 3072.98s]  mallet then? The mallet. No fucking clue what the mallet was. Yeah. I don't know what the mallet is.
[3072.98s -> 3076.58s]  The mallets would freak me out. If you didn't have the mallet there, maybe I would have understood
[3076.58s -> 3083.26s]  that. But to me, it's like, hey, get ready, hit Santa with this mallet. All right. Cool. That was
[3083.26s -> 3106.17s]  fun. Okay. So now, oh, right. The tower. D-Gen stream. What the hell? How is this a D-Gen stream?
[3112.60s -> 3120.94s]  Open this box. What's that? I thought I just kicked it off the cliff. Oh, wild berry. All right. I
[3120.94s -> 3153.61s]  gotta take a picture of that. Got it. Okay. Because now I can search for these if I want to. Climb,
[3153.61s -> 3187.67s]  please. Jesus. I swear I was trying my hardest to get that. I was, I was really trying. Okay.
[3188.46s -> 3203.70s]  Almost there. Any more shrines up here? It's actually not even hot. I can take off the hot
[3203.70s -> 3207.69s]  gear. Oh, wait. Hold on. We gotta, I gotta be ready for this. Yeah. I'm gonna take the hot
[3207.69s -> 3233.86s]  gear off. I don't need it. I want more defense. You know what I mean? God damn it. It's all right. I
[3233.86s -> 3297.40s]  can still do it. Wait, wait, wait. Why are these not exploding? Sorry. I just like screamed. What's
[3297.40s -> 3321.42s]  that? Ooh, it's a boomerang. I can't carry anymore. I'm out of breath by the time I got here.
[3323.45s -> 3328.74s]  That's going to be the most menacing thing I've ever seen. If you imagine you have to shoot somebody
[3328.74s -> 3333.06s]  with a bow and arrow and they have a big weapon in their hand and they are sprinting side to side
[3333.06s -> 3339.18s]  and you and they're getting closer and closer, that would be so horrible because like your aim
[3339.18s -> 3358.55s]  has to be true or that's it. All right. What that, um, this boomerang over here. Okay. There it is.
[3359.19s -> 3365.78s]  Cool. This thing does a lot of damage. Do you have any shitty weapons to get rid of this? 36 damage.
[3365.78s -> 3373.38s]  That's pretty good. I get everything I got. It's good. Anything terrible that I can just use right
[3373.38s -> 3386.94s]  now? All these. Okay. The boomerang looks cool. Yeah, it does. Your stomach's killing me. Just
[3386.94s -> 3400.33s]  take it easy. You know what helps me? Ginger tea. I'm telling you, inventory is full. I didn't want
[3400.33s -> 3405.82s]  to do that, but it's all right. All right. So I need to see what, what, how I've held onto this
[3405.82s -> 3418.33s]  Renek bow forever and people just keep telling me what, should I even have this? You should just get
[3418.33s -> 3429.70s]  rid of this. Throw it away. Get rid of it. No bat chest. Keep it. What's so special about this?
[3429.70s -> 3445.00s]  I don't know. I don't, I want the higher damage. It has higher zoom. If I don't need the zoom,
[3445.00s -> 3474.98s]  my aim is pretty good. His aim is good. Okay. Where's the, there's a longer shot. I don't want
[3474.98s -> 3503.96s]  to fight you. The thing dogs can't climb. This is high up the ladder. This fucking ladder kid.
[3503.96s -> 3518.94s]  You have to shoot explosives with fire arrows. I guess that makes sense, but I'm still upset
[3518.94s -> 3529.80s]  about it. All right. So what's over here? I have really itchy eyebrow. Oh, that means there's a
[3529.80s -> 3538.92s]  ghost in the room. Is your face really itchy today? Oh, that means a ghost is talking about you.
[3538.92s -> 3568.58s]  Right. What's this for? No, dude. It's just dandruff. Like scratching my head and dandruff's
[3568.58s -> 3575.54s]  just falling on my shoulders. I'm like dandruff, clearly dandruff. Oh man, a ghost. Your itchy
[3575.54s -> 3586.82s]  head means like somebody's talking about you. Like, dude, no. No, it's sneezing. Somebody help
[3586.82s -> 3592.02s]  me here. It's like, oh, if you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you. It's something
[3592.02s -> 3600.95s]  stupid. What is it? Somebody please help me. Something with the ears. Your ear's itching or
[3600.95s -> 3620.02s]  something, right? Your ears are warm. What? It's itchy nose. I had, no, I was close. Yeah. I had
[3620.02s -> 3626.81s]  it correct. Itchy nose. Your ears are itchy. That kind of shit. Yeah, I had it right. I mean,
[3626.81s -> 3636.42s]  maybe a little bit, but whatever. It is sneezing. There's a bunch of, there's a lot of things.
[3636.42s -> 3656.87s]  What is this? I'm going to have to take a picture of that. It's having hiccups. Did we just kind of
[3656.87s -> 3662.71s]  try to find ways to make it so people are talking about us? That's why everyone seems to be saying
[3662.71s -> 3669.83s]  something completely different. Like, oh, all these people are talking about me. Oh, itchy nose.
[3669.83s -> 3676.87s]  There's a ghost in the room. Like, no, your face just hurts or itches today. What? Oh dude,
[3676.87s -> 3681.96s]  you ate that Big Mac a little too fast. Yeah. We're talking about it right now. You ate it way
[3681.96s -> 3696.31s]  too quickly and it was fucking weird. Oh, it was perfect actually. Was it? I don't know.
[3699.72s -> 3729.98s]  Why is he electrocuted? Flurry rush. This is a weird camera angle. Am I controlling the guy
[3729.98s -> 3736.06s]  and fighting Link right now? This is very strange. Okay. Which way? Left is right.
[3741.56s -> 3768.52s]  Get out of the way. Change the camera. Boomerang. Is it gone? Where'd it go? What? What are you doing?
[3768.52s -> 3789.30s]  I was trying to get it to fly back at me. What? There's a night shield, broadsword,
[3796.17s -> 3806.68s]  a lot of items here. A lot of goodies. Ow. This thing's about to break, so I'll just keep using
[3806.68s -> 3822.58s]  it. All right. This is the silly electricity monsters. Somebody's talking. You prefer the cold
[3822.58s -> 3830.65s]  or the heat? Um, I, I don't, it's, it's interesting because I kind of go, I flip flop on it. Uh,
[3830.65s -> 3841.83s]  so I live in Las Vegas and you get extremes, kind of both. Uh, sometime Vegas is like 115
[3841.83s -> 3851.78s]  degrees Fahrenheit. What did I just get during the summer? And then it gets to be like 30 to 40
[3851.78s -> 3860.09s]  during December, January, February. There's a topaz. Oh, cool. I, I bounced back and forth
[3860.09s -> 3865.29s]  though, because I love the heat. I love just a burning hot day where you just like the haze in
[3865.29s -> 3870.81s]  the air and just like so hot out. Cause as you guys know, this is important. If you don't understand
[3870.81s -> 3880.23s]  the context behind this, I am, I, I, I clothes. I like light fitting, comfortable clothes, tank top,
[3880.23s -> 3886.97s]  pair of shorts, t-shirt, pair of shorts. And I can just be the tank top shorts guy
[3888.01s -> 3910.52s]  seven months out of the year. It's a big, big reason you are that guy. All I'm saying. Okay.
[3911.16s -> 3922.06s]  You can look, it's not like 80. You can call me that guy. It's not like 85. It's 120 degrees outside.
[3922.94s -> 3930.46s]  You understand it's not like, Oh, it's like 90. No, it's a hundred and 18 degrees Fahrenheit.
[3932.25s -> 3952.58s]  You're a pool boy outfit. Oh shit. Can I sneak up? Nevermind. I don't care anymore. It's actually
[3952.58s -> 3959.26s]  very nice in Vegas now. Sort of this, uh, like September, October, November, the fall. It's a
[3959.26s -> 3967.82s]  really, really nice kind of crisp pool, 60 to 80, 60 to 70. It's nice and crisp outside. It's got
[3967.82s -> 3977.80s]  that frisbee ball scent. You can die in this. Okay. You know, that frisbee fall sent nice and
[3977.80s -> 3993.37s]  kind of cool, like 65, breezy. I'm not, I don't know. Why would I fight them? I have to just jump
[3993.37s -> 4000.33s]  to this. Wait, what is all this shit? All right. Wait, wait, wait. I just fight, just kill. Why
[4000.33s -> 4018.84s]  are there so much shit everywhere? Moblin arm. Why is it coming back without a head? I thought
[4018.84s -> 4027.13s]  you just get rid of the head. Why is this keep coming back? I got the head. I already killed
[4027.13s -> 4044.17s]  the head. Where's he going? He's just going to, he just went into the water and died. All right.
[4044.17s -> 4057.85s]  That was weird. He was telling the other guy that I was here. Ooh. All right. I gotta take a picture
[4057.85s -> 4079.88s]  of this. Your album is full. What do you mean my album is full? Let's look at them for a minute.
[4079.88s -> 4094.68s]  That's pretty good. Why did I take these? I did not, I didn't take these. Did I take these? When
[4094.68s -> 4107.26s]  did I take these pictures? I didn't take these. I did. I guess I, I remember. Okay. I remember
[4107.26s -> 4119.03s]  taking. Okay. I, these are definitely where my pictures start. Yeah. I took this one. I definitely
[4119.03s -> 4150.39s]  didn't take this one. Oh, right. I was trying to get a picture of this big dragon. Nice vacation
[4150.39s -> 4158.41s]  photos. This really does remind me of vacation photos. Have you ever tried to take a picture
[4158.41s -> 4163.37s]  or something like, Oh, look, this, this like a parade went by or there's a thing on like a
[4163.37s -> 4167.51s]  cool thing on a ride to take a picture of if you're allowed to take pictures and this is what you
[4167.51s -> 4172.22s]  end up with. And it's just like, I don't even know what this was. I guess it was something far away
[4172.22s -> 4180.50s]  that I, it's kind of cool. I guess it's a very bad photo. Your camera's delayed. Yeah, it should be.
[4182.47s -> 4200.46s]  The mic is delayed too. Cam desync. What? Like right now? Why are you guys just noticing this now?
[4200.46s -> 4221.29s]  It just got very desynced all of a sudden. What? One, two, one, two, three, four, five,
[4223.11s -> 4236.89s]  six. What? It's actually fucked. What happened? I didn't, I mean, I've been sitting here just
[4236.89s -> 4247.83s]  sitting here. Is this, this is a new thing from like the last five seconds. I don't know what
[4247.83s -> 4254.71s]  happened. It just did it out of nowhere. The mic is faster. What? That should not be happening.
[4254.71s -> 4263.91s]  I have it set. Hold on. All right. So right now it should be really out of sync. Like right now.
[4263.91s -> 4280.70s]  It should be like, holy shit, this is unbearable. Right now. It should be matching now. This should
[4280.70s -> 4314.30s]  be fine now. That's so weird. That doesn't make any sense. No. Are we good now? Is it fixed? Stop
[4314.30s -> 4327.48s]  gaslighting him. I'm so confused. Why would this happen? It's better now? That's right. One, two,
[4327.48s -> 4334.39s]  three, four, five. I, I don't know what happened. I didn't touch any buttons you saw. I've been
[4334.39s -> 4349.77s]  playing. All right. So I have to delete some shit. Okay. Delete. I just select. Okay. No, I want to
[4349.77s -> 4354.18s]  keep some of these. These are like sentimental. Definitely not these. Definitely that one. I
[4354.18s -> 4360.60s]  remember this one's actually really sentimental because you could actually, this is when I was
[4360.60s -> 4373.58s]  freaking out. It's still delayed. I don't fucking understand what's going on. Um, this is pointing
[4373.58s -> 4386.94s]  in the direction I need to go. And, uh, I was having a fucking meltdown about this. And this
[4386.94s -> 4393.00s]  is like proving that what you guys are saying is fun. Refresh that worked. Yeah. Maybe refresh
[4393.00s -> 4403.85s]  the stream. Cause I, this should be no reason why that's happening. Why can't I take a picture of
[4403.85s -> 4423.78s]  this? I guess I can't. Maybe I already did. All right. Let's do this. So it's good. All right.
[4423.78s -> 4433.38s]  I get it. I get it. What do you, what does your room look like? You're going to Lowe's?
[4437.93s -> 4454.87s]  Like the hardware store. It's just a gray background. Doesn't make any sense.
[4462.65s -> 4507.06s]  Thank God. Oh, but I've made it. You rendered on a different layer than the background. I'm fine.
[4518.60s -> 4574.92s]  Why can't I jump on this? I'm going the other way. I'm just going the other way. I'm just
[4574.92s -> 4581.10s]  turning. I'm going to go the other way. I'm going, I'm going to look, look what's over here. Look
[4581.10s -> 4587.02s]  at all these. Why am I digging through the mud to get them all here? Just put them all in here.
[4587.90s -> 4591.26s]  Just put them all in here. Why am I doing that? Just dump them all in here.
[4591.82s -> 4610.07s]  It's giving me a fresh supply, but why is, I thought, um, okay. What's the, why would they
[4610.07s -> 4617.02s]  put all these here? Tell me why these, what are these doing here? What are these doing here?
[4619.58s -> 4623.74s]  Why are these everywhere? If we were not supposed to use them, it's just a giant red herring.
[4626.01s -> 4632.84s]  Why? Why would you put them here? No, there was, that was a fruit I could have eaten.
[4655.42s -> 4667.35s]  Stop yelling. I, yeah, I did say I was going to chill today. You're right. You're right.
[4670.34s -> 4681.54s]  All right. So now I just have to grab this. Okay. There we go. Good. Now I can just jump to this.
[4682.42s -> 4690.39s]  There we go. All right. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Now I have to be careful
[4690.39s -> 4702.04s]  that I'm not going to screw this part up. I don't know what happened. All right. We're good.
[4704.09s -> 4714.82s]  God watch your skip three hours. Don't. Why do you always like lean out of the frame to
[4714.82s -> 4718.26s]  take your sip? That's weird. That's fucking strange behavior. I do what I'm going to do.
[4718.26s -> 4729.10s]  You do what you're going to do. It's all there is to it. What is this? What is this emote?
[4729.10s -> 4748.33s]  Omega stupid. Did somebody just add that? I thought it was, I thought it was a gnome.
[4757.53s -> 4810.62s]  What happened in my head? Oh, oh, mega stupid. All right. I got it. Yeah. Finally,
[4810.62s -> 4816.20s]  we have the DLC. I think I have everything. I bought the game like four years after it came out.
[4816.20s -> 4825.03s]  So I'm imagining I have pretty much everything. What is it? All right. This is like a sorcery map.
[4827.18s -> 4834.42s]  There's one mansion over here. What is this? I mean, this is where we're going.
[4834.42s -> 4847.96s]  This is where we're going. There's only one road. That's, that's where we're going to go.
[4849.08s -> 4856.04s]  There are no towns on the way or anything. We'll find out. I'm stamping it. Okay. Well,
[4856.04s -> 4877.66s]  what about shrines though? Let's take a look. I see a shrine. That wasn't a shrine,
[4877.66s -> 4893.08s]  but there's one right next to it. I feel like you would puke from doing that.
[4894.04s -> 4899.96s]  Your stomach would go up into your brain. Who's talk? Oh, they, I don't know. I don't like the
[4899.96s -> 4925.03s]  talking thing that keeps freaking me out. This you guys think is going to find Ganon's house.
[4926.07s -> 4936.17s]  Like, it's like a historical landmark or something. Oh, this is where Ganon lived.
[4936.17s -> 4945.14s]  This is his house before he became an evil mastermind with a small quaint house in this
[4945.14s -> 4964.81s]  little village. Now it's literally where he lives. I, did you just spoil the whole game for me? If
[4964.81s -> 4975.43s]  you did, then you're going to get a permanent and say ban thinking about it. Thinking of
[4975.43s -> 4982.36s]  pulling it over my head permanently ban for spoiling that shit for me.
[4989.64s -> 4992.04s]  You'd bite your tongue. That would be like a
[5008.90s -> 5017.69s]  Is it true that you hate Elden Ring? Those who that are saying that
[5019.86s -> 5026.65s]  be yelled at by me right now. No, that's game of the year. Oh, wait, I forgot. I didn't even
[5026.65s -> 5029.93s]  talk about it. Let's keep, we've got to talk about the rest of the game of the year stuff.
[5031.34s -> 5037.74s]  Elden Ring. Um, guess what else is on that list? Huh? Guess what else is on that list? What's
[5037.74s -> 5044.90s]  number two? Tell me. No, it's not God of War. I haven't played it. I'll tell you what it is.
[5044.90s -> 5054.81s]  Go on. No, it's not scorn. No, people are missing out on this here. People. I think people are
[5054.81s -> 5061.13s]  forgetting what came out this year. That is like really cool. Really unique. Oh, they can't talk
[5061.13s -> 5070.60s]  because it's emote only mode. Oh, oops. We'll go back over this in a minute when you can speak.
[5070.60s -> 5086.66s]  Okay. So this is, uh, what do we do here? Easy. I thought everyone was just Omega lulling me and
[5086.66s -> 5090.42s]  like bat-chesting me. I was like, why can't people talk about our games of the year?
[5094.97s -> 5107.42s]  So this, I needed one of those balls, which I'm just going to take one of these. Never mind.
[5107.42s -> 5117.62s]  No, we're not going to, don't add Omega mind. That's just, it's, it's pretty funny, but I don't
[5117.62s -> 5131.48s]  know. It's stupid. Not even one hit. It's going to be Indiana Jones or something. We're going to
[5131.48s -> 5147.03s]  pull this off and then we're going to get like attacked. Don't tell me I didn't know what I was
[5147.03s -> 5183.26s]  doing. Omega mind. Have you guys even seen that movie? I want, okay, put a poll up. Have you seen
[5183.98s -> 5191.48s]  Omega mind? Have you seen that movie? I feel like most people here have not seen it and they just
[5191.88s -> 5205.38s]  pretending that they've seen it. The key. Yeah. Do a poll. Have you seen Omega mind?
[5210.33s -> 5217.91s]  I doubt it's more than 50%. No, it's not. And there's no way it's no, there's no way that it's
[5217.91s -> 5228.39s]  that there's no way it's 80 plus percent of you. Stop shooting me. Okay. I've had enough.
[5228.39s -> 5253.38s]  Okay. Mega mind 3d, 80. Okay. So 81% of you I've seen mega mind bullshit. You've seen two clips
[5253.38s -> 5262.81s]  from it. You've seen two clips from it because you typed into YouTube, penis music origins.
[5265.29s -> 5280.09s]  Don't act like you watched the whole movie cams. De-synced again, dude. What is wrong with this
[5280.09s -> 5293.72s]  fucking camera? Yeah. All right. So that's electrifying the water. Oh wait, I need,
[5293.72s -> 5299.64s]  I want to electrify the water. So what's, what's going on with this? What's the problem here?
[5306.17s -> 5323.02s]  It's electrifying the water. Look, what was that whole thing with if there was batteries in the
[5323.02s -> 5328.79s]  ocean or what was it? You can let them out because now they can't backseat. What, what was that whole
[5328.79s -> 5336.33s]  thing where if you put like, okay, like how far away would you need to be if somebody put like
[5336.33s -> 5349.43s]  a battery in like, or like a car battery in the ocean or something? What was it? It was during
[5349.43s -> 5375.18s]  hitman. We talked about it. 80% of you have not seen mega mind. I don't believe it. It's one of
[5375.18s -> 5394.31s]  the worst popular kids movies. I basically, it's a kid, it's a kid's movie. I thought it was just
[5394.31s -> 5409.74s]  like a general audience movie. I don't think it was like a movie for kids. That's what a kid's movie
[5409.74s -> 5420.66s]  is, but not really general audience equals kids. That's yeah. I guess that's true. I guess that's
[5420.66s -> 5433.66s]  true. All right. Somebody get on the road. It's for everyone. E for everyone. Oh my God. I thought
[5433.66s -> 5439.16s]  that was a huge monster. I thought this was actually like a big thing that I could go. Holy
[5439.16s -> 5444.62s]  shit. What's down here? This is the roof of this place. Game of the year. Okay. So let's talk about
[5444.62s -> 5458.87s]  game of the year. I think that vampire survivors belongs there. Vampire survivors up there for game
[5458.87s -> 5471.03s]  of the year. That, yeah, that came out. Gunny rush rooms. See, I'm tired. Tired of going normal
[5471.03s -> 5476.15s]  speed. I tried rush rooms when I was five years old. Can't think of it. I ate them every day
[5476.15s -> 5483.42s]  without fail. Back in the day, I'd win every race I ran thanks to those things. But to 55 years later,
[5483.42s -> 5489.61s]  now I can barely drag these bones off the ground without those rush rooms. But no matter how many
[5489.61s -> 5495.61s]  I eat, I just keep thinking to Scooby Doo. I just won't leave. I'm just too old to pick up those
[5495.61s -> 5505.29s]  rush rooms when they grow up. Scooby Doo is such a funny character. I thought Scooby Doo was like
[5505.29s -> 5509.05s]  dumb when I was younger, but like a little bit later going back and watching, it's just like,
[5509.05s -> 5522.06s]  what a funny character. Raggy. It's such a strange character. I know like funny voice equals funny.
[5522.06s -> 5525.98s]  Oh yeah. He's got like a goofy voice, but I don't know something about it. It's just funny.
[5525.98s -> 5539.99s]  The cam is de-steeped. I wish I know what the fuck is going on here. Let me try this. I'm gonna
[5539.99s -> 5550.71s]  have to like reset this every so often. Right now it should be, I'm gonna try something here
[5550.71s -> 5558.89s]  bear with me. I have no fucking idea why this is happening. I need one sec. Yeah, Game of the Year.
[5558.89s -> 5586.89s]  Vampire Survivors. Definitely Elden Ring. Right? Definitely Elden Ring. I'm just grasping for words
[5586.89s -> 5595.22s]  right now. You know, Elden Ring. Definitely, um, yeah, definitely Elden Ring. What? But what is
[5595.94s -> 5603.69s]  this camera is so bad. I actually am going to hook up a DSLR by the way. This is the worst camera
[5603.69s -> 5607.37s]  I've ever used. It really is. I don't even know what to do with this fucking thing.
[5609.29s -> 5626.04s]  This thing sucks so bad. It's like not even funny. Why is the exposure going crazy? It's like trying
[5626.04s -> 5632.36s]  to go light, dark. The exposure is moving in and out. It's raising and lowering. See? I have auto
[5632.36s -> 5642.23s]  exposure turned off at the hardware level. This is the worst piece of equipment I've ever purchased.
[5642.87s -> 5656.18s]  This is the, this is probably the worst streamer piece of equipment I've ever bought.
[5656.18s -> 5676.84s]  Okay. Um, let me try this. Okay. Hi. Is that better? How about now? I don't
[5676.84s -> 5690.71s]  believe it's still desynced. Jesus. Are we desynced? It's better. I think I just keep refreshing
[5690.71s -> 5699.93s]  this auto exposure. This thing sucks. I'm hooking up a DSLR and I'm, everyone's going to give me
[5699.93s -> 5712.26s]  shit for it because I'm going to look weird for the first like three or four days. I look like
[5712.26s -> 5731.96s]  I'm on like fucking 16 millimeter film right now. All right. Is that better? Am I desynced? It's
[5731.96s -> 5742.25s]  better. It's a piece of shit. I, I, I'm going to fucking break this thing in half when I get this
[5742.25s -> 5763.59s]  DSLR set up. Okay. Uh, let's keep going. DSLR. Yeah. I'm going to set it up. It's going to look
[5763.59s -> 5778.60s]  so much better. You know, I'm going to turn it on. People are going to say uncanny Valley Andy.
[5778.60s -> 5796.20s]  You look like a rare steak. Quiet. Okay. So what was that mission? Something. All right. Rushroom
[5796.20s -> 5811.96s]  Rush. He's offered to trade a diamond for 55 rushrooms. I'm not going to do that. What are
[5811.96s -> 5822.04s]  you using? I'm using a logitech Brio. And in my opinion, this thing stinks. I'm just telling you
[5822.04s -> 5829.13s]  my actual product opinion. I think this thing stinks. This thing stinks. That's it. That's
[5829.13s -> 5832.74s]  my problem. That's my opinion of this product. I'm just giving them my opinion of a product.
[5832.74s -> 5854.47s]  This thing stinks. Okay. I need to make some food. Nice Amazon review. You have one star
[5854.47s -> 5867.72s]  and then an all lowercase with no punctuation. This thing stinks. And it's just a wicked shitty
[5868.44s -> 5874.38s]  like iPhone picture of the, of some guy holding it with like old man hands and the boxes kind
[5874.38s -> 5878.38s]  of toward the cardboard of the boxes torn up a little and he's holding it and he's holding the
[5878.38s -> 5885.53s]  whole thing in his hand zoomed in really close. It's always like a carpet. It's always like a
[5885.53s -> 5901.80s]  brown carpet underneath this. Always. Okay. You didn't think the monsters could have,
[5902.36s -> 5906.12s]  but they're fine. They'll be back any second now. You haven't run into any of my friends in the
[5906.12s -> 5918.06s]  room. Please let them know that sesame is waiting for them here. Okay. Bring this up. Look into this
[5918.06s -> 5930.04s]  one. Dell ultra sharp webcam. Is it good? Is it good? Or does that thing stink? What was that?
[5930.84s -> 5939.02s]  That the critic, John Lovitz, that old animation or his thing was it stinks. That was, that was a
[5939.02s -> 5957.42s]  show. No, I'm saving my rupees. Ah, that talks too much. I know. I know I really do.
[5958.22s -> 5966.92s]  Do we hear a song? It really is. People wonder why it takes me so long to get through anything
[5966.92s -> 5974.04s]  because it's like 75% me just talking and not moving and like 30% playing the game.
[5974.84s -> 5980.95s]  Oh yeah. His, his Elden Ring playthrough. What would that take him like 50 or 60 hours?
[5981.51s -> 5997.24s]  Oh, 275. No, I got, I guess what stinks is you're not grinding modern warfare to war zone.
[5999.77s -> 6005.21s]  Did you watch when I played Call of Duty a few months ago? I don't, you don't want me to do that.
[6007.45s -> 6010.49s]  Okay. So cool. So now let's get on the road. Can I get the horse?
[6011.29s -> 6032.09s]  This is not a horse outpost, is it? It is. All right. Get, I can get pranked too. This guy stinks.
[6035.83s -> 6053.05s]  I'm weird with games though. I really am. Same thing with TV shows. I like what I'm streaming
[6053.05s -> 6057.13s]  would just sit in here playing and I'm just screaming, whatever. But it takes me forever
[6057.13s -> 6063.98s]  to do anything even in my own time. So I will, Oh, I'm going to watch a TV show. That sounds good.
[6063.98s -> 6072.66s]  Episode one of Game of Thrones or whatever. It doesn't matter. And I'll be like, okay,
[6072.66s -> 6076.02s]  let's go queue it up. There it is. It's time to watch the episode, but wait,
[6076.02s -> 6079.86s]  I need to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom first. Okay. So I go to the bathroom,
[6079.86s -> 6085.14s]  I go pee. Okay. That was cool. That was fun. But I want to like something to eat first too,
[6085.14s -> 6088.90s]  because I have to be in like the perfect mood to sit here and watch this or do this.
[6089.86s -> 6093.54s]  And then I'll make a snack. I'll get some food. I'll eat it. And then I'll be like, wait,
[6093.54s -> 6098.71s]  there's no blanket here. I need a blanket on my legs while I'm sitting. Okay. Well,
[6098.71s -> 6102.39s]  I have to go get the blanket. Is it, is it, was one clean? I'll get a, maybe I'll freshen
[6102.39s -> 6106.71s]  up in the dryer or something like that. Right. It's like, it's like an hour before I sit down
[6106.71s -> 6115.34s]  and then I sit down and it's time. Why won't I fucking leave? I sit down. The show is about
[6115.34s -> 6122.23s]  to start. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm not quite ready. Let me take a shower first.
[6122.23s -> 6129.59s]  Let's take a shower. And then I'm like clean. I'm fed. I have no, there's no bladder, right?
[6130.52s -> 6152.70s]  Walk down the stairs. Horses aren't, what do you mean horses aren't allowed? There's a stable
[6153.58s -> 6160.44s]  right here. There's a stable here. It's right. It's literally the entrance to the stable is
[6160.44s -> 6174.14s]  in this area. I can't, you need to get your shield up. How do I do that again?
[6175.74s -> 6187.27s]  How do I do the shield thing again? It's like jump and then like left Z and A.
[6189.27s -> 6215.35s]  It's hot. What were we just talking about? In the desert. All right.
[6215.83s -> 6221.46s]  You're searching for Kalisa, legendary treasure hunter. Then your search is over. You're looking
[6221.46s -> 6225.46s]  at her. I've been in the game for over 20 years. When I set my sights on a treasure, you can be
[6225.46s -> 6233.42s]  sure that I'll claim it. Okay. For a second, I thought it's cold, not hot. I thought I was
[6233.42s -> 6243.11s]  really nervous. I thought I was like, holy shit. I thought I was like starstruck or something.
[6243.11s -> 6254.23s]  It's cold. I don't have any cold armor. I have swim speed shit. I have cold drinks though, right?
[6254.23s -> 6281.42s]  Okay. Mid-level cold resistance. This one's for 11 minutes. Let's go. What's over there?
[6284.41s -> 6300.71s]  Oh, it's the third guardian, the octopus, the camel. We were not under water.
[6301.67s -> 6332.17s]  That was kind of a long cut scene. Oh, fuck. Why? I think I got the point.
[6332.17s -> 6338.20s]  Like after the first two shots, nothing unusual here.
[6339.37s -> 6342.79s]  This is Karakara Bazaar.
[6359.45s -> 6362.09s]  Why is that?
[6372.71s -> 6380.28s]  A law-forbidding bow mails from entering the city. You don't know about the divine beast
[6380.28s -> 6386.87s]  Va Naboris? Supposedly it's the guardian deity for Gerudo people, but it suddenly started
[6386.87s -> 6391.45s]  acting up a while back. There's nothing we can do to stop it either. It's protected by a fierce
[6391.45s -> 6397.99s]  sandstorm and intense lighting. Though it hasn't yet, it could easily head towards Gerudo town
[6397.99s -> 6404.34s]  with this oasis. I do my best to keep an eye out from here. I don't need any thanks. This is my
[6404.34s -> 6412.26s]  job after all. The lighting, the lightning, whatever. The desert's hot. Wait, say that again.
[6419.77s -> 6438.33s]  It is hot during the day. Oh, it's like Las Vegas. All right, so let's go. Something here though.
[6438.33s -> 6450.44s]  Is it cold to go in here? Why would I wake somebody that's sleeping like that?
[6452.94s -> 6459.38s]  What am I going to do? Good evening, though. I guess it's Savsaba in Gerudo, isn't it?
[6460.02s -> 6466.26s]  But before I say any more, if we met before, I came from Rito village. Have I been to Rito village?
[6467.96s -> 6471.96s]  Far to the north of here, it's a modest village on the Kabantha frontier.
[6472.84s -> 6476.12s]  I had a great plan, you know. I left Rito village, tried to earn some money out in the world.
[6477.32s -> 6481.00s]  It's so incredibly hot here during the day. It's been tough to work up the will to go any further.
[6481.72s -> 6486.06s]  I'd like to see what Gerudo town looks like, even if I can't go inside. It's just so hot.
[6486.06s -> 6490.98s]  I heard there's an elixir that can help beat the heat. It's made from insects with cooling
[6490.98s -> 6496.46s]  effects and monster parts. They don't seem to be selling the elixir anywhere. I've heard insects
[6496.46s -> 6502.33s]  with these cooling effects live in the cold parts of the Gerudo highlands. But well, the monsters,
[6502.33s -> 6507.58s]  they're rough, to say the least. So I'm not having a lot of success getting myself motivated.
[6508.14s -> 6525.00s]  How do I pronounce it? Am I pronouncing it wrong? What do you got? What do you got? Definitely. Ooh,
[6528.07s -> 6533.70s]  summer wing butterfly. Its wings absorb the warmth of the sun. Cook it with monster parts
[6533.70s -> 6543.67s]  to create an elixir that makes you feel warm. Ooh, I'll take all of them. And I'll take 10 arrows.
[6546.71s -> 6551.29s]  I'll take all of these, too. I guess I spent my money on something.
[6556.52s -> 6586.30s]  Scam likely. Whoa, it's just lying on the ground. Oh, this is cool. I like this weapon. All right,
[6586.30s -> 6596.46s]  so I got to just get my way into, is it Gerudo? Gerudo? How am I saying it? Can you spell it out
[6596.46s -> 6622.87s]  phonetically? Oops. Everyone's saying it at the same time. Gerudo. Gerudo. Gerudo. What was I
[6622.87s -> 6638.12s]  saying? Gerudo? All right, Gerudo. I got it. Gerudo. Thank you. I need to do that. Gerudo.
[6642.79s -> 6652.95s]  Oh, sorry. I want to buy? I only saw arrows there on the counter. Oh, wait,
[6652.95s -> 6663.48s]  bow aren't allowed in Gerudo town. What do you got? Oh, all right. What do I need here? Probably
[6663.48s -> 6680.02s]  fire and ice arrows. I have 27 ice arrows, but probably fire arrows, right? Buy everything.
[6680.02s -> 6695.53s]  There's 20 rupees for one. 20 rupees for one. 50 rupees for one. What? The guy outside sells
[6695.53s -> 6727.82s]  these for like fucking five bucks. Whatever. What's up here? Climbing to the roof. That's
[6727.82s -> 6755.56s]  what I'm doing. Why did I do this? There's nothing. Wait, what am I looking for? Stop backseating.
[6755.56s -> 6762.84s]  You just pissed somebody off. You just pissed somebody off. Somebody in the chat just was
[6762.84s -> 6781.67s]  getting annoyed. Well, I'm just going to go. What are people trying to spoil? Hey, yeah,
[6781.67s -> 6790.98s]  just get on the roof and wait there. Oh, tower. Yep. I'm getting this. Here's about the main
[6790.98s -> 6818.84s]  mission right now. And there's a shrine. Sick. Where is it? The arm. I don't want to pick this
[6818.84s -> 6826.02s]  stuff. It's not worth keeping. I don't need any of this shit. I don't need any of this crap.
[6835.24s -> 6860.04s]  What? Oh, you electrocuted me. I get it. Oh, my God. Stop. Don't touch. Die. What the hell?
[6864.20s -> 6878.10s]  That sucked. This will add to the resistance, right? No, it just resets it. Sorry. Whatever.
[6879.98s -> 6901.88s]  Please don't say hell. My dad will ground me. I don't want to fight. Leave me alone. Oh, I thought
[6901.88s -> 6911.62s]  that was a rock. All right. Seriously, you just did so much damage. OK, I got to get to the shrine
[6911.62s -> 6928.06s]  right now. Get away from me. I got to make some more food, too, eventually here. Come on. Where's
[6928.06s -> 6947.38s]  the dunk dunk? Dunk dunk? Dunk dunk? Dunk dunk? All right. Oh, good. Nice fucking amber there.
[6957.05s -> 6962.49s]  So there's going to be a new category this year, like there usually is in the end of the year
[6962.49s -> 6969.53s]  awards. And I don't know if it's even worth putting on, but, like, Polly and I were talking
[6969.53s -> 6982.28s]  about it. And it's worst fake overdoing Boston accent routine. And I'm like, I said, are people
[6982.28s -> 6989.88s]  even going to be able to find that? And I don't even know if anyone would even be able to find
[6989.88s -> 7001.11s]  anything like that. And that's as bad as that. I'll be honest, that might be my favorite category
[7001.11s -> 7005.75s]  ever of the last five straight years we've been doing it. That's like my favorite category.
[7006.71s -> 7014.94s]  That's like one of my that's my favorite thing. I love that so much. It would stay if I did it
[7014.94s -> 7020.14s]  enough. I don't think I did. I think I did it once this whole year. Or did I? I don't know.
[7020.14s -> 7030.55s]  I don't even know it can be a cat. Can it even be a category? You've done it like 12 times. I have
[7030.55s -> 7044.20s]  not. No, I haven't. We got over it. We got over it. I know we did. Oh, fucking starlight kid. Oh,
[7044.20s -> 7055.69s]  my God. I have done that more than a few times, haven't I? I forgot about that. Have I done that
[7055.69s -> 7060.49s]  a lot? Maybe I've done that a lot. Maybe as we sure that's not the only time I really kind of
[7060.49s -> 7078.30s]  leaned into that. Well, if it's on there, good luck finding it. Okay, so this is what is going
[7078.30s -> 7098.50s]  on here? Monster EDF. Monsters. Oh, my God, there's a giant monster. These monsters look
[7098.50s -> 7110.82s]  just like us. Insects. Where's the new EDF? Isn't that coming up? Is it already out?
[7111.78s -> 7116.76s]  It's already out in Japan, right? I feel like I can do something with that.
[7119.19s -> 7129.91s]  We're batchesting EDF. What do you guys even like? What do you guys like? You guys like anything?
[7129.91s -> 7149.98s]  You guys, what do you guys even like? Okay, so this is where this was. This is a restaurant candle.
[7149.98s -> 7160.92s]  It's not real. All right, so what does it want me to do? Just pick it up and bring it this way.
[7160.92s -> 7200.36s]  You're too far away. Oh, that's convenient. Wait, what else is here? Okay, so now we'll let,
[7200.36s -> 7236.79s]  can I turn this on? That's down there. I got it. I figured it out. Moonlight. Yeah, this thing is
[7236.79s -> 7253.67s]  worse. Moonlight. 25, that's good. Ooh, mentor. Like, guiding moonlight.
[7257.00s -> 7284.22s]  You are at my side all along. Monsters! Okay, so I can move these around.
[7295.48s -> 7305.66s]  All right, get that out of the way. There's a lot of shit going on in this shrine. Okay, what's this
[7305.66s -> 7327.64s]  for? Okay, does that stay on forever? There's a, there's a treasure chest over here. Definitely
[7327.64s -> 7352.33s]  gonna open that. Ancient core. So what's the point of being able to do this? Can I move one of these
[7352.33s -> 7369.74s]  places? Yeah, so vampire survivors, Elden Ring, and what's number three? What's number three?
[7369.74s -> 7377.06s]  You can't talk, never mind. See, the problem with every time I try to come up with a game of the year
[7377.06s -> 7384.30s]  list, I run into this issue every time. I am such an erratic weirdo when it comes to playing games
[7384.30s -> 7389.51s]  and when games come out and when games have released. For instance, I'm playing Breath of
[7389.51s -> 7395.53s]  the Wild right now. This game came out almost, what, five years ago. I have no sense of time when
[7395.53s -> 7402.57s]  anything has ever released because I'll play a game from like 2006 and then a game from like 2018
[7403.13s -> 7409.05s]  and then a game from like 2020 and then like 2022 and then like 2019 again. So I just don't even
[7409.05s -> 7413.67s]  know when anything's ever released. So I need to be reminded of like what I played this year
[7413.67s -> 7419.46s]  that actually released this year. And you guys can help me with that when you're allowed to speak
[7419.46s -> 7457.21s]  again. Might be a while. So I gotta bring a ball up here. Ball. Where's the ball? I hope nobody
[7457.21s -> 7481.51s]  heard that. Ball. Oh, you cheated. Thank you. I don't have any lightning arrows. Where's the ball?
[7492.20s -> 7528.28s]  Where's the ball? Where's the ball? Gift sub, please. Did I fuck the whole thing up? Did I
[7528.28s -> 7532.52s]  mess up everything? Because I don't think I can, I don't have the electricity ball or whatever cube.
[7533.24s -> 7550.73s]  Oh, there it is. I should take this with me. I'll take you down with me. What's that from?
[7553.18s -> 7564.82s]  That exact way that I said that. What's that from? From something. You fall down.
[7573.66s -> 7590.79s]  Oh, Resident Sleeper. It's a puzzle game. Hey, take that somewhere else. Take that somewhere else.
[7595.83s -> 7629.42s]  There we go. I got it. Oh, there it is. I thought it was a game crash. I'm gonna bring it with me.
[7629.42s -> 7652.73s]  I think that's the plan. It's definitely gonna be something weird where I have to take it with me.
[7652.73s -> 7712.15s]  There's gonna be some chest that I can get, right? There's nothing. I feel like this would be a
[7712.15s -> 7733.80s]  thing to do. I can't do this with them. There's a chest in here. Stay right there. Right? Yes,
[7733.80s -> 7748.30s]  there's a chest in here. Okay, so I gotta move. Hold on. Just walk off. All right,
[7748.30s -> 7780.34s]  let's just get over here. Far enough away where I can move this. So I didn't even need to, whatever.
[7781.70s -> 7829.93s]  Ooh. Get ready to nominate that one. Am I in trouble? I can make a comeback.
[7859.78s -> 7860.82s]  No, I don't want to. I want to go.
[7875.43s -> 7893.22s]  Shit. Where is it? Oh, no. It's just out of range. No. I freaked out because the big cube was behind
[7893.22s -> 7911.34s]  me and it was pushing me off the platform. I freaked out. Where am I? Where am I? What is
[7911.34s -> 7941.86s]  this place? What's going on? Where the hell am I? Okay, now this... How do I get back over there?
[7942.58s -> 7960.70s]  There it is. Hey, if you do not like this in the chat, you're dumb. That's what it means today.
[7963.38s -> 7979.34s]  If you do not like this today on Twitch, it means that you're dumb. Let's do this the correct way.
[7979.90s -> 7996.06s]  Yeah, it's opposite day, so if you do ResidentSleeper, it also means that you're
[7996.14s -> 8016.98s]  having a ton of fun and shit. All right. Do I have four? I think I might have three or four.
[8016.98s -> 8032.79s]  That was kind of a cool one. That was a fun one. That is number three. Okay, so I need one more.
[8032.79s -> 8043.30s]  Levels of Copium never seen before. What did you say? Not only did you make me lose a possible PB
[8043.30s -> 8059.24s]  and Minesweeper, but I trusted you. PB and Minesweeper? Like a speedrun? All right. This is
[8059.24s -> 8065.45s]  going to sound really weird, but I just realized that I was sitting kind of like on my left ball
[8065.45s -> 8075.38s]  for the last two hours and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I've been just sitting on it.
[8075.38s -> 8083.64s]  Had that ever happened to anybody? It's like my body hurts. I just realized it right now.
[8084.28s -> 8096.42s]  No, I don't want to do the hero thing. Okay, so I got to go. Where's the tower? I want to get it.
[8096.42s -> 8105.21s]  It's like over here somewhere. Oh, look at that. I don't care. There's a tower right here. I lost
[8105.21s -> 8115.08s]  all my points, dude. You suck. Well, you're gambling. What do you mean? I didn't tell you
[8115.08s -> 8134.02s]  to do that. Yeah, sorry. I don't know that people do like side bets on this stream of if I'm going
[8134.02s -> 8146.04s]  to like shit my pants or not. I don't know what you're doing over here. That's interesting.
[8147.00s -> 8151.78s]  That's very interesting. I know how to get that too. I got to jump from the top.
[8151.78s -> 8176.65s]  Where's the tower? Wasn't the tower right over here somewhere? I did see. Did I see it? Where?
[8177.96s -> 8185.35s]  Not that one. There's another one over here. Oh, there it is. I don't think I can do this though.
[8186.55s -> 8189.27s]  Hold on. I got to go around. I got to go this way.
[8194.42s -> 8209.58s]  He's freezing. I'm going to be fine. So I'm not going to be fine. I'm going to take a speed
[8209.58s -> 8252.52s]  potion right now. High level movement speed boost. We'll do mid level. Hurry up. Equip a fire weapon.
[8252.52s -> 8260.02s]  That works. Oh my goodness. It works. That's cool. That's really cool. I didn't even know that.
[8275.70s -> 8281.35s]  Okay. So that chest is I got to go up a little higher and float to it right here.
[8282.07s -> 8292.73s]  Something to get up there. What's in there? Okay. It's like, are there five arrows in this chest?
[8292.73s -> 8313.45s]  Is it worth me getting this? I don't think I can use the magnet on it. Can I? No, I can't.
[8313.45s -> 8321.42s]  Made it a wood or something. Get the tower first. That's the smart play and I'm going to
[8321.42s -> 8326.95s]  listen to that person because that's the actual smart thing to do. We're close enough to that.
[8326.95s -> 8363.05s]  Let's just get it. Mark it. I know where it is. It's right there. Like this thing here.
[8363.05s -> 8383.38s]  Go. Can you please do a link impression? I could. Yeah, sure. You have to go all in and I'm not.
[8385.16s -> 8397.58s]  I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm ready to go all in right now. Does that make sense? Like it's like
[8397.58s -> 8402.78s]  Tasmanian Devil. You have to go all in to do it. I definitely can't climb that. So we have to go
[8402.78s -> 8419.78s]  all the way up. No, I would have swung, but anything to not use the weapon. I don't want
[8419.78s -> 8427.43s]  to use the weapon. It's nice. I would rather die than have my collectible fire sword get damaged.
[8427.43s -> 8451.03s]  Fuck. Okay. Look out below. Stop yelling things like that. It's like, no, it's like, no, it's
[8451.03s -> 8457.61s]  lame. Like don't do that. It's like an ironic joke. Like, oh, look out below you monster. Like,
[8458.33s -> 8461.61s]  I stopped doing it. I don't even think it's funny either.
[8467.42s -> 8505.51s]  That's an awful way to go. Suspicious. I forgot that emote was still here. What was the point of
[8505.51s -> 8534.50s]  that? Wait, they're not attacking. I thought they were going to, they were circling me. I thought
[8534.50s -> 8579.11s]  they were going to attack me. Shit. Do it. Oh, that's so annoying. By the way, I get figured out.
[8579.11s -> 8596.14s]  Hold on. Oh, I hate that. It's the worst. I'm trying to look at the light to sneeze. I had
[8596.14s -> 8601.11s]  to sneeze and I was trying to look right in the light and then usually it works. But the
[8601.11s -> 8609.99s]  light's not bright enough. Thank you for the Wikipedia article. Uh, and the reason why it
[8609.99s -> 8618.62s]  didn't work. This light's not on. That one is, it would have worked. I'm sitting in a,
[8618.62s -> 8645.75s]  that's why the camera looks so stupid today. I just like changed the tone of the room.
[8645.75s -> 8675.38s]  Nice gamer neck. Show us your pants. No, you don't, why would you need to see those? There's
[8675.38s -> 8684.52s]  no reason to see them. All that matters is streamer. This is, I'm streamer from here. That's it.
[8685.16s -> 8706.18s]  No. I think I saved it. I have to get high enough where I can glide back over there.
[8720.20s -> 8738.98s]  Where am I? Oh my God. I'm just, I'm going to, I'm going to be fine, right? I'm just going to
[8738.98s -> 8761.02s]  teleport to like the, yeah. Okay. Thank God. I'm sorry. What the hell? Why did he do that?
[8763.66s -> 8771.00s]  He just got sucked in there. I was trying to say Monka W, but my voice cracked while I said W.
[8771.00s -> 8784.46s]  So it sounds really, really bad. It was like Monka W. Oh, we're going to run off the edge.
[8792.46s -> 8813.05s]  Get down. Did he just run into the wall? This is weirdly placed.
[8816.70s -> 8837.50s]  Thank God. I got something for you. Where is it?
[8837.50s -> 8867.08s]  Where did the explosive go? Somebody tell me. Don't throw that. What is happening right now?
[8869.50s -> 8920.38s]  I'm so confused. Where are my weapons? You. Hi, Sarah. Not even a hard game.
[8927.70s -> 8952.09s]  I need some more shitty weapons. Roasted wild berry. Okay. I don't know what the
[8952.09s -> 8967.08s]  fuck was that? I did. I don't know. All right. So now I have to get all the way up here.
[8967.72s -> 8989.30s]  It's just tricky. The sword. Wait, where is it? You're being extra goofy today. I don't know.
[8989.30s -> 9033.13s]  Sometimes I just get in a mood. It just kind of happens. How'd you only get one? See ya.
[9049.82s -> 9080.70s]  Oh, I could have just done that. No, stop asking for sounds that are out of meme
[9080.70s -> 9110.58s]  circulation. They have been for a year and I get from here. No, it's that's that from that
[9110.58s -> 9123.21s]  that launch pad up there. Did you play Hades? I did. I liked it. I thought it was great.
[9123.77s -> 9142.23s]  I streamed it a few times. I imagine this is being weighed down to a bowling stream.
[9142.23s -> 9159.00s]  I actually don't hate that idea, but we have to go through all the sports. All right.
[9160.28s -> 9215.96s]  Oh, not all of them. Roasted hydra melon. Oh, that's 50. 20. Easy. Crickets. I'm not sure
[9215.96s -> 9225.18s]  what that's for, but whatever. I bet you can't toy boat. I did an unbelievable toy boat. This was
[9225.18s -> 9231.05s]  yesterday. Oh yeah, this was the day before yesterday. It was an unbelievable one. It was
[9231.05s -> 9237.43s]  probably the best one I've ever done. I genuinely believe that. That was the best toy boat that I've
[9237.43s -> 9242.79s]  ever done on this channel. There's no way it wasn't. Well, I need to bring that.
[9243.75s -> 9253.00s]  How many was it actually in a row? Because once you get to about six, seven, eight, nine,
[9253.00s -> 9303.88s]  10 in a row, it becomes actually like, whoa, you did it for real. Stop. You're 37. Relax.
[9303.88s -> 9334.20s]  Top 10 gamer rage moments. Jerma985 had a little bit of trouble with the magnetic box puzzle
[9334.20s -> 9387.99s]  next to Gerudo Village. I have to go all the way down here. Number 15. Yeah.
[9420.44s -> 9430.62s]  Top 15. Yeah. Moments. I was wanting to make a parody of those and have it just be something
[9430.62s -> 9441.59s]  so dumb and specific that nobody has done. We're going to go over the top 15. Let's go is on Twitch.
[9444.06s -> 9458.36s]  Like why? Who cares? We're going to go over the top five. Let's freaking go.
[9460.52s -> 9479.19s]  I want to do it so bad and have me be number one. Yeah. Oh, top 10. Ooh. Oh,
[9479.35s -> 9489.40s]  ooh. And there's 10 different streamers doing this. You know, get like a bunch of top streamers
[9489.40s -> 9495.80s]  just to like do it for a joke. Like, oh my God, I can't believe it happened. It's like a thing
[9495.80s -> 9512.89s]  people do. And of course I would still be number one. I would be the top three spots. Like I got
[9512.89s -> 9541.72s]  this meme locked down. This thing's kind of dumb. Why do I have a smoky eye today? The lighting is
[9541.72s -> 9552.62s]  wrong. You know, just make something up that no one has said. Make a new phrase that people
[9552.62s -> 9593.51s]  do in times of exclamation. Somebody said I had white walker makeup on. Here we go. It's time to
[9593.51s -> 9599.45s]  jump. I got to land this. I've got to get it. Even if people are going to scream, no, this is wrong.
[9599.45s -> 9637.98s]  I'm doing it. I've already done it. Very good. Let's freaking go. Let's go and make this fake
[9637.98s -> 9647.02s]  exclamation higher and rent out a whole huge place and have a fake land and have people playing
[9647.02s -> 9652.30s]  street fighter and have like a hundred people in the audience and somebody wins the tournament
[9652.30s -> 9660.52s]  or whatever it is. And they, they say the thing. And that's like number two. This is not real.
[9661.16s -> 9686.17s]  Yeah. Where's this accordion coming from? What does this open? Everybody in the audience,
[9686.17s -> 9688.81s]  it's just like on the count of three, like here we go. He's going to say it. Everybody
[9689.69s -> 9696.38s]  fucking scream. I have two commentators just talking. There's a person here,
[9698.41s -> 9703.93s]  really intense commentary and they all kind of say it too afterwards. It's like a big thing.
[9703.93s -> 9712.82s]  People do, you know, like sometimes I just really wish I had just like unlimited money.
[9713.38s -> 9734.07s]  I would just do this stuff like once a week. So what's going on up here? What did you get from
[9734.07s -> 9739.86s]  McDonald's earlier? Didn't go to McDonald's earlier. Now somebody else was saying they're
[9739.86s -> 9756.78s]  going to McDonald's. I hope to play the song for the hero someday. Wait a minute. Hey,
[9756.78s -> 9787.64s]  I think we're going to hear it about me. Let's hear it. Oh, here it goes. Prize. I wasn't looking
[9787.64s -> 9798.71s]  at all. I just haven't read the last word. Let's do it again. Cause I wasn't listening. I was
[9798.71s -> 9808.73s]  looking over at the chat. What was it? It said something about a prize. Oh, that's all right.
[9808.73s -> 9813.67s]  I got it right here. As light shines from the Northwest skies from the towers, shadow and
[9813.67s -> 9821.29s]  arrow flies. Here's heaven's light to reveal the prize. Solve the riddle of the ancient song.
[9821.29s -> 9829.06s]  Okay. A light shines from the Northwest skies. Where is North? Light shines from the Northwest
[9829.06s -> 9849.32s]  skies. That's the sun from the tower shadow and arrow flies. There's the shadow. Okay. From the
[9849.32s -> 9887.03s]  shadows ta whereas what is it? Here's heaven's light to reveal the prize from the shadows tower.
[9887.03s -> 9895.72s]  There emits a prize through the light of the beam. You'll get adjust your eyes. I don't get it.
[9896.36s -> 9916.36s]  As the sun shines from Northwest, the tower shadow and shoot an arrow at the shadow. Here's
[9916.36s -> 9934.22s]  heaven's light. Shoot an arrow. I'm just gonna do it. Whatever. Or is that fire? Is this like
[9934.22s -> 9952.38s]  you have to shoot the top and blight at the top of fire shadow of the tower when the sun is North.
[9952.38s -> 9963.94s]  I think I missed my opportunity. Yeah. I missed my opportunity. But do I have to wait? How do I do
[9963.94s -> 10003.83s]  this? How does it work? Is it that thing? I think it might be that thing. Come on. It's not. Oh,
[10019.29s -> 10053.51s]  oh, the shadow is gone. Can I sleep till morning? How do you pass time? How do I pass time? I'm
[10053.51s -> 10064.84s]  just said this part and Oliver sounds like the arcade game sound effects. What? Okay. So it's
[10064.84s -> 10069.64s]  I just fire, but fire. Well, where do I have to put the fire? What time is it? It's 10 PM.
[10070.44s -> 10091.30s]  It's got to be with the sun shining. I'm not stupid. I know one day I want to just hire
[10091.30s -> 10096.50s]  CG artists to put like an overlay over like an app, like a food blog. Just be like,
[10097.30s -> 10125.26s]  and have like a freak out. Why is it taking 10 minutes to travel? Not like this, not like this,
[10125.26s -> 10150.26s]  not like this. This guy sucks. Not like this. This guy sucks. I have to burn this. I have to
[10150.26s -> 10162.84s]  blight this on fire. I have to burn that. No, what's this tent you guys are talking about?
[10162.84s -> 10177.72s]  There's no tent. The shrine right there. Wait, what? Tent? You mean like hit like this, burn
[10177.72s -> 10183.24s]  that that tent hit instead of that. You want me to burn this? What do you want me to burn this?
[10183.80s -> 10192.02s]  I'm going to burn that. No, burn the tent, burn the tent, fire, tent, fire, tent.
[10192.98s -> 10234.90s]  What? Oh, that looks like a tent. No, what do you want me to burn? Bomb, tent, fire,
[10234.90s -> 10241.72s]  resident sleeper, tent, fire, resident sleeper, fire, sleep, sleep, fire, go to sleep and then
[10241.72s -> 10250.76s]  do a fire. How do you sleep? Sleep, Doritos, sleep at the fire, sleep at the fire. There's a fire
[10250.76s -> 10254.68s]  somewhere. I don't, there's no fire though. Where are you? Should I jump down from here?
[10254.68s -> 10268.28s]  Should I jump down right there? Should I jump down right here? Jump down here. That's a lot of nos.
[10268.28s -> 10336.44s]  Okay. Um, what's that? Is that it? Ow. Okay, fire. Did I miss my opportunity or something?
[10336.44s -> 10345.11s]  Tent, fire. What's the, where's there a tent? I missed my opportunity. So I have to sit. All
[10345.11s -> 10354.94s]  right. How do I, is there like a drink I can drink that speeds time up? Tent. What is a tent? I don't
[10354.94s -> 10399.06s]  have any tents. Okay. This would, Oh, I didn't know you could do that. Now I shoot this one.
[10399.06s -> 10405.85s]  I'm going to, I gotta be ready now. This is going to start glowing and then I shoot it with a fire
[10405.85s -> 10429.08s]  arrow. No. Huh? What do you mean? No. Just do I just stand in this? I don't understand what you mean.
[10429.08s -> 10459.99s]  Just stand in it. Okay. I, I, I 6,000 viewers left, almost 7,000. Okay. Here we go. Okay.
[10459.99s -> 10503.10s]  What's going on? Where is it? Here it comes. This is it. I am playing with fire right now for no
[10503.10s -> 10521.26s]  reason. Here it comes. Fire, sun, sun, sun, shoot the sun. Shoot the sun with a fire arrow or just
[10521.26s -> 10569.46s]  shoot the sun. Oh, it's not time yet. You guys didn't have anything to do today. Let's go up.
[10569.46s -> 10608.70s]  Is it a shrine? Oh, it's a shrine. My favorite thing. Cool. I wonder what's in here. This is
[10608.70s -> 10627.90s]  a secret. I like these little secrets. It was supposed to be a campfire. I thought you were
[10627.90s -> 10635.77s]  trying to tell me to shoot the tents, like the camps, like you need to burn that tent over there.
[10635.77s -> 10645.21s]  I don't know. So this is a test of a modest test of strength. All right. Well,
[10645.21s -> 10654.50s]  let's go ahead and get this ready. Damage food. Maybe. Yeah. Why not?
[10657.94s -> 10661.46s]  I got my really good guardian weapon that I've been saving for this exact moment
[10662.18s -> 10703.82s]  and I'm ready. I hate you already.
[10720.65s -> 10755.10s]  Oh, take him out. Take him out before he does anything. Take him out.
[10759.93s -> 10770.01s]  A lot of stuff there. That wasn't that bad. Guardian sword plus. It's a 60 damage.
[10778.12s -> 10789.58s]  Oh yeah. I get rid of this. Guardian spear. All this stuff. Nice. Okay. So this would give me
[10789.58s -> 10792.78s]  four and I can upgrade. What should I upgrade? Health or I'm going to do stamina, I think.
[10793.50s -> 10808.54s]  What do you guys think? Frost blade. Oh, that's really cool. That's so cool. And I don't know
[10809.50s -> 10819.75s]  sword. Oh, this spear is really not that great. Actually, what is the spear better than the sword?
[10820.82s -> 10834.62s]  Yeah, probably not. Health for the master sword. That's really cool looking. All right. Cool. So
[10834.62s -> 10848.14s]  I'll do health. Find a shrine. Does the master sword break? That's yeah. Does the master sword
[10848.14s -> 10865.66s]  break? That would be okay. It doesn't. Pepe laughed. All right. Well, I don't know. Kind
[10865.66s -> 10873.46s]  of not really, but yes. All right. Well, that helps. Don't worry. I'm just not going to use
[10873.46s -> 10878.38s]  it once and just throw it again at the end of the game. People think that's a joke, but I'm
[10878.38s -> 10883.82s]  actually going to do that and see if I can beat it. Collect all the legendary weapons and just
[10883.82s -> 10896.58s]  throw them all again. Okay. It is time for us. It's been about three hours. It's time to move
[10898.01s -> 10905.35s]  here to sponsored part of the stream. We're going to play multiverses for a couple hours or so.
[10905.35s -> 10910.95s]  I do want to get to, I do want to do that. Yeah. Let me just make sure I'm where I want to be
[10910.95s -> 10932.33s]  the next time. Yeah. Season two of multiverses is I think started today. Just a couple of new
[10932.33s -> 10936.10s]  characters that I haven't played with. I think they just announced, um, what did they just
[10936.10s -> 10944.89s]  announce? Hold on. When is frog detective going to happen? Frog detective is going to happen when
[10944.89s -> 10954.23s]  my, when I can do voices, one of three voices. So I'm going to take a quick BRB. We'll move to
[10954.23s -> 10958.87s]  multiverses. It's going to be sponsored by Warner Brothers. They've been really good to the channel.
[10958.87s -> 10963.19s]  I have not played multiverses in a little while. This ranked now. So I'll be trying that out.
[10963.19s -> 10971.94s]  Probably going to rage quit it in five minutes. They announced Marvin, right? Marvin Martian.
[10971.94s -> 10979.66s]  That's funny. Where's Daffy Duck? I want Daffy Duck. All right. I'll be right back. Uh,
[10979.66s -> 10983.42s]  going to get everything set up. Should be like maybe a few minutes. And thanks for watching
[10984.22s -> 10988.84s]  the, uh, this portion of the stream, breath of the wild. I'm still enjoying it. We'll see it again
[10988.84s -> 10997.27s]  soon. I'll be right back. I'm for multiverses. I am going to do a couple of things first before
[10997.27s -> 11010.81s]  I go there. Like for instance, this doesn't need to be on anymore and neither does this. That looks
[11010.81s -> 11019.37s]  good. Okay. I will be right back. See you guys in two, three minutes, maybe a little bit more.
