[0.31s -> 20.76s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Turma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Spy with the Ambassador, the Kunai, and the Dead Ringer.
[20.76s -> 27.06s]  My typical Spy setup, a lot of you guys know that. This video is going to discuss the Spy.
[27.06s -> 33.06s]  It's gonna be kind of a casual commentary, I'm gonna sit back and talk about things, relax, drink a few Dr. Peppers, you know, crack one open.
[33.06s -> 38.06s]  If I had one, I would, but I have one already open, so that joke does not exist because I can't make it.
[38.06s -> 44.43s]  But I want to talk about the old Spy. Those of you that will remember, and I don't know why I thought about this.
[44.43s -> 51.43s]  When I was getting this gameplay, I thought about it because there's a couple of instances where my knife comes down really quickly and I was like, you know what?
[51.43s -> 62.09s]  Wasn't there a time when the Spy didn't have that? And there wasn't. For those of you that do not know, the Spy's backstab animation never was like this.
[62.09s -> 66.09s]  It was never this quick a few years ago. Actually, it was probably more than that.
[66.09s -> 71.09s]  But it was when the game came out. When the game came out, and maybe for like six, seven, eight months after the game came out,
[71.09s -> 78.46s]  the backstab animation took almost a full second to complete. You brought the knife up, and then you brought the knife down.
[78.46s -> 84.46s]  It was kind of slow in comparison to what it is right now, where it's almost a quarter of a second when you stab somebody.
[85.46s -> 93.46s]  It was much longer than that. I'm going to put a link in the description here of what it looks like compared to what it looks like now.
[93.46s -> 102.08s]  I'm old. Seriously. I thought about this, and this change happened when I was in college.
[102.08s -> 107.08s]  It's almost four or five years ago now that this change was made.
[107.08s -> 112.32s]  I remember sitting in my college dormitory and being like, oh wow, they changed the backstab animation.
[112.32s -> 119.99s]  I'm young and fun and young and good looking. Fast forward a little bit. I'm an old shithead.
[119.99s -> 126.99s]  I'm just sitting here drinking Dr. Pepper's five years later. I really can't even believe that it's been five years since that change.
[126.99s -> 133.99s]  This is also kind of around the time when they added the compression blast to the Pyro, because the Pyro never had the compression blast.
[133.99s -> 140.42s]  I'm just going through all these changes in my head and thinking to myself, if you were to tell me when I was in college,
[140.42s -> 144.92s]  all this stuff is going to be hats. There's going to be new backstab animations.
[144.92s -> 147.92s]  Pyro's going to have a thing that knocks people away with this compression blast.
[147.92s -> 151.16s]  If you told me all this stuff, I would say, what the hell are you talking about?
[151.16s -> 156.16s]  TF2 is just like a fun multiplayer game that I play online sometimes.
[156.16s -> 166.16s]  I would have never believed that this would have turned into the TF2 Hat Combat Simulation Virtual Reality Burger Boy 2012 Emperor of Earth.
[166.16s -> 168.16s]  I would never have been able to guess that.
[168.16s -> 173.85s]  So what's the point here? Why did I make this video? What's the point of me making this video?
[173.85s -> 186.13s]  The point is, from right now, July 22nd, 2013, where is this game going to be five years from now?
[186.13s -> 196.61s]  In 2018, if TF2 still has an active community, if they're still making updates, or if TF3 comes out, what the hell are they going to do?
[196.61s -> 200.61s]  How are they going to change this game even more than they already have drastically done it?
[200.61s -> 206.61s]  And I don't think anyone will ever be able to foresee it, because nobody could foresee that there was going to be a hat economy.
[206.61s -> 212.61s]  Who the hell knew that was going to happen? Who in their right mind could have ever said that TF2 was going to have a hat economy?
[212.61s -> 217.04s]  What? What are you talking about?
[217.04s -> 220.04s]  And it interests me for a very specific reason.
[220.04s -> 223.28s]  It's because when you get older and you look back at the games that you've been playing,
[223.28s -> 228.28s]  and you look back at the games that have been out for a very long time, that have undergone huge, drastic changes,
[228.28s -> 232.95s]  and you can remember back to when the game was completely different,
[232.95s -> 236.95s]  it's kind of sad and kind of a little depressing, but it's cool at the same time,
[236.95s -> 241.95s]  because you get to see from the beginning of a game's life to where it's currently standing,
[241.95s -> 246.95s]  and you get to see all the changes, all the things that happened, and it sort of reminds me,
[246.95s -> 250.95s]  now we're going a little bit deeper here, but the console generations.
[250.95s -> 255.95s]  I've been alive long enough to see all the console generations,
[255.95s -> 263.95s]  all the way back from the Atari almost, the regular Nintendo, the whole Super Nintendo, N64, PlayStation 1,
[263.95s -> 267.95s]  all those generational changes. I've seen everything.
[267.95s -> 276.51s]  And it's crazy to think about Team Fortress 2 has gone through just about one and a half console generations.
[276.51s -> 282.51s]  I mean, it started during the midst of the Xbox 360 and the PS3, the prime of those two consoles,
[282.51s -> 286.51s]  2006, 2007, everybody had one, everyone was using one,
[286.51s -> 292.51s]  and we're going to go into the Xbox One and the PS4, and TF2 is still here, still actively played.
[292.51s -> 298.51s]  So it's done its own, in quotes, console generational leaps, if that makes any sense.
[298.51s -> 303.75s]  And I truly do wonder if TF2 eventually, if there is no TF3,
[303.75s -> 310.75s]  if they will do some type of source 2.0 port, because I'm sure a lot of you guys know the source engine,
[310.75s -> 313.75s]  the new source engine is currently being worked on.
[313.75s -> 318.75s]  So a world where we would see maybe another generational jump for this game, Team Fortress 2,
[318.75s -> 323.75s]  is a complete graphical reworking or a port to the new source engine.
[323.75s -> 327.75s]  I don't know if that's going to happen. It's obviously just wishful thinking at this point,
[327.75s -> 329.75s]  because who knows what Valve's going to do with this game.
[329.75s -> 332.75s]  Nobody knows, but that's really where I want to take this video.
[332.75s -> 334.75s]  I just want to wrap it up here, guys.
[334.75s -> 337.75s]  A quick little casual commentary about the spy and then transitioning,
[337.75s -> 342.75s]  kind of going off on a tangent about consoles and stuff, but that's going to wrap it up here.
[342.75s -> 345.75s]  I'll see you guys all next time. Thank you all so much for watching.
[345.75s -> 347.75s]  I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[347.75s -> 350.75s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
