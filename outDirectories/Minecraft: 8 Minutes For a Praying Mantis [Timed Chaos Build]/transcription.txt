[0.31s -> 16.38s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? I am the Cactus. Welcome to another Timed Chaos build.
[16.38s -> 22.81s]  And I'm like stuck down here like this. Hey, do not close me in. This is...
[22.81s -> 30.24s]  No, I'm stuck. Okay. This is a Timed Chaos build, like I said, with MLC Stealth and Italics.
[30.24s -> 35.39s]  Hello, gentlemen. Hi. How's it going, German viewers?
[35.39s -> 41.13s]  Hi. So this week's episode, we are going to build a praying mantis.
[41.13s -> 46.13s]  This could be the toughest one yet, considering it's a praying mantis and it's incredibly difficult.
[46.13s -> 50.86s]  So we're going to have eight minutes, just like last time, to build this thing.
[50.86s -> 55.49s]  And... are you guys ready? Wait, where are we doing this? Like, right here?
[55.49s -> 61.86s]  In the shadow of the giant back here, I guess. I don't know. Let me change it back to daytime.
[61.86s -> 69.86s]  The cheese guy? The guy that's like a block of American cheese?
[69.86s -> 73.86s]  We've got plenty of area to work with here. Hey, we need that space.
[73.86s -> 82.02s]  He's building a grass trophy. Alright, he's building something that's really, like, not allowed.
[82.02s -> 86.84s]  Are you ready? I don't know what this is. I'm going to start the timer and then we're going to be in a lot of trouble.
[86.84s -> 93.81s]  So are you ready? Nope, because I've got to delete this thing. Alright, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[93.81s -> 101.98s]  Alright, and in three... Wait, what are we building again? Hold on. A praying mantis. We went over this.
[101.98s -> 105.98s]  Alright, praying mantis in three, two, one, go.
[105.98s -> 109.54s]  Alright, where's the front? Where's the back? I don't know.
[109.54s -> 115.54s]  I don't know what a praying mantis looks like. Alright, start with the legs. There's like four finely little legs.
[115.54s -> 118.54s]  Alright, so he's got four... No, he only has two legs, doesn't he?
[118.54s -> 122.71s]  You guys just get started. I'm Googling praying mantis. I think he's got four.
[122.71s -> 129.59s]  No, I think a praying mantis has... I don't know. No, he has two. He crawls on his hands and knees, doesn't he?
[129.59s -> 132.59s]  Why didn't we look up what a praying mantis looks like?
[132.59s -> 136.83s]  I'm pretty sure he's only got... I think he's got four legs. Wait, I don't have the color green wool.
[136.83s -> 140.01s]  He has four legs. That's Google Images here.
[140.01s -> 144.44s]  He has four legs? Now where are they? Oh my god, what are you doing?
[144.44s -> 147.44s]  I'm building a big spiny leg. Looks like a vulture.
[147.44s -> 149.87s]  We didn't put the green on the same color.
[149.87s -> 152.87s]  Well, we're using dark green, or whatever the darker one is.
[152.87s -> 154.87s]  Alright, like, why can't I put a block down here?
[154.87s -> 159.87s]  See, here's his legs. So that's... Okay. He's gonna be like a grasshopper.
[159.87s -> 165.06s]  He's gonna come out this way.
[165.06s -> 168.06s]  Or delete all of my blocks if you want to.
[168.06s -> 170.06s]  Wait, how do you place a block? Oh, right click.
[170.06s -> 172.06s]  How do you place a block?
[172.06s -> 174.06s]  How do you place a block?
[174.06s -> 176.06s]  I was left clicking and I was like, why is it destroying everything?
[176.06s -> 180.68s]  So wait, are his four legs bad? I gotta look up what he looks like.
[180.68s -> 184.48s]  No, he's got a really long body.
[184.48s -> 188.78s]  Yeah, he's got like two in the front and then two on the side, like right next to him.
[188.78s -> 192.78s]  And then a really long body in the back with wings on top.
[193.78s -> 195.78s]  This looks like a goose.
[198.37s -> 199.37s]  Okay, so let's...
[199.37s -> 201.37s]  Like a little sphere body. You know what I'm saying?
[201.37s -> 204.12s]  See, like three blocks wide.
[204.12s -> 206.12s]  Four blocks.
[206.12s -> 207.12s]  Alright, so...
[207.12s -> 209.12s]  So, don't make it any wider than this.
[209.12s -> 212.12s]  And just make his body come out to touch the blocks. You know what I'm saying?
[212.12s -> 215.12s]  Alright, good thing we're making like a goose grasshopper. This is perfect.
[215.12s -> 218.49s]  Yeah, currently we're making... I don't know what this is.
[218.49s -> 222.43s]  It looks like some kind of jungle gem is what it looks like.
[222.43s -> 224.43s]  I don't know.
[224.43s -> 225.67s]  Let's make the slide.
[225.67s -> 227.67s]  Oh look, we're making another horse.
[227.67s -> 229.67s]  It's the same thing as the horse.
[229.67s -> 231.67s]  It's a green horse.
[231.67s -> 234.67s]  His body's gonna be so much longer than this, like way longer.
[234.67s -> 235.67s]  Like, hold on.
[235.67s -> 237.67s]  Yeah, it's gotta go out past the legs.
[237.67s -> 239.67s]  I was building like his chest now.
[239.67s -> 242.67s]  Alright, I'll start building his neck, I guess.
[242.67s -> 245.67s]  Wait, I thought that's what I was doing just now.
[245.67s -> 247.67s]  Oh, is that the front or is this the front?
[247.67s -> 252.23s]  He's not like a giraffe. It has to come out long like this.
[253.23s -> 256.23s]  Yeah, the neck goes out pretty far.
[256.23s -> 258.23s]  And he's got his like scissor hands.
[258.23s -> 261.23s]  Wait, shouldn't he be looking up right now?
[261.23s -> 263.23s]  Start going up.
[263.23s -> 265.23s]  Yeah, why is he going so far like left?
[265.23s -> 267.23s]  What is this, Jerma, what is this?
[267.23s -> 270.66s]  Dude, he's like looking at something.
[270.66s -> 272.66s]  Like, he looks up.
[272.66s -> 275.66s]  Alright, well then stop going up right now, from here.
[275.66s -> 278.98s]  Alright, I'm building.
[278.98s -> 281.98s]  Because his legs start where he starts going up.
[284.15s -> 287.15s]  Hold on, we gotta redo the legs then.
[288.15s -> 291.15s]  I'm working on the tail or something back here.
[291.15s -> 293.15s]  Alright, three minutes have gone by.
[293.15s -> 297.40s]  Oh, good.
[297.40s -> 299.40s]  Three minutes already.
[299.40s -> 300.40s]  Alright, this just looks like...
[300.40s -> 304.09s]  Seriously, I just made a giant like man's arm.
[304.09s -> 306.97s]  Like, this is like not even...
[306.97s -> 309.40s]  This might actually come together pretty well.
[309.40s -> 311.40s]  I don't know, I'm not convinced yet.
[311.40s -> 313.40s]  Wait, what's going on with his leg?
[313.40s -> 315.58s]  This is his leg.
[315.58s -> 318.14s]  Why is this here then?
[318.14s -> 319.57s]  Why is what where?
[319.57s -> 321.57s]  Oh wait, are these the T-Rex arms?
[321.57s -> 324.06s]  One of the things I'm making out, these are...
[324.06s -> 326.06s]  He has four legs.
[326.06s -> 328.37s]  What have we made here?
[328.37s -> 330.37s]  Alright, I'll make his face.
[330.37s -> 332.54s]  This will be his face then.
[332.54s -> 334.54s]  What happened?
[334.54s -> 336.91s]  What have you done to Gumby?
[336.91s -> 340.91s]  Looks like somebody put Gumby on the torture rack and then like stretched him out.
[340.91s -> 343.54s]  What have you done to Gumby?
[343.54s -> 347.80s]  This looks like some sort of dinosaur.
[347.80s -> 350.80s]  Oh, good thing we brought Gumby to the medieval times and put him on like the stretcher.
[350.80s -> 354.13s]  The breastplate stretcher.
[354.13s -> 356.13s]  Alright, I'm making some wings.
[356.13s -> 359.01s]  Alright, time to make his arms.
[359.01s -> 364.18s]  Alright, I'm gonna work on his head.
[364.18s -> 366.18s]  Four minutes and twenty seconds of Gumby.
[366.18s -> 368.42s]  If I cover up his body with the wings...
[368.42s -> 372.58s]  Wait, this thing has wings?
[372.58s -> 374.82s]  Yeah, dude.
[374.82s -> 376.82s]  Wait, wait.
[376.82s -> 378.82s]  Prey mantises have wings.
[381.95s -> 383.95s]  Dude, this thing...
[383.95s -> 386.32s]  We're making like a centaur.
[386.32s -> 388.32s]  This is not a preying mantis.
[388.32s -> 390.32s]  This is a centaur.
[394.32s -> 396.32s]  I did the arms like so wrong.
[396.32s -> 398.32s]  He's like...
[398.32s -> 400.32s]  He's got the same arms as the dude behind him.
[400.32s -> 402.32s]  Come over here where I am, right here behind you.
[402.32s -> 404.32s]  Alright, I'm redoing this.
[404.32s -> 406.32s]  It looks like alien, okay?
[406.32s -> 410.32s]  It looks like alien from the movie Alien, except he's green.
[410.32s -> 412.32s]  Well, I guess Prey Mantis kinda looks like an alien, doesn't he?
[412.32s -> 415.71s]  No, like the alien.
[415.71s -> 418.46s]  Oh.
[418.46s -> 421.86s]  God, this is so awful.
[421.86s -> 425.50s]  Five minutes have gone by.
[425.50s -> 429.71s]  Alright, I got...
[429.71s -> 431.71s]  I'm getting pretty good on the wings right here.
[431.71s -> 433.71s]  We're doing pretty good.
[433.71s -> 435.71s]  Alright, there's his head.
[435.71s -> 437.71s]  Oh my god.
[437.71s -> 439.71s]  Hi, I'm preying mantis.
[439.71s -> 441.95s]  Are you guys making Squidward over there?
[441.95s -> 443.95s]  Yes.
[443.95s -> 445.95s]  He looks like...
[445.95s -> 447.95s]  Oh my god.
[447.95s -> 449.95s]  This is the worst preying mantis.
[449.95s -> 451.95s]  We don't have no time.
[451.95s -> 456.13s]  You have to look at it where it blocks out the rest of his body.
[456.13s -> 458.13s]  And it just looks hilarious.
[458.13s -> 460.30s]  Come over here where I am.
[460.30s -> 462.30s]  Where it blocks out the back of his body.
[462.30s -> 464.80s]  You can't even tell.
[464.80s -> 467.42s]  It looks like a stick figure, like a green alien.
[467.42s -> 469.42s]  Oh, he really does just look like an alien.
[469.42s -> 472.18s]  He looks like the self-proc alien.
[472.18s -> 476.18s]  Okay, his body needs to be not a complete atrocity.
[476.18s -> 481.68s]  This needs to be a little bit bigger or wider.
[481.68s -> 484.94s]  A little more thick.
[484.94s -> 486.94s]  Alright, six minutes have gone by.
[486.94s -> 488.94s]  Six minutes? Good grief, man.
[488.94s -> 491.25s]  It's good, we got him.
[491.25s -> 493.25s]  I made some wings, so that's cool.
[493.25s -> 495.86s]  I think.
[495.86s -> 497.86s]  Where are you going?
[497.86s -> 500.35s]  Oh no!
[500.35s -> 504.66s]  He's got the tiniest little legs.
[504.66s -> 506.66s]  These hands have to be like knives.
[506.66s -> 509.47s]  Okay, make them knives.
[509.47s -> 511.47s]  My Minecraft is so bad at...
[511.47s -> 514.67s]  My Minecraft is so bad at...
[514.67s -> 516.67s]  Now he has machine guns apparently.
[516.67s -> 519.04s]  What's the different colors?
[519.04s -> 521.04s]  You said he had to have knives.
[521.04s -> 523.04s]  So I made knives.
[523.04s -> 525.04s]  Alright, let's give this other one a knife too.
[525.04s -> 527.47s]  Oh yeah.
[527.47s -> 529.47s]  Don't mess with him, he's got like two Tommy guns.
[529.47s -> 531.97s]  Oh, okay, good idea.
[531.97s -> 534.34s]  Good, good, good.
[534.34s -> 536.34s]  Dude, these legs are too small.
[536.34s -> 538.64s]  Less than one minute.
[538.64s -> 540.94s]  When he was born.
[540.94s -> 544.08s]  We have less than one minute.
[544.08s -> 547.22s]  Look at his freaking head.
[547.22s -> 550.03s]  It really just looks like an alien.
[550.03s -> 552.78s]  Alright, wait 30 seconds.
[552.78s -> 555.02s]  30 seconds.
[555.02s -> 557.65s]  He can fly more with these wings.
[557.65s -> 562.26s]  Hold on, let's make him bigger.
[562.26s -> 564.26s]  Okay, here we go. His legs are a little bit more thick now.
[564.26s -> 567.26s]  He's so wise.
[567.26s -> 569.63s]  You guys are kind of...
[569.63s -> 571.63s]  He's a little lopsided.
[571.63s -> 573.63s]  15 seconds.
[573.63s -> 575.63s]  And one hand is like
[575.63s -> 577.63s]  extremely larger and thicker than the other.
[577.63s -> 579.63s]  10 seconds.
[579.63s -> 581.63s]  And then we combined two different things in the middle.
[581.63s -> 583.63s]  It doesn't even look like they're connected.
[583.63s -> 585.63s]  Three seconds, two, one.
[585.63s -> 588.06s]  That's it.
[588.06s -> 590.06s]  I put a torch on his face
[590.06s -> 592.06s]  to make it look like he was smoking something.
[592.06s -> 594.56s]  I don't know why.
[594.56s -> 596.56s]  A good thing we combined two things in the middle.
[596.56s -> 598.56s]  We made like an airplane
[598.56s -> 600.56s]  and then we combined it with this thing right here
[600.56s -> 602.93s]  and then an alien.
[602.93s -> 604.93s]  Somebody totally deleted my wings.
[604.93s -> 606.93s]  I added more wings.
[606.93s -> 608.93s]  Alright, can somebody come explain to me
[608.93s -> 611.87s]  what's going on over here?
[611.87s -> 613.87s]  What is going on? Why does he have like one hand
[613.87s -> 615.87s]  that's like...
[615.87s -> 619.18s]  This is most certainly not a praying mantis.
[619.18s -> 621.18s]  One hand has a darker colored knife
[621.18s -> 623.18s]  and has seen more battle
[623.18s -> 625.18s]  than the other apparently.
[625.18s -> 627.18s]  This is like, oh my god.
[627.18s -> 630.00s]  Come look at it from far away.
[630.00s -> 632.00s]  It is so bad from far away.
[632.00s -> 634.30s]  Up close, it's not that bad.
[634.30s -> 636.93s]  This is not a praying mantis.
[636.93s -> 638.93s]  It's like a dragon who just didn't make it.
[638.93s -> 640.93s]  Just like, I don't know.
[640.93s -> 643.36s]  The wings are like on his butt.
[645.36s -> 647.36s]  Oh man.
[647.36s -> 649.36s]  Yeah, we didn't like do enough.
[649.36s -> 651.36s]  This is like too long or we didn't like fill it in enough
[651.36s -> 653.36s]  like right here.
[653.36s -> 655.60s]  It's just like a lot of nothing.
[655.60s -> 657.60s]  Oh my god. Alright, well
[657.60s -> 660.03s]  thanks for watching guys
[660.03s -> 662.03s]  and we'll catch you guys all next time
[662.03s -> 664.03s]  and of course rate the thing
[664.03s -> 666.03s]  and give it a name if you want to give it a name
[666.03s -> 668.03s]  and we'll see you all next time. Take care everybody.
[668.03s -> 674.93s]  Boo!
[677.86s -> 682.41s]  What? What just happened there?
