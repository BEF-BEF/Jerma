[0.31s -> 15.67s]  Hey, what is going on guys? Jerma here with SCP-087. Now, if you don't know what this
[15.67s -> 21.35s]  game is, this is a freeware game. The link will be in the description. It's a horror
[21.35s -> 26.95s]  game, and apparently it's one of the scariest damn games ever made. Now, I don't do well
[26.95s -> 30.79s]  with these types of games, and as you can see, I'm down the first flight of stairs and I
[30.79s -> 35.64s]  already don't want to play. But I have to, and I figured it would be fun to have the
[35.64s -> 42.09s]  face cam there in case something crazy happens, which I know it will. So, let's get started.
[42.09s -> 48.18s]  And to try not to psych myself out while I do this, I'm going to give you the backstory
[48.18s -> 59.96s]  of the game. So, pretty much this game, I already don't want to do this. So, pretty much this game
[59.96s -> 65.64s]  was made in two days by a guy, some programming designer or something. He said he did it on
[65.64s -> 76.34s]  coffee breaks, and it's a stairway... Somebody's coming behind me right now, I don't want to look
[76.34s -> 84.26s]  up there. It's a stairway simulator game, where this is really all you do, and... God,
[84.26s -> 97.90s]  God damn it. Get me out of here. I can't stop moving now. I don't know how long... This could
[97.90s -> 122.26s]  last like less than three minutes, and I might just rage to quit. Damn it, I hate this. But you
[122.26s -> 132.38s]  go down a series of stairs over and over again, and that's the game. And the goal is to see how
[132.38s -> 137.30s]  far you can go down, how many stairs you can go down. I'm at floor number six, and I'm almost
[137.30s -> 145.61s]  ready to just quit this game. And it messes with you, too. I keep on repeating myself, probably,
[145.61s -> 151.51s]  but that's because I am terrified right now. I can't even play Resident Evil without having
[151.51s -> 168.97s]  somebody else in the room with me, let alone a game like this. Floor eight. You know what? I need
[168.97s -> 174.52s]  ten people in the room with me to all be hanging out, because this is me by myself with headphones
[174.52s -> 186.46s]  on. What the hell was that? Floor number nine. Wait, wasn't I already on? The stuff is getting
[186.46s -> 200.41s]  louder, too. That's the worst part about this. Stuff is getting just loud and horrible. See,
[200.41s -> 206.01s]  it's so much repetition that you're doing the same thing over and over again, and you know
[206.01s -> 222.49s]  at some point something horrible is going to happen. You just don't know when. So I'm going to...
[222.49s -> 227.35s]  If you hit escape, you end the game. Hitting escape ends it, and that's going to happen,
[227.35s -> 256.78s]  definitely. Nineteen. It's actually, it's really... Oh my God! You knew it was going to happen at
[256.78s -> 268.41s]  some point. You just didn't know when. I'm at floor 20. I'm done. Can't give up that easily.
[268.41s -> 284.68s]  This stuff is going to get much... I don't even want to go down. God... God... You bastard. You son
[284.68s -> 298.74s]  of a bitch. I don't think I'll be able to... I don't think I'll be able to go past 30. Somebody's
[298.74s -> 302.50s]  right there. That was something. What is that? Oh, it's the shadow. It's the shadow of the...
[304.02s -> 323.98s]  That's the first time I saw that. That is the first time. 27. See, the shadows are really
[323.98s -> 327.66s]  starting to mess with you now. The shadows are really starting to kick in and really start to
[327.66s -> 345.29s]  freak you out because I didn't notice them before. I can't even look at the screen. I can't. I
[345.29s -> 356.94s]  seriously can't look at the screen. My whole body hurts right now from what just happened.
[356.94s -> 377.66s]  What is that? That's a face. Oh my God! Okay. See you next time.
