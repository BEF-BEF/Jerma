[4.92s -> 12.23s]  All right, hi. Hello everybody. How's it going? How's your day?
[17.98s -> 26.57s]  A lot of stuff going on. About 15 minutes before, 20 minutes before, about to start the stream.
[27.37s -> 30.09s]  I had to make sure that Kim got to the doctor because she's not feeling well.
[30.97s -> 40.46s]  That was just popped up. I'm just coming off a few days of being disoriented from
[40.46s -> 48.34s]  having a procedure done to me and then we had to move Halo to tomorrow.
[49.54s -> 53.94s]  And then I had to talk to like a bunch of people. Today's been a busy, busy, busy day.
[58.84s -> 67.22s]  I almost read that out loud. It was really close for me to read that out loud.
[67.86s -> 82.31s]  Yeah, she's okay. How do I feel? Well, I've gotten a few answers and I'm not sure what
[82.31s -> 88.76s]  that means for these answers, but it means I have to keep going. I have to keep figuring stuff out.
[93.96s -> 108.14s]  But some of the things I thought were real are real. It's kind of a weird scenario. I have a
[108.14s -> 118.44s]  hernia. Let's just put it that way. I have a hiatal hernia and I might also have costochondritis,
[119.32s -> 123.96s]  which is inflammation in your ribs. Like my rib cage is like fucked up or something.
[125.93s -> 137.69s]  So, it's been a weird, it's been an interesting couple days. Let's put it that way. Am I all right?
[137.69s -> 142.34s]  Yeah, I'm fine. I'm doing all right. I'm fine. I got a hernia from laughing too hard. I don't think
[142.34s -> 157.26s]  so. I don't think that's how you get a hiatal hernia, but the harder I laugh, the more I'm in
[157.26s -> 173.69s]  pain. The hernia is just a hair ball in his stomach, but I still don't know exactly what's
[173.69s -> 180.34s]  going on. So, that was literally like two and a half, three days ago. So, hey, this is what's
[180.34s -> 184.34s]  going on. This might be something else going on. We're going to go talk to somebody else now.
[187.40s -> 199.30s]  The game board of figuring out medical issues is just, we move like two more spaces to the right.
[199.30s -> 208.36s]  You know, we rolled two and now, okay, when can we land on Park Place? Can I land on the boardwalk
[208.36s -> 215.64s]  yet? Like when do I pass a go? No, no, no. You landed on Baltic Avenue. That place sucks.
[216.84s -> 221.00s]  Yeah, I don't want Baltic Avenue. You're going to have to wait until next week. So,
[221.00s -> 231.54s]  you have to wait two weeks to go to take another turn. Oh, okay. Siri, don't, I'm not talking to
[231.54s -> 241.88s]  you, Siri. Get out of here. Don't record this, Siri. Don't record me. Anyways, I need to make
[241.88s -> 300.10s]  a tweet. All right, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Okay. Sorry, I'm like texting people
[300.10s -> 309.08s]  to this. This like, it's the busiest day of the fucking year, apparently. But we are today,
[310.20s -> 315.08s]  today is not even a stream. Let me just be very, very clear about this. I was going to go three
[315.08s -> 321.64s]  days in a row starting with Halo, but Halo had to get pushed to tomorrow. I think Joel was doing
[321.64s -> 326.68s]  something that he wanted to finish. So I was like, yeah, that's fine. Let's go. And then on Friday,
[326.68s -> 332.04s]  we're probably going to do that tools up game. So we're just doing four days in a row because
[332.04s -> 337.54s]  like I'm still, I'm back. I'm coming back. So we'll just do probably three, four straight days in a
[337.54s -> 347.46s]  row as of today and tomorrow. What that means is we get to play a game that I've wanted to play
[348.18s -> 355.30s]  and everyone hates for some reason. Hey, I hate this game. This game sucks. This game's stupid.
[355.30s -> 366.58s]  Don't play that game. Well, I already bought it. So I'm just going to, we're just going to hang out
[366.58s -> 373.85s]  for a little while. And this is, this is a stream that's not even a real stream. The real stream
[373.85s -> 380.46s]  starts tomorrow. This is the pre stream comeback stream. We're going to be playing. Of course,
[380.46s -> 399.67s]  I'm talking about hand simulator. This one's not canon. I saw one person say, yes, this is the,
[399.67s -> 408.09s]  this is the halo reach tomorrow waiting room. Yes, I'm aware. All right. So how hand simulator
[408.09s -> 418.31s]  works for those of you that don't know, you just use your hands. You get to play with fidget spinners.
[418.79s -> 430.44s]  That was cool. The milkmaid, Merry Christmas and horror. Are we gaming? No. Well, let's do the fidget
[430.44s -> 436.14s]  spinners. Let's get it out of the way. This might be really loud too. I have no idea. Is it going to
[436.14s -> 447.62s]  be loud? It's not loud at all. There's no audio. Help. A S D F space, bend certain fingers.
[448.66s -> 461.94s]  How do I do, uh, A S D F. Oh, F is okay. This is the surgeon simulator, but you just do regular,
[461.94s -> 472.41s]  like normal stuff. Why is this? So is there any audio? Okay. Bend all fingers, hands mode. Oh,
[472.41s -> 481.56s]  you switch hands. Space is run. Crouch. Why would there be a crouch? Okay. Right mouse button is
[481.56s -> 496.09s]  rotate. This is just surgeon simulator with two hands. He's going to get bored. All right. So
[496.89s -> 507.75s]  how do I go down? Rotate forearm. But how do you, how do I move my hand just down? Like how do I
[507.75s -> 524.58s]  move it down? Middle mouse button? No. Why am I locked in place? What's wrong with me? Left shift
[524.58s -> 529.56s]  is hands. Okay. Oh, there we go. All right. So what do I need to do? I need to pick up the fidget
[529.56s -> 544.12s]  spinner and spin it. Oh, it's the mouse wheel. All right. Shit. This was like funny fucking seven
[544.12s -> 551.58s]  years ago. God damn it. I know. I understand. I know this was funny back in like 2013,
[552.22s -> 562.02s]  but just imagine we're there again. How do I pick this up? What do you mean? No, it wasn't.
[563.22s -> 569.22s]  If this was not funny in 2013, why did every single person make a YouTube channel about this
[569.22s -> 588.04s]  exact video game? It was bait. Somebody thought it was funny. All right. Pull it up. I did. Wait,
[588.04s -> 596.39s]  I almost got it. How are you supposed to grab stuff? Is this like the part, is this the game?
[598.90s -> 611.80s]  All right. I got it. Did I win? What do I do with it now? I have to make it spin. How do I lock this
[611.80s -> 629.67s]  into place? Spin it. This is like wrist exercises. How do I get it to move forearm, rotate forearm,
[629.67s -> 641.43s]  bend all fingers? Left shift hands mode. Okay. There we go. I see. Pull this down here. How do
[641.43s -> 646.95s]  you even use a fidget spinner? I don't think I've ever used one. This is wacky. You guys wanted
[646.95s -> 658.30s]  wacky? Here it is. It's not quite wacky. This would be music too. Why is it no audio in this whole game?
[661.78s -> 675.26s]  This is tearing, it's not tearing fingers off. Oh shit. This is just, this is like wacky in quotes.
[675.26s -> 684.52s]  I, now I know what you guys are talking about. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I
[684.52s -> 692.62s]  at least have to get one of these done. I bought the fucking game. Play the multiplayer? Well,
[692.62s -> 698.60s]  I can't go into multiplayer until I know how this game, how the game works. All right. Put
[698.60s -> 708.49s]  the whole thing down. This game's $2? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll get it.
[711.29s -> 716.41s]  Is it $2? Dab with the fidget spinner.
[724.86s -> 728.78s]  I need to, how do you, okay. I need to be able to do this. I need to do this in real life first.
[730.38s -> 734.06s]  How do you pick shit up? I don't even know how, how you, how the person you do this.
[734.70s -> 741.08s]  Like you grab, like I just grab stuff. I don't like know how I just do it. It's like breathing.
[742.46s -> 747.11s]  So I need to like pick this up in real life before I can actually know how to do this.
[747.75s -> 755.61s]  You go down and use your thumb, right? What's the thumb? Thumb is space. So if it were me in
[755.61s -> 768.38s]  real life, I would go like this and I would do my thumb and my index finger, right? Yeah. Okay.
[769.18s -> 781.46s]  This is how you pick stuff up, right? Here we go. Hold on. I almost got it. Get it. Come on,
[781.46s -> 793.14s]  pick it up. That one's too hard to get. I'm going to get this one. So what's the point of the other
[793.14s -> 810.60s]  hand? All right. Go like this. Come on. Okay. I got it. Now how do I, I gotta get it to spin.
[811.32s -> 816.01s]  What is like a soundtrack? All right, hold on. Let me get it to spin.
[824.78s -> 831.88s]  I can't breathe. I can't breathe. It's so funny. Oh, I fucking dropped it.
[837.78s -> 844.89s]  Fuck. I actually didn't mean to do that. Wait, this one's bigger. Maybe I can pick up a picture
[845.37s -> 850.62s]  I've already tried. Actually, wait, I probably can do that. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[850.62s -> 859.45s]  I'm interested now. I wasn't interested until 10 seconds ago. Give me the pencil. How do you pick
[859.45s -> 867.74s]  up a pencil? No, no, no, no, no. Don't drop it. I'm right-handed. I should be using this.
[870.30s -> 881.86s]  You see, he's a fucking wacky Twitch personality. It's too hard to grab stuff. Okay. I got this.
[881.86s -> 892.15s]  Now I have to activate it, right? So let's activate it. What's the hand again? It's this one.
[892.79s -> 910.86s]  All right. Flick it down, right? Why is this not working? Flick it down. Flick it down. What the
[910.86s -> 925.78s]  fuck am I doing? This looks like it hurts. Is it actually, is it already activated? No, there's no
[925.78s -> 939.18s]  pen coming down. What about the thumb? Let's try the thumb. Space, right? All right, bring it up.
[939.74s -> 952.17s]  Bring it back like this. Grip it. And then, is this pen already activated? Oh, I mean, oh.
[952.73s -> 969.48s]  Nothing about me. Something about me. I can't, I can't. No, I have to put it like up in my face.
[970.12s -> 985.59s]  I actually kind of like this. So I don't, middle mouse button is look mode. Wait, hold on.
[986.15s -> 994.18s]  Can I freeze individual hands? All right. Click it down. Why is it not clicking it down?
[998.30s -> 1009.48s]  Am I stupid? Am I actually out of my mind or am I not doing this right? Both.
[1009.64s -> 1023.40s]  Don't, don't fuck come at me. Don't. I don't understand how this works. First of all,
[1023.40s -> 1029.98s]  this needs to go down. Act like a normal human and just put your hand down. And then this is how
[1029.98s -> 1040.86s]  I would leave you right on the desk. Okay. Now put this down here. Standard document. How do I
[1040.86s -> 1054.76s]  write? Wait, hold on. Let it go for a second. Middle mouse is look. All right. So shift hands.
[1055.32s -> 1067.02s]  So that's it. That is how you freeze. Okay. So if you want to freeze something, you have to hit
[1067.02s -> 1082.68s]  shift. So right now I need to, I gotta pick this back up. Just drop it. You're holding it like a
[1082.68s -> 1098.09s]  syringe. Yeah. Well, how the fuck am I supposed to do it? Is this even possible? Tell me now,
[1099.13s -> 1102.17s]  tell me, stop. I don't want to waste my time anymore. Is this possible to pick up the pen
[1102.17s -> 1136.09s]  and use it? Yes. Are you sure? Grab it. Grab it. Okay. I got it. Now I have to arc my hand up
[1142.57s -> 1154.06s]  like this. All right. Get it down there. Now, how do I do? Okay. Do I have to click this?
[1155.02s -> 1178.44s]  I actually have to click this down. You have to write funny. Yeah. But for me to write funny,
[1178.44s -> 1182.12s]  I need the pen to work and all these pens, you have to push these buttons down.
[1187.72s -> 1196.60s]  There's pressure there. Why is it not working? This should be working.
[1198.09s -> 1205.74s]  Is it ready to go? He doesn't know how to use a pen. This is how you use a pen. I know how to
[1205.74s -> 1213.85s]  use a pen. Look like this pen sucks. Okay. It needs it. Wait, stay right there.
[1228.41s -> 1253.50s]  Fuck. I almost got it. Come on. Just click for fuck's sake. Oh, please. I don't want to
[1254.55s -> 1263.43s]  just wait. I got to bring this over here closer, like up in my fucking face and put it up. So it's
[1263.43s -> 1274.58s]  like that. And then up into my face right there. Here we go. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[1276.74s -> 1292.28s]  What's wrong with this pen? What is wrong? What's wrong with the pen? Use your palm instead.
[1301.45s -> 1311.77s]  That's not going to work. Why am I handing the air? What am I doing?
[1317.72s -> 1321.96s]  This is going to drive me fucking crazy. You know what? Move this hand over here.
[1321.96s -> 1325.72s]  Your hands just move on their own slowly. See how it's like moving to the right.
[1327.10s -> 1336.65s]  Come here. No, you fucking dumb thing. Move it over here and up right there.
[1337.45s -> 1352.79s]  Okay. Now I have my index finger. I'm going to tilt this like that. Why is this so hard?
[1355.69s -> 1376.81s]  Why is this so hard to do? This fucking camera. And then down. And then we do an index finger
[1376.81s -> 1402.68s]  right here. I'm going to do a different strategy coming through here. This is not how hands work.
[1403.56s -> 1416.95s]  No, it's not. It's a mess. I'm currently on it. How much pressure needs to go on this thing
[1416.95s -> 1422.46s]  to fit through the clothes? Why is this thing made out of fucking cement? Why can't I just
[1423.10s -> 1439.90s]  push it down? It doesn't make any sense. All right. Already angry? Yeah. Because like,
[1439.90s -> 1454.84s]  what the fuck? It doesn't make any sense. And plus, all right, when I move my hand to the right,
[1454.84s -> 1463.53s]  it just immediately moves it. Look at this. Where are you going? Where is this hand going?
[1463.53s -> 1475.46s]  Do I have my controller plugged in moving up? Move to the right. Are you sure you didn't move
[1475.54s -> 1493.46s]  up to the left? This is a chill stream. It is. Tilt it this way. Like this. Stay right there.
[1493.46s -> 1529.56s]  Come on. Wait. Somebody help me here and tell me why I can't move these things. All right. You got
[1529.56s -> 1544.28s]  to tell me why the fuck that ain't moving. It doesn't click. What do you mean it doesn't click?
[1544.28s -> 1564.36s]  Sometimes it just doesn't work. Give me the pen. No, give me the fidget spinner. Give me the beer.
[1564.36s -> 1579.69s]  Give me the, I don't know. Give me something else. Fuck. Why can't I lean this way? Bring the other
[1579.69s -> 1586.86s]  hand over here. Oh, it's gone. I can't even reach that far. How am I supposed to get this?
[1589.00s -> 1597.72s]  My body actually can't go that far. How are you supposed to reach this stuff on this table?
[1601.03s -> 1617.14s]  Is there like a lean button? C? C doesn't do anything. Can I like move my body? I can't even.
[1620.39s -> 1642.78s]  Nope. Oh my God. I got it. I got it. I got it. I almost got it. All right. The mouse scroll
[1642.78s -> 1659.98s]  into clicking and holding. Like that ain't going to work. Let me try. I have to do at least one of
[1659.98s -> 1677.00s]  these fucking tasks. I don't care how stupid and shitty this is. I almost got it. Come on.
[1677.00s -> 1682.73s]  If it spins in the air once, it counts. I don't care. No, wait, hold on. I think I can grab it
[1682.73s -> 1697.43s]  out of the other with the other hand. Oh no. He doesn't like hand game. Is that, is that really
[1697.43s -> 1713.75s]  a big deal? If I don't like hand simulator, that can't be a big deal. It's not a big deal.
[1713.75s -> 1731.24s]  If I don't like hand simulator, just grab it. Get it. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1732.25s -> 1763.58s]  No, didn't work. Can you even fucking do anything? Are you having fun? No. Ow. Stop. Hey,
[1763.58s -> 1770.10s]  you know, I got a hernia. You can't make me laugh. I have a hernia now. If I could pick this up,
[1777.38s -> 1783.30s]  make him laugh. Make him laugh. All right. I, I almost feel like I want a different control
[1783.38s -> 1797.29s]  scheme for this. Mouse XY and scroll wheel is move forearm. Using the scroll, I wish I could
[1797.29s -> 1803.77s]  just make that like right click and move down. In VR, it's a one-to-one movement. I feel like if
[1803.77s -> 1807.29s]  you did this in VR, everything would just be really easy. You just pick it up with your hands.
[1810.30s -> 1830.68s]  You just pick it up. Got it. I don't even know what buttons I'm holding. I don't know what buttons
[1830.68s -> 1862.52s]  I'm holding. Spin it. Quiet. That counts. That counts. That counts. I got it. It counts. It counts.
[1863.58s -> 1872.76s]  See? This would be real sad if you saw somebody doing this. Resident sleeper pog.
[1874.28s -> 1893.69s]  All right. Beat this one. Let's do another one. That took 30 minutes. Holy shit. Time flies when
[1893.69s -> 1900.36s]  you fucking hate the game you're playing. All right. How about, uh, let me see if I can fix
[1900.36s -> 1913.70s]  this though. No. All right. I did it. All right. What's the other ones? Milkmaid. All right. Now
[1913.70s -> 1943.59s]  we have all of a sudden audio. What is this? Cow? It's a cow. It's a cow. All right. Do I do
[1943.59s -> 1970.86s]  the other hand? So this one was, this is it. Punch the cow. Band that person. Get that person out
[1970.86s -> 1995.91s]  of here. I just had it too. I already did it. I did it. I can do the next one. It slipped. All
[1995.91s -> 2011.96s]  right. I win. I'm watching this in between classes. I'm milking a cow. This is a fucking cow.
[2012.52s -> 2030.09s]  All right. I got enough milk. I got enough. I got enough. Uh, what is horror? What the fuck is this?
[2030.09s -> 2047.22s]  Okay. You use WASD in this one. How do I control my hands? Am I gonna, am I gonna die?
[2051.42s -> 2055.34s]  Okay. That was, that was just, they were just there in the room.
[2061.51s -> 2069.78s]  Are you, they're slowly walking? Do I have to kill this person? All right. We're gonna use the
[2069.78s -> 2083.74s]  candle. No we're not. We're gonna use, um, there goes all my light. But why does your hand float
[2083.74s -> 2091.56s]  back up? I don't understand. When you put your hand down, it just comes back up. Down, up, down,
[2091.56s -> 2104.25s]  up. Stay down. That's how hands work. No, if I put my hand down, it's not gonna float up.
[2106.44s -> 2130.39s]  I'm not on a bunch of drugs. Hurry up. I'm trying. Punch her. I don't think you can punch.
[2131.27s -> 2148.82s]  All right. I'll try punching her. Come on Moe. What are you crazy?
[2149.22s -> 2179.90s]  Oh jeez. This looks like I'm just arguing. Why is she not walking any closer? I'm just like
[2179.90s -> 2223.90s]  pointing. Is it working? I think I'm pushing her. Um, is this working? Hold on. Oh, well that one
[2223.90s -> 2241.61s]  sucks. How about shooting range? Choose a weapon. All right. How about, um, zero? This is gonna be
[2241.61s -> 2262.46s]  impossible. This will be actually impossible. Maybe not. All right. Stay there. All right.
[2262.46s -> 2280.82s]  Keep it right there. Right. Which way does it go in? Like this. Yep. Don't drop it. Don't drop it.
[2280.82s -> 2294.55s]  Don't drop it. Don't drop it. Come back up. No. Other way. Oh man. This is not gonna work.
[2295.27s -> 2305.80s]  It has to be probably exact too. No. Pick it back up. It's not gonna work. Pick it back up.
[2307.35s -> 2311.35s]  All right. I have to come at this from a completely different angle.
[2317.69s -> 2339.11s]  Fucking mouse scroll. It like hurts my finger to do this this much. Get it over here. What the
[2339.11s -> 2346.66s]  fuck? Dude, imagine having mouse scroll be anything other than slide around a menu
[2346.66s -> 2372.78s]  in any video game ever made. What just happened? I caught it. How did I catch that? All right. I
[2372.78s -> 2376.78s]  gotta slow down. All right. That's not, that's not bad. That's not bad. Freeze it there.
[2378.36s -> 2381.96s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh my fucking god damn it. Give me a break.
[2386.17s -> 2401.51s]  Do gun second. Not first. Please. Is there a way to rotate my wrist? Like that? Yeah. Do it again.
[2411.67s -> 2431.96s]  Fucking damn it, man. Why does this have to keep happening? Oh, it's killing me. You know when
[2431.96s -> 2439.45s]  you're in a really bad fucking dream and you just want to wake up but you can't? You have to fucking
[2439.45s -> 2446.79s]  pick up the clip. This is a bad, this is not even hand simulator. This is a, this is bad dream.
[2447.75s -> 2453.30s]  The game. I feel like I'm moving the same way that I move when I'm in a dream.
[2453.94s -> 2467.58s]  Got it. Now turn this way. Please. What are you doing? All right. Now give me the gun.
[2467.58s -> 2478.44s]  I'm not even, I'm right handed though. Wait. I'm up this way. Like that. All right. Almost there.
[2480.46s -> 2502.50s]  Almost there. Don't fucking move. Eat the bullets. Oh my fucking god. Why? This is,
[2505.35s -> 2514.26s]  you guys remember QWOP? Okay. Imagine if QWOP had 15 more buttons. Now it's upside down.
[2514.82s -> 2542.14s]  Just read fucking fresh shit again. Stop. Just get it. Play QWOP instead. I know. I know. I
[2542.14s -> 2547.66s]  feel the same way as you. All right. Can we just be very clear? I feel the exact same way,
[2547.66s -> 2557.78s]  but I can't, I have to do, I have to do this. I feel identical to your feelings. We are the same
[2557.78s -> 2565.30s]  right now, but I have to do something. I have to do this. I have to get the guy in the dream.
[2570.62s -> 2582.95s]  Don't move that hand. Just play QWOP. No, I'm not going to play QWOP. QWOP. You guys want to talk
[2582.95s -> 2592.34s]  about old YouTube shit? QWOP is the boomer of these LOL. It's hard to control games.
[2593.34s -> 2605.83s]  And you guys hate boomers. Don't, huh? I'm getting angry. Don't it's going to fall off the fucking
[2605.83s -> 2617.62s]  table. No, it's not. I got it. QWOP is a zoomer. No, it's not. It's, it is the boomer of these
[2617.62s -> 2627.62s]  types of games. Okay. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't
[2627.62s -> 2635.27s]  let go. What do I do? Don't let go. I have to use, I have to hit the mouse scroll, but I can't,
[2635.27s -> 2657.38s]  I can't reach it. No, I have to grab this at a better angle. Fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2657.38s -> 2669.40s]  don't, don't, don't. This is going to be such a miserable experience. All right. Stop. Why does
[2669.40s -> 2679.40s]  it have to do that? Why does it do that? Why does it do that? You have to hold the thing. And then
[2679.40s -> 2686.25s]  when you switch, you're holding the wrong stuff. Make sure you spam mouse scroll down to be able
[2686.25s -> 2691.93s]  to even have your hand. Remember when you put your hand down, you, I've made out of fucking air. Why
[2691.93s -> 2706.18s]  would you ever make it that button for any reason? Literally make it, I make it controlled with my
[2706.18s -> 2728.63s]  tongue. It'd be easy to do. All right. See right now I have to hold all the things that I was
[2728.63s -> 2759.75s]  currently holding before. All right. Let's try it. It's weight. The weight is going down. Oh,
[2759.75s -> 2784.55s]  this sucks. This sucks. Get in there, please. I have to beat my nightmare. Oh,
[2786.92s -> 2794.95s]  oh, my whole body is fucking hurting right now. I hate it, but I can't, I have to have to do it.
[2794.95s -> 2803.98s]  I hate this. You know, you sit down to write a paper for college or for high school, doesn't
[2803.98s -> 2810.22s]  matter. And you, you hate, you, you write one sentence and you just go like, Oh, I fucking hate
[2810.22s -> 2815.50s]  this. And you like stand up, like move around. You're like, God damn it. I fucking hate this.
[2816.14s -> 2822.12s]  Then you know, you have to do it. This is, I feel the same exact way. I have to do this.
[2831.11s -> 2843.00s]  All right. I might be able to, what if I keep this right here? Tilt wrist down. It's almost there.
[2843.00s -> 2854.78s]  It's almost there. It's almost there. It's almost there. Look at this shit. Does it actually have
[2854.78s -> 2872.30s]  to be exact? No, it fucking doesn't. No, it doesn't. Why does it need to be exact? This is
[2872.30s -> 2884.46s]  a video game. Nothing's exact. You have to do it with one eye closed. Did somebody even just say
[2884.46s -> 2892.63s]  that or am I making that up? All right. It's not, it's not in the right place. This needs to be up
[2892.63s -> 2961.32s]  like this. Uh, don't, don't. Oh, if I feel like it's, Oh, no, no, just go in there. Get in there.
[2961.32s -> 2975.59s]  Get the fuck in here. Is it in? No, no, it's not. Dude, this is not hard to do this. This is not
[2975.59s -> 3005.48s]  hard to get this in here. Don't force it. It's not fucking possible. It's not possible. This is not
[3006.12s -> 3014.65s]  is not fucking possible. Where's my hand? Where am I going? What are you doing? What's it doing?
[3014.65s -> 3029.48s]  I'm not touching anything. You see in this shit. I'm not touching anything. Why is it? What is it
[3029.48s -> 3035.11s]  doing? All right. I would like to bring my arm down, please. Let go. You sure you don't want to
[3035.11s -> 3041.93s]  push it forward? That's not what I wanted you to do. Why are you like phantom moving? This is,
[3041.93s -> 3048.46s]  I don't know. What the fuck? All right. I'm going to try something else. Put the, put the gun down.
[3050.55s -> 3064.94s]  I want to try to get underneath it. Okay. Then down. This is absolutely not going to work.
[3066.34s -> 3086.78s]  Without a single doubt in my mind. There's no way this works. All right. I have to at least get it
[3086.78s -> 3098.18s]  in here. Maybe it'll be easier if I go this way. All right. I'm going to try this. It just doesn't
[3098.18s -> 3108.55s]  go the way it doesn't go where you want it to go. Stay right here. Move forward. Don't fucking move.
[3109.11s -> 3123.26s]  You're moving. Why are you moving? You shouldn't be. Which way does it go in? Which way does it go
[3123.26s -> 3153.11s]  in? Like this? I don't know. Would you like to move left? No, move right. Why is it fighting me to
[3153.11s -> 3160.57s]  move left? Dude, this shit is fighting me. Move left. No, move this way. Move left. No, you want
[3160.57s -> 3164.01s]  to move this way. Move left. No, move that way. What are you doing? Why is it a rubber band?
[3164.81s -> 3173.51s]  Why the fuck is it a rubber band? I just move here and stop. Move mouse left. Move mouse right.
[3173.51s -> 3177.11s]  No, what are you doing? You don't want to move mouse right? No, I want you to stay here.
[3177.11s -> 3222.09s]  It's not. It's not going to work. God. Why is my arm just broken? Why do you have to hold it like
[3222.09s -> 3228.28s]  this? I have a better idea. I have to hold the gun in a different spot. I have to hold the gun
[3228.28s -> 3246.73s]  with two hands. Yeah, fuck this. Give me this thing. Fucking mouse scroll. Imagine having mouse
[3246.73s -> 3251.82s]  scroll. Imagine it. Just imagine mouse scroll. I just want you to picture it in your head.
[3258.97s -> 3272.70s]  All right. Move it this way. No, I just want to imagine. Imagine. Oh, God. Pain in the ass.
[3273.34s -> 3293.51s]  This is great. All right. Now, wait. I just want to tilt it down. Why is it so hard to
[3293.51s -> 3308.44s]  even rotate your wrist? It's just all fucked up. No, I ain't going to be able to do that.
[3316.62s -> 3320.38s]  This guy at the gun range, it's like, no, you're doing that real wrong.
[3324.79s -> 3358.82s]  You know what? I have a better idea. Am I going the right way? This is painful to watch. This is
[3358.82s -> 3377.26s]  painful to play. So I agree with you. It sucks. But I have to try. No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
[3377.26s -> 3383.32s]  This is the opportunity. Why are you naked at a gun range? I don't know. Because I don't know the
[3383.32s -> 3399.14s]  lore. Okay. Hold on. My initial plan might work pretty well here. My hand needs to go down like
[3399.14s -> 3409.96s]  that. All right. Everybody hold your breath for a second. Beautiful. Hold it in place. Let go of
[3409.96s -> 3421.69s]  this. Oh, fuck. Yeah. All right. Now hold on. Now I just need to put this in the right spot.
[3422.87s -> 3429.94s]  Up and like over here. Okay. You can breathe now. Yeah. Take a nice deep breath out. And then
[3429.94s -> 3441.75s]  this needs to be perfectly straight. Just go to the left. If I move to the right, he moves to the
[3441.75s -> 3455.38s]  right. If I tilt to the left, he moves to the right. What are you doing? Like move your fucking
[3455.38s -> 3481.19s]  hand. I hate this game. This is the worst game of the decade. I can't even bend my wrist. It's
[3481.19s -> 3501.74s]  the weight of the gun. Oh, please. I can't even get the thing to stay straight. Come back over
[3501.74s -> 3516.20s]  here. Try a grenade. No, I'm not quitting. I'm not quitting yet. Just because you say a game is the
[3516.20s -> 3524.36s]  worst game of the decade doesn't mean that you're not going to try to win. Give me my other hand.
[3533.67s -> 3549.91s]  Wait, that's not a bad spot. Where's the clip? All right. Get it over here. I have to spin this
[3549.91s -> 3563.40s]  around. You have to throw a grenade. I'm not done yet. I need to move this in a circle with like
[3563.40s -> 3570.65s]  my thumb. Just don't knock it off the fucking table. All right. So that's going to be going
[3570.65s -> 3588.12s]  the right way, right? Keep spinning it. Let it go. It needs to go. All right. So shoe out,
[3588.12s -> 3599.22s]  right? Forward shoe out. Is that correct? Like the toe of the shoe here. It goes out. Tab forward.
[3599.22s -> 3624.86s]  Right. Okay. All right. Cool. So I have to do spin this. Don't fall off the fucking table, please.
[3625.58s -> 3637.27s]  All right. Almost there. All right. Tab is almost going to be facing out. Just going to grab it
[3637.27s -> 3644.66s]  from. I can't, I have to make sure I grab it from the bottom. I got to close all my fingers
[3645.22s -> 3675.00s]  completely. And then cause it'll get stuck. All right. Tab is now facing out. Hold on. I
[3675.00s -> 3679.40s]  should be able to let it go from here and it won't fall off the table, but it'll be in the
[3679.40s -> 3682.52s]  right. Oh my fucking God. Don't fall off the table. Don't fall off the table. Don't do it.
[3682.52s -> 3688.39s]  Jesus Christ. Oh fuck. Okay. Hold on. This is important.
[3703.51s -> 3705.99s]  It's going to fall off the table. It's going to fall. I have to use the gun.
[3716.17s -> 3734.66s]  I actually am naked. You're right. That is weird. All right. Wait, flip it again. Now it's almost
[3734.74s -> 3748.92s]  there. Why can't I just tilt the gun to the left? There's like an invisible wall here where I can't
[3748.92s -> 3775.30s]  move the gun this way. I can go literally every single other direction. Fuck you. No, not you.
[3775.30s -> 3797.80s]  You. Me? No. Yes. Not yes. Not yes. This. Why is my pinky not closed? Oh my, I don't understand why
[3797.80s -> 3805.18s]  I don't get it. I can go every other direction. The gun is apparently too heavy for me to hold
[3805.18s -> 3819.46s]  in one hand. Is this the new Mario Tennis? No, because everybody likes Mario Tennis.
[3821.72s -> 3838.58s]  That's different. That's a different scenario. Except for me. I like Mario Tennis. I don't like,
[3838.58s -> 3850.12s]  I don't actually like Mario Tennis. I just have to say that. Again, let me just maybe be very
[3850.12s -> 3858.18s]  clear about this. Move character's arm to the right. No. Go that way instead. Move character's
[3858.18s -> 3864.12s]  arm in. No, just go that way. I don't have any actual precise control of my character.
[3864.76s -> 3892.50s]  Sometimes he just, just bounces. It's over. Zero progress. Point and laugh. Yeah,
[3893.22s -> 3923.24s]  I'll give you a laugh. Such a fucking mess. What a mess. I know, look, I know this is what the
[3923.24s -> 3936.44s]  game's point is. I understand. I know. I know the point of the game is for this scenario. This is
[3936.44s -> 3945.69s]  what everybody likes and everybody wants to see. It was made for this scenario. This one. This is
[3945.69s -> 3949.21s]  what you wanted to see. This is what everybody plays this game for. No one wanted to see that.
[3949.21s -> 3956.34s]  That's right. Fuck, you're right. No one wanted to see this. Shit. Yeah, nobody wanted to see this.
[3956.34s -> 3959.78s]  Everybody said, don't play this. This game's terrible. And I was like, oh no, I want to do it.
[3959.78s -> 3964.84s]  Yeah, I get it. You're right. Nevermind. Shit, I was wrong. I'm sorry. I was about to go off
[3964.84s -> 3969.24s]  like a tangent about what you wanted to see and nobody wanted to see this.
[3973.82s -> 3980.14s]  I'm like painting a pretend fucking narrative. This is what you guys said. This is what you guys
[3980.14s -> 3992.52s]  wanted. No, no, we didn't. Oh, right. What I meant to say was here's the fucking worst thing though.
[3992.52s -> 4021.18s]  I like need to see this. I have to do this. I can't open this and then not do it because then I'll
[4021.18s -> 4028.06s]  never live this down, you know? I'll be the one moron that opened this game and went, no,
[4028.06s -> 4032.46s]  I don't, this is dumb. And then, no, no, no, I have to do it. I have to at least load the gun.
[4032.46s -> 4065.93s]  I have to load the gun. I have to load the gun. Wait a minute. Will this work? No, I didn't pick
[4065.93s -> 4072.47s]  it up. Great. Yeah, didn't pick it up. It didn't pick the fucking thing up. And now I'm on a
[4072.47s -> 4077.35s]  different view. This is fantastic. Oh, good. Do it again. No, no, do it again. No, do it again.
[4078.23s -> 4086.34s]  Okay, this time. No, you didn't get it. Okay, please. Spam mouse scroll. Now click. Did you get it?
[4086.98s -> 4094.73s]  No, sorry. Your hand floated four inches up for no reason. Spam mouse scroll. Click. I think I got
[4094.73s -> 4116.55s]  it. Did I get it? Oh, good. Got it this time. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's almost there.
[4116.55s -> 4149.56s]  It's almost there. Stop, stop. Stop. Can I save state? In there, please. How is it not going in?
[4150.76s -> 4161.88s]  What? Why is it going out? Why? Go in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4166.84s -> 4184.10s]  Go. Go. Go. Why? It's stuck. No, it's not. Wait, hold on. Move my thumb out of the way, maybe. No,
[4184.10s -> 4199.85s]  no, no, no, no. Turn the whole thing upside down. Stop. Okay. Turn the whole thing upside down.
[4199.85s -> 4207.96s]  Fuck. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go with your finger. Let go with your finger. Let go with
[4207.96s -> 4213.32s]  your finger. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Not yet. Don't. I'm crossing here. Should I let go of
[4213.32s -> 4230.78s]  my finger? Let go. Okay. Yeah. What did I say? Worst game of the decade? That's fucking harsh.
[4233.91s -> 4255.27s]  I got it. Now shoot it. Okay. Wait, wait, this been a bunch of subs that have come in. Okay. I got
[4255.27s -> 4285.43s]  it. Now I just have to shoot it. Get my finger in there. Oh, that scared the shit out of me. Okay.
[4285.43s -> 4288.47s]  That's how you shoot the gun. I shot it. All right. So I shot the gun. I did it.
[4295.91s -> 4299.03s]  I have to aim it. I have to hit the target and then I can play a different game. I'm not going
[4299.03s -> 4306.06s]  to play a different game. I'm like obsessed. Look, this is the extra stream this week. We already
[4306.06s -> 4312.34s]  talked about it. This four days in a row. This is the extra stream. This stream didn't even happen
[4312.34s -> 4333.14s]  today. You're all imagining things. You're dreaming things. You can't wake up from the dream. All right.
[4333.14s -> 4354.57s]  Let's go. All right. Now I can move my hands like this. Perfect. All right. The pinkie's got a thing.
[4354.57s -> 4370.07s]  Okay. Here we go. I'm trying. Okay. Why is it? Why am I dropping it? Why am I dropping it? Does
[4370.07s -> 4376.62s]  this gun weigh like 70 pounds? What are you doing? What are you doing? What the fuck is it doing?
[4377.26s -> 4426.07s]  Come here. Oh, don't do it. Don't shoot me. Okay. It can't shoot me now. Oh, it's freaking me out.
[4427.14s -> 4433.94s]  Don't drop the gun. I need to actually, I can, I can drop the gun over here. I'll try picking it
[4434.02s -> 4442.46s]  up one more time. Don't let it go. I'm not going to let it go. What's the next gun? I should try
[4442.46s -> 4446.44s]  the sniper rifle. There's no way I'm going to be able to do that without a single doubt in hell.
[4449.50s -> 4479.54s]  Jesus Christ. I have to at least get a shot fired over here. I'm trying. Don't drop the gun.
[4485.64s -> 4492.65s]  It's aiming at my stomach now. This is not good. Ooh, tilt.
[4493.53s -> 4507.42s]  I'm not gonna. I have to just put it back over here. Oh, it's in a bad spot.
[4509.19s -> 4513.83s]  I don't like this game. I really don't. It's like, it's seriously causing me a ton of anxiety right
[4513.83s -> 4543.02s]  now, but I can't stop. All right. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just give me the damn thing.
[4544.34s -> 4549.78s]  Chill stream. Oh, beg a lull. Whatever. I can hold it upside down. The gun still works upside down.
[4550.50s -> 4577.16s]  Pick it up. Grab it. Half-life Alex game play.
[4582.09s -> 4598.74s]  All right. Just aim it. Did I get one? All right. I shot him. Okay. I got it. Yep. Right over there.
[4598.74s -> 4618.01s]  I got two. One, two. Okay. Cool. What's the next thing? Why can I not use the, what do I mean?
[4619.05s -> 4632.12s]  I can't. Why can I spawn the other gun? You have to unlock the next one. You need points
[4632.76s -> 4637.99s]  to unlock the next one. I'm going to do this real quick.
[4640.87s -> 4646.07s]  Shit. Okay. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. No, no, no, don't do it! No! No!
[4646.07s -> 4649.75s]  Just hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on everybody. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.
[4649.75s -> 4669.78s]  But whatever. This is not even a real stream. Fuck. Just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it, re-do it.
[4669.78s -> 4685.96s]  I just realized this streamer is only in 720p. Oh no. What a disaster. I can't believe he's in
[4685.96s -> 4700.09s]  720p that sucks that's fucked up yeah 720 60 you guys know anything about bitrate
