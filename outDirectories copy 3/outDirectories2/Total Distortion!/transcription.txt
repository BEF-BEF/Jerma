[4.86s -> 8.46s]  So hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome to Total Distortion.
[8.46s -> 14.14s]  This is a game that just, you know, recently came out 20 years ago and...
[16.22s -> 18.86s]  This guy sure does talk a lot of shit. That's all I remember.
[21.58s -> 26.52s]  Let's go to bed. Falling asleep? That's okay.
[27.96s -> 32.12s]  The dreams are racing down the road. The winner will take over your mind.
[32.68s -> 36.12s]  Stop the bad dreams from entering your brain with the dream gun.
[36.92s -> 42.36s]  Okay. So my dream gun's on the right. I don't want that dream there. I seem to be...
[44.02s -> 46.02s]  Okay. Well, this is...
[54.90s -> 60.66s]  I'm like real fucked up right now. Son of a bitch.
[65.51s -> 72.57s]  It's hit me every single time. I didn't even get hit by that. It's bullshit. No.
[72.73s -> 76.58s]  Oh! Look at my metal face.
[78.90s -> 80.90s]  Can I cut? Can I counteract this?
[82.02s -> 85.06s]  Minus 46. Holy shit.
[87.35s -> 94.78s]  Index of books. Uh, there's a lot of books here.
[97.62s -> 99.86s]  Let's go. Let's go with Facebook book one.
[100.82s -> 103.86s]  That looks like a good book. I wonder what this is going to be about.
[103.86s -> 105.78s]  I wonder what tale this is going to tell me.
[107.62s -> 115.70s]  Oh, it's in fact not a book at all. It's just some guy.
[118.42s -> 125.06s]  Oh, this is a good book. I like the part where the princess revolts against the alien.
[131.27s -> 137.03s]  Sledgehammer Fists. Battle practice. That sounds like a pretty good book. It could be anything,
[137.03s -> 145.13s]  right? This is also not a book. How do I punch again?
[147.98s -> 153.30s]  Am I on the left or the right? I'm pretty sure I'm on the left, but I'm dead.
[154.10s -> 162.57s]  So the purpose of this whole game, from what I remember when I was like 12 years old,
[163.21s -> 168.12s]  is you have to make music videos with their crappy video editor,
[168.12s -> 170.20s]  and then you have to sell them to people on Earth.
[171.14s -> 177.94s]  Let's go ahead and have a car. That'll be the opening scene.
[177.94s -> 182.82s]  Yeah, we're going to have the second scene will be some cement because we need to be solidified.
[182.82s -> 186.58s]  We need to be set in stone. We need to make sure people know that we're like stonescaped.
[186.58s -> 192.66s]  And we'll have, I guess, I don't know, this car stretching like a clay car.
[192.66s -> 194.10s]  And then we're going to have guitars flying around.
[196.42s -> 201.22s]  Scene three will be pretty easy, too. So we'll have stones to show how solidified and how stone,
[201.22s -> 205.78s]  how rock solid we are. There's like a knife flying by, too.
[206.74s -> 210.36s]  All right, let's take a look at our music video that we've created.
[211.32s -> 229.96s]  Dogshit Burrito. Oh, man, that fucking sucked.
[231.98s -> 241.34s]  Hamburger bun, peanut butter, cream cheese. You know, I love mustard on my peanut butter
[241.34s -> 245.10s]  and cream cheese sandwiches. And you know, let's go a little strawberry jam.
[245.10s -> 246.54s]  That's good, too. Let's go ahead and make it.
[247.42s -> 256.84s]  You would have to pay me like at least 15 to 20 dollars to eat this sandwich.
[256.84s -> 260.62s]  I would not eat this for anything less than that, but we're going to see how it tastes.
[266.33s -> 276.34s]  This is going to be disgusting. Milk, hot sauce, and like Coca-Cola.
[278.79s -> 284.90s]  Oh, God. How is that good?
[289.59s -> 291.35s]  You want a lettuce sandwich?
[297.26s -> 301.06s]  Do not come any closer. You know what? Fuck it. Guitar fight.
[304.58s -> 307.46s]  Yeah, eat shit. We're going to be shooting guitar.
[310.38s -> 310.86s]  Did he serve?
[316.87s -> 317.67s]  That's bullshit.
[318.31s -> 319.91s]  Or I will destroy you.
[319.91s -> 323.03s]  No, fuck you. I'm going to kill you with my guitar.
[323.99s -> 328.63s]  I'm going to do you a C and then a B. Hit him. Hit him.
[331.90s -> 335.42s]  All right, so I spent some time in the video editor. I had a couple of sandwiches.
[335.42s -> 340.30s]  I had the blueberry and sardine sandwich and I started to feel a little bit more creative.
[340.30s -> 344.86s]  And I decided, you know what? I'm going to spend like three to four hours on making a new music
[344.86s -> 349.34s]  video, which I did. And here it is. How could you pass this up if you were a producer?
[349.34s -> 354.14s]  Let's go ahead and take a look. Should I bring the lights down, please? Okay. Enjoy.
[383.58s -> 384.78s]  Now we're cooking with gas.
[385.98s -> 388.86s]  All right, let's shop this thing around. Let's make a sale here.
[389.59s -> 394.07s]  Hi. I've called you before, but hello again, Stevie. Stevie Groovy.
[395.75s -> 399.11s]  Thank you very much. I think we can possibly, you know, send it to you right now.
[402.94s -> 407.24s]  Here you go. Please come on.
[407.64s -> 409.96s]  Thanks. I'll get back to you after I've taken a look at it.
[409.96s -> 411.24s]  Come on. You have to like this one.
[411.24s -> 414.20s]  I'll take that video. I'm not sure it's hit material.
[415.69s -> 419.93s]  What? What? Hold on. All right. She's going to take the video. I don't think I've ever
[419.93s -> 425.61s]  sold a video on this game before in my entire like 29 years on the planet. Hold on. Okay.
[425.61s -> 429.51s]  Like this. I can't. What's your offer? What are you going to give me for that?
[429.51s -> 430.55s]  Here's my offer.
[430.55s -> 440.50s]  10 million, 20 million, 500 bucks. That's it. I kind of want to pitch it around. I mean, if she,
[440.50s -> 445.29s]  if she'll take it for 500, maybe somebody else will take it for 600.
[447.77s -> 452.89s]  Hi. You don't know me, but I just want to say, how are you? We can, we can cut to the chase here.
[452.89s -> 457.53s]  I'm a big fan. Yeah. You know that I'm going to send you a music video right now and you let
[457.53s -> 462.33s]  me know if you like it. And if you have, you know, if you have more than 500 bucks on your hand,
[462.89s -> 468.33s]  then maybe you and I can, you know, work together. All right. Let's go see what he says.
[471.05s -> 478.36s]  I don't, I don't speak. I don't speak this. What are you saying? Did you just hung up on me?
[480.06s -> 484.06s]  Yeah. Stevie Groove send video to Stevie Groovy. I'll take the 500 bucks, please.
[484.06s -> 486.46s]  Thanks. I'll get back to you after I've taken a look at it.
[486.46s -> 490.70s]  Yeah. You've already seen it. Trust me. But I'm not sure it's hit material.
[490.70s -> 496.54s]  I know. I know it's not a hit. I'm aware of that right now, but just give me the money. Thank you.
[496.54s -> 508.76s]  I will take it. She dropped her offer by $200. You tell me I've been spending $50 per call.
[509.24s -> 514.68s]  This past like 15 minutes, just jumping around, shopping around my video. I've dropped like $500
[514.68s -> 519.48s]  and collect calls to people. The $300 fucking dollars she just gave me won't even cover the
[519.48s -> 524.60s]  cost of these phone calls. How am I supposed to break even? You know, in this, in this economy,
[524.60s -> 536.65s]  how am I supposed to break even in this economy? You were hot. Guess what? You're not.
