[0.31s -> 13.50s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Special Forces Team X.
[13.50s -> 17.50s]  Kind of a weird name, I know, but bear with me here, just in the first minute or so.
[17.50s -> 21.50s]  I'm gonna do an introduction. This is a live commentary with my buddy Ari.
[21.50s -> 27.50s]  Just got this game last week. It just came out last week, actually, just about seven or eight days ago.
[27.50s -> 30.50s]  And there's not a whole lot of press on this game, which is very odd,
[30.50s -> 34.50s]  because it's made by the same people, Zombie Studios, that created Blacklight.
[34.50s -> 38.50s]  If you play Blacklight Retribution, a lot of this is gonna be very familiar to you.
[38.50s -> 43.50s]  A lot of the gun sounds, a lot of the menu screens are pretty much identical to Blacklight.
[43.50s -> 47.50s]  But anyway, this is not a free-to-play game. This is a $15 game on Steam right now.
[47.50s -> 51.50s]  And I highly suggest you play it, because it's a third-person shooter, mash-up,
[51.50s -> 57.50s]  kind of like TF2 and Gears of War had a baby, and they brought the dogs over from Black Ops.
[57.50s -> 60.50s]  Like, that's what you're going to get when you play this game, as weird as that sounds.
[60.50s -> 64.50s]  But just wanted to give a quick introduction. The live commentary is going to kick in here now.
[64.50s -> 67.50s]  So I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care, everybody.
[99.47s -> 100.47s]  Alright, I'm gonna sneak up.
[101.47s -> 102.47s]  I think he's up top.
[102.47s -> 103.47s]  I don't know where he is.
[103.47s -> 104.47s]  Got him.
[104.47s -> 105.47s]  Nice job.
[105.47s -> 107.42s]  Can't go down.
[107.42s -> 111.22s]  Let's get this cap.
[111.22s -> 112.22s]  Nice.
[112.22s -> 113.39s]  Beautiful.
[113.39s -> 115.40s]  Perfect.
[115.40s -> 119.46s]  Oh, shit.
[119.46s -> 121.46s]  Yeah, my hard drive failed last week.
[121.46s -> 122.46s]  Really?
[122.46s -> 126.46s]  My main 1TB hard drive. I lost absolutely everything.
[126.46s -> 128.46s]  Couldn't recover a single thing from it.
[128.46s -> 130.46s]  Oh my god!
[130.46s -> 135.36s]  I lost a shit ton of music.
[135.36s -> 136.36s]  That's the worst.
[136.36s -> 137.36s]  Yeah.
[137.36s -> 138.36s]  Doggy!
[138.36s -> 139.36s]  Doggy!
[139.36s -> 140.36s]  I'm sorry.
[140.36s -> 141.36s]  I love dogs.
[141.36s -> 144.36s]  The weird thing is, it kind of looks like Otto.
[144.36s -> 146.36s]  I know.
[146.36s -> 147.36s]  You know what?
[147.36s -> 149.36s]  I'll say this right here, right now.
[149.36s -> 152.60s]  I don't like games where you like...
[152.60s -> 157.60s]  For instance, if I don't shoot the hell out of that dog, I'm gonna die.
[157.60s -> 158.60s]  I don't know.
[158.60s -> 160.84s]  I hate shooting animals in games.
[160.84s -> 161.84s]  Oh, airstrike inbound.
[161.84s -> 165.26s]  Shit.
[165.26s -> 166.26s]  What the hell?
[166.26s -> 167.26s]  That guy's not dead?
[167.26s -> 168.26s]  He got assassinated.
[168.26s -> 169.26s]  He's now.
[169.26s -> 170.75s]  Give me a sec.
[170.75s -> 173.53s]  It's alright.
[173.53s -> 174.53s]  Changing mags.
[174.53s -> 175.53s]  What do we need?
[175.53s -> 176.53s]  A, getting captured?
[176.53s -> 180.26s]  Oh, we got all three, huh?
[180.26s -> 182.59s]  Oh, B.
[182.59s -> 184.73s]  Let's B it up.
[184.73s -> 186.93s]  Sorry.
[186.93s -> 187.93s]  Sorry.
[187.93s -> 190.23s]  That hard drive just came back from...
[190.23s -> 192.23s]  I had it under warranty, thankfully.
[192.23s -> 195.37s]  That's a good thing, at least.
[195.37s -> 197.67s]  Oh, beautiful teamwork.
[197.67s -> 198.67s]  Beautiful.
[198.67s -> 199.67s]  That was beautiful.
[199.67s -> 201.67s]  Can you tell the difference?
[201.67s -> 203.67s]  You can't tell we're halfway across the world from each other?
[203.67s -> 205.67s]  I don't know, really.
[205.67s -> 207.67s]  It's like we're in the same room.
[207.67s -> 209.67s]  Yeah, there's a guy right here.
[209.67s -> 211.67s]  I think he's wrapping around.
[211.67s -> 212.67s]  Nice job.
[212.67s -> 214.62s]  Beautiful.
[214.62s -> 216.62s]  One guy at the back as well, behind the truck.
[216.62s -> 219.05s]  Oh, little dogs.
[219.05s -> 220.22s]  Oh, I'd have gotten murdered.
[220.22s -> 221.85s]  How did he...
[221.85s -> 222.85s]  Wow.
[222.85s -> 223.85s]  How the hell did he kill me from back there?
[223.85s -> 228.84s]  That guy just annihilated me.
[228.84s -> 231.36s]  Oh, he's dead.
[231.36s -> 234.97s]  Oh, it's alright.
[234.97s -> 236.97s]  I'm right here with you.
[236.97s -> 239.96s]  Can I climb over that?
[239.96s -> 240.96s]  Oh, there's a guy coming over here.
[240.96s -> 243.86s]  I'll gas him around the side.
[243.86s -> 247.34s]  He's gonna blow...
[247.34s -> 248.34s]  Oh, no.
[248.34s -> 249.34s]  Did I...
[249.34s -> 250.34s]  No, you need health.
[250.34s -> 251.34s]  Did I just...
[251.34s -> 253.34s]  No, I didn't kill him.
[253.34s -> 255.34s]  Dude, I just blew my own teammate up.
[255.34s -> 257.84s]  Oh, I'm such an idiot.
[257.84s -> 260.91s]  I just blew my own teammate straight to hell.
[260.91s -> 262.91s]  Killed the guy with the minigun.
[262.91s -> 263.91s]  What?
[263.91s -> 266.18s]  What?
[266.18s -> 267.93s]  What the hell was that?
[267.93s -> 269.94s]  That guy teleport-slided.
[269.94s -> 275.06s]  What a bastard.
[275.06s -> 277.38s]  A bunch at A.
[277.38s -> 279.38s]  There's a ton of them at A.
[279.38s -> 280.38s]  Oh, you're in trouble.
[280.38s -> 282.69s]  Is that you right there?
[282.69s -> 283.69s]  Oh, I'm coming.
[283.69s -> 284.69s]  I'm coming.
[284.69s -> 286.57s]  I'm coming.
[286.57s -> 289.11s]  Oh, lord.
[289.11s -> 290.11s]  Wow.
[290.11s -> 293.89s]  I tried to get on you, but...
[293.89s -> 294.89s]  There's a...
[294.89s -> 295.89s]  There's a lot over here.
[295.89s -> 297.77s]  ...because you're in action.
[297.77s -> 298.77s]  Oh, give me that headshot.
[298.77s -> 300.65s]  Come on.
[300.65s -> 302.65s]  Oh, what are you using, by the way, guns-wise?
[302.65s -> 303.65s]  Just, I think, the default.
[303.65s -> 305.72s]  Whatever the default was.
[305.72s -> 307.41s]  Are they still at A?
[307.41s -> 308.41s]  I see one guy.
[308.41s -> 313.17s]  Ace.
[313.17s -> 316.52s]  Boink.
[316.52s -> 319.55s]  I'm gonna win this one, I think.
[319.55s -> 320.55s]  Oh, too easy.
[320.55s -> 321.86s]  Oh, yeah.
[321.86s -> 322.86s]  Guy on the roof.
[322.86s -> 325.82s]  Yeah.
[325.82s -> 326.82s]  Yeah.
[326.82s -> 327.82s]  He's over here.
[327.82s -> 328.82s]  Oh, he's got a face.
[328.82s -> 329.82s]  Samuel.
[329.82s -> 330.82s]  There he is.
[330.82s -> 333.32s]  Come on, show yourself again.
[333.32s -> 334.50s]  Show yourself again.
[334.50s -> 335.93s]  Come on.
[335.93s -> 336.93s]  No.
[336.93s -> 337.93s]  You know you want to pop out of there.
[337.93s -> 339.23s]  I double dare you.
[339.23s -> 340.23s]  Oh, this guy.
[340.23s -> 341.23s]  Oh, a bunch coming.
[341.23s -> 342.23s]  Bunch coming.
[342.23s -> 345.14s]  Whoa.
[345.14s -> 346.14s]  I'm, like, doing flips.
[346.14s -> 347.14s]  Yikes.
[347.14s -> 348.14s]  There are a couple of A.
[348.14s -> 349.38s]  There's a couple coming to C.
[349.38s -> 350.38s]  There's a lot coming to C.
[350.38s -> 354.66s]  See, I was too busy, like, aiming at the guy across the map, and two guys came, like,
[354.66s -> 357.43s]  underneath the stairs today.
[357.43s -> 358.43s]  It's a pretty open situation.
[358.43s -> 359.43s]  Like, I quite...
[359.43s -> 360.67s]  Yeah.
[360.67s -> 361.67s]  I like how the maps are designed.
[361.67s -> 362.85s]  There are multiple entry points.
[362.85s -> 366.86s]  No one can complain about getting camped.
[366.86s -> 367.86s]  Yeah, it's definitely fun.
[367.86s -> 369.86s]  A lot of fun.
[370.10s -> 372.10s]  You can get a team of, like...
[372.10s -> 375.10s]  Anything between, like, two and, like, five people is incredible.
[375.10s -> 376.41s]  What's the cap?
[376.41s -> 377.41s]  What's the cap of people playing?
[377.41s -> 378.78s]  What do you mean?
[378.78s -> 379.78s]  Like, how many people per...
[379.78s -> 380.78s]  Can you have in each game?
[380.78s -> 381.78s]  Like, 10 out of 10?
[381.78s -> 382.78s]  I think 16.
[382.78s -> 383.78s]  I think 16.
[383.78s -> 384.78s]  Seven.
[384.78s -> 385.78s]  Ah, 16.
[385.78s -> 386.78s]  Okay.
[386.78s -> 387.78s]  Eight.
[387.78s -> 388.78s]  Yeah, eight on each.
[388.78s -> 390.34s]  God.
[390.34s -> 391.34s]  Maths.
[391.34s -> 392.34s]  I don't want to go over here.
[392.34s -> 395.11s]  I gave that up a while ago.
[395.11s -> 396.11s]  Oh, boy.
[396.11s -> 398.25s]  Dog.
[398.25s -> 399.25s]  Dog.
[399.25s -> 401.51s]  Oh, sit down.
[401.51s -> 402.51s]  Oh, no.
[402.51s -> 403.51s]  Oh, shit.
[403.75s -> 406.93s]  Dude, I just threw that behind my head.
[406.93s -> 408.93s]  Nice, like, nice toss, bro.
[408.93s -> 409.93s]  Guy right across.
[409.93s -> 410.93s]  Right in the corner.
[410.93s -> 413.26s]  Two of them.
[413.26s -> 414.26s]  Nice.
[414.26s -> 415.50s]  Careful.
[415.50s -> 416.50s]  I think there's still one over there.
[416.50s -> 417.50s]  Did we win?
[417.50s -> 418.50s]  Yep.
[418.50s -> 419.50s]  Hey, look at that.
[419.50s -> 421.50s]  The big victory sign will probably be an indication of that.
[421.50s -> 424.59s]  Nice.
[424.59s -> 426.79s]  Keep fueling.
[426.79s -> 430.22s]  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[430.22s -> 431.22s]  Rank seven.
