[0.31s -> 10.16s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[10.16s -> 13.96s]  Jirba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.96s -> 18.36s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer with the Southern Hospitality,
[18.36s -> 21.94s]  the Frontier Justice, and the Short Circuit. So,
[21.94s -> 25.04s]  what do I want to talk about in this video? You probably saw the title already.
[25.04s -> 27.74s]  You probably are wondering what the hell that means.
[27.74s -> 30.84s]  The TF2 movie, Valve working on a TF2 movie.
[30.84s -> 34.44s]  Let's back up for a second here, because this is some incredibly exciting news
[34.84s -> 37.64s]  that I got tipped off on a couple of days ago.
[37.64s -> 40.04s]  Somebody actually sent me a message saying this,
[40.04s -> 42.44s]  and I was like, really? Is this really gonna happen?
[42.44s -> 45.44s]  So, let me back up for a second. According to Valve,
[45.44s -> 49.74s]  according to Gabe Newell himself, he actually was on a podcast
[49.74s -> 52.74s]  no more than two or three days ago talking about this.
[52.74s -> 57.41s]  He said they are currently working on a Team Fortress 2 movie.
[57.41s -> 63.21s]  And he said that it initially started as a 90-minute feature-length film,
[63.21s -> 66.81s]  but they decided to scrap all that. They said that was a little too much work for them.
[66.81s -> 71.78s]  But my goodness gracious, guys, we are getting a TF2 movie.
[71.78s -> 75.18s]  Now, there is not many details about this, really, at all.
[75.18s -> 78.88s]  And a lot of us were wondering, back when they did the Adult Swim promos,
[78.88s -> 81.78s]  and when they started working with Adult Swim and Cartoon Network,
[81.78s -> 86.28s]  a lot of us were thinking, my God, are they gonna start working on a TF2 show
[86.28s -> 88.98s]  for Adult Swim or a TF2 show for Cartoon Network?
[88.98s -> 91.98s]  That's what was going through the cogs in the brains of a lot of us fans
[92.08s -> 94.58s]  and a lot of us enthusiasts of this game.
[94.58s -> 97.78s]  But nothing really ever came out. Nothing really came to fruition with that.
[97.78s -> 100.68s]  And I don't want to say that they might be working with Adult Swim,
[100.68s -> 104.18s]  because I don't know. I'm pretty sure, according to Gabe Newell,
[104.18s -> 105.98s]  that it's going to be in source filmmaker.
[105.98s -> 109.28s]  It's not going to be like a cartoon, an animated cartoon,
[109.28s -> 110.88s]  like an animated feature or something like that.
[110.88s -> 113.18s]  It's going to be in source filmmaker.
[113.18s -> 117.38s]  And it's going to be at least 15 minutes long, according to Gabe Newell.
[117.38s -> 120.58s]  So this could... I don't know what route they're going to take with this.
[120.58s -> 124.75s]  Are they going to set up a system where we could have potential sequels,
[124.75s -> 128.25s]  where this could be a monthly or a bimonthly, yearly?
[128.25s -> 129.45s]  Nobody knows at this point.
[129.45s -> 133.55s]  But all we know for certain is they are currently working on this.
[133.55s -> 136.85s]  And I want to get your guys' opinion on this, because this is huge news.
[136.85s -> 142.05s]  I'm actually pretty surprised that not very many people are talking about this right now.
[142.05s -> 144.65s]  This is massive news. This is not just a little thing like,
[144.65s -> 148.25s]  oh, you know, Meet the Pyros are going to be coming out at some point, like in the...
[148.25s -> 150.95s]  No, no, this is going to be an entire story.
[150.95s -> 153.85s]  It's going to be a beginning, middle, and an end.
[153.85s -> 157.65s]  A 15 to 20, 30 minute. Who knows how long they're going to make this.
[157.65s -> 160.35s]  But this is big deal. This is a big deal.
[160.35s -> 161.95s]  I don't know where they're going to go with it, though.
[161.95s -> 164.85s]  If you guys have any idea what they could potentially do,
[164.85s -> 167.75s]  are we going to start over with the Meet the Team videos?
[167.75s -> 170.35s]  Are they going to come out with like Meet the Engineer again,
[170.35s -> 172.05s]  but have it be 15 minutes long?
[172.05s -> 174.55s]  Are we going to get like new Meet the Team videos?
[174.55s -> 178.79s]  Or is it going to be, here's the team, you already met the team,
[178.79s -> 180.69s]  now here's what they do on a daily basis.
[180.69s -> 185.06s]  Like, oh, here's the engineer going and buying like a ham at the grocery store.
[185.06s -> 187.66s]  And there he is. He's checking out right now. $22.99.
[187.66s -> 189.96s]  Is that how much a ham costs? I don't know. Probably not.
[189.96s -> 191.96s]  It's probably more expensive. I don't know. I have no idea.
[191.96s -> 194.26s]  But anyways, where are they going to go with this?
[194.26s -> 203.03s]  I'm so excited because this means that not only is Team Fortress going to be as a series, a game,
[203.13s -> 206.23s]  but now it's going to be seen as an entirely new media.
[206.23s -> 213.03s]  It's going to be seen as a movie, as a television show, as a complete full force media front.
[213.03s -> 215.81s]  Team Fortress is not a game anymore.
[215.81s -> 217.41s]  It's a piece of freaking art.
[217.41s -> 222.41s]  And that's why I love this so much. Games are becoming not just video games anymore.
[222.41s -> 227.81s]  This is becoming whole series, whole entirely new ideas, new fronts, new media.
[227.81s -> 231.71s]  It's, it's, this is so exciting, guys, to see this because think about it.
[231.71s -> 233.71s]  Really think about this for a second.
[233.71s -> 236.21s]  This is probably going to be one of the first.
[236.21s -> 241.91s]  Well, actually, I guess you could say red versus blue and a couple others in the machinima category.
[241.91s -> 243.91s]  Because remember, not machinima the company.
[243.91s -> 248.61s]  I'm talking about the machinima, the term machinima, where you take a game engine
[248.61s -> 254.05s]  and you create some type of media with it, like a short film or a movie or a show.
[254.05s -> 255.65s]  That's what I'm talking about here.
[255.65s -> 259.75s]  And with something like this, when a company like Valve puts together these machinimas,
[259.75s -> 262.25s]  because essentially that's what it is, it's the source filmmaker.
[262.25s -> 265.15s]  They take their in-game engine and they make a movie from it.
[265.15s -> 268.85s]  If this takes off, if they for some reason blow out some deal
[268.85s -> 273.75s]  where they have like a 15-minute movie or like a 30-minute movie and it goes on Adult Swim,
[273.75s -> 276.95s]  or even if it doesn't, it doesn't even have to go on some major TV network.
[276.95s -> 278.55s]  It might just be on YouTube.
[278.55s -> 279.95s]  Nobody knows at this point.
[279.95s -> 281.75s]  But let's just say something like that happened.
[281.75s -> 286.35s]  Let's just say you see you turn on your TV in like a few months or six months or whatever.
[286.35s -> 288.95s]  Whenever they finish this damn thing, who knows when they're going to do that.
[288.95s -> 294.65s]  But let's say you turn your TV on and you see, oh, Team Fortress like 8 p.m., 7 p.m. Central Time.
[294.65s -> 296.95s]  Like make sure you tune in on NBC.
[296.95s -> 302.75s]  That is going to change the world because so many people that have never had any idea
[302.75s -> 309.15s]  what this series was or what this franchise was or what machinima is and what gaming videos are.
[309.15s -> 313.93s]  This could change the world, guys, when it comes to gaming content as art.
[313.93s -> 315.43s]  And we have been making strides.
[315.43s -> 319.53s]  I actually talked about this in a video before about video games.
[319.53s -> 321.33s]  They're not video games anymore.
[321.33s -> 324.43s]  We are not playing a video game anymore.
[324.43s -> 330.83s]  What this is, this is turning into a whole new form of expression, a whole new form of media.
[330.83s -> 333.13s]  And it is incredibly exciting to see that.
[333.13s -> 337.13s]  No longer is it just, oh, what's little Billy doing over there?
[337.13s -> 340.23s]  Oh, well, he's just playing that Super Mario, brother.
[340.23s -> 341.93s]  It's like, no, that's not what he's doing.
[341.93s -> 343.03s]  That's not it anymore.
[343.03s -> 345.73s]  It's not just pick it up for 15 seconds.
[345.73s -> 347.83s]  And did you beat the level?
[347.83s -> 349.63s]  Yes, you beat level two.
[349.63s -> 352.43s]  These are completely, this is completely changing the world.
[352.43s -> 354.63s]  And I'm so happy to see this, guys.
[354.63s -> 356.03s]  And that's my time.
[356.03s -> 359.43s]  I think I'm over talking now, but thank you so much for watching everybody.
[359.43s -> 361.03s]  This is exciting news.
[361.03s -> 363.73s]  If you knew about this beforehand, then awesome.
[363.73s -> 367.63s]  But I did not know about this till at least like three or four days ago.
[367.63s -> 372.33s]  So it's interesting to know that they're working on this and we're going to get a TF2 freaking movie.
[372.33s -> 375.20s]  It's actually going to be a thing, guys.
[375.20s -> 377.30s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys all next time.
[377.30s -> 380.40s]  And of course, thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all soon.
[380.40s -> 381.70s]  Take care, everybody.
