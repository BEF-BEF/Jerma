[5.69s -> 9.69s]  Hey, how you doing everybody? Good evening, good morning, good afternoon, good night.
[9.69s -> 13.69s]  Hi, I'm Jerma. This is a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress 2.
[13.69s -> 18.69s]  And we're going to talk about some things today. This is Demolin Night with the Double Donker, Loose Cannon.
[18.69s -> 23.69s]  Although I don't really do very many double donks with it. I was just kind of messing around, just wanted to get a gameplay real quick.
[23.69s -> 27.69s]  So I could talk about some things. And we have a lot to talk about.
[27.69s -> 33.69s]  There are a lot of things to discuss in this video. We're going to go over the first one really specifically, really quickly.
[33.69s -> 38.86s]  Tip of the Hats is this coming weekend. So today, I believe I'm recording this on Monday.
[38.86s -> 46.28s]  So Tip of the Hats starts on the 19th of Saturday. It's the yearly charity event that the TF2 community puts together.
[46.28s -> 50.28s]  It's a lot of great people involved and it goes to a great charity, the donations.
[50.28s -> 58.28s]  So come hang out. I'll be there for a lot of it. I don't know what my exact time slots will be when I'm going to be pubbing and playing and just hanging out.
[58.28s -> 62.28s]  I'll be there for a lot of it. So come, it's the link will be there in the description. Come check it out.
[62.28s -> 67.28s]  TipoftheHats.org is the website as well. I encourage you to check it out.
[67.28s -> 73.28s]  So next thing we're going to do really, really quickly. This is going to be a real rapid fire update video. A real rapid fire update video.
[73.28s -> 76.28s]  There's an update. There's an update right there. There's an update over here.
[76.28s -> 84.28s]  So I'm fully moved in. I am in my new place. I'm settled. I got all my stuff here. Everything is here. I don't have to go back and forth anymore.
[84.28s -> 89.28s]  That was the big problem with trying to settle in here. Every day there was something else.
[89.28s -> 99.28s]  For the last like month and a half straight, I had like no. I mean, I had free time, but every ounce of my free time, I'd sit down to play a game or I'd sit down to do something.
[99.28s -> 104.28s]  And like, there's like somebody at my door. Yeah, we're here to fucking tear something down and put something up.
[104.28s -> 111.52s]  I'm like, OK, come on in, gentlemen. It's just been kind of a roller coaster these last couple of months. But the good thing is it's over.
[111.52s -> 116.52s]  You know, I'm here. I'm living here. No constraints. I can do what I need. I can do what I please.
[116.52s -> 121.52s]  I am just so excited. We got another update coming in. Keep the updates coming.
[121.52s -> 129.43s]  My stream. As of this video tonight, I'm going to be streaming at least three or four times a week.
[129.43s -> 135.43s]  This is the announcement video. This is the come to my Twitch channel. Come and check it out. I will be live a lot.
[135.43s -> 142.67s]  Now, I don't have exact times and I probably never will because me and schedules, we've talked about this a thousand times.
[142.67s -> 150.67s]  I don't do well with a schedule ever. I think I've said this in at least like five or six different videos.
[150.67s -> 157.85s]  But the point is, I'm going to turn it on whenever I'm comfortable sitting here, ready to go, ready to stream.
[157.85s -> 164.34s]  Is it two o'clock in the morning? I don't know. Is it four o'clock in the afternoon? Potentially.
[164.34s -> 167.34s]  Could it be a morning breakfast show? You betcha.
[167.34s -> 173.58s]  But I'm not going to pigeonhole myself into a particular time or a particular game for that matter.
[173.58s -> 179.58s]  Don't expect to open up this stream and see Diablo 3 for seven straight months. It's not going to happen.
[179.58s -> 185.58s]  Because streaming for me is serious. Wait, wait, wait. This update's not done. I'm not done. This update. Stop.
[185.58s -> 191.58s]  This update isn't done yet. In fact, don't fucking do it again. Just don't. That's so done by this point. Just don't do it again.
[192.58s -> 201.58s]  Streaming for me is going to be more of a chilled out, relaxed atmosphere. I'm not doing it for a bigger paycheck or anything like that.
[201.58s -> 206.58s]  It's just I want to be able to chill with you guys, relax in the chat. Everybody has fun and we play whatever.
[206.58s -> 213.64s]  Also, we can talk about YouTube streaming a little bit here, too. It just came into beta. It's out. I can stream on it.
[213.64s -> 219.64s]  I can use YouTube Gaming, the live platform, right now if I wanted to. But initially, I don't think I'm going to.
[219.64s -> 226.64s]  Because the chat's just really not that great. It's in its very early infancy stages and Twitch is established.
[226.64s -> 232.64s]  It's ready to be used right now. I have a partnership on Twitch. I can stream in 720, 1080, whatever I want.
[232.64s -> 241.94s]  I might stream on YouTube eventually. Once it gets into like the adolescent stage, maybe I'll switch over to YouTube and it'll be a little bit easier for me.
[241.94s -> 247.94s]  But I don't know. I might do both. You might see a YouTube stream sometimes. Maybe you'll see a Twitch stream. I don't know.
[249.18s -> 252.18s]  Keep it rolling. Keep it going. We get that aliens. Aliens are coming to TF2.
[252.18s -> 255.18s]  There's a UFO update or something that's got an invasion. I have no idea.
[255.18s -> 264.18s]  All I know is that I was in Dust Bowl, looked up, saw the UFO, shit my pants, and then went to Reddit and went to online and looking up all the information.
[264.18s -> 268.18s]  What's it going to be? Oh my God. There's a lot of hype around it right now.
[268.18s -> 272.49s]  And yeah, that's all right. What's the next thing? What are we on? What's coming up next?
[272.49s -> 277.66s]  I'm probably going to BlizzCon this year. I'm going to try my absolute hardest to be there.
[277.66s -> 283.14s]  Mainly because I didn't get to do anything really this year. I did PAX East, but that's it.
[283.14s -> 289.14s]  And I love going to conventions. And because of this whole buying this place and moving in and all these busy things that have been going on the last few months,
[289.14s -> 293.14s]  I didn't get to really do much. I couldn't go to PAX Prime. I couldn't go to E3.
[293.14s -> 298.14s]  So I want to make up for that. I want to go to BlizzCon and Overwatch is going to be there, so that's another huge reason to go.
[298.14s -> 305.38s]  So if you see me there, then just say hello. I'll bring it up again before BlizzCon happens. I believe it's November 10th, November 9th.
[305.38s -> 311.99s]  It's one of the first or second weeks of November is BlizzCon. But that's it. That's really all I have to say.
[311.99s -> 316.99s]  I just wanted to give as many updates as I possibly could because there's been a lot of shit going on.
[316.99s -> 322.99s]  And I just wanted to make a five or six minute video condensing all these topics down, reiterate a couple of things,
[322.99s -> 326.99s]  bring up some new stuff and that sort of thing. So thank you so much for watching. Really appreciate it.
[326.99s -> 332.17s]  Come to the Twitch stream. It's there. I don't know if I'm live right now. I might be. I might not be.
[332.17s -> 337.17s]  But if you haven't followed and you're into that sort of thing, then go ahead and follow it.
[337.17s -> 341.17s]  So thank you guys. I'll see you all soon. Take care everybody and good night.
