[0.31s -> 13.10s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Pit Fighter.
[13.10s -> 19.54s]  This is gonna be one of those games that's old, it's in that same category of, like, the Pac-Man games I played,
[19.54s -> 23.64s]  and the other weird, like, what-the-hell-is-this-game type of series.
[23.64s -> 28.54s]  And I can't, I can't even explain this game. It's atrocious, it's so stupid, it's a fighting game.
[28.54s -> 33.64s]  It's supposed to be, in quotes, a fighting game, but it's one of the worst games, like, ever made.
[33.64s -> 38.34s]  And you're gonna see why very shortly. I hope you guys enjoy it, live commentary's gonna kick in right now.
[38.34s -> 41.44s]  Just wanna do a brief introduction to it, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[41.44s -> 45.34s]  And of course, take care, everybody, even though I think I say that again in the end of the video.
[45.34s -> 48.60s]  But anyways, we'll say it twice, take care, everybody, see you soon, bye!
[48.60s -> 56.00s]  Okay, so here we go. We have the choice of being Buzz, the ex-pro wrestler, he's 6'2", 226.
[56.00s -> 59.50s]  Bonnie Slim, headbutt, pile driver, he's got a couple of moves there.
[59.50s -> 68.10s]  Ty, the kickboxing champion, 5'11", weighed 186 pounds, agility-based fighter, spin kick, flying kick, and roundhouse kick.
[68.10s -> 73.30s]  Or we can be Kato, the third-degree black belt from the five-foot nine-
[73.30s -> 76.81s]  You know, none of this matters, none of this- there's only three people you can choose from.
[76.81s -> 82.61s]  It doesn't matter who you pick. You could pick any of these guys, and the exact same thing's gonna happen. You ready?
[82.61s -> 90.95s]  You see, the best part about this game is it has some of the most beautifully rendered animations I've ever seen in my life.
[91.05s -> 96.95s]  Take a look at how, like, the one or two sprites that were used to create the fantastic punching and kicking-
[96.95s -> 107.23s]  What? I've never done that before! What the hell was that? I just, like, pancaked him.
[107.23s -> 113.16s]  I'm gonna lose. It's very simple, there's, like, two buttons to this game. There's a punch, and there's a kick.
[113.16s -> 118.56s]  And apparently there's a jump, yeah, there is. That's just beautiful-looking, by the way.
[118.56s -> 129.04s]  Come here, you fat fuck- NO! Look, your health's in the top left. I gotta beat this guy! I got five, he's got five.
[129.04s -> 134.42s]  It's over, I lost. That was the game, by the way.
[134.42s -> 142.66s]  Another really stupid thing that you're probably going to realize is each one of these guys has the same stupid sound.
[142.66s -> 145.86s]  When you pick anyone- I just picked this guy. Ready, listen to this.
[148.76s -> 153.69s]  Look at how much the crowd just looks like utter shit, by the way.
[153.79s -> 158.63s]  I don't remember any crowd being, like, sepia tone in my life.
[158.63s -> 163.52s]  Alright, hold on, I might be able to pull this out. I might be able to pull this through.
[163.52s -> 172.84s]  Ooh, did you see that little spin kick? This is, like, the tutorial.
[172.84s -> 176.34s]  Oh, jam it. Jam it. Damn it! I got it! I got it!
[176.34s -> 180.98s]  Alright, that's the first time I've, like, ever beat that guy, so that's a good thing.
[180.98s -> 188.49s]  Gradually- why am I on a forklift? Alright, match two, you guys ready? Match two.
[188.49s -> 198.21s]  Look at my health! Why did I start with that little health?
[198.21s -> 199.01s]  I go-
[206.55s -> 214.64s]  Okay, I have 65 health. I'm gonna start the next fight with 65 health.
[214.64s -> 220.67s]  That's- that's fucking bullshit. That is absolute, complete, utter crap.
[220.67s -> 225.87s]  Look at- this guy has 260 health. This game is not possible to complete.
[225.87s -> 231.81s]  You can't complete this! How would you ever be able to do this?
[231.91s -> 238.32s]  It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't- it doesn't make any sense why that would ever be a thing.
[238.32s -> 245.22s]  Every fighting game I've ever played in my whole life, this is Street Fighter 1, this is Clay Fighter,
[245.22s -> 251.92s]  that's, like, a staple of all fighters. Why would you ever remove that? Why would you ever not do that?
[251.92s -> 255.62s]  Everybody starts with the same health when there's a new round.
[255.62s -> 259.92s]  Why would you remove that from this game? That's what I don't get. I don't understand that.
[259.92s -> 270.68s]  This game is so fucking stupid.
[270.68s -> 276.61s]  I just wanna- I wanna get past the first two guys. Is that so much to ask?
[276.61s -> 280.51s]  Who made this game? I don't even know who made this game.
[280.51s -> 286.28s]  All I remember is playing it for Super Nintendo and the arcade. This was in the arcades.
[286.28s -> 290.89s]  How much money do you think people wasted on this game in the arcade?
[290.89s -> 298.12s]  You probably had to throw, like, 30 bucks in the machine to be able to go past the first two guys.
[298.12s -> 301.10s]  It doesn't matter what you do. It really doesn't.
[301.10s -> 305.50s]  The guy with the cheap Halloween costume on is gonna beat you every time.
[305.50s -> 312.60s]  Unless you get lucky and you get him, like, in, like, a stun lock, you'll never beat this guy.
[312.60s -> 316.70s]  I wonder if there are, like, actual strategies. Did they make, like, a strategy guide for this game?
[316.70s -> 319.50s]  I wonder what the hell is in, like, the- you open it up and what does it say?
[319.50s -> 325.77s]  Press all buttons! That's- oh, yeah, that thing, and then the book closes.
[325.77s -> 331.27s]  Copyright 1991 THQ incorporated. Toy Headquarters.
[331.27s -> 339.44s]  What the hell- what does that mean? Toy Headquarters? Toy- like, toys?
[339.44s -> 343.19s]  I don't have any idea what that's supposed to mean.
[343.19s -> 347.69s]  What- welcome- oh, yeah, this game is made by THQ. The Toy Headquarters.
[347.69s -> 353.62s]  This is where Santa gets all his, like, fucking toys for Christmas.
[353.62s -> 355.55s]  I'm- it's over. I'm dead.
[355.55s -> 359.83s]  I'm using the controller, too. Can I, like, hack? Can I cheat to win?
[359.83s -> 362.49s]  I wonder if I can use, like, cheats.
[362.49s -> 367.23s]  What's, like, the code I have to put in? Like, up, up, down, down, B, B, B, T, T, T, T, T, Y, Y, T, T.
[367.23s -> 373.90s]  T? There's never been a controller with a T on it.
[373.90s -> 380.81s]  This is the type of game that you really- I really can't even imagine how this was even developed.
[380.81s -> 386.31s]  This game is so broken and so awful, I don't even know how this game was even developed.
[386.31s -> 391.01s]  What did they use? Did they use, like, a cereal box and a pen and paper to make this game?
[391.01s -> 395.75s]  Like, honest to God. Honest to God, how did they make this game?
[395.75s -> 399.35s]  They had some guy, like, take a couple pictures with his shirt off,
[399.35s -> 402.15s]  and then they put, like, a couple Halloween costumes on,
[402.15s -> 406.05s]  and then some guy took a fucking cereal box and started, like, drawing on it,
[406.05s -> 413.03s]  and then they, like, jammed it in a computer and, like, mashed on Enter until the game was, like, until, like, this popped out.
[413.03s -> 422.24s]  They stuffed it in the CD drive.
[422.24s -> 425.58s]  The elbow's working. The elbow!
[425.58s -> 428.17s]  Oh my God, did I just find, like, the strategy?
[428.17s -> 430.82s]  Okay, I got 144 health.
[430.82s -> 435.52s]  Okay, come on. I gotta beat the second guy with the elbow strat.
[435.52s -> 438.02s]  Yeah, you made it. Let's go. I don't care.
[438.02s -> 444.37s]  Elbow strat. Elbow strat's gonna kick this guy's ass.
[444.37s -> 449.30s]  Yes. Yes! Yes!
[449.30s -> 453.00s]  You can't fuck with the elbow strat.
[453.00s -> 457.70s]  It's working. I'm gonna beat this guy. I'm gonna beat this guy. I'm gonna beat this guy.
[457.70s -> 464.83s]  Oh, no. Come on. Come on.
[464.83s -> 467.80s]  Yes! Yes! I did it.
[467.80s -> 471.78s]  That's the second guy. That's the second guy.
[471.78s -> 477.56s]  Alright. 89 health. Bring it on.
[477.56s -> 485.46s]  Grudge match? What? What?
[485.46s -> 491.24s]  What?
[491.24s -> 495.55s]  Alright, well, apparently I hit you more times than you hit me.
[495.55s -> 499.44s]  I've no... What the hell is this?
[499.54s -> 501.14s]  Alright, here we go. Let's go, man.
[501.14s -> 503.77s]  What? It's something like Lady.
[503.77s -> 507.80s]  Just stick to the elbow strat. That's the only thing that matters.
[507.80s -> 511.50s]  As long as you do the elbow strat with the kickboxer, you're gonna win.
[511.50s -> 516.33s]  Or you're gonna get stun-locked and, like, instantly... It's over. I lost.
[516.33s -> 519.43s]  Nah, it's over.
[519.43s -> 522.63s]  If you think I'm gonna start over again and do this all again,
[522.63s -> 525.65s]  get out of your mind.
[525.65s -> 527.45s]  And what's with the money?
[527.45s -> 531.95s]  What is with the money in the top left? I don't understand. Like, I have $12,000.
[532.05s -> 537.16s]  There's no upgrade system. There's no... There's nothing. It's just, like, points.
[537.16s -> 541.99s]  That's points, and they put a dollar symbol behind it.
[541.99s -> 544.99s]  Whatever. This is... I'm done.
[544.99s -> 547.07s]  I'm done playing this game.
[547.07s -> 550.17s]  That's Pit Fighter, guys.
[550.17s -> 553.07s]  One of the dumbest, worst games I've ever played in my life.
[553.07s -> 555.27s]  But I'll see you guys all next time. Thanks so much for watching.
[555.27s -> 557.27s]  Take care, everybody. See you all soon.
