[4.92s -> 9.64s]  Hey, you, person that just landed on the channel page. What's going on? My name is Germa985.
[9.64s -> 12.76s]  Or you can just call me Germa. That's what most people around here call me.
[12.76s -> 18.36s]  I'm a gaming channel. You probably could guess that by all the different playlists and all the videos below,
[18.36s -> 23.08s]  which you should check out and you should go watch some of them right now and possibly subscribe.
[23.08s -> 26.44s]  That's the whole purpose of this video. I'm trying to get you to subscribe to my channel.
[26.44s -> 28.68s]  So hey, subscribe to the channel! Subscribe!
[28.68s -> 33.00s]  You see on this channel, I like to call myself Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Germa,
[33.00s -> 38.52s]  because I have two different sides. I have the very professional side where I review content.
[38.52s -> 45.64s]  I review packages. What? I don't review packages. I review like games. Oh, here's like, here's a cup.
[45.64s -> 49.40s]  This cup is good. There's a whole lot of stuff here though. I have my fun.
[49.40s -> 57.00s]  I have my professional side and I mold them together into sort of this lunacy that is Germa985.
[57.00s -> 61.32s]  So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an explanation of this channel and
[61.32s -> 67.16s]  hopefully you subscribe as well. So please subscribe, subscribe, and subscribe and I'll
[67.16s -> 75.38s]  subscribe you all next time. And of course, subscribe, subscribe. Bye. Okay. Yeah.
[75.38s -> 79.86s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Hey, what is going on everybody? Hey, what is going on everybody?
[79.86s -> 84.02s]  Germa here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[84.02s -> 88.98s]  Meet me at the statue at 12 o'clock, okay? I don't know what the statue is. I don't play this game.
[88.98s -> 93.38s]  Oh wait, I'm going to bang. No! What? Oh, what was that? You were going to bang? What?
[93.38s -> 97.14s]  What were you going to do? You were going to bang me? Oh, there we go.
[99.70s -> 105.78s]  So of course as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work because you can jump real high. I
[105.78s -> 110.34s]  never understood that by the way that why does Mario have to do everything? He's like the saviour
[110.34s -> 116.14s]  of the world because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan. Left or right? Left or right?
[116.14s -> 119.10s]  We're going to go left. Oh man.
[126.46s -> 130.38s]  I knew it. I knew what was going to happen too and it still doesn't matter.
[130.38s -> 135.18s]  What I'm talking about here is you'll see it. I go like me, me, me, me. Almost like I'm sweeping
[135.18s -> 140.78s]  the screen, not with my mouse, but with my A and D keys. And it's something I don't know why I do
[140.78s -> 145.50s]  this. And I think it's because I have a lot of trouble aiming with the mouse more so than I do,
[145.50s -> 150.30s]  which just kind of getting people in front of my crosshair. But I kill every single person almost
[150.30s -> 152.78s]  by doing the sway in quotes.
[183.00s -> 186.76s]  in the world. And I'll show you right here. Look at this. Get the fuck out of here, buddy.
[187.80s -> 193.16s]  And let me tell you, did I really have this in me the whole time? And the answer is yes,
[193.80s -> 199.88s]  everybody does. Everybody has it in them. You have it in you. You can, you can actually do it.
[199.88s -> 204.20s]  You just have to tell yourself it's possible and you have to act on those possibilities.
[213.72s -> 224.71s]  Hi guys. Today we're going to create a fucking washer, dryer, a generous channel there.
[227.05s -> 230.73s]  All right, fine. Right here. So he already finished it. That was it.
