[0.31s -> 13.46s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Paranormal.
[13.46s -> 17.46s]  Now this game is not out yet. This is in beta. Not even clo-
[17.46s -> 21.22s]  Okay, that like kinda scared me. The furnace just turned on.
[21.22s -> 27.22s]  Alright, anyways. This is in beta. It has a Kickstarter project. You can go in the link in the description.
[27.22s -> 33.22s]  And you can go support this guy. You can get this game right now. 30 bucks is gonna get you the beta.
[33.22s -> 38.22s]  So, you can check that out. That just threw me off my game. Let's just get going.
[39.90s -> 40.90s]  Let's begin.
[53.14s -> 56.14s]  So I guess the whole point of this game is you have a camera.
[56.14s -> 61.14s]  And you need to capture the hauntings, or you need to go walk around the house and film things that are going on.
[61.14s -> 62.14s]  So let's do this.
[65.32s -> 68.95s]  Okay. Left mouse to begin.
[68.95s -> 72.60s]  Enter the haunting in 3, 2, 1.
[72.60s -> 76.38s]  Oh my god.
[76.38s -> 79.45s]  Alright. So let's just start looking around.
[79.45s -> 83.54s]  Little doll. Hello!
[83.54s -> 87.50s]  I have a- What's opening?
[87.50s -> 90.82s]  What door is opening right now?
[90.82s -> 98.47s]  If there's monsters in this game, like if these little things come alive and start attacking me or something, I'm gonna flip out.
[98.47s -> 104.10s]  It's a kitchen.
[104.10s -> 106.92s]  So like I said, this has a Kickstarter project.
[106.92s -> 109.92s]  It's got a lot of money raised so far. It's actually pretty interesting.
[110.92s -> 112.10s]  Ah!
[112.10s -> 116.50s]  Oh, that's not so bad.
[116.50s -> 117.50s]  It's-
[117.50s -> 124.47s]  God!
[124.47s -> 128.47s]  That was the biggest scare so far out of any game I've played. That's a horror game.
[128.47s -> 135.15s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[135.15s -> 137.15s]  What is that thing? What is that guy over there?
[137.15s -> 141.95s]  Is that guy gonna attack me?
[141.95s -> 146.26s]  Oh, come on. No way. What am I, stuck in the kitchen?
[146.26s -> 149.07s]  Turn this off.
[151.07s -> 155.14s]  Oh, my arm hurts right now from that scare.
[155.14s -> 160.54s]  What is making that buzzing like a- I feel like my phone is vibrating.
[160.54s -> 164.63s]  Like, seriously.
[164.63s -> 165.63s]  Stop it!
[165.63s -> 171.70s]  Can I go up here?
[171.70s -> 174.70s]  That, seriously, that noise needs to-
[174.70s -> 176.70s]  I'm gonna freak out.
[176.70s -> 178.70s]  Let's go upstairs.
[178.70s -> 180.70s]  Up the stairs we go.
[180.70s -> 189.22s]  To try and find the vibrating cell phone.
[189.22s -> 191.98s]  Oh, thanks.
[191.98s -> 193.98s]  Whoever's doing that.
[193.98s -> 200.12s]  Bedroom. Okay, so I have to sleep.
[200.12s -> 202.86s]  Hi, Fit!
[202.86s -> 205.16s]  Did I just- Did I just take-
[205.16s -> 206.16s]  I didn't close that door.
[206.16s -> 207.16s]  Hey.
[207.16s -> 210.16s]  So, I'm assuming it's a new day. Camera is charged.
[210.16s -> 212.16s]  My fish are gone. Somebody stole them.
[212.16s -> 214.16s]  Which, that's just fantastic.
[216.16s -> 218.55s]  Get-
[218.55s -> 220.55s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[220.55s -> 222.55s]  Close the door! Close the door!
[230.04s -> 231.04s]  Oh, damn.
[231.04s -> 234.66s]  Somebody was- Why am I not in the reflection?
[234.66s -> 238.18s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[239.18s -> 243.38s]  Dude, the beaver- Dude, somebody had a bad case of burritos.
[243.38s -> 245.38s]  I'll tell you that right now. That's not cool.
[245.38s -> 247.56s]  What kind of bathroom is this, by the way?
[247.56s -> 249.56s]  This guy has like a forest in his bathroom.
[249.56s -> 253.78s]  Painting in the bloody-
[253.78s -> 254.78s]  That's weird.
[254.78s -> 258.56s]  Do I even want to open this door?
[258.56s -> 260.56s]  Is there gonna be like a dude here with like a-
[260.56s -> 262.18s]  Okay.
[262.18s -> 266.09s]  Let's go back downstairs.
[266.09s -> 268.09s]  Let's film some more happenings.
[269.09s -> 270.09s]  You little-
[271.84s -> 273.84s]  I'm gonna kick him down.
[273.84s -> 281.01s]  There's the phone again.
[281.01s -> 284.85s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[284.85s -> 285.85s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[285.85s -> 286.85s]  God!
[286.85s -> 295.86s]  I'm running. I'm run, run, run, run, run, run.
[295.86s -> 297.86s]  Run down the stairs. Run down the stairs.
[297.86s -> 299.86s]  Why can't I move? I can't move.
[299.86s -> 301.86s]  I can't move right now.
[302.86s -> 303.86s]  What is that?
[305.16s -> 306.16s]  They're all-
[306.16s -> 308.10s]  I was just stuck.
[310.69s -> 314.85s]  God, come on!
[314.85s -> 315.85s]  Where's the-
[315.85s -> 319.75s]  Alright, I'm gonna find that damn phone,
[319.75s -> 321.75s]  and I'm gonna turn it off, and I'm gonna throw it.
[321.75s -> 323.75s]  There it is! There it is! There's the phone.
[323.75s -> 324.75s]  There's the phone.
[324.75s -> 328.85s]  I don't, like, answer the phone?
[328.85s -> 332.58s]  Is that a dog?
[332.58s -> 335.21s]  The phone didn't do anything.
[335.21s -> 337.34s]  What the hell?
[337.34s -> 338.34s]  At least I turned it off.
[338.34s -> 340.84s]  Alright, now I turned off that.
[340.84s -> 343.66s]  What's going on?
[346.46s -> 349.66s]  God damn!
[349.66s -> 351.66s]  I'm outta here.
[351.66s -> 359.55s]  I'm-
[359.55s -> 362.18s]  I'm getting the hell outta here.
[362.18s -> 363.18s]  I'm getting the hell outta here.
[363.18s -> 365.42s]  Can I, like, leave the house?
[365.42s -> 368.85s]  Alright, I've done. I finished. I got all I needed.
[368.85s -> 372.15s]  I recorded the monsters and the noises.
[375.18s -> 377.32s]  Ugh.
[377.32s -> 378.32s]  Let's, uh-
[378.32s -> 380.32s]  Let's call that- I can't do it anymore.
[380.32s -> 382.32s]  My brain is like-
[382.32s -> 388.53s]  Okay, that guy was not there before.
[388.53s -> 392.18s]  I'll see you guys all next time,
[392.18s -> 393.18s]  and go check this game out.
[393.18s -> 394.18s]  It is the-
[394.18s -> 396.18s]  It's got a Kickstarter project, like I said before.
[396.18s -> 398.18s]  And, yeah, that's gonna wrap it up.
[398.18s -> 400.18s]  First, we're gonna look outside, and yeah!
[401.18s -> 404.25s]  I thought that was a, uh-
[404.25s -> 405.25s]  What is that?
[405.25s -> 406.25s]  It's gone.
[406.25s -> 408.25s]  Alright, so take care, everybody.
[408.25s -> 410.25s]  I'll see you all soon.
[410.25s -> 412.25s]  Run away from this house!
[412.25s -> 416.09s]  Rest in peace, boy.
[416.09s -> 417.09s]  What?
