[0.82s -> 10.06s]  I was looking for a health pack. What did I do?
[10.06s -> 16.27s]  Hold on, hold on. I found a wild Shpee. He's a baby. He doesn't know where he is.
[16.27s -> 22.28s]  He's figuring out how to use the disguise kit. I figured out how to use
[22.28s -> 31.86s]  the... I just killed a baby Shpee.
[31.86s -> 46.20s]  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
[46.20s -> 60.08s]  Oh, I think this is him. Oh no. Did the baby Shpee make it out okay?
[60.08s -> 66.50s]  I need to check on him. Where is he? There he is. Okay, baby Shpee.
[66.50s -> 72.32s]  Are you alright? No, that's not a baby. That's not a baby Shpee. That's an adult.
[72.32s -> 79.93s]  That was an adult. What are you doing, baby?
[79.93s -> 83.76s]  What are you doing? You can't get over to the tires. What are you doing?
[83.76s -> 88.91s]  I have to go into the tires. I need to get this way.
[88.91s -> 92.61s]  I am a Shpee. Ahhhh.
[92.61s -> 99.28s]  How could you? He was a baby. So while you are
[99.28s -> 103.98s]  baby Shpee watching, one thing you really have to do, guys, is you have to protect
[104.08s -> 106.88s]  the really young ones, the ones that just got out of the nest.
[106.88s -> 108.98s]  They're not going to be too sure what's happening.
[108.98s -> 112.18s]  You have to be there to protect them, to lead them in the right way,
[112.18s -> 117.68s]  because their mother is not here. Baby Shpees leave the nest at 11 days old.
[117.68s -> 120.28s]  And you see this one right here is walking all over the map.
[120.28s -> 123.78s]  He's not exactly sure where he's going. I'm not sure if he's looking for food,
[123.78s -> 127.48s]  if he's trying to scavenge a rat or a mouse somewhere. That could be the case.
[127.48s -> 130.78s]  His legs are not strong. As you see here, he's standing still.
[130.78s -> 133.48s]  He doesn't get strong enough legs until he gets to adolescence.
[133.48s -> 137.18s]  So that's something to keep in mind. We're going to hope he gets his first kill here,
[137.18s -> 141.18s]  because if a baby Shpee gets his first kill, then they can get their wings
[141.18s -> 143.38s]  and they can start to fly. And I'm really hoping.
[143.38s -> 145.28s]  I don't want to mess around with nature right here, guys.
[145.28s -> 148.08s]  I'm going to try to lead him in the right direction as best as I can,
[148.08s -> 151.38s]  but not a good idea right now. He's coming back to the enemy spawn.
[151.38s -> 154.38s]  I'm not sure what he's disguised as. This is not a good situation.
[154.38s -> 156.38s]  I might have to come out here. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[156.38s -> 160.18s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't, don't, don't.
[160.18s -> 164.78s]  So I have made it my mission to be able to protect the baby Shpees at all costs.
[164.78s -> 167.68s]  I'm going to go heavy. I'm going to protect this guy at all costs.
[167.68s -> 170.88s]  No matter what happens, I am going to protect that he's dead.
[170.88s -> 174.94s]  Hi. Hi.
[174.94s -> 177.98s]  Set up time. Hi.
[177.98s -> 180.98s]  You want to play spy? Yes, we're supposed to be.
[180.98s -> 182.98s]  You want to Shpee? Yes. Yes.
[182.98s -> 184.98s]  Okay. Sniper, hi.
[184.98s -> 186.98s]  We both die. We'll walk out spawn and die.
[186.98s -> 188.98s]  I die. This is walk out spawn, same time, die.
[188.98s -> 191.98s]  I love you. Okay, we'll walk out spawn, same time, die.
[191.98s -> 193.98s]  Okay, I follow you. We both go.
[194.98s -> 206.70s]  I'm really happy about this one, guys. I'm so glad we found this.
[206.70s -> 211.70s]  Statistically, about 700 Shpees are born every minute.
[211.70s -> 216.70s]  And unfortunately, only about two will ever survive leaving the nest.
[216.70s -> 219.70s]  We have found one of those spies right here.
[219.70s -> 221.70s]  Looks like he's got himself a good job, maybe a wife.
[221.70s -> 223.70s]  He probably even has a nest of his own.
[223.70s -> 228.70s]  He has reached spyhood. He is no longer a Shrey.
