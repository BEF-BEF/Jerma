[60.01s -> 83.98s]  Okay. I guess he was an enemy. What? Stop doing that. You killed me.
[83.98s -> 91.93s]  Man, they spent a lot of time on this game. Trying to make everybody look like they're busy. And I'm a little busy taking out some grunts.

[233.53s -> 245.53s]  Yes. Slam dunk. He even broke the backboard with that. Did you see the backboard shatter when Shaq did the slam? Who did I say Kevin Garnett? I didn't say Shaq.
[245.53s -> 249.53s]  Oh, whatever. Whoever basketball player did that. That was really awesome.
