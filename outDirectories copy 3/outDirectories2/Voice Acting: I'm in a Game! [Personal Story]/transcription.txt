[0.31s -> 14.13s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Galactic Fantasy Prelude.
[14.13s -> 18.13s]  Now before anybody says, oh my god, what the hell is this game? I've never heard of this. I'm outta here.
[18.13s -> 23.13s]  Just bear with me for a second. Maybe you saw the title. This is not gonna be a gameplay commentary of this game.
[23.13s -> 30.13s]  I'm not gonna talk about this game really at all, besides the fact of one very specific detail that of course is very, very important.
[30.13s -> 35.13s]  I'm in this game. I am a voice actor in this game. I have almost a hundred lines.
[35.13s -> 39.13s]  And that's gonna be the discussion and the topic of this video. I'm gonna talk about voice acting.
[39.13s -> 44.63s]  I'm gonna talk about my voice acting, quote, career, if you could even call it that, and that sort of stuff.
[44.63s -> 50.13s]  So before I say anything about voice acting or the gameplay or anything like that in general,
[50.13s -> 55.13s]  the link in the description is gonna take you to the iTunes store for this game.
[55.13s -> 60.00s]  This is not a PC game. This is not a console game. This is an iOS game.
[60.00s -> 64.50s]  So it's gonna be on your iPhone, your iPad, and I don't think it's on Android.
[64.50s -> 68.18s]  But it could be. I could be completely wrong with that. But the iTunes link is gonna be there.
[68.18s -> 72.18s]  And yeah, I'm in this game. I voice acted the whole thing as the character Matt.
[72.18s -> 77.42s]  So you are free to go download that. It's, I believe, 99 cents for the iPhone version.
[77.42s -> 79.92s]  And you'll hear me talk through the course of the game as you play through.
[79.92s -> 82.42s]  It's got a whole storyline. It's got a beginning, middle, and end.
[82.42s -> 88.42s]  I'm not sure how difficult the game is. I know it's a very, very intense shooting kind of RPG type game.
[88.42s -> 91.42s]  So I don't know if you can blow right through the game in 15 minutes.
[91.42s -> 95.92s]  It's probably gonna take you a while to hear all my lines, if that's what you're playing the game for.
[95.92s -> 98.42s]  But it is there in the description nonetheless.
[98.42s -> 101.98s]  So let's actually take a listen to a couple of lines that I have,
[101.98s -> 104.48s]  just so you can see and kind of hear what's going on.
[104.48s -> 107.48s]  I'm not gonna do too many. I'm just gonna do maybe one or two lines in a row.
[107.48s -> 109.48s]  And we'll get back to the meat and potatoes of this video,
[109.48s -> 112.98s]  which is gonna be my story, I guess, of how I got to this position,
[112.98s -> 116.48s]  how I got to do this game, and other various things like that.
[116.48s -> 119.48s]  Because I'm so passionate about voice acting, guys.
[119.48s -> 123.98s]  I've been doing it for a long time, off and on, doing flash cartoons, doing little stuff like this.
[123.98s -> 127.98s]  And I'm so passionate about this, and I see comments all the time telling me,
[127.98s -> 130.98s]  Jerma, you have so many voices, you do so many characters,
[130.98s -> 132.48s]  you gotta try to get into voice acting.
[132.48s -> 136.48s]  And I would love to answer these type of questions and these comments in a Q&A video.
[136.48s -> 139.98s]  But there's just so much to talk about, and there's such a big backstory with this,
[139.98s -> 141.98s]  that it has to be its own video.
[141.98s -> 145.98s]  I would never be comfortable doing this in like a two-minute question and answer period.
[145.98s -> 148.28s]  So without further ado, let's get started here.
[148.28s -> 151.78s]  I'm gonna show you a couple of clips back-to-back, as me as the character Matt.
[151.78s -> 155.28s]  And when we get back, we shall talk about some more stuff, so enjoy, guys.
[182.44s -> 183.44s]  I see.
[183.44s -> 185.44s]  Buy some plutonium right away.
[185.44s -> 187.44s]  Set a course for Abaddon Starport.
[188.44s -> 191.76s]  Send a communication to Freeport authorities.
[191.76s -> 195.26s]  Tell them what happened here, and get them to send rescue shuttles immediately.
[195.26s -> 198.26s]  Having a pirate call the authorities?
[198.26s -> 200.26s]  You know, irony aside, we should move.
[200.26s -> 203.26s]  We're probably wanted men for stealing this ship already.
[203.26s -> 205.26s]  And I don't wanna be locked up for the rest of my life.
[212.76s -> 216.26s]  My family was killed by the slavers, so I have nowhere else to go.
[216.26s -> 217.76s]  May I join you?
[217.76s -> 221.96s]  I need to know for myself why this is happening.
[221.96s -> 224.46s]  Welcome back, everybody. Thank you for sticking around.
[224.46s -> 229.46s]  To listen to the backstory now of how I got into this sort of stuff, and why I got into it,
[229.46s -> 232.46s]  and how this has shaped this YouTube channel.
[232.46s -> 234.96s]  And if I did not get into voice acting when I did,
[234.96s -> 237.96s]  I probably would not have been even doing this YouTube channel.
[237.96s -> 240.96s]  I probably wouldn't even have attempted this YouTube channel.
[240.96s -> 242.96s]  Well, let's back up. Let's go back to when I was a younger kid,
[242.96s -> 245.96s]  when I was probably like 10, 11, or 12 years old.
[245.96s -> 247.96s]  And that's imitating people.
[247.96s -> 251.96s]  I used to sit around and just listen to my grandparents talk.
[251.96s -> 253.46s]  They used to have people come over for bridge.
[253.46s -> 257.14s]  If you were an old subscriber, you probably already know this story.
[257.14s -> 259.64s]  But I'll tell it again for those of you that might be new to the channel,
[259.64s -> 262.64s]  or might be a somewhat recent subscriber.
[262.64s -> 266.64s]  I used to sit there watching TV and listen to my grandparents have people over for bridge.
[266.64s -> 269.64s]  And there would be like 10 people over there, all yelling at each other,
[269.64s -> 273.64s]  all talking a bunch of trash, all trying to like figure out whose bet was what bet.
[273.64s -> 275.64s]  And I would just sit there and listen to them.
[275.64s -> 279.64s]  And I would be repeating their voices in my head over and over again.
[279.64s -> 282.64s]  And then when nobody was around, of course, I didn't just like walk up to the table
[282.64s -> 285.64s]  and was like, oh, hey, by the way, I'm going to like do all your voices in front of you.
[285.64s -> 289.64s]  When I was alone, I would just do them out loud and just laugh.
[289.64s -> 291.64s]  And it was pretty much just self-entertainment.
[291.64s -> 294.64s]  And I really truly think that if you are a voice actor,
[294.64s -> 297.14s]  or you want to get into voice acting, or you're one of those people
[297.14s -> 300.14s]  that can self-entertain yourself, that's where you start.
[300.14s -> 303.14s]  You kind of just make goofy faces in the mirror,
[303.14s -> 306.14s]  and you do goofy voices in the mirror, and you make yourself laugh.
[306.14s -> 310.14s]  And then eventually you take those ideas and you take those voices that you're doing,
[310.14s -> 312.14s]  and you do it to other people.
[312.14s -> 314.14s]  You do it to your friends, you do it to your other family members.
[314.14s -> 316.14s]  And they're like, how did you learn how to do that?
[316.14s -> 319.14s]  And you say, well, I just passed the time with it.
[319.14s -> 321.14s]  I just, you know, do it in the mirror, have fun.
[321.14s -> 323.14s]  I think it's funny. I mean, that's where everybody starts.
[323.14s -> 325.14s]  And the same thing with something like beatboxing as well.
[325.14s -> 327.14s]  I mean, I'm not the best beatboxer in the world,
[327.14s -> 330.14s]  but a lot of you guys that have heard me do random little beatboxes before,
[330.14s -> 332.14s]  I just did that for fun.
[332.14s -> 335.14s]  I would just sit there playing a video game and do it.
[335.14s -> 336.14s]  And I would do it all day.
[336.14s -> 338.14s]  And I would just eventually get good enough at it,
[338.14s -> 340.14s]  where I did it to other people, and they was like,
[340.14s -> 343.14s]  oh, geez, all right, cool, you can like kind of do that, that's cool.
[343.14s -> 346.14s]  And when I got to an older age, when I got to be,
[346.14s -> 350.38s]  maybe I'd say like 16, 17, or 18, right towards that college age,
[350.38s -> 352.38s]  I started talking to myself, and I'd say, you know,
[352.38s -> 354.55s]  what if I did this for a living?
[354.55s -> 358.55s]  What if I could really make these voices or make these things part of my everyday life
[358.55s -> 362.55s]  and try to entertain people, try to make people laugh as my job?
[362.55s -> 365.98s]  And it was around this point when I started to peruse the internet
[365.98s -> 368.98s]  for other people that potentially had the same interests as me
[368.98s -> 370.98s]  and try to find someplace to hang out with maybe other people
[370.98s -> 374.98s]  that were interested in voice acting and talking in general into a microphone.
[374.98s -> 379.98s]  And this is a real testament, guys, as to why the internet is truly a fantastic place.
[379.98s -> 383.16s]  Because without the internet, I don't think I would have ever,
[383.16s -> 388.16s]  ever tried to do any of this stuff or anything to do with talking into a microphone
[388.16s -> 390.16s]  or playing games and talking or voice acting.
[390.16s -> 393.34s]  Plus, on top of that, I've met some lifelong friends
[393.34s -> 397.34s]  from doing this whole voice acting thing and getting involved in the forums and stuff like that.
[397.34s -> 401.34s]  And it's pretty amazing to see because some of these guys are on Cartoon Network right now
[401.34s -> 404.34s]  doing voices for the primetime shows.
[404.34s -> 408.34s]  So it's amazing to know that, it's amazing to meet these people.
[408.34s -> 411.34s]  You're all starting in the same area, you're all trying to help each other out
[411.34s -> 413.34s]  and see where you guys are going to succeed.
[413.34s -> 415.34s]  And watching a lot of these people that I'm friends with
[415.34s -> 417.34s]  succeed to a level that they are right now,
[417.34s -> 420.34s]  not only is it a humbling thing to see that,
[420.34s -> 424.34s]  you just feel so good knowing that you have people that you've been friends with for a while
[424.34s -> 427.83s]  that have been trying so hard that are succeeding in something.
[427.83s -> 430.83s]  And talking about present day, moving on to where I am now,
[430.83s -> 432.83s]  doing this kind of talking into a microphone over gameplay
[432.83s -> 437.01s]  and doing even stuff like comedy videos and skit videos and stuff like that.
[437.01s -> 441.01s]  All the knowledge that I have gained from doing the voice acting thing for so long,
[441.01s -> 444.01s]  editing audio files, editing video files,
[444.01s -> 447.01s]  going to college and learning about production value
[447.01s -> 450.01s]  and learning all sorts of things, meeting more friends, meeting more people.
[450.01s -> 453.01s]  That's kind of how I got to right here, guys.
[453.01s -> 457.01s]  If I had never done any of these things, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you right now.
[457.01s -> 461.01s]  And I would say with the utmost bottom of my heart, complete sincerity,
[461.01s -> 465.01s]  if you have an idea or if you have something you've always wanted to try
[465.01s -> 468.01s]  and you never did it and maybe you're sitting on it right now,
[468.01s -> 474.01s]  stop right now, click this video, click pause on this goddamn video and go do it now.
[474.01s -> 477.01s]  Don't wait any longer, go do it now.
[477.01s -> 479.01s]  Because I've talked about this before, guys.
[479.01s -> 484.01s]  I spent years doing absolutely nothing.
[484.01s -> 486.01s]  And if I look back, I can look back to myself, my old self,
[486.01s -> 489.01s]  if I had a friggin' time machine, I would go back there
[489.01s -> 493.01s]  and I would kick myself in the ass so hard that I would have puked rainbows.
[494.01s -> 498.01s]  I would have made myself get off my ass and do stuff four or five years ago.
[498.01s -> 502.25s]  So take my advice on this, guys. If you have something you want to try, try it now.
[502.25s -> 504.25s]  Do it tonight. Start it tonight.
[504.25s -> 506.94s]  So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[506.94s -> 509.94s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[509.94s -> 512.94s]  Again, link in the description for Galactic Fantasy Prelude.
[512.94s -> 515.94s]  And I will keep you guys up to date if I do any more voice acting
[515.94s -> 520.94s]  or if I do any more paid jobs, I guess, or if I'm in another video game or something like that.
[520.94s -> 522.94s]  I'll keep you guys in the loop.
[522.94s -> 525.94s]  So thank you again so much for watching. I'll see you guys all next time.
[525.94s -> 527.94s]  Of course, take care, everybody.
