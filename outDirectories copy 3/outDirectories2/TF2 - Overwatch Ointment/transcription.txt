[4.92s -> 12.17s]  Is this really happening right now? Am I about to record a Team Fortress 2 video on this channel?
[12.17s -> 20.20s]  Wow. Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[20.20s -> 27.37s]  It's been a while since you've seen TF2. It's been a long time. And why am I doing it now?
[27.37s -> 33.88s]  Why have I decided randomly right now to make this TF2 video? It's because I just played Overwatch.
[34.14s -> 38.54s]  I just got back from the Blizzard event where they showcased Overwatch to a bunch of people.
[38.54s -> 42.38s]  I was one of the people that were there. It was a pretty cool event. Got to play the game for a few
[42.38s -> 48.52s]  hours. Sat down with it. It's really fun. And now I want to play TF2 again. And sort of the unintended
[48.52s -> 54.97s]  consequences of going to the Blizzard event was there aren't very many games like this that are
[54.97s -> 62.25s]  on the market right now. And getting that initial taste of Overwatch got my juices going for TF2.
[62.25s -> 67.75s]  Which is a really good thing. That means that Overwatch impressed me enough where it got me
[67.75s -> 73.88s]  to want to play at least a similar game because I want to play more Overwatch. So we're going to
[73.88s -> 79.00s]  break this down very, very quickly, very easily. I'm not going to go over gameplay mechanics.
[79.00s -> 83.16s]  I'm not going to talk about how many knots per second this character moves at sea level.
[83.16s -> 91.35s]  I'm just going to say one, one, one thing. I keep getting this intermittent rash that I cannot ever
[91.35s -> 94.95s]  get rid of. And I always try to use different products. And you know the type of rash I'm
[94.95s -> 99.11s]  talking about? It's on your back. It's in a really weird spot where your left hand has to come
[99.11s -> 103.59s]  wrapping around your body and try to scratch it. Your right hand then swoops around and you reach
[103.59s -> 106.71s]  down and you're barely touching your two fingers. But you can't get it. And God did that. I got to
[106.71s -> 109.75s]  go to the doctor now. You go to the doctor. You walk in. The doctor prescribes you Team Fortress
[109.75s -> 114.39s]  2. You go down. Team Fortress 2 clears up the rash. You're smearing that TF2 all over the rash.
[114.39s -> 118.87s]  And it's filling. It's scary. You're using a lot of the Team Fortress 2 tube. An antimonth though.
[118.87s -> 123.03s]  And after like three or four years, you run out of the ointment. You go to the doctor. The doctor
[123.03s -> 127.51s]  says, oh geez, you got it. I'm running out of that TF2 medicine. I take it. This is all I got left.
[127.51s -> 131.35s]  It's another two-year supply. You take that two-year supply. You're like, yes, I'm so fucking glad you
[131.35s -> 136.47s]  rub it more. The rash is deceding. It's going away. And then the rash comes back up even worse
[136.47s -> 139.59s]  after that. And you go back to the doctor. The doctor says, I don't have any more Team Fortress
[139.59s -> 144.39s]  2 medicine. They just continued that shit in like 2014. And you're like, no, what do I do?
[144.39s -> 148.87s]  This rash is starting to take over my body. It's itchy all over. And then Overwatch comes out and
[148.87s -> 152.47s]  it's a new medicine. And you've seen the ads on TV. You're like, what is this new medicine? I don't
[152.47s -> 155.51s]  like the side effects. Side effects may include stinging and burning initially. And you're like,
[155.51s -> 159.11s]  I don't want to be stinging and burning initially. So you get it. You fucking, you don't even want
[159.11s -> 163.03s]  it, but you get it because, okay, I'll just take it, I guess. You put it on. It stings.
[166.66s -> 172.36s]  And then like a couple hours later, the rash is starting to feel a little better. It's going to
[172.36s -> 177.27s]  go away. It still hurts, but the rash is going away. And look, I don't even, I can't even tell
[177.27s -> 181.77s]  you, dude, the Overwatch might make the rash worse. You know, you get some medications where
[181.77s -> 184.89s]  it makes the thing that you're the problem you're having worse. And you're like, what the fuck? I
[184.89s -> 189.35s]  got this because I had a rash. I didn't get this because I wanted a bigger rash. But then what's
[189.35s -> 194.46s]  going to cure that rash? Nobody knows. And I'm not going to pretend like I do know. I'm not going to
[194.46s -> 197.58s]  pretend to sit here and tell you that Overwatch is going to be the best game ever. That when it
[197.58s -> 203.40s]  releases, it's going to be a 10 out of 10. I don't know that. All I know is it was really fun when I
[203.40s -> 208.71s]  played it. The characters all feel great. Bastion is probably my favorite character out of all of
[208.71s -> 213.59s]  them. If you don't know what Bastion is or what the character is, he's this big goofy robot guy
[213.59s -> 219.03s]  that can turn himself into an immobile sentry. And you find those places, you find those chokes
[219.03s -> 223.77s]  where you know people are going to come through and you just turn into a sentry gun and you get
[223.77s -> 227.93s]  this big shield in front of you to help protect you and teammates and laying down that suppressing
[227.93s -> 233.29s]  fire. It's great. I love being the support characters in games like this. It's one of the
[233.29s -> 239.13s]  reasons why engineer is my favorite class in Team Fortress 2. It's because of the almost indirect
[239.13s -> 243.29s]  help you're giving people. When I build the teleporter or when I build the dispenser as the
[243.29s -> 248.73s]  engineer, I know people are using it, but I'm not making people use it. Like I'm not grabbing
[248.73s -> 254.17s]  somebody by their pant legs and their shirt collar and tossing them over the point to go to B. Like
[254.17s -> 258.57s]  I'm not directly teleporting people. My shit's doing it for me. Same thing with a character like
[258.57s -> 264.25s]  Zenyatta in Overwatch who has this orb that you simply place on somebody. You can only go on one
[264.25s -> 269.22s]  person at a time and it just heals them. You give somebody a personal pocket medic and you don't
[269.22s -> 273.64s]  even need to be near them. You just have to place it on them. But the characters in Overwatch, just
[273.64s -> 278.38s]  like in Team Fortress, have the personalities behind them to make it so you want to play as
[278.38s -> 282.86s]  a certain character. You'll connect with one of these characters just like I did when I first
[282.86s -> 286.94s]  started playing with the spy. I thought I got his spy. I thought he was like the coolest thing ever
[286.94s -> 292.58s]  and I wanted to play spy even though I wasn't that good with spy. I just wanted to hear him talk and
[292.58s -> 296.98s]  that's so huge for me in a game like this. Like the reason why I continue to play TF2, why I like
[296.98s -> 301.91s]  Team Fortress, why I've been playing for as long as I have, it has a lot to do with the personality
[301.91s -> 306.79s]  of the characters. It has a lot to do with the shorts, the source filmmaker videos, the Gmod
[306.79s -> 313.59s]  videos, the comics, the whole world that has been realized around these characters. They're each
[313.59s -> 318.94s]  their own person. They're each their own hysterical awesome character and I really hope that's what
[318.94s -> 323.58s]  happens with Overwatch. I hope Blizzard takes that seriously because we love to see these characters
[323.58s -> 328.78s]  play out situations and be sort of these living breathing people when in fact they're just kind
[328.78s -> 334.15s]  of mercenaries that are playing in a multiplayer shooter game. Now however you feel about Overwatch,
[334.15s -> 337.27s]  if you think it's going to be terrible, if you don't like it looks, if you think it's too much
[337.27s -> 343.43s]  like TF2 or whatever, at least it's trying to do it. At least it's trying to fill a potential void
[343.43s -> 349.19s]  that TF2 will inevitably leave behind. When is that going to happen? I don't know. I don't know,
[349.19s -> 353.83s]  it could happen tomorrow, it could happen next year, it could happen ten years from now, but
[353.83s -> 360.23s]  that's the problem with the Team Fortress series. It is covered in this gigantic shroud of the
[360.23s -> 365.30s]  unknown. We don't know where the direction of the series is going. We don't know what they're going
[365.30s -> 369.94s]  to be adding. We don't even know if there's going to be another installment in this series. We just
[369.94s -> 375.06s]  get the stuff that Valve gives us whenever they deem it necessary to give it to us.
[375.06s -> 379.78s]  That's it. That's just the way it's always been and that's the way apparently it's going to be.
[379.78s -> 385.78s]  But it's just refreshing to see a company like Blizzard that has the money and has the experience
[385.78s -> 392.07s]  making games stepping up to the plate and taking a swing. And I'll parrot what I said in the
[392.07s -> 396.94s]  beginning. I'll end this video simply by saying the time that I spent with it was pretty damn fun.
[397.02s -> 402.54s]  I'm starting to get more interested in it than I was before. And even if it's not the rash cure
[402.54s -> 408.49s]  that I initially think it's going to be, I'll find another fucking prescription. But we'll leave it
[408.49s -> 413.21s]  at that. Just know that I don't want to overhype it for myself. I made the overhype video. I'm
[413.21s -> 416.81s]  getting excited. I don't want to get this excited about it, but I'm starting to get excited. I don't
[416.81s -> 419.93s]  know what to do. Somebody please help me. I'm getting too excited for Overwatch. Somebody come.
