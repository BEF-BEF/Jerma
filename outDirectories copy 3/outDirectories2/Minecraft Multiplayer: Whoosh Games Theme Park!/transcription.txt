[0.31s -> 19.40s]  What? What? The lone cow and the endless plains. What are you doing out here, man? Don't look at me like that.
[19.40s -> 28.90s]  I'm gonna mess you up, cow. Eat the raw meat. Eat the raw meat. Alright, let's go. I got leather.
[28.90s -> 37.72s]  And jump with joy because we're going to a crazy awesome theme park. We're going to the carnival.
[37.72s -> 42.72s]  Going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. I can't contain my excitement for the carnival.
[44.72s -> 50.26s]  Okay, that's enough. Oh my god, I'm so excited. We're gonna go play carnival games.
[50.26s -> 56.26s]  Welcome to Woosh Games theme park. At the entrance of every game, you'll find descriptions.
[56.26s -> 61.26s]  What am I doing? Why am I like, I'm like looking, I can't, how do I get back to first person?
[61.26s -> 66.57s]  It's F, it's like F5 twice. Oh, okay, because I was like looking at myself like a bird.
[67.57s -> 78.26s]  Alright, so what's the rules? Alright, each, ow. Why you do that, man? I don't know. Read the rules, man.
[78.26s -> 86.96s]  Alright, you read the rules. I'll look. Did you, are you making the piano chirp? No. Do you hear that?
[86.96s -> 93.14s]  There's a bird in here. Is this like the clerk? Oh, he's the one doing it.
[93.14s -> 100.00s]  Like, can I order a double cheeseburger? Alright, cooked chicken, steak, or cake?
[100.00s -> 106.91s]  Uh, no double cheeseburgers. Goodbye. Goodbye, McCrafty's.
[106.91s -> 111.41s]  I'm taking a cake. So do you just want to start, start and go down the row?
[111.41s -> 113.41s]  Let's just go down the row, man. Let's do it.
[113.41s -> 119.65s]  Alright, ride your pig, make it step on the plates so your opponent will be shot. If you kill his pig, you win.
[119.65s -> 123.65s]  Red and blue lines are for the players to spectate, follow the orange line.
[123.65s -> 128.89s]  Alright, you're blue. You take the blue line, you just follow that line. Egg.
[128.89s -> 135.08s]  Okay, so we can hit the pigs, just don't kill your pig, man.
[135.08s -> 142.08s]  So the goal is we're trying to kill each other's pigs, right? Right, the first person whose pig dies loses.
[142.08s -> 150.01s]  Well, I hope you're ready to get destroyed. Oh, he's right here. Ride the pig and press I am ready to start.
[150.01s -> 155.55s]  There's like, how come there's more, there's like three pigs down here? Man, you are cheating hardcore.
[156.55s -> 159.98s]  How many pigs? I don't have any pigs down there.
[159.98s -> 161.98s]  Kill that pig that's in that pen.
[161.98s -> 165.98s]  Oh, now I've got another pig. Okay, now it's even.
[165.98s -> 170.54s]  So how do you put the saddle on the pig? You just right click the pig with the saddle.
[170.54s -> 176.90s]  I can't do it. He's like, he won't let me. I'm on my pig.
[176.90s -> 178.90s]  He's like, this is not, oh, there we go. Okay, I'm on it.
[178.90s -> 181.90s]  And push the button. Ready? I am ready. Go.
[181.90s -> 187.26s]  Uh oh, my pig, my stealthy pig jumped up on top of the mop, so did yours.
[187.26s -> 192.70s]  Wait, let's go pig. Oh, there we go. I'm down. I'm down. I punched him.
[192.70s -> 196.70s]  Oh, I punched my two. Okay, we got to make him step on the pressure plates.
[196.70s -> 199.70s]  Come on pig, me and you. Me and you pig.
[199.70s -> 203.58s]  Kill him. Kill his pig. Yeah, come on pig.
[203.58s -> 206.58s]  Get out of the corner. My pig is hiding in the corner.
[206.58s -> 210.76s]  Did you kill your pig?
[210.76s -> 214.76s]  Hey, looks like you won. Oh, it looks like I did win.
[214.76s -> 217.38s]  Well, I still have this pig. Not for long.
[217.38s -> 225.34s]  The next one. Next game on the menu is piston boxy. Boxy.
[225.34s -> 227.34s]  Why not? I got to throw some trash away.
[227.34s -> 231.34s]  I got some like raw meat to throw away.
[231.34s -> 233.34s]  Yeah, I got like a ton of arrows to throw away.
[233.34s -> 237.27s]  It's just like fire. Lava trash cans.
[237.27s -> 243.34s]  What a practical. Oh, here's your trash cans. It's just actually a lava pit.
[243.34s -> 246.52s]  We need some more recycling cans around here.
[246.52s -> 249.52s]  Make sure like your kid doesn't crawl in there.
[250.52s -> 252.52s]  All right. Okay, two players need it.
[252.52s -> 255.52s]  Avoid punches. Knock your opponent down.
[255.52s -> 258.27s]  Red boxer, brown boxer.
[258.27s -> 261.45s]  It doesn't really matter to me. I'll go brown.
[261.45s -> 265.45s]  Take your pick. So we're supposed to box each other?
[265.45s -> 269.45s]  We're going to be pushing some kind of buttons to box.
[269.45s -> 272.45s]  So it's like rock-em-sock-em robots, except not.
[272.45s -> 275.62s]  All right, so I think I understand. Rock-em-sock-em robots.
[275.62s -> 278.62s]  Okay, fight. Fall into the white blocks is what it says. Okay.
[278.62s -> 283.30s]  I'm in some sort of arena now. So I see you over there.
[283.30s -> 286.30s]  All right. So I think we have to punch each other.
[286.30s -> 288.30s]  Whoever wins, wins, right?
[288.30s -> 290.30s]  Apparently by pushing these buttons on the left and right.
[290.30s -> 292.60s]  You ready? Ready? Go.
[292.60s -> 295.61s]  Oh, I'm going to dodge him.
[295.61s -> 301.87s]  Oh, no, that was coming. No, no. Oh, damn it.
[301.87s -> 304.87s]  I don't know. I think you went off first.
[304.87s -> 306.87s]  Oh, I did go off first. God darn it.
[306.87s -> 311.67s]  All right. Game number three is a PvP game.
[311.67s -> 316.18s]  Players needed at least two dodge arrows.
[316.18s -> 318.18s]  Shoot your opponent. You want to read the rules?
[318.18s -> 321.12s]  Welcome to dodge ball.
[321.12s -> 323.30s]  It's like playing dodge ball, but instead of a ball,
[323.30s -> 327.30s]  you shoot flaming arrows that will push the opponent against lava.
[327.30s -> 328.30s]  How terrible.
[328.30s -> 331.30s]  The player who dies loses the game by pressing the pressure plate.
[331.30s -> 333.30s]  You get bonus items. Okay.
[333.30s -> 336.92s]  So the yellow line is for people to watch.
[336.92s -> 338.99s]  All right. Don't leave your side.
[338.99s -> 340.99s]  I don't want to see cheating from you.
[340.99s -> 341.99s]  Oh, hey now.
[341.99s -> 346.87s]  I resent that slap on my face.
[346.87s -> 348.87s]  All right. Have fun.
[348.87s -> 351.18s]  Are you ready? Do it.
[351.18s -> 354.18s]  Okay. Here we go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[354.18s -> 358.21s]  Are we still taking the armor?
[358.21s -> 359.21s]  I'm still taking the armor.
[359.21s -> 363.11s]  All right. All right. All right. I feel you.
[363.11s -> 364.11s]  Okay. I got this.
[364.11s -> 366.11s]  I got to like hide from you because I don't know what you're doing.
[366.11s -> 370.66s]  Yeah, I see you. I see you.
[370.66s -> 372.66s]  Oh, damn. I don't think so.
[372.66s -> 374.66s]  No. Peek around that corner.
[374.66s -> 376.66s]  Don't hide. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[376.66s -> 379.39s]  See? Oh, give me this.
[379.39s -> 381.39s]  Oh, golden apples.
[381.39s -> 383.39s]  What? What is going on?
[383.39s -> 385.39s]  No. Eat the apple. Eat the apple.
[385.39s -> 386.39s]  No. Eat the apple.
[386.39s -> 388.39s]  Don't. Quit right clicking, you idiot.
[388.39s -> 390.39s]  I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
[390.39s -> 392.02s]  See, I was trying to save.
[392.02s -> 393.02s]  I can see your feet.
[393.02s -> 395.02s]  That's the French part.
[395.02s -> 397.02s]  Hold on. I was trying to save.
[397.02s -> 399.02s]  Oh, God. Eat the apple. Eat the apple.
[399.02s -> 402.58s]  Oh, shit.
[402.58s -> 407.27s]  You see, I was trying to save time by just shooting at you.
[407.27s -> 410.64s]  I didn't put any armor on.
[410.64s -> 415.14s]  So I was trying to sneak attack and shoot you before you put on all your armor.
[415.14s -> 416.14s]  That was so funny.
[416.14s -> 418.14s]  Didn't work out so well, though.
[418.14s -> 420.38s]  As you can see.
