[0.31s -> 18.44s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight gonna be playing with the Huntsman Sniper.
[18.44s -> 29.92s]  Something I haven't done in a pretty long time. I think the last time I played Huntsman was when I was in North Carolina for helping my sister and being there for Thanksgiving.
[29.92s -> 34.92s]  So my goodness, that's been November, December, October. Oh my goodness, it's been a long time.
[34.92s -> 40.16s]  And I actually have a really interesting topic for this video, and it's something I want to talk about, something really cool I was thinking of.
[40.16s -> 48.16s]  And it has to do with, first I'll tell you the loadouts. Loadout's gonna be the Huntsman, the Jurati, and the Bushwhacker.
[48.16s -> 52.16s]  And I kind of feel naked with this setup, because I really like having the Darwin's Danger Shield.
[52.16s -> 58.40s]  And without it, I really do feel like I'm outside naked in my underwear in 20 degree weather.
[59.90s -> 65.90s]  I mean, but honestly though, I just like having that extra bit of security, that extra health to counteract enemy snipers.
[65.90s -> 74.90s]  If I get body shot, I probably won't die. And of course, if a stray rocket comes in and takes me down to 15 health, I'm not gonna die in that situation either.
[74.90s -> 82.90s]  But you're given your take though, because the Jurati is a fantastic item, and I use it once or twice here to get some assists, and to kill somebody with the Bushwhacker.
[82.90s -> 87.90s]  So it goes hand in hand. It doesn't matter what you put on, as long as you're putting something on.
[87.90s -> 91.90s]  Alluding to my naked argument I just made, two-set, whatever.
[91.90s -> 99.71s]  So this commentary is going to very, very, very, very much so focus on primary weapons like the Huntsman.
[99.71s -> 103.89s]  Now I don't mean all primary weapons, or the rocket launcher, or the syringe gun.
[103.89s -> 109.89s]  I'm talking about primary weapons that totally change the direction of a class.
[109.89s -> 119.14s]  I don't think there's any other item in the game, besides the Huntsman, that totally changes the default weapon that is supposed to be there.
[119.14s -> 123.31s]  Now that's the only way I can really describe this. It's the default weapon that is supposed to be there.
[123.31s -> 129.31s]  Let's take for instance a rocket launcher for the soldier. They have rocket launcher, rocket launcher, rocket launcher.
[129.31s -> 133.31s]  There's nothing else besides the rocket launcher for the primary slot.
[133.31s -> 140.55s]  The sniper differs in an amazing way, because of course he has three or four sniper rifles, but he also has this damn thing.
[140.55s -> 147.73s]  And I think it's so amazing when Valve takes some of these items and they create different subclasses with the primary weapons.
[147.73s -> 150.73s]  And I wish I would see it more often.
[150.73s -> 156.73s]  No other class has a weapon like this that totally differs from the default.
[156.73s -> 161.90s]  Like I said, the sniper rifle, sniper rifle, sniper rifle, bow and arrow. Whoa, what?
[161.90s -> 168.08s]  It's amazing. And I kind of wanted to make this video to get some of your guys' responses and some of your feedback.
[168.08s -> 172.26s]  What would you put in this game for some of the other classes?
[172.26s -> 176.50s]  Let's say for instance the heavy. He's got of course the miniguns.
[176.50s -> 179.50s]  So what would you guys in the comments section let me know?
[179.50s -> 187.74s]  What would you give, not only the heavy, but what would you give the other classes to make it sort of like the Huntsman versus the sniper rifles?
[187.74s -> 191.74s]  And I was thinking about this in my bed the other night. I was going, you know, the soldier.
[191.74s -> 198.10s]  The soldier should probably have some type of maybe assault rifle or something like that, or maybe a different type of grenade launcher,
[198.10s -> 200.10s]  or maybe something like that. I was just kind of going all over the place.
[200.10s -> 205.10s]  But it really gets you thinking because they've already done it with the Huntsman and the sniper rifles.
[205.10s -> 208.10s]  There are two totally different weapon classes.
[208.10s -> 216.47s]  And really the only other one I can think of besides the Huntsman is probably the shortstop or maybe even the pompson for the engineer.
[216.47s -> 220.47s]  But those are still kind of in the same category as their default counterparts.
[220.47s -> 224.71s]  So just wanted to throw that out there. And hopefully we see some more of these cool items.
[224.71s -> 227.71s]  Hopefully Valve throws us some more cool stuff.
[227.71s -> 232.08s]  But it just got me thinking and I of course wanted to get your guys opinions because when I'm rolling around in bed thinking,
[232.08s -> 236.08s]  okay, that sounded really bad. Let's redo this.
[236.08s -> 242.08s]  When I'm in various modes of deep contemplation and in undisclosed locations,
[242.08s -> 247.08s]  I like to throw the ideas off people and you guys always bounce back with some really good responses.
[247.08s -> 250.38s]  And I do read every single comment.
[250.38s -> 254.38s]  So if you throw a comment at me and you don't think I'm going to read it or it's too long,
[254.38s -> 258.38s]  and he's not going to read this, I will read it. I read everything.
[258.38s -> 260.38s]  And I can't reply to everybody.
[260.38s -> 265.38s]  And that's just because the sheer amount of people sometimes that leave comments on these videos or in PMs or whatever.
[265.38s -> 271.38s]  But really do keep in mind, I do read every comment and I do appreciate every single one of those comments,
[271.38s -> 274.38s]  whether it be constructive criticism or whether that be something good.
[274.38s -> 276.38s]  I appreciate all of it, guys.
[276.38s -> 283.56s]  And I know already that I'm going to get so many good responses to this particular video question thing.
[283.56s -> 285.74s]  And yeah, I'm looking forward to it, guys.
[285.74s -> 288.23s]  So that is going to wrap up this particular video.
[288.23s -> 291.23s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[291.23s -> 295.23s]  And I forgot to mention, this is a one-life from start to finish,
[295.23s -> 297.23s]  where I complete the entire round without dying.
[297.23s -> 298.23s]  I forgot to mention that.
[298.23s -> 301.23s]  So one-life gameplay is the Huntsman sniper.
[301.23s -> 303.23s]  And I will see you guys all soon.
[303.23s -> 305.23s]  So take care, everybody.
