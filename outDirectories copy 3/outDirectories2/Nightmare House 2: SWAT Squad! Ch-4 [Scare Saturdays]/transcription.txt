[0.31s -> 18.95s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Nightmare House 2 Chapter 4. I probably should not be doing that because I need like the bullets to shoot people.
[18.95s -> 23.19s]  But this is Chapter 4, Operation I think is the name of this particular chapter.
[23.19s -> 30.88s]  You're probably going to see Nightmare House 2 Chapter 5, 6, and I believe 7. I think there's only 7 chapters.
[30.88s -> 39.88s]  You're going to see those more often than only Saturday now. I want to try and get through this series a little quicker so I can do more scary games on Saturdays.
[39.88s -> 46.49s]  So expect more Nightmare House 2 soon. But in the meantime, let's go.
[46.49s -> 52.44s]  Now I remember from last episode, there's a guy right here. No he's not.
[52.44s -> 58.32s]  What? Where is this guy? I swear to God, he was right there last time. Where is he? Where's my light?
[61.67s -> 67.67s]  That guy was right here. Yeah, okay, great. Glitching out of the side of the wall there.
[67.67s -> 81.63s]  Alright, where the hell am I going? What's going here? It's locked. Looks like there's only one way to go.
[81.63s -> 108.71s]  Hello? Elevator? No, don't work. Straight through here. No, just walk. No, no, this blue area thing. What's going on? What is happening right now?
[108.71s -> 119.86s]  I'm like breathing in gas. Get me out of here. Oh my God, please tell me there's an exit. There is.
[119.86s -> 133.61s]  Do I have like a gas mask or something? I don't think I do. Geez. Breathing in like somebody farted in that hallway. Oh, that was immature.
[133.61s -> 146.44s]  Maybe I can drink the Drano and get immune to it. Nothing even in here. Is this? No, this is like looks... Can I turn this off or something?
[146.44s -> 159.02s]  This looks like where it's originating from. Maybe. Just don't know. What if I shoot it a bunch of times? That's not going to do anything now, is it?
[159.02s -> 170.87s]  Okay, I have to go back out into like the gas room. Why am I stuck? Get out of my face.
[174.56s -> 189.17s]  About what? What? Oh my God. What a troll. Since when does this lady decide she can do that to me?
[189.17s -> 193.90s]  I thought she was like an automated hospital thing.
[199.09s -> 201.09s]  Okay, yeah.
[203.09s -> 215.54s]  I'm not contacting the main desk. I'm breaking into somebody's room and stealing their bed pan. I need to recharge the flashlight.
[215.54s -> 224.98s]  Somebody's bed is gone. I don't know why, but there's nothing in here. Let's keep going.
[224.98s -> 240.28s]  This one? Anything in here? Oh, wow. This was a failed operation. If I do say so myself. Bullets, that's a good thing.
[240.28s -> 256.86s]  Hey, how are you, doctor? You are taking way too many hits than you should. Just go down. Only one place to go. Are you serious?
[256.86s -> 269.05s]  What? My God. Oh, it's all about tapping the... I'm out of bullets. I can't even... I'm out of bullets right now. I just said, I'm out of bullets.
[269.05s -> 281.58s]  Are you telling me I'm out of bullets right now? This is great. I only have three shots in this thing. Great. Fantastic.
[281.58s -> 289.18s]  That was a bad idea. You know what? When I shot those bullets in the very beginning, that was a huge mistake.
[289.18s -> 294.42s]  Because it's going to be like a mini boss. I'm going to have to kill him. It's going to take two or three bullets that I don't have.
[294.42s -> 307.31s]  Can this elevator work yet? Where the hell am I supposed to go? Yeah, I knew that was going to happen. I already knew that was going to happen.
[307.31s -> 314.31s]  You fooled me once. Shame on you. Fooled me twice. Shame on you again. Because you shouldn't be being mean to people like that.
[314.31s -> 326.58s]  And what's in that vent? Definitely have to go in that vent, but I'm not going to do it yet. I want to go down here first. Yep, it's locked. I could have guessed.
[326.58s -> 334.79s]  Vent time. And we all know how much I love going into vents. I love it. It's my favorite thing in the world.
[334.79s -> 346.66s]  Here we go. Vent time. If I can even get in there. Jump in there. Can I pick up one of these stacks of beds?
[346.66s -> 362.25s]  You, bed. Go over there. Get up. Will you just fall over there? Oh wait, there's a chair. I can do this. That's much easier.
[362.25s -> 371.94s]  Alright, here we go. Get the gun out. Because this chicken bone is going to attack me.
[375.03s -> 387.43s]  I hate vents. Can I open this? Nope. Even my character is going...
[387.43s -> 403.29s]  God! Is he dead? What's he doing? We're like having a tea party. Oh, my whole face hurts from that.
[403.29s -> 415.80s]  Let's go. Am I going to drop down here? Not. Should I? What was that? There were just two dudes right there.
[415.80s -> 423.06s]  Should I keep going or should I drop down? I don't know. But I'm going to go this way just because...
[423.06s -> 433.44s]  What the hell is going on? What just hit me? What is going on? Am I stuck in here now? Where am I?
[433.44s -> 451.21s]  What is happening? Why am I sandwiched in here now? Am I here for eternity? I think I'm locked in here forever.
[451.21s -> 462.07s]  No, I'm not. I'm just an idiot. So I do have to go down here. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Break it.
[462.07s -> 476.54s]  You might be a fat guy. You can break through this, can't you? So what am I supposed to do? Go back? I can't even go back.
[476.54s -> 491.00s]  What is happening right now? It's like a maze. Do I put my hands on this to put my name on there?
[491.00s -> 499.86s]  Okay, so now it really is just messing with me. I thought for a second that things were wrong and they were.
[499.86s -> 507.11s]  No, back down in here, I assume, the place where I can't see anything. Isn't this where all the walls were closing in on me?
[507.11s -> 512.91s]  What's going on? Oh, my God. It's so dark in here. I have no idea what's going on. Please get me out of here.
[512.91s -> 527.54s]  I can't even. I can't. I bet you you guys can't. Hi. All right. Good. Friends.
[527.54s -> 544.63s]  Okay. So I'm a patient of this hospital. At least I got like a crew now.
[544.63s -> 552.54s]  Before it was just me and some dumb doctor that didn't do anything. These guys are like SWAT team.
[552.54s -> 562.63s]  All right. Don't worry, bro. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's take out some zombies. Four guys. Oh, this is a squad.
[562.63s -> 570.74s]  Let's all go, buddies. You're all my friends. Look at all my friends, all my friends.
[570.74s -> 579.69s]  We're going to have so much fun. We are a squad of friends. At least I feel safer now. Did you hear that?
[579.69s -> 585.94s]  I didn't. It's a flare, though. I'm putting it down. Oh, hang on to that flare. Okay.
[585.94s -> 593.12s]  Good thing you told me that before I activated it. You guys shoot. You shoot. I don't want to use my bullets.
[593.12s -> 599.19s]  Yeah. See, I don't have to do anything. I don't. I can hold my fire. These guys can do it all for me.
[599.19s -> 606.93s]  What? What? What do you mean incoming? Oh, you guys have assault rifles. Why? Why are you so concerned?
[606.93s -> 617.46s]  Yeah, I'll light the way. I'm not even going to shoot one time. Oh, fine. I'll shoot. You know what? No, screw that.
[617.46s -> 626.90s]  Oh, these guys. These guys are bad shots. You guys have like automatic shotguns and assault rifles.
[626.90s -> 635.97s]  Maybe I should be shooting because they die. Oh, I think they are. One of them is down. Oh, crap.
[635.97s -> 647.14s]  That's not good. All right. I wait. Oh, that was a zombie. Or was it? I'm confused. Let's go this way. I think.
[647.14s -> 654.84s]  No, it's over here. Bullets, bullets, bullets, but flares everywhere. Yeah. Hey, check out my new fireworks.
[654.84s -> 662.86s]  Sick. Oh, my like frames per second are going down like crazy. My screen is like a lagging like nuts.
[662.86s -> 671.41s]  Which way are we going? This way? No, we're going this way. What the hell was that? It was like a spider.
[671.41s -> 686.92s]  Are we going after the spider queen? No, apparently not. We're going through this door. Get out of here.
[686.92s -> 691.92s]  That was a pretty, if I do say so myself, that was a pretty good reflex headshot. That was pretty sick.
[691.92s -> 699.62s]  No, take that out. I want my regular gun, but I don't want to shoot any bullets because I don't want to waste them.
[699.62s -> 713.19s]  Nice job, Jerry. It is all quiet. OK, I got to name these guys. Jerry, Steve, Rick and Dugan. Let's go.
[713.19s -> 726.61s]  Hey, watch out, Dugan. I'm definitely going to forget those names and call them to completely different things later.
[726.61s -> 735.54s]  I knew that. I knew I knew I wasn't going to get to that door. I knew it. His name was Dugan. All right.
[735.54s -> 754.62s]  Let me look around. It's an empty open room. Oh, what's up there? Grab his gun. Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
[754.62s -> 765.36s]  Oh, it's these things. Finally, I get to see them. These little freaks. Oh, what are these things?
[765.36s -> 773.68s]  God, these things are wicked freaky. What is this? I'm running out of ammo with this.
[773.68s -> 781.93s]  Probably shouldn't be just spraying all over the place. But you know what? You only live once.
[781.93s -> 791.58s]  I'm right. I don't know. Don't use those bullets. Just attack. Where am I? Oh, it's this stupid zombie.
[791.58s -> 803.64s]  Shoot him. Shoot this guy. What a way to just burn through bullets. Who did I lose? Did I lose Rick? What's going on?
[803.64s -> 807.46s]  What's going on? Oh, my God. There's so many. Where did he go?
[807.46s -> 825.03s]  Well, yeah, you go ahead. Run out of the room and leave me here for dead. Thanks a lot, guys. Oh, there's only one of you.
[825.03s -> 831.49s]  Hey, find a way to meet us, even though it's only one of you. I got the rest of you killed because I'm an idiot.
[831.49s -> 846.98s]  I'm running around swinging an axe. Let's go down here. I guess I think where am I?
[846.98s -> 855.62s]  Down below the depths of hell. Chapter five. OK. Well, that was pretty intense.
[855.62s -> 859.62s]  A little gunfight there at the end. Thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.
[859.62s -> 864.86s]  And like I said, chapter five is going to be probably in the next couple of days.
[864.86s -> 868.86s]  I want to get through this playthrough sooner than every week. You'll see another episode soon.
[868.86s -> 873.86s]  So, yeah, hopefully there's no jump scare right here in the very beginning. Oh, there is probably.
[873.86s -> 876.86s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys all soon. And of course, take care, everybody.
[876.86s -> 879.86s]  Oh, it's hot out. I got to get like some breeze from the fan.
