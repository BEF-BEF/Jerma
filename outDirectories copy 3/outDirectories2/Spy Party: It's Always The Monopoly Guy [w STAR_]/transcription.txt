[3.06s -> 9.08s]  Oh, you know, you could be this guy with the book too. This like, Monopoly man. You're the fucking Monopoly man.
[13.77s -> 14.77s]  Nope, it wasn't me.
[14.77s -> 16.20s]  What?
[24.35s -> 26.35s]  I'm pretty good at these things, I think.
[26.35s -> 28.35s]  Well, you know, I'm going to know what they are.
[28.35s -> 29.35s]  Yeah, I know.
[29.35s -> 31.04s]  That's fine.
[31.04s -> 32.04s]  I'm picking my spy.
[32.04s -> 37.44s]  Alright, I'm ready.
[37.44s -> 43.46s]  Are you?
[43.46s -> 46.46s]  Because you're going to pick the Monopoly guy now. I'm going to see the Monopoly guy.
[46.46s -> 48.46s]  Why would I be that stupid?
[49.30s -> 56.13s]  Oh yeah, let me pick the guy that you would just... Yeah, that's a great idea.
[56.13s -> 57.13s]  I'm looking, I'm looking.
[57.13s -> 61.90s]  It's so scary. It's so scary because I can see the laser.
[61.90s -> 62.90s]  Is it on your head?
[62.90s -> 66.27s]  No, I can just see it. I can see the laser.
[66.27s -> 69.27s]  I know. Well, if you see the laser on your head, the Monopoly guy.
[69.27s -> 82.34s]  I can see the laser pointing into the room. That's all I'm telling you right now.
[82.34s -> 83.34s]  I'm so scared.
[85.35s -> 87.35s]  No, don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.
[90.32s -> 92.32s]  Playing the psychology role.
[92.32s -> 96.32s]  Oh yeah. Well, I'm going to get you. I think I've already got this figured out.
[97.16s -> 98.16s]  You should be scared right now.
[98.16s -> 99.16s]  Oh yeah?
[99.16s -> 100.16s]  You should be whimpering.
[101.16s -> 103.30s]  Fuck!
[103.30s -> 106.30s]  If that's the indicate. These guys are all suspected double agents, okay?
[107.60s -> 112.76s]  So that means you're over here somewhere. You're in this crowd somewhere.
[112.76s -> 115.58s]  Of course I'm in. This whole room is a crowd.
[115.58s -> 118.58s]  No, no, no. You're in this crowd like over on the right.
[118.58s -> 123.12s]  Because these guys were suspected. They were suspected criminals.
[123.12s -> 127.32s]  And you're over here. You're one of these four people.
[127.32s -> 129.32s]  How could I possibly be one of these four people?
[129.32s -> 133.71s]  Because I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.
[134.55s -> 135.55s]  I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.
[135.55s -> 136.55s]  Who wears mustard?
[137.86s -> 138.86s]  I got my eye on you.
[139.86s -> 140.86s]  I got my eye on the mustard jacket.
[143.18s -> 144.18s]  Okay, now you said I'm out of here.
[145.18s -> 146.18s]  Which means you have to be one of these people.
[147.18s -> 148.18s]  Because how would you have known he even walked away?
[149.62s -> 151.62s]  Oh, that's right. I just figured it out.
[153.82s -> 155.82s]  You're one of the guys in the mustard colored jacket.
[157.82s -> 159.50s]  Okay.
[159.50s -> 161.50s]  I don't know which one of them you are, but I know.
[161.50s -> 162.50s]  Or you're the lady.
[163.68s -> 164.68s]  All right, great. Everybody else out.
[164.68s -> 165.68s]  I know which one of these guys you are.
[169.77s -> 171.77s]  Yeah, you're that guy. You're definitely that guy.
[172.77s -> 174.52s]  Say your prayers.
[175.52s -> 178.30s]  No!
[178.30s -> 179.30s]  You're not good at this.
[180.30s -> 183.30s]  You were the lady. I knew you were one of those guys or you were the lady.
[183.30s -> 184.30s]  Oh, no.
[185.30s -> 189.01s]  You're going to be the freaking monopoly guy again.
[190.01s -> 195.17s]  You're just going to play with the monopoly guy every single time.
[196.17s -> 199.37s]  This is a poker game. I'm not going to give you any tells.
[202.27s -> 203.27s]  Are there even 16 different party goers?
[204.27s -> 205.27s]  I don't know. It looks like there are.
[206.27s -> 207.77s]  I'm taking the shot.
[210.13s -> 212.13s]  I was the monopoly guy.
[215.13s -> 217.13s]  I should have shot the monopoly guy.
[220.80s -> 221.80s]  I should have shot the monopoly guy.
[222.80s -> 225.80s]  Yeah, you really should have because it would have been like the monopoly guy.
[227.10s -> 228.10s]  Like it is every single time.
[230.18s -> 233.18s]  Seriously, better not pick him again. It's not going to work.
[237.55s -> 239.55s]  Hmm. This is tricky.
[240.55s -> 241.55s]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[249.45s -> 250.45s]  I have my suspicions.
[252.33s -> 253.33s]  Screw your suspicions.
[254.17s -> 257.24s]  My suspicions are squabbling.
[258.24s -> 261.78s]  You don't have very much time.
[262.78s -> 265.47s]  You haven't completed your missions. There's no way you have.
[266.47s -> 272.64s]  Okay. Okay.
[273.64s -> 276.94s]  Screw you, monopoly guy. I don't think it's you, but screw you.
[277.94s -> 278.94s]  Are you kidding?
[279.94s -> 286.15s]  Oh, you made him the double agent.
[287.15s -> 291.48s]  This is a weird stage. I'm in the middle. I can't move.
[292.48s -> 293.48s]  Really?
[296.70s -> 297.70s]  Someone's already in...
[298.70s -> 299.70s]  That can't be you.
[301.10s -> 302.10s]  Because that's the double agent as well.
[303.10s -> 306.30s]  You can think whatever you want, bro.
[307.30s -> 308.30s]  You can think whatever you want, bro.
[309.30s -> 310.30s]  You want to know what I think?
[311.30s -> 312.30s]  What do you think? Let's see it.
[313.30s -> 314.30s]  I think there's a lot of statues here.
[315.30s -> 316.30s]  There are a lot of statues here, I guess.
[317.30s -> 318.30s]  You know what, Terma?
[320.06s -> 321.06s]  Safety is off.
[322.06s -> 323.06s]  What do you mean the safety is off?
[324.06s -> 326.96s]  Safety is off.
[327.96s -> 329.65s]  Oh, you're going to shoot that guy?
[330.65s -> 331.65s]  Do it. Shoot that guy right now.
[332.65s -> 333.65s]  Shoot him.
[334.49s -> 335.49s]  Shoot him. Shoot him right now.
[336.49s -> 337.79s]  Shoot that guy right now.
[338.79s -> 339.79s]  Shoot him in the head.
[341.54s -> 342.54s]  No.
[343.54s -> 345.04s]  I'm taking my time.
[346.04s -> 347.04s]  Blow that guy's fucking head clean off his shoulders.
[348.04s -> 349.04s]  Who's this lady?
[350.04s -> 351.04s]  Pay attention to the other guy.
[352.04s -> 353.04s]  Pay attention to that guy.
[354.04s -> 355.04s]  No, that lady didn't do anything.
[356.04s -> 357.04s]  That lady's going the other way.
[358.04s -> 359.04s]  See? I'm telling you this lady's going this way.
[368.34s -> 369.34s]  Man.
[370.34s -> 371.34s]  That guy's just like, I'm just staring at you.
[372.34s -> 388.62s]  Why don't you shoot me?
[391.91s -> 393.54s]  What is about to happen?
[394.84s -> 395.84s]  Everything.
[396.84s -> 404.61s]  Everything is about to happen.
[405.98s -> 406.98s]  You ready?
[408.60s -> 409.60s]  I'm ready.
[410.60s -> 411.60s]  You have to hit accept. Hit accept.
[417.00s -> 419.71s]  I was stretching.
[423.83s -> 424.83s]  He was looking at me right from the start.
[425.83s -> 426.83s]  He was staring right at me.
[427.83s -> 428.83s]  I was like, no.
[429.83s -> 430.83s]  I'm not having this guy show up to no more parties.
[438.55s -> 439.55s]  No, dude.
[444.46s -> 445.46s]  Are you sure it's not him?
[446.46s -> 447.46s]  Look, I'm not...
[448.46s -> 450.27s]  Okay.
[451.27s -> 452.27s]  Okay.
[453.27s -> 454.27s]  You're picking him this time though.
[455.27s -> 456.27s]  I know you can't resist.
[457.27s -> 458.27s]  Can we please play around?
[459.27s -> 460.27s]  Yes.
[461.27s -> 464.27s]  Where you do not instantly kill the Monopoly Man.
[466.92s -> 467.92s]  You could just watch my laser.
[471.02s -> 472.02s]  That's fine.
[473.02s -> 476.69s]  That's perfectly fine.
[477.69s -> 478.69s]  Fucking Monopoly Man every time.
[486.52s -> 487.52s]  What's he doing?
[490.87s -> 491.87s]  Just standing over there.
[492.87s -> 493.87s]  He's not doing anything.
[494.87s -> 495.87s]  Too suspicious.
[498.58s -> 499.58s]  All right.
[500.58s -> 501.58s]  I'm not shooting the Monopoly Guy.
[504.94s -> 505.94s]  I'm not going to shoot the fucking Monopoly Guy.
[506.94s -> 507.94s]  Instantly.
[509.37s -> 510.67s]  What?
[511.67s -> 512.67s]  You missed.
[513.67s -> 517.34s]  You missed.
[518.34s -> 519.34s]  You're so bad.
[521.34s -> 522.34s]  You took like a turn too quickly.
[523.34s -> 524.34s]  You had one knob.
[525.34s -> 526.34s]  Was to kill the Monopoly.
