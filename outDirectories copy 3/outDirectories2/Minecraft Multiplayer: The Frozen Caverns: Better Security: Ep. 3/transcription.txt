[0.31s -> 15.65s]  Yeah, there's at least two creepers out there. Yep. And they're like on top of the roof.
[15.65s -> 21.79s]  This was a horrible place to build the house. Whose idea was this? Mine. And mine. I'm gonna
[21.79s -> 27.10s]  build out, see where my name is, guys? Whoa, they're lagging too. That's the worst part.
[27.10s -> 36.74s]  Yeah. Be careful. I'm coming to rescue you. Oh no, they're coming for me. I'm digging
[36.74s -> 43.82s]  straight up, guys. I'm trying to take care of this skeleton over here. Get in here. I
[43.82s -> 46.50s]  might be able to just lure them away. All right, they're coming after me. Both the creepers
[46.50s -> 53.32s]  are after me. This is our time to act. Oh my god. I have, I don't know where to go.
[53.32s -> 60.78s]  Oh jeez. Head towards me. Where are you? I'm digging out. Are you in the original home?
[60.78s -> 65.86s]  Yes, right here. Get in, get in, get in. Oh, the creepers are coming lefter. I got in,
[65.86s -> 70.34s]  I got in the house. All right, are you in? Me too. I'm in the house. We're both in the
[70.34s -> 74.66s]  house. Nice. Oh my god. I'm gonna get away. Oh my god, they're pounding. See how scary
[74.66s -> 78.74s]  that is? Hey. It's terrifying. I need food. I'm dying. Because there are creepers out
[78.74s -> 82.98s]  there too. Hey guys. You guys can't do nothing. We got food. We have food. I'm gonna defend
[82.98s -> 89.31s]  myself, yo. Get these creepers and, oh gosh. What happens if I open the door? Don't open
[89.31s -> 96.49s]  the door. All right, viewers at home, while you were away, we started a lovely weed farm
[97.38s -> 104.81s]  and as a result, wow, thank, why? This is not working at all. Give me food. Chests do
[104.81s -> 111.42s]  not automatically pick that stuff up. Just an FYI. I want those. Where are those? This
[111.42s -> 119.06s]  is real. All right, you get one bread for you. Actually, two bread for you. Om nom nom
[119.06s -> 124.94s]  nom nom nom nom. How's your hunger doing, Jerma? It's all right. Oh, I was gonna open
[124.94s -> 131.86s]  the door. I was just tempted to. And I need to eat. I need food. Yeah, I do. Actually,
[131.86s -> 142.83s]  I got bread. I just gave you one, so. Oh yeah. All right. It's a total bread party. Oh no,
[142.83s -> 150.83s]  no. I didn't mean to do that. I'll take the hit. Oh my god. I have to piss them off. Oh
[150.83s -> 162.11s]  wow. Why did that just happen? Why? Oh my god. They are so good now. What is this? Okay,
[162.11s -> 168.63s]  I'm rebuilding the wall. I'm distracting, but they're everywhere. All right. I didn't
[168.63s -> 174.67s]  know if you right click, you open doors. Oh my god, they're so good right now. Yes. I
[174.67s -> 181.68s]  right click to like throw a snowball at the door and I open the door. All right. I have
[181.92s -> 186.08s]  to make another door. I've got the wall back up, but man, we need a safer way to do this
[186.08s -> 190.84s]  now. They are way too smart. All right. I need to pick up all of our items. Oh my god.
[190.84s -> 197.64s]  Open up. Oh god. Oh, I'm coming for me. Don't worry. I'm here to the rescue. Oh, he's.
[197.64s -> 206.48s]  How did he get inside? He went through my. He went through. Oh my. What is going on here?
[206.48s -> 212.32s]  Hold on. This is this is a secondary entrance now. Lepter dug up. Remember to distract them
[212.32s -> 217.36s]  and then a creeper like dropped out. He went through his hole in order to come down here
[217.36s -> 224.98s]  and attack me. Oh my god. Luckily for me, he only needed one fist punch to die or else
[224.98s -> 230.35s]  they would have exploded our chest. All right. So masterful, you know, movement around the map.
[230.35s -> 235.23s]  All right. So if I if I right click, I don't throw snowballs. Don't do it.
[235.47s -> 242.91s]  Here you go. Hang on. We're going to fix this. Good lesson. Good lesson to learn. Do not right
[242.91s -> 248.51s]  click near a door. I got it. I should make another door for us up top here, though.
[248.51s -> 254.27s]  Here's what I'm going to do. We're going to make like a secondary, secondary door for the
[254.27s -> 259.14s]  to protect the first door. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, we need one door to protect the
[259.14s -> 264.82s]  second door. Exactly. Exactly. All right. So I have a door up here now as well.
[265.14s -> 269.22s]  Like one exit on this side and one exit on this side. You know what I'm saying?
[269.22s -> 273.62s]  Like two exits. Yeah, because if they're on one side banging on the door,
[273.62s -> 282.19s]  then we just go to the other side. Hey, what if they're smarter than that? What do you do then?
[282.19s -> 285.39s]  What a great way. That's a great way to deal with like a Jehovah's Witness.
[288.27s -> 292.99s]  Just make two doors so you can escape to the second door when they knock on the first door.
[296.16s -> 300.14s]  Let's go. There we go. All right. Oh, wait, no, no, don't fill that in. That's where the door is
[300.14s -> 305.10s]  going to be. Oh, yeah. I cut down this tree. I think totally. Yeah, I did. Actually, we could
[305.10s -> 310.67s]  have three doors. We could have one in the front and one on each side. And then it's literally
[310.67s -> 317.47s]  impossible to get back in the house. I can't believe we really are making a door to get into
[317.47s -> 322.03s]  the door. That's so funny. We're making three doors to get in the door. We heard you like doors,
[322.03s -> 328.90s]  so we gave you a door with the door next to another door. Oh, my God. Look at all that snow
[328.90s -> 333.94s]  video. I love how I'm not doing anything. I'm just like watching you guys like build this house.
[333.94s -> 340.29s]  I'm just like, what time is it? What a great voice.
[343.26s -> 351.47s]  Okay. It's granddaddy germs. Now we just need doors. Oh, no, this is off by one. Okay, I'm good
[351.47s -> 361.25s]  now. I'm okay. Oh, did we freeze? We froze. Wait, what happened? Yeah, we froze. I need one more
[361.25s -> 368.21s]  door. Oh, this looks really, really cool. I think we need to up the style a little bit, though. So
[368.21s -> 375.62s]  I'm going to just. I almost feel like I belong here. We'll sacrifice practicality for an uneven
[375.62s -> 384.18s]  house. What are these shenanigans? This isn't allowed. No, if you play Minecraft long enough.
[385.14s -> 392.37s]  Hey, hey, don't we have a lot of glass? Or am I just mistaken? So they can't like punch out
[392.37s -> 400.21s]  windows, can they? Let's hope not. Yeah, I'm hoping not. Do we have any more glass? Yes,
[400.21s -> 405.25s]  absolutely. All right. Well, I have nothing. I can't. I can't let this slide, man. Can't let
[405.25s -> 411.10s]  it slide. I don't know what's going on. Is that thing up there supposed to be like the chimney
[411.10s -> 419.18s]  or something? There's like a little like dongle up top. We have a snow. I'm going to add a
[419.18s -> 424.86s]  glowstone block on top of that. I do have another snow block. Where do you need it? Right in this
[424.86s -> 435.68s]  corner right over here. Hey, guys. Did I make you miss? No, it apparently made Jerma's mistake.
[435.68s -> 442.24s]  Oh, right clicking doesn't do anything. Oh, it's there. It's easy. I think it's I am helping.
[443.81s -> 448.58s]  And you know what we can do? How did you even get up there?
