[0.31s -> 34.20s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with oh my god a Krait unboxing video. It's been a pretty long time since I've done this, but I'm fairly confident that I'm gonna get like 4 unusuals in like the first 10 seconds of this unboxing. No, I'm just kidding. We'll see what happens, guys. Are you ready? We're gonna alternate, by the way. I'm gonna go one normal and then one robo, so here we go. Oh my goodness, I'm so nervous!
[34.20s -> 73.11s]  Krait number 29. What do you got in there for me, baby? Let's let's make it something sick. Strange black box. I like that. Right off the bat, we're starting good. Wait, wait. Yeah. Hold on. I gotta like fix this. I gotta like make this not like all over the place. Hold on a second. All right, this is way better because now when I actually unbox something, it'll go in the right spot. I think at least that's the theory. So we did one of the normal keys. Let's go with a robo Krait, baby. Here we go. Robo Krait number one. I'm sure open it. We're gonna
[73.11s -> 114.34s]  blow through this as fast as I possibly can, by the way, guys. Towering titanium pillar of hats. All right. I didn't have the original pillar of hats, so that's pretty cool. Let's keep going. Gonna go normal, normal, normal, normal. Krait 29. What's in Krait 29? Extinguisher, black box, Islander, and a bunch of other stuff. Let's open it, baby. What do you what do you know about that? Another strange black box. I mean, I can't really complain at this point because I wanted that to begin with. Robo Krait. What are you going to have in this crate? Please have something good. Bootleg base
[114.34s -> 161.11s]  metal Billycock. These all have really complicated names, don't they? Spy hat. That's pretty cool. Here it is. Normal. Go, go, go. Krait 44. Open. Unusual. Strange equalizer. Shit. I wanted something better. Unusual. Battery canteens. What? What the hell is this? Hold on. Oh, it's a canteen replacement. All right. That's pretty cool. See, I know nothing about these Robo Krait, so all I know is that there's hats in them.
[161.11s -> 199.43s]  There could be unusuals, but crazy effects on them. That's all I really know. Strange rocket launcher. 58. I'm sure. It's so nerve wracking. Yes. Yes. Oh, my God. Every kind of yes. This is like the best thing that they came out with in the in the Robotic Boogaloo update. I got it. The heavy. Oh, I want to put this on right now, but I'm like making a video, so I can't really do that. Let's go back. Let's go, go, go, go, go. That thing is fantastic, though. I'm so glad that I just got that hat. That is immediately going on.
[199.43s -> 221.29s]  Strange Scotsman Skullcutter. Making progress here. Making progress. Give me another one like that. Give me a good one. Soldier Sensei. Oh, it's the yellow belt on the head. OK, I get it. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.
[221.29s -> 245.23s]  Crate 45. What you got? Come on. The Dr. Peppa Godge have to help me here. If you want a reaction for that hat, it's just meh. It's OK, I guess. I've been getting some pretty awesome stuff from the Robo Krait, though. For sure.
[245.23s -> 284.07s]  Plumber's Pipe. That's awesome. Keep it going here. 49. Crate 49. Strange Scattergun. A lot of the default strangers. They used to go for a lot, but now they go for pretty cheap, right? Unless they're festive. If they're festive, then forget about it. You're going to spend like 100 bucks on some of those. Isn't the strange festive Medigun like $140? That's insanity.
[284.07s -> 322.22s]  Firewall Helmet for the Pyro. Cool. God, I haven't even dug into the center of this crater of crate madness. Spicycle. Alright, alright. I feel you. Do another Robo Krait. I've done this like a few times. I put my finger on my lip. Awww. Awww. Still kind of cool. Still kind of cool.
[322.22s -> 344.06s]  I did the math out, and to open all these crates, like the actual count... I completely forgot this thing was even in the game. I forgot that this was like an actual item in the game. I just thought this was a new item. That's like how long it's been since I've seen this thing. The Rap Assassin. What the hell was I just going to say, though?
[344.06s -> 366.25s]  Oh yeah, I did like the math. Like for all these crate openings alone, it's like five minutes. Whoa. Palette of crates. Oh, that's cool. I'll just jump in my server right after this and just give those to all the people that are in there. And I got the Grid Iron Guardian for the heavy. Awesome.
[366.25s -> 413.86s]  Pepper Burps. On creating your loot in 3, 2, 1, 0. Defender Kills. Ah, I like that. I will put that on my Sticky Launcher. You got that right. The Virus Doctor. It's like a sewer. It's like a sewer main thing. I feel like the Ninja Turtles are going to pop out of that hat. I'm going to have so many Robo hats after this, I'm not even going to know what to do with these things. Equip them, of course. Jerma, what the hell are you talking about? Strange Pain Train.
[413.86s -> 435.11s]  I can't say I'm particularly excited about that unbox, unfortunately. Oh yeah. I'm actually pretty glad I got this, because that is so stupid. That is like the stupidest thing ever, and I'm so happy that I actually... Friends and loved ones will call you stupid for wearing this hat. See? I told you.
[435.11s -> 479.22s]  Hey moron, your mother will say, but they won't think it's so funny when you win the backwards swimming competition at the Olympics and are later stripped of your medal for cheating. Pretty funny. Pretty funny. Use width. 55. It's unusual. Damn it. Ooh. That's not a damn it. That's actually cool. Nice. Okay. I'm happy with that. I don't think I have one of those. I hope you have something good in this crate. Make it worth my while.
[479.22s -> 517.63s]  Yes. Yes. That's awesome. The HDMI patch. I can't wait to put that on. That is fantastic. Alright, let's get an unusual in this box, right? Because if I get an unusual, it's being given away, and I want to give away a hat, so let's go. I don't want another Strange Pain Train. Did you hear what I just said, TF2Gods? I wanted an unusual hat because I want to give it away. You sorry bastards. Cyborg Stone Helmet. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Alright, let's speed it up here. We've got to speed this up.
[517.63s -> 554.37s]  26. These are the newer ones. These are the newer ones. So we'll see what we get out of these. Modest Pile of Hat. That's pretty cool. I'll take it. Multi-class hats are always welcome in the land of Jerma. Coming down to the last, I think, 20 or so crates. I got another one. I don't want another one. You know what? You know, alright, this is what we're doing. If I don't get an unusual, I'm still going to give away two of these. So if you want a Firewall Helmet, I'm going to pick two random people in the comments section, and two of you guys are going to get
[554.37s -> 597.10s]  this hat. Because I don't want three of them. I really don't want three of these hats. So comment only once, by the way. I'm going to stick with crate 56. I'm probably going to get like five of those, knowing my luck. Okay, I'm down with a Strange Guillotine. If you saw my last video, I'm not that good with it, but I'll still take it. Got another one of these, too. You know what? I'm giving away this one, too, because I don't want doubles. So we'll deal with this when the video is about to end, but I'll go over that when we get to it.
[597.10s -> 641.90s]  But I'm going to be giving away hats in this video. I promise you that. Strange Fire Axe. Get out of town. I don't want a Strange Fire Axe. Shove it up your ass. Yes! This is the thing that hangs around you, right? I'm getting some cool heavy stuff, I will say that. I am getting cool heavy stuff. If there's any consolation to all these crates I'm opening, I will be a decked out Robo Heavy, and that'll be pretty sick. Another hat to give away, because I don't want to. Any doubles are being given away, except for the Stranges. Any doubles are being given away for hats. Something.
[641.90s -> 654.70s]  Another pile of crates and the Texas Tin Gallon. Kind of looks like origami, but you know what? It looks kind of cool. I'll take it.
[654.70s -> 676.74s]  Alright, I gotta like, get ready for this. I gotta get like, prepared. Medics killed. Strange part. Here comes another burp. I gotta get an unusual. Come on. Gabe Newell is not shining down on me right now.
[676.74s -> 692.06s]  Are you kidding me? So I got this and I got two of the actual version of that hat? That's pretty ridiculous, if I do say so myself. I just want an unusual, a good one.
[692.06s -> 702.83s]  Oh, cool. I could probably use that, even though that weapon's pretty... Can I just say that weapon is like, very difficult to use?
[702.83s -> 708.78s]  Because you run out of ammo in like, less than a minute. You're just like, gone. It's all gone.
[708.78s -> 721.45s]  I have two of you. We're gonna have to do some math and figure out how many hats I'm actually giving away, because I have a lot of these right now. I have a lot of doubles. We'll go over that. Like I said previously.
[721.45s -> 740.95s]  What do you got? Strange neon annihilator? I'll probably never use that like, one time, but it's okay to have for your collection purposes, I guess. What do we got? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine? I'm happy about this.
[740.95s -> 765.38s]  The stupid birdcage. Awesome. Only crate 57 remains and 58. No, I don't want another neon align later. Let's go. Speed it up. Let's go. Just open them. Open them all. Quick. Quick. You gotta go quick, because the game knows when you open a bunch of crates at like, once, it's gonna give you an unusual.
[765.38s -> 784.62s]  I got the gibbous. And it gives me the gibbous after that little speech. Son of a bitch. Eh, it's okay. Because I can also craft these hats, too, to make... No, no, no. What am I doing? Cancel.
[784.62s -> 793.88s]  I can craft these hats together and make new hats. Because that's how the world works. When you put two hats in a box and shake it, you get another hat and the other ones disappear.
[793.88s -> 814.44s]  You old baker boy. I don't know. It's not looking so good for an unusual. It's not looking so good for an unusual. Statistically, what the hell is this? Manco painting set comes with samples of a few different colors that are legally speaking...
[814.44s -> 826.13s]  Oh, so it's just a bunch of paints? You just open it and it gives you like a few paints? Alright, cool. That's pretty cool. I'll take it. It's not a friggin' unusual, but I will still take it and use it.
[834.14s -> 853.90s]  Respectless robo glove. Come on. I need an unusual or I'm gonna crush this fucking can. That's still cool, but it's not an unusual. Here we go. Unusual. Stop the chant. Unusual. Unusual. Unusual. Give me a goddamn unusual.
[856.94s -> 879.10s]  Last two crates. Am I going to get an unusual? I can't look. Strange Gerardi. Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching. I really do appreciate it. Here's the last crate, the last robo crate that I have.
[879.10s -> 909.26s]  It is Paladin Crates and Titanium Tyrolean. No unusual, unfortunately, but I am going to be giving away a lot of hats. Let's see. Let's actually do the math here. So I'm going to be giving away. Alright, so to be eligible to get one of these hats, it's going to be two of these are being given away. So one, two, one of the towering pillar, one of the football helmets, and then one of the modest pile of hat.
[909.26s -> 925.43s]  So thank you guys so much for watching. If you want to be eligible for these this giveaway, just write a comment. Please do not comment more than once because it's unfair and I will be watching and I will flip the out if you do that. So thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it and I'll see you guys all next time.
[925.43s -> 934.98s]  No unusual in this unboxing, but you know what you win some and you lose some and sometimes you just freak out because you didn't win a fucking unusual.
