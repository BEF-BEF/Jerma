[0.82s -> 5.70s]  Yo, what's up guys, it's Jerma again. I'm bringing you a quick gameplay commentary.
[5.70s -> 10.94s]  This time I am the Huntsman Sniper on Gold Rush. I made this video specifically to give
[10.94s -> 15.50s]  you guys some real tips and strategies to use with the Huntsman. A lot of people don't
[15.50s -> 18.22s]  know how to aim with it, a lot of people have trouble with it, so I figured I'd make this
[18.22s -> 22.98s]  video giving you real tips and strategies. The first kill is a Spy covered in Girardi
[22.98s -> 27.44s]  in the back. He goes down, which brings me to the first point I want to make about the
[28.00s -> 34.14s]  is timing. You want to make sure that before you shoot an arrow that you hold your mouse
[34.14s -> 39.98s]  button down for at least two seconds. This is incredibly important when trying to get
[39.98s -> 44.26s]  timing down because if you do not have an arrow prepared, you're going to be freaking
[44.26s -> 49.28s]  out and going, oh, I've got to hold it down now. You have to make sure that you have an
[49.28s -> 54.70s]  arrow ready to go before you even think about shooting. It's very, very, very important.
[54.74s -> 58.86s]  The best way to do it really, in my opinion, is to have an arrow ready to go before you
[58.86s -> 64.06s]  even turn a corner. You'll see what happens right here. Watch. Here it comes. See? You
[64.06s -> 68.38s]  have an arrow primed, it's ready to go, there's one in the chamber, and you can just release
[68.38s -> 73.20s]  it when you are comfortable. Being comfortable is the most important thing when using this
[73.20s -> 78.00s]  weapon. Mostly because if you're uncomfortable using the Huntsman, you are not going to make
[78.00s -> 81.76s]  any shots, you're going to miss everybody, and you're going to freak out. You're going
[81.76s -> 84.40s]  to think you're going to have a shot ready to go, you're going to be prepared for it,
[84.40s -> 88.08s]  you're going to see somebody coming, and you're just going to miss because you're not
[88.08s -> 93.18s]  comfortable. Loosen up a little bit, lighten up, get familiar with the weapon before you
[93.18s -> 98.46s]  even try to go into a server. Go into a private server and just take shots at random things,
[98.46s -> 103.70s]  at signs, at bots, make a bot, appear a bot. It's a good way to get yourself comfortable
[103.70s -> 110.23s]  with the weapon. Now, let's talk about arrow placement. Arrow placement fully relies on
[110.23s -> 117.24s]  your ability to predict the path of enemy players. What does that mean? That means that
[117.24s -> 121.60s]  if you can tell where somebody's going to run, not where they're currently running,
[121.60s -> 127.10s]  but where they are going to run, you will succeed immensely with the Huntsman. A good
[127.10s -> 132.50s]  example is up here. See, I just tried to predict the movement of that Demoman. I was wrong,
[132.50s -> 136.98s]  but I still tried. Stationary targets are pretty easy, like this engineer up there,
[136.98s -> 140.70s]  I killed his sentry. But here we go, right here, this is a great example of what I'm
[140.70s -> 145.46s]  talking about. I will freeze it for you, shoot this Heavy, and then watch. Check out where
[145.46s -> 150.54s]  my cursor is in regards to the Heavy. I'm at least four feet in front of him, release
[150.54s -> 155.66s]  the arrow at the right time, and boom, slow motion headshot on the Heavy, and I'm very,
[155.66s -> 159.98s]  very far away. That's what you want to do with the Huntsman. You want to make sure that
[159.98s -> 165.00s]  you lead your targets on, rather than shoot where they are, shoot where they're going
[165.04s -> 170.44s]  to be. A lot of these same techniques can be put into place for the other projectile
[170.44s -> 175.24s]  weapons. These do not work for hitscan weapons, so if you're using the scatter gun or the
[175.24s -> 180.36s]  shotgun, don't, you know, aim five feet in front of somebody. It's only for the projectile
[180.36s -> 185.00s]  weapons, like the rocket launcher, the grenade launcher, the lock and load actually is a
[185.00s -> 189.44s]  good example, too, of leading a target. The syringe gun, too, also is a good example
[189.44s -> 194.93s]  of leading your targets. The final thing I want to talk about in regards to the Huntsman
[195.05s -> 201.29s]  is the spam aspect of this weapon. This, just like the rocket launcher, the grenade launcher,
[201.29s -> 207.65s]  all those spammy spam weapons, this tops them all, because you can get an instant kill if
[207.65s -> 211.93s]  you just spam. That's a nice headshot on that spy, by the way. You can get instant kills
[211.93s -> 216.21s]  by spamming this weapon. See how I'm just shooting into towards their spawn? You will
[216.21s -> 222.11s]  get a lucky headshot. One out of ten times that happens. That's why this weapon has the
[222.35s -> 227.79s]  synonymously named Luxman, is what it's called by a lot of people. A couple of quick kills
[227.79s -> 231.67s]  here, and then I realize we're all going to get in the cart. This engineer gets backstabbed,
[231.67s -> 235.43s]  even though it made the sound like I hit him. That was kind of weird. So we get on the cart,
[235.43s -> 239.19s]  and this is what I'm talking about in regards to spam. This demo man goes down from the
[239.19s -> 243.51s]  Girardia thrown up, and here we go. Spam this arrow over here. I get a headshot on that
[243.51s -> 248.47s]  disguised spy. Another spam headshot right here, and that is a perfectly good example
[248.47s -> 254.73s]  of just murdering people accidentally. And we win the game. Everyone's on the cart. Thank
[254.73s -> 259.07s]  you everybody for watching again. I appreciate it. I hope you got something out of this video
[259.07s -> 263.93s]  because it's how I learned. So hopefully you can learn too, because it's a lot of fun once
[263.93s -> 267.09s]  you know how to use this item. So take care guys. I'll see you next time.
