[0.31s -> 14.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Midnight Launch of Mists of Pandaria.
[14.70s -> 19.70s]  I'm actually here with MLC Stealth Live here. Say hello.
[19.70s -> 22.70s]  Hello, everyone. We're making pandas.
[22.70s -> 27.70s]  We're making pandas. The Mists of Pandaria just literally launched like five seconds ago.
[27.70s -> 33.70s]  It is three o'clock in the morning here right now, so it's very late for me, but still I want to make a panda.
[33.70s -> 41.24s]  Gotta be playing as a monk, the new class in World of Warcraft in this expansion. Found Darian, the race, and let's go, let's make him.
[41.24s -> 44.86s]  Alright, I'm gonna be typical panda color.
[44.86s -> 54.82s]  Dude, I might be like tabby cat panda. Like look at, I look like a cat. This looks like my cat that's in my house right now.
[54.82s -> 56.50s]  That's so funny.
[56.50s -> 61.22s]  That's what I'm doing. Yeah.
[61.22s -> 68.08s]  Alright, is he gonna be a male? Face. Alright, he's gotta have a really stupid face.
[68.08s -> 72.51s]  Female panda looks kind of cute. Not gonna lie.
[72.51s -> 75.94s]  Does it? No.
[75.94s -> 84.17s]  Oh, MLC Stealth loves those female pandas.
[84.17s -> 88.17s]  Alright, let's go back to male. Oh, did I lose it? No, I didn't. Okay.
[88.17s -> 90.92s]  Oh my god.
[90.92s -> 93.42s]  Are there a lot of people here?
[93.42s -> 100.19s]  Oh, hey, hey, look at everybody. I wonder if you guys just installed the game.
[100.19s -> 103.88s]  I just see a thousand people climbing these steps.
[103.88s -> 105.88s]  Dude.
[105.88s -> 108.50s]  Wow.
[108.50s -> 110.50s]  There's so many people here.
[110.50s -> 114.50s]  We all look the same, like ridiculous.
[114.50s -> 117.50s]  Wait, what do I got for my first move? Jab?
[117.50s -> 120.74s]  Look at all these people just practicing.
[120.74s -> 123.74s]  I can't even click on the quest giver.
[123.74s -> 126.71s]  Where is he?
[126.71s -> 130.40s]  Oh, man. Oh, this guy broke the, I wanna hit that thing.
[130.40s -> 134.73s]  Oh, wow. This is cool. Oh, everyone's training.
[134.73s -> 136.73s]  What is this, quickening palm?
[136.73s -> 140.99s]  Oh, man. Oh my gosh.
[140.99s -> 146.68s]  Look how fake this looks. We're all wearing the same armor and it looks ridiculous.
[146.68s -> 148.68s]  Hey, did you see my Winnie the Pooh character yet?
[148.68s -> 153.33s]  What the hell was that? What the hell was that?
[153.33s -> 155.70s]  What the hell was that over there?
[155.70s -> 159.13s]  What just came out of the water? Something enormous just came out of the water over here.
[159.13s -> 161.69s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[161.69s -> 165.50s]  Hold on. Did you see that?
[165.50s -> 167.50s]  No. Where are you? Can I jump down there?
[167.50s -> 168.50s]  I need to add you.
[168.50s -> 173.43s]  Okay, Jerma, I'll give you a hundred dollars if you can find somebody who's not panda monk.
[182.72s -> 187.47s]  Hold on. Oh, I found a priest. I found a priest.
[187.47s -> 195.57s]  Congrats. You're the only panda priest in WoW.
[195.57s -> 197.57s]  In WoW.
[200.06s -> 201.75s]  What?
[201.75s -> 205.75s]  We're supposed to kill trainees in here. There's no way we're getting like a kill for this.
[205.75s -> 206.75s]  Are you serious?
[207.75s -> 210.75s]  Get in here. You're supposed to kill six of them.
[213.38s -> 217.38s]  There's no way. This is impossible.
[221.38s -> 223.38s]  This is just chaos.
[225.19s -> 227.19s]  Wait, did I get hit?
[227.19s -> 230.19s]  Oh my God. Can we just make a raid and just...
[230.19s -> 232.19s]  Oh, wait. Yeah. Nice. Nice.
[232.19s -> 235.19s]  Hold on. Oh my God, dude.
[235.19s -> 239.26s]  Yeah, like you were saying before, I love how this is supposed to be very, very personal.
[239.26s -> 242.26s]  Look at how personal this is.
[243.26s -> 245.26s]  Take a look at how personal this is.
[245.26s -> 249.26s]  I'm being trained by the Shaolin master monk.
[249.26s -> 251.26s]  And he's training like just us.
[251.26s -> 253.26s]  He's just training me right now.
[253.26s -> 257.50s]  I'm being trained, but me and Stealth are the only people in here being trained. It's so personal.
[260.24s -> 262.24s]  I don't even know where we're supposed to take this.
[262.24s -> 269.05s]  Hold on. Burn the Edict of Temperance.
[270.05s -> 274.35s]  I don't know. I love how everyone's doing the same jump down the stairs.
[274.35s -> 277.35s]  It's so... That's one of the most addicting things in Warcraft.
[277.35s -> 279.35s]  It's just jumping down the stairs.
[279.35s -> 280.35s]  Everybody does it.
[280.35s -> 282.72s]  Over the bridge. Right, which bridge?
[282.72s -> 284.72s]  This place is awesome looking.
[284.72s -> 286.72s]  Just hold on. I've got to get into Alt-Z here.
[286.72s -> 288.72s]  I want to... Look at this.
[288.72s -> 291.02s]  This is really, really cool.
[291.02s -> 294.02s]  Alt-Z, huh? Oh, that takes for the HUD.
[294.02s -> 299.48s]  Yeah. I'm going to take a look at some stuff first.
[299.48s -> 301.48s]  Oh, wow. Look at that water. Look at the stream.
[301.48s -> 303.78s]  Everything is so beautiful.
[303.78s -> 306.78s]  So finesse. So wonderful.
[306.78s -> 308.78s]  Yeah, look at this.
[308.78s -> 313.33s]  It's so lovely. I just want to live here all day.
[315.33s -> 317.33s]  Oh my god. What are you doing?
[317.33s -> 319.40s]  Did you die?
[319.40s -> 320.90s]  No.
[320.90s -> 323.90s]  Oh, it is going to be such a pain in the ass for you to get back up here.
[323.90s -> 326.07s]  We've got to wait for the cart driver.
[326.07s -> 328.07s]  I wish there was an AOE move. Just like...
[328.07s -> 330.44s]  Are you ready?
[330.44s -> 332.44s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[332.44s -> 334.44s]  Get it! Get it! Get it!
[336.44s -> 337.44s]  We didn't get it.
[337.44s -> 339.44s]  I didn't get any. Did you get any?
[339.44s -> 341.74s]  Wait, I don't think we were supposed to be killing these.
[341.74s -> 343.74s]  We need to kill those because they have the stone supplies.
[343.74s -> 345.74s]  Oh my god.
[345.74s -> 347.74s]  Get ready again. You ready?
[347.74s -> 349.74s]  Ready? No. Ready?
[349.74s -> 351.74s]  Hold on. He spawns right here.
[351.74s -> 354.24s]  I'm going to seriously just go into first person mode.
[354.24s -> 356.24s]  Get it! Get it! Get it!
[358.24s -> 360.24s]  I didn't get it. This guy beat us.
[360.24s -> 362.24s]  One more time. Third time's the charm.
[362.24s -> 364.67s]  Hold on.
[364.67s -> 366.67s]  This guy's going to help.
[366.67s -> 368.67s]  Here it comes. We've got to get it. We've got to get credit for it.
[368.67s -> 370.67s]  Get it! Get it!
[370.67s -> 372.67s]  Yes!
[372.67s -> 373.67s]  You got that one?
[373.67s -> 375.67s]  No, I didn't.
[375.67s -> 377.67s]  Hit him!
[377.67s -> 382.73s]  Oh my gosh.
[383.73s -> 386.21s]  That's so funny.
[386.21s -> 388.21s]  I can't believe this is how we're doing this right now.
