[3.45s -> 14.95s]  What is up guys? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary, but before I get
[14.95s -> 18.69s]  into that, I want to talk about the breast cancer awareness pictures that
[18.69s -> 23.58s]  you're about to see. Thank you every single person that wanted to participate,
[23.58s -> 28.94s]  that did participate. You guys supported an amazing cause. Thank you so much guys.
[28.94s -> 34.39s]  I was so happy that I filled the server a couple of times. About 50 or 60 people
[34.39s -> 39.15s]  were involved, so thank you so much. Here are the pictures. They came out great.
[39.63s -> 44.31s]  Everybody with a pink hat or a pink miscellaneous item painted. I heard a lot
[44.31s -> 47.15s]  of stories from you guys about how you're having family members deal with
[47.15s -> 50.55s]  breast cancer or you've had to deal with family members with breast cancer. And
[50.55s -> 54.18s]  it's tough. It's tricky for a lot of you guys and I appreciate the fact that
[54.18s -> 58.34s]  everyone came to that server and we all supported it. Everybody that's supporting
[58.34s -> 62.34s]  this whole thing, you guys are all awesome. Thank you. All I can say is thanks.
[62.34s -> 67.01s]  And you're supporting a great cause. So here is the gameplay. A lot of you guys
[67.01s -> 73.72s]  know that the Team Fortress 2 game engine is destroyed right now. So you
[73.72s -> 78.08s]  can't even play. I personally can't play Team Fortress for more than 10 minutes
[78.08s -> 83.48s]  without crashing to my desktop. So I am going to play Orcs Must Die which is a
[83.48s -> 88.96s]  new strategy tower defense hybrid game. Hope you guys enjoy it and hopefully
[88.96s -> 96.40s]  they fix Team Fortress 2 soon so we can all play again. Okay so here we are in
[96.40s -> 100.56s]  Orcs Must Die and I gotta tell you guys this is one of the best games I've
[100.56s -> 104.48s]  played this year. Haven't played a whole lot of games this year but this is
[104.48s -> 108.48s]  definitely topping the charts for me. If you are unfamiliar this game is a
[108.48s -> 113.52s]  hybrid of tower defense and strategy elements in the game. It's amazing. It's
[113.52s -> 117.24s]  really really great. So if you're one of those guys like me that grew up playing
[117.24s -> 123.16s]  Warcraft 3 and playing tower defense on Warcraft 3, you are going to absolutely
[123.16s -> 129.22s]  love this game. It is amazing to a million degrees. So basically what you
[129.22s -> 134.06s]  want to do, I only just started playing this game yesterday, so basically what
[134.06s -> 141.04s]  you want to do is you want to defend this thing over here. It is a little rift
[141.04s -> 144.80s]  area thing and you got this guy here that can protect it with you. But this
[144.80s -> 148.08s]  thing right here has to be protected and these doors over here if you look at the
[148.08s -> 151.80s]  top right of the screen, this door is going to open and this door down here is
[151.80s -> 156.36s]  going to open as well. What's going to happen is orcs, hundreds and hundreds of
[156.36s -> 161.04s]  orcs are going to pour out of those places and you have to defend them. You
[161.04s -> 166.15s]  have to kill them all or else they're going to take that over. So how do you do
[166.15s -> 171.50s]  this? One way is with your crossbow. You can shoot it like this. It has a couple
[171.50s -> 175.26s]  of little features too. You can do like a stun where it stuns them in place but
[175.26s -> 178.46s]  the cool part about this game and why it's sort of like tower defense is
[178.46s -> 182.54s]  because you have all these things you can put down. So I have started to
[182.54s -> 187.98s]  upgrade or I've already upgraded this poison spike trap and I use the super
[187.98s -> 190.46s]  boom barrel but I'm not going to use that right now because I'm going to use
[190.46s -> 194.14s]  the arrow walls but you can as you can see customization is really really
[194.14s -> 197.26s]  interesting in this game and look at how many spells you're gonna actually end up
[197.26s -> 200.58s]  getting. It's a whole lot of fun and yes you'll see what I'm gonna do here is
[200.58s -> 206.31s]  place a couple of spike traps over here. They're gonna come from this way too so
[206.31s -> 212.63s]  let's go over this way too. Bang, bang and this guy just got this guy. I don't know
[212.63s -> 216.18s]  what the hell he does. We're gonna put him right here though and we're gonna
[216.18s -> 221.50s]  put this guy rotate with R. Okay so as you see these guys are gonna shoot the
[221.50s -> 225.86s]  orcs that come down the hallway so let's unleash the horde and look at the top
[225.86s -> 228.06s]  right of the screen you can see where they're coming from. They're coming from
[228.06s -> 233.10s]  right here so let's get them. The cool part about this game guys is you can
[233.10s -> 237.42s]  string together combos and headshots and stuff like that. It is a very very fun
[237.42s -> 241.38s]  game. I gotta tell you right now like I said before it's one of the funner games
[241.38s -> 245.74s]  I've ever played and I've played a lot of games like this and this one is one
[245.74s -> 250.52s]  of the ones that takes the cake. It's awesome. Oh my god stun him. These
[250.52s -> 254.60s]  orcs are actually pretty sick. Oh they can get killed. I did not know that. I did
[254.60s -> 259.88s]  not know that. So yeah that's the first wave so as you'll know if you play tower
[259.88s -> 264.00s]  defense before you have multiple waves to deal with and you have a few
[264.00s -> 268.92s]  seconds between each wave so let's uh oh god put a couple more spike traps here.
[269.80s -> 277.54s]  Oh boy gotta go gotta go gotta go. Oh my god. Oh you know I'm gonna I need those
[277.54s -> 282.58s]  archers are sick. I need more of those archers. Oh boy this is not looking good
[282.58s -> 287.29s]  right now. I'm being really inaccurate. See if you look at the crosshair the
[287.29s -> 292.97s]  crosshair oh god stun him. The crosshair will shrink. It's kind of like in if you
[292.97s -> 296.77s]  know Team Fortress but oh they're killing my archers. In Team Fortress when
[296.77s -> 300.29s]  you are shooting the gun like with the ambassador let's just say for instance
[300.29s -> 304.05s]  if you have the ambassador. It's very very accurate on the first shot and you
[304.05s -> 310.05s]  see I'm collecting headshots right here. Bang bang bang bang bang bang me a bunch
[310.05s -> 315.77s]  of headshots baby. So it's kind of you get more inaccurate the more you shoot
[315.77s -> 319.81s]  and that's it for that wave. I gotta put some more archers down and the money is
[319.81s -> 325.88s]  in the lower right. So these cost 600. I'm gonna you know let's do this. They're
[325.88s -> 330.76s]  probably gonna come from the other side. Let's do this. You can't get my
[330.76s -> 333.44s]  impenetrable. Oh yeah they're coming to the other side. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna
[333.44s -> 335.80s]  have my archers shoot that way and I'm gonna shoot these guys coming around
[335.80s -> 341.21s]  here. See if that works out. Oh god the little freaks they run fast. Alright cool
[341.21s -> 346.68s]  cool. Stop where you're going right now brother. So there's a whole lot of
[346.68s -> 350.92s]  strategy and you can play this game a million different ways. I am selecting my
[350.92s -> 355.04s]  way I'm doing my own thing but you can do your own thing. There's endless
[355.04s -> 359.36s]  possibilities guys. It is a whole lot of fun. Highly suggest you pick this game
[359.36s -> 366.12s]  up. It is only 15 bucks. So yeah that is completely and totally worth it. So now I
[366.12s -> 371.28s]  have a break. I have a couple levels left to do. Let me pull out my you know what
[371.28s -> 375.88s]  I'm gonna keep this going. Let's keep these archers here. Let's do a ton of
[375.88s -> 382.80s]  archers. Oh baby. You think you're gonna get by this? I got my crew with me. My
[382.80s -> 389.06s]  crew are mad archers. Oh let's do it. Unleash the horde. Where they coming from?
[389.06s -> 393.38s]  Yeah I'll go I'll go this way again and they'll take out that other side. Oh let me
[393.38s -> 401.66s]  bang some headshots. Oh boy. Nice. Nice. How they doing? Okay they're doing
[401.66s -> 405.62s]  alright. They're doing alright. I better go over there and assist. No I don't
[405.62s -> 410.14s]  they don't even need me. They don't even need me. Okay yeah I might need some help
[410.14s -> 416.90s]  over here though. Unfortunately guys there is no co-op in this game. I really
[416.90s -> 421.42s]  wish there was. I really do. Because this would be so much fun with two or three
[421.42s -> 427.22s]  people. Oh my god. I'll be alright. I'll be alright. Come on let me let me just bang
[427.22s -> 432.09s]  some headshots on you guys. You can also pull out your staff or your sword
[432.09s -> 436.21s]  whatever it is. I don't have it equipped because I don't really use it to be
[436.21s -> 441.20s]  honest. And look at that. These archers. Oh they don't even stand a chance. So now
[441.20s -> 446.40s]  I'll put one more there and I'm gonna come over here and let's put a couple
[446.40s -> 454.10s]  this way because I'm gonna get smoked if I don't. Very cool. Let's do it. They got
[454.10s -> 456.42s]  it. They got that. They got it. I don't even have to go over there. They got that
[456.42s -> 461.98s]  covered. Wow this is awesome. So you're seeing I'm using the archers. I'm gonna
[461.98s -> 466.76s]  be using them a whole lot more. How's this side looking? Look that's alright. I
[466.76s -> 474.38s]  look good. Looking good. Freeze baby. And the more points you get after you kill a
[474.42s -> 477.46s]  group. Let's say see on the left there I just got a hundred points for stringing
[477.46s -> 481.34s]  together some kills. You spend those points you get skills and you can
[481.34s -> 486.38s]  upgrade your abilities which gives it like RPG feel to it. Oh it's just it's
[486.38s -> 491.49s]  fantastic guys. I gotta tell you it is fantastic. And here comes the final wave.
[491.49s -> 498.61s]  Let's go with a couple more archers over here just because I can. And let's do it.
[498.61s -> 504.87s]  I'm ready for you. They're coming on both sides. Little freak shows. Don't stand a
[504.87s -> 509.93s]  chance baby. They're good. Are they good over there? Let me shoot a long-range
[509.93s -> 518.06s]  stun. Oh boy. See some people just shoot violently like I like to be a little bit
[518.06s -> 521.42s]  more precise with it. Try and get some headshots. Get a few extra points. You
[521.42s -> 527.64s]  guys know the deal. Oh come on now. Oh what's that three in a row? Let me get a
[527.64s -> 533.34s]  three piece. Let me get a throw. Shoot. Oh this is looking kind of. No they're good.
[533.50s -> 540.23s]  They're good. We're good. It is game over. They got they got nothing. So I'll show
[540.23s -> 543.11s]  you the ending screen. He does a funny little dance. It's actually it's pretty
[543.11s -> 550.03s]  awesome. And here we go. Here's the dance. So yeah if you have not bought this game
[550.03s -> 554.63s]  already go buy it right now. It's on Steam. It is incredible. So I'll see you
[554.63s -> 558.33s]  guys all next time. Actually no let me let me show you this first. Got my point
[558.33s -> 564.81s]  see buy upgrades. See I have six skulls after doing a bunch of things. Oh this is
[564.81s -> 569.46s]  14 to upgrade and this makes it cheaper. It makes archers cheaper because they're
[569.46s -> 572.94s]  kind of expensive. But you get the deal and this eventually is gonna fill with
[572.94s -> 578.62s]  abilities and the replayability is just amazing. So yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
[578.62s -> 581.78s]  this and maybe I'll do more of this this series. Maybe I'll do more of this
[581.78s -> 585.18s]  because it's a very very interesting game. So I'll see you guys all next time
[585.18s -> 588.90s]  and take care everybody.
