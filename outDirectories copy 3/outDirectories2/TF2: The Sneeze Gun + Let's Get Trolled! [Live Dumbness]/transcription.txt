[2.17s -> 5.31s]  Is that uh, is that, is that electricity on your head?
[5.31s -> 7.87s]  That is, that is electricity on my face.
[7.87s -> 9.87s]  So, so that's a new unusual. Is that like one of the new ones?
[9.87s -> 12.24s]  That's, that's one of the new ones.
[12.24s -> 15.44s]  Cool. I'll give you a high five, bro.
[15.44s -> 17.44s]  Yay! Oh!
[17.44s -> 19.44s]  Electricity!
[19.44s -> 24.48s]  You okay, mate?
[24.48s -> 39.82s]  The Sneeze Gun.
[39.82s -> 46.82s]  If I had a name tag, I would just rename this to the Sneeze Gun right now.
[46.82s -> 48.82s]  I don't have any name tags, but I will.
[48.82s -> 50.82s]  Eventually this will be the Sneeze Gun and
[51.72s -> 53.72s]  you'll understand why very shortly.
[53.72s -> 57.80s]  Alright.
[57.80s -> 60.04s]  Who wants to get destroyed
[60.04s -> 62.92s]  by the Sneeze Gun?
[62.92s -> 64.92s]  This scout right here? Did you say you wanted to get
[64.92s -> 66.92s]  sneezed on?
[66.92s -> 68.92s]  Oh, okay. What about the spy?
[68.92s -> 71.86s]  Oh, he's already dead.
[71.86s -> 73.86s]  Oh, man.
[73.86s -> 76.17s]  I'm sorry, I can't control my cold!
[76.17s -> 78.17s]  Oh!
[78.17s -> 84.31s]  I'm gonna get headshot.
[84.31s -> 92.50s]  Man, I gotta call into work today.
[93.40s -> 96.16s]  God, I'm sorry, guys.
[96.16s -> 98.40s]  Oh.
[98.40s -> 100.96s]  I really gotta put on one of those masks.
[100.96s -> 103.32s]  So sorry about all that.
[111.92s -> 114.35s]  Now you just sound like Ace Ventura.
[114.35s -> 117.80s]  I forget which part,
[117.80s -> 119.80s]  but it's the part where he's like
[119.80s -> 121.80s]  When he's climbing out the
[121.80s -> 123.80s]  rhino's ass, there you go.
[123.80s -> 125.80s]  And he's just like
[125.80s -> 128.43s]  When he's climbing out the
[129.33s -> 131.33s]  rhino's ass.
[137.76s -> 140.06s]  It actually worked!
[174.42s -> 176.42s]  I wanna get up there.
[177.32s -> 182.56s]  BAM! Wow, that was pretty brutal.
[182.56s -> 184.56s]  I like took his head off.
[184.56s -> 186.87s]  I took his head clean off with that swing.
[186.87s -> 189.30s]  And that guy.
[189.30s -> 191.30s]  And this guy.
[191.30s -> 193.48s]  No, don't kill me.
[193.48s -> 196.04s]  I'm just a DMO man.
[196.04s -> 200.24s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[200.24s -> 204.21s]  Spy! Get out of here, spy!
[218.24s -> 220.24s]  Have you been sword fighting again, German?
[220.24s -> 222.24s]  No, dude! Dude, I'm still here!
[222.24s -> 224.24s]  Sword fighting!
[225.14s -> 227.14s]  I killed the answers!
[227.14s -> 230.78s]  Please let me live!
[230.78s -> 235.25s]  Let me live!
[243.34s -> 245.34s]  Is this guy seriously just gonna stand right here?
[245.34s -> 247.51s]  He's not gonna let me do this, is he?
[250.07s -> 254.10s]  Please don't put a sentry here, Engie.
[254.10s -> 256.10s]  Please don't do it.
[256.10s -> 258.10s]  He's trying.
[258.10s -> 260.73s]  Don't do it, dude.
[260.73s -> 263.03s]  Did he?
[263.03s -> 266.09s]  Hey, DMO, come over here, mate.
[266.09s -> 268.09s]  There's a prize.
[268.09s -> 270.26s]  Hold on a second.
[270.26s -> 272.26s]  I'll help you out, mate. I'll help you out.
[272.26s -> 275.51s]  Wow.
[275.51s -> 277.51s]  Well, if anybody
[277.51s -> 279.51s]  walks down there on the rail,
[279.51s -> 281.51s]  they're fucking dead.
[281.51s -> 284.78s]  Oh my god, dude. This is gonna
[284.78s -> 286.78s]  instantly kill anyone that comes
[286.78s -> 288.78s]  over here. Even if they take a peep through that window,
[288.78s -> 292.62s]  they are fucked.
[292.62s -> 294.62s]  I would move this, but I think we should just keep it here
[294.62s -> 296.62s]  for decorations. I think it looks
[296.62s -> 298.62s]  kind of pretty. We should all get Wranglers
[298.62s -> 300.62s]  and get just big bubbles.
[300.62s -> 302.62s]  Yeah, this is gonna be good.
[302.62s -> 304.62s]  Oh, look. This person on the cart.
[304.62s -> 306.62s]  Sentry's gone. Now's your chance.
[306.62s -> 308.62s]  Do it! Sentry!
[308.62s -> 310.62s]  They didn't do shit!
[310.62s -> 312.62s]  They didn't do anything.
[312.62s -> 314.62s]  It's cause I've bubbled mine. I wanna get
[314.62s -> 316.62s]  a good view.
[316.62s -> 318.62s]  Oh, look how good we are.
[318.62s -> 320.62s]  We build three sentries.
[320.62s -> 322.62s]  He's coming up the stairs.
[322.62s -> 324.62s]  Where is he? This asshole. This spy.
[324.62s -> 327.30s]  He's got my...
[327.30s -> 329.48s]  You'll recognize him. There he is. There's two of us.
[329.48s -> 331.78s]  What?
[331.78s -> 333.78s]  I don't know which one is you.
[333.78s -> 335.78s]  I'm chasing him right now.
[335.78s -> 337.78s]  Oh, so you're the one. Are you in front of him?
[337.78s -> 339.78s]  There we go. There's another one.
[339.78s -> 344.33s]  I seriously did not...
[344.33s -> 346.33s]  Oh, there he is. He's here again.
[346.33s -> 348.33s]  He's going up the evil stairs to stab me.
[348.33s -> 350.33s]  Get him! No! He face stabbed me!
[350.33s -> 353.40s]  Why is he doing this
[353.40s -> 355.40s]  to me all the time? He face stabbed me twice.
[355.40s -> 357.40s]  I hate spies.
[357.40s -> 359.40s]  Shit.
[359.40s -> 364.07s]  I'm gonna get some metal first.
[364.07s -> 366.82s]  Alright, let's go. We gotta hurry up.
[366.82s -> 370.47s]  We got like a train to catch.
[370.47s -> 373.10s]  Oh, the sentry train.
[373.10s -> 375.10s]  We gotta get on that payload train.
[375.10s -> 377.10s]  Three, two, one. Moving on.
[377.10s -> 381.19s]  Let's do it.
[381.19s -> 383.19s]  If I get backstabbed and this dies, I will be so upset.
[383.19s -> 385.19s]  On the railroad.
[385.19s -> 387.88s]  On a live long day.
[387.88s -> 389.88s]  Keep going. Keep going.
[389.88s -> 391.88s]  Oh, keep going? Cause I... No!
[391.88s -> 394.63s]  Keep going, he says.
[394.63s -> 396.63s]  Keep going.
[396.63s -> 398.63s]  We must push further up the hill.
[398.63s -> 404.12s]  We're doing the upward
[404.12s -> 406.12s]  parade of engineers. I protect you,
[406.12s -> 408.12s]  you protect me. I don't see a spy.
[408.12s -> 410.12s]  Pyro! Pyro! Pyro! Pyro! What?
[410.12s -> 412.12s]  And a scout! Put it down! Put it down!
[412.12s -> 414.12s]  Quick! Get him down!
[414.12s -> 416.12s]  I don't have any metal!
[416.12s -> 418.12s]  Yours is facing the wrong way!
[418.12s -> 420.12s]  There's a spy!
[420.12s -> 422.12s]  There's a spy! Oh, no!
[422.12s -> 424.12s]  No!
[424.12s -> 426.12s]  Yours is facing the wrong way!
[426.12s -> 428.12s]  He's trying to stair stab me.
[428.12s -> 430.30s]  He's gonna face stab me again, I know it.
[430.30s -> 432.30s]  He's dead. Alright, my sentry
[432.30s -> 434.30s]  died. He just poked it
[434.30s -> 436.30s]  once cause it got sapped to shit.
[436.30s -> 438.86s]  I ran out of metal.
[438.86s -> 441.35s]  This is shit.
[441.35s -> 443.53s]  I need more metal.
[443.53s -> 447.74s]  Put him down!
[447.74s -> 450.42s]  We're gonna win. Alright, quick, get him in.
[450.42s -> 453.24s]  Get him inside before we win.
[453.24s -> 455.24s]  Get him in front of the spawn door.
[455.24s -> 457.61s]  In front of the spawn door, right here!
[457.61s -> 460.62s]  Come on!
[460.62s -> 462.62s]  Build you piece of shit! Come on!
[462.62s -> 464.92s]  Quicker! Quicker!
[464.92s -> 466.92s]  We did nothing,
[466.92s -> 471.78s]  my goodness me.
[471.78s -> 473.78s]  That was so dumb.
[473.78s -> 475.78s]  We didn't even build a teleporter or a dispenser.
[475.78s -> 477.78s]  We didn't do
[477.78s -> 480.02s]  fucking anything.
[480.02s -> 482.02s]  We did nothing.
