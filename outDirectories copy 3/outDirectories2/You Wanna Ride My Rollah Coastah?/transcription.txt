[0.31s -> 20.60s]  So this is Coaster Crazy. This is a game that was made by Frontier. If you don't know who Frontier is, they're the guys that are responsible for the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise.
[20.60s -> 33.46s]  And this is their, like, new game. And I have to make this coaster sick. And I'm gonna try to do that as best as I possibly can.
[33.46s -> 40.61s]  I really, really hope nobody pukes. Let's do a different camera angle. How about this one?
[40.61s -> 47.11s]  Yay! Woohoo! This is so much fun!
[47.11s -> 51.66s]  Ooh, I love candy! Yay!
[51.66s -> 61.39s]  Oh my god! He just, like, threw up in his mouth! He's doing it again!
[61.39s -> 71.37s]  This coaster sucks! How's that? I kind of want to make something like this. There we go.
[71.37s -> 77.37s]  That's a little more ridiculous. I want my fear rating on this coaster to be through the roof, because you'll see that there's gonna be meters down here.
[77.37s -> 84.37s]  I'll show you in a second. So you see the E, F, and the N? You gotta keep those in the green, or else the coaster sucks, alright?
[84.37s -> 89.37s]  That's, like, the rule of thumb. If the coaster's not in the green, then it's a piece of crap. That's all I really know.
[89.37s -> 92.37s]  Oh my god!
[92.37s -> 93.37s]  Somebody-
[93.37s -> 100.55s]  No, are you okay? I'm sorry!
[100.55s -> 110.58s]  Here we go. We got some excitement here. We got some excitement here. Lost somebody.
[110.58s -> 116.20s]  What? We went through? Look at this guy!
[116.20s -> 121.08s]  What? What just happened?
[121.08s -> 133.66s]  Wait a second! Why is this intertwining like that? I didn't do that! I didn't want that to happen!
[133.66s -> 137.22s]  Oh, damn! I gotta move that!
[137.22s -> 139.22s]  How many people have to die?
[139.22s -> 142.93s]  Here we go!
[142.93s -> 148.86s]  I hope this is exciting!
[148.86s -> 153.29s]  His, like, girlfriend just got launched off, and he doesn't even care.
[153.29s -> 158.52s]  Alright, I have added so much dumb shit to this track.
[158.52s -> 163.95s]  Look at this. This is almost a 90 degree- I'm gonna kill someone. Someone's gonna die from this drop.
[163.95s -> 170.39s]  This is just- You don't wanna ride this ride.
[170.39s -> 176.21s]  If you're at Six Flags or whatever and you see this, you turn to your buddy and you go,
[176.21s -> 181.21s]  Look, we aren't fucking going on that thing. I don't care how much of a daredevil you wanna be.
[181.21s -> 185.33s]  It ain't happening.
[185.33s -> 190.94s]  I think, I'm pretty sure every single person throws up on this ride.
[190.94s -> 195.11s]  From what I've done, every single person is gonna throw up.
[195.11s -> 199.54s]  And that was the goal, I'm not gonna lie, that was the goal from the very beginning.
[199.54s -> 202.54s]  Was to make everybody throw up and, like, kill everybody.
[202.54s -> 204.54s]  So let's just see how many-
[217.97s -> 228.30s]  Who has that much stomach acid?
[228.30s -> 231.30s]  Did that guy just get back on the- Did you see that?
[231.30s -> 236.94s]  That guy flew off and went right back into the cab.
[236.94s -> 241.18s]  That guy- I'm so confused right now, I hope I got that.
[241.18s -> 247.37s]  Some guy flew out and got put back in the seat.
[247.37s -> 252.80s]  I wanna zoom in, I wanna close up on that and do a slo-mo. I really think that just happened.
[252.80s -> 258.18s]  That was unbelievable.
[258.18s -> 263.91s]  Just having this view and all the horrified reactions to things.
[263.91s -> 267.91s]  See, he landed again and he got puked on.
[267.91s -> 268.91s]  He landed again.
[268.91s -> 271.91s]  This king, this guy in the front is seriously a trooper.
[271.91s -> 277.26s]  He's the only one that ever succeeds to-
[277.26s -> 279.26s]  No, the king.
[279.26s -> 280.26s]  The king is dead.
[280.26s -> 284.85s]  I don't even know what's gonna happen. It's gonna be a horrible crash.
[284.85s -> 288.62s]  And you know what? It's okay.
[288.62s -> 291.62s]  Because this game- Look at that bump right there.
[291.62s -> 296.45s]  Alright, here we go. I have no idea what's about to happen.
[296.45s -> 299.45s]  All I know is that I wanna keep it at that.
[302.42s -> 305.17s]  Coaster Crazy, guys.
[305.17s -> 308.17s]  Coaster Crazy on the iOS app store.
[308.17s -> 309.54s]  Go get it.
[309.54s -> 312.54s]  If you like games like this, go get this goddamn game.
[312.54s -> 317.78s]  What you just saw is reason enough to fucking pick up this game. It really is.
[317.78s -> 319.78s]  Let's-
[319.78s -> 320.78s]  Instantly.
[320.78s -> 328.65s]  Hmm, something ain't right here.
[328.65s -> 331.65s]  Something isn't supposed to be there. I wonder what it is.
