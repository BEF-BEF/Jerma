[0.31s -> 14.57s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Grain Play Cromontary.
[14.57s -> 21.57s]  And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Devil Man with the Lock and Load, the Shield of Righteousness, and the Islander.
[21.57s -> 25.87s]  I don't know why the Islander's on. I mean, I think I killed maybe one person with it.
[25.87s -> 33.87s]  It doesn't go through my brain at the given time that maybe I should probably take this thing off and put on a sword that's not gonna gimp me for the rest of this game.
[33.87s -> 37.37s]  But I didn't. It stays on, whatever we're gonna move on.
[37.37s -> 41.37s]  And the first thing we're gonna talk about is my new computer. It's sitting up here on the shelf.
[41.37s -> 45.37s]  It looks beautiful. It looks pretty. I wanna kiss it right in the face.
[45.37s -> 49.37s]  Now, I'm gonna show you some pictures because I promised that I would show you what it looked like.
[49.37s -> 53.37s]  You know, people wondering what the case looked like, how does it look, what lights are inside of it.
[53.37s -> 59.37s]  There's one thing that I kinda don't like about it, and it's very, very minor. It's a very stupid thing to not like.
[59.37s -> 65.37s]  But the light on the graphics card, if you can see there, it says GeForce GTX in like a bright lime green.
[65.37s -> 70.37s]  That's cool. I think it's interesting, but sometimes it kinda catches my eye because I'm looking straight at it.
[70.37s -> 77.37s]  I'll show you a couple pictures here. You can see how it's just GeForce GTX like right in my face almost at all times.
[77.37s -> 81.37s]  And there's probably some way to turn that off in the bios. I just don't know how to do that.
[81.37s -> 87.80s]  But I love this thing. It's great. It's amazing. It allows me to do 1080p videos, 100% reliable now.
[87.80s -> 95.80s]  There will never be a 720 video on this channel. It's always gonna be 1080p from now until the hour of our death. Amen.
[95.80s -> 100.80s]  But yes, if it looks better, please let me know. If it looks worse, then that would be pretty odd,
[100.80s -> 105.80s]  considering that this is like one of the only times I've ever been able to reliably record 1080p.
[105.80s -> 113.80s]  And I don't know, you'd probably have to stuff a thermometer up my ass and I'd probably have a fever at that point because I'd be very steaming mad.
[113.80s -> 118.66s]  Anyways, why did I just say that? That was a very weird thing to say.
[118.66s -> 123.66s]  So what I want to talk about in this video is not so much the computer. We already kind of went over that.
[123.66s -> 130.21s]  But I want to talk about this gameplay and getting mad at video games, getting angry at games.
[130.21s -> 137.21s]  A lot of you guys know that I happen to do that from time to time. I swear. You know, don't say swears.
[137.21s -> 142.21s]  Look, I said it. There, I said it. I said it. I actually said it for the second time in my life.
[142.21s -> 145.38s]  And we're going to talk about swears. We're going to talk about swearing.
[145.38s -> 148.38s]  We're going to talk about energy coming out of your body when you're playing games.
[148.38s -> 152.38s]  And this gameplay right here is one of those times when I was a little upset.
[152.38s -> 156.38s]  I might have been a little angry. I might have been, you mad? Yeah, I was.
[156.38s -> 161.56s]  And here's why. What you haven't seen in this gameplay so far is us getting steamrolled.
[161.56s -> 165.56s]  We were getting destroyed for like 10 straight minutes.
[165.56s -> 171.56s]  Like there was two rounds before this or three rounds before this where we were losing substantially
[171.56s -> 176.56s]  and not even to the point where, oh, there's like two people on your team that are okay
[176.56s -> 180.56s]  and there's like three people on the other team that are doing great.
[180.56s -> 184.56s]  No, we were just getting crushed. Like, you know, you've had those games, we've all had them,
[184.56s -> 189.56s]  where the cart starts at the starting point and in like two blinks of an eye,
[189.56s -> 193.56s]  you look over and the cart has passed like the second goddamn point.
[193.56s -> 196.56s]  It was one of those games and it happened a couple of times in a row.
[196.56s -> 198.56s]  And it's very frustrating.
[198.56s -> 205.56s]  And I don't think getting mad at games is particularly a bad thing or getting frustrated at games.
[205.56s -> 210.80s]  But when you get mad at other people, that's when things start to get a little out of hand.
[210.80s -> 215.80s]  And let's say you're like, oh, this medic on my team sucks. Fucking kill him.
[215.80s -> 218.80s]  Like, no, that's not how I get really mad at games.
[218.80s -> 221.80s]  When I get mad at games, I get mad at like the stuff in the games
[221.80s -> 223.80s]  rather than the people playing them.
[223.80s -> 230.17s]  Except if your name is Star, then like fuck you because like you do it on purpose.
[230.17s -> 234.60s]  But what I'm getting at here, the real purpose of this video is when you get flustered
[234.60s -> 238.60s]  or when you get mad at a certain game, it doesn't have to just be Team Fortress 2.
[238.60s -> 242.60s]  It could be anything. It could be a MOBA. It could be an FPS. It could be an RTS.
[242.60s -> 245.60s]  It really doesn't matter what it is. You lose your edge.
[245.60s -> 249.60s]  I mean, there are probably some people that when they get mad, they play better,
[249.60s -> 251.60s]  but I'm not one of those people.
[251.60s -> 254.60s]  When I get pissed off at something, when I get really annoyed at something,
[254.60s -> 260.60s]  my skill level goes down like 60% because I'm just sitting there like fucking good.
[260.60s -> 263.60s]  Oh, you think your stupid game sucks?
[263.60s -> 266.60s]  And you can't even focus on what you're trying to do.
[266.60s -> 272.90s]  And if you just took a second, one second or two seconds to just sit back in your chair for a second,
[272.90s -> 279.08s]  let it run its course, and then go back into what you were doing, you'll be much better off.
[279.08s -> 283.08s]  This gameplay you're watching right now is that exact case.
[283.08s -> 285.08s]  I was playing like shit. We were getting destroyed.
[285.08s -> 289.08s]  I was playing like shit pretty much all day as well, trying to record some stuff,
[289.08s -> 294.08s]  trying to get some cool footage, and then this happened after I just calmed down.
[294.08s -> 296.64s]  So the moral of the story is this.
[296.64s -> 300.82s]  It's okay to get frustrated. It's okay to get mad at games.
[300.82s -> 303.82s]  Because the more you get frustrated, the more you will actually learn
[303.82s -> 306.82s]  because that means you didn't do something correctly
[306.82s -> 310.82s]  or you learn about a new game mechanic or a player was just better than you
[310.82s -> 312.82s]  and you can learn off of what they did.
[312.82s -> 317.99s]  So it's okay to get frustrated. Just try not to go totally overboard
[317.99s -> 322.99s]  because once you fall off the boat and there's like a storm like lightning striking and stuff
[322.99s -> 325.99s]  and it's like the boat is going up and down on the waves,
[325.99s -> 329.99s]  once you go overboard, that life vest ain't going to help you.
[329.99s -> 332.99s]  You think somebody's going to throw it to you and it's going to land in front of you.
[332.99s -> 335.99s]  You're going to be swimming to it like you're going to go under.
[335.99s -> 339.99s]  That's what's going to happen. So don't go overboard. Just stay on the goddamn boat.
[339.99s -> 344.17s]  Yell at the captain. If the captain's like going over these waves like shit,
[344.17s -> 347.17s]  he'd be like, hey, captain, fuck you. You suck at boating.
[347.17s -> 352.97s]  All right. Well, you don't have to. That would be kind of mean.
[352.97s -> 356.97s]  But just don't go overboard because once you're there, it's hard to come back.
[356.97s -> 359.46s]  And with that, I'm going to wrap up this video, guys.
[359.46s -> 362.46s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[362.46s -> 367.05s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course,
