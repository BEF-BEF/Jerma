[0.00s -> 13.40s]  I hear it's a good game. I hear it's an incredible franchise. I haven't played
[13.40s -> 17.66s]  Metal Gear Solid since I was probably 16. I played the first one and I played the
[17.66s -> 22.75s]  second one. I don't know the story and it's become so complicated and so
[22.75s -> 27.17s]  intertwined at this point. I seriously don't even know where I would even start.
[27.17s -> 31.93s]  Dozens of hours of cutscenes, tons of reading. I don't got time to read. You
[31.93s -> 36.89s]  always got time to read nowadays, you know? So what I did is I picked up this.
[37.93s -> 45.10s]  This is, got this online, a comprehensive Metal Gear NeuroStory
[45.10s -> 49.36s]  Electrodump. They have them for all kinds of things. This is for Metal Gear
[49.36s -> 53.98s]  because obviously the story is so complicated like we've talked about. So
[53.98s -> 59.18s]  that goes into the CD tray. I think it's just a standard disc at the sole. Now we put
[59.18s -> 68.71s]  on the electrodes. That goes there. Okay. Standard USB. It goes right in the back
[68.71s -> 86.22s]  of your computer. Just like that. That should be it. Ow, my teeth. Ow. Okay. Let's all
[86.22s -> 92.90s]  get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5. Get hype. Play button.
[92.90s -> 119.27s]  Big Boss was the boss. No, the boss was the boss and then Big Boss, Big Boss Man
[119.27s -> 123.07s]  took over because he had to kill her because the third game into the fifth
[123.07s -> 131.15s]  game, the fourth game in the worse than second. God damn it. I gotta watch it
[131.15s -> 137.06s]  again. I gotta start over. I gotta start over. I'll get it this time because I just,
[137.06s -> 142.41s]  it was getting confusing when they were all clones and shit. One more time. Get
[142.41s -> 147.39s]  hype. Get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5. Get hype.
[165.00s -> 199.20s]  What's happening? Where am I? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Metal Gear Solid story. I must
[199.20s -> 205.04s]  not have hit play. I must have fallen asleep. I got time. It's for the launch of
[205.04s -> 210.32s]  Metal Gear. Metal Gear Solid 5, the launch party.
