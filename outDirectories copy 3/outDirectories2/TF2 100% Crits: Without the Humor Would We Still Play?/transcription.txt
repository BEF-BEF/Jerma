[0.31s -> 13.82s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.82s -> 20.82s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as a bunch of different people. I think it's the Demoman, the Soldier, and the Scout.
[20.82s -> 24.82s]  I believe I could be wrong. I don't know how I edited this together.
[24.82s -> 28.82s]  But it's okay, because I'm not really gonna be talking about the gameplay all that much.
[28.82s -> 31.82s]  I'm gonna be talking about Team Fortress 2, and specifically...
[31.82s -> 38.82s]  Well, first of all, this is a 100% crit gameplay, not meant to be taken all that seriously.
[38.82s -> 43.82s]  And that's the point of this whole video. TF2 is not a very serious game.
[43.82s -> 46.82s]  I mean, there are, of course, the competitive aspects of this game.
[46.82s -> 51.82s]  There are the very hunker-down focus, get a bunch of kills as whatever your favorite class is.
[51.82s -> 59.82s]  But this game is meant, at least for me, primarily for the humor and the hilarity of every single moment.
[59.82s -> 63.82s]  There's at least one or two moments per round that I laugh at the screen for.
[63.82s -> 71.82s]  Like, heavy, like eating a sandwich and then getting backstabbed while the Spy then goes onto the point and gets hit in the face by a frying pan.
[71.82s -> 74.82s]  Like, these things happen all the time in this game.
[74.82s -> 78.82s]  And I really do truly think that this is sort of where I'm taking this video.
[78.82s -> 84.24s]  If Team Fortress 2 did not have the humor, where would it be?
[84.24s -> 89.24s]  Would it just fall into forgotten memories, or would we ever play this game that much anymore?
[89.24s -> 96.24s]  If the Spy didn't have revenge kill lines, if there were no fully voice acted characters, there were no meet the team videos,
[96.24s -> 105.24s]  if this was just a first person shooter and nothing else in a phong shaded world, would we still be playing right now at this point?
[105.24s -> 109.80s]  I don't think so. I don't think I would still be playing.
[109.80s -> 118.80s]  If Team Fortress went with the original design for Team Fortress 2, which was a more serious guys in camo outfits with rifles and stuff,
[118.80s -> 124.80s]  if that really was what it was and there was no character, there was no humor, there was no ridiculous moments,
[124.80s -> 130.10s]  I probably would have played it for a couple years maybe and then I would have probably moved on to something else.
[130.10s -> 136.34s]  Now I'm not sure if that's because I really love cartoons, I love animation, I love the voice acting behind different characters,
[136.34s -> 141.34s]  I love when people are brought to life and they don't really exist anywhere else and there's a whole lot of comedy,
[141.34s -> 146.34s]  I love Cartoon Network, all the adult swim shows, I love that stuff.
[146.34s -> 153.78s]  So not having it really just go, it's like meh, this game was fun for a while, but you know, whatever, I'm done with it.
[153.78s -> 156.78s]  What else is it? What time is it? Can I like do something else?
[156.78s -> 159.78s]  I would say the same thing about the Grand Theft Auto series.
[159.78s -> 169.78s]  There is a reason why the GTA series does so well and performs so well and gets such high ratings and has such a huge replayability factor.
[169.78s -> 174.78s]  It's because the game is bat shit crazy, like you can do the most ridiculous things in that game.
[174.78s -> 181.78s]  It's not meant to be taken that seriously unless you're playing obviously the campaign, but even the campaign does not take itself seriously.
[181.78s -> 187.78s]  People blow across the screen in cars and the cops like fly off buildings and stuff.
[187.78s -> 191.78s]  It's insanity and that's the reason why I keep going back and playing that game.
[191.78s -> 194.78s]  But I want to hear what you guys have to say about this.
[194.78s -> 200.78s]  What do you think is your favorite crazy moments in quotes game? Is it something like Team Fortress?
[200.78s -> 205.78s]  What's the craziest most hilarious thing you've ever seen in Team Fortress 2?
[205.78s -> 207.78s]  We'll start with that.
[207.78s -> 214.34s]  So I guess I'll go first because obviously there's nobody else in this room, so I guess I'll go first.
[214.34s -> 222.34s]  So anyways, my favorite most hilarious Team Fortress 2 moment is something that I recorded and it unfortunately got deleted.
[222.34s -> 229.34s]  I was going to show it because I wanted to talk about this and I was going to show it right freaking now, but it is no longer in existence.
[229.34s -> 233.34s]  What happened was I was playing as the spy and I was completely tryharding.
[233.34s -> 237.34s]  I was trying to get I was trying to get a gameplay backstabbing people, pull out the rubber, bang, bang, bang, getting a couple kills.
[237.34s -> 239.34s]  Go after this guy, get behind him.
[239.34s -> 242.34s]  I was trying to get a gameplay and I ended up turning a corner.
[242.34s -> 246.34s]  This was on viaduct right where one of the buildings are on the enemy team side.
[246.34s -> 249.34s]  I was in the building and I walked around the corner and there was a sniper there.
[249.34s -> 250.34s]  The sniper saw me.
[250.34s -> 253.34s]  He knew I was a spy and we started dancing.
[253.34s -> 254.34s]  He started to try quick scoping me.
[254.34s -> 258.34s]  He tried to then come in with the melee back up like I was trying to shoot him with the revolver.
[258.34s -> 265.88s]  And then we just stopped and then he crouched and I crouched and we walked into each other while we were still crouching.
[265.88s -> 267.88s]  I kept on calling him a spy.
[267.88s -> 269.88s]  He kept on saying yes over and over again.
[269.88s -> 275.88s]  And for about 45 seconds to two minutes, I don't know what the exact time was, we were just sitting there doing that.
[275.88s -> 277.88s]  And the whole time this is on viaduct.
[277.88s -> 279.88s]  There were just there was shit going on all around us.
[279.88s -> 285.88s]  A pyro, an enemy pyro actually came over and looked at us and then walked away.
[285.88s -> 289.88s]  He didn't want to interfere with our like weird tea party moment we were having.
[289.88s -> 295.88s]  I was cracking up so hard and I'm so mad that I didn't have it recorded because I was going to put it right here.
[295.88s -> 297.88s]  It was hysterical.
[297.88s -> 298.88s]  Why did that happen?
[298.88s -> 300.88s]  You can't do that in Call of Duty.
[300.88s -> 302.88s]  You can't do that in Battlefield.
[302.88s -> 307.88s]  You can't do that in any other game besides the hilarious Team Fortress 2.
[307.88s -> 311.50s]  And with that, that's going to wrap up the video guys.
[311.50s -> 319.50s]  So in the comment section again, please, if you can remember, leave me what you think your funniest Team Fortress 2 moment has been thus far.
[319.50s -> 320.50s]  And thank you so much for watching everybody.
[320.50s -> 321.50s]  You really do appreciate it.
[321.50s -> 323.50s]  And I'll talk to you all next time.
[323.50s -> 325.50s]  And of course, take care everybody.
