[6.01s -> 12.50s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight
[12.50s -> 17.70s]  I'm gonna be playing as the soldier with the black box, but who cares? Because there's something way
[17.70s -> 22.42s]  more important to discuss and talk about, and that's the fact that over the last couple of days we
[22.42s -> 29.27s]  have heard some news trickled down from the competitive community that TF2 eventually here
[29.27s -> 35.29s]  is going to be getting a matchmaking system put into the game. And my reaction to this is,
[35.29s -> 42.57s]  I'm sure a lot of your reactions to the same exact news, it's about damn time. It's taken Valve,
[42.57s -> 47.99s]  what, like eight years or something to figure out that there is a whole community around competitive
[47.99s -> 52.79s]  that want this, that have wanted this for a long time, and even the people like me that aren't
[52.79s -> 57.91s]  into competitive really at all are excited for this update as well because it allows everybody
[57.91s -> 63.16s]  to play the game that they want to play. Because as it stands right now, Team Fortress 2 has a lot
[63.16s -> 67.24s]  of servers, right? Some of them are geared towards more serious, some of them are Valve
[67.24s -> 71.96s]  servers. A lot of the Valve servers that people play on are just extremely reliable, and they're
[71.96s -> 77.08s]  always there, and it's just easy to fall into a Valve server. It just is. But whatever server
[77.08s -> 84.57s]  you happen to play on, 90% of your Team Fortress 2 in-game time will be on an open public game
[84.57s -> 91.50s]  server, and TF2 is an incredibly unique game where in any of these given places, in any of these given
[91.50s -> 97.42s]  servers, there's like four or five different types of people playing the game. Maybe you've got like
[97.42s -> 102.78s]  two pyros that just installed the game 10 minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're walking
[102.78s -> 106.86s]  around spraying shit, and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might
[106.86s -> 111.58s]  be going backwards to the other point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a
[111.58s -> 117.50s]  scout that has a hail zone scatter gun. He's on his 18th kill of a 17 kill streak. He just got 18.
[117.50s -> 123.18s]  He's going, oh, I just got 18. Sick. He runs up the stairs. He's trying his ass off. He's dodging
[123.18s -> 127.02s]  like, oh, the sentry almost got me. He looks to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge,
[127.02s -> 131.82s]  and there's two sandwich heavies having a fucking picnic. So he stops for a second. He goes,
[131.82s -> 137.50s]  two, and he walks forward and gets blown up out of the next door by a soldier's rocket, and he
[137.50s -> 142.47s]  rages in the chat, or he sits and sulks in his chair and goes, what the fuck is going on? The
[142.47s -> 146.71s]  two sandwich heavies then decide it's time to move their picnic. There's ants. There's ants here,
[146.71s -> 149.99s]  honey. I want to get out of here. So they get up. They pack up their sandwiches. They pack up
[149.99s -> 152.79s]  their lunches and their breakfast and whatever the fuck they're eating. They get up and they
[152.79s -> 156.71s]  walk out the door to go towards red because they think that's spot near like the A point for red.
[156.71s -> 161.75s]  It's pretty good. They walk out the door and they see four level three sentry guns pointing at them.
[161.75s -> 165.35s]  They get shot a million times and blow up. There's like nine engineers running around swinging their
[165.35s -> 169.19s]  wrenches in random directions, and then they get mad, and they just say, we're just trying to have
[169.19s -> 173.35s]  a fucking picnic here. What the hell's going on? The blue scout at this point respawns,
[173.35s -> 177.27s]  and he walks by the at least three or four statues because we all know there's at least
[177.27s -> 181.83s]  four people AFK in spawn when you play this game. You go by the museum of people standing still.
[181.83s -> 185.67s]  So he walks out the door and he readies his weapon. He's ready. I'm going to get another
[185.67s -> 190.31s]  20 kill streak. Just you watch, Gavin. I'm going to praise Gavin. And he goes forward, he runs,
[190.31s -> 194.95s]  and he starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a spy that's been sitting with a cloak and dagger
[194.95s -> 202.09s]  in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds. So there's like four separate video games being
[202.09s -> 209.08s]  played in the same server at the same time there. And I've been all those people. I have been every
[209.08s -> 213.42s]  single person I listed there and I talked about. I've been them. I've wanted to play and try really
[213.42s -> 218.62s]  hard and get a good score. I've been the dipshit throwing sandwiches around or like being a spy
[218.62s -> 222.22s]  and like cloak and daggering and just messing around. We've all done weird shit like that.
[222.22s -> 226.39s]  We all think this game is amazing. That's why there's so many ways to play it. And there's so
[226.39s -> 232.78s]  many different people that play that the variety there makes it so you could be in the same place
[232.78s -> 236.30s]  and be wanting to do completely different things than somebody else that's on the other team or
[236.30s -> 242.60s]  even on your own team. So having a matchmaking system will split up these entities. The new
[242.60s -> 247.64s]  players can play in a random server and not have to worry about some guy that has 10,000 hours in
[247.64s -> 251.64s]  the game killing him every two seconds. The people that want to throw sandwiches at each other can
[251.64s -> 256.04s]  throw sandwiches at each other. They won't queue up for the matchmaking to play sandwich heavy.
[256.04s -> 261.22s]  It's just going to be good for everybody, especially if the process to join a queue for
[261.22s -> 267.22s]  matchmaking is as painless as possible. It could be a button you press and it'll put you in a queue.
[267.22s -> 272.18s]  And if it doesn't take like more than five to ten minutes to get in a game, so many more people will
[272.18s -> 278.54s]  be inclined to use it. And competitive can grow. And wanting to be good at TF2 will grow a little
[278.54s -> 285.22s]  bit. It would be crazy to see that because it's been like almost 10 years for a community like
[285.22s -> 290.42s]  this. It blows my mind every day guys. It seriously does. That TF2 is like people are still this
[290.42s -> 297.64s]  dedicated and they still... This would be a fucking one for the history books. If 10 years later TF2
[297.64s -> 303.82s]  will have a resurgence in competitive, like 10 fucking years later, it would just be cool to see
[303.82s -> 309.59s]  it happen. As long as the system in place was any good. Which is the last thing we're going to talk
[309.59s -> 316.02s]  about here in this video. Will it be good? Not necessarily will it be good. I hope it's good.
[316.02s -> 321.38s]  Because there is a huge potential here for this to go in one of two different ways.
[321.38s -> 330.04s]  And the first way is Man vs Machine 2.0. You just get into gigantic dump queue and maybe you're
[330.04s -> 334.74s]  gonna get into a Man vs Machine game with a bunch of random people. I don't want that. I really don't
[334.74s -> 339.30s]  want that. If that's what it is, at least it's a step in the right direction. But I really hope
[339.30s -> 346.18s]  it's a realized thing. With a ranking system, actual stats you can see, potentially leaderboards,
[346.18s -> 354.50s]  top players, separate queues for Highlander, 6v6, 1v1, ulti duo. Imagine the possibilities.
[354.50s -> 360.26s]  And imagine the shot in the arm this could give this game if it's done right. And if it isn't
[360.26s -> 366.92s]  done right, if it is done in this sort of gigantic Man vs Machine dump queue, then I'm just not so
[366.92s -> 370.92s]  sure I'm gonna care that much about it. But we're gonna have to see. We're gonna have to wait and
[370.92s -> 375.40s]  see. I know as much as you guys do at this point. And over the next couple of days, over the next
[375.40s -> 380.68s]  couple of weeks, I'm sure we'll hear a lot more about it. And I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm a
[380.68s -> 387.58s]  pessimistic excited. Because I don't want to get my hopes up for this. But anyways, that's gonna
[387.58s -> 391.19s]  wrap it up, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. We'll see
[391.19s -> 394.31s]  what happens. Take care, everybody. And goodbye.
