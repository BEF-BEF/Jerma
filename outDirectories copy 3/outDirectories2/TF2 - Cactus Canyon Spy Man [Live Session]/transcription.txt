[4.34s -> 11.45s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here. Welcome to Cactus Canyon. This is the second of the two
[11.45s -> 16.41s]  new maps. I just made myself very well known to the snipers over here, so I might as well try to
[16.41s -> 22.46s]  just debate out a headshot. And he's using the Sydney Sleeper. I could have seen that by looking
[22.46s -> 26.78s]  down at the left of my screen, but you know, sometimes you just don't pay attention, and that's
[26.78s -> 32.06s]  exactly what happened. But anyways, I'll give you my thoughts on the map. I like this map a lot,
[32.14s -> 37.00s]  because it reminds me of Frontier, and I don't know why, but I like Frontier a lot. I like, like,
[37.00s -> 44.38s]  the inclines and the declines. It adds for some cool dynamics, but hopefully I don't get killed
[44.38s -> 49.30s]  again here. Let's get behind this medic, and then this guy too. He doesn't know. He doesn't know. He
[49.30s -> 53.32s]  doesn't know. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy. Don't throw those
[53.32s -> 59.05s]  in here. There's somebody in here. I'm trying to use the bathroom. What is going on with that door?
[60.58s -> 65.10s]  That door is going, like, insane right now. I'm also using this thing.
[65.98s -> 76.02s]  Pyro. Pyro. What do I go for here first? This guy, and then this guy, and then this guy too.
[76.02s -> 86.73s]  No. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Absolutely no. Make my way back around. Let's disguise as a spy.
[86.73s -> 91.35s]  Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. See if we can get that sentry
[91.35s -> 98.92s]  before he gets it built to level three, and I will be able to. It's okay. It's okay. One hit.
[99.86s -> 110.07s]  Nice shot. Excellent job. Excellent job, team. You deserve every reward. Hmm. They're really far. I
[110.07s -> 119.00s]  don't know. How are we at their spawn right now? This doesn't make any sense. Come here. The card
[119.00s -> 127.42s]  is all the way up here, and somehow we're at their spawn. That's odd. Um, okay. Well, just get. Watch
[127.42s -> 135.48s]  out. Watch out for the Pyro. Uh, this is not good. I'm gonna go. I'm going on blue. We're gonna do the
[135.48s -> 140.30s]  switch right now. I can't. I can't make the switch. I'm dead here for sure.
[145.78s -> 156.62s]  Hello, everyone. It's me, the Spy. Today I'm going to be using the Kunai, the Le ChargÃ©,
[156.62s -> 164.44s]  and of course my Sapper that I undoubtedly love to use. As you see here, I get covered in Gerate.
[164.44s -> 170.52s]  It's too bad because the Sniper is an asshole. He won't kill me, though. I will bait him into
[170.52s -> 176.28s]  this room where I will keep baiting him around the corner. He will fall down, and I will shoot
[176.28s -> 189.06s]  him. Just watch. Keep your eyes peeled. Keep your eyes peeled. Hold on. Oh, there he is. I found him.
[189.06s -> 192.66s]  I told you he would come down eventually, and I would kill him, but I didn't. That was part of
[192.66s -> 198.63s]  the plan, too. This next part of the plan is to follow the Sniper up the stairs and step him in
[198.63s -> 214.66s]  his bed. See? Watch this. Shit. Whoa. Too much going on there. Too much going on there. I wonder
[214.66s -> 221.78s]  if I'm being healed by this guy. How obvious of a spy am I? Hi, I'm just being healed by my medic.
[221.78s -> 230.70s]  Hope nobody heard that. Hope nobody heard that. Hope nobody heard that. Whoa.
[237.48s -> 242.92s]  Thanks, man. Really just saved my ass right there, Pyro. Whoever knocked me in the air.
[242.92s -> 255.29s]  I thought I was dead, but I just wasn't. Hey, Scout. Oh, just out of reach. Still might be able
[255.29s -> 263.70s]  to get him. Come on. I gotta land that. I gotta start landing those with the medic. What am I
[263.70s -> 272.38s]  doing? What's happening? What happened? I got him. Okay. A very weird chain of events is happening
[272.38s -> 283.50s]  right now and allowing me to be a moron and play spy correctly somehow, some way. Come here. I knew
[283.50s -> 296.28s]  you were gonna do that. I knew you were gonna do that. And the series of unfortunate things
[296.92s -> 301.66s]  ends up getting me knocked into the... If that's not like a... That was like scripted,
[301.66s -> 310.62s]  what just happened right there. You are... Oh, no. Look out. Look out. Look out.
[311.98s -> 318.14s]  Look at me. I'm standing on your stickies. I'm a spy. You might as well blow it up,
[318.14s -> 327.11s]  but blow up the stickies. Hey, look. Hey, I'm... There you go. This fall is gonna kill me.
[328.63s -> 336.78s]  In this next clip, I'm going to show you how to properly take out a sentry. A lot of spies
[336.78s -> 343.13s]  don't know exactly how to do it, and it gets them in a lot of trouble. As you see, I used my dead
[343.13s -> 349.50s]  ringer to make that soldier think I was dead. But in actuality, I'm actually still alive.
[349.50s -> 353.98s]  Come up around these stairs. There should be a health pack up here in this room. If you see
[353.98s -> 361.34s]  another spy, give him a nod and go on your way. So taking out your sapper, move to the sentry in
[361.34s -> 372.82s]  question and stab it. No, wait, that's not right. This choke right here seriously rivals some of
[372.82s -> 377.86s]  the craziest chokes in the game. There's only one spot that people can come through, and it's right
[377.86s -> 386.95s]  here. I just bumped into a spy, I think, somewhere. But man, this choke is insane. They have to come
[386.95s -> 395.72s]  through this door. How do we do that? I'm gonna have to just barrel my way through everybody.
[396.28s -> 402.90s]  I can't even do that. I seriously can't do that. I need to wait till they push out a little more
[402.90s -> 409.93s]  and just use the revolver. I wonder if I can, like... See, this is a good time to put on the...
[411.77s -> 417.75s]  This guy just, like, dancing over in the corner by himself. Well, we're gonna go for it. Hopefully
[417.75s -> 430.71s]  this pyro doesn't light me. And I'm coming in P. Nope, that ain't happening. Make our way back again.
[430.71s -> 441.13s]  And... Rinse, repeat. Can we do it? And here we go. Nobody pay attention to me. Oh, I'm doing...
[441.13s -> 449.00s]  Okay, there's a lot going on here. This is gonna be tough. Oh, you bumped him right into me. Oh,
[449.00s -> 467.21s]  come on. Oh god, no! He got in the way! Get him out of here. You give me that uber? You give me
[467.21s -> 485.61s]  that uber and things are gonna change. Oh, jeez! Oh, random crits. Oh, boy. Oh, dear. Oh, that was
[485.61s -> 491.67s]  a... That was a lot of other teammates, team members, or whatever that didn't make it out.
[491.67s -> 504.36s]  There's a... Where's this... Oh, it's all over here. That guy got telepracked. Oh, dear.
[505.16s -> 514.36s]  Let's get the little trap. That's not a very good trap. That was a great trap, Jerma. Very good.
[514.36s -> 519.10s]  That was a good trap. Did I do good? Mommy, look at my, like, finger painting I just made.
[521.43s -> 530.33s]  Oh, I'm so bad at putting traps down in the same spot. 30 seconds. 30 seconds. We can do this.
[532.12s -> 543.70s]  Dear, that's a lot of people. This map. This map. Oh, I need heals. Oh, dear.
[546.90s -> 555.54s]  All right, where's my weapon? Five seconds. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not much longer. Not
[555.54s -> 563.56s]  much longer. We did it. No, it's over time. We didn't do it yet. Now we did it, right? Yeah,
[563.56s -> 573.61s]  we did. You can't escape me, Scout. You can't escape me. Well, that might wrap it up, but I do
[573.61s -> 578.68s]  want to say, if you do want to see more just general kind of live comms, like lightly edited
[578.68s -> 584.10s]  live comms, I have five dominations, right? That's impossible. That is literally it. Look at all our
[584.10s -> 585.62s]  dominations. My God.
