[1.40s -> 5.48s]  Oh jeez, I've got so much work to do. Oh, goodness gracious.
[8.17s -> 20.74s]  I don't want to talk to him right now. Hello? Yes, I'm aware that I owe the reports next Tuesday.
[20.74s -> 25.94s]  Yes, I don't care. I don't want to talk to you anymore. I'm a professional fucking businessman
[25.94s -> 31.29s]  and I don't care. Good day. There's my files.
[41.03s -> 47.19s]  Okay, it's time to be a total dickwad. If you don't know how to be a total dickwad on TwoFort,
[47.19s -> 51.35s]  I'll show you. So what you want to do is you want to disguise as a friendly sniper.
[51.91s -> 56.66s]  Go out here, make sure you have whatever sniper rifle they have out. Pull out the dead ringer
[56.66s -> 61.08s]  and just pretend like you've never played this fucking game ever before in your life.
[61.08s -> 66.49s]  I don't, hey, where, where do we start? Where's the spawn? I don't, I, uh.
[67.59s -> 73.21s]  And then you come back here, go on in your uh, into your resupply and do it again.
[74.79s -> 88.26s]  Hey, I don't know what time is it? I've never played. Mom? Mom, how did I, how do you play
[88.26s -> 98.46s]  Team Fortress 2? Oh shit, the gig is up. The jig is up. No, it's not. And there's a dispenser here.
[98.46s -> 108.52s]  I can make this even worse for this guy. You thought you killed me.
[115.10s -> 126.68s]  What even just happened? Did I get backstabbed and then headshot immediately?
[127.69s -> 132.57s]  Or did I get double like headshot by like two or three different snipers? I have no idea what
[132.57s -> 142.65s]  just happened. You know, you got to mourn for these two gentlemen, two fort snipers. You got
[142.65s -> 150.44s]  to mourn for them. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the, wait, no, that's wedding.
[150.44s -> 153.80s]  That's a wedding ceremony. I'm supposed to be doing like a funeral. Well, that, I fucked up
[153.80s -> 161.27s]  that joke. Let's keep going. They have a century in our intel. Are you serious right now? Hold on,
[161.27s -> 170.22s]  I got to check this out. How did they get this down here? What, who let this happen?
[171.26s -> 179.85s]  There's a century in our intel. How the, how did this happen? Is it, there's an engineer,
[179.85s -> 186.87s]  there's a teleporter down here too? You got to be shitting me. All right. See, that's going down.
[186.87s -> 193.66s]  I ain't letting this guy get away with that. Sniper's a good job, mate. Sniper's a good job,
[193.66s -> 200.68s]  mate. Sniper's a good job, mate. Get those direct shots. What's up? I'll take the intel, baby.
[203.05s -> 211.29s]  Oh, uh, right. Uh, I'm on the blue team. The blue team doesn't pick up the blue intelligence.
[213.11s -> 220.73s]  Sometimes I wonder. It's going on. We're, we're just going to go harass the hell
[221.29s -> 230.18s]  out of these snipers over here. We're going to get a bunch of Zatoichi kills.
[230.18s -> 237.56s]  Good evening. My name is Jerma. I suck so bad. It's okay. I, what is there a cent, why is there
[237.56s -> 256.14s]  a century there? Here we go. See you. That can be only one. How did I get covered in Jirardi?
[256.14s -> 263.06s]  That's what I want to know. No, I forgot. I already forgot that that century gun was there.
[265.05s -> 280.82s]  God damn. Eight, six, seven, eight. I look at where I am.
[284.04s -> 287.16s]  I made it on top of this thing. Look at how cool it is.
[287.16s -> 295.86s]  If that guy headshot me, right? If I fucking forget about this century one more time,
[295.86s -> 303.10s]  I swear to God, I'm going to flip out. There's nothing here. There's a century right there.
[303.10s -> 308.20s]  You don't have to protect this. I didn't, how did I not, did I hit the damn century?
[309.00s -> 318.06s]  That was stupid. That was so stupid. I think it just gave me diarrhea and that wasn't a headshot
[318.06s -> 331.37s]  either. I will get this guy. Can't see. I can't see. Don't you guys know how two foot works?
[332.33s -> 338.78s]  You can't just like walk in a straight line on the balcony. Dude, that's not how it works.
[338.78s -> 345.00s]  Look at, what if these people are getting destroyed? I'm going to prove to you guys
[345.00s -> 349.24s]  why that's a bad idea. You ready? Like watch. See? Do people not understand? Just watch.
[349.80s -> 364.18s]  Oh, hi. I'm going to walk this way on the two foot map. Ah, what do these do? All right,
[364.18s -> 371.05s]  before I go, I'm ending the video. Teleporter exit. Okay, cool. That makes sense.
[371.85s -> 379.26s]  Teleporter exit. Where are these entrances? Are they down here? Why? You're going to have to walk
[379.90s -> 386.14s]  anyways. If you go through that teleporter, you're going to have to walk at least some of them.
[386.14s -> 391.85s]  I don't understand. Somebody explain it to me. They don't even go down here.
[392.41s -> 403.30s]  Where do those teleporters go? What? All right, so let's go ahead and go over my loadout before
[403.30s -> 408.90s]  the video starts. We got the grenade launcher, the sticky bomb launcher, the half set Aichi,
[408.90s -> 412.58s]  the unusual, that's my patch, and the moomer smites.
