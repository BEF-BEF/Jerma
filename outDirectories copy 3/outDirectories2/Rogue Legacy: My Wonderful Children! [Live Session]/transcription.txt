[0.31s -> 13.57s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Rogue Legacy.
[13.57s -> 19.57s]  You can go get it on the Steam store for $15, $14.99 USD, and it's a fantastic game.
[19.57s -> 23.57s]  I know a lot of you guys probably have already heard of this game, but if you have not,
[23.57s -> 29.74s]  this is kind of in the same ballpark as Binding of Isaac, where you get one life.
[29.74s -> 32.74s]  If you die in that life, you start over from the very beginning.
[32.74s -> 36.74s]  Now the difference with this game is that it's called Rogue Legacy for a reason.
[36.74s -> 45.74s]  You pass down all the gold and all the upgrades that your last character made to a child that you have.
[45.74s -> 52.74s]  And it gets pretty ridiculous, the things that your children have, the different ailments and the different traits that they have.
[52.74s -> 55.74s]  But this is a live commentary. I'm going to let it speak for itself. I'm going to let it get right into it here.
[55.74s -> 58.74s]  Just want to briefly introduce this so you know what this kind of is.
[58.74s -> 67.92s]  And also to say, if you want to see a Rogue Legacy series where I play through and kill the bosses or do some live comms,
[67.92s -> 72.92s]  if you want to see this as a series, please let me know, because I'm trying to gauge if you guys want to see this more or not.
[72.92s -> 78.92s]  So with a comment or a like or anything like that to let me know that you want to see more of this game, then please do it.
[78.92s -> 82.10s]  But that is going to wrap up this little intro here, guys.
[82.10s -> 85.10s]  Enjoy the live commentary, and I'll see you all next time.
[85.10s -> 87.10s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[95.78s -> 99.10s]  Ow. Ow. Ow.
[99.10s -> 101.36s]  Oh, lightning!
[101.36s -> 103.73s]  Alright, so let's go.
[103.73s -> 108.73s]  I should probably show you guys my castle first, because I guess I've been playing for at least a few hours.
[108.73s -> 116.15s]  As you can see, I'm working on spellcasting, having my mages do more damage.
[116.15s -> 121.15s]  I'm not too good with the spell sword people, but I hear they're really good.
[121.15s -> 127.33s]  I love using the miner. Miners are amazing. If you don't know what miners do, is miners can pick up more money.
[127.33s -> 133.57s]  So when a coin drops on the ground and you run over it, you get a higher percentage than anybody else in the game.
[133.57s -> 138.57s]  I love using miners. They don't do very much damage, and they're kind of weak as all hell, but I love using them.
[138.57s -> 144.57s]  And plus, you can see through walls and see where all the chests are and everything, so let's see if we can grab a miner after this.
[144.57s -> 149.45s]  Well, who the hell am I using right now? I think this is a knight. Yeah, this is a knight.
[149.45s -> 152.94s]  Alright, don't need any new equipment, don't need any new runes.
[152.94s -> 156.44s]  I would love to really expl- actually, wait a second.
[156.44s -> 166.13s]  I would love to really explain everything about this game, but there's just so much going on, like the rune system and the item system.
[166.13s -> 171.67s]  It would be a pain in the ass for me to explain, but you know what? Can I even unlock any of these? I'm about to lose all this money.
[171.67s -> 179.55s]  Maybe not. Yeah, I am. Whatever, let's just go. I can't do any upgrades.
[179.55s -> 185.55s]  So anytime you start a new castle, well not a new castle, anytime you randomly generate a new castle, you have to give away all your money.
[185.55s -> 192.73s]  And the only reason why I didn't just give away 100% of it right there was because I bought an upgrade to make it so he doesn't take as much, so death doesn't take as much.
[192.73s -> 196.73s]  But see, look at this coin. Yes. See, I got 12 gold.
[196.73s -> 201.53s]  And essentially, what you want to do in this game is you want to break friggin' everything.
[201.53s -> 206.53s]  Like, you want to smash every single thing there is, because there's always a chance something can drop money.
[206.53s -> 212.09s]  And it's got this cool little, like, super Metroid feature where you can see the rooms you're going to and where you are and stuff.
[212.09s -> 218.90s]  It's pretty awesome. Let's just go. Get out of here, you spooky bastards.
[218.90s -> 223.03s]  Remember, Jerma's Tip. Smash everything.
[223.03s -> 233.38s]  And the goal hill, the ultimate goal, I mean, of course the ultimate goal of any of these, like, weird action, role-playing, rogue-like...
[233.38s -> 238.87s]  Why are you shooting through walls? Is you want to get as much money as you possibly can before you die.
[238.87s -> 246.74s]  Because in the intro, which I'm assuming I did do an intro to this game, you have to, you have heirs, right?
[246.74s -> 250.74s]  So every time I die, this is not the character I'm going to be playing with.
[250.74s -> 260.28s]  It's some child of this, or of the guy previously that had kids, that had, like, a wife.
[260.28s -> 262.52s]  When did I get to see the wife, though? Don't ask me why.
[262.52s -> 266.02s]  Wait a minute. I just had, like, a really weird revelation.
[266.02s -> 270.58s]  Are they, like, all inbreeding? Is that why there's no, like, father and mother?
[270.58s -> 278.63s]  I know there's, like, a journal you can read, but I'm more about the action, more about the gameplay than I am about the storyline in these type of games.
[278.63s -> 279.63s]  So let's just go!
[279.63s -> 285.94s]  This is a random teleporter. It will take me randomly somewhere. I don't want to take it right now.
[285.94s -> 289.98s]  But I'm just smashing through enemies, and you just want to collect money.
[289.98s -> 293.34s]  Collect money to upgrade. Collect money to upgrade.
[293.34s -> 298.34s]  Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. Last as long as you can inside of the castle.
[298.34s -> 301.54s]  Money! Woo, yummy!
[301.54s -> 305.87s]  Probably should show you this, too. Each person has, like, a special ability.
[305.87s -> 309.87s]  This, the knight can block attacks, as you see there, by holding down.
[309.87s -> 312.87s]  I'm using a controller, so it's Y on my Xbox controller.
[312.87s -> 315.39s]  Open.
[315.39s -> 320.78s]  I have beat the first boss already. I've played for about five and a half hours or so.
[320.78s -> 331.10s]  And I really just want to get familiar with this game, because like I said in the beginning, it is pretty, it's pretty confusing and hard to grasp right when you start playing.
[331.10s -> 336.91s]  So I wanted to make sure that I put a few hours into it first before I really want to start talking about it.
[336.91s -> 343.98s]  So right now, if you notice, we went from the blue area over to the green area, and the blue area is the low level area.
[343.98s -> 347.98s]  It's like 1 to 20 or 1 to 15 or 1 to 30 or something.
[347.98s -> 352.86s]  Over here, if you'll notice when I smack an enemy, they...ow.
[352.86s -> 362.02s]  See how this guy at the top, level 19? This forest area is the second area you should be going to once you beat the first boss.
[362.02s -> 365.19s]  And I already did beat the first boss, as previously stated.
[365.19s -> 370.03s]  I'm actually not doing too bad. I'm not getting a whole lot of money, though.
[370.03s -> 374.03s]  I gotta spend more time focusing on where the chests are.
[375.03s -> 379.03s]  Not so much progressing in the areas. I want to just upgrade the hell out of this whole entire game.
[379.03s -> 383.21s]  You guys know me, man. I'm a psycho when it comes to upgrades.
[383.21s -> 388.28s]  If a game has an upgrade system, and I really don't know why this is.
[388.28s -> 390.28s]  I think it's maybe something in my childhood.
[390.28s -> 395.28s]  Maybe like I dropped like my Spider-Man on the ground and I couldn't like fix it.
[395.28s -> 399.28s]  So I'm always like for the rest of my life wanting to fix things and upgrade things.
[399.28s -> 403.90s]  I don't know why, but I have this insatiable need for upgrades.
[404.90s -> 407.98s]  What am I doing? I'm just like standing in this room.
[407.98s -> 409.98s]  Any game with an upgrade system drives me insane.
[409.98s -> 415.29s]  It's like a sick thing I love.
[415.29s -> 422.13s]  Okay, hold on a second. Try hard mode. It's gonna be tough.
[422.13s -> 427.03s]  It's also good that I have a lot of life leech on, equipped.
[427.03s -> 430.27s]  I'll go over that in a minute. Let me go over this first, though.
[430.27s -> 433.90s]  So what this is, okay.
[433.90s -> 437.90s]  So this, this is a fairy chest and they have very weird objectives.
[437.90s -> 443.20s]  So let's say I have to like defeat all the enemies and see that in the top right, that little objective thing.
[443.20s -> 445.20s]  I just did it so I get to open this chest.
[445.20s -> 448.38s]  Some of these are almost impossible.
[448.38s -> 452.38s]  Like some of them are like don't take any damage from spikes around the entire room.
[452.38s -> 455.38s]  But once you complete it, you get to open it and look what's in here.
[455.38s -> 459.38s]  There's a rune that you can socket into your various gear.
[459.38s -> 463.38s]  And this is a bounty rune, so I'm assuming it's gonna be more money drops.
[463.38s -> 464.68s]  But we'll just keep going.
[464.68s -> 469.16s]  Break your vase.
[469.16s -> 475.55s]  Okay, so I made it back to the blue area, which is the lower level area.
[475.55s -> 479.05s]  I'm actually gonna stay back here. Watch out for the spikes.
[479.05s -> 481.05s]  I'm gonna stay back here for a little bit.
[481.05s -> 483.05s]  Because damn it.
[483.05s -> 485.54s]  Because I could use the money.
[485.54s -> 491.38s]  One cool thing about this game, something I really like, is the developers.
[491.38s -> 496.56s]  They snuck in a bunch of hidden rooms because everything is randomly generated.
[496.56s -> 498.56s]  All this stuff is randomly generated.
[498.56s -> 502.56s]  They snuck in a bunch of rooms that have their like development history.
[502.56s -> 505.56s]  Like oh, this was our first game. This was our second game.
[505.56s -> 507.56s]  And it's pretty cool how they do that.
[507.56s -> 510.06s]  This room is a pain in the ass.
[510.06s -> 512.06s]  Get linked. Get Zelda linked, bro.
[512.06s -> 516.78s]  I'm gonna drop down.
[516.78s -> 520.78s]  I'm not too happy about the amount of HP I've lost in this run so far.
[520.78s -> 523.27s]  But there's a chest up here.
[523.27s -> 525.58s]  See the top right? See how that is a blinking chest?
[525.58s -> 529.58s]  If you play as a miner and you unlock the spelunking,
[529.58s -> 533.58s]  you can see every chest all over the map, like everywhere in the game.
[533.58s -> 535.88s]  So it's pretty awesome to go as a miner.
[535.88s -> 538.38s]  That's a fake painting, but let's open it up.
[538.38s -> 542.34s]  It's all about that money.
[542.34s -> 545.34s]  And at this point right now, I need a lot of money to be able to really do anything.
[545.34s -> 547.84s]  I need at least like this...
[547.84s -> 551.84s]  If I don't get at least a thousand gold in a run before I die,
[551.84s -> 553.84s]  then it was pretty much a wasted run.
[553.84s -> 556.08s]  Because I...
[556.08s -> 559.08s]  A lot of my stuff at this point is pretty difficult to upgrade.
[559.08s -> 564.61s]  But if you're a big fan of stuff like Binding of Isaac, this is...
[564.61s -> 566.61s]  Ooh, okay. Okay.
[566.61s -> 569.17s]  This room is interesting.
[569.17s -> 571.66s]  So what I have to do with this guy is...
[571.66s -> 574.97s]  This guy takes 25% of my money I have right now,
[574.97s -> 576.97s]  and he gives me a chance to open one of these chests.
[576.97s -> 579.72s]  If...
[579.72s -> 582.72s]  In one of these chests is triple the amount of money that I just gave him.
[582.72s -> 585.72s]  And the other two chests is nothing. I'm gonna go for it.
[585.72s -> 588.79s]  All right. Left, middle, or right?
[588.79s -> 592.55s]  I want to go mid.
[592.55s -> 594.11s]  No!
[594.11s -> 595.11s]  Ugh!
[595.11s -> 597.11s]  You know, this has happened a couple times.
[597.11s -> 599.11s]  I want to be able to kill this guy.
[599.11s -> 601.11s]  So developers, if you're watching right now,
[601.11s -> 604.11s]  let me bury the back of my sword in the back of this guy's head.
[604.11s -> 607.11s]  Like, let me just bury it in his head if I lose,
[607.11s -> 609.11s]  because that guy's a shithead.
[609.11s -> 612.86s]  Hey, thanks for the 325 gold, haha!
[612.86s -> 615.68s]  How do I get up? Oh, it's over here.
[615.68s -> 618.43s]  And like, you can always see where you haven't gone yet,
[618.43s -> 619.43s]  seeing the top there.
[619.43s -> 621.43s]  That little blip, that little blue blip.
[621.43s -> 623.93s]  That means I have not been up there yet.
[623.93s -> 626.17s]  Defeat all the enemies, okay!
[626.17s -> 629.50s]  This is gonna be tough. I might die here.
[629.50s -> 631.50s]  That life leech is so important.
[631.50s -> 634.31s]  That life leech.
[634.31s -> 638.60s]  6 HP every time I kill somebody.
[638.60s -> 639.60s]  What's in the box?
[639.60s -> 642.67s]  Spirit rune for a helm.
[642.67s -> 645.30s]  And I'll make sure before this video is over,
[645.30s -> 647.47s]  I will make sure to show you that,
[647.47s -> 648.47s]  like, what that is.
[648.47s -> 650.47s]  Because it can be kind of confusing.
[650.47s -> 656.47s]  How much money do I have?
[656.47s -> 658.47s]  If that asshole didn't take the 25%,
[658.47s -> 660.47s]  I'd be fine right now.
[660.47s -> 666.15s]  Hey, buddy!
[666.15s -> 669.61s]  Woohoo! Where am I going?
[669.61s -> 671.61s]  Ooh, another journal entry. Journal entry number 17.
[671.61s -> 673.61s]  I must be going insane.
[673.61s -> 675.61s]  I stumbled across a carnival inside this castle,
[675.61s -> 677.61s]  complete with a sad clown and everything.
[677.61s -> 679.61s]  He's sort of an ass, but I guess you can't be too picky
[679.61s -> 681.61s]  with your friends in a place like this.
[681.61s -> 683.61s]  Getting hungry again?
[683.61s -> 685.61s]  Good thing I topped on the chicken legs
[685.61s -> 687.61s]  and I found these in a chandelier.
[687.61s -> 689.61s]  This castle, sometimes I wonder if it's all just a big joke.
[689.61s -> 694.22s]  Probably is.
[694.22s -> 696.22s]  What'd I say, I need at least like a thousand gold
[696.22s -> 699.99s]  for this run to be okay.
[699.99s -> 702.55s]  I'm gonna try and make my way to the right.
[702.55s -> 704.92s]  Oh boy, no, this is like the harder area.
[704.92s -> 706.92s]  The dark blue is, if I'm not mistaken,
[706.92s -> 709.48s]  like level G.
[709.48s -> 711.48s]  These things are like level 38. I can take them.
[711.48s -> 714.47s]  I can take them.
[714.47s -> 717.22s]  They do a lot of damage though.
[717.22s -> 719.22s]  And how you level up in this game, you're probably not noticing
[719.22s -> 721.22s]  any experience bar.
[721.22s -> 723.22s]  And that's something I was pretty confused on myself as well.
[723.22s -> 725.53s]  You level up in this game
[725.53s -> 727.53s]  by doing upgrades
[727.53s -> 729.53s]  to your castle.
[729.53s -> 731.83s]  So for each upgrade you do to the castle,
[731.83s -> 734.33s]  defeat all enemies.
[734.33s -> 736.63s]  Oh, I can't, yep, I can't kill them.
[736.63s -> 738.87s]  Unless I had one of the different spells,
[738.87s -> 741.62s]  I cannot do this.
[741.62s -> 743.62s]  I have a randomly rolled character like you get in this game.
[743.62s -> 745.99s]  And I want to show you that,
[745.99s -> 748.49s]  because it's pretty hilarious.
[748.49s -> 750.66s]  But I can't do anything over there.
[750.66s -> 752.66s]  We're gonna stay up in this harder area,
[752.66s -> 754.97s]  because I feel like I'm being a wuss.
[754.97s -> 756.97s]  I have a level 65 right now,
[756.97s -> 758.97s]  and I'm staying away from the higher zones.
[758.97s -> 763.56s]  Yikes!
[763.56s -> 768.73s]  Get away!
[768.73s -> 772.44s]  Critical hit, got plenty of money.
[772.44s -> 774.44s]  Get outta here, Skellington.
[774.44s -> 779.62s]  Get outta here, Jack Skellington.
[779.62s -> 781.62s]  The Nightmare Before Christmas 2, Jack Skellington returns.
[781.62s -> 784.95s]  Level 44, this guy's gonna be a pain.
[784.95s -> 787.38s]  Get over here!
[787.38s -> 789.38s]  Come on, I'm a knight, you're a knight.
[789.38s -> 792.97s]  Let's knight it out. What? What?
[792.97s -> 796.04s]  Whatever, I'll just magic you to death, you punk.
[796.04s -> 798.60s]  I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
[798.60s -> 801.03s]  In this next area. Yep.
[801.03s -> 804.30s]  Goodbye. Oh, if I kill him though.
[804.30s -> 806.92s]  Nooo!
[806.92s -> 810.44s]  What the fu-
[810.44s -> 812.44s]  Okay, so we died, so now let's talk about death,
[812.44s -> 814.44s]  because death is actually pretty important
[814.44s -> 816.81s]  to progress through this game.
[816.81s -> 818.81s]  So that character just died, that was a knight.
[818.81s -> 821.24s]  And I'm back at the title screen now.
[821.24s -> 823.24s]  So I hit A, choose your heir.
[823.24s -> 825.67s]  And here are all the people that have died.
[825.67s -> 827.98s]  These are all the children before these children.
[829.98s -> 832.15s]  So this is the new blood, so to speak.
[832.15s -> 834.15s]  And if you look at them.
[834.15s -> 836.15s]  So class paladin, traits none.
[836.15s -> 838.50s]  Class archmage,
[838.50s -> 840.50s]  like I said, I've been building up some mages.
[840.50s -> 842.50s]  A powerful spellcaster, every hit gives you mana.
[842.50s -> 844.68s]  Trait, colorblind.
[844.68s -> 846.68s]  Now this is really important.
[846.68s -> 848.98s]  I can't see colors with this character.
[848.98s -> 850.98s]  If I pick this character,
[850.98s -> 852.98s]  the screen's gonna be black and white.
[852.98s -> 854.98s]  And everything far away is gonna be blurry.
[854.98s -> 857.16s]  All of your children,
[857.16s -> 859.16s]  after you die,
[859.16s -> 861.34s]  some of them can have, like, diseases.
[861.34s -> 863.34s]  And some of them can have, like, quirks.
[863.34s -> 865.34s]  And some of them can be different.
[865.34s -> 867.34s]  And that's one of the coolest things about this game.
[867.34s -> 869.34s]  Is the randomly rolled children you get.
[869.34s -> 871.70s]  So this guy, this guy has tunnel vision.
[871.70s -> 873.70s]  No peripheral vision.
[873.70s -> 875.70s]  And he has IBS.
[875.70s -> 877.70s]  He, like, FOTS.
[877.70s -> 880.38s]  Like, it's just so cool.
[880.38s -> 882.38s]  So we're gonna go ahead and pick, cause I cannot handle
[882.38s -> 884.74s]  playing the game with no colors.
[884.74s -> 887.11s]  It drives me insane.
[887.11s -> 889.11s]  I gotta pick one of these three. And I don't wanna pick the paladin.
[889.11s -> 891.11s]  Cause that's not really what I'm building.
[891.11s -> 893.61s]  So I wanna build the mage.
[893.61s -> 896.23s]  Let's pick that mage with the diarrhea.
[896.23s -> 898.60s]  And let's upgrade something.
[898.60s -> 901.99s]  So, probably use a little more HP.
[901.99s -> 903.99s]  Or I could do some more magic damage
[903.99s -> 905.99s]  for my mages. Let's go ahead and do that.
[905.99s -> 908.49s]  So right now, this is gonna upgrade.
[908.49s -> 910.49s]  Out of 75, by the way.
[910.49s -> 912.86s]  I got five points in here. Boink.
[912.86s -> 914.86s]  So that means my mages are gonna do more damage
[914.86s -> 917.54s]  with their spells. Pretty cool.
[917.54s -> 919.54s]  Okay, so now let me show you what I was talking about before.
[919.54s -> 922.23s]  I go up to this lady. This is the rune lady.
[922.23s -> 924.66s]  And I found some of those runes.
[924.66s -> 926.66s]  Here are the good ones, the new ones I found, apparently.
[926.66s -> 929.16s]  So spirit rune, this is a dash.
[929.16s -> 931.16s]  So if I equip this, I have this one.
[931.16s -> 933.16s]  You can only have one equipped per slot.
[933.16s -> 935.59s]  So I can only activate one of these.
[935.59s -> 937.59s]  And of course I have to buy these.
[937.59s -> 940.09s]  I have not bought them yet.
[940.09s -> 942.09s]  So this one, for instance, is when I kill someone
[942.09s -> 944.33s]  I get its life leech. I get health.
[944.33s -> 946.33s]  I get a couple HP points if this is turned on.
[946.33s -> 948.76s]  But if I turn this on,
[948.76s -> 951.00s]  that means I do not have this turned on,
[951.00s -> 953.00s]  which is a double jump.
[953.00s -> 955.62s]  And if I don't have that on,
[955.62s -> 957.62s]  that means I can't turn this on,
[957.62s -> 959.62s]  which makes the enemies scale slower and make them easier.
[959.62s -> 961.86s]  So there's a lot here.
[961.86s -> 964.36s]  Coins give more gold. Oh my god.
[964.36s -> 966.36s]  I want this so bad. I'm gonna have to unlock that next.
[966.36s -> 969.18s]  So it's very, very deep.
[969.18s -> 971.18s]  For as simple a game as it pretty much is,
[971.18s -> 973.48s]  there's a lot to it.
[973.48s -> 975.66s]  And you can stack these runes.
[975.66s -> 977.66s]  So let's say I have
[977.66s -> 979.66s]  all my bracers here.
[979.66s -> 981.66s]  These are the bracers I have on.
[981.66s -> 983.66s]  Vampire rune.
[983.66s -> 985.66s]  And I have Vampire rune on my helmet as well.
[985.66s -> 987.66s]  So that's even more HP per kill.
[987.66s -> 989.83s]  And if I have it on my sword,
[989.83s -> 991.83s]  that's even more HP per kill.
[991.83s -> 994.26s]  So you can really build cool characters.
[994.26s -> 997.14s]  And this guy,
[997.14s -> 999.14s]  what this guy does is he makes it so
[999.14s -> 1001.14s]  the dungeon, like I said,
[1001.14s -> 1003.32s]  is randomly generated.
[1003.32s -> 1005.32s]  He makes it so the dungeon is not randomly generated.
[1005.32s -> 1007.50s]  But I get 70% money.
[1007.50s -> 1009.50s]  I lose 30% gold.
[1009.50s -> 1011.50s]  So he locks down the dungeon for you.
[1011.50s -> 1013.50s]  If you know, if you remember where everything was,
[1013.50s -> 1015.50s]  and you don't care about taking a money hit,
[1015.50s -> 1017.93s]  you can talk to that asshole right there.
[1017.93s -> 1019.93s]  But we're gonna keep moving.
