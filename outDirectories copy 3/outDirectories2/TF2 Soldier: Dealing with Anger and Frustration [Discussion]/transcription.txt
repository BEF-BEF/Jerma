[0.31s -> 22.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and today gonna be playing as the I'm not sure because I have not recorded it yet and that's gonna be the topic of this video.
[22.50s -> 27.50s]  I've been having a pretty bad week the last four or five days or so you probably saw on Twitter.
[27.50s -> 42.50s]  A lot of things just are not clicking for me right now and the most recent thing that has been a little bit on the like WTF son of a bitch like throw a friggin glass vase into the wall and have it explode and have like the shots of glass go everywhere and stick it.
[43.50s -> 66.87s]  I lost everything on my hard drive last night and I wouldn't normally be that upset about this because I usually back stuff up but because of packs and because of all the head injury BS I had I didn't really think about it and the one like week that I didn't back up my files of course is the week where everything goes kaput and it sucks.
[66.87s -> 79.11s]  It really does because there was a lot of great footage I had recorded I don't want to you know say what videos they were because I don't want to get anybody's hopes up because there were some really cool things I was working on and they're just gone now so I'm going to move on from that.
[79.11s -> 95.59s]  I want to talk about the actual purpose of this video and it's building frustrations and how to stop from freaking out because I got pretty close when this happened I was really goddamn close to like I said I have a lamp sitting on my desk.
[95.59s -> 108.59s]  I grabbed it by the neck the lamp neck and I was about to swing it around like a friggin lasso and throw it into the wall that's almost happened I almost did that because like I said I had a lot of cool things I was working on but I didn't do it.
[108.59s -> 120.59s]  I took a step back and I said it's not worth doing that I don't want to like rage delete my wall because that's what would have happened it would have been like a thousand dollar repair because this thing's pretty heavy it's a pretty big lamp.
[120.59s -> 136.09s]  I don't think you guys ever seen that I don't think you've ever seen it on a webcam or anything like that but it's it's fairly large and heavy and that would have been even worse even more adding to my troubles this week but it got me thinking when the world seems like it does not want you to do anything.
[136.09s -> 166.09s]  When the world is like you got the earth planet earth is sitting up in the sky we're all on it and it's got a face and it's just saying to itself you know this like two week period you know screw germa 985 let's just like kill him let's just like throw him down a flight of stairs delete his hard drive and like stick a broom up his ass except that that didn't happen the broom part I mean but when it feels like the world is out to get you for a certain amount of time you can build up a lot of frustration you can try to find a way to vent it out and I think I found this
[166.09s -> 186.46s]  solution and the solution is there is no solution you have to suck it up and you have to keep going as weird as that sounds as bad advice as that sounds there is no solution to bad outcomes to bad solutions if your hard drive gets deleted and you try to do the recovery options and everything fails that's
[186.46s -> 202.46s]  it it's gone if you take a dive into a wall and you smash your head into a wall and you have stitches in your face it's over you cannot time travel there is no such thing as time travel you cannot go back in time and change anything as much as you desperately wish you could you just can't.
[202.46s -> 233.37s]  And until Bill Gates designs a time machine or Steve Jobs wait Steve Jobs is dead well until somebody makes a time machine this is all not possible so what you have to do is what I did today and that's remove yourself completely from the frustrating situation if it's a bunch of different things then you're going to have to try and find your happy place somewhere go to the pizza parlor go to like Burger King and just go sit down and relax for a second if you have an injury like
[233.37s -> 263.54s]  I do or something don't look in don't even look in the mirror and say man my head looks like shit don't even do that just walk away and pretend like it's not even there same thing with like I said a computer problem I was sitting in this chair for 45 minutes straight pointing with an open hand in the middle of the screen going why why did this happen what the hell what the and then after like I said 45 minutes went by I said what what am I doing here like this is not going to solve the problem me pointing angrily at the screen
[263.54s -> 293.98s]  is not going to solve my hard drive problem it's over you have to deal with it and you have to move on and I brought this up in how ironic guys I brought the same topic up a couple videos ago when I talked about my stitches and it still is true after four or five days of frustration and we all have our ways of dealing with frustration we all have our ways of venting so to speak and it might not be a bad idea to pick up something like a punching bag or one of those things I see on TV sometimes it's been a while but it's
[293.98s -> 324.73s]  a legitimate dummy that you punch in the face like that's what it's designed for you to do it's a workout machine but screw that I just want to beat up the dummy and I get my like anger out because obviously the desk and like the lamp and the computer screen you do not want to break those things you just want to vent your frustration and your anger so it's probably a good idea I might have you know I'm doing it I'm gonna buy one of those dummies so I can kick his ass every like couple weeks when I feel down but to wrap up this video I want to open the comment section up
[324.73s -> 354.73s]  to you guys and we'll have a little venting session I guess something in the last week or a couple weeks or a couple months doesn't matter the time frame something that really pissed you off or that you're dealing with right now vent in the comments if you're comfortable I like to see some of the different situations a lot of you guys are going through and maybe I'll add a couple things to the discussion as well because we're all venting together this is like group therapy with Jerma so leave me whatever you want guys in the comment section and hopefully I can get some more videos out here soon I had a lot of stuff
[354.73s -> 366.15s]  planned and yes it sucks really badly but where's my dummy let's go kick his ass dummy where you at I'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody
