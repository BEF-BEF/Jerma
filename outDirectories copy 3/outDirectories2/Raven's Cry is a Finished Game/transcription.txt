[8.06s -> 10.62s]  This guy looks like he's waiting for a bus.
[13.14s -> 14.14s]  Get out of my way.
[15.64s -> 16.64s]  Yeah, fuck you.
[18.94s -> 20.14s]  This is the same person talking.
[21.45s -> 24.95s]  I didn't even do that. I didn't even do that. Why? I did not press any button to hit him.
[25.25s -> 25.95s]  He just hit him.
[43.39s -> 48.39s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49.39s -> 52.55s]  So what's next?
[62.88s -> 64.88s]  Alright, this really does sound like...
[65.88s -> 68.88s]  This sounds like somebody was just at a bar drinking with their buddies.
[69.88s -> 71.88s]  And held a microphone in front of someone, one of their friends.
[71.88s -> 72.88s]  Which is like, hey, can you...
[76.13s -> 78.63s]  Can you do like a fucking shitty pirate voice for me?
[81.63s -> 84.90s]  Be brave, son of a bitches.
[85.90s -> 87.90s]  Alright, this swear guy is seriously driving me crazy.
[89.20s -> 91.20s]  Be brave, motherfuckers.
[91.20s -> 92.20s]  This is all he does.
[93.20s -> 96.20s]  There's a guy on this boat that's just saying a variation of the same insult.
[97.20s -> 99.20s]  Be brave, pile of shit.
[100.20s -> 103.20s]  He's telling us to be brave in the same sentence. He's calling us names.
[104.20s -> 105.20s]  Which one is it?
[106.63s -> 107.63s]  Be brave, fuckers.
[114.25s -> 115.25s]  We're sinking.
[115.25s -> 116.25s]  We don't die today, you bitches.
[121.30s -> 133.51s]  Well, first I'm going to stab him.
[134.51s -> 135.51s]  And then I'm going to butt him.
[135.51s -> 136.51s]  And then I'm going to butt him again.
[137.51s -> 138.51s]  And then I'm going to butt him again.
[138.51s -> 139.51s]  And then I'm going to stab him.
[139.51s -> 140.51s]  And then I'm going to stab him.
[141.51s -> 146.50s]  I guess a cup of drinks would make me think that it's all out.
[147.50s -> 151.47s]  Why does he keep telling me to do the fear skill?
[152.47s -> 153.47s]  Who do I have to...
[153.47s -> 154.47s]  I did not mean to shoot that guy.
[154.47s -> 155.47s]  Didn't mean to kill that guy.
[155.47s -> 157.47s]  I really didn't. I'm trying to do the fear skill.
[158.47s -> 159.47s]  Nobody seems to care though.
[159.47s -> 160.47s]  Apparently that guy...
[161.47s -> 162.47s]  Nobody cares about that guy.
[162.47s -> 163.47s]  Everyone's cool.
[163.47s -> 164.47s]  All right, we're good.
[164.47s -> 168.18s]  Look, a guy sleeping on the dock.
[168.18s -> 169.18s]  What do you know?
[169.18s -> 170.49s]  Hey, who's got a gun here?
[170.49s -> 171.49s]  You're going to put a gun on me?
[171.49s -> 172.49s]  Are you crazy, man?
[172.49s -> 173.49s]  That thing put somebody's eye out.
[173.49s -> 175.49s]  I'm tired. I'm going back to bed.
[175.49s -> 176.49s]  I think I'm good.
[176.49s -> 177.49s]  Wait, you got a gun still?
[177.49s -> 178.49s]  Oh my God.
[178.49s -> 179.49s]  You're going to kill somebody with that thing.
[179.49s -> 180.49s]  I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.
[180.49s -> 181.49s]  I'm not tired anymore.
[181.49s -> 182.49s]  You think I'm tired?
[182.49s -> 183.49s]  No, I am tired.
[183.49s -> 185.49s]  No, I'm going to wake up now because you got a gun.
[185.49s -> 186.49s]  This guy's crazy.
[186.49s -> 187.49s]  I'm tired again.
[187.49s -> 188.49s]  No, I'm not tired.
[188.49s -> 189.49s]  You think I'm tired?
[189.49s -> 190.49s]  Fuck you.
[190.49s -> 191.49s]  I'm tired again.
[191.49s -> 192.49s]  Oh, hey.
[192.49s -> 195.05s]  I don't want to fight these guys.
[195.05s -> 199.54s]  I'm riding around like a dinghy boat and these guys are shooting like 300.
[199.54s -> 201.54s]  Oh my God.
[201.54s -> 205.55s]  There's no way I'm going to be able to fight these guys.
[205.55s -> 207.55s]  I just like 2%.
[207.55s -> 209.55s]  I did like not even 1% damage.
[209.55s -> 211.55s]  We're like instantly getting killed.
[211.55s -> 213.73s]  I can't even turn the wheel.
[213.73s -> 217.82s]  You need me.
[217.82s -> 220.07s]  No.
[220.07s -> 224.22s]  What?
[224.22s -> 226.22s]  Who's saying you need me?
[226.22s -> 231.31s]  Why is that the fucking reverse of beer?
[231.31s -> 232.62s]  Yeah.
[232.62s -> 233.62s]  No.
[233.62s -> 236.26s]  No.
[236.26s -> 239.17s]  Oh shit.
[239.17s -> 240.17s]  There's a prisoner in here.
[240.17s -> 243.86s]  Get me out of here.
[243.86s -> 245.86s]  That's not a very secure prison.
[245.86s -> 248.45s]  Excuse me.
[248.45s -> 250.45s]  Just go the other way.
[250.45s -> 252.45s]  Could I use half a crown now?
[252.45s -> 253.45s]  I don't even know what that means.
[253.45s -> 255.45s]  You just said a nonsense statement.
[255.45s -> 256.45s]  Just please go out the door.
[256.45s -> 257.45s]  I'm sorry.
[257.45s -> 258.45s]  I'm on my way.
[258.45s -> 259.75s]  Get on your way.
[259.75s -> 260.75s]  Go.
[260.75s -> 262.75s]  I'm going to block this side of the door so you have to fucking go this way.
[262.75s -> 264.12s]  I'm sorry.
[264.12s -> 265.12s]  I'm on my way.
[265.12s -> 268.09s]  Go.
[268.09s -> 269.09s]  Turd sniffer?
[269.09s -> 271.09s]  Did you just call me a turd sniffer?
[271.09s -> 279.78s]  They're all like bumbling all over each other and like saying excuse me and like oh I don't
[279.78s -> 280.78s]  want any trouble.
[280.78s -> 286.89s]  Whoa.
[286.89s -> 287.89s]  Oh.
[287.89s -> 288.89s]  Oh.
[288.89s -> 290.83s]  God.
[290.83s -> 291.83s]  Dude.
[291.83s -> 292.83s]  I can't beat this.
[292.83s -> 294.26s]  I can't beat this like hen house.
[294.26s -> 297.26s]  That's all I hear.
[297.26s -> 300.26s]  Literally that's all I fucking hear right now.
[300.26s -> 302.26s]  It's making me want to die.
[302.26s -> 303.76s]  Go.
[303.76s -> 304.76s]  Go.
[304.76s -> 307.79s]  Go.
[307.79s -> 308.79s]  Go.
[308.79s -> 310.35s]  Did I get out?
[310.35s -> 313.42s]  What is that nightmare?
[313.42s -> 318.01s]  You cannot be serious right now.
[318.01s -> 319.01s]  What?
[319.01s -> 321.01s]  Wait a second.
[321.01s -> 337.75s]  Don't even tell me.
[337.75s -> 340.76s]  Is this lady?
[340.76s -> 341.76s]  What?
[341.76s -> 342.76s]  No.
[342.76s -> 348.93s]  Yeah this is a lady pissing into a bush.
[348.93s -> 349.93s]  God they keep tempting me.
[349.93s -> 351.93s]  Stop tempting me with this.
[351.93s -> 352.93s]  Come on.
[352.93s -> 354.93s]  I like don't want to do this.
[354.93s -> 358.93s]  They keep putting them in the perfect spot for you to push them off the giant scaffolding.
[358.93s -> 364.00s]  Do you have any idea how hard it is to not do that?
[364.00s -> 365.00s]  Look.
[365.00s -> 366.00s]  Again.
[366.00s -> 367.00s]  And this guy.
[367.00s -> 369.26s]  This guy's pissing.
[369.26s -> 370.26s]  No he's not.
[370.26s -> 371.26s]  What is this guy doing?
[371.26s -> 374.49s]  Oh he's throwing up.
[374.49s -> 376.49s]  He's throwing up into an invisible ground.
[376.49s -> 384.30s]  I don't know why.
[384.30s -> 387.30s]  Wait was that the guy I was supposed to talk to?
[387.30s -> 390.88s]  Mind the sodding cannibals.
[390.88s -> 392.88s]  You guys notice something?
[392.88s -> 396.66s]  Anything seem a little off to you guys?
[396.66s -> 397.66s]  At all?
[397.66s -> 398.66s]  Just listen.
[398.66s -> 406.46s]  I found you cowards.
[406.46s -> 408.46s]  They patched him out of the game.
[408.46s -> 411.46s]  The last clip you saw was like two and a half days ago.
[411.46s -> 413.46s]  They removed.
[413.46s -> 415.46s]  This is all new dialogue on the boat.
[415.46s -> 418.46s]  Anytime you go on the boat now it's this.
[418.46s -> 419.46s]  What were the patch notes?
[419.46s -> 423.46s]  Did they say like oh we removed these scream swears be brave guy.
[423.46s -> 428.46s]  We apologize for his uncalled for insults.
[428.46s -> 429.46s]  And he has been removed.
[429.46s -> 430.46s]  I want him back.
[430.46s -> 431.46s]  Where is he?
[431.46s -> 433.46s]  He was an integral part of my crew.
