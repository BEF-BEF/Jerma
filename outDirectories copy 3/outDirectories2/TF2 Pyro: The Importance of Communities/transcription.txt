[0.31s -> 16.44s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, gonna be playing as the Pyro.
[16.44s -> 23.44s]  Now, this is not gonna be one straight gameplay in a row. It's gonna be a few clips of the Pyro back to back on various maps,
[23.44s -> 27.44s]  but just a couple of streaks here and there that I got with the Extinguisher and the Flare Gun.
[27.44s -> 33.44s]  You guys know the deal, but I'm using the Strange Degreaser, the Flare Gun, like I said, and the Extinguisher.
[34.74s -> 41.74s]  So the topic of this gameplay is going to be about communities, gameplay communities, or really communities in general,
[41.74s -> 49.74s]  and how they shape the world of gaming and why they are so important, and especially a game like Team Fortress 2, which is pretty old.
[49.74s -> 55.74s]  And I've done community videos before talking about, you know, why TF2 is lasting so long or why games are worth playing,
[55.74s -> 66.92s]  but I want to focus mostly on communities as a whole and why they need to be strengthened from the core to continue on in their legacy of their game franchises,
[66.92s -> 73.35s]  or just in general, just in the world of gaming. So let me define what I mean by the word community.
[73.35s -> 78.35s]  I know it has probably a couple of different contexts and a couple of different things, but this is what I see it as.
[78.35s -> 84.35s]  A community is a group of people that are all collectively in the same area or in the same interest field,
[84.35s -> 93.35s]  that are all trying to coexist together and strengthen themselves from the inside out to be a better place or a better group of people.
[93.35s -> 100.35s]  Now, gaming communities in specific here are very, very important to a game's lifespan.
[100.35s -> 103.35s]  I'm going to bring up Team Fortress 2, because of course we're playing Team Fortress 2.
[103.35s -> 107.35s]  Team Fortress 2 has lasted this long mainly because of its community.
[107.35s -> 112.35s]  Valve has done a great job of putting out all these updates and giving us all this free stuff
[112.35s -> 115.35s]  and giving us all these great things to play with in their games,
[115.35s -> 119.35s]  but it really is the people playing the reason why it's still going,
[119.35s -> 124.78s]  because if you don't have people playing the game, you don't have that active demand from the whole group of players,
[124.78s -> 128.78s]  there's no reason to keep supporting a title. You move on to the next big thing.
[128.78s -> 135.09s]  And really, this is where we come in. We do things like make mods for games or game mode modifications.
[135.09s -> 138.09s]  We make content, video content, like you're watching right now.
[138.09s -> 141.09s]  There's a lot of people that make YouTube videos on gaming content.
[141.09s -> 147.39s]  And even with something like the Steam Workshop, which adds items and artwork and 3D modeling into the game.
[147.39s -> 152.39s]  So you've got a lot of things going on with a community that if they were not there, think about this for a second.
[152.39s -> 159.76s]  If those things that I just mentioned were not there, would something like Team Fortress 2 have died years ago?
[159.76s -> 165.06s]  And the answer is I'm not sure, because Valve, like I said, has been actively updating this game
[165.06s -> 169.06s]  and actively putting a lot of developer support into it, that it's hard to tell.
[169.06s -> 177.06s]  But can you imagine a world where there was no Saxton Hale, there was no crazy mod servers with Prop Hunt or Balloon Race,
[177.06s -> 181.06s]  or nobody putting Steam Workshop items on the marketplace and having you go click and vote and watch
[181.06s -> 186.06s]  and see all the cool new things coming through the pipeline, if there were no YouTube videos, if people didn't make gaming?
[186.06s -> 191.06s]  And this is not just Team Fortress 2 exclusive. I have no idea what would happen.
[191.06s -> 196.06s]  But what I do know is when we get interested in something, it sparks interest from the developers.
[196.06s -> 200.06s]  When the developer gets sparked interest from the community, they start to make more stuff.
[200.06s -> 206.06s]  When they make more stuff, people buy it potentially, or they start playing more, the company makes more money, so on and so forth.
[206.06s -> 211.43s]  It is a love-love relationship that cannot really be broken.
[211.43s -> 219.67s]  And unfortunately, I can probably name you a handful of franchises that have really, really bad, bad relationships with their communities.
[219.67s -> 226.67s]  And you see this clash of heads all the time between developers and the people playing, it can get so out of hand.
[226.67s -> 232.67s]  People asking for bug fixes that never happen and content patches that are expensive and they don't really add a whole lot.
[232.67s -> 234.67s]  It's really bad sometimes.
[234.67s -> 242.91s]  But it is so important to have that backbone of people pushing for something because it allows you to shape the games you love to play.
[242.91s -> 250.09s]  As a group, as a collective, we have a voice that if it gets ignored in a lot of these cases with the developers not listening,
[250.09s -> 254.26s]  it causes massive problems because we won't buy the next game that comes out.
[254.26s -> 258.26s]  We won't pay for the really expensive DLC.
[258.26s -> 261.26s]  We won't do these things and it hurts the company.
[261.26s -> 264.26s]  If they don't play ball, play ball.
[264.26s -> 271.26s]  If they don't play ball, then we have a little bit of power because we won't do the things that they're asking us to do.
[271.26s -> 275.63s]  And a little earlier I brought up mods and game modifications and stuff like that.
[275.63s -> 281.63s]  And those are so awesome because it gets to, it lets people, when game companies, let me say this first,
[281.63s -> 288.63s]  when game companies allow us use of their game code to create new things and new ideas,
[288.63s -> 291.63s]  it is such an incredible thing for the whole collective.
[291.63s -> 293.63s]  It is unbelievable.
[293.63s -> 300.63s]  And I actually have a really big problem with companies that take their game code or take their stance on modifications and game changes and stuff.
[300.63s -> 304.63s]  And they put it in a box, close it and lock it and throw the key in the backyard.
[304.63s -> 310.63s]  I have a big problem with that because what you're effectively doing is we brought up having a voice in the community.
[310.63s -> 316.63s]  You're essentially silencing everybody and not letting anyone have an imagination with your fantastic product.
[316.63s -> 321.81s]  Because, I mean, a lot of people spend, I understand the argument that these companies put a lot of time in their work.
[321.81s -> 324.81s]  They don't want their game code to be exploited.
[324.81s -> 329.81s]  It's an intellectual property and it's copyrighted and sorry, screw you, go deal with it.
[329.81s -> 338.05s]  But I can name you three franchises right now that started as mods that became major, major wild successes.
[338.05s -> 339.05s]  Here you go.
[339.05s -> 340.05s]  League of Legends.
[340.05s -> 345.42s]  All those MOBA games started in Warcraft 3 as a Warcraft 3 custom map.
[345.42s -> 347.59s]  You've got something like DayZ.
[347.59s -> 349.59s]  DayZ is a mod.
[349.59s -> 352.59s]  And then you've got a little game called Team Fortress 2.
[352.59s -> 354.59s]  Team Fortress was a Quake mod.
[354.59s -> 359.59s]  Can you imagine if Quake did not allow mods to their games?
[359.59s -> 362.59s]  We would not even have Team Fortress 2.
[362.59s -> 363.59s]  And that's the point I'm going to make.
[363.59s -> 364.59s]  I'm going to end on that, guys.
[364.59s -> 366.59s]  And that's going to wrap up the video.
[366.59s -> 369.59s]  So let me know in the comments section what you think about all this.
[369.59s -> 370.59s]  And we will go from there.
[370.59s -> 372.59s]  Community, stay strong, baby.
[372.59s -> 373.59s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[373.59s -> 375.59s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
