[0.31s -> 13.76s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some more...what the hell was that?
[13.76s -> 19.76s]  Some more Call of Duty Black Ops 2 party games. This one is actually called Sticks and Stones.
[19.76s -> 26.94s]  Where you only get to use ballistic knives, knives, and the crossbow. This thing.
[26.94s -> 36.64s]  Oh, get stuck. This is on that boat map again. For a second I thought that was an actual plate.
[36.64s -> 43.50s]  Get stuck. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Guy right here. Come here.
[43.50s -> 52.87s]  Just double tap him. Whoa. Whoa. Those things explode. Yikes.
[52.87s -> 58.30s]  I'm going up there. I'm coming up there, man. I'm going to give you a Christmas card that you're going to want to send back.
[58.30s -> 66.92s]  Iron explosion. Yeah, melee kill. Can I jump down there?
[66.92s -> 74.13s]  Oh, you also get the tomahawk too with a throwing knife. I'm going to throw this guy right in the back.
[74.13s -> 81.94s]  Or in the front. Or in his face. That works too. Pull this back out. This thing.
[81.94s -> 97.09s]  Oh, I don't know where to go. Shoot down. Let's just shoot down that hallway just to scare him.
[97.09s -> 103.16s]  Oh man. Did I get a double? Oh, I thought it went through the guy. Wow. Oh my.
[103.16s -> 110.66s]  Dude, my face. I just planted my face into the wall. That was ridiculous.
[110.66s -> 116.22s]  Holy crap. That was insanity. Get tomahawked. Nobody was even there.
[116.22s -> 126.70s]  There's a dude in there. He's sitting right here.
[126.70s -> 137.30s]  Screw this. No. That thing is terrifying. I'm just going to use the ballistic knives, man. These things are deadly.
[137.30s -> 144.54s]  Oh, come on. No, please don't kill me. No. Stab him. Reload.
[144.54s -> 160.04s]  What's this? Oh, you got smashed. I'm going to take this out.
[160.04s -> 165.71s]  I don't like that thing. That thing's... I'm not good with that thing.
[165.71s -> 171.55s]  Skewered. I don't have any more bullets with it though. Or ammo.
[171.55s -> 177.22s]  Oh, with the knives. Not this thing. Now I've got to use this thing. I don't even want to use this thing.
[177.22s -> 189.59s]  Got him. Oh, bang. Hello. Oh boy. Screw it. I got one of them.
[189.59s -> 198.30s]  At least I got my ballistics back. These things are where it's at. Oh, someone's going to get it.
[198.30s -> 203.14s]  I'm just going to throw it over the whole map and see what happens.
[203.14s -> 207.96s]  If I get a kill for that, that would be so hilarious.
[207.96s -> 214.71s]  Dammit. Whoa. Whoa. Easy. Easy, buddy. Easy. Easy.
[214.71s -> 220.62s]  What? That guy was running...
[220.62s -> 223.79s]  When does this end? How long are the rounds? These things are pretty damn long.
[223.79s -> 231.08s]  You're wrapping back around. Are you? Oh, get bankrupted.
[231.08s -> 235.98s]  This guy's got that explosive scary thing.
[235.98s -> 247.52s]  What on earth is happening right now? Oh, get blown up. Get blown up.
[247.52s -> 250.52s]  You son of a bitch. It was... people surrounded me.
[250.52s -> 258.58s]  Get tomahawked. I don't even know if I'm winning or not. Am I? Apparently I'm winning.
[258.58s -> 273.42s]  Geez. There's a lot of human beings over here. I would have had that kill too. Bastard.
[273.42s -> 282.53s]  Dammit. Should have paid more attention. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[282.53s -> 293.56s]  Oh, hit him with that. You're just going to get stabbed. What? What?
[293.56s -> 301.17s]  All right. That works too. Seven seconds. Six, five, four, three, two, one.
[301.17s -> 307.61s]  Oh, is that it? Hey, I won. Fruit snacks, baby. That was crazy.
[307.61s -> 313.62s]  That was absolutely crazy. But let's do one more. Let's do another one.
[313.62s -> 328.48s]  Let's get off this boat level. Connection interrupted. What the hell? Bang.
[328.48s -> 332.48s]  I have some delivery for you. Extra special package.
[332.48s -> 338.09s]  I don't want to run into these... I love these things, man. I don't want to run out of them.
[338.09s -> 348.57s]  Bankrupt. Bankrupt. I'll just run around with these damn things.
[348.57s -> 356.12s]  Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. He's still behind me.
[356.12s -> 366.59s]  Holy crap. Just... Oh. What are these? Shoot me in the face?
[366.59s -> 372.99s]  What the hell was that? It's all good. Let's come out here and do it again.
[378.96s -> 386.52s]  I'm going to stab you in your face. You're going to get stabbed right in your face.
[386.52s -> 394.58s]  I'm going to stab. I'm going to stab. You're going to get freaking...
[394.58s -> 401.84s]  Where is this guy? Oh, he's over here. Get him.
[401.84s -> 406.59s]  No. No. Watch it. Please don't hurt me. Please don't kill me.
[406.59s -> 412.54s]  Geez Louise with a piece of cheese. Oh, that guy's alive. That guy's dead, I mean.
[412.54s -> 420.66s]  Chaos. There's another guy. Did I get him? Oh my God. Run.
[420.66s -> 425.28s]  Oh, did I get... I didn't get anybody. Damn it.
[425.28s -> 434.88s]  At least I got the tomahawk. Wow. Somebody behind me trying to kill me.
[434.88s -> 443.46s]  How did that not work? Who did I just kill?
[443.46s -> 454.68s]  Apparently one of them got killed. Keep running. Keep moving. Keep moving.
[454.68s -> 463.04s]  Keep moving. What? No. No. What do we got? I'm winning?
[463.04s -> 477.61s]  I was winning. Skewered. I'm so scared.
[477.61s -> 485.48s]  Try using this thing again. At least for a minute or two or three or four.
[485.48s -> 492.66s]  Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
[492.66s -> 498.99s]  What? Some dude was just like up my ass. Maybe not. Where the hell was that guy?
[498.99s -> 510.94s]  That was weird. Sticks and stones. Sticks and stones.
[510.94s -> 518.82s]  Damn. Right here. This guy. Right here.
[518.82s -> 524.79s]  Ow. I'm losing. I gotta pull this together here. Come on.
[524.79s -> 536.00s]  Come on. Pull it together. You laggy son of a bitch. Come here.
[536.00s -> 543.30s]  Come on. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep it going. Keep it going.
[543.30s -> 551.13s]  Still losing. Still losing. But can I pull it through?
[551.13s -> 555.13s]  How in the name of Jehoshaphat did I not kill that guy?
[555.13s -> 561.59s]  I was sticking the knife in the back of his head. Nothing happened.
[561.59s -> 571.64s]  You know what? Screw it Tomahawk. Explosions. Anybody over here?
[571.64s -> 578.92s]  Yeah there is. Take down that guy. No idea where I am.
[578.92s -> 583.92s]  I'm like freaking Superman. It's tied. It's tied. I gotta pull ahead.
[583.92s -> 592.14s]  No. No. No. No. I gotta pull ahead. I only have a few seconds.
[592.14s -> 602.66s]  No. I gotta get this guy. Gotta get him. What? What? What was that?
[602.66s -> 608.28s]  The guy just like... Really bro? You're gonna drop shot in sticks and stones?
[608.28s -> 618.49s]  Oh my god. I won. I actually won. Well there you go. Nice.
[618.49s -> 623.44s]  I didn't get the last kill though. But yeah that's gonna wrap it up I guess guys.
[623.44s -> 627.44s]  So thank you so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. Sticks and stones baby.
[627.44s -> 632.62s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
