[0.25s -> 19.75s]  Let's get, let's get warmed up. Let's get, get warmed up. This is too offensive for cameras. Turn the camera off. Don't show it, don't blur it. Don't show, blur it out.
[19.75s -> 29.87s]  Okay guys, welcome to a video. So Ster and I have realized that trying to play a game like this and talk, it always ends in disaster.
[29.87s -> 38.04s]  So we're just gonna try our little pants off as the two characters who know how to play. If somebody makes a noise, you know what I mean?
[38.04s -> 41.79s]  If somebody says a word, then you got it. You know what I mean?
[41.79s -> 45.79s]  This video is going to be 95% silent and every once in a while we're gonna go.
[45.79s -> 51.42s]  Yeah, so first we're gonna do a little just to check here. Make sure your connections are connected.
[51.42s -> 54.72s]  Okay, so commence the tri- no.
[54.72s -> 56.54s]  You said commence.
[56.54s -> 59.54s]  Commence means end, by the way. I figured that out the other day.
[59.54s -> 60.54s]  Does it really?
[60.54s -> 66.54s]  The other day? What the fuck am I talking about? Tri-Hod mode, activate. Jack's wrestler versus culto-
[66.54s -> 68.54s]  You said activate!
[68.54s -> 71.84s]  Now I'm gonna have to do a comeback. Here we go. Three-
[73.72s -> 76.72s]  We need to show us how good we are at video games, okay?
[76.72s -> 78.72s]  We're not good at this game though.
[78.72s -> 81.72s]  We need to show just what we're capable of. Okay, ready?
[81.72s -> 83.02s]  Yeah. Thriller!
[83.02s -> 86.02s]  Three, two, one, action!
[89.95s -> 90.95s]  I wasn't ready.
[90.95s -> 101.54s]  Well now it's too bad because now you're caught in the combo mania. I always forget about that fucking sword move.
[101.54s -> 107.56s]  Oh, out of the corner. Into the face. Jump kick.
[107.56s -> 108.56s]  Okay.
[108.56s -> 112.56s]  I knew you were gonna do that, and you know what? I just fucking threw up blood in my mouth.
[113.56s -> 121.28s]  What is with those fucking blocky blocks?
[122.46s -> 123.46s]  What?
[123.46s -> 126.46s]  I can't talk in points. I can't-
[126.46s -> 129.46s]  What's with all these blocky blocks this guy's doing?
[136.24s -> 139.24s]  Alright, well I won that round. Good.
[141.25s -> 144.25s]  I was trying to think of what to say about blocky blocks.
[144.25s -> 149.25s]  It's just what happens when you play this game, and you try, and you try to try.
[154.75s -> 157.34s]  Shit.
[157.34s -> 162.69s]  That didn't work. That did.
[166.49s -> 170.49s]  Every time. Why won't that move work? Come on, controller.
[170.49s -> 175.44s]  No!
[175.44s -> 184.26s]  Get that out of here.
[184.26s -> 186.88s]  I want to be in the sun.
[186.88s -> 187.88s]  Get that out of here.
[187.88s -> 191.88s]  And you fucking throw the- you throw the saw blade overhead at me.
[191.88s -> 193.88s]  That's how you're gonna end this one?
[193.88s -> 195.88s]  And then it reappears on my back.
[195.88s -> 197.88s]  You're gonna try and throw me into the statue?
[197.88s -> 199.88s]  I thought about it. I was going to.
[199.88s -> 205.26s]  You didn't think I was like trying to do that?
[205.26s -> 211.21s]  Alright, we'll play online.
[211.21s -> 214.21s]  Well, we are playing online. I'm glad you noticed.
[214.21s -> 218.29s]  Jump off the face.
[218.29s -> 222.49s]  Now back it up. Back it up to the thing that I'm not gonna-
[222.49s -> 224.49s]  Oh my god.
[224.49s -> 225.49s]  What?
[225.49s -> 235.22s]  I'm just- I'm just trying to sit up.
[235.22s -> 236.22s]  What was I doing?
[236.22s -> 238.22s]  I don't know. What were you doing?
[238.22s -> 246.32s]  Every time I don't jump, and I always say to myself, why didn't you jump?
[249.03s -> 250.03s]  And this is time for a finisher.
[250.03s -> 252.34s]  You want to see my finisher?
[252.34s -> 254.34s]  I fucked it up.
[254.34s -> 256.34s]  You just pop a guy in the face.
[256.34s -> 257.90s]  I didn't finish me-
[257.90s -> 259.90s]  Smoking! That's-
[259.90s -> 261.90s]  Censor that out, smokers.
[261.90s -> 264.90s]  He's not smoking. He's eating a fucking sausage.
[264.90s -> 270.97s]  After a good fight, I just like to sit back and have some of the pork.
[270.97s -> 273.59s]  It's time for a bet.
[273.59s -> 275.59s]  We're betting, men.
[275.59s -> 279.59s]  If I win this next match, then-
[279.59s -> 280.59s]  What happens if you win?
[280.59s -> 281.59s]  If you win?
[281.59s -> 282.59s]  Stop it, man.
[282.59s -> 284.59s]  Oh, it's sniping you.
[284.59s -> 285.59s]  Yeah, I know.
[285.59s -> 287.59s]  I'm gonna win because I want to have a nap.
[287.59s -> 290.59s]  Yeah, I'm gonna win because I want to sniff for a second.
[290.59s -> 293.59s]  Oh, the snakes are on, guys. You heard it here.
[293.59s -> 297.65s]  Whoever wins, you heard the bets.
[297.65s -> 299.65s]  You hold the rules.
[299.65s -> 304.06s]  Can I please just do the knee to you?
[304.06s -> 305.06s]  Of course I got it.
[305.06s -> 307.06s]  Follow it up with the combo.
[307.06s -> 312.20s]  Follow it up. You can follow it up any time you fucking want, you know, Jax.
[312.20s -> 317.27s]  And I just wasted meter for no goddamn reason.
[317.27s -> 320.79s]  Yeah, because you're a nude.
[320.79s -> 322.79s]  And I wanted a two.
[322.79s -> 324.79s]  How do you taunt? How do you- which button taunts?
[324.79s -> 329.08s]  Watch out!
[334.06s -> 338.06s]  What did I do? I just did like the three stooges bop you on the head move.
[338.06s -> 339.06s]  How did I do that?
[339.06s -> 348.26s]  You can hide in there all you want.
[348.26s -> 356.38s]  And you're gonna- I fucked it up.
[356.38s -> 360.14s]  I fucked it up and you have full meter. I am such a good head.
[360.14s -> 363.98s]  Oh my god, wrong button.
[364.98s -> 368.60s]  How dare you throw your fucking snakes at me?
[368.60s -> 372.25s]  Get me out of that. I don't want that to kill me.
[372.25s -> 374.25s]  I wanted that to kill you so bad.
[374.25s -> 376.25s]  Dude.
[376.25s -> 378.25s]  Get out of here. I know you're gonna do it.
[380.25s -> 382.06s]  I'm fainting.
[382.06s -> 384.06s]  Oh, I've got such a headache.
[384.06s -> 386.37s]  My head hurts.
[386.37s -> 391.22s]  All right, this is it.
[391.22s -> 394.22s]  Yeah, because I used all of my meter to like give you a sunburn.
[395.22s -> 399.18s]  What am I doing? What the fuck am I doing?
[399.18s -> 400.18s]  I was sitting there blocking.
[400.18s -> 403.18s]  My brain was trying to process a word I was gonna say.
[403.18s -> 405.42s]  Fuck you a sunlight.
[405.42s -> 411.80s]  Yeah, get thrown. Get thrown again.
[411.80s -> 413.80s]  Get fucking thrown one more time.
[413.80s -> 419.30s]  I should have blocked it.
[419.30s -> 422.50s]  That would have been really good if I had blocked it.
[422.50s -> 427.37s]  No, get out of here.
[427.37s -> 429.37s]  You're gonna get stuck in this corner and I'm gonna laugh at you.
[429.37s -> 431.37s]  I'm gonna do this move and you're gonna complain about
[431.37s -> 433.37s]  why didn't I think that he was gonna-
[433.37s -> 443.54s]  I know your weakness.
[443.54s -> 444.54s]  What's my weakness? You know what?
[444.54s -> 448.00s]  I bet you don't know my weakness. I know your weakness.
[448.00s -> 449.00s]  You wanna know what your weakness is?
[449.00s -> 450.00s]  What? Do it.
[450.00s -> 452.18s]  I didn't hit the buttons right, so I can't show you.
[452.18s -> 454.18s]  I can't show you your weakness.
[454.18s -> 456.93s]  It's getting kicked in the face.
[456.93s -> 458.93s]  Good fatality.
[458.93s -> 461.55s]  I don't want to sit here and watch it.
[461.55s -> 464.75s]  They're so long.
[464.75s -> 467.75s]  Yeah, that actually, like we've seen it so many times that like-
[467.75s -> 469.75s]  Well, we've already seen it.
[469.75s -> 473.21s]  Yeah, well, this is gonna make you pretty angry.
[473.21s -> 475.21s]  This one's for all the marbles.
[475.21s -> 477.90s]  Oh, it is.
[477.90s -> 480.22s]  Every time. I get hit by-
[480.22s -> 482.22s]  I think I seriously get hit by that every single time.
[482.22s -> 483.22s]  Pretty sure.
[483.22s -> 487.41s]  Oh, you think you wanna mess with me?
[487.41s -> 490.78s]  If I had done the move right, I would have got you.
[490.78s -> 498.78s]  Try to block that one.
[498.78s -> 500.72s]  Try to block that one.
[500.72s -> 502.72s]  I'm like doing this with you right now.
[502.72s -> 503.72s]  What the fuck?
[503.72s -> 508.90s]  I knew it. I knew you were gonna do that, too.
[508.90s -> 512.27s]  You didn't account for me to do that, did you?
[512.27s -> 514.90s]  I'll get out of here. You know what I'm gonna do.
[514.90s -> 517.84s]  I was trying to jump away from it, too,
[517.84s -> 519.84s]  and I just didn't do it because I'm just bad.
[530.19s -> 532.43s]  How could you be crouching that low
[532.43s -> 534.43s]  and still kicking you in the head?
[535.43s -> 546.61s]  I need to do the jump grab to you more often.
[546.61s -> 549.38s]  Gotcha.
[549.38s -> 556.17s]  That was so dumb.
[558.41s -> 560.41s]  Have some hot soup.
[560.41s -> 562.78s]  Why did that hurt me?
[562.78s -> 563.78s]  Because I did my air grab.
[563.78s -> 565.78s]  I'm surprised it didn't just grab you.
[565.78s -> 567.78s]  You didn't even do your air grab.
[567.78s -> 570.78s]  Finally, I got it to work.
[570.78s -> 572.78s]  And you got me with your x-ray.
[572.78s -> 574.78s]  From like over the head to the point.
[574.78s -> 576.78s]  I don't think it's gonna kill me.
[576.78s -> 578.78s]  I think I still get a chance. Of course I get a chance.
[578.78s -> 580.78s]  Of course I get a chance to do your fucking weakness.
[580.78s -> 582.78s]  I know your weakness.
[582.78s -> 587.01s]  Good luck.
[587.01s -> 592.06s]  I'll see you in the fucking funny papers.
[592.06s -> 594.06s]  Yeah, I'll see you next to Garfield.
[594.06s -> 596.82s]  See you next to Garfield.
[596.82s -> 598.82s]  And Foxtrot.
[598.82s -> 600.82s]  And more soup.
[600.82s -> 602.82s]  What's another funny?
[602.82s -> 605.12s]  What are some other funnies?
[605.12s -> 607.55s]  I don't even know.
[607.55s -> 613.70s]  I'm having trouble thinking of funnies.
[613.70s -> 617.02s]  I was trying to grab you and just couldn't get it to work.
[617.02s -> 624.58s]  Shit.
[624.58s -> 632.77s]  Any day.
[632.77s -> 639.49s]  Every time. I do it every time.
[639.49s -> 646.72s]  Don't do it.
[646.72s -> 648.72s]  That game doesn't even count.
[648.72s -> 650.72s]  What was the bet for this one?
[650.72s -> 652.72s]  There was a Lamborghini on the line for this one, right?
[652.72s -> 654.72s]  I distinctly remember a Lamborghini.
