[0.31s -> 15.21s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 GAME PLAY commentary.
[15.21s -> 24.21s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Spy with the Conivers, Kunai, the Ambassador, and the STRANGE making this part up.
[24.21s -> 29.21s]  Um, the... Why the hell can I not say the name of this item? The Sapper! God, Jerma, what the hell?
[29.21s -> 34.21s]  Get eaten by the cot. Or don't get eaten by the cot. It missed ya. Bang. Headshot. Boom.
[35.21s -> 38.21s]  As you can already tell, this is a coffee commentary of Justice and Doom.
[38.21s -> 42.21s]  And what that means is I just hit record and I backstab two heavies in a row.
[42.21s -> 45.21s]  And then I just start talking about anything that could be on the screen. I don't know what's gonna be happening.
[45.21s -> 47.21s]  It could be something that is not on the screen.
[47.21s -> 53.21s]  Like, for instance, I could have you direct your attention right now to outside the current window in the room you are in right now.
[53.21s -> 58.21s]  There is a monster and he's gonna get... No, there's not really a monster out there, although there very well could be.
[58.21s -> 62.21s]  So, just for me, be careful. Just make sure there's no monster. Are you looking?
[62.21s -> 65.21s]  Okay, good. There's no monster out there. So, let's move on now. We're gonna talk about the spy.
[65.21s -> 68.21s]  I'm gonna talk about some spy tactics and some spy strategies.
[68.21s -> 75.20s]  As you can see right there, I sap that sentry and got the hell out... What? Dude, what? You shot right in the back.
[75.20s -> 80.20s]  I'm trying to do like a spy strategy and you shoot me right in my freaking back. What a real friggin' embarrassment that was.
[80.20s -> 86.38s]  Anyways, when you sap a sentry, one of the main important things you want to do is get the hell out of there.
[86.38s -> 92.38s]  If there is an opportunity for you to stab the engineer and get out, don't dilly-dally around and like look at your watch and...
[92.38s -> 96.38s]  Well, literally look at your watch, but don't metaphorically look at your watch.
[96.38s -> 101.38s]  When you sap a sentry, there was a heavy standing right next to that engineer. He actually was shooting at me.
[101.38s -> 107.38s]  Just run away. Just go away and try to get another kill because you're gonna stand around too much and you're gonna get yourself shot right in the balls.
[107.38s -> 110.38s]  Kind of like what happened to me about 15 seconds ago.
[110.38s -> 115.68s]  Another tip right here, if you have the opportunity, shoot the engineer in his face.
[115.68s -> 120.68s]  Don't wait around for the enemy to get backstabbed. Just shoot him right in his face and you know what?
[120.68s -> 123.98s]  Shoot this guy in his freaking face too.
[123.98s -> 128.98s]  I actually get a couple of good ambassador headshots in this gameplay. I think you've already seen the good ones.
[128.98s -> 133.98s]  I could be completely wrong, but let's start shoutcasting now. We do that sometimes in these coffee commentary.
[133.98s -> 137.98s]  He's getting that backstab on that heavy who was trying to get the car to be suppressed.
[137.98s -> 142.98s]  Coming around the ramp here, Jerma is gonna come up and hide because he doesn't want to be seen by the heavy, especially the guy in the top left here.
[142.98s -> 148.98s]  So he backs up. Demoman is unfortunately enough jumping into it in front of the knife and he gets backstabbed right there.
[148.98s -> 151.98s]  Going for a headshot. Maybe Jerma decides to back off there, but he gets it.
[151.98s -> 154.98s]  One headshot does not pull off the second one, unfortunately.
[154.98s -> 158.98s]  If he had only had one more second time, he probably would have had that shot.
[158.98s -> 161.98s]  Now he is being very cautious because he doesn't want to go up here by himself.
[161.98s -> 164.98s]  Wants at least two or three people to maybe distract somebody.
[164.98s -> 169.98s]  A heavy sees him, gets a couple of shots on him, but Jerma does not back down that easily, it seems.
[169.98s -> 173.98s]  He's still gonna hide here. Not sure why he's doing this. Maybe that heavy does not think he's still here.
[173.98s -> 175.98s]  Disguising himself as a pyro to try and throw the heavy off.
[175.98s -> 177.98s]  Maybe he's not gonna be in there anymore. Maybe he's gonna decide to go for this.
[177.98s -> 180.98s]  He's gonna go for the sentry gun. Engineer going back into spawn for some more metal.
[180.98s -> 182.98s]  He gets the sapper down. Medic coming out with the ubersaw.
[182.98s -> 184.98s]  He gets a couple of hits on him. Does not kill Jerma.
[184.98s -> 188.98s]  He's gonna find his way down here to hide back in the original spot.
[188.98s -> 191.98s]  It's just unbelievable. Can't believe he got away with that one, ladies and gentlemen.
[191.98s -> 195.98s]  The sapper was removed, unfortunately, and looks like he's gonna try for some crazy.
[195.98s -> 200.98s]  He gets the stab on that heavy. Oh my goodness gracious, that guy is probably rage-witting right now.
[200.98s -> 203.98s]  But let's take a break here for a moment, folks. I'm gonna talk about our sponsor for a second.
[203.98s -> 207.98s]  Crispy cream ice cream cones. Make sure you get one. They're delicious. Crispy creams.
[207.98s -> 211.98s]  Now let's get back into the action here. Jerma is gonna disguise as a heavy.
[211.98s -> 213.98s]  This is a pretty risky move, ladies and gentlemen.
[213.98s -> 216.98s]  Jerma does not understand that he moves a lot slower as a heavy.
[216.98s -> 221.16s]  But I don't think he realizes this because he's an idiot and sometimes he does not think logically.
[221.16s -> 224.16s]  But he's coming back up here trying to find his way back up top.
[224.16s -> 226.16s]  What a beautiful stab by that spycicle. And a pyro shows up.
[226.16s -> 229.16s]  But he doesn't do anything, so Jerma is gonna be fine.
[229.16s -> 232.16s]  But just in case he drops down, does not want to be in that situation.
[232.16s -> 235.16s]  Sees the knife, raise nose. This is a spy. We got spy on spy action here.
[235.16s -> 238.16s]  Goes in front of him. He gets a whirlwind stab.
[238.16s -> 240.16s]  I've never seen anything like that, folks. A whirlwind stab.
[240.16s -> 245.16s]  In all my years of casting Team Fortress 2, which is actually like 15 minutes that I've been doing this,
[245.16s -> 247.16s]  I have never seen anything like that before.
[247.16s -> 250.16s]  And he's gonna get another stab on this guy. No, he's not.
[250.16s -> 255.16s]  No, run. Just get out of there. Oh. Shoot him. Get him. Please. Oh.
[255.16s -> 260.74s]  Did I really just spend the last like half of this video doing a shellcast?
[260.74s -> 262.74s]  Is that like what just happened?
[262.74s -> 265.74s]  Am I gonna have to title this video? It's a shellcast, even though it's a coffee commentary?
[265.74s -> 267.74s]  You know what? It's gonna be coffee commentary slash.
[267.74s -> 277.66s]  Oh. My elbow. Oh, damn it.
[277.66s -> 280.84s]  Okay. Anyways, before the video is over, I'm gonna stop shellcasting now.
[280.84s -> 282.84s]  I do want to bring this up. I want to mention something.
[282.84s -> 286.84s]  If you watch American football, the Patriots just won.
[286.84s -> 289.84s]  They're going to the AFC Championship game now.
[289.84s -> 291.84s]  If you're not big into sports, neither am I.
[291.84s -> 294.84s]  But it's still pretty interesting to see that and to know that.
[294.84s -> 299.84s]  So if you guys are football fans, let me know the teams that you're rooting for that are currently, I guess, still in it.
[299.84s -> 302.84s]  With that being with the Patriots or the Atlanta Falcons or something.
[302.84s -> 306.84s]  And if you're from a different country, then you can just disregard this statement.
[306.84s -> 308.84s]  That was pretty sick right there, by the way, that stab.
[308.84s -> 311.84s]  That guy was invisible. And that guy is dead now.
[311.84s -> 314.84s]  But yeah, I just want to get your guys' opinion on the football playoffs.
[314.84s -> 316.84s]  Because it's something I'm currently watching right now.
[316.84s -> 319.08s]  And now I'm on fire. And I die right up here.
[319.08s -> 324.08s]  I remember dying from this because there was like five million pyros or like two or three or something.
[324.08s -> 326.08s]  But that's going to pretty much conclude the video.
[326.08s -> 328.08s]  We actually pull off the victory right here.
[328.08s -> 330.08s]  Thank you all so, so much for watching.
[330.08s -> 334.08s]  I really do appreciate this coffee commentary shoutcast thing.
[334.08s -> 335.08s]  Whatever you want to call it.
[335.08s -> 337.08s]  But yeah, I do really do appreciate it, guys.
[337.08s -> 338.08s]  Let me know what you think.
[338.08s -> 339.08s]  And I'll see you all next time.
[339.08s -> 342.08s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[342.08s -> 343.08s]  Coffee commentary, baby.
[343.08s -> 345.08s]  Let's drink some more like tea.
[345.08s -> 346.90s]  Is this tea? I don't know.
[346.90s -> 351.53s]  Yeah, it's tea.
