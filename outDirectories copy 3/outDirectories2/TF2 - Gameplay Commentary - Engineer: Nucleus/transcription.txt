[1.27s -> 4.95s]  What is up, everybody? It is Jerma with another gameplay commentary.
[4.95s -> 8.71s]  This time I am on Koth Nucleus as a combat engineer.
[8.71s -> 14.87s]  This first kill right here is a demo man who was trying to attack my sentry gun with his axe.
[14.87s -> 18.55s]  And he's successful a couple times, so don't laugh.
[18.55s -> 24.87s]  Like I said, this is on Nucleus as Nucleus, not Nucleus. What am I, George Bush?
[24.87s -> 30.79s]  Combat engineer on Nucleus, trying to keep this little hallway up here secure as an engineer.
[30.87s -> 34.15s]  This part is great. This medic kind of actually kills himself with an uber.
[34.15s -> 39.11s]  So he lost his uber, which is not a good thing whenever you're a medic to lose your uber.
[39.11s -> 40.87s]  He was probably raging about that.
[40.87s -> 43.59s]  My sentry gets another kill up there. I think it was the scout that was up there,
[43.59s -> 45.91s]  but I'm not really sure. There could have been one or two more people.
[46.79s -> 51.59s]  But like I said, we're on Nucleus, trying to harass the point with my pistol.
[53.72s -> 57.80s]  That's by, I just say, that engineer's life. He was holding what looked like a,
[57.80s -> 60.92s]  I think it was a full sentry is what he was building outside the spawn.
[60.92s -> 63.72s]  So that would have been bad. I felt good about that.
[64.36s -> 70.12s]  I used my revenge crit on this engineer and tried to get this medic, but I end up failing
[70.12s -> 71.40s]  pretty hard right here.
[72.20s -> 74.92s]  What's that? Oh, I fall and get hit in the face.
[74.92s -> 77.80s]  I kind of got stuck on the side and another engineer killed me with a sentry.
[79.16s -> 82.12s]  But yeah, he started off kind of good there.
[82.12s -> 84.12s]  Ruined a medic's charge, killed a couple people.
[85.72s -> 90.79s]  It's kind of back and forth this entire time with the blue team and red team.
[91.67s -> 94.15s]  I like it when it's like that. I hate when rolls happen.
[95.27s -> 99.91s]  Here's that same demo man and he actually is successful this time and he runs away.
[99.91s -> 103.99s]  And I mean, that was great. Whoever that is should be proud of himself.
[103.99s -> 106.55s]  I think I'm going to come up here and get him and like trap him up here.
[106.55s -> 108.63s]  He's going to, oh, hey, what's going on? I'm right here.
[109.27s -> 111.67s]  I do it, but he ends up killing himself on me.
[112.55s -> 116.23s]  If he had just turned around another second earlier, I probably would be dead.
[116.23s -> 117.99s]  So I'm going to take that one with a grain of salt.
[118.95s -> 121.11s]  Just trying to harass the point up here.
[121.11s -> 122.71s]  Spy saps my sentry.
[122.71s -> 125.11s]  I go, oh no, it's a mini sentry. What do I do?
[125.11s -> 126.71s]  Oh, just build another one. It doesn't matter.
[127.27s -> 131.91s]  And see this medic through the window over there and I try to trap him too.
[131.91s -> 133.99s]  He's with somebody, but I end up just killing him with a shotgun.
[133.99s -> 138.63s]  Anyways, that's the same medic that I ruined the day of before.
[138.63s -> 140.07s]  So he's probably annoyed with me.
[141.69s -> 145.29s]  I like to use the Wrangler a lot of times with the mini sentry.
[145.29s -> 150.97s]  But kill that engineer, kill that demo man and get shot in the face.
[150.97s -> 157.05s]  I like to use the Wrangler a lot with the mini sentry because it shoots so fast
[157.05s -> 159.13s]  and it just really harasses people really badly.
[159.13s -> 165.53s]  Which is one of your number one objectives as a combat engineer is to harass people.
[166.65s -> 168.57s]  Like what I'm doing with the pistol right now.
[168.57s -> 169.93s]  Not really trying to kill anybody.
[169.93s -> 171.45s]  I tried going for the point.
[171.45s -> 173.77s]  I was thinking about going for the point and that demo man
[174.49s -> 175.61s]  was not going to let me do that.
[175.61s -> 180.01s]  And rightfully so because I'm an engineer and he's a demo man.
[180.01s -> 181.13s]  So who wins that fight?
[182.79s -> 184.47s]  Run on run, one on one.
[185.19s -> 189.06s]  I get some revenge crits here and I kill people from far away right here.
[189.06s -> 191.46s]  I get two kills right here from very far away.
[191.46s -> 194.26s]  And a lot of you might be asking, German, what the hell are you doing?
[194.26s -> 198.42s]  Why are you shooting people with a shotgun from like fucking a thousand feet away?
[199.14s -> 200.90s]  And it's purely for harassment.
[200.90s -> 204.50s]  I killed this scout with the shotgun because he was attacking my sentry.
[204.50s -> 205.54s]  You don't do that shit.
[207.80s -> 208.68s]  Just trying to cap the point.
[208.68s -> 213.64s]  I get blown up by random spam rockets or random spam grenades it looks like.
[213.64s -> 218.04s]  But what I was saying before is I like to harass.
[218.04s -> 222.52s]  And when you get shot with a crit and it makes that noise that like boo!
[222.52s -> 225.08s]  It makes that noise and you know you get hit with a crit.
[225.08s -> 226.04s]  It scares you.
[226.04s -> 229.72s]  It doesn't really startle you but you know you got hit with it.
[229.72s -> 232.76s]  And you back up and you start to think, okay, this guy's got crits.
[232.76s -> 233.64s]  He's hitting me with a mono.
[233.64s -> 234.44s]  What do I do?
[234.44s -> 237.48s]  Speaking of crits, I just get hit with one right there from this pyro.
[238.20s -> 243.88s]  But it harasses people and that's one of my big philosophies as a combat engineer
[243.88s -> 246.28s]  is to just harass the shit out of people.
[246.28s -> 247.64s]  And I find that to be quite effective.
[248.76s -> 253.32s]  This scout up here was trying to spawn camp sort of with the ball.
[253.32s -> 255.00s]  I come down here to try and take him out.
[255.72s -> 257.64s]  And I'm not successful at all.
[257.64s -> 258.84s]  This medic kills him.
[258.84s -> 260.12s]  I go, oh, somebody else.
[260.12s -> 260.84s]  I'll kill him.
[260.84s -> 262.04s]  This medic kills him too.
[262.04s -> 263.16s]  I get the assists.
[263.16s -> 264.04s]  That's a good medic.
[264.04s -> 265.64s]  I put the little mini sentry down there.
[266.20s -> 269.08s]  Hoping that I can get somebody coming out of the spawn on the right side there.
[269.80s -> 271.72s]  I get in a little fight with this engineer.
[271.72s -> 275.64s]  I run out of bullets on both my guns or on the shotgun.
[276.28s -> 277.88s]  And he only has like one shot left.
[277.88s -> 282.12s]  And you know, 2020 hindsight, you look back and you go,
[282.12s -> 286.60s]  if I had just shot him with one little fucking pellet or something, he would be dead.
[287.96s -> 290.12s]  But you know, it's for null, whatever.
[290.12s -> 292.28s]  I come back down here and I actually kill him this time.
[292.92s -> 295.64s]  Uh, with a shotgun shot, I believe.
[296.36s -> 297.32s]  This time, I thought I was going to fail.
[297.32s -> 298.12s]  No, it's a pistol shot.
[298.12s -> 299.40s]  See, this time I wasn't an idiot.
[299.40s -> 300.52s]  I wasn't an idiot that time.
[301.80s -> 302.52s]  That's a spy.
[302.52s -> 303.16s]  I know it.
[303.16s -> 304.68s]  And I'm out of bullets now.
[305.40s -> 307.08s]  And it happens again.
[307.08s -> 308.84s]  I fail again pretty hard from the end.
[308.84s -> 310.44s]  That engineer killed me again that time.
[312.20s -> 313.48s]  That's why I love playing spy.
[313.48s -> 315.80s]  Because you get to see people's health and you can say,
[315.80s -> 318.52s]  you know, if I just shoot him one time in the back, he'll die.
[319.16s -> 320.84s]  It's one of my favorite things about the spy.
[320.84s -> 321.80s]  But this is engineer.
[322.36s -> 324.28s]  This is a very, very close game right now.
[324.28s -> 328.52s]  Trying to get the mini-sentry up here to harass the point and I get a couple of kills.
[329.32s -> 333.48s]  And this engineer on the other side is doing the exact same thing I was doing.
[333.48s -> 336.60s]  So props to you, Mr. Engineer.
[336.60s -> 337.56s]  I get the crits.
[337.56s -> 338.60s]  I used it a few times.
[338.60s -> 339.88s]  Kill that engineer.
[339.88s -> 341.80s]  Get rid of his mini-sentry.
[341.80s -> 343.32s]  And it looks like we got the point.
[344.28s -> 344.92s]  Same deal.
[344.92s -> 348.36s]  Just trying to put the mini-sentry in a place somewhere where it will
[348.36s -> 350.36s]  get a few shots on somebody but I get killed.
[351.56s -> 354.68s]  And it is now a very, very, very neck and neck game.
[354.68s -> 355.72s]  29, 22.
[357.72s -> 358.76s]  I love games like this.
[358.76s -> 361.48s]  I hate when we just roll or when somebody rolls us.
[362.92s -> 363.56s]  It's not fun.
[363.56s -> 365.08s]  When you just roll somebody, it's not fun.
[365.08s -> 367.48s]  Like you'll see in a video that I'm going to upload next.
[368.36s -> 369.88s]  Rolling is just stupid.
[369.88s -> 370.44s]  I hate it.
[371.64s -> 373.08s]  This part is really great.
[373.08s -> 375.72s]  I end up dying but you'll see what happens here.
[376.28s -> 380.60s]  I kill pretty much the entire team with the mini-sentry.
[380.60s -> 382.76s]  Because nobody decides to turn around and look at it.
[382.76s -> 386.52s]  And if you can see, I kill about three or four people with the mini-sentry
[386.52s -> 388.20s]  and we win because of it.
[388.20s -> 390.20s]  And if you can see it right there, it has like no health.
[391.24s -> 394.04s]  But if they had just turned around and looked, they would have seen it.
[394.84s -> 397.56s]  But anyways, thanks a lot for watching, guys.
[397.56s -> 401.16s]  I look forward to more subscribers, more views, and I love you guys.
