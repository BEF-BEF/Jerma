[0.31s -> 13.38s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.38s -> 22.38s]  Playing as the spy tonight with the Ambassador, the Stinger, or the Coniver's Kunai, and of course the Dead Ringer, my default spy setup.
[22.38s -> 27.38s]  Playing on Gold Rush tonight, defense on Gold Rush, but I don't really want to talk about the gameplay.
[27.38s -> 31.38s]  I want to talk about something that is very important to a lot of you guys,
[31.38s -> 40.38s]  and something that I get asked a lot, and this is going to be a great way for me to explain how to keep motivated in things like YouTube,
[40.38s -> 46.38s]  or really anything universally, anything you're trying to do that you're maybe not succeeding so much at,
[46.38s -> 51.38s]  or maybe you're just starting something and you really want some advice on where to go from the beginning.
[51.38s -> 55.38s]  And this is what this video is going to be about. It's going to be about goals.
[55.38s -> 59.68s]  So let me just start by saying that if you have a particular thing you want to try and do,
[59.68s -> 65.68s]  let's say you want to be a soccer player, or let's say you want to be a YouTube personality, or you want to do a commentating,
[65.68s -> 73.98s]  whatever it is you're trying to do, it's going to be quite difficult to do that thing unless you set yourself a realistic goal.
[73.98s -> 80.22s]  And this goal is constantly going to be updated on I'd say probably like a monthly basis.
[80.22s -> 84.46s]  Let me start by saying, when I started YouTube, let's just talk about YouTube commentating in general.
[84.46s -> 89.88s]  When I first started YouTube I had zero subscribers, didn't really know the direction I wanted to take the channel,
[89.88s -> 98.55s]  but I knew I wanted to do something. And I would look around at all these channels that had 20, 15, 20, 30,000 subscribers,
[98.55s -> 105.55s]  and I'd say, damn, how did they get to where they, how did they get there? How did you do that? That's ridiculous.
[105.55s -> 112.55s]  And what I didn't understand back then is all these channels that you're looking at that are really, really popular channels,
[112.55s -> 117.73s]  they all had to start from zero, and they all had to find a way to work themselves up to where they are.
[117.73s -> 124.73s]  And a lot of these guys have been doing this for a couple years, sometimes even three or four years.
[124.73s -> 129.34s]  So it can take a long time. But let me get back to the whole goals thing.
[129.34s -> 135.51s]  The reason why I bring that up is because if you don't set yourself a goal, here is one of the realistic goals that I set for myself.
[135.51s -> 144.30s]  When I first started, I said, I want to have 25 subscribers by July. I started this channel in June.
[144.30s -> 150.66s]  And I knew that if I reached that goal in July, I knew I was going to want to keep going.
[150.66s -> 157.66s]  And then I would set another goal for myself. So once I got, I think I got to like 60 subscribers in July, I was so happy.
[157.66s -> 164.90s]  I was like, wow, I put a goal for myself and I shot way past that goal. I'm going to make a new one.
[164.90s -> 170.90s]  And every month I just added another couple hundred subscribers to that goal. And it really makes you motivated.
[170.90s -> 173.90s]  It really makes you want to do it. It makes you want to keep pushing for it.
[173.90s -> 181.90s]  But you can't ever say to yourself, oh, I have 125 subscribers. Next month I want to have 4,000.
[181.90s -> 190.90s]  It's not going to work that way. Some people get lucky. Some people will get really lucky and you'll get 20,000 subscribers in two days.
[190.90s -> 195.90s]  But that happens because of circumstances that not everyone's going to see.
[195.90s -> 205.90s]  So if you are starting out as a new YouTube channel, or even like I said, if you're a new soccer player or you're a go getting into drama at your school or something like that,
[205.90s -> 210.90s]  try and set yourself a realistic goal, something that you know you can accomplish.
[210.90s -> 218.08s]  Because if you reach for the stars too early and you don't get to touch them, I like good analogy, right?
[218.08s -> 223.50s]  If you reach for the stars too early and you get shut down, it really hurts.
[223.50s -> 227.50s]  And I've been in that position before, guys. Before YouTube, I wanted to be a film director.
[227.50s -> 233.04s]  I went to college for film. I have a film degree. And I never went anywhere with it.
[233.04s -> 238.65s]  And I've reached way too high. And I think that a lot of people do the same thing.
[238.65s -> 242.65s]  They try, they reach way too high into the sky, and they get nowhere.
[242.65s -> 249.95s]  And I specifically wanted to make this video to try and answer some of the questions that people have for me in PMs when they say,
[249.95s -> 254.95s]  You know, I just started my YouTube channel. I'm just starting this, just trying to do that.
[254.95s -> 258.95s]  Where do I go from here? What do I do? I've been doing this for like a couple months.
[258.95s -> 264.95s]  I only have a couple hundred subscribers. And my only real answer to that is you just got to stick with it.
[264.95s -> 268.26s]  You got to stick with it. You've got to put a lot of effort into your channel.
[268.26s -> 274.43s]  Or even if it was something else, it all takes practice, it all takes effort, and it all takes time.
[274.43s -> 279.43s]  The most important thing that you have to remember about starting anything new
[279.43s -> 284.61s]  or even if you're already doing it, it takes a lot of time.
[284.61s -> 288.61s]  I've been doing this for just about a year now. I'm coming up on one year this summertime.
[288.61s -> 294.85s]  And I'm currently still setting goals. Every month I give myself a new goal and I try to reach it.
[294.85s -> 300.15s]  And that's what you guys should be trying to do with your stuff, your content, your anything, your flute playing.
[300.15s -> 304.15s]  It doesn't matter what it is. Set yourself some goals and go for them, man.
[304.15s -> 308.39s]  So that's going to be the end of this video, guys. Pretty good spy gameplay.
[308.39s -> 315.39s]  I just wanted to make sure I got this video out to try to help you guys with your new channels or new anything.
[315.39s -> 317.39s]  If it's something to do with school work or something like that.
[317.39s -> 322.39s]  But I will see you guys all next time and expect more of these videos where I kind of just talk to you guys.
[322.39s -> 325.39s]  I'm not going to do them all the time, but expect them every now and then.
[325.39s -> 330.81s]  So yeah, see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
