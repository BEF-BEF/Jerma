[0.31s -> 16.00s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Rayman Jungle Run, a little gem of a game.
[16.00s -> 20.00s]  Welcome to Little Gems, guys. My name is Jerma. Nice to see you, nice to meet you.
[20.00s -> 29.18s]  If you don't know what this series is, this is probably episode 5 or 6 so far, where I cover a iOS and Android capable game.
[29.18s -> 38.54s]  This week is going to be, like I said, Rayman Jungle Run, which is a free-running, parkour, Sonic the Hedgehog, Bit Trip Runner combination game.
[38.54s -> 43.54s]  And I will get into more detail, obviously, on that, so do not worry. I'm not just going to throw that out there and go,
[43.54s -> 45.54s]  yeah, that's the whole game, alright, we'll see you next time.
[45.54s -> 49.54s]  That is not going to happen, so let's get right into this here, talk about the basics.
[49.54s -> 55.54s]  This is, first of all, not a canon Rayman game. It's not canonical...canon...canon?
[55.54s -> 62.54s]  I have no idea how you say that, but this is not a canon Rayman game. It's not like Rayman 1, 2, 3, and then oh, Rayman Jungle Run.
[62.54s -> 66.54s]  This is a side game, a sort of spin-off game of the series.
[66.54s -> 72.17s]  So what do you do in this game? What do you have to do? What is the point of Rayman Jungle Run?
[72.17s -> 78.17s]  Well, according to the title of the game, you're going to be doing a whole lot of moving and shaking, mostly the first one.
[78.17s -> 82.17s]  So it's a game about running really, really fast and picking up these golden bugs.
[82.17s -> 88.34s]  There are 100 of them on each level. Trying to beat your old scores is your number one priority here.
[88.34s -> 95.34s]  There is no storyline, so you don't go from level 1 to level 2 and try to figure out some kind of murder mystery or something.
[95.34s -> 100.65s]  You're just going for high scores and for the smallest amount of time completed.
[100.65s -> 106.65s]  And just like Super Meat Boy and games like Bit Trip Runner that require a lot of memorization and repetition of levels,
[106.65s -> 110.65s]  you are going to become so addicted to this game that you have to repeat the level.
[110.65s -> 114.65s]  You want to get every single bug because it's not impossible.
[114.65s -> 119.65s]  It's incredibly challenging, a lot of levels in this game, but they are not impossible.
[119.65s -> 125.65s]  You just have to get the memorization down and the repetition down, and you will flow through these levels like butter,
[125.65s -> 128.95s]  which is quite the sight to see sometimes.
[128.95s -> 131.95s]  You will step back after a session of this game and say to yourself,
[131.95s -> 137.95s]  Oh my word, I was in a real rhythm right there. I was just flowing through these levels. That was awesome.
[137.95s -> 143.26s]  The one complaint that I have about this game, and it's a complaint that I have with other runner type games,
[143.26s -> 146.26s]  is you can really get into this thing that I call Blendovision,
[146.26s -> 151.26s]  where you kind of lose control of your mind and you just forget what you're doing and where you're going,
[151.26s -> 156.26s]  and you just end up losing because you're blending every single one of your thoughts together in the game.
[156.26s -> 161.20s]  I don't know if that makes any sense, but let me know if you understand what I'm talking about.
[161.20s -> 163.20s]  But with all that said though, you're going to get a fantastic game.
[163.20s -> 167.20s]  It's a universal app, by the way. You can get this for Android, iPhone, iPad.
[167.20s -> 169.20s]  It doesn't matter which one. The links will be in the description.
[169.20s -> 171.20s]  But you're getting a beautiful game.
[171.20s -> 174.20s]  This is probably one of the best looking games I've ever seen on the iPad,
[174.20s -> 179.20s]  and it's not because of some amazing 3D graphics engine or something like that.
[179.20s -> 182.20s]  It's the art style and how the colors just pop out at you,
[182.20s -> 187.20s]  and how it looks like every character is just created from this crazy imagination of somebody.
[187.20s -> 189.20s]  I love that so much.
[189.20s -> 191.76s]  And talking about a little bit more of the gameplay,
[191.76s -> 195.76s]  you start out just being able to jump just by tapping the screen,
[195.76s -> 198.76s]  and it evolves into being able to hand glide with your head,
[198.76s -> 203.76s]  being able to run up walls, being able to punch through walls and stuff like that.
[203.76s -> 206.76s]  And eventually, you have to put all these together.
[206.76s -> 210.76s]  You have to combine all of these abilities into the same level,
[210.76s -> 212.76s]  which makes for some very interesting gameplay,
[212.76s -> 215.76s]  knowing when and where to use your various abilities,
[215.76s -> 218.76s]  which is the real challenge of the game.
[218.76s -> 222.76s]  And I also forgot to mention this. There's nine levels in each one of these sets.
[222.76s -> 227.76s]  Jump is a set, Fly is a set, Wall Run and Punch are both sets as well,
[227.76s -> 229.76s]  and they all have nine levels.
[229.76s -> 232.76s]  There is a tenth level in each one of these sets,
[232.76s -> 237.76s]  but the only way you can unlock it is if you complete five levels in one of these sets.
[237.76s -> 241.76s]  Let's say you complete five levels in Wall Run at 100%,
[241.76s -> 244.76s]  you will unlock the tenth level, which is the hardest.
[244.76s -> 249.38s]  But final closing thoughts on this game is you're going to get a lot of content.
[250.38s -> 254.38s]  It might take you less than an hour to blow through all the levels,
[254.38s -> 259.38s]  but, but, but, but, to actually complete them all and unlock the hardest level sets,
[259.38s -> 261.38s]  it's going to take you a lot longer than that,
[261.38s -> 265.38s]  because at the end, in the Wall Run and the Punch levels, very specifically,
[265.38s -> 268.38s]  it's a lot harder to 100% those levels.
[268.38s -> 270.38s]  And even when you do 100% them,
[270.38s -> 274.38s]  you're going to want to go back and try to beat your old times as well.
[274.38s -> 277.01s]  So there's a lot to do in this game.
[277.01s -> 280.01s]  It's currently priced at $2.99.
[280.01s -> 282.01s]  I think it's a great pickup for how beautiful the game is
[282.01s -> 284.01s]  and how much fun you're going to have with it.
[284.01s -> 286.38s]  I suggest it absolutely.
[286.38s -> 288.38s]  And that is going to wrap up the video, guys,
[288.38s -> 290.38s]  so thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.
[290.38s -> 293.38s]  And go have fun with this little gem, baby.
[293.38s -> 296.38s]  I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
