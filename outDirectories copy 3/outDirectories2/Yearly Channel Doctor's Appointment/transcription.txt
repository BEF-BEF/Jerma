[0.38s -> 3.82s]  This is your new high-tech suit. Please put on the mask.
[31.54s -> 37.16s]  School is fucking fine. Why is everybody always asking about school? Like, oh, how's school? It's it's it's fine
[37.16s -> 40.54s]  Like what do you mean? I go home and do my homework and I get fucking decent grades
[40.54s -> 43.34s]  I got a pluses when I was in school, but that's besides the point
[43.62s -> 46.38s]  I've turned into your estranged family member
[46.38s -> 52.50s]  And yes, this is the three out of four videos on this main channel have been me talking about the main channel
[52.50s -> 56.02s]  So before we do anything before I talk about a single thing that I want to talk about
[56.02s -> 59.22s]  I mean, we're gonna put another video in here that we're gonna put a funny
[59.22s -> 63.34s]  I'm gonna make a funny video and it's gonna go in this video. So there's two videos in this video
[63.34s -> 68.58s]  So watch the first video first funny fucking video coming up here. You're gonna be laughing about it. I'm tired. Trust me
[76.86s -> 86.40s]  So main channel here we are where one year of just about one year anniversary for my absentee from my main channel and
[87.16s -> 91.92s]  Let's talk about it cuz yeah, you guys have a you guys do have a lot of points here
[91.96s -> 97.40s]  If you're absent from school for a year you get an F you just get an F
[97.40s -> 102.74s]  So imagine like you guys are the teachers and I'm like just stumbling in with a bunch of notebooks
[102.92s -> 106.16s]  One month before the school year is over and I'm like just wait a second
[106.16s -> 112.40s]  I can take all the tests right now and I'll pass them and you're like, okay, sure you can I'm gonna pass them
[112.40s -> 117.36s]  I'm gonna get fucking at least a d-minus on all these exams that you guys are giving me right now all your concerns
[117.44s -> 119.76s]  So concern number one main channel what happened?
[120.40s -> 126.48s]  Well, a lot of things happened there are four projects that are currently being worked on two of them are already written
[126.48s -> 131.96s]  They're the whole thing's written. We just have to secure some warehouse space and then we're gonna get shooting
[131.96s -> 134.44s]  I would have liked to have started shooting already
[134.52s -> 138.46s]  but there was a pretty significant hold up and without giving any details or
[138.74s -> 143.74s]  Saying anything is this is a couple of companies were involved. There was potential for
[144.91s -> 149.91s]  Me to get a very large production budget for one of these projects
[150.11s -> 156.98s]  And I kind of had to wait to see how that was gonna play out and it fell through so that's not
[156.98s -> 158.98s]  That's that I don't think that's happening anymore
[159.18s -> 162.74s]  But there was some potential with that was going to be the case
[163.02s -> 170.08s]  Now just like the last one got to get the team together strap on the boots pull up the pants and get to work
[170.12s -> 176.28s]  That dishes that was kind of a little at least the last couple of months was stopping our flow of quote
[176.60s -> 178.60s]  Production on at least two of these projects
[178.68s -> 185.14s]  So once we actually get going not against the idea of putting out production stills or showing some sets
[185.46s -> 186.78s]  But I got to be careful
[186.78s -> 191.50s]  I don't really want to give away projects don't want to tell you guys what's gonna happen in the videos
[191.70s -> 194.58s]  Because I like having to like the little bit of magic there
[194.58s -> 197.38s]  I like how you guys not knowing what's gonna happen or what you're gonna see
[197.54s -> 202.62s]  So doing a bunch of behind-the-scenes videos and production stills before you see a video
[203.06s -> 206.50s]  You kind of it kind of like blows it and you get to see
[206.62s -> 208.98s]  Everything kind of before you get to see it in the first place
[209.46s -> 217.26s]  And we're gonna get serious now about something that is hard to talk about and we mean about my like production
[217.54s -> 220.30s]  Friends and people we've sat down we talked about this a bunch of times
[220.46s -> 224.31s]  But I've never talked about it with you guys and it's money
[224.77s -> 230.37s]  And it's not a subject that I really love to talk about especially with viewers because
[230.89s -> 235.45s]  You guys at the very end of the day you watch the videos
[235.49s -> 237.66s]  You're never expected to
[238.14s -> 241.97s]  Give money to the videos or participate in paying for them
[241.97s -> 245.69s]  I have I've tried so long to have that not really be a reality
[245.77s -> 250.60s]  But I want to see what you guys have to say about it because we've tried like I said
[250.60s -> 252.60s]  There was a company that we've been talking to
[252.76s -> 259.74s]  For like a month or two now and it just didn't fucking happen and I can really only give so much of my own money
[260.02s -> 265.40s]  Like last time like last year the German rumble video that was like that was almost ten fucking thousand dollars in my money
[265.48s -> 271.75s]  That I and I mean that hurts that hurt that that's like that's drain in the vein a little you know what I mean
[271.91s -> 274.73s]  so I don't know like is something like a
[275.49s -> 281.47s]  Kickstarter or a patreon something that I would want to do and that's gonna take a long time for me to figure that out
[281.71s -> 288.35s]  Because I never want you guys to ever be obligated to feel obligated to have to pay money to this channel for me to make
[288.35s -> 290.79s]  Videos you should just be enjoying them
[290.79s -> 295.09s]  You should care about enjoying the videos or the content whatever you want to call it
[295.09s -> 297.05s]  And I have to worry about paying me for them
[297.05s -> 303.33s]  And it wouldn't even be paying me if I ever did it like a Kickstarter for one of these projects it would be
[304.09s -> 309.45s]  only for production stuff for buying warehouse space for buying props buying
[310.05s -> 315.05s]  Hiring a crew I would me and my producer friend the guy that produced the last video
[315.29s -> 319.38s]  We've openly stated that I don't want to take a single fucking dollar
[319.54s -> 322.25s]  There are too many things that I want to do that
[322.25s -> 326.29s]  I would love to just spend that money on than ever have to worry about anything else
[326.49s -> 330.11s]  But that did this this is all stuff that has not finalized yet
[330.55s -> 335.79s]  There's obviously I'm not I don't have there's no Kickstarter. There's no patreon page for me right now
[335.99s -> 339.51s]  It's just I'm throwing it out there because I want to feel what you guys have to say
[339.51s -> 341.79s]  I'm gonna be down in the comment section in this video
[342.51s -> 346.67s]  Reading I'm gonna take I'm gonna put my eyeglasses on and I'm gonna fucking put them down to the bridge of my nose
[346.67s -> 350.83s]  And I'm gonna read like every single comment 12 times in this video
[350.87s -> 352.87s]  So, please give me your real
[353.69s -> 358.57s]  Constructive feedback for this because it's something that I'd really take dead seriously is what you guys have to say
[358.93s -> 364.12s]  Especially in a case like this other than that the second channel is going very strong
[364.26s -> 368.70s]  There'll be a link in the description if you don't know if you're kind of out of the loop on this whole thing
[368.70s -> 372.06s]  I made a second channel where uploads are very frequent
[372.06s -> 376.94s]  There's at least a few videos there at least two videos there a week and they're all done by holy mac
[376.94s -> 379.30s]  he's doing a fantastic job editing the streams and
[380.22s -> 381.94s]  The stream is going very well, too
[381.94s -> 388.78s]  I'm having a ton of fun on twitch Tuesdays Thursdays and Fridays 7 p.m. Eastern twitch.tv slash German 985 and
[390.13s -> 393.25s]  Obviously shout outs shouting out my other channels aside
[393.65s -> 400.82s]  This video is made I wanted to make this video to make sure that you guys are aware that I haven't forgot about you
[400.94s -> 407.87s]  they this channel is my life like it's it's it's I think about it every single day and
[408.39s -> 412.71s]  Just because I've branched out to a second channel and now a live platform as well
[412.83s -> 416.54s]  This there's a lot of stuff that's going on for this channel
[416.54s -> 420.90s]  And I want to make sure it's good and I want to make sure that you guys enjoy it because if I don't
[420.98s -> 426.82s]  Deliver then what was the point of me splitting the channels in the first place and I understand that I completely understand
[427.10s -> 430.46s]  Where a lot of people are coming from actually where they say like fuck man
[430.46s -> 435.85s]  This you had a lot of subscribers on this channel, and you're just kind that you just like got in a car
[436.13s -> 440.33s]  With a bunch of fucking stuff like a suitcase, and you drove off
[440.33s -> 446.36s]  And you never came home you got you guys have been like tending to my house here like it's just an empty house now
[446.36s -> 447.28s]  I took all this furniture
[447.28s -> 451.66s]  I took all the stuff in the fridge, and you guys are just in an empty room sitting here looking around like
[452.40s -> 455.28s]  You kind of come home Jeremy the answer is yes
[455.32s -> 461.32s]  It's just gonna take time and the projects that you'll be seeing over the next time period
[462.72s -> 467.24s]  And that's how I'm gonna say you know what I mean like the projects that like the four
[467.48s -> 473.70s]  Specific projects that you guys will see over time period are stuff
[473.70s -> 477.32s]  I really hope you're gonna get you're gonna like because it's stuff that we're gonna put a ton of time into
[477.52s -> 479.28s]  I'm really gonna put effort into them
[479.28s -> 483.32s]  I'm gonna try want them to be fun and interesting and it's not saying that the other videos weren't
[483.48s -> 487.57s]  The it's not like the other videos I've ever made aren't worth anything
[487.65s -> 493.53s]  They are every video on this channel means something to me very much so so please
[493.73s -> 498.85s]  I'm gonna end the video like this just just hang on for me hang on for me
[498.85s -> 503.17s]  It is this stuff coming if I ever decide that I'm ever gonna do like
[504.70s -> 509.82s]  Kickstarter or something you will know well in advance, but it's not happening right now
[509.82s -> 513.26s]  I it's just I'm throwing it out there like I said just please let me know what you have to say about that
[513.66s -> 515.66s]  because like
[516.46s -> 518.22s]  My brain is like
[518.22s -> 523.30s]  Scrambled goat cheese when it comes to stuff like that have a great fucking rest of your day
