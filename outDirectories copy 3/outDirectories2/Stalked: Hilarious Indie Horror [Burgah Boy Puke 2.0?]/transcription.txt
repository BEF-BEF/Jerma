[0.31s -> 14.62s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Germa here with Scare Saturdays.
[14.62s -> 21.62s]  Gonna be playing Stalked tonight, and special guest, of course, you see him in the background, is Shit-Faced Burger Boy.
[21.62s -> 29.10s]  He went to a beer tasting, a beer drinking competition today. He drank like 40 beers in 10 seconds.
[29.10s -> 37.59s]  Anyways, we're playing Stalked tonight, which we are recording this after we actually played the game.
[37.59s -> 41.59s]  And I do have to say very, very explicitly, stay and watch this whole video.
[41.59s -> 45.59s]  Because it is like the most hysterical friggin' game I've ever played in my life.
[45.59s -> 47.83s]  And just the- what are you doing?
[47.83s -> 54.63s]  Hello, wake up, follow me. Stalker's here. It will kill us.
[54.63s -> 56.63s]  This is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[56.63s -> 60.58s]  Reach the elevator and get out of here. Never look at the stalker.
[60.58s -> 64.58s]  Never look at the stalker. Come on, we have to- come on, we have to get out of here.
[64.58s -> 69.58s]  Oh my god! That is the best animation I've ever seen!
[71.94s -> 73.94s]  Look at this guy's legs!
[76.94s -> 78.70s]  Wow.
[78.70s -> 80.70s]  Oh my god! That guy just died!
[80.70s -> 82.70s]  That was actually kinda scary.
[82.70s -> 86.94s]  Can I take his gun? Did I say the game was called Stalker or Stalked?
[86.94s -> 89.43s]  Because I think it's Stalked.
[89.43s -> 90.43s]  Give me your gun.
[90.43s -> 93.25s]  Come on, we have to get out of here.
[93.25s -> 95.25s]  This guy really is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[95.25s -> 98.06s]  Okay, sure, I can't pick up the shotgun.
[98.06s -> 100.82s]  Oh, sick like meat.
[100.82s -> 102.82s]  Oh, that's like a person.
[102.82s -> 104.82s]  That's like half up a torso.
[106.82s -> 108.82s]  Oh, there's another one on the left and the right.
[108.82s -> 110.82s]  I think that's like both halves.
[110.82s -> 111.82s]  Geez, that's pretty gross.
[111.82s -> 116.95s]  He said never look at the stalker, so I have to like look away from him.
[116.95s -> 118.95s]  This reminds me of like Doom.
[118.95s -> 119.95s]  There he is.
[119.95s -> 122.95s]  Yeah, this really does remind me of Doom. It like looks just like Doom.
[122.95s -> 124.95s]  It really does.
[124.95s -> 131.54s]  Can I- can I go over here?
[131.54s -> 132.54s]  What?
[132.54s -> 134.54s]  No, it's just like a dead body rotating.
[141.47s -> 148.14s]  This is like- this would be scary right now.
[148.14s -> 152.66s]  What the hell is going on?
[152.66s -> 154.66s]  It's like claymation.
[154.66s -> 157.02s]  High fighter!
[157.02s -> 166.71s]  I'm not even sure what I'm actually supposed to be doing right now.
[166.71s -> 168.71s]  Specimen.
[168.71s -> 176.06s]  You know, in all- even if like the graphics are crappy,
[176.06s -> 181.85s]  they have like half torsos hanging up.
[181.85s -> 182.85s]  I know.
[182.85s -> 184.85s]  Even if the- it kind of reminds me of like NSFW.
[184.85s -> 185.85s]  What?
[185.85s -> 186.85s]  What was that?
[186.85s -> 188.85s]  Like blood stains on the wall.
[188.85s -> 191.09s]  Did you see like that flash of that like thing?
[191.09s -> 194.09s]  I got a feeling he's gonna sprint right at me right now.
[194.09s -> 195.46s]  No, there he is.
[195.46s -> 196.46s]  Don't look at him.
[196.46s -> 197.46s]  Do not look at him.
[197.46s -> 198.46s]  That's the goal, huh?
[198.46s -> 207.65s]  The goal is do not look at the stalker.
[207.65s -> 209.65s]  Well then how did you know he was behind you?
[209.65s -> 210.82s]  You freak.
[210.82s -> 211.82s]  I didn't.
[211.82s -> 212.82s]  I just saw him.
[212.82s -> 213.82s]  You didn't see him?
[213.82s -> 214.82s]  No.
[214.82s -> 215.82s]  Oh, I can act- I can sprint.
[215.82s -> 216.82s]  I can run.
