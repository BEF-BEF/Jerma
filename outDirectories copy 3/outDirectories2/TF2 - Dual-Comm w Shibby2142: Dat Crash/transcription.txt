[3.45s -> 15.06s]  This guy has a sniper rifle pointing in the air and he's just like oh yeah what
[15.06s -> 21.16s]  is that oh yeah he's getting down I have never seen that before it's just
[21.16s -> 25.96s]  ridiculous yeah what you do is you crouch look up and you scope in yeah that's
[25.96s -> 32.06s]  what you do yeah all right I'm gonna play soldierless around what are you
[32.06s -> 37.97s]  doing actually no I'll just pocket you all right where'd you go where'd you go
[37.97s -> 46.38s]  left side so I'm going a stock rocket launcher shotgun and equalizer you're
[46.38s -> 55.07s]  going Kritzkrieg loot saga and the uber saw no I also got a request that we got
[55.07s -> 58.27s]  to try like legit battle medics where you have two medics you try to chain
[58.27s -> 63.67s]  uber oh hell yeah I've never done that before it looks very difficult it can
[63.67s -> 68.43s]  get pretty crazy because I mean you can you can end up having an uber for a full
[68.43s -> 74.08s]  two or three minutes on each side it's pretty insane all right grab that health
[74.08s -> 85.11s]  there he's just a little it's all right cap this point overheal everybody we're
[85.11s -> 93.91s]  going scout nice nice all right let me know when you want it oh oh oh oh I got
[93.91s -> 96.55s]  him I'll revenge you I'll avenge you not
[96.55s -> 103.36s]  revenge you oh god never mind I just walked right into a direct hit TF 2
[103.36s -> 112.08s]  double X Frank was not having any of that one all right double X Frank that's
[112.08s -> 123.76s]  a perfect name yeah nice good girl why would a pyro just be sitting there yeah
[123.76s -> 126.44s]  true they should be herping and derping
[126.44s -> 134.96s]  somewhere this looks like it might just be a GG right here yeah it's kind of
[134.96s -> 144.39s]  rolling through let's go take that last point slowly but surely got two medics
[144.39s -> 156.32s]  on you now oh we got a heavy I'm backing up yeah back off for a little bit I got
[156.32s -> 168.42s]  to heal this guy oh I got you oh oh watch out spy turn on guys oh man another
[168.42s -> 176.31s]  century in here somewhere oh god don't know from where damn all up top two
[176.31s -> 185.17s]  centuries up top is that medic still you guys still alive we both died or if you
[185.17s -> 188.41s]  don't I got I got a couple I got a couple soldiers in here I should be all
[188.45s -> 194.14s]  good yeah I'm gonna go second floor take up the centuries oh boy is it heavy in
[194.14s -> 198.90s]  here too oh god Gabe Newell I don't know he played with the fans of the game I
[198.90s -> 206.33s]  think his fingers would be too fat to use the keyboard he's kind of a big boy
[206.33s -> 217.56s]  oh he is very nice guy though apparently that's good when's episode 3 ever coming
[217.56s -> 222.25s]  out yeah I know you hear about the those protesters that were sitting on the
[222.81s -> 228.89s]  valve headquarters apparently there was protesters sitting on the front lawn of
[228.89s -> 233.17s]  valve like maybe like a week or two ago saying like where's episode 3 there was
[233.17s -> 236.97s]  only like three or four of them so Gabe Newell went out there and ordered him a
[236.97s -> 241.25s]  pizza so they could like eat and hang out there yeah and eventually I guess
[241.25s -> 244.93s]  somebody called the police and the police officer was a huge team fortress
[244.93s -> 251.79s]  2 fan so he like joined in on the protest nice I just thought where is
[251.79s -> 257.81s]  their headquarters located oh I think it's in Seattle no we just want to sit
[257.81s -> 266.28s]  in the rain all day oh stereotyping a city oh damn oh I got multiple this guy
[266.28s -> 270.12s]  this guy's got a Chris you're gonna get double dressed here oh oh give it to me
[270.12s -> 277.63s]  medic oh me and this medic oh god got one kill double pocket I don't think
[277.63s -> 281.11s]  I've ever had the double crits pocket that's oh man that would have been
[281.11s -> 289.28s]  pretty ridiculous yeah damn engineers with their centuries turtling up all
[289.28s -> 293.76s]  right I wanted I'm one to talk engineers like my favorite class yeah I love my
[293.76s -> 298.08s]  combat energy that's probably my second favorite class oh yeah it's just fun like
[298.08s -> 302.65s]  you just I don't know I don't know what's about it it's very satisfying I
[302.65s -> 309.01s]  will it is absolutely to work with a non-living object to complete an
[309.01s -> 316.56s]  objective of getting those wins I got like 50% where you at a second floor
[316.56s -> 324.12s]  still working on DJ set up mr. battlefield legend plans fortress yeah
[324.12s -> 328.16s]  still I'm on the second last point just healing people up over here yeah I'm
[328.16s -> 342.20s]  with Fox we're good balls can't take out that century it's so close 36 hell you
[342.20s -> 346.21s]  want me to watch change to over um probably this last point that makes
[346.21s -> 350.05s]  sense I got I got one more crits fully charged if you want it when you get out
[350.05s -> 353.89s]  you can just go to someone I'm on my way let's let's go cut down me and cut down
[353.89s -> 358.97s]  I'm gonna rip through people he's gonna cut down some people oh I think you know
[358.97s -> 365.62s]  he's a spy oh you got to be kidding me ubered yourself a nice little spy yeah
[365.62s -> 369.90s]  I just I just crits over his spy I didn't die though that's that's the good
[369.90s -> 374.31s]  part about this whole thing I'm just going suicide medic right now let's see
[374.31s -> 383.08s]  if I can kill him a little uh you know giving him a chance I got regular uber
[383.08s -> 389.49s]  we should be able to take this out on bone no I'm still we're still alive
[389.49s -> 401.78s]  somehow oh they got a heavy medic over on the near the second point second to
[401.78s -> 406.78s]  last point I got one of one two centuries down oh crap yeah Vega Bon
[406.78s -> 413.60s]  dildo with two L's laying oh no no no get me out of there get me out of it nice I
[414.08s -> 420.11s]  just got a pretty much a full uber by killing a medic with the uber saw do you
[420.11s -> 424.80s]  always go over saw nine times out of ten just because there's so many
[424.80s -> 430.62s]  opportunities to just hit somebody and get 25 free percent uber if I'm not
[430.62s -> 434.66s]  using the uber saw that I'm using the what is it called the one where you taunt
[434.66s -> 439.84s]  what's it called can't think about amputator the amputator yeah there it is
[439.84s -> 448.16s]  all right I got an uber all right I'm on the last point yeah I'm standing on the
[448.20s -> 457.14s]  second to last point right now all right behind you all right let's see if we can
[457.14s -> 462.06s]  do this do you have any suggestion which way we should go where's the century up
[462.06s -> 468.65s]  top yeah I actually don't really know fast lane that much oh god I just lost
[468.65s -> 479.04s]  you I'm sir all right let's uh all the kind sir that I'm doing it looks like
[479.04s -> 483.48s]  they got another century on point let's try to take that out at range and I
[483.48s -> 487.70s]  think this guy's got a crit screen as well so oh boy I'm all right I'm good
[487.70s -> 499.73s]  crap oh god I gotta back up back burner yeah that pyro just kind of ran in me
[499.73s -> 508.73s]  and Xbox might get this though oh bam oh they're in better factor they're in bad
[508.73s -> 516.32s]  water right now hot water oh god never mind you know what that century is in a
[516.32s -> 520.92s]  spot where you get out yeah we have to get pretty close it's right in the corner
[520.92s -> 529.92s]  yeah we're doing work me and X pocket doing work two centuries up here Jesus
[529.92s -> 535.68s]  you know maybe it'll be good and maybe you should uh switch the demo a good
[535.68s -> 546.32s]  point long almost got this all right these are two both down up here another
[546.32s -> 554.47s]  one below come on son really oh you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna switch demo we

[617.93s -> 643.17s]  mass push and get on there oh this soldier is in this top room got him nice
[643.17s -> 652.63s]  so what they have four centuries I got something I'm up there too trying to
[652.63s -> 657.56s]  spam it down wherever it is trying to look and see it looks like it's in the
[657.56s -> 666.35s]  right corner oh yeah I see it oh this he engineers aren't even there oh son it's
[666.35s -> 675.40s]  like the game crashed oh you got a game crash yeah yeah I'll protect you coming
