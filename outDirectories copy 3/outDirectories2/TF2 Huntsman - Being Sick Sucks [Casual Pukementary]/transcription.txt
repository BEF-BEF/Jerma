[0.31s -> 19.95s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jermaw here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as, I don't know, I'm really sick right now, I don't know what to do.
[19.95s -> 25.32s]  Uh, no, this is gonna be a pretty incoherent video because I am very ill right now, guys.
[25.32s -> 33.32s]  If you follow my Twitter, I made a tweet a couple days ago saying that I woke up as the sickest I've been in a long time.
[33.32s -> 38.32s]  Probably to get into my voice, probably doesn't sound that different because it's not really like a cold.
[38.32s -> 47.69s]  It's more so like insta-puke, insta-diarrhea, like I'm sorry if you happen to be eating right now and I just ruined your meal, but it is what it is, you know?
[47.69s -> 55.69s]  And I wanna make this video just to give kind of an update that I've been under the weather for a couple days and I'm trying to get better.
[55.69s -> 60.69s]  And my computer needs to be like made, like all this had to happen at the stupidest possible time.
[60.69s -> 67.86s]  And I wanted to get so much stuff done, there was a whole lot of things I wanted to do, a whole lot of videos I was planning to make that just can't be done now
[67.86s -> 70.86s]  because these last few days I've been pretty much a dead rat.
[70.86s -> 77.86s]  Like, you know when you pick up a dead rat by the tail and you're like, holy shit, this is a disgusting dead rat.
[77.86s -> 80.86s]  That's, you're holding me right now, like that's, I feel like a dead rat.
[80.86s -> 88.86s]  I was actually thinking about putting a picture on the screen of what I look like right now, but it's definitely not there because I probably watched this video back,
[88.86s -> 92.86s]  saw the picture and said, no, fuck, no, I'm not gonna put that up, that's horrible.
[92.86s -> 99.86s]  So it's probably not there, but point still stands guys, I feel like crap, I look like crap, it's just a crappy couple days.
[99.86s -> 107.30s]  I actually had to spend yesterday in the ER and not because I'm like really, really sick or something like that,
[107.30s -> 113.30s]  but because with the condition I already have, the disease I already have on top of this illness,
[113.30s -> 119.30s]  it's very hard for me to like take in fluids and stuff because it just comes right out immediately.
[119.30s -> 123.30s]  So, you know, you can put the pieces together with that if you need be.
[123.30s -> 130.30s]  But I had to get like an IV infusion of a couple different pain relievers and some saline, some fluids just because I couldn't keep anything down.
[130.30s -> 134.30s]  I couldn't keep anything in my body, which obviously is a bad thing.
[134.30s -> 136.30s]  So that's where I was yesterday.
[136.30s -> 142.30s]  Are you sure that you don't want to get an IV shoved up your ass instead of setting up your new computer you just got?
[142.30s -> 145.30s]  An IV doesn't go in your ass, guys, it goes in your arm.
[145.30s -> 146.30s]  That was a joke.
[146.30s -> 148.79s]  But it really, this whole thing got me thinking.
[148.79s -> 150.79s]  This is kind of a whole topic on its own.
[150.79s -> 152.79s]  And chime in if you guys would like to in the comments section.
[152.79s -> 153.79s]  I'd love to hear it.
[153.79s -> 154.79s]  I'm going to burp.
[154.79s -> 157.10s]  Oh, no, I'm not going to burp.
[157.10s -> 159.55s]  Hold on.
[159.55s -> 160.55s]  Okay, so we're back.
[160.55s -> 162.79s]  Welcome back to the commentary.
[162.79s -> 164.79s]  Welcome back to the pukeumentary.
[164.79s -> 166.79s]  Is that the title of this video?
[166.79s -> 168.79s]  I don't know, maybe.
[168.79s -> 171.79s]  But anyways, okay, let's get real here for a second.
[171.79s -> 178.03s]  What I want to talk about in this video or the second half of this video is how getting sick,
[178.03s -> 184.77s]  and this wasn't something I really thought of until yesterday when I was in the midst of this whole horrible thing,
[184.77s -> 192.01s]  how scary is this goddamn world we live in where there's just like viruses just floating around?
[192.01s -> 194.01s]  Like I was lying in bed the other day thinking about this.
[194.01s -> 195.01s]  It's like, this is scary shit.
[195.01s -> 202.25s]  There's just illnesses and viruses just hanging out on like a stovetop for you to grab and like put your fingers in your mouth.
[202.25s -> 204.25s]  And congratulations, you now have diarrhea.
[204.25s -> 206.49s]  That's a scary thought.
[206.49s -> 209.11s]  And I know that seems a little ridiculous.
[209.11s -> 211.11s]  Oh, I'm going to go over to my friend Harold's house.
[211.11s -> 213.11s]  This is a nice new stove you got here.
[213.11s -> 216.11s]  Let me put my fingers in my fucking mouth.
[216.11s -> 217.11s]  Like people don't do that.
[217.11s -> 218.11s]  Well, maybe some of you do.
[218.11s -> 221.11s]  Some people might be like under the age of two.
[221.11s -> 222.11s]  Babies do that.
[222.11s -> 224.11s]  Babies grab things and go put their hands in.
[224.11s -> 225.11s]  You understand, right?
[225.11s -> 232.80s]  And I didn't even think about this, but there's a huge amount of people that bite their fingernails and bite their fingers, you know, on the sides there.
[232.80s -> 233.80s]  I used to do that all the time.
[233.80s -> 235.80s]  You don't want to get diarrhea.
[235.80s -> 236.80s]  Don't do that anymore.
[236.80s -> 241.23s]  Look, the whole point of this video is you don't want diarrhea, right?
[241.23s -> 242.23s]  There's a checkbox.
[242.23s -> 243.23s]  There's two boxes.
[243.23s -> 245.23s]  One of them says diarrhea.
[245.23s -> 247.23s]  The other one says not diarrhea.
[247.23s -> 249.23s]  Which one of those boxes are you going to check?
[249.23s -> 251.66s]  I'm going to check the not diarrhea one.
[251.66s -> 260.10s]  I really don't want to wake up with like, you know, it's going to be a record for how many times I've said the word diarrhea in a video.
[261.10s -> 266.10s]  One thing before we go here, before this video wraps up, is Pedialyte, guys.
[266.10s -> 274.10s]  If you don't know what Pedialyte is, Pedialyte is this elixir, this masterful mana potion of the gods when you are sick.
[274.10s -> 282.46s]  If there's anything you take away from this video, besides me being like a complete psychopath that lasts like five straight minutes, it's to drink Pedialyte.
[282.46s -> 284.46s]  It's got a bunch of electrolytes.
[284.46s -> 285.46s]  It'll give you more energy.
[285.46s -> 289.46s]  It's got zinc to help speed up the recovery process of your illness.
[289.46s -> 290.46s]  It's just fantastic.
[290.46s -> 294.64s]  It is an absolute dream come true when you are sick.
[294.64s -> 295.64s]  It is Super Gatorade.
[295.64s -> 297.64s]  It is Ultra Powerade.
[297.64s -> 299.64s]  The one and only Pedialyte.
[299.64s -> 301.64s]  And with that, I'm going to wrap up this video, guys.
[301.64s -> 303.64s]  I'm going to get my computer squared away.
[303.64s -> 304.64s]  I'm going to get it all set up.
[304.64s -> 307.64s]  I got a lot of installation stuff to do in the next day or so.
[307.64s -> 309.64s]  Hopefully I can feel better and get that going.
[309.64s -> 312.64s]  But in the meantime, take care of yourselves.
[312.64s -> 315.64s]  I hope you guys have a great day, and I'll see you all next time.
[315.64s -> 319.26s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
