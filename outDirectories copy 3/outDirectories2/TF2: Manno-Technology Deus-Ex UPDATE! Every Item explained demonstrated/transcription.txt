[3.38s -> 13.06s]  What is going on guys, Jerma here. I'm bringing you the new Team Fortress 2
[13.06s -> 18.56s]  update, the Mano Technology update. Huge, huge deal guys. The Engineer, the Sniper
[18.56s -> 23.86s]  and the Spy all got new awesome items. Gonna talk about them in brief detail
[23.86s -> 27.22s]  right now. Gonna show you them all. It's so exciting I can hardly contain myself.
[27.22s -> 30.86s]  Let's start off with the Engineer. The new shotgun is the Widowmaker. On hit
[30.86s -> 36.30s]  damage dealt is returned as ammo. No reload necessary. Minus 60 ammo per shot
[36.34s -> 41.94s]  and it uses metal for ammo. The new pistol is the Short Circuit. On fire generates an
[41.94s -> 45.62s]  electrical field that destroys projectiles and does slight damage to
[45.62s -> 51.42s]  players. No reload necessary. No random crits. Uses metal and it takes 35 ammo.
[51.42s -> 55.98s]  Ammo is metal guys, if you're wondering that. It's the 200 ammo you
[55.98s -> 60.42s]  get. You have to use that as your actual ammo. It's a very strange mechanic but
[60.42s -> 63.78s]  we'll get into that later. The Sniper got a new sniper rifle, the
[64.42s -> 70.30s]  Machina on full charge. 15% more damage done per shot and if you have a full
[70.30s -> 74.96s]  charge it can go through people. The big downside for this weapon guys is it
[74.96s -> 80.04s]  cannot fire unless it is zoomed and it fires tracer rounds. So no more no
[80.04s -> 83.80s]  scoping with the sniper rifle if you're going to use this and people are all
[83.80s -> 89.16s]  going to know where you are because it fires the tracer rounds. On to the Spy. He
[89.16s -> 94.10s]  got a ridiculous new revolver and a new hat which is actually kind of funny. The
[94.10s -> 98.18s]  diamond back gives one guaranteed critical hit for each building
[98.18s -> 102.86s]  destroyed with your sapper attached. Minus 15% damage done and no random
[102.86s -> 107.04s]  crits. So this is kind of a reverse frontier justice for the Spy. If you
[107.04s -> 111.16s]  destroy, it works on many sentries as well, so if you destroy a sentry with
[111.16s -> 116.36s]  your sapper you are going to get one crit and it stacks too. So like I said
[116.36s -> 119.76s]  it's kind of like the frontier justice for the Spy. I'll show you all these
[119.76s -> 124.20s]  items now in detail. Me playing with them. It's super exciting. I can't wait
[124.20s -> 127.28s]  to show you guys these things. They're all ridiculous. Oh the heavy by the way
[127.28s -> 129.72s]  got a new miscellaneous item but it doesn't matter. It doesn't do anything.
[129.72s -> 134.96s]  It's just kind of there for fun. Everyone got a new hat too. New sunglasses. New
[134.96s -> 139.60s]  new hat and stuff like that. It's kind of it's for the Deus Ex human revolution.
[139.60s -> 143.16s]  That new game that's coming out for the new Deus Ex series. You can get all these
[143.16s -> 147.44s]  items if you pre-order Deus Ex. The new Deus Ex game or you can find them in
[147.44s -> 151.16s]  drops and they are craftable. But I went ahead and I bought Deus Ex because I
[151.16s -> 155.20s]  wanted Deus Ex anyways. So let's get into this guys. Here we're going to start
[155.20s -> 160.34s]  with the engineer and the new engineer items. Let's start by saying that this is
[160.34s -> 165.28s]  a very very odd mechanic. Take a look at my ammo count down there. It takes 60
[165.28s -> 169.48s]  ammo to shoot it. You do not have a clip anymore. There's no reloading. There's no
[169.48s -> 175.44s]  reload time or anything like that. It's just 60 metal to shoot that gun and it's
[175.44s -> 181.24s]  35 metal to shoot the new pistol. Very very weird mechanic because you'll find
[181.24s -> 185.04s]  that you'll have no more metal left to shoot the gun and you're kind of just
[185.04s -> 188.68s]  like oh crap now what do I do. It's gonna take a lot of getting used to but for a
[188.68s -> 193.84s]  combat engineer this will be a awesome new item. Especially the new shotgun
[193.84s -> 197.44s]  because how many times have you been able to not place a mini sentry down
[197.44s -> 201.16s]  when you wanted to because it didn't have enough ammo or metal. See look at
[201.16s -> 207.09s]  my ammo count. 113.96. You shoot you lose but you gain. It's weird. And then this
[207.09s -> 210.63s]  new item here this new pistol it electrocutes people. It's very very odd.
[210.63s -> 213.99s]  Hopefully we can figure this all out guys in the near future in the next
[213.99s -> 218.71s]  couple weeks. It works on buildings as well. So if you shoot a building I
[218.71s -> 223.03s]  believe point blank it gives you let's see here I think it's I think it's 80 to
[223.03s -> 228.39s]  85 metal per point blank shot. So I electrocute this sniper. It's kind of a
[228.39s -> 233.25s]  weird mechanic. It's it's like a Tesla coil kind of and it spreads too by the
[233.25s -> 236.73s]  way. So if you electrocute somebody and there's a bunch of people around it will
[236.73s -> 241.29s]  hit every single person around there. This also destroys projectiles. The new
[241.29s -> 246.33s]  pistol. See how I shot that building? How I did watch a see? Plus 60 plus 60. If you
[246.33s -> 249.77s]  get close enough to people it's sort of like having infinite ammo and you never
[249.77s -> 254.65s]  have to reload. But the problem here guys is you have to be a good shot. If you
[254.65s -> 258.89s]  miss all the time if you're not good with the shotgun I do not recommend you
[258.89s -> 263.33s]  try and get this item because you will just lose metal over and over again. So I
[263.41s -> 268.85s]  get a little assist with that thing. It's very weird. See 60 60 60 80 80. It's very
[268.85s -> 271.89s]  very cool. See look at see how this thing is spreading. The electrical charge is
[271.89s -> 275.21s]  spreading around. Maybe it's a new spy check mechanic. Maybe you can check for
[275.21s -> 280.13s]  spies. I'm not sure yet guys. This is the first time I've ever played with it. Just
[280.13s -> 282.97s]  want to make sure I get you guys some cool gameplay with it. You see exactly
[282.97s -> 287.22s]  how the item works. I haven't tried to destroy any projectiles with it yet with
[287.22s -> 290.34s]  the with the pistol because I hadn't I didn't really have a chance to be honest.
[290.34s -> 294.12s]  So trying to get that to work I'm assuming that it's sort of like a
[294.12s -> 299.28s]  reflect. You just click it just you just click once and that's it. Let's
[299.28s -> 303.84s]  move on to the spy. This is really really cool. You'll see here I decloak next to
[303.84s -> 307.12s]  this sentry over here. It doesn't matter. Like I said it can be a mini sentry. It
[307.12s -> 310.88s]  can be a big sentry. Backstab the engineer. Put the sapper on and look at
[310.88s -> 315.36s]  the lower right. One crit I missed but it's okay. I just wanted to show you
[315.36s -> 319.08s]  guys how it all works. I actually do something pretty cool in a minute here. I
[319.16s -> 323.36s]  get a soldier. It works on mini sentries, big sentries. Doesn't matter as long and
[323.36s -> 327.52s]  it's an assist too. It'll work on assists too. So if you assist somebody in
[327.52s -> 332.80s]  destroying a sentry by putting a sapper on it you will get the crit. It just has
[332.80s -> 337.65s]  to be on the sentry. You see this mini sentry right here. Place the sapper on.
[337.65s -> 342.17s]  Did I get the kill? I did but that pyro actually helped me and I get the crit
[342.17s -> 346.41s]  kill. That soldier hundred and two damage. It is insane guys. I can see so many
[346.41s -> 349.65s]  people using this over the ambassador. I'm going to use this over the
[349.65s -> 354.09s]  ambassador now because it stacks. If you're a good spy you can potentially
[354.09s -> 358.41s]  hold three or four crits in this thing if you kill a couple mini sentries. On to
[358.41s -> 362.69s]  the sniper now. As you saw just headshot of that heavy and you saw the tracer
[362.69s -> 368.21s]  rounds. It's a direct line coming out of your sniper rifle right to where you are.
[368.21s -> 372.30s]  As you can see, see how it's still there after I shot the demoman. It lasts for
[372.30s -> 376.02s]  about one or two seconds. Not really that big of a deal but it kind of can be when
[376.02s -> 379.14s]  you're trying to be sneaky and trying to hide. People are going to see it. It's a
[379.14s -> 383.54s]  red flag. See right there? People know exactly where I am. Get a couple
[383.54s -> 387.66s]  headshots but the big deal about this sniper rifle guys is the fact that if
[387.66s -> 394.46s]  you make the charge go up to 100% it will do 15% more damage and it will go
[394.46s -> 397.94s]  through people. Now I don't really get to utilize it. I don't really get to show
[397.94s -> 401.58s]  you it going through people but you'll see how much damage it does with a full
[401.58s -> 407.82s]  charge shot. I believe it's 518 damage for a full charge headshot which is
[407.82s -> 412.78s]  insane but you got to remember guys a fully overhealed heavy is only 450
[412.78s -> 416.82s]  health. So this weapon if you fully charge and shoot somebody in the face
[416.82s -> 420.82s]  you're gonna be doing way too much damage. Way more damage than you ever
[420.82s -> 424.70s]  needed to do in the first place. Where this weapon is going to shine is if a
[424.70s -> 429.50s]  line of people are in a corridor and you body shot somebody and it goes through
[429.50s -> 434.54s]  four people. Another downside of this weapon though guys is you cannot no
[434.54s -> 438.62s]  scope. No scoping is disabled. If you try to do it it just makes a clicking
[438.62s -> 443.48s]  sound. So this weapon is really catering to bringing back the SMG. That's in my
[443.48s -> 448.06s]  opinion because you have no other option. You have to be zoomed in when you shoot.
[448.06s -> 452.06s]  So I think that this paired up with the SMG would be a very very good
[452.06s -> 455.62s]  combination. We'll see how things play out in the next couple weeks. If they
[455.62s -> 460.09s]  nerf, if they buff some of these items I have no idea. We will find out. But guys
[460.09s -> 463.81s]  thank you so much for watching. That's pretty much all I got. I wanted to really
[463.81s -> 467.57s]  rush this out and give you guys a really really good look at all the new items.
[467.57s -> 471.21s]  Hopefully you guys got a little bit information from it. I did from doing it.
[471.21s -> 478.21s]  So take care everybody and have fun with the new update guys. See you later.
