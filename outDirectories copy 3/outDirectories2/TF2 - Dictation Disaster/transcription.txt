[0.18s -> 17.04s]  Dear Tom, new paragraph. Can you please send me the images we talked about yesterday?
[17.04s -> 30.82s]  Question mark. I would appreciate it. Period. New paragraph. Thanks, new line.
[30.82s -> 40.83s]  Germa. Tosh Meston. That's close enough. It's time to control Team Fortress 2, only by talking.
[40.83s -> 59.36s]  Walk. Walk. Left. Right. Walk. Strafe right. Back. Strafe right. Strafe right. No, left.
[59.36s -> 77.92s]  Left. Left. Straight. Walk. Walk. Left. Right. Right. Shoot. Shoot. Back. Back. Back. Shoot. Back.
[77.92s -> 93.10s]  Strafe right. Turn left. Left. Shoot. Back. Shoot. Hopefully I reload. Okay, good.
[93.10s -> 98.78s]  I'm gonna have to just stand here. I'm not gonna be able to kill any person, by the way, doing this.
[98.78s -> 111.58s]  Right. Right. Walk. Strafe left. Shoot. Shoot. Strafe left. Strafe left. God damn it.
[111.58s -> 130.12s]  Walk. Shoot. Up. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Left. Shoot. Left. Shoot.
[130.12s -> 146.28s]  Shoot. Back. Back. Up. Back. Back. Detonate.
[146.28s -> 152.52s]  I'm pretty much a bot on easy at this point. No, I'm doing worse. I'm doing worse than a bot would do on easy in this game.
[152.52s -> 157.76s]  I'm essentially the kitty cone of Team Fortress 2 right now. You wouldn't even sell me to an adult.
[157.76s -> 176.35s]  This is gonna be the one. Cloak. Walk. Stab. Right. Left. Walk. Stab. Yes! I got two people.
[176.35s -> 179.42s]  And all it took was to be a cloak and dagger in the corner.
[179.42s -> 202.64s]  Walk. Up. Fire. Fire. Back. Left. Shoot. Right. Right. Strafe left. Strafe left. God damn it. Listen to me.
[202.64s -> 208.21s]  Don't crit-screak me. Do not crit-screak me. That's a big mistake.
[208.21s -> 211.21s]  If you crit-screak me, you're gonna be real damn sad, I'll tell you that.
[211.21s -> 241.29s]  Strafe right. Left. Strafe right. Walk. Right. Walk. Fire. Left. Left. Left. Right. Fire. Up. Shoot. Right. Right. Fire. Down. Shoot.
[241.29s -> 248.74s]  God, that happened so much later. I'm gonna have to do that as if I'm shooting a Huntsman bow at somebody.
[248.74s -> 266.11s]  Shoot. Oh, come on. Shoot. Right. Right. Zoom in. Right click. Why did I- I'm forgetting my commands. Right click. Right click. Left. Shoot.
[266.11s -> 286.75s]  Fuck. Right. Left. This is a fucking da- Stop. This is really dangerous. Right. Right. Right. I'm gonna fall off. Bugs. Stop. Duh. Walk. Stop.
[286.75s -> 292.51s]  Stop. I knew it. I knew I was gonna fall. There's no way I could have made it past that.
[292.51s -> 307.04s]  Because the delay is long enough where it doesn't matter what I say. Stop. Back. Tree. Shoot. Good job. Good job. You shot the fucking stairwell.
[307.04s -> 340.67s]  Down. Oh, fuck. Walk. Stop. Fire. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. He's dead. He's already dead. Left. Left. Cloak. Walk. Stab. Got ya. I got him.
[340.67s -> 348.45s]  I'm so excited about that. Oh, yes. I got that one person. Awesome. We're about to lose the game.
[358.33s -> 367.77s]  ...to make sure you know that I tried to make a fun video. Unfortunately, comma, unfortunately, that didn't turn out so well.
[367.77s -> 378.94s]  My hypothesis and my experimentations were not happening as well as I planned. And I'm really sorry it'll never happen again, Tom. Please don't fire me. I hope we can still be best friends.
[378.94s -> 394.16s]  Your...your...thank you again. Comma. Period. New paragraph. Cherma. 900-800-500. Your favorite employee.
