[0.31s -> 15.80s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[15.80s -> 21.39s]  and tonight, gonna be playing as the Sniper in a stipulation match. Now, before I get
[21.39s -> 25.53s]  into this, I want to talk about, uh, it's summertime right now, and the pollen in the
[25.53s -> 31.21s]  air is making my voice and throat and nose all scratchy and screwy louie, so I do apologize
[31.21s -> 35.61s]  if in this video it sounds a little raspy, but hopefully this damn pollen goes away so
[35.61s -> 43.97s]  I can breathe again. Anyways, this is a stipulation match. The series where I take a certain class
[43.97s -> 48.55s]  and a certain loadout, and I have to follow a very very strict set of rules and guidelines
[48.55s -> 54.87s]  during the entire video. Now this video, playing as the Sniper, I have to use the Sniper Rifle
[54.87s -> 59.88s]  and the Jurati only. Now here's the big kicker, that doesn't sound so bad, now does it? The
[59.88s -> 65.38s]  big stipulation here is I can only no scope with this Sniper Rifle. Now this was requested
[65.38s -> 70.06s]  a very very long time ago, back when I first started the stipulation series to begin with,
[70.06s -> 74.22s]  and I've never been able to get a gameplay. It has taken me so long to get this, it is
[74.22s -> 78.34s]  very very difficult, and I suggest you try it out. If you've never tried something like
[78.34s -> 83.18s]  this before, jump into a server and just try to do this, throw the Jurati on somebody and
[83.18s -> 89.34s]  no scope, it is freaking hard. Specifically, because when you throw the Jurati on somebody
[89.34s -> 93.02s]  and you no scope them, well you know, let's start from the beginning here. When you no
[93.02s -> 98.14s]  scope somebody in general, it's only going to do about 50 damage. So when you throw the
[98.14s -> 105.04s]  Jurati on somebody, you increase that number to about 65 to 72, which really isn't that
[105.04s -> 108.84s]  big of an increase. If you look at the damage spread and the random number generation in
[108.84s -> 114.68s]  this game, it only ends up being about 20 extra damage. So it turns out, you're better
[114.68s -> 119.20s]  off not using the Jurati to begin with, if you're going to do this stipulation of course.
[119.20s -> 123.77s]  Because let's think of it like this. When you throw the Jurati, it takes about 3 seconds
[123.77s -> 128.29s]  for you to throw the Jurati, get your weapon back up ready to shoot. So after that, when
[128.29s -> 133.93s]  you shoot somebody, let's say you connect with someone, it does 68 damage. That's fantastic.
[133.93s -> 138.21s]  But in the time it takes to pull out the rifle after throwing out the Jurati, you could have
[138.21s -> 144.26s]  potentially already no scoped 2 or 3 times and done more damage than that one Jurati shot.
[144.26s -> 148.40s]  So with that out of the way, which that kind of goes over the whole process of how this
[148.40s -> 154.04s]  setup works, I told you it's very, very difficult. This is so hard to do this. I only got maybe
[154.04s -> 159.56s]  2 or 3 kills in a row before I would get killed by somebody. It's just super, super hard.
[159.56s -> 164.78s]  And I came to the conclusion, while I was doing this, I'm pretty much a gimped scout.
[164.78s -> 170.33s]  And here's my explanation for that. So I'm using a hip firing hitscan weapon. The only
[170.33s -> 175.55s]  other classes that have hitscan weapons are the Soldier, the Scout, and the Engineer.
[175.55s -> 179.75s]  Now I'm not going to really count the pistol that much, or really any of the melee items,
[179.75s -> 184.84s]  because those are technically hitscan as well. I'm just talking primary or secondary.
[184.84s -> 190.68s]  So I have a scatter gun as the sniper, except it shoots a whole lot slower, it does a hell
[190.68s -> 197.45s]  of a lot less damage, and it only shoots one pellet. And I run slower. I don't run as fast
[197.45s -> 202.05s]  as a scout either. So when you play this setup as the sniper, essentially you're just taking
[202.05s -> 206.81s]  the scout, clubbing him in the head with a bowling pin, and then letting him out of spawn
[206.81s -> 212.74s]  and saying, okay, go kill the red team. And he's like, what time is it? And it really
[212.74s -> 217.78s]  is no surprise that when you go up against any other class, really any other class, it
[217.78s -> 222.89s]  is very hard to kill them. And they are going to get you probably 80% of the time. But that
[222.89s -> 227.61s]  does not mean this is not fun, and should not be tried at least a couple of times. And
[227.61s -> 231.93s]  it took me, like I said, a while before I got this down, before I got the actual strategy
[231.93s -> 236.65s]  down. But it is really cool when you kill one or two people like that. It's very interesting,
[236.65s -> 242.06s]  makes you feel good. So here are just a couple of examples of how I got these kills that
[242.06s -> 245.70s]  you're seeing. So this soldier hits me with a rocket. I know for a fact he's coming in
[245.70s -> 249.64s]  the room. And sure enough, there he is right in his face. If I had thrown the Girardi at
[249.64s -> 254.61s]  him when he came into the room, I probably would have died. He turns that corner and
[254.61s -> 259.61s]  shoots one rocket at me. I will explode all over the walls, all over all the nice paintings
[259.61s -> 264.25s]  in that room. There are no paintings in that room, but you get the idea. I would have instantly
[264.25s -> 269.18s]  died. So killing that scout right there is a pretty good example of knowing when somebody
[269.18s -> 273.50s]  is trying to get health. Because as you saw, he was jumping all over the place trying to
[273.50s -> 278.40s]  get over me. And I was certain if I put one bullet into him, I would have killed him.
[278.40s -> 283.22s]  And those two examples, no Girardi was thrown at all. And that of course goes back to my
[283.22s -> 287.50s]  previous point of me not using the Girardi and how it's a little easier to not throw
[287.50s -> 291.96s]  the Girardi. So while this commentary comes to a close, I just want to say thank you of
[291.96s -> 296.04s]  course for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I will see you guys all next time.
[296.04s -> 300.64s]  More stipulations are in the works. I think Pyro is going to be the next one. We will
[300.64s -> 305.33s]  see. So peace guys. I'll see you all soon. And take care, everybody.
