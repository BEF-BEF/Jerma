[3.45s -> 14.68s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.68s -> 20.68s]  This time I'm gonna continue the series I started a while back called One Life, where I showcase One Life from One Class.
[20.68s -> 24.68s]  You guys know the deal. Show you something cool, show you a good kill streak.
[24.68s -> 31.86s]  As you can see on the screen, playing as the Engineer with the default Sentry Gun, the Frontier Justice and the Short Circuit.
[31.86s -> 36.86s]  And let me just tell you that I max out the Frontier Justice crits and I put them to very good use.
[36.86s -> 40.86s]  I'm pretty lucky that I was recording during this particular gameplay because sometimes I don't.
[40.86s -> 43.86s]  Sometimes I just kind of want to play for fun and I don't want to record.
[43.86s -> 48.86s]  Don't want to have to worry about the pressure of recording, but I'm glad I did because this is a great gameplay.
[48.86s -> 51.86s]  So let's get started. No more talking about nonsense. Here we go.
[51.86s -> 58.86s]  Level 3 Sentry is now built up to completion and let me just tell you quickly, this is a great spot to put a Sentry Gun on defense.
[58.86s -> 65.86s]  Only because it's the turning point of the cart and at least the first time that people come around this area here,
[65.86s -> 71.86s]  the first time they take this turn, they're not going to expect it because the point cap is right there.
[71.86s -> 75.86s]  They're thinking about capping the point. They're not thinking about turning around and having a Sentry Gun there.
[75.86s -> 78.86s]  That's a Spy. My Medic told me to turn around at the right time.
[78.86s -> 82.86s]  Thank you because that would have ended right there and this gameplay would not exist.
[82.86s -> 84.86s]  So props to good, aware Medics, huh?
[84.86s -> 88.42s]  Speaking of which, watch what happens here.
[88.42s -> 92.42s]  Sentry gets sapped and I try to go for the Spy for a second or two, but it doesn't matter.
[92.42s -> 94.42s]  That Medic gets the kill with the Ubersaw.
[94.42s -> 99.42s]  So fantastic job, Medic. You really saved my ass at least two times in this gameplay.
[99.42s -> 101.42s]  So thank you very much.
[101.42s -> 104.85s]  Putting a Teleporter up now, I don't really do anything with it.
[104.85s -> 107.85s]  I forgot when I came out of the gate to put a Teleporter up,
[107.85s -> 111.85s]  which is something I don't normally do because Engineer is my number one played class,
[111.85s -> 115.85s]  except maybe for Spy, but Engineer is my pretty much bread and butter class.
[115.85s -> 122.28s]  So me doing that, when I realized it, I said, Oh God, terrible Engineer. I don't even have a Teleporter.
[122.28s -> 126.28s]  People are going to yell at me, but it didn't even matter. We ended up crushing them anyways.
[126.28s -> 128.28s]  So just sitting here whacking the Sentry.
[128.28s -> 131.28s]  I turned the corner because there was really no action going on right now,
[131.28s -> 133.28s]  so I wanted to see where the enemy team was.
[133.28s -> 135.28s]  Turn the corner. They are coming up here pretty soon.
[135.28s -> 138.28s]  Coming back, just whacking the Sentry more and more, get another kill.
[138.28s -> 140.52s]  This is kind of what you do as an Engineer.
[140.52s -> 144.70s]  You kind of sit back and you let the enemies come to you while you play your guitar
[144.70s -> 147.70s]  and you watch your TV and you eat your TV dinners at the same time.
[147.70s -> 151.26s]  That was terrible, but watch this.
[151.26s -> 154.26s]  This is ridiculous. Look at how many Spies there were here.
[154.26s -> 157.26s]  I thought that was an eternal reward Spy on their team
[157.26s -> 161.26s]  because he backstabbed that Spy who looked like he was on our team
[161.26s -> 163.26s]  and turned into that Spy. It's just ridiculous.
[163.26s -> 166.26s]  And then there was another Spy that was just de-cloaking.
[167.26s -> 172.26s]  If you want to watch that back, I put it in slow motion so you can see it a little better and more clearly.
[172.26s -> 174.26s]  I don't think I'll ever see something like that ever again.
[174.26s -> 178.62s]  Just three Spies just stabbing each other and walking into each other at the same time.
[178.62s -> 180.62s]  So my Sentry is racking up a lot of kills.
[180.62s -> 183.62s]  Nine kills and two assists at the moment right now.
[183.62s -> 186.62s]  Me and this Medic are kind of just hanging back here alone.
[186.62s -> 190.62s]  So I told the Medic, I said, don't run out there, don't get yourself killed.
[190.62s -> 192.62s]  There's a Mini-Sentry, there's a bunch of people.
[192.62s -> 195.62s]  Because take a look over yonder, the rest of the team is back there.
[195.62s -> 199.62s]  So we're kind of down here by ourselves and finally a Pyro comes back here.
[199.62s -> 202.62s]  But look, pretty much no man's land back here.
[202.62s -> 204.62s]  And then a Demo Knight comes out of nowhere.
[204.62s -> 206.62s]  I thought he was going to kill the Medic and a Spy.
[206.62s -> 211.62s]  The Medic ubers me to save my life for like the third time in a row.
[211.62s -> 214.62s]  Coming out here just because I wanted to make something happen, try to cause some chaos.
[214.62s -> 219.62s]  The Sentry goes down unfortunately, but take a look at the lower right-hand corner.
[219.62s -> 222.62s]  29 crits, here we go.
[222.62s -> 226.62s]  Time to cause complete and total chaos.
[226.62s -> 227.62s]  She thought this was so funny.
[227.62s -> 230.62s]  This was a friend of mine, Lydia, that's the Medic by the way.
[230.62s -> 232.62s]  I was cracking up, she was cracking up.
[232.62s -> 234.62s]  It was a great time, just having fun.
[234.62s -> 235.62s]  29 crits.
[235.62s -> 239.62s]  I think the maximum is 29, I don't think you can get further than that.
[239.62s -> 244.62s]  Valve put a cap on it so you can't just sit there with like 400 crits for an entire round.
[244.62s -> 250.62s]  29's the cap, I think I only shoot 11 or 12 rounds just because I get myself killed.
[250.62s -> 256.86s]  After about 4 kills or 5 kills, I take my final shot on that Scout, but I die.
[256.86s -> 259.86s]  And that's the one life as the Engineer on Hoodoo guys.
[259.86s -> 263.86s]  Thank you so much for watching, I really appreciate everybody that views the videos.
[263.86s -> 266.86s]  Take care everybody, I'll see you all soon. See you later.
