[2.04s -> 7.02s]  Otto, Otto.
[7.02s -> 9.02s]  Can you see him?
[9.02s -> 11.02s]  You can see him?
[25.30s -> 28.30s]  He just doesn't understand the utensils part.
[28.30s -> 31.30s]  He's like, why are you using a utensil?
[32.30s -> 34.30s]  Oh, I got it.
[34.30s -> 38.30s]  It's just so funny, like, if you were to eat that with your hands...
[40.30s -> 42.30s]  Alright, so...
[42.30s -> 44.30s]  Here we go.
[50.08s -> 52.64s]  He just doesn't get it.
[52.64s -> 57.38s]  Why do you not understand utensils? Why don't we just eat them? I know, what's wrong with us?
