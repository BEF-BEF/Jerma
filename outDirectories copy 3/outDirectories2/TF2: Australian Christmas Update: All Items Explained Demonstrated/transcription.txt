[0.38s -> 5.42s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Australian Christmas Update.
[5.42s -> 10.06s]  I know I should be eating my words right now because a couple of days ago I made a video
[10.06s -> 15.02s]  complaining, talking about how we haven't seen a update or a weapon in a long time,
[15.02s -> 21.18s]  and here we go, we got like 10 new items to play with. And like in previous fashion of my other
[21.18s -> 25.90s]  update coverage, I'm going to give you every single weapon in a real gameplay situation,
[25.90s -> 29.42s]  talk about it, give you all the details, talk about what I think about the item.
[29.50s -> 36.04s]  So let's get started right now, starting with the Engineer. The first Engineer Unlockable you can
[36.04s -> 42.28s]  get is something called the Pomsen 6000, which is a shotgun replacement, does not require ammo,
[42.28s -> 48.92s]  projectiles penetrate enemy targets, projectile cannot be deflected, on hit, victim loses 10%
[48.92s -> 55.80s]  medigun charge and victim loses 20% cloak, so it's an anti-spy, anti-uber item. So if you want to
[55.80s -> 60.76s]  compare this to a different item, this is essentially just a jacked up righteous bison,
[60.76s -> 64.28s]  and I wasn't really a fan of the bison, but for some reason, I don't know why,
[64.84s -> 70.30s]  I actually like this weapon, I think it's actually very well done. Probably going to see a nerf
[70.30s -> 75.90s]  because of all the discharging, the 10% medigun charge thing, that's a little over the top,
[75.90s -> 82.09s]  but we will see what they do, I recommend you get this item ASAP. Now let's talk about the new wrench,
[82.09s -> 91.48s]  the Eureka Effect. On alt fire, teleport to spawn just like this. There is no recharge time on this
[91.48s -> 98.20s]  guys, you can do this a hundred times in a row. The downside is you cannot carry buildings anymore,
[98.20s -> 105.56s]  which is a huge downside. I guess a big upside of this weapon though is say goodbye to back capping,
[105.56s -> 111.08s]  spy capping, scout capping, if you know somebody got behind you, you can just teleport right back
[111.08s -> 116.20s]  to the first point. Also it needs to be said you do not have to go to the resupply when you teleport,
[116.20s -> 121.82s]  you just instantly get 200 metal. It's got some great novelty features, but in my opinion,
[121.82s -> 126.70s]  I'm not going to really use this item a whole lot because I really need to move buildings,
[126.70s -> 131.66s]  I'm so addicted to it now I have to do it. If you're one of those people that doesn't really care
[131.66s -> 135.98s]  about moving your buildings around, then by all means use this wrench, you will love it.
[135.98s -> 142.49s]  Moving on to the Pyro, now the Pyro got three new items, the first is the Flogistinator or the
[142.49s -> 148.10s]  Flogistinator, I'm not sure, it's one of those two. And just like the Soda Popper, when the Soda Popper
[148.10s -> 155.46s]  came out, there's a new mechanic called the Oomph Bar, which fills as you do damage. It only fills
[155.46s -> 161.30s]  if you do fire damage, this will not fill from shotgun shots, I've already tried it. So essentially
[161.30s -> 166.74s]  what's going to happen is once you fill this bar, you're going to right click to taunt,
[166.74s -> 173.86s]  and that is going to give you crits and refill all your health instantly. The major downsides of
[173.86s -> 179.70s]  course is you cannot compression blast and you cannot get random critical hits. And as you can
[179.70s -> 185.46s]  see on the screen, this weapon is ridiculous. It is incredibly powerful, if it's in the right hands,
[185.46s -> 190.82s]  you can do a lot of damage. Now a lot of people think this is going to replace the Backburner
[190.82s -> 196.74s]  as the new heavy-hitting, dominating flamethrower, and they might be true, but I think that a lot of
[196.74s -> 203.06s]  people are still going to use the Backburner because of the new secondary. That new secondary
[203.06s -> 209.38s]  is the Mann Melter 3600ZX. It is a flare gun replacement, a lot of people were curious as to
[209.38s -> 214.58s]  what the hell this thing actually was. It is a flare gun replacement, doesn't require any ammo,
[214.58s -> 220.18s]  cannot be deflected, and if you put somebody out like this, you hold down right click, you are going
[220.18s -> 225.70s]  to get one guaranteed crit shot like that. This is going to be great with weapons like the Backburner
[225.70s -> 232.10s]  because you can save that compression blast on a teammate by using this item. Now this weapon does
[232.10s -> 237.46s]  not crit under any other circumstances. If you hit somebody that's already on fire with this item,
[237.46s -> 243.14s]  it will not crit them, it's just going to do normal flare gun damage. The final item for the
[243.14s -> 249.70s]  Pyro in this update is the third degree. It is a new melee item, and this is a weird one guys.
[249.70s -> 253.14s]  This is kind of one of those gimmicky weapons that a lot of people aren't going to use,
[253.14s -> 257.14s]  because essentially what it does, see it's supposed to hit every single person that's
[257.14s -> 263.54s]  connected by medibeams, and right there I guess I hit all three people, but who really cares?
[263.54s -> 267.14s]  If you're going to get that close to somebody, you might as well Extinguisher kill them,
[267.14s -> 273.38s]  or light them on fire. The only real reason I could see why this would be useful is if you crit
[273.38s -> 279.22s]  somebody, you smash crit one of the medics, and it kills like a line of three people.
[279.22s -> 284.66s]  So moving on to the Scouty Scout got one item, gonna cover it real quickly, the Wrap Assassin.
[284.66s -> 289.70s]  It is a reskin of the Sandman, and the only difference is when you hit somebody with the
[289.70s -> 294.18s]  ball, it puts a bleed effect on them so they don't get stunned, which is kind of hard getting used
[294.18s -> 298.02s]  to, because I'm used to hitting somebody and having them boing, stand still for a couple of
[298.02s -> 304.10s]  seconds, which is a big downside, and the other big downside is this has a minus 70% damage penalty.
[304.10s -> 308.90s]  So physically going up and whacking somebody with this thing is an awful idea.
[308.90s -> 314.58s]  I guess the only real good upside is you don't get the minus health like you do on the Sandman.
[314.58s -> 318.66s]  Regardless of that though, I don't think anyone's going to make the switch to this weapon
[318.66s -> 326.25s]  anytime soon. Moving on to the Spy who got arguably the best item in this update, he got the
[326.25s -> 333.69s]  Spycicle. Backstab turns victim into ice, silent killer, no attack noise from backstabs, and the
[333.69s -> 340.01s]  big ridiculous, I'm so happy about this, this is my new default knife, you are immune to fire damage
[340.01s -> 345.93s]  for the first couple seconds, but it destroys the knife in the process. So if you get lit on fire,
[345.93s -> 351.45s]  I'll show you here in a minute, you do not light on fire and you do not take any damage, so it is
[351.45s -> 357.05s]  huge. Not to mention backstabbing people and having them turn into these stone ice sculptures,
[357.05s -> 362.41s]  it's so awesome. That is a downside though, because that reveals your position, people are going to
[362.41s -> 366.97s]  know there's a Spy around. If you turn around and see two ice sculptures or your two best friends,
[366.97s -> 372.10s]  you're going to start looking around. So here is another example of how the fireproof mechanism
[372.10s -> 376.50s]  works. I'm going to be up here, a Pyro is going to come outside, spray me, I'm not going to light
[376.50s -> 383.14s]  on fire. See right there, I should have lit on fire, but I didn't. My knife got destroyed instead,
[383.14s -> 388.66s]  and it takes 15 seconds for it to come back. After 15 seconds, I can go back to what I was doing
[388.66s -> 396.65s]  before. The final item in this update is something called the Holiday Punch. It is a new heavy melee
[396.65s -> 402.41s]  unlockable, and I left it for last because it really is just ridiculous. It's just the stupidest
[402.41s -> 408.44s]  item I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of fun. So basically the mechanic is,
[409.00s -> 413.64s]  when you crit somebody with these gloves on, it's going to force them to do the laugh taunt.
[413.64s -> 417.88s]  And right here, here's a funny example of how it can actually be useful. See, I crit that guy,
[417.88s -> 423.13s]  hit him from behind, it's just, I can't even begin to explain this item. Anytime you hit somebody from
[423.13s -> 428.81s]  behind, they're going to start laughing, or any time you crit them. And crits don't do any damage.
[428.81s -> 433.70s]  If you crit somebody, it won't hurt them at all, they just start laughing at you. It is like just,
[433.70s -> 439.14s]  I can't, I am at a loss, but it is a lot of fun to mess around with. And if somebody else is wearing
[439.14s -> 443.70s]  these gloves, and you punch them, it doesn't matter if they're in front of you, behind you,
[443.70s -> 448.82s]  next to you, if you just touch them with these gloves on, they will do a laugh taunt at you.
[449.53s -> 454.17s]  That is going to conclude the video, but before I leave, I need to say this.
[454.89s -> 462.50s]  You can only get the Spy Knife, the Heavy Gloves, and the Scout Wrapping Paper. You can only get
[462.50s -> 469.38s]  them in nice crates, or by using slot tokens to craft. That is the only way you can get those
[469.38s -> 474.36s]  items. You can't buy them, and they don't drop. That potentially could change in the next couple
[474.36s -> 479.00s]  of days, or even the next couple of weeks. It definitely will change, but as of right now,
[479.00s -> 483.94s]  you can only get them through those means. So thanks everybody, hope you guys enjoyed,
[483.94s -> 488.02s]  happy holidays again, and I'll see you guys next time. Take care everybody.
