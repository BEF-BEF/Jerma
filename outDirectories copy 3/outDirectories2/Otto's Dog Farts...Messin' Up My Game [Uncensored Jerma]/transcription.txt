[0.31s -> 19.88s]  An ally has been... Oh my god. Oh my dog just farted. Oh, this sucks. It's horrible, dude. I can't...
[19.88s -> 27.88s]  You're shitting me right now. I can't even, like, play the game. Be careful, they're right here. I can't even... I can't get...
[27.88s -> 32.88s]  Smite's one of those games where you can't leave. I can't leave right now. I have to, like, accept this for what happened.
[32.88s -> 37.31s]  It's not like I can just get up and, like, walk away right now.
[38.31s -> 49.90s]  Seriously? Man, this is horrendous. Oh god, hold on. No, I'm serious right now. Hold on a second. I'm wicked sorry.
[49.90s -> 61.57s]  Oh my god. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Here I come. Oh, you guys don't even need my help, do you?
[61.57s -> 67.06s]  My ult didn't even go off. I got him. Oh, I'm sorry. Seriously? Alright.
[67.06s -> 76.06s]  Alright, go on. Shoo. Dude, can you imagine if, like, I just, like, if you guys both died right there?
[76.06s -> 84.37s]  Oh, dragon, dragon. What? Yeah, that was weird. I saw that. No, that was miles away, but I, like, got hit instantly.
[84.37s -> 92.37s]  What? He's going down. He's gonna die. I don't believe it. Oh, he's gonna die, don't worry. Don't you worry nothing.
[92.37s -> 101.82s]  Don't you worry nothing. This dragon is toast. No, you're toast. No, I just saw him. You're dead. You are dead.
[102.82s -> 115.49s]  Fucking dog. Oh, god damn it. If this dog didn't, like, fart in my face, like, that would not have happened.
[115.49s -> 121.10s]  He didn't, like, poop. No, he didn't. He's right here. Have you, like, checked the floor?
[121.10s -> 135.13s]  No, there's no, like, ugh. That, like, completely threw my game off. We were doing, like, oh, actually, we killed him, but I was doing, like, well, and then the dog farted in my face, and it was just over.
