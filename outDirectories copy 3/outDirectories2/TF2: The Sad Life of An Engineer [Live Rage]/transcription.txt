[1.85s -> 21.10s]  Hi, sir. Yeah. Spies? You are so scary. Yeah, I- get- no, no! You punk! God damn it, you-
[21.10s -> 31.98s]  God, every word in the dictionary to describe hatred and pissed-offness. Let's move this up.
[31.98s -> 34.94s]  This is where we can start to do a lot of damage, right? God damn it!
[40.66s -> 58.22s]  Put the exit right over here. It's not that far from spawn, but it's okay. It's not that far from
[58.22s -> 64.15s]  spawn. This teleporter is, like, as far as you can throw a baseball from spawn. Like, oh, let me just,
[64.15s -> 72.79s]  like, toss a baseball, like, underhand. Underhanded. This is an underhand softball. You headless bastard.
[72.79s -> 86.70s]  Get out of here. What? What? What? What? How did this happen? I gotta watch that back. What the- what
[86.70s -> 101.85s]  the hell just happened? This thing blew up for no reason. I'm so paranoid right now. I- it- am I
[101.85s -> 106.41s]  going absolutely crazy right now, or is there, like, a ghost on Bon Blitz that is killing
[106.41s -> 125.59s]  my teleporter over and over again? No! No! No! No! No! Thank the old gods, the new gods,
[125.59s -> 132.33s]  and the gods of old and new, and the- you- get the hell- no, it's okay. It's just a regular bald-ass
[132.33s -> 142.22s]  pyro. Anytime I see, like, a bald-ass pyro, I just automatically think spy. Just, like, a default
[142.22s -> 147.18s]  bald pyro just running at you. Just, hey, hi, I'm not a spy. Don't worry, I'm not a spie.
[159.59s -> 167.50s]  No! God, did you see that crit rocket? Holy di- no! Where is he? Where is this guy?
[169.74s -> 179.27s]  That just- son of a- ah! No, are you real? He's- it's the pyro back there. What- what I tell you,
[179.51s -> 187.30s]  what I tell you, the bald-ass pyro running around up here is a spy. Watch this. That's him right
[187.30s -> 199.38s]  there. Yeah. Could- could you guess? Can I please just get this set up and not have to, like, worry
[199.38s -> 208.02s]  about this anymore? Okay, I gotta go on- on the guys of Nightfall. Here we go. I got- there has
[208.02s -> 217.45s]  to be, like- dude, I don't even know which one it is. This has gotta get in here. Hurry. Hurry up.
[217.45s -> 223.00s]  Hurry up. Hurry up and build. Hurry up and build. Hurry up and build. You stupid son of a bitch! I
[223.00s -> 228.97s]  hate you. All right, I don't hate you. I did hate you for, like, a good five seconds right there,
[228.97s -> 240.34s]  but I don't hate you right now. Maybe I hate myself for doing that. See, when there's a spy on the
[240.34s -> 246.20s]  other team, or, like, multiple spies on the other team, that are just making your day just a living
[246.20s -> 252.09s]  hell. Like, seriously, playing Engineer is, like, the scariest class to play in this game, especially
[252.09s -> 260.22s]  when there's, like, a friggin' unusual spy with, like, 20 billion kills on his knife running around
[260.22s -> 267.75s]  trying to get, like, free kills on you. Ain't gonna happen. You ain't gonna get me. You ain't
[267.75s -> 281.05s]  gonna stab me. I promise you that. You shut up. Oh my god, what am I doing? I fall off cliff
[281.05s -> 294.87s]  cuz I'm an idiot. Let's just keep a base out here. Get a teleporter built. Holy hell. I swear. Where
[294.87s -> 303.02s]  is he? You fucking piece of- Stop playing the Giles theme music right now, guys, because this- it's on
[303.02s -> 318.60s]  now. Hi, sniper. Get the- Yeah, where you going? You going down here with your dead ringer? Oh, I
[318.60s -> 327.35s]  heard you. Where are you? Where'd you go? I heard it. You all heard it. Not gonna let him get away
[327.35s -> 339.61s]  with that. Yeah, get the- Yeah, what's up, bro? How you doing? Oh, you're the real one. I'm hiding
[339.61s -> 352.06s]  this in the bushes. The sentry bush made from the- I just ruined my desk. Um, this is- Oh, look at
[352.06s -> 364.15s]  the ad. I found the Spycicle. Can you believe it? It's my personal mission now to kill that spy.
[364.15s -> 369.24s]  Oh, look. Look who's up there. Now he doesn't have his dead ringer. I want- No, the soldier,
[369.24s -> 375.53s]  let me get this kill. Let me hit him. He doesn't have a dead ringer right now. It's my kill,
[375.53s -> 384.89s]  not yours. It's my kill, not yours. You leave me the fuck alone, okay?
[388.86s -> 394.46s]  Oh, I keep falling off of this cliff and it's gonna make me mad. It's gonna drive me friggin'
[394.46s -> 403.96s]  mental. Once I get this teleporter up, if I don't get trolled by spies for the remainder of the game,
[403.96s -> 414.41s]  then we should be okay. Just gotta get it up. Keep having to use my metal on things I don't
[414.41s -> 452.02s]  want to use the metal on. Screw you! Teleporter up. At least all my stuff is up. You can go ahead
[452.02s -> 457.86s]  and like shoot from across the map and be a prick. That's fine. I don't even care. All I want is to
[457.86s -> 465.59s]  get this teleporter up. Who is attacking this teleporter? Who is doing this? Somebody help me.
[467.99s -> 480.02s]  I- This is not gonna work. It's over. Good. Game. Good. Game. At least I got that.
[480.02s -> 484.62s]  At least I got that last laugh right there. Oh, look who it is. Oh, look who it is.
