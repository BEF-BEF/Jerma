[4.34s -> 34.26s]  I'm getting my ass kicked. This guy's beating the shit out of me.
[35.26s -> 38.26s]  How you gonna learn if you keep getting hit in the head all the time?
[49.16s -> 58.30s]  Dude, this is what happens when you drink like a shitload of vodka and you get in a fight with somebody.
[59.30s -> 64.30s]  I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. See this hand up here? You see this hand? Yeah, you just got clubbed.
[65.30s -> 69.30s]  You just got fucking clubbed by this shit-faced vodka salesman. You wanna fucking go?
[70.30s -> 79.59s]  You like this one? You like this technique? You like this technique? You like this one?
[80.59s -> 84.77s]  You know what I got for you? You like this? What do you got? You wanna go fucking with me?
[85.77s -> 88.77s]  What's that? Tell your mother. Tell your father. You ain't got nothing on me.
[89.77s -> 92.77s]  You motherfucker. I'll take you down. One more punch. Up a cut.
[93.77s -> 100.95s]  What the fuck? Go down. Will this guy seriously go down? Look at his health. This is bullshit. This is bullshit.
[101.95s -> 105.71s]  Look at this guy's health. Will you seriously go down?
[108.62s -> 115.93s]  I got one for you. I've got a punch for you right here.
[120.93s -> 122.93s]  You wanna go? I've got you.
[125.93s -> 129.34s]  Fuck you. I just took your ass out.
[132.06s -> 135.06s]  Keep your damn feet in place. You'll break the game if you keep running around.
[136.06s -> 142.06s]  Any other body part you wanna move is okay. But not your feet. Not unless I tell you. You got that?
[143.49s -> 145.49s]  It's all about the blocking. You gotta stay true.
[146.49s -> 150.73s]  Give him a couple of gut punches. Here we go. Looking good. Looking good.
[151.97s -> 161.25s]  I didn't do any damage to him right there. What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that?
[161.25s -> 167.88s]  No, really? What? Why did he just do the shimmy in front of me? Is that his taunt?
[168.88s -> 177.18s]  How am I supposed to beat this guy? This is the second round. I'm like trying to move.
[178.18s -> 181.35s]  I guess I can like duck around a little bit but it doesn't matter.
[184.45s -> 186.45s]  I gotta think of some like secret technique. I gotta do something about this.
[187.45s -> 195.64s]  Here we go. Give him the wrist punch. He can't handle it. He can't take it.
[198.35s -> 202.35s]  This guy's having a lot of trouble with my like pat on the back you did a good job at graduation son move.
[202.35s -> 207.72s]  He can't do it. He can't handle it. Yeah, he can. No, no. It actually might be working a little bit.
[208.72s -> 213.72s]  Then I gotta change this into something else. Here we go. We're gonna change this into a punch in the face.
[214.72s -> 222.19s]  Like that. Damn it, it didn't work. Get over here. I gotta rethink my strategy.
[224.26s -> 229.94s]  I gotta rethink my strategy. We're going double punches. I'm gonna go two haymakers in his face.
[233.86s -> 237.49s]  God damn it. Can I please just fucking hit this guy?
[241.30s -> 245.61s]  And if you crouch down, you get a good angle for hitting the body.
[246.61s -> 255.85s]  Hey, you want some free hits? Come on. Is that all you got? You piece of shit. Is that all you got? I'm the man.
[256.85s -> 263.24s]  Do you know who I am? Look at me flex. Yeah. That's working.
[264.24s -> 275.59s]  We're doing good. We just gotta keep this going. Just pretend like you're in a marching band.
[275.59s -> 280.79s]  Go forward and back. I'm not even gonna attempt to do anything else. I'm gonna just do this.
[281.79s -> 289.79s]  I'm just gonna like wash his face. What a terrible fight.
[291.16s -> 295.16s]  Imagine if you were some of these guys that came here and paid for this fight and you saw this dumbass.
[296.16s -> 302.86s]  You'd be very disappointed. In fact, I would expect for this guy to get like beat up in the parking lot after this.
[303.86s -> 310.48s]  You maybe paid 20 bucks. I bet 20 bucks on you and you did like the dancing marching band move. You're a fucking idiot.
[310.48s -> 316.74s]  You know what? We gotta do some more. There we go. Right in the chin. Gotta get him right in his chin.
[317.74s -> 325.34s]  I gotta swing that up right in his chin. Quick ones. Quick ones. Quick ones.
[326.90s -> 330.90s]  Just fucking hammer his head. God damn it.
[331.90s -> 338.65s]  You don't fuck this. Now I'm fucking pissed off. You thought you were gonna fucking beat me in this fucking game?
[339.65s -> 345.65s]  Now you got me fucking angry. Because I've been trying to fight this same fucking guy for the last like 10 straight minutes
[345.65s -> 349.65s]  and I cannot beat him and I'm fucking gonna win no matter what.
[350.65s -> 361.23s]  I'm gonna fucking die. No. Don't lose. I don't want to do this again. Use all your power. Use everything.
[364.23s -> 365.23s]  No.
[367.37s -> 372.54s]  If you mess up, get back in the guard post and press the circle button. Quick.
[375.70s -> 381.40s]  I'm gonna give him the ear punches. This is actually working. This is working.
[382.96s -> 391.30s]  This shit's gonna work. Come here. Just pretend like you're dragging a brick across his face. That's all you gotta do.
[392.73s -> 400.22s]  Just strangle him with the piano wire. Take him out Hitman style. I'll fucking strangle you.
[404.98s -> 411.70s]  What the fuck am I doing dude? What?
