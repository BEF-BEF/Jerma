[1.72s -> 10.62s]  Be very careful here. Be very, very careful here. Be very careful here.
[29.50s -> 38.44s]  There he is. Okay, if I don't get this guy right now, then I don't know. Zoom in. Dude,
[38.44s -> 44.52s]  the other team's over there. Scope in. Scope in, dude. Scope in. What are you, what are you doing?
[44.52s -> 50.31s]  What are you checking for? Landmines? Let's go. Does nobody know I'm standing right here?
[63.74s -> 71.85s]  Hi. Oh, this is so much fun, dude. This item is so much fun. Forget about the mini crits,
[71.85s -> 76.81s]  man. This thing is just a blast. Just jumping around is like the funnest damn thing ever.
[76.81s -> 81.30s]  This is so much fun. Watch this, this sniper right here. I think this is my, yeah, there's a sniper
[81.30s -> 94.82s]  right here. Wow, here comes a pyro. Where'd he go? What? Oh, he's got this too. We, this
[94.82s -> 108.10s]  two bird scouts. All right, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling the double bird scout. Um, Sir, I just
[108.10s -> 116.60s]  shot you like three times. Sir, I'm standing in front of you. Sir. Sir. Excuse me, sir.
[122.90s -> 129.58s]  See that roost up there? You see this roost? I'm going to roast their turkeys in a second.
[130.38s -> 134.54s]  You're going to get your fucking turkeys roasted, snipers. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[135.42s -> 142.52s]  Thought I had more ammo. I thought I had more ammo. You want to get your turkey roasted? Open
[142.52s -> 146.28s]  the door. You want to get your turkey roasted? Go ahead and open the door.
[150.86s -> 157.54s]  Roasted turkey, oven roasted with some ham and some onion. What about this guy? You want to get
[157.54s -> 166.98s]  your fucking turkey roasted. Are they still up there? Oh yeah, they are. Oh, you better believe
[166.98s -> 175.69s]  it. Please don't shoot me in the face already. Make sure I equip the nice bird jump. Is anybody
[175.69s -> 187.77s]  up there? Whoa. See you. See you later. No, come on. Get up there. That's so dumb.
[191.48s -> 195.64s]  I'm out of here. See, I left. I'm not here. You don't have to worry about a thing. I'm not here.
[196.36s -> 202.23s]  All right. I'm not here. See, I'm gone. See, I'm gone. I'm gone. Don't even worry about it.
[202.23s -> 209.16s]  It's, there's no reason to be that concerned about this. Just walk into just my God. Can I
[209.16s -> 216.04s]  please get this? Is it not going to even happen? I'm swear to God, dude, please just walk in.
[216.04s -> 227.64s]  Don't, please. Earthquake. Don't mind me. I'm just going to chill out right here.
[227.64s -> 232.60s]  I'm going to get seen. There's no way no one's going to see me do this. Some soldier is going
[232.60s -> 245.11s]  to turn the corner. Wait, I spy in the window. I think he's AFK. Oh my fucking God. Oh my God.
[246.87s -> 254.52s]  Oh, that only, only two. I don't have any words for that. I don't have words for that. I just
[254.52s -> 266.98s]  got so destroyed right there. That was horrible. I'm on his head. He didn't even know. He doesn't
[266.98s -> 277.30s]  know. He didn't even know. He didn't even know. Give me that health pack. Can I have that health
[277.30s -> 284.31s]  pack please? You want to jump scare me medic? Is that what you want to do? You want to jump
[284.31s -> 290.79s]  scare me? Huh? I ain't going to get jump scared twice. That's a spy. You want to go? You want to
[290.87s -> 298.26s]  activate the bird scout? Come on. Bird scout. Ooh, see you later. You think you're going to get away.
[298.90s -> 312.63s]  You can never defeat the bird scout. Come on dudes. Where's the? Oh, hello. Oh, hello.
[321.08s -> 329.80s]  The confusion. Confusion sets in. I actually get a kill, but that's not what I wanted.
[329.80s -> 334.30s]  God, that's going to be such a pain in the ass to deal with. A scout jumping around all of you
[334.30s -> 339.82s]  is annoying. A scout jumping around all around you 20, 30 feet in the air has got to be even
[339.82s -> 345.48s]  more annoying. There's a lot of people stuffed in that room. Here we go. This is what I want to do.
[349.46s -> 358.62s]  I can't. Hi everybody. How are you? What? You. How did he hit me with a melee?
[358.62s -> 368.55s]  That didn't make any sense. I was like 40 feet above everybody. Holy hell. What the hell was that?
[369.27s -> 373.45s]  Oh, watch this. This heavy, this heavy, this heavy. Here we go. What? What's going on?
[383.13s -> 387.02s]  What happened? What just happened?
