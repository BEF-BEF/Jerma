[0.31s -> 13.76s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.76s -> 19.76s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Sniper with the... no, no, that was... I almost said the Machina.
[19.76s -> 25.76s]  With the Heatmaker, the... Darwin's Danger Shield? I god damn it, I just don't remember.
[25.76s -> 29.76s]  I think... I actually think it's the Razorback because there are a lot of spies on the other team.
[29.76s -> 31.76s]  And the Tribalman Shiv.
[31.76s -> 38.94s]  So this video, we're gonna talk about... I started this sort of little mini-series a while ago, and I never really followed up on it.
[38.94s -> 43.94s]  So today, we're gonna follow up on it. It is, what would I add into Team Fortress 2?
[43.94s -> 47.94s]  And we're gonna be covering the Sniper today, because I'm playing as the Sniper.
[47.94s -> 52.94s]  And of course, I wanna get your guys' opinions on all this stuff. Last time, when I talked about the Engineer,
[52.94s -> 56.94s]  we had a really, really good discussion going in the comments section, so do that again.
[56.94s -> 60.94s]  Whatever you'd like to see added for the Sniper, or what you think would be cool for the Sniper.
[60.94s -> 66.94s]  Whether it's a melee secondary or a new primary, please put it in the comments section. Let's keep that going.
[66.94s -> 72.94s]  So, talking about the Sniper, of course, he has his primary, which is the Sniper Rifle.
[72.94s -> 78.94s]  And they didn't really deviate that much, except for the Huntsman. The Huntsman is a huge deviation from his typical primary.
[78.94s -> 81.94s]  And that's kind of where I wanna go here.
[81.94s -> 87.94s]  And it's something that a lot of people have actually talked about, and I think there is a Steam Workshop item of this.
[87.94s -> 92.94s]  And I think it is an incredible idea, and they really should think about implementing this.
[92.94s -> 97.94s]  It is a Boomerang primary. Not a secondary, a Boomerang primary.
[97.94s -> 105.37s]  And after sitting here for about 45 minutes or so, just thinking about it and talking about what I'm gonna do with this commentary to myself,
[105.37s -> 108.37s]  I've come up with this. And let me know what you guys think about this.
[108.37s -> 113.37s]  I'm not sure if this is 100% the best thing that could possibly be for this item, but it's what I think would be cool.
[113.37s -> 119.37s]  So, you cock it back. Let's say you have it in your left hand. You come out of spawn, and there's a Demoman 50 yards in front of you on the enemy team.
[119.37s -> 122.37s]  You cock it back, and there's a bar in the lower right that fills up.
[122.37s -> 129.61s]  Once that thing's filled up, it's gonna go max distance, and maybe it would mini-crit if you filled that bar up all the way.
[129.61s -> 135.61s]  And the bar wouldn't be just one second. I would think it would be something around two or three full seconds before you got a mini-crit.
[135.61s -> 140.61s]  Therefore, making it not just an easy weapon, just a bang, bang, bang, just get mini-crits over and over again with this thing.
[141.61s -> 145.61s]  So picture this. A Demoman is coming at you, and he's spamming his stickies at you.
[145.61s -> 150.61s]  He's shooting his grenade launcher at you. You fall back, you're charging this thing up, you whip around, you throw it,
[150.61s -> 155.61s]  and maybe you're taking it off to the side a little bit to try and compensate for the curve that would be happening.
[155.61s -> 163.61s]  Because how I picture this is the weapon comes out straight, and then kind of takes a curve and swings over to the right-hand side,
[163.61s -> 166.61s]  making skill shots available for you to do.
[166.61s -> 174.10s]  And to keep discussing this skill shot idea, maybe instead of, throw away the mini-crit idea I just came up with,
[174.10s -> 177.10s]  what if instead of holding the button down gave you crits?
[177.10s -> 185.10s]  Think of that bar filling up, that's the arc. The more you hold it down, the more insane arc you are going to get,
[185.10s -> 189.10s]  and maybe it could go through people rather than just hitting one.
[189.10s -> 193.47s]  And TF2 really does need more stuff like this in the game.
[193.47s -> 198.47s]  I know they're harder to balance because if you have five rocket launchers with a soldier,
[198.47s -> 204.47s]  and then you come up with a soldier rifle, you're redesigning the whole class from the ground up, essentially.
[204.47s -> 209.47s]  But they are so cool, and it gives a much more variety-based gameplay.
[209.47s -> 212.47s]  You can make a bunch of different combinations rather than having,
[212.47s -> 220.47s]  oh, I'm going to use this sniper rifle and the Jirardi, or this sniper rifle and the Jirardi, or this sniper rifle and the Jirardi.
[221.47s -> 227.78s]  You have a lot of different options. When you come up with different core class mechanics that get changed,
[227.78s -> 229.78s]  you can go nuts, you can have so many different options.
[229.78s -> 233.78s]  I think I would love to see more stuff like this involved in Team Fortress 2,
[233.78s -> 238.78s]  because I think it would breathe a lot more air up the butt of TF2.
[238.78s -> 245.78s]  That's a really bad way to say that, but it would breathe more air and breathe life into this game again.
[245.78s -> 252.27s]  Now, TF2 does not necessarily need a burst of fresh air underneath it to make it have people play it,
[252.27s -> 255.27s]  because there, of course, is a community behind Team Fortress 2.
[255.27s -> 258.27s]  There are still active players. It's still a really active game.
[258.27s -> 265.27s]  But at least for me, seeing these new things implemented, these new core gameplay class mechanics put in the game,
[265.27s -> 271.27s]  I get so excited. When the Heatmaker came out, I was like, oh, well, cool, the Heatmaker.
[271.27s -> 274.27s]  It's another sniper rifle. Sweet.
[274.27s -> 279.27s]  When the Huntsman came out, I was like, holy shit, what the hell is this thing?
[279.27s -> 283.27s]  The same thing. Is this a boomerang? There's a boomerang in the game right now?
[283.27s -> 286.27s]  I've got to go play this game. Holy shit, cancel all my appointments.
[286.27s -> 291.77s]  Seriously, we get excited for new things. That's the nature of human beings.
[291.77s -> 294.77s]  We look forward to things. We want to see things.
[294.77s -> 300.77s]  I'm not going to say that I'm getting sick of the same sniper rifle with different stats,
[300.77s -> 304.77s]  or the same grenade launcher or sticky bomb launcher.
[304.77s -> 307.77s]  What I'm getting is kind of not... I'm just going to say it.
[307.77s -> 313.77s]  I think I feel this way because Valve has spoiled us for so many years with free content
[313.77s -> 318.77s]  that they're just like, well, damn, we don't know what else to give you.
[318.77s -> 325.07s]  Here's another shotgun. They're spending a lot more development time in other games.
[325.07s -> 327.07s]  And I'll reiterate it one more time.
[327.07s -> 332.07s]  Balancing these items, these brand new items, can be impossible.
[332.07s -> 335.07s]  And sometimes they can break the entire game.
[335.07s -> 337.07s]  We all saw what happened with the Mini-Century.
[337.07s -> 341.07s]  When the Mini-Century first came out, people weren't really that concerned about it.
[341.07s -> 345.07s]  But the Mini-Century has really changed everything about the engineer.
[345.07s -> 349.07s]  And a lot of people do not like that and hate that item.
[349.07s -> 352.07s]  So let's say the boomerang comes out and they try to balance it.
[352.07s -> 356.07s]  They put some development time behind it, and the thing is just broken.
[356.07s -> 358.07s]  And it's really powerful. It's just unbelievable.
[358.07s -> 361.07s]  And there's no reason to ever equip the sniper rifles.
[361.07s -> 363.07s]  That stinks. That sucks.
[363.07s -> 365.07s]  But where do you balance it?
[365.07s -> 370.07s]  Where do you draw the line into what you want and what you're willing to live with?
[370.07s -> 375.38s]  Because this game was originally balanced and designed around all the stock items.
[375.38s -> 379.38s]  If you just play on a stock server, the game is supposed to be completely balanced.
[379.38s -> 380.38s]  They spent a lot of time doing that.
[380.38s -> 384.38s]  But ever since they've been implementing these items, things have changed a lot.
[384.38s -> 392.62s]  And that's something we all have to remember and realize that almost 80% of the items in this game are not release items.
[392.62s -> 395.62s]  They have been added in the last seven years.
[395.62s -> 400.98s]  But I will get off of that tangent now and wrap up the video, guys.
[400.98s -> 402.98s]  So thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[402.98s -> 404.98s]  And let me know what you think.
[404.98s -> 405.98s]  Throw some stuff in the comments section.
[405.98s -> 407.98s]  What would you like to see added as the sniper?
[407.98s -> 413.98s]  Whether it's, like I said in the beginning, if it's a primary, secondary, melee, whatever you guys think would be cool.
[413.98s -> 414.98s]  And maybe try to balance it.
[414.98s -> 418.98s]  Maybe talk about the balance issue I brought up in this conversation as well.
[418.98s -> 420.98s]  So yeah, guys, thank you so much for watching.
[420.98s -> 421.98s]  That's my time.
[421.98s -> 422.98s]  And I'll see you all next time.
[422.98s -> 425.98s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
