[325.04s -> 329.56s]  Okay, do you see this engineer which one down to the down down spawn down at the their spawn?
[329.56s -> 331.56s]  He we can literally lock him in. I
[332.12s -> 335.96s]  Don't think he'll know what's going on. You get up you get on that side. I'm gonna get on this side
[335.96s -> 344.66s]  So he can't move. Yeah, he's stuck. He doesn't care
[346.98s -> 351.93s]  Completely locked in he's confused. He's like what's going on here? What can I not move?
[352.93s -> 354.93s]  This is this is confusing me
