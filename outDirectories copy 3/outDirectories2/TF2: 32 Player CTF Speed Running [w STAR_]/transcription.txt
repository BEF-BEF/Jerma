[0.31s -> 14.68s]  We're gonna need either old-fashioned Uber charge for this one. Where are you?
[14.68s -> 19.68s]  As soon as you start healing me and we leave the door, we got ten minutes to do this.
[19.68s -> 23.86s]  Alright, wait, so the second I start healing you, we have ten minutes?
[23.86s -> 25.86s]  Yes. Start like the split.
[28.86s -> 29.86s]  Ten minutes.
[29.86s -> 31.86s]  We're not gonna make it across the field here.
[32.86s -> 35.86s]  We're on the right team. Don't get backstabbed.
[35.86s -> 37.86s]  I won't, I won't. I think that's real.
[37.86s -> 42.86s]  Wow, we're actually making some progress here. We're gonna go up into the vents and see if we can get in here.
[42.86s -> 44.86s]  Oh my god!
[44.86s -> 47.86s]  I think there were 32 people in there.
[47.86s -> 50.86s]  This heavy's gonna burn. Hold on, hold on, be careful.
[50.86s -> 52.86s]  Okay, I'm in. No, no, forget everyone else.
[52.86s -> 54.86s]  I'm gonna die.
[54.86s -> 60.27s]  I love your name, CTF Chaloge.
[60.27s -> 62.70s]  Let's go.
[62.70s -> 65.01s]  This heavy is so pissed.
[65.01s -> 67.01s]  Okay, the heavy's going first.
[67.01s -> 71.63s]  He is so pissed at me too. He's like spamming E. I feel like bad.
[71.63s -> 74.83s]  I almost got an Uber. Don't die yet.
[74.83s -> 75.83s]  Time check.
[75.83s -> 77.83s]  We're just gonna wait for someone to come to this corner because they're going to.
[77.83s -> 79.20s]  Time check.
[79.20s -> 82.20s]  I don't have the time. I don't actually have a timer right now.
[82.20s -> 84.20s]  I thought you said you were running splits.
[84.20s -> 87.20s]  I'll edit it in after. Oh my god.
[87.20s -> 89.89s]  Oh god, tell me when you want it.
[89.89s -> 94.60s]  Oh, we have it. Let's go, go, go.
[95.60s -> 98.60s]  Oh my god.
[98.60s -> 101.60s]  There is so much.
[101.60s -> 103.60s]  How do you do this?
[103.60s -> 106.03s]  How do you do this?
[106.03s -> 110.55s]  You don't, you don't. Okay, we've got them like locked in.
[110.55s -> 112.55s]  There's like 12 people up here.
[112.55s -> 114.55s]  I don't have ammo. I don't have enough ammo. We're gonna get this.
[114.55s -> 117.55s]  Watch out for this crit pile. This crit pile is gonna kill everybody.
[118.55s -> 122.71s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[122.71s -> 124.71s]  We gotta get back in the vent. Back in the vent.
[124.71s -> 125.71s]  This is tense.
[125.71s -> 127.71s]  They're gonna follow us back here.
[127.71s -> 130.71s]  Oh no, it's fine. It's fine. I'll lay some stickies.
[130.71s -> 131.71s]  Oh, you're gonna lay some shit?
[131.71s -> 132.71s]  There's gotta be a sentry down here.
[132.71s -> 134.71s]  We need to just build Uber and then go down and we can get this.
[134.71s -> 135.71s]  Okay.
[135.71s -> 139.02s]  So I'm gonna lay like a hundred stickies here.
[139.02s -> 144.02s]  A hundred? You mean, you mean eight?
[144.02s -> 146.02s]  It's five. Shut up.
[146.02s -> 148.02s]  One, two, three, four.
[148.02s -> 150.26s]  Four, five. Build your Uber.
[150.26s -> 154.26s]  When is Valve gonna fix like the fucking Medibeam bug?
[154.26s -> 156.26s]  My Medibeam is going like into the wall.
[156.26s -> 159.91s]  I can't even tell if I'm healing you or not.
[159.91s -> 162.60s]  Um, well, deal with it.
[162.60s -> 165.60s]  I got you. Look, now it looks like I'm healing you.
[165.60s -> 167.60s]  I just have to like move it in a weird direction.
[167.60s -> 169.54s]  Okay, okay.
[169.54s -> 171.72s]  Where are we going? Are we going down?
[171.72s -> 174.72s]  We're going straight down. There's definitely a sentry here.
[174.72s -> 175.72s]  Alright, you ready?
[175.72s -> 176.72s]  Go, go, go.
[176.72s -> 181.69s]  Look at this mess of a room.
[183.69s -> 186.69s]  We're so dead. We're so dead. Get it.
[187.69s -> 191.69s]  There's no way. There's no way. Look how many people there are.
[197.10s -> 201.10s]  And at that moment, I think the reality dawned on me that no, this isn't possible.
[201.10s -> 205.10s]  I thought, okay, no, maybe with this Uber, we've got Uber, we could do this.
[205.10s -> 207.10s]  Let's go. Two eggs scrambled.
[207.10s -> 210.10s]  At least we're on the red team, who's like the one who's up there.
[210.10s -> 212.92s]  I really don't know if this is...
[212.92s -> 217.10s]  Someone has it. There's a medic running back with it.
[217.10s -> 219.10s]  What a champion.
[219.10s -> 222.10s]  Wait, I have to make sure I hear these.
[223.10s -> 227.10s]  Mountain Dew, boy.
[227.10s -> 231.10s]  Well, I mean, I did destroy every sentry, so I'm going to take a little bit of credit.
[231.10s -> 233.10s]  Alright, well, let's get the third one.
[233.10s -> 236.59s]  We only got to get one more. Oh, we got crits.
[236.59s -> 239.86s]  We got crits.
[239.86s -> 243.22s]  Don't die. Don't die, Chalonge.
[243.22s -> 246.62s]  Anything in there? Anything in there?
[246.62s -> 248.62s]  Can we clean this up now?
[248.62s -> 250.62s]  Oh, there's a sentry.
[250.62s -> 251.62s]  I'm dead.
[251.62s -> 254.62s]  I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I can do this.
[254.62s -> 255.62s]  No.
[255.62s -> 257.98s]  Would you get Huntsman?
[257.98s -> 258.98s]  Yes.
[258.98s -> 260.98s]  Why didn't you shoot the heavy that was right there?
[260.98s -> 263.67s]  I would have. I would have, but I'm playing Migi.
[263.67s -> 266.67s]  Dude, I don't want to get outplayed by Mountain Dew, boy, right now.
[266.67s -> 270.67s]  Dude, Mountain Dew, boy, seriously, like, is the reason why we're going to win this.
[270.67s -> 274.30s]  Okay, I'm here behind you.
[274.30s -> 276.30s]  Scout's getting in and getting it.
[276.30s -> 278.30s]  That's it. We're going to win.
[278.30s -> 280.54s]  Is it three? Yeah, it's playing three.
[280.54s -> 282.54s]  Yeah, we got this.
[282.54s -> 286.54s]  Has it been ten minutes? Have we, like, do our initial challenge?
[286.54s -> 290.54s]  It's got to have been, like, five minutes. That's my estimation.
[290.54s -> 294.12s]  Well, we did come in here and there was one tapped.
[294.12s -> 295.12s]  We didn't actually get it.
[295.12s -> 297.62s]  No, we didn't actually do anything.
[297.62s -> 300.62s]  I don't feel satisfactory about this. That's not even a word.
[300.62s -> 302.62s]  No, he hasn't actually gotten the thing.
[302.62s -> 303.62s]  Did he get killed?
[303.62s -> 305.62s]  We've got to go back and get it.
[305.62s -> 308.62s]  I'm bumping into a Spy. I don't know where the hell he is.
[308.62s -> 311.62s]  We've got to come back to the mid.
[311.62s -> 316.08s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. He's going for me.
[316.08s -> 319.08s]  He's going for me. He's trying. He's trying his hot. He's trying his hot.
[319.08s -> 322.75s]  Jeez! I'm so screwed.
[322.75s -> 327.04s]  Uh, I think Mountain Dewboy has it.
[327.04s -> 328.04s]  Mountain Dewboy.
[328.04s -> 331.04s]  If I'm going to be completely honest with you, I think Mountain Dewboy is about to capture this.
[331.04s -> 333.04s]  Yes, he is. Mountain Dewboy just want to...
[333.04s -> 337.30s]  How could one person be that good?
[337.30s -> 339.30s]  And he's a medic.
[339.30s -> 342.48s]  Like, why is no one shooting him?
[342.48s -> 344.48s]  Mountain Dewboy. That's your answer.
[344.48s -> 355.18s]  Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. What the fuck?
[355.18s -> 357.18s]  I feel like that's not going in a video.
[366.02s -> 370.11s]  Watch out. We've got to... Never mind. He's dead.
[370.11s -> 372.11s]  He instantly exploded.
[372.11s -> 375.11s]  Because of the two centuries that...
[375.11s -> 377.11s]  What are these doing here?
[377.11s -> 380.74s]  There's two door centuries.
[380.74s -> 383.74s]  Have you ever seen a door century before? Like, work?
[383.74s -> 385.74s]  A door century? Oh my god.
[385.74s -> 387.74s]  There are door centuries here.
[387.74s -> 389.74s]  Can they even reach the corner?
[389.74s -> 390.74s]  I don't know.
[390.74s -> 392.74s]  Well, they just killed somebody.
[395.74s -> 397.74s]  Look at them.
[397.74s -> 398.74s]  Why is this working?
[398.74s -> 400.74s]  There's laser beams coming right out.
[400.74s -> 405.74s]  Why is this strategy working? This should not be working.
[405.74s -> 411.75s]  And look, you can see through here, there's another heavy with the brass bees just revved up forever.
[411.75s -> 413.99s]  Oh, yeah.
[413.99s -> 418.99s]  Come on, move up that door century. We need that hallway century pointing down this hallway.
[418.99s -> 421.99s]  I know, we're creeping it. This is called the slow push.
[421.99s -> 427.56s]  I'm barely aiming too.
[427.56s -> 431.56s]  If I shoot in this hallway, something is going to die.
[431.56s -> 433.56s]  I think four heavies.
[433.56s -> 436.56s]  I think all 16 people are standing in this hall.
[436.56s -> 441.89s]  I know, no one's going the other way. Maybe we should do a rotate, do a flanking maneuver.
[441.89s -> 445.86s]  A rotate?
[445.86s -> 447.86s]  I'm feeling confident about the flanking maneuver.
[447.86s -> 449.86s]  Well, I got 72%.
[449.86s -> 456.59s]  This guy's trying to cheeseball this century.
[456.59s -> 460.62s]  Do these heavies like not...
[460.62s -> 462.62s]  Okay, let's go the other way, other way.
[462.62s -> 467.02s]  There are too many, there are so many people in that hall.
[467.02s -> 471.28s]  It's like disgusting how many people are in there.
[471.28s -> 473.28s]  Again, you'll have double uber again.
[473.28s -> 475.28s]  Use it.
[475.28s -> 477.28s]  God, I died right when you said it.
[477.28s -> 479.28s]  You're so good.
[479.28s -> 482.28s]  It just spammed down that hallway.
[482.28s -> 486.28s]  Sorry, I can only handle so many fucking grenades coming down a fucking hallway.
[486.28s -> 491.87s]  Jeremy's mad about two free backstabs.
[491.87s -> 493.87s]  Are you still alive?
[493.87s -> 496.87s]  I'm at the hallway where the endless fight is happening.
[496.87s -> 498.87s]  You're at the endless hallway, okay.
[498.87s -> 500.87s]  And I'm ubered, apparently.
[500.87s -> 504.87s]  So you're at the hallway in Mario 64 where you go up the stairs.
[504.87s -> 506.87s]  But the stairs never end.
[506.87s -> 508.87s]  I never played that game, top comment.
[508.87s -> 510.87s]  Star never, what?
[510.87s -> 513.87s]  Wow, Star never played Mario 64?
[513.87s -> 519.25s]  What a...
[519.25s -> 523.88s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[523.88s -> 530.41s]  We could really have like five ubers coming through here.
[530.41s -> 533.41s]  There's still the sentries, there's still the sentries to deal with.
[533.41s -> 535.78s]  How many other?
[535.78s -> 537.78s]  Maybe just two.
[537.78s -> 540.14s]  We have two or three medics in this hallway.
[540.14s -> 542.14s]  I think we might get it here.
[542.14s -> 544.14s]  Heavy to the right, heavy to the right.
[544.14s -> 547.79s]  Overheal me, overheal me.
[547.79s -> 550.16s]  Is the heavy dead?
[550.16s -> 552.16s]  I can get this right now.
[552.16s -> 556.16s]  I can't, there's so many people, they're just not, back up, back up.
[556.16s -> 558.16s]  This is just going to jump in, jump out, do that kind of thing.
[558.16s -> 560.16s]  But they're already building sentries.
[560.16s -> 563.16s]  Like there's three people trying to build a sentry again.
[563.16s -> 565.16s]  Does this guy have an uber or does he have crits?
[565.16s -> 567.16s]  Heavy is dead, he has uber, we're ready to go in.
[567.16s -> 569.16s]  Alright, I got crits. Let's do it.
[569.16s -> 571.16s]  You got crits and uber.
[571.16s -> 573.53s]  Make it happen.
[573.53s -> 576.41s]  Make it happen.
[576.41s -> 580.65s]  I'm getting the domination sound once a second.
[580.65s -> 582.65s]  You're still alive, how are you still?
[582.65s -> 584.65s]  I can't, there's...
[584.65s -> 589.24s]  Get that pyro.
[589.24s -> 593.54s]  Make that pyro wish he was never born.
[593.54s -> 597.54s]  I just killed him, I don't know if that's what we're looking for.
[597.54s -> 603.54s]  Well no, because now he's dead so he can't even know he was born because his brain is gone.
[603.54s -> 607.54s]  I wanted you to make him wish he was never born, not like make him kill him.
[607.54s -> 609.54s]  Okay, well we need to go up top.
[609.54s -> 617.06s]  You didn't follow my instructions.
[617.06s -> 620.94s]  Oh, that guy has an uber.
[620.94s -> 622.94s]  Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[623.94s -> 627.65s]  Is that what we're doing?
[627.65s -> 629.65s]  Is that what we're doing?
[629.65s -> 632.77s]  What?
[632.77s -> 636.10s]  Take it off me, take it off me.
[636.10s -> 639.81s]  What?
[639.81s -> 641.81s]  Insult to injury.
[641.81s -> 644.11s]  Oh, it's over here.
[644.11s -> 646.11s]  That's interesting.
[646.11s -> 648.11s]  No, kill it, kill it.
[648.11s -> 650.11s]  No, crit.
[650.11s -> 654.26s]  I think we got it, yeah the pyro has it.
[654.26s -> 656.26s]  That made no sense.
[656.26s -> 658.26s]  No, see it's a flawless strategy.
[658.26s -> 662.07s]  When you go down the drop down it works every time.
[662.07s -> 664.07s]  There was nothing down there.
[664.07s -> 670.74s]  How would that many people that were just in that room, was there nobody there, is what I want to know.
[670.74s -> 675.66s]  That's what I want to know.
[675.66s -> 678.66s]  We are done once we get this last cap.
[678.66s -> 683.96s]  And then once we get the last cap is when we do some celebration.
[683.96s -> 692.68s]  We can celebrate the victory.
[692.68s -> 695.86s]  Look, everybody jump.
[695.86s -> 697.86s]  We did it, we did it, we did it.
[697.86s -> 699.86s]  Oh shit, we didn't do it.
[699.86s -> 703.94s]  Oh yeah, we did.
[703.94s -> 705.94s]  I got it, don't worry.
[705.94s -> 708.18s]  We have to think about celebration first.
[708.18s -> 710.18s]  Celebration, what do we do?
[710.18s -> 713.18s]  Look how dusty I am.
[713.18s -> 715.18s]  Oh, look at how dusty he is.
[715.18s -> 717.18s]  You're so dusty.
[717.18s -> 719.18s]  No, you exploded.
[719.18s -> 721.49s]  Watch out.
[723.49s -> 727.63s]  We did it.
[727.63s -> 730.63s]  Congratulations, I can't do this anymore.
[730.63s -> 732.94s]  We stayed here way longer than we should have.
[732.94s -> 734.94s]  Yeah, we did.
