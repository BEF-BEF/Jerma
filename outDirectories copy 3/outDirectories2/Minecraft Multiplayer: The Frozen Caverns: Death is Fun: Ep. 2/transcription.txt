[0.31s -> 15.32s]  So is this going to be like a little hotel? This is uh, it's going to be like a little...
[16.46s -> 22.28s]  How? Hey, I'm not sleeping with like three dudes clumped up in one little area. I feel like I'm
[22.28s -> 31.48s]  back in college. Alright, here's a crafting table and we can't make... Do we have coal?
[31.48s -> 39.75s]  Anyone have coal? Anybody? It's down there. By the tree. By the tree. Okay, well we need a pick to do
[39.75s -> 53.22s]  that. I'm gonna make a leather helmet and I'm gonna make a leather... I don't know. Alright,
[53.22s -> 60.71s]  I have a wooden pick now. Alright, I have leather pants and a leather helmet. I'm gonna look like a
[60.71s -> 75.06s]  clown. You look all steampunk with this texture pack on. I look like I have a cardboard box on my
[75.06s -> 79.86s]  head. Yeah, I think we're all using different texture packs. It's pretty cool. I'm using Snacks
[79.86s -> 87.35s]  PRBD. I'm using the default. That's a good one, you know. That's the classic right there. I'm using
[87.35s -> 97.14s]  the classic. So don't... Did you guys plant the saplings? Don't dig this out. There, let's
[98.26s -> 105.70s]  put the door down right there. So I'm gonna plant a tree right here. I'm making my way
[106.87s -> 111.75s]  through the snow. I can't plant a tree anywhere. You have to do it on the dirt. Oh,
[112.47s -> 120.55s]  uh, right. He's way over there. He's exploring without us, man. We're like building structures
[120.55s -> 127.67s]  and houses and stuff. I'm playing with fire right now. I'm throwing snowballs at this enderman
[127.67s -> 132.55s]  that's all the way up there. No, we might throw snowballs. Put the door down right here, man.
[133.11s -> 142.79s]  Oops. Oops. I got sticky keys that did not like that. Okay. So we make a door.
[145.00s -> 151.16s]  I think you have one. I made one. Oh, God. Mops are dropping down on me. Oh, look at this little
[151.16s -> 162.33s]  house. Oh, yeah. Julius Caesar would have lived in this house. And just unlimited glass. I have
[162.33s -> 167.61s]  three stacks of 64 glass. All right. I want my bed to go right here. I want a picture of my favorite
[167.61s -> 173.37s]  president. Uh, Grover Cleveland right here. And then I want, um, a cop to go right here.
[174.89s -> 179.02s]  We need to find some sheep. I don't think we're going to find any sheep.
[179.58s -> 182.78s]  Uh, we're going to find a bunch of leptors. Just look at this.
[182.78s -> 186.78s]  Left is up there being like a one man army. Oh, I just fell. Yeah.
[188.94s -> 195.06s]  I'll get your stuff, man. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, zombie. Get away. All right. Oh, my God.
[195.06s -> 203.66s]  I'm getting knocked all over the place. Oh, there's a creeper and a zombie. Oh, my God.
[205.03s -> 213.58s]  Okay. Creeper blew up. I'm cool. All right. Here's some leather stuff. No problem. I'll make some
[215.16s -> 220.04s]  other stuff as well. I am. We need to make a chest.
[222.42s -> 228.10s]  Welcome back. I have something for you. You do? What do you got? Let me see. What is this? Do we
[228.10s -> 234.09s]  have like a new friend? Is this like our God dog? What is this guy doing? He's, he is, uh,
[234.09s -> 245.59s]  defending the fort, man. That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey you, I'm talking to you. He's, he's waiting
[245.59s -> 250.87s]  patiently for the lepter to come out. You look at me when I'm talking to you. All right.
[251.67s -> 259.10s]  Oh, well I just hit him. He's dead. Nice. All right guys. Here you go. All right. We do have
[259.10s -> 263.59s]  some bones. He's got an iron sword and I'm over here trying to pass out wooden swords.
[264.39s -> 270.36s]  Hey, I'll take a wooden sword. I will absolutely take a wooden sword. It's starting to be daytime
[270.36s -> 279.43s]  now. I'm going to do a travel. Germa, pass me your, that bone you picked up. Here you go. I have it
[279.43s -> 288.78s]  now. It's my bone. My one and only bone. I put two more bones in the chest. So we got, we got some,
[288.78s -> 294.30s]  some miracle grow right here. Oh, I thought you were just looking at your pants.
[295.10s -> 300.70s]  You look like Steve Urkel. You got your pants are like all the way up to like to your belly button.
[300.70s -> 304.22s]  All right. Back up, Germa. Back up a lot. They're all going to die.
[307.37s -> 311.77s]  Yeah. They blew it up. Ha ha. Yeah. This is all, there's a bunch. This is two or three in there
[311.77s -> 319.45s]  still. I'm going down. I'm going to bring the bow. And then, then there was one. I thought he got
[319.45s -> 323.93s]  him. I thought he got him. Let's go together. Hang on. Hang on. There's still, there's something
[323.93s -> 328.01s]  in here. Look, look, look. This is what I wanted to explore before. I think, was there only one more
[328.01s -> 333.70s]  in there? Did you get them? Was, was there only one more creeper in there? Yeah. He blew up.
[333.70s -> 339.62s]  All right. There's nothing in here now. Oh God. There's one in here. All right. Here's the thing.
[339.62s -> 345.06s]  We got to get back and get our stuff before it disappears. But sweet. I finished them off.
[345.14s -> 350.58s]  Why are these, why are these two fighting each other? Because one of them took damage from the
[350.58s -> 357.58s]  other. Taking these guys down. I'm almost out of food though. So kind of a problem.
[358.46s -> 366.12s]  Get out of here, spider. Anybody got any food? I need arrows. Do you guys have arrows? I, yeah. I
[366.12s -> 374.34s]  do not. All right. Cool. All right. Zombies are the primary target here. Yo, there's electric.
[374.34s -> 380.71s]  Actually, let's just go to the melon farm. Yo, that's. Venom sack. Venom sack. Really should
[380.71s -> 391.02s]  have attacked his ring today. Yeah. But where's the fun in that? So. Oh, there's another one though.
[391.02s -> 394.62s]  Come at me. Watch out. Come at me. Everybody. Let's go. Don't, don't, don't go that way.
[397.34s -> 400.46s]  All of you. We'll take every single one of you on right now.
[403.02s -> 409.42s]  Oh, there goes Jerma. But he took one for the team. Hey, at least we got some zombie flesh.
[410.86s -> 420.87s]  Okay. So try to stay on the same path. Man, this bridge freaks me out. Yeah, it really does. It's
[420.87s -> 427.45s]  just like, where am I going to fall down? Drop that skelly on the left. Oh, there's a chest down
[427.45s -> 437.35s]  there. Forget the chest, man. We got to get that enchanted bow. Except everyone is. I think
[437.35s -> 443.51s]  Jerma went the wrong way. Did I go the wrong way? Oh, there he goes. Watch out. There's a skeleton
[443.51s -> 447.75s]  that's on you. Except for me and you left there. I looked over to see you because I heard you say,
[447.75s -> 450.07s]  I think you went the wrong way. I turned and I fell.
