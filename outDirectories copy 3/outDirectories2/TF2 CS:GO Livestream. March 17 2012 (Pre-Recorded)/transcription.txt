[14.20s -> 32.13s]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Testing out stuff. Testing out the stream. Testing out the stream. Testing out stuff. Testing out the stream. Testing out the stream.
[32.13s -> 68.84s]  Oh, test it. Test it. Alright. Good enough.
[68.84s -> 92.52s]  Noto!
[92.52s -> 113.64s]  Oh yeah. Somebody gotta stop that bomb.
[113.64s -> 119.29s]  Alright, let me get out of here. Let me just get out. Oh, I got a new item. Sick.
[119.29s -> 133.86s]  Okay. Are we live? I hope so.
[133.86s -> 144.74s]  Pop this out.
[144.74s -> 169.70s]  Alright. Okay. Looks like we're live.
[169.70s -> 182.14s]  Should be. Oh, we are. There we are. Hey guys.
[182.14s -> 186.14s]  Pop that out.
[186.14s -> 190.14s]  Okay. There we go.
[190.14s -> 204.84s]  Let's lower this. Alrighty.
[204.84s -> 213.35s]  Okay. Hello. Oh, I gotta tell people I'm streaming.
[213.35s -> 222.76s]  Gonna play some CSGO tonight. Along with some TF2.
[222.76s -> 230.18s]  Oh, happy St. Patrick's Day everybody. I didn't even say that.
[230.18s -> 239.74s]  This is a second livestream on YouTube.
[239.74s -> 243.74s]  Hopefully it goes well. Hopefully nothing explodes.
[243.74s -> 252.76s]  But yeah, happy St. Patrick's Day. May the luck of the Irish shine upon you.
[252.76s -> 266.71s]  I'm gonna find a better server than that. I do live in Boston.
[266.71s -> 274.84s]  One, two, three. I'm reading it. Alright, let's get this going.
[274.84s -> 282.07s]  Alright, hold on. I gotta tell my Steam group what's going on.
[282.07s -> 289.00s]  Because I'm trying to do the transition from Twitch to YouTube.
[289.00s -> 293.00s]  So we'll see how it goes. I got a lot of
[293.00s -> 297.00s]  mixed responses. A lot of people are like, no, go to Twitch. And then people say, no,
[297.00s -> 301.00s]  YouTube is much better. It's torn between two different places.
[301.00s -> 305.00s]  But eventually I'm gonna be able to stream in HD on here.
[305.00s -> 309.62s]  So that should be pretty cool. And why can't I go to my Steam group?
[309.62s -> 319.80s]  Oh, right. I'm not even online. Whoops!
[319.80s -> 326.92s]  Let's get to an event. Saturday YouTube
[326.92s -> 341.00s]  stream. Oh, potty.
[341.00s -> 359.74s]  And play. Woohoo!
[359.74s -> 374.26s]  Alright, let's get a server here. It has nobody in it. Alright, zero out of
[374.26s -> 379.72s]  28. Arena Lumberyard? I don't know if I wanna go there.
[379.72s -> 387.22s]  One, two, three. Let's get zero out of 32. Here we go. Here we go.
[387.22s -> 394.07s]  Zero out of 32. That's what I'm looking for. Warmfront.
[394.07s -> 403.42s]  Casbah. King of the Hill Nucleus. Let's go to Nucleus.
[403.42s -> 407.78s]  Alright, guys. This is the server I'm playing on right now.
[407.78s -> 427.35s]  And here it comes. We'll let everybody go. Yo!
[427.35s -> 433.26s]  My stream's broken. My stream isn't broken, is it?
[433.26s -> 455.13s]  Try and refresh it. Give it a good ol' refresh. Alright,
[455.13s -> 459.56s]  join that. I just put an IP into the chat and that's where I'm gonna be playing.
[459.56s -> 472.68s]  Oh, using the Floggestinator. I'm not gonna play with that.
[472.68s -> 482.79s]  Play Soldier. Anybody even in here? Alright, Weston.
[482.79s -> 487.42s]  If some of you guys could repost the IP, I'd be very grateful.
[487.42s -> 501.74s]  Give him hell. What's going on, chicken?
[501.74s -> 508.02s]  So I have a new mouse. We're gonna see how well this goes. How did I not hit that guy?
[508.02s -> 512.26s]  I got a Razor Deathadder. Ow!
[512.26s -> 520.09s]  Yeah, Razor Deathadder. It's the blue one. The one that lights up blue.
[520.09s -> 529.56s]  Never gonna give. Never gonna give. So, a lot of
[529.56s -> 543.27s]  people can't load the stream. I wonder why. Everything should
[543.27s -> 552.50s]  be the same as it was last time. Is more than one person having stream problems?
[552.50s -> 560.44s]  Or is it just one or two people? Error, huh?
[560.44s -> 572.98s]  Hold on a second. That's weird. The people that are having problems,
[572.98s -> 578.68s]  what country are you from?
[578.68s -> 582.68s]  It might be because you're from a country that doesn't support it or something.
[582.68s -> 592.74s]  YouTube is still in kind of like the beta streaming stages.
[592.74s -> 602.73s]  Oh my God. I can't believe I...
[602.73s -> 608.57s]  How? Yeah, I guess if you're having stream problems,
[608.57s -> 612.57s]  just close out your browser and then come back or clear out
[612.57s -> 617.06s]  some of your cookies or something like that. I don't know. I wish I knew what was going on.
[617.06s -> 621.06s]  If everybody was having that problem, I would be like, Darn! I'd have to fix it right away.
[621.06s -> 632.78s]  Oh, that was so lucky. Oh, you're under the spy?
[632.78s -> 637.40s]  Oh my God.
[637.40s -> 644.12s]  Yeah.
[644.12s -> 654.30s]  Let me just look at my own stream and see what happens.
[654.30s -> 658.30s]  Gonna pull it up for a second here. Just wanna see what it looks like for me.
[658.30s -> 664.12s]  Expedia. Let's see.
[664.12s -> 669.82s]  Why did I just get a double add?
[669.82s -> 679.69s]  I got a double add on my own stream.
[679.69s -> 683.69s]  Offer a sacrifice to YouTube. I mean, it looks... Yeah, I'll show you guys. We'll do streamception.
[683.69s -> 689.19s]  It looks alright on my end. I don't know.
[689.19s -> 693.19s]  I'm not sure, guys. I apologize if it doesn't look like that
[693.19s -> 698.07s]  on your screen. Oh my God, look at all these people.
[698.07s -> 703.27s]  High five, baby. Oh, we're gonna get spawn trapped. Everyone's
[703.27s -> 715.82s]  just in here hanging out. Oh, crit screen. Oh no.
[715.82s -> 722.41s]  Put a lot of pressure on me here. That's not a spy.
[722.41s -> 730.23s]  Oh my God. It's lagging so bad.
[730.23s -> 735.88s]  Oh God. I just hit like a lag patch right there. That wasn't good.
[735.88s -> 741.59s]  Oh yeah, I'll show my loadouts. Good call. Good call, Luke.
[741.59s -> 746.54s]  Oh, I just missed your name. Good call, Phoenix. So right now
[746.54s -> 751.22s]  I'm using the black box, the reserve shooter, and the equalizer. And
[751.22s -> 771.19s]  I got this stuff on, too. There we go. Let's do it.
[771.19s -> 779.02s]  Alright, so I'm getting a couple more messages saying the
[779.02s -> 787.35s]  stream is all screwed up. Now we're gonna do this, right? We'll do this.
[787.35s -> 793.05s]  I'm not sure if I can even restart it, to be honest. It might like
[793.05s -> 814.87s]  screw a bunch of stuff up. Yes. We'll go scout.
[814.87s -> 819.30s]  I got the mad milk. The stock.
[819.30s -> 823.74s]  Stock. Oh crap. No, die.
[823.74s -> 830.66s]  Well, the only thing I can say is if people are still having
[830.66s -> 834.66s]  problems, then this should be uploaded
[834.66s -> 839.16s]  to YouTube within the next hour or two. You should be able to watch it on
[839.16s -> 850.25s]  YouTube. I don't know. Maybe I'll try restarting it, because it looks like
[850.25s -> 858.84s]  more people are having problems. Control point enabled. Get going.
[858.84s -> 866.92s]  Yeah, it's a razor death adder. I like it. It's good.
[866.92s -> 870.92s]  I'm not a big fan of big bulky mice, but this is
[870.92s -> 877.50s]  this fits comfortably. Oh, damn.
[877.50s -> 890.68s]  Oh my god, they're right outside the door.
[890.68s -> 896.44s]  That just like scared the crap out of me. No, I'm going this way.
[896.44s -> 903.30s]  Let's get out of here. Come on, spy. Let's get the hell out of here.
[903.30s -> 908.89s]  I'm lagging so bad. Look at how bad I'm lagging
[908.89s -> 920.87s]  right now. Everyone's like a freaking slideshow. Streamception.
[920.87s -> 930.04s]  Did I kill that guy? I just confused myself.
[930.04s -> 936.89s]  I can't believe I made it.
[936.89s -> 943.80s]  Logitech all day.
[943.80s -> 953.86s]  Yeah, actually, you know what? If some of you guys will notice,
[953.86s -> 958.10s]  I have quick switch on now. I am not using the regular
[958.10s -> 962.34s]  non-quick switch anymore, because I can do stuff like this. See how I switch
[962.34s -> 969.53s]  that? Because I got a button on my thumb now. I can use the button on my thumb
[969.53s -> 974.26s]  to switch to the melee slot.
[974.26s -> 978.26s]  Cool, huh? No more slow switch for Jerma.
[978.26s -> 985.77s]  Those are the days of the past. Oh my god, so many people
[985.77s -> 991.21s]  up there. Chris Krieg, oh my god.
[991.21s -> 996.79s]  Hold on, I'm gonna go... I'm going Soldier.
[996.79s -> 1001.46s]  No, no, no, no. Somebody said go Combat Engie. I will.
[1001.46s -> 1007.43s]  I will go Combat Engie. Oh my god, they got us like
[1007.43s -> 1023.24s]  spawn-trapped. We are spawn-trapped.
[1023.24s -> 1030.92s]  Anybody up here? Sentry down. Sentry down?
[1030.92s -> 1037.40s]  How am I... It's giving me a break. I got one
[1037.40s -> 1041.96s]  hit on that guy. Oh my god, I just realized something.
[1041.96s -> 1047.03s]  I don't have the gunslinger on.
[1047.03s -> 1051.03s]  Are you serious? Alright, well, whatever. This works.
[1051.03s -> 1063.24s]  Nice. Big sentry, baby. Oh no.
[1063.24s -> 1069.78s]  Oh no. Oh no, I have no metal. That's fine, take it out.
[1069.78s -> 1074.73s]  I don't care. What just even happened to me right there?
[1074.73s -> 1078.73s]  What is going on? There's so much lag on this server.
[1078.73s -> 1084.12s]  Jerma, the girl I have is... Do you have any dating advice?
[1084.12s -> 1089.69s]  Do I have any dating advice? The only
[1089.69s -> 1093.99s]  dating advice I could give is... I don't know.
[1093.99s -> 1099.26s]  I'm not really the best at... I gotta take this off.
[1099.26s -> 1104.58s]  I'm not really the best at dating advice, to be honest. If I had any, I would definitely give it to you.
[1104.58s -> 1110.36s]  The only thing I can really say is, don't pretend to be somebody
[1110.36s -> 1115.43s]  and not. Because after a while, people find out.
[1115.43s -> 1120.38s]  That's pretty much the only advice I can really give. Oh, stair stab.
[1120.38s -> 1132.15s]  Where did my sentry even go? What just happened? What even just happened to me?
[1132.15s -> 1137.22s]  No, I am not stoned. I am not.
[1137.22s -> 1141.22s]  I don't do that. Drug free up in here.
[1141.22s -> 1155.22s]  Dating advice. It's a trap.
[1155.22s -> 1159.22s]  We gotta get him away from the spawn. I'm going the other way. My god.
[1159.22s -> 1167.74s]  Get in the face. Wait, how did I not... No, I'm gonna die.
[1167.74s -> 1175.18s]  And that's a spy. Oh yeah, I got like a dozen extra eggs
[1175.18s -> 1179.99s]  here. I have two dozen eggs. No, I'm just kidding.
[1179.99s -> 1183.99s]  No more eggs for me. Not unless I make a stupid bet with myself.
[1183.99s -> 1190.39s]  Oh, did I make it? I made it. Alright, I made it.
[1190.39s -> 1197.32s]  Made it out of the spawn door. I'll probably stream for an hour or two.
[1197.32s -> 1207.18s]  Oh my god, that just scared the crap out of me.
[1207.18s -> 1215.82s]  Yes, I am playing in a window.
[1215.82s -> 1228.81s]  I am in a window. Get him off the port.
[1228.81s -> 1237.78s]  Punch him in the face. Eggs. No, I'm not from New Jersey.
[1237.78s -> 1244.01s]  I'm from Boston. I'm from the bean town. And if you're just joining the stream,
[1244.01s -> 1248.01s]  happy St. Patrick's Day. If you happen to be of Irish descent.
[1248.01s -> 1252.57s]  I am of Irish descent, so. Later on, after this stream,
[1252.57s -> 1256.57s]  I'm going with my family. We're gonna go get some corned beef and cabbage
[1256.57s -> 1261.32s]  at a restaurant. Should be a good time. Get to see some
[1261.32s -> 1266.84s]  aunts and uncles I haven't seen in a little while, so. Should be cool.
[1266.84s -> 1271.08s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't, oh my god.
[1271.08s -> 1275.08s]  How did I survive that? Holy crap.
[1275.08s -> 1280.54s]  I need like health. I can't believe I survived that.
[1280.54s -> 1289.18s]  Come on, come on, come on. Just at least give me like, oh,
[1289.18s -> 1293.35s]  what am I doing? My brain just like exploded right there.
[1293.35s -> 1297.98s]  I'm trying to like, will I build something and just die with crit?
[1297.98s -> 1306.04s]  I idiot. I just ran into a spy. At least I think I did.
[1306.04s -> 1310.79s]  Oh, we really, we're doing this well? Overtime?
[1310.79s -> 1316.94s]  I'll take that. Oh, jump over the
[1316.94s -> 1322.52s]  rocket. I just rocket jumped with his rocket. Right now it is 6pm.
[1322.52s -> 1329.37s]  Eastern time. Do I like streaming on Twitch or
[1329.37s -> 1335.46s]  YouTube? I think they both have their own little perks. For instance, I think more
[1335.46s -> 1339.46s]  people can watch a Twitch livestream because Twitch is available in
[1339.46s -> 1344.84s]  more areas. Yeah, Twitch is available
[1344.84s -> 1348.84s]  in more places. I think that the reason why people are having problems with this stream
[1348.84s -> 1352.84s]  is YouTube streams are not available all over the
[1352.84s -> 1356.84s]  place in the world. I'm pretty sure that's the problem people are having.
[1356.84s -> 1364.58s]  Is there no damage spread on this server? How did I not hit him?
[1364.58s -> 1373.48s]  Don't get yourself killed. Run away. Oh, come on.
[1373.48s -> 1379.51s]  No, get that scout.
[1379.51s -> 1385.14s]  Oh, what? What is...
[1385.14s -> 1393.40s]  Oh, I thought I died from the flamethrower. Arby's
[1393.40s -> 1397.40s]  corned beef. You know what? There is no Arby's around here. I wish there was
[1397.40s -> 1402.02s]  an Arby's around here. I'd go there every day. Those of you that have Arby's
[1402.02s -> 1406.02s]  near you, is it any good? I always see the commercials and I'm like, God, I want one of those
[1406.02s -> 1414.73s]  roast beef sandwiches. Spy...
[1414.73s -> 1422.04s]  Sure, why not. Mission begins in ten seconds.
[1422.04s -> 1427.94s]  Oh, that's fine. That's fine with me. I'll just bump into you.
[1427.94s -> 1433.32s]  I'll just bump into you. Look, I am heavy.
[1433.32s -> 1437.32s]  Oh my God, that's such baloney. That is
[1437.32s -> 1442.26s]  baloney. Slow mo that back. I backstabbed him.
[1442.26s -> 1450.76s]  Did we lose? What? How did it...
[1450.76s -> 1454.76s]  Hold on, did you guys hear that? It just said, you fail victory. What was that?
[1454.76s -> 1463.54s]  You fail victory.
[1463.54s -> 1469.05s]  I actually hit him. Hit me with that crit rocket.
[1469.05s -> 1476.47s]  Oh, get out of my way. Oh no, get out of my way.
[1476.47s -> 1482.74s]  Look, I'm a heavy. A sick minigun.
[1482.74s -> 1491.77s]  Oh, boink. Oh, come on, get me behind all
[1491.77s -> 1500.92s]  these bastards. My gloves are running
[1500.92s -> 1504.92s]  urgently and I'm running wicked slow. That's not like a total giveaway.
[1504.92s -> 1511.14s]  You too. No, no, no more heavy disguise.
[1511.14s -> 1521.34s]  Oh, this guy's eating a sandwich.
[1521.34s -> 1527.35s]  Oh boy. Damn it. So Arby's really is terrible.
[1527.35s -> 1533.64s]  My processor, how many gigahertz is your processor? It is 3.6
[1533.64s -> 1537.94s]  gigahertz, I believe. It's overclocked. It is an overclocked
[1537.94s -> 1559.98s]  Intel i7950.
[1559.98s -> 1564.47s]  I'm a real engineer, don't worry. Oh, chaos stab.
[1564.47s -> 1578.25s]  Give me a chaos stab. Yeah, I do apologize if you're getting errors on here.
[1578.25s -> 1582.25s]  There's not a whole lot I can really do about it besides just not stream.
[1582.25s -> 1591.46s]  Come on, back up a little bit.
[1591.46s -> 1598.89s]  Damn. I got a GTX 470
[1598.89s -> 1603.62s]  NVIDIA. EVGA edition. I think that's also
[1603.62s -> 1608.25s]  clocked too. That's overclocked as well. I got a lot of overclocked
[1608.25s -> 1615.62s]  stuff. Not going to be good up here.
[1615.62s -> 1632.63s]  Get away, get away, get away, get away. Talking about like face
[1632.63s -> 1636.63s]  stabs, I still have not gotten a stair stab. Not once
[1636.63s -> 1640.63s]  in the entire time I've ever played Team Fortress 2. Never gotten a
[1640.63s -> 1645.26s]  Oh my god. A stair stab. Oh, now I did. Nope.
[1645.26s -> 1649.26s]  There's like 12 people in this hallway. How did I get killed?
[1649.26s -> 1663.90s]  Get that scalp, bastard. Oh, you're not
[1663.90s -> 1673.05s]  going to get away. Not going to get away. Let's go
[1673.05s -> 1679.58s]  I'm going to go sniper costume. Let's go sniper costume, baby.
[1679.58s -> 1684.65s]  Oh, I'm just sniping. Just sniping. Hold on, we got to like be careful
[1684.65s -> 1688.65s]  here. Like let me in the spawn. Let me in like the spawn door.
[1688.65s -> 1699.66s]  Damn it.
[1699.66s -> 1710.09s]  Run away, run away.
[1710.09s -> 1714.09s]  Oh no. That would have been my first stair stab ever.
[1714.09s -> 1719.61s]  Hey buddy. Damn it. That would have been my first stair stab ever.
[1719.61s -> 1727.86s]  I will get one of those damn things.
[1727.86s -> 1731.86s]  Damn. How did I not get that? I'm just going to
[1731.86s -> 1735.86s]  I'm going to get a stair stab. It's going to happen.
[1735.86s -> 1746.55s]  Today we're going to go stair stabbing.
[1746.55s -> 1751.99s]  I'll go heavy. We need a heavy. I'll go
[1751.99s -> 1756.23s]  Tommy Slav heavy. I got on the
[1756.23s -> 1760.23s]  Tommy Slav. What else do I got?
[1760.23s -> 1765.74s]  Crit Rocket. Damn. After this round
[1765.74s -> 1769.74s]  we're going to go to a new server. Get to a new empty server.
[1769.74s -> 1777.54s]  This is my heavy setup. Oh god, five seconds
[1777.54s -> 1783.90s]  left. Are we like losing or winning? I don't even remember. Oh, looks like we're winning.
[1783.90s -> 1794.33s]  Where's that guy coming from? We did it. Hooray.
[1794.33s -> 1799.13s]  I'll follow you to the depths of hell. Alright, new server.
[1799.13s -> 1811.74s]  The next server is going to be refresh. Oh,
[1811.74s -> 1819.59s]  stair stab with a heavy.
[1819.59s -> 1828.23s]  Let's go to
[1828.23s -> 1832.23s]  32. Here we go. Stop refresh. Gold Rush.
[1832.23s -> 1837.18s]  Control Point Kings. Looks like we're going to go here.
[1837.18s -> 1846.84s]  New server for stream.
[1846.84s -> 1856.17s]  Here you go. Putting it in the chat right now.
[1856.17s -> 1863.08s]  There it is. Everybody go there if you can make it.
[1863.08s -> 1868.41s]  I have not played Tribes of San Tony. I'm thinking about getting into it. Thinking about trying to get
[1868.41s -> 1873.22s]  into the open beta. I just really haven't had time to be honest.
[1873.22s -> 1877.53s]  I've been doing a whole lot of TV watching lately.
[1877.53s -> 1882.60s]  Plus I got that new dog and I've been kind of busy lately.
[1882.60s -> 1888.38s]  It's been tough to get into new games. At least the last week or so.
[1888.38s -> 1903.75s]  Let's go red. How can I keep getting defaulted
[1903.75s -> 1917.50s]  to the Pyro spray?
[1917.50s -> 1928.26s]  I love that. I want to do that too. Quick! No! Too late.
[1928.26s -> 1932.26s]  I'm going to play engineer. I'm going to play real engineer.
[1932.26s -> 1936.26s]  I'm going to be a weird engineer. Weird bastard.
[1936.26s -> 1940.89s]  Let's put it down. What's my pink?
[1940.89s -> 1949.72s]  I can see your comment. Help me build this Pyro. Thanks dude.
[1949.72s -> 1956.39s]  My opinion on the very controversial subject of bread.
[1956.39s -> 1960.39s]  Well, obviously bread is an incredibly, incredibly controversial
[1960.39s -> 1964.39s]  subject. I think that the best kind of bread
[1964.39s -> 1968.39s]  is wheat bread. But then of course the white bread will get really irritated
[1968.39s -> 1972.39s]  with that. And the rye bread might rise up and take over the wheat
[1972.39s -> 1976.39s]  country of Dylstalu. So I like to stay pretty neutral.
[1976.39s -> 1989.38s]  Bam! My brain just exploded right there.
[1989.38s -> 1997.53s]  What am I doing? I thought I was on offense for a second. Where the hell is
[1997.53s -> 2001.53s]  Shibby? Where is Shibby2142? Oh, he's probably working right now.
[2001.53s -> 2006.92s]  He's a real working man now.
[2006.92s -> 2011.10s]  Do we have six NGs? Oh my god.
[2011.10s -> 2015.98s]  Okay. Let's do it.
[2015.98s -> 2020.78s]  I'll help you with this at least. It's the least I can do.
[2020.78s -> 2024.95s]  Oh my god. Well, it looks like we crashed the server.
[2024.95s -> 2028.95s]  Don't worry everybody. We have every entrance secure.
[2028.95s -> 2032.95s]  All we need is one pointing down the stairs. And you're talking about hystericalness.
[2032.95s -> 2039.99s]  Oh my god. This server is laggy as hell.
[2039.99s -> 2043.99s]  Oh my god. Alright, I'm moving. I'm going down here.
[2043.99s -> 2049.19s]  I'm going right here. They don't even know I'm here either.
[2049.19s -> 2055.22s]  Excuse me, they have revenge crits. That's all I'm caring about right now. I'll change classes
[2055.22s -> 2060.79s]  after this. Oh, that's a spy. What?
[2060.79s -> 2066.38s]  What? What? What? Oh, it's cause every...
[2066.38s -> 2070.38s]  Oh my god. Look at these pinks.
[2070.38s -> 2076.14s]  Look at these pinks. Holy crap.
[2076.14s -> 2083.45s]  Oh, well it looks like we just broke this guy's server.
[2083.45s -> 2089.48s]  Hey, Mr. WLF. Sorry, but we
[2089.48s -> 2099.34s]  broke your server. Yeah, new server.
[2099.34s -> 2103.82s]  New server. Oh god.
[2103.82s -> 2107.82s]  Alright, time just to shoot people with a pistol until I die again and then I'm changing.
[2107.82s -> 2115.11s]  Oh, I'm going to go on a tirade. Yeah, new server. This place
[2115.11s -> 2120.82s]  is ridiculous. How about...
[2120.82s -> 2136.10s]  What is Casbah? Do another refresh. Yeah, somebody
[2136.10s -> 2140.10s]  in there had like 900 ping. Oh my god.
[2140.10s -> 2153.48s]  Forget that. There we go. We might have to go
[2153.48s -> 2157.48s]  into a 24 or a 30. Let's see, this one's 29.
[2157.48s -> 2164.46s]  We'll go to capture the flag well. Why not? More spots.
[2164.46s -> 2171.51s]  Alright, this is where we're going. This new server.
[2171.51s -> 2184.25s]  Here we are. Everyone head there. Hopefully this place doesn't
[2184.25s -> 2192.65s]  crash. Yeah, if you're getting the stream error, try closing
[2192.65s -> 2196.65s]  out your browser and clearing out your browser history
[2196.65s -> 2200.65s]  like your cache and all that and then try coming back in. That seems to have been
[2200.65s -> 2218.89s]  working for some people. Hot time!
[2218.89s -> 2230.98s]  I just wrote the IP. Oh, let me write
[2230.98s -> 2251.02s]  this. I don't think people can... Hold on. Let's try it.
[2251.02s -> 2256.28s]  I'm going to write this in the chat just because some people... There we go.
[2256.28s -> 2272.97s]  There we go. That didn't go through?
[2272.97s -> 2285.46s]  Oh god, this server is like no better.
[2285.46s -> 2297.69s]  Yeah, I posted the IP earlier. That's a spy. I like the black box better
[2297.69s -> 2301.69s]  personally in my opinion. Oh my word!
[2301.69s -> 2306.76s]  I just think the black box is just... I don't know. Oh my god, by the damn
[2306.76s -> 2311.43s]  drain!
[2311.43s -> 2318.86s]  That was heinous.
[2318.86s -> 2322.86s]  Oh man, I've never done so many cartwheels in my life.
[2322.86s -> 2333.02s]  Geez. Give me that elf.
[2333.02s -> 2338.09s]  Oh, bird of prey mode. I'm going to drill here.
[2338.09s -> 2345.66s]  Damn. Mini-saturn.
[2345.66s -> 2356.07s]  The enemy has dropped our intelligence. Whoa, what was that?
[2356.07s -> 2360.82s]  I just heard a bunch of noise going on over there. You can't use your flames in
[2360.82s -> 2370.94s]  here. Whoa. Nice dispenser.
[2370.94s -> 2376.97s]  Yeah, screw that train. Now I'm not getting hit by the train again.
[2376.97s -> 2380.97s]  That would have been two in a row. That would have been two train travesties
[2380.97s -> 2391.08s]  in a row. I don't want to kill that medic.
[2391.08s -> 2395.90s]  I'm on fire now. Good for that water. Gotta get in the water.
[2395.90s -> 2402.63s]  Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Oh my god. Chaos.
[2402.63s -> 2410.31s]  Oh, I'm so dead.
[2410.31s -> 2418.07s]  Oh, I'm going to drown. I'm making a run for it. Let's go all the way
[2418.07s -> 2423.14s]  to the back of their base. Now they got a big sentry over here.
[2423.14s -> 2427.14s]  Oh, not that I can take it out. Oh! No! God! Why did I
[2427.14s -> 2432.28s]  crouch? Why did I crouch? Oh my god.
[2432.28s -> 2438.55s]  Oh, what the hell?
[2438.55s -> 2443.22s]  That was B-U.
[2443.22s -> 2448.30s]  You know the rest. L-L. Could have taken that thing out.
[2448.30s -> 2460.38s]  Would I like to see TF3? I would love to see a TF3.
[2460.38s -> 2464.38s]  I don't think it'll ever happen though. I think they're kind of
[2464.38s -> 2468.38s]  going to stick with the community idea thing and let the community run with it and
[2468.38s -> 2474.97s]  I'm going to die. I'll play sniper. I'll play sniper with
[2474.97s -> 2480.68s]  the cozy camper. I got the coat. Let's see what it looks like. Yeah, see there it is.
[2480.68s -> 2491.45s]  Cozy camper. Are there really slot reservations here?
[2491.45s -> 2495.45s]  Oh, what am I doing? Why am I running in there like that? Oh, I got the cozy camper.
[2495.45s -> 2502.10s]  It doesn't even matter. I'm not going to flinch.
[2502.10s -> 2511.58s]  How am I missing this guy? Oh, how are they just
[2511.58s -> 2520.92s]  running by us all? Come here, you bastard!
[2520.92s -> 2525.10s]  What new items would I like to see in TF? A...
[2525.10s -> 2531.32s]  What? Run! Run! No! My friend! Oh, come on.
[2531.32s -> 2541.05s]  Come over here. Oh, come on! That would have been sick.
[2541.05s -> 2546.31s]  No, get that! A weapon I like to see in TF is a
[2546.31s -> 2551.51s]  new engineer primary that's not a shotgun.
[2551.51s -> 2556.20s]  I guess they kind of already did that with the Pomsom.
[2556.20s -> 2560.20s]  But it's still technically a shotgun. I'd like to see a total
[2560.20s -> 2573.18s]  replacement for the shotgun. Damn.
[2573.18s -> 2578.76s]  We'll protect that medic. Damn. I got to put all the... I got to put the...
[2578.76s -> 2582.94s]  So is it true that this works? The cozy camper works with the huntsman?
[2582.94s -> 2594.14s]  Yeah, there's probably some bug in the YouTube streaming right now, to be honest.
[2594.14s -> 2598.14s]  Because there should not be double ads playing. That just should not
[2598.14s -> 2607.50s]  be happening. Hold on. Are you stuck in an infinite
[2607.50s -> 2626.49s]  ad? Infinite ad. Watch it. Ow.
[2626.49s -> 2634.06s]  So is the stream... Was it in your sub boxes, guys?
[2634.06s -> 2647.75s]  I'm just wondering. Oh, that was sick.
[2647.75s -> 2657.82s]  Oh, lag. Because maybe that's another part of the problem.
[2657.82s -> 2663.98s]  I've had a couple people say that it's not. It wasn't in their subscription box.
[2663.98s -> 2670.65s]  Or it should have been. Oh, too many people attacking.
[2670.65s -> 2675.14s]  Oh, no. I don't know. I don't know what to do. Hold on. It is infinite
[2675.14s -> 2683.86s]  ads? Are you serious? Oh my god.
[2683.86s -> 2689.00s]  This is just a bug in the YouTube streaming. Definitely.
[2689.00s -> 2701.29s]  Infinite ads. Give me a break.
[2701.29s -> 2709.67s]  Just reload the stream. I have to reload the
[2709.67s -> 2719.80s]  stream. Yeah, if you're getting infinite ads, if you get stuck in
[2719.80s -> 2724.42s]  an infinite ad, just reload the stream. YouTube.com.
[2724.42s -> 2740.10s]  The best website in the world.
[2740.10s -> 2745.54s]  Anybody get by the train? Damn it.
[2745.54s -> 2749.54s]  I can't see him. He's the flames are blocking him.
[2749.54s -> 2766.82s]  Yeah, if you're getting infinite ads, definitely
[2766.82s -> 2770.82s]  just reload the stream. Or just come back. Because that's
[2770.82s -> 2775.00s]  stupid. That should absolutely not be happening.
[2775.00s -> 2780.01s]  Oh, add. Then add. Then add.
[2780.01s -> 2796.66s]  That's so dumb.
[2796.66s -> 2803.00s]  Oh, that medic is standing still.
[2803.00s -> 2807.00s]  I didn't kill the medic? What did I kill? That was weird.
[2807.00s -> 2816.81s]  Oh, god. Oh, god. No. Why?
[2816.81s -> 2832.36s]  Why? A wee by any car.
[2832.36s -> 2836.60s]  Who did I just kill? Can somebody in the
[2836.60s -> 2840.60s]  stream, right, that if you're getting like
[2840.60s -> 2844.60s]  just reload the browser, if you're getting an infinite ad, like two or three of you say it
[2844.60s -> 2848.60s]  because the chat is quite fast.
[2848.60s -> 2853.54s]  Because I wouldn't want someone just to sit there and be like, what is going on?
[2853.54s -> 2865.50s]  I got crits. Get that health.
[2865.50s -> 2877.54s]  No, no, no, no. Get out of the range. After this round I'm going to hop into some CSGO
[2877.54s -> 2888.42s]  for a little bit. Should be interesting.
[2888.42s -> 2894.46s]  All the things you're seeing are
[2894.46s -> 2898.63s]  YouTube streaming bugs apparently. None of this happened last time.
[2898.63s -> 2909.19s]  Those of you that were here last time, I don't think I can
[2909.19s -> 2913.19s]  restart the stream. That's the problem. The thing with YouTube is once you start
[2913.19s -> 2917.19s]  you have to either stop and like remake an event or
[2917.19s -> 2921.19s]  I think it's weird like that. I've got a critscreek right now.
[2921.19s -> 2937.38s]  Oh, my god. I killed one person.
[2937.38s -> 2941.38s]  Infinite ads. Oh, my god. Well, I guess the one
[2941.38s -> 2945.38s]  possibly good thing is this thing will be watchable on YouTube.
[2945.38s -> 2954.62s]  Hopefully, unless there's more bugs. When do I predict
[2954.62s -> 2958.62s]  Oh, he's going to fish kill me. No, he's going to fish kill me. He's going to fish kill me.
[2958.62s -> 2963.80s]  He fish killed me.
[2963.80s -> 2977.06s]  Alright, we'll go with three more deaths and I'm going to hop on CSGO.
[2977.06s -> 2981.43s]  I'll see if there's something I can do on my end. I don't think there is unless
[2981.43s -> 2985.43s]  I turn off the stream and then redo another live event.
[2985.43s -> 2989.67s]  It takes a little while to set these up on YouTube.
[2989.67s -> 2999.10s]  YouTube bugs for the win. Damn, if I only lowered that a little bit.
[2999.10s -> 3007.62s]  Where are they getting these crits?
[3007.62s -> 3015.75s]  No, that wasn't the medic. What was that? You're going to be
[3015.75s -> 3019.75s]  rolling that bacon, buddy. I don't think so. Maybe I'll get like banned.
[3019.75s -> 3023.75s]  They're probably going to be like, oh, we saw that you loaded 25,000
[3023.75s -> 3027.75s]  bats. You cheated. When in reality, it's just like a bug
[3027.75s -> 3036.15s]  on this site. Yeah, CSGO is the new
[3036.15s -> 3040.65s]  Counter Strike. It's in beta. Alright, this is my last life.
[3040.65s -> 3049.48s]  Last life and I'm going to hop on CSGO. Where am I going? Where is this guy going?
[3049.48s -> 3056.46s]  Oh, another one. Oh no, that didn't count. One more life.
[3056.46s -> 3060.46s]  YouTube premium. Only $30 a day.
[3060.46s -> 3065.40s]  $30 a day.
[3065.40s -> 3070.34s]  That's more money than my data plan for my phone is in a
[3070.34s -> 3081.22s]  whole month. Oh, I got him to kill himself.
[3081.22s -> 3085.91s]  First infinite ad, second...wow. YouTube.
[3085.91s -> 3090.54s]  Thank God for YouTube. And then not buggy site at all.
[3090.54s -> 3095.86s]  It works perfectly every single time you want to use it.
[3095.86s -> 3105.91s]  How did I not hit him? Oh, alright. CSGO time.
[3105.91s -> 3109.91s]  Alright, I'm going to disconnect from here. Hold on a
[3109.91s -> 3114.09s]  second. Let's figure this out. What the hell is going on? I'm going to...I'm playing my
[3114.09s -> 3121.90s]  own stream. Here we go. See what happens.
[3121.90s -> 3127.54s]  I'm watching...okay, here's an ad. Let's see what happens after this ad.
[3127.54s -> 3135.88s]  Alright, what do you got for me? You're going to give me like another ad? What do you
[3135.88s -> 3142.30s]  got? Oh, look! Another ad! Are you serious?
[3142.30s -> 3148.38s]  Wow. Alright.
[3148.38s -> 3155.43s]  Yeah, this is stupid. Oh my God, YouTube.
[3155.43s -> 3162.79s]  Oh, wait! It worked! Okay. I got two.
[3162.79s -> 3167.93s]  Oh, thank God for YouTube. Alright.
[3167.93s -> 3173.06s]  Can I like...hold on. Let me go to my video manager for a second.
[3173.06s -> 3179.99s]  I'm just going to turn off all the ads now. See if I can even do that.
[3179.99s -> 3185.77s]  Event dashboard. No, the stream is in good health.
[3185.77s -> 3195.69s]  Sure it is. Oh, sure it is. I don't understand.
[3195.69s -> 3199.69s]  See, there's like nothing...I have to turn off the stream.
[3199.69s -> 3209.74s]  Dumb. Alright, well, your stream is in good health.
[3209.74s -> 3219.46s]  Apparently not. Yeah, if you're still having the ad problem
[3219.46s -> 3223.46s]  or if you're just barely getting back from it, I apologize. That is not what was supposed
[3223.46s -> 3229.24s]  to be happening. Hold on a second. Yeah, see like the only thing I can do
[3229.24s -> 3233.24s]  is just like stop broadcasting. Which will turn off everything.
[3233.24s -> 3240.49s]  And then I have to like reset up a new event. Well, it should go
[3240.49s -> 3244.66s]  right to YouTube. This should be uploaded to YouTube without any BS.
[3244.66s -> 3255.74s]  So, I do apologize though. Let's go to
[3255.74s -> 3264.81s]  Counter-Strike Go. Oh, right.
[3264.81s -> 3272.42s]  The screen is going to go black while I load up Counter-Strike Go.
[3272.42s -> 3278.14s]  Counter-Strike Global Offensive. Hold on. Bear with me for
[3278.14s -> 3284.73s]  a second. Remove. Add. CS Go.
[3284.73s -> 3300.58s]  Okay. So, Counter-Strike
[3300.58s -> 3307.38s]  Go is all of a sudden 2,000 people quit the stream.
[3307.38s -> 3311.38s]  I wouldn't blame them, man. That's stupid. That's annoying. If I was just sitting there
[3311.38s -> 3315.38s]  wanting to watch a livestream and it was like, oh, here you go. Here's like 15 ads
[3315.38s -> 3319.88s]  right next to each other in a row. I'd be pissed off too. That's stupid.
[3319.88s -> 3326.10s]  How did I get a beta key? From a really
[3326.10s -> 3330.28s]  cool dude. His name, he just wants to, he wants to go by Anonymous.
[3330.28s -> 3334.28s]  If he's in the stream, if you're in the stream, Anonymous, then thank you so much. You are
[3334.28s -> 3343.18s]  amazing. Alright. It looks like we're on, what map are we even on?
[3343.18s -> 3349.06s]  I gotta buy stuff. Pistols, let's go with the
[3349.06s -> 3356.22s]  Deagle. Do I have enough money for that? I do.
[3356.22s -> 3366.98s]  Alright, let's do it. How much is CS Go? It's not out yet. I gotta turn,
[3366.98s -> 3373.34s]  my sensitivity is way too high on this. Gotta change that.
[3373.34s -> 3377.94s]  Oh, god. Oh, unsensitivity. Keyboard and mouse.
[3377.94s -> 3386.26s]  Mouse sensitivity, come down. There we go. Audio.
[3386.26s -> 3390.82s]  Bring the audio down. Resume.
[3390.82s -> 3400.87s]  Alright, we lost. Alright, that's much better. Dual Berettas, baby.
[3400.87s -> 3410.62s]  I need to start saving money. What am I doing?
[3410.62s -> 3421.30s]  Click, click. D-Dust is dustier.
[3421.30s -> 3425.30s]  It's alright, I just unloaded a clip on you. Whoa, they take a long time
[3425.30s -> 3434.78s]  to reload. These things take a long time to reload. Bang.
[3434.78s -> 3442.31s]  Bang. I actually like these. I'm gonna keep
[3442.31s -> 3447.58s]  these. Let's get a, how much money do I have? Kevlar and helmet.
[3447.58s -> 3475.80s]  I'm gonna stick with these. I'm good with these.
[3475.80s -> 3485.85s]  Long range pistol attack. Let's get up there. Oh, god.
[3485.85s -> 3490.60s]  What am I doing? What did I just pick up? I didn't want that. What was up with that?
[3490.60s -> 3498.66s]  I didn't want to pick up that weapon. That was BS.
[3498.66s -> 3503.29s]  Is that the P90? Or the PPM, whatever it is? Let's watch this guy.
[3503.29s -> 3507.29s]  Let's see how good this guy is. Oh, you just got smashed.
[3507.29s -> 3517.85s]  You just got smashed. I think this is coming out in
[3517.85s -> 3522.15s]  a couple months maybe? I don't know. There's no release date for it yet. It's in beta.
[3522.15s -> 3532.76s]  Let's go PP. Check the PP out.
[3532.76s -> 3536.76s]  If I get one car for free, I would want the most expensive car you could ever bake.
[3536.76s -> 3540.76s]  I would want like a Lamborghini or like a Bentley. Give me like the
[3540.76s -> 3544.76s]  absolute most expensive car you can buy and then like, then I'll just resell it.
[3544.76s -> 3550.15s]  Oh, drop zone. Damn. I got one guy. I got
[3550.15s -> 3557.02s]  one guy.
[3557.02s -> 3564.50s]  Abyss Lord.
[3564.50s -> 3570.79s]  Am I like, what's going on? Why is this guy just like sitting here? Is this guy camping with a
[3570.79s -> 3578.66s]  deagle? How you get a copy of this isn't it?
[3578.66s -> 3582.66s]  You have to go to, you have to take Valve's survey.
[3582.66s -> 3589.14s]  They have like a CSGO survey. Oh, the FAMAS and
[3589.14s -> 3595.37s]  Kevlar and Hellman. I've been invited to join the group. Kills free gaming.
[3595.37s -> 3601.40s]  So is this a burst? This is a lot different than it is in Call of Duty, I'm assuming.
[3601.40s -> 3613.70s]  Where is this guy? He's down there. Oh, no.
[3613.70s -> 3622.52s]  No, no, no, no. Run away. Ah, I almost got that guy.
[3622.52s -> 3627.78s]  He's right there. Ah, damn it.
[3627.78s -> 3632.73s]  Boston's good. Boston is good. I like it.
[3632.73s -> 3639.90s]  It's kind of cold out here now though. The survey is
[3639.90s -> 3643.90s]  if you just type into Google, type in like Conner Strike
[3643.90s -> 3647.90s]  Go Beta Survey. I'm sure it'll come up. It'll be on a Valve website or Conner Strike
[3647.90s -> 3653.67s]  website. I think you can do it through Steam as well.
[3653.67s -> 3657.91s]  Maybe they aren't even doing it anymore. I'm not sure if anybody knows.
[3657.91s -> 3664.44s]  Where is the, is it the MP7? The one from
[3664.44s -> 3668.44s]  Conner Strike, the original, that I like? I think it might be. I forget.
[3668.44s -> 3680.87s]  Oh yeah, they're not even close. Two totally different games. I'm gonna go this way.
[3680.87s -> 3688.81s]  I had more luck going this way before. Oh lord.
[3688.81s -> 3699.11s]  I'm gonna get flashed. I am gonna get flashed.
[3699.11s -> 3706.68s]  Damn, how did I not get that guy? Come on, that's ridiculous.
[3706.68s -> 3710.68s]  That is redonkulous. I'm gonna turn my
[3710.68s -> 3714.68s]  heat seeking missile thing up, or black screen for a second.
[3714.68s -> 3722.42s]  Resume game. The beta ends probably when the game comes out.
[3722.42s -> 3729.98s]  A scout asks for a dispenser. Will you give him one?
[3729.98s -> 3733.98s]  Actually the questions were kind of weird. It was like,
[3733.98s -> 3738.22s]  let me ask you something. What does more damage in a round? The M4A1
[3738.22s -> 3742.22s]  or the AK-47? Which one do you think is more powerful?
[3742.22s -> 3746.22s]  They ask you like actual real questions about it, so. That's not how
[3746.22s -> 3751.86s]  I got into it though. I got, somebody gave me a beta key. I'm gonna go, let's go Terracid.
[3751.86s -> 3759.18s]  Would I buy a Ferrari? If I had the money
[3759.18s -> 3764.38s]  like to just throw away, I absolutely would. Go to
[3764.38s -> 3775.77s]  Berettas. Oh! Yeah, I need to buy a frag.
[3775.77s -> 3785.69s]  What am I doing? I'm like not buying anything. Oh, they're behind us too.
[3785.69s -> 3790.70s]  Yikes! I'm gonna go around this way. I'm gonna surprise this bastard.
[3790.70s -> 3795.94s]  Can I even go around this way? I don't think so. I would love
[3795.94s -> 3809.72s]  to hear a joke. Who the hell is everybody? There's only two guys left on the team. There's one.
[3809.72s -> 3815.30s]  Oh! I just totally gave myself away.
[3815.30s -> 3821.14s]  Oh my god, what an idiot I am. I'm so
[3821.14s -> 3829.35s]  stupid. Firing around in the air with dual pistols equals
[3829.35s -> 3834.36s]  MLG Pro. Yeah, I wanna buy, I wanna get a rifleman.
[3834.36s -> 3840.81s]  Oh, that guy. That guy's unloaded. Oh, you're taking
[3840.81s -> 3846.97s]  the survey now? Good, good. I love potatoes. They are unbelievable.
[3846.97s -> 3853.88s]  Alright, let me get a, what do we got for heavy?
[3853.88s -> 3860.73s]  Lenovo. This thing is 5200 bucks, oh my god.
[3860.73s -> 3864.90s]  The Galil, okay. We'll take out the Galil. Nah, I want a grenade.
[3864.90s -> 3869.08s]  I want a Molotov. We're doing Molotov right now. How do I
[3869.08s -> 3873.08s]  switch to it? Is it, what is it, three? Oh, it's four. Okay, four.
[3873.08s -> 3881.46s]  I'm gonna throw it down the hall. Let's throw this down here.
[3881.46s -> 3886.26s]  Molotov out!
[3886.26s -> 3892.02s]  Whoops. Hey, oh, sorry, I just like totally ruined everything, teammate.
[3892.02s -> 3898.06s]  I apologize for that. I thought there was a guy right there next to him. Oh my
[3898.06s -> 3905.93s]  god. Oh my god, no. Ah, huh.
[3905.93s -> 3915.10s]  Mr. Cammie, I'll say your name. Counter-terrorists win.
[3915.10s -> 3924.44s]  I lost all my money. Hmm. I want something with
[3924.44s -> 3929.13s]  like a, this thing's got the highest fire rate, huh? None of these are that accurate.
[3929.13s -> 3935.14s]  This thing, oh, it's a sniper. Oh, the AWP is
[3935.14s -> 3945.08s]  back. I'll go with the Galil. I like the Galil.
[3945.08s -> 3950.54s]  I need some more money. I gotta start killing people. Not like running around like an idiot.
[3950.54s -> 3958.68s]  Alright, this is where the action is. Oh my,
[3958.68s -> 3964.26s]  oh, I knew it. Why did I go around so carelessly?
[3964.26s -> 3968.26s]  If I had a frag grenade or if I had a Molotov, that would have been game over.
[3968.26s -> 3978.57s]  Super Taco, well, I'm glad to be your hero. If there's
[3978.57s -> 3982.57s]  anything I can do to protect this country and this world, I will do it.
[3982.57s -> 3992.62s]  This guy is, this guy is so dead.
[3992.62s -> 3997.18s]  He had the right idea right there.
[3997.18s -> 4003.32s]  Leprechauns. Oh, come on, pull it off. Oh!
[4003.32s -> 4010.34s]  Oh, damn. Look at that.
[4010.34s -> 4016.82s]  He ended up, he pulled it off. I bet you I will see that comment, TheAwesome.
[4016.82s -> 4024.25s]  I bet you I will. Alright, I want to go, I don't want the
[4024.25s -> 4032.42s]  shotgun. Let's go with the 5.7. Kelvlar
[4032.42s -> 4038.14s]  and I want high explosive grenade.
[4038.14s -> 4046.58s]  Alright, I'm not messing around anymore here. Read the word
[4046.58s -> 4051.40s]  in Arabic? What word are you talking about? Alright, this is the
[4051.40s -> 4057.18s]  magic, magic area. Boom, get blown.
[4057.18s -> 4069.24s]  Damn, don't breathe in. Damn.
[4069.24s -> 4073.24s]  Reflex just like a cat, baby. I'll take your, I'll take your
[4073.24s -> 4079.32s]  PM290, whatever it is. Ah! Every time I start
[4079.32s -> 4084.14s]  talking, I'm like, I just get annihilated.
[4084.14s -> 4088.70s]  Alright, I'm definitely buying that again. Cause that's like, I did good with that.
[4088.70s -> 4096.70s]  And I want, I'll take a flashbang. You can buy more than
[4096.70s -> 4102.73s]  one grenade, I think. I don't know why I'm only buying one or two. Be
[4102.73s -> 4107.22s]  prepared. What's that from? 15 German
[4107.22s -> 4111.22s]  points, what's that from? Be prepared.
[4111.22s -> 4119.03s]  Get flashed. I just flashed myself.
[4119.03s -> 4123.03s]  Oh,
[4123.03s -> 4129.26s]  what an imbecile. I'll take you down too, where are you at, buddy?
[4129.26s -> 4134.89s]  Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[4134.89s -> 4141.10s]  MLG Glock. I like this gun.
[4141.10s -> 4147.90s]  I need to start to stop being a turd and like, do well.
[4147.90s -> 4153.48s]  And grenades. I'm gonna go with another Molotov and a high explosive
[4153.48s -> 4158.04s]  grenade. I'm gonna have two different grenades. We'll go with the Molotov
[4158.04s -> 4164.33s]  first. That's right, Lion King. Lion King, you all get it.
[4164.33s -> 4169.90s]  Molotov, baby, what do you say? Let's light it up.
[4169.90s -> 4173.90s]  Light it up, baby. What just happened? Oh god, oh my god, no.
[4173.90s -> 4177.90s]  No. Oh god, this guy's so mad.
[4177.90s -> 4181.90s]  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
[4181.90s -> 4185.90s]  I'm so sorry. I just killed all my teammates. Oh my god.
[4195.86s -> 4203.67s]  Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[4203.67s -> 4208.04s]  This guy is so mad. I have my voice turned off.
[4208.04s -> 4212.04s]  But that guy was definitely screaming at me.
[4212.04s -> 4221.08s]  I can guarantee you that. Is this a scope?
[4221.08s -> 4229.59s]  It is. Ooh, I think I might like this thing.
[4229.59s -> 4236.90s]  Alright, this time I'm not gonna flashbang myself.
[4236.90s -> 4246.62s]  Oh, for the love of god. Damn.
[4246.62s -> 4251.50s]  Be prepared. Jerma, why was there fruit punch on the floor?
[4251.50s -> 4255.50s]  I don't know. People need to stop eating so much fruit punch.
[4255.50s -> 4260.31s]  Well, that guy just totally, this guy Killroy just killed the entire team.
[4260.31s -> 4267.29s]  He legit just killed every single person. I gotta start using
[4267.29s -> 4271.29s]  the SMGs. I am absolutely not one of those guys that can sit
[4271.29s -> 4275.29s]  back and do well by aiming. I just need to go like this.
[4279.29s -> 4283.29s]  Oh, shit. This guy is so, oh, he's a bot.
[4283.29s -> 4289.05s]  Okay, nevermind, he's a bot. And these are all bots?
[4289.05s -> 4297.96s]  How come my team has the bots? Alright, let's go. Spray and pray, baby.
[4297.96s -> 4312.74s]  Oh my god, how much does it take to kill the guy? What just happened?
[4312.74s -> 4319.14s]  Where was that guy? What in the name of god?
[4319.14s -> 4327.32s]  I can, can I really? That's pretty cool.
[4327.32s -> 4331.75s]  Alright, I'm just, I'm going with just straight up, I want money. Should I? I got money.
[4331.75s -> 4338.01s]  What about the shotgun? I'm gonna use the shotgun. Just because
[4338.01s -> 4342.95s]  I feel like it. I did play CS Source. I played 1.6.
[4342.95s -> 4348.09s]  I wasn't really that good at it though. My brother was really good.
[4348.09s -> 4352.09s]  My older brother was really good at Counter-Strike.
[4352.09s -> 4359.85s]  Me, not so much. Let me get somebody to just play.
[4359.85s -> 4364.52s]  I was trolling for a headshot.
[4364.52s -> 4371.11s]  Damn it. That guy's good.
[4371.11s -> 4377.45s]  It's not fair. That guy's like too good at this game. I was using the shotgun.
[4377.45s -> 4385.77s]  That guy killed Roy. I want to get on his team.
[4385.77s -> 4389.77s]  I'm 4 and 9 right now. How, wow, I'm doing the best
[4389.77s -> 4394.57s]  on this team? No way. I want to, what's the most expensive
[4394.57s -> 4399.69s]  one? MP7. And grenades.
[4399.69s -> 4404.95s]  High explosive grenade. And I want a Molotov. Can you put a silencer
[4404.95s -> 4410.86s]  on stuff too? Isn't that possible? Alright, this time I'm not going to light
[4410.86s -> 4418.49s]  the entire team on fire. I promise. I have played some MMOs. I played
[4418.49s -> 4423.50s]  World of Warcraft for so long.
[4423.50s -> 4427.50s]  How am I, I can't believe I didn't kill that guy. That headshot of me.
[4427.50s -> 4431.50s]  How did I not land one shot on him? That is
[4431.50s -> 4436.63s]  ridiculous in my opinion. Ridiculous.
[4436.63s -> 4442.02s]  Unless he's like aimbotting. No, he's definitely not.
[4442.02s -> 4452.46s]  He's just really good. I'm 4 and 10. Oh, if you die
[4452.46s -> 4456.82s]  one more time, you need to eat an egg.
[4456.82s -> 4460.82s]  I had the most success, to be totally honest, with the
[4460.82s -> 4466.09s]  5.7. Kevlar. Forget about the stupid
[4466.09s -> 4471.54s]  grenades. One Molotov. Let's go. I've
[4471.54s -> 4482.44s]  only killed people with this weapon. Alright, let's get some area denial down there.
[4482.44s -> 4491.34s]  I didn't want this. I didn't want this. I didn't want
[4491.34s -> 4495.34s]  that weapon. Dude, this guy Kilroy, seriously, is just like
[4495.34s -> 4503.22s]  destroying everybody. Kilroy.
[4503.22s -> 4508.81s]  Look at my team and look at their team. Look at how many pros
[4508.81s -> 4512.81s]  are on their team. Look at how many scrubs are on my team, including me.
[4512.81s -> 4519.66s]  You've got the ultimate scrub, which is me. And then like two of those guys
[4519.66s -> 4523.66s]  are like 8 and 2 KDR.
[4523.66s -> 4533.08s]  Alright, I'll definitely do that next time, CN. I'll take control
[4533.08s -> 4538.86s]  of one of these bot bastards. Oh god.
[4538.86s -> 4549.82s]  Hey, white screen. Watch out, watch out. Get out of my way.
[4549.82s -> 4555.96s]  I'm so dead. I'm going this way.
[4555.96s -> 4565.29s]  Wow, we won. Cool. I shot like five people.
[4565.29s -> 4571.64s]  An awesome pro 360 controller user.
[4571.64s -> 4578.23s]  I already got the Glock. No, the
[4578.23s -> 4583.43s]  R7, sorry. Let's do it. Oh, max
[4583.43s -> 4596.49s]  out the pistol ammo. Okay, let's go.
[4596.49s -> 4603.74s]  There's going to be somebody right here and I'm going to get frigging headshotted.
[4603.74s -> 4608.42s]  And right here. That Kilroy, god damn it, headshot.
[4608.42s -> 4612.66s]  Range quit. I'm going in a different lobby.
[4612.66s -> 4618.06s]  I'm going somewhere else. Watch me get put right into the same game.
[4618.06s -> 4623.64s]  Oh, let's go right into the same game with freaking
[4623.64s -> 4627.64s]  Kilroy, the guy with 40 kills and like three deaths.
[4627.64s -> 4637.05s]  Yeah, I'm going to get my first Moab in this game.
[4637.05s -> 4645.70s]  Why am I not making commentaries about CS? I just got it.
[4645.70s -> 4652.18s]  I just got it. I got CS go
[4652.18s -> 4657.00s]  probably three or four days ago. Alright, good. Good. This is a
[4657.00s -> 4661.30s]  new lobby. Oh, new map too. Very cool.
[4661.30s -> 4674.04s]  New map. No, this is Italy, right? This is CS Italy.
[4674.04s -> 4678.34s]  Hi, Mexican Koala. How are you? Good to see you.
[4678.34s -> 4690.55s]  Need backup. I'm going this way. There we go.
[4690.55s -> 4696.20s]  Let's clear this place out, gentlemen. Well, that's how you
[4696.20s -> 4702.41s]  win. That's how you win. Alright, I got one.
[4702.41s -> 4712.47s]  That's 24 away from a Moab.
[4712.47s -> 4716.47s]  Yeah, I don't know when the TF2 update is going to come out, to be honest. I'm not sure.
[4716.47s -> 4720.97s]  They've already started rolling out some changes, so probably in the
[4720.97s -> 4725.46s]  near future. I'd say in the next, probably in the next couple weeks
[4725.46s -> 4730.60s]  you'll probably see some more stuff in TF2. Hopefully, at least.
[4730.60s -> 4734.60s]  There's going to be a bunch of people around this corner. Oh, right there. This guy.
[4734.60s -> 4740.63s]  If only my reactions were better and I didn't think
[4740.63s -> 4746.65s]  that was a teammate. I use a Razor Death Adder.
[4746.65s -> 4751.59s]  That's the mouse I use. Oh, take control of the bot. Oh, hey,
[4751.59s -> 4759.98s]  what's up, hostages? Oh, no.
[4759.98s -> 4767.42s]  I got the hostages. What do we do?
[4767.42s -> 4773.19s]  Those poor hostages. Oh, apparently my stream is
[4773.19s -> 4780.89s]  just starting. That makes perfect sense. Oh, get away from me.
[4780.89s -> 4788.25s]  I got one. Oh, my God. Look at all this fruit punch.
[4788.25s -> 4793.18s]  Something happened here. He's right there. He's right
[4793.18s -> 4803.72s]  there. Oh, Wayne.
[4803.72s -> 4808.66s]  We lost. Oh, that's right. I got my kills when I took control of
[4808.66s -> 4814.42s]  bots. Whoops. Oh, we're going to do some sniping.
[4814.42s -> 4821.03s]  We're going to do some straight up legit sniping. Oh, yeah, this is going to be
[4821.03s -> 4830.38s]  sick. Hell, yeah. Why did the chicken cross the road?
[4830.38s -> 4834.74s]  To go meet his family for supper.
[4834.74s -> 4852.90s]  Oh, bastard. How am I not hitting you?
[4852.90s -> 4859.90s]  Oh, quick scope. What? What? I was going to say,
[4859.90s -> 4866.31s]  how did I miss that? That was going to be like, oh, I just die.
[4866.31s -> 4870.31s]  I go walk up five feet away from you. Actually, this guy over here.
[4870.31s -> 4882.22s]  Where is he? Oh, get
[4882.22s -> 4887.67s]  get dominated. Anybody else? There's two more
[4887.67s -> 4892.86s]  guys. No, no,
[4892.86s -> 4901.30s]  no, no, no. Shoot. Come on, come around the corner.
[4901.30s -> 4909.30s]  Where's he going? That scares me. Where'd he go? Where is
[4909.30s -> 4917.24s]  that dude? Where the hell is he? Oh, it's what?
[4917.24s -> 4924.22s]  What the hell was going on? He was just sitting there?
[4924.22s -> 4933.30s]  You bot. All right, we'll do another two or three
[4933.30s -> 4941.62s]  rounds. I want to buy... Let's go with
[4941.62s -> 4946.68s]  the PP. And I didn't buy the Kevlar. What am I thinking?
[4946.68s -> 4957.82s]  Kevlar best. Oh, look at that fire rate.
[4957.82s -> 4961.82s]  To get a MOAB, I got to kill more than like one person in a row.
[4961.82s -> 4971.54s]  Two of them. Two of them. That's ridiculous.
[4971.54s -> 4975.91s]  I can't believe I didn't kill him. That's ridiculous.
[4975.91s -> 4980.28s]  I got a GTX 470 from a video. That's the video card I got.
[4980.28s -> 4988.39s]  Desert Eagle. Kevlar and helmet.
[4988.39s -> 4994.74s]  And a high explosive. Oh, yeah. All right, this
[4994.74s -> 4998.74s]  probably would be the last round before I end the stream, because I want to go back and look and see
[4998.74s -> 5002.92s]  what was going on. See what kind of errors were happening. This will be
[5002.92s -> 5006.92s]  on YouTube if you just came, if you missed the beginning.
[5006.92s -> 5013.83s]  Oh, give me the whole line of people.
[5013.83s -> 5017.83s]  Oh my god. I didn't kill the whole line. I just killed like four people right there.
[5017.83s -> 5025.38s]  Oh, look at that. Ammo conservation. I was just
[5025.38s -> 5029.38s]  aiming down there, aiming near heads, and I just killed everybody. But yeah, this is going to be
[5029.38s -> 5033.38s]  uploaded to YouTube, so if you missed it, or if you couldn't watch
[5033.38s -> 5037.38s]  it or something like that, this will be in your sub box as a watchable
[5037.38s -> 5049.03s]  just straight through video. At least I hope it will. Have I
[5049.03s -> 5055.70s]  used this gun yet? I don't know. I'm going to go up here. I'm going to go up the log
[5055.70s -> 5067.18s]  cabin. Oh, never mind. No, I'm not. It's too much work to do.
[5067.18s -> 5071.18s]  This guy stopped talking? Listen to me. He's like, got another flare,
[5071.18s -> 5075.18s]  hostages situation. Got it. Yep. Roger.
[5075.18s -> 5082.60s]  Oh my. I don't even know how that, I don't even know how
[5082.60s -> 5087.66s]  that happened. I don't even know how that happened. I want to watch
[5087.66s -> 5092.28s]  that again, because I had a Kevlar...
[5092.28s -> 5099.26s]  I don't understand. I don't get it. I'll take control of you,
[5099.26s -> 5103.86s]  buddy. Alright. Alright, hostages.
[5103.86s -> 5107.86s]  Let's talk business. What do you know about the operation?
[5107.86s -> 5111.86s]  Too late, you didn't answer fast enough. What about you?
[5111.86s -> 5115.86s]  You like seeing your friend get shot like that? What do you know about the organization X?
[5115.86s -> 5119.86s]  Oh, I don't know. I'm so scared, please just let me get... That's not the
[5119.86s -> 5127.37s]  right answer. Oh, they rescued them.
[5127.37s -> 5132.25s]  It's alright.
[5132.25s -> 5137.56s]  Don't ask me
[5137.56s -> 5145.37s]  how that happened. I don't understand. I don't understand.
[5145.37s -> 5149.37s]  Oh, this is the Og. I didn't even see this. I used to love
[5149.37s -> 5158.66s]  the Og. The Og. A-U-G.
[5158.66s -> 5176.46s]  The Oggy. Come on, show yourself. Another here.
[5176.46s -> 5182.81s]  Get out of my way. Get out of here.
[5182.81s -> 5187.24s]  What am I doing? What are you doing? You're a bot. You listen to me.
[5187.24s -> 5194.42s]  I can't kill him.
[5194.42s -> 5201.86s]  Oh, look. I'm going to be the only one left. What's going on, random vids?
[5201.86s -> 5208.66s]  I was going to shoot the chicken. I was going to shoot the chicken.
[5208.66s -> 5216.42s]  How come these are all just bots? I just went to quick
[5216.42s -> 5221.82s]  match. It's not like I said, please play with bots only.
[5221.82s -> 5230.71s]  I just went into quick match. I don't understand.
[5230.71s -> 5235.38s]  I kind of want to just die. Ready? Oh, this is going to be funny.
[5235.38s -> 5241.22s]  Do any of those guys have grenades?
[5241.22s -> 5245.85s]  I hope they do. I just went so high.
[5245.85s -> 5251.24s]  Alright, let's see. I want this guy. Where are the hostages?
[5251.24s -> 5262.18s]  Where are the hostages? Oh my god, the entire team is right
[5262.18s -> 5268.02s]  there.
[5268.02s -> 5272.02s]  Come on. Ah, damn it. Alright, guys.
[5272.02s -> 5276.90s]  That's enough for me. See, watch. Ready? Exit to main menu. I went to
[5276.90s -> 5280.90s]  quick match. Did I do quick match or create a game? I think I just did quick match.
[5280.90s -> 5285.90s]  I don't know. But yeah.
[5285.90s -> 5290.39s]  Thanks everybody for coming. If you missed it or if you
[5290.39s -> 5294.39s]  were having problems with the stream earlier, this should all be uploaded to
[5294.39s -> 5298.39s]  YouTube so you can watch the whole stream if you want from beginning to end.
[5298.39s -> 5302.76s]  Thank you guys for watching. And I do apologize. I'm sorry for
[5302.76s -> 5307.13s]  the shenanigans that happened earlier.
[5307.13s -> 5311.13s]  I don't even know what was happening. Everyone was getting like 50 ads in a row.
[5311.13s -> 5315.13s]  That's not how it was set up. I apologize if you were having
[5315.13s -> 5319.13s]  problems. But yeah, thank you guys so much. I'll talk to you guys soon.
[5319.13s -> 5323.43s]  And take care everybody. Next stream is going to be next
[5323.43s -> 5327.80s]  Saturday probably. Or, you know, I might do one during the week. I'm not sure yet.
[5327.80s -> 5332.47s]  I don't know. I'm not sure. I assume
[5332.47s -> 5336.47s]  that I'll probably do one, if not this coming Saturday at six,
[5336.47s -> 5341.10s]  then probably like Thursday
[5341.10s -> 5349.56s]  or Wednesday, something like that, if I end up doing a midweek one. But I will check you
[5349.56s -> 5353.56s]  guys soon. Thank you everybody. Goodbye. See ya.
[5353.56s -> 5359.00s]  Actually, how do I turn it off? I don't even know how to
[5359.00s -> 5364.46s]  turn off my YouTube stream. Hold on.
[5364.46s -> 5369.34s]  I can't stop streaming.
[5369.34s -> 5374.41s]  Oh, let me just go to YouTube.com. What if it was just locked forever?
[5374.41s -> 5378.41s]  Like, oh sorry, you're stuck on YouTube for the rest of your life.
[5378.41s -> 5384.23s]  What is going on? Why can't I? Oh, I gotta open up a new tab.
[5384.23s -> 5392.60s]  Here we go. Okay. Here we go. There it is.
[5392.60s -> 5396.60s]  Alright, yep. Thank you guys. See you soon. Take care everybody.
