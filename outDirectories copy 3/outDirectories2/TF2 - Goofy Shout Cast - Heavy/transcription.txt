[3.45s -> 15.58s]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is Anthony Wimbleton coming at you with a first shoutcast on German 95's channel.
[15.58s -> 18.58s]  Never done a shoutcast before, but that's okay, we're gonna change that right now.
[18.58s -> 25.58s]  Coming at you with a heavy gameplay. Rocket at new school with the gloves of running urgently, the family business, and the Tommy Slav.
[25.58s -> 30.58s]  Germa is in a really, really crazy mood right now. He's gonna try and do a shoutcast for the first time. He's gonna do it right now as a heavy...
[30.58s -> 31.58s]  Here we go!
[31.58s -> 36.58s]  Spy coming around the corner trying to get a backstab on somebody, maybe snap the sentry as well, but Germa does not let that happen.
[36.58s -> 41.58s]  Jumps around the corner with the Tommy Slav and starts unloading a massive amount of damage on everybody that's coming up to the side here.
[41.58s -> 44.58s]  A lot of things going on right now, a lot of chaos, a lot of damage going on.
[44.58s -> 48.58s]  Sentry looks like it might be going down, but that's not a concern to Germa because he's not an engineer.
[48.58s -> 51.58s]  Pyro kinda hides around the corner trying to find a way to get somebody with a spray.
[51.58s -> 55.58s]  Germa backs off for a second with his Chinese or Japanese friend that's a medic.
[55.58s -> 57.58s]  Not really sure too much about that right now, but I'll get back to that in a minute.
[57.58s -> 63.58s]  Germa right now hogging the cart like it's one of his favorite toys when he was five years old, trying to find a way to stop this team from pushing all the way to the middle here.
[64.58s -> 69.58s]  Spy gets back out here, tries to get the sap on the engineer, but he gets the stab actually, and he does not get the sap.
[69.58s -> 74.88s]  Unfortunately though, these two dispensers are going to go down, which is going to stop our team from healing a lot.
[74.88s -> 77.88s]  Look at this Pyro spraying into nowhere, and here comes the first Uber of the game.
[77.88s -> 81.88s]  Germa comes around the corner here, loses the medic for the first time, but he finds a way to get to the medic again.
[81.88s -> 85.88s]  Absolute perfect push here, got a Spy on the side here, trying to get a backstab on one of our teammates.
[85.88s -> 90.88s]  He does not get the stab, instead he goes down, down to Chinatown, whipping off the gloves of running urgently,
[90.88s -> 94.88s]  and he sees an opportunity to get this engineer in his building, but now he's kind of hiding on the right side of the bridge,
[94.88s -> 97.88s]  and he gets this engineer and this Pyro and that Demoman.
[97.88s -> 99.88s]  I did not say engineer, I meant to say Demoman, I'm sorry about that.
[99.88s -> 104.88s]  Red Engineer now has the teleporter built up to level two, I believe, so now our team can come right back into the front lines when they die.
[104.88s -> 109.88s]  Medic goes down, I believe he had about 25% Uber, which is a good thing, because now he cannot charge that on a teammate.
[109.88s -> 116.88s]  Soldier gets around, and Germa realizes this, so he swiftly and methodically goes over into the courtyard area and towards this house into the building.
[116.88s -> 121.88s]  He finds that there is a Soldier and a Demoman and a Pyro here, ready to be shot, but he doesn't want to get himself killed,
[121.88s -> 124.88s]  so he walks out of the back door trying to find his Medic friend.
[124.88s -> 128.88s]  Turns around and sees that the Medic is obviously preoccupied with something else, so instead of saying over voice chat,
[128.88s -> 130.88s]  hey can you heal me? He just turns around and goes the other way like an idiot.
[130.88s -> 134.88s]  Picks up this health pack on the ground here, and he knows that there's another health pack over on this side as well, near the engineer.
[134.88s -> 137.88s]  Doesn't want to take the ammo, because he doesn't want to be a jerk and take the metal from the engineer,
[137.88s -> 140.88s]  so he comes out here with a shotgun, shooting a few times into this Demoman's face.
[140.88s -> 143.88s]  Gets the final kill right there on that Demoman, and now they're trying to back up,
[143.88s -> 147.88s]  trying not to get themselves killed, because Jerma knows that this could be very, very detrimental to his health.
[147.88s -> 150.88s]  So he turns the corner, Crit Rocket gets him right in the body, and he tries to find a way backwards,
[150.88s -> 153.88s]  because he doesn't want to get himself killed. That Crit Rocket really shook him.
[153.88s -> 157.12s]  Nerves are high right now, nerves are skyrocketing.
[157.12s -> 161.12s]  Blue Team is inches from the cart being capped. Inches, I mean absolute inches.
[161.12s -> 165.12s]  Jerma coming around the corner, this Soldier is still on the cart, they need to find a way to do this.
[165.12s -> 168.12s]  Another Heavy coming around to support Jerma and his Medic.
[168.12s -> 171.12s]  The cart is getting closer to completion, Demoman is right here,
[171.12s -> 174.12s]  Demoman is going to try and cap the point, Soldier is on the point, Pyro coming around the side here,
[174.12s -> 177.12s]  Jerma just gets barely the kill on him, Medic goes down.
[177.12s -> 181.12s]  Now the cart is simply inches away from being capped, Jerma trying to think of a solution.
[181.12s -> 185.12s]  There just is none at this point, he's going to come around here trying to get this done himself.
[185.12s -> 188.12s]  Here comes the Cavalry, Jerma comes around here, Uber is right at the right particular moment,
[188.12s -> 192.12s]  he gets a great Uber charge, absolute fantastic placement.
[192.12s -> 195.12s]  Turns out to be quite a bad idea though, because as you will see, he gets quite a few kills,
[195.12s -> 198.12s]  but that doesn't matter because take a look at the bottom of your screen,
[198.12s -> 202.12s]  the cart is inches away from being capped, the dreaded Soldier is now getting onto the cart,
[202.12s -> 205.12s]  take a look down at the bottom, it's going to be a close one guys, here it comes,
[205.12s -> 208.12s]  here comes the Soldier, what's going to happen, is he going to cap the cart?
[208.12s -> 213.12s]  He caps the cart, oh my goodness gracious, what an absolutely insane turn of events right there for the Red Team.
[213.12s -> 216.12s]  Absolutely depressing, crushing defeat right there,
[216.12s -> 219.12s]  Jerma is probably going to go listen to one of his favorite emo songs and cry himself to sleep tonight,
[219.12s -> 223.12s]  but we've got more important things to talk about like the cart coming through the corner.
[223.12s -> 227.92s]  This is the part where they, this is where they charge an Uber for a second, I guess.
[227.92s -> 231.80s]  Anyways, coming around here, Jerma sees a Soldier on the top right,
[231.80s -> 235.80s]  two medics healing him at this point right now, two medics count him, one and two.
[235.80s -> 239.80s]  Focusing right now on complete and total area denial, this is a great strategy,
[239.80s -> 243.80s]  especially a double-heeled Heavy that's impossible to get by, no chance in hell or in heaven to get by him.
[243.80s -> 247.80s]  Uber charge is almost at 95%, pretty much getting close to completion,
[247.80s -> 250.80s]  he's going to try and do something, try to make something happen, pulls out the gloves and running urgently,
[250.80s -> 252.80s]  here we go, pop the Uber baby!
[252.80s -> 255.80s]  Jerma comes around here, gets the first Demoman with a shot in his mouth,
[255.80s -> 259.80s]  second Demoman has no chance in hell, third Demoman is right around the corner here,
[259.80s -> 262.80s]  Jerma lights him up full of lead and then there's a Spy too, what's going to happen?
[262.80s -> 264.80s]  Is this Spy going to be able to backstab any of these people?
[264.80s -> 266.80s]  Potentially yes, because he got away, unfortunately.
[266.80s -> 269.80s]  Jerma and his medic are now in very dire straits right now, behind the cart,
[269.80s -> 272.80s]  no teammates to back them up, no one to secure their position,
[272.80s -> 274.80s]  and now the Spy is getting away again.
[274.80s -> 277.80s]  Here comes a Soldier, oh my goodness gracious, is the medic going to go down?
[277.80s -> 280.80s]  Can he get the final shots on that Soldier? He cannot!
[280.80s -> 283.80s]  The Soldier is still spamming another Soldier now, the medic is going to go down,
[283.80s -> 288.80s]  Jerma has nowhere to go, the medic is now down and now Jerma comes out here, kills both the Soldiers!
[288.80s -> 294.80s]  Unbelievable performance, I can't believe it, and he just barely gets to hell too, unprecedented.
[294.80s -> 302.56s]  I hope you guys enjoyed this video, it took a little while to do this,
[302.56s -> 306.93s]  so thank you so much for watching, I get backstabbed right here in a second,
[306.93s -> 310.17s]  so I come around this corner, I get around to the side here,
[310.17s -> 313.17s]  but thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time,
[313.17s -> 315.17s]  and I hope you enjoyed this, take care everybody.
