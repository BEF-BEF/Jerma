[0.63s -> 6.83s]  Yo, yo, yo, what's up everybody? Jerma here with another Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[6.83s -> 9.44s]  Like you know it everybody.
[9.44s -> 12.74s]  Today I'm gonna be playing as the Tomislav Heavy.
[12.74s -> 17.54s]  Something I haven't done in a long time. I haven't played Heavy in a very long time.
[17.54s -> 20.71s]  But Tomislav Heavy is very fun, very interesting.
[20.71s -> 23.41s]  They didn't nerf it. It was supposed to get nerfed.
[23.41s -> 27.32s]  Minus 50 health, I think it was, if you equip this item.
[27.32s -> 31.52s]  If you guys are in the beta, if somebody's in the beta, let me know if they're still testing this.
[31.52s -> 36.22s]  Because that's a pretty huge deal. So if they're still testing it like that, I would like to know.
[36.22s -> 41.99s]  For my secondary, I'm using the Sandvich, which is pretty standard among most Heavies.
[41.99s -> 45.89s]  And for my melee, I'm using the Killing Gloves of Boxing.
[45.89s -> 51.19s]  Not the Gloves of Running Urgently, because guys, everybody uses the Gru.
[51.19s -> 53.39s]  Everybody and their grandmother uses the damn thing.
[53.39s -> 56.29s]  And here is a good reason why you should switch sometimes.
[56.39s -> 60.29s]  Oh, a Shabow got the crits now on the Tomislav.
[60.29s -> 63.49s]  Coming out here and just wreck house on a bunch of people.
[63.49s -> 67.39s]  Which is a great tip if you're going to use the Killing Gloves of Boxing.
[67.39s -> 69.39s]  Make sure you use the Tomislav.
[69.39s -> 74.79s]  Because guys, if you equip the Shotgun or the Tomislav, it's a much quicker slap down time.
[74.79s -> 76.49s]  You don't have to wait for a spin up.
[76.49s -> 81.03s]  You can just switch over and absolutely mow people down in seconds.
[81.03s -> 83.03s]  Playing on King of the Hill Viaduct right now.
[83.03s -> 86.44s]  And Viaduct is an awesome Heavy map.
[86.54s -> 90.14s]  I came to the realization about this like a week ago.
[90.14s -> 92.14s]  When I played Heavy on here for like the first time.
[92.14s -> 94.04s]  I never play Heavy like I said first of all.
[94.04s -> 97.18s]  And I play Heavy on here once in a blue moon.
[97.18s -> 99.98s]  But take a look at this little choke point they come out of.
[99.98s -> 102.28s]  When they turn this corner, it's too late.
[102.28s -> 106.25s]  If you're already here with your gun spun down, it's too late.
[106.25s -> 107.75s]  They're just going to get killed.
[107.75s -> 110.05s]  And especially if there's a Medic healing you too.
[110.05s -> 112.15s]  It just makes it that much better.
[112.15s -> 115.02s]  So I guess you learn something every day.
[115.02s -> 117.22s]  Get killed by that Pyro right there.
[117.22s -> 119.72s]  And that Uber charge, they had to pop it early.
[119.72s -> 121.32s]  Which is actually a good thing.
[121.32s -> 123.30s]  I will accept that death.
[123.30s -> 126.50s]  Because that Uber charge had to come all the way up the stairs.
[126.50s -> 127.70s]  All the way around the corner.
[127.70s -> 130.30s]  Their Uber was gone by the time they even got up here.
[130.30s -> 131.80s]  So I'm okay with that.
[131.80s -> 134.10s]  Even though they capped the point, it's okay.
[134.10s -> 135.70s]  At least we tried, right?
[135.70s -> 137.66s]  That's the name of the game.
[137.66s -> 142.86s]  So here comes Jerma embarrassing moment number 7,955.
[142.86s -> 143.76s]  Just embarrassing.
[143.76s -> 144.86s]  I'm sorry about this.
[144.86s -> 146.56s]  I really do apologize.
[146.56s -> 147.66s]  So I come up here, there's a Heavy.
[147.66s -> 150.36s]  We're going to do a one-on-one Heavy fight, you'd think, right?
[150.36s -> 151.66s]  I'm afraid he has full health.
[151.66s -> 153.56s]  So I run around the corner and just go,
[153.56s -> 156.76s]  well, I'm just going to switch to my sandwich and I'll be fine.
[156.76s -> 157.86s]  No, I missed it.
[157.86s -> 159.25s]  Dead.
[159.25s -> 162.05s]  And the real kicker of this is look at the health.
[162.05s -> 164.29s]  He had like 20 health.
[164.29s -> 169.09s]  Oh, if I had just stayed up there and shot him for like two seconds,
[169.09s -> 170.59s]  that would not have happened.
[170.59s -> 171.49s]  But it did.
[171.49s -> 173.29s]  Have to move on, have to deal with it.
[173.29s -> 175.79s]  Here is a tip for you guys right now.
[175.79s -> 178.59s]  Kill the Medic first before you kill the Heavy.
[178.59s -> 182.39s]  If you're in a Heavy-Medic fight, chances are if you're close enough,
[182.39s -> 183.89s]  you can kill the Medic first.
[183.89s -> 184.99s]  Definitely do that.
[184.99s -> 187.49s]  Don't just shoot the Heavy if you're that close,
[187.49s -> 189.99s]  especially because I'm using the Tomislav.
[189.99s -> 194.29s]  As we all know, the Tomislav is the weakest next to Natasha.
[194.29s -> 196.39s]  It's the weakest minigun in the game.
[196.39s -> 200.29s]  So if you're going up against a regular minigun Heavy or a Brass Beast Heavy,
[200.29s -> 202.09s]  you are not going to kill them one-on-one.
[202.09s -> 203.59s]  You're going to take health off of him,
[203.59s -> 205.99s]  but you're guaranteed not going to kill him,
[205.99s -> 208.17s]  unless of course he has lower health.
[208.17s -> 212.57s]  But seeing that he had a Medic with him and that he was using the regular minigun,
[212.57s -> 214.97s]  I had to make the decision to go for the Medic.
[214.97s -> 217.17s]  That's really important because if I didn't do that,
[217.17s -> 220.20s]  we would have both died, me and my Medic.
[220.20s -> 221.50s]  So for the next minute or so,
[221.50s -> 226.00s]  I want to talk about something that has nothing to do with Team Fortress 2.
[226.00s -> 230.33s]  I want to talk about Grandpa's upload to Machinima Respawn.
[230.33s -> 232.83s]  So if you're watching this in the future, I apologize,
[232.83s -> 235.83s]  but if you're watching this in the present, like a lot of you are,
[235.83s -> 240.33s]  Grandpa's first video is going to be on Machinima Respawn tomorrow.
[240.33s -> 243.43s]  I'm not sure if it's going to be tomorrow afternoon, tomorrow night,
[243.43s -> 246.53s]  but a lot of you wanted me to tell you when it was going to be up there,
[246.53s -> 249.23s]  and now I found out it's going to be every Friday.
[249.23s -> 250.53s]  It's going to be the same video.
[250.53s -> 254.03s]  It's going to be edited a little bit to make sense on Respawn,
[254.03s -> 257.03s]  but it's going to stay similar to the one you've already seen.
[257.03s -> 259.43s]  If you guys could please go support that video,
[259.43s -> 261.33s]  if you liked the original one,
[261.33s -> 263.43s]  I would totally, totally appreciate that.
[263.43s -> 264.93s]  And so would Grandpa.
[264.93s -> 265.73s]  Yes, I would.
[265.73s -> 266.73s]  Yeah, he would.
[266.73s -> 268.63s]  So let's get back to the gameplay here.
[268.63s -> 271.14s]  I just wanted to let you guys know about that.
[271.14s -> 275.74s]  With less than 20 seconds to go now, we look like we have this in the bag.
[275.74s -> 279.61s]  Unfortunately, though, they get on the point and they cap it.
[279.61s -> 282.01s]  So it looks like a big, big deal, but it's not.
[282.01s -> 283.11s]  Do not worry.
[283.11s -> 287.11s]  I am back here and I kill about five or six people in a row.
[287.11s -> 290.81s]  So what that means naturally is they cannot even get out to the point.
[290.81s -> 294.11s]  So once I get a couple of friends on my team to get onto that point,
[294.11s -> 296.41s]  we're going to cap it and we are going to win.
[296.41s -> 297.41s]  Come up on this left side.
[297.41s -> 298.91s]  They don't even know I'm here.
[298.91s -> 301.01s]  This medic and soldier pair don't even know I'm here.
[301.01s -> 302.41s]  I end up getting the soldier.
[302.41s -> 304.41s]  Medic goes down as well on his own, Will.
[304.41s -> 306.01s]  Don't even know how that happened.
[306.01s -> 307.71s]  Spy gets on the point, but it's not a big deal.
[307.71s -> 308.31s]  We cap it.
[308.31s -> 309.71s]  Five seconds left.
[309.71s -> 312.71s]  One Pyro gets on the point and almost gets it to overtime again,
[312.71s -> 314.71s]  but he doesn't succeed.
[314.71s -> 316.81s]  This is the end of the gameplay, guys.
[316.81s -> 318.61s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[318.61s -> 320.29s]  I really do appreciate it.
[320.29s -> 323.69s]  Shoot me a like if you enjoyed this video and make sure you be on the
[323.69s -> 326.89s]  lookout tomorrow for Grandpa on Respawn.
[326.89s -> 328.19s]  Hell yeah.
[328.19s -> 329.29s]  See you guys next time.
[329.29s -> 330.49s]  Take care, everybody.
