[0.31s -> 15.02s]  Is it really appropriate that we're both naked men?
[15.02s -> 19.02s]  Yes it is. It is appropriate.
[19.02s -> 23.02s]  Nah, you ain't taking that box. Put it back.
[23.02s -> 29.82s]  Come here, can I bash you in the face with this?
[30.82s -> 38.75s]  Oh shit!
[38.75s -> 45.75s]  Alright, explain what world does a box do more like knockback and damage than a fucking showerhead?
[45.75s -> 54.20s]  Dude, I'm gonna kill you!
[54.20s -> 57.78s]  No! Up!
[57.78s -> 61.05s]  Hey there!

[68.93s -> 70.93s]  No!
[70.93s -> 73.36s]  Where's the Cheetos?
[73.36s -> 76.36s]  Is there like any like dirty sodas anywhere around here?
[76.36s -> 81.26s]  We haven't gotten out of like the tutorial.
[84.06s -> 87.06s]  If you hadn't killed me with that cardboard box, we wouldn't be in this situation.
[87.06s -> 90.06s]  Oh wait, hold on, I'm coming. Hold on, don't worry.
[90.06s -> 93.82s]  I brought you some like potato chips.
[93.82s -> 98.82s]  This should heal all your wounds. A bag of fucking potato chips.
[98.82s -> 101.82s]  Oh, thanks, thanks.
[101.82s -> 104.82s]  I can't find anything.
[104.82s -> 108.82s]  You're gonna be there for a while. I'm in like the game right now.
[108.82s -> 111.96s]  Hold on, just hang tight.
[111.96s -> 116.96s]  So far my perspective of this game is like a concrete ground.
[116.96s -> 119.96s]  These cabinets over here look great.
[119.96s -> 121.96s]  Hold on, I'll find you something.
[121.96s -> 124.39s]  This cream.
[124.39s -> 128.39s]  There we go. I got you a large soda.
[128.39s -> 133.94s]  What if I can make it? Oh shit!
[133.94s -> 139.71s]  Get off me! I gotta bring my friend like a drink!

[143.71s -> 148.17s]  Shit!
[148.17s -> 150.98s]  No!
[150.98s -> 152.98s]  I benched my...
[152.98s -> 157.57s]  Oh shit!
[157.57s -> 163.48s]  Hold on, strong attack was what?
[163.48s -> 167.58s]  I just saw strong attack.
[167.58s -> 169.58s]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[169.58s -> 172.58s]  Did I seriously just almost kill you again?
[172.58s -> 175.58s]  No, dude. No, no, we're not gonna do this again.
[175.58s -> 177.58s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just go, just go, just go.
[177.58s -> 180.58s]  We're gonna cause way too many problems here.
[180.58s -> 182.58s]  I can't believe I almost just killed you.
[182.58s -> 189.74s]  I'm gonna throw this at you.
[189.74s -> 191.74s]  Yeah, come on, come on. Come fuck around.
[191.74s -> 195.05s]  Yeah, nice toss. Nice toss.
[197.05s -> 200.05s]  It actually pains me.
[201.05s -> 206.31s]  I can't believe I'm gonna make you like the Incredible Hulk.
[209.41s -> 211.41s]  Don't kill me, don't kill me.
[211.41s -> 215.10s]  We've had enough. I have a propane tank.
[215.10s -> 220.83s]  Oh, you have a propane tank, huh? Is that what you have?
[224.74s -> 229.15s]  Why can't we stop this?
[229.15s -> 233.03s]  No, if I go die, we're gonna have to do this all over again.
[233.03s -> 235.03s]  It's all up to me. Go get the drink.
[235.03s -> 237.03s]  It's all up to you. Just go get a drink.
[237.03s -> 239.03s]  And it's all up to me, he says.
[239.03s -> 241.03s]  He's all up to me and then he dies.
[241.03s -> 243.72s]  I didn't even get out the door.
[243.72s -> 246.72s]  You didn't even get out the fucking door.
[246.72s -> 248.72s]  Please stop killing each other.
[248.72s -> 254.65s]  No, no. When you give people this type of freedom with this amount of items,
[254.65s -> 260.15s]  there's no way you're gonna get out the front door.
[260.15s -> 262.15s]  Grab a bunch of stuff.
[262.15s -> 265.15s]  All the food's in here, like orange juice and shit.
[265.15s -> 267.52s]  Oh, you wanna have a little breakfast party?
[267.52s -> 268.52s]  Mustard.
[268.52s -> 275.56s]  Let's go, let's go. I got enough water for the both of us.
[275.56s -> 278.56s]  Hey, do you think we can get any computer games you can play out here?
[278.56s -> 279.56s]  Move.
[279.56s -> 280.56s]  Dude, oh.

[282.56s -> 284.56s]  Oh, you want this? Yeah, okay, thanks, I'll take it.
[284.56s -> 285.80s]  Careful!
[285.80s -> 289.80s]  No, I want, can we just please, can we just please play Team Fortress 2 on the computer?
[289.80s -> 290.80s]  Can I get the damn milk?
[290.80s -> 292.80s]  Hold on, I don't wanna play, look at this.
[292.80s -> 293.80s]  Okay, here we go.
[293.80s -> 295.80s]  Do-do-do-do-do, boom, boom, boom.
[295.80s -> 299.80s]  I got a more headshot, I got a, I'm the best.
[308.43s -> 310.99s]  Get me out of this room.
[310.99s -> 311.99s]  I don't think we can keep this person alive.
[311.99s -> 312.99s]  You don't think we can?
[312.99s -> 313.99s]  I won't bet money on it.
[313.99s -> 314.99s]  Okay, well.
[314.99s -> 317.99s]  Because we're not gonna, we're gonna get distracted by something.
[317.99s -> 322.51s]  Well, just try, I want the extra points.
[322.51s -> 325.90s]  I want like the double points.
[325.90s -> 326.90s]  I want the triple points.
[326.90s -> 327.90s]  Let's go then.
[327.90s -> 330.90s]  She is being surrounded right now, do you not see this?
[330.90s -> 334.04s]  And then all my stuff's broken.
[334.04s -> 335.04s]  And someone's biting my penis.
[335.04s -> 337.04s]  Uh, maybe not.
[337.04s -> 344.26s]  Maybe not.
[344.26s -> 345.26s]  I'll just wait over here.
[345.26s -> 347.26s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's more people in here.
[347.26s -> 348.26s]  They're having like a reunion.
[348.26s -> 351.26s]  They're like hugging each other and stuff and there's zombies everywhere.
[351.26s -> 353.26s]  What the hell are they doing?
[353.26s -> 358.26s]  Dude, you don't like, you don't hug it out during a zombie apocalypse in like a room full of 30 zombies.
[358.26s -> 360.94s]  Let's go.
[360.94s -> 361.94s]  We don't have time.
[361.94s -> 364.63s]  Let's go, Gordon.
[364.63s -> 365.63s]  Come on, Gordon.
[365.63s -> 368.32s]  Come on, Gordy.
[368.32s -> 370.32s]  What the hell are they doing?
[370.32s -> 371.32s]  Oh, shit.
[371.32s -> 372.32s]  What?
[372.32s -> 373.32s]  That's not what I thought I was equipping.
[373.32s -> 375.32s]  What do you mean?
[380.29s -> 382.46s]  Aren't you so pretty.
[382.46s -> 385.46s]  They look like, I don't know, just like plaid shirts.
[385.46s -> 389.46s]  Well, can you stop like trying on like women's clothing and come like fight these guys?
[389.46s -> 390.46s]  These people are dying.
[390.46s -> 392.46s]  I gotta take care of them.
[392.46s -> 394.46s]  Oh, my God.
[394.46s -> 397.41s]  We got two people dying.
[397.41s -> 401.41s]  I'm fighting off a zombie apocalypse and you're trying on women's clothing.
[401.41s -> 403.41s]  I have the only loaded gun.
[403.41s -> 406.97s]  Yeah, you're the only person with a gun.
[406.97s -> 410.10s]  Thanks for the help.
[410.10s -> 411.10s]  Oh, shit.
[411.10s -> 417.76s]  Don't worry, I got you.
[417.76s -> 419.76s]  Well, Lashandra's almost dead.
[419.76s -> 420.76s]  Can we just go?
[420.76s -> 424.76s]  I would really appreciate that if you would get over here.
[424.76s -> 425.76s]  I don't have any weapons left.
[425.76s -> 428.76s]  And Lashandra takes a wild swing at my face and kills me.
[428.76s -> 430.76s]  Dude, what the hell was the point of that?
[430.76s -> 432.76s]  Will you quit trying on shoes and get over here?
