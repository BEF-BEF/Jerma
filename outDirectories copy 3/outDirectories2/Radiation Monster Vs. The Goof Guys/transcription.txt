[0.31s -> 9.27s]  So why can't I say names?
[9.27s -> 11.27s]  I thought there were like 50 characters in this game.
[11.27s -> 13.51s]  I don't know, I thought so too.
[13.51s -> 15.82s]  But apparently there's only four.
[15.82s -> 18.50s]  Oh, well.
[18.50s -> 20.50s]  Alright.
[20.50s -> 22.50s]  There's 20 characters in the game.
[22.50s -> 24.50s]  Just go to random locations. Doesn't really fucking matter.
[24.50s -> 26.50s]  Like, let's just play the game.
[26.50s -> 28.50s]  Alright, let's go.
[28.50s -> 30.50s]  Oh, look out, it's a spooky statue.
[32.68s -> 34.68s]  Okay, so Jerma is the red vest.
[34.68s -> 36.68s]  I hear static.
[36.68s -> 38.68s]  Yeah, there's a tape.
[38.68s -> 40.68s]  Oh, get that tape.
[40.68s -> 43.86s]  Alright, we got it.
[43.86s -> 45.86s]  Is that something back there?
[45.86s -> 47.86s]  Can you guys see that? No, that's just like a tree.
[47.86s -> 49.86s]  So the closer you get
[49.86s -> 51.86s]  to the cassette tapes, they start buzzing
[51.86s -> 53.86s]  and making noise and stuff so you can find them.
[53.86s -> 55.86s]  I feel like Stealth, is this you? This looks like you.
[55.86s -> 57.86s]  That's not me.
[57.86s -> 59.86s]  That looks like Bizarro
[59.86s -> 61.86s]  MLC Stealth.
[61.86s -> 63.86s]  Turn around, turn around, run, run, run.
[63.86s -> 65.86s]  He's right behind us. He's literally right behind us.
[65.86s -> 67.86s]  There's this giant monster running.
[67.86s -> 69.86s]  Jesus Christ.
[69.86s -> 71.86s]  What if he's gone?
[71.86s -> 73.86s]  What happens if you look at him?
[73.86s -> 75.86s]  Is he gone?
[75.86s -> 77.86s]  Where'd he go?
[77.86s -> 79.86s]  I don't know.
[79.86s -> 81.86s]  Why are we all acting so nonchalant about this, by the way?
[83.86s -> 85.86s]  This is not running.
[85.86s -> 87.86s]  You'll never catch me.
[87.86s -> 90.17s]  That's not running. Are you guys all running?
[90.17s -> 92.17s]  Everybody sprint right now.
[92.17s -> 94.17s]  I want to watch people sprint.
[94.17s -> 96.17s]  I want to watch people sprint.
[96.17s -> 98.17s]  Let me sprint away, except it's just walking.
[100.17s -> 102.17s]  He's right next to us.
[102.17s -> 104.17s]  What?
[104.17s -> 106.17s]  He really is.
[106.17s -> 108.17s]  He's right there.
[108.17s -> 110.17s]  This guy's a fucking chump.
[110.17s -> 112.17s]  Where is he?
[112.17s -> 114.17s]  Where's the attack button?
[114.17s -> 116.17s]  I'm telling you right now.
[116.17s -> 118.17s]  I'm going to punch this guy right in his face.
[118.17s -> 120.41s]  He's not here anymore.
[120.41s -> 122.41s]  Oh no, I lost everybody.
[122.41s -> 124.41s]  You guys are right next to me.
[130.41s -> 132.41s]  That guy's a wuss.
[132.41s -> 134.41s]  Are you serious?
[134.41s -> 136.41s]  It was scary for two seconds.
[136.41s -> 138.41s]  He just stands there and stares at you.
[138.41s -> 141.61s]  He just goes like this.
[141.61s -> 143.61s]  Am I staring at him?
[143.61s -> 145.61s]  Why is my guy freaking out?
[145.61s -> 147.61s]  I think if you sprint too much, you get scared easier.
[149.61s -> 151.61s]  What's the problem?
[151.61s -> 153.61s]  I don't know.
[153.61s -> 155.61s]  He's behind us.
[155.61s -> 157.61s]  He's behind us too.
[157.61s -> 159.61s]  I don't know where to go. I'm going this way.
[159.61s -> 161.61s]  Let's go to the green thing.
[161.61s -> 163.61s]  The green thing is making us all screwed up.
[163.61s -> 165.61s]  I'm not walking to the green thing.
[165.61s -> 167.61s]  It's like a big ball of radiation or something.
[167.61s -> 169.61s]  Why is this thing emitting radiation?
[169.61s -> 171.61s]  What happens if I touch it?
[171.61s -> 173.61s]  Is anybody close to me right now?
[173.61s -> 175.61s]  He's screaming.
[179.61s -> 181.61s]  We lost him.
[181.61s -> 183.61s]  I'm dead.
[183.61s -> 185.61s]  I went to the radiation thing
[185.61s -> 187.61s]  and he popped up in my fucking face.
[191.61s -> 193.61s]  Where am I? I'm a ghost.
[193.61s -> 195.61s]  Can you guys see me?
[195.61s -> 197.61s]  I swear to God, I'm a ghost.
[197.61s -> 199.61s]  Is there somebody inside of this thing?
[199.61s -> 201.61s]  I see you.
[201.61s -> 203.61s]  I'm going to come attack you guys.
[203.61s -> 205.61s]  I think I have to come kill you guys now.
[205.61s -> 207.61s]  I'm a ghost.
[207.61s -> 209.61s]  That looks really creepy.
[209.61s -> 211.61s]  I can't hurt you guys?
[211.61s -> 213.61s]  You look scary.
[213.61s -> 215.61s]  What do I do? Just stick around with you guys?
[217.61s -> 219.61s]  Isn't this a Bill Cosby movie?
[219.61s -> 221.61s]  Why is my flashlight so dark?
[221.61s -> 223.61s]  The guy is very tired.
[223.61s -> 225.61s]  And his flashlight is flickering.
[225.61s -> 227.61s]  His flashlight is flickering.
[227.61s -> 229.61s]  This rock formation looks like a genus.
[233.61s -> 235.61s]  It looks like a middle finger.
[242.30s -> 244.30s]  Do not go to the green radiation rock.
[244.30s -> 246.30s]  I thought it was a super magic power
[246.30s -> 248.30s]  like I was going to get flight or something if I touched it.
[248.30s -> 250.30s]  You're right, I did.
[250.30s -> 252.30s]  I did get super magic powers.
[252.30s -> 254.30s]  You're forever trapped on this earth as a ghost.
[256.30s -> 258.86s]  Is this another person?
[258.86s -> 260.86s]  Guys, come over here.
[260.86s -> 262.86s]  Where's over here?
[262.86s -> 264.86s]  What is this thing?
[264.86s -> 266.86s]  What is this?
[266.86s -> 268.86s]  This is going to kill us.
[268.86s -> 270.86s]  Stealth died.
[270.86s -> 272.86s]  I don't see. What are you talking about?
[272.86s -> 274.86s]  That's where the person died.
[276.86s -> 278.86s]  What just happened?
[278.86s -> 280.86s]  Piece of crap.
[280.86s -> 282.86s]  We just got you killed?
[282.86s -> 284.86s]  How did you both die instantly?
[284.86s -> 287.80s]  Look at this blood on the walls.
[287.80s -> 289.80s]  This blood on the walls.
[289.80s -> 291.80s]  This blood going up the stairs.
[291.80s -> 293.80s]  I hear some white noise.
[293.80s -> 295.80s]  I hear some noise too.
[295.80s -> 297.80s]  That's green radiation.
[297.80s -> 299.80s]  Somebody touch it again.
[299.80s -> 301.80s]  That's like in the middle room.
[303.80s -> 305.80s]  Stop looking at it.
[305.80s -> 307.80s]  Somebody just poured it into the wall.
[307.80s -> 309.80s]  Who just went in the wall?
[309.80s -> 312.42s]  Who are we missing right now?
[312.42s -> 314.42s]  Who are we missing right now?
[314.42s -> 316.86s]  Boo.
[316.86s -> 319.29s]  I think Boo did.
[319.29s -> 321.29s]  Boo just teleported into the wall and he's gone.
[321.29s -> 323.66s]  What?
[323.66s -> 325.96s]  Don't look at it.
[325.96s -> 328.33s]  Don't look at the roof.
[328.33s -> 330.33s]  Stealth, why are you walking underneath it?
[330.33s -> 332.33s]  Why are you walking underneath it?
[332.33s -> 334.33s]  That's like a tear drop of radiation and hatred.
[334.33s -> 337.85s]  What are you doing?
[337.85s -> 339.85s]  Oh my god.
[339.85s -> 341.85s]  This is where we lose.
[341.85s -> 343.85s]  He's literally right next to me.
[343.85s -> 346.22s]  There's a tape.
[346.22s -> 348.46s]  Yeah.
[348.46s -> 350.46s]  Got it.
[350.46s -> 353.02s]  Six out of eight baby.
[353.02s -> 355.38s]  Where's the monster now?
[355.38s -> 357.38s]  Where's that pile of crap monster?
[357.38s -> 359.38s]  It's getting to a point really right now
[359.38s -> 361.38s]  where I can't even see on the screen.
[361.38s -> 363.38s]  Alright we have to turn around.
[363.38s -> 365.38s]  We have to go back in tear drop radiation.
[365.38s -> 367.62s]  No we don't.
[367.62s -> 369.62s]  He's going to be right here.
[369.62s -> 371.62s]  He's behind us now so we have to go in tear drop radiation.
[371.62s -> 373.62s]  Are you serious?
[373.62s -> 375.62s]  We have to go back in tear drop radiation.
