[0.31s -> 15.71s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Shank 2 multiplayer first look, I guess you could call this.
[15.71s -> 21.21s]  The official release of Shank 2 was, I believe, today or last night, something like that.
[21.21s -> 28.21s]  And this game is a lot of fun. This game is awesome. So I suggest you try this game out. If you have never played it before, it's awesome.
[28.51s -> 34.51s]  Playing the multiplayer co-op survival mode with Italics, who's a good friend of mine. His link will be in the description.
[34.51s -> 40.51s]  So go check him out. He's a cool dude, a good friend of mine. So let's get this started. The live commentary is going to start right now.
[40.51s -> 45.90s]  I'm going to cut a little bit between some things, but enjoy guys and let me know what you think.
[45.90s -> 47.90s]  Yeah, we're going to have to explain how the game is played as well.
[47.90s -> 49.33s]  Yeah.
[49.33s -> 53.21s]  But you are. You're like a yellow jumpsuit.
[53.21s -> 54.21s]  I'm like Kill Bill.
[54.21s -> 56.21s]  That's what I was thinking actually.
[56.21s -> 58.21s]  Uma Thurman up in this biatch.
[58.51s -> 66.74s]  Yeah, so I guess for those of you that don't know what is going on right now, this is not Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
[66.74s -> 68.74s]  This is a...
[68.74s -> 71.98s]  Doesn't it look like it? It kind of looks like Smash Bros.
[71.98s -> 73.98s]  I guess Smash for the boat.
[73.98s -> 77.47s]  Yeah, we're on the boat. But this is the multiplayer.
[77.47s -> 83.78s]  And the multiplayer is you have to defend waves and waves. You have to defend against waves and waves of people.
[83.78s -> 89.78s]  And I'm assuming it's going to get increasingly difficult. So we shall see where this goes.
[90.08s -> 94.32s]  We got to defend these, yeah, these bombs here on the bottom.
[94.32s -> 97.07s]  This one up top too.
[97.07s -> 99.07s]  I kind of like this Uma Thurman.
[99.07s -> 101.07s]  I'm like shooting up into the air.
[101.07s -> 105.07s]  I'm like celebrating. I'm just like, yeah.
[105.07s -> 107.48s]  All right, wave one.
[107.48s -> 109.48s]  New item, tequila. Heal yourself.
[109.48s -> 110.48s]  Okay.
[110.48s -> 111.48s]  I've got a fish.
[111.48s -> 115.92s]  Can you throw these things? I want to butcher somebody in the face.
[115.92s -> 117.22s]  What do you have?
[117.22s -> 121.22s]  I have like a butcher knife. I want to throw it at somebody's face.
[123.68s -> 126.68s]  Oh no, get off that bomb. Oh God, this guy's going to get it.
[126.68s -> 128.68s]  Oh, we have one down there?
[128.68s -> 131.56s]  I keep overshooting it.
[131.56s -> 135.80s]  No, get off that. I got to do more grabs, man.
[135.80s -> 137.80s]  Look at those combos piling up right there.
[137.80s -> 138.80s]  I know, geez.
[138.80s -> 141.17s]  All right, we're good.
[141.17s -> 143.17s]  I'm going to go up top. You stay down there.
[143.17s -> 146.17s]  Because there's one up top. If that one goes down, we're in a lot of trouble.
[146.17s -> 152.41s]  It's a good idea. We get to split up, but watch for health too because you are getting close to dying.
[152.41s -> 154.41s]  Oh, there's a guy down here.
[154.71s -> 155.71s]  Oh, disarm that bomb.
[155.71s -> 158.71s]  Got it, I got it. I'm disarming. Cutting the wire, cutting the red wire.
[158.71s -> 159.71s]  That's right.
[159.71s -> 160.71s]  How much money do I have?
[160.71s -> 161.71s]  Got to buy some tequila.
[161.71s -> 166.01s]  Yeah, this girl has like minus 25% health or something.
[166.01s -> 168.32s]  Probably wasn't a great idea to do that.
[168.32s -> 170.32s]  What is that on the ground next to you flashing?
[170.32s -> 172.32s]  I think it's a pizza.
[172.32s -> 175.32s]  What is this? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
[175.32s -> 177.32s]  Yeah, who wants a pizza?
[177.32s -> 179.32s]  I'll take pepperoni, onions, mushroom.
[179.32s -> 183.13s]  You can definitely throw, how do you throw these things?
[183.13s -> 185.13s]  I am about to die.
[185.43s -> 189.43s]  I'm up here like being an idiot. I've got to help you, hold on.
[189.43s -> 190.43s]  I'm retreating.
[190.43s -> 193.43s]  Don't worry, I've got this thing. It didn't even matter.
[193.43s -> 198.70s]  I'm doing the jump. No, get off this bomb.
[198.70s -> 200.70s]  Oh, he threw me off the boat.
[200.70s -> 201.70s]  Are you dead?
[201.70s -> 202.70s]  No, I'm still alive, barely.
[202.70s -> 206.70s]  Oh my god, I am going to die. I'm staying back to my range.
[206.70s -> 207.70s]  I'm dead.
[207.70s -> 210.70s]  No, I'm okay. I'm alright, I'm good. I'll revive you.
[210.70s -> 212.70s]  I've got to use some skills here.
[212.70s -> 215.71s]  Come on, come on!
[215.71s -> 216.71s]  Nice.
[216.71s -> 217.71s]  Got it, we got it.
[218.01s -> 220.51s]  Oh, I'm down now, I'm down.
[220.51s -> 223.51s]  Oh, it's right bumper. Right bumper is how you throw stuff.
[223.51s -> 225.68s]  You need a heal, sir.
[225.68s -> 227.68s]  Oh my god!
[227.68s -> 229.68s]  You hop into the...
[229.68s -> 231.68s]  No, I just jumped down like an idiot.
[231.68s -> 233.68s]  I'm going to try to lead him up here.
[233.68s -> 234.68s]  Come on.
[234.68s -> 237.82s]  Oh, come on big man.
[237.82s -> 239.82s]  Alright, revive.
[239.82s -> 241.82s]  Get out of there, just run.
[241.82s -> 243.82s]  Leave my friend alone.
[243.82s -> 246.44s]  Oh god, I'm running.
[246.44s -> 248.44s]  I'm dead, I'm dead.
[248.74s -> 250.74s]  Alright, I'm going to shop shoot him.
[250.74s -> 253.37s]  I got him caught like in a glitch.
[253.37s -> 255.37s]  Okay, yeah, come on, follow me over here.
[255.37s -> 257.12s]  That's right.
[257.12s -> 259.12s]  Fell right into my trap.
[259.12s -> 261.12s]  There you go, alright, sweet.
[261.12s -> 262.55s]  Oh my god.
[262.55s -> 264.55s]  I've got to use more range.
[264.55s -> 266.55s]  Get him under the boat and I'll drop the boat on him.
[266.55s -> 267.55s]  Nice, nice.
[267.55s -> 269.92s]  I'm at low health again.
[269.92s -> 272.10s]  No, I missed that.
[272.10s -> 274.10s]  Oh my god, I'm dead.
[274.10s -> 276.10s]  Oh, escape!
[276.10s -> 279.10s]  I barely escaped.
[279.10s -> 282.30s]  Oh my god, he can run?
[282.60s -> 284.60s]  You're not going to call him a boar, are you?
[284.60s -> 285.60s]  I really want to.
[285.60s -> 286.60s]  I have enough money.
[286.60s -> 287.60s]  I'm going to do it.
[287.60s -> 288.60s]  Here we go.
[288.60s -> 289.60s]  Alright, let's see what it does.
[289.60s -> 290.60s]  Battle boar.
[290.60s -> 291.60s]  That is battle boar right there.
[291.60s -> 292.60s]  He's defending this crate.
[292.60s -> 294.60s]  Oh, that wasn't a total waste of money.
[294.60s -> 296.60s]  Oh no, oh, there he goes.
[296.60s -> 298.78s]  Just sit back here and unload.
[298.78s -> 300.08s]  Oh, look at that.
[300.08s -> 302.08s]  It's going to be sad when that pet dies.
[302.08s -> 304.08s]  I think he just died.
[304.08s -> 306.08s]  Oh my god, I'm going to get back broken.
[306.08s -> 308.22s]  Whoa.
[308.22s -> 310.22s]  Just going to shoot in the air.
[310.22s -> 311.22s]  We almost got him.
[311.22s -> 312.22s]  We almost got him, yes.
[312.22s -> 313.22s]  Nice, get that money.
[313.52s -> 314.52s]  Alright, buy some tequila.
[314.52s -> 315.52s]  Buy some tequila.
[315.52s -> 316.52s]  Decoy.
[316.52s -> 317.52s]  Dammit, I'm trying to turn on the fire.
[317.52s -> 319.52s]  Man, this guy is annoying me.
[319.52s -> 321.52s]  He's got like this grenade launcher.
[321.52s -> 324.68s]  There we go.
[324.68s -> 325.68s]  I can't aim.
[325.68s -> 326.68s]  I can't aim.
[326.68s -> 329.68s]  I'm just trying to shoot him from afar now.
[329.68s -> 331.68s]  It's like shooting up in the air for some reason.
[331.68s -> 332.68s]  Pounce.
[332.68s -> 333.68s]  Get pounced.
[333.68s -> 335.68s]  Wait, you can use this thing?
[335.68s -> 336.68s]  I can use this thing.
[336.68s -> 337.68s]  This grenade launcher.
[337.68s -> 340.98s]  That's what I was trying to use, but it was just shooting up in the air.
[340.98s -> 341.98s]  We have one to defuse up here.
[341.98s -> 342.98s]  Oh, come on.
[342.98s -> 343.98s]  Two defused.
[343.98s -> 344.98s]  I'm defusing this one.
[345.28s -> 346.28s]  Uh oh.
[346.28s -> 347.28s]  I got one.
[347.28s -> 350.93s]  There's another one up here.
[350.93s -> 351.93s]  No.
[351.93s -> 355.39s]  Alright, I'm defusing it.
[355.39s -> 357.69s]  They're planning down there below again.
[357.69s -> 359.69s]  Oh god, come on now.
[359.69s -> 361.00s]  Get lit.
[361.00s -> 362.56s]  I got this one.
[362.56s -> 363.56s]  Alright, I'm defusing this one.
[363.56s -> 364.56s]  We're good.
[364.56s -> 365.56s]  That is teamwork right there.
[365.56s -> 366.56s]  That is teamwork.
[366.56s -> 369.56s]  I wish you could high five in this game because we totally would.
[369.56s -> 372.56s]  Yeah, be a little bit more like Portal 2.
[372.56s -> 376.12s]  Okay, I still got shots in this thing.
[376.12s -> 379.48s]  I'm just going to fire and spam them.
[379.78s -> 383.78s]  We're going to give you all the ranged guns since you have the controller.
[383.78s -> 386.78s]  Yeah, I am the one with the controller.
[386.78s -> 390.47s]  Uh oh, fire, fire.
[390.47s -> 391.47s]  Get out of there.
[391.47s -> 392.47s]  Alright, I prevented this.
[392.47s -> 393.47s]  Oh, I blew up.
[393.47s -> 394.47s]  They got the top one.
[394.47s -> 395.47s]  Oh, they got it?
[395.47s -> 398.47s]  I didn't even know it got planted on.
[398.47s -> 401.40s]  Alright, the guy below is planting.
[401.40s -> 402.40s]  Not for long.
[402.40s -> 403.77s]  Oh, I kicked him right off.
[403.77s -> 405.77s]  I just totally missed every single time.
[405.77s -> 409.46s]  I'm about to go down again, I think.
[409.46s -> 410.46s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[410.76s -> 413.76s]  Not if I bring out Battle Boar.
[413.76s -> 414.76s]  Awesome.
[414.76s -> 416.76s]  Alright, there's another bomb engineer.
[416.76s -> 421.76s]  Alright, we can leave the bottom floor now and focus on the middle and top.
[421.76s -> 424.76s]  Because Steve the Battle Boar is taking people out.
[424.76s -> 427.76s]  Quick, you've got no time.
[427.76s -> 429.76s]  Heavy attacks, man.
[429.76s -> 430.76s]  2,000 bucks.
[430.76s -> 432.76s]  I don't get that kind of cash.
[432.76s -> 437.30s]  Oh, they've got riot shields.
[437.30s -> 438.30s]  What is this?
[438.30s -> 439.30s]  Oh, is this Call of Duty?
[439.30s -> 440.92s]  Uh oh.
[440.92s -> 441.92s]  They've got like Call of Duty riot shields.
[441.92s -> 442.92s]  They're planting.
[443.22s -> 444.22s]  Oh, God.
[444.22s -> 445.22s]  Is he planting?
[445.22s -> 446.22s]  He planted.
[446.22s -> 447.22s]  I can't get up there.
[447.22s -> 448.59s]  Here we go.
[448.59s -> 450.22s]  Alright, I'm defusing.
[450.22s -> 451.22s]  Oh, God.
[451.22s -> 452.22s]  Oh, no.
[452.22s -> 453.22s]  This could be the end.
[453.22s -> 454.22s]  I'm just throwing grenades.
[454.22s -> 456.22s]  I don't even know where they're going.
[456.22s -> 457.22s]  I'm down.
[457.22s -> 458.22s]  No, no.
[458.22s -> 459.22s]  Diffuse it.
[459.22s -> 460.22s]  I got you.
[460.22s -> 461.22s]  I got you back.
[461.22s -> 462.22s]  I got it.
[462.22s -> 463.22s]  That is clutch.
[463.22s -> 464.22s]  Clutch right there.
[464.22s -> 465.22s]  We're about dead.
[465.22s -> 466.22s]  Oh, yeah?
[466.22s -> 467.39s]  Turret.
[467.39s -> 468.39s]  I just built it.
[468.39s -> 469.39s]  I am dead.
[469.39s -> 470.63s]  What is it doing?
[470.63s -> 471.63s]  The turret's not doing anything.
[471.63s -> 472.63s]  Oh, there we go.
[472.63s -> 473.63s]  There we go.
[473.93s -> 475.24s]  It's doing something now.
[475.24s -> 476.24s]  I need to revive down here.
[476.24s -> 479.54s]  Oh, I can't even get down there.
[479.54s -> 481.23s]  Oh, my God.
[481.23s -> 482.23s]  I just jumped it.
[482.23s -> 484.23s]  I'm so confused right now.
[484.23s -> 485.23s]  You still got this.
[485.23s -> 486.23s]  No, I'm dead.
[486.23s -> 487.23s]  Maybe we are dead.
[487.23s -> 488.23s]  We just lost it.
[488.23s -> 489.23s]  Wave 15.
[489.23s -> 490.23s]  That was wave 15.
[490.23s -> 491.23s]  Wave 15.
[491.23s -> 492.23s]  That was pretty good.
[492.23s -> 495.53s]  That was pretty solid right there.
[495.53s -> 499.90s]  Man, that's embarrassing.
[499.90s -> 501.90s]  Money earned 10,000 to 4,000.
[501.90s -> 503.90s]  I got seven disarms though.
[504.20s -> 506.20s]  Hey, I do have the controller though.
[506.20s -> 508.20s]  Let's be fair.
[508.20s -> 509.20s]  Do what you do.
