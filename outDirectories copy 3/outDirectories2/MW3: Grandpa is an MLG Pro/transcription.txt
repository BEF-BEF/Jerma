[0.06s -> 4.06s]  Hello everybody, welcome to Modern Warfare 3.
[4.06s -> 10.06s]  If you're as excited for this game as I was, being one of the top ten players in the world.
[10.06s -> 13.06s]  That's right, this is Jerma's grandfather here.
[13.06s -> 16.06s]  Not Jerma, he's not as good as me, he can't give you the tips.
[16.06s -> 19.06s]  He can't give you the strategies that I can.
[19.06s -> 22.06s]  So let me just tell you that I'm one of the best players in the world.
[22.06s -> 26.06s]  And I'll show you right here, look at this, get the fuck out of here buddy.
[26.06s -> 29.06s]  Let me tell you, I have so much confidence in my game.
[29.06s -> 37.06s]  If I die one time in this fucking gameplay, then I'm going to pay everybody $6,000.
[37.06s -> 39.06s]  You understand me? That's how good I am.
[39.06s -> 47.65s]  I usually put up 400... Jeremy! Jeremy, come down here!
[47.65s -> 52.49s]  Hey, how do I restart recordings?
[52.49s -> 54.49s]  I can't hear you, what?
[54.49s -> 57.49s]  Come here, how do I restart a recording?
[57.49s -> 59.49s]  What are you doing? You're recording?
[59.49s -> 63.49s]  I just fucking told everybody I was going to give them $6,000.
[63.49s -> 65.49s]  I don't have that kind of fucking money.
[65.49s -> 66.49s]  Oh gee, it's F9.
[66.49s -> 67.49s]  It's F9?
[67.49s -> 68.49s]  Yeah.
[68.49s -> 69.49s]  Okay, well I just...
[69.49s -> 72.49s]  Hey everybody, it's Jerma's grandfather here.
[72.49s -> 77.49s]  Bringing you a first ever modern Warfare 3 gameplay on his channel.
[77.49s -> 83.49s]  And I'm going to tell you all the tips and all the strategies of how to be the best player in Planet Earth.
[83.49s -> 87.49s]  And I'm pretty good at this game, I'm not that good, but I've been...
[88.49s -> 90.49s]  People have told me that I'm pretty good.
[90.49s -> 94.73s]  So this gun is the SCAR-L and the attachments on it.
[94.73s -> 96.73s]  And you're going to be the red dot sight.
[96.73s -> 100.73s]  And it's going to have less recoil.
[100.73s -> 107.73s]  And the perks are going to be Hardline Pro, Sleight of Hand, and I don't remember the third one.
[107.73s -> 112.73s]  So I've found that if you want to be lighter, you want to throw all your grenades out.
[113.73s -> 115.73s]  Within the first two seconds of the game.
[115.73s -> 117.73s]  And every time you respawn.
[117.73s -> 119.73s]  Because you don't want to carry that extra fucking weight.
[119.73s -> 121.73s]  You know, that's just extra weight.
[121.73s -> 126.22s]  And if you happen to hit somebody on your team with a flashbang, fuck them.
[126.22s -> 133.22s]  Another tip I want to give you is always unload your entire clip whenever you shoot the gun.
[133.22s -> 135.22s]  Because it just scares people away.
[135.22s -> 137.22s]  They see the spray and they get scared of you.
[137.22s -> 140.22s]  And that's how you show real dominance.
[140.22s -> 141.22s]  You say, here's my gun.
[141.22s -> 144.22s]  And here's me unloading the fucking whole clip on you.
[144.22s -> 146.22s]  And hold on, I have to diarrhea.
[146.22s -> 149.72s]  Okay, I'm back from diarrhea-ing.
[149.72s -> 151.72s]  And I got another tip for you.
[151.72s -> 154.72s]  This one is for communicating before the game.
[154.72s -> 158.72s]  You always want to make sure people understand what your plan is.
[158.72s -> 160.72s]  Because you have to make sure they know what you're talking about.
[160.72s -> 162.96s]  So make sure here's an example.
[162.96s -> 167.96s]  Has anybody in here seen the new movie with Adam Sandler with his big balls?
[167.96s -> 170.44s]  Wow, you're old.
[170.44s -> 173.44s]  Shut up, alright? Jesus, fuck.
[173.44s -> 175.44s]  Here's a scoreboard from the game.
[175.44s -> 179.44s]  And as you can tell, I got 13 kills.
[179.44s -> 184.44s]  And 15 people in the game said I was a cool guy.
[184.44s -> 185.44s]  And they got rid of deaths.
[185.44s -> 186.44s]  There's no more deaths.
[186.44s -> 188.44s]  I did not doctor this photo.
[188.44s -> 190.68s]  So it looks like this for everybody.
[190.68s -> 195.68s]  And if it doesn't look like this, then you have a computer bug.
[195.68s -> 197.68s]  So I'll talk to you guys later.
[197.68s -> 199.68s]  See you. Have fun in the game, you fuckers.
