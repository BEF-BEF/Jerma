[0.00s -> 12.26s]  Don't head out to sea understock. No one beats my prices. Friend, come and see for yourself.
[12.26s -> 15.26s]  Got some coin to spend? What? Up!
[15.26s -> 19.26s]  Shut up! Keep that.
[19.26s -> 23.26s]  Have a look. No matter what you pick, I guarantee you'll love it.
[23.26s -> 25.26s]  Shut up!
[25.26s -> 28.26s]  Shit! Where's your eyes?
[28.26s -> 32.26s]  Friends, come see what I've got in stock today.
[33.26s -> 35.26s]  Swab the deck!
[35.26s -> 37.62s]  Sweep the floors!
[37.62s -> 40.95s]  Sweep the cannon!
[40.95s -> 44.22s]  Be a lookout!
[44.22s -> 46.78s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[46.78s -> 48.78s]  You're gonna come on my boat!
[48.78s -> 51.14s]  And not do work?
[51.14s -> 57.30s]  You're the one limey bastard that's gonna get a knife straight into your skull!
[57.30s -> 59.30s]  You know what? You can stay.
[59.30s -> 63.98s]  You can stay.
[63.98s -> 69.03s]  Go bird.
[69.03s -> 73.03s]  Go, do it again. Steal from this guy too.
[73.03s -> 76.03s]  Good job. Good job. You picked up a couple of his hairs.
[76.03s -> 78.03s]  Nice. Two of his hairs.
[78.03s -> 80.03s]  How do you do?
[80.03s -> 82.03s]  Oh, fine. How do you do?
[82.03s -> 84.03s]  How do you do?
[84.03s -> 86.03s]  God be with you.
[86.03s -> 88.03s]  God be with you.
[88.03s -> 90.03s]  Good day. Good day to you.
[90.03s -> 92.03s]  How is it? How do you do?
[92.03s -> 94.03s]  Oh, fine. How do you do?
[94.03s -> 98.32s]  Oh, fine. How do you do?
[98.32s -> 104.63s]  Something wrong with my bird.
[104.63s -> 107.63s]  Stupid pig. Get out of here.
[107.63s -> 112.97s]  What the fuck is that? Is that a gorilla? Is that a monkey?
[112.97s -> 118.91s]  What are these animals doing? Why are they just all hostile?
[118.91s -> 121.91s]  If you're this close to the town, get out of here.
[121.91s -> 124.86s]  Alright, pig. Get him.
[124.86s -> 128.10s]  Get him, pig.
[128.10s -> 130.10s]  He just threw a rock at me.
[130.10s -> 133.10s]  You're gonna throw rocks? That's what you do?
[133.10s -> 135.10s]  You little shit.
[135.10s -> 139.88s]  I'm glad I get to see the pitching machine monkey.
[139.88s -> 142.18s]  It's rapidly throwing rocks.
[142.18s -> 144.87s]  I just like the batting cages.
[146.62s -> 148.62s]  Holy Jesus!
[148.62s -> 152.53s]  What the fuck?
[152.53s -> 154.53s]  Why is it like mountain lions?
[155.53s -> 157.77s]  Help me.
[157.77s -> 159.77s]  Help me, guys. Quick.
[159.77s -> 163.67s]  God be with you.
[163.67s -> 167.42s]  Good day. Good day.
[167.42s -> 178.17s]  Indeed. Oh, please.
[178.17s -> 183.61s]  For some ale.
[183.61s -> 185.61s]  Good day to you.
[185.61s -> 187.61s]  That Spanish commander, what's his name?
[187.61s -> 189.61s]  His fleet's been restless these days.
[189.61s -> 192.61s]  That's another guy. It comes from the same guy.
[192.61s -> 194.61s]  That guy just...
[196.61s -> 198.61s]  Oh, let me just be in mid-conversation.
[198.61s -> 203.61s]  Eating an apple while I walk by eating an apple.
[209.15s -> 212.52s]  No, this fucking alligator is so stupid.
[212.52s -> 215.52s]  There's no reason for this to be in the game.
[215.52s -> 218.52s]  There's just one alligator.
[218.52s -> 222.40s]  Okay, now the alligator doesn't go in the water?
[222.40s -> 225.66s]  It's just a sand alligator.
[225.66s -> 228.66s]  He's afraid of the water. That doesn't make any sense.
[228.66s -> 232.86s]  You think you're a big man, don't you?
[232.86s -> 234.86s]  Yeah, you really do. You stare at you.
[234.86s -> 236.86s]  Stare at my eyes.
[236.86s -> 239.23s]  Yeah, you ain't nothing.
[239.23s -> 241.41s]  I'm not gonna look away.
[241.41s -> 245.06s]  You're gonna look away first.
[245.06s -> 247.30s]  Are you really all just afraid of the water?
[247.30s -> 250.30s]  Except for the pitching monkey. He's not afraid.
[250.30s -> 252.92s]  Well, he kind of is afraid.
[252.92s -> 256.25s]  I tricked him.
[260.43s -> 264.43s]  You see, I'm the smart one. I'm the man.
[264.43s -> 266.43s]  I am the human.
[266.43s -> 269.43s]  You're scared of the water, so I put you in the water.
[269.43s -> 271.43s]  So you're afraid to come out.
[272.43s -> 274.80s]  Stupid animals.
[274.80s -> 278.04s]  That's why we will always reign as humans.
[284.98s -> 293.96s]  God, right now we are standing in the temple of Osiris.
[293.96s -> 297.96s]  And I can tell you right now, guys, I'm a little excited as an anthropologist and an archaeologist.
[297.96s -> 300.96s]  I have been waiting for this day for a long time.
[300.96s -> 303.96s]  I'm a little nervous. I can't wait. My whole life has been dedicated to this.
[303.96s -> 305.96s]  I can't wait to give it a try.
[305.96s -> 307.96s]  Getting a little too excited.
[307.96s -> 310.20s]  Getting a little too excited.
[310.20s -> 312.20s]  I don't want this to be a puzzle game. I don't want to do puzzles.
[312.20s -> 314.38s]  I don't want to do a puzzle.
[314.38s -> 319.61s]  All right. Is this where I'm supposed to go?
[319.61s -> 322.61s]  I think so. I've got to drop down.
[322.61s -> 325.98s]  This is one of those games where you have to find the place to drop down.
[325.98s -> 327.98s]  This is it. Right here.
[327.98s -> 336.04s]  Specific amount of damage.
[336.04s -> 338.34s]  Hold on. How much damage is that?
[338.34s -> 340.34s]  One, two, three.
[340.34s -> 342.34s]  One, two, three.
[342.34s -> 344.34s]  One hundred and seven million damage.
[344.34s -> 349.66s]  That's a fucking shitload.
[349.66s -> 352.73s]  Hold on a second.
[352.73s -> 354.73s]  I've got to make sure there's no traps in here.
[354.73s -> 357.16s]  Okay. I've been fooled before.
[357.16s -> 359.16s]  You know, I've been fooled before.
[359.16s -> 361.66s]  Nothing on the walls.
[361.66s -> 364.22s]  Nothing on the ground.
[364.22s -> 366.22s]  Nothing on the ceiling.
[366.22s -> 368.22s]  I'm pretty sure that that's normal. Nothing.
[368.22s -> 370.22s]  So we're free. I think we're going to be all right.
[370.22s -> 372.22s]  Step on the button and let's go continue our quest.
[372.22s -> 378.15s]  The button kills you.
[378.15s -> 380.15s]  You put in some crocodiles. You put in some pigs.
[380.15s -> 382.15s]  What, a dragon?
[382.15s -> 384.15s]  A dragon is in the game.
[384.15s -> 386.15s]  You're going to put a dragon in the game?
[386.15s -> 395.69s]  A real one?
[395.69s -> 401.18s]  How? Can I?
[401.18s -> 403.18s]  I guess we're going to just slide down this.
[403.18s -> 410.09s]  I wonder how long this is going to take.
[410.09s -> 416.04s]  Is this ever going to end?
[416.04s -> 418.04s]  There probably has to be something at the bottom.
[418.04s -> 420.92s]  I'm using my sword. See, I'm cutting down.
[420.92s -> 422.92s]  What you guys don't understand is I'm cutting down right now.
[422.92s -> 424.92s]  Like this is a cool action movie.
[424.92s -> 428.92s]  I stuck the sword in and it's sliding down like puss in boots.
[428.92s -> 430.92s]  Didn't he do that in that movie?
[430.92s -> 434.57s]  What are some other things we can talk about?
[434.57s -> 438.92s]  This is in fact...
[438.92s -> 440.92s]  No, we're going to pass it.
[440.92s -> 442.92s]  Going right by. I believe that is the last level I was just in.
[442.92s -> 444.92s]  I think. I could be wrong though.
[444.92s -> 447.93s]  I've been wrong before.
[447.93s -> 451.77s]  I see water.
[451.77s -> 453.77s]  Or is that water or is that just terrain texture?
[453.77s -> 455.77s]  I believe that's just terrain texture.
[455.77s -> 457.77s]  At least we're going to land.
[457.77s -> 461.54s]  We've landed.
[461.54s -> 465.13s]  So I'm in no man's land right now.
[465.13s -> 468.20s]  Shit's getting a little weird.
[468.20s -> 470.20s]  I wonder if there's anywhere...
[470.20s -> 472.70s]  Can I go anywhere?
[472.70s -> 474.70s]  Have I unlocked the secrets of humanity by falling down the giant dragon pillar?
[474.70s -> 477.13s]  I believe I have.
[477.13s -> 480.26s]  What's this?
[480.26s -> 485.30s]  What's with this random tree?
[485.30s -> 487.99s]  Who put this random tree here?
[487.99s -> 489.99s]  Alright, Ted.
[489.99s -> 491.99s]  You put a tree in this spot down the lower left.
[491.99s -> 493.99s]  Delete that.
[493.99s -> 497.83s]  Control Z.
[497.83s -> 500.65s]  What the fuck am I?
[500.65s -> 504.04s]  I'm lost.
[504.04s -> 506.22s]  This just got so scary.
[506.22s -> 508.22s]  This really just got scary.
[508.22s -> 512.44s]  There's nothing out here?
[512.44s -> 514.44s]  I should turn back?
[514.44s -> 517.00s]  They have actual text in the game to tell me to turn around.
[517.00s -> 520.65s]  Because I got to the end of the developer's map.
[520.65s -> 522.65s]  There's nothing out here.
[522.65s -> 524.65s]  I should probably turn back.
[524.65s -> 528.55s]  Yeah, turn back to where is the question.
[528.55s -> 532.78s]  If I get the sun, I will get superpowers.
[532.78s -> 534.78s]  I can't imagine anything else what this could be besides the sun.
[534.78s -> 536.78s]  It's the sun.
[536.78s -> 540.62s]  Or is that God?
[540.62s -> 546.50s]  I'm not sure.
[546.50s -> 548.50s]  Entertaining to say the least.
[548.50s -> 556.42s]  You know what this looks like?
[556.42s -> 558.79s]  I'm in a movie theater.
[558.79s -> 561.22s]  I found the secret.
[561.22s -> 565.83s]  Game crashed.
[565.83s -> 567.83s]  It was a big projector.
