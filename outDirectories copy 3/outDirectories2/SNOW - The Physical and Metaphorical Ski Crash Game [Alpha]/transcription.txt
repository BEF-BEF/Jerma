[0.31s -> 14.38s]  Hi everybody, this is Jerma here. We're gonna be playing this early Steam access game called Snow. Looks pretty fun. Let's try. Okay, play.
[14.38s -> 22.31s]  Where's the audio? Why is there no audio in this game?
[22.31s -> 31.74s]  Wait a second. Hold on. This could be the best game ever made.
[31.74s -> 41.50s]  I must have messed up something with the uh, with the audio settings because there are no audio. I'll figure that out. There are no audio. Good job with like talking.
[41.50s -> 44.86s]  Alright, I need to slow down here. I don't want to get like run into a tree.
[44.86s -> 54.94s]  So this game is like touted as the first ever like free to play open world simulator, but it's not free to play yet. That's like the funny thing. What?
[54.94s -> 72.45s]  I need to like reload this game. This could be so good.
[72.45s -> 81.03s]  Ah, oh my game crashed. Alright, I want to spawn at like the summit. We're going, we're going right to the summit.
[81.03s -> 87.10s]  And we're, yeah, I still don't have any audio. Alright, whatever. Let's try to get down to summit.
[87.10s -> 103.31s]  I'm going to destroy myself so bad. Oh God. Oh my God. I'm going too fast.
[103.31s -> 112.94s]  So I was wondering what the most important thing is. In fact, when you're developing a game like this, when you're putting these things together, I want to see what the community had to say.
[112.94s -> 122.30s]  And I came across this. Can you at least bust your balls on a railing? It's not a true snowboarding game if you can't bust your balls on the railing.
[122.30s -> 130.30s]  Busting your balls is one of the experiences of being a freelance snowboarder. Moving further down the discussion, this person says it's an alpha.
[130.30s -> 135.30s]  So things will get implemented over time. You don't know if it's possible or not, but we'll see what happens in a few months.
[135.30s -> 146.30s]  And this guy says alpha state is already almost finished. The basics are there. They either have ball busting on railing action or they don't. Case closed.
[146.30s -> 162.47s]  I'll tell you, the game looks pretty good. Look at the snow and the mountains. It's pretty cool looking, but I mean, there's no audio. I don't have any. Oh, look at that trick. Oh, shit.
[162.47s -> 172.36s]  Oh, wow. Okay. Alright. I got some points for that. That's how you get points. But maybe it's just something going on with my audio settings or something.
[172.36s -> 183.90s]  Anybody else that has this game? Is it my settings? Do you have audio or do I not have audio?
[183.90s -> 192.89s]  What? Alright, that's fine. Look at the music. I'm going to do a backflip. Alright, here we go. And the next thing I go off of, I'm doing a backflip.
[192.89s -> 205.42s]  Doing a legitimate full backflip on the next jump. When I first started playing this, I was falling all over the place. Now I'm not.
[205.42s -> 223.16s]  Here we go. You ready for a full backflip? Full backflip. Here we go. The game crashed. So I've crashed. Like, I can't even get down the mountain.
[223.16s -> 234.16s]  I literally have crashed every single time I've tried to get down the mountain. Let's try this again. I'm going to go the scenic route.
[234.16s -> 247.54s]  Hopefully I can get to the bottom of the mountain before the game crashes. That would be a good thing. This is like the this is a crash. Let's go down here.
[247.54s -> 255.78s]  Let's go down here. I'm going. I'm going to do a backflip. I promise you guys I'll do a backflip. There it is. Oh, can you get the double backflip?
[255.78s -> 267.32s]  Yes. Oh, that was pretty sick. Double backflip. Can we do another double backflip? Nope, we can do one backflip though. I'll take the points.
[267.32s -> 273.50s]  Front flip and no, it crashed again. Fuck. No, no. Why? Why?
[273.50s -> 280.50s]  Dear developers, I want to play your fun little ski game, but I can't. The game seems to crash every two minutes or so, taking any fun away I could be having at all.
[280.50s -> 287.50s]  I understand this is an early access game and it's ongoing in its development, but I think we can all agree that the number one thing you need to work on is implementing busting your balls.
[287.50s -> 294.50s]  Busting your balls on rails action is the quintessential part of any snowboarder's life and ball busting takes precedence over everything else.
[294.50s -> 296.50s]  Signed, Yerba.
