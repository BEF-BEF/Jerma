[207.84s -> 210.48s]  we are
[214.48s -> 216.56s]  pull up the glowing text on the page to
[216.56s -> 224.28s]  begin oh this is stressful to cast
[224.28s -> 226.88s]  their try again I think water is the key
[226.88s -> 229.28s]  to solving this bit of the test not
[229.28s -> 233.84s]  quite sure which spell you were trying
[233.84s -> 235.76s]  to cast their try again the fuck is it
[235.76s -> 238.04s]  not quite sure which spell you were
[238.04s -> 240.76s]  trying to try again I can't I'm why am I
[240.76s -> 242.16s]  looking down at the book to see what it
[242.16s -> 244.40s]  is the book is not there's nothing here
[244.40s -> 249.73s]  it's that's not here why get some water
[249.73s -> 251.85s]  in there it's not full yet get some more
[251.85s -> 255.37s]  water into the fountain you need to keep
[255.37s -> 258.21s]  filling it with water use oh I spilled it
[258.21s -> 260.35s]  oh come on you tell me that's not gonna
[260.35s -> 262.96s]  spill out are you kidding me right now
[262.96s -> 265.56s]  this is just like jello in here
[265.56s -> 270.08s]  what the fuck is going on changing water
[270.08s -> 277.33s]  demon that's keep it up open your book
[277.33s -> 278.99s]  there's things left to do in this
[278.99s -> 294.23s]  chapter I'm stuck right now get up get
[294.23s -> 300.37s]  off of me fuck I'm stuck in my robes you
[300.37s -> 302.53s]  see these like birds these butterflies
[302.53s -> 304.65s]  and I just really can't have a kiss
[304.65s -> 307.61s]  it's back to patrol us I've had a kiss
[307.61s -> 310.93s]  what would have kept it difficult is I've
[310.93s -> 321.73s]  got a kiss I don't have us broke oh well
[321.73s -> 324.45s]  this clock is broken lock needs mending
[324.45s -> 330.33s]  I gotta oh it's all over me oh boy what
[330.33s -> 337.21s]  do I do riparrow oh come on now I get it
[337.21s -> 342.20s]  what the fuck is this nearly there
[342.20s -> 345.40s]  trial number three looks straightforward
[345.40s -> 347.40s]  my guess is you need to make things a
[347.40s -> 353.76s]  bit more balanced big big man making the
[353.76s -> 356.32s]  scorpion smaller won't help making him
[356.32s -> 359.44s]  larger might though that's make the
[359.44s -> 362.89s]  scorpion big I don't want a big big-ass
[363.01s -> 365.65s]  scorpion done it wait it's still
[365.65s -> 367.57s]  growing looks like this trial was a
[367.57s -> 375.56s]  trap hey hey hey I'm in a kiss ready for
[375.56s -> 379.88s]  your next spell turn the page jet okay
[379.88s -> 397.24s]  I'm turning the page I think I busted it
[397.24s -> 402.22s]  I'm pretty sure I broke the book I'm
[402.22s -> 404.26s]  pretty positive the book is all screwed
[404.26s -> 411.13s]  up right now if I hold it come on come
[411.13s -> 414.31s]  on what the fuck is going on the book
[414.35s -> 423.72s]  is messed up book of spells my ass it's
[423.72s -> 425.08s]  all glitched out it was like the
[425.08s -> 428.19s]  calibrate button make sure it's closed
[428.19s -> 430.87s]  with the front cover facing upwards if
[430.87s -> 432.59s]  you towards me right now and your
[432.59s -> 434.67s]  wonder book on screen try moving back a
[434.67s -> 437.11s]  little press the move button when you go
[437.11s -> 446.10s]  off your wonder book I don't even give a
[446.10s -> 448.58s]  shit
