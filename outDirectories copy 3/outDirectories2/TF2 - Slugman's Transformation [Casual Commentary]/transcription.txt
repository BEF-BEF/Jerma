[0.31s -> 22.38s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Pyro with the Degreaser, the Reserve Shooter, and the mailbox that I ripped out of my neighbor's yard.
[22.38s -> 32.82s]  So today guys, what I want to talk about is something important, something that I want to relay to you guys that's been going on in my life recently, and let's just get right into it here.
[32.82s -> 45.99s]  I want to tell you the story about Slugman. If you don't know who Slugman is, Slugman is a guy in his late 20s, maybe potentially early 30s. Not yet though, not yet. Slugman's not 30 years old yet.
[45.99s -> 55.41s]  Don't even say that to him or else he'll get pissed and be depressed. So Slugman is a guy that's a slug. He's a person slug. He's got like a regular human body.
[55.41s -> 68.71s]  He's inside of a snail shell, and he's got those two antennas coming out, and he's like on the ground, like sliding around like a slug. He's Slugman. He's slow. He's very tired all the time. He's not that healthy.
[68.71s -> 77.08s]  He feels like he's kind of lost a step or two. He doesn't feel like he's the same slug that he was five, six, seven years ago, and it gets him down.
[77.08s -> 88.08s]  You know, when you're a slug, life sucks when you're a slug, unless you're Earthworm Jim. And Earthworm Jim isn't even a slug. He's a fucking earthworm, so that's completely different.
[88.08s -> 99.08s]  Earthworms live in the soil, and sometimes they get superhuman super suits, and that's not... that doesn't happen to slugs. Slugman never had a superhuman super suit, and it's kind of depressing.
[99.08s -> 108.08s]  Has there ever been a slug that you've ever thought of or realized that wasn't Gary from SpongeBob that was like a super powered, awesome character?
[108.08s -> 117.08s]  I mean, Gary's a cool character. Gary's a snail. They're still in the same family of black cuspids, or whatever family they happen to be part of, but whatever, regardless.
[117.08s -> 122.32s]  Where am I going with this? What's the point of this video? The point of this video is I'm Slugman.
[122.32s -> 131.56s]  I'm Slugman. I have been Slugman for a very long time, for at least the last year or so. I haven't been very active.
[131.56s -> 143.04s]  I've been letting my illnesses get me down. I've been feeling weak and not like I was years ago, back when I felt great every day, and I changed it.
[143.04s -> 154.47s]  I actually got off my slug ass, got out of the snail shell I was in, slid down the street on my slug ass face, and got to the gym for the first time in months.
[154.47s -> 165.84s]  And I feel better than I have ever felt in the last at least 6 to 12 months. And I've tried. I've tried to go back previously, but it never really clicked.
[165.84s -> 171.84s]  It never really locked into my brain. Hey, this is something that I want to do every day. I want to get out. I want to get active.
[171.84s -> 180.84s]  When I can just say to myself, nah, you know, I'll do that like next week. I'd rather sit down and drink like four sodas and stuff like my face with hamburgers.
[180.84s -> 191.08s]  Oh, that's a great idea. Actually, it's not a great idea. It's not a very good idea at all to just be sitting around like a slugman, not doing any activity.
[191.08s -> 201.26s]  I wasn't doing any physical activity. The only physical activity I was really doing was getting up and walking around from my bathroom to here, my desk,
[201.26s -> 212.56s]  and getting up and going in my car and driving places. Without the aforementioned couple of times that I tried to get back into the gym and try to be healthy, I was a slug.
[212.56s -> 220.98s]  That's all I was doing. And I'm going to take a direct quote here from Benjamin Franklin, who just recently graced us at the Germa Rumble.
[220.98s -> 227.98s]  And he actually said this backstage to Burger Boy because Burger Boy was drinking like two or three milkshakes before he got called down.
[228.98s -> 235.41s]  Burger Boy, everything in moderation, my friend. You shouldn't be doing that five minutes before the competition.
[235.41s -> 239.41s]  And Burger Boy laughed in his face and said, what do you know, Benjamin Franklin?
[239.41s -> 246.41s]  And we all know what happened. Benjamin Franklin kicked his ass within 20 seconds of Burger Boy coming down to the arena.
[246.41s -> 251.03s]  So Benjamin Franklin could have some merit with that quote.
[251.03s -> 256.03s]  And it really just means, guys, not to go crazy with anything.
[256.03s -> 265.21s]  Everything in moderation seriously just means if you're going to do something, if you're going to be unhealthy for a day, then don't be unhealthy the next day.
[265.21s -> 273.75s]  Go be active. Go ride your bike. Go play basketball. Go to the gym. Go do something that's not just sitting down eating hamburgers.
[273.75s -> 278.23s]  And I did this for a long time and I started to feel real bad.
[278.23s -> 287.73s]  And it's my sort of PSA video for you guys. This little commentary here is just find something active that you like to do.
[287.73s -> 290.73s]  Get a couple of your friends together to see if they would like to do it too.
[290.73s -> 294.73s]  Or even at your own house, at least like once or twice a week, just do something.
[294.73s -> 300.73s]  It makes you feel so much better about life in general when you are actively doing something.
[300.73s -> 304.73s]  And I know the last few months it's been hard, at least up here in the Northeast.
[304.73s -> 309.73s]  It's been really cold. And if you live in a really cold climate, it can be pretty difficult.
[309.73s -> 314.73s]  But there are indoor places. There are indoor gyms that you can go to to do sort of different activities.
[314.73s -> 320.73s]  And I highly recommend it because, my God, I feel like a Superman right now.
[320.73s -> 324.73s]  Like Superman away! Like I feel like that right now.
[324.73s -> 328.29s]  And I just can't believe that I ever let it get this far.
[328.29s -> 333.29s]  That I ever took this much time away from doing anything physical, trying to get active.
[333.29s -> 340.70s]  I died for too long. And now I understand what people mean when they say it just piles on top of each other.
[340.70s -> 346.70s]  You don't even realize it's happening until a year goes by, two years goes by, whatever.
[346.70s -> 351.94s]  And you just look at the clock and look at the date and you're like, wait a second, has it really been that long since this?
[351.94s -> 356.12s]  I did that? I understand that now because I did it.
[356.12s -> 358.42s]  But anyways guys, that's going to wrap up the video.
[358.42s -> 360.42s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[360.42s -> 364.86s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
