[4.73s -> 8.73s]  My name is Jean De Baer, one of the Order of the Night's Temples.
[11.73s -> 15.73s]  And this is the bitter winter of 1198. It has been eight years.
[23.67s -> 25.67s]  It will be long before overrun.
[25.67s -> 30.67s]  Ten of them have already breached the crossroads. This is the most important thing to penetrate.
[31.67s -> 32.67s]  Wait, is this us?
[32.67s -> 34.67s]  I think that this is supposed to be both of us.
[35.67s -> 39.04s]  Alright, let's fucking play this dumb game.
[41.04s -> 42.04s]  What?
[43.04s -> 45.04s]  Their story didn't just begin?
[49.04s -> 50.04s]  Fucking God!
[51.04s -> 54.04s]  As for Dems, his is about to begin.
[54.04s -> 59.04s]  But as fate would have it, there is another hero who would be impossible to forget.
[64.04s -> 66.04s]  There's too many people in this game.
[67.04s -> 72.04s]  A priest with pretty tunics. I bet he wields that sword no better than a farmer.
[74.41s -> 75.41s]  Wait, we get to play!
[75.41s -> 76.41s]  Oh my God!
[79.41s -> 81.41s]  I'm scoffed in my ass right now!
[81.41s -> 83.41s]  The Nutella is out of play in this game!
[95.41s -> 96.41s]  I wasn't this good.
[97.41s -> 98.41s]  I was not doing this good.
[99.41s -> 100.41s]  What?
[100.41s -> 101.41s]  Is that you?
[101.41s -> 102.41s]  I don't know.
[102.41s -> 104.41s]  Why is there a Mortal Kombat character here?
[106.03s -> 108.03s]  Different universes?
[109.03s -> 110.03s]  Where am I?
[111.03s -> 112.03s]  What is happening?
[112.03s -> 113.03s]  I died.
[113.03s -> 114.03s]  He's going to kill me.
[119.37s -> 121.37s]  Why are we in separate games?
[122.37s -> 125.37s]  No! No, skip me! Get us out of here!
[126.37s -> 128.37s]  I hit space, you have to hit skip.
[130.37s -> 133.76s]  Okay, you have to do the onscreen prompts.
[135.70s -> 139.89s]  He's going to kill me.
[139.89s -> 141.89s]  Dems is a talented swordsman.
[142.89s -> 147.89s]  Direct D, perform a normal attack, C, counter, co-op, star.
[151.06s -> 152.06s]  Why does it say that?
[153.06s -> 156.06s]  Why is it D, C, why wouldn't it be like A, B, C?
[156.06s -> 157.06s]  Why is it star?
[157.06s -> 159.06s]  No, because you're playing co-op with me.
[159.06s -> 160.06s]  I'm playing co-op with you.
[160.06s -> 161.30s]  Yeah.
[161.30s -> 162.30s]  A lot of weird shit going on.
[162.30s -> 164.30s]  That's performed when I grab an enemy.
[165.30s -> 168.80s]  Gee, that's HML. The low isn't star.
[174.30s -> 175.30s]  That's another character.
[175.30s -> 176.30s]  Do we need a third person?
[176.30s -> 177.30s]  He missed every arrow.
[177.30s -> 179.30s]  Did you see how many arrows he just shot?
[179.30s -> 180.30s]  He missed every one.
[180.30s -> 181.30s]  They didn't even get close.
[181.30s -> 182.30s]  They didn't even get close.
[182.30s -> 183.30s]  They were all in unison.
[183.30s -> 184.30s]  They landed right in front of these guys.
[185.30s -> 188.30s]  Time to earn your pay, dogs.
[189.30s -> 190.30s]  They just missed him.
[193.30s -> 198.36s]  Come on, you're going to do some more work.
[198.36s -> 199.36s]  I'm doing all the work here on the left.
[200.36s -> 201.36s]  Are you dead?
[205.42s -> 206.59s]  Now's our chance.
[206.59s -> 207.59s]  Let's go.
[207.59s -> 209.59s]  I got it right in the mouth.
[211.96s -> 212.96s]  I can't.
[216.33s -> 217.33s]  Did you?
[217.33s -> 219.33s]  I got it right in the face.
[219.33s -> 221.33s]  He just put his hand up and wiped his face.
[223.33s -> 225.76s]  Do you feel like we're these guys on the right?
[225.76s -> 227.76s]  Which characters are we right now?
[227.76s -> 230.76s]  All of your audio is on the left.
[230.76s -> 232.76s]  Mine's all on the right or something.
[233.76s -> 234.76s]  I just ran away.
[235.76s -> 236.76s]  I just got...
[239.58s -> 240.58s]  He just took off.
[241.58s -> 242.58s]  Oh shit, this guy died.
[242.58s -> 243.58s]  I'm out of here.
[244.58s -> 246.65s]  Those guys on the left are dead.
[251.40s -> 252.40s]  That guy got shot with a machine gun.
[253.40s -> 254.70s]  So I can...
[254.70s -> 255.70s]  You step out and...
[256.70s -> 261.02s]  It's inverted.
[261.02s -> 262.02s]  It's inverted.
[262.02s -> 263.02s]  Mine's inverted.
[263.02s -> 266.69s]  Shoot him.
[266.69s -> 267.69s]  Shoot him.
[273.32s -> 274.32s]  What the fuck?
[274.32s -> 275.32s]  That was a bad guy.
[275.32s -> 276.32s]  That was a bad guy.
[276.32s -> 277.32s]  That was a bad guy.
[279.01s -> 284.62s]  It could probably fit us both on the same screen.
[285.62s -> 286.62s]  Not really.
[286.62s -> 287.62s]  It could probably just...
[287.62s -> 290.62s]  We probably could be on one screen right now.
[291.98s -> 292.98s]  Is that an enemy?
[298.62s -> 300.92s]  This is really going to be a headache.
[300.92s -> 301.92s]  This is where we came from.
[301.92s -> 302.92s]  Oh shit.
[302.92s -> 303.92s]  We're going the wrong way.
[309.45s -> 310.45s]  Is this a boss?
[310.45s -> 311.45s]  I guess.
[311.45s -> 313.45s]  Alright, first boss fight.
[313.45s -> 314.45s]  You ready?
[314.45s -> 316.20s]  What's the strategy?
[316.20s -> 318.20s]  Oh, good hit.
[318.20s -> 319.76s]  Alright, just co-op him.
[319.76s -> 320.76s]  You ready?
[320.76s -> 321.76s]  Yeah, just co-op him.
[321.76s -> 322.76s]  Co-op him.
[322.76s -> 325.92s]  Just co-op this guy.
[325.92s -> 326.92s]  Co-op him.
[326.92s -> 327.92s]  Right into the fire.
[331.40s -> 332.40s]  Oh, they got me.
[333.40s -> 334.40s]  Good god, we co-opted.
[334.40s -> 335.40s]  You know how to wield a blade.
[335.40s -> 336.40s]  Yeah, you guys know how to do that.
[336.40s -> 339.40s]  Let's see if you can wield fire half as well.
[340.40s -> 341.40s]  Oh shit, he's a demon.
[342.40s -> 343.90s]  You ready to co-op this guy?
[344.90s -> 361.82s]  Yeah.
[361.82s -> 363.82s]  What a fucking useless enemy.
[364.82s -> 368.68s]  At the behest of his holiness, Pope Innocent III.
[368.68s -> 369.68s]  Pope Innocent.
[369.68s -> 372.68s]  Garin fucking T, that guy's a demon.
[373.68s -> 379.24s]  You don't have a name like Pope Innocent III if you're not the bad guy of the whole game.
[380.24s -> 382.24s]  It's funny because this is all historically accurate.
[382.24s -> 383.24s]  That's probably a real guy.
[385.24s -> 387.24s]  Here's the typical bored king.
[388.24s -> 393.24s]  Eventually, somebody hopes somebody makes me come from my sleep and see these two gentlemen.
[393.24s -> 394.24s]  Oh, look.
[394.24s -> 395.24s]  Do you see how good they did?
[395.24s -> 396.24s]  I'll speak to them now.
[396.24s -> 397.24s]  This game sucks.
[398.24s -> 399.24s]  Uh-oh.
[409.63s -> 411.06s]  Reign is back.
[412.06s -> 422.33s]  Hope he doesn't do a brutality.
[430.96s -> 431.96s]  He's dead.
[431.96s -> 437.62s]  Me too.
[437.62s -> 438.62s]  I'm dead.
[438.62s -> 439.62s]  I'm dead.
[439.62s -> 440.62s]  I'm dead.
[440.62s -> 441.62s]  I'm dead.
[441.62s -> 442.62s]  I'm dead.
[442.62s -> 443.62s]  I'm dead.
[443.62s -> 444.62s]  I'm dead.
[444.62s -> 445.62s]  I'm dead.
[445.62s -> 446.62s]  I'm dead.
[446.62s -> 447.62s]  I'm dead.
[447.62s -> 449.05s]  I'm dead.
[449.05s -> 450.05s]  Let's try the sacred flames.
[451.05s -> 452.05s]  He's dead.
[452.05s -> 453.05s]  No, we have to do the sacred flames.
[454.05s -> 455.05s]  One of us creates a diversion.
[456.05s -> 457.05s]  The other burns him down.
[457.05s -> 458.05s]  No, he's dead.
[458.05s -> 459.05s]  He's gone.
[459.05s -> 460.05s]  We won.
[460.05s -> 461.05s]  What?
[461.05s -> 462.05s]  There was a whole plan.
[463.05s -> 464.05s]  We couldn't even hear the whole plan.
[465.05s -> 466.05s]  We co-opted him too fast.
[466.05s -> 468.05s]  We couldn't even hear the plan.
[469.05s -> 470.05s]  This is not normal.
[471.05s -> 473.05s]  The way they were talking, that wasn't even supposed to happen.
[473.05s -> 476.05s]  It was like, you create a diversion and we'll do a purifying flame.
[477.05s -> 478.05s]  No, he's just dead.
[478.05s -> 479.05s]  I pressed X.
