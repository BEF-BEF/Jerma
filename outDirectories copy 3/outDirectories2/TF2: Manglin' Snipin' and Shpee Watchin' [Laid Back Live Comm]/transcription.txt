[0.31s -> 13.26s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with kind of a different video today.
[13.26s -> 19.68s]  Oh, not really different, but a little bit different than what you've been used to the last few months of the content of my
[20.54s -> 24.18s]  Channel. What is going on with this? What is going on with this guy?
[27.15s -> 32.47s]  And what I mean by that, sorry, I was interrupted there, is this is gonna be just a laid-back live commentary.
[32.47s -> 36.23s]  I haven't done one of these in a long time, and I feel like it's kind of overdue.
[36.51s -> 40.27s]  A lot of the stuff on my channel lately has been, hold on, see if I can get this off, I'll pull this off.
[40.95s -> 43.98s]  Dammit, almost, that was close, oh well.
[44.26s -> 49.10s]  But a lot of the content on my channel lately has been like wacky and crazy, and that's like, that's who I am.
[49.30s -> 53.86s]  But I also want to do more stuff like this, where I just kind of hang out, talk to you guys about anything really, and
[54.14s -> 58.82s]  play some video games. And today we're playing TF2, playing as the cow mangler, as you can see.
[58.82s -> 62.38s]  And I'm going to get that sentry gun. I'm gonna get it.
[62.38s -> 67.65s]  I'm gonna use the strategy where you shoot it, you right-click it, and then you kill it with a shotgun.
[67.77s -> 70.39s]  Or this guy will just uber it, we'll see.
[71.15s -> 72.35s]  There's a-
[72.35s -> 74.27s]  Ooh, ooh.
[74.27s -> 75.87s]  Gotta kill the engineer.
[75.87s -> 78.67s]  There we go. Okay, good, good, good. So, what?
[79.23s -> 85.39s]  What? Looks like there could be one or two. Let's shoot that over there, get rid of this.
[86.15s -> 91.30s]  Bang. Yep. All right, we're gonna try the shotgun strategy.
[91.30s -> 97.09s]  I'm gonna try the shotgun strategy again, the cow mangler, and then shotgun. Sentry's right around this corner.
[97.37s -> 103.54s]  Let's see if I can do this. Where is it? I need to know where it is. There it is. Okay, here we go.
[103.54s -> 110.74s]  Ready? Shotgun strat. Three, four. There it is.
[111.10s -> 115.54s]  Oh, at least I got the sentry gun. So it works. It does work.
[115.82s -> 119.94s]  It's fun to do as well. Sometimes if you're running straight at a sentry like that,
[120.10s -> 125.06s]  and you charge up the cow mangler and you sprint at it, it's pretty intense, especially if there's an engineer nearby.
[125.06s -> 130.74s]  It's really fun. What? That didn't even hit him with anything.
[131.50s -> 144.40s]  Knew he was low on health because he wouldn't have ran away. Hi. Oh, he got me.
[145.56s -> 154.93s]  Which one am I gonna use? Should I use knife? Should I use gun? Should I use knife? Should I use gun? Knife? Gun? Knife?
[155.09s -> 157.49s]  Gun? Knife? I don't know. Gun? Knife?
[161.07s -> 167.85s]  Oh boy. This is what I'm talking about here. This is what I'm talking about. That's what I want. Come on, spy.
[167.85s -> 173.65s]  Do you do your work? Oh, yeah, that's what we call teamwork. That was teamwork for sure.
[173.65s -> 181.74s]  I wouldn't have gotten there in time, and that spy did a hell of a lot of good things, and this spy
[183.02s -> 192.60s]  is being a real son of a bitch. Be careful. Get full health. Let me get full health and full mana.
[192.72s -> 202.73s]  You know, a lot of people forget this is a window. I always forget that.
[202.73s -> 206.22s]  I always think it's like, oh, they can only that I can only see them in one place.
[206.22s -> 207.82s]  That means they're gonna come from one place.
[207.82s -> 215.91s]  It's a window right there that you can shoot through. People are like hiding. Damn.
[219.98s -> 230.58s]  Oh boy. There they go. Keep it rolling, boys. Keep it rolling. That's what I like to see. We're gonna win.
[230.58s -> 238.26s]  I think we're actually gonna do it. I missed it. It's okay.
[241.65s -> 255.39s]  Distracted. Distraction. Nice job. Need some help here.
[255.79s -> 265.05s]  There's a sniper up there. I know he's there. What? What?
[271.59s -> 273.94s]  What? What just happened?
[274.66s -> 276.66s]  He was like on an invisible platform.
[277.46s -> 285.79s]  You guys saw that? That was that just like ultra lag for that guy? And what is this guy doing?
[286.11s -> 296.02s]  There's a spy. I need to see that spy. Hold on. I don't even care if I'm burning. That's spy. Where'd he go?
[296.22s -> 300.90s]  He's over here somewhere. No, no, don't kill him.
[301.30s -> 309.78s]  Dude, that was... somebody play the Benny Hill theme song.
[313.78s -> 321.94s]  That was amazing. I loved every single second of that. There's another sniper on this team. That's really good.
[322.30s -> 326.42s]  I'm trying to find him because I know he's gonna kill me over and over again.
[328.15s -> 330.65s]  Get... please.
[330.73s -> 338.12s]  Thank you. Is that him? That's him. He's good. This guy's good. This guy knows what he's doing.
[338.32s -> 342.56s]  Ooh.
[342.56s -> 351.66s]  Refill. Get a little bit of a refill. That guy was standing in the same spot again. And his buddy. Got you both.
[351.82s -> 359.38s]  Be careful next time. Watch yourself. Missed that headshot. Don't know how. That guy burned.
[359.38s -> 364.20s]  I could probably take out this sentry gun. I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[366.67s -> 370.38s]  Ah, shit!
[371.70s -> 380.53s]  We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We have seven snipers.
[382.39s -> 388.46s]  That's a little ridiculous. That is just a little bit ridiculous.
[388.62s -> 396.86s]  You know, I always thought that when a Spie became an adult spy, they, uh...
[397.42s -> 401.61s]  they kind of grew up a little bit and stopped acting kind of like crazy.
[401.61s -> 413.30s]  I don't think that's true anymore. I was like disguising as an engineer. Not entirely sure why. Oh, that's uh...
[414.26s -> 424.79s]  Another one? What the hell is going on? What does he do? What is this guy doing?
[425.35s -> 427.78s]  He was just like crouching in the middle.
[430.66s -> 435.20s]  This guy is great.
[436.64s -> 448.89s]  That was a good like strat. Just like crouch in the middle. Oh dear. Oh, it's your toast. I'm gonna get you now.
[448.89s -> 454.14s]  Oh, I'm not. That just scared the hell out of me. That whole group of people,
[454.14s -> 465.94s]  I got like stage fright. Get on the cart. Get on the cart. Get on the cart.
[466.14s -> 473.60s]  We need to get on the cart. So badly. They have so many defenses, like we have to get on here.
[473.88s -> 483.39s]  There's like a thousand different defenses. And he's dead. Nice job. All right. Well, that's probably gonna wrap it up here guys.
[483.39s -> 490.70s]  Um, but this is the last life. This'll be the last life. Shit. I didn't time that right. Wee!
[491.34s -> 500.58s]  Oh, get me away from you guys. Nudist guys. All right. Well, sorry.
[500.58s -> 503.78s]  I was like just like talking and I lost my train of thought because like that nonsense.
[503.94s -> 509.62s]  But I'll see you guys all next time. Thank you so much for watching. Take care everybody, of course. And I'll see you all
[510.26s -> 514.08s]  next time.
[514.08s -> 521.46s]  I don't know like when to go for the stab. How did I get that? That was a chaos stab if I've ever seen one.
