[0.89s -> 5.37s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[5.37s -> 10.33s]  Got a couple of things in this video. This is gonna be a Spicycle one-life gameplay.
[10.33s -> 15.94s]  Gonna show you two lives though. The first one's gonna be with the Default Invisibility Watch,
[15.94s -> 21.70s]  and the second one's gonna be with the Dead Ringer, and in between I've got a crazy Demoman thing
[21.70s -> 26.82s]  that I did. So the intermission between the two one-life gameplays is gonna be something I'm
[26.82s -> 34.33s]  coining right now. The most destruction I've ever done as a Demoman. Period. Comma. Quotation
[34.33s -> 40.01s]  marks. So stick around, we've got some things to talk about, especially about this knife.
[40.01s -> 43.93s]  So let me get you the loadout for the match. The loadout is gonna be the Spicycle, obviously,
[43.93s -> 49.61s]  get this nice sap and stab on that engineer. The Spicycle. The Diamondback. Now I know,
[49.61s -> 53.93s]  hear me out on this one. The Diamondback and, of course, the Default Invisibility Watch.
[53.93s -> 58.26s]  So I get a couple of kills with the Diamondback. I feel like the Diamondback is very,
[58.26s -> 61.94s]  very underused when it comes to spies. A lot of spies would just rather say,
[61.94s -> 66.18s]  why don't you just put on the Ambassador? And I'd say, well, because I can get guaranteed
[66.18s -> 72.55s]  critical shots like this right here. Miss. Don't miss. But with this gun, you don't have to shoot
[72.55s -> 77.19s]  somebody in their face to get a crit. All you have to do is destroy one little building,
[77.19s -> 81.11s]  it could be a teleporter, it doesn't matter, dispenser, anything, and you'll get a guaranteed
[81.11s -> 86.71s]  crit. The reason why I would say to use this is because I've found in so many situations,
[87.27s -> 92.15s]  I've been backing up with the Ambassador, trying to headshot somebody that's coming after me,
[92.15s -> 96.95s]  and I just miss, no, hold on, I got it, miss, no, I can get it, and you just miss over and over again.
[96.95s -> 100.87s]  With this thing, you just have to land a body shot and you'll crit them. And they both do the
[100.87s -> 105.91s]  same amount of damage. They both crit for 102. So if you're having trouble aiming at heads with
[105.91s -> 110.81s]  the Ambassador, try the Diamondback. Unless, of course, there are no engineers on the other
[110.81s -> 115.61s]  team. If there's zero engineers on the other team, you're just taking a 15% damage penalty,
[115.61s -> 120.98s]  that's all you're doing. So enough about the Diamondback, let's talk about the Spicycle.
[120.98s -> 125.62s]  So this knife is pretty close to taking over all the other knives and being the best one in the
[125.62s -> 129.94s]  game. Now there are plenty of downsides, of course, as you'll see here when I stab somebody,
[129.94s -> 134.58s]  they turn into an ice sculpture. And that's a huge dead giveaway that you're around, and of course,
[134.58s -> 140.02s]  if you get sprayed by a Pyro, you lose the knife for 15 seconds. But the really good thing about
[140.02s -> 145.22s]  this knife, it's the only other one in the game that shares the same attributes as the default.
[145.22s -> 149.54s]  There's no crazy health mechanic or no weird stabbing mechanic, which is something I really,
[149.54s -> 155.14s]  really like about the knife. And now let's talk about Pyros for a second. Pyros are the number
[155.14s -> 162.04s]  one counter to a Spy. And with this knife, they're no longer your counter. You'll see so many times
[162.04s -> 166.92s]  in these couple clips where I get sprayed by a Pyro and nothing happens and the Pyro just goes
[166.92s -> 173.32s]  on his merry way. That is a huge, huge upgrade, insane upgrade, because now you don't have to
[173.32s -> 179.43s]  worry about Pyros. If you have this knife out, you completely negate your counter. So here comes the
[179.43s -> 183.91s]  end of this particular run. Got a bunch of kills, got a bunch of saps on Sentries. Pretty decent,
[183.91s -> 188.71s]  but now I want to go to a Demoman clip, just because I have to put it in here, use it as an
[188.71s -> 193.19s]  intermission. So I have the default sticky launcher, the default grenade launcher, and I think the
[193.19s -> 197.91s]  frying pan, but none of that really matters. Watch what happens here in a second. I get an uber charge,
[197.91s -> 202.95s]  and over on the left, if this is not a great example of why you should never build close to
[202.95s -> 207.35s]  each other as an engineer, then I don't know what is. Look at this. Look at all this stuff,
[207.35s -> 213.43s]  all these buildings. Goodbye. Everything and everyone over there is dead or destroyed. I'm
[213.43s -> 217.98s]  going to do a slow-mo for you. I want to count. Let's count together. Ready? So it looks like
[217.98s -> 224.31s]  one, two, three, four, five buildings and like four people. So I just thought that was insane.
[224.31s -> 228.31s]  Had to put that in here for a little intermission, because I've never done something like that before.
[228.31s -> 232.87s]  So moving right along here, this is the second Spy gameplay using the Dead Ringer instead of
[232.87s -> 238.63s]  the Invisibility Watch. I also have on the Letronjo or the La Torenga, however you want to pronounce
[238.63s -> 244.47s]  that pistol. So I come up here, get this Pyro, and I want to explain why the Dead Ringer is a great
[244.47s -> 249.35s]  option with this new knife. So pretty much the reason why you use these two things together is
[249.35s -> 254.47s]  because it allows you to escape more than once. How many times have you been a Spy and gotten
[254.47s -> 259.51s]  sprayed by a Pyro and then sprayed immediately after pulling out the Dead Ringer? Say goodbye
[259.51s -> 264.79s]  to that ever happening ever again by using these two together. Pretty much what you can do now is
[264.79s -> 269.43s]  you can take out the knife when you get sprayed, and it's sort of the first Dead Ringer. You get
[269.43s -> 275.03s]  two Dead Ringers now, and then when you actually really need to use your real Dead Ringer, you pull
[275.03s -> 279.83s]  it out. So you get two second chances, I guess, rather than one second chance, if that makes any
[279.83s -> 284.87s]  sense. Now which one of these would I rather play with, the Dead Ringer or the Invisibility Watch?
[284.87s -> 289.62s]  Kind of a tough question, because they're both very, very good. It just depends on your play style.
[289.62s -> 294.26s]  Something very, very important that I really need to bring up is make sure you do not have the knife
[294.26s -> 300.26s]  up and the Dead Ringer up at the same time. If a Pyro sprays you, it's going to use your knife and
[300.26s -> 304.42s]  the Dead Ringer. So be very, very careful in those situations. You want to make sure you have your
[304.42s -> 308.42s]  pistol out. If you see a Pyro, pull out something else rather than the knife, like the Sapper or
[308.42s -> 312.82s]  the pistol. Get sprayed with the knife out, and then you can go on your way and use the Dead Ringer.
[312.82s -> 316.10s]  It's happened to me a couple of times. I'm still trying to get used to it, where I'm walking around
[316.10s -> 320.02s]  with the knife. I get sprayed and I have the Dead Ringer out, and it's like, whoa, what just happened?
[320.02s -> 325.29s]  I lost everything. Just be careful. That's all I'm saying. Be careful. And I'll just talk about the
[325.29s -> 329.37s]  entertainment value of this knife. It doesn't matter if it's with the Dead Ringer or with the
[329.37s -> 334.81s]  Invisibility Watch. The entertainment value is awesome. It's so much fun, because this knife
[334.81s -> 341.05s]  allows you to be a real master of disguise and master of deceit. Because when you get sprayed
[341.05s -> 345.85s]  and you don't light on fire, you kind of have to play the role and kind of look at them and be like,
[345.85s -> 352.25s]  ah, dude, I'm not a spy. Screw you. Excuse me. And it really does add another layer to the
[352.25s -> 357.93s]  meta game as a spy. You could go an entire round as the spy, not even killing anybody,
[357.93s -> 362.17s]  but just trying to blend in with the other team. I've seen people do that before. I've seen funny
[362.17s -> 366.73s]  videos where people just troll the other team, and they just put a disguise on, and they pretend to
[366.73s -> 370.81s]  be like an engineer or something, and it's actually kind of funny. So it makes it a whole lot easier
[370.81s -> 375.58s]  to blend in now, and it makes it a whole lot more fun, too. So we are coming up here to the end of
[375.58s -> 380.14s]  the video. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. I get myself killed by
[380.14s -> 386.38s]  a Crusaders crossbow medic, and I think that's only happened like two or three times since that item
[386.38s -> 392.15s]  released. So thumbs up to that guy. Actually, I love that weapon. I could talk about that weapon
[392.15s -> 397.51s]  for a while, but that's for a different commentary. So I come back here. I believe I kill a heavy,
[397.51s -> 401.67s]  and my demise is I didn't do this in the right order. I should have sapped that little mini
[401.67s -> 406.71s]  century first, but I didn't do that. 2020 hindsight, you know. But yeah, thank you all
[406.71s -> 410.87s]  so much for watching. I'll see you all next time. Take care, everybody.
