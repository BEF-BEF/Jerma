[2.04s -> 7.64s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a pre-thanksgiving live commentary.
[7.64s -> 12.44s]  I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, if you celebrate Thanksgiving, if you live in the
[12.44s -> 17.08s]  United States, or if you are overseas somewhere but you still happen to celebrate Thanksgiving,
[17.08s -> 20.44s]  then happy Thanksgiving. I hope you have a nice safe holiday everybody.
[20.44s -> 23.74s]  Gonna do a quick live commentary like I'm saying. Oh goodness.
[25.90s -> 29.59s]  I thought I was gonna kill him. But yeah, happy Thanksgiving.
[29.67s -> 35.03s]  And I got some crazy crazy things planned for the holiday season. Not gonna tell you
[35.03s -> 40.15s]  what I'm doing yet. It's involving a lot of insanity. I'll get into that in a later video,
[40.15s -> 45.77s]  but expect a crazy Christmas video at some point in the very near future.
[45.77s -> 53.98s]  So what do you say? Let's get C. Let's get C. Playing as the pyro with the reserve shooter
[54.70s -> 61.24s]  and the degreaser along with the power jack. Pretty much default setup for me.
[61.24s -> 64.36s]  Except the reserve shooter. I don't really use it a whole lot. Oh, I was trying to sneak
[64.36s -> 70.15s]  behind everybody. What the hell was I doing? I like ran. I was talking and just ran around
[70.15s -> 78.55s]  everybody like an idiot. But yeah, I'm gonna fill up on so much turkey. I'm gonna eat a
[78.55s -> 84.60s]  ton of turkey sandwiches the next day. Should be a hell of a good time. Me and my family,
[84.60s -> 90.17s]  we go up to New Hampshire. And when we go there, we get a big hall rented out, like a big hall is
[90.17s -> 95.61s]  rented out for us. A ton of our family goes there every year. It's pretty cool. Pretty interesting.
[95.61s -> 101.37s]  I got a big family, guys. So we can't really have Christmas and like Thanksgiving at one little
[101.37s -> 107.82s]  place just because the family is so enormous. I want to get Oh, man. Oh, this could be epic
[107.82s -> 113.90s]  right here. This could be epic. Get out of here. I don't want you up here. Oh, there's a tree up
[113.90s -> 122.46s]  here. Oh, I should have known. I should have known. That's what I get. You know, I'm going
[122.46s -> 130.58s]  to change to demo man because that's just not going to happen as a pyro. Give me my... There we
[130.58s -> 136.58s]  go. All right. I'll do this right here. Ready? You guys ready? If I don't do this right here,
[136.58s -> 145.05s]  then something's wrong. Okay. I got to go the other way. Oh, no, no, no. Got to go around the
[145.05s -> 155.51s]  other direction. Here we go. Who'd I get? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I mean, they're all like pouring
[155.51s -> 171.05s]  in here. Oh, come on now. Come on now. How did that not hit him? I was going to say, Jesus.
[172.20s -> 189.29s]  Jesus, criminy. I need a medic. Oh, Chris Krieg, look out. I'm dead. I'm so dead. Where did these
[189.29s -> 196.68s]  guys all come from? They're all just pouring into this one area. No, we have two medics. What's
[196.76s -> 206.84s]  going on here? What is the deal? This is gravel pit if you did not know. If you were unaware
[207.48s -> 217.90s]  of where we were playing. Where we were playing, not where we were playing. Oh, come on. At least
[217.90s -> 228.71s]  I got the teleporter. That's one thing. That's one good thing. All right. If I can get even close to
[228.71s -> 239.45s]  that and I could, I could probably get something done. I just need to overheal. Big time. Oh, no.
[239.93s -> 250.55s]  Demoman. Got him. All right. This is just, we have two medics. Where are they?
[251.19s -> 255.02s]  Where are these two mysterious medics that just are nowhere to be found?
[255.58s -> 267.26s]  Somebody's on the point. Oh, we might win. Come on. I'm just going to jump up there.
[269.69s -> 293.02s]  No. Oh, that was great. I just launched like 10,000 feet in the air. God. Jeez. Spy. No,
[293.02s -> 306.52s]  we can't lose. Oh, get him. Nice shot. What? Oh, where is this medic? I haven't seen the
[306.52s -> 319.22s]  medic one time. Where is this guy? I'm going this way. I'm not going that way. I'm going to get
[319.22s -> 334.02s]  myself killed. Oh, did I make it? I did, but not really. I was just completely silent right there.
[334.02s -> 339.46s]  That was just try hard mode. Wicked bad. Too bad it didn't work. We're definitely going to lose.
[339.46s -> 347.11s]  This is it. That's all she wrote. So yeah, thank you guys. So look at this. What?
[348.36s -> 356.60s]  What is going on here? Anyways, we lose, but thanks everybody so much for watching.
[356.60s -> 361.16s]  I wanted to make this quick video just to get it out here and wish you guys a happy Thanksgiving.
[361.16s -> 366.44s]  And I wish you the best and stay safe, guys. Take care, everybody.
