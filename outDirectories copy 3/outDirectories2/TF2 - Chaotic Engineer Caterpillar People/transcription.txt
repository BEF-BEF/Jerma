[0.31s -> 12.99s]  This is so dumb. This is the dumbest thing ever. I love it.
[12.99s -> 18.47s]  Alright, are we ready to play Red Light Green Light?
[18.47s -> 20.47s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, stop.
[20.47s -> 23.16s]  So turn around. Come over here.
[23.16s -> 26.40s]  And green light. Red light!
[26.40s -> 30.12s]  This guy right in the-
[30.12s -> 34.48s]  No! You're not supposed to taunt kill!
[34.48s -> 38.84s]  Look at all these.
[38.84s -> 43.97s]  So both of you guys stand over there. Make sure your sentry does not fire.
[43.97s -> 48.00s]  Make sure-
[49.00s -> 51.00s]  Be careful you don't fall off.
[51.00s -> 53.00s]  Look at that guy just did.
[53.00s -> 55.00s]  Oh man.
[55.00s -> 61.00s]  It's going to be very difficult to upgrade them because they're just going to start firing.
[61.00s -> 67.87s]  If you can get it, if you're confident you can get it built to level 3, then try.
[67.87s -> 69.87s]  But try not to kill anybody.
[69.87s -> 75.87s]  Oh dear. Oh dear. It's chaos. It's chaos. Somebody died.
[75.87s -> 77.87s]  Abandoned mission. Abort mission.
[77.87s -> 79.87s]  Abort mission.
[91.29s -> 93.29s]  What's happening?
[93.29s -> 96.62s]  Dude, this is insanity.
[96.62s -> 99.62s]  Well, okay, so I think we found a problem.
[99.62s -> 107.58s]  If one person dies, then it all goes to hell.
[107.58s -> 109.58s]  Everybody point your laser beam.
[109.58s -> 113.58s]  Let's go with the guy in the green hat first because he's standing up there.
[113.58s -> 115.58s]  Everybody point your laser. The friendly fire is on.
[115.58s -> 118.14s]  Everybody point your laser at him.
[118.14s -> 122.76s]  I want you to uber him and then everybody unload on this guy.
[122.76s -> 125.71s]  So are we all ready?
[125.71s -> 135.34s]  Yeah, on the count of three, uber him and then once he's ubered everybody just start annihilating him.
[135.34s -> 136.34s]  Ready?
[136.34s -> 140.28s]  Three, two, one, uber.
[140.28s -> 145.32s]  Get him.
[145.32s -> 147.32s]  He's getting pushed back.
[150.32s -> 152.32s]  Is he still alive?
[152.32s -> 157.40s]  Alright, hold your fire. Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
[157.40s -> 159.40s]  Hold your fire. Oh no.
[162.34s -> 164.34s]  Here comes the cottage.
[164.34s -> 166.34s]  Here comes the cottage.
[171.01s -> 175.94s]  This server is going to break.
[175.94s -> 181.76s]  Alright, so what we have created here, it looks almost like, it's like a caterpillar.
[181.76s -> 183.76s]  We've made an NG caterpillar.
[183.76s -> 190.00s]  This is actually like very, this is like very pretty.
[190.00s -> 195.00s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[195.00s -> 199.60s]  Bang, right there.
[199.60s -> 201.60s]  Make sure you got that Wrangler on.
[201.60s -> 202.60s]  Everybody get on top.
[202.60s -> 204.60s]  Let's hope it works this time.
[204.60s -> 207.03s]  Our beautiful centipede.
[207.03s -> 210.03s]  Our wonderfully beautiful engineer centipede that we've made.
[210.03s -> 214.16s]  And I want, everybody just move your, do a laser light show.
[214.16s -> 216.16s]  I want to see what it looks like. Just spin around everywhere.
[222.30s -> 228.04s]  Everybody spread out a lot.
[228.04s -> 230.48s]  That's good, that's good.
[230.48s -> 232.48s]  Everyone spread out a lot and then everyone aim at the ear.
[232.48s -> 238.64s]  And at the same time, count to three, everybody right click.
[238.64s -> 241.07s]  And let's just see what happens. Ready?
[241.07s -> 244.72s]  Three, two, one, click.
[244.72s -> 246.72s]  Alright, let's see what happens. Oh god.
[246.72s -> 250.60s]  Only one person.
[250.60s -> 252.60s]  This guy right here is the only guy.
[252.60s -> 254.60s]  That guy hit by one.
[254.60s -> 256.60s]  And look at how long he's stunned.
[256.60s -> 259.60s]  Wow, I did not expect that.
[259.60s -> 265.86s]  And three, two, one, go.
[265.86s -> 270.21s]  Yay, it's like fireworks.
[270.21s -> 274.31s]  Was it the same guy?
[274.31s -> 275.31s]  Blue pyro.
[275.31s -> 277.48s]  You should probably get over to the blue pyro side.
[277.48s -> 279.48s]  This is the red territory.
[279.48s -> 281.98s]  This is red territory.
[281.98s -> 288.27s]  Alright, get on, blue pyro's go, blue pyro's go on the blue side.
[288.27s -> 290.57s]  Red pyro's on red side.
[290.57s -> 293.39s]  This is not going to work.
[293.39s -> 295.39s]  This is not going to work. Oh my god.
[295.39s -> 297.69s]  Holy shit.
[297.69s -> 303.77s]  You are the scariest person I've ever seen in my life.
[303.77s -> 307.04s]  That is outrageous.
[307.04s -> 309.04s]  Okay, you just, you just, I have nightmares.
[309.04s -> 312.04s]  I'm going to have nightmares tonight because of that face.
[312.04s -> 314.40s]  Alright, you guys ready?
[314.40s -> 316.71s]  Only air blast, only air blast.
[316.71s -> 318.71s]  And whoever wins, wins.
[318.71s -> 321.78s]  This one blue pyro, get out of here, man.
[321.78s -> 324.15s]  You gotta get on the blue side.
[324.15s -> 327.35s]  Ready? Here we go.
[327.35s -> 329.59s]  In three, two, one.
[329.59s -> 335.08s]  Charge!
[335.08s -> 337.08s]  No, no, who used fire?
[337.08s -> 339.08s]  Somebody used flames.
