[0.31s -> 15.26s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with chapter 2 of Sea of Her Meat Boy.
[15.26s -> 17.26s]  Gonna tackle the hospital.
[17.26s -> 23.26s]  Now welcome back if you just watched the first episode where I took on chapter 1, which proceeds chapter 2.
[23.26s -> 25.50s]  So here we go, the hospital.
[25.50s -> 31.50s]  A place that I don't like to go, cause that means you're hurt, or have some type of injury or illness.
[31.50s -> 36.65s]  Alright, where's my boy Commander Video? There he is.
[37.15s -> 39.15s]  All his glorious rainbows intact.
[39.15s -> 42.03s]  So I hope you're having a fantastic day.
[42.03s -> 46.03s]  I know Commander Video is cause he's gonna speedrun this whole level.
[46.03s -> 49.23s]  Woo!
[49.23s -> 51.23s]  Let's get A pluses on every level.
[51.23s -> 53.85s]  I forget these levels.
[53.85s -> 56.03s]  It's been a while.
[56.03s -> 59.03s]  Not long enough where I can't absolutely ace them though.
[59.03s -> 64.16s]  And that's how you do it right there folks.
[64.16s -> 66.40s]  No A plus, but that's okay.
[66.40s -> 71.16s]  Oh, I was also told to turn the music up a little bit, so I did.
[71.16s -> 73.16s]  Turn it up if you can hear it.
[73.16s -> 75.16s]  This is gonna be tough.
[75.16s -> 77.97s]  You might need Meat Boy for this one.
[77.97s -> 80.45s]  Maybe not.
[80.45s -> 82.45s]  Ooh, that's slick. Ooh, that is slick.
[87.36s -> 89.60s]  Slick. No, no!
[89.60s -> 91.60s]  I gotta stop trying to be like a slick Rick.
[91.60s -> 93.60s]  Just play the damn game.
[93.60s -> 97.75s]  Here we are.
[97.75s -> 100.18s]  It's all about moving fast. Just forget about everything, just go.
[100.18s -> 102.18s]  Here we are.
[102.18s -> 105.06s]  A plus.
[105.06s -> 109.84s]  And this is one of the things where you fly in the air.
[109.84s -> 113.23s]  Let's do it again.
[113.23s -> 116.17s]  Oh, I didn't hold down jump.
[116.17s -> 118.86s]  So that's the thing with Commander Video.
[118.86s -> 121.10s]  You gotta make sure.
[121.10s -> 125.10s]  In situations like this, you don't hold down jump for too long.
[125.10s -> 127.10s]  Stuff like that will happen.
[127.10s -> 130.88s]  Let's take this slow right now.
[130.88s -> 134.65s]  Ah!
[134.65s -> 136.65s]  This might be...I don't know if I can do this with Commander Video.
[136.65s -> 140.35s]  Don't!
[140.35s -> 142.35s]  But I wanna stay with Commander Video. I love him.
[142.35s -> 144.97s]  No, you know what? I can get this.
[144.97s -> 147.40s]  Ready? Here we go.
[147.40s -> 150.54s]  One, two, three.
[150.54s -> 152.54s]  Oh, you bastard! Last try, come on.
[152.54s -> 156.81s]  Ugh!
[156.81s -> 158.81s]  I'm gonna have to switch.
[158.81s -> 161.31s]  Sorry, Commander Video. I wanted to do the whole thing with you.
[161.31s -> 163.31s]  Do I give up that easily? I don't.
[163.31s -> 167.07s]  So let's try it again.
[167.07s -> 170.32s]  Let's try it again.
[170.32s -> 172.75s]  Alright, meat boy.
[172.75s -> 176.01s]  Didn't want to have to resort to using you, but I have to.
[176.01s -> 179.21s]  God, I'm so not used to him.
[179.21s -> 182.22s]  Let's clean this up.
[182.22s -> 185.23s]  Come on, just do it.
[185.23s -> 188.49s]  Oh, god!
[188.49s -> 191.24s]  Okay.
[191.24s -> 194.00s]  Alright, we're good.
[194.00s -> 196.62s]  That almost just not gonna work.
[196.62s -> 198.62s]  I'm gonna have to do this again with Super Meat Boy.
[198.62s -> 202.65s]  Because he moves faster.
[202.65s -> 204.65s]  I'm gonna have to...I don't know about this one.
[204.65s -> 207.96s]  Oh, Band-Aid.
[207.96s -> 210.65s]  Give me that Band-Aid!
[210.65s -> 213.72s]  I said...
[213.72s -> 215.72s]  Oh, here come the swears.
[215.72s -> 220.12s]  Forget the Band-Aid, let's go.
[220.12s -> 222.88s]  Alright, come on.
[222.88s -> 227.93s]  Oh, that's how you skip that whole part.
[227.93s -> 229.93s]  Alright, now I can probably switch to Commander Video and be okay with it.
[229.93s -> 232.88s]  The question is, do I want to skip this?
[232.88s -> 235.31s]  What's going on here?
[235.31s -> 237.31s]  Why am I losing this?
[237.31s -> 241.15s]  I didn't even jump and I made it over that.
[241.15s -> 245.56s]  Get out of my face!
[245.56s -> 250.16s]  Alright, going back to Commander Video.
[250.16s -> 252.16s]  Because he's my baby.
[252.16s -> 254.91s]  Oh, this might not even work.
[254.91s -> 257.52s]  I run into Fan over and over again.
[257.52s -> 259.52s]  I can't do this.
[259.52s -> 262.01s]  Oh, god.
[262.01s -> 265.47s]  Never mind.
[265.47s -> 273.07s]  Let's go.
[273.07s -> 275.07s]  Be careful here.
[275.07s -> 279.61s]  Oh, yeah.
[279.61s -> 282.24s]  Oh, man.
[282.24s -> 284.24s]  See, I gotta start paying attention.
[284.24s -> 289.04s]  I'm being like a real stupid bastard.
[289.04s -> 291.04s]  Land that, land this, and jump up.
[291.04s -> 293.60s]  There we go.
[293.60s -> 295.60s]  Just stay with me, boy. I'm having no luck here.
[295.60s -> 301.79s]  Ah!
[301.79s -> 304.35s]  Boop, boop.
[306.35s -> 308.91s]  I want to go back up that way.
[308.91s -> 310.91s]  No, I don't.
[310.91s -> 312.91s]  If I had Commander Video right here, I could float across this stupid thing.
[312.91s -> 315.47s]  Come on, you slug.
[315.47s -> 317.47s]  You know, I always say slug, but these really are slugs.
[317.47s -> 320.54s]  Didn't even realize that.
[320.54s -> 322.54s]  Oh, look, it's a slug, slug, slug.
[322.54s -> 324.54s]  Go, yes.
[324.54s -> 327.93s]  Just go.
[327.93s -> 329.93s]  You know, we're gonna do that again, but this time I'm just gonna go right off the bat.
[329.93s -> 333.07s]  Speed it up a little bit here, come on.
[333.07s -> 335.87s]  Speed it up.
[335.87s -> 337.87s]  That's what I like to see.
[337.87s -> 340.56s]  I can't go that fast, no.
[340.56s -> 343.05s]  No, I can.
[343.05s -> 345.68s]  God.
[345.68s -> 349.32s]  Oh, dear God.
[349.32s -> 355.00s]  Come on, no.
[355.00s -> 357.00s]  You gotta succeed on the first couple tries.
[357.00s -> 359.00s]  That's when you gotta really start to think about what you're doing.
[359.00s -> 361.63s]  Which is what I'm doing right now.
[361.63s -> 363.80s]  I forgot about this part.
[363.80s -> 366.36s]  You gotta jump up here.
[366.36s -> 368.99s]  Through there.
[368.99s -> 371.16s]  Over the slugs.
[371.16s -> 373.16s]  And that's the one. There she is.
[373.16s -> 376.75s]  She's the one for me.
[376.75s -> 382.44s]  Get out of the way, you giant slug.
[382.44s -> 386.03s]  Yeah.
[386.03s -> 389.72s]  Johnny's cage.
[389.72s -> 392.28s]  Give me the bandaid. How am I supposed to...
[392.28s -> 396.06s]  Oh, wow. Okay.
[396.06s -> 398.06s]  You know, this has got your name written all over it.
[398.06s -> 400.56s]  If I didn't...
[400.56s -> 403.63s]  Just hang out right here.
[403.63s -> 407.00s]  Oh, crap.
[407.00s -> 409.88s]  There we go. Got the bandaid.
[409.88s -> 413.40s]  Commander video, to the rescue.
[413.40s -> 415.40s]  Take the key, drop down, nice and easy.
[415.40s -> 418.09s]  And that's how you get a Thanksgiving turkey.
[418.09s -> 422.57s]  Oh, I'm too slow for this with commander video.
[422.57s -> 425.77s]  You can still try.
[425.77s -> 427.77s]  I can do it. I can do it.
[427.77s -> 430.01s]  Who am I kidding? I can do this.
[430.01s -> 433.92s]  Like that, and then you jump.
[433.92s -> 438.72s]  Float!
[438.72s -> 440.72s]  People want to see the deaths.
[440.72s -> 442.72s]  If I die a ton of times in a level, I will show the deaths.
[442.72s -> 449.48s]  Oh!
[449.48s -> 451.48s]  Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go. Faster.
[451.48s -> 456.40s]  Go!
[456.40s -> 458.64s]  Oh, I didn't get the key.
[458.64s -> 460.64s]  I tried to get that key, that was fine.
[460.64s -> 465.85s]  I didn't get it. Dammit.
[465.85s -> 469.61s]  Get out of the way.
[469.61s -> 471.61s]  A+.
[471.61s -> 474.54s]  Oh, what just happened?
[474.54s -> 476.54s]  Okay.
[476.54s -> 480.06s]  I'll accept it, I guess.
[480.06s -> 483.45s]  Up with this one.
[483.45s -> 485.45s]  And then float, and then yeah.
[485.45s -> 489.10s]  Get the key.
[489.10s -> 491.10s]  Get the second key. Oh, you know what?
[491.10s -> 494.04s]  Screw the second. I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[494.04s -> 498.33s]  I'm gonna have to try and make my way over this.
[498.33s -> 500.33s]  Commander video.
[500.33s -> 504.49s]  Supposed to be my go-to guy. Let's try this again.
[504.49s -> 506.99s]  Up, slow, and then up.
[506.99s -> 510.70s]  Okay.
[510.70s -> 513.20s]  Don't screw this up. Straight in the air.
[513.20s -> 516.89s]  Get this guy out of the way. There it is.
[516.89s -> 518.89s]  And my queen.
[518.89s -> 520.89s]  I've come to you. Let's see some of those deaths.
[520.89s -> 522.89s]  I died like seven great times.
[522.89s -> 524.89s]  Or four.
[524.89s -> 526.89s]  Yeah, one, two, three, four.
[526.89s -> 528.89s]  There goes one, there goes the other, and it's down to these two.
[528.89s -> 530.89s]  Who's gonna win? Who's gonna pull ahead?
[530.89s -> 532.89s]  It's gonna be Sally, it's gonna be Jeffrey.
[532.89s -> 536.41s]  No, it's not gonna be either of them, because I'm skipping it.
[536.41s -> 541.79s]  And let's go.
[545.69s -> 547.69s]  Warp Zone. Warp Zone, give me.
[547.69s -> 553.00s]  Give me the Warp Zone. I forget which one this is.
[553.00s -> 555.44s]  Super Meat Boy.
[555.44s -> 558.24s]  This one.
[558.24s -> 560.54s]  Probably not gonna do this, I'm not gonna lie.
[560.54s -> 563.61s]  Actually, maybe I will.
[563.61s -> 568.78s]  Maybe not. Went too fast.
[568.78s -> 570.78s]  Up. Now take your time with this.
[570.78s -> 574.75s]  Don't have to freak out here.
[574.75s -> 578.40s]  Unlock her cage.
[578.40s -> 580.40s]  Go visit her family for Thanksgiving dinner.
[580.40s -> 584.11s]  Like you promised. Like that.
[592.11s -> 595.82s]  Oh, oh, oh fuck!
[595.82s -> 598.70s]  You know, I had that. You all know I had that.
[598.70s -> 602.22s]  I'm gonna do it again.
[602.22s -> 604.40s]  You know, okay, I can't screw this up.
[604.40s -> 606.40s]  I cannot mess this up.
[606.40s -> 608.89s]  If you're gonna go fast, you gotta slow down up here.
[608.89s -> 611.64s]  Like that.
[611.64s -> 614.08s]  I almost just jumped over the damn thing.
[614.08s -> 618.04s]  And I would've freaked out.
[618.04s -> 622.91s]  Simple enough. Simple enough.
[622.91s -> 627.39s]  Simple enough. Oh my god!
[627.39s -> 630.19s]  Sorry, Meat Boy.
[630.19s -> 632.19s]  But the green stick figure told you
[632.19s -> 634.19s]  that she's in another castle, which means she's there.
[634.19s -> 640.76s]  Floaty. Floaty McFloat.
[640.76s -> 647.02s]  Get out of... Thank you.
[647.02s -> 649.02s]  Thank you very much.
[649.02s -> 653.23s]  Whoa. Commander video.
[653.23s -> 655.23s]  Ugh. I'm trying to like sing to this beat.
[655.23s -> 657.23s]  Hold on, I'll do it.
[661.79s -> 663.79s]  Oh, come on. I gotta think some lyrics.
[666.54s -> 668.54s]  Commander video
[668.54s -> 670.54s]  is the best character in the game.
[670.54s -> 672.54s]  He's gonna beat the whole thing.
[672.54s -> 674.54s]  Then he's gonna have some cake.
[674.54s -> 676.54s]  Commander video
[676.54s -> 678.54s]  just land on her head. Please don't squash her.
[678.54s -> 680.54s]  She's the one you're looking for
[680.54s -> 683.23s]  in another castle.
[683.23s -> 687.52s]  Oh, I didn't even mean to jump over that.
[687.52s -> 689.52s]  I love the noise he makes when he lands on things.
[689.52s -> 692.40s]  Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk. Bunk.
[692.40s -> 696.28s]  Hey, yo. Blee.
[696.28s -> 698.28s]  Coolest part about him is I will definitely make this
[698.28s -> 700.97s]  because I can just do this. Ha ha ha.
[700.97s -> 704.49s]  Almost didn't make that. Getting close here.
[704.49s -> 706.73s]  Getting close. Oh boy.
[706.73s -> 710.32s]  Might need Meat Boy for this.
[710.32s -> 714.40s]  No! Go.
[714.40s -> 716.40s]  No, just hide in the stupid thing.
[716.40s -> 719.85s]  Oh my god. I am so dumb.
[719.85s -> 724.27s]  Oh my god.
[724.27s -> 726.27s]  What is the matter with me?
[726.27s -> 728.64s]  Oh my god.
[730.64s -> 734.03s]  I'm losing my mind.
[734.03s -> 736.46s]  I'm starting to lose my mind.
[736.46s -> 739.34s]  No.
[739.34s -> 741.34s]  Oh my god. It's begun.
[741.34s -> 744.09s]  The freak out period is about to begin.
[744.09s -> 746.33s]  Okay.
[746.33s -> 748.33s]  I have to slow down here. Meat Boy.
[748.33s -> 754.01s]  Let's go.
[754.01s -> 759.71s]  No. I'm not going yet.
[759.71s -> 763.16s]  That's what I should have done in the very beginning.
[763.16s -> 767.52s]  There we go. Finally.
[767.52s -> 772.12s]  Don't die here. You'll never make it back.
[772.12s -> 777.24s]  I'm going to stick with Meat Boy for this one.
[777.24s -> 779.24s]  Oh, that is so loud in my head right now.
[779.24s -> 783.15s]  It hurts.
[783.15s -> 787.76s]  I'll be waiting.
[787.76s -> 796.00s]  Six feet.
[796.00s -> 799.90s]  Whoa.
[799.90s -> 803.68s]  Get out of my way. I'll take that key.
[803.68s -> 805.92s]  Open the door of
[805.92s -> 808.09s]  victory.
[808.09s -> 813.00s]  No. I'm not.
[813.00s -> 815.00s]  Just wait. Just wait.
[815.00s -> 820.89s]  Slow this down and I got this in the bag.
[820.89s -> 824.99s]  No.
[824.99s -> 828.44s]  Just wait.
[828.44s -> 830.88s]  I don't have to be too speedy.
[830.88s -> 832.88s]  It's all about just getting there.
[832.88s -> 835.50s]  And we got it.
[835.50s -> 840.28s]  Day breakup.
[840.28s -> 844.56s]  Jump.
[844.56s -> 848.59s]  That was close.
[848.59s -> 852.22s]  Was I going to just get out
[852.22s -> 860.60s]  of the way?
[860.60s -> 862.60s]  And this is a...
[862.60s -> 865.16s]  You know, I'm going to go down here.
[865.16s -> 867.16s]  Drop down. Jump up.
[869.92s -> 871.92s]  God. I'm so mad at that.
[871.92s -> 873.92s]  I can't believe I messed that up.
[873.92s -> 877.56s]  It was just...
[877.56s -> 881.34s]  Oh, my God.
[881.34s -> 883.34s]  This is the last level before the boss.
[883.34s -> 885.58s]  I know that. At least I think it is.
[885.58s -> 887.58s]  Maybe I'm wrong. I've been wrong before.
[887.58s -> 891.93s]  Get out of the way.
[891.93s -> 896.54s]  Jump up.
[896.54s -> 898.54s]  Around and down.
[898.54s -> 903.07s]  Now we got it.
[903.07s -> 905.76s]  No, not so fast.
[905.76s -> 908.81s]  No, no, no.
[908.81s -> 911.76s]  It's all right. We're good.
[911.76s -> 914.32s]  Oh, my God.
[914.32s -> 918.35s]  I got to stop doing that.
[918.35s -> 920.35s]  Okay, just jump.
[920.35s -> 922.35s]  Well, you just do it the way you're supposed to.
[922.35s -> 925.36s]  No, like, stupid tricks.
[925.36s -> 928.17s]  Let's see. Look at all these fools.
[928.17s -> 931.82s]  Oh, it's down to the two.
[931.82s -> 933.82s]  It's down to these two. Who's going to make it?
[933.82s -> 936.00s]  I go? I fall down?
[936.00s -> 938.56s]  Oh, don't worry. I'll come back.
[938.56s -> 940.56s]  Look, I'm right here with you again.
[940.56s -> 942.86s]  Oh, I'm so glad. Yes, we're friends forever.
[942.86s -> 944.86s]  We're both going to share the girl. We both love her forever.
[944.86s -> 947.23s]  Oh, that's so nice of you.
[947.23s -> 949.23s]  Oh, thank you.
[949.23s -> 951.23s]  Oh, and there he's gone. Oh, he's not.
[951.23s -> 953.23s]  When did I die with that guy?
[953.23s -> 956.43s]  Oh, right there.
[956.43s -> 959.80s]  And he makes it.
[959.80s -> 962.24s]  Time to close up chapter two.
[962.24s -> 964.24s]  Going against Chad.
[964.24s -> 966.24s]  Chad, if those of you do not know,
[966.24s -> 968.24s]  Chad is actually
[968.24s -> 970.24s]  in, well, he's actually the name of another
[970.24s -> 972.24s]  boss in Binding of Isaac.
[972.24s -> 974.60s]  Not, I guess, yeah, he is.
[974.60s -> 977.74s]  Press that button, I dare you.
[977.74s -> 979.74s]  I think it's a different look, though.
[979.74s -> 981.74s]  I totally forget if it's the same Chad.
[981.74s -> 986.97s]  I think it is.
[986.97s -> 988.97s]  Here he comes.
[994.08s -> 996.76s]  Yeah, he's in Binding of Isaac.
[996.76s -> 998.76s]  And the whole point of this is you're supposed to
[998.76s -> 1001.13s]  outrun him and die
[1001.13s -> 1004.01s]  from the very beginning.
[1004.01s -> 1006.01s]  I can't even, like, talk. I'm just so, this music
[1006.01s -> 1008.01s]  in my ear is just making me so scared.
[1008.01s -> 1011.79s]  Alright, let's just wait for him.
[1011.79s -> 1013.79s]  Wait for him, wait for him. Okay, now I'll go.
[1013.79s -> 1015.79s]  Can I get out of, like, the first part of the boss, please?
[1015.79s -> 1018.86s]  Don't want him to hit me.
[1018.86s -> 1020.86s]  So just stay above everything.
[1020.86s -> 1024.06s]  That's electric, that's electricity.
[1024.06s -> 1026.06s]  Where's the, oh, the key's down there?
[1026.06s -> 1028.06s]  I forgot about this. Oh, it's over.
[1028.06s -> 1030.30s]  I can't even get over there.
[1030.30s -> 1033.24s]  Just kill me.
[1033.24s -> 1035.24s]  Alright, so it's on the right, it's on the right.
[1035.24s -> 1039.08s]  Both at times, it's on the right. I got you.
[1039.08s -> 1041.84s]  Let's move. Can't even go over there.
[1041.84s -> 1045.61s]  I just tried to jump over there, my god!
[1045.61s -> 1047.61s]  Alright, Chad, got about enough of this.
[1047.61s -> 1052.67s]  Oh my god!
[1052.67s -> 1056.19s]  Why am I so bad?
[1056.19s -> 1060.99s]  Okay, let's do it.
[1060.99s -> 1065.21s]  I, what?
[1065.21s -> 1068.35s]  What? How am I, how
[1068.35s -> 1070.35s]  How do I get up there?
[1070.35s -> 1072.35s]  I forget, like, what you do in this, in this part.
[1072.35s -> 1077.34s]  Um, hold on.
[1077.34s -> 1079.34s]  No, there's a way to drop down right here. I'm an idiot.
[1079.34s -> 1082.60s]  How do you do it?
[1082.60s -> 1086.38s]  Don't worry, I got it.
[1086.38s -> 1090.54s]  Don't worry, guys, I got this.
[1090.54s -> 1094.12s]  I got this taken care of, don't worry.
[1094.12s -> 1096.12s]  Super Meat Boy's in the house.
[1096.12s -> 1098.12s]  He's got this taken care of out of control here.
[1098.12s -> 1100.12s]  Oh my
[1100.12s -> 1102.12s]  god!
[1102.12s -> 1104.12s]  I'm starting to really get annoyed.
[1104.12s -> 1109.05s]  Let's see, I wonder how many die at times I'm gonna die.
[1109.05s -> 1111.05s]  I'm gonna guess, like, 30.
[1111.05s -> 1113.05s]  Because after this, there's some more stuff to do.
[1113.05s -> 1115.36s]  It's all about just dodging.
[1115.36s -> 1117.36s]  No!
[1117.36s -> 1120.88s]  I'm gonna land on him!
[1120.88s -> 1122.88s]  No!
[1122.88s -> 1126.08s]  Yeah, go ahead, do your dumb thing.
[1126.08s -> 1129.98s]  Oh my god!
[1129.98s -> 1131.98s]  He keeps, I hate when he
[1131.98s -> 1134.28s]  Just do your
[1134.28s -> 1136.28s]  stupid thing, you big, fat,
[1136.28s -> 1138.28s]  ugly bastard. Get out of my way.
[1138.28s -> 1141.68s]  I'm gonna punch you in the, I can't even go up now.
[1141.68s -> 1143.68s]  Oh, you
[1143.68s -> 1145.68s]  You ripe, red tomato.
[1145.68s -> 1150.16s]  Okay.
[1150.16s -> 1152.16s]  This time, I'm not gonna just
[1152.16s -> 1154.16s]  jump down there, because he's gonna be there.
[1154.16s -> 1156.16s]  See? Told you. And I didn't even get the key.
[1156.16s -> 1158.16s]  Good thing I didn't, because there he is.
[1158.16s -> 1160.16s]  Oh!
[1160.16s -> 1163.87s]  I wish I could use command video,
[1163.87s -> 1169.12s]  but I can't!
[1169.12s -> 1171.12s]  Okay, if I don't do this this time,
[1171.12s -> 1173.12s]  I'm gonna put a hole through my
[1173.12s -> 1177.47s]  computer monitor. Take it easy.
[1177.47s -> 1180.35s]  Oh my
[1180.35s -> 1182.35s]  god! Oh my
[1182.35s -> 1184.35s]  god, I can't believe I did that.
[1184.35s -> 1186.35s]  I cannot believe, I'm
[1186.35s -> 1188.35s]  not even like halfway through this.
[1188.35s -> 1191.29s]  Son of a
[1191.29s -> 1193.29s]  See, once you start getting mad, that's when
[1193.29s -> 1195.29s]  things start to go downhill.
[1195.29s -> 1197.29s]  Collected, gotta get collected here.
[1197.29s -> 1200.62s]  You know, the screen is shaking too, that's why
[1200.62s -> 1203.50s]  it causes more problems.
[1203.50s -> 1205.50s]  Get me! Get me! Get the
[1205.50s -> 1209.53s]  Ugh!
[1209.53s -> 1213.18s]  Oh my
[1213.18s -> 1216.06s]  god. I wonder how many
[1216.06s -> 1218.06s]  times I've said oh my god, or oh my word.
[1218.06s -> 1226.36s]  Here we go again.
[1226.36s -> 1228.36s]  Alright, I'm in an okay spot
[1228.36s -> 1234.12s]  right here. Alright, we're done. We're done.
[1234.12s -> 1236.12s]  I just gotta get this key. If I, just get the
[1236.12s -> 1238.12s]  damn key, and just get it!
[1238.12s -> 1240.73s]  Just get the key! No!
[1240.73s -> 1243.74s]  Get out of my face! Get the key.
[1243.74s -> 1246.62s]  Get the other key. Don't even
[1246.62s -> 1248.62s]  worry about it. Just, just, it's okay.
[1248.62s -> 1250.62s]  It's okay. Get the
[1250.62s -> 1252.62s]  Oh my god, I did it! Oh!
[1252.62s -> 1256.12s]  Oh my god.
[1256.12s -> 1258.43s]  Whew!
[1258.43s -> 1261.18s]  That was the ragiest I've
[1261.18s -> 1263.18s]  been so far, and it's only gonna get worse.
[1263.18s -> 1265.61s]  So thank you guys so much for watching.
[1265.61s -> 1267.61s]  Chapter two. Chapter three
[1267.61s -> 1269.61s]  will be next coming Monday.
[1269.61s -> 1271.85s]  Every Monday is Super Meat Boy Monday!
[1271.85s -> 1274.35s]  Meat Boy Mondays! He still has my
[1274.35s -> 1277.48s]  girlfriend though. What's that?
[1277.48s -> 1280.28s]  Oh, it's little Chad! Hi!
[1280.28s -> 1282.89s]  Uh, hold on, let me look over
[1282.89s -> 1284.89s]  here for a second. We're going to go off!
[1284.89s -> 1286.89s]  No, I gotta, what are you doing, man?
[1286.89s -> 1289.20s]  I just, I wanna give you a kiss.
[1289.20s -> 1291.56s]  Uh, okay. Can you just like
[1291.56s -> 1293.56s]  back up for a second? Get out of here.
[1293.56s -> 1295.56s]  Oh, you killed me!
[1295.56s -> 1297.56s]  Dude, I'm wicked sorry.
[1297.56s -> 1299.56s]  Are you alright? No, I'm not alright.
[1299.56s -> 1303.07s]  Oh my god.
[1303.07s -> 1305.95s]  Whatever. Where is he?
[1305.95s -> 1308.38s]  Still over there? Oh, you threw my girlfriend!
[1308.38s -> 1310.62s]  Off with me! I'll get
[1310.62s -> 1314.38s]  that bastard! Let's go!
[1314.38s -> 1317.39s]  Chad? I still want that kiss,
[1317.39s -> 1319.39s]  please!
[1319.39s -> 1321.56s]  Okay, time to get out of here. This is
[1321.56s -> 1323.56s]  getting a little weird. I'm gonna have to just
[1323.56s -> 1325.56s]  put him out of his misery, and I just
[1325.56s -> 1327.56s]  why did I do that?
[1327.56s -> 1329.93s]  I just, like, voice acted that whole thing
[1329.93s -> 1331.93s]  as if it was actually, whatever.
[1331.93s -> 1334.68s]  So yeah, take care everybody. Thanks for
[1334.68s -> 1336.68s]  watching, I'll see you all on Chapter 3.
[1336.68s -> 1338.68s]  See you later, guys.
