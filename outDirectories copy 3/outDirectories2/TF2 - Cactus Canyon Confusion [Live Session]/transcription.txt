[0.18s -> 14.93s]  Everybody run. Run, run as fast as you can. Something about the gingerbread man. There's some line there.
[14.93s -> 22.32s]  Hey, but hi, welcome everybody. This is Cactus Canyon. This is the, uh, I guess improved Cactus Canyon.
[22.32s -> 29.56s]  If you remember the last time we played on this map, the, that is a spy, and he exploded, so we're okay.
[29.56s -> 38.23s]  But if you remember on Cactus Canyon last time, my last video, there was no way to conceivably, like, get through this choke point
[39.23s -> 44.23s]  unless, of course, you went straight through the choke point. So now they added a little thing to the top left here.
[44.23s -> 47.66s]  If I could, I don't want to pull, no, pull the shotgun out, you dipshit.
[47.66s -> 58.24s]  No! No! They added a little thing here. I can't even speak. Speak words, Jerma, speak words. Use your words.
[58.24s -> 64.17s]  Uh, they added a thing in the top left. There we go. That wasn't so hard, was it?
[64.17s -> 70.92s]  So now it's not just ridiculous people going through the choke. And there's a spy there. Who's on this cart? Oh, nobody, of course.
[71.92s -> 81.04s]  Nobody. Nobody. But I need to run. I need to get back in the water. Maybe get this medic to heal me. That would be fantastic.
[81.04s -> 87.47s]  You might be, yes, you are, in fact, a spy. No, you're not. I need my glasses checked.
[87.47s -> 93.34s]  You know, go see my local ophthalmologist. Go get a new prescription.
[93.34s -> 98.22s]  Sometimes your eyes aren't that good. My eyes are pretty bad, but that's a different story.
[99.71s -> 108.92s]  Hello, scout. Oh, medic, medic, medic, please. There we go. Surprise. That was a double.
[109.92s -> 120.34s]  Whoo. Whoo. More medic help. I love you. Be careful. Don't let them push.
[120.34s -> 125.77s]  We only, we only got eight and a half more minutes. Might sound like a lot, but watch out behind you.
[125.77s -> 131.46s]  Don't let them. Please, please let me get that shot. I almost messed that all up.
[131.46s -> 143.19s]  And yes, this is, hey, hey, just everybody chill. I got a pretty good streak going here.
[143.19s -> 148.75s]  I don't want to mess it up with any stupid moves, but we're going to get this demo man that went around this way.
[148.75s -> 153.76s]  And he doesn't even know we're chasing him. Oh, there's plenty of people over here.
[153.76s -> 163.51s]  Please, please. I just got that medic killed. That's a dead ringer for sure.
[163.51s -> 170.39s]  People are just everywhere. I'm in trouble. This is the end. This is the end for me. That's the end for me.
[170.39s -> 180.82s]  I died. Set up three seconds. What the fuck is going on here? Three sec. What?
[180.82s -> 193.18s]  Okay. I, there's a train. There's a train here now. What? And they just get to sit on the point.
[193.18s -> 201.71s]  All right. I'm pretty confused. Was there always a train here? I don't, was there?
[201.71s -> 210.22s]  This is cool if there wasn't. I don't remember a train. Damn it. Damn it.
[210.22s -> 216.62s]  They're going to cap the second point already. They're already going to get this second point.
[216.62s -> 225.82s]  And I, for one, am just all over the place with my shots. It's not going good right this second.
[225.82s -> 233.51s]  But at least we have that going for us. That is crazy. There's a, there's a legit train that comes down here.
[233.51s -> 244.34s]  Cool. Cool. I like it. And where am I even going? Yeah. Okay. So they come from over here.
[244.34s -> 250.41s]  I'm, for some reason, I am just totally confused at everything. I'm like a toddler right now.
[250.41s -> 257.25s]  I'm just seeing shapes and colors and going like, oh, look at those. They're cool.
[257.25s -> 262.25s]  Whoa. Crit Scree. That's a Crit Scree that I wasn't prepared for. That's a Crit Scree that I wasn't prepared for.
[262.25s -> 269.11s]  But it's okay. We'll get some money. We'll get some money out of it. We'll get the money's worth somehow.
[269.11s -> 275.57s]  And where are they spawning? Over here? Okay. I knew you were going to reflect that.
[275.57s -> 282.18s]  That's why I prepared for it. I trained for it. Don't notice me. Do not. How did you know I was here?
[282.18s -> 290.01s]  Everybody just move out of the way. Damn. I wonder what else they're going to add to this.
[290.01s -> 296.41s]  There must be a couple of other things that they're going to add. I'm not sure. Who knows?
[296.41s -> 302.17s]  Who knows what Valve has up their sleeve? They probably got like an ace or two.
[302.17s -> 310.80s]  When was the last time Valve used an ace? You know, I mean, we've seen some, we've seen some queens, we've seen some kings.
[310.80s -> 317.86s]  But when's, when's the next TF2 ace? I wonder. Please tell me you don't have a whole lot of health. You didn't.
[317.86s -> 326.45s]  There's like spies just like running around back here. Don't let, don't let him trick you.
[326.45s -> 328.45s]  He absolutely is not dead.
[330.07s -> 334.36s]  Man, we're going to hold this for a long time.
[334.36s -> 344.97s]  He said, damn man. Can we just, can we? Please. I knew you were going in that room, huh?
[344.97s -> 356.82s]  Just quit jumping around. It's not like time for cardio right now. Get, I'm making quite a few like exercise references here for some reason.
[356.82s -> 360.86s]  He just launched that back. He did, didn't he?
[360.86s -> 364.93s]  All right. Nobody, nobody do anything crazy. I need to refill myself.
[364.93s -> 369.94s]  I need to fill myself up with some delicious red beams.
[369.94s -> 376.40s]  There we go. Let's go. And let me get an overheal too.
[376.40s -> 380.83s]  Let me get an overheal. Just did damage to myself. Fantastic.
[380.83s -> 391.49s]  Well, you're real miraculously. You know what? I don't know what's over there.
[391.49s -> 398.62s]  I feel like there's a sentry right there, but you know, I don't know. I've been wrong many, many times before.
[398.62s -> 401.76s]  They're all up here. Okay. I got you.
[407.44s -> 412.64s]  Sorry. I'm being like silent right now. I just don't want to get smashed by something.
[412.64s -> 415.20s]  Can we open this? No, that's the train.
[415.20s -> 421.32s]  Hey, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[421.32s -> 425.65s]  Oh, don't shoot that back. You know what? I'm going to be safe here.
[425.65s -> 430.34s]  Let's be safe here. Anybody else? Come on.
[430.34s -> 436.23s]  Somebody walk into that. Ah, somebody could have walked into that.
[436.23s -> 439.98s]  I'm sorry. I'm like never prepared for this guy's crit screes.
[439.98s -> 443.74s]  I'm always like in the middle of like a reload animation.
[443.74s -> 446.58s]  Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
[446.58s -> 449.71s]  Damn it. He didn't die from the fall damage.
[449.71s -> 456.71s]  And now I'm going to die from this pyro unless I can somehow keep myself healed with this.
[456.71s -> 459.71s]  And you are a lifesaver and you died for me.
[459.71s -> 463.59s]  And we both died, but at least I got the pyro.
[463.59s -> 471.74s]  We just cannot have that right in his face.
[473.74s -> 477.74s]  Stand back. Stand back. Stand back.
[477.74s -> 480.88s]  Come on. Come on. Come on.
[485.32s -> 490.82s]  Uh, well, I did, I did get a couple of them.
[490.82s -> 494.38s]  I did do some work there. It wasn't all for nothing.
[494.38s -> 502.95s]  Maybe somebody's going to hear. I, I, can I just say I love maps with crazy hazards like this.
[502.95s -> 507.19s]  Because somebody always gets smashed by it. It's just like the saws in Sawmill.
[507.19s -> 511.86s]  It's just like the train that is in that train map.
[511.86s -> 517.62s]  I forget the name of it. I want to say freight, but I don't want to be like totally wrong.
[517.62s -> 524.06s]  Did I just, no, I thought I got a double kill there, but no, it was just a domination.
[524.06s -> 526.86s]  Get the health. You're safe.
[526.86s -> 529.86s]  There is a big sentry up there and that just is not going to happen.
[529.86s -> 536.73s]  We just cannot have that. We cannot have that right now, but what is that guy doing?
[536.73s -> 542.94s]  Come on. This is pyro. It's pyro mania.
[542.94s -> 544.94s]  It's pyro mania all over again.
[544.94s -> 553.54s]  They're going to call it. That cut is like landed on a pane of glass.
[553.54s -> 557.99s]  Oh, they're going to get it. I think we're going to lose.
[557.99s -> 559.99s]  I think we are going to lose this.
[559.99s -> 563.81s]  As much as I don't want to say it, I think it's possible.
[563.81s -> 565.81s]  It's like four people. Three people just get hit by the train.
[565.81s -> 567.81s]  How many people were on blue?
[567.81s -> 571.56s]  Hopefully more people on blue get hit by the train. I'm not even going to deal with you.
[571.56s -> 575.56s]  Get on top of the, I don't even know where I am right now.
[575.56s -> 581.73s]  I can't let you do that. I got backstabbed.
[582.73s -> 583.73s]  Swear.
[583.73s -> 586.73s]  I'm just going to scream a swear word right now.
[586.73s -> 589.57s]  Poop.
[589.57s -> 591.90s]  Watch out.
[591.90s -> 594.58s]  There's that. Where is this? Where does it go now?
[594.58s -> 597.72s]  Why do I not know this?
[597.72s -> 600.15s]  What is it doing?
[600.15s -> 604.67s]  I really can't believe I don't know what this is, what's happening right now.
[604.67s -> 608.67s]  Have I only played on one part of this game, of this mode or something?
[608.67s -> 610.67s]  Am I just crazy?
[610.67s -> 613.49s]  I wish that critscreek was here right now.
[613.49s -> 615.49s]  I'll tell you that.
[615.49s -> 616.49s]  I'll tell you that.
[616.49s -> 620.14s]  It's no secret.
[620.14s -> 622.14s]  Oh, they're going to get it.
[622.14s -> 624.14s]  I didn't realize it was that close.
[624.14s -> 626.14s]  Didn't realize it was that close. Somebody, please.
[626.14s -> 628.31s]  We're going to lose. Game over.
[628.31s -> 630.31s]  He pushed him off.
[630.31s -> 631.31s]  What a hero.
[631.31s -> 633.31s]  Don't let this medic get it.
[633.31s -> 634.31s]  Come on.
[634.31s -> 636.49s]  Come on.
[636.49s -> 637.49s]  Heroes.
[637.49s -> 640.24s]  You guys are heroes.
[640.24s -> 641.54s]  I love it.
[641.54s -> 642.54s]  I got to whip somebody. Let's go.
[642.54s -> 647.37s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[647.37s -> 649.37s]  Oh, there's no possible way.
[649.37s -> 652.37s]  We're going to keep this going for another six, seven minutes.
[652.37s -> 655.50s]  What is going on?
[655.50s -> 657.50s]  Is it going backwards?
[657.50s -> 660.50s]  Oh, what? It was going backwards, right?
[660.50s -> 665.22s]  What does a sentry up there?
[665.22s -> 667.22s]  Okay, that is...
[667.22s -> 670.49s]  I'm...
[670.49s -> 672.49s]  I don't have any words.
[672.49s -> 674.73s]  Words can't be expressed. Where does it cap?
[674.73s -> 676.73s]  Where's the actual cap point here?
[680.57s -> 684.66s]  Because like, seriously, I am...
[684.66s -> 687.53s]  Is it goes around a circle?
[687.53s -> 689.53s]  Okay. No, it stops right there.
[689.53s -> 692.65s]  And it just falls off.
[692.65s -> 696.02s]  Okay.
[696.02s -> 699.02s]  This whole video, I think I'm going to like... No, no, no.
[699.02s -> 701.46s]  Oh, it gets hit by the train.
[701.46s -> 703.82s]  It has to get hit by the train?
[703.82s -> 706.45s]  That's awesome.
[706.45s -> 708.69s]  Okay, now my confusion is over.
[708.69s -> 710.69s]  But that's really, really cool.
[710.69s -> 713.31s]  And yeah, that might be the end of the video.
[713.31s -> 716.00s]  I think it is.
[716.00s -> 718.00s]  Thanks everybody so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.
[718.00s -> 720.00s]  This has been Jerma is Confused at Everything
[720.00s -> 722.00s]  in the updated Cactus Canyon map.
[722.00s -> 724.00s]  Take care everybody. Have a nice day.
[724.00s -> 726.00s]  Goodbye.
