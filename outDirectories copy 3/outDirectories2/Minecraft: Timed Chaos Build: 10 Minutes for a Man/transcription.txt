[0.06s -> 7.69s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here, and...
[7.69s -> 9.99s]  MLC stuff! Hey guys!
[9.99s -> 13.30s]  Woohoo! Today, we're going to do something a little bit different.
[13.30s -> 16.30s]  We're going to do a Minecraft timed build.
[16.30s -> 22.60s]  And I know we're not the best Minecraft players in the world, but that's why we think it might be actually pretty interesting.
[22.60s -> 24.84s]  So, how is this going to work?
[24.84s -> 27.84s]  We're going to give ourselves 10 minutes timed. It'll be on the screen.
[27.84s -> 31.84s]  And whatever we build in 10 minutes, we're going to try and build a person.
[31.84s -> 34.02s]  That's today's episode.
[34.02s -> 39.25s]  So, whatever we come up with... What are you doing? Hello?
[39.25s -> 43.25s]  Whatever we come up with is what we're going to end with, so let's see what happens, okay?
[43.25s -> 45.49s]  So, I have the timer ready right here.
[45.49s -> 51.80s]  And in a few seconds, we're going to start building a person.
[51.80s -> 57.80s]  So, in the comments section, before we get started, in the comments section, let us know how well we did and something else for us to build.
[57.80s -> 60.80s]  I want to try and make this a weekly thing. So, are you ready?
[60.80s -> 64.98s]  Yeah, I've never played Minecraft before.
[64.98s -> 66.98s]  Like, in browser Minecraft.
[66.98s -> 69.66s]  Let's see how bad I am.
[69.66s -> 72.66s]  Okay. And we're starting now. Go.
[72.66s -> 75.97s]  You build the leg. I'm building the right leg.
[75.97s -> 79.97s]  Okay. Let's make sure... I have the worst creative mind.
[79.97s -> 81.97s]  I'm the worst at drawing things.
[81.97s -> 83.97s]  Build... We only got 10 minutes here.
[83.97s -> 88.27s]  Build four squares. Four squares going up.
[88.27s -> 90.27s]  You absolutely can't tell me how to build my leg.
[90.27s -> 92.27s]  It's going to be, like, symmetrical.
[92.27s -> 94.58s]  Okay, hold on. Let me see this here.
[94.58s -> 98.82s]  Yeah, he needs a red shoe. Hold on. We need to put that on him.
[98.82s -> 103.06s]  Hey, details come later. We got to get, like, the structure down first.
[103.06s -> 106.51s]  Dude.
[106.51s -> 108.51s]  All right. How high is yours?
[108.51s -> 112.75s]  Dude, already, like, one minute is almost gone by.
[112.75s -> 115.75s]  We don't even have his, like, legs.
[115.75s -> 117.93s]  Okay, hold on. Match it up. Match it up. Okay.
[117.93s -> 120.93s]  So, that's your legs.
[120.93s -> 124.93s]  He's going to be like...
[124.93s -> 126.93s]  Go one higher. Now we connect the legs.
[126.93s -> 128.30s]  No. Connect them now.
[128.30s -> 129.30s]  Yeah.
[129.30s -> 131.30s]  Just...
[131.30s -> 134.30s]  Oh, my God. This is the worst person ever.
[134.30s -> 139.30s]  He's not doing the splits. Look how far away his legs are.
[139.30s -> 146.86s]  We don't have enough time to, like, do this now, so...
[146.86s -> 149.86s]  All right. Now we need, like, the pants end, and it has to come, like...
[149.86s -> 152.86s]  Look at how skinny this guy is.
[152.86s -> 154.86s]  Hold on. It needs to be... Oh, God.
[154.86s -> 156.86s]  No, this is, like, his belt buckle right here.
[156.86s -> 158.86s]  Hold on. Okay, you build the belt.
[158.86s -> 164.86s]  I'm going to try and build, like, to make it so he's not, like, a freaking stop sign.
[164.86s -> 167.74s]  This guy is, like, as wide as a stop sign.
[167.74s -> 170.74s]  All right. I'm building his belt buckle.
[170.74s -> 175.05s]  Looks like he's wearing a diaper. Hold on.
[175.05s -> 179.05s]  We got, like, Tommy Pickle here.
[179.05s -> 184.49s]  Oh, man. This is so stupid. Oh, God.
[184.49s -> 185.49s]  What is... Why are you building...
[185.49s -> 186.49s]  That's his belt.
[186.49s -> 187.49s]  Okay, cool. Cool. Cool.
[187.49s -> 189.49s]  All right. Two minutes have gone by.
[189.49s -> 191.11s]  Oh, dear.
[191.11s -> 193.61s]  We got... I keep on, like, falling.
[193.61s -> 194.61s]  All right. While you do that...
[194.61s -> 195.61s]  Well, okay. I'm going to build his other shoe.
[195.61s -> 197.85s]  What did you do? Red?
[197.85s -> 199.85s]  Or red blocks.
[199.85s -> 200.85s]  Most simple shoe ever.
[200.85s -> 205.75s]  Drop down. How many blocks did you do?
[205.75s -> 208.76s]  That's a... Oh, God.
[208.76s -> 211.94s]  All right. So he's got his shoes.
[211.94s -> 216.31s]  He's got... He look... What does he look like?
[216.31s -> 220.00s]  Oh, my God. He looks like a Dig Dug character.
[220.00s -> 222.00s]  All right. We need... Okay, we got his belt.
[222.00s -> 223.00s]  Now we need his shirt.
[223.00s -> 225.00s]  Orange blocks. Orange blocks.
[225.00s -> 227.24s]  Yep.
[227.24s -> 229.24s]  Orange blocks. Okay.
[229.24s -> 230.24s]  Why is he, like, so...
[230.24s -> 232.24s]  What's with that thing at, like, back here?
[232.24s -> 233.24s]  Did I not, like, make his belt long enough?
[233.24s -> 235.24s]  No. I... Because he was, like...
[235.24s -> 236.24s]  I told you he was, like, a thin bastard.
[236.24s -> 238.24s]  He had to be, like, a little bit bigger.
[238.24s -> 239.24s]  All right.
[239.24s -> 241.24s]  All right. We're good. We're good.
[241.24s -> 243.67s]  We got this. We got this.
[243.67s -> 244.67s]  Time. What's the time?
[244.67s -> 248.70s]  Three minutes. We're good.
[248.70s -> 252.42s]  I'm sorry.
[252.42s -> 256.30s]  Oh, God.
[256.30s -> 257.30s]  He, like, pooped in his pants.
[257.30s -> 259.30s]  Why is his pants so low?
[259.30s -> 261.47s]  I know. I know.
[261.47s -> 263.47s]  He really, like, pooed his pants.
[263.47s -> 266.78s]  His body needs to be way bigger than this.
[266.78s -> 268.78s]  Ugh.
[268.78s -> 269.78s]  Watch out. Get out of the way.
[269.78s -> 272.78s]  I'm sorry. Oh, I dropped my blocks on the ground.
[272.78s -> 274.78s]  Go on. Go on.
[274.78s -> 278.41s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[278.41s -> 280.41s]  Why did he poop his pants?
[280.41s -> 282.41s]  That's something we can fix later.
[282.41s -> 285.41s]  His body needs to be at least twice the size of his, like...
[285.41s -> 287.41s]  He's gonna be, like, a weird freak.
[287.41s -> 290.41s]  His legs and his, like, butt are bigger than his body.
[290.41s -> 292.41s]  Like, are you kidding me?
[292.41s -> 294.58s]  Well, he could, like, make a perfect character,
[294.58s -> 295.58s]  like, on Hey Arnold or something,
[295.58s -> 297.58s]  where they always, like, already have screwed up proportions.
[297.58s -> 298.58s]  All right. All right.
[298.58s -> 299.58s]  Dude, we gotta get it.
[299.58s -> 300.58s]  We gotta get away from the body.
[300.58s -> 301.58s]  Four minutes have gone by.
[301.58s -> 303.58s]  We have, like, a lot of detail work to do.
[303.58s -> 305.89s]  Should we start the arms?
[307.26s -> 309.26s]  Finish what you're doing. I'm gonna start the arms.
[309.26s -> 311.26s]  He's just wearing a sweatshirt, right?
[311.26s -> 313.50s]  The arms are gonna come out, like, two or three blocks,
[313.50s -> 315.50s]  and then they're gonna go forward.
[315.50s -> 317.50s]  Wait, didn't we decide his skin was gonna be orange
[317.50s -> 319.50s]  and he was gonna have green pants?
[319.50s -> 321.50s]  He's shirtless. He's shirtless.
[321.50s -> 323.67s]  He's shirtless.
[323.67s -> 325.67s]  It's like summertime. He's, like, in his bathing suit.
[325.67s -> 327.67s]  All right, so come out. Let's see.
[327.67s -> 330.36s]  One, two...
[330.36s -> 333.30s]  All right.
[333.30s -> 335.30s]  One, two, three, four.
[335.30s -> 337.30s]  Come out four blocks.
[337.30s -> 339.61s]  And then go forward.
[339.61s -> 344.41s]  Go forward two.
[344.41s -> 346.41s]  What if I give someone a hug?
[346.41s -> 348.41s]  Yeah, he's trying to give someone a hug.
[348.41s -> 351.03s]  What is that, like, vanilla wafer?
[351.03s -> 353.03s]  Hey.
[353.03s -> 355.27s]  Let's, uh...
[355.27s -> 357.77s]  It's so hard to, like, stay afloat.
[357.77s -> 359.77s]  Oh, so I did my arm proportion wrong.
[359.77s -> 362.58s]  All right, whatever. Just go.
[362.58s -> 366.46s]  Okay, I'm trying to look and see what we got here so far.
[366.46s -> 368.83s]  What did you do here?
[368.83s -> 370.83s]  That's his poop.
[370.83s -> 372.83s]  Wait, he's fa...
[372.83s -> 375.33s]  That's the front of his pants?
[375.33s -> 377.33s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[377.33s -> 379.33s]  Why are you fixing it?
[379.33s -> 381.33s]  Because this is his forward. That's his, like...
[381.33s -> 383.33s]  When you poop in your pants, I'm sure it covers the front of your pants, too.
[383.33s -> 387.36s]  Okay, I'm gonna start on his head.
[387.36s -> 390.24s]  No, he needs to be wearing, like, a necktie or something stupid
[390.24s -> 392.24s]  to make it, like, so we can see where his head is.
[392.24s -> 395.18s]  All right, he's wearing...
[395.18s -> 397.36s]  This is, like, necktie.
[397.36s -> 400.62s]  Oh, Spongebob Squarepants, like, tie?
[400.62s -> 402.62s]  That's just that big?
[402.62s -> 404.62s]  There, that's good.
[404.62s -> 406.62s]  No, no, no. It's gotta be, like...
[406.62s -> 408.62s]  That's where, like, it looks like a tie.
[408.62s -> 410.62s]  I just broke his belly.
[410.62s -> 412.62s]  All right, good.
[412.62s -> 414.62s]  Now he's wearing a scarf, apparently.
[414.62s -> 416.62s]  Building a snowman, hold on.
[416.62s -> 418.62s]  We gotta add, like, the three...
[418.62s -> 420.62s]  Almost six minutes, dude.
[420.62s -> 424.40s]  We gotta, like, clean this up.
[424.40s -> 428.30s]  Oh, wrong button.
[428.30s -> 430.30s]  That's as good as...
[430.30s -> 432.30s]  Look at his, like, cocked to the side neck.
[432.30s -> 434.30s]  We need his eyes.
[434.30s -> 436.80s]  Okay, okay.
[436.80s -> 438.80s]  Did you give him, like, obsidian...
[438.80s -> 440.80s]  Those are nipples.
[440.80s -> 443.36s]  It looks like armpit hair.
[443.36s -> 445.36s]  Armpit hair, like, on his chest.
[445.36s -> 447.36s]  Okay, we're gonna give him these for eyes.
[447.36s -> 449.36s]  I don't even know what this is, but this is his eyes.
[453.18s -> 455.18s]  This is, like... Hold on.
[455.18s -> 457.49s]  All right, all right.
[457.49s -> 459.49s]  No, we need more... What is that?
[459.49s -> 461.73s]  What's that?
[461.73s -> 463.73s]  Oh, all right, all right. I see where you're going here.
[463.73s -> 466.42s]  Or I was just thinking mouth.
[466.42s -> 468.42s]  He needs fingers.
[468.42s -> 470.42s]  He can't just have these, like, sticks coming out for hands.
[474.45s -> 477.78s]  There's one finger.
[477.78s -> 480.46s]  There's two fingers.
[480.46s -> 482.83s]  There's another one.
[482.83s -> 487.06s]  There's another one.
[487.06s -> 489.06s]  Oh, great, like, alien claw fingers you made him.
[489.06s -> 491.06s]  Is he, like, the machine you get the toys out of?
[491.06s -> 493.06s]  What is he doing over here?
[497.49s -> 499.49s]  It looks like he's in the middle of a dance move.
[499.49s -> 501.49s]  He's like,
[501.49s -> 503.49s]  Yeah, let's do this.
[505.49s -> 507.49s]  All right, keep it going.
[507.49s -> 509.49s]  He needs... What else does he need? He needs hair.
[509.49s -> 512.05s]  Over seven minutes now.
[512.05s -> 514.42s]  All right, cool.
[514.42s -> 516.42s]  What color is his hair? How about...
[516.42s -> 518.78s]  Do we have, like, brown or something?
[518.78s -> 520.78s]  Brown wool. There we go.
[520.78s -> 523.28s]  Oh, it's going like nighttime.
[523.28s -> 525.28s]  I know.
[525.28s -> 527.28s]  We don't have any light here.
[527.28s -> 530.10s]  Whoops.
[530.10s -> 532.10s]  I'm giving him, like, a chef's hat
[532.10s -> 534.10s]  of brown hair.
[536.40s -> 538.40s]  What else can we do to him?
[538.40s -> 540.40s]  He looks like a total dumbass.
[549.38s -> 551.38s]  It's like
[551.38s -> 553.38s]  Chef Boy ID, the Pringles guy,
[553.38s -> 555.38s]  and, like, Spongebob Squarepants
[555.38s -> 557.38s]  had a baby.
[557.38s -> 559.38s]  And, like, this is him.
[559.38s -> 561.38s]  I was thinking Mr. Krabs a little bit.
[561.38s -> 564.38s]  All right, we only got, like,
[564.38s -> 566.38s]  a minute and a half left.
[566.38s -> 568.38s]  Let's clean him up a little bit.
[568.38s -> 570.94s]  We gotta give him a name, too.
[570.94s -> 573.50s]  Fix his hand.
[573.50s -> 575.50s]  This hand is such an atrocity.
[575.50s -> 577.50s]  Both hands are.
[577.50s -> 579.50s]  My, like, Minecraft is starting to lag.
[581.81s -> 583.81s]  I don't even know how hands work.
[583.81s -> 585.81s]  I'm opening my hand
[585.81s -> 587.81s]  right now, looking at it,
[587.81s -> 589.81s]  to try and, like, see what it looks like.
[589.81s -> 591.81s]  Okay, so this has to come out, like...
[591.81s -> 594.37s]  No, crap. I'm just standing here.
[594.37s -> 596.37s]  What am I doing? I'm giving him, like, a cane.
[596.37s -> 598.37s]  I'm looking at my hand again.
[598.37s -> 601.50s]  We're almost at nine minutes now.
[601.50s -> 603.50s]  Oh, great, great, like, bedpan hand
[603.50s -> 605.50s]  I gave him. Like, yeah, that's, like, fantastic.
[607.50s -> 609.50s]  Nice, like, skillet hand I gave him.
[609.50s -> 612.58s]  Oh, my God.
[612.58s -> 614.58s]  All right, feet. I forgot. We, like, have to come back to these
[614.58s -> 616.58s]  to make these better.
[616.58s -> 618.58s]  No. Dude, do your, like,
[618.58s -> 620.58s]  pants turn into your feet?
[620.58s -> 622.58s]  No, the boot has to come out like this.
[624.82s -> 626.82s]  Like, here we go, here we go.
[626.82s -> 628.82s]  Nice, like, Yoshi we made.
[628.82s -> 631.57s]  Super Mario Brothers.
[631.57s -> 633.57s]  And crab cakes.
[633.57s -> 637.14s]  Make it a little bit higher up here.
[637.14s -> 639.14s]  All right, crunch time. We've got about 30 seconds.
[639.14s -> 641.82s]  30 seconds to make this the best Minecraft
[641.82s -> 644.19s]  build ever.
[644.19s -> 646.19s]  This shoe is way too long.
[646.19s -> 649.90s]  We got, like, goofy.
[649.90s -> 651.90s]  An extremely goofy movie here.
[651.90s -> 654.59s]  Actually, I kind of like this character.
[654.59s -> 657.28s]  All right, what else? Make the tie,
[657.28s -> 659.28s]  short the tie a little bit. This is casual
[659.28s -> 662.03s]  Fridays. Make this, like,
[662.03s -> 664.21s]  that. No, that looks
[664.21s -> 666.58s]  like a tongue. And we're
[666.58s -> 668.58s]  coming down to, like, the final few seconds.
[668.58s -> 671.58s]  Three, two,
[671.58s -> 673.58s]  one, it's over.
[673.58s -> 675.82s]  There it is. Ten minutes.
[675.82s -> 678.00s]  And here he is, the
[678.00s -> 680.00s]  freak show.
[680.00s -> 682.43s]  So we've got to give him a name now. What's his name?
[682.43s -> 685.17s]  I don't know. How about, like,
[685.17s -> 688.94s]  Greg? Oh, hold
[688.94s -> 690.94s]  my line. He just, like, left the game.
[690.94s -> 692.94s]  Hey, you crashed at the perfect
[692.94s -> 694.94s]  time. I didn't want you to name our creation.
[694.94s -> 697.25s]  But in the comments section for anybody watching
[697.25s -> 699.25s]  this video, go ahead and give this guy a name.
[699.25s -> 701.25s]  As well as a rating.
[701.25s -> 703.25s]  Like, as to how well we did.
[703.25s -> 706.38s]  Like, one out of ten. So, still a one to ten.
[706.38s -> 708.38s]  How well did we do with this guy?
[708.38s -> 711.07s]  And I think that's going to be it, guys. So,
[711.07s -> 713.07s]  again, leave in the comments what you think we should do
[713.07s -> 715.07s]  for the next build. And, yeah.
[715.07s -> 717.63s]  Take care, everybody. And, Stealth, you got
[717.63s -> 719.63s]  anything to say? Yeah, just
[719.63s -> 721.63s]  take care, everybody.
