[0.31s -> 18.66s]  This place has like a weird playground mode. Wow, are you serious? No, don't fall in the spikes.
[23.14s -> 26.58s]  Please help me. I didn't want to die. I don't want to die like this.
[28.66s -> 34.01s]  Dude, this is brutal. I'm gonna turn.
[38.50s -> 45.04s]  Unbelievable. I'm still alive. I'm turning into a piece of trash.
[55.56s -> 58.92s]  I can't believe this is actually still a drivable car.
[59.72s -> 63.88s]  Well, it's okay. I just, you know, whatever. I turned into a fucking piece of trash.
[67.27s -> 71.35s]  Come on, you can do it. You can do it, little trash car.
[72.31s -> 77.11s]  No, I can't. I couldn't do it. I couldn't. You told me I could. I couldn't do it, mummy.
[81.14s -> 85.22s]  This is the thing from Double Dare. You guys remember Double Dare?
[85.78s -> 88.74s]  The thing on Nickelodeon when the people would slime through this thing and it like looked like
[88.74s -> 94.66s]  it was going to squish them? Double Dare, this is awesome. I can't wait to see what happens here.
[94.66s -> 104.17s]  Did you get the flag? Did you pick up the flag, dad? Oh, god damn it. Goofball asshole,
[104.17s -> 109.85s]  dad didn't pick up the flag at the end. I'm not going to get my Super Nintendo and my mountain bike.
[110.49s -> 115.53s]  You guys remember the prizes for Double Dare? They were shit. You got like a Super Nintendo
[115.53s -> 130.97s]  game and a bike. That is so cool. That was awesome. I love physics engines, man. There's
[130.97s -> 135.94s]  so much fun. What else is there? What other like weird toys can I play with in this game?
[139.56s -> 144.52s]  Yeah, I think I'm going to need your insurance information. You backed into me when we were at
[144.52s -> 150.44s]  the Walgreens. I could really... my car has a bump on the fender now. You need to get your
[150.44s -> 159.40s]  insurance, you fucking bitch. This is definitely the best thing is this thing down here. Just you
[159.40s -> 167.26s]  get absolutely destroyed in here. I seriously want to... I wonder how much car damage you can really
[167.26s -> 172.65s]  do. The thing from the Brave Little Toaster is my goal. I want to turn into a cube from the Brave
[172.65s -> 183.06s]  Little Toaster. I'm making a lot of references to old shit in this video. Hi, I'm Mr. Car and I don't
[183.06s -> 194.57s]  feel good right now. My tummy hurts. Welcome to the dentist. In my office, how we do things is I use
[194.57s -> 207.05s]  a super teeth grinder. And your teeth really need to be cleaned. Yes, yes they do. Don't mind,
[207.05s -> 225.03s]  don't mind the guy crashing into the wall. I gotta go look at that guy. The guy looks like a school
[225.03s -> 236.20s]  bus. The guy... oh no, he's gonna get crushed. Oh no, no, he can't do it. Yeah, yeah, okay, I hear you.
[236.20s -> 242.54s]  Yeah, so where's this cargo going? This really expensive cargo from Japan? Yeah, well, I don't
[242.54s -> 246.62s]  want to just be careful next to it because, you know, you never know what could happen if you
[246.62s -> 253.02s]  accidentally bump it. And if you couldn't understand the joke already, then oh no, all that expensive
[253.10s -> 263.19s]  Japanese cargo. Whatever will we do? Whatever will we do? That joke's getting edited out of the video.
[267.35s -> 272.63s]  Get in the jet engine. You can do it, Luke Skywalker. Use the force, just like in the movie.
[273.77s -> 287.74s]  Yes! Come on, get in the six, you fuck. Yes! Yes! And the four. And the four. That's ten points.
[290.70s -> 295.34s]  Are you trying to tell me right now that this person in here is not injured at all?
[295.34s -> 302.38s]  Is this even a person? Is this like, what is this thing? This poor guy's stuck. Oh no, I'm stuck in
[302.38s -> 310.90s]  here. Whatever will I... See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.
[312.10s -> 313.78s]  The giant enemy spider.
[313.78s -> 350.07s]  I don't even know. Help. What have I done? My frames are going down. I just want to go bowling.
[350.71s -> 362.25s]  That's all I wanted to do. Just want to go bowling. I just want to go bowling. Cousin. Cousin. Let's go bowling.
