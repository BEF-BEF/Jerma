[0.31s -> 20.48s]  Quick! Get the health! Get it! Yay! Turn her behind you! Behind you! Behind you!
[20.48s -> 31.75s]  He just got turned on! Don't ever come in the museum and start firing a gun, Scout.
[31.75s -> 35.75s]  Don't you know the rules? Please help me defend the museum! Someone is trying to steal the painting!
[35.75s -> 41.25s]  Somebody... Thank you. Thank God I have this security guard on duty.
[41.25s -> 46.74s]  I have the security guard on duty protecting the museum spy statue.
[46.74s -> 52.21s]  Any more burglars gonna come try and steal me?
[52.21s -> 55.21s]  This really is great how this demo knight is just protecting me.
[55.21s -> 60.97s]  Is he gonna... No! No! Help me! No!
[60.97s -> 71.98s]  This guy. I wonder what he's doing down here.
[71.98s -> 75.24s]  Okay, bye.
[75.24s -> 79.54s]  Alright. Why did he get right in my face? He got right in my face.
[79.54s -> 84.70s]  And then just decided I wasn't an enemy.
[84.70s -> 90.08s]  What is he doing? Oh, it's a spy! Hey! Hey!
[90.08s -> 101.11s]  He went too late! He stole it!
[101.11s -> 108.74s]  How long can the spy statue survive if it's up in a very dangerous place?
[108.74s -> 110.92s]  That's my question.
[110.92s -> 114.22s]  Like, if it's up here, can it survive?
[114.22s -> 118.04s]  Can the spy statue survive if it's in a place like this?
[118.04s -> 120.60s]  That's the age-old question.
[120.60s -> 124.10s]  I'm kind of in the sniper's way.
[124.10s -> 127.94s]  The sniper...
[127.94s -> 130.94s]  The sniper doesn't know. He just figured it out.
[130.94s -> 136.10s]  He just was like, what the hell?
[137.10s -> 143.55s]  The way he looked over, he glanced over and was like, oh shit, what the hell is this?
[143.55s -> 152.21s]  Don't you ever touch the spy statue again!
[152.21s -> 156.71s]  So get yourselves ready, security guards.
[156.71s -> 159.71s]  This is an expensive statue from the Egyptian times.
[159.71s -> 161.71s]  Think about it like that.
[161.71s -> 165.71s]  This is the most expensive statue you've ever seen in your life.
[165.71s -> 167.71s]  You are tasked with protecting it.
[167.71s -> 170.34s]  Yeah, it's like a pharaoh.
[170.34s -> 174.34s]  This is like, we got this statue at a king-touch tomb, alright?
[174.34s -> 176.34s]  Are you ready, you attackers?
[176.34s -> 178.34s]  Come get the statue. Good luck.
[178.34s -> 183.84s]  This is so dumb.
[183.84s -> 190.84s]  Well, I've lasted more than eight seconds.
[190.84s -> 194.94s]  So that's a good thing.
[194.94s -> 198.11s]  Uh-oh. Have they breached the defenses?
[198.11s -> 200.11s]  Oh, he's breaching! He's breaching!
[200.11s -> 203.61s]  Oh, look out on the right here! On the right, on the right, on the right!
[203.61s -> 206.10s]  Jesus!
[206.10s -> 209.24s]  No!
[210.24s -> 215.59s]  Oh, I think we're going to lose this one.
[215.59s -> 220.07s]  Oh, shit.
[220.07s -> 223.02s]  It's just me and the two engineers.
[225.90s -> 227.90s]  I don't know.
[227.90s -> 230.58s]  I haven't figured that out yet.
[230.58s -> 233.14s]  Alright, guys.
[233.14s -> 236.14s]  And on the count of three, the attackers are allowed to come in.
[236.14s -> 237.14s]  You have 30 seconds in.
[237.14s -> 239.14s]  Three, two, one.
[239.14s -> 247.08s]  Try to get the statue. 30 seconds.
[247.08s -> 249.08s]  Looking good so far, boys.
[249.08s -> 252.92s]  We're 10 seconds in.
[252.92s -> 254.92s]  We got a bonk scout.
[254.92s -> 256.92s]  We got a bonk scout!
[256.92s -> 258.92s]  This bonk scout might do it!
[258.92s -> 260.92s]  Nope, nope, good. 10 seconds.
[260.92s -> 264.89s]  Oh, damn it!
[264.89s -> 269.88s]  They got it in 22 seconds.
[269.88s -> 272.82s]  This is the museum.
[272.82s -> 275.19s]  It's a very nice museum. It's like a rundown piece of shit.
[275.19s -> 279.26s]  You like this museum? It's like a bunch of boards.
[279.26s -> 281.82s]  That was a bad... I didn't want to do that.
[281.82s -> 286.54s]  Yeah, everybody on blue, get in the secret criminal hideout.
[286.54s -> 288.71s]  Get in there!
[288.71s -> 290.71s]  Meatball monster, get in there!
[290.71s -> 293.14s]  Get in there!
[293.14s -> 296.41s]  Well, he's gone.
[296.41s -> 299.16s]  So, look, here's the criminal.
[299.16s -> 301.16s]  This is so stupid looking.
[301.16s -> 303.46s]  You guys look like such a dipshits.
[303.46s -> 305.46s]  I love it.
[305.46s -> 309.80s]  Go for it.
[309.80s -> 311.80s]  Everybody protect the statue.
[311.80s -> 318.07s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[318.07s -> 323.70s]  Yeah, watch this other door.
[323.70s -> 325.70s]  The criminals are everywhere.
[325.70s -> 333.83s]  Oh, wow.
[333.83s -> 336.78s]  Oh, wow.
[336.78s -> 338.78s]  That's not good. That's not good.
[338.78s -> 342.55s]  That's so...
[342.55s -> 344.55s]  Oh, I died. I died like right at the end there.
[344.55s -> 348.46s]  Make sure you do not high five me though.
[348.46s -> 350.46s]  That's important.
[350.46s -> 354.42s]  Okay, there is...
[354.42s -> 356.42s]  Somebody has to stop that
[356.42s -> 358.42s]  before I say go.
[358.42s -> 362.90s]  Alright, ready security guards?
[362.90s -> 364.90s]  Attackers, attack!
[364.90s -> 366.90s]  Come get the statue.
