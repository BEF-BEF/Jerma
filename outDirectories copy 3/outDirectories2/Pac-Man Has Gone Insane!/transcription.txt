[0.31s -> 14.46s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with one of the weirdest games I've ever played in my entire life.
[14.46s -> 21.58s]  This is Pac-Man 2 The New Adventures, and if you don't know what this game is, then you are in for a treat.
[21.58s -> 28.22s]  You're in for quite a surprise, mainly because of the game's gameplay. It doesn't make any sense at all.
[28.22s -> 31.92s]  I'm not gonna spoil it. You'll see it in just a second. Gonna go into the live commentary here,
[31.92s -> 35.98s]  and I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
[35.98s -> 44.53s]  So, as you can probably imagine, this game is not Pac-Man. This has nothing to do with the old Pac-Mans.
[44.53s -> 48.99s]  This is, like, I have a baby, I have a wife, that's Ms. Pac-Man, I'm assuming.
[49.17s -> 54.09s]  We're out of milk and Pac-Baby's still hungry. Can you go get some more milk, please?
[55.93s -> 61.55s]  Sure, I guess why not? No problem. Welcome to Pac-Man 2 The New Adventures.
[61.71s -> 64.56s]  So, let me break down the controls real quickly here.
[64.56s -> 69.72s]  I move this cursor around, and I can either shoot a slingshot to, like, get his attention,
[69.72s -> 74.89s]  and make him stop moving. Like, for instance, that didn't work. He just got really happy.
[74.89s -> 78.84s]  Stop. No, no, no. Stop with me. Stop with me. Stop moving. I have to, like, do this.
[78.84s -> 84.29s]  Okay, you're safe now. So, you have to interact with the world around Pac-Man to...
[84.29s -> 88.50s]  What the fuck are you doing? You're supposed to go that way.
[88.50s -> 95.46s]  Pac-Man has the attention span of a goldfish in, like, the first grade.
[98.87s -> 100.37s]  Alright, so you're getting happy.
[100.37s -> 115.22s]  What was that face? No, go back. You're going the wrong way, stupid.
[115.22s -> 121.42s]  He just did this, like, I don't know, like, he did this crazy, like, old man, curled up litho.
[121.42s -> 129.26s]  I wouldn't even do that again. Go over and get the milk, you friggin' baby.
[129.26s -> 135.39s]  Oh, look, it's a chicken. Get the chicken. Shoot the chicken. Alright, get it.
[135.39s -> 145.01s]  I'm not exactly sure what the whole point of this game is, because it...
[145.11s -> 148.05s]  I'm sure it's becoming very evident right now, guys.
[148.05s -> 152.20s]  They thought Namco thought it was... Are you serious?
[152.20s -> 155.83s]  Did he just seriously walk into that? What an idiot.
[155.83s -> 160.24s]  Alright, just walk into something and let me have one of these.
[160.24s -> 166.30s]  No, go over here. Go to the hot dog man.
[166.30s -> 171.56s]  You pissy bitch, just go this way and look up. Talk to him.
[171.56s -> 176.38s]  Do you not see the hot dog man? Oh, oh, did you finally see him?
[176.38s -> 180.75s]  How do you not see this hot dog guy? Are you kidding me right now?
[180.75s -> 186.10s]  I just pissed him off.
[186.10s -> 189.68s]  What just made him so happy?
[189.68s -> 194.24s]  Why can I not just control him? Why didn't they make a platformer?
[194.24s -> 196.64s]  Why did they not make this game a platformer?
[196.64s -> 201.54s]  Why is it, like, a point and click, like, follow the moron around
[201.54s -> 208.39s]  and make him, like, look at stuff and get scared by, like, animals?
[208.39s -> 214.01s]  Nobody has any mail for Pac-Man?
[214.01s -> 217.91s]  I love that face so much. I love everything about that face.
[217.91s -> 226.20s]  Eat the apple. Eat it. You know, it's good. It's delicious.
[226.20s -> 232.32s]  All right, now sneak by this dog. Be careful. Look at the dog.
[232.32s -> 235.23s]  You just had an apple. You fucking idiot.
[235.23s -> 238.95s]  I just, I didn't tell you to do that.
[238.95s -> 242.77s]  Read the sign. He is so happy.
[242.77s -> 247.12s]  He doesn't even care that this could be, like, dangerous.
[247.12s -> 257.06s]  Grab that apple. Pick it up. What the fuck was that?
[257.06s -> 263.77s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[263.77s -> 268.38s]  Why did he just scream? What was the point?
[268.38s -> 272.87s]  What, what, who, who screams? Who screams for no reason?
[272.87s -> 277.84s]  Who, who, who screams?
[280.83s -> 293.65s]  Now he's depressed. Where are you going? Where is he going?
[293.65s -> 295.35s]  Oh, yeah, you should have looked out for that.
[295.35s -> 301.02s]  Yeah, you should have paid attention to your surroundings, you idiot.
[301.02s -> 303.22s]  Look, look, look, look, look. Don't trip. Don't trip.
[303.22s -> 306.39s]  You see it? Okay, step over it.
[306.39s -> 310.58s]  Yeah, it's a skateboard. Get on the skateboard.
[310.58s -> 313.99s]  Go have some fun for once in your life.
[313.99s -> 316.55s]  It's still telling me to get the milk.
[316.55s -> 320.64s]  All right, go get the milk. Go get the milk.
[320.64s -> 323.43s]  I need to do something. Go get the milk.
[323.43s -> 328.58s]  Go that, yes, yes, yes, yes, this way.
[328.58s -> 331.08s]  Sure, I know you're, I know you're upset.
[331.08s -> 341.74s]  I would be upset too if I tripped on a rock and screamed at a bird for, for seemingly absolutely no, my fucking God.
[341.74s -> 347.43s]  Pac-Man's very chaotic life is kind of like managing a sim.
[347.43s -> 353.33s]  When you have a sim that is unhappy, they don't go to work right, they don't perform well, they have bad...
[353.43s -> 356.85s]  Oh shit, hold on. Okay, I don't want to get in trouble by that.
[356.85s -> 361.29s]  But when you have a sim and they're not like at their peak happiness, you can't do anything with them.
[361.29s -> 364.09s]  They don't want to do anything. They're too tired. They're too hungry.
[364.09s -> 368.78s]  I at least have all my bars filled up on the happiness and energy meter.
[368.78s -> 377.46s]  So I should be able to do this now. Pick up the milk, please.
[377.46s -> 381.13s]  Stop whistling to yourself and pick the milk up.
[381.13s -> 390.25s]  Please, please pick up the, please just stand, stand, get underneath it.
[390.25s -> 393.83s]  There you go. Do you see it? Okay, you see it.
[393.83s -> 397.88s]  Here we go. Bang. It worked. I'm going to, I'm going to get the milk.
[397.88s -> 401.58s]  I know I pissed him off in the process, but it's okay. Just, just get your composure together.
[401.58s -> 408.94s]  Get yourself together Pac-Man and pick up the milk and go get the milk.
[408.94s -> 417.24s]  Watch out. Don't trip on the rock. Get off the skateboard.
[417.24s -> 421.64s]  Actually ride the skateboard. There we go.
[430.85s -> 441.60s]  I even told him to look too and he just didn't. I think he just has tunnel vision.
[441.60s -> 445.58s]  Are you going to actually listen to me this time? Look, look to the ground.
[445.58s -> 451.36s]  Stop. Why are you riding a skateboard with your eyes closed? What are you doing?
[451.36s -> 454.26s]  Who closes their eyes and rides a skateboard?
[454.26s -> 457.16s]  That's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking seen somebody do.
[457.16s -> 463.83s]  Hey, yeah, I'm going to get on a skateboard. Might as well close my eyes as tight as I can.
[463.83s -> 472.57s]  This is ridiculous. How am I supposed to make him not close his eyes?
[472.57s -> 475.07s]  Here he goes again, closing his eyes.
[475.07s -> 478.12s]  What if I shoot him? Will he like open his eyes?
[478.12s -> 490.07s]  Hey, there we go. All right. So to get him, yeah, yeah, thanks.
[490.07s -> 493.12s]  Does this honestly surprise you every time?
[493.12s -> 496.95s]  This can't surprise you every time it happens.
[496.95s -> 501.69s]  I wonder if he's going to stop and like look at the cow for the fourth, fifth fucking time in a row.
[501.69s -> 505.49s]  Hey, look, I love cows. Hey, let me stop and like look at the bird too.
[505.49s -> 511.01s]  He's like, I've never seen a bird before. Is there another bird in here?
[511.01s -> 516.12s]  Yes, birds. Oh, look, another bird. Isn't that wonderful?
[516.12s -> 521.28s]  Goal. Goal.
[521.28s -> 524.08s]  That's a nice walk you got there, Pac-Man. Nice high legged walk.
[524.08s -> 532.41s]  Oh, yes, you want a hot dog. Oh, yes, I love hot dogs.
[532.41s -> 536.94s]  You cat son of a bitch.
[536.94s -> 540.63s]  What are you doing? What does he do? What does he do?
[540.63s -> 551.31s]  Get the cat. No, no, no, no, no, don't get another one.
[551.31s -> 552.31s]  Don't get another one. He's going to spray you.
[552.31s -> 558.22s]  He's going to spray you with ketchup. Eat the pill and it'll make you feel better.
[558.22s -> 559.52s]  Oh, my God.
