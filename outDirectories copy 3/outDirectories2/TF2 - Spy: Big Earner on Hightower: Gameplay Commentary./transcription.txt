[3.38s -> 13.35s]  Hey, what is happening guys? It is Jerma here with a gameplay commentary. This
[13.35s -> 16.99s]  time I'm playing as the spy and the loadout for this match is going to be
[16.99s -> 22.05s]  the big earner the new spy knife from the uber update, the ambassador and the
[22.05s -> 27.33s]  default vanilla invisibility watch. I told you guys I promised you I'd get an
[27.33s -> 30.45s]  invisibility watch gameplay that I wasn't just gonna do all dead ringer and
[30.45s -> 35.16s]  here you go here it is I promised you so I'm gonna deliver on that. Also we are
[35.16s -> 39.06s]  playing on payload race Hightower which was introduced in the engineer update
[39.22s -> 42.14s]  and right off the bat here I get two quick stabs I thought for sure I was
[42.14s -> 45.18s]  gonna be able to get at least three or four people right there but that heavy
[45.18s -> 51.27s]  has some quick reflexes and puts me down six feet under. That is one of two deaths
[51.27s -> 54.87s]  that occur during this gameplay and I'll give you my quick assessment on the big
[54.87s -> 58.36s]  earner the knife that I'm using currently. I don't think it really works
[58.36s -> 61.96s]  that well with the default invisibility watch or obviously the cloak and dagger
[61.96s -> 66.04s]  the reason being because when you stab somebody the mechanic of this knife is
[66.04s -> 69.04s]  when you backstab somebody or when you kill somebody I believe it's when you
[69.08s -> 73.48s]  kill somebody as well you get 30% cloak and as you'll see right here I backstab
[73.48s -> 77.64s]  this heavy but I have full cloak anyways it doesn't really matter and there's so
[77.64s -> 81.28s]  many ammo cases when you're using the default invisibility watch that by the
[81.28s -> 85.36s]  time you backstab your next victim you're gonna have full cloak anyways and
[85.36s -> 89.24s]  it's not gonna do you any good you're just losing 25 health. Now with the dead
[89.24s -> 93.24s]  ringer though this knife is incredible because when you backstab somebody if
[93.24s -> 97.80s]  you use the dead ringer and you use the Latranja or however you pronounce it
[97.84s -> 101.04s]  you'll be doing huge benefits to yourself because you'll backstab
[101.04s -> 105.24s]  somebody and if you turn around and shoot one person you'll have full cloak
[105.24s -> 108.96s]  to just use it again you are pretty much invincible if you use the dead ringer
[108.96s -> 114.28s]  the Latranja and this knife. As you just saw I backstab that heavy with not a
[114.28s -> 118.12s]  whole lot of cloak and I got a lot back but that's pretty much the only time it
[118.12s -> 120.96s]  happens in this whole gameplay this is great here I get these two snipers with
[120.96s -> 124.84s]  two great headshots that really helps the team out because now the car can come
[124.84s -> 128.16s]  through here rather than having them pick off everybody that comes through
[128.16s -> 132.08s]  this little corridor. So now I'm just trying to patrol the area what you
[132.08s -> 135.68s]  should be doing as a spy on these types of maps anyways it's kind of your job
[135.68s -> 139.28s]  just to patrol the area make sure no one's lurking around somewhere that's
[139.28s -> 142.32s]  the best thing to do on this map especially Hightower so walking around
[142.32s -> 145.96s]  checking to see where people are where the team is where the other team is it's
[145.96s -> 149.36s]  kind of your duty as a spy to do these things and I get up behind these guys
[149.36s -> 152.64s]  trying to pretend like I'm a sniper switch my weapons a couple times I get
[152.64s -> 159.28s]  behind this heavy medic pair and it's doom doom and gloom for you two special
[159.28s -> 163.70s]  guest appearance by Satan right there so thank you Satan anyways I saw there was
[163.70s -> 166.26s]  a demo man there that I couldn't get behind I probably would have fallen off
[166.26s -> 169.94s]  the cliff if I tried to so I got out of there quickly and this is a great stab
[169.94s -> 172.58s]  right here this pyro is kind of running sideways and I get him with a little
[172.58s -> 177.83s]  side stab so thank you for coming mr. pyro carts are looking pretty even right
[177.83s -> 180.59s]  now so I try to come back up these stairs I'm gonna try and get a couple
[180.63s -> 184.67s]  more headshots on the snipers that are up here so I think they wised up though
[184.67s -> 190.35s]  because they're not there so if you're unaware the ambassador is the only other
[190.35s -> 193.67s]  weapon in the game that can crit with a headshot it's the only other weapon that
[193.67s -> 197.99s]  can headshot period but that was a pretty big fail right there so I probably
[197.99s -> 200.95s]  shouldn't have even went for the stab I probably should have just backed off and
[200.95s -> 205.67s]  went the other direction but that's the only other time I die in the gameplay so
[205.67s -> 210.21s]  let's see what I can accomplish in the next two or three minutes huh coming out
[210.21s -> 213.53s]  of the respawn now and I don't understand how this happens you guys
[213.53s -> 217.81s]  will see I do a direct shot right in this medic's face like it couldn't be
[217.81s -> 223.02s]  any more perfect and watch this doesn't register not even a hit not even a hit I
[223.02s -> 228.05s]  got him right in the face to lag compensation for the win huh so anyways
[228.05s -> 231.17s]  I'm trying to get behind these guys they know him around that medic they both die
[231.17s -> 235.29s]  from the scout so that was a pretty good part on the scout so now just patrolling
[235.29s -> 238.61s]  again looking for somebody to kill looking for somebody to maim come back
[238.61s -> 241.77s]  up here no snipers again I thought for sure they would come back because look
[241.77s -> 245.73s]  where the cart is that isn't a prime spot for snipers and oh German won't
[245.73s -> 248.33s]  forgot to hit the spacebar you got to do that when you jump don't forget that
[248.33s -> 252.84s]  next time so anyways this is kind of how high tower goes in your spy you're gonna
[252.84s -> 256.08s]  do a lot of walking around and when the carts are even like this in the spots
[256.08s -> 258.84s]  where they are you're gonna do a lot of moving around a lot of walking around
[258.84s -> 262.14s]  trying to find somebody thought about going for a shot but I didn't and now
[262.14s -> 266.32s]  I'm thinking about time to go down here to the cart because nobody's here so I
[266.40s -> 269.04s]  jump down gonna come over to the staircase here and there's a little spy
[269.04s -> 272.12s]  I didn't know this before because I'm an idiot and I hurt dirt all the time when
[272.12s -> 275.68s]  I play spy I did not know that you could jump up these crates and boxes but I
[275.68s -> 279.88s]  end up doing it missed the stab but get it anyways I come down here there's a
[279.88s -> 283.56s]  pyro that I try and do a side stab to but I miss and obviously as a spy you
[283.56s -> 288.00s]  want to run like hell from a pyro that knows you're around jump down here here
[288.00s -> 292.00s]  we go he's gonna come after me I'm waiting for him boom nice little shot
[292.00s -> 296.29s]  get the kill oh am I gonna die nope just barely miss bumping into the spy
[296.29s -> 299.05s]  coming in who was doing the same thing I did trying to get health and some
[299.05s -> 302.65s]  cloak so now we come up to the cart here I want to try and make this happen
[302.65s -> 306.57s]  because nobody's pushing it really so me and this pyro get on it and I'm a cart
[306.57s -> 311.33s]  spy now it's like heavy get down here like where are you going like come over
[311.33s -> 315.49s]  here and get on the cart but anyways this is now headshot mania right here
[315.49s -> 319.51s]  there's one don't get the kill it doesn't matter there's two I get the
[319.51s -> 322.17s]  assist for this though and now here comes another couple headshots on the
[322.17s -> 326.09s]  snipers finally the snipers ended up coming up to that roost there's one
[326.09s -> 330.17s]  and do I get the kill and there's a headshot kill right there now our team
[330.17s -> 333.17s]  is just all pushing the cart I figured that we have this in the bag there's like
[333.17s -> 336.77s]  four or five here so I take a trip down here I'm not gonna cap it there's no
[336.77s -> 339.65s]  reason for me to be here I'm gonna try and pick off people that come out of the
[339.65s -> 343.13s]  spawn and nobody really comes out they all go the other direction so I kind of
[343.13s -> 346.37s]  went the wrong way but it's alright we still do fine so I come out of this
[346.37s -> 349.53s]  window trying to find somebody that I can't shoot that guy can't shoot that
[349.53s -> 352.49s]  guy so I just go over to the right side of the spawn and I end up getting a
[352.49s -> 356.73s]  heavy he just kind of comes out and he just bang gets him right there that's
[356.73s -> 360.73s]  gonna be the end of the gameplay guys thank you all so much for watching I
[360.73s -> 364.43s]  really appreciate all the support you guys give so I'll see you all next time
[364.43s -> 367.75s]  and take care everybody
