[0.31s -> 12.91s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with chapter 2 of
[12.91s -> 20.00s]  Nightmare House 2. And I'm just gonna go where we left off. I know a lot of you
[20.00s -> 28.41s]  guys wanted me to do the prologue and I absolutely will do that. I apologize.
[28.41s -> 31.21s]  I thought the prologue was just some kind of cutscene or something like that,
[31.21s -> 36.13s]  but that actually is Nightmare House 1, I think. So I will do that at the end of
[36.13s -> 39.29s]  this playthrough. I'll make sure to get that done. But in the meantime, let's go.
[39.81s -> 48.82s]  God, will you... What the hell? Enough with the jump scares in the first 11 seconds.
[48.82s -> 55.79s]  Anything over here? Get out of the way, you stupid thing. I have a gun at least
[55.79s -> 61.12s]  and I have bullets. I have... Turn up the flashlight. Radiology department. Never
[61.12s -> 65.14s]  lose hope hospital. Oh yeah, never lose hope except for the guy that like got
[65.14s -> 72.50s]  locked in there with a monster. God! How many shots does it take to kill a zombie?
[72.50s -> 80.01s]  Can I get in there? No. I only have 10 bullets. Are you absolutely kidding me?
[81.52s -> 83.68s]  X-ray, CT scan, MRI.
[91.04s -> 91.52s]  Okay.
[96.20s -> 102.72s]  Good to know. That's locked. This is locked. And come on, lucky number three.
[103.36s -> 110.87s]  They're all locked. Can I like break through or something? Oh, of course I can.
[112.78s -> 116.06s]  This guy's going to come alive, guaranteed. And like, he's going to start
[116.06s -> 124.28s]  attacking me and I'm going to scream. Three, two, one. Nope. I could do without
[124.32s -> 135.26s]  the flashbang in my face. All right, this is gruesome. Oh my God. Get this guy on
[135.26s -> 139.53s]  the wheelchair. Something horrible is going to happen right now. I'll take an
[139.53s -> 147.89s]  ice cold. I'll take an ice cold Dr. Pepper. I didn't even read the tagline. So
[147.89s -> 153.45s]  cold, it'll make you S bricks. I knew it was going to happen. What am I? Can I
[153.45s -> 160.12s]  like just hit him? I'm just like playing patty cake with this guy like, die, die,
[160.12s -> 170.74s]  die. Danger. Admitance to authorize personnel only. Which means me get some
[170.74s -> 182.31s]  recharge my light. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Health kit. Probably shouldn't have
[182.31s -> 192.89s]  done that. Anything here? No. Where am I even supposed to be going? I don't like
[192.89s -> 211.30s]  that TV. Okay. Well, can I like make a collect call to my mother? Hi, Ma. It's
[211.30s -> 214.22s]  me. I just wanted to let you know that I'm in the middle of like a zombie like
[214.22s -> 221.63s]  apocalypse. And all the doors open. Okay, let's go into the radiology department.
[221.63s -> 225.87s]  All cell phones and electronic devices must turn this on. Oh,
[230.27s -> 233.51s]  yeah, I'm breaking the vital medical. I'm like smashing the medical equipment
[233.51s -> 239.57s]  right now. Anything even in here that I need to know about? A box of tissues can
[239.57s -> 247.58s]  blow my nose. Just keep going. Recharge the light. I can take this away.
[248.96s -> 260.26s]  To get in that door. Get out of here. Anything in here? Ooh. Bullets. Thank you
[260.26s -> 272.62s]  very much. I will take those. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? But what the
[272.62s -> 280.34s]  hell is going on? Come on here. I can't get out. I have no flashlight either. No.
[286.93s -> 295.04s]  God, why does she have to do that to me? What did I ever do to her? Okay. Oh, all
[295.04s -> 299.59s]  right. What do I do with this thing? I just drop it. All right, let's bring this
[299.59s -> 308.31s]  over here. Can I put this in here? Can I just fit in there? Just go in here. Go in
[308.31s -> 314.10s]  like that hole right there. Damn it. There's got to be a box right here
[314.10s -> 320.16s]  somewhere then, huh? I have no idea where to bring this damn thing. I'm just
[320.16s -> 329.97s]  carrying around this power supply. No, I have a feeling. What about in here?
[333.38s -> 337.27s]  There's another one. What's with these power supplies? Like, what am I supposed
[337.27s -> 351.21s]  to do with these things? What? What? What? What? God. Ow, my brain. Where did he go?
[352.98s -> 361.93s]  I didn't just do that, did I? Can I get in here? I can. No. No, stop. It's totally
[361.93s -> 374.13s]  black. No bullets. And all these things. I just don't know what to do with these
[374.13s -> 377.78s]  things. I keep pulling out the power supplies, but I don't know what to do
[377.78s -> 383.26s]  with them. Maybe I bring the... I think I know what to do. This one's glowing. Where
[383.26s -> 390.94s]  is he? Where is he? Son of a... God, there's a couple of them. Go for headshots.
[390.98s -> 391.78s]  There's three of them!
[396.32s -> 402.34s]  Get away from me! Get away from me! Okay. Definitely have to bring this back and
[402.34s -> 414.05s]  put that in the other one. For sure. In here, right? Get in there. All right, what
[414.05s -> 423.10s]  does that do? Is this operational now? It is. Okay. I have no idea what I just did,
[423.10s -> 432.60s]  but I did... Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. It's like everything's exploding. I can't... How am
[432.60s -> 442.61s]  I gonna get out of this room? Was that... What the hell? Was I supposed to do that?
[443.42s -> 459.78s]  What did I... Jeez. Now what? Oh, damn. It blew a hole in the wall. Okay. Get up
[459.78s -> 464.59s]  there, you bastard. Get up there. All right, we found a new little area here.
[464.59s -> 483.21s]  No. Where are you? I don't know where you are. Locked. Oh, I thought I just saw
[483.21s -> 488.42s]  something. My whole body just tingled right... What's going on? What's going on?
[488.42s -> 493.44s]  Why can't I... Why can't I do anything? Was that guy in, like, a gym suit? What the
[493.44s -> 501.79s]  hell was that? I do not like that. That guy... Oh, it's another vent. Oh, great.
[502.11s -> 520.54s]  Another vent. Okay. How do I get up there? Can I, like, jump on something? Um, the
[520.54s -> 527.34s]  wheelchair? Sorry, whoever that was. I needed to use it. First of all, I am going
[527.34s -> 528.34s]  to recharge this light.
[528.34s -> 561.70s]  Oh, that was ridiculous. Please don't just jump at me. What? How is that even
[561.70s -> 574.18s]  possible? That's impossible. Get out of my way. So glad I have a gun. Without this
[574.26s -> 594.66s]  gun. Hey. You can't even... Okay. They can't get in. That's okay. Yeah, no, no crap.
[597.75s -> 603.05s]  Oh, why isn't this guy here helping me with a gun or something? Go arm yourself
[603.05s -> 613.93s]  with a machine gun and get out here. Go get an assault rifle. Oh, I'm going to
[613.93s -> 629.34s]  throw up. Come on now, really? Get down. Storage. No, that's the... So what did I
[629.34s -> 635.67s]  just do? I came from here. This is the MRI machine. So I went down this way. Let
[635.67s -> 642.15s]  me try going over here now. No, I already went over here. Where is this girl? That
[642.15s -> 656.17s]  always means the girl's around. What the... Whoa. Hey. Well, that's not terrifying.
[656.17s -> 671.90s]  Get me out of here. Whoa. What? Oh, man. That's going to do it again, isn't it?
[671.90s -> 680.25s]  What the hell is that? Where's my flashlight? Where's my flashlight? There's
[680.25s -> 695.53s]  nowhere else to go. What is that? Is that a chair? It's a chair. Where am I? Where
[695.53s -> 717.70s]  am I? What's going on? Okay. Where am I? Where's my light? I think I'm alive. I'm
[717.70s -> 729.38s]  alive. That's good to know. Well, now what? Chapter three. All right, guys. Well,
[729.38s -> 736.20s]  that's going to be it for Scare Saturdays. Hope you enjoyed... That thing wasn't
[736.20s -> 745.72s]  human. That thing wasn't human. I will see you guys all next time, of course. And
[745.72s -> 747.48s]  take care, everybody.
