[2.68s -> 9.69s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[9.69s -> 14.69s]  And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Sniper with the new Sniper Rifle.
[14.69s -> 17.69s]  The classic, classic, the classic Sniper Rifle.
[17.69s -> 20.93s]  And I'm gonna give my thoughts on it. I'll tell you what I think about the item.
[20.93s -> 25.93s]  Do I think it's any good? Do I think it's any bad? Do I think you should craft it? Should you buy it? Should you sell it?
[25.93s -> 27.93s]  Sell it! Sell it! Sell it!
[27.93s -> 31.55s]  Okay, we'll get the weird out for now.
[31.55s -> 38.11s]  So, the Sniper Rifle in question, the classic, is a new rifle for the Sniper in the primary slot.
[38.11s -> 41.11s]  If you don't know how it works, I'm gonna give you a brief explanation of it.
[41.11s -> 48.35s]  This rifle is directly from Team Fortress Classic. If you don't know what that game is, it's essentially Team Fortress 1.
[48.35s -> 53.35s]  Although they were like a couple of different iterations of it, but Team Fortress Classic came before TF2.
[53.35s -> 58.35s]  And it was the standard, the regular Sniper Rifle in TFC was this item.
[58.35s -> 62.35s]  It was not the one you're used to in TF2. It was this one.
[62.35s -> 64.59s]  And how does it transition to TF2?
[64.59s -> 70.77s]  Well, it's hard to answer that question, because it's a very awkward item.
[70.77s -> 74.77s]  If you have never used the TF Classic weapon, if you've never played Team Fortress Classic,
[74.77s -> 79.94s]  this is a very strange and upside down, totally reversed way to play Sniper
[79.94s -> 83.94s]  out of the seven and a half years that this game has been out.
[83.94s -> 89.94s]  And I can understand that. I can understand how awkward and strange and messy this is when you first get it in your hands,
[89.94s -> 92.94s]  because it changes the entire world of Sniper.
[92.94s -> 97.94s]  You have to hold the button down. You have to hold fire down to charge.
[97.94s -> 100.94s]  You can't headshot somebody unless it's a fully charged shot.
[100.94s -> 103.94s]  And you have to let go of the button to shoot.
[103.94s -> 109.38s]  And this whole, what ends up happening is, you hold down left click to start the charge.
[109.38s -> 113.38s]  And then if you want to zoom in, you have to like hit right click while you're holding left click,
[113.38s -> 115.38s]  let go of left click.
[115.38s -> 118.38s]  I feel like I'm knitting a sweater when I play with this item. I really do.
[118.38s -> 122.38s]  I feel like I'm like about to when I look down at my mouse, it's going to be like a crocheted blanket.
[122.38s -> 125.68s]  And I'm going to go, oh, that's nice. I'm going to give that to my niece.
[125.68s -> 129.68s]  As goofy as that sounds, I really feel like my hands are being knitted together.
[129.68s -> 132.68s]  And it's something that you need to get used to.
[132.68s -> 134.68s]  Like I said, it reverses everything you know about the Sniper.
[134.68s -> 138.68s]  And you move really slowly when you actually hold the charge down.
[138.68s -> 142.68s]  I don't know if it's the same speed as the regular Sniper being zoomed in,
[142.68s -> 147.68s]  but I think it just feels slower because you can see more of what's going on around you.
[147.68s -> 149.68s]  And watch this demo man right here. I was laughing so hard at this.
[149.68s -> 152.82s]  Like why were you doing that?
[152.82s -> 155.12s]  Like he just got destroyed.
[155.12s -> 158.30s]  Anyways, we're going to move on from that. I lost my train of thought.
[158.30s -> 161.30s]  Oh yeah. We talked about the bad. I want to talk about the good.
[161.30s -> 165.30s]  There is something very specific here that this rifle has that none of the other ones do.
[165.30s -> 170.30s]  And I'm referring to the fact, like I just said, you can see the whole battlefield,
[170.30s -> 174.30s]  regardless if you have zero or a hundred percent charge.
[174.30s -> 179.30s]  I know everything that's happening around me before I even need to scope in.
[179.30s -> 181.30s]  On top of that, yeah, you can do no scopes.
[181.30s -> 183.30s]  You can do a lot of damage with the no scope.
[183.30s -> 187.30s]  But I think this adds the level of when you're playing with the Huntsman
[187.30s -> 190.30s]  and you have your peripheral vision still around, you don't have to worry.
[190.30s -> 194.30s]  If somebody's coming from my side right now, see right here, I'm shooting at the soldier.
[194.30s -> 197.30s]  If somebody's coming up to my left or right, I can see them.
[197.30s -> 199.30s]  You can't do that with any of the other rifles.
[199.30s -> 203.30s]  You have to scope in to be able to get the damage you need to get the kill, right?
[203.30s -> 205.30s]  And it gives you this sense of security.
[205.30s -> 209.30s]  You feel more safe while you're using this weapon.
[209.30s -> 213.30s]  Because even when you have to hard scope, you can still pull it down.
[213.30s -> 216.30s]  You can pull down the scope with still having the charge going.
[216.30s -> 219.30s]  So even if you think somebody might be behind you, might be behind you,
[219.30s -> 222.30s]  even if you think somebody might be behind you, you can still turn around,
[222.30s -> 225.30s]  whip around, take a look, and still have your charge going.
[225.30s -> 227.54s]  That's pretty huge.
[227.54s -> 230.54s]  And if you want me to give you a verdict here, if you want me to give you a,
[230.54s -> 233.54s]  what do you really think? Give it to us real.
[233.54s -> 235.54s]  Tell us the real story.
[235.54s -> 238.84s]  Well, I would probably say this is not the best sniper rifle in the game.
[238.84s -> 241.84s]  Is it fun to use? I think so.
[241.84s -> 245.84s]  And when I play Team Fortress 2, that's what matters to me.
[245.84s -> 247.84s]  Can I jump in? Am I going to have a good time?
[247.84s -> 249.84s]  Can I just mess around with this rifle?
[249.84s -> 252.84s]  Is it the best? No. Is it fun? Yeah.
[252.84s -> 255.84s]  So it's hard to give a letter grade to this.
[255.84s -> 257.84s]  It's messy. Yes, it's clumsy.
[257.84s -> 262.84s]  But getting that no-scope 450 on somebody is pretty satisfying,
[262.84s -> 265.84s]  and it's pretty interesting, and it's all in good fun.
[265.84s -> 268.84s]  And I'm glad to see that they're bringing stuff over from Team Fortress Classic.
[268.84s -> 271.84s]  I don't know if they're going to keep bringing stuff over.
[271.84s -> 273.84s]  I don't have any insider information on this.
[273.84s -> 278.84s]  It's just I like to see them paying homage to their Team Fortress Classic.
[278.84s -> 281.84s]  I think that's really interesting. I'm happy to see it here.
[281.84s -> 284.84s]  As much as you might not like it or as much as you might think it's great,
[284.84s -> 286.84s]  it's still cool nonetheless to see it in the game.
[286.84s -> 289.84s]  And that's my thoughts. That's my theory.
[289.84s -> 290.84s]  And that's what I got to say.
[290.84s -> 291.84s]  So that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[291.84s -> 294.84s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[294.84s -> 296.84s]  Let me know what you think in the comments.
[296.84s -> 297.84s]  And I'll see you all next time.
[297.84s -> 301.40s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
