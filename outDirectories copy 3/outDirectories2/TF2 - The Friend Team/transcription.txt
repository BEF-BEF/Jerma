I'm just going to sit over here on the team that's missing two people and wonder where my friends are. He's very dead. He's very dead. And this is this is stars. Sentry is in here. So we need to be very careful about this. All right. So we need to. Got it. You guys are having some fun over there.

Let's go take out this gun. Top. It's over on the left side. Left side. You're going to have to walk over this little incline. Oh, I see. I'm using it. I can't. I have no idea what's going on. I can't see anything. I think I'm shooting in the right direction. I have crits now too. Shit. Where? I can't see anything. Move up more. What are you doing? Dude, there was something.
[179.58s -> 213.30s]  Look at this. Oh, my God. Even in the right corner behind the one. You got to go. All right. Fine, dude. There was so much blood in my face. I couldn't see anything. I was taking so many hits from every direction that I couldn't see because there's too much blood splattered over here on the friend team. There's one top right. There's one over the left incline. And then next to top right, there's the little alleyway and there's like
[213.30s -> 245.12s]  three century nests in this little alley. All right. Where are the three? There are three following the track. All right, there's one. I'm using. Get that. There's two.

[261.89s -> 279.54s]  They are spread out far enough where it's not possible for us to kill them. Are you just arrowing me? Yeah. You, you, you. 600 health points worth of arrows. Help me. Help me. Shut up. Help me. Friend team.

[540.42s -> 541.94s]  Like I'm surrounded by morons.
[541.94s -> 544.74s]  I'm using a regular sticky launcher.
[544.74s -> 546.82s]  I'm not using the quickie launcher.
[546.82s -> 548.42s]  Oh, so like the completely broken thing
[548.42s -> 549.26s]  that does 100 damage per shot.
