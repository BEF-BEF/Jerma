[0.31s -> 12.44s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[12.44s -> 16.44s]  This Scare Saturday is going to be a little different than you're used to.
[16.44s -> 19.44s]  I'm actually going to be doing two games tonight.
[19.44s -> 25.44s]  And the reason for this is the first one that I do starts off really creepy and kind of scary,
[25.44s -> 29.44s]  and then just gets kind of gets comical. It gets like funny.
[29.44s -> 33.44s]  So instead of having just one short video where it's like four or five minutes long,
[33.44s -> 36.44s]  I'm going to do a second video as well. So this is like a double video.
[36.44s -> 42.44s]  It's two games in one. The first one is Lumber Island, and the second one is The Room.
[42.44s -> 44.44s]  Respective links will be in the description.
[44.44s -> 46.44s]  Let me know what you think about these two games.
[46.44s -> 52.44s]  The second one is pretty scary. It's a very, very, very, very bare bones independent project.
[52.44s -> 54.44s]  But we'll see how you guys enjoy them.
[54.44s -> 58.68s]  I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody. See you there.
[59.68s -> 67.95s]  Apparently I'm looking at a rock. Oh, well, whatever. That was weird.
[67.95s -> 79.69s]  Created by Dean Forge. I don't like how I can't see anything. Can I sprint? Not really.
[79.69s -> 86.34s]  Chapter one, the letter. I feel like I'm playing Slender right now.
[86.34s -> 104.78s]  What's up, bird? Oh, a campfire. I'm going to go toast some marshmallows.
[104.78s -> 117.71s]  A little teddy. OK, should I pick it up? What can I do here? Oh, I got it. OK.
[117.71s -> 122.46s]  What the hell? That's pretty eerie. It's just like a teddy rockspin.
[122.46s -> 127.43s]  Can I do anything else? I don't think I can even do anything else.
[127.43s -> 140.58s]  All right. Well, I got my teddy bear. What do I do now? What's that say?
[140.58s -> 144.58s]  Welcome to the Lumber Island, a place you will never forget.
[144.58s -> 149.01s]  And the brawny paper towel man is like here to welcome you.
[149.01s -> 154.27s]  Remember, use brawny when you got those big messes to clean up.
[154.27s -> 162.09s]  They came again. Now with the threats. I don't know how much longer I hold up, but I'll never sell my land.
[162.09s -> 172.34s]  OK, go back to close. Oh, right. That's the camera.
[172.34s -> 179.73s]  What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah. Yes. What's with the music?
[179.73s -> 195.26s]  What is with this music? Oh, my God. I don't think he has a head.
[195.26s -> 204.47s]  Oh, my God. He doesn't have a head. What do I do? What do I do?
[204.47s -> 210.21s]  What do I do? Just run away from this dude.
[210.21s -> 219.59s]  The headless brawny paper towel man. Don't get stuck on a rock. Go.
[219.59s -> 231.33s]  What do I do? Is this going to be something like can I get like a gun?
[231.33s -> 244.55s]  Can I shoot this guy? Oh, it's like Michael Myers.
[244.55s -> 250.52s]  Oh, I put the I put the teddy bear down. What's why? What's with the mist?
[250.52s -> 262.78s]  Get away from me, bro. I'm going to I'm going to try and find his boots
[262.78s -> 272.64s]  because he's pissed off. That's why he's going. He's kind of slow.
[272.64s -> 287.04s]  He's not the fastest. He's not the fastest man, but he is big and he's got an axe.
[287.04s -> 302.14s]  Let's get a good look at this guy. He's really slow.
[302.14s -> 307.38s]  I kind of feel bad for this guy right now. Like he wants to catch me,
[307.38s -> 310.38s]  but he just he just ain't going to catch me. He's just not going to catch me.
[310.38s -> 321.35s]  What if I can I get back in the boat? Will he come like into the boat?
[321.35s -> 323.35s]  I don't think he realizes he can like come over here. Let's see.
[323.35s -> 332.71s]  Let's see what happens. Does he does he come in the boat?
[332.71s -> 351.04s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the slug monster. Don't kill me.
[351.04s -> 362.02s]  Sir, excuse me. So new game. Let's go.
[362.02s -> 367.86s]  I like the rain. The rain can clear everything.
[367.86s -> 373.86s]  Wash the dirty things from me. Dirty things like sand, mud, blood or sin.
[373.86s -> 377.17s]  This is like a bad teleprompter. Can I make this like go faster?
[377.17s -> 387.43s]  What I do. What can you see in this picture? A sad face, praying or a rose?
[387.43s -> 392.63s]  Um, I think I see if I'm not going to lie. I see a face. That's a sad face.
[392.63s -> 395.87s]  I see. And what do what do you think about this one?
[395.87s -> 401.75s]  What is this like a psychology test? A crown, castle or horns?
[401.75s -> 407.34s]  I kind of looks like I'm going to say castle. I would say castle.
[407.34s -> 409.90s]  Great stronghold. That's surprising.
[409.90s -> 414.90s]  Once again, it's a fairies screaming or a puppy.
[414.90s -> 419.02s]  I see a puppy. That looks like a cute little note there.
[419.02s -> 427.21s]  You can. Okay. So what the hell? What was that all about?
[427.21s -> 434.70s]  Simple metal table with some stuff on it. My bed. I'm not tired yet.
[434.70s -> 438.70s]  This is the guy's house. This is like a wicked screwed up house.
[438.70s -> 441.87s]  If you ask me. Get out of the way.
[441.87s -> 449.98s]  I have a giant poster of internal organs. What's that?
[449.98s -> 452.98s]  What's that? Oh, it's my daughter. Hello, daughter.
[452.98s -> 459.59s]  What the hell do I do? Can I like leave this room?
[459.59s -> 464.96s]  It is called the room probably for a reason. I don't like the FOV, man.
[464.96s -> 473.14s]  Closed. All right. I get it. It's closed.
[473.14s -> 479.64s]  Really? What? I really like the rain. Please. Someone can hear me.
[479.64s -> 482.64s]  It was just using, you know, that sound that was like the AOL instant messenger.
[482.64s -> 491.98s]  Somebody just signed off noise to move these boxes.
[491.98s -> 494.98s]  Simple wooden crates. I don't know why. What did that say? Why they're here.
[494.98s -> 501.36s]  A vent. You can always go in the vent. I know this from experience.
[501.36s -> 510.37s]  Move out of the way. I feel like I'm looking through. Yeah, the rain did stop.
[510.37s -> 516.64s]  Why? Did the rain stop? I don't like this.
[531.30s -> 538.62s]  I don't know what to do. This is not cool.
[538.62s -> 542.98s]  Picture of a little girl. I don't remember who it is. Who is she? I don't know.
[542.98s -> 552.34s]  This is your house. I can't move. Wait, one of the pictures looks different.
[552.34s -> 563.51s]  My memory isn't good. What? Hi. Over the window? What? What do you mean over the window?
[563.51s -> 565.51s]  Over the window? What does that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean?
[565.51s -> 584.62s]  I feel like the whole world's closing in. Can I jump? Shut up.
[584.62s -> 590.65s]  Can I go in the vent? Wind coming from here. If I can open it, maybe I can escape.
[590.65s -> 600.98s]  I can't even tell what's happening, let alone like there's like a crowbar I can grab.
[600.98s -> 607.30s]  Anyone's out there, please. No answer. Fucking bulletproof glass. No one can hear me.
[607.30s -> 615.30s]  So am I going like crazy inside my own head or something?
[615.30s -> 627.68s]  Crow. I'll go to sleep. Oh, I'm supposed to go to sleep. Go to sleep.
[627.68s -> 631.69s]  It's late. Bad day. Really need to... Okay, so I went to sleep, I think.
[631.69s -> 646.20s]  Geez. What? I'm like a murderer? Is this like my prison cell?
[646.20s -> 651.96s]  Who are you? Where are you? Answer me, you son of a bitch.
[651.96s -> 656.82s]  You want to play? Show yourself. It's written in blood. Are you kidding me? Yeah.
[656.82s -> 667.39s]  Stop with this. Stop. With. Your. Bullshit.
[667.39s -> 688.29s]  I wish I could... Huh? Yes? What is in there? What is in here?
[688.29s -> 694.13s]  It looks like a corpse? What the hell happened? Who made this? Where am I? I must escape.
[694.13s -> 699.33s]  A corp... Ah! Gina! Gina! Hi! Gina! Hi! Lady!
[699.33s -> 709.08s]  Lady? It's like my friend... My friend got smashed and she got hurt.
[709.08s -> 716.35s]  Go to bed. Go back to bed. Go back to bed. Go back to bed. It's just a dream.
[716.35s -> 730.24s]  This is a stupid dream. Small coin. I can take it.
[730.24s -> 739.27s]  Did I pick it up? Did I just pick up the coin? Shut up, baby!
[739.27s -> 743.34s]  I don't have time for you. Can I like... Can I now... Can I open this?
[743.34s -> 751.79s]  Maybe this will work. Okay, I think I opened it.
[751.79s -> 760.65s]  Oh! Yes! I can't go any further. Here lies a rat. Disgusting. But eat them?
[760.65s -> 767.62s]  Do I want to eat the rat? I don't think I want to eat a rat. No, I'm not eating a rat.
[767.62s -> 772.91s]  I have to eat this rat to go further? Okay, eat the rat.
[772.91s -> 791.16s]  Go! Go! Go! Go! What the hell? I can't do anything there?
[791.16s -> 796.30s]  Please tell me I can leave now. Whoa! That's puke. That's my vomit.
[796.30s -> 801.07s]  It's still closed. Can I go to bed now, please?
[801.07s -> 814.50s]  I'm not tired yet. Can I open these things with the coin, too?
[814.50s -> 823.29s]  No, it's locked. No, it's locked. What does this like throw up do for me?
[823.29s -> 831.46s]  What's this? Small bobby pin. I can open the locker. I can open the locker.
[831.46s -> 840.59s]  Guarantee it. What? What? Can I open the door with this?
[840.59s -> 849.96s]  I can leave this cursed room. Finally, I'm out. I can leave this strange place.
[849.96s -> 860.44s]  But what the? No one's here. Hello? Someone can hear me?
[860.44s -> 866.44s]  So there you have it, guys. That's a dual Scare Saturday today because the games are pretty short.
[866.44s -> 870.44s]  So we'll see how that works out. If you guys want to see more, please let me know.
[870.44s -> 873.44s]  Links will be in the description for both of these games.
[873.44s -> 877.44s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
