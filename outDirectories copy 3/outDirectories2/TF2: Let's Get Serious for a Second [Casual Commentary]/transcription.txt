[0.31s -> 14.89s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.89s -> 23.06s]  And tonight, I'm not sure what I'm gonna be playing as, and it doesn't really matter, because this video is not gonna talk about Team Fortress 2.
[23.06s -> 27.30s]  It's not gonna talk about Smite. I don't know why I just brought up Smite.
[27.30s -> 40.58s]  There hasn't been a Smite video on this channel in like 70 years, but it's gonna talk about how this whole YouTube thing has truly been the most humbling experience of my entire life.
[40.58s -> 49.76s]  And this is not a subscriber milestone video. It's not like, thank you for 150,000 subscribers. No, this is not like any video like that.
[49.76s -> 55.76s]  It's just something I've wanted to do for a long time, is talk about this in a little bit more detail than I ever have.
[55.76s -> 62.50s]  And I figured it would be a good idea to do it right now, because I'm in the mood to talk about it.
[62.50s -> 65.50s]  So what am I getting at here? What's the point here? What am I talking about?
[65.50s -> 73.50s]  I'm talking about when people send me comments or tweets or personal messages. I read them all. I really do, I promise you guys.
[73.50s -> 80.50s]  I read all the comments, I read all the tweets, I read all the personal messages. It's just too much to ever be able to reply to them.
[80.50s -> 87.50s]  I think Gabe Newell famously said, I don't reply to them all, but I do read them all, talking about emails.
[87.50s -> 92.86s]  I'm the same way. I can't reply to them, but I do read them and I do appreciate them.
[92.86s -> 101.47s]  But why I bring up this topic of comments and people sending me messages is, what I get a lot of times in any of my inboxes
[101.47s -> 110.47s]  are people telling me that the videos that I make, the content I make, whether it's a comedy video or a discussion video, anything, it helps out their life.
[110.47s -> 117.47s]  They watch it and they feel better about themselves, they feel better about the world, they're going through depression, they're going through some tough times.
[117.47s -> 122.65s]  And they watch these videos from just from a YouTuber like me and it helps them out.
[122.65s -> 129.27s]  And I'm not going to solely say that like, oh, it's just because I'm such a good, it's a lot of different people.
[129.27s -> 134.27s]  There's a lot of people on this website that make fantastic content, very uplifting, fun, awesome content.
[134.27s -> 138.27s]  I'm not the only one that makes videos. There's plenty of other people.
[138.27s -> 147.75s]  But knowing that what I'm doing could potentially be helping somebody else in a much deeper way than I ever could possibly have imagined is life changing.
[147.75s -> 155.55s]  Being able to directly impact somebody else's life through video content is amazing.
[155.55s -> 159.55s]  And I really, truly hope that I can help out in any way I can, guys.
[159.55s -> 165.92s]  If you're watching the videos for fun and then you move on, if you're watching the videos to get away from something, I'm glad I'm here.
[165.92s -> 169.92s]  I'm glad there's a lot of us here on this site that can help you do that, that can help you through that.
[169.92s -> 175.10s]  And I mean that from the very bottom of my soul. I really do mean that.
[175.10s -> 182.07s]  A lot of you guys already know this. I've went through fucking all kinds of depression in the last, you know, 10 years.
[182.07s -> 186.07s]  I'm not perfect. I'm not a perfect guy. Like, I'm not.
[186.07s -> 189.07s]  I've gone through plenty of problems in my life. And I've gone through plenty of issues.
[189.07s -> 193.07s]  And I've gone through plenty of times where I've been like, you know what? Fuck it.
[193.07s -> 198.70s]  But the more you dwell on stuff like that, the more you're going to bring yourself down into a place you don't want to be.
[198.70s -> 202.70s]  You don't want to be there. Trust me on that. You do not want to be there.
[202.70s -> 207.70s]  You want to be up. You want to be high. You want to be on the mountain. You want to be shouting from the mountaintops, baby.
[207.70s -> 210.70s]  Sawmill. That was a reference to one of Star's videos. But whatever.
[210.70s -> 213.94s]  You want to be in a position where you're happy.
[213.94s -> 221.74s]  And if I can help you get there, if I can help you do that with these videos, then god damn it, I'm going to keep doing it.
[221.74s -> 226.74s]  And I'm going to try my absolute hardest to make the best videos I can.
[226.74s -> 229.74s]  To make the funniest videos I can. To make the most entertaining videos I can.
[229.74s -> 232.74s]  That's what I'm all about. That's what this channel is all about.
[232.74s -> 238.98s]  This channel is not about anything else. That's the number one thing. That's the number two thing.
[238.98s -> 243.98s]  That's the number three thing. The top three things of my channel are that.
[243.98s -> 245.98s]  And everything else is underneath.
[245.98s -> 253.47s]  And the whole purpose of this video, the whole reason why I made this video, why I opened up Audacity, why I started talking in the first place,
[253.47s -> 257.95s]  is to say thank you to those of you that have watched these videos.
[257.95s -> 261.19s]  That, you know, it's not a subscriber milestone, like I said in the beginning.
[261.19s -> 264.19s]  Not like, oh, 200k, no. I just want to say thanks.
[264.19s -> 273.54s]  Because me making videos that you guys enjoy, or that help out your life in some way, anyway, makes me want to be a better person.
[273.54s -> 279.54s]  Makes me want to strive to make better content, strive to make better videos, more entertaining things, have more ideas, more experiments.
[279.54s -> 283.54s]  It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jerma upstairs in my noggin lately.
[283.54s -> 285.54s]  Because I got a lot of ideas, and I want to do them.
[285.54s -> 288.30s]  But we're not going to go into that now.
[288.30s -> 292.54s]  And to close this video out, I'm only going to take about 30 seconds or so in this video,
[292.54s -> 298.72s]  because if you're having problems, if you're having real problems, talk to somebody.
[298.72s -> 301.72s]  You have to. You have to get in touch with somebody.
[301.72s -> 305.96s]  Because it's not healthy to stay mad, to stay depressed.
[305.96s -> 309.38s]  It's not a healthy thing. I know. I know.
[309.38s -> 311.38s]  Take it from me. I know.
[311.38s -> 315.38s]  You don't want to be sad. You don't want to be depressed about certain things.
[315.38s -> 319.38s]  You want a good old grandma for Christine to help you.
[319.38s -> 321.38s]  That's a new character. I don't know who that is.
[321.38s -> 323.68s]  You want to be happy. So try to get happy.
[323.68s -> 325.68s]  Try to find ways to make you happy.
[325.68s -> 329.86s]  And if I can make you happy, like I said, god damn it, I'm going to keep fucking doing it.
[329.86s -> 332.86s]  So thank you everybody for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[332.86s -> 336.16s]  I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
