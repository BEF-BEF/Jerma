[0.63s -> 5.75s]  Hey what is going on guys, Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[5.75s -> 11.35s]  Tonight by popular demand, I'm going to be playing as the medic class, showing you some things maybe
[11.35s -> 16.55s]  you didn't know before, some advanced techniques maybe I guess you could call it, how to do certain
[16.55s -> 21.43s]  things, why to do certain things in certain situations, playing on gold rush right now as
[21.43s -> 27.59s]  the regular Medigun medic with the crusaders crossbow and the amputator. You may be asking
[27.59s -> 32.71s]  Jerma why you're using those two items and if you do not know, when you put those two items on the
[32.71s -> 39.35s]  crossbow and the amputator, you get plus one extra health added per second on top of what you normally
[39.35s -> 45.67s]  get as a medic. So if you just want to play strict heal bot medic, which is what I'm doing right now,
[45.67s -> 50.87s]  you want to put those two items on because it just benefits you. If you want to play battle medic,
[50.87s -> 55.45s]  then yeah you might want to take these off, but this will just help you stay alive. So the first
[55.45s -> 60.41s]  medic tip I'm going to give you guys is probably the most important one. A lot of people still have
[60.41s -> 64.57s]  trouble with this and even though it seems kind of like a no-brainer, I'm just going to say it
[64.57s -> 72.60s]  anyways, make sure you heal everybody. Heal the spies, heal the snipers, make sure you don't neglect
[72.60s -> 77.88s]  anyone because I've seen it a lot. I've seen medics that just avoid all the spies, all the snipers,
[77.88s -> 81.56s]  ah you don't need it, you're a sniper, I'm not going to give it to you, but you really do. You
[81.56s -> 86.68s]  really have to give it to them because remember guys, this is Team Fortress 2. This isn't heavy
[86.68s -> 91.80s]  medic, heavy demo man 2. You want to make sure you spread the heals out as much as you can,
[91.80s -> 99.00s]  especially other medics. Insanely important guys, overheal your medics that are on your team because
[99.00s -> 104.36s]  they are the only thing that can heal anyone, unless of course it's an engineer's dispenser,
[104.36s -> 109.24s]  which you can't heal a dispenser with your beam, so the only other option is to heal the engineer,
[109.24s -> 115.16s]  which is still very, very important, going back to not neglecting anyone. You want everybody to
[115.16s -> 119.70s]  be overhealed. You want your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your neighbor's cat,
[119.70s -> 124.90s]  your neighbor's cat's boyfriend, your boyfriend's sister's brother-in-law. You want every single
[124.90s -> 131.34s]  person on your team to be as high health as they possibly can, and just go ahead and freeze it right
[131.34s -> 137.62s]  there for a second. Thanks buddy. So right now I want to talk about a few different Uber situations,
[137.62s -> 142.98s]  when to use your Uber, why to use it, what type of Ubers these are. So let's start with the first
[142.98s -> 152.58s]  one here. This is going to be called my medics cooler than your medic buddy Uber. So what this
[152.58s -> 159.18s]  entails is take a look at this heavy medic pair right here, right here. They are both on fire.
[159.18s -> 165.94s]  They are both hanging out together, but they don't pop their Uber because they don't have one. This
[165.94s -> 171.94s]  is a great situation to be in because if you can tell, if you know the other medic does not have an
[171.94s -> 177.38s]  Uber and you have one, you have a strict advantage and you can determine the outcome of the fight
[177.38s -> 183.16s]  because we can pop our Uber and they will just get smoked. So the way to tell this is like I said,
[183.16s -> 188.28s]  they were both on fire. They're both taking heavy amounts of damage. Usually in this situation,
[188.28s -> 193.88s]  a medic will pop the Uber to protect himself and to protect obviously the person he's healing.
[193.96s -> 198.28s]  So us knowing that I popped the Uber to protect both of us from any incoming fire,
[198.28s -> 205.37s]  they both get exploded by the stickies. Victory for the blue team. So the next one I'm going to
[205.37s -> 211.91s]  cover is something I like to call the team Uber and it's pretty self-explanatory, the title in
[211.91s -> 219.21s]  itself. You're going to be Ubering the entire team at the same time. Why would you ever do this and
[219.21s -> 224.41s]  why would you ever need to do this? Here is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
[224.41s -> 228.33s]  We're all trying to get out of the spawn. We're being spawn camped. We're being crushed by the
[228.33s -> 235.05s]  enemy team and a pyro comes up behind us and starts to spray everybody. I have my Uber.
[235.05s -> 242.65s]  I pop it and here we go. Watch what I do. I turn around and just start right clicking on everyone.
[242.65s -> 248.57s]  So at the same time, there's about five or six people that have an Uber, which allows us to push
[248.57s -> 253.54s]  out of the spawn and get the hell out of there. So the mechanics behind this and the reasoning
[253.54s -> 261.78s]  behind this is because guys, one second in Team Fortress is a very long time. One full two seconds,
[261.78s -> 270.14s]  one second, one, two of taking absolute zero damage is a huge deal in this game. If you can
[270.14s -> 275.10s]  protect your teammates for a couple seconds just getting out of that spawn door and getting out of
[275.10s -> 281.82s]  the spawn area, you'll have way more potential than you ever did if you didn't use this technique.
[281.82s -> 287.34s]  The next Uber technique I want to talk about is something I like to call the transition Uber.
[287.34s -> 291.74s]  How this one works is this is pretty similar to the last one. The only difference is you're going
[291.74s -> 296.54s]  to be doing it to less people. So instead of Ubering five or six people, you're going to be
[296.54s -> 302.42s]  doing it to two people and you're not going to be doing it at the same time. This is the century
[302.42s -> 307.06s]  killer guys. This is a great way to take out a pesky century. If you can communicate with your
[307.06s -> 311.54s]  teammates, if they know what's going on, these guys didn't. I did this pretty much on my own,
[311.54s -> 317.32s]  but if you can communicate with people, you can get double fire on a century and pretty much
[317.32s -> 323.43s]  guaranteeing its destruction. Coming back to reality here now, just wanted to give you guys
[323.43s -> 328.15s]  some of my techniques, some of the ways that I play medic. Hopefully you can see some information
[328.15s -> 332.71s]  in those. If you don't end up doing them, that's fine. Just as long as you take something out of
[332.71s -> 339.00s]  it. That's all I care about. Troll Uber right here. I went to Uber that spy just for a joke
[339.00s -> 343.50s]  because I knew we were going to win. We were rolling this entire time. So I get second place
[343.50s -> 347.58s]  on the scoreboard as a medic, which always feels good. It always feels good to be number one or
[347.58s -> 352.52s]  number two as a medic. Makes you feel nice. So thank you everybody so much for watching. You
[352.52s -> 357.24s]  know, I really do appreciate it. If you liked this video or if it helped you, please by all means,
[357.24s -> 361.96s]  shoot me a like and I will see you all next time. Take care everybody.
