[1.85s -> 5.85s]  Yo, what is up guys? It's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.
[5.85s -> 8.85s]  This time I am on King of the Hill Viaduct.
[8.85s -> 10.85s]  There's actually gonna be two gameplays in this commentary.
[10.85s -> 15.85s]  There's gonna be one on Viaduct and then one on Turbine, Capture the Flag Turbine.
[15.85s -> 18.85s]  These gameplays were taken from my event that I had this afternoon,
[18.85s -> 22.85s]  where I made everybody flood an empty server.
[22.85s -> 26.85s]  I know that a lot of you guys had some bad ping and I'm really, really sorry about that,
[26.85s -> 30.85s]  but it will get better over time. I plan on getting my own server at some point here,
[30.85s -> 34.02s]  so let's get into the gameplay. This is an engineer, combat engineer,
[34.02s -> 39.02s]  using the Mini-Sentry, the Frontier Justice, and the Pistol, I believe.
[39.02s -> 41.46s]  Yep, the Pistol.
[41.46s -> 44.46s]  So my Mini-Sentry here gets three or four assists in a row,
[44.46s -> 48.46s]  and I get a couple kills with it, which allows me to switch over to the Frontier Justice
[48.46s -> 52.46s]  and get the Revenge crits. I destroy it, come over here,
[52.46s -> 55.46s]  this spy just destroys one of my teammates, but I get him right in the back.
[55.46s -> 57.46s]  This jumping Demoman goes down, too.
[58.46s -> 62.46s]  And then I get backstabbed by Larry, the combat spy,
[62.46s -> 68.46s]  who had it out for me the whole afternoon, and I was raging Cajun, man.
[68.46s -> 70.46s]  I'm telling you right now, I was raging Cajun.
[70.46s -> 74.87s]  So anyways, guys, if you haven't checked out the Borderlands let's play
[74.87s -> 76.87s]  that me and Leptor are doing right now, go check it out.
[76.87s -> 78.87s]  That's where I've been for the last couple days.
[78.87s -> 81.87s]  We've recorded a lot of footage, so I hope you guys check it out.
[81.87s -> 83.87s]  Go over to Leptor's channel and check that out.
[83.87s -> 86.30s]  Getting this teleporter up to level three,
[86.30s -> 88.30s]  which you never see people do this on a King of the Hill map,
[88.30s -> 91.30s]  which is very, very important because level three teleporters
[91.30s -> 95.30s]  make this insanely easy for your team just to get right to the front lines.
[95.30s -> 98.30s]  I somehow kill somebody. Who did I just kill right there?
[98.30s -> 100.54s]  Was that a disguised spy that I killed with that pistol?
[100.54s -> 103.54s]  I just had no idea. So I turn around, this guy's on fire.
[103.54s -> 106.54s]  He goes down with a couple of shots from the shotgun.
[106.54s -> 108.54s]  This Pyro, I knew he was going to come up here.
[108.54s -> 110.54s]  I'm trying to lure him up here with the Mini-Sentry.
[110.54s -> 112.54s]  I end up doing a great job of it. He gets killed.
[112.54s -> 115.98s]  Trying to get a little bit healthier. I thought the health was going to respawn,
[115.98s -> 116.98s]  but there's a dispenser.
[116.98s -> 118.98s]  There was like two other engineers that were on the team,
[118.98s -> 122.54s]  so it actually worked out pretty well.
[122.54s -> 125.54s]  So I go down by a Mini-Sentry from the other team.
[125.54s -> 128.54s]  Captain Defender had one place in a good spot.
[128.54s -> 131.54s]  And then Famous Amos, just being a real psycho,
[131.54s -> 133.54s]  comes over and tries to repair my Mini-Sentry.
[133.54s -> 135.54s]  And I'm not sure if he knows that or not,
[135.54s -> 138.54s]  but Famous Amos, dude, you're the man for trying anyways.
[138.54s -> 139.54s]  I appreciate it.
[139.54s -> 140.90s]  So let's respawn here.
[140.90s -> 143.90s]  Come out, get in my teleporter that I built to level three.
[143.90s -> 145.90s]  And this is where things get a little kooky
[145.90s -> 147.90s]  because there's just too much crap going on.
[147.90s -> 150.21s]  I come over here with the Mini-Sentry placed,
[150.21s -> 152.21s]  and there's an Uber charge.
[152.21s -> 154.21s]  I run out of the way because I'm not going to get myself killed
[154.21s -> 156.21s]  and wait for like a 25-second respawn.
[156.21s -> 158.21s]  Double engineers building up a dispenser to level three.
[158.21s -> 163.21s]  And then Larry, the combat spy, again gets me with a backstab.
[163.21s -> 165.21s]  So that's not good.
[165.21s -> 167.21s]  But what is good is the fact that my Mini-Sentry
[167.21s -> 169.21s]  has got a couple more assists before it goes down.
[169.21s -> 172.21s]  So we have less than a minute left.
[172.21s -> 174.21s]  They haven't even gotten onto the point yet,
[174.21s -> 177.21s]  which is good because we are probably going to win this round.
[177.21s -> 179.45s]  There's an engineer on the other team trying to build
[179.45s -> 181.45s]  a big Sentry up on the top right corner.
[181.45s -> 184.45s]  It does end up going up, which causes a little bit of problem,
[184.45s -> 186.45s]  but it's okay.
[186.45s -> 188.45s]  Our teammates are doing well enough where it's not a big deal.
[188.45s -> 191.45s]  I almost die from it, but I end up hiding in this corner,
[191.45s -> 193.45s]  and I'm not going to get myself killed by that.
[193.45s -> 197.20s]  My Mini-Sentry gets an assist, and I get the revenge crits
[197.20s -> 200.20s]  trying to get something happening, trying to get something going.
[200.20s -> 203.20s]  Build a little Mini-Sentry just to keep this point secure.
[203.20s -> 205.20s]  I thought I missed that engineer, but I guess I hit him
[205.20s -> 207.20s]  with the tail end of a pellet.
[207.20s -> 210.20s]  So now I try and do some sneaky spy bullshit,
[210.20s -> 211.20s]  and it doesn't work.
[211.20s -> 212.20s]  You'll see what I'm talking about.
[212.20s -> 214.20s]  I get behind everybody, and then watch this.
[214.20s -> 215.20s]  I'm going to get this guy. Ready?
[215.20s -> 217.20s]  One, two, three.
[217.20s -> 219.20s]  No, it didn't work.
[219.20s -> 221.20s]  And I just die.
[221.20s -> 223.20s]  But that would have been really funny if it worked.
[223.20s -> 225.20s]  I probably should have tried to taunt kill them or something,
[225.20s -> 228.20s]  but we end up winning the game with a flawless victory.
[228.20s -> 231.20s]  German number one, baby, even though it doesn't even matter who cares.
[231.20s -> 233.20s]  We're just playing for fun here.
[233.20s -> 235.20s]  And now we're going to move on to a medic gameplay.
[235.20s -> 236.20s]  Not really a medic gameplay.
[236.20s -> 239.20s]  I just want to kind of showcase the quick fix
[239.20s -> 241.20s]  and why I found a couple of good uses for it
[241.20s -> 244.20s]  and why I changed my mind on it a little, I guess.
[244.20s -> 247.76s]  So the loadout for this match is going to be the quick fix,
[247.76s -> 250.94s]  the ubersaw, and the overdose.
[250.94s -> 252.94s]  I find this to be a very, very interesting setup
[252.94s -> 256.94s]  because it allows you to be a combat medic, a real combat medic,
[256.94s -> 260.94s]  because you can run faster when you have uber charge on the overdose.
[260.94s -> 263.94s]  So it allows you to run around really fast and smash people like this.
[263.94s -> 267.94s]  Even though he's disguised and he was a dead ringer, it's okay.
[267.94s -> 269.94s]  I still made him have to use his cloak.
[269.94s -> 273.56s]  So let me show you now a good reason to use the quick fix.
[273.56s -> 274.56s]  This is a good example right here.
[274.56s -> 276.56s]  Three or four people in a row come over to me
[276.56s -> 279.56s]  and I heal them all to full health within five seconds,
[279.56s -> 281.56s]  which you would not be able to do with any of the other medic guns.
[281.56s -> 285.56s]  It's huge because now these three guys, these four guys now,
[285.56s -> 288.56s]  have full health, ready to run to the flag to get it.
[288.56s -> 290.56s]  And now I have an uber charge,
[290.56s -> 293.56s]  and this is where it really, really, really, really is cool
[293.56s -> 294.56s]  because you'll see what happens.
[294.56s -> 296.56s]  The guy with the flag really starts...
[296.56s -> 297.56s]  Oh, watch this, by the way.
[297.56s -> 298.56s]  Nice, like, fail.
[298.56s -> 299.56s]  Dude, let me, like, jump the fence.
[299.56s -> 300.56s]  Oh, no, I've got to walk over it.
[300.56s -> 302.56s]  So this is a great example right here.
[302.56s -> 303.56s]  I pop it.
[303.56s -> 304.56s]  These two people need health bad.
[304.56s -> 305.56s]  Boom, boom.
[305.56s -> 307.56s]  Full health automatically.
[307.56s -> 308.56s]  Amazing.
[308.56s -> 309.56s]  Really, really cool.
[309.56s -> 313.56s]  If I had the regular medic gun, I would be able to uber charge one person
[313.56s -> 315.56s]  and the rest of them would just die.
[315.56s -> 316.56s]  With the Kritzkrieg,
[316.56s -> 318.56s]  I would have had to just give somebody Kritz
[318.56s -> 319.56s]  and they could have just died instantly
[319.56s -> 321.56s]  from just somebody spamming with a rocket or something,
[321.56s -> 322.56s]  but not with the quick fix.
[322.56s -> 326.56s]  If you're using the quick fix, especially on a capture-the-flag map,
[326.56s -> 330.56s]  everybody's trying to protect this one person that has the flag.
[330.56s -> 334.56s]  And Turbine, Turbine is a pretty small quarters capture-the-flag map,
[334.56s -> 338.56s]  so everybody's kind of in that one middle area if somebody has the flag.
[338.56s -> 340.56s]  In a place like Two Fort, there's, like, five different places you can go.
[340.56s -> 343.56s]  The sewers, you can go around the top if you're a soldier,
[343.56s -> 344.56s]  you can go down the bottom.
[344.56s -> 346.56s]  But Turbine, you really need to protect your teammates,
[346.56s -> 348.56s]  especially the guy with the flag.
[348.56s -> 350.56s]  And that guy had, like, five health left.
[350.56s -> 353.56s]  And even if I uber charged him, the sniper that was next to him,
[353.56s -> 356.56s]  the other medic that was right there, probably could have just died.
[356.56s -> 358.56s]  And then by the time that the uber charge is done,
[358.56s -> 360.56s]  if you have the regular medic gun,
[360.56s -> 362.56s]  you're talking about it's you versus the world.
[362.56s -> 364.56s]  You and the soldier versus the world.
[364.56s -> 367.56s]  So it's great to have the quick fix and keep everybody on the same page.
[367.56s -> 371.06s]  That's why it's a fantastic new item.
[371.06s -> 374.06s]  Anyways, you'll notice that there was a cut.
[374.06s -> 376.06s]  And what I'm doing is I don't want to show a full gameplay
[376.06s -> 379.06s]  because I didn't really do that good in this particular gameplay.
[379.06s -> 381.06s]  I was getting kind of owned by a lot of people.
[381.06s -> 385.06s]  But this is a good example of why I underestimated the quick fix
[385.06s -> 387.06s]  and why I will not underestimate it anymore.
[387.06s -> 389.06s]  This spy goes down from Bacon.
[389.06s -> 392.06s]  And me and Bacon really, really rip shit up right here
[392.06s -> 394.06s]  because of the uber charge on this item.
[394.06s -> 396.06s]  I try to save this guy's life, but it doesn't work.
[396.06s -> 398.06s]  I uber charge Bacon and watch this.
[398.06s -> 403.30s]  He kills one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people
[403.30s -> 406.30s]  with the uber charge of the quick fix.
[406.30s -> 408.30s]  So Bacon, that was a pretty sick run.
[408.30s -> 411.30s]  And I will never, ever again pretend
[411.30s -> 414.30s]  like the uber charge on this item is not sufficient.
[414.30s -> 416.54s]  Come back over here with these two soldiers.
[416.54s -> 418.54s]  I get whipped, which makes this run really fast.
[418.54s -> 421.54s]  And we are going to cap this point, and we're going to win three to nothing.
[421.54s -> 424.54s]  I don't make it to the top of the charts, but that's okay.
[424.54s -> 426.54s]  These other guys did a fantastic job,
[426.54s -> 428.54s]  so I really appreciate them coming in.
[428.54s -> 430.54s]  This event was a lot of fun, guys.
[430.54s -> 432.54s]  I'll do a whole lot more of these.
[432.54s -> 434.54s]  And thank you for watching again so much.
[434.54s -> 436.54s]  I appreciate it.
[436.54s -> 439.54s]  And I promise you guys, sooner or later, I'll get my own damn server
[439.54s -> 442.54s]  so you don't have to deal with any of this bull crap anymore.
[442.54s -> 444.54s]  So thanks a lot, guys.
[444.54s -> 446.54s]  We filled the server. Let's do it again sometime soon.
[446.54s -> 448.54s]  Thanks a lot. Take care, guys.
