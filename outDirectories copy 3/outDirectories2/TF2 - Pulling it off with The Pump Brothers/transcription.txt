[0.31s -> 10.14s]  Are you playing on a server now?
[10.14s -> 13.83s]  Yeah. I told you I was fucking pumped up for like duty shit.
[13.83s -> 16.83s]  Yo, I'm pumped up right now. We're both pumped. Call us the Pump Brothers.
[16.83s -> 17.83s]  You wanna be the Pump Brothers?
[17.83s -> 19.14s]  No.
[19.14s -> 22.14s]  Yo, you don't wanna be the Pump Brothers?
[22.14s -> 23.14s]  I really don't actually.
[23.14s -> 25.14s]  You don't want me to pump you up? You don't want me to pump you?
[25.14s -> 30.74s]  I don't want you to pump me.
[30.74s -> 32.74s]  I think I'm just gonna spectate you.
[32.74s -> 35.74s]  I'm gonna teach you how to pull it off, Star. Are you ready for this?
[35.74s -> 38.74s]  I wanna see how to pull it off. Luigi, hee hee. Show me how to pull it off.
[38.74s -> 41.74s]  First of all, you wanna jump. No, this is important. You wanna jump up on this rail.
[41.74s -> 45.18s]  Jump up on these big spindydoodles.
[45.18s -> 48.18s]  Once you get on the top spindydoodle, then it's really important that you wait here.
[48.18s -> 50.18s]  My carcass is everywhere.
[50.18s -> 52.18s]  That door. You don't wanna go in that door.
[52.18s -> 53.42s]  Oh, yeah?
[53.42s -> 60.54s]  Go to the spindydoodle. Go. Just go. This is...
[60.54s -> 61.54s]  Hit something.
[61.54s -> 63.54s]  Don't worry. I'll pull this off. You wanna see how you pull it off?
[63.54s -> 64.85s]  Time to turn it on.
[64.85s -> 67.94s]  Turn it on.
[67.94s -> 68.94s]  That's how you pull it off, this one.
[68.94s -> 70.94s]  Oh my god. What a hip shot.
[70.94s -> 71.94s]  Hey!
[71.94s -> 72.94s]  Wasn't even aiming for him.
[72.94s -> 74.94s]  Wasn't even aiming for that guy.
[75.94s -> 78.27s]  Oh, there's a sentry over here.
[78.27s -> 80.27s]  Sentry. Spy, you gotta do your work. Get in there and get that sentry.
[80.27s -> 81.27s]  Get the health kit. Get the health kit.
[81.27s -> 83.27s]  I can't. There's a sentry right there. Are you stupid?
[83.27s -> 84.27s]  No.
[84.27s -> 89.18s]  Not as in the type of dream that you have that you didn't like,
[89.18s -> 91.18s]  but as in the Soul Calibur II character,
[91.18s -> 94.18s]  as in the 3-3-B is a very good launcher.
[94.18s -> 96.18s]  There's a lot of damage. I think 72 damage.
[96.18s -> 98.18s]  Okay, we're gonna watch you pull it off, man.
[98.18s -> 99.42s]  I'm gonna pull it off.
[99.42s -> 101.42s]  There's just mini sentry.
[101.42s -> 103.42s]  It doesn't count because there was a mini sentry.
[103.42s -> 104.42s]  Didn't pull it off.
[104.42s -> 106.42s]  No. Redo.
[106.42s -> 108.42s]  All right, fine. Redo.
[108.42s -> 110.42s]  You get one more shot to pull it off.
[110.42s -> 113.19s]  I'm gonna pull it off.
[113.19s -> 115.71s]  Ready?
[115.71s -> 117.71s]  This time the mini sentry won't get me.
[117.71s -> 118.71s]  All right.
[118.71s -> 120.71s]  Looks like he's gonna see a demo man around the corner.
[120.71s -> 122.71s]  No, no. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go...
[122.71s -> 124.71s]  It didn't pull it off again.
[124.71s -> 125.71s]  That doesn't count either
[125.71s -> 128.71s]  because he's the guy who builds mini sentries.
[128.71s -> 134.37s]  This is your final chance to pull it off.
[134.37s -> 137.37s]  Dude, I am just not pulling it off right now.
[137.37s -> 138.37s]  You have a chance, right? No.
[138.37s -> 141.37s]  Wow. You are just not pulling it off.
[141.37s -> 143.37s]  No, it does. It does.
[143.37s -> 144.37s]  That was three pulls.
[144.37s -> 146.37s]  No, it's my turn to pull it off.
[146.37s -> 148.37s]  No, it's three strikes. You're out.
[148.37s -> 149.37s]  Yeah, you're on strike four right now.
[149.37s -> 150.37s]  I'm pulling it off.
[150.37s -> 152.37s]  The first one didn't count because it was a mini sentry.
[152.37s -> 154.37s]  That's fine. I'm pulling it off.
[154.37s -> 156.37s]  I don't care. I'm not watching you because I'm about to pull it off.
[156.37s -> 159.37s]  No, that's fine. I'm pulling it off before you pull it off.
[159.37s -> 161.37s]  There's no way you're gonna be able to pull it off.
[161.37s -> 162.37s]  Oh, really? You think so?
[162.37s -> 164.37s]  I think so. Go for it. I'm going for the sentries.
[164.37s -> 166.37s]  If you pull it off before I pull it off...
[166.37s -> 168.37s]  If you pull it off before I pull it off before you pull it off,
[168.37s -> 172.66s]  then there's gonna be a big problem here.
[172.66s -> 174.66s]  No, no, no, no. Don't let up. Yeah, shoot him, Heavy.
[174.66s -> 178.66s]  There's two... I didn't pull it off.
[178.66s -> 181.66s]  This is like the worst I've played in my life.
[181.66s -> 183.66s]  I didn't pull it off either.
[183.66s -> 185.66s]  It's 13 seconds left to pull it off.
[185.66s -> 187.66s]  I mean, come on. One of us is gonna pull it off.
[187.66s -> 189.66s]  Somebody... Okay, I'm going demo.
[189.66s -> 191.66s]  Somebody has to really pull this off.
[191.66s -> 194.22s]  There's no time to get over here to pull it off.
[194.22s -> 196.22s]  Come on. You gotta pull it off.
[196.22s -> 198.22s]  I could pull it off if I had another minute.
[198.22s -> 199.22s]  This is a lot...
[199.22s -> 203.86s]  Okay, what's the lineup here? What are we looking at?
[203.86s -> 205.86s]  Punch heavies.
[205.86s -> 209.83s]  Both of us? Yes.
[209.83s -> 211.83s]  You know we're gonna meet? We have a specific meeting point.
[211.83s -> 214.14s]  No bullshit.
[214.14s -> 216.38s]  No trickery. No tomfoolery.
[216.38s -> 219.19s]  Okay, no attacking each other.
[219.19s -> 221.50s]  No bullshit.
[221.50s -> 223.50s]  No tomfoolery.
[223.50s -> 225.50s]  We just want a straight punch heavy fight.
[225.50s -> 243.61s]  No bullshit.
[243.61s -> 249.62s]  I think I found a way.
[249.62s -> 251.80s]  Oh, are you typing to someone?
[251.80s -> 254.04s]  I'm talking to MLC stuff.
[254.04s -> 266.38s]  I wouldn't do that if I were you.
[266.38s -> 268.38s]  Are you working with him?
[268.38s -> 271.06s]  Yeah, I've been typing to this sniper.
[271.06s -> 273.43s]  Just wait, he's gonna come.
[273.43s -> 275.43s]  Have you?
[275.43s -> 279.21s]  Yes.
[279.21s -> 281.21s]  He was sitting here just waiting, aiming down here.
[281.21s -> 283.21s]  This whole fucking time I've been typing.
[283.21s -> 288.71s]  Can you pull it off?
[288.71s -> 291.02s]  Yeah, I can pull it off. Just let me get the health.
[291.02s -> 293.32s]  And we'll have our battle royale.
[293.32s -> 295.50s]  Okay, you ready?
[295.50s -> 297.67s]  Wait, wait, wait. I'm not ready.
[297.67s -> 299.67s]  Okay, I'm ready.
[299.67s -> 301.67s]  Are you ready to have the actual battle royale?
[301.67s -> 306.09s]  Okay, battle royale.
[306.09s -> 308.39s]  Get that health.
[308.39s -> 313.00s]  Shit!
[313.00s -> 317.61s]  It's the same sniper.
[317.61s -> 319.61s]  That sniper almost got me again.
[319.61s -> 322.81s]  He was waiting in a corner to Dorati.
[322.81s -> 324.81s]  Are you instructing him on everything?
[324.81s -> 326.81s]  No, seriously, have you heard me type?
[326.81s -> 331.54s]  Alright, wait.
[331.54s -> 333.54s]  Kill him.
[333.54s -> 335.54s]  Oh my fucking god.
[335.54s -> 337.54s]  He just gunned you down.
[337.54s -> 340.68s]  He thought about it until you saw him think about it.
[340.68s -> 343.75s]  Invisible potty.
[343.75s -> 346.06s]  Have you ever read Invisible Weekly today?
[346.06s -> 348.06s]  I did.
[348.06s -> 350.30s]  I didn't like the part where it said we were a bunch of chumps.
[350.30s -> 352.30s]  That part was not good.
[352.30s -> 354.30s]  Invisible Weekly has been really going downhill.
[354.30s -> 356.30s]  It used to be about articles, but now it's just about the naked ladies.
[356.30s -> 358.47s]  I know.
[358.47s -> 360.47s]  Always the invisible naked ladies now.
[360.47s -> 364.12s]  Yeah, I know. You can't even see them. It doesn't make any sense.
[364.12s -> 366.62s]  Stand over here.
[366.62s -> 368.62s]  And I'm going to decloak and shoot this sniper in the back.
[368.62s -> 370.62s]  And we're both going to cloak at the same...
[370.62s -> 372.62s]  To make it so we're just permanently invisible.
[372.62s -> 374.92s]  So they have no idea where they're getting shot from.
[374.92s -> 376.92s]  I'm going to keep annoying people.
[376.92s -> 378.92s]  See where the pyro is right now?
[378.92s -> 380.92s]  Shoot him and then we're both invisible forever.
[380.92s -> 382.92s]  I'm going to go to the other side of the map.
[382.92s -> 384.92s]  So it's both angles.
[384.92s -> 388.95s]  I'm going to climb up this rock.
[388.95s -> 390.95s]  I'm going to shoot this soldier.
[390.95s -> 394.47s]  God damn.
[394.47s -> 396.47s]  I'm going to shoot the pyro.
[396.47s -> 399.99s]  I hit that pyro.
[399.99s -> 401.99s]  He's coming back.
[401.99s -> 404.17s]  Are you invisible?
[404.17s -> 407.56s]  He has no idea what's going on.
[407.56s -> 409.56s]  He's coming up here.
[409.56s -> 411.74s]  See the sniper?
[411.74s -> 413.74s]  He's shooting at me.
[413.74s -> 415.74s]  I shot him.
[415.74s -> 417.74s]  I'm going to shoot him.
[417.74s -> 420.42s]  You shoot him now.
[420.42s -> 422.66s]  I shot him.
[422.66s -> 424.66s]  He's going to be right back in spawn.
[424.66s -> 428.82s]  I pulled it off.
