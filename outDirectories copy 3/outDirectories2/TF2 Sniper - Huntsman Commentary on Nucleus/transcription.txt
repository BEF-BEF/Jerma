[3.45s -> 13.41s]  Hey, what is happening guys? It's Jerma here again with another gameplay commentary for Team Fortress 2.
[13.41s -> 17.91s]  This time I'm playing as the Huntsman Sniper on King of the Hill Nucleus.
[17.91s -> 22.41s]  This is not the gameplay. This is kind of the beginning. I jumped in a little late.
[22.41s -> 26.59s]  I'm gonna show you the gameplay after this. This is kind of just a few headshots and stuff like that, kind of,
[26.59s -> 31.26s]  because I didn't want a two minute gameplay, so after this is when the actual gameplay starts.
[31.26s -> 36.26s]  But I go on a pretty good run here, get a few headshots, get some good nice long shots. You know the deal.
[36.76s -> 42.26s]  Huntsman is fun. This is the Huntsman, the Vintage Jurati, and the Shahenshah.
[42.26s -> 46.44s]  And this spy, I knew he was a spy, come around the corner, I just smash him.
[46.44s -> 50.44s]  Don't know why he just was standing there, but you know, probably just caught off guard coming around the corner.
[50.44s -> 55.68s]  If you're looking for Huntsman tips and strategies and stuff like that, this is not gonna be the video for it.
[55.68s -> 62.18s]  I have a video up on my channel using the Huntsman, showing you real strategies how to use it, how to get better with it.
[62.18s -> 67.18s]  So I suggest you go, I think it was a month or so back, just go search in my channel page.
[67.18s -> 72.18s]  I believe it's called Huntsman tips and tricks. So if you're looking for that video, that's what it's called.
[72.18s -> 76.18s]  Now very, very briefly, I want to talk about my livestream schedule.
[76.18s -> 82.18s]  I know that a lot of you guys are going back to school or are already in school right now.
[82.18s -> 85.18s]  So I gotta change my livestream schedule so I don't have to be like,
[85.18s -> 90.68s]  oh, I gotta stay up till four in the morning to watch Jerma, then I have to wake up in two hours to go to school.
[90.68s -> 95.68s]  I don't want that to happen, so I'm gonna change my livestreaming to Saturdays only.
[95.68s -> 97.68s]  I'm not gonna do it two times a week anymore, guys.
[97.68s -> 103.68s]  Only Saturday nights, Saturday evenings at around six o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
[103.68s -> 107.68s]  I'm sorry if that screws up your schedule that you had when you originally were watching me,
[107.68s -> 111.98s]  but that's gonna be the way it is because I know a lot of you guys are in school,
[111.98s -> 113.98s]  so you're not gonna be able to do it on the weekdays anyways.
[113.98s -> 118.98s]  So that means that today is Saturday, so there will be a livestream tonight.
[118.98s -> 123.22s]  Check your local listings because I'm not gonna be able to tell you what time it is in Germany
[123.22s -> 126.22s]  when it ends up being six or seven o'clock Eastern Time in the United States.
[126.22s -> 128.40s]  So that's gonna happen tonight.
[128.40s -> 131.40s]  Stay alert on my Steam group because that's the only place I'm gonna ever tell you.
[131.40s -> 133.40s]  Maybe on my YouTube, but that's about it.
[133.40s -> 135.40s]  So let's start talking about the gameplay now.
[135.40s -> 138.40s]  Fresh start, three minutes, three minutes, King of the Hill Nucleus,
[138.40s -> 142.40s]  using the Huntsman, the Girardi, and the Shahansha, like I said.
[142.40s -> 145.40s]  Standing still, Demoman gets shot right in his face,
[145.40s -> 148.40s]  and looks like we're gonna cap the point. I think we get it, actually. We do.
[148.40s -> 150.40s]  This part is actually kind of funny.
[150.40s -> 153.40s]  Scout comes after me with the candy cane, and I think I'm gonna get him.
[153.40s -> 156.40s]  Oh, what's this? Another Scout coming after me and a Spy.
[156.40s -> 158.40s]  This is fantastic. Nothing bad's gonna happen here.
[158.40s -> 163.40s]  Get the kill on the Scout, but I get shot in the face by the other Scout.
[163.40s -> 165.77s]  Got our death out of the way right there.
[165.77s -> 168.77s]  That's the only time I die during this particular gameplay.
[168.77s -> 170.77s]  Let's keep going here. Roll out of the spawn.
[170.77s -> 175.77s]  I was thinking about spamming the point, but it looks like our team has it pretty well secured.
[175.77s -> 177.77s]  Heavy Engineer on the point.
[177.77s -> 179.77s]  I don't think I have to stick around here and get myself killed.
[179.77s -> 181.77s]  That's a Spy. I know it.
[181.77s -> 185.77s]  You can always tell if a Scout is a Spy, because he's running slower than a Scout.
[185.77s -> 190.07s]  And watch this! God, he just, like, breaks his neck on the wall right there.
[190.07s -> 192.07s]  I thought that was ridiculous.
[192.07s -> 194.07s]  We only have an Engineer sitting on the point right now,
[194.07s -> 196.07s]  so I figured I have to get over here at some point.
[196.07s -> 200.07s]  This Scout tracking a Scout is the most difficult thing in the world.
[200.07s -> 203.07s]  I end up getting him, though, with a nice little track shot.
[203.07s -> 205.07s]  You'll see I turn around, he's coming up the stairs,
[205.07s -> 208.38s]  and I just barely get the shot correct.
[208.38s -> 212.38s]  And there we go. Me and this Engineer got this point pretty much on lockdown.
[212.38s -> 214.38s]  Minute and 47 seconds now.
[214.38s -> 216.38s]  They still have three minutes left.
[216.38s -> 219.38s]  They haven't capped the point one time, which is huge,
[219.38s -> 221.38s]  because we're more than halfway there now.
[221.38s -> 225.38s]  Probably securing a victory, unless they can pull off something really, really crazy.
[225.38s -> 229.38s]  Coming around here just to check the perimeter, and I see a flaming Heavy.
[229.38s -> 231.38s]  Guys, your teammates really appreciate it,
[231.38s -> 235.38s]  and you get points for putting them out with a compression or a Girardi,
[235.38s -> 237.38s]  so if you don't already do this, please start doing it.
[237.38s -> 239.38s]  People really appreciate it.
[239.38s -> 241.38s]  This Spy right here comes up behind this Heavy.
[241.38s -> 243.38s]  I'm going to slow it down for you. Watch what happens.
[243.38s -> 247.38s]  He backstabs the Heavy and gets headshot at the exact same time,
[247.38s -> 250.38s]  and both of their reactions, I thought, were so funny.
[250.38s -> 253.38s]  I was dying laughing at that one.
[253.38s -> 256.62s]  So I come down here, shooting near their spawn area,
[256.62s -> 258.62s]  I get a couple of kills.
[258.62s -> 260.62s]  This is a great thing to do on Nucleus,
[260.62s -> 262.62s]  because so many people are just pouring out of this doorway.
[262.62s -> 265.62s]  It's such a small little corridor that you're pretty much guaranteed
[265.62s -> 267.62s]  to kill at least one person coming out of here.
[267.62s -> 269.62s]  Throw the Girardi.
[269.62s -> 271.62s]  Don't get anybody covered with it, but it's all right.
[271.62s -> 274.62s]  I end up making this Pyro free Willy off the edge here.
[274.62s -> 277.62s]  He falls way down to the depths.
[277.62s -> 280.62s]  So I get on the point, turn around, I see a Sniper,
[280.62s -> 283.62s]  and I know for a fact he's going to go to the little spot right there,
[283.62s -> 285.62s]  and I end up timing it right, get the kill.
[285.62s -> 287.62s]  That's what's going to happen.
[287.62s -> 289.62s]  There's a Sniper on this map.
[289.62s -> 291.62s]  They're either right in that corner,
[291.62s -> 293.62s]  or they're going to be at the top right on one of the balconies.
[293.62s -> 296.62s]  That's pretty much every single Sniper spot.
[296.62s -> 299.62s]  Get another kill for a Soldier that was coming for the point,
[299.62s -> 301.62s]  and I get another kill on a Pyro coming for the point.
[301.62s -> 303.62s]  So now there's less than 30 seconds.
[303.62s -> 305.62s]  Everybody's here.
[305.62s -> 307.80s]  The whole family is here on the point just hanging out.
[307.80s -> 309.80s]  Dead Ringer Spy activates his cloak,
[309.80s -> 311.80s]  but he's not going to be able to do a whole lot,
[311.80s -> 313.80s]  because there's so many people squashed on the point.
[313.80s -> 315.80s]  He's going to have to bury his way into people,
[315.80s -> 317.80s]  and he probably will end up just falling off the edge,
[317.80s -> 320.17s]  so I'm not concerned about that.
[320.17s -> 322.17s]  So slowly we are all creeping up to their spawn door
[322.17s -> 324.17s]  with less than 10 seconds now,
[324.17s -> 326.17s]  less than 5 seconds.
[326.17s -> 328.17s]  The game is over with a flawless victory.
[328.17s -> 330.17s]  Thanks everybody so much for watching.
[330.17s -> 332.17s]  I really appreciate it.
[332.17s -> 334.17s]  Hopefully you show up tonight to the livestream.
[334.17s -> 336.17s]  If you don't, that's cool too.
[336.17s -> 338.17s]  I'm glad you watch the videos on YouTube wherever you watch them.
[338.17s -> 340.17s]  Thank you so much.
[340.17s -> 342.17s]  Take care everybody. I'll see you all next time.
