[3.96s -> 14.68s]  Oh, no, that was a shpee. He just jumped out to try to stab me in the face.
[17.02s -> 28.49s]  Get out of town. Arc those bullets. Yeah
[29.97s -> 38.13s]  Right click is sandwich. All right, these guys put the sentry on top of the point. Oh
[39.26s -> 46.67s]  Get it. There we go. We got one more point to cap. Sentry, sentry, sentry, sentry. Look out, look out, look out
[46.67s -> 52.30s]  There's the sentry. God, it's so hard to arc these bullets. I'm almost dead
[52.30s -> 57.82s]  Look, what if I just sit here and spam over there? Oh, they disappear. There's actual range on these. Good to know
[61.17s -> 63.60s]  Please
[63.68s -> 65.68s]  Kill him, kill him
[68.64s -> 70.64s]  No
[70.96s -> 82.54s]  What? The pyro looks like a skeleton. Look at this like scream mask he has on. He looks like an anteater scream mask
[82.54s -> 85.29s]  What the fuck is that?
[85.69s -> 88.09s]  Let's go air blast some motherfuckers right now
[93.01s -> 100.85s]  Come on get in range. Air blast. Fuck. I don't have enough ammo. God damn it.
[103.28s -> 109.53s]  I gotta get a couple of kills with the pyro. I mean, come on. There it is. Oh, let me get that last hit
[111.73s -> 116.20s]  What the hell was that medic doing? Medic, that was not a safe choice
[117.00s -> 125.02s]  Capped this last point. You want to go Engie? I should probably stay on that. Oh spy. I got the spy
[125.50s -> 131.32s]  Don't let him build that sentry. Nice job. Nice job. You have no health
[131.68s -> 135.67s]  Let's hope you don't get destroyed. We're gonna win. I saw that spy. Yeah
[136.75s -> 142.48s]  Get burnt. There we go. Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[142.84s -> 151.07s]  Let's go scout. What are these like generators? Double jump. Cool. Cool. I love this jump noise
[151.07s -> 154.42s]  I kind of want this in regular TF2
[154.50s -> 158.85s]  I'm gonna like figure out how to like mod that and like put that in as like a jump file
[161.26s -> 163.34s]  Too many people on red
[163.38s -> 172.16s]  Too many red people. Too many red team. Too many red team. Gotta play it like you actually play scout
[174.10s -> 187.85s]  Are there any unlockables in this game? Gotta try hard. Hold on. Oh, I gotta double try hard. Oh, he blew himself up
[189.29s -> 195.68s]  Fucking god, that's the second time that's happened. This guy with his like direct hit bullshit
[195.68s -> 203.19s]  Oh, Jarvis getting a little mad here. Calm down. It's okay. It's just gang garrison. Is this the guy? This is the guy
[203.31s -> 209.82s]  How many shots does it take to you get to the center of a goddamn soldier? That's what I want to know
[212.53s -> 219.46s]  I got him at least I got him. That's all I care about all I care about is I killed that guy now make it to
[219.46s -> 226.72s]  Their generator room just run by everybody. You're the scout. Jerma. Come on. Let's go here. There it is generator
[226.88s -> 228.88s]  There's a got up. They got a century in here
[229.84s -> 237.56s]  David this guy's trying what?
[239.82s -> 245.00s]  What I killed a spy how the hell did that happen?
[245.64s -> 252.22s]  All right, I want to get this guy. This guy is just causing me all kinds of trouble
[252.90s -> 265.52s]  Yeah, let's go. Why is the engineer? There it is. This thing is almost dead. We're gonna lose
[265.76s -> 270.09s]  We're going to lose right now. I can't even get in that room
[270.09s -> 274.04s]  We need like somebody to take out that century. I hear the two soldiers again
[274.04s -> 280.03s]  Oh, bye and there's a century in here still in here. Yeah, it is. I'm so dead. Goodbye
[280.37s -> 284.69s]  Go down to like the sewers. Yeah bait him. That's what you want. Do you want to bait him? You want to bait him?
[284.73s -> 293.76s]  Get baited. Yeah, this guy knows I have like no HP. Come on shoot me
[298.23s -> 301.11s]  What a pain in the ass I am
[301.15s -> 305.08s]  No, damn, I would have probably would have killed him
[305.60s -> 314.63s]  Something tells me it's gonna be really really friggin difficult to place by because it's only on a 2d plane
[314.63s -> 321.05s]  Somebody's just gonna spam over here and like I did earlier and just kill me. There's no disguise. I don't think I'm just cloaked
[321.25s -> 330.04s]  Looks like the cloak is infinite though. So that's good. That's good. What is that friendly fire? No way
[330.04s -> 341.04s]  It's gonna get behind enemy lines and wait for some sorry sucker to come over here. What is that? The cave story guy?
[344.72s -> 350.16s]  All right, the 10th class you heard it here folks is the 10th class is confirmed the cave story guy
[354.14s -> 360.17s]  Okay, okay. Okay. Here we go. Gonna get the backstab right here. Oh my god
[361.36s -> 363.60s]  That's so slow. Oh
[364.60s -> 366.60s]  I did it
[367.60s -> 374.21s]  Big step. All right. I got him big step
[380.48s -> 386.57s]  I actually got both of them makes them shit. I
[387.67s -> 391.75s]  Can't believe I actually
[391.75s -> 393.47s]  know get him I
[393.47s -> 401.60s]  Kind of like spy spy is a lot of fun. Let's follow this. Let's follow this asshole up here
[401.64s -> 408.90s]  How does he know I'm here didn't bump into me? How does this guy know I'm here? There's no way he knows
[408.90s -> 416.61s]  I'm cloaked right now. What a bastard. I can't even make this jump. Anyways, all right, he's gonna come back up here
[416.61s -> 430.96s]  Here's another scout get over here screw it. We're going this way. It's bubble gun bullshit. What the hell you can't what?
[430.96s -> 440.50s]  How am I supposed to combat this? It's just a but it's cool. They have like these D made maps. That's very interesting
[440.86s -> 448.77s]  Very interesting. I'm going down below. Forget this. I'm gonna come up from the pine
[449.29s -> 453.75s]  Or we can just spawn camp them that will that'll work, too
[453.91s -> 461.58s]  This guy is legitimately just firing into the spawn waiting for someone to appear. Oh my god, this is awful
[465.59s -> 467.59s]  Spawn camp city come on now
[468.15s -> 472.51s]  Who am I to say that? I'm probably gonna just jump down and try to backstab someone
[472.83s -> 479.43s]  Well, we got striking similarities between TF2 and gang garrison. The spawn camping is in both games
[480.45s -> 482.01s]  striking similarities
[482.01s -> 484.51s]  You gotta be kidding me
