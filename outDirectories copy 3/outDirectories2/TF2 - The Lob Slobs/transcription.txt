[0.31s -> 9.95s]  Do you trade carnival?
[9.95s -> 13.51s]  Do you trade carnival? It's my favorite map.
[13.51s -> 15.51s]  You can just turn on the weird, don't you?
[15.51s -> 22.46s]  No, I have to be in the mood, don't you know? I have to be in the mood to make videos. Do you understand that?
[22.46s -> 27.41s]  I have to be in the mood. For you.
[27.41s -> 29.41s]  Hey, did you see that top comment?
[29.41s -> 33.41s]  German wants to be in the mood for starting well.
[33.41s -> 41.17s]  Look at all these snipers, dude. Oh, baby. This is how we do a little bit of shlob.
[41.17s -> 45.18s]  Wow, did you just kill a sniper who was standing still?
[45.18s -> 47.67s]  Shut the fuck up. I didn't see you kill him.
[47.67s -> 50.23s]  Yeah, because I wasn't in the game.
[50.23s -> 57.23s]  Look, I don't need to take advice from you, okay? You give terrible advice. Your advice is for the fucking birds, okay?
[57.23s -> 59.73s]  What do you mean my advice is for the birds?
[59.73s -> 65.73s]  If I was a bird, I would take advice from you. That's what I'm saying.
[65.73s -> 69.73s]  What kind of advice do you give to a bird, is what I'm saying.
[69.73s -> 75.73s]  I've never heard birds in your background before, and you just got all these birds going...
[75.73s -> 78.73s]  I've got this window open.
[78.73s -> 82.73s]  Do you want some advice for the birds? Shut your fucking window.
[82.73s -> 87.85s]  The plan is to be lob shlobs inside of their vent.
[87.85s -> 89.85s]  Do you know what that means?
[89.85s -> 91.85s]  I don't know what that means. No one knows what that means.
[91.85s -> 94.85s]  Don't get headshot.
[94.85s -> 95.85s]  Yeah, I don't know how to do that.
[95.85s -> 97.85s]  So stand right here.
[97.85s -> 98.85s]  Right here?
[98.85s -> 99.85s]  Right here.
[99.85s -> 100.85s]  Okay.
[100.85s -> 104.85s]  Oh my god, you have the worst plan.
[104.85s -> 110.50s]  There's no way they could get behind us, because we're blocking off the only entrance.
[110.50s -> 111.50s]  Yeah, we're blocking the entrance.
[111.50s -> 117.87s]  Where a lot of people are actively playing the game.
[117.87s -> 119.87s]  Welcome to the lob shlob den.
[119.87s -> 122.18s]  I can just...
[122.18s -> 127.50s]  You know that spy. That spy is going to come around for sure.
[127.50s -> 132.50s]  But there is something to be said, though. Whoever comes down this hall...
[132.50s -> 133.50s]  You're supposed to be...
[133.50s -> 135.50s]  I almost died because you didn't follow the technique.
[135.50s -> 138.13s]  Well, let's go get you a health kit.
[138.13s -> 139.13s]  Oh my god.
[139.13s -> 141.50s]  You better get him.
[141.50s -> 143.50s]  He's got a lock and load. He's not lob shlobbing like you.
[143.50s -> 147.83s]  Nice.
[147.83s -> 149.83s]  Have you heard of any good movies that came out recently?
[149.83s -> 154.49s]  Look at this. Look behind you.
[154.49s -> 159.49s]  We have an entire brigade of people just sitting in this vent.
[159.49s -> 162.49s]  Oh, before it was me and you, it was a duo, but now it's a brigade.
[162.49s -> 164.49s]  We had two people with brigade status.
[164.49s -> 165.49s]  Look at this.
[165.49s -> 168.30s]  Are we for real right now?
[168.30s -> 175.54s]  We got the one guy on red just sitting back there.
[175.54s -> 178.86s]  So what I'm going to do... You know what? I'm going to better...
[178.86s -> 180.86s]  I'm just going to go spectate after.
[180.86s -> 182.86s]  We're going to do this once or twice, and then I'm going to spectate.
[182.86s -> 184.86s]  Hey, quit headshotting people.
[184.86s -> 187.86s]  Hey. Hey, stop it.
[187.86s -> 191.36s]  This guy's just getting like free kills.
[191.36s -> 196.16s]  All right, so ready. Everyone on red, stuff back here.
[196.16s -> 199.16s]  We all have to be stuffed in the corner.
[199.16s -> 204.13s]  This is not going to happen, man.
[204.13s -> 205.13s]  All right, you guys ready?
[205.13s -> 209.14s]  Everyone with the default grenade launcher on the count of three.
[209.14s -> 212.14s]  On the count of three, start lobbing.
[212.14s -> 221.82s]  One, two, three.
[221.82s -> 222.82s]  Hold on, hold on.
[222.82s -> 223.82s]  Yeah, there we go.
[223.82s -> 224.82s]  There we go. There we go.
[224.82s -> 225.82s]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[225.82s -> 227.44s]  You ready?
[227.44s -> 231.44s]  So in three seconds, I'm going to count down, start doing the lob-slob.
[231.44s -> 233.94s]  You guys ready?
[233.94s -> 236.61s]  Three, two, one.
[236.61s -> 244.07s]  Go for it.
[244.07s -> 247.38s]  It's like two people just kind of came in afterwards.
[247.38s -> 249.62s]  Whoever holds this wins.
[249.62s -> 250.62s]  I'm going to do my own timer.
[250.62s -> 254.62s]  Whoever holds this, whoever has the most people in here on red team or blue team wins.
[254.62s -> 259.84s]  And you can only use the grenade launcher.
[259.84s -> 264.84s]  This is like, this is just, this is ridiculous.
[264.84s -> 268.84s]  Nobody can even do anything.
[268.84s -> 274.34s]  You might as well just stand at the very back and just lob into the side.
[274.34s -> 277.58s]  This one guy.
[277.58s -> 280.58s]  I wish you guys could see what this looks like.
[280.58s -> 283.58s]  This is just not even cool.
[283.58s -> 288.46s]  This is just so stupid.
[288.46s -> 293.83s]  Okay, let's all be spies.
[293.83s -> 296.83s]  Yeah, who brings a pyro to a bar fight, to a knife fight?
[296.83s -> 303.22s]  Come on, man.
[303.22s -> 306.22s]  Yeah, he wants to kick, he wants to get kicked.
[306.22s -> 307.22s]  He said he wants to get kicked.
[307.22s -> 309.22s]  I'm not going to do it.
[309.22s -> 311.22s]  I'm not going to.
[311.22s -> 314.35s]  Nice.
[314.35s -> 318.19s]  Three, two, one.
[318.19s -> 325.19s]  Knife fight.
[325.19s -> 328.58s]  This is going to last forever.
[328.58s -> 332.10s]  Why has nobody died?
[332.10s -> 338.67s]  Oh, I got taunt killed.
[338.67s -> 344.43s]  Did anybody on blue die?
[344.43s -> 346.43s]  Did you see that taunt kill?
[346.43s -> 349.44s]  Did you see that taunt kill?
[349.44s -> 351.44s]  I'm really surprised this actually really works.
[351.44s -> 352.44s]  Okay, you guys ready?
[352.44s -> 353.44s]  Here I am.
[353.44s -> 355.13s]  I'm going to go for it.
[355.13s -> 357.13s]  Let's see how many people, if I can get you guys.
[357.13s -> 361.65s]  Oh my God.
[361.65s -> 368.18s]  I can't believe that that works.
[368.18s -> 369.54s]  Wow.
[369.54s -> 373.94s]  That's, I got at least five or six people.
[373.94s -> 379.27s]  Yeah, that's so cool.
[379.27s -> 381.27s]  I'm just farming my strange.
[381.27s -> 382.27s]  Sorry, guys.
