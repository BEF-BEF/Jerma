[1.85s -> 8.41s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight
[8.41s -> 15.11s]  gonna be playing as the... So what I want to talk about today guys is a few things and uh
[16.17s -> 20.09s]  some things are really bad in this video some of the things we're gonna talk about are not cool
[20.65s -> 25.29s]  but you gotta deal with it you have to deal with these problems if you are going to have a computer
[25.29s -> 29.45s]  that is custom built that's just it's just things like this are going to happen so
[29.53s -> 33.29s]  let's start from the very beginning here you probably watched the video from like two or three
[33.29s -> 37.61s]  weeks ago where I was like building a supercomputer going to the micro center gonna get a bunch of
[37.61s -> 44.82s]  parts it's gonna be so sick and I did that and I had it built and the thing like shit the bed
[44.82s -> 49.22s]  last night like that I had a motherboard problem last night I don't know what's going on I think
[49.22s -> 53.70s]  the motherboard might be bad it might be a crappy I don't know I don't know all I know is that it
[53.70s -> 60.58s]  doesn't work and I'm currently recording this on my laptop so if this video is not 1080p I
[60.58s -> 65.38s]  sincerely apologize I'm gonna try to do it so it really could be 1080p it might not it might not
[65.38s -> 70.66s]  but it might be now if you've been following this whole me showing pictures of it me talking about
[70.66s -> 74.90s]  it then you you'll know that when you get when you run into a problem like this with a computer
[74.90s -> 78.02s]  when you have an issue if you custom build a computer if you have somebody build it for you
[78.02s -> 83.40s]  whatever whatever if you have a custom built pc when you run into a problem like this you want to
[83.40s -> 88.36s]  just pick the thing up and like spike it through a fucking window like that last night when this
[88.36s -> 93.00s]  was happening and it was like 12 hours were going by I was having so many problems I was trying to
[93.00s -> 96.92s]  figure out what the hell was going on doing everything I could possibly think of and nothing
[96.92s -> 100.92s]  was working I couldn't get anything to really work the way I wanted it to and it was just a
[100.92s -> 107.40s]  nightmare and if this thing had a tail if this computer had a tail I would have grabbed it spun
[107.40s -> 113.32s]  around a bunch of times and just let go and shut up into whatever it was gonna fucking run into
[113.32s -> 119.50s]  it was that close good thing I didn't install a tail on this pc and actually I just thought of
[119.50s -> 123.61s]  something what if you took what if you took a computer bear with me for a second what if
[123.61s -> 128.95s]  you took a computer and you put a little tail on it and then you gave it ears on the front
[128.95s -> 134.12s]  and put whiskers on the front too so it was like a giant like mouse that would be pretty funny
[134.12s -> 138.52s]  wouldn't it or am I this is just totally just inaccurate but that probably wouldn't be funny
[138.52s -> 143.54s]  at all all right forget it but the computer is currently being fixed it's going to be fine in
[143.54s -> 148.18s]  probably a day or so I just haven't really been able to do very much this last couple of days
[148.18s -> 152.82s]  which sucks because I got a whole lot of stuff going on there's a whole lot of videos I'm making
[152.82s -> 157.86s]  in the process of I was in the process of making them before the video dumped to the bed like
[157.86s -> 162.34s]  dumped its pants and shit its diaper in the bed like I there are at least a few videos and thank
[162.34s -> 168.01s]  god that I backed up all this stuff if you guys have never seen my video on backing up your hard
[168.01s -> 172.63s]  drive then go watch it well you don't really even have to go watch it just back up your hard drives
[172.63s -> 178.55s]  with information you don't want to lose because if I had lost a bunch of this stuff for videos
[178.55s -> 185.38s]  that I'm currently working on right now like I don't even know I can't even imagine my
[185.38s -> 192.26s]  infuriation if that would were to happen anyways we're gonna move on we're gonna talk about the
[192.26s -> 196.26s]  second thing I wanted to bring up in this video which is a little better and a little nicer and
[196.26s -> 201.54s]  a little more uplifting than the previous few minutes or a couple minutes and that's the tf2
[201.54s -> 206.82s]  mix-up tf2 mix-up number six I got to be a part of this year so it was really really cool really
[206.82s -> 211.22s]  awesome if you don't know what the tf2 mix-up is they get a bunch of youtubers and some gaming
[211.22s -> 215.86s]  developers a couple people from valve end up showing up and we play matches against each other
[215.86s -> 219.94s]  and it's all recorded it's all captured and it's all for charity so I was able to be a part of it
[219.94s -> 225.46s]  this year I was actually on captain sparkles team a link will be in the description if you want to
[225.46s -> 230.66s]  watch the videos that were recorded during this segment of time we were playing for the mix-up
[230.66s -> 234.58s]  there's going to be I think three or four different rounds that sparkles is going to
[234.58s -> 240.98s]  be uploading so if you want to check if you want to check out the perspective from our end our team
[240.98s -> 244.42s]  go to sparkles channel go to that video that's going to be in the description there'll be a
[244.42s -> 249.14s]  link there you can't miss it you're going to take a right on second street if you see the mcdonald's
[249.14s -> 252.90s]  you went too far and then take a left at those lights and you're going to be a captain sparkles
[252.90s -> 256.66s]  channel so that's where you want to go if you want to see that and we're going to move on to
[256.66s -> 263.26s]  talk about something else in this video is the fact that holiday crates are dropping now
[263.26s -> 266.86s]  holiday crates are dropping all over the place I just got some I don't even I might even have
[266.86s -> 270.86s]  gotten one in this video I don't even know if I show the death or not and I think they've been
[270.86s -> 275.74s]  dropping for a little over a week I think December 6th is when they were added so like a week and a
[275.74s -> 282.06s]  few days since they have been dropping but what this means the initial hypothesis that we are
[282.06s -> 287.82s]  going to be getting three updates in three months is actually potentially going to come true so we
[287.82s -> 293.58s]  are probably going to see the holiday christmas miss miss whatever you want to call it tf2 update
[293.58s -> 299.34s]  fairly soon here and everybody can cross their fingers and hope that we get some pretty cool
[299.34s -> 305.51s]  stuff because there really has never been a holiday themed tf2 update that didn't give us
[305.51s -> 311.19s]  something cool they've always introduced at least a couple of new weapons at least a couple of new
[311.19s -> 315.91s]  maps or new modes they have there but they've always released something cool for the christmas
[315.91s -> 322.87s]  and holiday season so here's hoping that these holiday crates coming around is a sign that the
[322.87s -> 328.66s]  update is sort of looming and with that that is going to wrap up the video thank you all so much
[328.66s -> 334.90s]  for watching I really do appreciate it stay tuned for the holiday animation video that I was talking
[334.90s -> 340.34s]  about that should be ready to roll here in the next week or so I think I touched upon this
[340.90s -> 344.82s]  once but I'll reiterate it one more time there's going to be an animation on the channel it's going
[344.82s -> 349.70s]  to be a grandpa video it's going to be grandpa animated that's all I'm going to say I'm not going
[349.70s -> 354.10s]  to say anything more about it you'll just see it in your sub box when you see it a lot of time has
[354.10s -> 359.30s]  gone into this the animator has been spending a ton of his time putting it together and I hope you
[359.30s -> 363.30s]  guys enjoy it you'll see it when you see it so that's it everybody thanks for watching everybody
[363.30s -> 372.46s]  just appreciate it and I'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody I did I
[372.46s -> 377.58s]  just did that because um I don't have any like the files the sound files or the photoshop files
[377.58s -> 381.67s]  they're probably not even a thumbnail on this video either and you know I because I don't have
[381.67s -> 384.31s]  the files okay well bye
