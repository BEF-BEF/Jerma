[0.18s -> 4.50s]  Open up, please. I'm gonna have to lower the volume on it, too, because it is pretty loud.
[10.52s -> 19.18s]  Oh, I'm already getting the chills. And Abracadabra, can you see it? I hope so.
[19.18s -> 29.70s]  I think you can. Oh, I gotta get the chat up here. I cannot hit escape, though. That's one,
[29.70s -> 43.74s]  the one big thing. Cannot hit escape. So I can see what you guys are saying. There's that.
[48.89s -> 57.13s]  Oh no, the chat just can't fit anywhere. Hold on, can I move this? I can. Excellent. Here we are.
[58.66s -> 76.98s]  One more second, guys. This here. Perfect. Perfect. Now I can see what everybody's saying.
[76.98s -> 89.13s]  Time to play Slender. Oh boy, oh boy. So the goal here tonight, guys, is I'm gonna try
[90.14s -> 94.82s]  and get all the pages. I'm gonna try and beat this game. I'm gonna do it.
[101.32s -> 110.49s]  Let's go! Gonna beat Slender. I'm gonna beat Slender. Definitely not gonna beat Slender,
[111.05s -> 116.01s]  because it is like impossible to beat. Because once you get like seven pages,
[116.01s -> 124.34s]  he just eats your soul. All right, here comes page one, guys. Welcome to the Scare Stream.
[124.34s -> 131.46s]  Happy preliminary Halloween. Let's do... Oh, wait. Hold on. Oh, that just ruined my whole entrance.
[131.46s -> 140.36s]  I hit E, not click. Here we go. I only have the headphone in one ear. I know. You can call me
[140.36s -> 151.53s]  whatever you want to call me. I thought I just saw him. I thought I just saw him. I'm gonna try
[151.53s -> 155.13s]  to upload this to YouTube, so if you are gonna miss some of this, I'm gonna try and get the whole
[155.13s -> 161.72s]  thing up there. If you're watching this on YouTube, hey, what's up? How you doing? Did I just walk in
[161.72s -> 172.87s]  like a circle? All right, let's see. I'm not looking behind me. Everyone's like, oh, behind you,
[172.87s -> 187.34s]  behind you. I ain't looking behind me. I need to go left. Whoa, I hear static. Where is he? I hear
[187.34s -> 192.89s]  static right now. Where the hell is he? I hear static right now. Where is he? He's probably right
[192.89s -> 201.99s]  there. What? Where is he? I don't even know where he is. I don't know where the hell he is. Where is
[201.99s -> 213.22s]  he? Oh, my God. Where is he? He's probably like right... If I... Ready? He's right there. He's right
[213.22s -> 217.78s]  there. He's right there. Run to the tree. Run to the tree. Run to the tree. Run to the tree. The tree
[217.78s -> 225.51s]  of life. Don't look for him. You have... But that's the thing. You have to look for him. You have to
[225.51s -> 233.27s]  like turn and look. Hello, page two. He's... As long as I know where he is, he's fine. He's right behind
[233.27s -> 240.84s]  me. He's right up my ass. I'll tell you a thing or two, slender man. You want to mess with me?
[241.72s -> 248.55s]  I'll give you the one, two... Why am I taking my hands off? I'm like... Oh, let me make like a joke
[248.55s -> 259.40s]  and die. That's a great idea, Jeremiah. Is there anything on here? Can I like go in there and go
[259.40s -> 264.86s]  to the bathroom? I thought he was like right there. Come on, get three. Go. He's still behind me. I
[264.86s -> 278.18s]  know exactly where he is. I wish I could run. Damn. I wish I could sprint. I can sprint now.
[278.18s -> 290.41s]  I love reading the chat. It's so fun. I can't believe I said I was going to beat this game.
[290.41s -> 305.03s]  There's no way I'm going to beat this game. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Did I just walk in
[305.03s -> 313.21s]  a giant circle? No, there's... I can't even see. Yeah, that's the next part. I got to go there.
[313.21s -> 318.95s]  You needed something to fall asleep to. Larry, I'm sorry. This is what you have to fall asleep to.
[318.95s -> 332.07s]  It would be tough if I was you. Slender and SCP containment breach. See, it's good having you guys
[332.07s -> 336.95s]  here in the chat because when I play this game alone, whenever I play like scary games alone,
[338.58s -> 344.39s]  there's not a whole lot... It's so terrifying. I can't... I'm much better looking over and seeing
[344.39s -> 351.58s]  all you guys in the chat. It makes it so much better because now I won't crap my pants,
[351.58s -> 357.13s]  except I already did in the first 30 seconds of this game starting. I'm scared right now.
[358.01s -> 384.55s]  My teeth are chattering. There was no indication that that was going to happen.
[384.55s -> 400.26s]  One down. It's like only three more games to play. Oh, man. That hurt my whole body. I thought it
[400.26s -> 412.47s]  was supposed to play static whenever it gets close to you. Jeez. All right. We're going to do this
[412.47s -> 427.48s]  again. Let me load it up again. We're doing Slender again. Yes, of course I want to run it.
[433.16s -> 440.54s]  Honestly, like that, I really did not think that he was there. I really did not think he was there.
[440.54s -> 449.58s]  How does that look? No, I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go to here. Okay, looks fine.
[449.58s -> 463.86s]  Not big surprise. All right, looks good. Let's go. Drag you over here. See, the bad part about
[463.86s -> 469.70s]  these SCP and Slender and stuff, if you try to hit escape or get to a menu or something,
[469.70s -> 476.09s]  you just close the game. So you have to be a little weird with it. Try to keep it on the
[476.09s -> 483.21s]  side and drag the chat over. Hey, do I want a hug? Yeah, I do. Especially after that. All right,
[483.21s -> 487.45s]  what'd I get? Three pages? Four pages? Yeah, that was great. Great job, Jeremy. You did a great job
[487.45s -> 500.81s]  there. All right, I got to get ready for this one. Last time I was stupid and I turned around
[500.81s -> 511.24s]  and looked at him and said, hello, page one. All right, I got to think of a plan of action here
[511.24s -> 518.78s]  before I pick this up. Where's the page? What the hell? Okay, there's the page one. I'm going
[518.78s -> 525.42s]  to go straight through here. No, wait, do I want to go there? Or straight down there? Let's see.
[525.42s -> 534.98s]  I'm going to go straight down there. Here we go. Ready? Go. You can't run. You can't hide. You
[534.98s -> 543.91s]  can't get away from the Shenderman. Do I already hear static? I think I already hear still. No,
[543.91s -> 547.27s]  I don't. Oh, great. Good thing I decided to run into a fence. Now I'm going to turn around. He's
[547.27s -> 568.33s]  going to be right there. Cool. Great. I shouldn't have ran. That was a dumb idea. I should have
[568.33s -> 574.44s]  sprinted. Oh, you know what I wish? I wish there was a stamina bar. Somebody said the
[574.44s -> 578.60s]  stamina is like, it's hard to read. I wish there was a bar right there, like right on the screen
[578.60s -> 583.66s]  that said, oh, you have like this percentage or this amount. I just walked in a circle.
[593.67s -> 600.78s]  Man, I hate this. I hate this guy. Where's like the gun so I can turn around and just
[600.78s -> 609.19s]  just unload on his and touch static or is that water? I don't think there's water in this game.
[609.19s -> 616.54s]  Oh, is that water or static? There's no water. I'm not looking behind me. I'm not making that
[616.54s -> 625.99s]  same mistake. See, last time I looked behind me, that was a massive mistake. What are you guys
[625.99s -> 632.92s]  saying? Let's see. Strafe jump. You can jump in this game. I don't think you could jump. I thought
[632.92s -> 638.26s]  that was him right there, by the way, like whatever the hell that is. Oh, we have some moss on the
[638.26s -> 647.82s]  tree that's painted just like Slenderman's body. No, I'm not looking behind me. Don't ever look
[647.82s -> 660.33s]  behind you. Worst idea. You know, it's people that talk about the spy and Slenderman. Think about it.
[660.33s -> 664.92s]  He's in a suit. He has like no face. He's got like a mask on or whatever. I don't know. Maybe
[664.92s -> 673.85s]  doesn't have a mask on, but tall guy in a suit that gets behind you. Slenderman is a spy. What?
[673.85s -> 683.46s]  I hate being in here. Get. Oh, hi. Fantastic. How you doing, man? Good to meet you. Get me
[683.46s -> 688.66s]  out of this hellhole of a bathroom. I don't even care. Screw that frigging paper. I don't even
[688.66s -> 693.48s]  care. I'll lose the game. I don't even, I don't even want to be in there. If I get stuck in there
[693.48s -> 703.21s]  with him, I, I'm dead. It's over. I'm dead. I'm so dead right now. I'm going to back up right into
[703.21s -> 706.68s]  him and it's going to scare me. I'm not going to get scared. I'm not going to get scared this time.
[706.68s -> 725.53s]  I'm going to look him right in his eyes. Run. I'm going to get, I'm going to spit that out.
[725.53s -> 728.73s]  I was, if he jumped at me right there, I would have spit that all over my screen and the stream
[728.73s -> 742.39s]  would have had to like end. Getting stuck on trees now. That's not cool. Probably right behind me.
[742.39s -> 753.54s]  It's going to make that noise. Move faster. You piece of. Oh, there's so many things I could say
[753.54s -> 762.42s]  right now. I don't even know what adjective to use. What's, what's somebody say? Jerma is Slenderman.
[762.42s -> 767.74s]  I don't know. I don't even know what that said. I'm too scared. There's another one right here.
[769.05s -> 777.42s]  He's probably this asshole is probably going to be standing right here. I wish I could just take
[777.42s -> 785.37s]  my headphone out and not have to hear this music. I'm going to have to turn around. Yeah. I got to
[785.37s -> 805.34s]  turn around. Great. Is that him? No, it's not. Go. I'm going to, I can't look. I seriously can't
[805.34s -> 818.14s]  look at the screen. He's, he's like to the left of me. He's like right there. And I, I need to go
[818.14s -> 840.62s]  that way. This is the worst, especially because I can't run anymore. This is it for Slender. I
[840.62s -> 847.11s]  can't take Slender anymore. It's, it's, I can't take it anymore. He's, he's, when he's going to,
[847.11s -> 857.86s]  you know what, you ready for this guys? I'm going to run right at him. Wait, no, no, no. Opening,
[857.86s -> 862.55s]  opening. Make sure, you know, we're going to just, we're going to check. We're going to do a quick
[862.55s -> 869.77s]  check. Hey, where are you? You're right behind me. Yep. He's right behind me. You know, now I'm not
[869.77s -> 875.51s]  so scared because I know the son of a bitch is right behind me and he's a slow slug. He ain't
[875.51s -> 888.73s]  catching up to me. Good luck catching up to me. I got legs. I can run. He has legs too. What's
[888.73s -> 900.95s]  that? Okay. Definitely still right behind me. I'm going to grab it. Oh my God. I can feel him
[900.95s -> 910.98s]  behind me. Is there a note there? I don't even care. I can't even turn to look and see if there's
[910.98s -> 927.96s]  a note. I think there is. What if I do this? No, I just got to keep moving. Oh, there's another
[927.96s -> 950.15s]  note. I see it. Is that a note? It is. Okay, good. Grab the note. Grab the note. Hey, can't run. Yeah,
[950.15s -> 953.27s]  I wish I had more stamina. Oh, is that him? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[953.27s -> 968.52s]  know. I don't know. Who knows? I don't know, man. Did I already get the one on the tree? I don't
[968.52s -> 983.02s]  remember. I don't know if I got the one on the tree. I don't think I did. Go. I don't want to
[983.02s -> 997.74s]  turn around to grab this. Got it. Hello. It's going to do it. He's right here. He's right here. I
[998.70s -> 1009.54s]  knew it. See? I told you. I knew it. I knew it. I could feel him. I could feel him like right
[1009.54s -> 1019.34s]  up my... He was grabbing onto my butt cheeks and squeezing them. That's like how much I felt him.
[1019.34s -> 1032.23s]  Slender Man. I'll punch Slender Man in his Slender face. I'll knock his teeth out. All right. I
[1033.42s -> 1040.01s]  can't play Slender Man anymore. I can't play you anymore. I got to move on to Containment Breach.
[1041.59s -> 1056.76s]  We'll play Containment Breach. Actually, Containment Breach is probably worse than Slender.
[1056.76s -> 1072.28s]  Containment Breach. All right. This game is loud as hell. Memory access violation. What the hell
[1072.28s -> 1089.85s]  does that mean? Memory access violation. I'll give you a violation. I'll like park my car at
[1089.85s -> 1095.03s]  double parking after seven o'clock and I'll get a violation. I'll show you. That was a bad joke.
[1095.03s -> 1106.15s]  I apologize for that one. All right. Looks like we're playing SCP-087-B. It's next up on the list.
[1106.15s -> 1117.42s]  Next up on the list. Let's do it. Here we go. Oh, wow. This is loud. This is loud. Got to turn you
[1117.42s -> 1127.83s]  down. Oh, God. Ow, my head. Wow. That's loud. You are loud as hell. Wow. Sorry about that.
[1128.55s -> 1151.51s]  That was bad. That was loud. Hey, hold on a second. That was weird. That was weird.
[1151.51s -> 1157.11s]  Hold on. Yeah. I'm going to turn it down the window. Was that loud for all you guys too?
[1157.11s -> 1169.02s]  That was like, I felt like somebody shot me in the side of the head. Okay. I can turn it down
[1169.02s -> 1176.92s]  from here. All right. Let's do this again. In fact, hell no. I'm going to turn this all the way down.
[1186.63s -> 1203.51s]  Can I open that up? Open up. All right. Oh, can I, I gotta, no, no. Why am I stuck again? What in the
[1203.51s -> 1218.39s]  name of God? It keeps on locking up my mouse and I can't change anything. Let's see if I can catch
[1218.39s -> 1225.62s]  it quick. Yeah. I gotta, I gotta hit the, I gotta make direct show go through. I know it's a black
[1225.62s -> 1241.58s]  screen. I'm sorry. Let's try this again. I gotta catch it right when it pops up. So I need this open
[1241.58s -> 1252.31s]  and come here. You come here, come here, come here, come here. Oh, I had it. Oh, move over here so I
[1252.31s -> 1266.12s]  can catch you quicker. Got it. No, now it's at zero. Damn it. I'll get it. I'll get it. There we go.
[1266.12s -> 1285.02s]  Okay. Bingo. Bingo. Please proceed with caution. All right. Here we go. Oh, wait, seven B. B is for
[1285.02s -> 1301.98s]  ball. You know the rest. Going down the stairs. So this is like a hallway simulator and stuff jumps
[1301.98s -> 1317.96s]  out at you and scares you and it's horrible. I get, we got three. I don't want to go down there.
[1317.96s -> 1334.18s]  Screw that. Screw that. Oh, eight, seven B. You are now entering. Whoa. Hello. What the hell was that?
[1334.18s -> 1339.38s]  It's been a long time since I played. Oh, eight, seven B. So I forget whatever. I forget what
[1339.38s -> 1363.66s]  happens. It's been a while. Can I, can I just say that we, we, we live in the 21st century.
[1364.54s -> 1371.30s]  How can you have a radio that sucks that bad? I mean, really, seriously, where did you get that
[1371.30s -> 1376.58s]  radio? Dude, your radio sucks big time. You might want to replace the batteries. Why is everything
[1376.58s -> 1381.96s]  getting all weird looking? What's going on? Why is there something, is there something right here?
[1388.63s -> 1396.02s]  Why, why? Everything's changing. Everything looks like weird now. Maybe I'm just going absolutely
[1396.02s -> 1410.10s]  crazy. Floor seven. Oh, I don't know how much longer I can do scary games. Oh, hi. Thanks for
[1410.10s -> 1416.50s]  closing in on me. I appreciate it. Come on. Something jumped out at me. I'm ready. I'm ready.
[1416.50s -> 1421.78s]  I'm ready to just, just, just throw up on my screen. Come on. I know what this means. I know
[1421.78s -> 1424.82s]  what this means. Something's going to happen right now. Something's going to happen right now. I know
[1424.82s -> 1431.14s]  it. I've been here before. We've been down this road before, man. Yeah. I see you. I see it. I can
[1431.14s -> 1452.46s]  see it. What? Yeah. Hi. What was that noise? What is going on? What is going on? I am, I'm ready to
[1452.46s -> 1476.44s]  just jump and run. Oh, no floor number. No. Okay. Hey, whoa. Hi. Damn man. Come on. Hey, how are
[1476.44s -> 1480.44s]  you? How's your, how's your kids and your wife and your, and your son? How's it? I heard he plays
[1480.44s -> 1492.92s]  baseball now. Good to see him. Yeah. He's growing. He's big. I need the chat's help. Hold on chat.
[1492.92s -> 1502.97s]  What do you think? What do I do? All right. Okay. I got, I have the support from the chat. I'm ready.
[1502.97s -> 1510.30s]  I'm ready to play the game now. Oh, I don't even want to see it. I don't even want to see it. I
[1510.30s -> 1516.46s]  know it's going to be something to be. Oh, was that a bug? What the hell was that? I don't know
[1516.46s -> 1521.18s]  if you could just see that right there, but I did. A bubble just came out of my mouth, a floating like
[1521.18s -> 1534.38s]  soap bubble. Don't ask me how the hell that happened. God, I'm about to rage quit this game
[1534.38s -> 1538.70s]  because I can't handle it because this game I know is horrible when it comes to things jumping at
[1538.70s -> 1552.87s]  you. What if I just put my head down? Oh man, this is worse than, this is probably worse than slender.
[1553.51s -> 1561.59s]  I'm about to hit escape. I'm, my hand is on escape right now. I'm about to just exit the game.
[1561.59s -> 1574.14s]  It's on, my hand is on escape. The second I see something I don't like it, I'm hitting it.
[1574.14s -> 1584.90s]  Man, come on, show me something scary so I can just insta quit the game. It's throwing all kinds
[1584.90s -> 1595.22s]  of noises. Bye. See you later. Have fun. Have fun. Slender man, whatever the, who the hell you are.
[1602.07s -> 1614.82s]  Did you see that damn thing? It was like right here on the screen. That was hard. That was horrible.
[1614.82s -> 1635.42s]  Oh wow. That was so stupid. Oh, all right. Give me a second. That one took a lot out of me right
[1635.42s -> 1651.96s]  there. Oh, I think I might have to change my pants. Let's see. Let's, let's, let's check. Nope, I'm fine.
[1656.81s -> 1663.21s]  Oh, all right. I need a break. I need like a five second break. I want to play containment breach. I
[1663.21s -> 1667.40s]  don't know why I can't get it to load. Hold on. Let me try loading this again. This is, this is stupid.
[1667.40s -> 1681.90s]  It should load. Open. Yes, I want you to run. No, why? I had, I ran earlier. Hold on a second. Give me
[1681.90s -> 1704.71s]  a second. Let me go options. Change this to 1600 by 900. I haven't set to launcher. Let's do launcher.
[1704.71s -> 1709.62s]  Okay. I think I got it. I'm going to get it. I got it. I'm going to get it guys. Watch this magic
[1709.62s -> 1720.71s]  right here. Watch this magic you're about to see right here. Are we ready for the magic?
[1721.27s -> 1728.34s]  Here comes the magic. Here it comes. And for my next trick, I'm not going to be able to do the
[1728.34s -> 1734.60s]  magic trick because it still doesn't work. Wait, wait, wait a second. I could get this to a hold
[1734.60s -> 1756.34s]  on screen. False launcher enabled. Yeah. I mean like, hello. Of course. Damn it. Yeah. I'm getting
[1756.34s -> 1763.50s]  that memory access violation, whatever the hell it is. Run it as administrator. Good call. Good call.
[1763.50s -> 1767.27s]  Those of you that said that, good call, because that's probably what's going to happen. It's
[1767.27s -> 1776.30s]  going to work right now. I had this working too. I made sure it worked before I started the stream
[1776.30s -> 1784.18s]  and it worked. Now it's being a real piece of crap. All right. Run as administrator.
[1784.18s -> 1797.26s]  And that's what I want. That's what I want. Launch again. That's what I want. Launch. Nope.
[1797.26s -> 1805.80s]  It's not going to launch. Oh, it looks like I'm going to have to drink a bunch of Dr. Pepper
[1805.80s -> 1819.24s]  that. I mean, come on. What if I just like freaking puked? How many like, how many like people
[1819.24s -> 1822.68s]  you think would want to see that if I was just like, oh yeah, you know, I'm going to say drink
[1822.68s -> 1831.05s]  some Dr. Pepper. I just like hurled all over the place. I would, I wish I could see something like
[1831.05s -> 1839.72s]  that. I would laugh my absolute ass off if I got to see something like that. I do. Me, me, me, me.
[1840.36s -> 1847.00s]  That's so funny. Well, it looks like we're playing contain 087B again, which is my favorite game of
[1847.00s -> 1854.20s]  all time. After this, I'm going to play some TF2. So stick around. You're not going to want to miss
[1854.20s -> 1861.46s]  this. I can't believe I'm loading this game up again. I did not want to play contain 087B again.
[1861.46s -> 1871.24s]  I wanted to play it once and that was it. I didn't want to have to do this damn game more than once.
[1871.24s -> 1880.14s]  Here we go. It's going to be like, so I prepare your ears. I'm warning you guys right now, turn
[1880.14s -> 1885.72s]  your headphones down because I got to catch this. If I don't catch it immediately, then it's going
[1885.72s -> 1893.43s]  to be an issue. So give me a minute. Let me make sure the face cam is nice and big in the corner.
[1893.43s -> 1904.87s]  Here we go. I got to make sure the mixer is here. Wait, wait, wait. Why does it say containment
[1904.87s -> 1913.78s]  breach is in the background? Hold on a second. Hold on a second. One second here. I think the reason
[1913.86s -> 1920.87s]  why it's screwing up is because it thinks it's running in the background. Oh, whatever. I don't
[1920.87s -> 1925.45s]  want to waste your guys' time anymore. You guys have been patient. Let's do it. You guys have been
[1925.45s -> 1941.66s]  patient. Let's do it. Here we go. Here we go. I'm just stalling as much as I can. Here we go.
[1944.04s -> 1952.70s]  Super Crate Box? That's a great game. I don't want to click this button. I don't want to play
[1952.70s -> 1956.70s]  this game again, but you know what? I'm going to play it again because you have to man up sometimes
[1956.70s -> 1975.94s]  and do it. So here we go. All right. Please proceed with caution. Please. I'll give you.
[1975.94s -> 1991.48s]  No, what's this? Oh, Smite. That game's fun. What if I just don't look at the screen once?
[1991.48s -> 2000.81s]  What the? See you later. Bye. No. No. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
[2002.06s -> 2015.05s]  See ya. That's not happening. Did you see that? It just was like, all right, fine. Fine. Fine. We'll
[2015.05s -> 2033.37s]  do it again. We'll do it again. I don't want two in there. If you missed what just happened,
[2033.37s -> 2037.69s]  something just flashed on the screen. Like a face just flashed in my face.
[2039.11s -> 2048.06s]  It looked like the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. What happens if I go down here?
[2054.04s -> 2069.78s]  What? Third time's a charm, guys. I can't believe it. You gotta be kidding me. Oh,
[2069.78s -> 2081.32s]  make sure you don't fall down the hall and die. Let's go. This is going to be the real one.
[2081.32s -> 2085.22s]  I'm not going to do any dumb mistakes and I'm not going to leave right off the bat.
[2088.28s -> 2093.86s]  Yeah, I know. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure I know that that's where I am at this point. You
[2093.86s -> 2099.40s]  don't have to keep telling me. Well, let me get like the dust off my screen because it's making
[2099.40s -> 2109.16s]  me think that there's stuff on there. You are now entering some gauntlet legends. You are now
[2109.16s -> 2115.72s]  entering the crypt of the spider kingdom or something, whatever it was. Just keep talking
[2115.72s -> 2119.88s]  and I won't be scared. Just keep talking. Just keep making noises with your mouth and you won't
[2119.88s -> 2122.12s]  be scared about things that are jumping out at you on the screen.
[2128.79s -> 2137.80s]  You know what, man? I am just so sick of your- Why do you have to keep doing that?
[2146.46s -> 2150.30s]  What? What? What is this? What the hell is this? Why is there- What's this?
[2151.27s -> 2159.66s]  Stair- Why? Where am I? I don't have a flashlight. I don't even know where I am. Do I go in there
[2159.66s -> 2171.54s]  or do I go over here? I don't know. I don't- I don't know. Do it with one eye. If I do it with
[2171.54s -> 2176.76s]  one eye, it's not that bad. If I do it with one eye, it's still as bad. It's still just as bad
[2176.76s -> 2181.72s]  with one eye. Forget that. Never mind what I just said. It's still just as bad with one eye closed.
[2181.72s -> 2188.49s]  What about both eyes closed? But I can't see where I'm going. Things are getting weird looking
[2188.49s -> 2194.65s]  again. Things are getting like green and like opaque and- Oh, this is it. Get me out of here.
[2196.66s -> 2210.28s]  Pinkies on escape. Stop it. Hi. This is what happened last time and then the thing jumped
[2210.28s -> 2228.57s]  out at me. Floor 10. If you- I gotta think of a song, a nice happy song. Hold on.
[2230.68s -> 2237.67s]  Raindrops keep falling on my head, but I don't believe my life's a true beauty.
[2238.55s -> 2245.83s]  Red, red, the super bad, red, the raindrops keep falling on my head. They keep falling,
[2246.63s -> 2257.19s]  but blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. I don't know the lyrics, but it's helping lots. It is helping
[2257.19s -> 2274.60s]  lots when- No, it's not. No. Just get- Oh, man. I'm down pretty far. I didn't get down this far
[2274.60s -> 2288.44s]  last time. I think I did. I don't remember. It's just a blur at this point. 15. Hi. Itchy nose. Itchy
[2288.44s -> 2292.36s]  nose. It's a way for me to pretend like I have an itchy nose so I can not look at the screen
[2292.36s -> 2313.30s]  kind of really maybe. God damn it, man. Get them. I'm not going down further. I'm not going down
[2313.30s -> 2346.12s]  further than that. Containment breach. This game hurts my head. Wow. Beatbox the Halloween theme.
[2347.32s -> 2361.82s]  I'll do that. Well, how does it go? Here we go, ready? Let's see if I can do this.
[2361.82s -> 2368.90s]  because it's halloween makes sense right well it's not halloween right now but it will be
[2368.90s -> 2391.37s]  here we go i can't even do it it's too hard i'll slow it down hold on
[2393.75s -> 2409.00s]  that was better that was a little bit better i tried to do it like way too fast the first time
[2409.00s -> 2413.83s]  like that wasn't gonna work all right
