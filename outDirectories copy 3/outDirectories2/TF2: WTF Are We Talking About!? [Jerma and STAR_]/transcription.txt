[0.31s -> 13.35s]  This is gonna be you want to get bake-stabbed part two. Do you want to go to sleep a little bit?
[13.35s -> 18.15s]  Hey, you want to go to sleep? You want to go to sleep? You want to get sleep slabs?
[18.47s -> 20.84s]  Hey, you want to get sleep-stabbed?
[21.32s -> 27.29s]  You want to get sleep-stabbed? I don't want to get sleep-stabbed. Is it like when you go to sleep,
[27.59s -> 30.49s]  but a spy was like actually disguised as your bed?
[31.21s -> 39.28s]  I can't even like play because you just said that. Come here, I got you.
[44.35s -> 47.63s]  You want to get sleep-stabbed? I don't want to get sleep-stabbed.
[49.07s -> 56.30s]  The spy is just like a big square. I don't know how he does it. What am I voting for?
[64.19s -> 69.37s]  What are you singing? Is that copyright? Is that copyright? Yes. Then are you singing a
[69.37s -> 78.46s]  copyrighted song? You're gonna get me arrested. Hey, I only copyright when I'm Fourth of July.
[78.46s -> 82.94s]  I can't believe I got that guy. Actually, you know what? I can believe that because I should
[82.94s -> 92.57s]  have got him. Yeah, you had it in you the whole time. I hope I did. What are you playing as right
[92.57s -> 99.08s]  now? The snipper rifle guy, the Australian long shoot man. Oh, the guy with like the
[99.08s -> 106.89s]  elephant hunting rifle? Yeah. Well, you can take down a wildebeest with this. When are they gonna
[106.89s -> 116.03s]  put in a hunting rifle in TF2? Damn it. When are you gonna make a new huntsman with changed stats?
[116.03s -> 124.25s]  When are you gonna make a crossbow that on headshot does 700,000% more damage than the
[124.25s -> 133.53s]  huntsman and on body shot, you fucking EXE crash out of TF2? That would be actually really cool.
[133.53s -> 141.32s]  I like that idea. Yeah, you don't get a headshot, you HL2.EXE crash if you don't get a headshot.
[141.32s -> 145.08s]  What happens if you miss? Like you don't get a body shot, but you miss? Does it still crash?
[145.08s -> 152.00s]  No. What happens? Does your FPS drop by 10 every time you miss? Yeah, your FPS drops by 10 every
[152.00s -> 160.62s]  time you miss. And if you land a headshot, it goes back up. Oh, I'm just like walking around.
[161.42s -> 169.42s]  It's the skill based mechanic. The periwinkle. Insert funny name here because I'm tired and I
[169.42s -> 174.83s]  don't know funny names. Periwinkle. No, but periwinkle. No, that sounds like a Christmas toy.
[177.02s -> 181.18s]  Are you saying that it's not a Christmas toy? It has like festive lights on it.
[181.18s -> 193.61s]  Touche. Touche. Gotcha. Touche. God, Hamlet's headshot him in the air. Kill me.
[193.61s -> 199.56s]  Oh, crashed the desktop. No, my FPS is just dropping. Oh, body shot.
[201.56s -> 209.95s]  How about a rocket launcher that has one shot, that has one bullet in it, and it moves like
[209.95s -> 214.59s]  two miles per hour. When you shoot it, it moves incredibly slow. It's like a turtle,
[214.59s -> 220.16s]  but wherever it lands or wherever it hits, explodes the size. Hey, hold on before you go
[220.16s -> 224.83s]  any further with this. Why is everyone always going to make fun of turtles? What's what we mean?
[224.83s -> 230.25s]  Oh, it's so slow. It's like a turtle. Because turtles are frigging slow. Not all of them.
[230.25s -> 237.58s]  You've met a fast turtle? Yeah. What's his name? That's my grandfather. How is that not a headshot?
[237.58s -> 242.51s]  That was like a shoulder shot. I tell you my grandfather's a turtle and all you have to say
[242.51s -> 247.71s]  is, oh, how was that not a headshot? You're very supportive, Jerma. Your grandfather was really a
[247.71s -> 257.31s]  turtle? Yes. What was his name? Longbeard. Longbeard the turtle. Yeah, he was a pirate too. So he had
[257.31s -> 262.56s]  like a pirate name, like Longbeard. Because every pirate is named after their beard. You got red
[262.56s -> 269.26s]  beard, long beard, yellow beard, gold beard, Johnny Locks beard. We're going to have to call
[269.26s -> 276.16s]  Burger Boy Cheese Crumbs because that's what is always in his beard. That's actually a really good
[276.16s -> 284.27s]  pirate name. Hey, Cheese Crumbs, get over here. The same scout has hit me with every single move.
[284.59s -> 292.99s]  You know, how about that one? Yeah. Oh, right when I was like starting to do like decent and by
[292.99s -> 297.56s]  decent, I mean like luckily shoot one dude in the face. Oh, get me. You're not going to get me.
[297.56s -> 301.48s]  Too bad. You're not going to get me. I'm standing right behind him. You don't even have, you have no
[301.48s -> 310.30s]  idea. You have no idea. You're not going to get me. What team was I just, what's going on here?
[310.30s -> 317.02s]  I'm so confused. What was happening? If you have reserve slot, I think you do. They can't kill you
[317.10s -> 327.56s]  at the end of the round. Oh, yo, Merry Christmas. That's that. Why is your server have yo Merry
[327.56s -> 336.41s]  Christmas? It's festive and shit. Yeah, but it's not Christmas anymore. Anymore. It's always
[336.41s -> 342.25s]  Christmas. You just had like the Huntsman with the lights on it. Yeah, but that's, but I didn't mean
[342.25s -> 350.81s]  to. Christmas isn't a holiday. It's a way of life. I guess you're right. Cause you wake up in the
[350.81s -> 359.45s]  morning. You're like, yo, Merry Christmas. Yo, Merry Christmas. Is that what you do when you wake
[359.45s -> 366.33s]  up? That's the first thing I say. I wake up, I look at the ceiling and I go, yo, Merry Christmas.
[366.33s -> 373.95s]  And then I diarrhea every single morning. Let's edit that part out. Cause I don't want people to
[373.95s -> 382.81s]  know that I diarrhea every morning. I think they know. I think they, they can just guess. Oh, you
[382.81s -> 392.83s]  know that guy German? Oh yeah. He diaries every morning. How did I not kill that scout? No,
[394.80s -> 402.68s]  you Swayze son of a bitch. Hi, I have ham. Tyco RC is about to charge up his batteries for his race
[402.68s -> 408.04s]  car and have the battery only last 15 minutes after like a six hour charge. What is this guy
[408.04s -> 419.12s]  doing over here? Are you, what are you hiding from? Are you protecting this rock? All right.
[419.12s -> 424.06s]  Yeah, I guess he was protected. We are at the last point. It makes a little bit of sense. I guess
[424.06s -> 430.27s]  got to protect that rock because once you lose the rock, everyone could just walk into mortar
[430.27s -> 439.55s]  mortar. All right. New, new tests to see if I can do this. I have to stay alive on star server for
[439.55s -> 452.94s]  more than 15 seconds. See if I can do it. Is that you? Are you the pyro? Nope. Nope. Oh, your,
[452.94s -> 461.44s]  your pathetic little grenades just bounce off my manly chest. Come on. Shoot me again. Didn't work.
[461.44s -> 468.78s]  It didn't even work. Oh, I didn't know it protects it against that. I am completely protected. Okay.
[468.78s -> 474.32s]  Let's see how long you stay alive at the mid fight. Okay. If I die at this mid fight, I have to like
[474.32s -> 479.74s]  drink the rest of my ice coffee as fast as I can. That'll hurt your head. God damn it. Why did I
[479.74s -> 486.16s]  just say that? That was not a good idea. That means I have to stay alive. That'll hurt your head.
[486.16s -> 492.03s]  Don't hide in the corner either. No, I'm going, I'm going up balls to the wall. This is happening.
[492.03s -> 502.36s]  I cannot die here. Mid fight. Here we go, baby. Smoke it. That was a terrible jump. Smoke it.
[502.36s -> 509.05s]  No, get this pyro out of here. I lived. I don't have to drink my ice coffee as fast as I can.
[509.05s -> 516.70s]  I'm going to come kill you like right now though. No, you're not. Oh, I thought you didn't have
[516.70s -> 524.40s]  that much health. It's okay. It's okay. I've died from like 30 scouts since hitting F9.
[524.40s -> 533.08s]  I have like jello vision right now. Did you do something to me? No, I didn't do anything.
[533.08s -> 540.11s]  Did you like give me drugs? What's going on? Oh my God. This is bad. This is real bad.
[540.88s -> 555.79s]  It's serious. Hey, tell me when you respawn. All right. You guys can have a comeback.
[555.79s -> 562.59s]  Are you about to give me like 100% corrects and no clip? Are you, are you respawn? I am spawned.
[562.59s -> 569.28s]  I am spawned. Good luck. What is this thing? Oh no, do it again. I walked into like a freaking
[569.28s -> 578.33s]  resupply. Oh, what does this thing mean? What does this thing do? Just have fun. Just shoot a guy.
[578.33s -> 590.57s]  Oh dear Lord. Oh boy. Oh no. People are going to think I'm a legitimate hacker.
[591.53s -> 603.10s]  I got killed. Some pyro blew the rocket back. I went spy because I was going to try and kill
[603.10s -> 609.96s]  you while you were like that, but. Dude, I died within 10 seconds of me having that thing.
[609.96s -> 613.64s]  Can I have it again? I don't know. I don't know if I can trust you.
[614.12s -> 628.11s]  Let me have it again. All right. This time I promise I'll make use of it. Yay. What is it? Oh,
[628.11s -> 635.36s]  right. God, no. Oh, that's you. Stabbed you in the back. Now I'm Swayze. Just give yourself
[635.36s -> 643.12s]  the valve rocket launcher. I could no clip. Just no clip and stop backstabbing people.
[643.68s -> 650.24s]  You know what? You know what, Jerma? You know what? That's a good idea. I just want to see this.
[656.75s -> 666.16s]  Waiting. Oh damn it. I was like waiting to watch and I got friggin' cabred. I actually died.
[669.74s -> 680.70s]  Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I feel bad for that Angie.
[681.42s -> 687.55s]  Like of all the ways for your sentry to go down, the spy who just came through the wall
[687.55s -> 691.87s]  was probably like the worst. Can we have just like another no clip fight?
