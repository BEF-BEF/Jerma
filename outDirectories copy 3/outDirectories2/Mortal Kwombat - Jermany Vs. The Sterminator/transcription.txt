[0.31s -> 13.14s]  Mummy vs Kruger. Are you ready to get thrown into the flames of Kruger?
[13.14s -> 21.14s]  Do you even know a single button to this game? I don't want to do strategy games because people will expect some level of skill.
[21.14s -> 26.07s]  Just hold on a second. We need to make sure we...hold on. I gotta get my buttons in check.
[26.07s -> 37.42s]  So before we get started, we need to do a button check. So okay, button check. That's that. That's that. Okay. Button check. I'm just button checking.
[38.42s -> 39.42s]  I'm okay with this.
[40.66s -> 43.66s]  Alright, button check is still going on. Alright, my button check's good. Good, play.
[43.66s -> 47.82s]  You wanna mess with the Kruger?
[48.82s -> 49.82s]  You wanna mess with the Kruger?
[52.76s -> 56.76s]  You wanna mess with Freddy Kruger? You wanna mess with me? You ready to go?
[58.76s -> 64.69s]  I wasn't expecting this, to be honest with you.
[65.69s -> 73.42s]  It's cause Freddy Kruger is like broken. What the hell are you doing? You're like sucking out my soul.
[73.42s -> 75.60s]  You wanna play this game?
[78.99s -> 84.36s]  Oh, how do you do like the X-Factor? How do I like sing on UK television? The X-Factor.
[84.36s -> 85.36s]  I don't care.
[89.03s -> 90.03s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[90.03s -> 94.70s]  Fuck. Get crushed.
[102.98s -> 107.38s]  This game is brutal. Are you not gonna do anything?
[109.70s -> 111.70s]  I did it wrong. I did it wrong.
[111.70s -> 118.07s]  Dude, that was horrible. You just jumped up and like you broke my neck and then you shattered my spine.
[118.07s -> 122.66s]  You know who I honestly thought would have, Jerma would have picked immediately?
[122.66s -> 123.66s]  Who?
[123.66s -> 126.11s]  Look at his face.
[126.11s -> 128.11s]  But that's Baraka though. Baraka is like Baraka.
[128.11s -> 130.11s]  Barack Obama is like, we talk about him all the time.
[130.11s -> 135.11s]  I don't wanna play as Barack Obama. I wanna play as the God of War Kratos.
[135.11s -> 136.11s]  Okay.
[136.11s -> 139.48s]  Either God of War Kratos or like this beady-eyed motherfucker.
[139.48s -> 143.48s]  Because this is Mortal Kombat. This is the storyline.
[143.48s -> 145.48s]  Oh, actually no, I have seen this. This is where Stryker is, right?
[145.48s -> 149.48s]  Uh, Kill Cool, we were playing. We were like actually playing and not like looking at something.
[149.48s -> 153.13s]  Oh my fucking God.
[153.13s -> 158.07s]  Are you gonna seriously just combo the shit out of me while we're like looking at like stuff in the background?
[158.07s -> 160.89s]  Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[160.89s -> 162.89s]  Alright, if that's how it's gonna be.
[162.89s -> 164.89s]  Can you get it by the car?
[164.89s -> 167.64s]  There's stage specific fatalities.
[167.64s -> 169.64s]  Oh, cool.
[169.64s -> 173.97s]  If you flawless me right now, this control is going through the fucking wall.
[173.97s -> 176.97s]  Well, that's some motivation.
[176.97s -> 182.81s]  You seriously cannot flawless me right now. Do anything, desperation.
[182.81s -> 185.26s]  No.
[185.26s -> 186.26s]  Yes.
[186.26s -> 187.26s]  No.
[187.26s -> 190.26s]  Oh, with this. With this. I spam it in my own face.
[190.26s -> 192.26s]  It would just break your neck. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay.
[192.26s -> 194.82s]  Cyrax.
[194.82s -> 199.20s]  Oh, teleportation.
[199.20s -> 201.20s]  I'm a robot.
[201.20s -> 205.44s]  Where is Star? Star is going to be exterminated.
[205.44s -> 209.68s]  I am the robot character. Star will be exterminated.
[209.68s -> 212.07s]  Are you a Dalek?
[212.07s -> 214.82s]  Star will be exterminated.
[214.82s -> 217.45s]  Oh, it's water. It's water.
[217.45s -> 219.45s]  Get her off me.
[219.45s -> 222.58s]  It's water. Oh, God.
[222.58s -> 224.58s]  Oh, fuck.
[234.62s -> 236.62s]  That went on for way too long.
[236.62s -> 239.62s]  That went on for way too long.
[247.16s -> 249.66s]  Alright, what's the funny thing you wanted to show me?
[249.66s -> 251.66s]  The water is what I wanted to show you.
[251.66s -> 253.66s]  Oh, that was the funny thing? Oh, okay.
[253.66s -> 256.73s]  That's pretty funny.

[288.16s -> 291.16s]  Coming soon to Disney DVD.
[291.16s -> 295.04s]  John Cena versus the mummy.
[295.04s -> 299.46s]  Okay, now you're playing the character you know how to play.
[299.46s -> 301.46s]  That's cheating.
[301.46s -> 303.46s]  Oh, he has a gun?
[303.46s -> 305.76s]  Oh, it's okay. I'll just shoot you.
[305.76s -> 310.05s]  Oh, it's okay. I'll just shoot you.
[310.05s -> 312.05s]  I'll give you a chance to kind of do it again.
[312.05s -> 314.05s]  Oh, yeah? Oh, the flashlight!

[325.06s -> 327.06s]  And now I shoot you.
[327.06s -> 332.88s]  That flashlight was sick.
[332.88s -> 334.88s]  I'm going to defeat the mortal human being.
[334.88s -> 340.05s]  Ooh!

[428.64s -> 430.64s]  Confirmed favorite character
[430.64s -> 433.20s]  in the game. Because people throw up
[433.20s -> 435.20s]  when they get kicked in the balls.
[435.20s -> 442.37s]  No, okay. This is tied up.
[442.37s -> 444.37s]  I'm going to stop messing around here and do some
[444.37s -> 456.19s]  moves. Whoa!
[456.19s -> 458.93s]  What? What's going on?
[458.93s -> 460.93s]  Okay, well the game decided you don't want to have a video.
