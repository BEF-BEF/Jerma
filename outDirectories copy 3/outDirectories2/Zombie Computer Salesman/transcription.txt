[191.58s -> 202.26s]  47 inches. So you're going to be just with the real, the sheer quality of the craftsmanship.
[202.26s -> 205.70s]  I can tell you right now, it's going to take a whole lot to break this. What the fuck are you
[205.70s -> 212.18s]  doing? Hey, I just, uh, I want to know, I mean, I know you guys don't sell these here, but, uh,
[212.18s -> 218.02s]  I mean, can I possibly return this? Yeah, for maybe a banana. Oh, okay. That sounds good. So
[218.02s -> 224.42s]  you get the computer and I get the bananas. The banana? Okay. This thing is so slow.

[290.81s -> 295.45s]  That was so bad. I, my first rule is I'm going to be the karate master.
[296.41s -> 301.77s]  Do not want to screw this up. Big time, big time, big time, hard time, hard time.
[302.41s -> 305.69s]  Maybe there's a motorcycle there. I'm not sure if you want that, but you can take it if you want.
