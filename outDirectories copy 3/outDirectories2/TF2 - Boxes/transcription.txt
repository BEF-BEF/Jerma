[0.00s -> 13.20s]  Hey, what's happening guys? Today, we're gonna be doing TF2. We're gonna be opening up some boxes.
[13.20s -> 22.62s]  I've opened up quite a few of these already, and we're just gonna get into it. Hopefully I get something good, because I've been shafted quite a few times.
[22.62s -> 28.24s]  So, enjoy the unboxing. Let's go ahead and get number one open. It's a lightning rod field tested.
[28.24s -> 36.20s]  You know what? You know what? Get them all open. You know, get them all open. Open them all right now, at the same time.
[36.20s -> 45.20s]  Yeah, come on. No, I take it back. No, no, no. Oh, shit. I just blew through that. That was so stupid. What an impulsive, stupid idea.
[45.20s -> 55.62s]  And now I got a backpack that's in even worse shape than it was before this update, and it was in pretty bad shape before.
[55.62s -> 68.38s]  But look at this. I got so many of these now, from doing contracts and opening cases. I don't know. I counted. I have 13 of the McDonald's Happy Meal Shotgun.
[68.38s -> 78.57s]  What am I supposed to do with this stuff? Look at how many of these I have. Like, this one is well-worn with a strange on it. I don't even know what these things are worth.
[78.57s -> 89.63s]  And look, look at this. I didn't even notice this before. Why do I have 10 strange knives? What purpose do these serve? You know, I'm just gonna take the backpack off.
[89.63s -> 102.82s]  I just gotta get it off. Just get it off and take a look inside and see what you're actually working with. I don't know what this is. I don't know what that is.
[102.82s -> 113.82s]  It might be a strange... Here's a scatter gun. I want to keep this. This is my strange scatter gun. This is my Tommy Slav. I know I have to hold onto that because it's worth like 15 cents.
[113.82s -> 130.60s]  Here's... Oh, Jesus. What? This is a fucking dog bone? There's no dog bone item in TF2. I don't know where that came from. This is part of a sandwich, obviously.
[131.60s -> 137.78s]  I just... I don't know what to... I don't know what to do with this stuff! I have too much of it!
[137.78s -> 142.49s]  Hey, if you're going... Hey!
[142.49s -> 143.49s]  I'll be right back.
[143.49s -> 156.90s]  No, hit me up some french fries. The good ones from Wendy's. Are you listening to me? Fucking idiot.
[156.90s -> 161.14s]  Ten knives. You gotta have ten knives, don't you?
[162.14s -> 182.72s]  Hello. Hey. What's going on, dude? How you doing? You're outside right now? Yeah, yeah. Just give me a second. I'll be right out.
[182.72s -> 188.54s]  I'm so glad you're here. It's been like a year since I last saw you. You want to do something? What do you want to do? You want to go out?
[188.54s -> 191.54s]  I don't have any more room. This is your problem now.
[191.54s -> 192.54s]  What?
[193.54s -> 198.49s]  Come on, man.
[198.49s -> 200.49s]  That was my first time!
[200.49s -> 204.93s]  Jesus.
[205.93s -> 214.45s]  Ow.
[214.45s -> 215.45s]  Damn.
[223.92s -> 224.92s]  Assistant?
[224.92s -> 225.92s]  Yes?
[225.92s -> 226.92s]  Get in this room.
[226.92s -> 229.92s]  What's wrong, sir? What's wrong? What's wrong?
[229.92s -> 230.92s]  You piece of crap.
[230.92s -> 231.92s]  What?
[231.92s -> 234.92s]  I called you fifteen seconds ago, maybe even twenty. And it took you this long?
[234.92s -> 235.92s]  I'm so sorry, sir.
[235.92s -> 236.92s]  Get that fucking door open.
[236.92s -> 238.92s]  I'm so sorry. Thank you, sir.
[238.92s -> 244.92s]  You know what? The next time you're late like that, the next... Connor is a real bitch. You do something like that again?
[244.92s -> 248.92s]  You embarrass me like that in front of all these fifty-five million people? You're fired.
[248.92s -> 249.92s]  I'm so sorry.
[249.92s -> 250.92s]  Oh, shit!
[260.69s -> 261.69s]  I'm fucking dead.
