[0.00s -> 4.24s]  What is going on guys, it is Jerma bringing you a couple of gameplay commentaries.
[4.24s -> 8.16s]  This is going to be a little different though. It's a new series I want to try and do
[8.16s -> 11.52s]  maybe like once or twice every month. I'm not going to do this all the time.
[11.52s -> 14.40s]  But it's a fun little change of pace, fun little different thing to do.
[14.40s -> 16.96s]  Not, you know, do the same gameplay commentaries over and over again.
[17.52s -> 22.56s]  This is called one life is the tentative term I'm going to, you know, use.
[22.56s -> 26.88s]  Basically, I'm only going to show you one life from maybe two classes in each one
[26.88s -> 28.58s]  because I don't want to go too long.
[28.66s -> 33.14s]  So this is going to be a demo man and a sniper gameplay huntsman sniper gameplay.
[33.14s -> 36.66s]  And I'm only going to show you the first life that I have the one life that I'm going to show you.
[36.66s -> 40.54s]  So without further ado, let's get started with the demo man.
[40.54s -> 45.84s]  I'm using the default sticky launcher, the lock and load and the Persian Persuader.
[45.84s -> 49.76s]  I really like this setup. This has become my default demo man setup.
[49.76s -> 52.96s]  I used to hate the lock and load because I thought it was real counterintuitive
[52.96s -> 56.40s]  to the demo man's play style. You're losing that ability to launch
[56.40s -> 60.16s]  grenades across corners and hit people you didn't even know were there.
[60.16s -> 61.60s]  And I hate losing that.
[61.60s -> 65.60s]  But the precise direct hit style gameplay that you have with the lock and load
[65.60s -> 66.96s]  makes things a little more interesting.
[66.96s -> 70.88s]  So you're not this robot that's just shooting out bombs and grenades
[70.88s -> 74.53s]  everywhere without even thinking like a lot of demo man do.
[74.53s -> 77.89s]  So if you're one of those demo men that just shoot stickies and grenades
[77.89s -> 82.13s]  in random places, then watch this gameplay and pretend to know
[82.13s -> 84.37s]  that I think I know what I pretend that I know what I'm doing.
[86.37s -> 89.81s]  So anyways, make that medic pop over with a couple of stickies.
[89.81s -> 93.89s]  Long range boom on that sniper, which is the cool part about the lock and load
[93.89s -> 98.53s]  because you can kill half the classes in the game with one or two shots directly.
[99.09s -> 102.29s]  Make all these guys have to run back into spawn because it's spread out
[102.29s -> 103.73s]  among two or three of them.
[103.73s -> 106.45s]  This pyro runs right over one of my sticky crits.
[106.45s -> 109.57s]  Turn around, shoot the demo man in the face and a sniper headshots him.
[109.57s -> 111.09s]  So good job, sniper.
[111.09s -> 113.41s]  So I collect some health and come up the stairs.
[113.49s -> 116.61s]  Soldier gets taken up by the team and in comes an uber charge.
[116.61s -> 117.81s]  So I don't go head on.
[117.81s -> 121.33s]  I'm going to come from the side, collect a little bit of health and ammo,
[121.33s -> 125.76s]  turn around, shoot this demo man on the cart, get him with a nice direct shot.
[125.76s -> 131.12s]  And now let's talk about the Persian Persuader and why I only have like three shots left.
[131.12s -> 133.20s]  But Jerma, didn't you just collect some ammo?
[133.20s -> 137.44s]  No, I did not because the Persian Persuader does not allow you to collect ammo.
[137.44s -> 140.98s]  The only way you can get it is from this, a dispenser.
[140.98s -> 146.50s]  But the huge upside to this weapon is the fact that all ammo collected on the ground
[146.50s -> 148.10s]  just becomes health.
[148.10s -> 151.70s]  So how many times have you been in a situation where there's a health pack somewhere
[151.70s -> 153.94s]  and somebody takes it and you're just sitting there like, oh shit,
[153.94s -> 155.22s]  now I got to sit here and wait for it.
[155.22s -> 156.82s]  I have like 40 health.
[156.82s -> 161.22s]  That is down the drain because you can just pick up the ammo box that's right next to it.
[161.22s -> 165.12s]  I whip out the lock and load here and I thought there was at least one shot in it,
[165.12s -> 166.64s]  but apparently not.
[166.64s -> 170.32s]  So I get myself killed and that's the one life as the demo man.
[170.32s -> 172.88s]  So now let's move on to the sniper.
[172.88s -> 177.52s]  I'm using a Huntsman, the Girardi and the Shashahashasha.
[177.52s -> 179.28s]  I will never know how to pronounce that.
[179.28s -> 183.12s]  I probably could just look at it and say the Shahenshah, but whatever.
[183.12s -> 185.17s]  I like the Shashahashasha.
[185.17s -> 187.89s]  So this is also on Badwater as you can see.
[187.89s -> 191.04s]  Using the Girardi on that group coming at the cart.
[191.04s -> 194.56s]  Take a shot at the heavy, completely miss and hit the medic behind him.
[194.56s -> 196.88s]  So I'm totally cool with that.
[196.88s -> 200.26s]  Somebody else comes up the cart here and I just shoot him right in the face.
[200.26s -> 205.20s]  Talking about the Huntsman now, the Huntsman, if you want to get better with the Huntsman,
[205.20s -> 207.20s]  if you say, Jerma, I don't know how to use the Huntsman.
[207.20s -> 208.32s]  How do you, how do you get so good?
[208.32s -> 208.88s]  What do you do?
[209.44s -> 213.12s]  Go play a game called Space Invaders.
[213.12s -> 216.80s]  The Huntsman is just Space Invaders in 3D.
[216.80s -> 219.04s]  That's pretty much all I need to say.
[219.04s -> 221.92s]  Just go play Space Invaders and you'll get better with the Huntsman.
[221.92s -> 223.58s]  I promise you that.
[223.58s -> 228.93s]  While we're on the subject, here's a little bit of TF2 trivia for you.
[228.93s -> 234.85s]  Robin Walker, who is the lead developer for TF2 and Valve, stated in an interview one time
[234.85s -> 240.16s]  that his favorite item they ever made in TF2 was the Huntsman.
[240.16s -> 243.60s]  And to be honest, I think I completely agree with him.
[243.60s -> 246.98s]  Because I really can't think of another item that they've made
[246.98s -> 251.36s]  that's as interesting, as fun, as funny as the Huntsman.
[251.36s -> 253.52s]  And I don't even play Huntsman Sniper that often.
[253.52s -> 255.74s]  It's just, that's true.
[255.74s -> 259.62s]  Now a lot of you guys are going to debate the fact that I just said that.
[259.62s -> 260.98s]  That's fine, that's cool.
[260.98s -> 264.02s]  I'm just giving you a little bit of trivia about the game.
[264.02s -> 267.94s]  So let's get back to the gameplay so we don't start talking about like Flame Wars.
[267.94s -> 269.78s]  And no, Natasha's better.
[269.78s -> 272.34s]  No, the freaking Gordie Bomb's better.
[272.34s -> 273.86s]  No, that item isn't even in the game.
[273.86s -> 276.34s]  I don't even know what item I just tried to make up right there.
[276.34s -> 280.14s]  But anyways, they're trying to push the last point here.
[280.14s -> 282.70s]  Coming back to get some health because I don't think we have a medic on the team.
[282.70s -> 285.50s]  So I have to go back to this dispenser every time.
[285.50s -> 288.06s]  I peek around the corner, I get the timing right.
[288.06s -> 290.67s]  I get that soldier with a nice shot.
[290.67s -> 292.51s]  So just filling up my health.
[292.51s -> 294.11s]  Gonna turn this corner in a second here.
[294.11s -> 295.95s]  And I thought this scout was a spy.
[295.95s -> 298.11s]  I thought he was running slower than he really was.
[298.11s -> 299.87s]  But that's Pwanda.
[299.87s -> 302.43s]  And Pwanda, you made it into a gameplay.
[302.43s -> 303.71s]  You were asking me about this.
[303.71s -> 306.51s]  If you ever made it into a gameplay, if you were ever gonna be in one.
[306.51s -> 307.63s]  There you are.
[307.63s -> 311.07s]  So congratulations, Pwanda, you're in a gameplay.
[311.07s -> 312.37s]  Sick.
[312.37s -> 317.25s]  So anyways, I don't wanna go that way because I figured there was just too many people there.
[317.25s -> 319.81s]  So I'm gonna try and pick somebody off coming around this corner.
[319.81s -> 323.17s]  Or somebody that just is not paying attention and not looking into this room.
[323.17s -> 324.69s]  Just blind firing right now.
[325.25s -> 327.33s]  Trying to get somebody off guard.
[327.33s -> 330.69s]  I get this heavy but I don't headshot him so he doesn't die.
[330.69s -> 332.53s]  Even if I did headshot him, he was overhealed.
[332.53s -> 334.21s]  It probably wouldn't have killed him.
[334.21s -> 335.41s]  So I get this demo man.
[335.41s -> 338.78s]  He comes around the corner here and I boo right in his face.
[338.78s -> 340.70s]  And now I get a little greedy.
[340.70s -> 344.78s]  I'm trying a little too hard to get down into this little corridor.
[344.78s -> 346.62s]  Probably should have just stayed where I was.
[346.62s -> 348.78s]  But you know me, I'm an idiot.
[348.78s -> 350.46s]  So I end up hitting this demo man once.
[350.46s -> 352.46s]  But it's a body shot, no headshot.
[352.46s -> 355.18s]  This Pyro comes for me with Herp Derp Mega Man.
[355.18s -> 356.22s]  And I just get murdered.
[356.22s -> 358.70s]  And that's the one life as the sniper.
[358.70s -> 360.62s]  That is the end of the video, guys.
[360.62s -> 361.82s]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[361.82s -> 365.17s]  Like I said, this is just a small experiment I'm trying.
[365.17s -> 366.29s]  Try to change it up a little.
[366.29s -> 367.97s]  Try to give you guys new things.
[367.97s -> 369.41s]  If you liked it, please let me know.
[369.41s -> 371.17s]  I love to hear from you guys.
[371.17s -> 374.61s]  And by the way, thank you for over a thousand subscribers.
[374.61s -> 377.89s]  Never in my wildest dreams, guys, did I ever think that I would have
[377.89s -> 381.33s]  over a thousand people care about what I had to say.
[381.33s -> 382.85s]  So thank you so much.
[382.85s -> 384.05s]  See you soon.
[384.05s -> 384.61s]  Take care.
