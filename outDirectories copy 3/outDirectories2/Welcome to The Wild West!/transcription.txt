[0.31s -> 13.21s]  You know, before we play a game like this, I think it's safe to say I should take a little swig of whiskey.
[13.21s -> 18.73s]  This is free-for-all? Is that how this works?
[18.73s -> 23.59s]  Oh, you use a kick too? I think it's just free-for-all.
[26.59s -> 29.59s]  Dude, I just blew that guy's head open.
[29.59s -> 33.15s]  Wanna go? Wanna go a shit-shooter, McGee?
[33.15s -> 35.15s]  This guy over here. Don't worry, don't worry.
[35.15s -> 37.15s]  Oh! Bang! Shit!
[37.15s -> 41.99s]  Oh, I got fists. I got a knife too, right?
[41.99s -> 46.00s]  Yeah, I got a knife. Oh, you can throw knives!
[46.00s -> 50.27s]  There's an explosion over here.
[50.27s -> 52.58s]  Shit! I'm gonna get...
[52.58s -> 56.22s]  What? Oh, he's still alive!
[56.22s -> 58.78s]  Not anymore!
[58.78s -> 61.78s]  Oh, dude, you can have two things at the same time?
[61.78s -> 63.78s]  This is just like the old West!
[63.78s -> 66.28s]  Where is somebody? I need to kill someone.
[66.28s -> 70.55s]  Come here, you bastard!
[70.55s -> 73.18s]  Wee-hoo! Wee-hoo!
[73.18s -> 75.18s]  Somebody behind me, right?
[75.18s -> 79.00s]  Uh, don't kill me.
[79.00s -> 84.16s]  This one has six shots? Yeah, six shooter.
[84.16s -> 90.56s]  Somebody behind me too! Shit! No!
[90.56s -> 92.56s]  Oh! Oh!
[92.56s -> 95.06s]  Oh!
[95.06s -> 99.62s]  That was a pretty good arcing knife throw.
[99.62s -> 103.43s]  That's fun. That's cool. I really like that.
[103.43s -> 107.72s]  That's a really cool feature.
[107.72s -> 112.37s]  Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Don't block me, bro!
[112.37s -> 115.06s]  Where is he? Where are you? Where'd you go?
[115.06s -> 121.14s]  Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Let me out of here!
[121.14s -> 123.14s]  I'm gonna throw this and turn around and just blast this dude.
[123.14s -> 126.14s]  Come on! Yes! Nice.
[126.14s -> 129.06s]  Gotta keep the streak going. Gotta keep the streak going.
[129.06s -> 132.20s]  It's all about those streaks.
[132.20s -> 134.44s]  Guys on my team. That guy ain't.
[134.44s -> 136.81s]  Whatever. Screw this.
[136.81s -> 138.81s]  Death from above. You don't even know him right here.
[138.81s -> 141.81s]  You have no idea. You have no clue what's about to happen to you.
[141.81s -> 148.77s]  Yeah, you did. It's a team deathmatch, right?
[148.77s -> 150.77s]  Yeah, I'm on your team.
[150.77s -> 152.77s]  Don't go to shoot. Don't shoot. Hold your fire.
[152.77s -> 157.57s]  There you go. Nice teamwork. Nice teamwork.
[157.57s -> 159.57s]  We got another bastard coming in here.
[159.57s -> 163.09s]  I only got two shots left.
[163.09s -> 165.09s]  I didn't get him.
[165.09s -> 167.09s]  And now I got a long ass reload here.
[167.09s -> 169.09s]  Good save.
[169.09s -> 171.78s]  Good save, dude.
[171.78s -> 173.78s]  It didn't even matter. It was for nothing.
[173.78s -> 179.22s]  So I heard you wanted to fuck with the guy with dynamite in his hand.
[179.22s -> 182.22s]  Is that true?
[182.22s -> 185.23s]  You gotta be kidding me. I did not really mean to do that.
[185.23s -> 187.23s]  You can hold it for a long time.
[187.23s -> 189.66s]  I can hold this for a long time.
[189.66s -> 191.66s]  Come on. Walk down these stairs.
[191.66s -> 197.54s]  Yes!
[197.54s -> 204.56s]  Yes!
[204.56s -> 206.56s]  I can hold this dynamite for a long ass time.
[206.56s -> 210.59s]  Oh, that's a doof-er.
[210.59s -> 212.59s]  That's a doof-er.
[212.59s -> 215.22s]  Special. $2.99.
[215.22s -> 219.50s]  See you in the checkout lane.
[219.50s -> 221.50s]  Never turn your back on a spy.
[221.50s -> 226.35s]  We're gonna go for a Hail Mary here.
[226.35s -> 228.35s]  I'm gonna try just to destroy this guy when he comes through.
[228.35s -> 234.16s]  Hail Mary!
[234.16s -> 237.23s]  Got him. You like that Hail Mary?
[237.23s -> 240.24s]  That knife throw is one of the funnest things. I love it.
[240.24s -> 243.18s]  Damn.
[243.18s -> 246.32s]  Crouch. He can't hit you.
[246.32s -> 250.22s]  That guy's on my team. Why is he shooting me?
[250.22s -> 253.81s]  I don't think I have any more knives left.
[253.81s -> 255.81s]  This single shot shooter thing is awesome.
[255.81s -> 260.14s]  This game's pretty fun.
[260.14s -> 263.02s]  This trajectory is very odd.
[263.02s -> 269.02s]  Come on up the stairs.
[269.02s -> 271.02s]  Where is he? Yeah, up there.
[271.02s -> 273.02s]  Watch your head. You're a little too tall for this ride.
[273.02s -> 275.33s]  I took his hat flew off.
[275.33s -> 278.78s]  Did you see that?
[278.78s -> 280.78s]  This thing goes so fast.
[280.78s -> 282.78s]  It is such a fast moving projectile.
[282.78s -> 286.75s]  It's crazy.
[286.75s -> 288.75s]  Bites going on. I can hear dynamite.
[288.75s -> 292.19s]  I can hear all kinds of stuff.
[292.19s -> 294.37s]  That was too unkillable. Good.
[294.37s -> 296.37s]  Dynamite! Jesus!
[296.37s -> 299.70s]  This hatchet is scary business, man.
[299.70s -> 302.70s]  Nobody even understands.
[302.70s -> 304.88s]  The hatchet wielder is coming.
[309.50s -> 312.00s]  What? Okay.
[312.00s -> 314.00s]  He's dead. It's alright. We're good.
[314.00s -> 316.18s]  I hit him in the nuts.
[316.18s -> 318.18s]  I hit that guy right in the balls with the hatchet.
[318.18s -> 321.57s]  And I don't have a weapon now. I gotta go recover that.
[321.57s -> 325.66s]  Kick his side right through the fucking window.
[325.66s -> 330.66s]  I'll take his weapon.
[330.66s -> 333.47s]  I wanna get a little minigun.
[333.47s -> 336.86s]  I want to use my little cute guns.
[336.86s -> 338.86s]  I feel like I have two little toys in my hand.
[338.86s -> 341.42s]  I wonder how dangerous they are.
[341.42s -> 344.05s]  I wonder if they shoot BBs.
[344.05s -> 346.42s]  I'm gonna shoot you with my little BB gun.
[346.42s -> 349.30s]  Where is anybody? They're pretty dangerous.
[349.30s -> 352.37s]  That's pretty dangerous.
[352.37s -> 354.37s]  This guy's in a lot of trouble now.
[354.37s -> 356.67s]  That's how you hatchet.
[356.67s -> 358.67s]  That's how you horror movie somebody.
[358.67s -> 361.30s]  Can we horror movie anybody else?
[361.30s -> 364.29s]  Yeah, this guy.
[364.29s -> 366.46s]  Get horror movie'd. We both have the exact same idea.
[366.46s -> 368.46s]  He's gonna get his and I'm gonna get mine.
[368.46s -> 370.46s]  We're gonna do it all over again.
[370.46s -> 373.15s]  Shit.
[373.15s -> 375.15s]  No. Please.
[375.15s -> 377.15s]  I just wanna play the horror movie game.
[377.15s -> 380.22s]  That's the end of the movie.
[380.22s -> 382.22s]  Horror movie villain died.
[382.22s -> 384.22s]  Movie's over.
