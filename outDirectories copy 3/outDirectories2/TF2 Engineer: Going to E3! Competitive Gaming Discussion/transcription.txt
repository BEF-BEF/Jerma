[0.31s -> 15.84s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[15.84s -> 23.07s]  and tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer, Aggressive Defense Engineer, playing on the
[23.07s -> 27.23s]  big coil on Thunder Mountain, or the big snake, whatever you want to call it. It's, I think,
[27.23s -> 32.29s]  the last part of Thunder Mountain. But anyways, this video is not gonna really cover any of
[32.29s -> 38.65s]  the gameplay on the screen, but it is gonna cover a gaming topic, and that is competitive.
[38.65s -> 43.93s]  And what it now means to me, and how I feel about the competitive communities across the
[43.93s -> 48.57s]  globe doesn't matter what game you're playing. Because, as you know, some of you, most of
[48.57s -> 53.60s]  you, a lot of you know by now, we are going to E3. Now, if you haven't been on the channel
[53.60s -> 56.40s]  for a few days, or you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll try and break it down
[56.40s -> 61.30s]  a little bit here. So a few days ago, me, Ster, and MLC Stealth, we joined into this
[61.30s -> 66.12s]  Shoot Mania Storm tournament on Twitch TV. And the two people that were the top two
[66.12s -> 72.04s]  in that tournament move on to E3 to play in the Grand Finals. And we're one of those
[72.04s -> 76.73s]  teams. I don't know how we did it. I don't know, it really, it still hasn't hit me yet.
[76.73s -> 81.13s]  I'm still kind of sitting in this chair going, am I really about to get on a plane in like
[81.13s -> 85.73s]  less than 24 hours to go to E3? Is this really happening? My mind has not settled around
[85.73s -> 89.73s]  that fact yet. And I know it will. When I get on that plane, I'm gonna be sitting there,
[89.73s -> 93.73s]  the captain's gonna go, this is your captain speaking. We are now taking off to Los Angeles
[93.73s -> 97.81s]  International Airport. And I'm just gonna be like, oh my God, I'm going to E3. And I'm
[97.81s -> 101.85s]  gonna scare the ever living crap out of everybody on the plane. And that's not my intention.
[101.85s -> 107.12s]  I apologize if you're on that plane that I'm on, but I'm getting off track. The point is
[107.12s -> 111.40s]  we are going there to E3. We're all gonna be there. We're all gonna hang out. Shibby's
[111.40s -> 116.32s]  gonna be there or we're all gonna just, it's gonna be ridiculous. And I'm bringing my camera.
[116.32s -> 121.73s]  Don't worry, I am gonna get random footage of us being crazy in those hotel rooms. But
[121.73s -> 127.05s]  I do have to say this though. This is a massive thank you, massive shout out to anybody that
[127.05s -> 130.81s]  came to that stream that was supporting our team. Because we would look at that chat and
[130.81s -> 134.89s]  we would see people going, yeah, YouTube, money, crush them, let's go. And there were
[134.89s -> 140.05s]  so many of them. It was just so motivating. Whether you came from Shibby, Star, MLC Stealth,
[140.05s -> 145.21s]  my channel, wherever you came from. Thank you so much for doing that. You guys rock.
[145.21s -> 151.58s]  Well, freaking yeah. So now I want to transition from that to talk about competitive gaming
[151.58s -> 155.82s]  and sort of what I think about it and how I feel now, especially now after winning or
[155.82s -> 160.20s]  not winning, but coming in the top two of this tournament to go to E3. So competitive
[160.20s -> 164.08s]  gaming, the only thing, the only experience I've ever had with comp gaming is when I was
[164.08s -> 171.59s]  11, when I was 11 years old, I won a gaming competition at my local Blockbuster. Now that
[171.59s -> 176.47s]  might not sound like competitive gaming, but it was for me when I was 11, I was like, oh
[176.47s -> 180.67s]  my God, I'm playing, I'm going to be in a tournament. And it was exciting. But so the
[180.67s -> 185.35s]  winner of that tournament got to get free rentals from Blockbuster. I think for a couple
[185.35s -> 189.11s]  months or something like that, you get free video game rentals. That's back when video
[189.11s -> 194.72s]  game rentals were the big thing. And that's also back when Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis
[194.72s -> 201.36s]  were the big guys on the block. And now I feel old. Talking about Super Nintendo, I
[201.36s -> 205.88s]  owned a regular Nintendo and an Atari. That's how old I am. I'm pretty much as old as a
[205.88s -> 212.84s]  dinosaur egg. Well, not really. But that is the only time up until this past weekend
[212.84s -> 219.47s]  where I've ever competed in a game situation for real prizes or real notoriety. And I think
[219.47s -> 224.83s]  I want to keep doing it because it was so much fun, guys. This last weekend, it was
[224.83s -> 230.31s]  really tough. It was really competitive. It was really adrenaline rushing. And we spent
[230.31s -> 234.07s]  a lot of time practicing. We were prepared for this tournament. And even still, there
[234.07s -> 238.15s]  were a lot of good teams. And when you go up against a team that's evenly matched with
[238.15s -> 242.44s]  you, calling out strategies and trying to get in position, trying to really land down
[242.44s -> 248.16s]  those shots, my mind was in a tornado. And it wasn't a bad thing. It was a good thing.
[248.16s -> 252.18s]  And it really got me into the game. And I want to keep doing it. It was a rush. I can't
[252.18s -> 257.03s]  explain that a lot of you guys that play competitive probably already know what I'm talking about.
[257.03s -> 261.41s]  We were going up against some quake pros. We were going up against Counter-Strike 1.6
[262.29s -> 266.73s]  A couple other guys that had a lot of competitive experience. And it was just so exciting. And
[266.73s -> 273.36s]  my question for the video, I guess, is competitive-wise, how many of you guys have done some tournaments
[273.36s -> 277.36s]  or maybe won a couple things? And that doesn't mean Team Fortress. I'm talking anything.
[277.36s -> 282.32s]  I'm talking Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Quake, Unreal. A lot of you guys are older
[282.32s -> 286.37s]  too, so you might have some of that experience under your belt as well. And I guess a follow-up
[286.37s -> 293.26s]  question is, getting into competitive, how do you get prepared? Because how I got prepared
[293.26s -> 297.74s]  is I drank like four coffees and listened to a bunch of music in my headphones as loud
[297.74s -> 301.86s]  as it can go to try and get me squared away. And then we just started playing. So I want
[301.86s -> 305.66s]  to know what your guys' process is, because this is really interesting stuff. And it's
[305.66s -> 311.42s]  stuff I like to know. So before this video is over, I want to bring this up again. Thank
[311.42s -> 317.14s]  you so much to everybody that came and supported that stream and came and supported us playing
[317.14s -> 323.14s]  in that tournament. And also a lot of stuff went in behind the scenes with Shibby2142
[323.14s -> 328.70s]  kind of being our PR guy to get our team straightened away, and Incredible Orb. Without Incredible
[328.70s -> 333.28s]  Orb, I would not have been in this tournament. Neither would anybody. So big, huge shout
[333.28s -> 337.24s]  out to Orb. You the man, dude. And I hope to see you at E3. I'm going to give you a
[337.24s -> 343.39s]  big hug. So thank you guys so much for watching video-wise for this channel in the next four
[343.39s -> 346.87s]  or five days. I'm going to have stuff schedule uploaded, so don't worry. There's going to
[346.87s -> 351.17s]  be content here, regardless of me being at E3. And if any of you guys are in the Los
[351.17s -> 357.50s]  Angeles area at the E3 Expo, I will salute you, and hopefully I see you there. So I'll
[357.50s -> 360.94s]  see you guys all soon, and take care, everybody.
