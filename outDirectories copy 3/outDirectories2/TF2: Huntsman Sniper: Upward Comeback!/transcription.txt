[0.31s -> 13.94s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[13.94s -> 18.58s]  and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Huntsman Sniper with the Huntsman, the Crush
[18.58s -> 24.90s]  the Spy in the Face Baby, the Huntsman, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Bushwhacka.
[24.90s -> 29.82s]  Now I take the Bushwhacka off because honestly it's there for no reason. Pretty sure I swap
[29.82s -> 35.02s]  it out with the default Kukri in a minute here after my second or third death. And speaking
[35.02s -> 40.44s]  of deaths, this gameplay is crazy. Take a look at the number right now on the top of
[40.44s -> 44.60s]  the screen. After, of course, you take a look at me shooting that scout right in his teeth
[44.60s -> 50.04s]  with an arrow, but there's a minute and 25 seconds left. I was in a Skype call. Me, Boo,
[50.04s -> 54.52s]  and Stealth were all in a Skype call. We were just raging at each other this whole time.
[54.52s -> 58.84s]  You don't even understand. They had us spawn camped the entire time. And the round before
[58.84s -> 63.76s]  this, they were absolutely rolling us and dominating us. So we were just in the Skype
[63.76s -> 68.80s]  call going, like, this is bullshit. I'm so, oh, this is ridiculous. Oh, Spy, look out
[68.80s -> 75.16s]  for the, and it was just crazy. And then watch what happens here. The mood in the Skype call
[75.16s -> 81.40s]  went from, oh my God, we're going to hang ourselves depressed to the most joyous, amazing
[81.40s -> 86.98s]  occasion. Like, really? Because we've all been in this situation before. I know I don't
[86.98s -> 91.10s]  speak for myself. When you get on Team Fortress 2, you want to play, you want to have fun
[91.10s -> 95.42s]  with your friends, and every single round you get into, you happen to get on the team
[95.42s -> 100.91s]  that is the unbalanced team, and you lose every single match. That is exactly what was
[100.91s -> 105.67s]  happening to us in this string of games we played. I think we did maybe three or four
[105.67s -> 110.33s]  in a row where we were on the unbalanced team and we got rolled within two minutes of the
[110.33s -> 115.28s]  game starting. Also, right there, does that happen to anybody else? My mouse, my optical
[115.28s -> 119.34s]  mouse will sometimes just freak out and just move around in random directions. I want to
[119.34s -> 123.54s]  know if anybody else has that problem. But take a look at what just happened over time
[123.54s -> 129.14s]  right now. Getting on the cart as the Huntsman sniper, I got a heavy with me now. We actually
[129.14s -> 137.08s]  capped this point. And from here on out, it is a total roll. We absolutely destroy them
[137.08s -> 141.89s]  in a way that I can't even really comprehend. And I think I die only one more time after
[141.89s -> 146.99s]  this right here. And it really was just crazy. Nobody really expected this to happen. We
[146.99s -> 151.91s]  were in the Skype call, like I said, just in shock. I kept on landing these shots, you'll
[151.91s -> 157.27s]  see I get some really, really amazing Huntsman shots coming up here. And we were just stunned.
[157.27s -> 161.83s]  It's like, wait, wait, wait, this team was just totally dominating us. They were destroying
[161.83s -> 166.70s]  us the whole time. What just happened? Why are we winning now? I guess it's just the
[166.70s -> 172.58s]  nature of the Team Fortress 2 beast in parentheses quotations right there or whatever you want
[172.58s -> 177.74s]  to call them. I think because this game is just so ridiculous, there's so many variables,
[177.74s -> 183.70s]  anything can happen. So as you saw with one second to go being spawn camp the whole time,
[183.70s -> 189.40s]  we managed to still cap the point and we're still going. I believe this is the only time
[189.40s -> 195.30s]  the cart stands still for more than one second without moving. After we get it through the
[195.30s -> 201.84s]  middle of this tunnel here, the next time it stops is at the last point. And while I
[201.84s -> 207.20s]  have a minute or so here while we roll the cart, I want to talk about an update for you
[207.20s -> 212.88s]  guys on the model search, the search for a CGI model maker or something, however you
[212.88s -> 217.56s]  want to phrase it. But before I get into any of that, I want to say thank you so much to
[217.56s -> 221.96s]  all of you guys. Everybody that sent me a PM or that sent me a comment telling me a
[221.96s -> 227.34s]  certain modeler or even if you offered up to do the service yourself, I really appreciate it
[227.34s -> 232.26s]  guys. I got a great response. Thank you all so, so, so much. But I think I've narrowed it down
[232.26s -> 237.44s]  now. I think I've got the guy I'm going to try and contact. Hopefully I can make some kind of
[237.44s -> 241.96s]  arrangement with this person because I don't want it to be like, oh, hey you, yeah, hey, go do a
[241.96s -> 247.08s]  bunch of work for me. Like I wanted to benefit them as much as it would benefit me as well.
[247.72s -> 253.88s]  So just wanted to make the update that I no longer need any modeler names or any community names
[253.88s -> 258.52s]  or anything like that because I think I got the guy. But thank you everybody regardless, like I
[258.52s -> 265.06s]  said, if I ever need anybody in the future, I will definitely make another video asking for it.
[265.06s -> 270.10s]  So let's talk about the gameplay again here. Look at this pyro. This pyro was so laggy I couldn't
[270.10s -> 276.02s]  even hit him point blank. The amount of lag that was being generated from that guy's bloodstream
[276.02s -> 279.62s]  was off the charts. And look at that guy. You see that guy fall off the edge?
[281.14s -> 286.10s]  I always love when that happens. And let's talk about upward now. Speaking of like falling off
[286.10s -> 291.82s]  the edges and upward being a crazy map, this is a pretty difficult map to get a gameplay on.
[291.82s -> 297.66s]  As you've probably noticed by now, there's only maybe two or three upward gameplays, including
[297.66s -> 304.30s]  this one on my channel. And that's really just because it's so long. If you do not roll on upward
[304.30s -> 309.98s]  or even bad water, to be honest, if you don't absolutely can lootly roll the other team,
[309.98s -> 314.78s]  or when you're on defense, if you don't defend the point really well, you're going to end up
[314.78s -> 321.34s]  with like a 45 minute round. And this happens quite frequently. I spend at least 20 minutes,
[321.34s -> 327.26s]  25 minutes at least in most of my bad water or upward rounds. So it can be quite tricky
[327.26s -> 331.26s]  sometimes to get an actual gameplay that is watchable. Because like you guys know,
[331.26s -> 338.14s]  I don't like uploading like 27 minute long videos only because it kills my internet and my computer
[338.14s -> 343.98s]  will just explode if I try and render out like a 30 minute video. I did that one time before,
[343.98s -> 350.46s]  and it was for a Q&A video and my computer like exploded. So I don't want to do that again.
[350.46s -> 354.86s]  So coming up to the end of the gameplay here, a demo man takes out the sentry that's at the top
[354.86s -> 359.74s]  left. I get critscrigged for I think one second and I end up getting a critscrigged kill with
[359.74s -> 364.97s]  the huntsman. And it was just pure luck. One second he had it on me and I got the kill with it.
[364.97s -> 370.41s]  And I still can't believe we came back from such a huge deficit. Because I mean, we were down to
[370.41s -> 375.61s]  one second at the first point and less than five or six minutes later we win the game.
[375.61s -> 380.25s]  That is just unbelievable to me. And I give a huge standing ovation to my teammates.
[380.25s -> 385.93s]  We were in Skype saying, Oh my God, this is great. What an awesome comeback. And it really was. So
[385.93s -> 390.17s]  thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I will see you guys all
[390.17s -> 393.37s]  next time. So take care, everybody.
