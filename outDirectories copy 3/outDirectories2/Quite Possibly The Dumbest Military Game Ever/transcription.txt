[0.31s -> 14.66s]  Your mission is to find L. Ushin's hideout and eliminate him and his entire drug cartel.
[14.66s -> 21.40s]  You do this as this guy.
[21.40s -> 25.05s]  This guy doesn't see me?
[25.05s -> 29.48s]  As long as you stay hidden in the bushes, enemies will not be able to see you.
[29.48s -> 33.23s]  Oh look. What the fuck dude? Are you kidding me right now?
[33.23s -> 39.63s]  There's gonna be some guy that's gonna walk over here.
[39.63s -> 42.63s]  Yeah, oh look, oh I wonder why I can't believe that.
[42.63s -> 44.63s]  Where's, oh there's somebody in that bush I think.
[44.63s -> 47.63s]  Oh no, I'll just take my 2D gun and go yeah.
[47.63s -> 52.64s]  Whoa whoa whoa, press enter at the right place to, oh I have to blow the bridge up.
[52.64s -> 55.89s]  Okay, this looks like, hmm.
[55.89s -> 58.89s]  I wonder where the right place is.
[58.89s -> 61.89s]  It's not a giant blue arrow.
[64.82s -> 67.82s]  Make sure you find the right place, indicated by the gi-
[67.82s -> 78.19s]  What? Did that seriously blow me up?
[78.19s -> 82.62s]  It was a cutscene! That was just a cutscene!
[82.62s -> 85.62s]  Three, two, one, boom!
[85.62s -> 90.10s]  What was that?
[90.10s -> 92.10s]  What was just on the side of the screen?
[92.10s -> 95.66s]  What was that giant clay brick that just came over?
[95.66s -> 98.66s]  What the fuck was that?
[98.66s -> 104.42s]  Why would they have an explosion animation if you were just gonna take it out with a slab of clay?
[104.42s -> 113.14s]  Why is this a lumberyard? Why are we at a lumberyard?
[113.14s -> 116.78s]  Dude, dude.
[116.78s -> 120.78s]  No dude, like, you've got to be kidding me right now.
[120.78s -> 127.17s]  You've shot down dozens of gang members, but you still aren't a single step closer to their leader.
[127.17s -> 132.56s]  To make him come after you in person, try to make things more personal.
[132.56s -> 136.38s]  That's a pretty nice car, dude.
[136.38s -> 139.38s]  This is his recently imported from France super sports car.
[139.38s -> 144.26s]  Trash it with your baseball bat before he returns.
[145.26s -> 149.26s]  Excuse me, but are you making this up right now, or am I hearing you correctly?
[149.26s -> 151.26s]  No, this is, I'm not making this up.
[151.26s -> 155.42s]  Attack it.
[156.42s -> 158.42s]  Yeah, you show him.
[158.42s -> 161.42s]  You show him what it's like to be a gang member.
[163.42s -> 170.45s]  Mission failed? I fucking trashed the thing.
[170.45s -> 173.45s]  Dude, I trashed the car.
[173.45s -> 176.45s]  Oh, you better hurry up and do it.
[177.45s -> 180.45s]  How much more damage do you want me to do to this car?
[180.45s -> 185.45s]  The car was like in a fucking junkyard by the time I was done with it.
[185.45s -> 187.45s]  If I fail the mission right now...
[187.45s -> 189.45s]  What is this?
[190.45s -> 192.69s]  What happened to the enemies?
[192.69s -> 194.69s]  What's going on?
[194.69s -> 196.69s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
[196.69s -> 199.31s]  Oh, it's an armored car.
[200.31s -> 206.38s]  Well, you didn't really take the right correct route to come get me.
[206.38s -> 209.94s]  You actually just drove into a tree.
[209.94s -> 212.76s]  Jesus, dude!
[215.60s -> 224.15s]  So what happens when these all get actually exploded?
[224.15s -> 225.71s]  What happens?
[225.71s -> 227.71s]  Oh, there's another one. Look out. Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[227.71s -> 228.71s]  I'm an animal.
[228.71s -> 234.23s]  The cars in this game are animals and they just drive into walls.
[234.23s -> 235.23s]  All right, I did it.
[235.23s -> 236.23s]  What's next?
[236.23s -> 238.05s]  What's next, huh?
[238.05s -> 239.05s]  What do you got for me?
[239.05s -> 240.86s]  What do you got for me?
[240.86s -> 241.86s]  I hear you.
[241.86s -> 242.86s]  I hear you.
[242.86s -> 243.86s]  Where are you?
[252.51s -> 258.94s]  First car. Where's the first car?
[258.94s -> 259.94s]  First car. Where are you at?
[259.94s -> 261.94s]  There you are, driving into walls.
[261.94s -> 264.50s]  You ain't even going to make it over here.
[264.50s -> 265.50s]  Your pathing is so...
[270.58s -> 272.52s]  Bye.
[272.52s -> 273.52s]  Goodbye.
[273.52s -> 276.98s]  Sometimes you find a bug in a game.
[276.98s -> 282.52s]  And sometimes you just interdimensional time warp through every single map that they made.
[282.52s -> 284.52s]  I have no idea why this is happening.
[284.52s -> 285.52s]  We've landed.
[285.52s -> 287.52s]  We're on Jupiter now. Welcome to Jupiter.
[287.52s -> 288.52s]  Enjoy your stay.
[288.52s -> 290.52s]  Please pick up your bags at the carousel.
[290.52s -> 297.26s]  What the fuck is actually going on right now?
[297.26s -> 299.26s]  This just turned into a completely different game.
[299.26s -> 302.58s]  I feel like I'm soul searching right now.
[302.58s -> 304.78s]  Look at this.
[304.78s -> 306.78s]  What happens if I go into like the great void?
[306.78s -> 309.91s]  The great void awaits you.
[309.91s -> 313.90s]  What's this?
[313.90s -> 314.90s]  A new land.
