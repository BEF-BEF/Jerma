[0.31s -> 13.82s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Excel for Microsoft Windows.
[13.82s -> 18.82s]  It's a gameplay commentary. As you can see, the background is going to be me using Microsoft Excel,
[18.82s -> 22.82s]  which is probably one of the best releases gaming-wise this year.
[22.82s -> 25.82s]  And yes, I gotta get this out of the way. Yes, this is a paid upload.
[25.82s -> 31.82s]  I was paid $27,000 to make this video from Microsoft from actually the CEO Bill Gates.
[31.82s -> 36.00s]  He handed me actually two briefcases full of $100 bills,
[36.00s -> 41.00s]  and they all were kissed individually by Bill Gates, so I take it as you want it.
[41.00s -> 45.00s]  But anyways, we're going to talk about Microsoft Excel again. This is the best game to come out this year.
[45.00s -> 49.00s]  And now we're going to drop this little facade and talk about why I'm bringing this up.
[49.00s -> 52.82s]  First of all, let's transition to some actual gameplay here. We're going to transition to...
[52.82s -> 56.82s]  I don't know what it is. It's going to be some random game. It could be TF2. It could be SMITE.
[56.82s -> 59.82s]  I don't know what the gameplay is, but I do need to bring this up,
[59.82s -> 68.82s]  because it seems like every time I upload a video that's not TF2 or that's not like a big AAA title,
[68.82s -> 70.82s]  there's always at least a few people that ask me,
[70.82s -> 73.82s]  did you get paid to upload this video?
[73.82s -> 80.12s]  And some people get quite upset over this notion that there could be a video on this channel that somebody paid me for,
[80.12s -> 87.12s]  or any YouTuber, that you got paid to play a game or to talk about a certain game or to upload a certain game.
[87.12s -> 93.73s]  And to firstly bring this up to start off talking about this, I have never been paid to play a game.
[93.73s -> 99.73s]  That's never happened. All the videos on this channel are games that I really enjoy playing,
[99.73s -> 103.73s]  that I've spent a lot of time with, that I actually enjoy the experiences of.
[103.73s -> 109.73s]  You're never going to see an upload on this channel of a game that I didn't generally enjoy.
[109.73s -> 112.73s]  A game that I didn't... Or let's rephrase that a little bit.
[112.73s -> 116.90s]  But games that just came out can fit in this category too.
[116.90s -> 120.90s]  Like if a game just released, I'm doing a review or a breakdown or first impressions.
[120.90s -> 125.90s]  That's the same thing. So I would say those are the two categories of video content on this channel.
[125.90s -> 131.90s]  If it's not a skit, if it's not me doing a vlog or just kind of like a general podcast type video where I bring up a topic.
[131.90s -> 136.90s]  The gameplay on this channel will always fit into one of those categories.
[136.90s -> 138.90s]  I'm never going to just accept from Satan.
[138.90s -> 142.08s]  He comes up to me with a contract and he says,
[142.08s -> 150.38s]  Jeremy, I want you to sign on the dotted line. I'm going to pay you $5,000 for you to upload my shitty game.
[153.38s -> 158.38s]  That's not going to happen. The only time I've declined, guys, this is what a lot of people don't realize,
[158.38s -> 161.38s]  and a lot of YouTubers can vouch for this as well.
[161.38s -> 166.38s]  I've declined a lot of offers from people that I just didn't see as making sense to put on my channel.
[166.38s -> 170.62s]  The notion of paid videos irks me. It really does.
[170.62s -> 178.62s]  It really kind of gets under my skin unless it's something that I'm already a big fan of or something that I'm really excited for.
[178.62s -> 187.18s]  But the flip side of the coin here, an argument for something like a paid video or a paid playtime or a stream or something like that,
[187.18s -> 190.18s]  is a lot of YouTubers do this for a living.
[190.18s -> 193.18s]  A lot of guys wake up in the morning, myself included.
[193.18s -> 196.18s]  We get up in the morning, we come up with these ideas, we try to make new content.
[196.18s -> 202.42s]  We're always trying to innovate on things, make better videos, try to make the highest quality videos we possibly can.
[202.42s -> 207.42s]  And maybe it is okay for somebody to take a couple of paid videos because it's just more money in their pocket,
[207.42s -> 212.42s]  more money they can use to spend on improving the channel, buying more games, buying more stuff.
[212.42s -> 219.42s]  Now, I'm not saying that all these deals should be done because there are some of these deals that are just, let's just face it, downright stupid.
[219.42s -> 224.42s]  Like really, really stupid, and they are completely meaningless videos, completely meaningless things.
[224.42s -> 226.42s]  But there are some things that are worthwhile.
[226.42s -> 234.42s]  And the reason why I started this video out as the Microsoft Excel type thing is because that's the type of thing that I see as stupid, I see as dumb.
[234.42s -> 240.42s]  But if it's an actual gaming video and it's something that the person, the YouTuber happens to be involved in,
[240.42s -> 248.42s]  then I find that to be okay, especially because of the state of YouTube right now, how, you know, monetizing views is so difficult at the moment.
[248.42s -> 252.60s]  And it really just comes down to, I guess, channel integrity.
[252.60s -> 255.60s]  Do you want to be known as the guy that has a paid video every two weeks?
[255.60s -> 261.60s]  Or do you want to be known as somebody that is supporting good companies or that's supporting their own channel
[261.60s -> 265.60s]  and not taking every single handout from companies that they ever receive?
[265.60s -> 270.10s]  But I guess this is the part of the video where I open it up to you guys.
[270.10s -> 272.10s]  I want to get a discussion going in the comments.
[272.10s -> 279.10s]  Let me know how you feel about this because, like I said in the beginning, it is a very touchy subject to a lot of people.
[280.10s -> 287.10s]  The notion of even ad revenue on YouTube just by people running ads, it's, you get into a really weird set of waters here
[287.10s -> 294.10s]  because once you bring money really into anything, you can cause a lot of problems and a lot of conflict can arise.
[294.10s -> 299.10s]  And in reality, that happens everywhere, not just on YouTube.
[299.10s -> 302.10s]  You're talking about every business, every friendship.
[302.10s -> 307.10s]  There's so many cases where money can really destroy things.
[307.10s -> 311.27s]  And I want to get your opinions on that, so please let me hear them.
[311.27s -> 314.27s]  Anyways, that's going to wrap up the video, guys, so thank you so much for watching.
[314.27s -> 317.27s]  I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[317.27s -> 319.27s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
