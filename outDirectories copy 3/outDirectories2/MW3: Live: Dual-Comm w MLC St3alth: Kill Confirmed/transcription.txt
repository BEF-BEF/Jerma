[0.31s -> 13.74s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma and MLC Stealth here. Go ahead and say hello.
[13.74s -> 16.74s]  With a Team Force 2 game-ly commentary.
[16.74s -> 20.87s]  That's not what this is. This is Modern Warfare 5th Week.
[20.87s -> 21.87s]  Oh, where is this guy?
[21.87s -> 22.87s]  Much better game.
[22.87s -> 23.87s]  How did I know? What just happened?
[23.87s -> 27.87s]  Oh, this is a live commentary, by the way. If you couldn't already tell, playing with
[27.87s -> 32.87s]  MLC Stealth, he is like the Call of Duty guru. So I'm trying to...
[32.87s -> 36.87s]  This is on the PC where I don't know how to aim or shoot.
[36.87s -> 42.11s]  You're ten times better than I am. So I'm just going to follow you. Or am I?
[42.11s -> 45.54s]  Have fun getting free deaths.
[45.54s -> 49.17s]  Because I'm going to lead you off a cliff.
[49.17s -> 51.54s]  Oh, this guy's screwed.
[51.54s -> 54.54s]  Oh, P90X, get jacked. What?
[54.54s -> 60.72s]  Wait, why am I running Specialist right now? I mean, not Specialist.
[60.72s -> 61.72s]  So you can get the easy MOAB.
[61.72s -> 64.72s]  No, but I'm Support right now. I don't want to be Support.
[64.72s -> 69.72s]  Oh, well. I wanted to have Predator drones drop on people's skulls. Oh, there you are.
[69.72s -> 72.86s]  Predator drones.
[72.86s -> 75.86s]  For those of you that care, I'm using this as the P90 with...
[75.86s -> 82.10s]  I believe it has range and suppressing on it. Suppressor.
[82.10s -> 84.66s]  Where did you go?
[84.66s -> 87.83s]  I took towards the enemies to kill them all.
[87.83s -> 89.83s]  Watch out for that bogey up in that tower.
[89.83s -> 91.39s]  Tango 6.
[91.39s -> 92.39s]  I made that up.
[92.39s -> 94.39s]  Negative zero snipe me.
[94.39s -> 96.39s]  Oh, God. Oh, come on.
[96.39s -> 100.08s]  What? I got like a double kill with a javelin.
[100.08s -> 102.08s]  What just even happened? How did I not kill him?
[102.08s -> 106.96s]  He didn't even hit me. He like went through me like a damn ghost.
[106.96s -> 111.74s]  So where are you? Oh, God.
[111.74s -> 113.74s]  Everyone just saw how terrible I am.
[113.74s -> 115.74s]  What do you think of Patrick Swayze?
[115.74s -> 119.74s]  I can't believe I didn't kill this guy. I got to see this again.
[119.74s -> 123.74s]  I like unloaded on this guy and he just owned me.
[123.74s -> 127.94s]  So wait, what do I think of who? Patrick Swayze?
[127.94s -> 130.94s]  And Demi Moore. Do you think she was good in Ghost?
[130.94s -> 132.94s]  I don't know. I don't even see that movie.
[132.94s -> 135.94s]  Did you see that movie? Oh, God.
[135.94s -> 138.94s]  This is not turning out well for Jerem.
[138.94s -> 142.69s]  Oh, that guy just got like a triple kill with his akimbo FMGs.
[142.69s -> 146.38s]  He must be really good. That's not going to happen again.
[146.38s -> 147.38s]  He's really good.
[147.38s -> 150.00s]  That's not going to happen again.
[150.00s -> 152.58s]  Tango on the roof.
[152.58s -> 155.58s]  Come on, man. Hit more. How many times do I have to hit somebody before I kill them?
[155.58s -> 158.58s]  Oh, I am using FMG. Never mind.
[158.58s -> 161.91s]  Oh, it's double team. Up top. Up top.
[161.91s -> 163.91s]  Negative zero down. Flashbang now.
[163.91s -> 166.91s]  Oh, my God. That took so long to kill that guy.
[166.91s -> 168.91s]  There's bogeys above us in the roof.
[168.91s -> 170.91s]  Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm scared.
[170.91s -> 172.91s]  No. No.
[172.91s -> 175.73s]  Ah. Do I?
[175.73s -> 176.73s]  How did that guy kill you?
[176.73s -> 179.10s]  I don't know. Be careful.
[179.10s -> 183.30s]  So for those of you wondering if you don't know who Stealth is,
[183.30s -> 186.30s]  Stealth, go ahead and give a little brief synopsis of who you are.
[186.30s -> 188.30s]  Oh, I don't know.
[188.30s -> 190.30s]  I play Call of Duty.
[190.30s -> 192.30s]  Oh, I'm just some guy.
[192.30s -> 196.30s]  I'm five foot ten. My favorite color is a combination of blue and red.
[196.30s -> 198.30s]  Some call that purple.
[198.30s -> 199.30s]  What?
[199.30s -> 202.30s]  I really like Hot Pockets. I think that's a pretty tasty treat.
[202.30s -> 205.30s]  And I sometimes upload Call of Duty because I like this game.
[205.30s -> 211.30s]  AKA, you got like a feast at this game and you get like Moabs every 15 seconds.
[211.30s -> 212.30s]  I don't know.
[212.30s -> 215.30s]  Oh, nice. Switch right there.
[215.30s -> 217.30s]  Yeah, you switched and let him shoot me instead of you.
[217.30s -> 221.30s]  I'm up top. I don't know what you're talking about.
[221.30s -> 224.30s]  Oh, my God. How many times do you have to...
[224.30s -> 227.30s]  Thank you for saving my life right there.
[227.30s -> 230.30s]  You owe me so many things now.
[230.30s -> 232.30s]  I got an advanced UAV. You want it?
[232.30s -> 233.30s]  Should I do it right now?
[233.30s -> 236.30s]  Oh, like now. Do it. Also Stealth Bomber.
[236.30s -> 238.30s]  Get inside the building. Get inside the building.
[238.30s -> 241.30s]  Wait, wait, wait. What? I can't get in.
[241.30s -> 245.30s]  Did you just lie to me? Did that not just even happen?
[245.30s -> 248.05s]  It absolutely just happened.
[248.05s -> 250.05s]  I had some like Chips Ahoy cookies still in my mouth.
[250.05s -> 254.05s]  So, Jerma, who are you? Tell like my people who you are.
[254.05s -> 260.05s]  I'm a crazy dude that tries to shoot people from a thousand miles away with an SMG and doesn't get any luck.
[260.05s -> 266.61s]  No, I'm a... I don't know. I do Team Fortress 2 and all kinds of weird dumb stuff.
[266.61s -> 268.61s]  Pretty much that's who I am.
[268.61s -> 272.10s]  So what do you think about Scientology?
[272.10s -> 275.10s]  I think it's a religion that was created.
[275.10s -> 278.10s]  And that's pretty much all I really know about it.
[278.10s -> 280.10s]  I know Tom Cruise is one.
[280.10s -> 282.10s]  I don't know if that's like... Oh God.
[282.10s -> 284.10s]  He was pretty good on that recent movie.
[284.10s -> 286.10s]  Come on.
[286.10s -> 289.18s]  Oh, don't worry. I'm only 9 and 11.
[289.18s -> 291.18s]  That's a weird combo.
[291.18s -> 297.63s]  Yeah, that's better than like 1 and 11 on the other team.
[297.63s -> 301.00s]  If my math's right, that's slightly better.
[301.00s -> 303.00s]  You know what's tricky though?
[303.00s -> 307.00s]  I have the game volume turned almost all the way down for recording purposes.
[307.00s -> 311.00s]  So I'm just like, dare who? Who's that right in front of me?
[311.00s -> 315.00s]  So that is why you did not hear the demon stealth bomber coming to kill us all.
[315.00s -> 317.00s]  I can't see anything.
[317.00s -> 319.00s]  What just even happened to me?
[319.00s -> 321.30s]  I'm lost and forgotten.
[321.30s -> 323.48s]  You're lost in translation?
[323.48s -> 328.72s]  But yeah, if you're watching this on my channel, his link will be in the description.
[329.72s -> 336.72s]  If you're watching this on my channel, there's going to be a link in my 10 videos ago and you're going to have to search for it.
[336.72s -> 340.41s]  I will not make his link easy to find.
[340.41s -> 342.41s]  Yeah, make sure it's incredibly difficult.
[342.41s -> 344.41s]  Wait, wait, wait. Come back here.
[344.41s -> 346.41s]  You. Turn around.
[346.41s -> 349.41s]  I was just killed by this guy in this room. Get him.
[349.41s -> 351.41s]  Because I can't. I'm too stupid.
[351.41s -> 353.41s]  Oh, behind you. Behind us too.
[353.41s -> 355.41s]  No, I got him. Don't worry.
[356.41s -> 359.41s]  This game scares the absolute crap out of me.
[359.41s -> 361.41s]  It really does. Like this.
[361.41s -> 362.41s]  Did we win?
[362.41s -> 364.41s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[366.41s -> 367.41s]  Well, there we go.
[367.41s -> 369.41s]  Zero quit out.
[369.41s -> 371.41s]  Hey, I went 12 and 12. Oh my God.
[371.41s -> 373.41s]  Campers win again.
[373.41s -> 375.65s]  That's what Phoenix said.
[375.65s -> 378.65s]  Dude, look at that jumping shot to end it. That was pretty awesome.
