[0.31s -> 24.06s]  Shut up! I wasn't even recording. Oh my god, yes I can hear you. Alright, so looks like we figured out that there is...
[24.06s -> 38.19s]  Shut the fuck up! You wanna be my partner? You, me and you, you have no eyes. Alright, so I'm the driver, where are you?
[38.19s -> 46.44s]  I'm tactical interventioning in the back. Is there a different camera view I can use? No.
[46.44s -> 55.79s]  We're gonna find the marijuana plant. Are you actually driving? Cause you haven't crashed yet and I don't know why you haven't done that on purpose.
[55.79s -> 67.02s]  You mean like that? That wasn't a crash. That was, wait, wait, oh. That was terrible.
[67.02s -> 78.66s]  What are these guys? Let me out. Can you get out? No, I can only see trees inside the car. Alright, well, let's see.
[78.66s -> 86.90s]  We're just trying to be like a good Samaritan. Hold on, I need to just check something first.
[86.90s -> 92.14s]  I gotta like make sure that these guys are not breaking the law. Okay.
[92.14s -> 104.11s]  Oh, we have to do this again. We have to do this whole driving sequence for a second time.
[109.27s -> 117.27s]  I'm just sitting in the back seat of this car. Just because I like bumped that guy.
[117.27s -> 133.89s]  Here we go. This is where we still haven't done anything. Did you hear that music build up? Yeah, this music is like really intense.
[133.89s -> 146.53s]  For what? Just to strive to connect the dots in like an old highlights book? To your right, to your right, to your right, dude.
[146.53s -> 158.58s]  Alright, look, it's actually running. I'm dead. I need help. I need Obama. Obama, please. Come on, Obama.
[158.58s -> 163.75s]  Oh, I got you. Yes, sir. I got you, my friend. I wish this is how real life worked.
[163.75s -> 168.06s]  What, being able to revive from somebody putting their hand down at you and grabbing you?
[168.06s -> 174.81s]  Oh, you got like 12 bullet wounds. Let me put my hand down on you. Speaking of hand down, everybody died.
[174.81s -> 183.88s]  I ran so far forward. Obama didn't come to help me. Look, I don't want to have died. Obama came to come help me instead of you.
[183.88s -> 209.85s]  Don't hit the weed, man. It's good shit. Light this place up. Plant bomb. Torch this place to hell. What, do I not remember the code?
[209.85s -> 228.36s]  You know, you do kind of have to get... What? How did I die? Did you really? No, we have to start over again.
[228.36s -> 237.81s]  Back to the car. Oh, wow, that was such a ridiculous mission. I can't wait to see what the next one is.
[237.81s -> 249.71s]  Activate. What am I doing? Concentrator mode. It's slow motion. What? They really have that in this game? Why is that in this game?
[249.71s -> 263.22s]  Is there any reason for that? Yes. What's the reason? Oh, okay. Yeah, that's a good reason. Let's go.
[263.22s -> 272.34s]  I'm leaning out the window for your information. Watch out for that helicopter flying through the forest.
[272.34s -> 288.09s]  That helicopter was literally driving in the forest. Like, how? Do you like that turn? These car physics, man. This is tactical intervention all over again.
[288.09s -> 300.86s]  I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this. What? We were flying. I drove up the ramp of that car.
[300.86s -> 306.86s]  I remember this area in tactical intervention. This bridge. This really is from tactical intervention. It's the same game.
[306.86s -> 318.00s]  I'm out the window. Shoot these guys. I'm doing it. You got to take them out, big. This is tactical intervention.
[318.00s -> 344.64s]  This is this is what we left in mission area. Look at how we're not supposed to go down this road. It's over here.
[344.64s -> 361.87s]  Okay. What? I don't even know where we're supposed to be going. The only thing we have is the connect the dots.
[361.87s -> 372.38s]  Oh, okay. Well, that was interesting. Oh, my God. That was that was worth downloading this game.
[373.38s -> 387.04s]  Oh, I need to I need to call a burger boy and tell him that he can't come over yet because this is getting interesting.
[387.04s -> 399.93s]  What the hell? Hold on. Sorry, dude. Hold on. What the fuck? That was unbelievable. I'm like on the phone and like the phone pops up on the screen.
[399.93s -> 407.50s]  Hey, sorry. I'm talking like three people at the same time. I'm wicked. Sorry, Burger Boy.
[407.50s -> 417.60s]  So do you want to use the third? Don't come like now because I just realized I'm like recording.
[417.60s -> 431.35s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dude. I'll call you in like a half an hour. I'm sorry.
[431.35s -> 446.02s]  All right. Bye. That looks so fucking stupid. It's so weird that this whole time we've played that no phone time.
[446.02s -> 452.46s]  You were on the phone and now we're done with the phone. You hang up now. Burger Boy is like pissed at me.
