[0.31s -> 14.76s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy Mondays.
[14.76s -> 18.76s]  In this episode, we're going to tackle the Salt Factory Chapter 3.
[18.76s -> 23.75s]  So what do you say we get started and watch the cutscene?
[23.75s -> 30.00s]  Alright, so he's got my pig girlfriend. She looks like a pig from behind right there.
[30.00s -> 38.44s]  He turned into the moon, went into the Salt Factory. I love this music.
[38.44s -> 43.06s]  This is like one of my favorite songs in the whole game. I don't know why.
[43.06s -> 49.70s]  Just like that. Here we go.
[49.70s -> 54.06s]  This is where it's going to start to get really, really bad on the rage front.
[54.06s -> 57.06s]  So let's see if I can't just pull this off.
[60.69s -> 63.69s]  Can I get it? Yes.
[67.17s -> 70.17s]  No, I can't. I should have just jumped over it. I'm an idiot.
[70.17s -> 72.66s]  No, screw the Band-Aid. I don't need it.
[74.54s -> 77.81s]  There it is.
[79.81s -> 83.26s]  We go up and down. I don't even remember.
[83.26s -> 87.44s]  It's been a long time since I've played this game. Looks like we're going up.
[91.41s -> 94.74s]  Level complete.
[94.74s -> 97.42s]  I can walk on this, right? Okay, good.
[97.42s -> 100.42s]  I was going to say, hopefully I can walk on this.
[101.42s -> 106.86s]  Jump, jump. Let's go, Super Meat Boy. Show them what you got.
[106.86s -> 112.66s]  You know what? For a second I thought that was in the background.
[112.66s -> 114.66s]  Like the foreground. I couldn't run into it.
[114.66s -> 117.67s]  I thought it was part of the scenery.
[117.67s -> 121.64s]  Now I know. See, now you...
[122.64s -> 127.14s]  Oh my god. I'm shifting in my seat. I've got to get comfortable.
[132.54s -> 138.00s]  Get the key. Nice and easy here.
[138.00s -> 142.56s]  No bologna. No bologna and cheese sandwiches here.
[146.59s -> 150.09s]  Now I know that happens. It's good to know.
[150.09s -> 153.46s]  Run!
[153.46s -> 155.46s]  Oh, jeez, I forgot that happened.
[155.46s -> 159.47s]  See, that's definitely the worst part about playing this over again.
[159.47s -> 161.47s]  Just blindly. I forget all these levels.
[161.47s -> 163.47s]  Now I know that happens so I can...
[168.47s -> 170.47s]  God, the noises that are made.
[170.47s -> 173.47s]  Warp Zone, Warp Zone, Warp Zone. Can I get in there?
[173.47s -> 176.34s]  How the hell do I get in there?
[176.34s -> 178.34s]  Oh, for the love of Pete. Whatever.
[180.15s -> 182.15s]  Hold on. There we go.
[183.52s -> 186.02s]  Oh, no. Hold on.
[187.02s -> 189.38s]  Ninja Meat Boy.
[196.45s -> 200.22s]  20 points to who knows what that is.
[203.17s -> 205.17s]  Oh, let's keep it skiing here.
[205.17s -> 208.17s]  Tribes Ascent. Just like Tribes.
[208.17s -> 210.66s]  It's all about the skiing.
[210.66s -> 212.66s]  Hey, Blush Baby.
[219.66s -> 221.66s]  This is my favorite part. I love this.
[223.66s -> 227.31s]  Yeah.
[227.31s -> 229.31s]  Boomtown. Oh, I forgot. Oh, yeah, these things.
[229.31s -> 231.31s]  You have to kind of dodge these things.
[231.31s -> 235.31s]  They shoot a little slow, but they have homing capabilities.
[235.31s -> 240.74s]  So you want to b-ya-hoo and then you want to b-ya-ha and then you want to b-ya-ha.
[241.74s -> 242.74s]  Otto, what do you want?
[242.74s -> 244.74s]  Otto just walked in my room.
[244.74s -> 245.74s]  Which means my door is open.
[245.74s -> 249.74s]  Which means the other big dog, the big, gross, smelly dog can get in here now.
[249.74s -> 251.74s]  And I don't want that.
[251.74s -> 253.74s]  Not that I don't love my dog, but he's a...
[253.74s -> 256.74s]  He is big and he is gross.
[256.74s -> 259.74s]  Here's a little quick story about that dog.
[259.74s -> 263.74s]  So the big, huge dog you've probably seen in videos past.
[263.74s -> 269.74s]  We have to give him to the groomer every couple months or every few weeks.
[269.74s -> 273.74s]  Because he's just so big and disgusting.
[273.74s -> 275.74s]  He just stinks sometimes.
[275.74s -> 277.98s]  But he's a big, lovable ox. We love him.
[277.98s -> 279.98s]  His name's Boo Boo.
[279.98s -> 283.22s]  Oh my god. That's the fifth time that's happened.
[283.22s -> 285.22s]  Enough. Enough. Enough.
[285.22s -> 287.22s]  My ship sails in the morning.
[287.22s -> 289.22s]  I wonder what's for breakfast.
[293.42s -> 295.82s]  Come on.
[295.82s -> 299.66s]  Dog. God damn it.
[300.66s -> 302.79s]  Come on.
[302.79s -> 307.46s]  You see, they have to explode.
[307.46s -> 310.46s]  If you don't get them to blow up, then you're in big trouble.
[310.46s -> 311.46s]  Like that. See?
[311.46s -> 312.46s]  There was like...
[313.46s -> 315.46s]  Please. God. No.
[316.46s -> 318.90s]  Okay. Time to...
[318.90s -> 320.90s]  I really got to pay attention here.
[320.90s -> 325.08s]  No.
[325.08s -> 329.08s]  Oh my god. I'm going to throw the friggin' controller into the wall.
[329.08s -> 331.02s]  Come on.
[331.02s -> 334.57s]  Alright. Wait for another one.
[334.57s -> 335.57s]  Good.
[335.57s -> 338.57s]  Now. God. In. Heaven.
[338.57s -> 342.30s]  Go.
[342.30s -> 344.67s]  I'm sick of this.
[344.67s -> 348.45s]  There. That's it. You're supposed to turn and run.
[348.45s -> 350.45s]  And then do it again.
[350.45s -> 352.45s]  And then do it again.
[352.45s -> 353.45s]  Thank you very much.
[353.45s -> 355.45s]  Holy crap.
[355.45s -> 357.45s]  Oh no. I didn't want to skip that. Crap.
[357.45s -> 359.45s]  I wanted to see all those deaths.
[359.45s -> 362.45s]  I'm sorry if you wanted to see that too. I apologize.
[362.45s -> 365.20s]  But I have such an itchy trigger finger in this game.
[365.20s -> 367.20s]  I just have to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[370.14s -> 372.22s]  Woohoo.
[372.22s -> 375.80s]  Got to stay in the middle. Got to stay in the middle.
[376.80s -> 378.81s]  A+.
[380.43s -> 381.43s]  Yeah.
[381.43s -> 383.82s]  The bend.
[383.82s -> 385.82s]  Welcome to the bend.
[385.82s -> 389.02s]  Bender bending Rodriguez.
[390.02s -> 392.02s]  Bite my shiny metal ass.
[393.52s -> 395.52s]  Oh no.
[395.52s -> 400.98s]  Me and Fry are going to go do some terrorizing.
[400.98s -> 403.47s]  Come on, Professor.
[403.47s -> 405.47s]  I don't think I'm going to do.
[405.47s -> 407.47s]  Why do all my voices sound the same?
[409.29s -> 412.29s]  Every voice is just like grandpa.
[412.29s -> 415.36s]  Whatever.
[415.36s -> 418.69s]  Just go. You know what? I'm just going to go. Go.
[418.69s -> 421.31s]  That didn't work so well.
[421.31s -> 424.45s]  Got to wait here.
[424.45s -> 428.45s]  This is the word. Meat Boy levels where you have to be patient.
[428.45s -> 430.45s]  I cannot do it.
[430.45s -> 432.45s]  When you got to be patient, I can't do it.
[432.45s -> 434.62s]  I cannot stand it.
[434.62s -> 436.62s]  I just want to go as fast as I possibly can.
[436.62s -> 438.99s]  That really just killed me.
[438.99s -> 440.99s]  Got to go as humanly possible.
[440.99s -> 443.99s]  As fast as I possibly humanly, humanly can.
[444.99s -> 446.62s]  No, come here.
[446.62s -> 450.90s]  No, my...
[450.90s -> 453.59s]  Oh, at least I'm not dying.
[453.59s -> 455.59s]  Oh my god.
[455.59s -> 457.59s]  What the hell?
[458.59s -> 460.59s]  Alright, that's not going to happen again.
[460.59s -> 464.48s]  Told you.
[464.48s -> 467.00s]  Get the girl.
[467.00s -> 469.00s]  Take her back to mom and dad's.
[469.00s -> 471.00s]  Have some dinner.
[471.00s -> 475.35s]  Meet the fam.
[475.35s -> 477.35s]  Oh boy, this thing moves. This thing moves and yet it moves.
[477.35s -> 479.59s]  Isn't that a game?
[479.59s -> 481.90s]  I think that's a game.
[484.46s -> 491.80s]  Oh crap.
[493.80s -> 496.81s]  Otto.
[496.81s -> 501.40s]  There we go.
[501.40s -> 505.37s]  Hello, my queen.
[505.37s -> 508.12s]  Rustic. Sounds pretty rustic to me.
[508.12s -> 510.12s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[510.12s -> 513.13s]  Oh god.
[513.13s -> 517.34s]  Okay, good thing I didn't...
[517.34s -> 521.56s]  Just got to go, got to go, got to go.
[521.56s -> 523.56s]  Alright, getting to the boss here.
[523.56s -> 525.56s]  I think the boss is...
[525.56s -> 527.56s]  I remember the boss in this level is
[527.56s -> 530.18s]  difficult.
[530.18s -> 532.18s]  And I'm probably going to use so many lives
[532.18s -> 534.18s]  at that boss.
[534.18s -> 538.28s]  It's not even funny.
[538.28s -> 543.53s]  Oh my god, how am I going to get this
[543.53s -> 545.53s]  like that? That's how you're going to get it.
[545.53s -> 549.05s]  And you're not going to die here.
[549.05s -> 551.05s]  It's all about the patience.
[551.05s -> 553.05s]  My patience, my young padawan.
[553.05s -> 555.05s]  And you will be victorious.
[555.05s -> 557.61s]  Don't go yet. Okay, go.
[557.61s -> 560.04s]  Yes. Alright, well
[560.04s -> 562.79s]  right after beating that level, we
[562.79s -> 564.79s]  just had a crash, but that's okay.
[564.79s -> 566.79s]  Back, ready to do it again.
[566.79s -> 569.42s]  Come on, bro. Come on, bro.
[569.42s -> 572.17s]  Oh, look at these dodges.
[572.17s -> 574.60s]  Dude, why am I playing
[574.60s -> 576.60s]  the Super Mario Bros. 2 level where you have to
[576.60s -> 579.16s]  dig down? I forget
[579.16s -> 581.16s]  what you have to do here. Oh my god,
[581.16s -> 583.98s]  what do I do? Oh my god.
[583.98s -> 585.98s]  Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[585.98s -> 587.98s]  I totally forget what you have to do here.
[587.98s -> 591.82s]  What does go-
[591.82s -> 593.82s]  Oh, no, no, no. Okay, I remember, I remember.
[593.82s -> 595.82s]  You go through here. Okay.
[595.82s -> 598.50s]  There we go. For a second
[598.50s -> 600.50s]  I was just, by brain, had no idea
[600.50s -> 603.51s]  what was going on. Would you just get in there
[603.51s -> 608.38s]  you sloppy bastard?
[608.38s -> 610.38s]  And this is going to be another Biahu.
[610.38s -> 613.83s]  Yes it is. Oh, hi.
[613.83s -> 617.98s]  Uh, Biahu?
[617.98s -> 620.41s]  Now I know you. I will probably say
[620.41s -> 622.97s]  I hate
[622.97s -> 625.34s]  these things. These are the absolute
[625.34s -> 627.34s]  worst things in the game.
[627.34s -> 630.47s]  These stupid missile launches.
[630.47s -> 634.70s]  Oh, you're going to take this- come on.
[634.70s -> 637.13s]  I'll jump over you all day.
[637.13s -> 642.87s]  Yes. Okay.
[642.87s -> 644.87s]  Hopefully I don't crash at the
[644.87s -> 647.82s]  boss, because that would not be good.
[647.82s -> 651.38s]  Brownie. I gotta go,
[651.38s -> 653.38s]  gotta go. Help me. Please.
[653.38s -> 655.38s]  Oh, you're here. Of course I'm here. You're my
[655.38s -> 657.38s]  girlfriend. Excuse me, you can't
[657.38s -> 659.38s]  touch that. I will be hitting this button
[659.38s -> 661.38s]  right now. Or pulling this lever, same thing.
[661.38s -> 663.38s]  Here comes your toilet.
[663.38s -> 665.88s]  Who's it going to be?
[665.88s -> 667.88s]  Oh my god. What the hell
[667.88s -> 669.88s]  is going on? What is this?
[669.88s -> 672.31s]  It's- oh, it stinks.
[672.31s -> 674.31s]  What is it?
[674.31s -> 677.00s]  Who is that?
[677.00s -> 679.56s]  Hey guys, it's me.
[679.56s -> 681.56s]  Brownie.
[681.56s -> 683.56s]  Alright, let's go.
[683.56s -> 685.56s]  You have to beat this guy in a race,
[685.56s -> 688.18s]  that's all I remember. Oh, you are
[688.18s -> 690.18s]  done. I- come on.
[690.18s -> 693.00s]  Oh, no.
[693.00s -> 696.14s]  I gotta be right up his ass the whole time.
[696.14s -> 698.89s]  I can hear, like, my phone
[698.89s -> 700.89s]  ringing. You guys hear that?
[700.89s -> 702.89s]  Whoever you're calling right- whoever's calling
[702.89s -> 704.89s]  me right now can't talk. Fighting
[704.89s -> 706.89s]  Brownie. I'm not really fighting him, but
[706.89s -> 710.34s]  racing him. Oh,
[710.34s -> 712.34s]  you just got passed.
[712.34s -> 715.48s]  You just got passed, man.
[715.48s -> 718.62s]  You got passed. Just don't
[718.62s -> 720.62s]  screw this up. Oh, what a
[720.62s -> 723.11s]  s- come on. No!
[723.11s -> 727.02s]  Ugh! Damn it!
[727.02s -> 729.02s]  I was way ahead of him, too.
[729.02s -> 731.32s]  I was running circles around him.
[731.32s -> 735.16s]  I have to stay way ahead.
[735.16s -> 737.16s]  This is where you gotta get some ground, right here.
[737.16s -> 740.15s]  Down here, and then don't be
[740.15s -> 742.65s]  a stupid idiot.
[742.65s -> 744.65s]  See, right there I screwed that up.
[744.65s -> 746.65s]  Screwed it up. Oh, my god.
[746.65s -> 750.87s]  Totally screwed everything up.
[750.87s -> 752.87s]  Go, go- oh, who's talking to me on Skype?
[752.87s -> 754.87s]  I'm getting all these, like, notifications.
[754.87s -> 756.87s]  Come on, you bastard!
[756.87s -> 758.87s]  What? What? What? Okay.
[758.87s -> 761.42s]  Thank god.
[761.42s -> 764.42s]  I made it.
[764.42s -> 766.42s]  Please don't kill me. I'm- I don't wanna-
[766.42s -> 768.42s]  I got you, buddy. Don't worry.
[768.42s -> 770.42s]  Thank you, man.
[770.42s -> 773.18s]  I appreciate it.
[773.18s -> 775.18s]  You'll never take him. I'm gonna throw another brick in his face.
[775.18s -> 777.18s]  You'll see-
[777.18s -> 779.74s]  Dude, what are you doing?
[779.74s -> 781.74s]  Leave him alone. She-
[781.74s -> 784.23s]  I love you.
[784.23s -> 786.23s]  I love you, too, man. You're gonna
[786.23s -> 788.23s]  get it. Hi there, how are you? You're dead
[788.23s -> 790.23s]  when I see you, man. I'm jumping over there. I'm gonna kick
[790.23s -> 792.23s]  the absolute crap out of you.
[792.23s -> 794.23s]  Not if I press this button.
[794.23s -> 796.23s]  I'll just throw it at you.
[799.93s -> 802.17s]  Alright, guys.
[802.17s -> 804.47s]  That's chapter three in the bag.
[804.47s -> 806.47s]  The salt factory.
[806.47s -> 808.47s]  The salt and sugar factory.
[808.47s -> 810.47s]  And hell is
[810.47s -> 812.47s]  next, chapter four.
[812.47s -> 815.22s]  Let's see how good I do there.
[815.22s -> 817.78s]  But in the meantime, of course,
[817.78s -> 819.78s]  enjoy the rest of your day or night, and
[819.78s -> 821.78s]  I'll see you guys all next time. And of course,
[821.78s -> 823.78s]  take care, everybody.
