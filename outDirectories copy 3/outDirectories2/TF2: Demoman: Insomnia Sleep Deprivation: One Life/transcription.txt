[0.31s -> 9.38s]  Hey, what is happening everybody?
[9.38s -> 15.38s]  Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary playing today as the Demoman.
[15.38s -> 20.38s]  Using the regular grenade launcher, the regular default sticky launcher, and the half Zatoichi.
[20.38s -> 25.38s]  Got a pretty good gameplay coming up here. I'm sorry, I really do apologize to you guys.
[25.38s -> 31.38s]  Because this is really my first Demoman gameplay in a long time, probably since like the summertime.
[31.38s -> 36.62s]  I've done Demo Night gameplays, but those don't really count, to be quite honest.
[36.62s -> 39.62s]  They're just for fun, they're just for the lulz, I guess.
[39.62s -> 43.62s]  But this is a real Demoman gameplay, just right now showing off a double Kritzkrieg.
[43.62s -> 46.62s]  Because I thought it was ridiculous and I had to put it in.
[46.62s -> 49.62s]  But this is not the gameplay, the gameplay is going to start in about 30 seconds or so.
[49.62s -> 54.92s]  So that first Kritzkrieg went pretty well, but the second one not so much.
[54.92s -> 57.92s]  I really did not expect it. I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, why am I getting two Kritzkriegs?
[57.92s -> 60.35s]  What's happening to me?
[60.35s -> 64.35s]  This right here, I love this part. I get the half Zatoichi Krit on that medic and then watch this.
[64.35s -> 68.35s]  I know I'm going to die, so I just jump out of here like boing.
[68.35s -> 70.78s]  I just thought that was a great clip.
[70.78s -> 76.22s]  So now let's transition to the real gameplay, also on Gold Rush, also on Defense.
[76.22s -> 81.39s]  I actually just watched this whole thing back, and I guess this is a one life gameplay.
[81.39s -> 83.82s]  I didn't even realize that.
[83.82s -> 86.82s]  But what I want to talk about in this gameplay, as you'll know from the title,
[86.82s -> 94.00s]  I want to talk about insomnia and I want to talk about sleep deprivation and what it does to you.
[94.00s -> 98.61s]  So right now I'm looking at my fake watch on my arm right now.
[98.61s -> 101.61s]  It is five o'clock in the morning right now as I'm recording this.
[101.61s -> 104.85s]  Now I haven't slept at all. I haven't gone to bed and woken up.
[104.85s -> 108.85s]  It's not like, oh, it's five in the morning. Time to get up and go on my regular day.
[108.85s -> 110.85s]  No, I haven't gone to bed yet.
[110.85s -> 116.85s]  I actually have been lying in my bed for like three hours trying to go to sleep and it's just not happening.
[116.85s -> 123.22s]  And this is a real problem with me right now where I'm going to sleep at like six or seven in the morning
[123.22s -> 127.46s]  and waking up at seven or eight o'clock at night.
[127.46s -> 131.46s]  Sometimes a little earlier than that, but a lot of times I get up around five to eight at night.
[131.46s -> 134.82s]  And it's really starting to mess with my brain.
[134.82s -> 137.77s]  So here's a good example of this, right?
[137.77s -> 140.77s]  So I go to sleep when it's dark outside.
[140.77s -> 145.14s]  Five a.m. or six a.m. the sun still has not risen yet.
[146.38s -> 150.38s]  And then when I wake up at like six or seven at night, it's dark out.
[150.38s -> 154.38s]  So when I go to sleep when it's dark out and wake up when it's dark out,
[154.38s -> 159.38s]  my brain pretty much is saying, Jerma, are we living in the friggin' Ice Age?
[159.38s -> 162.74s]  What the hell is going on? And it really screws with you.
[162.74s -> 165.74s]  And it's also really hard to correct as well.
[165.74s -> 169.74s]  I can't just really snap my fingers and go, I'm going to wake up tomorrow at a reasonable time.
[169.74s -> 172.74s]  I'm going to go to sleep at a reasonable time. No, no, no, it doesn't work that way.
[172.74s -> 177.74s]  The only way to really correct this is to stay up this entire day,
[177.74s -> 182.05s]  drink four or five cups of coffee, and just go.
[182.05s -> 188.22s]  And stay awake, try as hard as I can, force myself to stay awake until like nine o'clock at night.
[188.22s -> 190.59s]  And I've tried to do this so many times.
[190.59s -> 193.59s]  I go, yeah, let's get some coffee. I'm going to play some video games.
[193.59s -> 194.59s]  I'm going to stay up.
[194.59s -> 199.59s]  And what ends up happening, somewhere around noon to two, I'd say,
[199.59s -> 202.59s]  I just go, oh, that bed looks great over there.
[202.59s -> 208.90s]  And I just fall into it and just die and stay asleep until like 11 o'clock at night.
[208.90s -> 213.82s]  And at that point, you pretty much just live in Japan.
[213.82s -> 218.82s]  And one really horrible thing about all this, I will fall asleep at one o'clock in the afternoon,
[218.82s -> 222.82s]  sleep the whole day the whole night, look at my cell phone,
[222.82s -> 227.82s]  and there will be four or five missed calls and at least two messages I didn't get to.
[227.82s -> 229.82s]  And people probably think I'm dead.
[229.82s -> 234.13s]  I tried to call you like four times during when human beings are awake,
[234.13s -> 236.13s]  and you didn't answer, like, what are you doing?
[236.13s -> 241.56s]  And this has been going on for quite a long time, at least in my case.
[241.56s -> 246.74s]  I started doing this, started the whole sleep during the day and wake up at night thing.
[246.74s -> 249.74s]  I started doing this probably my first year in college.
[249.74s -> 254.74s]  I was a freshman, and obviously I was one of those people that loved to be awake at night.
[254.74s -> 256.74s]  Night owl, real night owl in high school.
[256.74s -> 259.74s]  But you can't really be a night owl in high school.
[259.74s -> 262.74s]  It's very difficult because you have to wake up really early.
[262.74s -> 265.10s]  So in college, I started to get the freedom.
[265.10s -> 267.10s]  I said, all right, this is awesome.
[267.10s -> 268.10s]  I can do whatever I want.
[268.10s -> 271.34s]  I have class at like 12 p.m.
[271.34s -> 276.02s]  And that's where all this started, going on probably seven years now.
[276.02s -> 281.02s]  And it kind of concerns me because I'm afraid I'm going to go to the doctor one day and tell him all this.
[281.02s -> 287.50s]  And he's going to go, uh, Jeremy, that's, uh, you're going to die tomorrow or something like that.
[287.50s -> 292.50s]  You know, oh, you're going to die in like three months because your brain can't get enough activity or something crazy.
[292.50s -> 294.50s]  But it really does concern me sometimes.
[294.50s -> 297.93s]  So I'm trying to, as I get older, correct it.
[297.93s -> 304.93s]  So let me know in the comments section if you guys as well are dealing with insomnia or if you've gone through something like this before.
[304.93s -> 309.93s]  And if you have any tips or any folk remedies or something along the lines of, well,
[309.93s -> 316.93s]  if you smell onions and you brush your teeth for 35 seconds exactly, you fall asleep within 10 minutes of lying down.
[316.93s -> 321.30s]  If you guys have something like that, let me know because I definitely would like to hear it.
[321.30s -> 324.66s]  So let's wrap this up by talking about the gameplay a little bit.
[324.66s -> 328.66s]  I have a really bad fail coming up and it's pretty embarrassing.
[328.66s -> 331.66s]  So you'll see it when it comes. It's at the very end of the gameplay.
[331.66s -> 333.97s]  It's actually why we lose the game.
[333.97s -> 335.97s]  But I've done pretty well. I haven't done terribly.
[335.97s -> 338.97s]  This is a pretty good gameplay, got a bunch of kills, bunch of critscreegs,
[338.97s -> 342.97s]  had a couple of medic buddies that were with me pretty much the whole time.
[342.97s -> 344.27s]  So it works out OK.
[344.27s -> 346.70s]  But here comes the fail.
[346.70s -> 349.70s]  At the end of that critscreeg kills the sniper up in that roost.
[349.70s -> 351.70s]  I turn around, see a soldier and a scout.
[351.70s -> 354.70s]  I'm like, oh, does the soldier got this on? He's got it under control, baby.
[354.70s -> 357.70s]  So I turn around, preoccupy myself with the sniper.
[357.70s -> 361.70s]  And instead of going back there and dropping some stickies on the cart,
[361.70s -> 363.70s]  a heavy gets on it and we lose the game.
[363.70s -> 367.22s]  But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[367.22s -> 369.22s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[369.22s -> 370.22s]  Really do appreciate it.
[370.22s -> 373.22s]  So I will see you guys all next time.
[373.22s -> 376.22s]  Take care, everybody.
