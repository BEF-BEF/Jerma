[0.31s -> 12.71s]  Um, yeah, I have one. Oh, did you just die?
[16.78s -> 20.50s]  What just happened did you just fall off the bridge
[23.20s -> 27.84s]  Seriously, I fell through one of the holes in the damn bridge. I'm like
[34.14s -> 37.40s]  Were you recording yeah, I
[38.92s -> 45.52s]  Say we just give you all this stuff back I had the enchanted it's all gone down there man. Oh
[46.90s -> 48.66s]  Jeez, I
[48.66s -> 51.73s]  Don't think I took a backup of this map. Oh
[52.77s -> 54.77s]  last time okay, I
[55.77s -> 58.25s]  Guess that's all we need hopefully
[58.97s -> 64.68s]  There's I there's a creeper out here though. All right, we'll take care of them. We got three doors
[65.12s -> 68.88s]  We got two creepers actually, that's that's the way to the creepers
[68.88s -> 70.88s]  Alright, so let's go the back door. I
[73.00s -> 75.00s]  Don't see anything
[78.96s -> 83.92s]  Okay, okay, we're good we're good got that one got that one we didn't shut the door though
[83.92s -> 86.36s]  All right, we'll shut the door after we kill this bastard
[86.84s -> 92.53s]  You're gonna blow up. What are you doing? I'm pushing him back. I'm doing like the sprint attack
[92.53s -> 96.67s]  He's like honest. He's chilling on top of the tree. Now. He's like he's like I'm pretty cool up here
[96.67s -> 98.73s]  He's like a tree frog. What is he doing? I?
[99.73s -> 101.25s]  Think with the
[101.25s -> 106.49s]  One point with one point two. It's like they're more scared to jump down. It seems like they are
[107.09s -> 110.85s]  Already, I'm gonna try and wow what he really isn't coming down. Oh
[111.86s -> 113.86s]  There he goes watch out
[113.98s -> 122.06s]  There we go. Nice got a nice little crit hit on him close that door close the door and onwards we go. All right, so I
[122.98s -> 127.78s]  For those of you that don't know I just ruined everything essentially. I
[128.82s -> 134.22s]  I broke a bunch of stuff because I fell in the lava with the enchanted bow and pretty much
[134.22s -> 137.34s]  I'm just a terrible person. So that's uh, that's that story
[139.34s -> 143.54s]  Hold shift from now on that's what we got to do. He's kind of like cross the bridge. Oh, I
[144.23s -> 145.91s]  Totally forgot about that
[145.91s -> 149.05s]  While holding shift if you hold shift that you won't fall through
[149.71s -> 155.32s]  And also for those of you wondering Leptor is away on vacation
[156.08s -> 159.32s]  So we had to continue on briefly without him
[160.18s -> 168.64s]  Yep, and he should be back pretty soon man though with the one block wide stuffs really scary
[169.18s -> 177.55s]  Yeah, I I couldn't believe I fell through that. I couldn't believe it. I don't know how to really destroy spiderwebs
[177.55s -> 185.13s]  Maybe a pickaxe is faster. They seem like they take a long time to break sword sword. Okay
[185.81s -> 187.81s]  You sir win
[189.41s -> 195.02s]  All right, you I guess whoa, they're awesome traps apparently laid
[195.46s -> 197.46s]  And we've got a mob spawner right here
[198.92s -> 204.96s]  So all I have to do is destroy it with the wooden pick before it spawns any any pesky spiders
[204.96s -> 211.27s]  And there's a chest in here, too. You shouldn't attempt this if you are not yet ready. I'm feeling it's going to explode
[211.31s -> 217.48s]  That's what I feel. So you so I should open it then look down here. Look down here. Oh wow
[220.92s -> 225.52s]  Frozen waterfall, that's pretty crazy. So all right, you know, you don't think you want me to open this
[225.68s -> 226.68s]  Here's what we should do
[226.68s -> 232.50s]  Okay, if one of us needs to stand like way back here where it's safe like as far back as possible
[232.50s -> 236.70s]  I have the most stuff so go ahead and open it and if it starts hissing run for your life
[236.70s -> 243.17s]  Okay, here we go. Oh my god. There's a lot of stuff in here. Is it hissing? No, but it's I'm scared
[243.17s -> 246.13s]  There's a ton of leather. There's a ton. I don't know. How do I take things really fast? There we go
[248.34s -> 250.34s]  Something's gonna explode with
[250.82s -> 252.82s]  Out of the chest, okay
[254.50s -> 256.50s]  What's going on? You're stuck in the you're stuck
[258.30s -> 264.38s]  Okay, that was yeah, if you shouldn't attempt this yeah, right, I think maybe they mean the drop down here
[265.06s -> 267.36s]  Alright, I got a bunch of leather
[267.76s -> 273.12s]  Alright, let's go back over here where it's kind of safe and like craft that leather into armor for you real quick
[273.36s -> 278.51s]  Yeah, make sure I don't waste it this time. I want to say the raw fish is just like one
[278.77s -> 284.94s]  So I think I'm gonna go ahead and eat one of those. Yeah, we got company. There's a there's a skeleton coming down here
[285.62s -> 288.34s]  Well with the with the update they're gonna stay in the shadow
[288.74s -> 294.80s]  So they're not gonna follow you too far while the Sun is shining bright in the sky. There's another one up there
[294.80s -> 300.82s]  I'll get him. I'll get this rat bastard. So do you want to go up? Oh, wow watch out behind you
[304.86s -> 310.10s]  Well, they just pulled out it's alright we're good. Oh, there's like a cup
[310.10s -> 311.68s]  There's like a bunch of spawners in here
[311.68s -> 316.12s]  Do we want to do this first or do we want to do like the waterfall thing first down there? Oh, well
[316.12s -> 321.74s]  I guess we're already in here might as well destroy the spawner. Okay. Oh watch out hit that guy
[321.92s -> 324.48s]  Yeah, leave him alone. He's my friend
[325.04s -> 330.76s]  Yeah, one of us has to like distract while the other one which has like destroys and if you want to destroy one
[330.76s -> 335.23s]  It's with your pickaxe. I don't have a pickaxe. Oh, yeah. Whoa. Yeah
[335.83s -> 340.56s]  That guy yeah, I'm getting close to being dead close. Okay
[341.85s -> 345.71s]  How's your hunger doing? I got 70%
[346.11s -> 351.35s]  All right here take take this bread and once your hungers full you'll start healing automatically
[351.83s -> 355.31s]  Bunch of a bunch of coal bunch of arrows in this chest bones
[356.11s -> 362.91s]  Do you still have a bow? I do. I guess you took the arrows already. Yeah
[363.27s -> 368.27s]  What we should do is like all these bones are gonna be really valuable
[368.27s -> 371.75s]  So I'm thinking just put them in a chest. Yeah, like make a chest over here
[371.91s -> 374.87s]  Do you still have the crafting table down here? It's still down there
[375.47s -> 379.60s]  It's down. Also, um, oh never mind. We got this heel pad out here
[379.60s -> 384.28s]  So if we start running out of food, we can like retreat and like heal up. All right
[385.66s -> 390.82s]  Hey, you want me to throw these bones down to you? Oh, sure
[391.26s -> 395.17s]  All right, where should I? Oh, it's creeper behind you creeper creeper coming up behind you
[395.81s -> 402.01s]  What where did they just fall? I just like throw it down then like the water. I think I see them
[402.89s -> 406.25s]  Gotta watch out for this guy though. Oh, wait, can I like shoot him with the oh, you got up
[406.25s -> 410.21s]  We got a zombie here, too. Don't don't waste the arrows unless you have to okay. He's in the water
[410.21s -> 417.29s]  So I'm just oh now he's up man. They're crafty. They're cunning. Yeah, watch yourself. Okay. I'm safe
[418.13s -> 425.02s]  I'm gonna throw all the bones down at you. There's a zombie coming for one of us and now a thunderstorm
[425.38s -> 434.06s]  What was that? It was like it was just thunder. Oh, oh, I gotta turn my volume down again. Get that son of a B
[434.70s -> 441.91s]  Right. Well, what does it mean? There's just a thing of fire just sitting here burning on obsidian. Where are we at?
[442.05s -> 445.17s]  This is um, there's like see I think that's just netherrack
[445.97s -> 449.21s]  Bunch, but I put all the redstone torches around it kind of freaked me out
[450.65s -> 455.42s]  I got a bunch of arrows. No, here's uh, here's seven more. Oh
[456.22s -> 460.46s]  All right. Here's what we're gonna have to do. See how the floor is made out of obsidian. Yeah
[460.98s -> 469.58s]  That's scary because there could be explosions here obsidian is resistant to explosions. So like, you know, I'm saying like the floor won't crumble
[469.58s -> 476.46s]  Okay, there's something explodes. So be careful when you're removing these redstone torches because they could set off
[477.06s -> 478.30s]  explosion
[478.30s -> 486.13s]  Yeah, so we gotta listen. All right, we're good. And that's that netherrack
[486.53s -> 491.37s]  So is this just that's it. There's nothing else here. I don't I hope we don't just randomly explode
[491.37s -> 495.13s]  I feel like there should be like another
[496.10s -> 500.58s]  Area or something. Well, what's with like the broken edges on these walls? You know what I mean?
[500.58s -> 503.50s]  See how like the walls are kind of cracked over here. Um, I
[504.06s -> 512.10s]  What's that mean? Yeah, that's I don't know that. Oh, there's another area good fine. Gerber fine. Watch out. That's lava
[515.14s -> 517.14s]  Can you get that chest without ooh
[517.94s -> 522.34s]  Golden sword, which is not the greatest thing in the world, but there's another one over here. Okay
[522.70s -> 526.02s]  Do you have a pickaxe? Did I already ask you that? I do not have a pickaxe
[526.06s -> 530.48s]  It take mine. I've got a lot more stuff than you so break break the other side
[531.22s -> 533.68s]  I'm really scared. Someone's gonna explode in here
[534.70s -> 540.30s]  Here we go. I'm like trying to stay as far back as I can. All right
[540.30s -> 544.90s]  It's a very long hallway and a sign you can have that back
[548.05s -> 551.61s]  You want me to go first? I guess man obsidian hall
[551.61s -> 558.09s]  Well, nothing can get through us in this hallway shivering sands one record. So there's a this is a whole nother area
[558.09s -> 560.09s]  It sounds like well
[560.57s -> 565.70s]  Apparently you drop down. That looks kind of sketchy. I don't know about that
