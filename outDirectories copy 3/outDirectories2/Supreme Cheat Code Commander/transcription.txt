[5.05s -> 13.55s]  The question will be answered, tonight, who in fact is the supreme commander of the armies at hand?
[14.98s -> 15.98s]  What the hell, what the fuck was that?
[15.98s -> 16.98s]  I said I'm not ready.
[17.48s -> 18.48s]  Why are you not ready?
[18.48s -> 19.48s]  I got a cat.
[20.92s -> 21.92s]  You don't have a cat.
[21.92s -> 23.92s]  It's getting everywhere, there's hair in my mic.
[23.92s -> 24.92s]  You don't have...
[25.92s -> 33.61s]  You take your little guy, and you generate the power by putting the nodes on the things,
[33.61s -> 37.61s]  and you build buildings to build units, and then I just fucking stomp you.
[38.11s -> 39.11s]  I think this is going to take too long.
[40.11s -> 41.11s]  I don't think it's going to take too long.
[41.61s -> 43.11s]  I'm just going to kill you right now.
[44.11s -> 45.11s]  What did you just do?
[45.11s -> 46.11s]  What the fuck is this?
[48.95s -> 49.95s]  Gig.
[49.95s -> 53.83s]  Oh, oh, look at, look at what's going on on the bottom there.
[53.83s -> 58.83s]  Oh, Ster is cheating, and fucking like, it's just blinking.
[58.83s -> 61.90s]  It's just blinking on the bottom of my screen.
[61.90s -> 65.40s]  You could blink in StarCraft, that wasn't considered cheating, it was an ability.
[65.40s -> 66.90s]  I'm playing Protoss.
[68.52s -> 69.52s]  How do you cheat?
[69.52s -> 71.02s]  Cheat, activate.
[73.15s -> 75.15s]  How do you do that?
[75.15s -> 78.15s]  You open up the console, and you type the cheat.
[78.15s -> 82.15s]  I don't know what that is, I'm trying to like, make my units, I'm trying to like, feed my like,
[82.15s -> 84.15s]  soldiers and shit, and you overhear, cheat.
[88.33s -> 90.33s]  You teleported in here.
[93.77s -> 94.77s]  What is happening?
[94.77s -> 96.84s]  What is happening?
[96.84s -> 97.84s]  What is happening?
[97.84s -> 98.84s]  I don't know what this is.
[98.84s -> 100.84s]  This is like, my game is...
[100.84s -> 107.05s]  This is going to break the game.
[107.05s -> 110.87s]  I thought my game just broke, but I accidentally clicked out of it.
[111.37s -> 113.37s]  Alright, so gentlemen's rules.
[113.37s -> 114.37s]  No attacking.
[114.37s -> 119.37s]  Do not attack me, I'm not going to attack you, until we both have a thousand units.
[119.37s -> 120.37s]  Okay?
[120.37s -> 121.37s]  Yeah, okay.
[124.08s -> 125.08s]  Are those all air guys?
[125.08s -> 126.08s]  What the heck are those?
[126.08s -> 127.08s]  Yeah, these are all planes.
[127.08s -> 129.32s]  And there's so many units, dude, they have nowhere to go.
[129.32s -> 134.29s]  They're all turning into this one like, blob in the middle.
[134.29s -> 138.29s]  It's like sucking up, it's sucking up the planes into like, one giant plane.
[138.29s -> 140.46s]  Do you see this?
[140.46s -> 142.46s]  No, I'm busy making my own suck up planes.
[142.46s -> 144.46s]  It's like...
[145.46s -> 146.46s]  This is turning into like, just a...
[146.46s -> 148.46s]  Oh dear god.
[148.46s -> 150.46s]  I don't even want to know what's going to happen with this.
[150.46s -> 154.17s]  The game's going to start to freak out.
[154.17s -> 155.17s]  And not know what the hell is going on.
[155.17s -> 157.99s]  I almost have a thousand units.
[157.99s -> 158.99s]  Whoa, whoa, where are they going?
[158.99s -> 159.99s]  Where are you guys going?
[159.99s -> 161.99s]  I don't know, they're coming to attack me.
[161.99s -> 162.99s]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[162.99s -> 163.99s]  Pull back!
[163.99s -> 164.99s]  What are they doing?
[164.99s -> 165.99s]  I'm trying, I'm trying to pull back!
[165.99s -> 166.99s]  I'm trying!
[167.99s -> 168.99s]  They won't listen!
[168.99s -> 170.99s]  They have a mind of their own, I can't...
[170.99s -> 172.99s]  They won't listen to me!
[172.99s -> 175.99s]  I guess that's just what happens when you have a thousand units.
[175.99s -> 176.99s]  Get out of here!
[177.49s -> 180.18s]  I'm trying to pull it back!
[180.18s -> 182.18s]  Holy shit!
[182.18s -> 184.18s]  No, you fucking idiot!
[184.18s -> 185.18s]  I'm trying!
[185.18s -> 187.18s]  Don't engage!
[187.18s -> 188.18s]  What are you doing?
[188.18s -> 190.18s]  You're not supposed to engage!
[190.18s -> 191.18s]  Now it's just a mess!
[191.18s -> 192.18s]  Just pull back!
[192.18s -> 193.18s]  Look what you've done!
[193.18s -> 194.18s]  You've brought everybody!
[194.18s -> 195.18s]  I have!
[195.18s -> 196.18s]  You've brought everybody!
[196.18s -> 197.18s]  No!
[197.18s -> 198.18s]  You attacked one person in all of this!
[198.18s -> 201.18s]  It just looks like a firework exploded!
[201.18s -> 204.18s]  My game's running very slowly, by the way.
[204.18s -> 205.18s]  I can't even...
[205.18s -> 206.18s]  You did this.
[206.18s -> 207.18s]  You shouldn't have attacked.
[207.18s -> 208.68s]  No, you attacked!
[208.68s -> 210.68s]  All your guys were coming at me!
[210.68s -> 211.68s]  And you didn't pull any of them back!
[211.68s -> 213.68s]  You select and you right-click!
[213.68s -> 215.68s]  Select and then right-click!
[215.68s -> 216.68s]  I did!
[220.77s -> 221.77s]  Look at the gravity!
[222.77s -> 226.61s]  What is happening?
[226.61s -> 228.04s]  I don't know!
[228.04s -> 230.04s]  Where did those guys go?
[230.04s -> 233.37s]  What are they still shooting at?
[233.37s -> 236.83s]  I hope you're happy.
[236.83s -> 242.40s]  You're gonna build a bunch of turrets.
[242.40s -> 244.40s]  And I'm coming after you with GS Rats.
[245.96s -> 247.96s]  So you build as many turrets as you possibly can.
[248.46s -> 252.46s]  If you change your mind later, there's air turrets and there's ground turrets.
[252.46s -> 254.46s]  Don't be like, okay, now it's the air units.
[254.46s -> 255.46s]  Let's see how this goes.
[255.46s -> 256.46s]  Like, it's not gonna happen.
[256.46s -> 258.46s]  No, I'm coming at you with GS Rats.
[258.46s -> 260.46s]  I'm gonna build a thousand rats and you're gonna build towers.
[260.46s -> 261.46s]  You ready?
[261.46s -> 264.40s]  We'll start typing bling-bling!
[264.40s -> 266.40s]  If you select them all too and do the alt-T,
[266.40s -> 269.40s]  you can keep them in a tiny, a small area.
[269.40s -> 270.40s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[270.40s -> 271.40s]  If I select everybody...
[271.40s -> 273.40s]  Select them all and do alt-T where your cursor is pointing.
[273.40s -> 274.77s]  Alt-T.
[274.77s -> 275.77s]  Alt-T.
[275.77s -> 280.26s]  Didn't do anything.
[280.26s -> 281.26s]  Oh dear, dude!
[281.76s -> 283.76s]  My FPS!
[283.76s -> 286.06s]  Oh man!
[286.06s -> 288.06s]  Why did you tell me to do that?
[288.06s -> 289.06s]  I don't know.
[289.06s -> 291.06s]  It looks like you got a little planet there.
[291.06s -> 293.36s]  Oh, don't zoom in and look at them.
[293.36s -> 294.36s]  I cannot zoom in, no.
[294.36s -> 296.36s]  Yeah, zoom out and just...
[296.36s -> 298.36s]  Oh dear, why did you have me do that?
[298.36s -> 301.50s]  Why did you make me do that?
[301.50s -> 304.00s]  I can't even look over there.
[304.00s -> 306.00s]  No, I need to spread them out.
[306.00s -> 308.00s]  I need to, like, pull them out.
[308.00s -> 310.00s]  Because I can't even go over there.
[310.00s -> 311.00s]  Wait, I heard a launch.
[311.00s -> 312.00s]  What do you mean?
[312.50s -> 313.50s]  No, no, no, no.
[313.50s -> 314.50s]  We spent so much time.
[314.50s -> 315.50s]  We spent so much time doing this.
[315.50s -> 316.50s]  We didn't spend that much time.
[316.50s -> 319.50s]  No, dude, please don't tell me you just dropped a fucking bomb.
[319.50s -> 321.50s]  I mean, you teleported them all there.
[322.50s -> 324.50s]  What a waste of fucking time.
[324.50s -> 326.50s]  No, that's so good.
[326.50s -> 328.50s]  You broke the whole rat colony.
[328.50s -> 332.08s]  Uh, here they come.
[332.08s -> 333.08s]  Okay, well...
[333.08s -> 335.09s]  Come on, rats.
[335.09s -> 337.09s]  I've got a good view angle of this.
[337.09s -> 339.09s]  Break through the defenses!
[341.09s -> 343.09s]  Let's see if they get even close to me.
[343.09s -> 344.09s]  Where are they going?
[344.09s -> 345.59s]  They're, like, wrapping around here.
[346.83s -> 348.83s]  Oh my god, I have so many, like, pop-ups
[348.83s -> 350.83s]  that's telling me, like, your game's broken.
[351.83s -> 354.58s]  No, they're not getting anywhere near it.
[354.58s -> 356.58s]  Come on, stop, like, bunching up, like, traffic
[356.58s -> 358.58s]  and push in.
[358.58s -> 361.14s]  They haven't even breached the wall yet.
[361.14s -> 363.14s]  Like, half of them aren't moving.
[363.14s -> 365.38s]  Yeah, what are they doing?
[365.38s -> 367.38s]  You idiots!
[367.38s -> 369.38s]  Some of them are just standing completely still.
[371.00s -> 373.00s]  Oh, wow, this is fucking awful.
[374.24s -> 376.24s]  They're all going up the mountain and instantly dying.
[376.74s -> 378.74s]  It's because of the wall, I think.
[378.74s -> 380.74s]  Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[380.74s -> 382.74s]  Dude, they're just walking into the wall!
[382.74s -> 384.74s]  They're making themselves a choke point
[384.74s -> 386.74s]  and just getting shot to death
[386.74s -> 388.74s]  when they walk through it.
[388.74s -> 390.74s]  Like, over here by this stupid, like, fucking underpass.
[390.74s -> 392.74s]  They really are like ants.
