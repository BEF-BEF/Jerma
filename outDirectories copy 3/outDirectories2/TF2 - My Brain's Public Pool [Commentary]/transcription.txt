[5.24s -> 10.76s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[10.76s -> 17.08s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demoman with the lock and lo- that's not the lo- whoa whoa easy.
[17.08s -> 23.00s]  I'm so used to saying that when I play demo that I just said it. No, this is the Loose Cannon.
[23.00s -> 28.36s]  Loose Cannon, Islander, and Tideturner, which is pretty standard at this point to have the Tideturner
[28.36s -> 33.85s]  on because it is so good. But Loose Cannon, just had the urge to play with it. Just felt like throwing
[33.85s -> 38.98s]  it on, get some kills, get some glorious double dunked Orido double stuffed Oreos.
[38.98s -> 42.90s]  And it's gonna sit in the background like it typically will when we discuss some things,
[42.90s -> 46.58s]  in particular in a commentary style like you're seeing right here, which I haven't done
[47.22s -> 54.63s]  in quite a while, so I figured why not. And today's topic of today's video is when you
[54.63s -> 61.66s]  find yourself in a situation where you can't think about anything. Your brain is empty
[61.66s -> 67.03s]  because there's too much stuff to think about. I'm gonna try to make that make sense. What I
[67.03s -> 71.03s]  just said, I'm gonna try to make it make sense. And that's kind of the point of this video,
[71.03s -> 75.83s]  is slipping into a mindset where I've been recently, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have
[75.83s -> 80.87s]  been there as well, where your brain is just constantly, constantly thinking about things,
[80.87s -> 86.23s]  running at a thousand miles per hour with everything that's going on in your life currently.
[86.23s -> 92.06s]  And it makes it so difficult for you to focus on really anything at all. And now these things
[92.06s -> 98.30s]  could be good and bad things at the same time, and they just pull up in a giant caravan.
[98.30s -> 102.86s]  The mother gets out of the fucking car, pulls open the door, and like a bunch of kids come in and
[102.86s -> 107.66s]  jump into the public pool that is your brain. And maybe one of the kids, maybe one of the kids is
[107.66s -> 112.62s]  like, is a problem that you're having. You know, he jumps in the fucking pool. He has his sneakers
[112.62s -> 116.86s]  on for Christ's sake. What was that? You just heard some crashing noise behind you. Somebody
[116.86s -> 120.38s]  knocked over the hot dog stand. It's a kid running around the pool. You're like, hey,
[120.38s -> 125.02s]  no running at the pool, please. Another kid just jumps in and you're like, oh, what was that? What
[125.02s -> 129.42s]  just happened? Oh, that was a new job opportunity. But wait a second, you just pissed in the pool.
[129.42s -> 134.22s]  That kid just pissed in the pool. Oh, God damn it. I gotta go, I gotta get like the chlorine,
[134.22s -> 138.62s]  everybody out of the pool, and then like two more kids jump in. And that's like something else that
[138.62s -> 142.70s]  could be going on in your life, in your whole brain. Then all of a sudden you close the pool.
[142.70s -> 150.12s]  You say, everybody out of the fucking pool, because I've got to deal with this. And everybody gets
[150.12s -> 155.40s]  out of the pool. They all pile back into the caravan and then they all they take off. And then
[155.40s -> 161.91s]  you're just kind of left with an empty pool. I don't know how much sense that just made.
[161.91s -> 169.54s]  Probably none at all. But let me translate it in as best way that I possibly can. Instead of emptying
[169.54s -> 174.66s]  the pool, instead of instead of not doing anything and just kind of drifting back into, I don't know,
[174.66s -> 181.08s]  I don't give a shit about it. Whatever. Try to ground yourself and deal with each thing as it
[181.08s -> 188.06s]  comes to you at one at a time. Otherwise, you're just going to drive yourself batshit crazy.
[188.06s -> 193.26s]  And I can't even tell you how many times I've been in a situation, guys, where I've had a ton
[193.26s -> 198.87s]  of stuff to deal with and a ton of stuff to think about, that I just, I throw it all off to the side
[198.87s -> 203.43s]  and I just, I'm too overwhelmed to even think about doing any of the things that I've wanted
[203.43s -> 207.93s]  to do or wanted to say or deal with the bad things that are happening. You never want to
[207.93s -> 212.65s]  tackle everything at the same time. And as much as sometimes that can be unavoidable,
[212.65s -> 219.66s]  and that's one of the main problems with life in general, guys, is sometimes it's unavoidable.
[219.66s -> 226.06s]  Sometimes you just have a bunch of shit that is going on at the exact same time that you're just,
[226.06s -> 231.69s]  you don't, it's hard to not just open the pool and let everybody jump in. And like I said before,
[231.69s -> 235.62s]  if this made no sense at all, I'm going to listen to this back and I'm going to be like,
[236.18s -> 239.54s]  why do they, why would they ever want to take advice from me? I just told them there was a
[239.54s -> 243.30s]  fucking pool party going on in my brain. Like they're going to think I'm crazy.
[244.82s -> 249.30s]  No, all right. Ground yourself, get grounded. We're going to move on from that. I just wanted
[249.30s -> 254.18s]  to throw that out there because there's been a whole lot of stuff going on in my head recently,
[254.18s -> 259.62s]  both good and bad. But remember, this is not talking about like, oh, how everything is so bad,
[259.62s -> 264.41s]  everything is so bad. No, no, no. It's just when you have too much to think about and too many
[264.41s -> 268.89s]  things going on at the same time, you can, it can rack your brain. And that was the point
[268.89s -> 273.77s]  of what I just said. Don't worry. I'm fine. I hope all you guys are fine as well. How have you all
[273.77s -> 279.22s]  been? Hopefully great. But let's move on. We're going to talk about PAX Prime now because I'm
[279.22s -> 283.70s]  going to PAX Prime. I will be there all four days. I can't believe it's actually four days. It was
[283.70s -> 288.90s]  four days last year too, which is crazy to think about that they're going on like almost a full
[288.90s -> 295.78s]  work week, five days almost for PAX. And some people show up days earlier and stay days later.
[295.78s -> 300.95s]  And that's like almost an entire week. And it's, it's a lot, but I'll be there. I will see you guys
[300.95s -> 306.15s]  there. If you are going and you want to come say hello, please do not hesitate to say hello. I say
[306.15s -> 311.91s]  this every time a PAX comes around that I'm going to, but please, if you see me and you want to say
[311.91s -> 315.75s]  hello, please do it. Please. I'm telling you, I will sit there and we'll talk for a little bit.
[315.75s -> 321.43s]  I'll chat with you and I'll do a meetup too. Check my Twitter, probably on Sunday afternoon.
[321.43s -> 325.59s]  That's when it'll be happening. And that's pretty much all I got to say about PAX. It's going to be
[325.59s -> 329.27s]  fun. It's going to be exciting. Could you guess that's one of the things that's currently on my
[329.27s -> 333.83s]  mind right now? Probably, but that's going to wrap the video up guys. Thank you all so much for
[333.83s -> 339.27s]  watching. I really do appreciate it and take care of your pools. Take care of your pools. Make sure
[339.27s -> 343.43s]  there's no like algae growing at the bottom of your pool. Cause then you got to get that vacuum
[343.43s -> 346.39s]  and you got to scrub with them. It never really works that well scrubbing like the
[346.39s -> 349.67s]  vacuum at the bottom of the algae and the, and then there's like the bugs that get in there.
[349.67s -> 354.15s]  Get those bugs out of that pool. Get the bugs out of there. I mean, that's gross. Nobody wants those
[354.15s -> 357.83s]  little bugs in the pool. And hey, before you come in the pool, just step in that little gross bucket
[357.83s -> 363.75s]  of water to wash your feet up. By the way, before this video ends, what is that? How come that,
[363.75s -> 369.99s]  why do we have that bucket of gross like sewage water that never seems to get cleaned that you're
[369.99s -> 376.33s]  supposed to step into and then go into the pool? That's like, that's like making you more dirty
[376.33s -> 382.49s]  before you get in the pool, isn't it? Like somebody clean that fucking sewage water. It's disgusting.
