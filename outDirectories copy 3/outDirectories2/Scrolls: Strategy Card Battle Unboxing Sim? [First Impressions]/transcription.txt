[0.31s -> 14.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with scrolls. This is a brand new game. It came out today
[14.70s -> 17.24s]  Well, actually it's not really released yet
[17.24s -> 22.48s]  It came into open beta today and it's the new game by Mojang. You guys might know that name
[22.48s -> 24.26s]  It's the guys that made minecraft
[24.26s -> 31.46s]  This is their second real release of a game that took a lot of studio time that they're currently in active development with
[31.46s -> 33.46s]  And I've been having a ton of fun with it today
[33.58s -> 38.92s]  It's it's 20 bucks and it's not on steam or anything like that as of right now
[38.92s -> 41.10s]  It's it's it's only on the Mojang store
[41.10s -> 45.46s]  If you just go to scrolls.com you'll be able to find it. But essentially what this game is
[45.54s -> 48.06s]  it's a combination of a bunch of different things and
[48.46s -> 52.98s]  And it's the reason why these few things are combined is the why the game is so much fun
[52.98s -> 56.26s]  So let's start with very basically the game is a strategy game
[56.26s -> 61.99s]  It's like a tile strategy game along the lines of magic the gathering where you have cards
[61.99s -> 67.43s]  You have to tap resources with the ultimate goal of destroying the five
[67.71s -> 71.39s]  Totems or idols on the side of the map that you do not own
[71.55s -> 78.26s]  So the gameplay is very difficult to break down in a very short like four or five minute commentary
[78.38s -> 81.22s]  But it reminds me of if you guys have ever played
[81.82s -> 84.64s]  heroes of might and magic the same type of
[85.28s -> 92.48s]  strategy tile movement in that game and the different attack damages that people have the different life pools that people have if
[92.64s -> 98.45s]  you were a fan of heroes of might and magic you will probably like this game because
[99.01s -> 101.97s]  Unlike heroes of might and magic there is no
[102.61s -> 107.73s]  Open world system you just attack people with the monsters that you have in your deck
[107.93s -> 113.21s]  Kind of like Pokemon you go against people you train against people and there's a ranked system as well
[113.21s -> 116.57s]  You'll be fighting people and trying to get higher on the rank system
[116.57s -> 121.71s]  You can trade cards with people and before I completely blow your mind here
[121.71s -> 127.98s]  I want you to sit down relax for a second. Take a deep breath and listen to the words. I'm about to say
[129.68s -> 137.42s]  There is an uncrating system in this game. Oh my god, calm down calm down. It's okay. Just calm down
[139.59s -> 146.39s]  I'm gonna tell you just just just chill out for a second. How you get cards in this game is
[147.15s -> 152.23s]  Through the uncrating system you make money by completing challenges by
[152.63s -> 159.27s]  Beating other players and by just playing the game you earn gold as a currency and what that allows you to do
[159.27s -> 166.03s]  Is it allows you to essentially unbox a crate for a hundred gold to get a random card now?
[166.03s -> 171.23s]  The random card could be a common card just a crappy kind of regular card that you already have
[171.23s -> 174.41s]  It could be a rare card or an uncommon card
[174.55s -> 178.87s]  so just the collection aspect of this game and the
[179.35s -> 185.87s]  Opening up the scrolls and seeing what you got because remember every card in this game has either a spell property and
[186.59s -> 190.65s]  Enhancement property like an enchantment property a it's a creature. It's an actual monster
[190.67s -> 192.75s]  So there's a ton of different things you could possibly
[193.27s -> 199.03s]  Quote unbox in the game and it makes building your decks that much more fun
[199.03s -> 203.33s]  And I really don't know what it is about these games. We play like TF2 this game
[203.33s -> 205.33s]  There's a couple others that have the same mechanic
[206.16s -> 212.36s]  Unboxing something and not knowing what's inside of it. It could be something terrible. It could be something really good
[212.36s -> 216.16s]  It could be something incredibly good. That's such a drive
[216.16s -> 222.38s]  I felt the same thing when I was playing Diablo 2 and you'd kill bail or Mephisto and be like, what's it gonna drop?
[222.38s -> 224.92s]  What's it gonna drop? Oh, he dropped nothing or oh my god
[224.92s -> 231.48s]  He dropped a grandfather sword that all that stuff is the reason why you it drives you to play these games
[231.48s -> 235.56s]  And I feel like Mojang Mojang everyone pronounce it however, it's actually pronounced
[235.56s -> 240.60s]  I think they're doing a really cool thing here where they're molding these genres together and they're making a skill ceiling
[240.60s -> 244.80s]  That's very high because I was playing earlier in just a quick match
[244.80s -> 250.08s]  Remember the member the game came into open beta today, and I just got absolutely smoked by the first guy
[250.08s -> 253.84s]  I played he like knew exactly what he was doing. He had a good deck
[253.84s -> 259.88s]  He'd probably unboxed a bunch of cards and it had a cool like synergy going between his cards and I got me going
[260.00s -> 262.80s]  I wanted I want to do that. I want to be as good as this guy
[262.80s -> 263.80s]  I want to build a good deck
[263.80s -> 267.04s]  I want to get good cards and it takes hold of you
[267.04s -> 272.68s]  It really does and I highly recommend you give this game a try if you're into this kind of thing if you are not
[273.68s -> 276.72s]  Into this type of game where it's very slow paced
[277.20s -> 280.72s]  Turn based strategy type card collection game
[280.72s -> 286.28s]  I would say you probably should avoid this title because there's not a huge amount of action
[286.32s -> 291.32s]  It's not like bombs are dropping down and like arrows are flying across the screen and stuff it
[291.32s -> 297.24s]  I mean the animations are very fluid. They're very interesting. They're cute to look at but I would say action wise
[297.80s -> 302.04s]  You should probably avoid this game if you're not into like the turn based strategy type game
[302.08s -> 308.40s]  But if you are and you love collecting things and you love opening crates in TF2
[308.56s -> 315.46s]  Then you probably would have really enjoyed this game and I got to give two thumbs up to this title so far
[315.46s -> 318.82s]  I haven't really run into any major issues with the game
[318.82s -> 322.58s]  I mean the only issue I have so far and it might be because I'm just pretty
[322.94s -> 324.74s]  inexperienced at this point right now
[324.74s -> 329.46s]  But the game can be very difficult especially even on the easy setting
[329.46s -> 334.32s]  I've been getting destroyed by some things and I'm getting better very slowly
[334.32s -> 338.24s]  So I'm not going to say that the difficulty is too high at this point
[338.24s -> 342.28s]  But it's very difficult you have to invest some time to study the decks
[342.52s -> 347.76s]  Know what cards do what they actually mean when you put them down and so on and so forth
[347.76s -> 351.76s]  But I'm gonna end the video there guys just want to give you a heads up that this game is now in open beta
[351.76s -> 355.80s]  You can go get it the only way you can get into the open beta is you have to buy it
[355.80s -> 361.12s]  So there is no free open beta you actually have to purchase the game, but I'm gonna wrap it up here guys
[361.20s -> 365.56s]  Thank you all so much for watching and really do appreciate it and go check out scrows, baby
[365.68s -> 368.92s]  I'll see you all next time. Take care everybody
