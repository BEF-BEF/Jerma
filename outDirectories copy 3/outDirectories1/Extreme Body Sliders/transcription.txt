[0.00s -> 19.10s]  My child, the task is at hand. You must go undercover to stop the human-dragon conflict.
[19.10s -> 21.34s]  Father, I'm not ready.
[21.34s -> 30.82s]  Silence. You've always been ready. You must live among them. Be part of the human race. Find out what it's like to be human.
[30.82s -> 32.82s]  But what if I fail?
[32.82s -> 42.82s]  Take the magical cloaking cloak. It will always disguise you as a human. Our ancestors used dragon wizardry to create the spell that's extremely strong and powerful.
[42.82s -> 45.82s]  As long as you wear this, you are safe.
[45.82s -> 46.82s]  Okay.
[46.82s -> 47.82s]  I love you, my son.
[47.82s -> 48.82s]  I love you too, dad.
[48.82s -> 49.82s]  Be careful.
[49.82s -> 56.74s]  First day. Go in. Meet a few people.
[56.74s -> 59.87s]  Good day, folks!
[59.87s -> 62.87s]  A dragon! I saw a dragon!
[62.87s -> 63.87s]  What?
[63.87s -> 64.87s]  Shit!
[64.87s -> 77.87s]  Cloak doesn't work. Dad, a magic cloak? Really? He was probably just shit-faced. Please stop hitting me with the sword. Please. We can live together in harmony, don't you see?
[77.87s -> 92.92s]  Maybe a tad on the large side for a head. Longer neck. Put his head forward a little bit. He's real perceptive. He sniffs around a lot. He really must get to the bottom of stuff. He's a private investigator.
[92.92s -> 111.90s]  And I think that's all right. I like it. Maybe a little bit bigger. Yeah, that's good. That's good. We're not going to go any more extreme than this.
[111.90s -> 115.32s]  Excuse me.
[115.32s -> 117.69s]  Welcome, child.
[117.69s -> 120.69s]  I just was wondering...
[120.69s -> 121.69s]  Stop.
[121.69s -> 124.69s]  I can't even fucking see anything.
[124.69s -> 129.95s]  It looks like I seriously took this guy's face and molded it out of clay.
[129.95s -> 138.26s]  Like, this was an art project that I did. I found out that I had to do this art project 15 minutes before it was due. And it was to make a person's face.
[138.26s -> 140.88s]  I can do better than this.
[140.88s -> 160.46s]  Why is this bullfrog person listening to this guy sitting on a park bench?
[160.46s -> 173.55s]  How can you keep a straight face right there? Would you not be scared of this?
[173.55s -> 175.55s]  You walk away.
[175.55s -> 183.05s]  See how big my arms are, dude? You have any idea how big my arms are, dude?
[183.05s -> 190.05s]  Sometimes you just gotta run. You know what I mean? Sometimes you're really going to build up that CO2 in your body and breathe it out, and you just kind of go on a little jog with your hands.
[190.05s -> 192.05s]  You know what I'm saying?
[192.05s -> 198.74s]  We've got to wrap behind this guy and do our stealthy little secret technique and get my little small sword.
[198.74s -> 201.74s]  Just get right in the back with the backstab.
[201.74s -> 202.74s]  Ugh!
[218.94s -> 220.94s]  The fucking lady's dead, man.
[220.94s -> 225.18s]  Wow. What a sicko.
[235.18s -> 237.94s]  I have some bad news, honey.
[237.94s -> 241.94s]  I accidentally backed over the cat this morning.
[241.94s -> 245.94s]  It's okay. He's in high spirits. He's still alright.
[257.80s -> 265.78s]  You know, I actually thought I was going to have way more to say about this.
[265.78s -> 269.83s]  This is a cat riding a horse.
[269.83s -> 272.83s]  I'll see you next year when this is a Disney Pixar movie.
[275.78s -> 279.78s]  You foul humans. We have every right to go through this tunnel.
[279.78s -> 282.21s]  You can't stop us.
[282.21s -> 285.58s]  Well, you've never seen a cat riding a horse before?
[285.58s -> 288.26s]  Get cultured.
[288.26s -> 292.26s]  Oh, shit. The fucking Thanksgiving turkey's on the loose.
[292.26s -> 294.50s]  Everybody watch out.
[294.50s -> 297.96s]  Hide the women and children.
[297.96s -> 299.96s]  No sudden movements.
[299.96s -> 302.96s]  Nothing crazy. I just gotta run my meat shop.
[302.96s -> 304.96s]  I'm doing well for myself.
[304.96s -> 308.96s]  I don't have to be concerned that there's an evil Gumby behind me.
[308.96s -> 310.96s]  Could be much worse.
[310.96s -> 314.58s]  Just don't let him know that you're afraid.
[314.58s -> 316.58s]  And everything will be okay.
[316.58s -> 329.54s]  This is a Dark Souls game.
[329.54s -> 332.90s]  What Dark Souls boss did I make?
[332.90s -> 335.90s]  Shoot to the arrow. Shoot me right in the penis. Good job.
