[1.21s -> 13.94s]  Hey, how you doing? Welcome, everybody. Welcome back to live. I just pressed the
[13.94s -> 22.47s]  button and ran downstairs and grabbed water. Uh, let me make a tweet. We can start to play more
[22.47s -> 37.38s]  gotcha force. I'm pretty into it. I want to collect more fucking robots. No, stupid trapeze
[37.38s -> 44.89s]  simulator. I didn't even. Okay. I'm going to be honest. I forgot. I, I, I completely didn't even,
[44.89s -> 53.22s]  I forgot everything. I hit the stop streaming button and instantly it deleted from my brain.
[55.22s -> 61.21s]  So what, what do you, what are you talking about? Like, can you guys somebody be specific with me?
[67.69s -> 76.73s]  Like what, what is there a certain website? Is it a gone steam or is it a, are you serious?
[82.42s -> 95.99s]  What it's on Reddit trapeze simulator Reddit. Okay. The number one. Okay. When I type in trapeze
[95.99s -> 108.04s]  simulator Reddit, the first search is Jerma promises to do trapeze simulator. Uh, what,
[108.04s -> 116.57s]  what is this? I know the first, okay, let me just go to this promises to do trapeze simulator. Okay.
[116.57s -> 129.05s]  So what is it that when I type in trapeze simulator, there's nothing here. It's just,
[130.89s -> 135.69s]  I'm the third result. When you type in trapeze simulator, I'm the third that this, that exact
[135.69s -> 148.17s]  thing is the third result. And then there's this real simulation. It's like a, an EU right here.
[148.17s -> 157.64s]  This is not even real. Okay. Well, all right. It's excuse me for thinking it was real.
[158.36s -> 165.24s]  Like this game has released 500 times as different things, different objects.
[165.24s -> 174.07s]  So how would I know this was fake? Replace the word trapeze with another weird, hard to hold
[174.07s -> 220.36s]  on to object. And that game has been made. Anyways, I got, I got to tweet that. Okay. Also,
[220.36s -> 225.08s]  I have a, I have something to tell you yesterday. We talked about this a little bit, but I'll give
[225.08s -> 231.30s]  you a little bit more details. Uh, there's a few things to talk about here. Uh, things talking
[231.30s -> 236.10s]  about number one, they may even be showing themselves right now. We do have new, some new
[236.10s -> 242.58s]  mods as of right now, I believe there are three new mods going through the process of adding mods,
[244.34s -> 253.10s]  mod apocalypse four. That's right. Yeah. Four, four. There are four new mods. I did this yesterday
[253.10s -> 261.19s]  and I don't even know. Uh, so we got, they're going to be a lot more of a presence of they'll
[261.19s -> 271.45s]  catch you. Oh, no, no, they'll catch you now. Uh, also on top of that, welcome them there.
[272.09s -> 276.66s]  There's been a process to bring some more on and we're not quite done.
[278.18s -> 284.42s]  Still some people would think we're going to be bringing on two. Besides that, also,
[285.46s -> 303.02s]  I'm pleased to, to announce to you right now that, um, on, on, you ready? On May 15th
[303.90s -> 315.02s]  and May 16th, Easy Bay Govan stream and green screen DLC free back to back a couple of weeks
[315.02s -> 330.44s]  from now. It has been confirmed has been locked in. That's my birthday. Happy birthday. I can't
[330.44s -> 336.23s]  wait to do like a special birthday thing in front of the green screen. Why? That's a suggestion,
[336.23s -> 342.02s]  right? Is it a suggestion to like come in and it's your birthday and I'm like here for your
[342.02s -> 346.55s]  birthday and I can sit down and I enjoy your birthday. I mean, I've got, I have to give you
[346.55s -> 351.30s]  everything possible. Like, Oh, I want, I've always wished German was at my birthday. I'm going to
[351.30s -> 356.28s]  green screen myself celebrating your birthday and singing and stuff. And you can just, I'll,
[356.28s -> 361.00s]  I'll open my mouth in a weird way so you can literally just put any, any name there.
[363.37s -> 367.96s]  Like, I'll be like, Hey, and like open my mouth, Steve, you can do whatever you want.
[370.33s -> 383.00s]  Parasocial relationship. I was going to record myself just pretending to be your friend for like
[383.00s -> 390.04s]  three hours. I'm sitting, we're going to sit in your room together. We're going to watch TV.
[390.04s -> 394.84s]  How about this? All right. I will, I will green screen myself reacting to the entire
[394.84s -> 399.27s]  Witcher Netflix series, right? Like you won't be able to, it'll just be keyed.
[399.83s -> 404.23s]  It'll just be reacting off screen and you can queue it up. So then it could be like,
[404.23s -> 408.63s]  you know, I'm sitting there hanging out, just keyed into your living room while we watch the
[408.63s -> 418.14s]  Witcher three, the Witcher's entire sequence together. How fucked up would that be?
[419.40s -> 423.48s]  Rift tracks? No, no, no, no, no. It would just be me just hanging out in your living room with you.
[424.12s -> 434.12s]  We're just watching the Witcher on Netflix. That's, that's, uh, that's a probably a bad idea.
[437.56s -> 441.88s]  Well, there's a really hard TV show. Are you making a joke and a reference that the Witcher
[441.88s -> 449.74s]  three is like bad game or something? This is not a joke. Not stop. I know you, you will be kissed by,
[449.74s -> 460.23s]  by a love life. If you repost this four times in stream Lego Lord of the Rings. All right.
[460.87s -> 468.60s]  Let's play. Let's play. Uh, new mods. Shut it down. Hey, we got four new mods. Hey,
[469.24s -> 479.32s]  shut it down. Hey, those, those new blades need to be, need to be used, right? They're brand new.
[479.32s -> 485.75s]  They just came out of the blacksmith. Oh, swords. They haven't been touched. There's still this,
[486.79s -> 493.59s]  those new swords. All right. Come on. Come on. VR Josh. Uh, you haven't even peeled the plastic
[493.59s -> 499.82s]  off yours yet. Come on. Come on. Let's go use them. I know. No, but I want to leave the plastic
[499.82s -> 503.26s]  on as long as I can. Cause I, I want it to be like new and I want to take it, just take the
[504.14s -> 518.39s]  peel plastic off. VR Josh left. Oh, well, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Oh, I see how it is.
[522.25s -> 532.49s]  All right. Let's play. Welcome back everybody. That was a vehicle. Very. Yeah. I can't help it.
[535.19s -> 541.42s]  He got it from me. You know, we, we hang out so often that he's, you know,
[541.90s -> 545.10s]  the other way around. What do you mean? We hung, we hang out so often that like, I just kind of do
[545.10s -> 554.84s]  some of his things. I got it from him. Full desk. Thanks. Hey, wait, what's on this desk?
[555.40s -> 566.39s]  There's a game cube. There's a TV changer beeper, two game cube controllers, block. Eh, kind of,
[566.39s -> 574.06s]  that's kind of a boring desk actually. No, I don't want to do verses. I'd say that's so cool
[574.14s -> 590.04s]  that you could do that though. Eraser is kind of pog though. Yeah. Veto the game. No, it's not
[590.04s -> 598.63s]  going to happen. It's not going to happen. Not going to happen. I love this game. I'm going to
[598.63s -> 611.05s]  play this shit out of this. It's just not going to happen. Let's take a look at our force. All
[611.05s -> 618.30s]  right. Well, I got to figure out what I was doing. Play mega man legends. This game actually is just
[618.30s -> 631.08s]  plays exactly like mega man legends, except it's got dashes and dodges and toys. Lisa,
[631.08s -> 638.26s]  the painful waiting room. All right. I don't know. I don't know how many times I have to say
[639.38s -> 647.93s]  I am not. Can you? All right. I'm sort of green. All right. I was going to green screen myself
[647.93s -> 653.83s]  playing all of Lisa, the painful and like you can just sit in your living room and we'll play
[653.83s -> 661.38s]  it together. It's going to be a long green screen stream. It's going to be like 12 days long. Okay.
[662.10s -> 680.97s]  Now let's go. Who do I want for support? Nana. Why do that when you can just play it? Because
[680.97s -> 688.46s]  I want to be in your living room. I want to be in your living room. I got to get this right.
[691.98s -> 701.66s]  It's Jerma in your living room. I'll be in your living room tomorrow afternoon. You and me having
[701.66s -> 708.84s]  so much fun playing Lisa, the painful. So if you're into playing Lisa, the painful,
[708.84s -> 727.02s]  then by all means join me tomorrow in your living room. Greg. Combine is going to be in my house.
[727.02s -> 734.73s]  Now he's actually going to do it. You know, dumb like that makes me laugh, but like I can't,
[734.73s -> 739.21s]  I can't do that in front of the, but that wouldn't make it. I can't, that would take too much time.
[740.09s -> 743.27s]  What's a really, really short game that I could beat in like 30 minutes?
[744.73s -> 751.46s]  No, that's, I'm not doing this. By the way, this character is so much better now.
[753.82s -> 769.21s]  It's like, it's unbelievable how much better he is. I missed bits, big bits, big bits. Uh, yeah,
[769.21s -> 778.42s]  you're right. $5,050 from phylactery lich. That's a huge amount of money. Thank you again for like,
[778.42s -> 787.98s]  essentially what has turned into about $50 a day or a stream. It's insane. You're insane.
[787.98s -> 792.39s]  It's so much money. I can't even believe you still give me this much money.
[792.39s -> 802.33s]  Thank you. It's crazy. I can't, I can't even believe it. I say, don't you ever stop playing
[802.33s -> 806.73s]  gotcha force. If you haven't figured it out, the yellow icons on the map are side missions
[806.73s -> 812.97s]  and the orange ones are important. I'm not gonna know. I'm, I've liked this game and I'm going to
[812.97s -> 818.84s]  play it. I, I ain't going to get beautiful Joe bullied out of this one. Nope. Cause beautiful
[818.84s -> 825.80s]  Joe was, uh, like $11 and this one was 250. I ain't going to get bullied out of this one.
[825.80s -> 835.40s]  Nope. Not a chance. Not a chance in health. And this is one of my like favorite game cube
[835.40s -> 849.54s]  game. Yup. No way. I'm going to beat the shit out of this game. He loves this game. I do. It's
[849.54s -> 857.70s]  just fun to play. And that's what matters. Are you having fun playing? Don't worry. I'll, I'm,
[857.70s -> 861.06s]  I'm going to record a green screen for every game you've ever wanted me to fucking play in your
[861.06s -> 866.07s]  living room with you. I don't, I won't even need to stream anymore. I'm just going to green screen
[866.07s -> 873.22s]  myself playing the entire steam library and I'll make a, I'll make a bot that's able to have,
[873.22s -> 877.94s]  replace every name with your name. You just put it in and anytime your name comes up, it's just,
[877.94s -> 887.16s]  it's me addressing you and I'll charge a modest fee for each video game. Hang out in your living
[887.16s -> 899.13s]  room session. I don't know, like 50 cents. That's a good idea. That would be so why not just a
[899.13s -> 906.46s]  live stream 50 cents. Yeah. You know, what you do is you, you, you call my, you call my one 900
[906.46s -> 913.08s]  number I'm going to set up, which is a dollar 80 a minute. And it's me in your living room on your
[913.08s -> 929.85s]  phone. Holy shit. Nice teleport ninja sex line. All right. Can you imagine, let's just briefly go over
[929.85s -> 940.42s]  this back when it was like four or $5 a minute. Holy shit. Can you imagine sitting on that phone
[941.06s -> 959.75s]  for more than 10 to 20 minutes? That's absurd. That's expensive. It would cost me
[960.39s -> 970.44s]  $2. I'm so glad that I have turned on the mature content filter for the channel.
[973.99s -> 988.28s]  Very necessary at this point, I think. Uh, who's the new guy? Ooh, arm cutter, double
[988.84s -> 994.84s]  Kamaitachi and then ninpo teleport and then teleport slash. Teleport's a fun one to say.
[994.84s -> 999.88s]  That's a, that's a radio word. Teleport. Teleporting. Teleport. Teleport. Because the
[999.88s -> 1007.56s]  E and the L and the E. Tele. Teleport. It's like saying W. W is a fun one to say too.
[1007.56s -> 1014.87s]  And even with a lot of consonants in the middle, they're a lot of fun. www.teleport.com. Yeah,
[1014.87s -> 1022.62s]  that's fun. That was fun to do. Confuse his enemies with his smooth moves. Use the ninpo
[1022.62s -> 1027.90s]  teleport while moving to throw them off the scent and wait for your chance and hit them with the
[1027.90s -> 1040.41s]  teleport slash. Oh, I'll try it. He's expensive though. He's 400. What can I get rid of? Eh,
[1041.05s -> 1050.33s]  I got to clean up my toy shelf. This is bothering me. Can't afford anything else.
[1050.97s -> 1058.09s]  I got to clean up my Reddit. I was going to call it my Reddit shelf in the title,
[1060.23s -> 1070.71s]  but that's just dumping more charcoals onto this fire. I'm no, I could have, but that's just me
[1070.71s -> 1074.23s]  embracing the fact that that's what that is. And I kind of don't want to do that.
[1074.23s -> 1084.14s]  Okay. Choke on the joke. Choke on the joke smoke.
[1087.34s -> 1095.03s]  Oh, this guy, I like this guy. I like the little wing thing. What does this one do? Oh shit. Is
[1095.03s -> 1101.11s]  that like just a fucking, you just don't get hurt? How does that work? You can charge it.
[1104.02s -> 1124.20s]  Oh, it's okay. It's just you phase out. Does it hurt? If I get in there, is it going to be
[1124.92s -> 1131.91s]  hard to use? Play Minesweeper. This game sucks. Sorry. My Minesweeper is not a Minesweeper.
[1131.91s -> 1145.99s]  Minesweeper. Not enough consonants in there. I don't like that one. Sorry. Oh fuck. Yeah,
[1145.99s -> 1156.62s]  this guy's not very good. Maybe you like him. What about his melee? Wasn't a bunch of flying
[1156.62s -> 1171.22s]  people. Oh, that guy sucks. He's $400. Look at how much better this dude is. And he's like,
[1171.22s -> 1185.75s]  he's $500 and still so much better. Omega LOL 400 or Omega LOLs. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[1186.55s -> 1208.92s]  Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. There's more huge money coming. Hold on. Huge money. Is this on
[1208.92s -> 1220.65s]  the Commodore? No. This is on the Nintendo GameCube. Just trying to level up my crew
[1221.37s -> 1236.89s]  so I can do the secret mission. The Nintendo ShipCube. Wow. That was clever. That was clever.
[1237.21s -> 1260.04s]  Clever one. Oh, that was satisfying, but it didn't hit. Come on. I'm gonna stop it. Stop what?
[1265.67s -> 1276.14s]  Thank you. Fairy-kun gave $50. 5,000 bits. Another $50 drop. They say, hey, Jermbo.
[1276.78s -> 1282.58s]  I'm not sure if you saw, but the Pentagon released a video showing unidentified aerial phenomenon.
[1282.58s -> 1286.66s]  That's a good one to say too. Unidentified aerial phenomenon. Thanks for giving me one of those
[1286.66s -> 1291.78s]  cool ones, which basically just means UFO. And I really want to rant about UFOs and aliens
[1291.78s -> 1303.66s]  from my fellow Redditor. Um, well, I mean, is it weird to think that because you have a flat
[1303.66s -> 1314.42s]  screen TV that aliens had to have existed? All right. Like, we went from like putting
[1314.42s -> 1320.66s]  corn in the ground to being able to talk to people through like a piece of plastic
[1320.66s -> 1328.92s]  and they can hear you 7,000 miles away. That's alien fucking technology. It has to be.
[1328.92s -> 1347.80s]  Ooh, a magnet robot minus. Somebody just wrote it all capitals. True. Oh, come on. Not another
[1347.80s -> 1354.06s]  normal night. Give me like a pro night. Give me like a hard mode night. Give me an insane night.
[1354.06s -> 1375.27s]  What's the minus? All right. Do I make like a comedy team or do I make like a plus and minus
[1375.27s -> 1383.94s]  team? All right. Well, what's the difference? Magnet scope, magnet arm and beam. Okay.
[1384.74s -> 1392.74s]  The magnet robot minus was created by the natural resources unit. His magnet scope enables him to
[1392.74s -> 1397.94s]  collect materials like, yeah, the Pokemon or mines. His beam is used to modify collective.
[1397.94s -> 1409.37s]  So what's the difference? Why are you $10 more expensive to use? Oh, I'm sorry. Why do you cost
[1409.37s -> 1419.75s]  10 more battery? I mean, I'll try. I'll try everything once each character gets one chance
[1419.75s -> 1427.74s]  to impress me. Otherwise they're going right in the fucking recycling. I got to clean this up.
[1428.74s -> 1441.27s]  Looks like shit. All right. Let's, uh, that's fine. The name is Jumaas, but fairy cone. Thanks for
[1441.27s -> 1451.93s]  the $50 and the interesting thought project about aliens. Yes. I, I, I do believe that.
[1454.02s -> 1469.93s]  I think that has to be alien somewhere. There has to be. All right. You telling me if we're
[1469.93s -> 1473.98s]  supposed to be, if we're supposed to be some kind of, all right, we're going to get a little
[1473.98s -> 1480.38s]  philosophical here. So if, if like God created man and God created earth, whatever, don't you
[1480.38s -> 1485.56s]  think he made probably like fucking a hundred of these? Why would you make just one? If you had the
[1485.56s -> 1493.94s]  power to, why wouldn't you just make like a hundred? How would you make one? Or if you were like a group
[1493.94s -> 1497.70s]  of aliens that were like, you know what, let's fucking let's blow something up and make a bunch
[1497.70s -> 1506.23s]  of cells. You would do that like a thousand times. Wouldn't you? How do I ban you? What? I'm just,
[1506.23s -> 1509.91s]  I'm just talking. I'm just, this is a thought project. This is, I didn't say, by the way,
[1510.47s -> 1513.91s]  everything I believe. It's a thought. I said quote thought project before we started.
[1516.73s -> 1522.36s]  I don't know if you, if you were God and you made this like cool, like if you made like water
[1523.00s -> 1528.12s]  and you, and you built like this puzzle that is land on earth and shit, you made like,
[1528.12s -> 1531.48s]  you made like dinosaurs and monsters and aliens, would you just get you done?
[1534.26s -> 1540.10s]  No, you would do that like a bunch of times. Like, oh, that was fun. Those of you aren't people here.
[1540.82s -> 1545.78s]  Would you paint one fucking picture? Would you make one painting and go, that's it. That's the
[1545.78s -> 1550.36s]  best one. That's the only one I'm going to do. I'll never make another painting in my whole life.
[1550.36s -> 1556.90s]  It's the best. I'll never, you, I'll never pick up tools again. Oh, you, you would just draw,
[1556.90s -> 1563.56s]  you'd create, you would make, you would, you would create. Like, do you know what do you think God
[1563.56s -> 1570.18s]  has in his office? Just a hanging picture of earth. And he's the annoying, what, people come over and
[1570.18s -> 1576.52s]  he's like, yeah, I drew that. I made that 5,000 years ago. Nice. Yeah. You tell us every time.
[1576.52s -> 1585.18s]  Yeah. And he is, his whole house is just covered in like earth memorabilia. No, you would have,
[1585.18s -> 1588.94s]  you would do this millions of times. If you had the power to like point your finger and like,
[1588.94s -> 1596.65s]  and there's a fucking giraffe. You know how many characters I made in Spore? How many hours did
[1596.65s -> 1599.77s]  you spend in Spore? Well, I guess it probably took a long time. No, it took like 10, it looks
[1600.01s -> 1606.41s]  seven days to make earth. No way. I spent, I spent, I spent at least like 25 days playing Spore.
[1606.41s -> 1618.39s]  There's no way. Just telling you, like if we're, if we're at experiment, people are like, wait,
[1618.39s -> 1627.45s]  we might be in a simulation. I don't know. Be the creationist. No, I'm just saying like this,
[1627.45s -> 1633.05s]  probably a bunch of like earths potentially, but I don't know. If you were God, wouldn't you make
[1633.05s -> 1638.33s]  like earth again, but just make people have no noses just because you, that's just, I decided
[1638.33s -> 1645.40s]  to take their noses off this time on earth six trillion. How many of you guys that are art people
[1645.40s -> 1650.84s]  here? Because I mean, I'm one of you. I'm like, I'm okay. I come from a video editing standpoint
[1650.84s -> 1655.08s]  on this. You know how many times I've like cut shit out and like redone, redone the whole thing?
[1655.80s -> 1661.77s]  Like we're probably not supposed to have hands. That was like a, that was like a first draft.
[1663.43s -> 1667.35s]  And then like God's looking down going, holy shit. Yeah. I remember that. It was my first painting
[1667.35s -> 1674.74s]  there. And look at the way they made their fucking hands. Whoa. That was so wrong. I've improved so
[1674.74s -> 1701.00s]  much on earth two million. We are the first draft. Okay. Somebody said we are the first draft and
[1701.00s -> 1708.55s]  then a sad face. This guy's actually pretty good. I actually kind of like this. I like the beams.
[1710.86s -> 1728.71s]  I like the beams. They're quality. I can see why you're worth 10 more battery points.
[1728.71s -> 1738.76s]  You're all permanently on the team. Why would you not be? This is right. Then why doesn't God
[1738.76s -> 1745.51s]  appear and yell to you? This is that what I'm saying is right. Um, do me a favor and yell to
[1745.51s -> 1752.06s]  your Sims. I don't, they're not going to respond to you. Why? Why? How come in the Sims four? When
[1752.06s -> 1761.03s]  you go, Hey, Hey, Julie, Julie, look at me. I'm up here. Fucking hear you. You'll pay for this.
[1771.72s -> 1798.22s]  My Sims talk to me sim, but Sims are not real, but, uh, we will, but how can you be so certain
[1798.22s -> 1820.92s]  that we're real? They obviously that was, Oh, finally I got a healer. Turn them off. Turn them
[1820.92s -> 1826.73s]  up. Oh yeah. We get big bits. I get it. Hold on. Oh, we did. Our luxury again, gave $50,
[1829.80s -> 1835.00s]  $5,000 more bits from phylactery, which brings it to a hundred dollars in bits today. Right now.
[1835.88s -> 1841.10s]  You say German, don't let German's alien rant distract you from the fact that he owns and
[1841.10s -> 1853.14s]  wears a crystal healing bracelet. I don't wear cry. I don't, I don't wear a crystal healing
[1853.14s -> 1858.92s]  bracelet. Oh, look, I got, I just, I have, I have a little bit of, look, I have, listen,
[1859.64s -> 1863.40s]  listen to me. Look, I look, I have a little bit of black tourmaline
[1864.20s -> 1868.47s]  because I thought it was cool. Not because I think it has magical powers.
[1868.47s -> 1877.11s]  And I paired that with some quartz to, uh, clean my blood and sift my, uh, through my kidneys and
[1877.11s -> 1882.07s]  make me have cleaner pee or something. I don't know. It was interesting. It's interesting.
[1882.07s -> 1886.63s]  I don't care. I don't think it, I don't think it's real. I don't think it's real. Look,
[1886.63s -> 1891.43s]  okay. Let me preface it again. I don't think that's real. It's just an interesting thought project.
[1892.39s -> 1903.90s]  It was, it's a thought project. Why'd you do it then? Why do people wear fucking like,
[1905.78s -> 1910.10s]  why do people wear rings and bracelets? I don't know, because they like, it's an accessory,
[1910.74s -> 1914.90s]  but I can't have an accessory. I don't think my accessories have magical powers.
[1915.86s -> 1920.34s]  I just liked the idea of having like a little accessory and like the black tourmaline looked,
[1920.34s -> 1931.16s]  it shined well and it was polished. Don't people believe, doesn't believe, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1931.64s -> 1943.66s]  doesn't believe in God, but believes in healing crystals. I don't, I don't believe in healing
[1943.66s -> 1951.35s]  crystals. I, I believe, I believe in like medicine and science. All right. Let's, let me, let's be
[1951.35s -> 1963.66s]  clear. I believe in medical science. Okay. Do I have to say that? He's, now he's a Redditor.
[1963.66s -> 1975.85s]  That's a Redditor comment. Medical doctors. Oh, he's so enlightened. Why is me saying that
[1976.41s -> 1986.42s]  believe in medicine of like an enlightened Redditor. Are you guys like smearing garlic
[1986.42s -> 2002.66s]  in your assholes? What's, what are you talking about? He's an edge lord. Oh, thank God. I put
[2002.66s -> 2009.10s]  that mature content filter on. Seems like I'm getting a lot of, a lot of mileage out of that
[2009.10s -> 2022.79s]  one. I don't, the healers, no, crashed here, crash. All right. It's time for me to,
[2024.04s -> 2040.82s]  uh, uh, Bitslave. Oh, Super Bruce. Oh, Super Bruce. Super Frog. Thanks for the 10 community
[2040.82s -> 2049.70s]  subs. Super Bruce. 10 subs and then $50 from Bitslave. 5,000 Warp Bits. What's up, Jerma
[2049.70s -> 2054.34s]  Bitslave here. I'm currently trying to pass two kidney stones at the moment. Very painful.
[2055.06s -> 2061.66s]  I also recently got my League of Legends account permabanned. Stop playing. Yeah, stop playing.
[2061.98s -> 2066.22s]  I can just start reading books. You know what I mean? Like every time you have the urge to play
[2066.22s -> 2073.00s]  League, just read like two chapters of a book or something. It's too stressful and it's going to
[2073.00s -> 2080.86s]  make you mad and angry at stuff. Uh, it caused me worse pain than my stones, not because of the ban
[2081.58s -> 2092.18s]  because of this. Oh, how much money have I spent in the League of Legends? Here's how much you've
[2092.26s -> 2099.64s]  spent in League of Legends. Oh, damn. That's a lot of money. Damn. That's a lot of money.
[2099.64s -> 2103.48s]  Should I want, you want me to share this? That's a lot of money. Play Billy the egg, by the way.
[2103.48s -> 2118.26s]  I will. That's a lot. Damn. All right. Well, this makes me feel better about how many card
[2118.26s -> 2127.21s]  packs I bought in Hearthstone. You don't have any like, there's not like personal info on here,
[2127.21s -> 2158.62s]  right? All right. Here. We're going to do a big reveal. They said, share it. Damn. That's a lot.
[2158.62s -> 2171.32s]  That's a lot. And now you're, well, take that as a damn. That's a lot of money. Uh, hey, it's all
[2171.32s -> 2179.64s]  right. It's, it's just, it's, don't worry about it. It's all good. Don't go back. Let's put it this
[2179.64s -> 2187.35s]  way. Don't go back. You know what game you can play that's free. Doesn't cost anything. It's
[2187.35s -> 2195.50s]  completely free. Kickball. It's free. Well, it's not, you're going to buy the ball and those are
[2195.50s -> 2208.18s]  like probably $5. It's fun. It's like a combination of, of soccer and baseball. Just be careful
[2208.18s -> 2213.70s]  because although the ball is very, very, it bounces easily and it's like a big bouncy ball
[2213.70s -> 2217.70s]  and it makes a cool sound. I know the sound is awesome, but just be careful. I've seen plenty of
[2217.70s -> 2222.10s]  plenty of pictures, especially teachers that used to be the picture. Cause I know that everyone was
[2222.10s -> 2226.02s]  concerned about this. The teachers would always be the picture because some kids kicked it way
[2226.02s -> 2232.10s]  too hard and right into the teacher's face. Um, just be careful. Uh, you've got to be staying
[2232.10s -> 2240.46s]  back. That happened. It just happened at least three or four times with me growing up and their
[2240.46s -> 2244.62s]  glasses. They spent a bunch of time with their glasses, putting the glasses back on. It's like,
[2244.62s -> 2255.29s]  holy shit, this got rocked. Just be careful. It's gonna be dangerous, but it's fun. I'm supposed
[2255.29s -> 2282.47s]  to be playing a game. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. Remember was a delinquent. What? No, we want more
[2282.47s -> 2299.50s]  rants, more rants. No, I don't even know. I don't, I'm not even ranting. I'm doing a thought project.
[2300.06s -> 2318.62s]  That's such a Redditor thing. I, this thing is, I don't, how do I kill this thing? How do I like
[2318.62s -> 2328.22s]  bury this Redditor thing? How do I do that? I know I have to have something else even more ridiculous
[2328.22s -> 2343.13s]  and embarrassing happen so that you forget about the Redditor thing. Okay. I'm going to like take
[2343.13s -> 2345.93s]  a picture of, I'm going to have like a picture of, I'm going to turn the camera on one day and my
[2345.93s -> 2349.69s]  mouth is going to be full like hot dogs and like marshmallows. And I'm going to be like,
[2352.17s -> 2355.05s]  and be, I'm going to be like, I'm the Marshmallow Man, I'm the Marshmallow Man. And people are going
[2355.05s -> 2358.33s]  to be like, holy shit, he's fucking crazy. And then they, you'll, that'll be all you talk about
[2358.33s -> 2387.56s]  for like six months. Perfect. 12 year old. Dude, I love this guy. He's got a sick move. Tom Green.
[2396.02s -> 2401.35s]  I have hot dogs in my mouth. I'm a hot dog man. I have marshmallows in my mouth. I'm a Marshmallow
[2401.35s -> 2405.99s]  Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man.
[2405.99s -> 2407.91s]  I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man.
[2407.91s -> 2417.75s]  Yeah. I mean, that's funny. It was funny. It was kind of funny. I'll tell you one of my favorite,
[2417.75s -> 2424.07s]  the absolute best thing that I've ever seen Tom Green do. He did his show back on MTV. He was
[2424.07s -> 2428.87s]  like a weird, wild guy. He did all kinds of crazy shit. But this is the, my favorite thing that he
[2428.87s -> 2433.75s]  ever did. Not like, wow, remember when he went and he like smashed the calculator? Remember when he
[2433.75s -> 2439.91s]  like peed his pants? No. He's sitting on a bench next to this old woman who's holding a cup. You
[2439.91s -> 2446.15s]  can't see what's in the cup. And he continuously is interviewing this old woman. And he goes,
[2446.15s -> 2451.91s]  hey, I'm sitting here having, enjoying a nice Mountain Dew. And she's like, no, it's just a
[2451.91s -> 2456.79s]  water. And she starts laughing. And he's like, oh, well, I mean, I'm sitting here. You're having a
[2456.79s -> 2460.55s]  great time. We're hanging out on this bench. You're enjoying your Mountain Dew. And she's like,
[2461.51s -> 2466.55s]  no, it's a water. This is a water. And he's like, oh, wow, what a refreshing Mountain Dew.
[2467.83s -> 2474.54s]  That seriously was like, I thought it was the funniest thing ever. I thought it was really
[2474.54s -> 2481.34s]  funny. Show it. By the way, you can't find this. I've already looked for it. I've already searched
[2481.34s -> 2487.26s]  for this. I've typed in like Tom Green, Mountain Dew, Tom Green, sits with old lady on bench.
[2487.26s -> 2502.89s]  It doesn't exist. It's gone forever. I didn't, I know I did not imagine it. It was the Mandela,
[2502.89s -> 2509.99s]  Mandela effect. No, no, no, this happened. And then he keeps going. Do you like the way I dance?
[2510.63s -> 2514.95s]  Do you like the way I dance? And she's like, get out of here. This is water.
[2517.78s -> 2521.85s]  Wait, you got it? Wait, how did I not find this? When was this uploaded?
[2522.49s -> 2534.82s]  No, this is fucking not even it. You're liars. This is when he's doing the daddy, would you like
[2534.82s -> 2540.50s]  some sausage thing? And was, yeah, no, here, here, here. It's not it. I've looked, trust me.
[2541.46s -> 2548.20s]  I seriously have looked for this. Tom Green, delicious soda. Wait, is this the delicious
[2548.20s -> 2556.92s]  soda? No, this is not it. This is not it. This is, it's an old lady on a bench.
[2557.64s -> 2570.86s]  This is not it. Oh no, this is important. Is this it? This is it. Tom Green, delicious soda. No,
[2570.86s -> 2587.40s]  it's an old lady sitting on a bench. He dreamed it. You imagined it. No, I didn't. It's combined
[2587.40s -> 2618.01s]  memories. No, no, it's not. No. No, it's not it. Did you find it? This is it. Somebody got it.
[2624.04s -> 2662.82s]  No, this is not it. What, what, is this it? No, it's not. No. I'm telling you, I looked at this
[2662.82s -> 2688.14s]  for like six years. You guys are wrong. Is it mixed memories? Here's a script. Hold on,
[2688.14s -> 2706.60s]  there's a script for it. Here's the script. Okay, I have to go. It's not this one. It's a pie one.
[2706.60s -> 2712.73s]  All right, I'm going to, that's combined memories. I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
[2714.01s -> 2718.65s]  Park bench. You're just relaxing here today, enjoying a cigarette and a glass of Mountain Dew.
[2719.85s -> 2726.89s]  That's water, I'll have you. No. Do you drink Mountain Dew? No. Do you drink Mountain Dew? No.
[2727.85s -> 2733.93s]  Do you drink Mountain Dew? Hey, what are you doing? Okay, I'm going to do my little dance for you
[2733.93s -> 2744.44s]  while you drink your water and then we'll go. Okay. Oh my god. There's no video.
[2753.56s -> 2754.20s]  That was the line.
[2767.13s -> 2776.44s]  There it is. Glass of Mountain Dew. All right, it was, all right, it was, I thought it was,
[2777.00s -> 2784.23s]  it was funny. I thought it was funny. I was like 15. I don't know. It's funny.
[2787.06s -> 2797.50s]  But this is the worst joke of 2020 is I didn't make this joke. I'm reminiscing. I didn't like
[2797.50s -> 2801.42s]  teleport back in time and become Tom Green and do the Mountain Dew joke.
[2804.09s -> 2818.87s]  All right, what's the team look like? Looks good. Mixed memories. All right, do I have, am I good
[2818.87s -> 2835.67s]  enough to do the, the secret one? No sound. I got you. Okay, here we go. No, it's mine. A baby
[2835.67s -> 2843.43s]  like you doesn't deserve a gotcha board, right? Kindly offered to use your gotcha board for you.
[2843.43s -> 2853.99s]  You should accept his generous offer. What are you guys doing? Stop bullying. Yeah. Oh right,
[2853.99s -> 2858.79s]  there was a video game here. Right, I forgot. It's been like 25 minutes of talking about
[2858.79s -> 2868.97s]  fucking aliens and how Tom Green was a funny reference. All right, I'm gonna, I gotta play well.
[2869.61s -> 2882.17s]  All right, it's, wait, positive versus negative. Who wins? All right, get in there and punch.
[2882.17s -> 2892.14s]  Actually, no, stay back, stay back, stay back. Ah, you got me. Punch, punch,
[2892.14s -> 2900.70s]  twirl. All right, good. I might get something good from this. I'm excited. Whoa, what the,
[2900.70s -> 2917.54s]  I thought that was my, no, it's not my ally. Remember, this hasn't, it hasn't been a game
[2917.54s -> 2927.51s]  this full time. It's just been a camera pointed at your pants. Okay, now that's funny. That would
[2927.51s -> 2932.68s]  be very funny. All right, we got some good trades going on here. This guy's gonna die.
[2933.56s -> 2951.78s]  There we go. All right, we're doing well. All right, good trades on the, on, on the negative.
[2952.42s -> 2965.56s]  Now we close it up. Thurma, your Reddit penis is out. Oh, is it? Oh, by the way,
[2966.52s -> 2974.14s]  somebody gave me a bunch of gold on Reddit. I have, I have, is that, okay, it's 200 gold a lot.
[2975.10s -> 2992.04s]  How much is that? It is, it's like an insane amount. It's 200. I don't know, somebody thinks
[2992.04s -> 3000.39s]  that's really funny that I have like a ton of Reddit gold. 200 is fucking insane. Am I,
[3000.39s -> 3004.84s]  I'll make sure I'm saying this right. Is there like other currency too? I have like three of them.
[3007.03s -> 3019.22s]  Okay, let's see. Yeah, I have 201.9k karma and 200 coins. What do I, what do I do with this?
[3019.86s -> 3035.30s]  Okay, where do I see that? Is there a way I can see how many coins I have? Reddit coins, 200.
[3040.41s -> 3052.52s]  Guys, 200 coins is worth like 60 cents. Ooh, thunder robot. You guys are telling me that I
[3052.52s -> 3068.76s]  had like $5,000 worth. Oh, okay. What is karma? Can you, all right. Why is there like a red dead
[3068.76s -> 3074.17s]  redemption thing on Reddit? Does this track like how many banks I've robbed? I don't understand.
[3074.17s -> 3084.84s]  What is karma? Ooh, hammer knight. Pretending not to know. I actually don't. I don't know what,
[3084.84s -> 3089.42s]  what that means. How high can it go? Is there a maximum it can go? By the way,
[3089.42s -> 3106.39s]  I'm glad we actually got those. How high can karma go? Reddit gold redemption. Seems pretty good.
[3108.44s -> 3116.31s]  Reddit gold redemption. Thunderwire. Ah, it's this guy. When are you going to do an AMA?
[3116.95s -> 3122.90s]  Why would I do an AMA when you can just ask any question and I will just probably answer it.
[3124.33s -> 3131.05s]  Reddit AMAs are just Jerma one guys. Like that's why I don't know why I did. There's no point.
[3131.85s -> 3138.82s]  The robot type got you board who belongs to the special attack machinery unit.
[3139.54s -> 3144.98s]  This Thunderwire shows its true power when strung between allies. Walk onto an ally to set it up.
[3144.98s -> 3163.24s]  He's a support, but they get hammer night on a POG. He's got a cool outfit on rolling
[3163.24s -> 3170.18s]  hammer and hammer shot. This got you. Borg is warrior in the night board court is a shield
[3170.18s -> 3174.18s]  and a hammer, which he can throw at enemies. Use the rolling hammer to blow away your foes.
[3175.14s -> 3187.10s]  Give him a try. Do a Reddit polygraph saying things that I don't have. I don't know what they are.
[3190.49s -> 3198.10s]  Um, okay. Who do I? We'll try the thunder robot too. They all fit. No, you're too expensive.
[3198.74s -> 3204.50s]  Or maybe you're too expensive and then we'll put a ninja. All right. I got to clean this up.
[3206.20s -> 3211.40s]  I know I keep saying that I keep opening up my closet and seeing this and going, I got to clean
[3211.40s -> 3229.14s]  this and I never do. Let's do this other one. Pro rock. What? Stop playing games in the wrong
[3229.14s -> 3245.94s]  aspect ratio. Uh, this is the game that was 480 P that's being blown up and upscaled to 720,
[3246.58s -> 3255.90s]  which is being streamed to you at what are you talking about? You want to put this in four by
[3255.90s -> 3276.62s]  three? Why would I do that? No, because it's being upscaled to 720. It'll be funny. It's too
[3276.62s -> 3286.82s]  stretched. No, it's not. It isn't. Trust me. This is how, okay. Remember this is the Wii.
[3287.62s -> 3292.42s]  So it's going through the Wii and the Wii is taking it and this is just playing a GameCube
[3292.42s -> 3308.33s]  game on a Wii. This is what it looks like. Actually, this dude's pretty good. I like the
[3308.33s -> 3322.86s]  ball. The ball, this guy's good. I think I found a character I like. That's good straight line.
[3323.58s -> 3350.46s]  Plus he kind of looks like a ninja turtle. I like him. That does a lot of damage. He's good.
[3352.12s -> 3366.01s]  Look at how good he is. All right. He does not have a combo. That's good to know. He's got a
[3366.01s -> 3379.05s]  shield too. Look at this dude. Sorry. He did a lot. All right. Thunder. All right. So let's do
[3381.48s -> 3397.26s]  lightning zap. So now we're connected. Where are we? This has to go through an ally. He's just
[3397.26s -> 3416.41s]  spraying everywhere. How do I target an ally? Z is lock on. Well, yeah, but I can't. I'm trying
[3416.89s -> 3428.78s]  Isn't this the one that goes to an ally? Z. Hold Z. Hold Z. Hold Z. Z. Is my ally dead?
[3433.32s -> 3465.43s]  Oh, he's dead. It's all right. Let's just fucking end this. Oh shit. Nice. That's what we call
[3465.99s -> 3482.33s]  performance. Performance anxiety. No, that's called performance. Although I gotta be careful
[3482.33s -> 3491.37s]  because I don't want to lose. Oh boy. I'm going to lose. What do I have left? Oh, that's not good.
[3492.70s -> 3514.14s]  It is actually time to get serious. Oh, it's fine. Oh, you motherfucker. No, I got too
[3514.14s -> 3530.92s]  caught up in not. I don't know. This little kid sucks. This thing sucks too. I like you. You can
[3530.92s -> 3560.18s]  stay. All right. We need a heavy hitter. You. You're up. You. You go first. 4-3 or die.
[3564.49s -> 3570.41s]  You don't want it in 4-3. I have to unplug the HDMI cables. I don't even have the other cables.
[3571.05s -> 3589.34s]  All right. Here we go. Let's try this again. Do it in OBS. But then I have to recalibrate it all.
[3590.66s -> 3623.02s]  No, it's going to take forever for me to fix it. Hold on. You ready? Sure. Authentic.
[3628.57s -> 3649.77s]  You don't want it like this. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We do. What? You don't. This is like.
[3650.33s -> 3670.60s]  No, I'm going back. No, I got to. All right. I got first of all, instead of paying attention
[3670.60s -> 3682.12s]  to the putting the game in four by three ratio, I've got to win. Get this dick head out of here.
[3688.90s -> 3703.48s]  How is this default enemy beating me around 640 by 40 like God intended?
[3704.12s -> 3725.06s]  Yeah, just like God intended. Attack. Attack. All right. You got to get away. Yeah, she's
[3725.06s -> 3746.38s]  died. Got it. All right. No, how are you still alive? You're annoying me. Face cam on a riot.
[3746.38s -> 3760.02s]  No, spit. Oh, that's a riot then.
[3764.18s -> 3764.66s]  Riot.
[3770.87s -> 3772.23s]  No, don't do that. Shut up.
[3791.48s -> 3807.10s]  Come on. I got to kill you. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad. Oh, my God. These guys are
[3807.10s -> 3832.94s]  fucking killing me. Dude, dude, this is stupid. I need flyers. That's the issue.
[3833.90s -> 3847.86s]  I need flyers. Bad. I need flyers. All right. Let's move. Cool. Nice move to have there. It's
[3847.86s -> 3864.81s]  not for me to fuck. I'm just going to spam. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're
[3864.81s -> 3901.26s]  good. Shit. What the fuck keeps happening to my shitty teammate? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3901.26s -> 3923.96s]  feel my wrath. Who's saying that? Me? All right. This is it. I win. Goodbye. Ivan, Ivan, Ivan, Ivan.
[3924.84s -> 3928.52s]  All right. Well, what was everybody freaking out about? Oh, no, right. Change this shit back.
[3929.64s -> 3961.67s]  I don't like this at all. Okay. No, I can't. That hurt. But all right. I'll meet you in the middle.
[3961.67s -> 3966.04s]  Okay. I'm going to meet you guys in the middle. I'm not going to do four, three. We're not going
[3966.04s -> 3974.15s]  to do 16 by nine. We're going to do like five by seven. We're going to do a standard piece of
[3974.15s -> 4000.30s]  computer paper. Not stretching it yet. Hold on. It hasn't been stretched. Okay. All right. All right.
[4000.30s -> 4012.38s]  See? There we go. Look at that. No, that's we can all agree with this. We can all agree.
[4013.90s -> 4022.26s]  Not too far. Big. Not too far. You know, small. And it fits. It looks good. I knew somebody was
[4022.26s -> 4030.44s]  going to call me a centrist. That's fine. It's off center. Don't worry. I got it.
[4040.28s -> 4051.22s]  Ooh, a wind Valkyrie. There we go. Okay. Now everyone can be happy. I got it. It's not off
[4051.22s -> 4066.06s]  center anymore. Hold on. Maybe a little bit. Now we can all be happy. See? Now it's like not quite
[4066.06s -> 4073.90s]  four, three, but it's not 16 by nine and it's not. You guys just. That's all I need to say is
[4074.86s -> 4090.57s]  the same as before. No, it's not. Before it was the whole screen. Compromise makes no one happy.
[4092.07s -> 4097.45s]  What's that old saying? As long as both sides are unhappy, that means you came to an agreement.
[4100.39s -> 4107.99s]  Who said that? Who said that? What's that? There's a famous quote from a guy from Pasta Italiano.
[4107.99s -> 4113.75s]  No, no, no, no, no. There's like a, oh, if there's, you can tell if both parties are unhappy,
[4113.75s -> 4117.59s]  then that means something worked out. Winston Churchill said it or something.
[4120.26s -> 4124.74s]  You can tell if he did a good job negotiating when both parties are unhappy. What'd he say?
[4129.11s -> 4135.99s]  That was not, that was not, that was not Adolf Hitler. It was not Adolf Hitler.
[4138.57s -> 4142.25s]  I know it was not. I was like fucking Winston Churchill or something.
[4156.01s -> 4165.34s]  No, what? Both. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it?
[4165.98s -> 4169.98s]  A good compromise is when both parties are dissatisfied. It was Larry David.
[4169.98s -> 4179.70s]  That was Larry David. Good. Perfect. Yes. He's quoting Hitler. No, I'm quoting Larry David.
[4180.50s -> 4200.70s]  Quoting Hitler. It was Larry David. Okay. No. All right. That's it.
[4203.88s -> 4209.80s]  Oh, I love Larry David. He's funny. And it was, yeah, it was Larry David.
[4210.60s -> 4231.53s]  That's a centrist ideology. Everyone should suffer. It's a computer aspect ratio.
[4241.67s -> 4244.95s]  Holy shit, man. I can't believe, I can't believe this streamer here is,
[4244.95s -> 4255.16s]  he's just, I mean, that's, I think Hitler said this. I wanted it 4-3. I wanted it 60 by 9.
[4255.16s -> 4287.19s]  This guy's Hitler. All right, let's go. Tunnel vision? No. German's in the back pocket
[4287.19s -> 4304.54s]  of big plasma trying to push his widescreen narrative. Big plasma. Oh, but it's, it's,
[4304.54s -> 4309.67s]  but it's classic. Well, how come you don't use it for every aspect ratio then?
[4310.63s -> 4318.23s]  Put your fucking, put your monitor right now in 4 by 3. 640 by 480. Good. Wow. So good. You like
[4318.23s -> 4326.71s]  it so much. Go boot up. Go, go boot up. Go boot up TF2 and put it in fucking 360p.
[4327.67s -> 4351.08s]  Let's see how long you crack like a fucking egg. I always have it in 360. No, no, no, no, no.
[4351.96s -> 4356.20s]  By the way, I'm not talking about the people that have the Dell computer all the way at the left.
[4356.76s -> 4368.47s]  On the shelf at Best Buy. I know I've been one of those people before. That's doing pretty well.
[4376.33s -> 4382.12s]  Generic computer. Yeah, you can always tell which one it is. It's all the way to the left
[4382.12s -> 4392.39s]  and it has no specs. Just says very fast processor, Intel, Intel processor. It's just
[4392.39s -> 4402.41s]  not even a quad core. Perfect for emails. There are no graphics card in there. It's integrated.
[4402.97s -> 4423.70s]  What do you mean? What do you mean Intel in 2020? But you don't Intel. I'm sorry. I like
[4423.70s -> 4430.28s]  the company that has the clean boost technology. Makes you whites whiter and your brights brighter.
[4430.92s -> 4463.67s]  This guy is really good. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[4463.67s -> 4471.69s]  All right. All right. All right. We got some new mods here. Take that plastic off. Take that
[4471.69s -> 4488.63s]  plastic off those swords and get ready to use them. Who's our next monkey? What is it? Oh,
[4489.43s -> 4503.94s]  finally we got our upgraded ninja. I'm not sure. I don't know what's going to be in here.
[4503.94s -> 4522.01s]  It's uncertain. It's another. Oh, we can make an entire ninja party. Yep. All right. This is
[4522.01s -> 4533.05s]  ridiculous. This is disgusting to me. This is disgusting me. Well, first of all, let's read
[4533.05s -> 4547.42s]  about our new friend. Almighty type. Pretty good speed. Shuriken. Shinobi. Yatana.
[4553.16s -> 4568.17s]  Nympho. Kage. Bunshin. I'm fucking human. I'm a human. You don't sit there and like play a game
[4568.17s -> 4571.53s]  and no one's listening to you when you do it. When you just sit there and you go,
[4572.25s -> 4576.73s]  oops. Don't worry. There's not like 5 trillion people that laugh at you.
[4577.13s -> 4584.10s]  I'm just a fucking human. All right. We produce all kinds of organisms inside of us.
[4584.90s -> 4591.14s]  Did you know that at any moment right now, at any given second, there are 500 trillion living
[4591.14s -> 4597.38s]  organisms in your body, inside of your rectum and your intestinal tract and some in your stomach,
[4597.38s -> 4607.00s]  you have acid. We're fucked. Humans are gross. Right now you have a bowl of acid inside of you
[4607.00s -> 4611.32s]  in your stomach and there's pee in there too. There's a bag of piss inside of you right now.
[4611.32s -> 4615.96s]  It's a bag filled with pee and there's shit in there. You have like a big shit going down
[4615.96s -> 4632.10s]  to you right now. It's in you right now, but he's disgusting. He burped. I'm eating. Yeah.
[4632.10s -> 4637.19s]  And there's all those gross like food particles going into your stomach right now. They're getting
[4637.19s -> 4641.03s]  burned by the acid and then like humans, we're disgusting animals.
[4644.41s -> 4657.19s]  Wow. I'm playing a video game. All right. Let's wait. I can duplicate myself with this clone.
[4658.07s -> 4666.50s]  This ninja's attacks are doubly deadly. Divide and conquer. Oh, I cause you've turned into two
[4666.50s -> 4680.92s]  people. We see iPod auto. It's iPod auto. Wait, what? Why does this dog have a, I don't get it.
[4681.40s -> 4697.62s]  That's not auto. What is this? There's a dachshund with like a shirt t-shirt on. That's auto.
[4697.62s -> 4729.45s]  That's not auto. That is not auto. Why? Where did you get this? It does look like auto. Auto
[4729.45s -> 4740.31s]  has a shorter face though. Auto's face is a little, it's not as long. This is very cute dog though.
[4743.10s -> 4756.22s]  I've had auto. Show the real auto. No, I need to clean up my room. Okay. Here we go.
[4756.86s -> 4765.83s]  Okay. Look at that attack. Look at this attack damage is insanity.
[4767.18s -> 4773.16s]  Shuriken, shinobi physical attack, and then shuriken cutter. Deadliest gotcha borg in the
[4773.16s -> 4778.52s]  assassination unit. The big shuriken on his back is made of extremely heavy, durable metal
[4778.52s -> 4794.71s]  so it can slash through anything. Well, let's make our team. I want you first. Okay. I want,
[4795.51s -> 4801.90s]  I like ball. I like the shield and ball. Oh yeah. We got this wind Valkyrie. Didn't we just get
[4801.90s -> 4810.63s]  wind Valkyrie? Probably one of the fastest characters in the game. Butterfly fan, magic
[4810.63s -> 4816.49s]  shot, big fan and fly. This angel borg enjoys flying and even sleeps while floating in the air.
[4817.13s -> 4820.89s]  The winds blowing through the mega borg planet are created by the wind Valkyrie.
[4822.97s -> 4831.08s]  Big fan. Oh, we'll give her a try. All right. Let's get this squared away here.
[4831.80s -> 4850.22s]  We're going to do the ninja unit up top. Yo, you too. I want you in here. All right. Where's,
[4851.10s -> 4859.80s]  we got flying figurines over here. What's this one? What's this one, two, three? What's this? I
[4859.80s -> 4873.14s]  don't get it. Why are these here? Robots are going to go down here. We're going to have robots. We're
[4873.14s -> 4887.42s]  going to have knights. Okay. Robots down here. Knights will be here. Oh, this is a ninja,
[4887.42s -> 4897.10s]  but I don't want you on my team. All right. This is a Kung Fu master, kind of like a boxer.
[4897.10s -> 4914.30s]  All right. Well, you go up here. Press Y to sort. Borg list. No, menu, change force name,
[4914.94s -> 4927.03s]  the lead of force. Borg list. Press Y to sword. No, you can't sort like that. We need a new force
[4927.03s -> 4935.82s]  name. We don't know what we want permanently. I can't ask the wait. We'll do, okay, flying over
[4935.82s -> 4949.26s]  here. Who else can fly? Fly. Okay. Then we're going to have knights and melee characters
[4949.90s -> 4971.69s]  underneath. Okay. Melee character. And then we're going to do it by cost. This is technically not
[4971.69s -> 4980.74s]  a melee character. It's just a robot. Okay. Claw bot. Okay. Here we go. We're going to have
[4980.74s -> 4996.15s]  shooter characters after this. Claw robot under robot. I like you better. So you go here. Oh,
[4996.15s -> 5008.78s]  melee. Oh, sorry. Melee playing favorites. Yes, I am. What are you? Okay. Gunner. Guns. Guns.
[5009.82s -> 5023.06s]  Spinner girl. Uh, kind of, I don't know. Miscellaneous. Where am I? These are people
[5023.06s -> 5031.67s]  that just shoot shooters and then miscellaneous and support will go over here. I don't know what
[5031.67s -> 5042.66s]  to do with you there. And now I actually have like a decent, decent now. What is this for?
[5043.38s -> 5053.54s]  I'm going to take you for a ride. I'm going to take you for a ride.
[5062.44s -> 5071.99s]  You're just powerful. You go like, okay, it's clean now. I can actually take a look and see
[5071.99s -> 5079.56s]  this is the ninja category. This is the, what are you doing up here? This is a shooter category,
[5079.56s -> 5088.79s]  robot category, flyer category, melee category, and then support category. Perfect. All right.
[5089.88s -> 5098.47s]  So I want that's pretty much. Oh, no, I can do 350. Who, who, who, who? Tell me. I don't know.
[5098.47s -> 5111.80s]  I don't know. I don't know, man. Who? This guy, I don't just get a raid. All sham, no wow. What's
[5111.80s -> 5122.97s]  going on, dude? Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. Hope you're doing well. Welcome to
[5122.97s -> 5128.70s]  the fucking channel. All sham, no wow is a really, really good dude. It's been a while since we've
[5128.70s -> 5138.39s]  talked. Let's change that. Here's my phone number. Five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five,
[5138.39s -> 5146.78s]  five, five, five, five, five, five, five. Good work. Hit me up on discord, man. It's been a while.
[5147.42s -> 5151.06s]  Do I even have you on discord? I don't think I do. What a fucking bad friend.
[5151.78s -> 5169.80s]  But welcome. We're playing gotcha force, a game about robots and toys and people love it.
[5170.52s -> 5180.74s]  Trust me. Who should I put in the last swap though? Don't tell them how much it costs.
[5181.38s -> 5190.30s]  They don't need to know that. Maybe just a regular night. Yeah. Two regular nights. Oh,
[5191.34s -> 5206.12s]  oh, he said there's a big team. Okay. We're good. He's not forcing us to like it.
[5207.34s -> 5217.83s]  I'm not forcing anybody to like anything. This is a completionist dream. Yes. I believe the game
[5217.83s -> 5225.27s]  never ends either. It's somebody said that it goes to infinite new game plus, but please give it a
[5225.27s -> 5231.45s]  three out of 10. Can't believe that missed a great game. All right. Let's check this dude out. He's
[5231.45s -> 5245.08s]  got 30, 30. That's a lot of ammo spots. All right. Kind of cool. All right. His, his huge
[5245.08s -> 5257.88s]  cosplay foam is getting in the way. I feel like this dude would have trouble crossing the blizzard
[5257.88s -> 5275.58s]  state. Whoa. This guy's actually really good. Let me try to get that. Did you just see how much
[5275.58s -> 5293.02s]  damage that did? This dude's fucking insane. Oh, he's got a really good movement too.
[5293.74s -> 5312.98s]  Kind of hard to catch up to a plane. Whoa. I just like flying squirrel. God damn it. All right.
[5312.98s -> 5327.74s]  Just hit the ally. Do something. Oh, I just got bombed. That shreds. It shreds people. He's dead,
[5327.74s -> 5337.85s]  but it shreds people. All right. What about this dude? Okay. I think I have to charge it and I turn
[5337.85s -> 5355.27s]  it to two. Whoa. Two bombs. This is awesome. How is it last? All right. Elastic. Let's do it again.
[5355.99s -> 5377.02s]  You have to stand still though. That's not good. Bam. Come on. Double. Oh, I was so fun to sit
[5377.02s -> 5387.02s]  there and hit that button over and over again. I'm sorry. He's slow as shit. I'll get him double
[5387.02s -> 5405.75s]  melee attack. Let's go. No, let's not do that. Actually. Let's not do that. Run away. I don't
[5405.75s -> 5413.56s]  think I can replace these guys. Oh yeah. When you get like at least 40% of them to hit.
[5415.66s -> 5419.82s]  One issue with these guys is going to be bad is when this thing's moving around very fast
[5419.82s -> 5444.38s]  and you cannot charge that up and stand still. He's got a lot of health. All right. He's going
[5444.38s -> 5448.62s]  to be. Look at that bar. He's going to be a huge chunk of that bar. His health is probably like
[5448.62s -> 5453.48s]  500. Yeah. Look at that. One more guy. It's not a tank. All right. Let's see if we can dance
[5453.48s -> 5473.02s]  around you and slash you up a little bit. Oh, how did you do predicted my movement?
[5473.66s -> 5488.68s]  There we go. I just double tapped him. These dudes have so much health.
[5493.48s -> 5495.80s]  Oh, now I got him in the corner. You're fucking screwed.
[5496.60s -> 5518.50s]  There was resolve has been tested. He's paranoid. Cool. All right. We have this is the next. This
[5518.50s -> 5524.54s]  is the story mission. Make sure we're going in with what we want. I didn't even use this character.
[5525.18s -> 5529.02s]  I like them both. All right. This is an important mission. So
[5529.90s -> 5538.26s]  I'm going to have to use the things I like. I think that too many ninjas in a row spread
[5538.26s -> 5559.08s]  them out a little bit to 410 points. That's kind of, uh, use the teleport ninja. Yeah, I guess.
[5560.44s -> 5566.06s]  I wouldn't teleport kind of doesn't make any sense to me. You could use spike head.
[5566.70s -> 5573.70s]  Now he's 470. I could take out. I'll try it. I'll try it, but I want to break it up a little bit.
[5574.50s -> 5579.03s]  No, it can't just be quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. These guys are all just quick and weak.
[5579.83s -> 5596.54s]  I'll try it. What is awesome. Yeah. I'm just kind of cooperate with us. I get to beat the ICBM tanks.
[5605.67s -> 5628.60s]  Looks like a pretty good team. Beat enemy. Gotcha. Borgs. Yes. Oh, it's hitting the lip.
[5629.48s -> 5652.50s]  No. Oh, well, you got to get over there, man. How do you avoid that? Quick, quick, quick. Get it.
[5652.50s -> 5658.04s]  Get it. Get it. Get it. Don't let him do it. That's a jump. Where do I go? Teleport out of it.
[5658.68s -> 5671.61s]  Teleport. Do I, can I get one of these tanks? I think I'm going to die. I just have to jump.
[5672.17s -> 5692.62s]  Oh shit. One didn't hit me. Die. Die before it kills us. Holy shit. I got it. You definitely can
[5692.62s -> 5712.66s]  get that nuke, by the way. No way you can't. All right. Let's keep it up. Crash Course, part two.
[5714.52s -> 5736.82s]  You can get everything, even the dragons. That's so cool. Who we go for first? Over here.
[5745.27s -> 5756.55s]  That was a double. Stay in, stay in, stay in, stay in. Oh my God. This dude is as good
[5758.38s -> 5768.71s]  as Spikehead. What was his name? Boogerberry or something. Boogerberry is just Bugleberry,
[5768.71s -> 5774.38s]  but okay, you know how Snoopy has Spike and Spike's like kind of a little, like more rough.
[5776.76s -> 5795.35s]  Boogerberry is Bugleberry's Spike. Oh, it's Bogus. What? Die. I got to trade here. There we go.
[5795.35s -> 5806.58s]  It's a Bugleberry anti-hero. What do you have that for? Is it, is it a shield?
[5809.37s -> 5829.43s]  Oh, that's all right. Out of here. Stay in front so I can use the shield. One more hit.
[5829.43s -> 5843.88s]  Oh, one more hit. Turn off the music and please sing for us instead. I don't think you're gonna
[5843.88s -> 5862.90s]  want that. Oh, it's all right. We got a, okay, teleport ninja. How much damage does this do?
[5871.90s -> 5877.90s]  Okay. Starting to understand. Oh, I'm starting to understand why this character is good.
[5877.90s -> 5903.06s]  Understood. All right. Nuke. Give us a nuke. Do I take donations? Um, I, you can give bits.
[5903.62s -> 5921.85s]  I don't have like a PayPal or anything though. Command girl. I gotta check my crystals.
[5921.85s -> 5943.96s]  Command girl is the best. Command girl is so good. Really? Uh, just zero attack. Defense,
[5944.04s -> 5953.93s]  shooting, and attack. Speed, beam, and buster laser. An assassin from the planet
[5953.93s -> 5958.33s]  Megaborp who was equipped with a beam gun. She relies on her weapons but avoids,
[5958.89s -> 5970.65s]  oh, she just can't, no melee at all. All right. What are you doing over here? You're supposed to
[5970.65s -> 5983.16s]  be over in the flyers. You're supposed to be down here with the shooters who, oh, get rid of you.
[5983.16s -> 5990.70s]  I know you're good. Uh, you're good too. You're also good, but I, we'll try. Yeah,
[5990.70s -> 6001.74s]  I'll take you off now. See how command girl is still doing the singing thing. No, it's crypto.
[6003.61s -> 6011.91s]  Yeah, I, I, we're, we, yes, I had an Ethereum address that I had there and it was,
[6012.47s -> 6021.37s]  hey, look, check it out. It's, you can send ether, Ethereum, crypto, and it was there for about
[6021.37s -> 6029.08s]  six and a half, seven months. That took in about, I believe, six or seven dollars worth of Ethereum
[6029.08s -> 6037.11s]  over six or seven months. So, which that's, that's fine. It's, it's not like, oh, I didn't,
[6037.11s -> 6042.17s]  nobody gave me enough money, so I'm deleting it. It just wasn't really used and I, it was just like,
[6042.65s -> 6054.76s]  people don't really care anymore. You are CNN ass streamer fucking nerd. What does that mean?
[6056.82s -> 6063.96s]  I, I'm trying, what I, why do I like, I'm like, I'm piecing together what you're talking about.
[6064.52s -> 6073.85s]  That's exactly what I just made fun of. What did I make fun of? What did I do? All right,
[6073.85s -> 6094.07s]  this is going to be a hard fight. Okay. I probably shouldn't have started with, uh,
[6095.78s -> 6101.90s]  with vacuum cleaner girl, whatever that is, with big boxing glove vacuum.
[6105.24s -> 6116.98s]  Oops. Well, we got to fight five people at the same time. No, she definitely doesn't suck. I just
[6116.98s -> 6136.70s]  can't, you know, I'm fighting a full team. I'm hitting somebody. These motherfuckers can't even
[6136.70s -> 6147.91s]  take me down. I'm doing some good damage. Get out. Sorry, I did a lot of damage. All right,
[6147.91s -> 6168.54s]  clean it up. Good. Focus, focus, focus on them. Don't let them get away. This is your time to
[6168.54s -> 6187.88s]  shine. You just transformed, but he's dead. Oh, you just keep his own guy. Yeah. Your teamwork
[6187.88s -> 6230.49s]  is not. All right, let's go. Come on. One hell. Oh, all right. That was a bad team for this.
[6230.49s -> 6252.55s]  Show us your J O crystal. I don't know what that is. CNN player. Okay. We're going to change this.
[6253.19s -> 6273.34s]  We need beef. Okay. Uh, you're good, but not now. We need beef. Uh, bubble night did pretty good.
[6273.98s -> 6291.21s]  You did all right, too. You can stay 230. Who can I put in? No, I need beef. I'm going to regret
[6291.21s -> 6320.18s]  this, but here's your one shot. Look at the crystals. Confirm. All right. And one, two, one,
[6320.26s -> 6330.74s]  C. Damn. I need one more. Oh, and one, two, one, B and one, two, one, C.
[6331.78s -> 6349.43s]  I need N one, two, one, a, and I get this thing. Damn it. Oh, well, go and get it.
[6350.07s -> 6359.94s]  That's easier. All right. We're giving hatchet night a chance here. I take you off and I had
[6359.94s -> 6366.44s]  a five 90. I didn't realize just how expensive hammer night actually was. That's insanely
[6366.44s -> 6386.41s]  expensive. Um, I can put you back in. I got two 80, three 30 or 80 double ninja. Yeah.
[6387.51s -> 6394.50s]  All right. We'll try this. You're ignoring chat. Somebody said they lost their J O crystal.
[6394.50s -> 6404.33s]  Feels bad, man. LODs support jail crystals. Feels bad, man. J O crystal. I'm, why am I ignoring chat?
[6404.33s -> 6414.17s]  Stop saying that. I'm what? First I'm ignoring everybody and now I'm addressing what everyone's
[6414.17s -> 6444.17s]  saying. And now I'm, don't stop addressing us. Run away. Oh, okay. That's what that is. Sure.
[6444.73s -> 6449.82s]  All right. Let's continue this, by the way, this, like I said, this is, this is hatchet night's
[6449.82s -> 6462.55s]  one shot. If you're a hatchet night supporter and have to see you in the chat,
[6462.63s -> 6485.94s]  this is the only shot he's going to get. All right. He's benched.
[6501.00s -> 6512.76s]  Maybe one day he'll get a shot. I got to focus on one person at a time. You,
[6513.40s -> 6520.82s]  you're dead. That's got like everybody. Look, I'm not, I look, I got a lot of damage in there.
[6520.82s -> 6553.27s]  All right. Here we go. Comes the equalizer. He instantly died. Are we about to see somebody
[6553.27s -> 6586.82s]  always have a spot on my team? Oh, there's always a spot for you. There's always a spot for you now.
[6586.90s -> 6613.06s]  Okay. Cocky double ninja always gets a spot. No matter what big bits by Lacta re even more
[6613.06s -> 6627.85s]  huge money drops. Ooh, it's like a punch guy. 50 Thomas, another 50 bucks. You're a J O crystal
[6627.85s -> 6636.04s]  is like a little talisman you use with your bros. You guys all hang out and just kind of do this.
[6636.04s -> 6648.84s]  Don't tell anyone. It's just for us bros. Okay. Thanks. This is 50 bucks. Don't tell anyone.
[6648.84s -> 6657.02s]  It's just for, okay. Well, I just told 5,000 people. Sorry. All right. We have to have a bench
[6657.02s -> 6666.30s]  category. Yeah. It's over here. This is the bench for 500. Maybe you'll come out one day
[6666.30s -> 6671.98s]  and Disney movie somebody and it'll be like, wow, he came off the bench and he sunk like five threes.
[6673.43s -> 6686.89s]  Now is not your time. And we won the championship because of that. I have not, but 570 remaining.
[6687.69s -> 6694.81s]  Kind of let me down, but I'll keep you there for now. Uh, where's put you back in here at number one.
[6695.37s -> 6713.74s]  I like this guy. Oh, command. Right. Command, command girl. Let's get rid of you. Put you
[6713.74s -> 6729.80s]  back down with the robots. We'll have two 60 normal night. Hmm. I feel like I haven't given
[6729.80s -> 6736.52s]  these big bulky robots much of a chance, but I'm not going to who's 60.
[6739.35s -> 6750.74s]  Hmm. She was kind of good. She was all right. You need an ally though, or maybe a flyer. Yeah.
[6750.74s -> 6756.04s]  Okay. We're going to try wind. Yeah. We didn't do wind Valkyria.
[6762.33s -> 6792.92s]  Take multiple teams. I will. When I have 500 robots, I tweet this. Yeah. Don't forget to press
[6792.92s -> 6803.00s]  fucking X. Yeah. Well, I, I was going to get five people at the same time. Oh, it's okay.
[6804.44s -> 6840.07s]  You can just stay way back. I now see the appeal. You can't even get over here. All right. I got,
[6840.07s -> 6847.58s]  I don't know why I just got cocking, but in close, you're a camper. Yeah. That's the character. The
[6847.58s -> 6870.79s]  character is a camper. Oh, all right. Let's check out this. This is the wind. What the hell does that
[6870.79s -> 6895.99s]  do? What does that do? Does this do damage? It's just knock back bench. It's going to be a nice
[6895.99s -> 6912.20s]  warm spot underneath you because you ain't ever going to get up from that bench.
[6914.39s -> 6917.67s]  You're going to be sitting on that bench for so long. There's going to be an imprint of your ass
[6917.67s -> 6941.93s]  on the metal. Command girls. Good. I'll keep command girl. And of course, a bubble bot is
[6943.98s -> 6958.74s]  always just key. Very solid player. I'm sure there's probably somebody out there that has
[6958.74s -> 6962.82s]  played this game before and is like, dude, he doesn't even understand that those, the flying
[6962.90s -> 6967.94s]  Valkyries there. So you just playing wrong. They're the best characters in the game. You
[6967.94s -> 6971.38s]  can just cheese every level. I'm sure they exist. I'm sure some three, you can do that.
[6972.02s -> 6977.78s]  But my buddy bubble bot is going to have to take that's my playing strategy. That's my playing
[6977.78s -> 6993.90s]  style. 87%, 88% dodge ratio. You kidding me? Bubble, but bubble, but yeah, my buddy bubble
[6993.90s -> 7008.09s]  bot over here. Ooh, okay. We've got two. Now here we have some benching to do. Okay. That
[7008.09s -> 7031.05s]  frees up some space. We'll put you, we'll start with you. Okay. 270. I think I want to get you
[7031.05s -> 7041.90s]  back in here though. He's like the best character I have. Who's worth putting in for normal night?
[7054.23s -> 7064.92s]  Put me in slot 24. I mean, guard witch could just be, I mean, it's just another character.
[7066.66s -> 7070.66s]  When we get to guard, which we know it's time to really try as hard as we can guard, which is just
[7070.66s -> 7088.66s]  going to die revolver gunman. Maybe, maybe one day I love revolver gunman, but you're going to
[7088.66s -> 7099.37s]  change it up. Another GF commander. Hey, GF commander, if they got you for us, you're about
[7099.37s -> 7111.64s]  to be destroyed. Uh, the guy with Woody. No, I want Woody though. Dude, you have to, you have
[7111.64s -> 7138.30s]  Woody and Jax. I want those. What the fuck? Uh, Tsutomu has an airplane now. Oh, they got a,
[7138.30s -> 7151.77s]  wait, they have a bigger airplane. I'm starting to realize why this show didn't take off.
[7156.25s -> 7168.50s]  Wait, he, that's him. All right. This is one of my best characters.
[7176.17s -> 7184.31s]  Got it. Keep up the pressure, keep up the pressure, keep up the pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.
[7194.68s -> 7203.98s]  Come on, get it. No. Okay. Good. I got to get some shots in before he gets another per, all right.
[7205.42s -> 7219.48s]  That's a something. That's a character I haven't seen yet. Whoa. I caught him in a, well,
[7219.48s -> 7239.19s]  almost an entire revolution. He thinks this will hit. Fucking idiot. Ooh. All right. Let's go.
[7239.19s -> 7251.50s]  Bubble Bot. Stay away from the giant ship right now. It's on fire. You got to, where's your
[7251.50s -> 7264.78s]  supporting fire? All right. Keep him in here. He can't get close to Bubble Bot. No way.
[7265.58s -> 7298.65s]  He just throw me. Come on. He just had a reach. Come here, girl. Wow. Check this shit out. This
[7298.65s -> 7318.78s]  is going to be crazy. Take out the big fucking ship. Is it Thanatos? Uh-oh. Who's left? Uh-oh.
[7318.78s -> 7325.43s]  Time to try hard. I have to try really hard with Strawberry Shortcake. That means try.
[7326.39s -> 7340.42s]  Strawberry Shortcake. Actually pretty good. No, we just have the big boat thing.
[7353.19s -> 7364.06s]  Okay. Okay. Here we go. We got to, we should get this, right? Stay in the air. Come on.
[7367.37s -> 7376.94s]  Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh, I thought that was me. Am I bad at this game? I'm not. I just won.
[7380.44s -> 7390.46s]  I got a 62% hit ratio, a 97% dodge ratio. That's not, what, what do you want me to say?
[7391.34s -> 7412.10s]  You got lucky. I don't know. That guy doesn't seem too serious. We didn't even get anything
[7412.10s -> 7436.07s]  for that. Bullshit. Okay. Uh, I got, I like this team. I like this team. We need the odd number.
[7436.71s -> 7451.69s]  I remember this Valkyrie was pretty good. In fact, we're going to put you in the front here.
[7452.41s -> 7465.98s]  That makes more sense to me. Eh, maybe. Hmm. Okay. That's better. 1580 exact. How did I cheat?
[7466.62s -> 7476.55s]  Did I use my superpower? Berry bubble butt or rumble. I don't know if that's going to work out.
[7477.19s -> 7487.78s]  All right. Here we go. Battle with Sho in Yu-Gi. I'll destroy them all. I don't care if they're the
[7487.78s -> 7510.17s]  death force or gotcha force centrist. I agree with that. All right. Do I use Reddit shelf team
[7510.17s -> 7533.45s]  ninja heels? Really cool. Swords. What do you inject? I'm going to use Reddit shelf. What is
[7533.45s -> 7546.73s]  that? What is that thing? Shit. I have a major, major character. I could say something right now
[7546.73s -> 7552.25s]  that looks like that is exactly what that is. Well, I can't because I know I couldn't do that,
[7552.25s -> 7557.78s]  but that's just, but there's an exact reference to who that is. And I, I, I can't say it
[7558.50s -> 7561.54s]  as a, as a, I don't even want to say what it potentially could be referencing.
[7562.34s -> 7583.34s]  All right, let's get in there. Is it slow motion field? That is slow motion field. Oh, that's
[7583.34s -> 7597.75s]  actually cool. Cause everything's slow in here. Even projectiles. I'm so focused on this dude.
[7597.75s -> 7622.14s]  I'm not even attacking the other guy. Weirdo. Yeah. He's so fast in that little bubble.
[7622.78s -> 7632.28s]  We got him. We need that power. Cause I want to be able to just to span this.
[7635.46s -> 7658.18s]  Do it. You weren't trying before. Liar. Oh shit. Okay. I can fly. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7658.18s -> 7664.17s]  Up, up, up. Get away, get away, get away. We can both fly. Oh fuck. We can both fly. Oh yeah. I
[7664.17s -> 7687.66s]  forgot this character is awesome, but I can't. Come on. God damn it. This guy's fucking insanely
[7687.66s -> 7695.45s]  powerful. You can just float in the fucking air and rain hell. How do I get one of these things?
[7706.04s -> 7726.68s]  Oh, this is bad. This is where you shine here. Counter, counter, counter. Get the fuck up.
[7734.46s -> 7765.05s]  Okay. Good. Holy shit. Holy shit. Don't get cocky. Fly away. Oh my God. Is this the last thing I have?
[7765.05s -> 7794.87s]  What's after this? I'm at the end of the world. I'm going to choke. I have to get something for
[7794.87s -> 7819.19s]  that, right? Huh? What the fuck are you talking about, kid? That's like a phrase that he heard
[7819.19s -> 7826.76s]  his parents say or something. And he's just, ah, I guess I'll say that. These kids are like five.
[7826.76s -> 7852.74s]  You get nothing. What? That's bullshit. Cultural anthropology. I'm going to keep this team.
[7853.30s -> 7864.70s]  I think it's working out. Yeah. Why change it? I'm something of a cultural anthropologist myself.
[7865.66s -> 7878.36s]  We just keep following these. Wait, I got to save again. That was funny. That was funny.
[7878.36s -> 7883.83s]  One of you guys is real funny. I read it. Uh, it's the same two people.
[7884.39s -> 7907.22s]  It's like following these guys around and bullying them. You come to get beaten by me too.
[7907.22s -> 7916.01s]  Sure. Uh, I want that's a new character. All right. Don't let me down. Don't let me down.
[7916.81s -> 7929.14s]  Nana. Oh yeah. See? Fuck. Oh, okay. I have to, I need to tell you guys what this is. I,
[7929.14s -> 7936.20s]  does somebody knows? Um, okay. At the end of the stream, I'm going to go into, uh,
[7936.92s -> 7956.39s]  discord and write it somewhere. This is good. Oh, he's not even, am I going to perfect you?
[7957.70s -> 7961.14s]  Holy shit. You're going to be, you're going to get embarrassed. I'm about to perfect this person.
[7961.78s -> 7976.04s]  Yeah. Oh, almost. Now I'm just BMing. That's enough. That's enough mortal combat for today.
[7976.04s -> 7991.19s]  That's enough mortal combat for today. Turn it off. Bye bye. What, where did you come from?
[7991.19s -> 8007.53s]  Keep up the pressure in this dude's dome. Oh, this, this, I hate this dude. This guy's the worst.
[8013.18s -> 8033.46s]  I got it. Yeah. I got to focus this dude now. Oh, not good. Get away from me.
[8035.43s -> 8059.46s]  Oh, not good. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. If I have to kill this guy, I will. What falls up must come
[8059.46s -> 8081.03s]  down. What planet are we on? Good hit. Come on. I got double teamed there. Man, you haven't healed
[8081.03s -> 8104.22s]  me one time all game. Benched. Stop being toxic. Benched. I'm not going to use this yet. Unless I
[8104.22s -> 8122.38s]  need to. Heal me. Heal me. Get over here and heal me now. Do you even have a healer character with
[8122.38s -> 8156.54s]  you? I've had enough. Finally. You did it. Fuck. No. It's not over. And it won't be. What happened
[8156.54s -> 8166.52s]  to my guy? What happened to my guy? I'm dead. I'm never using mana ever again. Mana walked around
[8166.52s -> 8171.32s]  in circles. Didn't do anything because all she has is support characters. And then injected me
[8171.32s -> 8183.67s]  with one heal over the whole course of the entire round. Benched. Permanently. He's right. I mean,
[8184.23s -> 8195.99s]  the quantum theory, whatever you're talking about. I lost the opportunity. Of course,
[8195.99s -> 8218.73s]  I picked mana for that opportunity and it's gone. Reload the save. No. He's flaming mana. Yeah, I am.
[8219.69s -> 8237.42s]  I was holding up the earth there. I'm keeping the snow. Somebody's got to go. No, we're going to
[8237.42s -> 8267.06s]  keep it. Beat the death eye unit. Ref, it's the eight-year-old's fault. Yes, it was. If I'm playing
[8267.06s -> 8273.54s]  a game with children and one of the children doesn't play well, then it was the child's fault.
[8273.54s -> 8286.36s]  I didn't do it. I have 650 points in the game of basketball we're playing. By the way, the other
[8286.36s -> 8298.04s]  team has one. They got a safety. One of them got pushed over. No, they have zero points.
[8309.82s -> 8341.85s]  Oh, okay. What? I kind of like this character. Where do I get one? Oh, come on. He jumped over
[8341.85s -> 8355.88s]  it. Did they have melee? Oh, all right. I got to kill that guy now. This is horrible. They can all
[8355.88s -> 8395.93s]  do it. Do I have to activate the superpower with this? I might. Okay. Now I remember. Now I remember.
[8395.93s -> 8412.01s]  She has one of the best spammable super moves. X, A, X, A, X, X, A. I've got a new robot in three
[8412.01s -> 8424.50s]  hours. I think I'm going to try my new combo I got. It's B, B, B, A, B, A, B, B, B, B, A, B.
[8434.22s -> 8445.85s]  This is a good heavy hitter. Oh, this dude has planes. Probably you just spam attacks.
[8453.32s -> 8467.67s]  Some of these things are so cool. I want to get satellites. You guys are so weak. Oh, man.
[8467.67s -> 8484.07s]  They're killing it. Oh, get in there. Oh, this is bad. I think I'm gonna have to bring G force
[8484.07s -> 8499.18s]  in here. What is the name? Is G red unless hold on. Why is that finding of Isaac? That's the Isaac
[8499.18s -> 8531.88s]  face. Yep. Hey, I just fly above the satellite. Done. And then watch this. Goodbye. Oh, lag.
[8532.60s -> 8560.15s]  He's so good. An emulator lag. How many satellites do you have? It's going for like a slash.
[8560.79s -> 8593.22s]  Goodbye. Oh, why did you use it? Oh, this dude sucks. All right. Don't break with the formula
[8593.22s -> 8638.34s]  here. Pac Man. Maybe that's why I like this guy. This sucks. I can't use the ability here.
[8638.34s -> 8675.46s]  No. Shit. No. Get the fuck out of here. I get up. It's too laggy. I can't move. Just get the fuck
[8675.46s -> 8703.42s]  away. Oh, shit. What do I get after this? The ninja, right? I think it's just that. I think that's it.
[8703.42s -> 8722.63s]  Oh, my fucking God. There's another one. It's bad. It's okay. This is where we just pray.
[8724.09s -> 8745.42s]  No, I didn't make two. Okay, we're good. No, there's no way I was. There's way too many.
[8745.42s -> 8769.58s]  I need to bring G red here. I need like massive artillery. You get a better ship. Fuck up.
[8770.94s -> 8781.06s]  I gotta relax. Calm down. It's all right. It's just a. All right. These are not going to happen
[8781.06s -> 8786.62s]  for you. Sorry. You're great, but not right now. All right. We need people that can
[8787.42s -> 8798.84s]  do damage from pretty far away. G red first. You're still fine. You're great.
[8799.80s -> 8808.86s]  You're good. You're not so good right now. Let's get some more of the Valkyries. Who's better? Ice?
[8809.58s -> 8822.38s]  Monado? Who does most damage? I think they both do. They all do the same damage. Will do.
[8824.38s -> 8829.51s]  What about Spikehead? I think Spikehead. I don't know if Spikehead is going to work out.
[8830.47s -> 8859.11s]  I'll try Spikehead and long range head. Yeah, I'm going to get one hit KO'd,
[8859.11s -> 8867.43s]  but that's not even his name. This Spikehead is not his name. We also need somebody that we need
[8869.83s -> 8875.06s]  artillery. Yeah. Air support, tank support, artillery, fire, big bombs. They don't move
[8875.06s -> 8895.27s]  very slow. They're slow. I got to get the way the hell up in the air. Up, up, up all the way.
[8904.14s -> 8925.64s]  Skybox. Good. Just avoid the beams. Not that hard. Stay all above them and just wait till I get the
[8925.64s -> 8944.28s]  spam ability and then just light them up. He's got a plane. He's fine. I'm hitting every single one.
[8944.28s -> 8952.47s]  They're not doing a lot of damage, but still when you can spam them, they're crazy. Almost got hit.
[8953.11s -> 8972.60s]  Okay. Here it comes. First batch. First batch of lag spam. These are EU strats. What does that even
[8972.60s -> 9000.10s]  mean? EU? And here we go. Good. Stay up. What the hell is that thing? Higher, higher, higher, higher,
[9000.10s -> 9004.58s]  up, up, up, up, up. I'm blowing. Get the hell out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[9004.58s -> 9015.66s]  What are you doing? Get out. Just get out. They're making the lasers, but they've moved too fast for
[9015.66s -> 9062.73s]  me to hit. Uh-oh. There's so many of those things flying around. Hold starting engine. All right.
[9062.73s -> 9077.22s]  Just get the fuck away while they do this bullshit. All right. Get up. Don't blow this. Come on. Up,
[9077.22s -> 9081.38s]  go, go, go, go, up. Keep going. Keep going. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,
[9081.38s -> 9102.18s]  don't. Activate the VAT system. I did it. I think I was just spamming right trigger and just putting
[9102.18s -> 9109.53s]  things everywhere. Okay. Here we go. Still have, I'm still on the Valkyrie. I was on a new character
[9109.53s -> 9133.85s]  by now. I'll get back. Yeah. I got to stick with the formula. You'd have life break from the formula.
[9133.85s -> 9150.63s]  I'm back into the corner. Get out. Uh-oh. Okay. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. I got,
[9150.63s -> 9163.40s]  I got G-Force. It's fine. He's really powerful. And in a second I can do, I can just spam the
[9163.40s -> 9189.91s]  charge. Like for instance, right now. All right. Out. Here comes the ship. Get out. Whoa. What the
[9189.91s -> 9218.76s]  fuck just happened? God damn. I'm still all right. I got plenty of health. Move. Is that it? Or is
[9218.76s -> 9235.40s]  there any more satellite? Okay. This is one or two more satellites. Oh fuck. Okay. Who's next?
[9236.36s -> 9242.25s]  It's girl. Ultra girl. Whatever her name is. Don't stand underneath them.
[9244.09s -> 9284.87s]  All right. I got to, this is where. Run. Get away from me. Do it. Yeah. Spikehead. Good choice. No,
[9284.87s -> 9303.53s]  uh, booger brain. Uh, bogus. What was it? Bogus something. Oh, you just did kid. Ship. I want to
[9303.53s -> 9313.86s]  ship. Give me a ship. I just beat the guy that has ships. Uh, it's one of those satellites.
[9318.20s -> 9336.31s]  Oh, your stupid ice cream melted. Not a bad crew. I'll keep it. I am going to go pee though.
[9336.87s -> 9344.74s]  I'll be right back. Grab yourself a new water beverage snack. I'll be back in about two,
[9344.74s -> 9600.07s]  three minutes. Okay. Let's keep going. I'm like addicted to this game. The hot battle
[9600.79s -> 9615.53s]  will bring you bring saw blades, like wacky sound effects.
[9619.14s -> 9638.79s]  No, I can't. I'm busy. I'm busy shooting, dodging that to get out a new move.
[9638.79s -> 9645.42s]  You really are addicted. Yeah, it's fun. I wanted to, I want to have a bunch of ships and stuff.
[9647.11s -> 9665.93s]  I want to play and have ships. That's what's important to me. The ships, he's going full
[9666.01s -> 9688.71s]  Shatner. What does it call Shatner? Get back in the year. All right. These guys with the explosives,
[9689.35s -> 9702.39s]  get rid of them. I've got a really itchy mouth and I don't know how to do about it.
[9702.39s -> 9729.80s]  Here we go. God damn it. Quit exploding everything. I have had enough bookcase.
[9730.44s -> 9747.83s]  I'm staying far away. Derma eight fiberglass again. What are you talking about? I don't know.
[9748.55s -> 9776.76s]  Cotton candy, giant enemy dragon. I just said joke. Oh, he did the thing. This too.
[9780.76s -> 9783.56s]  The third song, the third albums. I've been really not even as good.
[9784.44s -> 9792.74s]  So I kind of rushed. He was just trying to get it out. Like just make a bunch of sales.
[9802.10s -> 9815.56s]  Why is it going through? I know I missed the old Derma. You remember how just how much passion
[9816.36s -> 9832.94s]  there was in giant enemy spider and giant enemy spider had way more nasal pushing.
[9833.50s -> 9842.31s]  That one didn't. He just went like tiny enemy spider had like, I miss it. What happened to this
[9842.31s -> 9859.11s]  guy? It's been a long one. Fly away. There's no reason to fight these guys up close. So they want
[9859.83s -> 9886.50s]  Did I just hit with every auto attack? Oh God, it's embarrassing. He was with every auto attack.
[9887.14s -> 9903.61s]  Who's the ally? Where's the out? See later. I'm going to take a bike ride. Have fun on your bike
[9903.61s -> 9923.88s]  ride. He's been dead. Relax. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. What is it? Can I please complete one capsule
[9924.52s -> 9943.64s]  in like eight hours of playing this game? Damn it. Kneel before me. You're cool, but I want
[9944.36s -> 9952.66s]  I want this guy back. You're good too, but I want to bring in some you. Okay, nice. And I want you
[9952.66s -> 9956.60s]  here. I want you at the very end just to get something happens. And I want you first.
[9961.98s -> 9971.50s]  Back in 10 minutes. I'm going to watch beef house. Here you go. Fresh trash. What's in here? Fresh
[9971.50s -> 9997.13s]  beef. Try. I've seen a few episodes. Here we go. Do my chores. Get them done. Good. Don't leave
[9997.13s -> 10014.46s]  streaks on the windows. It's a while for them to come off if you do. Hey, oh shit. It's a, it's me.
[10019.00s -> 10032.15s]  See who the better me is. It's me. What was that? What the hell was that? That was weird.
[10036.86s -> 10044.73s]  Oh, it's a copy. It's a copier. That's really useful if you can get one of these.
[10062.71s -> 10076.47s]  How many more enemies are here? Look at that bar. I'm not going to use it with her. I got a,
[10076.55s -> 10093.46s]  I got, got you, got you, man. Whatever. Later. Don't tell him. Tell me what? Now tell me.
[10093.46s -> 10108.50s]  I want to know. What? Yeah, I know I don't. I'm focused on playing this super fun game cube
[10108.50s -> 10131.80s]  experience. Okay. Please tell me what it is. Please tell me what it is. Please tell me what it is.
[10131.80s -> 10145.86s]  Google it. I don't know what I'm supposed to Googling. Tell me what it is. Tell me what it is.
[10145.86s -> 10174.84s]  Google it. Google what? Google it. It's already too late. Oh, fine. Let me out of this, please.
[10182.06s -> 10193.98s]  Who's the person that turns you into the newts? This character is so good. Just,
[10193.98s -> 10200.86s]  he's just so consistent. He's very consistent. Slow. He has one good move, but he's consistent.
[10205.58s -> 10235.56s]  Now we press the button. See ya. Who's left? Oh, one guy. Oh, this was the audio muted or something.
[10236.98s -> 10248.95s]  I don't think it is. All right. Tell me, tell me what it is. Or I just go to random.org. Pick
[10248.95s -> 10252.87s]  a random number and every five seconds ban somebody permanently from the channel until
[10252.87s -> 10273.27s]  you tell me. Do it. Wait. We got a new robot. All right. How fast do you think I can drink this water?
[10293.98s -> 10297.96s]  See? It's terrible, but he doesn't, he doesn't need to be good.
[10299.13s -> 10306.65s]  Copy. He was going to explore planets. He duplicates his opponents and fights with them,
[10307.29s -> 10327.77s]  fights them with their own power. Very expensive. Let's try a copy, man. Now I can be a satellite.
[10327.77s -> 10339.98s]  Yeah, that's true. Does that work? Copy the giant ship. Showdown. No, that's, that's force unit.
[10340.86s -> 10354.50s]  Battle with, all right. Let's do this one. Showdown. This team's not very good, but wait,
[10354.50s -> 10360.12s]  I can copy their best hero. Who's the strongest one? Right in the middle. All right. Copy.
[10361.70s -> 10370.60s]  Copy right in the middle. Let's go. Wait, you have to throw your, you actually have to hit them.
[10379.14s -> 10397.30s]  Give me, give me somebody. Oh, this ain't going to work out. Hey, look at me. It'd be great if you
[10397.30s -> 10404.20s]  could actually, if you're not fighting five people at the same time, it works. Okay. Sniper girl.
[10404.92s -> 10419.80s]  Gonna work out. Oh, I just got caught in the air. That was bad. I can just get one of you. Just die.
[10422.38s -> 10440.12s]  Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly. Oh, yeah. We, this is not bad. As long as I kill one.
[10440.76s -> 10466.66s]  Okay. Keep going. That was holy shit. I'm going to get to stop. It's just you, right?
[10466.66s -> 10475.24s]  All right. Just the big guy. I try to jump over it. Shit. It's okay. Who's left? Oh, it's over.
[10476.04s -> 10503.14s]  I win. Well, now you're little. Sorry. All your power is gone. Who's the real cheater here?
[10503.70s -> 10513.43s]  When are you going to do another Hearthstone stream? That was a pog face.
[10516.54s -> 10525.59s]  Um, that's not going to happen. All right. Give me an, finally capsule. Let's go complete a capsule.
[10526.39s -> 10540.06s]  Do I have one of the one of these? I have so many singles. God damn it. It's like playing the
[10540.06s -> 10563.26s]  Monopoly game of McDonald's. Give me a break. I'm never going to win. He's got five community subs
[10563.26s -> 10571.00s]  from West Yule. Thank you West Yule. Appreciate the five subs. Now one of these little guys.
[10572.60s -> 10576.84s]  Welcome. Thanks for the subs. Welcome all the new subs and welcome all the new mods.
[10579.34s -> 10600.79s]  New mods. Please say hello. Uh, this way. How do I punchy cookie? I don't know. I missed it. Big boy.
[10602.74s -> 10608.82s]  I need a new trailer. Can I copy the big guy? Right. I should be able to copy this guy, right?
[10609.62s -> 10626.20s]  Can I copy anything in the game? Whoa. This is cool. It only has one move. This is a bad thing
[10626.20s -> 10640.71s]  to copy. This thing's terrible. Copy that guy. Wait, should I copy? You're even worse. Wait,
[10640.71s -> 10655.98s]  what is this? Oh, he's cool. I like this guy with the, with the two hands. It's actually fun.
[10666.26s -> 10680.94s]  No, it's all right. No, I like this game so much. Whoa. How can you like this so much? What's going
[10680.94s -> 10689.08s]  on here? Um, I just love projectiles. I love projectiles with travel time. It's my favorite
[10689.08s -> 10706.62s]  thing in any game, especially a third person of first person game. Reminds me. The hell am I
[10706.62s -> 10718.14s]  going to play tribes? What are we going to play tribes? Is the server still on? The game was so
[10718.14s -> 10735.24s]  much fun. We had five more community subs from Saarbruss. Thank you Saarbruss for dropping those
[10735.24s -> 10748.84s]  subs. Appreciate it. I just hit every auto attack. That's so good. First and third are the only two
[10748.84s -> 10773.88s]  options, right? Um, yeah. Well, 2D, right? Like side scroller. What am I thinking of? Bird's eye.
[10773.88s -> 10782.33s]  Yeah. Bird's eye side scrolling, but the projectiles have to travel and have to be able to travel with
[10782.33s -> 10789.80s]  in real physics. I wish I could copy that guy. How do I get that guy? The double R. We'll get
[10789.80s -> 10794.04s]  those two bowling balls. Oh my goodness. Please give me this guy at the end of this.
[10795.26s -> 10801.82s]  That's, that's just the shield. Uh, bubble butt guy, except way cooler. He just has two.
[10802.38s -> 10818.17s]  I want this guy. Please give it to me. I want to play tribes again. The best part about tribes
[10818.17s -> 10824.25s]  was when you hit that blue plate special and you were just 7 million years away and you would just
[10824.25s -> 10844.94s]  go up in the air and you'd go like, it's like, Holy, I killed that guy. This whole thing with
[10847.42s -> 10863.67s]  girl commander blue plate special was the best. And the soldier had that arcing grenade launcher.
[10864.31s -> 10870.17s]  That game was so much fun. Do they make games like that anymore? Is there a game that
[10871.13s -> 10875.75s]  think of what I feel about tribes ascend? I want a game that is that.
[10877.26s -> 10889.10s]  No, no. Well, and we didn't get anything from that last experience.
[10889.82s -> 10895.67s]  I'm going to change this up a bit. I like, I remember I was using a negative,
[10896.47s -> 10909.80s]  put negative back in here. Tribes of school, but never got updated. I think,
[10909.80s -> 10912.84s]  but wasn't the problem with tribes that it got updated, but they put a bunch of
[10912.84s -> 10934.55s]  weird dumb shit in the game that nobody wanted on robots, putting hitscan and tribes.
[10936.12s -> 10941.77s]  Well, where's the, where's the true hitscan in tribes? What are the machine guns?
[10942.49s -> 10946.62s]  But weren't the machine guns even projectiles? You had to still land them.
[10954.50s -> 10972.52s]  Sniper was hitscan really dumb. I think it was, you know, I bet you there was this an
[10972.52s -> 10975.40s]  appetite for something like that. Like a real revival of that kind of game.
[10982.09s -> 10992.76s]  This all projectile based satisfying shots. No, there isn't. Yeah. But this, I'm telling you,
[10992.76s -> 10999.27s]  this shit comes in cycles, man. Everyone, every single person was making a MOBA. Everyone.
[11000.78s -> 11006.22s]  Like if you, if you were a game company and you did not have a like top-down MOBA in development,
[11007.10s -> 11011.99s]  what the fuck were you doing with your life? That's now become BR.
[11012.63s -> 11027.61s]  Did that thing explode? Oh, I'm going to copy this guy. BR is currently like the trend right now.
[11027.61s -> 11031.21s]  It's really popular, but it's, it's going to, it's not going to be there forever.
[11032.17s -> 11036.23s]  When's like the tribes ascend game going to be the, you know, that's what I'm looking for.
[11043.58s -> 11050.10s]  There we go. No, I don't want this guy. This guy sucks. It's going to be in 50 years.
[11050.74s -> 11074.23s]  I don't think so. Oh fuck. I want to turn into this guy. Shit. Ooh, I got it. Okay. What is,
[11074.23s -> 11081.91s]  what is this thing? He has like pulsating shots. Oh, I'd love to see what the fuck was going on.
[11085.45s -> 11091.37s]  Wait, was he about to do the bigger they are, the harder they fall in the same tone.
[11092.74s -> 11113.53s]  Why didn't we get to hear that? We all, we were almost there. The bigger they are,
[11113.53s -> 11120.87s]  the harder they fall. I'm just trying to snipe this guy out. It needs to be working.
[11122.15s -> 11154.23s]  Let's use it. Jump. Jump. Oh, that was a cool hero. Too bad. There he is again.
[11154.23s -> 11168.46s]  It's probably going to be that weird bubble guy. Another thunder robot. Are you shitting me?
[11176.71s -> 11196.41s]  Fucking thunder robot. Are you shitting me? Under the warehouse. What does that mean?
[11203.00s -> 11210.36s]  I'm going to know too weird, too much setup time, too much setup time, too expensive.
[11211.72s -> 11225.26s]  There's my boy right there. Nevermind. Sit back down. Melting them down. Wait,
[11227.59s -> 11239.37s]  hold on. I changed my mind. This is ship level. I'm going to turn into a huge ship or a satellite
[11239.37s -> 11247.70s]  or something. Oh, but in the meantime, you know, I'm going back to, uh, I haven't played with these
[11247.70s -> 11274.52s]  guys in a long time. 250 and then 150. Wait, save it. Do an angry video game nerd impression.
[11276.84s -> 11290.58s]  Um, uh, the problem is it's just donkey shit. It's like the smelliest donkey shit you've ever seen
[11291.22s -> 11300.06s]  in your entire life. Now, look at this guy. This guy just sucks. This game sucks. Is that right?
[11300.06s -> 11313.75s]  That's pretty good. That was all right. Hey guys, fun, uh, fun thing about the angry video game
[11313.75s -> 11329.59s]  nerd. Uh, you know, he's like the D and D of YouTubers. You know that, right? He was doing
[11329.59s -> 11337.11s]  that shit fucking like 20 years ago. Like the Witcher three is a great game, but like it's D
[11337.11s -> 11354.58s]  and D is the reason why like the Witcher three even exists. Whoa. Look at that. What? Come on.
[11355.46s -> 11363.54s]  I can't do this. Oh, that's, that's not cool. I got to play as one of these
[11363.54s -> 11379.27s]  eye of kill rocks. Oh, that's great. Might as well. I can't even fly. Well, you know what to do.
[11385.99s -> 11397.56s]  Oh, look at all those blue plate specials. Actually pretty good character to be here.
[11398.52s -> 11432.38s]  Everyone was like, he's up. What do you have to say now? Oh, extra super powerful. What does it
[11432.38s -> 11438.17s]  look like? Um, does it look like it looks like, uh, like a mega man shot? No, what does it look
[11438.17s -> 11457.88s]  like? It looks like something from a game. He did a lot of work. We get just how much health that
[11457.88s -> 11466.39s]  just brought the G F down buster shots from mega man legends. It kind of does. Yeah. And this is a
[11466.39s -> 11473.26s]  Capcom game. You guys didn't know this game is Capcom. It's made by the same people that made
[11474.22s -> 11502.44s]  resident evil seven. It's not Capcom. It is. That's my best score yet. I think. Yes. Finally,
[11502.44s -> 11508.55s]  a fucking plane. Yeah. They also made resident evil six. Now that they outsourced that that was
[11508.55s -> 11516.14s]  made by Capcom. Hey, you guys know, I like aliens, colonial Marines. I like hat. Like the game
[11516.14s -> 11535.45s]  wouldn't even made by gearbox. You've got a death crystal. Looks like some kind of key data. Blue
[11535.45s -> 11545.14s]  striker. Fastest thing in the game. No attack. How missile Vulcan power beam. I had to type
[11545.14s -> 11554.84s]  Eric Borg who fought during the interplanetary mega Borg war. He can move freely in the sky and
[11554.84s -> 11567.05s]  possesses missiles Vulcans and a deadly power beam. Not expensive either. Lead with that.
[11567.05s -> 11586.89s]  I'll keep you here for a while. 390 remain 180. I got six people now. Cool.
[11596.22s -> 11604.42s]  He's no good at the boundaries. No, not really. Mysterious crystal. Ooh, here comes lower.
[11605.30s -> 11609.43s]  I got some strange data. Watch out at the death force.
[11609.99s -> 11632.92s]  Look at that. Here we go. Plane time. Whoa. Cool. I can't. How do I? Wait, you can hold
[11640.15s -> 11662.82s]  missiles. Wow. What's the charge do? Wally. Ooh, dodge. One of those land. Oh, that was fun though.
[11670.68s -> 11678.60s]  They had some good anti-air. That's the reason why it happened. We both have this. This is cool.
[11679.24s -> 11707.59s]  Don't think so. Watch this shit. Who's quad ninjaed this person? Get it. You're too fast.
[11708.23s -> 11735.54s]  All right. Back it up. I hear a dragon. I do. You already killed my buddy. Nice shot.
[11736.10s -> 11766.92s]  You got it. Come on. You got to give credit. Who else is here? Shit. No, that wasn't even
[11768.01s -> 11803.78s]  that. What are the 3000 GF power? Holy shit. Okay. Don't. Okay. We got sniper. This is a boss
[11803.78s -> 11829.96s]  battle. I didn't say it was. I don't think it is. Save that power though. Got me too. Holy fuck.
[11829.96s -> 11838.49s]  He's still playing this. That long. I mean, I know my streams turned into like four or five hours
[11838.49s -> 11851.53s]  long, but I mean, it's not like that. It's not like that long. Somebody said this is Warframe,
[11852.33s -> 11880.60s]  but imagine if it was a cartoon like this and I would like that. It really isn't. Another dragon.
[11887.54s -> 11901.53s]  Risky, but worth it. Copy the dragon, please. I don't have the copy guy right now.
[11902.65s -> 11920.12s]  Is he even on the team? Turn it on. No, he's not.
[11930.47s -> 11941.08s]  I look over and you guys are fucking crazy. Shit. I like the plane, but it's very vulnerable.
[11941.88s -> 11950.14s]  You have to really fly the hell out of there. Why are you a girl?
[11956.74s -> 11961.22s]  Are you looking for this? Got a death crystal. How many death crystals do I need?
[11962.82s -> 11979.45s]  I've got two. I've got two death crystals. Hey, look. I mean, she looks cool.
[11980.41s -> 11986.92s]  D though. Charge gun, beam knife, charge beam, anchor wire. Fire girl was trained on a secret
[11986.92s -> 11994.39s]  agent. Once her anchor wire is set, she can return to a set point at any time. Very useful when she
[11994.39s -> 11999.43s]  needs to make a sharp exit. That's really good. It's like teleporting, but better. That's right.
[12002.94s -> 12023.75s]  320. That's pretty good. All right. Here we go. Death commander. Who should I bring? All right,
[12023.75s -> 12047.62s]  Manny. You get one more shot off the bench. Let's go. Fly away. Are they homing? I can't hit.
[12047.62s -> 12055.75s]  Okay. I just hit myself with my own missile. That's not even possible. No, your ship is so
[12055.75s -> 12079.91s]  much better than mine. Bombing run. Okay. Anchor point. How does this work? How does this work?
[12095.66s -> 12109.06s]  You can go back to any point? I don't understand. Wait a minute. Okay. You have to fly. You fly
[12109.06s -> 12114.74s]  near it. Wait a second. Hold on. Okay. Now I've just first time ever used this character.
[12114.74s -> 12135.45s]  How did I? Oh, I got hit by the, I think I got hit by it. Oh, this one sucks. There's too many
[12135.45s -> 12145.08s]  of them. Oh, I sure would love to be healed by the best character in the game. I have a support
[12145.08s -> 12153.37s]  character that doesn't do anything. Spends all the time walking around in circles and missing me.
[12154.17s -> 12170.81s]  Okay. Heal me now. Get over here. On earth are you? Come here. Heal me. Heal me. You don't have any
[12170.81s -> 12195.22s]  other. Finally. That character doesn't even have any fucking moves. You're going to heal me or
[12195.22s -> 12227.43s]  what? When you say here, that's something that somebody on the bench would say. Kill it. Kill it.
[12227.43s -> 12259.06s]  That's it. Now you're in big trouble. Now you're in trouble. Oh, excuse me. You got to heal for me?
[12259.06s -> 12270.01s]  Oh shit. It's a nuke. Shoot it. Manna run. Manna. Manna. Manna. Manna. Thank God.
[12270.01s -> 12302.92s]  Tactical nuke. Hope I get one right here. Ooh. Yeah. That has to. That's going into the crew.
[12306.02s -> 12311.70s]  You're useless Tamma. I gave you the power of the death arc, but you still lost.
[12312.34s -> 12323.46s]  What are you talking about? Death arc was not strong enough. Where's that? There it is.
[12323.46s -> 12337.64s]  350. That's pretty solid. Bug Borg. Insect bomb. Insect slicer. Insect scope. Mech life form from
[12337.64s -> 12342.68s]  outer space. Its gate shield protects it from enemy attacks while its right arm is sharp as a blade.
[12343.32s -> 12354.44s]  Its insect scope reduces the power of enemy shots. D-Buff. You can keep Wire Girl on here too.
[12355.94s -> 12372.94s]  Uh. Okay. The shame the toys never happened. The designs in the game kick ass.
[12373.66s -> 12380.04s]  I mean, they're pretty, they are pretty good. They're pretty cool.
[12380.68s -> 12400.68s]  I would have loved to play with these things. Funded. What is there to fund?
[12401.48s -> 12409.66s]  Weren't you like 20 when this came out? Well, I mean, I was, yeah, I was like,
[12410.22s -> 12417.34s]  no, I was like fucking 19, 18 or something. 17. That's besides the point. I'm talking about
[12417.34s -> 12421.58s]  if I was like younger and played this when I was like 10. That would have been sick.
[12426.81s -> 12445.35s]  Charge dude. This is a huge one. Okay. I just found. Nice. It's so good. All right. Don't crash.
[12445.35s -> 12464.44s]  All right. Missiles. Damn, this thing is actually really good. Can you imagine flying around like
[12464.44s -> 12472.23s]  this when you were 10? You would, you would shit your pants if you played this when you were like
[12472.23s -> 12513.77s]  12. Look at those thick, thick beams. Retreat. Can't dodge that. Oh, it's all right. A lot of
[12513.77s -> 12528.78s]  good. Okay. Here we go. Bug, the bug guy. Oh shit. That's he's got recharge, huh? Did I do it?
[12534.97s -> 12550.26s]  I'm kind of hard to tell what's going on here. He doesn't suck. I just, I don't understand yet.
[12552.09s -> 12568.71s]  It's like fields that he's shooting out. It's a debuff field, right?
[12571.30s -> 12585.80s]  All right. I still don't understand how this works. I'm trying to get this to activate somehow.
[12586.60s -> 12595.46s]  X doesn't do it. I feel like touch them. Double tap X. Okay. That makes sense.
[12599.77s -> 12617.37s]  Just mash buttons. Okay. That's good. Let's put them across the whole map. Yeah. This is gonna be
[12617.37s -> 12635.22s]  great. Ready? The game broke. It would have been cool. Did she have a melee? Yeah. And it's pretty
[12635.22s -> 12652.47s]  good. It's quick. Back up. I think that's just a really good character. That's the reason why
[12652.47s -> 12660.22s]  my bug guy was just not fair. This guy's a limited edition. Bug guys are common. He's like a D or
[12660.22s -> 12676.46s]  something. This guy's probably like an S. I won the record for oldest person to play this game.
[12677.18s -> 12689.98s]  That's fine. That doesn't embarrass me. Why are that? Oh, this game is cool. It's a really neat
[12689.98s -> 12698.12s]  game. And I'm, I want to showcase this showcase Saturday. We're checking out this old showcaseable
[12698.12s -> 12705.38s]  game. That's really fun. And really, I wish they'd make games like this again. Look at this showcase.
[12706.10s -> 12714.44s]  No, it's not. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. I guess I have any, you guys still don't
[12714.44s -> 12722.36s]  understand how time zones work. Can you imagine if the earth was like 50 times larger than it is?
[12723.86s -> 12743.50s]  And it could be like Thursday for you. And it's like Monday for me. You'd be stuck in a time loop.
[12743.50s -> 12752.57s]  Days would just be longer. But would we have longer days? Would a day be like 75? Like what?
[12752.57s -> 12761.83s]  One day would be like a week. If the earth was a hundred times bigger than it is now,
[12764.41s -> 12780.62s]  what we might have, we might rotate slower. Thank God I got one. He's learning. Gravity would kill
[12780.62s -> 12792.39s]  us. The earth was okay. If the earth was like, okay, if, if, if how long it takes for you to get
[12793.11s -> 12799.51s]  from like, let's say like New York to London, right? Was it like a eight hour flight,
[12799.51s -> 12803.99s]  11 hour flight? Imagine you should, okay. So if you want to go from like a New York to London,
[12804.87s -> 12815.10s]  it was like four days in an airplane. Like the ocean was 50 times larger. What would happen?
[12815.10s -> 12824.62s]  The earth is still the earth. Like we, we have the same amount of countries in the same places,
[12824.62s -> 12831.83s]  but it's, but like, there's just way more ocean. Is the mass still the same? Yeah. Like the mass
[12831.83s -> 12846.44s]  of the countries is the same, but the ocean is like six million times bigger. Do I have to draw
[12846.44s -> 12854.66s]  this? I might have to draw this for you. Do I have to draw this? I don't think people understand
[12854.66s -> 12878.82s]  what I'm saying here. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is important. So this is what I'm
[12878.82s -> 12900.66s]  talking about. If you clean for you so you can see it nice and good, but it's what you paint.
[12900.66s -> 12904.18s]  You have to course it is. Well, who cares? Look, I'm going to make, I'm going to fix it. I'll fix
[12904.18s -> 12909.70s]  it here. Now your eyes won't hurt. Okay. I got to get this music out of my ears. It's going to
[12909.70s -> 12914.98s]  fucking make me scream. Okay. So here's earth. I'm going to draw you earth. Here's the earth as,
[12914.98s -> 12926.41s]  as it is now. Right? So this is earth. And then like here's, uh, this is Africa. This is like
[12926.41s -> 12936.81s]  North America. Uh, this is, uh, this is Europe, right? Italy. And then over here is like on the
[12936.81s -> 12941.85s]  other side, I can't draw it. It's like, you know, China and Russia and stuff. Okay. Under here is
[12941.85s -> 12944.89s]  South America. Remember it's, I'm just, this is, you just know where it is. All right. So this is
[12944.89s -> 12952.38s]  what the earth looks like now. So what happens? And here's the sun, right? So here's the sun.
[12953.26s -> 12960.54s]  Obviously the, now the earth is spinning like this, right? Spin, spin, spin. Here's the sun.
[12962.10s -> 12968.55s]  Sun also goes like in a circle or something. I don't know. It's going to be a sad planet.
[12971.08s -> 12975.24s]  No, we go in a circle. We go in a circle. We, that's where the circle is. So we circle like
[12975.24s -> 12985.08s]  this. What? Give me different colors. I don't want fucking puke orange. What the, stop. What
[12985.08s -> 12995.50s]  the fuck? All right. So we're going like this, but we're also going like this. So what happens
[12995.50s -> 13001.05s]  in this scenario? How do I, something's wrong with my computer. There's something, something has to
[13001.05s -> 13015.35s]  be wrong with my computer. That doesn't make any sense. Um, something has to be something wrong
[13015.35s -> 13030.70s]  with the computer. Is that eraser? I'm going to try to do this as detailed as I can. Okay. I'm sorry.
[13030.70s -> 13042.33s]  I'll fix it. So what happens when you have the earth like this? So here's the earth. That's the
[13042.33s -> 13057.13s]  earth. Here's the sun right here. And now here is, here's North America. Here is South America.
[13061.93s -> 13076.25s]  Here's Africa. Here's Europe. And then on the other side is right. Where's Mexico?
[13076.25s -> 13083.93s]  Down here. You know what I'm saying? So what happens? We're rotating like this and we're
[13083.93s -> 13091.90s]  also going like this. What have, if the earth is like 60 times bigger, wait, would we not have any
[13091.90s -> 13101.24s]  sunlight? Would it just be, okay. Would there only be sunlight like here? Only. Like in one country.
[13105.66s -> 13112.58s]  If the sun was like tiny, would it be like a flashlight on one country at a time? And would
[13112.58s -> 13117.14s]  everybody else be in pitch black until it finally like moved a little bit and like, and finally,
[13117.14s -> 13125.14s]  okay. Now this right here, this part can get some sunlight. That's not how light works.
[13125.78s -> 13132.44s]  But would it just be darker? Would you, would it just, would it be darker outside? Would we
[13132.44s -> 13152.52s]  wouldn't have big sunshine? It would just be darker. It'd be harsh shadows. So what if all
[13152.52s -> 13157.72s]  the countries are like this in the same spot over here? Like typically like this is like where earth
[13157.72s -> 13162.76s]  is now, right? Imagine this is earth and there's the countries. Imagine they all were in there.
[13163.72s -> 13180.22s]  Would we have like a day of sunlight and then like 12 days of darkness? Yes, we would. Big earth
[13180.22s -> 13188.26s]  theory. That's not how days work. But like our perception of darkness would be longer. It would
[13188.26s -> 13195.62s]  be long. It would be darker for longer. Like it would be like, holy shit, it's dark for so fucking
[13195.62s -> 13205.99s]  long. Even though it's, you know, yeah. It's like this when you play Minecraft. I'm of the opinion
[13205.99s -> 13210.63s]  that in Minecraft the nights are longer and it's been coded that way. I've been told it's not true,
[13210.63s -> 13229.45s]  but it is. Includes my what if the earth was big theory. Oh, you know, there's some science
[13229.45s -> 13233.05s]  channel that's made a video about what if the earth was fucking a thousand times bigger.
[13234.09s -> 13237.19s]  Don't act like I'm some kind of psycho.
[13285.35s -> 13289.83s]  Hey, just who cares how bad you spell? Just spam your keyboard and then the computer will fix it
[13289.83s -> 13297.98s]  for you. Just mash keys. You can do this with your shit bed drunk. Hey there, welcome to life.
[13298.46s -> 13303.98s]  We live in a part of the solar system called the Goldilocks zone. It's not too hot that all the
[13303.98s -> 13309.26s]  water evaporates away, but it's also not too cold where it freezes instead. And unless you're an
[13309.26s -> 13315.02s]  astronaut, the big spherical rock will be your home for life. But what if that home suddenly
[13315.02s -> 13320.06s]  changed? What if in a split second, the earth doubled in size? Let's just write the density
[13320.06s -> 13325.18s]  remains constant. So the mass of the earth increased as well. How would that change things?
[13325.18s -> 13330.46s]  Well, first off, gravity would be very different. The earth would have eight times as much mass and
[13330.46s -> 13337.18s]  gravity would be twice as strong. So if you suddenly weigh twice as much, I said 10 times
[13337.18s -> 13343.74s]  much harder for you to walk and you'd get tired much more on the ground. Another version of yourself,
[13343.74s -> 13349.90s]  a piggyback ride all day, every day, which would look very funny. Over the years, human bones,
[13349.90s -> 13354.38s]  especially in the legs, would have to become stronger to support this increased weight.
[13354.38s -> 13359.82s]  Meanwhile, trees would start to collapse and any new trees that grow in their place might not grow
[13359.82s -> 13366.06s]  as tall. See, there's a limit for how tall a tree can grow, usually around 400 feet or so. This limit
[13366.06s -> 13370.94s]  is determined by gravity. Since the taller the tree is, the more energy is required to transport
[13370.94s -> 13375.66s]  water from the roots to the top. If the amount of energy the tree gains from photosynthesis is
[13375.66s -> 13380.70s]  more than the energy it takes to transport the water, it'll keep growing. Otherwise, it'll stop.
[13380.70s -> 13387.18s]  So if the earth suddenly got twice as big, trees like the California redwood may not be as impressive.
[13387.18s -> 13391.02s]  Luckily, even though the gravitational pull of the earth will be stronger, it still won't be
[13391.02s -> 13396.06s]  enough to break the moon apart. See, in order for that to happen, the moon would have to be within
[13396.06s -> 13400.54s]  the earth's Roche limit. This is the minimum distance the moon can approach the earth without
[13400.54s -> 13405.74s]  being torn apart by tidal forces. This happens because the near side of the moon is pulled in
[13405.74s -> 13410.38s]  harder than the far side. When the moon gets close enough to the earth, the gravity holding it together
[13410.38s -> 13416.06s]  is overcome by this cosmic tug. Inside that limit, earth's gravity will tear the moon apart, giving
[13416.06s -> 13422.46s]  us a ring like those around Saturn. And the more earth there is, the more it will heat up. See,
[13422.46s -> 13427.74s]  if there are more unstable elements in the crust and interior, more heat will reach the surface and
[13427.74s -> 13432.14s]  there may be much more volcanic activity. And I don't know about you, but I'd rather not live
[13432.14s -> 13436.62s]  in a world where there's a constant threat of an exploding volcano. Oh, wait, are we already living
[13436.62s -> 13441.82s]  in that? I'm looking at you, Yellowstone. Anyway, if you could live anywhere in the universe,
[13441.82s -> 13447.10s]  no limitations. Where would it be and why? If I could, I'd totally live in Jupiter's great red
[13447.10s -> 13459.54s]  spot. It'd be pretty dangerous. All right. That doesn't answer my question. What happens to the
[13459.54s -> 13484.68s]  sun? What happens to our sun? We live in strange times. For 200 years now, starting with Thomas
[13484.68s -> 13489.96s]  Robert Malthus, demographers have been sounding the alarm that there isn't enough space and
[13489.96s -> 13496.12s]  resources on earth and that there's an oversupply of people. Don't we the ocean? The earth belonged
[13496.12s -> 13503.40s]  to the class of planets called super earths and had a mass and size two or even 10 times larger.
[13503.48s -> 13510.52s]  Would it solve all of our problems? Or on the contrary, would terrible consequences await us?
[13512.52s -> 13517.24s]  According to the assumptions of Mickey Rosenthal from the University of California,
[13517.24s -> 13523.80s]  Santa Cruz, our planet had every chance of becoming a super earth, but this was prevented
[13523.80s -> 13530.04s]  by Jupiter, which blocked the earth's access to additional building material that could have made
[13530.04s -> 13535.64s]  it much larger. If it weren't for Jupiter, the earth would have grown and almost everything on
[13535.64s -> 13542.36s]  our planet would have shrunk several times over. And this is not a matter of proportions at all,
[13542.36s -> 13549.32s]  but one of enhanced gravity to over increase to a hundred and on a super earth with double
[13549.32s -> 13558.60s]  earth's mass, your weight would increase to 150 kilograms or 330 pounds and up to 750 kilograms
[13558.60s -> 13566.92s]  or 1650 pounds is almost 10 times greater than the was close to that of Kepler 20 B
[13567.56s -> 13574.28s]  with part of the core. This means that the magnetic field protecting us from solar wind could
[13574.28s -> 13582.04s]  disappear and the sun, anyone who survived the frequent meteor showers would wait here in such
[13582.04s -> 13588.12s]  water due to the high pressure. The ocean floor would be covered with a thick layer of ice,
[13588.20s -> 13593.88s]  which would make the carbon cycle and yeah, we would die between the atmosphere and the bowels
[13593.88s -> 13600.52s]  of the planet impossible. In fact, according to Hilkey Schlichting from the University of
[13600.52s -> 13607.56s]  California, Los Angeles, if our planet was a super earth, all the water would simply evaporate.
[13607.56s -> 13613.88s]  According to her assumption, the earth would rotate much closer to the sun in orbit,
[13613.88s -> 13621.88s]  making a complete revolution in only 100 days. Orbit is considered habitable if the star is
[13621.88s -> 13628.44s]  smaller than our son, but at such a distance from our son, all the water on a super earth
[13628.44s -> 13635.40s]  would simply evaporate. Rodrigo Luger from the center from computational astrophysics
[13635.40s -> 13642.28s]  at the Flatiron Institute suggests that all super earths evaporate, except that instead of steam,
[13642.28s -> 13648.60s]  they turn into liquid water. He believes that super earths are formed from separate pieces of
[13648.60s -> 13656.28s]  ice. Then they migrate closer to their star. That's water. And an ocean appears completely
[13656.28s -> 13662.52s]  covering the surface of the planet. Perhaps such planets are the most common in the universe. Among
[13662.52s -> 13670.20s]  the more than 4,000 exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope, about 30% fall in the
[13670.20s -> 13676.92s]  super earth class. If we want to migrate in search of a better place to live, we need to focus
[13676.92s -> 13684.60s]  exclusively on super earths. After all, the remaining 70% truth, it's not a super earth.
[13684.60s -> 13692.12s]  Its theoretical mass and size are not much larger than our earths. However, all known is much closer.
[13692.12s -> 13699.00s]  Okay. Diana Kasikowski, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany,
[13699.00s -> 13706.36s]  believes there may be liquid water on planet GJ 357D. So she plans to search for other signs
[13706.36s -> 13712.84s]  of life on it in the near future. A little further, at a distance of 39 light years from-
[13712.84s -> 13714.12s]  Oh, you're making it sound so weird.
[13714.12s -> 13716.44s]  ...is another super earth, GJ 180D.
[13716.44s -> 13719.56s]  I told you it was earths. I fucking told you this was fucking happening.
[13719.56s -> 13726.81s]  Everybody, do you- Listen to me. Four and a- Three or four hours ago, I was talking about
[13726.81s -> 13731.53s]  how many fucking earths existed. There's a shitload of earths. We're one of like a million
[13731.53s -> 13736.74s]  earths. Everybody calls me crazy. This guy has like a list of four of them already.
[13736.74s -> 13744.34s]  It's 7.5 times larger than the earth, but its main feature is unique. Most exoplanets are
[13744.34s -> 13750.90s]  tidally locked, meaning the same side always faces its star like the moon towards the earth.
[13750.90s -> 13754.98s]  This makes it impossible to form the magnetic field necessary-
[13755.94s -> 13762.50s]  ...a brown and a red dwarf. Still, scientists have found candidates for life among other
[13762.50s -> 13769.94s]  types of planets. For example, K2-18b. It's considered a super earth, but its composition
[13769.94s -> 13772.66s]  is more like a mini-Neptune. This is an intermediate class of planets-
[13772.66s -> 13777.94s]  And weirdly enough, none of the inhabitants have noses. Trying to figure out
[13777.94s -> 13779.54s]  science just couldn't figure out why.
[13807.94s -> 13821.67s]  What do they name the planets like this? Why wouldn't they call it like, I don't know, like
[13822.55s -> 13835.16s]  earth five? Earth like ten? Earth like twenty? Why is it like KGI-42BE1? Just say earth like
[13835.16s -> 13849.91s]  one and just keep numbering them. It's literally trillions. So count to trillion.
[13850.55s -> 13858.62s]  It's not like we don't have the numbers to count them. It could be earth like EL-1000 whatever.
[13858.62s -> 13872.54s]  You could you could hyphen it. You could change it. DC Comics Universe trademarked that idea.
[13873.42s -> 13877.91s]  Watch TikTok compilations. Why the hell would I do that?
[13879.11s -> 13901.78s]  All right, let's go back to this. We watch more science. Name the eight planets without looking.
[13901.78s -> 13917.53s]  Sure. Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth, and Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and Jupiter.
[13920.33s -> 13933.21s]  Did I miss one? I said Mars. Uranus. How could I forget the fucking comedy planet?
[13934.97s -> 13938.57s]  A gotcha war with supersonic powers. Enemies who are hit by his warp speed sonic
[13938.97s -> 13943.37s]  nitorio move don't even realize they've been hit until it's too late. They're dead.
[13944.17s -> 13968.04s]  I'll give it a try. Where's he? Sonic Samurai. Sonic. All right, we're gonna have to take away
[13968.04s -> 13978.79s]  Ant-Man. No, I want to test him out. All right. Command girl has to go away for now. 320.
[13978.79s -> 14009.62s]  350. Where's the double ninja? There we go. Water. Resident sleeper. Liquid water.
[14010.26s -> 14030.70s]  This is my enemy. Oh, sweet. I can handle both of you. Orochi. Let's go.
[14042.14s -> 14067.77s]  Gotcha. Slaves of the humans. I don't really follow that. Fly away. Turn and fire. I got grabbed.
[14067.77s -> 14077.11s]  I got grabbed. I got grabbed. I got grabbed. I got grabbed. He grabbed me. He got me. All right,
[14077.11s -> 14110.71s]  come on, Ant-Man. Do you have bugs? This guy sucks. Unfortunately, he's not very good. Yeah,
[14110.71s -> 14118.20s]  I'm sorry. This is a bench scenario here. This is a bench. This is a bench. Your bench. Check out
[14118.20s -> 14150.76s]  this new guy. Cool. Pretty, pretty strong. My God. Come here. The dash is good, but not against
[14150.76s -> 14161.67s]  these guys. Where'd you get that? He's weird. That's all I have to say about that. Hey, where'd
[14161.67s -> 14176.92s]  you go? He's weird. It looks like Seath. No, he's weird. Hey, welcome to the stream, guys.
[14178.28s -> 14203.11s]  Look at this guy. He's weird. See you in four minutes when I talk again. Come on. He's got such
[14203.11s -> 14212.90s]  good characters. Is there another dragon? Show us your fingernails. No, I feel like you did some
[14212.90s -> 14218.94s]  weird things you want. It's a weird request that I'm not going to give to you. I don't know. I
[14218.94s -> 14236.73s]  don't know what you're doing. I'm going to lose. Just getting stomped again because he has all the
[14236.73s -> 14262.71s]  best characters in the game. Look at this guy. Where'd you get this thing? Stop making excuses,
[14262.71s -> 14271.94s]  man. I have a little baby ninja. He has Seath the dragon and all the Power Rangers. It's not fair.
[14272.82s -> 14297.42s]  Got to train. You're okay. No, you can get grabbed. Get rid of this dumb bug. I don't know. I don't
[14297.42s -> 14306.60s]  like you. You hair. No, not for this one. I'm going with gunman. Gunman, gunman, gunman, gunman.
[14306.60s -> 14314.50s]  And then, of course, bringing you back. Solid so far. All right, and then one more. Level two.
[14318.04s -> 14326.76s]  I like it better. Just redo the whole loadout. No, I just did. And we're going to do this first.
[14335.34s -> 14363.67s]  The bench warmer crew in. We'll have enough of them eventually. This game blue. Where's Drew crew?
[14377.30s -> 14381.94s]  I don't know about that. I don't know about that happening anytime in the next
[14382.74s -> 14388.02s]  six months. Oh, if you weren't here earlier, we could talk about it.
[14388.02s -> 14398.39s]  Block may not have been here earlier. Working on your calendar. May 15th and 16th. I'll be in the
[14398.39s -> 14409.83s]  studio. Green screen DLC for free. Volume two and the Easy Bake Oven stream. We'll be back to back
[14411.98s -> 14417.90s]  that weekend. May 15th and May 16th. Pretty much walked in.
[14438.87s -> 14447.27s]  What about toon town? Yeah, we'll probably do that. We'll probably do all the we're going to do
[14448.47s -> 14456.50s]  the MMO grab bag too. Pretty soon here as well. Probably within the next week or so.
[14457.30s -> 14463.77s]  I just want to get it set up. There's a lot about toon town. I'm in the process of explaining to
[14463.77s -> 14466.17s]  you what happened to toon town and what's going to happen to toon town and where we're going to
[14466.17s -> 14488.04s]  do to town and when toon town is going to happen. What about toon town? Oh, we also have to go back
[14488.04s -> 14503.72s]  to VR too. That's another thing. I'm trying to feel better in a process. I have a ton of VR
[14503.72s -> 14510.07s]  games that I have to play that have come out. We'll do that for like a week. We'll do a VR week.
[14511.03s -> 14517.27s]  We'll probably do that at the end of May. That sounds like a good idea to me.
[14517.91s -> 14540.09s]  But when is No More Heroes 2? All right. Okay. I'll give you a date. I'll give you a date.
[14543.50s -> 14566.34s]  No More Heroes 2. Hopefully never. What? Okay. We're going to do No More Heroes 2 on Monday,
[14567.70s -> 14597.00s]  May 4th. Oh, Wing Soldier. That's my birthday. Uh-huh. Happy birthday. Get a crossbow,
[14597.80s -> 14603.16s]  arrow shot, wing sword, and fly. Wing Soldier is a former border guard and his sharp eyes never
[14603.16s -> 14608.18s]  miss a target. Use the X button to soar over your enemies and unleash your attack. Give him a try.
[14608.18s -> 14623.91s]  200. Not bad. Who do we replace? 230. I can put... Who's somebody's 200? Isn't there somebody's for
[14623.91s -> 14643.93s]  200? 330. What? 220. Here comes the end of the stream voice. Uh-oh. You're not wrong.
[14643.93s -> 14655.22s]  Let's see tomorrow, though. You're not wrong.
[14666.54s -> 14677.14s]  That's actually pretty good. Is that good enough, though, to justify having nothing else?
[14677.94s -> 14691.10s]  That's all this guy has. I mean, it has a good recharge rate. Does he even have... Oh, no,
[14691.10s -> 14717.77s]  he does have an attack. Okay. He's having a little bit of trouble with the regular default
[14717.77s -> 14738.01s]  guy. Okay. He's not terrible. He's not terrible. He's going to end the stream with what? All right,
[14738.01s -> 14759.45s]  I have to pay attention. Wait. Why is my calendar up? Please play Patapon. What's Patapon on? How do
[14759.45s -> 14766.60s]  I play it? What am I going to play it on? It's on the PSP. What the fuck? How am I supposed to do
[14766.60s -> 14796.55s]  that on PS4? Okay. Okay. I'm going to be playing Patapon day after tomorrow. That's done. Got it.
[14796.55s -> 14815.66s]  Locked it in. That's a lie. It's not. What's happening tomorrow? I love this game. I want
[14815.66s -> 14845.29s]  to play it tomorrow. I love it. I love this game. It's so fun. It's fun just to play. Come on. I
[14845.29s -> 14854.12s]  never play just a game and play. I'm always pooping my pants and shit my pants. I'm playing this.
[14854.68s -> 14879.34s]  I got just turned into. Damn. Give it to me. Play tomorrow. Yeah. I'm going to play this tomorrow.
[14879.34s -> 14887.27s]  Then we're going to do Patapon day after that. Don't worry. I'm going to get my fill out of this
[14887.27s -> 14903.66s]  game over the next 24 hours. Trust me. Have I ever played Wattam? No, I have not. I heard it's very
[14903.66s -> 14922.89s]  fun though. All right. This is it. I'm at the end. I need that helmet back. Who's my ally? Because
[14922.89s -> 14940.92s]  they're kicking the shit out of this guy. Don't die. This is all he has. I have to get around him.
[14940.92s -> 14944.20s]  I'm just doing support inquire. He'll just go in and dive in and kill him.
[14945.14s -> 14954.44s]  It is another person. We're going to play Devil May Cry 2. I don't know.
[14959.70s -> 14964.98s]  Spawning in and getting hit right in the mouth and dying. That's too bad.
[14974.06s -> 14987.37s]  Yes. Literally any one of them, but this is the third claw robot. I don't want three of these.
[14987.93s -> 14999.61s]  Give me another one. Oh my God. 100. Why are you fighting both us and the death force? Revenge.
[14999.61s -> 15006.31s]  The gachaborgs are the enemies of my father. Vito, I will give you a free lesson. The death
[15006.31s -> 15011.98s]  crystal is an important item that can bring you to the sky fortress. Next time, let's battle to
[15011.98s -> 15035.70s]  see which of us will be the ultimate winner. So his father. Ultimate winner. Finish it? I have
[15035.70s -> 15041.69s]  to finish this. What are you talking about? This is the, I'm almost at the end of the game.
[15042.41s -> 15054.34s]  What do you, how do you, how the hell would you know that? Up until like 12 hours ago,
[15054.34s -> 15071.51s]  you guys didn't even know this game existed. I want ship. I like ship. I want more ship.
[15072.15s -> 15089.13s]  I want like three of them in a row. Google. Is it, is it time to beat things on gachaborgs?
[15089.13s -> 15103.35s]  I don't know. I'm not sure they would be. I mean, it's like, it's, there's only 12 to 30 hours.
[15110.95s -> 15117.94s]  Main story, 10 and a half main and extras 22 and a half. I'm not just doing only story missions,
[15118.50s -> 15142.18s]  but you are. I'm not. As you have to remember, we've paused like three times to talk about
[15142.18s -> 15156.09s]  fucking like dog food. This has been at least a full probably 45 minutes of this stream.
[15156.65s -> 15159.45s]  And the last one had been about, I've been dog food conversations in quotes.
[15160.17s -> 15173.51s]  All right. I want to send these to the warehouse. Fuck these things.
[15174.15s -> 15181.16s]  It's taking up space. These battle girls send them to the warehouse.
[15190.87s -> 15196.50s]  What are you 350? Why can't you be 330? That's annoying. Which one are you? There you go.
[15196.50s -> 15206.39s]  I'll use. Yeah, you're pretty good. Well, here's the thing. When I play tomorrow,
[15206.39s -> 15208.87s]  if I finish the game, when I finish the game, I'll probably finish the game tomorrow.
[15210.54s -> 15213.90s]  If it's still, I'm not just going to stop streaming if it's only been a few hours.
[15216.74s -> 15220.58s]  Like I said, we go, we're going to be going like four to six hours a stream.
[15221.22s -> 15238.66s]  Defeat the special unit. Here comes the third day of this.
[15247.75s -> 15273.62s]  Okay. That hurt. That hurt. Oh, why? What the fuck? Oh my God. Why? Somebody broke something
[15273.62s -> 15297.02s]  fucking crazy. I had, I read it and it fucking made me get hurt. I fucking can't even. Why did
[15297.02s -> 15344.78s]  you say that? Can a nuke hit a plane? Oh, sick. Drop it. No, I'm going to get hit by the nuke.
[15344.78s -> 15364.66s]  Ooh, just outside. Wait, here it comes again. Quick run. Run. He's going to kill this as well,
[15364.66s -> 15378.65s]  isn't he? I'm going to hide in the shoe box. I'm safe. We should have worked. Don't fire that
[15378.65s -> 15412.71s]  thing point blank, man. Nope. One, two, three. One, two, three. I can't even do it. I have to
[15412.71s -> 15427.80s]  have like four glasses of wine. It was a fresh meme, fat earther. I think you just did. I think
[15427.80s -> 15463.59s]  you just did. Little hill. Ooh, the dragon's den. Let's do it. Same team. 7900 GF. All right.
[15463.59s -> 15494.20s]  Give them everything you got. Turn. Go. Blast turn. Go. Flat turn. Go. Flat turn. Fire. Hey.
[15494.76s -> 15501.78s]  Fucking goddamn fucking game. Play this tomorrow. Yeah, see if I play this tomorrow.
[15501.78s -> 15522.44s]  Fucking game is so stupid. What power do you have? I'm not even close. Holy shit. I'm doing it.
[15528.49s -> 15534.17s]  What the fuck? One of them is doing ice. Why did you fall out of the sky?
[15536.39s -> 15580.17s]  Okay. Mike, mute. What? I should fix it. Whoa, watch out. Did you copy a dragon? That's actually
[15580.17s -> 15593.75s]  a really good idea. You probably can. I'm still doing okay though. I'm going to save this power.
[15597.29s -> 15632.63s]  Or am I? Oh, super frog. I can't stop saying that, can I? This one's so many dragons. What
[15632.63s -> 15658.71s]  the hell? I won't ever stop. I won't. Excuse me. Do I have an ally still? Or they did. Dead.
[15660.34s -> 15704.06s]  Dead. Well, I did a lot of work. Right through the gut. Which one's more dangerous? Ice or
[15705.53s -> 15720.87s]  that's bad. It's okay. I gotta get out. Oh, come on. I didn't even see. It wasn't even on the screen.
[15721.59s -> 15741.35s]  It wasn't even on the screen. Important. Here we go. Die and... All right. This one was kind of
[15741.35s -> 15756.54s]  annoying. Glad I don't have to do that again. Real wink. It's a bad dodge ratio. Oh well. Dragon.
[15768.60s -> 15782.38s]  Nice. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Give me another one. Give me ice dragon too. Oh, that's what we call
[15783.26s -> 15799.54s]  good. How much are they worth? Let's take a look. Thunder dragon. 1100. 500 health. Thunder bomb
[15799.54s -> 15805.45s]  and thunder breath. Roger Borg, who was born from a huge storm cloud. The thunder dragon is an
[15805.45s -> 15811.53s]  incarnation of electricity and can control lightning using his horn as a lightning rod.
[15812.25s -> 15831.69s]  Cool. Fire dragon's a thousand. Fire breath and fire bomb. Huge shits. Big bits.
[15841.38s -> 15851.75s]  Uh, there were big bits. 5,000 of them from core monster. 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. They were right.
[15852.47s -> 15859.13s]  Thanks for the huge money core monster and core monster says, are you doing okay Jerma?
[15860.42s -> 15868.38s]  Yeah, I'm doing great. I'm doing great. I'm having a blast. I'm having a great time. Things are going
[15868.38s -> 15883.62s]  good. Hope they are going good with you as well. Thanks for the gigantic money. More community
[15883.62s -> 15902.70s]  subs coming in from Mick. Thanks a lot, Mick. Six community subs. Remember blink twice. Three,
[15902.70s -> 15914.76s]  480. Three, 10. I like you. Let's try the dragon. Uh, dragon over here. Let's do it. Defeat the
[15914.76s -> 15935.54s]  ultimate cannon unit. That's the longest I've gone without blinking. I have no idea. All right. It's
[15935.54s -> 15951.43s]  the mega cannon. He's so slow. Holy shit. He's gone. I'm getting hit with everything.
[15953.19s -> 15960.65s]  All right. Settle down. This thing's a fucking firework. What? He's one of those fireworks that
[15960.65s -> 15973.11s]  you sit on the ground and light like those fountain things. Bad matchup. What the fuck?
[15975.86s -> 15982.52s]  Oh, cause he. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's all right. I'll get it right here. Just don't get
[15982.52s -> 15990.89s]  anywhere near him. I mean the blast. That's probably it, right? Is it two of these? If this
[15990.89s -> 15998.79s]  two of these is going to be bad. Oh, there's like five of these actually. This is like probably
[15998.79s -> 16028.10s]  four or five of these. I need fast flyers. I know you want sex appeal with this dream,
[16028.10s -> 16042.95s]  but I don't think the dragon's for you. That's funny. I fast you. We need speed. Fast, fast,
[16043.35s -> 16059.82s]  fast. Who's fast? Battle girls are fast. Valkyries fast. Uh, other Valkyries are fast.
[16060.38s -> 16076.36s]  So it's going to be just about dashing around and flying around. Let's try it.
[16086.55s -> 16099.30s]  You also need people that are fast. So you come on in. Damn it. I had a joke there.
[16100.10s -> 16110.78s]  Restart it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. What happens if I quit? I'll do it next time.
[16111.26s -> 16130.33s]  All right. Let's make sure I have full charge. Get the fuck out. Hey, get what the where are
[16130.33s -> 16157.45s]  all these people coming from? It got me. It got me grabbed. Get away from me. Touch that.
[16157.45s -> 16180.22s]  It's like the samus ball. Oh my God. Oops. Holy shit. That wasn't fast enough. Can't shoot up. Can
[16180.22s -> 16205.70s]  you? This thing's still on me. Oh, this sucks. Ass. Okay. I got to be chunky people, beefy.
[16213.16s -> 16228.98s]  Jesus. This is bad. It's because of the dumb capture device thing. Dodge. I can't move.
[16231.80s -> 16270.14s]  Just dodge. Just dodge that. Dodge it. Just run. Just dodge that. Make a dick flatten. All right.
[16270.70s -> 16283.03s]  It's time. It's time to call somebody up for the minor league. You get in here. You get in here.
[16284.63s -> 16301.58s]  You get in here. What? Oh, I had secret weirdos. No, none of you. Not hatchet, man. He sucks. Just
[16301.58s -> 16323.46s]  give him a shot. Oh, who else can I even use here? Thunder dragon. If this doesn't work,
[16323.46s -> 16328.84s]  I'm going to do thunder dragon. 200 points. Oh, but just get a free ninja.
[16347.14s -> 16368.60s]  Yes. Yes. Here we go. Go. Get over there. He's going to make it. He's going to make it.
[16370.66s -> 16376.12s]  He's going to make it. He's going to make it. Oh, yes.
[16388.41s -> 16415.62s]  All right. Time to bring in the big guns. Can't shoot something that's behind you.
[16415.62s -> 16443.51s]  I'm going to try thunder dragon. Under dragon and it's time for thunder dragon.
[16443.51s -> 16473.27s]  Under dragon and then hatchet man. Strategy is just fly immediately. Where's the dragon?
[16473.27s -> 16499.53s]  Wait. Okay. We're going to get over there with the ninja. Just kill hatchet man. Is anybody fast here?
[16500.54s -> 16503.26s]  I didn't even mean to press that button, but we're going to use mana.
[16503.90s -> 16537.08s]  Copy. I don't think I can copy them. Made it. All right. Here we go. I'm supposed to fly.
[16537.64s -> 16546.18s]  You know, you've been trying. I said it worked. It worked. It worked. It worked.
[16546.18s -> 16555.61s]  It's going to stay in the corners. Oh, fuck. Fly the other way. Fly the other way. Get up.
[16557.27s -> 16568.71s]  Jump. Jump. You fucking worthless. Jump in the air. I couldn't do anything. I was stun locked.
[16568.71s -> 16592.46s]  Can I just have like five of these guys? Fuck this mission. God damn it.
[16593.34s -> 16615.43s]  Do X with the dragon. All right. I'm going to do it right now. Heal the support units.
[16615.99s -> 16621.91s]  Well, I mean, I just, I die instantly. If I get, if I'm on any part of the map that he's facing,
[16621.91s -> 16632.92s]  I'm just dead. It's an instant dead. You got to be all the way at his side. Are you going to get
[16632.92s -> 16640.01s]  right? And this doesn't matter. It's over. I've tried and I'm dead. All right. Get over there
[16640.01s -> 16676.68s]  and just zap them. Just keep it up. Just puke on them. Oh, that's great. And now I'm fucking
[16676.68s -> 16691.37s]  grabbed. That does a lot of damage. All right. Where's the other one? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[16692.17s -> 16703.22s]  What the fuck? Oh my fucking Jesus. Get up and grab your head, man. It's not that I'd get up there.
[16704.90s -> 16720.54s]  My head. Okay. X immediately. I'm pressing X the second the game starts. Oh, I got to be the
[16720.54s -> 16773.53s]  editing. Here we go. X immediately. Give me a fucking break. Does cover work? Find out right
[16773.53s -> 16813.61s]  now. Nope. He shot me through the wood. It's up to you. Okay. Okay. I'm going to get, what am I
[16813.61s -> 16842.06s]  going to do? I don't think I can copy. I will try it though. Use the jet. Jet actually was pretty
[16842.06s -> 16859.45s]  good. I wish I had more planes. I guess I could probably unlock them here. Okay. Get over there
[16859.45s -> 16876.41s]  and copy. It actually works. It worked. No, how do I? It actually worked. That's unbelievable.
[16876.89s -> 16888.55s]  I can do that. Where's the other one? That might be all I needed. Get the fuck out of the way.
[16888.55s -> 16893.37s]  Forget about the head. Just get out of the way. He's going to fucking fire at you. How the fuck
[16893.37s -> 16898.65s]  are you supposed to get the fuck? Come on. Battery man. Whatever you are. Get over there.
[16908.41s -> 16936.15s]  Dude, the thing just turns on a dime when it wants to fire. Getting close. It fires. I can copy. I
[16936.15s -> 16946.39s]  can copy. Copy, copy, copy and charge. Shoot it. Is it B or X for the charge? I don't know.
[16960.86s -> 16981.16s]  Did it fire? What is going on? Why can't I know? I was holding X and then I got hit and
[16981.16s -> 17022.34s]  all my health disappeared. That's called losing. I have to hold this. Wait, I have to hold
[17025.03s -> 17035.90s]  fire at that. It worked. Oh my God. It worked. Okay. Is there any more of them?
[17047.50s -> 17056.50s]  It's okay. I killed two of them. It comes three. Get over there. You fucking grabbed me. You piece
[17056.50s -> 17065.56s]  of shit. I can't believe it. Dumbest thing ever. Un-fucking-believable. Why? What the fuck?
[17067.67s -> 17092.09s]  Battery man. Attack him. There's another one over there. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away.
[17092.81s -> 17123.48s]  Where'd he go? Just stun lock him. Don't let him do anything. He's up too high.
[17125.06s -> 17145.06s]  Oh, the screen. All right. That. Oh, okay. Just needs, it's foolproof. I just need support.
[17146.55s -> 17155.96s]  Heal the fuck out of me. Oh, the hatchet guy's still in here. Right. Shit. He's got to go. He's
[17155.96s -> 17182.60s]  got to go. Suck. Oh, it's okay. It's not okay. Fuck you. No. Get out of here. Fucking battery.
[17185.38s -> 17227.03s]  Wait, what? Is everything fine, right? Where'd they go? Are they here? They're in storage?
[17227.03s -> 17242.58s]  No, they're not. Are they still here? Do I just not see them? What's wrong with me? Have I gone
[17242.58s -> 17255.56s]  crazy? They're there. First column. They're right there on screen. Where? I see you. You're here.
[17256.62s -> 17270.68s]  Where's, okay. I thought I had to reset the whole thing. I got to find a character that can do this.
[17270.68s -> 17309.66s]  Nobody got deleted, right? Wait, what? Wait, what? Hold on. Speaking of wait, what? Wait, what?
[17309.66s -> 17326.20s]  Wait, what? What? Here we go. We can edit that together to make it sound better. I'm going to
[17326.20s -> 17343.70s]  stand still. The shield blocks attacks. Will it block this attack? That's the question. We found
[17344.34s -> 17357.75s]  our ultimate counter. Get the fuck away from me. I have to be in front of him. No, attack.
[17378.98s -> 17397.94s]  No cheese for you. Come on, man. What the fuck? Hold on a minute. Does battery man have a shield?
[17397.94s -> 17419.64s]  No, he sucks. You have a shield and you're better. I'll get you close. And then who does
[17419.64s -> 17423.00s]  like an absolute shitload of damage? We need something. We need somebody that does damage.
[17425.59s -> 17438.97s]  360. Wait, the pink magnet. Oh shit. That's not a bad idea.
[17458.31s -> 17471.11s]  I just, no, I picked the wrong support. Like it matters. I'm only picking this because this
[17471.11s -> 17498.20s]  guy has a shield. Okay. Get close enough. Block. But your shield not good enough to block. Wait,
[17498.20s -> 17534.14s]  what? I blocked that shit. Oh, it might be it only blocks energy attacks. Nice. Where's the other one?
[17541.83s -> 17576.86s]  Firing anymore. This thing's not firing. I can't even aim this. Can't grab you. That's so much
[17576.86s -> 17583.77s]  damage. If I could just keep this guy alive, you see how unbelievable that is. They spawn across
[17583.77s -> 17602.84s]  the whole damn map. That's horse shit. That's the definition of absolute dog shit. He just,
[17602.84s -> 17618.52s]  he turns so quickly and then just blows up the whole map. All right. If I throw the head,
[17618.52s -> 17623.29s]  I'll take 50% damage off of them. And then he shoots me and I explode and die because he
[17623.29s -> 17631.24s]  fills the whole map with a radar beam. Just build a fucking army with low cost units. I'll try that.
[17631.88s -> 17681.16s]  Peasant army. Oh wait, they're in the warehouse. Okay. I got 910 flying units too. Flying units
[17681.16s -> 17687.64s]  are pretty cheap, aren't they? 200, 230, 240. What's the cheapest thing? Can I sort by cheap?
[17688.44s -> 17728.58s]  Revolver gunman. Uh, I got 440, 240. All right, let's go. No, these guys are annoying. They help.
[17728.58s -> 17795.94s]  They can't kill us all. Stay behind them. Stay behind them. They can't fucking kill us all.
[17795.94s -> 17871.94s]  All right. Oh shit. I didn't mean to do that. They can't kill us all. Together we are massive.
[17871.94s -> 17907.74s]  Together we are one. Individually we are weak. Together we are strong. Attack. Their defenses
[17907.74s -> 17977.26s]  are down. Attack. Where one dies, one will return. Final battle. This is it. Magnet guy really helped
[17977.26s -> 18003.19s]  too. It's over. Hopefully a crystal that can be combined into a cool monster robot. Nice. Okay.
[18003.19s -> 18018.82s]  Another one. I'm gonna run out of room for these. What am I gonna do with all these Funko Pops?
[18029.90s -> 18047.88s]  All right. All right. That's it. See you tomorrow. That's it. Same time, same place. See you tomorrow.
[18047.88s -> 18055.75s]  Tomorrow we are going to, I wonder how long, how much longer it'll take us to beat the gacha
[18055.75s -> 18065.94s]  force. We beat this game in an hour or two. That's fine. We'll do something else. And then
[18065.94s -> 18081.64s]  of course I'm going to do Patapon the day after that. That's game fun. Hope you had fun. I did.
[18084.41s -> 18095.37s]  We will do Patapon on, what's today? Tuesday? Yeah. On Thursday. Play Jump King. I can't do
[18095.37s -> 18103.58s]  that anymore. I deleted my save. Somebody got a screenshot hopefully eventually. Thanks for
[18103.58s -> 18108.78s]  watching. We'll see you tomorrow. Have a great rest of your night. I'll be here tomorrow.
[18108.78s -> 18119.77s]  Good night. Goodbye. Take care. See you later. Go into the bits and the subs. Start that music.
[18119.77s -> 18135.29s]  Why don't we? So earlier this evening, Peaceful Haley gave $2.50. Excited for the green screen
[18135.29s -> 18141.83s]  stream finally, but I do hope you're doing well. I'm doing all right. I'm doing good. Like I said
[18141.83s -> 18147.91s]  before, doing this whole thing where I don't sit down for that long, more than six hours,
[18149.40s -> 18157.69s]  allows me to stay loose. I can move around. It's still a problem, but it's probably going to be
[18157.69s -> 18165.24s]  for a long time until it is actually solved. So it's not like, hey, I've got to get this figured
[18165.24s -> 18170.10s]  out. It's going to be gone in a day. I'll see you in a day. I think I just have to come to terms
[18170.10s -> 18173.46s]  with the fact that this is going to be a long-term thing that I have to figure out and deal with and
[18174.18s -> 18181.56s]  treat it and see what happens. But it's, I'm feeling better when I'm able to move around.
[18182.12s -> 18192.82s]  I am doing well though. Thank you Maxtronaut for the 400 bits. Jerma, the virus took both my job,
[18192.82s -> 18197.91s]  so I can't sub. Don't worry about that. But here's all my bits. You're my favorite streamer and I'm
[18197.91s -> 18207.90s]  so excited for another round of laughs. Don't worry about subbing to this channel. Use that money on
[18207.90s -> 18220.36s]  you. Thank you though. Cream corn. Thanks for 250. Wow. Cream corn 31. I can't believe I haven't
[18220.36s -> 18225.30s]  played stalker call of Pripyat before. This game is so good. Thanks for letting me play it on your
[18225.30s -> 18237.54s]  couch. I'm going to do it on the green screen. I'm going to sit there and pretend to play a game
[18237.54s -> 18244.92s]  like with you. I'll give you a bunch of different clips of me on a, you know, I mean me sitting on
[18244.92s -> 18253.50s]  couch, just reacting to things. We don't have very many seated reactions. They kind of need to be
[18253.50s -> 18260.49s]  there. And I'm just going to pretend to sit. I'm going to sit down on a fake chair so you can put
[18260.49s -> 18269.02s]  me seated wherever you want. Obstinawal, thanks for the three dollars and 22 cents. Jerma, when he
[18269.02s -> 18306.30s]  plays gotcha force. Hold on. Okay. We'll, we'll try this one. Is that even going to work? Wait,
[18306.30s -> 18325.88s]  is it just tiny? Is that the problem? Oh, it's tiny. What is that? I don't know. That's, that's
[18326.52s -> 18333.96s]  me playing gotcha force. What's more, why do I have a big dent in my head? I don't know.
[18333.96s -> 18342.26s]  I didn't make it. Hurly boy, thanks for the five community subs. Don't think I caught that earlier,
[18342.26s -> 18348.26s]  but thank you. Rosophila, thanks for the 250. You're rambling about how God and aliens would
[18348.26s -> 18351.94s]  create like a hundred planets instead of just one is actually a strong argument for us living in a
[18351.94s -> 18357.82s]  simulation. If a species had the power to simulate an entire simulation, then they may as well simulate
[18357.82s -> 18361.98s]  millions. And if that's the case, there's a much higher chance that we're one of the millions of
[18361.98s -> 18382.12s]  simulations than the one real one. Not a strong argument for anything. Thanks to the 250. Saint
[18382.12s -> 18386.84s]  sauce. Thanks to three dollars. Please play Spore someday. I will go back to it one day. I tried it
[18386.84s -> 18394.89s]  on stream and it was flashing and it was bugs and it was really, really bad. Maybe one day.
[18395.45s -> 18400.57s]  Super Bruce, thanks for the 10 community subs and the five dollars here. Reasons I watched
[18400.57s -> 18406.39s]  Jerma 95, 10% gameplay, 90%. He's ranting about aliens brownies or whether the random
[18406.47s -> 18419.69s]  shit never changed. We had at least 55% gameplay tonight. 60% gameplay. Something like that.
[18421.77s -> 18426.42s]  Thanks to the five dollars though. Smelly boy, thanks for the 250. I'm going to report your
[18426.42s -> 18433.27s]  alien God rant to our atheism. So you better watch out buster. Subreddit for everything.
[18433.27s -> 18442.01s]  I freak out. Thanks for the five dollars and banned from giving messages after the last time
[18452.42s -> 18469.90s]  and banned from giving messages on stream and the screen and the screen face cam. Now they said I
[18469.90s -> 18485.99s]  did it. Somebody says I did it in all capitals. Congratulations. Congratulations. I will no longer
[18485.99s -> 18493.59s]  read bits messages from that view. I'm just telling you, I've look, there's only so many times you
[18493.59s -> 18501.75s]  like give porn codes and make, talk, make up, talk about how you drink at work and stuff. I can't do
[18501.75s -> 18525.16s]  it. I can't do it. I just can't do it. Not safe. He hates that guy. I told you last time. I was
[18525.16s -> 18536.33s]  thinking about just not reading anymore. I'm going to hold myself to that. Banned from giving bits
[18536.33s -> 18565.32s]  for life. You banned from giving me money. All right, we're going to move on. Jerma's low key
[18565.32s -> 18577.58s]  and asshole. You're one of the people that used one of the porn codes like a month ago, aren't you?
[18581.50s -> 18596.84s]  Okay, making sure we know. Hey Sticks Renegade, thanks for two dollars and fifty cents.
[18596.84s -> 18601.08s]  Five grand reminds me when I spent really roughly four thousand dollars on my multiple furry
[18601.08s -> 18606.20s]  commissions over the past four years. That's not a lot. I remember a bidding war on a furry commission
[18606.20s -> 18615.26s]  that went upwards of three thousand dollars for one art. What's a furry commission? You pay
[18615.26s -> 18625.18s]  somebody to make a furry art of you? How big is a five thousand dollar picture? Is it a mural?
[18625.66s -> 18655.29s]  Furry mural. Furry mural. Whatever. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. Hopefully it was
[18655.29s -> 18660.89s]  worth it. Hopefully you got quality content there. I hope so. Ajax, the mediocre. Thanks for the
[18660.89s -> 18664.89s]  fifteen dollars. I just watched the public domain VOD earlier. I grew up watching The Three Stooges
[18664.89s -> 18673.03s]  and it was really cool to see it again. Love what you do. That was a fun night. Good to do that
[18673.03s -> 18687.74s]  again. I'm glad you enjoyed it. The Three Stooges and The Ritz Brothers. We have to watch more Ritz
[18687.74s -> 18694.79s]  Brothers movies. They knocked it out of the park with the gorilla. Thanks for the fifteen dollars.
[18695.35s -> 18704.39s]  Glad you liked it. A post thanks to the five hundred bits post. They say, hey Jerma, I had a
[18704.39s -> 18709.18s]  massive panic attack the night before last. It was probably the worst one I've ever had. I was crying
[18709.18s -> 18714.86s]  so hard I puked and was hallucinating. A woman that was painting her nails and telling me to kill
[18714.86s -> 18721.32s]  myself. Holy shit. I've been extremely depressed my whole adult life due to some medical problems
[18721.32s -> 18726.26s]  that forced me to be bedridden from ages 16 to 18. Even then your videos would always make
[18726.26s -> 18738.25s]  me laugh regardless. Damn. I've never I've never hallucinated before but I can imagine
[18738.25s -> 18754.07s]  that hallucinating is fucking horrible. It's just you something is there. Like a person is there.
[18754.07s -> 18762.50s]  But I can't even imagine. I can't imagine. How do I know I haven't? I mean I guess maybe I don't
[18763.70s -> 18774.36s]  think I ever have. They gave another five dollars and they say continued. They say during yesterday's
[18774.36s -> 18780.34s]  stream you read my chat messages like four times and that made me feel so much better. That alone.
[18780.34s -> 18784.42s]  I got some sleep. I actually got some sleep which is pretty rare for me nowadays. I just want to let
[18784.42s -> 18788.10s]  you know that you have been a massive factor in the maintenance of my mental and emotional health.
[18788.10s -> 18799.40s]  The bottom of my heart love you. If I can have that kind of effect on somebody I'm just happy that it
[18799.40s -> 18804.71s]  I'm happy that there's something here for you to care about and like and enjoy. But I also hope
[18804.79s -> 18815.75s]  and I implore you to if you haven't already is to try to get a professional involved. Try to get
[18815.75s -> 18832.92s]  yourself on the path to getting better. It's a never-ending process but if somebody gets something
[18832.92s -> 18837.88s]  out of this stream if you think it's fun you like to be around here that's I'm happy. I really am
[18837.88s -> 18841.88s]  happy that you're around and that you're here to hang out and have fun and laugh and talk shit and
[18841.88s -> 18858.65s]  enjoy the streams. Please please also take care of yourself because even if this gives you some
[18858.65s -> 18864.15s]  this stream can give you happiness or even if some people have said this is one of the only
[18864.15s -> 18871.13s]  things that can. I hope that over the course of the next some odd years of your life you can find
[18871.13s -> 18888.18s]  steps to find other things that do make you happy too. Trying to get healthy and trying to get
[18888.18s -> 18894.62s]  yourself on the right path is everyone's trying to do it but I wish you the best. I really do.
[18895.34s -> 18910.30s]  Thank you post. Have a great night. Thank you. It can be dangerous to put so much stock in one
[18910.30s -> 18915.21s]  thing for your happiness. Yeah and that's kind of what I mean. That's kind of what I mean by that
[18915.21s -> 18926.26s]  is trying to find other stuff that you know makes you happy. It might take a while to find it but
[18927.06s -> 18940.41s]  it's a lot healthier that way but thank you again. Silent serenity thanks for 250.
[18940.97s -> 18946.26s]  It should be noted that the UFO declassified videos aren't new and have been in the circulating
[18946.26s -> 18950.26s]  on the internet for years. More so it's my understanding that the military has a ton of
[18950.26s -> 18956.26s]  these recordings and usually they're determined to be things like birds planes or balloons upon
[18956.26s -> 18962.18s]  inspection. They tend to look really crazy just because of the flight and camera physics involved.
[18962.18s -> 18966.98s]  Videos were originally leaked by a space conspiracy conspiracy theory company
[18966.98s -> 18979.64s]  owned by the guitarist of blink 182. It's a very very strange last sentence that I've it's like
[18979.64s -> 18995.26s]  okay all right I haven't seen these videos I I don't know I whatever there's aliens there
[18995.26s -> 19006.39s]  there is aliens look we're just still here if the aliens if aliens wanted to like focus a
[19006.39s -> 19010.73s]  fucking death star beam at us do what do you think you don't think they've already would have
[19010.73s -> 19019.18s]  done that by now what's stopping them you know what what's like stopping the aliens from like
[19019.18s -> 19034.97s]  just death starring the planet I don't think they want to I don't think they care for now
[19034.97s -> 19041.98s]  it's taking a while to get here wait did you think they they fired it already they fired it like
[19041.98s -> 19056.22s]  four million years ago it's just taking like six billion years to get here it's coming they
[19056.30s -> 19068.82s]  already fired it yeah we still yeah we still got 5.9 billion years left well that's not true
[19068.82s -> 19075.88s]  that you know that that's assuming all the trees are here that's assuming the grass still grows
[19077.70s -> 19099.96s]  not so sure omega lull 2021 omega lull 2021 why is that so funny hey the boom town rats thanks for

[19138.58s -> 19142.10s]  thoughts on putting the music and community content nights between the art and videos

[19351.40s -> 19365.14s]  as hard as i can that started okay i'm trying that was like one emotion that he does no that's one
[19365.14s -> 19380.41s]  part of a tenth of his personality i kind of nailed it for one second that's it that's adam
[19380.41s -> 19390.58s]  sandler what are the other nine emotions i don't know why don't you ask him on zoom at your next
[19390.58s -> 19399.06s]  school assembly sure he'll answer it for you hey moss lion thanks for the 250 i think i recall
[19399.06s -> 19403.32s]  you saying that you and kim played animal crossing off stream during your move and then you later
[19403.32s -> 19407.80s]  implied you weren't into the idea of playing it live anymore that's all well and good but it'd be
[19407.80s -> 19412.52s]  fun for everyone to get a tour of your island at some point as an aside point much love to you in
[19412.52s -> 19421.40s]  the community you're all a blast oh i just have to hook up the switch the switch is not hooked
[19421.40s -> 19429.32s]  up in here but the ship kind of sailed on animal crossing for me because of the move that was just
[19429.32s -> 19440.57s]  what we did kim and i would just pass it back and forth and play it maybe maybe when i get the
[19440.57s -> 19446.79s]  switch in here we can take a look peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 so i was wondering your opinion
[19446.79s -> 19452.39s]  on fixed camera angles like what resident evil used to do do you think they would ever come back
[19452.39s -> 19456.23s]  i hope not people say it's too risky but they also said that about over the shoulder cameras
[19456.23s -> 19459.51s]  in resident evil and it worked well i don't know i think seeing a fixed camera game in this day
[19459.51s -> 19465.19s]  and age would be interesting and refreshing i really hope not i hate them i'm one of those i'm
[19465.19s -> 19469.91s]  one of those people that makes like the five page reddit essay about how much i don't know i don't
[19469.91s -> 19484.36s]  like them hand controls get rid of them don't ever have them come back fixed camera angles they is
[19484.36s -> 19491.62s]  really this is like a couple scenarios maybe where it'd be interesting but it was just uh no
[19491.62s -> 19506.23s]  there isn't even one remake is amazing yeah but i like to see i'm like i know it's part of it
[19506.95s -> 19514.41s]  i know though you can't see what's in front of you i want to see what's in front of me you open up a
[19514.41s -> 19518.41s]  door and the camera angle is fixed and then you have that problem with fixed camera angles and
[19518.41s -> 19522.65s]  they'll never solve this this is the this is the number one reason why i hate it because the
[19522.65s -> 19529.29s]  trigger point for the other camera angles is this one line if you cross that line it changes the
[19529.37s -> 19535.16s]  camera if you cross back it goes back to the other camera so you end up having a scenario
[19535.16s -> 19541.40s]  sometimes where you are trying to run or do something and the and the camera angle changes
[19541.40s -> 19550.39s]  like four times in 10 seconds it's it's unnerving that's the number one reason why i don't like it
[19552.60s -> 19558.74s]  now if it was a truly fixed camera it would be hard to do that i mean just only one angle but
[19558.74s -> 19569.19s]  yeah you can't do that i mean it's impossible i don't know that me saying this is like oh fps
[19569.19s -> 19574.07s]  these fucking zoomer millennials he wants he wants to shoot things he wants it to be a shooter
[19574.07s -> 19581.78s]  he wants a third person first person he wants to shoot things he's a shooter i know i know and i
[19581.78s -> 19588.30s]  look i get that argument too when both sides are upset with each other that's how you know
[19588.30s -> 19594.65s]  that you came to a true compromise larry david up down left right there he is my that's my guy
[19599.02s -> 19609.35s]  he's like wait why is he why is he god i just did i did like the father son and i looked up and i um
[19609.43s -> 19621.83s]  okay larry centrist dave no larry david don't how dare you larry david is unbelievable and
[19621.83s -> 19631.03s]  he's i would take a larry david god if larry david just came out and was like you know i i
[19631.03s -> 19648.60s]  think i'm gone and everyone agreed i'd be fine with it i'll be like this is actually kind of good
[19648.60s -> 19665.48s]  and the first thing i'm gonna do is introduce fixed cameras i was waiting for the reaction for that
[19665.48s -> 19671.74s]  one because i wasn't i wouldn't feel in that one all right though i think some of you might be
[19671.74s -> 19678.38s]  too tired to do the minus button at this point you were like reaching over like
[19679.42s -> 19690.20s]  fucking tired i don't know who cares oh i've done it i've done it like 200 times today

[20228.66s -> 20235.88s]  borgs like g red it's a very small but cute detail on some of them also you might want to try
[20237.24s -> 20244.89s]  chozu ju mecha mg it's like gotcha force with giant robots made by the edf devs and got a fan

[20252.94s -> 20267.37s]  upside down and look under the yes okay and then that other one is that a good game put it on the
[20267.37s -> 20271.90s]  list bro put it make sure you guys put in these in the recommended channel i skim through that
[20271.90s -> 20276.38s]  and i pull tons of stuff from there every month or two really it's where half of these games even
[20277.02s -> 20285.51s]  they came from the first place but thanks for the five dollars curr bumble and the that's we'll
[20285.51s -> 20290.62s]  check it out tomorrow news and coffee thanks for 250 i said it before and i'll say it again
[20290.62s -> 20295.30s]  i don't understand what's going on here anyway just me again i want to say thanks for showing
[20295.30s -> 20299.78s]  this super cool game and blah blah okay whatever that's it i'm honestly sick and tired of this guy
[20299.78s -> 20303.86s]  no this is not the message this is real i don't care how much money you give me i won't play god
[20303.86s -> 20322.14s]  hand ever now get lost you're banned so do it get lost why would you say that come on i'm not gonna
[20322.14s -> 20329.69s]  play god hand i'm sick of it i'm sick of hearing about it i'll probably play that like in a few
[20329.69s -> 20336.98s]  weeks hey drosophila thanks for 250 basically your big earth theory needs to be upgraded to a
[20336.98s -> 20346.12s]  humongous earth theory sincerely a huge space nerd this is important this is really important
[20346.12s -> 20364.17s]  this is like a this is another scientist here let's take a look at this it's a big ass days
[20364.17s -> 20371.98s]  are defined by the earth's rotation yeah that's what i said half of earth is illuminated by the
[20371.98s -> 20377.45s]  sun while the other half is in its shadow right the sun is a giant sphere beaming light in all
[20377.45s -> 20386.06s]  directions okay sure the earth is 100 million miles away from the sun fun fact an earth that's
[20386.06s -> 20394.33s]  a hundred times the diameter is approximately the size of the sun what i thought the sun was
[20394.33s -> 20399.70s]  just a really bright gumdrop it's that big i thought it was like as big as a fucking like
[20399.70s -> 20412.44s]  chevy malibu fucking i'm kidding holy shit a fun fact in earth that's a hundred times the diameter
[20412.44s -> 20425.18s]  is probably size yeah okay in both cases the sun shines on half of the sphere that is the earth
[20425.18s -> 20430.70s]  right the only way that the spotlight effect could take place or there could be a substantial
[20430.70s -> 20437.58s]  difference between night and day is if the sun was a point light extremely close to the earth
[20438.14s -> 20453.91s]  or if the earth was thousands of times bigger than the sun well what would happen that oh
[20454.63s -> 20466.47s]  we tried to tell you i look as a thought project thanks the 250 and that's cool i'm glad people
[20466.47s -> 20476.58s]  are figuring this stuff up i could be your teacher i will see you tomorrow thanks for

[20517.93s -> 20522.09s]  ps if you're ever thinking about playing the prototype biohazard bundle it's on sale for
[20522.09s -> 20527.43s]  12 dollars until tomorrow i think you'd be right up your alley much love thanks for everything

[20539.54s -> 20546.57s]  with streaming them because i own prototype one and prototype two i had a bunch of obs problems
[20546.57s -> 20550.09s]  the game couldn't be captured right it was all messed up it was glitchy it was laggy

[20632.41s -> 20636.65s]  there's always something so horrible when you hear about that kind of stuff
[20639.56s -> 20646.42s]  it's just you feel so awful because you know if somebody takes something from you
[20646.98s -> 20651.29s]  whether it's something you've it's a something you've owned for a long time or something that's

[20659.30s -> 20664.42s]  it scary to think about that i'm really sorry that happened that sucks hopefully you can either get
