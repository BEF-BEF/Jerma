[6.20s -> 18.04s]  Hey, how are you? Welcome to the stream. Good afternoon. Sorry, it was a little tied up.
[19.22s -> 38.94s]  Available now. Today we're going to be playing Nancy Drew, Midnight in Salem. You're probably
[38.94s -> 48.71s]  wondering what's the bet that I lost. One guy strikes again. And this is actually one guy
[49.27s -> 59.58s]  from yesterday or the day before. So somebody said this and it just, hey, do Nancy Drew. I would love
[59.58s -> 66.14s]  it. I'm like, oh, why would I fucking ever do this? And the two days went by or day went by. I slept
[66.14s -> 73.59s]  on it and I woke up and I'm like, yeah, okay. I mean, they are, let me be fair. They were at least
[73.59s -> 80.82s]  another like 30 or 40. One guy is in the game. Uh, not in the game, in the chat before the stream
[80.82s -> 86.62s]  started that also said this is a good idea. Why did you pick the worst Nancy Drew? This one just
[86.62s -> 92.70s]  released. This one just came out. This is the brand new one. This is the one that came out literally
[92.70s -> 103.30s]  two days ago. This one sucks. You guys act like I don't have at least three, four to 10 Nancy Drew
[103.30s -> 114.70s]  games on backup, ready to go. This one sucks ass. This one sucks ass. That person was not happy
[114.70s -> 120.62s]  about it. There's 32. There's, there's, there's, there's as many Nancy Drew games as I've had
[120.62s -> 127.02s]  birthdays. Just play them all. Why would I, that's not, that's not going to happen. It would have to
[127.02s -> 132.46s]  take something extreme for me. I would have to play for 20 minutes in this and go, yep, we're
[132.46s -> 148.70s]  doing all of them. Play them all. Play them all. Stream. Money stream to force German to play them
[148.70s -> 155.11s]  all. No, that would not work. I'm going to tell you right now, those of you that are like, oh yeah,
[155.11s -> 161.03s]  money, let's money stream and he'll do it. I'm not going to do it. So if there, if you do a money
[161.03s -> 166.95s]  stream, just be aware that is not going to do anything. That's not going to do anything.
[168.09s -> 176.50s]  That's not going to make me play Nancy Drew one for 32. Just to make sure we're aware of that.
[178.23s -> 184.09s]  But now this continues of our non-canon week. And what that means is every stream you've seen this
[184.09s -> 189.77s]  week didn't happen. None of these are canon. They've all, they're all in the extended universe.
[195.34s -> 201.99s]  So knowing that it's like, fuck it, let's play Nancy Drew, Midnight in Salem. You know,
[202.71s -> 213.14s]  fuck it. Didn't miss anything canon. No, not yet. So this is the, this is the one that came up two
[213.14s -> 222.50s]  days ago. And here's the thing about this. I have never played any, a single second of Nancy Drew.
[223.06s -> 228.23s]  So this is all new to me. I haven't played any, I've been one time in college,
[230.15s -> 236.07s]  Nancy Drew two. I do remember friends of mine were actually playing it in the dorm rooms there.
[236.07s -> 240.15s]  So they had, they had the hookup where they could do more than three, four computers together. So
[242.15s -> 246.63s]  I got to see it. I sat down and I did a little bit of a puzzle for like two minutes and I was like,
[246.63s -> 248.95s]  all right, whatever. And there's a lot of these, I know this is a really, really established
[248.95s -> 258.01s]  franchise, but I've never done it. So, and this is a scary one and somebody's house is burning down.
[259.00s -> 261.96s]  Somebody gave $50. It's not going to do anything. It's not going to do anything.
[263.45s -> 268.97s]  I'm going to, okay, let's put a bracket here. Thanks for the $5,000. It's not going to do anything.
[269.91s -> 275.90s]  Thank you for, no, 5,000 bits. But if you tell me to play Nancy Drew four,
[275.90s -> 280.30s]  cause it's your favorite one, I'm not going to play it. Did someone say money stream also heard
[280.30s -> 285.34s]  you were offering private streams for $5,000 in McDonald's gift cards. I'll get on that,
[285.34s -> 287.90s]  but this is non-canon. This whole week is not canon. So that's not real.
[288.62s -> 293.72s]  Something that you should know about Nancy Drew, midnight in Salem, which is actually very,
[293.72s -> 303.70s]  very interesting. Um, there are like FPS game graphic settings in this game, real time
[303.70s -> 310.84s]  reflections, anti-aliasing, post-process shadow, shadow quality. There are more options in here
[310.84s -> 321.51s]  than I've seen in a lot of actual FPS releases, right? Look at this. They weren't fucking around
[323.54s -> 330.22s]  non-descript civilian. Thanks to the five community subs, this is more options than halo reach.
[330.86s -> 345.80s]  No, it doesn't. They have all these options, but it still has unity grass. Well, just let's give it
[345.80s -> 362.76s]  a, just let's give it a little bit. Okay. Unity. Yeah. All right. Here we go. New game difficulty
[362.76s -> 372.84s]  amateur sloth, master sloth as sleuth. And I feel, okay, this is, remember, this is a game for,
[374.33s -> 380.09s]  this is a game for like 15 year olds or something. This is like a 12 year old game, right?
[380.81s -> 388.17s]  So an amateur, an amateur 12 year old versus a master 12 year old. I think this is, this is like
[388.17s -> 404.74s]  for an adult like me, this is like, no, I have to do master. This is a kid's game. British accent,
[404.74s -> 420.02s]  British accent, British. Fuck. Get an old relic.
[428.10s -> 434.87s]  That's fucking terrifying. You don't want to go here. Oh, the place is supposed to be haunted.
[434.87s -> 439.67s]  So yeah, I might get killed in here. I might get fucking eaten by a demon, but oh,
[439.67s -> 445.43s]  I'm looking forward to the scares. It feels like ages since I was on my last adventure.
[448.15s -> 456.84s]  So are you coming in? Miss Drew, I prefer to stay out here. Is it an FPS? It's so
[457.64s -> 467.38s]  warm and inviting in here. Where am I? Is this my house? Suel's effects are there. Just as your
[467.38s -> 475.22s]  father requested. This house is fucked. I just write letters in my fucking crumbling house.
[480.54s -> 499.05s]  I haven't been to the grocery store in like fucking years. Click to move. No, it's a click.
[499.05s -> 506.34s]  What is this tablet version? Hey, it's like, hey, just to let you know, get this on your iPad.
[506.34s -> 521.24s]  It's probably better. Oh, that was easy. That's not a good view. That's a terrible view. It's
[521.24s -> 529.18s]  just trees. I mean, I guess that the mountain's kind of cool. Click on the screen just to turn.
[529.18s -> 548.76s]  Yeah. What's going on in here? Is this person talking to me while we're both in the bathroom
[548.76s -> 563.85s]  and they're in the stall while I'm washing my hands? And then somebody else comes in the
[563.85s -> 570.57s]  bathroom and you're like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, hey, stop talking. It's odd what we're
[570.57s -> 577.48s]  doing because they don't know that somebody just, oh yeah, we just came into the bathroom, but
[577.72s -> 581.72s]  like just us two, it's like, nobody says Alice is here. You're in the stall. I'm like just
[581.72s -> 586.36s]  doing my, I'm just like fucking shaving. I'm like picking my nose hairs out and you're just
[586.36s -> 591.00s]  talking. You're just monologuing to me from the stall. And then some old guy walks in
[591.88s -> 602.31s]  and I don't think, just slow down. All right, interact. Hold to look. I found a letter.
[603.03s -> 609.75s]  It's addressed to Abigail Hathorne Woodley. What does it say? I do regret to write to you in this
[609.75s -> 616.31s]  state. I have been wracked with guilt as my fervency of spirit was too great to determine
[616.31s -> 621.59s]  a conviction. Just Nancy, just sell this. This is probably worth like eight grand for gods.
[622.39s -> 629.59s]  Somebody else will read this way. I have to read this, don't I? I regret to write you in
[629.59s -> 634.55s]  the state of wracked with guilt as my spirit is too great to determine conviction. Just
[634.55s -> 641.83s]  relentlessly have I cried at his mercy, longing for his light to bathe my conscious clean. Wait,
[641.83s -> 652.07s]  read. You read it. To write the wrongs I made in zealous blindness, I'm writing a book I call
[652.07s -> 659.27s]  the Book of Apologies. To be worthy of his mercy, I'm traveling the world to note down all the names
[659.27s -> 664.71s]  of those wrongfully accused of witchcraft. Let this be my final legacy, my only way to write the
[664.71s -> 671.32s]  wrongs I've helped create. My guilt allows me not to ask for forgiveness, though know that my soul
[671.32s -> 681.11s]  remains forever tortured by the knowledge of what I have done. All right, any like fucking codes?
[684.57s -> 692.28s]  Ooh, here we go. You didn't think I was gonna click on this shit, did you?
[693.00s -> 701.93s]  Press the secret button, go into grandpa's secret compartment. I wouldn't do this. No, I wouldn't
[701.93s -> 706.65s]  do this. I wouldn't. Because if like, I don't know, if like grandpa has like a secret fucking door in
[706.65s -> 711.45s]  a compartment and shit, I don't know what's in here. They could be drugs. They could be like,
[711.53s -> 715.61s]  I don't know, this is like porn collection from like fucking like the 40s or stuff. I don't want
[715.61s -> 732.04s]  this. In fact, I would probably I would just burn this thing. I don't know what's in here. I need
[732.04s -> 737.50s]  a key that shaped like a U. This is on master difficulty, just so you guys know. I'm going to
[737.50s -> 747.56s]  examine. Okay, that's scary. Dr. Hurst? Yes. Yes, I'm here. Just come in the room. Why are you
[747.56s -> 756.84s]  standing outside the door? Just come into the room? And why is there dialogue options? What else can
[756.84s -> 761.00s]  you tell me about the book of apologies? I want to know. What else can you tell me about the book
[761.00s -> 767.64s]  of apologies? As I mentioned, it's the book written by Judge Samuel Sewell himself, detailing
[767.64s -> 773.56s]  the names of people accused of witchcraft. Sewell was one of the very few judges who regretted his
[773.56s -> 778.28s]  actions. You take a long time in the bathroom, by the way. You have places to go. Sewell himself
[778.28s -> 785.35s]  was originally from England, but acted as a judge in the Salem witch trials. Do you perhaps know why?
[785.43s -> 789.59s]  The whole game is played with the vote. Just out of curiosity, of course. It's
[790.31s -> 796.71s]  just such a very unusual request. He's looking into it as a favor for the current judge in Salem.
[796.71s -> 804.65s]  Oh, how much is that fucking making you guys angry? Not only is there a cursor on the screen always,
[804.65s -> 809.85s]  but it's moving. So I have to look at it. Humans are like cats. That's why nobody wants a cursor
[809.85s -> 813.50s]  on the screen. Because if I go over here, you know, me, I just went through the right. If I go this
[813.50s -> 820.44s]  way, you're following it right now. I am. So are you. You're looking, right? Ready? You're looking
[820.44s -> 823.00s]  in the lower left portion of the screen right now. And by the way, we're going to take it. We're
[823.00s -> 828.52s]  going to do a theory here and we'll see in like, in like 30 minutes, I'm going to tell you exactly
[828.52s -> 832.04s]  where you're looking. And it's going to be that one of those magic trick shows where like you got
[832.04s -> 841.70s]  to participate. All right. Who cares? Let's go. All right. Every desk, there's going to be like
[841.70s -> 850.89s]  one ring. Wow. The hammer of witches itself gives me chills knowing what it did. Yes.
