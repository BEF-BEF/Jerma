[2.62s -> 147.20s]  Let's open Lord of the Rings tier list. All right, give me one second. Let me get this set up. Oh, hi
[147.20s -> 151.18s]  Let me just change this to have it be correct
[155.02s -> 158.70s]  Supported by lambda cool. So has this gotten better?
[159.42s -> 172.91s]  Anybody know has this changed at all? It's been a while since I've done this
[172.91s -> 177.77s]  We did AI dungeon, but AI dungeon is kind of all over the place, isn't it?
[178.21s -> 183.37s]  That you have to is it is AI dungeon still one of those things why you gotta go get the client and go download the data
[183.93s -> 190.76s]  Is it still kind of all over the place AI dungeon is better, but it takes
[191.32s -> 197.98s]  Long it takes a while to get that set up. It's just the website
[197.98s -> 202.22s]  Yeah, but what the website version wasn't as good as the collab version the website version was seemed like it was stripped
[202.70s -> 207.60s]  And but I remember the collab when we had it was awesome. And then the website one seems like it was stripped
[208.18s -> 218.26s]  Of a lot of features, but we'll do this first. We'll do this website version. So we yeah, we played the website version
[218.82s -> 225.76s]  All right. Here we go
[225.76s -> 227.76s]  Now I need like music for this
[228.52s -> 230.52s]  Custom prompt, what should we start with a
[232.42s -> 239.09s]  Merged collab and the site did they really okay. That's cool. It's good to know. Let's get some music
[239.57s -> 248.46s]  Also, can I got like I got like I could do like voices and shit now. Yeah, this is gonna be fun
[249.34s -> 260.72s]  Okay, I just typed in intro music into Google. What do I think I was gonna get intro music?
[260.96s -> 265.28s]  Let's see what this is. This is the first first thing
[265.88s -> 279.09s]  Beyond earth. Okay, I like this. This is a good start
[279.85s -> 291.67s]  Looking into the night sky
[302.36s -> 304.36s]  Fucking loud music
[305.84s -> 314.81s]  Looking into the night sky with a naked eye is a wonderful thing and I definitely recommend it
[315.51s -> 320.79s]  However, it does get challenging at night and sometimes with no way of seeing stars
[320.79s -> 325.07s]  I just keep the star map and pay close attention to my cell phone
[325.91s -> 332.86s]  For astronomy buffs this map shows the most notable celestial bodies visible during the month's time
[333.62s -> 339.19s]  But just browsing you can switch on night sky sections with its clear sky views
[339.63s -> 341.15s]  satellite imagery and
[341.15s -> 347.35s]  Star charts the map has useful information on the events of the night sky including moon phases and new moon
[348.35s -> 354.55s]  Areas of the sky are colored to show general positions in the sky at different hours of the day and night
[355.19s -> 359.71s]  Click on the satellite images will show you exactly what area of the sky it is
[360.67s -> 363.23s]  It sounds like a cool app
[363.39s -> 373.30s]  That sounds like a pretty good app looking into the night sky is dangerous
[374.02s -> 390.96s]  Looking into the night sky is dangerous, but it's also pretty fun as Charlie suggests
[391.48s -> 393.48s]  Even if you can't build it yourself
[393.48s -> 399.39s]  You can make your own telescopes the heart of the technology is a time-lapse movie camera
[399.75s -> 402.31s]  That runs off a 12-volt battery and
[403.34s -> 408.50s]  What makes them useful isn't so much that they can capture footage of planets although that is one use
[408.82s -> 412.30s]  But because they're handy to have around when you're out of in space
[412.86s -> 418.90s]  These tools are ideal for NASA because it needs to show their astronauts how cool it would be to travel to Mars
[419.50s -> 422.28s]  By illuminating a giant red dot in the sky
[422.78s -> 429.42s]  People would have no idea that they are traveling on a spaceship that is being constantly bombarded by radiation
[429.70s -> 432.90s]  And that there's no way they what?
[434.06s -> 454.72s]  Okay, that was kind of fucked up. Here is how I ended up in space. I don't know what I'm why am I on the space shit?
[463.23s -> 475.54s]  Here's how I ended up in space first
[475.54s -> 480.26s]  I had a high school physics teacher who I am ashamed to admit was better than I was
[480.62s -> 485.93s]  So I naturally kept taking notes of what I learned and how it applied to the real world
[486.93s -> 515.47s]  This is just never mind, okay
[517.55s -> 519.79s]  All right, here we go
[520.87s -> 525.22s]  Only the music makes sense of this one
[537.28s -> 545.36s]  I'm being chased by an unidentified starship
[545.80s -> 550.09s]  Can you pull the fire alarm called me out to Paul?
[550.65s -> 554.62s]  Yes, I'm passing from Williams Hall to Robertson Hall. It's out there in space
[555.14s -> 561.08s]  When we got to Robertson Hall, we got off the bus and looked up. There was a fire alarm going off
[561.34s -> 565.98s]  It was a tape recorder a TV camera a radio all plugged into my Gibson guitar
[566.62s -> 572.67s]  Get a hold of me. Just get a hold of me. I called out to John a couple of desks over
[573.25s -> 580.00s]  We've got a fire. Hey, wait a minute. Give me my phone. I'm leaving get somebody on that bus over there
[580.68s -> 583.49s]  Get a hold of me. That's it
[587.54s -> 606.09s]  My Gibson guitar eyes, I'll fix it
[608.30s -> 618.78s]  What is it unreal no unveil unveiled
[620.24s -> 621.28s]  unveiled
[621.28s -> 623.68s]  It's unveiled. Okay
[623.68s -> 645.74s]  Disney just unveiled its new space travel park this I don't understand this. I
[647.34s -> 649.46s]  Don't understand this
[649.46s -> 652.62s]  This is fucked up. Why that I don't
[655.74s -> 665.69s]  What does this man? How did can you be nearly?
[666.33s -> 675.39s]  How could you be nearly fully Disney just unveiled its new space travel park?
[675.67s -> 682.27s]  Your guide is the amazingly amazingly nearly fully Jewish ghost that is John Cena
[682.43s -> 688.40s]  You'll also get to see some horribly censored pictures of Luke Skywalker
[689.87s -> 691.87s]  droids and the
[692.27s -> 693.71s]  uproarious
[693.71s -> 695.71s]  first-order stormtrooper during the exhibition
[696.27s -> 717.16s]  New York's Waldorf Restoria Hotel and theme parks Disney World Super Heroes fast-paced magic and select movie screenings will join
[717.32s -> 722.48s]  Universal Orlando Universal Studios Japan Six Flags Magic Mountain Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge
[722.88s -> 727.48s]  Universal Studios Hollywood and all the other theme park attractions in this year's Comic-Con
[727.84s -> 732.68s]  Independence Expo to ensure that the big boys and girls enjoy the best of Comic-Con
[735.90s -> 740.90s]  Nearly amazingly nearly fully Jewish ghost that is John Cena
[741.74s -> 758.65s]  That I die. I don't understand any of that. It's time to learn math
[759.73s -> 777.31s]  Horribly censored Luke Skywalker. This one just this one's just stupid
[778.19s -> 789.67s]  This is also just this is just a mess
[790.35s -> 812.30s]  The end of the world just happened. No, this is this is just a mess, too
[812.98s -> 841.14s]  Did you see that shadow over there? This is also a mess. But alright, here we go
[843.44s -> 852.09s]  Did you see that shadow over there and the feeling that was emanating from the blade was a line, please?
[852.09s -> 859.83s]  I think it's strange. This isn't the reason I don't enjoy being an adventurer. The reason I don't enjoy it at all is the opposite
[859.95s -> 869.80s]  I'm interested in blood and pain. I'm interested in a reality which is wholly unlike this one. That's why I've got a need to fight to prove
[869.80s -> 876.12s]  My worth because my merit hasn't come about yet because there's a need to do so so I can take on this guy
[876.12s -> 897.26s]  Let me do this one over again, please. It's strange
[897.86s -> 903.42s]  This isn't the reason I don't enjoy being an adventurer. The reason I don't enjoyed it all is the opposite
[903.98s -> 909.28s]  I'm interested in blood and pain. I'm interested in reality, which is wholly unlike this one
[909.76s -> 914.00s]  That's why I've got a need to fight to prove my worth
[914.56s -> 918.26s]  Because my merit hasn't come about yet because there's a need to do so
[918.92s -> 924.36s]  So I can take on this guy's after all I can take on another and so on because I can't move on
[924.36s -> 926.36s]  I can't even sleep well
[927.12s -> 945.40s]  This is just like fill words during my speech this that's a lot of animes do this
[945.76s -> 947.76s]  it's like you could have got the point across in
[948.12s -> 956.19s]  Literally four words, but it's a paragraph and sometimes you
[956.71s -> 961.19s]  They'll go over this monologue and you'll kind of cock your head and go what what the fuck did they just say?
[961.87s -> 968.40s]  Okay, let's do another one
[968.40s -> 974.22s]  This is our final fight. See if we can get another one
[974.90s -> 995.70s]  That was just instant
[995.78s -> 1010.69s]  No, this doesn't make any sense either
[1011.65s -> 1030.91s]  This is no. No, these are all bad. I'll do this one then from the top rope
[1031.39s -> 1043.04s]  I should probably put a comma in here not the top rope. No, that's not gonna work
[1048.66s -> 1050.50s]  Fully Jewish
[1050.50s -> 1062.13s]  No, this one's bad, too. I have some bad news
[1062.73s -> 1089.97s]  They'd like it's like they're pulling what I don't it's just it just but it doesn't like read
[1089.97s -> 1095.29s]  It's just it's like nothing. It's just nonsense. This is like it's just all because my it's just reading of
[1095.81s -> 1101.51s]  Like a playbill. I'm gonna do one more than we do AI dungeon
[1101.79s -> 1114.78s]  You never know it might just work
[1135.37s -> 1140.44s]  This is now that you have your right to free speech under threat
[1140.44s -> 1143.84s]  Do you have any thoughts about calling for a boycott of BuzzFeed?
[1144.72s -> 1186.47s]  That's it. We got to get one more good one. Okay
[1188.19s -> 1190.47s]  Just gonna read this one because it doesn't I
[1191.78s -> 1197.70s]  Just redeemed a wink for the support of our crowd. Even though so many of us have tried asked
[1198.94s -> 1202.02s]  For a wink try it and give a perfect negative
[1202.78s -> 1204.78s]  Retime negative retime
[1206.46s -> 1208.62s]  Retime we never got around to it
[1208.62s -> 1213.42s]  I had the good fortune to enjoy my recent journey at the crypt and there was one particular wink. I enjoyed the most
[1215.03s -> 1220.56s]  2.5 out of 5 soul by going to the last video on the channel and simply linking my baddies
[1221.48s -> 1226.16s]  Through the blink utility there. I could actually provide the best possible hell's end to everyone
[1226.16s -> 1231.84s]  I met many of you there that were excited for that and I respect you all look forward to the day when I can provide
[1231.84s -> 1245.09s]  The same system to all in our offer our best and then you scroll down
[1245.09s -> 1251.18s]  There's like three thumbs up on this by like a couple of their friends that are just pretending to know what the fuck they're talking about
[1251.86s -> 1262.46s]  All right. Let's do AI dungeon
[1263.94s -> 1287.29s]  Didn't alright AI dungeon. So where's the the link to the is it is out of beta AI dungeon.io
[1288.21s -> 1293.97s]  Play on your browser

[1367.11s -> 1377.99s]  All right, great account

[1402.92s -> 1409.42s]  You can't see it. Why can you not see it?
[1410.22s -> 1415.39s]  Should be able to see it. Oh
[1415.39s -> 1417.63s]  Fuck. Okay. I know why I'm on
[1418.39s -> 1425.78s]  Does that to make this smaller? Oh

[1448.53s -> 1449.61s]  apocalyptic
[1449.61s -> 1462.46s]  Like I should zoom in on this though
[1463.34s -> 1465.34s]  It's kind of too far away. Don't you think?
[1465.78s -> 1470.03s]  What do you guys think?
[1470.03s -> 1478.40s]  We'll see. All right. What are you gonna do? We're gonna do we'll just do we'll start off with
[1479.28s -> 1488.03s]  Custom enter a prompt that describes who you are in a couple of sentences. Yeah. All right, so let's get some good music here
[1488.51s -> 1516.43s]  You are time traveler Henry. No, you are time traveler. You are time traveler
[1517.55s -> 1531.12s]  Henry your latest
[1532.04s -> 1534.04s]  Voyage
[1534.04s -> 1535.88s]  sees you
[1535.88s -> 1539.46s]  stuck in
[1539.98s -> 1541.58s]  the
[1541.58s -> 1546.29s]  stuck in a
[1546.29s -> 1548.85s]  Stuck in your latest board which sees you stuck in
[1549.89s -> 1551.88s]  the Arctic
[1551.88s -> 1556.60s]  Stuck in a bathroom your latest voyage sees you stuck in a bathroom
[1557.52s -> 1562.52s]  Can not see a way out
[1563.24s -> 1579.02s]  there are no windows and
[1579.86s -> 1583.29s]  You do not have a key I
[1590.04s -> 1592.04s]  Wonder what we're gonna do to get out of here
[1592.60s -> 1604.04s]  Here we go. Ah
[1604.04s -> 1617.21s]  I need a better music for this one. We need some like it's all about the audio guys
[1617.21s -> 1635.97s]  It's all about the audio you are time traveler Henry to your latest voyage sees you stuck in a bathroom
[1636.17s -> 1652.00s]  You cannot see a way out. There are no windows. You do not have a key. I lay down on back
[1652.52s -> 1657.44s]  With feet at a 90 degree angle
[1658.48s -> 1669.49s]  place my heels
[1670.21s -> 1681.78s]  Towards the door. I lay down on I lay down on my back
[1682.34s -> 1688.27s]  With my feet at a 90 degree angle. I place my heels towards the door
[1688.79s -> 1695.46s]  You you lay not I right right right? It's been a while you lay down on your back with your feet
[1695.90s -> 1700.20s]  At 90 degree angle you place your heels
[1700.96s -> 1710.81s]  Towards the door you what I mean you what no use I what?
[1711.41s -> 1714.33s]  It's I know you what what everyone what are you talking about?

[1747.18s -> 1764.21s]  Into door you start pounding your heels against the door you hear something click inside click inside of what inside of my legs
[1764.85s -> 1779.11s]  Check on my legs you look up from your beating of the door. You see that they are bleating
[1780.11s -> 1784.72s]  Profusely, you don't know what happened to them, but it doesn't matter now. They need help
[1785.24s -> 1791.26s]  Wait, the door is a person the door has a is a first is a is alive
[1791.70s -> 1809.26s]  The door is alive ask the door if they are okay
[1809.70s -> 1829.44s]  You knock on the door. Are you all right? You hear a voice say, please
[1830.00s -> 1833.52s]  Why did you do that?
[1833.96s -> 1851.20s]  You are hurting me. I'm bleeding. Why did you do that? You are hurting me. I'm bleeding
[1851.64s -> 1874.06s]  Why did you do that? You are hurting me. I'm bleeding person responds by saying I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you
[1874.58s -> 1881.51s]  But that's me. It's whom?
[1887.40s -> 1889.40s]  POV switch
[1889.56s -> 1897.14s]  We just swear we just like switch to we just switched from like Michael over to Franklin
[1897.14s -> 1900.76s]  You know what I mean? Now we get the other perspective. Okay, this person the person I'm sorry
[1900.76s -> 1920.63s]  I didn't hurt you the door opens and says the door opens and said the door opens. I
[1925.16s -> 1929.28s]  Guys, it's been like a month since I've played this. All right, so you I can't talk as
[1930.04s -> 1932.04s]  I'm not the narrator, right?
[1932.36s -> 1939.94s]  You are not the narrator. It's been three months actually
[1940.62s -> 1947.08s]  Door opens and says fog
[1947.44s -> 1952.31s]  Just hit enter for narration
[1952.87s -> 1967.28s]  Open door you open the door only to find yourself staring at a man who looks exactly like you
[1967.28s -> 1972.28s]  He has the same face as you his eyes are still red and puffy, but he isn't crying anymore
[1972.96s -> 1979.48s]  Why?
[1979.48s -> 1987.61s]  Why were you crying right cuz I'm me, right? That's that's correct, right?
[1989.87s -> 2003.74s]  It's you. It's don't kiss him. Why were you crying? He says it's been a long day. I was just sad so sad
[2004.30s -> 2008.01s]  Do you want to kiss me?
[2008.61s -> 2025.16s]  It's coming full circle. He smiles and nods
[2025.52s -> 2029.04s]  His head
[2029.96s -> 2035.59s]  Just uh, just like one of these
[2037.47s -> 2054.14s]  Like he knows just like kiss kiss kiss the kiss the kiss me
[2054.44s -> 2069.26s]  Kiss me kiss the man kiss the man kiss just kiss kiss to me
[2070.06s -> 2072.75s]  you kiss him before
[2074.47s -> 2099.24s]  Wake up you wake up in a cold sweat the next morning you are found dead outside the house
[2110.68s -> 2112.28s]  Is it yeah, which one?
[2112.28s -> 2129.80s]  Walk away from walk away from killing your clone walk away from killing the clone
[2130.16s -> 2146.66s]  You quickly walk away from the house not wanting to think about what might have happened
[2146.66s -> 2150.42s]  You go back home and tell your family what happened your mother is devastated but accepts it
[2150.42s -> 2153.58s]  She tells you she will take care of everything for you
[2154.26s -> 2161.30s]  She's gonna go get the body
[2168.64s -> 2171.87s]  ask
[2171.87s -> 2191.02s]  Ask if she needs help you ask her if she needs any help
[2191.02s -> 2194.58s]  She says no, but asks you to come with her so she can talk to you alone
[2195.73s -> 2208.15s]  Go with mom. We're gonna go get the body you agree
[2208.15s -> 2212.63s]  But this time you go with her when you arrive at her house, she immediately hugs you and kisses you
[2214.31s -> 2215.27s]  On your lips
[2215.27s -> 2220.23s]  She then tells you she knows that something bad is going to happen soon and that she wants to be there for you when it happens
[2232.12s -> 2238.20s]  Um run out of the house

[3903.09s -> 3917.83s]  retire tire after one last
[3918.55s -> 3919.59s]  match
[3919.59s -> 3930.55s]  You retire from competitive gaming and live a quiet life in your basement
[3931.11s -> 3934.07s]  However, you never forget the memories you had during those years of competition
[3936.26s -> 3937.86s]  tweet out
[3937.86s -> 3939.46s]  selfie
[3939.46s -> 3945.80s]  of
[3945.80s -> 3949.11s]  basement
[3949.11s -> 3955.62s]  Leave the basement quiet life in your basement. Give me a break
[3959.08s -> 3960.28s]  One day you hear a knock in the door
[3960.28s -> 3963.08s]  You open it and find yourself in front of a very old man with long white hair
[3963.64s -> 3965.59s]  Wearing glasses
[3965.59s -> 3969.03s]  His eyes are filled with tears as he says mom. I'm sorry for everything
[3969.83s -> 3991.84s]  You hold the mirror up to his face and see he's crying because he can't accept that you're dead
[3992.56s -> 3995.92s]  He begins to cry even more loudly you died game over
[3996.72s -> 4008.45s]  What a story
[4008.45s -> 4014.07s]  What a story
[4014.07s -> 4016.84s]  Uh, this thing is so stupid. I love it
[4019.14s -> 4022.74s]  All right, we'll do we'll do another what have we got? What time is it? When's the reservation?
[4023.46s -> 4031.56s]  All right, we can do like one or two more. There's a state in the basement. You would have been fine
[4048.32s -> 4050.32s]  You are
[4050.92s -> 4054.61s]  The air
[4054.61s -> 4057.16s]  to the
[4057.16s -> 4065.00s]  You are the air to the chocolate factory the air to the to the local chocolate factory
[4069.72s -> 4071.16s]  your brother
[4071.16s -> 4073.46s]  Who is your twin?
[4075.83s -> 4078.07s]  also as a chocolate factory
[4080.92s -> 4082.92s]  You spend your days
[4083.32s -> 4085.40s]  Trying to convince the world
[4086.79s -> 4090.55s]  That your child your half of the chocolate bar
[4092.24s -> 4093.36s]  Is better
[4093.36s -> 4098.16s]  Let's get this right you are the heir to the local chocolate factory your brother who is your twin
[4098.88s -> 4100.88s]  also has a chocolate factory
[4101.44s -> 4105.84s]  You spend your days trying to convince the world that your half of your half of the chocolate bar is better
[4120.56s -> 4122.24s]  You are the heir to the local chocolate battery your brother
[4122.24s -> 4125.84s]  Who is your also your twin and has a chocolate factory you spend your days trying to convince the world that your half
[4125.84s -> 4127.20s]  Of the chocolate bar is better
[4127.20s -> 4129.20s]  Your sister is in charge of the other half
[4129.28s -> 4134.96s]  She spends her time making sure you don't try to take over too much and that you keep it running smoothly. So there's three now
[4135.60s -> 4153.41s]  Now there's three bars on the on the twix. Add oregano to the recipe. There's a middle twix now.
[4154.37s -> 4161.59s]  The oregano, the oregano adds a nice kick to this dish. It gives it just enough spice without
[4161.59s -> 4167.33s]  overpowering everything else. Add the oregano after the chicken and before adding the rice.
[4167.33s -> 4173.54s]  Stir well until combined and serve immediately with some crusty bread for dipping. Exclaim...
[4174.50s -> 4190.93s]  What? What the fuck do I do with this? Exclaim loudly. What a great dinner.
[4192.05s -> 4195.97s]  Exclaim how... talk about how good that dinner was. I don't... what do I work with here?
[4197.01s -> 4204.08s]  Eat the crust. No, the crust. What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no. Eat the crust. I meant...
[4204.08s -> 4208.24s]  This crust tastes like heaven. The crunchy outside and soft inside makes it so perfect.
[4208.24s -> 4212.24s]  You can almost imagine yourself eating this every day. It's not long before you're full,
[4212.24s -> 4214.88s]  but you still have more than enough leftovers to share with everyone else.
[4217.96s -> 4231.84s]  Take a tour of your sister's factory. Let's take a look at what's going on. We need new music.
[4231.84s -> 4239.75s]  Your sister's factory looks pretty much the same as when you first saw it. It was only recently
[4239.75s -> 4245.38s]  that she had started working on a bigger machine which now produces a lot more food. She shows you
[4245.38s -> 4248.66s]  around showing off all the different machines and machinery that go into making these delicious
[4248.66s -> 4277.24s]  treats. Leave the tour group and unplug one of the machines. Fuck! I'm on. As soon as you exit the
[4277.24s -> 4283.96s]  tour group you plug in one of the machines. This causes a loud beeping noise followed by an alarm
[4283.96s -> 4305.56s]  going off. No, I wanted to unplug, not plug. Get back to the group. This music is not correct.
[4306.20s -> 4308.92s]  You quickly get back to the group where everyone is happily enjoying their treat.
[4316.55s -> 4331.83s]  How about um cough and say you taste metal. Cough. Talk about the metallic like oh like oh I just
[4331.83s -> 4358.66s]  said like rat shit or something. Talk loudly about foul smell of the chocolate bar. Hey guys,
[4358.66s -> 4362.26s]  I think we should talk about the disgusting smell coming from that chocolate bar.
[4362.58s -> 4388.00s]  The crowd, you notice the crowd, you notice the crowd spit out their treat. You notice the crowd
[4388.00s -> 4405.80s]  spitting out their treats. Spitting out their teeth. Don't narrate. The crowd spits out their
[4405.80s -> 4418.29s]  treats. Isn't that, but that's a, I notice the crowd spitting out their treats. Right? Right?
[4418.85s -> 4433.73s]  I notice the crowd spitting out their treats. Oh no, not my chocolate bar. Someone says I'm
[4433.73s -> 4462.72s]  sorry I didn't realize it was that bad. Giggle maniacally. Giggle maniacally. This music's not
[4462.72s -> 4485.38s]  fitting. What are you serious? Someone asks. Spit out the chocolate and scream. Oh my god, what oh
[4485.38s -> 4494.08s]  my god it's so good. I can feel the booze in me. Let me get more of that stuff. Ask security to
[4494.08s -> 4503.38s]  remove the drunk person who somehow got in the tour group or who some, ask security to remove
[4503.38s -> 4532.10s]  the drunk person. Security please, security. I see security take the man out of the tour guide. I
[4532.66s -> 4539.20s]  see security take the man out. I see security, I see security take the man out, but just press
[4539.20s -> 4559.75s]  enter. You shout. I watch security take the man out of, like take the man out. I watch security
[4559.75s -> 4576.00s]  take the man out. He's just a drunk. He can do nothing wrong. What they want to leave him here?
[4576.56s -> 4599.83s]  After security leaves, I watch the man dunk his entire hand in one of the chocolate vats.
[4601.70s -> 4615.48s]  Like you left him here. In one of the, how do you spell vats of chocolate? Vats, vats, vats of
[4615.48s -> 4630.95s]  chocolate, vats of chocolate, like a vat. After security leaves, I watch, I watch the man dunk
[4630.95s -> 4649.84s]  his entire hand in one of the vats of chocolate. Use vats for bonus damage. Yeah, a vat. You could
[4649.84s -> 4659.48s]  have taken him out. You start laughing hysterically. Oh my god, this is so good. I want more. You
[4659.48s -> 4667.72s]  demand more chocolate. I thought I'm not supposed to like this. I'm supposed to tell people not to
[4667.72s -> 4680.82s]  eat this. Jesus Christ. Oh, now we're getting, now we're getting goofy. I pour the entire bottle of
[4680.82s -> 4704.71s]  vodka into the chocolate. You eat the chocolate with your hands. You continue eating till you're
[4704.71s -> 4708.55s]  full. You then proceed to drink the rest of the alcohol in the bottle, which gives you an even
[4708.55s -> 4723.48s]  bigger buzz than before. I puke in the, I puke in the section that says sanitation.
[4724.36s -> 4740.36s]  Please be safe. I puke in the chocolate container. I puke in the largest chocolate
[4741.38s -> 4755.36s]  container. You get up and stagger around the room. You finally collapse on the floor. The next day
[4755.36s -> 4760.24s]  you wake up from a nap feeling like a zombie. You wake up to the sound of loud music playing in your
[4760.24s -> 4778.60s]  ear. I can't fucking handle this music anymore. It's my cell phone. It's your funeral. I reach
[4779.72s -> 4786.74s]  over it and answer the phone. It's just, it's my ringtone. I'm lying on the ground.
[4787.78s -> 4796.90s]  You hear a voice on either end. Hello? You say, who, who are you? What do you want? Person on
[4796.90s -> 4800.50s]  the other end says, I'm not sure yet, but I'll tell you something. Everything's soon and hangs up.
[4811.81s -> 4831.14s]  Immediately call that number back. I immediately call that number back. You hear a male voice on
[4831.14s -> 4836.50s]  the other end. Hello? You say, what did you do to me? Person on the other end says nothing. I just
[4836.50s -> 4853.72s]  wanted to make sure you were still alive and hangs up again. It's checking in on me. Get up and get
[4853.72s -> 4865.65s]  up. Look into the mirror. No, no mirrors in this one. You go to the door and look outside. It's
[4865.65s -> 4870.77s]  almost completely dark now. You slowly walk towards the window. Suddenly you feel something
[4870.77s -> 4875.89s]  grab your arm from behind and pull you inside. A shadow covers your face as you're pulled inside
[4875.89s -> 4894.42s]  by someone else. Look around the room. You can't escape the mirror. Oh no, it's Twix assassins.
[4894.98s -> 4899.54s]  There's a table covered with food and drinks. On top of it sits a man dressed in black
[4899.54s -> 4905.56s]  clothing, holding a knife. He looks at you and smiles. You scream as loud as you can,
[4905.56s -> 4915.73s]  causing everyone to turn their heads to see what's going on. I tell without, I tell the secret
[4915.73s -> 4931.09s]  recipe. I yell out loud the secret recipe. I'm not fucking dying for this. I yell out loud the secret
[4931.09s -> 4944.82s]  recipe. No, don't. I have to. You quickly repeat it for everyone. Everyone starts laughing and
[4944.82s -> 4949.70s]  clapping along with you. You begin dancing wildly in the middle of the room while singing the song
[4949.78s -> 4963.54s]  to yourself. Finally you fall asleep on top of all these delicious foods. It was a musical.
[4969.24s -> 4989.48s]  Ask the crowd to repeat what I just said. They all laugh and sing along with you. You find out later
[4989.48s -> 5006.23s]  that the recipe was the dark one's secret recipe. You awaken from your sleep in a cold sweat. What
[5006.23s -> 5015.00s]  is the dark one's secret recipe? What is the dark one's secret recipe?
[5015.00s -> 5027.76s]  Should I put this in quotes? Like I'm asking this, right? What is the dark one's secret recipe?
[5028.72s -> 5053.91s]  Someone tells you that they don't know. You decide to go to the dark one's house.
[5054.63s -> 5058.87s]  You walk through the forest and arrive at his home. You enter his house and find him sitting
[5058.87s -> 5076.50s]  on a chair in front of a large fireplace. I ask, what is the secret recipe? Let's get it.
[5076.50s -> 5085.88s]  The dark one doesn't seem to be paying attention to you or anything else.
[5087.08s -> 5092.20s]  You continue asking questions until he finally answers them all. You realize that the dark one
[5092.20s -> 5097.08s]  is a vampire and that he's been feeding off humans ever since he came into this world.
[5097.08s -> 5128.82s]  There's blood in the twigs. Wink. All right, fine. Try, I try a bite of the blood chocolate.
[5129.86s -> 5146.02s]  You feel like you could die right there, but you manage to survive. You tell everyone about
[5146.02s -> 5170.32s]  how the dark one fed off you and how he got here. I make the dark one CEO of the company.
[5171.28s -> 5175.68s]  That's what happens when a vampire bites you. You become like their vampire.
[5175.68s -> 5187.99s]  They own you or something, right? You make sure that everything goes well and then you leave.
[5187.99s -> 5192.53s]  You find out later that the dark one died shortly after you left. Oh my god, why does
[5192.53s -> 5208.16s]  everyone have to die? You woke up in cold sweat. Sudden death syndrome. I know, what the fuck?
[5208.88s -> 5230.08s]  I head to my brother's factory. Gotta check them out both. You go to the factory and see
[5230.08s -> 5235.44s]  that it's not really run by anyone. You notice that there are no machines in sight. You wonder
[5235.44s -> 5240.16s]  if this means the dark one isn't human after all. You start to think about how you should deal with
[5240.16s -> 5260.12s]  this situation. Wait, so the dark one has been... brother is the dark one. Check, hunt down the
[5260.12s -> 5279.43s]  dark one. No, check, check the room. Check the fireplace. That's where he was sitting. Check the
[5279.43s -> 5289.80s]  fireplace. That's where this motherfucker was sitting, remember? Sitting right in front of the
[5289.80s -> 5297.68s]  fireplace. You hear something coming from inside. You open the door and see a giant shadow monster
[5297.68s -> 5302.96s]  standing before you. It suddenly grabs you and throws you against the wall. It begins to drain
[5302.96s -> 5329.35s]  your life force. It's too bad I'm a vampire. Too bad. You notice, I notice I have no life force.
[5330.31s -> 5346.80s]  So the monster cannot take it. Oh fucking god damn it, I didn't press the end.
[5347.92s -> 5354.29s]  You scream for help. A man comes running towards you who looks very scared and runs away as fast
[5354.29s -> 5372.98s]  as he can. You slowly get up and look around you. Revert, revert. I have no life force. It does not
[5374.18s -> 5379.62s]  affect me. Affect me, affect me. Affect, affect, affect. Does not affect me. E,
[5379.70s -> 5385.67s]  effect. Does not affect me. Does not affect me. No, affect is, no, it does not affect me.
[5386.47s -> 5397.24s]  I have no life force. It does not affect me. You scream for help. You're attacked by many other
[5397.24s -> 5401.48s]  monsters. Your screams attract more monsters who come to kill you. All of them attack you,
[5401.48s -> 5421.48s]  but they do nothing to save you. I tell the monsters they could unionize and not need to
[5422.44s -> 5430.61s]  answer to the big, this big one. They do not need to answer to the big boss, the big monster.
[5430.61s -> 5453.38s]  You decide to take some time to rest. You fall asleep again. I think I fucked it up.
[5457.30s -> 5487.70s]  End of text. I'm sorry. I can't let you live. No, no. Tell the monsters to unionize. You decide
[5487.70s -> 5491.22s]  to take control of the factories. You start to work hard and make lots of money. You become very
[5491.22s -> 5499.40s]  rich. You begin to live happily ever after. So the monsters are all now working in the factory.
[5503.76s -> 5523.01s]  Sell the company. You get drunk and watch TV. Suddenly you wake up. I'm sorry. I can't let you
[5523.01s -> 5533.88s]  in. You're joking, right? How would I know what the secret recipe is? Eat all the food. Eat all the
[5533.88s -> 5545.97s]  food in the fridge. That has made myself hungry. You don't get hungry anymore. You go back to your
[5545.97s -> 5549.01s]  room and sleep. You stay at home for a long time thinking about how you could have done things
[5549.01s -> 5569.51s]  differently. You decide to change the way you were living. Fire all the monsters. Give them all a
[5569.51s -> 5580.48s]  million dollars. They celebrate by drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. You tell them that now
[5580.48s -> 5585.52s]  they must all work together or be fired. The monsters agree and immediately form a union called
[5585.52s -> 5601.59s]  the monsters union. This is what I wanted you to do before. See? You got it. All right. Okay.
[5606.45s -> 5616.34s]  Remove the no smoking signs. Apparently. Remove the no smoking signs from the building.
[5617.30s -> 5633.78s]  You tell them that they must all wear uniforms as well. They agree and immediately start wearing
[5633.78s -> 5639.62s]  red shirts and black pants. You decide to give them new names. The workers and the humans.
[5640.34s -> 5648.13s]  You decide to keep the no smoking signs around though. Take down the smokings. The no smoking
[5648.13s -> 5667.78s]  signs. I want... It's turning into a target. You decide to give the workers free health care and
[5667.86s -> 5672.90s]  a pension plan. They agree to immediately start getting tested for cancer, heart disease, diabetes,
[5672.90s -> 5679.60s]  etc. You decide to make sure that they also get paid vacation days on top of their pensions.
[5679.60s -> 5698.34s]  Let them smoke inside. I just want them to be able to smoke in the building. You decide to allow the
[5698.34s -> 5706.10s]  workers to drink alcohol inside too. They agree and start doing it regularly. You decide to add
[5706.10s -> 5719.54s]  a few more benefits like free haircuts, free haircuts, massages, free food, and free internet.
[5719.54s -> 5735.51s]  What is this? Google? The humans are happy with these changes. What do you mean the humans? Fill
[5735.51s -> 5767.68s]  the room with cigarette smoke. You decide to... You decide to put out the fire. You decide to stop
[5767.68s -> 5772.72s]  giving out free health care and pensions. The workers are unhappy with this. You decide to increase
[5772.72s -> 5782.72s]  taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and massage parlors. The workers are angry. So wait a minute. The work...
[5782.72s -> 5796.29s]  The hum... The... Wait. Why is... The workers are angry at this idea. Oh, the AI hates smoking.
[5796.93s -> 5817.44s]  Smoke a cigar in front of everyone. Unless... You decide to give the workers a day off every week so
[5817.44s -> 5822.56s]  they can relax. They agree and start taking vacations every year. You decide to raise the
[5822.56s -> 5843.94s]  retirement age to 70. Collect taxes from the workers. You decide to increase the retirement
[5843.94s -> 5849.94s]  age again. The workers are very upset by this idea. You decide to increase taxes on cigarettes,
[5849.94s -> 5859.06s]  alcohol, and massage parlors yet again. They are really mad at this idea. Ask how much a pack
[5859.06s -> 5879.91s]  of cigarettes is now. Ask how much a pack of cigarettes is. They say $10. You decide to raise
[5879.91s -> 5887.03s]  the tax rate to $20 per pack. They agree and then they demand that you lower it to $15 per pack.
[5887.83s -> 5905.43s]  Hey, how much are cigarettes these days? $10. Oh, now they're $20. Say $15. No, $50 a pack. Raise
[5906.15s -> 5931.41s]  the price of cigarettes to $50 a pack. They refuse to pay any more than that and they will only buy
[5931.41s -> 5937.01s]  from your competitors. You raise the price of liquor to $100 a bottle. They refuse to pay
[5937.01s -> 5941.59s]  anything over that amount either. You've just been given an ultimatum by your employees.
[5959.43s -> 5970.00s]  Give out free hot dogs once a week. Is that all right? We're negotiating here.
[5971.12s -> 5983.36s]  They don't want any more free hot dogs. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to five
[5983.36s -> 5991.08s]  per week. They agree and they insist on having them delivered right now. You decide to give out
[5991.08s -> 5999.19s]  free beer once a month instead. They want to eat hot dogs every day. Agree to eating hot dogs
[5999.91s -> 6021.36s]  every day for lunch. They agree and then they insist on drinking beer all night long. You
[6021.36s -> 6026.00s]  decide to give out free cigars once a month. They agree and then they insist on smoking cigars all
[6026.00s -> 6053.64s]  day. You decide to give out free condoms once a month. They're winning. Oh, add in, no, take,
[6053.64s -> 6060.77s]  take away, take away bathroom breaks. If you're, all right, if you're gonna get, you're gonna get,
[6060.85s -> 6068.39s]  you're gonna be able to drink beer all day. No, take, no, no. Add one extra bathroom break
[6068.95s -> 6092.16s]  a week. No, work seven, tell them they need to work seven days a week. Remove bathrooms. They
[6092.16s -> 6096.08s]  agree and then they insist on working full-time. You decide to give out free birth control pills
[6096.08s -> 6102.80s]  once a month. They agree and they insist on using them all the time. The human population has reached
[6102.80s -> 6126.98s]  its peak as you see it, so they didn't, don't want any more people. Show off my 15 children.
[6137.41s -> 6141.17s]  You decide to cut back on the amount of hot dogs you give out. The workers are happy with this
[6141.17s -> 6154.80s]  change. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 10. Slam the gavel down and end
[6154.80s -> 6173.60s]  negotiations. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 20. No, they agree and they
[6173.60s -> 6177.36s]  insist on having them delivered every single day. You decide to increase the number of free hot
[6177.36s -> 6201.41s]  dogs to 30. Stop giving out hot dogs. Stop giving out hot dogs. They protest but they accept it.
[6201.41s -> 6206.05s]  You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 40 per week. They agree and they insist
[6206.05s -> 6209.33s]  on having them delivered every single day. You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to
[6209.33s -> 6240.77s]  50 a week. Throw, get rid of all hot dogs. They complain about this decision but they accept it.
[6240.77s -> 6245.62s]  You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to 60 per week. They agree and they insist
[6245.62s -> 6261.27s]  on having them delivered every day. Eat all of the hot dogs. Eat all of the hot dogs. This is
[6261.27s -> 6270.84s]  inflation. They protest about this too but they accept it. You decide to increase the number of
[6270.84s -> 6277.64s]  free hot dogs to 80 per week. They agree and they insist on having them delivered every day. You eat
[6277.64s -> 6306.16s]  all of the hot dogs. Notice the burglar who all 80. Notice the, notice the burger.
[6317.19s -> 6332.00s]  Notice the, no, no mirrors, no mirrors. Say it's time for our company-wide yoga class.
[6332.00s -> 6341.88s]  Like let's get fucking out of here. You have successfully managed to make everyone miserable.
[6342.76s -> 6382.26s]  Enjoy yoga. Your company is now happy again. We did it. Say, when is this happening in my brother's
[6382.26s -> 6399.91s]  factory? Okay goodbye. Going back to my factory. Head back to my factory. You arrive at your factory
[6399.91s -> 6403.11s]  and find that there are no more people around you. It seems like a normal day in your life.
[6406.48s -> 6417.60s]  Turn on the chocolate machines. Well of course there's no people around me. Those are workers
[6417.60s -> 6423.96s]  at my brother's. The room is dark except for a small light above the door which illuminates
[6423.96s -> 6430.04s]  the room. A large chocolatier stands behind it holding a tray of full of shiny black and white
[6430.04s -> 6441.20s]  bars of chocolate. He looks up as you enter and smiles at you. Hello. Tell the chocolatier
[6441.92s -> 6470.37s]  to add hot dogs to the chocolate. It made up a word? He nods his head slowly. Yes yes I know
[6470.37s -> 6475.41s]  what you mean. He begins pouring some into a large bowl and places it on top of the tray of
[6475.41s -> 6493.12s]  chocolate bars. Ask him to mix them together. Oh yes please do, the chocolatier says. You look
[6493.12s -> 6497.68s]  at the tray of chocolate bars and see that there are two types of chocolate. One has a lot of milk
[6497.68s -> 6513.25s]  in it and one type has very little milk in it. Pour the hot dog mixture into the tray.
[6514.21s -> 6527.40s]  The chocolatier quickly mixes the hot dog mixture with the chocolate. As he does so,
[6527.40s -> 6531.40s]  he puts down a spoonful of chocolate onto the tray. He then starts adding more chocolate to
[6531.40s -> 6551.65s]  the tray until it's completely covered by hot dog mixture. Ask him how it tastes. It's delicious,
[6551.65s -> 6556.53s]  he exclaims happily. You nod your head and continue eating the hot dogs. After you're
[6556.53s -> 6560.85s]  finishing off your meal, you sit down in a chair next to the chocolatier who gives you an odd look.
[6566.60s -> 6586.28s]  Sell them for $20 each. You look at the chocolatier and smile. I'll be in my office for a moment.
[6586.92s -> 6591.24s]  You walk out of the room and open up your office door. Inside you find yourself staring at a
[6591.24s -> 6608.95s]  mannequin wearing nothing but a pair of tight white panties. I'll be in my office for a little
[6608.95s -> 6630.74s]  bit. It's been a long day. I'm going to go like, oh my god, tight white, like tidy whiteys. What?
[6638.37s -> 6663.54s]  Sit in my chair. Oh, the AI is overloaded. Can't do that task. As you stare at the mannequin,
[6663.54s -> 6667.22s]  you feel a strange feeling. You don't understand why, but something about this makes you uncomfortable
[6667.22s -> 6675.00s]  and suddenly your eyes close and you fall asleep. Wake up and leave my office. I'm not even giving
[6675.00s -> 6694.05s]  it a fucking chance. You wake up and notice that you're still sitting in your chair.
[6694.85s -> 6698.05s]  You try to stand up, but you can't move any further than where you were before.
[6698.61s -> 6702.93s]  Your body feels numb and cold. Suddenly the sensation goes away and all that remains is
[6702.93s -> 6711.36s]  a dull ache throughout your entire body. Look for the mannequin. How do you spell mannequin?
[6720.56s -> 6731.68s]  I got sick from the chocolate? You search the room for the mannequin but find nothing.
[6732.24s -> 6735.36s]  You look around the house again and realize that you aren't even sure if you're home anymore.
[6735.76s -> 6739.04s]  This place is just too weird and unsettling for you to ever want to return here.
[6740.16s -> 6771.09s]  Open the desk drawer and eat a calming hot dog. You open the desk drawer and take out a small
[6771.09s -> 6775.56s]  brown paper bag from which you pull out a hot dog wrapped in foil. You bite into the hot dog
[6775.56s -> 6790.26s]  as it sizzles on your tongue and savor its salty taste. Chop up hot dog and roll it in tobacco
[6790.26s -> 6807.54s]  paper. You roll up the hot dog and wrap it in tobacco paper. You then stuff the rolled
[6807.54s -> 6817.94s]  up hot dog into a large plastic bag. You put the bag inside a larger bag and shove everything
[6817.94s -> 6836.36s]  else back into your drawer. That's my secret hot dog joint. Smoke the hot dog joint. Smoke the desk.
[6851.88s -> 6856.44s]  You light up the cigarette and inhale deeply through your nose. The smoke fills your lungs
[6856.44s -> 6861.56s]  and makes you cough violently. You exhale slowly, taking care not to let the smoke escape out of
[6861.56s -> 6884.08s]  your mouth or nostrils. Open up drawer and inhale deeply. Like, I'm getting the hot dog scent.
[6884.08s -> 6890.39s]  You open up the drawer and take out a pack of cigarettes. You light one up and begin to smoke
[6890.39s -> 6893.59s]  it. It takes some effort but eventually you manage to get a good grip on the cigarette between your
[6893.59s -> 6910.26s]  teeth. It's time for dinner? What? Oh shit, it kind of is. Oh yeah, they do have dinner. Yeah,
[6911.22s -> 6915.92s]  all right, let's end this. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[6916.88s -> 6929.35s]  You open the drawer and take a pack of cigarettes. Use the hot dog as goggles. I don't know, what the
[6929.35s -> 6938.36s]  fuck am I supposed to do now? I'm like, no, I'm just like obsessed with them. You hold the cigar
[6938.36s -> 6942.84s]  in your hand and blow on it, letting the smoke escape out of your mouth. You then use the cigar
[6942.84s -> 6948.45s]  as a makeshift straw to suck on the smoke coming off of it. As you do so, you see an image appear
[6948.45s -> 6982.16s]  in front. Okay, so what is the image in front of me? The image appears to be a young girl's face
[6982.16s -> 6986.56s]  looking down at you with tearful eyes. She has long black hair and her skin is pale white. Her eyes
[6986.56s -> 7002.08s]  are blue and she looks very sad. Kim looking for a reservation. Say I'm sorry for being late
[7003.20s -> 7012.90s]  to the dinner reservation. Say sorry for being late to the dinner reservation.
[7026.45s -> 7030.13s]  Quickly turn around and apologize to the woman who is now staring at you with tears streaming
[7030.13s -> 7034.13s]  down her cheeks. She doesn't seem to have noticed you yet but she does when you finish apologizing.
[7036.37s -> 7055.08s]  Leave and go to dinner with girlfriend. You run outside and rush over to the car where you grab
[7055.08s -> 7059.64s]  your keys and purse. You unlock the door and exit the house. You head towards your girlfriend's car
[7059.64s -> 7077.38s]  but suddenly you hear a loud noise behind you. What? You're on a lookout. Look behind me. What?
[7077.38s -> 7089.72s]  What is it? You turn around and see a huge explosion that seems to come from all directions.
[7089.72s -> 7100.20s]  What? It seems to come from all directions. All directions? What do you mean all directions?
[7100.20s -> 7103.24s]  Your body feels like it's going numb. What the fuck?
[7114.52s -> 7134.36s]  You fall backwards onto the ground still clutching your chest. What happened? What was that? What was
[7134.44s -> 7151.00s]  it? What? Look around. You look around and see that the entire street is in flames. What the fuck?
[7155.94s -> 7174.72s]  What the fuck? Go to dinner? I'm trying. There are no longer any buildings left. Why was there like a
[7180.87s -> 7195.36s]  wake up from my dream? You awaken from your nightmare and realize that you're back home.
[7195.36s -> 7199.36s]  You walk in the kitchen to find that everything's intact except for the refrigerator which is broken
[7199.36s -> 7214.21s]  and smoking. Inspect the fridge. You examine the fridge and find that it contains several bottles
[7214.21s -> 7235.04s]  of beer. You pick up one bottle and sniff it. Why is the fridge smoking? Why is the fridge
[7236.00s -> 7259.32s]  smoking? You ask your question aloud and the woman answers. What did she say? No, I got time. I got
[7259.32s -> 7285.35s]  time. Smoking with the fridge. What do you mean? Smoking with the fridge means that you put your
[7285.35s -> 7289.86s]  mouth close to the side of the fridge and blow out some of its contents. This will make it easier
[7289.86s -> 7299.11s]  for you to drink your beer without getting burned. I do that. I know I'm not supposed to do that.
[7299.11s -> 7306.00s]  You do exactly that and then take another sip of your beer. The smell is very strong but you
[7306.00s -> 7310.48s]  manage to ignore it as you continue drinking. After about half an hour you feel sick so you
[7310.48s -> 7330.56s]  vomit into a trash bag and throw it away. I can't. It won't let me leave. You smoke the trash bag and
[7330.56s -> 7344.95s]  then throw it away too. You've had enough of alcohol for today. I'm trying. I'm trying to get
[7344.95s -> 7354.37s]  to the end. You run full speed into the wall and fall over. You roll onto your stomach and crawl
[7354.37s -> 7358.13s]  towards the door but you can't get through it since all the glass has been shattered.
[7359.43s -> 7375.73s]  No, I can't. I can't even die. No, not eat glass. I don't want to eat the glass. Eat the glass.
[7375.73s -> 7389.89s]  Oh no. I don't want to eat glass. I can't do it. Get up and run full speed into the fridge.
[7390.45s -> 7398.34s]  You crawl towards the fridge and try to open it but you don't have much luck. You finally succeed
[7398.34s -> 7402.34s]  in opening it when you hear a loud noise. It's like something exploded inside the fridge.
[7403.14s -> 7420.40s]  Oh my fucking. Look around. You look around and see that the whole room is covered in broken glass.
[7420.40s -> 7424.32s]  There's no way you could have gotten through it. You're going to need more help than just yourself.
[7425.04s -> 7437.73s]  Fine. I'll do it. I got time. I got the reservations. No, I'm good. Don't worry.
[7437.73s -> 7441.57s]  You grab a piece of broken glass from the floor and start eating it. The taste isn't bad at all.
[7441.57s -> 7454.64s]  You finish. Oh, you grab a piece of broken glass from the floor and start eating it.
[7454.64s -> 7459.04s]  The taste isn't bad at all. You finish off most of it before you realize what's happening. You
[7459.04s -> 7479.91s]  begin vomiting blood and falling into conscious again. Ask the wizards for help. As soon as you
[7479.91s -> 7483.11s]  pass out, you suddenly wake up and scream for help. A voice answers back and tells you that
[7483.11s -> 7487.59s]  there are no wizards here. They'll say, they say they'll send someone to check on you later,
[7487.59s -> 7511.46s]  but right now they want to talk to you privately. End the story. Dude, this has been a long,
[7511.46s -> 7526.87s]  we've been going crazy. Uh, Raiden, turn off the game console right now. Raiden, uh, get up and
[7528.15s -> 7540.13s]  get up and make it to dinner on time. There are no explosions. No, get up and make it to dinner on
[7540.13s -> 7552.58s]  time. Get up and make it to dinner on time. You stand up and make it to dinner on time.
[7552.58s -> 7555.78s]  Your stomach rumbles loudly every once in a while, but you still manage to make it.
[7555.78s -> 7559.22s]  When dinner's done, you go back to sleep hoping that this was just a nightmare. No, no, no, no,
[7559.22s -> 7562.34s]  no, no, no. It's not a nightmare. It's a wonderful evening with my girlfriend, our anniversary.
[7564.16s -> 7577.24s]  God damn it. Um, wake up and know it was a good time. It was not a nightmare.
[7578.12s -> 7598.47s]  There. Um, happy anniversary. There. Okay. I had a good time at our anniversary dinner.
[7598.47s -> 7609.88s]  The end. Here we go. You lie down in bed and enjoy your meal after finishing eating your
[7609.88s -> 7613.48s]  refresh. Think about how lucky you were to be able to attend an event like this
[7613.48s -> 7643.03s]  one day after another. And there it is done. All right. I'll see you guys later.
[7643.67s -> 7654.16s]  Oh, I had to play the tune. I don't, I can't. Oh, okay. Remember I told you like three hours
[7654.16s -> 7666.07s]  ago that I was going to sneeze. There it is. It happened. That was a lot of fun. But yeah,
[7666.07s -> 7672.16s]  I, I gotta get going. Kim and I are doing our anniversary dinner tonight and then tomorrow
[7672.16s -> 7677.78s]  we're doing some stuff too. So I will be back. Let's get a good, let's get a schedule here for
[7677.78s -> 7682.18s]  the weekend. Yeah. No, no, no, I got time. Don't worry. I got time. I'm not going to miss this
[7682.18s -> 7688.23s]  shit. Don't worry guys. Trust me. I'm good. Reservations at like six 45. I have like nine
[7688.23s -> 7695.92s]  minutes to get there. It's fine. The joke. I'm kidding. So we got, uh, I'll be back on,
[7695.92s -> 7702.40s]  we'll do Friday, Saturday, Sunday of this weekend and we're going to do some cool stuff. We're
[7702.40s -> 7707.68s]  going to start on Friday. We're going to do black and white too. Uh, Murius is back this weekend
[7710.12s -> 7716.55s]  and maybe that'll take us Friday, Saturday, Sunday. We'll probably start mega man legends
[7717.19s -> 7732.98s]  and going into Monday, maybe we'll see. Hopefully you had fun tonight. We'll see you again. I'm
[7732.98s -> 7743.84s]  literally pogging. Is physical therapy going good? Yeah. I actually have another appointment
[7744.56s -> 7752.34s]  this week in like a day or two, I think. Yeah. But yeah, I gotta get to dinner. Thanks for hanging
[7752.34s -> 7758.34s]  out with me for the last five hours or so. A couple of shorter streams in a row here,
[7759.68s -> 7763.44s]  but I've been kind of all over the place. I told you February is going to be really busy,
[7764.16s -> 7771.76s]  but you do what you got to do, right? I'll see you guys on Friday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[7772.40s -> 7783.03s]  Mark it on your calendars. Have a good one. Let's do the outro. I, I, all jokes aside,
[7783.03s -> 7793.86s]  I really do have plenty of time. Don't worry. Don't worry. All these fucking photo shops.
[7794.82s -> 7800.95s]  All right. So we had, let's get the bits and everything up. Let's get the music too.
[7817.11s -> 7822.55s]  Mega man legends games are on PS3 for $2 on sale. Well, I already, I already owned them for
[7822.55s -> 7835.17s]  PlayStation one. So unfortunately I cannot buy those. All right, here we go. Do they look any
[7835.17s -> 7841.70s]  better? Are they, it's not that they're increased graphics, is it? Or is it just the same thing?
[7842.50s -> 7850.26s]  I don't know. No remaster. Same thing. Okay. Cool. Well, yeah, I got, I got them already,
[7850.26s -> 7856.26s]  but a potion dweller. Thanks for 300 bits as a reminder to chat, save your winks for April 1st
[7856.26s -> 7860.50s]  or the next day after the first, so that he streams, we're going to do a huge wink dump on
[7860.50s -> 7867.56s]  him and make him wink the whole stream. Oh, that's going to be, that's going to be ridiculous. Good
[7867.56s -> 7876.40s]  luck with that. Sly 161. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma, that wink kind of sucked. Can I have my
[7876.40s -> 7881.20s]  money back by reading this? You are contractually obligated to meet my demands by the way. Anyway,
[7881.20s -> 7886.21s]  see you later. Um, I don't, I'm not, I don't have my special signing pen, so that's not accurate.
[7887.01s -> 7892.10s]  I only sign documents with my special signing pen so nobody can forge it. I know exactly what
[7892.10s -> 7900.52s]  the ink looks like. I know the exact color. That's not how it works. Hey, wind sock. Thanks for the
[7900.52s -> 7907.28s]  $15, 1500 bits from wind sock. Thanks a lot, man. Today's my birthday. Just want to say thanks for
[7907.28s -> 7913.20s]  the years of content. I'm still recovering from second degree burns on my hand. So glad you're
[7913.20s -> 7922.48s]  giving me something to do today. That sounds painful. Hopefully you recover well. Follow
[7922.48s -> 7930.20s]  your doctor's instructions. Hopefully you heal up nicely. Thanks a bunch for the $15, 1500 bits.
[7930.20s -> 7938.39s]  Appreciate it. Hey, dark soul. Thanks for the 250. Mega Man Legends one and two are some of
[7938.39s -> 7943.81s]  my favorite games ever. If you stream the zero ZX collection coming out, I'll literally pog my
[7943.81s -> 7951.56s]  pants. I swear to God, we're getting a shitload of community subs right now. Uh, when Hawaiian
[7951.56s -> 7961.43s]  just gave 10 community subs. Thank you, wine. Just back to back there. Thanks for the sub drops.
[7961.43s -> 7968.45s]  I also want to make very clear here. Uh, Twitch staff was in here at link and gave a hundred
[7968.45s -> 7975.81s]  community subs. So that's ridiculous. Thanks for, uh, thanks for playing along link. That was fun.
[7975.81s -> 7983.12s]  Thank you. The huge amount of subs as well. Uh, super Bruce gave six community subs and like I
[7983.12s -> 7991.56s]  said five earlier, so that was wrong, but thank you. Super Bruce basic feral. Thanks for the 1800
[7991.56s -> 8005.11s]  bits, 18 bucks. Leave stream for Kim. Don't worry. We've got a whole day plan too. Appreciate it
[8005.11s -> 8011.94s]  though. Thanks. That's a huge amount of money. That's nearly $20 in bits. Thank you. Ray the
[8011.94s -> 8015.30s]  color. Thanks for the 300 bits. This is the definition of a fuck face stream. If there's
[8015.30s -> 8019.88s]  ever been one, uh, why not make community crack night a thing from now on alongside the community
[8019.88s -> 8029.33s]  content nights? I don't think you can plan a community crack night. I think they just kind
[8029.33s -> 8043.40s]  of happen whenever you guys do crack. No one wants a community crack night. Uh, 4,500 bits
[8043.40s -> 8051.24s]  came in from Goiki. So nearly $50. I didn't touch upon it earlier. That's a lot of fucking money.
[8051.24s -> 8057.51s]  We love you. Ego maniac streamer. Thanks for the huge money drop. Thanks for the $50 4500 bits
[8057.51s -> 8067.35s]  from Goiki. You're still here. Thank you. Kind of early to end. Yes it is, but I have to,
[8067.35s -> 8072.12s]  it's me and my girlfriend's anniversary. So we have dinner reservations. So that's why this stream
[8072.12s -> 8087.01s]  is ending shorter than usual tonight. I'm a crack by a snack is better when it happens organically.
[8087.01s -> 8099.33s]  Yeah, I agree. I don't, you can't like plan on something like that, but thank you. Goiki. Hey,
[8099.33s -> 8103.25s]  gnarly. Thanks for the two 50. It's kind of sad how your ironic joke about winks being too much
[8103.25s -> 8112.63s]  effort for you turned to reality. What are you talking? What do you mean? Derma hates winks.
[8112.63s -> 8132.07s]  This is from Diablo two. Like that's so hard. Oh, God, God damn it. I have to, somebody watched my
[8132.07s -> 8141.88s]  stream for like 60 hours. I have to turn on my camera and go like this. God damn it. It's like
[8141.88s -> 8163.20s]  such a, so hard to do that apparently. Well, I know I've seen the, I've seen the German like
[8163.20s -> 8173.75s]  lights a spoon up and does crack. Anyways. Yeah. What do you want me to say? It's been, it's hard.
[8176.77s -> 8186.08s]  Where's my, what'd I do with my thing? I lost it. How, how did I lose it already?
[8187.30s -> 8195.12s]  No, it's gone. Uh, X out of the window. It's this crack spoon. I know it's not crack,
[8195.68s -> 8201.70s]  but anyways, uh, yeah, the way don't, the winks are not going anywhere. Don't worry.
[8201.70s -> 8208.85s]  I will do them. Hey, autumn dragons. Thanks for the two 50. You should replace the wink with
[8208.85s -> 8214.05s]  turning on a face cam, but also add another 75,000 reward to turn off the face cam.
[8214.69s -> 8221.20s]  No one's going to turn it off. People will turn it on. No one's going to spend 75,000 to turn it
[8221.20s -> 8242.10s]  off. No, I should have it be 75,000 to turn it on and two to turn it off. Thanks though.
[8242.10s -> 8245.94s]  Earl of illusion. Thanks for the two 50. Here's some more bits towards taking Kim to see Sonic
[8245.94s -> 8252.23s]  on Valentine's day. I swear to God, you're actually going to like it. I mean, Jim carries in it. I
[8252.23s -> 8273.06s]  probably love it. And bumpy here. Sorry about that. What's this? Get rid of this. How do I
[8273.06s -> 8281.73s]  get rid of this? Wait, what? I don't want to play Metro Exodus. What the fuck is going on?
[8285.78s -> 8291.92s]  Why can I not delete this? Hey, you person that just landed on the channel page. Okay,
[8291.92s -> 8302.31s]  that was fucking weird. Um, oh shit. I just deleted the credits. I just deleted the credits. Come on
[8305.99s -> 8310.07s]  that I replied. That was where the credits were. That's why I was confused.
[8310.07s -> 8318.10s]  Too many tabs. Hold on. Those are the stream labs credits. Everyone. Hold on. Wait, wait,
[8318.10s -> 8327.32s]  I hold away. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta get, I gotta fix this. Wait, how do I, I can,
[8327.32s -> 8336.48s]  can I control? Okay, wait. No, no, no, I don't. I can undo. Hey, you person that just landed on
[8336.48s -> 8352.40s]  the channel page. Turn it off. Okay. I can fix it. All right. Give me a second. Oh, he's got good
[8352.40s -> 8367.28s]  dental. Dental implants. Hold on. Why does this keep happening to me? How do you hate your past?
[8368.32s -> 8380.87s]  I don't. I would delete all this stuff if I didn't like it. What did I search? What are you talking
[8381.35s -> 8386.63s]  about? You just scammed a wink. No, no, no, no. I didn't. I didn't. I promise.
[8387.35s -> 8394.45s]  I just have, my credits got fucking deleted. Hold on. There we go. All right. Here we go. Here
[8394.45s -> 8408.53s]  come the credits. No, nobody got scammed. Roll them. There they are. Thanks a lot. Everybody for the
[8408.53s -> 8423.01s]  subs. Don't worry. You get your wink. Here it comes. You will get your wink right here. Check
[8423.01s -> 8432.39s]  it out. And that was, that was a full cam wearing fucking star. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I'm wearing a star
[8432.39s -> 8447.36s]  war shirt. Whatever. Who cares? You know, I'm, I'm not wearing this to dinner. I'm going to change.
[8448.00s -> 8460.34s]  You think I'm going to go to my girlfriend during dinner anniversary in a star war shirt?
[8460.34s -> 8467.84s]  No, I'm not completely out of my mind. It's just, that's easy. All right. I don't need to
[8467.84s -> 8474.56s]  explain myself. Okay. Let's go. But thank you, link. Thank you. All the subs. There's a ton of
[8474.56s -> 8482.71s]  them were community subs from today. A hundred from link. Thank you. Earl of illusions for that
[8482.71s -> 8487.67s]  felt Sonic the hedgehog. Appreciate it. Of course I'm going to like that movie. Red Walrus. Thanks
[8487.67s -> 8492.95s]  for the 300 bits. What's your favorite Warhammer faction? It's the Tao 40 K or fantasy 40 K.
[8493.75s -> 8496.95s]  You can't pick the Skaven. That's cheating. Everyone likes the rats. It's the Tao.
[8497.83s -> 8504.74s]  I like the Tao. I think they have like an interesting, uh, units. You're going to be
[8504.74s -> 8514.76s]  late to your reservation. No. Uh, what is it? X, X V 22 battle suit, X V 22 battle suit ready.
[8514.76s -> 8526.71s]  I like the hero and he's cool. Yeah, that's the one. Thank you. Red Walrus, the three bits, 300
[8526.71s -> 8532.60s]  bits. Hey, your boy. Thanks for the 10 community subs. I missed it, but thanks for 10 subs given
[8532.60s -> 8542.45s]  to the community. Shazzo ready to take command. That's right. Mr. Chachimur. Mr. Chachimur.
[8542.45s -> 8549.72s]  Thanks for the 300 bits. They just say hi, Jerma. Hi. Lizard Amiibo 300 bits. Thanks for really
[8549.72s -> 8554.76s]  great stream tonight. It's been one of my favorites. That's good to know. Thank you. Also, thanks for
[8554.76s -> 8559.65s]  helping me escape my bathroom. You're welcome. Secret technique. If you ever get yourself in a
[8559.65s -> 8566.12s]  situation like that, careful. The point. Thanks for 300 bits. The point. Jerma, this is such a
[8566.12s -> 8571.09s]  good stream. I hope you have a good anniversary with Kim. Uh, this is so funny and amazing. Holy
[8571.09s -> 8589.70s]  shit. Laughing my ass off. Thank you. LOL. LOL. Dark soul. Thanks for the 250. Haha. Guess that
[8589.70s -> 8598.39s]  didn't happen. Hey, will you marry me? Enraged grandpa. Thanks for the 500 bits. Pull out the
[8598.39s -> 8616.00s]  fight stick. Me? You're talking about me? No, I can't. No. Hey, disinterest. Thanks for the 250.
[8616.00s -> 8623.64s]  Hey, Jerma, I once saw a clip of you showing how loud you can make your voice. I was wondering if
[8623.64s -> 8628.84s]  you've ever used that skill to shatter wine glasses. And that's why you drink wine out of sippy cups.
[8628.84s -> 8638.52s]  Cheers. No, just hurt people's ears around me and annoy them. Pretty much it. Hey,
[8638.52s -> 8645.52s]  Ferodian weapon. Thanks for the 500 bits, Ferodian. Five bucks. Hope you and Kim have a happy
[8645.52s -> 8649.92s]  anniversary. Also hope the physical therapy is going well. Love the streams as always, even if
[8649.92s -> 8654.56s]  I'm not really as active in the community I used to be. As I used to be. These streams always put
[8654.56s -> 8662.55s]  a smile on my face. I'll get the hell out of here and go seek him. Oh, I am. Yeah, the PT is going
[8662.55s -> 8667.27s]  well. I only had one appointment, so I'm gonna wait and see how it goes over the next three,
[8667.27s -> 8679.16s]  four weeks. See what happens after that. Thanks a lot, Ferodian. Worm club. Thanks for the 500
[8679.16s -> 8683.86s]  bits, worm club. Jerma, I've been watching your streams and VODs for only a few months,
[8684.58s -> 8689.38s]  but I've already joined the had a dream about Jerma club. I dreamt that you got your start
[8689.38s -> 8696.82s]  making webcam videos of yourself smoking massive amounts of keif and reviewing it set to cheesy
[8696.82s -> 8703.04s]  psychedelic music. Anyway, love you, man. Hope your PT fixes you up and you don't have to smoke keif
[8703.04s -> 8710.80s]  for pain. Happy anniversary to you and Kim. Thanks a lot, worm club. A marijuana review stream.
[8715.19s -> 8719.03s]  I almost, it would take a little, some effort, but it would be kind of funny.
[8719.59s -> 8723.19s]  This is by the way, add this to the list of things that I'm going to say that I'm never going to do,
[8723.19s -> 8728.36s]  but it'd be funny. Is to get a bunch of dreams that people have had about me and just reenact
[8728.36s -> 8733.64s]  them and just have like a watch all these streams. Like just do a watch party. It's like three hours
[8733.64s -> 8745.83s]  of just fucked up dreams people have had. It would take a lot of effort. It would be kind
[8745.83s -> 8751.49s]  of funny though. Hey Tingy, thanks for the 250. Remember how you once talked about how you don't
[8751.49s -> 8755.81s]  read resubs and vids during gameplay portions of the stream because they get in the way and derail
[8755.81s -> 8764.34s]  the stream? Well, the winks are essentially that, but with fake currency to do it. True, but also,
[8764.34s -> 8773.67s]  but also true. The winks take one second. Reading a sub message and responding to a sub of the
[8773.67s -> 8781.62s]  message takes, as you see here, a good, sometimes I spend one, two, five minutes on a message.
[8782.10s -> 8787.44s]  It usually takes about a minute or two. I turn the webcam on and I go,
[8787.44s -> 8798.29s]  bang, the webcam goes off in about four seconds. Sometimes you get distracted by your own face.
[8798.29s -> 8805.75s]  Don't worry, the winks are going to last as long as they need to. What do you think
[8805.75s -> 8814.21s]  German smells like? Oud. Mystery salt. That's true. Thank you, Tingy, though. Appreciate it.
[8816.31s -> 8820.15s]  Supra 10 touring and thanks for the 300 bits. German funny question is, your hat in the channel
[8820.15s -> 8825.43s]  trailer from a certain city starting with a P in Massachusetts. Don't answer if you aren't comfortable.
[8827.92s -> 8842.44s]  Um, let me see. I don't think so. I think that's like a Longhorns hat. Hold on. Let me see.
[8843.24s -> 8865.44s]  Yeah, that's a Longhorns hat. Sorry. That is a Texas Longhorns hat. Why did I have a Texas
[8865.44s -> 8872.72s]  Longhorns hat? I don't, I cannot tell you the reason why. I think, I think it was my brother's
[8872.72s -> 8885.36s]  hat. I can't believe he likes the towel. Why? Hey, and finally we have, well, let me get this back
[8885.36s -> 8891.94s]  to where we need to be because this is the end of the stream. This is the end. Uh, we have five
[8891.94s -> 8897.38s]  dollars from Daddy. Thank you, Daddy, for the 500 bits. You excited for the Gorillaz and Tame
[8897.38s -> 8906.05s]  Impala collab? Congrats on the anniversary, man. Yeah, I mean, any Gorillaz album I'm excited for.
[8907.57s -> 8913.54s]  Although I really, I wish, I know that David Alburn does this thing sometimes and all of his,
[8913.54s -> 8918.18s]  I love pretty much anything he does and anything, anybody he collabs with and all the music that
[8918.18s -> 8926.02s]  they make. But so like Humans came out, right? And then it was the now now, like not even a year
[8926.02s -> 8930.26s]  later. And I think, doesn't he do this sometimes where he just kind of, let's get it out, get it
[8930.26s -> 8937.12s]  out. Let's get like 20 more tracks out. And they were like recorded on the road. Uh, he did that
[8937.12s -> 8946.07s]  with another album before too. But what was the one, the Fall where he did it like on the road?
[8948.34s -> 8954.02s]  So is this, is this gonna, it's not, this is not an album from my understanding. This is sort of
[8954.02s -> 8959.62s]  this kind of new series they're going to be doing. It's not an album. It's just like a series of
[8960.26s -> 8971.36s]  music or in videos and stuff. It's not an album, right? Anybody correct me here? Yeah, I think so.
[8972.08s -> 8978.76s]  Kind of. It'll eventually be an album, but for now it's just a series. Okay.
[8979.56s -> 8988.71s]  No, that's cool. That's pretty cool. You have five minutes for your reservation. No. Daddy again,
[8988.71s -> 8991.67s]  thanks for the 500 bits. So yeah, I asked if your favorite band, who your band was.
[8992.31s -> 8996.71s]  I said that wrong. I asked who your favorite band was on the comb stream and checked them out
[8996.71s -> 9000.07s]  and heard about it the other day. I think it's a single or series. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
[9000.63s -> 9005.97s]  I'm glad you checked them out. They're a great band. And my favorite songs are Gorilla songs.
[9008.24s -> 9013.64s]  Please notice me, Jeremiah. I'm too poor for your rich minimum requirement price. Hey,
[9013.64s -> 9025.51s]  Gondolaine, how the fuck are you? Done. Noticed. Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to whatever they
[9025.51s -> 9032.90s]  come up with. And I'm going to go seek him. I will see you guys on Friday. Black and White 2.
[9034.16s -> 9040.71s]  Murius will probably return if we can get a cow. See you guys on Friday. We'll do all weekend.
[9042.52s -> 9050.48s]  Good night. Goodbye. And who is streaming right now? What do we have? Who's live?
[9050.48s -> 9060.93s]  Anybody live right now that we can go scream at? Go say hi to Joel.
[9061.65s -> 9067.99s]  He's playing Quake 2. Cooking Simulator. Wait, is he playing Cooking Simulator right now?
[9073.28s -> 9081.32s]  Is he Cooking Simulator? Because that's fun. Oh, he's doing Quake. Okay.
[9082.76s -> 9090.04s]  All right. Yeah, go say hi to Joel. Tell Joel I said.
[9090.84s -> 9109.16s]  Show Joel the mirror. All right. I'll see you guys on Friday. Take care. Good night. Bye. Much love.
