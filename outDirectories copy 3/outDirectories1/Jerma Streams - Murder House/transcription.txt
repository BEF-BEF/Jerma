[6.07s -> 8.95s]  I'm just trying to be very quiet so I don't scare anybody. Hi.
[10.98s -> 36.54s]  Oh, hold on. Very cool. That nice relaxing music is about to be replaced with some scary shit.
[36.54s -> 40.86s]  So this is a game that I'm actually scared to play because I feel like it's going to be
[40.86s -> 53.99s]  insanely loud. So let me ask you this. I have to ask you. Should I turn this down to 1%?
[66.33s -> 82.18s]  No. So is this one, is this going to like blow up my ears? No. I'm so scared. You have no idea.
[82.18s -> 90.81s]  This game is way too dank. Whatever. Okay, let's do this. I'll do it right here for now.
[90.81s -> 103.37s]  It's a puppet combo. Turn it all the way down. Turn the filter off. 20, door turns brightness.
[108.63s -> 129.75s]  What the fuck? Which one should I put on? 16 millimeter is cool. That is kind of cool.
[129.75s -> 146.97s]  16 millimeter, PSX, CRT. None, none, none. Scan lines one. Just normal, please. This hurts my eyes.
[146.97s -> 162.84s]  Let me do PSX and turn this off. Let me see how that looks. New game. Let's try that. Prologue
[162.84s -> 169.40s]  Murder House. I mean, I feel like we're going to have to play the prologue. That looks fine.
[169.40s -> 174.76s]  That's not my mic. Don't people are going to be complaining about that. That's not me.
[174.76s -> 209.72s]  Get my green tea. Okay, kid. You're next. How do I move? Come on, kid. Get your ass up there.
[209.72s -> 240.62s]  That's not my mic. Oh, kid. Say cheese. Cheese. Easter. Turn the volume down. Yeah, the volume's
[240.62s -> 259.77s]  way down. I must have fallen asleep. Just turn it down. How do I move? Oh, I thought it was first
[259.77s -> 268.30s]  person. Okay, that's weird. All right, hold on. Why is there no sound? I'm so paranoid about the
[268.30s -> 283.64s]  audio. I don't think this is supposed to be audio right now. Mom, is the mall closed? No, I can hear
[283.64s -> 296.76s]  it. Just low. It's going to be loud. Yeah, I know. Just be, just be ready for it. It's going to be
[296.76s -> 305.90s]  horrible. It's going to be terrible. Just be ready for it. Oh, you can do Dolly in FPS. Which one should
[306.54s -> 326.49s]  you prefer? FPS or the kind of old Resident Evil style? FPS. FPS. FPS. Oh, man. That sensitivity's
[326.49s -> 341.74s]  got to go up, though. Way higher. Rumble off. Invert Y off. What are you talking about? Auto-aim off.
[341.74s -> 355.75s]  Okay, let's see. That feels better. Dolly, please. Change the game and the title. Oh, shit. Good idea.
[355.75s -> 364.54s]  Oh, it is Murder House. It's correct. Zoomers are picking FPS. I'll switch between them. How
[364.54s -> 378.70s]  does that sound? It's meant to be played in Dolly. Okay, well, I'll go back. I'll play some with Dolly
[378.70s -> 391.66s]  and one without. What am I supposed to do? It's closed. Do a poll? You know, that's not a bad idea.
[391.66s -> 422.76s]  All right. Mods run a poll. Do you want FPS or Dolly? Which one? It's closed. What do you think? Okay.
[422.76s -> 431.19s]  So I'm supposed to just leave the mall? How do I get out of here? It's a landslide for,
[431.19s -> 447.30s]  for what? I can't get out this way. Okay. You know what's crazy? 77% say Dolly. What the fuck?
[447.30s -> 462.06s]  Zoomers BTFO. Is it really that much? Dolly's what? I mean, that's, that's unanimous. I can't,
[462.06s -> 470.78s]  I have to go back. 77%. All right, let's go back. I think I want to use the controller because this
[470.78s -> 482.30s]  is weird to do with keyboard and mouse. The tank controls don't work. I can crawl under it. How do
[482.30s -> 507.56s]  you crawl? C, control. I need the control plugged in for this shit. This is, I can't do it. Oh,
[507.56s -> 513.16s]  that's much better. Okay. That's a little too sensitive though. That's far too sensitive.
[513.16s -> 529.22s]  Looks good. Don't quit. There we go. All right. Now I'm happy. Enable rumble on the controller.
[529.22s -> 534.28s]  I don't do that. I think rumble is the dumbest thing that's ever been invented. I truly believe
[534.28s -> 542.66s]  it. I think rumble is just dumb. I just really do. I'm sorry. I just, I, it just like shakes
[542.66s -> 548.55s]  your hands. See back like 20 years ago, they created rumble because they wanted it to be
[548.55s -> 553.43s]  more immersive. Like, and as you can see, when you jump over the ledge and there's like somebody
[553.43s -> 559.74s]  shooting, it's, oh, I can feel it. That it's like 20 years ago, right? It was, that was cool. But
[559.74s -> 571.11s]  like, I don't, I don't need that anymore. I'm sorry. I just don't need it to me. Now it's just like,
[572.55s -> 576.31s]  I don't. Okay. Stop, stop, stop. Every time you get hit,
[579.83s -> 583.10s]  no, I don't, I just want to play the game. I'm sorry. This might be weird. I'm a complainer.
[583.10s -> 599.66s]  That's fine. The Easter bunny's chair. I guess he went home for the night. I don't know if you guys
[599.66s -> 619.64s]  can hear this, but it's making scary sounds. I fucking hate tank controls more than anything.
[619.64s -> 626.79s]  Tank controls are just the cinematic mode in every car game. I feel like I'm playing GTA.
[626.79s -> 649.35s]  It's just on foot cinematic mode. I can't leave now. Where am I supposed to go? It's closed.
[649.35s -> 694.65s]  Omega Lo, no audio. It's there. It's there. Fix your stream. What are you talking about?
[694.65s -> 702.04s]  Audio is actually kind of low. Turn it up. It's puppet combo, man. I feel like you're going to
[702.04s -> 721.98s]  regret this very shortly. Warning, actual warning, loud audio warning for real. Where the fuck am I
[721.98s -> 753.69s]  supposed to be going? What is happening? I can't get out this way. Where do I go? This is the
[753.69s -> 773.59s]  beginning of the game. Fuck. I went all the way to the back. This kid's going to be out of breath,
[773.59s -> 784.06s]  but I get lost in malls. It doesn't matter how many times I've been to a mall. I could go to the same
[784.06s -> 791.51s]  mall a thousand times. And if you say, Hey dude, can you tell me where the, you know, can you tell
[791.51s -> 799.58s]  me where the Macy's is? I'd go. I don't fucking have any idea. I could go to the same mall a
[799.58s -> 808.18s]  thousand times. And I still could not tell you because it's just like, it's just lines with
[808.18s -> 815.24s]  stores. And then I have to sit there and go, what? I don't know. I don't remember. It's always so
[815.24s -> 821.06s]  embarrassing because especially if you, let's say for instance, if, Oh, you've got a local mall. Oh,
[821.06s -> 825.38s]  let's go explore the local mall. That sounds like fun. Oh, you know, I'd really love to go.
[825.38s -> 831.93s]  I'd really love to go to Auntie Anne's Pretzels. Yeah, I would too. That sounds like fun. Oh,
[831.93s -> 842.17s]  okay. Let's go. Auntie Anne's Pretzels walking distance. Where is it? It's in here somewhere.
[842.17s -> 888.07s]  Okay. I think it's this store over here. I hate it. Who is he talking to? Where the fuck am I
[888.07s -> 932.02s]  supposed to go? I can't get through here. Another security gate. This one's locked. shiny. Take the
[932.02s -> 938.47s]  key. Yes. You took the key. I can use the inventory by pressing Z key. What is that on the controller?
[938.47s -> 954.34s]  Okay. That looks like Tim Heidecker. Okay. A key. I can't use that key here. Do I have to go all the
[954.34s -> 999.13s]  way back? Get this camera in the right place. Am I going the right way? Am I going the right way?
[999.21s -> 1073.18s]  Oh, I got it. This is going to be some Slenderman bullshit. Resident Sleeper. There's got to be a
[1073.18s -> 1086.39s]  way out. The exit's right there. All right. It's going to be like... Should I lower the volume?
[1086.39s -> 1112.95s]  I'm going to lightly put this in. I warn you. These are lightly in my ears right now. What does
[1112.95s -> 1143.30s]  that say? Locked. Locked. All these are locked. This one's opened. Why is it doing like a... Should
[1143.30s -> 1149.56s]  I hide? Yes. This is a good hiding place. I could peek out with the action button and get a closer
[1149.56s -> 1173.80s]  look with the look button. Okay. So I can hide here. All right. Let me out. There's no shitting
[1173.80s -> 1204.04s]  mechanic. Why would there be a shitting mechanic? Okay. All right. I got to go into the bathroom.
[1204.04s -> 1236.26s]  Where's that bathroom? Where's the bathroom? Farting and screaming. Quick, quick. Hide, hide, hide.
[1236.26s -> 1246.46s]  He locked the door? What do you mean he locked the door? Dude, what are you talking about? No way.
[1246.46s -> 1253.91s]  He's going to kill me right here. I got to go now. Got to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, got to go,
[1253.91s -> 1256.71s]  got to go, got to go, got to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, got it.
[1256.71s -> 1313.40s]  Where is he? Didn't he go in that stall? He's in that stall right now. This shit's locked. What do
[1313.40s -> 1359.58s]  I do? There's a keypad. I don't know the code. Will you take the flashlight? Yes. I got the
[1359.58s -> 1388.82s]  flashlight. How do I use it? Okay. It's equipped. How do I turn the fucking flashlight on? What is
[1388.82s -> 1415.42s]  that? Okay. Screwdriver. Is there a TV here? Can't be the fuck out of here. I don't like this. I don't
[1415.42s -> 1424.84s]  like this at all. I really don't. I unlocked it. What's in here? I don't like this. It's too
[1424.84s -> 1434.18s]  nerve wracking. I don't like it. Okay. I have a screwdriver. What do I do with the screwdriver?
[1434.18s -> 1467.02s]  I thought I could get it. So what do I take the screwdriver? Broken vending machine. Fix it.
[1467.02s -> 1502.31s]  I don't know what the fuck to do. This is back in the bathroom. Shit. It moved. Do I need the
[1502.31s -> 1522.41s]  screwdriver for something else? Literally omega low. This dude's gone. What do you mean I'm gone?
[1522.41s -> 1545.74s]  I'm fine. The bathroom is huge. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Lockers. Come on. Really? Just some
[1545.74s -> 1561.48s]  lockers. That's it? I can't pry one of these open. Oh, you're full of shit. Come on. I was already in
[1561.48s -> 1574.76s]  here. I remember one of the lockers you can open. It was kind of weird. You mean like right here?
[1574.76s -> 1589.69s]  This one has blood on it. You missed the shower. The answer is within this room. Hey, thanks. Where
[1589.69s -> 1607.54s]  am I going though? Shower? There's a shower in the locker. You know, I played Resident Evil 1 when
[1607.54s -> 1614.28s]  I first came out and I got to like the first part where you had to like walk around and find the one
[1614.28s -> 1641.64s]  place to go. I just stopped playing it. There's something below the drain. Oh, there's a key.
[1641.64s -> 1650.26s]  What door do I need to open this with? There's a tiny key. It says 1024. 1024? Is that the...
[1652.66s -> 1677.19s]  Okay. I don't remember where to go. 1024? In their door? That's... Where's that door? Right here.
[1677.99s -> 1699.27s]  Oh, fuck off. What door is locked? 1024. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not this place. 1024.
[1699.27s -> 1726.36s]  In here? Or a locker? No, they don't number the stalls. What am I talking about? It's definitely
[1726.36s -> 1735.69s]  a locker. Where are the lockers? I'm lost in them all. It's a stall like 1024, 1025, 1026.
[1735.69s -> 1746.42s]  I need a map. I don't remember where the lockers are. I have no object permanence.
[1746.50s -> 1752.95s]  If you told me to draw a map of Dust Bowl and TF2, I have a thousand hours on that map. I still...
[1752.95s -> 1762.82s]  I wouldn't be able to draw it for you. I really wouldn't be able to. I got it. All right. 1024.
[1762.82s -> 1772.47s]  How am I supposed to know which one of these is 1024? None of these are numbered. Oh, wait.
[1772.47s -> 1796.57s]  This one is 1024. Hey. SS34. 5534. That's a number. All right. Get out. 5534. This motherfucker's
[1796.57s -> 1826.97s]  going to be right here. Huh? Where am I going? Where's that door? 5534. A toaster. Frigerator.
[1826.97s -> 1860.28s]  It would be rude to take someone's lunch. They're not in there, right? Is that the Jacksepticeye?
[1860.28s -> 1902.38s]  That's so funny. It's too quiet. Janitor Jack. The voices are too quiet. What if Janitor Jack is...
[1902.38s -> 1921.46s]  Hold on. I can't turn the dialogue up. Look out the window. Janitor Jack, I think, is in trouble
[1921.46s -> 1937.67s]  here. Well, Janitor Jack is probably the Easter Bunny. The Easter Bunny's going to walk in here
[1937.67s -> 2008.41s]  and be walking slowly towards me. It's going to be Janitor Jack. Of course it's Janitor Jack.
[2008.41s -> 2021.74s]  I was making a muted joke and it caught me. I was making a, I have no audio joke. Murderhouse.
[2021.74s -> 2049.29s]  It was definitely Janitor Jack. Oh, pancakes. No, that's not it. That was the prologue. Tutorial
[2049.29s -> 2064.62s]  complete and Jacksepticeye as Janitor Jack. Turn the volume up. Ever since the Nun game,
[2064.62s -> 2086.62s]  I'm terrified to turn any of these puppet combo games over 10% audio level. Ever. Did you miss
[2086.62s -> 2097.43s]  the jump scare? You did. The Nun game is literally the loudest shit ever created. Nothing can even
[2097.43s -> 2107.72s]  compare. All right, so now where are we? The lights are already off. I can't turn them off
[2107.72s -> 2119.26s]  anymore. Present day, 1988. This is the murder house and it's for sale. People died in this house.
[2119.26s -> 2152.28s]  Fuck. I have to move? Like we're here. This place? You left you have this after the incident with
[2152.28s -> 2159.61s]  the poodle. That could have happened to anyone. These are all just Sims 1 characters. All right,
[2159.61s -> 2190.58s]  let's get started. We don't have all day. Who? Megalo? He's dead. Make yourself useful and find
[2190.58s -> 2199.94s]  a survey in. That reminds me, somebody made a video of me testing cigars that I saw. It was
[2199.94s -> 2204.55s]  really funny. Anybody got that video? I want to show that video on stream. It's fucking hilarious.
[2206.26s -> 2212.82s]  Somebody took the eating the tearless stuff and they they made it as if I was testing cigars.
[2214.58s -> 2223.69s]  It's so stupid. Does anybody have a link to the video? The actual like video video because like
[2223.69s -> 2236.57s]  pulling it up reddit up is a pain in the ass. He saw it. Oh yeah. Oh, let me get it. Yeah,
[2236.57s -> 2246.54s]  long lost Gerald985 cigar tear list from the 20s. Let me get it. I love this video. It's just so
[2246.54s -> 2273.78s]  dumb. We're going to watch this first. Let's see if I can get it full screened here. Okay,
[2273.78s -> 2286.98s]  is it audio on here? Yeah, this is so fucking stupid. I love it. All right, you ready?
[2286.98s -> 2363.58s]  It's so stupid. Look at all these cigars. Oh Jesus. Okay, let's go. It tastes like marshmallows.
[2363.58s -> 2383.56s]  Wait, my stamina will drain. I have to pick a break. Hold on. Here's this loud game. Too many
[2383.56s -> 2389.27s]  cigars. All right, so do I get to choose who I play with or no? Oh, that's a cool little feature.
[2389.27s -> 2400.09s]  Tracking. All right, so we're here doing a story. This is this person's car, right?
[2400.09s -> 2417.88s]  You look terrifying right now. Why? All right, here's the news van. So I just gotta get in the
[2417.88s -> 2437.38s]  house. This is really creepy. Locked. Windows really dirty. I can't see inside. Can I break in
[2437.38s -> 2473.78s]  here? Oh, the side. The flashlight under your face. We've already done this before. It's an old
[2473.78s -> 2486.92s]  routine. I look green. Why am I green? I'm green and now I can't see. I actually can't see. Turn
[2486.92s -> 2490.76s]  the ring light on. It's all right. It's on right now. That's why you can see my face. I just can't.
[2490.76s -> 2503.22s]  I literally can't see. Can I grab it through here? Looks like a gun. I can't reach from here. Okay,
[2503.22s -> 2520.15s]  are we going to hear a distant scream? We're going to hear like, oh my God, I'm going to go
[2520.15s -> 2535.58s]  investigate. Somebody saw a rodent. I'm a writer too. There's a fellow writer. I, I can't, where am
[2535.58s -> 2549.91s]  I? Why is the camera doing this? Name one book you've read. Sure. Dance of Dragons from a song
[2549.91s -> 2563.82s]  of ice and fire. Book five, 10 years ago. Well, I don't know how to get in there, so I don't think
[2563.82s -> 2587.06s]  I can. Have you ever read the Bible? Um, I think parts of it. Name one book you've read. I don't
[2587.06s -> 2601.24s]  know. I don't, why do I need to prove that I've read a book? It's creepy in here. So I was going
[2601.24s -> 2612.12s]  to open the front door. I don't even have a flashlight. This is stupid. This is dumb what
[2612.12s -> 2635.24s]  I'm doing. I need a flashlight. Can I have gotten a flashlight somewhere that I didn't see? What?
[2635.24s -> 2650.44s]  Empty cabinet. This will make a great hiding spot. Okay. Where do I get a flashlight? It's a big
[2650.44s -> 2668.66s]  basin sink. I don't know where to go. A dryer. It's, I thought it said seasoned. Washing machine.
[2668.66s -> 2675.93s]  Okay. Oh, fuse box. An average fuse box. Wait, I think a fuse is missing. Okay, I need to get a fuse.
[2675.93s -> 2694.65s]  Can I open the door? You've unlocked the door. All right, so everyone can come on in, right?
[2695.53s -> 2711.59s]  Oh, there we go. Okay, so come on in. I found a way in. Do they, do I have to go tell them? Or should
[2711.59s -> 2718.98s]  I just keep exploring? Empty cabinet. Make a great hiding spot. Yep. A greasy fridge. There's no way
[2718.98s -> 2751.43s]  I'm going to open that. Kitchen cabinet. Search it. Yes. Kojima fell off. I don't think Kojima made
[2751.43s -> 2768.70s]  this. What's that? Hole in the floor. I see something shiny at the bottom. I can't reach it.
[2768.70s -> 2783.75s]  I don't have any items. How about, how about I don't have no items? No items? None. I can't open it.
[2783.75s -> 2800.94s]  The doorknob is missing. No items. This is no items. Finally. No. There's enough items. Pencil.
[2800.94s -> 2813.32s]  What the fuck am I going to do with a pencil? Can I pick the lock with the pencil? What's this?
[2813.32s -> 2820.36s]  Stack of boxes. No, no, no. This. Left a note. Hey, it's Jerry, the real estate agent. Looks like
[2820.36s -> 2824.92s]  someone broke the lock on the basement window and got in the house since the last time I was over
[2824.92s -> 2831.03s]  here. They stole the goddamn fuse so the power is out. Don't worry. I know there's another fuse
[2831.03s -> 2834.87s]  around here somewhere. I'd let the front door open in case I don't hear you guys drive up.
[2834.87s -> 2856.71s]  Just shout at me when you get inside. Okay, well where's the fuse? An old dusty mug. I don't want
[2856.71s -> 2870.57s]  to go back down in the basement. Spider on your face. All right, I'm just going to go talk to them
[2870.57s -> 2889.06s]  because the door's open now. I'm going to say, hey, I got a back door. All right, come on in.
[2889.06s -> 2919.48s]  Stupid. Idiots. Idiots. Idiots. Oh, come on. Did I not open? Whatever. Just idiots. I have to unlock
[2919.48s -> 2928.76s]  the front door. Yeah, but I don't know. This is not my house. I don't know where anything is.
[2928.76s -> 2945.43s]  So straight ahead should be the front door. Straight ahead. There we go. Go through here.
[2945.43s -> 2953.74s]  I can't go through there. I don't have a doorknob. Do you know where anything in your house is?
[2953.74s -> 2965.59s]  Oh, there's an upstairs. There's an upstairs. This is the front door right here, but how the
[2965.59s -> 2973.38s]  fu- I couldn't even see it. There's an upstairs, Lois. Fucking goddamn family guy.
[2981.21s -> 2987.64s]  Yeah, you should have. You still can. That's a huge ass microphone, by the way.
[2993.58s -> 3009.54s]  Grab all the equipment in the van. Let's set it up. All right, what do we got here?
[3009.94s -> 3024.38s]  Microphones, lav mics, shotgun mics, C stands, cameras, HD camera, maybe a GoPro to put
[3024.38s -> 3052.63s]  somewhere. He won't finish this in three hours. Shut up. All right, I gotta go to the other one.
[3052.63s -> 3061.21s]  Do I have to unpack it? He won't finish this. What if I don't finish it? Who gives a shit?
[3061.21s -> 3076.79s]  What do you care if I finish this game or not? What do you care? What do you care? Clean the
[3076.79s -> 3095.66s]  camera. No, it's dirty. Why is he so toxic now? I just am, okay? When are you gonna do a comb stream?
[3095.66s -> 3105.70s]  I don't think there's ever gonna be a comb stream ever again. All right, the lights are up, but
[3105.70s -> 3123.94s]  there's no power in this house. I need a fuse, right? Fuse. All right, can you stop smoking?
[3123.94s -> 3138.58s]  Turn it back on. I don't know how. Figure something out. He's a real piece of shit, isn't he?
[3138.58s -> 3150.74s]  23k Andy doesn't care about his chat anymore. That's not true. Do I have a- oh, that's- I
[3150.74s -> 3163.32s]  thought that was a cigar. 23k Andy. Holy shit, there are 23- 24,000 people here. Hope you're
[3163.32s -> 3183.38s]  having a good night, good day. Apparently getting scared. Scary games tonight. I guess that's locked.
[3183.38s -> 3190.60s]  What's with all this bullshit? I'm telling you right now, I could probably elbow drop through
[3190.60s -> 3194.46s]  this and break it and get what's in there. This doesn't look that sturdy. I could just run across
[3194.46s -> 3200.98s]  the room and just slide and tackle and kick this and break it. If I needed to get in there, I could
[3200.98s -> 3221.90s]  literally jump from the bed and just stomp down and land on it and break it. Locked. Okay, there's
[3221.90s -> 3231.24s]  two locked things up here. Covered table. A lot of these hiding spots. I'm imagining this is important
[3231.24s -> 3245.94s]  later. Not right now. This is the locked room. Okay, okay, I have to remember where this is.
[3245.94s -> 3251.78s]  That's the dark room at the end of the hall. So keep that in mind. Write that down. Dark room end
[3251.78s -> 3263.88s]  of the hall has two, three locked things over here. What about this? Hey, that guy that took a four
[3263.88s -> 3287.21s]  month break after dancing. Oh, I can't move this. I need someone up here to move it. Oh, a fuse. Nice.
[3287.21s -> 3308.20s]  Okay, check everything. This is a weird bed. Covered table. Another pencil. What are the pencils for?
[3308.20s -> 3319.48s]  Let me guess. It's a save point. I need to use a pencil to save the game. Stupid fucking god. What
[3319.48s -> 3325.83s]  was that? Stupid fucking god damn fucking idiot. Stupid fucking game. Fucking stupid fucking piece
[3325.83s -> 3341.90s]  of shit game. What is that? Solid iron. No way I can open this. Maybe there's somebody there.
[3341.90s -> 3355.06s]  All right, well I have the fuse. Let's go back down. All right, can somebody help me move the
[3355.06s -> 3369.54s]  thing up there? Later, somebody will help me. Let's go down to the basement again. Locked.
[3369.54s -> 3378.78s]  Flimsy lock. You're a sellout. What did I do? I didn't even do anything. What are you talking
[3378.78s -> 3402.84s]  about? All right, where's the fuse box? This guy buys porn. All right, screw it in. Power's back
[3402.84s -> 3416.14s]  and the washing machine is on. The door is jammed shut. Should I have a pencil on there? Okay, well,
[3416.14s -> 3440.68s]  whatever. I got the power back on. So now what? All right, we're gonna have to do interviews and
[3440.68s -> 3451.24s]  stuff. All right, good. Everything's set, Tom. Lighting's ready. The cameras roll. Hey Gary,
[3451.24s -> 3459.02s]  I was thinking we could- I don't pay you to think, Dana. I pay you to read the goddamn script.
[3459.02s -> 3471.74s]  I hate this job. Well, pull it together. Ready, everyone? What are we doing here? All right,
[3471.74s -> 3481.37s]  action. Anthony Smith, more commonly known as the Easter Ripper. What's her boom mic
[3481.45s -> 3488.73s]  and a handheld mic? The mere mention of his name sends shivers up the spines of parents across
[3488.73s -> 3496.52s]  the country. His horrible murder spree leaving lives shattered and families ripped apart. Tonight
[3496.52s -> 3502.84s]  we'll go inside his vacant home where 11 innocent children spent their final moments in agonizing
[3502.84s -> 3509.16s]  pain and terror. What the fuck? Untouched since those horrible crimes eight years ago,
[3509.80s -> 3516.79s]  some say his spirit still haunts the home till this day. I'm Dana Turner and this is a News
[3516.79s -> 3525.35s]  Nine special report. Silenced tears inside the home of serial killer Anthony Smith.
[3525.35s -> 3530.42s]  Cut. Let's take a break. Gary, I think I want to redo the line where-
[3530.42s -> 3536.26s]  This isn't 60 minutes, Dana. It's channel fucking nine. We're out here to win a Pulitzer.
[3536.26s -> 3543.06s]  So why are we even here? We could have done this whole thing from outside the house. If we're not
[3543.06s -> 3547.86s]  trying to be thorough and have a really deep investigation on this, just do it in front of
[3547.86s -> 3555.34s]  the house and then leave. I'm going to find a place in this gross house to fix my makeup.
[3555.34s -> 3561.94s]  Right? I think I heard that. Wait, did she say I'm going to go fix up my gross makeup?
[3563.35s -> 3573.05s]  What did I just hear? I wasn't paying attention. I don't know. What did she say? Gross house.
[3574.01s -> 3586.71s]  I need to go fix my gross makeup. Okay. So I think why would we stay here? Is it Pulitzer
[3586.71s -> 3599.67s]  or Pulitzer? I don't know, dude. You and I ain't ever going to get one, so it doesn't matter.
[3599.67s -> 3622.95s]  What if they will get it? Speak for yourself. Speak for yourself. Too bad the house doesn't
[3622.95s -> 3639.32s]  have cable. Should I go to bed? I'm sorry, but if you expect to win a Pulitzer prize, I mean,
[3639.32s -> 3647.35s]  you got to just do what you're doing. You don't just say, I'm going to win a Pulitzer prize
[3647.35s -> 3652.90s]  soon. You got to work and get it and work for it. You don't just say I'm going to be a Pulitzer
[3652.90s -> 3657.42s]  prize winner. I mean, I said that like five years ago when I thought that my stream was going to
[3657.42s -> 3663.96s]  really take off and become like this really important thing. What is the Pulitzer prize even
[3663.96s -> 3673.30s]  for? I don't even know. Is the Pulitzer prize science? What is the Pulitzer prize? What is it
[3673.30s -> 3690.58s]  for? It's journalism. Oh, why did I think it was science? What's the science one? The Nobel prize
[3690.58s -> 3710.81s]  is science. Okay. So what do I do? Nobel prize is for whatever. Nobel could be pretty much for
[3710.81s -> 3724.39s]  anything, right? There are lots of different categories. Can I go to bed? I want to find a
[3724.39s -> 3734.81s]  way back into that, whatever it is, a greenhouse or something back there, whatever it is. Go get the
[3734.81s -> 3747.64s]  gun. I need a key or something to get in there. What about down here? The cool one is science
[3747.64s -> 3778.54s]  though. These are all locked. I need a key somewhere. This game is a real talkie by the way.
[3778.54s -> 3828.92s]  Where do I go? A mannequin. Should I try to get into the greenhouse? Help. Whoa. Can you fetch me
[3828.92s -> 3835.80s]  a glass of water? You want a glass of water from here? I think I'm going to say it. I'd probably
[3835.80s -> 3841.21s]  drink my piss before I drank out of this sink. I would drink a glass of my own piss before I
[3841.21s -> 3860.79s]  drank out of the sink here. All right. I need to get a glass of water. That's Vera Lunatic. What?
[3860.79s -> 3874.76s]  Okay. Where do I get a glass to cover it or anything? I need a glass. Why is he always
[3874.76s -> 3884.73s]  talking about drinking piss? Literally said it once in like a year. Fine. I will concede that you
[3884.73s -> 3890.87s]  find me one point in the last year that I said I was going to drink my own piss and I will concede.
[3896.86s -> 3909.26s]  I've said I've did it maybe once in a year. It was literally two weeks ago. No, it wasn't.
[3909.26s -> 3938.46s]  Here's your water. I have no idea where I'm going. I need to deliver the water. The voice
[3938.46s -> 3947.70s]  actors is in chat right now. Oh shit. Really? Dana's VA and you're playing you playing this
[3947.70s -> 3978.42s]  made my night. Good luck. Look, holy shit. That's cool. Wait, did you bash this? Oh, we got to keep
[3978.42s -> 3987.11s]  Dana in the chat. That's cool. And maybe we can get hired on our real network. All right. So I
[3987.11s -> 3996.14s]  got a key. There's a lot of member of the doors. I got a key now. People to sleep here with this
[3996.14s -> 4004.42s]  boring story. Time to sex this up. Hey, you. Me? Yeah, you put this sheet on. Gary, what the fuck
[4004.42s -> 4009.38s]  are you doing? No one's going to want to watch this boring thing. And your dry reporting isn't
[4009.38s -> 4018.17s]  helping. I'm reading the teleprompter. People want to see ghosts. So we're going to fake a ghost
[4018.17s -> 4023.85s]  sighting. Okay, intern, when Dana says he still haunts the home he grew up in, I want you to run
[4023.85s -> 4032.81s]  through the background. Got it? All right. Let's do this. Okay. After Dana says he still haunts the
[4032.81s -> 4038.81s]  home he grew up in, I need to run through the door. Action. The rampage started in late March
[4038.81s -> 4045.45s]  1979, when Smith walked into a local mall and took a seasonal position as an Easter bunny.
[4045.45s -> 4050.65s]  A job meant to spread joy and cheer put him in the perfect position to abduct young children
[4050.65s -> 4058.23s]  until his capture and execution in 1985. Many of the bodies have not been recovered. As told
[4058.23s -> 4063.67s]  by the sole survivor, Randy Martinez, Smith would release the children in his greenhouse
[4063.67s -> 4069.19s]  and force them to go on a deadly Easter egg hunt while he stalked and murdered them. What the
[4069.19s -> 4077.48s]  fuck? Two years later, many say he still haunts the home he grew up in. God damn it. I said one
[4077.48s -> 4090.06s]  time not to stand in the shot. I couldn't. Oh, because A is. A job meant to spread joy and
[4090.22s -> 4101.14s]  cheer put him in the perfect. Relax. A job meant to spread joy and cheer put him in the perfect
[4101.14s -> 4108.57s]  position to abduct young children until his capture and execution in 1985. Many of the bodies
[4108.57s -> 4114.09s]  have not been recovered. As told by the sole survivor, Randy Martinez, I don't know how to
[4114.09s -> 4118.97s]  release the children in his greenhouse. I thought I had to skip the dialogue on a deadly Easter egg
[4118.97s -> 4124.81s]  hunt while he stalked and murdered them. I'm not in the shot right now. Many say he still haunts
[4124.81s -> 4140.97s]  the home he grew up in. God damn it. What? I fucking just ran by. I just ran by. Run through
[4140.97s -> 4146.57s]  the door. A job meant to spread joy and cheer put him in the perfect position to abduct young
[4146.57s -> 4152.57s]  children until his capture and execution in 1985. That's not even in the shot. Many of the bodies
[4152.57s -> 4157.45s]  have not been recovered. That's not in the shot. As told by the sole survivor, Randy Martinez,
[4157.45s -> 4163.53s]  Smith would release the children in his greenhouse and force them to go on a deadly Easter egg hunt
[4163.53s -> 4170.01s]  while he stalked and murdered them. Two years later, many say he still haunts the home he grew
[4170.01s -> 4177.40s]  up in. What was that? Tom, did you get that? I apologized to the viewers at home, but I just
[4177.40s -> 4183.24s]  felt an energy pass by behind me. Let's continue deeper into the house and see what secrets we
[4183.24s -> 4189.82s]  uncover. Cut! This is ratings gold. Let's take a break and pick up in the bedroom. Great timing.
[4189.82s -> 4194.70s]  I'm going to go use the restroom. Hey you, I'm getting hungry. Take the van and go pick us up
[4194.70s -> 4207.14s]  some pizzas. Use the station credit, Todd. Okay. Reddit gold. All right, let's go get some pizzas.
[4207.14s -> 4226.79s]  I'll go get some pizzas. Let's just go with the front door. Fuck it. What's your favorite pizza
[4226.79s -> 4233.05s]  place? What's your favorite pizza place to get a pizza? What is it? A chain. What's your favorite
[4233.05s -> 4248.49s]  chain pizza place? Little Caesars? Domino's? No. I'm sorry, that's wrong. Did you find anything
[4248.49s -> 4253.61s]  juicy yet? Not yet, but I think I'm onto something. I think there's something hidden here that nobody
[4253.61s -> 4260.25s]  knows about. Good work. Domino's? Come on. Don't mention this to anybody, especially Gary. He'll
[4260.25s -> 4266.68s]  steal any story for us. What the fuck? Domino's is good. I don't know. Is it though? I feel like
[4266.68s -> 4274.66s]  it's not. I know what a Domino's pizza tastes like, and it's not, I don't think, I don't,
[4275.22s -> 4285.83s]  I don't remember it being good. Should I do this first? Just to have items?
[4285.83s -> 4295.58s]  No. The sauce is really busting. You drink piss. Why would anyone care about your opinions in this?
[4295.58s -> 4308.54s]  Um, you name one time when I drank piss. I can't open this? What the hell is this key even for?
[4308.54s -> 4327.16s]  Really? Really? What's taking so long? I can't function on an empty stomach. Sorry, I'm going
[4327.16s -> 4333.00s]  to go soon. Soon? Make it pronto. You know, I have not had Little Caesars in a very long time. I feel
[4333.00s -> 4342.23s]  like I'd probably like it. I bet you I would really like Little Caesars. Aren't Little Caesars
[4342.23s -> 4362.39s]  pizzas like three dollars? Aren't they really, really cheap? Five. It's five dollars for a pizza
[4362.39s -> 4370.65s]  at Little Caesars. Five dollars. I'm sorry, but you cannot do better than that. Five bucks for a
[4370.65s -> 4385.74s]  pizza? We're talking five dollars for a full pizza? I feel safe in this room, like nothing bad can
[4385.74s -> 4401.30s]  happen here. Save the game. Okay, so game saved. Are you sure you want this? You'll need to use
[4401.30s -> 4417.14s]  another pencil to save again. Yeah, okay. Flashlight. Hell yeah. Cigar? Oh, it's a pencil.
[4417.14s -> 4436.50s]  Hold on. This is a lot. Let me read this. Little Caesars parent company owns the distribution
[4436.50s -> 4441.78s]  center that sends ingredients to all the pizza chains so they don't have to pay for their
[4441.78s -> 4455.83s]  ingredients like Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut. For real? Really? I mean Pizza Hut. Oh man,
[4455.83s -> 4468.01s]  oh man. Oh man, oh man. I get fucking worked up when I start thinking about Pizza Hut.
[4468.09s -> 4476.18s]  Large stuffed crust pepperoni pizza with a side of eight buffalo tenders in the mild sauce with
[4476.18s -> 4488.71s]  some blue cheese. Oh man, oh man. That's nothing better. It's so fucking good. Everybody can say,
[4489.43s -> 4495.98s]  oh my god, that's gross dude. Oh no, it's not. You're just not, you just don't get it. You know
[4495.98s -> 4501.10s]  what I mean? You just don't get it. If you don't like the stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut
[4501.10s -> 4506.62s]  pepperoni and it's just right out of the oven, you just don't get it to me. To me, you and I,
[4506.62s -> 4512.54s]  we're just never going to get along with the buffalo tenders and they're nice and hot and
[4512.54s -> 4523.80s]  ready and they get the blue cheese on them. What was I doing? I'm playing a game. You just don't
[4523.80s -> 4528.86s]  get it. You just don't get it. That cheese that they put, wait, I actually need to go down here.
[4528.86s -> 4536.10s]  The cheese that they put in the crust at Pizza Hut is a magical cheese that does, I don't know
[4536.10s -> 4545.29s]  where they get it. I don't know what it is. It's magic. It tastes just so delicious. I don't even
[4545.29s -> 4558.18s]  know what it is. Looking at the mod chat, my Pizza Hut went out of business and I tried it once. It
[4558.18s -> 4568.04s]  was terrible. No, you just don't get it. You don't get it. No, you don't get it. You don't get it.
[4568.04s -> 4577.72s]  Okay, I can actually see. What about your thoughts on Costco pizza? I actually don't think I've really
[4577.72s -> 4585.48s]  ever had Costco pizza before. Not that I can really reliably remember. I hear it's pretty good though.
[4585.48s -> 4606.14s]  Okay, I can actually see what's over here. Bridge, place to hide. This is going to make me throw up.
[4606.14s -> 4631.02s]  Empty cabinet and puke. Whoa! Shut up. I wasn't even that big of a deal. This is gonna hurt my
[4631.02s -> 4637.46s]  back. My shoulder hurts now because of that. I just, I actually hurt my shoulder. I just pulled a
[4637.46s -> 4659.94s]  muscle in my shoulder. Oh, let's open this. What is that? A doorknob. Ooh. Okay, let's open up that
[4659.94s -> 4679.32s]  door that needs a doorknob upstairs. You're old, dude. It's getting dark. Yeah, I know I'm old.
[4679.32s -> 4702.79s]  I'm older. Okay, so what's in here? Is that a fire poker? Pretty good weapon. Oh, hell yeah.
[4706.01s -> 4727.22s]  There's weapons? How do I swing? It's unlocked. Oh wait, there's something over here. Old fireplace
[4727.22s -> 4736.70s]  sealed up. Two-handing a fire poker. Yeah, it's dangerous. Yeah, I love Pizza Hut's awesome. It's
[4736.70s -> 4760.50s]  really good. Oh, this is unlocked now. All right. Well, I gotta go get pizza. Are they even open?
[4760.50s -> 4778.86s]  The van. Who would do this? There's a note pinned on the windshield. No where to go now. Looks like
[4778.86s -> 4783.90s]  we'll be playing a game. You'll be hunting eggs. I'll be hunting you. Find them all and you can
[4783.90s -> 4829.80s]  leave. Don't find them and you can't. Find all the eggs. Should I go try to get the gun? Looks
[4829.80s -> 4846.68s]  like a gun. I can't reach it. Yes, I can. Really? Why do I look so scared? Because it's a scary game.
[4846.68s -> 4882.12s]  I don't see any eggs. Stop being YouTube Andy. What are you on about? Can't reach it? I have a
[4882.12s -> 4922.73s]  fire poker. How can I not reach that? Where should I go? I'm gonna go upstairs, I think. I'm going
[4922.73s -> 4942.65s]  upstairs. Where's the safe room? Where are the pizzas? There's something going on here. The van
[4942.65s -> 4947.56s]  has been wrecked and the gate is locked. Where's Tom? I don't know. He's dead. I can't find him
[4947.56s -> 4953.96s]  either. Must be the goddamn real estate agent. I told you to get another 50 bucks when we were
[4953.96s -> 4962.82s]  done. Come out you chicken shit. Damn it, Gary. It's dark and this place is scary and gross.
[4962.82s -> 4969.85s]  Can we finish this? Still holding the mic. Fine. I don't know where the hell Tom is so you're gonna
[4969.85s -> 4976.54s]  have to hold the camera. I don't know how to work this. It's easy. Just hold it steady. That's about
[4976.54s -> 4985.58s]  it. Okay, action. This is Dana Turner on location. How do I zoom in? I've just been informed that we're
[4985.58s -> 4991.66s]  stuck here. Someone has wrecked our van and we can't get our fucking pizza lunch promised by my
[4991.66s -> 4998.70s]  producer. Is Anthony Smith executed in the electric chair in 1985 back from the dead
[4998.70s -> 5004.54s]  and back for revenge on anyone who enters his house? Find out soon if we don't get the fuck
[5004.54s -> 5011.48s]  out of here. That would actually be kind of crazy. I can't work under these conditions. Isn't it like
[5011.48s -> 5027.93s]  10 o'clock at night? Hey intern girl, see if you can find where the hell Tom is. Okay, gotta find Tom.
[5027.93s -> 5041.21s]  I'd be pissed too if I didn't get my pizza. Especially if it was a fucking Pizza Hut stuffed
[5041.21s -> 5059.06s]  crust pizza with a side above a loving her wings. I would be also very annoyed by that. You need to
[5059.06s -> 5079.86s]  shut the fuck up. You need to not care if I like Pizza Hut or not. There's nothing in here, right?
[5079.86s -> 5098.71s]  Shut the fuck up, Jeremy. There's nothing else here. Fuck Pizza Hut. I'm serious. I feel like a
[5098.71s -> 5113.19s]  lot of you guys probably haven't had it in a long time. When was the last time you had Pizza Hut?
[5113.19s -> 5118.58s]  Solid iron key you're gonna need. All right. Well, I don't know where this guy is.
[5118.58s -> 5130.90s]  2011, 1997. That's what I mean. I feel like you're not being fair to the Pizza Hut. Let's stop that.
[5130.90s -> 5147.35s]  Where is this guy? That doesn't count. Like you cannot say I had it in 1992 or something.
[5148.07s -> 5155.96s]  No, even like the air was tasted differently in like the early 90s. Like everything smelled
[5155.96s -> 5167.24s]  different. You know what I mean? Like everything was different. I already picked that up, but
[5167.24s -> 5179.83s]  where is this guy? Probably down. I remember the 90s had a smell. It was, I can't even describe it.
[5183.00s -> 5187.56s]  My everybody's car had a 90s smell. The air just kind of had this, it just smelled like,
[5187.56s -> 5213.40s]  it smelled like the 90s. It's everything had a different smell. What was that? Cabinets locked.
[5214.20s -> 5227.13s]  Tom? Tom, I didn't think I would find you. This is getting weird. Do you think the Easter Ripper
[5227.13s -> 5232.39s]  is back? It looks like we're stuck here. All the doors are locked. Let's get a key blade. We're
[5232.39s -> 5240.98s]  fine. I found a key, but I can't figure out what it opens. Let me see. You take it. Maybe you can
[5240.98s -> 5246.71s]  find the door. I'm going to go look for another way out. I'll catch you later. Okay. So there's
[5247.27s -> 5265.50s]  a lot. This looks like an iron key. That's definitely through the upstairs door.
[5266.22s -> 5286.33s]  Can I get the fuck out of here? Oh my God. I'm walking in circles, dude. Why did I stop? I don't
[5286.33s -> 5307.13s]  know. Dude, I'm wicked fucking high. Okay. You all right? Do weapons have durability? This is
[5307.13s -> 5320.66s]  definitely the key to upstairs. There's no way it's not. Why is she holding this like a lightsaber?
[5322.84s -> 5337.38s]  Only a master of evil, Doth. That's how, that's how Obi-Wan holds his lightsaber. Watch out.
[5345.62s -> 5362.26s]  Only a master of evil, Doth. He's right here. I thought I was downstairs. Get back here. We good?
[5362.26s -> 5403.59s]  No, I want to pick up the microphone. You need to save the game. Where do I do that? How do I
[5403.59s -> 5409.74s]  save the game? Where do I save it? Oh, there's an Easter egg shoved in her mouth. Take the egg.
[5409.74s -> 5451.56s]  I took the death egg. It's under the stairs. Oh my God. So now I'm going to go upstairs and I'm
[5451.56s -> 5486.78s]  going to open the big door. There it is. Circuit breaker or something. I don't think I need to use
[5486.78s -> 5508.15s]  this. Bed frame. Dresser. Ooh, what's that? Letter opener. What can I do with that? A letter opener.
[5508.15s -> 5527.88s]  What did I need? Did I need to use that somewhere? Broken refrigerator. It's a table. I don't think
[5527.88s -> 5546.55s]  there's anything else in here. Got the letter opener. A normal light. That's weird. Why would
[5546.55s -> 5553.32s]  you say a normal light? Letter opener though. It's pretty sharp. I need to find something to
[5553.32s -> 5605.74s]  use this on. Shit. Shit. Letter opener. What do I use the letter opener on? Use it on a letter.
[5605.74s -> 5631.69s]  Can I get it? Can I pick it up? Do this or something? What is down here? So I'm going to
[5631.69s -> 5642.68s]  lift the letter. Open it with a letter opener. Where do I go? Back to the basement? Maybe Tom
[5642.68s -> 5667.99s]  would be down there. I think Tom's probably going to be down here. Is Tom still here? Tom? I can
[5667.99s -> 5739.78s]  hide in there. Where is he? Shit. I heard a bunch of bullshit over here. Letter opener. That works.
[5739.78s -> 5749.26s]  I can actually pry it open. Magnet. I can get the gun. What the? There are hairs in my mouth. I can
[5749.26s -> 5793.19s]  get the gun with the magnet. God, he's going to be right here. What's that mean? It means he's
[5793.19s -> 5826.66s]  coming. It means he's coming. Upstairs? There's a locked door up there. No. Major stream of reactions
[5826.66s -> 5849.38s]  coming up here. Really? Just go in here for a second so I can breathe. Where is there more
[5849.38s -> 5868.89s]  locked doors? There's one down the hall here. I think that's it. There's a locked door down the
[5868.89s -> 5897.46s]  hall. There it is. A note. The big bunny watches us. Its big black eye follows me when I move.
[5897.46s -> 5901.70s]  It always watches. At night we hear noises coming from the walls. The first time I heard them,
[5901.70s -> 5907.96s]  I got happy because I thought it was you and mommy shouting for me, coming to save me, but it wasn't.
[5907.96s -> 5913.90s]  When the shouting starts, the others cover their ears, but I try and listen. I put my head against
[5913.90s -> 5918.46s]  the wall and hold my breath, but no matter how hard I try, I can't understand what they're saying.
[5918.46s -> 5924.82s]  They shout and cry a lot. It isn't mommy and it isn't you, but it sounds like adults and they
[5924.82s -> 5934.15s]  sound sad. Really sad. Did the Easter Bunny take them? Dana is dead. I thought that was a bunny.
[5934.89s -> 5939.24s]  Help me find an exit. Uh oh. Oh no.
[5969.46s -> 5974.81s]  Black light? Just a stupid black light. What am I going to do with this?
[6001.74s -> 6013.48s]  Oh, that's... I'm far back, aren't I? This video game is a genuine first generation copy
[6013.48s -> 6018.52s]  produced on behalf of and with the approval of... What is that?
[6028.78s -> 6044.25s]  Oh, that's just the intro. Fuck. All right. Oh shit. Where was I on this? I got the...
[6044.25s -> 6055.19s]  Oh fuck. All right, where was I? I don't remember. I gotta get the magnet from downstairs,
[6057.83s -> 6065.77s]  magnet from down in the basement, come up, get that, go upstairs, right? What do I mean? No,
[6065.85s -> 6072.28s]  fuck. I need the letter opener. Where's the letter opener? Letter opener is up. Oh,
[6077.38s -> 6089.11s]  letter opener. I need more pencils. All right. At least I know where he comes in.
[6089.11s -> 6094.90s]  That's not the wrong save, but I went down. We're going to watch Gary. Yeah. Okay,
[6094.90s -> 6100.42s]  letter opener, down to get the magnet, up. All right. I need to save the game again.
[6101.06s -> 6128.42s]  Okay, let's go. This is the right save. Okay, down, basement, letter opener, thing,
[6129.30s -> 6144.82s]  get the magnet, magnetize, save the game, and then whatever. Where's the fucking basement?
[6144.82s -> 6159.54s]  What game is this? This is Murder House. It's a house where people get murdered and you have to
[6159.54s -> 6173.26s]  solve the mystery. Where is it? It's in here, right? I only have three saves total. Should I
[6173.26s -> 6190.23s]  not use it? Should I try to get around the bunny and then save it after that? You just have to run.
[6192.20s -> 6201.86s]  You suck at this. It's a horror game. Come on. All right, so let me get out of here. Go upstairs.
[6201.86s -> 6212.04s]  Maybe I should just save it. Who cares? All right. I really don't want to do this again.
[6212.04s -> 6220.01s]  Your health is too low to fight. Maybe I'll just save it then and go upstairs.
[6220.01s -> 6246.07s]  Your health is too low. Do you have any potions or food? I don't think I do. Where do you get
[6246.07s -> 6255.22s]  heals? I have the thing that looks like I can heal. Okay, here we go. I'm just going to save
[6255.22s -> 6286.58s]  it. Whatever. If it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea. What are you guys doing? All right, let's go.
[6286.58s -> 6305.00s]  This time, I'm going to try just to run by. Let me scope out some areas here. All right, so what's
[6305.00s -> 6315.48s]  where's a good hiding spot? I could just probably kill him. Where's there a hiding spot in here?
[6315.48s -> 6369.03s]  Is there one? Is that? No. He's gone. What? Oh no, I need to take this. Why is he not here?
[6369.03s -> 6405.40s]  I'm confused. Why is he not here? Oh, that's back upstairs. Okay, what does that do? Does
[6405.40s -> 6412.70s]  that reveal anything? Can I hide in something here? No, where can I hide in here? It's very
[6412.70s -> 6456.66s]  important. Itchy face. It's a dumbwaiter. A rack of torture devices. Oh, I unlocked it. Okay,
[6456.66s -> 6517.22s]  I need to save the game. This is the door right here. I need to save the game. I told you. I knew
[6517.22s -> 6541.35s]  I was doing the right thing. Where is he? Why won't he walk over here? Why? Why won't you come over
[6541.35s -> 6567.35s]  here? I'm trying to lose him. Oh, fuck it. Let's go. Torture devices. Why does it keep doing that?
[6575.22s -> 6589.00s]  It's not even him. He visited again. No one saw him, but we woke up and there was a big basket of
[6589.00s -> 6593.72s]  eggs. I was so hungry. I need to take the wrapping off. We all took big bites, but the blonde girl,
[6593.72s -> 6598.04s]  when she took her bite, her mouth was covered in blood. She dropped the egg and inside the
[6598.04s -> 6602.52s]  chocolate, the Easter bunny had played a trick and put sharp razor blades. There was a lot of blood
[6602.52s -> 6640.47s]  and she wouldn't stop screaming and the wall started to laugh. Man, faster if you could. My
[6640.47s -> 6661.74s]  God. You got to be fucking kidding me, dude. This is fucked up. Long girl's gone. Gracie won't
[6661.74s -> 6666.22s]  stop staring at the big bunny on the wall. Randy says the chocolate eggs make us sleepy. Not going
[6666.22s -> 6675.08s]  to eat tonight. Randy told me to memorize this song. I don't know what he means. 8883-553-1212-10108.
[6675.08s -> 6687.05s]  Somebody write that down. Thank God. I just have to get out of here safely and I can save it again.
[6687.61s -> 6704.74s]  I'm going to be sick. Oh, okay. I got to get out of here. How do I get out of here? I actually need
[6704.74s -> 6720.42s]  to get out of here and go save. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?
[6720.98s -> 6729.14s]  Do I need to take this? Okay. I got to get out of here. Okay. Let's get out. Get out. Give me out.
[6729.14s -> 6733.50s]  Give me the fuck out of here. Okay. Get me the fuck out. Get me the fuck out of here.
[6734.39s -> 6737.67s]  Get me the fuck out. Get me the fuck out now. Get me the fuck out. Give me the fuck out. I'm
[6737.67s -> 6746.04s]  going for the head, by the way. I'm going for the fucking head. I'm going for the fucking head.
[6746.04s -> 6777.38s]  I got to get out. I got to save the game. Fight or flight. I'm going for the head. I'm literally
[6777.38s -> 6781.24s]  going for the head. I'm going to swing as hard as I can into the person's head. You know what I
[6781.24s -> 6784.68s]  mean? Just like I'm going to crow hop twice and go right to the head as hard as I can.
[6789.82s -> 6804.07s]  What the fuck? No, don't go into this weird chamber. Oh my God. Oh no. He's going to come
[6804.07s -> 6808.07s]  down. He's going to... Did he open the door? Oh my God. Go in the dumb waiter. Go in the dumb
[6808.07s -> 6821.30s]  waiter. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Huh? I couldn't go up the dumb waiter. I took it down. I took
[6821.30s -> 6837.30s]  the thing down. Oh, fuck that. Come on. Oh, shut up. Okay. Well, I know we come through there now.
[6839.45s -> 6846.90s]  Please do infomercials instead. Fuck. Now I got to go up and then down and then up and then down
[6846.90s -> 6854.02s]  and then left and then up and then down and down and then right and then... Oh, come on. Do I really
[6854.02s -> 6865.37s]  have to do all this again? No. Wait, where is this saved? Is this not the wrong save? No, it's not
[6865.37s -> 6879.16s]  the wrong save. All right. He dies up here and then I got to go down and then... Oh, fuck. I'm just
[6879.16s -> 6883.03s]  going to run. I'm going to run. I'm just going to run. I got freaked out that time because I thought
[6883.03s -> 6902.23s]  he grabbed me and I thought I was going to get in a death animation. Oh, this is fucked up. I got
[6902.23s -> 6925.61s]  to go upstairs. How come he's not here? All right. We go upstairs, do the black light, move the thing,
[6925.61s -> 6933.93s]  go down, get the... What was it? The rope or something? We go up here, do the black light,
[6933.93s -> 6949.34s]  move the thing, go down the dumb waiter, get the pencil, get the rope. You need to open the draws.
[6949.34s -> 6969.40s]  You already did this part. Yeah, I know. I know. This and then I just got to run. I'm just running.
[6969.40s -> 6981.11s]  This dude's accent is really exotic. Exotic. I barely have a Boston accent anymore. Sometimes.
[6981.11s -> 6986.62s]  What? Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Just get in,
[6986.62s -> 6998.01s]  just go in and just pick up the shit off the ground and then leave. Fuck out of the way.
[6998.01s -> 7003.58s]  What was in? There was something in here. There's a pencil, I think. Right? Yep. Okay. Get the pencil,
[7004.46s -> 7011.32s]  get the rope and then get out. Please say harbor. Yeah, I know you wanted me to say like harbor,
[7011.32s -> 7024.63s]  but I did that. Whatever. Leave. Then I'm just running through and I'm going... What do I need
[7024.63s -> 7032.01s]  to go from here? The save room. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Get me out. Out, out, out,
[7032.01s -> 7043.08s]  out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. Nothing else. And I was running. Oh, wait,
[7043.08s -> 7053.22s]  was something in here? I forget. Was anything in here? No, it's just a note. Maybe I have to
[7053.22s -> 7063.50s]  have it read. Okay. All right. I fucking hate this. Here we go. You need to drink Coke starlight.
[7063.50s -> 7074.89s]  All right. So should I just run? I think I'm just going to run. Here we go. Run. Just run straight.
[7074.89s -> 7104.82s]  Run. Where the fuck am I going? What did I just do? Where's the up? Where's up? Where's up?
[7104.82s -> 7117.66s]  Where's up? Where's up? I need to go up. Where's up? Right here. Get me to the save point right now.
[7117.66s -> 7151.59s]  I need to save point. Oh my God. Tom's camera. I'm so stressed. Me too. What does it say? It
[7151.59s -> 7155.51s]  feels like somebody's holding the door shut. What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
[7155.51s -> 7162.79s]  I can't go in here. You got to be shitting me. I can't save the fucking game right now. You can't
[7162.79s -> 7190.14s]  be serious, right? You can't be serious. What am I supposed to do about this shit? Where am I?
[7190.14s -> 7210.68s]  Where's my character? Where's my character? Where's my character? This is the wrong room.
[7210.68s -> 7226.46s]  Oh my goodness. Are you okay? Gary's dead. What's this? An egg. I got to go to the TV room,
[7226.46s -> 7238.66s]  which was the room right next to this. Okay. Okay. All right. Give me out. Please don't be here. Oh,
[7238.66s -> 7249.51s]  fuck you. Okay. Was it, was there a number over there? Where's the room that has the TV in it?
[7249.51s -> 7257.83s]  It's this one here. I don't remember which one has the TV in it. I can't save the game. The door
[7257.83s -> 7267.98s]  is closed. Save? What do you mean save? The door is shut. Somebody's holding it shut. Oh, thank God.
[7267.98s -> 7289.67s]  This is just pure anxiety. Okay. At least I can save it. Now I'm not scared if I die. All right.
[7289.67s -> 7306.36s]  I got to go watch the TV. It's in the room that I was looking at before. Is it this one here?
[7306.36s -> 7325.24s]  What, what room is it? It's not this one. Is it down the hall? I don't remember where it is.
[7325.24s -> 7340.76s]  What's your favorite pizza? Stuffed crust from Pizza Hut. It's the best. Is it this one? Okay.
[7340.76s -> 7348.62s]  Here we go. I need to make sure I can hide somewhere. Can I hide under here? Can I hide in
[7348.62s -> 7355.42s]  here? No. I got to find a place where I can hide because I'm going to watch this tape and then this
[7355.42s -> 7363.21s]  asshole is going to come in this room. I can't, I need two people to move this. Okay. We're gonna,
[7363.21s -> 7369.61s]  I'm hiding right now because I just heard somebody crying. This motherfucker is probably coming up
[7369.61s -> 7405.61s]  here now. You didn't just open the door, right? Okay. Here we go. Let's run with the piano in the,
[7405.69s -> 7423.37s]  are you going to hide in the piano? Okay. Oh no, not Tom. Did he, did the killer hide something
[7423.37s -> 7436.68s]  in the piano? That piano room is the one with the fireplace. Where is that? I think it's upstairs.
[7437.24s -> 7454.46s]  This is the last egg. It's down on the stairs, the red door at the bottom of the stairs.
[7454.46s -> 7465.27s]  Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. I don't have any saves. I wish I could just
[7466.07s -> 7495.53s]  save state right now. I must be in use the piano.
[7498.87s -> 7531.77s]  Super Mario eight, eight, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[7531.77s -> 7570.65s]  12, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. That's an old McDonald. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh
[7570.65s -> 7574.95s]  God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
[7574.95s -> 7592.50s]  Hide. Hide. Hide. He's an Easter basket. Does it need more eggs than this? Oh fuck. Where do I go
[7592.50s -> 7617.98s]  from here? What should I do? What should I go? What should I do? What should I do? I'm hiding in
[7617.98s -> 7670.73s]  here. Is he here? What's that? Did I get there in enough time? I think I'm good. No, I didn't want
[7670.73s -> 7679.45s]  to come. I wanted to look at my menu. What do I have for items? I have rope. What if I take this
[7679.45s -> 7692.62s]  rope? Can I go outside and get the shotgun? Use the rope to get the shotgun, right? Like, yeah,
[7692.62s -> 7695.70s]  I think it's go get the rope with the scope, get the gun with the shirt with the go get the rope
[7695.70s -> 7714.25s]  with the shotgun. Help me. Right. Bod watchers sniff. I got to go up to the wardrobe. Can I
[7714.25s -> 7722.10s]  actually use the rope and pull the thing? Where is that? Oh my God. He's here. That's upstairs
[7722.10s -> 7727.75s]  in the room with the TV, right? I don't want to fuck around because I don't want to go all the
[7727.75s -> 7741.74s]  way back. That's upstairs room with television. I don't remember where that is though. My brain
[7741.74s -> 7754.62s]  just can't do it. Where is that fucking wardrobe? It's upstairs somewhere. Something else here?
[7797.70s -> 7824.07s]  Gun. Do I have any bullets in this gun? Excuse me. How do I use this? Okay. I have a gun now. Yes.
[7824.07s -> 7857.96s]  I can save it. Where am I going? I'm trying to go to move the wardrobe. I don't know where
[7857.96s -> 7880.57s]  that is, but we're going to go. It's the game is stressing me to fuck out. Save it. Save it
[7880.57s -> 7898.38s]  right now. I just don't know where the bunny is going to show up. It took him five minutes to
[7898.38s -> 7912.70s]  get here. I know, but I hate not. I hate not being able to save. I'm just doing it. I hate not being
[7912.70s -> 7956.22s]  able to save. Cry more. Is it? I think tie the rope around this and pull it down. Um, what the
[7956.22s -> 7990.04s]  hell is this bathroom? I'm not opening that yet. Search it. It's cabinet. How can it? Oh, band-aids.
[7990.04s -> 7999.14s]  Should I take those now? I'm at warning health sucker. I can recover some health. Am I don't,
[7999.14s -> 8011.38s]  I'm not going to take it till I'm red, right? I can take one more hit. I think. Okay. That's unlocked
[8011.38s -> 8032.70s]  toilet. Ooh, pencil. Good. Weird. Okay. All right. I'm going to open the curtain. Here we go. I'm
[8032.70s -> 8041.86s]  ready to shoot. Whatever's over here. Wait, unlock this too. Probably right. Yep. The real estate
[8041.86s -> 8082.33s]  agent. That's the last egg. The egg room was the piano room, right? I'm not saving it yet.
[8082.33s -> 8108.97s]  This didn't take that far to get here. Unlock the exit. You bastard. Now what do I do? Is there
[8108.97s -> 8118.60s]  anything I haven't checked? How do you reload the gun? How do I reload the gun? Is that eight or
[8118.60s -> 8145.61s]  three? How do I reload the gun? I'm saving it. It's a zero out of three. How do I reload? All right.
[8145.61s -> 8162.39s]  Third slot zero out of three. How do I use? How do I reload? So where's the exit then? I'm trying
[8162.39s -> 8183.43s]  to think of a door that didn't open. Is there an exit? Holy shit. I don't know where I'm going.
[8183.43s -> 8219.83s]  I just, I think I just walked in this way to go. No, put the fucking gun on, dude. Put the fucking
[8219.83s -> 8234.38s]  gun on. Get out of here. How do I get out of here? How do I get out of here? How do I get out of
[8234.38s -> 8240.62s]  here? Is he still chasing? Which way do I go? Don't run through the main entrance. That didn't work.
[8240.62s -> 8260.54s]  It's locked. We're stuck in here. Down into the basement. Okay. How do I get to the basement
[8260.54s -> 8301.94s]  from here? Okay. Got done. How do I get out of here? I get the fuck out of here. How do we get
[8301.94s -> 8329.48s]  out of here through here? It's open. This has bullets, right? This has bullets. It says zero
[8329.48s -> 8335.83s]  out of three, but how can I reload it? How do I reload the fucking gun? Zero out of three.
[8335.83s -> 8345.77s]  I need to reload the gun. Reload the gun. How do you reload the gun? Three is the max. Oh,
[8345.77s -> 8370.23s]  fuck. This is bad. Where's the shotgun? Where's the shotgun? It's here somewhere. Where is it?
[8370.23s -> 8391.02s]  Where's the shotgun? I'm going to blow this guy to hell. Where is it? Where's the shotgun?
[8391.02s -> 8406.15s]  There it is. Right? It has to be. Give me. Give me. Quick. This guy's dead. All right. Now get
[8406.15s -> 8420.63s]  me out of here and get me to the car. Where's the exit to the greenhouse? Am I supposed to know who
[8420.63s -> 8435.30s]  this is? Tom? That's right. It was quiet. Innocent, Tom. Harmless. Walk all over him, Tom. Mama's boy,
[8435.30s -> 8450.14s]  Tom. When I did, I killed them all. Why? To avenge my brother. Anthony wasn't the Easter Ripper.
[8450.14s -> 8458.74s]  I was. He turned himself in to save me. I thought I could control the urge to kill,
[8458.74s -> 8470.81s]  but it's back. And now I'm going to kill you. Tom. Tom. I have a shotgun in my hands and you're
[8470.81s -> 8530.87s]  holding a sickle. You want to do the math there real quick? Oh my God. Don't die. Oh no. Why won't
[8530.87s -> 8535.19s]  he die? I shot him four or five times with a shotgun. What? He's bulletproof. What the hell
[8535.19s -> 8549.90s]  was that? Give me a break. What was that bullshit? All right. So what do I do? Wait, wait, wait.
[8549.90s -> 8554.20s]  Where am I right now? I just have to go down to the dumbwaiter. Just go down to the basement.
[8554.20s -> 8560.38s]  Right? I still have heal. I'm not going to use it. Down to the basement and then out.
[8560.38s -> 8576.02s]  Just like I was before. Yeah. Let's get out of here. Just get out. There's all the eggs. Okay.
[8576.82s -> 8592.54s]  Out. Have you tried talking it through with them? You can find more ammo. I think I'll be all right.
[8592.54s -> 8614.87s]  Fucking don't know. I still don't know where the hell I'm going down here. I need to hit him with
[8614.87s -> 8630.95s]  the... Okay. Get me out. I need... I have a heal. I'm not going to waste it. If I need to fire poker,
[8630.95s -> 8638.18s]  I'll just swing and run. I have a heal. I'm not going to use it yet. I can take one hit from the
[8638.18s -> 8651.86s]  sickle. Stop touching your nose. I'm a weirdo, man. I'm going to be touching my face. Give me
[8651.86s -> 8659.03s]  the shotgun. I can't... No, dude. I wasn't ready to leave. What are you doing? I'm not ready. I was
[8659.03s -> 8682.78s]  trying to walk over. Why? God damn it, Tom. Oh my goodness. I'm just getting stuck on everything.
[8682.78s -> 8695.35s]  Tank controls are the shittiest things ever. Just get the fuck out of my way, Tom. What happened?
[8698.23s -> 8705.70s]  Oh my God. Tank controls are the stupidest fucking things on earth.
[8723.94s -> 8733.78s]  Just kill me. Fucking please. Just kill me. Oh my God. Tank and... Fucking God. I'm going FPS.
[8733.78s -> 8738.82s]  I don't give a fuck for this. I'm just going FPS. I'm going to FPS this guy. Hold on. Let me play a
[8738.82s -> 8752.44s]  video game. Damn motherfucker. Why is auto aim turned off? I don't know. I'm going fucking FPS.
[8752.44s -> 8759.78s]  I don't care. You can call skill issue all you want. I ain't... No. I'm sorry. That was weird.
[8759.78s -> 8773.77s]  I'm going FPS. And I'm going to auto aim. And I'm going to get rumbled in here. Okay. I don't give
[8773.77s -> 8789.40s]  a shit. Let's go. I'm ready. Melania didn't make you this mad. Yeah. Well, Melania also... Melania
[8789.40s -> 8801.32s]  also, I don't have to run through half a fucking level to get to... Where's my... There it is. Down
[8801.32s -> 8847.74s]  to the basement. You need to start with a summon. I'm fine. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. I'm not using
[8847.74s -> 8858.63s]  mouse and... Wait. Should I use mouse and keyboard for this? All right. Mouse and keyboard. What the
[8858.63s -> 8873.99s]  fuck? No. It's weird. I don't like it. It's weird. I don't like it. It's weird. Okay. Don't go that
[8873.99s -> 8880.62s]  way. Go over here. Give me the shotgun. I'm going to shoot this guy four times and I'm going to beat
[8880.62s -> 8912.90s]  the fuck out of him with this wrench or whatever the hell this is. Okay. Come on. Where is he?
[8912.90s -> 8971.64s]  That's right. To avenge my brother. Get out of the venue. Swing. I had another round. I did, man.
[8971.64s -> 8993.80s]  I had another shotgun shell. It wouldn't shoot. I had another shot. I did. Do the math. God damn
[8993.80s -> 9011.24s]  it. Where can I get some more bullets? He's not going to show up, right? If he does, then whatever.
[9011.24s -> 9027.83s]  I'm going to get bullets. Somebody sit in the attic. I need bullets. There are draws here for the
[9027.83s -> 9054.34s]  letter opener. You shitting me. Where? Where? I don't see any. Where? No. I don't see any. Where?
[9054.34s -> 9088.17s]  In the corner and a pencil. That's like a washing machine. Where? Where? You full of shit.
[9093.18s -> 9121.78s]  You said in the basement. There's more ammo. The attic in the basement. I thought you said attic,
[9121.78s -> 9138.92s]  not basement. You said attic. Anywhere else I could look. That was hot. That was a hot slice
[9138.92s -> 9158.76s]  of pizza. There's nothing in here. Only ammo is in the basement at the end of the hallway.
[9158.76s -> 9169.98s]  Are you kidding me? Did I already get it though? I feel like I already did it. In the basement.
[9169.98s -> 9186.55s]  I already get it. In the basement at the end of the hall. You're full of shit. I found it.
[9186.55s -> 9201.58s]  What is that? Oh, this is a big first aid kit. Oh, that's not what I want. Basement at the end
[9201.58s -> 9218.42s]  of the hall. Use the bandages. Bandages. Okay. You're telling me there's ammo down here. Is
[9218.42s -> 9246.34s]  that what you're saying? You're telling me there's ammo down here. That's what you said to me. What
[9246.34s -> 9262.12s]  do you want about? I need help. You need to tell me. I walked by it. No help. No help. No help. No
[9262.12s -> 9273.08s]  help. We said the attic. It's down in the actual dungeon. Well, I need to go down there anyways.
[9273.08s -> 9304.28s]  This one here. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. I just got to go. I got to go. I'm
[9304.28s -> 9308.10s]  just leaving. I'm just going to go. I don't need to save it. Fuck it. He's right here. All right.
[9308.10s -> 9320.33s]  I've got pistol. I've got full health pack and I've got everything I need. All right. Pistol,
[9320.33s -> 9330.06s]  full health pack and a shotgun coming up. You do the math. We're going to start with the pistol.
[9330.06s -> 9339.90s]  It's eight shots and then we're going to move to shotgun to finish it. I have a full health pack.
[9339.90s -> 9365.78s]  I should not fuck this up. Okay. Here we go. Bang, bang. I can take that if I need to. I'm ready.
[9365.78s -> 9381.94s]  Here we go. Eight shots. I'm going to run first of all. I'm going to get across the whole map.
[9381.94s -> 9387.35s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[9419.67s -> 9439.26s]  How many was that? Eight? How many was that? I got one more shot.
[9481.82s -> 9544.36s]  What the heck? Did I win? That was too... I don't like games like that. It's just too
[9544.36s -> 9554.42s]  trust. It's too stressful. It's too stressful. That was pretty, that was pretty crazy.
[9554.42s -> 9577.24s]  That was too stressful. Well, there you go. The info of that was murder house and then
[9577.24s -> 9589.16s]  blood wash. You aged 20 years playing that. Is there a new game plus? I'm going to wait
[9589.16s -> 9599.08s]  to see if there's anything after credits. You know what else I was looking over at the mod chat too?
[9601.96s -> 9608.90s]  There's those, the dread collection. I haven't done any of those. It's kind of like a jackbox
[9608.90s -> 9617.24s]  horror game party pack. I could probably do those at some point. Play Nunn Massacre. I already did
[9617.24s -> 9628.90s]  and I kind of said I'm never coming back to it. Yeah, there's five of them or something, right?
[9632.15s -> 9642.22s]  Dodge caravan sliding door dot wave by CGFX. Unlock and lock a door with key.
[9643.18s -> 9656.71s]  Page turn. Draw slam two. When did I play Nunn Massacre? I think that was when I did all the
[9656.71s -> 9672.28s]  Itch.io games, right? Yeah, I think we could probably call... Maybe I'll play... Vampire
[9672.28s -> 9677.48s]  Survivors got an update, right? Somebody's saying that. Maybe I'll play a round of that.
[9677.48s -> 9685.18s]  Wind down with some Vampire Survivors and then call it. That sounds good. What do they add?
[9691.26s -> 9708.94s]  It's a hell of an update. Really? There's a... We're still in the credits. You should play Stay
[9708.94s -> 9717.66s]  Out of the House. If you have... I said a few weeks ago that if you have a one to three hour long
[9717.66s -> 9721.34s]  horror experience that you want me to play, throw it in the recommended in the discord
[9721.34s -> 9735.72s]  because I feel like I missed all these. It's a long credit sequence. It really is. System Shock?
[9735.72s -> 9749.38s]  Ah, maybe not. Yeah, play Stay Out of the House. Okay. Do you even read that channel? I'd say once
[9749.38s -> 9754.66s]  every week or two, probably once every two or three weeks, I will just open discord solely to
[9754.66s -> 9761.61s]  look at the recommended channel. Tons of stuff I pulled over the last year from there. I go,
[9761.61s -> 9768.92s]  oh, okay, that seems pretty cool. So I check it all the time. I really do. I might not be that
[9768.92s -> 9773.56s]  active on discord, but I check that channel a lot whenever, you know, every few weeks.
[9774.12s -> 9788.71s]  I kind of just scroll back. What about the comments on the second Jerma videos? I will tell you I
[9788.71s -> 9795.46s]  don't think I've read a YouTube comment, goodness, in probably five years. It's been a long time.
[9800.38s -> 9814.89s]  I don't think I've read a YouTube comment in five years. Go read them now. Holy shit, did 500 people
[9814.89s -> 9829.93s]  work on this? This is crazy. There's a lot of people. I think it was good. I love this old PS1
[9830.49s -> 9844.79s]  aesthetic. I'm glad it came back. Did you play Soma? Yeah, one day. This is, oh, it's Patreon.
[9844.79s -> 9851.32s]  Okay. For a second, I thought we were still in, okay, all right, it's Patreon. Okay. I was like,
[9851.32s -> 9861.46s]  holy shit, a lot of people worked on this. Didn't you say that you hated it like three weeks ago?
[9862.55s -> 9879.59s]  Soma? What do you mean? I said I hated Soma? Go reply to a YouTube comment from 2020.
[9882.62s -> 9890.78s]  I don't think so. I want to see if there's anything at the end here. I'm very curious.
[9893.14s -> 9903.18s]  New squirrel stapler. What about Bloodborne PSX? I don't think I'll ever play it. That's really cool.
[9904.58s -> 9913.99s]  But I played so much Bloodborne that I feel like I wouldn't like it. I feel like I would play that
[9914.71s -> 9923.05s]  and be, I just want to play the regular Bloodborne. It's really short. How is it short? Is it the whole
[9923.05s -> 9937.69s]  game? It's not the whole game. Oh, I thought it was just a, it's not the whole game. Oh, it's its own
[9937.69s -> 9944.84s]  thing. What? Okay. I didn't know that. I'm going to look into that now. I thought it was the whole
[9944.84s -> 9959.94s]  game. Okay. All right. All right. Anything after the credits? Cut. Brilliant. Congratulations, guys.
[9959.94s -> 9967.70s]  That's a wrap. A wrap? That ending doesn't make any sense. Well, it's a wrap anyway. Oh, it was
[9967.70s -> 9982.82s]  just a horror movie. It was just a horror movie? Can I put the mic down now? Clapping the clapper
[9982.82s -> 9993.03s]  is my job. All day. Clap, clap, clap. It's enough to drive you crazy. Okay. I would hate to have to
[9993.03s -> 9999.14s]  edit this piece of shit. What do you think? I think it's stupid. Hey, how would I know Nick
[9999.14s -> 10006.09s]  would skip town two days before we wrapped up the shoot? But Tom, he's not even tall enough to be
[10006.09s -> 10015.72s]  to kill it. Don't worry about it. No one's going to notice. What? What's in the house? What's in
[10015.72s -> 10032.26s]  the attic? Pizza. Any more pizza? No, your buddy Dan finished it up. I'm starving. There's plenty
[10032.26s -> 10053.99s]  of gelatin salad. Yeah, I'll think about that. It's not that bad. Gelatin salad? Is that? Wait,
[10053.99s -> 10068.47s]  why is there blood here then? Is it fake blood? Maybe what happened to Nick, huh? Who? The guy
[10068.47s -> 10073.29s]  who played the Easter Ripper. Oh, that guy? He was a weirdo. He didn't say anything to me the whole
[10073.29s -> 10104.14s]  shoot. Easter Ripper costumes. Okay. So what's in the basement then? Anything in the basement?
[10104.14s -> 10141.83s]  Save the game? I don't think I need to. It's post credits. Okay. So what's down here? Skeletons?
[10141.83s -> 10190.57s]  Yeah. Thank you. It took me so long to pose them. So what the heck? What am I supposed to do? What
[10190.57s -> 10197.80s]  am I going to do? Tuber commentary? This would be a pretty shitty tuber commentary. I'm just going
[10197.80s -> 10211.50s]  like this. Where do I go? Do I go down? Where do I go? This would be pretty awful with tuber commentary.
[10211.50s -> 10222.44s]  Oh, can I get a poll in chat? I need to get a poll in chat from a mod. When you brush your teeth,
[10222.44s -> 10257.80s]  dude, sometimes you go, it's very important. Do you gag? I guess. I don't know. Not every time,
[10257.80s -> 10270.79s]  but sometimes you just kind of go like, and I'm not talking like crazy. That was a little too
[10270.79s -> 10290.74s]  too much. I don't mean like, I mean very lightly, just like a, no, guys, you don't brush your teeth
[10290.74s -> 10300.33s]  and go, oh my God. I'm not talking about like this. Why can I not open this thing? I'm not talking
[10300.33s -> 10310.01s]  about going like, no, I'm talking about like when you brush your tongue. I'm not sitting there
[10310.01s -> 10334.98s]  brushing my teeth and I was puking. That'd be weird. What do you mean you don't brush your tongue?
[10334.98s -> 10340.50s]  Oh, we've got some people in this chat with some fucking stank ass breath. You don't brush your
[10340.50s -> 10380.41s]  tongue? Okay. I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at here. What? There's nothing here.
[10380.41s -> 10395.11s]  Brush your tongue. I just, I not, you don't have to do it. Fine. That's fine. But I brush my tongue
[10395.11s -> 10404.70s]  because yeah, you can have like smelly breath. Go to the front door. What was in the attic?
[10404.70s -> 10424.47s]  20% of chatters. Hold on. Do you brush your tongue? You don't, don't, I'm not talking to go crazy.
[10424.47s -> 10428.23s]  It's just very light, but maybe that would explain why maybe 20% of you don't go,
[10429.43s -> 10438.02s]  but even the people that do brush their tongue, I feel like that's maybe you say, I do, I do
[10438.02s -> 10445.08s]  brush my tongue, but dude, why, what are you doing? But sometimes you're in a fucking hurry.
[10445.08s -> 10449.00s]  Sometimes it's like, oh, I got to brush my teeth, but I got something to do. So I got somewhere to
[10449.00s -> 10455.48s]  be real quick. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay. All right. Go, go, go. Rinse, rinse, rinse,
[10455.48s -> 10469.46s]  rinse, rinse. Sometimes it happens. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here. Something's
[10469.46s -> 10477.27s]  supposed to happen. Somebody's missing. You need to go to bed. I'm going to play one round of vampire
[10477.27s -> 10501.83s]  survivors. I don't know where to go. Do you guys have a, I'm not reading that one. Okay. Well,
[10501.83s -> 10520.22s]  that was cool. I can't, I, it's cut off, but I think it's when wiping your ass. Can you imagine
[10520.22s -> 10524.54s]  somebody is, Hey man, I'll be right back. I'm going to take a shit. Yeah. I'm just going to
[10524.54s -> 10537.93s]  use your bathroom for a little bit. And they leave. You just hear it's like, holy shit. Like,
[10537.93s -> 10544.89s]  what do you mean? Are you like, you're wiping your ass and are you like puking or like gagging
[10544.89s -> 10561.40s]  because it smells? I'm 36 and we're going to move on. Okay. It smells so bad in the bathroom that
[10561.48s -> 10568.49s]  you're gagging to your own business, dude. Okay. I'm 36 this time. We have to move on. I can,
[10568.49s -> 10575.37s]  this is ridiculous. This is a ridiculous conversation to have. Do I just walk home?
[10575.37s -> 10602.17s]  Where do I go? Just in the bathroom taking a shit. What are you doing? Rehearsing for my next role.
[10602.17s -> 10609.70s]  What's that? Bikini babes on werewolf planet. I play queen Zion. Except you want to help with the
[10609.86s -> 10618.46s]  part. Sure. Queen Zion. People are realizing you're 36.
[10627.96s -> 10633.32s]  Isn't it in my info? I should put it in my info.
[10639.46s -> 10648.74s]  You think I'm a fool? Take their bikinis. You'll have to settle for just
[10648.74s -> 10665.80s]  a bit. What do you think? You're great. You look 26. It's wild. It's called I
[10665.80s -> 10674.92s]  moisturize. I moisturize my skin. Everybody says question mark. What are you talking about? When
[10674.92s -> 10684.46s]  I come out of the shower, brush my teeth, I dry my hair, I shampoo and condition at least once,
[10684.46s -> 10694.33s]  twice a week. You don't be careful not to shampoo too much, but I usually do. So when I come out of
[10694.33s -> 10702.62s]  the shower, dry off and I use, you want to know what I use? Would you like to know? You want to
[10702.62s -> 10710.23s]  know what I use? You want to know what brand I use? Is that what this is? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fine.
[10710.23s -> 10718.01s]  Sure. I use the, it's, it's called the belief cream and it's called the Aqua bomb. You can get
[10718.01s -> 10726.20s]  it at Sephora. I've been using it for fucking a decade almost every day. I'm not shit. I'm not
[10726.20s -> 10734.34s]  kidding. It's the belief cream. It's called the Aqua bomb. It's this light. This is, that was
[10734.34s -> 10743.35s]  blinking for a second and you just do a little bit. It's really light. It's kind of like a gel
[10748.76s -> 10767.18s]  and this is how, when you're 40, you'll look fucking 25. Damn it. I look good. How do I leave
[10767.18s -> 10791.82s]  the trailer? You're 40? Not yet. Okay. So how do I get it through this? It's nighttime,
[10791.82s -> 10808.31s]  $40 moisturizer. Everybody shut up. That moisturizer will last you a very long time,
[10808.31s -> 10815.02s]  an incredibly long time. This is not, you don't open the container and smear it like, like pick
[10815.02s -> 10819.10s]  it up like this and then drag it all over your face. You didn't use the whole bowl.
[10820.92s -> 10826.74s]  You do a dab. You open up the container. You take your ring finger or your middle finger,
[10829.10s -> 10833.67s]  just a little bit, and then get it on the cheekbones right here under the eyes. Don't
[10833.67s -> 10838.97s]  put it in your eyes. Are you crazy? Come up here onto the forehead, on the nose, the chin,
[10838.97s -> 10848.78s]  and then cleanly smear it around in a semi-circle. You're not going like this and drenching your
[10848.86s -> 10856.22s]  face. No, that will last you two, three months. And guess what? Taking care of your skin,
[10856.22s -> 10861.06s]  the biggest organ. I bet you didn't know this. You're a scientist. It's the biggest organ in
[10861.06s -> 10864.47s]  your whole body. You got to take care of it. It's the biggest organ in your whole body.
[10864.47s -> 10871.03s]  You should be taking care of it. Bet you didn't know that. I'm going to quit the game because I
[10871.03s -> 10874.30s]  don't know what to do. If you don't want me to quit the game and see the last bit of the ending,
[10874.30s -> 10915.45s]  just tell me where to go. The other trailer. What's wrong with you? Too many pizzas.
[10915.45s -> 10926.38s]  How many did you eat? Three. Slices? No, pizzas. I was bored. Not much left to do since I died.
[10926.38s -> 10933.51s]  Oh, thank God. Maybe someone could give me a ride into town off this hell set.
[10933.51s -> 10940.68s]  Yeah, skincare. Take care of your skin. You know people really got killed in this house.
[10940.68s -> 10949.30s]  That's just a rumor. Watch how much sun you're getting. It's nice to get sun, but just be
[10949.30s -> 10957.00s]  careful how much sun you're getting. You know, you don't want to be out there just cooking. Use
[10957.00s -> 10965.61s]  a good moisturizer. No one cares. I do. I need a hot shower after this sleazy picture. I do.
[10970.92s -> 10982.31s]  I do. All right, so that was fun. That was fun. I'm going to just leave now. Go to the car.
[10982.31s -> 10997.24s]  What temperature are your showers? I wouldn't say too hot. Not too hot. Not too cold. Hot, hot,
[10997.24s -> 11011.40s]  hot showers. They kind of make me feel weird. I don't like it. I don't have my keys. I must
[11011.40s -> 11025.08s]  have dropped them somewhere. Oh, where are my keys? The keys are in the basement. Somebody said I'm
[11025.08s -> 11035.16s]  literally buying that. I don't like moisturizers that are really heavy, greasy. Cream. It's not a
[11035.16s -> 11049.62s]  cream. It's a light gel cream. It's not what you think. It's not one of those. Nope. It's light.
[11049.62s -> 11071.40s]  You're giving ads for free. I don't care. I've talked about things that I use in company. I can't
[11071.40s -> 11082.68s]  just say that I like something. Somebody has to pay me to tell you that I like a product. That's
[11082.68s -> 11111.03s]  not going to happen. I mean, if they do. All right. Where are these keys? That's not a requirement
[11111.03s -> 11121.77s]  in the basement. I'm in the basement. Where are these keys? Come on. Come on, Gwen. Really?
[11121.77s -> 11140.74s]  For here? In the dungeon? When are you going to do a skincare stream? Do you know where my keys are?
[11140.74s -> 11156.38s]  So much to do down here. There are my keys. Hey, hey, hey. What are those? What are those
[11156.38s -> 11164.04s]  brown slacks called? Oh, they're called cockies. How do you drive your car off with fucking cockies?
[11164.04s -> 11197.21s]  Could have been playing vampire survivors. Smash the desk. Okay. Bye guys. It was fun making the
[11197.21s -> 11219.69s]  movie. I really hope it's not a real killer that comes out and grabs me. Let's party. Did you guys
[11219.69s -> 11229.05s]  have to ruin all of these costumes? You shouldn't have eaten any gelatin salad. You're weird for
[11229.05s -> 11250.50s]  eating it in the first place. I shot about 30 slashing movies this year. All that hard work
[11250.50s -> 11275.19s]  finally paid off. I feel like I would be dancing like this too. That was a fun party. All right.
[11275.19s -> 11295.43s]  Goodbye. That was a fun party. What? Oh, I'm not cleaning up. I'm sorry. If you are at the party,
[11295.43s -> 11300.76s]  then you clean up. If I walk through the party to say goodbye, I am not obligated to clean up the
[11300.76s -> 11309.21s]  party. That's not how that works. If I'm not participating in the party, then I'm not going
[11309.21s -> 11333.02s]  to clean up the party. Oh my God. Look at the backseat. What is that? Oh my goodness. I'm so
[11333.02s -> 11354.07s]  nervous. I did. Okay. We did. I did. I could have just ended like 30 minutes ago. All right. Let's
[11354.07s -> 11360.02s]  do vampire survivors. That was a good game. That's fun. I actually enjoyed that. Give me one second
[11360.02s -> 11362.90s]  while I open up vampire survivors.
