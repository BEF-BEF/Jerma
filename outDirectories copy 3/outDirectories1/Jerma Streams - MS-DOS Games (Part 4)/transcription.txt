[0.57s -> 11.32s]  Hello everybody. Welcome, welcome. I did hear, I did hear about it. I've seen it. It's crazy.
[11.32s -> 17.61s]  I guess we'll open with that. Uh, so the TF2 economy has, uh, doesn't exist anymore.
[18.74s -> 25.69s]  Unusuals are just free. Everybody gets one? Yeah, I saw that. They're gonna fix it though, right?
[26.92s -> 30.92s]  They're gonna pull back any item that's been opened in the last, like, day or so.
[32.81s -> 43.00s]  They'll do an unusual rollback period and then everybody that sold their $3,000 TF2 hat
[44.23s -> 49.35s]  for like three bucks. That might not, that's gonna, that's just hold on to your stuff. Just hold.
[59.96s -> 65.67s]  This happened before? Yeah, it'll be, I think it'll probably be fine. It is like kind of humorous
[65.67s -> 72.25s]  though to see screenshots of people's backpacks with like 50 unusuals that they opened like 10
[72.25s -> 83.99s]  minutes ago. I don't play TF2 anymore, but it's still interesting to keep up sometimes. He's
[83.99s -> 94.30s]  telling you not to sell. Don't, just don't sell. You can't panic sell. You do what we all do. You
[94.30s -> 107.66s]  hold that shit to zero and then sell it for 30 cents. Yeah, buy high, don't sell and then
[108.62s -> 121.24s]  panic sell for less than 95% of your initial investment. Monster Rancher is getting ported,
[121.24s -> 129.18s]  but I heard it was Japanese only. So, and how are they gonna do that? It's gonna be digital only
[130.14s -> 143.82s]  port. It's just gonna, what do you do? How do you do that without the discs? We'll see. But I heard
[143.82s -> 155.22s]  that was only going to Japan first. So who knows if it'll ever show up in the North American market.
[156.02s -> 166.92s]  Who knows? When am I gonna go to Japan? I don't know. I've wanted to take a trip to Japan.
[167.72s -> 177.82s]  Probably since I was 16, 17. Just one of those places that I've always wanted to go.
[178.46s -> 190.97s]  Never had a chance. It's just an interesting place. No, it's not, it's not, it's not because
[190.97s -> 203.46s]  of the anime. It's just, Japan's an interesting place. It really is. It seems really fun and
[203.46s -> 215.21s]  interesting. Yeah. Oh yeah. I would, I can't wait to travel to Japan because of the anime. Sure.
[216.17s -> 226.23s]  Not like the incredible culture and the massive history. No, no, no, no, anime. That's why I want
[226.23s -> 239.42s]  to go. Anyways, speaking of none of the things we're just talking about, we're going to play
[240.54s -> 248.04s]  DOS games today. We're going to hang out for a little bit. I said a while ago I wanted to do
[248.04s -> 258.65s]  DOS nights. The last time we did this is probably three weeks ago. Maybe more. So hey, DOS night
[258.65s -> 268.30s]  number four or five, whatever the hell it is. And I have picked a few to start just to kind of get
[268.30s -> 275.88s]  the ball rolling. Play Mario Sunshine or Riot. That's not a DOS game. That is a, that is Nintendo
[275.88s -> 283.70s]  GameCube. That's not for Microsoft distributed online systems. What do you mean? Yes, it is.
[287.80s -> 301.22s]  There's no MS DOS version of Mario Sunshine. Sunshine was ported to DOS. How? Doesn't DOS,
[301.22s -> 312.86s]  isn't the the entire operating system of DOS a hundred kilobytes? No, I'm getting lied to.
[312.86s -> 318.86s]  Anyways, let's go. I've already got it all set up. We'll do some picking later,
[319.66s -> 325.45s]  but I saw a couple that I just had to click on immediately. And the first one we're going to do
[325.45s -> 332.41s]  is, let's see if I can get it on here. Yeah, the first one we're going to do is called Donald Ducks
[332.41s -> 342.76s]  Playground by the Walt Disney Company. I just saw Donald Duck and I clicked it immediately.
[342.76s -> 359.42s]  Okay, here we go. Let's get it on here. Are you going to work? Please work. Please work. Please
[359.42s -> 407.78s]  work. Please work. There we go. Donald Ducks Playground. What are we doing? Oh, Donald wants
[407.78s -> 427.50s]  to build a playground in the park for his nephews. He works in these stores to earn money. Hey, here's
[427.58s -> 432.28s]  the word. All right, let's go. He works at the train station.
[440.12s -> 472.58s]  Donald buys toys for today. How do I play? When words appear here, press the enter key or a
[472.58s -> 481.18s]  joystick button. Okay, so the reason why I did that is so I don't have to do that for like another
[481.18s -> 493.13s]  three years. I get asked to do that all the fucking time. So there's this this three years worth of
[493.21s -> 499.99s]  me doing that like six or seven out of ten beatbox. Okay, there you go. All right,
[499.99s -> 502.95s]  when words appear here, press the enter key or a joystick button to get in here. Okay.
[505.94s -> 513.27s]  Oh, I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do it again. Please walk through a doorway to choose a level. How do
[513.27s -> 527.16s]  I walk through a doorway? Oh, no, no, no, no. This is a game for children, right? I mean,
[527.16s -> 537.46s]  I can do intermediate. He's doing the walk. If you guys know what I mean. Intermediate.
[541.93s -> 558.58s]  Advanced. No. All right. You have to help me though. Okay, so I have to. I'm moving way faster
[558.58s -> 568.62s]  now. This controls like Snake, by the way. I can't control this. Toys. How long do you want to work
[568.62s -> 585.51s]  a two minute shift? Yeah, I want to work a one minute shift, please. Sure. Let's go. Use the
[585.51s -> 591.43s]  joystick or arrow keys to change the minutes below. Press the button to start work. I mean,
[591.43s -> 616.89s]  press the button. Press the button? How? What button? Press it. I can't. Press the button.
[616.89s -> 627.40s]  There is no button to press. Is the button? How do I walk? Press any key. Enter. I think I would
[627.40s -> 639.98s]  have a... I need to play this. Come on. W A S D. No. M. B. B for button. P. L. K. Space. Shift.
[642.55s -> 657.78s]  Right. F. G. H. Z. It's not Z. Damn it, I have to play this. It's X! The Amquac Special will pass
[658.34s -> 672.15s]  in zero minutes. What? This is every single Super Nintendo RPG you've ever played. There's a
[672.15s -> 678.94s]  sequence where the character freaks out and runs around to collect stuff. And this is it. Oh, I got
[678.94s -> 692.12s]  it. Put it in the trash? Oh, what? What am I supposed to do? Am I just breaking shit? I'm breaking
[692.12s -> 718.68s]  stuff. Oh, guys, this is gonna be impossible. I need to go... What? Um, it's playing Pac-Man.
[718.68s -> 733.11s]  Only times five speed. I have to get it perfect. It's too many FPS. Anybody know how to... How do
[733.11s -> 751.53s]  I fix this? I think there's a way I can, right? Do I have to make my monitor, like, 30 hertz?
[752.25s -> 768.28s]  How much do... I have no money. Turn down the cycles. Right click, set FPS, custom jubated.
[768.28s -> 778.60s]  Fuck. Why? I have to lower the speed of the CPU. I know there's a way you can do it from inside here.
[778.60s -> 792.15s]  Somebody know the key? Go into the DOS box options. I know there's a way to do it. Somebody showed
[792.15s -> 797.19s]  me this before, didn't they? All right, well, I'm just gonna wait till 37 seconds is up.
[798.41s -> 812.54s]  F11? I'm just gonna wait till I fail. Somebody said, do you guys ever get tired of tormenting
[812.54s -> 821.58s]  this man? What do you mean tormenting this man? So, wait, control F11. Is that gonna, like, open up
[821.58s -> 829.40s]  fucking Siri or something? Like, somebody... I need somebody to confirm this. That's not gonna open up,
[829.40s -> 840.66s]  like, oh, it's me, Siri. Control F11 slows it down. It's the Siri hotkey. Time's up. Press a button
[840.66s -> 844.98s]  to leave. Okay, listen. You've earned nothing. For a second, I thought it was putting me in jail.
[852.15s -> 858.63s]  Does that work? I need at least, like, a 95% in chat. People say it's control plus shift plus T
[858.63s -> 875.42s]  is time. Control F11? Did it work? It did. Right? Okay, yeah. Thank God for some of these fucking
[876.06s -> 892.65s]  super brains in chat. Five for ten dollars. Let's see what this does. You have zero dollars.
[892.65s -> 904.66s]  Rocking horse. Who is that? Why am I shaking? Hey, hey, do you have any of those things I made for
[904.66s -> 926.31s]  my nephews? Like, slow down. That's a tetherball? Donald, like, crack duck. All right, let's go to
[926.31s -> 938.41s]  hardware store. Let me go to work. Do I have to work for Mickey? Hi, Mickey. Enter? No? I can't do
[938.41s -> 956.81s]  a Donald Duck voice, so I'm not gonna try. You forgot this tutorial for a child's game.
[958.22s -> 964.14s]  No, no, I didn't. What I did is I was going, all right, I was going 5,000 miles per hour
[964.14s -> 985.06s]  in a child's game. There's a difference. Okay, how long do you, let's, here we go.
[985.78s -> 990.90s]  I want to work for, I don't want to do that long. Let's do a one, a two minute shift.
[991.62s -> 999.35s]  All right, now, what do I have to do? Am I Donald Duck the air traffic controller?
[1001.42s -> 1018.34s]  What am I doing? Okay, we got, what? What's the plan? What do I do? Put, this goes into,
[1021.21s -> 1032.54s]  what? Okay, this is luggage, I think. Okay, luggage. Is that going in? I'm just throwing
[1032.54s -> 1047.66s]  luggage out the window. Oh, Las Vegas! I want that one. No, no, give me that. I didn't catch it,
[1047.66s -> 1055.56s]  apparently. What airport is S? I'm hitting the button when it comes by, all right? I swear.
[1055.56s -> 1075.85s]  All right, there you go. I need it. Okay, I got it. I'm good. I really hope this is, no,
[1075.85s -> 1085.77s]  I've only earned 36 cents. That's pretty unbelievable, actually. Well, I mean, for one
[1085.77s -> 1107.34s]  minute of work, what does that turn out to be for an hour? I just let go of it. Okay, you can't let
[1107.34s -> 1117.64s]  go of the ass airport. I have to actually put it back down and then, okay, awardee, come on.
[1118.44s -> 1133.32s]  So, what, 81 cents? Atlanta. All right, time's up. 81 cents for a minute of work.
[1133.96s -> 1150.79s]  That's a dollar a minute. That's a pretty good job. That's, that's $60 an hour. You earned,
[1151.43s -> 1166.04s]  did they take taxes out? No, you earned 81 cents. Okay, that's cool. So, now what do I want to buy?
[1166.04s -> 1169.72s]  I need to buy toys for the park. What about the deals? Let's go to the train station.
[1174.52s -> 1189.98s]  Donald Duck doesn't pay his taxes. No, we can't, you can't teach kids about taxes this early.
[1189.98s -> 1201.62s]  How long do you want to work? Um, you have to do at least a three minute. No, one minute. This
[1201.62s -> 1212.02s]  advanced railroad. So, I have to route cars? Pick up at Duck City. Which one is that? Duck City is,
[1212.02s -> 1222.15s]  where's Duck City? Four? What? No, no, no, no. I have to, okay, hold on. I have to route it.
[1222.15s -> 1230.04s]  Where's it going? All right, pick up at Duck City. We need to route you from, no, go this way,
[1230.04s -> 1246.98s]  Donald. What are you doing? Okay, when I press left twice, he goes right. Oh, it's because he
[1246.98s -> 1256.50s]  goes, he just stops. He stops. No, he doesn't. Three. I need to turn him. No, he's about to go
[1256.50s -> 1266.60s]  to Duckburg. I desperately want to just turn at four. It needs to happen at four or five.
[1267.48s -> 1281.69s]  Well, I didn't, I didn't do anything. I have to at least buy one item before I move on.
[1282.17s -> 1289.37s]  What's this one? Zero dollars an hour. Well, that would be zero dollars in a minute.
[1290.01s -> 1301.18s]  How long do you want to work? Uh, one, uh, two minutes. So, this is a catch the, I think I
[1301.18s -> 1308.55s]  figured it out. All right, I'm gonna make a ton of money on this one. Wait, why do they need me? He
[1308.55s -> 1322.89s]  just threw it in there. Okay, hold on. You can clearly just make the throw. Why do I have to
[1322.89s -> 1334.97s]  be here to catch it? That guy could walk two or three feet to the left and make the throw. This is
[1334.97s -> 1342.71s]  so sloppy because I can't stop moving. When I hit right, he just keeps going all the way to the
[1342.71s -> 1380.54s]  right. Donald Duck, you suck. I, oh my God. I can't do it, man. It's too, I know what's going on.
[1392.47s -> 1410.90s]  My CPU was on too slow. What the fuck happened? That just dropped off. I didn't catch that one
[1410.90s -> 1422.98s]  somehow. Oh my God, whatever. I don't care. You made what, 40 cents? That's actually a pound for
[1422.98s -> 1432.23s]  pound better than the other one. All right, what is that? I have a dollar 17. Can I get that? Can
[1432.23s -> 1438.15s]  I afford it? Let's, let's, every time I get out here, I want to go a little faster. I think I've
[1438.15s -> 1451.96s]  done all the jobs I can do. Uh, $10, $5 and $10. What about junk? Do the nephews care that much?
[1457.30s -> 1468.87s]  Old box. Slide for fort. Tire swing. It's 71 cents for the tire swing. Okay, hold on.
[1470.01s -> 1479.19s]  Rope and pulley. Ladder to tree house. All right, well, let's get the old box. Let's get him a
[1479.19s -> 1486.14s]  cardboard box. Hello, says Goofy. Walk to the item you want. Press the button to take it.
[1486.14s -> 1509.51s]  Pay me for it over here. All right, you have to pay. Where am I? Uh, just kidding, Goofy. Don't
[1509.51s -> 1526.02s]  worry. All right, I want the tire swing and I want the cardboard box. Okay, please pay for your
[1526.02s -> 1536.79s]  purchases now. Yeah, please pay for your purchases. Now you owe $1.9. You have a dollar. All right,
[1536.79s -> 1550.30s]  $1. I told you that it's playing snake. I can't stop this. Okay, 20. When you are done, move
[1551.18s -> 1572.28s]  the arrow to the register T total key and press the button. Okay, 50 cents, 75 cents,
[1583.80s -> 1591.61s]  there, 85 cents, 95 cents. Do I have enough? I don't have enough. No, I do. There's a dollar
[1591.61s -> 1608.30s]  right here. Dollar five. Do I get change? Goofy will give me change, right? All right, that's it.
[1608.30s -> 1614.84s]  Give me change, Goofy. Thank you. Please make change. Why don't, wait, did I just, do I have
[1614.84s -> 1623.35s]  to walk behind the counter and make the change? Goofy, what the hell do you do here? It's $20.
[1623.35s -> 1633.94s]  $20. I don't know anything about math, Donald. That's okay, Goofy. I'll take care of you.
[1634.66s -> 1661.42s]  No, I don't want to give it back. Oh, God. Okay, press button to leave. Goofy's just fucking
[1661.42s -> 1677.37s]  really dumb. This is just paper, Goofy. The coins are the real valuable ones. Well, that makes sense.
[1677.85s -> 1697.13s]  I'm not done with this one. I write on paper every day. Not every day that I see silver. All
[1697.13s -> 1709.86s]  right, I'm going to do this one. Move faster, Donald. Fuck. All right, I'll do two minutes.
[1709.86s -> 1714.70s]  Now that I have, I can actually do it. All right, slow down though. This is still too fast. All
[1714.70s -> 1722.04s]  right, give me, no, no, no, no, give me this. Have I figured out what the hell's going on here?
[1722.04s -> 1729.94s]  Do I have to put this up here? Actually, I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm
[1729.94s -> 1743.40s]  doing. Do I have to get, I think I have to get this from the top shelf? I have to push the ladder.
[1743.40s -> 1782.74s]  How do I push the ladder? Oh, my God. Oh, no, catch it. I don't know. I don't understand this part.
[1782.74s -> 1794.17s]  Is this, this is once broken. It just is. Okay, I can't fix this one. This, there's no, there's not
[1794.17s -> 1801.99s]  like a, what's the Freddy pizza game? This is not, what the hell is it called? Five Nights at Freddy's.
[1801.99s -> 1810.71s]  We're like, oh, something crazy is gonna happen and Donald Duck's gonna murder somebody. That's
[1810.71s -> 1848.26s]  actually, the game is broken. All right, how do I just skip work? I, I like this Donald Duck though.
[1848.98s -> 1862.20s]  This doesn't look as really cute. Don't you think? All right, let's go. You're nothing. I have six
[1862.20s -> 1887.78s]  cents. When does this game end? Can I leave this area, this part of town? That's went in the well?
[1887.78s -> 1895.19s]  No. Oh, the park. This is the park. Okay, let's go. Can I like piss on the hydrant?
[1899.38s -> 1910.33s]  Duckburg, the city park. Like, can I get on the train? Wait, oh, I looked both ways before
[1910.33s -> 1924.71s]  crossing the street. Donald Duck is really like fucking playing with his life here. All right,
[1924.71s -> 1940.22s]  let's go. Is this still Donald Duck? No, this is Huey. Do I have to bring the items with me?
[1945.86s -> 1966.34s]  Are these Mickey's gallows? Can I just walk the, all the way? Is there anything over here?
[1968.01s -> 1976.81s]  No, I have to go. That's like the boy's little hut or something, right? Can you get hit by the
[1976.81s -> 1983.77s]  train? I'm going to say 100%. No, I don't think they would code in Donald Duck getting hit by a
[1983.77s -> 1991.05s]  fucking train. In, all right, I'm gonna do the airport one again. Now I got money on this one.
[1991.05s -> 2001.70s]  I'm gonna get some more money. All right, I'm gonna do two minutes of this and then,
[2001.70s -> 2006.52s]  I know you guys want me to move on, but I can't. This is gonna be really very fast. Hold on, slow
[2006.52s -> 2021.42s]  it down. Okay, I'll get, I'm gonna do this quick. No, no, get it. BMG, BTR, JFK, and TVL.
[2025.34s -> 2028.46s]  Let me make it, let me just at least get one more like cool item for the, for the kids,
[2028.46s -> 2055.80s]  you know what I mean? What? Oh fuck, come on. BTR, JFK, BMG. You idiot. How much more time do I have?
[2055.80s -> 2062.63s]  I have a lot of time. I gotta get five bucks to buy something cool in like Mickey's store.
[2063.27s -> 2076.22s]  Where's the mini store? I don't know who's in there. BTR. I have a new strategy. It's called
[2076.22s -> 2096.15s]  do the minimum amount of work. What? Well, it's BTL. No, I'm gonna stick with the original strategy.
[2096.15s -> 2126.07s]  BTR. That's close enough. Dollar 35? I should have just stayed in BTR. Come on. Like three of them
[2126.07s -> 2133.37s]  just went by. Four of them went by. Where are, come on, where are they? They had no more? Maybe,
[2133.37s -> 2139.77s]  maybe the game knows I'm trying to do that. Oh, whatever. Dollar 62. He's still playing this. I
[2139.77s -> 2147.11s]  know. Sometimes when you find one you have to stick with it to see what happens. We got paper money
[2147.11s -> 2164.57s]  now. I'm gonna do, what's another easy one? The train one is too all over the place for me.
[2166.09s -> 2174.66s]  This one. I'll get this one. The farm one. It's been on this game for a half an hour.
[2177.18s -> 2195.80s]  No, I haven't. It has not been a half an hour. Has it? Yeah, it actually has been half an hour.
[2197.42s -> 2204.66s]  Oh man. Um, it's all right. It's all right. Let me just, let me just put one object in. Let me just
[2204.66s -> 2219.37s]  go to my house. What? Why did I drop that? No, this one sucks. Okay, can I afford anything for two
[2219.37s -> 2229.78s]  dollars? No, this is not enough money. I'm doing it really well right now. It doesn't matter.
[2234.76s -> 2241.05s]  That's it. How did that not go in the tomato bucket? Oh my god. 33 cents. All right, I'm gonna buy
[2241.05s -> 2259.30s]  something. Look, it's teaching kids how to count money with their hands. All right, here we go.
[2260.76s -> 2266.76s]  I'm gonna go buy a cool toy and then I'll be done. And we can move on to the next one that I have
[2266.76s -> 2275.13s]  here. Donald Duck can barely make ends meet, yet he spends his last change on his children's gifts
[2275.13s -> 2291.34s]  for Christmas. Donald can go hungry tonight for his children's joy in their faces. What the fuck?
[2291.34s -> 2299.05s]  That's fucked up. All right, what do we got? All right, I can do the, uh, tether ball is a dollar
[2299.05s -> 2312.65s]  ninety-nine. Rocking horse is, okay, let's get the rocking horse. Please pay for your money. All
[2312.65s -> 2324.06s]  right, I don't want, I want to keep the dollar. Put it on the counter. When you are done, move,
[2324.06s -> 2342.86s]  yeah, to the, to the t. Yeah, I know. 57 cents. Press done now. Um, what do you mean press done
[2342.86s -> 2353.11s]  now? It's gonna tell me I'm wrong. Sorry, no sale. Yeah, there's no, like, bartering system.
[2354.82s -> 2367.38s]  All right, that's 55.57. One more penny. Your purchase will be delivered. Well, delivered where?
[2368.02s -> 2380.57s]  How do I just go back to my house? Where is it being delivered to? To the park? All right,
[2380.57s -> 2402.81s]  if it's not at the park, then I'm moving on. Please, this game is killing me. I like this one.
[2408.50s -> 2426.39s]  Where is my stuff? They're not actually sending it to me. Wait, oh shit. Found it. And you guys
[2426.39s -> 2442.17s]  didn't want to see. I can play with all the toys as Huey. Tire swing. Nice. Really, really nice.
[2442.17s -> 2456.79s]  All right, what else is there? Where's my box? Do you see the cardboard box? That was kind of cute
[2456.79s -> 2469.29s]  for 30 seconds. Yeah, we had to get a payoff, even if it took 40 minutes. So what is supposed
[2469.29s -> 2485.19s]  to go up there? Keep playing this so chat can suffer. Um, a little confused by, uh, so Donald
[2485.19s -> 2494.15s]  Duck somehow can't afford to buy cardboard boxes and has to work for a dollar, but has a Elon Musk
[2494.15s -> 2504.86s]  space shuttle in his backyard. Well, we know how he lost all of his money. Why is this a slide?
[2505.98s -> 2516.55s]  Hold on. This is important. Is this a like a water slide? That's a themed water slide.
[2526.14s -> 2538.74s]  That's my favorite. Jump on and jump off. That's all you need. This can be so many things. I want
[2538.74s -> 2551.50s]  to go to the slide. Can I go to the other side? No, that's it. It's just a rocket back here. Get
[2551.50s -> 2565.22s]  the ladder. Hold on. Do I have to get the ladder? How much is the ladder? Speed up time? I think it
[2565.22s -> 2575.86s]  says maximum speed. Yeah, this is at max speed, guys. All right, let me just get the ladder and
[2575.86s -> 2582.95s]  let me go up. I want to do the slide. This will be quick. Where's the ladder? Hardware. How much is
[2582.95s -> 2599.06s]  it? No, it's not. Where is it? Uh, ship's wheel. Hand walking rope. Nope. Where is it? There it is.
[2599.06s -> 2613.67s]  $2.95. What do I have? $1.46. I got it. I'll do this really fast. We're gonna do uh just uh this
[2613.67s -> 2619.10s]  one airport one. It's really fast speed. I make a dollar. I'm done. Just hold on. Wait one minute.
[2619.10s -> 2630.44s]  Go. I just want to see if we can get up on the top of the slide because this is going too fast.
[2631.00s -> 2651.90s]  All right, I need uh I need lip. BTL. Come on. Oh, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop,
[2651.90s -> 2669.08s]  stop, stop, stop. Really? I need a dollar. I need one dollar. Pick it up. Oh god. No, that's BTR.
[2669.64s -> 2691.61s]  I need SFD. It's, it's on too fast. How much do I have? 171, 181, 199. How much is the ladder?
[2691.61s -> 2700.22s]  Two something, right? I'll do it again. I need to see what the ladder does. Like this is the only,
[2700.22s -> 2706.92s]  I will never have this opportunity again my entire life. Nobody will, you'll never see this again,
[2706.92s -> 2726.46s]  ever. Don't you need to know? I need like 50 cents, 60 cents. I need to know. Oh my god,
[2726.46s -> 2736.41s]  why can I not pick anything up? BTL, PSP. I just, it's hard. I can't even read them.
[2749.30s -> 2764.47s]  Come on, one more. Oh my god. BTL. All right, I got it. I got enough. I'm gonna have exact change.
[2764.47s -> 2792.90s]  No, not. All right, I'm good. Let's go. It was 240 something, wasn't it? Speed it up. Don't get the
[2792.90s -> 2805.75s]  ladder. Get the catwalk. I, for real? Catwalk, catwalk to rocket slide. Oh, fuck, it's 299.
[2806.55s -> 2819.11s]  Do I need both? I need both. All right, I'll do this quick. That, this is the one that makes the
[2819.11s -> 2823.03s]  most money. I have to do this like a few times. How many times do I have to do this? Get a loan.
[2823.03s -> 2832.01s]  That's not how this works. Um, no, I gotta do, I have to do this one. I have to. Just, I'm gonna do,
[2832.01s -> 2836.49s]  okay. I'm gonna do this for five minutes. No, I'm not. That's way too long. Three minutes. It's
[2836.49s -> 2846.58s]  four minutes. All right, this is the last time you're ever gonna see this. Okay, slow it down,
[2846.58s -> 2853.46s]  slow it down. I got, I got four minutes of the worst content you will ever see on the stream
[2853.46s -> 2859.85s]  is this game. But it's okay because, no, actually, never mind. I take that back. This is the best.
[2867.45s -> 2876.94s]  I just need like three bucks. HML. No, no, no. PSP, HML, lax, ATL. How did I miss that?
[2876.94s -> 2882.98s]  Okay, double, triple, come on. Oh my god, I'm throwing in the wrong one. What an idiot.
[2883.54s -> 2907.24s]  I just need to see what it does. PSP, lax. I'm gonna stay back here. They're easy. Okay, I'm gonna,
[2907.24s -> 2918.79s]  you have to stay all the way to the right so I can see them. That's a dollar. What do I even
[2918.79s -> 2943.18s]  have in my hands? Okay, lax. Atlanta. Uh, Atlanta. Shit. Two hours on this, two hours on this Donald
[2943.18s -> 2955.58s]  fuck garbage. It's been, it's been an hour, but it's been 50 minutes. Just hold on. Just hold on.
[2955.58s -> 2977.29s]  Don't worry. It'll, it'll be worth it. What is PSP? What airport is PSP? Pennsylvania?
[2979.02s -> 2991.32s]  Philadelphia? PlayStation Portable. Yeah, I know. I understand that that's the joke, but what is it
[2991.32s -> 3006.14s]  actually? I definitely have enough for both now. What's going on? I still have a minute and 25
[3006.14s -> 3018.76s]  seconds left in my shift. Oh, he's coming back. Okay, he's wrapping around. PSP, please stop playing.
[3018.76s -> 3027.64s]  Nope, I'm not gonna. Oh, there's only one more.
[3037.22s -> 3043.74s]  You guys, you guys, come on. Let me have, I mean, you gotta let me have some, some time.
[3044.78s -> 3051.54s]  I want to see what the slide looks like in the Donald Duck game. Give me a break. Just because
[3051.54s -> 3057.62s]  I want to sit here and see what it does. And look, every, all, all the people that have been talking
[3057.62s -> 3064.09s]  shit right now. We'll see. We'll see when you see the slide. I guarantee you half the people that
[3064.09s -> 3068.73s]  are like, oh, no, no, get out of here. I'm going to be like, oh, pub champ. When I slide down that
[3068.73s -> 3088.39s]  fucking thing. Oh, I have to work, right? Worth, totally worth. I'm going to see worth, read out,
[3088.39s -> 3104.90s]  just spam like a thousand times. All right. I need, uh, I need hue. I definitely have enough,
[3104.90s -> 3116.15s]  I think. Two seconds. All right. 297. I got three bills now. It's 240 for the
[3117.11s -> 3119.50s]  all right. I definitely have enough. I got five bucks at least.
[3128.34s -> 3131.70s]  Oh, it's do, it's counting the coins up and giving me new denominations.
[3134.46s -> 3144.76s]  All right. I got $5 and 60 cents. I'm ready. And look, everybody else doesn't understand.
[3145.32s -> 3149.56s]  I get to be in the Guinness book of world records for an incredibly specific thing.
[3152.81s -> 3156.81s]  I streamed this for an hour. No one else on earth has ever done that.
[3157.53s -> 3168.20s]  Ever. I get to be in that book. You know, I, I, you know, I'll probably list it in that book,
[3168.20s -> 3175.91s]  like a hundred times. You have $5 catwalk to the rocket slide. Yes. And then the ladder, right?
[3178.04s -> 3189.70s]  Hand walking rope, ship's wheel, trampoline, summer salt bar. Okay. So then I do this and
[3189.70s -> 3199.53s]  get the ladder. Please pay. All right. Just take it. Just take my money already. I got like
[3199.53s -> 3203.29s]  3,400 people here that are just screaming at me to hurry this up. All right. Let's do,
[3204.73s -> 3224.10s]  I'm getting three bucks and give me back one penny. No, uh, please make change. Yes.
[3226.52s -> 3246.01s]  Why is this going so slow? Done. All right. Now we do the ladder. Okay. Let me just make sure.
[3246.57s -> 3249.35s]  Rings ladder to rocket ship.
[3249.35s -> 3273.40s]  Okay. I have to, I just bought the scaffolding. I can't not do this. It's been too long. One minute.
[3273.40s -> 3281.32s]  Go. I just need to throw three packages. Just wait, just hold on. Just bear with me. I just
[3281.32s -> 3298.39s]  need to do, I'm just going to stand here and do JFK only. How many, how many, what do I need?
[3298.39s -> 3313.54s]  It's 2.99, right? I have enough now. JFK, come on. JFK, come on. All right. It's not showing me JFK.
[3313.54s -> 3330.79s]  Throw like an Oak Oak and JFK only. I got enough, right? Yeah. No, I have to. Yeah. I definitely
[3330.79s -> 3338.39s]  have enough. 100%. I'm just going to go in there and just dump all my change on the counter and
[3338.39s -> 3356.79s]  just leave. I don't even care about making change. Oh, it's going to do another dollar. If the rocket,
[3356.79s -> 3365.00s]  if the rocket lifts off and takes off as like a funny cartoon joke, you owe me an apology.
[3366.92s -> 3379.38s]  If I just slide down the slide and that's it, I owe you an apology. We're both in on this.
[3389.83s -> 3400.70s]  Ladder to the rocket ship, 2.95. Let's go. Please pay for your purchases. Give me the dollar.
[3401.58s -> 3409.14s]  Is the dollar, is it implying it's very heavy? Because look at my hand.
[3410.02s -> 3414.34s]  Oh, I got a frog in my throat. All right. That's, I need to 2.95. Dollar,
[3416.30s -> 3433.29s]  125, 150, 175, $2. Okay. 2.25, 250. I'm a fucking old lady paying for an ice cream.
[3435.24s -> 3451.11s]  2.75. Okay. 2.80. 2.90. I'm just sitting there behind her just going like, get a fucking credit
[3451.11s -> 3459.70s]  card. It's not hard. It's very easy. All right. What was it? What? I forgot. 2.95. What am I at?
[3465.96s -> 3489.77s]  You startled me. I don't know. Where? How much is up there? Let's go. I like to pay with exact
[3489.77s -> 3496.57s]  change so the government can't track me. I don't think the government gives a shit that you find a
[3496.57s -> 3517.54s]  large ice cream from Ben and Jerry's. All right. Come on. Buy the boom box. Here we go. This is it.
[3518.89s -> 3525.99s]  Oh, this is going to be awesome. I can't wait. That's straw man propaganda.
[3527.11s -> 3536.17s]  I'm going in. Let's go. It's going to take off. Do it. Take off. This is huge. All right. This
[3536.17s -> 3542.71s]  counts. You thought I was just going to be that top screen. This counts. Oh my God. Why is there
[3542.71s -> 3554.94s]  like a 200 foot? No, no, no, no, no, no. Go back. I wouldn't do this. This is scary. All right. You
[3554.94s -> 3567.11s]  owe me an apology. You owe me an apology. All right. Are you kidding me? He just did a double
[3567.11s -> 3586.68s]  front flip. You owe me an apology. I'm doing it again. The one resident sleeper in there is like
[3586.68s -> 3595.54s]  probably my favorite. I would puke if I was up here. This is not safe. These are children.
[3599.94s -> 3604.52s]  Double front flip. You don't get an apology from me. That's better than the ship taking off.
[3613.58s -> 3626.58s]  Okay. Lame. Lame. So bald. I'm not going to read that. All right. Let me ask you a question.
[3627.61s -> 3632.76s]  If I kept this and turn the volume up all the way and muted my microphone and left the room
[3632.76s -> 3650.98s]  and zoomed in on the box, would the viewers go up or down? Okay. Uh, this next one, I remember
[3650.98s -> 3654.02s]  playing this a long time ago. I don't remember anything about it, but I remember it being a
[3654.02s -> 3670.10s]  thing. Um, shuffle puck cafe. I'm not going to do that. Apologize now. I'm sorry that you feel
[3670.10s -> 3681.90s]  that way. So shuffle puck cafe is a, you fight against other people playing shuffle puck. Of
[3681.90s -> 3689.75s]  course you do. Anyways, uh, I don't know if I want to select my video card game. Is it mouse?
[3690.47s -> 3699.45s]  This game is weird. You know, um, what's that Christopher Robin game where you have to hit
[3699.45s -> 3706.68s]  the baseball and hit a home run Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin baseball, whatever it's called,
[3706.68s -> 3716.79s]  the whole, like whatever it is, it's kind of like that. They progressively just get insanely
[3716.79s -> 3745.40s]  difficult. Okay. Here we go. So, uh, you pick an opponent. Let's pick the pig. This is not,
[3745.40s -> 3754.52s]  this is not a porn game. What are you talking about? Oh my God. That was, is it turned up or
[3754.52s -> 3758.60s]  did I, does it turn down? I think I might've turned it up too high. Should I turn it down?
[3768.02s -> 3778.50s]  It's air hockey. Yeah. Why did I not say air hockey? It's a game where you, you
[3778.50s -> 3787.80s]  shuffle puck again. It's air hockey. As you can tell, it's pretty hard. It's especially,
[3787.80s -> 3795.29s]  it's running at like, my game is running at like 20 frames a second. His game is running at like
[3795.29s -> 3800.58s]  60 frames a second. It's not fair. This is what happens when a PC player plays a console player.
[3800.58s -> 3818.66s]  This is why you can't, the cross-platform don't work. All right. Hold on. I'm going to try
[3818.66s -> 3821.54s]  something, a tactic here. I'm going to try to go into the top right corner every time.
[3826.54s -> 3828.54s]  No. Oh my God. Look, he's lining up a shot.
[3828.54s -> 3845.94s]  It's not as easy as it looks. It's look, look at the frames. Come on. Like give me a break.
[3845.94s -> 3855.10s]  It's not frame perfect. Like you think it is. Go back to, no, this is not one of the hard ones.
[3855.10s -> 3865.30s]  Hold on. I'm just going to, I think, I think the pig is hard. How many points does it take
[3865.30s -> 3883.42s]  for me to get embarrassed? I wonder. Okay. Hold on. Oh, I'm using that technique. If I have like
[3883.42s -> 3899.91s]  10 frames a second, then I can fill the whole board with a giant paddle. Why are we playing
[3899.91s -> 3923.24s]  to 15? We shouldn't be playing to 15. That's what makes no sense. I know it's just let it fall in.
[3923.88s -> 3927.56s]  Just do it. Just get it. Do it. Do it. I'm going to play the easy one.
[3928.12s -> 3936.68s]  And this game was so much fun though. It read at so much better frame rate in my brain.
[3936.68s -> 3953.78s]  When I played it, I played this on an original Mac. All right. I lost. Game. Wait. Define keys.
[3953.78s -> 3987.06s]  Champions. Biff raunch is 15 and 14. Okay. Paddle. No, I can't lose. Somebody said, okay.
[3993.00s -> 4000.26s]  I don't think this is regulation. He's got a chalkboard eraser and I have an entire lane
[4000.82s -> 4026.50s]  of bowling bumpers. See, he's easy though. Look at this. Watch how slow. I'm just going to show
[4026.50s -> 4032.39s]  you. Watch how slow he does this. See that the pig was hard. It was a hard one. All right. I'm
[4032.39s -> 4036.33s]  going to, I can drop the, all right. I'm going to, I'm going to put it down to a smaller. Look at
[4036.33s -> 4045.62s]  that. That's so much easier. I hold on. How do I, can I like, there we go. All right. Paddle size.
[4046.42s -> 4056.78s]  Let's put it back to normal. It was a 20. All right. I will beat you. Locker, no blocker,
[4056.78s -> 4064.33s]  small blocker, custom blocker, whatever that means. All right. Here we go. All right. Let's go. Yeah.
[4064.33s -> 4070.38s]  He's absolutely stupid. Like I will win no matter what. I have to give myself a,
[4071.86s -> 4081.10s]  no. Look at, see, I went right to the hardest thing in the game. That was my problem. Make it
[4081.10s -> 4098.36s]  one or you're a fake gamer. I don't think you can even do that. I'm going to win. This is embarrassing.
[4102.54s -> 4118.06s]  No, new opponent. This is just, this is, this is a hustle. No, it's not. Chalk eraser versus a piece
[4118.06s -> 4129.46s]  of chalk. I wonder if I do it really hard. If it'll break through his hologram shield. Do it.
[4133.88s -> 4139.61s]  You're going to make them cry. No, new opponent. This is like, this is embarrassing for you. I
[4139.61s -> 4146.92s]  don't want to just have you lose by this much. Let's do, let's go back to 20 and new opponent.
[4147.64s -> 4150.92s]  I know there's a, I think the robot is the hardest thing in the whole game.
[4150.92s -> 4167.59s]  I think the robot's actually impossible. So let's see. Why was the pig so hard? The robot is always
[4167.59s -> 4178.41s]  the hardest one. This guy's the champion. Did I do something? Did I change a setting? Why was the
[4178.41s -> 4186.25s]  pig so unbearable? But the robot's not. I swear I have this memory of it being like around the edges.
[4186.81s -> 4201.94s]  I must have fucked something up. You just sucked when you last played. No, no way.
[4201.94s -> 4214.22s]  No way. New opponent. Look, here he is. I didn't just suck when I last played. I'm sorry guys.
[4214.22s -> 4229.98s]  That's not the case. His cursor is actually teleporting. See if I can beat him though. I'll
[4229.98s -> 4260.92s]  try. Jesus. Ooh, it's going to be close. I'll do it. I can do it. Boomer versus a zoomer.
[4260.92s -> 4269.14s]  I'm an idiot. Why does everybody have to be a boomer and everybody have to be a zoomer?
[4274.33s -> 4288.70s]  And I don't even know which one is who in that scenario. Why is it always going to be about
[4288.70s -> 4306.94s]  boomer? Seriously, don't ask me how actual 12 year old me was able to do this. Nice. All right,
[4306.94s -> 4319.27s]  I got the advantage. This is the champion, right? It's because you probably used a bigger paddle.
[4319.27s -> 4344.95s]  You know, I probably did. I'm trying to sneak it into the corner. I'm still in game. All right,
[4344.95s -> 4352.81s]  I'm going to wait till his cursor is on the left and then go. I'm trying to do a tennis strategy.
[4352.81s -> 4371.11s]  It's not really working. He doesn't know about the second form. They don't evolve. Hey, I say
[4371.11s -> 4375.03s]  that's what happens when I look over a chat. If I was in a tournament and we were about to start,
[4375.03s -> 4380.07s]  I wouldn't look over at the audience and go, what did somebody just say? No, I would play. Let's go.
[4385.42s -> 4390.78s]  No professional athlete in the world like a baseball player doesn't get up to the batter's
[4390.78s -> 4395.02s]  box with the bat in his hand, step into the plate and right before the pitcher starts to pitch
[4395.74s -> 4399.98s]  turns around and like asks a question to the fucking people in the stands behind him.
[4399.98s -> 4436.28s]  No, he just focuses and he plays the damn game. I was imagining a baseball player is standing
[4436.28s -> 4442.79s]  in the batter's box and he's responding to somebody that's behind him calling him bald.
[4442.79s -> 4456.57s]  Or this looks like looks like Jay Albertson at the plate here seems to be arguing with somebody
[4456.57s -> 4462.65s]  behind home plate, the home plate baseball. That was a ball, but it looks like they're screaming.
[4462.65s -> 4466.89s]  He's pointing at his head saying it's I'm not. I'm not. I'm not sure what he's talking about here,
[4466.89s -> 4471.26s]  Frank. What does that mean? No, he took the helmet off. He took the helmet off. He's pointing his
[4471.26s -> 4479.50s]  hair. He's getting loud now. He's been ejected from the game. This is the only fucking platform
[4479.50s -> 4500.26s]  where this happens. All right. I got, I got some more. What about a comedy show? Yeah, but
[4501.40s -> 4508.79s]  you're not like a professional comedy athlete. A comedian doesn't go on stage and open up shuffle
[4508.79s -> 4536.28s]  puck and play it with his back to the audience. All right. I can still do it. Come on. Three more.
[4536.28s -> 4550.46s]  Well, why wouldn't you? I don't know. I'm not supposed to be looking over here. All right.
[4550.46s -> 4580.57s]  Tied it up. Two more and I beat this guy. One more. Here we go. Oh,
[4580.57s -> 4597.94s]  no. Give me the ball. Give me the puck. Give me the puck. You lose. Hey, take those shoulders
[4597.94s -> 4622.36s]  back to Alderman. You fucking idiot. Who's next? I think this is the hard one. This guy's only
[4622.36s -> 4642.65s]  playing with one hand. He's like drinking. So am I, but I'm drinking coffee. That's the difference.
[4642.65s -> 4665.02s]  You can do it. Who plays air hockey with two hands? Oh yeah. It's not a Ouija board.
[4671.67s -> 4686.41s]  So who's the hardest person in here? It's definitely not you. You don't have enough power.
[4686.41s -> 4691.77s]  All right. That was, I had insane amount of spin on that. Look at this. He's all defense. He has
[4691.77s -> 4712.84s]  no offense. I'm just gonna walk away from the table. What about who's under here? Oh, he put
[4712.84s -> 4734.55s]  his hand up. Yeah, you're real bad. Not even up to a challenge. It's not even worth, it's not worth
[4734.55s -> 4742.92s]  my time. It's not. I'm sorry. Hey, thanks for playing. I'm way, way higher on like the tier list
[4742.92s -> 4747.90s]  than you, but I could make you feel happy. You want me to make you like feel better?
[4747.90s -> 4777.00s]  Oops. Okay. There you go. You got a point. Good work. You, yeah. Do not Disney movie me. I'm not
[4777.00s -> 4799.10s]  gonna let that happen. I'm out. Here we go. Is her paddle smaller? Why does she have a smaller paddle?
[4799.10s -> 4827.74s]  The hell was that? Uh, so that's cheating. So you, that you cheated. I don't get to do that.
[4827.74s -> 4843.70s]  Okay. That's an automatic disqualification. Ah, the role play gets harder when you beat him enough.
[4843.70s -> 4857.83s]  I know this one character in this game that you have magic powers. That's really cool. Actually,
[4857.83s -> 4866.63s]  that's really cool. Who's anybody in the back? What about, what was that? What was this little guy?
[4869.72s -> 4883.75s]  Is this the guy? Is the little Yoda guy? That's impossible. This is me. This is me. I did the
[4883.75s -> 4913.24s]  same thing. This is me. That's weird. I did this like fucking 25 minutes ago. Same tactic. I can't
[4913.24s -> 4934.26s]  fucking believe it. And he's going to lose with one point. That's unbelievable. All right. Who's
[4934.26s -> 4947.75s]  the last character? Who's this? Uh, looks like a beer. All right. Well, I didn't know you're
[4947.75s -> 4961.48s]  going to do that. Sorry. I beat the hardest. I beat the one up. I beat the champion. Maybe not.
[4961.48s -> 4997.99s]  He does this little wind up. Oh man. Is it bad? Uh, is this Biff? I got to score at least one
[4997.99s -> 5010.25s]  point on Biff right in the corner. I might, I might be able to do it. It's, it's really possible.
[5010.25s -> 5068.07s]  That was so fast. You can't even see it. Ah, shit. That technique doesn't work. Stop doing it. Oh,
[5068.07s -> 5076.63s]  I'm going to lose. I'm just realizing that this, yeah, there's not very much safety here.
[5076.63s -> 5085.05s]  Imagine playing, um, air hockey with somebody without the barrier in front of you. You would
[5085.05s -> 5093.05s]  get so hurt. I actually broke my finger before playing air hockey when I was younger. I had those
[5093.13s -> 5096.17s]  friends and you know, some of you guys have them because when you play air hockey,
[5096.17s -> 5100.33s]  there's this unwritten agreement that you're not going to fucking murder each other.
[5101.13s -> 5106.09s]  Nobody wants to go as hard as they can. Crack, crack, crack. You have an unwritten rule that
[5106.09s -> 5109.85s]  you're just going to play and no one's going to really go as hard as they can. See, my friends
[5109.85s -> 5114.41s]  didn't do that. Friends of mine would try to go as hard as they can. And what would end up happening
[5114.41s -> 5121.29s]  is it would hit the sides and bounce up and it was not cool. And sometimes they would do it too
[5121.29s -> 5127.29s]  hard and it would hit the sides, bounce up and like, like kind of like go by. And you'd be like,
[5127.29s -> 5134.68s]  stop that bullshit. Let's stop that. Well, one of those times it bounced up, caught me right in the
[5134.68s -> 5142.57s]  finger. And then we all got grounded. I, why did I get grounded? I have nothing to do with it.
[5153.86s -> 5164.66s]  Fuck. He's going to embarrass me. Did this happen last week? No, it happened when I was like 14.
[5165.46s -> 5175.32s]  They need to make these things out of like a squishy material nowadays. Do they still make
[5175.32s -> 5184.23s]  these things in a hard plastic? You know, many times I've been in an arcade and you just hear
[5186.47s -> 5192.46s]  you look behind you and that thing is on its edge rolling down. It's like easy guys.
[5193.18s -> 5210.33s]  Oh, you should have to wear like a big heavy glove. Yeah. Before you play this game,
[5210.33s -> 5214.94s]  you should have to put on, it will not activate unless you put on this big, heavy fucking gauntlet
[5214.94s -> 5223.66s]  that's like like 20 pounds. So you can't do it hard. I think I saw all the opponents, right?
[5227.21s -> 5239.27s]  Yeah. This is the guy's the hardest. So I think we saw everybody. Unless there's somebody down here.
[5240.66s -> 5248.76s]  No, this is just Martini guy. Play the robot. You want us to beat the robot badly and see what he
[5248.76s -> 5258.41s]  does? Robot, robot. All right. I'll beat the robot and then look, he's, he's very easy.
[5266.01s -> 5276.89s]  There's a droid setting. Anybody else do this when you play air hockey with somebody?
[5279.06s -> 5282.10s]  I don't like air hockey. I don't because it's a lot of money.
[5282.66s -> 5289.54s]  Usually it's like a $1.50. It's usually one to $2 to play it. And usually the other person is
[5289.54s -> 5294.50s]  way more excited to play than you are. And you have to deal with instead of Oh, I really want
[5294.50s -> 5298.82s]  to go play time crisis. That sounds like a lot of fun. Now you have to block out the next like
[5298.82s -> 5305.93s]  30 straight minutes to pretend to enjoy playing air hockey. You can't leave the table. It's to
[5305.93s -> 5310.65s]  say somebody Oh, you know, you scored one and I scored one. And then Oh, you missed. Oh, wait,
[5310.65s -> 5316.09s]  this is nice. Nice like volley we've got going here. It lasts for like 20 to 30 minutes.
[5318.25s -> 5323.61s]  And the table keeps producing air out of the holes until somebody wins. So you can't just leave.
[5325.69s -> 5332.01s]  Nobody wants to take over your game for you because they want to do their own. But usually
[5332.01s -> 5337.93s]  this one just dominant person. That's the one that they want to play there that you're that I want
[5337.93s -> 5345.59s]  to let's do air hockey. Yeah. You just don't give a shit. Now I've been the air hockey enthusiast
[5345.59s -> 5362.41s]  before. But there's never really a time when both people are incredibly enthusiastic about it.
[5362.41s -> 5367.21s]  Sometimes it's even both are very not enthusiastic about it. You walk around the arcade four times.
[5368.46s -> 5376.14s]  Oh, you even play air hockey, I guess. And then you both lazily play it. And neither one of you
[5376.14s -> 5407.59s]  has any fun. I have fun. Maybe you shouldn't go to the arcade. We had an air air hockey table when I
[5407.59s -> 5412.62s]  was kid, but friends of mine did the exact thing you're describing. And I didn't I was afraid to
[5412.62s -> 5424.42s]  play it because I didn't want to break my finger. Yeah. And something else too. I'll tell you another
[5424.42s -> 5431.82s]  thing. I don't I don't like the loud noises it makes. Is that am I weird? Anytime somebody gets
[5431.82s -> 5437.66s]  like into back, back, back, back, back. It's like it's I don't like it. It's really fucking loud.
[5437.66s -> 5443.96s]  It's like freaking me out. When you see your friend like queue up for like a big hit and you're like,
[5443.96s -> 5450.79s]  don't do it, please don't do it, please. And they go, boom. It's like, oh, I don't want that. All
[5450.79s -> 5468.38s]  right. So we'll just do it again. Droid. Oh, oh, no, I'm turning. I'm turning him into that friend.
[5479.78s -> 5496.76s]  This is gonna crash my computer. Speed. I'm gonna break my finger. All right, serve.
[5498.30s -> 5520.07s]  I'm gonna sneeze it. I'm really sorry. I'm fine. Okay, let's go. Okay. Have I did I make it
[5520.07s -> 5543.22s]  unbeatable? I didn't make it unbeatable. I can do this. It's not unbeatable. If I score one point,
[5543.22s -> 5561.00s]  if I score one point, I deserve an apology. He bounces off the edges way too fast from his
[5561.00s -> 5575.77s]  serve. Remember I told you Winnie the Pooh home run derby? That's why I said that. Make my paddle
[5575.77s -> 5600.38s]  80. No, I can't. I gotta do it legit. What was that little pause? I don't think I'll ever score.
[5600.38s -> 5623.00s]  He's at 200. No apologies. That's all right. That's okay. Not gonna move. I have to apologize to you.
[5623.00s -> 5655.35s]  Yeah, okay. That's fair. I thought I had it right there. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. It's my
[5655.35s -> 5670.09s]  fault. And that is Shufflepuck. The weird part about Shufflepuck is I used to sit here for hours
[5670.09s -> 5683.05s]  and play this. And I've kind of done everything you can do in this game in 25 minutes. Wait a
[5683.05s -> 5713.94s]  minute. Hold on. Death is here. Secret character. Is there somebody under the robe? Eat that. Do
[5713.94s -> 5722.44s]  Max paddle? No, I don't think I need that. No, it's not death. It's just some kids doing the
[5722.44s -> 5742.31s]  trench coat trick to get into the bar. Because they're not 21. I got one point. That's all I care
[5742.31s -> 5753.99s]  about. Let me get one more point. Last one. No, I quit. Lost to kids? No, I'm sorry. That rephrase
[5753.99s -> 5777.61s]  that. Lost to three kids. All right. That's it. Let's do the next one. Which one? I knew I wanted
[5777.61s -> 5780.49s]  to play this and I knew I wanted to play Donald Duck. I have one or two more that I thought were
[5780.49s -> 5791.51s]  interesting. Which is it? Yeah, I know. I already like leaked them. I leaked them out already because
[5791.51s -> 5802.20s]  you saw the top of the browser. Dino Park Tycoon is the next one. It's already been leaked. Can
[5802.20s -> 5806.76s]  we vote on the games? Yes. But I wanted to do these first because they looked the most interesting to
[5806.76s -> 5813.24s]  me because I saw them pop up randomly. So I wanted to try them. This is Dino Park Tycoon.
[5817.59s -> 5829.66s]  It's very possible that I may or may not sit here for another four hours. I don't know. Okay, new
[5829.66s -> 5838.12s]  game. The bank has approved a business loan of $5,000. Payments will be made monthly. Remember
[5838.12s -> 5844.50s]  that you have to buy land, fencing, dinosaurs, and food. Good luck on your venture. Thank you.
[5847.16s -> 5855.29s]  Buy land at the real estate office. Dino Diner. Dino City Big Big Sale. Otherwise,
[5857.85s -> 5864.44s]  dinosaurs are people, but they also put people in the parks. Is that what I'm understanding here?
[5868.46s -> 5880.65s]  So that's weird. Okay, let's go buy real estate. VA, HA, FHA approved. Okay, so we can do
[5881.62s -> 5888.66s]  the desert, plains, or the marsh. Peaceful and remote, dry, hot, and flat. 500 bucks an acre.
[5889.38s -> 5893.80s]  The plains is mild weather, fertile land, close to towns, a thousand dollars per acre.
[5894.52s -> 5901.80s]  Or the marsh. Wet, swampy, plants, and reptiles really love it. I think I have to do desert. This
[5901.80s -> 5916.12s]  is the first try. That's cute. What a cute game. All right, so buy. Select a plot of land to
[5916.12s -> 5933.08s]  purchase. Front gate is here. Public restrooms. Office food? Foods. This one? Sold. How much money
[5933.08s -> 5946.26s]  should I spend? Food? All right, all of it. No, I only have four grand. I'm not going to buy it all.
[5947.30s -> 5954.34s]  This is good for now. What about one place in the office? All right, I'm going to do one
[5954.34s -> 5962.26s]  office. Restrooms are included, aren't they? All right, that's good. Okay, I got food, one extra
[5962.26s -> 5971.56s]  little part of the park, and then an office space here. The other money I can spend on dinosaurs.
[5974.76s -> 5982.36s]  Buy fencing at the general store. Order form. All right, you can find it all in the general store
[5982.36s -> 5995.00s]  catalog. Fences. Wood. Thousand dollars a pen. Cement wall or electricity. This wood fence,
[5995.00s -> 6011.51s]  wood keeps in dinosaurs? Which one's the cheapest? Let's do wood. Oh, shit. Okay,
[6011.51s -> 6023.61s]  I'm going to put it over here. Should I do it on all of them? Do I need a fence around the office?
[6024.41s -> 6039.46s]  I don't need a fence around the office. That's going to be fine. All right, that's done.
[6042.15s -> 6053.70s]  Hire an employee here. I'm almost out of money. 1,400 bucks a month? I don't have any,
[6054.26s -> 6062.44s]  I have no money. Maintenance, concession, security, tour guide, management?
[6065.14s -> 6077.08s]  Maintenance? Uh, did you just put that in his nose? Maintenance. Holy shit, he's ripping off
[6077.08s -> 6083.94s]  his nose. That's a fake nose. His real nose is underneath. I don't know why, why does he want
[6083.94s -> 6108.66s]  to make his nose bigger? I'm not going to be able to afford a dinosaur. Don't hire anybody. Hold on.
[6109.54s -> 6119.98s]  One maintenance worker. I'm going to need it. Buy a dinosaur at Dino City. Albertosaurus,
[6121.42s -> 6134.97s]  Ankylosaurus, Colophysis, Dino-niches, Edmontosaurus, Allosaurus, Corythosaurus.
[6135.61s -> 6145.62s]  These are too expensive. Um, I can only afford a Coli-physis or a Dionysus. Diono-chis,
[6147.98s -> 6170.17s]  Dionysus, Colo-cholophysis. All right, let's do a Dino. Is it Dino-niches? Dino-niches?
[6171.05s -> 6186.54s]  Dino-niches? All right, I'm going to do Dino. Get it. Buy it. What do I do with the egg? I have
[6186.54s -> 6200.42s]  250. It's already hatched. Okay. Oh, okay. Put it over here. One Dino. Cool. Now what do I do?
[6200.42s -> 6211.13s]  Buy food for the dinosaur. What does he eat? I don't know what this dinosaur eats. Somebody
[6211.13s -> 6237.93s]  look it up. Type in, is a Dio-niches a herbivore? Is it meat? $25 a unit. Get out of here. All right,
[6237.93s -> 6252.04s]  nobody move. Small feeder. I guess I'm just, it's, let's do two, three, four units. How much is too
[6252.04s -> 6260.47s]  much? Set an admission. Oh, here we go. Let's make the money back. Admission prices. Business,
[6260.47s -> 6271.64s]  business is bought and sold. Tickets. Nobody is coming to the park. Uh, what? General ledger,
[6271.64s -> 6281.93s]  inventory, visits, food, gifts, staff, profit, loss. How do I do this? Check profit statement.
[6281.93s -> 6300.31s]  Where's, where's like a guy bank? Current balance. Snacks? So I can't set these? Am I missing
[6300.31s -> 6310.74s]  something here? Set the price of the park. You have one Dino and two unused pens. Yeah, tickets,
[6310.74s -> 6317.96s]  but it says nobody is coming to the park. No, I don't want to sell the park. You have no
[6317.96s -> 6346.70s]  concessions to sell food. Get a loan. Uh, did I do it? Dino, diner, land, general store employment,
[6350.15s -> 6360.23s]  staff. Okay. Some more tour guides might be nice. You have four units of meat. You have one. How
[6360.23s -> 6375.34s]  do I set the park? Is it, it's not, is it just free? Set admission prices in here. Visits? Oh,
[6375.34s -> 6383.61s]  okay. Hold on. Ticket prices for winter. That's fine. Spring. It's going to be more summer. Way
[6383.61s -> 6399.80s]  more fall as it can be for this is prime season here. All right. That looks good. Select the park
[6399.80s -> 6418.57s]  icon to start. I'm ready to go. Here we go. Is that the dinosaur? Why is he doing a fighting game
[6418.57s -> 6442.23s]  entrance? Meat. He does one unit of meat a week. Oh, I'm making money rapidly. All right. Where's
[6442.23s -> 6451.90s]  the other pens? This place sucks. This place is terrible. There's a dug hole with water port in
[6451.90s -> 6468.94s]  it. It's one dinosaur. There's no paths. I like the song though. All right. Let me get another,
[6468.94s -> 6482.20s]  let me get another dinosaur. Cops are here. 4,000? All right. Buy food with dinosaur. How many days
[6482.20s -> 6494.04s]  has it been? No, I want another dinosaur. I want an expensive one, a nice one. There's more. Where's
[6494.04s -> 6502.10s]  the T-Rex? T-Rex 9750. That's what I want. I have a wait until then. I need a tour guide.
[6503.18s -> 6511.75s]  Your dinosaur is going hungry. Buy food. What? Just get this shit out of me.
[6512.79s -> 6530.94s]  Should I do a medium unit? Okay. I need a tour guide. Tour guide 900 bucks a month.
[6532.70s -> 6545.90s]  That's right. Okay. The tour guide for my one dinosaur in my pool. All right. I want some more.
[6545.90s -> 6562.04s]  Let me get a T-Rex in here. Is he getting bigger? I'm real. I just hired that person 900 bucks a
[6562.04s -> 6571.40s]  month to just be standing here pointing this way, which effectively a wooden sign could do.
[6572.62s -> 6579.61s]  A wooden sign that says Dionosaurus with a blurb about what the dinosaur is could be right here
[6579.61s -> 6592.70s]  with the arrow pointing that way. End of winter quarter. Why am I losing money? Oh, right, right,
[6592.70s -> 6606.73s]  right. Auction today? For what? Next up we have an Ankylosaurus. Can we have a starting bid at
[6606.73s -> 6614.66s]  3,000? We've got 3,000. The guy with the straw hat. Can I get 3,100? 3,300. Is that a good look
[6614.66s -> 6625.48s]  it up? What kind of is it? Is it a good dinosaur? Five and a half, five and a half, five and a half,
[6625.48s -> 6637.48s]  five and a half. I'm gonna bid Mickey Mouse. This is this animal kingdom. This is where it started.
[6637.48s -> 6639.56s]  This is so much money. 5,000?
[6643.64s -> 6655.38s]  It's me, right? Did I overpay? 48.50? Is that too much? What should I? All right, go over here.
[6659.72s -> 6692.90s]  Next up we have... I blew all my money. A lot of five and a halfs. Sounds like a washing machine.
[6699.16s -> 6707.16s]  That's really good. He sounds like... Hey, I'll bid on this one! Juan De Baron, South American
[6707.16s -> 6732.33s]  rancher and animal trainer. Tours dinosaur troop worldwide. Headlines Las Vegas. Bid. All right,
[6732.33s -> 6744.36s]  no more, no more, no more. 2,100 is my last... I'm up. I'm not going higher than 23. No, you guys
[6744.36s -> 6781.11s]  are paying too much. No one's bidding. It said Bernie is bidding big. I've gotta have that
[6781.11s -> 6800.60s]  dinosaur. It's really important that I get that home with me. I'm just gonna leave. What the...
[6800.68s -> 6810.06s]  I'm just standing here. Wait, let me see. Friz Farflung, genetic research engineer working on
[6810.06s -> 6819.00s]  secret government project dealing with dinosaur relativity. I don't have five and a half. I have
[6819.00s -> 6830.41s]  two and a six. All right, let's go. Holy shit, that thing is sick. What does it eat? Vegetarian.

[6857.67s -> 6865.90s]  Do I get 12 of like the high quality food? And then I need to get a little bit... hold on. How
[6865.90s -> 6872.63s]  much was that dinosaur if I bought it in real life? Well, I mean, if I bought it from here.
[6873.19s -> 6883.29s]  Was it called an ankylosaurus? I got a pretty good deal. I paid almost a thousand dollars less.
[6884.01s -> 6893.93s]  A tour guide quit. I mean, lack of payment. You may not have enough money to pay your bills at the
[6893.93s -> 6904.01s]  end of the month. Go to the bank if you need a loan. Uh, a maintenance per... there are no employees
[6904.01s -> 6921.08s]  here to feed the dinosaurs. Uh, why is everybody gone? Hire an employee... hold on a second. Wait,
[6921.08s -> 6924.60s]  wait, wait, wait. Just hold on. You do not have the money for your loan payment this month. The
[6924.60s -> 6932.92s]  bank is foreclosed on your park. Better luck next time. I didn't even get a second. What? I had
[6932.92s -> 6954.36s]  nine thousand dollars. It told you everybody quit and then you opened the park. Oh, I did...
[6957.75s -> 6962.47s]  one more time. One more, one more, one more. I know I got it. I know what to do now.
[6965.30s -> 6973.46s]  This time, I'm gonna buy one. We're gonna go to the marsh. I'm gonna buy an office space here
[6973.46s -> 6981.86s]  and I'm gonna buy one here. I'm gonna buy two. Okay, don't let this distract you from the fact
[6981.86s -> 6987.77s]  that Jerma sneezed into his hands. Would you rather me open up my pants and sneeze down
[6987.77s -> 7003.82s]  into my underwear? What are you talking about? I need fences, wood. I'm gonna go right here and
[7003.82s -> 7008.36s]  right here. Two dinosaur enclosures. I'm already out of money. How? I'm going right to the bank.
[7008.92s -> 7016.52s]  What did I do that was different? Hire an employee here. No, no, no, not yet. Where's the... I need
[7016.52s -> 7028.47s]  the bank. Okay, I need, uh, I need to borrow some money. Sorry, your credit limit has been reached.
[7030.92s -> 7041.26s]  What? That's a dog shit interest rate too. You should be ashamed of yourself.
[7044.63s -> 7060.04s]  Hold on. What am I supposed to do? All right, I'm only supposed to have one enclosure.
[7062.82s -> 7072.46s]  I have an idea. Okay, just bear with me for a second. Just bear with me for one second.
[7072.46s -> 7090.01s]  I'm gonna make it really expensive. Not that expensive though. That's too much. That's the
[7090.01s -> 7094.25s]  roller coaster tycoon with the little AI walks up to the line and immediately turns away.
[7096.17s -> 7105.91s]  No, we're gonna make it expensive. And I don't have enough for an employee. I have enough for
[7105.91s -> 7137.11s]  a dinosaur, don't I? I don't even have enough for a dinosaur. New plan. Cheapest place. That
[7137.11s -> 7144.30s]  was not the cheapest place. That's why. Fuck. Okay, it's all right. Just one spot and a spot
[7144.30s -> 7153.30s]  for the office. Done. We're gonna fence in that one spot and I'm gonna buy it, uh, uh, somebody.
[7154.74s -> 7161.48s]  Wood? No, no, no, no. He's everyone's like, no, no. Why, why, what happened? What do you mean no?
[7161.48s -> 7165.88s]  I'll be fine. This time I'm not gonna do it. Um, look, I'm gonna, everything's gonna be fine.
[7165.88s -> 7188.98s]  Just wait. I just need a tour guide. Higher. Okay. Done. 2,500. I'm gonna buy a cheap dinosaur.
[7188.98s -> 7197.40s]  Let's go with a, uh, a pentaceratops. That's not, that's not as more expensive. That's okay,
[7197.40s -> 7219.03s]  though. No, how about an ornithomimus? Yeah. Right here. Ornithomimus is in there now. I have an
[7219.03s -> 7222.39s]  employee. Now I just gotta get food and I'm gonna jack the prices up like crazy and I'm not gonna
[7222.39s -> 7246.84s]  spend money. So an ornithomimus eats what exactly? Meats and plants. What's cheaper? 12 bucks or 25
[7246.84s -> 7259.32s]  bucks a unit. What about seeds? A dollar a unit. That's cheap. You look it up. What, what, what
[7259.32s -> 7279.14s]  shit over here? Oh, I'm crushing the bugs. Okay. I get it. Does it eat plants? I didn't look. Can
[7279.14s -> 7291.90s]  I just like scrape this off and put it on toast and feed it to him? I'm gonna look it up. Office.
[7291.90s -> 7305.69s]  Okay. Dinosaurs, right? Where's my guide to dinosaurs? Types of dinosaurs. There it is.
[7307.40s -> 7315.98s]  Occasionally bipedal and ranged in size from a dog to an elephant. Now that's not it. Where is it?
[7323.30s -> 7335.02s]  Ornith, ornithor, ornithomimus. What does it eat? A guide to dinosaurs through the ages.
[7335.10s -> 7340.20s]  Types of dinosaurs. Theories about dinosaurs. Okay, here we go. Ornithor, ornithomimus.
[7341.64s -> 7360.62s]  Vegetarian eats two units a week. You got it. Let's jack the prices up. Not that much. Six,
[7360.62s -> 7368.55s]  six fifties. Fine. Seven in the summer. All right. Two units of vegetables a week.
[7370.36s -> 7383.29s]  We have a tour guide. We're gonna do small feeders. I'll buy 10 units. Fuck, that was me.
[7383.29s -> 7397.18s]  That was me. That's it. That was ha ha ha. At least I own it. Open the park. Let's go.
[7397.18s -> 7420.71s]  Here we go. Come on. Where are all the people? Oh boy. Seven dollars to see a single stupid
[7420.71s -> 7441.40s]  dinosaur nobody's ever heard of. What's wrong with that? This dinosaur is cool. Why do you
[7441.40s -> 7461.94s]  have such a problem with this dinosaur? I think he's cool. Although I need more people. Spend
[7461.94s -> 7485.69s]  money on your dinosaur is going hungry. Okay, now I'm gonna let's go to the I have two spots,
[7486.63s -> 7497.67s]  right? Should I get another employee? No, I need to build up money first. Maybe I should get another
[7497.67s -> 7506.18s]  small dot. Maybe I should get two of them. They get along in the same pan. I put I put them in
[7506.18s -> 7522.22s]  the same pen, right? I gotta lower the prices. You're right. It's too expensive. You're right.
[7522.22s -> 7527.13s]  You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Drop prices. Oh, people are not happy.
[7527.13s -> 7541.10s]  Drop it. Five. 450. All right. That should help. There we go. Load up. End of winter quarter.
[7541.10s -> 7547.98s]  I'm not gonna click it. I'm not gonna click it. It'll screw everything up. All right. I need more
[7547.98s -> 7559.06s]  dino food. How many units I got? Plenty. Let's get some more high quality food in here. All right.
[7559.62s -> 7570.39s]  Good. How do I? I got it. I have a pen. I have a second pen. I need a meat eater. Which one of
[7570.39s -> 7580.81s]  these eats meat? Does the pentaceratops eat meat? Because I have 10 of them. Who eats meat here?
[7581.96s -> 7595.54s]  Me. I do. How about the iguanodon? No. I have to go look it up. Vegetarian. Vegetarian.
[7596.26s -> 7602.82s]  Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Vegetarian.
[7603.62s -> 7612.71s]  Meat. No. I already had you. Vegetarian. Meat. No. Vegetarian. Vegetarian.
[7614.23s -> 7617.91s]  The allosaurus is two units of meat a week. I want an allosaurus.
[7619.54s -> 7628.20s]  No. Climate is wrong. I need a wetlands dinosaur. What's the cotton candy one? That's
[7628.20s -> 7639.11s]  the tyrannosaurus? Okay. No. That's splatoon dinosaur. He was just underground sliding around
[7639.11s -> 7655.91s]  in splatoon. Uh. Vegetarian. Vegetarian. Marsh. Here we go. Does nobody from the marsh eat meat?
[7657.22s -> 7669.03s]  Desert. Desert. Marsh. Vegetarian. Marsh. Vegetarian. Come on. Really? You gotta be
[7669.03s -> 7677.05s]  kidding me. None of... I have to just get another... whatever. I'm just gonna get another
[7678.57s -> 7688.89s]  dinosaurus. Whatever the hell it is. Or an allosaurus. How much money do I have?
[7688.89s -> 7711.75s]  I'm doing it. There's no pen here. I need to get a pen. Please don't come out of the pen.
[7731.21s -> 7737.82s]  Stop. I know. I know. But how do I put the fence on? No. No. No. Back up. Back up. Quick. Quick. Feed

[7756.70s -> 7771.90s]  God damn. All right. Will this... I can't even buy another one of these. This thing eats meat.
[7771.90s -> 7780.39s]  Just give it to me. That's the one I had last game. Hire people? Not yet. I'll blow all my money. I
[7780.39s -> 7788.33s]  need to wait till I have over like 10-15 grand. We're good. Okay. I got two dinosaurs now. How
[7788.33s -> 7797.30s]  much meat do I have? Pay the loan. Pay the loan. Pay the loan. Pay the loan. Current loan amount.
[7797.30s -> 7805.48s]  Pay off. Monthly payment. I'm doing fine. I don't need to do that. I'm fine. I'm doing a monthly
[7805.48s -> 7818.95s]  payment. All right. Now I need to go to food. Make sure I have enough food. I'm almost out of food.
[7821.38s -> 7831.82s]  Let's do like 20. Let's just get a bunch. 30. All right. End of spring quarter. I got 10 grand.
[7833.40s -> 7841.88s]  I'm gonna hire some people. Management. That's very expensive. Concessions. Tour guide. Maintenance.
[7842.52s -> 7848.50s]  Let's get a veterinarian. I thought she just crunched into that egg. Like bit into it.
[7848.50s -> 7858.73s]  All right. We have a veterinarian now. 2,700 bucks a month. I have a tour guide. I'm gonna do
[7858.73s -> 7869.75s]  a concessions chef. 3,800 bucks a month. All right. Slow down. Maintenance. I already have maintenance
[7869.75s -> 7883.05s]  guide, don't I? All right. This is half my money. I can't do anything else. I bought so much food.
[7884.12s -> 7907.30s]  Who's going hungry? What? We're good. I need another pen. General store.
[7908.42s -> 7919.51s]  Should I get another pen? General store. Concessions. Food stand. Sell treats like dino dogs.
[7919.51s -> 7930.04s]  Wait. We're eating them. Restrooms. Get them up there. Buy them. A gift stand.
[7930.12s -> 7941.32s]  Parking lot. Food stand. That's 5,000. I can't do it. I have a chef who's just walking around in
[7941.32s -> 7947.91s]  a chef costume. He's not doing anything. I handed him a broom and I was like, can you sweep up a
[7947.91s -> 7970.39s]  little? I'm doing it. Fuck it. All right. Do I have food here? Is it there? Okay. I think I'm good.
[7972.81s -> 7979.06s]  Uh oh. Bleeding money. Bleeding money. What do I do? I have to fire somebody. Fire the chef.
[7979.06s -> 8001.46s]  Where's the other pen? Wait. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no. Go back, back, back. Who is starving?
[8003.19s -> 8020.97s]  I am bleeding money. Bushes and trees. Buy a worker. I have like 10 workers. No, no, no, no, no,
[8020.97s -> 8037.51s]  less, less, less, less. End of the summer quarter. Let's put those ticket prices up or down. I need
[8037.51s -> 8041.03s]  to look at my, I gotta go to the office. I gotta look at see what's going on here. Check profit
[8041.03s -> 8055.94s]  statement. Last month's profits were 900 bucks. Not bad. Let's see. All right. Okay. This is going
[8055.94s -> 8076.50s]  to come down though. Wait. Food. Clerks. Stands. How do I make this more money? Staff. 5200 bucks
[8076.50s -> 8093.37s]  a month. Who can we lose? Nobody. Um, it's, everything's going fine. I'm going to need
[8093.37s -> 8107.43s]  another dinosaur though. A big one. One that can pull in big numbers. Are we doing enough food?
[8108.31s -> 8138.90s]  I'm going to get a T-Rex next. I'm already out of fucking food again. All right. Uh,
[8139.62s -> 8149.27s]  let me go to real estate for a second. So we've got one here. Spot up there. Spot up here.
[8150.07s -> 8161.19s]  What do I got? 5900. How much is a T-Rex? I did it. Okay. Now I'm going to save money until I get,
[8161.19s -> 8182.62s]  I can afford a T-Rex. I'm firing somebody too. I'm bleeding money, I think. Fire the tour guide.
[8182.62s -> 8188.09s]  No, I think the tour guide is necessary. Should I make the prices cheaper or should I make them
[8188.09s -> 8202.31s]  more expensive? Cheaper? To get more people? Why can I not set the prices? Do I have to set the
[8202.31s -> 8232.12s]  prices per year? I don't get to change my prices. It's, everything's fine. 49 cheap winter tickets
[8232.12s -> 8244.06s]  and expensive summer tickets. Yeah, that's what my theory was before too. This would be an 8 out of
[8244.06s -> 8256.34s]  10 stream, but that fly is making it a 6 out of 10. You can't fuck out of here. Your annual income
[8256.34s -> 8263.03s]  tax for the park was $333. You're going to tax me. End of the year. Make any changes for first
[8263.03s -> 8271.77s]  quarter now. Clock has stopped and will resume when you leave the office. Here we go. So let's
[8271.77s -> 8279.13s]  make the ticket price in the winter, 4 bucks. Spring, 5 bucks. Summer, 6 bucks. Fall, 5 bucks.
[8279.13s -> 8293.14s]  650. Does it lay the house out? I can't make it that cheap. $7 for summer? That's kind of high.
[8296.01s -> 8307.53s]  3, no, 350, 450, 7, 5. 650 and 5. Same thing with food. Let's go. It looks fine, right?
[8308.73s -> 8319.56s]  Staff, 52 per month. All right. That seems pretty good. What about my bank loan? Okay. Current
[8319.56s -> 8326.55s]  balance is, why is the balance of more than what I, current loan amount, 33. All right. Okay,
[8326.55s -> 8335.02s]  I was going to say, what are you talking about? I think that's good. Snacks. You have one concessions
[8335.02s -> 8344.25s]  and one food stand. People are vandalizing the property. Get security. Shit. 45 people
[8344.25s -> 8351.67s]  came to the park yesterday. That's really bad. How many people go to Disney World every day?
[8352.23s -> 8369.90s]  Like 300,000 people. That's not good. 45? All right. I think I'm ready. You have 11 units of
[8369.90s -> 8382.68s]  meat and 12 units of plants. All right, let's go. What else do we got? Advertising. Somebody
[8382.68s -> 8390.34s]  just said that. Flyers. Cheap way to reach people. Just hand these out. Flyers. Newspaper. What's
[8390.34s -> 8396.47s]  this? Free our extra super special deluxe bonus gift package when you spend $10,000 or more.
[8398.15s -> 8409.18s]  Oh, all right. All right. Let's do, let's do cheap flyers. And I also need a fence. My money. My
[8409.18s -> 8428.28s]  money. My money. Open the park. Ah, why? What's happening? What's happening? Why is this? Hey,
[8428.28s -> 8446.78s]  what's happening? What's going on? I need a loan right now. All right. I just got a loan.
[8455.46s -> 8462.86s]  I'm just hemorrhaging money. What am I hemorrhaging money on? The staff? There's too
[8462.86s -> 8472.31s]  many people that work here. I had to buy food. Oh, I'm in trouble. I have to fire everybody.
[8472.31s -> 8480.20s]  How do I fire people? Bring them all in. Bring every, you may not have enough money to pay your
[8480.20s -> 8485.32s]  bills at the end of the month. Go to the bank if you need a loan. How do I fire? Fire. Fire. Fire.
[8485.32s -> 8492.78s]  Fire. You fired. You fired. You fired. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Staff. How do I fire people?
[8494.28s -> 8497.96s]  How do I fire people? There's no way I can't. People are throwing rocks.
[8498.68s -> 8518.76s]  I'll sell it. You've made the top 10 list. What's your name? Yoink. See you later. Somebody else's
[8518.76s -> 8540.92s]  problem now. Stop playing and hope they don't notice. Well, that's that. That was cute. That
[8540.92s -> 8549.38s]  was cute. Uh, the next one that I have here selected, this should be an interesting one.
[8549.38s -> 8554.02s]  It's called Rockstar. Well, you, you play as a rock star. You have to be a rock star or something.
[8554.74s -> 8566.79s]  It's just seem like a fun thing to do. Uh, those mesmerizing new age hypnosis. The wizard game.
[8566.79s -> 8570.47s]  Proudly. No, Fred, your amusement and amazement, bewilderment and confusion. The latest
[8570.47s -> 8574.95s]  psychedelic is driving against rock star. Welcome to the wonderful world of wizard games. You've

[8633.74s -> 8639.58s]  and have number one records everywhere. To achieve this, you must work hard, tour extensively,
[8639.58s -> 8643.98s]  spend lots of time and money in recording studios and video studios, do radio and tv
[8643.98s -> 8648.95s]  sessions and interviews and generally plan a campaign for world domination. Of course,
[8648.95s -> 8653.51s]  you'll find also time to enjoy yourself. There'll be groupies and parties and holidays and plenty
[8653.51s -> 8659.83s]  opportunities for overindulgence, but you mustn't overdo it or you'll end up in hospital or even
[8659.83s -> 8665.99s]  dead. Luckily your manager, dodgy Sam, your band and your friends question mark are there to give
[8665.99s -> 8670.31s]  you loving advice and protection, but are you up to it? Can you cope with the music business and be

[8766.09s -> 8775.88s]  No, not Larry the Loser. I'm doing Electric Leo. All right, let's go. Done. Do you want to change
[8775.88s -> 8795.32s]  any other artists' names? This is a whole roster of... I'm not doing that. Press highlight a key
[8795.32s -> 8801.88s]  or cursor keys and return to... All right, you are doing nothing. What do you want to do? Laze
[8801.88s -> 8809.10s]  around for a while. Write songs and practice. Gig. Record a single or album. Have a holiday.
[8809.10s -> 8822.30s]  Visit your doctor. Consult your analyst. Unwind in a sanitarium. Let's go to the doctor. That was
[8822.30s -> 8833.72s]  very fast. Hold on. I should probably slow this down. You are surprisingly healthy. You should
[8833.72s -> 8841.03s]  stop smoking. You are quite healthy, really. Eat an apple every day. Let's go back to the doctor.
[8842.70s -> 8847.72s]  You're quite healthy, really. You should stop smoking. All right, but my health is... All right,
[8847.72s -> 8860.23s]  let's go. Let's laze around for a while. New music maker UK popularity poll published today. New

[8894.62s -> 8948.01s]  money? Well, what happened? What do you do for drugs? I dabble in some weed air in there.

[9178.46s -> 9194.10s]  Codename Iceman. You, you don't want me to play Scrabble. No, you don't. You don't. I can't believe
[9194.10s -> 9198.94s]  you really want me to do this. You guys wanted me to get away from the Donald Duck game. Let's be
[9198.94s -> 9207.42s]  clear. Stop playing Donald Duck, but dear God, by a huge majority, get into Scrabble and play that
[9207.42s -> 9236.60s]  for an hour. Okay. The people who have spoken. It is a great game, but okay. The deluxe computer

[9747.27s -> 9755.59s]  timer. 30 seconds. Well, I could just, I could just change it to 10 seconds every time, right?
[9755.59s -> 9773.50s]  Yeah. I can just take forever. They get 10 seconds. Okay. So we've got, uh, fate time.
[9774.14s -> 9783.34s]  Will that work? That it's not time. That's how you misspell time when you talk really fast.
[9783.34s -> 9816.49s]  Timer, timer, timer. Uh, add tad mad. I could do mad, mad, mad. CPU one is stumped.
[9817.21s -> 9827.45s]  Well, that means they're replacing their words. They're, they're okay. What do you win Scrabble

[10117.13s -> 10143.90s]  does it have 48 points then? Bottom to top. Just go with nifty. Oh, my fucking stomach hurts.
[10145.18s -> 10155.13s]  That's only going to give me 36 points. If I do the upside down Tiffany, it's 48.
[10167.91s -> 10176.58s]  Affinity? Good thing we have a timer. No, it doesn't fit.
[10188.18s -> 10212.68s]  How is that less than the upside down Tiffany? Do you understand? I'm doing it. T-I-F. T-I-F.

[20021.47s -> 20026.03s]  because i know where the keys are but i don't here's the thing i know where every key is
[20027.50s -> 20035.46s]  in fact just to make sure i could prove this to people but how does no i'm i was going to
[20035.46s -> 20051.98s]  draw a keyboard without looking but how but i can't prove that i listen i know where every key is
[20054.14s -> 20061.26s]  on the keyboard but my problem is not in knowing where the keys are my problem is hand placement
[20061.90s -> 20068.62s]  and when i move my finger let's say for instance like f g t r that little spot there like asdf
[20068.62s -> 20074.78s]  put do it do this with me at the same time pinky on a ring finger on s middle d index f

[20827.68s -> 20846.77s]  fast as possible i don't care if i make errors did i mess up too many times he was not used to
[20846.77s -> 20875.10s]  the heaviness of the earth's atmosphere yeah i would how the fuck do some of you guys do this
[20875.10s -> 20893.20s]  shit how do you do 100 words a minute i don't even know how that's possible that's so so fast
[20913.09s -> 20926.22s]  speed hold on a minute speed by key i hit n r y and h the fastest that's kind of interesting
[20930.86s -> 20939.49s]  all right so yeah n r y h i d are the ones i hit the fastest all right uh words minute by session
[20940.38s -> 20960.74s]  no accuracy by key i can always get the z i the s j and t are my problem zones all of them
[20960.74s -> 20972.66s]  are apparently number of keys i don't think even did any of those errors by hand my left hand
[20973.38s -> 20981.14s]  if only i didn't have this left hand that actually kind of makes sense though
[20984.06s -> 20999.28s]  errors by row interesting recovery rate after errors t r e a okay that's funny
[21004.50s -> 21025.89s]  uh backspace errors n has the most interesting that's pretty funny surprisingly good software

[21436.70s -> 21452.78s]  fast it's going too far i have to be level one even if it's on times three speed i didn't even
[21452.78s -> 21455.90s]  do anything i didn't press any buttons you would have heard it you would have heard that
[21456.70s -> 21469.62s]  i did not press anything just go go go go go i can do it this is fucked up sometimes the presses
[21469.62s -> 21487.26s]  don't work all right it's just fucked up this is really messed up i can feel it hanging oh

[21658.75s -> 21662.43s]  use a controller no that was just a little fun thing to do at the end
[21666.80s -> 21678.90s]  yeah i saved you all right that's gonna be it right at the six hour mark those were quite a few
[21678.90s -> 21688.80s]  uh games by the way i can still hear it though so i have to turn this off get out of my head what
[21688.80s -> 21694.56s]  the fuck okay i don't know if it's just me is it just me because when i took out my headphone
[21695.20s -> 21704.54s]  it was like is that happening anybody else take your headphones out right now it was like
[21711.74s -> 21737.71s]  um i my voice right now is dude that was fucking wild shattered eardrum no it wasn't but it was
[21737.71s -> 21745.07s]  on very low it's just that sound just permeated my brain maybe you should go to the doctor tomorrow
[21745.07s -> 21761.06s]  yeah maybe no anyways that's gonna be it so i not 100 positive about this there is probably
[21761.06s -> 21772.43s]  gonna be a stream tomorrow depending on if um i can get this all set up i don't know how long
[21772.99s -> 21780.77s]  that will be or maybe i won't i don't know it depends on how this whole thing gets set up
[21781.33s -> 21789.98s]  i'm not sure i was invited to play uh terraria with mr star so i don't know if he's streaming it or
[21791.10s -> 21795.74s]  if i'm gonna turn on a stream we might just play i don't really know what's gonna happen
[21796.54s -> 21808.26s]  so i really don't know because i usually do three days on and then a few days off i do usually two
[21808.26s -> 21812.82s]  three days on and then two or three days off so tomorrow is very tentative to i really have no
[21812.82s -> 21820.00s]  idea if there is a stream tomorrow it'll be kind of random there's no time tomorrow if it's like oh
[21820.00s -> 21825.20s]  hey it's set up and the server works and everything works fine and it's like six o'clock or something
[21825.20s -> 21831.68s]  pacific then i'll just turn it on or something so i don't really have a time frame for tomorrow
[21831.68s -> 21842.02s]  i have no idea just whenever it happens if it happens there you go there is uh still the
[21842.02s -> 21849.55s]  possibility that because the last thing that star said was we need to get like some mod thing
[21851.14s -> 21858.86s]  and that was it i don't know if maybe there'll be server issues i don't know it might happen
[21858.86s -> 21873.50s]  should be interesting regardless but uh i will see you probably tomorrow take care everybody
[21873.50s -> 21885.47s]  good to see you we are going to go back to uh six hours ago uh should be pretty quick tonight

[22049.42s -> 22063.14s]  client of that game does that still exist did i upload that on my channel or was that on an
[22063.14s -> 22080.45s]  old machinima channel years ago because i know i the whole grandpa call of duty stuff all were

[22167.25s -> 22172.30s]  economy is crashing and we uh we talked about it in the very beginning of the stream right when it
[22172.30s -> 22177.82s]  turned on actually if you were not here i kind of gave my thoughts on it they'll patch it they'll
[22177.82s -> 22186.27s]  probably rewind everything and it'll be like as if it never happened and if that doesn't happen
[22187.44s -> 22192.54s]  then who has any idea what's going to happen after that
[22198.06s -> 22212.35s]  it's being called the crate depression oh god of course it is but it's an interesting scenario
[22212.35s -> 22216.83s]  i wonder how it'll play out in the long run i'm sure it'll be already fixed and patched by
