[1.53s -> 7.00s]  So let's see if they can get it situated at least somewhat playable in like an hour or two.
[7.00s -> 14.46s]  Let's go. I get it. Uh, well, I don't even need... I don't have to change the title.
[14.46s -> 27.48s]  That title is fine. So you lied to us yesterday. Wait, what did I say yesterday? What did I say
[27.48s -> 41.16s]  yesterday? You said jackbox. Yeah, but do you want just a random jackbox stream for like two
[41.16s -> 46.14s]  hours? Do you want like a five to seven hour jackbox stream on Friday? You know what I mean?
[52.49s -> 67.88s]  Do it both. Well, no, we're doing it on Friday. He's a liar. Right. He's like, well, wait, hold on.
[67.88s -> 74.20s]  Didn't I say yesterday that depending on how long we were in Red Dead 2, that we would do jackbox
[74.76s -> 78.52s]  maybe depending on if it was, if I only was in it for like an hour or two, right?
[78.52s -> 86.07s]  Didn't I say something like that along those lines? Yes. Yes. Yes, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Yes,
[86.07s -> 100.38s]  I did. Yeah. Yes. See, it's just like online. See? Yeah, let's give them some time to try
[100.38s -> 114.54s]  it again because I still haven't done all this. Where we going here? Jackbox, jackbox.
[115.59s -> 125.38s]  Friday will be fun. So I need to go here. So we need to take a stage coach from here
[126.55s -> 135.98s]  all the way across the world to here and then ride home roads. Oh, why can't today be fun?
[138.12s -> 148.18s]  Well, because we attempted to play a beta that wasn't ready. Am I going to make rules
[148.18s -> 158.31s]  for people joining the game this time? You mean jackbox? Let me actually, I might be able to
[158.31s -> 162.87s]  set something up where it just picks people randomly. Isn't that like an extension for you
[162.87s -> 169.27s]  that you can get that and then like that, that person, that person gets picked again.
[170.55s -> 177.35s]  I could do it like that. That'd be fun. Why do I hate Red Dead single player so much? Oh,
[177.35s -> 182.23s]  no, I don't. I love this game. I think this game is awesome. It's just, I mean, the
[182.23s -> 187.35s]  multiplayer is just the new thing and it's really, really interesting. Like, oh wow,
[187.35s -> 195.98s]  it's Rockstar's new online in the wild west. Cool. I think my horse's foot just explode.
[196.70s -> 212.70s]  I hate jackbox. Play Fistful of Frags. I don't even have it installed. Remember,
[212.70s -> 215.98s]  I reinstalled Windows. Remember the Windows update bullshit I was going through
[216.62s -> 221.18s]  where we just would not turn it. Where is this marker? Oh, right. Stagecoach.
[224.06s -> 234.97s]  Yeah, I had to reinstall Windows completely. So I lost all my downloads. I tried to get as
[234.97s -> 241.98s]  many things as I wanted before. Peggle 2 got me excited.
[244.38s -> 263.59s]  Full of, I'm full of letdowns, guys. I'm sorry. It's only like two gigs. Letdown stream.
[263.59s -> 277.46s]  No. Damn I though. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I gotta get up before anybody witnesses it.
[277.46s -> 288.14s]  Quick, get me to Rhodes Ranch before somebody witnesses me. Uh, Coachman. Hello. Hello.
[289.30s -> 304.22s]  I'd like to take a ride. Take a ride, please. Take a ride. Coachman. L2. What the fuck?
[304.22s -> 322.55s]  Am I sure I'm not online? Who is shooting? Is it the guy? Is it the guy that I bumped into?
[323.35s -> 341.42s]  It's not a bounty. It's what? Wait, did I what? What did I just do? I just like broke into his lock.
[345.58s -> 362.22s]  Break. Oh, God. Did I break his wagon? This guy's gonna dump this thing off the end.
[364.97s -> 368.97s]  Where's my horse? Oh, for the love of God, this is gonna be bad up ahead.
[373.30s -> 394.33s]  Stop shooting. You have so many opportunities. Fuck off. No, now you decided to come. Now
[394.33s -> 406.34s]  you decided to come over here, horse, huh? It was the guy. It was the guy I bumped into.
[406.98s -> 417.80s]  You just couldn't let it go. Now you let it go permanently. All right. Back to the stage,
[417.80s -> 439.18s]  Coach. Before this guy sees me over here. Wait. What was that? Somebody in the water?
[439.82s -> 462.39s]  I don't see him. There's a random stranger over here somewhere. Oh, there he is.
[463.74s -> 472.95s]  All right. What's what? What do you need help with, sir? Mad preacher.
[499.14s -> 499.46s]  What?
[510.42s -> 511.30s]  Am I the signal?
[516.95s -> 517.35s]  No.
[523.99s -> 536.22s]  Okay. Well, that was it. He's going back up here. Is there something I can do with this guy?
[537.02s -> 539.66s]  Besides just push him off the cliff into the water, which is what
[540.62s -> 577.50s]  I'm sure everybody wants me to do. Where is he? Look out, mister.
[581.53s -> 614.89s]  That didn't hurt him. Okay. Got it. This is all I need.
[615.91s -> 628.84s]  Okay. Now why is this happening? All right. Come with me. First circle the talk while running.
[632.12s -> 650.47s]  No, whoops. No. All right. I need to pick him up. No, I'm not going to do anything to him.
[650.47s -> 661.94s]  I just wanted to see what he would do if I jumped on him. I'm putting him back in bed.
[666.47s -> 671.08s]  I might've hurt him a little bit, but he's back in bed. He's going to be fine. All right.
[671.08s -> 678.30s]  Have a nice day. He just witnessed an assault. Well, he's the guy that I
[678.30s -> 687.34s]  asked. Oh, now we're doing it all over again. How do I like to?
[695.80s -> 696.76s]  Nothing. Relax.
[706.84s -> 744.44s]  Just stop. Stop. Hey, stop it. Stop. What's the objective here? There really is none.
[744.44s -> 759.22s]  Goodbye. Have fun. Enjoy the rest of your life. That's not how you make friends. That's how I
[759.22s -> 794.49s]  make friends with GTA Online and Rockstar Online. Enjoy the bounty. All right. We're good.
[794.49s -> 807.96s]  So I need to go. It was the fucking stagecoach because the guy, look, it all started. This
[807.96s -> 812.68s]  15 to 20 straight minute nonsense started because I bumped. I ran into a guy in town
[813.80s -> 844.31s]  and it just spiraled out of control. Five dollar bounty. I can pay that. What's this?
[845.35s -> 855.29s]  Why is there a red circle in there? So the sheriff's office. Just pay the bounty. Take the
[855.29s -> 864.98s]  stagecoach. Everybody hates me here. Let's not forget. I bumped into the guy and he started
[864.98s -> 879.94s]  shooting wildly. Got no bounties anymore. They're all gone. Back to square one. We're good.
[883.69s -> 890.98s]  Stagecoach is where exactly are you right now? I already have it marked.
[891.94s -> 896.87s]  Why do I have so much money? Because I just did a couple missions where I made a lot of money.
[897.59s -> 907.29s]  I'm a good boy again. Just don't bump into somebody. Don't smash into someone.
[908.17s -> 917.56s]  Get to the stagecoach without any issues. Pay it. Go to Rhodes. Do the mission.
[919.30s -> 931.67s]  Do not break the lock. Rhodes Ranch. Take me there. I'm about 45 percent of the way
[931.67s -> 940.22s]  through the store. 43 maybe. I'm still playing this. We've got somewhere to be.
[943.27s -> 956.78s]  Yeah. Well I couldn't do online because there's all kinds of problems with it. I will give it
[956.78s -> 961.98s]  another solid attempt before I consider ending the stream. That is certain. So don't worry.
[961.98s -> 971.83s]  And then nothing tomorrow. That'll lead us into Friday for Jack Box Party Pack 5. And then
[971.83s -> 977.69s]  into the weekend we've got the movie night on Sunday. So should be fun this weekend. I'm
[977.69s -> 996.36s]  looking forward to it a lot. Let's progress. Let's progress the story of Red Dead 2.
[1004.34s -> 1014.95s]  I can't wait to get hammered and watch this weekend.
[1019.48s -> 1024.58s]  I mean Jack Box is a lot of fun. The movie night's gonna be probably a lot of fun too.
[1029.11s -> 1035.30s]  I'm also planning on doing that. I'm not sure. I don't know if that's in my plan.
[1035.38s -> 1041.30s]  We'll see. Maybe I'll have a couple of drinks during the movie night. That sounds fun.
[1042.66s -> 1048.71s]  We're gonna find my specs in my mouse. I don't even have it listed here, right?
[1049.75s -> 1054.41s]  What did I do? Is there a command still? I think there was a command at one point.
[1055.29s -> 1064.84s]  Oh there it is. Oh yeah there it is. Take a look at that. I've got 176850s.
[1064.84s -> 1078.42s]  Hey can we talk about this later? We need to learn Dutch. I have a 6850k, a
[1080.42s -> 1089.72s]  GTX 1080 hybrid. What does that mean? They were planning a visit to the Braithwaite
[1089.72s -> 1094.60s]  place but John needs to do something for Dutch now so Hosea wants you to join him.
[1094.60s -> 1099.72s]  I'll join Hosea. Seems to be a lot going on. Yeah I know I wrote that but what does it
[1099.72s -> 1107.30s]  mean? I don't know what that means. Let's get some free food. That sounds good.
[1108.18s -> 1119.82s]  The GTX 1080 hybrid has an AIO water cooler. Oh maybe that's what it is. I don't have a TI or
[1119.82s -> 1125.85s]  anything. Oh this is cool too. Rob a home. Yeah I'm doing that instead.
[1126.81s -> 1132.17s]  Is your people there? Jack of weights or english lovers? I have a death header.
[1133.29s -> 1139.61s]  It's the only mouse I've owned in probably 10 years. My dad would say that no politics was
[1139.61s -> 1144.81s]  politics. That old world bullshit it ain't got no place here. Why? Because there ain't no judgment
[1144.81s -> 1150.81s]  here. Most folks hate the negroes. They hate the redskins. I just don't have uh. When you
[1150.81s -> 1154.57s]  get used to a mouse you kind of can't ever use anything else. I gave everyone just the same.
[1154.57s -> 1160.65s]  Well in that case you're gonna want what I just found for us. What's that? I was riding around
[1160.65s -> 1165.53s]  a couple of days back. I come across this old cabin. A couple of fuckers lazing about outside
[1165.53s -> 1170.97s]  all liquored up. I didn't think nothing of it. But then I come across this hunter down by the
[1170.97s -> 1176.33s]  river. He tells me they're a stick-up crew. Says they hit a train a couple of days back
[1176.33s -> 1180.57s]  near Emerald Ranch. Nice fellow he was. Shared a bottle we did. Then I robbed the
[1181.05s -> 1186.49s]  blind. You believed him? No reason not to. If he's right it'll be a big haul for us.
[1186.49s -> 1191.61s]  Hey gamers. Maybe more but I reckon you and me we could take them real easy.
[1192.81s -> 1199.02s]  What the hell. Let's go check it out. Them sons of bitches think they're mean.
[1199.66s -> 1206.49s]  They're about to get a lesson in mean. You just keep your cool you hear me. These missions
[1206.49s -> 1210.81s]  are a lot of fun because you actually make a shitload of money doing them. Not that I need
[1210.81s -> 1217.45s]  money but it's been nice to have it and never have to worry about it. Follow behind Sean.
[1218.65s -> 1221.69s]  Oh your horse is named Sean too. That's kind of cool.
[1234.07s -> 1236.15s]  It's a bit of a ride. Oh well we got time.
[1239.74s -> 1253.54s]  That is my horse. Oh well cool. I miss Sean. Me too. I want to just go dunk on people in
[1253.54s -> 1280.42s]  multiplayer. You mean get dunked on in multiplayer? No. Should we be talking to him? Come on man.
[1280.42s -> 1288.41s]  What were you doing right looking for the take? I got a lot of nose for these things.
[1288.41s -> 1291.93s]  Duchess always honored us to get out there and bring in money ain't he?
[1291.93s -> 1297.13s]  And rightly so. I ain't like some of them others back there sitting around waiting to be
[1297.13s -> 1303.53s]  told I go after it. I see you sitting around planning. I mean I don't need no cuddling like
[1303.53s -> 1309.61s]  the rest. Have you played multiplayer yet? Yeah. We tried it for a few hours earlier.
[1309.69s -> 1313.85s]  It did not work. Well it half worked.
[1317.37s -> 1325.13s]  I'm getting rock star server problems probably every 30 minutes or so every 20 minutes and
[1325.13s -> 1331.61s]  then it upped in frequency and it started happening every like five minutes so we decided
[1331.61s -> 1334.41s]  we were going to take a break from it for like an hour to do a couple story missions
[1334.41s -> 1339.21s]  play this for a little bit and try it again see if it gets any better in a couple hours.
[1340.09s -> 1348.82s]  What's that box boy his tent for then? Camp funds supplies in fact you don't know
[1348.82s -> 1353.70s]  that suggests you clearly ain't put much in it. I always pay me way don't you worry.
[1354.66s -> 1359.30s]  How long am I gonna stream? You're sure you scope this place out right?
[1359.94s -> 1363.78s]  Yes see that's why you want the job. Probably for at least another few hours.
[1363.78s -> 1366.98s]  You're still a doubter. I ain't just some dumb kid.
[1367.54s -> 1373.38s]  Four hours or so probably. And you sure don't keep it bottled up inside.
[1373.38s -> 1377.38s]  I would assume. Made a good show in there didn't I?
[1378.02s -> 1381.06s]  You got knocked down. Ah that's what you two should remember.
[1381.06s -> 1384.42s]  Quick make a joke. We got paid. Um um um.
[1384.42s -> 1390.09s]  Got knocked down didn't you? No that was us.
[1390.09s -> 1395.26s]  Did you get split off with Mac? A guy a guy and a guy walking to a
[1395.26s -> 1398.78s]  bar. The guy behind the counter says what are you guys doing here?
[1398.78s -> 1402.30s]  Guy number one says my wife's gonna be angry. Guy number two says
[1402.30s -> 1407.77s]  so's mine. Guy number three. Jenny didn't even make it that far.
[1407.77s -> 1412.12s]  All right we're nearly there. Hard left coming up.
[1412.12s -> 1436.98s]  I was getting a text. I do have oh I know what it is. I know what it is.
[1436.98s -> 1441.30s]  I got a coffee table. My coffee table is coming in.
[1441.30s -> 1447.85s]  Yes yes. Here let's make sure we keep one of them alive. That's where they
[1447.85s -> 1450.65s]  stash the money. Hope you know what you're doing.
[1450.65s -> 1459.96s]  That was a terrible punch line. Um oh that's right I was telling a joke.
[1459.96s -> 1468.12s]  Guy number three uh something about about something about a ferris wheel
[1468.12s -> 1471.24s]  and he was eating and I think he dropped it. I forget what happened
[1471.24s -> 1477.70s]  after that though. There's one of them outside. This is
[1477.70s -> 1482.02s]  good. It is. Leave it to me. I do the talking.
[1482.02s -> 1499.75s]  You hang back. Slowly slowly. I did find the aliens. I did.
[1499.75s -> 1504.04s]  That was what? That was a long time ago.
[1504.04s -> 1508.18s]  Weirdly enough I found that I think in the first six hours of me playing the
[1508.18s -> 1513.42s]  game. I'm gonna give you and your daddy about
[1513.42s -> 1516.62s]  five seconds to get the hell out of my property boy.
[1516.62s -> 1520.46s]  Look we don't want no trouble. We just thought you might like to know
[1520.46s -> 1523.02s]  we passed a big posse alarm and headed this way.
[1523.02s -> 1526.79s]  Now it doesn't have a coming up beast. What?
[1526.79s -> 1532.49s]  Where? Right here. It's a marker. Here come the rest of them.
[1532.57s -> 1553.75s]  We've got what?
[1559.75s -> 1564.55s]  No. No.
[1565.27s -> 1588.06s]  Can I wake him up? I was stuck in the doorway and I pressed r2.
[1588.06s -> 1591.02s]  Look I I'm gonna put the fire out and then pull the lever underneath.
[1591.02s -> 1604.36s]  Don't worry I got it. Oh look a stash box. Oh well the game
[1604.36s -> 1610.44s]  found it for me. Thank you game. I really appreciate the help.
[1610.52s -> 1617.70s]  What was that? Double action revolver. That's kind of cool.
[1617.70s -> 1637.82s]  I'm not leaving yet. Hold on. Wait a minute. No that's my skull field though.
[1637.82s -> 1654.74s]  What's better when this is clean? Hold on. Is the skull field better?
[1654.74s -> 1659.54s]  Um I mean kind of. Accuracy. It's much more accurate.
[1659.54s -> 1663.14s]  Fire rate's lower but now that I think this thing sucks.
[1663.14s -> 1670.62s]  Because I have two skull fields and they are beautiful.
[1670.62s -> 1682.98s]  All right. Anything else? This guy died I guess.
[1682.98s -> 1687.50s]  Is he dead? He wasn't dead when I looked at him before.
[1687.50s -> 1702.17s]  No he's alive see. Take the meats. Not at all.
[1702.17s -> 1728.90s]  Search the cabinets. Free gin. I'll take it.
[1728.90s -> 1738.20s]  Where was the money? Where's the money? I know it's a secret little spot.
[1738.20s -> 1748.47s]  Oh there's money right here. 15 bucks. Pretty good.
[1748.47s -> 1764.10s]  Piss in the fire. You can't pee in this game so I'm sorry.
[1764.10s -> 1768.18s]  Can I not get the secret? Whoa whoa whoa.
[1768.18s -> 1774.58s]  Oh that's wrong. Maybe they have to tell you where it is.
[1774.58s -> 1807.72s]  I don't think I can get it. No prompts. No nothing.
[1807.72s -> 1810.76s]  Read chat. It's it's in the wall behind the bed.
[1810.76s -> 1822.12s]  I I just was there. The wall behind the bed. Wasn't I just over here?
[1822.12s -> 1827.05s]  I don't think I can get it without his prompt. Yeah you can't unless the
[1827.05s -> 1830.82s]  NPC tells you. See I you can call me stupid for hitting
[1830.82s -> 1833.06s]  the guy in the face of the barrel earlier.
[1833.14s -> 1858.84s]  Let's go girl. No the piss code. I can't get it without him telling you.
[1858.84s -> 1862.44s]  Yeah I wouldn't that would make sense. Otherwise you could just stay there all
[1862.44s -> 1872.07s]  day and just walk around and find it. All right Joseo what do you need?
[1872.07s -> 1877.45s]  This is not Joseo. Not at all actually.
[1877.45s -> 1892.63s]  Holy shit. Come on I gotta get the head exploding
[1892.63s -> 1922.70s]  achievement. Trophy earned. 100 heads exploded with shotgun.
[1922.70s -> 1931.37s]  So we've got uh probably some cool stuff here. These are bad
[1931.37s -> 1942.57s]  guys so it's okay. I mean yeah. Look for a lock box.
[1942.57s -> 1948.49s]  That's a lock box. If I was a lock box I'd be this one.
[1948.49s -> 1958.90s]  Medical box actually. Miracle cure. I can't take any more of it.
[1958.90s -> 1963.86s]  Opened miracle tonic. I might as well just use one right.
[1963.86s -> 1967.46s]  Where's the mirror? All right potent miracle tonic. Opened miracle tonic.
[1967.46s -> 1970.52s]  Just take it and pick up the other one.
[1970.52s -> 1984.89s]  Okay I think that's it. That's the most important thing at least. Oh no this
[1984.89s -> 1997.75s]  can I open this too? Yeah. Yeah. Hey. That's all you have in there is hey.
[1997.75s -> 2004.52s]  Uh assorted biscuits. Feeded the horse.
[2004.52s -> 2012.38s]  Corn. This is just stocking me up on food. If you piss in the fire it gives
[2012.38s -> 2019.53s]  you a code for unlimited lives. I don't want it anyways. Who wants
[2019.53s -> 2032.87s]  unlimited lives right now? Check one more time.
[2032.87s -> 2042.76s]  Ah hello there. Don't mind if I do. Who wants to live forever? No I don't
[2042.76s -> 2047.80s]  want to. Why would you want to live forever?
[2047.80s -> 2054.58s]  Okay instead of living forever could I choose a different option?
[2054.58s -> 2057.94s]  Could I just you know once I'm once I'm gone can I
[2057.94s -> 2061.30s]  like unlock an ability instead of oh I want to be alive. Live forever.
[2061.30s -> 2064.50s]  No just every like 100 years. No no probably
[2064.50s -> 2068.34s]  30 years. Every 30 years I just want to turn into like a spirit and just
[2068.34s -> 2071.38s]  kind of see what's going on. Just like walk around and look at stuff.
[2071.38s -> 2076.74s]  You know every 30 years just oh here we go. Oh okay what so what's going on now?
[2076.74s -> 2089.51s]  What's the world like now? You can do that now just be a hermit. Yeah but
[2089.51s -> 2093.75s]  you can only do that for like two times. You can go live in a cave and eat
[2093.75s -> 2097.51s]  dirt and like ping in a cup and drink it and like eat rabbits and stuff.
[2097.51s -> 2100.87s]  And then come out in 30 years and look around and be like holy shit.
[2100.87s -> 2106.50s]  But you can only do that like twice. I'm talking literally forever.
[2106.50s -> 2108.50s]  What's what if the world is destroyed and then you can just turn
[2108.50s -> 2114.87s]  it off. You can just after you wake up for that
[2114.87s -> 2118.07s]  time and it's like well this is the world is just a smoldering crater right
[2118.07s -> 2121.35s]  now. Oh okay like um I would not like to do
[2121.35s -> 2124.39s]  this again but I would want to do it at least.
[2124.39s -> 2128.50s]  No no no no no no no. No that's not a good idea. That'd be awesome
[2128.50s -> 2132.34s]  because if you kept doing that imagine like what would happen.
[2132.34s -> 2135.38s]  Like we're talking about an entirely new like
[2135.38s -> 2140.10s]  species. If you woke up every 30 years and the world was just abandoned
[2140.10s -> 2142.82s]  like in five million years this probably gonna be like a weird fucking
[2142.82s -> 2151.99s]  new creature that takes over the whole planet.
[2152.55s -> 2163.32s]  We're talking about living forever versus waking up every 50 years just to
[2163.32s -> 2166.28s]  kind of see what's going on. What are you doing?
[2166.28s -> 2169.80s]  Every hundred years yeah. Selling it back to where it came from.
[2169.80s -> 2173.24s]  I ain't got a market for it. They made it. Imagine waiting
[2173.24s -> 2177.56s]  five million years for bacteria. Stuff look kind of lonely out here.
[2177.56s -> 2180.44s]  I think we'll cut ourselves a deal. Yeah and then you could just observe
[2180.44s -> 2183.48s]  forever. You and Dutch was just doing your duty when you
[2183.56s -> 2187.88s]  requisitioned it. Waking up every hundred years.
[2187.88s -> 2195.26s]  And you get you get fast travel and you get 30 minutes.
[2195.26s -> 2199.42s]  Right like we'll see you later. Spend 10 minutes in like
[2199.42s -> 2203.98s]  Rome. What's going on here? Well that's interesting.
[2203.98s -> 2210.57s]  Spend 20 minutes in fucking Boston. What's Boston like?
[2210.57s -> 2214.73s]  So what exactly are we doing? This is the moonshine we took.
[2214.73s -> 2218.41s]  We're like an hour or something. Like two hours.
[2218.41s -> 2223.53s]  What would the point be if you can't affect anything?
[2223.53s -> 2226.57s]  Well then it's time we made a formal introduction.
[2226.57s -> 2229.77s]  Why would you want it? Don't you just want to know?
[2229.77s -> 2233.85s]  These are two big old plantation houses. All I keep hearing is they hate
[2233.85s -> 2236.41s]  each other so much they can't see past it.
[2236.41s -> 2240.44s]  I know. I've seen it. There's a gray boy
[2240.52s -> 2244.36s]  and a brave white girl carrying on a secret affair.
[2244.36s -> 2249.64s]  I've been well. What are you doing? Use the reins damn it.
[2249.64s -> 2255.74s]  The mind boggles. You think there's a street sweep to that guy?
[2255.74s -> 2259.42s]  They don't seem too involved in the rest of it but maybe.
[2259.42s -> 2263.42s]  Well I'm sure there's money in this for us somewhere if we can get in the
[2263.42s -> 2265.26s]  middle of it. There's a type of jellyfish that's
[2265.26s -> 2269.78s]  immortal. Hold on this is this is beautiful.
[2269.78s -> 2277.18s]  This is actually beautiful. Where in the map even are we? This is a sort of weird
[2277.18s -> 2325.50s]  road. Have uh. Did I get him? Why is this guy invincible?
[2325.50s -> 2345.64s]  Okay. Where's my scope? I have like a rifle don't I?
[2345.64s -> 2349.72s]  Horses got him. Hey that that horse got him without being checked.
[2349.72s -> 2358.82s]  That's not fair.
[2370.82s -> 2377.90s]  You may happily shoot me if I do. Okay okay.
[2377.90s -> 2383.03s]  Single player griefer. Oh don't sit on the back of that man.
[2383.03s -> 2387.77s]  Please don't sit on the back of that. We'll be watching you. You heard the man.
[2387.77s -> 2399.26s]  Driver proceed please. No I'm just. It is so tempting though you're right. It
[2399.26s -> 2402.73s]  really is. Just to drive him off the cliff
[2402.73s -> 2417.13s]  and just ghost ride him. Out something. Out in the hills thought.
[2417.13s -> 2420.25s]  Thought maybe you was in the market for it. For what?
[2420.25s -> 2423.61s]  Some liquor. I ain't in the market for what's already mine.
[2423.61s -> 2428.33s]  The way we see it it's ours. Well with us possessing it and I checked all over
[2428.33s -> 2431.21s]  for the life of me. I couldn't see your name on it.
[2431.21s -> 2437.88s]  Oh here comes the whole family. I know it seems that's easy enough.
[2437.88s -> 2441.72s]  Want to do a deal. Where do you sell that stuff?
[2441.72s -> 2445.16s]  Dollar a bottle. Give us 50 cents. It's already
[2445.24s -> 2449.48s]  ours. Well look on it as a reward for finding the property.
[2449.48s -> 2453.00s]  Alternative is we go sell it someplace else. The alternative is
[2453.00s -> 2459.80s]  you get shot. Now who wants to get shot over a bottle or two of liquor?
[2459.80s -> 2467.06s]  Pay the man. Really? Hosea quite the negotiator.
[2467.06s -> 2470.98s]  Pleasure doing business with you. And listen
[2470.98s -> 2475.06s]  we didn't take it. At least not without orders. Oh I know exactly who
[2475.06s -> 2480.34s]  gave you your orders. Old Sheriff Gray. You know what?
[2480.34s -> 2484.02s]  I don't want it. In fact sir now you can do me
[2484.02s -> 2487.14s]  a favor. There's an extra 10 bucks if you do.
[2487.14s -> 2491.38s]  Drop the stuff into Rhodes. Head over to the tavern run by Mr. Gray
[2491.38s -> 2495.70s]  and give the stuff out for free. Hush now.
[2495.70s -> 2499.94s]  I believe they call that a promotional expense.
[2500.02s -> 2503.38s]  They do. As you wish they do. That's true.
[2503.38s -> 2510.04s]  Come on Arthur let's take it out of here.
[2510.04s -> 2522.89s]  All right next stop the Rhodes Saloon. Here we go. Take the moonshine to Rhodes
[2522.89s -> 2524.81s]  Saloon. I finally sold those cornwall bonds.
[2524.81s -> 2529.45s]  Got close to a thousand for them. I wanted more but not bad considering how hot
[2529.45s -> 2531.85s]  they were especially after that bloodbath in
[2531.85s -> 2536.23s]  Valentine. No not bad at all. Apparently
[2536.55s -> 2541.99s]  gonna play fibbage. What is in that fifth party pack?
[2541.99s -> 2545.91s]  I don't know what's in it. I've seen a couple of random clips of what's in it
[2545.91s -> 2554.02s]  but I don't know every single game. We'll find out on Friday.
[2554.02s -> 2557.38s]  This could get ugly. You and Dutch already have that
[2557.38s -> 2560.50s]  thing going on in town with the sheriff.
[2560.50s -> 2566.26s]  Yeah Mr. Gray. That's it. Now we're uncertain ourselves in his
[2566.30s -> 2572.17s]  blood feud. We'll need something. I ain't playing
[2572.17s -> 2576.49s]  dressing. You know how I feel about that.
[2576.49s -> 2579.85s]  Of course you're not. He gave you three hundred dollars to do this. You're a
[2579.85s -> 2584.25s]  clown's idiot bro. 300 bucks is a lot of
[2584.25s -> 2588.25s]  money. I'm the clown. Back in like the 40s here.
[2588.25s -> 2593.61s]  Just and keep quiet. Even you can do that Arthur.
[2593.61s -> 2599.16s]  I have to do that.
[2599.16s -> 2607.00s]  Smoke this pipe. The 40s? Yeah. Bring your lip for it. Yeah somebody got like the 1740s.
[2607.00s -> 2611.24s]  Like the 1640s. Perfect. What about you?
[2611.24s -> 2617.75s]  What did you think I meant? You can't speak. 19?
[2619.19s -> 2622.31s]  Yowzers. You know what else people say? Yowzers.
[2622.31s -> 2657.74s]  Don't get mad. Little rocky. Why don't
[2657.90s -> 2660.38s]  they make like a gta or like a red dead type game
[2660.38s -> 2664.04s]  in caveman times?
[2664.04s -> 2675.46s]  I'll keep it and stay calm now. For mama she loved you so.
[2675.46s -> 2679.14s]  Just a shame you had to strangle her in her rage.
[2679.14s -> 2684.10s]  Grab two cases of that stuff and follow me.
[2684.10s -> 2689.10s]  Rockstar making a medieval europe game. I'm sure it would be amazing but
[2689.10s -> 2695.58s]  you know they can only do so many things. Although I can't say I'm too
[2695.66s -> 2699.90s]  sure how well they would handle melee combat.
[2699.90s -> 2707.24s]  Hey this is my brother Fenton. Don't mind him. Don't
[2707.24s -> 2711.16s]  Madden. Fenton? He's turned idiot. He killed our mother but it weren't his
[2711.16s -> 2714.12s]  fault. How'd you boys? How'd you boys like a couple of
[2714.12s -> 2717.96s]  bucks? I bet you would. I love Jose. Jose is awesome.
[2717.96s -> 2722.76s]  We're in the new trade of advertising. Which is an American art form about
[2722.76s -> 2726.28s]  ensuring people buy the correct things. I don't know.
[2726.36s -> 2731.00s]  One more dollar. Says give us half an hour. What harm can we do in half an
[2731.00s -> 2735.32s]  hour? Go along now. Enjoy the money.
[2735.32s -> 2740.74s]  Come on Fenton. Let's hand out the liquor.
[2740.74s -> 2745.98s]  Go behind the bar and let's see what. Cool.
[2745.98s -> 2749.58s]  Combat is fine in rockstar games with an S
[2749.58s -> 2760.41s]  with an S on it. That's my brother Fenton.
[2760.41s -> 2764.57s]  He's a bit funny but boy can he pour drinks fast.
[2764.65s -> 2767.77s]  For the next 30 minutes the drinks in this year bar
[2767.77s -> 2773.19s]  in this year town are entirely free.
[2790.38s -> 2796.06s]  Raise the bottle. Let's go. Pour it. All right take it.
[2796.14s -> 2811.08s]  Oh wait wait wait. Pour the bottle. How do I serve it?
[2811.08s -> 2815.86s]  Here take this one too.
[2818.41s -> 2822.01s]  You sure are playing the idiot role well.
[2822.01s -> 2837.69s]  Hey I'm gonna take one of these boys. I'm trying to put it down.
[2837.69s -> 2846.97s]  Okay so my boy Fenton can sure pour drinks fast.
[2846.97s -> 2870.02s]  Too fast one would say. I still have the same pipe in my mouth.
[2870.02s -> 2873.46s]  Are you sure this is alcohol and not like fucking like
[2873.46s -> 2877.06s]  molly? Like what the hell am I serving these people? Like ecstasy?
[2877.06s -> 2890.47s]  Good evening gentlemen. Quiet libation. You. Me. You're the bastards who stole
[2890.47s -> 2895.27s]  the liquor we was gonna buy. We're in advertising. Come on in.
[2895.27s -> 2901.06s]  It is moonshine that's right. Boys get them.
[2901.06s -> 2916.62s]  And just like that we had one more coming in.
[2924.04s -> 2929.35s]  Oh they're help. Uh oh. I don't know how to pour drinks. I don't know how to do
[2929.35s -> 2942.09s]  anything else. Jose Jose Jose Jose Jose Jose Jose.
[2942.09s -> 2954.58s]  Got him. What the fuck? I got him.
[2954.58s -> 2977.30s]  Ah there we go. Stairs. I can't move. I can't move. I can't move. That didn't
[2977.30s -> 2988.78s]  work. Please turn up your sensitivity.
[2988.78s -> 3008.36s]  Who the fuck? All right give me the repeater.
[3008.36s -> 3011.98s]  I want a better repeater than that. I don't have like a better repeater
[3011.98s -> 3015.16s]  than this shit. Is it on my horse or something?
[3015.16s -> 3021.14s]  Probably. Looks like they're about to until you
[3021.14s -> 3030.04s]  said that. More to my right.
[3030.04s -> 3040.98s]  Was that guy was that bad guy? Hey careful who you're shooting at.
[3040.98s -> 3044.26s]  That was not a bad guy. Well I mean what the hell are you doing standing
[3044.26s -> 3048.34s]  there? You need to get out of the way man.
[3048.34s -> 3053.62s]  Outlaws around. You don't want to be accidentally identified as an outlaw.
[3053.62s -> 3061.30s]  Because they're just either whoever's around I'm gonna have to beat it.
[3061.30s -> 3076.22s]  I'm being attacked from all sides. How dare he stand in town?
[3076.22s -> 3079.82s]  Well what it's just not only standing in town but standing just still
[3079.82s -> 3089.06s]  staring at me. I just yeah I got why he's got one shot.
[3089.06s -> 3092.98s]  How dare he look in my direction. Come on Arthur. We're gonna get out of
[3092.98s -> 3098.31s]  here Arthur. Doesn't look like it Arthur. Over
[3098.31s -> 3126.09s]  there to your left. Oh jeez Arthur. I'm sorry the guy
[3126.09s -> 3137.90s]  was looking at me. Well behind me is actually in front of us.
[3137.90s -> 3142.42s]  See look at these guys are just standing here. You understand that
[3142.42s -> 3144.90s]  those two guys are just standing around.
[3144.90s -> 3149.06s]  They just happen to be bad guys this time.
[3149.06s -> 3165.45s]  That was a bad idea.
[3165.61s -> 3177.34s]  Oh whoa whoa what was that? No these are not okay. That guy's
[3177.42s -> 3189.40s]  gonna be okay. Oh no he's not anymore.
[3189.40s -> 3206.98s]  Oh yeah you don't that's what I think that killed me is they hit the liquor.
[3206.98s -> 3212.65s]  Uh give me some tobacco. You see any more of them? Who thinks so?
[3212.65s -> 3220.63s]  Oh never mind never mind. Jesus all this over a few bottles of booze.
[3220.63s -> 3224.07s]  I reckon it's more they don't want another gang on their patch.
[3224.07s -> 3227.27s]  I was online. Something I'm gonna try again because it wasn't working very
[3227.27s -> 3231.91s]  well. Okay we'll give it a try soon here.
[3234.02s -> 3239.91s]  Another mission or something. We'll give it a go again.
[3239.91s -> 3245.69s]  Weird flex what? What?
[3245.69s -> 3251.05s]  What was it? Advertising. You think that woman set us up?
[3251.05s -> 3257.06s]  No I think so. Maybe. This place is odd.
[3257.06s -> 3261.58s]  I keep seeing those fellas. Some local militia.
[3261.58s -> 3266.07s]  Clearly not too happy to have some new competition. I'll go visit old mob
[3266.15s -> 3269.51s]  Braithwaite. See what's what. I gotta pee again.
[3269.51s -> 3272.87s]  The chest is filling up again slowly but surely.
[3272.87s -> 3276.15s]  Part of me thinks we just get ourselves good and lost.
[3276.15s -> 3279.67s]  But we still need a lot more money before that can happen.
[3279.67s -> 3285.99s]  So for now let me go give old Mrs. Braithwaite some of this moonshine as
[3285.99s -> 3290.87s]  well let's call it a peace offering. Sure.
[3290.87s -> 3294.07s]  This guy's old me.
[3298.63s -> 3302.07s]  I wouldn't mind. I mean he seems like he's pretty with it.
[3302.07s -> 3310.22s]  Play the entire Kingdom Hearts collection on stream.
[3310.22s -> 3313.50s]  So what do you think? I don't think so. About what?
[3313.50s -> 3317.18s]  Defying folks around these parts. Oh real nice.
[3317.18s -> 3321.18s]  Oh my god I'm gonna pull my ear off. On the one side we've got the gray family.
[3321.42s -> 3326.54s]  Scots degenerates drunkards the local law. You couldn't make this stuff up.
[3326.54s -> 3330.62s]  Rich is creasing. This thing is jammed in my ear. Wedged all the way in.
[3330.62s -> 3334.78s]  And I just yanked on it accidentally moving my butt around and I just pulled off my ear.
[3334.78s -> 3339.74s]  We believe in gold and in the middle of it all you got some
[3339.74s -> 3347.82s]  inbred retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Exactly. So what you boys thinking?
[3347.82s -> 3352.44s]  We try to rob them both.
[3352.44s -> 3358.74s]  Everybody in the camp. Why not? Because we got all men in three different states after us.
[3358.74s -> 3363.06s]  Last thing I want is to get us into trouble but we need money. Now we have
[3363.06s -> 3366.82s]  the opportunity here to put ourselves in the middle of something ain't nobody
[3366.82s -> 3370.74s]  gonna know we was here because even without us these fools
[3370.74s -> 3374.82s]  are gonna kill each other anyway. Okay well Hosea's gone back to see that
[3374.82s -> 3379.30s]  Braithwaite woman. Good Hosea should definitely take the lead on this.
[3379.30s -> 3384.10s]  I sent Sean over to Braithwaite manor too. Now you can meet up with them
[3384.10s -> 3388.50s]  or join John and Javier at the Gray's place. Something to do with the
[3388.50s -> 3392.50s]  Braithwaite's prize horses. How the hell did we get in at the
[3392.50s -> 3395.46s]  Gray's place? Sheriff Gray kindly put in a word with his father.
[3395.46s -> 3398.18s]  Can I have your ear? I'm making a voodoo doll.
[3398.18s -> 3401.70s]  We gotta convince each family that we're on their side.
[3401.70s -> 3405.38s]  Okay but can you not like do anything bad?

[3434.10s -> 3438.26s]  put me in front of the right in front of the ocean you know on the beach.
[3438.26s -> 3441.38s]  So put sunscreen on me and just let me hang out there.
[3441.38s -> 3457.10s]  What am I talking about? Did you not see the guy that just said he was
[3457.10s -> 3462.73s]  gonna make a voodoo doll of me? I'm telling him not to do bad don't
[3462.73s -> 3473.37s]  like stab me in the stomach with like knives.

[3480.71s -> 3482.87s]  some point. I need to hunt I haven't done
[3482.87s -> 3487.51s]  any of that. I've done a couple legendary animals but not enough to do
[3487.51s -> 3494.17s]  any of this stuff. Thanks Pearson. I'm gonna stab a voodoo
[3494.17s -> 3498.55s]  version of you with a knife. Don't do that though.
[3498.55s -> 3503.19s]  Take it on vacation with you and put like sunscreen on me but from the
[3503.19s -> 3507.59s]  beach. Just great but I nearly got killed back in town.
[3507.59s -> 3511.66s]  They caught me robbing from a store and I ran for my life.
[3511.66s -> 3514.94s]  You weren't followed here. Arthur Morgan
[3515.02s -> 3517.90s]  Of course not. Who do you think you're speaking to?
[3517.90s -> 3523.75s]  Good girl. Okay I'm gonna make a terrible
[3523.75s -> 3538.09s]  kill. I'm not gonna say it. All right so who do we want to go to?
[3538.09s -> 3543.85s]  I mean I like I like Hosea. So Hosea is kind of where I want to go
[3543.85s -> 3547.45s]  because it's Hosea and why would I not do Hosea?
[3547.45s -> 3550.73s]  Let's do this mission and then I'm gonna try online again. We'll see if
[3550.73s -> 3554.87s]  we can get to work. Wouldn't that just be the size of
[3554.87s -> 3559.56s]  a regular pillow? At least give me the benefit of the
[3559.56s -> 3561.56s]  doubt of having being a king size pillow.
[3561.56s -> 3576.14s]  Please. Not now. Not now.
[3576.14s -> 3582.86s]  Can I leave please?
[3582.86s -> 3593.18s]  Get away from me. You make a twin size bed look like a
[3593.22s -> 3608.33s]  California king. You understand how thick my body is?
[3608.33s -> 3617.02s]  My ass doesn't even fit on a twin mattress guys.
[3617.02s -> 3632.01s]  All right come on horse. You sound thick.
[3632.01s -> 3643.90s]  Well thick as in like T-H-I-C-K. C-K.
[3643.90s -> 3655.78s]  What happened to online? It didn't work. It was kind of broken.
[3655.78s -> 3666.82s]  So we're gonna try again.
[3673.72s -> 3676.92s]  Like you can never say the word thick ever again.
[3676.92s -> 3685.56s]  Okay if you were at work right let's say you're at work
[3685.56s -> 3688.92s]  and you walk into your boss's office and he's like oh yeah you know can
[3688.92s -> 3691.00s]  you just give me a hand with something here?
[3691.00s -> 3694.60s]  You're like yeah yeah yeah sure. There's a stack of paper over there.
[3694.60s -> 3697.80s]  I just I need to just grab it from me. I'm currently I'm about to be on
[3697.80s -> 3701.00s]  the phone. There's like three stacks of paper.
[3701.96s -> 3706.84s]  One of them is a very large stack and one of the smaller stack
[3706.84s -> 3709.40s]  and you're like oh which one do you want? He's like oh the thick one the
[3709.40s -> 3715.32s]  thicker one. You're gonna go ha thick to your boss.
[3715.32s -> 3723.51s]  Is that what that word's gonna turn into? You're gonna get instafired in
[3723.51s -> 3736.60s]  15 seconds? Hey founders I'm with Mrs. Braithwaite.
[3736.60s -> 3740.70s]  My associates are already here. Why not?
[3740.86s -> 3767.29s]  Ego maniac thinks he's our boss? No I just said thick and you guys
[3767.29s -> 3784.86s]  damn I can't ride the motorcycle into the house. Is everything all right?
[3784.86s -> 3792.82s]  Oh yeah everything's fine. Please come in sir.
[3792.82s -> 3802.39s]  Everything's okay. This way sir. A gentleman to see you ma'am.
[3802.39s -> 3806.63s]  So your friend the other liquor vendor. Hello. Hello ma'am.
[3806.71s -> 3809.67s]  Arthur welcome. We're just playing cribbage.
[3809.67s -> 3813.35s]  Arthur Morgan. Mrs. Catherine Braithwaite. Nice to see you again.
[3813.35s -> 3817.75s]  Apparently. So this one he is big and as dumb as he looks.
[3817.75s -> 3821.51s]  Well he's surely big but his intelligence is a matter of some
[3821.51s -> 3824.47s]  conjecture. Some say he is as dumb as he looks but
[3824.47s -> 3827.99s]  I think well he's not quite that dumb.
[3827.99s -> 3830.87s]  So these other boys going to Caligahal. He's so sick of that.
[3830.87s -> 3834.71s]  We could take care of that for you but one hates to be coarse. There is
[3835.19s -> 3838.87s]  the question. Oh yes you see he is dumb. Oh we've got money Mr.
[3838.87s -> 3843.11s]  Matthews. Thick yeah he's also he's very thick and dumb.
[3843.11s -> 3847.83s]  Thick. You yanky numbskull. Hey childbirth just the most beautiful
[3847.83s -> 3872.60s]  mare on earth. Seems a lady. The young one says it.
[3872.60s -> 3879.88s]  Childbirth is gross. What? Ready let's get out of here.
[3879.88s -> 3887.14s]  Why'd you just say that? You was quiet and I took everything I had.
[3887.14s -> 3891.70s]  That son of a whore. Come on Morgan pick up the pace here.
[3891.70s -> 3895.90s]  I'll shove that silver spoon down his throat
[3895.90s -> 3900.86s]  and pull it clean out of his ass. A smoke fucker.
[3900.86s -> 3906.82s]  What she got us doing at the grand court. Oh that's gonna be a
[3906.82s -> 3919.69s]  bingo for me Arthur. She said it'd be fitting she did.
[3919.69s -> 3923.05s]  I don't think in this hell of a way quite fitting my boot up your hook.
[3923.05s -> 3930.95s]  No just snotty old bitch. Maniac driver.
[3930.95s -> 3934.81s]  Can I do one thing without destruction?
[3935.69s -> 3942.49s]  Um it's it's faster. I'm going to get there faster.
[3942.49s -> 3946.25s]  I just saved a good two minutes right there.
[3955.77s -> 3961.61s]  So far we've destroyed the break weight still. I'm gonna pay for those fences.
[3961.61s -> 3964.33s]  They're just invoice men.
[3964.33s -> 3971.86s]  They were saying oh for a second. His dialogue didn't even.
[3971.86s -> 3976.90s]  Grays English. You not worried about them grays.
[3976.90s -> 3980.50s]  And what sense? Well they know you.
[3980.50s -> 3986.22s]  Now what? I'm gonna hide in the wagon. I'll go hiding back.
[3986.22s -> 3991.22s]  If you can act now stop us from getting into a fight before we're
[3991.22s -> 3994.74s]  ready. I will try. You're going too fast.
[3994.74s -> 4007.80s]  Going too fast. I'm not going to go that far.
[4007.80s -> 4016.22s]  Change Arthur's point of view. Okay this feels so sneaky.
[4016.22s -> 4019.58s]  No I'm staying here. I want to be inside this.
[4019.58s -> 4027.77s]  We're here stay out of sight. We'll do the talking.
[4027.77s -> 4043.56s]  Okay just drink the booze. What you want boys?
[4043.56s -> 4049.72s]  I there was a ting a ting at the saloon. There was a ting at the
[4049.72s -> 4054.52s]  saloon. Well I'm delivering the supplies.
[4054.52s -> 4058.36s]  You want a bottle friend here?
[4060.76s -> 4066.34s]  I got really long arms. I mean you know I've come from Donegal
[4066.34s -> 4072.18s]  in Ireland. Yeah they said you'd understand
[4072.18s -> 4075.94s]  there's some kind of incident at the saloon in town. I was told to bring
[4075.94s -> 4078.98s]  this up here. Ask no questions I'll tell you no lies
[4079.30s -> 4082.10s]  Sort the business out. Is it just one guy?
[4082.10s -> 4085.78s]  Hey before the officials got there they said. Okay
[4085.78s -> 4089.86s]  drive this way I'll show you how to get there. Oh thank you friend.
[4089.86s -> 4094.97s]  Have a drink Sean. Do I have to hand him a drink?
[4094.97s -> 4100.81s]  All right I'm gonna with both hands as hard as I can grab his ankles
[4100.81s -> 4104.33s]  and pull him as hard as I can through here.
[4104.33s -> 4109.48s]  You've got a country you've got here. I'm not as fine as Connemara but fine
[4109.48s -> 4113.88s]  nonetheless. My people come from Scott.
[4113.88s -> 4118.44s]  Ted you and I are nearly brothers.
[4120.04s -> 4126.98s]  I'm kind of jealous. I feel like I belong up there to laugh and talk.
[4126.98s -> 4130.58s]  Just over here. Yeah straight down the path here.
[4130.58s -> 4134.42s]  It's getting so I can barely keep track of all these deliveries coming in.
[4134.42s -> 4137.62s]  Yeah and they said they was looking for more drivers in town.
[4137.70s -> 4142.26s]  I jumped at that chance. I never been there to kick a bit of honest work out
[4142.26s -> 4145.70s]  of bed. Is he floating? You folks been
[4145.70s -> 4149.94s]  having a hard time of it have you? Yeah Mr Gray's got a heap of problems
[4149.94s -> 4151.70s]  right now with another family around here.
[4151.70s -> 4155.70s]  No he's not. Much covetous lowdowns trying to sabotage his life here.
[4155.70s -> 4160.34s]  Disgusting. Oh dear oh dear I'm sorry to hear that Hamish.
[4160.34s -> 4163.78s]  Sounds like you definitely deserve that drink. No I'm not gonna
[4163.78s -> 4168.26s]  What are you talking about? Just in there.
[4168.26s -> 4180.25s]  Right you are. You can unload it here.
[4180.25s -> 4187.13s]  In here? The horse is like a swift one. Am I just gonna be in here?
[4187.13s -> 4191.11s]  Nothing. It's grand. Am I gonna have to
[4191.11s -> 4193.59s]  jump out and jump scare this guy and punch him in the face or something? How
[4193.59s -> 4199.91s]  does this not work? Quite a place you boys have got here.
[4199.91s -> 4204.07s]  Reminds me one of them big houses out in Dunnegal.
[4204.15s -> 4209.83s]  Real fancy places they was Hamish. Real fancy because if some folks got all
[4209.83s -> 4212.79s]  the money they can build quite the fanciest
[4212.79s -> 4217.27s]  places in the world. Well the average man subs on
[4217.27s -> 4221.99s]  shy yeah yeah yeah okay.
[4224.55s -> 4235.90s]  Take his hat. How you getting on? Good.
[4235.98s -> 4242.36s]  You already got these things ready. Okay.
[4242.92s -> 4248.06s]  It seemed like the quickest way. There's plenty of guards out there.
[4248.06s -> 4252.46s]  Here's how I feel. Should have shot him with a shotgun. No that's too much.
[4252.46s -> 4256.44s]  You head over to the dry barn. Sure. And you?
[4256.44s -> 4263.45s]  I'll deal with the fields themselves. We coat everything in moonshine and then we
[4263.45s -> 4266.49s]  light things up with these little fellers here.
[4266.49s -> 4270.33s]  Thankfully it ain't rain and that old barn over there should go up like a
[4270.33s -> 4272.81s]  torch. How many of these boys you think you
[4272.81s -> 4277.53s]  need? They should do it. Let's head out.
[4277.53s -> 4282.30s]  That'll do it. Look once they get wind of us
[4282.30s -> 4286.38s]  there'll be no turning back so move quickly. Of course.
[4286.38s -> 4290.54s]  I'm rebel stock boy. I was barb burning down manor houses.
[4290.54s -> 4295.34s]  Burn quietly. All right so we're gonna
[4295.34s -> 4298.38s]  torch the fields.
[4319.42s -> 4323.10s]  Sneak around. Which way are we going? Am I in his way?
[4323.10s -> 4328.44s]  I'm not fucking up his AI right?
[4333.08s -> 4336.20s]  Make him drink the moonshine.
[4336.20s -> 4348.79s]  You might as well take a sip right?
[4357.35s -> 4368.81s]  Were they? Were they? Were they alerted?
[4368.81s -> 4372.23s]  Quiet. There's someone coming on the left. Yeah and that guy's
[4372.23s -> 4387.59s]  god damn it. That noise. That was fucking loud.
[4387.59s -> 4392.81s]  This one didn't. Strange. But you got there.
[4392.81s -> 4399.08s]  Tools. Payroll. Okay. Payroll. That's the magic word there. Payroll.
[4399.08s -> 4403.61s]  Sure. See you later. You hear that? Payroll.
[4403.77s -> 4408.60s]  Yeah. Let's get this job done first okay?
[4408.60s -> 4414.94s]  I'll take care of this fella. No I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna do it again.
[4414.94s -> 4419.66s]  Joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. No I'm just kidding.
[4419.66s -> 4421.02s]  We'll be at the barn when you're done.
[4421.02s -> 4431.38s]  Going down fields will pull on it. We want chitchat.
[4431.38s -> 4441.21s]  We want shipping. Will you let me do this? He's not gonna let me do it.
[4441.21s -> 4443.61s]  When hiding among tobacco plants guards will not be able to see you as
[4443.61s -> 4447.64s]  easily. Okay how much do I have to pour?
[4447.64s -> 4461.61s]  All right that's good. Where is that guy facing?
[4461.61s -> 4467.48s]  Well he's facing this way. I'm gonna wait till he turns around.
[4467.48s -> 4475.26s]  Or will he turn around? Turn up the game volume?
[4475.26s -> 4485.03s]  Is he gonna just look over here the whole time? A lot of moonshine in here
[4485.03s -> 4490.10s]  apparently.
[4490.50s -> 4494.66s]  Okay yeah you just have to do it until he says he's satisfied.
[4494.66s -> 4498.58s]  So I'm gonna go across. Oh dear. Oh dear.
[4498.58s -> 4502.26s]  Okay this guy facing this way. Not for now.
[4502.26s -> 4510.22s]  I'm gonna wait till he crosses back again. This is the only guy that I need to
[4510.22s -> 4521.78s]  worry about. On this side at least. Okay.
[4521.78s -> 4545.24s]  Dump it. Music is dying. Angry goat music.
[4545.24s -> 4549.40s]  I gotta go across that way. I wonder if you
[4549.40s -> 4560.78s]  turn around. Probably. Not really. I could go to the left.
[4560.78s -> 4569.08s]  Or uh no I'm not gonna go now. Once he comes back this way I think he can
[4569.08s -> 4580.60s]  make it. Turn turn turn. Turn before it's too
[4580.60s -> 4594.38s]  late. Thank you. All right. Cause a problem over
[4594.38s -> 4599.42s]  here too. Turn up the mic. Who's mic? My mic?
[4599.42s -> 4617.99s]  That should do it. Long mission huh? One more on the other side.
[4617.99s -> 4624.50s]  Anybody else looking over here? Or can I just go right behind him right now?
[4624.50s -> 4628.71s]  Pretty sure I can get behind him right now. Yeah. It's gonna be a long
[4628.71s -> 4643.53s]  It's not something something Far Cry 3. Barn. I should be able to
[4643.53s -> 4653.13s]  wrap around. Should I go for it? It's uh no no. Should I go for it?
[4653.13s -> 4660.60s]  No he's gonna turn. He's gonna turn. I'm gonna get seen when he turns.
[4660.60s -> 4665.80s]  I coulda gone. No I couldn't. Do it you wuss. No I don't want to do this mission
[4665.80s -> 4668.84s]  again. I don't want to fail this. I'm gonna
[4668.84s -> 4685.64s]  have to go around him. Actually maybe not. I'm gonna just go
[4685.64s -> 4700.66s]  this way. Yeah. Just go wrap around now. Right
[4700.66s -> 4718.42s]  down there. There's no more guards around here right? Am I?
[4718.42s -> 4727.69s]  Nice. This a quick dowsing as well. Dowsing the guy? Just the guy.
[4727.69s -> 4746.18s]  Thanks you go Arthur. You too. Let's get out. Would you look at that.
[4746.18s -> 4753.21s]  Yeah well let's go loot yourselves a fat cigar.
[4753.21s -> 4767.96s]  Did we get it? Okay we got it. You almost ran into the field.
[4767.96s -> 4771.38s]  I did almost run into the field. You are correct.
[4771.38s -> 4825.62s]  We lost the horses. Uh okay apparently the horses are gone.
[4825.62s -> 4839.48s]  I'm right next to you.
[4857.78s -> 4861.46s]  Forehead yeah. Right in the forehead.
[4861.46s -> 4872.92s]  Now this is really cool though. It's uh interesting.
[4872.92s -> 4886.58s]  It is kind of hey get out and shoot the bad guys.
[4886.58s -> 4890.02s]  I was about to shoot a bad horse.
[4902.92s -> 4910.39s]  We did good. Let's go. Let's go. Looky here you get them horses free marker.
[4910.39s -> 4918.97s]  The horse is free. The horse is free. The horse is not free.
[4918.97s -> 4929.78s]  Free. Let's get the hell out of here. I'm just getting thrown off.
[4929.78s -> 4933.22s]  Right in the fire. I know I would probably absolutely do it.
[4933.22s -> 4952.14s]  Gotta leave them. Leave them. Straight out the main gate. Come on.
[4952.14s -> 4963.06s]  Oh we don't have to jump over those. Wow.
[4963.06s -> 4966.01s]  Wow.
[4976.04s -> 4984.42s]  At least the music is overpowering. Music's pretty good.
[4984.42s -> 5000.04s]  I think we lost them. Yeah we did. Quite a nice. I didn't read the whole
[5000.04s -> 5002.84s]  thing. What was the whole thing? The rest of the fight don't just put us
[5002.84s -> 5007.00s]  into the middle of here. I hope him and Jose are riding it.
[5007.00s -> 5011.26s]  There's some money at the end of it. What now?
[5011.26s -> 5015.10s]  Head on back to camp. It's loud. You coming?
[5015.10s -> 5022.09s]  Um yeah. Sure.
[5028.04s -> 5035.51s]  Turn the mic up. My my mic is currently uh actually it's funny you
[5035.51s -> 5040.71s]  say that because I am investing in a new
[5040.75s -> 5048.22s]  uh audio system. So I will be sounding much better than I could
[5048.22s -> 5053.05s]  weaker to because I'm actually going to use a
[5053.05s -> 5059.05s]  I have a XLR device but it's not necessarily like
[5059.05s -> 5064.34s]  compressor and gain and I'm trying to I want to get one.
[5064.34s -> 5068.90s]  I'm not going to do too much to it because I just want to make the audio
[5068.90s -> 5073.30s]  cleaner and be able to change on the fly easily
[5073.30s -> 5081.11s]  how loud or soft I am. So so I'm not going to really add that
[5081.11s -> 5085.08s]  much equalization or compression so I'm not going to sound
[5085.08s -> 5091.03s]  that different. I'm just going to be able to adjust it easier.
[5091.03s -> 5094.39s]  All right so what time is it? Is it time for us to try
[5094.39s -> 5098.55s]  online again? I think it might be where you can turn the volume up. The
[5098.55s -> 5101.99s]  volume is up as loud as it can go. This device that I have this plugged
[5101.99s -> 5107.34s]  into is not the greatest. I mean it's a
[5107.66s -> 5114.82s]  Scarlett Solo so it's good but it's really really hard to use.
[5114.82s -> 5122.58s]  The thing is incredibly finicky. I think I gave everything I needed.
[5122.58s -> 5126.02s]  Well I have $3,700 though. Yeah hold on.
[5126.02s -> 5130.66s]  Let me give them some money. Do this mission first? Okay
[5130.66s -> 5147.78s]  we'll do this last mission. I'm gonna give like 300 bucks
[5147.78s -> 5159.48s]  and is there anything new in the ledger? I don't think so.
[5159.48s -> 5169.29s]  I do need more provisions though. Let's buy it all.
[5169.29s -> 5186.39s]  Buy it all. Well I can't do anything. Everybody gives two bucks. Well I'm gonna
[5186.39s -> 5194.17s]  give more than that. Hey Dutch you uh you decent in there?
[5194.17s -> 5199.62s]  No that's not the front of his tent. That's the back of the tent.
[5199.62s -> 5203.29s]  Whoops. Wait what? Yeah no it doesn't matter.
[5203.29s -> 5214.34s]  Open the tent up. You don't you don't want me to come in?
[5214.34s -> 5226.28s]  Sit. Should I just wait for him? Dutch?
[5226.28s -> 5239.74s]  Uh what is wrong with his arm? What is he doing?
[5242.74s -> 5254.58s]  I can't walk in. I'm drying right now. Something's wrong with him.
[5254.58s -> 5270.31s]  Take his hand. Just grab his hand. I can't do anything. All right well I'm
[5270.31s -> 5277.58s]  just gonna. I just ate something. Whatever.
[5277.58s -> 5293.03s]  Oh candy. Are you sweating yet Dutch? Of course I'm sweating.
[5293.03s -> 5297.27s]  We're in some disease ridden swampy desy whistling shithole.
[5297.27s -> 5301.19s]  I meant about what Trelawney said about. I like it. It's got candy.
[5301.19s -> 5304.63s]  Such but maybe a little gentle perspiration.
[5304.63s -> 5309.51s]  Until we know more ain't too much harm in wasting good liquor on sweating.
[5309.51s -> 5316.47s]  So? So I think you should pay Mr Trelawney a visit and find out exactly
[5316.47s -> 5322.57s]  what he knows and who he spoke to. Take Charles with you.
[5322.57s -> 5326.25s]  You got it. Or the side of the pair of you would make a statue
[5326.25s -> 5332.04s]  sing out its secrets. Okay. Go to Charles.
[5332.04s -> 5336.62s]  Hey Charles. You and I are gonna be working together here.
[5336.62s -> 5340.38s]  Like your new home? Nope. Wrong guy. I won't miss that other place that's for sure.
[5340.38s -> 5347.14s]  Hey Charles. Keep your nose clean. I need you for some business in town.
[5347.14s -> 5364.78s]  Come on. Okay. Come with me. Why does the screen keep flashing?
[5364.78s -> 5369.14s]  I don't. I don't see anything on my end.
[5369.14s -> 5376.10s]  Hopefully that's not something wrong with your computer.
[5376.10s -> 5383.74s]  Is he coming? No. Where is he? Why do I think everybody's the same
[5383.74s -> 5400.39s]  character? What? Where am I going? What? Get on the
[5400.39s -> 5411.16s]  horse. Why is my game fucking up? What?
[5411.16s -> 5430.50s]  I can't get on the horse. Okay. That was weird.
[5432.50s -> 5436.50s]  I rode too close to the camp. Well he was on a horse. We were both.
[5436.50s -> 5444.20s]  We were hitched and I was walking right next to him.
[5446.06s -> 5450.30s]  That fool of a sheriff who runs that town. I knew Dutch was gonna play him like
[5450.30s -> 5453.90s]  a fiddle. Stop yelling at me. Working for
[5453.90s -> 5457.74s]  another. Interesting. All right. Let's do it.
[5457.74s -> 5462.63s]  I'm in plain sight. Dutch calls it.
[5462.63s -> 5466.15s]  We almost sandwiched that guy. Spirits seem good.
[5466.15s -> 5470.73s]  In the new camp I mean. We got some space between us and that mess now.
[5470.73s -> 5474.95s]  Ain't she? No more picketins for a while.
[5474.95s -> 5478.31s]  Got some corn.
[5478.31s -> 5481.99s]  Dutch don't seem too worried about it. I can't believe they're still coming
[5481.99s -> 5484.31s]  after us. We didn't even get away with the
[5484.31s -> 5486.95s]  money. Yeah but they don't know. So we'll try
[5486.95s -> 5490.63s]  online again after this mission. See if we can get another uh decent
[5490.63s -> 5494.23s]  session out of it. I've only met him a couple times but he's
[5494.23s -> 5502.82s]  he's a strange one. Feed Otto. He's just a cockroach and fancy
[5503.14s -> 5507.70s]  Otto ate earlier today. Before I started streaming he ate.
[5507.70s -> 5512.42s]  We just need to find him before we add some delicious dog food.
[5512.42s -> 5521.85s]  I think it's just up here. Easy. Recognize that one with the fire
[5521.85s -> 5526.89s]  outside. Wait didn't I? I think I jumped off this roof already.
[5526.89s -> 5543.64s]  Yeah I did. Search the caravan. Well so it seems. That's not a clue
[5543.64s -> 5553.94s]  but it's hair pomade. A clue. Spilt uh somebody spilled a plant.
[5553.94s -> 5563.85s]  You see anything there? Tactatactatacitus
[5563.85s -> 5569.19s]  Kilgore Mining Company Certificate. Interesting.
[5569.19s -> 5576.74s]  What do you think? This food's barely touched.
[5576.74s -> 5580.74s]  Looks like you have to get hurry. A little draw over here.
[5580.74s -> 5586.76s]  Nothing. Can't take the snake oil. What else we got for clues?
[5587.00s -> 5591.56s]  Nothing on the well. There is something else here.
[5591.56s -> 5609.16s]  No. Bed. Bed's not made so recently. What about the sink?
[5609.16s -> 5614.52s]  Bathtub. There's some blood here. Blood and bathtub.
[5614.52s -> 5625.91s]  But no body. Look. Okay right apple. Might as well take the apple. Never
[5625.91s -> 5637.35s]  mind. Chat demands to see Otto. He's
[5637.35s -> 5640.55s]  downstairs doing his thing. I'm not gonna go hey
[5640.55s -> 5643.43s]  come here dog and I'm gonna bring you upstairs and put you in front of a
[5643.43s -> 5646.23s]  camera. No he's having a good time being a dog
[5646.23s -> 5650.82s]  downstairs.
[5656.50s -> 5669.69s]  Let's follow the track. He's sleeping on his bed down there. He's
[5669.69s -> 5674.89s]  he's happy. He's very happy down there.
[5681.06s -> 5686.84s]  They could be 20 miles away by now. We can track them that far if we get to.
[5686.84s -> 5692.86s]  I'm alone. He was in here earlier. He still ain't sure. He has a very short
[5692.86s -> 5698.06s]  attention span. He gets bored very easily. So if
[5698.06s -> 5700.94s]  he's in here with me. Oh he's lying down on a bed or a
[5700.94s -> 5704.54s]  blanket back here. Oh okay. After two hours he's just like
[5704.54s -> 5706.70s]  get me out of here. I don't want to be here. I hate this.
[5706.70s -> 5710.46s]  And I'm like all right. I let him out and he just like has like this
[5710.46s -> 5714.65s]  zoomies for a little while. He goes downstairs and he hangs out.
[5714.65s -> 5718.25s]  Maybe he gets a little snack or something.
[5718.25s -> 5744.44s]  Where the tracks go? I think the tracks lead this way.
[5744.44s -> 5752.98s]  Well that I was going the wrong way wasn't I? Well I found him.
[5752.98s -> 5760.74s]  He's just right here. Excuse me. Yeah have you seen him? We're uh
[5760.74s -> 5769.72s]  we're looking for our friend. I don't think he's here.
[5770.04s -> 5775.93s]  Have you seen a strange sort of fella? Sort of formal?
[5775.93s -> 5784.57s]  Do Otto and Midas get along yet? They do. They're good buddies. He uses a cane.
[5784.57s -> 5789.38s]  Looks a lot like this one. That guy's getting up. He's ready to throw a
[5789.38s -> 5796.54s]  punch. I want him to throw the punch first
[5796.54s -> 5822.58s]  game. Interrogate. Where is he?
[5822.58s -> 5834.23s]  He's Trelawney. I don't know anything. No. Really. Yes. You go to hell.
[5834.23s -> 5840.23s]  Tell me now you son of a bitch. Okay. Two punches I'll take.
[5840.23s -> 5843.99s]  They took him to a cabin over by the cornfields.
[5843.99s -> 5849.59s]  Which cornfields? Left. Down the path there by Braithwaite Manor. Right
[5849.59s -> 5856.25s]  there. Okay. That it? You got any more info
[5856.25s -> 5879.78s]  from me? I should do it. Choke slam him. How do I make
[5879.78s -> 5895.82s]  the horse go? Whatever. I didn't mean- I was trying to
[5895.82s -> 5905.96s]  make him like run. That guy had 25 bucks on him. All right
[5905.96s -> 5909.64s]  looking for the the path this way. I think there's a way around so we
[5909.64s -> 5911.40s]  don't have to go through the Braithwaite's place.
[5911.40s -> 5916.10s]  Okay. I'll let you leave. I've spent enough time there
[5916.10s -> 5925.02s]  after you then. I'm good. What do you think they want with Trelawney?
[5925.02s -> 5932.73s]  Could be any one of a hundred things. Just depends if any of them involve
[5933.37s -> 5936.89s]  us. You think he'll talk? Of course. You okay over there?
[5936.89s -> 5940.41s]  I'm good. Tell his own sister to save a train fare.
[5940.41s -> 5948.34s]  He don't know how- He don't know. At least I don't think he does.
[5948.34s -> 5953.03s]  I don't know if he still deals with him. Always disappearing for weeks on end.
[5953.03s -> 5960.49s]  He's got his uses. Well loyalty matters to Dutch. Of course.
[5960.49s -> 5964.81s]  Dutch Vanderlin. Let me tell you boys something.
[5964.81s -> 5972.15s]  It's Dutch Vanderlin's voice. Nobody can do that voice.
[5972.15s -> 5979.29s]  He has the most distinct voice I've ever heard.
[5979.29s -> 5992.52s]  It's so deep. It's so distinct. I have a plan. No. I have a plan.
[5992.52s -> 5997.58s]  I have to be four or five octaves lower.
[6000.78s -> 6003.90s]  But the one thing about Dutch that's interesting is when he yells
[6003.90s -> 6010.46s]  he goes from this to- It's actually really funny. He's like now you get
[6010.46s -> 6020.68s]  those boys out of here and bring them to the other side.
[6020.68s -> 6032.73s]  I love it. It's so real. His voice just
[6032.73s -> 6036.97s]  breaks when he gets to a certain amount of power behind it.
[6036.97s -> 6046.97s]  His voice is too powerful. I love Dutch's voice so much.
[6046.97s -> 6058.17s]  If only I was that talented. When are we trying online again after this
[6058.17s -> 6062.26s]  mission? After this mission I'm gonna go take
[6062.26s -> 6068.52s]  a bathroom break and then after that
[6068.52s -> 6071.72s]  we'll try online see if we can get it to work. Another hour or two maybe and see
[6071.72s -> 6074.60s]  where we are.
[6074.60s -> 6077.80s]  This will be remembered like a good time.
[6093.37s -> 6101.58s]  Why don't I take the horse? No horse.
[6103.90s -> 6109.56s]  Should I shoot? Look and listen for disturbances in the cornfields.
[6109.64s -> 6112.44s]  Disturbances- I gotta look for a disturbance in the forest. Wait what's
[6112.44s -> 6118.71s]  this? What was that blip on the map that was
[6118.71s -> 6131.53s]  right here? What was it showing me? He's like go that- oh right here right
[6131.53s -> 6143.19s]  here. Thanks for being the- what do I do
[6143.19s -> 6155.86s]  with them? Set it? Do it. I gotta find the other
[6155.86s -> 6159.96s]  guy.
[6160.76s -> 6178.36s]  I saw the blip over here. Got him. Almost.
[6178.36s -> 6201.43s]  Close. To the birds. Birds? Down here?
[6201.43s -> 6231.30s]  That way Arthur! Idiot hat tunnel vision. Wait was it- we supposed to do this
[6231.30s -> 6237.70s]  together? No. Okay. He dumped his gear. He's
[6237.70s -> 6248.15s]  somewhere around here. He's dumped it. Where the fuck were you?
[6248.15s -> 6251.94s]  Okay. This is scripted.
[6252.26s -> 6258.68s]  Let me take him. Get out of here. He's not your friend.
[6258.68s -> 6267.74s]  I'll give you money. Be quiet. Ooh. Nice. That was a good toss.
[6267.74s -> 6271.82s]  Come on. You should have taken the money.
[6271.82s -> 6284.50s]  I'm a fool. Oh shit. Thank you. Of course. You okay? Yeah.
[6284.50s -> 6292.15s]  Fine. Charles that was pretty- that's pretty godlike.
[6292.15s -> 6316.26s]  How can they see us here? That was a warning shot.
[6316.26s -> 6320.98s]  They sense the disturbance in the corn. All right. I gotta put on the-
[6320.98s -> 6341.54s]  Let's go to the school fields. That works.
[6341.54s -> 6346.36s]  Let's go back for Trelawney. You all right?
[6346.36s -> 6352.46s]  That was easy, does it? Sure don't. Come on.
[6352.46s -> 6356.14s]  Let's go see how badly they beat up the slippery feller.
[6356.14s -> 6359.64s]  Wonder how much trouble he's brought with him.
[6360.60s -> 6363.96s]  Is that a good gun on the ground?
[6368.44s -> 6372.02s]  I'm gonna take a look at the gun on the ground.
[6372.02s -> 6391.34s]  It's good. I'm gonna take it. What is it? Rare? Whoa.
[6391.34s -> 6402.20s]  Rare. I saw rare. Lancaster Peter for rare
[6402.20s -> 6418.17s]  rolling rock- rolling block rifle. Rare. Okay. Don't I have
[6419.05s -> 6425.51s]  I'll have a bolt action. Well that's kind of cool.
[6425.51s -> 6435.75s]  Let me see it. Can we just get Trelawney and go?
[6435.75s -> 6448.55s]  It's engraved too. Weapon's clean. Well
[6448.55s -> 6463.03s]  that's pretty neat. I have to go- I gotta go put this-
[6463.03s -> 6471.77s]  upgrade this and get this all decked out, you know. Through the corn.
[6471.77s -> 6477.80s]  Do you need to get on my horse or you got a horse right?
[6477.80s -> 6483.64s]  Tactical engraving. Oh you can't with rares. Okay.
[6483.64s -> 6496.55s]  Mr Trelawney, where are you? You okay? So who was they? They were bounty
[6496.55s -> 6500.63s]  hunters. Attached to Cole Stoddermont. I remember
[6500.63s -> 6505.11s]  this guy. They weren't looking for me
[6505.11s -> 6509.08s]  per se. What'd you tell them? Not much.
[6509.08s -> 6515.48s]  I told them I was an intellectual. Come down here from Oregon.
[6515.48s -> 6523.82s]  Good job at the universe. Of course, they didn't believe me. Seems
[6523.82s -> 6527.34s]  you stirred up quite a hornet's nest in Blackwater. He made the reference?
[6527.34s -> 6530.86s]  Metal Gear stream? What do you mean Metal Gear? It might be best if I stay with you
[6530.86s -> 6535.02s]  gentlemen for a while. Can't go back to that caravan now.
[6535.02s -> 6538.70s]  All right Charles, you take Trelawney back to camp. I'll catch up with
[6538.70s -> 6547.22s]  you. Okay. Looks dumb and thick.
[6547.22s -> 6553.22s]  Bounty hunters. Inkerton's law man. Is chapter three incoming here?
[6553.22s -> 6566.65s]  More. Perhaps this is it now. We shall see I guess.
[6566.65s -> 6573.50s]  So we're still pretending to be, we are still pretending to be
[6573.50s -> 6581.38s]  law men. Okay so we are at the five hour mark of the stream. We gave
[6581.38s -> 6583.30s]  about two through about just about an hour
[6583.30s -> 6586.34s]  and a half in single player. Let's see if it was
[6586.34s -> 6588.42s]  enough. I'm gonna grab a drink. I'll be
[6588.42s -> 6591.80s]  right back. We're going to try to open up multiplayer again.
[6591.80s -> 6596.71s]  I'll see you in two minutes.
