[8.25s -> 21.38s]  This is gonna be fun. Uh, find the video game. No, what are you doing? My PS, my PS is fucked.
[21.38s -> 36.63s]  I don't know where it is. This is not, this is bad. Where is, I'm never liking. There it is.
[39.61s -> 46.38s]  Where'd the cam go? I turned it off. Boo boo boo, Jeremy you stink, Jeremy you stink.
[47.10s -> 54.71s]  So those of you that don't know, uh, as of tomorrow, tomorrow after tomorrow's stream,
[54.71s -> 60.07s]  I'm gonna be gone for a few days. Because the Halloween stream is fairly elaborate.
[61.66s -> 72.76s]  And it's, I'm gonna be across the world setting it up. There will be three activities
[73.56s -> 84.95s]  on that stream. Not just the slime stuff. A couple others as well. Yeah, 31st exactly.
[90.58s -> 98.66s]  Dude, he's doing Siren one, two, and three in a row. No. What time is the stream gonna start?
[98.66s -> 106.78s]  Um, probably somewhere in the afternoon Eastern. I would say, this just screamed in my ear.
[107.42s -> 117.99s]  Uh, probably at some point, two, three, four o'clock. I'm gonna lock it down once I know
[117.99s -> 123.35s]  exactly what's going on. Probably around three o'clock Eastern. Between three and four I think.
[125.35s -> 127.29s]  Oh wait, my money, my money card.
[135.83s -> 141.43s]  It's probably gonna be around four, yeah, it's maybe even a little later than four depending on
[141.43s -> 144.95s]  how difficult it is to get this whole thing set up over a couple days.
[153.02s -> 163.48s]  Load. Think we're good, right? Oh this, wait, what's stage, stage five?
[165.48s -> 166.44s]  Which is the airplane one?
[168.68s -> 184.92s]  Oh no, this one breaks, this one breaks. People actually like this game? Yeah.
[184.92s -> 196.95s]  I like this game. So it's four.
[204.87s -> 208.07s]  I just, I just wanted to play this song. I don't know, I don't know why. It's a little
[208.07s -> 215.19s]  bit about just hitting triangle over and over again. He's doing it for me. Let's go.
[215.19s -> 233.72s]  Oh, this is in Siren. Yeah, I gotta update that. I've been out of practice.
[295.91s -> 302.28s]  This is crazy Siren gameplay. That makes me laugh. Sorry.
[310.18s -> 312.98s]  I got the skills to beat you and knock you out.
[343.24s -> 345.32s]  From cool to bad.
[352.44s -> 357.32s]  That was the info, but look at me, I'm learning just how to fly.
[362.28s -> 367.32s]  I'm still wondering when we get to quest. I'm hungry, I'm sleepy, don't wanna die.
[373.48s -> 375.40s]  Thought I got cool. The very end, damn it.
[375.40s -> 381.61s]  That was gooder than good. Patience. Thank you. I'm in a hurry. Need to move on.
[381.61s -> 388.63s]  This game is so fun. Let me change it to that. What was another good one?
[393.06s -> 394.26s]  There's another one that I really liked.
[397.78s -> 398.98s]  Stage two. Yeah, that was it.
[413.50s -> 416.62s]  Wait, there are more. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[416.62s -> 443.29s]  there. Stage two, Lamy Parappa team. Manual controller auto. Let's go. I broke something.
[451.46s -> 458.36s]  Wow. Look two. I got two controllers here. See?
[481.34s -> 484.14s]  Carry the equipment, buy snacks, and give us foot massage.
[485.90s -> 493.14s]  Put the PlayStation upside down. No, I don't have to do that yet. So this is, it's dual?
[497.26s -> 505.26s]  This one is hard. Okay, so Lamy controller one. Oh, this song is awesome. Okay, here we go.
[505.26s -> 515.66s]  Let's get on, let's get on. Who's doing this? This has been my long desire. This has been my long
[515.66s -> 525.42s]  desire. Baby, you gotta pull it out quick. Bring it down without a doubt. Bring it down without a doubt.
[526.06s -> 529.58s]  Oh,
[541.91s -> 549.21s]  yeah.
[588.81s -> 597.82s]  Are we stealing points?
[597.82s -> 606.07s]  Mike, you better not go down too tight and get ready for the fire.
[609.35s -> 623.06s]  Push the button and just pull the chain and I'm comfortable.
[623.06s -> 625.06s]  I'm gonna get stuck.
[625.06s -> 627.06s]  You can tell Catherine I am.
[627.06s -> 634.49s]  What the fuck?
[634.49s -> 636.49s]  This is, uh, Lamy Parappa.
[636.49s -> 662.26s]  This is the last.
[662.26s -> 664.26s]  Forever?
[664.26s -> 667.27s]  I'm not a liar.
[667.43s -> 675.74s]  Who won?
[675.74s -> 679.13s]  Okay, that was pretty through now.
[679.13s -> 681.13s]  Okay. Oh, yeah.
[681.13s -> 683.93s]  Is there any more Parappa levels? Like that I can just do? Parappa levels?
[685.93s -> 687.93s]  Is it just one?
[692.41s -> 707.16s]  Oh, I remember I got, uh, the game fucked up here.
[708.44s -> 711.70s]  Stage two Lamy Ramy battle.
[715.51s -> 726.68s]  Auto level. I need to do this so I want to do the other Parappa levels.
[726.68s -> 732.17s]  Holy shit, what is going on here? Auto assemble player.
[735.86s -> 740.15s]  I remember this broke. Let's do auto.
[740.15s -> 745.11s]  All right, let's do stage, I don't know, stage two, stage four versus, uh, AI.
[747.03s -> 749.03s]  Let's go.
[752.01s -> 754.01s]  It won't break in two player.
[754.73s -> 756.73s]  But then I have to, like, switch controls and that's annoying.
[758.49s -> 760.49s]  Oh, right, it's this awesome, cool song.
[762.57s -> 764.57s]  I just did this one, but I like this one.
[769.11s -> 771.11s]  Oh, that's my first, that's my alter ego.
[772.23s -> 774.23s]  Never give it up, soldier.
[776.23s -> 778.23s]  Take this one, put it on the track, show what you got, soldier.
[782.23s -> 784.23s]  That was awful.
[799.19s -> 803.86s]  How do you do that?
[803.86s -> 805.86s]  That was dumb.
[815.26s -> 817.26s]  I'm good.
[817.26s -> 819.26s]  It's always my brain.
[819.26s -> 822.25s]  Take this one, put it on the track, show what you got, soldier.
[826.60s -> 828.60s]  Still ahead.
[828.60s -> 832.50s]  I got a few notes there.
[832.50s -> 834.50s]  Take this one, put it on the track, show what you got, soldier.
[834.50s -> 837.83s]  That's gonna be cool. What if I get cool as a twin?
[841.83s -> 843.83s]  Now it's time to move on.
[843.83s -> 845.83s]  It only gets much harder, so carry on.
[847.83s -> 855.13s]  Think I'm bold now.
[855.13s -> 857.13s]  I got the skills to beat you and knock you out.
[859.13s -> 865.78s]  He's a sparrows.
[865.78s -> 867.78s]  It's always my brain.
[867.78s -> 869.78s]  Roll rock, clap and scream it.
[876.76s -> 878.76s]  I want my sheets.
[880.76s -> 883.13s]  We got to zero points.
[883.13s -> 885.13s]  You lose.
[885.13s -> 889.80s]  I just got super insane.
[889.80s -> 891.80s]  Insane.
[891.80s -> 893.80s]  Like, I've heard that exact voice.
[893.80s -> 895.80s]  Then Lemmy just said
[895.80s -> 897.80s]  Total Distortion.
[897.80s -> 899.80s]  Total Distortion is one of the people you sell videos to.
[905.80s -> 907.80s]  Yep.
[907.80s -> 910.23s]  That was weird.
[910.23s -> 912.86s]  I want to do the Parappa shit.
[912.86s -> 914.86s]  I want to do the Parappa levels that I haven't done.
[916.86s -> 919.61s]  Lemmy and Parappa team.
[919.61s -> 921.61s]  I'll just do auto. No, but I want to do that.
[921.61s -> 928.14s]  You think I can get through this without it breaking?
[928.14s -> 931.34s]  Let's see what happens.
[931.34s -> 933.34s]  It's had like four days to rest.
[933.34s -> 935.34s]  I've got to get in a different category.
[959.90s -> 961.90s]  I've got to get cool on this and stay on cool.
[961.90s -> 963.90s]  Sound of the alarm work.
[963.90s -> 971.77s]  Alright, let's try to get this thing.
[971.77s -> 982.46s]  That was good.
[982.46s -> 985.91s]  That was good.
[1005.61s -> 1010.28s]  That wasn't even bad.
[1010.28s -> 1012.28s]  I could hardly hear him.
[1012.28s -> 1014.28s]  He's like speaking through a wall.
[1024.22s -> 1026.22s]  I'm getting some crazy here.
[1058.50s -> 1060.50s]  Tool.
[1060.50s -> 1065.85s]  Boy, break the game.
[1091.72s -> 1144.71s]  I can actually do the other Parappa levels that we didn't see because the disc would break.
[1144.71s -> 1146.71s]  Don't ask me how this got fixed.
[1146.71s -> 1149.14s]  I have no idea.
[1153.54s -> 1155.54s]  He was just splitting the screen the whole time.
[1157.54s -> 1159.54s]  So now, what's level two?
[1159.54s -> 1161.54s]  I don't know.
[1161.54s -> 1164.62s]  I have no idea.
[1164.62s -> 1168.84s]  He was just splitting the screen the whole time.
[1170.84s -> 1177.16s]  So now,
[1177.16s -> 1179.16s]  what's level two?
[1179.16s -> 1181.16s]  I don't know how this got fixed.
[1185.45s -> 1187.45s]  I changed the disc speed.
[1190.14s -> 1192.14s]  Don't hold your breath though.
[1192.14s -> 1194.14s]  It might happen right now.
[1213.08s -> 1217.08s]  You played an entire whole game about how you want to eat wheat.
[1217.08s -> 1219.08s]  The whole noodles thing.
[1219.08s -> 1222.73s]  I thought I got stuck.
[1226.73s -> 1243.10s]  Shit.
[1243.10s -> 1247.96s]  It's the baby level, isn't it?
[1247.96s -> 1257.30s]  Why is it always the baby?
[1257.30s -> 1259.48s]  It's just above the disc.
[1259.48s -> 1263.19s]  I'm not putting the PlayStation upside down.
[1263.19s -> 1265.19s]  It's in the PS2 right now.
[1265.19s -> 1269.54s]  That'll break it.
[1269.54s -> 1276.97s]  I'm going to try to skip the cutscene.
[1276.97s -> 1287.77s]  That shit again.
[1287.77s -> 1289.77s]  Put it on its side.
[1289.77s -> 1292.65s]  I'll do that.
[1292.65s -> 1294.65s]  See if that fixes it.
[1294.65s -> 1296.65s]  It's on its side.
[1296.65s -> 1303.62s]  Toothpaste on disc.
[1303.62s -> 1305.93s]  No, I'm looking forward to
[1305.93s -> 1308.17s]  Jackbox tomorrow, to be honest.
[1308.17s -> 1310.17s]  That should be a lot of fun before I leave.
[1310.17s -> 1312.17s]  Because it's all new stuff, right?
[1312.17s -> 1319.66s]  I haven't used the toothpaste trick in forever.
[1319.66s -> 1321.66s]  I actually brought up the toothpaste thing
[1321.66s -> 1323.66s]  and everybody yelled at me.
[1323.66s -> 1325.66s]  They said, don't do that. That's a bad idea.
[1325.66s -> 1327.66s]  I was like, what's going on?
[1327.66s -> 1329.66s]  I thought it worked.
[1333.66s -> 1336.22s]  It actually works.
[1336.22s -> 1338.22s]  Fixed my melee disc.
[1338.22s -> 1340.58s]  Yeah, you told me I was wrong.
[1340.58s -> 1348.46s]  Okay, here we go.
[1348.46s -> 1350.46s]  Let's see if I can do this.
[1350.46s -> 1354.04s]  Skip the loading
[1354.04s -> 1356.04s]  and just see if we can get to the game.
[1358.41s -> 1371.14s]  Shit.
[1371.14s -> 1375.18s]  That's a rest.
[1375.18s -> 1377.18s]  That's a rip. That is a rest in peace here.
[1377.18s -> 1380.57s]  Damn it.
[1380.57s -> 1383.00s]  It's all good.
[1383.00s -> 1397.14s]  At least I get to play the airplane level one more time.
[1397.14s -> 1401.50s]  TS1's got the better laser.
[1401.50s -> 1403.80s]  Do I really want to do that?
[1403.80s -> 1409.30s]  I don't know. Do I really want to?
[1409.30s -> 1429.45s]  Alright, hold on.
[1429.45s -> 1433.03s]  Yes.
[1433.03s -> 1436.81s]  He's motivated.
[1436.81s -> 1440.46s]  I don't want to see
[1440.46s -> 1444.42s]  what's there.
[1444.42s -> 1446.42s]  I'm interested to see what
[1446.42s -> 1448.79s]  the actual other Parappa levels are.
[1450.79s -> 1452.79s]  When am I going to go back to do this again?
[1452.79s -> 1455.10s]  Probably never.
[1455.10s -> 1460.73s]  This is probably the last time.
[1460.73s -> 1462.73s]  One of the last times you're going to see
[1462.73s -> 1464.73s]  the PlayStation 1
[1464.73s -> 1466.73s]  even turned on.
[1466.73s -> 1469.48s]  There's still a few
[1469.48s -> 1471.85s]  things that I want to do.
[1471.85s -> 1474.09s]  But we've done a lot.
[1474.09s -> 1477.61s]  There's a lot that I'm forgetting.
[1477.61s -> 1479.61s]  But for the most part,
[1479.61s -> 1481.61s]  maybe this might be one of the last times
[1481.61s -> 1484.87s]  you see it.
[1484.87s -> 1492.36s]  Never say never. We'll see.
[1492.36s -> 1497.22s]  Alright, let's see if we can get through this.
[1513.29s -> 1517.00s]  That's a great sound.
[1517.00s -> 1525.06s]  What happened to the startup sound?
[1525.06s -> 1528.97s]  PS4 doesn't really have one.
[1528.97s -> 1531.78s]  I mean, kind of.
[1531.78s -> 1533.78s]  It's more of like a...
[1533.78s -> 1535.78s]  What is it?
[1535.78s -> 1543.98s]  You know you don't know what...
[1543.98s -> 1545.98s]  This is bright as...
[1545.98s -> 1547.98s]  Why does this brighten up?
[1547.98s -> 1550.60s]  This is really bright.
[1550.60s -> 1560.78s]  Alright, I'm just going to skip the cutscene.
[1560.78s -> 1578.74s]  New content.
[1578.74s -> 1602.87s]  Let's go.
[1602.87s -> 1604.87s]  I win?
[1639.22s -> 1641.22s]  I think I'm wet.
[1641.22s -> 1643.22s]  I think you're wet.
[1643.22s -> 1645.22s]  I think you're neck.
[1645.22s -> 1647.22s]  I think I'm neck.
[1647.22s -> 1649.22s]  I need to go, you know.
[1649.22s -> 1651.22s]  I need to go, you know.
[1651.22s -> 1653.22s]  Can't hold much longer, you know.
[1653.22s -> 1655.22s]  Are you the person who's never ever ever ever?
[1655.22s -> 1657.22s]  Are you the person who's never ever ever ever?
[1657.22s -> 1659.22s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1659.22s -> 1661.22s]  Mama, mama, mama, mama.
[1661.22s -> 1663.22s]  Now put these kids to sleep, will ya?
[1663.22s -> 1665.22s]  Now put these kids to sleep, will ya?
[1665.22s -> 1667.22s]  Hey, hey, papa, don't you think I'm good?
[1667.22s -> 1669.22s]  Hey, hey, papa, don't you think I'm good?
[1669.22s -> 1671.22s]  Now, can I please have my chicken?
[1671.22s -> 1673.66s]  Now, can I please have my food?
[1673.66s -> 1675.66s]  Now, can I please have my food?
[1675.66s -> 1678.66s]  How do you get cool on this one?
[1678.66s -> 1684.17s]  These kids to sleep, will ya?
[1684.17s -> 1686.17s]  Papa makes a sound, can...
[1686.17s -> 1694.68s]  Mama, can I have the food?
[1694.68s -> 1701.27s]  This is freaking me out because...
[1701.27s -> 1703.27s]  This is freaking me out because...
[1703.27s -> 1705.27s]  This is that Papa song.
[1705.27s -> 1709.62s]  This is that Papa song.
[1709.62s -> 1711.62s]  What is it? I'll get it this time.
[1711.62s -> 1714.12s]  I'm going to get cool right now.
[1714.12s -> 1716.12s]  What is it? I'll get it this time.
[1716.12s -> 1721.43s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1721.43s -> 1728.33s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1728.33s -> 1730.33s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1730.33s -> 1735.50s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1735.50s -> 1738.44s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1738.44s -> 1740.44s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1740.44s -> 1742.44s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1742.44s -> 1744.44s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1744.44s -> 1746.44s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1746.44s -> 1748.44s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1748.44s -> 1759.06s]  Papa, papa, papa, papa...
[1759.06s -> 1760.18s]  Mama!
[1760.18s -> 1766.20s]  Mama, can I have the food?
[1766.20s -> 1769.08s]  Mama, mama, mama.
[1769.08s -> 1774.44s]  Chicken, no, chicken, no, no, no.
[1774.44s -> 1776.44s]  I'm for a Women'seled chicken, ba-ba-ba-ba.
[1776.44s -> 1806.44s]  Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
[1806.44s -> 1809.04s]  Mama can I have a body toy? Mama can I have a body toy?
[1809.04s -> 1811.54s]  Mama can I have a body toy? Mama can I have a body toy?
[1811.54s -> 1862.58s]  Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
[1862.58s -> 1863.28s]  Next level!
[1864.04s -> 1866.42s]  This is extra sacred fucking content.
[1866.70s -> 1867.88s]  This is secret.
[1868.02s -> 1868.44s]  ...
[1873.43s -> 1878.93s]  Rapa, please don't hold the baby like that.
[1879.65s -> 1880.31s]  Skip it!
[1880.69s -> 1881.09s]  ...
[1881.09s -> 1882.05s]  Skip it! I don't care.
[1882.51s -> 1883.65s]  I'm sorry, we have to skip it.
[1883.65s -> 1884.91s]  I don't, I'm not getting locked out here.
[1885.83s -> 1886.83s]  It's the airplane one.
[1888.85s -> 1895.31s]  Come on!
[1895.33s -> 1918.07s]  Same as last time, yeah.
[1918.77s -> 1920.77s]  The Playstation 2 plays the airplane level.
[1922.31s -> 1940.23s]  Switch back and forth, that's what we did last time.
[1940.41s -> 1941.85s]  And it was a pain in the ass.
[1941.97s -> 1966.91s]  Although, they're both right here now, so...
[1966.91s -> 1981.24s]  Pokemon doesn't understand technology. He doesn't get it. He doesn't know what he's doing.
[1981.24s -> 1990.63s]  What does this plug into?
[1990.63s -> 1992.93s]  We'll plug this in, without the laptop.
[1992.93s -> 1993.93s]  Who did this?
[1993.93s -> 1994.93s]  Why is this here?
[1994.93s -> 1996.93s]  Why is there a printer on the floor?
[1996.93s -> 1998.93s]  These are all very important questions.
[1998.93s -> 2001.93s]  Why is there a printer on the floor?
[2001.93s -> 2005.60s]  I did this.
[2005.60s -> 2012.22s]  Oops.
[2012.22s -> 2015.22s]  That was a full drink. Fuck it. Who cares?
[2015.22s -> 2023.76s]  Here we go!
[2023.76s -> 2030.48s]  Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba.
[2030.48s -> 2033.78s]  Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba.
[2033.78s -> 2037.00s]  Ba ba!
[2037.00s -> 2048.97s]  Use a coaster?
[2048.97s -> 2051.34s]  Oh, I use a coaster. Absolutely.
[2051.34s -> 2053.34s]  This is actually a pretty nice desk.
[2053.34s -> 2063.81s]  Use burrito blade 2 as a coaster.
[2063.81s -> 2067.40s]  That's not gonna happen.
[2067.40s -> 2076.29s]  Why would you want me to do that?
[2076.29s -> 2079.29s]  All the games that you've seen tonight have been worth playing.
[2079.29s -> 2084.54s]  You know what I'm saying?
[2084.54s -> 2087.12s]  Don't skip it this time.
[2087.12s -> 2089.12s]  Oh, I'm gonna skip it.
[2089.12s -> 2092.71s]  I'm gonna skip it as fast as I can.
[2093.71s -> 2099.51s]  Something bright this time.
[2099.51s -> 2113.33s]  Nice.
[2124.90s -> 2130.08s]  Just like it normally does.
[2130.08s -> 2132.08s]  Different kind of song, too.
[2132.08s -> 2134.08s]  Not as fast.
[2134.08s -> 2139.16s]  I dig it.
[2139.16s -> 2141.34s]  Set up the lights, turn on the lights.
[2141.34s -> 2142.34s]  Fasten the seatbelts for the fight.
[2142.34s -> 2144.34s]  Set up the lights, turn on the lights.
[2144.34s -> 2145.34s]  Fasten your seatbelts for the fight.
[2145.34s -> 2146.34s]  Get up in the morning, run on the track.
[2146.34s -> 2148.34s]  Show me what you got, soldier.
[2148.34s -> 2149.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up, run on the track.
[2149.34s -> 2150.34s]  For the morning, get up for the morning.
[2150.34s -> 2151.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2151.34s -> 2152.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2152.34s -> 2153.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2153.34s -> 2154.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2154.34s -> 2155.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2155.34s -> 2156.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2156.34s -> 2157.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2157.34s -> 2158.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2158.34s -> 2159.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2159.34s -> 2160.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2160.34s -> 2161.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2161.34s -> 2162.34s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2162.34s -> 2163.34s]  All right, Mom.
[2163.34s -> 2164.71s]  Fine.
[2164.71s -> 2165.71s]  Run on the track, run on the track.
[2165.71s -> 2166.71s]  Show me what you got, soldier.
[2166.71s -> 2167.71s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2167.71s -> 2174.19s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2174.19s -> 2183.13s]  Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.
[2183.13s -> 2193.84s]  Get up for the morning, you must be bored.
[2193.84s -> 2197.58s]  Me?
[2197.58s -> 2200.18s]  Run run on the track.
[2200.18s -> 2202.18s]  get up for the morning, show me what you got, get up for the morning
[2217.34s -> 2221.05s]  what's happened the last time?
[2221.05s -> 2223.23s]  he just got hit in the head
[2234.76s -> 2240.48s]  I thought that milk was shit
[2240.48s -> 2242.48s]  this plane is going down
[2244.80s -> 2247.42s]  Come on
[2287.71s -> 2312.09s]  Thanks for watching the stream everybody, it was fun. Let's see if I can do this blindfold
[2313.03s -> 2318.27s]  No, that's not I'm gonna hit loads the first part is it?
[2318.27s -> 2323.86s]  Upside down
[2359.06s -> 2361.06s]  Oh
[2372.86s -> 2377.39s]  Hit me with it what hit me with it hit me with it
[2417.10s -> 2421.26s]  Came up
[2436.45s -> 2443.57s]  Yeah, thanks put the disk in upside down and then I break my
[2444.69s -> 2451.94s]  $44 PlayStation 2 you can get a digital version of dumbjammer. Lamy. How?
[2452.58s -> 2457.96s]  Is it it's not on PSN. Is it on like the PlayStation 3 PSN?
[2458.52s -> 2468.58s]  Well, I know I can emulate it, but I bought the disk thinking it was gonna fucking run in the system
[2468.90s -> 2486.96s]  Just play the thing for 15 seconds and you can buy a new one. Well, I like playing on original hardware
[2487.36s -> 2490.43s]  All right, that's gonna be it for tonight
[2490.67s -> 2499.15s]  If you bought the actual game already, you shouldn't worry about emulating it. No, but I have to get the control. I feel like alright
[2500.27s -> 2506.07s]  Let me show you why that this is something that I have to like plug in a ps4 controller
[2506.67s -> 2512.59s]  Right. So if I emulate this game, I have to like emulate the controller which is like ps4
[2513.39s -> 2518.67s]  Which is dual shock, you know what I mean? Like it's just it's annoying. I already have all the original hardware
[2519.87s -> 2521.55s]  I have a
[2521.55s -> 2526.51s]  Capture device to pull in old hardware. I have all the old hardware. I have all the controls and everyone. I just do it
[2526.67s -> 2528.11s]  I have it
[2528.11s -> 2532.83s]  I have like a capture card that's designed for old consoles
[2535.74s -> 2541.18s]  Why am I afraid of technology? You see the fucking goddamn technology that's down here capturing the goddamn game
[2543.65s -> 2553.50s]  Dude, I got cords
[2554.06s -> 2561.62s]  I got a whole capture device down here
[2562.58s -> 2564.98s]  Who needs a fancy phone when the landline works?
[2582.66s -> 2587.47s]  Thank you streamer
[2587.47s -> 2589.47s]  Thanks streamer
[2597.89s -> 2600.46s]  The landline does work
[2600.46s -> 2608.56s]  Come on. That was that was the only disc that has done that. It's the only one that's done it. We've had
[2613.63s -> 2615.63s]  we've played like
[2616.50s -> 2618.50s]  Honestly, we've probably played like
[2618.88s -> 2620.02s]  100
[2620.02s -> 2623.81s]  PlayStation 1 and playstation 2 games as the only one that was scratched
[2624.37s -> 2642.74s]  Somehow come on. Can we just enjoy the waves of the ps2? Yeah, actually I gotta pee really bad
[2644.19s -> 2646.19s]  Uh, I haven't gone to pee this whole time
[2646.19s -> 2649.23s]  In over five hours, so i'm gonna pee we'll come back we'll do the bits
[2649.95s -> 2651.39s]  And we will hang up
[2651.39s -> 2654.02s]  I will see you guys in
[2655.74s -> 2657.26s]  Five minutes maybe
[2657.26s -> 2868.35s]  See you soon. Hello. I have returned
[2882.30s -> 2897.55s]  Put the ps2 sound back on really well. We're about to do the little outro now. We got the cool music, man
[2902.51s -> 2907.44s]  Hey, thank you phylactery lich
[2907.44s -> 2909.44s]  for your 270 subs
[2909.76s -> 2926.29s]  Because this shit won't ever update I even tried to go in here and fix this too and it wouldn't work
[2926.53s -> 2935.18s]  What a piece of crap. What a piece of fucking
[2936.04s -> 2941.71s]  Crap
[2941.71s -> 2945.74s]  No, yeah, that'll be it for tonight. We kind of jumped around all over the place
[2946.38s -> 2948.46s]  We played four games tonight. Can you believe that?
[2951.15s -> 2958.54s]  And we beat two of them. So for the next
[2959.97s -> 2961.73s]  Week or so, let's go over this
[2961.73s -> 2968.51s]  So tomorrow we're gonna do jackbox
[2970.14s -> 2972.45s]  And then I have to get ready to leave
[2972.45s -> 2975.41s]  So after tomorrow's stream you'll see me again on 31st
[2976.21s -> 2978.37s]  for halloween
[2978.37s -> 2983.73s]  The special halloween stream that's gonna happen and then I will be back a few days later
[2984.37s -> 2985.73s]  obviously have to
[2985.73s -> 2990.32s]  Clean up and i'm probably gonna visit some family while i'm down there. So
[2991.12s -> 2994.16s]  I'll be back a couple days. Maybe three days after that four days after that
[3000.18s -> 3001.78s]  and then
[3001.78s -> 3005.71s]  after all that
[3005.71s -> 3007.71s]  once the halloween stream is
[3007.79s -> 3009.44s]  Gone
[3009.44s -> 3011.76s]  I kind of wanna i'm either gonna start dead rising
[3012.48s -> 3014.03s]  or
[3014.03s -> 3015.55s]  Uh outer worlds
[3015.55s -> 3021.33s]  I'm not sure which one
[3021.33s -> 3023.57s]  One of them will be started
[3023.65s -> 3032.43s]  I probably will start with outer worlds just because
[3033.31s -> 3035.90s]  it's new
[3035.90s -> 3036.86s]  and
[3036.86s -> 3038.94s]  I kind of want to play it just see how it is
[3039.74s -> 3050.13s]  And then somewhere in that somewhere in that week, there'll be the other community content night
[3053.39s -> 3057.07s]  So yeah, there'll be community content night dead rising and outer worlds
[3057.97s -> 3060.29s]  After the halloween stream is what you can expect
[3061.01s -> 3063.50s]  And that sounds like a good plan to me, but
[3064.40s -> 3066.42s]  for right now
[3066.42s -> 3069.22s]  Let's go over the bits and the community subs
[3071.42s -> 3073.65s]  Thank you for watching everybody
[3073.65s -> 3079.12s]  See you tomorrow as always and let's go back
[3080.56s -> 3084.64s]  Back back back back back back back back back back to sad vega. Thanks for the 250
[3086.88s -> 3091.34s]  It happened again and it's your fault. Why is everything gonna be my fault?
[3092.38s -> 3094.30s]  I had a dream about streamers last night
[3094.38s -> 3099.18s]  I was on jeopardy and I was getting my ass kicked by some five-year-old zoomer rapping baby
[3099.34s -> 3100.53s]  what
[3100.53s -> 3103.25s]  Until double jeopardy came and it was vine sauce question
[3105.20s -> 3108.80s]  And it was a vine sauce. Wait, where'd that just go? Here it is
[3109.20s -> 3113.60s]  It was a vine sauce question and a final jeopardy question, which the answer was germa 985
[3114.24s -> 3128.85s]  Well, did you win?
[3128.85s -> 3130.69s]  Did you win the game?
[3130.69s -> 3136.70s]  I did. Well, there you go
[3137.89s -> 3139.41s]  As long as you've won
[3139.41s -> 3143.60s]  That sounds pretty good
[3143.60s -> 3145.20s]  Thanks for the dream
[3145.20s -> 3146.96s]  the 250
[3146.96s -> 3150.24s]  Gnarly, thanks for the 250. I had a dream last night. Oh my fucking god
[3150.88s -> 3153.12s]  We're gonna start to get fake ones here now
[3153.60s -> 3156.32s]  This is gonna become a thing. I can already predict it. I had a dream last night
[3156.32s -> 3159.60s]  Don't worry. Not about you. Here we go where I ate a high high
[3160.24s -> 3164.88s]  Class restaurant with my family in the menus. They gave us were screenshots of twitch chat
[3166.24s -> 3169.78s]  Like one user wrote spaghetti and meatballs 899
[3171.44s -> 3173.44s]  Chicken alfredo
[3174.24s -> 3176.24s]  I
[3178.66s -> 3182.58s]  The funny thing is that they wrote the menu in someone else's twitch chat
[3183.14s -> 3186.50s]  So they were just pogchamps and lul's woven between
[3187.46s -> 3189.94s]  Should I stop watching streams before bed?
[3191.34s -> 3193.28s]  That is so
[3193.28s -> 3195.12s]  Dream, you know
[3195.12s -> 3197.44s]  That is such a dream thing to happen
[3198.82s -> 3204.03s]  That's hilarious
[3204.03s -> 3210.43s]  Um, you don't have to stop watching streams before bed. Just stop having streams play while you are sleeping
[3213.58s -> 3220.38s]  I know a lot of you guys have your phones or your ipads in bed and you just fall asleep and there's just it's still going
[3221.18s -> 3229.22s]  Put like a sleep timer on your phone. So after like an hour of no activity, the thing will just turn off
[3229.86s -> 3239.58s]  They used to make tvs like this back in the day
[3241.49s -> 3245.09s]  You could set it so to make sure the tv would turn off after like 40 minutes or something
[3246.53s -> 3250.21s]  Now I know the hardware I got all this hardware, you don't think I got hardware under here
[3252.14s -> 3255.18s]  I know it's a boo. I know boomer, but you see have you seen my hardware, dude?
[3258.22s -> 3262.62s]  It's a tangled mess of cables that my vr is still plugged in and I haven't used it
[3262.94s -> 3267.02s]  It's still tangled up in there, but there's a bunch of fucking wires of technology. You don't think I know technology
[3276.70s -> 3282.06s]  Vr never again. No i'm waiting for this i'm waiting for them when there's too much vr to ignore it
[3283.02s -> 3286.19s]  You know what i'm saying? So like let's do like 20 games
[3286.75s -> 3298.80s]  I'm waiting for wireless high quality vr
[3300.21s -> 3301.81s]  um
[3301.81s -> 3304.19s]  It's possible
[3304.19s -> 3307.87s]  But thank you gnarly for the dream. I think i'm thanking people for their dreams
[3314.99s -> 3317.25s]  Thank you for the 250
[3317.25s -> 3320.77s]  Uh rogue of mv. Thanks for the 2000 bits earlier
[3321.33s -> 3323.33s]  20 bucks from rogue of mv
[3323.41s -> 3325.73s]  Here's the ransom chat has to set you free now
[3327.44s -> 3330.83s]  Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks for the $20 ransom
[3331.47s -> 3335.36s]  Appreciate that. It's 2000 bits. It's a lot. Thank you
[3336.66s -> 3343.38s]  Mostly lost. Thanks for the 250 the year are only two paper marios and anyone who says differently is kidding themselves
[3344.10s -> 3355.84s]  What's the third one three?
[3355.84s -> 3362.06s]  What's the third one?
[3362.06s -> 3364.06s]  super paper mario
[3364.14s -> 3367.46s]  Yeah, because it's super this this paper mario and this paper mario
[3368.10s -> 3372.58s]  Like the thousand year old door or something, right? What is it the 10,000 year old door?
[3373.62s -> 3391.82s]  What was it called? Yeah, that was right. All right. We have another one. Here's an image. It's uh, this is from airless
[3391.90s -> 3393.90s]  Thanks for 500 bits airless
[3394.30s -> 3396.30s]  And they say gerbas smirk
[3402.56s -> 3410.26s]  Why is this so small? Oh, I just look odd
[3413.86s -> 3416.74s]  Anthony bantony became relevant again is what some of what he said
[3417.46s -> 3424.83s]  I did that. I just look strange that doesn't that looks like i'm missing the lego hair. No, I do have the lego hair
[3425.84s -> 3428.88s]  But that's the mouth mouth is too big and the nose is too long. The eyes are too big
[3429.52s -> 3434.13s]  Something weird about that photo
[3434.13s -> 3447.94s]  Uh, thank you airless though for the 500 bits need a lego stream
[3456.90s -> 3461.46s]  Uh, anyways dark soul. Thanks for the 500 bits really enjoying the streams and thanks for doing them
[3461.86s -> 3468.18s]  Thank you for watching was awesome meeting you at the supermarket today. What and really like what you did with your hair
[3471.07s -> 3473.07s]  Right. Okay. I see what you're doing here
[3474.50s -> 3475.54s]  uh
[3475.54s -> 3477.54s]  You even let me get a great picture with you
[3478.64s -> 3481.81s]  Thanks a lot
[3481.81s -> 3497.17s]  You motherfucker
[3504.29s -> 3515.50s]  God damn it. I'm shaving my head. I'm gonna actually be bald
[3518.61s -> 3521.09s]  You won't I know I want it's a lie. I would never do that
[3521.97s -> 3524.82s]  I would look like a fucking serial killer if I ever shaved my head
[3529.04s -> 3532.80s]  Smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. Hey germ. I'm still loving the content. You're such an amazing streamer
[3532.80s -> 3536.48s]  So what are your honest opinions on sherbert as opposed to ice cream?
[3537.36s -> 3538.64s]  I think it's great
[3538.64s -> 3544.88s]  I think there's a time to have sherbert and it's time to have ice cream. I think they have both incredibly talented ice creams
[3546.10s -> 3547.94s]  desserts
[3547.94s -> 3549.70s]  They both deserve
[3549.70s -> 3551.30s]  your time
[3551.30s -> 3563.33s]  I do love sherbert, especially arren sherbert. He's a centrist
[3565.38s -> 3567.94s]  Sherbert tastes good and ice cream tastes good
[3570.62s -> 3572.78s]  What what what do you want me to say here?
[3573.50s -> 3579.07s]  What have you have you seen the hardware on my desk? Do you know what's under there? There's a capture card
[3580.86s -> 3582.86s]  There's another device that feeds
[3582.86s -> 3591.06s]  Into another capture card that is specifically for old video games and then that splits the connection
[3592.17s -> 3594.17s]  forty eight percent goes
[3594.75s -> 3597.87s]  This way and forty eight percent goes the other way
[3599.58s -> 3601.58s]  And then it uh shit
[3605.74s -> 3617.30s]  Into both monitors and they all come they come together for the middle monitor four percent goes into the back of my neck
[3625.44s -> 3627.44s]  Only two monitors in 2019
[3628.69s -> 3630.50s]  I got three
[3630.50s -> 3633.15s]  I got hardware here
[3633.15s -> 3637.63s]  And I don't I don't know. Hey, here's like oh look at what I look at my desk and here's all my equipment
[3637.71s -> 3640.56s]  I don't even do that
[3640.56s -> 3643.60s]  I got three monitors in a connect on top
[3644.32s -> 3650.26s]  Do I have 144 hertz monitors? No, it's a scam
[3650.98s -> 3655.98s]  Human eye can't see over fucking 120 hertz
[3668.19s -> 3670.19s]  That's a fucking scam
[3673.97s -> 3675.17s]  I'll tell you though
[3675.17s -> 3680.61s]  Uh, here's the real answer to that question. So do I don't have any hundred 144 hertz monitors
[3681.49s -> 3685.17s]  And the reason for that is because all of my monitors are 120 hertz
[3686.56s -> 3689.20s]  so justifying buying three new monitors
[3690.00s -> 3691.20s]  for
[3691.20s -> 3693.20s]  24 hertz on each of them
[3694.27s -> 3696.51s]  Is I can't justify that it's not enough
[3697.23s -> 3699.79s]  Now if I was going to go to like 244 maybe
[3700.51s -> 3702.51s]  But I have the opinion that 120 hertz
[3703.31s -> 3704.27s]  is
[3704.27s -> 3705.39s]  I don't
[3705.39s -> 3710.67s]  Okay. Look, I know that like oh, yeah, you're talking about like the analog watch before it. Okay, that's fine
[3712.88s -> 3718.24s]  Right now I don't think anybody needs more than 120 hertz right now right this second
[3722.62s -> 3724.99s]  some people maybe
[3724.99s -> 3730.35s]  If you're really really if you have a 4k monitor and you give it you blasted huge frames
[3731.23s -> 3738.98s]  What am I talking about? I'm talking about
[3739.62s -> 3742.82s]  that 120 hertz versus 144 hertz is not worth spending like
[3743.78s -> 3746.66s]  15 to 2 500 to 2 000 dollars to get three new monitors
[3747.46s -> 3750.85s]  Not enough to do that. I do guys. I'm just playing parapa the rapper today
[3751.65s -> 3754.13s]  Do I need a 244 hertz monitor right now?
[3755.17s -> 3766.69s]  I need all the I need to the power that I could get
[3767.81s -> 3774.66s]  csgo players
[3774.66s -> 3775.92s]  right
[3775.92s -> 3778.88s]  Uh, I haven't opened csgo in probably two and a half years
[3787.63s -> 3788.85s]  cs
[3788.85s -> 3796.18s]  Omega low
[3796.18s -> 3799.94s]  I don't know why that makes me laugh every time. All right, but there but no fucking no bullshit like no kidding around
[3800.58s -> 3804.82s]  Um, yeah, I already have 120 hertz and as much as it'd be cool to have them
[3805.38s -> 3808.85s]  Uh, I don't have a this not necessary maybe eventually
[3809.73s -> 3820.94s]  But not now thanks for the picture dark soul and thank you smelly boy for the 250. Uh, great sherbert is delicious
[3822.61s -> 3824.61s]  And well, though, thanks for the 300 bits
[3824.77s -> 3838.77s]  What are you linking me here? You're linking me like logs of the channel. Can we uh,
[3839.57s -> 3842.05s]  M well does this can we agree? This is an epic moment
[3843.01s -> 3847.52s]  This is a chat log of what are you writing?
[3850.51s -> 3854.59s]  Because you're doing the whole alphabet, but somebody but you say p you ruin it yourself
[3858.51s -> 3862.91s]  Wait, this one is you did you did the whole alphabet and then from m n o
[3863.71s -> 3867.07s]  Oh, you wrote p ee. I get it. We did the whole alphabet. How'd you do that?
[3872.19s -> 3874.19s]  This is what I see right now. I'm just gonna show you guys what I see
[3877.20s -> 3879.20s]  This is it's a log from the channel
[3887.17s -> 3889.17s]  They said this is an epic gamer moment
[3894.26s -> 3898.50s]  It's just the alphabet. I don't even know when you did this and then you said german nose wipe like 40 times
[3899.22s -> 3901.90s]  Did you do this at like two in the morning?
[3909.65s -> 3914.83s]  That's pretty cool. Nice work
[3914.83s -> 3918.91s]  Let's get the credits on the screen. Why not? Thanks everybody for watching. Thanks for supporting the stream
[3918.91s -> 3922.91s]  Thanks for the ridiculous amount of subs and bits as always seriously
[3923.63s -> 3926.77s]  We're gonna do jackbox for a few hours tomorrow
[3927.33s -> 3929.65s]  It's gonna be a chill stream before I have to get ready to leave
[3932.30s -> 3934.30s]  Get ready and do another one
[3938.06s -> 3943.10s]  Because just like the carnival stream, I think some people might not realize that this is a lot more intricate than
[3944.06s -> 3947.34s]  Uh, i've been maybe coming on over the last week or two
[3948.46s -> 3951.79s]  We've got activities to do
[3954.05s -> 3955.17s]  Should be fun
[3955.17s -> 3965.86s]  But as always, thank you. Seriously here come the credits here come the subs

[4029.54s -> 4033.22s]  Uh some very affecting family issues and I know it's cliche
[4033.22s -> 4037.30s]  But watching your videos and content has really helped me and I know I haven't been
[4037.70s -> 4041.22s]  With the channel throughout all of its years, but i'm going to continue to watch and support it. Thank you
[4042.42s -> 4045.70s]  i'm sorry to hear that

[4086.61s -> 4088.85s]  What's going on here? If you're gonna be breath you can start breathing
[4090.05s -> 4094.37s]  This is fucked up. I know you this dead silent. You can't hear anything you do hear
[4095.01s -> 4098.93s]  Over you're a little disoriented somehow you look over here in this you keep you
[4099.33s -> 4103.97s]  You're making it almost these figures and there's noises little like click like clacks and
[4104.45s -> 4109.17s]  You just like what the fuck is going on here. You hear a little cough somebody coughed over there from the left-hand side
[4109.17s -> 4113.89s]  There's like a five or dozen different silhouettes all staring at you
[4114.85s -> 4119.89s]  Finally, but right before you wake the fuck up light turns on and it's happy birthday surprise
