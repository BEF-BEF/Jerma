[0.95s -> 13.22s]  I am I am not late at all. I am precisely on time precisely with a really fucked up voice as per usual
[13.62s -> 22.55s]  Hi, how are you? That was the first part of your week then hopefully it's been pretty good. How was your Monday?
[22.55s -> 25.61s]  How was your Tuesday? How was your weh? Ah?
[26.83s -> 30.11s]  Wait, it's not Wednesday that whole joke got ruined Wow
[31.15s -> 32.63s]  um I
[32.63s -> 35.70s]  Was gonna hold on. Let's try that again. How was your?
[35.86s -> 37.38s]  I
[37.38s -> 43.10s]  Already saw you on Wednesday. So let's do this again. How was your Thursday? How was your Friday? How was your Saturday?
[43.10s -> 46.34s]  How was you set up? We don't know yet. We'll find out soon enough
[47.02s -> 52.54s]  Hopefully we can have a good Sunday together. I actually thought it was Wednesday. Hello
[54.56s -> 57.52s]  That's the streamer mindset. I wasn't even a joke. It was me
[57.52s -> 61.44s]  Just got doing a little thing I did that you should be laughing because I don't know what day it is and
[61.80s -> 64.60s]  Not only do I not know what day it is. I was way off
[65.36s -> 68.72s]  Way off like not even remotely close
[68.96s -> 74.68s]  That's what you should be yellowing in the chat about not you know anything else. It's my voice sucks
[74.68s -> 80.46s]  I couldn't even do yellow well correctly. Do you hear this? I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't get it
[80.54s -> 81.90s]  There are any doctors in here
[81.90s -> 90.74s]  I went to the doctor about like having like junkie voice and like a junkie like painful kind of nose and I was getting
[90.74s -> 94.86s]  Dizzy and shit. I go to the doctor. They put that camera tube up my nose
[94.86s -> 96.94s]  They do an MRI of my head in the brain and shit and they go
[96.94s -> 102.82s]  Oh, no, you just have like cysts all over inside of your mucus cavities. I mean they can cause those problems, but no
[102.82s -> 104.18s]  That's not what's happening
[104.18s -> 108.79s]  Take get it. Take them out. Take them out now get rid of them. I don't want them anymore
[109.51s -> 115.44s]  anyway
[115.44s -> 125.09s]  We're doing fine. We're doing just fine. Oh, they like it in there
[130.04s -> 135.64s]  You can't just take them out. No, I mean I can get them I can get surgery. It's so stupid like I
[136.78s -> 138.86s]  Almost look forward to when we're all just machines
[139.38s -> 146.61s]  Like I could keep our brains and keep our hearts because that's important, but honestly, ah
[148.42s -> 150.42s]  Mr. Elbertson, you've got a hernia
[150.42s -> 153.58s]  we're gonna have to fuck cut into you and cut all the flesh and shit and
[154.10s -> 159.02s]  Mucus membranes and then like pull it out cuz it's stuck there and then you know, that could be why your whole body hurts
[159.54s -> 166.74s]  Okay. Mr. Elbertson you have cysts in your nose and they're growing and they're huge and ugly and we need to cut them out with scissors
[167.54s -> 169.10s]  Whatever the hell they do
[169.14s -> 173.92s]  We need to be made out of steel and platinum and gold
[174.44s -> 185.42s]  None of this flesh bullshit. It's stupid and it gets in the way. That was a big true. Somebody said that right now
[188.38s -> 197.39s]  Are you I'm just kidding my god, I can't I can I not go off on these as comedy rants anymore
[197.91s -> 205.14s]  But honest to God, yeah, I don't know why that you probably noticed it every so often the last six twelve months
[205.14s -> 208.34s]  I gotta figure out what I want to do about it
[208.82s -> 212.57s]  My vocal cords are fine. They've looked at those
[212.73s -> 217.33s]  It's just something going on up in where those cysts are that I'm just gonna have to get them taken out
[217.73s -> 221.00s]  but from
[221.00s -> 229.35s]  Wait, I'm not gonna announce it yet. Hold on. Hold on. We gotta wait for people to trickle in. What did you say?
[230.07s -> 232.91s]  Would you let raccoons do surgery on you?
[233.25s -> 235.45s]  Does the raccoon have his degree in surgery?
[236.13s -> 238.22s]  Because yes, if that's the case
[238.22s -> 248.84s]  If a raccoon can get through med school and get a degree in surgery, then why wouldn't you I mean they let rocket raccoon build
[248.84s -> 252.24s]  A bunch of spaceships. You don't think that he could if he wanted to become a doctor or something
[252.76s -> 266.47s]  What about a frog? Would you let a frog do surgery again?
[267.07s -> 271.19s]  If the frog went through med school, what what do I care?
[271.71s -> 283.14s]  Your hands are too slippery, but they somehow got through med school and got through surgery school
[283.66s -> 291.56s]  They get with gloves. Would you do would you do surgery on yourself?
[292.16s -> 297.30s]  No, because you're looking down. You can't really see that
[297.30s -> 301.90s]  Well, I wouldn't would be somebody we need to be doing it like on top of me right like like cut in the middle
[302.54s -> 306.50s]  You can't look down and like do that. It's not gonna happen
[307.10s -> 309.44s]  He's a mirror
[309.44s -> 316.10s]  at cameras exist, but
[316.38s -> 324.11s]  You're at you're referencing a ludicrous statement. I need another coffee
[324.27s -> 328.83s]  It's like a two or three coffee day because I'll tell you got a major announcement for you
[329.07s -> 334.91s]  And I'm gonna pull back the jokiness because I'm actually gonna talk about a lot of serious things here
[335.59s -> 343.17s]  But should I wait until there's like a ton of people here? Should I do this in the intro?
[343.61s -> 346.66s]  Maybe I'll wait
[346.66s -> 351.22s]  Let's wait for a little bit cuz if I feel like it's it's important enough to talk about it not like put on the
[351.22s -> 352.94s]  Jokey YouTube voice
[352.94s -> 355.94s]  I'll talk to you as me my real voice
[356.54s -> 359.04s]  That's how you know that we're getting serious
[359.16s -> 366.86s]  When I start talking like this, so no more Jokey voice. This is my real voice. That's how I actually talk
[367.50s -> 375.22s]  You're at 10k now. It's not enough. I'm in a weird mood today
[377.56s -> 393.06s]  I'm sorry, I just screamed at you. It's not an it's alright. Just hold on. I'm really excited today. Okay, I'm sorry
[397.13s -> 399.61s]  Compressor just fought with you. Wait, did it like screw that up?
[400.13s -> 407.99s]  Do AI dungeon what we're gonna do a house builder first cuz it popped up
[407.99s -> 413.54s]  I had a plan to play AI dungeon and novel AI today and
[414.14s -> 416.32s]  That's what I told everybody I was gonna do
[416.64s -> 418.64s]  Everybody was aware of that
[418.96s -> 421.84s]  Last second I saw a pop-up for house builder
[422.48s -> 426.48s]  So I changed every single one of my plans. That's what we're doing
[426.96s -> 430.42s]  It's still available though. We could still play it. It's ready to go
[430.98s -> 436.12s]  People were saying that I shouldn't play AI dungeon. I should play novel AI
[436.80s -> 443.76s]  It's AI dungeon got I got like nerfed or something like they they got it out some of the AI or something like that
[443.76s -> 454.56s]  I don't know but AI dungeon has kind of the quest thing, right? I'll try I'll do them both. Don't matter
[455.08s -> 463.34s]  Why is your mouse squeaking?
[463.46s -> 467.11s]  Wait, what do you mean my mouse squeaking? What do you mean?
[467.73s -> 475.68s]  Who's getting too expensive to run so they have yeah, I mean, I mean look Geo guesser is you have to pay for it now
[475.68s -> 476.48s]  too
[476.48s -> 478.69s]  right this
[478.69s -> 481.85s]  It's not that expensive. It's look if
[483.56s -> 487.01s]  It's like Geo guesser like a few dollars or something to play it
[487.25s -> 492.97s]  It's gonna support the people that make the game and support it and keep it running. Whatever that that's that's that's cool. That's fine
[493.53s -> 502.03s]  As long as it doesn't ever become like actually pay to
[502.69s -> 504.81s]  like win
[504.81s -> 512.19s]  Geo guesser is cheaper than subbing here. Yes, it is
[512.71s -> 521.94s]  Yeah, I got them both a to win Google Maps
[522.46s -> 527.66s]  All right. All right. It's time to mute the music
[528.24s -> 531.32s]  Time for the music to stop. I
[531.40s -> 533.00s]  Need to say something gonna talk about something
[533.00s -> 536.92s]  I gotta get this like other music out of my ear because I want to talk to you guys very much
[537.48s -> 540.29s]  to you
[540.33s -> 543.67s]  This has nothing to do by the way with the discord changes
[543.81s -> 546.19s]  This is a completely separate thing that I'm announcing
[546.33s -> 550.69s]  So it's not like I didn't plan on having like a bunch of huge discord
[550.77s -> 554.25s]  Changes and then like and by the way, here we go. That just kind of happened this way
[555.85s -> 560.65s]  Tell a fart joke. I'll tell a fart joke in the middle of this announcement to ruin it. How does that sound?
[561.05s -> 574.76s]  How does that sound I can't win with this record? All right, my go XLR won't record it. So never mind
[575.28s -> 579.58s]  Alright, here we go. No more stalling. No more delaying. This is what I want to tell you
[581.26s -> 583.10s]  And then we're gonna talk about it for a little bit
[583.10s -> 587.54s]  So if you if you thought you were gonna go right into house builder, I got some news for you
[587.54s -> 592.64s]  You got about five to ten minutes sitting here looking at this starting suing screen. Maybe not maybe a little bit less
[592.92s -> 600.76s]  We just sit in the menu too. That's fine. Yeah, that's fine. So
[601.60s -> 609.12s]  What is the in five minutes is okay. So as you know, those of you that have been on this channel for a long time
[610.35s -> 612.71s]  Some of you for more than a decade, which is crazy
[613.35s -> 619.14s]  You know that sometimes I do very large streams whether that's the dollhouse whether that's
[619.66s -> 624.82s]  The Halloween stream Bugleberry shows up sometimes. He's a good friend of mine, by the way, good friend of mine
[626.44s -> 632.84s]  baseball other stuff that I really want to do it's starting the bills are starting to add up and
[634.37s -> 640.36s]  Over the next kind of arc of my career here, which I'll be honest
[640.36s -> 647.76s]  I kind of want to make this like the like the big one what is happening now
[647.90s -> 653.42s]  As I've decided going back and forth and talking with various people and various things
[653.42s -> 659.32s]  I am now signed with evolved. I'm now under the evolved umbrella
[662.83s -> 668.52s]  Evolved is the company that represents XQC in a talent agency way
[670.25s -> 679.86s]  Also, cutie Cinderella, I think Austin show and a shitload of eSports players, right? So why why why are you doing this?
[679.86s -> 684.30s]  Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Oh, wait a minute. This dude's now all of a sudden. He's like signed with a talent agency
[684.78s -> 690.30s]  He blew up his discord and like now what the fuck what corporate Andy is taking over. Is that what's happening?
[690.30s -> 698.48s]  No, just wait everybody. Hold everybody settle down settle down. I need I want to make this really clear
[698.48s -> 705.04s]  He's becoming a CS go pro. What if that was the announcement?
[710.18s -> 715.17s]  What if no, that would be so dumb
[715.41s -> 720.81s]  That would be so that would be such a bad dumb move for me because I don't play CS go and I'm not very good
[721.65s -> 734.50s]  It what's below bronze is there a wood like I would be wood rank in League of Legends or whatever it is plastic
[734.86s -> 738.42s]  so
[738.42s -> 746.02s]  essentially what this means is that there's now a lot there's gonna be a lot of opportunities now to tap into potential sponsorships and
[746.62s -> 748.83s]  brands and
[748.83s -> 750.87s]  money and
[750.87s -> 753.65s]  Making money from these different avenues and stuff, right?
[754.01s -> 761.39s]  But I gotta be really clear about this the big shows cost a lot of money and we struggled
[761.39s -> 763.39s]  I was I was actually thinking about having Jake
[763.67s -> 768.87s]  Community Jake come on here and talk about this with me because he's a lot more well-spoken than I am and a lot of things
[769.03s -> 771.89s]  but I
[771.89s -> 777.88s]  I'll be very transparent with you guys the streams that you see from time to time
[778.20s -> 785.15s]  They rack up and have racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills over the last few years
[786.48s -> 788.87s]  dollhouse alone was an
[789.59s -> 798.79s]  Unbelievable amount of money and I have to start to think about as I go into this kind of this arc of my online
[799.07s -> 802.15s]  Entertainment life for whatever you want to call it e clown world
[802.15s -> 807.48s]  I have to start to be able to pay for these things and I could I maybe pay for them
[807.48s -> 810.12s]  Oh, I probably could it would be pretty bad though
[810.12s -> 814.95s]  I think over another few years of doing this it might actually not be a good thing
[814.95s -> 821.36s]  So I'm opening the idea of being able to have a bigger dialogue with sponsors
[821.60s -> 827.60s]  Be signed with a talent agency so they can handle this shit. They come to me. They say hey, dude
[827.60s -> 829.60s]  You want to do for instance?
[830.16s -> 834.44s]  You guys are I've talked about it a thousand times. So I'm just gonna talk about it again
[834.44s -> 843.14s]  I want to do Jerma rumble live on twitch, right? I want to do Jerma rumble live live and
[844.51s -> 851.85s]  That show is going to be an absolute metric fucking huge amount of money to be able to do stuff like that
[852.21s -> 859.74s]  I need to have the capital to be able to do it and I'm going to only take sponsorships and only take money from places
[860.18s -> 862.18s]  That I know that I'll have control
[862.46s -> 866.90s]  Streams are not gonna change. It's I'm not gonna do like fucking like
[867.62s -> 874.55s]  Laundry detergent tweets once a week that's not happening as I tweet like five times a fucking year
[874.55s -> 877.55s]  Anyways, you think I'm really who wants me to do tweets for their business
[877.59s -> 883.77s]  But I have to start to think about this stuff and I have to really start to take into consideration
[884.37s -> 889.04s]  That there are companies that their whole goal is to make you
[889.80s -> 891.52s]  money for stuff and
[891.52s -> 898.96s]  Sponsorships and bring brands in we it was a painful experience to get the dollhouse paid for a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff
[898.96s -> 905.88s]  You guys don't know about that show that was very very very difficult to have happen. I want to try to eliminate that
[905.88s -> 911.94s]  I want to make it easier on
[912.50s -> 917.06s]  production on people that are showing up on myself to not have to kind of
[917.70s -> 924.70s]  Drag their heels into the ground trying to figure out how we're gonna pay for a show and some of you might be saying
[924.90s -> 929.60s]  right, maybe not maybe not something maybe I'm just making you up, but that's fine. I want to say this anyways is
[930.52s -> 935.85s]  Well, then what just don't do the shows like don't just don't do the big shows if they're this much of a
[936.37s -> 939.53s]  Financial kind of burden in a lot of ways don't do them. Just don't do them
[940.94s -> 944.24s]  We don't need them. I have to be very honest with you
[944.24s -> 950.74s]  If I wasn't doing the big shows, I would have quit two or three years ago
[950.78s -> 957.78s]  I would have retired years ago and I made a very very important statement over the last three or four years
[958.26s -> 968.00s]  The if I'm not interested, I'm not gonna stay and yeah the the the replacement stream joke
[968.14s -> 970.14s]  That was that was a joke
[970.30s -> 971.76s]  but you know
[971.76s -> 979.63s]  I have to really think about how I'm gonna stay interested and that is what interests me doing like German rumble live is
[981.22s -> 986.38s]  What I am interested in doing doing baseball is what keeps me interested
[988.26s -> 995.01s]  And if these things weren't here and I wasn't actively on a daily weekly basis trying to you know
[995.01s -> 1002.27s]  Get these shows off the ground. I probably would have stopped. He actually hates streaming
[1004.18s -> 1009.20s]  He actually hates no, that's not what I'm saying. No, I love streaming
[1009.20s -> 1010.92s]  I what are you talking about?
[1010.92s -> 1014.88s]  You would have seen the shows the the projects the events
[1014.88s -> 1017.08s]  That's what I'd live for right now, right?
[1017.20s -> 1025.21s]  But this stuff has to get paid for and if that especially if I want to do them as more often like you've been seeing
[1025.37s -> 1027.58s]  It's been pretty much
[1027.58s -> 1031.45s]  Every what like three or four months every like few months
[1031.45s -> 1035.70s]  There's like something that's not like just like kind of sitting in a like a desk stream, right?
[1036.06s -> 1043.51s]  So what evolved is gonna do is they're gonna come in and they're gonna connect me to brands and to people that hey
[1043.51s -> 1048.13s]  You know what? Uh, yeah that stream that you want to do sounds like really fun and really cool
[1048.39s -> 1054.96s]  We'll give you money for it. That's the whole purpose of this and I know I said it was gonna be five minutes
[1054.96s -> 1058.48s]  And I know it's been like 15. Ah
[1061.39s -> 1069.54s]  Also, let me make I'm gonna give you some hard lines here for you to understand if I will not have
[1070.32s -> 1072.88s]  complete direct control over
[1073.40s -> 1079.46s]  Everything I will not take a sponsor a lot of people wouldn't when they saw the coinbase sponsor
[1079.86s -> 1084.78s]  They thought that it was like holy shit. Oh my god. The stream is ruined
[1084.82s -> 1090.78s]  He's gonna be shilling coins and NFTs. That's not gonna happen. That is not going to happen
[1090.94s -> 1095.94s]  Let me be very clear with everybody that is not ever going to happen
[1096.89s -> 1101.95s]  If I do not have exact direct control of everything, it's not happening
[1101.95s -> 1103.38s]  I'll say no, thank you
[1103.38s -> 1113.30s]  But that's where that stands if you see a sponsor on this channel over the coming months
[1113.66s -> 1117.41s]  It's because of a few reasons reason number one
[1118.03s -> 1120.03s]  fucking
[1120.19s -> 1123.07s]  Reason number two
[1123.31s -> 1130.30s]  What was it? Oh, I'm paying for shows. No, I mean, I'm just fucking around but seriously
[1131.26s -> 1139.85s]  Reason number one and pretty much the only reason is to make money to pay for the big stuff and the big stuff is
[1140.01s -> 1147.84s]  Very expensive. I'm not trying to make a shitload of money from sponsors to take and put in my personal bank account
[1147.84s -> 1150.09s]  I want to pay for shows
[1150.09s -> 1154.18s]  I want to be able to pay the people on the shows and be able to do them without
[1154.70s -> 1160.28s]  stressing myself out financially or sitting there in the middle of like our dollhouse production going
[1160.72s -> 1166.32s]  Okay, we fucking need money or this isn't happening. I want that to not happen ever again
[1166.32s -> 1173.57s]  So I I think that it's a good fit
[1174.25s -> 1178.56s]  Yeah, and we'll see going forward. It's gonna be
[1179.00s -> 1180.64s]  It's gonna see how much I like it
[1180.64s -> 1189.35s]  I'm very very happy with what they've said so far and I hopefully the relationship like in a business wise can flourish and
[1190.07s -> 1200.08s]  Evolved can come in and help out this channel and you guys will see what they do also
[1200.12s -> 1204.85s]  I know five minutes. I know another important thing to understand is
[1205.57s -> 1212.63s]  I if I'm gonna do a huge show that's gonna cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1212.63s -> 1218.61s]  I don't want that to be a financial burden on the community, right?
[1218.61s -> 1221.52s]  Like I don't want to have to be like oh shit
[1221.52s -> 1226.16s]  Well, I really should like really need some more subs this month. Otherwise, it's gonna be hard to do
[1227.04s -> 1232.08s]  It's gonna be hard to do that the playground stream and we get a bunch of playground equipment and we do like
[1232.72s -> 1234.80s]  Olympic level playground equipment
[1236.08s -> 1238.76s]  Competitions like right that's not happening that I just made that up
[1239.66s -> 1240.74s]  But that's my you know
[1240.74s -> 1244.06s]  I mean like I don't want to have to I would rather it be a sponsor comes in
[1244.30s -> 1250.18s]  Drops a bunch of money and it's I don't have it's not like the burden is not put on either me or me needing to kind
[1250.18s -> 1252.18s]  Of tell everybody
[1254.58s -> 1256.06s]  20k
[1256.06s -> 1262.40s]  Cuz I don't want to do that
[1262.40s -> 1266.40s]  And I've never ever this is five minute Andy
[1266.64s -> 1270.78s]  The only time that a stream or a YouTube video really has ever been sponsored
[1270.78s -> 1277.44s]  It has been dollhouse that I never really have ever done a sponsorship. Maybe one
[1278.06s -> 1281.14s]  Back in like the YouTube days. I don't even like remember it's been so long
[1281.46s -> 1286.03s]  but all the major streams that you see all the major videos guys, I
[1288.29s -> 1293.37s]  Liquidated my 401k to make the German rumble video
[1293.69s -> 1296.21s]  That's a that's a story you've heard many times
[1296.57s -> 1299.88s]  So it's not I
[1301.07s -> 1305.50s]  Need to start to think about who is gonna pay for these things and if it's gonna be me
[1305.70s -> 1309.57s]  You know who knows maybe I'm like maybe I'm not brand friendly
[1309.75s -> 1312.37s]  What I will will find the right brands, right?
[1312.47s -> 1321.29s]  This plunge of companies that I've talked really highly of we won't know who who is going to
[1321.99s -> 1323.99s]  He says fuck all the time
[1326.89s -> 1335.28s]  But you know, there's there's a lot of opportunity I just want don't want people to think that this is now
[1335.28s -> 1343.04s]  Oh, he's cash it out. He's getting kind of the end of his like career. So he's putting all the chips on the table
[1343.04s -> 1347.56s]  Hey, fuck this whole thing. I'm pulling out all this money. No, that's not happening. I
[1348.72s -> 1351.53s]  just want to be able to pay for shows and
[1351.61s -> 1354.91s]  However, we can do that if I need to do some sponsorships if you see it here in there
[1354.91s -> 1358.93s]  That's what's gonna happen. It's gonna be I'm gonna make sure it's stuff that I really want to do though
[1359.41s -> 1367.05s]  Which makes hey, excuse me all all advertisers. Excuse me all advertisers, please pay attention
[1367.73s -> 1373.82s]  Don't you think that makes this this channel way more fucking valuable? Wait, he's only had wait
[1373.82s -> 1376.54s]  He's only had one sponsor ever. Oh
[1377.53s -> 1383.43s]  Like we can get on there. Give him 10 million. Give him 20 million. Give him 30 million, right?
[1383.43s -> 1385.43s]  Like that's pretty valuable
[1389.58s -> 1392.34s]  He expects 20 million dollars. No
[1393.06s -> 1399.85s]  He's so fucked up, but I'm only gonna start today
[1399.85s -> 1404.01s]  I'm gonna take sponsors from things that I really want to take sponsors from and I'm gonna have control and
[1404.92s -> 1412.56s]  Evolved has been very very upfront. They said dude. We get it this music. This has been the music that's been on the whole time
[1413.16s -> 1421.54s]  What is this like church music? Oh my god, turn that off. It's I'm in a boy. It's not bad
[1421.54s -> 1428.18s]  It's like nights like it's nice music, but I feel like okay. He says he's gonna use it for big shows
[1428.62s -> 1432.26s]  He's gonna use it to pay. No, this is
[1432.78s -> 1434.78s]  televangelist inspirational bullshit
[1437.80s -> 1439.80s]  It
[1439.80s -> 1441.96s]  Really does feel like I'm a televangelist
[1441.96s -> 1448.64s]  I am asking you I am set talking about money and where money is gonna come from to the to the church to the congregation
[1448.92s -> 1454.70s]  You know, I'm sorry everybody what I have to start to think about here is
[1455.71s -> 1461.07s]  How we're gonna make the church grow even bigger than it is now and we do that
[1461.59s -> 1464.31s]  By talking about this company here as you see I
[1465.20s -> 1468.96s]  Can't I don't want to make a joke about a sponsor because like I'm like sponsor Andy now, right?
[1469.60s -> 1475.58s]  Oh, that's off-limits. Can't talk about that. I can't bring up this company. Okay, just in case they ever were interested
[1476.16s -> 1481.10s]  People like okay, but if all it doesn't know just don't tell them
[1482.58s -> 1486.86s]  What they don't know is like they're gonna come to me with sponsor people
[1487.36s -> 1490.50s]  Hey, we've got this deal for you. Maybe it'll make you a really good amount of money
[1490.50s -> 1495.10s]  You can take this and then like all that show in fucking June is gonna be awesome. Okay, sure
[1495.70s -> 1497.70s]  What was the company again? Oh
[1497.70s -> 1501.14s]  Let me let me give you a list of all the companies that are interested
[1501.74s -> 1506.76s]  Okay. Well, I told that company that they suck. I told that company to fuck off. I said fuck that company
[1506.76s -> 1511.60s]  I said this company makes disgusting dogshit products. Um, I can't use any of these
[1513.12s -> 1519.91s]  Wait what? Yeah, unless you come in at me with like hamburger helper
[1521.03s -> 1528.64s]  Or like McDonald's is the only two companies have ever spoken highly of you said to know other companies have ever talked highly of
[1529.00s -> 1531.37s]  If you like jet blue
[1531.53s -> 1533.53s]  Well, there you go. This is your criteria
[1534.17s -> 1536.57s]  And for your helper he'll and
[1538.29s -> 1539.85s]  Chuck E cheese
[1539.85s -> 1549.94s]  Please don't do NFT guys. I okay turn the funny music off. Let me just be really clear. Yes
[1550.24s -> 1556.24s]  You guys know that I've had I had the coinbase sponsor. Yes. I've been involved in crypto over the years
[1556.24s -> 1559.37s]  You understand that right? But I'm not going to do that
[1559.37s -> 1564.57s]  I'm not gonna I don't I'm not gonna jump into like the NFT game now that I have a sponsorship
[1564.65s -> 1570.79s]  That's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna do that. I have no interest in NFTs. I have I don't care about them
[1570.79s -> 1573.43s]  I don't I don't focus on them at all. It's nothing that I care about
[1573.43s -> 1582.80s]  I have no interest at all. So I gotta make that because people people are probably gonna think that like if I tell he's gonna start
[1582.80s -> 1587.06s]  Taking sponsorships. He's gonna he wants to take big money sponsorships. He took a coinbase sponsorship
[1587.48s -> 1593.64s]  No, I am in control of what I want to do and I have no interest in that space at all
[1593.64s -> 1598.41s]  I just don't so
[1598.41s -> 1610.48s]  I've seen that pop up in chat a little bit and I want to make sure that that's people understand that is it true
[1610.56s -> 1614.90s]  What about subway? I mean I have I talked bet. Okay, you guys have to do me a favor here
[1615.12s -> 1619.35s]  Well, I mean we need to kind of come up with all the companies that I've spoken highly of right
[1620.93s -> 1626.89s]  imagine being like a brand person for one of these companies and you go to this you pay a bunch of money to have this like
[1626.89s -> 1629.32s]  streamer do this shit and
[1629.60s -> 1636.76s]  Somebody links you a clip of them like taking a bite of your of your most famous sandwich and saying this is dogshit into the camera
[1636.76s -> 1643.89s]  All right. All right. I know I know I've been sitting for like 20 minutes
[1643.89s -> 1649.77s]  it's important though to write and I want to touch upon the discord stuff as well because I've seen a lot of people kind of
[1650.33s -> 1658.37s]  Talk about what the fuck is happening on the discord. I I need to start to get some of these places more manageable for me and
[1659.80s -> 1661.49s]  Over the last few months
[1661.49s -> 1667.03s]  I've been trying to figure out how to do that how to make the discord the cleaner experience for me better for the mods
[1667.23s -> 1669.83s]  Better for me to manage because at the end of the day
[1670.03s -> 1674.17s]  It's it's the German 985 official discord
[1674.17s -> 1680.13s]  Which the buck stops at my desk and I kind of have to see how things go there. We've seen problems there
[1680.13s -> 1683.13s]  We've seen great incredible things come from that space, right?
[1683.13s -> 1688.20s]  I have to try to get it to where I can pay attention to it to where I can manage it
[1688.24s -> 1694.96s]  Have a group of mods that can think it can manage it with me. You're gonna get TV burning
[1695.16s -> 1702.23s]  Look, there's a few important things going on and no, I'm sorry. There's like little sparkles going on over here
[1702.23s -> 1703.47s]  So it's gonna be fine
[1703.47s -> 1712.65s]  It's not gonna burn into my monitor as this channel kind of changes and as this channel
[1714.05s -> 1718.24s]  Evolves you're gonna there'll be some things you'll see that are changing and
[1719.23s -> 1721.96s]  Like I said, I'm trying to keep myself interested
[1721.96s -> 1724.48s]  I'm trying to keep myself connected to the space as best as I can
[1724.96s -> 1729.12s]  You can't minus to the new agency that has signed to me. That's not how it works
[1732.09s -> 1733.57s]  But as we go forward here
[1733.57s -> 1740.47s]  I need to find ways to make it so I can disconnect because you guys have known this for the last
[1740.55s -> 1748.65s]  Most almost 11 plus years of being around I disconnect I don't interact that much and that's very much by design
[1748.65s -> 1753.20s]  I need to disconnect. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to do it for this long
[1754.56s -> 1759.24s]  The constant kind of stress and the constant awareness of having a community this big is
[1761.04s -> 1763.53s]  my way of handling it is
[1764.25s -> 1771.07s]  To not to really disconnect from it a lot of times and I mean, like I said, I don't tweet that much
[1771.07s -> 1772.35s]  I'm not on social media that much
[1772.35s -> 1778.60s]  So in the spaces that I'm you know, officially a part of that I officially own going forward here, too
[1778.60s -> 1784.20s]  Not just on discord on twitch on you know, the YouTube space on like the sponsor space
[1784.24s -> 1792.59s]  I gotta get it under control because I'm not really that much of a participant. Please play dude. The edibles are kicking in
[1792.59s -> 1796.58s]  Oh shit that guy that do art that one guy
[1797.20s -> 1804.78s]  Was like ready for house builder and it's pissed because we've been sitting here for 25 plus minutes
[1805.32s -> 1809.98s]  Talking about like the state of the channel in the community and shit and this guy is sitting here
[1810.46s -> 1815.14s]  sinking into his couch and like starting to the world is zoning out and
[1815.30s -> 1820.02s]  He's sitting there going to please pick up the fucking cement truck and just dump the cement dude
[1820.02s -> 1825.81s]  This is too much for my fucking brain. What do you got son? What do you mean Italian? He's evolving
[1825.93s -> 1831.02s]  No, I don't want an evolved version of this fucking weirdo. No. No, I'm leaving the community
[1831.02s -> 1837.54s]  I just that person just left the community that person thinks I'm like turning into like a new Pokemon or something
[1837.54s -> 1840.87s]  Like I just fucked it very TLDR
[1842.24s -> 1847.56s]  Sponsorships are gonna become a thing now. I want to pay for big streams some of the biggest streams I've ever done
[1848.20s -> 1855.85s]  Even more large in scale than the dollhouse are currently underway. I'm gotta I've got I gotta believe
[1856.13s -> 1871.20s]  All right, let's go. All the things that I'm doing are trying to make my life a little easier. That's it. Okay, you fucking criticize me
[1871.88s -> 1883.89s]  You're gone. I will ban you fucking permanently with the click of one of my fucking fingers. So watch it. Okay
[1885.41s -> 1891.88s]  All right house builder, this is not like house flipper. It's different
[1892.04s -> 1895.20s]  You build the houses rather than flip them this game
[1895.80s -> 1898.44s]  Might be dog. You know what?
[1898.90s -> 1905.20s]  We're turning over a new leaf because at some point, you know, you got a can't just say that about anything that I come across
[1905.80s -> 1915.67s]  Corporate Andy, let's go. All right, we're gonna start. I think you start small. You can't say anything bad about anyone anymore
[1917.56s -> 1926.01s]  Hey evolved. I'll give you a list. Okay, I'll give you a nice list. This is an igloo house. It's easy
[1926.45s -> 1937.49s]  This is a mud house and it's easy it's the only two I can do and now let's put on that youtuber voice
[1937.83s -> 1944.39s]  Should have a face cam. No, maybe in a minute. Maybe if you're good the igloo
[1944.73s -> 1954.89s]  We're gonna learn to play about instead of a house. We build a home. I'm that person up for 30 minutes
[1962.48s -> 1966.04s]  Good to see you builder. I hope the weather won't scare you off. Let's be honest
[1966.20s -> 1971.10s]  That's a tough job as you probably know we build all around the world
[1971.10s -> 1975.24s]  You might expect bigger buildings more mechanics and construction challenges in the future
[1975.24s -> 1978.56s]  But for now, let's see how you handle it. Have fun a
[1979.20s -> 1987.37s]  Little loud for me, but it's probably not loud for you. Is it? Oh, we have a dog. Can we pet the dog?
[1987.37s -> 1995.59s]  I mean kind of start building the igloo. You must first cut out ice blocks
[1995.95s -> 2004.84s]  What to do this grab the highlighted bone knife and come near the ice quarry and while holding the left mouse button draw a
[2005.16s -> 2007.26s]  Contour along the scratch on the ice
[2007.92s -> 2013.44s]  What it just jump scared me?
[2014.16s -> 2016.00s]  Okay, snow bricks
[2016.00s -> 2021.76s]  What? Okay, so pick up the ice block. Oh
[2028.00s -> 2040.25s]  Pick up the knife. Oh, there's a knife. It's like a melee weapon get closer to the source of ice
[2040.97s -> 2052.19s]  This is the source of ice. I mean isn't ice just literally surrounding us. It's so bright. It's so bright
[2052.19s -> 2057.32s]  I think I'm gonna need to put on some HD glasses some brightness reducing glasses
[2058.26s -> 2065.31s]  Thankfully, I'm open to sponsorships now. I wonder what kind I would put on. I wonder what brand I would be using
[2065.81s -> 2069.19s]  God really need them now own
[2069.81s -> 2074.93s]  Igloo knife before you start you'll have to find an igloo bone knife press e to grab it. Okay
[2075.51s -> 2080.25s]  You already have a knife in your hands draw a contour along visible track on the ice
[2080.75s -> 2092.13s]  While holding left when you see there's no more ice on the hole. You have to look for another source. What we're here
[2092.55s -> 2109.31s]  Whoa. Oh shit. Okay, cool new skill available. Oh my god
[2109.83s -> 2114.40s]  It's like the path of exile skill tree
[2116.20s -> 2121.49s]  This is bigger than path of exile. Let me see. This isn't accurate at all
[2121.81s -> 2126.57s]  You know what else isn't accurate at all not well, I was gonna say not I thought I didn't have I thought I didn't have
[2126.57s -> 2128.57s]  The love zone never mind joke ruined
[2130.36s -> 2138.10s]  With this skill you will cut two times more snow blocks at the same time. Okay, I got it two times more snow blocks
[2138.62s -> 2145.00s]  Cut ice for the new snow blocks. All right, let's go
[2145.56s -> 2153.18s]  Doesn't matter how sloppy it is. Oh
[2153.58s -> 2163.74s]  Dude, it's I got two. Ooh
[2163.74s -> 2167.82s]  The bonfire is dying you have to throw more sticks into the fire or you will freeze
[2168.42s -> 2170.79s]  Wait, we can I can die
[2173.73s -> 2181.81s]  Get more sticks in there. How much to show to use? Wait, am I using way too much? Oh shit
[2181.81s -> 2188.51s]  I'm like, I'm the guy that you don't want to survive with the better. All right more ice
[2189.15s -> 2201.04s]  Yo, man, I got if we burn a hundred sticks. We'll get a huge fire. It'll be really warm
[2201.52s -> 2214.45s]  Eat that guy first, okay skill tree. Yeah to start building the igloo. You must first cut I already did this
[2217.14s -> 2226.44s]  Okay, I'm just gonna cut ice for a little while. All right. Why would I go back and forth? This one's empty
[2227.08s -> 2233.04s]  What they're telling you because you're doing an awful job
[2233.52s -> 2237.78s]  Well, I'm gonna get awful job this one square meter that I can cut ice out
[2238.12s -> 2249.99s]  This game is fucking sick. By the way, I thought I was gonna be building houses in like a
[2250.67s -> 2253.79s]  Good neighborhood or something. This is actually cool. You have to like
[2254.43s -> 2265.58s]  Make your way build your way up to that. How much can I carry? This is an IRL scream
[2265.58s -> 2270.12s]  I hope nobody ever does an IRL scream like this. I feel like I'd be terrified the whole time
[2270.62s -> 2278.21s]  Okay, so now
[2278.21s -> 2279.81s]  with my blocks
[2279.81s -> 2284.31s]  Whoo? I got a new skill
[2284.99s -> 2292.89s]  It's kind of a cereal box game, but I actually really like it. I'm gonna be honest
[2292.89s -> 2301.52s]  I got new skills with this skill. You will cut six times more blocks
[2301.96s -> 2313.61s]  Yeah, this is this is this is definitely like I like a cereal box game
[2313.61s -> 2318.85s]  This is like the CD that comes in the cereal box, but you know what some of those games are actually really good
[2319.41s -> 2331.80s]  Whoa, I love it. It's so easy. It's a simple
[2332.32s -> 2338.48s]  By the way, please make sure you join me for my Elden Ring launch party
[2343.01s -> 2346.87s]  Probably like four or five o'clock like maybe 16 hours into the launch
[2347.57s -> 2351.77s]  Be one of the last streamers, you know playing it. I would probably assure you of that
[2352.21s -> 2367.09s]  All right, what about this? Oh, I can sprint 30% faster. Okay, cool. What's wrong?
[2367.93s -> 2371.20s]  What is the dog doing?
[2371.24s -> 2379.56s]  It's not trying to add oxygen to the fire. Good boy. I have to hurry up
[2379.56s -> 2395.14s]  Oh go go go go. I gotta get this done before nightfall
[2395.94s -> 2408.88s]  Shit, how is it at 0%? How is it at 0%?
[2409.52s -> 2423.46s]  Wait, wait, wait sprint away igloo. Okay, 15 times more blocks. Nice. How far can I go?
[2424.12s -> 2431.15s]  We've got some sections here. Oh
[2431.67s -> 2434.31s]  That was so satisfying. It's like a little marshmallows. I
[2436.77s -> 2448.70s]  Just gotta collect blocks already 40. How many should I get?
[2450.75s -> 2462.12s]  Come on stop this game actually runs really well
[2462.72s -> 2472.04s]  Don't you think this is one of those games that should run at like eight frames a second all these games run like shit
[2472.04s -> 2486.18s]  So it's actually kind of surprising almost done. I get the roof. It's games from tooth. Yeah
[2486.58s -> 2495.68s]  Just give him 2011 no, it's not it came out like it last year or something. I don't build the roof
[2496.20s -> 2503.94s]  Not building the igloo. You must first cut ice blocks. I know that's right. How do I jump up here? Can I go in?
[2506.17s -> 2521.04s]  Scratch, okay. This is a really really funny igloo. I don't know how to twitch chat integration. That's funny. I'm killing it right now. I
[2523.27s -> 2524.87s]  Got it. I got it. I got it
[2524.87s -> 2536.90s]  Well, can't you go like get us a rabbit or something like go go get us like some food. What do you come on?
[2537.42s -> 2553.72s]  You're wasting wood. It's fine. We're gonna be surviving in there. Anyways, we'll find a rascally rabbit. I
[2558.09s -> 2570.58s]  Don't even know if there's another one. Nice. I think the wood respawns. Oh, okay. That's good
[2571.22s -> 2574.04s]  Thanks for quelling my fears. I
[2574.16s -> 2580.74s]  Think that should be good 50. Yeah, that's good
[2581.02s -> 2592.11s]  The new Samsung smart fridge has switch integration and Skyrim integration talk to the fans about that
[2592.63s -> 2596.44s]  Yeah, I just said that without you paying me to say that
[2596.96s -> 2598.60s]  How dare you?
[2598.60s -> 2601.84s]  Please reach out to my evolved representative, please
[2602.52s -> 2604.36s]  for a
[2604.36s -> 2613.45s]  retroactive payment I
[2614.21s -> 2621.72s]  Gotta get inside. I thought it was 365 degrees in here
[2621.72s -> 2632.93s]  I was like what how many ice blocks does it take to do this?
[2633.49s -> 2647.16s]  Goodness, okay. I need more your characters arm is identical to a character in the Incredibles
[2647.16s -> 2661.92s]  I I've never seen the Incredibles. No, I haven't I know I know that's like saying I've never seen Star Wars, right?
[2662.92s -> 2670.58s]  The last what was the I think the last Disney Pixar movie that I saw was Meet the Robinsons
[2671.06s -> 2677.45s]  The only reason why I watched that movie is because I thought the bowler hat guy was funny and cool and like I wanted
[2677.45s -> 2682.16s]  To see his scenes only in fact now that I'm remembering this
[2682.16s -> 2685.88s]  I think I just went to like YouTube and typed in all the bowler hat guys scenes
[2686.32s -> 2701.25s]  And didn't even watch the movie. Oh, no, I think I saw it. I think I watched it. I got it. Don't worry
[2701.61s -> 2717.25s]  All right, we're almost done. No, it was a nice movie. I especially like the trailer when the dinosaur goes
[2718.66s -> 2725.70s]  Big hand new arms. I did
[2726.54s -> 2735.71s]  We have to driveway press O to open the shop. Whoa
[2736.47s -> 2749.77s]  Wooden barricade, where should I put this? Am I supposed to be doing this?
[2758.62s -> 2762.30s]  To build an entrance to the igloo you can build one in the same way you built it
[2762.30s -> 2773.56s]  I can move it, but where does it want me to put it nice?
[2774.16s -> 2775.40s]  more
[2775.40s -> 2781.19s]  Where am I supposed to put this? I can't move it anywhere else. Do you mean it's like I can't
[2781.71s -> 2785.84s]  Okay, it was stuck on there. That was weird
[2786.52s -> 2800.48s]  Can only build one to go. All right. All right. Look arc
[2801.48s -> 2807.36s]  You're playing arc survival evolved. I like that name
[2813.09s -> 2820.36s]  I'm sorry. It's so bad. It's so bad
[2821.08s -> 2830.19s]  It's a jump to how about destiny to that was hard. That was a really hard game
[2830.79s -> 2848.08s]  This doesn't have really good feng shui. Sorry, the igloo doesn't have
[2848.68s -> 2854.43s]  Like what do you want? How do you want me to feng shui this?
[2854.99s -> 2867.28s]  Looks like the igloo got punched in the face and lost a few teeth. That's it. Oh
[2868.74s -> 2873.54s]  Cool. I did it. I got five stars. I did in 13 minutes. I ran
[2874.26s -> 2876.84s]  986 miles. Oh
[2876.84s -> 2898.70s]  Wait, stay here. Nice. This is a pizza oven. Okay, what's next? There are gunshots
[2899.46s -> 2902.21s]  All right, so let's go
[2902.21s -> 2905.82s]  Report a bug. No, no, no. How do I leave here?
[2906.50s -> 2912.98s]  exit save
[2912.98s -> 2919.28s]  Go to the main menu. Yeah
[2919.28s -> 2928.35s]  Okay, play I did this one. Nice. So what is any other things open up or do I have to go to the other one?
[2928.75s -> 2936.83s]  This is a mud house and it's a level medium. Looks like we're gonna start to include some wood
[2937.39s -> 2948.58s]  Here comes primitive technology German
[2949.10s -> 2952.43s]  Fun fact, you don't give up easily. Do you?
[2952.87s -> 2958.87s]  Do you I thought I said it twice like do you good as another challenge awaits you hope you brought an insect spray
[2958.99s -> 2963.55s]  You may need it. We heard some stories about a hungry lion around here. Let's get the job done quickly
[2963.55s -> 2965.27s]  So we don't have to face him
[2965.27s -> 2967.62s]  What?
[2967.62s -> 2969.70s]  We still have a dog
[2969.70s -> 2974.50s]  Okay, the first step is to lay stone foundations
[2974.82s -> 2979.86s]  Look around for stones in appropriate size collect the required amount and put them in the right places. Alright, so here's a stone
[2980.70s -> 2983.58s]  Okay, so let's get rocks
[2986.18s -> 2988.18s]  using a player sense
[2988.42s -> 2992.96s]  Wait, I oh
[2992.96s -> 2994.96s]  I have like I
[2995.08s -> 2997.08s]  Have like hitman vision
[2997.08s -> 3001.44s]  Jim the skill increase your strength by 50%
[3002.28s -> 3007.90s]  You can carry more materials with you in the tray without having to throw them away. Oh, that's a big deal. No
[3008.52s -> 3012.66s]  Alright, so we're gonna find rocks. Let's go look around collecting rocks
[3013.50s -> 3025.15s]  My gamer vision this game's awesome. Is it can I actually get attacked by a lion?
[3025.71s -> 3034.75s]  Okay, this is just MMO quest without the quest givers
[3035.11s -> 3039.73s]  I just have to go get like a hundred rocks and just go bring a hundred rocks here. I
[3042.10s -> 3055.75s]  Actually kind of like it. It's just arc. I mean, it's not really arc
[3056.17s -> 3071.66s]  This is probably more like lost arc than it is arc. This is a baby sensory game. It kind of feels like it
[3072.02s -> 3079.66s]  Good one. Thanks. I know that game is very relevant right now. It's my relevant game relevant gamer Andy
[3084.31s -> 3087.77s]  I'm just gonna do this for a little while. I
[3090.36s -> 3094.78s]  Kind of hope you can actually get attacked by a lion that would make the game a full letter grade higher for me
[3100.00s -> 3101.12s]  14
[3101.12s -> 3104.00s]  What if I can't do it? I don't have enough
[3104.72s -> 3108.60s]  Games really relaxing. Yeah, this game's good
[3109.24s -> 3111.40s]  This is it actually
[3111.40s -> 3117.71s]  all told our judgments, but I mean this is I like this just
[3120.42s -> 3134.77s]  Collect thing and bring thing here. It's so easy for me to understand one more. All right level up
[3137.22s -> 3138.78s]  Pick up the axe
[3138.78s -> 3146.05s]  What get closer to a palm tree with the axe equipped this melee attacks in this game?
[3146.73s -> 3157.56s]  Cut the palm tree down. Wow. Oh it falls into pieces
[3158.20s -> 3163.64s]  Pick up the log with E
[3163.64s -> 3165.62s]  Okay, cool
[3165.62s -> 3169.27s]  Um pick up a log. Wait, did I not?
[3169.79s -> 3191.00s]  There's no way to go. There's no way to do. I need to use my gamer sense. Thank you. Let it go
[3191.38s -> 3201.49s]  What oh I got to cut it. Are you serious?
[3202.13s -> 3213.21s]  Whoa, why am I talking like this is some huge innovation? Okay now
[3213.73s -> 3220.13s]  Some of these sticks up. I need more trees. Ah
[3222.14s -> 3234.48s]  You sound like you're experiencing life for the first time. It's kind of interesting
[3235.08s -> 3244.74s]  As go look at the steam store page for this. It's like cement trucks and shit
[3244.74s -> 3246.88s]  We are this is we're just scratching the surface
[3247.52s -> 3259.07s]  skill up
[3259.07s -> 3261.37s]  Faster tree cutting I'm gonna say oh
[3266.48s -> 3268.32s]  60% faster run speed
[3269.88s -> 3271.88s]  We're in a 30-second loop
[3271.92s -> 3291.56s]  Yeah, but it's a fun 30-second loop gameplay loops are okay if they're fun. They cut the music really didn't it still here
[3292.08s -> 3295.37s]  Alright, here we go. One two
[3296.17s -> 3297.41s]  There it is
[3297.41s -> 3300.16s]  New skill now, what do I do? Wait, there's more
[3300.72s -> 3310.47s]  The skill allow you to chop palms faster. Yep, where you do the same thing over and over again. Yeah, that's kind of it's relaxing
[3310.47s -> 3311.63s]  I like it
[3311.63s -> 3321.48s]  There are more trees
[3321.48s -> 3324.55s]  DMCA one turn on the furnace
[3325.03s -> 3337.71s]  What is there a free demo version of this game? I I don't know. What is this? I've like logs already here
[3338.41s -> 3350.68s]  Living in the 21st century doing something mean to it. What are you saying?
[3353.85s -> 3358.21s]  Living in the 21st century doing something mean to it better than anybody you ever seen screams from the haters
[3358.93s -> 3363.59s]  those are the lyrics I
[3365.96s -> 3367.96s]  Don't listen to any music
[3368.16s -> 3375.92s]  Because I think the last piece of music I listened to was like one of the attack on Titan intro songs
[3376.48s -> 3383.54s]  That's it that's it and then before that I think it was a radio on the radio I
[3384.02s -> 3398.04s]  Have a lot of these Twines
[3398.20s -> 3409.91s]  It's actually it's pretty helpful because it's kind of how it works, right? This is how you build a house
[3417.58s -> 3421.42s]  There there ain't no more trees I've cut them all down
[3425.55s -> 3431.61s]  Music's annoying me
[3432.05s -> 3435.41s]  Relax, it's you know, if you want to listen to like another 10 minutes
[3436.09s -> 3438.47s]  What's right? I like it. I think it's good
[3448.94s -> 3457.14s]  All right. Here we go. I think that should be in a good spot. Now we have to get those
[3458.98s -> 3460.94s]  Keep the construction from falling apart
[3460.94s -> 3466.66s]  You need to you need to tie logs together using rope made of tropical tree bark as you cut down trees
[3466.66s -> 3471.30s]  You may all have also found some tropical rope to collect the required amount and put it in the correct place
[3471.94s -> 3473.46s]  All right
[3473.46s -> 3476.92s]  Let's go
[3476.92s -> 3489.14s]  Build. Oh, there it is. Hey that tied it together. I
[3489.98s -> 3493.60s]  Did it?
[3493.60s -> 3499.26s]  Support for roof tiles in this stage. You also need palm logs collect them by cutting down trees as before
[3499.68s -> 3501.12s]  Do I have any?
[3501.12s -> 3506.66s]  Still have a few shit. I need more trees
[3507.28s -> 3514.20s]  That voice sounds like Joel
[3514.28s -> 3528.44s]  It does hold on. It sounds like Joel. I need to hear it. Let me just cut down a shit load of trees
[3529.12s -> 3542.84s]  Somebody just said fuck SNL and the whole cast what what are you talking about? What are you? Why saying that?
[3543.36s -> 3545.36s]  This is German. I need five
[3545.68s -> 3551.16s]  This is German stream. What what are you? Why are you saying that what happened? What are you doing? What happened?
[3551.60s -> 3561.89s]  Why are you saying that about I what does that do that? What does it do with me? I?
[3568.12s -> 3571.88s]  Keep thinking you guys are talking. All right. I'm so out of the loop with everything
[3573.65s -> 3575.65s]  completely out of the loop
[3575.85s -> 3580.68s]  100% I thought there's some guys coming in here going like hey, by the way, dude
[3580.68s -> 3584.92s]  Like fuck SNL and like fuck the whole bell cast just like all right, man, like what?
[3585.70s -> 3588.39s]  What do you want me to do about it? Why are you saying that to me?
[3588.99s -> 3607.84s]  I think there's enough trees rip the SNL sponsorship. I got it. You know what?
[3608.36s -> 3616.02s]  What are some sponsorships that I really would actually want? What should I say? What what should I get? What should I try to get?
[3616.46s -> 3618.25s]  biggest thing
[3618.25s -> 3621.79s]  Something that makes sense to me something that it makes sense to me
[3630.30s -> 3638.48s]  Donald's I would do that. Yeah, I would we I literally did that last stream and this is before
[3639.00s -> 3644.28s]  Doing anything with like a sponsorship or anything. I literally did a big a full like 10-minute McDonald's ad
[3644.96s -> 3647.60s]  I would do it. Yeah, that's a good one
[3649.00s -> 3657.38s]  Smarties guys if you think that smarties is going to pay some random dickhead streamer like me to do anything like you're out
[3657.38s -> 3659.38s]  Of your out of your mind
[3659.38s -> 3662.71s]  Skill increases your strength by a hundred percent
[3668.34s -> 3672.83s]  Got a shop now fence of logs
[3673.55s -> 3675.72s]  Or decoration. How about a fence of logs?
[3676.40s -> 3695.37s]  Should I put this? Okay. I got I got that twine. I can do this. I got a lot of it
[3695.69s -> 3711.10s]  Like the sounds all the sounds kind of make you remind you like you're collecting gems or something
[3711.88s -> 3715.60s]  I've got to do it like a bunch in a row
[3715.84s -> 3720.52s]  So it's like I walk in and I open up the crate and a bunch of gems fall out and I touch them all
[3720.52s -> 3722.48s]  In like one second, right?
[3722.48s -> 3725.42s]  That's good. That was good
[3726.14s -> 3731.39s]  That's good
[3732.84s -> 3735.50s]  All right time for some walls mix making mud
[3736.08s -> 3740.99s]  What do I have to do put mud in here and then fill it with water?
[3741.63s -> 3753.29s]  Pick up a shovel. It's some clay. Okay, put the clay into the basket
[3754.61s -> 3766.78s]  Got the wooden bowl scoop some scoop some water into bowl from scream
[3767.46s -> 3783.04s]  Or water in the basket. Whoa, I thought that said stuttering help like if the game is having a problem. Whoa, what is that?
[3783.48s -> 3785.00s]  fake reactions
[3785.00s -> 3787.76s]  Okay, so I can make clay
[3788.08s -> 3793.47s]  Mud shaper you have a basket full of clay and there's a block from near the stove
[3793.47s -> 3796.31s]  Take the clay out of the basket and put it into the form
[3797.03s -> 3813.45s]  What? Okay, cool. Now what? That's it. How much do I have to do? Oh my god. This is just like tasks the game. All right
[3814.03s -> 3833.64s]  There's gotta be a skill point I can do for this. Yeah, it's more mud blocks, please. I was really sus, but you just said
[3836.16s -> 3848.60s]  This way got it I went to school for bricking
[3852.16s -> 3855.93s]  You did
[3855.93s -> 3859.85s]  Did I just read another like like song lyric or something, what are you talking about?
[3859.85s -> 3872.74s]  I feel like I'm reading stuff that I don't I have no context of what's going on. Oh, hell. Yeah
[3873.34s -> 3874.76s]  Yeah
[3874.76s -> 3890.14s]  This is gonna take forever, but I'm obsessed. I'm studying right now. Can you please shut up for once? Yeah
[3890.66s -> 3896.52s]  I'll be quiet. You gotta here's thing though. If you're gonna you're gonna tell me to be quiet on my stream
[3898.54s -> 3912.38s]  You better get at least to see on that whatever it is. Oh, I need mud and now I need water
[3912.86s -> 3921.80s]  So you better get at least I didn't say be quiet. I said to get a see
[3922.44s -> 3944.25s]  Nice, that's so much better. Yeah mother nature. Yeah
[3947.42s -> 3950.78s]  HDTV presents the saw stream
[3957.67s -> 3967.06s]  You know what's funny though, I mean don't be surprised
[3967.98s -> 3974.40s]  Not necessarily that exact company, but that's kind of funny to me in its own way
[3974.84s -> 3983.56s]  How Franksburgers presents the diaper stream?
[3984.16s -> 4008.81s]  Like um, you know, you do you know you're signing up for you. That was always the plan cool
[4009.21s -> 4019.53s]  That's one wall done. I still have a lot. I gotta do that on all sides. Okay, and I hold the button
[4019.53s -> 4031.92s]  No, I mean for a cereal box game. This has great sound effects, which makes me want to continue to place the bricks
[4032.48s -> 4036.84s]  But under and by any means necessary
[4037.48s -> 4047.28s]  Right
[4047.28s -> 4055.43s]  Point you will form unimaginable more mud blocks at the same time and allows you to build brick after brick all the time
[4056.03s -> 4057.39s]  There it is
[4057.39s -> 4067.18s]  You're gonna play the new Goblin game
[4067.70s -> 4078.14s]  I don't know that is probably shouldn't be doing it like that. But that's what the tutorial did
[4078.38s -> 4080.82s]  Let's see what ungodly amounts look like
[4081.46s -> 4099.96s]  It's not that much. It ain't that much doesn't know you've not played the new goblin game
[4099.96s -> 4104.63s]  I can easily imagine that many bricks
[4105.23s -> 4122.65s]  I know like the fuck false advertising and shit. Are you gonna have?
[4123.60s -> 4133.62s]  Everyone what the fuck is going on? It's a game where you
[4134.30s -> 4136.54s]  You build houses. What do you?
[4137.10s -> 4147.74s]  What do you want me to tell you all games and all movies and all TV shows?
[4148.18s -> 4150.46s]  You could just say like what the fuck is going on
[4153.61s -> 4158.65s]  Something otherworldly or something that like well, this is not otherworldly but look you could say that about the Muppets
[4161.24s -> 4167.88s]  Okay, do you go do you turn the channel and you get on like Muppets take Manhattan and go what the fuck is going on?
[4168.28s -> 4171.00s]  With these like little weirdos. Who's that little green guy?
[4171.68s -> 4178.12s]  It's like a piece of media. You just you're gonna you could you'll figure it out. Somebody will help you you can enjoy it
[4178.64s -> 4184.12s]  Wait, wait, what the fuck's going on here that bear that bear can talk
[4184.76s -> 4191.28s]  Why does he sound like Yoda?
[4191.96s -> 4202.78s]  To voice Andy. I have a hundred and seventy four of these. Oh
[4202.86s -> 4217.48s]  Oh
[4217.48s -> 4231.11s]  Did not think I was gonna like that as much as I do. Holy shit. That was cool
[4231.11s -> 4239.56s]  All right, I gotta know was this you can form more mud blocks than you really need. That's fine. Just get it
[4240.36s -> 4251.98s]  Remember, what is your IRL house made out of and I think pretty much the same thing that everybody's IRL house is made out of
[4252.50s -> 4255.44s]  kitty litter and
[4255.92s -> 4259.25s]  That's it kitty litter and water
[4259.69s -> 4270.50s]  That's cement. All right. That's what it is. I'm like that
[4271.02s -> 4281.74s]  Wow, okay. Now that is actually a lot
[4282.34s -> 4300.54s]  That's a pretty decent amount zero. Can I make a ladder? How many clay balls do you think you could fit in a subway sandwich?
[4305.06s -> 4309.78s]  One I would assume maybe one
[4310.26s -> 4313.33s]  But that would just be the sandwich
[4313.37s -> 4326.99s]  It would just be two pieces of bread and a thing of clay, but you don't eat clay
[4326.99s -> 4332.29s]  I remember during the Halloween stream when bugleberry was
[4332.89s -> 4338.30s]  Eating spiders off of the table, which I'm not sure you could even see on the stream
[4338.70s -> 4342.26s]  But there was little spiders that were being pulled with string
[4342.86s -> 4345.34s]  Across the table and I was eating them with my hands
[4345.34s -> 4352.41s]  I mean I was back I was backstage like mimicking bugleberry like oh, that's what I want you to do like directing
[4353.82s -> 4358.46s]  But that's what I was supposed to be and I got a lot of comments
[4358.98s -> 4363.22s]  Saying bugleberry bugleberry. Don't put clay like that in your mouth. I
[4365.78s -> 4372.06s]  Remember I remember like, you know if if that were to be a mask, right which it's not that's somebody's skin
[4372.38s -> 4378.10s]  But if that was a mask that somebody was wearing which absolutely not the case
[4378.82s -> 4380.99s]  But if there was a mask
[4382.23s -> 4390.03s]  The clay that caked around their mouth like a little kid eating a chocolate bar that stayed there
[4393.80s -> 4397.51s]  For the whole BRB
[4398.07s -> 4399.59s]  Desperately wipe off
[4399.59s -> 4415.55s]  You know, it'd be kind of interesting. Don't eat clay by the way, like honestly
[4415.55s -> 4418.99s]  I think it actually people were saying it's like don't put any it's like actually fucking horrible
[4418.99s -> 4423.72s]  I don't remember why but I know it's just like don't fucking do that. Don't put it in your mouth
[4424.32s -> 4435.86s]  What's the actual like reason why something it's something like that plays just dust
[4436.38s -> 4444.20s]  Has a certain disease really? Yeah, I don't fuck around with that shit. Seriously don't
[4445.10s -> 4453.09s]  Really? I need one more
[4453.25s -> 4463.14s]  There we can pull that back that's minerals
[4463.66s -> 4473.50s]  Play from Minecraft. Yeah, that's where my that's where clay is from
[4474.14s -> 4487.73s]  Do we have a whole generation of kids that think that clay is from Minecraft? We don't right? What do I need?
[4488.35s -> 4491.15s]  Shape the tiles in the same way blocks
[4491.89s -> 4512.78s]  Using the mold on the other side of the basket where oh here. Okay, that's it
[4513.30s -> 4518.94s]  Wait shape the tiles in the same way to the blocks
[4519.38s -> 4521.56s]  But using the mold on the other side of the basket
[4521.68s -> 4527.60s]  Light up the furnace by putting some wood into the hole at its base. Finally put raw tiles through the chimney. Oh
[4528.54s -> 4530.22s]  That's what this is for
[4530.22s -> 4538.16s]  What would be what would be funnier?
[4538.32s -> 4543.32s]  What would even be funnier if is if kids hold on that went too fast
[4543.72s -> 4548.41s]  If it's the kids thought redstone was from Minecraft
[4549.05s -> 4556.34s]  You know, what's funny? I'm one of those kids. I thought I thought that that redstone was like a jokey thing that was made
[4557.02s -> 4559.20s]  Just made up for the game
[4559.20s -> 4566.73s]  It's not it is wait. It is
[4567.25s -> 4570.38s]  So what are you doing to me? Why are you making me look like an idiot?
[4570.90s -> 4589.98s]  I put this in put wood, right? How I do this earn on it cries wood to light a fire. So where is it?
[4590.34s -> 4593.87s]  Just hit right click. What is happening? Is it working? Oh
[4595.88s -> 4627.56s]  Where do they come out turn off the furnace? Where are they? I don't where are they skill points? I don't have any skills
[4627.92s -> 4631.25s]  You have to fill the whole thing up. Oh
[4632.45s -> 4634.09s]  Shit, okay. I see
[4634.09s -> 4648.27s]  Okay, little thing unit lost unit lost
[4648.99s -> 4652.35s]  unit lost
[4652.35s -> 4657.47s]  Destruction complete. Ooh
[4658.43s -> 4672.97s]  Can I reach all the way up there? I'm a girl mustache. I did I looked disgusting and I shaved it and I said never again
[4673.49s -> 4688.09s]  I'm just gonna do this for a little while because it's just kind of get that started. Yeah
[4688.67s -> 4694.67s]  grow a better mustache I
[4694.67s -> 4699.91s]  Can't really grow facial hair. I know that everybody says everybody I know. Yeah. Yeah
[4700.03s -> 4704.91s]  Dude, you're not doing it for long enough. You keep getting to like the
[4705.79s -> 4712.11s]  You just went through puberty and decided not to shave your face because maybe a you don't know how or
[4713.11s -> 4718.79s]  B you think it looks good. I know I'm at that I hit that stage, right and that's all it looks like
[4719.75s -> 4725.65s]  That's all it looks like for me. It never goes over that stage. I
[4726.17s -> 4733.94s]  Will go a month without shaving and it still looks like that. I need more
[4734.78s -> 4736.78s]  I need more this
[4763.95s -> 4787.05s]  Anybody else relaxed right now like wicked bad. I want some more coffee. Oh, what how much did you take?
[4788.81s -> 4806.57s]  We mean how much of what did I take coffee? I said one cup of coffee one. That's it
[4806.57s -> 4820.33s]  I saw all right. I want do we get to like the actual homes like houses like with concrete and
[4821.33s -> 4823.73s]  Floorboards and shit. I feel like that's gonna happen soon
[4824.33s -> 4837.24s]  All right, I can do this. I got 72. That should be enough. Ooh, look at this
[4837.76s -> 4851.94s]  Why are you changing the subject? What subject were we on? Are we on a subject? I don't remember the subject
[4860.18s -> 4871.30s]  Read a clock there guys. There are no clocks where I am. It's not it. There's no electricity
[4871.90s -> 4902.52s]  So I get up there. I stand on something. I can't stand on this. He's a look up. Oh, I can go inside right right right
[4903.12s -> 4914.82s]  Clock debacle. Yeah, I have not really taken any
[4915.74s -> 4922.17s]  THC since that I remember okay. I remember very specifically
[4923.17s -> 4929.04s]  So when I it's true. Well, actually New Year's Eve last year, right?
[4931.69s -> 4941.36s]  So when I did that and I looked back and I watched the clip and I knew how desperate I was to try to just like
[4941.36s -> 4942.60s]  Get the right time
[4942.60s -> 4945.48s]  So this is what I did. I
[4946.00s -> 4948.52s]  watched that footage back in my
[4949.12s -> 4953.24s]  I did the thing that you go like this, but you just can't believe it and you're so pissed because you look so stupid
[4953.84s -> 4959.77s]  Did one of these I went like this watching it I went
[4960.29s -> 4968.35s]  You know, you would wipe your fucking face because you keep like you just can't believe it
[4969.01s -> 4980.79s]  Just sitting there going that's what I was doing and I didn't want to have that reaction again
[4980.79s -> 4989.44s]  I was just rubbing my mouth going like God
[4990.74s -> 5002.64s]  And because I was looking at the chat and here's the thing everybody in the chat saying this has to be bullshit
[5003.46s -> 5005.26s]  This has to be made up
[5005.26s -> 5010.44s]  Right, like there's no way you are doing this not on purpose, right?
[5011.06s -> 5013.78s]  It's like fuck. I just look so stupid
[5014.70s -> 5020.24s]  but then I also had this same kind of
[5021.00s -> 5025.62s]  Epiphany a little bit here. I thought about this the other day. This is really interesting topic. I
[5027.19s -> 5033.27s]  Haven't been now this again. You're gonna say what does this have to do with reading a clock? That's like basic human knowledge
[5033.27s -> 5034.68s]  I
[5034.68s -> 5037.04s]  haven't been in a classroom
[5037.68s -> 5040.05s]  In almost 20 years
[5040.73s -> 5042.46s]  And I think about that a lot
[5042.46s -> 5047.30s]  I remember being in class and like the memory is so fleeting to me
[5047.86s -> 5050.84s]  it's such a distant memory of
[5052.44s -> 5054.44s]  doing essays and
[5055.32s -> 5057.32s]  problems and tests and
[5058.67s -> 5063.19s]  It's I it's a it's a fleeting memory and that's weird to think about
[5063.87s -> 5068.07s]  Because I remember like being up all night like fuck. I got a cram for this test
[5068.67s -> 5083.37s]  That's so long ago. What am I doing? It's a it's kind of a foreign concept, right?
[5084.01s -> 5087.77s]  What the fuck just happened? What are these done?
[5088.41s -> 5101.20s]  He's got he's actually finished. Um, I don't I don't think he's done. They are done. What have I been doing?
[5101.86s -> 5123.21s]  Muscle man. I mean, let's just get this one. Oh, I can jump but memory is a weird thing because that those memories from like
[5123.61s -> 5130.07s]  15 20 plus years ago. They're like they're like stopping existing
[5130.63s -> 5132.58s]  They're being
[5132.58s -> 5137.35s]  Like my hard drive is writing over that information in a way
[5137.83s -> 5144.29s]  Which is really bizarre to think about trust me when I tell you as somebody that's turning 37 this year
[5145.13s -> 5150.66s]  Once your hard drive starts to write over information from 20 years ago is when you're gonna start to look around and be like what?
[5151.18s -> 5172.23s]  Wow, I do this with this. He's right. Yeah
[5172.23s -> 5177.11s]  No, it's a weird feeling because I didn't have this feeling back in my let's say mid 20s, right?
[5177.75s -> 5187.36s]  In my mid to late 20s, it was kind of that was still not necessarily fresh in my mind, but it was still close
[5188.12s -> 5193.64s]  I'm approaching that period where being in school is a distant memory
[5194.32s -> 5209.69s]  Most on there. How many childhood memories do you think your brain deleted to replace with shitty internet memes?
[5210.25s -> 5217.46s]  You know, that's like kind of unfortunate if you really think about it, that's really kind of unfortunate
[5241.34s -> 5248.28s]  Okay, now I get it now I understand what you're talking about somebody is firing a gun at me I want to get a look at
[5248.28s -> 5253.45s]  It. Oh
[5253.45s -> 5264.94s]  Trapper house anymore. Ooh a half timbered house. Ooh
[5265.14s -> 5283.97s]  Any others that's the trapper house. I'm gonna do the half timber house watch movie
[5284.41s -> 5304.53s]  What wait, what do you mean watch movie? What I now watch the movie?
[5305.05s -> 5308.50s]  Okay, let's watch the movie
[5317.30s -> 5319.30s]  What is this a movie of
[5319.34s -> 5328.11s]  Wait, I don't watch somebody else's stream
[5328.79s -> 5334.31s]  Hey, by the way, you gotta up your bitrate man
[5334.87s -> 5337.11s]  You scream it up like fucking 500k
[5347.46s -> 5376.67s]  Trailer it's not out. I think this is early access or something. We just spoiling the whole thing. I don't want to see the whole thing
[5377.47s -> 5389.52s]  Showing me the whole house. I want to see the whole house
[5390.08s -> 5427.54s]  All you down I got a can all right. I need to know we just saw the whole thing get built
[5427.94s -> 5439.44s]  Okay. Well, that's not available
[5439.68s -> 5450.22s]  The other one is all right. Let's go to that one. This one's available sell
[5450.66s -> 5457.50s]  Wait, I bought it now. I sell it. Oh, I was gonna say what sledgehammer
[5458.14s -> 5467.10s]  Okay, unfortunately, you're on your own this time. There are no shops or any civilization here
[5467.14s -> 5469.46s]  You managed to bring the tools on a pickup truck
[5469.94s -> 5473.41s]  But you have to arrange the rest of the things you need for the construction of this house yourself
[5473.51s -> 5477.67s]  Hey Karen watch out for the bears. Good luck. Stop saying that there's no animals in this game
[5478.47s -> 5484.47s]  Stopper building a trappers house from the foundations. I thought they weren't gonna help me
[5485.07s -> 5488.48s]  Yeah, okay. That's like if dark souls
[5489.24s -> 5491.24s]  Would it be like
[5492.64s -> 5498.96s]  Here we are fire link shrine you're on your own motherfucker. Good luck. It's dark souls. It's hard as shit
[5498.96s -> 5504.52s]  And we don't help you and then I walk up to the first enemy and I take a swing and the game
[5505.20s -> 5514.64s]  pauses and this three one two three on the screen images with different paragraphs under each image
[5516.07s -> 5521.15s]  Explaining how to swing the weapon. That's what they're doing here. I leave me alone
[5521.83s -> 5528.62s]  Which look I gotta be honest. I said this the other day. I said if I'm not playing the VR stuff, too
[5529.22s -> 5532.49s]  like the video game tutorial
[5532.81s -> 5539.43s]  Just tell me how to just do I do you do I really need to be told how to swing the weapon?
[5539.83s -> 5544.44s]  It's left click in every single video game
[5545.18s -> 5551.02s]  Like can you just give me like a cheat sheet with all the buttons on it?
[5551.02s -> 5556.71s]  I don't know why we still have to go and remember right click is aim
[5557.27s -> 5566.65s]  You don't have to tell me that like just show it to me. What is the first game ever? It's not it's
[5567.37s -> 5572.53s]  This should be we need to have like a I don't know. Why would that be your first game ever? It's not
[5573.25s -> 5591.45s]  Left click is a do thing every game. All right. Let me see what this says. There should be a tutorial game
[5591.73s -> 5595.61s]  Yeah, there should be like steam should come up with an app that you can download
[5595.61s -> 5602.89s]  That's just like getting started with gaming and you put just have every game follow the same fucking basic rules
[5602.89s -> 5605.17s]  And you can open up this like steam
[5605.73s -> 5607.29s]  how to
[5607.29s -> 5612.26s]  remember most games have left click as their means of
[5613.14s -> 5615.14s]  attacking and or shooting and
[5616.20s -> 5619.96s]  Then the game can come up. It could be like here we go. Here's the tutorial. Here we go
[5620.48s -> 5626.92s]  Instead of spending like six plus hours tutorialing me just please refer to the steam workshop app
[5627.52s -> 5630.36s]  tutorial if you don't know how to use a computer and
[5630.84s -> 5636.54s]  Then we can shave the first six fucking hours of just stretching to add
[5636.78s -> 5641.10s]  Cutscenes to tutorials to make it worth showing so the developers don't feel like
[5641.66s -> 5644.42s]  We're gonna have we have to spend two hours telling people how to play the game
[5644.98s -> 5649.38s]  We have to make up like a fucking story that they can play through in the tutorial. They don't have to do that anymore
[5649.98s -> 5659.86s]  Just get to the good stuff get to the meat. Can we watch the new five nights at Freddy's video?
[5660.50s -> 5664.78s]  No, we're not watching five nights at Freddy's you're watching Jerma
[5666.26s -> 5669.26s]  This place sucks. So you picked a good one
[5669.78s -> 5676.08s]  Alright, we'll start building a Trappers house from the foundations. These are logs that are well embedded in the soil, right?
[5676.60s -> 5679.73s]  You can get the logs by cutting these trees. Oh
[5681.09s -> 5683.42s]  It's a deer
[5683.42s -> 5699.95s]  You move fast. There's pigs. Wait. Why did you develop pigs? Why have pigs and like animals?
[5700.47s -> 5716.25s]  Okay, let's go back to what I was saying. Oh shit, it's just like minecraft. I don't know where my house is. There it is
[5716.71s -> 5718.80s]  Can I get in the car?
[5718.80s -> 5724.56s]  Please tell me I can drive the truck. Can I please it's okay
[5725.08s -> 5730.12s]  All right. What the fuck am I doing? I need to read this
[5732.26s -> 5738.84s]  Please refer to the steam tutorial app gaming for beginners. I would probably flip out right now
[5739.48s -> 5742.24s]  Yeah, imagine if that's what it told me
[5745.26s -> 5746.82s]  Suck so much
[5746.82s -> 5753.07s]  Okay, you can get the logs by cutting trees nearby. Remember that you have to cut logs by chainsaw
[5753.71s -> 5760.39s]  Okay, yes to blueprint size and of course debark each log with draw shave
[5761.23s -> 5771.49s]  Good, I'm gonna cut down logs
[5772.17s -> 5784.08s]  these down
[5784.08s -> 5785.84s]  script scree
[5785.84s -> 5788.52s]  Scree, what is that to change just a scroll scroll?
[5791.14s -> 5795.70s]  I thought it was spacebar. No, I thought it was spray spray
[5796.26s -> 5797.54s]  scrape bar
[5797.54s -> 5805.01s]  Am I doing this wrong? Oh
[5805.33s -> 5813.45s]  What do I do? He's a one point one five in length
[5814.58s -> 5838.72s]  What that's way bigger than that and that's huge. What is going on? Oh
[5842.00s -> 5845.20s]  Thank you. Thank you so much. Here it is
[5845.76s -> 5856.88s]  This is it right here. I'll need a chainsaw. Here it is. All right, here's my best chainsaw impression
[5861.36s -> 5863.36s]  I
[5870.85s -> 5894.29s]  Just picked up the whole tree. Oh fuck. Now what do I do? I'm a forester and I'm impressed. Hey, thanks
[5894.29s -> 5902.80s]  Oh shit. Okay, this may
[5903.20s -> 5913.40s]  Know that's too big. These look like it looks like dog sausages
[5913.76s -> 5919.21s]  No, if you guys have ever had combos, okay, it needs to be that tall
[5919.73s -> 5926.90s]  How tall is this?
[5926.90s -> 5950.86s]  1.5. That's not even right. Why is it doing this? It's like 0.65. Okay right there. All right, got it
[5953.56s -> 5977.98s]  That right. What am I supposed to do with this shit? Oh, I have to debark it. How do I do that?
[5978.18s -> 6016.17s]  How do I debark it like that? Oh, I actually have to move my hand. I was gonna say what's going on
[6016.45s -> 6021.11s]  All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it
[6021.63s -> 6042.92s]  He's learning you said everything is left-click. No, okay. There's a difference between adding a game mechanic later
[6043.76s -> 6044.92s]  right
[6044.92s -> 6047.60s]  But even adding the game mechanics
[6047.80s -> 6054.92s]  We spend so much time telling you how to play rather than letting you play Dark Souls greatest game franchise of all time
[6055.28s -> 6075.57s]  It's already done. It's too big. No, these are perfect. No tutorial Andy. That one was not even the right size
[6076.13s -> 6078.44s]  Guys actually doesn't even matter
[6091.76s -> 6101.60s]  No, it doesn't a couple more of these logs
[6102.52s -> 6108.91s]  Yeah, that's five says it's a whatever guy. That's not that tall says size doesn't matter
[6109.67s -> 6121.20s]  You're wicked funny. You're wicked funny. You're gonna ever do the wink redemption thing again
[6121.72s -> 6126.84s]  Let me ask you a question. So back when I had the wink redemption channel points
[6127.32s -> 6131.93s]  There were probably three thousand concurrent four thousand concurrent people here like a year or two ago
[6132.53s -> 6137.28s]  There are almost 19,000 people watching the stream
[6138.36s -> 6140.36s]  Turning winks back on would
[6140.48s -> 6147.14s]  That would be the broadcast would be over. It would be only wink redemptions the entire stream. It would never
[6147.66s -> 6155.38s]  Be anything else ever because it already was all I was doing back when I had a third of the audience
[6156.02s -> 6171.72s]  There would be unbearable. That was a flex. It's not a flex. I'm just whatever just make them really expensive
[6172.32s -> 6183.71s]  Do one please fine. Okay. I will do one wink into the I will wink into the camera
[6184.09s -> 6187.57s]  If you guys without any like mod help
[6188.15s -> 6194.32s]  Right now like oh we can clear the chat. I don't want to see a chat message of
[6195.32s -> 6201.02s]  Ten whole seconds. I want the chat to stop and I don't want it to move. I
[6201.70s -> 6205.40s]  Want no one to write anything for a full ten seconds and I'll do it
[6210.44s -> 6219.95s]  No, not dot dot dots just nothing in the chat it's just frozen and that's not moving
[6220.39s -> 6231.46s]  This game has animals that are more detailed than Red Dead Redemption 2
[6232.06s -> 6251.29s]  That's actually a really well-made elk. There's a Fox to shut up. Yeah, I see how easy it is to get you to keep talking
[6251.95s -> 6266.18s]  Wait, it's doing it for me. I fucked that up. So bad. The game was like, you know what don't worry about it
[6266.18s -> 6271.62s]  I'm gonna do it for you
[6272.26s -> 6276.06s]  Scared me. All right, use a chainsaw. Uh-huh
[6276.66s -> 6284.57s]  All right. We're not playing that game anymore. You also prepare the next logs in the same way
[6284.57s -> 6288.89s]  You're cutting another tree you bark them from the bark with a special tool and then you cover the chainsaw
[6289.45s -> 6298.01s]  Okay, this is cool. Do I need this?
[6298.61s -> 6304.60s]  We have to debark this you bark it
[6305.20s -> 6316.20s]  Well, that's way better than what I was doing. I did that in the probably dumbest possible way, but guys size doesn't even matter
[6316.20s -> 6324.79s]  What?
[6324.79s -> 6343.93s]  Alright now I'm making it bread. I can make wood salami
[6345.25s -> 6364.60s]  Make it thinner. Can you make it thinner, please? I love
[6364.80s -> 6367.12s]  In slices of deli meat
[6368.08s -> 6374.28s]  Let's be honest when the person behind the counter holds it up and goes, is this all right?
[6374.80s -> 6380.42s]  You just say yes, you know what I mean? Like what does it really matter that much?
[6381.30s -> 6391.39s]  Like honestly if you for a lot of the people that go to the deli and they go
[6391.39s -> 6396.69s]  Um, can you make it super super thin for me and they do it and they show it up and they go
[6396.69s -> 6399.89s]  Mmm, I think a little bit thinner than that, please and they go. Okay
[6400.37s -> 6404.77s]  They could probably just put the same piece of salami up and they would think it was fine
[6405.57s -> 6421.31s]  Like oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll do it. How's this? Oh, that's much better. All right. What am I stop doing this?
[6421.31s -> 6423.55s]  I need to like actually cut this correctly. How far is this?
[6424.11s -> 6429.80s]  two point two point nine meters
[6430.32s -> 6433.72s]  Alright, I gotta get this is all trash now. I gotta get rid of this
[6434.20s -> 6439.82s]  Like when the person at the deli counter just kind of goes, hey, is that alright? I
[6440.38s -> 6445.98s]  Mean if it's way too thick you just be like, oh, can you like a little bit thinner like I or before they even start
[6445.98s -> 6447.82s]  Cutting it you go. Can you make it thin?
[6447.82s -> 6475.39s]  That's it face came on. We've been good. Mm-hmm. It's my house. Oh, there it is. Okay. Oh
[6478.36s -> 6490.12s]  Cute Fox is getting nighttime. Alright, stop. I need to cut trees down
[6493.25s -> 6499.27s]  Now I need two point eight meters
[6499.83s -> 6509.22s]  Starting here. How many can I get out of this this two point nine right there? I can get probably three
[6509.98s -> 6512.22s]  All right, two point nine got it
[6512.50s -> 6516.00s]  It's gonna take forever. I'm not giving up
[6520.44s -> 6533.22s]  That close enough for this two point nine. I can do it twice two point nine. There it is
[6535.77s -> 6551.50s]  So it's three equal pieces, I don't need to measure anymore just do three equal pieces
[6551.94s -> 6565.18s]  Hey, pick it up. What? Oh god. Damn it. It's that that didn't okay
[6565.86s -> 6580.69s]  Then that's outer edge. Well, that's a whole tree. That's the whole thing. All right, cut another one down. I got it now
[6581.41s -> 6583.01s]  Oh
[6583.01s -> 6590.04s]  Three equal parts. Wait
[6591.24s -> 6595.05s]  Skin this thing. That's way better. Okay, so much faster
[6595.81s -> 6597.52s]  one
[6597.52s -> 6599.52s]  two three
[6599.76s -> 6628.58s]  That's enough. I wasn't even the right piece. It's actually too short
[6640.61s -> 6643.05s]  2.9. All right, fine. Let me just do this
[6643.81s -> 6654.39s]  Okay, just scaled all this
[6659.00s -> 6677.08s]  2.9
[6677.08s -> 6680.47s]  Thank God a skill
[6681.72s -> 6683.52s]  automatic log measurement
[6683.52s -> 6687.54s]  Thank goodness. Oh
[6687.54s -> 6688.94s]  Thank God
[6688.94s -> 6690.94s]  What a disaster this would have been
[6691.02s -> 6710.49s]  Perfect. Okay, two point nine nice log, bro. I you know, I hate that people are called shit a log
[6711.09s -> 6716.28s]  That's I hate it. It just seems so
[6716.92s -> 6719.88s]  So dumb and gross. It's just so awful
[6720.64s -> 6748.11s]  Alright, the rest of these are big for this one. No. Oh, is this too short? It's not this is big
[6748.83s -> 6757.52s]  Too short. It's not too short. I got to measure this again because like what the heck
[6760.92s -> 6766.83s]  4.7 easy or
[6769.07s -> 6773.45s]  7
[6773.45s -> 6787.39s]  There it is. We're seven
[6787.99s -> 6804.69s]  Okay, this one should fit too. What's that song from a Red Dead? Oh
[6805.29s -> 6808.57s]  We're having a little fun. They will have a little how we're building
[6809.29s -> 6817.57s]  Build all things and we have a little happen. Whatever it is. I love that song
[6818.01s -> 6833.18s]  Keep picking up the same piece of wood. In fact, just start over. Give me another one
[6835.59s -> 6839.29s]  Need
[6839.29s -> 6854.45s]  Two that are how long stop stop stop
[6854.97s -> 6859.28s]  Or for whatever for or something
[6868.05s -> 6875.27s]  That should do it. Oh
[6875.47s -> 6877.74s]  you
[6877.74s -> 6897.17s]  When are you going to ancient Egypt? I don't know
[6897.69s -> 6903.41s]  You also prefer the next logs in the same way. You're cutting another tree you debark them more of this
[6904.25s -> 6908.92s]  Automatic laser measurement. Ooh
[6910.91s -> 6917.29s]  How long is this? These are all art. Thank you five
[6918.93s -> 6923.30s]  All right, four point six four point six four point six four point six
[6923.30s -> 6933.86s]  I need for this will fit here one of these will already got all this scrap. I will use it
[6934.42s -> 6949.79s]  Thank you. Thanks for the help. Thanks Luigi. Okay. Now this is all right four point six four point six four point six
[6950.31s -> 6959.02s]  Is a bear staring at me?
[6964.40s -> 6975.77s]  That's a cat or there's just pigs
[6976.41s -> 6995.48s]  There's no bear. No, that's a pig guys. This is like a warthog
[6999.78s -> 7005.78s]  Can't do it
[7005.82s -> 7014.02s]  Shaving them automatically. Oh
[7021.69s -> 7034.34s]  You can fuck up by 30% perfect. Yep. We're good. Oh hell. Yeah, he doesn't even matter Luigi's gonna help me
[7041.54s -> 7061.14s]  That's so incorrect. You sure? All right, what about over here? If it's too long, they just end up cutting it and helping you
[7061.14s -> 7083.49s]  So it's fine. Watch out. There's a hair. There's a herobrine. Oh, no one more
[7091.43s -> 7093.23s]  Herobrine
[7093.23s -> 7101.54s]  What does herobrine even do he doesn't need to stare at you with red eyes or something and he's like kills you
[7101.94s -> 7105.90s]  He's a huge. Okay more of this
[7108.04s -> 7117.39s]  I did not put that there. It's weird
[7126.21s -> 7146.75s]  There's not a bear
[7146.75s -> 7160.58s]  I'm actually glad there's doing this because I can just put these two here. Be sure not this one
[7161.14s -> 7165.56s]  All right, one more and I'm gonna have to start making actual planks
[7176.39s -> 7181.95s]  There's even more that does sound like you'll like a lot
[7182.49s -> 7195.21s]  Okay, I gotta put some more logs down here. I think it's honestly I think it's time to do this
[7195.21s -> 7198.61s]  I have to cut down just like ten trees and stack them over here
[7200.33s -> 7205.54s]  You can play cruelty squad, I don't know I don't have like a plan to but
[7206.18s -> 7215.40s]  I
[7216.40s -> 7225.59s]  Appreciate the sport. Thank you. So also keep in mind. We also have AI dungeon
[7226.15s -> 7232.99s]  And that I'm gonna be playing probably soon here. I have novel AI and AI dungeon both ready to go
[7233.75s -> 7241.62s]  Like I said before I kind of like this
[7241.78s -> 7245.02s]  Play something for a few hours move to something else for like an hour or two play something for an hour
[7245.02s -> 7252.32s]  I kind of kind of like it now, obviously some games would not you can't do that. I kind of like this. It's fun
[7252.36s -> 7271.74s]  It's fun to jump around I'm gonna say two more. I still need another coffee. Well, the squad has stocks
[7272.66s -> 7273.94s]  Really?
[7273.94s -> 7297.23s]  You mean I could trade I think that's good be three more too short. Oh my goodness
[7297.79s -> 7316.33s]  This is next level. All right, still need the big ones. Yep. That's too short. There we go
[7316.75s -> 7323.79s]  How many can I carry I can carry this many? I didn't know that
[7324.47s -> 7327.22s]  Graphics are all that matter in video games
[7327.54s -> 7330.30s]  Um, not really I
[7331.06s -> 7337.01s]  Would disagree with you on that and the most fun I've ever had was a game
[7337.69s -> 7341.85s]  That looked like it was from like 2004 like 2006
[7342.49s -> 7347.95s]  Some games are like 2d pixel graphics and I found them amazing
[7348.79s -> 7353.46s]  Companies care way too much about graphics
[7353.94s -> 7359.02s]  Way too much if the driving factor for the huge amount of things that you play
[7359.86s -> 7371.64s]  About Mario Superstar Baseball
[7371.84s -> 7376.60s]  Mario strikers is I'm looking forward to that that game was amazing
[7377.28s -> 7389.82s]  Especially that what they had a sequel, right? It was really good. What are some of the things I'm looking forward to?
[7391.25s -> 7393.01s]  Elden Ring, obviously
[7393.01s -> 7413.58s]  When does Elden Ring come out? When is the actual launch on Steam? Yeah, but what time who knows?
[7413.58s -> 7417.70s]  I wonder if it's gonna be like 1 p.m. Or something or it's opening at midnight
[7417.70s -> 7419.42s]  The day before
[7419.42s -> 7442.01s]  Supposed to be on the 24th. I'll be Thursday at 9. I'm definitely I'm not doing a midnight launch release thingy
[7442.01s -> 7460.86s]  You know, I got these really good sections here. It's a fair type of craft beer. I don't really drink craft beer
[7460.86s -> 7463.23s]  I don't drink really beer at all
[7463.79s -> 7470.06s]  Every time I drink beer. I take two or three sips out of it when it's really cold
[7470.70s -> 7472.90s]  And I go. Oh
[7472.90s -> 7478.86s]  Mmm. Oh, that's good. Oh man guys. Oh mine's good. What'd you get? Oh, mine's the mine's the
[7478.90s -> 7482.58s]  Orange peel the orange peel. What's it? I I don't have any fucking idea. Just picked one. Oh
[7483.26s -> 7485.34s]  It's the orange peel IPA from
[7485.82s -> 7491.82s]  From Germany. Yeah, and then it gets kind of a little warmer and I I don't like to drink it
[7491.82s -> 7497.26s]  But I have to because it's like you don't you can't like order a full beer in like the nice glass
[7497.78s -> 7502.38s]  Take two sips of it and just stare at it. Like I don't yeah, you have to get at least halfway done
[7503.10s -> 7507.06s]  right, so
[7507.62s -> 7510.30s]  Also, well, I don't know why everyone's so weird. Why are we so weird?
[7511.06s -> 7513.87s]  Humans are a weird group of animals
[7516.42s -> 7521.62s]  I know we like want other people to enjoy the things we enjoy
[7522.46s -> 7527.99s]  But but do we really have to say that they that you think the ketchup is house made?
[7528.59s -> 7529.67s]  right
[7529.67s -> 7531.97s]  Like hmm. Oh, dude. No, this ketchup's house made
[7532.53s -> 7534.95s]  It's no stop. It never is
[7535.87s -> 7545.51s]  Ever probably maybe in a few places like dude that honey mustard. Oh, man. Oh
[7546.39s -> 7549.39s]  Yep, oh man, that's it. That's it. They made they make that here. They make that in house
[7549.39s -> 7555.85s]  I wonder how many times like a restaurateur has heard that come from somebody and they just open up the fridge
[7556.01s -> 7558.57s]  There's just bottles of like Heinz ketchup in there
[7559.13s -> 7574.92s]  Yeah, it sure is. I've never heard that. What are you talking about? Everybody says that like oh this beer. Oh, mm-hmm
[7574.92s -> 7576.92s]  I this is so good
[7577.80s -> 7581.08s]  Do you see where it's from? It's from this from Italy
[7581.66s -> 7585.70s]  Yeah, it is
[7592.27s -> 7594.42s]  Italian beer
[7594.42s -> 7599.10s]  Ranch restaurant ranch. Oh my god. It's so good. Oh, by the way ranch Andy's in chat
[7599.10s -> 7601.98s]  I got a bone to pick with you. I got a bone to pick with you guys
[7602.78s -> 7608.94s]  So a few days ago on this stream. We talked about how oh mayonnaise. Eww yuck mayo
[7609.50s -> 7612.18s]  all you ranch enjoyers I
[7613.14s -> 7615.14s]  think need to take a step back and
[7615.58s -> 7617.66s]  Evaluate how you feel about mayonnaise
[7618.50s -> 7624.40s]  Because if I if you think that mayonnaise is gross you better think that ranch is gross, too
[7625.20s -> 7629.98s]  Because that shit is like kind of disgusting if you think about it. Just like if you think about mayonnaise
[7636.80s -> 7638.24s]  unseasoned ranch
[7638.24s -> 7646.33s]  Uh-huh
[7646.33s -> 7652.17s]  Unseasoned ranch that's so funny. Excuse me, sir. Would you like some unseasoned ranch, please or fucking mayonnaise?
[7652.89s -> 7667.16s]  Don't care omega. Well don't care
[7667.60s -> 7673.22s]  Ranch actually tastes good. No ranch tastes like ranch
[7673.86s -> 7677.28s]  Mayo makes everything else taste better
[7677.98s -> 7685.87s]  Mayo brings out flavors ranch is ranch
[7686.63s -> 7695.88s]  Not that I'm saying I don't just I dislike ranch, but I mean I can't say I'm like I love it
[7696.88s -> 7703.47s]  I'm actually one of those
[7703.79s -> 7708.55s]  Giga Chad blue cheese enjoyers instead of ranch. I choose blue cheese every time
[7709.11s -> 7720.57s]  If there's a choice between blue cheese or ranch for like a dipping sauce for something I'm gonna choose blue cheese
[7720.57s -> 7726.26s]  I don't know that's kind of I can understand why people think blue cheese is gross, but it doesn't matter
[7726.90s -> 7728.90s]  To me. I just I know
[7729.14s -> 7731.14s]  Don't stop saying giga Chad
[7731.78s -> 7738.20s]  You guys say it all the time. You don't think I'm gonna like at least absorb some of that. Of course I am
[7740.42s -> 7747.67s]  Aoli, yeah, isn't that taste so good that mayonnaise that has like other shit in it like this like a it's like they
[7748.05s -> 7754.56s]  They ground up some garlic and put it in mayonnaise and you love it now. That's garlic mayonnaise
[7754.74s -> 7761.82s]  And holy smokes is that good? Oh
[7763.85s -> 7768.82s]  Eat I could eat garlic mayo out of the jar. I probably could
[7769.34s -> 7775.27s]  Like oh, just put it on bread. I think blue cheese is better than ranch
[7775.79s -> 7778.03s]  There's stuff that I would put ranch on instead of blue cheese
[7778.51s -> 7786.10s]  Should I like do an eating stream where I like eat stuff and write it for you?
[7786.62s -> 7795.21s]  I've seen people do this before you want my real dog shit takes on everything
[7795.21s -> 7810.06s]  Oh, what's like a one that you'd want to see your TV dinners?
[7810.58s -> 7827.67s]  Hmm you want to do a TV dinner stream get a bunch of them you dog sausages dog treats
[7828.63s -> 7841.65s]  That's so stupid dog treat tier list live so many people do like the
[7842.21s -> 7844.85s]  taste test stuff imagine if I had like
[7845.49s -> 7847.49s]  milk bones and
[7847.65s -> 7850.01s]  like dog sausages and like
[7850.57s -> 7853.01s]  Canned dog food and shit and I sat there and I did that
[7853.57s -> 7860.70s]  With special guess at all. I don't have to give his tier list
[7861.28s -> 7865.24s]  And how we do that is I take a few dog treats. I break them up
[7865.24s -> 7870.24s]  So they're really small right so he doesn't get like too much so break them up to the little small taste pieces
[7870.88s -> 7875.40s]  Put them out in a row far enough away from each other said so he has to decide I
[7877.47s -> 7881.43s]  Hold him back as like the other end of the room and go okay
[7881.43s -> 7887.82s]  Go watch out and see what he goes for first that is now elevated on the tier list, right?
[7888.18s -> 7893.60s]  So then that's like up at like s tier we put that next to another one, right?
[7894.12s -> 7898.16s]  That he also likes and we make a dog treat tier list
[7898.72s -> 7904.81s]  One thing I'd want to make sure of though is that whatever it was
[7905.43s -> 7907.82s]  It was gonna be
[7907.82s -> 7915.45s]  Very very small amounts like tiny little little pieces because I don't want to sit there and just like feed him bags of treats
[7916.17s -> 7924.26s]  He's saying this, but he's never gonna do it. No. Don't you understand?
[7925.08s -> 7929.70s]  Always remember the things I say because two years from now. I'm gonna spend
[7930.60s -> 7932.60s]  $40,000 on this as a project
[7933.21s -> 7936.07s]  You know what I mean? Like just wait a year or two. There'll be like a
[7936.77s -> 7938.95s]  $70,000 stream where this happens
[7941.58s -> 7943.58s]  Just wait a few years
[7949.65s -> 7956.30s]  That would be actually kind of fun as long as that was done right and it wasn't I wasn't overfeeding him and overdoing it
[7956.30s -> 7957.74s]  I think that'd be funny
[7957.74s -> 7968.11s]  Make a dog treat tier list. No, but the thing is I wouldn't just do the dogs like food tier list
[7968.57s -> 7972.09s]  Like in the middle of that stream
[7972.45s -> 7977.09s]  Macho man Randy Savage has to show up and like eat out of the can with his hands
[7977.37s -> 7982.93s]  And go like whoo. Yeah, and then leave and like I just have to blow money on that stream, right?
[7982.93s -> 7984.93s]  Like I have somebody has to come in and do something weird
[7985.45s -> 7992.94s]  Well, like I have to like be like come here I talk and I have to like fall out of my window
[7993.38s -> 8011.22s]  Like it can't just be a stream where we just do something like basic like that. I'll think about it. I'll think about it
[8011.22s -> 8012.58s]  That's not kind of like a fun idea
[8012.58s -> 8015.97s]  Then we'll find out once and for all
[8016.47s -> 8027.73s]  No, I know not my I'm not saying macho man
[8027.73s -> 8031.73s]  I'm saying like a like celebrity or like a somebody or a thing needs to happen
[8031.89s -> 8055.07s]  That's not just Otto eating dog treats this is coming along Otto is a celebrity, you know, that's true
[8072.16s -> 8078.56s]  I have to start to get it. I gotta use the ladder
[8078.80s -> 8088.69s]  But okay for me, what would you guys want to see me eat? I would do one of these
[8089.13s -> 8104.63s]  There's an endless amount of content here. It's a mess in here roots. Okay, I'm not gonna eat dog food. No
[8105.31s -> 8127.10s]  Okay, you okay. I see a few decent ones. I see a few good ones
[8138.15s -> 8142.90s]  Is this long enough? I need a full tree for that one
[8143.60s -> 8151.87s]  There we go. Good dipping sauce tier list
[8151.87s -> 8158.16s]  I mean I'll do I'll start with one if you guys like it and I maybe I'll do another one
[8158.64s -> 8167.71s]  Canned soups. That's not that's actually a really good one because that's really easy to make
[8168.27s -> 8174.82s]  That's legitimately just heating up soup. So I don't have to do a bunch of bullshit where
[8175.46s -> 8183.72s]  I'm actually kind of into that one. You're gonna have too much sodium
[8184.28s -> 8192.46s]  Well, no, I'm not gonna eat like 40 cans of soup. I'm gonna portion it out
[8192.46s -> 8194.46s]  So it's little taste test versions
[8194.62s -> 8201.08s]  Cover them up put them in the fridge and then be able to eat them over the course of like a week or like a month
[8201.58s -> 8203.82s]  How long I can keep it in the fridge for?
[8205.32s -> 8212.30s]  As when they do the coca-cola versus Pepsi taste test you don't drain a 2-liter to make that decision
[8214.55s -> 8217.83s]  Contrary to what the commercials of a lot of those products would like you to believe
[8218.31s -> 8224.03s]  How many soda commercials do you see where they just tip the thing up and fucking slam it?
[8224.75s -> 8227.12s]  Every time I see that happen. I go. Ow
[8227.88s -> 8229.48s]  that hurts
[8229.48s -> 8242.59s]  Always like in the middle of a jingle, right? It's like cool refreshing taste and they
[8243.59s -> 8245.35s]  It's like a guy on a beach
[8245.35s -> 8248.03s]  tips it back his head slams back and he is like
[8249.03s -> 8272.99s]  an ocean water tier list like the Atlantic versus the Pacific
[8273.55s -> 8281.38s]  You're gonna go go to like the Red Sea and be on camera. All right, here we are. Let's find out where this fits it. Oh
[8285.42s -> 8288.54s]  This one's kind of this one tastes a little bit different. This one's a little nutty
[8289.06s -> 8302.78s]  Let me tell you that's a way for a youtuber to write off a huge vacation. Okay, so just be aware of that
[8302.78s -> 8307.51s]  Oh where I got how I'm gonna travel the whole world
[8308.51s -> 8316.88s]  To take sips out of different bodies of water, isn't that crazy? I have to go to 30 countries
[8319.82s -> 8322.48s]  It's for the video man
[8336.59s -> 8354.22s]  Deductions oh, yeah, this house just looks like uncooked hot dogs. Oh breadsticks
[8355.54s -> 8364.30s]  This house is making me hungry. It just looks like breadsticks. I want to dump some fucking ranch on these things here. You know, I mean
[8364.94s -> 8370.19s]  What about a cereal tier list?
[8370.51s -> 8385.05s]  Yeah, but I already know where I stand on that. I know it completely where I stand. I already did that
[8385.05s -> 8387.05s]  Yeah, but I mean I didn't eat the cereal on stream
[8392.38s -> 8399.08s]  What about like a Yankee candle tier list or like a bed bath and beyond candle tier list?
[8399.08s -> 8401.08s]  I just sit there and I'm like, oh
[8401.40s -> 8411.26s]  This one's alright
[8411.26s -> 8415.94s]  That would suck you would never get the smell out of that room
[8419.20s -> 8420.40s]  Okay
[8420.40s -> 8422.56s]  Crayon you just made me spit on my monitor
[8423.24s -> 8426.12s]  Crayon flavor tier list like I think they're flavors
[8426.12s -> 8435.54s]  I don't think that they're just like fun names for colors and actually talk make them out of something that's edible
[8436.10s -> 8440.78s]  like have a fake box of like 500 crayons made lay them all out and eat them and
[8441.30s -> 8444.30s]  But they're actually made out of like an edible material that I can eat
[8444.90s -> 8450.77s]  That would freak out a ton. A lot of people would be fucking freaked out by that big time. I
[8451.37s -> 8455.98s]  Actually might get like a message from twitch like hey
[8456.72s -> 8458.72s]  What are you doing? Stop doing this?
[8458.92s -> 8483.16s]  He's all too short. Hey, it looks good. How often do you get those messages? Um
[8484.32s -> 8493.86s]  Okay, but this is a cool idea and I don't want to just ruin it and leak it in case I ever do it
[8493.86s -> 8501.06s]  I don't want to like leak it and talk about the whole entire thing because I think it's really funny and
[8501.18s -> 8504.84s]  One day I might actually be able to do it right it's possible
[8505.24s -> 8510.08s]  So I don't want to like leak it what it is and maybe I've talked about a little bit before but I'm
[8510.96s -> 8515.83s]  Just in case that this stream actually happens ever
[8516.41s -> 8522.60s]  I'm gonna hold on to it. But yeah, there was there was there was something that I wanted to do
[8523.28s -> 8525.28s]  but it was just like
[8525.64s -> 8527.32s]  Not a big fan
[8527.32s -> 8532.17s]  But I think we could have done it. I think we might have had to tweak it a little bit
[8532.81s -> 8539.75s]  It's nothing like nothing bad. It's nothing not bad. Nothing like like
[8540.63s -> 8543.30s]  Like violent or off learn. No, nothing like that
[8544.26s -> 8552.12s]  Nothing like like sexual or no, no, no, no. No, it was just something that was not didn't sit completely. Well
[8552.88s -> 8568.39s]  Which I mean for very obvious reasons, right? But they're not obvious to us
[8570.72s -> 8573.32s]  But this is such an I love this idea
[8573.32s -> 8580.26s]  I can't I don't it's nothing bad and there's not like oh my god, you can't do this
[8580.26s -> 8585.28s]  No, it's just we had to be like kind of careful with it because we didn't want to make it seem like it was really happening
[8585.76s -> 8587.76s]  That's what it came down to
[8587.84s -> 8603.84s]  No, no leaks. You already know the baseball stream is coming up in like a couple months. So no no leaks
[8604.48s -> 8607.23s]  I've already leaked way too much of that stream
[8609.79s -> 8614.95s]  Like I was gonna be I'm good. I don't care how what people say about that stream is gonna be one of my favorites ever
[8614.95s -> 8621.40s]  I can't wait to do that stream. You have no idea. It's gonna I can't wait
[8621.76s -> 8625.60s]  Yes for me that that streams for me. Okay. No, it's for you, too
[8626.12s -> 8639.28s]  This is coming along
[8639.28s -> 8650.48s]  No for is no leaks. No person someone in chat said it. Yes
[8651.12s -> 8655.76s]  Someone in chat has talked about it because I I have talked about it before
[8656.40s -> 8662.69s]  Very briefly. I didn't get on going to details of what it meant, but I don't know it was gonna be fine
[8664.37s -> 8676.88s]  But I didn't do that stream not because I didn't have like permission to it was just that
[8678.44s -> 8682.20s]  Other stuff really became way more important to take care of and do
[8683.56s -> 8688.76s]  And it became one of those streams that just fell through the cracks maybe temporarily until some of the other stuff get done
[8689.32s -> 8695.78s]  No, it wasn't a car accident thing
[8698.73s -> 8700.73s]  fortnight vape stream I
[8703.96s -> 8708.16s]  Will do that stream one day before I retire for real
[8708.16s -> 8713.28s]  I'm gonna do the vape guy playing fortnight joke. I'm gonna I
[8713.84s -> 8718.00s]  Don't know when I don't know how but I'm gonna do that stream
[8723.20s -> 8725.20s]  the daycare stream
[8725.48s -> 8736.28s]  Okay, I'll talk okay, I'm gonna talk about it because it's stupid
[8738.65s -> 8743.29s]  Community Jake told me also that this is probably a bad idea. Let's not do it and I was like, okay fine
[8744.01s -> 8748.91s]  there was a stream idea a while back where I
[8749.63s -> 8755.04s]  Announced to the stream that I was operating at daycare and that guys, you know
[8755.04s -> 8758.52s]  I'm just trying to make some extra money on the side here. I'm operating a daycare and
[8759.28s -> 8762.20s]  I'm gonna be operating it in we got some of these children here
[8762.24s -> 8764.24s]  I'm gonna be taking care of them and
[8764.24s -> 8766.24s]  it was gonna be like
[8766.48s -> 8775.29s]  like a half dozen like babies in like baby things back here and I was gonna periodically get them gonna be those babies that like
[8775.77s -> 8779.89s]  Made the sounds and stuff and like I had to go feed them and it was gonna be like a look
[8779.89s -> 8781.49s]  I'm feeding the babies thing
[8781.49s -> 8784.61s]  Where it went off the rails is some crazy stuff was gonna happen
[8784.77s -> 8791.49s]  We're like a bear was gonna fucking attack my office and I was gonna have to like defend the babies from a bear and shit
[8791.53s -> 8795.17s]  And like crazy stuff was gonna happen. I was gonna have to like fight for them and fight again
[8795.17s -> 8798.49s]  There's gonna be they were gonna like be able to vote for what I was gonna play next on stream
[8798.53s -> 8803.19s]  I'm not real babies like bait like dolls
[8803.35s -> 8804.67s]  What are you talking about?
[8804.67s -> 8822.60s]  like small infant baby dolls that just sit back here and I'm like running a daycare and I have to like defend them from like a
[8823.52s -> 8829.28s]  Bear is coming in and I fight the bear and like and maybe one of the babies like gets up and like attacks the bear and shit
[8829.80s -> 8832.93s]  That sounds awesome though
[8833.13s -> 8844.19s]  But it got to a point where I was like, you know what this probably isn't this probably isn't a great idea and
[8844.85s -> 8846.17s]  Community Jake is just like yeah
[8846.17s -> 8850.25s]  Let's like leave this one on the cutting room floor because like I don't think that this is gonna work and I'm like, yeah
[8850.25s -> 8852.25s]  You know what? This probably is gonna be hard to make work
[8852.77s -> 8866.69s]  Who would possibly worry about it being real? Well, not that it was real, but I don't know
[8867.21s -> 8874.82s]  Especially if like the babies we're gonna be back here like making noises while I was sitting here like talking and like streaming
[8874.82s -> 8878.04s]  I mean, look, let me be honest
[8878.08s -> 8883.08s]  Is that as bad as me wanting to do another one that got shut down another one that got shut down
[8883.64s -> 8889.44s]  Is I wanted to second cat boy stream and I wanted to shit in the litter box that was in the corner of the room
[8889.80s -> 8892.12s]  Is that is that the same? Is that just as bad?
[8892.92s -> 8899.20s]  That one got shut down too
[8916.19s -> 8918.19s]  You guys don't know
[8918.19s -> 8922.04s]  There's a lot of ideas that pass through like a small treatment
[8922.44s -> 8929.93s]  That me and community Jake will sit to call for like an hour and we'll be like, yeah, I mean, okay
[8929.93s -> 8931.49s]  So the for the second cat boy stream
[8931.49s -> 8935.17s]  What if there was like just cat toys around the room and I'm like running around chasing them
[8935.37s -> 8938.37s]  Maybe like chat can pick on like what toy I play with
[8938.61s -> 8943.33s]  Like that will there be a big cat tree that I climb up and like sleep on and just sit there for like 10 straight minutes
[8943.33s -> 8946.96s]  Oh, and they'll be like a litter box, too
[8946.96s -> 8949.68s]  and like maybe I'll go over to the litter box and maybe I'll shit in the litter box and
[8950.24s -> 8954.74s]  It's just like whoa. Well, hold on a minute Jeremy back back up for a second. What do you want to do?
[8955.22s -> 8958.78s]  And I'm like, well, no, I'm just saying like I'm just trying to think of like things that like funny shit to do
[8959.30s -> 8966.98s]  But I wouldn't actually guys. I wouldn't have actually shit in a litter box on stream
[8967.30s -> 8970.54s]  it would be like I would just go be a cat in the litter box and
[8970.94s -> 8975.73s]  Like that would be and like that would be like you're like, oh, okay. We're gonna go to BRB
[8975.73s -> 8993.01s]  He's like using the litter box. I can't reach this you need to fire community Jake
[8993.57s -> 8996.00s]  No, I'm sorry
[8996.20s -> 9007.21s]  I'm trying to think of all this stuff that I kind of thought of would be like kind of funny for a second
[9007.21s -> 9013.56s]  Then I'm like, no, actually, maybe I don't think I wanted really want to do that one. What else stop cutting logs. Oh
[9014.84s -> 9016.60s]  Fuck I am you're right
[9016.60s -> 9025.21s]  Hey, what about the AS? Yeah, the ASMR stream too. That's another one. That's gone
[9025.53s -> 9031.44s]  That was the one where I wanted to have a marching band come in in the middle of the stream and like while I'm still talking
[9032.32s -> 9040.27s]  That was another one where I wanted to I wanted to like shit like shave
[9041.07s -> 9043.59s]  Do like a oh, it's you're at the barber getting shaved
[9044.47s -> 9051.96s]  Stop giving up on these good ideas
[9053.84s -> 9060.50s]  I mean, here's the doll look a lot of stuff hits the cutting room floor for various reasons
[9060.82s -> 9074.60s]  I'm gonna have full creative control in quotes lol guys
[9074.60s -> 9078.66s]  I think that backtracking on the I'm gonna shit in a litter box on stream joke
[9079.18s -> 9082.78s]  It's not what you are describing right there with what you just said. I
[9087.28s -> 9092.86s]  Think that is very reasonable that I would maybe be like maybe not maybe not that one
[9099.16s -> 9111.78s]  He's not he's brand friendly you came up with the idea I
[9114.12s -> 9121.36s]  Have a notebook that I I have a notebook that I just write shit in
[9121.88s -> 9144.32s]  It's I fill it with shit. This is way too tall. That's gonna be it, right? There we go
[9144.64s -> 9153.13s]  What do you say you say what?
[9153.81s -> 9160.74s]  Few years ago you talked on on the on criticals podcast about the courtroom thing. What was that?
[9161.42s -> 9163.10s]  All right, I can talk about that
[9163.14s -> 9169.78s]  I was gonna go on trial for killing Santa Claus and we were gonna have a courtroom and I was gonna be on trial for it
[9170.30s -> 9173.86s]  but it wasn't gonna be like a normal court is gonna be like kind of like a magical court and
[9174.82s -> 9180.50s]  Santa's lawyer was gonna be like sing his prosecution at the jury and shit and I was gonna get pissed off and
[9181.02s -> 9187.34s]  it's gonna be like a magical Christmas stream where I'm just this evil fucking awful person and
[9189.82s -> 9193.13s]  The problem there was a lot of stuff that was gonna happen on that stream
[9195.27s -> 9196.63s]  Unfortunately
[9196.63s -> 9199.12s]  kind of ran out of time because
[9199.64s -> 9206.04s]  That was also right in the period where I was gonna start to move. I was right before moving to Vegas and
[9206.84s -> 9209.12s]  the you killed Santa routine
[9209.76s -> 9215.72s]  Wasn't really relevant anymore. And like a year goes by two years go by and I think in the chat
[9215.72s -> 9221.76s]  I made jokes about oh, you know, the legal system sure does take a long time or something, but it never ended up happening
[9222.40s -> 9235.44s]  What's happening? What am I doing?
[9236.40s -> 9259.17s]  Did I pick up how many logs do I have? This is what I need, right? Oh shit
[9263.21s -> 9269.04s]  What do I have? Oh
[9269.96s -> 9276.42s]  Yeah stuff hits the cutting room floor
[9277.18s -> 9281.52s]  One of the other things I could probably think of what if it's another one that like I was like, yeah, probably not
[9281.96s -> 9288.82s]  There is one that I actually still want to do and it's not it's the one we originally brought up
[9293.75s -> 9299.61s]  The one that I that was originally brought up is not the one you haven't I haven't said it yet
[9300.09s -> 9306.96s]  Because I think that one actually might still happen it's possible
[9307.52s -> 9319.73s]  So I'm not gonna spoil that one. I'll spoil the ones that you are guaranteed to not happen like the German daycare stream
[9319.73s -> 9337.85s]  Oh, yeah, there's the chocolate factory stream where I was gonna go and pretend like I had a chocolate factory and do this whole
[9337.85s -> 9344.01s]  Willy Wonka routine where we had to eliminate people or something. I don't know what that I don't know what fucks wrong with me sometimes
[9344.81s -> 9363.96s]  Hey, looks good
[9363.96s -> 9373.20s]  More planks. Give me what about your book? Yeah, I know
[9373.76s -> 9377.96s]  I'm aware
[9377.96s -> 9398.52s]  Eliminate people like you get eliminated from like the like Willy Wonka need more these planks 30 webcam stream
[9398.52s -> 9419.97s]  That was another one. Yeah, who will replace me stuff should have been streamers. Well, the reason why I wanted it to be
[9421.13s -> 9423.57s]  actors and not like other streamers
[9424.09s -> 9425.61s]  it's because
[9425.61s -> 9429.22s]  It I don't know having to be other streamers almost feels
[9430.02s -> 9432.66s]  Like it's too
[9432.66s -> 9439.94s]  Having actors is almost more real to me because like I wouldn't have another streamer to take like they're they're already a streamer
[9440.34s -> 9449.51s]  Like if I go let's get a bunch of like streamers together to do this. It'd be like these are just streamers that you know
[9450.11s -> 9453.66s]  You don't know any of those actors. Maybe you did
[9454.36s -> 9470.20s]  What do you mean actors? I mean the actors that came in to try to take my role from me. So I mean
[9473.48s -> 9475.48s]  Thankfully they were actors. Yeah
[9475.88s -> 9484.71s]  What are you talking about I got a bunch of actors together
[9485.39s -> 9493.64s]  To see like who could do me the best it came down to if we didn't really need them
[9494.16s -> 9496.16s]  because I wasn't ready and
[9500.12s -> 9510.64s]  we had a little bullshit happen at the end of that stream and thankfully I was able to you know
[9511.00s -> 9515.42s]  Do what I needed to do and prove my case to whoever I needed to prove it to of course like dr
[9515.42s -> 9517.96s]  Schmolikson and Ludwig and those guys and they took care of that fucking weird guy
[9518.44s -> 9520.44s]  one of those weird actor
[9520.44s -> 9533.50s]  Yeah, they're like as I was a good actor
[9533.70s -> 9541.12s]  They got rid of the actor and I get to continue to do what I want to do and I'm not gone yet
[9541.12s -> 9562.24s]  I don't have to stop like I'm fine. Yeah, somebody was shot. What I mean, we figured it out. We got the right person
[9562.24s -> 9569.82s]  It's easy. You are the everybody already knows that you could see through it was clear as day
[9570.26s -> 9574.23s]  I'm trying to put forth like the illusion
[9574.79s -> 9581.06s]  You know of you know, obviously don't want people to think I'm like retiring
[9581.82s -> 9594.72s]  Not I'm just still going stir shot you on purpose
[9596.14s -> 9598.14s]  Nobody shot me. Okay, I
[9600.39s -> 9602.39s]  Did nobody shot me? I?
[9602.75s -> 9606.15s]  watched as somebody was being a little ridiculous and
[9606.67s -> 9626.64s]  Game was rigged from the start. You're not the real German then. Who am I then?
[9627.08s -> 9628.20s]  Huh?
[9628.20s -> 9632.58s]  I'm not the real German of a hot cup of cider hot cup of coffee
[9633.26s -> 9634.71s]  What?
[9634.71s -> 9636.80s]  hot cup of cider
[9636.80s -> 9643.45s]  How much more do I need to prove that I'm real?
[9644.09s -> 9654.72s]  This is long, huh?
[9654.72s -> 9656.00s]  Aaron
[9656.00s -> 9658.32s]  Aaron
[9658.32s -> 9660.76s]  Let me tell you something really important though
[9660.88s -> 9668.32s]  If that was to be a show where that would happen, right my favorite part of that show
[9669.81s -> 9675.66s]  100% besides obviously like the errand stuff is the fact that some you know
[9676.04s -> 9681.75s]  People were given material to potentially look at and see kind of you know
[9681.75s -> 9685.11s]  Who that person could be and what's that person like on camera?
[9685.67s -> 9691.48s]  They may have had a whole package made for them, right if that were if that were the case and the fact that
[9692.00s -> 9694.04s]  Oh
[9694.04s -> 9701.38s]  Got cider hot cup of coffee hot cup of cocoa is the thing like the aspect the AI
[9702.02s -> 9709.93s]  Was given one thing and then wrote a book about it, right? I that's my favorite part is oh, yeah hot cup of cider
[9710.39s -> 9712.63s]  That's what I do. That's me
[9713.59s -> 9716.21s]  I
[9716.25s -> 9718.82s]  Love it so much. Oh
[9718.82s -> 9724.14s]  So welcome. How are you? Oh, yeah hot cup of cocoa. Oh, yeah, that's me. That's what I do. That's my thing
[9724.14s -> 9726.70s]  That's all I do. Oh
[9727.02s -> 9732.39s]  So I loved it. Oh, can I get a look at me, please?
[9735.53s -> 9739.31s]  The best part is how everybody wanted to play Dark Souls and
[9742.09s -> 9748.64s]  Here okay, so here's some lore on that stream a lot of those guys didn't know anything about Dark Souls
[9748.68s -> 9754.45s]  They didn't even know what it was. So watching them struggle with like the mouse and like trying to
[9754.81s -> 9762.97s]  Swing and like take one after one by one by one. They would come in. Oh, I'm gonna play in Dark Souls like oh
[9763.45s -> 9766.02s]  Okay, I don't think you want to do that
[9766.66s -> 9781.32s]  Getting into like the tutorial room and then Octo pimp comes in and just like beats it first try that was so goddamn funny
[9781.60s -> 9787.91s]  No, I loved that. That was so much fun again
[9787.91s -> 9790.93s]  If you if you don't know we're talking about or if you do
[9791.13s -> 9795.04s]  All those audio problems and all like the stream lagging problems
[9795.81s -> 9800.77s]  We have like twitch server issues as well as like kind of issues with our connection like at the venue
[9800.85s -> 9805.97s]  so a lot of those random audio issues that would like
[9808.17s -> 9811.52s]  Most of those are gone in the VOD that's on the archive channel
[9811.52s -> 9820.54s]  So it still pops up a little bit but not even remotely close as much as it did before
[9820.82s -> 9831.60s]  Okay, I gotta stop like walking up and down the ladder and actually do this. I need them to be thin like that
[9831.72s -> 9850.80s]  Okay, we just need to cut down a bunch of trees got it. They gotta be long. Okay speedrun
[9865.04s -> 9871.03s]  Is there any behind-the-scenes stuff from that show? Oh, there might be I think there's a few things
[9871.03s -> 9876.41s]  Yeah, I know that um, I know Holly had some behind-the-scenes stuff
[9876.41s -> 9880.95s]  I think there's a few videos some pictures and stuff that she had maybe we'll see
[9881.31s -> 9886.81s]  You know what? I also have which I just realized the other day I have
[9887.41s -> 9895.28s]  You know, I don't want you to do that stuff. I have a bunch of cut
[9895.68s -> 9902.56s]  Bugleberry hot tub for hot tub footage of stuff that was not in there. It's not on that stream
[9903.08s -> 9911.96s]  Maybe I'll like cut that up and just show it
[9912.52s -> 9932.27s]  Here release the bugleberry footage. No, stop doing this. There's so many of these planks now
[9932.79s -> 9954.58s]  The Elbertson cut how many do I need? One, two, three, four five like one more
[9954.58s -> 9972.90s]  I don't do it and then I think this is pretty close. I just put on the top layer
[9973.42s -> 9977.93s]  These are these planks. Okay. I actually have a lot of planks already
[9985.44s -> 9999.52s]  Good thing. I had these cut. This is a chill game. Even though it's very very simple. It's I don't know. It's cool. I like it
[10000.04s -> 10016.56s]  This is what actually a house looks like. How come it's so engaging. I just is it's just I don't know something about it
[10016.56s -> 10020.67s]  Just like it's really nice. I love playing games like these on stream
[10021.07s -> 10022.99s]  It'll it allows
[10022.99s -> 10025.31s]  It allows for some just we can just talk about whatever
[10025.83s -> 10033.08s]  It's fun. We can just it just can just sit in the background while we just talk. It's fun
[10038.36s -> 10045.72s]  Over here. Oh, I need one more. There we go
[10047.56s -> 10054.55s]  It's time for the roof. These are planks as well. Oh shit. It's a lot of planks. All right
[10055.21s -> 10057.05s]  Start the process
[10057.05s -> 10077.28s]  Got it. My favorite was the one that did the Yoda impression
[10078.46s -> 10084.66s]  Yeah, he's great. They were all great though. They were they were all so cool about everything. They're all so fun
[10088.36s -> 10090.40s]  They're incredibly talented, too
[10090.96s -> 10101.21s]  It just it's so it's cool to because a lot of those guys were just gonna we just had a casting company help us find all
[10101.21s -> 10103.41s]  those actors and
[10103.41s -> 10105.51s]  It's crazy to see just how
[10106.25s -> 10108.29s]  People have so many interesting things that they can do
[10109.13s -> 10111.57s]  Talents things that they think are funny things that they can do. I
[10112.17s -> 10116.71s]  Love that shit. I think it's it's really cool. I love doing that
[10117.19s -> 10122.88s]  So another reason why like okay like for a lot of these things could I just have like a few streamers do it
[10122.88s -> 10126.32s]  I mean, yeah, but I think it's more fun to like see
[10126.96s -> 10132.70s]  Like other what other people are doing and have some like kind of actors that you don't really know people that you don't see on
[10132.70s -> 10134.34s]  stream be able to show
[10134.38s -> 10141.80s]  I'm doing stuff. I that's a huge reason why like I mean obviously dr. Spokes and
[10144.99s -> 10149.15s]  dr. Smokin is awesome, and he's
[10150.49s -> 10152.69s]  incredibly nice wonderful person and
[10154.68s -> 10157.65s]  years ago just kind of like just
[10159.02s -> 10168.25s]  Roped him into the channel and he's just been kind of here ever since it was awesome
[10168.25s -> 10171.56s]  When I knew that I was gonna do that show it's like, okay any judges
[10172.00s -> 10178.22s]  What do I want to judge that and then the very obvious choices are like okay who like streamer friends and
[10179.50s -> 10185.81s]  Like obviously like stir right stir obviously has been around for a very long time if somebody knows in quotes, Jerma
[10185.97s -> 10193.92s]  It's gonna be stir. It's be people like stir italics and like Ludwig Ludwig is like kind of
[10194.94s -> 10198.66s]  Like at the last few years. I kind of really started to talk to him and get to know him a little better
[10199.46s -> 10201.46s]  so it's kind of like old
[10201.62s -> 10209.02s]  German 985 new German 985 and then like dr. Schmeichsen it was it was just fun. It was really cool
[10209.02s -> 10212.37s]  I loved it. I told you that that was gonna be one of my favorite streams
[10212.41s -> 10218.04s]  And it was I had so much fun doing that show that I'm like sad
[10218.04s -> 10232.85s]  It's gone, and I want to do it like I want to do it again. Who is dr. Schmeichsen? I mean
[10233.37s -> 10235.37s]  It's dr. Schmeichsen, you know
[10235.85s -> 10248.59s]  Doc the doctor, but that's a whole we talked about evolved earlier in the stream and how I'm signed with evolved
[10248.97s -> 10255.82s]  It's to be able to do more stuff like that and have shows paid for have brands be able to come in and help
[10255.82s -> 10256.84s]  I
[10256.84s -> 10263.55s]  Want to do that stuff that stuff means more to me than anything else. I think you guys are you guys know that?
[10263.55s -> 10274.45s]  I don't think I have to explain that I love what I'm doing right now because this is its own different kind of beast
[10274.93s -> 10280.23s]  Right sitting here streaming a game chillin talking just made fucking around making jokes, whatever
[10280.99s -> 10290.21s]  But like I will always remember all those shows and you're probably noticing behind me on the reddit shelf I put
[10290.61s -> 10292.61s]  once the show is done I
[10292.65s -> 10299.30s]  Put it up there. I put like a little token on the shelf just enough not enough for any reason just cuz like oh
[10299.30s -> 10303.54s]  Yeah, I like it. It's like it's a fun kind of memory of like remembering that. Oh, yeah, I remember doing that
[10303.54s -> 10311.19s]  That was cool. What about the dagger? I mean that was not supposed to be on there. It was just there temporarily
[10312.03s -> 10316.24s]  So I know people probably like why is there like a fucking dagger?
[10316.36s -> 10329.04s]  What is what is the dagger for and I mean maybe it is like a little cheesy is like a little corny whatever
[10329.20s -> 10334.16s]  Well, I don't it's not it's nice to walk in the room and be like oh, yeah, that was fun
[10334.56s -> 10347.73s]  Let us see it. Sure. I mean there's a there's a new addition
[10347.77s -> 10361.23s]  There's a couple of there that I think I would want to put something up there for but I haven't as you see
[10361.51s -> 10364.85s]  You notice something up there
[10364.85s -> 10372.77s]  Yeah, like you got and it's like but streams that I think really had a great time with if you notice on that
[10372.77s -> 10376.89s]  I don't think I've really talked about this. It's kind of interesting because I don't think I've ever said this
[10377.29s -> 10385.29s]  Look at the games that are up there too. All right, the thing is on there. The movies is on there. See man is up there
[10385.45s -> 10392.44s]  Yeah, the the the Funko pops are kind of being pushed out
[10392.48s -> 10395.35s]  Oh, yeah, it's that most of that stuff is like
[10395.35s -> 10397.19s]  Oh, this is stuff that I stream that I thought was cool
[10397.19s -> 10407.20s]  I thought was fun one of the rocks from archaeology, of course Pac-Man the Wii I think what's down there?
[10407.20s -> 10422.98s]  I'm gonna remember where's the fedora up there. I think there's a couple other things I should put up there from the New Year's stream
[10422.98s -> 10430.38s]  Oh, yeah, the goats from the carnival. The book in the potion is from the hot tub
[10430.66s -> 10433.94s]  Hats from the last one the replacement stream
[10434.96s -> 10438.52s]  985 is dollhouse obviously grotto beast is right next to it. See man is right there
[10438.76s -> 10446.57s]  The archaeology thing is right there the big geode I'm surprised nobody's noticed this one
[10446.73s -> 10449.99s]  You see what's all the way in the left on the one two three on the third shelf
[10450.13s -> 10457.60s]  You guys see what that is. It's a rat
[10458.04s -> 10473.06s]  It's a rat with a Christmas hat on and the Bluetooth is a Bluetooth brush sitting on them. Yeah, I mean it's a little
[10473.06s -> 10478.40s]  Is it a little corny? Maybe it's a little corny. Well, I don't know
[10478.44s -> 10484.22s]  You know, it's gonna be sad if like I kind of taking that down, right? Oh
[10488.95s -> 10490.15s]  Oh
[10490.15s -> 10495.40s]  Time to get existential at times to get time to get real again. Oh, I mean a lot of you guys know
[10495.88s -> 10501.89s]  that I mean, I'm not gonna do this forever and how I
[10502.59s -> 10510.16s]  Decide on when and how that I'm gonna do something else from here. I don't know what that looks like yet, but
[10511.80s -> 10513.08s]  eventually
[10513.08s -> 10518.34s]  Eventually, I need to start to figure that out and I'm starting to piece together
[10518.86s -> 10541.56s]  What I would want to do after this let's let him on the roof. Okay on the other way
[10541.72s -> 10550.06s]  All right, whatever. I just need planks. Yeah, like what what do I want to do?
[10550.20s -> 10552.36s]  What do I do? I want what do I want to continue to do?
[10552.36s -> 10557.44s]  I have a few ideas things that I'd like to do where I wouldn't just like disappear completely, right?
[10557.44s -> 10566.20s]  I don't know. I don't know what that looks like yet, but I've I made the reference and I made the kind of I
[10567.65s -> 10574.77s]  Teased this in a way when I talked about like how I've been like my 10-year anniversary, which was last year, you know
[10574.77s -> 10576.77s]  It's like I don't know how much longer
[10577.21s -> 10581.61s]  I'm going to do this, but I'm just gonna keep doing it until I'm done whenever that is
[10582.25s -> 10605.29s]  Should run for president. No, I don't want to do that, but it's it's tricky because
[10606.17s -> 10612.54s]  You spend so much time doing something right and it's something that you care about cuz think I there hasn't been
[10613.26s -> 10620.46s]  Talk about like channel changes and trying to keep myself interested and keep myself going and I
[10620.82s -> 10625.10s]  Want to like want to fucking be here in the chair and not like feel like I have to be here in the chair
[10625.10s -> 10631.73s]  right, I think that kind of just goes to the reason why like the whole sponsorship stuff and
[10632.25s -> 10634.62s]  trying to make things easier from on myself and
[10635.14s -> 10641.38s]  There's been a long time to join the circus. Oh
[10642.46s -> 10653.90s]  These are too long. No, they're too short. Come on. Well now I fucked this whole thing up. Come here
[10654.06s -> 10670.42s]  You're gonna make me cry. No, that's not the whole that's not the intention. This house looks good. This guy can't stop talking about retiring
[10671.98s -> 10676.84s]  It's all he talks about
[10677.00s -> 10684.08s]  Well, I know you maybe we talked about the reddit shelf and all like the things that are on it and then
[10684.48s -> 10691.04s]  Thinking about like the future and then I put some more shows up there and then but but I I'm going anywhere
[10691.40s -> 10703.76s]  Like a door. Oh, but realistically speaking
[10704.93s -> 10712.44s]  TM I have to start to think about that stuff. I'm not 25 anymore
[10712.68s -> 10714.15s]  All right
[10714.15s -> 10724.19s]  I gotta start to think about what it means in the future and if I say the word retirement one more time
[10724.23s -> 10728.82s]  I will gift
[10728.86s -> 10740.63s]  Community steps. Oh, it's still really fun for me. I'm still having a great time
[10740.71s -> 10743.43s]  It's still very much something I enjoy doing all the time
[10743.43s -> 10751.46s]  As long as I can continue to keep myself interested and enjoy what I'm doing have a lot of fun and be able to create those
[10751.54s -> 10757.88s]  Moments and memories for me and for you too. I want everyone to enjoy this channel in this space, right?
[10757.88s -> 10781.86s]  I'm gonna I'm still here. You've said all those things like 50 times by now make it 51. Nice
[10786.39s -> 10790.67s]  Signs with evolved and does that immediately now?
[10790.67s -> 10795.67s]  I'm just saying this is a chill house stream. We talked about this stuff on the house streams
[10795.67s -> 10828.01s]  I think this is done is more how much more is there what? Oh, here we go. We're just talking
[10828.01s -> 10840.36s]  We're just talking you can go back to reviewing packages now. Okay. Oh
[10841.75s -> 10845.42s]  Right. So what do you guys want to see? So I do soups
[10846.10s -> 10847.99s]  auto treats
[10847.99s -> 10850.51s]  frozen dinners
