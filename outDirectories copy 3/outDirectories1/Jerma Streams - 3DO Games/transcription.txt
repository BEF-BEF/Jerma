[0.57s -> 5.74s]  Somebody in chat owes somebody $20. I gotta be right off the bat, gotta tell you right immediately.
[5.74s -> 13.54s]  Somebody in chat bet somebody in chat, I think, somebody else, that I wasn't gonna be able to capture this.
[13.54s -> 19.45s]  And they thought this was gonna be a disaster stream where I could not cap the 3DO.
[19.45s -> 26.36s]  Well, I am sad to say to that person, we're ready to go. It's good, it looks great.
[26.36s -> 29.16s]  It is working flawlessly, actually.
[34.95s -> 39.15s]  But today we're gonna do a 3DO. Welcome everybody, I'm excited for this. I've been waiting to do this for a long time.
[39.15s -> 50.06s]  I've owned this for almost a year. I've been collecting 3DO games in anticipation for this very moment today.
[50.06s -> 63.46s]  Do we need proof? I mean, okay, I can give you proof. I mean, I got a 3DO, crying out loud.
[63.46s -> 69.65s]  This is not on an emulator, this is actually... I'm gonna give a shout out here when there's a shitload of people here
[69.65s -> 76.05s]  because I wanna shout this company out because this thing works, it works very well, and I wanna shout out that company.
[85.84s -> 96.56s]  I've used a kind of old console converting upscaling hardware before, and this one is the best that I have personally used.
[96.56s -> 106.10s]  Wouldn't you like to know what it is? You'll find out once there's more than a thousand people here.
[106.10s -> 112.24s]  So I can show that I said to more than a thousand people that most amount of people were here.
[112.24s -> 128.27s]  And I said it. No, it's a Retro Tink. The Retro Tink 2X Pro. The thing is amazing.
[128.91s -> 133.71s]  It was the easiest thing I've ever used in my life. I just plugged everything I needed to plug in in.
[133.71s -> 140.29s]  I downloaded some updated firmware, flashed it, and it's ready to use. And it looks way better than anything else I've ever used.
[140.29s -> 149.95s]  It's a Retro Tink. If you wanna use original hardware and you have an HDTV, get a Retro Tink 2X Pro.
[149.95s -> 160.67s]  And tell them Germa95 sent you. Who cares? No, it's actually really great. And you're gonna see what the picture looks like right now.
[160.67s -> 180.02s]  Hey, look at that. Take a look at that. 3DO on original hardware. Somebody resident sleepered.
[180.02s -> 188.29s]  Whatever. This is big to me. This is a big deal for me. You haven't even shown it yet. Well, hold on. Let's restart this.
[188.29s -> 203.33s]  You haven't shown it yet. Look. Ow. Germa heart. Germa heart. It looks great. I know. It looks awesome.
[203.33s -> 218.58s]  Show us the console. Alright, hold on. Let me show you the console. I don't... whatever.
[218.58s -> 239.06s]  I had a fucking tank. I had a tube top on. Alright? I had a tube top on that went like this.
[239.06s -> 252.51s]  When you have to delay your audio and video on OBS, what happens is, it doesn't matter if fucking hours have passed.
[252.51s -> 259.62s]  A whole day could pass. If you didn't close OBS, it saves the last frame that you did.
[259.62s -> 264.19s]  And when you're setting shit up, sometimes you just don't even think about it. I'm just happy that you didn't see my dick.
[264.19s -> 267.39s]  Like that's... I'm just telling you a fact. I'm just happy that that's not what happened.
[267.39s -> 278.42s]  Oh, yeah. That's fine. Look. I know. I'm fine. Alright. Anyways. What am I doing? I'm showing you... okay.
[278.42s -> 293.79s]  So watch. I'll show you for an example. An hour can go by and that's going to save there because I delayed the video.
[293.79s -> 302.51s]  Was he wearing pants? Yes, I was. I remember wearing pants. Don't worry.
[302.51s -> 309.34s]  Okay. You know that photo of me playing TF2 with just like a bare chest? That just happened.
[309.34s -> 317.15s]  I don't care. I don't even care. Okay. I don't even care. Even if I was naked, I wouldn't even care.
[317.15s -> 321.12s]  Even if I was naked, I wouldn't even care. I would just be like, whatever. I don't even care.
[321.12s -> 338.37s]  Okay. Let's show this thing. Here's the whole setup. So what we have here, here is the...
[338.37s -> 345.09s]  Here is the... Well, that's a controller. There's the controller. The Panasonic 3DO controller.
[345.09s -> 350.11s]  What is that guy plugged into? There it is. The 3DO.
[350.11s -> 366.26s]  The Panasonic FZ10 3DO. Connected to Game Retro Tank 2X Pro. Connected to my capture card.
[366.26s -> 377.44s]  Break it. I'm not going to break this thing. This thing's awesome. Why would I break it?
[377.44s -> 382.24s]  That was pre-recorded footage. Or even if that... Okay. Even if that was pre-recorded footage, who cares?
[382.24s -> 386.30s]  I own the console and it's plugged in. Does it really matter?
[386.30s -> 392.53s]  Do you think I went through all the trouble to plug in all this stuff and like set it all up just to take a video of it?
[392.53s -> 396.37s]  I mean, that's next level. I see where you're going. All right. Let's go.
[396.37s -> 404.11s]  One more stalling. Time for 3DO. Let's restart the program. I'm so excited.
[404.11s -> 408.42s]  Ladies and gentlemen, Rebel Assault Star Wars for the 3DO.
[408.42s -> 416.13s]  I am not seeing even nearly enough fucking hype right now. Hype it up, guys. Come on.
[416.13s -> 425.44s]  Actually, don't. I'd rather you be disappointed. Up pilots.
[425.44s -> 437.60s]  No, I want to get the... How do I get the... I want to get the intro. Just restart the system.
[437.60s -> 440.40s]  All right. Hold on. I'm going to restart the system. I'm going to restart the system.
[440.40s -> 448.03s]  I hope I don't break it. Don't break it. Okay. Ready?
[448.03s -> 456.50s]  Zach, is it going to break the hardware?
[456.50s -> 467.33s]  All right. Here we go. You ready? Nobody wanted to see the intro anyways.
[467.33s -> 477.33s]  That's the intro. It's pretty bad. It's loading. It's loading. It's loading. I can't wait. Here we go.
[477.33s -> 482.77s]  I'm so excited. I'm so excited for 3CVDO.
[482.77s -> 495.58s]  Did I even have to do that? I didn't even have to do that. I didn't... I really actually didn't even need to turn it off.
[495.58s -> 512.52s]  Will you... All right. Here we go. Quiet. Yes.
[512.52s -> 522.85s]  It is a period of civil war. Full spaceships striking from a hidden base have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
[522.85s -> 529.02s]  Who, under the command of Darth Vader, rule the galaxy with an iron fist.
[529.02s -> 535.02s]  That video is so good. 144p video file.
[535.02s -> 545.59s]  It's Luke. I know Luke. Many young unknown pilots have joined the Rebels in the hope they can restore freedom to the galaxy.
[545.59s -> 553.56s]  Either way, this whole thing was made in MS Paint. It probably was, if I'll be honest. It probably was.
[553.56s -> 572.25s]  3D movie maker, actually. We can talk all the shit that we want.
[572.25s -> 580.25s]  It actually looks pretty good, considering that it is an upscaled image of like 140 or like 240p or something.
[580.25s -> 587.03s]  It looks pretty damn good. It'll look a lot worse. Let's go.
[587.03s -> 594.20s]  All right. I'm done stalling. Let's play.
[594.20s -> 603.74s]  Smells pretty good.
[603.74s -> 605.74s]  We're a pile of crap.
[605.74s -> 612.63s]  Can I sneeze?
[612.63s -> 623.49s]  Attack com control. Request attack com control. Clearance granted. Is that you, kid?
[623.49s -> 624.49s]  Yeah.
[624.49s -> 625.49s]  Jack! Good to hear you.
[625.49s -> 628.49s]  So you're running your trials today. I wish I could be with you.
[628.49s -> 631.49s]  You shouldn't have any problems. Beggar's Canyon isn't half as tough as the rest we used to do.
[631.49s -> 632.49s]  So unsettling. I love it, though.
[632.49s -> 634.49s]  Good luck. Thanks.
[634.49s -> 639.84s]  All right. So in Rebels... I don't play this.
[639.84s -> 644.10s]  It's T-Rex. Oh, no. We're flying out of this canyon. Never mind.
[644.10s -> 647.69s]  I thought it was a T-Rex.
[654.27s -> 659.90s]  Should I steer clear that you have to fly?
[659.90s -> 662.21s]  All right. I'm actually flying.
[662.21s -> 664.90s]  Wow. This is awesome.
[664.90s -> 669.71s]  This definitely wasn't the trailer for the 3DO. There's no way it wasn't.
[669.71s -> 675.79s]  All right. It's a little tight. It's kind of hard to tell.
[675.79s -> 679.06s]  Working the canyon.
[679.06s -> 684.11s]  Let's go right.
[684.11s -> 686.11s]  I'm a true hotshot, man.
[686.11s -> 697.59s]  I am.
[697.59s -> 702.39s]  Why would you bring the trainee here?
[702.39s -> 711.01s]  This doesn't seem very safe.
[711.01s -> 713.01s]  Okay, trainee.
[713.01s -> 716.50s]  You don't know how to fly planes yet, but just do this hard shit.
[716.50s -> 717.50s]  I'm doing it.
[717.50s -> 726.06s]  That guy was trying to kill me.
[726.06s -> 727.06s]  This guy wants me dead.
[727.06s -> 741.06s]  All right. So far so good.
[741.06s -> 752.80s]  I...
[752.80s -> 761.63s]  Oh, it's too tight.
[761.63s -> 767.48s]  Good. Did it fly up with him?
[767.48s -> 773.28s]  I'm so excited. I can't wait to play.
[773.28s -> 777.28s]  There's 40 games. I have 40 3DO games. I'm so excited.
[777.28s -> 785.54s]  Shoot at the targets?
[785.54s -> 797.00s]  Wait, what?
[797.00s -> 798.00s]  I got him.
[798.00s -> 799.75s]  Wait, was that my friend?
[799.75s -> 803.38s]  Wait, did I shoot one of the good guys?
[803.38s -> 810.52s]  Oh, my God. Did I get to do the whole thing?
[810.52s -> 811.52s]  Okay.
[811.52s -> 815.14s]  I'm going to go left this time because I want it to be really easy.
[815.14s -> 825.45s]  That was friendly fire.
[825.45s -> 826.45s]  I'm going left.
[826.45s -> 831.12s]  Forget about going right. No.
[831.12s -> 834.12s]  No, I don't want to be a hotshot. I just want to be a regular guy.
[834.12s -> 836.12s]  I went left.
[836.12s -> 840.42s]  My ship was tilting left. It's forcing me to go right.
[840.42s -> 853.46s]  It's okay. I got plenty of health.
[853.46s -> 856.15s]  Okay. Now this time, it's like a top-down view.
[856.15s -> 858.15s]  All right. Don't screw this up.
[858.15s -> 863.98s]  Is it actually a loser of choice?
[863.98s -> 867.35s]  It might be.
[867.35s -> 890.76s]  Stay with us.
[890.76s -> 893.76s]  What the fuck happened?
[893.76s -> 897.66s]  No, dude. That's not even what?
[897.66s -> 900.03s]  Stay tight. Follow and stay clear of the walls.
[900.03s -> 902.03s]  No, I don't want to.
[902.03s -> 908.92s]  It's very weird. I don't understand.
[908.92s -> 913.49s]  When do I get the lightsaber?
[913.49s -> 915.49s]  Do you get a lightsaber in this game?
[915.49s -> 916.49s]  You get a lightsaber, right?
[916.49s -> 917.49s]  You have to.
[917.49s -> 918.73s]  It's a Star Wars game.
[918.73s -> 920.73s]  I have to beat this.
[920.73s -> 926.90s]  Left.
[926.90s -> 930.76s]  Yeah.
[930.76s -> 931.76s]  Yeah.
[931.76s -> 933.76s]  I want as much health as possible.
[933.76s -> 940.67s]  I have to beat this.
[940.67s -> 944.70s]  This is harder than the other one.
[944.70s -> 948.93s]  Okay. Don't mess this up.
[948.93s -> 950.93s]  Shoot the drones.
[950.93s -> 954.77s]  Okay. I tried.
[954.77s -> 956.77s]  All right. I'm going to fucking sit up.
[956.77s -> 964.64s]  Watch the pillars.
[964.64s -> 967.84s]  Pillars.
[967.84s -> 972.05s]  Pillars.
[972.05s -> 973.05s]  Pillars.
[973.05s -> 975.05s]  Oh, shit.
[975.05s -> 976.29s]  Okay.
[976.29s -> 987.70s]  All right.
[987.70s -> 991.76s]  What's that? Is it?
[991.76s -> 996.34s]  What's a bug's fight?
[996.34s -> 998.90s]  Fuck. I ran into it.
[998.90s -> 1002.36s]  Shit. I just crashed into it again.
[1002.36s -> 1004.98s]  Okay. It's hard to see.
[1004.98s -> 1005.98s]  Fuck.
[1005.98s -> 1010.91s]  Okay. Just stay away from the shadows.
[1010.91s -> 1020.79s]  Oh, fuck.
[1020.79s -> 1022.79s]  All right. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
[1022.79s -> 1030.38s]  No way.
[1030.38s -> 1032.38s]  All right. I can't lose my mind.
[1032.38s -> 1034.38s]  I cannot lose.
[1034.38s -> 1037.65s]  I'm just dead.
[1037.65s -> 1043.02s]  They're leaving me for dead.
[1043.02s -> 1046.89s]  Oh, I got game over.
[1046.89s -> 1048.89s]  All right. I'm going.
[1048.89s -> 1050.89s]  No. It's not even worth putting my name in.
[1050.89s -> 1052.83s]  That was just a warm up.
[1052.83s -> 1053.83s]  That was a warm up.
[1053.83s -> 1054.83s]  That was a warm up. Ready? I'm ready.
[1054.83s -> 1057.65s]  That was a warm up.
[1057.65s -> 1058.65s]  All right.
[1058.65s -> 1060.65s]  Somebody just go get the password for after this level if I can't do it.
[1060.65s -> 1064.17s]  That was a warm up.
[1064.17s -> 1066.56s]  What is this?
[1066.56s -> 1070.89s]  Rookie one is dialogue and text.
[1070.89s -> 1072.89s]  Volume difficulty is normal.
[1072.89s -> 1074.77s]  It's kind of cool.
[1074.77s -> 1081.00s]  Everything's right here.
[1081.00s -> 1084.62s]  All right. Let's go.
[1084.62s -> 1101.44s]  Oh, this is so fun though.
[1101.44s -> 1104.44s]  It's just I love it.
[1104.44s -> 1107.44s]  I don't care if I lose here a thousand times.
[1107.44s -> 1110.77s]  I'm holding a 3DO controller in my hand.
[1110.77s -> 1114.16s]  That's all I care about.
[1114.16s -> 1125.06s]  The song doesn't match.
[1125.06s -> 1127.70s]  I'm crashing the bridge.
[1127.70s -> 1130.46s]  Okay. Don't mess it up.
[1130.46s -> 1133.46s]  Just avoid the pillars and don't even who cares about shooting the drones.
[1133.46s -> 1139.47s]  All right. Go.
[1139.47s -> 1149.98s]  Who gives a shit about the Google Earth image that's underneath you?
[1149.98s -> 1158.90s]  Is that a shadow?
[1158.90s -> 1177.08s]  Watch out. Watch out.
[1177.08s -> 1183.25s]  Is this a wall?
[1183.25s -> 1189.67s]  Who cares?
[1189.67s -> 1190.67s]  Just let them go.
[1190.67s -> 1192.67s]  I've got no damage done to me.
[1192.67s -> 1196.73s]  It doesn't matter.
[1196.73s -> 1197.73s]  None of this matters.
[1197.73s -> 1198.73s]  Just live.
[1198.73s -> 1201.95s]  Where are they?
[1201.95s -> 1207.42s]  I did it.
[1207.42s -> 1215.31s]  I got a password.
[1215.31s -> 1218.19s]  Part one, path taken easy.
[1218.19s -> 1223.48s]  Password, boffin.
[1223.48s -> 1224.91s]  Yes.
[1224.91s -> 1225.91s]  Let's go.
[1225.91s -> 1226.91s]  Keep going.
[1226.91s -> 1229.92s]  After two, asteroid field training.
[1229.92s -> 1230.92s]  Okay, one.
[1230.92s -> 1234.14s]  This is commit.
[1234.14s -> 1237.24s]  One standing by, commander.
[1237.24s -> 1238.24s]  Let's get something straight.
[1238.24s -> 1239.24s]  I don't like hot shots.
[1239.24s -> 1244.40s]  If you want to impress me, you won't stand a chance.
[1244.40s -> 1246.40s]  I'm not like my twin brother.
[1246.40s -> 1248.40s]  Dave, I don't like hot shots.
[1248.40s -> 1249.40s]  He likes them.
[1249.40s -> 1251.40s]  Don't try to prove anything to me.
[1251.40s -> 1266.17s]  Sick.
[1266.17s -> 1268.62s]  What happened?
[1268.62s -> 1277.61s]  Why?
[1277.61s -> 1279.61s]  You guys moving number bunchers?
[1279.61s -> 1280.61s]  What was it?
[1280.61s -> 1281.61s]  Math blasters?
[1281.61s -> 1296.10s]  Watch.
[1296.10s -> 1297.66s]  Watch.
[1297.66s -> 1299.28s]  Fine.
[1299.28s -> 1304.42s]  Shit.
[1304.42s -> 1305.42s]  There's a lot of them coming.
[1305.42s -> 1306.42s]  Down?
[1306.42s -> 1310.29s]  All right.
[1310.29s -> 1311.29s]  We're good.
[1311.29s -> 1312.29s]  We're good.
[1312.29s -> 1313.29s]  We're good.
[1313.29s -> 1323.10s]  We're fine.
[1323.10s -> 1324.34s]  We're fine.
[1324.34s -> 1325.34s]  Perfect.
[1325.34s -> 1326.34s]  Thanks, man.
[1326.34s -> 1330.98s]  Omega low.
[1330.98s -> 1331.98s]  Omega low.
[1331.98s -> 1332.98s]  Erglick.
[1332.98s -> 1334.54s]  Erglick.
[1334.54s -> 1338.66s]  Yeah.
[1338.66s -> 1339.66s]  I know.
[1339.66s -> 1341.66s]  I know.
[1341.66s -> 1342.66s]  I know.
[1342.66s -> 1343.66s]  Okay.
[1343.66s -> 1344.66s]  Cool.
[1344.66s -> 1345.66s]  Good link.
[1345.66s -> 1357.46s]  I'm busy.
[1357.46s -> 1359.46s]  I was expecting her head to spin around 360 degrees.
[1359.46s -> 1360.46s]  Hard course.
[1360.46s -> 1373.22s]  Holy shit.
[1373.22s -> 1374.22s]  This is hard.
[1374.22s -> 1375.22s]  I'm sorry.
[1378.19s -> 1379.19s]  Okay.
[1379.19s -> 1390.42s]  I have to calm down.
[1390.42s -> 1408.81s]  How?
[1408.81s -> 1409.81s]  That was insane.
[1409.81s -> 1415.72s]  How did I not get any damage done?
[1415.72s -> 1416.72s]  Am I regenerating health?
[1416.72s -> 1417.72s]  This is what it's like when you're in a dream.
[1417.72s -> 1418.72s]  That's what it looks like when you're flying around in a dream.
[1418.72s -> 1420.47s]  All right.
[1420.47s -> 1438.03s]  Now where's the lightsaber training?
[1438.03s -> 1439.03s]  Password.
[1439.03s -> 1441.10s]  Leaning.
[1441.10s -> 1442.10s]  So now what?
[1442.10s -> 1443.47s]  Do I get on the ground fighting?
[1443.47s -> 1451.05s]  Okay.
[1451.05s -> 1452.05s]  It's a static shot.
[1452.05s -> 1453.22s]  Sure.
[1453.22s -> 1454.22s]  Wasn't that funny?
[1454.22s -> 1458.86s]  My bit rate is really low right now.
[1458.86s -> 1460.10s]  Okay.
[1460.10s -> 1461.10s]  Okay.
[1461.10s -> 1469.70s]  Okay.
[1470.70s -> 1471.70s]  Wait, is there an internet problem?
[1471.70s -> 1475.30s]  It's like, oh, no, no, no.
[1475.30s -> 1476.30s]  Right.
[1476.30s -> 1477.30s]  Right.
[1477.30s -> 1479.31s]  Right.
[1479.31s -> 1480.31s]  There's like fucking a thousand kilobytes of data on the screen right now.
[1480.31s -> 1481.31s]  I'll lower it.
[1481.31s -> 1482.31s]  It's a little up.
[1482.31s -> 1483.31s]  Vader.
[1483.31s -> 1484.31s]  Vader.
[1484.31s -> 1485.31s]  Within moments, our troops will board their ship.
[1485.31s -> 1486.31s]  We'll then have the stolen plans back in our possession and Princess Leia as well.
[1486.31s -> 1497.54s]  Excellent.
[1497.54s -> 1500.06s]  I shall oversee her interrogation personally.
[1500.06s -> 1504.75s]  Uh-oh.
[1504.75s -> 1505.75s]  Fake actor.
[1505.75s -> 1506.75s]  Okay.
[1506.75s -> 1541.84s]  I'm just waiting for a guy to turn the corner that's supposed to be your dad, but he doesn't
[1541.84s -> 1542.84s]  look like your dad at all.
[1542.84s -> 1543.84s]  He has a mustache on.
[1543.84s -> 1544.84s]  Your dad doesn't have a mustache, but it's your dad and your dream.
[1544.84s -> 1545.84s]  It's fucking weird.
[1545.84s -> 1546.84s]  I'm going to regret this.
[1546.84s -> 1548.98s]  This thing is safe.
[1548.98s -> 1549.98s]  Battle station plans are not on board this ship and no transmissions were made.
[1549.98s -> 1550.98s]  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting.
[1550.98s -> 1556.06s]  No life forms were present.
[1556.06s -> 1557.06s]  She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
[1557.06s -> 1562.84s]  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
[1562.84s -> 1563.84s]  See to it personally, Commander.
[1563.84s -> 1564.84s]  Okay.
[1564.84s -> 1565.84s]  Darth Vader is dead in that chair.
[1565.84s -> 1566.84s]  Somebody's holding his mask from behind and doing a voice.
[1566.84s -> 1567.84s]  Oh, he's just sitting there.
[1567.84s -> 1569.02s]  Okay.
[1569.02s -> 1570.02s]  Uh-oh.
[1570.02s -> 1571.02s]  Emergency.
[1571.02s -> 1572.02s]  I took the animator a full three days to do that, by the way.
[1572.02s -> 1573.02s]  You just watched.
[1573.02s -> 1574.02s]  Lift it up.
[1574.02s -> 1575.02s]  Drink it.
[1575.02s -> 1576.02s]  Put it down.
[1576.02s -> 1577.02s]  It's a full day of work.
[1577.02s -> 1578.02s]  I'm ready.
[1578.02s -> 1579.02s]  Let's go.
[1579.02s -> 1580.02s]  Let's go.
[1580.02s -> 1581.02s]  Let's go.
[1581.02s -> 1582.02s]  Let's go.
[1582.02s -> 1583.02s]  Let's go.
[1583.02s -> 1584.02s]  Let's go.
[1584.02s -> 1585.02s]  Let's go.
[1585.02s -> 1586.02s]  Let's go.
[1586.02s -> 1591.22s]  Let's go.
[1591.22s -> 1593.94s]  Let's go.
[1593.94s -> 1594.94s]  Let's go.
[1594.94s -> 1595.94s]  Let's go.
[1595.94s -> 1606.39s]  Let's go.
[1606.39s -> 1607.39s]  Let's go.
[1607.39s -> 1608.39s]  Let's go.
[1608.39s -> 1609.39s]  Let's go.
[1609.39s -> 1610.39s]  Let's go.
[1610.39s -> 1611.39s]  Let's go.
[1611.39s -> 1612.39s]  Let's go.
[1612.39s -> 1618.69s]  Uh-oh.
[1618.69s -> 1619.69s]  Emergency.
[1619.69s -> 1627.90s]  I took the animator a full three days to do that, by the way.
[1627.90s -> 1628.90s]  You just watched.
[1628.90s -> 1630.21s]  Lift it up.
[1630.21s -> 1631.21s]  Drink it.
[1631.21s -> 1632.21s]  Put it down.
[1632.21s -> 1633.21s]  It's a full day of work.
[1633.21s -> 1634.21s]  I'm ready.
[1634.21s -> 1642.74s]  Let's go.
[1642.74s -> 1643.74s]  Let's go.
[1643.74s -> 1644.74s]  Let's go.
[1644.74s -> 1654.05s]  Seems a very enthusiastic.
[1654.05s -> 1655.05s]  We have to take out the command center.
[1655.05s -> 1656.05s]  Watch out.
[1656.05s -> 1657.05s]  There's a ton on the line.
[1657.05s -> 1658.05s]  Here we go.
[1658.05s -> 1662.49s]  Wait.
[1662.49s -> 1663.49s]  Wait.
[1663.49s -> 1666.33s]  Don't go that, uh, how do I?
[1666.33s -> 1685.26s]  Star Fox? Um, sorry, Star Fox is shitty Star Wars. Can you rephrase that please? Cut his
[1685.26s -> 1706.02s]  mic. No, can we be, let's be real, Star Fox is Star Wars with animals. I love Star Fox,
[1706.02s -> 1711.02s]  it's like one of my favorite games, especially the one for 64. Star Fox 64 might be one of
[1711.02s -> 1720.11s]  the best games ever made. In fact it is, why would I even say it might be? I'm actually
[1720.11s -> 1736.40s]  doing pretty good. I can't wait to get, when does it, I gotta get to the lightsaber fight
[1736.40s -> 1750.74s]  with Darth Vader. You're one hit away from death. Don't distract me like that. How many
[1750.74s -> 1763.61s]  of these fucking things exist? Don't hit the wall, don't hit the wall. Alright, let's take
[1763.61s -> 1781.06s]  out the things on top. I did my work, can I do the other thing? There's nothing left.
[1781.06s -> 1787.46s]  This is fun. I am having a great time. I love this, I'm so happy right now. I feel like
[1787.46s -> 1805.04s]  my son was just born. Is this what it feels like? Get it! No, I don't want to do another
[1816.48s -> 1826.40s]  cool Redditor soy boy. What? Because he's comparing the 3DO, playing it for the first
[1826.40s -> 1831.00s]  time with having a child be born. Alright, I'll give you that one. You can have that
[1831.00s -> 1845.74s]  one. Yeah, that's fine, you can have it. Kind of true, actually. Well, whatever. I don't
[1845.74s -> 1852.39s]  have a son, I don't know what it's like. I have to imagine something like this. Okay,
[1852.39s -> 1874.87s]  please don't die. Don't die, just kill the thing. Don't crash into the wall. How do
[1874.87s -> 1899.54s]  I have to? Torpedo's armed. Shoot it! Shoot it there! Did I get it? Oh, I got it. Having
[1899.54s -> 1919.97s]  children is like playing Donkey Kong. We got more. I got to be careful with this controller.
[1923.41s -> 1934.04s]  Is he alright? Oh, he's not. I feel like this controller feels so delicate that I feel like
[1934.04s -> 1937.64s]  if I mash buttons and hold it tightly I'm going to mess it up. You know when you have
[1937.64s -> 1941.88s]  your friend over that's a big strong person and you give them the controller and you don't
[1941.88s -> 1945.24s]  like how hard they're pressing the buttons but you can't find the strength to say anything
[1945.24s -> 1955.10s]  about it? You can hear the like, and you're like, ah, fuck, I wish I could fucking be
[1955.10s -> 1976.71s]  like, dude, yes, don't fucking do that so hard. That's my shit. Okay, I got him. I did
[1976.71s -> 2015.37s]  it. Dermas of Beta. What? Yes, time to get on the ground. How many times have I said
[2015.37s -> 2029.49s]  yes in the first 30 minutes of this stream? Holy shit, I can kill AT-STs in one hit. I'm
[2029.49s -> 2055.85s]  kind of low to the ground, don't you think? It's 18. Shit, alright, left side. Just do
[2055.85s -> 2073.12s]  a Jerma joke and crash. I can't. The game is on rails right now. I cannot crash. Give
[2073.12s -> 2078.98s]  a shitty blaster? I'm killing things in one hit. That's not shitty, that's really good.
[2078.98s -> 2101.32s]  29. What's 30? 31. Oh, 32. Who's left? Am I single-handedly destroying everything? This
[2101.32s -> 2122.96s]  ain't like Galaga, right? I don't have to kill everything. Is it? 40? That's not real.
[2122.96s -> 2147.83s]  I got 44. Did I lose? I didn't lose, right? No, good, good, good. L-W-Y-L-L. Tony Hawk?
[2147.83s -> 2173.08s]  I played Tony Hawk already. Oh, it's R2-D2. No, I played Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk Underground,
[2173.08s -> 2179.30s]  Tony Hawk 1. I did them all. If you think you're going to get anything good from me,
[2179.30s -> 2191.76s]  from Tony Hawk, no. You're going to have to teleport back to when I was 16. Don't do,
[2192.64s -> 2200.60s]  don't lose, don't lose. The new one. Wait, what do you mean? Didn't they just remaster the first
[2200.60s -> 2214.12s]  two? I don't even know what to drive to get away from this. God damn it. Okay. All right,
[2214.12s -> 2223.86s]  all right, all right. I'm fine, I'm fine. I have plenty of lives. How old is Jerma? 28.
[2224.74s -> 2241.70s]  And then in parentheses, plus seven. I am dodging. What are you talking about? I don't.
[2252.52s -> 2263.72s]  I'm going to get hit by the asteroid. Calm down, I'm fine. Don't hold it. Don't death grip this
[2263.72s -> 2289.28s]  thing. Shit. Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it. Kill that guy,
[2289.28s -> 2303.22s]  kill him. Oh my God damn it. Play Doom for the 3DO. I got plenty of fucking video games. Don't
[2303.22s -> 2314.92s]  you worry. Don't just focus on dodging, nothing else. The amount of damage that the asteroids do
[2314.92s -> 2326.47s]  is pales in comparison to what? Down or left? Down or left or right? Right. How am I not dodging
[2326.47s -> 2340.18s]  that? I very much am. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Which way? Which way? Which way? Up,
[2340.18s -> 2353.19s]  up, up, up, up, up, up. We're fine. Did I actually get hit by it? There's no way. Damn it. Okay,
[2353.19s -> 2361.41s]  don't get mad at the first game. You can't do that. They programmed this game on a toaster,
[2361.41s -> 2374.40s]  okay? You can't get mad at this. All right, if I lose another life, I'm just going to chip
[2374.40s -> 2384.71s]  chip away at change games. It was actually a microwave. When I get to zero, I'll do that.
[2384.71s -> 2395.91s]  I love Star Wars. Just hold on. How was that not a dodge? Run that back and tell me. I'm going all
[2395.91s -> 2428.68s]  the way to the right. Just dodge everything. The fuck? How do you dodge in a game that's on rails?
[2428.68s -> 2442.28s]  It's all right. Since when did looking in another direction dodge your car? It's not like somebody's
[2442.28s -> 2446.84s]  driving straight at me and I go, oh shit. I lean my body to the left and not turn the wheel.
[2448.20s -> 2474.08s]  I'm not going to do anything. Thank God. No, no, no, no. Dude, what? What are you talking about?
[2482.32s -> 2486.88s]  I was holding the controller all the way to the right and I still got hit by that one.
[2486.88s -> 2505.70s]  Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. It's right. It's right. I remember. I've memorized
[2505.70s -> 2521.01s]  the whole damn thing. I got to get the password for this one. Fuck you. Come on. All the way,
[2521.01s -> 2523.97s]  all the way, all the way. Don't hold down. Don't. All the way, all the way, all the way,
[2523.97s -> 2531.72s]  all the way. Which one is this one? Up? I don't know. I have no idea. Up? Left? Right? I don't
[2531.72s -> 2575.62s]  know. I can't even see them coming at you. I don't know. Down? Down, I think. Fuck. I'm okay. Can
[2575.62s -> 2581.65s]  this please end so I can get the password? Please. Don't fucking drive into me, dude. What are you
[2581.65s -> 2586.16s]  doing? Give me the password for the next one. Give me the password for this one. Give me the password,
[2586.16s -> 2588.08s]  password. Give me the password right now. Give me the password, password, password, password, password,
[2588.08s -> 2594.47s]  I don't care what is give you a password for that since it's wouldn't give you a password I want play lightsaber level
[2595.01s -> 2602.30s]  That's not cheating I didn't he drove into be they guys an asshole I hear all the passwords
[2602.30s -> 2603.56s]  nice okay good perfect
[2603.56s -> 2617.63s]  Okay, so level one all right cool. I don't want a high score next game. Hold on I like this one
[2617.89s -> 2621.90s]  Let's go with a
[2621.90s -> 2626.10s]  Okay
[2626.10s -> 2644.03s]  Mazak? Mazak. No. So why don't give him that he's gonna keep playing this. I like this one
[2644.03s -> 2650.90s]  I'm sorry. It's been it's been 30 minutes. I'm gonna go. I'm breaking the rule. It was it has to be at least 30 minutes
[2651.06s -> 2689.20s]  Yeah, but don't worry. I have it. I'm like it. Okay, mazic. Let's see what it does. Just watch the cutscenes
[2689.92s -> 2698.74s]  Wait, I'll put the next one in the wrong password. I might come back and play this one though
[2698.74s -> 2706.27s]  I actually like this one. I think there's more to see
[2709.37s -> 2711.33s]  next is
[2711.33s -> 2714.14s]  twisted the game show
[2714.16s -> 2732.17s]  You're gonna see the colored the colored bars thing wanting you you're gonna see it right now. All right. This next one
[2748.16s -> 2753.19s]  All I saw with this one is the box I just turned it on to make sure it worked
[2753.81s -> 2773.80s]  I think this one's going to be insane. We go. These are collectible items. I'm not gonna
[2774.00s -> 2786.85s]  I gotta make sure I keep these in a good spot. Yeah, I'm using the retro tink 2x Pro things. Awesome. We go

[7022.52s -> 7024.52s]  I
[7026.16s -> 7028.16s]  Look it over there and I see a bunch of gems

[7398.04s -> 7408.91s]  Okay
[7408.91s -> 7414.88s]  Statistically speaking we should pick the caveman. It's a rerun episode
[7415.92s -> 7418.84s]  No, but now that you can't pick the caveman because now it's never gonna happen again
[7419.52s -> 7425.58s]  That's how illogical the world is I could happen ten times in a row and then when you pick it
[7425.74s -> 7432.32s]  It it never happens ever again. I'm doing it
[7434.98s -> 7441.93s]  Cavemen and cavemen and the and like the fosters home for imaginary friends crew

[7466.84s -> 7476.60s]  I see a plane in first place and it's pissing me off already
[7485.26s -> 7493.20s]  No, all right, it's okay. It's all right. We still have another guy
[7503.28s -> 7507.57s]  These cars are made out of shit

[7561.14s -> 7576.50s]  Oh
[7578.82s -> 7585.89s]  Come on how many one two three four five six seven eight nine was a ten
[7586.89s -> 7590.25s]  Chance to win every single time. We've lost every single time right or a little bit more

[7651.72s -> 7654.92s]  They've never won in a single fucking episode. This is ridiculous
[7655.44s -> 7661.07s]  No, they don't win
[7661.11s -> 7664.13s]  They're a plot device to teach you lessons
[7664.71s -> 7673.32s]  Like brush your teeth and to always like be kind to your neighbor and shit. I'm doing it again
[7673.68s -> 7690.98s]  All right, we're going we'll go with a wild card here penis car
[7691.86s -> 7694.54s]  We have not seen a single penis car win
[7697.80s -> 7704.38s]  We've seen almost every other person win it's been to that heaven we're gonna go with the odds of it's time

[7785.60s -> 7791.67s]  Because he's a gentleman
[7795.84s -> 7798.28s]  All right, and I'll be pissed in and
[7799.52s -> 7807.98s]  We'll be in tweedle dumb up there. I have one twice each. I think it's time to go with the trend. I'm going okay

[8518.13s -> 8526.38s]  This is so basic and simple, but I don't know. It's kind of doing it for me. All right cavemen
[8526.90s -> 8533.28s]  Well

[11429.59s -> 11434.35s]  We can make a bubsy character that does the same thing that bubsy does but not have the game making one to throw up and

[11620.63s -> 11626.96s]  On them
[11627.68s -> 11630.31s]  That camera
[11630.35s -> 11632.96s]  How do I get that?
[11632.96s -> 11648.57s]  Radio fucking sucks. It doesn't know it does not how dare you say something like that
[11649.37s -> 11661.34s]  Can you imagine unironically?
[11661.62s -> 11665.94s]  Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot text text text text text text. You know, I mean
[11678.85s -> 11681.41s]  It still hit me up
[11684.57s -> 11688.60s]  Don't fall in that water
[11702.00s -> 11708.25s]  I'm gonna give us another ten minutes. I like it, but I
[11709.05s -> 11713.45s]  Like it, but you know, it's one of those scenarios. I like it, but
[11716.40s -> 11726.39s]  Speed run on this game
[11726.39s -> 11744.88s]  We got that info. What are you minutes? I'm gonna say 30 minutes. It's only so fast. You can go through these levels
[11744.88s -> 11762.85s]  I want that full health careful. I don't want to mash on the controller. This thing's expensive
[11763.85s -> 11774.47s]  It's a 30-minute nap music's not good
[11777.74s -> 11796.95s]  Yeah, yeah, this could be better radio cost like $800 we have lunch no idea
[11801.04s -> 11803.04s]  It's pretty expensive now
[11804.60s -> 11808.77s]  799 holy shit, that's insane
[11810.09s -> 11815.34s]  It was 699
[11815.34s -> 11820.97s]  What was their intention with 3do?
[11821.29s -> 11827.76s]  It wanted like a big home entertainment system, but
[11828.68s -> 11834.02s]  What eventually didn't they want to have like into the fully interactive movies on here and shit?
[11836.81s -> 11839.53s]  It was a goal with this radio they never achieved. What was it?
[11851.21s -> 11871.56s]  Come on fuck it's ten, right?
[11878.03s -> 11894.75s]  Well, I got a remote. Holy shit. I got a remote
[11898.87s -> 11902.42s]  Oh

[11931.50s -> 11933.50s]  dangerous very very dangerous
[11934.14s -> 11959.87s]  It's pretty good cat puke noises. I would say there's a remote right there, right? No, what is this tape?
[11960.51s -> 11977.34s]  That is wild
[11978.30s -> 11982.84s]  That's my favorite one. Oh, that's why that's wild stuff. That's Johnny Carson
[11983.84s -> 11996.80s]  Nice touch. I have a remote. I didn't get a remote. I thought I got one from the bonus round
[11999.38s -> 12001.74s]  We told you yeah, but I thought I
[12002.70s -> 12007.27s]  Know I don't have to do this. Oh, come on. No
[12009.19s -> 12018.98s]  I'm gonna go very fast again. Get it. I care about any power-ups go

[12378.01s -> 12387.10s]  I feel like I'm gonna think I love this game or I'm going to hate it. I think I'm gonna love it or hate it
[12387.58s -> 12406.54s]  Okay, I gotta tell you a MIDI track does not work on this footage
[12407.06s -> 12426.42s]  Doesn't sound very badass. Is this real footage though? I'm confused. It's a real footage game
[12427.02s -> 12428.74s]  You actually drive a car
[12428.74s -> 12435.84s]  It is real footage. Oh, yes
[12436.44s -> 12447.23s]  road and
[12447.23s -> 12463.94s]  Track presents the need for speed. Well, this is it whatever red blooded land love and land speed record want to be ever wanted
[12464.46s -> 12470.67s]  Free ticket in the rock of your dreams again one way to camera pointing down ride. You won't die looking up
[12471.39s -> 12473.95s]  Fasten your seatbelts
[12474.03s -> 12488.87s]  EA Canada

[12499.25s -> 12511.26s]  Start I press start. Oh, it's waiting. Oh, look at how cool this guy is
[12512.02s -> 12514.37s]  All right. What do I do?
[12514.65s -> 12516.65s]  What do these mean?
[12516.69s -> 12521.21s]  This is I this is scrapbook. I don't know what to do with this. Okay, I'm gonna click on him
[12529.06s -> 12530.18s]  Alright, this is how it works
[12530.18s -> 12535.94s]  You can stroll this puppy out and go up against the best times or you can stick your ego on the chopping block and make
[12535.94s -> 12543.28s]  This an old-fashioned gunfight. What does that mean? Is that a race? Is that a fight? Is that like a test?
[12543.28s -> 12546.36s]  I'm taking is that what is that? What is that? What's he referring to?
[12547.00s -> 12551.60s]  Did I just order something from a diner? I don't know what that was
[12561.77s -> 12563.82s]  I'm gonna click the road
[12563.82s -> 12566.00s]  city
[12566.04s -> 12571.48s]  11.8 miles from the tranquility of suburbia to the pandemonium of the urban jungle
[12571.64s -> 12576.52s]  This route opens up with gentle freeway and winds its way to the bowels of the city's underground
[12576.52s -> 12579.96s]  Oh deep poopoo. He said bowels snaking everywhere. That's quick
[12579.96s -> 12585.52s]  It overpasses concrete barriers long winding tunnels. It's all here for you, but watch out for traffic
[12585.52s -> 12588.76s]  It comes up real quick when you're at speeds these cars want to travel
[12589.64s -> 12592.20s]  187 miles. Why would you ever drive that fast on a regular street?
[12592.84s -> 12609.42s]  Let's go, it's like my car at Lamborghini Diablo VT next
[12613.42s -> 12621.50s]  All wheel drive helps with the VT's 492 brake horsepower to the ground up to 15% of the power is put through to the
[12621.50s -> 12626.02s]  Front wheels don't care about any of it. I don't care about any of these things low speed turns
[12626.02s -> 12629.74s]  But the rear drive care I don't care about the coordinates. I don't give a shit about how fast you go
[12630.38s -> 12638.92s]  I don't need the things to spread $252,000. All right, whatever. I don't you see your math problems. I get it
[12638.92s -> 12642.48s]  It's fast. You just could look me in the guy look me and go car goes very fast
[12647.63s -> 12652.58s]  Dangerous first is in trouble. This one is hydroplaning cool
[12653.10s -> 12679.43s]  Zero zero to sixty. Yeah, I love the zero to sixty shit who cares
[12680.07s -> 12689.28s]  Zero to sixty in ten seconds. Oh, were you in a school zone? You're under arrest
[12689.92s -> 12698.39s]  When does zero to sixty mean anything helps put the VT's 492 brake horsepower to the ground up to 15
[12698.43s -> 12705.92s]  No, I don't want to watch the video again. Get me out of here when you are racing. You know, what are you gonna wear?
[12705.92s -> 12707.04s]  You're racing this
[12707.04s -> 12711.81s]  You're commuting to work with this thing. Good thing this thing goes zero to sixty
[12712.31s -> 12718.75s]  So I can be at the red light and step on the gas and then get a three hundred dollar speeding ticket
[12719.15s -> 12735.70s]  Yeah, that's pretty biased as people used to drive by my house at like 80 miles per hour
[12735.70s -> 12738.84s]  Yeah, I'm a little biased. How do I get away from this video?
[12745.78s -> 12757.26s]  Wait, what is this? These are other cars. Okay, I press B. Does B leave
[12765.63s -> 12767.63s]  The wrong side of the road he's gonna hurt somebody
[12768.23s -> 12788.17s]  He was swerving into the other lane. I'm gonna play the game. How do I play the game?
[12788.33s -> 12795.58s]  Is it not a game the small size of the Yarek? Okay, how do I go back?
[12797.74s -> 12800.30s]  select
[12800.54s -> 12809.00s]  Okay, we're good. Okay. This has a wheel on it. I'm assuming that means drive the car skill level. Sure
[12809.60s -> 12811.90s]  Audio this is the options menu
[12812.54s -> 12816.06s]  Okay, this is the options menu
[12816.42s -> 12849.68s]  Just drive the car. Do I get to pick my car? How do you drive? We get a three two one
[12850.20s -> 12878.15s]  What's the three two one go? He has the parking brake on how do you turn the parking brake off? I'm in neutral
[12878.15s -> 12882.89s]  Oh, there we go. Got it
[12882.89s -> 12885.51s]  No, that's reverse
[12885.55s -> 12902.82s]  More than you bargained for too real for you. How are you? I'd keep this little episode quiet
[12903.10s -> 12910.88s]  Why are we in the woods? Did we just murder somebody together? We just bury a body. I don't understand
[12910.88s -> 12912.88s]  I don't know. I'm gonna put my name in
[12915.92s -> 12919.31s]  Real height
[12928.30s -> 12943.18s]  There's no context to any of this am I lying on the ground in agony, okay, so let's get it into board
[12943.34s -> 12954.66s]  Do you have the manual? I don't think it matters. Okay. Here we go. Is it in drive put it into fucking drive
[12954.66s -> 12971.92s]  I don't know how I get up with it. I was a manual first gear. All right second gear
[12971.92s -> 13000.16s]  Let's go third gear fourth gear fifth gear. Are these people not part of the race?
[13000.74s -> 13029.22s]  But it's odd. Is it auto shifting? There is there's that motherfucker right there in that red car. I think she's gonna get away
[13029.46s -> 13035.19s]  Nope
[13035.19s -> 13045.74s]  Get the police on me. Why is he still such a little blob? All right, here we go
[13045.74s -> 13048.26s]  I'm going like how fast we go like 500 miles per hour
[13048.98s -> 13071.46s]  Come on. Hurry up judging from the dashboard. This is like my grandfather's car. What are we even driving? Don't shift so soon
[13071.46s -> 13077.89s]  It's on auto. I'm not doing that shit. I got a ride in the breakdown lane
[13077.89s -> 13091.08s]  I got 160 miles per hour. This car doesn't go faster than a hundred and like 70 miles per hour
[13091.08s -> 13100.70s]  What is it the pass them? I passed them
[13102.33s -> 13121.04s]  Yet, how do you win the race he didn't say there was a beginning a middle or an end
[13121.04s -> 13129.76s]  He just made fun of me and looked down at me three times. How do I win this? He's long gone
[13129.76s -> 13155.91s]  I blew by him a long time ago. Where's the end this level? There is no end how yes
[13155.91s -> 13165.42s]  There is that has to be you think that guy just gave up and was like, all right. Well, whatever. I'm done

[13183.03s -> 13185.27s]  167 miles per hour top speed
[13185.39s -> 13208.37s]  Steal becoming one. Yeah, he waxed my ass. Congratulations waxed his ass. He was in the lead for like 15 straight minutes
[13208.37s -> 13210.83s]  Are you sure he didn't win?
[13210.83s -> 13212.83s]  replay highlight reel
[13213.35s -> 13237.02s]  Let's take a look at the highlight reel. It's just real time
[13244.07s -> 13246.07s]  Okay, it's
[13246.07s -> 13251.00s]  We can skip that part
[13255.21s -> 13283.06s]  Okay, just get out. What is it is the audio is too early. What do you mean like the in-game audios too early one guy?
[13283.06s -> 13296.60s]  Okay, I'm doing it again. I'm racing the same guy. I'm gonna do the same thing
[13298.54s -> 13322.27s]  different track
[13329.16s -> 13340.80s]  I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. You've waited for me
[13341.52s -> 13351.76s]  Wax his ass. I'm gum. What do you think I'm trying to do?
[13352.16s -> 13374.84s]  Change the camera, but now it looks like an ugly video game this ticking sound
[13374.84s -> 13396.43s]  I don't get it. You go all the way up the police show up do anything last time. Yeah, I just hit the cop
[13396.43s -> 13437.85s]  That's exist cop car. I just hit him. Wow, you suck pull over should I where is
[13444.36s -> 13462.24s]  Speeding I look dumbfounded. Here's the goal
[13462.24s -> 13469.16s]  Can I catch up after getting a speeding ticket crash into him?
[13469.16s -> 13499.87s]  I must killed that guy the cars in neutral right now. No this am I gonna get two speeding tickets. All right, come on officer
[13499.87s -> 13502.81s]  I'm right here
[13502.93s -> 13522.75s]  The cars so I got out of one somebody pulled up another one and I'm still about to pass this guy
[13522.91s -> 13543.94s]  Shit, it's gonna be a photo finish. Please. Shit. Your horn is the biggest wuss horn. I've ever heard in my life
[13544.26s -> 13558.06s]  That's not intimidating at all, dude, that's does not say fuck you
[13558.06s -> 13577.10s]  Oh shit a cop's gonna get me game just didn't let me crash into okay, but I'll pull over what about him
[13577.10s -> 13593.15s]  Look at how fast he's going. Yeah, pull that guy over my pulling him over. I can't drive. I'm holding down the button
[13593.51s -> 13608.84s]  What's going on? Well, I do believe I got me my first UFO capture
[13608.84s -> 13628.89s]  You better start turning green real fast gizmo or the National Enquirer ain't gonna buy my story. What I got to I get two cars left
[13631.95s -> 13646.16s]  Assume the position fast boy. Now you're in the fast lane to the county jail. Did you walk up to the car with a shotgun?
[13646.56s -> 13657.37s]  Let's go
[13657.37s -> 13663.98s]  Okay, you want to talk about like 20 20 video cuts you put handcuffs on me, which takes about one second
[13663.98s -> 13670.56s]  They were probably probably 12 cuts and that three seconds to put on a pair of fucking handcuffs
[13670.88s -> 13692.57s]  How many times I have to beat this guy before we can is over you didn't win. All right, I'm gonna win
[13694.37s -> 13702.20s]  I need first-person driving. It helps. I want to see what happens if I beat him
[13702.40s -> 13743.69s]  Don't have to beat him. It's gonna be the fastest. You've ever seen somebody do this course stop pretending
[13743.69s -> 13751.85s]  It's no such thing as pretending while you're going 160 miles per hour. It's no nuance at 160
[13751.85s -> 13771.28s]  Don't pretend to go 160. I I cannot do that right now
[13771.48s -> 13794.01s]  The old strategy was just blow by the cup. I'm going too fast. I'm gonna catch up to me. Why doesn't he spin up?
[13794.01s -> 13801.61s]  Where's his?
[13801.61s -> 13810.67s]  Total cascading over on the side five out of ten link don't even bother
[13810.67s -> 13827.60s]  I got one guy said not to do it no more mess it around
[13827.60s -> 13837.14s]  I really don't want to do this again. I need to beat him three times. Sir. So don't even understand how that
[13837.46s -> 13875.89s]  He's gonna be right here. It's okay. Forget about the cop. I'm gonna blow right by him again and clear here
[13875.89s -> 13899.28s]  He is absolutely gonna buy him ride the breakdown lane. That's the best strategy so far this thing up to 160 easy easy
[13899.28s -> 13912.56s]  I'm coming up quick. See you later. All right, good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good on to the next chapter
[13912.56s -> 13944.88s]  I passed him on the inside. You know, it looked at chat. I looked at chat. All right, let's beat him again
[13944.88s -> 13953.96s]  I'll tell it look if it's if it's a five out of ten is average
[13953.96s -> 13962.31s]  Let's take a look you got the nerve to push the envelope man got some skill
[13962.31s -> 13980.27s]  That's that's what it takes. I'm hanging out with this guy in the woods every time. I mean that is a what do you want me to do?
[13980.75s -> 13989.88s]  round two
[13989.88s -> 14003.07s]  continue
[14003.35s -> 14007.48s]  Next game I got to beat this guy three times we change
[14007.96s -> 14024.45s]  So much faster than me off the gun. It's like it's the type type of car that he has
[14024.45s -> 14030.90s]  I'm so bad at you. I need to be driving in first person. I can't drive like this
[14030.90s -> 14040.83s]  I need the wheel to guide me you guys want to stay on the driving theme should I put in road rash?
[14041.15s -> 14062.30s]  We want something completely different and John bad. No, I think we're gonna hold on to John bad
[14062.30s -> 14109.06s]  There is no music. That's weird. Where's the music idiot move the radio on? I don't have a radio. Well by the cop
[14109.18s -> 14135.16s]  No, go go go go go quick quick quick quick. Go go go. He's right behind it go

[14167.51s -> 14179.39s]  What why did I reach out? I gotta stop looking at that. Don't look at that every gun
[14179.39s -> 14188.44s]  Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me. Don't look at chat again red guy coming up on this side
[14188.44s -> 14201.51s]  I got a Mario car. No, no don't let him go in front of me. No, he passed me. I'm gonna get in trouble
[14201.51s -> 14240.92s]  Oh, it's okay speeding ticket. Here's your reddit gold, sir. I'm gonna crash again if I'm not careful
[14240.92s -> 14262.18s]  I don't want to lose this it's so if the cop passes you that's how you get inside
[14262.18s -> 14283.72s]  Oh over the checkpoint very close very close. You pulled it off
[14283.72s -> 14290.58s]  The next thing you know, you're gonna be getting a sponsorship a race with the big boys all mama, but yeah, I hate this guy
[14291.46s -> 14296.96s]  Here we go. We got a new cutscene
[14301.89s -> 14304.06s]  first
[14304.06s -> 14310.41s]  speed
[14310.41s -> 14321.28s]  champion on the road and in your face what a drive what a
[14321.88s -> 14326.40s]  Driver all the scale all the thrill hard driving man. You blow me away
[14326.76s -> 14332.20s]  Yeah, the thrill the finish line is just the start man. You are bound for glory with your foot to the floor, baby
[14332.20s -> 14337.06s]  Wow, you need to drop the exposure on your webcam and put up the lighting in your room
[14337.06s -> 14338.82s]  That's why it looks like that guy
[14338.86s -> 14359.30s]  Okay, so do I just race him now what oh shit, okay, is that the whole game I
[14359.98s -> 14368.03s]  Just beat the game
[14368.03s -> 14378.75s]  Link link. All right. I'm clicking now. I got it. That's not even the right one
[14378.75s -> 14386.67s]  That's another one. That's a cop handing you something through the window. Not the right one. Is this the right win?
[14387.27s -> 14390.34s]  This is the right one. That is not worth it
[14390.70s -> 14440.32s]  It's not worth it also wrong. Okay, how about what give me the right one then? All right, whatever city
[14441.32s -> 14444.50s]  Alpine coastal. All right, we're going coastal
[14446.81s -> 14449.05s]  Definitely going coastal
[14449.69s -> 14467.15s]  This is the last race I'm gonna do and then I'm just gonna turn it off and then we'll put it in I
[14467.63s -> 14470.13s]  Think we change I'm gonna change the theme up a little bit here
[14470.65s -> 14475.71s]  Yeah, it's time for a theme change. They pick a different car
[14483.47s -> 14506.38s]  What happens if I kill him? Oh, what a race?
[14506.90s -> 14536.54s]  All right, I'm done. This was fun. I'm done moving on what we got next. I mean, this was not fun
[14537.54s -> 14551.49s]  Madden all right. I'm gonna put in madden. I'm putting it in we're gonna get it off with I'll give you a choice
[14552.01s -> 14577.10s]  your choices are
[14577.10s -> 14593.29s]  John Madden the original video game on a sports direction here. You can either do John Madden or
[14594.82s -> 14620.30s]  Wicked 18 which is a golf game one for John Madden two for wicked golf. Yeah, this is tough
[14622.91s -> 14624.83s]  neither one of them
[14624.83s -> 14634.30s]  Do an actual poll. All right, we'll do an actual poll because this is very difficult for me
[14634.34s -> 14654.83s]  There's drop all John Madden or wicked golf by the way
[14654.83s -> 14656.95s]  I want to make sure that I gotta get this has got to be very clear
[14657.11s -> 14665.72s]  Just because it's called wicked golf does not mean it's interesting. It's golf. So could be pretty pog
[14665.72s -> 14673.21s]  I don't know. We'll see John bad. No, it's original FMV John Madden
[14673.29s -> 14701.34s]  There's at least probably five to ten minutes of John Madden talking into the camera. I think it's gonna be wicked golf
[14701.58s -> 14716.61s]  Let's go to BRB for a second. I don't blow your eyes out third option. There is none
[14716.93s -> 14724.40s]  There's so many games back there
[14724.40s -> 14732.98s]  We got a look we have to get through the wicked 18s of the world before we get to the Jurassic Park interactive
[14733.18s -> 14757.04s]  That's gonna be holy shit. No, we don't
[14758.35s -> 14759.71s]  Yeah, we do
[14759.71s -> 14765.94s]  About 40 of these I didn't buy like the ten good ones. I bought all 40
[14766.46s -> 14781.58s]  TV so why'd you do that? Because in 20 years is gonna be worth five grand
[14781.76s -> 14801.66s]  Wait, is this the thing that the arcades of the ball and you spin the ball as hard as you can golf?
[14801.86s -> 14809.40s]  There's the green why are we playing golf in
[14810.17s -> 14834.40s]  Egypt does not look at golf course because it's a wicked golf. Oh, sorry wicked 18 same damn thing. Who cares? Oh
[14840.31s -> 14843.39s]  whole number one par five champion teams
[14844.31s -> 14847.71s]  540 yards members teams 520 yards
[14849.73s -> 14856.13s]  The starting hole of devil's course is a part five that requires considerable skill water
[14856.25s -> 14864.33s]  Flanks both sides and rocks flow perilous. Why is this an eSports intro a good drive on a normal course may only find the rocks here
[14865.01s -> 14871.03s]  Fortunately, the approach is pretty easy after running this gauntlet. So a birdie is usual for this hole
[14872.15s -> 14884.96s]  Okay, use the driver every time I got it. It's the American Ninja Warrior intro
[14886.14s -> 14896.81s]  Okay member data. I mean was gonna what the hell game devil's open player one. That's an alien
[14899.18s -> 14909.26s]  Okay, sure. You weren't good at driving last game. What makes you think you'd be good at golf?
[14909.64s -> 14912.71s]  I'm gonna get a hole in one the first hit
[14913.29s -> 14916.69s]  First par two or par three that's available. I'm gonna get a hole in one
[14923.82s -> 14931.47s]  Just cardboard cutouts. Those are not real people
[14932.03s -> 14945.02s]  All right, first day player one versus Alan. Okay start this 17 holes here
[14947.72s -> 14980.28s]  How do you play him Alan the fucking volcano on the right he up. Oh, okay. Is he saying
[14982.71s -> 14984.47s]  Direction, okay direction
[14984.47s -> 14986.19s]  Where is the hole?
[14986.19s -> 14997.94s]  Pretty wood one wood. All right. I want the one wood. I'm just gonna hurt as hard as I can. Give me the one wood
[14998.40s -> 15001.53s]  Okay, you sure about that? Yeah, I'm sure
[15005.62s -> 15011.43s]  stance
[15011.43s -> 15013.43s]  Slice the fucking ball. Oh
[15018.64s -> 15038.04s]  Shit, that's just every single person at the driving range even go hit golf balls the driver
[15038.04s -> 15045.57s]  There's always somebody that just fucking skims it every single time. All right, let me try this again
[15045.77s -> 15058.60s]  Give me the one wood. No, I want the one wood. I'm going full power
[15058.76s -> 15071.60s]  I'm happy Gilmore in this shit over the mountain again
[15085.63s -> 15089.98s]  Embarrassing golfer I've ever seen
[15090.10s -> 15098.64s]  Music is so okay. Let's try it again. This guy's shit-faced
[15099.28s -> 15107.29s]  Well player one really probably shouldn't have come to the course after four Red Bull and vodkas
[15107.49s -> 15113.15s]  He's one of the top seeds. It's unfortunate to see him like this
[15113.55s -> 15122.88s]  then
[15123.16s -> 15124.52s]  People
[15124.52s -> 15136.34s]  Holy shit that bounce. Are you kidding me? There was some pinball level shit right there
[15136.34s -> 15139.92s]  All right, what do we think right through the middle? I'm gonna go right through the middle
[15140.24s -> 15164.42s]  What do you want to do to wood get it into the volcano? No, I'm going right through the middle bingo
[15164.54s -> 15183.26s]  How many strokes is this? Don't you just pick it up after seven? It's on acid
[15183.68s -> 15198.32s]  Okay, what point is the caddy just go? You know what? I'm gonna take over here, dude
[15198.44s -> 15199.86s]  Oh
[15199.86s -> 15212.06s]  Fuck so like every single golf game ever you do the power and then you press a again when it gets into the little middle
[15212.06s -> 15222.12s]  Thing right that's what I'm doing watch ready. I'm not doing it on purpose watch okay here
[15222.12s -> 15226.58s]  We go ready that bottom part is where I want to hit it here. We go power
[15227.18s -> 15251.83s]  Hey, hold it hold a all day and let go of a I try holding it and then let go of it
[15251.87s -> 15253.87s]  I'll try I am holding it
[15260.00s -> 15280.60s]  We good we live yeah, my internet didn't turn off my internet was fine
[15280.60s -> 15292.38s]  I don't that wasn't on my end my internet was perfectly fine. It's weird the twitch servers get nuked or something
[15292.38s -> 15306.00s]  That was weird. All right. We're back. I haven't even moved. Did you use that time to go look up how to play?
[15306.00s -> 15314.26s]  No, all right. Let's go which has been doing that lately. Oh, oh, oh well sorry about

[15330.72s -> 15335.24s]  Fucking I'm gonna miss that was such a bad miss that was a practice swing
[15335.68s -> 15346.88s]  So do I have to do it before I'm trying to do it while it lands in the thing in the middle
[15350.62s -> 15352.10s]  Here we go ready
[15352.10s -> 15368.74s]  Up up right. I'm pressing a I can't I don't get it. I do it. I'm doing it too early
[15369.42s -> 15390.31s]  Are you pressing a on the orange part? I'm trying to all right. I get it. I get it. I understand what's going on
[15390.31s -> 15398.13s]  I'm going way too far up cut the viewer count in half. Well, it's whatever. It's all good
[15398.57s -> 15411.13s]  You did this. All right, dude. Give me a fucking break
[15411.69s -> 15415.12s]  Really? Really?

[15466.63s -> 15475.48s]  Alright, can I can I hit it with it? Can I get it with the driver? I'm gonna go really small. Fuck the putter
[15475.48s -> 15478.00s]  I don't use putters only driver only one would
[15486.44s -> 15512.64s]  The crowd there is no crowd to hit those are paper cutouts. There we go on the green
[15512.72s -> 15539.74s]  That's like plus two meter. All right, it's a little bit slightly elevated. Can't even change clubs it in there
[15539.90s -> 15566.64s]  Okay, it's nine feet straight in. All right. What's that our player one plus twelve? What do you get? This is for birdie?
[15572.40s -> 15584.33s]  Wait, you got it. Damn it. I was gonna say that would have been way worse than me
[15584.41s -> 15607.68s]  Well number two coming up am I even on the board? All right now I get how the game works
[15617.00s -> 15633.88s]  We're going 300 yards straight ahead how much THC zero, all right
[15633.88s -> 15644.63s]  We got to try to get it right on the mountain. You could we sports music was that going?

[17951.85s -> 17960.80s]  Huh? All right. Do we end it with John Madden football or do we end it with another Japanese one that we can't understand or Road Rash?
[17960.80s -> 17970.86s]  That's right. Just end it with Madden. All right
[17970.86s -> 17977.50s]  I'm gonna end it with Madden so then we don't have to start with Madden tomorrow. That makes sense
[17977.70s -> 17985.88s]  Plus another reason why I want to give this a link kind of a break
[17987.20s -> 17989.64s]  It feels very it's very hot
[17989.64s -> 17995.75s]  I don't think they ever expected people to sit here for five hours straight to play this game on this console
[17996.03s -> 18010.65s]  It's it's pretty warm and it's it's very hot. We shall see here comes Madden tomorrow

[18206.50s -> 18210.40s]  I don't know. That was weird. Let's take a look at both teams. Here's how they match up
[18210.86s -> 18224.03s]  Okay, mine is to try harder. I'm that guy up for an hour
[18232.70s -> 18240.89s]  Why do they need an FMV for that
[18241.69s -> 18244.06s]  We won
[18246.26s -> 18248.26s]  We are going to receive the ball

[18266.81s -> 18274.09s]  I can't even unsee it that you've ruined everything you've ruined John Madden for me. Why did you do that to me?
[18294.68s -> 18296.68s]  Five-yard game. All right
[18298.77s -> 18303.22s]  We're gonna go here Hail Mary pass
[18303.62s -> 18310.64s]  I get John Madden's advice like you could do in the other games. I'm gonna go big shotgun
[18312.26s -> 18322.64s]  Quick slant. I don't even know how to play audible. No, I want to
[18332.56s -> 18335.44s]  I was trying to throw the ball
[18335.68s -> 18344.45s]  We do I don't know how to play
[18344.93s -> 18347.49s]  Pats suck, huh? No, they don't
[18348.21s -> 18349.93s]  Alright, how do you pass?
[18349.93s -> 18375.77s]  Start a fine
[18375.97s -> 18393.72s]  I'm trying to pass the ball. It's I think it's see you snap with C and then you pass this thing
[18393.80s -> 18413.48s]  Okay, here we go. You not catch that one. Why did he not catch it? Why did you do that? Just catch it
[18413.52s -> 18419.26s]  You were right there. Oh
[18419.26s -> 18430.70s]  Damn, we're all the way back here tack center. This game's really old as illegal to be offside. So find out
[18430.98s -> 18448.33s]  Yeah, it is. They can't go any further. So who cares? I'm going right for the quarterback right down the middle
[18448.53s -> 18464.57s]  The guy kicked me in the face. I'm Brady
[18467.39s -> 18469.51s]  What I'm not even trying to block the field
[18470.51s -> 18474.14s]  Oh
[18474.14s -> 18489.99s]  Let's go for some run plays. Where's John Madden did an intro and an outro and that's it
[18489.99s -> 18505.80s]  And he got paid like six million dollars for this. All right, let's try. I'm gonna try to get a touchdown right here
[18505.92s -> 18515.78s]  Let's do a good drive normal. I'm gonna do
[18516.74s -> 18523.98s]  Near let's just do right here. HB toss. Hold that right side like that ball deflated ball
[18524.48s -> 18530.87s]  Very very very funny. Nice block
[18532.03s -> 18534.27s]  You knock that guy in the ground and he got up and got me
[18534.75s -> 18545.01s]  Just think you guys don't understand like you could say deflated ball. I don't care. I'm not on the Patriots
[18545.01s -> 18554.34s]  I don't wait. Would you just say about hate? I want that fucking team. I've run that team
[18554.62s -> 18560.22s]  Don't you say that about my team? I'm on it. I don't know
[18560.22s -> 18569.04s]  I'm not I don't have any connection to the Patriots and the cuts cool. They have New England in front of it
[18570.88s -> 18592.98s]  All right, catch it. That was such a perfect pass to press again. Is there a catch button? I think it's a
[18593.54s -> 18603.64s]  Ref get the hell out of the way
[18604.40s -> 18637.05s]  Tackle the ref. I'm not sure you can do that. It is the floss. Oh shit. You're right. That's amazing
[18637.45s -> 18660.79s]  Okay, I wonder if a is the catch button or it's C C is you jump in the air like a block
[18661.31s -> 18676.97s]  Long as the quarter last in this game. Hopefully not that long. Come on
[18682.39s -> 18688.44s]  This is my drive right here. I don't win right here
[18689.10s -> 18702.96s]  But I'll get a touchdown right here. I'm turning it off. Okay, we can talk a lot of shit if we want
[18703.04s -> 18707.36s]  This actually is pretty good for an old 3DO game. I guess wide open. There's no way they don't catch this
[18716.58s -> 18725.86s]  You mean by I'm still on this plays pretty well for a game that's 20 fucking years old more than that
[18730.52s -> 18738.55s]  The open is weak
[18738.55s -> 18763.60s]  No, I'm not turning it off yet. Not yet. Is it second and ten? Okay run. Where's my blocking?
[18763.60s -> 18765.60s]  We're the block if that's where I was supposed to go to the left
[18766.84s -> 18768.95s]  Okay, I'm in trouble
[18768.99s -> 18775.06s]  Hail Mary it just in the end. Wait, I was supposed to go right shit
[18796.74s -> 18798.82s]  Okay, John do you need any toilet paper
[18799.58s -> 18832.92s]  Give me a baseball game and I'll wipe the floor with everything. I don't play football. I don't know anything about football
[18832.92s -> 18834.72s]  I don't care about football. I
[18834.72s -> 18838.85s]  Don't know. I thought I thought this is gonna be a game
[18838.85s -> 18843.01s]  We're like John Madden grabbed his stomach and like shook it up up and down a bunch of times. It was like
[18844.09s -> 18846.61s]  Welcome to the game punk. I don't know
[18847.41s -> 18849.79s]  Fmv game. I think it was gonna be like an actual football game
[18850.33s -> 18871.78s]  The amount of question marks right there. I'm gonna be in the bath later. I'm gonna be laughing my ass off
[18872.22s -> 18882.24s]  That's a turnover. I need to get at least a one touchdown
[18888.50s -> 18916.07s]  And get it where's it I gotta stop screaming dude, let's you turn it over and you punty immediately
[18935.91s -> 18941.22s]  This time for real we're gonna punt it I mean we're pretty far away
[18941.78s -> 18943.78s]  We don't have very we're down by a lot of points
[18950.37s -> 18971.05s]  Fire that guy. Okay, good. Awesome
[18971.69s -> 18978.50s]  We're getting close first and ten. I think we should probably punt it here
[18980.68s -> 18985.26s]  Isn't a punt here if it goes through you get points the one guy ever in history that did that
[18985.92s -> 19002.80s]  Second time why would you guys has his back turned to me?
[19016.66s -> 19035.82s]  Watch down there. It is we in New England easy. Yeah, I'm simple. I faked this
[19045.34s -> 19051.39s]  I wanted to do I just wanted to give one point. It's a fake
[19051.99s -> 19057.18s]  What do you got? I?
[19057.22s -> 19061.42s]  This is me kissing somebody no more kissing images. I don't know. I'm not looking at it
[19062.34s -> 19084.80s]  It's me kissing Tom Brady. He saved it. Yeah, okay
[19101.16s -> 19111.36s]  All right two-minute warning that of what quarter
[19114.64s -> 19128.14s]  Second quarter, I want one more possession with the ball. I'm gonna tie the game that I'm gonna turn it off
[19129.14s -> 19148.32s]  We're gonna Chuck a Chuck E. Cheese juke. That's a word
[19148.32s -> 19152.80s]  I don't know how that's a sentence no one has you ever with that's a fucking up my brain
[19153.44s -> 19159.34s]  Chuck E. Cheese got a juke. What that's not even that statement is not making sense
[19160.62s -> 19178.60s]  They're punting it. All right, they're actually gonna punt it. What if they fake it though, you're gonna fake it
[19178.60s -> 19184.59s]  It's a fake pun. They watched me do it like ten times in a row. It worked. Oh
[19187.78s -> 19189.30s]  Can you do it?
[19189.30s -> 19209.50s]  Yeah, I almost had it. All right. This is my last possession. I'm going for it
[19209.50s -> 19215.24s]  Let's see if I can get 14 points tie the game and then everybody runs off the field
[19215.54s -> 19221.50s]  The New England Patriots have tied it up at 14
[19221.50s -> 19231.03s]  We all run into the clubhouse even with the timer still going Chuck E. Cheese is spamming links ban him
[19231.67s -> 19241.77s]  That link Chuck E. Cheese
[19242.89s -> 19254.77s]  We do. Oh shit. Yeah, you actually did get it. I thought people were just messing around
[19254.77s -> 19284.18s]  I saw like the path one the fake link or does that actually happen? It's got a delay of game. Oh god
[19284.18s -> 19294.42s]  Damn it. All right. No, all right. Stop. I'm done deep outs. Let's go. Why would I fake that?
[19295.70s -> 19306.12s]  This what?
[19306.44s -> 19310.76s]  Isn't this what um, Eli Manning's team did to the Patriots that one year
[19311.28s -> 19316.12s]  But Eli Manning just threw like five Hail Marys in a row and they like accidentally got the Super Bowl
[19316.60s -> 19321.99s]  It happened right
[19321.99s -> 19327.03s]  Eli Manning Manning just turned his back and threw the football backwards as far as he could has had on
[19330.15s -> 19338.28s]  That's all we get
[19338.28s -> 19343.85s]  points first downs
[19343.89s -> 19346.83s]  completion percentage 35 percent
[19347.03s -> 19363.60s]  None of these stats matter who won the game. None of those matters. Am I actually kicking it off? Oh, that's not good. I lose
[19364.14s -> 19366.89s]  You hear Otto
[19367.05s -> 19372.60s]  Yeah, he was just like, let me in I wanted to just get out but let me back in right now
[19405.37s -> 19410.81s]  All right, come on in no, I don't want to go in he rolls on his back and he's like, I just leave you alone
[19411.33s -> 19421.58s]  And he runs just played itself
[19430.42s -> 19435.78s]  Six already and Jermis having so much fun that the stream hasn't ended. Yes. I get to see more 3d. Oh
[19436.30s -> 19449.39s]  We tell him we tell him this is this is the last
[19449.95s -> 19457.88s]  Like five minutes string here of game until tomorrow. I love this console. I've been having a blast
[19458.46s -> 19469.49s]  All Sam's all right. Everything else I loved and we haven't even gotten to the real
[19470.09s -> 19492.83s]  Balls that I don't care almost me all time before the stream ends. Is that a game?
[19493.55s -> 19510.34s]  Go with this one Chuck E Cheese Panasonic sellout. We're gonna open tomorrow with Jurassic Park the experience
[19516.67s -> 19522.76s]  There's so many really good games left. I just didn't want to go into him hard
[19523.08s -> 19524.84s]  Today, this is the opener
[19524.84s -> 19534.46s]  We got some real shit tomorrow. We have Jurassic Park tomorrow
[19535.22s -> 19539.62s]  Possibly psychic detective that one's gonna be a real hit and already tell
[19540.52s -> 19554.09s]  Can't wait to play it
[19554.09s -> 19555.85s]  Jurassic Park
[19555.85s -> 19562.30s]  Road rash. That's right. Yeah, tomorrow's gonna be and some shitty ones, too
[19566.06s -> 19573.01s]  I don't know. What was that pass attempt failed you drop the ball. They never even did anything
[19573.49s -> 19582.02s]  You're gonna do wacky races again. I don't think we even need to
[19583.81s -> 19591.94s]  The perfect package. Why did you dive that way?
[19594.06s -> 19600.34s]  I lose I'll see you tomorrow wicked 18 was pretty fun, too. I'll tell you
[19600.90s -> 19611.14s]  Wayne couldn't even wink I'm gonna play plumbers. Don't wear ties
[19611.14s -> 19617.04s]  I don't have that but I'm not against getting it if there's no sex in it, by the way
[19617.04s -> 19619.44s]  Also, I'm not going to play sex on the 3d
[19620.86s -> 19623.89s]  There's a video game of the 3d. Oh called
[19624.79s -> 19626.09s]  sex
[19626.09s -> 19641.53s]  Thinking that was probably not streamable. I think it really is just porn. It's just porn on the 3d. Oh, which
[19641.95s -> 19644.57s]  Gotta say pretty. Oh, you really messed up here
[19645.53s -> 19648.15s]  Imagine having interactive porn
[19648.83s -> 19653.67s]  This thing would have sold to like hotcakes. It would have been on every single shelf
[19654.21s -> 19667.10s]  Instead they wanted to have John Madden football and not FMV 3d. Okay
[19668.02s -> 19686.86s]  Suck not 25 years ago. All right, that's it. I'll see you
[19687.50s -> 19694.30s]  Star Wars is fun. Everybody didn't want to give that chance. I might actually play that tomorrow
[19694.30s -> 19697.74s]  We might go to like level five. I might just skip all the plane levels
[19698.30s -> 19710.21s]  Well, yeah, I want to give this thing a rest. It's been spinning for five and a half hours
[19710.69s -> 19722.16s]  It's scaring me. You lost to the New York Jets. No, I didn't I abandoned the New York Jets game
[19722.56s -> 19733.35s]  It's a little different. We've ran away. We didn't lose. We ran now
[19733.35s -> 19741.78s]  You could say one's probably worse than the other but still didn't lose. All right. Good night everybody. See you tomorrow
[19742.46s -> 19752.50s]  We'll start with Jurassic Park. It's an exclusive by the way. Here come the credits
[19752.94s -> 19757.79s]  It was an absolute shitload of community subs today. I had a ton of fun 3d
[19757.79s -> 19758.39s]  It was a lot of fun
[19758.39s -> 19761.59s]  It's just as good as I thought it was gonna be and there's so much more that we haven't even seen
[19761.95s -> 19772.96s]  See you tomorrow. Take care guys. Here come the credits. There were a lot of subs
[19774.68s -> 19781.16s]  FTK news we'll talk about it tomorrow. I will go over all the FTK details start times
[19782.47s -> 19797.36s]  Pre white listing of people we're gonna go over that tomorrow. It's really not gonna be that complicated
[19797.72s -> 19799.72s]  It's gonna be very very streamlined
[19799.76s -> 19806.62s]  I've seen a demo of it twice by now and I need to tell you it's gonna be great
[19806.70s -> 19822.77s]  It is way more than I thought it was going to be initially. I really do. I really did what that'll be the end
[19823.29s -> 19842.73s]  Good night. Good luck to the rest of your things. You're doing today. If I say I'll give you auto
[19842.93s -> 19853.85s]  What's the auto? Hey Otto you want to say hello after the 7,000 people that were subscribed today go by
[19854.09s -> 19859.66s]  Otto here comes an auto reveal
[19860.02s -> 19868.80s]  Want something to he's looking at me like all right, let's go. I'm ready to go outside. Let's go come here

[19891.80s -> 19902.92s]  One

[19920.47s -> 19936.71s]  Radio radio controller was like on my lap, but I was just about to fall. All right guys. I will see you tomorrow
[19937.51s -> 19940.18s]  Good night
[19940.18s -> 19982.21s]  Goodbye
