[2.17s -> 7.93s]  Okay, what else do we have to finish up?
[7.93s -> 16.73s]  Hide behind the table in the camera room?
[16.73s -> 18.41s]  Uh, uh, no.
[18.41s -> 20.60s]  Why do you have a filter on?
[20.60s -> 22.20s]  Why don't I just turn the gamma down?
[22.20s -> 24.36s]  Do Breath of the Wild?
[24.36s -> 27.61s]  No, I'd rather, I don't want to start that now.
[27.61s -> 30.01s]  What can I do for the next like 30 minutes?
[30.01s -> 30.90s]  What do you think?
[30.90s -> 34.82s]  I thought, I got a couple other games.
[34.82s -> 44.94s]  Let me see, what else do I have here?
[44.94s -> 46.78s]  Five Nights at Freddy's.
[46.78s -> 52.07s]  Okay, fine.
[52.07s -> 52.71s]  I will do...
[54.70s -> 56.22s]  No, I'm not playing that.
[56.22s -> 59.50s]  I'm not playing Five Nights at Freddy's.
[59.50s -> 67.54s]  Because I'm gonna have to do Night 1 again and like that's...
[67.54s -> 70.22s]  I don't want to sit through Night 1.
[70.22s -> 78.58s]  Please, do you really want me to play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[78.58s -> 88.46s]  Five Nights at Freddy's, it's Freddy's 2.
[88.46s -> 92.22s]  Okay, so I want a poll for me to play Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[92.22s -> 97.27s]  And it has to be at least 75%.
[97.27s -> 101.06s]  And I'll do it right now.
[101.06s -> 107.46s]  What about Faith?
[107.46s -> 110.82s]  I do have Faith, but I feel like it's too late to start it.
[110.82s -> 112.41s]  I would come back and play it.
[112.41s -> 115.70s]  Five Nights at Freddy's 2, yeah.
[115.70s -> 121.83s]  I would play that next week.
[121.83s -> 125.35s]  Just because it's not Halloween anymore doesn't mean I can't play them.
[125.35s -> 134.84s]  Five Nights at Freddy's 2, it's gonna be at least 75%.
[138.02s -> 140.98s]  I don't think this is gonna win.
[140.98s -> 149.37s]  Judging by the preliminary amount here.
[149.37s -> 150.57s]  That's the best one?
[150.57s -> 152.01s]  Yeah, I think it probably is.
[152.57s -> 154.54s]  Let me see if I can help you guys.
[155.74s -> 156.78s]  Vote for it.
[156.78s -> 157.82s]  Let's make it happen.
[157.82s -> 159.26s]  I want to see 75%.
[165.66s -> 167.34s]  I'm not sure it's even gonna get there.
[167.34s -> 169.45s]  What was the other one?
[169.45s -> 171.14s]  Hold on.
[171.14s -> 173.54s]  I swear I had another couple of games that I wanted to do.
[176.73s -> 185.99s]  I don't think it's gonna make it.
[185.99s -> 187.27s]  He wants to play it so bad.
[188.87s -> 191.03s]  I have like the other Dread X Collection stuff.
[191.59s -> 192.60s]  Let's do that.
[192.60s -> 194.12s]  What about Dread X Collection 5?
[194.12s -> 196.60s]  I'll just play a couple of random things.
[196.60s -> 197.48s]  Yeah, you're not gonna make it.
[197.48s -> 205.18s]  I'm doing Dread X Collection 5.
[205.18s -> 214.47s]  You guys are just not gonna make it.
[214.47s -> 215.83s]  Yeah, I said 75%.
[215.83s -> 216.63s]  You didn't get there.
[216.63s -> 224.95s]  Okay, let me capture it.
[230.10s -> 231.94s]  Video resolution, that's fine.
[231.94s -> 232.66s]  That's fine.
[232.66s -> 233.62s]  Field of view is fine.
[234.26s -> 235.58s]  This is fine.
[237.50s -> 241.58s]  Okay, story mode on this?
[241.58s -> 246.06s]  Interesting.
[246.06s -> 252.38s]  This is number five.
[254.94s -> 255.58s]  Story mode.
[266.39s -> 267.59s]  Strangle man's hunt.
[268.07s -> 285.53s]  Thousand, the place where your party is out of this world.
[285.53s -> 288.15s]  Locals are celebrating Hanas.
[288.95s -> 292.15s]  A nightless night and midsummer said to hold magical power.
[292.15s -> 293.43s]  A ritual must be completed.
[295.83s -> 297.91s]  The pain whispers in an infamous art gallery
[297.91s -> 299.83s]  where mysterious disappearances have occurred.
[299.83s -> 303.77s]  The book of blood?
[307.21s -> 309.83s]  Kareo.
[309.83s -> 311.19s]  A late night of karaoke.
[311.19s -> 312.47s]  A wrong turn singing.
[312.47s -> 313.91s]  Where did the train station come from?
[313.91s -> 316.14s]  Where does it go?
[316.14s -> 317.02s]  Rotten stigma.
[318.90s -> 320.86s]  Spirit guardian.
[320.86s -> 321.74s]  We never left.
[323.00s -> 324.95s]  Mystige.
[324.95s -> 327.56s]  Resver- there's a lot in this one.
[327.56s -> 328.76s]  Beyond the curtain.
[328.76s -> 333.96s]  All right, what's a good one?
[333.96s -> 335.40s]  This is collection five.
[335.40s -> 338.78s]  This one's so good.
[339.50s -> 342.30s]  Wait, what?
[342.30s -> 354.54s]  I need to get unlocked.
[358.28s -> 359.08s]  Error.
[359.08s -> 362.28s]  Please assemble band before musical performance.
[363.08s -> 364.66s]  Okay.
[376.41s -> 381.72s]  Assemble band?
[394.30s -> 395.42s]  Is every single door stuck?
[396.30s -> 399.10s]  Is it going to the bathroom?
[405.48s -> 406.76s]  Gas can is piss.
[408.33s -> 410.25s]  Does that mean that there's piss in the gas can
[410.25s -> 419.59s]  or does that mean someone with my name?
[419.59s -> 420.15s]  What is this?
[420.71s -> 424.28s]  Can I read it?
[426.54s -> 432.70s]  No, better than go outside when the besides.
[432.70s -> 435.34s]  Elvin was too long a child.
[435.34s -> 438.22s]  He hadn't time to be afraid of silly bedtime stories.
[438.22s -> 440.30s]  Only babies were afraid of the strangle man.
[441.02s -> 442.79s]  Okay.
[443.43s -> 444.63s]  Oh, a present.
[445.19s -> 448.30s]  Take it back to my birthday table to open it.
[459.62s -> 469.13s]  And here we go.
[469.13s -> 472.02s]  Somebody said this is the best one.
[472.02s -> 488.22s]  We'll find out.
[488.22s -> 491.37s]  Finland, June 24th, 1888.
[491.37s -> 492.97s]  Farmhouses across the nation are preparing
[492.97s -> 495.61s]  to celebrate the midsummer Yuhannes.
[495.61s -> 497.42s]  Considered to be a magical night,
[497.42s -> 498.78s]  many younger folk participate and play
[498.78s -> 499.74s]  for rituals and fun games.
[499.74s -> 501.18s]  One of these games was called the...
[501.82s -> 508.30s]  It's a black screen.
[508.30s -> 508.86s]  Huh?
[508.86s -> 512.42s]  Why is it a black screen?
[513.14s -> 514.02s]  Hold on.
[514.02s -> 522.94s]  Why can't you see it?
[522.94s -> 527.56s]  Oh, no.
[527.56s -> 530.58s]  Weird.
[530.58s -> 531.78s]  What if I do this?
[531.78s -> 538.55s]  Is that going to do it?
[538.55s -> 549.34s]  I don't think this...
[549.34s -> 550.38s]  I can't capture this.
[550.38s -> 550.70s]  Why?
[550.70s -> 551.50s]  That's weird.
[551.50s -> 566.52s]  Can you see it?
[566.52s -> 566.76s]  No.
[568.97s -> 573.46s]  Yeah, this is with window capture on.
[573.46s -> 574.50s]  The other one was game capture.
[574.50s -> 575.78s]  Now it captured the other game.
[575.78s -> 584.34s]  What if I...
[584.34s -> 590.06s]  Hold on.
[590.06s -> 591.10s]  That was very strange.
[591.82s -> 593.26s]  I cannot have it in full screen.
[593.26s -> 599.35s]  So it has to be in a window.
[599.35s -> 599.91s]  Okay.
[599.91s -> 603.18s]  That's fine.
[603.18s -> 611.58s]  What the fuck is this?
[611.58s -> 613.58s]  I know it's hard.
[613.58s -> 614.62s]  Dude, what?
[614.62s -> 615.42s]  What the hell?
[615.42s -> 625.27s]  You can't see it.
[625.27s -> 626.31s]  You can't see it anymore.
[626.87s -> 644.70s]  Dude, what?
[644.70s -> 645.10s]  Okay.
[645.10s -> 646.78s]  Now the game capture works.
[646.78s -> 652.49s]  I'm going to keep it on this, I guess.
[652.49s -> 660.70s]  Let's turn off the window capture.
[660.70s -> 664.54s]  You were the one to blame last year for talking to others.
[664.54s -> 667.10s]  You were just jealous.
[667.10s -> 669.98s]  Don't let others blame you.
[669.98s -> 672.55s]  Try the ritual I told you about.
[672.55s -> 673.91s]  Why don't you try that thing I told you about?
[673.91s -> 675.19s]  Seven flowers down the well.
[678.46s -> 680.94s]  I don't believe in these things, but that's how I met your mother.
[683.50s -> 685.42s]  She's still alive to see what kind of a coward you become.
[685.42s -> 686.78s]  I can't imagine how hurt she would be.
[688.14s -> 689.90s]  No, don't even remind me you look like me.
[707.22s -> 711.78s]  Drop seven flowers into the well and you will see the reflection of your future love.
[712.42s -> 715.03s]  Though anyone loving you here seems impossible.
[715.83s -> 717.42s]  Okay.
[726.74s -> 733.83s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[733.83s -> 734.15s]  What?
[734.71s -> 745.77s]  What the fuck?
[745.77s -> 747.21s]  Get the fuck off.
[748.65s -> 749.69s]  What happened last year?
[749.69s -> 751.13s]  And stay out of everyone's way.
[755.24s -> 755.88s]  Hannah's is here.
[755.88s -> 757.32s]  I hope you remember what happened last year.
[757.32s -> 758.28s]  Stay out of everyone's way.
[762.58s -> 769.78s]  The kids are drinking on the roof so the adults don't notice.
[769.78s -> 771.22s]  You get the feeling they're planning something.
[774.60s -> 775.72s]  I'm getting somebody pissing on me.
[775.72s -> 776.68s]  I just got pissed on.
[777.88s -> 779.24s]  I just got somebody peed on me.
[779.24s -> 779.74s]  Okay.
[782.39s -> 782.95s]  Okay.
[782.95s -> 783.99s]  That was interesting.
[800.60s -> 802.52s]  People tend to whip themselves with it.
[802.52s -> 805.16s]  Vita, when in sauna, helps you clean your body.
[808.07s -> 808.87s]  Hey, this is not a flower.
[817.38s -> 817.88s]  You!
[821.14s -> 822.74s]  That costume is even better than last year's.
[823.62s -> 824.66s]  Can't wait to see how the little...
[827.64s -> 828.68s]  It's mommy time?
[831.70s -> 832.82s]  Why you didn't run into me?
[833.54s -> 839.54s]  Run up the FOV.
[840.34s -> 840.98s]  Dude, can I?
[841.78s -> 842.65s]  I can't.
[850.76s -> 852.52s]  Celebrate a good harvest.
[852.52s -> 855.00s]  Dancing around the maypole is said to ensure fertility.
[866.38s -> 870.06s]  Finland, land of stoic people where every man and woman fends for themselves.
[870.70s -> 872.94s]  Children learn from a young age to never show their true feelings.
[872.94s -> 874.30s]  Being different means to be shunned.
[874.94s -> 876.06s]  You had to learn it the hard way.
[876.78s -> 879.99s]  Okay, I need to find flowers.
[887.22s -> 887.94s]  Am I dying?
[893.32s -> 894.60s]  Guys, I think I'm dying.
[895.16s -> 896.36s]  Is there a heel?
[912.25s -> 912.81s]  It's...
[912.81s -> 913.77s]  That pattern's weird.
[914.33s -> 921.21s]  I forgot what it means to be true.
[922.25s -> 922.81s]  Is there a heel?
[924.17s -> 948.82s]  There has to be a heel somewhere, right?
[949.46s -> 962.73s]  Hey, look at how fucked up this pattern is.
[963.53s -> 964.03s]  One...
[965.14s -> 965.64s]  One...
[965.94s -> 970.26s]  You didn't even make it through that.
[970.26s -> 970.90s]  That's bullshit.
[970.90s -> 971.46s]  They...
[971.46s -> 972.26s]  That didn't make it through.
[974.07s -> 975.51s]  Okay, so it's one, two...
[975.51s -> 977.03s]  When we go, like...
[977.03s -> 977.53s]  Um...
[978.07s -> 986.43s]  Three more?
[987.61s -> 989.59s]  You can feel it inside you, the true meaning.
[1005.74s -> 1006.86s]  No field work.
[1007.74s -> 1010.27s]  Okay.
[1013.66s -> 1014.16s]  Eh.
[1014.86s -> 1021.66s]  Found this village.
[1022.22s -> 1025.42s]  He defended Finland from invading Viking forces with the help of the gods themselves.
[1026.14s -> 1027.39s]  Okay.
[1033.56s -> 1034.36s]  Get away from me.
[1036.09s -> 1037.69s]  What the fuck are you doing here?
[1037.69s -> 1038.19s]  What's that?
[1039.05s -> 1048.11s]  Okay.
[1049.29s -> 1049.93s]  Hey, everybody.
[1051.21s -> 1052.09s]  One of us is in...
[1054.01s -> 1054.81s]  Y'all know what to do.
[1054.81s -> 1056.81s]  Get the hud's faulty.
[1086.52s -> 1095.11s]  Hud's faulty.
[1103.58s -> 1104.08s]  Suffering.
[1105.02s -> 1109.03s]  Dude, don't ask me where the other two are.
[1109.83s -> 1110.55s]  I have no idea.
[1120.74s -> 1121.24s]  One more.
[1124.10s -> 1138.39s]  One more.
[1138.39s -> 1144.26s]  Where's the last one?
[1152.04s -> 1153.32s]  Ah, where's the last one?
[1154.04s -> 1211.38s]  That's it, last one.
[1212.76s -> 1213.48s]  I win.
[1224.87s -> 1226.07s]  Kill them all, my love.
[1270.50s -> 1271.00s]  Jesus.
[1272.34s -> 1296.41s]  All right, I did what you asked.
[1296.89s -> 1309.22s]  All right, I did it.
[1310.60s -> 1311.10s]  Now what?
[1325.58s -> 1326.08s]  I did it.
[1326.70s -> 1347.43s]  Stop killing people?
[1347.43s -> 1348.23s]  I thought I...
[1348.23s -> 1349.51s]  Isn't this how I beat the level?
[1350.47s -> 1360.09s]  How many people are in here?
[1360.81s -> 1361.93s]  I need to feed him.
[1364.60s -> 1365.10s]  Oh.
[1366.04s -> 1366.54s]  You...
[1367.00s -> 1368.44s]  I need to feed this guy?
[1376.92s -> 1377.64s]  No, you don't?
[1377.64s -> 1378.14s]  Oh, okay.
[1378.76s -> 1387.02s]  I don't think there's anybody left.
[1413.29s -> 1414.41s]  Is there somebody else here?
[1422.54s -> 1423.50s]  Those things?
[1423.50s -> 1432.33s]  I have to give it to those too?
[1432.97s -> 1439.38s]  I thought they were...
[1439.38s -> 1440.90s]  I thought they were on my side.
[1441.46s -> 1443.42s]  Got it.
[1461.70s -> 1464.44s]  Just one more thing to do and then we can be together.
[1465.08s -> 1466.36s]  Go and meet your father.
[1467.08s -> 1467.58s]  Okay.
[1476.57s -> 1477.77s]  I'm proud of you, my love.
[1478.57s -> 1480.09s]  There's nothing that can stop you anymore.
[1480.09s -> 1481.05s]  The world is ours.
[1481.05s -> 1482.65s]  Now go and make them all suffer.
[1483.45s -> 1484.25s]  I got a pig?
[1484.25s -> 1492.74s]  That was interesting.
[1492.74s -> 1505.05s]  That was very weird.
[1505.93s -> 1511.06s]  That was very interesting.
[1511.06s -> 1512.34s]  I don't know how to feel about it.
[1512.34s -> 1515.26s]  It was just so bizarre.
[1515.90s -> 1516.46s]  Pretty cool.
[1523.16s -> 1523.72s]  Let's see if I can...
[1523.72s -> 1526.68s]  I'm still capturing the game.
[1526.68s -> 1531.80s]  Which I don't think I am.
[1531.80s -> 1532.84s]  Which I don't think I am.
[1532.84s -> 1539.62s]  Is it still open?
[1539.62s -> 1540.42s]  Uh oh.
[1540.42s -> 1542.36s]  I think it crashed.
[1542.36s -> 1545.02s]  No, we're still here.
[1545.02s -> 1548.86s]  It was kind of weird.
[1548.86s -> 1549.50s]  There we go.
[1549.50s -> 1550.00s]  Okay.
[1550.00s -> 1555.06s]  Another page of the book.
[1555.06s -> 1556.18s]  Strangle Man.
[1556.18s -> 1557.83s]  Just a silly book.
[1557.83s -> 1564.34s]  What's another good one?
[1564.34s -> 1569.96s]  Should we do the karaoke one?
[1569.96s -> 1578.73s]  Karaoke one's good.
[1578.73s -> 1592.89s]  All right, I need another present.
[1592.89s -> 1593.78s]  Error.
[1593.78s -> 1597.22s]  Please assemble band before musical performance.
[1597.22s -> 1602.31s]  I'm gonna play Roblox.
[1602.31s -> 1606.22s]  I'll play Roblox on your birthday.
[1606.22s -> 1610.49s]  Okay.
[1610.49s -> 1611.13s]  Next year.
[1611.13s -> 1614.97s]  Oh, here's a page.
[1614.97s -> 1622.22s]  Give me a present.
[1622.22s -> 1627.13s]  The 10th has been circled.
[1627.13s -> 1631.16s]  10th of October.
[1631.16s -> 1632.68s]  Uh, I'm not reading all that.
[1632.68s -> 1650.87s]  Present is the next present.
[1650.87s -> 1661.83s]  I missed it.
[1661.83s -> 1669.35s]  Turn the light on and off.
[1669.35s -> 1700.78s]  What happened?
[1700.78s -> 1701.50s]  Thank you.
[1701.50s -> 1708.15s]  All right, I'll do the karaoke one.
[1708.15s -> 1712.70s]  I hope it captures.
[1712.70s -> 1727.11s]  I think I have to do the window again.
[1727.11s -> 1729.82s]  This video game contains flashes of light.
[1729.82s -> 1731.02s]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[1731.02s -> 1731.58s]  Okay.
[1731.58s -> 1741.13s]  Capture the window.
[1741.13s -> 1744.82s]  That's so weird how that happens.
[1744.82s -> 1746.02s]  I think it's because it's a compilation
[1746.02s -> 1756.41s]  and it's loading a different game.
[1756.41s -> 1757.13s]  There.
[1757.13s -> 1759.19s]  Okay, so that should do it.
[1759.19s -> 1770.20s]  Why is this on the screen?
[1770.20s -> 1777.43s]  Um, what's going on?
[1777.43s -> 1781.51s]  I think it crashed.
[1781.51s -> 1781.99s]  Shit.
[1781.99s -> 1793.99s]  What?
[1793.99s -> 1795.78s]  Uh, yeah, it's crashed.
[1795.78s -> 1796.26s]  Shit.
[1796.26s -> 1797.30s]  Come on, really?
[1797.30s -> 1807.66s]  Can I reload it?
[1807.66s -> 1809.29s]  Let me try reloading it.
[1809.29s -> 1826.86s]  I'll try one more time.
[1826.86s -> 1838.95s]  Okay, new game.
[1838.95s -> 1843.40s]  I'm just gonna do new game.
[1843.40s -> 1845.16s]  You don't see it, but that's all right.
[1845.16s -> 1848.95s]  I'm just trying to get into the game first.
[1848.95s -> 1850.07s]  Like right here.
[1850.07s -> 1855.86s]  Oh, this is fucked up.
[1855.86s -> 1862.60s]  This is very bizarre.
[1862.60s -> 1863.75s]  Okay.
[1863.75s -> 1865.27s]  Can you see it now?
[1865.27s -> 1876.42s]  I think you can see it now.
[1876.42s -> 1878.98s]  Hey, it's loud as all hell.
[1878.98s -> 1880.02s]  Turn that down.
[1880.02s -> 1881.82s]  Let's try it.
[1881.82s -> 1887.43s]  It looks busy.
[1887.43s -> 1889.50s]  Broken.
[1889.50s -> 1912.22s]  I guess it's a karaoke machine.
[1912.22s -> 1915.56s]  I have no interest in talking to this guy.
[1915.56s -> 1916.92s]  One shot, please.
[1916.92s -> 1917.86s]  Okay.
[1917.94s -> 1918.58s]  Take it.
[1918.58s -> 1921.70s]  Jasper and Lace.
[1921.70s -> 1923.54s]  I'm Jasper, the guy by the stage is Lace.
[1923.54s -> 1927.30s]  And before you ask, yes, we're identical twins.
[1927.30s -> 1928.10s]  Where's the toilet?
[1928.10s -> 1928.50s]  It's broken.
[1928.50s -> 1929.78s]  What if I have to go?
[1929.78s -> 1931.22s]  This is why we only sell shots.
[1931.22s -> 1932.98s]  You drank too much before you came here.
[1933.62s -> 1936.71s]  There's a toilet in the back.
[1937.27s -> 1938.68s]  Okay, thanks.
[1938.68s -> 1944.57s]  It's a headlamp.
[1944.57s -> 1944.89s]  Okay.
[1948.52s -> 1949.00s]  No problem.
[1949.00s -> 1950.68s]  Code for the door is 145.
[1950.68s -> 1952.04s]  All right, so did I get it?
[1954.86s -> 1955.26s]  Thank you.
[1955.90s -> 1969.64s]  Lights seem to be working.
[1969.64s -> 1971.24s]  I'll keep the headlamp off for now.
[1971.24s -> 1985.38s]  This must be Phil.
[1985.38s -> 2006.01s]  Better not wake him.
[2006.01s -> 2015.96s]  Okay, I'm in here.
[2015.96s -> 2016.68s]  What now?
[2016.68s -> 2037.32s]  Okay.
[2038.12s -> 2039.32s]  That was beautiful.
[2039.32s -> 2059.45s]  A rail lever?
[2059.45s -> 2061.27s]  One of seven.
[2061.27s -> 2066.22s]  Rail lever?
[2084.62s -> 2085.34s]  What's happening?
[2087.38s -> 2088.18s]  What is that?
[2088.18s -> 2088.90s]  What is that?
[2088.90s -> 2122.86s]  Is this a granny-like?
[2122.86s -> 2123.82s]  No, I don't think so.
[2123.82s -> 2124.94s]  This is not a granny-like.
[2124.94s -> 2156.22s]  Okay.
[2156.22s -> 2157.42s]  How do I move?
[2157.42s -> 2166.01s]  How do I get out of here?
[2190.82s -> 2192.10s]  I was waiting for it.
[2193.14s -> 2199.99s]  I was like, I thought it was going to come this way.
[2199.99s -> 2200.86s]  Nope.
[2200.86s -> 2201.82s]  Right into the ground.
[2201.82s -> 2242.25s]  There's a bed down here.
[2257.29s -> 2257.93s]  Yeah.
[2257.93s -> 2258.57s]  What else?
[2258.57s -> 2259.61s]  What else is going on?
[2259.61s -> 2285.26s]  What does that mean?
[2285.34s -> 2302.73s]  You should have just pissed in the street.
[2302.73s -> 2351.43s]  Oh, you're shooting at me.
[2351.43s -> 2352.71s]  You're shooting a gun at me.
[2352.71s -> 2353.67s]  You're shooting a gun at me.
[2353.67s -> 2355.03s]  You have a gun and you're shooting it.
[2355.03s -> 2356.42s]  Where am I?
[2356.42s -> 2363.58s]  My god.
[2363.58s -> 2364.70s]  Okay, I'm alive.
[2364.70s -> 2379.58s]  Hello.
[2379.58s -> 2381.70s]  Hello.
[2381.70s -> 2384.46s]  I'm sorry I scared you.
[2385.42s -> 2386.22s]  I'm not used to visitors.
[2386.22s -> 2387.42s]  You're not supposed to be up there.
[2387.42s -> 2388.78s]  That area is shut off.
[2388.78s -> 2391.16s]  I'm up here by mistake.
[2391.16s -> 2392.76s]  Well, you better get out of there.
[2392.76s -> 2393.80s]  There's a lady with a gun.
[2393.80s -> 2394.60s]  A lady with a gun?
[2394.60s -> 2395.08s]  Yeah.
[2395.08s -> 2396.50s]  I don't have time for this.
[2396.50s -> 2396.98s]  You're all out.
[2396.98s -> 2397.46s]  You're all the same.
[2397.46s -> 2398.18s]  You tunnel people.
[2398.18s -> 2400.89s]  You're all out of your goddamn minds.
[2400.89s -> 2401.37s]  Tell you what.
[2401.37s -> 2404.49s]  Go back up and out the air vent.
[2404.57s -> 2407.21s]  Enter the code 789 by the gate to the tunnels.
[2407.21s -> 2408.73s]  Take the right tunnel, not the left one.
[2410.95s -> 2412.41s]  Okay.
[2412.41s -> 2414.65s]  Take the right one, not the left one.
[2414.65s -> 2415.91s]  789.
[2415.91s -> 2417.19s]  Gate to the tunnels.
[2417.19s -> 2425.85s]  I get that a lot from you people.
[2425.85s -> 2426.89s]  Run along now.
[2426.89s -> 2429.22s]  All right.
[2429.22s -> 2430.58s]  789.
[2430.58s -> 2436.73s]  It's the gate.
[2436.73s -> 2437.45s]  Where is that?
[2437.45s -> 2449.80s]  Can I get back up here?
[2449.80s -> 2452.52s]  How do I get out of here?
[2452.52s -> 2459.62s]  Is there a different way?
[2459.62s -> 2464.81s]  I need to crouch.
[2464.81s -> 2468.18s]  This is a jump at the...
[2468.18s -> 2468.58s]  I don't know.
[2468.58s -> 2469.38s]  Let's try that again.
[2469.38s -> 2478.31s]  Can I just...
[2478.31s -> 2479.19s]  No, I can't.
[2479.19s -> 2480.47s]  Oh, I can.
[2480.47s -> 2503.75s]  Door's locked.
[2503.75s -> 2504.95s]  Wait, what did that just open?
[2504.95s -> 2508.89s]  789.
[2508.89s -> 2509.85s]  What did that just do?
[2509.93s -> 2516.79s]  What did it do?
[2516.79s -> 2526.71s]  The gate right next to you opened.
[2526.71s -> 2527.27s]  This...
[2527.27s -> 2527.59s]  I didn't...
[2527.59s -> 2528.47s]  I wasn't even looking.
[2528.47s -> 2550.09s]  I didn't know why he didn't want me to go into the left tunnel.
[2550.09s -> 2551.21s]  He said, don't go there.
[2551.21s -> 2552.33s]  Why would I go into the left tunnel?
[2552.33s -> 2554.33s]  What do you mean I want to find out why
[2554.33s -> 2558.70s]  he wanted me not to go down the left tunnel?
[2558.70s -> 2560.22s]  That's not how this works.
[2560.22s -> 2564.10s]  I really need to figure out why he didn't want me to go down there.
[2564.10s -> 2571.08s]  No, you just listen, man.
[2571.08s -> 2572.20s]  I have a gun.
[2601.96s -> 2602.84s]  I've got a weapon now.
[2638.34s -> 2638.82s]  Sorry.
[2639.54s -> 2659.16s]  Hey.
[2660.92s -> 2661.32s]  Five.
[2681.90s -> 2688.22s]  Five, eight.
[2688.22s -> 2688.86s]  Five, eight.
[2692.30s -> 2693.02s]  Five, eight.
[2693.50s -> 2697.45s]  What else can I do?
[2697.45s -> 2698.41s]  Is there anything else to see?
[2698.41s -> 2700.57s]  I can't see anything.
[2700.57s -> 2701.37s]  Five, eight.
[2701.37s -> 2706.87s]  Five, eight, one.
[2708.57s -> 2712.86s]  Five, eight, one.
[2712.86s -> 2713.90s]  Five, eight, one.
[2713.90s -> 2725.38s]  I definitely need these.
[2725.38s -> 2738.20s]  That song is terrifying.
[2761.34s -> 2764.47s]  Where?
[2764.47s -> 2765.03s]  Jesus.
[2801.22s -> 2802.18s]  You're going to stand up, aren't you?
[2806.76s -> 2807.00s]  No.
[2807.88s -> 2808.68s]  Fuck.
[2808.68s -> 2821.50s]  How far away am I?
[2821.50s -> 2831.94s]  It's not that far.
[2831.94s -> 2840.71s]  Okay, go down the other tunnel.
[2840.71s -> 2844.14s]  Okay, right.
[2844.14s -> 2844.70s]  Wait, what?
[2844.70s -> 2849.32s]  Yeah, let's go.
[2849.32s -> 2850.84s]  Now I get what I'm supposed to be doing.
[2850.84s -> 2856.89s]  Speed run time.
[2856.89s -> 2857.61s]  Five, eight, one.
[2857.61s -> 2858.17s]  And I can just walk.
[2858.17s -> 2859.21s]  I can run through this.
[2859.21s -> 2866.42s]  Five, eight, one.
[2886.63s -> 2887.59s]  I think I have to do it.
[2887.59s -> 2924.25s]  Let's go.
[2924.25s -> 2934.57s]  This is pretty scary.
[2934.57s -> 2934.89s]  It is.
[2935.69s -> 2936.73s]  It's just off-putting.
[2936.73s -> 2944.42s]  Back where I was.
[2944.42s -> 2946.42s]  I have not been hit yet, so that's good.
[2946.42s -> 2960.41s]  Okay, that's a lot of shots.
[2960.41s -> 2989.83s]  Okay, don't die here.
[2989.83s -> 2990.39s]  Jesus.
[3010.31s -> 3011.43s]  Hey, where?
[3011.43s -> 3012.31s]  Where are you?
[3012.31s -> 3013.98s]  I don't know where they are.
[3013.98s -> 3014.54s]  Where?
[3014.54s -> 3030.04s]  Okay, there's another code right here.
[3030.04s -> 3061.96s]  Where are you?
[3061.96s -> 3062.68s]  Ah!
[3062.68s -> 3085.00s]  Wait, what?
[3085.00s -> 3095.91s]  This is just back to where I was.
[3095.91s -> 3113.03s]  Did I miss something?
[3143.32s -> 3156.65s]  I'm just going back down here.
[3156.65s -> 3157.69s]  Number four guy.
[3157.69s -> 3159.45s]  Now he's just number three, six, seven.
[3159.45s -> 3160.97s]  Oh, shit.
[3160.97s -> 3162.09s]  Okay, let's go.
[3162.49s -> 3181.11s]  Three, six, seven.
[3181.11s -> 3185.99s]  Wait, that's not the right one.
[3185.99s -> 3186.71s]  Wait.
[3186.71s -> 3188.36s]  Where was that door?
[3188.36s -> 3189.32s]  It was back here.
[3189.32s -> 3199.27s]  Where was that shit?
[3199.27s -> 3199.99s]  There it is.
[3199.99s -> 3209.05s]  Where is that?
[3209.05s -> 3214.87s]  Where was that?
[3214.87s -> 3238.58s]  Where you just were?
[3238.58s -> 3239.14s]  Shit, okay.
[3292.41s -> 3293.37s]  What the fuck?
[3293.37s -> 3299.43s]  Excuse me, where am I?
[3299.43s -> 3301.59s]  You're in Potogzow.
[3301.59s -> 3302.98s]  Who are you?
[3302.98s -> 3306.68s]  I'm Stig, the tram operator.
[3306.68s -> 3308.81s]  Where does the tram go?
[3308.81s -> 3309.93s]  Down the mountain, into the valley.
[3309.93s -> 3311.05s]  Can you see all the...
[3311.05s -> 3312.33s]  Can you see the lit window?
[3312.33s -> 3312.89s]  The red light?
[3312.89s -> 3314.01s]  It's been blinking all night.
[3314.01s -> 3316.02s]  It's irritating.
[3316.02s -> 3316.98s]  The blinking doesn't...
[3316.98s -> 3318.74s]  She have anything better to do.
[3318.74s -> 3321.75s]  Who is she?
[3321.75s -> 3322.90s]  She's a nobody.
[3322.90s -> 3324.68s]  If she were to disappear,
[3324.68s -> 3325.72s]  I don't think anyone would care.
[3326.36s -> 3329.54s]  How do I get to her?
[3329.54s -> 3330.02s]  With the tram.
[3330.02s -> 3331.38s]  But we only operate the tram at night
[3331.38s -> 3332.42s]  during special occasions,
[3332.42s -> 3334.74s]  such as the famous Potogzow
[3335.70s -> 3337.22s]  Orienteering Gathering.
[3337.78s -> 3340.82s]  What if I need to use it?
[3340.82s -> 3342.25s]  Wait till morning.
[3342.81s -> 3346.02s]  Then you'll need the approval of Maria, my manager.
[3346.58s -> 3348.12s]  How do I find Maria?
[3348.76s -> 3351.34s]  Walk along the train tracks
[3351.34s -> 3352.06s]  and into the forest.
[3352.06s -> 3353.18s]  You'll find her eventually.
[3353.18s -> 3353.58s]  Okay.
[3353.58s -> 3354.14s]  Am I dead?
[3356.02s -> 3356.74s]  I'm not a mortician.
[3356.74s -> 3357.70s]  I'm a tram operator.
[3359.77s -> 3360.49s]  Okay.
[3360.49s -> 3362.02s]  This was a dream.
[3362.02s -> 3363.38s]  We'd probably be somewhere else
[3363.38s -> 3364.66s]  than in Potogzow.
[3365.30s -> 3366.86s]  What choice do I have?
[3366.86s -> 3367.50s]  I like it.
[3367.50s -> 3368.06s]  Okay.
[3368.06s -> 3369.26s]  So follow the train tracks.
[3369.82s -> 3376.89s]  I have full health.
[3376.89s -> 3391.91s]  To ride, talk to tram operator.
[3401.35s -> 3402.71s]  Walk along the train tracks.
[3403.27s -> 3403.91s]  Where are they?
[3405.45s -> 3406.41s]  Down here?
[3406.41s -> 3422.09s]  I am technically...
[3422.65s -> 3423.69s]  Technically correct.
[3423.69s -> 3436.02s]  That was technically correct.
[3436.02s -> 3437.46s]  Run down the tracks.
[3437.46s -> 3441.48s]  How am I supposed to do that?
[3441.48s -> 3463.80s]  Did I just overshoot it?
[3463.80s -> 3464.12s]  Huh?
[3470.46s -> 3471.50s]  That wasn't the tracks.
[3472.46s -> 3474.22s]  That's the tracks.
[3474.22s -> 3481.53s]  That was the tracks.
[3481.53s -> 3482.25s]  Okay.
[3482.25s -> 3486.09s]  I guess not.
[3486.09s -> 3487.93s]  You were just on the tracks.
[3487.93s -> 3490.81s]  You mean like up here?
[3494.95s -> 3496.23s]  I thought this is the train.
[3496.23s -> 3498.78s]  Train tracks, not tram tracks.
[3498.78s -> 3507.64s]  Those aren't train tracks.
[3507.64s -> 3508.68s]  That's a tram track.
[3514.62s -> 3516.94s]  Fucking tram track in front of your eyes.
[3523.78s -> 3526.02s]  I thought it was like to go on the train track.
[3526.74s -> 3528.10s]  I'm the tram operator.
[3528.10s -> 3530.10s]  Get on the train tram tracks.
[3530.10s -> 3556.01s]  Okay.
[3556.01s -> 3580.62s]  Well, was I supposed to do that?
[3581.18s -> 3602.79s]  Oh, they have writing shit.
[3602.79s -> 3603.19s]  Okay.
[3603.19s -> 3603.75s]  What does it say?
[3614.25s -> 3616.01s]  Nine, four...
[3624.07s -> 3629.66s]  Nine, four, six?
[3629.66s -> 3631.75s]  There's one more.
[3639.96s -> 3641.64s]  Nine something four six three.
[3651.94s -> 3657.45s]  Nine, four six three.
[3665.05s -> 3668.09s]  Nine, two, four, six, three.
[3668.09s -> 3669.90s]  Two, four, six, three.
[3671.91s -> 3672.63s]  Okay.
[3672.63s -> 3696.06s]  What is the camera covering?
[3696.06s -> 3697.18s]  Just the amount of bullets I have.
[3697.18s -> 3698.22s]  It's 57.
[3698.22s -> 3707.34s]  Jesus.
[3733.34s -> 3734.22s]  Oops.
[3734.22s -> 3734.54s]  Okay.
[3734.54s -> 3735.82s]  I think it automatically did it.
[3757.80s -> 3758.30s]  Oh.
[3787.54s -> 3788.04s]  Oh.
[3788.42s -> 3790.98s]  What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what.
[3791.86s -> 3794.12s]  Oh my fucking God.
[3794.12s -> 3795.00s]  There's so many of them.
[3796.30s -> 3797.50s]  I...
[3797.50s -> 3798.54s]  It's so disorienting.
[3799.26s -> 3809.46s]  Okay.
[3809.46s -> 3814.01s]  Am I right?
[3814.01s -> 3821.37s]  I woke up early this morning trying to get the blood out of my hair.
[3825.18s -> 3826.38s]  Can I get on there?
[3826.38s -> 3849.74s]  This is long.
[3849.74s -> 3851.67s]  I didn't think it was gonna be this long.
[3852.39s -> 3853.75s]  We're probably near the end.
[3853.75s -> 3861.74s]  Okay.
[3861.74s -> 3874.22s]  Am I hitting golf balls or something?
[3874.22s -> 3881.35s]  How do I talk to this person?
[3881.35s -> 3903.10s]  I don't think I can get up here.
[3903.10s -> 3903.58s]  The ladder?
[3903.58s -> 3909.75s]  I can't climb the ladder.
[3909.75s -> 3921.59s]  Like, I can't get up here.
[3921.59s -> 3923.14s]  Maria?
[3923.14s -> 3924.66s]  I need to ride the tram.
[3924.66s -> 3927.05s]  Why are you telling me?
[3927.05s -> 3928.41s]  Did Stieg send you here?
[3928.41s -> 3928.65s]  Yes.
[3928.65s -> 3929.85s]  He said you're the manager.
[3929.85s -> 3932.28s]  Oh, that's funny.
[3932.28s -> 3933.18s]  I'm not his manager.
[3933.18s -> 3933.90s]  We don't work together.
[3933.90s -> 3937.78s]  Stieg is my orienteering buddy.
[3937.78s -> 3940.58s]  Bring me back some of my golf balls from the forest and I'll let you.
[3940.58s -> 3945.24s]  Find your own way back to the tram then.
[3945.24s -> 3945.48s]  All right.
[3945.48s -> 3947.00s]  I'll get you golf balls.
[3947.00s -> 3950.46s]  That's your handicap.
[3950.46s -> 3952.86s]  Four, five, 45.
[3952.86s -> 3955.50s]  What are you shooting at?
[3955.50s -> 3957.80s]  Okay.
[3957.80s -> 3960.04s]  So I gotta go get your golf balls.
[3960.04s -> 3995.88s]  I think I should have found one by now.
[3995.88s -> 4004.57s]  What is this?
[4004.57s -> 4030.49s]  Okay.
[4030.49s -> 4032.33s]  Five, five, five, eight.
[4036.71s -> 4037.59s]  I probably shouldn't have done that.
[4039.99s -> 4041.69s]  I didn't talk.
[4042.74s -> 4043.54s]  What?
[4043.54s -> 4045.62s]  The train tunnel entrance has a new code.
[4045.62s -> 4046.98s]  Five, five, five, eight.
[4052.90s -> 4053.70s]  I don't know what I just did.
[4066.52s -> 4067.88s]  They're pointing at this.
[4067.88s -> 4072.68s]  Can I close it?
[4076.23s -> 4077.83s]  Five, five, five, eight.
[4080.46s -> 4082.38s]  Train tunnel entrance has a new code.
[4100.82s -> 4109.77s]  I woke up early this morning.
[4121.46s -> 4122.50s]  What's the twist here?
[4122.50s -> 4122.74s]  Right?
[4122.74s -> 4124.10s]  There's gotta be some twist.
[4124.10s -> 4129.29s]  There's no way it's just this.
[4129.29s -> 4131.21s]  What happened to being at a karaoke bar?
[4131.21s -> 4154.58s]  I forgot that even happened.
[4154.58s -> 4178.44s]  Here it comes.
[4178.44s -> 4179.16s]  What the fuck?
[4180.12s -> 4180.92s]  Who's shooting?
[4180.92s -> 4181.16s]  Where?
[4181.16s -> 4181.56s]  From where?
[4211.77s -> 4212.17s]  Should have hit.
[4226.52s -> 4227.16s]  Shut up.
[4227.16s -> 4227.88s]  Where are you shooting?
[4227.88s -> 4229.08s]  Oh my goodness.
[4309.51s -> 4310.31s]  Come on.
[4318.36s -> 4319.56s]  I can't even see.
[4319.56s -> 4337.83s]  Okay.
[4338.23s -> 4339.75s]  Don't walk off the edge.
[4339.75s -> 4347.78s]  What does that do for us?
[4347.78s -> 4353.18s]  Shoot like a grandma.
[4353.18s -> 4353.50s]  Sorry.
[4353.50s -> 4355.26s]  This is not a granny like.
[4359.32s -> 4367.98s]  What am I supposed to do?
[4367.98s -> 4372.58s]  I was...
[4415.74s -> 4416.54s]  Bonzi buddy.
[4431.53s -> 4431.77s]  Okay.
[4431.77s -> 4433.53s]  So now I can use the train.
[4433.53s -> 4434.94s]  Sorry.
[4434.94s -> 4435.74s]  Tram.
[4435.74s -> 4437.80s]  How do I use the tram?
[4437.80s -> 4443.10s]  Hello?
[4443.10s -> 4447.37s]  Did I turn it on?
[4447.37s -> 4450.66s]  Okay.
[4450.66s -> 4451.38s]  I have this guy.
[4454.26s -> 4456.82s]  R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[4456.82s -> 4484.79s]  So what are we doing?
[4498.66s -> 4587.37s]  Like.
[4587.37s -> 4589.85s]  I woke up early.
[4589.85s -> 4590.33s]  Here it comes.
[4590.33s -> 4590.73s]  All right.
[4601.91s -> 4608.42s]  I don't need bullets.
[4608.42s -> 4614.52s]  There's no bullets in this gun.
[4614.52s -> 4644.87s]  This is Lace.
[4644.87s -> 4646.15s]  The other one's Jasper.
[4646.15s -> 4647.43s]  They jumped me in the forest.
[4647.43s -> 4648.55s]  Put me in an old freezer.
[4648.55s -> 4650.07s]  Kept me in a fucking cage.
[4650.07s -> 4652.07s]  I'd be dead if it weren't for you.
[4652.07s -> 4653.58s]  Thanks for getting me out.
[4653.58s -> 4654.86s]  Sorry for all the blood.
[4654.86s -> 4657.96s]  You're welcome.
[4658.60s -> 4659.64s]  I need to get back home.
[4659.64s -> 4660.76s]  Do you live in Texas?
[4660.76s -> 4661.40s]  We're in Texas?
[4661.40s -> 4663.48s]  No, I'm from Ptokso.
[4663.48s -> 4664.68s]  You probably haven't heard of it.
[4664.68s -> 4666.20s]  It's a small little village in the forest.
[4666.76s -> 4668.62s]  Maybe you've heard of the Ptokso
[4668.62s -> 4670.22s]  Orienteering Gathering.
[4670.22s -> 4672.06s]  You have a car?
[4672.06s -> 4673.74s]  Can you give me a ride?
[4673.74s -> 4693.30s]  That was weird.
[4693.30s -> 4694.26s]  Oh, here we go.
[4694.26s -> 4697.54s]  I woke up early this morning.
[4699.08s -> 4701.72s]  Trying to get the blood out of my hair.
[4703.42s -> 4706.46s]  Franking up the sound on my hi-fi.
[4707.82s -> 4709.98s]  Out the screen downstairs.
[4712.12s -> 4715.32s]  Smiling along to my memories.
[4716.38s -> 4718.14s]  Of what we've been lup to.
[4718.14s -> 4724.04s]  To my brother and I were laughing.
[4724.76s -> 4725.24s]  What else?
[4733.88s -> 4735.56s]  We know the lyrics.
[4741.16s -> 4741.96s]  What the fuck?
[4743.16s -> 4755.00s]  I don't want to sing this part.
[4755.56s -> 4770.57s]  I'm not singing this part.
[4809.54s -> 4810.02s]  That was good.
[4811.82s -> 4813.10s]  My mic just freaked out.
[4818.01s -> 4827.90s]  Is there anything else?
[4828.86s -> 4835.61s]  So they were singing karaoke about a crime they committed.
[4836.98s -> 4838.42s]  And then I went to rescue the girl.
[4838.42s -> 4839.54s]  That's crazy.
[4839.54s -> 4841.32s]  That was a good one.
[4841.56s -> 4848.87s]  That was good.
[4848.87s -> 4849.59s]  All right.
[4849.59s -> 4851.50s]  I think I'm going to call it here.
[4851.50s -> 4856.70s]  That was a fun night of games.
[4856.70s -> 4860.49s]  It's great to see Vinny and you guys, right?
[4863.80s -> 4866.60s]  The next time you see me will be on Halloween night.
[4866.60s -> 4868.98s]  Or Halloween day.
[4870.36s -> 4871.32s]  Actually, what time will it be?
[4872.18s -> 4875.27s]  I think it's going to be 12 p.m. Eastern.
[4875.27s -> 4878.23s]  I will be on Charlie's Cooking Show.
[4878.23s -> 4881.06s]  Company time.
[4881.06s -> 4882.02s]  Should be fun.
[4882.02s -> 4885.21s]  So I will not be live on this channel,
[4885.21s -> 4889.30s]  but go to Charlie's channel on Halloween.
[4889.30s -> 4890.89s]  Should be fun.
[4890.89s -> 4891.69s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[4893.06s -> 4897.38s]  And for horror games, I'm not big on granny likes.
[4897.38s -> 4898.26s]  I'm not very good at them.
[4899.32s -> 4902.60s]  I have very jumpy and I have pay attention problems.
[4904.31s -> 4907.46s]  The granny likes destroy me.
[4907.46s -> 4908.66s]  But it's still fun.
[4908.66s -> 4910.55s]  I still had a lot of fun.
[4910.55s -> 4911.43s]  It was a great night of games.
[4912.97s -> 4915.13s]  I will see you guys on Halloween.
[4915.13s -> 4919.24s]  Please go watch the critical.
[4919.24s -> 4923.16s]  Yeah, Charlie, critical.
[4923.16s -> 4924.20s]  Is Charlie live right now?
[4925.24s -> 4926.44s]  Which is Ray Charlie?
[4926.44s -> 4928.04s]  Is he live?
[4928.04s -> 4934.76s]  He's doing some YouTube stuff.
[4936.20s -> 4936.84s]  Go say hello.
[4937.40s -> 4938.74s]  So it should be a fun time.
[4939.38s -> 4940.02s]  Halloween day.
[4940.02s -> 4940.66s]  See you guys soon.
[4940.66s -> 4941.38s]  Thanks for watching.
[4943.14s -> 4944.98s]  Have a great night.
[4944.98s -> 4951.56s]  See you on the 31st.
[4951.56s -> 4953.96s]  And go say hello to Charlie.
[4953.96s -> 4958.17s]  I'm going to go take a bath.
[4958.17s -> 4959.13s]  I'm sweating.
[4959.13s -> 4960.98s]  I'll be really honest with you.
[4962.52s -> 4964.52s]  I think after about hour number four or five
[4964.52s -> 4969.02s]  after screaming like a thousand times,
[4969.02s -> 4970.86s]  I kind of ran out of gas.
[4970.86s -> 4973.74s]  I got scared so many times tonight
[4973.74s -> 4975.50s]  that I think I ran out of gas
[4975.50s -> 4976.86s]  after like hour number five and a half.
[4983.93s -> 4985.56s]  Okay.
[4985.56s -> 4987.48s]  When your body screams like that, like
[4989.96s -> 4991.64s]  it just drains you so physically.
[4991.64s -> 4993.56s]  It's so we could tell.
[4996.36s -> 4997.32s]  I wanted to stick it through
[4997.32s -> 4998.12s]  for a couple of these though
[4998.12s -> 4999.32s]  because they are really fun.
[4999.32s -> 5002.76s]  All right.
[5002.76s -> 5004.76s]  Let's say hi to Charlie.
[5005.75s -> 5006.31s]  Good night, guys.
[5006.31s -> 5007.51s]  See you on the 31st.
[5007.51s -> 5010.62s]  Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[5010.62s -> 5012.06s]  Whatever is left of it or good morning.
[5012.06s -> 5012.78s]  If you're just waking up,
[5012.78s -> 5015.67s]  it's pretty late for a lot of you.
[5015.67s -> 5017.85s]  See you soon.
[5017.85s -> 5020.81s]  Also check out grottobeasts.net
[5020.81s -> 5022.89s]  grottobeasts.com
[5022.97s -> 5026.60s]  if you are interested in grottobeasts
[5026.60s -> 5028.44s]  which is the collectible card
[5028.44s -> 5029.72s]  trading card game.
[5034.65s -> 5034.89s]  Okay.
[5034.89s -> 5036.33s]  Let me get it ready.
[5036.33s -> 5045.70s]  All right.
[5045.70s -> 5051.19s]  Go say hello to Charlie.
[5051.19s -> 5053.91s]  12 noon I believe on the 31st.
[5053.91s -> 5055.67s]  He'll probably be able to update that.
[5055.67s -> 5056.39s]  Follow his Twitter.
