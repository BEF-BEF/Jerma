[0.31s -> 12.89s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolution.
[12.89s -> 18.89s]  This is gonna be mission three called Terminus, where I have to gain access to a hotel room.
[18.89s -> 22.89s]  And well, basically the hotel. And hopefully I don't get hit by like a car.
[22.89s -> 26.19s]  Any cars driving down this road? No, there's a train.
[26.19s -> 32.19s]  But I gotta gain access to this hotel. I gotta find an arms dealer by the name of Blake.
[32.19s -> 36.56s]  Not sure what the deal is here, but I'm just gonna go in the front door.
[36.56s -> 38.95s]  Hey buddy!
[42.95s -> 43.95s]  Hmm, closed.
[47.95s -> 48.95s]  How you doing?
[54.95s -> 60.95s]  So I cannot go up there. Cannot go upstairs or else those guys are gonna shoot me.
[60.95s -> 65.77s]  So I'm gonna go this way. What is like Henry Winkle doing over here?
[65.77s -> 70.80s]  Well, I can't go in there. Staff only, okay? Staff only, I get you.
[70.80s -> 75.92s]  Is this guy part of the staff? Can I like break this guy's neck and take his outfit?
[75.92s -> 78.48s]  Probably not. Let's see.
[78.48s -> 85.86s]  Hmm, to get upstairs, I'm probably gonna need to do some interesting things here.
[85.86s -> 88.86s]  This is the restroom. This guy's coming in here actually.
[88.86s -> 92.25s]  Yeah, this guy's coming in the bathroom right now.
[92.25s -> 96.50s]  Oh my god, plunger, plunger. Can I like plunge this guy?
[96.50s -> 102.34s]  Oh god. Oh, I can like choke him out with the plunger.
[103.34s -> 106.66s]  Sick. No one's coming in here, right?
[110.15s -> 111.52s]  Get in the toilet!
[114.52s -> 116.08s]  Just shut the hell up!
[118.08s -> 119.45s]  You didn't see anything.
[120.45s -> 124.29s]  Oh my god, like this guy's gonna take like a dump.
[125.29s -> 126.29s]  Oh no, oh no.
[127.29s -> 130.29s]  Alright, don't worry. Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything.
[131.29s -> 133.49s]  Knock him out.
[133.49s -> 141.43s]  Well, so things have gone very, very smoothly in the first like five seconds.
[141.43s -> 143.43s]  I have to dump all these bodies in the toilet.
[143.43s -> 147.40s]  Can I even hide these guys in here?
[147.40s -> 151.22s]  This is gonna be three random dudes in the bathroom. Oh no.
[152.78s -> 157.70s]  Can I block the bathroom off? Oh great, okay, that's like a dumpster.
[157.70s -> 159.70s]  Alright, I need to put on that guy's bowling shirt.
[159.70s -> 161.01s]  Whatever the hell he's wearing.
[161.01s -> 166.87s]  Hopefully nobody else comes in the bathroom.
[166.87s -> 170.87s]  Dude, I clubbed that guy in his face with a dirty plunger.
[173.90s -> 174.90s]  Maybe I can put that guy in the other room.
[174.90s -> 178.90s]  Wow, this is, I almost already have minus 5,000 freaking points.
[181.74s -> 184.69s]  It's alright. No more bodies can fit in here.
[187.78s -> 188.78s]  Maybe I can stuff this guy.
[188.78s -> 190.09s]  Can I open this door?
[191.65s -> 195.65s]  I'm gonna have to very, very cautiously drag this guy back towards the toilet.
[195.65s -> 198.53s]  Oh, I'm like breaking his leg. That was so horrible.
[198.53s -> 200.53s]  Look at this, like I'm wrenching him.
[200.53s -> 204.05s]  I honestly can't do anything with this guy.
[204.05s -> 205.05s]  Hold on a second.
[205.05s -> 208.30s]  I'm gonna look out here.
[208.30s -> 212.37s]  Is there like a dumpster right here I can dump this guy in?
[212.37s -> 215.66s]  Is anyone gonna see it?
[215.66s -> 217.66s]  If anyone goes in that bathroom, damn it.
[217.66s -> 219.28s]  Oh, whatever.
[219.28s -> 221.28s]  Well, people are getting curious.
[221.28s -> 223.80s]  I can't even go in the staff room.
[223.80s -> 226.55s]  What was the point of all that?
[226.55s -> 227.55s]  I can't even like walk over here.
[227.55s -> 231.84s]  Oh, staff only.
[231.84s -> 235.60s]  Whoa, hey, hello fellas.
[235.60s -> 236.60s]  Are they gonna see me?
[236.60s -> 237.60s]  They're gonna see me if I go over here.
[237.60s -> 243.06s]  We're good.
[243.06s -> 244.06s]  We're good so far.
[244.06s -> 251.13s]  Except for the fact that I minus 5,000 points.
[251.13s -> 252.13s]  If I open this, who's behind here?
[252.13s -> 254.75s]  There's a guy standing right here.
[254.75s -> 256.18s]  Hold on.
[256.18s -> 258.18s]  Can I like break a bottle or something?
[258.18s -> 259.81s]  Do I have a bottle?
[259.81s -> 260.81s]  I got a plunger.
[260.81s -> 262.81s]  Can I like throw the plunger at the door and like freak him out?
[262.81s -> 266.14s]  All right, good, good, good.
[266.14s -> 269.41s]  Perfect.
[269.41s -> 271.41s]  All right, now maybe somebody will come out here and I can distract them.
[271.41s -> 274.67s]  Oh, this guy's got like a worker's hat on.
[274.67s -> 276.94s]  Wait, no, he doesn't.
[276.94s -> 280.52s]  Is that one of like the crew?
[283.70s -> 284.70s]  Is anybody out there?
[284.70s -> 287.78s]  No, it's just not me.
[287.78s -> 292.34s]  He's in the damn doorway.
[292.34s -> 294.34s]  I can't do anything about this.
[294.34s -> 298.21s]  All right, he's walking the other way.
[298.21s -> 299.21s]  Good.
[299.21s -> 303.44s]  Good.
[303.44s -> 304.44s]  Oh, whoa.
[304.44s -> 305.44s]  Oh my God, I'm stuck.
[305.44s -> 310.71s]  I go up these stairs.
[310.71s -> 311.71s]  That's a real question.
[311.71s -> 315.74s]  I don't want to get spotted.
[315.74s -> 318.37s]  There's a guy with a ponytail.
[318.37s -> 321.02s]  What's this disguise?
[321.02s -> 323.77s]  Disguise is a hope goon.
[323.77s -> 325.77s]  But I already am disguised as one of those goons, aren't I?
[325.77s -> 328.90s]  Oh, except I got like a cowboy hat on now.
[328.90s -> 330.90s]  Hey, what's going on, partner?
[330.90s -> 334.70s]  Howdy, partner.
[334.70s -> 337.39s]  So now I should be able to go upstairs now, shouldn't I?
[337.39s -> 339.82s]  Because I'm one of these dudes.
[339.82s -> 341.83s]  Let's see.
[341.83s -> 342.83s]  Let's just find out if I can.
[347.21s -> 348.21s]  I hate spiders, dude.
[348.21s -> 350.21s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[350.21s -> 354.15s]  Oh, well, that's just lovely.
[354.15s -> 356.16s]  That guy's spotting me.
[356.16s -> 358.55s]  All right, where the hell am I going now?
[358.55s -> 360.55s]  I got to go like upstairs, don't I?
[360.55s -> 361.55s]  I got to go over this way.
[361.55s -> 365.89s]  Oh, let's wrap around here.
[365.89s -> 369.34s]  And just for fun, let's like punch this guy in his face.
[369.34s -> 370.34s]  Hold on.
[370.34s -> 374.38s]  Can I go in here?
[374.38s -> 377.62s]  The elevator is likely to have an additional basement entry point.
[377.62s -> 378.62s]  All right, fine.
[378.62s -> 380.38s]  Let's go down here.
[380.38s -> 383.64s]  Let's go down the basement.
[383.64s -> 384.64s]  Let's be a basement dweller.
[384.64s -> 385.64s]  Is it an apatage?
[385.64s -> 394.05s]  No.
[394.05s -> 396.50s]  Why is this?
[396.50s -> 397.50s]  Why am I?
[397.50s -> 398.50s]  Oh, that's to dump bodies.
[398.50s -> 399.50s]  Oh, boy.
[399.50s -> 401.00s]  Oh, boy.
[401.00s -> 402.00s]  Oh, boy.
[402.00s -> 404.20s]  Oh, boy.
[404.20s -> 405.20s]  Hey, fellas.
[405.20s -> 407.53s]  Hey, fellas, how are you?
[407.53s -> 408.53s]  Is that a worker?
[408.53s -> 409.53s]  Yeah, this is a hotel worker.
[409.53s -> 410.53s]  I should probably take his disguise.
[410.53s -> 414.11s]  I don't want a disguise staring at me.
[414.11s -> 417.38s]  Come here.
[417.38s -> 418.62s]  Come here, you son of a...
[418.62s -> 419.62s]  I'm not going to hurt.
[419.62s -> 420.62s]  I'm just going to give you...
[420.62s -> 422.25s]  I'm putting you to sleep.
[422.25s -> 423.25s]  Hold.
[423.25s -> 424.25s]  Don't worry.
[424.25s -> 426.58s]  You'll wake up tomorrow morning and you won't remember that damn thing.
[426.58s -> 428.01s]  Now, give me that.
[428.01s -> 433.22s]  Now, let me dump your ass.
[433.22s -> 434.22s]  What are these guys looking for?
[434.22s -> 436.70s]  Isn't it pretty bright down here?
[436.70s -> 437.70s]  Why would they need a flashlight?
[437.70s -> 439.45s]  Oh, shit.
[439.45s -> 440.45s]  Oh, no.
[440.45s -> 441.45s]  Hey, how you doing?
[441.45s -> 445.25s]  Oh, damn it.
[445.25s -> 446.25s]  Oh, damn it.
[446.25s -> 449.54s]  Oh, why did I?
[449.54s -> 457.45s]  I should have just walked up the damn stairs.
[460.53s -> 461.53s]  They don't know I'm here, though.
[461.53s -> 465.74s]  They just know that somebody is karate chopping their workers in the face.
[465.74s -> 471.06s]  Damn it.
[471.06s -> 473.43s]  Now, he's going to walk up the stairs.
[473.43s -> 474.43s]  Get me out of here.
[474.43s -> 476.74s]  Oh, hello there, sir.
[476.74s -> 480.02s]  See you.
[480.02s -> 481.02s]  All right.
[481.02s -> 482.02s]  I'm going back to the front door.
[482.02s -> 485.57s]  I'm going out this way.
[485.57s -> 490.24s]  I got the stupid terminus gear on.
[490.24s -> 492.24s]  I'm going to go this way, around the corner.
[492.24s -> 495.74s]  Oh, I just picked up more ammo for that snub nose.
[495.74s -> 503.68s]  I haven't met him before.
[503.68s -> 505.68s]  There's only two kinds of people in this world.
[505.68s -> 507.62s]  This lady's nuts.
[507.62s -> 508.62s]  See you later, lady.
[512.04s -> 513.04s]  Okay.
[513.04s -> 515.75s]  Let's go up the stairs.
[515.75s -> 516.75s]  Oh, that was close.
[516.75s -> 518.38s]  Hello.
[518.38s -> 519.38s]  Trespassing.
[519.38s -> 520.38s]  What?
[520.38s -> 521.94s]  I'm a worker.
[521.94s -> 525.39s]  I'm a wor- I work here.
[525.39s -> 528.39s]  Hey, I work at this restaurant, hotel, bar casino.
[528.39s -> 532.10s]  You can't tell me where to go.
[532.10s -> 536.39s]  I can still hear this lady.
[536.39s -> 540.74s]  This lady's annoying.
[546.05s -> 547.80s]  Oh, my God.
[547.80s -> 552.73s]  I couldn't take her talking anymore.
[552.73s -> 554.73s]  She was just talking.
[554.73s -> 556.73s]  She had an ironer in her face.
[556.73s -> 561.44s]  Oh, am I about to dump this poor lady off the window?
[561.44s -> 564.98s]  All right.
[564.98s -> 566.98s]  Well, see you later, grandma.
[566.98s -> 567.98s]  Ah.
[567.98s -> 568.98s]  All right.
[568.98s -> 572.95s]  Let me just tell you guys right now.
[572.95s -> 578.95s]  If I took an iron in my mouth, I would probably instantly, instantly kill me.
[578.95s -> 581.41s]  Hey, don't worry.
[581.41s -> 585.35s]  I'm just doing my work here as a worker.
[585.35s -> 586.35s]  Can I do that?
[586.35s -> 587.35s]  Look at it.
[587.35s -> 588.78s]  It says I can hide here.
[588.78s -> 589.78s]  Yeah, I can do it.
[589.78s -> 592.56s]  See?
[592.56s -> 594.56s]  Hey, just working my, working my job here.
[594.56s -> 595.56s]  Don't worry about a thing.
[595.56s -> 597.56s]  Just everybody stay calm.
[597.56s -> 598.56s]  Stay collected.
[598.56s -> 600.06s]  All right.
[600.06s -> 602.55s]  Now, let me up the goddamn stairs.
[602.55s -> 604.24s]  Ugh.
[604.24s -> 607.38s]  Maybe I got to be one of those workers.
[607.38s -> 609.38s]  All right.
[609.38s -> 610.38s]  Note to self.
[610.38s -> 613.69s]  Go smash a worker's face in with an iron and then take his clothes.
[613.69s -> 614.69s]  Let's try this again.
[614.69s -> 616.82s]  I'm going this way.
[616.82s -> 621.01s]  Right through here.
[621.01s -> 623.89s]  You guys don't see nothing.
[623.89s -> 627.28s]  Looking for one of those guys with a hard hat.
[627.28s -> 629.10s]  God, I'm so stupid.
[629.10s -> 631.10s]  I can't, like, do this mission.
[631.10s -> 633.17s]  All right.
[633.17s -> 634.17s]  Is this one working?
[634.17s -> 636.17s]  But this guy doesn't have a hard hat, so apparently I won't be allowed upstairs.
[637.17s -> 641.07s]  That guy is a worker, though.
[641.07s -> 645.02s]  He's got the worker like clothes on.
[645.02s -> 646.02s]  He's working on the elevator.
[646.02s -> 649.50s]  All right.
[649.50s -> 653.18s]  You know what?
[653.18s -> 654.18s]  Just get out of my face.
[654.18s -> 657.12s]  Oh, right in front of him, too.
[657.12s -> 658.81s]  Don't.
[658.81s -> 659.81s]  That guy's got this.
[659.81s -> 660.81s]  Oh, he's.
[660.81s -> 661.81s]  Oh, great job.
[661.81s -> 662.81s]  No, no, no.
[662.81s -> 663.81s]  You won't get away.
[663.81s -> 664.81s]  You won't.
[664.81s -> 665.81s]  Just calm down.
[665.81s -> 666.81s]  Everybody calm down.
[666.81s -> 668.94s]  Everybody just calm down for a second.
[668.94s -> 670.63s]  Great.
[670.63s -> 671.63s]  Fantastic.
[671.63s -> 672.63s]  Can I jump down here?
[672.63s -> 673.63s]  Jump down like frigging Batman.
[673.63s -> 674.63s]  Come on, man.
[674.63s -> 676.51s]  Oh, my God.
[676.51s -> 677.51s]  They're unloading.
[677.51s -> 678.51s]  They're unloading.
[678.51s -> 679.51s]  Get me out of here.
[679.51s -> 687.79s]  Get me the hell out of here.
[687.79s -> 690.95s]  No.
[690.95s -> 691.95s]  All right, guys.
[691.95s -> 692.95s]  It's time.
[692.95s -> 693.95s]  I tried the.
[693.95s -> 695.71s]  I tried the the nice way.
[695.71s -> 697.95s]  It's time to start unloading on people.
[697.95s -> 702.90s]  Get me out of here.
[702.90s -> 705.42s]  I didn't want to happen to have it come to this.
[705.42s -> 706.42s]  Wow.
[706.42s -> 707.42s]  That was a cool move.
[707.42s -> 708.42s]  All right.
[708.42s -> 710.62s]  I made it.
[710.62s -> 711.62s]  What?
[711.62s -> 712.62s]  I can't proceed without with enemies on high alert.
[712.62s -> 714.12s]  Oh, boy.
[714.12s -> 715.12s]  I'm dead.
[715.12s -> 716.12s]  I'm dead.
[716.12s -> 717.62s]  I'm dead.
[717.62s -> 718.62s]  I'm dead.
[718.62s -> 719.62s]  I'm dead.
[719.62s -> 721.56s]  Oh, crap.
[721.56s -> 722.56s]  No.
[723.08s -> 724.08s]  I'm gonna die right here.
[724.08s -> 725.08s]  I'm gonna die right here.
[725.08s -> 726.96s]  Give me the screwdriver.
[726.96s -> 727.96s]  Backup has arrived.
[727.96s -> 730.64s]  Oh, I'm in so much trouble.
[730.64s -> 731.96s]  I'm in so much trouble.
[731.96s -> 732.96s]  I'm bleeding.
[732.96s -> 735.03s]  I'm dying.
[735.03s -> 737.83s]  The question is, can I hide somewhere?
[737.83s -> 738.83s]  Can I hide somewhere?
[738.83s -> 740.33s]  Where are these guys?
[740.33s -> 741.33s]  One guy over there.
[741.33s -> 742.33s]  One guy coming around the corner right now.
[742.33s -> 745.04s]  All right.
[745.04s -> 746.54s]  What's another one?
[746.54s -> 747.54s]  Got to run.
[747.54s -> 748.54s]  Got to run.
[748.54s -> 750.61s]  Got to run.
[750.61s -> 751.61s]  Get up and run.
[751.61s -> 753.23s]  Get up and run.
[753.23s -> 754.23s]  You stupid idiot.
[754.23s -> 755.23s]  Anybody in here?
[755.23s -> 756.23s]  Come on.
[756.23s -> 757.23s]  I need to like I need like a I need like a basket or something to hide in.
[757.23s -> 758.23s]  It's got to be like a stupid.
[758.23s -> 759.23s]  Like I'm so.
[759.67s -> 760.67s]  Oh, I'm so nervous right now.
[760.67s -> 763.51s]  No.
[763.51s -> 764.51s]  Come on.
[764.51s -> 766.71s]  I've got to hide in.
[766.71s -> 767.71s]  It's all right.
[767.71s -> 768.71s]  I'm good right here.
[768.71s -> 770.53s]  I'm okay.
[770.53s -> 771.53s]  They're still looking for me.
[771.53s -> 772.53s]  Oh, what?
[772.53s -> 774.73s]  I can't believe.
[774.73s -> 775.73s]  How did I gain points?
[775.73s -> 776.90s]  Why?
[776.90s -> 779.81s]  Why?
[779.81s -> 780.81s]  I'm at negative 4,700.
[780.81s -> 781.81s]  I don't know how I got points for doing what I just did.
[781.81s -> 785.99s]  All right.
[785.99s -> 787.79s]  Sooner or later, they're gonna have to give up their search.
[787.79s -> 790.11s]  I can go back to running up the stairs.
[790.11s -> 795.45s]  What a way to do the mission.
[795.45s -> 799.77s]  It only took to mission three for Jerma to completely be an absolute freak show and just
[799.77s -> 801.45s]  unload on everybody he sees.
[803.75s -> 806.88s]  This guy's coming this way.
[806.88s -> 811.86s]  Man, I need to.
[811.86s -> 813.86s]  Can I make my way back up to the stairs now?
[813.86s -> 817.56s]  I mean, I got one prick right here.
[817.56s -> 819.40s]  He's got a shotgun too.
[819.40s -> 821.41s]  Fabulous.
[821.41s -> 830.99s]  Listen, bro, you are gonna I'm gonna Batman the hell out of you.
[830.99s -> 831.99s]  Cautious.
[831.99s -> 832.99s]  All right.
[832.99s -> 833.99s]  We got down to cautious.
[833.99s -> 834.99s]  Got down to cautious.
[834.99s -> 835.99s]  They're looking for me.
[835.99s -> 837.62s]  They're looking for a guy that looks like this.
[837.62s -> 838.62s]  So I need to get behind this guy.
[838.62s -> 840.71s]  I got to take this guy's disguise.
[840.71s -> 841.71s]  Which way is he facing?
[841.71s -> 843.98s]  He's facing that way.
[843.98s -> 845.86s]  Come here.
[845.86s -> 846.86s]  Come on.
[846.86s -> 848.03s]  No, don't go outside.
[848.03s -> 849.03s]  He's the only one, right?
[849.79s -> 852.76s]  No, no.
[852.76s -> 853.76s]  I didn't want to shoot him in the back.
[853.76s -> 856.68s]  I didn't want to shoot the guy in the goddamn back.
[856.68s -> 858.82s]  Why did that happen?
[858.82s -> 859.82s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[859.82s -> 862.46s]  Oh, let me be sneaky.
[862.46s -> 863.46s]  I shot that.
[863.46s -> 864.46s]  No, no.
[864.46s -> 865.46s]  Go back in.
[865.46s -> 866.46s]  Go back in.
[866.46s -> 868.09s]  No.
[868.09s -> 869.97s]  Oh, no.
[869.97s -> 870.97s]  Oh, this is going so badly.
[870.97s -> 874.66s]  This is going so badly.
[874.66s -> 878.46s]  This is going so badly, guys.
[878.46s -> 883.02s]  It's all because I shot the guy in the back and I was trying to choke him.
[883.02s -> 884.02s]  Oh, man.
[884.02s -> 885.86s]  What a complete catastrophe.
[885.86s -> 888.64s]  All right.
[888.64s -> 889.64s]  Come here.
[890.48s -> 892.62s]  Goddamn disguise.
[892.62s -> 894.42s]  And let me just walk up the freaking stairs.
[894.42s -> 897.32s]  All right.
[897.32s -> 899.07s]  Nobody's around.
[899.07s -> 904.32s]  I killed like the whole hotel staff, apparently.
[904.32s -> 906.36s]  Dump this guy's body and go up the stairs.
[906.36s -> 911.91s]  I'm making this way more difficult and way more complicated than I have to be.
[911.91s -> 914.88s]  Get in there.
[914.88s -> 916.00s]  Sorry for shooting you in the back.
[916.00s -> 917.00s]  I didn't want to do that.
[917.00s -> 918.00s]  I wanted to choke you.
[918.00s -> 926.32s]  Well, oh, good thing I got 135 points for hiding the body.
[926.32s -> 931.76s]  Don't mind me.
[931.76s -> 932.76s]  Call the elevator.
[932.76s -> 937.61s]  Hey, look at that.
[937.61s -> 940.83s]  Sweet.
[940.95s -> 946.26s]  That guy completed the mission.
[946.26s -> 947.26s]  Can I get in?
[947.26s -> 948.26s]  Oh, yeah.
[948.26s -> 949.70s]  I think this is it.
[949.70s -> 951.83s]  Hey, let's go.
[951.83s -> 956.79s]  So that is going to wrap it up here for this first part of the hotel mission.
[956.79s -> 958.75s]  So I'll see you guys all soon.
[958.75s -> 961.79s]  And stay tuned for the next part of the hotel, upper floors.
[961.79s -> 963.31s]  And take care, everybody.
