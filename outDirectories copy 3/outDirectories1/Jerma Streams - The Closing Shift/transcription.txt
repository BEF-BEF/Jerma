[2.62s -> 7.54s]  Hello everybody. I don't want to scare you. That's why I'm talking really lightly.
[10.76s -> 22.63s]  Okay, so we're changing the game here. Let me just change this. So this is the closing shift.
[22.63s -> 30.23s]  This is requested. A game where you run a coffee shop but it's very scary or something. I don't
[30.23s -> 51.82s]  know. Haunted coffee shop? Closing shift. All right, is there an audio warning with this game? Is this
[51.82s -> 61.59s]  gonna- is this a game that's gonna scream and blow everybody's eardrums out? Or what? Gotta be careful
[61.59s -> 73.58s]  of this. It's not it. Okay. All right, let me put this over here so you guys can see what's going on.
[73.58s -> 99.88s]  I turn the lights off. This is closing shift. Should I make the lights off? I want me to dim this-
[99.88s -> 116.39s]  this one? Should I dim the ring light thing? What? Is it good? Turn off the VHS effect. I don't have
[116.39s -> 145.67s]  settings. Let me just move this. All right, let's go guys. New game. Oh no, I'll be late for work.
[145.67s -> 153.53s]  I should be on my- I should be on my car by now. DST, Tab, Shift, Run, Crouch, Inventory. Okay.
[153.53s -> 167.30s]  Well, that's- the sensitivity is so high. All right, graphics. Resolution, yeah. Texture quality,
[167.30s -> 182.01s]  12 and a half percent. Why would it be 12? That seems really low. Couldn't it be 100?
[182.01s -> 196.76s]  What is it, milk? Like, milk percent? It's for the effects. Oh. Okay, hard and- SSR, overkill,
[196.76s -> 204.73s]  VHS filter, off. Yeah, that makes- I'll puke if that's on. Controls, yeah. Our general,
[204.73s -> 224.31s]  make sure this is good. Even lower? Okay. Refresh, it's changed. Okay, let's do it.
[225.59s -> 230.60s]  Do you drink skim milk? One percent, two percent raw or whole milk? Two percent.
[230.60s -> 234.36s]  Anything else is just- it's just- I mean, one percent's fine. One percent and two percent are
[234.36s -> 239.48s]  both. Like, why would you drink anything else? Whole milk is good if you- okay. No. You know what?
[239.48s -> 245.88s]  I had whole milk recently and it really tasted like- I don't know, it tasted like fucking meat.
[245.88s -> 252.41s]  It was weird. It tasted like beef, like meat. I didn't like it. I haven't had it in a long time.
[252.41s -> 260.25s]  All right, I'm gonna be late for work. I gotta hurry up. Leave apartment. Wait,
[260.25s -> 278.20s]  do I need to take anything? I think I'm good. Let's go. Well, you know the difference of one
[278.20s -> 281.48s]  percent and two percent were side by side. Probably not, no. But I could tell you the
[281.48s -> 283.96s]  difference between skim and one percent. I could tell you the difference between two percent and
[283.96s -> 299.64s]  skim. One percent at whole. I have to go to work. I think I need the sensitivity drop even more.
[299.64s -> 309.05s]  Has anyone ever had their mouse sensitivity further than here on every single PC video
[309.05s -> 320.63s]  game that has ever released? Ever. That has ever released. I don't think- I don't think so.
[320.63s -> 330.92s]  That's better. Mine is- it's always so, so high. Really? Is my DPI just all fucked up or something?
[330.92s -> 348.01s]  What the fuck was that? Was that a flashlight or anything? I thought that was a gun. Someone's phone.
[348.01s -> 370.36s]  What do I do with this? Someone's phone. Use it? How do I use it? Enter? E? I need to go through-
[371.00s -> 391.08s]  no need to go through here right now. E. It doesn't do anything? All right, how do I get out of here?
[391.08s -> 423.48s]  What do I just do? This is so dark I can't see anything. I missed it? Go to the car. Wait. Oh.
[423.48s -> 443.77s]  Oh, okay. Get in the car. How do I get in the car? E? Lights off. The lights are off! That's
[443.77s -> 464.47s]  the wrong car. Doesn't seem like it. Hold on. Run. Interact. Yeah, I'm clicking. Clicking. Click.
[464.47s -> 481.45s]  Click. That's the right car. Yeah. Click. Am I supposed to be able to open this? I didn't get the
[481.45s -> 503.62s]  car key. Oh, come on. I can't see anything. I need the keys to the car. Okay. How far up was
[503.62s -> 514.98s]  my apartment? Is it all the way up? This one here, right? Dude, I don't know what apartment is mine.
[514.98s -> 528.92s]  Which apartment is mine? Wasn't it up here? He's going to- I don't know what apartment mine is.
[530.58s -> 539.82s]  Is it up another thing? Down a floor? I might need to put the phone down. I don't- How do you
[539.82s -> 553.29s]  put the phone down? Items in hand. All right. Tab. Left, right. Scroll. Space. Go back to the car.
[553.29s -> 572.98s]  People just f**king with me? All right. I'm- Somebody- What does it say? Look for a person.
[572.98s -> 597.32s]  I can't go that way. Find the owner. Give the phone to the guy. What guy? This guy- This guy
[597.32s -> 605.16s]  couldn't see this guy. This guy didn't exist. All right. Is it as dark for you as it is for me?
[605.16s -> 619.88s]  Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, um, are you looking for something? Well, I found this. Give me it.
[619.88s -> 640.34s]  Welcome. I just want to test something. Oh, that's kind of creepy. I kind of hate it, but I like it.
[640.34s -> 664.97s]  This is my car. Okay. Go to work. My car. I actually don't mind this because it's not
[664.97s -> 673.94s]  shaky and jittery. This is actually not bad looking. Open and close. Okay. So it's time for
[673.94s -> 714.41s]  work. Do I get an employee door? No reflection. God damn it. Okay. Put away my stuff and talk to
[715.05s -> 735.26s]  Senpai02. Back room here. Sorry, I'm late. Be careful next time. I'm going to tell the manager.
[735.26s -> 747.75s]  Turn up the game volume. I'm very sorry. I'll be careful. Being careful is not enough. Tell me you
[747.75s -> 755.13s]  won't be late. Do you understand? Yes, sir. I will not be late again. You also messed up some orders,
[755.13s -> 760.57s]  don't you? If you have any trouble with the order, there are some tutorial videos for you. So look
[760.57s -> 767.11s]  through it. Okay. I'll take a look. Oh, and one more thing. Never know what's going to happen in
[767.11s -> 773.29s]  imaginopolis. If you ever need any help, just click me. Make sure to leave your phone in the
[773.29s -> 785.16s]  locker. You better not be texting anyone during work. Yes, sir. That was so weird. It's like
[785.16s -> 795.05s]  somebody magnetized him through the door. Okay. Put my stuff away. A phone. Is that it? My car key.
[796.60s -> 804.46s]  Recipes. Ooh. Okay. Hot. Drip coffee is just coffee. A latte. I know all this. I already know
[804.46s -> 811.64s]  all this. Latte. Coffee and milk. Green tea latte. Vanilla syrup steamed milk matcha powder.
[811.64s -> 820.92s]  I'm drinking one of those right now. Well, not a latte, but all right. Easy. Caramel macchiato.
[820.92s -> 832.71s]  I don't even look. That is drip coffee, water, and whatever flavor the customer asks for. No,
[832.71s -> 838.65s]  sorry. That's an Americano. Whoops. Who cares? It's my first day. Americano is water and espresso.
[838.65s -> 849.86s]  I fucking got it completely wrong. Oops. All right. So cool. Chocolate chip chilla
[849.86s -> 857.99s]  peccino. Blended ice, coffee, milk, chocolate sauce. All right. Well, whatever. I think I know
[857.99s -> 872.46s]  what I'm doing. Corial video. Oh, we're already starting. Can I help you? Did you say chillas
[872.46s -> 876.78s]  coffee? I've never been to one of these fancy places before. I feel uneasy. There's something
[876.78s -> 883.06s]  strange about this place. My daughter seems to be a fan of this place and now I'm here. However,
[883.86s -> 889.78s]  uh, I'll leave the drinks to you. Oh, and I'd like to get two of them. Would you want a latte
[889.78s -> 897.59s]  and a coffee? Oh, that'd be just fine. It's really uncomfortable here. However, can you charge such
[897.59s -> 911.22s]  a price for something like this? Do you want a latte and a coffee? Order sticker. Okay. Coffee.
[911.22s -> 924.14s]  Coffee. Got that. Here's your coffee, sir. Thank you so much. And, uh, also you wanted a latte,
[924.14s -> 932.17s]  which is coffee and steamed milk. You got it. Okay. Coffee and steamed milk.
[934.94s -> 947.02s]  Ah, boulders. Where's the steamed milk? Isn't this right here? How do I turn this on?
[951.37s -> 961.94s]  Just one moment, sir. How do I turn that on? No, I don't want ice in there. How do I turn the milk
[961.94s -> 980.79s]  on? I need milk. Oh shit. Okay. That's it, right? There you go.
[984.63s -> 986.62s]  What happened? Huh?
[991.64s -> 1014.79s]  Okay. There's my steamed milk. There's my coffee. How do I put the coffee? How do I put the steamed
[1014.79s -> 1027.93s]  milk in the coffee? Just click it. Does that work? I need the lid, but is that a latte right now?
[1027.93s -> 1049.53s]  I'm so confused. That is a latte, so I just need a lid. Where are the lids? Okay.
[1057.82s -> 1080.42s]  Will you pick it up? I need to label it? Where's the labeler? Cold cup lids? I don't know. Does it
[1080.42s -> 1098.26s]  label? Sticker? It's in your inventory already. What about this thing? Okay, so I'm going to pick
[1098.26s -> 1104.46s]  that up if I touch that. Watch the tutorial on the computer. All right, we'll just sit there for a
[1104.46s -> 1127.08s]  minute because I don't... Okay. I can't click the computer. Oh, how do I watch the tutorial?
[1127.08s -> 1139.40s]  He's getting a zero star review. It's behind the computer. What? There's nothing behind the
[1139.40s -> 1158.73s]  computer. Just one minute, sir. I'm still working on this. Is it in here? Don't put a cleaning
[1158.73s -> 1169.16s]  product in the guy's fucking drink. Order sticker. Latte. That's not the latte. All right. Can I
[1169.16s -> 1183.43s]  throw shit in the trash? That's... I don't even know what that is. Is there a trash? All right,
[1183.43s -> 1190.47s]  clicking anything just picks it up. How do I throw this shit in the trash? Like, just throw it all
[1190.47s -> 1200.10s]  away. All of it. Besides that. Throw the whole thing in the trash. Okay. Coffee. Coffee cup.
[1200.18s -> 1217.82s]  Hot coffee. Milk. There's milk. Steam the milk. Great. Put milk in there. Label.
[1222.20s -> 1234.26s]  Cover. Label. Bro. What the fuck is going on here? It's just gone. He left. What the fuck?
[1234.98s -> 1276.95s]  Watch the tapes. What tapes? Oh my fucking God. Okay. What is that? Okay. That's how you...

[1292.47s -> 1295.19s]  I just was like, I'm out of here. You obviously don't know what you're doing.
[1295.99s -> 1302.87s]  Yup. That's what I did. Steam the milk. That's what I did. That's exactly what I just did. Take
[1302.87s -> 1308.92s]  the cup. Put it over there. Steam milk inside of it. What did I do wrong? Put the cup. Do it.
[1308.92s -> 1318.42s]  Put it down. Put a lid on it. And then put the coffee label on that. Okay. It just disappeared.
[1319.14s -> 1336.49s]  I did the whole thing right. Let me make sure I get this right. Yeah. You do cold coffee.
[1337.69s -> 1347.80s]  Or do you do hot coffee? Ice. Blend up the ice. Put the board in there. It's the shit
[1347.80s -> 1351.56s]  disappearing from your hand or disappearing and going into your inventory that's like freaking
[1351.56s -> 1357.56s]  me out. Do the whatever you want for those flavors. Put the bullshit in here like the
[1357.56s -> 1363.40s]  cinnamon twigs or whatever the hell it is. All right. I get it. Where's the fucking next customer?
[1363.40s -> 1373.66s]  I hope you're in the news. I hear stalker cases are on the rise. It's scary. Women like me,
[1373.66s -> 1378.82s]  you see, I have to be careful. All the guys are always staring at me. So careful too.
[1379.46s -> 1385.80s]  They don't have to worry as much as I do, but you should watch out either way. Dark mocha chip
[1386.60s -> 1397.22s]  please. Dark mocha chip. You got it. Dark blended ice, coffee, milk, chocolate,
[1397.22s -> 1412.18s]  blended ice, coffee, milk, chocolate. Okay. There's no ice in there. Ice. Cold cup.

[1468.71s -> 1477.48s]  chocolate syrup. I see chocolate. I'm making the wrong one. Just regular chocolate. Did it go in?
[1479.56s -> 1497.16s]  I never said dark. All right. Here you go. There you are. Thank you.
[1498.20s -> 1525.54s]  God, do I really need the ticket on there? Oh, come on. Enjoy. The powder makes it dark.

[5754.18s -> 5766.09s]  a scene? Yeah, come on. I won't be here for long. No, it would not. So legally that's out of the
[5766.49s -> 5772.41s]  question. Wouldn't it be a disaster if a customer catches a cold? I'm trying to. I won't be here
[5772.41s -> 5778.92s]  for long. No, it would not. So legally that's out of the question. Wouldn't it be a disaster

[5872.30s -> 5896.98s]  where's my stuff? What if this never gets scary and you just have to do this for 300 nights in a
[5896.98s -> 5907.05s]  row? Um, why does that happen? I mean, it's already been fucking scary. It's already been
[5907.05s -> 5982.44s]  fucking weird. Which trash is there? Is there a second toilet? Is it two toilets? Wait, wait,

[6048.34s -> 6062.06s]  One, two, hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Stop it. Why is it doing that
[6062.06s -> 6081.86s]  shit, man? All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. What the fuck is happening right now?
[6082.50s -> 6095.34s]  Huh? What's happening? What's going on? I have five seconds. I don't get it. What happened?
[6105.14s -> 6124.82s]  Oh, run. Excuse me. What the fuck are you talking about, dude? I can't fucking leave. I'm stuck
[6124.82s -> 6175.64s]  here. What's going on? What's actually going on? I can't do anything. Where's my bracelet?
[6175.64s -> 6208.31s]  Didn't I have a magic bracelet? I didn't throw it away. Clean up. I think I'm stuck in here.
[6208.31s -> 6256.97s]  I think I got, I got soft-locked. I think you threw it away on accident. No way. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[6267.42s -> 6291.34s]  That would have been scarier if I had actually, I had to walk down the middle aisle. Why are
[6291.34s -> 6358.22s]  they demons? What were the demons? Dude, why are they demons? Holy shit. No more. This jump
[6358.22s -> 6367.85s]  scare is right here. Don't do it. What does that sound? What is it? Okay. I'm, I hear shit going
[6367.85s -> 6371.03s]  on right now and I'm just going to go. I don't need to, what do you mean I don't need to go
[6371.03s -> 6422.70s]  through here? Pop the trunk. Fuck, entire iron. I don't even have any stuff anymore. My suspicions
[6422.70s -> 6429.43s]  were true. Glad you contacted me. Calling the police won't help. All they'll do is brush things
[6429.43s -> 6435.61s]  off to lessen, wait, when did I do that? And why are people like me? I'll take a look around and
[6435.61s -> 6461.06s]  see if I can find anything. Did they call? Oh, okay. Hey, all the caramel mocha here is so
[6461.06s -> 6466.33s]  delicious. I think you'll love it Senpai. Okay, I guess I'll try it then. One salted caramel mocha.
[6466.33s -> 6475.35s]  I'll have a dark mocha chip chilapecino. You're not getting that? Yeah, I want to try something
[6475.35s -> 6480.81s]  different today. I already had one today. I see, but a chilapecino is on a day like this. You're
[6480.81s -> 6487.13s]  so young because it's so delicious. How would you like to pay your bill? Oh, is today the day of the
[6487.13s -> 6490.81s]  photo shoot or something? Is the store going to be featured in a newspaper or something?
[6492.66s -> 6498.68s]  No, I don't think so. Why? Well, I saw someone outside taking pictures. Taking pictures of the
[6498.68s -> 6505.42s]  store. The store and you most likely. I did my makeup. What are you talking about? I'm sorry,
[6505.42s -> 6510.38s]  we'll pay together. The drinks are on me. What are you sure? Thank you so much Senpai. I'm in a good
[6510.38s -> 6515.88s]  mood lately. My son used to be outed and this is a better, he's in a better mood now that he's
[6515.88s -> 6522.23s]  going to school. Son's in middle school, right? Yeah, let's hope he wasn't bullied at school.
[6522.95s -> 6531.54s]  I didn't have any good memory when I was his age. What do you guys, what do you want?
[6531.54s -> 6540.94s]  Why do I have all these latte tickets? I can't throw these away. Okay, chocolate chip,
[6540.94s -> 6587.66s]  chocolate chip chilapecino, ice, coffee, milk, sauce, powder, and whatever. Ice, coffee, milk,
[6587.66s -> 6607.13s]  powder, and syrup, right? Chocolate syrup. Okay, there you go. And the other one was a salted
[6607.13s -> 6629.18s]  caramel mocha. Coffee, milk, caramel, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, milk, caramel, hazelnut,
[6629.18s -> 6656.81s]  chocolate. Remember, there are seven secret recipes you need to find. I feel like that's a
[6656.81s -> 6691.27s]  lie. Where's the protective guy? Oh, it's the jump scare lady. How is this haunted? I mean,
[6691.83s -> 6696.71s]  I just was being chased by like demons. I don't know. This is like a fucking weirdo.
[6696.71s -> 6710.28s]  Salted caramel mocha. Salted caramel mocha is coffee, milk, caramel, hazelnut, syrup, hazelnut,
[6712.76s -> 6728.55s]  caramel, hazelnut, chocolate. Cold or hot? I just made it, whatever. What is that noise?
[6728.55s -> 6748.79s]  Not soy. Caramel, hazelnut, chocolate. What is that going on? You okay?
[6796.39s -> 6811.56s]  That's strange. Oh, I'm sorry. Give me the usual. I don't know which one of these is. Can I throw
[6811.56s -> 6827.13s]  this shit away? I have so much. Okay, salted caramel mocha. Sweet red beans and butter bread.
[6827.13s -> 6838.14s]  Sweet red beans and butter bread. What's sweet red bean butter bread? We don't serve that here.
[6838.14s -> 6848.97s]  What the hell is a sweet red bean and butter bread? British food? Yeah, that sounds like a
[6848.97s -> 6864.73s]  fucking Harry Potter item. Sweet red bean butter bread. What? I don't. Oh, we do own that. You
[6864.73s -> 6872.57s]  wanted a salted caramel mocha. I know how to do that. I did that like five times already.
[6872.57s -> 6907.86s]  Salted caramel mocha. It's caramel, hazelnut, chocolate. And you also want caramel macchiato,
[6907.86s -> 6916.34s]  which I believe that's cold. It is. No, it's not. Coffee, milk, caramel, caramel.
[6935.80s -> 6946.58s]  There you go. What happened to my beads? Seriously, where'd they go? Are you repairing
[6946.58s -> 6957.21s]  the store's antenna at this hour? No, ma'am. Why? I saw someone on the roof. There shouldn't
[6957.21s -> 6961.53s]  be anyone on the roof. Who would be the investigator? Maybe I should check it out.
[6961.53s -> 6969.77s]  Could have been my imagination. Anyway, the drink, please. Investigator up on the roof?
[6969.77s -> 6977.13s]  The investigator is going to be like dead or something, right? It's going to be, I don't know.
[6977.45s -> 7043.43s]  Something horrible. Should I put it or should I put the ladder on? You go up here with a
[7043.43s -> 7052.47s]  fucking tire iron, climb the ladder and then pull the ladder up and fucking use it. You know what
[7052.47s -> 7084.70s]  I mean? Like I'm like, I don't want to, I don't want to go up there without something. I go over
[7084.70s -> 7105.54s]  there. Any reason that can I like jump? Why can I climb this? Yeah. All right. So what? I don't want
[7105.54s -> 7119.16s]  to go in there. Okay. It's like, pick this up. These things are like probably fucking 25 pounds
[7119.16s -> 7133.59s]  each. Yell down there. Detective, detective, are you down there? Detective? Brought that
[7133.59s -> 7171.42s]  fucking thing down. Oh God damn it. I have to close the store fast. Unlock the door. Unlock the door.
[7171.42s -> 7192.30s]  What? I gotta close the door fast. Gun. No. What the fuck? What am I, why am I taking all this?
[7192.30s -> 7202.87s]  I don't understand. Why am I picking up all the food? Get the money. What do I do? What's going on?
[7204.41s -> 7242.38s]  Why did I pick up every item in the fucking thing? Throw it all away? What else? What else? What else?
[7242.38s -> 7249.66s]  What else is going on? Sandwich? Count product. One, two, what? I don't get it. Count product.
[7249.66s -> 7254.44s]  Count product. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
[7254.44s -> 7261.93s]  fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Start over. Start over. Two, four, six, eight, ten. Two, four, six, eight,
[7261.93s -> 7266.25s]  ten, eleven. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. I got twenty-one here. Twenty-one.
[7266.25s -> 7269.38s]  Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. What do I do now? Twenty-one.
[7269.38s -> 7274.81s]  Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. What
[7274.81s -> 7295.11s]  do I do? Twenty-one. Gone? I thought that said police scanner. Okay, now what? What's left? What's
[7295.11s -> 7330.01s]  left? What's left? Get money. Did I get it? Count the money? Goodbye. Okay. Fuck you. Fuck you,
[7330.01s -> 7334.46s]  motherfucker. Fuck you. Pick up something heavy. Something that can fucking hit somebody in the
[7334.46s -> 7350.50s]  face. Like a printer. Or where's my stuff? Room. I don't know. Is this locked? Oh shit, he's gone.
[7350.50s -> 7363.16s]  He was at the drive-thru. He was at the drive-thru. He was at the drive-thru. Where do I go? Where
[7363.16s -> 7372.49s]  do I go? Are these photographs of me? Screwdriver. I'm stabbing him. Screwdriver. This is fucking
[7372.49s -> 7375.82s]  perfect. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
[7375.82s -> 7380.76s]  Screwdriver. What do I do with the screwdriver? What do I do with the screwdriver? What would you
[7380.76s -> 7385.40s]  open that door for, you idiot? Why would I open the back door? What do I do with screwdriver?
[7385.40s -> 7400.71s]  What do I do with screwdriver? Where's the vent? Vent? Where's the vent? Where's the actual- Where's
[7400.71s -> 7407.34s]  the vent? Where is it? I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do it. I can't. I can't. I can't
[7407.34s -> 7409.58s]  do that. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I don't know
[7409.58s -> 7424.90s]  what to do. I can't do it. I can't do it. Guys, I can't do it. Should I run to the car? Run to the
[7424.90s -> 7436.39s]  car? Ladder. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Where's the fucking ladder? How do I-
[7437.43s -> 7454.58s]  Look at all this shit I have. All right, shut this fucking thing. Shut this fucking thing.
[7455.22s -> 7477.83s]  How do I close this? Brick? Okay, do it. Drop it on his head. Drop it on his head. He killed
[7477.83s -> 7492.92s]  detective. All right, where is he? Drop it on his head. Crush him. Crush him with the brick.
[7492.92s -> 7526.04s]  I got him. Yes. I got him. I told you. Fucking TV. Something heavy. Big crush. I ran to the police
[7526.04s -> 7531.34s]  until, please, everything happened. Police took me back to the scene and that man was no longer
[7531.34s -> 7546.02s]  there. There was no one there. Investigated the scene. Hired after that. Wait a minute. It's not-
[7546.02s -> 7586.22s]  This is not over. I want to rest peacefully at home. Dude. Cable's acting weird again. Call the
[7586.30s -> 7606.82s]  owner. I even- I bricked the guy. I bricked him. Where's my phone? Dude, I bricked the guy too.
[7606.82s -> 7678.63s]  Really? What the fuck? Yeah, I have stereo sound. I know it's out here, but I don't want to do- I
[7678.63s -> 7764.90s]  don't want to go out here. Where is it? Give me another brick. I still- I still have the-
[7764.90s -> 7771.54s]  All right, motherfucker. You didn't think I still had a fucking broom? Honest to fucking god.
[7771.62s -> 7835.38s]  Where is the- What? Where's the phone? Dude, I dropped a cinder block on his head. On his head.
[7892.94s -> 7906.31s]  He played a little vampire survivors. Relax. He survived a cinder block, dropped 10 feet. Dude,
[7906.31s -> 7914.81s]  your head would cave in. Your head would go- would go like this. You would have a dent. Like,
[7914.81s -> 7932.30s]  you would crush your brain from- That was- That was fucking creepy.
[7932.30s -> 7944.58s]  Remember, that's cartoon logic. Is it though? I mean, I don't know, man. If somebody dropped a
[7944.58s -> 7952.49s]  cinder block from like 10 feet in the air on your head, I don't think you're gonna make it.
[7952.49s -> 7984.58s]  I don't think you're gonna make it. How's your review? I was actually talking to Holly about
[7984.58s -> 7996.44s]  this. And the PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 kind of aesthetic makes everything just feel awful.
[7996.44s -> 8003.34s]  It just does. This kind of new trend of the last like, what, three, four years or so of kind of
[8003.34s -> 8012.87s]  de-making these experiences, everything just feels like a dream. PlayStation 1 graphics is what people
[8012.87s -> 8024.02s]  look like in a dream. Like this. That's what a human looks like to me in a dream. I think that's
[8024.02s -> 8041.06s]  what makes it that much more unsettling. And I think I would like to see a lot more companies
[8042.94s -> 8048.78s]  instead of going with the- looking how awesome the graphics are and how huge the budget is and
[8048.78s -> 8053.82s]  look there's all this crazy stuff all these crazy like sun god rays and beams that come through the
[8053.82s -> 8064.38s]  window. These experiences are just kind of way more unsettling. It's way more weird and just
[8064.38s -> 8078.39s]  kind of off-putting and awful. PS1 brain? You do not have dreams in 1080p. I'm sorry, you just don't.
