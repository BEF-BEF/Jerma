[6512.49s -> 6520.78s]  They made that but I can't panic which is that's hard
[6521.34s -> 6527.99s]  That's asking a lot
[6541.26s -> 6545.98s]  Don't use the mortars here. I would keep the shotgun out. That's the bread and butter

[7353.69s -> 7363.13s]  The meat hook wounds in your back still throb as you make your way down the cold black and bloody hallways
[7364.01s -> 7369.13s]  Uh that once held these monstrous creatures you leave the ruined town of dusk behind littered with the corpses of possessed
[7369.77s -> 7371.77s]  hoping never to return
[7372.15s -> 7376.95s]  This is standing imposing syllabus of what appeared to be military facility, but why a dark voice pushes forward
[7376.95s -> 7382.39s]  Do you truly seek answers or is it simply too late to turn back continue the dusk experience in episode two?
[7383.59s -> 7387.62s]  the facilities

[7424.70s -> 7427.90s]  This difficulty is not intended for a first playthrough
[7428.62s -> 7435.38s]  This is my first playthrough. That's what i've been doing
[7441.62s -> 7444.34s]  Do dusk mirror for one level. All right, i'll turn it on for one level
[7455.22s -> 7457.22s]  How fast are the chainsaw guys?
[7461.27s -> 7468.07s]  All right, because it's a new level. I don't like this. I want to have all my stuff
[7468.79s -> 7479.37s]  I don't it's not about how fast you can go guys. It's about how cool you look
[7481.08s -> 7528.22s]  I think I look kind of cool in some of these fights. That's they're too far away. That's not fair
[7535.16s -> 7536.76s]  guns give me
[7536.76s -> 7540.95s]  Any more guns? Yeah, of course. There is much if I didn't look back here

[7549.06s -> 7551.50s]  Maldi why am I malding?
[7552.30s -> 7560.30s]  What the hell did I do?

[7573.96s -> 7576.28s]  Welcome everybody that was in tomato stream. Thanks for the raid
[7576.92s -> 7581.96s]  I wonder what you're doing. I don't know why I just did that this
[7582.44s -> 7585.48s]  This is what happens when my brain has to focus on two things at the same time
[7586.28s -> 7588.84s]  I just I just threw a box in there and tried to shoot it
[7589.56s -> 7594.31s]  I don't know what I was doing. But thank you. Welcome everybody. We're playing dusk
[7595.19s -> 7599.10s]  And I think I got everything I need to get the blue key card
[7601.37s -> 7603.05s]  Red door is back here

[7658.04s -> 7665.46s]  All right, let me get behind here
[7665.78s -> 7667.70s]  Actually do that though
[7667.70s -> 7679.50s]  What was the point of this?

[7706.25s -> 7708.25s]  I feel like there'd be something back here
[7708.41s -> 7709.93s]  But there's not

[7986.54s -> 7988.70s]  Uh, no, I can't how do I get up there?
[7989.98s -> 8001.18s]  How do I do I can get up there? Hold on
[8016.74s -> 8024.87s]  Now
[8024.87s -> 8032.84s]  Yeah, come on. I'm trying to jump into that window
[8033.56s -> 8056.98s]  Okay, I gotta slow down. Wait
[8057.70s -> 8077.42s]  What's the play here I can't jump up what am I supposed to do though? How do I get up there?
[8083.78s -> 8086.18s]  I did it. I did the thing I wanted to do but I didn't get what I want
[8087.29s -> 8095.93s]  This guy wouldn't last two minutes. What did I just step on? I can get up there. Hold on. I'm gonna try to get back in there
[8110.50s -> 8111.94s]  so
[8111.94s -> 8112.90s]  um
[8112.90s -> 8116.74s]  Other tower or something. Let me see
[8119.82s -> 8121.96s]  How do I get that?
[8121.96s -> 8133.66s]  Can I climb up that thing?
[8133.66s -> 8140.04s]  Wait, oh, there's a fucking gun right there double shotgun. Just get it
[8141.00s -> 8148.87s]  All right double shotgun
[8148.87s -> 8152.23s]  Okay, so
[8152.23s -> 8156.66s]  I want to get this stuff
[8156.66s -> 8158.66s]  But I don't I don't know how to do it
[8158.90s -> 8170.12s]  Okay, then
[8170.12s -> 8185.22s]  Help me
[8185.22s -> 8193.37s]  No, what do you mean? No, I'm asking for your help
[8197.26s -> 8201.61s]  It's more fun when you don't know
[8201.69s -> 8205.85s]  Obviously, I mean I have to go from here to there. I'm probably do I have to jump from there to there?
[8205.93s -> 8207.93s]  That's what I was thinking of trying to do
[8208.09s -> 8230.15s]  That's the only way to get over there
[8230.15s -> 8233.26s]  Okay, I i'm not i'm not quite
[8234.22s -> 8265.05s]  Correct though. Uh, what over here? Can I do anything with these?
[8271.61s -> 8279.14s]  Do I have to come back with a barrel though, it's probably something so simple that i'm not seeing
[8283.10s -> 8290.95s]  Let me try that again wait, it's f9 right there you go
[8296.20s -> 8298.20s]  Death from above what does that mean?
[8298.84s -> 8310.15s]  What I heard something

[8311.43s -> 8317.82s]  Should I get the magic sickle?
[8318.63s -> 8320.63s]  Hold walk to climb anything
[8322.50s -> 8326.18s]  Oh, oh
[8326.18s -> 8328.33s]  Hold walk what?
[8328.33s -> 8330.49s]  Hold walk to climb anything. What are you gonna?
[8331.21s -> 8335.06s]  Walk is shit
[8335.06s -> 8337.06s]  I thought it meant like just hold walk up
[8345.27s -> 8346.23s]  Oh
[8346.23s -> 8350.26s]  Now what do I oh no, okay. I think I blew it
[8350.98s -> 8361.91s]  No, I didn't no this shit just opened

[8442.33s -> 8445.10s]  blue door
[8445.10s -> 8446.62s]  red door
[8446.62s -> 8467.32s]  Just talking
[8467.32s -> 8472.60s]  That just swung around me new viewer here. I remember that happened to me too. It was not fun
[8473.48s -> 8476.04s]  Oh, thanks. Appreciate it. Welcome to the screen
[8491.94s -> 8494.90s]  What a wait, but what about the door? There was a yellow door
[8498.06s -> 8499.90s]  What was that yellow door?
[8499.90s -> 8507.18s]  New viewer here. Can you just gotta do a flip? Yeah. Oh, yeah
[8507.82s -> 8509.34s]  I've done it on stream
[8509.34s -> 8526.33s]  How do I open this? I know that means I could break it. I need to use the rivet gun
[8527.61s -> 8530.65s]  Lie
[8530.65s -> 8532.65s]  Oh, that's the rivet gun
[8533.58s -> 8535.58s]  Right. Thank you for that
[8535.90s -> 8545.82s]  Just extra ammo. Oh, there was extra ammo in that secret area
[8546.70s -> 8556.15s]  Oh
[8556.15s -> 8559.61s]  You know how I know people hate that
[8559.61s -> 8561.61s]  because yawning is
[8562.25s -> 8565.13s]  Seen as one of the most obnoxious things to hear
[8588.78s -> 8589.82s]  easy
[8589.82s -> 8594.30s]  What's this mess?
[8595.27s -> 8597.83s]  Oh red door. I need the red key
[8599.03s -> 8600.71s]  It's electrified
[8600.71s -> 8602.71s]  Am I gonna get killed electrocution?
[8604.46s -> 8609.59s]  artifact storage
[8609.59s -> 8611.59s]  Don't go in the ruins
[8612.44s -> 8614.36s]  Oh, well, I will
[8614.36s -> 8629.58s]  Don't worry. I will
[8629.58s -> 8631.42s]  Is that a person? I don't know
[8631.42s -> 8658.92s]  Let's go. Oh, there's nothing here. Wait. I got steered for no reason. What about that?
[8659.48s -> 8661.48s]  This looks suspicious
[8661.64s -> 8684.34s]  Where am I going? It's just a cool secret
[8685.06s -> 8688.71s]  Look at that
[8688.71s -> 8693.48s]  Oh, all right
[8693.48s -> 8710.50s]  Nice. It's very
[8711.88s -> 8713.88s]  I don't like how claustrophobic it is down here
[8725.77s -> 8728.17s]  You're gonna bust out of the jail cells
[8729.59s -> 8733.51s]  Is there I know it's gonna happen this happens in every video game with the someone at the end of the hall
[8734.31s -> 8738.15s]  Don't trust your eyes. Okay, i'm not gonna trust my eyes. I'm gonna run this way. I'm gonna go i'm gonna leave
[8738.15s -> 8740.15s]  I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna leave home
[8741.90s -> 8745.48s]  I think I killed something
[8745.56s -> 8755.54s]  Did I just kill one?
[8755.54s -> 8758.02s]  How many do I have to kill?
[8758.02s -> 8763.54s]  Oh, at least they have a lot of health
[8763.54s -> 8765.54s]  Don't trust your eyes
[8765.70s -> 8768.14s]  That means I could walk through this
[8768.70s -> 8772.46s]  Oh really? I thought that was gonna be like this is fake and you walk through the wall and this is the next part
[8773.18s -> 8777.35s]  How do I open this
[8777.35s -> 8785.10s]  Is there a switch to open this stuff?
[8791.06s -> 8793.06s]  Oh don't even need a switch
[8794.31s -> 8795.75s]  Got the mortar
[8795.75s -> 8802.79s]  He's talking about the invisible enemies
[8803.19s -> 8805.99s]  I don't know. I don't think so. I think he's talking about a visible wall
[8806.87s -> 8808.87s]  But like we have different opinions on it. So that's all right
[8809.43s -> 8821.69s]  That's what I think it is though
[8821.69s -> 8823.69s]  Very clearly that's what it is
[8824.25s -> 8838.62s]  All right got the turn the visuals off and do audio alone
[8840.23s -> 8842.31s]  I don't think that sounds like a fun game to me
[8842.31s -> 8843.51s]  Okay
[8843.51s -> 8851.06s]  Did my speed increase?
[8851.30s -> 8852.98s]  We're going faster
[8852.98s -> 8864.92s]  Where's the red door up here? There it is
[8868.02s -> 8870.26s]  Turn the stream up tweet your actions
[8876.15s -> 8879.43s]  Going down this hall now guys going down this hall i'm going down here
[8886.84s -> 8891.00s]  If I did that I would tweet more than I've tweeted probably in the last five years total
[8891.88s -> 8906.22s]  All right, it's invisible. It's invisible. Whatever it is. It's the invisible thing
[8907.18s -> 8909.16s]  Oh my fuck
[8909.16s -> 8922.73s]  Oh, that sucks
[8922.73s -> 8926.71s]  And they make the burger boy pterodactyl noise
[8927.51s -> 8928.87s]  that like
[8928.87s -> 8930.23s]  I can't even do it
[8930.23s -> 8946.30s]  You know the one knowing that those things are here. Oh, I hate it
[8950.81s -> 8952.81s]  invisible enemies really
[8953.48s -> 8954.94s]  invisible enemies
[8954.94s -> 8959.93s]  I was gonna give you a game of 9.4
[8963.30s -> 8988.01s]  Now it's in 9.3
[8998.44s -> 9002.36s]  All right, we good am I safe I think so I gotta open this though
[9003.08s -> 9010.89s]  Let's go there. How do I get back up?
[9011.29s -> 9013.93s]  How do I get back up?
[9013.93s -> 9020.33s]  Okay, excuse me the streamer asked you a question. How do I get back up?
[9026.55s -> 9030.39s]  Oh, no, it's the five. It's the 5g tower noise
[9032.47s -> 9034.47s]  All right, would you guys put your head?
[9035.19s -> 9037.19s]  Let's say this is the 5g tower
[9037.51s -> 9039.59s]  Would you connect your forehead?
[9040.23s -> 9045.83s]  To the 5g towers tip top like this and stick it on there for 10 seconds. Would you do it?
[9047.99s -> 9050.49s]  No, you wouldn't
[9052.87s -> 9055.59s]  But it's what if but it's so safe why wouldn't why won't you
[9075.86s -> 9078.82s]  You would get powers would you get powers?
[9090.87s -> 9092.87s]  All right, but when you do it
[9093.19s -> 9097.27s]  So you have to hold it there for 10 seconds, but when you do you own that cell tower
[9097.35s -> 9102.07s]  It's now yours and any phone calls and anybody's plans that go through that you get a month
[9103.27s -> 9107.83s]  That's what you get for like you get money a month like for anybody that uses that tower
[9108.79s -> 9110.79s]  Can I like get under here?
[9110.87s -> 9128.23s]  It's tempting
[9128.23s -> 9131.51s]  I probably should have opened that right now. I probably shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that
[9136.54s -> 9140.62s]  Oh my lord. Holy shit. There's a million people. There's no way I was getting out of that one
[9141.34s -> 9158.76s]  with my
[9158.76s -> 9160.76s]  Not your head, but like the tip of your
[9162.33s -> 9164.33s]  Wait, would you just get electrocuted?
[9165.29s -> 9171.21s]  If you just went like
[9171.21s -> 9173.21s]  Yeah, and just placed it on there for one second
[9176.92s -> 9179.88s]  I have not slid at all this whole time i've played this game
[9190.78s -> 9193.58s]  Okay, so i'm seeing a lot of like yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah, sure
[9193.98s -> 9196.54s]  All right. Well the closer you get with your tongue the louder they're like
[9198.30s -> 9206.52s]  Gets
[9206.52s -> 9211.16s]  And you can feel like static electricity like pulling your tongue forward still doing it
[9220.38s -> 9222.38s]  All right, I gotta get in a good spot
[9222.62s -> 9224.62s]  and I gotta get my
[9224.62s -> 9227.11s]  Mortar gun i'm ready
[9227.43s -> 9239.30s]  Activated how much money we talking? I'll tell you in a second
[9239.46s -> 9261.27s]  I'll tell you so how much money we're talking about all the data that goes through the cell phone tower
[9263.08s -> 9268.12s]  Is you get it as you know, people have their cell phone plans. So you get a portion of whatever their cell phone plan is
[9268.92s -> 9272.26s]  Like you do whatever data comes through that tower. How do I get this?
[9273.14s -> 9282.87s]  Are you serious?
[9282.87s -> 9284.87s]  Well, I gotta I can still use it
[9286.60s -> 9301.42s]  Get the health. All right. Well fine. So here's the scenario you get you get five hundred thousand dollars instantly
[9302.14s -> 9303.51s]  but
[9303.51s -> 9304.95s]  by doing that
[9304.95s -> 9308.33s]  What you've just done is you have given yourself a reverse superpower
[9310.63s -> 9318.01s]  Which twice a year it will not this you don't know when two times a year you just violently shit your pants
[9319.05s -> 9322.89s]  Yeah, you get a curse
[9322.89s -> 9326.17s]  You don't know when two times a year. It's random on 365 rolled days
[9326.73s -> 9328.17s]  Could be any time
[9328.17s -> 9330.17s]  It could be one two twice in row
[9330.41s -> 9335.53s]  You get five hundred thousand dollars
[9336.25s -> 9344.44s]  You missed the first part of the scenario. Well, don't worry because none of it matters
[9350.44s -> 9364.81s]  It was a double red meat bread exit
[9366.41s -> 9374.54s]  What the fuck
[9375.72s -> 9399.74s]  Fair it's gonna laugh at me, right? Oh my goodness. We're still back here. I didn't know
[9406.78s -> 9408.78s]  Century going up
[9409.10s -> 9411.10s]  Oh century going up
[9425.51s -> 9438.23s]  Rifle who's still firing at me you
[9438.55s -> 9439.75s]  You
[9439.75s -> 9450.70s]  Stop using the rifle for the small fries. It's my it's one of my favorite weapons and pinpoint accurate
[9456.78s -> 9470.97s]  Boring boring. That's one guy left
[9471.69s -> 9486.28s]  Grenade down here behind me. Someone's behind me
[9487.08s -> 9508.82s]  What's that? All right, get me over there
[9514.78s -> 9517.46s]  Excuse me
[9517.78s -> 9526.34s]  Somebody's gonna laugh my ass. Why did you write laugh my ass up? What'd you do that for? Tell me why?
[9527.67s -> 9531.19s]  Did I say I didn't say anything funny? Did I say something funny? When did I say something funny? When?
[9531.35s -> 9549.32s]  I didn't say anything funny. You got the last hit off. Okay yellow. Uh, i'm in trouble

[10767.22s -> 10769.22s]  And soldier and scout
[10769.46s -> 10772.47s]  It was pretty good
[10773.11s -> 10775.11s]  You know back in my heyday
[10781.30s -> 10784.42s]  I would be number two with three or one on the top rag list
[10785.46s -> 10816.89s]  Did I miss the yellow key?
[10817.45s -> 10832.52s]  Did I not get him it looks like it opens this door opens elsewhere

[10993.03s -> 11018.50s]  Is there an opening that i'm just not seeing because it's blending in or something
[11019.46s -> 11024.62s]  I thought it said don't shoot
[11024.62s -> 11026.62s]  Oh, it's a joke
[11030.28s -> 11033.64s]  Didn't I shoot it i'm confused I thought I shot the damn thing
[11034.52s -> 11049.77s]  Give me a bad aim. I shot it like 15 times

[11082.28s -> 11084.68s]  Go look at the clip. I don't even do whatever I do bend myself
[11085.32s -> 11087.32s]  I don't look at the clip

[11115.90s -> 11117.66s]  Tell me again what I did wrong
[11117.66s -> 11120.94s]  What did I do wrong? I shot it a thousand times
[11121.90s -> 11145.19s]  Okay, I do not go back down

[11411.61s -> 11422.04s]  I can ban away all my problems
[11423.08s -> 11428.26s]  Somebody says hey streamer, you're an idiot ban them

[11652.68s -> 11654.76s]  Best weapon my favorite weapon in the game got it
[11659.82s -> 11670.76s]  This door opens elsewhere, of course
[11675.54s -> 11683.96s]  Oh, I know where it opens
[11683.96s -> 11686.71s]  Get out of here

[11705.66s -> 11726.65s]  Does that mean i'm gonna get the crossbow?
[11730.50s -> 11732.50s]  I would hope so

[11807.85s -> 11812.41s]  Good thing I did that this guy would have collapsed on me. He sneaked. I was sneaking up behind me

[11866.82s -> 11880.42s]  The hatch is open is this the hatch that's down here? That looks like a hatch
[11901.80s -> 11906.79s]  It depends on what you mean by that
[11908.33s -> 11910.33s]  Holy shit

[12218.15s -> 12220.15s]  Holy fuck that was a turn
[12234.84s -> 12259.08s]  Every time you kill one of the guys sounds like you grunting I guess so Jesus let's get the fuck out of me
[12259.08s -> 12261.08s]  I didn't mean to do that
[12263.34s -> 12267.16s]  So can't open that
[12268.12s -> 12277.77s]  Something isn't right

[15238.14s -> 15241.90s]  I okay. This is how stupid I am. I went into steam and I typed into the search bar studio
[15244.68s -> 15249.03s]  Dusk, okay. Oh, it's just me
[15249.43s -> 15253.56s]  Just made by one guy
[15253.56s -> 15258.12s]  Really? It's just me. It's one guy just well not probably not but just david
[15263.19s -> 15264.39s]  developer

[15285.54s -> 15287.54s]  Thank you everybody for your subs. Seriously
[15289.00s -> 15290.68s]  and dark soul, uh

[15295.37s -> 15303.53s]  You deserve it for lydie 10 community subs. Thank you for lydie earlier about 30 minutes ago
[15303.61s -> 15306.01s]  I think I caught it but just want to say thank you again. It's a lot of money
[15307.88s -> 15311.88s]  Malto, thanks for the 500 bits. I have to say my favorite movie quote of all time is i'll be
[15312.52s -> 15314.68s]  Biac from the 1985 the germinator
[15315.56s -> 15319.08s]  It's not a bad one
[15319.08s -> 15320.86s]  Sorry
[15320.86s -> 15325.90s]  And then xion's w a s d. Thanks for the 500 bits. I'm gonna start a riot
[15326.62s -> 15330.22s]  Halo is not better or equal to tf2 xbox
[15330.94s -> 15333.10s]  Back me up against the pc oppressors
[15336.44s -> 15337.48s]  halo
[15337.48s -> 15338.92s]  What is this?
[15341.99s -> 15345.67s]  Halo is greater than and not equal to tf2's xbox
[15346.47s -> 15349.03s]  Well, all the console team fortresses were terrible
[15350.02s -> 15352.97s]  They never received an update
[15353.13s -> 15358.95s]  That's not fair
[15358.95s -> 15362.95s]  There were still glitches in the game where you could insta kill people with a melee attack in xbox
[15363.51s -> 15365.21s]  tf2
[15365.21s -> 15372.38s]  You could store a crit and just insta kill somebody and it was a incredibly simple to do
[15376.23s -> 15378.79s]  Uh, i'll be playing halo though. We'll see if it's any good on pc
[15383.13s -> 15386.33s]  All right, guys, see you tomorrow. Thanks for watching. I gotta get out here. I gotta eat at the store
[15386.97s -> 15388.73s]  Gotta get out of some food
[15388.73s -> 15392.41s]  Dusk is awesome. We'll keep playing tomorrow and see if we can beat it
[15393.22s -> 15394.74s]  Good night. Take care
[15394.74s -> 15444.15s]  See you tomorrow
