[43.77s -> 53.16s]  Secret stream. Well, I'm hitting you with the uh, I'm hitting you with the extreme reverse delay.
[53.88s -> 65.50s]  This is extreme. The sus said Thursday. It's Tuesday. What an extreme reverse delay.
[74.66s -> 81.18s]  Anyways, how are you? Hope you're having a good day. So is there no stream on Thursday? Um,
[82.26s -> 91.00s]  there probably still will be. I don't know. It depends. Does the music sound weird?
[91.32s -> 109.21s]  Uh, shouldn't. Surprise stream. Yeah, technically. Does the music taste weird?
[110.09s -> 118.71s]  But yeah, if you're curious, um, why I turned the stream on, I'm just going to play a game and chill.
[119.35s -> 125.21s]  I think I talked a little bit about a few weeks ago as we went into 2023.
[126.25s -> 132.65s]  I want to do much more stuff like this, but we're just chilling. Doesn't need to be anything crazy
[132.65s -> 136.89s]  going on. Doesn't need to be anything elaborate. I'm just going to play Plants vs. Zombies and
[136.89s -> 141.46s]  Hangout. I think there were a lot of people over the last year or two that have been like,
[141.46s -> 146.02s]  you know, I really miss when he just fucking relaxed and played Plants vs. Zombies.
[148.44s -> 155.74s]  I feel like a lot of people have had that opinion. And I, I join your opinion. I think I kind of
[155.74s -> 164.34s]  missed being able to chill and hang out and just do whatever. So they're coming back. I promise
[164.34s -> 171.14s]  there won't be any McDonald's rants tonight. Well, I can't promise that, but you know,
[175.10s -> 180.34s]  how long are you going to go for? I think that's the other thing too. No, uh, no time limit,
[180.98s -> 186.55s]  no kind of rhyme or reason to anything here. Just going to play a game, hang out, talk.
[187.19s -> 202.39s]  This is going to be 15 hours. No, I don't think I'll ever go over 14. Also too,
[202.39s -> 206.39s]  there's not going to be a cam tonight. I'm going to try some, go back to kind of the way,
[206.47s -> 215.78s]  if you don't know, back before 2020, 2021, 2020, I never did face cam. It was something
[215.78s -> 225.83s]  that was very rare. So we're going to be doing less face cam, but no, I'm just not going away.
[225.83s -> 229.75s]  Let me be really upfront. People be like, wait a minute. Why is he taking the face cam off
[229.75s -> 234.39s]  permanently? No, it's just when I feel like hanging out and chilling, it's not going to be on.
[235.91s -> 241.43s]  That's right. I get to be naked again. It's awesome. You know how a lot don't, I'm not
[241.43s -> 248.74s]  going to rant about anything. It's a chill stream. I've been waiting for the opportunity.
[250.20s -> 257.98s]  No, I'm just kidding. But yeah, well, I don't really have a plan. The plan was, uh, I was in
[257.98s -> 262.14s]  offline chat, just kind of hanging out for a minute and gave a few options. Like let's just
[262.14s -> 270.36s]  play plans for as obvious. I don't think I ever beat this game. Maybe we'll beat it tonight.
[272.79s -> 276.79s]  Maybe I'll play for an hour. Maybe I'll play for four hours. Maybe I'll be here all night,
[278.36s -> 281.72s]  but let's just relax and have some, uh, have some fun.
[284.28s -> 288.97s]  Breath of the Wild, Breath of the Wild is going to, it's going to be funny because
[290.01s -> 297.61s]  it's the first like six Breath of the Wild streams where there's a lot going on. It's like the second
[297.61s -> 302.73s]  part of the Breath of the Wild series is going to be so much more like chilled out and kind of
[302.73s -> 308.04s]  turned down a lot, right? You're going to get to the second half and be like, wow, he must have
[308.04s -> 317.26s]  really, what the fuck I have to do. But anyways, yeah, let's, let's open it up. I hope you guys are
[317.26s -> 324.42s]  doing well. I know this is going to be new for a lot of you, but it's something I wanted to do this
[324.42s -> 333.29s]  year. Spend a lot more time just doing stuff like this. Let's go. Is there anything weird that I
[333.29s -> 342.46s]  need to do? Plans for zombies. It's been so long. Do I have, is this the right version? Like do I,
[342.46s -> 350.46s]  did I get the wrong version? Are you on your iPad? That'd actually be kind of funny.
[350.46s -> 359.32s]  Fuck, this looks old. Well, that's because it is old. It is very old. When did plans for zombies
[359.32s -> 367.61s]  come out? I don't remember. If make your own zombie, what does this mean? I don't know what
[367.61s -> 373.46s]  this means. Make your own zombie. I clicked on this and it was like, I had to like agree to terms.
[373.46s -> 387.10s]  What's this? I had this on my family PC. Yeah. Fix the aspect ratio. Uh, I don't think that's
[387.10s -> 402.70s]  possible. Wait, so I can make a zombie? Is this what they look like when they come down the lanes?
[402.70s -> 419.51s]  Oh, okay. Do I have to unlock these or are they just all available? Just the first zombie with
[419.51s -> 438.98s]  the flag. Oh, okay. Oh dude, look at this. Look at this character creator. I like that. Use plenty
[438.98s -> 445.45s]  of sunflowers. I used to be pretty damn good at this game. I don't think I ever beat it. How long
[445.45s -> 463.42s]  is the campaign? Oh, definitely that. It's like 30 hours. You could probably finish it in one sitting.
[463.42s -> 471.30s]  30 hours. I don't think one sitting, that's a long time. That sounds like a while. Uh, hold on. Let
[471.30s -> 499.77s]  me move my chair. I got a pretty good tea here too. Okay. Oh no. I put my cord underneath it.
[499.77s -> 506.15s]  What are you doing? I'm moving my chair. Yeah. No, no. People are asking. No camp tonight.
[506.15s -> 516.06s]  This is a relaxed night. What should I be wearing? Oh, I got an orange spice tea, by the way.
[516.06s -> 541.03s]  Very smooth clown costume. This song is comfy. I'll do the clown. Oh, these are teeth. Okay.
[541.03s -> 553.11s]  White collar, gold teeth. I think play insane aquarium. I think I did a long time ago.
[553.11s -> 562.79s]  Remember, this is pre-recorded. You might think that. It says probably feel that way.
[562.79s -> 572.30s]  What do we got here? Gold teeth. Okay. It's an AI generated stream. I'm just testing the waters
[572.30s -> 580.31s]  to see if you notice. It's an AI generated stream. I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice.
[583.34s -> 597.58s]  It's an AI generated stream. I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice. I'm thinking this.
[597.58s -> 610.36s]  Uh, I like the gold teeth. They'll stay gold. Hey, just because I'm relaxing doesn't mean I'm
[610.36s -> 621.74s]  not going to be a weird. Oh, that's right. Somebody said this too. The last time I played
[621.74s -> 632.07s]  this game, it was, I couldn't beat the tutorial during the Halloween special from a few years ago.
[632.07s -> 642.57s]  That's right. It's just, there was no attention there at all. Zero, zero attention. So let's see
[642.57s -> 651.72s]  if I can, uh, fix that and see if we can actually beat the first level. That'd be great. This is
[651.72s -> 660.42s]  fine. Be sure you're done creating your Zompatar. If you wish to make any changes,
[660.42s -> 669.54s]  you'll need to start over. So what? Your Zompatar has been saved to your desktop.
[669.54s -> 679.70s]  Why did it do that? It's weird. That's weird. I don't like that. I don't really don't like that.
[679.70s -> 688.57s]  Where is it? Hold on. Is it actually on my desktop? Yeah, it is. That's strange.
[688.57s -> 706.68s]  Okay. Oh yeah. I have to capture the, sorry. The window needs to be captured. There you go.
[706.68s -> 712.76s]  You can't capture this game as a game. It has to be a window. All right. So there it is. Cool.
[712.76s -> 728.42s]  All right, let's go. Make that your Twitch avatar. Oh, this is a replay of the last game that I
[728.42s -> 740.14s]  played. Look at that placement. I can't lose the tutorial. I mean, there's no way, right? How did
[740.14s -> 747.98s]  I lose the tutorial? I should probably turn it up, shouldn't I? No, I'm like actually genuinely
[747.98s -> 758.76s]  asking. How did I lose the tutorial? You can't. There we go. Is that better? Yeah, you put it
[758.76s -> 765.19s]  back here. And you always want to have the sunflowers in the back row. You might remember.
[765.19s -> 769.19s]  Did I actually lose on this level? I cannot believe that. It seems impossible.
[772.95s -> 794.44s]  It was this screen? You lost to one lane. How? You can't. This, ah, this, I forget how cool this
[794.44s -> 799.32s]  game was. I forget how awesome this game was and I forget just how much I was so sad when the second
[799.32s -> 817.21s]  one came up. It's too loud. How's that? Is that better? How is that still too loud? Come on, dude.
[818.01s -> 826.82s]  There we go. Play the YouTube video of you ranting about the in-game currency.
[827.77s -> 832.81s]  The one thing that I remember about Plants vs. Zombies 2 was that. It was the fact that
[832.81s -> 837.29s]  some levels, it was just like, oh yeah, there's like electricity lightning moves.
[837.29s -> 841.21s]  You just put your finger over it and you just destroy every single enemy on the screen.
[841.21s -> 854.26s]  And it was, it cost money to do it. There we go. Make the music and the sound effects the same
[854.26s -> 863.37s]  volume. Okay. We gotta get the perfect, it's gotta be chill. This is not chill. This is chill. This
[863.37s -> 869.88s]  is not chill. I think it's in a good spot. All right, yeah, the sunflowers go in the back row.
[870.44s -> 875.51s]  You guys gotta help me with decisions though, because I know that eventually you can buy
[876.55s -> 888.78s]  things. I don't, you guys probably know a lot more than I do. Yeah, this feels pretty nice,
[888.78s -> 898.38s]  doesn't it? A lot of people probably think this is a joke. Like, ah, no, I like this. This is cool.
[903.74s -> 909.70s]  So I used to do double sunflower, right? It's like kind of overkill, but I used to like it.
[909.70s -> 920.66s]  It was like, yeah, give me the double the power. Some people are against the double sunflower lane,
[920.66s -> 930.12s]  but I always wanted extra power. I'm probably going to continue to do double sunflower.
[931.72s -> 938.87s]  Hey, when is the bit going to end? Oh shit, yeah, you probably, a screamer is going to show up in
[938.87s -> 942.87s]  about one to two minutes, I think. I have it programmed so that like a screamer just goes
[942.87s -> 952.10s]  right in the middle of the screen. How pissed would some of you be if that happened and the
[952.10s -> 962.81s]  stream turned off? I feel like a lot of people would be really mad at me. Do three rows of
[962.81s -> 976.84s]  sunflowers? Nah, now you're just asking too much. Can you ever make the cooldown faster on these?
[977.64s -> 987.30s]  I don't think so, right? This is a chill grandpa stream. Yeah, that's what I like to hear.
[994.01s -> 1003.46s]  Best gamer moment, beating the tutorial. Oh, look, there's our guy. Dude, he was so cool.
[1009.51s -> 1023.42s]  I don't have to do anything else. Oh, I remember this. I support grandfathers across America.
[1025.51s -> 1030.47s]  So is this a lane or is this just the air, like just a small area? I forgot. Didn't know the
[1030.47s -> 1036.92s]  chili pepper is the lane, right? From what I remember. And why does this game have a 3D
[1036.92s -> 1049.26s]  acceleration option? What does that do? It's a three by three square, so like all I remember
[1049.26s -> 1057.48s]  about this is at every convention there were those cones were on everybody's head. If you went to a
[1057.48s -> 1065.62s]  gaming convention between like 2011 to like 2014, it was like that was that was like a fashion
[1065.62s -> 1079.83s]  statement, wearing one of these cones. I feel like you're lying. No, no, I'm going double. I
[1079.83s -> 1097.85s]  got to go double wrong. Come on. I feel like you've said that before. Probably double row.
[1097.85s -> 1119.35s]  Look out for that zombie. I got plenty of time. Don't worry. If Jerma doesn't respond to this,
[1119.35s -> 1123.91s]  then it's pre-recorded. But how do you know that I didn't make sure I specifically addressed
[1123.91s -> 1140.12s]  comments like yours in the pre-recorded video? Look out. What? I got it. Actually, it might be
[1140.12s -> 1143.56s]  kind of funny if I just respond to stuff that's not there. Yeah, maybe I'll do that for a minute
[1143.56s -> 1159.03s]  or so. What's my favorite kind of steak? Um, I'm not really a huge steak guy, but I like it kind
[1159.03s -> 1174.76s]  of a medium medium well. It's like a like a flat kind of iron, flat iron steak. Oh shit. I gotta
[1174.76s -> 1184.86s]  be careful. Oh, come on. I can't get, I cannot have any of my flowers get touched once in the
[1184.86s -> 1203.50s]  first zone. That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it? You're making up stuff. Uh, hold on.
[1204.14s -> 1210.38s]  Is your favorite pizza? Standard pepperoni is pretty much how I like to eat my pizza.
[1213.75s -> 1226.04s]  I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I'm gonna lose. Type mustache. Is that, is that a cheat code or
[1226.04s -> 1231.88s]  something? Look at that placement. Awful. Is it going to give you like unlimited money? I'm not
[1231.88s -> 1254.65s]  going to do that. I wonder how this game gets actually kind of difficult, doesn't it? It gives
[1254.65s -> 1273.08s]  the zombies mustaches. Technically. Yes. Does it add money or anything? I don't want to hold on.
[1273.08s -> 1291.46s]  No, no. Why am I doing that? Save that. I always want to get a row down first. I'm going to do
[1291.46s -> 1320.02s]  double row until I can't. That's the screamer code. You type mustache and it just goes, don't
[1320.02s -> 1338.12s]  you dare. Good guys. I always want to make sure there's at least some one person in each row.
[1338.12s -> 1350.34s]  Please type mustache. No, no. Would I rather eat a burger or a pizza? I think that's an
[1350.34s -> 1354.47s]  impossible question because there are some days where you really feel like a pizza and
[1354.47s -> 1370.17s]  there's some days where you really don't feel like a pizza. I think honestly though,
[1371.90s -> 1377.18s]  if I had to delete one of them, if I had to delete pizza or delete burgers from earth,
[1378.22s -> 1388.81s]  they would just gone. They would just Thanos snapped out. I don't know. What, what, what do
[1388.81s -> 1398.26s]  I care about more? Do I like pizza more than hamburgers? I probably, oh, that's hard.
[1404.49s -> 1408.25s]  Pizza is better. Pizza is better than burgers. I would probably say pizza probably is better than
[1408.25s -> 1414.98s]  burgers in most cases, but if I feel like a burger, like if I really feel like a burger,
[1416.30s -> 1422.26s]  I don't think it can match like the taste of burger. Pizza is very versatile. Burgers are
[1422.26s -> 1436.60s]  versatile too, but I feel like there's a lot you can do with the pizza. If you delete burgers,
[1436.60s -> 1443.74s]  the jazz won't exist anymore. I think they could, they could eat pizza. They would be happy with
[1443.74s -> 1453.06s]  that. Oh, hold on a minute. Am I deleting like beef or just like the, how you make a burger,
[1453.06s -> 1459.98s]  like the bun, the cheese, the Patty, am I deleting beef? Cause I don't, I would not do that. I don't
[1459.98s -> 1478.30s]  think I would do that. No, just burgers. I think I could live with that though. Deleting beef,
[1478.86s -> 1483.62s]  the difficulty you want. I don't think there are other difficulties in this game.
[1486.66s -> 1498.94s]  There he is. I need you to clear your lawn. Use your shovel to dig up those plants.
[1499.90s -> 1508.94s]  Okay. What is it? What purpose is this a serve again? Do an impression. Okay.
[1512.46s -> 1519.37s]  I'm not doing that one. I'm not doing that one either, but here you go.
[1520.09s -> 1532.12s]  There's a chill stream. There's a little weird voices. Hey, I, that's not what I said. All right.
[1532.12s -> 1541.75s]  I remember now. Oh, wait, is this, Oh, wait a minute. That's right. Okay. Was this
[1541.75s -> 1564.39s]  explode or not? Right. Okay. I remember kind of like a puzzle. How's the music this good?
[1565.75s -> 1578.01s]  All these old PopCap games were, I don't, I don't even know what happened. PopCap made
[1578.65s -> 1586.25s]  banger after banger after banger. Oh, yeah. I'm going to get that sometimes.
[1591.53s -> 1593.69s]  Don't let any through. I don't think any will get through.
[1599.98s -> 1604.70s]  What? I have a really important question though. What actually happened to PopCap? Are they still
[1605.58s -> 1612.41s]  doing anything? I mean, uh, Peggle two was the last, God, that had to have been at least five
[1612.41s -> 1619.82s]  plus years ago. Wasn't it? It was all mobile.
[1624.30s -> 1630.22s]  Oh, actually might be in trouble. Yeah. They got bought by you.
[1645.27s -> 1652.57s]  Oh, the garden warfare games. That's right. You know, I actually heard those games were pretty
[1652.57s -> 1669.91s]  fun. They are played them, but I actually liked them. I feel like that's the kind of multiplayer
[1669.91s -> 1673.19s]  first person or third person shooter type game that I probably really actually would like.
[1673.75s -> 1678.52s]  There's a couple of them, right? There's a garden warfare, garden warfare, two garden warfare,
[1679.85s -> 1688.68s]  uh, neighborhood or something. And they're like a few of them. It's very similar to TF2.
[1688.68s -> 1706.68s]  Really? You would be acid bowling. Let me be really, really honest with you though.
[1708.09s -> 1715.91s]  Be real. And I want you to be honest. How many of you, how many of you ones in the chat, if you
[1715.91s -> 1722.07s]  actually can reliably get a strike in bowling, I don't think it's anybody. I don't think anybody
[1722.07s -> 1734.10s]  does. No, you cannot come on. And I'm not, I'm not talking about just a strike. I'm talking about
[1734.10s -> 1740.02s]  like, and it curves across the whole lane and boom blows up all the pins and you can do that
[1740.02s -> 1761.16s]  more than once or twice in a row. I don't, I don't believe you. I can bowl a 60. Is that good? Oh,
[1764.68s -> 1770.89s]  look at how big that is. You can tell the resolution is really small just because of how
[1770.89s -> 1788.63s]  huge that was. That was gigantic. That might've been weird placement, but I think it was good.
[1790.10s -> 1811.16s]  Max is 300. Throw up mashed potatoes versus mac and cheese. Mac and cheese gets to stay.
[1814.52s -> 1824.87s]  Oh, oh, I have to panic here because they can jump over the these things, right? Can they jump over
[1824.87s -> 1844.79s]  these? You can jump over those. Oh, don't you dare. Don't. I have to go flawless. Come on. No.
[1846.22s -> 1856.58s]  No, you have to, I have to be flawless. No, no, no. Oh, this is actually kind of bad.
[1857.96s -> 1863.22s]  No, stop eating that. No. All right. I got to get it. I got to get it right. I can't have a lot
[1863.22s -> 1881.90s]  more happen right now. Oh my God. What do I do? Oh, he can only jump once. All right. Okay.
[1881.90s -> 1890.74s]  How come you panic so easily? I don't know. All right. You're going to jump that.
[1890.74s -> 1913.53s]  Fuck. You're not going to make it faster. I got doubles. Yeah, there we go. All right. We're good.
[1916.15s -> 1919.99s]  Everything has the right amount. I have my explosion. I'm going to use it probably over
[1919.99s -> 1934.28s]  here. I'm going to use it right here. We're good. Okay. We're fine. He's still doing the Elden Ring
[1934.28s -> 1950.39s]  stuff on the weekend. Oh, yeah. 100%. Bro does not have a green thumb. I was actually, uh, so
[1950.39s -> 1956.58s]  stirs playing Neo 2 right now and I just was catching a little bit of it and I was, uh,
[1956.58s -> 1962.18s]  I was laughing because somebody in his chat said, uh, what was it? It was like, dude, you're going
[1962.18s -> 1966.58s]  to do so good. You're going to, it was like a little paragraph. It was just, oh, hey, man,
[1966.58s -> 1970.50s]  don't worry. You're going to learn this game and you're going to make it rain on these enemies
[1970.50s -> 1978.02s]  and do it like a boss. It was, I just loved it. It was so funny. It was like, it was like one of my
[1978.02s -> 1985.56s]  favorite comments. Dude, you're going to make it rain like a boss. It was like all the little tag
[1985.56s -> 1999.45s]  lines from that stream. Like in one comment, it was, I loved it. All right. Maybe the strategy,
[1999.45s -> 2008.12s]  wait. Ooh. Okay. I got to rethink my strategy. Okay. We're not going double lane, but we're
[2008.12s -> 2012.39s]  going to do one row. I'm putting this here because I don't want to deal with this yet.
[2012.39s -> 2023.24s]  It's like Jerma is streaming from his alt account. I mean, I just, honestly, I just kind of wanted,
[2023.24s -> 2029.67s]  I want to do more of these. Not every stream we got to be fucking crazy. You know what I mean?
[2029.67s -> 2053.10s]  You double lane. I'm going to leave the opportunity to, does this dude do more damage than this?
[2053.10s -> 2066.82s]  Cause this is a slow, right? Yeah. Does it do more damage? Yeah. We used to do a lot of these. This
[2066.82s -> 2075.91s]  was something I've been, for the most part, the stream back in like 2016, 2017, 2018. There's a
[2075.91s -> 2084.31s]  lot of stuff like this and I really kind of want to, I really want to bring it back. Cottage.
[2084.87s -> 2097.77s]  Can I do a second lane? I don't think, no. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Should you do a flappy bird
[2097.77s -> 2106.62s]  stream? Maybe I will. What are my thoughts on Greek yogurt? It's good. I will say I don't like
[2106.62s -> 2114.23s]  plain Greek yogurt unless it's put in a swithy or something, but it's good. I like vanilla Greek
[2114.23s -> 2136.01s]  yogurt. Okay. This is, I have to read this. Nobody goes, what are your thoughts on Greek politics?
[2136.57s -> 2143.53s]  Oh, yeah. Let's, let's transition to that. Let's, let's talk about that now. Hey dude. Yeah. What
[2143.53s -> 2158.26s]  are your thoughts on Greek yogurt? Hey, what about Paul? What about Greek politics? How do you feel
[2158.26s -> 2171.29s]  about ancient Greek? I wasn't there. So I don't know. I know this is not, this is not aesthetically
[2171.29s -> 2179.38s]  pleasing. Is it not lined up correctly? They're haphazardly placed. I know I can do better.
[2188.25s -> 2199.18s]  Every lane needs one of these. I wanted you to jump over that. Exactly what I wanted.
[2199.74s -> 2210.17s]  Fell into my trap. Stupid. I don't think you can ever take this off. I really don't. I think it's
[2210.17s -> 2231.26s]  way too important. It's overpriced though. Oh, I think 150 to be able to clear potentially
[2232.70s -> 2244.17s]  a half dozen enemies. I think it's pretty good. It's also instant too. This makes me want to play
[2244.17s -> 2263.26s]  insane aquarium. It really does. That game is so good. It's not even funny. What are your
[2263.26s -> 2276.70s]  thoughts on wireless toilets? What does that mean? Like you flush the toilet with your phone?
[2277.50s -> 2287.53s]  I don't understand. What an extra step that doesn't need to be there.
[2289.03s -> 2293.11s]  Oh, I got a flush. Hold on. Let me open up the app and then go to like wait for it to load and then
[2293.11s -> 2303.34s]  touch flush on the app. I don't know. Sometimes I like the way that like tech is going. Why do I
[2303.34s -> 2308.97s]  feel like that that's something that would happen? Well, you don't understand. You see,
[2308.97s -> 2333.27s]  it's on your phone. If you have wi-fis out, I can't flush my toilet. This is why we hold onto this.
[2335.35s -> 2353.99s]  You know what my favorite item in the game was? The triple shooter. I always want to eat people,
[2353.99s -> 2367.11s]  right? It takes like a minute or so to chew them up. Garbage don't use it.
[2367.11s -> 2379.06s]  Why is my game lagging? Yeah, that seems like you think this is expensive. This is way too
[2379.06s -> 2398.01s]  expensive, I think. Yeah, I'm keeping the original crew here. Copper's good. Why can your PC not
[2398.01s -> 2409.94s]  handle this? What's your favorite veggie? This is the first stream I've ever been to. That's an
[2409.94s -> 2423.50s]  actually really important question to ask. Um, probably broccoli. Mayonnaise. Yeah, my favorite
[2423.50s -> 2440.42s]  vegetable is mayonnaise. Broccoli's great. I actually, I like raw broccoli. I actually prefer
[2440.42s -> 2454.18s]  raw broccoli to cooked. I like the snap. Or maybe, maybe very, very like steamed very slightly.
[2454.18s -> 2473.08s]  Come on. Yes. I don't really like really cooked broccoli. It kind of falls apart and it turns into
[2473.08s -> 2478.76s]  weird mush. Especially if it's, I don't know, I don't like mushy broccoli. I much prefer cooked
[2478.76s -> 2506.63s]  broccoli. I like it gently cooked. All right, now we go blue. Prepare with, you know, put a nut here.
[2507.03s -> 2525.64s]  Prepare. It's kind of funny because I prefer raw carrots too. I prefer most of the vegetables raw.
[2527.80s -> 2550.26s]  Carrots raw. Broccoli raw. What else? Radishes. Just kind of clean them up. Eat them. Yeah. Is it
[2550.26s -> 2554.33s]  gonna work out or what? I don't want to use this right now, but if I have to, I will.
[2555.61s -> 2567.11s]  I'm actually not a, I don't really like potatoes. Have I talked about my kind of
[2567.11s -> 2579.02s]  love-hate relationship with potatoes? Baked potato is not really that appetizing to me at all.
[2579.02s -> 2597.03s]  That's an L take. Yeah, that's okay though. All right, this is the big one.
[2599.03s -> 2627.75s]  Whatever you say, broccoli boy. That's pretty clean. Ooh, this is the double shooter, isn't it?
[2628.63s -> 2655.86s]  Risk it on a baked potato? That's an AI strategy. I don't think so. What the hell are you guys
[2655.86s -> 2664.95s]  writing for business? Oh, it's a dream. Okay. I was like, what should I do? What happened?
[2665.59s -> 2672.58s]  Something about this loading screen. It doesn't like, uh, definitely this. And I'm, I'll tell you,
[2672.58s -> 2685.70s]  people are going to be like, bro, settle down. This is a bad idea. Let's see. Is this the first
[2685.70s -> 2711.19s]  loss of the evening? Is it a bad idea? Each one, each row has to have one of these. Oh,
[2711.91s -> 2738.26s]  oh, this could have been a huge mistake. Pretty greedy. It is, but it's all right.
[2738.26s -> 2747.50s]  So much greed. Yeah. It's a lot of greed. I'm thinking about going even further with it.
[2747.50s -> 2786.17s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. There it is. All right. I'm in a good spot. The love of God,
[2786.17s -> 2793.78s]  goddess Athena, please purchase a chomper for the love of God. I love how you, you clarify
[2793.78s -> 2813.90s]  goddess Athena, just in case we were, uh, we weren't sure. All right. Good. I'm glad he's there.
[2813.90s -> 2839.51s]  All right. I've got my two rows. I'm good. I ain't fucking around there. Just love of God,
[2839.51s -> 2851.10s]  goddess Athena. You're going to make it rain like a boss. Once you figure it out,
[2851.10s -> 2882.62s]  we're doing fine. Everything's good. The double shooter. All right. Good. We've got our base here.
[2882.62s -> 2898.50s]  Now we go with the freeze. I've got my wave one coming. This is not gaming. You need to be sipping
[2898.50s -> 2951.26s]  on a big gulp. True. Worth it. Look at all. This is clean. Look at this. This is very nice.
[2951.26s -> 2966.01s]  What does it say? Downloaded vampire survivors on your recommendation.
[2966.90s -> 2973.16s]  Now characters like music will play on my phone. I deleted it. You just made this up.
[2973.80s -> 2994.18s]  Hey, if you don't mind, could you please type mustache real quick?
[2995.14s -> 3011.06s]  Yeah, let me type in mustache. No, don't do that. That's stupid. Nothing's getting by.
[3011.70s -> 3034.02s]  All right. I'm ready. Is there anything missing in this row? I need something, right?
[3036.39s -> 3042.54s]  I'm going to wait for 200. Every row is protected. Every row is good to go.
[3043.34s -> 3056.17s]  I've got all kinds of explosive everywhere. Everything is good. I'm going to hold this.
[3058.17s -> 3078.76s]  Wait, wait. Easy. Simple. All right. Now that's essentially the tutorial. The tutorial's over.
[3078.76s -> 3087.72s]  Hello. We're about to launch an all out attack on your house. Sincerely, zombie.
[3087.72s -> 3098.23s]  No, it's another one of these. I actually am really not good at these levels,
[3098.95s -> 3118.92s]  but I'll try. Let me assess the situation first. Okay. Okay. Obviously they just,
[3118.92s -> 3141.11s]  they don't go off the screen, right? They just kind of stack. Every row needs something.
[3149.02s -> 3175.26s]  Oh, chopper row. Right here. Have I ever used this thing? Thank you, goddess Athena.
[3196.74s -> 3216.47s]  Yeah. I got an orange twice. I might pick another one too. Do you play Hades? Yeah, I, I, I beat it
[3216.47s -> 3222.90s]  once or twice, right? But I didn't really, that's like saying I beat Binding of Isaac because I
[3222.90s -> 3230.60s]  killed mom's heart once. Right. That's not accurate, but I did complete the game in quotes.
[3231.24s -> 3270.82s]  Play it fully then immediately. This is a victory. Play the Sims. I'll probably go back to it at
[3270.82s -> 3294.55s]  some point. I almost have too much stuff. I got three bombs. They're just waiting a party.
[3294.55s -> 3303.29s]  Do you think you can get, I don't remember how much was in the game. Cause this is the last of,
[3303.29s -> 3308.97s]  how many zones are there? All right. Don't go too crazy here. I don't want to waste all these.
[3309.61s -> 3336.18s]  These are, Oh, that's right. There's a bonus. There are the bonus stages.
[3336.18s -> 3345.61s]  Hey dude, I love you. Can you type mustache real quick? Yeah. Type it real quick.
[3347.35s -> 3349.19s]  All right. That's a really long word.
[3355.72s -> 3362.94s]  Okay. Pretty long. I can't even place anything. There's no, I got to wait till something dies
[3362.94s -> 3387.80s]  like that. This isn't even the big wave. I mean, you might as well just replace these with better
[3387.80s -> 3424.60s]  ones. I'm ready to pop this. Oh, that's right. Nighttime. I forgot about nighttime. Yeah. Nighttime
[3424.60s -> 3441.75s]  you ha you can't use plants. You have to use the mushrooms. Uh-huh. So are they limited or I forget
[3441.75s -> 3456.74s]  how it works. So wait, I can still do this. Can I? These, wait, this is, I don't remember.
[3457.38s -> 3465.77s]  What do I do? No, I can use those. Can I? All right. Okay. All right. So let me do,
[3466.49s -> 3486.23s]  I definitely want to bring you, bring you, you, you. Yeah, they work. Yeah. Okay. Um, just get,
[3486.87s -> 3519.03s]  from what I remember, you just got to get these out quick, bro. But I'm fine. It's really short
[3519.03s -> 3539.00s]  range. That's okay. I'll just make sure that this thing does. This bro has no idea. I know what I'm
[3539.00s -> 3556.09s]  doing. Just wait till I get my full row. So these dude, these are just a deterrent from me. It's,
[3556.09s -> 3581.42s]  they can go right through these, right? Can they be dug up? Okay. There we go. You got through?
[3582.62s -> 3635.32s]  All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ooh, money. Okay. Oh, his pants, his pants come down.
[3635.40s -> 3642.87s]  Oh, right. No. Oh, I thought his, no, he drops his new, I thought his pants came down. I was like,
[3642.87s -> 3649.53s]  oh, he's like, oh, my pants. And then I saw the underwear. I didn't really look at, I thought I
[3649.53s -> 3674.58s]  didn't look behind the newspaper. Bro, you must be high as fuck. No, I'm fine. I want one of these
[3674.58s -> 3701.06s]  in every lane. It was a little sloppy, but I think it's fine. I still have the, the bombs here.
[3705.48s -> 3728.63s]  I see this. I see this as an, I see this as an issue. Don't worry. You're doing everything
[3728.63s -> 3734.79s]  wrong. If I was doing everything wrong, how did I just beat the level without a single lawnmower
[3734.79s -> 3760.46s]  being used flawlessly? There we go. Small sun at first and normal sun later. Hey, you've collected
[3760.46s -> 3771.26s]  $270 in coins and you collect 750. I'll sell you something really neat. You want to make it big in
[3771.26s -> 3778.94s]  the plants versus zombies world. You need to get it together. Jump. Okay. So should I just go all
[3778.94s -> 3806.60s]  mushroom? I'm going to try it. This is probably dumb, but I'm doing it. That's not bad. You should
[3806.60s -> 3836.20s]  play slots. I don't think I'm going to do that. Double row. I'm doing double row. So it's two
[3836.20s -> 3844.58s]  spaces. Okay. Three squares. I just found a shard of bone in a sausage I was eating. Holy shit.
[3844.58s -> 3857.48s]  Careful. Be careful. Somebody just said, I think he's watching a long play and commentating.
[3858.44s -> 3865.19s]  I was just sitting there watching a game play. I got my arms behind my back, like by my head,
[3865.19s -> 3885.26s]  just sitting here. That's exactly what he's doing. When's your next physical? I actually
[3885.26s -> 3896.17s]  probably really should get one. Not to get too depressing or real or whatever, but I kind of
[3896.17s -> 3904.57s]  hit a point a year or two ago with all the medical shit. I kind of just was like, fuck whatever.
[3905.61s -> 3918.10s]  And I just, not that I stopped going, but I had so many, back in like 20, I want to say 2018,
[3918.10s -> 3927.21s]  2019, I had probably, I don't even know how many. I was like scanned a fucking hundred times. Like
[3927.21s -> 3932.04s]  almost every single part of my body was checked. And in my brain, it's almost like, you know what,
[3932.04s -> 3939.08s]  I spent so much time with the doctor in like 2018 through 2020 that they scanned everything.
[3940.52s -> 3946.04s]  So that would be, I think I'm all right for a little while. It's always a good idea.
[3947.32s -> 3962.90s]  Get checked up on. I shouldn't read this, but I'm going to. No, I mean, it was, hold on,
[3962.90s -> 3965.86s]  hold on, hold on. I can't, I'm supposed to, hold on. Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is important.
[3966.74s -> 3993.24s]  I actually like this room. It's cheap. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
[3993.32s -> 4000.54s]  come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Damn it. Oh, this is bad. This is actually bad.
[4001.67s -> 4006.39s]  Oh, I'm in trouble now. I'm in real big trouble. I'm in big trouble right now. I don't know what
[4006.39s -> 4020.42s]  to do. I'm in huge trouble right now. I'm in big trouble. Uh oh. It's okay. It's all right.
[4020.42s -> 4027.53s]  I fucked it up. It's all right. It's okay. Everything's fine. How did I not have anything
[4027.53s -> 4050.39s]  in this whole row? All right. I really thought I could arm it fast enough, but I couldn't.
[4051.03s -> 4100.87s]  This run is dead. No, it's not. I should have took the bomb. I think that'll be armed. Yeah,
[4100.87s -> 4125.10s]  I think I'm all right. No. Oh, what did I do? I think I really fucked that up big time.
[4125.74s -> 4156.63s]  Wait, what do you read the message? All right. I got to pay attention here. There's a, all right,
[4156.63s -> 4164.28s]  there's a walnut in front of everything. Yeah, we're good. I lost the lawnmower. That kind of
[4164.28s -> 4185.08s]  sucks. Are your late night streaming issues fixed now? I got to be really honest. I have no idea
[4185.08s -> 4193.16s]  what the hell is going on. Those of you that don't know, randomly sometimes between like seven and
[4193.16s -> 4201.24s]  eight o'clock my internet would just die. I died. I'd never figured it out. There was never an
[4201.24s -> 4206.54s]  answer. There was never a reason. It could have been Twitch. It could have been my connection to
[4206.54s -> 4237.16s]  Twitch. It's really possible. It's fumes that can pass through screen doors. Is this any good? I'm
[4237.16s -> 4244.31s]  focusing way too much on this. It's making me save too much money. I don't like it. How many
[4244.31s -> 4256.36s]  squares forward does it do? Shit. I wanted that here like four. So like one, like one, two, three.
[4256.36s -> 4271.78s]  I should put it like here. One, two, three, four. Who's your favorite actor? I kind of think that's
[4271.78s -> 4283.69s]  impossible to answer because I really don't know. This is a better start than last time. I thought
[4283.69s -> 4301.14s]  they could shoot down the whole lane. It should be a better start. What's your favorite plant in
[4301.14s -> 4320.42s]  the game? The triple shooter. All right. So I want to put this thing here. That's one, two, three,
[4320.42s -> 4341.90s]  four. Okay. Why is this a fake stream? No. What are you talking about? All right. Right here.
[4344.62s -> 4350.55s]  How much damage does this do relative to everything else? I'm very concerned about it.
[4351.19s -> 4366.36s]  Uh oh. That's why. This shoots through screen doors. All right. No more of these.
[4367.00s -> 4375.40s]  Got that. Good. If you could be any plant from Plants vs. Zombies, who would you be?
[4376.36s -> 4383.48s]  Um, no, probably the Walnut. I feel like you're really strong. Or I don't know,
[4383.48s -> 4394.49s]  maybe one of these mushrooms. They're pretty cool. Who is saying these messages? I don't know. You
[4394.49s -> 4411.21s]  are writing them. You are writing them. There's a lot of messages that go by. Okay. I want one of
[4411.21s -> 4422.10s]  these in each lane. Now we're doing freezing T-shooters down here on every row. I don't want
[4422.10s -> 4431.21s]  to hear how it's a bad strategy. Oh, we're not going to have enough time to do that. Never mind.
[4431.21s -> 4443.77s]  What time is it? It is 8, 18 p.m. Pacific time. We're good.
[4448.49s -> 4464.70s]  I think this is fine, right? What time is it in ancient Greece? Well, you're asking what time is
[4464.70s -> 4473.10s]  it in Greece right now? And I don't think I'd even answer that if I tried. Could I even answer that?
[4473.10s -> 4486.70s]  Let's see. Greece is Pacific time. What is, like, London is, what, eight hours ahead?
[4487.62s -> 4497.54s]  Ten hours ahead right now? No, what time is it in ancient Greece? What does that even mean?
[4499.29s -> 4506.86s]  What does that mean? Is an ancient Greece Greece? Wouldn't it be? It would be the same time.
[4510.81s -> 4518.25s]  Why would the time change? It's not like time. Was ancient Greece on a, like, four-hour clock?
[4518.25s -> 4531.27s]  What are you talking about? Ooh, seven seeds. Should I do it? Why not? Now it's 5,000.
[4531.83s -> 4553.50s]  What about the continental shift? I don't know. What about the continental shift? I actually like
[4553.50s -> 4571.08s]  this. I'm going to use it. I think I like this setup. It's a lot cheaper. Well, ancient Greece
[4571.08s -> 4583.22s]  would be in the past. That's right. That's true. Who's your favorite ancient Greek philosopher?
[4583.22s -> 4588.10s]  Oh, that's easy. Any of the ones that have their arm up and they're wearing, like, a big,
[4588.10s -> 4591.54s]  you know, they're wearing, like, a toga and their arm is up and it looks like they're,
[4591.54s -> 4598.65s]  like, almost singing, like, as they're talking. Who is that? Like, they have the big elaborate
[4598.65s -> 4604.36s]  arm is up. They're like, oh, like, there's like a big elaborate arm up in the air. Like,
[4604.36s -> 4618.68s]  they're, like, presenting something. Who is that? All of them. Yeah, that's Roman. That's okay.
[4618.68s -> 4642.62s]  I know this is risky, but it's going to work. It worked. That was dumb, but whatever. Okay,
[4642.62s -> 4665.78s]  okay. Don't, don't do that. Get up. Nice. Okay, good. Not a bad thought. I just gotta,
[4665.78s -> 4680.63s]  I gotta get some walnuts down. Give me a good toothbrush strat. Uh, don't go too hard. A lot
[4680.63s -> 4684.23s]  of people like brush the fuck out of their mouth and it's just like, dude, yes, you're going way
[4684.23s -> 4693.26s]  too hard. You want small circular motions on the teeth and don't just like, don't just grind out
[4693.26s -> 4724.68s]  your gums and shit. Don't do that. All right, we're good with this. I need something here.
[4724.68s -> 4746.02s]  I need something here. I think that'll do it. Don't you dare kill that. That was expensive.
[4746.02s -> 4757.54s]  Don't kill that. This feels like one of those phone game ads where someone's intentionally
[4757.54s -> 4763.38s]  playing bad. Yeah, you used that one a few days ago. That one doesn't work two times in a row.
[4764.39s -> 4768.63s]  I see. Yeah, you said that a few days ago. I don't don't work two times in a row.
[4768.63s -> 4815.59s]  Give me a hundred. It's kind of like a Minecraft zombie. It's your opinion on blue cheese. I think
[4815.59s -> 4821.13s]  it's one of the best things in the world. Genuinely. It's one of the best things in the
[4821.13s -> 4836.49s]  world. People really hate it, but they love it. I don't know. I feel like people give blue cheese
[4836.49s -> 4843.88s]  a really bad rap, but they eat other shit that's way grosser. That blue cheese, it's, that's
[4843.88s -> 4863.50s]  absolutely disgusting while they're drinking like kombucha. Really? Hey, to each their own,
[4863.50s -> 4871.82s]  whatever. If you don't like it, you don't like it. I think blue cheese goes on. It goes well
[4871.82s -> 4887.29s]  with a lot of stuff. Does every row have one of these? No, it does now. Am I safe here? I think
[4887.29s -> 4899.93s]  this is okay. All right. This is a good setup. Buffalo and blue cheese. If you would ask me,
[4899.93s -> 4905.40s]  if you say, Hey dude, what, I've probably said this before, but whatever. If you asked me, Hey,
[4905.40s -> 4914.62s]  what is the best flavor in the world? The best taste in the world? I would probably say
[4916.23s -> 4923.90s]  blue cheese and hot sauce together is probably the greatest sensation on earth.
[4925.59s -> 4929.03s]  Like blue cheese and buffalo chicken, like buffalo chicken with blue cheese.
[4930.07s -> 4936.55s]  I don't, I don't think there's anything that tastes better than that to me. It's just like,
[4936.55s -> 4943.78s]  it's the best tasting thing in the world. I think that, or if I don't know, I'm trying to,
[4943.78s -> 4951.74s]  how can I rank this? A really good piece of salmon. And I'm talking top tier restaurant
[4951.74s -> 4965.58s]  salmon. That's close. Roasted garlic. Very, very close. Oh, cool. I don't know. Blue cheese and
[4965.58s -> 4974.94s]  buffalo chicken, or just that blue cheese and hot sauce flavor. I just don't, when I, okay,
[4975.50s -> 4987.11s]  let's talk. So pizza. Hold on. He's talking. Okay. So they can come out of the ground,
[4987.11s -> 5008.84s]  right? Yeah. Wait. Oh, I just have to actually click them. I'll just start with this. I get,
[5008.84s -> 5026.01s]  I'm a click master. No one's getting by. You know, I'll do this. I'll put them at the very end,
[5026.01s -> 5044.73s]  just in case something happens, something crazy. Don't ask me why I'm clearing all these. Is there
[5044.73s -> 5054.30s]  a benefit to this? Whatever. I'll do it with my, just with my hand. He's been hardened by years of
[5054.30s -> 5070.78s]  iPad gaming. This kind of is a lot of iPad games. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean. No, iPad games
[5070.78s -> 5076.36s]  have come a really long way. You got to give them at least a little bit of credit. Come on.
[5076.36s -> 5094.09s]  Are you on the toilet? No, not, but get rid of those grapes. Is there even a big wave?
[5094.89s -> 5131.94s]  No, I got this. Dude, you installed the wrong aim lab. I feel like this is pretty good. All right.
[5131.94s -> 5157.26s]  Here we go. I don't need anything. Nobody does better than me. Oh, cool. Oh, speaking of iPad
[5157.26s -> 5165.18s]  games, the, the pine tar poker dev, uh, was really, really nice on Twitter. They were like,
[5165.18s -> 5173.22s]  Hey, you've mentioned pine tar poker. Oh shit. Um, it seems like you're really cool, dude. Uh,
[5173.22s -> 5205.98s]  I like the mushrooms. How good is this? Is there no audio? This should be. How far does this go?
[5205.98s -> 5216.62s]  Is this a whole lane or is it, do they have to touch it or something? They have to touch it.
[5220.94s -> 5229.77s]  Don't you dare kill that. Come on. I need to do this. Hurry. Come on. Come on. What the fuck
[5229.77s -> 5249.06s]  are you doing? Okay. We're good. Sound effects are a little loud. This is bad. Are they fine?
[5249.06s -> 5258.87s]  Okay. So this should go up front then. Should this go in the front row?
[5275.90s -> 5282.78s]  The crunching noises are loud. I don't know if I can turn those specifically down. This is a problem.
[5290.71s -> 5293.99s]  The one time use. Oh shit. I thought he was, I thought he was just going to start walking
[5293.99s -> 5298.36s]  around the battlefield, like attacking people. Okay. Nevermind. All right. I get it. I get it.
[5298.36s -> 5315.21s]  That was a pretty big waste. Yeah, it was. It's all right. We get what this guy does.
[5315.21s -> 5340.79s]  What the hell do you do? Are you just wrong? You're just wrong. That thing actually. Okay.
[5340.79s -> 5348.20s]  Think about it like this. That's 75 cents to make somebody turn around. I actually like that.
[5349.43s -> 5393.18s]  I'm going to hold it. The bed's fine.
[5414.39s -> 5423.56s]  Up there. All right. I'm ready to use it. What, uh, which lane should I use it on? That's the
[5423.56s -> 5431.88s]  question. Where's the, I need somebody who runs up here, right? Oh shit. Wait a minute. Wait a
[5431.88s -> 5437.03s]  minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. I'm going to do
[5437.03s -> 5461.93s]  bomb right here. All right. That worked out. Get out of here. Dude, you're a strategic genius.
[5465.26s -> 5487.51s]  I'm okay. I'm okay. Ooh, actually someone did say that. Well, I didn't read that shit.
[5487.51s -> 5491.03s]  All he's saying. Nobody said that. Nobody said that. Somebody in chat said, actually somebody
[5491.03s -> 5516.79s]  didn't say that. I feel like every single loadout has to have this. What do you guys think?
[5516.79s -> 5529.53s]  Do mushrooms only? I think that's what's about to happen. Is this your first time playing it?
[5529.53s -> 5536.15s]  Uh, I played it a long time ago. I think I got like the third or fourth world. I don't think I
[5536.15s -> 5542.41s]  ever finished it. Maybe I did. It's been a long time. I'll try this. So these things are long
[5542.41s -> 5558.25s]  range and they duck down when they get close. Oh shit. This might be bad. I love how cheap the
[5558.25s -> 5571.34s]  mushrooms are though. All right. This one's going to be hard. I gotta be, I gotta prepare this one.
[5571.34s -> 5587.38s]  I should have brought the grave thing. Yeah, this is going to be a problem. I think I can do it still.
[5587.38s -> 5617.08s]  Restart? No, I don't have to restart. I think I'm fine. You gonna play anything else tonight?
[5617.08s -> 5630.60s]  Um, I don't know. I'm kind of just going until, you know, just whenever. This new thing of,
[5630.60s -> 5635.62s]  I talked about it before earlier on the stream, but a lot of you showed up a little bit after I
[5635.62s -> 5646.47s]  talked about it. But chill out streams are going to be a lot more frequent. I kind of miss them.
[5646.47s -> 5659.03s]  I like just kind of hanging out. Doesn't have to be crazy every time. We're going to get a rock
[5659.03s -> 5670.62s]  outbreak. What about the speed runs? Hey, you're talking, I'm sorry, but you're talking to the
[5670.62s -> 5677.77s]  seventh place Bob the Builder PlayStation one speed runner. Just remember who you're talking to
[5677.77s -> 5700.47s]  when you approach me. How much damage these really do. This is really bad because I got no
[5700.47s -> 5730.63s]  opportunity for these. This lane I don't like. I should, I need to put a walnut here. Do you play
[5730.63s -> 5735.96s]  magic or anything? I'm excited for grotto beasts. Um, I'm not really, I wasn't really like a card
[5735.96s -> 5741.38s]  game fan or anything. And it's interesting because the grotto beast is sort of a,
[5742.34s -> 5750.58s]  I mentioned it a little bit briefly, but it's like, it's like a decade of stream references
[5750.58s -> 5758.36s]  and like YouTube references and stuff. And originally it was no game. It was just,
[5758.36s -> 5761.96s]  oh, maybe we fun to kind of do like, whoa, you can open up and get like a holographic
[5761.96s -> 5766.44s]  glue man or something like that. That was like an interesting concept to me. Um, like just like a
[5766.44s -> 5774.90s]  physical card, just trading just for fun, just merch, right? Um, but then we got this game
[5774.90s -> 5780.04s]  designer who is everything. He just like, Oh, what a thought about this and this and this. It's like,
[5780.04s -> 5789.59s]  Holy shit, this is actually trying to be like really, really cool. So hopefully a lot of you
[5789.59s -> 5795.18s]  guys like it. If you don't buy, you know, it's no pressure, right? But it's definitely one of
[5795.18s -> 5805.69s]  those projects that it's been kind of a long time coming. I know people, you know, Hey, do I have
[5805.69s -> 5812.62s]  to like, no, do I have to like play magic, the gathering type games to care? That's not necessarily
[5812.62s -> 5818.06s]  the intention. It's just, I've always thought of years and years and years ago. Um, it was like,
[5818.06s -> 5822.70s]  what if, what if we did like cards or something, like get like a bunch of artists to do it and a
[5822.70s -> 5827.82s]  bunch of cards and you can open them as packs. And it was like a kind of a fleeting thought years ago
[5830.30s -> 5841.59s]  and decided to sort of kind of capitalize on it and just do it. Yeah, there's a game component.
[5842.23s -> 5846.47s]  If you just want to get packs to do it, if you want to get the starter kit and just be able to
[5846.47s -> 5855.54s]  have it, it was in my brain, it was merch that was, Oh no, where can we get some more t-shirts? Can
[5855.54s -> 5859.62s]  we get some more of this more of that? I'm just thinking, what about just like a bunch of cards
[5859.62s -> 5865.85s]  with a bunch of references and shit? I feel like it'd be fun. There are 200 cards. I think there's
[5865.85s -> 5870.57s]  like over a hundred cards that have some type of screen reference, a screen character on them.
[5879.50s -> 5894.89s]  The NFTs? No, it's more akin to like Pokemon than it is like an NFT or like, you know,
[5894.89s -> 5916.30s]  Magic the Gathering or something. I got too cocky. I got too cocky with like a thousand gulls.
[5917.82s -> 5938.36s]  I think I'm all right. Oh, do it. Shit. I missed it. I missed it. No, I don't know what to do. I'm
[5938.36s -> 5961.32s]  freaking out. He just completely blew it. No, I didn't. I'm fine. I mean, the end got a little
[5961.32s -> 5970.87s]  messed up, but it's all right. You think Grotto Beast will be competitive? I don't know. I mean,
[5970.87s -> 5977.10s]  that wasn't really the intention. It was just like some fun merch for people to collect if they
[5977.10s -> 5985.27s]  wanted to. And the way it stands out right now is we have, there's a starter kit that'll have two
[5985.27s -> 5990.18s]  decks in it with like some dice and some other cool stuff. And when that, when that actually gets
[5990.18s -> 5995.11s]  time to kind of talk about it, I'll go into way more detail, but each booster pack is going to
[5995.11s -> 6003.61s]  have one guaranteed rare and one guaranteed hollow. So you'll be able to kind of, if you want,
[6003.61s -> 6010.15s]  it's just so cool. There's like a hollow and a rare in every single pack. Years ago, there was
[6010.15s -> 6015.53s]  this, like I mentioned earlier of like, imagine if there was like a holographic blue man that you
[6015.53s -> 6020.46s]  could get in a card pack. That was like interesting to me. It was like funny to me in a way. Like,
[6020.46s -> 6039.32s]  wow, that's cool. I actually kind of don't, this thing's okay. Because there was always the question
[6039.32s -> 6046.79s]  of how would people in the community play with each other? Not really sure, but I'm sure some
[6046.79s -> 6050.98s]  people maybe, I mean, I'm sure a lot of you guys at this point know each other. I think there's a
[6050.98s -> 6056.97s]  lot of people in real life that know each other just over the years, but that's, you know, that's
[6056.97s -> 6074.18s]  just extra awesome shit that's on top of the project. What is this? It mobilizes all zombies
[6074.18s -> 6093.75s]  on the screen. Is it worth it? I'll try it. Oh, what the hell am I thinking? This is, you have to
[6093.75s -> 6102.68s]  have this in every single loadout. I really think so. Oh shit, the grave buster. I have to rely on
[6102.68s -> 6109.54s]  this though. I need it. What's the prices? How much would the cards be? We're trying to make it so,
[6110.78s -> 6117.00s]  because it's, it's tricky because I really don't want to charge some crazy amount of money for
[6117.00s -> 6124.63s]  this stuff, but because it's a, it's a limited amount of cards and we have to essentially
[6124.63s -> 6131.27s]  kind of commission up the manufacturing. We're trying to make it affordable, but also, I mean,
[6131.27s -> 6147.02s]  I don't want to just kind of blow up my bank account. I think this is okay. I'll go with this.
[6147.02s -> 6153.72s]  There are some prices we're floating around at and I'm trying to keep it reasonable if I can.
[6153.72s -> 6165.34s]  Is it going to be under a hundred? Yes. For the starter kit starter kit has, um, I believe I don't,
[6165.34s -> 6170.15s]  and I don't want to give any wrong information, but starter kit is going to have two full decks
[6170.15s -> 6180.70s]  in it. I think a couple of booster packs in the starter kit, some placemat, some dice, custom dice,
[6180.70s -> 6189.64s]  and it's, it will be under a hundred dollars. I can promise you that well, well under a hundred
[6189.64s -> 6203.32s]  dollars, not like 99, 99. Oh yeah, guys, it's going to be, it's going to be well under a hundred
[6203.32s -> 6233.62s]  bucks for the starter kit. Yeah. Like 97, 98, of course, like 90, 99, 98 and trying to price this
[6233.62s -> 6241.62s]  stuff too. We've had tons of conversations about it. I don't want to make it so expensive that
[6241.62s -> 6246.89s]  people just can't fucking afford it. It's like, wait, should the starter, how much should the
[6246.89s -> 6256.71s]  packs be like 15 bucks? 20? No, I don't want to do that. Even though like even with manufacturing
[6256.71s -> 6273.08s]  costs included and everything, what does that do? What is going on here? I need the explosion. I
[6273.08s -> 6283.58s]  don't know what to do. See, this is a crutch for me. I'm just, okay, no, that's fine. See how much
[6283.58s -> 6299.98s]  I need that? Imagine that wasn't in the loadout. And there are a limited amount of them. So we
[6299.98s -> 6307.26s]  don't really have, oh, it's this store and it's just the way to have some kind of agreement where
[6307.26s -> 6311.58s]  it's just going to be printed forever. That's not really the case right now. We're trying to gauge
[6311.58s -> 6316.70s]  how, how many people actually want to buy it or how many people actually would purchase something
[6316.70s -> 6319.82s]  like that. Because it's asking a lot. It is. And I understand that. And I want to make sure you guys
[6319.82s -> 6328.09s]  get that too. That even if I try to get like a starter kit somewhere in that, like under a
[6328.09s -> 6331.93s]  hundred dollar range, that's still a lot of fucking money to ask somebody to be like, hey,
[6332.73s -> 6339.90s]  spend like a bunch of fucking money on this thing. I don't want people to feel like it's
[6339.90s -> 6344.49s]  not worth it or something. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the router piece.
[6345.13s -> 6357.14s]  And the idea is to make it so, to make sure people can get them if you want them. Perfect
[6357.14s -> 6360.26s]  opportunity. Can you tell me why that? Can you tell me that this shouldn't be in every single
[6360.26s -> 6367.53s]  loadout? From my understanding, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to get them,
[6367.53s -> 6379.45s]  will be able to get them. If you know what I mean. Could you play Grotto beast on the toilet?
[6381.40s -> 6393.37s]  I think that would be very, that would be impossible. I think how about international
[6393.37s -> 6399.19s]  shipping? We, that was a question we've recently asked to the, our fulfillment people.
[6399.99s -> 6406.60s]  And I don't think it's going to be anything terrible from what we were told, but I want to
[6406.60s -> 6409.24s]  make sure you guys get the right info. And I don't, I mean, this is obviously, I'm just like,
[6409.24s -> 6411.96s]  Oh, chill stream. We were just talking. I don't want to just give you wrong info.
[6412.52s -> 6431.66s]  Can we buy boosters with channel points? No, you cannot. Doomshroom. International shipping
[6431.66s -> 6438.25s]  is always a nightmare. Yeah. And unfortunately there's not much I can really do about it. It
[6438.25s -> 6451.08s]  just kind of is what it is, but I don't think it's going to be terrible. I'll try the Doomshroom
[6451.08s -> 6463.64s]  for the different rarities. So there's, there are common cards and there are rare cards. And
[6463.64s -> 6467.58s]  then obviously there's hollow versions. I think of everything. You get a hollow in every pack.
[6468.97s -> 6477.58s]  You get a rare in every pack, but what those are, that's all kind of random. You didn't get
[6477.58s -> 6491.11s]  the grave buster. Shit. It's all right. What about anything digital? It's, it's really tricky
[6491.11s -> 6496.68s]  because I don't, I don't really know if I even have an answer to that question because we have
[6496.68s -> 6501.96s]  this plan of like, we have this limited amount of these cards and these kits. That's what we
[6501.96s -> 6509.40s]  got. And that's what we're going to do. All that stuff would have to come later, depending on
[6509.40s -> 6531.77s]  how many people care about it or buy it or, and all that stuff. Don't eat that. Are they standard
[6531.77s -> 6543.21s]  size cards? I believe they are. Believe they are. Will it be possible to collect all the cards with
[6543.21s -> 6552.46s]  it being limited to that? I don't, I don't know. I don't think so. We still were talking about like
[6552.46s -> 6558.63s]  what happens after. How do we handle something like that? Cause at the very, very end of the day,
[6558.63s -> 6565.56s]  it was sort of just a, it was sort of a project that was based around, Hey, what do you get in
[6565.56s -> 6575.50s]  this pack? Oh, whoa, cool. What did you get in yours? Kind of thing. All right. Like don't tell
[6575.50s -> 6583.64s]  anybody this because it's a secret. I thought about putting in like golden tickets and like,
[6583.64s -> 6589.78s]  there's something like, what the fuck is this? But like a hundred golden tickets in packs or
[6589.78s -> 6597.11s]  something. I'm going to lose. Okay. Hold on. I thought about like, Oh, what if like this just,
[6597.19s -> 6601.35s]  I don't know. Me giving like, like the middle finger in a Polaroid, like wrapped in a golden
[6601.35s -> 6605.75s]  foil or something in them. But I was like, Oh, we kind of, we probably can't. I got to use this
[6605.75s -> 6613.69s]  right now before I lose. Oh fuck. Hold on. I was talking. But like, I don't, I don't want to do
[6613.69s -> 6618.09s]  that. That's probably a bad idea. Reset, reset, reset, reset, reset, reset. This is, I fucked it
[6618.09s -> 6648.68s]  up. Reset. This time I'm taking this. All right. I think that's good. This sucks, but it's okay.
[6648.92s -> 6656.10s]  My child bought a pack. Yeah. I, that's, that's what I mean. I want it to be very just kind of
[6656.10s -> 6662.55s]  general audience. Like it doesn't matter. I kind of want like some little kid, Oh Grotto beast.
[6662.55s -> 6665.99s]  What's this? And they open it. It's just me with like a cigarette in my mouth, giving like two
[6665.99s -> 6678.02s]  fingers. No, that's not a good idea. That would be bad. Don't ask me why there would be a cigarette,
[6678.02s -> 6711.05s]  like a cigar or something. Cigarette comedian. Yeah. Have you thought about Kickstarter to do
[6711.05s -> 6717.46s]  anything more like this? I've thought about it, but I don't want to do it. I would rather need to
[6717.46s -> 6724.17s]  be sort of, I would rather need to answer to myself and have to answer to a bunch of people
[6724.17s -> 6731.50s]  is money I took. I don't, I'm, I don't know if I'm completely comfortable doing that. And there's
[6731.50s -> 6734.70s]  not, I don't have anything, something wrong, I don't think with something like a Kickstarter, but
[6735.66s -> 6742.10s]  just personally, I would rather be the one responsible for it because who knows, right?
[6742.18s -> 6748.58s]  And look, I am not, I'm not certain how well or how poorly this project is going to do. I don't
[6748.58s -> 6754.10s]  know. I would rather just be able to exist and be like a fun thing that people think maybe for a
[6754.10s -> 6758.18s]  little while is cool. And maybe, maybe not. Maybe if you really like it, but I would rather be
[6758.18s -> 6763.70s]  beholden to myself with that and not be like, yeah, everybody. I want to do this project called
[6763.70s -> 6771.21s]  Grotto beast. Please give me hundreds of thousands of dollars and yeah, let me, uh, cool. And then
[6771.53s -> 6778.02s]  it comes out and what if it's not, what if you don't like it? I don't ever want that to happen.
[6778.02s -> 6785.46s]  I really don't. I would rather it be something that I did than something that you had to pay for.
[6786.74s -> 6799.72s]  This guy's English is terrible. My English? What do you mean? My English? What do you mean?
[6799.72s -> 6808.52s]  My English is bad. Are you in bed? Yeah, I'm lying. I'm lying on my back right now.
[6809.72s -> 6819.70s]  I think I'm doing it. I'm going to do an explosion over here.
[6820.66s -> 6831.50s]  Pairing for it. Stop yelling at me. Stop yelling at me. Oh, he's got a huge raid coming in.
[6833.00s -> 6840.02s]  Box box. What's up? Welcome all box box viewers. Chilling out playing some plants versus zombies.
[6840.74s -> 6853.82s]  Hope you had a good stream box box. Good to see your name. Yeah. Just chilling out. No camera
[6853.82s -> 6865.91s]  or anything. Just relaxing. Oh wait. No, this is fine. I have a lot of money now. Let's get rid
[6865.91s -> 6899.67s]  of some more of these. I think I'm safe. I need to start replacing these though. That's okay.
[6899.67s -> 6908.71s]  Oh, I don't even want to deal with it. It'll probably respawn by the time I'm here, right?
[6909.27s -> 6928.84s]  Better. I didn't want to put it there. I'm annoyed by that. Okay. I think I'm in a good spot.
[6929.40s -> 6958.07s]  There we go. Good. Everything is solid. What about are you doing anything about scalpers?
[6958.71s -> 6963.34s]  So because we have a limited amount, it's not just like, oh yeah, there's going to be like
[6964.06s -> 6970.38s]  hundreds of millions of packs are being created, right? We're going to be doing a system where
[6971.34s -> 6974.22s]  I think we're going to, and I don't want to get this wrong, so it could change,
[6975.34s -> 6979.98s]  but there are things we're going to be doing to make it so whoever wants to order them can be like,
[6979.98s -> 6986.46s]  I want these and I want this many. And then when the limited run is over, that's kind of it.
[6987.18s -> 7009.05s]  That's pretty clean. Something like pre-orders. Yeah. We've talked about like stuff like pre-sales
[7009.05s -> 7015.78s]  to kind of be like, all right, who's buying this? Yeah, I'm thinking about it. It's something,
[7015.78s -> 7020.81s]  because like I said, I want to make sure that it's like a fun thing for the community to do,
[7021.37s -> 7033.03s]  because that's what it is at the end of the day. It's sort of that 10 plus years of references and
[7033.03s -> 7051.37s]  stuff. And it's kind of like Omega merch in a way. What about stuff like tournaments? I really,
[7051.37s -> 7058.36s]  I don't know. I think I really, we really kind of need to see what happens, like how people
[7059.24s -> 7064.04s]  kind of consume it and what they think about it. And I am much more concerned with people being
[7064.04s -> 7072.63s]  like, this was fun. I enjoyed this. No, that's okay. I think that kind of stuff has to happen
[7072.63s -> 7095.18s]  after, later after the fact. I really like this chill stream format. Can you please do some back
[7095.18s -> 7116.76s]  flips and jumping jacks? Oh, I'm all right. Yeah. There is a, you can follow the Grotty Beast
[7116.76s -> 7126.47s]  Twitter. You can sign up on the Grotty Beast website. What if I just do this? Okay. That
[7126.47s -> 7138.15s]  thing's insane, but I can't put anything else there, right? A lot of these. Are you ever going
[7138.15s -> 7159.82s]  to get a tattoo of your channel logo? No, I'm not. I don't have a plan to do that. I just hope
[7159.82s -> 7164.70s]  people like it. A lot of the concerns that I always have with anything, whether it's a show
[7164.70s -> 7170.94s]  or a stream or like if people genuinely think that was like, hey, or cool or fun or whatever
[7171.74s -> 7192.44s]  goes through my mind a lot. Freeze them dummy. I got, I'm going to hold on to my freezes. Oh
[7192.44s -> 7216.54s]  shit. I'm out of room. Hopefully this. Okay. Oh, that's a lot of money. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[7216.54s -> 7249.34s]  There we go. Do you have any life-size cardboard cutouts of you? I do not. Sorry to disappoint.
[7249.34s -> 7257.66s]  There was hesitation in your voice. Uh-oh. Look out. Hold on. We're going to do this.
[7263.99s -> 7280.23s]  Freeze. Oh, this is the second area done. What about the Battle Axe stream? Yeah. Battle Axe
[7280.23s -> 7286.98s]  stream has changed a few times. I made it way more elaborate and then I simplified it and then
[7286.98s -> 7321.86s]  I made it way more elaborate again. It's my own fault. Indecisive Andy. Pretty much. Oh, I missed.
[7321.86s -> 7338.98s]  Sorry. Just die. Your face is all smushed up. Just die already. Die. Die. Why is he still alive?
[7339.62s -> 7359.94s]  Fine. This is going to be huge. You have a bunch of dooms? Yeah, I'm going to use them right here.
[7359.94s -> 7389.83s]  Check this out. While you save them. That was cheese. Do you plant non aqua? Oh, okay. Right.
[7389.83s -> 7405.88s]  Oh, they introduced this stuff. I forgot about this. They need to put the lay pads down. Well,
[7405.88s -> 7422.10s]  I mean, that's incredibly important. Do utility first. Uh, the pool stages are the best. How come
[7422.10s -> 7432.06s]  you said that like this was a recent update to the game? Yeah. Oh yeah. The most recent patch.
[7433.51s -> 7445.30s]  They probably last patch and plans for zombies one was probably like 2012. What should I bring?
[7445.30s -> 7451.61s]  It's pretty standard, right? I'll just, I'm going to be greedy. Yeah, let's be wicked greedy.
[7451.61s -> 7476.81s]  The last patch of the game was the steam update. Oh, then like actually porting it to steam.
[7476.81s -> 7490.76s]  What is the oldest reference in grotto beasts? That's a good question. I wonder. I'd have to
[7490.76s -> 7507.35s]  look up. I'd have to look into it. Get armed, please. It's I'll tell you a little bit of lore,
[7507.35s -> 7514.68s]  though. There are a couple of cards that are referencing a stream that never happened.
[7516.20s -> 7525.29s]  And there's a story there. I thought, okay, so a stream was going to happen
[7525.29s -> 7530.63s]  that ended up not happening. And there are grotto beast references to this stream
[7533.19s -> 7537.86s]  and it never happened. So people are going to be like, what does this even mean?
[7539.43s -> 7548.17s]  Why is this a card? Cause I thought it was going to happen before grotto beast came out.
[7548.81s -> 7561.78s]  Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I know you can do it.
[7561.78s -> 7566.18s]  Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I don't care.
[7566.18s -> 7594.17s]  Still putting sunflowers in the back. Wait, what? Sunflowers should go back here to protect them.
[7597.32s -> 7615.51s]  Dude, don't get me started. I might do a triple column. Do not blow up from that.
[7615.51s -> 7625.66s]  I mean, I'll be pissed. Will it happen in the future? No. That's the, that's the interesting
[7625.66s -> 7645.98s]  thing. No. What stream was it? I wonder if you guys maybe we'll figure it out. I'm curious if
[7645.98s -> 7653.42s]  people know. You will know. It's referencing a couple of direct jokes from this, that stream
[7653.42s -> 7669.14s]  that was going to happen. I think they were pretty funny, but that's just me. No, it's not
[7669.14s -> 7680.33s]  the hamster stream. Well, you're talking about the hamster stream. Like that was a stream that was
[7680.33s -> 7709.59s]  going to happen. That stream was not going to happen. They haven't even come close. There we
[7709.59s -> 7746.70s]  go. Was it Mr. Green's casino? Yes. Yes, it was. I guess what I said, the stream's not happening
[7746.70s -> 7756.41s]  anymore. So why don't we just talk about it? I was going to do a stream kind of late last year
[7756.41s -> 7767.88s]  where I got in as I'm talking like Jim Carrey Grinch level prosthetics and painted myself green
[7767.88s -> 7778.87s]  and ran a casino and invited a bunch of streamers to it. Yeah, it was going to be
[7778.87s -> 7791.50s]  fucked up too. It was going to be fucking wild and there's going to be all kinds of fucked up games
[7791.50s -> 7803.75s]  like, Oh, there's blackjack. But what the hell is that over there? It was because of the gambling
[7803.75s -> 7809.99s]  ban. Um, I'd had some to do with it, but I think just logistically, it was going to be hard to do
[7809.99s -> 7813.80s]  at the end of that year. And there was a lot of other stuff that I wanted to do at the end of
[7813.80s -> 7822.38s]  the year. It had a little bit to do with it. I think, wait, this thing is actually kind of good,
[7822.38s -> 7834.46s]  isn't it? Yeah, I was going to walk around. There was going to be like four assistants behind me,
[7834.46s -> 7845.21s]  you know, doing those kinds of routines. If for some reason this ever does happen for any reason,
[7845.21s -> 7854.39s]  which I'm telling you it's not, there is some stuff that's really fun in there. I think why
[7854.39s -> 7863.99s]  won't it happen? Cause it's very expensive show. And I learned that too, through the process of
[7863.99s -> 7871.91s]  trying to figure out how to do it. That's a, that's a show that's, um, very expensive. We will pay
[7871.91s -> 7883.61s]  for it kicks. No, no, no, we're not doing kickstarters. Um, I like this thing a lot.
[7892.01s -> 7910.14s]  Yeah. Kickstart, kickstart me to open up my own casino. If you came across that on Kickstarter,
[7910.14s -> 7913.86s]  I'm pretty sure you would immediately click the X in the top right corner.
[7916.65s -> 7933.80s]  Imagine coming across that at the squash is okay. In fact, I'm going to use it probably right now.
[7933.80s -> 7956.86s]  Wow. Only 50 cents too. I think if you had the money, it would be easier. Um, sometimes it's
[7956.86s -> 7961.26s]  really not about the money, about like how logistically they even get it off the ground
[7961.26s -> 7973.08s]  in the first place. We're going to be just utilizing this. It's not about the money.
[7973.08s -> 7996.22s]  Is this game easy? I would say this game is, I don't think it's really hard. It's more just kind
[7996.22s -> 8004.26s]  of fun. It's relaxing. It gets, I think it gets really hard eventually. It's casual. It's a casual
[8004.26s -> 8023.27s]  game, but you know, we played those. Nothing wrong with that. Would it be more expensive than
[8024.23s -> 8042.90s]  Yes. At least that was the thought process. Do not come close please. No.
[8046.07s -> 8054.73s]  Ooh. Present. Mini games unlocked. Cool. Um, okay. I got to thank God for the squash.
[8061.06s -> 8066.18s]  Something else that's important too. And it's kind of a real talk stream maybe in a way too.
[8067.77s -> 8072.97s]  I also don't want, I don't know. I kind of don't want to fly too close to the sun in a way.
[8072.97s -> 8078.65s]  Okay. It's just like, Oh, look at all these things to do. Look, all these ideas,
[8078.65s -> 8085.37s]  all these things. So maybe I'll do this and maybe I'll do that. I really don't want to,
[8085.93s -> 8093.64s]  you know, what, you know, go too hard on something. Uh-oh. Oh my God. I need to do this right now.
[8096.18s -> 8098.74s]  That's okay. Oh my God. I'm not even paying any attention.
[8101.72s -> 8106.84s]  Let's real talk for a second. I'm not playing the game anymore. You can very clearly tell.
[8107.40s -> 8128.20s]  Somebody just called me Icarus. What is Icarus? You don't want to overexert yourself.
[8129.59s -> 8133.19s]  I feel like I've had so much fun and so many of these projects have been so much
[8133.19s -> 8142.02s]  just fun to work on. I guess like there's a little bit of fear that I'm, if you go too hard,
[8142.02s -> 8147.46s]  too much, I got to go bigger. I've got to go better. I've got to do more. I don't want to
[8147.46s -> 8154.34s]  fuck it up for myself in a way. I'm kind of forcing myself to do like a huge thing. It's almost,
[8155.99s -> 8171.14s]  I don't know. You just referenced Icarus? Yeah, I know. Did I? You're uneducated. I just heard,
[8171.14s -> 8181.02s]  I've heard that term before. Oh shit. I flew too close to the sun. Uh-oh. What happened?
[8182.06s -> 8193.05s]  Little bro doesn't know the myth. What? I, I feel like I've heard it on like TV before.
[8201.24s -> 8226.66s]  He can't be serious. That can be hard. He probably thought it was from kid Icarus. You know,
[8227.62s -> 8254.50s]  I was going to ask. Oh, you mean, hey, they ain't even coming close. I think to finish that thought,
[8254.50s -> 8263.19s]  one of the reasons to bring streams like this back. So I don't do that. I don't kind of just
[8263.19s -> 8276.30s]  fly into outer space. I think streams like this bringing these back are kind of grounding for me
[8276.30s -> 8292.44s]  in a way that makes sense. It wants us to lower our expectations. If that's how you see it, then
[8292.60s -> 8314.04s]  that's probably what I mean. One winged Andy. Ladies and gentlemen, the play through has just
[8314.04s -> 8354.50s]  begun. This is my favorite plant in the game. It's so expensive. I like the double flower too.
[8354.50s -> 8364.02s]  Oh, the shop. That's right. There is the shop. Can I do it from the main menu? Wait a minute.
[8364.02s -> 8392.49s]  Is there, how do I get there? I haven't unlocked it. That laugh. I don't need this anymore. I'm
[8392.49s -> 8427.14s]  going to use this. Go wait. No, I need this. Oh, after beating three, four, you've set it for
[8427.14s -> 8454.89s]  Pikmin four. Nobody tell them. Do you guys remember the Pikmin streams for the Wii? I, I got so
[8454.89s -> 8462.17s]  irrationally angry at that game. I don't even know why it's, it's just kind of, I mean, it's not,
[8462.17s -> 8470.12s]  that's not a relaxing game. You're against the clock. I complained about the Wiimote and this
[8470.12s -> 8478.17s]  is not an exaggeration. Probably, probably 30 times over the course of what? Two, five to six
[8478.17s -> 8482.86s]  hour streams. If you break it down, it's like, I complained about the Wiimote once every probably
[8482.86s -> 8491.96s]  12 minutes. And we're not talking about very, no, the Wiimote stinks. No, it was like, like,
[8491.96s -> 8498.89s]  fuck this whole system. Like I hated it for a while. Right? Like I was embarrassingly angry
[8498.89s -> 8525.61s]  at that game. Come on. No, what did I do that for? It's all right. It shoots in three lanes.
[8525.61s -> 8538.33s]  I fucked up. Good thing I have the crutch. I wanted to cover the whole pool, but I forgot
[8538.33s -> 8551.02s]  what I was doing. There's a 32 minute video called Wiimote woes. Yeah, I'm sure there is.
[8557.99s -> 8563.05s]  Look at that. Look at that coverage now. You'd be probably asking,
[8563.85s -> 8568.06s]  what about this spot, man? This guy who cares being doing shit.
[8568.06s -> 8626.14s]  And he said, bro, what? I'm fine. This is, I'm, I'm, I'm teching right now. Don't you understand?
[8626.14s -> 8706.22s]  I'm teching. What you got? See ya. I'm teching. It's getting overwhelmed there.
[8706.94s -> 8719.77s]  My teching is almost done. What does teching mean? It means when you play an RTS, right?
[8719.77s -> 8724.25s]  And you don't do anything but build all like the upgraded buildings and just hope that nobody
[8724.25s -> 8753.35s]  comes and attacks you in the first like 30 minutes of the game. Plans for zombies. You
[8753.35s -> 8758.95s]  don't have to tech. Yeah, but I want to look and now the huge wave is going to come and I've got a
[8758.95s -> 8789.03s]  lot of stuff doubling up here too. All right. I think I'm good. A lot of coverage. Nice. Yeah,
[8789.03s -> 8799.45s]  we're good. Look at that. How can you put a three shot in the top lane? Um, yeah, I messed that one
[8801.38s -> 8812.62s]  up. That's on me. You're nothing without your bombs. That's good. I like that.
[8814.26s -> 8819.75s]  Quarantine that pulls a zombie underwater. Nice. What flavor deodorant do you wear?
[8819.75s -> 8829.90s]  Deodorants don't have a flavor. They have a smell. Hey dude, what flavor deodorant do you have on?
[8829.90s -> 8848.50s]  Oh, it's a green apple. Um, I, I'll be honest. I don't really have a preference. It's just whatever
[8848.50s -> 8855.16s]  is whatever the first thing that I see that smells remotely. Okay. In like a drug store
[8855.16s -> 8862.34s]  or something. Is there, okay, that's what I'm going to do. I really don't like the
[8862.34s -> 8875.34s]  deodorants that have that heavy, heavy smell. No, it's not for me. All right. I gotta be careful.
[8875.34s -> 8883.27s]  I don't do too much like, you know, tech. This is a lot of utility and not a whole lot of damage.
[8883.27s -> 8888.28s]  It's all right. I'll just tech. I'll be fine. I'm just going to, yeah, I'll be fine.
[8888.28s -> 8913.78s]  Let me do a regular though. There we go. No, don't you hate when that happens. It's okay.
[8913.78s -> 8944.47s]  I don't like the start, but it's okay. Why are you throwing? I haven't wig up. Look at all,
[8944.47s -> 8983.53s]  we got plenty of time. I'm the no rush. Oh my goodness. Thank God. Hey, we need to do that.
[8983.53s -> 8986.41s]  This is not throwing. When somebody jumps in the water, they're going to get pulled down.
[8986.41s -> 9017.29s]  Need to get something out there. Your Elden ring streams were more children. I, uh,
[9018.95s -> 9028.78s]  I disagree. I don't think that's accurate. I almost like bit my camera during those streams.
[9028.78s -> 9061.03s]  I, I think you're, I think you're wrong on that one. Start. Oh, you tech. Look at that placement
[9061.03s -> 9077.54s]  too. Oh, you just, you dream of placement like that. All right. See, this is why I did this.
[9078.18s -> 9098.92s]  I need, I want one here and one here and then I'll stop with the triples. My favorite item.
[9098.92s -> 9116.06s]  Of course I'm going to use it. Would you say that you're the Jim Carrey of streaming? No,
[9116.06s -> 9125.85s]  I think comparing yourselves to other comparing yourself to other people is always a kind of a
[9125.85s -> 9134.07s]  recipe for kind of disaster in my mind. I'm just trying to be, I'm just trying to be this dude here.
[9134.87s -> 9154.78s]  You know what? Okay. Let's go even more. I'm like, how do you even make that comparison? No,
[9154.78s -> 9168.82s]  I wouldn't. Would you say that you're the German nine eight five Twitch? Yeah, I'm not. Yeah. I
[9168.82s -> 9187.58s]  mean, that's close. I think maybe this is godly placement by the way. What do you think you're
[9187.58s -> 9199.05s]  doing? Oh, it's okay. I'm neglecting the top and bottom row, but it's all right. I didn't miss
[9199.05s -> 9238.07s]  money. They're impossible. These things are useful. I'm all right. I need to slow down with these
[9238.07s -> 9247.13s]  things. You missed money. Oh shit. All right. I got like, I got like five grand down here.
[9247.85s -> 9293.22s]  Pretty good. Taking a lot of hits. Got one more big wave. You know what? Let's see. Let's just
[9293.22s -> 9337.22s]  triple up on it. Let's go. Just like swallowed that word. Replace the P shooter. No, nothing's
[9337.22s -> 9367.37s]  getting for this. Are you kidding me? Good carry bomb. After this, I'm going to take a quick break
[9367.93s -> 9382.41s]  here. Otto, he wants to go outside. You can now visit the shop. Cool. My car keys.
[9385.05s -> 9393.18s]  Ooh, 20,000. Um, all right. Let me look at this first. All right. We're just going to,
[9393.18s -> 9396.54s]  I'll take a quick break. I'll be right back. I'm just going to let Otto out. Let me get some more
[9396.54s -> 10004.54s]  tea. I'll be right back. Let's keep this music. It's fine. He's just been talking. He's just going
[10004.54s -> 10029.82s]  like, stop this mad man. He's just been talking to you. Cancel Dave. What the fuck? All right.
[10029.82s -> 10048.26s]  Let's keep going. Dude, your channel is going to get banned. Okay. So I have 600 bucks. I get the
[10048.82s -> 10064.82s]  rake. Oh, this is a consumable. I don't think I want this. Ooh. Yep. I'm saving up for that.
[10064.82s -> 10069.72s]  First thing I want to get the pool cleaner. Yeah. The pool cleaner is important. This is
[10069.72s -> 10087.26s]  the most important thing. Yeah. I'm not, I don't want to defend your shins a little. Oh,
[10089.00s -> 10097.75s]  very pixelated. Double sunflower is mid. What? That's not twice the sun.
[10098.23s -> 10114.84s]  I fucked it up. It's all right. Is Dave a mog like, no, I wouldn't say so.
[10140.02s -> 10153.86s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I have to.
[10153.86s -> 10184.65s]  It's 1153 where I'm from. Did I drink a coffee? 1153 PM? Or is that AM? AM or PM? PM? I'm not
[10184.65s -> 10190.09s]  going to tell you what you should and shouldn't do with your life, but I feel like that's a very
[10190.09s -> 10206.02s]  late. Well, when did you get up? That's another question. Did you wake up at 1030 PM? That's a
[10206.02s -> 10213.22s]  question. Are you on like a reverse schedule right now? These are all important questions,
[10213.22s -> 10236.07s]  Dave. No coffee past three. I would tell you that, but that's a lie. There's tons of times
[10236.07s -> 10240.95s]  you've seen me stream past five, six, seven o'clock where I've had coffee or something.
[10247.08s -> 10253.54s]  These bomb placements, they're just so good. Yeah. Also, what's your relationship with caffeine
[10253.54s -> 10270.94s]  too? That's important. Crying with laughter. Wasn't it good though? Wasn't it funny? Wasn't
[10270.94s -> 10294.07s]  it funny? That's going to die, right? Yeah. A nice like, a nice cappuccino is nice though.
[10294.07s -> 10301.27s]  Cappuccino is a nice kind of night coffee, afternoon coffee, I think.
[10307.32s -> 10323.08s]  Espresso and shit. Cappuccinos are fine. I'll order a cappuccino at a restaurant just to kind
[10323.08s -> 10328.52s]  of make people think like, oh yeah, of course. Any desserts or coffee or anything? Of course.
[10329.00s -> 10340.95s]  I'll take a cappuccino. Oh, okay. That's what you're ordering. Yeah. And then when I get it,
[10340.95s -> 10350.52s]  I hold it up and I take a little sip and I go, perfect. I don't, I don't actually do that.
[10350.52s -> 10366.86s]  You psycho. I don't, I'm kidding. I don't do that. I actually really liked this one. All right. We're
[10366.86s -> 10376.70s]  back to, wait, wait, wait. This thing runs over plants, right? Is it two hands or one on the
[10376.70s -> 10384.02s]  coffee? I'm imagining both hands holding it from the bottom and slowly dipping it up and
[10385.38s -> 10389.78s]  it might like blink, blink, blink, blink. Eyes going up, blink, blink, blink. Oh, it's so good.
[10389.78s -> 10407.78s]  You're going to spill it, dude. Yeah. All right. What do I want to do? What the fuck are you
[10407.78s -> 10416.38s]  talking about? We're talking about drinking cappuccino. Guys, the last time I drank cappuccino,
[10416.38s -> 10423.61s]  I don't even, there's no memory. I know I've done it like three times. This needs to go here.
[10431.00s -> 10442.54s]  Oh no, no, no, no. All right. I'm doing a new crutch. It's the jalapeno. I think that's a new
[10442.54s -> 10488.17s]  crutch. Why are you drinking coffee? Looney Tunes style. That's a great comment. Someone said,
[10488.17s -> 10494.60s]  don't use lilies at the beginning. You're ruining your economy. I think you're actually right,
[10494.60s -> 10508.28s]  but it's in my brain. It's kind of wired there. I got a plan. Don't worry.
[10516.62s -> 10529.93s]  Look, my economy is doing fine. I almost did it. See, I thought about what that
[10529.93s -> 10569.21s]  person in chat said. I didn't do it. I thought about it. I need some big ones. All right. I need
[10569.21s -> 10579.22s]  some triples. Was it waste? Maybe for you. It was. It wasn't for me. This is going to die, right?
[10579.30s -> 10586.81s]  This is going to die, right? All right. This is where it begins. We did our teching in the
[10586.81s -> 10629.78s]  beginning. Now it's time to really, really let it all lose here. Come on. Now I'm going to put one
[10629.78s -> 10668.82s]  right here. And we just steam roll. Everything's fine. Did you just make the whole area sunflowers?
[10673.29s -> 10694.26s]  I mean, I was loose. Maybe you'd think it was funny for a minute. Can that hit more than one
[10694.26s -> 10730.55s]  person? It can. Holy shit. I didn't know that. Going down the middle again. Come on. Be enough.
[10730.55s -> 10758.62s]  I missed a gold coin. Oh, fuck. It was a big one. Pick up the coins. I was picking up the
[10758.62s -> 10775.24s]  fucking sun. 1 a.m. plans for zombies goes pretty hard. All right. This is it. I think I'm good.
[10775.24s -> 10790.44s]  I got everything I need. Let's preemptively. All right. I'm preparing. And I think I'm all right.
[10791.08s -> 10813.88s]  I'm going to drop this right here. Ready? There we go. You lost the symmetry. We don't need
[10813.88s -> 10829.40s]  symmetry. So is this like damage over time? I think somebody's asked me about my viewer
[10829.40s -> 10836.86s]  count or something. I try not to pay attention to it because view count is one of those things that
[10838.20s -> 10846.97s]  you really kind of get in your head. I really don't want it to. We make jokes a lot of time
[10846.97s -> 10851.83s]  of like, oh, my God, a bunch of people left. But, you know, I mean, I'm just I don't really
[10851.83s -> 10859.13s]  I don't want to pay that much attention to it alone. Every single zombie is my enemy.
[10859.69s -> 10868.57s]  No, this thing's probably bad here. It's a lot of water, right? How much is it right in the middle?
[10868.57s -> 10883.61s]  Is that worth taking? I'll try it. Why not? How could I forget my favorite? Does anybody else
[10883.61s -> 10900.82s]  have to line them up correctly? In my brain, this is the correct order. All right, let's try it.
[10900.82s -> 10905.30s]  I'm not going to do it this time. I'm going to skip this. I'm not going to put two of these
[10905.30s -> 10914.44s]  lily pads down. I almost did it while I was talking about it. You can't play plants versus
[10914.44s -> 10945.06s]  zombie without beatboxing once. Dude, come on. Why is that accurate, though? It's funny. Remember,
[10945.06s -> 10953.50s]  what's a nutmeg? I have no idea. I just know you grind it against like a shaver thing and
[10953.50s -> 10973.96s]  you put it on stuff as a nut of some kind. I don't have any idea what it is. Spice? I mean,
[10973.96s -> 10981.35s]  what the hell even is it? It's a nut. Yeah, that's what I said. I said, I don't know like what
[10981.35s -> 10984.79s]  deal is. I just know it's a nut and you shave it on to make like things tasty.
[10985.59s -> 10993.11s]  Yeah, speaking of that, you guys ever seen how weird chocolate is?
[10994.87s -> 11000.39s]  I'm convinced that aliens fucking put chocolate on this planet. It's literally like alien eggs.
[11000.39s -> 11006.31s]  Have you ever seen what it looks like? I got like a cocoa pod. It's fucking insane looking.
[11007.88s -> 11020.50s]  Here we go. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yeah, hold on. Hold on. Hold on a second.
[11021.22s -> 11030.36s]  Now that's right. We're gonna relax. There's no reason to talk about aliens. And if they may or
[11030.36s -> 11061.85s]  may not have landed here and drop cocoa pods with like alien fucking fluid in them. You know what?
[11061.85s -> 11070.57s]  Let's try this. I'm just curious. How does this work? I got some more tea, by the way. Anybody
[11070.57s -> 11091.99s]  else get any? Autumn row? Yeah. Good. I'm gonna put a triple here. Is it chamomile? It's orange
[11091.99s -> 11096.98s]  spice. I don't know exactly what it is. That's probably nutmeg or something fucking weird.
[11099.08s -> 11141.61s]  Shave the nutmeg in it myself. I need a triple here. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't get this, but I might
[11141.61s -> 11149.69s]  not. And it's making me very concerned. Yep. I'm just gonna go for it. It's all about the tech.
[11150.65s -> 11165.72s]  I kind of like these. They stick around forever. Can anything break those?
[11166.36s -> 11186.04s]  It's just a nice little bit of damage before they get over here. Uh, there's gonna be only
[11186.04s -> 11203.13s]  breaking. Too much nutmeg can actually poison you. Really? That's terrifying. I feel like a lot of
[11203.13s -> 11221.24s]  things are like that though. Too much of anything will kill you. Yeah. That's why you just gotta
[11221.24s -> 11227.72s]  follow that philosophy. Too much of anything is gonna, is gonna kill you. Just do everything
[11228.36s -> 11234.42s]  in moderation. Put a little bit of nutmeg on it. Not the whole bottle, but I don't know what
[11234.42s -> 11247.86s]  this conversation is. If I'm honest with you. Uh, I want one here. Symmetry is broken here,
[11247.86s -> 11285.05s]  but whatever. What about too much germa? Yeah. I would say that too. Die. Come on. Come on.
[11287.53s -> 11302.95s]  I've been holding this tea in my hand and I haven't taken one sip in my, I was like,
[11302.95s -> 11317.90s]  why does my arm hurt? It's because I've just been holding it up in my hand. Pretty clean.
[11318.54s -> 11325.51s]  One more wave. I gotta defend the top and bottom rows here.
[11326.31s -> 11344.52s]  I kind of feel like that you kind of want to play this game from 15 feet away. I feel like
[11344.52s -> 11349.35s]  that would be easier. I feel like I could see more if I would just sat like 20 feet away.
[11356.10s -> 11390.90s]  Just old? Yeah, that's true. Penses. Guys. No, the symmetry! No!
[11395.29s -> 11403.82s]  Feels like watching a VOD from years ago in real time. Glad you're bringing these back.
[11403.82s -> 11411.80s]  Now I'm glad to hear that. I hope that's um, I hope it's been like a chill time.
[11411.96s -> 11426.23s]  So many games to play. Just hang out and do this. Expect way more of these. These streams are wicked
[11426.23s -> 11437.78s]  chill, man. Check the shop. Ooh, good idea. Are these actually worth it? An extra line of this.
[11437.78s -> 11455.10s]  Should I buy it? I want to save up my favorite thing. Would you play old school RuneScape?
[11455.10s -> 11469.00s]  I'm going to save. Oh, these things are awesome. I'm going to be, if I take this, I'm going to be
[11469.00s -> 11478.36s]  such a tech idiot. I'm going to spend the entire first three waves just building out this tech.
[11478.60s -> 11492.55s]  I don't care. Should I even? No, I need. I think this is good. I got a lot of things I can do.
[11492.55s -> 11512.95s]  I'll try it. Okay. Let's tech. Play OSRS. You have no cheap attackers. Sorry. I got this. I got this.
[11512.95s -> 11518.20s]  I just need to get to a point where I can do one of these downs. Like Garden Warfare. I'm up for
[11518.20s -> 11557.56s]  anything. I really am. See? Check this out. We good? He's not even close. That's actually a pretty
[11557.56s -> 11572.60s]  good idea. Just playing something like a Garden Warfare. Like, who cares? All right. I'm sure a
[11572.60s -> 11578.90s]  lot of you guys probably join in the games and stuff and whatever. It'd be fun. Oh, I actually
[11578.90s -> 11591.72s]  blew it. I blew it. Maybe not. I blew it. I blew it. I blew it. I got to restart. That was my own
[11591.72s -> 11618.98s]  fault. No, I blew it. I shouldn't have put the lily pads down. Let's try that. I won't fuck it
[11618.98s -> 11626.14s]  up this time. This is a hard game to take a sip of a drink, by the way. Like, my finger has to
[11626.14s -> 11637.94s]  constantly be on the mouse. Because if I miss clicking one of these, people are going to
[11637.94s -> 11651.66s]  omega-lul. I'm going to be incredibly embarrassed. No more. Just wait. Put one of these down here.
[11654.44s -> 11675.99s]  There. I think the crisis has been averted. I'm getting so greedy. I had to. Oh, wait. I don't
[11675.99s -> 11698.18s]  have my smasher. I'm nothing without the smasher. I have to stop doing this. I'm just obsessed with
[11698.18s -> 11725.99s]  it. I'm obsessed with sunflower money. You're so tan today. Thanks. I'm getting some sun.
[11733.54s -> 11748.95s]  All right. I've got to focus on this. Fire goes here. Please kill that.
[11750.79s -> 11793.11s]  You should play Viva Pinata again. I've actually thought about playing something like that again.
[11793.11s -> 11795.99s]  All right. Hold on. This is important. This is super important.
[11796.87s -> 11806.14s]  Oh, important. Important. Okay. This is my opportunity here.
[11807.34s -> 11822.58s]  There it is. All right. I've got to get two triples down here. What the hell was that?
[11823.14s -> 11861.88s]  I thought that was a monkey. Oh, okay. Hold on. Oh, shit. I need my smasher. I'm nothing without
[11861.88s -> 11870.34s]  the smasher. I really am. I'm in trouble here. I have to do this. Here we go.
[11887.34s -> 11912.23s]  Kids are losing at a kid's game. We're good. Where are you going? Where? Right there. Got it.
[11912.23s -> 11944.63s]  Okay. Got it. All right. This is a big deal. Use the spikeweed before the walnut.
[11946.14s -> 11954.41s]  Shit. You're right. Hold on. All right. That should be that. That should take care of the middle.
[11960.55s -> 11997.27s]  You jumped over it. You piece of crap. We're good. Cool. Watch your language.
[11998.23s -> 12008.70s]  I have a big one. Yeah. Plans for zombies. When was the last thing they released?
[12011.83s -> 12020.58s]  Is Garden Warfare 2 the last thing they made? We've got these dolphin assholes.
[12028.30s -> 12038.25s]  So I need to hold these for when they show up. They're making three, but it looks soulless.
[12038.25s -> 12053.19s]  Oh, that's unfortunate. If I remember, you don't take both. You take one or the other.
[12053.19s -> 12065.08s]  I'm going to take this one. I need this though. You saw how bad that was. Play something in the
[12065.08s -> 12078.30s]  first lane so the water ones jump right over it. Good idea. I'll try this. I'm okay with
[12078.30s -> 12098.39s]  this for now. Dolphin can't jump over the tall nut. Ate out the dolphin with a lily. That's true,
[12098.39s -> 12110.78s]  but they're the same price. I guess this is on cooldown. Okay. This is a big one. Save money.
[12110.78s -> 12135.32s]  Squash is my favorite. Yeah, I think it is. Very useful. Let's get one in there.
[12136.89s -> 12154.07s]  Probably shouldn't have done this yet, but it's all right. Stare? Fuck you.
[12154.71s -> 12184.66s]  I just said fuck you. What is stare? What is that? Is it an emote? I can't see for some reason.
[12188.04s -> 12215.19s]  I don't know what to do. Wait, I have an idea. No, I have to do this. Oh shit. I was paying. I
[12219.48s -> 12227.26s]  just restart. I'm so mad. I was looking over at chat and somebody said fuck you and it made me
[12227.26s -> 12237.34s]  laugh. So I forgot what I was doing. Let's try that again. This is too expensive for now. It really
[12237.34s -> 12272.92s]  is. They're going to stop using it. Skill issue. Yeah, it usually is. Is it a tech issue? No,
[12272.92s -> 12291.53s]  I think it's pretty good. Got to use these quick because then it'll go and recharge immediately.
[12291.53s -> 12335.64s]  This will be charged by the time it gets down here. Here we go. All right. This is much better.
[12335.64s -> 12375.98s]  I got way more money coming in. Good. Done. Okay. We're going. We're on it now. Again that. I'm
[12375.98s -> 12389.34s]  going to put one of these in every single lane. Just you watch. His brain is fried. I'm fine.
[12390.14s -> 12400.30s]  His brain. I'm just chilling, man. Don't jump over that. Jump on his head. Yeah, two of us can do
[12400.30s -> 12438.42s]  that. Can't jump over that. All right. This is so much better. Now we load these all up.
[12439.22s -> 12471.80s]  I'm going to be sick. Big wave. Oh shit. Come on. I'm not ready. I have the cherry bombs. All right.
[12473.54s -> 12506.68s]  Okay. I'm strong. Go. All right. We're good. I'm going to put one of these here
[12507.32s -> 12536.70s]  and then I want to put a big nut over there. That we go. I think this is a win. Yeah,
[12536.70s -> 12547.64s]  this is much cleaner. Nobody's getting by this shit. Look at that. Look at that unbelievable wall
[12547.64s -> 12564.58s]  of defense. You'd be full of shit if you think you get over that. Two more big waves though.
[12565.54s -> 12579.77s]  Not that I'm concerned, but it would get ugly. How are you still here? Really? No, don't do that.
[12580.65s -> 12609.54s]  Kidding me. Why does he make it that far? I know that's stupid, but you know, whatever,
[12610.18s -> 12614.10s]  I don't have very much options right now. I should have put these closer forward, but it's all right.
[12619.27s -> 12624.65s]  It's all right. It's going to be fine. I understand that I screwed up, but it's okay.
[12625.85s -> 12668.28s]  I have bomb here. Get that shit out of here. Get that shit out of here. Okay. I don't know
[12668.28s -> 12696.26s]  what that was, but I'm glad I had this smusher. What? Oh my goodness. That was a whole bobsled
[12696.26s -> 12706.26s]  team. All right. I need to, where do I put this last nut down here? Probably. Yeah. Like right here.
[12707.66s -> 12724.39s]  Excuse me. Why can I? All right. Come on. Pray. Okay. Come on. I think I'm all right.
[12725.11s -> 12752.55s]  Smush. Best thing in the whole game. Without a doubt. Praying. Do you feel it? I kind of did.
[12752.55s -> 12762.44s]  I heard you were having a pool party. We think that is fun. We'll be right over. I'm probably
[12762.44s -> 12779.91s]  going to screw this one up a few times. We'll see. Is that enough room you think? Oh, give me
[12779.91s -> 12790.57s]  something to work with. What is this? Give me something to work with. Give me something to work
[12790.57s -> 12809.90s]  with. Give me some, give me something to work with. You gotta give me something to work with.
[12821.19s -> 12918.26s]  See? Look, it's random. It was a terrible RNG. Give me something to work with. I think I'm okay.
[12918.26s -> 12978.65s]  I see the vision. Yeah. Coming together. Give me something to work with. Fuck out of here with
[12978.65s -> 13017.16s]  this shit. Okay. I get squashed. I can't even get close. It's worked out. I need another
[13017.16s -> 13040.28s]  pulley pad here. We are doing this down here. Sorry. All right. This is working out. I need
[13040.28s -> 13064.39s]  some more lilies. I need three lilies right here. A lot of the top and bottom. Yeah. Not until I get
[13064.39s -> 13092.34s]  everything squared away here. I can't even see where the mouse is. These run over the, wait,
[13092.34s -> 13126.06s]  they can run. They run the nuts over. I didn't know that. Give me another lily pad. What? Because
[13126.06s -> 13134.14s]  I said I'm going to run my nuts over. All right. Here comes the big wave. I need to just, all right.
[13134.14s -> 13161.06s]  I gotta place them. I have to, I have to put these down. Finally, bro. What? I'm doing fine.
[13169.00s -> 13194.07s]  Look at that. We're good. Aquatic plant that shoots short ranged spores. Cool. You know,
[13194.07s -> 13199.56s]  they used to call me fog man because I would hang out in the fog and jump out at people.
[13200.90s -> 13219.46s]  Those are the days. Get out of my face. Okay. This is nighttime. What is this? It's been 10 years.
[13223.88s -> 13239.45s]  Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wait, is it, we still, is there a pool still? Is there still a pool?
[13239.45s -> 13254.02s]  No, we're not in a pool. Is there still a pool? There is. They have to be in the correct order.
[13254.02s -> 13310.26s]  I'm sorry. They just have to be. Let's try it. I just put a lily pad down here. Wait, wait,
[13310.26s -> 13334.66s]  I'll try it still. I don't need lily pads. Not necessarily. Oh, the sun shrooms. That's right.
[13334.66s -> 13358.14s]  Come on, hurry up. Okay. I know I can't really see, but this should be all right.
[13358.14s -> 13387.67s]  I got to move stuff up even though I can't see. What's with all this? What do you do?
[13387.67s -> 13396.63s]  I forget. What the hell does this thing do? What does it do? I don't even know what it does.
[13408.47s -> 13425.72s]  You'll see. You'll see with like a little like hee-hee-hee face. I didn't even use any of these.
[13427.69s -> 13444.52s]  I don't even have enough time to, on these early levels, probably shouldn't even do a second row.
[13445.08s -> 13479.90s]  Kind of unnecessary. I think I'm good. I don't like the fog though. It's annoying.
[13482.84s -> 13503.99s]  Assuming that's to get rid of it. That was too close. That was not close. Hmm. Okay. Explosive
[13503.99s -> 13514.49s]  surprise. So I'm assuming if he plays the whole song, then it'll blow up. You'll see.
[13515.77s -> 13522.70s]  All right. So what did I do wrong there? What can I improve on? Tell me. What can I improve on?
[13522.70s -> 13533.67s]  I think I'm doing one column of that. These things are just too important.
[13533.67s -> 13554.44s]  Anyway, I need the lily pads. I like these. Don't take the water shroom. Squash is important. I
[13554.44s -> 13562.02s]  need to take the lantern, right? I don't want to just have no damage though. I feel like this is
[13562.02s -> 13570.82s]  not enough. Is that not enough? Maybe just a regular peace shooter? Don't take any lily pads.
[13570.82s -> 13595.43s]  I'll try no lily pads. Just utilize this stuff. This is... I'll try it. I'll try it.
[13595.43s -> 13601.32s]  You're getting less sunlight. You should do the walnut. That's a good point, but let's try it.
[13608.02s -> 13640.04s]  Bold move. Yeah. I need that lantern. Okay. So it's only an area. Still helpful though.
[13640.04s -> 13677.50s]  How are you going to attack the middle with my aquatic sea shrooms? Something in the water?
[13677.50s -> 13705.51s]  Don't eat that. You piece of shit. Stop eating that. Yeah. I should have listened to that shatter.
[13706.23s -> 13727.67s]  That was the right call. I fucked it up. No, I fucked it up. I'm just going to reset. I played
[13727.67s -> 13736.52s]  it before, but not really to this extent. I played the second one on iPad and horrible experience.
[13737.32s -> 13764.30s]  Was the second one too hard? The second one just... It was just kind of annoying. It really,
[13764.30s -> 13770.10s]  really kind of encouraged me spending a ton of money on it. Some of the levels were so,
[13770.10s -> 13776.25s]  so hard that it had these pay mechanics where you could use these certain currency and buy
[13776.25s -> 13780.97s]  like a lightning move. It just wiped out the whole screen. And I'm talking like wiped out
[13780.97s -> 13833.94s]  the entire screen. You get the fuck out of here. I just got like so pissed. I think I'll do it,
[13833.94s -> 13853.62s]  but it's going to be ugly. It's going to be very ugly. I might lose the metal. Have I played
[13853.62s -> 13859.64s]  balloons? It was that time years ago when we did a community balloons, but you guys picked every
[13859.64s -> 13890.31s]  single spot because I was too dumb to do it. Where are you? Just die. I think we're okay.
[13890.95s -> 13924.57s]  I don't think we're going to lose. We might though. Play Temple Run. Is it fun? No. I'm seeing a lot
[13924.57s -> 13955.90s]  of nos. I think we're good. Yeah, we're good. What about subway surfers? I feel like I would
[13955.90s -> 13973.93s]  get bored of those games pretty easily. Would you stream balloons? What did you say? Would
[13973.93s -> 13980.06s]  you stream balloons TD six for a year straight? I don't think I'd want to ever do anything for
[13980.06s -> 14008.22s]  a year straight. Ooh, do balloons with click maps again. That was really fun. Yeah. The click map
[14008.22s -> 14018.42s]  streams were, they were up there. Do you guys remember that was such new, cool shit on Twitch
[14018.42s -> 14029.06s]  back like five years ago? I used, I overused the hell out of that. Like maps were just such
[14029.06s -> 14036.06s]  a wild concept. I used them almost, I think I want to say once a week at one point.
[14037.77s -> 14053.85s]  Um, not quite there. Okay. Act this. Why is that up there? Look at this. I really like the fumes room.
[14053.85s -> 14075.05s]  It's pretty cool. Are these, is this a sunlight plant? Can I use this here? You need the cactus.
[14075.05s -> 14085.32s]  You don't need sunlight. Okay. What about Peggle? I wanted to play Pegglin,
[14085.32s -> 14093.29s]  that like Peggle kind of game, right? That looks fun. Peggle is, yeah. I've never,
[14093.29s -> 14102.38s]  did I play Peggle 2 on stream? I don't think so. Uh, this is, I'll take the small one.
[14102.38s -> 14112.06s]  I feel like this is, I need the lily pad. I do. All right, let's go. Pegglin's a lot of fun.
[14112.06s -> 14139.02s]  I played the original Peggle. It's kind of sus. You didn't take squash. Oh, you're right. I didn't.
[14139.02s -> 14155.34s]  This could be a problem. You're right. Let's see what the hell's going on here.
[14155.42s -> 14175.03s]  Nobody down here, I guarantee it. What about Deep Rock Galactic? I'm down to play pretty much
[14175.03s -> 14208.73s]  anything. True, that's okay. It's pissing me off, but it's okay. I don't want to do this,
[14208.73s -> 14221.64s]  but I might have to. Oh, I have to, whatever. It's a terrible place for that. Oh shit,
[14221.64s -> 14239.77s]  I gotta pop that. Uh oh. Uh oh. Oh no. Well, that doesn't help. I'm not restarting yet. I
[14239.77s -> 14252.30s]  was about to, but I'm not gonna. I didn't know what this thing did. I want to restart so bad.
[14252.30s -> 14263.62s]  Yeah, I'm doing it. No, I'm so. Pull the bandaid off. Let's go. Okay, I need to get the lantern.
[14263.62s -> 14276.62s]  I gotta get this thing down first, because that thing flies across the whole lane. Nothing can
[14276.62s -> 14296.98s]  shoot it. Embarrassing. Now, frankly, that was embarrassing. Could you please abruptly end the
[14296.98s -> 14309.88s]  stream? I'm kind of tired. You should go to bed. You don't gotta stay up. That's the problem.
[14309.88s -> 14345.14s]  Squash wasn't there. All right, this is a terrible team, but I don't care. No, it's fine. There you
[14345.14s -> 14387.14s]  are. Shit. All right, not bad. It could have been worse. Why did you move from Boston? Um,
[14387.14s -> 14396.30s]  I kind of wanted to change. I'd been in, you know, New England almost my entire life. So,
[14397.02s -> 14404.68s]  like, at that point, it was a lot of, I want to do projects and this big stuff that I want to try
[14404.68s -> 14413.14s]  to do. And it just felt like being on the west coast was easier just because, wait, LA is right
[14413.14s -> 14417.70s]  there. Vegas has a lot of cool stuff. There's a lot of resources and opportunity and stuff out here
[14418.78s -> 14423.42s]  for like the entertainment industry. Like, you know what? Why not? But I didn't really want to
[14423.42s -> 14431.40s]  live in LA. I didn't want to be like in California, really. No, let's just put this down now. Oh,
[14431.40s -> 14440.31s]  I need one of those poppers. I need a pop. I need you to get popped. Come on. It's so close.
[14442.07s -> 14462.95s]  You fucking asshole. All right, pop. Does this still shoot? Thank God. I didn't do that bad
[14462.95s -> 14497.82s]  damage either. They didn't get through, right? Where do you shoot it? Hope nothing comes down
[14497.82s -> 14522.14s]  this way. All right, this is it. Where is the pop person going? That's not cool. Oh, that's not
[14522.14s -> 14547.40s]  cool. Wait a minute. Come on, squash. You can do it. It's all eyes on you. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Hold on.
[14547.40s -> 14559.08s]  I have an idea. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Squash is almost ready. I need some fucking damage right
[14559.08s -> 14570.98s]  now. All right. All right. Hold on. Okay. Oops. Please heal that. Thank God. All right. We're good.
[14570.98s -> 14595.03s]  You really should play Sly Cooper. I think I would like it. Nice. I'm eating my greens.
[14595.03s -> 14608.07s]  What do you got? Kale? Spinach? Lettuce? What do you got? You said wasn't I going to go soon?
[14609.03s -> 14615.75s]  I think I missed that. That was a really stressful Saturday night.
[14619.98s -> 14637.78s]  Blows away all. Oh, that's cheaper. And fog. That's pretty good. It's only temporary.
[14637.78s -> 14651.96s]  It's only one time. Lower is actually better than the cactus. You got to try each one at
[14651.96s -> 14661.51s]  least one time, right? All right. I'm seeing dolphins and I'm seeing balloons. So definitely
[14661.51s -> 14693.02s]  need to do this. I think I'm okay with that, but we'll see. If you got invited to something
[14693.02s -> 14705.80s]  like Comic-Con as a guest, would you go? Um, I don't know. Maybe, but if I'm really,
[14705.80s -> 14726.81s]  really completely upfront with everybody here, probably not. Why not? Uh, I don't know.
[14729.54s -> 14736.97s]  I don't really have a great answer. I think I went to a lot of conventions pretty early on
[14736.97s -> 14745.08s]  in the YouTube arc, if you want to call it that. I went to PAX East, PAX Prime, E3. I went to all
[14745.08s -> 14757.38s]  of them every single year. And I think I've, as I got a little bit older and as I kind of went to
[14757.38s -> 14764.14s]  a lot of them, it just started to become something that I didn't, because what used to happen was,
[14764.86s -> 14773.18s]  and obviously that this is not like this anymore, but it would be kind of takes a lot of time.
[14774.90s -> 14780.94s]  Like you kind of dedicating a week to go travel and what are you going to do is you're going to
[14780.94s -> 14788.14s]  stream anything during that time. I don't really do IRL content really at all. So it's not like,
[14788.14s -> 14797.21s]  oh, I'm going to go to like PAX East and stream. I'm actually much more comfortable just kind of
[14797.21s -> 14806.31s]  in my own space, if that makes sense. It's funny because I'm, I'm an incredible extrovert
[14807.45s -> 14824.38s]  very selectively. It's kind of weird how that works out. You're a popular loner.
[14832.65s -> 14843.98s]  Don't eat that. I know I wasn't supposed to do that, but I did it anyways.
[14844.54s -> 14862.06s]  Funny Ludwig said that exact thing about you. Really? That's funny. Oh shit. Atriarch, what's
[14862.06s -> 14872.52s]  up? That's it. That's a meaty Atriarch raid. What's going on? Currently in the middle of
[14872.52s -> 14881.43s]  playing. Holy shit. Why did I do that? Oh, did I waste that? Oh, the recharge is insane on that.
[14881.43s -> 14893.78s]  No, I'm good. We're good. Yeah. I'm just chilling out playing some plans for zombies. I played it
[14893.78s -> 14905.42s]  before, but just relax. And on this Tuesday night out of here, this thing's actually awesome.
[14905.42s -> 14917.61s]  I like how it disappears, but disappearing is actually perfect. Are you, are you zonked?
[14917.61s -> 14929.11s]  No, no, no, no. This is way too many mushrooms. It's way too many. Yeah. Atriarch is awesome.
[14929.11s -> 14933.24s]  You don't follow Atriarch. What the heck are you doing?
[14934.20s -> 14948.41s]  Uh, I don't want to lose this. Come on. Hurry up. I really like this thing. I think it's really
[14948.41s -> 14956.82s]  useful. He is zonked. He put the sun shrooms in the front. You don't really want me to put
[14956.82s -> 14963.29s]  them in the front, right? I feel like that's a bad idea. And look what happened when I missed click.
[14964.17s -> 14971.35s]  Sorry. Double defense. Please do your Mitch McConnell impression.
[14971.99s -> 14978.74s]  You know, it's making me laugh about that. It's like, dude, it's, it's like, what time is it
[14978.74s -> 14986.50s]  where you are? It is 11 15 PM here. I wonder what time it is. Are you tired? You want me to do Mitch
[14986.50s -> 14997.03s]  McConnell right now? Isn't it kind of late? It's like too late for that. It's late at 11 15 PM.
[14997.03s -> 14998.47s]  Give us a Mitch McConnell.
[15007.03s -> 15012.31s]  I'm not going to do a Mitch McConnell. What I'm going to do, we're going to have
[15012.31s -> 15017.03s]  plant versus zombies and I'm going to play it and I'm playing it well.
[15026.63s -> 15027.59s]  Worst impression.
[15032.55s -> 15042.49s]  I don't want to hear anything about the stimulus stimulus. Yay. Voices. Hooray.
[15043.45s -> 15051.06s]  You're throwing right now. I don't think I can throw. I think I'm in a good spot.
[15051.06s -> 15064.36s]  When was Mitch McConnell elected? Imagine like looking over in chat and it's like, you know,
[15064.36s -> 15083.37s]  like Mitch McConnell, like 96, just like, fuck you. Oh shit. Oh my God. Oh God. I don't have
[15083.37s -> 15088.81s]  anything here. I had no defense here. Well, we're going to lose the two. I don't know. Whatever.
[15088.81s -> 15095.42s]  It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. Wait, it hasn't happened yet. Can I push him back or
[15095.50s -> 15107.32s]  anything? It hasn't happened yet. I'm still okay. Should be fine. Everybody relax. If I get this,
[15107.32s -> 15117.24s]  it's going to be good. Oh shit. Hold on. Oh, I got it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[15117.24s -> 15126.39s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. I think it's still possible. It's definitely, I got it. Yeah,
[15126.39s -> 15140.17s]  I'm good. Nice. Now do foghorn leg horn. Just rewind two minutes and pretend that's what I
[15140.17s -> 15156.36s]  was doing. A thousand bucks. That's an old pop cap sound. I haven't heard that in a while.
[15159.99s -> 15191.02s]  This is what I want. I told you that's what I was saving for. Cattail. Cattail is going to
[15191.02s -> 15199.74s]  attack any lane and really, I kind of feel like I should have bought that. I feel kind of stupid.
[15200.46s -> 15219.69s]  Do your best second term impression. No, I'm done. I'm not. Is that close? What is this?
[15220.65s -> 15233.61s]  This is courage. The cowardly dog. Yeah. Break it. We're going to base to see what's inside.
[15235.85s -> 15257.70s]  Ooh. Oh shit. Hold on. You just woke everybody up. I probably did that as look at, do you see what
[15257.70s -> 15283.00s]  just happened right there? That was perfect. Wait, they disappear. Please type mustache. I'm about
[15283.00s -> 15309.72s]  to fucking explode. Okay. Don't break them too fast. Get the fuck out of here. They do disappear.
[15310.60s -> 15391.29s]  They do exist. Try that again. Do it one row at a time. That's the strategy. There we go. Okay.
[15391.29s -> 15405.35s]  Very cool. But what's wrong? What the fuck? Why? Why? I'm seeing a lot of question marks.
[15405.35s -> 15455.46s]  Why is everybody? Why the question mark? Go. I'm going to turn. He's going to kill that guy.
[15455.46s -> 15465.34s]  Why you've bonked out of your mind. That's the worst strategy I've ever seen. It's called the
[15465.34s -> 15472.58s]  quick strategy. It's called the strategy that's fast. Just sped it up. You're definitely zooted
[15472.58s -> 15483.27s]  and naked. What's that tweet? That fake ass tweet that somebody put up of like I burnt my nuts with
[15483.27s -> 15487.91s]  a blunt or something. That was a fake ass tweet by the way. I didn't really, I didn't write that.
[15487.91s -> 15508.70s]  That's not real. This goes forward and backwards. Nice. Yeah. Smoking butt naked and just dropped
[15508.70s -> 15521.67s]  the blunt on my balls. I scrum so fucking loud. I didn't, I didn't say this. That's not real tweet.
[15521.67s -> 15530.73s]  Yeah, dude. That actually happened. You just said it though. Yeah. But come on,
[15530.73s -> 15539.53s]  you should just tweet that now and pin it. You know, if you, if I editing tweets, like if I could
[15539.53s -> 15546.17s]  edit tweets from like years ago, part of me just wants me to go edit one from like six years ago
[15546.17s -> 15564.73s]  and just make it that. Whatever. Scrum. Okay. Uh, this is still nighttime. I want to use this.
[15564.73s -> 15579.08s]  This is a fog. I hate this fog. I want to get rid of it so bad. There's no balloons, but this,
[15579.08s -> 15585.10s]  I like this. You know what? I like this better than this. This is not that expensive and you
[15585.10s -> 15595.62s]  can just get rid of everything. I'll try it for now. Take the little green one. All right,
[15595.62s -> 15628.73s]  let's go. How many, uh, worlds are there? I want to say seven or eight. There are five. Oh damn.
[15628.73s -> 15661.80s]  Okay. I beat this night. He thinks he's going to beat it tonight. Why'd you take the two headed?
[15661.80s -> 15674.18s]  Uh, cause it was new and it looked shiny. So I picked it up. Play the mini games too.
[15674.18s -> 15683.53s]  I'll try them for sure. I'm tired, but I don't want to miss the rest of the stream. What do I do?
[15683.53s -> 15690.62s]  Well, I have good news for you. If you like this stream, if you're having a good time,
[15690.94s -> 15695.48s]  there's way, they're going to be way more of these. Don't worry, you can just catch the next one.
[15695.48s -> 15705.24s]  You're just messing up my aesthetic and I hate you. Like he, you know what I mean?
[15705.80s -> 15715.32s]  I, that was perfect symmetry right there and he just messed it up. No, not, I wasn't saying
[15715.32s -> 15727.93s]  that to that person. Oh, you're really messing up my aesthetic right now. What kind of horseshit is
[15727.93s -> 15738.47s]  that? Can you imagine? What a dumb thing to say. Like I, you know what I mean? I, that's not what
[15738.55s -> 15745.26s]  happened. Oh shit. Okay. That's why you need to have this. What the hell? Okay. Well,
[15749.21s -> 15752.01s]  get rid of this, get rid of this fog for a second. I didn't see what's going on here.
[15753.45s -> 15759.29s]  You're eating my shit backwards is annoying. Vibes are officially off.
[15760.97s -> 15771.99s]  Yeah. Vibes are fine. I'm not having a vibe issue right now. It lasts a long time too. I
[15771.99s -> 15790.57s]  like this thing a lot. I need some more stuff down here though. Look at the bottom,
[15790.57s -> 15807.46s]  driven the bottom. I'm good. Okay. All right. He picked the same row, which is good.
[15808.10s -> 15834.55s]  Safe. I want one of these fumes over here. All right. What's this thing?
[15840.70s -> 15848.23s]  You should definitely get the cattails. Star fruit. Shoot stars in five directions.
[15849.11s -> 15852.90s]  Should I put that on a lily pad in the middle? Like right in the middle?
[15853.86s -> 15872.20s]  I feel like that's awesome. I think that's the play. Yeah. And that's the strategy I'm going for.
[15872.20s -> 15884.63s]  I need my lower, maybe one of these. And I think I could work with this. It has to be in the right
[15884.63s -> 15901.21s]  spot or I'm going to lose my mind. Okay. There is. Okay. That looks all right. What are you guys
[15901.21s -> 15922.78s]  doing that face? That's acting weird. Why are you acting so weird? What happened?
[15923.50s -> 15952.79s]  Lillipad going right here. After I set up, after I do some tech. I feel like I want a lot.
[15953.99s -> 15959.48s]  Like this is going to be kind of hard. Who's shooting? I can't tell who's firing.
[15959.48s -> 15982.63s]  Right here. Okay. Yeah. Right here. Just tacking it. Just getting it ready. Okay.
[15983.51s -> 15995.50s]  Who's shooting? You are. All right. Star is going to go here and star going to go here.
[15995.50s -> 16011.80s]  I'll be two stars are going to go in the middle like that because there's a shoot behind too,
[16011.80s -> 16038.15s]  right? Theoretically. Is this a good spot? Kind of. That's works out pretty well. If I do another
[16038.15s -> 16051.34s]  one here and here. Nevermind. He's a stupid nerd. What? What did I do wrong? Oh, why did you say
[16051.34s -> 16071.53s]  that? Now I am a stupid nerd. Look what I did. What happened? Oh, that's sad. These things are
[16071.53s -> 16078.95s]  awesome. I'm never, I'm going to only make these. Do they have to go on a lily pad or can they go
[16078.95s -> 16145.18s]  on anything? Anything, right? They can go on anything. Nice. Okay. Two more here. I don't
[16145.18s -> 16152.86s]  want to neglect the bottom and top. Probably should have deleted this. It's okay. I'm gonna.
[16161.29s -> 16180.84s]  Oh, it's this. The star has that face. I haven't seen you play this game since you
[16180.84s -> 16210.31s]  food yourself. What? What? Then what are you talking about? Oh, that's okay. Oh, yeah. That's
[16210.31s -> 16219.18s]  right. During the Halloween stream. Yeah. Now I know you can. Um, can, can you stars shoot this
[16219.18s -> 16239.94s]  boy, please? They're all missing. Are they not hitting? How come they're not hitting this dude?
[16239.94s -> 16248.20s]  He just screwed everything up. That was a, that was a disaster. They don't hit behind themselves.
[16249.08s -> 16285.05s]  I think I should still make it though. He's scrum and shit himself. God damn it. It's okay.
[16285.05s -> 16314.17s]  Whatever. I miss clicked. Is anybody going to kill this guy? Protect plants that are within the shell.
[16314.17s -> 16334.26s]  Oh, it's like a personal walnut. That's cool. It's still nighttime though. I think I'm gonna do the
[16334.26s -> 16344.94s]  same strategy. There's no, uh, there's no pickaxe people here. So same deal. I don't think I even
[16344.94s -> 16353.06s]  want one of these. I feel like I can cover it with the stars. It'd be wrong. We'll find out.
[16361.16s -> 16373.51s]  Sure. Why not? Star fruit sucks. I think it did pretty well last time.
[16376.79s -> 16404.58s]  Does the pumpkin scale with faith Dala decks? You didn't even ask that question.
[16405.62s -> 16423.14s]  You didn't know that read the game manual, dude, with the rest of us. Can you, is soup a drink?
[16423.54s -> 16443.30s]  Dude, I don't know. I have to restart the, I didn't see this guy soup, a drink. This is the,
[16443.30s -> 16462.57s]  is a hot dog, a sandwich shit, right? I guess kinda. Okay. You know those, um, like when you
[16462.57s -> 16467.69s]  get a ramen, like the, like the cup of noodle thing, it's like the cup and you put the water in it and
[16468.33s -> 16471.05s]  eventually eat all the noodles out of it where you're just kind of drinking it. You're just
[16471.05s -> 16479.21s]  kind of sipping on it. I bet those of you that have had bone broth before you just heat it up
[16479.21s -> 16485.05s]  and you sip it. That's technically a soup, but it's, you can sip on it. It's kind of a nice little
[16485.05s -> 16498.44s]  thing. You guys ever had bone broth before? Yes. You can drink a soup, especially if it's just a
[16498.44s -> 16504.18s]  broth. I think that, I think that makes sense. It's good for you. Bone broth is, bone broth is very
[16504.18s -> 16514.94s]  good for you. Yes. It is very good for you. Just be careful with the salt though. It could be high
[16514.94s -> 16528.82s]  in sodium. Just be careful. Okay. This is also important. Are chips dinner? No. I'm going to
[16528.90s -> 16550.66s]  have to agree with your mother on this one. No, they're not. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Is this
[16550.66s -> 16558.46s]  all right? What did I screw up last time? I don't remember. I screwed something up,
[16558.46s -> 16572.82s]  but I think this is all right. What about nachos? See nachos are not just chips. It's more than that.
[16572.82s -> 16580.18s]  Nachos have sometimes cheese, salsa, sour cream, meat. It's not just a tortilla chip for dinner.
[16580.18s -> 16586.87s]  It covers at least a few food groups. For me, dinner, lunch, dinner, whatever needs to cover
[16587.35s -> 16593.21s]  at least two food groups for it to be like a meal. It has to be at least two food groups.
[16593.21s -> 16603.74s]  So if you had chips and like crumbled on top of the chips was hamburger meat,
[16603.74s -> 16615.88s]  that's not a great meal, but it's still, that would fly for me as sort of food. If you had a hot dog,
[16615.88s -> 16629.86s]  just a single hot dog, I don't think that's a meal. Hot dog and bread. There you go. Cheese and chips.
[16629.86s -> 16641.27s]  I mean, nachos kind of, I mean, technically I just lost again. Actually, no, I didn't. I think I'm
[16641.27s -> 16652.01s]  okay. What about just a steak? No, I don't, I don't find that to be a meal. If you're just going to
[16652.01s -> 16657.45s]  eat a steak and just nothing else on the plate, it's just a cooked steak and that's it. No,
[16657.45s -> 16664.28s]  like mushroom risotto. No, um, you know what I mean? No, nothing else. No, I don't think so.
[16665.86s -> 16686.65s]  Oh, no, like broccolini. You got to have something. What about water? Don't think that's,
[16686.65s -> 16697.02s]  I wouldn't say that's dinner. Please die in this. So I don't have to, you know what? I need to see.
[16697.02s -> 16716.65s]  I got my setup here. What are you doing? Um, you just jump over shit and I've, it's okay. I don't
[16716.65s -> 16720.97s]  care about this. It's fine. It's fine. I'll be all right. We don't need to get a hundred percent on
[16720.97s -> 16767.67s]  every level. Who's being eaten? Waste, wasteful, very wasteful. That's okay. Partably wasteful.
[16768.23s -> 16795.86s]  You're not going to actually die. All right. Okay. Careful. That was 3 a.m. Yeah. I don't think I'm
[16795.86s -> 16809.59s]  going to go much longer. See if I can maybe get to the last zone. Maybe I'm going to say I was
[16809.59s -> 16834.30s]  about to put that down. I think I'm good. Yeah, we're good. Don't let that guy win. Keep streaming.
[16837.74s -> 16849.06s]  Ooh, that's nice. Don't let that guy win. That guy is probably going to bed. It's probably like
[16849.70s -> 16859.90s]  five o'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the morning or something. Don't be a coward.
[16859.90s -> 16863.75s]  No, I'm good. I think we'll probably beat it tonight. At least get through the fifth
[16863.75s -> 16871.93s]  zone. They just said it was 3 a.m. Aren't you the guy that eats mayo from the jar?
[16874.28s -> 16881.22s]  Um, I don't. I like mayo. I think it goes great with a lot of stuff, especially with tuna fish
[16881.22s -> 16888.70s]  and pretzels. I wonder how many people actually think I'm a disgusting piece of shit. And then
[16888.70s -> 16893.27s]  they go, you know what? Just for the meme, I'm going to do it one day. Just for the meme, like
[16893.27s -> 16895.67s]  all of you guys are hanging out. There's like a thousand of you. There's like a hundred of you
[16895.67s -> 16899.62s]  in this thing. It's like, I don't know, fucking dance hall or wherever you are. And you make a
[16899.62s -> 16903.30s]  big vat of this and it's like, oh yeah, remember when he said this? We're going to do it for the
[16903.30s -> 16907.64s]  meme and it's going to become your favorite snack. And you're not going to, you're not going to say
[16907.64s -> 16913.38s]  shit, are you? You're not going to say shit. You're going to be like, oh, it's delicious,
[16913.38s -> 16923.10s]  but I can't say that. Make tuna fish with mayo, slop it, you know, slop it up a little bit,
[16923.10s -> 16930.04s]  get it in the bowl and then get pretzel rods, dip it in, dunk it like a dunkaroo and bite it.
[16930.04s -> 16945.37s]  And I want you to report back. I really want you to report back. Tuna. I already, there's a
[16945.37s -> 16958.17s]  lot of people writing. It's guys. Nobody said, why the fuck are you eating gruel? You don't,
[16958.17s -> 16970.71s]  is that what you think about tuna fish? You think tuna fish is gruel? Come on. What? It's not gruel.
[16975.10s -> 16981.99s]  All I'm saying is give it a try. Look, if you don't like tuna fish, then you're obviously going to
[16981.99s -> 16988.34s]  hate this. I grew up on tuna fish. I grew up on tuna fish sandwiches.
[16996.06s -> 17009.72s]  Shit. I sound like I have a shit face. You kids don't always like, I grew up on tuna fish sandwiches
[17009.72s -> 17023.67s]  and they were fucking delicious. Look how I turned out you little shits. Okay, let's go. This is the
[17023.67s -> 17038.87s]  last level. Should I take the smush? I don't really like these, not for here. I'll try this though.
[17038.87s -> 17050.34s]  Tuna sandwich and a can of ginger ale, mega comfort food. Leather jacket said that. Oh man,
[17050.34s -> 17060.41s]  that sounds pretty great. A nice fresh ginger ale tuna sandwich with like a piece of Swiss
[17060.41s -> 17069.42s]  cheese on it. Even a tuna melt or something. Tuna melts. Oh, maybe a little bit. Maybe get a
[17069.42s -> 17085.72s]  little wild, put a little bit of avocado on it. You know what I mean? Tuna melts are really good.
[17085.72s -> 17092.62s]  I know there's a lot of people that really don't like fish at all and I get it. But to me,
[17092.62s -> 17099.19s]  tuna fish is barely even fish. Maybe it's because I was just so used to it growing up eating it.
[17099.19s -> 17108.42s]  I had it all the time. It was not, oh this, it's fish. I know that sounds weird to say that,
[17108.42s -> 17114.94s]  but it doesn't feel like it's fish. It feels like it's just like food. I'm explaining this really
[17114.94s -> 17138.30s]  wrong. What about pickles? Yeah. Who's spiring? Okay, you guys are fine. It tastes like chicken.
[17138.30s -> 17143.18s]  Yeah, it just, especially when you, if you add a little bit of no pickles or relish or something,
[17143.18s -> 17150.20s]  a little bit of cheese. I think people, tuna fish, obviously you don't want to eat it all
[17150.20s -> 17156.12s]  the fucking time because tuna has mercury and can't have mercury. Can't have too much mercury.
[17158.52s -> 17166.33s]  You get it. But it's really easy. You can get a bunch of tuna and then here's the good thing
[17166.33s -> 17171.90s]  about tuna from like can, right? Just regular, just regular ass tuna. Nothing crazy. It lasts
[17171.90s -> 17180.22s]  a really long time and you can just get a bunch of it and you can make a full meal with a can of
[17180.22s -> 17220.17s]  this shit. I gotta be ready here. Don't eat that. Where are you? Okay, this is all right. How about
[17220.17s -> 17238.46s]  this? Get that hat off. Wait, how close does that have to be? It's not metal? Oh, I thought it took,
[17238.46s -> 17249.94s]  I thought it was metal and hats. I thought it was hats. It's plastic. Yeah, but I thought it
[17249.94s -> 17292.31s]  was like removes hats. Should be all right. This middle row. I'm good. Oops, sorry. Take that hat
[17292.31s -> 17304.22s]  off. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Can he float over that?
[17305.77s -> 17325.86s]  Wait, blow away. What am I thinking? What a waste. I'm sorry. That was dumb. I'm still fine. Gotta
[17325.86s -> 17346.90s]  take care of this bottom row here. Take this hat off. This is, this is metal. This is made out of
[17346.90s -> 17379.67s]  fucking aluminum. I think it's so good. So many of these assholes too. I started, yeah, I started
[17379.67s -> 17392.55s]  pretty late. No real plan with this one. Just kind of felt like turning it on, which expect way more
[17392.55s -> 17403.43s]  of these. I know I keep saying that, but I really like this shit. I do. I did miss it a lot. Don't
[17403.43s -> 17434.17s]  eat that. I put in here to get something in the way. This second to last row has nothing on it.
[17434.17s -> 17479.03s]  I'm going to hold that for now. You got to be close. Jesus. All right. World four done.
[17480.07s -> 17497.35s]  Look at that. Only one more world. Yeah. This is your mother. Please come over to my house for
[17497.35s -> 17502.47s]  meatloaf. Leave your front door open and your lawn unguarded. This is not the zombies.
[17505.70s -> 17510.97s]  I think it's so dark. It can't be good. Oh, well hope you survive the night.
[17511.93s -> 17531.59s]  Do you guys like meatloaf? Meatloaf sucks. Unless your mom makes it. That's just a fact. I think.
[17535.11s -> 17555.56s]  Come on. Let me see. Okay. It's right there. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. I said the same thing
[17555.56s -> 17595.11s]  five years ago. It's true. This can go anywhere. Don't crunch. Oh, I hear the crunches.
[17595.99s -> 17636.81s]  Oh shit. Motherfuckers down here. Oh my God. Dr. Clay just linked a fucking sandwich and the thing
[17636.81s -> 17648.52s]  looks awesome. Holy shit. Turkey sub with everything on it. Oh, that sounds awesome.
[17657.03s -> 17662.60s]  He goes, Oh, whoops. Sorry about that. No, that's not good. With everything on it. Oh, you know,
[17662.60s -> 17664.60s]  when everything's on it, that's going to be, you know, it's going to be good.
[17666.57s -> 17676.44s]  Get that thing stacked up. Lettuce, pickles, mayo, cheese and shit. Get everything on that.
[17677.00s -> 17683.27s]  And I want it to be, I want the lettuce to be falling out of the outside of the bun.
[17683.27s -> 17712.09s]  It's fucked up. What happened to that one? What? A lot of these lily pads. I don't really want them
[17712.09s -> 17751.22s]  anymore. Okay. Not a bad setup. Yeah. I don't think there's anything better. How should I use this?
[17751.22s -> 17785.50s]  Maybe flying right now. Use the blower to get rid of it. I missed it. Hey, he's dead. Okay.
[17785.50s -> 17852.68s]  Is there any space for anything? Show me. Shit. This top water lane needs a, give me a blower.
[17853.24s -> 17857.35s]  Give me a blower. Give me a blower before I'm in trouble. Give me a blower. Give me a blower.
[17859.35s -> 17894.17s]  Place it. Yes. I got it. This is almost a full stack of shit here. Any more flying people? No.
[17903.37s -> 17912.17s]  Ooh. A cabbage thrower. What was that achievement? Or else cabbages at the enemy.
[17916.26s -> 17920.42s]  They even found a way onto your roof. Those are some persistent zombies, dude.
[17921.86s -> 17928.50s]  Use the cabbage pulse. Okay. You can finish the game in one sitting.
[17930.79s -> 17941.88s]  Yeah. I think that's probably accurate. I don't know what that thing is, but it's kind of scary.
[17942.60s -> 17951.64s]  I'm going to drive people crazy with this, by the way. I'm only taking this,
[17954.52s -> 17969.02s]  and I'm going to drive some of you crazy. Okay. So we got cabbage, triple shooter. Does this work
[17969.02s -> 18001.91s]  here? Squasher. Uh, boom, boom. Uh, boom, boom. Um, boom. No, boom. No. I'm already getting
[18001.91s -> 18039.13s]  luigied. Yeah. That's what I want to do. I was just joking around. Oh, right. You have to put it
[18039.13s -> 18079.05s]  on a sunflower. Oh, yeah. Oh, I can only put it in this many slots. This game sucks. Oh, Megalo true.
[18084.02s -> 18085.74s]  What? Oh, that's annoying.
[18106.23s -> 18120.46s]  Cool. I know people are going to say, stop doing this. Just let me do it. I want, I want a million
[18120.46s -> 18154.22s]  sun. Okay. Almost. All right. Now we double all of these. Oh, fuck. Right. Oops. I think it's okay.
[18157.93s -> 18178.86s]  It's not okay. What's that?
[18182.06s -> 18226.58s]  That same enemy is in Sekiro. Can you shoot? Is this working? Is it hitting the ground? Oh shit.
[18226.58s -> 18231.93s]  I think it's hitting the ground. Can you only use the cabbage?
[18232.73s -> 18260.41s]  Oh shit. Okay. Well, that's good to know. Is there any way I can stop that from happening? That sucks.
[18275.93s -> 18306.78s]  Shit. I want to get all of them. Well, now I know. Extra pot. You don't have lawnmowers.
[18308.30s -> 18357.05s]  Interesting. I get this. Only losers get that. What did it do? So it's only the cabbages can hurt
[18357.05s -> 18380.87s]  anything. And the squisher. These can't shoot up. The cat is OP. The front most plants can attack.
[18380.87s -> 18405.13s]  Then let's fucking go. Pumpkin will protect the grab. Oh, good. That's good to know. If I don't do
[18405.13s -> 18461.91s]  it this time, I'll do it. We're going to hold off. I got an interesting plan here. That turkey
[18461.91s -> 18485.83s]  sandwich looked fucking awesome. It really did. He loves tuna sandwiches. Oh, sorry. No, no, no. I
[18485.83s -> 18490.04s]  got the squisher. This is why you bring the squisher every time. There's no reason to ever
[18490.04s -> 18499.21s]  take this off your loadout ever. An instant kill and it's only 50 cents. So good.
[18501.37s -> 18516.62s]  Landmine is better. The landmine is a little cheaper, but it takes too long to arm if you
[18516.62s -> 18523.16s]  really are in a pinch and you really need to get out of there. Squisher is your friend.
[18523.16s -> 18543.29s]  This is definitely pre-recorded. You're definitely naked and watching the VOD right now.
[18543.29s -> 18570.52s]  Like with you guys based. What you guys don't know is at the end of the stream,
[18570.52s -> 18574.44s]  I forgot to like make, I forgot to make sure the stream turned off. I fell asleep here
[18575.16s -> 18601.34s]  and the video just starts over again. Okay. Let me get this right. I'm not going to let you do that.
[18603.74s -> 18609.18s]  Wrong lane. You idiot. I thought it was. Oh, I thought he was at the top. Shit.
[18610.46s -> 18617.80s]  This is why the smusher is the best thing. Look at this. He's not going to let you get by.
[18618.68s -> 18637.88s]  Get out of here. It would be way more effort for you to pretend to play than to just play.
[18637.88s -> 18654.71s]  Yeah. That's what I'm saying. How much of a fraud do you guys think I am? There we go. Perfect
[18654.71s -> 18690.01s]  placement. I'm good. Detective stream was a neat idea. You know, that's one of my favorite streams.
[18690.73s -> 18702.07s]  That's one of my favorite things I've ever done. I had so much fun on that night.
[18702.79s -> 18719.93s]  I don't know if there's not a lot of people that don't know what we're talking about, but
[18721.32s -> 18727.56s]  five years ago, we recorded a whole stream and the whole goal was I had a bunch of fake accounts
[18727.56s -> 18733.61s]  that were me and I was just typing in the chat, watching the VOD with everybody on fake accounts
[18734.33s -> 18740.17s]  and every like 30 minutes or so, every 20 minutes, the video would stop and an alarm would sound and
[18740.17s -> 18748.95s]  everybody had 10 seconds to guess who I was in the chat. I don't think we could do that again.
[18748.95s -> 18758.34s]  I think there's too many people here now. That was back. That was where there a thousand viewers or
[18758.34s -> 18768.89s]  something. 1500 or something. I don't know if that would work very well now. Like three K.
[18769.85s -> 18800.23s]  Leave my shit alone. I had a great name too. One of my favorite names. What was it? Binary Man
[18800.23s -> 18814.87s]  0010110001. I forget what some of the other ones were. I had like seven or eight, didn't I?
[18820.52s -> 18839.14s]  Oh, corn. That's the worst joke of all time. I don't think so. I thought it was fun.
[18849.21s -> 18859.80s]  I'm happy with this. Even less. That kind of sucks.
[18859.96s -> 18875.86s]  Everyone, you did a rebroadcast of the Simpsons hit and run.
[18877.90s -> 18882.68s]  And I wouldn't just let it play. I kept showing up and pausing it and being like,
[18882.68s -> 18887.64s]  oh, let me tell you about this. I remember people screaming at me, just saying,
[18887.64s -> 18906.12s]  get the fuck out of here. We're trying to watch this corn go first. It's just the butter, right?
[18906.92s -> 18915.98s]  Or is it, is it butter or is it kernels? Find out. It's butter, right? Oh no, it's kernels.
[18916.38s -> 18941.66s]  I thought I had like a pad of butter. Oh, it is Baltica. You're going to eat the pot?
[18941.66s -> 18958.66s]  Get out of here. You just made me waste 25 cents for the pre-recorded webcam bit from Hotline Miami.
[18960.33s -> 18983.93s]  Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't even remember what that was. You kept talking while you were drinking.
[18985.42s -> 18991.90s]  Oh, that's right. Yeah. Cause I recorded like 10 minutes straight of webcam footage
[18992.46s -> 19000.04s]  and just looped it in the corner of the screen. What the hell am I? What the hell is wrong with me?
[19012.95s -> 19021.10s]  Don't. Did I just really kill him? I did, didn't I? Come on. What the fuck? This guy's super human.
[19021.10s -> 19054.79s]  You're super human. Why are you still alive? I'm going to die. And then the next one I'm going to
[19054.79s -> 19087.85s]  get killed by. I don't think I'm prepared, but we'll see what happens. Is this too much corn?
[19088.81s -> 19104.95s]  Are you sleepy? Um, I don't, I'm a little bit tired, but I'm okay. I figured a bit,
[19104.95s -> 19107.91s]  probably at the end of this, I'll maybe try a mini game or two and then take off.
[19109.75s -> 19157.85s]  Did I miss a dime? Whatever that is. I'm just doing all corn, corn only. You know,
[19157.85s -> 19167.69s]  actually I'm not a huge corn fan. I love, I love the corn is in something, you know, like corn meal,
[19167.69s -> 19174.86s]  like corn tortillas, but I'm, I don't know. I'm not like a, just an ear of corn.
[19174.86s -> 19183.96s]  I have to be really in the mood for it, but that's not good.
[19194.17s -> 19198.50s]  Corn on the cob can be good, but I need to really, really want it.
[19201.10s -> 19208.23s]  I just don't like what it does to your teeth. It seems like every single space between every single
[19208.23s -> 19214.07s]  tooth has like paper stuck in it after you eat corn. It's just like,
[19215.27s -> 19225.32s]  I love the way it tastes, but it's just kind of annoying. I don't know why I just did that,
[19225.32s -> 19252.10s]  but okay. Why is this ladder still here? Nope. What? You didn't even climb over the big ones?
[19254.55s -> 19263.45s]  Yeah, I didn't know that. Then they can climb over them. That's annoying.
[19268.04s -> 19291.50s]  Washroom to wake it up. Wake it up. I mean, I can use, oh,
[19300.76s -> 19310.73s]  kind of like the setup I had. I don't think there's anything I really want from here.
[19311.45s -> 19331.53s]  Bring the magnet. Yeah. I don't think I want to do that. I'll stick with what I was doing.
[19331.53s -> 19371.59s]  I think it was better. Oh, that's right. No squish. It's okay. We'll deal. We'll deal with it.
[19371.59s -> 19396.58s]  Magnet is a shroom. Oh, that's right. I'll deal with it. Does the cabbage do more damage than the
[19396.58s -> 19407.10s]  corn? I have to imagine it probably does because the corn is a slow stun. I probably need a few
[19407.10s -> 19423.99s]  more of those then. I did way too much corn last time. It does pea shooter damage.
[19424.47s -> 19470.90s]  Good to know. You got to go. I don't have my smush. It's done. Done. Done. Nice. Done again.
[19471.70s -> 19496.68s]  It's done again. Yes. This has got three. This is going to be tricky. This game won a Grammy
[19496.68s -> 19500.36s]  for its soundtrack. I mean, the soundtrack does go really hard. It's a really good soundtrack.
[19501.48s -> 19523.75s]  I got to have at least two in each row. Bro, why are you streaming right now?
[19524.55s -> 19550.44s]  Just hanging out. I'm going down here. It was unironically added to the Library of Congress.
[19551.08s -> 19556.07s]  Didn't you guys give me shit for that before? As you said, that CARS 2 is in the Library of
[19556.07s -> 19566.94s]  Congress and there was a bunch of people laughing about it. I made some arguments saying, no, no,
[19566.94s -> 19570.94s]  you don't understand. This is in the Library of Congress. And people were like, yeah, bro,
[19570.94s -> 19593.46s]  CARS 2 is as well. Done. Can we get a stun? Everything is in the Library of Congress. It's
[19593.46s -> 19602.97s]  true. You know what's funny? I've never seen a single CARS movie. If you said I'll give you
[19602.97s -> 19606.65s]  a million dollars if you can name three characters in that movie, I wouldn't be able to do it. I
[19606.65s -> 19618.76s]  wouldn't be able to name you two. I think I can name you one. I could not name you more than two
[19618.76s -> 19650.01s]  people in that movie. I've never seen any of the CARS movies. None of them. All right. This is
[19650.01s -> 19664.15s]  where I got to be prepared. Pretty good setup. Some, uh, walnuts here. Ah, give me that.
[19671.37s -> 19681.80s]  He's dead. Nevermind. Would you rather be the head of lettuce or a raw ear of corn?
[19681.80s -> 19685.64s]  Is it a raw ear of corn hard? Maybe that kind of hurts. Break your teeth or something. No.
[19686.60s -> 19713.30s]  Oh, they're like really kind of like so fresh and frisk. I'm going to have to disagree.
[19715.38s -> 19732.57s]  Sorry. There's a whole nother wave coming too. I think it's just protect and that's it. Can I
[19732.57s -> 19758.87s]  put a pumpkin on a walnut? I can. Okay. That's cool. Oh, give that to me. Oh, I got really,
[19758.87s -> 19774.81s]  oh, I got really cocky. I got really cocky. I have to replace this shit. Come on. It's okay.
[19778.39s -> 19784.55s]  Just kill them. Dude, you're not actually going to fucking asshole.
[19789.18s -> 19851.77s]  You get out of here. He's ruining everything. They're all getting through. How are you still
[19851.77s -> 19864.15s]  alive? This is making any sense. Die. Oh my goodness. Oh, suck that thing out of his hands.
[19865.05s -> 19869.45s]  Oh, this thing is a mushroom. I forgot. Oh no. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[19876.47s -> 19896.34s]  Uh, I'm going to, I'm still going to be fine. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh shit. Everything needs to
[19896.34s -> 19902.38s]  be clicked on. That's all right. I don't care. I don't have to 100% it's fine. Get run over.
[19902.38s -> 19911.13s]  You'd be really bad at Starcraft. Yeah. I'm never going to play Starcraft, man.
[19911.13s -> 19929.64s]  That sounds like a bad idea. Now you can play Zen garden mode. A couple of sprouts.
[19937.02s -> 19950.04s]  Money. How much should I do this for? Can I just do this forever? It's 10 bucks every time.
[19950.04s -> 19976.02s]  Your plant needs fertilizer. Visit the shop, pick up some fertilizer. Oh dear. That's pretty
[19976.02s -> 19991.18s]  good. I mean, I feel like I don't want to buy that right now. Nah. He gave me some for free.
[19991.18s -> 20010.28s]  Zen garden is pretty nifty, huh? You can visit it at any time from the main menu.
[20011.29s -> 20014.41s]  End your house. I have to warn you. You're going to hate this next level.
[20014.97s -> 20028.28s]  It's nonstop bungee zombie after bungee zombie. I hate those. All right. So I need the strategy here
[20028.28s -> 20045.06s]  is. Oh, okay. I have to use it. Oh, I can do this. Chopper.
[20075.50s -> 20080.54s]  Is he going to be chewed by the time he gets over here?
[20080.54s -> 20120.50s]  Oh, my goodness. You just eat him already.
[20178.42s -> 20217.24s]  They have bigger range. Hey, cool. You have bombs. I'm saving them. Hey. Oh, they get eaten though.
[20225.82s -> 20229.62s]  Look at that guy over here.
[20235.02s -> 20245.70s]  Somebody eat him. Somebody eat him. What is happening? Eat this guy.
[20245.70s -> 20292.58s]  That's the strategy right there. I'm going to do that. Yeah, I got this. It's in the bag. It's
[20292.58s -> 20327.66s]  already. I win. I had to do that. Everything's good. Okay. This is where I go. Boom, boom, boom.
[20327.66s -> 20343.80s]  Three times, four times.
[20354.87s -> 20363.08s]  Looks good. One of you has to stop chewing here in a second, right?
[20365.32s -> 20402.10s]  All right. Here we go. Here we go. Nice. They really be crunching.
[20402.74s -> 20419.62s]  Convert zombies into other lanes. Catapult zombie. What the hell does that mean? I got
[20419.62s -> 20445.59s]  fucking golly dude. Come on. All right. Just that. I'll try it. Convert into other lanes so
[20445.59s -> 20456.41s]  it'll move up or down. Does it choose a path or do I have to pick it? Oh, he said it. He said the
[20456.41s -> 20489.61s]  thing. It's random. Put them all the way at the end. Two tears of double sun. I feel like I'm
[20489.61s -> 20494.73s]  probably going to need that eventually, but not immediately. Maybe like the next three levels at
[20494.73s -> 20521.91s]  the end of the game. Dude, you're totally gaming right now. Yeah. The garlic in the top and bottom
[20521.91s -> 20567.88s]  row, like all the way back here as a defense. You have to eat it. Oh shit. I'm going to do three
[20567.88s -> 20592.26s]  cabbage and then one corn. I think that'll be good. Are you winning son? Yeah, dad. Oh, good.
[20592.26s -> 20620.65s]  I need three rows of cabbages or I'll quit the game. That's what I require.
[20622.15s -> 20640.95s]  This is stupid. Was it dumb to like tech this whole time just to get cabbages or is that?
[20640.95s -> 20645.45s]  I think I'm all right. I don't know what this thing, what this guy does though. I put it,
[20645.45s -> 20668.33s]  I'm going to make, I'm going to put it. Should I squish him? Found a solution. Kill him. Come on.
[20668.33s -> 20677.86s]  Kill him. He's not going to kill my sunflowers, right? You are such a dick. I can't believe that.
[20677.86s -> 20686.06s]  That was 150 bucks. That's a, that's actually bad. It's going to set me behind.
[20688.06s -> 20709.24s]  Okay. I got all the rows. I want a cabbage. This is where I got to get ready. It might just be,
[20709.24s -> 20717.80s]  I'm going to do one row of corn. That's it. What's the difference? Corn does less damage
[20717.80s -> 20722.12s]  than cabbage, but has a random chance to throw a big thing of butter, which stuns them like that.
[20722.76s -> 20770.68s]  It's pretty useful. Stun him. Stun him. Stun him. Sorry. Not that bad. What are your thoughts on
[20770.68s -> 20821.10s]  corn? Corn is really good. Yeah, it is. Ah, I see. It buys you a little time too. It's good. I'm
[20821.10s -> 20831.34s]  going to sneeze. I'm so sorry. I probably woke up like a thousand people. I'm sorry.
[20831.34s -> 20836.68s]  There was no escaping that. It was just coming out. I tried to look away from the microphone too.
[20837.83s -> 20842.55s]  I, this is supposed to be chill night. I just probably scared the shit out of like a million
[20842.55s -> 20861.94s]  of you. Ooh. Okay. Protect nearby plants. Is that, do they have to be touching or is it just in a
[20861.94s -> 20881.99s]  square kind of adjacent squares? The three by three. Okay. I'll try it. Order. Come on.
[20887.62s -> 20910.25s]  I remember when he said stimulus. That was a little more put together though. That was not
[20910.25s -> 20940.23s]  quite it. Final three levels. Let's go. I didn't tech last time and I think it was a problem.
[20940.79s -> 20948.79s]  I'm going to focus on that right now. We're doing double lane of flowers by the way, even if it
[20948.79s -> 20953.94s]  ruins everything. Cause I can kill this one and I can kill that one and then go forward from there.
[20989.27s -> 20994.07s]  Yeah. Now this is going to be unbelievable. I'm going to stack at least a few of these
[20995.22s -> 21031.46s]  and I'll be in the money. Look at this. This is going to be awesome. It's going to be good.
[21034.79s -> 21079.32s]  Your economy is doing great right now. Thanks dude. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.
[21085.53s -> 21148.58s]  Come on. Where's my economy? Where's the economy? Get that shit out of here. Placement.
[21150.58s -> 21207.69s]  Look at all this money. It's just piling in right now. Come on. Die. Die. Jesus. Okay.
[21208.73s -> 21244.42s]  He's blowing it. No, I'm not. I'm good. I'm not blowing it. I didn't blow it. There's so much
[21244.42s -> 21248.26s]  damage here. Look at this. An unbelievable amount of damage here. I'm doing fine.
[21249.22s -> 21282.46s]  I'm like, I'm running out of room to quit shit. You need to optimize your strategy. I'm
[21282.46s -> 21298.87s]  looking, no one's even getting close. No one's even come close. Look at, I got a thousand bucks.
[21298.87s -> 21305.62s]  Go ahead and take it. What is that? Oh my God. It's a thousand dollars. Wait, why did I preemptively
[21305.62s -> 21324.68s]  say that? Oh, cause I had a thousand dollars. Right. No, I want you to hit this guy. He must
[21324.68s -> 21345.94s]  be pissy in that. Oh, what the fuck? More money than you could even count.
[21347.22s -> 21365.70s]  I got care. I've got $800. I don't care. All right. Big wave coming. I don't think I need to do
[21365.70s -> 21397.77s]  anything. You know what? Fuck it. This one, I don't even need it. Damage only. That was clean. Very
[21397.77s -> 21414.28s]  clean. If you were a plant, what would you be? Um, like Olivera. Gives you silver and gold coins.
[21417.93s -> 21443.14s]  Oh dude, you're dead. I don't think so. I'm happy with that strategy. I think it works fine.
[21443.14s -> 21452.92s]  Smush. No, I got to work on the economy first. Especially with a big guy like this.
[21472.97s -> 21477.03s]  You would be a cactus. Probably. You're right. All right. I think this is good. Let's go.
[21477.03s -> 21487.82s]  Only one more level after this. Damn. All right. I'm going to beat this tonight.
[21487.82s -> 21494.65s]  I feel like I've been playing pretty well. I feel like I've been pretty locked in.
[21494.65s -> 21526.74s]  I don't think I failed one mission. Maybe one. Look at this economy. The restarts don't count.
[21526.74s -> 21534.94s]  No, they do. Economy. I had a huge economy last time and it was the reason why I won.
[21553.02s -> 21562.50s]  Come on. This game is really fun. Why didn't they just make more of these?
[21563.30s -> 21565.86s]  I feel like there's so much more they could have probably done with this franchise
[21566.74s -> 21572.01s]  in this way. Not in the FPS way or the shooter way. I would have loved to have done
[21573.05s -> 21580.06s]  late like Plants vs Zombies again. Yeah, I mean Plants vs Zombies 2 got a bunch of updates and
[21580.06s -> 21590.06s]  stuff, but it was just a regular standalone game. Okay, let's go. All right. Time to go.
[21591.74s -> 21604.50s]  There's not going to be any real rhyme or reason to the placement. People are going to be pissed
[21604.50s -> 21621.19s]  about it, but it's okay. Just as they come up. I have a lot of money. It's coming up.
[21621.19s -> 21625.02s]  Symmetry is going to suck, but it's okay. Same damage. Same stuff happening.
[21625.66s -> 21633.38s]  Did you get it out there? Bottom row. Come on. I got to quickly get this built.
[21654.15s -> 21664.36s]  Draw a dick with the pots. Have I just started doing that?
[21665.74s -> 21697.05s]  No, I'm not going to do that. Get over here. Get rid of him. First test. Okay. What is it?
[21710.33s -> 21757.78s]  Not bad. Not a terrible wave. Oh, big guy. Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on over here?
[21757.78s -> 21808.09s]  Uh-oh. What? No. Okay. It's fine. Come on. Come on. Come on. We're good. Nice. Don's cap on.
[21808.89s -> 21814.50s]  I saved that. I didn't. No one more has got hit there. What are you talking about?
[21828.68s -> 21835.48s]  Holly can't sleep because Gerva keeps playing TVC at full volume at 1 a.m.
[21836.12s -> 21854.81s]  I'm being really quiet though. Okay. Here it comes. All right. Wherever the big guy is,
[21854.81s -> 21877.10s]  that's where I put this thing. Where's the big guy down here? He squished it.
[21878.94s -> 21914.36s]  He actually smushed it. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Come on. Damn it. Die. Oh, no. Crash him. Yes.
[21915.00s -> 21948.42s]  Five, nine. Coming up. Heavy damage to groups of zombies. Should I just only do those? I think
[21948.42s -> 21959.56s]  I'm just going to go ultra tech and only do watermelons. Watermelons and corn only.
[21959.56s -> 21985.77s]  It's pretty pricey. That's what the corn is for. What am I doing? Of course. Okay. Here we go.
[21985.77s -> 21994.81s]  Let's go. This is it. I think there's only one more level after this and it's like a
[21994.81s -> 22002.02s]  minigame level, right? If I can make some money early, then this should work out fine.
[22014.68s -> 22029.18s]  This is the original Plants vs. Zombies. The second one is the Game of the Year edition. I
[22029.18s -> 22054.60s]  don't know if they added anything or what that means. All right. Come on. First economy. Come on.
[22054.60s -> 22082.49s]  That doesn't mean anything. I didn't expect it to. Just more content. Will you play Zumbinis ever
[22082.49s -> 22103.93s]  again? It's funny you say that. I think I have it installed right now. Play it tonight? We can play
[22103.93s -> 22121.37s]  Zumbinis again if you want. I'm down for that. Sure. Not tonight, but eventually. All right.
[22121.37s -> 22134.30s]  We got a row of corn. Row of watermelon. There's no way they can buy. Remind me to protect the
[22134.30s -> 22175.43s]  watermelons because I will forget. Need something down here. Where the big wave shows up. Here we
[22175.43s -> 22196.76s]  go. Nice. Okay. Not a bad spot. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I need to get at least three
[22196.76s -> 22206.62s]  here. There it is. Nice. All right. Right in the middle. I'm going to do another row of corn.
[22207.98s -> 22242.65s]  No. No, not. Only watermelon. They can't even walk up here. Hey, can you please react harder?
[22243.78s -> 22281.67s]  Sorry, man. Another row of watermelon. I have a little bit of time. Protect them first. I will.
[22281.67s -> 22310.70s]  Look at this economy back here. That's not happening. Sorry. Don't you dare. Took so long.
[22311.64s -> 22330.47s]  Please. Shit. Right at the end. You piece of shit. Whatever. It's fine. Good luck getting
[22330.47s -> 22398.38s]  over here. All right. Big wave. I need this. No. Okay. If I get two rows of watermelons,
[22398.38s -> 22411.43s]  it's game over. It just is. Getting watermelon launched to your head must really hurt.
[22412.79s -> 22435.56s]  Yeah. Big watermelons are doing way a lot. Get him out of the way. All right. Get in there.
[22435.56s -> 22485.24s]  Okay. That's it. That's it. No more upgrading. All right. Good. Hey, German, can you crush a
[22485.24s -> 22499.03s]  watermelon between your thighs? Sorry. Sorry, dude. I don't think that's happening. All right. This is
[22499.03s -> 22529.14s]  it. Come on. Launch. When he launches out, I'm going to crush him. I did it. All right. Now,
[22529.14s -> 22558.81s]  it's the wind. I already come on. Keep them frozen. Keep them frozen. That look. Oh, shit.
[22560.46s -> 22576.33s]  No. Come on. I'm not. My click speed isn't fast enough. Yes. The clutch. Squash with the clutch.
[22577.61s -> 22589.80s]  Homeowner, you have failed to submit to our rightful claim. Be advised that unless you comply,
[22590.36s -> 22596.70s]  we're forced to take extreme action. Please something. Your home and brains to us now.
[22596.70s -> 22607.94s]  Sincerely, Jean-Pierre. Uh-oh. He's here. Ready to get ready. Every one heck of a fight. His
[22607.94s -> 22646.98s]  weakness is even the pancreas. Dave. Uh-oh. It is Dave. All right. All right. Here we go.
[22647.62s -> 22661.02s]  It's the last level, right? No. Use it early. Use it early. Use it early so I can get a good,
[22661.02s -> 22666.57s]  you know what I mean? Use it early. Watermelon going right in the middle. Perfect lane already.
[22669.80s -> 22694.62s]  Not dealing with that. Not dealing with this right now. What the fuck? Should I attack him?
[22695.18s -> 22707.75s]  Wait. Freeze. Ooh, that hurts a lot. Okay. What do I do about that? What the fuck do I do about
[22707.75s -> 22717.53s]  that? What the fuck do I do about that? He just crushed everything. What? What the hell? He just
[22717.53s -> 22724.07s]  rolled a fucking like blueberry snowball at me and it killed everything. What the hell happened?
[22724.87s -> 22764.18s]  I need to use fire. Oh, that makes sense. Okay. I've got a pretty good thing here. But this works.
[22769.30s -> 22804.44s]  Oh, slowest clicker in the entire world, by the way. Not putting up with that. All right. Focus
[22804.44s -> 22836.60s]  fire. Freeze. I need ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice. Now what? That's unfair. It's kind of a dick move.
[22852.65s -> 22878.25s]  What bullshit are you going to do now? Fire, ice. Yeah. Almost halfway. Didn't take any
[22878.25s -> 22896.33s]  watermelons. Good. Kind of running out of. Wrong. It was a waste, but it's okay. It's not a huge
[22896.33s -> 22925.34s]  problem. That's okay. He should die right now. We got fire. Probably should just freeze him again.
[22932.23s -> 22957.54s]  Hey, that was fucked up. That was annoying. What the? Freeze. I need some more shit. Dude,
[22957.54s -> 22993.26s]  come on. Give me something besides the hot and the cold. Oh, Jesus. Okay. What are you going to do?
[22993.26s -> 23014.68s]  Ice, fire. What is it? My teeth just came out. My fake teeth just came out of my mouth when I said
[23014.68s -> 23046.01s]  that. My dentures just flew out. There's nobody even in this lane. Shit. Freeze, freeze, freeze,
[23046.01s -> 23083.51s]  freeze, freeze. Oh, goodness. I hope you don't. Oh, please don't do ice. Fire, fire. Oh, I can't
[23083.51s -> 23095.66s]  click correctly. I can't. I can't click correctly. I can't. I just, it's like,
[23097.58s -> 23126.68s]  it's okay. I'm so close. No, this guy died already. This is the wrong lane. You don't.
[23127.40s -> 23181.35s]  All right. Put your head down. Oh, come on. Oh, I did it. Cool. $8,600. Cool.
[23182.15s -> 23192.84s]  Okay. You win. No more eating brains for us. We just want to make music video with you now.
[23192.84s -> 23211.38s]  Sincerely, zombies. Cool. I should probably turn this up. I don't think I can though. Let's be quiet.
[23211.94s -> 23239.22s]  Two, three, dark and dead. We're going to bite all the petals off my head.
[23269.75s -> 23317.50s]  Flashing me. That might be the worst enemy in the game. They're probably the hardest to deal
[23317.50s -> 23369.99s]  with at least. Playing it now. The cat jams. Dancing. Cool. Hey, there it is. That was fun.
[23369.99s -> 23383.62s]  I do it real quickly when I just want to see the mini game stuff. Yeah, that was cute. It's been a
[23383.62s -> 23391.62s]  long time since I played it. It's actually been on the list for a while of just play this game.
[23391.62s -> 23397.54s]  And I'm sitting there going, Oh, how do I play Plants vs. How do I do that? But I think we just
[23397.54s -> 23416.81s]  do what we did tonight. It's just hang out, play a game. Can you do more late night streams?
[23419.86s -> 23432.70s]  You're going to see a lot more stuff like this this year. Very cool. Game of the Year content.
[23439.00s -> 23455.56s]  All right. Mini games, puzzles. What's a mini game? I'm curious. Oh, what? But if you guys like this,
[23455.56s -> 23462.02s]  I'm happy you did. Because I don't know, a lot of times when I'm thinking about what to do for a
[23462.02s -> 23466.46s]  stream or something, it's like, Oh, what's it going to be? It's going to be something fun or
[23466.46s -> 23474.42s]  funny or crazy or wacky or no, I don't think it has to be. I really don't think so. I think I'm
[23474.42s -> 23483.67s]  changing my philosophy on what it means to kind of stream the Twitch and stuff. And there's gonna
[23483.67s -> 23494.94s]  be more of this shit. It's fun. What about what's happening right now? But I need to actually get
[23494.94s -> 23530.82s]  free. So what if I don't get anything? Can I get anything? This is kind of, this is kind of
[23530.82s -> 23562.62s]  fucked up. I'm not going to lie. Okay. There we go. Dude, you suck at gambling. I'm trying as hard
[23562.62s -> 23569.91s]  as I can. Oh my God. It's late. I just realized it's like almost two o'clock in the morning Pacific.
[23569.91s -> 23590.30s]  What? I didn't know it was that late. It's still a lot of you here. Jesus. A lot of people probably
[23590.30s -> 23616.34s]  fell asleep. Oh, here we go again. Eastern time. Almost 5 a.m. Eastern. Late night crowd is usually
[23616.34s -> 23652.47s]  pretty chill from what I've seen. Is he afraid of us? No. I'm surprised I'm still doing fine here.
[23654.94s -> 23664.26s]  Do you still get up before noon? Yeah. I've been starting my day around like nine, nine thirty,
[23664.26s -> 23676.31s]  ten. The last probably a couple of years. At least last year. Uh oh. Uh oh. I, uh oh. All right.
[23676.31s -> 23716.50s]  What else I got? That's pretty cool. Um, classic walnut bowling. Jesus. Click on the right spot,
[23716.50s -> 23732.47s]  please. Okay. I got to leave. I was trying to click here. It's fine. I got enough.
[23733.19s -> 23758.04s]  I tried to do it again. See, look at, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look,
[23758.04s -> 23763.56s]  look at my fingers. Look, look, look, look at that. Look at my cursors. Look at that. See?
[23763.56s -> 23783.42s]  That's in the square down here. That's in that bottom square. This is actually really fun.
[23784.06s -> 23803.05s]  I can see why people like this game mode. That didn't hit.
[23817.40s -> 23845.40s]  Oh, shit. Get the cat. You have a lot of money. Uh oh.
[23861.72s -> 23862.52s]  I think this is where I lose.
[23873.96s -> 23882.46s]  Not quite. This is like a clean Dr. Mario or something. A Tetris. I hate this.
[23883.64s -> 23889.67s]  Oh, I don't hate this. I just hate that feeling. Oh, it's over.
[23916.71s -> 23919.69s]  Actually, as long as I get a bomb, I'll be fine.
[23937.72s -> 23939.80s]  Shit. I thought I could get out in time.
[23951.54s -> 23958.33s]  Okay. Is it RNG? I haven't seen a bomb in like, in at least two hours. Where are the bombs?
[23958.33s -> 23968.38s]  Where are the bombs? Yeah, there really hasn't been a bomb
[23968.38s -> 23972.38s]  at all. Look at all this junk here. How am I supposed to hit this? I need a bomb.
[23973.42s -> 24006.39s]  You have to save the... Ooh, presents. It's over. Well, maybe not. Hold on. Thanks for the bombs.
[24013.06s -> 24018.74s]  Finally. All right. This has to go right there. That didn't do anything. What? That hit two people.
[24020.74s -> 24030.09s]  That hit two people? There's 10 people standing here. What? Okay.
[24039.42s -> 24083.32s]  Yes, this is GG here. Yeah, that's still fun. Unless I get some insane luck right now. I think
[24083.32s -> 24091.02s]  I spammed them too much in the beginning. All right, that's cool. Looks like there's space for
[24091.02s -> 24101.58s]  way more of these. That's a lot. What is this? Oh yeah, I don't want to do this one. Yeah, no.
[24101.58s -> 24117.86s]  No, thank you. They attack back. No, that's too hard. Oh, I don't have enough. All right. I'm
[24117.86s -> 24129.18s]  going to call it here. Thanks for hanging out. We'll see you again. The next time I'm going to
[24129.18s -> 24138.09s]  stream, I planned on streaming on Thursday. We'll see. If not Thursday, then maybe because
[24138.09s -> 24144.98s]  Ster and I are going to do Saturday, Sunday with Elden Ring randomizer co-op again. So just keep an
[24144.98s -> 24150.18s]  eye on the sus. If you don't see anything in the next few days, the next two days, then expect
[24150.18s -> 24159.72s]  everything on Saturday, Sunday. But I might just show up and do what I did tonight. I was really
[24159.72s -> 24165.51s]  actually, if you want me to be real, I was kind of going, how are people going to react to this
[24165.51s -> 24172.66s]  stream? I didn't know if people were going to be like, you know, this is, I don't know, I don't
[24172.66s -> 24181.78s]  like this or something. So I'm glad that people seem to have a good time. So that's great. I'm
[24181.78s -> 24187.90s]  glad to see that because that means I'm going to do way more of them. Get hydrated. I've had,
[24187.90s -> 24198.68s]  I've been drinking tea. I had some water a little bit earlier too when I went downstairs. It was
[24199.48s -> 24220.06s]  good. Why do you, what are you so worried about? It would be terrible. It would be
[24220.06s -> 24227.98s]  terrible to have a random stream on Friday, my birthday. You didn't even type mustache. No,
[24227.98s -> 24243.66s]  I didn't. I really didn't. That's okay. Any news on Grotto Beast? I actually talked a lot about it
[24243.66s -> 24255.70s]  earlier at the beginning of the stream, the first hour or two. It gives them all mustaches. Yeah,
[24255.70s -> 24263.80s]  keep an eye on the sus. I'll see you this weekend, guaranteed. And then maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll
[24263.80s -> 24270.17s]  show up again before this weekend. If not, then expect Saturday, Sunday with a good old stir,
[24270.17s -> 24282.01s]  or Elden Ring. I think we're going to beat the game this weekend. I really do. But have a great
[24282.01s -> 24293.34s]  night. Have a, I mean, good morning probably for some of you at this point. I'll see you really
[24293.34s -> 24305.80s]  soon regardless. Get some sleep if you stayed up. I don't want to be the reason why you're
[24306.36s -> 24319.16s]  going to mess up your sleep schedule. Basically morning, yeah. I think it's morning for everybody
[24319.16s -> 24327.10s]  at this point. Too late. Should have said, yeah, I should have said that way earlier.
[24328.95s -> 24336.34s]  Hey, it's six o'clock in the morning. Hey, don't stay up for my sake. Bro, I'm on my like third,
[24336.34s -> 24354.71s]  I'm on my third Pepsi. And it's like 5.30. All right, good night, everybody. Drink some water.
[24354.71s -> 24361.96s]  Eat your vegetables. Call your mother. You know what to do. And I'll see you soon.
[24361.96s -> 24397.46s]  Keep an eye on the sus. Take care. See you again.
