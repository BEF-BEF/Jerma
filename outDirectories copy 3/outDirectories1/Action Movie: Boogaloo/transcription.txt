[133.82s -> 137.78s]  I don't know if you really can. You've like, okay, you didn't get in.

[148.06s -> 153.22s]  Action movie. You know, why did you not do the action movie?
[153.78s -> 156.94s]  I didn't want to get blown up. You threw a grenade in. Oh, hi.
[157.10s -> 161.74s]  All right. I want to get the action movie clip. Okay. Oh, he's getting away.
[162.10s -> 165.62s]  He's out of his mind. He's getting away. Action.
[168.82s -> 170.62s]  Okay. I want to get the action movie clip now.
[172.94s -> 177.49s]  Fuck off. It's a brawler.
[177.49s -> 180.65s]  It's rocking. I want to get the action movie clip. Get in there. Okay.
[180.65s -> 183.61s]  What is the action? What are we trying? I'm doing the action movie.

[193.09s -> 196.01s]  No, you can make it. It's supposed to be part of the movie.
[199.28s -> 203.40s]  Honey, I've got your favorite breakfast material here.
[204.45s -> 207.21s]  It's pop tarts. Oh, pop tarts.
[209.81s -> 220.90s]  I want them too. Ooh, that was stylish. I got, Oh, what's this?
[221.18s -> 226.34s]  Slow motion. I better hide from you.
[227.54s -> 231.26s]  He's coming after you. He's really is. Why did he spawn right here?
[233.51s -> 234.35s]  Cause this is where.
[234.35s -> 241.82s]  No, these corners right here is like the majority of the spawns.
[246.30s -> 248.34s]  We're just all spawning on top of each other.
[249.70s -> 252.38s]  You think you're going to be able to mess with the walker?
[253.14s -> 256.70s]  You're not a walker. You have to be certified to be a walker.
[256.78s -> 262.54s]  You can fuck with the walker. Dead. Where are you hiding?
[262.86s -> 265.62s]  It's not hiding. I'm running around doing the checkpoints.
[267.69s -> 271.65s]  That's not very stylish of you to do. Oh, good grenade. Good night woman.
[271.89s -> 275.21s]  That wasn't even close to that. I seriously was not even close to that.
[276.05s -> 278.37s]  No, when you see that, you're going to see that. You're going to be like,
[278.41s -> 281.45s]  wow, I can't believe that actually. Oh, wow. That's interesting.
[285.39s -> 286.91s]  Yeah. Go fuck yourself.
[291.68s -> 294.16s]  I can only imagine that I must've looked like a rocket.
[296.16s -> 298.48s]  You really were like jet propelled in my face.
[299.78s -> 302.70s]  Uh, the noise you made too.
[305.02s -> 309.59s]  Is this thing reloaded?
[316.94s -> 318.66s]  How could I not have hit you by now?
[321.54s -> 323.98s]  Did I get you in the head? Probably.
[325.22s -> 329.90s]  Where is this guy? He's up there. No, that's you again.
[331.78s -> 336.82s]  I'm not going to mess around this time. Who's slow mode?
[337.78s -> 340.10s]  Him. He came in behind us. Can I slow mo his slow mo?
[340.54s -> 343.62s]  You can slow mo his slow mo if you slow mo. We're stuck in slow mo.
[344.02s -> 348.04s]  Shit. Just come meet me at the secret hole.
[348.48s -> 350.16s]  I'm coming to meet you at the secret hole.
[350.16s -> 352.24s]  I'm down near the secret hole in the secret,
[352.60s -> 356.60s]  in the secrets of the lost temple of doom. Hey, what's up? That wasn't even you.
[357.64s -> 358.96s]  That wasn't even you. And I, I, I'm,
[362.32s -> 365.68s]  I waited for him to do that. Are you serious? Yeah.
[366.08s -> 367.76s]  I just watched him coming down the hallway.
[367.96s -> 369.92s]  I probably scared the shit out of that guy though.
[371.06s -> 373.98s]  Cause I think he knows we are both secret hole and cause he kind of saw me go
[373.98s -> 375.54s]  down there. Does he know about the secret hole?
[375.58s -> 377.46s]  Well, he doesn't know about the fact that I'm behind. Oh,
[377.46s -> 380.78s]  he jumped at the same exact time. He still doesn't know I'm behind him.
[381.72s -> 387.60s]  He doesn't know anything about the secret hole. Come look for me.
[388.12s -> 390.00s]  Come look for me in the secret hole.
[390.96s -> 394.04s]  Oh, he came and looked for me and it was perfect cause he has slow motion.
[394.60s -> 399.59s]  Grenade. You're just throwing grenades down the hole. Yeah.
[400.11s -> 405.17s]  You are a fucking dick. Secret hole.
[405.57s -> 410.66s]  Meet me maybe in the secret hole and you have to come down.
[410.90s -> 412.70s]  You have to come down the actual secret hole.
[412.70s -> 416.86s]  You can't like do like the sneaky secret hole part seriously.
[416.86s -> 418.46s]  Why would I think you were going to do anything else?
[418.90s -> 420.74s]  Why would I ever think you were going to do anything else?
