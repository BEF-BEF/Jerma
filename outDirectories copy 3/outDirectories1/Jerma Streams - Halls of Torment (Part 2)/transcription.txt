[21.75s -> 25.67s]  Hey, what's up? Yeah, I know I'm late. Yeah, it's meh, well, not really.
[26.47s -> 36.97s]  Not really. Well, I was going to stream yesterday, but moved it to today.
[38.02s -> 45.22s]  It was going to be six o'clock at night, but reverse delayed after a delay to noon.
[45.22s -> 56.55s]  So you got both a delay and a reverse delay. My favorite econ. I appreciate that.
[56.55s -> 66.01s]  We should all play Valorant so I play it. A lot of people already play Valorant and I don't play it.
[70.41s -> 74.09s]  I'm definitely not going to play Valorant. I'm telling you right now.
[77.05s -> 86.90s]  Any shooter game that requires a ton of brain power to learn. Is Valorant a high brain power game?
[86.90s -> 89.54s]  Or no, people are going to laugh at me for saying that, aren't they?
[90.42s -> 99.18s]  Am I going to get laughed at for saying that? No? I mean, it feels like kind of a high brain
[99.18s -> 108.66s]  power game. You played TF2. I just told you a story a few days ago about how
[108.66s -> 112.18s]  I AFKed and spawned with the flog and ate chocolate until I fell asleep.
[114.50s -> 121.05s]  I don't think you can do that in Valorant. So I'm not so sure as some of these
[121.05s -> 129.94s]  some of these shooter games are for me. But anyways, hello. We're going to play more
[129.94s -> 135.53s]  Halls of Torment today. It's going to be a very short stream. I have to prepare.
[136.25s -> 144.89s]  A stir is coming to Vegas. So I'm going to spend some time. It could be really interesting. It's
[144.89s -> 153.61s]  been a while since being stirred. Spent some time hanging out. How short? Probably like two
[153.61s -> 160.89s]  or three hours. That's very short. But hey, let's hang out. I also plan on opening some crates
[160.89s -> 166.06s]  in Team Fortress today. I have a whole backpack full of keys and shit. I'm just like, do I? How
[166.06s -> 171.10s]  do I? What do I even do about this? So you're going to get a Halls of Torment, one or two
[171.10s -> 180.97s]  Halls of Torment runs, and then a TF2 box opening stream. Welcome. Welcome to the new Jerma.
[182.12s -> 189.40s]  Oh, boy. He's going to just open crates for an hour and leave. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, this is this is
[189.40s -> 200.25s]  the end. This is the we're at the end. No, no, it's I just I have a lot of cases that are old.
[200.97s -> 208.65s]  I've got like winter, like 2020, like 2019, I think crates. I don't even know what's in them.
[209.29s -> 220.71s]  I've got, I don't know. I got 25 keys. When are you going to play viewfinder? Yeah. Winter cases,
[220.71s -> 228.39s]  omega low. Don't open. Are they bad? Should I not have gotten the winter cases? Well, I didn't get
[228.39s -> 235.69s]  any. I just have had them for like half a decade. The winter cases are dog shit. What? That's like
[235.69s -> 241.62s]  half the inventory, I think. Is that how I think that would be? Oh, well, you're okay. Well,
[241.62s -> 247.51s]  you're not even going to want to watch that part. The most expensive item you can get is five cents.
[248.23s -> 263.06s]  What on the marketplace? Oh, whatever. I got 25 keys. Okay, Tony Montana. I have guys I haven't
[263.06s -> 275.00s]  opened a TF2 box. As of like the last seven days. It's been almost. It's been like seven or eight
[275.00s -> 283.90s]  years. It's been a very long time. It's just I have a lot of these boxes in my inventory. I did
[283.90s -> 290.22s]  a full inventory cleanup. And you know what happens when you do an inventory cleanup in Team Fortress?
[291.66s -> 300.68s]  You. Well, this is what I do. Each backpack slot is another class slot. So one is scout,
[300.68s -> 306.84s]  two is soldier, backpack slot, three is pyro, right? I like to keep it very organized. And when
[306.92s -> 312.44s]  I did that, I realized I had like 80 crates. I'm just like, what do I do with all these?
[312.44s -> 317.08s]  And then I was told, don't open all these ones because they're terrible. But I got war paint
[317.08s -> 321.24s]  cases. I've got cosmetic cases from the last five years. I don't know. I'll just open them.
[321.96s -> 326.58s]  Sort by type. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm terrified to click that button because there's
[326.58s -> 331.77s]  no undo. All right. Okay. Stop stalling. I'm going to be for like two, three hours. So no stalling,
[331.77s -> 337.43s]  no stalling. Yeah, no stalling. Let's go and play halls of torment for a little bit. And then we'll
[337.43s -> 343.75s]  play some TF2. Open it up some cases and crates. Play the game. I know, I know, I got to go. I know
[343.75s -> 353.21s]  I have to do it. I like this game. All right. So we left up halls of torment a few days ago.
[353.21s -> 362.28s]  Give me all the loot for safekeeping. Wink, wink. It's kind of funny because I've, I know, go,
[362.28s -> 370.58s]  dude, go. You only got two hours. Go. But let me tell you a story. Hold on. Let me just get,
[370.58s -> 379.99s]  I've got 3000 gold. Yeah. All right. I want to refund all because I'm playing the burn character.
[379.99s -> 385.91s]  So we're gonna do some crazy shit with the burn character. Start talking about Diablo four.
[386.55s -> 395.08s]  I should give you guys my takes more often because I saw a few comments of people saying like,
[395.08s -> 398.68s]  oh man, like this is like one of the only things he's ever said that I like agree with.
[398.68s -> 404.41s]  Should I give you my takes more often instead of just, okay, the only takes you guys get from me
[405.21s -> 412.55s]  are like dog food flavors. And I'm just like fucking around, right? But like you never get
[412.55s -> 416.55s]  like a real take from me. So you can never get my real opinions on anything. So the only opinion
[416.55s -> 422.68s]  you do get from me are dog food. So that's why all of you think I'm, I'm like a psycho
[422.68s -> 427.83s]  because I never give you a real take. And the comedy takes I give are about eating dog food.
[427.83s -> 436.73s]  So I get it. I completely understand that now. All right. So this, this is the fire character.
[436.73s -> 454.68s]  He's so fake. I'm maxing this out. What do you think? Projectile size and attack speed.
[454.68s -> 473.02s]  I think that's fine. Dog food takes. Revives are pretty big too. Say something controversial,
[473.02s -> 483.94s]  please. Um, no, I don't. What should I put the last one in damage, damage and defense?
[483.94s -> 497.86s]  What are your thoughts on the new Airbus? Like the new airplane? I don't know. Uh,
[497.86s -> 503.13s]  I'm actually going to take away regen and get movement speed with this character.
[503.13s -> 508.60s]  All right, cool. What do we have for items? Oh my God. He hates the Airbus.
[508.60s -> 519.50s]  What's so new about it? What does it, what does it do? You need to go on a rant, dude. Hey,
[519.50s -> 529.24s]  go on a rant. No, you don't want a rant. Like you don't want a bunch of takes from me. Trust me.
[529.32s -> 538.76s]  But back when Diablo two came out, what's a good item? I should dig. You don't know. You don't.
[538.76s -> 548.46s]  You really don't. I'm telling you. Three of you are going to go based and 10,000 of you are going
[548.46s -> 565.53s]  to go, what is it? What? Shut up. That's a good one. That's huge too. So this is 40% crit damage
[565.53s -> 573.91s]  and 10% base crit chance. That's cool. I remember getting those. Uh, we're going with this. I'm ready
[573.91s -> 583.05s]  to play one of my new favorites from 2023. I think I'm strong enough to try. Should I try to actually
[583.05s -> 592.18s]  beat the boss? You have an NA education? Yes, I do. What do you want to say? Yes. You want to deny
[592.18s -> 597.83s]  that? No, I don't. Shut up idiot. No, I don't. Yeah, I do. Yeah. I, I, I have a North American
[597.83s -> 610.02s]  education. Does that make you angry with me? All right. So I have auto attack on which holy
[610.02s -> 617.93s]  shit I am. I'm way stronger than I used to be. Okay. This is going great. We're going to do attack
[617.93s -> 636.01s]  speed. What was this doing before? Like 20 already leveled up twice. It's always damaged. WM one
[636.01s -> 645.98s]  gameplay. Yeah. Well, this is my favorite. It's probably my favorite character so far.
[645.98s -> 649.98s]  Is it always movement speed or should I finally do pick up range and have the people that were
[649.98s -> 656.62s]  very mad at me last time that I didn't pick it up, pick it up? Time is moving too fast.
[656.62s -> 663.48s]  It's so fucked up that it's August of 2023. Why is it? What happened to 2020? Well, I think I can
[663.48s -> 671.99s]  explain what you're feeling. Uh, COVID deleted two years that COVID essentially just absolutely
[671.99s -> 679.22s]  liquidated two full years. That's why it feels like 2021 because 2020 and 2021 and some of 2022
[679.22s -> 692.78s]  barely even happened. So yeah, we time traveled from 2020 to 2023 in a lot of ways. Um, I don't
[692.78s -> 698.09s]  know what to do here. I'm doing pick up range. I know that is not great, but if somebody put
[698.09s -> 713.26s]  their hand through their monitor, but sorry, we should make a petition to petition to go revert
[713.26s -> 722.60s]  back to 2021. That's kind of interesting. That's weird. Ladies and gentlemen, we have decided in
[722.60s -> 730.60s]  Congress, we are going to be introducing the rewind time act, uh, myself and Senator Stevenson
[730.60s -> 736.20s]  over there thought it was a good idea to rewind time back to 2021 because COVID fucked up everything
[736.20s -> 761.29s]  for two years. You've already used two rewinds. We made up time anyways. Isn't there like a wild
[761.29s -> 767.64s]  theory that we're in the wrong year? I heard that somewhere that it's actually like,
[767.64s -> 773.67s]  it's not 2000. It's not like 2000. We're living in like the, like the 1400s or something,
[773.67s -> 778.81s]  right? Isn't that what I heard? Isn't that what you heard? I heard that. Did you hear that? Bro,
[778.81s -> 791.48s]  you talked about this already. No, I didn't. I heard that we very, we could be like way further
[791.48s -> 800.09s]  in the future or way earlier. You heard that theory? I probably heard this theory on a fucking
[800.09s -> 809.67s]  YouTube short that I scrolled by every time I opened up YouTube shorts. I just got to tell you,
[810.71s -> 817.06s]  I, I think I'm getting older. I'm getting a lot older. I can definitely feel myself growing up,
[817.06s -> 826.87s]  but I scroll through YouTube shorts and I just go, what is going on? What is happening? I'm like,
[826.87s -> 836.89s]  am I older? I'm too old now. I'm, I'm too old for this. What's happening? That's a cool theory.
[836.89s -> 852.97s]  I'm 22 and I feel that way. Go to the blood trail. I want to get strong first. Hold on. Dude,
[852.97s -> 861.19s]  you're crazy. I don't, I don't know. I don't think so. I will scroll through YouTube shorts
[863.06s -> 871.14s]  and I just kind of, I, after like 10, I just stop and then I go back up three. Cause I go,
[871.14s -> 874.66s]  there's no fucking way. That's what I just watched like a minute and a half ago. Is it?
[874.66s -> 885.32s]  And I give that person like five more views in a row. You know what I mean? It's just like,
[885.32s -> 889.24s]  no, there's no way that what I just watched was what I just watched. Oh, it was, was it?
[890.04s -> 904.84s]  If you don't understand skibbidi toilet, you're fine. I've seen it. I've seen it. I watched it.
[904.84s -> 915.70s]  I don't think I saw the whole thing. These are all good. That's the one where the people with the
[915.70s -> 918.66s]  cameras for faces are like punching the people with the toilets, right? And it's,
[918.66s -> 929.48s]  they're like in a gigantic, there's like a big fight. Who told him? What do you mean who told
[929.48s -> 940.30s]  him? I saw it. And I was just like, oh, what the fuck is happening in this? Okay. Let me,
[940.30s -> 948.49s]  let me pay attention. He's becoming too advanced. I want the burn chance and no,
[948.49s -> 953.26s]  I'm not going to be playing this optimally. I know this is a good game for me to hang out
[953.26s -> 957.98s]  and just talk and chill, which is I like doing that. It's fun. So if I pick the wrong thing,
[959.10s -> 967.38s]  I'm just hanging out. We're just chilling. Don't worry. Zoomer humor. Enjoy your Andy.
[967.94s -> 977.16s]  I've made this statement before and it's very, very real. Oh yeah. Zoomer humor is,
[978.63s -> 985.72s]  is very, it's over very quickly. I brought up this very important point.
[985.72s -> 991.35s]  When you talk about zoomer humor, I can decide if I liked something in literally eight seconds.
[991.35s -> 995.51s]  Boomer humor, I might have to sit there for 30 minutes while they explain like a whole thing
[995.51s -> 1001.83s]  and then tell it to me, like at the end of that. So it's like the one good thing for me about zoomer
[1001.83s -> 1010.10s]  humor is it's either good or it's not very quickly. So, but I do love that Boomer humor style where
[1010.10s -> 1014.50s]  you kind of have to tell a whole elaborate story, but one thing that might be kind of funny in the
[1014.50s -> 1027.53s]  middle. I very much enjoy the Boomer humor style, but zoomer humor is quick. It's to the point
[1027.53s -> 1039.83s]  and it gets going very quickly. I want health defense or let's do region. There's no setup.
[1039.83s -> 1044.15s]  Yeah. I like a big setup. I think that's pretty obvious if any of you have been here for long
[1044.15s -> 1052.66s]  enough. Honestly, the setup to me is a lot of times more fun than actually telling the joke
[1052.66s -> 1067.96s]  and sometimes way more fun. If you don't like to do Airbus, do you prefer the 747, the 787?
[1070.87s -> 1084.81s]  I don't prefer, and I don't, I don't, sure. I don't have like an airplane preference.
[1085.53s -> 1090.42s]  Although I guess maybe the newer ones are just, they're outfitted better with
[1090.42s -> 1101.74s]  more amenities. I guess, I don't know. What do you mean what? I said the newer ones are outfitted
[1101.74s -> 1111.02s]  with more amenities. Is that, but wait, is it, you literally flew a plane. Definitely this. Wait,
[1111.02s -> 1126.97s]  probably the dragon's breath carried that entire time I got close. You did? No, I did. Me and Austin
[1126.97s -> 1138.30s]  show. I was on his flight show. That was really cool. That was a great time. How come you hate
[1138.30s -> 1150.44s]  the council of sorcery so much? I don't. Do you have a private jet? I feel like if I flew in a
[1150.44s -> 1157.99s]  private jet one time, it would be over. I would like probably wipe out my entire bank account,
[1157.99s -> 1175.26s]  everything. I don't think that's a good idea. That's probably a really bad idea. I don't even
[1175.26s -> 1181.70s]  know how much even is. Okay. If I were to take a private jet, a private plane, how much does it
[1181.70s -> 1205.18s]  even cost? I don't even, I don't even know. It's $10,000 minimum. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I don't
[1205.18s -> 1226.01s]  think so. I don't think so. Not worth it. No, I don't, for me, I mean, I hate flying. I don't
[1226.01s -> 1233.48s]  like airplanes. I'm not afraid of flying. It's just the whole travel experience to me. It's like the
[1233.48s -> 1238.76s]  having to go through into the terminal and go through the security area and wait for everybody
[1238.76s -> 1243.88s]  to get on the plane and get on the plane and then sit there. And then it takes, it takes like three
[1243.88s -> 1251.58s]  hours to get on an airplane. Sometimes I hate it. I don't hate being in the air. I just, I just don't
[1251.58s -> 1256.81s]  like the whole prospect of the amount of time and how annoying it is to actually get into the plane
[1256.89s -> 1275.37s]  in the first place. Ooh. But is that worth like 9,000 extra dollars? Because even a first class
[1275.37s -> 1283.54s]  ticket on some of these airlines, that's already a huge premium on that seat. I don't think I would
[1283.54s -> 1288.18s]  want to pay like a thousand percent premium to get on like a private, I don't know. No,
[1289.46s -> 1299.46s]  no, you could afford it. I think a lot of you guys may be overestimating my finances a little.
[1300.02s -> 1307.02s]  Dude, bro, you can do it, dude. Just take a private plane everywhere you fucking go. It's only like
[1307.02s -> 1313.50s]  20 grand a flight. You got the money, you'll be fine. It's like, I think you guys may be
[1313.50s -> 1331.45s]  overestimating my financial ability to fly on a private plane all the time. What is it? I already
[1331.45s -> 1345.45s]  own all of these. You rented a baseball field. Yeah, that was for, that was for a stream that a
[1345.45s -> 1352.09s]  lot of time and a lot of energy went into. Me renting a baseball field out versus getting on
[1352.09s -> 1358.76s]  a private plane? That's, those are two very different things. Those are not even close.
[1364.52s -> 1369.77s]  I guess I'm just going to take it because I can deposit it because I don't have it yet, right?
[1369.77s -> 1379.96s]  This is physical attacks though. Do a private jet stream. No, no, I don't want to do that. No,
[1379.96s -> 1394.65s]  thank you. That whole stream is what? Just me flying on an airplane and reading a newspaper
[1399.06s -> 1406.66s]  and grabbing the sprite out of the flight attendant's hand. Just being like, thank you.
[1406.66s -> 1418.28s]  Thank you. That's it. That's the whole, that's all the content. Thank you. Thank you. And then
[1418.28s -> 1427.83s]  maybe like an hour goes by and I'm like, excuse me. Do you guys have headphones? Thank you.
[1428.47s -> 1454.70s]  Regen. No, multi hit. Didn't bring your own headphones. Headphones is always, I just,
[1454.70s -> 1462.90s]  I don't really do. Okay. A lot of you here, headphones might be a very important accessory
[1462.90s -> 1468.25s]  you take everywhere. I do not. Headphones to me are something that has to be packed.
[1469.38s -> 1476.02s]  I never carry them. They're never on me. It's never, I don't really. Oh, I've got my earbuds
[1476.02s -> 1485.19s]  in or whatever. Not really. So headphones to me are not an object I carry on me frequently.
[1493.37s -> 1506.17s]  You need to go down. Yep. Yep. We're just talking. All right. I'm going up. I don't want to deposit
[1506.17s -> 1524.20s]  this to the well yet because I might get a better item. Do you just sit and stare at a wall during
[1524.20s -> 1536.33s]  a plane ride? I mean, no, I'll, I'll do stuff on like tablets and stuff. Or sometimes, you know,
[1536.33s -> 1547.98s]  you get TV in front of you. Sometimes that's, that's fun. I'll load up. You know, it's great
[1547.98s -> 1554.54s]  on an airplane. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it. Is it what? Here's the
[1554.54s -> 1558.62s]  strat. You ready for the, are you ready for the strategy? If your plane ride is more than three
[1558.62s -> 1566.33s]  hours long or about two to three hours long, go play the curb your enthusiasm roulette. You go pick
[1566.33s -> 1571.18s]  three random curb or four random curb your enthusiasm episodes. It doesn't matter what
[1571.18s -> 1576.78s]  they are. Just pick them out randomly. Cause even if you've seen it already, it's still going to be
[1576.78s -> 1589.88s]  good. That's the strategy for every airplane from any season. Doesn't matter what it is.
[1589.88s -> 1595.08s]  That's a boomer show. I want that person actually timed up that, that, that was what you just said
[1595.08s -> 1612.73s]  was offensive to me. Time them up for two minutes, at least a minute. I'm going to pick up range Andy
[1612.73s -> 1628.65s]  right now while I'm still doing pretty good damage. They got timed out. I'm saying Andy,
[1628.65s -> 1637.00s]  we don't even say it here. I do. What do you mean? I, I'm saying it right now. I say it all. What
[1637.00s -> 1641.56s]  do you mean we don't say it here? I say it every stream, like a hundred times the stream.
[1642.52s -> 1657.80s]  Maybe you don't, but I do. Did you, I've read that wrong. Oh, did I read that wrong?
[1658.84s -> 1669.30s]  What'd you say? You're overusing, you're overusing it. We love Andy here. We love saying Andy.
[1669.94s -> 1682.12s]  It's just such a quick way to get a point across about anything. It just really is. Like I told
[1682.12s -> 1687.40s]  you, zoomer. Well, that's, I don't think Andy is zoomer. That's more millennial, but like millennial
[1687.40s -> 1694.66s]  versus boomer, like me sitting here and explaining this, what you're seeing on the screen, this
[1694.66s -> 1703.35s]  character. Well, this character, I'll tell you at some point throughout the last hundred years or so,
[1703.35s -> 1711.11s]  fire became a device that was able to be used coming out of a propulsion machine that has oil
[1711.11s -> 1717.59s]  and a propulsion mechanism with an emulsifier in it. And what that does is that allows the fire to
[1717.59s -> 1723.03s]  go forward and be able to do what you're doing, wiping out all those monsters that I see. And it's
[1723.03s -> 1732.28s]  pretty wonderful invention versus flamethrower Andy. I can get my point across very quickly.
[1732.28s -> 1755.06s]  Oh, yes. You just lost a hundred viewers. It's all right there. They're going to be back or they're
[1755.06s -> 1760.97s]  not. Don't worry. Don't worry about how many people are here or not. They're going to come back or
[1760.97s -> 1782.78s]  they're not. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm at work. Say hi. Am I on a work TV?
[1794.66s -> 1804.54s]  Yes, man. I'll tell you that the finance department is doing such an unbelievable job.
[1805.18s -> 1812.81s]  If you can hear this right now, a lot of the departments that are working for this company
[1812.81s -> 1817.54s]  are doing fantastic. So a great experience I've had working with them. I've never worked with them,
[1817.54s -> 1820.58s]  by the way, just for complete transparency sake. I've never worked with anybody here. I don't know
[1820.58s -> 1825.38s]  what this job is and I don't condone or support anything that anybody's doing in this. It's proven
[1825.38s -> 1828.58s]  to what that could be otherwise. So that was a joke and I have no idea what you do and I have no
[1828.58s -> 1859.06s]  idea what's going on in this business. It's too late. Centrist Andy. I don't know what the fuck
[1859.06s -> 1869.32s]  I'm talking about. That person could have just made that up just like I did. Verify your information
[1869.32s -> 1884.92s]  everybody before you make any, make sure you verify info. I love how that turned. I love
[1884.92s -> 1912.47s]  how that dumb joke just turned into verify info. Okay, you turned it into a PSA. Yeah, I did. Can
[1912.47s -> 1926.95s]  you please do your Adam Sandler bee sting on tongue impression? Is that close? I think that's
[1926.95s -> 1942.73s]  what you meant. Is that what you meant? I feel like that's what you meant. What happened to night time
[1942.81s -> 1950.63s]  streams? Well, the reason why I'm streams are early is because stir is coming into Vegas.
[1951.75s -> 1964.65s]  So I want to get prepared for stir. I'll be hanging out with stir. You're going to do an
[1964.65s -> 1986.78s]  IRL stream. No, something new. Oh shit. One of these is good. What do you mean prepare? I don't know.
[1987.58s -> 1995.10s]  When you have a friend coming into town, you want to make sure that like things look a little cleaner.
[1995.10s -> 2000.50s]  Things look better. It's not like a, I don't know. I want to make sure I got like an itinerary to
[2001.30s -> 2008.02s]  fun stuff to do. What are you talking about? You don't prepare for an arrival for someone
[2008.02s -> 2022.81s]  if they're coming in that week. What are you talking about? I think it's these. Are you guys
[2022.81s -> 2035.72s]  going to watch Barbie? I don't think so. What are the specs of your PC? I don't even know.
[2036.28s -> 2043.98s]  It's been a long time. I think I have a command. Isn't there a command to tell you guys what's in
[2043.98s -> 2056.63s]  my computer that I used to have one of those? Oh, there it is. Okay. Let me tell you. I have
[2056.63s -> 2068.49s]  eight 64 P. That's not right. Did it pop up? I'm so I'm still pissed off that you called me ball
[2068.49s -> 2073.77s]  fondler instead of bomb fondler during the day of the diver. Oh, that's your okay. Well, but you're
[2073.77s -> 2077.85s]  still in the ball fondler category though, because there's three X's before your name and you have
[2077.85s -> 2081.93s]  ball after the three X's. Come on. You got to give me a little bit of credit. The chat goes by fast
[2081.93s -> 2092.90s]  a lot sometimes. Yeah, I've got a 3090 and a I don't even know. Is it AMD or Intel in here?
[2092.90s -> 2105.35s]  AMD 5600 X. I got 64 gigabytes of RAM. I know that these ones are probably better, but I'm going to
[2105.35s -> 2109.10s]  take these and I'm going to deposit this because I think it's fun. And that's what I'm playing this
[2109.10s -> 2123.37s]  game for. Now I'm going to deposit that when I come back up, try wear it 10 crit or I don't
[2123.37s -> 2128.06s]  think you can compete with 10% base crit, but it's crit damage better than having skeletons
[2128.06s -> 2156.33s]  run around. Probably not. Are you going to shave before stirr is here? Stirr prefer bowing or air
[2156.33s -> 2184.70s]  bus. I don't know. Please choose range for the love of God. This is just a warm up round. And
[2184.70s -> 2191.24s]  plus we're just talking. I'm just hanging out. I'm not trying to optimally play the video game. I'm
[2191.24s -> 2204.60s]  trying to survive long enough to talk over it. That's kind of funny, but look, look at how much
[2204.60s -> 2221.67s]  better this is than range. I'm getting a lot of items. Okay. I feel like phantom needles is good
[2221.67s -> 2238.76s]  here. This is just now. Transfection is amazing. Just does so much damage. What is stirr's
[2238.76s -> 2267.29s]  astrological sign? Um, I don't know. He's a night elf. I don't know. Hmm. Range. Take the range.
[2267.29s -> 2286.30s]  All right. Now I gotta go up here. I gotta start doing some survivability here. I'm going to
[2286.30s -> 2298.63s]  deposit the skeleton ring. That's a good idea. This 10% fragile chance. What is fragile? Let's
[2298.63s -> 2309.62s]  see. Breach stack. Affliction increases the damage taken from damage over time. Well,
[2309.62s -> 2314.79s]  that's amazing. Modifies the chance to apply effects on enemies for every a hundred percent
[2314.79s -> 2334.65s]  chance. One stack is guaranteed. Hey, Jerma, let's go. What are we, where, what are we going?
[2335.29s -> 2352.22s]  What are we going? I want to be, I might, there's an opportunity to beat the actual boss here.
[2352.94s -> 2394.95s]  All right. I got to stop going down. I gotta go up. Great chance. All the blood stains, bro. Am I
[2394.95s -> 2400.90s]  ready for the blood stain yet? Should I get a little bit stronger? Am I ready to do it? Because
[2400.90s -> 2404.78s]  I'm imagining that's going to summon like a hard boss or something. I don't think I'm ready for it.
[2411.78s -> 2419.43s]  Watching you play this makes me want to eat my own hands. Uh, I could probably think of a few other
[2419.43s -> 2443.93s]  things you could be doing if you really wanted to not do that. This one. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not very
[2443.93s -> 2449.29s]  locked in right now. I'm, I'm looking over at the chat reading. This is, this is more like a podcast
[2449.29s -> 2477.99s]  stream. Ooh, it's a lot of area. Okay. I, what am I getting hit by? Lightning. Let me at least
[2477.99s -> 2497.05s]  deposit this. I mean, there's just, I can't take anything else. All right. Last pass. I'll get the
[2497.05s -> 2512.79s]  last pass here. All right. Now I'm going up. I'm going to go get the magnet too. We have a return
[2512.79s -> 2518.52s]  to the Sims. Yeah, definitely. Sims is a great game just to open up and just play it whenever,
[2519.16s -> 2528.31s]  even if there's no mods on it, it's just fun to start a new person. So yeah, it's kind of a staple,
[2528.31s -> 2542.74s]  isn't it? The Sims is always fun no matter what, but I never want to overdo it though.
[2543.30s -> 2547.93s]  I feel like the Sims is one of those things where it's really fun for like a week and then you kind
[2547.93s -> 2553.67s]  of let it go for six months, come back and it's a whole new, fresh, fun experience again. You can
[2553.67s -> 2567.22s]  kind of do that over and over again. You'd like Project Zomboid. I thought about playing Project
[2567.22s -> 2588.10s]  Zomboid. I want to, there's a lot of games to play and there's, I have lots of, I have lots of
[2588.10s -> 2595.61s]  potential streaming stuff to do. And it works out a lot, especially for somebody, I mean as a, you
[2595.61s -> 2601.13s]  know, the stream reduction that a lot of you guys have been used to this. Well, not even reduction,
[2601.13s -> 2621.00s]  but hold on, I don't want to die. You can play Borderlands 2? Probably not. Zomboid is boring
[2621.00s -> 2629.43s]  and overrated. I think I just never played it because it reminded me almost of looking at Path
[2629.43s -> 2636.17s]  of Exile the first time. Where it's just like, this is, look, this seems very, this seems like
[2636.17s -> 2641.10s]  a lot going on here that I don't know if I want to give the time to learn about it. Is that correct?
[2649.37s -> 2660.60s]  Kind of? No, actually, yeah. All right. That, that one guy saying pick range, I hope they're happy
[2660.60s -> 2687.82s]  because I've picked it like eight times in a row. Definitely this. Let's deposit this so I can do
[2687.82s -> 2700.60s]  Skeleton Friends eventually. It's a hard learning curve, but it's really fun. It does look very fun,
[2701.16s -> 2711.22s]  I will say. Max out Dragon Breath as fast as possible because it's the best ability in the
[2711.22s -> 2743.43s]  game from what I've seen. Ouch. Jeez. What is hitting me? Hurry up. Die. Okay. Firewalker boots
[2743.43s -> 2751.46s]  or I can't really take these anyways. Do I, am I missing anything? No. This is cool for this
[2751.46s -> 2763.90s]  character, but these really don't seem like they're that good. I mean, I'm the fire character, but
[2763.90s -> 2772.49s]  the fire doesn't seem that great. 15% movement speed seems just good no matter what. The boots
[2772.49s -> 2784.57s]  are amazing for bosses though. You use them, they suck. I use them with the not fire character and
[2784.57s -> 2792.76s]  I feel like I have a lot of burn and a lot of bonuses to fire right now. You should try Baldur's Gate.
[2792.76s -> 2797.67s]  I've heard a lot about Baldur's Gate and I'm kind of afraid to put any time into it because I feel
[2797.67s -> 2800.71s]  like it's one of those games where you need to know an entire encyclopedia before you start
[2800.71s -> 2818.15s]  playing it. Is that true? Not true. I think any, because Baldur's Gate is a D&D kind of, based on
[2818.15s -> 2824.86s]  D&D, right? All I remember was hearing about, oh this game is like kind of built on top of D&D,
[2824.86s -> 2830.94s]  it's like a D&D game. Oh cool, it was Neverwinter. And I remember being like, whoa, I mean I can like
[2830.94s -> 2839.74s]  play this as a ton of like characters and classes. And I remember playing this character just, I was
[2839.74s -> 2845.16s]  so disappointed in the game because I was playing it wrong. And I remember just like playing it and
[2845.16s -> 2850.82s]  the character I made, the only move that the character had was they went like, they did like
[2850.82s -> 2855.38s]  a whistle or like a sing and that was it. That's the only move I did. And I was like, this is,
[2855.38s -> 2864.92s]  I don't, I'm not having any fun. I like one move. I was like, why do I, I don't, I don't, I'm playing
[2864.92s -> 2882.87s]  this so wrong, aren't I? I think I was playing like a musical character, like a bard or something.
[2882.87s -> 2891.46s]  That was a pepino? God damn it, it was. I'll take them.
[2894.89s -> 2905.77s]  Is it weird that sometimes I just go to YouTube and type in a pepino scream and just listen to it
[2905.77s -> 2918.01s]  like 10 times in a row and then go on with my day? Is that weird? I do this not that often,
[2919.29s -> 2945.26s]  maybe once every couple months. What about Mortal Kombat 1? Yeah, I'll play it. I'll play
[2945.26s -> 2952.87s]  Mortal Kombat 1. You guys can all queue up and just absolutely shit on me. We'll make a fun
[2952.87s -> 2973.58s]  night out of it. More area, yes. I gotta start looking for health because I'm almost at the
[2973.58s -> 2985.69s]  30 minutes. I beat the boss last time, right? Yeah, I did. I got to the end with the other
[2985.69s -> 3000.74s]  character. Do the blood trail? No, I'm afraid. I'm scared of it. Why did that person just write
[3000.82s -> 3021.42s]  stimulus? Why did you do that? WM1, Andy? Yeah. You know what else is really funny too about
[3021.42s -> 3027.80s]  getting a little older? Kind of starting to feel myself grow up a lot. Back when I first played
[3027.80s -> 3034.09s]  Team Fortress 2, I remember. I remember being like, oh, WM1, come on. You could do better than that.
[3037.03s -> 3044.63s]  You suck at this game. What's with this? You're on pyro, of course. This pyro sucks. Now I'm just
[3044.63s -> 3049.83s]  like, oh man, I like this class a lot. This vlog class, I just can walk forward for a second.
[3050.55s -> 3065.22s]  It's funny. Everybody talks shit about pyro until they play pyro and then they're quiet,
[3066.74s -> 3071.53s]  right? You even notice that? Sit there, you get killed by a pyro and it's like,
[3071.53s -> 3074.73s]  you fucking idiot. What do you fucking even know about this game? What do you even know about
[3074.73s -> 3082.50s]  aiming? And then you pick pyro and you just kind of silently play it and you're like, wow,
[3082.50s -> 3088.73s]  this is a lot of fun. I'm quiet. I know I'm not having any fun. No, don't say that. I'm
[3088.73s -> 3105.69s]  not having fun. I've definitely come to appreciate pyro a lot more in like the,
[3107.24s -> 3118.49s]  in the second kind of half of my kind of online life. It's like, wow, pyro is good. I always like
[3118.49s -> 3133.94s]  pyro though. All right. I got to pay attention. I actually, I'm going to be quiet for real.
[3134.50s -> 3146.73s]  It's funny. I'll say that about spy too, right? You get, you get absolutely dominated by spy.
[3146.73s -> 3150.89s]  That's just kicking everybody's ass in the server. And you're like, oh, what the fuck? Like, fuck you.
[3152.17s -> 3158.01s]  Fuck you. And then you play spy and like bump into three walls and don't hit anybody. You face stab
[3158.01s -> 3164.66s]  a person and die instantly. And you do, you're zero for your team. And it's just like, oh,
[3165.22s -> 3170.74s]  right. This is like kind of like, it takes like a lot of skill to really kind of do this reliably.
[3173.53s -> 3191.27s]  Forgot. Yes. All right. Three minutes. And then I'm going to pay attention.
[3191.83s -> 3201.61s]  I'm actually kind of excited about opening those boxes. It's been a long time since I've done
[3201.61s -> 3222.52s]  something like that. Really. It's time for some loot get. That's right. Where's that magnet?
[3223.08s -> 3241.50s]  There it is. This is the second one too. Oh, burn chance or yeah. No, I think I'm taking crit
[3241.50s -> 3245.66s]  because the boss is about to run in. I'd rather be able to do damage quickly.
[3249.08s -> 3263.88s]  Yeah. Holy shit. That's so much. It's hard to even see because it's coming in so much.
[3264.44s -> 3292.15s]  What is going on? Okay. More crit. Level 60. More crit. All right. I'm ready for the boss.
[3292.71s -> 3302.52s]  I'm only going to take health regen now if I see it. Health and health regen is the only
[3302.52s -> 3332.62s]  thing I'm going to pick up. I got to turn on auto attack. There it is. Because I want to
[3332.62s -> 3339.30s]  auto attack the boss and just focus on moving around. Nice. It's got a health push, I think.
[3339.86s -> 3356.02s]  What about viewfinder? That's what we will open with next week. That's the
[3356.82s -> 3360.94s]  because I do really want to play that game. It looked really just like a nice experience.
[3364.60s -> 3398.02s]  All right. 40 seconds or so. I'm getting kind of collapsed on here. Good. Oh, I think taking the
[3398.02s -> 3402.44s]  50 health is better because in the amount of time it would take me to get 50 health from this,
[3402.44s -> 3416.52s]  it would be too late. All right. Let's do it. Yeah. I want to beat it with a second character.
[3416.52s -> 3477.02s]  Come on. All right. Here we go. Fucking that pole just screwed everything up.
[3477.02s -> 3482.92s]  I'm good. Get away from these poles. They're ruining everything.
[3483.56s -> 3513.05s]  Actually just ruin the whole run. Oh, shit. I didn't have enough movement speed and those
[3513.05s -> 3525.19s]  poles ruined everything. When he does the three in a row, they're like, if you don't have enough
[3525.19s -> 3543.35s]  movement speed, you're going to get hit no matter what. All right. Oh, let's do it again. What did
[3543.35s -> 3558.02s]  I? Well, shit. I didn't look at the unlocks. Where is it? Milestone story swift is an arrow.
[3558.02s -> 3580.30s]  There it is. All right. I got 750 gold for this one. I already got that money stream of fire
[3580.30s -> 3592.71s]  traits. What did I unlock? Are you going to abandon sorcery? No, we'll at the very least,
[3592.71s -> 3606.33s]  we will conclude. We will conclude sorcery. I'm telling you. Didn't I deposit the oh shit.
[3606.33s -> 3624.02s]  I have to buy it. That's right. I want that. You have 4% additional damage for each burning enemy
[3624.02s -> 3653.72s]  up to 60%. I like the fire character. It's very good. I think I'm good with this attack.
[3654.04s -> 3675.56s]  Maybe just more damage. Just straight up damage. This is becoming a problem. So more health and
[3675.56s -> 3683.38s]  regen in the beginning. It's a new game you're looking forward to the most. The Elden Ring DLC.
[3683.38s -> 3698.65s]  I don't think anything even compares. All right. I'm going again. That hasn't been announced.
[3698.65s -> 3706.94s]  That was a great spawn. Radiant aura. Cast light that distributes its damage equally among all
[3706.94s -> 3723.53s]  foes in its range. Automatically cast in intervals. Let's try it. Ah, I like this a lot. They announced
[3723.53s -> 3726.33s]  the Elden Ring DLC. They didn't announce when it was coming out. They announced it was being
[3726.33s -> 3738.23s]  worked on. I actually just shit my pants. I feel bad for you because it sucks when that happens.
[3738.23s -> 3749.43s]  Genuinely, it's really not fun. Yeah. Sorry about that. You know what's funny about what
[3749.43s -> 3753.59s]  you just said though? Imagine shitting your pants and sitting there after shitting your pants. You
[3753.59s -> 3762.26s]  just did it. And typing into a chat, hey, I just shit my pants for real. Why are you just sitting
[3762.26s -> 3769.80s]  there? Like, okay. You should probably go take care of it first, then talk about it. I think
[3769.80s -> 3780.18s]  that that's probably a good order of operations there. Now, it would have been even funnier if
[3780.18s -> 3787.26s]  you wrote, oh my God, I just shit my pants comma space. What do I do? That would have added a little
[3787.26s -> 3792.78s]  bit for me because that means you're just still sitting there and you're just like, I don't know
[3792.78s -> 3810.09s]  what to do about this. Please stop. I'm eating. Sometimes I forget that because I'm this way too.
[3810.09s -> 3818.46s]  Anytime the TV is on or anytime I'm watching any media, food is part of the picture at least 70 to
[3818.46s -> 3827.21s]  80 percent of the time. That is a food activity, sitting and watching something for me. So I forget
[3827.21s -> 3837.29s]  that sometimes that if I was just sitting there, oh my God, I got my delicious spread. I've got my
[3837.29s -> 3844.90s]  lunch and my dinner. It's right here. And the person I was watching was just like talking about,
[3845.62s -> 3851.67s]  yeah, I get it. But then again, I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about.
[3852.55s -> 3860.54s]  And that's it. That's all I'm going to say. I'm not going to change it.
[3860.54s -> 3867.67s]  I'm stacking health regen first. Open crates. I probably shouldn't have told you guys I was
[3867.67s -> 3874.89s]  going to do that. We're getting all caps open crates now. I probably shouldn't have even said
[3874.89s -> 3898.98s]  I was doing that. Open those crates. Hurry. I will. I will just chill crates now. Stop playing this
[3898.98s -> 3910.36s]  game and gamble already. Hey, by the way, when each crate opens, we all have to like rub our
[3910.36s -> 3927.72s]  hands together like this. Hey, buddy, the. Hold on. Hey, buddy, the blood trail alters give you
[3927.72s -> 3935.53s]  buffs. I thought it was OK. Well, thank I appreciate the spoiler. I actually kind of do.
[3936.41s -> 3940.57s]  I mean, I like to kind of figure these games out sometimes, but sometimes you really just this is
[3940.57s -> 3944.41s]  no way to know what the hell is even going on in these games. I thought when I picked up both of
[3944.41s -> 3948.89s]  those pieces and went to the altar or whatever, that it was going to spawn a hard boss, but it's
[3948.89s -> 3974.58s]  going to give me an item to help with the boss. So I guess I'll do it. One of these two. Can you
[3974.58s -> 3982.79s]  please put family guy clips in the corner? No. Blue ones are special. Wait, which ones?
[3990.54s -> 3997.24s]  Needles is probably better for this exact build right now. What? I'm playing the new version of
[3997.24s -> 4002.20s]  the game. I forgot the beta is out, right? So there is new stuff here. Oh, cool. All right.
[4002.20s -> 4009.46s]  Yeah, this is the beta is out. It's in beta. There's a bunch of new stuff. I can be so mean
[4009.46s -> 4019.66s]  to us. I'm not. You're interpreting me. My. Sorry, I lost something. I want to. There we go.
[4019.66s -> 4029.66s]  Is this the beta version? I imagine so, because I didn't have this light radius thing before.
[4030.22s -> 4041.24s]  You have to subscribe to the beta to access it. Oh, well, shit. You have to put the game.
[4041.24s -> 4046.57s]  You have to go into the beta change on Steam. I'll be playing this again. So it doesn't matter.
[4046.57s -> 4050.57s]  This is a fun game just to kind of play for like a few hours. It got caught lying.
[4052.30s -> 4060.20s]  I didn't get caught lying. I didn't have correct info. I thought that there was a patch to the
[4060.20s -> 4063.72s]  game that was because it was like, hey, the game's going into beta. So I'm like, oh, maybe it's I
[4063.72s -> 4085.85s]  guess it's in beta. Steam auto updates everything. Steam is auto updating, right? That's not how
[4085.85s -> 4092.20s]  betas work. All right. The game is an early access game. I thought it was just going to
[4092.92s -> 4096.60s]  be. Hey, we're in like we're considered to be in beta now. We didn't update.
[4097.32s -> 4107.42s]  It takes like five seconds to do it. Is it going to mess with my save file? Does it make a different
[4107.42s -> 4133.08s]  save file or can I just do it after this run? You'll be fine. Yeah, I'll turn it on. What pizza
[4133.08s -> 4138.18s]  topping should you get? Pepperoni is easy. Doesn't weigh it down. I don't like when pizza gets weighed
[4138.18s -> 4143.96s]  down. You pick the thing up and the thing flops over like a fucking like it's a t-shirt. Like
[4143.96s -> 4155.48s]  coming out of the fucking dryer. Like, no, no, thanks. To me, toppings on a pizza should always
[4155.48s -> 4167.00s]  be always small enough to be able to not cause a flop problem. For instance, meat lovers pizza,
[4167.00s -> 4174.94s]  I find to be just I don't find I don't want to order it because it's not a it's a lasagna
[4174.94s -> 4177.34s]  because you're going to get it out of the bar. You're going to take the piece out. You're going
[4177.34s -> 4180.70s]  to put it on a plate and it's going to just be falling apart like a fucking lasagna. It's a
[4180.70s -> 4191.78s]  lasagna. Just eat it. Just eat a lasagna. He's a meat hater. No, it's just it's about weight.
[4192.98s -> 4197.62s]  I love sausage on pizza. I love, you know, like hamburger on pizza. I like pepperoni on pizza. I
[4197.62s -> 4204.52s]  like bacon on pizza. I just don't want all of them on piled on at the same time. It's all about
[4206.23s -> 4213.69s]  just, you know, the distribution. Meat haters pizza. There's just a bunch of lettuce on it.
[4220.47s -> 4232.36s]  This build sucks. It's been five minutes. I think I'm doing okay. Veggie pizza does go hard.
[4233.50s -> 4241.38s]  I like vegetables on pizza, but again, the same rule applies. Peppers and onions. Okay, nice.
[4241.94s -> 4253.83s]  Peppers and onions. Peppers and onions and olives though. No, that's one too many. No,
[4253.83s -> 4269.88s]  peppers and onions. Please don't say go hard. Just trying to fit in. Does he know that this tomato
[4269.88s -> 4285.21s]  sauce on pizza? No, I had no idea. I thought it was um, that's a boomer Andy take. I don't think so.
[4285.21s -> 4308.70s]  I don't think that's a boomer take. I'm going for defense this time. What about flavored crust? I
[4308.70s -> 4314.06s]  think stuffed crust pizza is amazing. Something about the way that it bakes inside the dough. I
[4314.06s -> 4320.09s]  don't know why, but it, it doesn't taste like any other cheese I've ever eaten and I can't,
[4320.09s -> 4327.11s]  you cannot, it's impossible to replicate. It's impossible. However, stuffed crust pizza gets made.
[4327.11s -> 4337.74s]  I don't know how, but it just tastes so much better than if I don't know. It's a completely,
[4337.74s -> 4351.64s]  it's like a weird unique flavor. It's really good. What's the worst pizza topping? Um, probably ham.
[4351.64s -> 4366.15s]  I don't get, I just, ham to me is just, what do you mean? What, what, what wrong, wrong? I know,
[4366.15s -> 4374.44s]  but it's just not, a lot of times you get ham on pizza. It's like that cubed ham, the cubes.
[4374.44s -> 4387.42s]  I don't really want cubed ham on pizza. He does actually hate meat. I don't know if you were here
[4387.42s -> 4393.40s]  three days ago, but I talked about eating corned beef hash out of the can. Not in the way that you
[4393.40s -> 4405.35s]  think. I don't, that's not accurate. What should I take? I'm going to take these and deposit them
[4405.35s -> 4418.50s]  because this is like a tank. So maybe eventually I can make like a tank run. They sell corned beef
[4418.50s -> 4429.66s]  hash in a can. I, yeah, that's like how you, that's how you get it. Unless you go to a breakfast
[4429.66s -> 4437.21s]  place and they make it kind of fresh to order. The egg hash corned beef hot sauce concoction sounds
[4437.21s -> 4444.01s]  fucking awesome. It's, it is, it's wonderful. For those of you that weren't here, I'm going to,
[4444.01s -> 4451.78s]  I'll tell you again. Serving of the corned beef hash out of the can, put it in, you heat it up
[4451.78s -> 4459.66s]  on the stove. Get it nice to exactly where you want it. Do one, one like over medium egg or over
[4459.66s -> 4465.98s]  easy, over hard, however you like it. That goes on top. You're going to doop, doop, doop, doop with
[4465.98s -> 4472.66s]  Tabasco right on top of the egg. You're going to have one slice of toast and you're going to have
[4472.66s -> 4478.74s]  three heirloom tomatoes that have been cooked potentially in the oven. You're going to make
[4478.74s -> 4485.99s]  more than three probably because you know, you're making this just nice and slow, low.
[4487.53s -> 4490.17s]  Those tomatoes, you know, you're not trying to cook them. You're just trying to kind of heat
[4490.17s -> 4496.23s]  them up a little. That's stoner food. No, it is not. That is, that is a great breakfast. If you
[4496.23s -> 4499.99s]  go to a breakfast place, they definitely have a corned beef hash meal and it is what I just
[4499.99s -> 4520.09s]  described to you. It is the exact thing I just told you. Make it for me then. Some of you are
[4520.09s -> 4524.97s]  going to do it. Even if you don't do the tomato part, I would say you should probably put something
[4524.97s -> 4533.96s]  on there. That's not just eggs and meat. You know, something to give you a little bit of your
[4534.60s -> 4552.52s]  vegetable count for the day. I'm going to go down. You'd add rice to that. However you want to
[4553.16s -> 4572.63s]  make it yours, right? Go for it. That's just how I do it. Bigfoot or Sasquatch? Do you confirm or
[4572.63s -> 4581.85s]  deny? What is it? Is it Bigfoot or Sasquatch or is it Bigfoot and Sasquatch? What's your question?
[4582.65s -> 4588.17s]  Are you asking if it's Bigfoot or Sasquatch or are you asking if I think they both exist?
[4589.05s -> 4607.19s]  I think it's two different people. Are there any cryptids that you believe in strongly?
[4608.87s -> 4617.72s]  Um, not necessarily. I mean, I do think there's probably stuff in the deep sea that we haven't
[4617.72s -> 4622.92s]  seen that could be to the level of what you're describing. Look at the weird animals that are
[4622.92s -> 4630.60s]  down there. There are animals that have lights on their heads. There are some really wacky deep sea
[4630.60s -> 4639.96s]  creatures. We have not really seen it all. So I'm one of those people where if it's kind of possible
[4639.96s -> 4648.31s]  then it's possible. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the Loch Ness Monster is,
[4648.31s -> 4655.34s]  you know, 10,000 feet deep in the ocean. I know it. I don't know. Maybe. Possible. I don't know.
[4655.98s -> 4673.83s]  Do I think there's a big naked guy walking around in the woods behind your backyard?
[4673.91s -> 4684.65s]  No, not necessarily. I don't, I don't know. Like do I think there's like a like a 15 foot
[4684.65s -> 4693.29s]  hairy naked guy that's walking around just kind of hanging out in the woods? I don't think so.
[4693.29s -> 4717.77s]  I could, I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. If you ever do see Bigfoot,
[4717.77s -> 4725.74s]  I feel like, I don't know, would Bigfoot just run? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Another person saw me.
[4725.74s -> 4731.43s]  Oh, I'm naked and I'm running around. Or would Bigfoot be like, listen, I know this is fucked up
[4731.43s -> 4736.09s]  looking and I know, you know, you found me. But let me tell you something. I've got a secret bank
[4736.09s -> 4743.45s]  account in that secret bank account. I've got fucking $6 million. Don't say shit. And I will,
[4743.45s -> 4749.38s]  I will fucking sell you the money. I'll sell you a fucking $10,000 a day. I don't know.
[4749.38s -> 4771.24s]  It's piercing work with the fire. He can speak. I don't know. Scammer Bigfoot.
[4772.12s -> 4779.98s]  You can just listen. Let me tell you something. I've got a bank account with $10 million in it.
[4779.98s -> 4793.02s]  All you need to do is you need to send me 50 and then I'll send you 10,000 next week.
[4793.02s -> 4808.36s]  Bigfoot's a scammer? That's not, that's not what I meant. But that's funny. You're my favorite
[4808.36s -> 4819.13s]  popsicle streamer. Can we, can we do the email that has not been put in the chat in like six
[4819.13s -> 4836.42s]  years? I think that's what they're referring to. Yep. Always take that every time. If you're the
[4836.42s -> 4858.49s]  fire character, it's a quick tip for you. The movement speed is what absolutely killed me last
[4858.49s -> 4862.44s]  time. So I got to focus on it for a little bit. I'm never going to play this game. Don't give me
[4862.44s -> 4868.28s]  any tips. So let me, I have to tell you, don't say that you're never going to do something.
[4869.46s -> 4874.98s]  Trust me. I have experience here saying you're never going to do something in the one small
[4874.98s -> 4881.35s]  off chance that you do, that you end up doing that. You're going to think back and go,
[4881.35s -> 4900.12s]  I should never have said I'm never ever doing this. I'm not though. But what if like in like
[4900.12s -> 4916.34s]  a year you come back and it's like your favorite game, dude? You never know. I want that archman.
[4916.98s -> 4929.48s]  I will never trust Bigfoot. You're calling me Bigfoot. Like, oh, Jerma is Bigfoot. He's
[4929.48s -> 4933.96s]  Jerma is a cryptid. He's Bigfoot. Don't you guys make fun of how small I am all the time?
[4934.68s -> 4938.97s]  What's going on there? Yeah, there's, there's a lack of consistency.
[4939.77s -> 4961.75s]  Like a consistency, small foot. That's not even, that's not even funny. That's not, that is so
[4961.75s -> 4990.17s]  easy. Come on. You're not Bigfoot. You're small foot. That's easy. That's way too easy. So boss,
[4999.00s -> 5008.20s]  that thing is doing a lot of work. I'll take this again. The boss. All right, back up. Did I pick
[5008.20s -> 5025.82s]  anything? Yeah, I did. I'm going to deposit the boots. There's no way you can be Bigfoot. You
[5025.82s -> 5036.65s]  smell like ranch and there's no ranch in the woods. Why can't I just take a bottle of ranch
[5036.65s -> 5040.81s]  into the woods and drink it in the woods? Well, I don't understand the logic behind that. There's
[5040.81s -> 5062.15s]  no ranch in the woods. Why can't I just have it in my backpack while I'm walking around? I kind
[5062.15s -> 5082.38s]  of shredded that guy. Um, I'm not going to use this, but I'd rather deposit these because I want
[5082.38s -> 5088.71s]  to be able to make a tanky character. Why are you not denying that you smell like ranch? I don't
[5088.71s -> 5105.21s]  smell like ranch dressing. I don't even like ranch dressing, ranch dressing to me. And you're
[5105.21s -> 5114.36s]  going to think I'm gross. This is the take that a lot of people determine if they like you as a
[5114.36s -> 5126.04s]  person or not, which is like relax. I think that ranch is just a, it's just to me, I like blue cheese
[5126.04s -> 5138.38s]  better anywhere I would be putting ranch blue cheese is used in that scenario. What should I
[5138.38s -> 5148.60s]  take here? Ranch to me is just not quite there. And I would prefer blue cheese to be the thing
[5148.60s -> 5157.24s]  instead of ranch. I get that opinion because I'm a huge Buffalo chicken fan. Buffalo chicken is
[5158.63s -> 5163.64s]  probably my favorite food. One of the top three favorite foods ever. And that combination has
[5163.64s -> 5180.18s]  just been burned in my brain forever. This dude eats crayons. He's lying. If they're dipped in
[5180.18s -> 5186.55s]  blue cheese. Um, no, I don't, don't give them any more. Don't give them anything else. Don't
[5186.55s -> 5190.79s]  give them anything else. That'll be, that'll be, that'll be, that'll be on like Twitter.
[5190.79s -> 5196.42s]  Everybody eats crayons. Everybody eats, everybody eats crayons. Everybody eats crayons. Hey, did you
[5196.42s -> 5201.82s]  hear? Everybody eats fucking crayons today. No, don't give them anything else. Don't give them
[5201.82s -> 5217.38s]  anything more. It's X now idiot. Oh, oh, that's right. It is. I, okay. All right. What are you
[5217.38s -> 5224.76s]  talking? Okay. Well, whatever. I'll see you on, I'll see you on X. Is that what it is? That it is
[5224.76s -> 5239.75s]  what it is. Yeah. No one said that. Don't call it that. I, I don't pay very much attention to
[5239.75s -> 5246.15s]  Twitter. I don't even use social media. I don't know what the fuck is going on. Guys. I use
[5246.15s -> 5261.34s]  Twitter to like DM people and tell you when the stream is taking this DMing, like other content
[5261.34s -> 5266.54s]  creators and streamers for, Oh, Hey, you want to, I'm doing this like house flipper thing.
[5267.66s -> 5275.72s]  Like that's what I use Twitter for is, is for like talk, talking to colleagues.
[5276.28s -> 5294.44s]  How come you didn't DM me because I'm not going to bro. I actually think I had a pretty good one.
[5294.44s -> 5309.14s]  Let me see. Let me see. Let me look at my notes. Let's see. Did I have a good one? I feel like I'd
[5309.14s -> 5340.52s]  had one recently. Maybe not. Really? I thought I did. Damn. I still have the whole, um,
[5341.16s -> 5354.82s]  Adam Sandler movie notes. No shit. I fell off big time. Yeah. I fell off. Absolutely. I completely
[5354.82s -> 5363.75s]  fell off. I thought I had a couple of like draft reads for you guys. Yeah. I fell off. That's all
[5363.75s -> 5384.65s]  right. He's well, he's washed up now. He's all washed up. Hey, I'd rather be all washed up than
[5384.65s -> 5426.94s]  dirty. Hmm. Okay. Dad. Minus two, minus two. No, no, no. Stop that. Minus two dad. That's something
[5426.94s -> 5454.12s]  that I would be. Cry me a river, small foot. Ban that person for life. Do it actually. Execute order
[5454.12s -> 5492.04s]  number 666. Too many, too many Dantas. Too many Dantas. Too many. Somebody's on stage doing that.
[5492.04s -> 5497.96s]  And like the whole crowd's like, too many. These are too many of these. Stop it. Boo. Stop. Too many.
[5497.96s -> 5502.95s]  Too many. This dude's just got the microphone going.
[5505.67s -> 5515.14s]  He will get up and leave. All right. No, he really, he really just fucking washed up now.
[5515.14s -> 5521.30s]  Yeah. Like that was, that was awful. You hear how many times you do the Star Wars, like interlude
[5521.30s -> 5543.62s]  thing. Like he fucking fell off. All right. I'm going to the well. I can take a lot more hits.
[5543.62s -> 5558.65s]  This is great. I'm actually happy about this. All right. Well then magnet. I went to hash house
[5558.65s -> 5576.15s]  at Gogo recently. It was pretty nice. This is great at the link. All right. I'm depositing the
[5576.15s -> 5589.26s]  tank boots. It feels going to be better. All right. And then I'm going to do well. Then let's do blood
[5589.26s -> 5599.32s]  stain first. Blood stain first because I want to see what that does. I need movement speed
[5600.44s -> 5612.87s]  and damage going forward. Really, really, really important because I'm way too slow right now.
[5613.43s -> 5643.86s]  Whoa. Really? Double flamethrower. Is it a double flamethrower? Oh, that's actually kind of insane.
[5643.86s -> 5658.02s]  All right. Attack speed or let's just max this out. It's so much worse now. It's a,
[5658.02s -> 5661.80s]  that's going to be a boss killer though. I think it should be really good against boss.
[5668.22s -> 5700.95s]  All right. Let's get the first one and nine, eight, okay. Burn chance. All right. Now we go
[5700.95s -> 5706.97s]  to the other side or should I get the, I'm going to go, while there's still 10 minutes,
[5706.97s -> 5709.53s]  I'm going to get this first and then we're going to go to the well and then get the second piece.
[5710.17s -> 5735.43s]  All right. So when I have the full pieces, where do I take it back to that? They alter. You don't.
[5735.43s -> 5741.50s]  You just hold it. Oh, what does it do? All right. I need movement speed now.
[5742.14s -> 5746.78s]  Stop. I got to stop picking stuff. That's not moving speed. This is becoming a problem.
[5747.58s -> 5772.74s]  You married into it. Oh, why would you come back then? We'd be closed.
[5772.74s -> 5789.03s]  Movement speed. Take it. Yes. Just do it. I know the other one's good, but I'm going to get a bunch
[5789.03s -> 5824.25s]  of levels right now. Again, do it again. Back speed again, moving speed, more health, more piercing.
[5824.25s -> 5836.47s]  All right. I don't even think I don't have to get the magnet anymore because I just got two of them.
[5836.47s -> 5840.55s]  Putting it up your whole life. You just don't know. You need to call it.
[5841.91s -> 5851.51s]  I need to know what I stand to win. Stand to win everything. Call it. Well done. That is my favorite
[5851.51s -> 5870.92s]  scene of any movie ever. I think it is. Look at that melting. This is, and this is an act boss,
[5872.17s -> 5889.02s]  right? This is like act two. Gone. Dead. You think Bigfoot would enjoy your screams?
[5889.02s -> 5892.14s]  No, Bigfoot's probably one of the people in here just like talking shit every day.
[5894.39s -> 5910.33s]  I wouldn't be surprised. I imagine like, you know, like a lot of like the boxing is like really kind
[5910.33s -> 5914.57s]  of coming back. Like a lot of people getting involved in boxing. There's like chest boxing and
[5914.57s -> 5920.06s]  there's like, you know, creator clash and like there's a lot of like boxing events. What if
[5920.06s -> 5924.86s]  somebody boxed Bigfoot and Bigfoot just beat the ever living fucking shit out of this person?
[5930.70s -> 5936.06s]  It's like, oh, like German versus Bigfoot. And we find somebody that's like literally fucking
[5936.06s -> 5941.74s]  eight feet tall. That's like three or four hundred pounds jacked. Unbelievable in unbelievable
[5941.74s -> 5946.62s]  condition. And I think I can win. And I just get the absolute fucking shit beat out of me.
[5947.34s -> 5955.67s]  Like it's ridiculous. It is ridiculous. And it shows me before the fight signing a bunch of
[5955.67s -> 5970.33s]  documents saying, do not stop this fight. I will win. And he just like picks me up overhead and
[5970.33s -> 5983.38s]  like throws me into the fucking crowd after like six straight minutes of like, like to my face.
[5984.02s -> 5998.39s]  And then zoom in on some people in the front row that are holding stacks of money,
[6000.18s -> 6004.58s]  the cigars and the emails cheering because it's like, oh my God, this was free money.
[6004.58s -> 6031.42s]  This was so much fucking. This was so free. Now, why would you lose? Because that's funny.
[6031.98s -> 6039.46s]  I don't even want to throw one punch. I want to taunt in the ring when the bell rings
[6039.46s -> 6042.74s]  and then it's just me being hit in the head over and over again.
[6051.00s -> 6054.87s]  I go out to the outside of the ring and I'm picking up like objects to hit him with.
[6054.87s -> 6059.99s]  Like this is illegal. Like, like it's over. The fight's over. I've been disqualified.
[6059.99s -> 6063.27s]  I'm picking up like mic stands and trying to hit him in the fucking head with it and stuff.
[6063.27s -> 6086.82s]  Like I've already lied. I've been disqualified. It's personal at this point. This is a Yakuza
[6086.82s -> 6105.22s]  sub story. No, I'll never truly step into the ring. I couldn't. All the medical problems I
[6105.22s -> 6126.18s]  still have now. It's a fun little thing to think about, but no, I really want to just stand still
[6126.18s -> 6133.05s]  right here. Oh, I can't fuck shit. All right. All right. Don't I've got four minutes. Don't lose it
[6133.05s -> 6140.70s]  now. Where's my movement speed? Pause the tank boots and we got to go. Oh, wait, the other
[6140.70s -> 6160.18s]  blood stain. I'll do that right now. Am I going the right way? It's not here. There's so much
[6160.18s -> 6185.54s]  shit here. I can't get it all. How do I feel? I still feel like I'm so slow. All right. Get in
[6185.54s -> 6194.31s]  the ring with Bigfoot and it's like a big deal. We do weigh-ins. Yeah. Let's take, let's take a look.
[6194.31s -> 6200.63s]  Bigfoot has a about 40 inches of reach on a, on German 985, which is not surprising.
[6217.83s -> 6227.22s]  Only 40. I don't know. I don't know much about how that works. All right. There's the other piece
[6227.78s -> 6242.78s]  coming to my eye. Come on, get out of my eye. All right. I got the whole thing now.
[6243.34s -> 6248.10s]  So now what? What does this do for me now? Do I have to do anything special or just fight the boss
[6248.10s -> 6268.33s]  with it on? I'm looking for health and movement speed. Just fight the boss. Okay. You're never
[6268.33s -> 6272.95s]  going to open crates. Uh, we're going to do it after this. Whatever happens in this run.
[6281.46s -> 6302.79s]  Face damage. Yeah. So short. There's money down here. Okay. I think, uh, like I said,
[6302.79s -> 6308.94s]  in one of the tank boots, I think that's an interesting thing to build whole health.
[6308.94s -> 6312.78s]  Holy shit. All right. All right. All right. There's no excuse now. I see movement speed.
[6312.78s -> 6324.58s]  I have to get it. It doesn't matter what else is up there. I still feel like I'm a little
[6324.58s -> 6345.64s]  too slow, but I'll, I'll concentrate. I'll try these. This is the boss killer build right now.
[6345.64s -> 6355.40s]  It's not the clear waves build. Ooh, head this way quick. Oh, get it all. Attack speed damage.
[6357.46s -> 6385.88s]  Yes. Movement speed. Uh, crit chance or attack speed. All right. That's going to be it. I hope
[6385.88s -> 6421.27s]  this is enough. No, it's hard to see the fire in front of me. Healing potion. Oh my God.
[6427.06s -> 6438.18s]  Movement speed or health. What the fuck? He's dead. I already, I don't, I see, I killed him.
[6438.18s -> 6477.54s]  He's already dead. What did so much damage? Something hurt a lot. Whoa. Trying to keep
[6477.54s -> 6501.35s]  him close. Not that close though. Oh, the item. That's right. Ooh, you survived and I got the
[6501.35s -> 6509.35s]  item. It's the item. Holy shit. That thing is incredible. Thanks for telling me that.
[6516.30s -> 6531.96s]  Unlocks trait type, spin and puncture, money, and then the rat ring. Very nice. Is it available to
[6531.96s -> 6543.00s]  buy? Or is it just now in the item pool? Cool. I think I'm getting ready to be able to do the
[6543.00s -> 6553.99s]  second level. What is this one? Level 100 kill 50,000 enemies with effects. All right. So this
[6553.99s -> 6558.49s]  character is all the upgrades are available. Everything is available. It's just money now.
[6562.70s -> 6570.01s]  Cool. All right. Let's open some crates in TF2. Probably only going to be live for like another
[6570.01s -> 6576.23s]  30, 40 minutes. I know this is a short one, but yeah, I'm just streaming when I can. And when I
[6576.23s -> 6585.58s]  think I feel like it, when I think I'm having a good time. Here we are. It's time to gamble.
[6586.14s -> 6594.87s]  Gamble. Oh, I'm not going to buy these yet because I don't know which one I want. All right. I'm
[6594.87s -> 6600.12s]  going to just take a quick pee break. When I come back, we'll open some crates. We can examine them,
[6600.12s -> 6605.56s]  see if they're any good. I've only got like 20 keys. I know that's, that's a lot, but I don't
[6605.56s -> 6611.19s]  want to like overdo it. I'm just trying to clear out some of the old cases that I have. We'll see.
[6611.19s -> 6612.95s]  I'll be right back.
