[0.31s -> 23.26s]  Asperdergo, no, that's not my name. My name is Captain Blackbeard. I can't fix it. I can't- what? I can't be Captain Blackbeard, I can be Captain Blackbear. That's not happening.
[23.26s -> 32.70s]  I've decided to change my name, ladies and gentlemen. For reasons unbeknownst to anybody, I'm now going to be Captain Humphreys.
[32.70s -> 49.16s]  His teeth are so white. That's not a pirate. Pirates don't have bright white crest commercial teeth. No, seriously, this guy's teeth are like perfect.
[49.16s -> 60.92s]  What about this guy's teeth? They're great. This is fucking up my immersion.
[60.92s -> 65.92s]  Okay. Are you ready for the pirate to attack with his dual blades?
[65.92s -> 71.10s]  Yeah, I mean, I guess I could attack you with these. Yeah, whatever. I don't know. I just kinda don't care.
[71.10s -> 75.10s]  Did I get you? Did I get you? I'll just keep walking.
[75.10s -> 84.11s]  See, these are like the redcoats. It's the British. The British are coming. Tell Paul Revere.
[84.11s -> 90.57s]  You British need to leave our lands at once.
[90.57s -> 95.22s]  What? He doesn't know I'm right here?
[95.22s -> 102.13s]  What are they doing to that poor guy? That guy's gonna get... What is happening right now?
[102.13s -> 110.07s]  Is that a chicken? What are these chickens? Dude, look at these giant chickens. Oh, that's a turtle.
[110.07s -> 121.50s]  I thought it was like a turkey. I thought it was a turkey. Hi, I'm Mr. Assassin Creed Man.
[121.50s -> 126.50s]  That's a nice big gun you got there.
[126.50s -> 131.23s]  Dude, that was sick.
[131.23s -> 138.99s]  Y'all know how it goes. I've been captain of this boat for long enough.
[138.99s -> 143.99s]  It's time to sing the pirate song that we've been learning since we were two years old.
[143.99s -> 146.99s]  And it starts a little something like this.
[146.99s -> 150.99s]  The wind at our backs and the sun at the sea. None have ever been good to me.
[150.99s -> 154.99s]  Feel the waves crush through the sky. Into the deep air, yonder sky.
[154.99s -> 156.99s]  Drink in my hand and a trickle of my sleeves.
[156.99s -> 158.99s]  Looting and prendering's all that I crave.
[158.99s -> 161.99s]  Cast on the sails, release the brave. Tonight we dive.
[161.99s -> 163.99s]  Oh, shit.
[163.99s -> 165.99s]  Oh, shit.
[165.99s -> 169.55s]  Anybody on this boat have insurance?
[169.55s -> 171.55s]  What's insurance?
[171.55s -> 173.55s]  Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, go, go.
[173.55s -> 177.24s]  You're just a daydreaming office worker. That's like what this is.
[177.24s -> 183.55s]  Assassin's Creed IV is your daydreaming office worker.
[183.55s -> 190.24s]  Yeah, I may wear work socks, you know, but you know, I'm just gonna sit here at my cubicle, which is a cubicle.
[190.24s -> 194.24s]  I daydream about being a pirate and they like record my daydreams.
[194.24s -> 201.53s]  Got ourselves a fight here. Got ourselves a fight with the George Washingtons.
[201.53s -> 207.53s]  If you guys didn't know, the plot of this game of Assassin's Creed IV is George Washington cloned himself after the cherry tree incident.
[207.53s -> 213.53s]  And now he wants to try to take over the earth with his George Washington clones, but I ain't gonna let that happen.
[213.53s -> 215.77s]  Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[215.77s -> 219.77s]  What about your buddy? Your buddy's a fucking gonna get his neck broken too.
[219.77s -> 221.77s]  What about this guy? Fuck you.
[221.77s -> 223.77s]  You're all gonna get your heads punched in.
[223.77s -> 225.77s]  You're gonna get your head busted, broken, your fucking neck.
[225.77s -> 228.77s]  Yo, get the ear clapped. What is this? Oh, you want to get a double tap?
[228.77s -> 231.77s]  What about you? Oh, what's this? Ooh, ooh.
[231.77s -> 233.77s]  What's that? Chin punch, bitch.
[237.25s -> 240.87s]  What you working on? Ah, sanding.
[240.87s -> 246.05s]  I used to sand. It was a really tough job. Really good, honest day's work.
[246.05s -> 252.98s]  Fuck yourself.
[252.98s -> 256.61s]  Be careful. This is a pretty big, this is this ledge.
[256.61s -> 261.61s]  I know you just want to dance. That's great. But you know, that's not a safe place to be.
[261.61s -> 263.61s]  I told you, now you're all wet.
[263.61s -> 266.78s]  And that wasn't my fault, that was your fault.
[266.78s -> 269.78s]  And now everyone's going for a swim. Let's go.
[269.78s -> 271.78s]  Everyone's going for a swim. Get in.
[271.78s -> 274.86s]  Did they actually follow you in?
[274.86s -> 278.44s]  This one died.
[278.44s -> 281.26s]  Oh, I gotta kill somebody.
[282.69s -> 286.12s]  I almost just shit my pants when I did that, by the way.
[286.12s -> 288.81s]  I seriously almost just shit my pants when I just sneezed.
[288.81s -> 293.65s]  Did you hear? You know he shit his pants last night?
[293.65s -> 294.65s]  He sneezed.
[294.65s -> 295.65s]  That's gross.
[295.65s -> 298.65s]  Take a look for yourself, man. Right here, five minutes, 45 seconds.
[298.65s -> 300.65s]  Bang, shits his pants right there. How do you pull that off?
[300.65s -> 305.65s]  I don't know, but it's disgusting. He seriously disgusts me on another level that I can't even explain.
[305.65s -> 309.65s]  I mean, I shit my pants at least once a week, but I've never played in Assassin's Creed.
[309.65s -> 313.49s]  So I got MLC Stealth in the call here now.
[313.49s -> 318.49s]  We're going to go over some tips and some secret strategies that he knows about the Assassin's Creed multiplayer.
[318.49s -> 321.49s]  Because I know nothing. All I know is that I'm the Joker.
[321.49s -> 325.66s]  I'm playing as the Joker right now, and I need some secret tips from MLC Stealth.
[325.66s -> 329.86s]  Which does the Joker look like? Does he have a nose on his face?
[329.86s -> 335.55s]  No, the Joker. We're all the Joker. Every single person on our team is the Joker.
[335.55s -> 342.38s]  You can tell who a player is if they're jumping on roofs. That's normally what they do.
[342.38s -> 344.38s]  If they're moving quickly, it's a player.
[344.38s -> 347.38s]  You've got to sit there and hope they don't find you.
[347.38s -> 348.38s]  There's a guy.
[348.38s -> 349.38s]  You can't move. You can't budge.
[349.38s -> 353.13s]  I don't know what this guy's doing. Is that a bad guy?
[353.13s -> 354.13s]  No! Jesus!
[354.13s -> 356.13s]  He just has to remain still.
[356.13s -> 357.43s]  How did he...?
[357.43s -> 359.82s]  Hiding in a bush.
[359.82s -> 361.82s]  That's the way you do it. You hide in the bush.
[361.82s -> 364.82s]  Okay. Do I arrest this guy? Do I jump out and attack this guy?
[364.82s -> 365.82s]  Stealth, what do I do?
[365.82s -> 368.82s]  He's coming over here. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh my God.
[368.82s -> 370.82s]  I think I killed him.
[370.82s -> 371.82s]  You have stunned him. No, I ripped him out.
[371.82s -> 373.82s]  Stealth, how do I...? Do I arrest him? Do I kill him?
[373.82s -> 376.82s]  I'm like killing civilians right now. Stealth, what do I do?
[376.82s -> 377.82s]  Stealth!
[377.82s -> 380.51s]  Am I still on the Skype call?
[380.51s -> 389.02s]  Killed my brother!
[390.58s -> 392.58s]  We got a huge amount of waves coming.
[392.58s -> 394.58s]  Brace yourselves, crew!
[395.58s -> 399.90s]  Oh, we're going to crash directly into these people.
[400.90s -> 403.46s]  The boat's going to tip over.
[403.46s -> 405.70s]  Holy crap.
[406.70s -> 411.70s]  This one fateful day reminds me of a story.
[411.70s -> 418.56s]  Did I ever tell you the story about me old boys?
