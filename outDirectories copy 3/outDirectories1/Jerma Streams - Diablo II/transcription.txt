[1.08s -> 7.56s]  Hello. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Hope you're having a good afternoon, everybody.
[8.44s -> 22.18s]  I'm having a pretty good afternoon. Show yourself. Nah. Nah. He's early?
[23.16s -> 29.40s]  Well, the schedule changed a little bit today. It's gonna be during like 4 or 5 p.m. Pacific.
[32.22s -> 40.39s]  Change of plans, as you see. Apparently Joel is having PC problems. He got some new audio
[40.39s -> 44.87s]  equipment and he's walking up on them. So he's like, I'm just gonna troubleshoot it and I'm like,
[45.59s -> 58.18s]  go for it. Computers suck. Oh, I understand. PC gaming. When you set up your setup, he hates OBS.
[59.70s -> 68.54s]  What was he using before? Xsplit or something? Here comes the substitute teacher's voice.
[69.93s -> 76.26s]  Good morning, welcome class. I'm your substitute teacher. Today we're gonna learn how to do math
[76.26s -> 84.73s]  problems. Okay, thank you. All right, so what we're gonna do instead is something I've wanted
[84.73s -> 94.60s]  to do for a while and it should be interesting. Interesting as in it could go very, very, very
[94.60s -> 103.46s]  poorly very quickly or I'm gonna beat the whole damn game. I'm gonna play Diablo 2, straight up
[103.46s -> 113.56s]  Vanilla Diablo 2. Hardcore and you guys decide every single thing. You pick class, you pick the
[113.56s -> 122.54s]  stat points and you pick the skill points. So you're already dead. You are already dead. Yes.
[123.66s -> 134.76s]  Something like that. Oh, that's a terrible idea. I actually was freaking out about this because
[134.76s -> 140.04s]  I brought this up to be like a month or two ago and somebody in the chat said, dude, you're gonna
[140.04s -> 149.48s]  die to corpse fire. And I'm like, don't fucking say that. Don't say that because I might and it's
[151.08s -> 157.85s]  if you know, you know. When corpse fire dies, it's like eight minutes into the game. There is a
[157.85s -> 163.77s]  chance that the computer will hang for three seconds and he's going to explode and you'll die.
[166.41s -> 175.96s]  It happens. I have to be very careful but I'm going to leave most decisions up to you. Now
[176.52s -> 184.47s]  you will not have the decision of choosing weapons and items because if you give me a complete and
[184.47s -> 191.35s]  total dickhead build and make me use a club as a source verse or something like I'm I mean,
[191.35s -> 194.47s]  I'm going to pick the items. I'm not just going to be naked and shit like this is not going to happen
[197.98s -> 203.27s]  but it should be fun. I also found out something interesting today that I didn't know because why
[203.27s -> 212.84s]  would I know this? My Diablo II account is banned from Battle.net for some particular reason. I don't
[212.84s -> 228.06s]  know why. I can't. I'm apparently been shadow banned. I didn't do anything. I don't know when
[228.06s -> 237.11s]  this happened. I haven't played Diablo II in at least a couple of years but apparently I did
[237.11s -> 247.77s]  something wrong. I'm not sure what it was and here's the worst part about that. Diablo II is
[247.77s -> 258.22s]  in a funny position right now on Battle.net where I can't buy another copy. I can't. To get a new
[258.22s -> 272.65s]  CD key I can't purchase another copy. Maybe it was a mod? I don't know. I can buy a copy for a friend
[273.61s -> 280.34s]  so I'm gonna have to eventually if I want to play online buy a copy for a friend send it to
[280.34s -> 293.53s]  their email and then tell them to give me the CD key. What? Why would you buy again?
[294.71s -> 300.23s]  Well what am I supposed to do? Call Blizzard support? Hey uh I don't know what happened like
[300.23s -> 307.03s]  four years ago. I have no idea but I think I've been shadow banned on Diablo II. What are they
[307.03s -> 321.75s]  gonna do? They don't give a shit about Diablo II anymore. You know I would assume if they could
[321.75s -> 334.87s]  just delete Diablo II off the store they would. I'm not gonna call Blizzard. But anyways so I was
[334.87s -> 340.63s]  under the assumption that I might be able to get a little help if I needed it. No I have to do this
[340.63s -> 351.90s]  alone for the best maybe. I was thinking maybe oh fuck this is gonna be impossible for me to do this
[351.98s -> 358.70s]  alone. Hey I know some of you guys have D2 get on like just kill kill on Dario for me whatever
[358.70s -> 369.53s]  it's for the stream. I can't do that now I have to do it all myself. Without further ado we are
[369.53s -> 375.45s]  we are gonna get started. Please do me a quick favor. I need to make sure that you guys can
[375.45s -> 390.98s]  click on the screen. So uh oh just realized something very important. It'll be tricky it's
[390.98s -> 398.18s]  gonna take a little finagling. I just realized that I can't can't can't. All right how do you
[398.18s -> 404.58s]  in Windows 10 how do you pin a window to not be minimized? Anybody know is there like a shortcut?
[405.78s -> 410.34s]  Because every time I click off the screen the window drops. Is there a way to just pin a window
[410.34s -> 418.98s]  so it never uh never it gets minimized? You have to do it in the task manager? All I have is close
[418.98s -> 429.51s]  window. Oh that's complicated. Is it? Make it windowed? It is windowed but I it's I have
[431.58s -> 437.22s]  it doesn't matter every time I minimize the window. You know every time I minimize the
[437.22s -> 442.18s]  window then no no no look I'll just show you in real time. I'll just show you in real time.
[442.18s -> 452.06s]  So for instance here is Diablo 2 right? But here's my cursor if I click off the window at all
[452.06s -> 456.79s]  bye bye here's my desktop. How do I do that? How do I keep that there? How do I keep it from doing
[456.79s -> 466.58s]  that? How do I keep it there? Pretty sick background I know. But to turn on click map
[466.58s -> 472.04s]  so I have to click out of the window. You know what I'm saying? There's got to be a way. What is
[472.04s -> 483.03s]  this background? All right we're not ready yet hold on. The boomer wallpaper? No it's a default
[483.03s -> 489.75s]  basic wallpaper sorry. All right where is it? I have to download a program? Do I have to download
[489.75s -> 493.75s]  more programs for this? I think it'll be fine. I just have to like make the window maximized again
[493.75s -> 499.43s]  when I turn on click maps. So anytime click maps turns on just wait like five seconds before you
[499.43s -> 514.30s]  click anything. I know that's asking a lot. It's an 800 by 600 boomer wallpaper. This isn't a joke
[514.30s -> 520.70s]  background. Do you know how hard it is to find? I got three monitors and it's hard it's kind of
[520.70s -> 525.02s]  hard to find one that doesn't hurt my eyes because you get it you get attacked from all angles.
[530.25s -> 536.74s]  Three just three monitors only three omega low. Only what do you mean only three? That's a ton.
[537.38s -> 543.62s]  Like I'm under attack from my right screen because it's just there. What do I need? Who needs more
[543.62s -> 550.33s]  than three monitors? What do you need it for? I'm not like watching tv on something. Maybe I mean
[550.33s -> 555.56s]  that'd be kind of fun actually. All right we're gonna test see if this works. Let me just see
[555.56s -> 560.44s]  what happens. Here is Diablo 2. Remember what happens if I die in hardcore? I die when you die
[560.76s -> 573.34s]  when you die you're dead. There it is. Okay so let me make sure the click maps works.
[573.90s -> 581.18s]  Otherwise that would be bad wouldn't it? Yeah you're gonna get the mountains every
[581.18s -> 585.02s]  every like every time there's a decision that needs to be made you're gonna get these beautiful
[585.02s -> 592.63s]  mountains. All right does click maps actually even work? It does. Well this is just a test.
[593.27s -> 607.43s]  Any people clicking? It's me on the right. Look at that it's pretty good actually.
[608.07s -> 615.40s]  You have scuffed maps. Well the reason why I have scuffed maps is because it's actually easier to
[615.96s -> 622.55s]  the bubbles to not run into each other. All right but this is not the this is not the choice. This
[622.55s -> 632.87s]  is just us hanging out for a second. Fire I want you to be fire be fire. Just so you guys know
[634.54s -> 639.02s]  I really am actually looking to you to not ruin this whole thing and I know you give I'm giving
[639.02s -> 645.18s]  this to thousands of people. So this is not this is not it. Hold on take a look at those mountains
[645.18s -> 655.74s]  for a second. This is and fine if you want to have a 200 strength source for that has a melee
[655.74s -> 663.82s]  for a move. I mean I'll try to work with it but just know if I kill the last boss with this shitty
[663.82s -> 670.55s]  character I think that I think I deserve something there. I think I deserve at least a little bit of
[670.55s -> 678.34s]  credit. Don't do melee it's shit. Well all right this is not up to me. Are you ready to pick the
[678.34s -> 683.70s]  class? Here we go. Pick the class. I'll go over them just in case people don't know. I mean Diablo
[683.70s -> 692.26s]  it's been a while. Diablo II is an old fucking game. Amazon. Bows. Spears. Ranged mostly. Javelins.
[693.14s -> 700.42s]  Assassin. Traps. Bombs. Martial arts. Mostly melee with a little bit of electricity involved.
[701.06s -> 706.82s]  Necromancer. The meme character. Diablo II if you don't know has this thing where you can have like
[706.82s -> 710.82s]  a hundred companions on the screen. This is the summoner. You can have like
[712.10s -> 718.84s]  85 fucking people running around with you. Okay cool. It kind of sucks though. So just let you know.
[718.84s -> 724.55s]  Barbarian. Melee. Very easy. Or you could put 20 points into potion. Potion find.
[725.53s -> 730.07s]  And that'll be completely useless. That sounds fun. Melee. Paladin.
[734.09s -> 738.74s]  That's all you need to know. That's all. That's literally it. Sorceress.
[739.80s -> 748.44s]  Magic. Casting. Bells. Fire. Lightning. Ice. And druid. Summoning. A little bit of summoning.
[749.00s -> 757.99s]  Also shapeshifting. Bears. Turning into a wolf. You guys know? You guys get your ideas? This is it.
[758.63s -> 763.58s]  Majority rules here. Whoever has the most percentage. And by the way if you click,
[763.58s -> 770.42s]  if you click on fire or exit your vote is useless. We're not doing it again. Don't start yet. I'll
[770.42s -> 780.47s]  tell you when. Look at those mountains. These mountains are fucking beautiful. Here we go.
[780.47s -> 812.90s]  I don't know. Use window capture? That doesn't work. Okay. That seems like a lot of people
[812.90s -> 822.63s]  want to do Necromancer. You're on an old version of Diablo. I'm on 1.14d and I have the glide
[822.63s -> 826.95s]  wrapper installed. I shouldn't be doing this but it is. And there's not much I can do about it
[826.95s -> 839.35s]  at the moment. All right. Looks like we're doing Necromancer. Which I'll work with it.
[840.74s -> 850.55s]  Wait. Why do you guys want to do this? You really want to do this? This is going to be so,
[850.55s -> 854.87s]  this is going to be the most boring playthrough ever. I'm not going to. All right. This is also
[854.87s -> 858.47s]  important. No. We're doing another vote. We're doing. No. No. Are we? I don't. Okay. Listen.
[858.47s -> 865.59s]  Listen. Listen. Important. I won't. I can't kill bosses. I know what you're going to do.
[865.59s -> 868.07s]  I know exactly. I know what you guys are going to do. I can't kill bosses.
[868.63s -> 875.38s]  It's literally this will be unbeatable. I'm going to have to hit the bosses with like a wand.
[875.70s -> 883.61s]  Or a stick. Like six or seven hundred times. And run back into a portal. All right. Fine. Fine.
[883.61s -> 894.07s]  Fine. Fine. God damn it. Fine. All right. Let's go. Veto it. Veto it. I can't. Why did I say that
[894.07s -> 899.03s]  in the beginning? By the way, this is the worst thing you could do. Actually it's not. So you
[899.03s -> 906.98s]  just got baited. Congratulations guys. Yep. Let's go. Check out those mountains for a sec.
[910.28s -> 915.88s]  Okay. Barbarian actually would be the worst thing in the world if you did Barbarian potion
[915.88s -> 920.76s]  finding. I literally don't want to have moves. Or a melee sorceress with like eight hundred
[920.76s -> 934.94s]  strength. Completely worthless. I can work with this. Maybe I should pick the stats because
[934.94s -> 942.71s]  otherwise this is going to be fucking impossible. No. Not Sans. Of course somebody's going to say
[942.71s -> 950.60s]  Sans. Unbelievable. I am actually fucking mad about that. I am actually upset about this. Tommy
[950.60s -> 968.89s]  Pickles? How about Tommy Pickles? Makes no sense. Tommy Pickles does not make any sense.
[974.34s -> 991.45s]  Chucky? Chucky the Necromancer? Okay. I like that. Here we go. Diablo II hardcore
[991.45s -> 998.84s]  as a Necromancer. Good luck. No. Too late. It's a bad name. It's too late. You guys. This guy's
[998.84s -> 1014.46s]  going to last five minutes. It's a bad name. And okay. Chucky's a bad name but Sans is a good name.
[1015.02s -> 1040.04s]  Tommy Lee Bones. Sans. Tommy Lee Bones. That's very elaborate. I like Tommy Lee Bones.
[1043.72s -> 1050.50s]  And it fits. Tommy Lee Bones. Warning. Once a hardcore character dies it cannot be played
[1050.50s -> 1057.22s]  again. Are you sure you wish to make a hardcore character? Yes. Here we go. Good day. You guys
[1057.22s -> 1065.83s]  hear it? Greetings stranger. I'm not surprised to see your kind here. Many adventurers have traveled
[1065.83s -> 1070.98s]  this way since the recent troubles began. No doubt you've heard about the tragedy that
[1070.98s -> 1074.42s]  befell the town of Tristram. Just look at these mountains for a second. Some say the Diablo
[1075.80s -> 1084.55s]  walks the world again. I don't know if I believe that but I did travel this route a few weeks ago.
[1084.55s -> 1090.63s]  It was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the rogue monastery. Maybe it's nothing but
[1090.63s -> 1094.47s]  evil seems to have trailed in his wake. I didn't skip anything. You'll see shortly after the
[1094.47s -> 1097.67s]  wanderer went through. As everybody knows the fucking story, do we really have to do this?
[1098.79s -> 1104.07s]  And strange creatures began ravaging the countryside. Until it's safer outside the
[1104.07s -> 1109.02s]  camp and the gates are reopened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Loot
[1109.02s -> 1115.42s]  Ghulain before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all. If you're still alive then I'll
[1115.42s -> 1121.82s]  take you along. Mute the game audio. You've never played Diablo 2 ever? Holy shit. You're in for a
[1121.82s -> 1132.17s]  tramy. She can tell you more. Okay so I'm a necromancer. We don't need the help on there.
[1132.17s -> 1137.93s]  I already know how to play the game. Right now as you can see I've got my inventory. I've got a wand
[1138.73s -> 1144.17s]  which is plus one to raise skeletons so I can have a skeleton. None of this matters. I'm dead in
[1144.17s -> 1148.57s]  fucking five minutes. Like this I'm gonna lose. No I get rid of the wand. What do you mean get rid
[1148.57s -> 1156.78s]  of the fucking wand? What are you talking about? Why would I get rid of the wand? See this is why
[1156.78s -> 1162.06s]  I'm so glad I have you have nothing to do with the items I can equip. Here's your stash. I'm so I
[1162.06s -> 1170.25s]  can't wait. I love this game so much. Just like you played D3. Drop wand. I know I can't. I do
[1170.25s -> 1176.78s]  have to do this though. So you uh reanimate a skeletal warrior from a target corpse. If something
[1176.78s -> 1180.70s]  dies you can bring it back to life as a skeleton. Right now I have one total skeleton. It'll have
[1180.70s -> 1192.02s]  20 health. 2020. One to two damage. Drop the wand. Chat picks everything. To an extent though.
[1192.02s -> 1202.58s]  No I'm not dropping the fucking wand. I'm not dropping the wand. I can't summon. I can't.
[1203.70s -> 1207.94s]  What are you talking about? You can't punch things. The necromancer and the level one.
[1213.46s -> 1215.62s]  Cain's title. No that's true.
[1220.58s -> 1224.50s]  Drop it. I'm not dropping. I'm not dropping the wand. You're not going to convince me.
[1225.46s -> 1229.78s]  No this is hardcore man. I don't want to die to corpse pyre. If I die to corpse pyre then I'm
[1229.78s -> 1234.82s]  not going to stream for a week. Like I'll just turn the stream off. I'll get out of here. No way.
[1234.82s -> 1235.78s]  Like that's too embarrassing.
[1242.82s -> 1250.26s]  I implore you stranger please help us find a way to lift this terrible curse on this town.
[1251.06s -> 1255.54s]  There is a place of great evil. There is a place of great evil in the wilderness.
[1256.34s -> 1263.22s]  Kasha's rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures
[1263.22s -> 1267.78s]  and horrors from beyond the grave. Predicted it. Yeah I've only done what you're seeing right now.
[1268.58s -> 1271.70s]  Probably realistically five to six hundred times.
[1272.26s -> 1279.22s]  If you are sincere about helping us you can find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts.
[1280.18s -> 1285.30s]  Be the great eye watch over you. All right so Diablo 2 works like this. You get six quests in
[1285.30s -> 1292.66s]  each zone. There are one two three four five zones. That's six no just five. He doesn't even know his
[1292.66s -> 1296.26s]  own game. So the six quests in every zone. This is the first one. Look for the den in the wilderness
[1296.26s -> 1299.22s]  outside the rogue's camp. We're going to change a couple things just to make sure
[1299.22s -> 1303.06s]  because I don't like that. I don't like that at all. We're going to go into the options. We're
[1303.06s -> 1308.90s]  going to go into the mini map controls. We're doing the small map. I'm going to fade everything.
[1308.90s -> 1313.37s]  So then we just keep it on the screen there in the top left. Now we got a mini map.
[1314.17s -> 1317.77s]  You click to move in this game which is interesting. Click to move in this game.
[1319.13s -> 1327.93s]  All right let's go. Let us pick the options. Options. We're going to find the den of evil
[1327.93s -> 1338.06s]  guys. Are you ready? Beware. I'm so ready. Pre-recorded stream. That would be funny.
[1338.94s -> 1343.42s]  Go get a stone of Jordan. Just wait till you see the drops in this game.
[1344.94s -> 1348.70s]  I'm so nervous. I can't like walk around. So I got posters down here obviously. You click on
[1348.70s -> 1357.10s]  things to attack. We got one skeleton. This held us up there. Actually I actually don't mind this.
[1358.06s -> 1372.25s]  Hold alt to see everything. Turn the game down. Is it loud now? How's that? Better? Is that a
[1372.25s -> 1380.54s]  little more bearable? All right looking for the bloodmore. Now we're in the bloodmore.
[1387.62s -> 1398.54s]  Your video buffered. We're talking about buffered. It's Goldilocks too much. The game works just like
[1398.54s -> 1404.62s]  I don't know why. Why do I feel like I need to describe Diablo to you guys? It's every single
[1404.62s -> 1418.06s]  human. Even those that don't play video games know this game. Every human. I literally don't.
[1418.06s -> 1422.22s]  Do I need to explain Diablo too? Do I? All right here we go. You guys are going to have some
[1422.22s -> 1428.87s]  choices here and you're gonna have to pick. That's the ultimate rumor. That's an air rumor.
[1429.43s -> 1438.31s]  That's a fucking that's flying like over the house. That's okay. We're good. The way that
[1438.31s -> 1441.83s]  skills work in Diablo is every time you level up you get a skill point. Each one of these can have
[1441.83s -> 1450.71s]  up to 20 points each. Summoning spells. Poison and bone. Curses. As you can see. You have a lot of
[1450.71s -> 1460.02s]  choices. Each one of these can hold 20 points. If I were you. If I was watching this stream right
[1460.02s -> 1469.42s]  now I would go open up a Diablo 2 skill calculator. Find out what you'd like to pick. You can't you
[1469.42s -> 1473.90s]  know you can't choose. If you guys choose nothing. If all of you guys click on like the the X.
[1475.53s -> 1489.19s]  Then I get to choose. Run on 3D audio. I can't turn that. That feature like doesn't exist anymore.
[1490.23s -> 1501.46s]  All right I need some items. We're gonna find the little cave. We're looking for a little cave.
[1501.46s -> 1507.06s]  It's a little and by the way I'm gonna level up soon. You guys will have an opportunity to fucking
[1507.06s -> 1515.21s]  me. It's all right. Imagine min maxing every playthrough lol. Yeah it's Diablo man. You gotta
[1515.21s -> 1521.72s]  be careful. He's listening to the he's listening to this in 2D.
[1529.58s -> 1533.66s]  I can't fucking believe this is not gonna work. You know how many times I've tried
[1533.66s -> 1539.90s]  to do okay you can only play as a summoning necromancer if you have like four friends to carry
[1539.90s -> 1550.23s]  you. Oh shit. Look at that. You wanna see? Show all items. Show all items. All right look.
[1551.46s -> 1554.90s]  Low quality leather armor. That's a fucking pogchamp right there. I've never seen one.
[1556.23s -> 1558.79s]  There's your belt. Your belt can only hold four potions at the moment.
[1559.59s -> 1564.97s]  And these potions are not instant. You have to eventually end up spamming these.
[1569.02s -> 1575.50s]  This is the first ding. All right guys. Let me get to. Here's the thing. I can't just like stand still
[1575.50s -> 1582.74s]  because this is hardcore. I'll die. Just wait a minute. We'll do this. Give me a second. All
[1582.74s -> 1594.14s]  right. Is this safe? Is it safe? I think. Okay. We'll do the skill point first. So the first thing
[1594.14s -> 1601.53s]  you need to do is you have to pick a category. So it's gonna be category first. Okay. Once you
[1601.53s -> 1608.36s]  pick that category don't select anything. You're picking a category first. Is this uh yeah this is
[1608.36s -> 1615.02s]  LOD. Don't touch anything. I'm gonna show you the focus of mountains for a second. Okay please
[1615.02s -> 1636.95s]  choose a category. Right. I click this one. I choose skeleton. I like skeleton. He looks cool.
[1641.03s -> 1645.99s]  All right. Point number one is gonna go into summoning spells. It just is. It's too much.
[1645.99s -> 1652.86s]  All right. I'm gonna show you a cool fucking mountain for a second. Okay. Where do you want
[1652.86s -> 1664.81s]  me to put the point? There's only one place it can go. You can only put it. There's only one place
[1664.81s -> 1673.18s]  it can go. I can't touch this yet. Gee. I fucking wonder where it's gonna go guys.
[1680.41s -> 1693.18s]  Well. Okay. I wanted to raise skeleton. Now I got two. Pretty cool. All right. Now.
[1694.62s -> 1699.82s]  Dude. I gotta figure out how to keep this fucking thing. All right. The stat points thing. This is
[1699.82s -> 1717.18s]  gonna be hard because this is so important. Like it's so important. If there's somebody watching
[1717.18s -> 1720.86s]  right now that's played this game and I know this is probably up high in the categories on Twitch
[1720.86s -> 1726.14s]  right now. You're about to see something that's gonna make you fucking just curl up into your
[1726.14s -> 1732.63s]  chair and I know and I can't fix it. Nothing I can do about it. By the way this is for all five
[1732.63s -> 1738.36s]  points. We're not gonna sit here and do each individual point. One at a time. This stream
[1738.36s -> 1744.76s]  isn't gonna be all day. The stream is never gonna turn off. Every single point has to be voted on
[1744.76s -> 1758.20s]  but what about the mountains? All right. This is for two at a time. Two at a time. Two points at
[1758.20s -> 1771.66s]  a time. Where's it going? I'm not even sure it's it's far away enough. Make sure you're clicking on
[1771.66s -> 1779.80s]  the right spot. Thank you. It might be too far away. I might just have to. I might have to decide
[1779.80s -> 1789.43s]  these. I might have to decide these is too. Wait. Hold on. Mountain. Wait. Zoom it in. I got no.
[1789.43s -> 1796.15s]  Hold on. I gotta like. Zooming in this guy. Look at those mountains. Hold on. I can't zoom in. I
[1796.15s -> 1803.48s]  can't zoom in this. I can't. All five. This is for all five points. Do not do an
[1803.48s -> 1810.79s]  individual mountain voting. No. Just okay. I'm gonna take a screenshot and I'm gonna zoom the
[1810.79s -> 1821.30s]  fuck in. That's a good idea. All right. Screenshot. Print screen. I didn't think this one. All right.
[1821.30s -> 1830.79s]  I got a print screen. Take a look at those mountains. All right. Hold on. Give me one second.
[1830.79s -> 1835.99s]  Give me one second. Give me give me give me one second. So this will be this will be much easier.
[1836.63s -> 1843.86s]  In fact, yeah, this is going to be so much easier. It becomes the longest stream of 2020 or the
[1843.86s -> 1853.35s]  shortest one. I'm not sure yet. We'll find out eventually. Okay. Hold on one sec.
[1854.47s -> 1869.06s]  Hey, you guys will be able to see them both. That. Okay. I just wish I could keep the window up. I
[1869.06s -> 1875.16s]  don't know why it's doing that. I have it in windowed mode. I cannot play this game online.
[1875.16s -> 1889.93s]  My account is banned for no I for no reason. I didn't fucking do anything. All right. Let's save
[1889.93s -> 1901.80s]  this. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. All right. Here we go. So now I can just do this. This would be much
[1901.80s -> 1906.52s]  easier. Do I do this for each individual skill tree too? So we could just go bang bang. I got a
[1906.52s -> 1911.00s]  good idea. Hold on. Okay. I got a good idea. This is gonna be a good idea. No, don't do that.
[1911.88s -> 1915.74s]  No, that's a good idea. I mean, this is the fucking window. Shit's gonna be all over the place.
[1915.74s -> 1918.54s]  All right. Just get, you know, here like the stream hadn't even started yet. Just fucking hold
[1918.54s -> 2036.60s]  on. I'll be right back. All right. I believe I'm ready to start doing this. Okay. For a second,
[2036.60s -> 2041.46s]  I just had a panic attack because I realized that this is this has been minimized the whole
[2041.46s -> 2051.34s]  fucking time and I I've just been like I could be dead right now. Okay. Hold on. That just like
[2051.34s -> 2058.02s]  scared the shit out of me. All right. Let me just get these loaded up. All right. Just hold on a
[2058.02s -> 2062.34s]  second. The stream's starting to just a minute. Pick which way you want five points to go. Go for
[2062.34s -> 2090.97s]  it. Nice JPGE. Yeah, I know. I know. Trust me. Strength. Okay. Of course. We did it. Hooray.
[2092.09s -> 2097.85s]  This will, once we work the kinks out, this is gonna be a lot of fun. Well, good for you guys,
[2097.85s -> 2110.04s]  I guess. All right. Okay. Five points in strength. Pay no attention to these.
[2110.92s -> 2123.56s]  I'm just getting them ready. Don't click on any of these yet. Don't pay any attention to these.
[2124.55s -> 2135.43s]  These are just putting my my getting my pages ready. Mountains? No, we're gonna we're trying
[2135.43s -> 2158.42s]  to minimize the amount of mountains we have to have. Put that on there. I know it's gonna be all
[2158.42s -> 2189.58s]  stretched out, but you have to just it's gonna be easier for you to click. Sounds good. Everything
[2189.58s -> 2198.79s]  should be good to go, right? Now, very important. Okay. Sorry, guys. I didn't realize this is gonna
[2198.79s -> 2207.69s]  be as much as a pain in the ass as this actually is. All because I can't fucking get off my
[2208.09s -> 2219.53s]  minimization. Don't get mad. I'm good. This is called this is this is poison and bone.
[2220.25s -> 2240.54s]  Which one is this one? This is versus. Okay. What the fuck is this one? I promise we'll actually
[2240.54s -> 2250.86s]  do something in a minute. Blame Blizzard for literally not giving a shit about the games
[2250.86s -> 2258.55s]  they made 15 years ago, unless they can resell them for $40. Oh, hey, we had some community
[2258.55s -> 2267.30s]  subs. We had 20 community subs from Zap X. Z half X. And hold on. Wait, hold on. A bunch of money
[2267.30s -> 2277.43s]  came in. Thanks for the 20 subs. Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars from AB Joe. Give me one moment.
[2277.43s -> 2283.38s]  Well, I gotta get this stuff going. Kind of against the clock here trying to get this to work.
[2284.02s -> 2294.44s]  All right. Now I just have to add it to the stream deck. Okay. This is it. We're just like,
[2294.44s -> 2303.66s]  just look at the screen for a minute. Blizzard. Fuck your old games unless you can 15 years later
[2303.66s -> 2326.86s]  sell them for $50. I'm gonna call this one bone right now. I wonder how many sad people buy because
[2326.86s -> 2334.36s]  they sell it on on battle.net. They sell this shit on battle.net. I wonder how many disappointed
[2334.36s -> 2338.52s]  people go to buy this and then go, wow, this is fucking like not even remotely close to being what
[2338.52s -> 2349.98s]  it should be in 2020. All right. There's the bone. This is all for a purpose. Trust me. I promise.
[2350.70s -> 2373.13s]  It's a curse. Uh huh. Last one. I promise. Summon. Here we go. Imagine there having to be third
[2373.13s -> 2379.82s]  party mods to have the game run in a fucking window correctly. Blizzard entertainment.
[2380.78s -> 2392.14s]  Tis ain't the same, is it? And summon. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm actually ready
[2392.14s -> 2414.22s]  to fucking do this. If I'm dead, I'm gonna fucking be so bad. All right. We finally crossed the
[2414.22s -> 2420.86s]  threshold where I can do this. Sorry for the 500 people that left. Blame Blizzard. Always.
[2421.66s -> 2451.08s]  Here we go. I'll be shocked if I get past fucking Act 1. How have I not found the Den of Evil yet?
[2455.22s -> 2471.48s]  I'm gonna blame the dumb idiot streamer. You could. You could, but don't. Holy shit. Everyone
[2471.48s -> 2482.79s]  came back. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What? Hold on. Like 700 people left and they all just came back
[2482.79s -> 2491.62s]  instantly. Like they all came back at the same time. They were all just like, all right,
[2491.62s -> 2499.82s]  I'll come back in like 20 minutes. I'll get this shit figured out. Hey, what's going on guys?
[2502.62s -> 2505.58s]  Not a big deal. Don't worry. Everything's good to go. We are. I got two skeletons.
[2506.14s -> 2512.46s]  I'm gonna have to use a sword. Where's the Den of Evil? It never takes me this long. I've played
[2512.46s -> 2531.43s]  this game 2,000 times. Where's the Den of Evil? Wait, do I have a stamina? I'm already, I already
[2531.43s -> 2536.55s]  had a stamina. I didn't lose already. Your health has to go to zero to lose. Give me vitality next
[2536.55s -> 2560.33s]  time, please guys. For the love of God. No. Use the bow. I don't have any arrows. This is the
[2560.33s -> 2564.49s]  longest I think it's ever. This is the type of RNG you get where if I was speed running this game,
[2564.49s -> 2575.99s]  I would just smash my fingers on the desk and then quit. What is it? A car door? Yeah,
[2575.99s -> 2592.07s]  I smashed my fingers at my car door on my desk. Ah, there it is. Help. Damn it. Why aren't you
[2592.07s -> 2600.57s]  saying it? Help. Help me. Help me. Help. Help. Help me. Got it. All right. We have to kill every
[2600.57s -> 2605.05s]  single monster in Den of Evil. Oh God. No, I died. Within this place. That's good.
[2605.77s -> 2621.37s]  I think I got my two skeletons there. I got a dagger. Field? No, pet build would be.
[2622.17s -> 2625.85s]  I can't believe we're actually doing this. This is actually bullshit. This is gonna be so bad.
[2627.61s -> 2640.26s]  All right. Hold on. What did I get? Ooh, two sockets. Yeah. Yeah. One to three. Good for. No.
[2642.38s -> 2645.74s]  You're a summoner in hardcore by myself.
[2648.22s -> 2652.14s]  This early in the game, I mean, you get carried as a summoner to late game.
[2654.54s -> 2659.26s]  I'm not gonna be able to beat the first one. I'm actually kind of glad you guys are doing the
[2659.26s -> 2663.66s]  main and putting points into strength because I'm gonna have to hit the fucking first possible
[2663.66s -> 2674.54s]  wouldn't stick until the end. All right. Do I have any? I'm actually paranoid.
[2675.26s -> 2682.90s]  It's so loud too. Why is this so loud? Come on.
[2689.99s -> 2696.87s]  Amulet. I just let you guys know the way it's white is the lowest quality. Actually,
[2696.87s -> 2704.31s]  gray could be technically damaged. Blue is magic to standard. Yellow is rare. And then gold is
[2704.95s -> 2710.06s]  unique. Not legendary. You could call it legendary if you want. I know we leveled up. Just hold on.
[2710.06s -> 2715.50s]  We know how Diablo work, but I do you. I got like 10 people that's fucking 5,000 people here.
[2716.62s -> 2720.30s]  Yeah. Look it up. Just look up Diablo 2 rules and there's like a whole list. You can read them.
[2722.14s -> 2731.13s]  Be careful. There's a little mini boss in here. I got to heal.
[2736.86s -> 2745.45s]  Diablo 2 rules. It's great. Yeah. All right. You got to kill. Where's the shaman?
[2749.59s -> 2753.11s]  And you have to identify shit in this game. Actually, let's identify this. Hey,
[2753.19s -> 2756.95s]  plus two to strength. That's you guys are doing that already. Might as well just keep it going.
[2757.75s -> 2773.37s]  Is there even any skills that the necromancer has? Two to seven. I lose a skeleton though.
[2774.26s -> 2781.75s]  No, not worth it. I'm too scared to lose another skeleton. All right. Time to level up. So
[2782.55s -> 2790.90s]  here we go. Where are we going? Actually, I'm going to do it like this.
[2791.78s -> 2801.99s]  So you guys don't have to end up. You guys never have to see the mountains again.
[2803.11s -> 2808.81s]  I don't want you guys have to see the mountains again. All right. What are we doing?
[2809.94s -> 2824.50s]  That's first. Thank God. The mountains are the best bit of a stream. No, I don't. That's like
[2824.50s -> 2827.70s]  jarring. Are we actually going to put points into vitality for the love of God?
[2829.90s -> 2842.33s]  Thank you. Seriously. Thank you. You're not going to regret this. All right. Thank you. No energy.
[2842.33s -> 2850.50s]  Well, that's not that important right now. Very cool. Thanks guys. Back to it. Here we go.
[2852.01s -> 2864.09s]  So, um, yes, good work. All right. Now for the skill, the skill point where what, first of all,
[2864.09s -> 2875.53s]  you got to, maybe you got to pick a category. So why is this all fucked up? Hold on a second.
[2875.53s -> 2885.80s]  Should be spread across the whole thing. No, what? Lock this in place for the love of God.
[2886.86s -> 2889.98s]  I don't want you to see the goddamn mountains. I don't want you to see the mountains.
[2897.70s -> 2914.81s]  Okay. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. All right. I know this is real
[2914.81s -> 2928.63s]  ugly. You ready? Where are we going? Why is it doing this? Stop doing. Oh my God. I hate Blizzard.
[2929.35s -> 2951.93s]  He said it. Oh my God. He said it. He said it in this very moment. What is happening? Why is this?
[2951.93s -> 2957.05s]  What do you, am I going crazy? Okay. Am I going crazy? Why does this keep doing this?
[2966.10s -> 2982.39s]  Okay. Fucking Blizzard entertainment. Can you believe it? Where are we going? Why can I not
[2982.39s -> 2996.38s]  see this? I didn't spend the point. All right. We're going summoning. Good. Now where? Now what
[2996.38s -> 3008.09s]  do you want me to do? It only took an hour. And then for me to say that I hate Blizzard for this
[3008.09s -> 3021.67s]  to work. We can only go, all right. We can't even go anywhere for this. I can show you what these
[3021.67s -> 3033.72s]  things do if you want. All right. Three skeletons. Let's go.
[3062.02s -> 3071.80s]  Skeleton squad moving on. How many, how many more we have?
[3071.80s -> 3088.66s]  Funny. Am I allowed to click on shrines? Yes. All right. So at three points,
[3089.30s -> 3091.94s]  he's still the same amount of health. Better attack and defense. So that's good.
[3091.94s -> 3107.53s]  I feel like we're going to walk into a fire and I should hopefully get some good items.
[3110.12s -> 3123.61s]  Players at eight. Players at eight. Did I do that? Players, how about players?
[3125.13s -> 3132.30s]  No, that's, I'm going to die. That's like the quickest way for me to get destroyed. Four.
[3133.10s -> 3137.43s]  That's cheating. That's reverse cheating. That's seven times the difficulty.
[3138.23s -> 3141.59s]  You're going to get more experience. All right. No, no. All right. We'll do four.
[3144.52s -> 3154.86s]  Players set to four. That's more experience. What if I die though? All right. I might,
[3154.86s -> 3160.94s]  I might revert this. I'm kind of scared about this. How many, what if I, how many? Okay. It hurts.
[3162.22s -> 3172.55s]  It's power leveling. Lakers set to four. Yeah. It's simulating four people in the game.
[3173.43s -> 3177.50s]  There he is. There he is. There he is. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't,
[3177.50s -> 3185.30s]  don't fuck this up. You guys get in there and you, that's corpse fire. He's fucking scary.
[3186.26s -> 3189.98s]  He has electricity. He, he, he just fucking one hit killed that guy.
[3191.26s -> 3207.32s]  He explodes when he dies and it's going to kill me. I'm, I'm going to, it's going to kill me.
[3207.32s -> 3210.36s]  It's going to kill me. I'm already panicking for no reason. How much health does he have?
[3211.24s -> 3227.37s]  All right. Get him. Get him. You have the AFK build on. I, this is actually not that big of a
[3227.37s -> 3236.68s]  deal. He's going to watch this. Ready? Watch all three of these. Wait, does he not have that move?
[3236.76s -> 3242.28s]  Oh shit. He doesn't have that move in normal. Okay. Well, we're fine. Level up again.
[3245.66s -> 3250.71s]  There is one more monster left. What are you doing? Skeletons are you doing? You're going
[3250.71s -> 3269.98s]  off on skeletons here. Where's this last one? That's what we got a ha ha copy pasta. Oh,
[3271.82s -> 3289.94s]  well cut it out. You're a monster. They're an underrated type of, I've never seen this before.
[3290.58s -> 3295.37s]  I've got a bunch of dog shit we got to throw away. I'm going to kill one more monster. We're going
[3295.37s -> 3311.70s]  to, we're going to get this down so I can actually, I swear to God, people only call my phone when the
[3311.70s -> 3318.66s]  stream is turned off. Nobody fucking calls me at any second of the day, unless it's, I'm live.
[3321.53s -> 3331.42s]  All right. Where's this last monster? They're trying to network with you.
[3332.14s -> 3341.26s]  Why would you do? No, not like when I'm, not when I'm working. You stream for eight hours though.
[3341.26s -> 3344.94s]  Yeah. But I start the stream around the same time, like between like, you know, two in the
[3344.94s -> 3349.66s]  afternoon, three in the afternoon, four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon. Sometimes one
[3349.66s -> 3357.88s]  in the afternoon. You know, it's a big window. You're right. I got to find this last monster.
[3357.88s -> 3373.13s]  Where's this? Oh, wait. Get all this gold. I got fucking banned from battling that. Like I'm, I'm
[3373.13s -> 3376.25s]  not happy with Blizzard at the moment. I'm like actually annoyed by this.
[3381.34s -> 3392.58s]  Press completed. I didn't do anything. Greetings. You have cleansed the den of evil.
[3392.58s -> 3396.58s]  So if we're doing the den of evil, we get a skill point. You've earned my trust and may yet
[3396.58s -> 3402.55s]  restore my faith and humanity. What is training in the skill of your choice? Thank you.
[3403.83s -> 3408.87s]  All right. So, uh, again, we're, uh, we're, where would you guys like to go?
[3408.87s -> 3413.51s]  That's so ugly, but it has to be like this. I don't, I refuse to show you the mountains.
[3413.51s -> 3434.09s]  Where we go? Okay. Summoning. We got 2000 clicks already. Show the available skill pass. Yeah,
[3434.09s -> 3440.58s]  I'll do that too. I think I know where everyone wants to go. I want to go to summoning. Very cool.
[3441.46s -> 3452.98s]  So from here, uh, I wonder what you want to do. Uh, yeah. So we're going to put it in skeleton
[3452.98s -> 3465.93s]  build. Fucking dumb ass boring chat. I didn't say that. Oh yeah. Skeletons.
[3467.69s -> 3471.77s]  It's all right. It's okay. We're going to be good. All right. We're going to put it into skeletons.
[3473.82s -> 3481.34s]  Let's take a look at what these points actually do first. So, uh, as you can see here are the
[3481.34s -> 3487.93s]  paths. So you probably should have seen that first. Okay. Let's actually, let's go over this first.
[3488.65s -> 3494.31s]  Let's go over this first. We've opened up some stuff. All right. So you
[3496.09s -> 3504.55s]  spray listed. We're going to do it again. Ray skeleton skeleton mastery is what you can do as
[3504.55s -> 3510.97s]  well. Cause this path has gone over this way. Uh, it's a passive increases the life and damage of
[3510.97s -> 3520.01s]  Ray skeletons. So you just make them better, more better, more better at level 12. We can go down
[3520.01s -> 3527.38s]  to skeleton mage at level six. We can do clay gone more better poison and bone. What is available is
[3527.38s -> 3532.66s]  bone armor, which is just a shield of bone that absorbs and shit. It's pretty good. It absorbs 20
[3532.66s -> 3540.95s]  damage. As you see, I have 59 health, which that's pretty great actually teeth, which I can explain
[3540.95s -> 3546.71s]  as just, it goes around, around, around, around, around, around. That's all. That's seriously what
[3546.71s -> 3551.91s]  it is. There's no other way for me to describe this. Uh, it's just a damaging spell. It shoots
[3551.99s -> 3560.25s]  little, uh, little goo balls out curses. Uh, necromancer can cast curses on people that do
[3560.25s -> 3565.21s]  various things like for instance, uh, amplify damage increases the, uh, physical damage that
[3565.21s -> 3571.05s]  they take. They take a hundred percent more damage from all physical attacks. Number 20 points can
[3571.05s -> 3577.29s]  go into all of these. The reason why I'm doing this is because you see the screenshots we have
[3578.17s -> 3583.11s]  and I have to remember, uh, we'll go over it before we do it, obviously, but for instance, curses,
[3584.07s -> 3588.23s]  like that's what we have available, but it's going to be grayed out, but you see the path,
[3588.23s -> 3594.28s]  right? All right. So with that knowledge and knowing what we can do, we'll do another,
[3594.28s -> 3603.14s]  we'll do one more. Here we go. It's, it's race. It was race. Okay. Now we have another,
[3603.14s -> 3619.29s]  we have another point. Where's it going? It's not like a category. You got to pick a category for
[3619.29s -> 3623.93s]  all right. Okay. Does it count if you pick the category and then you pick the skeletons?
[3624.89s -> 3639.37s]  You're already just going to skeleton. It's already been decided. Like I can't even,
[3639.37s -> 3646.38s]  it's just going to the skeleton. It's supposed to be category first and that's just not it. All
[3646.38s -> 3665.51s]  right. Okay. We're making a huge minus two joke. I'm not me. Uh, by the way, we still only have
[3665.51s -> 3703.29s]  four skeletons, three skeletons, six stats, five points. Why am I so boring? What? Whatever.
[3703.29s -> 3711.93s]  Whatever you say. All right. We're going vitality. Thanks for vitality. Appreciate it.
[3716.86s -> 3729.96s]  Thanks for the vitality. Stupid chat. It's stupid over what the stats do. I will.
[3729.96s -> 3741.16s]  That's not a bad idea. Strength is just melee damage and able to wear heavy armor. You can wear
[3741.16s -> 3747.10s]  heavier shit. Dexterity is attack rating, which is how often you will hit something and your
[3747.10s -> 3753.96s]  defense rating. So, I mean, kind of useless for a necromancer. Vitality is health and stamina.
[3753.96s -> 3757.56s]  Stamina becomes absolutely useless. It doesn't matter anymore after like 50 points
[3758.44s -> 3776.22s]  and energy is mana. So this is health and mana. Kill NPCs. Stop going around like slashing.
[3777.34s -> 3789.99s]  All right. Let's keep going. I need to do this. Let's sell some stuff. Kill NPCs. All right. I
[3789.99s -> 3795.03s]  got to let's identify this brain. It's pretty pogchamp right there. Pretty cool. I can't use
[3795.03s -> 3802.95s]  this. This is a sorceress only. I need to get a book too. What do I have? 90? Oh, I'm not going
[3802.95s -> 3818.18s]  to use a bow. I got to, I have to identify, I got to identify this shit. You can reset your skills
[3818.18s -> 3825.32s]  once per difficulty, right? Is that correct? I don't have enough. Was it 360? What?
[3825.32s -> 3838.82s]  What? 350 or 360? 360. I want to identify this because it'll be worth more.
[3840.58s -> 3846.10s]  How the fuck do I not have to bring your 60? All right. There we go. Now I can sell this for 840.
[3846.10s -> 3851.78s]  You have to identify every single magic item. Now we got money. Town portal scrolls. This book allows
[3851.78s -> 3856.71s]  you to travel back and forth from town. It's pretty useful. It's pretty good shit. Don't get
[3856.71s -> 3863.21s]  the identified book. Kane does it for free. Well, I needed, Kane's not here yet. Not in town.
[3864.01s -> 3879.59s]  I'm doing this with money. All right. We're looking good. Intend you. Let's do players,
[3880.95s -> 3890.04s]  players six. I'm going hard. Yeah, we don't have Kane yet. We get Kane later.
[3895.10s -> 3901.64s]  All right. So the next quest after completing this, which will be completed, we have one here.
[3904.04s -> 3908.60s]  Everybody skipped this. I know you're here to challenge the evil that's driven us from our
[3908.92s -> 3914.04s]  ancestral house. My rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the monastery graveyard.
[3914.68s -> 3920.84s]  Apparently, you support Satan and worship him on screen. Blood Raven, one of our finest captains
[3920.84s -> 3927.40s]  in the battle against Diablo at Tristram. Here comes 30 minutes slow mode. Now you'll find her
[3927.40s -> 3933.16s]  in the monastery graveyard, raising our dead as zombies. We gotta go get Blood Raven.
[3933.16s -> 3937.80s]  Defilement. 30 minutes slow mode. You want another reason to leave
[3941.11s -> 3945.83s]  at a player when you add a skeleton. All right. So we're going to go out.
[3950.52s -> 3953.88s]  How far? How close was the dinner people? I think it was pretty far away.
[3954.76s -> 3960.28s]  30 minute bone mode. I can't have four skeletons. You guys need to read up on the lore. Look,
[3961.00s -> 3965.21s]  it's fun. I can't believe there's five points in Ray's skeleton right now. Okay. The next point
[3965.21s -> 3969.61s]  in Ray's skeleton, we'll get a fourth skeleton and they're just going to die because they're weak.
[3969.61s -> 3995.34s]  They're fucking worthless. He hates them. Skeletons are cool. That can be pretty cool. All right. So
[3995.34s -> 3998.54s]  how far away were we? Where I get it? Let's get a good indicator. So we got to go to the coal
[3998.54s -> 4003.78s]  plains with the Blood Raven in the burial grounds next to the coal plains. In the world of Diablo
[4003.78s -> 4008.98s]  two, every single thing is connected to itself. So a lot more is connected to the coal plains,
[4008.98s -> 4012.34s]  which is connected to the stony field, which is connected to the passage to go to the dark wood,
[4012.34s -> 4018.98s]  which is connected. Everything is in a row and everything is sort of, kind of, sort of randomly
[4018.98s -> 4027.53s]  generated. Beware. The evil is strong ahead. It's like seven different patterns. All right.
[4027.53s -> 4034.06s]  We got a waypoint. First waypoint of the game. I can't believe it's taking an hour to do this.
[4034.70s -> 4039.18s]  Fuck. God damn it. Hey, stamina shrine. That means I can run forever. All right. How many
[4039.18s -> 4044.94s]  plays are it? Okay. Be careful. I have a hard time. This might be too hard.
[4045.98s -> 4064.55s]  Oh, chip emerald. Armor plus three dexterity. Okay. Let's go drop it. It's a bad item.
[4065.11s -> 4076.81s]  I'm just going to use it. Bad. They're taking too long. I have to drop the difficulty.
[4077.61s -> 4092.87s]  Name the skeletons. I can't. The gloves just go on automatically. They just get
[4094.23s -> 4102.60s]  reanimated anyway. Well, I mean, look at the EXP bar.
[4105.82s -> 4111.30s]  All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got to drop it. Four of us are whacking on the same guy.
[4113.70s -> 4117.86s]  I'll take it to player support.
[4117.86s -> 4134.17s]  I can do one more skeleton. That's a skill shrine, by the way.
[4137.85s -> 4147.16s]  All right. We're moving to burial ground. I have to be careful. I really do have to take
[4147.16s -> 4150.20s]  this slow because you can't just die in a second, but we're going to go find it.
[4153.85s -> 4159.85s]  All right. Don't just run. Don't fucking run. Oh, that's bad. That's unsafe.
[4159.85s -> 4174.84s]  I hate skeletons. There's one inside of you. That's actually fine.
[4176.36s -> 4189.99s]  Okay. I have five skeletons. Don't I count? Technically. Burial grounds. What do you think?
[4199.43s -> 4206.14s]  Dense and legless pill. Why do you guys keep showing that?
[4206.14s -> 4222.90s]  That's good. It's very, very good.
[4240.38s -> 4245.26s]  Burial grounds. Stony field. God damn it. No, that's wrong. We don't want to go this way yet.
[4247.98s -> 4251.93s]  I'm sure he said worse. I don't have. I said worse.
[4252.89s -> 4255.77s]  I'm not even sure why that would be the worst thing I've ever said in my whole life.
[4256.49s -> 4262.26s]  Okay. This is stupid. I'll just run up. All right. Okay. This is bad. Very bad. Very bad.
[4262.26s -> 4270.42s]  Very bad. I have no stamina. Do I have stamina potions? Okay. This is where it ends.
[4270.42s -> 4284.86s]  Is there a champion in there? Oh, my skeleton. Okay. This is a battle. I have to be very careful.
[4284.86s -> 4286.78s]  I'm going to level up from this.
[4312.79s -> 4316.95s]  Red orb, the health. Yes. Red orb is health and blue orb is mana.
[4317.35s -> 4338.86s]  This is the slowest way to play this game. This is the absolute slug way to play Diablo 2.
[4343.08s -> 4349.00s]  Just stand around and hit each other in the face with rocks. It would be more. All right. Here we
[4349.00s -> 4362.26s]  go. Necromancer gameplay. Here we go. You ready? Skill. Take a look at what we've got available.
[4362.26s -> 4370.60s]  Summoning. Poison and bone. Remember, we've got like, and this shield. Curses. That's available
[4370.60s -> 4378.31s]  up here. Amplify damage. Also, raised skeleton is available and so is skeleton mastery. Please,
[4378.31s -> 4408.02s]  if you could pick a category. Pick a category now. Is it going to end real quick? Okay. We're
[4408.02s -> 4412.02s]  already here. So what skill would you like? Remember, the one to the left is available.
[4412.98s -> 4435.46s]  Skeleton mastery is available. Holy shit. Really? Okay. Okay. Skeleton mastery is really bad.
[4436.02s -> 4446.22s]  I mean, yeah. Well, no, I mean, it could be. Now we make the bone boy strong.
[4447.02s -> 4456.42s]  Thank you for voting. We'll put that into skeleton mastery. Please choose where the five step.
[4456.42s -> 4459.86s]  Fucking God damn it. I showed the goddamn fucking mountains. I'm actually pissed about that. All
[4459.86s -> 4464.74s]  right. Where are we going? By the way, keep in mind, those are not what the points are right
[4464.74s -> 4468.98s]  now. That's just because Blizzard entertainment sucks and I can't capture the window. You know
[4468.98s -> 4489.50s]  what I've said that like three times now. Who cares? Vitality again. Oh, hypers. We like mountains.
[4490.22s -> 4497.85s]  We like mountains. Hype. So I can just click. Yeah. You've become part of the vote. We're
[4497.85s -> 4511.21s]  doing vitality. Thanks for voting for vitality. It's very useful. All right. Vitality. Bang, bang,
[4511.85s -> 4517.46s]  bang. We're not 30 vitality, which is okay. That's pretty good. We now 81 health. Skeleton mastery.
[4517.46s -> 4523.08s]  So our skeletons are going to have plus eight life plus two damage. Pretty good. Okay. Now they're
[4523.08s -> 4535.16s]  just stronger. We still only have three though. Actually, they are lost. Good decision. Nice job.
[4535.16s -> 4537.72s]  Okay.
[4543.32s -> 4548.86s]  I can't wait to do the equivalent for grinding for vials in Bloodborne.
[4550.41s -> 4554.97s]  When everybody dies and there's like 30 people on the screen and I have to go grind for skeletons
[4554.97s -> 4557.77s]  for fucking 15 minutes. That's going to be, that's going to be a lot of fun.
[4567.80s -> 4573.64s]  Wait, that's champion. Champion. Anybody with a net that has a name like that.
[4574.12s -> 4578.84s]  Of course, they're doing much better. You're doing all right.
[4581.72s -> 4586.44s]  All right. Come over here. Bite this thing. Is it like electricity? He's immune to fire.
[4588.36s -> 4598.39s]  All right. Gang up on it. Explode. Does this guy explode? I don't know. He might.
[4600.65s -> 4602.49s]  Okay. He does. Thank God I moved away.
[4602.49s -> 4611.91s]  Okay. That's going to kill me. I'm going to die from that. Guaranteed. I guarantee it.
[4617.10s -> 4628.33s]  Skeletons don't suck. I do. Fresh skeletons. Oh yeah. We had big money coming too like a few
[4628.33s -> 4634.76s]  times. We had 10 communities up some Super Bruce right now. Thank you, Bruce. We also had enough
[4635.48s -> 4642.68s]  5,000 bits from phylactery and AG Joe. Thank you both of you. Jesus. I fucking love skeletons.
[4643.56s -> 4648.18s]  Make sure we go over in detail those at the end of the stream.
[4653.48s -> 4659.16s]  Thank you guys. Seriously. I probably missed more too. I was too busy yelling at the ceiling.
[4659.88s -> 4664.71s]  All right. We need to find the barrel. We're going for a boss.
[4664.71s -> 4671.03s]  I'm still on single digit skeletons. What a rookie.
[4679.05s -> 4685.70s]  Not even possible to do what you're describing. All right. Is this better?
[4685.70s -> 4693.24s]  I lose a point in skeleton, but I'll be able to kill things. Two to four, three to six. I'm going
[4693.24s -> 4701.62s]  to lose. All right. I lose a point in the skeleton. No. Okay. Fine. For health. This thing's broken.
[4701.62s -> 4709.48s]  Fuck it. Let's put this to take that. I'm running out of room here. Four to nine throw damage.
[4710.36s -> 4723.94s]  Do I have her head on three? Same thing. All right. Let's go. Is this guy streaming Diablo?
[4723.94s -> 4731.24s]  Is this guy watching skeletons play Diablo 2 while he streams Diablo 2? All right. Careful.
[4732.36s -> 4734.33s]  He's a champion. They're harder.
[4734.33s -> 4741.27s]  Uh, yes, that is kind of what's happening.
[4747.59s -> 4763.30s]  This is one handed. No, I can't. I can't do well. All right. We've got to level up. We're not going
[4763.30s -> 4772.41s]  to use it yet. All right. We came from this was flabby over here. We came from this way, right?
[4773.88s -> 4780.28s]  Oh yeah. Looking for the burial grounds. Every single, they're all in the edges.
[4780.92s -> 4786.62s]  Essentially, if you follow the road on here, you see, you'll eventually find something to put a
[4786.62s -> 4798.81s]  face cam on a skeleton. This is a random dungeon. I don't want to go in there. In fact, let's just,
[4798.81s -> 4804.82s]  let's find this shit while I have the stamina potion. I can run forever as long as I over there.
[4805.46s -> 4810.25s]  I want to get swarmed by a bunch of fucking people. Dying here is bad. If I don't make it
[4810.25s -> 4816.89s]  through act one, then I got to think of some kind of punishment because that come on. I have to do
[4816.89s -> 4829.08s]  act one burial grounds. Got it. Okay. All right. If I do not, if I die before act one is over,
[4829.64s -> 4836.68s]  I will do a, I will do a mountain stream or like at least five minutes with like calm music in
[4836.68s -> 4843.54s]  the background. Who cares? That's what it was. What does that punishment? All right. Hold on.
[4843.54s -> 4847.34s]  Let me go back. Town portals work the same way they do in the other Diablo games.
[4851.19s -> 4860.74s]  Got to kill blood raven. Greetings. Let's sell all this shit. One, sell, sell, sell.
[4864.78s -> 4871.10s]  This is a, I need a belt. I can only hold four potions at a time. Do you have a belt? Who has
[4871.10s -> 4881.00s]  a belt I can buy? Why did I just fucking identify that? All right. Give me a couple of these.
[4881.88s -> 4886.44s]  All right. I need a belt. Otherwise I'm just going to hold on to these potions in my inventory.
[4886.44s -> 4897.64s]  Belt or strength mountain stream promise. Well, I have to beat act one. I sold the last one. What
[4897.64s -> 4912.57s]  am I stupid? A thousand dollars. All right. This is 200 bucks. So now I get another slot here, but
[4913.85s -> 4920.06s]  still have town portals pair. All right. I'm ready. All right. Let's take a look at what we
[4920.06s -> 4926.58s]  have available. I'm level. All right. So I just, I am level six. We have unlocked and we have
[4926.58s -> 4931.54s]  obviously raised skeleton, skeleton mastery. We also now have clay golem rates of golem from the
[4931.54s -> 4940.28s]  earth to fight at your side. It's just another little buddy. 60 attack, a hundred defense
[4941.24s -> 4948.52s]  with a hundred life, two to five damage and a 20% attack bonus. And it slows enemies just to give
[4948.52s -> 4956.47s]  you an indicator of what that means. So attack 95 and 95 and 50 health. And they do three to four
[4956.47s -> 4964.68s]  damage. There's a difference. We've also unlocked poison dagger. That's poison to your dagger attacks.
[4964.68s -> 4969.32s]  I don't have a dagger, but it will make me do a lot more damage. If need be. We have unlocked
[4969.32s -> 4977.13s]  that. We still have teeth. We've also unlocked another curse dim vision creates a group of
[4977.13s -> 4982.57s]  the curse is a group of monsters reducing their vision radius. I'm not, I have no comment on that
[4982.57s -> 4989.90s]  because that's, um, this, I am not going to give you a comment because I don't want to influence
[4989.90s -> 5013.78s]  anybody's opinion. So, uh, what category would you guys like to go to? Sure. Okay. Now in this
[5013.78s -> 5018.34s]  category, remember you have the top three are available. Clay golem, skeleton mastery and
[5018.34s -> 5026.52s]  skeletons. We're going back to somebody. Where here would you like to go? He's an influencer.
[5027.94s -> 5032.26s]  Okay. All right. We've got it. We've this, we've got, we've now we've got it. Now we've got it.
[5036.41s -> 5040.09s]  Now we've got some actual, you know, people actually have to think about this shit. Now
[5040.81s -> 5055.43s]  you're assembling the squad, more skeletons, goblins. Well, it's a golem, not a goblin.
[5058.09s -> 5066.57s]  Golem, not golem. What did I, I'm stupid. All right. Whoa. What just happened? Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[5066.57s -> 5076.42s]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is going on? Okay. All right.
[5076.42s -> 5080.66s]  Something. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5080.66s -> 5096.97s]  Do it again. Something fucked up just happened there. Do it again. Something's fishy there.
[5107.35s -> 5115.19s]  What is happening? What are you, wait, why, why is this possible right now? There's no 10,000
[5115.19s -> 5140.44s]  people didn't click. One vote per viewer. Start click map. All right. Now we got it. Now it's
[5140.44s -> 5146.89s]  actually working. Somebody was cheating. Yeah. There were, there were some, this is
[5147.85s -> 5164.94s]  the, do it in mastery. Um, we'll do it. I don't know. Do it. Why would you click bought a Diablo
[5164.94s -> 5174.34s]  two stream? Cause you really want more skeletons on the screen. I don't know what the fuck to do
[5174.34s -> 5180.66s]  here because this is, I mean, technically, technically there's a winner. Okay. Three,
[5182.07s -> 5197.46s]  two, one. Thank you for voting. Please choose the stat points. Five are going in.
[5207.74s -> 5213.10s]  Now all of a sudden everybody wants strength, huh? Now magically, randomly people decide that
[5213.10s -> 5226.86s]  that's what they want. You did vitality twice. It's good. Okay. Attack raises skeletons. All
[5226.86s -> 5234.30s]  right. All right. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Easy on those mountains for a second.
[5237.45s -> 5249.64s]  Follow and then worst possible thing you could fucking do. Would you like to see our new friend?
[5249.64s -> 5270.07s]  He's perfect. Okay. Keep going. Now we have to fight the boss. Everything looks good.
[5270.07s -> 5278.46s]  Everything looks good. It's not a skeleton. No, it's not, but I have town portals, right?
[5278.46s -> 5288.57s]  All right. It's time to get blood raven. Everybody good. Let's go. Too many empty graves.
[5288.57s -> 5294.17s]  You made it. This is a poop monster. No, it's a clay monster. It says it in the title of the
[5294.17s -> 5303.53s]  guy's stream. Here we go. Go. There she is. All right. I can actually die from this like very,
[5303.53s -> 5334.98s]  very, very easily. He's absorbing so much damage. He's just a skeleton with extra step.
[5343.58s -> 5361.66s]  Dude, we're just fine. This is fine. Good on my friends. Say that now. Nobody even died.
[5363.34s -> 5374.02s]  All right. Get in there. Let's go. It's around. It's around. Circle, circle, circle, circle,
[5374.02s -> 5387.93s]  surround. Get her. Come on. Get her. Don't let her get away. Get the dagger, please.
[5389.05s -> 5422.34s]  I'm going to be here for a while. Three, two, one. I can't use this, but it's pretty cool.
[5422.34s -> 5427.86s]  There's a dagger. Nice job, guys. You did a good job. Our first bearer of the game,
[5430.66s -> 5437.06s]  40 strength required. Don't take that as an opportunity. Don't take that as an opportunity.
[5443.77s -> 5448.01s]  Charms just have to be in your inventory and they get whatever is the bonus that's on it. So I
[5448.01s -> 5455.29s]  plus the root of strength. As long as it's in my inventory, I get it. 5% chance to cast level one
[5455.29s -> 5460.49s]  amplify damage on striking. More damage to demons. More attack rating, which means you hit
[5461.21s -> 5465.85s]  more often against demons. Fire damage and 4% life stolen per hit. Cool.
[5469.19s -> 5482.63s]  We also get a, we're doing the blood rating quest. We get a companion. Kyle. Kyle. Kyle's back.
[5487.56s -> 5494.52s]  Respect stranger and the allegiance of the rogues. I have placed several of my best warriors at your
[5494.52s -> 5506.42s]  disposal. Mod her. Uh, she needs a bow. It is clear that we are facing difficult to comprehend,
[5507.06s -> 5515.14s]  let alone combat. There is only one Haradrim Sage in the most arcane history and law who could
[5515.14s -> 5522.38s]  advise us. You must go to Tristram and find him. We know. All right. We've got to go through the
[5522.38s -> 5527.43s]  dark wood. There's a tree. This is where it gets a little, this is where the game actually gets a
[5527.43s -> 5533.58s]  little bit more difficult, especially when we go to Tristram. Uh, this is her inventory.
[5535.59s -> 5543.48s]  Give her something. Let's go get a bow. Good day. Even if it sucks, doesn't matter as long
[5543.48s -> 5554.55s]  you just have one. Uh, $177. Take it. And manna. Do I have anything that has a socket in it?
[5555.35s -> 5566.25s]  Let's just stash it for now. I'm not going to sell this. Hold on. Maybe I just should sell it.
[5566.25s -> 5569.05s]  This is just giving you guys incentives that are going to make me have 40 strength.
[5569.93s -> 5580.78s]  Control click on an item. What are you talking about? I can't use that. You can't use that.
[5581.42s -> 5596.31s]  Need to be level five to use this piece of shit. What? All right. Let's go, uh, get Deckard Cain.
[5597.80s -> 5601.32s]  The level two companion. Oh, that's the problem. That's a huge problem.
[5602.50s -> 5614.09s]  Good day. I have three portals. That should be enough. Everyone's good to go. Let's move.
[5617.86s -> 5624.62s]  So we need to go through our memory serves me correctly here. We got to go to stony field
[5625.34s -> 5630.30s]  and then through the underground passage, right? What are the underground passages of the dark
[5630.30s -> 5641.70s]  wood? Yeah. Turn your face came up and play ads. I don't think I'm going to do that. That
[5641.70s -> 5654.39s]  doesn't sound like something that I would want to do. I'm good so far. Let's move. Use this.
[5656.06s -> 5661.02s]  What level two piece of this? All right. You can use this. I'll put that to good use.
[5661.02s -> 5665.45s]  Every act has a different companion by the way. And we're not even going to care.
[5665.77s -> 5677.05s]  I have 50 companions anyways, or maybe not. What's this? Germacraft. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5679.61s -> 5689.14s]  What? Why did I, why did I need to see this? What's the point in me seeing?
[5698.14s -> 5700.38s]  It's me holding a diamond pickaxe.
[5719.10s -> 5728.26s]  All right. All of me. The real test is if I can, I kill and are you'll coming up here in a little
[5728.26s -> 5749.90s]  bit. I got excited for the club because I just kept seeing me using it as was this an armor
[5749.90s -> 5756.22s]  and manna. Yeah. I mean this shit. Look at that. Just go up like and fucking sick. Wait,
[5756.22s -> 5764.04s]  you can wear this. Can you? Yes, you can. I wasn't even dying. This is actually going pretty well.
[5765.56s -> 5769.16s]  And Dario poison is going to one shot your minions. Yes, that's true. This is going to,
[5769.16s -> 5771.64s]  it's actually going to be probably a fucking nightmare. It's going to be an absolute
[5771.64s -> 5793.45s]  nightmare. We shall see how this goes. With that too, can't you?
[5796.81s -> 5805.78s]  And you're safe now. Going good. Do not die to recognize you.
[5806.34s -> 5819.80s]  Okay. That's why I killed fucking Diablo with this shit.
[5823.54s -> 5833.88s]  I would need to go down and then up. That's what I wanted.
[5839.53s -> 5854.86s]  It gets past. Storm. What's it? Storm wing with demon or enchanted. All right. Just let my
[5855.90s -> 5878.95s]  friends die here. Skeleton's op like half of exile.
[5879.91s -> 5883.91s]  Oh, it depends on what you mean by that because the answer is no, but it could be yes.
[5890.84s -> 5895.86s]  Out game. Yeah. Why is it doing this?
[5900.09s -> 5906.17s]  Runs us so loud. I'm crying. Yeah. I don't know why it's doing that.
[5917.77s -> 5924.18s]  That music's fucking awesome in this game. All right, let's go. I'm going to make my
[5924.18s -> 5930.10s]  run for it here. This is, this is a little ballsy, but you know, okay.
[5931.38s -> 5934.10s]  That's too, a little too ballsy potentially.
[5936.71s -> 5947.40s]  Where's that at? Level two. I don't want level two though. I want the dark wood.
[5948.92s -> 5954.81s]  Oh, don't go that way. Don't be a fool. I know, I know, I know, I know. But if I have the
[5954.81s -> 5959.05s]  stamina potion though, if I have the stamina shrine, then just go for it.
[5959.05s -> 5967.03s]  You know, you can run faster than everybody else. Oh, his CD key is banned. Yeah, I know. That's
[5967.03s -> 5983.66s]  what I'm saying. Why? I didn't do anything. That could have been real bad. Run, run, run, run,
[5983.66s -> 5989.58s]  run, run, run. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[5996.55s -> 6001.99s]  Holy shit. Okay. This is bad. This is very fucking bad. I, I, this is a, why did I do this?
[6002.63s -> 6008.73s]  All right. Now I'm good. Holy shit. Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[6008.73s -> 6014.73s]  I can't die right now. I don't want to do a mountain stream for 10 minutes. Where's everybody?
[6022.97s -> 6025.45s]  Oh shit. That's it. Okay. All right. All right. Oh my God. I'm going to die.
[6026.09s -> 6046.23s]  Oh my God. People are dying. We're good. We're okay. We're okay. We've used homeward bone.
[6048.71s -> 6060.89s]  Everything's going to be just fine. Where's, where are my skeletons? All right. Just stay
[6060.89s -> 6079.18s]  over there for a second. Why am I already full? I gotta get out of this. Uh, it's probably right
[6079.18s -> 6107.59s]  up here. My boots are broken. That's too ballsy. Stop. Part of me is actually kind of glad this is
[6107.59s -> 6111.67s]  happening like this because otherwise this would be, it would be, I'd be all alone in here.
[6112.31s -> 6127.21s]  I don't want that. Good, good, good, good, good. Good work. Although this is dead end.
[6144.66s -> 6150.42s]  Don't die. I'm almost out of stamina. Oh, this is a bad idea. Oh, this is a bad idea. What am I
[6150.42s -> 6154.63s]  doing? What do I do? I gotta slow down, slow down, slow down, top order. Get out, get out, get out,
[6154.63s -> 6159.03s]  get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,
[6159.03s -> 6163.51s]  get out of the game. Get out, get out. I need health, health, health right now. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[6167.40s -> 6175.96s]  Okay. I almost just died. That was actually, yeah. Cause if that's it, if I'm dead, I can't really
[6175.96s -> 6192.81s]  seriously have to be careful. No, leave, like actually leave over here. Okay. What is it on
[6192.81s -> 6205.37s]  player count? Like six. I should probably turn that off and help. Is that it's on four or I'm
[6205.37s -> 6222.14s]  gonna set it to three. I got body blocked by everybody standing around that. I got bothered
[6222.14s -> 6234.25s]  like my own, my own friends. All right, let's pick something. 2000 playthroughs and he has to
[6234.25s -> 6240.42s]  play on three. I didn't make any of these decisions. This 30 points in strength right now as a necro.
[6241.42s -> 6250.17s]  Do you want to stay like that? What do you want me to do about that? That's what I'm saying. When
[6250.17s -> 6256.23s]  people come to this dream and they see like, Oh, Diablo two sick. Wow. There's people watching
[6256.23s -> 6261.59s]  this. I love Diablo two. What's this idiot doing? Somebody help him. Please help him.
[6263.70s -> 6269.45s]  All right. What are we doing for, uh, you know what to do? Well, actually take a look where here's
[6269.45s -> 6276.49s]  what we have raised skeleton, like golem. You can do another point in the clay. Golem will increase
[6276.49s -> 6280.97s]  the health and everything, make them better. Poison and bone. Same ones are available. Poison, dagger,
[6281.61s -> 6287.56s]  teeth, bone armor. This is survivability. This is me actually being able to do anything else
[6287.56s -> 6293.96s]  besides stand around and hit with a stick. And we also have dim vision and amplify damage.
[6295.48s -> 6316.15s]  Seeing what they do. Okay. Here we go. Where are we going? I'm going to keep quiet.
[6317.03s -> 6340.63s]  I don't want to influence anything. Why does this keep happening? And again, all right,
[6340.63s -> 6347.66s]  I have the check box set for only allow one click per user. But if I reset the poll, I have to do
[6347.66s -> 6362.68s]  that. Okay. Here we go. Here it is again. You need an updated screenshot. I might as well just open
[6362.68s -> 6378.89s]  up like a webpage and just show it on there. I'm closing it in 10 seconds. Poison and bone it is.
[6379.69s -> 6399.26s]  Okay. Uh, remember I'll show you again what we have available here. Teeth, bone armor, poison,
[6399.26s -> 6410.71s]  dagger. That is what's currently available right now. God damn it. Whatever. All right. What do you
[6410.71s -> 6431.29s]  want? It's up to you. Nice background. Whatever. Hey, uh, Jeremiah, I don't mean to backseat,
[6431.29s -> 6442.82s]  but this is not a good build. Really? Damn. I, I thought this was going to be really good.
[6442.82s -> 6448.18s]  I thought I was going to be able to get the first boss. All right. Let's do teeth. Good choice.
[6449.30s -> 6461.74s]  Not really. Cause I have no mana. How the hell am I going to cast this? Uh, two teeth come out.
[6461.74s -> 6474.50s]  It does two to four damage now. Here we go. Here are my current stats right now.
[6474.50s -> 6477.14s]  Just to make sure you guys see that what the image you're going to see is a little outdated.
[6478.18s -> 6499.26s]  Okay. Take a step using the F keys. You have to. All right. All right. Not bad decisions so far.
[6499.26s -> 6524.34s]  Not bad. Could be way worse. Energy sucks. All right. All right. Five points of going
[6524.34s -> 6540.54s]  in energy. Let's go. Thanks everybody. We repair and okay. So this is a day. This is a very dangerous
[6540.54s -> 6554.49s]  portal, right? This is that this portal will kill me. I have to be careful. I'm going to make a
[6554.49s -> 6558.33s]  portal immediately when going through this portal and you're going to, we're going to do something
[6558.33s -> 6563.82s]  to cast teeth at people. Let's do it. Three, two, one, go.
[6576.92s -> 6586.68s]  Dude fog. What's the level up again? Wait, why am I going to, why am I leveling up so fast?
[6586.68s -> 6603.48s]  Wait, what? What's happened? How did I level up so fast? Cheating? Am I? I don't think so.
[6604.52s -> 6623.13s]  Are we doing skeleton doll life? This is how you got banned. I was so pissed off when I saw that.
[6623.85s -> 6630.04s]  Oh, and I can't even get another CD key. That's the worst part. I have to buy the game and send
[6630.04s -> 6651.88s]  it to somebody else. But then they have to open it and give me their CD key. Make a new account.
[6651.88s -> 6669.19s]  Yeah. I would have to make a brand new account on battle net to buy Diablo two again. This is
[6669.19s -> 6676.31s]  going really well. I'm going to make a prediction. I'm going to beat and Ariel is the first major
[6676.39s -> 6679.43s]  boss of the game. By the way, we're going to get a first unique in the game. You should be excited
[6679.43s -> 6690.10s]  about that. It's going to be very hectic. I'm going to be very scared. It's okay because I'll
[6690.10s -> 6707.91s]  have a couple of friends, large acts, 35 strength. Can use it. I do more damage just by swinging
[6707.91s -> 6713.27s]  because I have so much strength. Okay. So this is, this is why this is so dumb. So you pick teeth,
[6713.27s -> 6717.91s]  which is fine, but I do more damage by swinging because I have 30 strength.
[6718.07s -> 6732.01s]  Okay. So I may as well put on that two handed weapon. You know what I mean? At this point,
[6732.01s -> 6743.22s]  it's sort of a lost cause. We're going to have multiple points. Your hit rate is 10%.
[6745.21s -> 6747.45s]  That's yeah, that's right. All right. Dark wood. Here we are.
[6749.48s -> 6755.24s]  Uh, get this out of here. I don't want this. Now we're looking for the tree.
[6762.65s -> 6766.33s]  Get away from me. Somebody with electricity in it. Somebody with electricity. Electricity,
[6766.33s -> 6770.73s]  the worst thing in the whole game. Who has electricity? Who has electricity on them?
[6777.91s -> 6781.83s]  I don't see anybody in there with electricity, but why did that come up? Who has it? Yep.
[6781.83s -> 6791.96s]  There's somebody in there that has it. I see them. Oh my God. Okay. Run. One skeleton. That's not
[6791.96s -> 6811.00s]  good. We're good. We're good. Don't get hit by the lightning. I got to kill. This is shaman
[6811.00s -> 6823.74s]  somewhere. There you are. It's too stressful. Why did I want to do this? This is too stressful.
[6823.74s -> 6826.30s]  It really is. Especially when you get a little bit later here.
[6834.07s -> 6850.26s]  I have to kill the guys with the staff. Help me skeleton. All right. He's one dead.
[6850.26s -> 6857.16s]  Where's my golem? All right. My golem is he's doing a good job. He's currently surrounded.
[6859.29s -> 6867.38s]  What? Where? Okay. Where's another shaman dead? There you are. Oh, you motherfuckers. This is
[6867.38s -> 6882.50s]  ridiculous. Oh my God. This is a mess. This is an actual mess. I have to leave and level up again,
[6882.50s -> 6896.66s]  I think. Yep. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. No. What? Yeah. Actually
[6896.66s -> 6911.35s]  put a safe teleporter down here. Okay. Do I have any money? Get rid of this. No saw. Wait.
[6911.91s -> 6920.25s]  22 attack rating. Should just put it in. Who cares? All right. I need load up potions.
[6920.97s -> 6930.90s]  How many do I have? I get some more. Okay. What level are we now? We are level eight. We have
[6930.90s -> 6938.60s]  opened up a couple of new things because you put a point to teeth. One point is in teeth right now.
[6939.40s -> 6945.91s]  It just increases the amount of teeth and the amount of damage. Armor as well. There's corpse
[6945.91s -> 6950.39s]  explosion. Cast on the corpse of a slain monster. It explodes damaging nearby enemy.
[6951.03s -> 6959.86s]  Okay. Pretty good. Poison dagger. That's what's available in poison and bone. We have still the
[6959.86s -> 6964.34s]  same curses available. Amplify and envision and we still have the same summoning ability.
[6965.22s -> 6974.50s]  Do not get new ones until level 12. Roll over so you can see what would happen if I put a
[6974.50s -> 6991.46s]  point into these. Okay. All right. So you've seen it. Please choose a category if you would.
[6995.67s -> 7005.32s]  He thinks anyone cares. That's kind of the point of the stream is to have people pick something
[7005.32s -> 7013.64s]  crazy for a hardcore. He thinks anyone cares. Oh, don't be so mean. Why are you being so mean?
[7013.64s -> 7037.98s]  Kind of torn, but it looks like summoning. Okay. Good. Oh, we're still in summoning. So
[7037.98s -> 7042.22s]  you only have three choices here. Two into play golem. Another one into, you only have three
[7042.22s -> 7056.89s]  options. Go ahead and pick one. Well, that's a hundred percent. This will make four skeletons.
[7058.23s -> 7069.00s]  He's going to start crying. Well, that's, there's no coming back from this 76% one another skeleton.
[7082.26s -> 7091.30s]  This will be a level of six points into skeleton, which will get us to four skeletons. There's now
[7091.30s -> 7096.34s]  time to choose some. Well, I'll show you here. Here's where the stats currently stand. 30, 25,
[7096.34s -> 7104.15s]  30, 30, 30, 25, 30, 30. Those are where the stats are right now.
[7104.95s -> 7131.58s]  Where am I going? Yeah. I've never done anything like this before in this game. So this is kind
[7131.58s -> 7143.06s]  of an interesting, I mean, I guess I can hit things harder. Does that, well, I'll be able to
[7143.06s -> 7157.54s]  wear some really, really heavy armor. Thanks for voting everybody. That'll bring us to
[7157.70s -> 7181.27s]  to 35 strength. Can I, uh, one, look at, okay. One to 27 damage. That is so terrible.
[7185.50s -> 7192.36s]  All right. Let's bring, let's resurrect Kyle. All right. We need to, how many, how many,
[7192.36s -> 7195.40s]  what do I have for, all right. I only, let me get some more portals. I only have one.
[7196.12s -> 7216.55s]  Okay. I feel safe now. Fresh. I can get four skeletons. Can I resurrect anybody here? No.
[7216.55s -> 7238.46s]  All right. Let's go. Three, two, one. Let's go. Fuck. Oh my God. Don't do it. The champion's
[7238.46s -> 7251.35s]  almost dead. Get in there. What are you doing? Get in there. He's just standing around. Get in
[7251.35s -> 7267.05s]  the fight. She's still alive. First she's in here somewhere. She dead. I don't know. Just kill the
[7267.05s -> 7286.90s]  doctors. Yeah. She's right there. The blue one. Oh, okay. I can't even walk over there.
[7287.94s -> 7305.72s]  Don't please kill her. Kill demon lightning enchantment. The worst die. I leveled up again.
[7309.61s -> 7320.15s]  Nice. Good work. It is hard leather armor here. God damn it. I didn't mean to do that. 15 to
[7320.15s -> 7336.58s]  strength. What's it got? 21 defense. I'd rather have that than the health. You see what, okay.
[7336.58s -> 7353.70s]  Go ahead. If I put on the huge ax, I lose a skeleton. That's true.
[7354.66s -> 7371.11s]  Keep that in mind. Do bugleberry right now or riot. I'm not going to do that. Okay. You do have
[7371.11s -> 7384.84s]  another point to put in. Let's go ahead and do this first. I mean, if you look, if you're going to
[7384.84s -> 7394.07s]  make me do this, then I have, look at two to five, two to 40. That's it. This is good, but I lost a
[7394.07s -> 7403.13s]  skeleton. Here's what's available. The same ones from last time. Obviously corpse explosion, teeth,
[7403.13s -> 7411.26s]  bone armor, skeleton, which we lost it because we had plus one from the wand and also one and one
[7411.26s -> 7418.92s]  in skeleton mastery and in clay foam. Please choose the category if you would. I appreciate it.
[7419.80s -> 7438.70s]  We lost a friend. Bring back friend. Yeah. Use that skill point and compensate.
[7439.82s -> 7449.30s]  I'm actually going to be pretty useful though. Okay. Well, what do you want to up? You have,
[7449.94s -> 7455.30s]  you could, you could do skeleton mastery, clay golem, or replace the skeleton that we just
[7455.30s -> 7486.65s]  lost. Remember you're going to get clapped in the dirt before end areal. I don't think so. Okay.
[7486.65s -> 7494.60s]  Four skeletons. This is what they currently have for a bonus. We are level nine. Let's go.
[7495.40s -> 7506.86s]  How slow is this? It's pretty slow, but I feel like it's going to be kind of good.
[7506.86s -> 7523.94s]  Oh, look at the tree. It's too many people. I'm one hit killing everything though.
[7523.94s -> 7531.70s]  So it's not terrible. He's not picking up the gold. I'm trying to stay alive.
[7544.54s -> 7557.82s]  Actually not that bad. Swole man, sir. Oh, she leveled up. Grand charm. Give me
[7563.88s -> 7566.20s]  running around with a two handed sword as an answer.
[7566.20s -> 7574.31s]  All right. Let's do one. We need to find the, uh, the tree. And when I find the tree,
[7574.31s -> 7581.26s]  it's instantly run away from the tree because it's, you're guaranteed to die. If you do not
[7581.26s -> 7601.43s]  run instantly away from the tree, the tree is scary. Yes, it is hard. No, I don't want it.
[7605.90s -> 7609.90s]  Tree fist is going to kill them. Don't say that because it's potentially accurate.
[7612.12s -> 7638.79s]  It's so scary when you find the tree because they just sprint at you. All right. That's good.
[7638.79s -> 7643.77s]  Six to life. What do I have right now? Is it strength? No, keep the strength on.
[7646.76s -> 7662.71s]  Trying to pay attention to him. He's still, he was like a week ago, but he's still recovering.
[7665.58s -> 7670.70s]  Show us that. I don't see at least a thousand cog champs right now. I will turn the stream off.
[7671.82s -> 7684.62s]  I'm going to count. Hey, good. Nice work. I knew you guys could do it.
[7687.27s -> 7695.69s]  Ooh, they're terrible. 10% fast, one to dexterity, cold. At least it's cold resistant.
[7695.69s -> 7701.35s]  Better than what I had on. I have six cold resist. Holy fuck. That's a lot of pogs.
[7703.82s -> 7706.46s]  All right. Give me the gold. People are yelling at me, but I'll pick it up the gold. And yes,
[7706.46s -> 7717.94s]  I know. I agree. I need it. I'm going to put another, uh, I was on the, I just did another
[7717.94s -> 7731.37s]  hog. I don't know why. If Kyle stuff, no, I'm going to dump Kyle pretty soon here.
[7736.31s -> 7743.19s]  Large acts. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do I have? Um, this shit's
[7744.63s -> 7766.58s]  he hates Kyle. No, I don't level up. This actually might make and Ariel easier because I can
[7766.58s -> 7774.44s]  actually swing and I'm going to do damage. This might be, I'm not, I'm not scared at the moment.
[7774.44s -> 7789.05s]  I will be in a little bit though. Play point. Thank God. All right. Give me a second. It's all
[7789.05s -> 7798.68s]  part of the plan. Trust chat. Well, it's hard to do that. Right. I still have, uh, no sockets.
[7798.68s -> 7802.20s]  Right. When I get the cube, you can eventually combine these, but they're going to be worthless
[7802.20s -> 7814.97s]  in about 40 minutes. How many keys do I have? I have too many mana potions. Why do I even have
[7814.97s -> 7830.07s]  these? Absolutely useless. Dude, two minutes of gameplay, 10 minutes of leveling up. Yeah,
[7830.07s -> 7842.07s]  you know it. Let's go. All right. Well, we got this. We got you with same choices. Same choices
[7842.07s -> 7847.11s]  are available. We still have four skeletons, skeleton masteries available. Golem is available.
[7848.34s -> 7854.81s]  We still have corpse explosion, which is available. Bone armor, poison dagger is still curses
[7854.81s -> 7863.51s]  available. Here's what will happen if you put a point into this. Damage goes up by a little bit.
[7863.51s -> 7868.94s]  It also happens here. Increases life and damage of raised skeletons and revived creatures.
[7869.50s -> 7874.98s]  And then amplify damages is incredible, but it's not my choice. Okay. Go ahead and pick.
[7877.50s -> 7892.41s]  These will start slowing down as we level up though. Don't worry. As always, it looks like
[7892.41s -> 7908.79s]  we're going to skeleton. Are we? Or do I just assume the worst? Okay. Well, we're on the right
[7908.79s -> 7928.95s]  page. Uh, which one? All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Corpse explosion, resident sleeper, skeleton
[7928.95s -> 7946.12s]  population explosion, pog champ. It is going into skeleton mastery. Uh, what about stats?
[7947.16s -> 7951.40s]  Strength, dexterity, vitality, energy, which one?
[7968.82s -> 7983.91s]  Getting smarter. They're getting smarter. That's good. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Don't downplay
[7983.91s -> 8000.15s]  yourself. You just pick the one you did is good. So we're doing skeleton mastery, which will go up
[8000.15s -> 8007.64s]  from life 8%. It's just doubling their life eventually damage. So now let's see what they
[8007.64s -> 8015.40s]  do with three to five damage and they have 60 health, six to seven damage, and they have 68
[8015.40s -> 8028.58s]  health. So now they're going to be pretty good, not terrible play. And then everything else looks
[8028.58s -> 8048.34s]  good. Let's go. Dude, pod three minutes to gameplay. Here it comes. Magic find is really good,
[8048.34s -> 8056.33s]  but I'll keep the strength on. Oh shit. Watch out. He's a chump. Let's kill him.
[8061.53s -> 8066.89s]  Best opportunity to get prayers and uniques is from named enemies. Right.
[8067.21s -> 8080.46s]  Dude, fucking residence sleeper gameplay. What is this shit? I want to see level it up.
[8081.58s -> 8095.50s]  Where's the tree? I think it's right over here. Damage shrine. Good. Very useful. Let's go. Don't
[8095.50s -> 8112.52s]  get overwhelmed. Three, three, three, three, three. Still no tree. This house is burning, but
[8114.04s -> 8121.98s]  free. I would take that skill shrine, but I don't want it because I wouldn't be able to run.
[8122.70s -> 8133.83s]  Where the hell is it? I got the waypoint. What's the over under on me? Screaming when tree
[8133.83s -> 8139.83s]  fist appears. Ah, it depends. How does the game lag and does he instantly teleport next to me?
[8140.71s -> 8154.63s]  Is that what happens? Probably this way. Depends on who sees who first. Yes, it does. All right.
[8154.63s -> 8162.95s]  Slow down. I need my skeleton. There he is. There he is. Okay. All right. There he is. There he is.
[8162.95s -> 8180.65s]  I didn't scream. I didn't scream. He's not even that bad. He's fine. I'm good. He walked right
[8180.65s -> 8195.61s]  into the okay. He just got destroyed. That wouldn't even scared. That was easy. There's the tree.
[8196.33s -> 8206.31s]  This tree shines with inner spirits. What did he drop? Anything good? I am overburdened.
[8209.08s -> 8214.34s]  Free defense. That sucks. And I'll keep that on you. You wear this.
[8216.50s -> 8220.70s]  There's a scroll. Look at all these potions I have. What a waste of space.
[8222.06s -> 8230.50s]  Waste of space. These are I'm going to sell some shit. All right. Now we're going to go to Stony
[8230.50s -> 8237.32s]  Field and go to Tristram and hopefully not lose. Hey, are you winning? Are you winning?
[8242.20s -> 8246.76s]  You must find the cairn stones and touch them in the order that I have written.
[8247.48s -> 8252.92s]  Yes, we do. Go to the cairn stones in the Stony Field. Touch the stones in the order of the scroll.
[8254.12s -> 8259.42s]  What was the thing everyone was saying? Will? Well, there was at least a few people that said
[8259.42s -> 8267.74s]  will he get past Rakaneshu. This is the real test, I think. Coming up right now. All right.
[8267.74s -> 8275.67s]  Let's get rid of some of this shit. Like get out of here. Put the magic find on instead. Sure.
[8279.64s -> 8307.27s]  Okay. Stash some of this shit. Do I keep this stuff on? Eh, it's fine. Okay. Now we have to
[8307.27s -> 8313.27s]  go to the Stony Field, which is further back. Pole Plane, Stony Field. I think I already did.
[8313.27s -> 8319.43s]  I found it. Didn't I already before? Yeah, it's right down here. Look at that. We're already
[8319.43s -> 8332.82s]  ready to go. Wrong. Did I do the Countess? I did not. I may skip the Countess and go right for
[8332.82s -> 8337.21s]  Endereal. I know that's a terrible idea, but sometimes you got to go for the hard play.
[8337.77s -> 8350.22s]  Look at the Stony Field. Oh, EXP Shrine. Kill. Come on. You get like triple the amount of
[8350.22s -> 8364.06s]  experience. How do I have no stamina? Doesn't make any sense. Kill something quick, please.
[8364.70s -> 8379.29s]  I gotta get back on the road. These Countess skip people equals skipping levels. Yeah. I mean,
[8379.29s -> 8389.29s]  the end of Act 1 is actually pretty hard. Is this Stony Field or is this Burial Grounds?
[8389.93s -> 8396.57s]  Is that Burial Grounds? It's Burial Grounds. All right. It's up there.
[8397.13s -> 8403.05s]  Oh, I got Stand Stills with my stupid ass stamina can refill. Why don't you stack stamina potions?
[8403.05s -> 8425.00s]  Because I forgot that we have 40 points in strength. I forgot. Go, go, go, go, go.
[8425.96s -> 8430.52s]  Tristram, pause the game. I have to go. There is no pause in Diablo. Yes, there is. What?
[8430.52s -> 8440.42s]  Oh, I'm not playing online, right? Yeah, there is. Pause the game. Not yet. We're not going to.
[8440.42s -> 8446.06s]  Our first break is coming soon. After I go through Tristram, we'll do our first break.
[8446.06s -> 8452.44s]  I'm in it for the long haul tonight, guys. I want to see just how far I can get
[8453.08s -> 8460.94s]  before reliably turning the stream off and being safe. Pause. What about my pizza roll?
[8461.90s -> 8469.34s]  You'll be OK. Look for the stones. You'll know when I find the stones when you see a blue guy.
[8470.54s -> 8487.11s]  We're looking for the blue guy. Give me that. I'd rather have that right now.
[8488.07s -> 8494.46s]  Who cares about the experience? I'll get it. Stones, stones. Found it. OK. OK. Run, run, run, run.
[8496.70s -> 8498.62s]  All right. Let's go. I'll leave it to Shirley. We'll take this out.
[8498.62s -> 8525.82s]  Any shamas over here? There he is. Go get him. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
[8530.78s -> 8548.68s]  Why is Teeth selected? Why is Teeth selected? Why is he chasing me? Nice. All right. Turn it on.
[8549.24s -> 8567.59s]  What about Griswold, though? He's scary. Good Tristram. 21, 21. Sucks. All right.
[8568.39s -> 8574.30s]  All that's left of proud Tristram are ghosts and ashes. We have four skeletons.
[8574.86s -> 8597.02s]  Let's go. Take it slow. There's no reason to do this fast. Holy shit. OK. We'll run.
[8598.94s -> 8608.44s]  He can do amplify damage to you. So I gotta be careful. Like that. No. Actually, I did that.
[8609.32s -> 8612.84s]  Oh, that's right. This thing has a 5% chance to amplify damage. For God's sake.
[8628.81s -> 8646.09s]  Die. Run. Run away. He didn't drop anything. He dropped shit. All right. We're good. Keep going.
[8646.65s -> 8662.94s]  Dammit, a potion. Get it. OK. This is where we get Wirt's leg.
[8666.74s -> 8687.34s]  My goal is to kill the shamas. That's all I'm going to do. OK. He's left. Right here. Champions.
[8687.98s -> 8698.44s]  There's Wirt. I do a lot of damage to this thing. It's actually kind of good. All right. Here we go.
[8698.44s -> 8717.99s]  Where's Wirt? Where is he? Right here. Two to eight. One to 27. I could. All right. I might
[8717.99s -> 8743.13s]  actually use this. I might just put like three gems in it. Go get Deckard Cain. He's in here,
[8743.13s -> 8754.12s]  surrounded by people. Help. Help. Deckard Cain. Move quickly. And that's barbarian. Wrong person.
[8766.41s -> 8785.59s]  Say the rest. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. We got two levels up.
[8787.72s -> 8794.20s]  Am I level 10? Level 12. Wow. We're moving right along. Level 12. Are you kidding me?
[8794.20s -> 8811.10s]  This is fucking easy. The game's not even fucking hard. All right. Let's get out. I got a lot of
[8811.10s -> 8822.50s]  damage. We made it. Here he is. Hello. As a token of my gratitude, I will identify items for you at
[8822.50s -> 8829.22s]  no charge. Regrettably, I could do nothing to. I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which
[8829.22s -> 8836.90s]  devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo,
[8836.90s -> 8839.54s]  the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world. Our greatest fear has
[8839.54s -> 8845.94s]  come to pass. Chat has made an acromancer with 40 strength. As you know, some time ago, Diablo
[8845.94s -> 8857.11s]  was straining against Tristram. He might as well just go home. Let one of the adults take over.
[8859.35s -> 8863.99s]  Yet as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof.
[8864.55s -> 8870.15s]  He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and. There's no way you can beat Diablo
[8870.15s -> 8878.25s]  with that shit, Bill. Perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out
[8878.25s -> 8886.52s]  of his mind. Okay, fine. Stay awhile and listen. Hey, I ate some food and you're still alive. Good
[8886.52s -> 8891.48s]  job. Yeah, we're doing fine. You have risked your life. Oh yeah, you get a ring doing this
[8891.48s -> 8894.76s]  and then it always just sucks. Nice magic damage reduced by one.
[8895.56s -> 8906.06s]  There's probably more nutritional value inside that ring from a box of lucky charms. You know
[8906.06s -> 8910.78s]  what I'm trying to say. All right, let's sell. Have we got what levels up to do? And then we're
[8910.78s -> 8914.06s]  going, we're going for it. We're going for our Dario. Fuck it. I'm going, we're going right for
[8914.06s -> 8936.98s]  it. This is where it gets hard. I have a keyboard's leg. Uh, it's time to gamble. He's getting too
[8937.54s -> 8949.99s]  confident. It's fine. Hey, good day to you. I'm good. I'd never have to lay my eyes on one of
[8949.99s -> 8960.90s]  your kind. You didn't even do it. Yes. A gambling is you don't know what it is, but it could be a
[8960.90s -> 8968.01s]  rare. I have $5,000. What do I need to replace? Uh, this is this shit. You can give me something
[8968.01s -> 8974.70s]  better than this belt. Should I try to get a better belt? I still have gloves. These gloves
[8974.70s -> 8989.43s]  are so bad gloves. All right. That was bad. Heavy armor. Yeah. I can wear it. Can I,
[8990.23s -> 9005.16s]  I think I can wear it. Sword. I go for sword or club rings. The rings are 63,000 Goldie
[9007.48s -> 9015.05s]  new armor. Yeah. Let's, let's see if we can get some armor. All right. Chain mail 18,000.
[9015.05s -> 9021.05s]  All right. Here we go. I don't have enough money. This shit just drops on the ground.
[9021.53s -> 9036.15s]  Does he hate the music that I should be turned off? Oh, I want this. All right. That's better.
[9036.15s -> 9043.56s]  Now I'll have more slots. Seven life, three mana. Let's go. See that was worth it. All right. I'm
[9043.56s -> 9052.12s]  done. I'm done, done, done, done, done, done. Put this shit in here. My favorite part about this
[9052.12s -> 9061.11s]  game is organizing gems. It's just somehow satisfying to me. I've got potions. I need
[9061.11s -> 9074.60s]  another row. Yeah. I'm going to just buy like two or three. Wait, I'm just, I'm buying back the ones
[9074.60s -> 9091.35s]  I sold. What the fuck is going on? All right. So we have 10 stat points to put in. Where do you
[9091.35s -> 9098.81s]  want me to put 10 stat points? We're doing well. 10 points. Where do you want them? Take a look.
[9098.81s -> 9131.03s]  Is that what it looks like? Mountains? Any mountains? Hey Otto, what are you doing over there?
[9135.06s -> 9146.33s]  Any mountain fans in here? All right. 10 points are going to strength. I'm going to be the heaviest
[9147.29s -> 9162.36s]  acrobat ever. Okay. What about, we have two points. Let's take a look at what we have
[9162.36s -> 9171.91s]  and some new stuff though. So check it out. First, let's do this. That was painful to do.
[9174.73s -> 9181.30s]  So we have a couple of new things here. Again, we have, here's what happens with Ray's skeleton.
[9181.30s -> 9191.24s]  We have skeleton mastery still. We do not get a fifth skeleton. Play Golem. We've Golem mastery
[9191.24s -> 9198.58s]  has unlocked. Enhances speed and life of your Golems. More health and more attack and they
[9198.58s -> 9208.95s]  walk faster. Or skeleton mage. Just like regular skeleton, it revives a, this adds to your skeleton
[9208.95s -> 9218.01s]  pool and it's a mage, not melee. It shoots ice, fire, lightning, et cetera. They're a lot weaker,
[9218.01s -> 9225.64s]  but they still get skeleton mastery. Still get a bonus from this.
[9229.16s -> 9234.60s]  You can't do anything here because no one's picking anything here. This all remains the same.
[9234.60s -> 9239.72s]  Poison Dagger, teeth, bone armor is the same. Curses has not been clicked on once, so we can't
[9239.72s -> 9247.06s]  go further down. But if you did, this weaken, which makes everybody that you touch with this do 33%
[9247.06s -> 9254.52s]  less damage. It's Iron Maiden, which when they do damage, it hurts themselves. It's a thorns.
[9255.16s -> 9261.02s]  So they do 200% damage returned back at them. Terror just makes people run away.
[9261.58s -> 9268.18s]  Nobody wants to do curses, apparently. So, and now that you see these, you know what they do.
[9268.82s -> 9275.00s]  Where would you like to go? This is for the first point, by the way. Please pick the category.
[9275.96s -> 9296.55s]  People are already clicking it. Hey, hey you. Hey you little, hey you little dork.
[9299.05s -> 9306.54s]  All right. Okay. We're on skeletons. We're on summoning spells already and that's where you
[9306.54s -> 9330.38s]  want to go. Which one? Skeleton mage is. So that's the first point. Where would you like the second
[9330.38s -> 9350.06s]  point? What a category. Or we just do it again. I guess we already know. I guess we already know.
[9350.86s -> 9358.79s]  Hey dude, great necro build. This actually is not even that different than just making a
[9358.79s -> 9369.00s]  summoning build anyway, so not too big of a problem. Okay. We're doing another point into
[9369.00s -> 9375.35s]  skeleton mage. See, a lot of you guys think you're doing some crazy weird impossible build,
[9375.91s -> 9379.11s]  but you're just going to make it hard for me to beat bosses, and then I have to figure it out on
[9379.11s -> 9393.64s]  my own. So we've got skeletal mage. One. Skeletal. Uh oh. We have to be level 13 for this one. Uh oh.
[9393.64s -> 9419.03s]  Pick something else. Now you could save points too. You don't have to spend them until you figure
[9419.03s -> 9429.16s]  out what you want to do. You don't have to spend them right now. We can do curses. Okay.
[9430.28s -> 9434.52s]  Don't influence us. I'm just saying, you don't have to spend your points until maybe you figure
[9434.52s -> 9442.95s]  out what you want to do. You don't have to spend every point. All right. So just to refresh your
[9442.95s -> 9450.60s]  memory because this is an inaccurate list. Very currently available curses. Invision and amplify
[9450.60s -> 9456.90s]  damage. Everything takes a hundred percent more damage or make them so they can't see very well.
[9457.46s -> 9483.94s]  Any mountain fans in the area? Curses equal lame. Well, it depends how you use them.
[9484.74s -> 9498.34s]  This actually will be very, very good. Okay. Good choice. And I mean that, actually, I don't mean
[9498.34s -> 9507.13s]  that as a joke. That's actually a really good thing to have with summoning build. Put on the bar. I've
[9507.13s -> 9521.80s]  got a couple things to put on the bar. So we're going to do F1, F3, F4. Okay. We have a skeletal
[9521.80s -> 9526.92s]  mage. Now we can summon, which is a different button. I'm also going to go P. So let's take
[9526.92s -> 9530.28s]  a quick little break for the first time. I'll be right back and we'll continue.
[9749.30s -> 9951.61s]  Okay. Sorry about that. Take care of Otto. Make sure he was doing okay.
[9952.89s -> 9963.59s]  All right. We've selected everything, right? I'm going to keep an eye on him. He's my special boy.
[9963.59s -> 9982.94s]  All right. All right. What was on tap here? I don't remember.
[9984.06s -> 9995.53s]  I'm Dario. Greetings. When I fled the monastery, my enchanted smithing hammer. If you can retrieve
[9995.53s -> 10005.43s]  it for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen your equipment. Okay. So it's so odd seeing this as a
[10005.43s -> 10011.03s]  fucking necromancer. Oh, we did that one. We could do this, but nah, we don't need it.
[10012.23s -> 10021.42s]  This is on the way. Idiot streamer sucks at Diablo. We got to get...
[10028.20s -> 10032.12s]  I need... Okay. We got to go from here to here. It's going to be quite a journey.
[10033.18s -> 10040.28s]  Do all quests with an angry face. We don't need... I'll go back and do them.
[10051.27s -> 10060.98s]  I'm looking for the... What is it called? The black marsh? That's the one. Oh, a ring.
[10065.78s -> 10073.56s]  Yeah. Light radius and attack rating. That's good. Why are there so many skeletons? Well, because
[10076.18s -> 10077.94s]  chat wants to have chat on screen.
[10079.94s -> 10085.66s]  There's going to be a bunch of them. Somebody redeemed a wing.
[10086.22s -> 10118.76s]  Hey, no, they didn't. Not right now. Did they? Did they? Oh, it was fucking fake. God damn it.
[10121.99s -> 10124.63s]  I need to... I need a way to track that on my own screen. Seriously.
[10126.60s -> 10130.12s]  I have to... I guess I gotta track that. Otherwise people will just keep doing that forever.
[10130.92s -> 10140.78s]  All right. With me, with me, with me, with me, with me. Black marsh. We're making a run for it.
[10143.22s -> 10148.82s]  Read the chat. But when there's 5,000 people in the chat room.
[10149.62s -> 10159.45s]  Somebody redeems a wink and one second goes by. It might be off the screen. I need a way to keep
[10159.45s -> 10189.80s]  track of it. Oh, look, there's another one. Oh, really? No way. Come on, run on the edge.
[10195.43s -> 10203.62s]  No, there was no real wink. I would have saw it. It'll show up on my dashboard. Is that for real?
[10206.12s -> 10226.60s]  Where? Reward requests? Is that it? Okay. Reward request is currently on. I don't see anything.
[10231.78s -> 10238.34s]  Don't ever alt tab during a hardcore game. Seriously, I'm gonna... I wonder if he's gonna
[10238.34s -> 10243.14s]  die to Andariel. No, no, no. I'm gonna alt tab and die to a one random person hitting me.
[10244.02s -> 10260.30s]  All right. It's up there. I didn't bring very many of these. I only got one.
[10262.50s -> 10270.78s]  I'm gonna go buy more of those. I'm gonna spend like all my money on it. Great. At least I have
[10270.78s -> 10278.44s]  an army protecting me. Yeah, that's true. But if I go too far ahead of the army and they don't
[10278.44s -> 10295.35s]  teleport quick enough, I'm gonna die. I have to go Black Marsh, right? Yes. Now, you really should
[10295.35s -> 10302.39s]  get the waypoint, but the only waypoint that matters is Catacombs level two. But this is
[10302.39s -> 10307.19s]  hardcore and you can't just die. So I'm gonna just hold on. I'm gonna relax for a second.
[10324.34s -> 10339.18s]  Ooh, that's pretty good. Lightning and Poison Resist. Block rate, 35% chance to block. Oh,
[10340.14s -> 10347.82s]  I can't really use it. When's the Paladin Scepter? I gotta use that. Wait, that's a Necromancer only
[10347.82s -> 10360.23s]  item. No plus to skills, so it's absolutely worthless. I keep going. Is that a waypoint?
[10362.55s -> 10377.13s]  Oh, you leveled up. Remember, there's a bug on your camera. Oh, oh, fucking ew.
[10377.69s -> 10397.08s]  Hey, look, the waypoint. All right, outer cloister. I think it's over. Kill the bug, kill the bug,
[10397.08s -> 10404.36s]  kill the bug. No, this bug's gonna live. You guys ever do that? You guys ever have a bug in your
[10404.36s -> 10408.34s]  house? Like a spider or something? And it's in a spot where, you know, it's probably not gonna
[10408.34s -> 10413.77s]  bother you. And you just go, all right, man, you can stay, you get to live. You stay there.
[10417.02s -> 10423.37s]  You can just hang out up there, but don't do any encroachment. The further you come out with that
[10423.37s -> 10429.05s]  web, the more chance there is that I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking get rid of it. All right, that's
[10429.61s -> 10443.74s]  this is the lightning lightning lightning lightning. Careful. Oh, fucking people are dying.
[10444.38s -> 10454.38s]  I'm so, oh, that's good. That's really good. Come on, plus the skills, plus the skills,
[10461.56s -> 10472.12s]  plus two to corpse explosion, plus one to weaken. All right, but I lose my actual damage. Hold on,
[10472.12s -> 10485.05s]  I'll look at that later. We're gonna get into the scales. I'm gonna kill people around you.
[10486.33s -> 10503.05s]  Why am I doing such a little damage to you? All right, speaking of damage, I gotta be doing
[10503.05s -> 10508.87s]  that way more often. Amplified damage, two to forty damage is a hell of a range. Yeah, and it is.
[10509.91s -> 10518.76s]  It is. Portal shrine, great portal. I'll take it.
[10518.76s -> 10538.41s]  But range damage really can kill you without, I guess, look at everybody with my true friend.
[10541.21s -> 10548.36s]  Love the bone squad we got going on right now. The ever increasing, what I got, six people.
[10552.20s -> 10562.95s]  I do feel a lot safer having six friends. Yeah, I can't play it online, but I can play with my
[10562.95s -> 10572.68s]  pretend friends here. All right, monastery gate. This place has the stale demons about it.
[10575.13s -> 10587.27s]  Sucks. I can't carry anymore. Oh, wait. All right, give her this.
[10590.04s -> 10604.33s]  Talk it. Who cares about the man? This dude's been playing since the beta. Yeah, dude.
[10606.49s -> 10609.45s]  This shit actually does get dangerous in here. This is like one of the first parts of the game
[10609.45s -> 10616.17s]  that you can actually get truly, truly, truly. A lot of tiny little corridors,
[10617.05s -> 10623.46s]  a lot of random people that just run through. Let's just stay alive. That's all it's about.
[10631.29s -> 10645.91s]  I do have to keep reminding myself that this is hardcore. Can't just have to be careful.
[10645.91s -> 10665.64s]  Okay, there's a demon up there. We still got all of our friends, right? Yep. All right. Move.
[10666.44s -> 10675.27s]  Move up. Move up. Let's move. Move. Move up. Is this being revived by?
[10677.70s -> 10687.00s]  Where is he? All right. I just was going to say, oh, thank God I got that in case I die.
[10687.64s -> 10702.06s]  That's not how this works. Easy. Hold up. We're going to hold off on leveling up for a minute.
[10702.70s -> 10709.93s]  I want to keep getting in. Hey, just in case I die, I'll be able to run back.
[10710.73s -> 10716.89s]  No, you won't, because that's where the game ends.
[10719.16s -> 10724.68s]  The butcher, too, might kill me. No, I have to get through three sacks.
[10725.80s -> 10738.06s]  Otherwise, what the hell? Lost my mage.
[10750.41s -> 10767.21s]  When are you going to do Sea Man 2? Is this Sea Man 2? Wait, isn't that one Japanese only?
[10768.17s -> 10782.30s]  And then only come out in Japan? Play it out. There's no English version of it.
[10792.12s -> 10797.43s]  You know where I really think I'm going to have a huge problem? The Arcane Sanctuary.
[10801.16s -> 10811.69s]  That's the worst place in the whole game. If you don't play the Arcane Sanctuary with at least
[10811.69s -> 10831.86s]  four people, life sucks. Okay, easy. The barracks. I'm just running around sniping the Shaman.
[10832.34s -> 10838.46s]  What? What the fuck? How did I take that much damage?
[10854.09s -> 10867.06s]  You weren't here earlier. My account is fucking damaged. I want them to go in first.
[10867.06s -> 10879.05s]  I hate these little doors. Back up, back up, back up, back up. This is the worst,
[10879.05s -> 10895.14s]  because you can just open a door and get hit three times and die. Are we good? 22 gold, 23 gold.
[10900.20s -> 10909.11s]  Looking for the jail level one. Okay, back up.
[10912.86s -> 10930.12s]  All right. Yeah, I'm starting to get a little clenched. Just a little. All it takes is one
[10930.12s -> 10946.49s]  person. We got some, that's a lot of money. Hold on a second. I got to do something about this.
[10954.50s -> 10972.34s]  What about one guy? A lot of potions left. Sell the miners. This is such a weird build.
[10973.14s -> 10979.30s]  I have way more potions than I need. Why are all these rejuvenation potions dropping?
[10979.30s -> 10987.24s]  I don't remember this being a thing. It feels weird and new. Why are there so many rejuvenation
[10987.24s -> 11018.58s]  potions? This over here. I'm going to store this. Use them for the cube. That is right. All right,
[11018.58s -> 11026.17s]  what we got for skill points here? We've unlocked Iron Maiden. I'm just saying. We've unlocked it.
[11026.17s -> 11029.53s]  Here are the, we have summoning spells. We still have the same amount.
[11030.41s -> 11039.91s]  And then here's the poison bone. One point in teeth. Don't worry, it's not useless or anything.
[11040.55s -> 11074.33s]  All right, where are we going? He's got one tooth. It's like we're staying in the summoning tree.
[11075.53s -> 11088.06s]  Everyone's got one good can opening tooth. All right, well, what are we doing in here?
[11088.06s -> 11091.66s]  And by the way, if you put another point into golem, it does not give you two golems.
[11091.66s -> 11095.50s]  It just makes your one golem much better. I want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[11096.46s -> 11121.08s]  Germa one golem. Second skeletal mage. It's golem. I know, but ever since I was like 15
[11121.08s -> 11125.96s]  playing this game, I just, I say golem. I know. All right, that's the thanks for voting. That's,
[11125.96s -> 11141.10s]  there's no way anything's coming back from that. And what about stats? Is it bogus voting or am I
[11141.10s -> 11148.22s]  unable to vote because of mobile? I don't think extensions work on mobile. I think that's probably
[11148.22s -> 11166.74s]  what's going on. Some do. Yeah. Vitality. Still no points in decks, but that's a,
[11168.02s -> 11171.86s]  actually that's, that's probably going to be a bad thing. It is this many points in strength already.
[11173.14s -> 11182.17s]  Vitality. Thanks for voting. With this many points. Yeah. All right, we're going to get a
[11182.73s -> 11193.64s]  second skeleton mage. Cool. And what was it? Vitality, right? Yeah. 26 dexterity.
[11194.44s -> 11205.29s]  All right. Five points. If I was a barbarian or something or no, this is a terrible build,
[11205.29s -> 11222.02s]  whoever you are. Okay. Make sure I've got everybody. One, two, three, four. So I got seven
[11222.02s -> 11243.94s]  companions. So it's going to start to get messy very quickly. It's almost broken. All right.
[11243.94s -> 11258.12s]  Yell up on the mini map. You see a, okay, something's in here. The only way to play hardcore
[11259.08s -> 11272.22s]  the guy who watches. Ooh, skullcap. All of them's in there. Everyone's alive still. So this is okay.
[11281.75s -> 11288.44s]  I want to check that skullcap. Everyone's still alive. We're fine. Let's take a look.
[11291.69s -> 11298.30s]  Better six to energy. That's pretty useful. And lightning resist. Yeah. Put it on. It's better.
[11299.26s -> 11322.33s]  Straight up. All right. Stay with me. What level am I? I'm 13. Potentially a little underleveled
[11322.33s -> 11331.19s]  for what is happening in the next section here. But, you know, sometimes you got to go for it.
[11332.07s -> 11355.27s]  I know you're 13. Yeah. You have to grind. I haven't had too much of a problem yet.
[11356.23s -> 11360.89s]  Once, if this starts to become a problem, this is still on player's set of four.
[11361.77s -> 11366.31s]  Yeah, it's at least three or four. If this becomes a problem, then I will grind.
[11366.31s -> 11385.37s]  Is that a ring? Almost. It's playing hardcore and Diablo foolish if you've never played it before.
[11387.02s -> 11394.52s]  Uh, yes. It's so easy to accidentally die in these games by just some random explosion
[11395.40s -> 11398.04s]  or some random champion enemy that's going to be once you die.
[11399.00s -> 11404.12s]  Okay. Speaking of kind of an insane room, uh, people are dying.
[11406.10s -> 11414.87s]  People are getting cream. What is, what is cream and everybody? Oh my God. People are dead.
[11415.59s -> 11427.29s]  Get up here. Up, up, up, back out, back up, back up. Golem's dead. No, it's not the Smith.
[11430.79s -> 11433.99s]  Okay. I'm sorry. I just get this shit at everybody. That was a mistake.
[11433.99s -> 11442.79s]  I forgot that what that did. There's something in here. What is in here? That's causing so much
[11442.79s -> 11451.85s]  damage. They're all down the corner. Oh, this is, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[11451.85s -> 11459.86s]  This is where it ends. This is where it ends. All right. Maybe it's time to grind. There's like five
[11459.86s -> 11484.73s]  champions down there in the corner. I can't see everybody. Okay. Okay. This is bad. This is bad.
[11484.73s -> 11489.61s]  Let them come to us. All right. Just, all right, Larry, it's just me and you. I got to move. We
[11489.61s -> 11503.08s]  have to leave. I got to get out. Okay. Now we have to do the fun thing called be a necromancer. Uh,
[11503.08s -> 11505.56s]  we're going to go out to the blood more and we're going to get a full party again.
[11506.28s -> 11518.07s]  That's a wink. There is no wink. No, there's no, I, I can look, I can see it now. Yes, there is. No,
[11518.07s -> 11533.51s]  there isn't. I'm looking right now. It was a scam. I like identifying on the fly. Even it's a waste
[11533.51s -> 11554.25s]  of money. I know. Okay. All right. Let's, uh, get some new friends. Oh, gamble. I might in a second
[11557.58s -> 11561.75s]  and repair. Yep. Refilling shrine. Just do it. That almost was very bad.
[11562.55s -> 11572.62s]  Just give me some, I need to just build my army back up before I go back in the door for them to
[11572.62s -> 11581.94s]  instantly die. Is that seriously the only body that's around here? How can that be the only body?
[11582.66s -> 11603.72s]  There's going to be a German wink market correction soon. Probably. All right. Den of evil. I was in
[11603.72s -> 11619.67s]  there already. We just do two more things. Come on. Manor recharge station. Yeah, there's that. We
[11619.75s -> 11639.93s]  have our Golem and now we have, see one more of these. In fact, I used them. That's all right.
[11642.26s -> 11648.54s]  It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. I almost had a panic attack. In fact,
[11648.54s -> 11655.69s]  this is better because then I can, I can, yeah, this is fine. I didn't repair. I will, I will,
[11655.69s -> 11665.13s]  I will. After I get through these dickheads up here, we got to go slow and I got to run in the
[11665.13s -> 11670.14s]  room. No, we have to have the, the Golem has to go in the room first. I ain't going in there first.
[11681.54s -> 11691.64s]  Where is it? The shithouse has to go in there first. There they are. All right. Get them. Get in.
[11691.64s -> 11698.97s]  Everybody in. Everybody get in. Kill. Holy fuck. There's still a lot of people in there.
[11700.01s -> 11709.37s]  We good? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
[11710.25s -> 11716.60s]  I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Kill this guy. Good. Overwhelm them. Overwhelm.
[11717.40s -> 11742.17s]  Golem's doing a good job. Nice. Everyone's fine. All right. Kill him. He's pounding him right.
[11742.73s -> 11760.12s]  All right. Nice job. That was almost a disaster. Almost a disaster. A second time.
[11762.65s -> 11789.03s]  What have we got? Almost level up. Everyone's okay. We continue. Found it. Yeah. Level one.
[11792.50s -> 11804.10s]  Safe. The slow torture of caged starvation. Okay. I'm going to, where's, uh, is that really in such
[11804.10s -> 11817.29s]  a stupid place that I can't click on it? Did I really do that to myself? The order welcomes you.
[11818.17s -> 11833.34s]  I'm going to go gamble too. I'm not going to repair. It's a lot of money.
[11834.14s -> 11843.42s]  Try to get some heavy armor. Well, this chain gloves, which are probably better than what I
[11843.42s -> 11865.99s]  have. How much? It's too expensive. Couldn't be much worse. I'm all right. It's not terrible.
[11866.55s -> 11872.94s]  I have more defense now. Does he know that it's not pronounced? It's pronounced dual. It's not dual
[11872.94s -> 11883.19s]  weld. Yeah. I know it's wield. Dual wield. Dual weld is easier for me to say. Dual welding. Dual
[11883.19s -> 11898.68s]  welding. Dual welding. Dual wielding. All right. We're just going to level up. I think that's good.
[11898.68s -> 11915.30s]  Let's go back in. I'm prepared. Dual weld. Golem. Bad. All right. Place your bets actually.
[11916.10s -> 11919.14s]  I want to know real opinions. Do you guys think I'm going to beat Andariel?
[11920.34s -> 11925.66s]  Do you think I'm going to? How do we figure this out? How do we do like an actual
[11925.66s -> 11945.72s]  figure this out test? Heavy gloves. There it is.
[11957.26s -> 11961.38s]  Are you okay? Like, hold on. I'll actually have to pause again.
[11962.58s -> 11999.99s]  I'm going to help him. He needs like a blanket. Hold on. He has this, uh,
[12000.95s -> 12010.07s]  you got a cone. We got him one of the soft cones, you know, things so he doesn't get his stitches.
[12011.11s -> 12016.28s]  So, but he can kind of get stuck. Then when the, when the cone, because it's a soft cone,
[12016.84s -> 12023.18s]  it can press down and he's like, eh, I need to help him sometimes. That was a real wink.
[12026.15s -> 12032.57s]  It really was. That was actually, okay. That actual, yeah, you're right. It did. You're right.
[12032.65s -> 12052.49s]  Here. Thanks a lot. The prophecy has been fulfilled. How are we doing? Dude, fucking,
[12052.49s -> 12054.65s]  I can't wait to kill Andariel first try.
[12056.81s -> 12091.96s]  Losing. Stay back. Too bad that's not a weapon. It's Paladin only. So I guess I could save it.
[12091.96s -> 12102.36s]  Hold on. Six. So many potions. Do they like up the amount of potions you can have?
[12103.32s -> 12107.98s]  I swear to God, the last time I played this, there wasn't this many potions available.
[12110.44s -> 12129.48s]  Don't keep picking those. Bring jail level two. All right. Easy. Easy. Easy.
[12132.57s -> 12145.24s]  Skill shrine. I might be able to get more skeletons with that. Six, four and a third. Yeah. A third.
[12145.24s -> 12162.50s]  Okay. Almost at the inner cloister. Almost at a major boss of the game.
[12163.62s -> 12181.00s]  Close there. There are so many potions because the game is trying to drop enough of the three
[12181.00s -> 12193.98s]  players you have. You're a hacker. I guess that's true. Get antidote potions. I know. I know. I've
[12193.98s -> 12198.86s]  played the video game. I know Andariel's got poisoned and you have to be careful
[12199.82s -> 12202.78s]  because it'll kill you. That's gonna be I'm gonna be so terrified.
[12204.14s -> 12212.30s]  You guys want to know something about this? Here's a true story. I have never once and I truly mean
[12212.30s -> 12219.02s]  ever over the course of thousands and thousands and thousands of hours across Diablo one through
[12219.02s -> 12227.19s]  Diablo three. Thousands. Thousands of hours. I've never played one single character on hardcore.
[12227.19s -> 12235.46s]  This is the first time you're ever going to see this. Never taken a shower. I have never ever
[12235.46s -> 12245.08s]  taken a shower. Hardcore to me was always too stressful because there's so many ways to die
[12245.08s -> 12249.64s]  in these games that especially when you get onto a higher difficulty like nightmare of hell,
[12249.64s -> 12257.62s]  you can die in one one hit just from something across the room. I hated it. I hated taking showers.
[12262.36s -> 12285.02s]  What level am I? 14? Not bad. You guys going first. Thank god you guys selected amplify damage.
[12285.90s -> 12306.82s]  Come on. Get in there. Get in there. Let's go. What the hell are you doing? Dude 14? What? Are
[12306.82s -> 12331.18s]  you serious? Yeah. I'm dead. Am I wearing a bathing suit? Why would I be wearing a bathing suit?
[12332.14s -> 12361.37s]  Will somebody kill somebody over here, please? I can't even see who's over here. This thing's
[12361.37s -> 12373.37s]  gonna explode. I think these explode, right? Do eight players or riot? No, I'm on four right now.
[12374.01s -> 12385.48s]  Do you have level two? Come on. No, it's not over there. It's down here.
[12389.30s -> 12411.05s]  Here's 99. I mean, if I do players eight, I'll level up faster, but
[12412.01s -> 12426.86s]  it's too dangerous. That's way too dangerous. Level two. This game is 20 fucking years old.
[12429.34s -> 12444.44s]  Very old. I'm gonna get dangerous. No, no, I can't let it end like that. I'm gonna put it on eight
[12444.44s -> 12448.76s]  players and die. And then I'm gonna sit there and go, why did I? What's the point of that?
[12449.88s -> 12460.30s]  What? To make myself look cool? Attack rating 15 to 10. Yeah, that's better. Poison resist.
[12460.86s -> 12471.58s]  I need poison resist. The good thing about this is about this hardcore run. If this character dies,
[12471.58s -> 12476.41s]  you're not going to care about losing them. Yeah, that's that's pretty good way to put it.
[12476.41s -> 12483.90s]  That's not that's not a bad way to look at it. Don't put eight until after and aerial. Yeah.
[12484.46s -> 12488.14s]  Plus, I might get some really good items from an aerial. Hopefully, hopefully I get at least
[12488.14s -> 12499.26s]  one or two unique. That's the real goal here. When you see that first that the gold text drop.
[12499.90s -> 12505.96s]  Oh, it's like I wonder what that's going to be. Be careful.
[12512.70s -> 12523.53s]  All right. Stone skin demon. Amplify that damage. Just stay over there. Try to get a set. Well,
[12523.53s -> 12528.09s]  once I get the waypoint, I can do an aerial run and just try to get a couple of cool items
[12528.09s -> 12538.94s]  before I get killed and active. I'm still alive. All right. Hang up on
[12546.47s -> 12550.49s]  no. Give me some. Give me anything. Stuttered leather. Hold on.
[12554.09s -> 12556.49s]  No, go back and sell. Look at all this crap.
[12570.74s -> 12572.98s]  They had to. They did something weird with these potions.
[12572.98s -> 12590.84s]  They actually did patch this. This is a lot. They patched it on Otto's birthday. Oh, that's nice of
[12590.84s -> 12608.47s]  them. It's even in the stash. Nothing. All right. Six and six. That's fine. Jail level two. Oh,
[12608.47s -> 12615.91s]  OK. What happened? Good. I don't know why, but that I got the same reaction for that. That if
[12615.91s -> 12618.07s]  my character died in hardcore, I don't know why I thought something happened.
[12618.07s -> 12645.02s]  I'm going to be able to level up twice here. Probably better than pausing the game for like
[12645.02s -> 12652.84s]  five, 10 minutes. Hey, Vaude, Jerma is going to die soon. What's your prediction? Yeah,
[12652.84s -> 12655.16s]  I mean, you've got to get what you can't say. You've got to get prediction after that.
[12656.36s -> 12667.26s]  Right. You can't just say soon. When? Give us time. When? 15 minutes from right now.
[12668.30s -> 12673.50s]  So it's with three hours and 32 minutes into the stream. So in three hours and 47 minutes.
[12674.62s -> 12697.72s]  OK, we'll see. As long as they have an army, I might be OK. He just opened the door by himself.
[12699.56s -> 12702.44s]  You've got to let dad open the doors. Don't open doors for no reason.
[12703.32s -> 12720.94s]  I have to be in control of that. Once we get to the interclusters, I'm going to start to
[12721.42s -> 12733.86s]  kill. This game is actually kind of scary. Yeah, a little three. What is that? Resist fire. Sure.
[12734.74s -> 12744.38s]  I'll take it. It makes me take 75 percent less damage than fire. I think. Although I've never
[12744.38s -> 12750.57s]  really known what that does. I've been promising the green screen since November. What's the hold
[12750.57s -> 12760.25s]  up? Those of you that don't know, I have costochondritis, which means I can't move around that
[12760.25s -> 12769.85s]  much. And until I find a solution for that problem, I cannot jump around and fly around
[12769.85s -> 12772.73s]  and do the things that I want to do in front of that green screen. I'm I got hold on. I got to
[12772.73s -> 12785.05s]  apply damage on me. So it might include a few things. I might have to have surgery on a hernia
[12785.05s -> 12791.05s]  and I might have to get an injection of steroids. But pretty much the only way you treat it.
[12791.77s -> 12796.60s]  Unfortunately, this is going to be really bad. So I have to focus here.
[12796.68s -> 12811.06s]  Oh, don't kill me. Why can't you guys be fired? All right. So the guy that said this is going to
[12811.06s -> 12817.40s]  end in 12 minutes, how dare you spawn these enemies here? Go in, like physically go in the door.
[12818.98s -> 12840.92s]  Get in there. Somebody go in. Go inside. All right. Kill. Fight. Mage. Mage. Mage.
[12855.48s -> 12857.72s]  Why do you get to have amplified damage, too? It's not fair.
[12857.88s -> 12893.51s]  All right. Slowly, but surely get in here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Where's my goal? Oh, I need somebody.
[12893.51s -> 12903.54s]  I need somebody. I need somebody. I need somebody. I need somebody. Back up. Any corpses?
[12905.69s -> 12913.35s]  No, you got it. You got to get in there, man. You got to get in there.
[12914.07s -> 12919.82s]  Come with me. You got to get in here. Get in there. He's coming to us. He's coming to us.
[12920.78s -> 12932.92s]  Look at his health. Inside of the gate. In the gate. Get in the gate. You're just getting hit for
[12932.92s -> 12951.45s]  free. Thank you. At least somebody has a brain. Get in. What if he explodes? All right. I'm ready.
[12951.45s -> 12966.06s]  I'm ready with another golem. It's too scary to do this on my own. He just low-key called them dumb.
[12967.02s -> 12977.77s]  Well, yeah. He's kind of dumb. He's going to explode into cold. I know it. I'm staying all
[12977.77s -> 12993.91s]  the way back here. Did I low-key say it or did I just say it? Come on. One more. Hit him. Yep.
[12993.91s -> 13008.68s]  Okay. I knew that was going to happen. Nice work, you two. You did it. Okay. I've got to kill like
[13008.68s -> 13020.82s]  two more things and level up. No corpses over here. Promote that golem to iron. I probably will. Well,
[13020.82s -> 13027.30s]  actually, no, I won't because it's not my decision. Don't let me influence you.
[13028.18s -> 13032.18s]  I'm going to have two levels up here.
[13037.94s -> 13054.50s]  Second level up. I don't want them to... If they're ice, they explode. That's terrible because I can't
[13054.50s -> 13075.48s]  turn them into corpses after that. These characters ruin the purity of the bone.
[13084.82s -> 13096.84s]  Cool. Level up. I will. I will. I will. I'm going to put this down.
[13096.84s -> 13126.23s]  I just want to get to jail level three. Got everybody? Yes. Jail up here. All right. Don't
[13126.23s -> 13136.62s]  even fight that. That's just... That's just death. I think it might be in here.
[13139.21s -> 13163.48s]  I knew it was down here. Jail level three. All right. Time to level up. We've got two
[13163.48s -> 13170.06s]  levels up. I'm going to put 10 points in. Where should we put our 10 points? Time for you guys
[13170.06s -> 13196.94s]  to make a good decision here. We got 10. You're looking a bit low. I'm talking about coffee,
[13196.94s -> 13215.99s]  Cheetos, and what? I'm actually not sure where that is being clicked. No, no, no. That's terrible.
[13216.71s -> 13229.10s]  That's the worst thing I could put 10 points in right now. It actually is the worst. You need hit
[13229.10s -> 13250.22s]  chance. Imagine putting one point in dexterity. Get influenced. Hey, get influenced. Get influenced.
[13250.22s -> 13280.33s]  10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Done. Vitality. 10 points in. What? Done. Look at that. 39%. Thanks a lot,
[13280.33s -> 13294.18s]  guys. Ah, I feel so much safer. All right. We have two points to put in, but we have
[13295.14s -> 13302.07s]  essentially some new shit to look at here. Ray Skeleton. Skeleton Mastery. Make it better
[13302.07s -> 13314.14s]  skeleton. Make Clay Golem a little better or make it plus 20% health. Skeletal Mage is a third
[13314.14s -> 13322.38s]  skeleton permanently. We don't have enough to go down yet. That one point in teeth is just so,
[13322.38s -> 13332.79s]  it's haunting me. Or we have, again, amplify damage. Also keep in mind putting a second
[13332.79s -> 13340.79s]  point in amplify damage does not make it do more. It's always 100%. It just makes the radius bigger
[13340.79s -> 13349.62s]  so you don't have to cast. It gives you a much huge wide area and duration. All of them. So,
[13349.62s -> 13358.94s]  Iron Maiden is, I believe Iron Maiden does go up. Explosion is here. Still have not picked anything
[13358.94s -> 13365.50s]  in this really, besides some of you just making a joke a few hours ago. And then again, take a look
[13365.50s -> 13370.90s]  at what you have available for summoning. All right. Where do you guys want to go?
[13388.54s -> 13400.60s]  Summoning looks like not a bad choice. Where would you like to go inside of that?
[13401.64s -> 13425.88s]  Summoning memes are so 2019. We have another point to put in, so this is the first one. What
[13425.88s -> 13429.99s]  about the second one? We'll take a look what it looks like afterwards. All right, here we go.
[13430.79s -> 13438.38s]  Skeleton Mage. Some of you want to do a better golem, which I don't disagree with you. Not a
[13438.38s -> 13443.80s]  bad choice. What are you going to do with the 43% of these guys? Trying to put a, well,
[13443.80s -> 13450.17s]  third Skeleton Mage is good too. I'm fucking into this. I'm beating Andariel first try.
[13457.24s -> 13460.04s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All
[13460.04s -> 13470.74s]  right. All right. Let's go. Third Skeleton Mage. We have enough. By the way, keep in mind.
[13472.26s -> 13481.34s]  This is going to make them stronger defense-wise, but it's not going to add another Mage. See,
[13481.34s -> 13489.58s]  take a look. Take a look and see what it does. Make sure you're certain of what you want to do.
[13489.58s -> 13511.98s]  Residence Sleeper actually making a real build. But are they though? You know what I mean? I mean,
[13511.98s -> 13518.09s]  it could be kind of. All right. You see, you know, you know what's available. I don't have to show
[13518.09s -> 13527.91s]  you again. I will very much implore you to open up a Diablo two skill calculator and go to
[13527.91s -> 13533.85s]  Necromancer. You can take a look on your own time, you know, so I don't know if we can,
[13533.85s -> 13540.50s]  you can be certain of what you want. No, no, no, no. All right. Jesus. Just give me a suggestion.
[13540.50s -> 13549.72s]  What the fuck? All right. Where are we going? I would do that. Why would I do that? I just click
[13549.72s -> 13592.74s]  on X. Okay. Summoning it is. Silence. Summoning it is. What are we doing in summoning?
[13599.96s -> 13609.53s]  Real build. Real build. What is this real build? I wanted to do 20 points into dim vision. Why?
[13610.65s -> 13621.72s]  No, he's going to kill Andariel. You had an opportunity and you didn't take it.
[13625.50s -> 13631.88s]  I actually completely I have to apologize to you guys. I was under the impression that you
[13631.88s -> 13638.76s]  were going to put one point into skeletons and then 20 points into skeleton mastery.
[13639.72s -> 13648.44s]  I thought you were going to do 20 points into teeth. I you know, you've got you guys are
[13648.44s -> 13659.14s]  actually working pretty well right now. Let's get all the mastery. I don't want to give you
[13659.14s -> 13673.61s]  any ideas, but we're already going on a build here. Okay. All mastery. Let's go. Which as you see,
[13674.49s -> 13679.13s]  life is at 100. This is an attack bonus. Take a look at the attack. It's at 20.
[13679.85s -> 13689.61s]  So he's at 80 and 100. Let's do a bang. So he's got 120 health. The attack is a little bit better.
[13689.61s -> 13698.70s]  He's just going to live a lot longer. He walks a lot faster too. You're doing cuck at build.
[13717.88s -> 13721.67s]  This is literally the build I did in middle school.
[13722.47s -> 13734.55s]  Yeah. And guess what? It's fun to look at, but you'll see when we get to a boss,
[13735.75s -> 13741.61s]  it's only me. Well, who knows? They may have patched it. Here we go. Jail level three. Let's
[13741.61s -> 13750.90s]  do it. Thanks for voting. You guys won't even give me bone armor. If I'm going to be melee
[13752.79s -> 13756.47s]  necromancer, like you at least give me some defense.
[13759.29s -> 13785.56s]  Am I running faster? What? I feel like I'm faster. Kind of a suboptimal build. I would say.
[13785.56s -> 13792.38s]  Yeah. It's very suboptimal, but that's just the way it is. Now we get a champion down here.
[13810.70s -> 13824.52s]  Getting harder to kill things. Oh, that's right. I do it. I do another mage.
[13827.56s -> 13850.90s]  We got eight friends. Yeah. The Golem lasted a lot longer. Golem's name should be play.
[13852.02s -> 13858.89s]  Yeah. Well, the thing about the Golems in this game is if you beef them up,
[13859.45s -> 13864.33s]  they will survive at bosses and they will. It is just, it is just you watching somebody else play
[13864.33s -> 13870.66s]  the game. Just hypothetical. If you put, if you guys put like 20 points into the Golem shit,
[13871.46s -> 13874.58s]  we're going to be watching somebody else and watch somebody play a video game.
[13875.78s -> 13889.56s]  I will be the camera pointing at the Golem. Come on, Drew crew. Why can't he just be dead
[13889.56s -> 13896.73s]  in 10 seconds? So we can play Nancy Drew. That's not, that's not going to happen.
[13899.54s -> 13903.38s]  If I were to die in 10 seconds, we would have played a paperclip empire,
[13903.94s -> 13929.88s]  but whatever that thing was called, true, true, true. If we got a new crew, look at this crew.
[13929.88s -> 13972.44s]  You don't like this crew skeleton crew calcium crew. Come on. Milk mob battle.
[13973.32s -> 13983.21s]  Let's get so hectic. You don't even know who's on your team.
[13991.18s -> 13999.02s]  Once there's 10 skeletons, 15 skeletons and five different, it's just hard going on.
[14000.54s -> 14013.53s]  I got an item. I have like good items or what? Cool items. I haven't seen one.
[14020.14s -> 14025.67s]  Bones are made of solidified milk. This is where I die. Game over. This is game over. I lose.
[14026.63s -> 14039.86s]  Holy fuck. That was terrifying. Everybody in the bones equal frozen milk.
[14045.34s -> 14049.50s]  Yeah. I got to buy the portal. If I'm playing on hardcore, I got to find portal to something.
[14050.86s -> 14055.91s]  I'll just stand there and open up the inventory. All right. That's,
[14055.91s -> 14064.23s]  that's a lesson I need to learn right now. All right. I'm binding, uh, F five town portal.
[14064.79s -> 14065.75s]  Okay. Good to know.
[14075.77s -> 14081.30s]  They all run at you like that. I see that Adam Sandler got snubbed for best actor. I did.
[14082.66s -> 14112.26s]  It's a joke. I was actually getting a little nervous. I just heard the, uh,
[14113.06s -> 14121.74s]  blacksmith's voice line and gotten nervous. What did he say? He said, I will crush your bones to
[14121.74s -> 14142.49s]  dust. Something like that. I'm scared now. Don't open. What a room. Bad room.
[14145.62s -> 14149.80s]  We're doing a real life. Don't get stuck in there. Don't get stuck in there. I don't know.
[14157.62s -> 14167.08s]  Come on. Stay alive. I'm just the coach. Just a football coach.
[14175.43s -> 14182.87s]  He's lightning or what? Diamond. I'll take it. It's a teleporter.
[14182.87s -> 14195.40s]  Okay. Old enchanted. Are you seriously going to give me Paladin shields? Why? Give me anything
[14195.40s -> 14224.49s]  else. It sucks. That sucks. It's okay. It's all right. Diablo two. I was just paraphrasing.
[14225.37s -> 14228.57s]  That wasn't actually me actually doing. It wasn't paraphrasing. Found it.
[14230.12s -> 14248.46s]  All right. Inner cloister. Time to get scared. I'm so glad I'm not a potion find barbarian. This
[14248.46s -> 14258.18s]  would not have lasted very long. This would have been horrible. It might be going a little faster
[14258.18s -> 14263.67s]  if I was source first or something, but even still, I think that would be horrible as well.
[14264.55s -> 14281.82s]  This is just stupid and shitty enough to last long enough to have fun. Thanks for that.
[14281.82s -> 14297.91s]  It's because you are one. I am one. What? All right. This is kind of funny.
[14298.87s -> 14304.84s]  This is kind of funny. I'm going to put this on screen.
[14324.86s -> 14334.14s]  That's fun. This stream was worth it just for that.
[14334.94s -> 14338.60s]  Oh, whatever. I just want to do this. I think this is fun.
[14347.53s -> 14351.62s]  Plus two to the artist. All right. Here we go.
[14352.42s -> 14354.98s]  Uh, where's the waypoint? It's like right here somewhere. Isn't it?
[14354.98s -> 14368.44s]  Plus two to the artist. Minus two to me. I didn't say anything. Can't you just give
[14368.44s -> 14377.85s]  plus two to the artist? Why do I have to get a minus? That seems kind of unfair.
[14377.85s -> 14382.47s]  Inner cloister. There it is. All right. Time to get scared.
[14383.59s -> 14385.99s]  Seriously. Actually scared because this is the part with the
[14388.47s -> 14411.45s]  monastery barracks. I have a lot of friends over here. Is there no max level?
[14413.69s -> 14417.93s]  Uh, there is no max level. Wait, is it outer cloister? Wait, where is it?
[14421.50s -> 14429.05s]  I didn't know it's outer cloister. Isn't it? Yeah. It's the barracks. Okay.
[14432.70s -> 14436.22s]  Well, I'm going to do this because I want the, I want to be able to do the thing.
[14439.30s -> 14442.52s]  I'm free to die. I hope not.
[14446.04s -> 14458.04s]  Barracks. Okay. Yeah. I wasn't here before. All right. Uh, uh, I hate this. I hate hardcore.
[14458.04s -> 14464.30s]  I do any one of these doors. I'm just going to hear the voice line. It's going to get
[14464.30s -> 14467.58s]  the shit out of me. He's going to sprint at me. He's going to hit me once. I'm going to
[14467.58s -> 14486.62s]  hurt us. Here it is. I'm trying to get around. All right. Golem, tank them.
[14490.90s -> 14514.04s]  Still alive, right? I'm so paranoid. We bring this back to, uh, Charsey.
[14514.76s -> 14521.21s]  Things actually pretty good. I bring it back to Charsey and then we can
[14521.21s -> 14531.90s]  imbue any weapon in the game as long as it's white. We can make it magic. Good to see. Oh,
[14531.90s -> 14537.42s]  thanks so much for returning the Herodric Malice. I will now imbue one of your items
[14537.42s -> 14544.58s]  with magical powers. Thank you. Well, the idea here is you do not just do this for no reason.
[14545.46s -> 14550.82s]  You find something that's really high quality and you bring it, but you don't just want to
[14550.82s -> 14555.54s]  throw one. Oh, yeah. A random pair of socks. No, no, that would be terrible. So that would be
[14555.54s -> 14564.42s]  waste. Almost level up. It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the
[14564.42s -> 14571.54s]  rogue sisterhood and defiled their ancestral monastery. This does not bode well for us,
[14571.54s -> 14578.25s]  my friend. Yep, yep, yep. Kill Andariel. Find Andariel's lair in the depths of the monastery
[14578.25s -> 14585.91s]  catacombs. We are there. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's go.
[14586.71s -> 14596.02s]  I'm ready. We need to get the catacombs level two waypoint so I can farm for items if I want to.
[14597.14s -> 14603.22s]  Do not ever, under any circumstances, play Diablo 2 and not get the last waypoint. It would be a
[14603.22s -> 14609.06s]  mistake. Don't do it. I know some of you just want to run through, but we have to get that waypoint.
[14613.38s -> 14627.11s]  Worst mistake of my entire life. Oh my god, he's...
[14630.31s -> 14639.29s]  I would be so scared if I was doing this with anything else. Oh, there's a lot of people in
[14639.29s -> 14645.10s]  here. Slow, slow. Good thing I was... We got our first... Boys and girls, we got our first unique.
[14645.74s -> 14653.72s]  And a jewel. Oh, yes. Don't die. That's a unique over there. Uniques in this game are not like
[14653.72s -> 14660.90s]  Diablo 3. They're actually cool. It's not just like 700 strength, 700 intelligence, 750
[14661.94s -> 14676.97s]  health. No, they're actually cool. What is it? Oh my god. Our first fucking legendary.
[14678.97s -> 14689.51s]  I want to identify right now, but that's a mistake. 700 IQ glove. Player of the room,
[14689.51s -> 14694.36s]  don't be an idiot. Don't be a fucking idiot. No reason to put myself in danger.
[14697.50s -> 14704.30s]  Who's reviving? Where are you? Where's the shaman? Where's the shaman?
[14710.71s -> 14712.31s]  Okay, that's a champion.
[14733.78s -> 14735.14s]  Thank you, Coke Gaming.
[14737.38s -> 14744.74s]  It's so funny how that just became a thing randomly overnight. It really did. All right,
[14744.74s -> 14755.56s]  let's see. Heavy gloves. Pretty fucking good. Blood fist. 10% increased attack speed,
[14756.73s -> 14767.06s]  40 health, 10 defense, plus five to minimum damage. Let's see what this does when I put them on.
[14767.06s -> 14782.49s]  Look at the health. Ready? 150, 190, 30% faster hit recovery, which is huge. 40 health is huge.
[14784.20s -> 14799.78s]  Yep. Nice. Seems kind of bad. For a random, just normal act one, that's pretty good.
[14805.67s -> 14815.00s]  Big in my head. Bullshit gloves. Let's go to the catacomb.
[14821.64s -> 14831.53s]  You're not going to beat act two. Well, there's a way I'll beat act two. And that is I know it's
[14831.53s -> 14840.70s]  going to be me versus Doriel. Right? So I just have to grind until I have like 80 cold resistance.
[14840.70s -> 14848.79s]  It's just the only way. What about the maggot lair? Oh, man. I forgot about the maggot lair.
[14849.51s -> 14861.18s]  That might be the run ender. All right. Catacombs. It sucks. It's a really shitty jewel.
[14868.15s -> 14875.03s]  Like you're going to make it to the maggot lair. I think I'll make it to the maggot lair. I mean,
[14875.03s -> 14890.46s]  unless something really bad happens now. And we're going to find my screaming tomorrow. Yeah.
[14893.18s -> 14902.02s]  Another jewel. Doriel is going to kill 100%. I don't know. It's going to be tough.
[14903.70s -> 14922.73s]  This is better than what I have on. Nine to 15, one to 27. But I'm out of, I'm out of, um,
[14922.73s -> 14936.26s]  town portals. That's horrible. Okay. I can't go back to town. Don't they be paying attention to
[14936.26s -> 14963.86s]  that stuff? Stay back. I'm running dumb. If I identify that's not what I want, it's whatever
[14963.86s -> 14981.69s]  it means they're going to drop. Come on, scroll. Scroll the town portal. I can't be a rat man.
[14990.55s -> 15020.92s]  Are they alive? How am I overburdened? Oh, all right. Is this better? If I put, all right,
[15021.56s -> 15026.04s]  if I just put a bunch of dumb shit in here, three to four fire damage, can I make this better?
[15026.84s -> 15053.35s]  15, 16, 18. Fire resist and cast. No. Does Darryl have fire? No, it's poison. Is it poison and fire?
[15054.07s -> 15080.41s]  It might be. Town portal. There it is. Yes, poison. Okay. It sells junk. Junk, junk, junk, junk, junk.
[15081.13s -> 15086.02s]  This shit is junk too. Yeah. It's taking up too much space. Get the hell out of here.
[15086.02s -> 15101.64s]  It really is. It's taking up too much space. This guy's a psycho. What did I do? This guy's a psycho.
[15106.44s -> 15121.16s]  14,000. Should I gamble? Maybe. Yeah, we'll level up. I'm going to need to do it every time.
[15122.28s -> 15143.75s]  All right. I need, I'm looking for, I need armor. All right. What's the worst thing I possibly,
[15143.75s -> 15154.15s]  what's the worst thing I have on me? These boots suck. Three. This belt sucks. Everything kind of
[15154.15s -> 15163.61s]  sucks. The boots are probably the worst though. What do you need? I don't need gloves anymore for
[15163.61s -> 15195.32s]  a while. Claymore. Boots. Boots. Geed, come on. Better belt. It's going to be another slot.
[15195.96s -> 15219.50s]  Where are the boots? Anything. Geed, come on. Here we go. Heavy boots. They're still awful.
[15220.14s -> 15228.65s]  Why level four of all the things? I'm so focused on this game. You won't notice. Yes, I do.
[15237.38s -> 15253.11s]  All right. Chain boots. Bad. I can do this like one more time. I don't want to completely
[15253.11s -> 15274.28s]  broke our chain boots. Come on. Rare. Well, that didn't work out. Here are the points at this point.
[15275.08s -> 15299.27s]  Where am I putting these stats? Take a look. Okay, here we go. What does dexterity do? It makes you
[15299.27s -> 15306.15s]  hit more. It increases your attack rating and technically your defense, but it makes it so
[15306.15s -> 15315.06s]  you hit more. Your hit percent chance goes up. Did you die and restart? Why are your stats so bad?
[15316.02s -> 15340.74s]  It's not a question for me. Okay, we're doing dexterity. See, defense. Average chance that
[15340.74s -> 15346.66s]  Dark Shaman will hit you 40%. When this goes up again, it's not going to go up again, is it?
[15347.62s -> 15354.04s]  90. Still at 40%. So bad. Only 27 mana. I have 80 mana, but if...
[15355.64s -> 15369.66s]  It's chance your hit and chance to hit things. All right. When's the next level of... 18 isn't
[15369.66s -> 15380.34s]  going to get more stuff. So at 18, Blood Golem will make an appearance. You do skeleton mastery, which
[15380.34s -> 15388.23s]  will... Skeleton life, damage, improve missile damage. It essentially just makes everybody better.
[15391.59s -> 15402.78s]  More health on Golem. Attack bonus gets to 40%. Health goes up by a lot because this is synergizing,
[15402.78s -> 15416.01s]  obviously, with mastery. They're not quite have... Not enough to do another mage and not another melee.
[15416.57s -> 15426.97s]  Eventually though, maybe. Make the skeletons better. Point anywhere here. Absorbs 20 damage.
[15427.69s -> 15436.28s]  As you see, that's pretty useful, but you haven't put one point in it yet. So, like, thanks. Or a
[15436.28s -> 15454.30s]  curse. And you've seen this already before. Dimvision, Iron Maiden. Choose wisely the category
[15454.30s -> 15484.39s]  you'd like to put a point into. Poison Dagger is the meta. It's not your choice. It's your
[15484.39s -> 15495.34s]  choice collectively. He wants bad choices to make it more interesting. How does giving me a shield
[15495.34s -> 15500.94s]  that absorbs a bunch of health, a bunch of damage, me trying to meme you guys? I'm trying to live.
[15502.06s -> 15531.62s]  I want to see the end of Act 1. All right. Summoning skill. No, we're not choosing categories
[15531.62s -> 15542.26s]  anymore. If he dies in Act 1, we get a 10 minute mountain stream. Yes, that is still on the table.
[15543.14s -> 15571.62s]  Skeleton Mastery. To be put to level 3, which will increase the life 24 through missile damage.
[15572.81s -> 15581.29s]  Yeah, I mean, hey, let's see. 6 to 7. And there doesn't say how much damage they do, but 6 to 7
[15581.29s -> 15591.22s]  with health at 168. So let's see. 8 to 10 now and 76 health. Better defense. They just better out
[15591.22s -> 15609.53s]  all around. Okay. Have what I need, right? I just want to say you betrayed the Drew crew. I'm gonna
[15609.53s -> 15636.79s]  be honest. Well, we're, we're milk mob now. Sorry. I do feel a little stronger.
[15641.72s -> 15657.99s]  I think they're a little stronger. I got everybody, right? So fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so
[15657.99s -> 15670.07s]  fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking bad. I don't know what to tell you. Drew crew
[15670.07s -> 15676.39s]  have their time and they continue to have time. But it's not just only about the Drew crew. It's
[15676.39s -> 15683.61s]  about other crews making an appearance, being able to have fun.
[15686.01s -> 15710.39s]  Watch out for that explosion. It's gonna happen. Kill it. Oh, oh, crystal sword. All right. That's
[15710.39s -> 15733.54s]  better. 7 to 24. 1 to 2. Take a look at that. All right. I get corpse explosion now, at least
[15733.54s -> 15759.51s]  temporarily. 20 to 44 damage. I'm good with that. And let's get corpse explosion on. I don't know.
[15759.51s -> 15769.00s]  Let's say I'm not cute. I got to redo this bar. I'm going to get F1 is going to be skeleton.
[15769.80s -> 15785.08s]  No, no, no. F1 is no. F1 amplify. F2 corpse explosion. F3 weaken. No. Yeah. And then F4,
[15785.08s -> 15797.30s]  F5, F6. So these are my offense moves. And then here my, yeah. So F4, F5, F6. I can also scroll
[15797.30s -> 15809.99s]  too, but it kind of is hard to do. Miss things very easily. All right. Now I have corpse
[15809.99s -> 15817.54s]  explosion so I can do this. This just became possible to beat this. As long as I never take
[15817.54s -> 15840.18s]  this weapon off. Find portal again. Shit. Right. Okay. F7. Please, Jeremiah, please. Bind your
[15840.18s -> 15860.18s]  portal. Level two. Where is it? I feel like I'm missing somebody. Am I? No. There have been
[15860.18s -> 15887.37s]  exactly 5,200 people here for the last hour. That's kind of crazy jerk. That's a dagger. Yep.
[15887.93s -> 15891.21s]  But I can't do corpse explosion that much because I don't want to lose bodies
[15893.83s -> 15909.34s]  for somebody. It's tricky. Not up in the top right corner. I mean, it's probably going to be lower
[15909.34s -> 15930.39s]  left. That's where I think it is. Easy. I like the sword. It adds to my attack rating pretty well.
[15934.95s -> 15946.22s]  Let's try. Almost. There's a little too. Do not let me leave here without the waypoint.
[15946.94s -> 15951.66s]  If you see me go down. Oh, we're going to go. No, I have to get the waypoint.
[15952.38s -> 15969.40s]  This is a waste of time. Corpse explosion is a broken skill. Yes, it is. Yes. Nice volume.
[15980.55s -> 15992.71s]  It is pretty good. You turn up my volume, please. Yeah. Sorry about that. I'll be over in five
[15992.71s -> 16016.10s]  minutes. I know you don't want to get out of bed. You want anything else? This way.
[16025.53s -> 16038.78s]  Never seen this build on forums before. Look at that. Look at how good it is. Overuse it.
[16049.98s -> 16066.25s]  Unlimited power. Who says that? Who says it? I just want to know if you know who says that.
[16066.25s -> 16083.98s]  Oh, if my game were to crash right now, would it? It's not like I lagged and I died, right?
[16085.18s -> 16097.75s]  It would just save the game where I am. I think so.
[16110.26s -> 16127.22s]  Not bad. I'm going to push this up. I think build, man. Stop teasing me.
[16128.02s -> 16154.07s]  I'm going to come in handy here. Don't waste it.
[16156.87s -> 16173.00s]  Shit, this crap is everywhere, dude. How long have I been screaming now? Four hours? Four and a half
[16173.00s -> 16197.43s]  hours? Something like that? Come on, waypoint. Bro, please. Flare Act 1 already. I knew somebody
[16197.43s -> 16202.63s]  was going to say that. I knew it when I said, oh, you know, four and a half hours. I was waiting
[16202.63s -> 16208.95s]  for the four and a half hours and you still want to kill Dario. Look at me. Get with the program.
[16223.02s -> 16230.39s]  Dude, get through Act 1 already. What the fuck, man? You're really starting to piss me off.
[16231.27s -> 16254.55s]  Sorry. I am a good level, though. 16? 16? You really want to be somewhere around level 20 for
[16254.55s -> 16272.01s]  Act 2. Like 15 to 20 is where you want to be. Usually. I hate these spiders.
[16273.13s -> 16279.30s]  I've got to kill this motherfucker down here. OK, no, no, no, no, no. Run, run, run, run away.
[16279.30s -> 16295.11s]  There's a lot of people there. This is my first time playing Diablo 2. Yeah, I know.
[16296.92s -> 16307.93s]  I'm just trying to get a feel for it. Where is this waypoint?
[16308.73s -> 16330.63s]  We're going to do Diablo 3. No, no, I don't want to play D3. Careful. Three SOJs in chat.
[16333.98s -> 16342.38s]  Stones of Jordan were, it really was crazy how that was just the currency of the game.
[16342.94s -> 16349.59s]  I told you guys that I got scammed out of a pre-patch worm skull before, right?
[16360.34s -> 16373.24s]  All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got scammed. Yeah, because I don't know. I was an idiot.
[16374.12s -> 16386.70s]  Is he dead? How strong is this thing? Is Diablo 2 worth paying $20 for? Well,
[16386.70s -> 16391.16s]  he missed the first part of the stream. Instead of a lot of bad things.
[16393.00s -> 16411.69s]  Level up. We cannot kill this. I'm afraid to go in there. Kill that thing right there.
[16411.69s -> 16418.04s]  Things lightning chanted. I will die if I go in here. Kill it. Come on. I know you can.
[16418.04s -> 16422.06s]  Get a couple more people in there. Get in there. All right, easy.
[16422.78s -> 16448.66s]  I can't cast. Here we go. I can't go in here. Oh, it's too bad if I do. You're in such a shitty
[16448.66s -> 16459.18s]  spot. Come out of that spot. No, don't just go in. What are you, dumb? There's no corpses?
[16459.18s -> 16466.90s]  I'll be back. Stay there. Stay there. How much health does he have? Let's get too much health.
[16466.90s -> 16487.96s]  All right. We have to kill some stuff. Run. I found it. But I can't leave. I'm so useless without
[16487.96s -> 16497.83s]  the army. Oh, there he is. He's already got his health back. Oh, you've got to be fucking
[16497.83s -> 16509.43s]  kidding me. He regens. How am I going to kill this? Shoot teeth at him? No, that's the best
[16509.43s -> 16529.64s]  way to do it. I want to go in there and just smash him. Just wait it out. Look at, he's
[16529.64s -> 16533.24s]  regening more faster than I can kill. He's regening faster than I can kill him.
[16534.36s -> 16561.67s]  Try to pull out the teeth. I'm going teeth. Let's do it. Not ideal. Not ideal. I have to,
[16561.75s -> 16569.85s]  how much am I lighting at? 10. No, it's dead. I'm going to die. What do I do? Did I hit him
[16569.85s -> 16574.17s]  once? No, that's death. See, look at the one little of those bolts. No, no, no. This is
[16574.17s -> 16577.99s]  hardcore, guys. You can't make a stupid mistake like that. He's going to follow us around,
[16577.99s -> 16592.25s]  but that's fine. I'm going to get an army. No bodies anywhere. No bodies. We have to find one.
[16598.82s -> 16606.58s]  There. You can't wait to see this boomer is going to get owned. That's what you think,
[16607.46s -> 16610.63s]  but it's probably not going to happen. I'm going to be very careful.
[16611.59s -> 16614.87s]  I know how dangerous this is. I'm going to be very, very, very careful.
[16617.86s -> 16638.62s]  Okay. On the way point. We're fine. I need to kill this spider. All right. This is enough.
[16639.26s -> 16654.57s]  This is enough. Let's go. Come on, boys. Where are you at? Where are you at? You're hanging out
[16654.57s -> 16690.36s]  over here somewhere. Where is he? In here? Get him. Get him. Get him. God damn it. Come on.
[16691.75s -> 16699.08s]  He's melting. My golem. Every time. Kill. Holy shit. I thought the game crashed and I was about
[16699.08s -> 16715.05s]  to scream. Don't let him run. Kill him. He's almost dead. Well, that wasn't worth it. Oh, well.
[16715.69s -> 16730.04s]  Give me a skeleton. How many times this German says, get him. This stream. Oh, probably a lot.
[16731.27s -> 16741.99s]  Get him. Get him, guys. Get him. Get him. Get him. Yeah. All right. Let's get lucky and find
[16741.99s -> 16749.05s]  level four immediately and then fight the major boss of the video game. I need more. Easy. Easy.
[16749.05s -> 16756.23s]  Don't go. Don't just go on running in. This is bad. This is bad. Get him. This is bad. Get him.
[16757.19s -> 16768.28s]  Get him, guys. This is bad. Get him. I don't feel safe without a full crew.
[16768.28s -> 16784.34s]  And why would I? It's the only thing that this point's in. God damn it. How about over here?
[16784.98s -> 16813.18s]  Up left. Get him and resurrect him. Shattering these guys alive because one of these magicians
[16813.18s -> 16830.01s]  has the free. Kill it. Don't blow it up. Good. All right. Now I need two more mages. Undead,
[16830.01s -> 16867.94s]  extra strong. Don't let him turn around. Kill it. Get it. Kill it. Get it. Kill it. Well, team,
[16867.94s -> 16875.74s]  back to being confident again. Feel good. It's like a zit on my face. It's coming up.
[16875.74s -> 16880.30s]  Where did that come from? You know when your face is normal and then 10 minutes later,
[16880.30s -> 16899.61s]  there's just a zit on your face. Why does that happen? I hate that. Nothing in here.
[16900.65s -> 16908.14s]  Where is level four? That's stress. Yeah, probably.
[16910.94s -> 16916.78s]  Superior studded leather. We can turn that into something if I really want to.
[16917.74s -> 16921.26s]  Do I want to? I don't know. Should I put, should I imbue that?
[16925.82s -> 16928.94s]  No? You don't think so? I know I can come back here and do it.
[16932.65s -> 16938.38s]  I think I don't have to fight anything.
[16948.92s -> 16981.46s]  Oh, I can give that to Kyle. Oh, lots of money. I don't like how they're dying. They're dying
[16981.46s -> 16996.28s]  to regular enemies, which I don't like. I really don't like that at all. Level up. I will. Before
[16996.28s -> 17005.56s]  we fight Andariel. Don't worry. I just want to get there first. I'm so sorry. I just punched
[17005.56s -> 17018.01s]  in the face. Oh, let's go up this way. Level up. Re-level up. Re. These guys suck.
[17040.44s -> 17043.48s]  I've explored the entire left side and you tell me it's not over here.
[17044.28s -> 17070.70s]  What did I say? Blizzard sucks. The first like 30 minutes of this stream. Anger. It's true though.
[17073.58s -> 17083.40s]  I think Coolz will show. Please. I just want to do it. It's taken me five hours to kill Andariel.
[17084.04s -> 17091.96s]  Come on. I can't have it cross five hours. I know we've spent like 40 minutes picking abilities.
[17092.68s -> 17108.58s]  Come on. It's right here. And then we're going to make a safe point. Everyone's alive. There it is.
[17109.14s -> 17125.93s]  Catacombs level four. Kill Andariel. Oh, thank God. Okay. Easy. Tricky room.
[17125.93s -> 17132.92s]  Tricky room. Tricky room. Tricky room. I'm scared. I hate hardcore. I don't like hardcore. It's too
[17132.92s -> 17159.77s]  stressful. Okay. I got to go in here with a full team. All right. I got to hold enchanted. I got
[17159.77s -> 17174.36s]  to run up before he does anything. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. How? What? Oh, right. All
[17174.36s -> 17186.09s]  right. Go back to time. We're going to get the archer with the bow. Hold on. Isn't she like level
[17186.09s -> 17204.09s]  three? Well, that was a stupid thing to do. You can die instantly. Level seven. I've been leveling
[17204.09s -> 17216.62s]  Kyle. Why would I? I want the act three companion. Should I imbue this? It's hardcore.
[17218.14s -> 17222.46s]  You know what I'm saying? It's hardcore. I got to take the opportunity. Superior studded leather.
[17222.46s -> 17226.73s]  Just imbue it and make it a rare. I can't just hold on to it. What if I die?
[17229.75s -> 17238.92s]  Save it? There's better armor at Charsey. Is there a new loser? Jesus Christ.
[17242.44s -> 17250.31s]  Okay. Right. Get rid of the Dirk.
[17250.31s -> 17272.36s]  He dies. He dies. Yep. It all build it up to this moment. I need antidote potions.
[17273.72s -> 17297.69s]  Okay. How much are they? They're expensive. It might be overkill, but it's not. Trust me.
[17298.73s -> 17336.65s]  We're going to be such a coward. What am I doing? Is stack when you drink. What are you talking about?
[17336.65s -> 17348.39s]  You really don't need to do this. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. If I get poisoned, I'm going to die.
[17349.03s -> 17355.42s]  So I have to instantly just take it off and I'm going to make the portal in a place where I can
[17355.42s -> 17366.50s]  just run the fuck away. You can't die from poison. No, but I can die from a swing to my head.
[17367.54s -> 17386.95s]  That's a coward strat. This is hardcore, man. All right. Gamble. I want at least studded leather.
[17386.95s -> 17411.24s]  This is hardcore and I'm alone. I have my pretend friends here. You don't have to be. No,
[17411.32s -> 17418.20s]  I mean for today, I do because I was shadow banned from battle net. I have to make a new
[17418.20s -> 17428.02s]  account and buy the game again. We've went over this. All right. So studded leather. No,
[17428.02s -> 17438.18s]  I'm not going to buy this from Charsey. You can't rely on multiplayer. No, I can't.
[17438.98s -> 17449.96s]  I got to accomplish it. Got to achieve it on my own. Studded leather. Come on. Let's see it.
[17450.84s -> 17493.43s]  Ooh. Ooh. Come on. All right. What am I putting points into? That's what we got so far. 50
[17493.43s -> 17525.69s]  vitality, 48 strength, 32 dexterity, 36 energy. You get banned for a 20 year old game. Did he die
[17525.69s -> 17538.78s]  once? If I die once, the character's gone. Did you use map hacks? No. The only thing I've ever used
[17538.78s -> 17555.13s]  was the Glide wrapper. Is that illegal? I don't know. What are we doing though? Wait, it is.
[17557.50s -> 17564.58s]  Wait, the Glide wrapper is illegal. And that's why I got banned. It's just to make it so you
[17564.58s -> 17577.40s]  can see the 3D shit. No, is that you for real? I don't believe that for a second.
[17578.36s -> 17595.03s]  All right, we're doing vitality. All the Glide wrapper does is just make it so you can
[17595.03s -> 17609.72s]  actually see the X in the 3D stuff and everything, right? That was so disappointing when I saw that
[17609.72s -> 17616.68s]  though. All right, let's do skill. Let's take a look. Again, here we are. So you can see
[17619.75s -> 17631.58s]  these are fake just to make sure you understand they're fake. Next level, we open up some stuff
[17631.58s -> 17641.10s]  down here. Now it looks like we can... I don't know. It's up to you. Poison dagger, bone armor.
[17641.74s -> 17664.73s]  We still have iron maiden. Weaken. Up to you. Pick the category. Hold on. It screwed up.
[17666.17s -> 17677.11s]  Blizzard fucking sucks. All right, you know when you say something you know you're like,
[17677.11s -> 17683.99s]  I probably just don't say it. Who cares? Me angrily saying Blizzard sucks four hours ago is like,
[17684.55s -> 17702.81s]  oh well. Whatever. Oh well. Oh well. They're a 40 streamer without sponsors.
[17703.77s -> 17711.11s]  I don't think I'm going to get invited to the next Overwatch mixer. No. Uh oh.
[17726.33s -> 17736.46s]  Okay, poison and bone. Cool. What do you want? Pick something good.
[17737.42s -> 17748.82s]  You pick teeth right now. Why would you pick teeth right now?
[17749.78s -> 17752.74s]  Are you trying to fucking kill me? Yes, but don't answer that.
[17758.07s -> 17765.03s]  Yeah, you're giving me bone armor. Good. Good. That's just 20 extra health permanently.
[17767.74s -> 17781.10s]  Nice job. Thank you. Thank you so much guys. I'm going to show you some of the other category
[17781.10s -> 17783.66s]  stuff down here just so people that don't know what the hell is going on they can
[17784.38s -> 17791.77s]  make a more informed decision. So bone armor receives plus 15 absorption
[17792.41s -> 17799.66s]  from bone wall and bone prison. Here's bone wall. Bone wall just makes a gigantic annoying wall
[17800.78s -> 17813.88s]  of bone. It's a way to block stuff off. One and one. And then bone prison can hold anything.
[17813.88s -> 17831.16s]  Creates a barrier of fossilized bone around your target so it just traps them. Bone wall is great
[17831.16s -> 17838.34s]  in the maggot layer. It can help a lot. But watch, look at how cool this is.
[17841.29s -> 17844.73s]  Now that just stays on forever until it comes off. I'm gonna make it f8.
[17849.42s -> 17852.62s]  All right, no more fucking around. No more dicking around. Let's see if I can kill the
[17852.62s -> 17861.16s]  first boss in the game with what you guys have presented. All right.
[17875.21s -> 17895.75s]  Get rid of the shamans. Don't get too overwhelmed. Look at that bone armor. It's helping so much.
[17896.55s -> 17906.39s]  I feel safe. Okay. All right. Let's go. Not yet. Not yet. No. Hold on. I want to make sure I've
[17906.39s -> 17914.41s]  never- I want to make sure I'm in full health. We're good? Okay. I think we're good. Here we go.
[17914.41s -> 17922.81s]  I'm actually kind of nervous. I've never done this before. Everyone, have you poured a two
[17922.81s -> 17935.78s]  liter in your friends humidifier? What the fuck are you talking about? I didn't do that.
[17936.50s -> 17946.84s]  Uh, interesting though. I wonder, is it in a humidifier? A two liter of what? Of like sprite?
[17947.40s -> 17959.16s]  What would happen if you did that? That's so stupid. I just took damage because of that.
[17959.16s -> 17966.55s]  All right. Let's go. Here we go. On Dariel. No more, no more sitting around. Let's go.
[17967.43s -> 17988.22s]  Everybody in. This is shamans. Holder yet. That's good. Any more shamans over this way?
[17989.53s -> 18001.86s]  Kill that shaman right there. Oh God. I was dead. Everybody's dead. Everybody's dead. Everybody's
[18001.86s -> 18017.53s]  dead. Everybody's dead. Run. Run, run, run, run, run. Back to town. Greetings. You didn't even use
[18017.53s -> 18024.68s]  an antidote? No, man. I don't want to get killed. I don't want to take one punch and die. It's- I
[18024.68s -> 18045.94s]  need- Okay. We need corpses. Everybody stand still. Stay, stay, stay. Okay. Where is she?
[18045.94s -> 18051.88s]  All right. Everybody get- Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it. Pull her in here. All right. Get her,
[18051.88s -> 18082.07s]  get her. What's going on? She instantly killed everybody. Get me out of here. Get me out of here.
[18090.65s -> 18102.82s]  Okay. I'm fine. Let's refill the potions. All right. Somebody just wrote
[18105.22s -> 18113.05s]  Hey. Fuck. It's all right. It's okay. All right. All right. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[18113.05s -> 18117.45s]  no, no, no, no. We're not doing that. I'm going in with a full army. I'm not going to get killed.
[18118.49s -> 18127.26s]  Let's just go to the dark woods and get people. I'm not going in with just my clay buddy. That
[18127.26s -> 18145.67s]  would be absolute death. Just do not use a town portal under any circumstances. I need bodies.
[18146.23s -> 18154.63s]  It's just me and you. I can't wait to see what items we get. I'm so excited,
[18155.59s -> 18166.49s]  but nervous at the same time. Let's go get blood vials. Oh, stamina shrine.
[18169.22s -> 18171.46s]  You guys just kill. I'm not going to hit anything. I don't want to break it.
[18174.94s -> 18183.32s]  Don't use a town portal. I'm being an idiot. Same deal. Then I'm going to swarm her.
[18184.60s -> 18202.78s]  I'm going to go for it again. All right. Let's go. Follow me. You got the throwback. You ate a
[18202.78s -> 18206.70s]  bunch of Oreos and threw up in your mother's bed. I drank a bunch of... I drank a bunch and
[18206.70s -> 18218.15s]  puked in a friend's bed with brothers. I don't think that's the same story. I don't think those
[18218.15s -> 18225.75s]  two things are connected. All right. Give me some mana potions. No, I don't need them. All right.
[18225.75s -> 18235.13s]  Good. All right. Here we go. Back in. I have... I still have town portal. Oh, fucking God damn it.
[18235.13s -> 18248.17s]  Why? It's so... All right. Here we go. One, two, three. Get in.
[18272.06s -> 18277.18s]  Okay. Wait. She's almost dead. She's almost dead. She's almost dead. I'm fine. I don't... Am I?
[18278.38s -> 18292.71s]  I've never done this before. I don't know what... Save. Fuck around.
[18301.21s -> 18333.13s]  She's hitting me. She's hitting me. Yeah. I did it. Wait. Kane will do this for free.
[18333.69s -> 18343.21s]  This is a great victory indeed. Loot the chamber? Yeah, I will.
[18343.21s -> 18347.77s]  Many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey.
[18347.77s -> 18353.70s]  Finally. You know what assistance I can. Remember, Diablo is still out there,
[18354.42s -> 18362.25s]  seeking something in the desert. On your way to loot Golane. And Dario's death brings about
[18362.25s -> 18374.04s]  renewed life for us all. Yes. Now we talk to Warif, but not yet. Finally, we may rejoice.
[18374.76s -> 18382.54s]  We were dead. We can never repay. In time, we're able to rebuild our order. Skipping quests.
[18382.86s -> 18391.93s]  He must just be watching a video.
[18393.85s -> 18395.53s]  What can I do for you?
[18395.53s -> 18397.77s]  All right. Let's get these identified and see if there's anything worth using.
[18401.91s -> 18415.86s]  6 to 23. No. So there's only... No. 9 to 22. No. No.
[18426.12s -> 18437.90s]  Got a regular ruby. That's pretty good. All that shitty items. Well,
[18439.80s -> 18453.94s]  uh, not necessarily because, I mean, I guess I could, uh, I might just do it again.
[18454.90s -> 18479.08s]  I might just kill on Dario again. What you need. At least you got a normal ruby. That actually
[18479.08s -> 18484.12s]  will come in handy. If I get a weapon with a socket, that's just 20 plus extra damage.
[18485.08s -> 18500.81s]  That's pretty great, actually. Is that better? No. All right, let's go to Act 2.
[18500.81s -> 18503.77s]  The caravan is prepared. Good evening.
[18503.77s -> 18518.47s]  Shall we? Oh, hey, you want to watch a cut scene? I didn't lose the chamber. Oh, sorry.
[18518.47s -> 18525.59s]  We traveled east over the mountains and into the vast deserts of broken lands. Sorry.
[18526.71s -> 18534.55s]  As the days passed, my companion told me of himself that he had once been a great warrior
[18535.51s -> 18546.47s]  and that a dark and secret burden gnawed heavily upon him. We traveled for an eternity
[18546.47s -> 18558.31s]  across that arid wasteland. How long, I couldn't say. And oh, a dark cloud seemed to follow us
[18558.87s -> 18564.55s]  just over the horizon. Yeah, the cut scene still goes on. Finally, the journey ended. We climbed
[18564.55s -> 18586.68s]  the last bridge. The shining jewel sea beyond. We made camp that last night. It looks like
[18586.68s -> 18593.80s]  Kenshi. Perhaps it was the warm desert wind or the sound of the ocean, but for the first time
[18593.80s -> 18603.00s]  in many weeks, I slept. However, the dreams returned, but these were clearly not my own.
[18603.08s -> 18611.05s]  I beheld the vision of a great man, the mage. You were there too, Tyrael. I remember
[18611.69s -> 18620.25s]  seeing you in my dream. His brethren had cornered a great demon in Baal, the lord of destruction,
[18620.25s -> 18628.49s]  had been set loose upon the world. They attempted to imprison the demon within a sacred stone.
[18629.05s -> 18640.47s]  Yet when the rinse failed, Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered to contain the demon within himself,
[18641.19s -> 18652.30s]  completing the prison. He instructed his brethren to bind him with soul within.
[18652.30s -> 18666.38s]  How long is this? This is pretty long. I'm not even sure why we're watching this.
[18668.54s -> 18674.20s]  This is my brother. Sleep now. We set out with the dawn.
[18680.41s -> 18683.53s]  The next morning, we walked over the hill toward
[18684.09s -> 18700.23s]  Lutgulain. I had no idea then of the horrors that were in store for me there. Greetings, honored
[18700.23s -> 18707.43s]  traveler. I am Jeren, lord of Lutgulain, and I bid you welcome to my fair port city. I'm glad to
[18707.43s -> 18712.31s]  know that once again caravans are free to travel through the western pass. We've been having some
[18712.31s -> 18722.30s]  problems though. We're here, Akdu. It all began when a dark wanderer came this way,
[18722.30s -> 18727.50s]  looking for the tomb of Tal Rasha. No one knows exactly where Tal Rasha,
[18727.50s -> 18731.82s]  keeper of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain to be far out in the desert. Thank God the skeleton
[18731.82s -> 18738.14s]  came with you. Now my people whisper tales of the dead rising from their tombs and horrible creatures
[18738.14s -> 18753.59s]  lurking amongst the moonlit dunes. Not explained. Okay, it's you raising the dead. How do I know I
[18753.59s -> 18772.20s]  could trust you? I can trust you. Welcome to my shop. Better potions now. I'm bringing him money.
[18775.26s -> 18784.30s]  This skeleton needs to calm the fuck down. He's fine. He's just out of bath. That's why he's
[18784.30s -> 18802.87s]  doing this. All right, so the first thing you do here is obviously you gotta take the townspeople
[18802.87s -> 18810.28s]  of Lutgulain, trust you. You gotta clear out the sewers. I've heard that you are responsible for
[18810.28s -> 18820.65s]  banishing Andariel back to the burning head press stranger. Only noobs do every quest? For which
[18820.65s -> 18825.37s]  you're up against, my friend. You ought to look over my inventory of items. All right, the portal
[18825.37s -> 18831.13s]  is still there. That's right. I can go loot still. Okay, do the sewers. The sewers actually can kind
[18831.13s -> 18844.15s]  of suck. The enemies are not easy. Yeah, let's just go. Let's go loot the chamber. Yeah, it's still
[18844.15s -> 18888.01s]  here. Ah, we can still do it. All right, let's go to the back. Kill the cow? I can't do that till
[18888.57s -> 18894.34s]  the owl is dead, right? Or is that only after Act 1? I don't remember. It's been so long.
[18895.62s -> 18911.88s]  Just do the cow level? Can I do it? Can I? No, I can't do it yet. Okay, he's killed Bael. Yeah.
[18912.92s -> 18921.08s]  All right, was there anything back here? Nothing was even back here. But I did get companions,
[18921.08s -> 18930.01s]  though. You have so much gold. Yeah, I don't mind having that much gold on me because
[18930.81s -> 18941.45s]  it's not if I... Oh, if I die, I'm gonna lose it. No, I'll be fine. Yeah, we're good. Please pick up
[18941.45s -> 18963.38s]  the gold. I beg you. You just did. Okay, let us do the sewers. Remember, say Bael. Bael. Where's
[18963.38s -> 18970.82s]  Atama? They're being attacked and harassed by enemies underneath the sewers. It's your job to
[18970.82s -> 18980.23s]  take care of them. There's the guy to gamble with. How much money do I have? I don't have that much
[18980.23s -> 19022.54s]  money at all. Watch me just die here. Easy. Don't get too cocky. Fire resistance? Not very good.
[19023.58s -> 19034.42s]  Not very good. Did we just get... Did two raids come in at the same exact time? Wait, what?
[19037.88s -> 19041.40s]  A double raid? Was this intentional or is this unintentional?
[19041.80s -> 19057.13s]  A box box came in with a huge raid and so did XFSN Saber. That's pretty crazy. Welcome, guys.
[19060.44s -> 19067.42s]  Hope both of you had a good stream. It's on slow-mo follower only. Oh, well, that's not good.
[19068.14s -> 19078.54s]  All right, turn it off. Back in demons instead. If you're wondering what you're doing, why are you
[19078.54s -> 19084.06s]  playing Diablo 2? It's 2020. What are you doing? And it's vanilla Diablo 2. I don't know. I just
[19084.06s -> 19091.34s]  felt like doing it. This is hardcore and Chad is picking every stat and skill and they picked
[19091.34s -> 19100.90s]  the class too. So blame them for the 48 strength and 32 dex I have. But welcome. Thanks, guys.
[19103.74s -> 19108.38s]  They're free. Push them back. What do you mean no, we aren't? I could have just died right there.
[19110.58s -> 19117.75s]  You almost just killed me, guys. You almost just fucking killed me. All right, that's a lot of
[19117.75s -> 19124.46s]  arrows. I actually... That's a lot of enemies and a lot of arrows. I don't think this is going to
[19124.46s -> 19140.52s]  last very much longer. I'll be completely honest. Hey, I'm new here. What kind of streamer are you?
[19141.24s -> 19145.64s]  No, you know, I like to dabble in fucking all kinds of fun stuff. You know,
[19146.12s -> 19152.60s]  Nintendo, Mega Man fan. I just love Mega Man.
[19174.06s -> 19185.48s]  Why is it so loud? Is it still that loud? Even after turning down to almost a zero? After all
[19185.48s -> 19220.42s]  this, turn up my voice like that. Is that better? Can you hear me now? Hello? Hi. How are you?
[19220.42s -> 19237.93s]  Can you hear me? Yes. Now I'm too loud. Well, what is this? A thousand times better than what
[19237.93s -> 19257.58s]  I have on right now. Yeah. We get a skill point for this too, by the way. I can't believe I'm
[19257.58s -> 19262.70s]  fucking swinging at people with a weapon. I still can't believe I'm doing this.
[19264.62s -> 19284.50s]  Where is everybody? Get over here. Where is everybody? Are you body blocked? Get over here.
[19285.30s -> 19307.74s]  Look at the level two. Oh no, I can hear the game.
[19310.07s -> 19335.26s]  Where do I go? Down here? I forgot about the bone armor. Well, I've died. Look at how I'm so spread
[19335.26s -> 19341.38s]  out with skills. I don't, yes, I forgot about the bone armor. There's a point in teeth guys.
[19342.10s -> 19378.34s]  I forgot. I'm sorry. Just wait till we get the cube. I think we're doing all right. Let's go.
[19378.34s -> 19410.17s]  I forgot my name was Tommy Lee Bones. Who came up with that? Does he got x or enchanted? Get away
[19410.17s -> 19433.30s]  from him. Does he explode? No. I always think people explode, but you have to. You have to be
[19433.30s -> 19452.31s]  so careful. All right. This is a stalemate. This is a stalemate. That's better. I can't hurt anybody.
[19454.65s -> 19468.10s]  Can't hurt anything. This is where it all collapses. They're starting to win. This is,
[19468.10s -> 19484.23s]  yep, this is where it collapses. Any healing potions too? God damn it.
[19490.63s -> 19504.95s]  Yeah, we can level up. Where'd your potions go? I've been using them. All right, stat points. What
[19504.95s -> 19538.87s]  do you think? Here's your look. You need another tooth. No, one is fine. One tooth is fine. Pretty
[19538.87s -> 19564.33s]  split. Strength, vitality. Guys, energy is useless. Well, that's sort of accurate in a way.
[19567.34s -> 19585.85s]  All right, close it in 10 seconds. All right. Oh, we're getting indecisive. What is going on?
[19586.73s -> 19615.02s]  What the fuck is going on? Why is this so fucked up again? It's fixed. Sorry, I'm clicking a million
[19615.02s -> 19624.17s]  times a second. Use a straw pole? Yeah, but I have to make a new straw pole for every new stat point.
[19624.89s -> 19646.20s]  All right, that's good. Vitality. That's a lot of vitality. In fact, that might be too much.
[19646.68s -> 19654.92s]  I don't know. All right, let's take a look at we have unlocked some new things. We've got a bone
[19654.92s -> 19663.59s]  wall. Bone armor still. We're in the bone category here. Keep in mind, if I put one point into this,
[19663.59s -> 19669.96s]  it's going to make this increase by plus 15 absorption. Just letting you know. Just gonna
[19669.96s -> 19677.59s]  put it out there in case anybody was curious. You cannot have more than one golem out at a time.
[19677.59s -> 19683.53s]  Keep that in mind. This is blood golem. It's a golem that shares with you the life it steals
[19683.53s -> 19697.42s]  and damage it receives, right? Okay, so this is we share health and I forgot. I forgot about this one.
[19708.38s -> 19720.44s]  It converts 86% damage to life and we also share damage. That's the thing. In the curse category,
[19720.44s -> 19732.63s]  we can't even go down past iron maiden. You can do lifesteal and of course, we still have points
[19732.71s -> 19743.30s]  into mastery and free skeleton. Whatever it is you guys want to do. Pick a category, please.
[19749.21s -> 19759.85s]  You didn't, you don't mention the teeth. No, I said don't do teeth. Well, hold on a minute here.
[19759.85s -> 19764.68s]  Just because you guys pick it doesn't mean I have to use it. You understand that, right?
[19766.84s -> 19773.00s]  If you guys select blood golem, I don't have to summon them. What do you mean wrong? You guys
[19773.00s -> 19784.23s]  could put 20 points into blood golem and I won't summon them once. No, but we can waste 20 levels
[19784.23s -> 19806.18s]  in it. Okay, well, here we go. Summoning. What am I doing? Why would I use blood golem on hardcore?
[19807.22s -> 19829.96s]  You want to see what it does? Because we want to get to fire golem. Yeah, all right. I will,
[19829.96s -> 19841.24s]  you know, let me show you guys the other golems too. Blood golem, iron golem transforms a metallic
[19841.24s -> 19849.48s]  item into a golem that gains the properties of the item and it also has thorns. So you have to
[19849.48s -> 19855.82s]  throw an item on the ground and then at the very bottom is fire golem. It's a golem that converts
[19855.82s -> 19863.58s]  the damage it receives from fire into life and it's just a beast. You only have one golem out at a
[19863.58s -> 19881.70s]  time. Reef people's drops with iron golem. Well, that's if you are a sicko. So blood golem gives
[19881.70s -> 19890.26s]  life to every golem, as you see. Play golem is attack rating, fire golem is damage to every
[19890.26s -> 19898.44s]  single one. But you picked blood golem, so I'm going to do it. He does look actually pretty
[19898.44s -> 19924.15s]  cool though. Let's see what he looks like. Gross. He just doesn't have any skin. Pizza golem. Spaghetti
[19926.47s -> 19969.03s]  sauce golem. All right, let's move. I didn't go that far, did I? Go get him. Can I heal him somehow?
[19969.99s -> 19987.38s]  I need more. He's kind of taking it pretty well. I'm still getting my ass kicked though.
[19991.08s -> 20020.36s]  When's he going to die already? I might be okay for a little while. Everyone's here. This was
[20020.36s -> 20030.46s]  supposed to be a disaster stream, but here we are. A rune. Yeah, you didn't think I was going to do
[20030.46s -> 20039.03s]  okay. Well, to be fair, you guys did pick. Not pick 20 points into dim vision.
[20040.98s -> 20050.22s]  We went over this. Yes, yes, yes. Get emotionally invested. Wait, is this so you can just pull the
[20050.22s -> 20057.51s]  rug from underneath me? All right, no town portals. That's great. Good job. Could have made him play
[20057.51s -> 20064.50s]  assassin. Yeah, I didn't say it in the beginning of the stream, but I hate assassin. I'm so bad
[20064.50s -> 20068.50s]  with assassin. I don't like the move sets. I hate it. I'm so glad you guys didn't pick assassin.
[20069.70s -> 20080.14s]  I would have died in the blood more. Yeah, I got to get the act two mercenary.
[20089.34s -> 20098.20s]  All right, everybody stuff in there. Stuff in the hallway. Picking up minor plots.
[20100.28s -> 20129.14s]  Stop. I know. I pick up everything. Oh, he's dead. Get in there. Oh, I got clay. Clay's back.
[20129.14s -> 20133.40s]  Oh, right, right, right. Because it's not. I'm going to change to blood.
[20134.52s -> 20141.70s]  You used blood going on one time. No, he's back. He's back. See? You got a full team.
[20141.70s -> 20156.74s]  Picking up minor potion. Now you got it in my head.
[20163.50s -> 20166.70s]  I feel like this is going to start to move a little more smoothly, though, because we're not.
[20167.34s -> 20170.30s]  I think you guys have an idea of what you're doing and what you want to do.
[20171.18s -> 20189.16s]  I think we might start rolling here. Almost to the boss. This boss sucks, if I remember.
[20190.74s -> 20194.02s]  He just resurrects everybody over and over again. And there's like 100 people in the room.
[20195.14s -> 20206.90s]  Once you see the quest marker pop up, that's when you have to freak out and make a portal.
[20224.14s -> 20229.96s]  Damn skeleton. Yeah. Make it so he can't do anything. Those are the plays.
[20230.76s -> 20272.06s]  And do I get a streamer's choice? Skill point? No. Really? Come on. No. All right. Fine. You
[20272.06s -> 20277.38s]  you can't have that as your title then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right.
[20277.38s -> 20299.34s]  Nobody getting hit by that. You can do it for a wink. I'm trying. I do more damage.
[20299.98s -> 20315.37s]  That morning's already good. Hmm. No. Get rid of this too. Fucking problem on the ground. Who
[20315.37s -> 20334.86s]  cares? Where is this guy? Show show my skill point. You know, you do. I know I could just pick it.
[20334.86s -> 20351.30s]  Right. I mean, it'll break every rule, but I can do it. You're still alive. Yeah. Oh, it has to be
[20351.30s -> 20359.29s]  down here. There's no other options. It's always the worst thing in these games when you look at
[20359.29s -> 20363.77s]  every single possible avenue and it's the one tiny little spot that you didn't go down.
[20364.90s -> 20389.30s]  Right here. This little sliver. Don't die. Wink. Did a wink come through? All right. I need to.
[20389.30s -> 20414.65s]  It's not even it. Where is the where is the right place? Top left? No. The fuck lower left.
[20414.65s -> 20428.57s]  I think it's the only place it's not. I think it's down here. Am I correct? Oh, yep. Okay. Yeah.
[20428.57s -> 20439.78s]  Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I'm going to get 10. Hold on. Wait, I can't. I don't want to die.
[20440.50s -> 20477.00s]  I'm going to revive them first before you do. Apologize. What? I didn't do anything.
[20477.56s -> 20535.93s]  There we go. Weaken. See how much of an area that is. All right. Get him. He's got a lot of health.
[20543.86s -> 20545.62s]  Book of skill and scale mail.
[20546.50s -> 20569.24s]  I love that sound. That's pretty good. 17 health. Two mana after each kill.
[20570.12s -> 20583.61s]  Free skill point. Hey, that strength is coming in handy somehow. I might just put life in it.
[20584.65s -> 20598.58s]  Oh, I can't leave. Roderick scroll. This tells you where the cube is. The Roderick cube.
[20599.38s -> 20614.47s]  Get that socketed sword. Superior crystal. Seven to 24. Five to 15. Wait, hold on. Let's go examine
[20614.47s -> 20635.56s]  this. Imbue it. What level is it? 43. Five to 15. If I imbue it, it's probably just going to turn into
[20635.56s -> 20656.98s]  this. I can't imbue it. I'm going to only imbue white items, right? Here we go. Wait until hell
[20656.98s -> 20660.74s]  to imbue anything. Do you think I'm going to make it to hell with this character?
[20662.10s -> 20683.11s]  You're putting a lot of faith in me. You couldn't do it? Gotta get there first.
[20683.67s -> 20690.33s]  Open the chamber's hidden door. They're nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer.
[20690.33s -> 20697.38s]  They divided Aldrich's staves into two parts. Wooden shaft. Yep. Get the shaft. Get the head.
[20698.25s -> 20708.34s]  Get the cube. Played the game before. His name's not Dylan. All right. Here's where we get weird
[20708.90s -> 20719.37s]  because should I? Should I? I could add eight to 12 fire damage in this. That's kind of good.
[20720.52s -> 20733.94s]  That makes it better than this. And I could add five to eight. This could be like 30 or 40 damage.
[20734.66s -> 20741.37s]  It's fire damage, man. Save it for a better weapon. Yeah, but these gems just suck anyways.
[20751.75s -> 20755.03s]  I'm going to get the cube and I can start making stuff. Yeah, that's true. Hold on. Let's
[20755.59s -> 20794.31s]  organize this. Stop moving the gems. What? What? It's not by color. It's by quantity. Quantity.
[20798.33s -> 20804.73s]  Outward. Red is fire. Yellow is lightning. Blue is cold. White is undead. Green is poison. And
[20806.71s -> 20814.01s]  purple is attack rating. And then there's light steel, which is good. Very good.
[20814.97s -> 20822.09s]  And then you have these ruins. You can make ruin words. Very, very, very powerful. But we're not
[20822.09s -> 20842.33s]  going to do that any then. No. Or potentially ever. Good day. Need potions. And give me max out the
[20842.33s -> 20846.33s]  scrolls. I want 20. Just do 20 and 20. I know Cain does it all, but I want to be able to do it on the fly.
[20847.37s -> 20858.14s]  All right. So now we return to Atma for rewards. Makes it so it's less expensive to do everything.
[20858.14s -> 20868.86s]  Isn't she in here? Where is she? Where is Atma? Down here. They say that the taste of vengeance
[20868.86s -> 20877.62s]  is bittersweet. Yep. Press completed. Now we have to go. This is kind of a painful part of the game
[20878.58s -> 20886.09s]  because you have to go run around the giant wasteland.
[20886.97s -> 20899.85s]  Yeah. The rocky waste. You have to run around and it can be really kind of a pain in the ass.
[20902.22s -> 20910.31s]  And all the bugs have electricity. They're already painful.
[20910.87s -> 20928.92s]  Oh, we just have to move. We're going to walk around. Get a mercenary. I will. I'm going to
[20928.92s -> 20935.08s]  come back to town. We're going to have two points to burn. All of Act 2 suck. I mean,
[20937.94s -> 20944.26s]  Act 4 is probably my favorite. Act 4 and Act 5 are awesome. Just because Act 4 is such a mess.
[20944.26s -> 20956.14s]  It's just hundreds of enemies. It's just a giant open world with a ton of enemies.
[20961.77s -> 20986.01s]  Yeah. I would say Act 3 is worse than Act 2. Hold enchanted run. There it is. Level up.
[20988.18s -> 21005.42s]  Really want to be somewhere around 20 here. 20 to 25. Is it dead? Kill it. What does Eldoron do?
[21006.06s -> 21014.63s]  76% damage to undead. I mean, you could have an undead killing weapon if you have a sick slot
[21014.63s -> 21018.31s]  weapon. That'd be pretty cool. I almost just did these out of just habit and I almost, people
[21018.31s -> 21024.38s]  almost just freaked out. All right. We've got two skill points to put in. Well, you can take a look
[21024.38s -> 21035.70s]  what we have and to refresh your memory. If you want to just see it again, you kind of know how
[21035.70s -> 21051.90s]  this all works at this point. Bone wall, poison dagger, teeth, bone armor. I don't really care
[21051.90s -> 21085.91s]  about curses in this chat, I don't think. Okay. Let's pick something. Pick a category. Very clear
[21085.91s -> 21127.88s]  at the moment. Okay. It is. Fun deal. What skill? Fun not found. Fun not found. Do bone wall. Well,
[21127.88s -> 21131.88s]  convince your fellow chatters to select bone wall. That's, you gotta, you gotta do that.
[21132.84s -> 21173.51s]  Another point is going into blood golem. Please pick a category for the second skill point. Okay.
[21174.55s -> 21182.12s]  Some of you want curses. I feel bad for you guys because I don't think you're ever going to get
[21182.12s -> 21189.91s]  what you want. I'm not sure you guys are ever going to get what you want. Poison and bone.
[21190.79s -> 21198.42s]  I think I know where you're going. Could be wrong though.
[21212.68s -> 21219.69s]  We want teeth. We want teeth. I've actually tried to make teeth work before. You can kind of make
[21219.77s -> 21236.15s]  it work. It's really stupid though. All right. Bone ball. We do stats yet? We did not. All right.
[21236.15s -> 21251.77s]  So we got bone wall and blood golem too. All right. Want to see what bone wall looks like?
[21257.61s -> 21299.45s]  Kind of cool looking. Tell me. Jesus. Please be unique. Skeletons are dying guys. Skeletons
[21299.45s -> 21315.45s]  are not lasting very long. I repeat. Skeletons are not lasting very long. I repeat. Skeletons.
[21319.32s -> 21326.10s]  I told you we need to buff them you danguses. I'm just, I'm just going to put it out there.
[21326.10s -> 21330.74s]  If you're going to have skeletons, the game is getting progressively more help, more damage on
[21330.74s -> 21339.72s]  enemy. You can't just go spend it where you can't just blow it on bone walls. All right. Let's do
[21339.72s -> 21379.30s]  stats. Who does he think he is? Do you have a name? Strength or energy or vitality?
[21382.47s -> 21389.59s]  Bad influencer. He's a bad influencer. He's a bad influencer. All right. Strength. Thanks for ruining
[21389.59s -> 21409.24s]  the game. Again, appreciate it. Look at all these abilities. It's just all over the place.
[21410.04s -> 21414.12s]  I have to redo this. I'm never going to do weaken. Amplified damage is always going to be done.
[21414.12s -> 21425.11s]  Okay. F1 is bone armor. F2 amplify. F3 bone wall. F4 blood golem. F5 skeleton. F6 skeletal mage.
[21425.67s -> 21441.24s]  That's a little bit better. Okay. Let's go. All right. Where are we at?
[21443.82s -> 21446.86s]  We're going to be in the far hills of the cube. I want the cube so I can mess with the
[21447.82s -> 21469.59s]  recipes. It's a lot of fun. Can you wink at me in person? That just doesn't. All right. The
[21469.59s -> 21472.87s]  marshmallow wall does not do very much here. I don't even know why I'm going to. Why would I
[21472.87s -> 21501.38s]  use that? All right. It's cube hunting time. I got to get it. Where would I go? All right.
[21501.38s -> 21509.10s]  Rocky waste. We need the far hills. All right. All's the dead under the dry hills. Okay. Up
[21509.10s -> 21534.82s]  this way. I'm going to move. Don't run into people. That's the cast rate. No. Actually,
[21534.82s -> 21552.55s]  I probably should use bone wall here. Oh, dry hills. There it is.
[21557.14s -> 21573.10s]  Okay, mage. Blowing mage. Should have got the cast rate. I'm summoning necromancer though. I'm
[21573.10s -> 21600.76s]  not going to need it. At last. I need them to be strong so we can fight the boss. I need to be
[21600.76s -> 21624.09s]  strong. This is up to the... For the halls of the dead. Find it. Find it. Dude, this dude chugged
[21624.09s -> 21640.73s]  that entire bottle. Yeah. Why do I think that's so funny? I played a ton of Diablo 3. Now you're
[21640.73s -> 21646.74s]  making me get Diablo 2. Diablo 2 is a fantastic game. It's been an incredible experience. It's
[21646.74s -> 21654.84s]  one of the best games ever. It's one of the best games ever. Found it. Halls of the dead.
[21654.84s -> 21667.66s]  Let's make a little spot here. We don't have any more mages so let's get them. Sapphire.
[21678.68s -> 21683.32s]  I've burnt an embarrassing amount of time in these games.
[21689.37s -> 21698.30s]  It's truly, truly so much time. I don't remember much from when I was 16 except for
[21699.18s -> 21711.54s]  playing Diablo 2 when I got out of school. Every day. Every single day. And even
[21712.34s -> 21726.79s]  out of high school and college every day. Oh, this is a bad room. I gotta get in here. I gotta help
[21729.34s -> 21754.60s]  too many people. He's really gonna get trapped in these rooms. I gotta kill the guy resurrecting.
[21754.60s -> 21779.75s]  Get over here. Oh, hit this. I have no dexterity. Right. I forgot. How are we doing? Just one
[21779.75s -> 21796.14s]  mage. How the fuck does this build for the late game? On a scale of... We're gonna hit a wall
[21796.14s -> 21801.98s]  when I get to the boss of this act. It's really gonna determine if this is gonna be even humanly
[21801.98s -> 21819.53s]  possible. No good items. It's annoying. I really wish I had more skeletons. I wish that I had more
[21819.53s -> 21826.44s]  skeletons and they were stronger. You know, I mean if we're gonna put six, seven, eight, nine,
[21826.44s -> 21832.95s]  ten, eleven, twelve points into skeletons. I really, you know, just wish they were just a tad
[21832.95s -> 21854.55s]  stronger than they are now. Bonewall school don't get me wrong. You guys are indecisive. Fucking
[21854.55s -> 21872.82s]  boomers. All right. Decks and teeth. Got it. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh,
[21872.82s -> 21876.10s]  don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot.
[21877.37s -> 21881.45s]  There's a fucking, there's a trillion people in this room. I gotta go around the corners.
[21883.70s -> 21907.56s]  Kill him. Okay, we're good. I hit him. Okay, we're good. Use bone wall.
[21908.52s -> 21915.53s]  Oh, what? I already have a bone wall. It's standing around swinging its stuff.
[21916.09s -> 21945.51s]  Move to level two. All right, now's my opportunity. Good. I gotta wrap a run. What is it? How many
[21945.51s -> 21983.34s]  players is it set to? Four? Come here. Only one unique this whole game so far. Yeah,
[21985.46s -> 21992.04s]  an unusual bro. I have one. It's really good. Arguably one of the reasons why I'm doing okay.
[21992.84s -> 21999.64s]  Ah, because it's just a dump of health. A ton more hit recovery, which is a huge deal in this game.
[22000.44s -> 22018.44s]  Hit recovery will kill you more than anything else. I remember pre-expansion never getting
[22018.44s -> 22024.63s]  it unique. Yeah, it happened. It did happen. Once you start playing on Nightmare in Hell,
[22024.63s -> 22029.78s]  though, they drop all of the plays, especially from the bosses. A boss will drop a unique
[22030.92s -> 22037.64s]  or a set at least one out of every, especially if you have magic find. Magic find is so important
[22037.64s -> 22046.04s]  in this game. Why am I talking like I'm going to be able to do this? Once we get to Nightmare in
[22046.04s -> 22061.10s]  Hell, I'm going to have 200% magic find. That's not happening. I'll be lucky to get the axe free.
[22063.43s -> 22078.66s]  You're underestimating the bones. It is good. Looking for the cube in here somewhere.
[22085.58s -> 22092.46s]  He's getting class jealous. He's getting class jealous. This is bad. If I was a sorceress right
[22092.46s -> 22100.57s]  now, I would melt this whole room in one second. It would just be like everything would just die.
[22101.53s -> 22118.52s]  That wouldn't be very interesting. If I had Nova right now, I would just walk in a room,
[22118.52s -> 22121.86s]  right click three times and run to the next room. It'd be great.
[22134.36s -> 22139.67s]  No, I do, which is why I'm playing it. I could have said at the beginning of the stream,
[22139.67s -> 22147.86s]  no, no, no, no. I don't want to do skeletons. No, stop. Stop. No, I'm done. Hey, we're still here.
[22148.82s -> 22161.61s]  We kind of did. Why am I so good at beatboxing? I'm not really.
[22164.33s -> 22175.70s]  I can just go like this and this and this. Pretty much it. Resist fire.
[22177.94s -> 22195.40s]  I just got a taste in my mouth. What was it? I just sensed a flavor of some sort. I'm trying
[22195.40s -> 22202.65s]  to figure out what it was. I just smelt it and tasted something. It was like a chard. What is
[22202.65s -> 22210.04s]  that something? I just got like this random memory of a flavor and it was like a charred
[22210.04s -> 22214.04s]  kind of meat flavor, but it's not meat. What was it? I don't know. It's freaking me out.
[22214.68s -> 22240.04s]  What is it? It's like a smoke, like a smoky flavor. Very charred though. Turn off the stove.
[22242.41s -> 22257.94s]  Oh shit. It's been on all day. Hey, waypoint. Now I can run my friends through the whole game
[22258.50s -> 22279.32s]  in less than 40 minutes. Oh, but I can't play online because I was banned from battle. Oh,
[22279.32s -> 22286.52s]  I had a dream about the stream actually. So I had a dream that so I got this wallet.
[22286.52s -> 22291.08s]  No, this is the dream happening. Okay. So I got this wallet recently and I actually really like it.
[22292.74s -> 22301.90s]  It's great. It's this shiny metal small like travel wallet, right? It's my dreams happening
[22301.90s -> 22311.21s]  right now. It's called the ridge. It's actually a great wallet. It's fantastic. It's really good.
[22312.47s -> 22320.86s]  I had a dream last night that I was sponsored by this company that makes this wallet. I don't
[22320.86s -> 22328.34s]  know why. For some reason. And I was nervously doing a presentation for it while the chat and
[22328.34s -> 22335.98s]  there were like 30,000 people here for some reason. And it was just a wall, a spam of like,
[22335.98s -> 22342.62s]  I'm fucking out of here. Unsubbing loser. You piece of shit. Fuck you. Fucking loser. How dare
[22342.62s -> 22351.72s]  you? And it was like, no, no, people weren't joking. It was like last stream. I'll have a go to
[22351.72s -> 22358.62s]  just a wall of just, everyone was so mad. And I'm sitting there going like, and as you see the,
[22359.34s -> 22364.36s]  and I kept looking over and going, no, if fuck anyone hates this, but like I haven't
[22364.36s -> 22367.80s]  been doing it. And as you can see, you can fit like 10 credit cards in here. And
[22368.76s -> 22373.06s]  I was getting so nervous. It was a sponsored dream. Yeah.
[22375.93s -> 22404.74s]  I don't have any friends. Where'd they all go? They'll hide. Give me the cube so I can get out
[22404.74s -> 22427.13s]  of here. He thinks we hate him in his dreams. You know, I think dream you, the dream you,
[22427.13s -> 22431.37s]  at least I'm going to give you some benefit of the doubt here. Dream you guys. It just came out of
[22431.37s -> 22436.94s]  nowhere. I didn't say, Hey guys, like tomorrow's going to be a sponsored segment or Hey guys,
[22436.94s -> 22441.74s]  this is going to be a stream tomorrow. Hey guys, this is company. No, I, it was just, I turned on
[22441.74s -> 22447.42s]  my webcam and started going and was stone faced just doing an ad. That wasn't a joke. So it was
[22447.42s -> 22457.02s]  just like, what are you, what is this Jeremy? My face was like kind of red. The wallhuts are great.
[22457.90s -> 22467.91s]  They really are. I love it. This is pretty scummy. It seems like we were right.
[22468.15s -> 22481.29s]  No, but it wasn't, it wasn't even stuff like, Oh, unsubbed. I'm out of here. It was real mean,
[22481.29s -> 22500.95s]  horrible shit. It wasn't just like, Oh, unsubbed. Oh, hello. Well, you know,
[22503.14s -> 22512.94s]  have a hands. Where is the cube? Where is the cube? I'm getting so unlucky. You wonder why this
[22512.94s -> 22519.58s]  has been six hours into act one, act two, whatever. It's because I keep my RNG so bad. I can't get,
[22519.98s -> 22541.13s]  I think this is it. At least we're going to have the cube though. What should I have for dinner?
[22544.73s -> 22569.50s]  Any food suggestions in the chat here? Only good ones, please. No, not pizza. No, no. Japanese
[22569.50s -> 22577.70s]  salmon. Oh, I don't really have any food. Stir fry. That's not bad. Sounds pretty good.
[22579.06s -> 22594.20s]  I wonder what that flavor was though. I don't remember. This is still not the cube room.
[22594.84s -> 22605.70s]  How have I not found the cube yet? I have no idea. Oh, the cube. I already found the cube. It's in
[22605.70s -> 22624.50s]  the room down here. What am I? Did I not see it? How did I not see this? Cube. Okay. There it is.
[22625.46s -> 22635.45s]  The Herodric cube. You have quite a treasure there in that Herodric cube. You have, you have
[22635.45s -> 22641.05s]  quite a treasure there. You have, I'm trying, I'll get it. You have quite a treasure there in that
[22641.05s -> 22671.59s]  Herodric cube. You ready? And go. More. Blood Sapphire. Hey, he's available. He's available.
[22677.32s -> 22694.74s]  He's, yes, I'm available. Any more? Nope. That's it. What am I holding onto this for?
[22695.62s -> 22718.06s]  These rings are terrible. Salad. Let's get rid of this thing. Just taking up space.
[22718.06s -> 22754.65s]  Okay. Prepare. Save the money. You can convert three rings into an amulet. Yeah, that's true. But
[22757.40s -> 22771.72s]  no, no. All right, let's go. Time to find. Oh, the maggot lair. The best place in the game.
[22774.63s -> 22794.71s]  Best place in the game. Damn it. I think that's so hard.
[22795.51s -> 22803.99s]  Oh, God. God damn it. Somebody watched my stream for like 60 hours. I have to turn on my camera
[22803.99s -> 22824.55s]  and go like this. God damn it. It's like such a, so hard to do that apparently. Stony tomb. All
[22824.55s -> 22832.02s]  right. Fire Wastes. I'm making pretty good time in act two. Would act one take like six hours? We're
[22832.02s -> 22850.98s]  like, we're almost like halfway through act two and it's been like 40 minutes. Shit. Stamina.
[22861.96s -> 22870.14s]  He didn't spend a half an hour allocating stats. Well, you, you got, but you guys had to do that.
[22870.70s -> 22873.42s]  You guys had to know the tree. Now you guys know the tree.
[22874.38s -> 22878.06s]  You know kind of the direction you want to take the character and we can, we can move forward.
[22885.99s -> 22901.16s]  You're blaming us. Yes. Yeah. Every time I hear the ring drop, I just, I want, I want it to be
[22901.16s -> 22922.42s]  unique. So bad. These little ships are the worst. Has he died yet? Nope. I have not.
[22941.51s -> 22949.05s]  Arctic binding plus 40 cold. Hey, and guess who that's for. Guess who that's going to be great
[22949.05s -> 22965.38s]  for. The boss of this 30 defense and 40% cold resist. Take a look at this shit. It's almost 60.
[22965.38s -> 22973.08s]  Oh, I lose a slot, but it's all right. Almost 60%. Good. Resident sleeper. Wake up, wake up,
[22973.08s -> 22979.61s]  man. Wake up, bro. Wake up. All right. Don't stand still in hardcore. What are you dumb?
[22993.58s -> 23004.95s]  I need more mages for that. Wake me up when we're at a hundred strength.
[23006.15s -> 23016.47s]  Where's my pancake? Why am I, how am I responsible for getting new pancakes?
[23017.35s -> 23032.78s]  You got to take care of your own pancakes. How is it? It's not that bad. It's like nine 30.
[23035.00s -> 23048.28s]  Oh, there's a nephron. It's two 20. Ah, right, right, right. I live on the other side of the world.
[23048.76s -> 23057.37s]  Um, well, in six and a half hours, we'll see what we're at in like 30 minutes.
[23059.29s -> 23067.93s]  What do you guys think? You guys, you guys want a conclusion to this? I mean,
[23067.93s -> 23086.10s]  I feel like we kind of have to see the conclusion. You got to keep going until you die. I need
[23086.10s -> 23091.82s]  far away. So I think it's far away. It's connected to dry hill. Don't get off until you die. Well,
[23091.82s -> 23107.83s]  that's probably not going to happen. We get back up here. How are you even still alive?
[23107.83s -> 23111.35s]  Because chat accidentally made a character that wasn't completely useless.
[23112.23s -> 23140.02s]  We knew what we were doing. Yeah, that's why I'm still alive. But I don't think 14 or 15
[23140.02s -> 23148.66s]  points in teeth would get us this far. It just wouldn't. It would not have happened.
[23149.62s -> 23172.01s]  Yes, it would have. Ridge wallets are real. Yeah, I have one. I know. But I didn't,
[23172.01s -> 23176.33s]  that wasn't part of the dream. Part of the dream was not that the wallets weren't real.
[23176.33s -> 23201.30s]  Stupid ass. Get out of here. We've got their ridge wallets in my spaghetti.
[23202.10s -> 23213.40s]  No, we've gone. I only talk about products that are actually useful. JetBlue, a useful product.
[23214.12s -> 23218.12s]  Ridge wallet, a very useful actual product that you should probably get if you need a wallet.
[23218.84s -> 23235.53s]  I have nothing to do with them. I just know because I use them. It's my last time being here.
[23239.48s -> 23260.20s]  Stamina is killing me. Admit to the joke. Show the wallet on the camera. I mean, I do really
[23260.20s -> 23268.92s]  want me to go get my ridge wallet and show you. I mean, it's it's not much to see. It's just a
[23268.92s -> 23281.72s]  wallet. No. Yeah, but I've got like, I got like credit cards and my license in there and shit.
[23281.72s -> 23291.67s]  I'm not doing that. I'll just, I can just take, I'll take them out. There we go. Far away.
[23297.66s -> 23313.66s]  Actually not a terrible charm. Pretty good charm actually for right now. Champion in there. Watch
[23313.66s -> 23351.26s]  it. They get melted. Jesus. Oh, it's because this guy's here. Oh, a jewel. It's out though.
[23351.26s -> 23363.82s]  It's lying about the wallet. Oh, I own one. I'll get it in a minute. Well, when we take break two,
[23364.94s -> 23369.42s]  that's the last break of the night. I will get the ridge wallet and I will show you the wallet.
[23370.30s -> 23390.06s]  See, picky bugs. Yes, lots of bugs. This is why this part sucks because there's so many random
[23390.06s -> 23402.46s]  enemies everywhere. I'm close to the maggot there though. Oh, the zombie head. You're right. This
[23402.46s -> 23409.29s]  could be plus to something good. Okay. All right. Well, now thank you for telling me to go get that
[23409.29s -> 23417.90s]  one guy because this is plus two to raise skeleton. One to clay golem and one to bone wolf. I lose
[23417.90s -> 23426.44s]  corpse explosion and weaken. Don't care. I didn't use them anyways. Go. How many can I have now?
[23427.16s -> 23434.31s]  That's it with eight points. Oh, the next point is five.
[23458.62s -> 23467.35s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I forgot about the bugs.
[23474.57s -> 23485.18s]  Swarm and shit. Yeah, they're killing everything. Oh, fuck off. You ridge wallet.
[23491.32s -> 23510.17s]  I got, I'm going back down. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to get it. I'm going to go get it.
[23510.57s -> 23525.74s]  Hold on. I also want to get the, an act two up here. It's higher. We're about to kill Kyle,
[23525.74s -> 23534.31s]  by the way. All right. Defensive. We want offensive, defensive or combat. That's the aura.
[23534.31s -> 23553.70s]  Probably defense. I want a level 19, 19 defense. Doesn't exist. Offense, level 19 offense. All
[23553.70s -> 23565.48s]  right. Yeah. What are the different auras? Combat is probably better. Combat's like blessing a might,
[23565.48s -> 23578.31s]  whatever it is. Combat aura is healing. It's the regen aura. Probably, probably not a bad idea.
[23579.11s -> 23584.31s]  Let us pick it when you piss. Defense is just pure defense and offense is I think attack bar,
[23584.31s -> 23588.90s]  right? All right. Let us pick. Yeah. I'm going to go pee. I'll let you guys pick and I'll come back.
[23588.90s -> 23609.19s]  I'll make the pole. Wait one second. Straw pole. Bring the wallet back. I will. And we can,
[23609.51s -> 23613.83s]  um, we'll play for like another 30, 40 minutes and see how everyone's feeling.
[23614.63s -> 23634.68s]  But it's, it's going to start to get late. Okay. Vote on this and I'll be back in about two or three
[23634.68s -> 23868.82s]  minutes. See you in a minute. Guys, the wall is not real. I fucking made it up. Or did I?
[23868.82s -> 23886.09s]  This is the wallet right here. There it is. Look at how thin this is. This opens to store cards.
[23886.89s -> 23893.85s]  You can slide, I believe up to 20 cards in here and looks like an SSD. There's all kinds of styles.
[23893.85s -> 23898.66s]  With this thing. Oh, you got your little, you can see the little thumb thing here.
[23898.66s -> 23904.26s]  If you get cards in here, you just, you just push, slide them when you want out, slide it right back
[23904.26s -> 23918.36s]  in. It's easy. Cast strap on the back. Secure. Ridge wallet. Pick one up. Maybe. If you feel
[23918.36s -> 23932.38s]  like getting a new wallet. Bye. They're really good. They're very good. They're secure. They're,
[23932.94s -> 23937.50s]  they fit into pants. You can actually put this into like a jacket pocket.
[23938.46s -> 23944.52s]  If you get, you put your essentials in here. It's light. It's got a nice click to it. It's,
[23944.52s -> 23953.45s]  it's very sturdy. Never coming back. I'm never coming back. Well, all right. What did you guys
[23953.45s -> 23968.70s]  pick? Offense. Apparently it's offense. All right. Uh, look for 1119 offense. And there we go.
[23969.66s -> 23988.46s]  Uh, or, what was his offense? Ilzan. The Nari. Or, uh, Vic Yat. Vic Yat. Life 270 versus
[23989.42s -> 24002.86s]  270, 155. Are they the same? Vic Yat? Who's Kyle? All right. You want, you want Vic? Okay. Uh,
[24002.86s -> 24007.82s]  who's Kyle? You'll see. Kyle's about to die. The mercenary will replace your current one.
[24007.82s -> 24024.54s]  Kyle is dead. There he is. Look at how much better. Level 19 damage. All right. We got to
[24024.54s -> 24034.52s]  deck you out. We got to deck you out with some stuff. We got to pick some kills. All right. We
[24034.52s -> 24042.92s]  need a spear. Seven to 18, seven to seven. Required 50 decks. Eight to 28. That's not bad.
[24043.64s -> 24049.48s]  Seven. That's cheap too. All right. Get rid of this. Where's Kane? Kane, come here.
[24050.57s -> 24061.94s]  Good day. Uh, Phylactery Lich. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. $50 they say. Derm of the Ridge is
[24061.94s -> 24082.15s]  fucking $75. It's quality. It's a quality product. This thing's made out of fucking steel. You can
[24082.15s -> 24098.10s]  get the same thing for $15. This thing's made out of fucking steel, guys. Does it protect against
[24098.10s -> 24120.74s]  card skimming? What a great question. What a great question. Seriously. It does. It has RFID blocking
[24120.74s -> 24141.50s]  inside of it. There you go. Blocks RFID. It doesn't do you taxes. It's also got an integrated
[24141.50s -> 24150.82s]  expandable track. Followed section of the wallet's pure metal plates. The T design of the track
[24150.82s -> 24155.06s]  secures cards from the bottom as well as the sides, so nothing accidentally falls out of the
[24155.06s -> 24161.27s]  bottom of the wallet. It'll snugly hold one card or expand to hold numerous cards. The track is
[24161.27s -> 24167.03s]  made out of a robust elastic material that has undergone several strength tests. It can expand
[24167.03s -> 24172.31s]  to hold up to 15 cards, and when the cards are removed, it will contract to hold a single card
[24172.31s -> 24178.39s]  securely with the most pure of fucking iron and aluminum metal and steel. And it's pure steel.
[24178.39s -> 24183.51s]  15 cards. Your actual, your local Walmart little compact wallet cannot hold 15 fucking cards
[24183.51s -> 24196.47s]  securely. Sorry. I'm sorry. That's completely incorrect. It was a sneaky way to do an ad.
[24196.47s -> 24210.52s]  Ad block isn't working. I like it. I like it. Nobody gave me. I like these things.
[24211.03s -> 24219.74s]  I like this thing. I like it. I like it. Next, you're going to send me like a review of that.
[24219.74s -> 24238.71s]  I can't piss in my Berkey. Okay. All right. Fine. That's fine. Whatever. Things made out of solid
[24238.71s -> 24244.65s]  fucking like carbon steel or something. I don't know. The Berkey, it's my water filter and
[24244.65s -> 24249.61s]  everybody made fun of me because I said it sucked, but they, you can clean, you literally take food
[24249.61s -> 24257.77s]  dye out of water. All right. I'm not even going to get started on that. What do you bring so I have?
[24257.77s -> 24279.69s]  Yeah. Oh, the water filter. Yeah. Let me go get the water filter. Let me go and pick up this clunky,
[24279.69s -> 24286.49s]  huge, hard to move around thing and bring it into this office. It quotes your office in the quotes.
[24286.49s -> 24292.25s]  Of course. Of course. I'm not going to go get a Berkey filter and filter as I'm no, I'm not doing
[24292.25s -> 24298.97s]  that. No, no. It's you know how hard that is to move over here. This thing's huge. It holds like
[24298.97s -> 24311.38s]  two gallons of water. What you get, what you want me to go get the Berkey filter and pour
[24311.38s -> 24316.44s]  chocolate milk in it and see what happens. I'm not going to do that. Find the YouTube channel
[24316.44s -> 24326.25s]  that already did. All right. Let's go pick some stats, please. If you could. Oh, there's still
[24326.25s -> 24353.51s]  time. Water filter stream. Why would that be cool? It would be me just drinking water. It would be
[24353.51s -> 24364.38s]  drinking water. What would, what's the, you want me to bring the Berkey up here and filter water
[24364.38s -> 24385.54s]  through it and then drink the water. Do you want me to tell you how it tastes? Yes. Doing a water
[24385.54s -> 24404.70s]  review for milk and coffee in it. I'm not going to ruin my water filter. No, it's that you want
[24404.70s -> 24413.16s]  to talk about expensive. It was expensive. It was like a hundred something dollars for the,
[24413.72s -> 24424.34s]  that is just thirsty. All right. We're putting this into decks. No. What have I, which one?
[24424.90s -> 24441.29s]  Come on, get a pick one. Just buy a new one. I'm, but what happened if you filtered Gatorade? I
[24441.29s -> 24454.14s]  don't know. I don't know. It would get clogged up and it would just be a waste. Let's find out.
[24459.16s -> 24462.28s]  It's not, this is not going to be as interesting as you guys think it is.
[24462.84s -> 24487.24s]  All right. We're doing vitality. What about skill point? Category, please. That's a worst stream of
[24487.24s -> 24502.18s]  the new decade. I guess I did build a bird house on stream. That's true. Yeah. I built a bird house.
[24503.06s -> 24513.58s]  I could filter fucking Gatorade. What a waste of time that's going to be. And then tell you
[24513.58s -> 24521.59s]  what happens. A hundred percent of you. All right. So what, what do you want me to click?
[24521.59s -> 24540.89s]  What do you want me to do? Oh, you want the fifth skeleton. Would you look at you guys picking
[24540.89s -> 24550.49s]  things that will help us through our journey? And then Bugleberry drinks it. And then he has
[24550.49s -> 24562.54s]  to give a review. Robust flavor, pure crystal water. All right. Let's get the next skeleton.
[24563.18s -> 24578.41s]  Thanks for voting vitality. 65 vitality. Kind of good to 15. All right. The,
[24579.61s -> 24596.36s]  we have five skeletons now. Finally, it only took a million years. This is a good charm.
[24599.11s -> 24603.11s]  Recovery and lightning resistance is very important. I'm going to save the rings.
[24604.95s -> 24611.26s]  No, because I'm going to, I don't need to tell you a fucking reason for everything that I do.
[24612.14s -> 24623.40s]  I have to tell you a reason for everything to explain everything I have to do. Wait,
[24623.40s -> 24630.02s]  how are you still alive? This is how I'll show you a few ways that this could have been a disaster.
[24630.58s -> 24636.18s]  This, if you, you could have just put every single point into this and I would have no
[24636.18s -> 24641.78s]  moves. Okay. Same with here. You could have put every point into bone wall. You could have put
[24643.38s -> 24647.86s]  every point into terror. I would simply have to run around and scream while I find a way to kill
[24647.86s -> 24657.38s]  them. I mean, even bone prison is some of these are bad. You could have put all your points into
[24657.38s -> 24663.46s]  golem mastery and put one point in clay golem and that's it. And then max out like skeletal mage
[24663.46s -> 24666.82s]  and it would have ruined everything. I don't give ideas. I'm just telling you,
[24666.82s -> 24682.82s]  you guys are doing a pretty good job. Everyone look at chat. I am. You think I'm not?
[24685.14s -> 24690.26s]  All right. We're looking for, let's get our new friend out here. We get five skeletons now.
[24699.46s -> 24710.90s]  The plan though is once you get more than 15, how was I going to say community subs?
[24711.54s -> 24719.61s]  When you get more than 15 community subs, you will start overwhelming. You will get,
[24720.41s -> 24735.51s]  that's when it's a, it's a battle. That's how you know, you've made it. How are you guys doing?
[24735.51s -> 24742.97s]  Are you guys doing good? You guys chilling? I'm just chilling. Oh, superior zombie head,
[24742.97s -> 24760.73s]  leave it. I've been looking for the maggot lair so I can hate my life. I want to keep playing.
[24761.86s -> 24764.82s]  You know, I really, I want to keep playing, but it's going to get, it's getting late.
[24780.50s -> 24786.02s]  Do this again tomorrow. Um, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[24786.66s -> 24790.18s]  The reason why we did this today is because Bill was having computer problems today.
[24790.90s -> 24793.54s]  I was like, you know what? I thought about doing this a while ago and I'm going to just do it now.
[24794.74s -> 24798.18s]  I don't know what his schedule is like over the next couple of days, but we're probably going to
[24798.18s -> 24804.34s]  do keep talking. Nobody explodes. If not tomorrow, then the next day, we have that tomorrow,
[24804.34s -> 24807.78s]  the next day, whenever over the next few days, we just got to figure it out when his computer is
[24808.90s -> 24829.05s]  good to go to the filter screen tomorrow. Joel's streaming right now. Well, then that, that means,
[24829.05s -> 24851.58s]  that means he, that means he must've figured it out. Do a water filter test, test different water
[24851.58s -> 24875.93s]  filters. What a weird stream. Water filter test where I break down how, what the flavor of the
[24875.93s -> 24884.90s]  different water filters is. Pure, Brita, Ferkey. I mean, you're talking about as expensive jokes.
[24888.44s -> 24903.05s]  I mean, what am I going to do with them all? I guess I could donate them. What do you,
[24903.05s -> 24913.03s]  I don't know what I would do with them all. Did I not find them the maggot layer yet?
[24922.49s -> 24926.65s]  No, no. I mean, I'm, no, I'm talking about, guys, I'm not going to put anything like
[24926.65s -> 24936.49s]  fucked up in these filters. Let's see what happens when we filter orange juice. It's
[24936.49s -> 24951.22s]  going to come out as orange juice. It's just going to taste gross. How do you know? I don't know. I
[24951.22s -> 24966.65s]  don't know. I actually don't know the answer to this question. Where's this, where is it?
[24966.65s -> 24975.96s]  Where's the maggot layer under the far oasis? Come on, right here somewhere. You need to figure
[24975.96s -> 25003.18s]  this out. You have to be a scientist. Anybody see a little hole in the ground? No, I can't pee in
[25003.18s -> 25012.98s]  the Berkey. You do realize that if I, if I pee in the Berkey, I'm going to get banned from Twitch.
[25014.47s -> 25035.18s]  Even if I do this off camera, I'm gone. I'm, I'm gone. Let's go. I'm gone. Durma985,
[25035.18s -> 25040.94s]  so obsessed with proving to his loyal audience that the Berkey filter is legit,
[25040.94s -> 25047.82s]  he's in water filter on stream and drinks it to prove a point and then gets permanently suspended
[25047.82s -> 25065.42s]  from Twitch.tv and his partner status revoked. All right, where the hell is this place? It would be
[25065.42s -> 25091.19s]  infamous. Yes, sure. Oh, I hate running so slow. Dude, you would be a fucking legend. I don't give
[25091.19s -> 25101.29s]  a shit about being the guy that eat in the Berkey. Do you think I care more about that or being able
[25101.29s -> 25105.61s]  to like continue to stream and hang out and have fun and continue doing what I'm doing?
[25107.66s -> 25119.14s]  What do you think is more important to me right now? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[25119.14s -> 25125.78s]  hold on a minute. You're telling me that I can be the guy that pisses in a water filter and drinks
[25125.78s -> 25136.50s]  it. Everybody remembers me and laughs at that crazy thing I did. Oh, I lost all my partner status.
[25138.78s -> 25152.44s]  And eventually after that, I lose everything, every cent I own. The only reason why people
[25152.52s -> 25164.39s]  even talk about it is to laugh at me. Or I could have just played Diablo 2 and enjoyed myself.
[25166.28s -> 25172.20s]  No, good thing I pissed in that thing and one person every six months remembers me for 15
[25172.20s -> 25194.58s]  seconds. Yeah, it was me. It was me. Oh, man, those were the days. Grandpa, grandpa. Yeah,
[25198.20s -> 25210.15s]  grandpa. Wait, you're you're pissing Perry. Yeah, that's me. Wow. No way. Are you serious?
[25210.95s -> 25214.55s]  Yeah. I've seen so many top texts, bottom texts about you.
[25218.22s -> 25222.14s]  Wow, I can't believe that's so crazy. We were talking about you the other day for 15 seconds
[25222.14s -> 25228.02s]  and then didn't bring you up for like a year. Yeah, I lost out on like $7 million.
[25228.02s -> 25254.76s]  $7 million. Wow, cool. Cool, grandpa. Yeah, we saw you. We saw you in this funny meme compilation
[25254.76s -> 25266.79s]  video. I had 20 million views. Yeah, I don't get any of that money. I don't get any of that. Oh,
[25266.79s -> 25278.47s]  but you but people saw it. Yeah, they did. Oh, wait, you don't know. No, haven't seen a dime of
[25278.47s -> 25288.63s]  that one. Just pissing Perry. Son, do your grandfather a favor and go get him his favorite
[25288.63s -> 25306.54s]  Berkey. And grandson goes and gets it. He's like, Oh, this thing sticks. What's in there?
[25309.34s -> 25316.84s]  Yes. I've learned to love it. In fact, it was crazy because right after that stream,
[25317.56s -> 25331.96s]  I could never drink regular water again. All I could drink was filtered piss. So delicious.
[25332.68s -> 25349.08s]  Okay, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. The grandson has the youtuber voice because
[25349.08s -> 25384.30s]  the grandson is probably a youtuber. Found it. Two decks. Get out of here. Here it comes. Here comes
[25384.30s -> 25390.52s]  the end of here comes the end of the character. No, no, no, no, it's gonna be fine. This place
[25390.52s -> 25403.05s]  sucks notoriously. Let's just be real. We're getting arguments about stuff. Yeah, pissing
[25403.05s -> 25405.93s]  Perry over here. I can't he couldn't even figure out how to keep his channel going.
[25406.89s -> 25416.95s]  You don't even have 5000 subs on YouTube, you little shit. You know how many subs I had before
[25416.95s -> 25444.55s]  the great pissing of 2020? More than you'll ever have in your life, kid. And what I don't know is
[25444.55s -> 25452.54s]  he recorded that. The whole thing. And he uploaded it to his YouTube channel. And it got 20 million
[25452.54s -> 25467.02s]  views. And then he makes five videos after that. Talking about it and laughing about it. So all
[25467.02s -> 25474.07s]  of his YouTube friends, all of them, are making reaction videos to this. We're talking like six
[25474.07s -> 25479.27s]  to 700 million views across like 50 different channels. Pissing Perry just sits in his fucking
[25479.27s -> 25490.28s]  rocking chair. Doesn't see a dime. Doesn't see a dime. Get over here, everybody. Come on.
[25499.46s -> 25513.43s]  Don't get stuck. If anyone's gonna get stuck, it's gonna be one of you. No. Come on, Vic. He's okay.
[25514.15s -> 25526.86s]  He's doing all right. He's actually pretty good. Who thought this was gonna end here?
[25526.86s -> 25537.58s]  You were wrong. We're good. How many people we got? We got many more. All right, we got
[25537.58s -> 25547.38s]  eight, nine, we got 10 companions. It's not gonna end here. It just sucks because it takes forever.
[25548.02s -> 25552.90s]  This is why if I was a sorceress, I could just right click and do frozen orb and just walk forward.
[25553.78s -> 25561.21s]  Tell us more about how you love. When did I say I love doing that?
[25562.17s -> 25572.25s]  All right, I'm not gonna get justification for why I can pee into a Berkey on stream.
[25572.25s -> 25578.33s]  No, I don't know who did it. I don't know who drank pee already. I'm no, hey, hey, you know,
[25578.33s -> 25584.09s]  this guy drank pee already. That's okay. That's fine. Oh, good for you. Good for whoever that
[25584.09s -> 25592.66s]  was. I'm not gonna drink piss on stream. You're trying to somehow justify me being able to drink
[25592.66s -> 25605.30s]  pee on this stream. No, no, no, no, no, no. Are you serious? Are we actually talking about that?
[25605.30s -> 25627.62s]  You can't be serious. Bear Grylls did it. He didn't even use a filter. Yes, he did. He buried it into
[25627.62s -> 25631.14s]  the ground. He peed in the ground and buried it and then the soil sucked up the fucking
[25632.42s -> 25636.26s]  ammonia that's in the piss. He was clean and whatever. I don't know. I saw like a,
[25636.26s -> 25650.81s]  I've watched that like a year. All right, we're gonna have to have important people up here. Put
[25650.81s -> 25663.42s]  people in front. This isn't gonna take forever. That's fine. Just stuff everybody up here. Come
[25663.42s -> 25671.37s]  on. Push through. He's thought about this already. No, Bear Grylls peed into the ground. He dug a
[25671.37s -> 25676.90s]  hole and he peed into it and he waited like three days or something. And then when he opened up the
[25676.90s -> 25682.81s]  hole, the pee was clean. Something like that happened. Something like that happened. I don't
[25682.81s -> 25687.93s]  know. Something weird like that. What was it? I'm telling you. It was like there was pee in the
[25687.93s -> 25694.68s]  ground and it was like he buried it. And on the third day his piss rose. Nothing like that happened.
[25694.68s -> 25706.90s]  What? That was one episode. Yes, I know. Why do people think I'm crazy? I swear to God this happened.
[25721.56s -> 25731.05s]  Jett is so dumb is what somebody said. No, he did not do that. He did not pee.
[25734.31s -> 25740.33s]  He did not pee up. He's such a shitty survival technique.
[25741.21s -> 25751.43s]  Imagine telling somebody to just sit down in the air. No, that's not how you survive.
[25751.43s -> 25772.46s]  That didn't happen. All right, we need. Where's my blood going? Get in there. Get in there and cause
[25772.46s -> 25779.19s]  a mayhem. You need to cause a mayhem. Turn around. What are you getting? See the person behind you?
[25779.19s -> 25797.13s]  Spaghetti. Turn around Mr. Spaghetti. All right, now you're in the way. What year is this? I knew
[25797.13s -> 25802.49s]  that was going to piss so many people off. I knew that was going to just piss like a thousand people
[25802.49s -> 25825.03s]  off. The second they heard the gay was just like, no, shut up. Dream is dehydrated.
[25826.87s -> 25849.67s]  Don't worry. I'll take care of that in a minute. 17 max stamina. Nice, man. Pretty cool. Nice.
[25849.67s -> 25855.46s]  Actually, I'm starting to lose my mind. Whatever. It's the maggot layer. It does it to you.
[25859.61s -> 25873.85s]  You are making me want some water though. What's your guys favorite water?
[25874.57s -> 25885.58s]  Favorite like bottle of water. Am I a rich asshole if I say Fiji? No, a lot of people are saying it.
[25886.14s -> 25891.93s]  A lot of people are saying it. No, a lot of people are saying it. I saw like at least a
[25891.93s -> 25906.52s]  hundred people say it. Guys, Fiji is filtered with rocks. It naturally gets filtered over the
[25906.52s -> 25932.65s]  sediment of the rocks. Now you're going to tell me that's fake too. Don't die. You're going to be
[25932.65s -> 25950.15s]  in front of me. No, I'm not talking about every day. I'm talking about just like sometimes.
[25951.86s -> 25957.40s]  Sometimes I'll see it and I go, you know what? That sounds good. This isn't every day.
[25964.82s -> 25970.42s]  Drink smart water then. I don't think you want to say that. I think you just angered a lot of
[25970.42s -> 25975.46s]  people. I don't know what it is but for some reason if you don't drink water out of your tap
[25977.42s -> 25986.66s]  and you say, I like this. Careful. Like if you don't turn your bathtub on and turn your head
[25986.66s -> 25995.94s]  over and drink out of the bathtub apparently you're a crazy person. Are you guys drinking out of a
[25995.94s -> 26005.77s]  garden hose? Yeah, seriously. No, you know, I don't drink tap water. It has fluorine in it. I don't
[26005.77s -> 26029.66s]  want that. No, I clicked an ad one time and it told me that I don't want fluorine. I was like,
[26029.66s -> 26043.75s]  all right. I don't want that. I stopped buying it. Stop drinking it. This place sucks. It really
[26043.75s -> 26064.31s]  does. Will somebody get up there? I'm so glad I have these mages. I need potions. All right.
[26064.31s -> 26086.62s]  15. Just stick it in there. Whatever. Not a bad thing. I mean L runes, they drop like rain.
[26086.62s -> 26096.36s]  It'd be fine. Yeah, just whatever. I'm going to do it. That's 15 plus. There's more defense
[26096.36s -> 26106.02s]  and light radius. It's fine. I did level up but I have to get to the end of this. I bet that's
[26106.02s -> 26117.14s]  damaged. My tap water is hard water and it's awful tasting. Yes, I agree. Vegas has really hard water.
[26118.10s -> 26140.54s]  It smells like rust. You got hard water too. Yeah, that's why this filter exists. You don't
[26140.54s -> 26157.34s]  want to, you know, I don't, I don't want to drink rust. German misses the East Coast.
[26162.10s -> 26165.94s]  I'm not sure I necessarily would have wanted to drink that much tap water in Massachusetts either.
[26167.06s -> 26170.34s]  I don't think Massachusetts has very good water. I'm pretty sure it ranks kind of low.
[26171.30s -> 26184.02s]  I'm pretty sure tap water in Boston is really not that great.
[26185.38s -> 26200.42s]  Go dig a hole if you want clean water. I need more mages. Here we go. Here comes the fun part
[26200.42s -> 26211.86s]  where we sit here while a hundred flies get stuck in the wall. Is anybody even up there?
[26211.86s -> 26229.34s]  All right, I'm going to put you up here. Get in there. Fight. Nice aim play. It's at this point
[26229.34s -> 26239.27s]  that I will agree with you. These guys are immune to physical damage. That's why. I've got a guy
[26239.27s -> 26255.80s]  immune to physical. That sucks. The mages have to kill this guy. Oh, he loved that one.
[26255.80s -> 26280.79s]  Come on, mages. Get him. All right. I made it through. All right. All right. Okay. Okay.
[26280.79s -> 26296.30s]  Let's get some more mages. All right. Kill moonbiting. Jesus. I get two hits.
[26298.14s -> 26327.82s]  I got to sell. Hey, I can make one. And four to seven cold damage. Oh, man. Nice.
[26328.62s -> 26341.99s]  That's three rings, right? To make an amulet. Yes, it is. Filter tier list. How does that even work?
[26341.99s -> 26372.10s]  It's like five. I got to get a bunch of these. I am starting to run out of mana. All right. Let
[26372.10s -> 26382.62s]  me get through the maggot layer and then we can do points. Yeah. Level three is probably up here.
[26384.44s -> 26394.42s]  Yeah. If I was a sorceress and I had teleport, you know, I really just wish I was a sorceress,
[26394.42s -> 26411.77s]  to be honest. Who had a sword? Oh, fuck. You're right. Well, you're not. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[26416.46s -> 26434.09s]  Not as good. Not as good. Kind of sucks. If you had teleport, you would teleport into death.
[26435.21s -> 26443.93s]  Also kind of true. It is. Yeah, I would teleport into a bunch of enemies and die.
[26445.61s -> 26457.78s]  Link vessel notice. I saw the tier list. David, I do tier list all the time.
[26458.50s -> 26470.46s]  I'm not going to do it right now. Come on. Just get me to the next level.
[26472.76s -> 26476.65s]  Claw of Fire for Temple is actually going to be painful. It's not in here either. Shit.
[26477.45s -> 26496.41s]  Let me in. Let me in. What tier is hose water? Of all the tap water, hose water is probably up
[26496.41s -> 26511.24s]  pretty high. I would say. There's something about taking a hose that's turned on and tilting it so
[26511.24s -> 26518.46s]  it makes that arcing fountain and just putting your mouth up and they really can't be beat. I
[26518.46s -> 26531.75s]  would put that pretty high on the list. Hose water is dangerous. Why? Hose water can kill you.
[26536.76s -> 26553.10s]  Does bacteria and mold in it. What's with all the Debbie Downers? I have a Berkey.
[26553.74s -> 26559.02s]  Berkey suck. Not even real. I love drinking out of a hose on a hot summer day. It's going to kill
[26559.02s -> 26589.10s]  you. Bananas are my favorite fruit. Radioactive gross. I got this ridge wallet. Oh shit. Too
[26589.10s -> 26614.81s]  expensive. It is. But still, an honest shill. No, I was a shill in my dream, but I was not
[26614.81s -> 26632.49s]  a shill in real life for that. Hold on a second. Am I getting told? How many, let's be honest,
[26632.49s -> 26636.90s]  how many of you guys do vape? How many of you guys have a jewel in your pocket right now?
[26642.54s -> 26650.81s]  I know a lot of you do. I know you can get pneumonia from fucking vaping. You know that,
[26650.81s -> 26685.38s]  right? Fake news. I stopped, okay? Good. Everyone thinks his fan base is all Zoomers. Well,
[26685.38s -> 26689.54s]  considering how many of you guys didn't know the game I was playing until about two hours ago,
[26689.54s -> 26704.58s]  yeah, sometimes. Don't run forward here. This is bad. This is a boss in here.
[26705.46s -> 26720.55s]  It's the 1999 Zoomers. Are you a Zoomer if you're 1999? What's the cutoff here?
[26721.11s -> 26727.99s]  I thought it was like 97 or something. Like 96. What's the cutoff here? Yeah, it's 97, isn't it?
[26728.79s -> 26744.97s]  96 is probably the cutoff. You guys get such an interesting
[26745.85s -> 26755.66s]  childhood. Think of all the stuff that's been developed in the last 15 years. I mean, we went
[26755.66s -> 26763.88s]  from, I went from like the regular Nintendo to cell phones, but the cell phones were kind of shitty.
[26763.88s -> 26771.48s]  You know what I'm saying? We got iPhones. We got like, I was going to say Google Stadia,
[26772.28s -> 26777.08s]  but that would be not, that's not a very good, that's not a very good thing to say for a tech,
[26777.96s -> 26783.40s]  but I don't know why I was going to say Stadia. You know, we've got cell phones. We've got Stadia
[26783.40s -> 26802.22s]  now. Like, that's such a big deal. No, Google, this is a long play for Google, guys. I know
[26802.22s -> 26808.23s]  Google makes a product and then pretends it doesn't exist like two years later, but really
[26809.61s -> 26819.70s]  there, I'm going to die. Fine. They are waiting for when the internet is a hundred times better
[26819.70s -> 26825.58s]  than it is now, but they can be the first people that has the streaming video game console
[26825.58s -> 26830.79s]  in 30 years. We've heard this before. We've heard you say this before. Yeah, but not everyone was
[26830.79s -> 26851.27s]  here. This could be completely different audience. All right, this is it. Get everybody in here.
[26851.27s -> 26859.53s]  Respawn everybody. Get up here. He ran into things to say. Listen, I never run into things to say.
[26860.41s -> 26884.55s]  I can talk all day. We know, we know. He kind of ruined my thing. I was going to not talk for like
[26884.55s -> 26905.93s]  five minutes. He spent an hour talking about expensive water. It's expensive water. Sorry,
[26905.93s -> 26913.56s]  the term is airport water. Airport water. Come on. Why do you drink at the airport?
[26914.12s -> 26946.98s]  Okay, watch out. All right. Low and slow, low and slow, low and slow. Like a pot roast. Good.
[26948.92s -> 26950.92s]  Oh man, there's so many people in here. All right. I need more
[26952.74s -> 26964.10s]  Mano. Big mommy bug. That's right. Eggs everywhere and shit. This is why this place sucks.
[26964.98s -> 26972.28s]  Ring. Come on, give me something better than that. If I didn't have all these people,
[26972.28s -> 26979.13s]  can you imagine this is solo, right? Imagine if 40 or 50 things were shooting at me at the same time.
[27002.30s -> 27010.28s]  All right, immune to cold and all of my majors are cold. So that's good.
[27016.79s -> 27027.82s]  Done. Staff of Kings. I remember when I first played this game with friends a long time ago.
[27029.32s -> 27034.90s]  I mean, it's not a terrible, very fast attack speed. It's two-handed, but I remember a friend
[27034.90s -> 27040.57s]  of mine used this. They had this equipped for a very long time and they didn't realize
[27041.61s -> 27047.98s]  they were running around with this thing on. And I had to try to tell them that that's not what it,
[27047.98s -> 27053.61s]  you don't use this thing. It's part of a, it's the thing is though, it's really pretty good.
[27053.61s -> 27065.06s]  Look at how fast the swings for a two-hander. That's really great. But they used it for a long
[27065.06s -> 27075.56s]  time and they couldn't figure out how to get out of act two. Why not use it because you have to
[27075.56s -> 27097.08s]  get rid of it to get out of act two and quotes his friend and that person. Oh, let's make a,
[27097.08s -> 27110.87s]  let's make an amulet. That's funny that you can use it at all. You can use the hammer too from act
[27110.87s -> 27123.70s]  one. Can we take a pee break? You can take a pee break when I level up again, cause it'll be about
[27123.70s -> 27129.82s]  five straight minutes of us picking stuff. So you'll have that opportunity very soon.
[27131.91s -> 27138.60s]  Old resist is more important than magic fine right now. Cause it's burial 59 old resist.
[27141.50s -> 27148.87s]  All right. We're almost there. Almost at Daryl. Please. I have to go so bad. We'll just,
[27148.87s -> 27177.21s]  just go. It's okay. You guys are good. All right. Now we need the, uh, the head, which is in the,
[27177.21s -> 27185.00s]  the, it's a little bit further out. It's the last one. Did I get the far always this waypoint?
[27185.00s -> 27207.86s]  I don't remember. I did not. I think we're going to ask them. All right. We're going to go through,
[27207.86s -> 27213.24s]  we got to do, we got to do some running here. You can go now. You could actually go now.
[27214.04s -> 27248.12s]  We got running to do our ways and we're looking for Valley of the snakes. Don't make any plus
[27248.12s -> 27254.26s]  two jokes while I'm away. All right. I won't. All right. See you in a minute.
[27254.26s -> 27278.47s]  Hey, thanks for the, thanks for the three. Thanks for the free stock market bump.
[27281.46s -> 27294.81s]  What's with the strange darkness? Must find the valley of the snakes. Plus two omega lulam
[27295.37s -> 27302.04s]  dying. What have you were? What have you were though? Like what have you were?
[27302.76s -> 27313.43s]  What if you were laughing so hard? All right. Don't be a dickhead.
[27313.83s -> 27325.16s]  All right. I got to ask this dude bedtime. That's pretty early. I'm just, I just want to,
[27325.16s -> 27349.21s]  I'm just playing it. I just love this game. We're going on eight hours. I know, but I mean,
[27349.21s -> 27353.29s]  it might not be everybody's cup of tea right now, but I mean, I really do love this game.
[27357.69s -> 27360.65s]  It's just so funny. I'm glad you guys got to participate.
[27373.51s -> 27379.90s]  Should enjoy what you're playing. Yeah. So, so this, the rest of the week for like the next
[27379.90s -> 27394.02s]  five days in a row, only this. All right. Thanks. Yeah. Cool. Thanks. Thanks for permission. Yes.
[27394.82s -> 27405.22s]  It's taken a lot longer to kill things though. That's sort of, that's starting to concern me a
[27405.22s -> 27413.10s]  little, just a little getting a small amount of concern and how long it's taking me to kill
[27413.10s -> 27429.69s]  anyone. You got two levels up. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Oh, there's an ancient tunnel here.
[27429.69s -> 27448.73s]  There could be a chest. Who cares? Oh, can I go up? Yes. This is still on hardcore.
[27448.73s -> 27473.88s]  I've not given up on that one yet. It's the price for a wink at 75,000 channel points.
[27473.88s -> 27486.52s]  Alley of the snakes. Come on. I'm going to sneak. Don't kill me by a trap. That would be,
[27486.52s -> 27488.92s]  that would be, I'm going to sneeze. I can't pay attention. I'm going to sneeze.
[27489.80s -> 27506.38s]  I promise that was real. All right. Where the hell am I? I don't have any anecdotes.
[27517.02s -> 27568.28s]  Kill something. Will somebody die? Somebody die to the wink. Thanks for the free wink.
[27568.28s -> 27580.68s]  Yeah. You go. I'm devaluing the winks by accidentally giving up free winks. That's not good.
[27581.32s -> 27605.32s]  Alley of the snakes. I don't want to influence the vote or anything, but I'm going to say this as a,
[27605.40s -> 27609.08s]  I'm going to say the first letter of each word that I'm trying to tell you.
[27613.11s -> 27662.82s]  I W L I Y E 2 P I S M. That's his wifi password. It's DaVinci code. Shit. Where's this loss?
[27662.82s -> 27668.66s]  No, where's the valley of the snakes? I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need
[27668.66s -> 27676.09s]  it. I want to filter some water and also review the filters on stream and then maybe pee in the
[27676.09s -> 27693.77s]  filters. Not quite. Not, not really that close. Try again and then maybe drink the filters.
[27695.80s -> 27701.56s]  Where's this? I need a valley. I thought it was up here. I'm wrong. That was not it.
[27704.18s -> 27712.55s]  Honestly, that was so long ago. I didn't even know what it was. I lived my life in dog years, guys.
[27715.29s -> 27720.49s]  Like one year is seven years for a dog. It's kind of the same way. Like one minute is like 45 minutes
[27720.49s -> 27751.27s]  for me in my brain. Wait, six sockets. Let's go. Actually, these sell for a lot. I can gamble.
[27763.59s -> 27770.26s]  Valley of the snakes. Looking for valley of the snake. Just want to find it.
[27777.69s -> 27782.41s]  Oh God. Don't let this be the end. Don't let this be the end. Don't let this be the end. Don't
[27782.41s -> 27798.36s]  let this be the end. Yeah, these sell for, look at how much these sell for. Let's go gamble.
[27798.36s -> 27824.46s]  Just tuned in. Is it the end? No, not yet. I'm, I'm still all right. I'm still chilling.
[27825.26s -> 27835.42s]  The stream has been chill enough where it's not like I'm like exhausted right now. I still got my
[27835.42s -> 27844.62s]  guy. Yeah, we'll level up too. Some gambling. I need, what's the worst thing I have? I need boots.
[27845.42s -> 27850.78s]  Boots in an offhand or something. Boots. These boots are so bad. These are like level three.
[27852.63s -> 27879.86s]  Level three boots. I could probably get a better weapon too. They're better. Not by very much,
[27879.86s -> 27901.46s]  but they are. Ooh. Magic find is crazy good in this game. Once you cross one to 200% magic find,
[27902.70s -> 27913.98s]  rares, sets, and uniques drop all the fucking time. I'll wear them. I'll put a better helm.
[27913.98s -> 27930.94s]  Yeah. Try to get a helmet. Here we go. Two sockets. 22, 25. Hold resist.
[27933.10s -> 27944.04s]  I could put some stuff in. There's two sockets in here. Do you want to try for something else?
[27944.68s -> 27971.66s]  Maybe a weapon. This thing's level six. Oh, it's gotta be one-handed. One-handed. Three to 19.
[27977.93s -> 27983.16s]  What are you guys talking about? My job after streaming? What do you mean? I don't like turn
[27983.16s -> 27991.14s]  off the stream and go to work. What? Wait, is he going to go to his job that led to today?
[27999.05s -> 28011.74s]  He's not relatable. What do you mean I'm not relatable? 12. All right. No more. All right,
[28011.74s -> 28019.85s]  that's it. These all suck. Last one. Terrible. Terrible. Let's go. All right. I got 10 points
[28019.85s -> 28022.49s]  to put in. Where do you want me to put them? Take a look at what we have so far. Remember,
[28022.49s -> 28029.29s]  strength is damage and gear. Dexterity is attack rating, hit chance, defense, health, stamina,
[28030.01s -> 28042.15s]  just mana. That's all it does. He got fired. No, I've actually never been fired from a job in my life
[28042.15s -> 28053.80s]  because it never happened. All right. Where do you want to put 10 points? Take a look. Which one?
[28053.80s -> 28063.85s]  You're going to get fired from streaming if I pee in a filter on stream.
[28064.65s -> 28080.01s]  So yeah, we'll make it one out of one. All right. So it seems like now we're actively trying to
[28080.01s -> 28093.26s]  fuck up the whole thing. Okay. I mean, this is what if you guys want to do, but I'm an engineering
[28093.26s -> 28115.50s]  school. What are you talking about? Engineering school. All right. Five, four, three, two, one.
[28115.50s -> 28121.27s]  Dexterity. It is 10 points into dexterity. I might as well pick up a bow if you're going to do that
[28121.27s -> 28143.06s]  shit. You're not having enough meltdown, so it's all has to go into dex. Aye, aye, aye. All right.
[28143.06s -> 28146.98s]  Take a look. This is what we've got so far. Remember, blue means it's being, there's plus
[28146.98s -> 28154.57s]  skills on it. So if you like, what the fuck is that blue, dude? We have two points to spend.
[28154.65s -> 28173.77s]  There are two points that we can spend. I don't want to influence the vote at all, but you know,
[28173.77s -> 28184.20s]  we have poison of bone. Here are the curses. You know where they are. Bone wall. It already has two
[28184.20s -> 28193.19s]  points in it. All right. Where do you want to go? First point. Pick a category on the right. Bone
[28193.19s -> 28256.20s]  wall. You already fucked up his dex. Yes, they did. Okay. Summoning. Hmm. Better skeletons.
[28256.20s -> 28269.51s]  Skeleton mastery. Is that where you guys are going? Okay. What about point number two?
[28269.51s -> 28273.75s]  What about point number two? Please pick a category on the right if you want to pick a new
[28273.75s -> 28286.42s]  one. You know, I'm sorry I just hit you in the mouth. Don't get mad at me. I guess you don't
[28286.42s -> 28294.58s]  want to pick a category. We'll just choose, okay. Nobody wants to pick a new category. They want to
[28294.58s -> 28321.82s]  stay right here. So we're going double skeleton mastery. Okay. All right. I may have done it a
[28321.82s -> 28327.78s]  little differently, you know, if it were me playing. For me playing. But you know, going from,
[28328.74s -> 28332.50s]  you know, increasing life and damage. Let's say for instance, 13 to 14 damage.
[28333.86s -> 28341.54s]  16 to 17. Bank again. Skeleton mastery again. 19 to 20 damage. And they'll live longer. They
[28341.54s -> 28346.89s]  have higher defense. I mean, it's not a terrible play. I don't think. This is the same build you
[28346.89s -> 28366.28s]  were going to make anyways. No, it is not. Some of this is all wrong. We don't know. We don't know.
[28366.28s -> 28379.46s]  We don't know anything about the game. Okay. Cool. Tell us what you would like so we can avoid it.
[28380.50s -> 28386.26s]  Well, I said skeleton mastery was better. And everybody clicked it. We want to have what's up
[28386.26s -> 28405.86s]  to you. Hey, how do I oceans are all right. Snakes. Holy shit. What happened here? Oh, right,
[28405.86s -> 28410.82s]  right, right, right. Okay. Yeah, I panicked and left. I forgot about this.
[28411.62s -> 28437.59s]  I forgot about this. Oh, heal him, heal him, heal him. You can drop a potion on companions
[28437.59s -> 28441.83s]  and heal them. I just didn't do it to Kyle because I didn't care because he was like level five.
[28441.83s -> 28444.87s]  We were fighting with level 15 enemies. So it was not even worth doing that.
[28460.62s -> 28489.29s]  Still no Valley. Is that a little spot up there? Did I miss a spot up here? Am I crazy? Yep. It's
[28489.29s -> 28497.16s]  actually probably right over here. You missed a spot. Alt tab and turn off your computer.
[28497.88s -> 28503.27s]  One of these days, somebody is going to say something like that and I'm just going to do it.
[28503.27s -> 28532.89s]  But no, no skeletons are dying. Please. I'm stuck here. What happened? What do you mean?
[28532.89s -> 28547.24s]  He's stuck here. How is it possible to be stuck in that chair? Did you, are you like,
[28549.16s -> 28576.73s]  are you like bare ass sitting on a wet piece of ice? What happened? There it is. There it is.
[28576.73s -> 28609.19s]  There it is. Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it. Yeah. I miss Frank. Yeah. We don't have any
[28609.19s -> 28614.82s]  dead rising friends. How would we just, I just played that like a month or two ago.
[28623.56s -> 28630.82s]  We don't have any dead rising friends. Friends. Is that what I said? I'm going to beat Darryl
[28630.82s -> 28658.76s]  first try and then I'm going to alt tab my computer. Ooh. I think that this is a quick one.
[28658.76s -> 28670.42s]  It's just right on level two. Oh no. I feel the arcane sanctuary forgot. We can't just skip that
[28670.42s -> 28695.90s]  part. Arcane sanctuary is so bad. Look at five, three. Yeah. Look at this. Look at how much these
[28695.90s -> 28704.18s]  guys are staying alive now. There's so much beef here. We can increase their potential by 40%
[28705.74s -> 28719.64s]  overnight. Overnight. Easy. All right. Everyone get in there. All right. Here comes the battle.
[28720.44s -> 28741.82s]  What's my hit chance on these guys? I'm curious. 95%. Okay. That seems way higher than I thought
[28741.82s -> 28760.42s]  it was. No level two in here. Bone mage gang. I think it's pretty much all bone. All bone gang.
[28761.46s -> 28771.10s]  Not just mages. There's random hell. Tonight I'm going to sleep. Well, maybe we'll see it tomorrow
[28771.74s -> 28782.36s]  or the next day or whenever. Have a good sleep. Period. Two hit a sword. Hold on.
[28784.54s -> 28808.74s]  It's 17. Two sockets. Crash. Plus two to weaken. No, crash. It's in there. First kill it.
[28809.62s -> 28831.37s]  Worth using? No. It's probably right here. I always hate when it's right next to the door.
[28843.67s -> 28850.07s]  I have to train them around. I'm going to get stuck on somebody.
[28850.71s -> 28890.76s]  Hmm. It could have ended very badly. How do I hate gold? Um, no. Ask him. Deflect him.
[28890.76s -> 28915.64s]  Sometimes there's so many people in them. Get in. Get in. Why does your mouth taste like blood?
[28916.89s -> 28921.96s]  Because you bit your lip. You're chewing too fast and you're trying to eat your food too quickly.
[28923.08s -> 28978.68s]  Slow down. The drank from the 5G garden hose. All right. Level two is very quick. Right here.
[28978.68s -> 28989.96s]  No, it's not. I thought it was right around the corner. It's not. How long is the stream going to
[28989.96s -> 28999.93s]  be? Um, I don't know. I don't know. Probably not that much longer. I don't think. Probably not
[28999.93s -> 29009.61s]  much longer. But I, I, I got addicted to Diablo 2. Which I kind of knew this was going to happen.
[29010.33s -> 29033.19s]  Let's go. Right to the end. Oh, is it not over here? Seems impossible. It's right on there.
[29033.19s -> 29038.38s]  Again, see, look at this. Look at the RNG I'm getting here. It's in the one spot again
[29038.38s -> 29051.67s]  that I didn't look. The one place. He's not going to be able to play D2 online with us.
[29053.85s -> 29067.18s]  Um, well, not with this character, but, and I don't, yeah. What does a Vic have for armor?
[29067.18s -> 29073.75s]  Actually, I don't think anything. Actually nothing. So, um, just here. Put this on.
[29074.63s -> 29091.56s]  The skeletons are us. Yeah. Think of it that way. I still seriously can't believe I got fucking banned
[29091.56s -> 29096.81s]  from this game. I don't think I've ever been banned from my whole life. All right. Be careful
[29096.81s -> 29102.09s]  here. This is, this is danger. I've never been banned from a fucking video game ever. I never
[29102.09s -> 29109.82s]  had any problems. I got banned from Diablo 2. All right. Okay. This is actually slow down.
[29110.46s -> 29127.94s]  They can run up on you real quick. This place on any, on a higher difficulty than normal,
[29127.94s -> 29138.55s]  it's hell. It's so bad. I've been spawn camped in this room on hell and had to restart the game
[29138.55s -> 29161.86s]  like more than three or four times. Isn't this game hell though? I mean, yeah. There he is.
[29161.94s -> 29178.63s]  Bang skin. Get. We've completed the staff. Here's the amulet. The amulet.
[29183.18s -> 29188.33s]  Amulet of Kings. Ten life, ten mana poison resistance.
[29188.33s -> 29193.16s]  I thought we were going to turn into the staff anyways.
[29197.22s -> 29204.42s]  Time to die. Die. Time to die. Die. How do I do that? When is it again?
[29204.50s -> 29220.52s]  Time to die. Time to die. Die. Time to die. Help. Help me. Help. Help me. This is for you.
[29220.52s -> 29233.16s]  Where is it? Run. Help. There it is. Help me. Help me. Help. Me. Me.
[29243.18s -> 29263.27s]  I know all the voice lines from samurai warriors to empires. All right. The horodric staff.
[29264.23s -> 29268.09s]  Excellent. You have horodric staff.
[29280.22s -> 29283.74s]  I can now go to the castle. The castle? The palace castle.
[29289.40s -> 29301.72s]  Let's get some actual armor and weapons for this guy. How about a trident? Trident? Yeah.
[29303.75s -> 29309.40s]  And a regular shitty helmet. And that's fine.
[29315.08s -> 29321.24s]  3096. That's pretty good, actually. We're going to talk to
[29322.36s -> 29336.38s]  Brogdan. The potions are fine. This path of exile is similar to this. I would say very.
[29337.02s -> 29344.90s]  The path of exile is a little newer. This is pretty dated. It still does very, very well.
[29344.90s -> 29351.06s]  Still holds up very well. Somebody said they bet 50 channel points that I die to the arcane dudes.
[29351.86s -> 29363.48s]  Researching the old records. Trying to find the location of Tal Rasha's tomb. Only 50?
[29366.46s -> 29371.67s]  I may have a good lead for you. Great Viserai Summoner. Yeah. I'm going to go to the.
[29371.67s -> 29378.15s]  Build a summoner. Find a. I hate this part. Look in the arc. Look for the arcane sanctuary
[29378.15s -> 29401.93s]  within the palace. I do have a lot of friends, though. Builds to join me within the safety of
[29401.93s -> 29411.54s]  the palace. All was fine until one night. All right. Get the staff into Tal Rasha's tomb.
[29411.54s -> 29421.64s]  Find Tal Rasha's tomb. Here we go. Who do you hate more, Vinny or Joel?
[29422.68s -> 29428.86s]  You know you just love when you get RNG like this one. Level two. Let's go.
[29442.87s -> 29448.09s]  Why do I have to hate someone? Is there a reason why I have to hate someone?
[29448.73s -> 29456.07s]  It's the part of the game where I become kind of useless. I'm not going to be able to hurt anything.
[29456.71s -> 29466.06s]  I don't have any moves, but I do have friends that can hurt for me.
[29469.34s -> 29485.30s]  Is it down here? I think the red dead stream when he just showed up. Yeah, that was funny.
[29486.10s -> 29492.55s]  There it is again. Nice. Quickly doing this. Good because arcane sanctuary is a pain in the ass.
[29492.55s -> 29513.94s]  So I'm glad to get this out of the way. I need one more mage. The whole team is here now.
[29519.38s -> 29523.88s]  Oh, Vinny is here. I wish that red dead stream worked better, but it's always good to play
[29523.88s -> 29532.89s]  games with you, Jeremo. What's going on, Vinny? Good to see you. Look at this. We're getting such
[29532.89s -> 29543.75s]  good random roles. Vinny, I'd love to play Diablo 2 with you, but I'm not sure if you're here,
[29543.75s -> 29548.15s]  but I've been shadow banned from Diablo 2 for a reason I can't figure out why.
[29549.11s -> 29563.82s]  I have to buy, I have to have a new account. It's weird. Yeah, I don't know. Who knows?
[29571.03s -> 29582.31s]  He got reported for GlideWrapper. I went off. I went off. I talked a little bit about Blizzard
[29582.31s -> 29596.68s]  earlier, but if I actually got banned for trying to get their game to run, like get out of here.
[29596.68s -> 29612.50s]  No, don't want to go that way. I'm so starved of stamina. So bad. I streamed this last year
[29612.50s -> 29616.58s]  and I still love it. I was not banned. However, I'm glad I'm glad to hear you weren't banned.
[29625.37s -> 29630.18s]  I usually play this game once every couple of years. Once every two or three years,
[29630.18s -> 29634.26s]  I'll just turn this on and do act one and then uninstall it. It happens like every couple of
[29634.26s -> 29639.19s]  years. I don't think there's ever a time where I was like, you know, I'm going to install a
[29639.19s -> 29658.90s]  level 99 cheats. I think so. It's just kind of what you do with this game. If anyone's
[29658.90s -> 29664.42s]  been keeping track, I think that's like the 12th or 15th composite rare bow in a row.
[29665.22s -> 29680.49s]  Can I get anything else? That'd be happy. Act one is the ugliest environment.
[29682.31s -> 29688.38s]  I would say act three is probably uglier than act one. Act three has a couple of places that
[29688.38s -> 29705.18s]  have just and they spread out weirdly. Speedrun time. Let's go. This better not kill me. This
[29705.18s -> 29710.18s]  better not kill me. This better not kill me. This better not kill me. Okay. Don't open that
[29710.18s -> 29716.36s]  door. Don't open that door. Vic, don't open that door. Look how smart you are. I'm so glad that
[29716.36s -> 29727.80s]  you're smarter than the pizza because the pizza just opens every single door. All right. I'll open
[29727.80s -> 29734.81s]  the door now. Now that we're all here. Can I even open this door? You can't even open this door.
[29736.57s -> 29743.61s]  Wait. Yes, you can. What? I couldn't do it before.
[29749.16s -> 29752.60s]  This is an honest, this is a mistake to do. I found it. It's right there. It's right there.
[29753.24s -> 29756.12s]  Okay. I got to go up and then left. Make sure you have stamina for this shit.
[29761.22s -> 29777.99s]  Ah, almost got it. You almost got it. That was close. It was real close. Quick do another one.
[29777.99s -> 29793.27s]  All right. Get in on our way to the arcane sanctuary. I hope I don't die here.
[29794.23s -> 29802.50s]  You know, if I wanted to, I could just completely game this stream
[29803.22s -> 29810.63s]  and I can turn the stream off whenever I want. Oh shit. I died in arcane sanctuary. Well,
[29810.63s -> 29817.13s]  hardcore. See, that's it. See you later. I'm not going to do that though.
[29841.61s -> 29850.09s]  Just going, just going. It's right here. Arcane sanctuary. Here we go. Find the journal.
[29851.13s -> 29854.26s]  I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension.
[29854.26s -> 29860.18s]  So if you don't know about arcane sanctuary, all this place works is you have four directions.
[29860.18s -> 29864.18s]  Usually you play this with four people or at least four or five people. Sometimes if you have eight,
[29864.74s -> 29870.34s]  that's great because you go in groups of two. It sucks because I'm alone. I got to do it in groups
[29870.34s -> 29876.81s]  of one and you pick a direction and you go all the way. It takes about 15 to 20 plus minutes per
[29876.81s -> 29898.89s]  direction. You might hit a dead end and only one of them is correct. Which way do I go?
[29898.89s -> 29909.69s]  And now we wait. Let us vote. What the fuck? Chat picks everything. What the fuck?
[29910.82s -> 29923.06s]  It's all good. You would have picked this way anyways. I got to go back to town.
[29934.66s -> 29943.27s]  Can't can do that for free, Jeremy. What the fuck are you doing? Not a bad helmet.
[29943.91s -> 29948.78s]  One of the decks are already terrible. Four to mana, get out of here. I need mana potions.
[29949.74s -> 29953.69s]  Yeah, you don't.
[29954.25s -> 29970.76s]  Jeremy is ignoring his viewers. Did you put the cube in your stash? Yeah, what? What? I don't like
[29970.76s -> 29988.84s]  it in here. I don't like the way it looks in here. It's free inventory space. I know, but I don't
[29988.84s -> 30001.67s]  like it in here. I remember back in the day, perfect skulls went for a lot. Let's do some stats.
[30007.59s -> 30011.58s]  You can see what we have so far. Five points going in what? Please decide.
[30012.54s -> 30027.35s]  Yeah, perfect. Have you had 20, 30 perfect skulls? They were pretty good currency. Yeah,
[30027.35s -> 30049.38s]  I'll show you the bones. I remember when FDR was president. All right, vitality. Good choice.
[30052.39s -> 30065.48s]  We also need a skill point here. So have we unlocked anything new? Not yet. No. Same deal.
[30066.12s -> 30073.51s]  We're almost at 10 points in Ray's skeleton. A bunch of random points in blood golem and
[30073.91s -> 30094.86s]  mastery. Just to give you a look at the category. And we are actually, we're going to kill Dariel
[30094.86s -> 30112.23s]  and I'm going to turn off the stream. It's going to be over after that. We're at eight and a half
[30112.23s -> 30127.85s]  hours. It's a long time. I'm not, I'm not aiming for another 13 hour stream today. All right,
[30127.85s -> 30149.91s]  we're in the same category. What do you want? What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing?
[30155.43s -> 30180.04s]  Uh, guys, guys. Okay. Strike three and I pick a strike three and I'm going to pick a skill.
[30180.04s -> 30206.15s]  This is strike three. Here it comes. You already picked summoning spells. You already, you guys
[30206.15s -> 30226.10s]  already picked the category. What is happening right now? We want to change category. Broken?
[30227.70s -> 30244.14s]  There are 320 votes so far. We want different category. We want new category, different
[30244.14s -> 30256.23s]  category, different category. Well, you picked it already. No, new category now. We want,
[30256.23s -> 30268.76s]  we want blood. I'm going to give you guys one more chance. If you really want to change categories,
[30268.76s -> 30278.12s]  this is your only opportunity. Otherwise, I'm picking something. All right, fine. Jesus.
[30279.08s -> 30313.03s]  Poison and bone. We're here. See? We made it. What do you want? Okay. Sure. Sure. Okay. So good.
[30313.03s -> 30332.20s]  Cool. I'm about to pick something. This isn't us, Jerma. This is bots. We're already here. You
[30332.20s -> 30354.89s]  don't, we're already in summoning spells. Someone else is doing this. He doesn't know. What would I
[30354.89s -> 30370.12s]  know? No, this isn't bots. Bots wouldn't do this. Okay. All right. All right. That's it. All right.
[30370.12s -> 30378.46s]  The stream's over. That's it. Pick something. Pick something. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, pick
[30378.46s -> 30381.42s]  something. Go, go, go, go, go, go, pick something. Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick,
[30381.42s -> 30410.94s]  go, go, go, go, go. Delta mage. Thanks for picking. Nice work. It only took you
[30411.90s -> 30421.51s]  six straight minutes to figure that out. I don't need two more points to get another mage to get
[30421.51s -> 30429.27s]  to four. I'm trying to artificially inflate, you know, how long the stream is. I see. I know
[30429.27s -> 30451.74s]  what you guys are doing. Back to the sanctuary. Am I going to play this again? I'll be honest.
[30451.74s -> 30472.92s]  I don't think this is going to last this long. So I mean, I'm still alive. I'm still alive. Although
[30472.92s -> 30483.30s]  I can probably give that 60. All right. Yeah. I'm going to give this to, uh, nice. Good. All right.
[30483.30s -> 30488.30s]  Let's get lucky here and have this be the right one. The first try. That's why you're doing the
[30488.30s -> 30505.05s]  TVs. What's going on on TV? All I can do is sit back here and just cast amplified damage and just
[30505.05s -> 30524.57s]  wait for them to die. I don't, I don't see it. I don't see it. In fact, I actually don't really
[30524.57s -> 30536.52s]  know what an ender dragon looks like. Five skeletons. There's four. What does the ender
[30536.52s -> 30541.61s]  dragon look like? I feel like I know what it looks like, but I don't at the same time.
[30542.73s -> 30556.82s]  Arcane sanctuary is also a place you cannot just run through. I wish it weren't the case,
[30556.82s -> 30561.86s]  but you have to actually play this because the corridors are three squares wide.
[30562.82s -> 30577.83s]  And we find the correct tomb of pal Russia. And then we kill durial and turn the stream off.
[30599.21s -> 30607.94s]  I'm just here to watch you die. Well, that would be a long nine hours. Wouldn't it just die to
[30607.94s -> 30619.27s]  durial. He sucks though. Durial socks. He just, it's a tiny little area. I don't know what the
[30619.27s -> 30624.15s]  hell I'm going to do. You know, I'm going to have to go in and here's the, his plan. The plan is
[30625.67s -> 30629.35s]  bring an absolute shitload amount of mana potions into the dungeon
[30630.31s -> 30636.79s]  and have durial just fight my blood golem. It's going to take like 30 minutes to kill him,
[30636.79s -> 30653.21s]  but that's the only thing I can do. You're really supposed to one hit kill you. No, he's not. I,
[30653.21s -> 30661.40s]  look at, I have 49 cold resist. I'll just stack it. Yeah. I'll just bone wall myself into a corner
[30662.20s -> 30668.01s]  and let the blood go. I just keep respawning the blood golem with like a hundred potions.
[30668.01s -> 30678.41s]  I'm going to fill every slot in my inventory with potions. Stop pretending. This isn't hard.
[30678.41s -> 30685.08s]  What have I done? What did I do wrong? I'm playing a summoning necromancer. What are you talking
[30685.08s -> 30693.70s]  about? What more am I supposed to do right now? What more am I supposed to do right now? I have
[30693.70s -> 30718.42s]  just a bunch of people. I can't do anything. Folks explosion is summoning building. Um, I just,
[30719.22s -> 30730.04s]  I don't have it. This is all I have. This is all I have to work with.
[30737.88s -> 30741.80s]  I mean, it wouldn't be chat picks everything. If I go, you know, let me sneak a corpse explosion
[30741.80s -> 30760.34s]  in here. That sounds good. I got lucky. I actually just got lucky. First try. Get them, get up the
[30760.34s -> 30764.57s]  stairs and get them. All right. If I, this is pinwheel. If I die to the summer, that's a
[30764.57s -> 30786.49s]  literally dying to pinwheel. Kill them. Somebody hit them with anything. All right. We're good.
[30789.75s -> 30796.46s]  It was oops. I just skipped everything. All right. We did it. Canyon of the Magi.
[30797.02s -> 30803.14s]  That didn't take 20 minutes. I was like, I'm really lucky. I didn't have to go through all
[30803.14s -> 30807.42s]  the portal shit. You don't know how annoying that could possibly have been.
[30812.04s -> 30815.08s]  Did you know the mage, the summoner is the mage from Diablo one? Yeah.
[30815.96s -> 30821.56s]  Faith will strengthen the courageous heart. I feel no pity for that would be summoner.
[30821.56s -> 30825.96s]  His terrible ambition for demonic power was pretty skilled. And you know, I already got it with,
[30827.54s -> 30832.89s]  uh, random and slayer. The reason why you have to go through all that is because there are a bunch
[30832.89s -> 30838.01s]  of dungeons that all have symbols in front of them. And this is the correct symbol. It's the only one
[30838.01s -> 30846.31s]  that has burial in it. Can't wait. I really hope I don't die here, but it would be a nine hour
[30846.31s -> 30860.52s]  fucking stream to just die to the act two boss. This is why hardcore sucks. All right. Do I have
[30860.52s -> 30886.07s]  any? Okay. 24 health in a helmet. Old resist. I don't have a shield. What do I have right now
[30886.07s -> 30897.90s]  for cold resistance? 49. That's not bad. Normal. That's okay. Let's go. But I played Diablo one.
[30898.94s -> 30905.34s]  Oh, Diablo one doesn't hold up for me like Diablo two does. It's still a good game,
[30906.14s -> 30918.94s]  but I can replay Diablo two many times. Make sure you bring the staff. Yep. I got it. Uh,
[30918.94s -> 30925.61s]  what do I put in here? I'm seeing what help in there. Okay. I'll get more rupees. I did it. It's
[30925.61s -> 30955.75s]  already done. Okay. Now I need a shitload of mana potions. Why can't you pop in this game
[30955.75s -> 30968.17s]  and don't you lose all your items? Remember people used to do, that was a scam that existed
[30968.17s -> 30974.18s]  back in the day. It was, Oh man, let me show you how to dupe. They said if you put the items that
[30974.18s -> 30980.74s]  you wanted on your character and you filled your body with potions like three times and died. Yeah.
[30980.74s -> 30984.58s]  And eventually if you die like three times with a full belt, full potions and everything and no
[30984.58s -> 30990.81s]  slots for anything, your character popped and all your items landed on the ground.
[30990.81s -> 30997.22s]  It was a lot of Diablo scams. Another scam in particular was the switcheroo. So there's only,
[30997.22s -> 31002.18s]  I think, three or four different pieces of art for Diablo twos, rings and amulets and weapons
[31002.18s -> 31008.78s]  and swords and stuff. So what would happen is somebody would, you had to check a box and that
[31008.78s -> 31014.10s]  other person had to check a box to be able to have a transaction go through. You both had a trade
[31014.10s -> 31018.58s]  window and somebody, let's say this was the stone of Jordan, one of the most sought after rings in
[31018.58s -> 31025.11s]  the whole game. And it would have this art because they all have the same art. They'd put it in.
[31025.11s -> 31030.87s]  Yeah, I want two worm skulls. You're like, okay. Yeah, sure. Here's my worm skull. Here it is.
[31030.87s -> 31036.71s]  And then I would check the box and they would go, Oh, hold on a second. I need some inventory
[31036.71s -> 31040.47s]  space. And they would get back and they do this bullshit. They'd walk over and pretend to go to
[31040.47s -> 31046.97s]  the fucking stash. And then they come back and they say, Okay, hey, and they'd go put it in the
[31046.97s -> 31051.70s]  window, check the box. And then you would put your thing in the window, check the box. And it was like,
[31052.42s -> 31066.22s]  Oh, no. Oh, and it was one of these. And this shit worked all the time. Why would you trade?
[31066.86s -> 31075.03s]  I don't know, because you don't, you don't. It's a scam. Scam. That's like saying, Oh, hey, dude,
[31075.03s -> 31080.79s]  when, when Microsoft calls you and tells you that the IRS is looking for $50 in iTunes gift cards,
[31080.79s -> 31095.91s]  what just, why do you do that? The scams work, man. This is how he was banned. No, this is shit
[31095.91s -> 31100.23s]  that happened like 20 years ago. I didn't do this shit. I was, I, it happened to me once.
[31101.11s -> 31112.26s]  I was like 14. I got scammed out of a pre patch worm skull. I told you guys that that thing was
[31112.26s -> 31116.98s]  worth a shit load. And I remember just DMing this person over and over again, telling them
[31116.98s -> 31127.05s]  that my brother gave it to me. That was a gift from my brother. I got scammed. Yeah, it was horrible.
[31129.10s -> 31132.38s]  And I say like me and my brother don't talk anymore. And that was like one of the things
[31132.38s -> 31137.80s]  that me and my brother did. And I, we love Diablo. We don't talk anymore. And sometimes he logs on
[31137.80s -> 31149.66s]  and like we play and that's his worm skull. And the guy was like, fuck off. And what I was saying was
[31149.66s -> 31163.37s]  total horse shit. But still, what a dick. I'm not even sure there was a report button in the game,
[31163.37s -> 31168.10s]  guys. See nowadays, when you play like League of Legends and somebody tells you to like, to go,
[31168.10s -> 31175.88s]  like, fuck you, buddy. You like report. Somebody sees it. And then that person gets into, I don't
[31175.88s -> 31184.18s]  think that even was possible. You could do the ring scam a hundred times. And it was just like,
[31184.18s -> 31196.38s]  that's the ring scam guy. There he is. He joined another server. I think you actually had to email
[31196.38s -> 31201.78s]  support. But I think there was a thing that said that you're not going to get your items back.
[31202.34s -> 31216.34s]  Uh, be careful. It worked though. All right. What was I doing? This. Prepare. Let's go kill
[31216.34s -> 31225.30s]  Duriel and then we'll turn off this ring. I'm ready. What's the symbol look like again? Circle
[31225.30s -> 31239.26s]  with the smiley underneath. Okay. All right. I hit the way point. I had a way point. What
[31239.26s -> 31245.93s]  am I doing? What the hell am I over here? He doesn't need a ring. He needs another ring.
[31249.66s -> 31256.30s]  All right. Is it weird that I don't give a shit because that ring is like plus one to maximum
[31256.30s -> 31269.64s]  damage or something. I'll find a better one. Probably right now. We aren't fighting anything.
[31269.64s -> 31295.29s]  Let's go. I know the symbol. Not the one. Not the one. There's a circle above it. Not the one.
[31296.17s -> 31308.38s]  Why do you keep ignoring gold? Because once you get to act four, act five, the gold is meaningless
[31308.38s -> 31324.30s]  in this game. Once you get to like nightmare act one, gold has no value. Don't die to this.
[31325.02s -> 31327.82s]  Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[31327.82s -> 31343.14s]  important. I got to. Okay. We need some skeletons and shit. I almost just walked in here with
[31343.14s -> 31367.61s]  nothing. Horrible. All right. Leveled up. Good for you. Don't run on this. Oh, there's a well.
[31367.61s -> 31379.48s]  Cranked on the well. Uh, wrong. Is there one more down here? I don't think so. Yes, there is.
[31380.44s -> 31411.43s]  Wrong. Uh, wrong. Right. There it is. Boss time. Because this is a pretty big apex of the stream
[31411.43s -> 31418.98s]  here. I want to know how many people have any confidence in me beating this. Let's see. Am I
[31418.98s -> 31445.06s]  going to beat Duriel? I'm actually curious. Yes. Yes. Yeah. All right. Actually we're getting a
[31445.06s -> 31462.90s]  lot of yeses. Okay. No more levels up. Oh boy. Easy. 75%. All right. Thanks for the confidence
[31462.90s -> 31473.02s]  boost. It's going to be very boring and you'll beat him and pretend it's hype. Oh, I turned off
[31473.02s -> 31489.54s]  hype trains by the way. You probably noticing why you haven't seen them. I turned mine off too.
[31492.25s -> 31501.86s]  Yeah, it's just, uh, this is going to be incredibly disappointing if he was. Um, yes,
[31501.86s -> 31506.02s]  it will be because that would be, it would be nine hours of a total waste of fucking time
[31506.02s -> 31528.41s]  because I can't log on to this character again. Let me in. What are you going to put in that
[31528.41s -> 31546.49s]  wallet now? What do you mean? Cause I turned off hype trains. I mean, it's, it's a, this is a tricky
[31546.49s -> 31554.86s]  zone. Oh, it's an, it's an interesting idea. It's just, even when you put it hard to do,
[31554.86s -> 31573.32s]  it still happens. And it's sort of just a game of focus on the game. All right. All right. All
[31573.32s -> 31579.61s]  right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have to do that. We're going to have to focus on the game.
[31579.61s -> 31585.05s]  Otherwise I'm going to die before getting to even to the holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.
[31586.89s -> 31614.76s]  Ring mail. That's a couple of greens. This is Arctic Arctic. Oh, it's angelic. Oh,
[31614.76s -> 31625.74s]  these little normal difficulty, shitty sets. I'll give it to you. I don't know what you have on.
[31645.82s -> 31653.86s]  Oh, scary room, scary room. No, no, Vic. He's dead. What the fuck is even in here doing that?
[31654.34s -> 31667.94s]  What the hell is in here? Nothing. Nothing. A whole lot of nothing. I'll get them back
[31667.94s -> 31699.40s]  before I did Daryl. Don't worry. I'm going to keep them alive. You're going to die to a chest trap.
[31700.04s -> 31708.65s]  You probably, that's why I'm not kicking over any chests. Cause that's bad. I don't want to die to
[31708.65s -> 31728.06s]  a chest trap. Kind of feel naked with a Vic. That aura was actually pretty key. All right.
[31728.06s -> 31749.59s]  Everybody get in here. Oh, oh my God. Oh my God. It's itching my eye. Hardcore is a horror,
[31749.59s -> 31757.10s]  especially in Act 2. Cause Act 2's light radius sucks. So you'll just open up one of these doors
[31757.10s -> 31762.28s]  and there's 40 people standing behind it, just waiting to kill you. And half of them shoot
[31762.28s -> 31771.72s]  lightning out of the rest. That's fun. Act 3 is not going to be any better. No, it won't.
[31772.36s -> 31788.55s]  They're doing all right. I think it's safe to get in here now and go for a kill myself.
[31789.35s -> 31805.62s]  Nothing. Anything dropped. Nothing good. Can't carry anymore. Anyway, bone wand. Let's take a look.
[31810.82s -> 31820.10s]  Uh, one to teeth. He's
[31834.33s -> 31850.90s]  laws. I have to go back to stay back when they die. Replace them. Five,
[31851.70s -> 31864.94s]  a number looking for a room with an, there's an orifice. Probably not this way, but let's go.
[31890.26s -> 31921.16s]  This is so bad. Jesus. I can't walk in here. How did you get back? Where are they coming from?
[31921.16s -> 31935.13s]  Where are they coming from? Back to town. Back to town. Tell this shit.
[31936.33s -> 31971.10s]  Oh, a man of potions. The ring. It's not whatever. All right. Let's go get our buddy back.
[31971.10s -> 31993.05s]  Good evening. $3,000 to bring you back. Come on. Stay alive. All right. Vic being here now.
[31993.05s -> 31996.97s]  We're going to be doing just fine. Everybody get in here and go and go.
[32001.72s -> 32014.14s]  Okay. How's everybody doing? Oh, party. I got to keep an eye on Vic's health because he's probably
[32014.14s -> 32022.76s]  the most important person here. You see this Vic shows up and it's just instant kills for people.
[32023.32s -> 32046.22s]  Another wink. What? That one hurt. Another stupid room where we just stuff in Vic. Get in there.
[32047.56s -> 32066.25s]  The only person here worth anything. All right. I'm going to get in there.
[32066.25s -> 32081.51s]  Now I'm going to go snipe the guy back here. Where am I going? Probably to the right.
[32081.51s -> 32096.81s]  All right. Let's go. Come on. We're almost there. Can't get lazy on hardcore either.
[32097.61s -> 32125.35s]  As long as Vic is in there. Hey, wink. Yeah, I can see the channel. I'm going in. Three, two, one.
[32130.62s -> 32139.48s]  Good. Yes, we are. Hang on. Right. Stay with me. Don't attack the one person over there.
[32139.48s -> 32167.48s]  I'll be idiots. I got to get back. I'm just replenishing. Good.
[32168.52s -> 32172.49s]  This is summoning Necro right here. This isn't what it's all about.
[32173.29s -> 32183.27s]  You just don't do anything. Well, if you're at a party with a summoning Necro, it's great
[32184.23s -> 32190.58s]  because all the minions just eat every hit and you just create just a smash on people.
[32197.48s -> 32212.20s]  My almost done. Poison Nova Necro is fun too. Yeah. Because you just run in a room,
[32212.20s -> 32218.78s]  right click and then run away and just let everything die. You have to do every synergy
[32218.78s -> 32236.23s]  though or you're useless in hell. I can sell this. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[32239.90s -> 32256.49s]  Vic, careful. Nice. How many players do I have to sit on? Still four.
[32257.45s -> 32277.45s]  I just leveled up. Maybe the Spear is better. Two to 24. No. Old Resist though. Here. Is this
[32277.45s -> 32299.06s]  better than 32 to 92? That's better. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to just check over here.
[32299.62s -> 32309.70s]  Just I want to look. It might be right here. Oh, God damn it. This place is huge. This place is
[32309.70s -> 32347.45s]  enormous. Too many people. Sweat check. Not really. Take a hit. One hit would be pretty deadly here.
[32357.67s -> 32378.18s]  This game is a God damn mess. Oh, Eisenhearts. Another shitty one. Eisenhearts case 107 with
[32378.18s -> 32386.86s]  magic damage reduced by two. It's just, unless you get it, this is bad. What do you have on?
[32386.86s -> 32395.50s]  I mean, this is just better. Where's Tal Roshas? You don't get that till like nightmare
[32405.75s -> 32417.29s]  or hell. I think that only drops in hell. Balloons going down. I might actually get to level up one
[32417.29s -> 32425.21s]  more time before Durial. That'd be nice. LOD improves the game significantly. Yes, it does.
[32427.56s -> 32431.62s]  At this point, I think that I'm not sure I'd want to play just regular Diablo 2
[32432.18s -> 32446.92s]  without LOD. Too much better. Too many improvements. So many more items. So many
[32446.92s -> 32453.22s]  more runes. As much as the charm system is kind of dumb, it's still there and it's kind of
[32453.22s -> 32467.74s]  interesting to find stuff that works with your character. Can this be a yearly thing?
[32470.81s -> 32486.26s]  Hold on. I love this game. So I'm going to take very much to convince me to play it.
[32487.22s -> 32494.17s]  I just want to see if it was possible for me to get into the first.
[32494.89s -> 32500.65s]  As you guys know, I'm not going to play games like hardcore. I play them just kind of to do them.
[32501.38s -> 32510.92s]  Don't go down that high by yourself. What are you thinking? I'm about to make a full circle.
[32511.88s -> 32569.56s]  Here comes the full circle. Sneak around. Don't go too far. Where am I? 23. That's exactly where
[32569.56s -> 32574.12s]  I wanted to be for Durial. Right about 24, 25 is when you should be kind of going through.
[32575.40s -> 32579.40s]  I would say Act 3, you really want to... What would you guys say? It doesn't get played in
[32579.40s -> 32591.77s]  25, 30 for Act 3? Something like that. I've got to be close. This is getting ridiculous. Come on.
[32591.77s -> 32602.86s]  How big is this? This build puts us at about level 15. Well, I mean, there are points in
[32602.86s -> 32608.33s]  Bonewall. And there's a point in Teeth, a point in Bonewall. I don't even check yet.
[32610.89s -> 32618.44s]  What else is there? Points in Blood Golem? Golem Mastery? There's at least five points here that
[32618.44s -> 32621.32s]  are not being utilized well. You guys got to think about what the hell you want to do.
[32622.04s -> 32653.02s]  Those are well spent points. We can agree to disagree on them. What about a Snow Golem?
[32653.02s -> 32666.89s]  I don't think they exist, but that would be cool. An Ice Golem? Someone who lives and breathes this
[32666.89s -> 32674.38s]  game. This is painful. This is what happens when you give 5,000 people or 6,000 people earlier
[32674.94s -> 32694.65s]  power to choose a character in a World of Warcraft. Wrong franchise. We're down 4K now.
[32694.65s -> 32699.45s]  Yes, we are. It's also midnight Pacific. It's also very, very late. I'm actually surprised
[32699.45s -> 32708.82s]  this many people are still here. So thanks for sticking around. Hope you like it. I'm having fun.
[32712.58s -> 32718.87s]  All right. There's only one place. Again, look what happened. Every single place uncovered except
[32718.87s -> 32735.22s]  the one spot where it is again. And again, please don't beat the boss. I'm done. I'm done after this.
[32735.78s -> 32744.66s]  There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. Don't get stuck. EU wait. No, I'm done.
[32749.19s -> 32753.45s]  Whatever happens here, this is the end of the stream. I'm either going to die to Durial or
[32753.45s -> 32761.02s]  we're going to have beaten Act 2 and we can keep going another time probably. I really hope I don't
[32761.02s -> 32782.36s]  die though, because this would be, that would be sad. I'm not even here. What is tomorrow's
[32782.36s -> 32788.68s]  stream going to be? Well, I got to talk to Joel because I know he said that he wanted to keep
[32788.68s -> 32794.12s]  talking, but I couldn't do it today. So we're either going to do that tomorrow or the next day.
[32794.92s -> 32813.11s]  Let me stop for a second and catch my breath. Where's the one place I didn't go?
[32814.07s -> 32819.69s]  Where the hell is it? Off left?
[32822.74s -> 32831.70s]  Do I know about the dupe glitch? It's not a scam. Well, I want to do this legit. If I'm going to
[32831.70s -> 32837.38s]  beat Diablo hardcore, I want to be for real. I don't want to, I don't want to dupe like
[32837.38s -> 32865.21s]  50 million gold or something up there. It's here. It's here. I found it. It's here.
[32866.17s -> 32875.18s]  Crime I dupe glitch. It's not a scam. I promise. Just stand on the outside of the Rogan camp and
[32875.58s -> 32881.94s]  drop your best item on the ground. Oh, sorry. I'm a sorceress with telekinesis and I'm just
[32881.94s -> 32887.14s]  going to pick it up. See, if you're outside the camp, this is for security. So I don't get it.
[32887.94s -> 32896.01s]  I know all the tricks. Yeah, drop. You guys remember that too? Yeah, I do. I remember just
[32896.01s -> 32900.81s]  being in the Rogan camp with eight people that are strangers. I don't know why the fuck we did
[32900.81s -> 32906.33s]  this. We were psychos. I don't know what was wrong with us, but everybody would stand around
[32906.33s -> 32909.29s]  and you would just run to this because no one's paying attention. You don't tell anybody this.
[32910.17s -> 32915.03s]  And you just drop one of the best items of the whole game. Pick it back up quick. You just,
[32915.03s -> 32918.79s]  oh, hey, there's like 10 people there. I don't know. I'm strangers to fucking all of you.
[32918.79s -> 32922.63s]  I'm going to drop the best weapon in the entire game over here, like a hundred feet away and wait
[32922.63s -> 32928.50s]  till somebody runs over and pick it up. And sometimes somebody would get it. And at that
[32928.50s -> 32942.34s]  point you just exit in a quick game. You're not getting it back. But it always was so fucked up
[32942.98s -> 32948.74s]  when you did that right next to somebody and they just missed it. Now this game was taken
[32948.74s -> 32954.66s]  dead seriously back in the day. It's 15, 20 plus years ago, guys. If somebody were to get a
[32954.66s -> 32962.02s]  grandfather two handed great sword without even trying, and it was a great role that took hundreds
[32962.02s -> 32972.60s]  of fucking hundreds and hundreds of hours to find that just rolling dice. Now imagine if it was right
[32972.60s -> 32979.56s]  in front of you and you had an opportunity, it was this far away and you didn't get it. That shit
[32979.56s -> 32993.24s]  happened all the time. People look crazy. I'm not even over here. This is the biggest dungeon
[32993.24s -> 32998.86s]  I've ever seen in my whole life. Why is this dungeon so huge? Why is this so big? I don't
[32998.86s -> 33018.74s]  remember being this big. There it is. He missed. Is it always this big? Maybe. Okay. I needed to
[33018.74s -> 33032.57s]  make a town run. Parents of hate level two on hell says hi. Yeah. That area is such a blur to me
[33032.57s -> 33039.70s]  though because I have like the 300 magic fine sorceress and you just want one one one one one
[33039.70s -> 33044.82s]  level three one one one one static static static static Nova Nova Nova. Give me my items. Do it
[33044.82s -> 33060.79s]  again. You do it like a hundred times in a day. All right. I need to get this actually situated.
[33060.79s -> 33072.02s]  We need, uh, what is it for rejuvenation post institutions? It is three of each, right?
[33072.74s -> 33089.38s]  Oh, is this even necessary? Not. I don't, I don't, I don't need like a full stack inventory of
[33089.38s -> 33104.78s]  potions. Just mana. Put this in the stash. I'll figure it out later. Okay. Here we go. Kim subbed?
[33105.50s -> 33111.74s]  Did she really? Kim, thanks for the sub. But did somebody, oh, somebody gifted her a sub. Okay.
[33112.30s -> 33119.99s]  Hey, Spleen. Thanks for gifting him a sub. All right. So remember the plan here
[33120.95s -> 33128.39s]  is to spam potions with the inventory open and just make sure I keep my Golem and Vic alive.
[33129.03s -> 33151.90s]  That's the plan. How many town porters do I have? Plenty. Okay. I'm ready. Level up. Yeah. Yeah.
[33151.90s -> 33156.46s]  Level level level level level level. Yes. Yes. Yes. Stop. Stop. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I don't know.
[33156.46s -> 33165.22s]  All right. Hold on. Do I need this many potions? No, but I've died to Durial dozens of times on
[33165.22s -> 33192.02s]  normal running around in a circle. So yeah, I kind of, maybe I do. Big stat. Five points.
[33192.02s -> 33201.14s]  All good things must come to an end. If you can win here against Durial, you can beat Vale
[33202.02s -> 33219.50s]  without dying once to the ancients. That's going to be tricky. Vitality. And pick a skill.
[33220.38s -> 33235.14s]  The ancients are actually a joke for Skelemancer. Are they really? I'm not sure I've ever played
[33235.14s -> 33245.21s]  a summoner all the way that far. I usually just get bored and give up because you just
[33245.21s -> 33250.17s]  watch 20 people fight on the screen. I'm always like, yeah, I'm done. And then I make a paladin
[33250.17s -> 33265.72s]  or something. What is corpse explosion is under poison and bone. Yeah. I have amplified damage
[33265.72s -> 33278.25s]  already. The burning souls in act four that one shot you. Yeah. Hopefully we'll have some decent
[33278.25s -> 33288.95s]  items by then if that happens. Okay. You guys want to go poison and bone? Is it because somebody
[33288.95s -> 33293.27s]  came in and said that they had 5,000 hours in the game and now you're embarrassed that you didn't
[33293.27s -> 33310.78s]  pick the best spell in the game? Is that what's going on? Okay. No, no, no. You pick something
[33310.78s -> 33315.40s]  from here. You pick something from here. Yeah. I'm not going back to summoning. You've already
[33315.40s -> 33321.29s]  made your choice. You pick something from here. I'm not going back. Corpse explosion. Which one is
[33321.29s -> 33335.13s]  corpse explosion? Why? This is not going to do anything for Dariel. No, no, we're not going.
[33335.13s -> 33339.69s]  We're not doing the back and forth like back and forth. Are we going to go summoning? No,
[33339.69s -> 33349.56s]  just kidding. All right. Corpse explosion. It is. I know there's at least 8% of you. They're
[33349.56s -> 33364.31s]  clicking on teeth, but corpse explosion was vitality and corpse explosion. And you guys,
[33364.31s -> 33367.91s]  didn't you guys wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We've leveled up. We've leveled up. And you guys
[33367.91s -> 33370.87s]  didn't even know you could. We've leveled up. We've leveled up. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[33370.87s -> 33374.55s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[33374.55s -> 33380.25s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, we're going to revote because I didn't show you.
[33381.83s -> 33392.39s]  Iron golem is available. And so is summon resist. This gives resist all elements to all of your
[33392.39s -> 33402.71s]  summoned creatures. Or iron golem transform a weapon or item into a golem. And it has thorns.
[33402.71s -> 33416.74s]  Or you could do bone wall. You've already put one here. Can I interest you in dim vision?
[33417.30s -> 33447.45s]  Do that again. Where do you want to go? Okay. That was very quick.
[33448.41s -> 33459.48s]  Iron golem is a fancy way to save a robot. All right. We're staying in.
[33460.52s -> 33471.62s]  Durial doesn't do elemental damage. Durial does a lot of cold damage. What are we doing?
[33471.62s -> 33486.55s]  Ooh, he's going to be tight. New golem or resist? He swings for physical. He has a frost aura.
[33488.10s -> 33495.43s]  Everything's going to get one shot anyways, including me. 40% of Durial's damage is cold.
[33496.31s -> 33511.13s]  That's what I thought too. Okay. Are you ready? I'm calling it. We're doing summon resist.
[33522.42s -> 33531.35s]  It was vitality, right? Summon resist, 28% to all elements. And then it was vitality.
[33531.35s -> 33543.48s]  Well, this is the shot. Take it. What was it? It was, it was, no, it was vitality. Was it? No,
[33543.56s -> 33566.47s]  it was. It was. I remember. All right. Here we go. Blood golem on cue. Page open. No,
[33566.47s -> 33585.98s]  that's too distracting. Oh, get in. Get him. Holy shit. He's dead. Okay. Golem, get him.
[33587.02s -> 33629.08s]  Please drop the potion on the ground. Oh, that was something. I don't have a chance.
[33630.84s -> 33651.94s]  Well, hold on. Let me, let's. You think I can fight him one-on-one? I have to go one-on-one.
[33651.94s -> 33681.42s]  Is he going to one-hit kill me? He's not going to one-hit kill me, right?
[33685.77s -> 33725.45s]  All right. I don't. Is this doing anything? This is going to take forever. If I drop below
[33725.45s -> 33744.02s]  50% health, I'm running. I'm just spamming potions. Get him. Double team him.
[33769.45s -> 33781.83s]  Thaw, thaw, thaw. I'm in the corner. I'm in the corner. TP out of here. TP. This isn't
[33781.83s -> 33786.73s]  doing anything. I need skill. All right. All right. Here's the plan. I'm going to load the
[33786.73s -> 33794.52s]  fuck up on everything. I'm going to go in. I'm just going to spam him for a little bit. That's the
[33794.52s -> 33806.20s]  plan. If we actually, that's not a bad place to be because we're all going to be stuffed in the
[33806.20s -> 33821.75s]  same area. And maybe I'll take aggro. I need aggro for this to work. Hopefully he attacks me first.
[33821.75s -> 33824.79s]  I'd love any enemies on the ground. Didn't that kill? All right. Let's go back to tall of the
[33824.79s -> 33838.74s]  tomb. I just put on, should I just go get like a kite shield? Yeah. Let's go get the mercenary too.
[33838.74s -> 33861.74s]  Oh, also, by the way, I think he regenerates HP. Yes, he does. I need to just. Oh, these don't do
[33861.74s -> 33875.56s]  anything. This is a waste of time as a total waste of time. I need healing potions. Bonewall
[33876.12s -> 33894.78s]  is not going to do anything. I lose two points in Ray Skeleton though. If I just put on a shield.
[33903.96s -> 33915.27s]  I have 85 cold resist. From what? That's what thawing potion does. How long does that last?
[33915.27s -> 33918.39s]  I didn't even know if that's what that did. I thought it just instantly took cold off.
[33923.34s -> 33925.58s]  Oh, right. Okay. Well, they are worth it then.
[33928.06s -> 33950.36s]  Okay. Let's go to the waypoint and get a full army. He played Diablo 2 for 20 years and you
[33950.36s -> 33954.92s]  don't know what the items do. I've never purchased a thawing potion in my whole life ever playing this
[33954.92s -> 33961.86s]  game. There was never a reason for me to. I just didn't ever. All right. Let's get the team back
[33961.86s -> 33999.72s]  together. Aren't you guys glad you put a point in teeth? All right. We got the team back. Let's get
[33999.72s -> 34016.39s]  up. Five skeletons, three mages. Let's go get our mercenary back. And then there were 10 and I make
[34016.39s -> 34029.21s]  11. If I can get in there and tank this, hopefully we can do it. All right. You good? You good. You
[34029.21s -> 34045.62s]  got some pretty decent things. I have 12. All right. You ready? Three, two, one. Action. I'm
[34045.62s -> 34085.18s]  tanking them. I'm tanking them. Somebody pull aggro. Somebody pull aggro on me. Somebody pull
[34085.18s -> 34102.55s]  aggro. Am I going to die? All right. He's dead. We got him. We got him. We got him. Kill him.
[34109.27s -> 34121.94s]  Yeah. That wasn't that bad. That was fine. I'm scared for no reason. That was scared for no
[34121.94s -> 34126.42s]  reason. That wasn't even that bad. That was not even hard. That was not even that bad.
[34132.82s -> 34157.58s]  And seal. Hopefully this is good. Well, uh, let's one to golem mastery.
[34158.30s -> 34170.70s]  Read a bone sphere. It causes a monster to flee. Bone sphere is pretty good, but it's,
[34170.70s -> 34175.50s]  I, I, this character's, this character's all over the place. I can't even use
[34175.50s -> 34193.43s]  bone sphere. Step on the maggots. Does the one have a faster cast rate?
[34196.20s -> 34203.86s]  Also light radius. I have too much strength to have this be worth it.
[34209.80s -> 34219.83s]  Uh, there comes a loud cut scene, but this is going to be horrible if I keep doing this on
[34219.83s -> 34231.70s]  nightmare. Oh hell. I did expect you earlier. I am the archangel Tyrael. I came here to prevent
[34231.70s -> 34238.81s]  Diablo from freeing his brother Bale, but I have failed. Now terror and destruction roam free
[34238.81s -> 34242.81s]  throughout your world. Diablo's got a pretty good story. Diablo's got a good story.
[34242.81s -> 34264.47s]  Eastern capital of invincible, but their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all
[34264.47s -> 34271.02s]  costs. This is stupid. And the energies that tie me to this world are diminishing. Okay.
[34272.22s -> 34277.70s]  Sorry. You feel that way to prevent the three brothers from reuniting the sea and search for
[34277.70s -> 34283.22s]  Diablo and Bale in chorus. Time is running out. Time is running out for all of us.
[34283.86s -> 34300.66s]  All right, let's go back 13 to 24 fire damage and a stolen loss of attack rating. Better than this,
[34300.66s -> 34320.09s]  right? Hmm. Slow attack speed. Can't can do this for free. The archangel Tyrael was the one who
[34320.09s -> 34326.79s]  gave the soul stones. Yep. This is terrible news. Bale is in possession of one of them.
[34326.79s -> 34330.55s]  Let us choose your weapons and that would be an absolute disaster.
[34331.35s -> 34341.10s]  I just, that wouldn't go over very well. I was going to act three and then we can do
[34344.95s -> 34363.99s]  uh, end of the string. Let's go. Please show stats and stuff. I will. I will show you exactly what
[34363.99s -> 34371.29s]  people have decided to do. Greetings. I'm the chief captain of this ship here. Jaren tells me
[34371.29s -> 34377.22s]  I play act three real, real quick. Um, no, I'm going to kill and Ariel one more time.
[34377.22s -> 34382.84s]  Just YouTube this cut scene. It's fucking, it's pretty good. Greetings.
[34383.80s -> 34389.96s]  Welcome to Karaz traveler. If you come willingly to this ancient city anymore,
[34389.96s -> 34395.08s]  I hope you brought your wits with you for sanity is in short supply here.
[34395.08s -> 34405.10s]  The Fisto is running rampant on here. This is lore. Yeah, but it's, it's 20 year old lore.
[34405.10s -> 34420.78s]  It's 20 year old lore. So I just want to speed this up because I, it is getting late.
[34422.30s -> 34425.02s]  Okay. We'll go over a full, what happened in Diablo two.
[34435.42s -> 34455.10s]  The potion guy has a lot of money. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[34455.10s -> 34464.57s]  All right. Let's go kill on Dario. I'm going to try to do as fast I can. Why would you want to,
[34464.57s -> 34471.61s]  why would you want to watch act three? Good question. All right, let's go.
[34476.44s -> 34510.55s]  Why does it look so weird? All right, let's go quick quickly. Wait, if you play the game on
[34510.55s -> 34523.08s]  single player, does it, can you act, can, is this, do I need to see this for the rest of the,
[34525.96s -> 34546.01s]  really? I went the wrong way. Uh, usually if you reset a game, doesn't it? Uh, I thought that it
[34546.01s -> 34567.72s]  reset the dungeon too. You have to exit the entire game. Oh, so this is, I'm not, Dario's
[34567.72s -> 34576.30s]  not going to be down here. That's only on D-Net if you close the game. So is Dario not going to be
[34576.30s -> 34591.40s]  down here? He is going to be. Oh, well that makes this way easier. Holy shit. All right. Wow. I
[34591.40s -> 34595.53s]  thought that was going to take a lot longer. So you can just farm the fuck out of bosses on single
[34595.53s -> 34617.34s]  player. All right. Get in there. There's also no lag either. So even though his shadow band from
[34617.34s -> 34623.10s]  battle net for some reason, uh, actually not that concerned about it because when you play it on old
[34623.10s -> 34628.94s]  D-Net, sometimes the game would just hang for five straight seconds and that happened all the damn
[34628.94s -> 34635.67s]  time. It was this weird, like half second lag on everything you did. So actually I'm kind of glad
[34635.67s -> 34667.72s]  I am playing it on here. Change to eight players. Not a bad idea. All right, we're good. You guys
[34667.72s -> 34675.75s]  would like to see the original loot box, but no further than what I'm doing right now. This is
[34675.83s -> 34716.34s]  free. Oh shit. She just killed my friend and we're gonna get, ah, too bad. Too bad. 21.
[34717.22s -> 34738.26s]  It's a junk. Do we get one more time? Oh, okay. One more time. Do one more time. One more time.
[34738.26s -> 34743.53s]  That's it. One more time. That's, that's actually it. One more time. That's it. That'd be 30 times
[34743.53s -> 34758.95s]  done. And that's it. And I'm not doing act three. No, it's 10 fucking hours. No, I'm not.
[34759.59s -> 34782.38s]  We're going to call it. All right, let's go. I want to open another loot box. I just want to get one
[34782.38s -> 34809.90s]  more unique. You know what I mean? I swear to God, this is the last time. This is not happening.
[34812.14s -> 34818.23s]  Actually true. Not happening. Not going to happen. Just, I figured it was going to take me like at
[34818.23s -> 34824.65s]  least 20 minutes to get over here. I didn't realize I could keep doing this until we reset
[34824.65s -> 34831.59s]  difficulty. That's awesome. You said I've been Lord of the Rings. No, this is different though,
[34831.59s -> 34835.35s]  because with the Lord of the Rings stream, I wasn't planning on streaming the next day.
[34836.15s -> 34854.20s]  I'm streaming today. I'm streaming today. So I'm done after this. All right, let's go.
[34854.20s -> 34876.57s]  You've got kids to take care of. It's not too bad. We're good. Don't get fucking, I can still get
[34877.13s -> 34893.14s]  trapped and killed. He used just waking up now. This is it. We're going to get a decent
[34893.14s -> 34898.02s]  unique right here. It'll carry me all the way through act three and then we can beat normal.
[34898.02s -> 34920.47s]  Hell. Hold on. There's an extra strong here.
[34925.00s -> 34934.92s]  Soul sludge. You're going to sneeze. I just got slapped in the face while I sneeze.
[34935.74s -> 34938.78s]  No, it's like, don't sneeze. Don't do it. Somebody just fucking cracked me.
[34939.50s -> 34989.05s]  Get in there. Kill. Oh, don't, don't fucking come after me. Don't fucking come after me.
[34989.05s -> 35016.68s]  Unique. Fuck. Fuck. All right. I'm out. Save. Just leave. See you tomorrow or later today,
[35016.68s -> 35023.45s]  whatever you want to call it. That was a lot of fun. I did not think I was going to get that far.
[35023.69s -> 35027.77s]  I thought that we were going to get destroyed. I thought I was going to make it through the first
[35027.77s -> 35041.42s]  two hours of the game, but it turns out still going. That's pretty good. We'll have to continue
[35041.42s -> 35058.26s]  that. So before we play that again, I'm going to try to do a better way to have you guys interact
[35058.26s -> 35063.83s]  with that instead of having weird images pop up on the screen. Good old fashioned coward strategies.
[35063.83s -> 35068.41s]  They work every time. Have you ever tried hardcore? That's not, that's the first time
[35068.41s -> 35075.54s]  I've ever played hardcore in any of the Diablo games. Never done it, but I thought it was great.
[35076.18s -> 35091.03s]  That was fun. Was it fun to stream? Yeah. I mean, games like this are easy to stream because,
[35091.75s -> 35097.88s]  I mean, yeah, it's hardcore and I don't want to die, but the menial minute to minute is we can
[35097.88s -> 35109.56s]  just talk about whatever, just chill and just do whatever. Nice change of pace. Game was just
[35109.56s -> 35121.58s]  playing itself, but let's, let's do the bits. I'm going to go through these fairly quickly
[35122.22s -> 35127.40s]  for obvious reasons, because it's getting very, very late. I'm not going to do it super duper,
[35127.40s -> 35131.32s]  insanely fast to the point where I blow through everyone's donations, but fast enough where we go
[35131.88s -> 35140.84s]  bing, bing, bing. And then tomorrow, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[35141.48s -> 35147.83s]  I have to talk to Joel. We'll see if tomorrow's going to be keep talking or it could be the next
[35147.83s -> 35153.35s]  day after that. I will let you know before the stream starts tomorrow. You will know.
[35154.15s -> 35163.75s]  All right, let's go. We had a thousand bits from acidic vengeance. They say for your Diablo 2
[35163.75s -> 35178.89s]  unban fund. Still can't believe that. I'm crazy. And I found that out 20 minutes before the stream
[35178.89s -> 35185.75s]  started. Oh, well, got like a scratchy voice today too. I don't know what's going on.
[35186.55s -> 35193.99s]  You can drink plenty of water. Weird. Thanks for the thousand bits. Potion dweller, thanks for the
[35193.99s -> 35201.59s]  250. Congrats on duping chat into one giving you necromancer, two giving you summons instead of
[35201.59s -> 35206.95s]  worthless curses. You may actually win this without dying now. Chat, I'm very disappointed
[35206.95s -> 35220.82s]  in you for not going throw barbarian. So many classes and so many combinations would have been so
[35222.18s -> 35230.87s]  terrible for this. Yes, potion find barbarian would have been the absolute worst thing possible.
[35231.51s -> 35242.70s]  I wouldn't have any moves. I would have to default click on people. This sucked.
[35256.09s -> 35263.91s]  A B Joe gave five thousand bits earlier. We, I think we said we talked about it, but they said
[35263.91s -> 35271.19s]  here's a pad, there's a paste bin here. It's a dream. Holy shit. This is long. I got a dream for
[35271.19s -> 35280.62s]  you. Let's see. Let me, this is very long. What happened? What did you eat before this dream?
[35282.10s -> 35285.22s]  Okay, I'm going to go through this because this is actually interesting to me.
[35287.24s -> 35290.28s]  I had a very odd dream the other night. This might be kind of long, but please bear with me.
[35290.92s -> 35295.72s]  It was evening and I had come home early. You had set up some sort of obstacle course at the
[35295.72s -> 35300.12s]  beach with all sorts of odd challenges. You're at the beginning of the obstacle course, ushering
[35300.12s -> 35303.96s]  people in with a big grin. When I tried to initiate a conversation, you ignored me.
[35304.60s -> 35308.92s]  I decided to carry on. There are many obstacles in your course. One of them, you had to drive an
[35308.92s -> 35313.64s]  actual train down some cartoon tracks at speeds that would in no way allow that train to remain
[35313.64s -> 35317.56s]  on said tracks. And in another, you literally just had to bend down and grab an empty can of
[35317.56s -> 35324.52s]  Monster Ultra with sunglasses drawn on paper taped to them and hand one over to Gabe Newell,
[35325.16s -> 35330.58s]  also wearing sunglasses who was apparently running that segment. After that, you had to slide up a
[35330.58s -> 35335.70s]  water slide to the top, which was about 50 feet tall and had to jump into the ocean to get back
[35335.70s -> 35340.74s]  down because landing in water doesn't give you fall damage. There were other people there also
[35340.74s -> 35344.18s]  attempting to complete your obstacle course, although I don't remember much about them other
[35344.18s -> 35358.79s]  than the fact that they were there. I was going through a, these dreams are becoming creative
[35358.79s -> 35374.28s]  writing exercises. Sorry, stop for a second. Where are we? Where were we? I went, I was going
[35374.28s -> 35381.56s]  through, okay, a jungle section, jungle gym section that you would find at one of those old McDonald's
[35381.56s -> 35388.18s]  play places. And I saw the kid in front of me go through a clear thin plastic roof above me
[35388.26s -> 35392.58s]  that had air holes poked in it. I asked him how he did that. And he asked me if I had the right
[35392.58s -> 35397.14s]  version. I said, I didn't know. He told me that I needed the right version of the map to continue
[35397.14s -> 35401.14s]  this section of the challenges. That was the way through. I had no idea what he was talking about.
[35401.14s -> 35405.06s]  So I did the only thing that came to mind and cut through the plastic with a serrated pocket knife
[35405.06s -> 35412.58s]  I had on my person, telling the kid to be careful as he was still there, even handing it over at
[35412.58s -> 35417.22s]  some point, telling him where to cut as he couldn't see what he was cutting because we were on different
[35417.22s -> 35426.47s]  versions of the say of the game. After that, I had run into another obstacle later down the line
[35426.47s -> 35430.15s]  and the same kid showed up and asked me which power up I had chosen at the station at the beginning
[35430.15s -> 35436.55s]  of the obstacle course that you had manned. I said I didn't have one. He said you need to choose one
[35436.55s -> 35441.99s]  to complete the obstacle course. He then T posed over a pit of mud that was in our way. Not sure
[35441.99s -> 35447.03s]  what to do next. I decided that I was going to probably like going around probably wouldn't hurt
[35447.03s -> 35451.43s]  anyone but as soon as I did a bunch of germa sun surrounded me and forced me back on the path and
[35451.43s -> 35458.06s]  people behind me booed until I tried jumping over it only to fall to my death. It was at this moment
[35458.06s -> 35462.70s]  that I had awoken in my bed in a cold sweat. I keep a dream journal so I wrote this down as soon
[35462.70s -> 35466.46s]  as I could and looking back on it now I think it looks like I had a stroke or something.
[35467.10s -> 35470.62s]  Looking forward to my second go-around hopefully next time I can get past the mud pit.
[35479.82s -> 35481.74s]  Fake dream feels weird.
[35487.75s -> 35495.83s]  Dreams are so fucked up you never know. It could be completely real. That sounds pretty
[35495.83s -> 35502.73s]  that could be accurate. Keeping a dream journal is the most fun things you can do. Well you heard
[35502.73s -> 35507.29s]  the dream about the tigers in the plane and shit like that. The only reason I even remember that
[35507.29s -> 35519.91s]  happened is because I wrote it down. So yeah I didn't did this this wild shit happens. Snarbosis
[35520.71s -> 35526.82s]  thanks for the 10 community subs. 20 from Zap. We caught Zaps I remember that. We didn't see
[35526.82s -> 35539.51s]  Snarbosis. Thanks both of you. Friedl Schlitz. Thanks for the 250. Can you tell me to stop
[35539.51s -> 35545.37s]  procrastinating and go do my homework. Oh yes get out go go get out of here go. What are you
[35545.37s -> 35553.67s]  doing still here? Oh wait this is like eight hours ago. I hope you did it. I hope you did.
[35555.66s -> 35567.05s]  Futanari thanks for the 1500 bits. Yay mountain stream. Potion dweller thanks for the 250. I
[35567.05s -> 35570.97s]  apologize to chat as it's clear they wanted to keep you alive. Now that's out of the way you
[35570.97s -> 35578.23s]  owe to yourself to try Path of Exile. I've played Path of Exile before. I do not like it. The reason
[35578.23s -> 35584.87s]  I do not like it is I do not like the camera. I think the camera I don't like it's kind of close
[35584.87s -> 35591.40s]  and too high. It's one of the only pet peeves I have of the whole game. I do not like the camera
[35591.40s -> 35608.31s]  in Path of Exile. That's it. I've tried to play it two or three times now. Sad camera noises.
[35608.95s -> 35621.02s]  Remember you just said a porn term. What? I don't know. How am I supposed to know what porn terms
[35621.02s -> 35638.84s]  are? Okay whatever whatever. All right fine fine sure. All right. Havgon thanks for the 250. Hey
[35638.84s -> 35644.68s]  Mr. Albertson. Chat keeps telling me to watch the streamer called German985. The stream is bland
[35644.68s -> 35649.00s]  and his fans only like him because they have Stockholm syndrome. Watch this other streamer
[35649.00s -> 35656.54s]  called BF Bugleberry instead. He only does 11 minute streams. Now that the joke is over I think
[35656.54s -> 35672.60s]  you should watch Jojo at some point. Also watch Redline. We had a long conversation about Jojo.
[35672.60s -> 35677.24s]  Listen to my voice right now. This is kind of fucked up. Why? I know you just heard like an
[35677.24s -> 35686.34s]  explosion or like a gunshot in my room. That was a battery. Nine hours? No it was like this before
[35686.34s -> 35694.74s]  too. It was like this like six or seven hours ago. It's my throat. I can I can feel it. I don't know
[35694.74s -> 35711.80s]  why. Oh yeah we talked about Jojo already. My anime for 2020 is what was it? Ping pong. Yeah
[35711.80s -> 35720.49s]  that's what it was. Ping pong. We deliberated for a while. Incendiary thanks for the 10 community
[35720.49s -> 35732.55s]  subs. Appreciate it. 10 subs. A lot of money. People drop five and ten subs in this channel.
[35733.88s -> 35739.80s]  Dozens of times a stream. Just 10, 10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 20.
[35740.52s -> 35748.55s]  You guys are really fucking generous. Thank you. Cell juniors thanks for the 500 bits. Sending
[35748.55s -> 35754.79s]  love and support to all trans people in chat. Very good. Thanks for the 500 bits. I appreciate it.
[35759.08s -> 35772.70s]  All the love. Thanks for the 500 bits. Espada Escalada 250 doing this for the channel points.
[35773.26s -> 35784.90s]  What do you mean channel points? 250? What do you get? You get channel points for giving bits?
[35788.17s -> 35790.65s]  Is that how some of you guys have gotten to 75,000 so fast?
[35791.29s -> 35808.41s]  Holy shit. I didn't know that. Once a month. Oh okay. Oh that's cool. Phylactery gave $50 and
[35808.41s -> 35813.21s]  they said Germ of the Ridge is fucking $75. But Phylactery thank you for almost buying me a second
[35813.21s -> 35819.30s]  one. I need a second one. This time I'm gonna get the the chrome one. I like that one. I was
[35819.30s -> 35830.23s]  gonna get that one. There's another link. Where? Oh there wasn't. Oh my fucking god somebody actually
[35830.23s -> 35850.09s]  did. You guys getting this shit so fast. What a shitty fucking thing for channel points.
[35850.65s -> 35863.82s]  I'm realizing this now. What a bad thing for channel points. We will continue.
[35869.10s -> 35886.25s]  Hey but thank you Phylactery for the 5,000 bits. $50. Phylactery gives money. An insane amount of
[35886.25s -> 35898.66s]  money. Almost every single stream. Every single fucking time. Thanks Phylactery again. And always.
[35899.62s -> 35901.88s]  Appreciate it.
[35910.36s -> 35923.93s]  No. It'd be a pan-seared salmon. Pan-seared salmon with lemon and oil. Good.
[35929.24s -> 35932.71s]  How would I drink oil?
[35948.31s -> 35953.83s]  Bananas are all I eat now. All day. Every day. 365 days a year. I eat sleep and breathe bananas.
[35953.83s -> 35960.89s]  Thanks again. You've changed my life forever. You learned that eating bananas is all you have to do?
[35961.69s -> 35975.61s]  Don't eat too many. You'll get radioactive. Deadly SP. Thanks for the 1,500 bits. $15.
[35977.29s -> 35982.25s]  Jeremy it's me Alex Cora. Why the hell haven't you answered my calls? Things aren't good Jeremy. I
[35982.25s -> 35986.25s]  had to step down because of you. You said no one was going to find out. You said it was going to
[35986.25s -> 35991.37s]  work out. The commissioner thinks I'm the one who came up with this. But I'm going to tell the truth.
[35991.37s -> 35995.13s]  I'm going to tell the whole world that you, German985, were the one who came up with the
[35995.13s -> 36004.62s]  sign stealing. Even your buddy Chat can't stop me. You won't. I gotta go out of this. Half the people
[36004.62s -> 36022.02s]  in this chat don't know what you're talking about. I do. Zeroni thanks for the $10,000 bits. Jeremy
[36022.02s -> 36027.56s]  it's Andrew from Ridge Wallet. We're having trouble with the corporate account so we're disbursing your
[36027.56s -> 36031.80s]  first payment in bits. The whole team is looking forward to your next endorsement. Thanks for the
[36031.80s -> 36048.89s]  $10. It is like a nice wallet. It's clean. It's sleek. I know there's a buzzword for when you
[36048.89s -> 36053.37s]  bought something that was expensive but I really do like these and I've used stuff like this before.
[36054.09s -> 36058.49s]  I've used a wallet that was supposed to be a little tiny little steel wallet before
[36058.49s -> 36069.37s]  and I think it was a piece of shit. This thing is not a piece of shit. Clean. It's nice. High grade
[36069.37s -> 36081.37s]  steel. Hey oh wait wait wait wait wait. Those of you that have been to Las Vegas that took me up
[36081.37s -> 36088.54s]  on my go-to hash house of gogo in the link and get the blue cheese burger. I know at least six or
[36088.54s -> 36095.29s]  seven people have done that over the last year and what did they come back and say? What did they come
[36095.29s -> 36106.84s]  back and say? Oh that that was the best that was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. So I'm
[36106.84s -> 36121.30s]  not bullshitting here. This is a good wallet. You can trust me. Trust me. Blue cheese is gross. I'm
[36121.30s -> 36127.90s]  sorry. You don't have to apologize for being incorrect. You just have to be feel ashamed
[36127.90s -> 36140.68s]  in what you said was wrong. Thank you too. Oh we had another one. Mr. Mr. Goido thanks for the
[36140.68s -> 36146.04s]  $2.50. I had a dream that Jerma drank his own piss on stream haha. Oh my god why are there so many
[36146.12s -> 36162.28s]  of these today? Look how annoyed I look. Hey it's been 10 hours. We just crossed 10 hours.
[36170.46s -> 36175.69s]  Uh let's get the credits on screen. I have no idea what's gonna happen tomorrow.
[36176.25s -> 36185.56s]  Hopefully I wake up. I should. Money changed this guy. He used to be so fucking nicer. He was so
[36185.56s -> 36192.65s]  much cooler. He didn't have ridge wallets. He didn't drink Fiji water. He didn't buy original
[36192.65s -> 36200.62s]  hardware to play his Wii games on. I don't even remember the last time that I heard him sneeze.
[36201.34s -> 36208.95s]  Come on. Come on. Damn it. Oh that would have been funny. It would have been funny. It seems
[36208.95s -> 36221.96s]  it's coming on. It's okay. That would have been fun. Uh let's get the credits rolling. Like I said
[36221.96s -> 36232.86s]  before thanks for all the subs everybody. That dream is really fucked up. Old Jerma would have
[36232.86s -> 36240.14s]  sneezed. Yeah we'll see what we do tomorrow. I gotta um let me look. If me and Joel don't do
[36240.14s -> 36253.72s]  anything tomorrow and we do it the next day it's not much good shit over here. There's so much
[36253.72s -> 36260.95s]  good stuff over here. I don't even know what to choose. There's so many good games. Deadly creatures
[36260.95s -> 36275.46s]  for the Wii. We play the fucking scorpion. I don't know. We'll see. We'll figure it out.
[36279.70s -> 36289.32s]  Uh but anyway the credits are supposed to be on. What the hell am I doing? Is tomorrow gonna be
[36289.32s -> 36296.15s]  more D2? Uh we'll probably take a break from it. This was a long session here. So uh 10 hours of
[36296.15s -> 36312.70s]  Diablo 2. I don't want to have Diablo 2 exhaustion. We will probably do Diablo 2 again um at some
[36312.70s -> 36323.45s]  point this weekend probably. Why are the credits not rolling? What time's the stream gonna be
[36323.45s -> 36330.63s]  tomorrow? Well I have to eat. I'm probably not gonna get to bed till about uh I'm probably not
[36330.63s -> 36336.39s]  gonna get to bed till about three. So I don't think this is gonna be like a 1 pm or a 12 pm stream
[36336.39s -> 36349.05s]  tomorrow. So I gotta talk to Joel too. Is Joel is uh is he streaming? Streaming right now? Okay.
[36349.85s -> 36361.91s]  I wonder if he said anything on Discord. Let me just check. It's not rolling. I'm getting
[36361.91s -> 36368.15s]  set. There they are. And they're incredibly fast. Glory. All right uh let's see. Anything on Discord
[36368.15s -> 36374.78s]  from Joel? Thanks again everybody. Seriously. Another long one. But this was long because I
[36374.78s -> 36397.21s]  was kind of addicted to the game. Uh last thing that we said was. Let me see. We said uh I just
[36397.21s -> 36402.87s]  have my computer upgraded. I have a ton of issues. All right so we'll see. I'll be around the next
[36402.87s -> 36415.75s]  few days. All right yeah we'll let me just hit him a line. I'm gonna say I'm gonna be around
[36415.75s -> 36429.00s]  tomorrow the next day whatever's better for you. And then we'll go from there. Uh bits just came
[36429.00s -> 36435.75s]  in right now. Or a couple minutes ago. It was uh Flugboy. What's going on Flugboy? Thanks for the
[36435.75s -> 36443.37s]  thousand bits. Ten dollars right at the end here. They say hey Jerma gonna drop you some moderately
[36443.37s -> 36447.29s]  sized bits tonight. It's always kind of weird to me that I've been watching you for this long and
[36447.29s -> 36454.23s]  it's always wonderful to see new people. I agree. I love seeing new people. It was this huge Destiny
[36454.23s -> 36458.87s]  puzzle that came out recently and it brought literally the entire community's heads together
[36459.51s -> 36464.39s]  and it kind of reminds me of the hive mind that is chat that pulls together to just poke some fun
[36464.39s -> 36471.14s]  of you. It's really amazing. Keep up everything you do. It's always nice to talk to you. That's
[36471.14s -> 36484.95s]  part of the fun. Thanks a lot Flugboy. That's part of the fun though. The splendor of the piss Birky.
[36487.66s -> 36493.02s]  All right good night guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Whether we do uh keep talking or something else.
[36493.74s -> 36498.86s]  I'll be around tomorrow afternoon. Once uh I figure out what's going on,
[36498.86s -> 36505.03s]  this stuff will be updated accordingly and I'll see you tomorrow or later today.
[36505.75s -> 36532.81s]  Good night guys. Take care. See you soon.
