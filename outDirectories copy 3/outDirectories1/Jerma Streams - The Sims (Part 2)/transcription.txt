[4.09s -> 8.94s]  So we're gonna we're gonna be playing more of the sims one, which is fun.
[9.90s -> 13.10s]  And I'm hopefully you guys understand what I just said.
[18.50s -> 21.78s]  Oh, you pretended you were doing this, Mike. It's been beautiful the entire time you've been here.
[22.42s -> 29.26s]  I'm in one minute. Everyone needs to relax. Do a face reveal.
[33.43s -> 37.99s]  I don't, I don't. All right. Don't, just don't feed into the trolls. That's what they are. They're
[37.99s -> 46.71s]  trolls. Don't feed into the trolls. I'm not gonna play your game. I'm not gonna feed into the trolls.
[47.35s -> 59.00s]  He's naked. I am. I might be the only streamer on this whole website that streams naked
[59.64s -> 71.82s]  and won't get banned for it. Imagine they catch me on a technicality or something.
[75.32s -> 81.08s]  What are they? Hold on. I gotta protect. Let me protect myself very quickly. I'm not naked.
[82.63s -> 99.06s]  I'm just partially nude. The difference. No, I'm not in a bathtub. I promise. Juggles, juggles, juggles.
[99.06s -> 109.14s]  Yeah, I know. I'm like, you can hear that. He's in the bath. We're gonna play more of the sims one,
[109.14s -> 115.93s]  obviously. I had a lot of fun with it. Gonna actually try to make real progress today.
[117.18s -> 126.15s]  Had to burn a whole house down and leave a small child without parents. That was not my intention
[126.15s -> 131.93s]  when I started the stream yesterday. Hope everybody's doing. I forgot to say well.
[132.49s -> 138.47s]  Hope everybody's doing. I actually kind of like that. Hope you're doing. Hope everybody's doing.
[139.45s -> 150.10s]  I like that. I think I'm gonna use that. Hope you're all doing. Yeah, I like it.
[150.82s -> 164.86s]  I think it's good. Did I tweet? Why are you live? Because I'm a streamer. Once a week streamer.
[165.50s -> 178.66s]  Sorry about that. We fixed that before we get started. Why say lot words? What? Why say lot word?
[182.31s -> 192.60s]  Like what do I say? I don't know. It's either you guys or the wall, okay? If I did not have a stream
[192.60s -> 200.15s]  come on and just talk, I would likely just be pacing around and just like talking about like
[200.15s -> 207.29s]  my favorite foods and stuff. I would call my mother. I would talk to my mother. I'd be like,
[207.29s -> 212.74s]  I would talk to my mother like four or five times a week. Of course, by the way, I talked to my mother
[212.74s -> 221.08s]  once a week. When was the last time you called your mother? Do it today. When was the last time
[221.08s -> 227.22s]  you called your damn mother? She's waiting for your phone call. That's what you don't understand.
[233.16s -> 244.98s]  Say hello. Call her right now. No, I'm not gonna do that to my mother. That's like a weird prank.
[246.33s -> 254.46s]  Bring up my mom. Oh, hi, Jeremy. Oh, hey, mom. Oh, hey, you're on stream. Like, oh, thanks for the call.
[255.02s -> 261.10s]  You're using me as a prop. You're using me as a set piece for your fucking clown stream. Thank you.
[261.10s -> 269.05s]  Good to hear from you, son. I'm not using my mother as a prop for that one time when they,
[269.05s -> 272.17s]  when I had the dinner stream and that was a disaster. So I'm not doing that again.
[272.89s -> 290.33s]  All right, you guys ready? Are we all here? I hope so. Are you here? All right, so we left
[290.57s -> 303.61s]  how do we leave off? I'm excited. I like this game. Very hard, but I like it. So we left off
[305.16s -> 317.29s]  at, you're talking about, no, it wasn't. Hair reveal. All right, you guys ready? You've
[317.29s -> 323.50s]  ruined an entire family and made a child insane. No, that's not what happened. Go adopt Caramel.
[327.06s -> 336.78s]  I don't think I can do that. This is The Sims 1. You can't do that in The Sims 1.
[336.78s -> 344.76s]  Okay, here we go. What was the last thing I was doing? This house is pretty sick, actually. I
[344.76s -> 351.83s]  like this place. Friends. That's right, right, right. Friends. And I don't want to be a chef,
[351.83s -> 365.24s]  too. Let's get some, let me open up my fucking, I don't care anymore. I'm just doing it on stream.
[371.42s -> 382.90s]  And the acting career. That's right. Well, first things first. We gotta sleep. That was a bugle
[382.90s -> 389.42s]  berry. That just, that sounded like bugle berry. Where the fly is coming from? What's going on
[389.42s -> 405.62s]  here? I'm leaving. We just got here. Oh, I get it. Okay. Hurry, get out of bed. It just took me like
[405.62s -> 416.15s]  an hour to turn around and get out of the bed. Did I make that noise? It wouldn't be out of
[416.15s -> 437.80s]  the ordinary. Yuck. I do that shit. Oh, God. Get the, all right. Water. Don't forget to do this.
[437.80s -> 441.80s]  I think a lot of you guys severely underestimate just the amount of noises that I make on a daily
[441.80s -> 448.62s]  basis. I'm not even like aware of it sometimes. I just kind of, it's like I'm doing like my own
[448.62s -> 465.88s]  soundtrack. Oh, we know. All right, let's go. I kind of don't even want these. I'd rather have
[465.88s -> 471.62s]  statues. What's wrong? Oh, fun. All right. Go to watch, go turn the TV, watch TV for a little
[471.62s -> 480.12s]  while. And then we're going out on the town. I like to imagine you would do those noises at an
[480.12s -> 496.31s]  inappropriate time, like at a funeral. Um, no. Sit down and watch the TV. You doy, doy, doy at the
[496.31s -> 517.56s]  funeral. That would be so. No, that would be me giving the, um, was it the eulogy? The eucanoo.
[518.04s -> 525.59s]  Just prank me. No, that would be me giving the eulogy. And everybody at the funeral would all
[525.59s -> 530.31s]  do it at the same time to honor that person. Like it would be me. If I, okay, if I'm dead,
[530.31s -> 536.55s]  whoever's doing the eulogy, if you're hearing this right now, you need to get the entire, um,
[536.55s -> 550.65s]  funeral session to do doy, doy, doy in unison to honor me. And it has to be loud enough
[551.54s -> 557.06s]  so that at least one or two people in the, in the, I don't know, the church or wherever we are,
[557.06s -> 573.37s]  are holding their ears, going like, think about having that in a church, how much that would just
[573.37s -> 579.18s]  bounce off the walls. I think we might summon like a demon if we did that. That's probably how
[579.18s -> 586.95s]  you do it. Just like doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy doy. Stop it, stop it. You're going to summon him.
[586.95s -> 605.14s]  Don't, please. A demon. Venus music. That's right. That's going to resurrect me.
[606.58s -> 616.49s]  Well, people are doing that. I start slowly like lifting out of the coffin.
[616.49s -> 627.45s]  This that's terrifying. All right. Take a shower. Is this clean? No, no, no, no flush the toilet and clean it
[628.06s -> 633.22s]  This is so stupid. Can I like go into like a like the text editor and make this not happen anymore?
[634.36s -> 640.39s]  I understand that people can be slobs, but i've i've never flushed the toilet like that's not a personality trait
[640.63s -> 657.82s]  That's seriously not a personality trait. He's depressed. You've never flushed. No, I mean, you know what I mean? Like i've never not
[658.38s -> 666.30s]  Flushed the toilet. He doesn't flush it for personal reasons. No, he's
[666.86s -> 672.22s]  It he just has like two neatness and that apparently means you don't flush toilets
[676.38s -> 681.56s]  You're doing the doi doi thing muffled in the coffin and that's the way to make everybody there
[682.04s -> 694.63s]  Well, that's the way how people know they have to do it. They just hear like he's in there everybody. Let's do it
[698.92s -> 704.49s]  Oh, okay. How many people would run out of there? That's like a we need to run out of here and get out
[710.68s -> 718.31s]  Oh quick dinner quick dinner quick dinner. Don't sir. Don't just like have they say there. Yeah. Oh, I need a food processor, too
[718.31s -> 729.75s]  I remember that I remember that food processor. It makes the food better. Where is it? There it is
[730.23s -> 737.21s]  Where can I put this right there? Hey those bills?
[737.69s -> 743.51s]  Oh, I only have 1200 bucks. I need to go gamble some more things that you should never say
[749.27s -> 756.60s]  Okay, never mind. Will you stream your funeral? I don't know
[756.60s -> 760.57s]  We're kind of in like a weird world with that like our generation
[761.48s -> 764.60s]  It's like the first generation that would probably think to do something like that, right?
[764.92s -> 770.81s]  And when I say our generation, I mean 18 to 34 i'm not even in that i'm not even there anymore
[770.81s -> 779.50s]  But i'm just gonna pretend I am I think we're the first ones that would actually do something like that
[786.14s -> 788.70s]  He's all placed like this
[795.96s -> 798.04s]  Okay, so the uh
[798.04s -> 803.80s]  The the delivery person I have never taken these in so they've just started to play a game
[804.28s -> 809.98s]  They put it on each one of these I didn't hear them blend in and they'd like fuck it with me
[817.37s -> 819.99s]  OCD mailman
[819.99s -> 825.21s]  No, I think it's I have not taken them in ever so instead of just putting them in the same spot
[825.21s -> 827.21s]  They're just like well fucking whatever i'm gonna have some fun
[830.42s -> 833.46s]  That's why that thing popped up and said that there's no more room
[834.66s -> 836.66s]  Okay, turn the cartoons off
[838.90s -> 843.96s]  Geez is there any more?
[844.42s -> 850.52s]  No, okay, clean this up and then I need to find I need to get a chef job, right?
[850.76s -> 862.50s]  Yeah, why are we playing it seriously now? Um, I don't know because I spent like four hours
[863.32s -> 867.54s]  Destroying an entire family
[867.54s -> 872.50s]  Last yesterday when we played I spent the first like four and a half hours like just actively ruining everything
[874.94s -> 885.37s]  I want to be a superstar and i'm gonna get there. I want to be a superstar chef musician. No, thanks
[885.53s -> 903.93s]  This house is fucked though. Why is the bathroom in the kitchen? It's not it's a different room animal care
[904.09s -> 907.64s]  Oh, I want to take it but I want to be a chef
[907.88s -> 917.34s]  Why do I care about being a chef so much? Why I don't understand why I just take the animal job
[917.82s -> 930.12s]  Why do I care about being a chef it's because hold on i'm doing the animal one there's a glass door on the bathroom
[938.95s -> 950.57s]  You should learn magic medicine I thought there was only because I have three skill points in cooking that's right business
[952.06s -> 956.34s]  Took you 30 minutes to stand up and sit down again
[958.49s -> 963.06s]  Politics, no, thanks
[963.06s -> 966.74s]  In fact, I want to like send like the I want to send like a thing back to that person
[967.06s -> 975.82s]  It just says just I want to I want to click the unsubscribe on that one. Let me know
[976.54s -> 977.66s]  Oh, okay
[977.66s -> 982.04s]  It just unsubscribe actually unsubscriber is just a big lie
[983.42s -> 985.26s]  And they don't actually do it and now they have you now
[985.26s -> 990.39s]  They have the info that you've actively clicked on one of their emails, you know what I mean?
[990.63s -> 999.75s]  I'd always like freak me out
[999.75s -> 1001.75s]  They keep your info, but they take you off the mailing list
[1010.12s -> 1011.80s]  I need to go out again
[1011.80s -> 1013.88s]  I need to call somebody over and have somebody hang out with me
[1016.92s -> 1020.22s]  Info is worth more than you
[1020.22s -> 1021.26s]  You know
[1021.26s -> 1023.26s]  I don't understand that
[1024.52s -> 1027.24s]  Why is all of our why is all of our basic info like that's so?
[1028.42s -> 1029.94s]  So valuable
[1029.94s -> 1036.07s]  Is how old you are don't we have a census like why don't they just go like fucking download the census?
[1036.39s -> 1051.02s]  What are they actually doing? Why do they need to know? My name is jeremy elbertson. It's for it's for ads
[1054.23s -> 1058.31s]  You know once we started not caring about tv. They were just always gonna find a way to fucking get us
[1058.87s -> 1063.29s]  I always thought that advertisements were just gonna go away once nobody cared about tv anymore
[1064.14s -> 1075.74s]  Oh, no, why are you so obsessed with the census? When was the last time I said the word census on this stream?
[1079.93s -> 1087.62s]  A year ago, when did I say what was the last time I said I referenced the census?
[1088.74s -> 1093.53s]  Stop doing that. Hey, stop putting them in weird places. Just put them on the ground
[1103.83s -> 1109.59s]  Hire a maid. I don't have enough money to do that. I need to go get like a i'm gonna go i'm going to the casino
[1112.39s -> 1118.84s]  Oh, I remember what I was doing. I was gonna call somebody on the phone hang out and watch tv with them

[1155.67s -> 1157.67s]  Yes, it is. Yes, except take off the top
[1158.68s -> 1168.12s]  That's a lip. That's actually me right now take this off, but I don't have cartoons blaring in the background

[1235.99s -> 1240.06s]  Wait, why did I not put it down?
[1240.06s -> 1246.52s]  Imagine handing somebody a gift and they walk around through their backyard with no shoes on why wouldn't they go in the house?
[1249.22s -> 1251.72s]  I haven't said anything. Ah, it's perfect

[1530.49s -> 1552.60s]  Just get out. I got in the pool and she got out. She is avoiding me so bad. Why talk?
[1552.92s -> 1566.20s]  This is so weird. Why won't they talk? Is she just coming over to use my pool talk?

[2145.25s -> 2150.68s]  Okay, get the pea out of the yard and then because look look at the room. Look at it
[2150.68s -> 2161.63s]  It's definitely because of all this piss in random places. I guarantee it. Look at that. Did that fix it?
[2161.63s -> 2178.46s]  All right, stop eating chips and just get out there. Why is it suck still what why it's zero
[2178.78s -> 2194.44s]  What is bringing this so far town it's the newspapers. Oh my god all this fucking mail

[2207.61s -> 2212.62s]  I do like I obviously want this planet to stick around for a long time. Everybody talks about this, right?
[2212.74s -> 2221.66s]  Yep, we still allow fucking whole magazines that you never ordered that you don't want that they somehow
[2221.86s -> 2228.53s]  Just sent to you for no fucking reason millions of pieces of just paper sent to everybody
[2228.65s -> 2234.70s]  But we don't we somehow don't want to get rid what I want to stop doing that when I go to my mailbox
[2234.70s -> 2240.13s]  It's been like this since I was 15 didn't matter where I was where I lived what state what city didn't matter
[2240.17s -> 2249.32s]  There was always like thick thick magazines that the household did not order that were just fucking sent to random houses
[2249.32s -> 2254.80s]  And they were thick real magazines big big chunky newspapers
[2254.96s -> 2259.94s]  Like what the fuck are we doing this for why do we still do this?
[2259.94s -> 2267.94s]  I think that's it. I think that's a huge problem. The whole the whole mail system is so fucked up. Like why do we have?
[2267.94s -> 2269.94s]  Oh, yeah, we'll just just blow out
[2270.98s -> 2272.50s]  like
[2272.50s -> 2282.00s]  28,000 magazines to everybody in the city and they're gonna throw them away not one single person reads those hand to God
[2284.94s -> 2289.18s]  I'm sitting here telling you hand to God. I have never opened one of those ever
[2289.30s -> 2296.46s]  I just go that's a fucking lot of like waste and then I throw it in the recycling they no one opens them
[2296.72s -> 2303.35s]  No one no one opens them. Why do they do this? Stop doing this?
[2303.79s -> 2308.51s]  Sometimes I'll even go to my mailbox and it's stuffed full of bullshit that I didn't even order
[2308.51s -> 2318.30s]  It's like what the fuck is all this and this one piece of mail. That's like a bank statement. It's to the same cat here
[2318.30s -> 2323.91s]  Oh shit, they're fighting for dominance and who's the real one is
[2326.50s -> 2334.62s]  Shit boots is boots is territory. That was rant Andy. No, that's fucking stupid. I'm sorry. That's really dumb
[2334.86s -> 2342.02s]  We talk all this shit about the environment and how much we care about it
[2342.02s -> 2346.98s]  But then like those companies that these same companies will just mass mail the shit out to you
[2360.90s -> 2369.06s]  Recycling Andy. I don't want all your bullshit. I don't want all your stupid mail that I'm not gonna read
[2369.22s -> 2381.63s]  it's like if I was walking down the sidewalk and

[2410.40s -> 2412.64s]  Okay, listen, do I have to say this to you to your face?
[2413.43s -> 2418.59s]  It's really cool that you have a piano recital, I'm not going and I'm never going I will never go
[2418.75s -> 2423.08s]  Please stop stopping me on the sidewalk and asking me if I want to go to the piano recital
[2423.08s -> 2425.84s]  I will never go. Is this what you need me to do? Do you need me?
[2425.84s -> 2429.98s]  Do you need to hear me say this? Okay. All right, right my god

[2493.62s -> 2495.62s]  Don't you step in the food you idiot?
[2495.62s -> 2503.76s]  That's one of those things that you'd always think about but you never was. Oh, yeah
[2503.76s -> 2506.10s]  That's I guess that we do have people to do that
[2506.32s -> 2515.46s]  They need to transition completely and to just spam like emails and I'll tell you why because like nobody opens those either
[2515.70s -> 2527.34s]  But at least those aren't clogging up your mailbox and like burning down trees if I had to pick one of the two evils

[8377.33s -> 8386.60s]  Oh, I don't leave the grass. All right. This is this blue carpet kind of dark blue
[8391.72s -> 8393.72s]  All right, that's better much better
[8393.96s -> 8402.10s]  In fact, let's move that over in the corner and then I can put the plant in here
[8402.88s -> 8413.83s]  Oh, that's so much nicer. This gives more room to move stuff around here
[8414.39s -> 8427.28s]  Now I need some chairs
[8427.28s -> 8429.35s]  Look how much better that is
[8429.35s -> 8431.35s]  I just need some regular chairs
[8432.32s -> 8434.58s]  Two not more than two
[8434.58s -> 8448.52s]  I'm running out of money. They have to be just default shitty chairs. Okay, i'm out of money. I have a roof
[8448.52s -> 8472.05s]  Look, i'll prove it didn't have a roof. All right. I'm good. My house is now actually not a total disaster
[8472.37s -> 8478.68s]  If I can move around in this though, what's this? It's a new table. Go check it out
[8485.12s -> 8497.96s]  I don't think he likes this out here. Oh, shut up the table. What is not to like about this?
[8497.96s -> 8503.65s]  I don't understand what is not to like about this table. It's just a piece of wood
[8503.65s -> 8518.58s]  It's a place to eat move this too. Can I get into bed or is this in the way?
[8538.63s -> 8548.10s]  Um, that's all right. That's fine here. The pc looks slow
[8549.38s -> 8574.42s]  Whatever. I think I need to get rid of this. Oh perfect. Let's go on the ground ain't the outside
[8576.56s -> 8583.83s]  Oh shit, you're right. What is it? It's this uh,
[8585.16s -> 8586.84s]  this like
[8586.84s -> 8610.39s]  Strip of black on the top and bottom this one here. All right, how's that better? Get yourself a pet, please
[8610.71s -> 8614.61s]  I need to get promoted twice so I can make enough money to afford a pet
[8615.75s -> 8625.03s]  I will trust me. I'm going for it turn the lawn into a carpet. I feel like that would look really not good
[8626.31s -> 8640.95s]  Again, I think he'd hate that. This is a good setup so far. It's a good setup. I like it
[8644.88s -> 8652.44s]  Go outside and touch the grass
[8652.52s -> 8661.76s]  I go touch it go put my hands on it you wear speedos around your house
[8661.76s -> 8663.76s]  That's why you never have a face cam on
[8664.08s -> 8668.56s]  Um, I mean I wear pajama pants
[8669.04s -> 8682.50s]  I throw on pajama pants and I hang out and I just chill out in my house. That's the doom character's head
[8687.32s -> 8690.04s]  It kind of is. Yeah, that actually is the doom guy

[9767.43s -> 9772.80s]  This is just a reference of this is peter in a suit
[9773.28s -> 9777.25s]  Hey lois, remember the time when I pretended to be a raccoon and eat out of the trash

[9997.96s -> 10000.12s]  Is violence in movies and sex on tv
[10001.35s -> 10003.35s]  But where are those good old fashion values?
[10003.67s -> 10007.16s]  On which we used to rely and lucky there's a family guy

[23225.09s -> 23229.01s]  Like by the first part of the game, can you even do that? Can you make people even married in the first game?
[23241.30s -> 23245.14s]  I can't believe she went for a she went it played the music. It was like

[23300.69s -> 23302.99s]  This is lush. I can't believe I have to do that
[23303.07s -> 23337.33s]  And then i'm gonna serve dinner and i'm gonna call her here we go. She's gonna get fucking tv off. Oh pick it up you idiot
[23338.05s -> 23354.03s]  Yuck, I can't I still can't believe it like animals can pee in the corner of your lot

[23461.98s -> 23463.98s]  Okay
[23476.10s -> 23478.53s]  This is it
[23516.58s -> 23518.58s]  This game is stupid
[23518.66s -> 23522.27s]  This game is stupid
[23522.27s -> 23526.99s]  She literally tried to passionately romantically kiss me 24 hours ago
[23527.23s -> 23530.27s]  And then if I initiated it's wait, it's not gonna happen
[23532.88s -> 23539.66s]  This is stupid
[23546.93s -> 23548.93s]  This game is impossible
[23551.26s -> 23565.02s]  I actually think the sims 1 might be impossible back on the computer
[23572.88s -> 23578.00s]  Every every thread I read about this game is like holy shit. It's impossible
[23578.08s -> 23580.90s]  This game's not possible. It's impossible
[23581.76s -> 23589.07s]  This is an end this incompletable video game

[23680.94s -> 23683.25s]  Can't even do this anymore
[23683.25s -> 23684.77s]  This is stupid
[23684.77s -> 23700.61s]  You have to have at least 80 in the relationship. No, that's not even real. That's not that's not even accurate
[23700.77s -> 23717.23s]  I thought that was the one when she went to kiss me. I thought that was it. It's not it's not I have no idea. I
[23718.83s -> 23730.30s]  I'm gonna fucking melt down here in a minute here. We characters too short
[23730.30s -> 23733.42s]  They have to be at least six or ban that person for like 45 minutes at least
[23733.74s -> 23736.88s]  I want that person banned for at least 10 minutes
[23740.96s -> 23745.76s]  Okay, I guess we're gonna I'm just gonna go to i'm just gonna fucking go to um, no more swearing

[23764.50s -> 23766.19s]  Here's another thing about this game
[23766.19s -> 23776.82s]  I'm expected to have like five of these seven of these I can't even keep one person interested let alone 10
[23777.30s -> 23784.06s]  Are you kidding me and go to work every day with no breaks?
[23791.49s -> 23794.50s]  You have to make sure they're both in a good mood
[23794.50s -> 23807.84s]  I can't see the mood bar for peach you had more fun killing the whole family. I'm gonna piss the bed. Oh shit
[23808.40s -> 23837.09s]  I'm not even friends with her anymore. What the fuck i'm gonna go
[23837.09s -> 23842.56s]  I'm gonna give it one more real attempt before I take off the nostalgic glasses
[23843.04s -> 23849.76s]  And never play this shitty game ever again. You know what I mean? I'm giving it one more solid attempt
[23861.01s -> 23868.32s]  The bet was for lois. Oh, but no, that doesn't matter. All you care about is the fortnight song anyways
[23868.80s -> 23889.12s]  Does that matter? No, it doesn't matter the guitar down
[23889.78s -> 23892.14s]  What are you doing?

[23901.79s -> 23908.51s]  I'm furious at this game's mechanics. I hate them. I need to ground myself and just chill
[23908.83s -> 23918.80s]  I'm gonna go for it again. If it doesn't work then what okay, it's all good. Okay

[24002.29s -> 24015.57s]  That's so dumb that that's what I have to do. I don't even I don't want to take care of all these animals

[24037.26s -> 24047.01s]  You guys fucking with me kind of need those animals though right now
[24047.25s -> 24062.74s]  I heard there's a mod for sims 1 called sims 2 apparently makes the game much more fair and fun to play
[24062.74s -> 24064.74s]  They even added 3d graphics. Isn't that amazing?
[24073.66s -> 24076.86s]  No, don't paint I got money. Uh, what do I want to do?
[24077.18s -> 24088.11s]  I'm gonna go back to bed. I gotta wait for the animals to show up

[28687.54s -> 28695.73s]  I think I sold it. I threw it away. Uh, that's probably the longest stream i've done in a while
[28698.32s -> 28700.55s]  I feel okay. I do
[28700.55s -> 28704.00s]  I was able to get up a couple of times
[28704.00s -> 28705.28s]  and uh
[28705.28s -> 28707.28s]  doing some new
[28707.36s -> 28708.56s]  treatments
[28708.56s -> 28709.89s]  so

[28723.75s -> 28725.67s]  This has been the sims 1 probably not gonna play it again
[28725.67s -> 28731.24s]  If i'm gonna play i'm gonna play the sims 2 a much far better game far better experience from what i've been told
[28733.12s -> 28737.12s]  All jokes aside. I do. Uh, this is a classic video game. It's very very fun. Yeah, although it's
[28737.98s -> 28743.49s]  Painfully difficult. Let's do the sims 2 at some point in the future
[28746.28s -> 28749.96s]  Uh, yeah, that was a long one. I was not expecting. I mean, I was just having fun. That's the point right?
[28752.82s -> 28760.61s]  Just save it just in case and that's that i'll see you guys on saturday of the coming week
[28760.61s -> 28765.33s]  Have a great rest of your weekend. Although it is almost over for a lot of you a good week
[28765.49s -> 28777.44s]  Let's get the credits on here frozen. No
[28781.01s -> 28787.80s]  Uh, my chest and stomach hurts from just laughing at all that stuff and just freaking out
[28787.80s -> 28792.45s]  Is this a meltdown stream? I don't know does it does that qualify as a meltdown it may have some of it may have
[28793.09s -> 28794.61s]  I think a little bit was
[28794.61s -> 28805.86s]  Hey, we got what we wanted got to see the thing we wanted to see i'm happy about it. I missed uh
[28806.42s -> 28809.75s]  Ella dill gave 10 community subs during some of that nonsense
[28811.43s -> 28819.27s]  Roller crunch gave five vessel wind field gave five. Thanks a lot for those community subs
[28823.30s -> 28825.54s]  Every eight hour stream is a meltdown stream
[28830.26s -> 28839.32s]  You know, that's probably somewhat correct. You're probably right. You did not have sex with lois
[28840.82s -> 28843.54s]  Well, it was a different it was a different cartoon character. Okay
[28849.49s -> 28851.49s]  It didn't have to be with lois
[28852.23s -> 28861.64s]  It doesn't have to be with lois
[28861.72s -> 28863.80s]  Right. Uh, yeah, let's do a raid. Let's do
[28864.36s -> 28865.56s]  Two
[28865.56s -> 28874.48s]  Who's live and who's playing things right now? We raided joel a week or two ago. Let's go to
[28875.44s -> 28896.37s]  What is he doing dodge the question? What was what question? Um, hold on. Let me
[28897.09s -> 28903.80s]  Put this over here
[28903.80s -> 28905.80s]  I'm gonna i'll dump you guys on italics
[28905.80s -> 28907.80s]  He's playing disco elsium though. So
[28908.60s -> 28912.31s]  he's probably
[28912.31s -> 28915.35s]  And uh, this is by the way, this is like I think the end of the game
[28916.48s -> 28921.91s]  Like italics is at the end of disco elsium. So if you don't want to get spoiled then
[28922.55s -> 28923.51s]  Um
[28923.51s -> 28928.56s]  I would just be aware of that. You may see like the end of disco elsium
[28929.20s -> 28932.16s]  Go say hello
[28932.16s -> 28946.18s]  Keep that in mind that he's playing disco elsium. Let's say hello. So be weary of spoilers
[28946.74s -> 28954.52s]  Good night. I'll see you guys next week. Have a wonderful rest of your evening
