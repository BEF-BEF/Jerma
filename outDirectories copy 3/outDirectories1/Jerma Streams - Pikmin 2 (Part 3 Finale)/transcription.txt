[0.38s -> 12.23s]  What? Oh, right. Look, I cannot be responsible if you're going to bet on this shit.
[12.23s -> 20.17s]  Uh, hello. How are you? Good to see everybody. Where's my coaster? I have a coaster or something.
[20.17s -> 31.59s]  There we go. He is responsible. Hope you're doing well, everybody. Let me tweet this.
[32.23s -> 53.00s]  Let me get this frog out of my throat. Okay, so today we're going to complete Pikmin 2.
[53.80s -> 58.94s]  I'm going to finish it. We're going to go over a few things. Some very important things.
[58.94s -> 65.62s]  3.6 million points. Half of you guys are going to be rich and half of you are going to be broke
[66.26s -> 77.61s]  in channel points. If this keeps going on the way that it is. 22,000 points. Omega low.
[80.09s -> 90.97s]  But anyways, we've got a lot of things to talk about. Streams are going to be a little different.
[90.97s -> 95.70s]  Not anything major. Just something a little different. So for the next...
[97.38s -> 107.08s]  It's today. It is the 12th. For the next three weeks, streams are going to be shorter.
[107.72s -> 116.84s]  We're going to pull back the streams a little. Because on March 6th, it's going to be a very
[116.84s -> 126.26s]  major stream. I can confirm with 100% certainty, with absolute certainty, the archaeology stream
[126.82s -> 140.63s]  will be happening on Saturday, the 6th of March, at 1 p.m. Pacific time. That's true. Yes, the
[140.63s -> 145.53s]  archaeology stream is happening before the Catboy stream. You don't have a date for that one. I'm
[145.53s -> 149.61s]  not giving you a date for that one. You're just going to have to be watching, okay?
[150.49s -> 162.41s]  That is not a Catboy stream. I'm going to make that very clear. It's not a Catboy. No Catboy
[162.49s -> 170.84s]  Archaeologist. No, that's not happening. That's a separate stream. So there's a lot of stuff that
[170.84s -> 176.42s]  we're doing. There's a lot of work that we're doing on this. It should be a lot of fun. I hope
[176.42s -> 183.93s]  it is. But got to put time into it. So I'm still going to be streaming, but just not the same
[183.93s -> 194.02s]  amount of time. We'd rather... What were you saying? We'd rather longer streams than four hours of one
[194.02s -> 201.86s]  gimmick stream every six months. That's what you want. What about what I want? Is this your channel?
[202.42s -> 212.17s]  Do you run the show here? Do I give you the keys? You want the keys to the house?
[212.17s -> 223.67s]  I'll give them to you. You want them? Here, take them. Run it. Man, you ain't getting these
[223.67s -> 247.16s]  fucking keys. They're mine. It's going to be a lot of fun. You have several billion dollars in debt.
[247.16s -> 252.76s]  I think we own this. No, no, no, no, no, no. The collateral for that debt was not the channel.
[254.71s -> 260.01s]  It was my Funko Pop collection. That was my collateral. And when I went in and got the loan,
[262.01s -> 278.42s]  I told you. You got just $62 in collateral for your $5 billion. How's that? No, but in all honesty,
[282.39s -> 287.19s]  yeah, I'm going to do what I want to do. That's the way it is. That's the way it's always been.
[287.19s -> 295.69s]  You might be a new viewer. That's the way that this has been for almost a decade. Not sure how
[295.69s -> 304.28s]  long you've been watching, but that's how we do it. I was going to scream. Let's go as loud as I
[304.28s -> 325.56s]  could. Let's go. This guy spent almost $100 on Funkos. Oh, God. Can you imagine? He wants to be
[325.56s -> 337.64s]  a cat boy. All right, you ready to go? Are we ready to play? I'm not doing this on camera ever
[337.64s -> 347.59s]  again. I promise you that. All right, let's get it over. Whoa, I almost turned the stream off.
[347.59s -> 362.09s]  That would have been bad. It was not on, right? All right, where are we going? Where were we off
[362.09s -> 375.32s]  to? It was on. No, it wasn't. Shirtless Andy. How close am I to the end of the game? Am I almost
[375.32s -> 391.85s]  done? A few hours or something, right? I drained that pool the last time, right? I'm not putting
[391.85s -> 400.02s]  the face game on. No, I don't care. You're not getting that. There's a whole post-game area? Oh,
[400.02s -> 409.80s]  cool. All right. All right, so I want to go to that pool that we drained. I'm going on an adventure
[409.80s -> 417.24s]  with blue because somebody said that it's all blue, right? Blocking the goddamn Wiimote sensor bar
[418.54s -> 429.37s]  with a cup of coffee. You look less handsome today, Jerma. No, I look great today. You know
[429.37s -> 434.34s]  how I know? Because I got one of those apps that scans your face and tells you how hot you are.
[434.90s -> 452.44s]  I got an 8.5. I'm going to go on a grind mission today. I downloaded this app called
[453.40s -> 459.32s]  Are You Ugly or Not? It scans your face. You hold it up to your friend and it goes
[461.48s -> 468.68s]  across the forward-facing camera and then it says you're ugly confirmed. They look at the camera
[468.68s -> 476.84s]  and they're like, what? It takes a screenshot of their reaction. It's fucking hilarious. Okay,
[476.84s -> 494.04s]  where am I going? And then they go, what's this app? Is this a prank? Where am I going? All right,
[494.04s -> 501.40s]  shower room. Is that a spoiler? I need to kill stuff. I need to grind to pick up some blue guys.
[502.04s -> 519.14s]  That's a good place to grind to get blues. Anybody know? Just kill animals, right? All right,
[519.14s -> 527.67s]  pull back. Blue, put it to blue. You're going blue, right? I want blue. Not here and it's not
[527.67s -> 535.21s]  a good place to do it. Grind? They all live? Yeah, what do you mean? They're fine. What are you
[535.21s -> 547.03s]  talking about? All right, I want blue on there. How many blues should I get to go into the shower
[547.03s -> 556.58s]  room? Does it matter? No, I want the good red. A little Pikmin chant noise has been what?
[557.46s -> 571.10s]  5k Andy. Shut up. Whatever. The fact that that person voted oh, megalul after that. It's like,
[571.10s -> 581.21s]  come on, dude. It's like, look, I'm going to be really honest. I think that's funny every time.
[582.52s -> 590.54s]  I don't know why. It's like rude. That's wicked rude, isn't it? I got only five. I don't know. I
[590.54s -> 604.23s]  don't know. I think it's funny. The submerged castle in the shower room. All right, well, hold
[604.23s -> 612.71s]  on. Let me. I need to get all blue, right? That's what you guys told me. You told me that you need
[612.71s -> 629.16s]  a blue for that one. 5k Andy. That's wicked funny, dude. Oh, shit. Maybe 6k Andy. Castle is blue,
[629.16s -> 634.17s]  not shower. Okay. So the shower, I can just go with whatever I want. Well, I got some blues.
[634.17s -> 642.09s]  That's good. I need a different team then. Who the fuck is Andy? Well, look, you got like five
[642.09s -> 649.61s]  straight years of like Twitch dialogue that you have to go through. I'm not going to tell you all
[649.61s -> 662.42s]  about that. I'm going to take 25 blues. I can't wait till 50 years in the future go by. And there
[662.42s -> 666.57s]  are historians that are going to have to be like memeologists. That won't be like a weird thing to
[666.57s -> 679.29s]  say. 30 red. How many yellows do I want? Some of you guys are going to be fucking 80 years old
[679.29s -> 684.74s]  on like the history channel talking about like Kappa and like explaining what it is.
[684.74s -> 709.48s]  It's called a historian. Well, yeah, but like that's not what you'd be called. It is. It's not,
[709.48s -> 720.92s]  though. You're a memeologist. You're a meme historian. Yeah, whatever. Okay. I want to go
[720.92s -> 739.82s]  to that shower. It's over here on the right, right? Yeah. Wait, isn't there... I saw eggs.
[741.34s -> 749.99s]  Fuck it. Who cares? We'll get those later. 98. What do you mean 98? Get over here. Get over here.
[751.37s -> 760.50s]  Meme historian. Yeah. Okay. Meme historian Andy. Yep. So you'd be like Jeffrey Anderson and
[760.50s -> 766.55s]  underneath it would say meme historian Andy. All right. Nobody's going to die from this, right?
[774.15s -> 780.70s]  Okay. This is... I should be good. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What do you mean 63 out of 100 entering?
[780.70s -> 792.81s]  What are you talking about? Get over here. Why do they stop? Why do they stop? What are you guys
[792.81s -> 803.48s]  doing? Get over here. 90 out of 100. What? Guys, why are they detaching from me?
[804.20s -> 820.26s]  Come here. Oh my god, you idiot. 85. What are they doing? What do you mean 84? What are you
[820.26s -> 841.13s]  talking about? What? Why did I just lose another... What the hell is going on? What happened to the
[841.13s -> 850.90s]  other ones? I'm so confused right now. I don't understand. I had 100. Where the fuck did they
[850.90s -> 869.24s]  go? Okay. They're just buried into the corner? That was really bizarre. They're just stuck in
[869.24s -> 879.62s]  this corner, deep buried into here. Oh, fuck off game. Give me a break. Yeah, of course. There
[879.62s -> 907.35s]  you go. It was a bunch of small blue Andes. Okay. Whatever. Sorry. All right. So this is the shower
[907.35s -> 921.78s]  level. I'm looking forward to this. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa. Back up. All right. I got to...
[921.78s -> 932.57s]  All right. We need... That's fire, right? Whoa. I'm resetting. I'm resetting. I'm going to reset.
[932.57s -> 936.89s]  I'm going to reset. That was fucking bullshit. He killed almost every blue Pikmin. I'm resetting.
[936.89s -> 940.65s]  Okay. I'm resetting. We're resetting. That's a reset. I'm just going to turn the console off
[940.65s -> 950.18s]  and we'll come back. God damn it. Hold on. Just here. There's some cool... Look at this artwork.
[950.74s -> 971.67s]  Look at this artwork. God damn it. Really? The first thing I do... All right. If he didn't kill
[971.67s -> 977.75s]  almost every single blue Pikmin, I wouldn't have cared. But like that was... He wasn't... The guy
[977.75s -> 982.95s]  wasn't even on screen. He was off screen when he did that. That's fucking horseshit. No, I'm not
[982.95s -> 1000.31s]  living with that one. I don't care. It's dumb. How come my Wii pointer's not working? The hell?
[1003.91s -> 1010.22s]  The Wii pointer doesn't work anymore. What the fuck is happening? I actually cannot... The pointer's
[1010.22s -> 1017.13s]  not on the screen anymore. God, how much was this thing selling for when it came out? I hope it was
[1017.13s -> 1025.80s]  like 50 bucks. Not like 500. How much fucking was this console? What the... Hold on. Let me pick up
[1025.80s -> 1037.34s]  my brick over here with a screen on it. Let me go over... Hold on. One sec. Wii sensor bar settings.
[1037.34s -> 1048.94s]  Give me the... Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. How's the sensitivity? Why did this thing change sensitivity
[1048.94s -> 1057.69s]  randomly? This doesn't make any sense. What the fuck is happening? Oh, the ooey gooey. This doesn't...
[1057.69s -> 1069.35s]  I don't... I have no idea what's going on. Why is it doing this? My Wiimote doesn't even work anymore.
[1070.98s -> 1073.38s]  I'm not even kidding. I swear to God. The Wiimote's not even showing up on the screen.
[1074.02s -> 1085.51s]  What the... Where's the Wiimote? It thinks I'm holding the Wiimote upside down.
[1086.33s -> 1094.04s]  What the hell are you talking about? This thing better have been fucking less than 40 dollars
[1094.04s -> 1104.33s]  when it came out. This is a 40 dollar machine. At most, by the way. At most. The Wiimote upside down?
[1104.33s -> 1118.25s]  No! What the fuck is it doing this for? I'm gonna take the batteries out. There's usually... The two
[1118.25s -> 1126.63s]  dots are side by side. Why is it... So I'm tilting the controller. It's 30, 40 degrees sideways now.
[1126.63s -> 1140.87s]  I'm gonna just... There's supposed to be two dots right next to each other. I just did this before
[1140.87s -> 1145.67s]  I turned the stream on. Like, I literally just did this before the stream turned on 20 minutes ago.
[1145.67s -> 1160.34s]  Fucking 40 dollar machine. Look at some artwork. I'll be right back. Sensor bar below TV.
[1161.22s -> 1171.50s]  Repair this fucking thing. I don't understand. Why is it doing this? Because I turned the console off?
[1172.22s -> 1182.20s]  Check the TV for more information. Some explanations can be scrolled using this. No,
[1182.20s -> 1195.22s]  I don't have any info on the TV. I think this Wiimote just broke. Dude, this Wiimote just is
[1195.22s -> 1208.04s]  bricked. It's not even turning on anymore. What? Why? How? What? What? No, it's not. All right,
[1208.04s -> 1223.18s]  hold on. I've just received the batteries. What the fuck is going on? Dude, it's... This thing is broken
[1223.18s -> 1236.89s]  as hell. This shit's broken. I don't know what to do. What do I do? Let me try to read. This is
[1236.89s -> 1239.69s]  ridiculous. I have no idea what's going on. I seriously have no idea. I don't know why it's
[1239.69s -> 1245.00s]  doing this. It's not like Cheeto dust on the front of the camera or something, right?
[1245.72s -> 1265.50s]  Put in new batteries? It was at like 60%. Let me see if it works. It won't even show up on the
[1265.50s -> 1280.63s]  screen. I'm sorry. This is just bizarre. A $40 console. This is the longest fail bit ever. I wish
[1280.63s -> 1286.55s]  this was a joke. It's a... No, it's not a joke. It's a $40 at most console. Would they sell this for
[1286.55s -> 1302.22s]  fucking 500 bucks? The Wiimote's broken. It's actually broken. I can't use it. I actually
[1302.22s -> 1307.64s]  cannot even point at the screen anymore. Whatever. Me turning the console off and turning it back on
[1308.28s -> 1315.69s]  bricked the Wiimote. Let me get new batteries. Give me one second. This is stupid. I'll be right
[1315.69s -> 1483.26s]  back. Okay. So I did the tried and true method. The tried and true method is I smacked it like
[1483.26s -> 1509.42s]  three or four times and now I have two dots. I don't know why. For some reason, I thought
[1509.42s -> 1512.46s]  it was a really dark camera and you could see me. I was naked in front of this or something.
[1512.46s -> 1535.02s]  All right. Let's go. I didn't want to cancel that. Three nipples? What? Get out of here.
[1535.66s -> 1552.17s]  Those are my nipples. Okay. That's best one guy. That's best one guy moment of the week at least.
[1552.17s -> 1570.12s]  All right. Let's go. Just moving around. Oh my fucking god. This fucking console. I swear to
[1570.12s -> 1577.10s]  god. What is it doing? Leave me alone. I don't want to log back in. Go to the Miiverse? No. Go
[1577.10s -> 1592.79s]  to hell. How does that sound? I don't want to go to the fucking Miiverse. Get out of here. Okay.
[1593.75s -> 1599.53s]  So, hey everybody. Welcome to the stream. Today, we're going to be playing Pikmin 2. I'm going to
[1599.53s -> 1603.45s]  be jumping back into Pikmin 2. I'm going to finish the game tonight, get to at least a place where
[1603.45s -> 1608.50s]  I get to the end game, mess around for a little bit. Oh yeah, by the way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[3839.56s -> 3852.56s]  room I was our opportunity to kill these guys one by one okay honestly I'm in
[3852.56s -> 3857.36s]  with the Wiimote seriously like it's okay you know like this console aiming
[3857.56s -> 3864.08s]  like analog aiming like console aiming this is like a next level version of
[3864.08s -> 3868.88s]  console aiming it's because my brain knows exactly where it wants to go and
[3868.88s -> 3872.12s]  it's kind of like a mouse the code control is kind of good but it's almost
[3872.12s -> 3877.16s]  like there's like a person in my brain and in my arm like holding my hands back
[3877.16s -> 3883.86s]  and my stick again it's getting a putting a wall up in my brain it's such
[3883.86s -> 3904.80s]  like a horrible in between of like console aiming and mouse I'm pretty
[3904.96s -> 3913.40s]  fine we're not running out of purples am I I let them bait it out go ahead all
[3913.40s -> 3921.09s]  right get in I had purple selected I like like is there a way that I can make
[3921.09s -> 3924.33s]  it so it does not select another pick but I can lock this shit in it's so
[3924.33s -> 3928.13s]  annoying I don't even care if I don't have enough I know it's because they're
[3928.13s -> 3939.00s]  not behind me but I don't want to select another one and throw it get to the
[3939.00s -> 3958.42s]  don't miss the first row I feel like I'm cleaning somebody else's teeth okay
[3958.42s -> 3961.94s]  that's how I've always felt using a Wiimote with a game that requires this
[3974.38s -> 3979.10s]  I'm like a fucking dentist holding my hand up like aiming leaning forward with
[3979.10s -> 3984.22s]  a little device have to be very careful very intricate lean forward move twist
[3984.22s -> 3989.74s]  small wrist movements and I can't put it on I can't rest my arm see this is a
[3989.74s -> 3992.82s]  mouse if I could have like have it on the ground and moving around like why

[4462.29s -> 4467.53s]  may have like killed like a civilian in Red Dead Redemption and you've got even
[4467.53s -> 4474.65s]  on that even stuck on that for like a year two years you think you're such a

[4506.55s -> 4512.76s]  gonna do a personality test on stream uh we did that not that long ago we did a
[4512.76s -> 4528.88s]  whole bunch of quizzes and tests um few months ago I mean do more I want to do
[4528.88s -> 4532.98s]  more tea I love tier lists I've done so many tier lists but I think there's so
[4532.98s -> 4551.12s]  much more things to rank you know saying I love doing those it's so much fun just
[4551.32s -> 4557.57s]  white flower okay the Pikmin tier list okay sure I don't need a tier list for
[4557.57s -> 4564.12s]  that I can just tell you right now um I kind of need a look at them any good
[4564.12s -> 4579.98s]  look purple s purple s yellow a red and blue B and then white like C or D tear

[4612.92s -> 4619.52s]  Pikmin I mean if we're ranking just Pikmin characters just Pikmin monsters
[4619.52s -> 4629.24s]  or just any character in Pikmin then sure the bulbs would be up really high
[4629.24s -> 4639.21s]  hey hey get that back I don't know if this thing does but get away it's

[4919.91s -> 4927.60s]  the purples were too heavy and if you hit if you I don't know I thought if
[4927.60s -> 4929.60s]  you get hit in the face of the purple then it's just knocks you out for a
[4929.60s -> 4933.38s]  sec you have to actually land them like on top of their butt not like on their
[4933.38s -> 4942.91s]  head oh well well I'm okay I wouldn't be I don't think I could even attack that
[4942.91s -> 4945.51s]  guy from the back look at how small the hallway was he would have just woken up

[5108.71s -> 5119.80s]  minutes hey that's not a bad one to do okay let's go what are you willing to bet
[5119.80s -> 5126.12s]  on that can I not do a like jokey in quotes voice for 10 straight minutes
[5126.12s -> 5137.80s]  what do you think is it what something you want to bet on that's easy money I
[5137.80s -> 5170.81s]  don't know is it though ten full minutes let's do it put it on put it on there no
[5170.81s -> 5196.47s]  emotion for 10 minutes no it's no jokey voices for 10 minutes define a funny
[5196.47s -> 5205.05s]  voice okay a funny voice is defined as one that is very very far away from my
[5205.05s -> 5209.96s]  speaking voice one that is so detached from my normal speaking voice like this
[5209.96s -> 5215.03s]  like okay yo I was stupid although the Wiimote sucks it's not we want a piece
[5215.03s -> 5219.65s]  of shit that's like normal right I'm talking about like by the way this

[5226.85s -> 5230.25s]  technology was the best and they were wrong they were completely wrong so like
[5230.25s -> 5233.93s]  that would be a jokey voice right I guess if I was gonna do like an impression of
[5233.93s -> 5241.48s]  that no it hasn't started no no I said it hasn't started yet it starts when I
[5241.48s -> 5251.38s]  say go so it's when I say go it starts we're talking any jokey kind of voice
[5251.38s -> 5258.22s]  that's that's very detached from the way I'm speaking normally okay we're gonna
[5258.74s -> 5262.42s]  begin this after the betting starts by the way what I'm not gonna do this till
[5262.42s -> 5276.13s]  the betting is closed yeah it starts when the bet closes will he do a funny
[5276.13s -> 5291.97s]  voice in the next 10 minutes god I don't know I'm not okay it starts the second
[5291.97s -> 5305.50s]  that I say go not yet not yet I'm gonna try really those even a betting with me

[6074.52s -> 6082.03s]  this is very important so you're voting on should it count if I do a weird
[6082.03s -> 6088.13s]  scream is a scream like weird a funny voice we're gonna get this correct oh
[6088.13s -> 6109.31s]  man this is actually pretty split I'm not on a timer right now yeah and by a
[6109.79s -> 6122.15s]  weird scream is like like that's a weird oh wow weird scream like whoa did that
[6122.15s -> 6142.57s]  count as a funny voice why the fuck is it 5050 really guys did you not decide
[6142.57s -> 6149.61s]  is it this hard to do but all weird right it might not be a funny voice not
[6149.61s -> 6154.65s]  all funny voices are screams but all screams are funny sounds which all
[6154.73s -> 6159.04s]  screams are funny voices what I'm so confused you guys obviously can't figure
[6159.04s -> 6174.22s]  this out either I'm having trouble too 51 49 I gotta keep it open okay this is
[6174.22s -> 6180.64s]  getting close I'm gonna give it to you again if you haven't voted you have a
[6180.64s -> 6187.28s]  very this is important it's separated by like 15 votes funny sound does not
[6187.28s -> 6193.98s]  equal a funny voice interesting theory that's right but the shme shaping my
[6193.98s -> 6199.49s]  vocal cords to make that funny sound is me making funny sounds with my voice so
[6199.49s -> 6212.03s]  therefore it could be a funny voice I have no idea it's tricky are you guys
[6212.03s -> 6216.76s]  deciding are you getting close all right I've given you the reasons for and the
[6216.76s -> 6233.13s]  reasons for not that's noise does not equal best impression good point okay
[6233.13s -> 6241.01s]  it's he's tricking us no I'm just telling you what people would say about
[6241.01s -> 6249.01s]  it all right okay okay I'm about to close this poll there's your last chance
[6249.01s -> 6261.28s]  I'm gonna give you I'm gonna be a 10 20 seconds last chance does it count does
[6261.28s -> 6280.47s]  this is a weird funny scream a funny voice damn it it's so it's too close it
[6280.47s -> 6293.88s]  wouldn't let me vote I I can't close the poll until it's very clear what the
[6293.88s -> 6303.35s]  fuck close it I can't close it look at it look at this it's separated by like 10
[6303.35s -> 6317.90s]  people it's never gonna be clear this sucks I'm I'm trying to be democratic
[6317.90s -> 6328.40s]  about this but what the hell I should have just flipped a coin okay all right
[6328.40s -> 6343.59s]  I'm in 10 seconds I'm closing it 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 it counts it counts all
[6343.59s -> 6348.23s]  right it did counts that's when I closed it it counts a funny weird scream counts
[6348.23s -> 6352.11s]  as like making a funny voice okay at least for this particular stream let's
[6352.11s -> 6370.18s]  go do it again I should just flip the coin by the way this does not start
[6370.18s -> 6379.67s]  until the betting is over yeah to be clear okay I almost just leaned into the
[6379.67s -> 6388.30s]  mic and did Obama the you know let me let me be clear right I almost just did
[6388.30s -> 6391.30s]  that I was leaning into dinner I was leaning to do an Obama impression I
[6391.30s -> 6407.70s]  almost did that and but it wouldn't even counted it hasn't counted yet so I can
[6407.70s -> 6417.87s]  until the vote until they're all in all right let's go just don't talk all right
[6417.91s -> 6429.38s]  you need a colonoscopy bro I just had one like six months ago it's a little big

[8804.90s -> 8812.10s]  trouble I cannot laugh normal I'm sticking with this and I'm gonna try to
[8812.10s -> 8819.82s]  stay as long as I can as long as I possibly could do now they they are
[8819.82s -> 8823.55s]  going the way that they're not supposed to be going they're supposed to go a
[8823.55s -> 8827.53s]  different way I'm a little concerned that these little guys are gonna die
[8827.53s -> 8840.42s]  they're almost good it's very close it was incredibly close somebody died where
[8840.42s -> 8851.98s]  I did anybody know where the purples are where are the purples I seem to have
[8851.98s -> 8858.38s]  lost my purple guys oh they're back here I think actually getting harder to stay
[8858.38s -> 8863.55s]  in one of these voices they drowned what are you talking about they didn't
[8863.55s -> 8870.51s]  drown you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about I think they're
[8870.51s -> 8885.44s]  still alive we've got to overwhelm this guy I'm gonna try to overwhelm him as
[8885.44s -> 8892.08s]  much as I can it's very difficult to do this and still play the video game at
[8892.08s -> 8897.58s]  the same time I'll tell you it's not easy all of my concentration is
[8897.58s -> 8902.82s]  completely just front-loaded into the top of my head to only talk in a weird
[8902.94s -> 8911.76s]  way I don't I have no idea I've got my time and trouble playing the game it's
[8911.76s -> 8921.48s]  already halfway through the day so I can't get that treasure but I can do
[8921.48s -> 8930.59s]  what else is left to do so I can turn around and go the other way which I can
[8930.59s -> 8948.13s]  do that I think I think these little guys I'm gonna take him to get the egg
[8948.13s -> 8953.83s]  that's what I'm gonna do they're going to get the egg I love eggs they're my
[8953.83s -> 8965.19s]  favorite breakfast in the entire world everybody drink up we've got many many
[8965.19s -> 8976.07s]  nectar french fries excuse me do watch out stop do not go near them don't touch
[8976.07s -> 8981.77s]  them do not dare don't even think about it it's stupid don't touch them we're
[8981.77s -> 8988.03s]  gonna try to land on their heads very carefully very carefully very strongly

[9026.17s -> 9044.26s]  ready for adventure okay so I think what I have to do is I have to cross over
[9044.26s -> 9050.90s]  here for the blue guys how long is it how long has he been I have to do this
[9050.90s -> 9083.68s]  for 10 more minutes okay oh what's up with this big bug there's a big bug over

[9128.34s -> 9147.54s]  thing I've ever done well I do believe that we can very simply pull over this
[9147.54s -> 9159.94s]  guy Bart take him over here and jump on his head and then eventually we'll cross
[9159.94s -> 9171.00s]  this river I said I've wasted two full days Brian I've wasted two full days on

[9334.58s -> 9339.58s]  of the most ridiculously unfunny stuff you've ever heard in your entire life I
[9339.58s -> 9346.98s]  don't care I just I'm trying to keep my normal speaking voice from coming out at
[9347.02s -> 9352.14s]  all I don't give a shit about how funny this sounds I don't care about what I
[9352.14s -> 9357.90s]  look like on stream I don't give a shit I don't care and are you thought that I
[9357.90s -> 9373.60s]  almost slipped but what happened was I fended to a German guy Louie we

[9412.78s -> 9420.13s]  things but it's morphing into German guy again Bernie is morphing into guy that
[9420.13s -> 9426.71s]  speaks like this I'm getting close to losing I am that was not asleep that was
[9426.71s -> 9432.94s]  not a slip that was me changing to this guy that was not a slip absolutely no

[9461.78s -> 9479.20s]  quickly as fast I can I'm so sorry he's getting desperate yeah yeah this is what
[9479.20s -> 9484.16s]  desperation looks like cuz every time I try to do this and try to shave off the
[9484.16s -> 9490.68s]  debt it never works and I always look like a fucking asshole every single time
[9490.68s -> 9502.83s]  I just look like a fucking idiot it makes me look really stupid I want to go
[9502.83s -> 9523.06s]  to that place that had only blue Pikmin in there now that blue Pikmin in there
[9523.06s -> 9534.86s]  I'm heading over that way to the blue Pikmin Center but I have 86 of them now
[9534.86s -> 9555.50s]  how do I have to go up north now north north which way is north I don't know
[9555.50s -> 9559.94s]  which way north is two minutes and I can finally turn this shit off I'm gonna
[9559.94s -> 9565.14s]  turn this stupid fucking thing off and just be done with this just go up okay
[9565.14s -> 9571.99s]  should I take any purples or something with me I would take no do I need any
[9571.99s -> 9581.42s]  purples no or it only has to be okay well let's just take some blue stuff
[9581.42s -> 9594.41s]  only blue Pikmin okay so let me get to 100 blue Pikmin okay one minute and 20
[9594.41s -> 9609.06s]  seconds room temperature IQ and the E clown
[9609.34s -> 9626.66s]  now let me think and I wasn't gonna be able to do this let me be perfectly
[9626.66s -> 9639.45s]  clear I could and I did I did it well what are you talking about not a slip
[9639.45s -> 9648.94s]  this is non-slip this is rockabama that's not a slip not sound sort of like
[9648.94s -> 9692.98s]  the way that I kind of talk a little but now I know you make me go I'm gonna be
[9692.98s -> 9698.04s]  in debt forever um let me explain what happened I started to do Barack Obama
[9698.04s -> 9703.63s]  started doing Barack Obama everyone said slipped slip slip slip slip slip slip
[9703.63s -> 9706.67s]  slip and then I struck and then I started to make Barack Obama's voice
[9706.67s -> 9710.51s]  sounds fucking horrible so I didn't want to make it sound like I was doing a
[9710.51s -> 9713.59s]  really shitty Barack Obama so I was correct I was telling you guys that oh
[9713.59s -> 9727.89s]  look at how bad my Barack Obama sounds now no slip what do you mean I won I did
[9727.89s -> 9747.31s]  it did I actually do it watch the clip and pull it all right let's watch the
[9747.31s -> 9768.80s]  clip I'm slipping I think a lot of you guys just fucking feel bad let me hear
[9768.80s -> 9774.09s]  it let's say I'm gonna I want to hear it where is it
[9774.09s -> 9793.66s]  we said Obama slips let's see no and I did let me be perfectly clear I could
[9793.66s -> 9805.01s]  and I did I did it well what are you talking about not a slip this is
[9805.01s -> 9814.43s]  not slip this is Barack Obama that's not slip my sound sort of lack the way that I
[9814.43s -> 9820.72s]  kind of talk a little but now I know you make me go I was Bernie Sanders into
[9820.72s -> 9828.66s]  Mario getting his ass lit on fire I kind of talk a little but now I know now
[9828.66s -> 9835.21s]  night and not now I yeah that was Bernie Sanders then turning into Mario getting
[9835.21s -> 9839.37s]  his ass lit on fire go I know you make me go I but now I know you make me go
[9840.37s -> 9845.37s]  now you make now you make me go on now you make me go on that's not a slip
[9845.37s -> 9858.74s]  that's Bernie Sanders I think we're good but now I know you make me go so in
[9858.74s -> 9877.70s]  question is was that a slip fucking stupid thing I've ever done let me give
[9877.70s -> 9880.90s]  you let me give it to you again so you understand what you know what you're
[9880.90s -> 9894.09s]  doing here but now I know you make me go on the slip was that Bernie Sanders
[9894.09s -> 9910.52s]  just just seamlessly going into a loud funny like Ren and Stimpy scream it was
[9910.52s -> 9920.67s]  seamless it was seamless Bernie Sanders now you make me go loud equals funny
[9920.67s -> 9940.35s]  exactly absolutely you're right absolutely loud equals funny 1 billion
[9940.35s -> 9955.15s]  1.5 billion compromise I'm sick yeah we got a vote this is a no-slip by the way
[9955.15s -> 9961.38s]  alright that's a 1.5 billion compromise I'll take 500 we'll take 500 million off
[9961.38s -> 9968.48s]  the debt for me maybe maybe an awkward transition between Bernie going into
[9968.48s -> 9977.06s]  Mario lighting his ass on fire alright deal deal deal alright let's go I'm
[9977.06s -> 9987.94s]  gonna play the game now I'm getting a fucking face cam it was so painful that
[9987.94s -> 10002.51s]  sucked that was the worst that's oh yeah is it worth like the potentially okay
[10002.51s -> 10008.67s]  yeah I get that compromise is it worth you'd shave 500 million off that one

[13408.79s -> 13415.18s]  Pokemon Pokemon school it's an interesting concept I think the show was
[13415.18s -> 13417.90s]  interesting I like I thought it was interesting that was cool it was a cool
[13417.90s -> 13423.70s]  show it was worth watching I would say I want to make sure I go back to that
[13423.70s -> 13426.66s]  because people were pretty probably upset about that I don't mean that I
[13427.30s -> 13438.51s]  do that sometimes that's what we do they make up fake scenarios oh yeah oh yeah my
[13438.51s -> 13444.63s]  allowance doubled and it's all thanks to my papa after all he's a great captain

[13472.04s -> 13483.19s]  two hundred bucks it's worth it so he's gonna go dig it I need some
[13483.19s -> 13486.23s]  white I only have six white Pikmin that's horrible
[13486.23s -> 13496.76s]  Pikmin's cooler than Jerma I mean there's some facets of Pikmin that are
[13496.76s -> 13501.53s]  cooler than me I still think I had my coolness factor is a little bit higher
[13501.53s -> 13525.69s]  than Pikmin by just a small amount I think so I'm more red coolness factor
[13525.69s -> 13534.83s]  all right not wasting time let's just get over there and do it don't lose
[13534.83s -> 13546.23s]  anybody come on don't walk into the wall either somebody did I'm here at CVS

[15784.50s -> 15790.34s]  for like 14 hours if I didn't know what Hoka Tate industries was I feel like I
[15790.34s -> 15794.30s]  wouldn't be paying attention to anything in the game I mean anything
[15794.30s -> 15819.49s]  drink up all right good good good good good good good good I'm ready I want to

[15889.59s -> 15898.37s]  on hello yeah I couldn't even see that like blending into the ground they
[15898.41s -> 15904.21s]  should just make the ground concrete in this game like it's so ugly just kidding
[15904.21s -> 15939.10s]  I'm sorry oops all I'm saying is it should have been a cartoon like what
[15939.10s -> 15945.08s]  would it come on this is a perfect cartoon Hickman 1, Hickman 2, Hickman 3
[15945.08s -> 15953.29s]  where's the like animated series that'd be so awesome is art isn't it oh they're
[15953.29s -> 15972.38s]  animated shorts are they really come here guys there is that's cool I would
[15972.38s -> 15980.96s]  love a little cartoon Hickman the animated series would be awesome come on
[15980.96s -> 16006.25s]  hurry up why get in there and do something watch the shorts on YouTube I
[16006.25s -> 16013.55s]  don't know if I can I'm kind of scared to do that am I is it really gotten to
[16013.55s -> 16016.07s]  the point where I'm afraid to like watch a YouTube video of like a show or
[16016.07s -> 16043.50s]  something it is technically Nintendo video right Nintendo doesn't fuck around
[16043.50s -> 16055.37s]  anymore no entertainment is illegal didn't you know that yeah well I know
[16055.37s -> 16059.35s]  people saying what about Bionicle yeah Bionicle is free to watch on YouTube
[16059.35s -> 16065.02s]  that does not mean it is free for me to distribute on my stream there's a thought
[16065.06s -> 16078.99s]  of legality there oh my god I need that pinecone I do not have the broadcasting
[16078.99s -> 16083.25s]  rights to the Bionicle movie it's how this works just because something is
[16083.25s -> 16088.22s]  free does not mean that I can just do whatever I want with it just hold up a
[16088.22s -> 16091.22s]  controller and pretend it's a video game didn't somebody do that at one point for
[16091.22s -> 16102.43s]  like a Super Bowl kill kill kill kill kill kill kill hurry hurry up please
[16102.43s -> 16110.34s]  we're good it was UFC that's so stupid that's
[16110.38s -> 16121.66s]  unbelievable but now I I cannot just stream the Bionicle movie I do not have
[16121.66s -> 16126.70s]  the rights to I don't have the broadcasting rights to Bionicle which I
[16126.70s -> 16136.63s]  need to be able to show that on stream and is it correct me if I'm wrong here
[16136.63s -> 16144.69s]  but Bionicle is Disney is it not I don't think that's gonna happen isn't that
[16144.69s -> 16171.54s]  underneath the Disney umbrella it's a Lego hold on Bionicle Bionicle who owns
[16171.54s -> 16181.44s]  Bionicle Lego would never be able to watch it it's Lego wait Lego is
[16181.44s -> 16190.26s]  Bionicle but isn't who owns Lego is Lego just Lego and somebody own Lego is a
[16190.26s -> 16196.58s]  Warner Lego just is Lego but who has like who has like the rights to like the
[16196.58s -> 16216.19s]  Lego movies and stuff and Lego media TV shows and stuff John Lego I thought it
[16216.19s -> 16220.22s]  was Disney I thought Disney had like the broadcasting rights to like Bionicle or
[16220.22s -> 16222.66s]  something I don't know why I thought that I know where I got that from what I
[16222.66s -> 16235.43s]  get that from they do okay so I was right this present be extremely careful
[16235.43s -> 16246.18s]  all the more your job is to protect his life at all costs
[16246.18s -> 16254.62s]  hello it's me mr. Bionicle Jerva go right ahead thank you mr. Bionicle I
[16254.62s -> 16264.35s]  really appreciate that okay I got treasures over here but where is it oh
[16264.35s -> 16289.50s]  fuck run away holy shit there's too many things over here yeah the Lego group is
[16289.50s -> 16293.14s]  owned by a certain company but the dish the distribution rights to the Bionicle
[16293.14s -> 16308.25s]  movies I don't think is Lego so I'm trying to say run run run run run run I
[16308.25s -> 16317.72s]  think I'm just dead here it is Disney people saying no it is I think it is
[16317.72s -> 16324.06s]  though I actually do think it is it's distributed by Buena Vista which is
[16324.06s -> 16350.17s]  Disney right yeah I had it right there's so many enemies here it's just just a
[16350.17s -> 16366.85s]  mess this is a mess right now didn't I drain this water already I thought I
[16366.85s -> 16389.08s]  already drained this oh whatever this place is cool but not really I mean
[16389.08s -> 16397.13s]  Disney does not have rights okay regardless if it's Disney or Warner or
[16397.13s -> 16403.49s]  Buena Vista or paramount whatever it doesn't matter it's not me I don't own
[16403.49s -> 16421.75s]  the right can't stream it buy out Windows Vista no Buena Vista okay I'll
[16421.75s -> 16432.50s]  add I'll see you guys tomorrow buy them you millionaire listen even if I let's
[16432.50s -> 16435.46s]  just say I had let's just say I was right let's just say it was a millionaire
[16435.50s -> 16438.62s]  you know how much it's gonna cost to buy Bionicle probably like more that yeah
[16438.62s -> 16448.48s]  gotta probably add a zero or two it's probably quite a few zeros to buy
[16448.48s -> 16456.69s]  Bionicle to stream it the one movie I guarantee it's least it's at least 10
[16456.69s -> 16473.46s]  million to buy the rights to Bionicle and that would be a steal I got some
[16473.46s -> 16481.56s]  treasure though ask them nicely you know I did who knows I we that we I've
[16481.56s -> 16488.63s]  reached out yeah I got a guy working on it we'll see probably not though don't
[16488.63s -> 16498.15s]  get your hopes up okay if I do if I ended up ever getting the rights to
[16498.15s -> 16501.75s]  actually broadcast that on stream you do understand that to be able to do that I
[16501.75s -> 16505.19s]  probably have to sign an agreement that means I cannot I probably can't like say
[16505.19s -> 16510.60s]  like dog shit on stream anymore that would have to be a very I think family
[16510.60s -> 16513.96s]  friendly stream if I was given the rights by whatever group owns it to
[16513.96s -> 16523.40s]  distribute it on when watch it on stream okay we're back and I'm back to this
[16523.40s -> 16538.53s]  bridge will stay but wait sorry whatever I'll see you guys tomorrow I got a new
[16538.53s -> 16551.36s]  cave but now yeah that's it that's it we'll see you tomorrow signed off it's
[16551.36s -> 16557.26s]  still playing no no no no I got my fun out of it I have my fun in Pikmin so the
[16557.26s -> 16560.78s]  amount of times that I said I hate this controller versus this was a really fun
[16560.78s -> 16568.78s]  game that was a cool thing I just saw what's the ratio there four to one five
[16568.78s -> 16577.06s]  to one it's at least like five to one right I give Pikmin to a 76 and then in
[16577.06s -> 16592.96s]  brackets plus five with GameCube controller does that sound pretty good
[16592.96s -> 16605.70s]  score it is I enjoyed it very much so all right I'll see you guys tomorrow
[16605.70s -> 16608.54s]  we're gonna do slime rancher tomorrow which is just another Pikmin there's
[16608.54s -> 16615.30s]  just another cute little blue red yellow purple orange monsters that you throw
[16615.30s -> 16625.36s]  around is it a completely different game we'll see you tomorrow have a great rest
[16625.36s -> 16635.30s]  of your night let's do the credits what time 2 p.m. Pacific time 2 p.m. Pacific
[16635.30s -> 16640.21s]  same time we started today if you're gonna be around maybe we'll see you if
[16640.21s -> 16645.46s]  not then have a great night thanks for watching as always this has been Pikmin
[16645.46s -> 16652.42s]  2 I now have access to a Wii U so if there's something that is worth playing
[16652.42s -> 16657.14s]  on the Wii U and I do have it and I don't think I've ever really streamed
[16657.14s -> 16663.46s]  anything on the Wii U I did a bunch of Wii stuff but I don't think I've ever
[16663.46s -> 16673.34s]  really done a Wii U game do Pikmin 3 I don't know it's a literally only Pikmin
[16673.34s -> 16683.17s]  3 is the only one we'll see I'll give it a look all right here come the subs
[16683.17s -> 16692.82s]  thanks everybody it's insane how many people have subbed to this channel still
[16692.82s -> 16697.18s]  I don't I sometimes I just I just wonder why stare at the ceiling and I'm like
[16697.18s -> 16699.66s]  how can this many people want to give me five dollars a month I don't understand
[16699.82s -> 16708.03s]  but thanks I really appreciate it nonetheless it's a Plants vs. Zombies HD
[16708.03s -> 16721.46s]  they really kind of ruined that franchise didn't they that's weird that
[16721.46s -> 16726.79s]  went completely 180 real quickly didn't it I went from one of them was most
[16726.79s -> 16734.55s]  beloved everyone at PAX has the funny mask on and the cone on their head to
[16734.55s -> 16740.78s]  this is the most disgusting awful shitty game shitty practice ever by a company
[16740.78s -> 16746.64s]  ever and no one cares about pick I was at portal to Pikmin 2 what plans for
[16746.64s -> 16755.08s]  zombies 2 if you want to see a total 180 of community engagement versus
[16755.08s -> 16760.21s]  hatred of an entire franchise look no further than plants for a zombie 2 I
[16760.21s -> 16768.58s]  remember playing plants for zombies 2 and I was my base melted off
[16768.58s -> 16771.70s]  essentially with how I could not understand and I was just flabbergasted
[16771.70s -> 16777.67s]  what you needed to pay fucking money to like do well in that game that's all I
[16777.67s -> 16784.60s]  remembered I remember it was I got like 20 30 levels in or something oh this is
[16784.60s -> 16788.36s]  kind of fun but then it was like you like you're getting overwhelmed unless
[16788.36s -> 16793.28s]  you like use the super electrocution devices and stuff so what ended up
[16793.28s -> 16796.88s]  happening is I just ended up having a bunch of the electrocution like super
[16796.88s -> 16799.72s]  killed all that just wiped the screen things and I didn't play the game
[16799.72s -> 16804.77s]  anymore I just opened a level waited for enough stuff was to be loaded onto the
[16804.77s -> 16810.24s]  screen and then kill everything with the electricity I didn't even play the game
[16810.24s -> 16815.64s]  it was horrendous that was one of the worst games I've ever played and I'd
[16815.64s -> 16818.04s]  really mean that that was like one of the most that was one of the stupidest
[16818.04s -> 16825.99s]  things I've ever played I've ever played it's insane how bad they fucked up that
[16825.99s -> 16829.47s]  first game is unironically fantastic oh yeah well a lot of the pop cap stuff
[16829.47s -> 16837.72s]  was unironically fantastic it was just egregious horrendous business practices
[16837.72s -> 16844.12s]  and notice how you did they even talk about plans for zombies they have that
[16844.12s -> 16849.40s]  garden warfare game but I'll be honest I don't I don't care at all about that I
[16849.40s -> 16853.40s]  doesn't I wanted like a plans for zombies 2 or plans for zombies 3 or
[16853.40s -> 16857.92s]  something I've actually heard that it's not bad I've heard that garden warfare
[16857.92s -> 16864.47s]  is actually pretty fun that's to me to me that's the that's the side series
[16864.47s -> 16868.43s]  right that's the that's not the main series they've got plans for zombies
[16868.43s -> 16871.79s]  plans for zombies 2 plans for somebody's garden warfare cool it's a really kind
[16871.79s -> 16875.19s]  of fun an FPS game go check it out maybe but I want it I want like a main
[16875.19s -> 16882.86s]  plants for zombies game that's not just I on the app store dude move on no I'm
[16882.86s -> 16885.62s]  not gonna move on this is incredibly important topic to me I'm not gonna move

[16900.84s -> 16907.81s]  got heard something in my ear I heard and I thought that somebody did
[16907.81s -> 16914.16s]  something all right I'll see you later have a great rest of your night see
