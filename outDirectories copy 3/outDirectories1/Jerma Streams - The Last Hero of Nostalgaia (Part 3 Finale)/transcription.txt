[20.79s -> 33.98s]  How's it going? Yeah, I was gonna do it tomorrow. It's gonna be live tomorrow, but eh. It was on the
[33.98s -> 40.14s]  brain. Just figured I'd finish it tonight. Probably not going to be a very long stream, but I'm into
[40.14s -> 45.66s]  this. I want to play it and I want to finish it. Reverse delay. Sometimes it happens. Well, it's
[45.66s -> 55.05s]  actually been happening a lot more frequently. Yeah, it's supposed to be tomorrow, but yeah,
[55.05s -> 65.78s]  whatever. Let's go. I imagine there's probably only another hour or two left in the game, so why not?
[66.42s -> 73.35s]  You got a Tom Hanks voice today? What? No, I don't. I do not. And whatever. I don't care.
[113.99s -> 123.59s]  Well, I feel like I've lectured pre-stream chat about a bunch of random subjects.
[124.15s -> 141.74s]  I feel like I get in there sometimes and I just kind of write. I honestly, sometimes, I know. Okay,
[141.74s -> 145.98s]  here we go. Here comes the beast. Gonna break the magic. Sometimes when I'm in pre-stream chat,
[145.98s -> 150.94s]  I feel like I have the bugleberry mask on. You know what I mean? Like I just kind of, I can,
[150.94s -> 156.57s]  it's just, I can just say anything. I don't know. Something about it. It's only like in pre-stream,
[156.57s -> 159.93s]  but I just, oh, the grilled cheese hit the floor kind of stuff. Like I don't even like,
[160.49s -> 171.35s]  it's just whatever. Mask, mask, mask. I mean, sometimes I put the bugleberry mask on
[171.99s -> 183.30s]  because, well, I, you know, I've, whatever. Santa isn't real. Okay. Sorry. It's been your
[183.30s -> 206.68s]  parents the whole time. Bro, what the fuck? Bugleberry is my parents? Take that back.
[207.40s -> 216.71s]  How can, how could I possibly say Santa isn't real when Santa was on my stream a couple months
[216.71s -> 237.54s]  ago? You guys can't be serious. Who was that then? Yeah. All right. Let's, let's get started.
[239.99s -> 252.12s]  500,000 bugs watching today. That's a lot. That's a huge viewership. Damn. Why are you like this?
[252.84s -> 258.44s]  I don't know. Cause I like having fun. It's really all I care about. Like the only thing I care about.
[259.08s -> 271.69s]  Sometimes I make my own fun. You know what I mean? You ever played brutal legends? No, but it looks
[271.69s -> 289.46s]  fun. I always saw, I saw it kind of always on the shelf. Like, oh cool. I never really played it.
[290.18s -> 297.24s]  Seemed like a cool concept. Yeah. Let's, let's finish this. Like, I don't know. I'm not, there's
[297.24s -> 302.20s]  no time limit on this stream, but there's no time frame. It's just, I'm going to go until I beat it
[302.20s -> 316.81s]  and then we'll see. Finish Hollow Knight. Yeah, probably. Are you going to stream more than three
[316.81s -> 326.78s]  times this week? Um, well, technically this is the end of a week. It is currently Saturday evening.
[328.07s -> 338.55s]  So I, the answer to that question I believe is no. So not this week. Sunday is the only,
[338.55s -> 343.08s]  I'm not streaming tomorrow. Instead of streaming this tomorrow, I'm streaming this today.
[343.72s -> 353.14s]  Just do four streams in a row. I mean, maybe I will at some point. It's in the middle of the
[353.14s -> 363.11s]  night on Sunday. Well, yeah, it could be anywhere for anybody. How am I supposed to do any work
[363.11s -> 373.75s]  if you keep streaming you shithead? I don't know. Maybe just, maybe do the things you need to do.
[379.75s -> 385.56s]  Hey, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to be here. Go do the things you need to do and then come
[385.56s -> 403.27s]  back when you're ready. Hey, that's not on me. It's not on me. All right, let's go. And the
[403.27s -> 409.43s]  good thing about this time rather than last night is I know exactly where I am because we beat a
[409.43s -> 419.58s]  boss and I immediately stopped the stream. You don't get it. It's not that simple. You know,
[422.14s -> 435.16s]  you kids, you kids don't understand. Back a long time ago, if there was a television show on TV
[436.04s -> 442.23s]  and you missed it, you didn't get to go back. You had to catch it when it was on or wait till
[442.23s -> 452.65s]  they released the fucking DVD like seven months later. You don't understand how easy you have it.
[452.65s -> 464.02s]  All content is available. You have no idea. It's called a VCR. You could tape it, but what if you
[464.02s -> 473.00s]  don't have a tape? What if you have like a box full of tapes and what if you ran out? What if
[473.00s -> 477.42s]  you're just like, I don't like, what if you don't feel like putting a tape in and hitting record?
[478.34s -> 482.10s]  What if you missed it? What if you, I know like, oh, what? I'm just going to record
[482.90s -> 487.85s]  because I know it's going to be on at the tape could only record 60 to 90 minutes.
[487.85s -> 498.06s]  You couldn't go to work and record something. The tape was only like 60 minutes. Nice villain
[498.06s -> 512.65s]  monologue. You have no idea. The point of this initial monologue tell you, you can just watch
[512.65s -> 520.95s]  the VOD. Although it's not ideal because you can't say, okay, yes. When I do something,
[520.95s -> 545.74s]  I get it. I do. Uh, TLDR time that person out for five seconds. Let's go. All right. This is like
[545.74s -> 550.14s]  fucked. It is like a fucked up comment, but I have to read it because it's actually, it's just,
[550.14s -> 555.27s]  I have to read it. They say, what do they say? It was, where is it? I want to get it right.
[557.21s -> 567.74s]  No, I need to be in sync with your breathing. All right, you know, time that person out for five
[567.74s -> 592.15s]  seconds too. That is a weird comment. All right. How come my controller doesn't work? Um, hello.
[592.15s -> 600.57s]  How come I can't? There we go. All right. So the last thing we did. Yep. I beat that boss.
[600.57s -> 616.10s]  We got to the new area and I am precisely where I want to be lined up lined up perfectly with where
[616.10s -> 633.59s]  I want to go. Nice armor. Thanks. Oh my God. Okay. I didn't wait. Start over. There we go.
[633.59s -> 646.54s]  The audio was low for me. I, yeah, this, this, this is bloodborne. This is supposed to be bloodborne.
[646.54s -> 657.14s]  This is great. Where's the beetle cam? Uh, I don't have the Beatles yet. Notice how I said yet.
[657.14s -> 674.55s]  That decision has been locked in. Yeah. So for those that don't know, I, all right, I got, I,
[674.55s -> 678.31s]  it's so funny how your opinions and your life kind of changes and the way you see the world
[678.31s -> 684.47s]  changes as you get a little older. I never thought I was going to care about bugs. Bugs, oh bugs,
[684.47s -> 691.38s]  who care? Like when I was younger, no, not even close. They kind of like fascinate me now. It's
[691.38s -> 695.06s]  interesting. It's weird how it was like, oh yeah, I didn't care at all until like literally
[695.06s -> 719.06s]  this last year, Jesus die. Okay. But anyways, the, I, I've talked about it a couple of weeks
[719.06s -> 726.23s]  ago or so, whatever it was, but, uh, blue death feigning Beatles, they just look, they're so cool
[726.23s -> 735.29s]  looking and they're just so, it's just like silly. They're just silly little friends and they can
[735.29s -> 739.67s]  live a very, very, very long time. They don't take a whole lot of maintenance and it seemed
[739.67s -> 755.50s]  like kind of cool. Just like a thing to do. There's a, it's a fascinating world and sometimes I kind
[755.50s -> 769.16s]  of want to, I'd like to experience it, right? That's pretty much all there is to it. The Dead
[769.16s -> 783.53s]  Space remake is Jesus Christ. Hold on. I'm dead. I'm dead. All right. These things are no joke.
[783.53s -> 807.72s]  Jesus Christ is in Dead Space. Do you know what I keep laughing at? I, I need some opinions.
[807.72s -> 817.88s]  I need some chat opinions. So, uh, Wild Hearts last night. Um, the pig talking clip is just living
[817.88s -> 827.21s]  in my head rent free. I just keep thinking about it. Something, I don't know why I thought it was
[827.21s -> 835.70s]  so funny, but, um, so part of that sponsor is, um, I'm going to be tweeting out a clip from the stream
[835.70s -> 841.50s]  and they were just like, yeah, pick any, like any, like fun clip, doesn't matter. Like whatever it is,
[841.50s -> 848.12s]  as long as it's like fun or interesting. And I kind of want to use that. I think that that's,
[848.20s -> 861.43s]  I think that's fucking hilarious. Do you think that would, do you think that goes hard? I think
[861.43s -> 877.35s]  it does. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause I was thinking about it. I was like, maybe it should be that
[877.35s -> 884.20s]  cause I don't know. Whatever. Oh my, okay. This is, these are the hardest enemies in the game.
[884.20s -> 895.48s]  I can't, I gotta, Jesus, I'm dead again. I lost 10,000 souls. Yeah. Or that, that falling. Yeah.
[895.48s -> 900.84s]  So there's the other one when I have the hammer and I'm going down the zip line and I perfectly
[900.84s -> 905.96s]  time it. So I'm about to land just one, two, three, four, five, spinning with the hammer.
[905.96s -> 914.09s]  And I just land and die. And then Vinny dies right next to me. You can see, maybe people didn't pick
[914.09s -> 920.52s]  up on that. Or if you did, then you did. But Vinny literally at the end of that part falls right next
[920.52s -> 934.95s]  to me in the same spot and dies. Holy shit. Hold on. Oh my God. Uh, run a poll. I mean, there also
[934.95s -> 939.59s]  was a kind of a cool gameplay moment where I did the bulwark boom timed it perfectly and then did
[939.59s -> 949.54s]  a huge jumping slash. All right, let's get a poll. I'm curious. Uh, cool bulwark into jumping slash,
[949.54s -> 957.78s]  the pig talks or falling with the hammer. I mean, there's no way the gameplay one's going to win,
[957.78s -> 962.58s]  which, but I mean, we have to put it there. The pig is going to be 80%.
[963.46s -> 981.85s]  I don't know. The other one was, was pretty good too. You know what it is? These guys don't get
[981.85s -> 993.61s]  staggered when you hit them. Oh, these are unbearable. Could you do all three? Um,
[994.09s -> 1018.71s]  pro probably. Can you show the clips? Um, I think it's, I think it's pretty much not even close.
[1018.71s -> 1029.56s]  I don't think we need to do that. Judging by what this looks like so far. Looks like, uh, yeah,
[1029.56s -> 1065.42s]  appreciate it. 83% damn pig sweep. All right. Don't lose here. Cause one comes from one runs behind
[1065.42s -> 1079.51s]  you. Oh jeez. Oh my goodness. Please do not. No, no, no, no. Oh, this area fucking hard.
[1079.51s -> 1094.06s]  Okay. Both headphones are going in now. Both headphones going in. I wonder if I could,
[1094.06s -> 1108.47s]  maybe it's better to parry this you think probably right with relentless enemies like this.
[1108.47s -> 1115.61s]  I think the play is always to try to parry like the first attack. This is a parry shield. Okay.
[1115.61s -> 1125.19s]  This is a parry shield in the wrong hand, but it's better than all right. Here we go. Let's
[1125.19s -> 1148.15s]  try it again. Let's see if it works. Christ. I'm dead. Well, it definitely got harder. Let me try
[1148.15s -> 1185.72s]  this again. Fuck. All right. You, I got it. I got it. I got it. It's hard to do that. It's actually
[1185.72s -> 1210.52s]  very difficult. What about blocking? Ooh, that person's got the right idea. I'm going to be fat
[1210.52s -> 1241.61s]  rolling, but it doesn't matter. That person's got it. Oh, oh my God. I hate these guys. Hey,
[1241.61s -> 1246.57s]  VOD watchers skip 15 minutes. No, uh, uh, don't you don't know anything. What if that, what if
[1246.57s -> 1250.89s]  it ends up being five minutes and that person listened to you and you were wrong? They're going
[1250.89s -> 1270.74s]  to be very upset with you because they're about to, you know, 551 51 601 64. Okay. Six 14. If I
[1270.74s -> 1275.24s]  hope they did skip 15 minutes because it's six 14, there's going to be something really cool
[1275.24s -> 1296.63s]  that happens. I'm going to make sure of it exactly when it hits six 14 reusing this bit.
[1296.63s -> 1302.41s]  I loved this bit. I was just going to bring it up. You guys remember the Spongebob VOD treasure
[1302.49s -> 1332.01s]  hunt. A lot of time went into that one. Jesus. I'm, I can't do it. I can't do it. I have a better
[1332.01s -> 1363.08s]  idea. Eight endurance Andy. I got a better idea. Give me the shit I had already. Where is it?
[1363.08s -> 1388.98s]  I have a new strategy. Oh my God. I tried to pick up the item that was probably going to be on the
[1388.98s -> 1403.38s]  ground and I just reset that. I think we're just going to get lucky with the crits. Just go all in,
[1403.38s -> 1436.31s]  go for it. Just go all in and hope that like my 30% crit rate works one at a time. I see you up
[1436.31s -> 1444.98s]  there. I'm going to play that game. That's fine. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. What, what happened? What's
[1444.98s -> 1479.83s]  going on? I just don't want two. What the, oh my God. Shit. All right. I'm going to go in. It's
[1479.83s -> 1503.82s]  three. Oh God. Okay. The other one disappeared. We lucked out. Nope. You're right there. Locked
[1503.82s -> 1521.85s]  out. Bucked out on that one. Good. All right. Now you just got to tank it. Your character looks like
[1521.85s -> 1526.63s]  you got dressed out of a dumpster behind a Halloween store the day after Halloween.
[1527.51s -> 1543.94s]  That was a good one. That was a leather jacket. Okay. Everything's going good. Explore down here
[1543.94s -> 1585.05s]  first. Should I go up? Maybe I think I can go backwards. Stop attacking for a second. So I'm
[1585.05s -> 1612.14s]  going to attack you. Oh, it's just unfair. The devs knew what they were doing here too. It's just
[1612.14s -> 1615.74s]  one of them runs up from behind you and hits you like three times. The devs knew what they
[1615.74s -> 1640.70s]  were doing here. I kind of want to go back though. Specifically for that, that reason right there.
[1640.70s -> 1647.83s]  First of all, that's a problem. And that person's already being annoying. It doesn't just annoy you.
[1647.83s -> 1661.66s]  It annoys me. I'm going to jump down in a second. I want to go up this way. Can I go up this way?
[1661.66s -> 1695.83s]  What? Are you going to do this? Oh, I can break it. Unburdened shield. What is that shield? Unburdened.
[1695.83s -> 1716.20s]  Seventy five point six thousand sixty thousand and one. A weird number. A big number. Blood of a
[1716.20s -> 1720.94s]  forgotten NPC. I haven't used any of these. I really should. I feel like the game's like going
[1720.94s -> 1738.23s]  to end in an hour. I'd do this with everything though. It's all to drink and eat at the same
[1738.23s -> 1745.48s]  time at the last boss. This is Resident Evil ruined an entire generation of gamers. It really
[1745.48s -> 1759.37s]  did. You know how many fucking red herbs I didn't eat? Yeah. You know how many magnum ammo I carried?
[1759.37s -> 1767.14s]  40 hours of gameplay to shoot and miss 12 times at the last boss and maybe hit once. One of them.
[1767.14s -> 1779.22s]  We've got to stop doing that. And you know what? I'm going to be the thing that I'm. You know what?
[1779.22s -> 1787.11s]  Let's start now. I'm going to start now. You know what? Let's start now. Right? Increases item
[1787.11s -> 1824.95s]  discovery. I'm using it. Let's go find something. Item hurry up. This thing's going to. I think it
[1824.95s -> 1854.44s]  died. Item actually worked. Do I have coins? I used 40 coins last night and I didn't keep them for the
[1854.44s -> 1860.46s]  one part of the game that I needed to keep them for. You know don't ever use any of these. Don't
[1860.46s -> 1871.77s]  ever consume them. Don't ever. Always hold it to the very end. I just proved it because now there's
[1871.77s -> 1894.36s]  a maze. Plus weapon degradation damage. That's pretty cool. Maybe I should do it. It's right handed
[1894.36s -> 1906.10s]  though. I'm a uh you know it's kind of weird. I'm a lefty in this game. I've never played an RPG or
[1906.10s -> 1910.26s]  any like from software yet and I've never been a lefty. I'm actually a lefty this whole time.
[1910.26s -> 1933.38s]  It's kind of cool. What about Zelda? Is Link? Link is left-handed in Breath of the Wild?
[1933.38s -> 1953.45s]  No right? Is he? Link is left-handed in most Zelda games. Oh in the Wii games he's uh
[1953.45s -> 1967.08s]  ambidextrous but traditionally left-handed. Oh. Henceforth I shall not interfere. That was I
[1967.08s -> 1973.10s]  don't know why that scared me. I actually have to apologize for that. There was like
[1973.10s -> 2001.24s]  no reason to get scared by that. I'm gonna open my phone here bro.
[2002.36s -> 2007.42s]  Bro I think I have the wrong address for the Halloween party. I'm fucking kind of freaking
[2007.42s -> 2030.17s]  out right now. Good thing I'm left-handed.
[2069.80s -> 2105.54s]  Shut up. All right here in Anvil. No I was gonna just say something. I want to just.
[2106.66s -> 2112.42s]  No I want to put my face into that and push the pins out. It's one of those toy things where you
[2112.42s -> 2117.72s]  push like your all the little pins they're like individual pins. You put your hand in it and it
[2117.72s -> 2130.82s]  makes a mold of your hand. How many of you guys did that? How many people did the like put your
[2130.82s -> 2140.17s]  hand like you know that you put your face into it? This place was once a facade. We crafted
[2140.17s -> 2144.49s]  decorative theatrical torture devices for the great ritual. We didn't want to hurt each other
[2145.05s -> 2151.37s]  That's a millennial thing. I'm sorry there's three of us talking right now. It's probably
[2151.37s -> 2171.02s]  hard to pay attention. Yeah it was a little it was like a weird what was it like a what was
[2171.02s -> 2181.56s]  that thing even called? It was a thing that it was a hundreds and hundreds of little little nails
[2181.56s -> 2192.10s]  right? What was it called? It had a name. Pin thingy yeah. It wasn't nails. No it was like
[2192.10s -> 2203.59s]  it was little pins. They weren't sharp or anything. It might not have even had a name.
[2206.28s -> 2228.54s]  Look at this. I need four fragment of tradition. Everything has a name. Pin art toy apparently
[2228.54s -> 2238.60s]  or it's a pin screen. Oh okay cool. Should I do damage or I keep complaining about stamina.
[2251.40s -> 2257.69s]  I don't think is that like a boomer thing? I feel like that's one of those toys that just
[2257.69s -> 2278.94s]  never ends. It's a toy that is always available forever. All right let's go. Actually I have
[2278.94s -> 2301.77s]  enough. I feel like I'm talking during the movie but hold on. I can't attack. Oh you thought you
[2301.77s -> 2321.24s]  were gonna get me? Nope. Actually wait a minute don't I oh no okay I thought I had one of those
[2321.24s -> 2345.70s]  uh let's uh to get another charge of my flask thing. Fable of glitch? What is that?
[2351.72s -> 2376.81s]  Oh it's for the it's for the smith source damage. Damn it. Oh fuck it's one of you. Nice.
[2378.01s -> 2396.74s]  She talks more than you do. I'm I'm supposed to be talking. Complaining well not complaining
[2396.74s -> 2401.06s]  but like addressing a streamer talking too much is like addressing the fact that your hamburger
[2401.06s -> 2427.88s]  has a meat patty on it. I just wanted the bun. Less talking. What about a vegan burger?
[2429.80s -> 2444.34s]  The patty. The patty in the middle. It's a chicken costume. What is this a reference to?
[2445.06s -> 2475.90s]  What is this? Hotline Miami? That is what it is isn't it? Yeah that's cool. How can it be
[2475.90s -> 2485.61s]  locked from both sides? I'm not going this way yet. It's called just unlock the door.
[2485.69s -> 2512.28s]  This should just lock from both sides. Okay I'm gonna put a thing down here. No and this one
[2512.28s -> 2517.72s]  that says not this one and then down right here I'm gonna write this one.
[2528.17s -> 2564.82s]  I gotta play it like Hotline Miami and why is this thing stuck and die a dozen times?
[2567.16s -> 2576.04s]  Okay I remember Hotline Miami 2. That was when I think about the most angry I've been on stream
[2576.04s -> 2585.69s]  on camera because let's be real like everybody knows right getting angry on stream I'm usually
[2585.69s -> 2591.06s]  not I'm usually it's like oh whatever I'm like annoyed for a second or it's like oh frustrating
[2591.06s -> 2605.08s]  for a second but I very rarely get actually upset truly upset on uh whoa holy shit oh my god
[2606.04s -> 2614.95s]  that was unbelievably ridiculous that last five to ten minutes my heart is racing right now
[2614.95s -> 2619.27s]  of how ridiculous that was guys wasn't that the most craziest fucking thing you've ever seen on
[2619.27s -> 2630.54s]  stream and you're into ever that I've ever done holy shit whoa I'm speechless I mean I'm talking
[2630.54s -> 2638.57s]  a lot but I'm speechless I really hope that nobody potentially skipped the last 15-ish minutes of the
[2638.57s -> 2642.41s]  stream that would be so oh my you would have missed something I can't I don't even describe it
[2646.15s -> 2661.24s]  I'm speechless right now I just got here oh oh oh but those who just got here uh 15 minutes
[2661.24s -> 2667.00s]  ago somebody told somebody to skip 15 minutes so I wanted to make everybody that did that um and
[2667.00s -> 2690.42s]  listen to that person um question it you missed it what it was 25 minutes ago no it hasn't you
[2690.42s -> 2698.01s]  calculated it wrong but lul I appreciate it thank you I like the sympathy lul I appreciate it
[2724.49s -> 2738.71s]  go don't fall down that all right I'm up here now oh
[2766.47s -> 2804.28s]  oh you suck say something else say something funny he's being toxic
[2804.28s -> 2817.42s]  okay that's all I can do here let's drop down locked I think there was another thing to do
[2818.30s -> 2835.80s]  this way blah blah blah blah yackety yackety yackety yackety blah blah blah blah
[2836.52s -> 2851.91s]  okay so the only way to go is up that way just was checking to see if there's anything else to do
[2853.74s -> 2894.78s]  and it does not so let's go she's done locked okay I gotta go up and around today I went here right
[2894.78s -> 2915.08s]  yeah okay this is the only way to go I could go down that hole that's the only way to go so
[2915.08s -> 2951.59s]  we're gonna drop down it's up one hit I must just turn the stream off after that that just
[2951.59s -> 2960.30s]  fucked me up so bad like I was so pissed that I said that and it just that actually
[2960.30s -> 2980.82s]  fucked with my head fuck it's how I know where to go if I held it for a little longer
[2981.62s -> 2991.70s]  I had a choice let me tell you what the choice was I don't want to lose 17 000 souls so hold on
[2993.62s -> 3000.17s]  you have I made a choice the choice was hold it for a long time to make it actually make sense
[3001.21s -> 3013.02s]  or stop it immediately and pretend hopefully nobody notices I chose probably not wisely
[3013.58s -> 3021.08s]  get out of the way get out of the way
[3029.50s -> 3054.78s]  I'm all right yeah imagine if it was like one hit why am I doing it again Jesus Christ
[3056.92s -> 3066.76s]  that guy swung so many times in a row one two three four five like I had that too
[3066.76s -> 3095.93s]  oh my god I'm not talking anymore for at least 10 minutes get off me what is going on with this
[3095.93s -> 3099.62s]  guy in the doorway what was going on with the guy in the doorway
[3155.64s -> 3180.28s]  do you like revenge of the sith yeah all right we're good
[3215.78s -> 3294.52s]  what oh green herb everything's good now let's go wrongness extra item where is it
[3294.52s -> 3318.34s]  stop all right made it finally yikes dungeon gate key up I'm not running through all this
[3318.34s -> 3337.98s]  shit again there's another one where is it where is it is it down yeah okay that's much better
[3337.98s -> 3374.44s]  there's three of them I think I'll be all right do you like dumb and dumber yeah yeah I am not
[3374.44s -> 3382.74s]  you're not making me do that you know any of these games I've played only the popular ones
[3382.74s -> 3392.57s]  that are very agreeable to play Dark Souls 3 Bloodborne and Elden Ring and Dark Souls 1 I
[3392.57s -> 3408.49s]  haven't done I haven't played any of the other ones I never played Dark Souls 2 Sekiro I played
[3408.49s -> 3441.27s]  them all hey do you like things depends on what that thing is okay I got to play this right
[3441.99s -> 3457.38s]  Dark Souls 2 is great but different yeah I mean I'm I played through the whole thing
[3457.38s -> 3465.05s]  just didn't stream it yeah probably I'll be really honest with you guys you would not have
[3465.05s -> 3472.07s]  wanted to watch that it's definitely at least three or four times at least no what am I talking
[3472.07s -> 3477.91s]  about they're probably three or four hundred times during my just solo just sitting around
[3477.91s -> 3491.48s]  playing Dark Souls 2 where I was insufferable I probably would have lost like 50,000 followers
[3491.48s -> 3499.58s]  if you had actually watched me play Dark Souls 2 people would be like holy shit I don't I don't
[3499.58s -> 3511.08s]  like this stream why what he's like he's he's being like he's saying awful things why why does
[3511.08s -> 3519.67s]  he keep screaming fuck as loud as he can he needs to stop doing that can you imagine somebody just
[3519.67s -> 3536.23s]  like fuck fuck I I did not do that I'm kidding that just hurts your voice I nobody would have
[3536.23s -> 3545.70s]  wanted to watch that something amazing has spawned no new silly though you sure are swell when your
[3545.78s -> 3555.22s]  cycle started an innocent uncorrupted NPC also appeared that hasn't happened for ages hey I
[3555.22s -> 3563.06s]  have a fun idea how about you find them and bring them a little gift from me an innocent wouldn't
[3563.06s -> 3570.34s]  be able to stay innocent long in this messed up world this guy's evil
[3570.98s -> 3593.88s]  oh stop I see a lot of people saying to do that and I mean it's like I'm stop telling me to hit
[3593.88s -> 3597.96s]  the pink guy it's like it was funny at first but like mods actually start timing people up for it
[3600.01s -> 3605.10s]  holy fuck oh that was the original title of the stream by the way I changed it last second
[3605.74s -> 3636.90s]  I think that's an instant kill move whoa oh my goodness all right I'm gonna be honest I don't
[3636.90s -> 3644.26s]  think you are real it's not personal but what is what is what is going on with that lately
[3644.26s -> 3654.34s]  have you noticed that what is without what is with that what is what is up with that
[3654.34s -> 3718.02s]  it's bad stand up where is this person can you do the touring test yep one two three four five six
[3718.02s -> 3744.22s]  seven eight nine ten um my fair color is blue and I like the alignment of the planets and shit
[3744.22s -> 3754.01s]  like Galileo figured it out uh over this is the train tracks with the five people in the one
[3754.01s -> 3773.96s]  person and I have to decide um no I only say hold on hold on hold on this is actually a
[3773.96s -> 3784.01s]  fucking huge problem if I don't beat him thank god okay I feel like I've been seeing a lot of
[3784.01s -> 3794.58s]  that lately like is he real thing it's like yeah bro I'm fucking real relax this is embarrassing
[3794.58s -> 3803.94s]  oh shit I think I am to be civilized or some grim echo of that process whatever it involves
[3803.94s -> 3809.06s]  I don't really care to find out and I don't suspect it'll work we've not spawned looking
[3809.06s -> 3816.42s]  the way they want us to be rendered but for better or worse this is who I am no torture
[3816.42s -> 3823.46s]  can change that it can only be torture please if you can find a way to mask what they hate to see
[3823.46s -> 3837.18s]  of me before they tear me apart can I open the door why don't I just open the door can I open
[3837.18s -> 3854.90s]  the door oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait very important you know usually when
[3854.90s -> 3861.91s]  you pick decks decks is like the there's only like probably two or three just straight up
[3861.91s -> 3867.96s]  dex weapons in this game I actually really like that I went into this dumping all my points into
[3867.96s -> 3876.02s]  decks and luck but you could there's a lot of you could do like hybrid stuff that's like the whole
[3876.02s -> 3903.29s]  point that's cool I like it what is this a reference to bloodborne vampire boss that's
[3903.29s -> 3915.27s]  not bloodborne Castlevania that's probably more likely yeah Castlevania all right so nearly
[3915.27s -> 3924.15s]  heroes were we and now a world needs us please find a way to cover what they hate of me
[3924.15s -> 3945.93s]  convince them I'm the civilized adherent they seek nearly we can okay your kind once upheld
[3945.93s -> 3954.41s]  all worth saving they ushered change to that worth changing it was not always their own wills
[3954.41s -> 3979.22s]  they served oh heap of the stolen crown five of your relics come on nothing here
[3979.22s -> 3993.72s]  oh this place is cool Dark Souls 2 scholar the first sin is the best from software game bar none
[3996.46s -> 4002.98s]  it's hard to do that after Elden Ring comes out because you know I think Elden Ring it's hard
[4002.98s -> 4008.20s]  to put that on the from software tier list because it's kind of every single from software
[4008.20s -> 4014.74s]  game in the same game it's every single one of them together so it's kind of like a hard
[4014.74s -> 4038.82s]  to put it somewhere friend have you found him have you found the king not yet oh wait I find
[4038.82s -> 4054.71s]  okay my heart is pounding my heart is pounding my heart is pounding my heart is pounding I did that
[4054.71s -> 4061.70s]  because that would be fucking crazy to see somebody do that you'd be like holy shit this
[4061.70s -> 4070.33s]  person is the real deal nobody moves like that I'd be like whoa all right I'm taking this person
[4070.33s -> 4101.99s]  way more seriously now shortcut to where unlocked elsewhere come on really yes I'm gonna keep going
[4113.34s -> 4131.80s]  oh no I'm gonna cheese this fight I don't want to die here help get me out here wait this is
[4131.80s -> 4143.24s]  perfect this is actually perfect there's no way his AI pathing is gonna get this right considering
[4143.32s -> 4192.36s]  where he currently is stuck what are you doing can he not come in this room oh my god I thought
[4192.36s -> 4214.01s]  he died I thought he was dead I thought I heard the explosion anti-hero uptight ass kick what
[4214.01s -> 4247.45s]  cobbled leggings that defy the establishment is right one valiant hero they're not all blocked
[4247.45s -> 4270.02s]  are they it's just a mess rooting voice potion Elden Ring is better than Bloodborne yeah but
[4270.02s -> 4301.05s]  it's kind of it's in Elden Ring Bloodborne is in Elden Ring they are they are one that's a bad take
[4301.05s -> 4310.65s]  I mean I don't think it is also this whole catalog spans like 15 years at this point
[4310.65s -> 4318.38s]  and it's they're very similar games that's why I mean it's hard to do it because think about it
[4318.38s -> 4324.73s]  think of like Super Mario Brothers and then they could look at Mario Odyssey it's like those are
[4324.73s -> 4330.81s]  both really great for their own reasons but Mario Odyssey kind of is it's great but I mean but Super
[4330.81s -> 4342.52s]  Mario Brothers is it's so good it's so classic it's hard to do that is Mario Odyssey objectively a
[4342.52s -> 4349.72s]  better video game than Super Mario Brothers like what do you think the answer is like probably yes
[4349.72s -> 4357.85s]  right but is it you it's hard to say that Super Mario oh what's the best Super Mario game well
[4357.85s -> 4362.57s]  Super Mario Brothers of course the original it started at all the classic is it a better video
[4362.57s -> 4367.72s]  game than Mario Odyssey that's that's you can't it's hard to do that you can't do that they're in the
[4367.72s -> 4376.84s]  same the same franchise same developers well for the most part right or at least um somewhat
[4377.56s -> 4398.81s]  Mario's been around for a little bit longer I just play games and like them that's a good take you
[4398.81s -> 4432.49s]  know what that's a great take all right let's not mess this up not this gigachad I'm a gamer
[4432.49s -> 4455.42s]  it's kind of cool that there's there's so many different genres of game they fill up so many
[4455.42s -> 4464.30s]  different uh niches a lot Super Mario World is probably the best I would probably agree with that
[4464.30s -> 4488.62s]  it's kind of sits right at that spot philosophy Andy yeah but whatever oh hold on a second I
[4488.62s -> 4508.28s]  want to see this that's Street Fighter Metroid Zelda um I don't know who that is that's Peg
[4508.28s -> 4525.46s]  Ganon Dr. Robotnik Diablo who's that up there Carmen Sandiego okay Carmen Sandiego the the
[4525.54s -> 4546.97s]  Madman from Mega Man uh who's up top who is that Freddy no that's not that's not
[4546.97s -> 4560.97s]  Freddy Krueger it's supposed to be Wario all right what about over here I think that's it
[4560.97s -> 4590.68s]  this river of blood is interesting I don't know what that was hero Stumper chainsaw it's a dex
[4590.68s -> 4610.09s]  weapon it's a pure dex weapon what this is not what I thought this was I thought it was just
[4610.09s -> 4618.70s]  I thought it was a chainsaw it's a chainsaw on a stick I wasn't imagining it was going to be
[4618.70s -> 4639.30s]  just a chainsaw it's a thrust weapon but I mean I don't have anything much better I'm going to
[4639.30s -> 4659.27s]  upgrade this how is it with it in my offhand I actually kind of like it I don't know what that
[4659.27s -> 4688.54s]  is but weird these things are not explode right whoa it's a comedy weapon it's one of the few
[4688.54s -> 4705.75s]  pure dex scaling weapons I've found in the game so far so it's a it's a weapon for me who is that
[4725.94s -> 4751.27s]  Bowser maybe it's supposed to be Bowser oh cool wait did I did I see in chat on the right straight
[4751.27s -> 4819.67s]  ahead who is that I couldn't I didn't figure out who that was Eman Sephiroth Nostalgaia once loved

[6401.50s -> 6415.30s]  move this over this has to move where's the room i'm killing you because you're just gonna be a
[6415.30s -> 6446.14s]  pain in the ass okay you have a two swing pattern that was weird and you know it all right that was
[6446.14s -> 6479.40s]  weird where did this guy come from i have to get this little shit out of here god damn it no don't
[6479.40s -> 6528.92s]  deep ice yeah do you cast your magical bullshit god cast your magical bullshit no one cares

[6556.25s -> 6570.18s]  just kind of shoots out it has nowhere to go okay how do i get over there i don't know how do i get
[6570.18s -> 6643.22s]  over there shit i have to go down so if i pull that one will that do it i don't think i have very
[6643.22s -> 6662.14s]  many souls anyways no i have to it's so stressful when you've got these lizard people casting these
[6662.14s -> 6684.17s]  weird spells all right so go over here and then i think i did it wrong i know it's too many things
[6684.17s -> 6724.97s]  to look at i don't know i feel like it's the other one does the i have to get up there and then
[6724.97s -> 6749.50s]  oh they don't know what to do okay i haven't been here yet oh i don't want to fall off the
[6749.50s -> 6781.08s]  fucking edge give me a safe spot don't love it i have to commit i have to commit i have to commit i
[6781.08s -> 6811.14s]  have to commit that's why you commit i don't have any heals left uh my heart my heart hurts
[6811.14s -> 6816.94s]  i'm not even up there either there's probably a dozen more enemies before i can get where i need
[6816.94s -> 6883.32s]  to go this is not even correct i gotta get up there and then around the corner um that sucks
[6883.32s -> 6895.46s]  i don't remember how to get up there oh i don't i don't is it all in the right spot still i'm so
[6895.46s -> 6912.81s]  sad what am i having to the reduced agro range that other guy didn't even see me oh god oh that
[6912.81s -> 6924.07s]  stinks i think i know where i'm going i see i have this issue when i'm under stress i'm not committing
[6924.07s -> 6933.26s]  anything to memory so in my brain this is all just a blank canvas with enemies attacking me right my
[6933.26s -> 6937.82s]  number one priority is not to remember what route to go it's don't die to the thing trying to kill
[6937.82s -> 6958.66s]  you so it may as well just be a blank canvas i think it's lined up already though yeah i think
[6958.66s -> 6975.67s]  so i think i'm all right and then through here and then this way get away from me okay thank god if
[6975.67s -> 7003.50s]  it reset i'd be very sad okay we're good things are going fine i thought someone was behind me
[7003.50s -> 7038.89s]  all right you two pieces of shit come on that thing is always like another second later a lot
[7038.89s -> 7084.41s]  of a blood of a blood of blood all right pull it and then how do i do i have anything that connects
[7084.41s -> 7093.56s]  to that one will this one move and go over there what happens if i pull it twice just go back to
[7093.56s -> 7109.78s]  the original bro it's right there i don't want to make oh i didn't want to make any decisions till i
[7109.78s -> 7176.09s]  got a good view don't rush my decision making there we go was there a lever did i just not see
[7176.09s -> 7191.70s]  it this one there but i need to move this that way but i could only move this that way if i go
[7191.70s -> 7195.88s]  that way over there to the left pull this one to turn it but i can't go that way unless i turn that
[7195.88s -> 7216.20s]  one to go this way so just jump there's no jump in the game there's no jump i drop down i need to
[7216.20s -> 7234.55s]  move that one can i get no i can't unless i drop down that's the one i need to pull so how do i
[7234.55s -> 7243.19s]  get over there all right very clearly it wants to move this one to here but the only way i can
[7243.19s -> 7286.49s]  physically do that is if hold on and turn it back he's so smart i always fucked that move up all
[7286.49s -> 7322.39s]  right let's go finally here's the door line it up spin this shit around again so now i can just run
[7322.39s -> 7336.76s]  up the stairs we're good this keep is rank with conviction and pride perhaps your patheticness
[7336.76s -> 7342.49s]  preserves you from such folly but that was a compliment your deal why are you always here
[7344.31s -> 7350.79s]  i told you to give my present to the innocent now he's been ruined by experiences thanks to you
[7350.79s -> 7360.87s]  how can i trust you again after breaking my heart suck it up reservoir it's not my heart that
[7360.87s -> 7367.27s]  matters evil the great one in this keep had swell intentions she wanted to remake the world like it
[7367.27s -> 7373.67s]  used to be but reversion is still transformation it doesn't really matter that suffering can bring
[7373.67s -> 7381.59s]  about change the problem is that change brings about suffering she made a boo-boo sound familiar
[7381.59s -> 7413.06s]  if you want to heal the heart that actually matters unburden her i'd like a checkpoint
[7413.06s -> 7442.86s]  can i jump out the window game stinks now we're in vampire land sure would be nice to have
[7442.86s -> 7475.14s]  50 000 souls right now that'd be great i feel like we're getting into the end game i'm wondering
[7475.14s -> 7498.06s]  30 dexterity what's the new ability refill access on use refill access on use what what
[7498.06s -> 7507.70s]  stuff even do refills access what is access i didn't even looked at that in the menu what is
[7507.70s -> 7521.70s]  its ammo it read uh that would be great and have wouldn't it wait are you sure refills your ammo i
[7521.70s -> 7546.84s]  can't put it on the hotbar okay um there's this way there's that way this is shortcut at the bottom
[7546.84s -> 7582.52s]  of the level i mean it has to be although this doesn't really make anything faster it's good to
[7582.52s -> 7593.67s]  have it unlocked in case there's another one it's good to know i mean there's a bonfire right here
[7593.67s -> 7652.22s]  anything to remember yep health boost on parry i that's a really neat feature i just want enough
[7652.22s -> 7681.53s]  to go level up one more time that should do it yes because i don't want to lose 10 000 souls
[7681.53s -> 7745.78s]  enemy is relentless what are my thoughts on the game so far i would classify this as a game that
[7745.78s -> 7781.75s]  i'm gonna give it the term hidden gem very truthfully when he said it's like dark souls
[7781.75s -> 7794.94s]  meets paper mario it's got a bunch of references and you know what else too it's a game that's
[7794.94s -> 7801.42s]  baked around a kind of comedy but all the comedy and all the humor and all the joke stuff
[7801.90s -> 7811.99s]  has been it hasn't been really heavy-handed or anything it's been very enjoyable so very charming
[7811.99s -> 7819.50s]  bundle of sticks had the king ever closer with each pixelated step was it truly happening
[7819.50s -> 7841.88s]  if they'd listen to this lady again
[7856.34s -> 7867.22s]  jesus
[7867.78s -> 7873.78s]  rocked by your desire this is peach run home
[7886.71s -> 7887.75s]  strength
[7904.47s -> 7914.34s]  okay
[7914.42s -> 7937.88s]  oh this place is
[7946.78s -> 7962.86s]  humility can't open this show your airy knuckles
[7965.51s -> 7989.67s]  all right that's a that's another time that person up 10 minutes you guys are so wacky i'm
[7989.67s -> 8042.28s]  getting too cocky trying to take two of these on the same time caught on a plant you never
[8042.28s -> 8049.10s]  used the chainsaw oh my god i forgot it was in my hand that's true i'll i'll upgrade it when
[8049.10s -> 8082.78s]  is this this is a friend no it's not now he's angry i gotta go upgrade this thing i definitely
[8082.78s -> 8141.13s]  do no don't whatever i'm running i can do that too you know i just think of uh fenrir from smite
[8141.13s -> 8172.95s]  see the whole world can't you not really all right here's i'm gonna do this good conviction
[8182.90s -> 8217.26s]  oh she said it bro what is going on right now it's
[8232.87s -> 8260.25s]  meat finish it the awesome stick figure crashed upon them like almighty thunder
[8260.33s -> 8276.42s]  rip them to ribbons my good fellow this is gonna drive me crazy
[8284.71s -> 8337.29s]  oh no get it turn it off turn it off foreign queens chill that one had a lot more health
[8337.29s -> 8360.42s]  shit i was lucky ah it can't be serious okay that wow uh-huh what the hell was that
[8360.42s -> 8393.88s]  i need to upgrade my weapon bro your cd is broken no did i put toothpaste all over it and cleaned it
[8393.88s -> 8408.06s]  off was that did that actually work i feel like that was a weird myth that was completely made up
[8408.06s -> 8417.02s]  that everybody kind of believed did it actually do anything something about the the crystals
[8417.90s -> 8430.94s]  in the toothpaste right something weird bro i'm just telling you like it was i'm just telling you
[8430.94s -> 8446.86s]  that's what i that's what people thought why did people think that anybody have like an actual
[8446.86s -> 8481.67s]  answer it was just wild speculation it worked on minor scratches it was a light abrasive
[8483.45s -> 8486.09s]  that could smooth out the surface so it wasn't total bullshit then
[8486.73s -> 8523.02s]  gosh tell gaya why is this weird right hold on humility
[8534.04s -> 8535.16s]  purify or release
[8543.93s -> 8549.64s]  faith are we releasing or we're purifying
[8549.96s -> 8556.01s]  you give me a poll release or purify
[8558.73s -> 8567.59s]  now uh i'll reach out to you for a second here give you a little bit time to decide
[8567.59s -> 8620.68s]  what are we doing release purify it's an important hint what she's saying wait say it again i want
[8620.76s -> 8631.66s]  to hear the whole thing i'm in faith right
[8643.27s -> 8653.90s]  release she said right she said right but i have to listen to chat here
[8655.00s -> 8667.64s]  she said you do not think that right exceeds your instincts fidelity is next to the all
[8667.64s -> 8682.62s]  sorry chat you picked the wrong one oops yeah there are a lot of spells in the game
[8683.18s -> 8717.21s]  that's a cool little easter egg oh shit wait isn't isn't humility down here okay
[8717.21s -> 8743.67s]  wait wait wait say it again what do i need to do okay lose the ego humble myself
[8751.46s -> 8761.34s]  okay step on the button all right i have to step on the button humble yourself
[8761.34s -> 8777.27s]  oh
[8804.04s -> 8816.95s]  i don't know is it a certain outfit where did this person come from
[8828.74s -> 8840.73s]  come fight me over on come fight me over on the button and see what happens
[8857.11s -> 8878.66s]  i've never dodged that move i mean this is kind of the opposite of humility i took all of my gear
[8878.66s -> 8886.90s]  off and bm'd that person i don't think i'll be able to do this i was so prideful that i was
[8886.90s -> 8915.99s]  proving that i could kill that person with no gear i think i blew it wait a minute whoa seven
[8915.99s -> 8946.46s]  thousand bucks i can put the whole set on now that's cool how it actually turns it into like a 3d
[8946.46s -> 9010.62s]  model i don't get it sit there for more than 10 seconds just wait there it is let's go there's
[9010.62s -> 9045.11s]  a huge ass tower perfect fit it's a big heavy thing it's like a roof minecraft tetris
[9055.69s -> 9058.81s]  okay
[9065.85s -> 9083.61s]  i think i've done all the towers still the ones that i know i can do
[9084.25s -> 9096.54s]  you know what games would you say the best at oh if i'm being honest it's probably games where
[9096.54s -> 9118.04s]  you have to press a button very fast clicker games name one game where that's important
[9118.04s -> 9128.62s]  name one game okay i'll tell you i'll tell you you little bastards
[9133.74s -> 9144.58s]  in metal gear solid there is a part where you have to press circle as fast as you can
[9144.58s -> 9151.32s]  to withstand torture i was always the guy in the room when friends of mine would play this
[9152.90s -> 9163.61s]  just hand the controller to jeremy it gets so hard it gets almost impossible but if you do it
[9163.61s -> 9169.11s]  and you do it the whole time and you actually don't you actually withstand it it unlocks
[9169.67s -> 9174.86s]  an omega item at the end of the game they used to hand the controller to me
[9184.84s -> 9194.60s]  you little bastards i'm sorry i thought it would be funny am i sorry let's go
[9202.54s -> 9205.74s]  now you know what yeah not not sorry
[9209.50s -> 9248.06s]  oh it's bold coming from somebody that's five eight you've seen me sprint i'm fast i bet i'm
[9248.06s -> 9261.77s]  faster than you now i can only do this for about one and a half full seconds before i have to sit
[9261.77s -> 9283.91s]  down for an hour but you better believe i've i've been running faster than you faster than a speeding
[9283.91s -> 9287.59s]  bullet yeah i would actually be a really bad superhero now that i sit here and think about
[9287.59s -> 9297.37s]  this even if i had powers i would run out of gas in in fucking 10 minutes i would be like
[9298.97s -> 9303.99s]  punch punch kick kick kick slide kick and i would take out one person and just sit down
[9303.99s -> 9313.14s]  and on the on a bench and just breathe heavy for like two hours just save me for the final boss
[9313.14s -> 9319.06s]  you know what i mean like you all right you can just relax for the entire time that like thanos
[9319.06s -> 9326.10s]  is attacking us but at the very end we're just gonna give you like an espresso and a bag of
[9326.10s -> 9335.16s]  Doritos and just all right he thanos is in that room we've got him cornered jerma get in there
[9335.16s -> 9348.58s]  and that would fuck him up so we have no idea and that's it that's all i would be able to do
[9352.41s -> 9355.93s]  and i would have to tell it be like hey hey hey wait before i get in there can you wear him down
[9355.93s -> 9360.89s]  so in 10 minutes i'll be able to kill him and they'll do their whole thing you know everyone
[9360.89s -> 9366.57s]  will fight of and it'll be epic and then everyone will be like defeated and it'll just be me in my
[9366.57s -> 9385.91s]  fucking underwear with like with like a fucking club and then he just like obliterates me in one
[9385.91s -> 9426.22s]  second oh this is a shortcut 30 000 souls you're 40 not 90 you could definitely do a roundhouse kick
[9426.22s -> 9433.10s]  yeah i would just queue up a huge roundhouse kick and just it would be really really shitty
[9433.10s -> 9438.46s]  my leg would only come up about a foot and a half but i would i would kick him with such force in
[9438.46s -> 9445.19s]  the stomach just make some insta puke and and then i pull like my i would tear some like two
[9445.19s -> 9478.90s]  or three muscles in my leg like superman kind of comes in and just laser eyes him why is superman
[9478.90s -> 9486.38s]  in marvel well we're talking about a multi-franchise level threat which who knows
[9487.42s -> 9493.53s]  you know like let's be honest for a minute here i feel like marvel's going so far into this like
[9493.53s -> 9500.31s]  phase five phase six phase seven at some point i'm expecting a like gordon ramsay style fucking
[9500.31s -> 9507.24s]  cooking show in phase seven like wolverine is one of the judges ad i don't know like captain marvel
[9507.88s -> 9514.57s]  and like fucking cyclops are competing and shit i feel like we're going there i like phase eight
[9514.57s -> 9535.93s]  i don't know what to do germa you seem like the type of guy to bring a lunchbox to a superhero
[9535.93s -> 9550.86s]  fight you know okay what about the magic rock that's in that lunchbox that has the power of
[9550.86s -> 9575.34s]  50 grenades i can say about that that's not powerful against like thanos but then i would
[9575.34s -> 9583.08s]  just distract him i would do the super funny comic relief thing where i would just be behind
[9583.08s -> 9591.13s]  Thanos and be like oh Thanos look over here and he'd be like oh what's that little worm
[9592.57s -> 9611.42s]  insect and i distract him long enough for somebody to hurt him he's the character everybody hates one
[9611.42s -> 9617.35s]  all right somebody said this one day and it was it was pretty funny you know sometimes you have
[9617.35s -> 9623.11s]  to have a little bit of humility right somebody said one day i don't know i by the way i don't
[9623.11s -> 9626.71s]  agree with this person but it was funny and sometimes you know whatever it's like if you're
[9626.71s -> 9633.69s]  making a joke whatever somebody said that this stream was a marvel movie with all the quips and
[9633.69s -> 9640.89s]  none of the fighting it was just like germa your stream is the worst kind of marvel movie it's just
[9640.89s -> 9653.78s]  only jokes and there's no action or anything it's just like quips i disagree i disagree with it
[9653.78s -> 9693.83s]  wait which one goes up this one it's wrong but it's funny oops oh no no that was you that got
[9693.83s -> 9713.61s]  hurt not me i would just freak Thanos out to a point you know what i mean like everyone always
[9713.61s -> 9722.17s]  expects like we're gonna fight maybe it just wouldn't even fight him we're just like one
[9722.25s -> 9733.13s]  i would be like i want to join you Thanos i will join you it doesn't he like when people do that
[9733.13s -> 9736.81s]  yeah and then and then like i don't know during one of the biggest battles there's like 10 people
[9736.81s -> 9741.62s]  and i'm there and i have access to like the pa system i was gonna fart into the pa microphone
[9741.62s -> 9745.90s]  and just fuck the whole thing up it's gonna be what the fuck was that what the hell's going on
[9745.90s -> 9775.24s]  and then the confusion they'll be able to get him oh my god that is so unfunny is that what he said
[9782.89s -> 9802.14s]  okay i need to cleared pretty much everything Loki tried that germa and look at him now i didn't
[9802.14s -> 9837.32s]  see and watch Loki wait Loki in the Loki series farts over the pa what no i go from here literally
[9837.32s -> 9883.13s]  yes he does liars liars liars liars all right there's everyone's line the word i'm getting
[9883.13s -> 9893.11s]  called out by my girlfriend here she said you would never publicly fart and you know what that's true
[9893.11s -> 9899.83s]  i would have the opportunity to do that to distract Thanos and i would be like i can't
[9900.31s -> 9915.54s]  it's gross no it's gross and that was what yeah i wouldn't be able to do it no don't open all the
[9915.54s -> 9939.03s]  doors at once wowie what a bad room to fight two of these things and god what is i don't know what
[9939.03s -> 9966.02s]  it does when it fills but i don't want to know what's this okay wait there might be actually
[9966.02s -> 9980.54s]  something here anything uh oh strength and source but i mean you get the bonuses for doing it anyways
[9994.02s -> 10012.33s]  holly not even you are safe from making random messages mean that's funny okay so now where do
[10012.33s -> 10034.57s]  i go you said i'm laughing here where do i go i have to like do something here hey apologize
[10034.57s -> 10042.55s]  for making me sound mean earlier too but what if you were being mean and i just don't know it

[11076.25s -> 11097.51s]  damn it that thousand people up here yeah it's uh swinging with the left hand just does more damage
[11097.51s -> 11104.89s]  for this exact character it was built it's precision to be able to do the things i'm doing

[11427.35s -> 11443.86s]  like i i i'm just trying so hard to form normal fucking sentences because the whole time you just
[11443.86s -> 11487.51s]  want to check this out i've had my eyes closed this whole time just opened up i've been really
[11487.51s -> 11511.16s]  mad at a game before and i'm just like i i i don't know do you see that all right this is
[11511.16s -> 11548.63s]  gonna be risky almost didn't get it we're good let's chill out there's so much shit up here very
[11548.63s -> 11554.04s]  good i have enough to open both of those things let's just not screw it up i'm gonna do this

[11618.97s -> 11637.45s]  ruined lifting barbell probably strength equipment load hmm i think i'm gonna put that on at 58 what
[11637.45s -> 11691.67s]  is it normally 67 it's really not that much shit this is 13 sounds good expensive but hopefully
[11691.67s -> 11762.22s]  there's something in here security code i think shaking no security code keep memory on death
[11762.22s -> 11811.08s]  pretty nifty mario mario mario i don't think that was worth 10 000 souls but i only have two heels
[11811.08s -> 11820.63s]  left um just do this again wait is there anything else here that i didn't do before i leave to
[11820.63s -> 11868.38s]  refresh so that's to go down i think i'm all right but i'll level up a couple more times and then
[11868.38s -> 11927.54s]  it's gonna be a lot i think all right how we doing cool let's try it again please listen to us the
[11927.54s -> 11951.58s]  bonfire at the top of the lift here but we only you're gonna have to only listen to the music one
[11951.58s -> 11979.75s]  more time because i'm gonna kill the boss right now can can we bet um yeah i mean if the mod wants
[11979.75s -> 12015.83s]  to do it i'm not fucking around this time as you'll see in a second i'm so curious where this goes
[12015.83s -> 12054.81s]  definitely goes up where the hell is that uh good luck everybody i'm gonna pop every cooldown
[12054.81s -> 12106.62s]  and run in there oh shit i thought i didn't have the heal on well that's unfortunate i thought i
[12106.62s -> 12117.43s]  had i didn't switch whatever she's she's killing me in two hits i'm kind of concerned about this
[12117.43s -> 12161.59s]  she's hitting me two times and i die how could you do this to me oh no that person's sad i know
[12161.59s -> 12170.28s]  that this is gonna give me crits crit damage up and off hand but i wonder if it's worth just
[12170.28s -> 12178.14s]  two-handing it i don't know i tried to do the thing in these games where you press the button
[12178.14s -> 12213.70s]  and leave but you can't you cannot do that maybe parry's would not vote yes on this i don't know
[12213.70s -> 12228.63s]  who's up to you do what you want with your points who knows she does that move when she
[12228.63s -> 12231.83s]  cues up and then dives forward slash i might be able to get it pretty perfectly

[12940.76s -> 12950.47s]  this i would use it so i have to go all the way back to that place underneath what looked like
[12950.55s -> 12994.34s]  firelink shrine i didn't do anything evil sticks nation of tradition breaker of meaning
[12995.22s -> 13011.30s]  your story is over roll credits what did i just get a wicked shit ending i just got a shit ending
[13011.94s -> 13032.87s]  oh wait minstrel this hero's story endures thanks dad appreciate it has lost his meaning
[13033.67s -> 13041.91s]  his purpose so he prevents the next chapter of your story from unfolding you must confront him
[13041.91s -> 13049.42s]  final boss grief as before has whisked him away to the start of sequence a place where meaning was
[13049.42s -> 13060.28s]  once conveyed it long ago became inaccessible to heroes we must find you a way inside perhaps
[13060.28s -> 13075.21s]  a way which your kind was never meant to see meet me below this husk of a keeper memory of a monarch
[13075.21s -> 13082.65s]  it's a little one that's tiny return to the edge of the wild you shall pry open the narrator's mouth
[13083.61s -> 13105.78s]  and extract the information return you okay uh this is where it is uh i'm gonna go up though

[13206.47s -> 13239.96s]  little brother how do i get back to the beginning of the game hey dude i think i saw you at the
[13241.06s -> 13256.17s]  at warp tour moshing in the mosh pit uh well i'm sorry to say that was not me it must have been my
[13256.17s -> 13294.50s]  little brother your little brother's got quite the life yeah it's pretty cool okay this is the fun
[13295.96s -> 13306.39s]  this is the fun time right return icon oh cool this is the fun part where i get to have no idea
[13306.39s -> 13314.87s]  where the hell i'm going and a thousand of you are gonna make fun of me the other 60 million
[13314.87s -> 13321.70s]  people that are here will be very nice to me and tell me exactly where i need to go and help me
[13321.70s -> 13327.77s]  and do the best they can to make sure that i can get there in a timely manner i'm just gonna walk
[13328.49s -> 13339.48s]  such as your nature yet you never succeed my success was never measured by the outskirts
[13339.48s -> 13347.40s]  seemed to want perhaps yours is not measured by your class and the kings such as i thought
[13348.28s -> 13358.46s]  the success of a father is measured by that of their progeny um yeah it's the bug viewers and
[13358.46s -> 13362.78s]  i got a huge huge bug audience they're super cool too they're always like super supportive and
[13362.78s -> 13374.81s]  awesome it's really cool i was thinking about uh changing the stream to be like bugs only like
[13374.81s -> 13382.44s]  no humans anymore how's it gonna be like a bug streamer it is done then the fanatics reign of
[13382.44s -> 13391.19s]  order has finally passed but the crown long repressed is now only ash forgive me but what
[13391.19s -> 13395.99s]  is a kingdom with no king what should be saved if there's no station to keep it safe when its
[13396.07s -> 13403.22s]  saviors inevitably pass here take this the heirloom too has been forgotten
[13403.22s -> 13411.08s]  nostalgaia has no need of it now good tradition died with the good king good tradition died
[13411.08s -> 13447.30s]  what is it strength wonderful point maker i have a final decision to make of what i'm gonna upgrade
[13447.30s -> 13462.50s]  but this is kind of cool what's the scaling everything wait i can remember this throughout
[13463.06s -> 13477.03s]  places never meant for of these corals leads to the npc city respite those facilitating the great
[13477.03s -> 13485.67s]  ritual cast off their costumes and simply be but it has changed to reach the narrator
[13486.31s -> 13494.87s]  venture through the npc city and into nostalgaia's forsaken tutorial find a staging room entrance
[13494.87s -> 13505.05s]  beneath the wiles and meet me within okay i was in a lot of those earlier meet me within okay so
[13507.24s -> 13527.99s]  i feel like i have no idea what that is i have absolutely no clue i remember walking around in
[13527.99s -> 13540.70s]  it i think there's one here somewhere to get there i'm just gonna run isn't there one of those here
[13540.70s -> 13560.44s]  somewhere i hear you're on good terms with the roaches yeah the beetles the ants the roaches
[13563.06s -> 13607.29s]  bees mantis that's dangerous staging area shit um my eye is so itchy do you like jumping spiders
[13607.29s -> 13641.27s]  jumping spiders are cute they have um they have a they have like a face uh staging area right here
[13641.27s -> 13683.14s]  all right here it is okay so this is where i need to be npc city npc city i explored down
[13683.14s -> 13694.49s]  here a lot so i'm actually kind of glad i knew where this was hello ah this is where i couldn't
[13694.49s -> 13712.26s]  go before but you were drawn from some forgotten time and space the memory of you does not fit
[13712.26s -> 13718.82s]  and that too gives you power fear not the shallowness from whence you came for its
[13718.82s -> 13728.86s]  meaning is multi-dimensional embrace the depth of what you are some areas have collapsed into
[13728.86s -> 13733.42s]  a one-dimensional surface you can traverse these areas by harnessing your inner flatness
[13733.42s -> 13753.77s]  approach this wall and think flat thoughts new ability flat counter when you see this
[13753.77s -> 13774.76s]  above an enemy stand still and press b i've seen that before in pc city so can i do it
[13774.76s -> 13800.94s]  from the strings with which he finds you you seek to confront the power of story
[13800.94s -> 13841.62s]  leave me to my misery oh okay is that you whoa this is weird what's this
[13848.50s -> 13858.07s]  hall of heroes wait this is this is the yeah this is the tutorial okay so this is back in the very
[13858.07s -> 13878.07s]  beginning of the game set it here can't really level up or anything but i keep going dude isn't
[13878.07s -> 13884.87s]  that so crazy in the tutorial this door was the end game imagine being able to walk through there
[13884.87s -> 13893.98s]  this is the last part this is the end game final boss through here it's so insane i actually do
[13893.98s -> 13900.22s]  think that's i like it's i like that actually interesting to me like you're so close but so far
[13900.22s -> 13905.61s]  i like it if you don't like it get out of here all right what are you doing here
[13911.51s -> 13975.99s]  here nice the memory saber strength god damn it yeah you unlock it here tail of luck why did you
[13975.99s -> 13984.57s]  have to do decks because in the first three or four hours of the game i found a cool weapon that
[13984.57s -> 13993.51s]  scaled off of decks and off of luck i know you're probably saying that's not true but it is because
[13993.51s -> 14001.03s]  luck gets me more crit more crit damage in my offhand the scales with dexterity therefore it's
[14001.03s -> 14023.77s]  perfect for the class that i'm playing right now i mean this is kind of rude modified cane of what
[14023.77s -> 14035.66s]  was it modified cane of helpfulness there's so many cool strength weapons it's just an axe
[14036.38s -> 14058.06s]  i feel like this thing is pretty good for being in the other hand and i committed to dual welding
[14058.06s -> 14089.46s]  as well that's why bloodborne oh right wait i just hit let me try that jesus dude wait what
[14089.46s -> 14109.70s]  what just happened i am so confused right now did that like stun him all right you gotta dodge
[14109.70s -> 14122.70s]  through that not to the left or to the right oh there it is of course you're gonna let me
[14122.70s -> 14132.70s]  have that item too but um it's gonna be strength strength decks can't put it on and remember it
[14132.70s -> 14159.06s]  though it's a lot but whatever freeze damage to abominations yeah cool it looks like a most
[14159.06s -> 14167.34s]  all right so it seems like a huge amount of items scale with strength decks deck source nothing
[14167.34s -> 14175.86s]  really scales with luck so i mean the crit thing is luck but there's no weapon that it does this
[14175.86s -> 14184.63s]  luck is not a stat that and you know what i don't want to talk to you but i will if you want to
[14184.63s -> 14201.90s]  heal the heart that actually matters unburden her maybe i should do this to something or is
[14201.90s -> 14217.05s]  this a bad end or something i i unburden something and i get the bad end i'm not doing it nobody
[14217.05s -> 14246.78s]  likes you that was mean i only said that because i look over a chat and i see everybody say leave
[14246.78s -> 14265.94s]  don't talk to him don't leave don't even look at that guy i just heard a uh huh where is it
[14265.94s -> 14302.68s]  what is the i thought it was a shadow i thought it was a shadow on the ground i didn't think it
[14302.68s -> 14353.03s]  was a bunch of holes i thought it was a shadow the hall of junior hero jeez not this again i
[14353.03s -> 14414.79s]  didn't read all right we're good left-handed all right cool good show what happened there
[14414.79s -> 14463.66s]  can you please do your chickadee d d noise no no all right no i don't want him this upset all
[14463.66s -> 14510.46s]  right let's do it again away away are you great killing right it's all your fault comes for me so
[14510.46s -> 14524.89s]  i thought it was you grave stealing rat you grave stealing rat and that's what i actually thought
[14524.89s -> 14556.25s]  it was can we just do the other part of the combo you're really making all of us mad you're just
[14556.25s -> 14586.20s]  making everybody mad now let's try this again this time i will be aware of that and you have not
[14586.20s -> 14605.34s]  aggroed yet so let me just cheese this i think that's cheese enough you too you still hit me
[14605.34s -> 14621.14s]  okay that's the i have a lot of points in decks that thing is actually saving me a lot of time
[14621.14s -> 14654.97s]  that's the one great reason to use decks that item and i feel like i still don't understand
[14654.97s -> 14675.59s]  how that thing works easy maker key drake saber oh remember i asked how to get up here wait a
[14675.59s -> 14735.58s]  minute oh my god this is very girl scout cookie um i like the mint ones ladder here too i'm not
[14735.58s -> 14774.62s]  supposed to even be here all right what was this for silver of tradition oh no hold on that is that
[14774.62s -> 14794.25s]  all that's here i think i've i've i've been here now yeah i've been here before yeah i've done this
[14794.25s -> 14833.26s]  already well that's cool that it wraps all the way around but how do i like this please play a link
[14833.26s -> 14840.74s]  between worlds right now you're gonna have to wait at least a week so you're gonna have to wait at
[14840.74s -> 14852.71s]  least a week and up to um a couple of years at least there's a range in there somewhere
[14852.71s -> 14864.94s]  and halfway through that range i might just not feel like playing it so i probably won't play it
[14864.94s -> 14932.94s]  oh i said come on this thing seems so cool reminds me of banjo kazooie talking holy
[14932.94s -> 14942.25s]  you should play kerbal space program dude is this a fake memory or did i play kerbal space program
[14942.25s -> 14951.08s]  one for like 30 40 minutes and i just couldn't comprehend it couldn't do it i couldn't stand it
[14951.08s -> 14959.58s]  and i was like guys i'm sorry i can't play this game that happened didn't it i remember yeah no
[14959.58s -> 14970.36s]  it really did i think i did not on stream is this is this has to be a real memory maybe i like
[14970.36s -> 14974.12s]  was gonna make a video on it and i was just like 30 minutes in i was like no fucking away
[14974.12s -> 14984.58s]  i never streamed it maybe i was gonna make a video on it that's probably what it is maybe when it was
[14984.58s -> 14989.70s]  it was really really kind of popular back in the old youtube days that sounds more accurate yeah
[14989.70s -> 15014.97s]  well that's what happened well jerma will please play animal crossing again i want to see your
[15014.97s -> 15019.69s]  island dude i'm gonna go back to that island it's gonna be a bunch of fucking skeletons
[15022.09s -> 15032.44s]  i i haven't played animal crossing in like a year and a half that would be depressing i don't want
[15032.44s -> 15061.02s]  to do that i have to start a new land or something this is such a cool feature udder annihilator
[15061.02s -> 15072.60s]  it's gonna be a strength weapon you don't come on damn it all right i probably don't have enough
[15072.60s -> 15104.23s]  to remember it whoa this thing is kind of amazing 100 of almost everything i can't remember it um
[15104.23s -> 15112.60s]  but hold on increased damage for remembered weapons very stamina regen speed is at 20
[15113.72s -> 15119.78s]  i need one i need to remember one more thing i think i can get there yeah i can definitely
[15119.78s -> 15166.39s]  get there yeah let's do it secret cow level oh my god diablo 2 so now increased stamina regen
[15166.39s -> 15192.98s]  speed that's huge you'd like actually go down that way but no diablo didn't diablo going into
[15192.98s -> 15198.44s]  like a beta or something in a month i've not paid very much attention to that game i've been
[15199.00s -> 15206.87s]  i've just been so i don't even want to know is anybody is it good has anybody tried it at
[15206.87s -> 15217.13s]  any of the times they've a lot of people to play it yeah i have not paid attention to pretty much
[15217.13s -> 15225.48s]  anything blizzard in god it's been since probably overwatch one maybe hearthstone a little bit but
[15225.48s -> 15275.27s]  not really not really i go from here flat there but yeah i go down there most of like wow wow
[15275.27s -> 15293.94s]  classic um i gave it a look i'll be honest but i mean just not into it anymore like at all these
[15293.94s -> 15320.25s]  are red i'm drinking this holy shit that's bad overwatch 2 is decent i've heard that it's i've
[15320.25s -> 15328.02s]  heard it's pretty good i just have no interest the only thing that would really want me to play a
[15328.02s -> 15337.59s]  blizzard game is if the uh like if diablo 4 is holy shit bro bro you have no idea diablo 4 is
[15337.59s -> 15341.91s]  you have no idea and then i'd be like holy shit i don't have i have no idea apparently and i'm
[15341.91s -> 15390.06s]  maybe that's right that's probably what it would take no bro you have no idea that's so bad that's
[15390.06s -> 15400.26s]  a run ruiner right there where you going we're going run ruiner i'm not gonna let you do that
[15400.26s -> 15422.71s]  i think that's the other side of the sewer thing that i was looking at in the very beginning of
[15422.71s -> 15482.06s]  the game who even is hitting who here any memories satisfying noise finally the smith where are you
[15482.06s -> 15513.91s]  finally the smith where are you oh thank goodness last time i'll probably see your face this anvil
[15513.91s -> 15518.87s]  must have been brought here from one of the npc's workshops we used to retreat to our staging rooms
[15518.87s -> 15523.67s]  to recuperate and to repair our battered costumes but these ain't costumes being forged here
[15524.47s -> 15534.17s]  this anvil has been pounded with hatred we use it out of love tradition is more than any instance
[15534.17s -> 15546.70s]  of its work the full power of the smith's hammer is restored we serve you always hero cool well it
[15546.70s -> 15549.90s]  this thing i'm gonna i'm gonna max this out because it's obviously for the build
[15554.82s -> 15565.53s]  i need one more of these to get it maxed but also do i want to upgrade something
[15567.10s -> 15577.50s]  the hammer serves that i feel like i need to do something i could just put the default dagger up
[15577.50s -> 15582.06s]  actually no it's this one although it's not remembered i feel like it's not worth it
[15582.70s -> 15600.65s]  i could put a point i could put one point two points in strength and one point in
[15600.73s -> 15622.78s]  source and be able to put this on but it's not remembered probably this the key is kind of cool
[15626.15s -> 15653.43s]  i have it memory unlocked dex 1.1 i probably would have done this one two point wait a minute
[15653.43s -> 15667.37s]  excuse me this thing is a dex weapon loot heroes loot i need to get this remembered where do i go
[15667.37s -> 15685.38s]  festivity row maybe that might maybe that's the other hand this one's 2.3 i had options here
[15685.38s -> 15701.03s]  gilded axe or loot heroes loot two point uh i mean this is 2.2 scaling i have it remembered
[15701.03s -> 15718.86s]  i feel like i could just beef this up like crazy this also uh this is kind of ugly this is a
[15718.86s -> 15739.05s]  two-hander this is unburdened but kind of cool i think it's i'm gonna go loot oh it's an axe
[15739.05s -> 15752.09s]  that's funny i mean if it scales this well off of decks then why not it's a guitar hero controller
[15752.09s -> 15776.97s]  let's level it up why not i definitely want this to be maxed out because that's the best
[15776.97s -> 15792.15s]  weapon i have for my character all right so where is it let's do it tradition right wait what do i
[15792.15s -> 15803.86s]  need piece of tradition so this is fragment of tradition fragment of tradition piece of
[15803.86s -> 15817.62s]  tradition 120 193 now what is it now 112 183 121 272 pretty good it's not even remembered yet
[15817.62s -> 15829.02s]  hammer serves the hero always so i have to go back to that kind of loot dungeon i really i'm not sure
[15829.02s -> 15840.26s]  where that is maybe it's right here that would be so cool if it was but hold on where does this go
[15840.82s -> 15881.75s]  repurposed cane of support the combo with these two together is way way better strengthen decks
[15881.83s -> 15902.39s]  i like this thing a lot it's great it's a great follow-up from the other side
[15902.39s -> 15914.92s]  good stuff finally got my build it only took to the last like 30 minutes of the game
[15914.92s -> 15926.12s]  every hero who spawned upon nostalgaia i told their tale defined their tellings this is the end of
[15926.12s -> 15942.84s]  your story start of sequence oh this is the i made it to the end zone we're not doing this
[15949.11s -> 15979.18s]  you're ignoring the peppermint guy what peppermint guy all of heroes wait there's a door back here
[15979.18s -> 15984.52s]  that i can open now all right hold on let me hang out here for a minute there's shit i can do here
[15984.52s -> 16000.73s]  where is some of it there's some of those glitch doors here somebody ate 30 peppermints and is it
[16000.73s -> 16018.41s]  gonna shit their pants um why are you eating that many what are you what are you doing have eat eat
[16019.21s -> 16079.46s]  three okay looking for a glitch door i heard it blinking where is it further away now what the
[16079.46s -> 16113.10s]  hell is making that sound is it just the torches and it's just messing with me it's in the wall
[16113.10s -> 16172.55s]  or is it down it might be all the way down oh look what i found what was the point of this
[16172.55s -> 16206.25s]  no point no point is it a memory maybe oh it's definitely that yes it is it's going to be the
[16206.25s -> 16234.49s]  target chess piece there it is i think that might be better it's 18 13 20 my fat rolling
[16234.49s -> 16256.44s]  shit i am well it's cool to know all right let me go back to where i was the shortcut here really
[16256.44s -> 16272.70s]  really really freaking cool my addiction to peppermint started around christmas i needed
[16272.70s -> 16276.30s]  him for a gingerbread house but there was some left and i ate the whole bag in a week and i ate
[16276.30s -> 16284.54s]  two bags in a week and now i would say that i eat 20 a day i'm gonna tell you that's probably not a
[16284.54s -> 16291.96s]  great idea i don't know how harsh that is on you but yeah and i'm not i'm not a i'm not a doctor i'm
[16291.96s -> 16311.54s]  not a scientist uh but i don't that does not sound healthy sounds like a lot but yeah um i'm
[16311.54s -> 16331.05s]  sorry that happened or thank you for the feedback i don't know what do you want me to say what uh
[16331.61s -> 16338.62s]  how am i supposed to respond to that hey dude i eat uh like i eat 20 fucking peppermints a day
[16338.62s -> 16353.61s]  what do you think it's a little abnormal apparently hey hey hey hey hey so grotto beasts
[16353.61s -> 16369.40s]  grotto beast account twitter is moments away from showing my artwork the artwork that i did
[16369.40s -> 16390.15s]  i'm curious i would go check it out all right so this is the way to get here that's great it's
[16390.15s -> 16406.82s]  let me hold on let me make sure this is my teleporter do you see it stop doing that i just
[16406.82s -> 16449.11s]  want to leave yeah i i did one guy the big sword shows how powerful one guy can really be all right
[16449.11s -> 16452.39s]  so there's two options i can either go back to the npc city and get to the end of that and see what
[16452.39s -> 16456.86s]  the hell's there or i can just go to the end of the game um it's only been like four and a half
[16456.86s -> 16469.29s]  hours i'm good i'm definitely good just to i mean why not i'll see what was at the end of it my
[16469.29s -> 16475.13s]  sword girl uh i wanted to go do the loot thing i don't know what the fastest route to get there
[16475.13s -> 16498.09s]  is from here but this thing is really good i really need to unlock it i think it's better
[16498.09s -> 16507.82s]  than the sword it's kind of a long way to go i gotta somebody please keep in mind how they
[16507.82s -> 16536.02s]  get here i'm not gonna remember this bet your ass i'm not okay so remember i need to go here
[16536.02s -> 16545.14s]  eventually and they give you a pan that's what's there that's it's right next to the smith somebody
[16545.14s -> 16565.45s]  remember that oh my god it scales with the yeah this is how you do it this is how you do it that's
[16565.45s -> 16578.38s]  how you scale it with luck this is how you scale it with luck that was in damage for a crit what
[16578.38s -> 16595.96s]  about the other one i can't do it to anything else oh no no no i can take this off all right
[16595.96s -> 16613.90s]  but should i just do them both luck because this right now is just do both luck 1081 with a 13
[16613.90s -> 16633.70s]  percent crit rating what uh-huh um it's over it paid off finally i just have to figure out what
[16633.70s -> 16636.66s]  that you know on a second and third playthrough that's when you you know you know what you're
[16636.66s -> 16645.13s]  doing all right so now i am going to go this way it's still a little bit more of an npc city
[16645.13s -> 16690.09s]  to explore and that is precisely what i'm going to do now almost 1100 1200 damage oh all right we
[16690.09s -> 16718.65s]  didn't we didn't get a crit but it was pretty cool i hear a uh glitch where is it where is it
[16718.65s -> 16773.10s]  okay i got destroyed i think it's probably i don't know on the other side i don't know maybe somebody
[16773.10s -> 16780.25s]  else will figure it out one day i don't think there are fake walls it's probably on the outside
[16780.25s -> 16826.20s]  somewhere that way can i not walk up um i can't really go that way all right all right anybody
[16826.20s -> 16835.19s]  have any idea how fast i can get to the loot place i don't think i even need it i am beefed
[16835.19s -> 16871.00s]  up like crazy these crits are going to be so filthy it's it's not even going to matter yeah
[16871.00s -> 16899.10s]  these crits are going to be filthy tutorial one attacking well hello not even a crit and it was
[16899.10s -> 16930.63s]  insane i want to see i want to one hit kill 271 normal that's pretty damn good jeez tutorial two
[16930.63s -> 16941.50s]  ladders rancid crits just downright abhorrent crits disease-ridden crits it's a good chat
[16941.50s -> 16973.19s]  message i try i thought it was gonna whatever yeah jesus why is that there that it's gonna be
[16973.19s -> 16979.75s]  to remember something guaranteed right there's no way there's no way that there's not a remembrance
[16979.75s -> 17003.83s]  right here right it's guaranteed friendly npcs oh that's creepy weird that's some game design
[17003.83s -> 17059.91s]  right there 15 access this is a really awful place to do this this i can't believe i didn't
[17059.91s -> 17092.63s]  fall off it was a lot of damage i have to commit i have to commit i fucking thought i'm just gonna
[17092.63s -> 17107.80s]  be behind me i thought he did i don't know dude it's what a bad place to fight he disappeared
[17107.80s -> 17165.43s]  and they appear behind you and grab whatever panics bad karma it's all right spawn you see
[17165.43s -> 17174.90s]  rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes
[17174.90s -> 17220.18s]  that's what i was freaking out about high five that's what you look like that was 2000 damage
[17220.18s -> 17251.70s]  in one second let's not blow it again please what happened doesn't make any sense why did i just
[17252.42s -> 17269.54s]  what the fuck uh i'm not it's so it's such a free kill too that's the worst part that's the worst
[17269.54s -> 17302.94s]  part if you got stuck under the ramp i don't know what happened that was weird let's take it slow
[17302.94s -> 17320.02s]  um i'm gonna take it very slow i think that is frost damage i know what i'm best in slot it's
[17320.02s -> 17348.87s]  gonna be increases your luck by like 10 all of heroes i gotta get some better end game
[17348.87s -> 17356.50s]  drip you know what i mean i know i know dude you're almost 40 i know you don't have to write it

[17507.16s -> 17544.62s]  i'm at the end game anyways beater does it really matter i think i'm gonna parry these guys well it
[17544.62s -> 17559.72s]  wouldn't be the last area if it wasn't difficult how long are you streaming for tonight until i
[17559.72s -> 17566.76s]  complete this game so whether that's 30 minutes from now an hour from now 10 minutes from now
[17566.76s -> 17572.01s]  this is the last area i just have to get to the end of it but you've seen how how that's working
[17572.33s -> 17599.48s]  i just had an intense craving for tabasco sauce it hit me like a ton of bricks just that like
[17599.48s -> 17624.90s]  oh i like tabasco sauce make a grilled cheese with tabasco sauce oh that sounds pretty damn
[17624.90s -> 17656.89s]  good actually i didn't even have to fucking look at you that's how good i am good go on that hurts

[17975.19s -> 17984.26s]  these claw enemies i hate these things these things suck they kill you in two hits
[17984.26s -> 17990.02s]  they're super fast they can teleport and they don't even have a body they're just dust flying
[17990.02s -> 17996.79s]  around and a pair of hands i know i want that item i'm just gonna run to it i ain't fighting

[18251.78s -> 18261.05s]  he fell for the train there was no choo-choo before that blew down just happened it wasn't
[18261.05s -> 18264.73s]  really anything for me to do maybe i guess maybe just block it or just stay i could i could just
[18264.73s -> 18275.03s]  step out of the way i think that's what you're supposed to do and not freak out in my brain i
[18275.03s -> 18280.79s]  thought if the in that split second of time that i had if the train hit me i was going off the map
[18280.79s -> 18287.61s]  i was like i've been hit by this train before it's gonna knock me off the map but let's um
[18287.61s -> 18308.84s]  will it hit them i fucking hope so oh my god i thought they despawned i was with why was the
[18308.84s -> 18313.80s]  train i was waiting for the train i was waiting for the train the train did not i have to go try
[18313.80s -> 18321.85s]  to okay i have to touch the lantern for the train to spawn i thought i had to just cross a certain
[18321.85s -> 18329.94s]  plane and the train would spawn if i walked past it so i'm gonna take it very slow and i'm gonna
[18329.94s -> 18338.82s]  kill everything there uh i have never really played f-zero somebody asked i've not played
[18338.82s -> 18352.73s]  f-zero maybe a little bit when i was younger back in the day i remember it being too fast is that
[18352.73s -> 18363.32s]  wrong no i'm thinking of a different game no maybe not i remember it being just everything was so
[18363.32s -> 18396.39s]  fast okay i kind of like hurt my head to play at least the old one for the super nintendo how are
[18396.39s -> 18426.66s]  you still alive what maybe it's not midnight it's only 10 30 so everyone that's trying to sleep
[18426.66s -> 18443.83s]  all right wait wait wait wait wait wait does it not happen again i think it's just a one and done
[18443.83s -> 18474.15s]  yeah i think just happens once consumables i believed in you we believe in you i hate this game
[18475.40s -> 18498.65s]  i can't they have to do the big burst oh my god there's no way that i get launched that far
[18498.65s -> 18521.66s]  i went soaring oh i get parry all right one and i fly back a thousand feet these enemies are really
[18521.66s -> 18532.81s]  tricky i'm not gonna let it beat me though i will win we're gonna do that by simply just ignoring
[18532.81s -> 18541.67s]  everything and just run to the end of the level check this out i want you all to pay close attention
[18543.40s -> 18641.22s]  class is in session fuck you oh yes i'm out of it finally i saved that whole thing so i probably
[18641.22s -> 18650.18s]  have enough what does this give you okay let's use everything that's probably the last buyer
[18650.18s -> 18679.85s]  i'm gonna save this yeah use all the crunchies um wait i gotta make sure i tether myself to here
[18679.85s -> 18701.38s]  it would be a disaster if i didn't let's see what is down here it's you again what do you got

[18746.22s -> 18808.25s]  it doesn't really match i he got like trapped he got like he's like i heard like a crash i know
[18808.25s -> 18811.29s]  i'm making a lot of noises right now but this is what happens when you're at the end of a game

[18924.79s -> 18938.38s]  difficult their swing pattern is weird there's two or three different kinds of these enemies
[18938.38s -> 18941.50s]  there's the one with the claws that have horizontal swings there's one with like a
[18941.50s -> 18951.48s]  axe or some shit who cares all this area if you dodge you fall off the cliff
[18951.48s -> 18968.54s]  it's a rainbow road of dark souls parody games you you would milk every last ounce of decency

[20576.98s -> 20613.08s]  i'm not moving through that there we go look go flat on the castle oh that's not that's actually

[21280.12s -> 21300.94s]  it's not fake one more point what should i put it into has there ever been a fake one
[21300.94s -> 21313.58s]  there has been one or two fake ones just luck again we might as well go all in i wonder what
[21313.58s -> 21321.66s]  the caps are in this game they might not even be any caps i know new luck ability well that was a
[21321.66s -> 21337.66s]  good idea recover health on critical hit take no damage well too bad we didn't get that that's
[21337.66s -> 21354.33s]  actually really good all right game it's time for you to show us what the deal is big reveal
[21354.33s -> 21377.91s]  gonna be slug one hit i hate you and i do let me spin a tale to show you your journey here was
[21377.91s -> 21393.06s]  easy what see nostalgaia holds her hero's hands but what if the story had held nothing back
[21397.06s -> 21418.17s]  uh okay i tried to turn into the thing it's just b without pressing any other buttons right
[21418.81s -> 21446.25s]  ouch and i just got triple tapped i got triple tapped because of this
[21446.25s -> 21468.44s]  fucking sausage behind me this cigar behind me blocked me from going backwards your journey
[21468.44s -> 21494.09s]  here was easy all right bring it on string it together give me like three more of those
[21494.09s -> 21501.94s]  there it is that's why you build luck some skillet arms does not a true hero make
[21501.94s -> 21542.22s]  heroism is in the heart and yours is cruel okay why am i this doesn't seem right all that was good
[21542.22s -> 21549.74s]  lies dead at your feet this is your legacy you wish to rid nostalgaia of evil
[21553.03s -> 21603.22s]  then face it well that hurts a lot that's annoying why can't i get the front stab
[21603.22s -> 21631.98s]  three hits is good but you give me a couple crits there it is that was weird
[21631.98s -> 21662.57s]  i didn't hurt my intimate now gg were it only so easy everything i love destroyed

[21718.81s -> 21742.47s]  so hard i have hated what i feared you were a hero is no longer mine to tell if you truly be
[21742.47s -> 21755.29s]  different than the rest of your kind my study find the threads they're in and sever them

[21866.68s -> 21871.80s]  the final level of this game harder so you wouldn't be able to beat it making your sleep schedule a
[21871.80s -> 21880.52s]  little bit more difficult difficult enough for me to kill vinnie what is what is that
[21881.67s -> 21893.93s]  what character is that what characters are these who's this mustard guy i don't know what this is

[22139.90s -> 22145.54s]  remember a lot of openings a lot of places to go a lot of things to see a lot of things to do
[22145.54s -> 22152.02s]  a lot of places to look at a lot of enemies to attack a lot of things to do a lot of things
[22152.02s -> 22212.12s]  to be a lot of places to see found it correct oh yes no what's going on in here definitely
[22212.12s -> 22236.07s]  remember something what is this strength the memory saber the almighty inspiration had always
[22236.07s -> 22242.49s]  been treated as set dressing a thematic arch type merely used for props but purposelessness
[22242.49s -> 22248.70s]  led many npcs and heroes to try and grasp the ungraspable they formed cults creeds and
[22248.70s -> 22254.36s]  superstitions trying to make meaning out of their now meaningless existence the institutions they
[22254.36s -> 22281.32s]  formed were abominations uh and there was a problem anything else it's a cold room all right

[23453.14s -> 23470.33s]  for fucking years it's been years that's what i'm talking about that's what i mean aggression
[23470.33s -> 23477.13s]  aggressive only sekiro taught me that what do you say overconfidence could be a slow and insidious
[23477.85s -> 23539.90s]  make sure you kill fast that's weird i'm telling you i wanted to oh oops get out of my domain
[23548.10s -> 23567.88s]  who's next what are they all gonna attack me at the same time i thought they're all gonna run in

[23808.73s -> 23822.02s]  loud loud this game is i turned it down to where is that where the hell is that that was a demon
[23822.02s -> 23848.06s]  face does everybody remember what that is it's in the demon room by the shop yeah in hell with the
[23848.06s -> 23882.47s]  pink guy the shop at the market square market square yeah second area of the game can somebody

[23983.21s -> 23987.05s]  the path by the shop there's a trek down a snowy mountain with some tough monsters for this early
[23987.05s -> 24006.78s]  in the game make it at the bottom though and there's a cave this can be remembered here let
[24006.78s -> 24019.35s]  me use my points there we go what's the one of the last luck abilities with something crazy right
[24019.35s -> 24031.78s]  okay take no damage so there's a one percent chance that i don't take damage whenever i get hit
[24031.78s -> 24065.67s]  or what do these percentages mean okay so it's guys i'm standing here which way i'm seeing behind
[24065.67s -> 24076.42s]  you behind you there's only one shop in the game yeah but this was three days ago it may as well
[24076.42s -> 24095.32s]  has never happened well he's wait what about this thing down here i'm curious about this
[24095.32s -> 24109.59s]  where are my friends i'm not too proud to admit you've taught me much old friend rules cannot
[24109.59s -> 24116.23s]  prevent a hero from fulfilling their destiny we were not spawned accepted so we surpassed
[24116.23s -> 24122.63s]  expectation look upon me now great ones look and tremble
[24122.71s -> 24133.77s]  oh i will face the pipe layer i make my own destiny i make all right what about you i have
[24133.77s -> 24140.89s]  literally only two people made it no three gone off script have you most noble heroes follow the
[24140.89s -> 24151.11s]  path prescribed between you and i i do not know how a single great one yet remains between you
[24151.11s -> 24156.55s]  and an open heart the pipe layer pipe layer stood within the layer of the adversary when you have
[24156.55s -> 24162.71s]  done all else you require seek the unbreachable more beneath or shaft there's a well-traveled
[24162.71s -> 24168.55s]  path along the now sunken crater when you have done all else there when you have done there is

[27387.27s -> 27393.62s]  meaningful about this item a legacy that can live on in you returning this to nostalgaia through
[27393.62s -> 27412.76s]  her beacons will increase the use of your heroic icon well i probably missed what too cool 45 is
[27412.76s -> 27418.33s]  keep memory on death i wonder if i got i might i probably won't probably won't get there all right
[27418.33s -> 27438.22s]  what is through here where this is the this has got to be the final arc of the game hold up okay
[27438.22s -> 27474.90s]  the whole thing's coming down you said that three ox ago why are you questioning me if i had 40 or
[27474.90s -> 27497.98s]  50 decks these would hit for a lot more i got them all back too i didn't want to lose the lock
[27497.98s -> 27519.11s]  on so the final boss is absolutely super mario right in quotes there's no way this is not mario
[27519.11s -> 27526.42s]  behind one of the behind the big door there's no way shield uh the the area what happened

[27623.53s -> 27629.03s]  of course you're making it easier to stagger enemies i wonder if that's probably something i
[27629.03s -> 27681.58s]  should do hmm what is that for i don't know oh i'm very confused what about your lasagna
[27681.58s -> 27695.67s]  there's definitely 15 minutes left in this game i'm at the very core of the earth see it doesn't
[27695.67s -> 27777.40s]  shake like that unless you're in the deep end of the crust this shit was already open weird
[27777.40s -> 27812.28s]  umbrella i climb that i can't climb this what's the purpose of this it's gotta be worth like at
[27812.28s -> 27825.19s]  least a couple gold can i go flat out here no i don't think so it doesn't look like it
[27825.19s -> 27899.02s]  hmm i'm not jumping down that's a big mistake or bugged out okay listen to music all right
[27899.02s -> 27988.50s]  what's up chainmail thong chainmail bikini this thing is heavy meat pong on and go up
[27988.58s -> 28057.64s]  come on nope that is a gigantic bed this bet is ridiculous this thing is huge

[28362.46s -> 28381.34s]  went to the bathroom did some did some squats got a drink let's finish this up and i really got to
[28381.34s -> 28386.20s]  beat this in the next 30 minutes because that's when the edible is going to kick in so i better
[28386.20s -> 28445.70s]  hurry the freak up kidding it's 1 30 in the morning okay let's go and who might you be it is i jock
[28445.86s -> 28459.22s]  geek of the thong kingdom no you know what you can just call me jock you can call me
[28459.22s -> 28488.97s]  fucking jockstrap what is this little shimmy oh my goodness dude well this is going to be um
[28488.97s -> 28505.80s]  barely difficult jockstrap didn't quite make it do i have to shimmy every single time here i can't
[28505.80s -> 28594.66s]  just open the door all right strategy is just dodge one two and it's a spin what the dude this
[28594.66s -> 28613.35s]  guy wait you're holy shit man you're annoying just turn around turn around turn around come on
[28613.35s -> 28652.12s]  but he's small he's small get him when he's small get him when he's small where what what
[28652.12s -> 28695.24s]  just excuse me full health again dude what he jumped on the throne do i have a very important
[28695.24s -> 28715.00s]  question we're gonna see my what is it called fragment of tradition i think i can get something
[28715.00s -> 28724.49s]  to max level now right piece of tradition there it is uh if i have a if i keep having trouble here
[28724.49s -> 28738.26s]  i'm probably gonna have to upgrade the weapons something tells me when you get them down to
[28738.26s -> 28758.78s]  really small maybe i can do something the loot too yeah we'll see i wonder if there's any strategy
[28758.78s -> 28769.83s]  i don't know maybe parries i feel like let me let's you know what i'm gonna try let's try parries
[28769.83s -> 28789.30s]  get that shit out of here it's an annoying move he's so slow it's gonna be so hard to parry
[28795.19s -> 28805.75s]  can't even i can't even get up i couldn't even move he switches back and forth from unbelievably
[28805.75s -> 28832.97s]  slow to unbelievably fast he's one of those dumb bosses you can't just you can't oh why can't i
[28832.97s -> 28864.97s]  not open this why why can't i open that no parry's not gonna work parry's not gonna cut it
[28864.97s -> 28877.13s]  there's got to be a catch to when you get them small turtle with the shield i'll try it one more
[28877.13s -> 28891.77s]  time where is the attack where is the attack opportunity on this asshole like the guy just
[28892.01s -> 28903.74s]  like what even if i got in there i wouldn't have time to swing one time even if i got in there he's
[28903.74s -> 28910.26s]  already doing another move and you just get hit for me to go like this i'm in he's already swinging
[28910.26s -> 28920.74s]  again uh all right i gotta i'm gonna go upgrade like here's the great question i am so far i don't
[28920.74s -> 28940.84s]  think i can maybe through the staff room i could probably do the staff room but i honestly i was
[28940.84s -> 28949.54s]  running through this so fast because this last area has been just chaos which is apps just just
[28949.54s -> 28960.50s]  carnage at every corner that whole last 40 minutes was a blur i don't remember how i got
[28960.50s -> 28980.58s]  in here i remember just sprinting through because it was just a fucking mess on i can't even see
[28980.58s -> 29036.38s]  myself on the screen all right let's go mario jesus dude what the fuck what are you doing
[29040.52s -> 29061.69s]  oh my god stop swinging the fucking weapon for one second get him small then it's free
[29061.69s -> 29077.50s]  this asshole was jumping around everywhere just be patient this the the attack opportunities seem
[29077.50s -> 29086.14s]  like zero for the for as long as me to go like this he's already doing something else the fuck
[29103.59s -> 29134.63s]  under leveled no way 63 what what should i be 80 103 okay no one two one two two three
[29134.63s -> 29158.70s]  three flip flip flip yep get me out of that come on man that's not cool that's not cool it takes
[29158.70s -> 29204.25s]  so long to get up it takes so long to get up no i didn't want to press that god damn it happened
[29204.25s -> 29248.31s]  to fucking go i pressed x accidentally little shit no it's get over here no mushroom there for
[29248.31s -> 29301.50s]  you now is there dickhead god damn it i'm just trying to get the fuck away from them
[29301.50s -> 29323.53s]  come here you little shit i die where am i oh shit in my fucking pants he's going up again
[29324.33s -> 29347.22s]  that don't work what uh oh what does that mean what does that mean what does that mean what does
[29347.22s -> 29394.44s]  that mean where did you just go dude i didn't mean to do that i'm an idiot die
[29400.31s -> 29426.47s]  get out of my life mario oh yes i like the bat chest bat chest get out of my life mario oh he
[29426.47s -> 29447.77s]  said it let me see what that is it wants me to do this so bad i might as well that was hard all
[29447.77s -> 29452.58s]  right so that that was that was pretty cool that was that was very difficult that was tricky
[29453.22s -> 29466.10s]  here's the pipe 30 strength oh take that mario i was trying to think of something really cool
[29466.10s -> 29482.76s]  to say at the last hit like two in the morning van give me a little bit of slack and just lance
[29483.88s -> 29502.52s]  cool all right let's uh let's see the end what do take the throne okay the adversary's empty
[29502.52s -> 29508.10s]  throne sits before you the epicenter of nostalgaia's conflict you have liberated
[29508.10s -> 29512.26s]  and restored so much perhaps if you claim this authority for yourself you could be the one to
[29512.26s -> 29549.32s]  fix all of nostalgaia's problems here's the thing not quite the thing beneath here it lies open for
[29549.32s -> 29573.24s]  you enter it ready for all of this to end uh might as well just keep it going good luck helps so much
[29574.60s -> 29580.07s]  all right so that that was probably bad end or maybe one of the i imagine there's probably two
[29580.07s -> 29587.70s]  three endings but here we go this is this good end you think find out memory flows freely into
[29587.70s -> 29591.94s]  nostalgaia's open heart she's ready to receive you when you are ready to complete your heroic
[29591.94s -> 29596.81s]  journey give your memory back to the world all right so i have to give all my memories back
[29597.53s -> 29604.22s]  or i just take the throne but i'm curious let's see what happens warning this will end the game
[29604.86s -> 29617.99s]  i cut the cord yeah you want to pull what do you guys think should we pull it up i mean you
[29617.99s -> 29626.52s]  guys stuck around for this long i feel like you should have a say let's go for it take the throne
[29626.52s -> 29637.27s]  or restore the memory and by the way i can veto either one so nah i want to do this never mind
[29638.66s -> 29656.73s]  i'm doing this never mind game over sorry everybody okay oh well it was 82 percent anyways
[29657.69s -> 29678.87s]  jesus oh my god is this it's gonna be another thing at the end right
[29679.67s -> 29704.34s]  oh my god i'm so sorry most credits let's find out i didn't i i have my game volume turned pretty
[29704.34s -> 29717.77s]  far down too all right are you ready for the review are you ready for the review that last
[29717.77s -> 29732.54s]  area was a mess but there's a lot of really cool shit in this game i feel like you could play
[29732.54s -> 29736.54s]  through it a couple times with different types of classes i love the memory thing that's a really
[29736.54s -> 29744.20s]  nice twist on upgrading weapons super cool game was actually pretty phenomenal i would say
[29746.52s -> 29751.16s]  i'm gonna be i'm gonna be weird here i'm gonna be weird here i think i don't think a lot of
[29751.16s -> 29791.58s]  people are expecting this this is a um this is a this is an 8.7 there it is 8.7 this is yeah that
[29791.58s -> 29805.11s]  was great that was like very very very fun i would say that was great i i i think this is not a seven
[29805.11s -> 29816.04s]  if you take away the memory aspect of this game i think that's bumping it up a whole letter grade
[29816.04s -> 29828.52s]  for me that system is really unique and deserves praise the 8.7 that was great was it better than
[29828.52s -> 29833.56s]  eternal cylinder i mean i give what i give eternal cylinder like a 6.7 or like a seven or something
[29833.56s -> 29854.86s]  like that 7.5 yeah i think this the this game was way more than i ever expected i've really really
[29854.86s -> 29866.98s]  enjoyed it somebody said this earlier i've played i've how many times have you seen me attempt to
[29866.98s -> 29872.86s]  play as souls like in quotes and i kind of just like yeah that was like kind of fun for three four
[29872.86s -> 29881.16s]  hours but i'll move on that happens a lot i've i know i have loaded up on this stream and off stream
[29881.16s -> 29887.32s]  too at least a half dozen souls likes and i just kind of give up in the first like four or five
[29887.32s -> 29894.87s]  hours i did not do that with this this this kept my attention the whole time it's got that crazy
[29894.87s -> 29900.07s]  every single thing is connected dark souls one for all of you dark souls one brains out there
[29900.07s -> 29909.37s]  um i'd say you probably would like that i thought it was very very good i thought it was great
[29910.01s -> 29917.43s]  and to me somewhere in the eights is great not quite a nine i think nine implies it's like
[29917.43s -> 29927.00s]  incredible i think that was great and there's a lot of i didn't see there's probably a couple
[29927.00s -> 29931.16s]  areas i probably kind of ran through skipped over that last area was a little messy but
[29931.16s -> 29936.94s]  all in all can't complain all in all the games in eight point uh seven not like me reviewing
[29936.94s -> 29946.26s]  anything matters be giving a score is is it doesn't really mean very much but it's great
[29946.26s -> 29973.61s]  all right everybody what about the blunt rotation oh shit okay uh pink eye's not coming anywhere
[29973.61s -> 29984.62s]  near like where i live i just want to make that really clear um probably the lasagna that i
[29984.62s -> 30008.20s]  didn't eat the guy that betrayed us in the end and the uh the old the old guy also the game's
[30008.20s -> 30015.32s]  like an eight high kind of mid to high eight for me just because i actually might play it again
[30015.32s -> 30021.56s]  off stream just like in my own time and play like a sorcery that's how i can tell that like all right
[30021.56s -> 30030.07s]  all right so that should be a couple of notches higher it's got multiplayer too isn't that
[30030.07s -> 30043.53s]  actually though well done collapse in the chat for the developers i don't know how much is this game
[30043.53s -> 30065.80s]  seems like it's got a lot of secrets how much does this cost it's 25 bucks 25 bucks it's got
[30065.80s -> 30076.70s]  a demo too that's that's fair as hell fair as hell uh nice job that game was great i will see
[30076.70s -> 30088.81s]  you guys in a few days probably be live on wednesday i think did three days in a row here
[30088.81s -> 30100.04s]  probably take two days here i don't know if i'm i i i really like doing these i say this every
[30100.04s -> 30104.76s]  single stream i feel like at the end of the the late night streams but they they hit so different
[30104.76s -> 30116.52s]  that i just it's probably staying have a great night get some sleep see you later take care
[30116.52s -> 30132.78s]  of yourselves it's kind of a clean slate as of this coming week don't really have anything planned
[30132.78s -> 30152.84s]  so we can maybe fill in some stuff it's been a wonderful night yeah it's been great hope you
[30152.84s -> 30162.50s]  had a good time what about sorcery please please i'll probably pick what's gonna have to happen is
[30162.50s -> 30167.21s]  i'm gonna have to catch myself back up with what happened in sorcery we might we might have to do
[30167.21s -> 30173.56s]  a little recap stream where we said we have to kind of remember what happened and go from there
[30173.56s -> 30186.22s]  because i was sort of a third of the way through the third episode i enjoyed my stay and then you
[30186.22s -> 30208.34s]  drew a dick all right i'll let it slide it got removed hey as as the mods have famously said
[30208.34s -> 30217.70s]  i would be banned from my own stream and i would be banned from my own discord and we gotta have
[30217.70s -> 30227.69s]  we have to have order though you know what i mean there has to be order right otherwise it just
[30227.69s -> 30243.56s]  develops devolves into just chaos you gotta have we have to have an order all right good morning
[30245.86s -> 30258.65s]  good night whichever one uh everyone will do it for you now have a beautiful night see you soon
[30258.65s -> 30307.69s]  and call your mother for god's sakes gone yet i just wanted to address something in chat it was
[30307.69s -> 30312.89s]  pretty funny somebody said i keep calling my mother and she keeps asking about sorcery and
[30312.89s -> 30323.93s]  i don't know what to tell her uh still would have waited a little bit longer all right see you wednesday
