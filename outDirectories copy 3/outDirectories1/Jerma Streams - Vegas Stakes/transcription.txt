[1.72s -> 3.72s]  I didn't realize this was still playing.
[9.56s -> 13.14s]  One more time, all right.
[17.93s -> 24.51s]  All right, I'll- all right, it's off. I'm turning it off. Hold on.
[24.51s -> 29.04s]  Oh, you're set, makers.
[29.68s -> 31.92s]  I'm not doing it one more time.
[32.24s -> 39.44s]  The next game we're gonna play for an hour or two. Although, who knows?
[39.44s -> 42.88s]  This might be one of the ones that I don't stop for a while.
[43.04s -> 49.04s]  It's a classic one, my favorite that I ever owned in my whole life, and favorite SNES games ever.
[51.20s -> 52.72s]  Vegas Steaks.
[52.72s -> 58.92s]  Those of you know what that is. It's not Team Fortress, it's not Super Nintendo. It's a casino game. That's right.
[59.40s -> 72.50s]  This game, you gotta get to a million dollars, and if you don't get to a million dollars, then you lose.
[72.94s -> 85.46s]  This game actually is very, very, very good. Let me change the title. Another casino game.
[85.82s -> 89.13s]  It's- it's gonna- I'm telling you, you guys are gonna like this.
[89.53s -> 95.73s]  Random NPCs come up to you in this game, and they like try to take money from you and shit. You're getting, like, fights.
[95.73s -> 107.90s]  Yeah, I'm telling you, you guys are gonna like this. You know, Inc. Never Again? Well, I already did it.
[109.18s -> 136.49s]  I already did Casino Inc. Let me get this right. All right, what should I title it? Road to a Million Dollars?
[138.29s -> 148.95s]  Road- I'm- it's gonna be Road to a Million. That works for me.
[149.39s -> 152.08s]  Make it E. Why would I make it just E?
[152.76s -> 154.74s]  It's not gonna happen.
[154.74s -> 165.21s]  All right, you guys ready? Las Vegas.
[168.06s -> 187.15s]  Vegas States. Vegas Adventure. When are we going to get there? I'm so tired of riding in this car.
[187.15s -> 196.71s]  Oh, quit complaining. We'll be there soon enough. Well, it'll be nice to stretch my legs and walk around.
[197.23s -> 206.40s]  I'm not complaining, just anxious to get there. Blackjack, sloth, roulette, craps, and poker. Which game should I play first?
[206.92s -> 211.38s]  Well, I'm heading right to the poker table. That's where I'll make my riches.
[212.38s -> 214.94s]  I don't know how to play poker, so I'm not gonna be doing that.
[214.98s -> 218.99s]  Hope I don't lose my shirt like I did the last time I went to Las Vegas.
[219.83s -> 226.26s]  We're here. Good luck and remember to go out in pairs. It'll be more fun. I don't know how to play poker.
[226.26s -> 230.50s]  I really don't. Like, I know like the basics of poker, but I don't know how to like look at a guy and be like,
[230.50s -> 233.98s]  Nah, fuck you. I bluffed you and then I lose a hundred thousand dollars. I don't know how to play.
[234.62s -> 241.14s]  You- all I know about poker is you wear sunglasses and just like- you're like the guy sleeping in the back of class.
[241.66s -> 245.94s]  That's how you be a good poker player. It's just emulate every college student that's sitting in the back.
[246.74s -> 252.66s]  Welcome to Golden Paradise Hotel. Checking in, please write your name.
[253.38s -> 254.54s]  Mr.
[254.54s -> 260.21s]  Mr. 23-D-C-T-3-4-5-F-G
[272.19s -> 274.99s]  Go back. How do I delete characters?
[279.14s -> 280.66s]  How do I delete this?
[280.66s -> 286.74s]  Mr. How about Mr. Space? Space? Like a ton of spaces.
[287.10s -> 291.77s]  Mr. L
[300.97s -> 312.66s]  Yes, Mr. L, we certainly have your reservation. I'll show you to your room. Please follow me.
[316.23s -> 318.75s]  Let's see if anyone wants to come to the casino with me.
[320.74s -> 322.18s]  How about
[322.18s -> 331.60s]  Cliff, Maria, Isabelle, or Richard? Who wants to go with me to the casino? Richard? How about Richard? Yeah.
[332.56s -> 338.08s]  I have to call him? We're not staying in the same room? Wait, wait, wait, wait. You guys didn't get a fucking suite?
[339.50s -> 340.86s]  Separate rooms?
[340.86s -> 347.38s]  What are you talking about? No, get like a- get like an executive suite. Everybody pull their money together and you get like fucking three bedrooms.
[347.98s -> 352.21s]  Hello, Richard. How about going to the casino with me?
[352.85s -> 355.34s]  Richard, wait for me in the lobby. I'll be right there.
[355.86s -> 361.30s]  All right, here we go. Select game.
[361.46s -> 364.94s]  What do you think we should do first? How about slots? Yeah.
[365.58s -> 372.88s]  All right, $50 slot. How much money do I have? I have $1,000.
[373.48s -> 381.60s]  Okay, that's just $250.
[382.44s -> 390.44s]  I just got something.
[390.84s -> 392.63s]  That's it?
[392.63s -> 402.22s]  $250, let's go. Give me another seven.
[403.02s -> 407.50s]  All right, I'm out. I'm out. Give me up. I'm out. How do I leave?
[408.10s -> 410.10s]  I didn't want to play again. I wanted to know.
[411.42s -> 413.42s]  No, I wanted to get out. I wanted to leave.
[413.82s -> 417.38s]  How do you get out? No, stop putting money into the machine and leave.
[418.18s -> 422.03s]  How can I help you? You got any advice?
[422.83s -> 427.71s]  There's only one way to win a slot machine. Insert a coin, pull a lever. With luck, you'll be a millionaire.
[428.35s -> 430.35s]  I'll be a- I'll be a millionaire?
[430.91s -> 434.38s]  Thanks for the advice.
[434.38s -> 454.40s]  What's that? Oops, all berries.
[455.14s -> 456.66s]  Go on, another orange.
[456.66s -> 460.62s]  That's fucking nothing.
[461.34s -> 469.46s]  Stop, Jeremy. This is my college money. There it is. All right, that's got to be something big.
[471.17s -> 473.22s]  All right, give me up.
[473.22s -> 483.02s]  Uh, I'm done with this one. I lost $400. It's okay. Let's go. We're gonna go. We're doing
[484.45s -> 485.65s]  Blackjack.
[485.65s -> 488.77s]  I actually kind of know how to play craps a little bit. Not really that much, but I know a little bit.
[489.33s -> 491.33s]  Max bet $250 to Blackjack.
[491.57s -> 501.52s]  At the start of this, I'll be a fucking idiot. At least you bet. I want to bet
[505.28s -> 507.39s]  $50.
[507.39s -> 509.23s]  Give me a hand. What do we got?
[509.23s -> 510.51s]  20.
[510.51s -> 511.47s]  Stay.
[511.47s -> 518.16s]  13, 20. This push gets the fuck out of here.
[520.02s -> 524.90s]  No, I'm staying on a 20. Why would he? Why would you? I'm not gonna hit it. I don't care. That's 20.
[525.70s -> 529.39s]  Just can't stay on 20. Why would you? I'm not hitting it. Why would I hit with the- No, what are you crazy?
[530.35s -> 537.89s]  You stand here too.
[541.87s -> 549.44s]  Uh, I've come to the realization the chat does not understand Blackjack. People don't know how to play this game, but don't worry.
[550.16s -> 553.52s]  Um, this is actually how you play Blackjack and you'll get corrected if you ever play.
[554.56s -> 556.72s]  Uh, this is basic strategy Blackjack. That's what it's called.
[557.52s -> 560.24s]  And uh, if the dealer has a four-five or a six,
[561.60s -> 563.76s]  is it- I'm talking to zoomers. Uh, sorry.
[564.64s -> 566.08s]  No, I'm not.
[566.08s -> 572.62s]  Why did you say that? I think I'm not talking to zoom. See, right? Just stand. Just take it. See, that's-
[572.86s -> 574.86s]  That's a 67% chance that he's gonna lose.
[575.34s -> 583.09s]  It's like probably 20 zoomers in this chat. Maybe. The rest of you are fucking doctors and shit.
[583.09s -> 585.09s]  You should know what I'm talking about. $250. Let's go. Big one.
[586.29s -> 590.54s]  It's horrible. All right. Should I split the twos? I guess the 10?
[591.34s -> 592.78s]  What do you think?
[592.78s -> 595.98s]  Split twos against the 10? That would be the worst thing ever.
[596.86s -> 605.12s]  Okay, we're gonna hit.
[605.12s -> 607.12s]  Give me 18.
[607.12s -> 610.80s]  All right, stay on. I have to- I should have hit on that one.
[614.22s -> 617.90s]  Okay, uh, I don't know what happened. 20 fucking one. Give me a break.
[618.78s -> 621.28s]  See, what I did right there is you never do that.
[621.68s -> 626.16s]  Uh, that was the dumbest thing ever. I was doing it for a stream joke and I ended up losing all my money. Big one.
[626.16s -> 627.36s]  Let's go.
[627.36s -> 631.95s]  13 against a five. Don't do anything.
[633.09s -> 636.21s]  If you have a 12 or over, don't do anything.
[637.68s -> 641.44s]  As you see, again, people don't get this. People don't understand.
[642.24s -> 644.88s]  If the deal is showing a five or a six, especially a six,
[646.11s -> 651.31s]  if you have a 12 or more, do not do anything. Stand. Don't hit. Don't be like,
[651.31s -> 653.31s]  well, I would have hit and then you bust and you lose.
[655.12s -> 658.56s]  No, you don't. No, no, you- that- you- this is how you- that's how you play blackjack.
[659.28s -> 663.86s]  Not if your cards count. Well, that person's gonna get thrown out of the casino. Let's fucking split.
[665.54s -> 667.54s]  I have- wait, how much money do I have?
[667.94s -> 677.52s]  I can't- how could I split this? I only had 250. Doesn't make any sense.
[678.56s -> 681.04s]  Let's take a card here.
[681.04s -> 689.55s]  Nope!
[689.55s -> 694.16s]  So, I lost 250.
[695.17s -> 698.61s]  You just did what you said not to do. No, a four, five, or a six.
[699.65s -> 702.02s]  All right, I'm gonna get it all back.
[702.02s -> 711.55s]  Here it is. This is bad. Insurance. No, it's fucking- that is my- that's the blackjack, right?
[712.27s -> 723.18s]  Okay, here we go. Come back. Just count cards. And now I know you guys don't- don't play blackjack.
[723.58s -> 725.98s]  You guys know that most decks have like eight decks.
[726.70s -> 732.54s]  Like between like six and eight decks is what people like to play. Good luck counting fucking like 500 cards.
[733.02s -> 736.38s]  By the way, get out. Kicked out of that- kicked that fucking person out of the casino.
[737.10s -> 746.96s]  All right. So, uh, where's the uh-
[747.28s -> 755.42s]  Where's the ATM? Why did I hit against a 10?
[756.99s -> 759.23s]  Yeah, that's a joke. Okay. That's a funny joke.
[768.34s -> 770.34s]  Uh, Gerber, we've been here for
[770.50s -> 776.58s]  10 minutes and you are- we- you know, we have like, uh, the hotel booked for four days, right?
[778.48s -> 781.44s]  Yeah, I'll just take a walk. I'll just- I'll just take a walk every day.
[782.48s -> 798.93s]  I gotta get that million, man. I think you actually like level up and shit. All right, just don't- no huge bets.
[799.41s -> 812.21s]  Need a new name here.
[812.21s -> 813.65s]  Mr.
[813.65s -> 838.00s]  Not Mr. L. This is- no, Mr. L is- is- Mr. Loss is more like it. No, no, no, no, no. Green. That's me. Greg Green.
[840.78s -> 842.78s]  Mr. Greg Green. God.
[844.46s -> 848.30s]  Let's see if anyone- okay. Richard was a bad- Richard was bad luck. We're gonna bring, uh-
[849.26s -> 851.18s]  Let's go with Maria.
[851.18s -> 853.42s]  Maria- no.
[854.48s -> 863.54s]  Yeah. Greg Green is the greedy Grinner's alter ego.
[864.42s -> 868.77s]  That's me in the lobby. All right. Here we go.
[870.98s -> 874.75s]  Select game. We're gonna do- gonna go to roulette.
[875.47s -> 882.10s]  Okay, no monster bets. Just play it well. What numbers? What am I choosing, guys?
[886.21s -> 888.29s]  All right. Always- always double zero.
[889.33s -> 891.76s]  Double zero. A hundred- no.
[892.08s -> 894.00s]  Twenty dollars on double zero.
[894.00s -> 896.62s]  And then we're gonna do, uh-
[896.86s -> 900.90s]  We're gonna do- can I do like corner bets in this?
[901.70s -> 905.26s]  Can you kind of go right? Okay. And then 13, 14, 16, 17.
[906.14s -> 909.15s]  Hundred bucks on the line. Let's go.
[910.11s -> 918.38s]  How do I say yes go? How do I say yes?
[925.78s -> 934.69s]  Ready. How do I say yes? Okay. Mr. Green, have you finished your bet? Yes, I have.
[935.25s -> 945.34s]  Let's go. Is that four?
[945.90s -> 947.26s]  Four black?
[947.26s -> 956.26s]  Anyway, all right. It's all right. You go- you go with the same strategy.
[957.84s -> 961.76s]  Same strategy right here. 13, 14, 16, 17. Hundred bucks. Get it on there.
[962.32s -> 964.48s]  Double zero. Zero and double zero.
[965.36s -> 967.92s]  Twenty bucks on each one.
[968.16s -> 970.43s]  Go for it. Let's go.
[970.43s -> 972.91s]  Mr. Green? I'm ready. 13, 14, 16, 17. Let's go.
[973.55s -> 981.50s]  The corner somewhere. Right here. 26. All right.
[981.98s -> 989.78s]  Just put one in every spot.
[992.45s -> 994.77s]  Dude, just put like a dollar on every number.
[995.49s -> 1002.29s]  And then just sit there and stare while you don't win or lose anything.
[1003.90s -> 1005.90s]  You just are annoying.
[1010.08s -> 1011.68s]  No, you have to-
[1011.68s -> 1039.01s]  If you did this at the casino, it would be like, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir. Stop, stop, stop.
[1039.81s -> 1042.75s]  What? I just want to make sure I win.
[1050.08s -> 1058.72s]  All right. Mr. Green?
[1058.96s -> 1062.22s]  Are you finished betting?
[1062.22s -> 1064.94s]  Yep. I'm ready. Spin that wheel.
[1074.85s -> 1075.97s]  Did I?
[1075.97s -> 1079.33s]  What? Okay. I was gonna say no way.
[1079.97s -> 1084.83s]  It cost $20.
[1090.10s -> 1092.10s]  Give me that all back. Thank you.
[1092.50s -> 1096.50s]  Now, here's the real fucking play. Mr. Green knows how to play roulette.
[1097.22s -> 1098.66s]  $40
[1098.66s -> 1100.42s]  on half the number.
[1100.42s -> 1102.82s]  And there's a 50-50 chance for you to make it back.
[1103.62s -> 1129.26s]  Now, don't call me Mr. Green for nothing. Spin it. Don't ever doubt Mr. Green.
[1130.22s -> 1135.70s]  And then I do a full cigar in one drag.
[1138.03s -> 1140.03s]  I won $720.
[1140.27s -> 1146.19s]  How's your luck, Fred? Mr. Green? Mine's been awful. Mind if I hang out with you for a while?
[1146.99s -> 1149.68s]  Get out of here, you fucking loser.
[1151.20s -> 1153.20s]  Well, that's okay. I think I'll just try someone else.
[1155.41s -> 1158.66s]  Copy the green strategy. Not on my watch.
[1162.43s -> 1164.43s]  Skip every number. Every other number.
[1164.67s -> 1179.30s]  See, right now there's like a group of like maybe 10 people have uh congregated behind me.
[1181.06s -> 1182.66s]  And like
[1182.66s -> 1187.60s]  I mean, they might be taking pictures of me and shit like like this is this guy's a fucking psycho. You know what I mean?
[1188.64s -> 1190.43s]  All right.
[1190.43s -> 1192.43s]  Hey, and just good luck.
[1195.89s -> 1207.42s]  All right, spin it. And the smoke comes out of my ears.
[1214.72s -> 1219.52s]  Mr. Green, you've won $640.
[1220.48s -> 1230.93s]  Thank you.
[1231.01s -> 1233.01s]  Oh, I can't put it all on red.
[1233.25s -> 1236.72s]  Sorry about that. It's Mr. Green sometimes. I'm out of your drink.
[1243.33s -> 1249.63s]  You know what?
[1249.63s -> 1255.17s]  Take my money somewhere else.
[1255.17s -> 1257.57s]  Let's take this to the slots. No. Blackjack.
[1260.69s -> 1265.17s]  $50 just came in 5,000 bits from Lesbian Bigfoot.
[1266.85s -> 1270.27s]  Thanks for the $50.
[1270.27s -> 1273.87s]  And they say, Jerma, today was my payday, so I thought I'd toss a couple bucks of your way.
[1274.35s -> 1279.23s]  You can use it on a couple more Funkos for your gamer room. Also, I know how much you hate playing Nancy Drew.
[1279.79s -> 1284.43s]  But I've had one request in the world. It would be that you play Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake from the series.
[1285.15s -> 1289.23s]  My sisters and I used to play those games all the time, and watching you play the games you did reminded me
[1289.71s -> 1291.63s]  of the fun we all used to have.
[1291.63s -> 1293.95s]  Thanks as always to the great content, Drew Crew Forever.
[1294.91s -> 1301.79s]  I'm such a w- I'm such a klutz. I sprained my ankle. I hate to ask, but Mr. Green,
[1302.27s -> 1304.27s]  would you please take me to the emergency room?
[1304.99s -> 1316.51s]  Who is the- why? Why me?
[1317.47s -> 1322.70s]  Can you imagine if I'm like a big high roller and I got a big crowd around me?
[1323.58s -> 1326.46s]  Like, wow, Mr. Green, that's another $100. Whoa.
[1327.18s -> 1331.98s]  All right, and like you push through this crowd. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what is it? Yeah, what do you need?
[1332.38s -> 1334.38s]  Can you take me to the ER?
[1335.98s -> 1338.54s]  Can you sub- how many people did you push through?
[1339.66s -> 1347.92s]  And I'll tell you, you got gumption. You got gumption. No one's ever done that before. Get in the car. Let's go.
[1348.80s -> 1356.83s]  No one's ever fucking dressed me that way. Mr. Green took that person to the emergency room.
[1359.89s -> 1364.69s]  What?
[1364.69s -> 1365.89s]  That's it?
[1365.89s -> 1374.27s]  Let's go. 13 versus- yeah, I gotta hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.
[1375.49s -> 1378.70s]  Oh, I gotta hit again.
[1378.70s -> 1381.42s]  Okay, now you stay. He's gonna flip over 10. It don't matter. I lose anyways.
[1382.22s -> 1393.36s]  Oh, yeah. Mr. Green, you're so kind. Accept this gift I won at the slot machine.
[1394.66s -> 1401.42s]  Give me a thousand dollars?
[1401.42s -> 1403.42s]  Let's go. Uh, just spend her money.
[1404.34s -> 1406.34s]  Blackjack. Oh!
[1406.58s -> 1411.95s]  There it is. Blackjack.
[1411.95s -> 1416.27s]  Yeah, 3,500 bucks. Going pretty well. Do it again.
[1418.46s -> 1420.46s]  Nine, give me- oh, come on.
[1420.94s -> 1422.94s]  No, why would I double this?
[1423.10s -> 1425.66s]  Against a nine, that's stupid. Just hit. Take the card. Give me 10.
[1427.10s -> 1429.10s]  All right, I stay.
[1429.34s -> 1438.48s]  Flip over- oh, you motherfucker. Poor shit.
[1439.36s -> 1442.77s]  Remember, this is- we're spending her money right now. Blackjack again.
[1443.41s -> 1446.61s]  13 versus Jack. That sucks. Uh, I'm probably gonna lose.
[1447.98s -> 1449.98s]  Oh, that's even more annoying.
[1451.07s -> 1454.75s]  That's even more annoying that I probably have to take another card, but I can't.
[1455.47s -> 1458.16s]  I can't after three.
[1460.27s -> 1463.47s]  If I take- if you got three small cards like that, what the fuck, man?
[1463.55s -> 1465.55s]  Like eventually, I'm gonna get a monster card.
[1465.79s -> 1468.83s]  How's your luck been, Mr. Green? Mine's been awful. Mind if I hang out with you?
[1472.66s -> 1474.66s]  Yeah, sure. B.F. Bugleberry.
[1475.30s -> 1477.78s]  You can sit right here. You are always welcome.
[1478.50s -> 1487.71s]  Hope I can pick up some pointers.
[1487.71s -> 1494.37s]  You want to bet this? Yes.
[1497.55s -> 1498.51s]  11.
[1498.51s -> 1501.23s]  Ah, versus 10. That's so stupid.
[1502.19s -> 1513.22s]  This is dumb. This would be like a gasp at the table if I doubled down right here. Jesus Christ.
[1520.59s -> 1523.09s]  Well, I hope-
[1523.81s -> 1527.17s]  I hope some of your luck rubbed off on me. See you later.
[1528.05s -> 1535.02s]  I felt a bump when the loser walked past you. Check your pocket. Everything was okay.
[1536.54s -> 1538.54s]  Why is he a loser?
[1538.78s -> 1541.34s]  I didn't call him a loser. The game's calling him a loser.
[1542.46s -> 1549.12s]  Blackjack.
[1549.12s -> 1555.33s]  Ah! Not 20, anyway.
[1562.14s -> 1564.16s]  Mr. Green.
[1564.16s -> 1565.44s]  Mr. Green.
[1565.44s -> 1573.12s]  Your luck didn't rub off. I won $15,000 on that slot machine. I can't forget my lucky charm. I want you to have this
[1574.22s -> 1576.90s]  $5,000.
[1576.90s -> 1579.20s]  Holy shit.
[1579.52s -> 1585.02s]  Some voice. What are you talking about?
[1585.42s -> 1592.59s]  This isn't right. This is wrong. This really isn't my voice. This is my voice.
[1594.29s -> 1609.12s]  All right, dude, I got $8,000 right now. Fuck you. I have to hit again. Oh, that's how you get it done at the table.
[1612.35s -> 1614.66s]  All right, get up. Let's go. Out.
[1614.66s -> 1616.66s]  What do I got? I got fucking 8,500 bucks. Out.
[1625.12s -> 1626.72s]  Game's really loud.
[1626.72s -> 1629.50s]  I can exit the casino.
[1629.50s -> 1631.50s]  Should I go? Well, I'm gonna return to the room.
[1632.06s -> 1639.58s]  Just hang out in the room for a little bit. Go gambling with another friend. Save your scores and
[1640.22s -> 1643.98s]  let's go with another friend.
[1643.98s -> 1645.74s]  Get room service?
[1645.74s -> 1648.42s]  All right, Cliff. Let's go. Let's go, Cliff.
[1649.78s -> 1651.78s]  Keep your 8.5k.
[1654.62s -> 1658.14s]  This is road to a million. Not road to 8.5k.
[1659.66s -> 1670.53s]  Select game. Let's go. All right. Let's do. All right. How do you play poker? Does somebody help me?
[1671.17s -> 1675.84s]  $200 minimum. Maximum. It's easy.
[1676.48s -> 1682.98s]  Everyone's got 10 grand. Anti. 20. Minimum is 20. Maximum is 20.
[1683.62s -> 1685.62s]  Press A button to anti up.
[1685.94s -> 1687.78s]  All right. Anti up.
[1687.78s -> 1694.86s]  So do we all get five cards? This is gonna take forever.
[1697.60s -> 1700.24s]  I got a seven. I got a two. I got hearts.
[1701.12s -> 1703.52s]  At 20. All right. This is what I don't understand about poker.
[1704.40s -> 1706.40s]  This shit here.
[1706.40s -> 1709.60s]  Like bet. Raise. Call. Check. I don't know what that stuff means.
[1712.58s -> 1718.90s]  Um, what does call mean? It's an awful hand.
[1720.94s -> 1722.86s]  Call means like I don't want to raise.
[1724.82s -> 1730.13s]  Hold.
[1730.13s -> 1732.13s]  It means call your mother. It means
[1732.77s -> 1735.89s]  the call means you put the same amount that they did.
[1737.34s -> 1739.74s]  Oh wait, the bugleberry's over there. He's using some of that money.
[1740.54s -> 1748.10s]  It's equal to current bet. Okay.
[1748.74s -> 1754.72s]  Call. Call. Call. Call. Call. So what does check mean?
[1761.81s -> 1763.65s]  No bet. Do nothing.
[1763.65s -> 1768.08s]  Don't bet anything.
[1768.08s -> 1770.24s]  I want to play. I want to participate.
[1770.80s -> 1776.46s]  What's the pot worth?
[1776.46s -> 1780.24s]  This dude's got two fours.
[1781.09s -> 1783.41s]  Hey, we got we got a pair over there.
[1788.56s -> 1794.32s]  Call. Call. Can I? Can I?
[1795.04s -> 1805.26s]  Can I hurry up?
[1805.26s -> 1807.26s]  Wait a minute. I thought you weren't supposed to
[1807.90s -> 1808.94s]  like
[1808.94s -> 1810.94s]  show emotions.
[1811.42s -> 1814.22s]  That's that guy's got like a royal flush.
[1815.42s -> 1828.80s]  This is getting to be five hundred dollars.
[1828.80s -> 1832.03s]  Why don't you guys make me fold? That that that was a chance.
[1836.96s -> 1839.76s]  Is anybody gonna they keep doing this?
[1842.03s -> 1844.03s]  Get a straight straight. Uh, yeah, of course.
[1844.59s -> 1846.27s]  What did he just win?
[1846.27s -> 1850.19s]  He just won 4100 bucks. Ha ha ha. I won. I won. Look at this pot.
[1851.31s -> 1853.31s]  All right. I lost 20 bucks. Let's do it again.
[1854.67s -> 1863.60s]  Anyhow, this game's not even played anymore.
[1864.53s -> 1867.49s]  Yeah, Texas Hold'em is the one that's this at every casino now.
[1869.44s -> 1871.36s]  But this also sucks.
[1871.36s -> 1874.05s]  I'm staying in. I'm just gonna bluff the fuck out of everybody.
[1877.97s -> 1888.02s]  Raise a thousand dollars.
[1888.02s -> 1891.74s]  Raise 200.
[1891.74s -> 1894.62s]  Okay, go ahead and spin it around.
[1894.62s -> 1897.49s]  Yeah.
[1897.49s -> 1899.49s]  All right. What you don't know is I have pocket aces.
[1900.40s -> 1904.40s]  Call. Okay.
[1904.40s -> 1910.99s]  All right. Leave that queen. Oh fuck. That guy's got
[1911.87s -> 1914.94s]  Uh-oh.
[1914.94s -> 1916.78s]  Raise it again.
[1916.78s -> 1918.78s]  Maybe next time I fold.
[1920.64s -> 1922.00s]  Call.
[1922.00s -> 1925.01s]  Look at this dog shit hand.
[1928.99s -> 1930.99s]  I'm I just tried to scare everybody.
[1934.78s -> 1939.18s]  No, he's got I no no no no no that guy probably has like a three of a kind. I'm out.
[1939.90s -> 1943.86s]  This dude's got a three of a kind. He's probably has three jacks.
[1949.42s -> 1951.58s]  Yeah, who knows that guy could have a a flush.
[1952.46s -> 1964.46s]  No, I can't like just pretend. I mean look at he's look at how happy he is again. He's probably got like a
[1965.34s -> 1973.06s]  No, he's back to normal.
[1973.06s -> 1977.98s]  I want to see one of them get excited.
[1978.94s -> 1981.79s]  Raise 100.
[1981.79s -> 1985.14s]  Raise 100.
[1985.14s -> 1988.13s]  Call.
[1988.13s -> 1991.78s]  Call.
[1991.78s -> 1994.59s]  All right. What do you got?
[1994.59s -> 1997.81s]  I got 100. This looks like I want this money.
[1998.53s -> 2008.11s]  He only had two pair. Whatever. Two pair. Two pair. Two pair.
[2008.99s -> 2012.75s]  This is bullshit. I won. Look at this pile of chips and they're mine. Whatever.
[2013.31s -> 2015.01s]  Let's do it again.
[2015.01s -> 2020.54s]  I had shit. Yeah, I keep getting why am I the only person who gets bad cards? Not fair.
[2020.78s -> 2025.34s]  Leave the table. No, no, no, no, no, no, not yet. All right, come on.
[2029.18s -> 2033.98s]  I'm not gonna fold this time.
[2033.98s -> 2041.73s]  Yeah, see you later. Get out.
[2045.44s -> 2056.78s]  Give me another. Give me a jack. That's I could get a flush here.
[2057.58s -> 2063.15s]  Check. What? Yeah, zero. Uh, wait. Hold on. What did I do?
[2063.95s -> 2077.68s]  Call. 50 dollars. Should I call that? Raise 20.
[2080.05s -> 2083.44s]  All right. Call. Call.
[2083.44s -> 2089.76s]  All right. Call. Call.
[2090.24s -> 2094.10s]  Can you just go around the table and just keep saying call, call, call, call until the cards come out?
[2094.66s -> 2096.58s]  Holy shit.
[2096.58s -> 2106.94s]  Get out. Good.
[2107.57s -> 2110.45s]  My secret is to know when to hold them and when to fold them. What about you?
[2112.08s -> 2118.48s]  I can't keep it. I can't keep up now. You can't because they all that's so they all saw the fucking they saw the royal flush.
[2119.04s -> 2121.54s]  That's a 900 dollar.
[2123.97s -> 2128.90s]  Wait, oh.
[2128.90s -> 2135.38s]  All right. Last one.
[2135.38s -> 2137.54s]  900 by the way. Yeah, well they had to take taxes out.
[2141.82s -> 2144.14s]  Got an ace.
[2144.14s -> 2148.64s]  I do have an ace.
[2148.64s -> 2151.68s]  Fold with an ace? No, no. I'm gonna get another ace.
[2153.54s -> 2155.07s]  Raise.
[2155.07s -> 2156.19s]  50 bucks.
[2156.19s -> 2166.88s]  Lower the game audio? I will. After this pan.
[2171.09s -> 2172.13s]  Ace.
[2172.13s -> 2182.14s]  All right, I'm leaving.
[2182.14s -> 2185.54s]  All right. Now we're gonna take this to the slot.
[2187.71s -> 2191.71s]  Well, should I play a crap? I know I have a very very basic understanding of crap.
[2192.35s -> 2197.10s]  How about just leave the table?
[2197.10s -> 2207.57s]  Sit on the toilet.
[2207.57s -> 2214.42s]  Fuck. Leave this casino. Go to a different casino.
[2217.14s -> 2220.34s]  Go to a different casino. All right. I I don't want to see how happy they are that they're winning.
[2221.71s -> 2234.18s]  I want to go.
[2234.18s -> 2236.66s]  Why is it? It's because John he wins every time. Oh, no.
[2237.38s -> 2248.40s]  Carol wasn't all that difficult. Maybe next time I beat you. I'm so sorry to ask you for a favor, but I desperately need some cash.
[2248.88s -> 2255.12s]  Would you like to buy this diamond? I guarantee it is worth quite a bit. It's been appraised for five thousand dollars.
[2255.52s -> 2257.52s]  How much will you give me for it?
[2257.60s -> 2261.38s]  All right, I'll make him an offer.
[2261.38s -> 2263.14s]  Five thousand you say, huh?
[2263.14s -> 2266.70s]  Give you ten dollars to get the fuck away from me and stop talking to me and my friends.
[2268.96s -> 2271.94s]  About four thousand. Ten dollars.
[2272.82s -> 2275.15s]  Maybe you give me a little more. How about thirty six hundred?
[2276.72s -> 2278.22s]  Ten.
[2278.22s -> 2280.22s]  Dollars.
[2280.86s -> 2284.13s]  How about thirty two hundred?
[2284.21s -> 2285.74s]  Ten.
[2285.74s -> 2287.26s]  Fucking.
[2287.26s -> 2288.62s]  Dollars.
[2288.62s -> 2290.99s]  Can you give me a little more? How about twenty eight hundred?
[2292.29s -> 2294.53s]  Ten.
[2294.59s -> 2296.70s]  Dollars.
[2296.70s -> 2298.78s]  Can you give me a little more? How about twenty five hundred?
[2299.98s -> 2301.98s]  You're going to only get
[2302.70s -> 2304.70s]  ten fucking dollars.
[2305.74s -> 2307.74s]  Ah, what a pain.
[2309.34s -> 2322.86s]  God, some people. Let's get out of here. All right, I'm gonna pee. I'll be right back.
[2323.82s -> 2327.79s]  I'm full of piss today. Sorry.
[2329.47s -> 2331.47s]  Oh, mute. Oh.
[2333.82s -> 2335.18s]  See this.
[2335.18s -> 2337.34s]  It is. It is. The music's kind of annoying.
[2338.14s -> 2341.90s]  I'm gonna drop it. Here we go. I don't know if that's any better.
[2345.39s -> 2348.21s]  Better? Is it better?
[2348.21s -> 2390.16s]  I'll be right back.
[2390.16s -> 2454.38s]  Screen is back.
[2454.38s -> 2456.38s]  Uh, exit casino.
[2457.74s -> 2460.58s]  Can you go to different casinos? Is that how this works?
[2463.23s -> 2465.86s]  Exit casino.
[2465.86s -> 2467.87s]  Exit casino.
[2467.87s -> 2471.62s]  Can I go to a different one?
[2471.62s -> 2472.74s]  Oh shit.
[2472.74s -> 2475.94s]  Which casino should we visit? Whoa, the 2020.
[2476.74s -> 2479.57s]  We have to go to the 2020. It's the current year.
[2484.32s -> 2487.12s]  Oh, check it out. This one has a sci-fi atmosphere.
[2488.59s -> 2490.96s]  Yeah, let's go.
[2490.96s -> 2492.96s]  2020. The 2020.
[2495.44s -> 2503.25s]  That's so weird.
[2503.25s -> 2505.49s]  Holy, this music is gonna drive me nuts.
[2506.13s -> 2525.38s]  Oh, no, there's a higher minimum. There's a higher max. Oh, no.
[2527.50s -> 2531.74s]  Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty, five hundred dollars for a spin.
[2534.50s -> 2537.39s]  Come on.
[2537.39s -> 2540.91s]  Oh.
[2540.91s -> 2546.77s]  One more. That's it. I'm done.
[2546.77s -> 2547.65s]  Come on.
[2547.65s -> 2550.64s]  Okay. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
[2556.64s -> 2558.46s]  All right.
[2558.46s -> 2580.54s]  Oh shit. What was that?
[2586.74s -> 2590.13s]  All right. Let's play craps. I know very little of them.
[2590.13s -> 2592.29s]  All right. I'm gonna do a thousand dollar craps. Here we go.
[2592.29s -> 2593.65s]  I'm gonna fucking destroy this.
[2594.21s -> 2597.25s]  So I'm gonna put...
[2597.25s -> 2601.06s]  If I remember how craps works, I'm gonna...
[2601.06s -> 2603.46s]  The whole thing with craps is you don't want to roll a seven.
[2604.18s -> 2607.41s]  I'm gonna put a thousand dollars on the pass line.
[2607.49s -> 2609.01s]  Let's go.
[2609.01s -> 2610.61s]  And then I'm gonna put...
[2611.25s -> 2617.58s]  And these are bets that if this shows up, if you get double sixes, right?
[2618.30s -> 2619.50s]  Then you just get this payout.
[2621.98s -> 2623.50s]  Pass is the best out. Yeah, I know.
[2623.50s -> 2627.26s]  And these are sucker bets. This is 30 to one for snake eyes.
[2627.90s -> 2633.34s]  Can I do a thousand dollar sucker bet and make fucking 30 grand?
[2634.22s -> 2640.77s]  All right. How about 50 dollar sucker bet?
[2640.77s -> 2645.50s]  Looking for two ones.
[2645.50s -> 2646.22s]  All right. I'm good.
[2646.86s -> 2654.80s]  I'm done.
[2654.80s -> 2655.36s]  No seven.
[2656.80s -> 2657.30s]  Six.
[2657.92s -> 2658.88s]  Yeah, there we go.
[2659.44s -> 2661.57s]  Too bad I didn't pay that.
[2662.21s -> 2669.90s]  Yeah, because of the fucking bet over there.
[2669.90s -> 2674.30s]  Okay. Now, if a six shows up...
[2676.26s -> 2676.98s]  Wait, hold on.
[2677.78s -> 2679.42s]  I'm trying to remember how this works.
[2680.30s -> 2683.92s]  All right. Now I want to...
[2683.92s -> 2684.32s]  Now I'm...
[2684.32s -> 2685.92s]  Okay. You're gonna land on a fucking four.
[2686.72s -> 2688.26s]  I can't bet here. Why not?
[2691.52s -> 2692.48s]  Yeah. Okay. I want to...
[2693.76s -> 2696.32s]  500 bucks and you're gonna fucking be hitting fours all day.
[2698.08s -> 2699.92s]  If a six shows before a seven, you win.
[2700.88s -> 2701.68s]  Right.
[2701.68s -> 2702.42s]  Okay. Good.
[2703.04s -> 2706.05s]  I'm gonna throw a four right now.
[2708.54s -> 2709.04s]  Nine.
[2712.22s -> 2713.18s]  Nobody wins. Nobody...
[2713.18s -> 2713.58s]  He's gonna...
[2713.58s -> 2714.46s]  Come on.
[2714.46s -> 2715.18s]  Let's see a four.
[2715.90s -> 2717.73s]  Stay.
[2718.27s -> 2725.47s]  The sucker bet.
[2725.47s -> 2726.99s]  I was gonna put a hundred dollars on that.
[2727.63s -> 2733.70s]  Do that four.
[2734.74s -> 2735.24s]  Six.
[2735.62s -> 2736.42s]  There we go.
[2736.42s -> 2739.39s]  That's it. I win.
[2739.39s -> 2740.19s]  Bingo.
[2740.19s -> 2743.98s]  Thousand bucks.
[2743.98s -> 2744.70s]  Keep going.
[2744.70s -> 2746.94s]  The thing about craps is you can just keep going.
[2750.69s -> 2751.73s]  Thousand bucks on the pass line.
[2757.66s -> 2759.42s]  God damn it. I was gonna do that too.
[2759.42s -> 2761.10s]  I was gonna do one of these moron bets.
[2761.74s -> 2773.38s]  How's your luck been, Mr. Green?
[2773.38s -> 2776.11s]  Mr. Green, how's your luck been?
[2776.11s -> 2777.15s]  Oh, mine's been awful.
[2777.15s -> 2779.97s]  I have $15,000 I want.
[2779.97s -> 2781.17s]  Can I hang out with you again?
[2782.19s -> 2782.69s]  Sure.
[2784.19s -> 2786.27s]  Thank you. I hope I can pick up some more pointers from you.
[2786.27s -> 2787.07s]  I blew it out.
[2787.95s -> 2788.59s]  Hey, sit down.
[2798.32s -> 2798.80s]  No.
[2798.80s -> 2799.76s]  Give me a fucking break.
[2799.76s -> 2800.26s]  Okay.
[2806.66s -> 2813.38s]  Thank God.
[2813.38s -> 2816.02s]  Well, I hope some of your luck rubbed off on me.
[2816.02s -> 2816.82s]  I'll see you later.
[2819.39s -> 2819.89s]  Oof.
[2820.27s -> 2821.79s]  Bugleberry bumps into you as they walk by.
[2821.79s -> 2823.39s]  You check your pockets and everything is fine.
[2824.35s -> 2825.63s]  Go on, Bugleberry.
[2825.63s -> 2827.95s]  Go hit a fucking hundred million dollars.
[2831.17s -> 2831.67s]  Again.
[2836.46s -> 2836.96s]  Yes.
[2846.61s -> 2847.97s]  Don't hit a seven.
[2847.97s -> 2850.61s]  No sevens, no sevens, no sevens.
[2850.61s -> 2854.03s]  Oh, Mr. Green, you'll never believe it.
[2854.03s -> 2856.11s]  Your luck rubbed off on me again.
[2856.11s -> 2859.47s]  I want another $15,000 on a smart machine.
[2860.03s -> 2861.39s]  I can't forget you again.
[2861.39s -> 2863.07s]  I gotta give you five grand again.
[2863.87s -> 2866.11s]  It's $10,000 in two days.
[2867.31s -> 2869.26s]  Hey, thanks for the $5,000.
[2869.26s -> 2869.82s]  And guess what?
[2869.82s -> 2872.54s]  Now I'm back up, oh boy, before I even walked in the fucking door.
[2873.18s -> 2882.11s]  Back to roulette.
[2882.11s -> 2883.79s]  Back to roulette.
[2883.79s -> 2884.43s]  $1,000.
[2884.43s -> 2884.91s]  We're going...
[2886.38s -> 2887.34s]  Okay, this is where we...
[2888.06s -> 2891.41s]  You're gonna think I'm fucking nuts.
[2892.13s -> 2893.65s]  You're gonna think I'm nuts.
[2893.65s -> 2896.69s]  I'm saying $1920, $22, $23, right in the middle.
[2897.25s -> 2898.37s]  $1,000.
[2898.37s -> 2899.09s]  Let it ride, go.
[2915.10s -> 2916.22s]  That was Bugleberry money.
[2916.22s -> 2917.18s]  Who cares?
[2917.18s -> 2919.49s]  That's all right.
[2919.49s -> 2920.45s]  I'm doing it one more time.
[2920.45s -> 2921.49s]  This is Bugleberry money.
[2927.55s -> 2929.07s]  Again, $1920, $22, $23.
[2929.79s -> 2934.29s]  $1920, $22, $23.
[2935.70s -> 2936.20s]  Oh.
[2937.90s -> 2938.40s]  Ah.
[2939.12s -> 2940.24s]  Ah, it was right there.
[2941.70s -> 2942.82s]  Right next to $19.
[2944.00s -> 2944.50s]  Oh.
[2953.73s -> 2955.81s]  $1920, $22, $23.
[2961.79s -> 2963.31s]  $18, you motherfucker.
[2963.31s -> 2964.19s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[2974.22s -> 2976.70s]  $1920, $22, $23.
[2977.50s -> 2979.26s]  If I don't hit, I'm out.
[2979.26s -> 2979.98s]  Back to the slot.
[2988.80s -> 2997.82s]  Right, it lands on the one right next to it.
[2997.82s -> 3000.78s]  Put every cent that I have on $9, $8, and $5.
[3029.52s -> 3030.40s]  Ah, fuck.
[3031.12s -> 3035.12s]  Shit.
[3038.37s -> 3039.17s]  Mr. Green.
[3041.17s -> 3042.13s]  Mr. Green.
[3042.13s -> 3043.73s]  Mr. Green, are you all right?
[3043.81s -> 3046.21s]  Yeah, I'm doing fine.
[3046.21s -> 3049.07s]  Let it roll again.
[3049.79s -> 3052.19s]  And listen, don't ask me how I'm doing after this.
[3052.83s -> 3053.79s]  Just leave me alone.
[3054.82s -> 3056.02s]  And another drink.
[3056.02s -> 3058.02s]  If I could get one, it'd be really good.
[3064.43s -> 3065.39s]  Mr. Green.
[3065.39s -> 3065.89s]  Yep.
[3066.99s -> 3068.19s]  That's a three.
[3068.19s -> 3069.63s]  Yeah, I can read.
[3070.19s -> 3080.13s]  Place your bets.
[3080.13s -> 3081.73s]  I'm telling you, I love this guy.
[3081.73s -> 3082.61s]  There's a guy I watch.
[3082.61s -> 3083.65s]  He's a live streamer.
[3083.65s -> 3085.95s]  He's really, really lucky.
[3085.95s -> 3087.15s]  It has to hit it at some point
[3087.15s -> 3090.40s]  because this guy just makes noises on the internet
[3090.40s -> 3091.84s]  and he's the master fortune.
[3092.80s -> 3095.76s]  He's got to be the luckiest person in the fucking world.
[3095.76s -> 3097.68s]  Mr. Green knows all.
[3111.76s -> 3112.24s]  Fortune.
[3121.66s -> 3123.65s]  What?
[3123.65s -> 3125.97s]  That's four times in a row?
[3133.01s -> 3134.69s]  An alien who's just in here
[3134.69s -> 3137.49s]  and just speared through my chest.
[3138.93s -> 3139.73s]  Fuck, that hurts.
[3143.33s -> 3145.81s]  This is an alien from Aliens Vibes.
[3145.81s -> 3147.65s]  Just boom, bam, through my chest.
[3150.16s -> 3159.92s]  Let's go, 985.
[3159.92s -> 3170.27s]  Oh my god, ace right there.
[3175.62s -> 3176.26s]  God damn it.
[3177.07s -> 3178.59s]  Well, here's my last.
[3178.59s -> 3179.63s]  Hey, Bugleberry.
[3179.63s -> 3181.23s]  Do you need any more luck?
[3181.23s -> 3182.27s]  Where's Bugleberry?
[3182.27s -> 3183.23s]  Can I have some more money?
[3185.63s -> 3186.67s]  He's losing his two.
[3187.39s -> 3188.66s]  All right, everything on four.
[3189.38s -> 3194.67s]  Everything on four.
[3200.82s -> 3201.94s]  Fucking piece of shit.
[3202.50s -> 3223.47s]  Mr. Green, thank you for your stay at the 2020.
[3223.47s -> 3224.19s]  Yep.
[3224.19s -> 3225.89s]  How'd you do?
[3228.34s -> 3228.84s]  Yep.
[3229.71s -> 3230.43s]  Oh.
[3230.43s -> 3230.93s]  Yeah.
[3231.33s -> 3246.80s]  Jerma sucks at this game.
[3247.60s -> 3249.36s]  Jerma sucks at gambling.
[3251.97s -> 3254.61s]  No, I have to, I have to get, I want to be,
[3254.61s -> 3257.41s]  I want to get transferred to the executive suite.
[3257.41s -> 3267.40s]  They're just kept playing half the numbers.
[3268.04s -> 3277.81s]  Mr. Green, you're back.
[3277.81s -> 3278.37s]  I'm back.
[3279.09s -> 3284.61s]  How about Mr. Green's?
[3285.25s -> 3290.13s]  I changed my name to make sure I, yeah, Mr. Green's.
[3293.96s -> 3295.56s]  Stop wasting your money on gambling.
[3297.20s -> 3298.08s]  Tax fraud.
[3299.12s -> 3301.99s]  See, I changed my name every two or three years.
[3301.99s -> 3303.03s]  Just add a couple of letters.
[3303.75s -> 3311.96s]  It makes me able to, hold on, wait, we need,
[3311.96s -> 3312.92s]  why am I talking like this?
[3313.72s -> 3316.36s]  All right, safe plays only.
[3316.36s -> 3317.08s]  We're going to make it.
[3317.08s -> 3330.60s]  I'm going to get, I got across the $10,000 threshold after.
[3330.60s -> 3331.32s]  Different casino.
[3331.96s -> 3335.35s]  You just ruined three people's lives.
[3335.35s -> 3337.59s]  What's another bankrupt person?
[3337.59s -> 3339.91s]  Okay, let's go to the Buffalo Head.
[3340.79s -> 3343.89s]  Let's make a killing in the Old West.
[3344.61s -> 3351.70s]  Easy Godina Crunch is the worst item ever.
[3352.42s -> 3354.02s]  You're just trying to get me to be angry with you?
[3354.66s -> 3355.30s]  Sound weird.
[3356.34s -> 3366.50s]  All right, here we go.
[3366.50s -> 3372.77s]  Face your bets.
[3372.77s -> 3377.20s]  Hey, Mr. Green's, do you remember me?
[3379.44s -> 3382.90s]  Uh, yeah, from poker.
[3382.90s -> 3384.26s]  Your face seems a little familiar.
[3384.90s -> 3387.51s]  I bet you thought you'd never see me again.
[3387.51s -> 3390.39s]  Thank, thanks for being so nice to me.
[3390.39s -> 3391.75s]  I appreciate it so much.
[3391.75s -> 3392.63s]  I'd like to give you that.
[3392.63s -> 3395.19s]  What I've won here tonight is here's $2,000.
[3395.19s -> 3396.79s]  Oh, wait, no, this is the emergency room.
[3398.72s -> 3399.52s]  Oh, nice.
[3400.56s -> 3404.28s]  She knows your identity.
[3405.00s -> 3408.04s]  All right, this is Stephanie money.
[3408.04s -> 3408.68s]  This isn't even mine.
[3409.48s -> 3410.79s]  Bye, Jack.
[3412.42s -> 3412.92s]  Fuck.
[3415.62s -> 3416.18s]  Damn it.
[3416.18s -> 3417.22s]  I had to do it.
[3417.22s -> 3426.68s]  This is Stephanie money.
[3428.18s -> 3428.82s]  14.
[3428.82s -> 3429.46s]  Fuck you.
[3429.46s -> 3430.34s]  Stay on.
[3430.34s -> 3431.06s]  It's just a six.
[3431.06s -> 3432.18s]  It's gonna, you're gonna bust it.
[3432.90s -> 3433.40s]  Boink.
[3434.02s -> 3435.70s]  Oh, you got fucking 21.
[3435.70s -> 3439.14s]  There's like a 10% chance that you would get 21 with a six.
[3440.45s -> 3441.57s]  Unbelievable.
[3441.57s -> 3442.53s]  That's bullshit.
[3442.53s -> 3443.33s]  This is Stephanie money.
[3443.33s -> 3443.83s]  Who cares?
[3445.51s -> 3445.91s]  19.
[3445.91s -> 3446.31s]  There we go.
[3447.99s -> 3451.89s]  All right.
[3453.68s -> 3455.30s]  Good, good.
[3455.30s -> 3456.10s]  All right, do it again.
[3456.74s -> 3460.13s]  Mr. Greens, I'm down on my luck.
[3460.13s -> 3461.97s]  Would you like to purchase my lottery ticket?
[3462.53s -> 3464.05s]  The payoff is $10,000.
[3465.09s -> 3469.44s]  It cost $1,000, but I will sell it to you for $500.
[3474.52s -> 3475.40s]  Yeah, sure.
[3475.40s -> 3476.28s]  This is Stephanie money.
[3476.28s -> 3476.78s]  Who cares?
[3477.48s -> 3478.69s]  Thanks a lot.
[3478.69s -> 3480.05s]  I'm sure that ticket's a winner.
[3480.05s -> 3480.55s]  Good luck.
[3483.72s -> 3484.36s]  What if it is?
[3489.94s -> 3490.44s]  No.
[3490.90s -> 3504.21s]  The winning lottery number is 98985?
[3504.21s -> 3505.57s]  98955.
[3506.05s -> 3507.76s]  You checked your ticket.
[3507.76s -> 3509.28s]  98955.
[3509.28s -> 3511.04s]  I just won $10,000.
[3512.16s -> 3516.79s]  This is Stephanie money.
[3516.79s -> 3517.29s]  Who cares?
[3517.99s -> 3518.95s]  Yes, finally.
[3519.75s -> 3520.63s]  Four versus.
[3520.63s -> 3521.51s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3526.21s -> 3527.09s]  21 again.
[3527.65s -> 3529.41s]  You can't be fucking serious.
[3529.41s -> 3536.93s]  I'm so sorry to ask you for a favor, but I desperately need some cash.
[3537.65s -> 3539.57s]  Would you like to buy this diamond?
[3539.57s -> 3541.41s]  I guarantee it's worth quite a bit.
[3542.21s -> 3544.12s]  How much were you willing to pay for it?
[3544.84s -> 3553.06s]  You know, there was another guy that used to come around here.
[3553.06s -> 3555.22s]  And talk about his diamond.
[3557.19s -> 3565.54s]  I'll give you 100, 100, 100.
[3565.54s -> 3572.18s]  This is fucking Stephanie money.
[3572.18s -> 3572.74s]  Who gives a shit?
[3574.32s -> 3574.82s]  Seven.
[3578.76s -> 3579.80s]  Eighteen.
[3579.80s -> 3580.30s]  Stand.
[3581.40s -> 3583.28s]  I don't do it.
[3594.85s -> 3595.97s]  Fifteen versus six.
[3596.53s -> 3597.41s]  Just fucking stay with this.
[3598.05s -> 3602.13s]  That's fucking unbelievable.
[3602.13s -> 3603.09s]  I hate this.
[3603.09s -> 3603.97s]  I hate this.
[3604.85s -> 3611.16s]  The coward play.
[3611.72s -> 3612.71s]  Whatever.
[3616.92s -> 3618.44s]  What the fuck is happening?
[3619.16s -> 3623.96s]  That's 212121212121.
[3626.92s -> 3633.27s]  Fuck you.
[3633.27s -> 3633.91s]  I have to do it.
[3636.14s -> 3637.12s]  What do you got under there?
[3637.12s -> 3637.62s]  Yeah, of course.
[3638.16s -> 3640.84s]  This table's fucked.
[3640.84s -> 3641.32s]  I'm out.
[3641.32s -> 3643.00s]  This casino I'm out out.
[3643.00s -> 3646.17s]  I'm out of here.
[3647.19s -> 3653.51s]  Maria, let's get the fuck out of here.
[3653.51s -> 3655.03s]  I let's go to another place.
[3655.03s -> 3657.27s]  This place fucking stacks their decks.
[3660.76s -> 3662.36s]  Let's go to the golden parrot.
[3662.36s -> 3663.56s]  No, let's go to the hideaway.
[3664.88s -> 3665.76s]  Hideaway club.
[3667.84s -> 3669.20s]  This place looks pretty run down.
[3669.20s -> 3670.64s]  We should make it our last resort.
[3671.12s -> 3674.77s]  You sure you want to go here?
[3676.92s -> 3678.92s]  Golden paradise, isn't that where I was?
[3679.16s -> 3686.66s]  This one seems okay. Which is the one that I started at?
[3687.76s -> 3697.54s]  Golden Corral? Go to Pasta Italiano.
[3698.10s -> 3702.32s]  All right, here we go. Let's see what I got. Slots.
[3703.12s -> 3710.52s]  What do we got? 50. All right. Now I can't get- I can't damage myself here. Even if I want to do something insane, like for instance.
[3711.60s -> 3713.60s]  Five dollar spins. Look at this.
[3721.05s -> 3723.05s]  How do I increase the bet?
[3723.37s -> 3730.71s]  It's 50 dollars? How do I do it? I want to do- I want to do 50 dollar bet.
[3731.35s -> 3741.27s]  Go back. Did I have to pick it? I had to pick it.
[3742.57s -> 3744.57s]  I need to go to a different machine. Oh.
[3746.26s -> 3748.26s]  Staff are asking for a raise.
[3752.90s -> 3754.89s]  All right, here we go. Let's do it.
[3754.89s -> 3756.97s]  250 a spin. Get a big hit.
[3757.69s -> 3760.38s]  And then I'll- I'll get a million dollars.
[3761.24s -> 3763.72s]  That's a- that's a pretty big hit. That's a million dollars, I think.
[3764.84s -> 3773.30s]  Nice.
[3773.30s -> 3777.83s]  Ah, your staff has died.
[3778.79s -> 3781.35s]  Oh, that game is so fucked up.
[3791.67s -> 3796.63s]  No, I gotta get a good lineup with the 250 dollar bet. It's a terrible payout.
[3797.19s -> 3800.97s]  It's 50 dollars a line.
[3801.05s -> 3806.84s]  And this is the junkie payout? This is a junk payout you're gonna give me for this shit?
[3807.64s -> 3813.40s]  Oh, look at this junk.
[3813.40s -> 3820.78s]  Junkie payout.
[3820.78s -> 3828.70s]  What's that? Relax. This is just Stephanie money.
[3830.18s -> 3831.30s]  Uh,
[3831.30s -> 3832.58s]  not anymore.
[3832.58s -> 3836.10s]  This is Mr. Green money now.
[3840.62s -> 3841.58s]  Come on.
[3841.58s -> 3845.74s]  Say, Mr. Greens, do you remember me?
[3847.75s -> 3848.63s]  Yes.
[3848.63s -> 3854.57s]  I bet you thought you'd never see me again. Thanks for being so nice to me. I appreciate it. So here, here's two thousand dollars. People
[3855.77s -> 3857.77s]  just come up to me and give me money.
[3859.16s -> 3861.16s]  And uh, apparently because I-
[3862.28s -> 3864.28s]  I remember what they look like.
[3865.78s -> 3870.90s]  Hey, Mr. Greens. Yeah, that's me. Remember me? We sat at the same blackjack table for 20 minutes.
[3871.46s -> 3873.14s]  Oh, yeah, I guess we did.
[3873.14s -> 3876.82s]  Yeah, thanks for letting me play blackjack with you, even though that's just what you do at the casino.
[3876.82s -> 3880.50s]  Here's two thousand dollars because you sat next to me and know that- remember what I look like. Yeah.
[3881.38s -> 3893.82s]  This is realistic.
[3893.82s -> 3895.82s]  Casino plants.
[3896.33s -> 3899.21s]  Wait, I just- whoa, whoa. Oh, no, right, right, right, right.
[3904.41s -> 3908.06s]  Give me a big hit.
[3908.06s -> 3911.58s]  How are these coward bets?
[3911.74s -> 3916.15s]  This is 50 dollars a line and you're calling this a- these a coward bets?
[3921.05s -> 3923.05s]  Orange. Now that's gonna be big.
[3923.54s -> 3925.22s]  Now that's gonna be good.
[3925.22s -> 3930.42s]  That's not good at all. Can I see the- um, let me see, please.
[3931.22s -> 3939.94s]  Holy shit, this really is the worst machine ever. Um, okay.
[3945.72s -> 3955.21s]  Seven. I'm taking it down to- if I go under ten thousand, I'm fucking out of here. Watermelon. Oh.
[3961.30s -> 3963.30s]  Ten dollars for a bag of cheetos.
[3964.00s -> 3969.38s]  Watermelon. Shit.
[3969.40s -> 3974.68s]  Go big or go jump king. It's an interesting one to hear.
[3975.80s -> 3977.80s]  Go big or go jump king.
[3983.75s -> 3986.02s]  Ah, shit.
[3986.02s -> 3988.66s]  All right, this is it. This is it. Nine, nine, nine, nine.
[3989.38s -> 4002.57s]  Let's go win it. Can I give you a lottery ticket? No, I don't want anybody's lottery tickets.
[4009.34s -> 4011.34s]  Under- okay, now I'm under ten thousand.
[4018.28s -> 4020.28s]  Hey. Hey, say Mr. Greens.
[4020.84s -> 4023.00s]  Do you remember me?
[4023.00s -> 4027.32s]  Yes. Um, you just walked over here, but at half an hour-
[4027.88s -> 4032.28s]  You're the girl who gave me two thousand dollars for remembering what you looked like. Yeah, I remember you.
[4033.16s -> 4035.96s]  I bet you thought you'd never see me again. Thanks for being so nice to me.
[4036.68s -> 4040.12s]  I appreciate it. So I want to give back. Here's another two thousand dollars.
[4041.91s -> 4044.14s]  Thanks.
[4044.14s -> 4049.66s]  I know who you are. Remember that. I know what you look like if you ever want to give any money to people.
[4050.06s -> 4051.74s]  I know who you are.
[4051.74s -> 4055.50s]  You're the two thousand dollar girl. Come on back if- I don't know. I remember.
[4063.10s -> 4065.10s]  Nobody else will though. Nobody else. Come to me.
[4065.82s -> 4067.98s]  People have shit memories nowadays. Come to me.
[4068.78s -> 4073.30s]  This feels like a weird-
[4073.30s -> 4080.28s]  Uh, like-
[4081.16s -> 4083.80s]  It's a- it's a- it's a simp?
[4087.11s -> 4088.98s]  Watermelon.
[4088.98s -> 4095.75s]  But no-
[4095.75s -> 4098.54s]  Come on.
[4098.54s -> 4101.18s]  German, no. Shut up. I- what do you want me to say?
[4101.90s -> 4104.41s]  I'm just reading.
[4104.41s -> 4117.56s]  That's a big one. Give me a monster hit.
[4118.87s -> 4120.87s]  I mean an absolute fucking
[4121.41s -> 4128.65s]  monster of a hit.
[4128.65s -> 4130.66s]  You're the screamer.
[4130.66s -> 4131.70s]  Oh.
[4131.70s -> 4133.70s]  There it is. Monster fucking hit.
[4133.94s -> 4135.46s]  Monster hit.
[4135.46s -> 4137.46s]  You all didn't believe in me.
[4137.46s -> 4140.02s]  You didn't believe in my monstrous ability.
[4140.74s -> 4142.50s]  That's probably 20 grand.
[4142.50s -> 4152.22s]  Look at this. Oh, it's not 20 grand. It's a lot though.
[4152.94s -> 4157.50s]  All right, that's it.
[4157.50s -> 4166.14s]  Far. Now stop. Not yet.
[4166.30s -> 4172.65s]  Just- I- I- if I go under 16, how do you give yourself a new ceiling?
[4173.27s -> 4174.97s]  16 is the ceiling.
[4174.97s -> 4180.07s]  If I go under 16, we're out.
[4180.71s -> 4182.95s]  Okay, now we make it- we're gonna make a new ceiling?
[4183.75s -> 4185.78s]  Okay.
[4185.78s -> 4187.78s]  Under 16, 5, we're out.
[4188.02s -> 4195.22s]  Bingo.
[4195.22s -> 4206.68s]  Under 17, we're out.
[4206.68s -> 4207.88s]  Okay.
[4207.88s -> 4209.16s]  Same plan.
[4209.16s -> 4213.86s]  I'm gonna stop right now. This is not real. It's not my money. It's not real money.
[4216.73s -> 4220.18s]  Under 17, we're up.
[4220.18s -> 4221.54s]  What if it was?
[4221.54s -> 4223.61s]  We fucked up.
[4223.61s -> 4224.97s]  All right. This is it.
[4224.97s -> 4226.97s]  I got one more after this potentially.
[4231.08s -> 4232.12s]  Okay.
[4232.12s -> 4238.17s]  If I don't hit, we're up. Because we're under 17, fuck.
[4245.61s -> 4247.77s]  See?
[4247.77s -> 4249.77s]  8,500 fucking bucks.
[4249.77s -> 4255.02s]  Stop. You're gambling your net worth.
[4255.66s -> 4259.53s]  All right. Now let's go to the- let's go to the nice casino.
[4260.09s -> 4264.12s]  I want to go to the one that has like $5,000 bets.
[4264.84s -> 4272.71s]  All right. Uh, Richard, come on with us.
[4273.43s -> 4277.16s]  Go to the shitty one. I'm not- you- why- are you kidding me?
[4278.12s -> 4280.42s]  You want me to bring
[4281.52s -> 4282.74s]  $17,000
[4282.74s -> 4285.86s]  into a casino that's supposed to be like a bad casino?
[4286.66s -> 4294.46s]  Oh, this looks really really bad. This is pretty shady. We shouldn't go here. Oh, no, no, no, excuse me.
[4294.78s -> 4298.46s]  All right, don't worry. Let me just take $17,000 in cash with me in here.
[4299.26s -> 4308.09s]  I'm Mr. Greens.
[4308.09s -> 4310.09s]  It's only 17k.
[4310.25s -> 4314.44s]  All right, let's go to- I don't want to go there with that much money.
[4315.34s -> 4317.34s]  Let's- we got to go to the big casino.
[4317.82s -> 4322.42s]  I can't go to Laurel Palace yet. 2020 is the one that is
[4323.06s -> 4324.26s]  big bets.
[4324.26s -> 4334.49s]  I'm ready.
[4334.49s -> 4336.49s]  Here we go. 2020, baby.
[4341.02s -> 4341.98s]  All right.
[4341.98s -> 4343.27s]  Here we go.
[4343.27s -> 4348.12s]  Back to Blackjack.
[4348.12s -> 4350.12s]  Thousand dollars a hand. Let's go.
[4350.20s -> 4355.86s]  Let's go. I'm fucking- I'm bringing this down to ten. I got a $7,500 bankroll.
[4363.90s -> 4366.06s]  Shit. Bad start. That's a bad start.
[4366.86s -> 4368.87s]  Fuck you.
[4368.87s -> 4379.88s]  Fuck. Mr. Greens, I found this wallet with a thousand dollars in it.
[4381.02s -> 4385.34s]  You fucking idiot. That's just the money I put on the table. I was about to place it and I dropped it.
[4385.34s -> 4387.58s]  What are you, dub? I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
[4388.46s -> 4392.38s]  Uh, turn it in. It's a thousand dollars. It means fuck. That's nothing to Mr. Greens.
[4393.74s -> 4395.26s]  Turn it in.
[4395.26s -> 4400.38s]  I'm so glad you found it. That's mine.
[4402.38s -> 4403.90s]  Stay.
[4403.90s -> 4406.81s]  Wow, you found a wallet. I've been looking for that. Thanks.
[4407.53s -> 4413.35s]  Double the bet? You can't double-
[4413.67s -> 4415.78s]  Why would you do that?
[4415.78s -> 4418.82s]  Mr. Greens, the hotel office said you turned in my wallet. Thanks.
[4419.22s -> 4425.54s]  I played roulette and put all the money on my favorite number and won. I would like to reward your honesty.
[4426.10s -> 4430.26s]  If you weren't so honest, I wouldn't have won. So I'm giving you half of my winnings.
[4431.85s -> 4434.10s]  Wait.
[4434.10s -> 4436.82s]  Is that just how- that's- that's just my money.
[4438.07s -> 4440.79s]  You gave me 17.5? I had 17.5.
[4443.40s -> 4444.84s]  Oh my god.
[4444.84s -> 4446.84s]  Okay, I got 34,000 dollars.
[4454.09s -> 4457.05s]  That's a 20 versus six. Why can't I split them?
[4458.94s -> 4462.86s]  I wish I could split these. Why? I can't- I got- because it's not the same damn thing. Whatever.
[4463.42s -> 4481.99s]  Look at how well I did.
[4481.99s -> 4485.35s]  You know, it's bad when you're playing a game, a casino game,
[4486.60s -> 4490.60s]  and the amount of, you know, your net winnings so far are probably
[4491.40s -> 4494.44s]  maybe like positive four or five hundred dollars at this point.
[4495.48s -> 4501.40s]  But the amount of charitable donations to my bankroll has been upwards of 50,000 dollars.
[4502.15s -> 4511.59s]  That's kind of a strange casino game. My profit is just donations.
[4514.90s -> 4516.02s]  Come on.
[4516.02s -> 4518.02s]  Something- why? Two aces.
[4518.74s -> 4520.55s]  This is so dumb.
[4520.55s -> 4524.33s]  Ah!
[4524.33s -> 4526.33s]  Just like in real life.
[4527.34s -> 4530.38s]  He's a streamer at heart. These are all bits.
[4531.90s -> 4534.97s]  There's a blackjack finally.
[4535.05s -> 4537.05s]  Life imitates art.
[4537.05s -> 4550.22s]  Another blackjack. Two in a row. I got 30 grand. When do I- oh, why?
[4550.78s -> 4556.22s]  When do I unlock the- the expensive casino? I have 35,000 dollars. Do I need to go- it's six figures?
[4556.54s -> 4561.18s]  The only way that's gonna happen is if somebody loses another wallet.
[4574.57s -> 4576.33s]  Ah!
[4576.33s -> 4587.14s]  That's so bad. The link? Link, link. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I just clicked a stay.
[4587.78s -> 4595.67s]  Holy fuck. I didn't even mean to do that. I can't believe that just happened.
[4596.97s -> 4598.97s]  All right, click the link. Click the link. Hold on.
[4600.17s -> 4607.26s]  Where's this link? Is it on screen?
[4608.38s -> 4617.43s]  I don't- who-
[4617.43s -> 4621.80s]  What is this?
[4621.80s -> 4623.08s]  Who is that?
[4623.08s -> 4625.42s]  Who is that?
[4625.42s -> 4632.12s]  Is that a- is that a- wait, is that a per- is that- that's a person. Mr. Green and Bugleberry?
[4650.76s -> 4653.32s]  I don't- but that's like a per- that's a real person.
[4662.52s -> 4672.28s]  Bugleberry.
[4672.28s -> 4687.54s]  Do it again. Give me a blackjack. Four, five, six, man.
[4693.29s -> 4694.92s]  Howard.
[4694.92s -> 4703.38s]  Howard is not how you win in a casino game. I mean this- that is how you win. What am I talking about? Yes.
[4707.91s -> 4710.76s]  Even.
[4710.76s -> 4712.76s]  Okay, sure. Could you put
[4713.38s -> 4718.20s]  $20,000 on the table right now and hit blackjack and have like 80 grand in your pocket? Sure.
[4719.24s -> 4722.84s]  Um, or you just don't win that hand and then the re- all your money's gone.
[4724.33s -> 4730.57s]  Rather than just bleeding 500 to a thousand dollars like I'm doing here over the course of like seven hours.
[4733.08s -> 4735.80s]  I'm not doing this because that ends everything now.
[4736.44s -> 4740.79s]  I'll do this
[4740.79s -> 4742.79s]  over the course of a few hours.
[4743.77s -> 4746.81s]  And then look, you lost 30 grand. I only lost 100.
[4747.45s -> 4760.95s]  Insurance? No.
[4760.95s -> 4762.15s]  Turd grand.
[4762.15s -> 4765.22s]  It's just virtual. I- look, are you kidding me?
[4765.78s -> 4767.78s]  Do you really think the guy with no self-control
[4768.26s -> 4773.94s]  if- if I was able to like legally at this table that I wouldn't do this three times? Are you kidding me?
[4774.82s -> 4776.82s]  You know, you- you're on- what channel you're on, right?
[4781.64s -> 4792.36s]  There you go. This is blackjack. I want to be able to bet $10,000 a hand. That's what you don't understand. That's double blackjack.
[4798.17s -> 4800.92s]  All right. Oh, we've crossed.
[4804.44s -> 4807.50s]  17 versus a nine. I hate this but I'm gonna do it.
[4808.30s -> 4824.15s]  Don't let him. He could have just won so much. Yeah, but I- it's not allowed. The max bet is 10- is a thousand.
[4824.71s -> 4826.71s]  I'm max betting right now.
[4833.43s -> 4837.45s]  Go all in. I would if I could. You know, I would. I would do a
[4838.39s -> 4840.39s]  $35,499 bet now.
[4840.89s -> 4849.75s]  See if I can break 40. Give me blackjack again. All right, let's split him up.
[4850.39s -> 4852.39s]  Here we go. This is it. Split him.
[4853.56s -> 4859.19s]  18 and 20. Stay on both of them. Stay on both.
[4863.30s -> 4865.62s]  Get the hell out of here. Yep. That's a double.
[4866.48s -> 4868.34s]  2,000 fucking bucks.
[4868.34s -> 4872.15s]  Okay. Now-
[4872.15s -> 4877.69s]  Mr. Greens, my little girl is very sick and needs an operation. We're too poor.
[4877.77s -> 4881.05s]  I know we just met but could you please lend me a hundred dollars?
[4887.20s -> 4892.26s]  Absolutely. Thank you so much. I'll come back in about two or three hands with 50 grand.
[4893.06s -> 4896.42s]  Bye!
[4896.50s -> 4898.50s]  Do you- do you wish to come back?
[4899.58s -> 4901.58s]  Remember me? I know your face.
[4918.94s -> 4922.70s]  Mr. Greens, you've saved the life of my baby. Here's two hundred dollars.
[4924.41s -> 4927.35s]  Oh. Two hundred?
[4932.34s -> 4934.30s]  I-
[4934.30s -> 4938.07s]  Uh, not more than that. Uh, I mean,
[4938.81s -> 4940.81s]  I had a guy sit next to me
[4941.21s -> 4944.49s]  and he sat behind me for a few hands and gave me five grand.
[4945.90s -> 4950.46s]  And then a lady came up and asked me if I remembered what she looked like twice and I got four grand.
[4952.04s -> 4956.04s]  Okay, I just saved your daughter's life and I only got a hundred dollars.
[4956.60s -> 4961.42s]  What is this?
[4961.42s -> 4963.26s]  Are you fucking serious?
[4963.26s -> 4975.85s]  And then just a huge- another huge inhale and I'm holding it in.
[4976.98s -> 4980.34s]  Where is it? Where is it? Where's that- where's the smoke? He has to breathe the smoke out eventually.
[4980.82s -> 4984.02s]  And then like a little trail of smoke is coming up from behind me.
[4986.09s -> 4993.80s]  And then I just stare and I go, you know where that's coming from. And then everybody's like what the- this guy's- fuck!
[4994.20s -> 5013.43s]  I can't wait till you get old. What? You think I'm gonna be like this?
[5018.62s -> 5020.54s]  You know what? I'm gonna get insurance because fuck it.
[5022.62s -> 5024.62s]  God damn it. And one time I do-
[5028.52s -> 5036.34s]  The one time I- oh my god, whatever. Grymer's teeth are gonna be brown.
[5039.99s -> 5041.99s]  Wait, why do I have brown teeth?
[5049.85s -> 5052.34s]  Damn it. All right. I'm getting up. I'm going.
[5056.01s -> 5058.01s]  Too much CBT oil?
[5058.01s -> 5061.42s]  I'm getting up. Okay, quick quick quick quick.
[5064.66s -> 5067.56s]  Okay.
[5067.56s -> 5069.64s]  I'm doing poker. I need your help here.
[5070.36s -> 5074.01s]  I'm doing a thousand dollars on poker.
[5074.41s -> 5091.74s]  I need you guys help. The ante's a hundred bucks. Let's go. Seven- seven cards start his ass.
[5093.24s -> 5095.24s]  Did I just combine two messages in a row?
[5097.14s -> 5099.62s]  Stefan, you got- all right. I'm ready. Double Stefan. We're ready to go.
[5100.73s -> 5102.73s]  Go all in. A hundred- a thousand dollars.
[5106.74s -> 5108.74s]  Raise 500. Sure. I'll do that too.
[5109.59s -> 5112.23s]  Hey, I'm gonna raise it a thousand dollars.
[5115.26s -> 5118.70s]  Who's this guy?
[5118.70s -> 5119.74s]  Wait.
[5119.74s -> 5122.38s]  Who's the guy with like the- the cyborg face?
[5124.49s -> 5126.57s]  This is a fifty one hundred dollar pot right now.
[5127.29s -> 5128.33s]  Paul.
[5128.33s -> 5130.65s]  Paul.
[5130.65s -> 5134.15s]  Give me another seven.
[5134.15s -> 5136.31s]  Shit. Oh no. All right.
[5137.03s -> 5141.86s]  Okay, let's keep going. He doesn't get shit over there. We got a pair of fours. Dickhead.
[5146.44s -> 5148.44s]  Paul. Paul. Paul. Yeah, you got a pair of fours.
[5149.00s -> 5150.20s]  Dickhead.
[5150.20s -> 5159.54s]  Seven, eight, nine.
[5159.54s -> 5164.17s]  He's from the future. The year 2020.
[5164.81s -> 5171.00s]  He folded. That was the guy I was worried about. Wait. You got two aces.
[5171.88s -> 5173.88s]  Oh shit. You have two aces.
[5183.85s -> 5188.12s]  What an idiot. Holy shit. Did it work? He's got twos.
[5191.77s -> 5197.34s]  Fuck.

[5226.49s -> 5229.34s]  I got two pair though.
[5229.34s -> 5232.46s]  Holy shit. I'm gonna win ten thousand more dollars. All right. Raise it all in.
[5233.02s -> 5235.02s]  This is seven. I got a pair of threes and sevens.
[5235.42s -> 5249.13s]  Let's scare the shit out of him. Are you still- are you still at the table?
[5249.61s -> 5253.14s]  Are you still at the table? Okay. You still want to go, huh? You want to go?
[5254.10s -> 5256.74s]  You got any more money? You got a thousand more dollars to put on this?
[5257.90s -> 5259.90s]  Okay. All right. You want to play games?
[5260.70s -> 5288.95s]  That's one of- that's a scenario where you- you're like at the table
[5289.67s -> 5291.67s]  and you just like sit up. You stand up and you like
[5292.97s -> 5295.61s]  point like once just at the sky and you go, ah,
[5297.62s -> 5299.62s]  ah, um, good luck.
[5300.02s -> 5301.54s]  Good luck everybody. Good luck everybody.
[5301.54s -> 5302.50s]  I wish everybody good luck.
[5302.50s -> 5307.46s]  And then you fucking just walk away and you walk with your hands in your pockets and you're just like one, two, three, four, five, six, count my steps.
[5308.34s -> 5310.34s]  Okay, I gotta take a piss. Let's pee.
[5315.38s -> 5322.33s]  Okay, then you're fine. Just go
[5323.77s -> 5332.84s]  It's all right. Say fuck. Fuck. Let's hope. Ah, it's okay. All right. Let's go. Let's go to the buffet.
[5333.24s -> 5344.46s]  Oh my god, what's happening? Thirty one thousand five hundred dollars on one?
[5345.02s -> 5355.61s]  Okay. Wait, what just happened? I can't do that. Stop doing that. I'm trying to-
[5358.14s -> 5366.07s]  Why is it doing this?
[5366.15s -> 5369.67s]  Oh, I have to- minimum bet is a hundred. Oh shit.
[5370.65s -> 5372.97s]  Okay, we're gonna do one, two, three, four, five.
[5385.37s -> 5404.58s]  Six, seven, eight, nine. I'm ready. This song.
[5414.12s -> 5432.95s]  Is that a color? I thought I was a coward. Just bet one through twelve, but you don't get the same payback.
[5432.95s -> 5441.38s]  It's thirty five and one. I said the word thirty five and it landed on it. Great.
[5441.94s -> 5450.12s]  I'm pro- how am I- I'm this- I'm pro- look, this is not even my money. Somebody gave this to me.
[5450.52s -> 5473.80s]  And I'll bet my age. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[5474.36s -> 5483.16s]  Thirty four. Why didn't I just do my fake age that I said that I am? I'm thirty three.
[5483.88s -> 5489.29s]  Now, how old are you? Ah, thirty three. All right, now thirty five.
[5490.01s -> 5508.90s]  I'm just on a fake age. God damn it. Do your real age. I'm not actually thirty five, but okay.
[5509.78s -> 5524.20s]  Let's see if it works. God damn it. I should have done how old people say that I look.
[5524.20s -> 5528.12s]  It's not about the age that you actually are. The age that you pre- it's the how- it's how you feel.
[5529.08s -> 5546.74s]  People think I'm twenty five, twenty four. Fuck. All right, now I'm gonna- it's now- it's gonna be
[5548.10s -> 5557.74s]  the age that I wish that I was. The age that I wish that I just still was. Twenty eight's great.
[5557.74s -> 5562.39s]  You know, it's like twenty eight. You're older, but you're not old. That's the age I wish I could
[5562.39s -> 5598.17s]  stay for. All right, fuck the whole twenties. Twenty- we'll start at twenty one. The twenties
[5598.17s -> 5605.64s]  are gone, guys. I don't have them anymore. I'm now in my thirties. Well, dude, we'll do my entire
[5605.64s -> 5619.19s]  demographic. Wait, how many is that? Okay, now this is like how old- I'm wrong. All right,
[5619.19s -> 5623.03s]  all right. I'll do the range. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. You're not gonna complain. You're not
[5623.03s -> 5628.71s]  twenty one. You're not even that same range, old boomer. I'm gonna say shut up. I'm gonna say shut up.
[5636.55s -> 5644.79s]  Okay, there you go. Twenty six. Twenty six to thirty five is like my age kind of range.
[5645.75s -> 5665.94s]  God damn it. I should have bet on the fucking median age of the audience. Not about how old I
[5665.94s -> 5691.38s]  am. I keep getting this wrong. The age that we act. There's the thing. Here's the thing. All right,
[5691.38s -> 5699.10s]  well, let's be- okay, here we go. Here's my- how I act. Not how you act. How I act. Okay,
[5711.24s -> 5719.46s]  I think that's pretty good. Let's go. All in on eleven.
[5719.54s -> 5734.62s]  The gods wanted my real age again. I act thirty-four apparently. It's how thirty-four
[5734.62s -> 5771.03s]  year olds act. Okay, uh, a thousand dollars on one. All right, if you come over to a table
[5772.23s -> 5784.66s]  and- hold on, this is important. Let me- how do I- let me get out with this. Where's my camera?
[5785.38s -> 5794.42s]  I'm gonna show you what you do. Here's- here's how this plays out. If you ever come up to a table,
[5794.42s -> 5799.06s]  okay, and you put a thousand- here's how you're gonna- it's how you're gonna act. Wait a minute,
[5799.06s -> 5811.45s]  hold on. Dougalberry again. I'm such a klutz. I- I'm such a klutz. I sprained my ankle,
[5811.45s -> 5815.98s]  and I hate to ask, but Mr. Green, would you please take me to the emergency room?
[5819.46s -> 5825.70s]  Yeah, let's go. Hey, thanks for the free money. Mr. Green's took that person to the emergency room.
[5826.66s -> 5833.21s]  Okay, here we go. We're gonna put a thousand dollars on, uh, twenty. This is what- if you put
[5833.21s -> 5835.85s]  that much money on a number, you're gonna go up to the table, and you're gonna go like this.
[5863.29s -> 5902.92s]  Hey, who's back? Let's go. Thousand dollars on 13, 14 in the corner. 13, 14, 15, 7. What was it?
[5902.92s -> 5925.06s]  It's gonna be impossible. The numbers are too close together. Okay, literally how this is going to
[5925.06s -> 5929.94s]  work is I- the first- the first number that I see in chat is again a thousand dollars on it.
[5929.94s -> 5955.29s]  There's 10. Got it wrong. Boring number. Omega lol. What? Ban that person. Okay, yeah. Time that
[5955.29s -> 5972.82s]  person up. Time that person up for fucking five minutes. Okay, um, okay. I'm gonna pick a number,
[5972.82s -> 5979.91s]  and I'm gonna say your name. Uh, jbumbum. jbumbum. Twenty-three thousand dollars on it. If this
[5979.91s -> 6007.06s]  doesn't hit, ban that person for ten minutes. Uh, gun gun guy said 36. Gun gun guy. Hold on.
[6007.06s -> 6025.10s]  Blown all of my money. I even spent my return fare home. Can you spare two hundred dollars
[6025.10s -> 6036.74s]  for this watch? Yeah, sure. Thank you for saving. Well, all right, what was that guy's name? Uh,
[6036.74s -> 6043.19s]  gun gun? Gun guy, whatever his name was. Okay, thousand dollars here. What's wrong? Time amount.

[6063.74s -> 6072.73s]  hit. You just said number. Uh, skeletoxin says 14. That's a nice watch. You want to sell it for
[6072.73s -> 6085.05s]  a thousand dollars? Yeah. Thirteen? Wait, what is it? Fourteen? What was their name? I don't even
[6085.05s -> 6094.57s]  remember. Wait, I didn't put a bet down. If this is actually 14, don't even. I don't think. Thank
[6094.57s -> 6099.34s]  God. I didn't put the bet down, but they were wrong. Ban them anyways. All right, what are we
[6099.34s -> 6130.70s]  doing? 26. All right, the true Mechi. 26. Ban them for 10 minutes if this is wrong. Oh, 27 to 26.
[6131.58s -> 6140.62s]  So close, but it's still a 10 minute time up. Goodbye. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

[6166.76s -> 6182.86s]  Ban me- who said that? I said ban me 12. Ban me 12. Okay, ban them first. I'm gonna do 12. Do 20
[6182.86s -> 6207.13s]  minutes if this is wrong. 35 keeps popping up. Let's just put- I'm gonna- okay, I'm gonna put

[6300.82s -> 6411.80s]  I will mute for five- I'll mute for five minutes. Ah! That's fucking ridiculous. I know I'm banned.
[6411.80s -> 6415.40s]  Ban me again. Fucking whatever. I'm saying my piece. That's ridiculous. I didn't get the
[6415.40s -> 6419.78s]  last two. Whatever. It's been five minutes. Whatever. Fuck it. Here's what do you got.
[6420.34s -> 6427.56s]  Uh, it's one- 10 grand. Somebody said move on. What do you mean move on? I got 22 grand still.
[6427.56s -> 6450.14s]  This is not even my money. Six or mod me. Okay. Who said that? Wait, this- this is or mod me? What
[6450.14s -> 6466.73s]  do you mean? Six means if you- lands on six then you get mod. Yeah, you were wrong. No, no, it was
[6466.73s -> 6471.45s]  if they got- no, it's not mod me. No, they- if they have it hit, yeah, then you deserved it.
[6479.69s -> 6487.69s]  Game's muted. Oh, fuck. Seven or I eat eggs. Whoever said that. Seven or they- oh, they eat eggs.
[6488.49s -> 6503.62s]  Well, yeah, and you're gonna get timed out for 10 minutes. Ooh, that was close. That was close.
[6503.62s -> 6511.46s]  That was pretty close. All right, let's go burn the rest of this. Let's go. Ready? You know what
[6511.46s -> 6516.90s]  I'm going- you know what I'm doing here. This is what we're doing. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's
[6516.90s -> 6538.73s]  fucking go. Let's go. We're going super mode. $2,500 a spin. Let's go. Go broke.
[6543.00s -> 6557.70s]  Come on. It's gotta get one fucking monster hit. Oh, come on. I gotta do it. Come on. Where's the
[6557.70s -> 6576.42s]  monster hits? Derma sucks thanks for five community subs. God damn it. Seven. Seven.
[6580.90s -> 6591.48s]  I just won. That's like a hundred thousand dollars I win. Get the fuck out of here.
[6591.48s -> 6594.52s]  None of you believed in me. None of you believed in Mr. Green.
[6597.50s -> 6602.46s]  Is there anything even left on this? I just put it in my mouth and breathe it in just to make you feel
[6604.17s -> 6620.46s]  less than me. You see? This cigar cost $2,500. I got $110,000 fucking dollars. Yeah. Did I beat the
[6620.46s -> 6627.51s]  game? Mr. Greens, I've got great news for you. Due to your great success, you have been awarded
[6627.51s -> 6634.47s]  a high roller status and with it a complimentary room at the Laurel Palace. The Laurel Palace?
[6635.19s -> 6640.65s]  We could never go there before. Good going, Mr. Greens. Go pack your bags. Our limo is waiting
[6640.73s -> 6648.81s]  to take you to Laurel Palace. Oh, that's right. Where I belong with all the other rich people.
[6649.85s -> 6653.96s]  A high roller. I'll miss this old room, but not too much.
[6654.92s -> 6658.12s]  Well, I hope my limo is ready. Now it's off to the Laurel Palace.
[6658.68s -> 6665.22s]  That's my internal monologue. My internal monologue, I still think I'm a good person
[6665.22s -> 6670.68s]  and I talk normally, but I'm actually horrible. But I like to pretend I am in my head.
[6671.80s -> 6686.20s]  Welcome to the Laurel Palace. Wow. Check it out. A great room and free to boot. Well,
[6686.20s -> 6692.36s]  time to go back. Get back to the casino floor. And there'll be no stopping me till I reach $10
[6692.36s -> 6701.45s]  million. That's, uh, if you, if you go to the casino, going there with the goal to
[6701.45s -> 6710.57s]  come up with $10 million, um, what you should be trying to do is to be able to still afford to go
[6710.57s -> 6717.46s]  to Taco Bell when it's all over. So I think you're going in with weird expectations here.
[6724.74s -> 6736.52s]  Holy shit. Look at this place. Wow. Like games. Let's do, how, what's the slot like? Oh, that's
[6736.52s -> 6757.70s]  a $5,000 bid. Oh, that's a lot of money. Oh no. I'm about to lose. I'm about to lose a comma.
[6758.50s -> 6770.55s]  Come on, keep it up. Okay. Is it weird that I feel like if you're sitting at a,
[6771.03s -> 6778.15s]  if you're here doing a $5,000 a spin slot machine, you are like this amorphous blob thing that your
[6778.15s -> 6783.48s]  body is just folding over the sides of the seat and you're just like leaning back and
[6783.48s -> 6790.18s]  you have like two drinks attached to like a helmet on your head. And there's like people,
[6791.46s -> 6795.54s]  you're getting a manicure and a pedicure on all of your hands and feet at the same time.
[6797.00s -> 6802.46s]  And when you blink, somebody else presses the button for you. That's $5,000 a spin.
[6803.42s -> 6821.85s]  If I get a big hit here. Oh my God. That would have been, I would have won. That would have been
[6821.85s -> 6838.38s]  the whole game. Okay. All right. I don't want to lose all my riches. Don't get cocky. I just,
[6839.18s -> 6848.47s]  I've got to give myself a limit down to $90,000. $90,000 is the limit. $80,000. That's a good call.
[6851.16s -> 6869.67s]  $80,000 is the limit. All right. I can, I'm still here. What about $70,000? No, that's pushing it.
[6870.39s -> 6891.66s]  Damn it. That watermelon would have been sick. You know what? $80,000. Come on. What the
[6891.66s -> 6902.28s]  fuck are you doing in here? I'm so sorry to ask you for a favor. I desperately need some cash.
[6903.72s -> 6909.64s]  Would you like to buy this diamond? I guarantee it is worth a bit. It's been appraised for $5,000.
[6910.44s -> 6920.68s]  How much will you give me for it? A lot of money. How about $500? I'll give you $500. Come on.
[6920.68s -> 6944.17s]  $500. $3,600. No. $500. No. $500. $2,800. You got yourself a deal. $2,800 bucks. I mean,
[6944.17s -> 6955.59s]  I was $5,000. All right. Guys, I spent $5,000 a spin. Big one. All right.
[6957.75s -> 6961.46s]  Mr. Greens, that's a very good imitation diamond. I'll give you $100 for it.
[6964.73s -> 6972.01s]  I don't need that. You were conned. How would you know?
[6980.79s -> 6990.18s]  How would you know? If I had a ring on and you came over, like, hey, you got a fake ring on.
[6990.98s -> 7030.12s]  Okay. I know. What if I knew that? Game sucks. $777,000. I got all $777. That's why I got out
