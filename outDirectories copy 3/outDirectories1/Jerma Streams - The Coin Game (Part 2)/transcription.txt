[13.94s -> 20.42s]  Oh, fucking leaked. Oh, Monka, Omega, Monka, Omega, Monka, Omega. He leaked it.
[21.91s -> 35.03s]  I actually leaked it. Oh, Monka, Omega. He leaked it. Just sitting there. Oops, wrong screen.
[36.95s -> 41.19s]  Okay, I'll see you later. I'll be back. I gotta have my two minute intro. Hold on.
[41.91s -> 82.39s]  All right, there we go. That's better. Hi guys, how are you?
[82.47s -> 91.78s]  Okay, welcome. If you probably could guess today, we're going to do the UFO arcade update.
[93.70s -> 100.97s]  Just dropped a couple weeks ago in the coin game. One of our old favorites from earlier in the year.
[104.46s -> 109.64s]  Today was mystery stream and there you go, mystery solved. We're going back to coin game.
[109.64s -> 114.97s]  They've added, this is a pretty significant update. I'm looking at this right now. So
[116.60s -> 125.10s]  they added 15 new games. This is not just two. Oh yeah, we got a new update for you. I don't
[125.10s -> 131.30s]  like three new games. It's 15. I don't know how different or good or we're going to check it out,
[134.01s -> 145.53s]  but that seems like a lot. Jerma hates me. What are you talking about? I don't. What? Why would
[145.53s -> 153.80s]  I, why did you say that? Bird game two out of 16? Well, no, that's what we're doing. And if there's
[153.80s -> 157.32s]  time left over at the end, depending on how long the update takes us to get through, depending how
[157.32s -> 163.42s]  many prizes I want. And we're also going to play elf bowling because I'm like three people in the
[163.42s -> 172.38s]  pre stream chat wanted me to like that. That's, there's maybe four people in the chat before the
[172.38s -> 179.11s]  stream started. They're like, Hey, play elf bowling Christmas flash game. Cause this is the last stream
[179.11s -> 186.70s]  before Christmas and I'm not streaming on Christmas. So sure. I'll play elf bowling for like 10 minutes
[187.50s -> 196.74s]  Oh, also I want to show you guys the power of the pre stream chat because this mystery was already
[196.74s -> 202.57s]  solved for people that were here like 30, 40 minutes ago. I'm going to give you a poll.
[203.37s -> 210.54s]  I'd like you to look at that poll because this is what you could have chosen. I want to see what
[210.54s -> 228.78s]  happens. Please vote for what you think you'd like to see today. Please vote. Let's see what happens.
[229.42s -> 240.90s]  Oh, it didn't work. Why does that not work? Nothing on this one. How?
[246.63s -> 260.10s]  What I do is how, why is this broken? This is, this is not the poll. This is the poll. Why is this
[260.10s -> 269.86s]  poll being like, it's whatever. Who cares? Point is you could have, there was coin game. There was
[269.86s -> 274.42s]  GTA five casino update and there was Nancy Drew on here. You could have selected one of those,
[275.38s -> 284.73s]  but they chose coin game update and that's probably what I would have chosen too. So
[284.73s -> 293.78s]  good choice. Let's do it. It's available. It's ready for us right now. I'm ready to get addicted.
[294.50s -> 302.28s]  All right. A bunch of kids just drove by in a bus screaming out the window. That bus was going
[302.28s -> 314.42s]  fast. Slow down. Let's go. Let's go. All right. Here we go. Uh, I think there's a new game mode
[314.42s -> 325.24s]  too. Is there? Oh shit. I have a saved game. Load this one. So we played this in July.
[325.80s -> 337.53s]  Can I do this? Is it? No. Survival mode isn't here yet. This will delete. Yeah. Let's go.
[341.13s -> 345.30s]  I bought everything here, right? That wasn't that long ago. No, it wasn't.
[345.30s -> 349.93s]  Felt like a long time ago though. Hey atmosphere, thanks for the five community subs.
[355.14s -> 360.89s]  No, that was kind of a long time ago, July. It was like five months ago. That's a long time.
[361.61s -> 383.10s]  Are we in? The mouse is wrong too. Yeah, it's fine. Mouse curse is misaligned. It don't matter.
[383.10s -> 388.73s]  Now it has to be aligned now. All right. How's the audio? I got 96 bucks.
[393.93s -> 401.67s]  Was it UFO? All right. You pawn. Yeah. Okay. I got a hundred. What was my like stats? Happy birthday,
[401.67s -> 413.27s]  kiddo. There it is. The boom box. I spent all five months ago trying to get where to go. Okay.
[413.27s -> 420.09s]  I just got really scared. Put it in my inventory. It's like throw it in the trash. All right. Let's
[420.09s -> 431.06s]  go to the, you can drive cars, right? Why is the game so slow? Holy shit. Somebody's trying to kill
[431.06s -> 442.52s]  me. Like I am standing in the road. All right. Let's go. Let's go check out the UFO. Wait,
[442.52s -> 447.61s]  I need money. Don't have to call. Why do I have a gun? Oh, right. Okay. It's a rubber band gun.
[447.61s -> 462.73s]  I need money. I gotta call. I gotta call my uncle for money, right? How do I get money? Total money
[462.73s -> 472.92s]  spent. So I spent $41,000. How did I win 80,000? Oh, there's lottery tickets in this game. Holy
[472.92s -> 484.50s]  shit. I forgot. I completely forgot about the lottery tickets. All right. Well, let's go. Let's
[485.22s -> 496.22s]  I gotta, I, how do I call uncle, uncle Phil? How do I ask for money? I only have $96. That's not
[496.22s -> 507.66s]  enough. I gotta remember how to play. Just fast travel. Can I do it like this? Bus passes. How
[507.66s -> 515.19s]  much is a bus pass? A doll of 50. That's actually not that bad. All right. Where am I going? I want
[515.19s -> 529.35s]  to go to the UFO point one. Click here to purchase. Thank you. Got a bus pass. Now we're going to go to
[531.18s -> 547.75s]  one. It's very loud. Why is that so loud? And nothing else is. Sound effects. All right. That's
[547.75s -> 558.26s]  probably better. Here comes a bus. How do we, uh, this is a trash car, but that's not a bus.
[558.26s -> 568.65s]  Where's the bus? You are here. Where's the bus? Oh, okay. There it is. All right. I want to go to,
[568.65s -> 575.30s]  I want to go to one. I want to go to UFO point. Is this going to UFO point? This is going to
[575.30s -> 581.94s]  Barry's pond. No, we're at Barry's pond. How do I choose where I want to go? I don't want to give
[581.94s -> 584.50s]  my bus pass. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'll give it. I'll give it a
[584.50s -> 592.28s]  give it. Let me in. Okay. Where are we going? Beach front. Oh, okay. I get off. It's a bus.
[593.75s -> 601.29s]  I never, I never took the bus. You just get out when you want. Right. Okay. I never took,
[601.29s -> 608.52s]  I took the subway guys. You got, I lived in, I lived, I lived in Boston in my, in almost my
[608.52s -> 626.97s]  entire life. So I took the subway. It's not the same thing. I took the T like the, the T stops,
[630.74s -> 641.19s]  the MBTA buses don't exist in Boston. I don't even, I think they do, but not like you think
[643.43s -> 665.67s]  the CBTA watch out, watch out. All right. Where I can't, I can't see that far. Can I stand up?
[671.00s -> 679.70s]  Press E. Should I get off now? No, we're not there yet. That's Larry's arcade. I want to go to the
[679.70s -> 690.60s]  UFO. The UFO is the arcade, the new one. I don't know what I have to also call my dad for more
[690.60s -> 698.89s]  money. All right. This is home. My home is the gas station. How does that make any sense?
[699.45s -> 713.40s]  There's a long bus. Like I could have just walked there. I have to go to the money grabbing machine.
[713.40s -> 722.14s]  Right. Well, let's see what I can play with 94 dollars. This is just actually a real bus.
[723.18s -> 734.81s]  Next stop. What's after home? Mountains. This is taking me all over the whole city.
[735.45s -> 752.14s]  You're going to get motion sick. Why am I going to get motion sick? I don't think this is even
[752.14s -> 768.58s]  in the game last time I played. All right. UFO peer is coming up next. Nobody's getting on or
[768.58s -> 774.50s]  off the bus. This is kind of depressing. The newspaper behind you says Jeremy. No, it says
[774.50s -> 785.62s]  Jerry's. All right. Coming out. Here we go. UFO peer. How does a bus work? Uh, it drives around
[785.62s -> 791.46s]  in a circle and lets people off at designated stops. You can then get on the bus or get off
[791.46s -> 797.06s]  at any of those designated stops. As long as you have a ticket to get on. This is half life too.
[807.42s -> 814.36s]  It kind of is. This is how long it takes in half life too to go. The only difference is
[814.36s -> 821.02s]  we're not getting the voiceovers. Fuck the Drew crew bro. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[821.74s -> 834.12s]  You don't come to the Drew crew turf and talk like that. What? Jesus. That actually scared the shit
[834.12s -> 852.07s]  out of me. I was just here. We did a full circle. Where's the UFO? What is the point of taking the
[852.07s -> 863.70s]  bus if we just went around in a full circle? Can I get off? He just called half life two,
[863.70s -> 871.11s]  half life one. I did. No, you get on. This is like a train in half life two that you,
[871.11s -> 882.90s]  or is that half life one? That happens in both. That happens in both. Yeah. What are you talking
[882.90s -> 895.74s]  about? It happens in both you fake gamer. There it is. Oh, look it. It's so glorious. Look at how
[895.74s -> 907.42s]  glorious that is. It's awesome. All right. Let's go. Wow. I can't wait to go in there and spend
[907.42s -> 922.66s]  some tokens. UFO. What does this say? Raceway and fun center. All right. It's done. It's ready.
[922.66s -> 936.89s]  It's ready for us to enjoy. Let's go. Oh, wow. Wait, this go-karts in here too? This is go-karts.
[940.18s -> 948.86s]  Holy shit. It's awesome. What are the new games? Butterfly catcher? Oh, you got to do the thing
[948.86s -> 952.22s]  you do when you go into every new arcade. You don't spend any money. You just walk around and
[952.22s -> 958.86s]  go, oh, look at this one. All right. What about this next one? Mermaids from space. It's coin one.
[961.03s -> 974.14s]  Nice. Ski ball. Clock tower. Whack a mole. What's this one? Oh, down a bot. I know this one. This
[974.14s -> 987.29s]  one's good. Iceberg bounce. I think we've played this one. Maybe not. Just toss it. Ooh, ticket
[987.29s -> 999.34s]  redemption center. I want to see the prizes of the UFO one. What do you get for prizes? Alien
[999.34s -> 1007.26s]  plush green. Aliens. A pet moon rock. That's pretty sick. We're going to get all the planets. I hope
[1007.26s -> 1019.40s]  Jupiter's on here. Lava lamp. Fun capacitor. Plasma ball. It's one of these things you put your hand
[1019.40s -> 1027.67s]  on. Light sword. Oh, there's lightsabers in this one. Oh, my God. How many? Hover board is 100,000
[1027.67s -> 1039.26s]  tickets. Okay, it's 100,000 tickets to the hover board. I want a lightsaber. I want I want the blue
[1039.26s -> 1047.06s]  lightsaber. I want the hover board. And I want the thing that you put your hand on. Get the hover
[1047.06s -> 1053.22s]  board. All right, I will. I also am going to turn the sound down again, because it's I'm going to
[1053.22s -> 1069.42s]  hurt somebody. All right, that sounds good. Let's go. Wait, what else is in here? This thing. This
[1069.42s -> 1078.23s]  thing sucks. You can't win this thing. It's the do-goo. This one's actually rigged. They've made
[1078.23s -> 1082.95s]  videos on this one. It's actually impossible to win unless the person that's operating it wants
[1082.95s -> 1092.94s]  you to win. Hold on. There's a claw gate. Isn't there upstairs too? Popcorn Pete. Hey, kids,
[1092.94s -> 1098.70s]  I win an official popcorn Pete plush toy. Collect all eight cards and win a Pete plush.
[1101.53s -> 1104.25s]  Ah, look at this. There's a popcorn machine too.
[1105.37s -> 1110.17s]  Fucking game of the year. You want to know what my game of the year is? This. Dude, where's my cow?
[1111.05s -> 1127.96s]  Oh, what is this one? Wormhole. Let's check out the back. DeVito Do? DeVi-Devo-Devotted Do.
[1128.76s -> 1153.02s]  I'll take one. Give me it. Give me another one. Give me more. Give me more Danny DeVito Do.
[1155.66s -> 1172.18s]  It's so loud. I tried to turn it down. How loud is that? Is it so loud that you can't even stand it?
[1172.74s -> 1187.03s]  It probably is. I'm gonna give it a ceiling. That should help. You let me know. This is a
[1187.03s -> 1208.12s]  test to see if it hurts. Tell me if it hurts. Pretty good. I'll take another one. Oh shit.
[1209.46s -> 1223.45s]  Let's do it again. I'm making a tower. How many can I put on one tower? Oh my god.
[1224.55s -> 1234.31s]  That's like six. Imagine seeing somebody do this. I feel like you draw a crowd at this point.
[1237.78s -> 1244.46s]  I think that's the end of the tower. Oh my god. It's not. It's almost as tall as me.
[1247.85s -> 1262.23s]  I'm wasting money. Oh shit. I am wasting money. You're right. Oh, that's it. Hold on.
[1273.46s -> 1294.62s]  Whatever. We got six. Who cares? Oh, money machine. Let's go. Just like at the carnival.
[1294.62s -> 1308.58s]  This isn't a restroom. I'm not going to the bathroom in here. Quick. Get the bits. Get the
[1308.58s -> 1354.18s]  hundred. Oh. Monka. Omega. All right. Let me out. I'm thrown out of here instantly. Throw it like
[1354.18s -> 1360.70s]  onto the track. All right. I'll get those later. Let me go upstairs. I want to see what's upstairs.
[1368.22s -> 1381.80s]  What is up here? Laser zone? What is laser zone? Welcome to laser zone. It's five bucks.
[1381.80s -> 1390.15s]  It's laser tag. All right. What else is over here? Okay. You just can go down to the go-karts.
[1391.46s -> 1394.18s]  And that's what's that. All right. Let's go. Let's do laser tag first.
[1398.78s -> 1406.94s]  This is a pretty substantial update. How do? What is going on? I can't. I'm not.
[1408.78s -> 1420.81s]  You gotta go. Go for the base. Go for the base. Go for the base. Here's the actual pro tip when
[1420.81s -> 1426.17s]  you're playing anything. Any laser tag. Sneak around back to the base. Usually it's a dome.
[1426.17s -> 1432.33s]  That's all the way in their corner. And just hold down the trigger. Just at the base. You'll be
[1432.33s -> 1437.37s]  number one on the leaderboards every time. Don't even fight anybody. Do not fire at any other
[1437.37s -> 1441.13s]  people. Use all your ammo only for the small little light dome that's in their base.
[1444.28s -> 1450.04s]  It's funny because people will just ignore you. I just died. You'll get 100% ignored.
[1451.00s -> 1468.60s]  Where's my ammo? How do I get ammo? Ammo? Where's ammo? Oh, recharge station. Here we go.
[1469.56s -> 1477.86s]  All right. Let's do it. But yeah, a typical laser tag game is about,
[1477.86s -> 1481.94s]  I don't know, it'll be 15 minutes. You could spend a full 13 and a half minutes as long as
[1481.94s -> 1486.58s]  you sneak into the back of their base. You'll have like 60 million points. And when they print
[1486.58s -> 1493.62s]  out the scorecard showing how awesome everybody was, you'll be, you'd be like insanely, you'd be
[1493.62s -> 1499.27s]  so out of reach. Let me do it now. Well, these people, there's no, I don't think there is a base.
[1507.93s -> 1513.19s]  No roughhousing. I would have just got yelled at. A whistle would have just gotten like blown.
[1515.26s -> 1529.53s]  It is still so loud though. I have to like do it manually again. Where are they? Are they dead?
[1530.81s -> 1542.10s]  Got them both. Game over. Oh, I got a two. All right. That was, that's a 2.0 K.D. That's not bad.
[1542.82s -> 1553.54s]  I just got 400 tickets for doing that. Holy, that's a lot. I'm doing that again.
[1554.26s -> 1563.54s]  This time I'm going to try as hard as I can. I understand the game now. Let's go. It's time to
[1563.54s -> 1569.22s]  be the very clear adult that shouldn't be in there that's killing everybody. You know what I mean?
[1569.22s -> 1574.76s]  That's like tagging everybody. There's some dad that's just going overboard and just like,
[1574.76s -> 1584.79s]  got you, got you, got you, got you. Oh, I got you through the wall. Yeah, you're dead. It's like,
[1584.79s -> 1590.98s]  Jesus, come on dad, fucking relax. No, no, you have to go back. Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[1592.26s -> 1608.57s]  Got you. Call your hits. Yeah, this is, this is annoying older kid or dad that's going too hard.
[1608.57s -> 1616.98s]  This is also the dad that when he comes out of this, he has a full band of sweat on his head.
[1617.78s -> 1625.74s]  Do a laser tag stream. That actually might be like kind of funny.
[1632.47s -> 1636.26s]  You'd have to find a place that would allow you to do that though.
[1642.58s -> 1654.14s]  Back to spawn. Literally spawn camping children. It's also the worst when you realize,
[1655.10s -> 1659.64s]  so when you play laser tag and you, it can be very disorienting. There's fog machines,
[1659.96s -> 1664.36s]  loud music, there's lights everywhere. Somebody on the other team could just be standing behind
[1664.36s -> 1671.72s]  you, walking behind you the whole time, going like this to your back. And you just have no idea.
[1674.84s -> 1678.68s]  It sucks because then you'll go look at your score, which a lot of these places,
[1678.68s -> 1682.04s]  they'd like, I said, they do a printout and it shows you like your, your accuracy and,
[1682.04s -> 1687.08s]  and it looks like times hit 680. And you look at the person next to you and you're like,
[1687.08s -> 1692.52s]  what did you give times hit? Oh, four. Oh, what the fuck?
[1695.56s -> 1705.54s]  How many tickets is that? Um, guys, this is where you farm. The tickets is right here.
[1705.54s -> 1707.86s]  We're getting that hoverboard. All right. Well, I'll, I'll come back.
[1710.15s -> 1736.22s]  18 KD. Nice job, dad. Let's do the, uh, go-karts. Nice. See, look, little Doug.
[1737.10s -> 1747.29s]  You know what always scared me about this? Anytime you went to a place that had go-karts,
[1748.25s -> 1755.29s]  the staff for some reason would just be walking around, like on the track and shit.
[1756.01s -> 1761.06s]  And I'd always be so scared to drive fast because somebody would just be walking by. It's like,
[1761.06s -> 1764.90s]  Oh shit. That person, that, that's it. They don't care. It's just a staff member.
[1764.90s -> 1778.07s]  I see him like 300 feet away. They're like moving. Yeah. They'd be like,
[1778.07s -> 1789.74s]  there's like a guy smoking a cigarette, like right there. This is how you drive.
[1790.62s -> 1804.28s]  No, this is not an indicator of how I drive. And it always was so annoying because the somebody,
[1804.28s -> 1808.84s]  when you knew you were on your last lap, you'd see the worker come and close the gate and you're
[1808.84s -> 1812.52s]  like, no, don't close the gate. And you have to go the other way. There's a separate way you have
[1812.52s -> 1820.17s]  to go to put the carts back. Still in last place. I don't know if this was a competition five seconds
[1820.17s -> 1852.30s]  ago. Am I on one wheel? I wish I had a controller. Oh, that was a tight turn. And that was tight
[1852.30s -> 1862.52s]  turn. He had a red shell. How have they not made a game that was, you know, those VR experiences,
[1862.52s -> 1868.12s]  how they're all stupid. Come check out the VR experience where you get like a little laser gun
[1868.12s -> 1874.94s]  and the polygons are five times bigger than they should be. Why not have a Mario Kart style
[1875.58s -> 1880.86s]  VR experience where there's like 12 seats, everyone's in a car and it moves around this
[1880.86s -> 1888.26s]  feedback and you're actually in like a Mario Kart style race. That exists. Oh, I want to play it.
[1888.90s -> 1895.96s]  Where do I play that? I have to come in first place eventually here. Not now though. I just
[1895.96s -> 1913.48s]  want to check it out that they literally do that in Japan. Are you serious? Japan seriously is
[1914.76s -> 1919.56s]  that one place on earth where they seem to just do everything better than everybody else for some
[1919.56s -> 1924.04s]  reason. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah, we have arcades here in America. Yeah, yeah, we do.
[1926.58s -> 1935.64s]  Oh, they're really fun. Sometimes this you can play Mortal Kombat 3. Oh, no, you can't. Sorry,
[1935.64s -> 1938.68s]  both of the coin slots have been taped over because the machine's broken.
[1939.48s -> 1943.45s]  You want to play the new Halo game where you can shoot as Master Chief?
[1944.41s -> 1949.21s]  Go, good luck. There's always four people sitting in there and they're part of the same four friends
[1949.21s -> 1954.17s]  that came and they're not leaving that booth. They never get out until they like they beat the game.
[1955.37s -> 1961.40s]  I feel like this place is in Japan where I can put on a headset and eat food but not in real life,
[1961.40s -> 1972.20s]  but I still get full of nutrition and stuff. Also, very, very, very important. When are arcades
[1972.20s -> 1977.72s]  going to implement the old school Super Nintendo Mario comes up and says it's time for somebody
[1977.72s -> 1981.80s]  else to play? Remember that shit when you went to used to go to GameStop? We're like,
[1982.68s -> 1990.41s]  why don't they do that? Those of you that don't know, in every GameStop, in most video game stores
[1990.41s -> 1994.81s]  or boutique stores, whatever, there was always like a Super Nintendo or PlayStation 1 in the corner.
[1994.81s -> 2001.13s]  That was just a demo. You could just play it was various games. If you stayed on that for more than
[2001.13s -> 2006.49s]  15 to 20 straight minutes, Mario would come on. It would go to a black screen. Mario would appear
[2006.49s -> 2013.43s]  and go, thank you. Next person in line, please. That, yes, it did. That happened. And that person
[2013.43s -> 2019.62s]  would have to leave. Otherwise, it would look like a total asshole. Yes, that happened. Yes, it did.
[2019.62s -> 2031.38s]  It's real. Making that up. You're paying money though to play that one. Yeah, but I got money.
[2031.38s -> 2040.49s]  I want to pay too. Will they have more than one machine then? All right, let's do this one. I'm
[2040.49s -> 2046.68s]  going for it. How much does this one cost? Two bucks. That's a lot. First fucking try. That's how
[2046.68s -> 2054.31s]  we do a first try jackpot. I'll take a first try jackpot. Thank you. Everybody show up. Everybody,
[2054.31s -> 2065.05s]  that's me you're talking to. That's me you're talking to. Let's do it again. These are my tickets.
[2065.05s -> 2081.35s]  Get the fuck out of here. Again. I'll never get it again. Spin again. Yeah, it's like laggy.
[2082.31s -> 2103.06s]  Again. Again. What's the jackpot at now? Fuck, he's going to chase that high all night.
[2109.83s -> 2135.91s]  I'll take another jackpot. That's two. He's just lucky. I don't think he is. I don't think he is.
[2138.58s -> 2147.05s]  I think he's got the skill to be able to get a... How many tickets do I need? A lot. I'm going to
[2147.05s -> 2157.05s]  trip on these. Is money laundering going on in here? No, there's no money laundering. I don't do
[2157.05s -> 2162.74s]  that. Here's the problem with this machine though. You'll get so frustrated playing this machine.
[2163.38s -> 2166.50s]  Typically, this is how you do it. You put your money in. You wait. Okay, go around.
[2167.30s -> 2173.91s]  Go around. Gah, I missed. But you'll do this 10 times in a row and get so frustrated that you
[2173.91s -> 2178.15s]  try to catch it instantly right when you activate and put your money in like this.
[2180.52s -> 2203.32s]  Fuck. Let's go again. Okay. I am unstoppable. What? Did I get two in a row? I did it. I
[2203.32s -> 2213.30s]  didn't do it. I did it. Security? Why is this guy going to explode? What's going on? Why is
[2213.30s -> 2220.76s]  this person going to explode? Get this person. This person's a bomb. This person's going to explode.
[2222.90s -> 2251.58s]  What the fuck? Get out of here. Get the bomb out. Get him out. What about my tickets? Again,
[2251.58s -> 2276.54s]  it's a sparkler. Whatever. I'm going to get kicked out of the casino. I'm going to get
[2276.54s -> 2290.70s]  kicked out of the casino. No, I can't do that right now. Did the game crash? Let's do it again.
[2291.34s -> 2293.10s]  Hey, Jeff. Thanks for the five community subs.
[2332.81s -> 2350.97s]  I can't lose. I can't lose. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me count. Let
[2350.97s -> 2362.97s]  me see my winnings. Get it out of here. No. Look at the jackpot keeps going up. I'm going to...
[2364.01s -> 2366.57s]  You think I'm not going to get that hoverboard? Are you serious? Let's go count the tickets.
[2369.35s -> 2380.81s]  Out of my way. That's 4,000 tickets already. You don't think I'm going to get 100,000?
[2382.38s -> 2385.26s]  Oh, what's this one? How much money do I have? 94. Cool. Let's start over here. Right here. This
[2385.26s -> 2389.74s]  sounds good. How do you play this one? How does this one go? Just toss it. You throw the ball.
[2389.74s -> 2401.83s]  Cool. This sounds fun. I'm going to do it right now. That's fine. Let's go. Oh, I'm going to be
[2401.83s -> 2415.37s]  obsessed with this. I'm going to be... I just toss it forehead. You don't think I'm going to
[2415.37s -> 2422.10s]  do this one again? Absolutely. How many do I need? How many points do you actually need to win the
[2422.10s -> 2454.23s]  super jackpot? Oh, shit. Again, I did it. 270 tickets. Again, I'm going to try to get more
[2454.23s -> 2482.42s]  than once. It's only 200. Yeah. I mean, come on. What's this jackpot? Oh, I almost just soft locked
[2482.42s -> 2487.86s]  it. Yeah, that was close. Oops. Oh, God damn it. I actually, I didn't, I really didn't mean to do
[2487.86s -> 2503.43s]  that. I went too high. What? Like you've never done that before? Please. I got it again. I mean,
[2503.43s -> 2508.57s]  no. You've never accidentally tried to throw something in one of these things that just
[2508.57s -> 2516.76s]  bounces back and hits you in this chest. That does happen. That's never happened to you.
[2518.47s -> 2522.47s]  You've never been playing like the football game or the throw the thing, toss the thing,
[2522.47s -> 2527.58s]  and you go a little too hard and it bounces back and hits you in the chest. You know,
[2527.58s -> 2533.50s]  the throw the football through the holes. You've never hit the, you've never missed the one you're
[2533.50s -> 2537.34s]  trying to hit the little one at the very bottom and it bounces back and hits you in the face.
[2538.06s -> 2556.86s]  I got it again. You're taking the, I'm an idiot too far. I feel like we've been to different
[2556.86s -> 2567.59s]  arcades. I'm sorry. Those of you, everybody, everybody over the age of like 28 in the chat
[2567.59s -> 2573.13s]  right now. This is like probably eight of you. You remember playing the throw the ball. You had
[2573.13s -> 2579.59s]  to like throw it hard because the shit was broken half the time. Throw the ball into the hole and
[2579.59s -> 2582.87s]  it wouldn't go in. So you had to throw it kind of hard and it would bounce back and hit you in the
[2582.87s -> 2603.58s]  stomach hole in the sign. Oh shit. You're right. Hole in the sign, hole in the sign, hole in the sign.
[2604.79s -> 2608.47s]  I once bounced a basketball at the top of the cage in the hoop game and smashed myself in the
[2608.47s -> 2617.82s]  face and started crying. Thank you. Thank you for explaining how this happens. I don't think I can
[2617.82s -> 2636.14s]  make that. Oh guys, I don't think that's possible. Is it? It might be possible. Oh,
[2636.86s -> 2649.72s]  it's going to be possible. Shit. Stop wasting throws. It's all right. I got, I have $84.
[2651.54s -> 2654.18s]  Yeah. I'm the guy that walks into the arcade with a hundred dollars.
[2666.62s -> 2680.97s]  A little higher. This is going to kill me. More power. I'm holding it down as far as I can go.
[2681.69s -> 2692.07s]  I might, I might have to come back to this.
[2694.65s -> 2705.54s]  Give a shot. Put a bowling ball. No, because that's dangerous and stupid. I'm not going to hit this.
[2707.66s -> 2713.83s]  Aim. Like that's no, it doesn't do anything. You can't bounce it.
[2722.23s -> 2737.88s]  What happened? Where'd it go? Oh, all right. I'm never going to get it. I'm never going to get it.
[2737.88s -> 2747.32s]  Leave. Maybe I'll try it later. Another day. All right. What's next? I want to play it though. All
[2747.32s -> 2753.75s]  right. Is this one. I, this one's fun. This is when you throw a bunch of a ping.
[2756.31s -> 2766.66s]  That's going to happen every time in it. Now there is strategy with this one. What you do is
[2766.66s -> 2773.53s]  you scoop up all of them. There's usually about maybe 20 or 30. You get as many as you can hold
[2773.53s -> 2778.25s]  in your arms and you just toss them all up at the exact same time over here. And you just, that's,
[2778.25s -> 2786.49s]  you'll hit most of them. Game. It's going to do that loud song again, isn't it?
[2791.21s -> 2822.25s]  All right. Here we go. Come on, get them all. Ah, do it again. I get it. Cheating. How am I
[2822.25s -> 2843.77s]  cheating? Get the ones in the front first. Get it. That's it. I got them all. That one wasn't even
[2843.77s -> 2848.49s]  hard. Bonus round.
[2858.74s -> 2862.02s]  Shit. Okay. That's gonna, I gotta get it. You gotta do bonus first.
[2866.39s -> 2891.80s]  First part's not hard. Get it. Get this last one. Get the last one, please. Get the last one.
[2891.96s -> 2897.21s]  Bonus round. Go with the front row first.
[2920.01s -> 2938.71s]  It's loud for me. So what's the strategy? Middle out? You think? Like middle out. Middle out?
[2945.26s -> 2955.50s]  Just throw fast. All right. I'm just going to spam them. Spam. Spam. Spam. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.
[2957.18s -> 2961.59s]  That shit's impossible. This is not even possible. I don't think it's even possible.
[2961.59s -> 2964.07s]  It's gonna take insane long. It's not even possible.
[2971.19s -> 2977.42s]  What about off the edge? I mean, it doesn't really do much.
[2979.42s -> 2991.11s]  Okay, one more time. That's it. Final attempt. And then moving on to down the bot, whatever it's
[2991.11s -> 3008.60s]  called. Bonus round. There you go. You can't do it. It's not possible. Whatever.
[3010.94s -> 3015.53s]  I'm getting a lot of time today. Okay. All right. Let's move on.
[3020.81s -> 3025.08s]  Nice. All right. Here we go. Here's one of the games I'm talking about, guys.
[3026.55s -> 3031.03s]  If you've ever played this before, you whip balls at these things.
[3045.35s -> 3054.22s]  Oh, I got to get this better. I can do this better. I can do that better. 500 or go home.
[3056.12s -> 3059.00s]  I think. Yeah. 500 points or go home.
[3072.42s -> 3075.06s]  They're already down. They can't go down anymore.
[3081.00s -> 3085.56s]  How's that worse than last time? It got, it fucked up.
[3091.62s -> 3093.86s]  Aim for the one that has red light. Yeah, that's what I was doing.
[3095.58s -> 3100.50s]  Oh, this is going to be worse.
[3114.58s -> 3124.87s]  Now you got it. Okay. I got it. I got plenty of money. I'm bad. All right. Sure.
[3143.45s -> 3152.63s]  It's not, that wasn't bad. That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad. 380 down as many as possible.
[3152.63s -> 3178.82s]  The light is bait. Is that true? Is it light bait? The light is bait. All right. Light is bait.
[3181.62s -> 3184.98s]  I'm going for just a full on hit. Every single, I have to, if you hit every single throw,
[3184.98s -> 3186.90s]  you'll get 500. That should work.
[3205.13s -> 3215.62s]  God damn it. Shoot between them. It's, it's just my sensitivity.
[3218.10s -> 3229.67s]  Oh, don't go for the top ones. Bad idea. Let's try to, it says that I need more sensitivity.
[3244.68s -> 3248.68s]  I'm going to get, ah, I'm going to get stuck here. I'm going to get stuck here. It's okay.
[3248.68s -> 3256.34s]  I'm going to do it. I need to get at least 400 or something.
[3257.66s -> 3282.41s]  Oh, all right. I keep getting stuck in the same spot. Go for doubles only. Let me see.
[3284.41s -> 3294.97s]  That's not reliable. Now doubles ain't reliable. Check that.
[3294.97s -> 3312.30s]  Doubles ain't reliable. Now doubles ain't reliable. Unfortunately doubles just kind
[3312.30s -> 3316.54s]  of happen to try a second row. Maybe it just farm doubles in the second row. Maybe we'll see.
[3317.50s -> 3328.25s]  Okay. You can do, we're only going to do the, the, the bottom and the, okay. We're going farming
[3328.25s -> 3341.90s]  doubles. I'm just a psycho. Do you have to be? All right. Let's try it for real this time.
[3341.90s -> 3371.86s]  And I'm moving on. We're going to skee ball next. What? That's, that's too hard to do that. I need
[3371.86s -> 3375.94s]  more sensitivity. All right. Last one. Finally, actually last one. I'm just going to go try as
[3375.94s -> 3403.80s]  many as I can. This is bait. It's fine. Here we go. I don't, I don't care. I don't care. I don't
[3403.80s -> 3408.95s]  care. It's, it's the sensitivity. It's got to be higher. I can't move. Just no, no, get me out.
[3408.95s -> 3416.86s]  Get me out. Get me out of here. No, if I increase sensitivity, I'll stay there for like another three
[3416.86s -> 3445.50s]  hours. Sure. Is there sensitivity? I don't know. There is no sensitivity. Well, let's go. This is
[3445.50s -> 3451.10s]  just original skee ball. I think this one's in the old game, but this one's a, it has a, yeah,
[3451.10s -> 3468.34s]  this one has a space theme to it. Skee ball is one of those games that you seriously get. I get
[3469.22s -> 3473.58s]  oh, Jeremy, that's never happened to me in an arcade before. No way. I, when I play skee ball,
[3473.58s -> 3482.58s]  if I, if I, that never happens to me. Yes, it does. No, I've never rolled a little too hard
[3482.58s -> 3493.78s]  for it to hit the back and go forward. What are you, what are you, what are you for? No,
[3493.78s -> 3498.82s]  Jeremy, I've never walked over to the side and placed every single ball in the hundred. No,
[3498.90s -> 3523.00s]  Jeremy, I'm such a good boy. Not everyone's as bad as you, boomer. You guys are describing
[3523.00s -> 3532.86s]  a technique that I did maybe when I was 11. I wasn't a boomer when I was 11. 50 points.
[3532.86s -> 3550.84s]  I can do better than that. I can do much better than that. 11 year old boomer. Everything's a
[3550.84s -> 3559.93s]  boomer. Guys, I'm drinking a coffee right now. It's pretty good. That's boomer coffee.
[3562.33s -> 3571.06s]  I drink my, this coffee's better. Oh, okay. Uh, guys, I drive, uh, I drive a Honda Civic.
[3571.06s -> 3585.37s]  That's a boomer car. Oh, okay. Guys, I buy a Charmin ultra soft toilet paper. That's a boomer
[3585.37s -> 3604.01s]  toilet paper. I use it per day. Okay. Hope you're having a good day. I am. Hey, thanks.
[3604.65s -> 3614.87s]  Hope you're having a good day too. I gotta get at least 100 before I leave.
[3614.87s -> 3627.72s]  What's my favorite ice cream? Mom's bacon cookie from Baskin Robbins. It's the best ice cream ever
[3627.72s -> 3634.30s]  and I think it no longer exists. I tweeted about it and they deleted it off their menu.
[3635.85s -> 3640.86s]  That tweet, by the way, had like 600,000 impressions on it. Why would you get rid of
[3640.86s -> 3644.94s]  that ice cream after, after somebody that literally has hundreds of millions of people
[3644.94s -> 3657.16s]  viewing their Twitter? How could you do something like that? Impressions. Well, how many impressions
[3657.16s -> 3665.42s]  did that get? I don't know. Who gives a shit? You know what impressions means, guys? I'm going to
[3665.42s -> 3670.94s]  give you some, some fucking influencer lingo here. Those of you that don't know, that is actually
[3670.94s -> 3676.22s]  how many times people may have even just scrolled by and not given a shit about the thing that you
[3676.22s -> 3692.46s]  said. Yeah, but they, but they still, they still went by it. Okay. Fucking boomers. Am I right?
[3693.10s -> 3711.90s]  I have to get a hundred. Come on. I can't find mom's bacon cookies. I know it's actually
[3711.90s -> 3720.04s]  unfortunate. It actually is. He's trying to be probably, probably was like seasonal
[3724.54s -> 3728.14s]  and I know I'm going to say this, but imagine having seasonal ice cream.
[3732.02s -> 3742.38s]  Is that, is that real? It's, it's not like pineapples are not in season. You know what I mean?
[3742.38s -> 3759.08s]  It's ice cream. Seasonal pizza. I have to get a hundred. Why can I not get a hundred?
[3760.04s -> 3771.32s]  Pumpkin spice lover is suffering. I don't, I don't know. Okay. I guess I do get it. It's like a
[3771.32s -> 3775.72s]  marketing thing where it's like pumpkin spice during the fall. Ooh, warm and spicy and it's warm
[3775.72s -> 3782.97s]  in your belly. Ooh, okay. But that pumpkin spice comes out of a bag. It's a powder that comes out
[3782.97s -> 3788.17s]  of a bag. It's not like, Oh, good thing these pumpkins are in season. My fresh pumpkin brains.
[3788.17s -> 3811.80s]  That's what you know. Get in there. I'm going to go aim down and yeah. All right. That's the
[3812.28s -> 3823.62s]  that's just, I'm going to aim down right there. A little bit higher sorting algorithm noise.
[3827.26s -> 3834.14s]  Oh yeah. I know what you're talking about. The things they, yeah. Oh, you're killing me. Yep.
[3845.43s -> 3856.26s]  Oh, I have to listen to it now. Then it goes like, Oh, I have to hear it right now. Let's go.
[3864.14s -> 3898.50s]  This is going to be loud as fuck. Hold on. Sorting algorithms. Yes. Ah, louder. No, it's like,
[3898.50s -> 3904.38s]  it's too, this is the best part. It gives the best part. Everyone quiet. Here comes the best part.
[3904.94s -> 3917.05s]  No, no, not this one. It doesn't, it goes. I'll wake my favorite one. No, fuck that one. That one
[3917.05s -> 3927.43s]  sucks. Dumb. Where is it? Here it comes. I think this is the one. This is the one. No, no, no, not
[3927.43s -> 3940.22s]  this one. It's a, it's one that's in two different sections. It's the one coming up next. Show it on
[3940.22s -> 3955.08s]  stream. Okay. I just want to show you my favorite one. It's all others are not even close. Not even
[3955.08s -> 3984.86s]  fucking close. Give me this. Where's my source? All right. Here it comes. Can you see it? No, you
[3984.86s -> 4010.78s]  can't. People are going, dude, I don't, not that one. Not this one. Boom. Next one, please. Not
[4010.78s -> 4030.89s]  this one either. Fuck this one. This one. Ready? Here it comes. This one. Yeah. Here it comes. The
[4030.89s -> 4048.23s]  best part. It's the best part. Oh, that was the best part. All right. No, no, fuck that. Let's go
[4048.23s -> 4072.97s]  back to this. It's really that sound. That's so fucking funny. I have to get it in a hundred
[4072.97s -> 4095.94s]  before I do anything. I can't know. It's lower octave. Stop getting tens. I'm trying to get a
[4095.94s -> 4112.36s]  hundred. I'm never going to get a hundred. Jerma, I just joined and the first thing to hear is
[4112.36s -> 4122.31s]  sorting algorithms. Why? Um, hold on. My, my, my, I'm, I can't even, somebody just complained
[4123.19s -> 4128.90s]  about the sorting algorithm. I, that's, I can't, I can't hear that right now.
[4137.56s -> 4144.34s]  You've complained about it before, have I? Oh, that's my favorite sorting algorithm. Skeeball.
[4145.80s -> 4163.74s]  See, here is the peer, the packets of data. Give me a hundred. Oh my fucking God. What was wrong
[4163.74s -> 4199.48s]  with that? I can't. It's, I need a new machine. It's definitely the angle. It's the angle. No.
[4199.48s -> 4203.26s]  Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. You don't think you've ever
[4203.26s -> 4210.97s]  hit a hundred in real life. Yep. You got to go up. There's actually a strategy. If you,
[4210.97s -> 4216.50s]  here's the thing about the hundred. When you hit the hundred, you just, you get into the zone
[4217.83s -> 4221.51s]  and you get two, three or four hundreds in a row. And then for the rest of the night,
[4221.51s -> 4242.34s]  you'll never hit one more. In fact, it might not happen for years. I have to hit this. Like
[4242.34s -> 4249.42s]  this is not this difficult. More than that. I'm not, I'm just going to, but the thing is I can't
[4249.42s -> 4258.73s]  keep the same angle because the game forces you down. Nancy drew waiting. You had a chance to
[4258.73s -> 4287.99s]  vote for Nancy drew and you soiled it. Why can I not do this? Why can I not do this? Good. Done.
[4287.99s -> 4305.90s]  I did it. What happened to that? Jesus. You suck. It is not easy to get it in this game. It's not
[4305.90s -> 4317.24s]  easy to do. I think this is so easy. It's not. That's it. That's not easy. Oh, okay. At least
[4317.32s -> 4328.34s]  I heard the noise. Let's go. I cash in the tickets. See if I can get a lightsaber.
[4328.98s -> 4342.52s]  What do I have? 4,397. Let's go. I tried here. All right. We're almost 10% of the way to the
[4342.52s -> 4348.73s]  hoverboard. I'm just going to farm that. You know, I'm going to farm that. All right. What else we
[4348.73s -> 4357.46s]  got? We're doing full circle and then we go in middle. That one looks cool. This was already,
[4357.46s -> 4380.33s]  this was a 500. What? I'll take it. Mermaids from space. Mermaids and face coin pushers.
[4381.67s -> 4386.63s]  Five tickets, 10 tickets. You collect these. Anything else I need to know? All right. Let's
[4386.63s -> 4405.32s]  go. Multi credit. How many credits to load? 10. How many? I have 120 coins. This one is,
[4405.32s -> 4414.42s]  I love this already. Oh, I wish, this is why I wish this existed. This one, exact one.
[4415.06s -> 4434.73s]  All right. I got bonus. What did I do? Coin pusher. Pog. Yeah. Now this is content.
[4435.83s -> 4452.50s]  This is the content that you came to this stream for. There it is. Where's the 100? There's 100
[4452.50s -> 4463.86s]  right here. I'll get it. Here it comes. Usually it's quarters and takes forever. Yeah. Oh,
[4463.86s -> 4476.92s]  it's still going. Still going. Yeah, that was good. That was a really good one. Right side now.
[4476.92s -> 4485.98s]  Look at all this delicious stuff on the right side. Watch this. We're going to get an avalanche
[4485.98s -> 4501.88s]  right now. That's a burger boy tactic. Yeah, it is. Burger boy tactics work, guys. People want
[4501.88s -> 4509.77s]  patience. No, no, no, no. Just, you have to use the burger boy technique. Once that 100 goes down,
[4509.77s -> 4529.42s]  we're going to the left side. Just kill it. Kill the whole thing. Is this burger boy technique
[4529.42s -> 4549.72s]  or is this bored rich kid? I don't know. Last push. Oh, 1,290 tickets. 1,300 tickets. 1,400 tickets.
[4551.22s -> 4568.60s]  Wow. You just got yourself 1,400 more tickets there. And credits. Get in the center. Oh,
[4568.60s -> 4576.39s]  shit. You're right. Look at all that in the center. 1,400 tickets. Cool. I like that they're green so
[4576.39s -> 4597.80s]  I can pretend that it's money. Again, last one. Last one. We're going right in the middle. Yeah,
[4597.80s -> 4605.19s]  the bored rich kid. There are people meticulously crafting their next shot with the quarter that
[4605.19s -> 4610.63s]  they have. Well, this dickhead over here is just spamming them. That doesn't even matter to him,
[4610.63s -> 4625.00s]  apparently. This is going to be a lot. Look at this huge wave coming in. Spamming is not smart
[4625.00s -> 4636.63s]  because all the coins land on each other. Yeah, I know. In fact, I'm doing it wrong. You've got
[4636.63s -> 4642.31s]  to wait till it comes in here. I've played these before. The best technique is seriously this one
[4642.31s -> 4647.03s]  right here. You wait until it's all the way out. Put one down to make it so it's flat. Guaranteed
[4647.03s -> 4663.42s]  flat. Sometimes you can get two. No more than that, though. Maybe three. Come on. That was a good one.
[4664.38s -> 4670.07s]  Get this left side. Don't neglect the right side either.
[4670.71s -> 4692.89s]  Burger Boy wouldn't have wanted this. He's not dead. This is not what Burger Boy would
[4692.89s -> 4706.26s]  have wanted if he were alive. This one is actually mindlessly fun. All right, let's go mindless.
[4709.66s -> 4723.72s]  Look at that wave coming in. This is what Burger Boy would have wanted. There it is.
[4724.44s -> 4738.76s]  I got some extra credits. Hold on. Make these ones count. All right. Yes. Good.
[4740.79s -> 4756.49s]  I got extra credits. Left side right here. I got one more shot right in the middle. Knock it down.
[4760.71s -> 4776.68s]  Look at that. It's so close. I get to keep going. This side right here. All right, that's probably it.
[4777.40s -> 4784.39s]  No, I get to keep going. Don't have to spend any more money. I beat my last record. 1,400.
[4786.84s -> 4798.94s]  Oh, shit. Any more? That's it. 16, 57. No, no, no. They're still pushing.
[4801.56s -> 4809.74s]  Mom, the creepy old man won't get off the coin game. Well, son, here's the thing about the creepy
[4809.74s -> 4817.77s]  old man. The creepy old man comes in here every day with $100 and allows the arcade to continue
[4817.77s -> 4823.61s]  to stay in business and lets them turn a potential profit for them to put another clock tower in the
[4823.61s -> 4835.94s]  game, in here, in the children casino. All right, here we go. Wait, I want to cash these in.
[4836.58s -> 4854.86s]  What am I at? 12, 14,876. I'm almost at the lightsaber. Lightsaber's 30.
[4859.21s -> 4862.94s]  Now, don't even look at these middle games yet. This one's still at 500.
[4868.31s -> 4886.49s]  Almost. You gonna run out of money? It's all right. I'll get some more.
[4893.75s -> 4900.41s]  It's 500 every time. This is the best way to farm tickets.
[4907.30s -> 4922.34s]  Building is on fire. Oh, I'm out of money. All right, I'm out of money. All right, back to the...
[4923.29s -> 4931.30s]  I need more money. Back to the money. Get that sparkler away from me. Yeah, I told you. You guys
[4931.30s -> 4940.55s]  thought I was going... acting crazy. Go play the check-in game? Not yet. Not yet. I still have to
[4940.55s -> 4949.30s]  experience all the new content. I don't have any money. Where's the money machine? Upstairs? All right.
[4954.36s -> 4972.97s]  I don't think I ever got the jackpot in the check-in game. I did not. I did? No. Yeah, no, I did. I did.
[4972.97s -> 4985.74s]  That's right. I did. Top right corner. No, right in front of the door. I did it twice? Yeah, it was
[4985.74s -> 5003.11s]  like five months ago. I don't remember. Top right. I got 75 bucks. Let me out. Where were we? Oh,
[5003.11s -> 5013.13s]  that's right. Butterfly drop. How does this one work? Collect... collect all six to win the bonus.
[5013.13s -> 5026.87s]  What's the bonus? Oh, you have to put... it's like the hockey one. I remember the hockey one.
[5027.43s -> 5040.41s]  This one's actually kind of hard. Get all the infinity stones. Oh, all right. This one...
[5041.30s -> 5047.18s]  those are about 50 tickets. This one could be pretty... this one could be pretty lucrative.
[5048.94s -> 5059.37s]  This one's bad. I mean, it's not the greatest game, but it doesn't mean it can't be lucrative.
[5060.33s -> 5082.22s]  Oh, shit. I missed. Oh, shit. This one sucks. Oh, this one sucks, but I have to get the bonus.
[5083.26s -> 5105.85s]  Get away from me. You're using the net upside down. I didn't even realize that till right now.
[5110.12s -> 5113.88s]  Depending... seriously, depending how lucrative the bonus is. I mean, we need to see it once.
[5114.52s -> 5150.02s]  How much is this? Two bucks? Holy shit. Is this even possible? This one sucked. Just, I know it
[5150.10s -> 5165.34s]  sucks, but we... we have to see what the bonus does. I'm already two in. Shake the table. No,
[5165.34s -> 5168.86s]  you can't shake anything unless you get thrown out. There it is. Okay, there's orange and pink.
[5168.86s -> 5175.38s]  Got them both. All right, now we need red, blue, and yellow. That's it. All right, we can wait for
[5175.38s -> 5183.88s]  this rotation because there's a... this is red. I might... I can get the blue. Got it. All right,
[5183.88s -> 5206.65s]  now red and yellow. That's it. Here it comes. I broke it up a little. I'm sorry. If this bonus
[5206.65s -> 5212.09s]  is less than 500, I'm never gonna play this one again. Don't worry. You don't have to worry
[5212.09s -> 5223.80s]  about that. Bingo. Yeah, I just need blue. Is it... where do you see 200? I don't see 200 anywhere.
[5224.44s -> 5241.42s]  I need red. All right, you guys didn't think there's gonna be 2,000 tickets for the bonus
[5241.42s -> 5248.94s]  here. That's a lot. That is a huge amount. That's a ridiculous amount, actually. So, I mean,
[5249.58s -> 5263.03s]  it's a lot. I feel like I could probably win the spaceship light machine thing four times before
[5263.03s -> 5274.09s]  I do this one. All right, let's move on. That is a good... that's a good grab, though. That's 2,000.
[5274.09s -> 5283.48s]  More than 2,000 tickets. All right, other side. We have... ooh, wormhole. This one looks cool.
[5284.28s -> 5289.26s]  Two dollars before credit. What, do you drop it through? Let's get a good look.
[5289.26s -> 5299.27s]  So you just... oh, it goes all the way around. We gotta count seconds here. Okay, let's see.
[5299.99s -> 5307.10s]  From this... from when I click the button. One, two, three. All right, it's about three and a
[5307.10s -> 5313.70s]  half seconds. So how long does it take to go around? Let's see. Jackpot, for instance. Ready?
[5315.78s -> 5326.76s]  One, two, three. All right, so ready? Check this out. I'll get it right here. Oh, I'm in the wrong
[5326.76s -> 5343.51s]  place. One, two. All right, it's right there. Do it again. You start counting at one. Why do you
[5343.51s -> 5351.61s]  start counting at one, not zero? No, because I'm not a weirdo. Zero, one. No, it's one, two, three.
[5351.61s -> 5364.95s]  Not zero, one, two. See? That's the terrible ones. Zero, one, two. No, it's one, two, three.
[5365.91s -> 5375.53s]  He's not a programmer. Who counts like that? Nobody counts one... nobody counts zero, one, two.
[5377.05s -> 5386.02s]  I'll try it. I'll try it. All right, I'll try it. I'll try it. That's the correct way. Zero is
[5386.02s -> 5408.49s]  a void. It's not even a real number. Zero. No. Zero, one, two. It's close. Zero, one, two.
[5408.49s -> 5422.81s]  Two. That's literally untrue. Zero, one, one, zero. Zero, one, two.
[5427.26s -> 5438.90s]  So it works sometimes. Zero, one, two. All right, maybe I'll change the way I count numbers now.
[5439.46s -> 5454.47s]  Give me my tickets. That kid's gonna... look at how many burn marks are all over this kid.
[5456.74s -> 5465.38s]  What? He's got like... you're messed up. We're gonna find where your parents are.
[5466.81s -> 5471.88s]  Leave him alone. Well, what do you want me to do? He's holding it so close to his face,
[5471.88s -> 5486.54s]  he's burning his face. Here we go. This is the one I'm talking about. Cow machine. First try,
[5486.54s -> 5494.55s]  get it. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean this whole machine out. That's why you don't play this game
[5494.55s -> 5506.25s]  ever. That's why I don't... this thing grips as hard as your grandmother. Your grandmother
[5506.25s -> 5525.78s]  has a real soft grip. You got to distribute the weight. I get it. Don't grab the head. No,
[5525.78s -> 5530.94s]  no, no. You don't grab the head. You got to grab right in the chest. Right along the chest or
[5530.94s -> 5539.69s]  distribute the weight. That's not the chest, but I... no. I gotta get chest. There it is. It's lined
[5539.69s -> 5549.13s]  up perfectly. Just got to get it right in the... right there where the weight is distributed.
[5549.93s -> 5556.54s]  If this ain't it, this is impossible. Look at that distributed weight.
[5557.10s -> 5563.34s]  Come on. It's... what? No, no, no. I want to play it. I want...
[5566.65s -> 5575.24s]  How am I supposed to do this? It's right in the chest. Right in the sternum. There it is.
[5576.78s -> 5583.77s]  Get it over there. It's... you can't... it won't... it can't move. So how is it even possible?
[5584.49s -> 5612.42s]  I didn't get anything. It's rigged. No, it's a motion problem. Get it. All right,
[5612.42s -> 5625.30s]  that's a pretty good grip. It's impossible. You need to just toss it over here accidentally somehow.
[5626.02s -> 5641.72s]  That might be it. All right. Accident. Nice. Pretty good accident. I got one. Cool. Let's
[5641.72s -> 5665.21s]  get another one. Let's get one so we can give it to somebody here. Throw it on the racetrack.
[5665.21s -> 5680.55s]  Why would I waste a perfectly good cow throwing it on a racetrack? Why would I waste it? That's
[5680.55s -> 5689.11s]  the one. That's a perfect grab. What? That doesn't even make any sense. The cow just struggled and
[5689.11s -> 5700.89s]  got out. You have to actually throw it in like it did last time. Quick, get the Pikachu socks.
[5702.36s -> 5707.82s]  They're right there. I already got one, so it doesn't matter, but I'm gonna try.
[5711.77s -> 5730.30s]  Stop moving around so much. Settle. Settle. Settle. Why is it not settling? Throw it in there. Toss it.
[5730.30s -> 5733.50s]  Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw it in. Throw it in. Throw it in.
[5734.46s -> 5755.59s]  That's two. Oh, that was almost a free one. That was almost for free. Do it again. He's addicted.
[5755.59s -> 5766.14s]  Addicted to mega milk. Oh, I see. You're doing it. All right. I see what you mean. He's
[5766.14s -> 5776.22s]  addicted. He's addicted. I want to try to get one for free. We need a good bounce on the free one.
[5780.63s -> 5786.14s]  This is a cute game though. Go for the closest one. Well, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying
[5786.14s -> 5795.45s]  to make a pile. Derma's going to be here for four hours. No, no, no, no, no. More like four minutes.
[5796.33s -> 5815.86s]  Get it in. It's almost there. Grab it from the butt and then I should be able to toss it in there.
[5817.91s -> 5822.55s]  No, didn't get it. I just have to grab it. No, I have to push it in the head. I'm going to push
[5822.55s -> 5838.15s]  its head down. You know what I'm saying? Maybe it'll bump it in. Get it in there. Yes. Another one.
[5838.15s -> 5852.71s]  I want more. I wonder how much these sell for. Oh my god. I did it again. Another one. I want more.
[5854.15s -> 5875.93s]  I got to move some of these over this way. Let's try this guy right here. Right in the head. Got it.
[5888.36s -> 5904.78s]  I'm being such an asshole. Get your presents, man. I want to fill it to the brim
[5905.82s -> 5917.59s]  and then sell them. I want to turn. Wait. You just have to wait because I'm currently
[5918.23s -> 5925.24s]  getting all of them. These probably sell for like a hundred bucks each at least.
[5925.96s -> 5937.11s]  I'm on a roll. Yeah. What happens if I get them all? Can I get them all? Will they just stack up
[5937.11s -> 5951.37s]  over here and I can open the floodgates and have just a bunch of cows fly out? Some of them are
[5951.37s -> 5957.26s]  impossible to get though because of where they're located. Is this why Derma decided to move to
[5957.26s -> 5979.86s]  Las Vegas? For claw machines? So you're holding up the line here. That's all right. Get the first
[5979.86s -> 5987.30s]  one you tried. This one is ready to go. Just need to get it right in the chest. Right here.
[5987.30s -> 5995.91s]  There it is. Go around. There we go. Get the blue one in the back. Blue? That's not in here.
[5998.65s -> 6006.14s]  That's the background. Mario says it's time for someone else to play.
[6007.02s -> 6011.48s]  And then you just skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip as fast as you can so you hope nobody saw it.
[6012.63s -> 6024.78s]  They did. They all did. Is there something else buried in here?
[6032.46s -> 6040.66s]  What? The mod's doing a good job stopping copy and pasting trolls.
[6042.33s -> 6056.76s]  Yeah, good. So see you later. See you next time. Is it just, is it so much to ask to want to fill
[6056.76s -> 6078.26s]  this up and just turn around and just flex? Throw it in. I tell you, it's almost, okay, okay, okay,
[6078.26s -> 6082.90s]  okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Ready? Watch.
[6083.86s -> 6093.10s]  There it is. Oh, I'm so excited. I'm almost as excited for sorting algorithms.
[6113.53s -> 6116.25s]  All right. I'm gonna get one more in there. One more and then I'm gonna open it up and
[6116.25s -> 6123.08s]  then I'm gonna turn around and be like, have at it, kids. And they're all gonna be like, yeah.
[6123.08s -> 6140.30s]  You're gonna make a, you're just making a riot? No. What? Does it count as a win if I pick the
[6140.30s -> 6152.70s]  one up that's right there and drop it over the sensor? I'm sure it does. I just have to get one
[6152.70s -> 6158.14s]  more in here and that's it. Look, I went over the double dare line. Okay. I put enough milk in there
[6158.14s -> 6170.65s]  to win the family challenge. Hold on. But I want to do more. I just want one more and then I'm done.
[6170.65s -> 6174.81s]  I won't have to play it again. Just want one more. I want to go so far over it that it's just like a
[6174.81s -> 6181.77s]  joke. Like, holy shit, man. What overkill is this? You did it. You won. But I want to make sure that
[6181.77s -> 6189.13s]  no one else gets to win as much as I did. I want to be on the leaderboard over there. All right.
[6189.13s -> 6206.62s]  Good. It's in a good spot. Cow leaderboard. Come on. I did it.
[6209.51s -> 6215.88s]  It's as many as it could possibly go in there. Let's go in. Let's see what we can get. I wonder
[6215.88s -> 6235.54s]  if I win. Did I win? Oh, wow. I won. See the real evil mastermind here thing to do.
[6237.08s -> 6240.04s]  Beat it. Whip out some super glue in like super glue. The door shut.
[6241.00s -> 6248.90s]  So it's like, there's prizes right there. We can't get them. The prizes are right there.
[6260.34s -> 6274.18s]  You evil, evil man. Jeremy, you need to let go. Oh yeah. I said I was going to stop after that.
[6274.74s -> 6280.22s]  It's all right. Yeah. That's a cartoon villain scheme. All right. I'm out.
[6281.18s -> 6305.78s]  Let's get our prizes here. Oh, no. The prizes are right there. I can't get them.
[6307.22s -> 6323.75s]  Oh, what are you doing? What the hell is it doing? Can I go in and reach my hand in there?
[6325.24s -> 6329.67s]  Wait, hold on. I have to just jostle. I have to just move. Yep. There it is. Okay.
[6330.47s -> 6336.39s]  No, no, no. Don't pick it up. I want to get out. I want to get out. I don't want to pick that up.
[6341.13s -> 6354.07s]  All right. I can try this one. This one's like right here. All right. That's it. That's it.
[6354.07s -> 6367.42s]  It's not softlocked. I can pull these ones out. Look, there are a couple. There are a couple that
[6367.42s -> 6384.06s]  are softlocked, but I can get them. See, I just have to pay money. No, I don't. Jeremy,
[6384.06s -> 6387.74s]  what are you doing? I'm just trying. I don't want to waste the money. I might as well try to grab one.
[6389.91s -> 6401.53s]  All right. That's good. They're both ready. All right. I beat the cow machine. Cool.
[6402.65s -> 6405.69s]  Uh, what do we have? Oh, there's more in the middle. All right. Hold on.
[6405.69s -> 6412.92s]  Why don't we have tickets? Get all of them. You don't really think I'm going to sit there
[6412.92s -> 6423.11s]  and get every single cow in that machine. Why on earth would I do that? Let's check my inventory.
[6425.02s -> 6432.07s]  Good. One, two, three. All right. Cool. I didn't despawn. I have them. Oh, I want to get a Mr.
[6432.07s -> 6435.11s]  Potato Head. How do I do this? All right. Right. It's from the middle. I can get one of these. I
[6435.11s -> 6452.39s]  just have to win. I have 20,000 tickets. I need 80,000 more. Do this one first. Okay.
[6455.06s -> 6469.19s]  You can only count to three. I don't have coins. What are you talking about? Oh.
[6469.75s -> 6483.30s]  Hey, I have something for you. This is for you. Come here. This is less dangerous.
[6484.18s -> 6494.76s]  Get over here. I have something. This is for you. This is for you. It's less dangerous. Here.
[6494.76s -> 6506.94s]  Oh, he fell downstairs and he hit his mouth. Oh, I'm sorry about that, kid. I'm sorry. He's running.
[6511.74s -> 6524.25s]  Even though when a kid, when like somebody cries, it's like, it gets louder. Yes.
[6528.34s -> 6534.55s]  You're mocking him. I remember when I used to cry. I would do this thing. And a lot of people do
[6534.55s -> 6542.52s]  this when something happens. That's so traumatic. Something like, Oh, I bumped my hand and it hurt.
[6543.40s -> 6547.88s]  You start instantly crying insanely hard, but you said no noise is coming up.
[6548.52s -> 6567.40s]  So you have this face like this. Should I turn the camera on for this? So you have this face,
[6567.40s -> 6579.29s]  right? That looks like this. Like princess bumped my hand real hard. Ready? Like, and then crying
[6579.29s -> 6597.77s]  happens. Sometimes it's, it's really delayed. Here comes an edit. Who cares? Nice hair hippie.
[6597.77s -> 6605.58s]  Ban that person for life, please. And you can always tell like, Oh, oh no, you like bumped your
[6605.58s -> 6617.54s]  knee. Oh shit. Oh, here I, oh, oh, here. I see that face and like it's, oh, it's, you know, it's
[6617.54s -> 6651.27s]  coming. You have good here. Hey, thanks. Three in a row, three in a row, three in a row and I get,
[6651.27s -> 6670.30s]  and I get a thousand subs. Oh, too bad. All right. Three in a row, three in a row, I get a thousand
[6670.30s -> 6680.86s]  subs. If I don't get three in a row, then I, I don't say that part. I don't want to say the next
[6680.86s -> 6715.64s]  part. I don't want to say the next part. That's too unreliable. Ghost pepper? No. Got it. Three in a
[6715.64s -> 6732.86s]  row and I get a thousand subs. Not three in a row. I eat a ghost pepper. Oh, all right. Double
[6732.86s -> 6738.46s]  or nothing. If I get another, I get four in a row, I get 2,000 subs. Okay. Five and five or
[6738.46s -> 6751.86s]  nothing. If I, I'll eat 10 ghost peppers on stream or 10,000 subs. Oh shit. Oh, gambling.
[6751.86s -> 6775.62s]  God damn it. I should have just, I should have just stopped there. That was a lot of subs. He's
[6775.62s -> 6783.99s]  going to chase this high. Oh, there they are. They're the subs. 10. Nice. I just got 10. 10,000
[6783.99s -> 6794.28s]  subs right there by cold war hall. Oh my God. 10,000 subs. You actually did it. I lost too.
[6795.50s -> 6806.26s]  That's a lot. 10,000 subs. Gifted. Holy shit. That's, how much money would that be? That's 50.
[6808.34s -> 6813.35s]  That's insane. Imagine that. Don't imagine that because that's never going to happen. So don't
[6813.35s -> 6818.71s]  worry. Dude. Oh dude. Coke. Coke. No, don't, I can't say that. If I say that, that's like,
[6819.43s -> 6824.81s]  I don't want to like slander a company. Oh, another 10,000 subs from you guys. That's
[6824.81s -> 6844.01s]  20,000 subs. 10,000 from Antfork. Thank you. Holy shit. Zero. One. Two.
[6847.78s -> 6862.86s]  Still good enough. You can do a little slander. Oh, Jerma sucks. Thanks to the 5,000 community subs.
[6863.66s -> 6875.56s]  You guys are really doing, you guys are going hard. Three in a row. I get 50,000 gifted subs.
[6875.56s -> 6888.71s]  If I don't get three in a row, I will, I will try, I will try my hardest to eat a one small,
[6888.71s -> 6901.50s]  a four by four piece of plywood. I get, I did it. I don't even know what that one was for.
[6901.50s -> 6906.38s]  I don't know what that one was for. That one's for something too. That one's for, that's another
[6906.38s -> 6938.52s]  50 million subs. I got a, I got a lot of tickets. Ghost pepper plywood. Jamie, thanks for the 5,000
[6938.52s -> 6948.97s]  community subs. Appreciate that. All right. I have 25,000 tickets. I'm, I just have enough
[6948.97s -> 6966.71s]  for the lightsaber. Let's do this one. Trick with these, you got to stay in the middle.
[6968.10s -> 6972.31s]  Stay right in the middle and you have access to all of them. Say, I know some of you,
[6972.31s -> 6980.04s]  some of you gamers that play this, you'll go like this. Oh, I missed. Oh shit. Stay in the middle.
[6980.04s -> 7042.54s]  Check this. All right. What's the, what's the score? I didn't see he was green. What? What?
[7043.34s -> 7061.99s]  Here we go. Oh, he lost his touch. Oh shit. I lost my touch. All right. Here we go. Here we go.
[7061.99s -> 7067.13s]  This is the one. This is the one coming up. All right. If I get, I get three in a row, then I,
[7068.25s -> 7072.97s]  I sub to a ghost pepper. And if I get, if I don't get three in a row, I eat 10,000 community subs.
[7073.85s -> 7092.28s]  I meant, I, whatever. I'm going to eat these subs now. That's the best tickets,
[7092.28s -> 7100.98s]  pound for pound. We got one more game to play. Tiny. Thanks for the 8,000 subs. Appreciate it.
[7101.70s -> 7107.26s]  Loose Cane. Thanks for 5,000 subs. Thank you guys. Seriously. Wow. A lot of fucking money.
[7108.14s -> 7121.51s]  My God. 5,000 subs. What? What the fuck? What are you doing? What are you thinking? What? What?
[7122.47s -> 7133.85s]  Hold on. How many subs was that? 50,000 community subs? Oh, oh, what? No way.
[7134.65s -> 7146.30s]  Who game? Whoa. 50,000. That's like 10 times. That's 10, 10 incomes. What the heck? All right.
[7146.30s -> 7162.81s]  Somebody actually just did it. What? Somebody just gave 50 subs. All right. That's enough. You did,
[7163.05s -> 7169.11s]  you just covered, you just covered everybody. Thank you. Raggle flaggle for the actually 50
[7169.11s -> 7174.17s]  community subs. Appreciate that. That's actually 50,000 community subs. Thank you for that. That's
[7174.17s -> 7185.26s]  a lot of subs. A lot of them. A lot of people dodged. Come on. What an asshole streamer. What?
[7186.87s -> 7197.51s]  That is actually a lot of money. Seriously. Thank you. Why am I an asshole? Because I was
[7197.51s -> 7209.69s]  doing the what? No, that happened before that. I, I, I cut that joke off right now. And I was
[7209.69s -> 7215.85s]  thanking the person for real for 50 and the five. I was, I was doing tuber. You guys know the drill.
[7219.05s -> 7225.50s]  He's doing a fake reaction, but it didn't even happen. Grimmy sensation. Thanks to the five
[7225.50s -> 7230.86s]  subs. What's seriously, uh, waggle waggle. What's your name? I want to get it right. You just gave
[7230.86s -> 7244.31s]  us a ton of money. Raggle flaggle. 50 community subs. Thank you. We need to get all the SpongeBob
[7244.31s -> 7268.58s]  cards. I know this one. Oh, this is, I love this too. Can I get two? Uh, I gotta get in the flow.
[7268.58s -> 7271.46s]  I have to get in the flow, get in the flow. I'm going to do like a hundred dollars in this.
[7273.06s -> 7285.34s]  Peculiar. Pangolin. Thanks for the five community subs. More subs. What? I got two. What? What
[7285.34s -> 7289.90s]  happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Back up. I got him. I got Mr. Potato. It's over
[7289.90s -> 7305.77s]  there. When did I get that? I didn't get, did I get all eight cards? I didn't see it. Did I get
[7305.77s -> 7321.80s]  another Pete? Holy shit. I don't even know what this is. Wait, what are you, what are you linking?
[7322.44s -> 7332.60s]  Link, link, link, link, link, link. Where are my teeth? Why did you take my teeth out of that?
[7332.60s -> 7346.95s]  I don't understand. All right. I got, I like, this one's fun.
[7355.34s -> 7364.74s]  Show the picture. I don't, I'm playing a game. Look at that eye. Those eyes are real, right? Link,
[7364.74s -> 7372.09s]  link, link. I know. I see it. You guys can't fool me anymore because now I just assume everything
[7372.09s -> 7395.78s]  is fake. Here, I'll put it on screen. Here. You want to see? Here you go. Here's what everybody
[7395.78s -> 7415.86s]  is laughing about in here. There it is. All right. Those two images have the same energy though.
[7429.05s -> 7435.59s]  Now what? No, I'm not putting that one on stream. I hate that picture. That picture scares the shit
[7435.59s -> 7442.38s]  out of me. I hate that one. I'll keep this one here, but that one is, I hate that picture more
[7442.38s -> 7461.83s]  than anything. That face you make when you get 50,000 subs. No, this is the face you make when
[7461.83s -> 7469.27s]  the shower is too cold when you get in. What? It was running for like two minutes. What the fuck?
[7469.99s -> 7484.70s]  There you go. No, I'm not putting, I'm not putting that image on screen. I'm sorry. I'm
[7484.70s -> 7491.08s]  going to give everybody nightmares because it's scaring me. I hate that picture. That is, I hate
[7491.08s -> 7498.84s]  it. I hate everything about that picture. It's the worst picture in the world. No, I refuse to put that
[7498.84s -> 7518.74s]  on stream. Nobody deserves to have to see that. How many tickets do I have? Free, free play.
[7521.99s -> 7523.59s]  I want to get the card on the right.
[7527.42s -> 7535.78s]  Get in there. Here they come. No, worst possible opportunity.
[7544.25s -> 7550.28s]  Come on, big push. Oh yeah. What was it? Why was I faking that reaction?
[7558.65s -> 7580.28s]  No, I'm not clicking any more of these. I'm trying to win a hoverboard. Get that card in there.
[7582.30s -> 7596.50s]  Show the fucking picture. Jesus. Jesus Christ. Why do I click this? There's so many in here.
[7598.26s -> 7601.62s]  Do you see how many photos are in here right now? No, I'm not going to link the Dunkin Donuts
[7601.62s -> 7616.20s]  gift card. We've seen that. It's funny. Okay. I'm serious right now. You, this is one of those
[7616.20s -> 7621.40s]  images that you're never going to unsee. You're going to look at this and it's going to,
[7622.36s -> 7629.38s]  you're not going to like this because I don't like it. And it kind of hurts my head. So just warning,
[7629.38s -> 7632.82s]  look away from the screen right now. If you actually don't want to never have this image
[7632.82s -> 7657.30s]  get out of your head for the rest of your life. All right. I did it. Oh, it's on my other monitor.
[7657.30s -> 7685.35s]  Get it off. You look like a bug. I got a bonus. I just want this card on the right and I can be
[7685.35s -> 7696.01s]  done and I can go scratch lottery tickets. What do you mean wrong one? No, that's just an edited
[7696.01s -> 7702.54s]  version. That was not, that one's not even as bad. That's like a typical scary image of like a scary
[7702.54s -> 7716.89s]  monster. That's not, show it then. Nah, I'm superstitious. I don't, I don't show pictures
[7716.89s -> 7745.42s]  of demons. Get in there. I haven't hit one. How am I this bad? Come on, give me that purple card.
[7745.42s -> 7762.58s]  That's all I want. Get it. Oh, yeah. Oh, spooky. That's spooky. Where's the 2000?
[7762.58s -> 7774.47s]  Did somebody steal my 2000 tickets? What is this bullshit? All right. I was at the hoverboard
[7775.51s -> 7784.09s]  30% of the way to the hoverboard. Let's go. You ready? You know what machine I'm going to use.
[7791.26s -> 7802.84s]  30%. Wait, does anybody know if I have to get them all here? Or can I get them from another,
[7803.40s -> 7809.13s]  I almost said restaurant. You don't? Okay. Well, I'm going to do this. I'm going to get like
[7809.13s -> 7828.02s]  10,000 more from this. Do this 10 times. What? I don't have any money. God damn it. All right.
[7828.02s -> 7831.06s]  We're going to go to the other arcade. I'm going to refresh my memory on the other games.
[7831.62s -> 7845.70s]  It's time for lottery tickets? No, not yet. Not till I have my hoverboard. Do I have to take the
[7845.70s -> 7854.46s]  bus again? Go play the bass game? Yeah, I could do that too. Wait, I want to mount and do. Oh,
[7854.46s -> 7863.82s]  sorry. Not add whatever it is a Danny DeVito or something. Oh, that's not either. Whatever.
[7866.22s -> 7894.92s]  What was last time you guys drank a Mountain Dew? They gross for some reason to be Mountain Dew.
[7894.92s -> 7901.37s]  Just regular Mountain Dew tastes like there's too much syrup in it. It's almost like you
[7901.37s -> 7907.61s]  melted a bunch of lemon lime popsicles and put it over ice and added a little bit of water. It's
[7908.09s -> 7920.18s]  something about it. Did they change the recipe? Why don't I drink diet? Because drinking diet
[7920.18s -> 7935.50s]  anything is not really that great for you. The shit that they put in diet soda is really not good
[7935.50s -> 7942.50s]  for you. They put like aspartame in that shit. You don't want to be drinking that. We've come
[7942.50s -> 7950.82s]  up with a chemical that tastes sort of like sugar in a way. It also can cause a bunch of diseases.
[7950.82s -> 7974.14s]  This is not in my car. That's fake news. Fake news at aspartame? A recent published review
[7974.14s -> 7978.46s]  of all available evidence including hundreds of studies concluded the studies provide no evidence
[7978.46s -> 7996.01s]  to support an association between aspartame and can't whatever. No, that's the fake news. Is it?
[7996.73s -> 8006.84s]  Did I just get fake newsed? Fake newsed? Did I just get fake news brackets fake newsed? Did I? No.
[8006.84s -> 8020.65s]  Did that happen to me? I can't trust anything. What happened? Aspartame is one of the most
[8020.65s -> 8024.01s]  controversial sweeteners in the world. It is claimed to cause health problems ranging from
[8024.01s -> 8028.01s]  headaches to cancer. On the other hand, food safety authorities and other mainstream sources
[8028.01s -> 8037.66s]  consider it to be safe. Who can you believe? The truth about aspartame. Is aspartame really dangerous?
[8039.03s -> 8045.90s]  Is aspartame a carcinogen? What are the long-term effects of aspartame? Dizziness, depression,
[8045.90s -> 8053.11s]  headaches, Alzheimer's. Does aspartame cause inflammation? It's too much info. Your body
[8053.11s -> 8055.99s]  cannot process artificial ingredients well, so substances like aspartame and
[8055.99s -> 8062.65s]  monosodium glutamate may trigger immune responses. That's too many angles. Too many people. Too many
[8062.65s -> 8070.04s]  studies. I have an anti-study. I have a study that's, but what about my study? What's going on?
[8070.04s -> 8093.05s]  It's too deep. Fake news. Fake news. MSG is safe. I know, but there's, I don't know. Here's the thing.
[8093.05s -> 8099.37s]  I've heard the story about MSG that one guy was mad at some restaurant and he made like a hit piece
[8099.37s -> 8113.05s]  on it, right? Something like that. I remember, right? Somebody was like, I got a headache.
[8115.10s -> 8120.22s]  It has to be from the MSG and not the pack of cigarettes I smoke every day. Of course not.
[8121.74s -> 8125.10s]  I don't know. It's too many things. There's too many things to know. Too many things to read about.
[8132.54s -> 8153.19s]  Long story short, eat a banana. Why is there a giant surge protector out here? It's for the robots.
[8155.24s -> 8165.58s]  Uh, what does it say? Islandville Power Authority authorized personnel only. Bananas actually cause
[8165.58s -> 8170.87s]  you to die, unfortunately. Guys, I guarantee you there's a study for every single substance that's
[8170.87s -> 8178.17s]  ever been invented of why you shouldn't be eating it or drinking it. Studies have shown that if you
[8178.17s -> 8191.99s]  eat too many bananas, it's going to cause you a potassium overdose. Okay. Is cheese the reason
[8191.99s -> 8215.34s]  why you got a bad score on your SATs? Click here. I have enough for a ticket, right? I remember
[8215.34s -> 8222.36s]  reading, uh, so everyone's seen that ad and there was a, there was a, somebody wrote an article about
[8222.36s -> 8228.92s]  this one particular ad. You guys have probably seen it. It's the doctors found this one food
[8228.92s -> 8238.84s]  that you should never eat. And the image is a bunch of tapeworms and worms in an intestinal track,
[8238.84s -> 8246.70s]  right? And this person wrote an article about how they clicked on it and they went searching
[8246.70s -> 8251.85s]  for this doctor. It was actually a pretty interesting read. I forget what the article was,
[8251.85s -> 8273.64s]  but go read it. It was pretty interesting. Is aspartame bat poop? I hate that ad. Advertisements
[8273.64s -> 8280.47s]  just make no sense. We live in such a strange world where somebody can just buy ad space
[8281.19s -> 8289.08s]  and just write just total dog shit and whatever. Doctors found this one thing that makes you live
[8289.08s -> 8296.62s]  over a hundred. It does? Yeah. Okay. What is it? Uh, subscribe to this magazine that has nothing
[8296.62s -> 8303.16s]  to do with anything that we ever told you. What? I want to know the fucking nutrient that makes me
[8303.16s -> 8312.65s]  live forever. Oh, well, um, well, I don't even know what you're talking about. What the fuck?
[8312.65s -> 8331.03s]  What is that even talking about? I can't believe you can just say anything. Ads work, unfortunately.
[8332.49s -> 8336.49s]  Wait, I remember this one. Wait, let's get out here. Out, out, out, out, out. I want to get out.
[8336.49s -> 8348.90s]  I want to go to the carnival again because there's other games here. What happened to the audio?
[8348.90s -> 8381.45s]  That was fast. Where is the audio? Oh, there it is. Hi. I'm here for your games. By the way.
[8381.45s -> 8389.42s]  Nevermind. No, I don't want rides. No, no rides. Get them out. I don't want them. I've already read
[8389.42s -> 8395.02s]  all these. I want to play the carnival games. There we go. A coin pusher. No, this is just for
[8395.02s -> 8408.10s]  prizes. This isn't for tickets. I'm leaving. Was that here before? Was it Ferris wheel here?
[8415.64s -> 8426.58s]  Yes. Oh, okay. I have to wait 20 minutes for the next bus. No, I don't. It comes immediately. Ads.
[8429.72s -> 8436.90s]  Ad companies are so fun. Not, not fun. Like funny. I mean, I didn't, I didn't finish my sentence
[8436.90s -> 8443.70s]  because this guy was driving erratically. Uh, they, first there's a pre-roll ad and
[8444.26s -> 8446.98s]  people have found a way. Ad companies have found a way to make it because, you know,
[8446.98s -> 8451.30s]  they know you're going to skip. So they just front load a ton of info in the first five seconds
[8451.30s -> 8457.14s]  and they've paid for 30 second ads, but they just front load everything in the first five seconds.
[8457.14s -> 8470.26s]  In the last 25 seconds don't even matter. It's just, they just added film time. Skippable ads
[8470.26s -> 8482.01s]  are cheaper. That's true. Still have to pay. Still going to pay for that 30 second slot. It
[8482.01s -> 8500.84s]  might be a little bit cheaper. Is it going to be Germacraft today? Uh, no. Where's the bus? Oh,
[8500.84s -> 8508.98s]  I have to call the bus. Whoops. We want ads. We already went over this. There's no reason
[8508.98s -> 8513.46s]  for you to play ads on this stream. And there's no reason for anyone to give a shit about ads
[8514.10s -> 8520.25s]  that's ever streams or ever maybe on YouTube because I say, I don't know. If I run an ad,
[8520.25s -> 8525.61s]  75% of you are not going to see it. Half of you have ad block. Half of you may be subbed.
[8526.63s -> 8537.62s]  If I run an ad like 20, I'm just making like 400 of you's lives miserable. I'm pretty close
[8537.62s -> 8548.02s]  to the edge there. Run it in stream. See, that's the way to get around it. But that's,
[8549.40s -> 8561.14s]  I, why would I do that? That's the quickest way to delete a bunch of people that are currently
[8561.14s -> 8570.74s]  watching. All right. Where are we going? Uh, Larry's arcade, right? I need a hundred thousand
[8570.74s -> 8582.54s]  tickets. Next Barry's pond. All right. I'm going to get off at Barry's pond. I have a lot of cows to
[8582.54s -> 8597.90s]  sell. Actually just play Raid Shadow Legends on stream. Do that. There are, there are no pros to
[8597.90s -> 8612.30s]  that. There's only cons. I can't think of more than one potential pro to that. That would be
[8612.30s -> 8620.20s]  a funny stream for maybe five minutes. And then I'm playing Raid Shadow Legends on stream. I
[8625.29s -> 8643.29s]  use other door. You played numbers go, Jesus Christ. What is this? What? Hold on. Somebody
[8643.29s -> 8673.27s]  just left a car. Who left a scratch ticket out here? I want eight bucks. Where's the other door?
[8677.67s -> 8684.74s]  Where's the use the other door? Oh, they're talking about the on the left. What the that's
[8686.34s -> 8704.98s]  all right. Let's get it in there. How much is one of these worth? Five dollars.
[8705.70s -> 8770.23s]  Oh, that's not worth it. I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I'll go get him.
[8770.23s -> 8788.57s]  He's right here. He's right here. I'm sorry. I'll never do that again. I'm sorry. I'll never do it
[8788.57s -> 8826.14s]  again. Whose house is this? Run his head over. Holy shit. Wow, we found the psycho. It's me? No,
[8826.14s -> 8848.28s]  it's not. I didn't say that. Whose house is this? My house now. Is it? Is it my house? This goes
[8848.28s -> 8854.31s]  from being a fun arcade game to being really scary. Who's this dude outside shining a flashlight in
[8854.31s -> 8866.04s]  our windows? They're casing our house. Okay, I can't get in here. Where's my house? There's no door.
[8866.60s -> 8877.18s]  This game has slender energy. You're robbing a house for arcade money.
[8877.74s -> 8885.67s]  I don't even know where the hell I'm going. I guess we're going to check out that house.
[8885.67s -> 8896.04s]  I was supposed to go to the other arcade. Is it? Can I go in that house? Look at the map.
[8899.22s -> 8906.95s]  All right. Where am I? Bus stop. What is that? Home. What about my? Oh, shit. About my limo.
[8910.89s -> 8933.59s]  I really am a rich kid. Did he go over the edge? He just drove off the cliff.
[8938.54s -> 8949.00s]  Oh, well, sorry. Where's the basketball? I know you can play it. You have to. All right. I forgot.
[8949.00s -> 8959.43s]  Here's my achievements. Cool. Here's my fucking gamer fridge that I have behind me.
[8960.23s -> 8984.84s]  Why do I have a giant map of the town? That's weird. Sell your gamer fridge. Who the fuck is
[8984.84s -> 9016.47s]  this? Angel duck. This duck food? Come get your food. What the hell is going on? Oh, the duck eats?
[9019.83s -> 9042.50s]  How do you pet duck? Can you pet duck? I want to pet the duck. Force choke.
[9056.10s -> 9066.87s]  He's all right. Is he? Yes, he's fine. Mommy's little angel.
[9070.09s -> 9077.29s]  Ducks don't sleep. Wait. 105th annual swan goose show. Swim contest. Best feathers. Loudest quack.
[9077.29s -> 9084.17s]  Featuring special guest. 2028 grand champion. Gary from Islandville. 20 dollar autographs.
[9084.17s -> 9094.70s]  That's Gary. He's famous. Mainland arena. May 5th. 25 dollar general admission. He's famous.
[9099.30s -> 9114.17s]  Wow. You actually have a duck. That's so cool. All right. Don't overfeed Gary. I was going to
[9114.17s -> 9120.04s]  put food in the blender. I can't microwave his food or my food. Can I eat that food?
[9131.99s -> 9146.54s]  This is awesome. Pawn Gary. You can't. Why would I pawn Gary? We're just like hanging out together.
[9148.94s -> 9152.94s]  I'm not force choking Gary. We're walking around together.
[9158.89s -> 9177.08s]  You're hurting him. I'm not hurting him. Look, we're hanging out in bed. Oops. Sorry, Gary. Wait.
[9180.23s -> 9195.48s]  No. I want to hang out with you. This is my room. Cool. Can I use that? This definitely was not here
[9195.48s -> 9208.89s]  the last time I played. You have an entire house. I can't. Can I go to the bathroom?
[9209.45s -> 9233.72s]  That's a nice shower. Turn off the lights and go upstairs. Okay. Put Gary in toilet. Now,
[9233.72s -> 9244.49s]  that's something I'm not going to do. I need to turn the lights off. Was the lights switched
[9244.49s -> 9257.88s]  from here? It should be right here. What happened to it? Oh, hey. Excuse me. Excuse me. You're
[9257.88s -> 9269.80s]  blocking the way. Go up or down. Come on, Gary. Where's the light? There's no lights. Oh, here we
[9269.80s -> 9330.01s]  go. Ooh, Gary. Gary. Fuck. All right. Bye, Gary. It was fun hanging out with you. That's kind of
[9330.01s -> 9340.17s]  a cool thing. You have a house. You missed a room. Double D. What? Double D. Where? Put Gary in your
[9340.17s -> 9346.46s]  inventory. I can't put Gary in my inventory. He doesn't go in there. In the bathroom. What do
[9346.46s -> 9352.68s]  you mean? How could there be another room in the bathroom? Don't hit Gary with the flashlight.
[9354.68s -> 9372.23s]  Gary, what are you doing in here? What do you want? Hi. Yes. Yes. Move. We need to give you a bath.
[9375.50s -> 9382.38s]  How do you give a duck a bath if they're in your... Give them a bath. No, ducks bathe themselves,
[9382.38s -> 9395.78s]  guys. Yeah, ducks bathe themselves. They bathe themselves. You don't wash a duck. You don't like,
[9395.78s -> 9401.06s]  oh, I put you in a bathtub with soap and water. No, no, no. A duck just goes to water and they
[9401.06s -> 9408.30s]  smash their face into it and roll and they throw their head up in the air. I've seen it. Where's
[9408.30s -> 9415.42s]  this other room you're talking about? They put their head underwater. They swish their face around
[9415.42s -> 9420.38s]  and they put their face in the air and they go... They go like this. You never seen a duck bathe
[9420.38s -> 9429.13s]  before? Here's the duck's arm, right? This is the duck's arm. No, this is the duck's face. Yes. Hi.
[9429.13s -> 9433.61s]  How are you? Good to see you. This is the duck's face. They go under. Let's say that this line
[9433.61s -> 9439.69s]  in here is the water level. Yes, and we're talking about you. Yes. When they go under...
[9441.61s -> 9447.45s]  Okay, he's funny. When they go under, they... Yeah, go ahead and do it. When they go under,
[9447.45s -> 9453.10s]  they go boom, under the water, up and they go... They drink the water on their heads. They go...
[9453.10s -> 9461.48s]  They go... Very good job. That's exactly what they do. Yes, you're... Oh, yes, you're...
[9462.76s -> 9467.56s]  Good. Okay. Yes, you just wanted to kiss me. Okay, good. I see. Yeah, he's doing very good.
[9483.43s -> 9490.25s]  Where's the door that you're talking about? Do I not even have cable?
[9493.05s -> 9516.31s]  Wait, are you... We watch... Oh, we watch TV together? There's nothing on TV, Gary. It's his
[9516.39s -> 9536.47s]  favorite show. Hey, what? Did he just try to turn it back on? It's back... Gary, it's back on.
[9537.59s -> 9578.98s]  Your favorite show is back on. White screen. Don't you like it? Yes, I love this show. Hey,
[9578.98s -> 9595.58s]  I was... I was watching that. Gary, to the left of the fridge. Oh, there is another door here.
[9595.58s -> 9608.92s]  You can't go in this door. Thanks for the bait. All right, I gotta go win more tickets before...
[9608.92s -> 9619.67s]  I need 30... I need 70,000 more tickets. I can call my limo driver, right? Why would I take the
[9619.67s -> 9634.86s]  bus? Who are these people? Wait, did I just get... Did I just get like a luxury Uber? Shared luxury
[9634.86s -> 9651.00s]  Uber or something? Happy birthday. Whose birthday is this? They... They partied themselves out of
[9651.00s -> 9720.62s]  existence. The fuck up. Birthday sucks. All right, I don't... I don't want... I don't want it. I don't
[9720.62s -> 9726.94s]  want it. I don't do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.
[9726.94s -> 9730.22s]  Oh, I forgot. I remember these. Some of these are new. Some of these are new.
[9730.22s -> 9738.47s]  What is this? This is new. This is letters. Some of these are new. Oh, I remember this sand game.
[9738.47s -> 9757.69s]  This sand game is fun. What happened? Oh, you can't touch the middle. You can't touch the middle. I
[9757.69s -> 9766.81s]  remember. This one's fun. I think... I remember I tried to win this, but it's almost impossible to
[9766.81s -> 9783.32s]  win. Did I actually just try to rage quit the game? No. No, no, no. I need 70,000 more tickets.
[9783.32s -> 9799.69s]  This is not... Not efficient. Get out. Dunco? New. Dunco. Wait, have I done this one? Is this one new?
[9800.33s -> 9826.73s]  No, I remember this one. Yeah, I've done this one. Here's some Dunco donuts. Because you're
[9826.73s -> 9840.10s]  a rabbit. I'm sorry. What's the over-under on that? Is that like meme dead at this point,
[9840.10s -> 9851.99s]  and maybe everybody hates it, or people still think it's funny? I'm not sure yet. Oh, they got
[9851.99s -> 9871.21s]  stuck. 1,000 tickets and a free prize? What's the free prize? I don't remember there being a free
[9871.21s -> 9888.60s]  prize. We'll have to check that out. I think it's the cards, right? Bonus. Oh. All right, we've got
[9888.60s -> 9895.13s]  to get these three. We've got to get three tickets. There we go. Bang, bang. What is it? I need all
[9895.13s -> 9900.54s]  the cards. I've got to get them all. What does it say? What do I have? Okay, I need red and blue.
[9901.50s -> 9914.49s]  Red and blue, and then I'm done. Give me a red spawn. You get a Dunco mascot suit?
[9915.21s -> 9922.54s]  No, you get the plush. That's pretty cool. Oh, that's all right. It's going to put these down,
[9922.54s -> 9926.62s]  and I'm going to get the blue card. Give us Dizzy Bird? I'll do Dizzy Bird in a minute.
[9930.17s -> 9934.28s]  Get it for Gary. I will. We're going to do this in another time. We're going to do...
[9935.08s -> 9942.74s]  Okay, good. This should be enough to get the red card as well. I need a black card. Oh,
[9942.74s -> 9950.18s]  shit. I need more than that. Anything but the bird game. But I already beat the bird game,
[9950.18s -> 9964.14s]  so it doesn't matter. Go to the right... I know, I know, I know, I know. I was trying to get the
[9964.14s -> 9993.13s]  blue card. Oh. He knows he can't do it again. Yeah, I know I can't do it again. That's okay.
[9995.96s -> 10002.65s]  It's like what we talked about before. Like Jump King, right? Oh, do the Jump King DLC.
[10002.65s -> 10008.17s]  It's really hard, and it's crazy, and you could like it. No, I know I'm not going to do that
[10008.17s -> 10016.73s]  ever again. I've seen streams and streamers and clips of people on those DLC levels,
[10018.44s -> 10030.76s]  and I know what I'm capable of. It's not that. It's not that. You spoiled it.
[10036.23s -> 10039.27s]  Look at this card. It's right here. How can I not get the one all the way to the left?
[10040.07s -> 10055.06s]  I got the dunko card. It took XQC 60 hours to beat the game. Yeah. Oh, I can feel...
[10056.26s -> 10070.84s]  I can feel that pain. I just can. That's a lot of time. That's a lot. Can I get another push,
[10070.84s -> 10081.99s]  please? All right, we get a black card and we need a red one. Jeremy, can I have some tokens? No.
[10082.87s -> 10097.80s]  Get your run. Just kidding. Here's 50. Go play Dunky, whatever a thing is, as long as you want.
[10099.16s -> 10105.93s]  Okay, we need the red card. Spawn a red card so I can stop playing this, please.
[10106.57s -> 10126.55s]  Spawn a truck? I don't think those are in this game. Give me another card. There's a red card
[10126.55s -> 10140.55s]  over there, but it's not going to count. Oh, I got it. All right, card. That's not bad.
[10141.43s -> 10160.52s]  I don't need a green one. I need a red one. Spawn another one. Let's go. Card. Card. Left machine
[10160.52s -> 10176.63s]  is a red card. Yeah, but it only counts for the machine it's currently on. I need one red. Gotta
[10176.63s -> 10194.90s]  just get this thing to spin. Spin. Bonus. Oh, yeah. Super bonus. Is it seven free spins times two?
[10195.86s -> 10201.06s]  10 free spins times two. We need 20 times three. I'll take that. That's not horrible.
[10202.18s -> 10218.41s]  That's better. That's much better. No. No! This is time. Holy shit, this is times two, guys.
[10219.29s -> 10230.70s]  This shit's times three times three. I imagined that was times three. I want red.
[10232.54s -> 10244.94s]  Jeremy, please. Jeremy, I'll click it in like an hour. Land on bonus again.
[10245.82s -> 10263.18s]  Damn it. Fuck. I need a red card. Oh, my God. I'm seeing Omega Lulz. So let me go ahead and click
[10263.18s -> 10273.72s]  it. Is this the one you wanted me to click on? There's like three links in here. It's all the
[10273.72s -> 10284.55s]  different TV channels. All right, I see it. Okay, cool. You know, when you see Omega Lulz in your
[10284.55s -> 10292.92s]  chat, you have to react. Daily News 10. Find out what wrong with these five foods you eat every day.
[10293.48s -> 10311.06s]  Worms. Elephant roars like a dinosaur. Crisp Pratt accidentally gives away
[10311.62s -> 10339.06s]  travel trivia prize? What are, what is this? That's Crisp. He's trying to react to them.
[10341.14s -> 10351.56s]  I don't know how you guys do this shit so quickly. Yeah, I saw the McChicken one.
[10351.56s -> 10358.79s]  The best fast food sandwich. I don't even know what these images are. There's too many of these.
[10360.22s -> 10365.50s]  Like 20 minutes has gone by and you got this. There's like seven new photoshops in the chat.
[10365.50s -> 10380.26s]  I can't keep up. The Junior Chicken is better. Oh, excuse me. No, it's not.
[10381.06s -> 10398.18s]  The best fast food. I'm trying to move with my mouse. The McChicken from McDonald's. Just plain.
[10398.18s -> 10401.86s]  Just the way it comes. Just McChicken with lettuce, a little bit of mayo.
[10403.18s -> 10407.10s]  It's the best. Just when you're hungry, you can eat like six of them.
[10410.31s -> 10415.99s]  And look, I'm not, this is, I'm not counting like, Oh, what about Chick-fil-A? What about Popeyes?
[10415.99s -> 10425.72s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not having that fight. Everybody knows that Chick-fil-A is better
[10425.72s -> 10430.60s]  than everything. Like I know that. I, I know that. Okay. I already know, but I can't, you don't eat,
[10430.60s -> 10435.64s]  I can't eat, you can't eat Chick-fil-A every day. You can eat McDonald's every day. Why would you
[10435.72s -> 10447.59s]  want to do that? But you, that's like the worst thing I've said. That's a terrible statement.
[10448.71s -> 10453.59s]  You don't want to eat McDonald's every day. You, you technically can. What I mean by that is,
[10453.59s -> 10461.27s]  this is what I mean. Chick-fil-A is sort of, it's a treat in quotes because it's not everywhere.
[10461.27s -> 10468.30s]  There's a McDonald's every one mile. Some places across the country have maybe one Chick-fil-A in
[10468.30s -> 10474.06s]  50 miles. So it's, yes, you, you, what are you going to drive to Chick-fil-A fucking 50 miles
[10474.06s -> 10496.66s]  every day? That's what I meant by that statement. Good thing I have clarified that. Red card. Red
[10496.66s -> 10514.46s]  card please. Just eat McDonald's every day. Chicken's unimpressive. Yeah, but it's, it's easy.
[10527.61s -> 10534.76s]  Go left. No, I need to get to zero. All right. Okay. I gotta, I have to move on. I can't do this
[10534.76s -> 10541.02s]  all day. I have to move on. Where are my tickets? All right. Here we go. Good, good, good, good,
[10541.02s -> 10552.44s]  good, good. Yes. Fuck you. No, don't do five. All right. We're at a good spot.
[10554.02s -> 10583.86s]  Give me a shitload and give me a red card so I can get out of here. Red. It's not red. Yellow.
[10587.08s -> 10604.86s]  Give me a red card. That's a yellow card. How many times am I going to get yellow and blue?
[10607.45s -> 10641.42s]  Red. Oh my God. I just want the red. This is how they keep you here. Bonus. Oh fucking yeah.
[10642.30s -> 10644.86s]  Yes. Yup. All right. 20.
[10651.77s -> 10659.59s]  All right. We got 11. Don't want it. There's no way there's a seven this close. There it is.
[10662.52s -> 10670.84s]  Do I know for a fact that the cards don't carry over? No. I mean, there's three different machines
[10670.84s -> 10674.20s]  here that have three different numbers on them right now. I assume it has to be like that.
[10685.82s -> 10699.54s]  Red, red, red, red, red, red, red. Yeah. Guys, we did it. You and I, we did it.
[10701.96s -> 10715.56s]  And there's two. I can get two ducks. Make it three. Put a third one down here. Too good to be true.
[10715.56s -> 10737.56s]  Too good to be true. Well, let's get it. We get Gary two. That's actually not an untrue statement.
[10739.05s -> 10745.98s]  Bonus. All right. Here comes the first duck. We're going to get two or three ducks.
[10751.35s -> 10755.75s]  All right. Come on. Got it. Thousand tickets and a free prize. Where is it?
[10757.70s -> 10764.71s]  Wait, I already got one? This would be number three.
[10764.71s -> 10784.70s]  Where do I get the free prize from? Is it? What happened to the cards? Oh, they reset. Okay. All
[10784.70s -> 10788.92s]  right. All right. All right. All right. We don't even. Hold on. This is important. Here's how we
[10789.48s -> 10801.32s]  wait one second. Because, uh, red, green, black. Okay. Hold on. Just, I'm just going to see what
[10801.32s -> 10810.95s]  happens. If a yellow card drops, then I'm going to wait. There's yellow and blue over here.
[10811.83s -> 10824.62s]  Well, first, let me go see, make sure I can even get this prize. I'm owed two. I'm technically,
[10824.62s -> 10832.34s]  I'm owed two prizes. Yellow and blue is right there. Let's see if you guys are right. See if
[10832.34s -> 10855.93s]  it carries over. Might be the final push. Let me get my prize. He's a dunko addict, just like grandma.
[10855.93s -> 10862.82s]  Holy shit. That's a lot of tickets. A lot of tickets. A lot of tickets. Let's test it. No,
[10862.82s -> 10921.85s]  they all reset. They reset. Where's my free prizes? Where are they? Oh shit. All right. I've got,
[10921.85s -> 10934.76s]  how many tickets do I got now? 37,000. Almost there. We're at 37%. All right. I'm going to do
[10934.76s -> 10939.00s]  this one. I'm going to try this one again. I like this one. This one's fun. As long as you pay
[10939.00s -> 10963.82s]  attention. All right. I'm trying to go too quick. Slow it down. The trick to this game is you let
[10963.82s -> 10969.14s]  it bounce once and then you do it on the second return. If you wait longer than that, you're not
[10969.14s -> 10973.48s]  going to get it because your brain can't keep up with it. You can only keep up with one turn.
[10974.12s -> 11013.53s]  It speeds up at that last two. Is this a rerun? No, it's not a rerun. I just wanted to come back
[11013.53s -> 11022.06s]  here. I have to, I'm just trying to get some, ah, it's not a rerun. There's a new arcade that
[11022.06s -> 11025.34s]  we went to. 15 new games. I'm just checking out some of the old ones, some of the new stuff that
[11025.34s -> 11030.30s]  they put in. They put some new stuff in. I'm just checking it out. If there's some stuff in here
[11030.30s -> 11036.89s]  that's new, there's, I'm just checking it out. And you play some old stuff to just when you're
[11036.89s -> 11082.58s]  checking something out, he's re, I'm re-recording. Why did I think that was going to be too,
[11083.22s -> 11113.80s]  what the fuck am I doing? This is what, that nerd neck. How do I get out of this? Oh, it's C.
[11118.15s -> 11163.93s]  Hold on. What? Oh, I remember this one. This one's fun. Here we go. Ready? You are slow. I got it.
[11167.88s -> 11186.84s]  Oh, oh, oh, what's happening? My graphics card's dying. My graphics card's dying. This, this dream
[11186.84s -> 11197.02s]  might turn off. Are you guys seeing that? Are you guys seeing that? Green artifacts are all over
[11197.02s -> 11218.23s]  my screen. No, you guys, it's not pulling it. Uh-oh. Oh shit. It's only this game that's doing it.
[11220.18s -> 11244.28s]  Fuck, yeah. Dead. It's like, the graphics card's fucking with me. Is it actually? Oh, it is my,
[11244.28s -> 11297.06s]  okay. Uh, he's in the matrix. I know what it is. I fix it. I fix it. I fix it. Quick, eat the red
[11297.06s -> 11311.80s]  pill. No, but the blue one's probably blueberry. Hold on. I actually have to, my monitor just turned
[11311.80s -> 11320.65s]  off. Oh, my cord was loose. It's okay. I fixed it. We're good to go. My monitor's just fucking
[11320.65s -> 11326.89s]  turned off. Come on. What are you doing? Stop. Why is my monitor doing this? Does my cable suck?
[11329.59s -> 11340.92s]  I'll do it. Oh, stop it. Ha ha. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. What are you talking about?
[11345.54s -> 11376.28s]  I gotta pee. I'm gonna take this again. Where are the balls going, Jerma? Where are the balls going?
[11376.28s -> 11382.89s]  I don't know. What's more efficient, this or the spinny jackpot thing? What do you think?
[11383.99s -> 11411.96s]  I gotta pee. Go to the bathroom now. No. All right, let's go. Streamer shits himself on stream.
[11411.96s -> 11417.03s]  I don't have to shit. I'm not gonna, I don't, I'm not gonna disappear for like 30 minutes.
[11432.42s -> 11446.62s]  Who shits for 30 minutes? I don't even start with this nonsense. It really depends.
[11447.26s -> 11466.39s]  How much time do I have? Yeah, it depends on how much time I have. Do I have,
[11467.45s -> 11487.66s]  how many, how many hours do I have before I have to do something? It's in. I wish I could just put
[11487.66s -> 11499.10s]  in like 10 credits worth. You know, this one's not even winnable unless the person who,
[11500.30s -> 11503.26s]  you know, these machines have to take in $1,000 sometimes before they do anything.
[11512.52s -> 11518.44s]  There'll be a PlayStation 4 up there or a Nintendo DS. How much is a Nintendo DS?
[11520.18s -> 11527.61s]  Like what? 200? How much is 3DS? Like 150? 200 bucks? All right, so let's say it's $200.
[11528.57s -> 11535.90s]  For the Nintendo DS to be able to be won, like it depends on who owns the machine,
[11535.90s -> 11541.10s]  but for the most part it's usually at least two or three times the amount of money has to come in.
[11542.04s -> 11547.00s]  So these prizes on the top row that's a Nintendo DS, wow, it's $2 a dollar to play this.
[11548.28s -> 11556.70s]  600 bucks has to come in sometimes for this to happen and you also have to win. You also have
[11556.78s -> 11566.97s]  to win the actual game of skill once they allow you to be able to win. It's not RNG. No,
[11567.61s -> 11575.26s]  play my favorite game here. Inside of Secrets. That's illegal. You know what's funny? Why is
[11575.26s -> 11585.37s]  that legal? It's not actually a game of skill if you put, is that supposed to be legal? Why is
[11585.37s -> 11603.88s]  that legal? It's not technically gambling. Not even close, not even close, not even close.
[11615.26s -> 11622.92s]  I love this game. Hey, it's my first stream here. You're top 10 underrated streamers. Oh, cool.
[11622.92s -> 11648.81s]  Welcome. You missed some of that. What? Too much. Oh, I have to get green once. I love green.
[11649.45s -> 11665.53s]  Did I get green? I got, how did I get green? What? I wasn't even looking. Why would it give
[11665.53s -> 11671.03s]  me a bonus? Jeremy, you've been playing the chicken game since July. Please stop.
[11676.38s -> 11708.44s]  I did it. Yeah, he said it. I've seen the video. You know how hard it is to avoid some of these
[11708.44s -> 11715.61s]  videos? Hey, click this link. What is this? It's called, okay, cool. I don't want to watch this
[11715.61s -> 11727.13s]  right now. I'm busy. Imagine getting that message for six straight years. You have to apologize for
[11727.13s -> 11740.14s]  that. Wait, what? Wait, why? Why? I have to apologize? I have to apologize.
[11750.09s -> 11757.13s]  We need a public apology. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What do you want from me?
[11758.01s -> 11765.50s]  Well, I can do an impression. I can do a shitty impression of Larry David, but I can't do like,
[11766.06s -> 11785.02s]  oh yeah. I can't say that. I'm like, apologize again. I'm not even, I don't even understand.
[11787.03s -> 11793.67s]  I was, I was like mocking the meme and now I have to apologize for mocking the meme.
[11794.63s -> 11805.85s]  No, no, no apology. Nope. Not gonna happen. No, I'm going, I'm buried. I'm getting buried with this
[11805.85s -> 11816.30s]  one. I'm getting buried. They're going to be burying me in like another 75 years. And the
[11816.30s -> 11821.50s]  elves impersonator that I've hired to do the talk at the end of your life thing, you're going to be
[11821.50s -> 11881.58s]  like, oh well it seems that this boy, I'm not apologizing for it. I'm not apologizing for
[11881.58s -> 11890.28s]  saying it. I'm not apologizing. I'm not apologizing for saying I, oh, you said the meme thing. No,
[11890.28s -> 11898.94s]  no apologies from here. I'm going to sleep with it. Apologize for what? I, if you weren't,
[11898.94s -> 11905.74s]  if you weren't here like two minutes ago, somebody said ayaya in the chat and I did like a,
[11905.74s -> 11910.86s]  like a look, it's the, it's the thing, it's the video and people freaked out and now they demanded
[11910.86s -> 11942.73s]  apology. Apologize. I actually uploaded a video to my main channel and it opens up with me with like
[11942.73s -> 11947.61s]  music playing like guys. I just want to say a couple things. I'm, first of all, it's a hard
[11947.61s -> 11958.68s]  video to make. I'm really sorry. I said ayaya. I did like a thing where I pretended to be the
[11958.68s -> 11974.62s]  video for like, like at most six seconds and everybody tried to burn my house down and they
[11974.62s -> 11979.18s]  screamed at me and they called me a bunch of fucking names and idiot and stupid and they,
[11979.18s -> 11982.54s]  and they, they, they're screaming at me, but I'm the one that has to apologize now.
[11982.54s -> 11988.14s]  So, uh, here you go. Uh, I guess I'm, I guess if you're bad, if you're mad about that, then
[11988.14s -> 12003.46s]  sorry to hear that. It's an emoticon. The passive aggressive apology, the passive aggressive
[12003.46s -> 12019.78s]  non-apology. Apologize now. Apologize. All right. I have to get the fuck out of this
[12020.66s -> 12025.22s]  before I put on the video and sing to it at the same time, just to punish you.
[12026.02s -> 12041.51s]  Oh, now everybody wants me to do that. I'll do it. Do it. Do it. Oh, I'll do that. Do it. No,
[12041.51s -> 12046.86s]  do that. Do that. Do it. Do it. These are the people that just demanded an apology because
[12046.86s -> 12059.78s]  I said the word out loud. Unbelievable. Pick a side guys. It was an empty threat. I'm doing
[12059.78s -> 12083.83s]  this one more time and I'm moving on. Oh, it's glitched up there. All right. Goodbye. Please
[12083.83s -> 12092.15s]  tickets. Do it or you're not going to get any gifted subs ever again. Enable the, I enable
[12092.15s -> 12098.62s]  that emote for punishment. No, no, I'm not going to enable an emote. What was I thinking saying
[12098.62s -> 12111.08s]  that out loud? I of course saying the word, saying the A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A out loud to a large
[12111.08s -> 12117.48s]  amount of people in this chat apparently is as if I turned on the webcam and was just naked
[12120.31s -> 12138.44s]  going like, yeah, look at this. Wait, look at me. What? Compact empty threats. I got it.
[12144.26s -> 12150.15s]  It's worse than that. It's not. All right. That's it. That's it. I can't, I've already beaten this
[12150.15s -> 12153.59s]  once. I don't have to beat it again. This actually is a rerun stream. If I stay here,
[12154.23s -> 12158.71s]  play the video. I'm not playing the video. No, no. Okay. Just delete the last five minutes.
[12159.59s -> 12169.29s]  Just pretend the last five minutes on stream didn't happen. You know what I mean? Like we can
[12169.29s -> 12183.14s]  just get over that. That the last five, the last five minutes did not happen. You know what I'm
[12183.14s -> 12206.01s]  saying? The last five minutes didn't happen. The most polarizing moment. All right. 40,000 tickets.
[12206.01s -> 12214.87s]  I almost just did it. I almost just went, I almost just went, I almost did it again.
[12225.05s -> 12243.19s]  Oh my God. Can you believe that Trevor lied about what? Give me those headphones. Give me
[12243.99s -> 12256.46s]  those headphones. All right. I'm good. I did it. Out, out, out. It was fucking easy. All right.
[12256.46s -> 12262.86s]  Let's go to Bass. Pull it. And we're going back to the other casino.
[12268.87s -> 12281.85s]  Do it. Oh, you got yourself 10 tickets. What is cuckoo clock? I've never seen cuckoo clock.
[12281.85s -> 12295.19s]  Let's do cuckoo clock. This shit is impossible. I don't know why people even play this.
[12298.81s -> 12310.82s]  There's no reason to play this. Yeah, I said this last time. Get me out of this. What a dumb game.
[12312.04s -> 12319.38s]  And for some reason, also, every arcade now, there's got to be some weird deal with this company.
[12319.94s -> 12325.86s]  Whoever manufactures this shit, because it's one of the only games at most arcades with this
[12325.86s -> 12333.67s]  10 of them in a row. 10 of them. And there's always people playing them. Every machine is
[12333.67s -> 12349.48s]  loaded with people waiting in line. Are they paid actors? And they're like, it's like six bucks to
[12349.48s -> 12357.02s]  play this. So they're just playing for free. And then you go, oh, I think I want to do that. And
[12357.02s -> 12360.78s]  they go, oh, I guess you're gonna have a turn. I almost won a thousand. And you spend 30 bucks
[12360.78s -> 12416.41s]  here and then you leave and they made 30 dollars. All right, let's go. Cash out. 40,234 tickets.
[12416.41s -> 12420.41s]  Let's go back to the other arcade and have some fun. But first, let's listen to the fun song.
[12420.41s -> 12430.60s]  Remember the funny song? Here we go. It's time for the funny song. Where's the funny song?
[12436.55s -> 12445.96s]  Never mind. I can't. No. All right, let's go. Limo driver, please take me to the other
[12446.68s -> 12468.39s]  casino, please. Uh huh. Let's go to the UFO. Just scream at us already. Jesus, I've been waiting
[12468.39s -> 12477.26s]  for hours. What? Scream at us? Why am I screaming at you? I didn't even play this one. Are you
[12477.26s -> 12490.01s]  serious? I didn't play the clock tower. What does this one do? Ball drops. Oh, it's this thing. You
[12490.01s -> 12511.77s]  have to. Damn it. All right. 500. I hate this thing too. Why is it always the worst ones that
[12511.77s -> 12518.31s]  take up the most amount of space? This is a small apartment. You could live in the spot that this
[12518.31s -> 12524.62s]  thing takes up in the casino, in the arcade. Why does it have to take this much time? I mean,
[12524.62s -> 12539.77s]  this much space. I got to at least win the 500. I wasn't even ready. That's not fair.
[12540.65s -> 12589.06s]  That's unfair. Why is everybody doing question marks? What? You could have had 500. I mean,
[12589.06s -> 12594.73s]  it's hard to control. This one's this one. This one's a waste. I could get so much more tickets
[12594.73s -> 12608.26s]  playing the spaceship or anything. All right. Hold on. Two balls. There we go. I have infinite
[12608.26s -> 12632.98s]  money though. No, I don't. I'm empty. That should be a thousand. Oh, why? I need money.
[12633.85s -> 12846.84s]  All right. I gotta pee. I forgot to pee. Let's pee first. I'll be right back. One of these days
[12846.84s -> 12851.74s]  might be funny if I'm like, oh, I'm going to go take a break. And it's been like three,
[12851.74s -> 12858.17s]  four hours on stream. I go take a break. I'm just going to go pee. And then I come back
[12858.17s -> 12862.33s]  and it's a new video feed. And it's just me IRL like going through the McDonald's drive-through.
[12863.29s -> 12878.57s]  And I come back and we just go back to what we were doing. Maybe you'll see that someday.
[12878.57s -> 12890.33s]  All right. Back to it. 40,000 tickets. I need a hundred. We know how to get that. We know how
[12890.33s -> 12904.18s]  to get that. Oh, no money. Solve that real quick. No, wait. That's not money. That's tickets. Where's
[12904.18s -> 12916.42s]  the it's where is it? Take over here. Don't even eat the food. Why would I not eat the food?
[12917.30s -> 12935.30s]  He's becoming delirious. Now check this out. We're going to get the other 60,000 tickets real soon.
[12936.34s -> 12954.92s]  Friendship ended with German. Now Drew Crew is my best friend. I'm part of that crew. Yes,
[12954.92s -> 12960.52s]  this is just a money printing machine. From what I understand, when this game actually releases,
[12961.24s -> 12966.44s]  when it truly launches and it's actually in 1.0, there's going to be another game mode called
[12966.44s -> 12972.78s]  survival where you cannot just print money. You need to do jobs and stuff. I think they really
[12972.78s -> 12980.89s]  want it to be an interesting, weird survival game from what I understand. All right, let's do it.
[12984.17s -> 12997.14s]  Here we go. Kids gambling survival. Hey, well, you gotta hand it to them. No one's ever done that
[12997.14s -> 13006.07s]  before. No one's ever made a kids gambling game. Actually, I have. Oh yes, they have like every
[13006.07s -> 13010.39s]  game that's come out. It's been like in the last five years. It's been like a gambling game
[13010.39s -> 13029.06s]  just specifically to make kids gamble. What am I talking about? It's all of them like you.
[13031.08s -> 13042.14s]  But they're not survival gambling games. Oh, you're right. This one is how you get the tickets.
[13043.46s -> 13048.34s]  I'll be there in less than 20 minutes. All right, start counting now. I know people are going to be
[13048.34s -> 13053.22s]  like, dude, you're going to be here for 10 straight minutes. Yes, at least. Let me see. Three hours and
[13053.22s -> 13080.17s]  37 minutes at three hours and 47 minutes. We'll see where we are. This machine is going to get
[13080.17s -> 13091.93s]  nerfed. It probably is. It probably is. This is how you can get tickets quick here. It's 500 every
[13091.93s -> 13096.81s]  potentially if you can really time this correctly, 500 tickets every three seconds.
[13106.38s -> 13114.39s]  These machines are easy in real life. These machines are rigged in real life.
[13115.19s -> 13130.02s]  Evacuate the building. Evacuate. Evacuate this one too many times. This machine is smoking and
[13130.02s -> 13154.74s]  setting off the fire alarm. Sparkle Kid? I love Sparkle Kid. Sparkle Kid's awesome.
[13155.70s -> 13163.54s]  Yeah, even a robot can't win these. Yeah, because it'll make it move one light forward or one light
[13163.54s -> 13167.62s]  backward regardless if you hit it or not. They've tested this with programs.
[13171.70s -> 13175.94s]  No, this is not balanced. I spent three hours grinding Dizzy Bird for payout. That wasn't half
[13175.94s -> 13203.67s]  of this. Sorry, you gotta get with the meta. At what point do you think somebody that worked
[13204.31s -> 13209.27s]  at this arcade would come over here and be like, what's going on over there? What do you think?
[13209.27s -> 13212.23s]  They would just not even give a shit. Who cares? And just like go back to what they were doing.
[13213.19s -> 13237.46s]  Oh no, I'm becoming more ticket than man. Are you getting paid to stop them? Are you getting
[13237.46s -> 13265.85s]  paid to work here? I'm out of money. Holy shit. All right, this is a lot. Let's see.
[13266.89s -> 13277.66s]  That wasn't even 10 minutes. That was what? Four minutes? That's 8,000 tickets in four minutes.
[13279.77s -> 13298.71s]  Yep, I'm gonna do the money machine like five times in a row. Move on from this lame ass place.
[13298.71s -> 13319.05s]  It's time for the Drew to solve the case. I appreciate the effort on that. Go-karts or
[13319.05s -> 13326.01s]  Riot? I will. I'm gonna bring my hoverboard onto the go-kart track. They won't be able to catch me.
[13326.81s -> 13353.75s]  They'll try. Let's do it. If you hold down a while while playing it, it'll automatically
[13353.75s -> 13366.87s]  start another one so you can get them faster. If you hold down? What? Hold down A.
[13366.87s -> 13408.76s]  Oh my god. Oh, oh, the cops are outside. Oh my Jesus. This game is a disgrace.
[13410.60s -> 13429.61s]  Drew with your face. What? I didn't read that right. I haven't gotten it in like five seconds.
[13430.33s -> 13439.05s]  Oh, that was lame. Stay at this cool arcade. Buy a hoverboard after you are paid.
[13439.93s -> 13447.14s]  That was... Come on. I haven't got one in like five. Come on. It's washed up. No, I'm not. No,
[13447.14s -> 13494.55s]  I'm not. Don't say that. Two, three, four. Out of money. I want to do this in real life.
[13495.43s -> 13512.57s]  Am I allowed to stream in an arcade? Probably not unless I get permission.
[13513.21s -> 13525.40s]  How many was that? And we're not even at 10 minutes. What'd I tell you? What was that?
[13525.40s -> 13535.14s]  8,000 first one. 6,500 for the next one. That's 14. Almost 15,000 tickets in 10 minutes.
[13535.14s -> 13538.42s]  Easy. I'm gonna do this twice in a row so I don't have to leave the machine.
[13544.92s -> 13569.50s]  Yes, you can. Oh, that's cool. All right. Can you actually do that? What's Icelandic for
[13569.50s -> 13586.14s]  degenerate gambler? I don't know. I don't know what it is. What is it? Get back in there.
[13586.70s -> 13598.15s]  This game doesn't take our fancy. It's time to party with Nancy. Play it three more times.
[13599.29s -> 13608.90s]  I'll stop at 200 bucks. Guys, I got like 10 years of streaming to play Nancy Drew.
[13608.90s -> 13629.78s]  And that's how long it's gonna take. He thinks he has 10 years. I got plenty of time. All right,
[13629.78s -> 13636.02s]  one more time and then I'm gonna sit there for like at least 10 to 15 straight minutes. He's
[13636.02s -> 13653.37s]  addicted. Yeah, I'm addicted to getting cool shit. I want to get the hoverboard. Once I get the
[13653.37s -> 13666.98s]  hoverboard then everything's fine. A raid just came in. A huge raid from Boxbox. Boxbox. Hello
[13666.98s -> 13678.12s]  again. Welcome, everybody. Thanks a lot, Boxbox. I'm playing arcade games right now. Boxbox,
[13678.12s -> 13695.00s]  I gotta raid you. When do you stream? Every day? Right now? Well, you can't be streaming
[13695.00s -> 13703.77s]  right now. But hey, welcome, everybody. Thanks a lot, Boxbox. Seriously, that's a lot of people.
[13705.43s -> 13709.03s]  Unfortunately, you came to a stream where the person is just doing this.
[13711.51s -> 13715.03s]  I'm addicted. I'm already addicted. So there's not, I can't say much besides this.
[13719.37s -> 13727.83s]  There it is. That's for Boxbox and his raid. What's that? You want two jackpots?
[13728.63s -> 13734.39s]  You want two jackpots? Oh yeah, you'll take two jackpots. Sure thing. How about three jackpots?
[13735.51s -> 13744.66s]  You want three? I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. You're in follower only mode. Oh
[13744.66s -> 13752.46s]  shit, turn it off. Turn off follower only for like 10 minutes. That's two jackpots in a row.
[13753.74s -> 13765.06s]  Here comes three in a row for you guys. There it is. All right, holding it down is like,
[13765.06s -> 13772.41s]  it's crashing the game. It's too late. Just turn off, you can turn it off. Turn off follower only
[13772.41s -> 13782.46s]  for like 30 minutes. That's too long. I got it all. He's playing elf bowling later. Stick around,
[13782.46s -> 13799.35s]  raiders. Imagine falling asleep. What? They left for another Drew Crews streamer.
[13801.94s -> 13810.57s]  Is my money going up? How do I have? Come on, I'm washed up. I've got to, I can't just suck like
[13810.57s -> 13823.42s]  this. I have to do, we just had a huge raid coming. Come on. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. This is not good.
[13837.56s -> 13845.70s]  I actually did lose it. No, I'm washed up. Oh, I'm really washed up. I might as well quit.
[13845.70s -> 13866.65s]  Never quit. Don't ever quit. Ski ball, ski ball, ski ball. I'll do some ski ball after I spend
[13866.65s -> 13896.98s]  200 on this. That's three in a row. Yeah, what's the most I've ever had? Five in a row. Wish me
[13896.98s -> 13902.94s]  a Merry Christmas. Hey, have a Merry Christmas. Hope you have a good one. Hope you get everything
[13902.94s -> 13909.42s]  you want. Hope Santa doesn't get stuck in your chimney and suffocate because he can't get out
[13909.42s -> 13912.94s]  and he can't reach his cell phone. Because how would you be able to reach your cell phone if
[13912.94s -> 13915.82s]  you got stuck in a chimney? You can't reach down in your pockets. You would just suffocate in the
[13915.82s -> 13923.37s]  chimney. I really hope that doesn't happen to Santa at your house. Because then Santa's lawyers
[13923.37s -> 13927.85s]  might come and find you and they might be like, well, your chimney was not at regulation. Chimney
[13927.85s -> 13932.41s]  is about 15% too small. And you'd be like, I don't know. I mean, you'd lose everything.
[13932.41s -> 13955.86s]  I'm speaking of suffocating.
[13961.85s -> 13967.77s]  Again. Help me. I can't reach my cell phone. I can't reach my cell phone.
[13969.78s -> 13986.62s]  No, no. Yeah.
[13998.76s -> 14013.72s]  I can just do it by feeling. I can close my eyes and do it. Use the force.
[14023.54s -> 14067.29s]  Don't make me put it on and get sued. I'm putting it on. Who cares? Come on. I can do it.
[14076.31s -> 14105.82s]  I can't do it. Come on. Come on. Just think of, just think of Uncle Ben. Wait, that's Spider-Man.
[14119.02s -> 14153.26s]  Yes. German confirmed force sensitive. You think so? Really? I think I am. Let me try. Let's see.
[14154.54s -> 14194.55s]  What the fuck, dude? What the fuck is going on? I think I should go to the academy.
[14195.51s -> 14212.50s]  First joke. Everybody hated that. Why? Why? What? Spoilers, but you can have force powers.
[14215.26s -> 14231.69s]  Oh, the game crashed. Why? Why was that the worst joke ever? Was it?
[14234.46s -> 14241.35s]  To apologize. Sorry again, guys, for a force. The Star Wars bed.
[14250.30s -> 14282.89s]  I actually can't see. I can play. Why can I play like this? What? I turned into a caterpillar.
[14290.74s -> 14323.72s]  Oh my God. My chest hurts. I have to win one. Oh, it fell off. Okay. Do I have no money?
[14327.85s -> 14357.82s]  Oh, it actually moved me. Hey ACDC Freak, thanks for the 5 community subs. Hold F.
[14358.78s -> 14392.62s]  Oh no, those are out of reach. Every last drop. He's going to force, he's force grabbing them.
[14402.63s -> 14417.40s]  14,000 tickets. Holy shit. 70% of the way there, boys and girls. All right, now I'll ride the
[14417.40s -> 14427.98s]  go-karts. No, no, no, no. The box box wanted me to do skee-ball. I'll do that. It's been like,
[14427.98s -> 14434.14s]  it's been like, it's been like 30 minutes. Box box, are you still here? This one's for you.
[14434.86s -> 14467.54s]  Right in the 100. Come on. Box box left an hour ago. Whoa, what was that? Why does that sound like
[14467.54s -> 14484.95s]  I smashed a window? Riven players don't deserve. What? I don't know what that is. What's a Riven
[14484.95s -> 14520.12s]  player? Mist Riven is a good game. Oh, quick play sorting algorithms. Oh, hey, by the way,
[14520.12s -> 14524.76s]  okay. Box box viewers, those of you that are still here, I want to ask a question because my viewers,
[14525.48s -> 14529.56s]  whoa, they fucking yelled at me and called me an asshole and an idiot for this. Listen to me.
[14530.50s -> 14535.62s]  How many times have you, as a box box viewer, right? As somebody that's maybe not,
[14535.62s -> 14541.48s]  never been here before, how many of you have accidentally in skee-ball or in throw the ball
[14541.48s -> 14544.92s]  that the thing knocked his head down? How many times have you thrown a little too hard and it's
[14544.92s -> 14555.94s]  come all the way back and hit you in the chest or something? Apparently, I'm a psycho. How many
[14555.94s -> 14559.80s]  times have you ever done something like this? Like ready? Like, oh shit, I fucked it up and
[14559.80s -> 14576.39s]  it's coming back. That happening to me makes me apparently a serial killer. You killed God yesterday.
[14577.61s -> 14589.88s]  Oh, sorting algorithms. All right, get me out of here, get me out, get me out. Let's go back to my,
[14589.88s -> 14600.44s]  let's go back to my, no, go-karts, go-karts. I'm gonna try to win go-karts. That's normal to be a,
[14600.44s -> 14610.15s]  yeah, I know, that's what I'm saying. All right, what do we got? Session one, 221, gonna be 221.
[14619.27s -> 14633.86s]  All right, let's go. Ready? See if I can beat 221. Do I have to pay for this? No, I do. Let's make it
[14633.86s -> 14655.56s]  clean. I have to get in first place. Were these people on the track before I got here though?
[14655.56s -> 14695.43s]  That's not fair. They had a head start. Session six. Get out of the way. Who threw this can over here?
[14696.31s -> 14722.09s]  Oh, yeah, I did. I don't think you can even get in first place. I don't understand this.
[14726.15s -> 14732.52s]  You know what I'm saying? There's no drivers to be in a position above me.
[14733.32s -> 14751.80s]  This is pretty good. It's a pretty good time. No major screw-ups. Whoa, wait, how did I get
[14751.80s -> 14788.62s]  positioned? Oh shit, I'm in fourth place. Third place, let's go. Out of my way. I'm a 34-year-old
[14788.62s -> 14810.28s]  man. I need to break an 11-year-old's go-kart record. Out of my way. I don't know how you
[14810.28s -> 14843.42s]  do it much better than this. Third place, how? I can still get third place. Experiences.
[14845.10s -> 14878.25s]  What about my experience? Go free camp. I have to hit W, A, S, and D.
[14879.53s -> 14893.05s]  I don't understand. Why are there so many green bean characters? I don't get it.
[14893.05s -> 14937.96s]  Why am I the only human? I can't turn the mouse. He's using his feet to drive.
[14938.92s -> 14951.03s]  He's actually using feet to drive. Why can I not move my...
[15001.11s -> 15015.82s]  I was in position number four. Wait a minute, that's a cheat. Can I... Wait a minute. Hold on,
[15015.82s -> 15024.07s]  preset the whole thing. I can cheat. If I go that way and then come... I can drive over this and
[15024.07s -> 15036.41s]  just... Okay, let's try it. It's not positioning, it's just lap time. Yeah, so who cares? Let's go.
[15037.37s -> 15063.51s]  What if I... Wait, hold on. What if I do this? How smart is the game? Smart. Can't tech that one.
[15068.01s -> 15078.81s]  Yeah, I'm stuck. All right, I'm not... I'm not gonna win that one. Who cares?
[15109.21s -> 15113.46s]  Sorting algorithm. Here it comes.
[15113.46s -> 15124.20s]  Um, how many club remixes of that song do you think exist?
[15138.47s -> 15143.74s]  Too many. I would... I would agree with you. Oh, shit, here we go again.
[15149.74s -> 15156.30s]  Don't worry, I'll get him back. Watch. No, don't come back, because they're on the way out there
[15156.30s -> 15160.38s]  like I'm thinking about clicking the X and then this guy just did fucking three jackpots.
[15160.70s -> 15171.80s]  I didn't do three. Jeremy, you dropped 3,000 subs.
[15176.28s -> 15197.42s]  Whoops. You lost three. Well, I... I gained like 30,000 subs today, right?
[15198.62s -> 15211.50s]  That's... Okay, that's fine. All right, 73,000. 73%. All right, what can I play that won't...
[15212.30s -> 15215.50s]  What if I turn the volume down and we just... And I do that and just win?
[15216.14s -> 15244.31s]  What do you think? Dipman just gave 5,000 bits. Thank you, Dipman. 50 bucks right now. Bang.
[15244.87s -> 15253.08s]  Coming in hot. And Dipman says, I got pulled over for speeding today and the officer let me off
[15253.08s -> 15256.92s]  with a warning because he was in the Christmas spirit. Thought I'd pay it forward. Merry Christmas
[15256.92s -> 15264.74s]  and thanks for five years of laughs. Slow down. First of all, slow down. You're not gonna go that
[15264.74s -> 15271.94s]  fast. Second of all, thanks for the 5,000 bits, the $50. Yeah, it's the spirit of feeling good,
[15271.94s -> 15283.96s]  spirit of giving. You know what I mean? Spirit of giving and receiving because I really hope that
[15283.96s -> 15293.98s]  under the tree come the 25th that I get another couple of mugs for my heated mug set. Just
[15294.86s -> 15305.00s]  throwing it out there for if anybody that might be listening. A duck. I would actually love a duck
[15305.00s -> 15308.68s]  pet. No, but seriously though, Dipman, that's a lot of money. Thank you. That's a huge amount of
[15308.68s -> 15321.72s]  money and just slow down. You're not gonna go that fast. Why do I have all this gas? Why do I have
[15321.72s -> 15341.37s]  10 gas? Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go in the money machine twice and I'm gonna get 25,000
[15341.37s -> 15348.50s]  tickets and then I'm... Look, we'll put on like Yoshi's Story OST or something. Just hang out.
[15349.30s -> 15369.16s]  Go home and bring Harry. You could go for a DeVito Dew right now. I'll get one.
[15372.98s -> 15380.47s]  I'll do the coin pusher game again. I will. I will get my last 500 tickets from the coin pusher.
[15381.35s -> 15391.24s]  Bye, Jerma. I'm gonna go watch Star Wars. Well, as somebody that's force sensitive,
[15391.88s -> 15426.28s]  then I suggest that's cool, you know? What is worst Jedi ever? Let me see. What the
[15426.28s -> 15443.64s]  fuck is going on? I think I should go to the academy.
[15453.05s -> 15482.87s]  This just popped up on my monitor because I closed the tab. Here. Oh, oh, okay. I turn this off.
[15482.87s -> 15486.47s]  Turn this off. I don't want to listen to that anymore. I don't know. Put on fucking Chrono
[15486.47s -> 15506.15s]  Trigger. Put on Trigger OST and just play it. Okay, sounds good. All right, turn this off.
[15516.58s -> 15522.55s]  What? Why is it still going? Why is it doing this?
[15544.89s -> 15568.22s]  Mute. There we go. Now I can't do it without the siren. I can't do it without the siren.
[15569.02s -> 15596.57s]  There's no sense of urgency. 73,000? What do I need? A lot more. Are you doing it with the song?
[15597.29s -> 15620.47s]  Am I? I don't mean to be doing that. Do a text to speech. No, I'm not doing text to speech. What
[15620.47s -> 15635.58s]  am I trying to get with the tickets? I'm trying to get a hoverboard. Damn it. Can you tell me a
[15635.58s -> 15648.95s]  joke? If you do more channel points, maybe you can. Let's see if you guys can figure out my
[15648.95s -> 15654.15s]  favorite song is. What's my favorite song on the entire Chrono Trigger OST? What is it? Anybody
[15654.15s -> 15676.54s]  know? Frog is all right. Frog is okay. It's not Frog. Joke or riot? No, they were going to say
[15676.54s -> 15686.74s]  a joke. They were going to tell a joke. Not me. We're waiting for them to tell the joke. They said,
[15686.74s -> 15696.60s]  do you want to hear a joke? It was in channel points. Please play Chrono Trigger. It's one of
[15696.60s -> 15706.94s]  the best games ever made, so I wouldn't know. It's the epoch theme. Epoch. Epoch. Whatever it is.
[15708.36s -> 15722.82s]  Don't crash. That's the best one. Nah, I picked these up. It's gonna crash. When are you gonna
[15722.82s -> 15728.78s]  do a Chrono Trigger stream? I'd probably treat that the same way I did Mario RPG, which is
[15729.82s -> 15736.15s]  a day that I feel like being nostalgia. I'll beat it. It's another game that I've probably beaten
[15736.79s -> 15749.82s]  at least five to ten times at least. Oh, it's starting to really hang.
[15750.86s -> 15761.27s]  Any good RPG recommendations, chat? I just beat Divinity 2. Chrono Trigger. Yeah, I haven't saved
[15761.27s -> 15772.71s]  the game once all night. Holy shit, this is bad. Excuse me. Knock, knock. Who's there? Who, who,
[15772.71s -> 15791.50s]  who? Who let the owl in? That was pretty good. 83,000. I gotta save the game. Acknowledge me,
[15791.50s -> 15804.55s]  I grinded for these points. Hey, what's up? All right, everyone can breathe.
[15815.67s -> 15836.71s]  Play the epoch theme. It'll show up. You are manually breathing now. That doesn't work,
[15836.71s -> 15841.22s]  it only works in Jump King when I'm aware of every single thing I'm doing.
[15845.91s -> 15850.39s]  Did they add new things to the game? Yes, this area that I'm in right now is a brand new area
[15851.19s -> 15858.15s]  as of a week or two ago. 15 new games, 100,000 tickets for a hoverboard, and you get a house now
[15858.15s -> 15875.11s]  and a duck. Be cool. I don't like this one. This one's sad. Where is it? Where's the epoch? Battle
[15875.11s -> 15893.32s]  theme? Pretty good. Where's the epoch? Come on, where's the epoch? The epoch's the best. Oh,
[15893.32s -> 15908.52s]  that one's good too. What the hell is it? It's got, it's called like the wings of time or something,
[15908.52s -> 15953.83s]  right? Wings across time. There it is. Let's go. This is the best song. This is like Actraiser,
[15953.83s -> 15986.58s]  is it? Dev in chat? Really? No, why do I believe that? Dev ain't here. Hey, it's me. The thing is
[15986.58s -> 15990.66s]  that's like the boy who cried wolf because remember when I played Dusk and everyone was like,
[15990.66s -> 16000.14s]  dude, Dev, Dev in chat. And I'm like, okay. Yeah, whatever. That was real. And then started tweeting.
[16000.14s -> 16002.46s]  Remember like they started tweeting that I was bad at the game and stuff.
[16013.61s -> 16023.10s]  You are bad at the game. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to defend myself here.
[16023.10s -> 16029.58s]  If you play a game like Dusk on these, on the, they arguably the actual hardest difficulty in
[16029.58s -> 16036.39s]  the game and you beat it, what do you want me to do? Close my eyes and do it? Back to the music.
[16037.11s -> 16069.38s]  We're close. Just throwing chairs at us. Eat a ghost pepper. Oh, by the way, I also figured out
[16070.26s -> 16074.74s]  after the fact that the boots was just a joke. You guys, they don't do anything. So yeah,
[16075.78s -> 16078.49s]  I'm glad we had a fight over that for like an hour and a half straight.
[16079.45s -> 16093.78s]  Shit. Okay. Come on. I have to, this has got to be the one. All right. I promise. I won't play
[16093.78s -> 16098.10s]  this one again. I promise. I promise. I won't play this one again. I promise.
[16098.98s -> 16117.21s]  We will finish the rest with games that you guys want me to play. Oh, it's starting to take over.
[16118.33s -> 16128.30s]  Promise me you'll get the boots. Maybe another playthrough years from now. That's three in a
[16128.30s -> 16146.52s]  row. All right. I'm going to, I'm definitely close. I gotta go. I have two more chances.
[16147.48s -> 16151.46s]  All right. That's good. I'm happy now. Last chance. Get it. Sorry. All right.
[16152.10s -> 16180.98s]  I'm not playing this one ever again. All right. It's time. We can get rid of the OST.
[16181.78s -> 16185.86s]  That was just to pass a little bit of time while I got 10, you know, 15,000 points.
[16187.06s -> 16196.25s]  I don't think these sliders do anything. Is he, well, I can end it on dizzy bird.
[16196.97s -> 16203.86s]  Do the coin pusher. We'll do coin pusher. All right. I'm at 92,000. I need
[16204.82s -> 16210.89s]  Jeff's about seven and a half thousand more. Good. I want to try this one again,
[16211.53s -> 16218.60s]  but I need money. I want to try that one again. I thought that was a music playing.
[16218.60s -> 16231.88s]  Am I? I thought I, I thought I auto-played a video that Dev is actually here.
[16234.38s -> 16245.48s]  Dev Oatid is actually Dev. Dev Oatid. What's up? We really like your game. It's great.
[16246.44s -> 16265.29s]  That is awesome. I rarely get to watch anymore. Keep adding cool stuff. You, I know,
[16265.29s -> 16272.94s]  I know you've already got three arcades. That's so, it's too addicting and too much fun.
[16273.66s -> 16278.01s]  You know what I mean? Which, which again, what was the coin pusher game that I didn't do?
[16282.07s -> 16292.42s]  It's good as it is. It's great as it is, but I'm a sicko and I need, I'd want more, more.
[16293.38s -> 16303.90s]  He's demanding more, more, more, more. I'll do laser tag because people didn't get to see it.
[16304.54s -> 16323.54s]  We'll go spawn camp. We need more Arthur. He's going to do one more of these Arthur.
[16323.54s -> 16343.37s]  Just one more. I swear this will be it. Don't you say that game sucked? What are you talking about?
[16352.86s -> 16357.53s]  Wait, I'm sorry. It's, it's hard to follow like what, what, what, like we as gamers
[16358.49s -> 16362.65s]  don't and do not like and do not like. Do we not like Red Dead Redemption 2?
[16362.65s -> 16373.74s]  I wasn't, I didn't get the memo on this one. We do? It was okay. It sucked.
[16376.54s -> 16382.39s]  I gotta get on right. All right. It's time to spawn. Oh, I got three shots now. Give me another one.
[16393.72s -> 16399.14s]  Am I crazy or did the dev just subscribe? That's a good question. Maybe. All right.
[16399.30s -> 16404.86s]  Let me, let me get in here. Let's spawn camp the same person. How'd you guys, why are you up there?
[16407.34s -> 16438.39s]  Stop body blocking. Dick. Can I recharge here? Come with me for a second. Come with me for a
[16438.39s -> 16453.19s]  second. Okay. I have an idea. I'm going to bring him over to the recharge station and just get
[16453.67s -> 16465.88s]  points. Not a thousand tickets. That's a lot. Dev is through crew. Pretty good actually.
[16478.71s -> 16521.74s]  All right, stay here. Damn it. He's running away. No rough housing. Yeah.
[16522.70s -> 16541.88s]  It's got moon means. What's that even supposed to mean? No gravity or something. I don't get it.
[16541.88s -> 16580.84s]  Move, move. Time. Moon aim suck. Mars aim is great. Oh, right. This is stronger. Gravitational pull. I get you.
[16587.32s -> 16591.26s]  Thousand points.
[16597.70s -> 16611.74s]  Game over. 1550. Nice. 16 KD. All right. What am I finishing up with? Coin push. You're right.
[16611.74s -> 16615.74s]  Somebody wanted to do coin push. That sounds fun. We'll do that. We'll do the SpongeBob one.
[16617.94s -> 16635.14s]  Or Bird. Duck. Chicken. Um, Dunko. The mermaid one. Yeah. Mermaid one's good. Let's do mermaid one.
[16635.14s -> 16642.02s]  This one's actually, yeah, this one's fun. This one's brand new, by the way. I think this one
[16642.02s -> 16674.07s]  actually came out like last week. Here we go. This thing's primed and ready. Spam. Yeah, let's spam.
[16675.19s -> 16702.95s]  Wow. All right. Stop burger boy technically. That's not helping. We need some nuance here.
[16702.95s -> 16726.76s]  Here we go. Watch this thing go up. Hey, welcome to Twitch. Enjoy your first, like, three hours.
[16727.72s -> 16738.30s]  Holy shit. That's loud. All right. I gotta turn it down. It is way too loud.
[16738.94s -> 16763.67s]  But didn't I already? I did turn it down. Uh-oh. Is it broken? 800 tickets. Let's go right at the
[16763.67s -> 16785.05s]  middle. Bonus. The death is a sub, but thank you. Welcome. Your game is very charming and fun.
[16785.05s -> 16793.64s]  It's a nice change of pace. It's just, you just can play arcade games. Just hang on.
[16794.44s -> 16817.21s]  Give me another bonus. Let's see how close we are. I thought, what, I didn't leave tickets on the
[16817.21s -> 16835.24s]  ground. We're 394,000 tickets. Dizzy bird, please. I will finish with dizzy bird. I promise. Let's do
[16835.24s -> 16868.76s]  this one. The audio is bugged. That's all good. 360. That's pretty good tickets. Let's do it again.
[16869.32s -> 16894.66s]  Two more times. That's it. If I get to 400, then I win. I feel like I was very accurate that time.
[16901.32s -> 16902.76s]  Not going for doubles. It's hard.
[16922.78s -> 16937.75s]  That's the one. Yes. 400. Oh, I'm very excited about this apparently. Okay. It's almost time.
[16940.98s -> 16942.02s]  It's almost time.
[16960.39s -> 16968.20s]  That was it. Those of you that know, you know. If you know, you know. That just went through
[16970.23s -> 16975.19s]  the credit went through and it instantly wasn't a jackpot. Those of you that know, you know.
[16977.02s -> 16981.22s]  It's hard for me to explain that, but you know. All right. Let's go back to the mermaid.
[16981.78s -> 16996.04s]  This should get us there. Let's go right in the middle.
[16996.84s -> 17016.68s]  No, it's here. Can you play the story mode? Holy shit. That was a lot. No, no.
[17025.51s -> 17037.53s]  The story mode is no, it's not accurate. I want to try it when that comes up.
[17038.57s -> 17058.81s]  This might be the biggest win from this machine up on strength. Oh, they all went flat too.
[17058.97s -> 17077.37s]  You'd love to see that. Easy, easy. Spread it out. There it is flat.
[17085.82s -> 17089.88s]  In 10 seconds, somebody prepare the bottom jewelry. Somebody do it.
[17092.31s -> 17125.51s]  Come on. Oh no. I didn't get a bonus. Come on. Right here.
[17133.80s -> 17134.52s]  More credits.
[17143.80s -> 17147.64s]  1200 tickets. We'll do, uh, one more time and I'm just going to spam in the same corner.
[17148.60s -> 17178.33s]  We'll do half or yeah, 50, 60. It's not going to move at all. Meaty if it falls.
[17189.21s -> 17202.55s]  That was cool. That's not a lot of tickets though. I'm not satisfied with that one
[17204.55s -> 17207.35s]  because look at the left side now. All right, we'll do one more. One more real one
[17208.07s -> 17209.99s]  and I'm going to dizzy. Uh, dizzy bird.
[17221.18s -> 17228.14s]  Disney bird. No, dizzy bird, dizzy bird. Look at that left side. That comes over here.
[17237.29s -> 17243.24s]  How ridiculous that is. I need to get it. Look at this shit. There we go.
[17264.89s -> 17273.42s]  Push it. This last one comes because it really does. We look at all these 10s and 20s and 100s
[17278.09s -> 17280.17s]  and then we'll cash in and go dizzy bird.
[17280.17s -> 17316.10s]  Okay. My cat is addicted to watching me play. It's kind of odd. I wonder why.
[17318.90s -> 17331.48s]  Well, I'm addicted to playing this so I'm not a cat or anything, but it's fun.
[17334.50s -> 17346.79s]  These are the best arcade game in real life. Uh, I'm not sure I agree with that. All right.
[17346.79s -> 17349.19s]  What am I getting completed after the stream is over? First thing I will do.
[17349.19s -> 17381.86s]  I promise. Sushi. Okay. All right. More 20. All right. Make this tactical. Look at that left side.
[17383.22s -> 17404.01s]  Tactical. Ah, that's it. We're out. We're out. So where are these tickets on the ground? Everyone
[17404.01s -> 17431.27s]  says it exists. Where are they? Oh, all right. I wanted to help. Fucker. You got it before I did.
[17432.79s -> 17451.85s]  No. Oh, now it's going to be old news when I get it. Thousand tickets. Hello. I would like
[17454.78s -> 17485.62s]  a hover board, please. What color? Blue. Blue. Thank you. Okay. Bye. How do I ride it? I'm going
[17485.62s -> 17514.82s]  to ride it. Whoa. What the fuck? This thing's fast. I can't ride this. Yes, I can. I can ride
[17514.82s -> 17521.93s]  this. Right. Is it not a vehicle? Is Dev still here? Is this a vehicle? Can I ride this?
[17535.75s -> 17544.57s]  Wow. Don't look over there. Not yet. Oh shit. I can't ride this. It's not rideable. Oh no.
[17544.57s -> 17559.27s]  I can't ride it. Yes, I can. I'm riding it right now. How much does it sell for? I don't know.
[17561.43s -> 17565.27s]  Oh no. I saw a kid riding it. There was a kid riding it in here already.
[17566.07s -> 17597.62s]  He gets the working one. I don't mind it having batteries. Where's my limo? I don't see how much
[17597.62s -> 17613.32s]  it's worth. We have stuff in here. All right. How much is it worth? Uh, that better be 19,000.
[17613.32s -> 17634.52s]  What about this other stuff? What are the, uh, what are the ear pods worth? Get rid of these.
[17635.80s -> 17661.94s]  How much are the ducks? How much are the ice cream ducks without the stick? 52? Nah. I know
[17661.94s -> 17670.97s]  what you're worth. All right. I got all my stuff. Ooh. Cheesy poofs. Push here for cheesy poofs.
[17671.77s -> 17705.77s]  Sure. How much are they? $1.50? You're losing $1 per poof. That's okay. My company is operating
[17705.77s -> 17714.92s]  at a loss. That's normal. My company have buy cheesy poofs and sell to the thing next to me.
[17715.56s -> 17724.44s]  I'll just go get a loan from a bank of $500,000. Pay myself a salary of 50 grand.
[17725.32s -> 17733.90s]  Burn the rest of it. That's what you do, right? I didn't even touch it. I didn't even come close.
[17738.39s -> 17745.26s]  Now I want the lightsaber. Now I want the lightsaber. The hover board doesn't work.
[17745.26s -> 17753.94s]  I want the lightsaber. Go get the lottery tickets. Um, where can you even get the
[17753.94s -> 17758.81s]  lottery tickets? I don't remember. Is it here? No, it's not. Where is it?
[17763.29s -> 17768.68s]  Gas station. There we go. All right. All right. Do I think the lightsaber works? No,
[17768.68s -> 17771.00s]  the lightsaber different doesn't work, but it definitely makes like a
[17771.00s -> 17786.63s]  zoom. Guaranteed. Y'all know that's true. Hey, everybody's saying, dude, what the
[17786.63s -> 17794.42s]  fuck? This is not a Christmas stream. It is now. They're happy. Merry Christmas.
[17794.98s -> 17833.74s]  Are there any new machines in here? I remember this part. I got the ticket back. Whatever.
[17835.24s -> 17838.60s]  No, I'm not going to sit here for an hour or two like I did last time. I promise.
[17839.56s -> 17845.26s]  I just want to see what it was all about. I just want to see what it was all about.
[17845.98s -> 17890.95s]  One more fish. Come on, fish. Spoiled brat.
[17893.03s -> 17896.30s]  All right. I'm going to end it with dizzy bird and then I'm going to play
[17896.30s -> 17913.30s]  elf bowling for like 10 minutes. Let's go dizzy bird time. Get the fireworks.
[17914.02s -> 17925.93s]  Yeah, I did the fireworks last time. No, you can't do this twice. I know it's my birthday.
[17925.93s -> 17933.53s]  Happy birthday. Really? I knew the surprise was coming. Unbelievable. I can't believe you guys.
[17934.25s -> 17963.62s]  Why wouldn't you surprise me? I'm going to do this until I have no more money.
[17963.62s -> 17972.39s]  What is it? Two bucks? All right. No, I'm going to do it 10 times. That was one.
[17972.39s -> 17984.62s]  That was not even close. How did I get a penny? Yeah, where did a penny come from?
[17985.42s -> 17997.03s]  That seems out of place. That's too far. That's too hard to gauge.
[18002.10s -> 18006.54s]  That's too far to gauge. You need the one that's close. It's in the same spot. Great.
[18006.54s -> 18030.46s]  At least I get a bonus. Right there. Right there. How many was that? Four?
[18030.46s -> 18054.12s]  This is the one. This is the best one to do. It wasn't even close. Not even close.
[18056.42s -> 18064.26s]  Not even close. That's okay. I've already beaten it. All right. Three more. This is
[18064.26s -> 18071.61s]  memory. I'm serious. I'm only doing this 10 times. What the fuck do I keep messing up?
[18074.81s -> 18095.86s]  It's all right. Two more. Last one. Incoming. Where's the light?
[18110.57s -> 18119.99s]  Are you fucking kidding me? I almost got it. There it is. The final one.
[18119.99s -> 18135.24s]  I'm leaving without you. I'm leaving without you. What is going on with you?
[18138.73s -> 18143.45s]  All right. That's it. That's Dizzy Bird. That's the end. Now we're going to move on.
[18144.41s -> 18148.87s]  We're going to drink a Mountain Dew. And that is it for the game.
[18151.21s -> 18160.22s]  Until the next update. Whenever that happens. Now we're going to do elf bowling. Where's the trash?
[18164.62s -> 18175.88s]  There is no trash. That was good. That's a pretty substantial update.
[18176.36s -> 18184.33s]  You got a whole new arcade. You got a house with a duck in it and everything. That's pretty cool.
[18187.40s -> 18210.86s]  Yeah. I'm going to transition to elf bowling. I have to end the stream the same way I ended
[18210.86s -> 18234.28s]  the last one. Hey, somebody just fucking hit me. I was just told somebody was Bowser.
[18235.00s -> 18255.32s]  I'll take one. I'll take two. All right. We got two of these. Where are they? Here.
[18255.96s -> 18288.82s]  Okay. Well, pick it up. Watch out. Put it in the golf cart and drive around. I don't think it'll
[18288.82s -> 18303.37s]  stay. I'll try. Damn it. I kind of want to do like 20 of these in the golf cart. Can I do that?
[18309.21s -> 18314.02s]  No way. Not one will barely fit in here. Is it facing the right way?
[18324.98s -> 18343.26s]  Drive. Drive. I drove the cart into the water last time too. Yeah. That's what I have to do.
[18344.22s -> 18347.26s]  There's a fail. Well, I can't drive over this for some reason.
[18353.59s -> 18407.53s]  Come on. Why can I not drive over this? Is it patched? Yeah, we're good. I'm still going.
[18408.57s -> 18434.39s]  Still going. Still going. Still going. Still going. Go. Keep going. Keep going. Go. More. More.
[18445.06s -> 18480.36s]  I'm not pressing any buttons. There it is. The end of the world. Oh, I didn't save the game.
[18491.51s -> 18496.68s]  Remind me that if I play this game again, I don't have any more gas and I need to walk back to...
[18497.48s -> 18503.38s]  Can you die? No, I can teleport. I can teleport. All right. Elf Balling time to end the stream.
[18503.38s -> 18508.42s]  Merry Christmas, everybody. If you've taken off, we'll see when I get back. I'm going to be taking
[18508.42s -> 18515.34s]  a few days off for the holiday. Please continue to nominate and discuss the end of the year stuff
[18515.34s -> 18525.14s]  that's not turning off. I will see you guys on Friday the 27th. If you celebrate Christmas,
[18526.10s -> 18532.25s]  happy Christmas, happy holidays. Whatever you happen to be celebrating, happy holidays to you.
[18533.37s -> 18547.05s]  I'll be back on Friday. And now let's do Elf Bowling. And if you were curious, yes,
[18547.61s -> 18596.95s]  it's already here ready to go. It is. I didn't know they were naked. How do you play? Oh, like
[18596.95s -> 18611.34s]  that. X. This is the first game I ever played. Is it really? I feel like it's at times 10 speed.
[18613.59s -> 18628.38s]  Why is it sounds so fast? Strike. Let me get to in a row. There it is.
[18632.38s -> 18639.10s]  It's my processor is going too fast. Did it just, did it just cut off somebody's head?
[18640.06s -> 18646.90s]  I don't remember doing that. It just ripped his head off.
[18653.42s -> 18658.98s]  God, that was three strikes in a row. Elf Bowling Dev in chat.
[18660.98s -> 18666.02s]  No way, because I don't think this game came out like 30 years ago.
[18669.75s -> 18673.38s]  Sorry, something came on the screen. I had to try to throw something. I don't know why.
[18673.38s -> 18687.72s]  How old is this game? I don't know. When did the internet come out? 1997? 1996?
[18690.92s -> 18694.20s]  I think I could probably get at least four or five strikes in a row if I try hard.
[18697.83s -> 18708.94s]  I gotta use my right hand. That's a spare.
[18712.14s -> 18714.30s]  You thought the game broke when the elf's head came off.
[18716.76s -> 18720.92s]  This game was completely showered in controversy, if you don't know.
[18721.96s -> 18725.56s]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the original version of this game was a virus.
[18728.49s -> 18734.18s]  Right? It was, wasn't it? The original version of this game was a virus.
[18740.09s -> 18748.58s]  Hold on. I need to confirm. Can somebody look it up?
[18753.45s -> 18754.25s]  It's definitely sped up.
[18758.47s -> 18762.79s]  Let's do quit. Elf Bowling, let's do Elf Bowling 2.
[18769.06s -> 18770.50s]  Elves in Paradise.
[18775.98s -> 18780.46s]  Okay, I need to be clear. This doesn't show his elf dick, right? Tell me that's not true.
[18782.79s -> 18785.19s]  I don't want to get an elf dick. Okay, there's probably an elf dick in this.
[18792.68s -> 18804.62s]  It's shuffleboard. Don't pull your fucking underwear down.
[18804.62s -> 18823.40s]  All right, I'm out of here. Don't pull your fucking elf underwear down, don't you fucking dare.
[18823.40s -> 18829.83s]  Don't. I gotta go right up this way.
[18830.63s -> 18837.42s]  It wasn't a virus, by the way. It wasn't?
[18844.46s -> 18849.37s]  There's an elf dick. Play something else. I don't think there is.
[18856.39s -> 18860.58s]  300. They made a movie based on this?
[18861.38s -> 18873.38s]  If you have received elf bowling or frogapult games on the internet.
[18873.38s -> 18874.74s]  Spam that again. I can't. I didn't see it.
[18882.52s -> 18888.06s]  It's awful. If you've received elf bowling or frogapult games that have been circling the
[18888.06s -> 18892.14s]  internet and no one has, they must be deleted before Christmas Day. They contain viruses that
[18892.14s -> 18895.90s]  is to go off on Christmas Day and will delete your hard drive. That wasn't real?
[18896.78s -> 18909.30s]  It was a hoax. I don't know.
[18910.42s -> 18915.08s]  How am I supposed to know? I was probably like 12 years old.
[18918.82s -> 18921.38s]  It still is. You have less than 24 hours to delete this.
[18922.87s -> 18926.02s]  I don't want to play this anymore. I'm done.
[18926.02s -> 18942.82s]  How is this elf bowling 2? Elf bowling movie IMDB link.
[18943.62s -> 18946.01s]  Is there a trailer for the movie? I can watch that, right?
[18946.01s -> 18948.25s]  That's not like against the rules. I want to watch the trailer.
[18949.05s -> 18952.68s]  Yeah, let's watch the trailer for elf bowling the movie.
[18964.47s -> 18967.77s]  You're dead. This is the last round.
[18967.77s -> 18984.50s]  All right. I'm done. Forget about polar bowler.
[18988.82s -> 18992.79s]  All right. That was fun. You thought I was going to do that for less than 10 minutes?
[18995.21s -> 18997.53s]  More than 10 minutes? No way. Not a million years.
[18999.38s -> 19007.62s]  I want to watch the elf bowling movie trailer. Elf bowling the movie.
[19012.68s -> 19025.26s]  All right. Let's watch it. Please rate your ad experience.
[19025.26s -> 19028.90s]  Oh, shut up. Yeah. I hate it.
[19030.01s -> 19032.89s]  All right. Elf bowling trailer. 10 years ago?
[19036.84s -> 19042.46s]  This trailer is in like a terrible 480p trailer. This is okay.
[19043.34s -> 19052.60s]  Let's go. Yeah. Okay. Ready?
[19064.84s -> 19068.20s]  Put all them creature stolen toys in me cabin.
[19068.20s -> 19072.68s]  First of all, I just got to say an episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
[19073.40s -> 19076.44s]  has which is about the same amount of animation quality.
[19079.03s -> 19084.63s]  Could it be that a long, long time ago, Santa started out as a pirate
[19084.63s -> 19088.39s]  and wound up kicked off his own ship? It's him.
[19088.39s -> 19092.07s]  And what do you lads do in this wondrous place?
[19092.07s -> 19099.35s]  See for yourself. It's a magical and mystical marvelous world.
[19100.31s -> 19103.59s]  It doesn't even fit up. It doesn't even fit up.
[19109.75s -> 19112.55s]  You're going to call me the Madagascar Penguins?
[19118.55s -> 19122.55s]  Are we sure this is not an iPad ad for an iPad game?
[19129.35s -> 19132.79s]  The Elf Bowling, the movie.
[19133.83s -> 19138.55s]  This is like a chick flick, except instead of smoking babes, dude,
[19139.19s -> 19141.03s]  it's a bunch getting a fat guy.
[19145.40s -> 19148.28s]  Is this movie in public domain? Can we watch this movie on stream?
[19148.28s -> 19157.66s]  I would. Wait, what? There's a second movie? No, there's not.
[19167.66s -> 19175.75s]  No, no, that's not real. Is it in public domain?
[19177.80s -> 19186.87s]  No way. Who owns the rights to Elf Bowling, the movie?
[19190.95s -> 19193.75s]  The Wikipedia article for it has been marked for deletion.
[19199.82s -> 19201.50s]  That's the nail in the coffin right there.
[19203.08s -> 19207.96s]  That's so funny. Well, we have to watch it before it gets deleted from the world.
[19209.46s -> 19213.10s]  If it's not on Wikipedia, then it doesn't exist.
[19214.49s -> 19216.25s]  Buy the rights to the Elf Bowling movie.
[19216.25s -> 19217.85s]  It's probably way more expensive than you think.
[19219.94s -> 19224.50s]  I would not be surprised if the rights to Elf Bowling and Elf Bowling, the movie,
[19224.50s -> 19230.90s]  all Elf Bowling intellectual property is less than two to three hundred thousand dollars.
[19231.54s -> 19233.86s]  It's probably like five hundred thousand dollars.
[19241.14s -> 19245.99s]  Imagine doing a Kickstarter for like a million dollars.
[19247.13s -> 19250.49s]  And the goal of Kickstarter is for me to get enough money to
[19250.49s -> 19256.74s]  buy out and own the IP of Elf Bowling. But what would I do?
[19261.69s -> 19264.09s]  It was six and a half million dollars to make that movie.
[19264.09s -> 19266.65s]  There's no way I could afford to buy Elf Bowling's IP.
[19268.46s -> 19271.50s]  To watch it on stream. To watch the movie on stream.
[19275.02s -> 19277.18s]  Buy it to put it in the public domain.
[19287.38s -> 19287.70s]  God.
[19289.96s -> 19293.27s]  Anyways, that's going to wrap up the stream.
[19293.91s -> 19296.54s]  I'm going to get some food. That was a lot of fun.
[19301.21s -> 19303.05s]  Hopefully you guys have a good Christmas.
[19303.61s -> 19308.76s]  I'll see you guys on Friday.
[19309.72s -> 19312.60s]  For... I don't know.
[19313.56s -> 19314.12s]  I don't know.
[19318.65s -> 19319.93s]  What the hell? What the hell?
[19320.73s -> 19321.45s]  Nancy Drew?
[19327.90s -> 19328.40s]  No.
[19330.82s -> 19336.33s]  No, no, no, no.
[19339.14s -> 19340.26s]  Yes. No.
[19340.26s -> 19340.82s]  May we'll see.
[19341.54s -> 19344.18s]  We'll see if it depends on how good my Christmas was.
[19344.18s -> 19346.10s]  If I had a really great Christmas,
[19346.10s -> 19348.58s]  then maybe we'll do Nancy Drew post Christmas stream.
[19350.34s -> 19352.98s]  If I had, if I didn't like my, if I didn't have fun on Christmas,
[19353.94s -> 19355.38s]  then we'll do The Surge 2.
[19356.26s -> 19360.49s]  I got to stop saying I'm going to play The Surge 2 because
[19362.87s -> 19364.39s]  I don't want to do that.
[19369.30s -> 19369.80s]  Anywho.
[19370.98s -> 19372.58s]  Let's do the bits and the subs and everything.
[19373.22s -> 19374.58s]  What about Disco Elsium?
[19374.58s -> 19376.02s]  Ah, that's another thing I was thinking of.
[19378.71s -> 19379.21s]  We'll see.
[19380.34s -> 19380.84s]  We'll see.
[19381.38s -> 19384.34s]  See you guys on Friday.
[19384.90s -> 19386.44s]  Have a great holiday.
[19388.18s -> 19390.34s]  If you haven't yet, I want to make sure I keep reiterating this.
[19391.66s -> 19395.66s]  Go to the Discord and check out the nominations channel for the New Year's Eve stream.
[19396.38s -> 19397.26s]  Nominate something.
[19397.26s -> 19399.74s]  If you see one of those categories, go to the discussion channel.
[19399.74s -> 19401.18s]  There's a pinned message.
[19401.18s -> 19401.98s]  Discuss it.
[19401.98s -> 19402.86s]  Nominate.
[19402.86s -> 19403.74s]  Nominate stuff.
[19404.38s -> 19404.94s]  If you want.
[19405.82s -> 19406.94s]  It is currently available.
[19406.94s -> 19410.54s]  It is going to stop the day that I come back.
[19414.07s -> 19415.43s]  Friday the 27th.
[19417.16s -> 19420.28s]  As of probably, I don't know, Friday night.
[19420.28s -> 19422.12s]  As of the stream turning off on Friday.
[19424.12s -> 19425.48s]  That's it for nominations.
[19426.04s -> 19430.41s]  And then the voting is going to start the next day.
[19430.41s -> 19432.33s]  Literally the next day for three days.
[19433.21s -> 19436.02s]  You will have three full days to cast your vote.
[19436.02s -> 19438.74s]  And then, obviously, on the 31st, we have to go over them.
[19441.90s -> 19444.78s]  I'll be talking about it every single stream leading up to the 31st.
[19445.58s -> 19448.84s]  The day I come back is the last day that you can nominate something.
[19449.48s -> 19452.34s]  Check it out.
[19452.34s -> 19457.58s]  Let's do the bits.
[19461.99s -> 19462.47s]  Be good.
[19462.47s -> 19466.44s]  Yeah, I hope Santa is good to you guys this year.
[19469.32s -> 19472.60s]  Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.
[19474.09s -> 19474.89s]  We had Dark Soul.
[19474.89s -> 19476.09s]  Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.
[19477.48s -> 19479.96s]  I'm here from Gap Gaming with your first paycheck.
[19480.92s -> 19482.68s]  We're really looking forward to sponsoring more streams,
[19482.68s -> 19486.60s]  but keep in mind these bits confirm your agreement to our exclusivity deal.
[19486.60s -> 19488.68s]  You can only wear Gap brand clothes on stream,
[19488.68s -> 19491.08s]  and you must now refer to your viewers as Gappers.
[19491.64s -> 19493.16s]  Thanks, and have a great stream.
[19493.16s -> 19494.76s]  Imagine doing that for $2.50.
[19497.78s -> 19500.58s]  Add four zeros, and maybe I'll think about it.
[19500.58s -> 19505.38s]  25, 250, 2500, 125,000, 250.
[19505.38s -> 19506.74s]  All right, that's $2.5 million.
[19507.78s -> 19509.30s]  I thought it was a little bit less than that.
[19509.30s -> 19509.94s]  All right, never mind.
[19511.42s -> 19513.02s]  Hey, Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.
[19513.02s -> 19514.46s]  Hi, I'm here from Gap Gaming.
[19514.46s -> 19515.50s]  Wait, what?
[19515.50s -> 19516.46s]  Why is it happening twice?
[19518.73s -> 19523.05s]  It's not, it's the same one, but I don't know why it doesn't make any sense.
[19524.71s -> 19526.39s]  Hey, it's me from Gap Gaming again.
[19526.39s -> 19529.67s]  Hey, a triple, triple zero Neo, thanks for the 250.
[19530.39s -> 19531.83s]  Chicken Game or Riot, I did.
[19532.55s -> 19533.67s]  Played it a few times, actually.
[19534.39s -> 19538.23s]  What about Community Night?
[19538.95s -> 19540.47s]  Yeah, Community Night got screwed up,
[19540.47s -> 19542.87s]  because I was supposed to go in front of the green screen
[19542.87s -> 19545.27s]  before the third one happened,
[19545.91s -> 19549.19s]  and I ended up having to push the green screen until further notice,
[19549.19s -> 19551.11s]  until I start to go to the physical therapy,
[19551.11s -> 19554.39s]  and it got a little botched.
[19554.39s -> 19557.83s]  So that's still going to have to sit on the burner for another couple weeks, probably.
[19558.79s -> 19560.95s]  But I'm no longer going to wait.
[19561.75s -> 19567.43s]  I'm not going to wait anymore to do Community Content Night 3.
[19569.66s -> 19572.46s]  So it'll probably happen at some point in the middle of January,
[19572.46s -> 19574.06s]  first or second week of January.
[19574.06s -> 19577.55s]  That's that.
[19578.27s -> 19579.31s]  But thank you, triple zero.
[19580.11s -> 19581.32s]  We did play the Chicken Game.
[19582.20s -> 19584.20s]  Martin had a meme, thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[19584.20s -> 19585.56s]  $20 from Martin had a meme.
[19586.36s -> 19588.33s]  Thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[19589.05s -> 19592.04s]  This was the game where you had your scratch ticket stream idea,
[19592.04s -> 19594.68s]  and I'd like to one-up that by saying you should buy a bunch of scratch
[19594.68s -> 19596.36s]  and sniff cards and smell them on stream.
[19598.36s -> 19600.70s]  Well, the scratch card thing got fucked up,
[19600.70s -> 19604.14s]  because I didn't know that Nevada doesn't have a state lottery.
[19605.02s -> 19607.58s]  So I'm like, we're going to scratch $200
[19608.06s -> 19612.00s]  worth of scratch tickets for every death in Sekiro.
[19612.00s -> 19615.36s]  And it's like, oh, sorry, turns out there are no scratch tickets in Nevada.
[19615.36s -> 19616.00s]  They don't exist.
[19616.00s -> 19617.20s]  There's no such thing.
[19617.20s -> 19619.71s]  There's no state lottery in Nevada.
[19619.71s -> 19622.51s]  And I was like, all right, well, maybe I'll have somebody send me
[19623.23s -> 19628.04s]  buy $300 worth of scratch tickets and send them to me from like Massachusetts.
[19628.60s -> 19629.80s]  Nobody wants to fucking do that.
[19630.36s -> 19636.24s]  Hey, can you buy $300 worth of scratch tickets and mail them to me and I'll pay you?
[19636.24s -> 19638.12s]  It's like, leave me alone, Jeremy.
[19638.84s -> 19642.35s]  Go to California, fly to California.
[19647.08s -> 19648.36s]  That's a lie stream.
[19648.92s -> 19650.12s]  No, that's not fair.
[19650.12s -> 19651.08s]  That's not a lie.
[19651.08s -> 19652.52s]  I can't, I couldn't do it.
[19654.35s -> 19656.67s]  I don't know that Nevada, I've only been here for a year.
[19656.67s -> 19658.11s]  I didn't know that I couldn't do that.
[19660.80s -> 19661.92s]  It's not a lie.
[19661.92s -> 19664.88s]  If you attempt to do something and you get legally, you can't.
[19668.28s -> 19669.16s]  Okay, sure.
[19669.16s -> 19670.20s]  Sorry, I didn't.
[19670.20s -> 19680.06s]  Sorry, I didn't get on an airplane to go to California to buy scratch tickets.
[19680.06s -> 19681.74s]  Isn't California right across the border?
[19682.30s -> 19684.62s]  Um, yeah, it's like a four hour drive.
[19687.45s -> 19691.29s]  That's, that's an eight plus hour trip to go get scratch tickets.
[19697.56s -> 19698.60s]  That's not long.
[19699.24s -> 19701.16s]  That's a long ass time in a car.
[19706.11s -> 19707.79s]  And it's not even, that's not just eight hours.
[19708.43s -> 19710.75s]  That's four hours plus to get there.
[19711.31s -> 19713.87s]  That's without traffic in California.
[19714.43s -> 19720.27s]  Once I get into California, I'm, what am I just going to drive to the border?
[19720.91s -> 19726.51s]  Take a step over the border and find the first gas station and buy $300 worth of scratch tickets.
[19726.51s -> 19729.31s]  The first gas, they're going to call the police on me.
[19734.17s -> 19737.29s]  Wouldn't that turn around and drive back over the, that's,
[19742.06s -> 19744.38s]  is it weird that I'm scared to do that?
[19744.38s -> 19747.42s]  Imagine if I got pulled over, like going over the border to Nevada.
[19748.52s -> 19750.60s]  Sir, I see that you just pulled into a gas station.
[19751.16s -> 19752.20s]  Yeah, I did.
[19752.20s -> 19753.64s]  Can I take a look inside your car here?
[19754.60s -> 19755.32s]  Uh, yeah.
[19755.32s -> 19756.68s]  What are these scratch tickets doing here?
[19756.92s -> 19758.28s]  I know it's not illegal.
[19766.00s -> 19769.28s]  It's not illegal to scratch scratch tickets in another state.
[19769.28s -> 19770.96s]  I'm just, it's not illegal.
[19772.88s -> 19775.36s]  Look, I'm going to, let's, let's be, no, I did.
[19775.36s -> 19781.15s]  I did not drive three, four, five hours across the border to get scratch tickets.
[19782.51s -> 19783.39s]  I'm sorry.
[19783.39s -> 19784.35s]  I didn't do that.
[19790.62s -> 19791.10s]  How about this?
[19791.10s -> 19792.94s]  The next time, it's going to be a lie.
[19793.66s -> 19795.92s]  The next time I'm in California, this is a lie.
[19795.92s -> 19797.04s]  Why would I even say this?
[19797.04s -> 19802.40s]  The next, the next time I'm in California, which I go a few times a year, stuff like E3,
[19803.28s -> 19807.36s]  Twitch con, you know, the next time I'm in, I'm in California, I'm going to buy
[19807.36s -> 19809.68s]  300 fucking dollars worth scratch tickets.
[19809.68s -> 19811.76s]  And, but then I'm going to get searched at TSA.
[19811.76s -> 19812.96s]  They're going to be like, what's this guy doing?
[19813.92s -> 19818.40s]  Why is, is, is this guy so addicted to gambling that he goes to a,
[19818.40s -> 19825.64s]  on a trip to Los Angeles and buys a like 50 scratch tickets and it's in his bag.
[19825.64s -> 19830.36s]  He's going, where's, what's his, what's, where's his ticket to Las Vegas?
[19831.76s -> 19836.48s]  This dude's going back to Las Vegas with like 75 scratch tickets.
[19836.48s -> 19839.53s]  I'm going to get searched.
[19839.53s -> 19848.19s]  I'm going to be like, okay, what are you doing here?
[19848.19s -> 19853.45s]  Guys, you know, if you walk off the airplane in the Las Vegas airport,
[19853.45s -> 19855.61s]  there's a slot machine right when you get out of the terminal,
[19855.61s -> 19856.73s]  they're going to be like, what are you doing?
[19858.22s -> 19859.18s]  Mail them to yourself.
[19873.36s -> 19875.04s]  Yes, I'd like to send a package please.
[19875.04s -> 19875.60s]  Oh, okay.
[19875.60s -> 19878.96s]  I welcome to welcome to like the UPS store.
[19878.96s -> 19880.32s]  Welcome to the USPS office.
[19880.32s -> 19881.68s]  Welcome to FedEx store.
[19881.68s -> 19882.48s]  How can I help you?
[19883.20s -> 19885.76s]  Yeah, I'd like to mail a hundred scratch tickets to myself.
[19886.64s -> 19888.72s]  Oh, you're insane.
[19888.72s -> 19889.20s]  Sure thing.
[19889.20s -> 19889.92s]  It's your money.
[19899.23s -> 19899.95s]  Where do you live?
[19900.67s -> 19901.47s]  Las Vegas.
[19902.03s -> 19902.43s]  Okay.
[19912.44s -> 19913.40s]  Just buy the stamp.
[19913.40s -> 19914.76s]  You don't have to tell him what you're sending.
[19914.76s -> 19916.20s]  Yeah, but I'm fucking crazy.
[19917.16s -> 19918.36s]  I know it's in that box.
[19918.36s -> 19920.36s]  And I'm going to be like, there's scratch tickets in there.
[19920.36s -> 19922.68s]  Like, I don't know.
[19922.68s -> 19923.40s]  I'm a weirdo.
[19924.20s -> 19925.69s]  Oh, yeah.
[19925.69s -> 19925.85s]  Here.
[19925.85s -> 19927.13s]  I'm just sending out a package.
[19927.93s -> 19928.25s]  Okay.
[19928.25s -> 19928.89s]  Yeah.
[19928.89s -> 19929.37s]  Thank you.
[19929.37s -> 19929.85s]  That's it.
[19929.85s -> 19931.37s]  That's all our conversation has to be.
[19931.37s -> 19932.73s]  Yes, scratch tickets in there.
[19932.73s -> 19933.93s]  What the heck?
[19933.93s -> 19934.97s]  What am I doing?
[19936.20s -> 19936.84s]  Okay.
[19936.84s -> 19937.24s]  Yes.
[19937.24s -> 19937.88s]  Have a good day.
[19953.20s -> 19954.88s]  You're an oblivion NPC.
[19960.99s -> 19968.89s]  I just have to say everything I'm doing and walk in there.
[19969.77s -> 19971.21s]  Well, cool door.
[19971.21s -> 19972.01s]  Interesting door.
[19972.97s -> 19973.45s]  Howdy.
[19973.45s -> 19974.01s]  How are you?
[19974.65s -> 19974.97s]  Hi.
[19976.06s -> 19976.46s]  Wow.
[19977.10s -> 19978.54s]  Scratch tickets in this box.
[19979.82s -> 19980.30s]  How much?
[19981.02s -> 19981.50s]  Howdy.
[19982.22s -> 19982.86s]  How are you?
[19990.41s -> 19991.61s]  You're a math problem.
[19999.20s -> 20000.56s]  That's not an oblivion NPC.
[20000.56s -> 20002.40s]  That's a shitty, that's a bad let's player.
[20009.76s -> 20011.76s]  Yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty good.
[20011.76s -> 20012.56s]  That's pretty good.
[20012.56s -> 20016.76s]  Anyways, scratch and sniff cards.
[20016.76s -> 20017.88s]  But you can't smell them.
[20017.88s -> 20019.16s]  How could, why would that work?
[20040.54s -> 20041.18s]  I can't.
[20042.14s -> 20048.24s]  All right.
[20049.28s -> 20049.76s]  All right.
[20050.48s -> 20052.00s]  I'm gonna, let's go.
[20052.72s -> 20054.59s]  Let's go.
[20055.15s -> 20055.87s]  Let's go.
[20055.87s -> 20056.59s]  Let's go.
[20056.59s -> 20057.87s]  We got, we got.
[20059.31s -> 20060.03s]  Let's go.
[20060.03s -> 20060.59s]  Let's go.
[20060.59s -> 20060.99s]  Let's go.
[20060.99s -> 20062.99s]  It's four hours to Los Angeles.
[20062.99s -> 20063.31s]  All right.
[20064.11s -> 20065.95s]  It's like a five hour drive.
[20065.95s -> 20066.35s]  All right.
[20074.19s -> 20077.31s]  How dare you prove me wrong and embarrass me on my own stream?
[20078.03s -> 20078.83s]  How dare you?
[20088.72s -> 20090.24s]  Road trip stream.
[20099.39s -> 20101.31s]  No, I'm not doing a driving stream.
[20101.31s -> 20102.03s]  Are you crazy?
[20115.05s -> 20115.85s]  Desert bus.
[20119.20s -> 20119.52s]  Don't.
[20119.52s -> 20121.60s]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna do a driving.
[20121.60s -> 20125.44s]  If I go, if I go anywhere, it's not gonna be on stream.
[20126.32s -> 20134.28s]  All right.
[20134.28s -> 20134.68s]  We gotta move.
[20134.68s -> 20135.08s]  We gotta go.
[20135.08s -> 20135.40s]  We gotta go.
[20135.40s -> 20135.80s]  We gotta go.
[20135.80s -> 20136.12s]  We gotta go.
[20136.12s -> 20136.44s]  We gotta go.
[20136.44s -> 20136.84s]  We gotta go.
[20136.84s -> 20138.52s]  We gotta move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[20138.52s -> 20139.08s]  It's Christmas.
[20139.08s -> 20139.32s]  Come on.
[20139.32s -> 20140.28s]  People got places to go.
[20141.24s -> 20143.37s]  Where were we?
[20143.37s -> 20144.33s]  All right.
[20144.33s -> 20146.01s]  Martin had a meme thanks to the 2,000 bits.
[20146.57s -> 20148.09s]  Scratch and sniff would be pretty cool,
[20148.09s -> 20149.61s]  except you guys can't smell it.
[20149.61s -> 20150.49s]  That'd be unfortunate.
[20151.29s -> 20152.67s]  Hey, Jay Bong.
[20152.67s -> 20153.71s]  Thanks for the 250.
[20154.59s -> 20155.84s]  What's up, Jerma?
[20155.84s -> 20157.36s]  I haven't been able to catch your streams for three days.
[20157.36s -> 20160.00s]  Gonna spend my time dealing with a huge sprained ankle.
[20160.88s -> 20164.08s]  No, knowing how to ice skate plus sketchy rental skates
[20164.08s -> 20165.12s]  don't look a good combo.
[20166.24s -> 20166.72s]  That hurts.
[20168.43s -> 20170.43s]  My ankle plumped up like a mango
[20170.43s -> 20172.99s]  and I'm bed bound for four to seven weeks.
[20172.99s -> 20173.79s]  Oh my God.
[20176.73s -> 20177.77s]  That's a long time.
[20178.49s -> 20181.98s]  The doc said it was a grade three sprain.
[20182.62s -> 20185.66s]  At least I'll be able to catch your famous yearly Christmas stream, right?
[20186.54s -> 20188.44s]  Should we tell him?
[20189.00s -> 20194.92s]  There's no Christmas stream this year.
[20195.48s -> 20196.60s]  It's the New Year's Eve stream.
[20199.04s -> 20202.88s]  You ever had a deal with a sprain ankle or sprained limb on a first timer?
[20202.88s -> 20203.60s]  No, not really.
[20205.45s -> 20210.57s]  I've had minor sprains, you know, minor twists on the ankle
[20210.57s -> 20212.25s]  or, you know, on a wrist or something,
[20212.25s -> 20215.45s]  but never something that put me in bed for like seven weeks.
[20216.25s -> 20220.49s]  Have you ever broken a bone?
[20221.05s -> 20221.29s]  No.
[20222.03s -> 20222.99s]  Well, no, that's not true.
[20222.99s -> 20226.36s]  I broke my collarbone when I was two years old.
[20227.08s -> 20231.24s]  I fell off a chair and shattered my collarbone.
[20231.24s -> 20234.65s]  I don't remember.
[20234.65s -> 20235.29s]  I don't know it.
[20235.29s -> 20235.93s]  I don't remember it.
[20235.93s -> 20236.65s]  I just know what happened.
[20242.40s -> 20242.72s]  Wimp?
[20243.60s -> 20247.36s]  Jesus.
[20247.36s -> 20248.16s]  Weak bones.
[20248.80s -> 20249.52s]  That's two.
[20254.52s -> 20256.28s]  The very first fall joke.
[20263.08s -> 20264.52s]  Thank you, Jay Blondell.
[20264.52s -> 20265.08s]  I've never had a...
[20265.08s -> 20266.76s]  I hope you get a swift recovery to you.
[20267.40s -> 20270.28s]  I've never had a broken bone like that or a sprained ankle.
[20270.28s -> 20271.72s]  It sounds like it's not very fun.
[20272.76s -> 20275.63s]  I cracked my skull open when I was four.
[20275.63s -> 20276.43s]  Beat that scrub.
[20276.43s -> 20277.07s]  I did that too.
[20278.67s -> 20281.31s]  I actually talked about that on stream when I was talking to Joel.
[20282.11s -> 20283.31s]  I did that too.
[20283.31s -> 20284.27s]  So you can't...
[20284.27s -> 20285.15s]  There's no one out there.
[20286.19s -> 20287.07s]  You and I are the same.
[20287.79s -> 20289.58s]  Sorry.
[20291.31s -> 20292.27s]  Hey, Yosher.
[20292.27s -> 20293.39s]  Master, thanks for the 500 bits.
[20293.39s -> 20295.07s]  Jerma, can you sort these bits for me?
[20295.07s -> 20297.47s]  Please lend me some of your processing power, Jerma IQ.
[20299.15s -> 20299.47s]  Sure.
[20300.11s -> 20306.97s]  Did you get some of that?
[20307.69s -> 20308.57s]  I released some.
[20315.05s -> 20316.49s]  That's what I was doing, the sorting algorithm.
[20317.52s -> 20318.32s]  You didn't get any?
[20318.32s -> 20319.04s]  Well, they went for you.
[20320.00s -> 20325.18s]  Can we do sorting algorithms one more time?
[20325.18s -> 20325.58s]  I'll do...
[20325.58s -> 20325.74s]  No.
[20327.90s -> 20331.02s]  Thank you, Yosher Master, and enjoy the Jerma IQ power.
[20338.08s -> 20341.12s]  Thank you, Nickly Bob for the thousand bits.
[20342.16s -> 20342.72s]  Thank you, Bob.
[20343.36s -> 20345.61s]  Ten dollars.
[20345.61s -> 20347.61s]  It's really nice to relax to your streams after work.
[20347.61s -> 20347.93s]  Thank you.
[20348.81s -> 20350.25s]  Glad you can hang out and relax.
[20353.60s -> 20354.32s]  Glad you can chill.
[20359.74s -> 20360.46s]  Glad you can chill.
[20362.27s -> 20363.87s]  Cold War Hall gave ten community subs.
[20363.87s -> 20364.19s]  Thank you.
[20364.75s -> 20366.11s]  Ampharic ten community subs.
[20366.11s -> 20367.39s]  I think we caught them, but seriously...
[20367.39s -> 20367.87s]  What's this?
[20367.87s -> 20368.59s]  Oh, let me mix...
[20368.59s -> 20369.07s]  Let me see.
[20369.07s -> 20369.55s]  Okay.
[20369.55s -> 20370.59s]  I want to see how bad this is.
[20371.76s -> 20373.68s]  Because I literally...
[20373.68s -> 20374.24s]  People would...
[20374.24s -> 20376.00s]  Like I said, people wanted to burn my house down for this one.
[20376.00s -> 20376.80s]  Let me see how bad this is.
[20379.40s -> 20384.36s]  I've never looked over and seen chat tell me how much they want me to fucking...
[20385.00s -> 20385.64s]  You know what I mean?
[20386.28s -> 20387.24s]  How bad was it?
[20387.24s -> 20390.38s]  Why'd it give me a bonus?
[20390.38s -> 20394.28s]  Jerma, you've been playing the chicken game since July.
[20394.28s -> 20394.92s]  Please stop.
[20400.25s -> 20408.40s]  Ayayayayayayayaya.
[20408.40s -> 20408.80s]  I did it.
[20408.80s -> 20409.44s]  Yeah, he said it.
[20412.24s -> 20416.54s]  Ayayayayayayayaya.
[20416.54s -> 20418.75s]  That wasn't even that bad.
[20418.75s -> 20419.71s]  That wasn't even that bad.
[20419.71s -> 20420.83s]  You guys overreacted.
[20421.55s -> 20423.07s]  Holy shit, you overreacted.
[20424.56s -> 20426.08s]  Wow what an overreaction to that.
[20426.08s -> 20426.80s]  I can't believe it.
[20426.80s -> 20428.80s]  I- you what an overreacted.
[20428.80s -> 20429.44s]  Okay.
[20438.12s -> 20439.64s]  What's that music?
[20439.64s -> 20446.67s]  Hey sad.
[20447.71s -> 20448.27s]  Vega.
[20448.27s -> 20449.63s]  Thanks for the 250.
[20449.63s -> 20453.26s]  So when can we expect the 10 Ghost Peppers to be eaten on stream?
[20453.26s -> 20462.54s]  or the 50,000 USD excluding tax subs i think i mean if you all right you want to go there
