[1.66s -> 16.36s]  Hello. How are you doing? It's good to hear. I'm doing pretty good too. Just hanging out. Loving
[16.36s -> 28.60s]  up PS4. Gonna do something I've wanted to do for a while, and that's play Days Gone. I know the
[28.60s -> 37.03s]  reviews aren't that great. It's not a 10 out of 10 experience, but we're gonna just throw a whole
[37.03s -> 49.16s]  day away. Pretty good title, I think. But hope you're doing good. We're gonna get started.
[49.16s -> 59.02s]  I'll give you the rundown for this week. Yes, we are very early today. That's because we're
[59.02s -> 67.67s]  gonna be very early tomorrow too. Back-to-back days starting somewhere before one or two o'clock.
[73.05s -> 85.34s]  EU stream. Stop being so early. I can't help it. Sometimes I have to. But yeah, so what's
[85.34s -> 92.94s]  gonna happen here is I wanted to play Days Gone. It's a new game. It's got motorcycles
[93.02s -> 98.97s]  in it, so that's an automatic plus one ladder grid. It's open world zombies. This might be
[98.97s -> 108.58s]  terrible. This might be fun. I don't know. This could be the worst game I've ever played.
[108.58s -> 115.42s]  I'm willing to give it a try. So we're gonna go today and tomorrow. If Days Gone is fun,
[116.06s -> 121.59s]  then tomorrow we're gonna keep going. If Days Gone, we actually just wasted a whole day.
[123.16s -> 128.90s]  Then I won't play it tomorrow, and we'll do something else tomorrow. Then Saturday and Sunday
[128.90s -> 140.18s]  is gonna be Sam and Max Season 2, Episode 3 and 4, and MS-DOS Night 2. Told you I was gonna
[140.18s -> 155.22s]  make that a weekly thing. That is the plan for this week. Porn 2. It sucks, but you may enjoy it.
[155.22s -> 161.94s]  I'm going in with an open mind. I doubt it would be the worst game you've ever played.
[162.81s -> 173.88s]  I don't think it will either. It's very bland. So this is what, like, the tasteless sponge
[173.88s -> 190.58s]  of video games. Isn't this like 50 hours long? It's very playable. Alright. It's a coin flip
[190.58s -> 201.46s]  if it's gonna be enjoyable or not. Okay. Well, let's take that chance. Days Gone.
[203.29s -> 209.69s]  Yeah, like, you ain't getting this one back. I really hope at the end of this stream,
[209.69s -> 216.92s]  I don't say, I wish I could get this day back. But let's go. Days Gone, we're gonna start
[220.90s -> 234.09s]  it. And here it comes. Days Gone. Here comes the opening cut scene. Days Gone, more like eat ass.
[236.23s -> 245.10s]  Yeah, I know, right? Alright. Wait, wait, wait. Why is there no sound? Should there be sound
[245.10s -> 258.81s]  right now? There should be, right? What a waste of a day. I already know. It's a waste.
[258.81s -> 269.10s]  Is this a loading screen? Why do we have, like, the Witcher 2 base game level of loading
[269.10s -> 278.97s]  screen? No, this is, like, the original Witcher. Do you guys remember that shit?
[278.97s -> 294.71s]  What is going on right now? It can't be this long. This is, that's the initial load time,
[294.71s -> 315.48s]  right? I got, I have nothing, I have nothing to say. I have nothing to say. I don't have anything.
[315.48s -> 326.17s]  It's just a long loading screen. That's it. That's all. I don't have anything else to say.
[326.17s -> 333.27s]  This better be good. No, I already put a warning in the title. You've been pre-warned.
[337.72s -> 347.91s]  This is kind of, uh, is unbelievable though. I have class soon. You may as well just go,
[347.91s -> 351.19s]  you know what? If you got class soon, you may as well just go study, like,
[351.27s -> 360.34s]  extra study time. I can't hear anything. All right, brightness. This doesn't need to be
[360.34s -> 367.26s]  brightened. Set your brightness so that days gone is barely visible. Now, I always hate that
[367.26s -> 373.32s]  shit. It's never correct. I'm gonna go with, like, seven. I'm gonna turn HDR on or off.
[373.88s -> 389.34s]  Can I not turn it on? I can't even turn it on. I cannot hear anything. Is it because
[389.34s -> 399.45s]  this is too low? Playing on seven brightness. What do you mean? I need to be able to see.
[402.89s -> 406.97s]  Nobody plays these games at, like, two brightness. You can't see anything.
[406.97s -> 418.34s]  Is it possible to play? All right, let me turn this up on my end because this is, like, this is
[419.38s -> 425.90s]  bait. You know what I mean? This is bait. Okay, now I can hear it. Press any button.
[427.29s -> 436.81s]  Days gone. Welcome. Here's the options menu. Controls. Display. Oh, all right. I'm staying
[436.81s -> 444.28s]  at seven brightness. Audio. I mean, I don't know. Who cares? Dialogue. Sound effects.
[444.28s -> 449.42s]  They'll just keep everything normal. I don't like the music being the same. Gameplay.
[449.42s -> 455.50s]  Difficulty. Put it on. Just keep it on. Wait, there is no hard. Guys, there's no hard,
[455.50s -> 465.61s]  so you can't make fun of me this time. You can't make fun of me. Normal is hard.
[467.22s -> 475.22s]  Vibration off. This ain't 1995. We're just gonna keep it like that. What else is there?
[475.22s -> 483.54s]  User interface. XP indicators are off. Well, we're gonna get an entire huge tutorial.
[483.54s -> 491.77s]  We're gonna get, like, a four to five hour tutorial. This is my last chance here. This is
[491.77s -> 510.71s]  it. This is my final chance to, like, do something else. I've done to skip. No, I'm, I locked it in.
[510.71s -> 518.52s]  Hope that wasn't a mistake. It's a good game. I know. Why am I, like, sitting here going,
[518.52s -> 526.60s]  like, oh, no, this is my last chance. This is it. After this, it's a video game.
[526.60s -> 544.95s]  Relax. This is not my audition for American Idol. I'm gonna be okay. Like, it's a game.
[544.95s -> 547.51s]  We're just gonna enjoy it. Now, this is my one shot.
[559.11s -> 559.35s]  Knife.
[565.83s -> 566.79s]  That's, yeah, what did he say?
[571.99s -> 572.87s]  We need subtitles.
[582.68s -> 584.36s]  Hold on, I can't do this yet. Wait.
[585.00s -> 590.52s]  Wait, we need help. She's been wounded. What? What's wrong with her? Well, she's not.
[590.52s -> 592.84s]  Whatever the hell's going on out there, she's been stabbed.
[595.16s -> 598.06s]  Come on, man. You're an astronaut. You should know what to do.
[598.62s -> 602.54s]  If we don't get her to a hospital, she's going to die. There are no more hospitals.
[603.18s -> 608.47s]  Hospitals. You got, uh, doctors. You got tri-i's. You got a mass unit.
[608.47s -> 611.19s]  Oh, look, I'm just a grad student, okay? I, I got volunteered to do this.
[611.19s -> 619.86s]  Just an astronaut. That's the, that's the party store astronaut costume.
[640.20s -> 643.08s]  That's the guy that comes to the party in the astronaut costume that was like
[643.08s -> 648.20s]  $14 at the party store. He's smoking a joint and he like takes the helmet off and he's like,
[648.20s -> 650.76s]  Oh, I'm ready to hit the moon. All right. I'm going to play.
[687.34s -> 692.74s]  Chopper's coming down. Big ring.
[693.54s -> 698.36s]  This man coming.
[710.36s -> 715.34s]  25 captain crunch box top to get this. Make sure you bring it back in one piece.
[732.46s -> 736.86s]  Okay. Let me put the subtitles on.
[748.04s -> 773.80s]  It was plenty of space in the helicopter. Hello? Anytime a game spends this, I think the
[773.80s -> 784.54s]  game's hung up. Like it's hanging. It's pretty much what I was going for in dreams the other
[784.54s -> 791.88s]  day. Did they did a kind of a better job than I did, but you know, he can't be perfect.
[797.03s -> 804.38s]  Freaker is all dead. Zombies are called Freakers. Sounds like he's YouTube sub
[805.26s -> 817.32s]  community. Uh, plus one letter grade.
[817.40s -> 819.48s]  Can't be far. Wait, hold on. Cut your engine.
[820.84s -> 832.28s]  Shit, she's alive. Alvarez. Alvarez. Hey, Alvarez. What happened here? I mean,
[833.00s -> 841.90s]  who did this? Was it, was it Rippers? No, his community is really nice. It wasn't
[841.90s -> 868.02s]  Rip Van Winkle 22. It was Freaker. Freaker HD 1080p. Here we go. Gameplay.
[870.04s -> 875.72s]  Chase down Leon. How do I, how do I drive? They didn't tell me how to drive. X to
[875.72s -> 887.45s]  boost. It's actually kind of hard to drive this. How many boosts do I get? Oh,
[887.45s -> 901.32s]  it's the rumors versus the zoomers. Just drive through the fire. It doesn't even matter.
[901.32s -> 920.46s]  Look, I'm going too slow. Subtitles, subtitles, subtitles. All right. All right.
[920.46s -> 927.10s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Display. Why can I not turn this on? Why would you have
[927.10s -> 939.75s]  this setting here? This is probably PS4 Pro only. Language. Subtitles. There,
[939.75s -> 958.76s]  I turned them on. Derma, come to Brazil.
[976.09s -> 985.24s]  65 mile per hour on this road. He lays his bike down. When landing, you can
[985.24s -> 988.44s]  reduce bike damage by using L to angle your tires parallel to the ground. Give me the
[988.44s -> 992.12s]  next tip. If you drift while turning, you can slide through corners and even do donuts.
[992.12s -> 1005.22s]  Give the next one while on the bike. Watch the gas tank right behind you.
[1006.58s -> 1011.37s]  How do you cover somebody with a shotgun from that far away? You may as well just
[1011.37s -> 1032.26s]  shoot it in the air. We'll make it quick. Tracking. Press R3 to activate survival vision,
[1032.26s -> 1035.14s]  which will reveal clues and other information about your surroundings.
[1035.94s -> 1046.46s]  Does every game have to have this? I'm sorry. Like I'm going to have to take a
[1046.46s -> 1053.66s]  second here to explain. What? Why does every fucking AAA game have a spider sense? Why?
[1057.83s -> 1066.42s]  What is causing this guy to have this? Every game is Batman. Yeah, but like why?
[1066.42s -> 1068.74s]  What's like the story purpose for him to be able to see through walls?
[1075.19s -> 1079.82s]  Tracking. While using survival vision, your DualShock 4 wireless controller will vibrate.
[1079.82s -> 1084.89s]  I turned off vibrate. When your camera is facing a clue, depending on your distance to
[1084.89s -> 1087.37s]  it, vibrations will increase or decrease. But I turned them off.
[1095.99s -> 1110.02s]  Okay. Do I seriously have to turn on the vibration? No. What? They're behind us.
[1110.74s -> 1122.09s]  I don't need the vibration. I'll just look. Wait, wait, wait. Here. Down this way. Wait,
[1122.09s -> 1130.55s]  I can see into the past? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I touched the blood. Therefore,
[1130.55s -> 1135.64s]  now I can see the past. Wait, there's a Dark Souls blood stain here. Let me see what
[1135.64s -> 1146.58s]  happened. Watch out. Watch out. He died by something over here. What did he die by?
[1146.74s -> 1151.86s]  I have no idea. He fell and died. I think he was doing the meme where he jumped off
[1151.86s -> 1180.58s]  the top to die and made sure he had the blood. This blips on the map. Can I like investigate?
[1184.18s -> 1191.13s]  How do I take out the gun? No, it doesn't say boomer.
[1191.77s -> 1199.77s]  Balls. He's losing a lot of blood. Press X to hop over parkour style.
[1200.33s -> 1212.28s]  I mean, the environments look pretty cool. Who shot him? Did I shoot him?
[1215.75s -> 1219.83s]  Leading out. That's a hell of a way to go. It's slow. A lot of pain,
[1219.83s -> 1222.63s]  but I suppose you know him about that. She was still breathing when we found her,
[1222.63s -> 1225.35s]  you piece of shit. I wasn't going to waste a bullet not on her.
[1225.99s -> 1229.50s]  I don't know for a second. I don't know for a second now. Where's the stash?
[1231.26s -> 1244.50s]  Boss, don't look like you've been sleeping for too long. Leon, he got a little problem.
[1244.50s -> 1250.70s]  Why would you do that? I can smell your blood. Now they'll smell me because I'm stupid enough
[1250.70s -> 1264.60s]  to put my hands on it. No, wait. All right. All right. I got it right here. Take it.
[1265.56s -> 1267.08s]  He smears blood all over it with his hands.
[1274.55s -> 1280.97s]  Is he a bad guy? We're the bad guy in this story.
[1286.14s -> 1296.97s]  Do it. Do it. Do it. Fulfill your destiny.
[1297.93s -> 1307.45s]  Holy fall. Oh my God, he actually did it. Welcome to the dark side. Hey, uh.
[1308.65s -> 1310.89s]  Tuck's going to need something for the bounty.
[1325.42s -> 1335.40s]  I didn't even have time to make him a mask. Oh, no. Oh, God. I'm not putting the pressure.
[1335.40s -> 1340.12s]  I had six months to come up with Darth Vader. You are, uh,
[1340.92s -> 1344.22s]  Hey, hold up. I want to search this camp. See if I can't find something.
[1349.51s -> 1365.10s]  That's terrible. Make something out of this. Oh, scraps. Fine materials to craft. Crafting.
[1369.53s -> 1373.69s]  What? Are you telling me that there's a whole entire fucking crafting system?
[1374.57s -> 1392.31s]  Let me use my boomer vision. Come on. I can't like fail to pick stuff up off the ground
[1392.31s -> 1420.10s]  tutorial. We'll make it quick. Um, will you? Are you sure? Where? I seriously need to turn
[1420.10s -> 1427.70s]  on vibrations, don't I? God damn it. I hate vibrations. It makes me feel like ill.
[1428.42s -> 1450.07s]  I didn't even help. Um, are you like, are you my dog? Are you pointing in the right
[1450.07s -> 1459.93s]  direction here? It vibrates like you're on a hog. There's a dead guy in there.
[1460.65s -> 1487.98s]  Sleeping bag? No, it's not the sleeping bag. All right. Where is this?
[1488.78s -> 1509.53s]  Uh, so I'm serious. Where the fuck is this? That shit? What? There wasn't even an indicator.
[1510.33s -> 1519.70s]  All right. Why was there an indicator for the first one and no indicator for the second one?
[1519.70s -> 1527.42s]  There was no square on the screen. All right. He's R to expand the medical category.
[1528.06s -> 1538.44s]  Hold R1 to craft a bandage. How many can I make? He's gone. No, that didn't. What?
[1541.00s -> 1547.69s]  All right. Let's use the bandage. So you can go on the wheel. Just hold R2.
[1548.25s -> 1556.42s]  Okay, it's got a fucking wheel. We're really ticking all the AAA video game boxes, aren't we?
[1571.96s -> 1575.48s]  Sprinting and rolling depletes your stamina. If you run out, you need to wait for it to
[1575.48s -> 1578.60s]  recover. At first I thought that said you need to drink water. I was about to say no,
[1578.60s -> 1592.15s]  don't make me do that. Died to loot wheel.
[1601.37s -> 1607.66s]  Son of a bitch. Step back, step back. Just piss yourself. Fuel pump. Yeah,
[1607.66s -> 1611.34s]  shot out my damn fuel pump. Can we get anything out of Leon? Get away from that.
[1611.34s -> 1616.55s]  It's done. Let's just go back to O'Leary Mountain. All it takes is a guy with a
[1616.55s -> 1636.34s]  cigar in his mouth and you're done. Fight this? Far from here. Let's just head over there.
[1636.90s -> 1639.62s]  What are you thinking? We were going out hunting tonight anyway.
[1640.50s -> 1644.33s]  What's it really like? It's as good a place as any.
[1646.01s -> 1657.32s]  Okay. Oh, we're doing. Oh, we're doing bunk beds. Nice. Hey, what did Leon give you?
[1657.96s -> 1664.01s]  Map of some kind. Once we get my bike back, let's head up to the cemetery. Look around.
[1664.97s -> 1675.03s]  Yeah, I have no control. I just have to hold on. So tomorrow get the drugs, take him to Tucker,
[1675.03s -> 1680.71s]  collect on Leon's bounty. Then I say we head north. Do you think shit's any different?
[1680.71s -> 1686.22s]  I say we head south. So we have a little bit. That just scared the fuck out of me.
[1686.78s -> 1690.30s]  What the fuck would you do? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1692.15s -> 1695.91s]  Why did this just come up? What's going on? Hold on. You went too fast here.
[1696.55s -> 1705.19s]  Swipe left. Did I press that? I mean, maybe I pressed it. Swipe left. Can I go back?
[1705.99s -> 1711.10s]  Swipe left or press R1 to view inventory and get info on gear,
[1711.10s -> 1717.98s]  crafting supplies. Okay. Storylines menu. Swipe up or press R1 to view. Swipe up.
[1718.62s -> 1730.78s]  So it's swiping. So we got skills. Okay. Did I level up or something? No, it requires a skill
[1730.78s -> 1750.73s]  point. Jesus Christ. What's happening? This is scaring me. Oh, it's all. Oh, that's what's
[1750.73s -> 1757.05s]  happening. If you touch the, if you touch the pad here on the PS4, it opens the menu.
[1757.93s -> 1765.70s]  Oh, I'm going to scream about this later. I'm going to be in the middle of a fight and I'm
[1765.70s -> 1768.66s]  going to fucking like move my thumb and touch it and it's going to open and I'm going to
[1768.66s -> 1777.85s]  scream. Move the truck with our bare hands? Pushing vehicles. Some vehicles can be moved to
[1777.85s -> 1789.74s]  clear a block pass. Hold. Swear to push them. Put tape on your controller. I thought someone
[1789.74s -> 1805.34s]  was driving. I don't know how this happened. I got stuck in the snow. Hey. What? Oh,
[1809.27s -> 1813.27s]  he wanted to punch him. He wanted to punch that guy. He didn't, he wasn't even aiming for me.
[1816.55s -> 1824.73s]  What? Why? Why? Hold L in any enemy's direction and press R2.
[1827.78s -> 1829.78s]  Choose direction and then tap R1 to roll.
[1830.42s -> 1861.88s]  I just slit everybody's throats. Oh, okay. Anybody have any loot on them? Wow. Jake,
[1861.88s -> 1867.02s]  you're a real psycho. I don't know what it is, man. I have to slit their throats.
[1872.25s -> 1880.18s]  No loot? Yeah, what's up with that? Coming up on the old Nero checkpoint.
[1883.94s -> 1890.15s]  Dude, the best trope in all of media is definitely you punched a guy in the face you
[1890.15s -> 1894.71s]  weren't supposed to punch in the face. Imagine like you punched your friend directly in his face
[1894.71s -> 1899.03s]  as hard as you could because somebody ducked slowly.
[1909.38s -> 1913.22s]  That would cause, that would be ripple effects for what that happened there
[1913.86s -> 1918.42s]  for 10 years. You would never trust each other. There'd be a falling out
[1918.42s -> 1922.02s]  months and weeks later. It would never, it would change your friendship forever.
[1927.86s -> 1931.99s]  Yeah. Okay, go through the tunnel.
[1942.23s -> 1948.98s]  Can we siphon some of the gas from these cars? That would be a real survival game.
[1949.86s -> 1955.11s]  No, we just walked 10 feet for another cutscene. Why not just have the cutscene go through here?
[1965.22s -> 1973.59s]  Clip this. Somebody show the clip. Do it. I know somebody has that one. Do it. No,
[1973.59s -> 1977.35s]  not the slap. I'm talking about the puke. Why? Why would you do this?
[1980.15s -> 2006.79s]  Two fucking enemies. What is this game? Can I play? I got to shoot twice.
[2008.95s -> 2012.87s]  They could have done all this in one cutscene and then like just teach me how to shoot
[2012.95s -> 2023.27s]  in two minutes. Oh, you're never going to get this day back. You're never getting these days back,
[2023.27s -> 2034.46s]  Jeremy. These guys are on the map. I'm being too harsh. They need to like teach people how to
[2034.46s -> 2047.96s]  play. Do I have to get on his bike? I can't like, there's no more enemies or anything. I'd
[2047.96s -> 2054.86s]  have to get on the bike. He's just following me. Okay, if there's another cutscene here,
[2055.80s -> 2059.08s]  I'm going to be very, very, no, wait, are you actually just following me on the bike?
[2062.09s -> 2086.14s]  I can't get on the bike. Oh god. Why don't we just ride through? Oh, there is loot. Oh shit,
[2086.14s -> 2088.94s]  we can turn this off. I've played Left 4 Dead before. Can we steal something from her?
[2089.50s -> 2104.18s]  You know anything about cars? Plus one scrap. Oh no, you unplugged the car from the outlet.
[2104.74s -> 2107.99s]  How many bolts do I have?
[2108.81s -> 2113.05s]  You're not getting your bike through there. Try that service tunnel. See if you can clear us a
[2113.05s -> 2117.13s]  path from the other side. I got it. Just keep your headlight pointed that way.
[2118.81s -> 2122.25s]  Keep your head, please keep your headlight pointed at the objective because I,
[2122.25s -> 2127.34s]  I would have missed it and I actually would have. I went too far up. Wait,
[2127.34s -> 2134.84s]  hold on. This game probably has like secrets. I shouldn't just be running through as fast
[2134.84s -> 2147.86s]  as I can. Whoa, scary. Am I gonna have a fist fight with a zombie? Oh, that would have been
[2147.86s -> 2153.37s]  so fucking funny. You redeem this entire first like 30-40 minutes of the game if me and that
[2153.37s -> 2158.26s]  zombie have a fist fight. He like punches me in the face like three or four times because
[2158.26s -> 2166.92s]  he hands up like a boxer. Where's the flashlight coming from? Um, I think my eyes.
[2167.64s -> 2183.34s]  Where's the flashlight coming from? No, it's just a spotlight. Oh fuck, I was talking a
[2183.34s -> 2188.42s]  lot of shit. He does have superpowers. I'm sorry. I retract everything I said. Never mind.
[2197.18s -> 2211.26s]  Every biker has, has what? Light eyes? Oops. Come on, get in here quick. We're gonna get
[2211.26s -> 2238.98s]  out of here. Let's go. No, let me shoot him. Shoot. Shoot him. He doesn't give a shit. He
[2239.06s -> 2248.33s]  doesn't care if I live or die. He was pretending to help. That backwards side gun hold was just
[2248.33s -> 2256.28s]  like, ah, whatever. I'll find another friend. There's a double. Is there a zoom in feature?
[2260.50s -> 2265.66s]  They're blocking the bullets? He wasn't actually trying to block the bullets,
[2265.66s -> 2275.74s]  was he? His hands? I don't have any bullets left. Did I fail this tutorial?
[2276.38s -> 2292.68s]  Another nest. Knife. Yeah, that's right. I have a knife. How many molotovs you got left?
[2292.68s -> 2297.69s]  Oh, we're gonna teach men to throw molotovs. Just use the last one. You got any shit to make
[2297.69s -> 2316.65s]  more? Burn the freaker nest. Okay, well, give them to me. You got any shit to make more.
[2316.65s -> 2326.14s]  This will just take a sec. All right, throwables category. There's rocks. Okay, so, I mean,
[2327.24s -> 2335.34s]  there are rocks. With the molotov equipped, hold L2 and aim, tap R2 to throw. All right,
[2335.34s -> 2343.75s]  there's the nest right there. I don't have any bullets. I don't have any bullets.
[2345.48s -> 2367.75s]  No, I want to like, what are they doing? Oh, he got him. It's like more fun to dodge
[2367.75s -> 2378.04s]  around than it is to do anything else. Round one of zombies. All right, get us out of here.
[2387.66s -> 2389.90s]  Yeah, I'm collecting their ears for some crazy reason.
[2397.56s -> 2403.00s]  25. From 65 to 25. Sounds about right.
[2410.22s -> 2420.01s]  Got any more molotovs? Oh, I have an idea. Hey, you just scream as loud as you can over
[2420.01s -> 2423.82s]  here off the bike and wait till they all run over to you and then I'll leave.
[2440.98s -> 2442.34s]  Wow.
[2446.82s -> 2450.34s]  That's actually what we're doing. That's the real plan.
[2456.26s -> 2462.98s]  All right. He didn't leave the bike though. He's gonna pull them and I have to get to the
[2462.98s -> 2471.26s]  garage. I would laugh if he just crashed and flew up. I don't have any bullets though.
[2471.26s -> 2476.14s]  I'm gonna have to really play tactically. You got a death wish. Find crazy Willy's garage.
[2485.19s -> 2489.91s]  Newts. Newts are skittish and usually stick to out of reach places like rooftops. They will
[2489.91s -> 2492.79s]  attack if they sense you are low on health or if you invade their turf.
[2505.22s -> 2532.65s]  Oh, I'm invading their turf. Get away from me! What? What? They're like zombies. They're
[2532.65s -> 2543.74s]  like aliens. All right, hold on. So what on the screen here is... I didn't even hurt anybody.
[2544.30s -> 2555.66s]  All right, so we have to get into the garage. Bushes. Provide cover for stealth if you haven't
[2555.66s -> 2559.26s]  been spotted. Remain crouched with circle to stay hidden and use rocks to create distractions.
[2582.50s -> 2589.06s]  I didn't even need to use the... He didn't see me. I technically did it in stealth.
[2591.40s -> 2613.50s]  Oh, shit! All right, you got a guy right there. I'm gonna actually do the rest in
[2613.50s -> 2621.93s]  stealth. I'm gonna play this like a true video game. Watch this. Ready? Well, it takes the
[2621.93s -> 2659.03s]  gun out immediately. I just want rocks. Did you see me? Can you see me? This is actually fun.
[2659.03s -> 2676.20s]  This is a fun game. No ammo. What? Oh, you have... I gotta stop fucking around.
[2676.20s -> 2699.08s]  There's ammo in the game. Nice dodge. Holy shit. Okay, so there's a guy in here. Wait.
[2699.64s -> 2707.27s]  All right, no more fucking around. Let's actually do this correctly.
[2715.96s -> 2723.85s]  Would the buddy go? Yeah, that's true. Where is he? He was riding around out here.
[2738.71s -> 2749.94s]  Gas can? Gas cans can be used to refuel your bike and generator. Is it...
[2750.58s -> 2767.62s]  Wait, I can throw? Can I just pour it out? Holy shit! Drink the gas. Spark plug?
[2770.49s -> 2773.85s]  Silence your guns by attaching a suppressor. Select a compatible gun of the survival
[2773.85s -> 2781.30s]  weapon. Press R1 to attach it. Did I get a suppressor from the car? That's a little odd.
[2782.02s -> 2804.63s]  It was R1, right? R1? R1. Is that not... Am I not doing this right? Yeah, R1. R1. I don't
[2804.63s -> 2828.57s]  know. I'm gonna blow that up. You know I'm gonna. Oh! Yes! I need to try. No, no. I want to hit...
[2828.57s -> 2843.85s]  I want to swing at it. I got a sick... a stick. Wait, hold on. I want to look around. What's in
[2843.85s -> 2853.00s]  here? A spark plug? Maybe I don't have enough materials. All right, there's something over here.
[2856.78s -> 2859.74s]  Explosive objects will blow up and damage by bullets or other explosives.
[2860.30s -> 2867.54s]  So I can't, like, do anything with this. This... No, that's gonna explode. This is an
[2867.54s -> 2871.54s]  explosive. I'm holding an explosive. If I throw an explosive at an explosive, it's at explosives.
[2872.10s -> 2879.45s]  So I'm not gonna do that. All right, let's just get in here. What do you mean? Yes, you can.
[2882.98s -> 2896.04s]  Not real. Okay, see? It's plastic versus metal. It's not explosive. It's what's inside that
[2896.04s -> 2914.70s]  matters. Break it with a knife. Okay, we gotta get in there somehow. Up on the roof.
[2914.70s -> 2930.14s]  Let's use our boomer vision. Shoot it. I don't have any bullets. I'm out of bullets. Baseball
[2930.14s -> 2947.27s]  bat. Damage and durability. Oh, I want the bat. I love baseball bats. Can I throw stuff?
[2947.27s -> 2970.79s]  Can I throw the bat? Imagine if it went through the can and exploded. All right,
[2970.79s -> 2977.37s]  we got any more freakers? I don't think so. I need to bring this with me, though.
[2977.93s -> 2992.18s]  I might need it. I don't see any more freakers. No more trunks. This is just open.
[2992.98s -> 3002.33s]  Oh, another gas. No, I don't want that. Battery, though. Battery. Take the battery.
[3012.04s -> 3023.75s]  I'm not gonna drink the gas. It'll be a sidearm suppressor. It'll give you energy. I don't think
[3023.75s -> 3037.62s]  I... Why am I carrying? Do I need to take this somewhere? Can I have... Can I hold two? No.
[3037.62s -> 3046.50s]  Which one has more in it? I'll take this one. Well, there's just a bunch of shit in here.
[3048.87s -> 3059.34s]  Rag. Drink the bat. No, I gotta do something cool with this. I'm not drinking the gasoline.
[3059.34s -> 3064.92s]  I'm gonna blow the gasoline. I wish I could just dump the gasoline. All right, that's fine.
[3064.92s -> 3070.79s]  Let's just get out of here and head into the back way of the garage. Here we go.
[3073.88s -> 3083.62s]  Board it up. Well, oh, never mind. We're going this way. I can't jump. Is there a way to go all the
[3083.62s -> 3102.22s]  way around? Like, up there? I can't go... Wait. Am I maybe, like... Can I jump on these? Well,
[3102.22s -> 3106.86s]  I have to go across there. So how do I get up there? Is it the tree? Do I have to jump from
[3106.86s -> 3144.14s]  the tree? I don't see a ladder. You'd think there would be a ladder out here. I don't see
[3144.22s -> 3162.70s]  a ladder. Well, do I push the car over here? Can I, like, shove the car over?
[3168.34s -> 3176.38s]  Can I just go into edit mode? Well, it looks like I'm going over here. Can I, like... No,
[3176.38s -> 3208.22s]  don't go in the dumpster. I want to, like, climb the dumpster. Well, okay. Can I go up?
[3208.22s -> 3233.90s]  Compelling climb to trash gameplay. Do I just need to shoot the lock? No, I don't. Look,
[3233.90s -> 3241.00s]  they're making me go, like, all the way. Do I have to shoot the lock? No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3241.00s -> 3255.77s]  They wouldn't do that. They wouldn't make me do that. I don't have any bullets. I need a
[3255.77s -> 3268.07s]  different gun. I have no bullets. I can't even, like, attempt to do that. Pour gas on the lock.
[3270.74s -> 3286.63s]  All right. Well, I'm... Let's try, I guess, go to the left and climb up. But from where?
[3288.63s -> 3310.94s]  Like, over here? There's, like, nothing over here. Is it up this? Do I actually have to just jump on
[3310.94s -> 3340.41s]  this thing? All right. I didn't... That was... I had to do that. They were coming after me.
[3340.41s -> 3350.98s]  All right, so let me get in here now. Is there, like, a hatch I can pull? Can I, like, move,
[3350.98s -> 3369.78s]  break something, move something? I mean, all right, yeah. So, I'm sorry I didn't know
[3369.78s -> 3377.88s]  that. I'm looking for a ladder. This one, like, little gray shed that's sitting on the side.
[3378.60s -> 3398.65s]  That's the only place you can get up. All right, let's get some cash out of the ATM,
[3398.65s -> 3410.01s]  I think. Fucking money's worthless. Don't worry. I still got plenty of gold. All right,
[3410.01s -> 3416.66s]  what else is in here? Nothing. Nothing. Let's unlock the... First of all, let's get the
[3416.66s -> 3433.24s]  shortcut open. That's important. Anything in the toilets? No. Yes, there is. Elevator next
[3433.24s -> 3449.29s]  to Firelink. No, what? Find the fuel pump. Was it in this room right here?
[3460.10s -> 3468.28s]  No, I found the fuel pump. Dude, how long have you been in there for?
[3469.32s -> 3480.58s]  There's 400 chasing me. I'm out of gas. You've been in there for an hour and a half, man.
[3484.04s -> 3488.04s]  Hey, Boozman, I'm sorry. There was one shed that I had to climb up and I couldn't figure
[3488.12s -> 3504.23s]  it out. I needed a bunch of friends to help me find it. What are you fucking stupid? A couple
[3504.23s -> 3512.17s]  thousand friends. Wait, what did I just do? Max. All right, I have too many of these. I gotta
[3512.17s -> 3529.70s]  craft some stuff. Hold on. Can I craft ammo? It's refined metal. All right, let's go find
[3529.70s -> 3546.23s]  Boomer. Hold on. Hang on, Boozman. I'm coming. What was my gas tank? Oh, he's up there.
[3546.95s -> 3554.07s]  He's just doing donuts up there. Is he really just like spinning around in circles?
[3558.71s -> 3566.20s]  You took way too long. Blind. Streamers blind. He did this to me.
[3588.84s -> 3602.36s]  What the hell? How? Get low. Get low. Is that a song?
[3603.32s -> 3612.23s]  I've been singing a song. You can enter cover by crouching next to it. Press circle to toggle
[3612.23s -> 3620.74s]  crouch. So those are rippers. Shoulder swapping. While aiming L2, press X to shoulder swap.
[3637.30s -> 3656.25s]  Let me make a couple things here. Let me just start crafting.
[3656.25s -> 3659.51s]  Sons of bitches, get off of them!
[3664.71s -> 3667.91s]  I was trying to hit him in the head with a rock. That may have been a mistake.
[3681.83s -> 3695.16s]  I was trying to throw a rock at my friend's head.
[3695.16s -> 3710.90s]  What's with the crowd?
[3723.38s -> 3723.94s]  It's us.
[3727.06s -> 3731.06s]  Yeah, there they are. I needed like three or four thousand of them to figure out what to do.
[3736.52s -> 3740.92s]  Streamer sucks, game sucks. Idiot blind. That's what they're all screaming.
[3752.10s -> 3771.18s]  He can't possibly be this bad. Next. He can't reach it. He's not pretending.
[3774.70s -> 3788.28s]  Hey dude, you all right? You okay? All right, here we go. Welcome to the game.
[3789.08s -> 3802.33s]  Don't you wait out here. Make sure it's all clear. Screw that. There's a bunk calling my name.
[3804.46s -> 3814.30s]  This guy's all fucked up. Like there's much to steal. I'm just gonna reintroduce myself.
[3817.03s -> 3823.40s]  This is ride to hell retribution with zombies in place of the so bad it's good factor.
[3827.59s -> 3832.07s]  I mean, I can't make that assessment yet.
[3832.87s -> 3842.94s]  Oh, it's still light up. Hey, I've got some ammo if you need it in the footlocker by the door.
[3842.94s -> 3850.04s]  Thanks. Can we just dump hydrogen peroxide all over you? You're making me itch.
[3857.34s -> 3861.02s]  Thanks brother. Just feel kind of naked without it.
[3870.06s -> 3874.70s]  All right, so director is on the mountain. Six percent he's my brother.
[3874.70s -> 3880.55s]  I'm six percent of the way through the story. New items.
[3881.69s -> 3890.15s]  Primary. Sidearms. Special. Primary. Nothing. Sidearms. Nine millimeter with the can on it.
[3890.87s -> 3900.12s]  Okay. Crossbow. Good in stealth situations. Its versatility goes up. The more bolts you can
[3900.12s -> 3916.28s]  craft, the crossbow has a longer reload time. All right, let's put it on. Drifters on the
[3916.28s -> 3920.36s]  mountain. Return to your bike. Hold on. So this is where I store my weapons and items and
[3920.36s -> 3939.90s]  stuff. What else is in here? A bunch of ammo. Why do I even have the shot? I want to like
[3939.90s -> 3943.34s]  reload that. It's one of those things where I have to walk out and then reload.
[3945.16s -> 3956.46s]  No, it's locked. See, there we go. Okay, now reload the damn gun. Reload them all.
[3957.02s -> 3966.78s]  And now take the ammo because I can take more ammo, right? Or no. Well, whatever.
[3966.78s -> 3968.94s]  I thought I was going to be able to load the gun and take more ammo.
[3970.97s -> 3975.14s]  Pick this one. Now what's this?
[3978.81s -> 3983.14s]  Maneuver quickly through the safe house gate to avoid letting enemies in.
[3983.14s -> 3989.08s]  People can just come in. Heal. Oh, you actually, okay. Thankfully you can just press this
[3989.08s -> 3996.02s]  button. So that's fully heal. Anything else in here I need to do or can see?
[3996.82s -> 4009.85s]  It's just ammo, all right. Crafting bench or something. That's a bat. I'll take it. All
[4009.85s -> 4025.93s]  right. Well, let's go. I can't just drive my bike. I can't drive his bike to my bike and somebody
[4025.93s -> 4032.78s]  will get it. You can now create a new crossbow boat by crafting them. Cedar saplings provide
[4032.78s -> 4037.74s]  the wood and scrap makes the tip. Combine the two in the survival wheel. All right, so I need
[4038.46s -> 4051.96s]  saplings and scrap to make bolts. Makes sense. I can't even
[4053.37s -> 4077.00s]  do that. Follow mission. Crossbow bolts are affected by gravity and will drop as they
[4077.00s -> 4084.65s]  travel to the target. When shooting at something far away, aim higher. I gotta follow this guy.
[4089.42s -> 4094.84s]  We just have to run behind him. All right, he's in the base. He made it to like the
[4094.84s -> 4104.10s]  fallout base. Clear the Marauder camp. You got it. Target the binoculars with up and press
[4104.10s -> 4108.12s]  R2 to mark. Marking enemies makes it easier to follow their movements.
[4108.12s -> 4119.22s]  Tracked human enemies will display their awareness levels. All right, let's just do it.
[4119.86s -> 4129.98s]  How do I zoom in? L3 is zoom. Well, L3 is zoom. Okay, I'm walking towards them with
[4129.98s -> 4140.07s]  binoculars. I saw L3. Technically, this is zooming in. It's just walking forward.
[4140.07s -> 4183.02s]  Where are the others? That guy's alive? All right, where's the rest of them?
[4195.80s -> 4206.17s]  I think I saw something. Yeah, well, you may have. Stool leg? No, my, the weapon I had was
[4206.17s -> 4227.99s]  better. Pistol ammo. Do they have an indicator over here? Wait, is some?
[4227.99s -> 4281.90s]  That's a bird. Speaking of a head. Well, neither are you.
[4283.16s -> 4286.44s]  Regaining stealth. If you've been spotted by an enemy, get out of their line of sight
[4286.44s -> 4305.69s]  and hide. They'll eventually give up the search. Really. I'm trying to backstab her.
[4314.86s -> 4316.22s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me check around.
[4319.82s -> 4322.78s]  She was walking up backwards.
[4327.66s -> 4329.02s]  Nothing else.
[4341.59s -> 4347.48s]  Free shit. It's fucked up that you're killing their entire family for no reason.
[4349.10s -> 4361.91s]  Well, it's not for no reason. It's to survive. I missed a rifle. Wait, there's a rifle? Am I
[4361.91s -> 4375.56s]  getting baited? I don't know if I believe that. Bad weather can affect enemy's ability
[4375.56s -> 4378.36s]  to see and hear. It can also affect the conditions of trails and roads. All right,
[4379.24s -> 4383.83s]  damn freakers. Swimmers are sensitive to light, feeding mostly at night or during heavy storms.
[4383.83s -> 4405.26s]  Taking on more than one is death or something. It's not worth it. Will they have anything
[4405.26s -> 4435.77s]  good? I might be able to get a stealth hold on. Got him! There's only one more.
[4450.15s -> 4464.95s]  He's telling me to run. Why would I run? There's only one.
[4477.34s -> 4480.46s]  It's raining all the time. All the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain.
[4481.58s -> 4492.28s]  Oh shit. Somebody's right here. Oh fuck, there is somebody right there. What about the rock?
[4492.28s -> 4503.06s]  Go to the rock first. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What the hell just happened? That was
[4503.06s -> 4511.93s]  weird. Does he know I'm here? What is he doing? Oh my god, he's doing the golem. This
[4511.93s -> 4536.58s]  is bad. I think I have to... durability meter, melee weapons found on the field, break easily.
[4536.58s -> 4541.08s]  Pay attention to the durability meter. If there's a blinking red icon, there are only a few hits left
[4541.08s -> 4565.80s]  before it breaks. Oh, I still got a knife. Okay, slide. Stay down. Give me my bike back
[4566.44s -> 4573.06s]  so we can continue playing the game. All right, there's still two here. Give me the rock.
[4573.70s -> 4583.37s]  You know, you go that way. Melee stealth kill you?
[4593.93s -> 4604.31s]  Car. Always check the cars. There's a camp right here. Nothing in the boomer vision.
[4605.03s -> 4613.67s]  I need to stop calling it that. Somebody see me? You want to hear me? Rifle over here,
[4613.67s -> 4619.90s]  rifle over here. What's this clip? Why is everybody clipping this? Oh wait, I can't watch
[4619.90s -> 4635.70s]  that. Did I? Who cares about the rifle? Turn around. You and then you. Am I getting
[4635.70s -> 4645.67s]  experience for this? There's exp in this game, right? Wow! He just dodged it.
[4646.47s -> 4660.71s]  No. Melee in this game feels very good. To the point where you could just melee everybody.
[4663.03s -> 4671.58s]  Everyone. You can just melee anyone. Maybe that's just the initial enemy.
[4672.22s -> 4686.10s]  This is it. This is where we left it. All right, so give me my bike and let's move on.
[4686.82s -> 4697.11s]  Somebody stole the bike. I have to keep going. My bike's gone. What a waste of 500 million
[4697.11s -> 4702.07s]  dollars. I don't think it cost that much to make this game. I think it was more like,
[4703.03s -> 4710.44s]  it was probably like 40 million. What?
[4725.46s -> 4733.80s]  You can't shoot him. It was aiming around him. Let's see if I can get one rock throw.
[4742.92s -> 4747.30s]  Why would this guy be over here? There's no reason for this guy to be hiding here.
[4747.30s -> 4751.90s]  Just waiting for me to come know that my bike is stolen. He's standing behind the car.
[4752.86s -> 4776.94s]  That was a huge underhanded throw. Nobody can throw that far underhand. No overhead throws?
[4777.58s -> 4792.46s]  That's kind of ridiculous. It's me! Open up! He's here! He's here! That's right I am.
[4794.57s -> 4810.81s]  Fuck no! I didn't mean to do that. They don't really care. Now he throws it overhand.
[4810.81s -> 4820.71s]  Should I just shoot this guy? Let me like make the- hold on. Let's- can I craft- to
[4820.71s -> 4824.47s]  craft bullets, right? I don't think I can craft anything. Bolt. They don't have enough.
[4825.11s -> 4831.50s]  I need cedar sapling. Well we're just gonna have to shoot people.
[4847.45s -> 4853.11s]  This is- I just- we just go walk in. Yeah that's where I'm headed.
[4853.83s -> 4857.37s]  So it's just a town. Okay. I thought this was a
[4858.17s -> 4862.57s]  bandit camp. I was supposed to go in here and just start shooting people.
[4863.29s -> 4868.07s]  All right here's the kitchen. I'm like trying to plan how to go in
[4868.79s -> 4873.59s]  and kill people. Meeting plans can be collected and turned into encampment
[4873.59s -> 4877.19s]  kitchens for trust and credits. Different types of meat and plants provide different rewards.
[4877.91s -> 4883.19s]  Why does somebody always call me at the worst possible moment? Why do you have to call me?
[4883.19s -> 4895.34s]  Okay. Are there animals in this game? I mean I guess I saw the elk but there's tigers and
[4895.34s -> 4909.35s]  like bears and shit. Okay. Bounties. Freaker ears can be collected and turned into encampment
[4909.35s -> 4914.14s]  bounty clicks for trust and credits. Different freakers have different rewards. All right so
[4914.14s -> 4922.15s]  I can just turn these in for money. Swarmer ear, newt ear. I guess we can just sell them right?
[4929.38s -> 4930.74s]  Is there any reason to not do that?
[4938.36s -> 4938.76s]  Merchant.
[4955.75s -> 4958.63s]  You ever read it? No. That book doesn't exist man.
[4960.57s -> 4967.05s]  Ran a shop. Farewell. Made all the grease monkeys read it. Being a mechanic requires great peace
[4967.05s -> 4971.85s]  of mind. That's it. If I'm working on an empty stomach, that'll focus your mind. Man,
[4971.85s -> 4982.09s]  I'm looking for a bike. But yeah. Oh, hold on. I want that one. It just came off the truck.
[4982.17s -> 4985.69s]  Some dumb son of a bitch left it out in the shit. Busted up good.
[4985.69s -> 4989.13s]  It was me that did that. Okay. Fooled the road. It didn't be shit about bikes.
[4989.69s -> 4997.14s]  Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Shot the hell out of this one. Partyed it out. It didn't even
[4997.14s -> 5004.02s]  have a fuel pump. We could have used that man. Fuel pump like this one. Okay. Like this one
[5004.02s -> 5012.02s]  man. Okay. Okay. See now when I said fool, what I meant was the fools that brought that
[5012.02s -> 5018.18s]  bike in. See they didn't even tie that shit down properly. So they were like rattling around
[5018.18s -> 5025.99s]  back then. You were right about not getting this day back. It's all right. We're just
[5025.99s -> 5050.94s]  enjoying a new game. All right. What's with the big explosion meter?
[5053.34s -> 5059.90s]  Is this guy flammable? Oh no, I think that that's just the indicator for the quest.
[5059.90s -> 5080.66s]  I thought this guy was flammable. I can't skip the optional dialogue because when I touch
[5081.62s -> 5087.06s]  the, when I touch the thing. Yes, I can. No, I'm not skipping it. Is that people? Come on.
[5109.88s -> 5120.17s]  I'm not bored. I'm not bored yet. I'm not bored.
[5125.70s -> 5132.47s]  Tell you what. You find yourself bored. Bring it to me. Just wait till I get on the car.
[5133.19s -> 5140.42s]  We'll see what we can do for you. I want one of your chapsticks. The bike. You have two of them.
[5140.42s -> 5155.70s]  That your men stole. Salvage. Salvage. Oh wait, nice hat. What? Oh this one. Don't you ever
[5155.70s -> 5164.73s]  touch it. Hold on. Leon wore a hat like this, didn't he? I swear to god. Don't. Do business in
[5164.73s -> 5178.55s]  my camp. Is it weird that I feel like somebody sneezed this story into my head last night?
[5187.77s -> 5192.58s]  That's all I like. The only way I can describe it is there was a storyline that somebody just
[5192.58s -> 5197.94s]  like fucking opened up my head just with a buzz saw pulled back my skull and like took
[5197.94s -> 5203.14s]  and just covered it up and then shook my head and woke me back up. And I was like, oh,
[5203.14s -> 5221.70s]  okay. I think I know. I mean, I'm not really paying too much attention. I mean, I am,
[5221.70s -> 5238.18s]  but I guess there's only so much you can. Can we talk? Can't even talk? Why can I not talk?
[5238.82s -> 5249.69s]  I can't believe there's no talk button. All right, let me go to the, hold on. Before
[5249.69s -> 5257.45s]  I let go anywhere. Where's that merchant? I'll let you buy shit. Yeah, they sell guns,
[5257.45s -> 5262.95s]  ammo, and supplies. If you have enough credits of trust, you can buy shit. So,
[5263.03s -> 5271.77s]  ammo, pistol ammo. How much do I have? 143? Let me buy ammo. Upgrades, presser, health,
[5271.77s -> 5278.84s]  med kit. Oh, grenades. I can't get them though. Locker. Oh, you can go into your locker.
[5278.84s -> 5283.83s]  Okay. All right, look.
[5286.07s -> 5292.30s]  Hold up. I just want to say how sorry I am. I didn't know. I swear. You have any idea
[5292.30s -> 5297.58s]  how much time I put into that bike. It was a drifter bike, Manny. I know. I know.
[5298.54s -> 5305.11s]  I'll make it up. I put together a new one. Oh, this piece of shit, a bike.
[5306.15s -> 5313.11s]  I know it's not. Look, I'll keep an eye out for more parts. I'll hook you up. I swear.
[5313.11s -> 5317.11s]  Okay. What about my custom gas tank, Manny? You know, the one that I got for my dead wife.
[5317.11s -> 5321.75s]  You're going to keep an eye out for that one too? Jesus. I'm sorry. Let's get the fuck out
[5321.75s -> 5333.06s]  of my way. I did it. 100% of the game. Plus a thousand trust gear. There we go. I can't
[5333.06s -> 5337.14s]  wait to be doing that. Me and Boozer can't ride north till I fix up this bike. Get some better
[5337.14s -> 5348.58s]  gear. Give me this bike. Finally. Ride to the Nero checkpoint. Let's go. Let's go.
[5349.70s -> 5377.69s]  It's a bad game. I mean, we can't, we can't, I can't bump into somebody like that.
[5379.11s -> 5381.67s]  Drift. All right. So R2 and then circle.
[5402.66s -> 5403.62s]  Can you fall off the bike?
[5404.26s -> 5413.99s]  Whatever. No third degree burns. You stay there. You rest. Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.
[5413.99s -> 5427.11s]  I'm here. I don't know what way to find out. I guess I made it. I guess, I guess I'll see what
[5427.11s -> 5432.97s]  I can find. This is it. The Nero checkpoint. I got to find some shit for boosers.
[5439.16s -> 5443.32s]  Oh, you can't. All right. Games, not the games. All right.
[5449.48s -> 5465.21s]  Why even fight them? Just run into them. Quick save. T-pad. Do I have the code? I gotta
[5465.21s -> 5471.37s]  find the code. Okay. Uh, restore power to the Nero mobile medical unit.
[5483.66s -> 5489.26s]  No, I was trying to, what? I was trying to, never mind. You know what I was trying to do.
[5505.74s -> 5511.83s]  That's, oh, that's, I told you I was gonna hate it. I told you I was gonna not like
[5511.91s -> 5519.19s]  that mechanic. I was gonna, my thumb was gonna touch it. It won't start. It needs gas.
[5521.11s -> 5538.31s]  I can get gas. I know where gas is. Just find a can. Saving game at the bike. Yes.
[5539.03s -> 5549.26s]  I know about saving the game at the bike. I figured it out. Can. I just need a gas can.
[5552.44s -> 5560.90s]  Dude, I just love scavenging. This gives me flashbacks to when I played The Surge.
[5562.28s -> 5566.36s]  Well, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there for one reason. Because when I played
[5566.36s -> 5574.62s]  The Surge, I was insufferably angry at the game. I hated every second of that game. So, I mean,
[5577.50s -> 5585.99s]  I'm not like angry right now. I'm just kind of bewilderment to try to figure out if I like
[5585.99s -> 5594.65s]  it or not, you know. Bewilderment is the good way to describe this. Give me this stuff.
[5596.54s -> 5610.23s]  Beer bottle rag. Can I make this jump? You don't like it. Just get over it. That's not
[5610.23s -> 5618.01s]  true yet. Hold on. You gotta give me like a... What did I just do that for? Just give me like
[5618.01s -> 5623.54s]  another 30 minutes to tell you about my initial assessment of the game. All right,
[5623.54s -> 5631.96s]  we're gonna get gas. Probably over there. Can I just take it out of the bike?
[5632.60s -> 5645.10s]  Can I put a hose in and just like suck the back of it? Found it. That's as far as you
[5645.10s -> 5650.17s]  can throw. I need 20 hours for my initial thoughts. No, no. I just need like a few.
[5650.81s -> 5665.93s]  We haven't even seen anything yet. All we've seen is... Who's this?
[5666.41s -> 5694.89s]  That's gonna bring them all down on me. But where are they? Right when I get out, really.
[5696.95s -> 5716.54s]  Oh god. I need bandages. Can I stealth by? I probably can. Okay. I gotta like get in there.
[5718.07s -> 5723.48s]  I don't want to go in the front door. Speakers! Where the hell are the speakers?
[5724.20s -> 5730.38s]  I don't feel in danger right now. There's two people. How would they keep their shit?
[5730.38s -> 5733.18s]  If there were like a hundred people chasing me right now, I'd be like, oh no!
[5734.06s -> 5744.39s]  It's two people. Toilet paper and a drill. Neuro injectors can be found inside neuro medical
[5746.15s -> 5749.67s]  units at neuro checkpoints. Use them to permanently increase your health, stamina, or focus.
[5753.03s -> 5761.59s]  How would you inject yourself? Health, stamina, or focused shot skill? I don't know.
[5762.15s -> 5778.22s]  This is a tough decision. Probably stamina. All right, ready? I'm gonna press them all at
[5778.22s -> 5782.58s]  the same time and when everyone happens, happens. Ready? One, two, three! Health.
[5784.25s -> 5805.58s]  There's a bed in here. Why would there be a gun locker here? This is weird. Speakers!
[5810.14s -> 5815.75s]  Why? Speakers!
[5815.75s -> 5851.75s]  All right. I'm trying. Don't even use a weapon. Just swing. Speaker!
[5854.39s -> 5873.77s]  This game really likes to say son of a bitch. You missed. Oh god damn it. Just get out of my
[5873.77s -> 5884.66s]  way. I don't have nitrous. Booster god damn it. Answer me. Booster god damn it. You son of a
[5884.66s -> 5911.19s]  bitch. Come on. That was cool. When landing, you can reduce the damage. Angle your tires
[5911.19s -> 5921.48s]  parallel to the ground. Did I have to freeze the game every time I want to tell you anything?
[5925.75s -> 5928.79s]  You're just tired of listening to your paranoid truth, your bullshit.
[5933.22s -> 5939.11s]  Everything you say is fucking absolute. I thought it was a... I don't know what I...
[5942.71s -> 5954.12s]  I just panicked. I panicked. I didn't really mean... I just panicked. I thought it was like
[5954.12s -> 5959.56s]  an infected zoomer or whatever they are. Sometimes the best strategy is to run away.
[5959.56s -> 5963.88s]  If you have stamina available, press L for you to sprint. Thanks for the tip on my bike
[5963.88s -> 5997.80s]  at the checkpoint here. Thank you. Appreciate it. Come on. Get up there. Get up. Oh fine. Don't
[5997.80s -> 6005.51s]  let me have any fun. I was just gonna start shooting it and blow it up. That was a bad
[6005.51s -> 6016.38s]  idea. He's turning into a freaker as we speak. He's turning into a freaker as we speaker.
[6020.78s -> 6027.11s]  He's dead.
[6037.66s -> 6039.66s]  And then you play him as a playable character now.
[6049.98s -> 6053.78s]  Actually, I do need help. I can't do this.
[6061.14s -> 6067.40s]  Yeah, why would you leave the door wide open? This is Firewatch. It's the same thing in
[6067.40s -> 6071.03s]  Firewatch. Bug the hell out.
[6089.94s -> 6095.90s]  300 nanometers that way. I can't even jump off this either. I can't like jump off that and
[6095.90s -> 6122.71s]  land. No, hold on. Let me... Okay, let's go. I love freedom in environments. No, you go the
[6122.71s -> 6146.09s]  right way. I would call this game in a trend of closed world games. All right, let's go.
[6146.09s -> 6161.48s]  Oh my god. What? I can't believe you hit that thing. I can't believe you hit the dog.
[6178.49s -> 6182.65s]  That's it. All right. I don't know. I want my open world freedom. I'm going this way.
[6193.62s -> 6209.00s]  Something's wrong. Where's my bike? Oh, it does sound... That sound is so... It really
[6209.00s -> 6213.00s]  is like waking up your grandfather instead of I fell off my bike and it crushed me.
[6214.06s -> 6220.22s]  Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa.
[6239.13s -> 6250.66s]  Stop pausing the game. Use scrap to repair your bike. Approach the bike and hold circle
[6250.66s -> 6254.82s]  to begin repairing it. I thought this was a town that I was supposed to go to.
[6257.78s -> 6303.53s]  All right, sounds good. Oh my god, I'm dead. Get off the bike. Okay, so I have $200 if
[6303.53s -> 6314.26s]  anyone wants to sell me something. Sorry about all that. Oh, rifle. Get rifle. Get rifle. Get
[6314.26s -> 6331.45s]  rifle. Get rifle. Okay, all right, man. All right, so clear the ambush camp. Sure thing.
[6331.45s -> 6338.23s]  So there's a couple more people here. Let me upgrade this.
[6344.90s -> 6366.07s]  Video games. Oh, wait, I need to repair the bike. No, give me the... Do I have it?
[6366.39s -> 6397.72s]  Do I have the rifle? It's on your back. Is it repaired? No, I'm using scrap metal to fix it.
[6397.72s -> 6403.27s]  All right, cool. I need to see. You know what I mean? I have to test and see if this works.
[6404.07s -> 6408.41s]  This is more important than anything else in the whole game. Am I going to sneak up on
[6408.41s -> 6415.22s]  somebody and we have to do the cool thing, the desperate thing to have five million of these
[6415.22s -> 6448.06s]  lying around? Because they want you to do this and I'm gonna do it. Well, he did it. It works.
[6455.00s -> 6458.84s]  By the way, that wouldn't even happen. Where am I? Am I all the way back here?
[6462.31s -> 6479.18s]  Of course it works. What did I end up? Oh, I have to do that again. That's what I want you
[6479.18s -> 6489.72s]  to do. Yeah, it is. I'm gonna turn off the headlights. This time I'm not just gonna drive
[6489.72s -> 6494.86s]  straight in. I'm gonna leave the bike at the door. All right, all right, all right, all right.
[6494.86s -> 6499.02s]  Now we're gonna just clear the camp. I'm gonna do this nice and slow and skillfully.
[6506.52s -> 6509.59s]  What? What am I holding? Is this a cocktail?
[6509.75s -> 6530.50s]  Something's out here, you asshole. Someone's hit. He's hiding. Look for him.
[6530.50s -> 6541.96s]  Where's that coming from? I don't know. He's dead. Uh, yeah.
[6557.48s -> 6569.70s]  I didn't think you could actually hit them with the frog. Damn it. Where is he? Um,
[6574.04s -> 6600.76s]  he's covering fire. A squirrel dropped an acorn on me. Shoot to kill. Dude,
[6600.76s -> 6609.14s]  I just felt this lady with rocks. Uh-oh. Who? Who found me? Is he shooting at her?
[6609.86s -> 6627.40s]  Are you the one throwing rocks? Are they even shooting at me? He's flanking me. Oh,
[6627.96s -> 6663.16s]  all right. Well, I had my fun. I'm supposed to do this stealthily. Hold on. Let me search
[6663.16s -> 6673.22s]  their bodies. All right. This is what I'm talking about here, man. Get them both. I
[6673.22s -> 6687.54s]  need ammo for this. I don't have any ammo. Can I even replace the uh, I don't think I
[6687.54s -> 6692.50s]  can even replace the crossbow. It's primary. Get rifle. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[6693.06s -> 6699.94s]  Check this out. All right. We're fine. There we go. Let's just take them out. Nice and slow.
[6699.94s -> 6711.80s]  Do it right. They're throwing rocks at us. How many are them? I don't know. They might be
[6711.80s -> 6734.55s]  200. Where did you come from? They shoot when I'm... You guys are really stupid.
[6735.19s -> 6746.95s]  He's pretending to be dead. They're playing a gigantic game of telephone.
[6757.69s -> 6763.69s]  Hey, he shot me and then distance. He's been shot. Somebody shot him. Somebody shot him.
[6765.42s -> 6795.42s]  Boom. Oh, God. What happened here? Kill me. All right. I think I just alerted the horde.
[6797.86s -> 6821.32s]  Did I really? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Where is he? He's not here. Where's this guy?
[6821.32s -> 6848.33s]  You got him. What do you mean, got him? Oh, fuck. All right. Hold on. This is my opportunity
[6848.33s -> 6863.99s]  to do this. Watch this. Ready? I gotta get this right. Go that way. Go that way so I can
[6863.99s -> 6880.23s]  throw it in the fire. Who killed who there? I don't know. Did the eye die there? Who's
[6880.23s -> 6885.62s]  got the... Who killed... Who killed who? Hey, where is he? Have we got some tail? You know,
[6885.62s -> 6895.82s]  we got... Moonshine! I stabbed myself in the stomach. He's gonna get the same spiel.
[6924.15s -> 6933.26s]  He tricked me. He tricked me. Wait, I'm gonna go get another one. Just stay there.
[6934.22s -> 6948.49s]  He's dumb. I'll be fine. Is somebody in this building? He's gonna come in here, isn't he?
[6953.22s -> 6969.64s]  What's head level right here? Right. Whoa! I thought the gun... I thought the rock was
[6969.64s -> 6994.63s]  a fucking explosive bullet rock for a second. Where'd he go? Get in here. Yeah, I'm in there.
[6995.27s -> 7009.08s]  Come on in. Just step in the door. Step inside of here. Okay, he's gonna get covered.
[7012.06s -> 7042.70s]  Don't fall back. Get in. Did they seriously run away? All right, that's enough.
[7058.66s -> 7069.59s]  I'm pissed off. Let's go. Let's heal and let's get out of here. Exclusive. This is an exclusive
[7069.59s -> 7074.49s]  game. This is a Sony PlayStation exclusive. You can only get this on the PlayStation 4.
[7085.94s -> 7090.02s]  Turn up the difficulty. I feel like that would make the game harder, though.
[7090.66s -> 7097.77s]  You know, that makes the game difficult. I don't do that. You gotta get a PS4. Get one. Oh.
[7098.49s -> 7103.91s]  Hey. If you had bullets, I wouldn't be breathing now, would I? You've been the one
[7103.91s -> 7112.23s]  throwing rocks. Please, mister. Don't shoot women if I have a choice. I have a choice.
[7112.23s -> 7124.95s]  I ain't got nothing. I got nowhere to go. You got it that way. What is your opportunity?
[7125.99s -> 7136.78s]  There's always some way. All right, let's see if they got an underground bunker around here.
[7136.78s -> 7149.35s]  Investigate the bunker. I got nowhere to go. We all got nowhere to go. Yes. I mean,
[7149.35s -> 7184.41s]  here it is. I can't even slide down. I can't fast go down. I can't really. Nothing in here besides
[7185.45s -> 7195.24s]  the storyline. Stupid. Stupid. There it is. I had to get it right, sorry. Looks like they
[7195.24s -> 7207.56s]  marked it up good. 91% that's an A-. Gear up for the ride. Me and Boozer can't ride north
[7207.56s -> 7214.22s]  until I fix up this bike. Get some better gear. Craft unlocked. Ambush camp hunter.
[7214.22s -> 7227.80s]  I can make people. Spiked bat. Yes, yes, yes. Newly discovered craft recipes are shown in the
[7227.80s -> 7240.33s]  survival wheel. Yes, yes, yes. It sounded like bike engines riding somewhere on the mountain.
[7240.33s -> 7245.94s]  I just finished clearing it. Use a bunk at safe locations like bunkers or the safe houses
[7245.94s -> 7249.78s]  to leave in advance time. Some challenges like infestations can be approached differently
[7249.78s -> 7253.54s]  depending on the time of day. Additionally, progress can be saved when you're a bunk.
[7253.54s -> 7256.78s]  The radio tower for Copeland. Climb the tower. See if I can see.
[7257.58s -> 7268.52s]  We're gonna climb the tower. I'm just gonna close my eyes for a little bit.
[7281.46s -> 7287.24s]  I'm still on the phone. You know, you say some real fucked up shit and you sleep.
[7287.24s -> 7292.94s]  I don't think I've ever heard somebody say they want to shove an ice cream up their ass.
[7294.58s -> 7319.85s]  Cold side first. All right, let's go. Get up. Oh, it's X. What the fuck?
[7323.29s -> 7345.83s]  That sounds like a one guy comment. Don't sound like yourself. It's nothing. You know,
[7345.83s -> 7351.51s]  I just let this drifter get the drop on me. Lucky for me, she was out of ammo.
[7351.51s -> 7354.52s]  You know, the game's boring and the streamer is always too ass jokes.
[7355.96s -> 7360.66s]  Yes, yes, I let her go. It's a climbable tower.
[7364.31s -> 7369.11s]  Yeah, well, something's gonna do it, right? Does it matter what Deacon out?
[7369.83s -> 7377.94s]  Jesus, what a climb. All right, let's see what the hell was just talking about.
[7377.94s -> 7381.62s]  All right, look at the O'Leary Mountain safe house. It's doing it for me, so don't worry.
[7382.10s -> 7387.05s]  We're right. Someone's on the mountain. I see smoke from their campfire.
[7388.49s -> 7392.84s]  Son of a bitch. I knew I heard something. Where are they? I'm gonna head out there.
[7392.84s -> 7397.24s]  No, god damn it. Boozer, gotta get your arm healed up so we can ride the hell out of here.
[7397.24s -> 7403.32s]  I'll take care of him. Mark, it's just, I'm going a little stir crazy here, Deacon.
[7405.27s -> 7408.95s]  Just try to stay awake in case they head your way. Deacon out.
[7409.91s -> 7414.81s]  There's no, I can't jump. Do I actually have to climb down this?
[7415.45s -> 7420.62s]  I don't want to do the whole climb again. I can't slide.
[7429.85s -> 7432.89s]  Leap of faith. No, but I mean, there's no, I can like, no.
[7433.85s -> 7435.67s]  I guess this is how you actually would do it.
[7452.14s -> 7464.63s]  I just had to go up and down the ladder. That's it.
[7466.04s -> 7469.40s]  Locate the camp. All right, can I call my bike and I whistle from my bike?
[7482.20s -> 7486.76s]  Now you can fall off. Now you fall off and take damage when you fall.
[7487.40s -> 7495.40s]  Took us this far to figure that out. All right, there's a...
[7504.95s -> 7516.01s]  Encore. Encore. Encore. I could do that. That's bullshit.
[7516.81s -> 7521.42s]  I swear to god I could fall down this. I could go down that. I know I could.
[7528.81s -> 7532.54s]  Look, that was the difference. That's not much of a difference.
[7532.94s -> 7535.90s]  That's amazing. Yeah, I do need some. Deacon out.
[7535.90s -> 7543.24s]  I need my bike. Oh, fuck. There's my bike behind me the whole time.
[7551.75s -> 7555.03s]  No, I'm not doing it again. It's not gonna be the third encore.
[7555.03s -> 7568.90s]  No, it was right here. Okay. All right, we're good. Let's move on.
[7574.33s -> 7578.31s]  Wow, what the hell? Can I climb this?
[7581.26s -> 7584.62s]  You wouldn't put a tree bent over like this if I couldn't just tightrope on it, right?
[7585.26s -> 7596.82s]  I guess so. Gunfire. Does that mean anything?
[7597.54s -> 7619.78s]  Who's shooting? Oh, that's the motorcycle doing that.
[7627.51s -> 7633.50s]  I'm out of gas. Mechanics can repair or refuel your bike for a fee.
[7633.50s -> 7635.50s]  The price adds up, so take care of your bike when you can.
[7637.42s -> 7640.46s]  While your bike is idle, you can walk it backward or forward.
[7640.46s -> 7642.38s]  If you're trying to be quiet or you're out of gas,
[7642.38s -> 7644.78s]  you can walk your bike around as long as the path isn't too steep.
[7645.66s -> 7667.06s]  How do I walk it? No, I have to walk the bike.
[7668.36s -> 7678.92s]  No, I'm sorry. I have to... Just leave me alone. I don't want anything...
[7695.96s -> 7698.04s]  They're still fucking chasing me. I'm out of stamina.
[7698.60s -> 7700.46s]  All right, I have to... desperate.
[7710.81s -> 7714.01s]  Please, just leave me alone. I don't want to kill anybody. I don't want to kill you.
[7714.01s -> 7729.82s]  I have to. Unfortunately, I have to.
[7729.82s -> 7735.43s]  My god, he's faster than I can aim.
[7736.31s -> 7742.31s]  You leaving? The stick aiming is slower than he can move.
[7743.03s -> 7745.21s]  How many... What the fuck?
[7745.93s -> 7749.05s]  No way, dude! Oh my god!
[7757.54s -> 7761.61s]  All right, let me walk the bike. How do I walk the bike?
[7763.26s -> 7764.86s]  Did it tell me a button combination?
[7766.41s -> 7769.45s]  No, I'm out in front of the coin-operated toy in front of Walmart.
[7778.76s -> 7779.64s]  It's too steep.
[7781.77s -> 7782.57s]  No, it's not.
[7787.86s -> 7792.09s]  No, I'm good. I'm on my tricycle.
[7792.09s -> 7800.31s]  I see a gas station. I'm fine.
[7807.38s -> 7809.46s]  On the road, where it's safe.
[7809.46s -> 7814.42s]  And then I can just glide. Yeah, now I can just glide.
[7830.50s -> 7831.62s]  Cool gameplay.
[7837.78s -> 7843.32s]  I'll get there eventually.
[7843.32s -> 7844.44s]  What happens if I leave the bike?
[7845.24s -> 7849.10s]  Can I get the bike back eventually?
[7849.10s -> 7851.10s]  Or is it one of those scenarios where I have to keep it with me?
[7851.10s -> 7853.82s]  St. John to Copeland's camp is done.
[7853.82s -> 7857.66s]  The radio tower's locked down and I've restored your radio buffling.
[7858.86s -> 7863.02s]  Not see the value in St. John.
[7863.02s -> 7867.10s]  But radio-free Oregon is the only thing keeping us from turning into savages.
[7869.58s -> 7871.42s]  A wheelchair would be faster.
[7871.42s -> 7872.94s]  Savages is about nine square meals.
[7873.58s -> 7875.58s]  Try going hungry for three days.
[7875.58s -> 7877.74s]  There's no such thing as a starving patriot.
[7878.46s -> 7880.94s]  Well, sir, booze man, I have your word.
[7880.94s -> 7883.26s]  They set up all the railroad tracks.
[7883.26s -> 7884.62s]  There's got to be gas in here.
[7884.62s -> 7885.34s]  There's going to be gas.
[7885.34s -> 7887.66s]  Kill every one of the sons of bitches.
[7887.66s -> 7891.53s]  Gas? Come on.
[7896.02s -> 7896.90s]  Ooh, fire axe.
[7913.93s -> 7915.05s]  Can I craft gas?
[7919.54s -> 7920.98s]  I'm not sure I can craft.
[7920.98s -> 7921.94s]  Can I craft?
[7921.94s -> 7923.38s]  That's just a tractor.
[7926.74s -> 7927.38s]  Pipe bombs.
[7929.30s -> 7930.26s]  Pipe bomb, huh?
[7930.26s -> 7930.98s]  Where did I get these?
[7931.94s -> 7935.45s]  By holding L2 and aim to press to throw.
[7936.76s -> 7937.26s]  Well.
[7962.01s -> 7966.20s]  Is that going to explode?
[7970.86s -> 7972.06s]  Hey, somebody's hit.
[7973.66s -> 7977.10s]  It had nothing to do with the pipe bomb.
[7996.98s -> 7997.86s]  I'm not unkillable.
[7997.86s -> 7999.22s]  See, I can still play on normal.
[7999.86s -> 8004.71s]  Do I have gas?
[8007.75s -> 8009.11s]  Hey, hey, wait, wait.
[8009.11s -> 8010.47s]  Why am I already in combat?
[8024.95s -> 8029.08s]  I can't die on the bike.
[8037.88s -> 8040.79s]  That was a fucking marionette on my leg.
[8040.79s -> 8041.67s]  All right, here we go.
[8049.88s -> 8052.92s]  Maybe you should stop screaming shit and attracting people.
[8057.06s -> 8058.58s]  Yeah, you just heard gunshots.
[8060.12s -> 8061.24s]  I think they're shooting at me.
[8062.86s -> 8063.58s]  I'm not good.
[8063.58s -> 8064.86s]  I might be mistaken though.
[8065.50s -> 8070.27s]  Brax.
[8094.09s -> 8095.21s]  No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
[8095.21s -> 8095.85s]  You're getting stuck.
[8095.85s -> 8097.05s]  Stop getting stuck.
[8097.05s -> 8119.18s]  Okay, can I please just get out of here?
[8119.18s -> 8125.54s]  He shot me.
[8126.18s -> 8127.14s]  Why did he shoot me?
[8127.78s -> 8142.18s]  I'm about to roll up in there and just start swinging.
[8142.18s -> 8147.13s]  All right, let me search.
[8154.22s -> 8163.22s]  I gotta, just go, go, go, go.
[8163.22s -> 8164.02s]  Just walk it this way.
[8164.02s -> 8164.58s]  Who cares?
[8164.58s -> 8165.06s]  I don't care.
[8165.62s -> 8184.49s]  I have to go down here.
[8187.54s -> 8188.66s]  All right, I'm not fucking around.
[8189.30s -> 8189.94s]  Not anymore.
[8199.26s -> 8199.76s]  Come on.
[8220.60s -> 8221.48s]  He has one of those too.
[8222.36s -> 8234.14s]  Like a bear trap.
[8234.14s -> 8234.78s]  What?
[8234.78s -> 8253.24s]  Can he go in this?
[8258.36s -> 8259.08s]  Put it under him.
[8268.17s -> 8272.25s]  Hey, how did he not go on the ground and catch my leg?
[8280.81s -> 8282.17s]  Heel, heel, heel, heel, heel.
[8284.50s -> 8285.70s]  Oh my god.
[8285.70s -> 8287.22s]  How do I have another one?
[8287.22s -> 8289.11s]  Plus three bear trap.
[8289.11s -> 8290.47s]  Plus four bear trap.
[8290.47s -> 8293.99s]  Plus five, six, seven, eight.
[8293.99s -> 8295.35s]  I just get infinite bear trap.
[8295.99s -> 8316.50s]  I could sell these too.
[8324.02s -> 8324.90s]  He's duping.
[8325.54s -> 8327.06s]  He's resorted to duping.
[8327.78s -> 8337.83s]  All right, I'll do it with 50.
[8337.83s -> 8346.12s]  50 is like, it's gonna be like five grand.
[8346.12s -> 8346.68s]  Okay.
[8346.68s -> 8372.79s]  Where's bear trap?
[8372.79s -> 8374.39s]  So I don't have any.
[8374.39s -> 8375.82s]  How do I not have any?
[8375.82s -> 8379.99s]  It says plus 50.
[8379.99s -> 8403.18s]  Waiting to jump me.
[8405.93s -> 8406.73s]  Step in it.
[8407.78s -> 8410.23s]  Oh, no.
[8411.11s -> 8411.91s]  You're not gonna roll.
[8411.91s -> 8413.43s]  Oh fuck, I have no ammo.
[8413.43s -> 8423.61s]  Oh, you dick.
[8423.61s -> 8429.21s]  Pick it up.
[8429.21s -> 8430.25s]  Mother fucker.
[8430.25s -> 8451.27s]  You talking to me?
[8451.27s -> 8452.71s]  Yeah, nice job, man.
[8452.71s -> 8453.35s]  Kill him.
[8453.35s -> 8461.46s]  That guy sucked you out of me 20 bucks.
[8461.46s -> 8463.35s]  All right, there's only one guy left, all right?
[8463.35s -> 8475.59s]  This guy right here is two.
[8475.59s -> 8477.11s]  We're gonna kill the guy with the handgun.
[8477.67s -> 8495.50s]  Okay, give me the fucking bear trap.
[8495.50s -> 8496.14s]  I have to do this.
[8496.78s -> 8498.14s]  This is so important.
[8498.14s -> 8525.99s]  Where'd he go?
[8525.99s -> 8527.77s]  Is he behind?
[8527.77s -> 8528.49s]  Where is he?
[8528.49s -> 8531.02s]  Oh fuck, he's right there.
[8531.74s -> 8538.82s]  Come on, do it.
[8538.82s -> 8540.02s]  Just come over here.
[8540.02s -> 8543.21s]  I need to see this, if it's possible.
[8543.21s -> 8544.76s]  If not, then who cares, right?
[8545.32s -> 8550.42s]  If I'm hidden for long and I feel he comes out,
[8550.42s -> 8552.50s]  because he can't see me.
[8552.50s -> 8555.45s]  Come on, come out.
[8561.69s -> 8563.53s]  Oh fuck, he's going, he's wrapping the other way.
[8563.53s -> 8564.57s]  Give me, hold on.
[8564.57s -> 8566.89s]  Don't take this.
[8566.89s -> 8567.91s]  Where is he?
[8567.91s -> 8568.47s]  It's right there.
[8568.95s -> 8572.26s]  I don't think he knows where I am.
[8573.96s -> 8575.08s]  Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[8575.08s -> 8576.20s]  Okay, here we go, ready?
[8576.20s -> 8597.18s]  Oh my god, which way is he going?
[8597.18s -> 8601.32s]  I haven't moved from this spot.
[8601.32s -> 8602.76s]  How would you not know where I was?
[8602.76s -> 8604.68s]  This is our opportunity.
[8604.68s -> 8606.02s]  Here it comes.
[8606.02s -> 8613.99s]  Should I just sneak up behind him?
[8613.99s -> 8615.51s]  Okay, here's the plan, ready?
[8615.51s -> 8620.87s]  The plan is throw a rock, sneak up behind him.
[8620.87s -> 8630.41s]  He's not listening to the rock.
[8630.41s -> 8631.85s]  I can't, I can't tell if he's,
[8631.85s -> 8632.33s]  what's he doing?
[8632.33s -> 8633.53s]  He's so erratic right now.
[8633.53s -> 8640.65s]  He's not listening anymore.
[8640.65s -> 8648.22s]  Okay, I'm gonna try something.
[8648.22s -> 8649.90s]  One, two, three.
[8649.90s -> 8659.05s]  I don't know where he went.
[8659.05s -> 8659.93s]  Where'd he go?
[8659.93s -> 8661.42s]  Where the fuck did he go?
[8661.98s -> 8662.94s]  Where did he go?
[8662.94s -> 8663.58s]  Where did he go?
[8666.36s -> 8667.56s]  Is he behind me?
[8667.56s -> 8672.01s]  Where did he go?
[8672.01s -> 8673.05s]  Is he behind the tent?
[8693.32s -> 8697.30s]  God damn it.
[8697.30s -> 8701.19s]  All right, I tried, I tried.
[8701.19s -> 8703.11s]  Oh fuck, I don't want to do this again.
[8703.11s -> 8705.11s]  Okay, I'm just gonna do this as fast as possible now.
[8719.22s -> 8719.86s]  Hold on, I'll get it.
[8719.86s -> 8721.06s]  Just wait, I'm gonna do it really fast.
[8721.06s -> 8722.82s]  I'm gonna make sure I get this done like right now.
[8727.82s -> 8728.94s]  Oh, I can't even go back.
[8729.66s -> 8730.16s]  Bitches.
[8746.25s -> 8747.77s]  You have a shotgun.
[8749.51s -> 8750.55s]  There's no way.
[8768.71s -> 8769.75s]  No, fuck, what?
[8770.95s -> 8773.29s]  No, take it seriously, please.
[8775.85s -> 8779.37s]  Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[8781.05s -> 8808.38s]  Wait, I just like froze him in time.
[8809.50s -> 8810.94s]  He's still, oh no.
[8812.84s -> 8815.16s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[8815.16s -> 8816.60s]  I put it in the trap.
[8826.94s -> 8827.66s]  What trap?
[8828.46s -> 8830.38s]  I put the other one down to my left.
[8830.38s -> 8831.42s]  I picked, didn't I pick that?
[8834.62s -> 8836.78s]  Here we go, this is for real this time.
[8837.58s -> 8842.44s]  I was stupid to pay attention to the guy that was on the cliff.
[8847.16s -> 8849.00s]  I know I put the one down to my left,
[8849.00s -> 8850.60s]  but I didn't pick the one up to my right.
[8852.30s -> 8853.82s]  No, I want to go up here.
[8853.82s -> 8855.50s]  What's with every game nowadays?
[8856.46s -> 8858.94s]  Your hitbox is like five people wide.
[8860.25s -> 8861.61s]  I want to like go over here.
[8861.61s -> 8863.53s]  It's like, you didn't want to like run out here
[8863.53s -> 8865.29s]  all the way over here and then stop.
[8866.01s -> 8867.03s]  All right, here we go.
[8867.03s -> 8868.87s]  Fucking mad because bad.
[8868.87s -> 8869.91s]  Mad because bad.
[8869.91s -> 8870.79s]  Mad because bad.
[8876.33s -> 8877.77s]  Thank God I slid through it.
[8904.04s -> 8904.60s]  What the hell?
[8905.72s -> 8907.77s]  What the hell?
[8907.77s -> 8908.73s]  What is this thing over here?
[8909.45s -> 8916.31s]  There's no trap, don't worry.
[8916.31s -> 8922.82s]  Oh my fucking god damn.
[8922.82s -> 8923.86s]  Now you have shotguns.
[8923.86s -> 8925.78s]  Now you're shooting the shotgun with ease.
[8926.50s -> 8935.24s]  No, give me the...
[8935.88s -> 8944.89s]  They just always appear behind me.
[8950.97s -> 8956.71s]  Okay, so I need to stop fucking around.
[8956.71s -> 8974.58s]  They're still alive.
[8974.58s -> 8975.54s]  Oh, you motherfucker.
[8975.54s -> 8987.74s]  No, I have one bullet left.
[8988.30s -> 9006.90s]  Dude, how many people are in this camp?
[9006.90s -> 9029.67s]  How many bullets do I have?
[9029.67s -> 9030.55s]  Is the ammo in here?
[9030.55s -> 9034.49s]  What am I doing?
[9034.49s -> 9035.66s]  No, I want that.
[9035.66s -> 9036.14s]  I want...
[9036.14s -> 9036.86s]  I don't want this.
[9037.50s -> 9037.82s]  I can't...
[9037.82s -> 9039.10s]  I don't have ammo.
[9039.10s -> 9048.57s]  What happened?
[9048.57s -> 9048.97s]  Did I...
[9050.81s -> 9055.37s]  All right, I'm about sick of my incompetence here.
[9056.33s -> 9056.65s]  What is...
[9069.42s -> 9071.02s]  Yes, they set up on the railroad tracks.
[9072.74s -> 9075.56s]  Okay, kill everyone and I...
[9079.91s -> 9083.80s]  Give me my binoculars.
[9084.36s -> 9086.02s]  I want to like mark them.
[9087.37s -> 9088.73s]  Give me my binoculars.
[9088.73s -> 9090.73s]  Why can't I not use my binoculars to mark people?
[9091.37s -> 9092.57s]  They've made such a big deal of that.
[9093.13s -> 9112.39s]  I want the rock.
[9113.11s -> 9117.40s]  All right, what the fuck are you doing?
[9119.06s -> 9120.10s]  Category distraction.
[9120.66s -> 9121.30s]  Put the...
[9121.30s -> 9122.42s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[9122.42s -> 9123.30s]  Put the rock on.
[9124.26s -> 9125.06s]  I want the rock.
[9127.99s -> 9129.03s]  What the hell is going on?
[9129.59s -> 9136.22s]  Do I not have any more rocks?
[9145.69s -> 9148.49s]  All right, somebody's gotta explain to me why I can't select the rock.
[9149.13s -> 9161.21s]  It doesn't like me.
[9161.85s -> 9162.97s]  I think I'm just gonna go...
[9162.97s -> 9163.77s]  I'm just killing them.
[9163.77s -> 9164.97s]  Like, we're just gonna kill them.
[9164.97s -> 9165.69s]  I'm just gonna kill them.
[9165.69s -> 9166.41s]  I just have to make this...
[9166.41s -> 9166.97s]  They're all right here.
[9166.97s -> 9167.37s]  Watch this.
[9167.37s -> 9167.61s]  Ready?
[9167.61s -> 9168.81s]  I'm gonna get one shot here.
[9169.37s -> 9169.61s]  Kill.
[9170.73s -> 9171.21s]  Dead.
[9171.21s -> 9172.33s]  No, I hit him right in the head though.
[9181.56s -> 9182.28s]  Oh my god.
[9182.28s -> 9192.97s]  If I just could put my fucking rocks on.
[9193.53s -> 9194.65s]  I'm gonna make these count.
[9212.95s -> 9213.51s]  Almost out.
[9214.07s -> 9228.62s]  I'm gonna get closer.
[9229.99s -> 9230.63s]  Wait for me?
[9230.63s -> 9231.11s]  Huh?
[9231.11s -> 9256.34s]  My god!
[9256.34s -> 9257.54s]  I've seen that coming.
[9267.67s -> 9289.46s]  That's the last of them.
[9290.02s -> 9293.18s]  Let's take the hell off of Leery Mountain.
[9294.22s -> 9295.82s]  You sound like you're having fun.
[9299.05s -> 9300.25s]  I am, actually.
[9300.25s -> 9303.06s]  I have to keep Boozer alive.
[9305.74s -> 9308.30s]  I'm gonna have to go back and walk my car.
[9309.50s -> 9320.39s]  Boozer, he's done.
[9326.15s -> 9327.91s]  Boozer, he's done.
[9327.91s -> 9328.71s]  Squad of camp.
[9329.43s -> 9331.67s]  They won't be doing any more killing on O'Leery Mountain.
[9332.39s -> 9337.91s]  Hank, I should have been there.
[9338.71s -> 9340.15s]  Another bear trap joke.
[9341.99s -> 9344.07s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9344.07s -> 9345.43s]  Rest up, booze man.
[9345.43s -> 9347.83s]  Rest up before we ride north as soon as your army heals.
[9347.83s -> 9348.39s]  You got that?
[9349.03s -> 9350.07s]  Jerem's fuming, dude.
[9350.07s -> 9351.11s]  He's fuming, he's fuming.
[9362.68s -> 9363.16s]  Let's go.
[9363.72s -> 9365.98s]  Yeah, I'm gonna ride up to the cemetery.
[9366.62s -> 9368.22s]  See if I can find the hot stash.
[9369.42s -> 9370.06s]  Sorry.
[9370.06s -> 9371.26s]  There's no gas down there.
[9372.54s -> 9373.74s]  Rest up, Boozer.
[9373.74s -> 9375.42s]  We're heading north as soon as you can ride.
[9381.50s -> 9383.74s]  Out of nowhere map.
[9383.74s -> 9384.62s]  Where are we going?
[9384.62s -> 9385.42s]  Storylines.
[9385.98s -> 9389.02s]  View story progress, view gameplay rewards, and activate missions.
[9391.64s -> 9394.20s]  So, crazy Willy's infestation.
[9394.84s -> 9395.56s]  World's end.
[9397.11s -> 9399.27s]  Or out of chasing Leon.
[9399.27s -> 9400.07s]  Out of nowhere.
[9400.07s -> 9403.19s]  Search the pioneer cemetery for Leon's drug stash.
[9403.19s -> 9404.65s]  That's the one we're gonna do.
[9406.98s -> 9407.54s]  God damn it.
[9408.34s -> 9410.66s]  786 meters this way.
[9412.98s -> 9414.97s]  Deke, you there?
[9414.97s -> 9416.65s]  Just give me some forward momentum.
[9416.65s -> 9417.77s]  Did you say you were heading north?
[9417.77s -> 9418.94s]  Booze man, no.
[9422.79s -> 9423.59s]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[9423.59s -> 9424.55s]  I just kind of...
[9424.55s -> 9425.67s]  There's no gas down here.
[9427.62s -> 9429.22s]  Third degree burns will do that to you.
[9432.23s -> 9434.79s]  So, take care of Alvarez, you know?
[9434.79s -> 9435.43s]  Let me just check.
[9435.99s -> 9437.11s]  Deke, there's a lot to do.
[9437.11s -> 9438.39s]  Better get walking.
[9438.39s -> 9439.11s]  Yeah, I know.
[9439.11s -> 9440.47s]  I better start moving.
[9440.47s -> 9441.75s]  Take care of her, Boozer.
[9441.75s -> 9443.67s]  Just get some rest.
[9443.67s -> 9444.31s]  Deke, get out.
[9444.87s -> 9446.23s]  I can't like dump that in the tank.
[9456.71s -> 9459.75s]  Imagine unironically thinking you were a GTA character.
[9473.16s -> 9474.92s]  Biggest vroom ever.
[9474.92s -> 9475.32s]  Maybe.
[9485.26s -> 9486.62s]  Nah, I don't think so, Cope.
[9486.62s -> 9487.18s]  Not today.
[9488.82s -> 9489.46s]  All right, I need to go...
[9489.46s -> 9489.86s]  Here we go.
[9489.86s -> 9490.58s]  I see a car.
[9490.58s -> 9491.62s]  I see a gas station.
[9491.62s -> 9493.06s]  We just have to coast our way into it.
[9494.26s -> 9495.78s]  Gas station right there.
[9495.78s -> 9496.28s]  Cars.
[9503.32s -> 9503.88s]  What the fuck?
[9506.39s -> 9507.67s]  What was that?
[9507.67s -> 9508.17s]  Why?
[9508.87s -> 9509.37s]  What?
[9510.71s -> 9512.07s]  I needed that gas.
[9512.07s -> 9513.43s]  Who has a sniper?
[9515.56s -> 9517.80s]  What in the fucking name of God is happening?
[9518.52s -> 9529.77s]  Give me that thing.
[9535.40s -> 9535.80s]  Oh, fuck.
[9535.80s -> 9536.68s]  I have no more...
[9536.84s -> 9539.00s]  Please, please, please, please, please, please heal.
[9552.01s -> 9554.73s]  I don't understand why somebody just drove a flaming car down at me.
[9554.73s -> 9555.69s]  Where was the car?
[9557.35s -> 9558.55s]  What was the set?
[9558.55s -> 9560.15s]  They just came out of nowhere.
[9564.31s -> 9565.27s]  Some guns are so powerful,
[9565.27s -> 9568.57s]  their shots can pierce through multiple enemies with one round.
[9568.57s -> 9570.17s]  Trying lining up multiple enemies.
[9570.17s -> 9570.67s]  Okay.
[9574.36s -> 9575.48s]  Shot the place up.
[9575.48s -> 9577.92s]  Then he just took off.
[9577.92s -> 9580.22s]  And he said his box got erected.
[9580.22s -> 9582.32s]  He was wearing some kind of motocross helmet.
[9582.32s -> 9582.82s]  Silver.
[9583.60s -> 9586.08s]  Okay, if I go now, I might be able to catch up to him.
[9587.37s -> 9588.97s]  I want him alive, Deke.
[9588.97s -> 9590.10s]  Alive.
[9590.10s -> 9591.28s]  I needed that gas that was in this car.
[9591.28s -> 9591.78s]  Alive.
[9592.56s -> 9595.21s]  You catch this guy, then radio me.
[9595.21s -> 9600.04s]  Fetch him and hang the bastard right from this time we start showing these drifters,
[9600.04s -> 9602.12s]  sons of bitches, that we have law and order in this kingdom.
[9602.12s -> 9603.16s]  One bullet in this.
[9603.16s -> 9603.88s]  No offence meant to yourself.
[9603.88s -> 9604.68s]  I better be ready.
[9605.64s -> 9606.52s]  All right, let's get it up.
[9606.52s -> 9607.08s]  I'll take it.
[9607.08s -> 9607.80s]  I'll find him.
[9609.92s -> 9611.10s]  How's this thing doing?
[9611.82s -> 9614.22s]  You can't boost without equipping your bike with nitrous.
[9615.64s -> 9615.96s]  Thanks.
[9619.48s -> 9621.24s]  All right, let's go.
[9624.57s -> 9626.01s]  I can't believe there's no gas over here.
[9631.90s -> 9633.02s]  I'm gonna check down there.
[9633.66s -> 9636.62s]  There has to be gas over here.
[9636.62s -> 9637.58s]  Has to be. Look it.
[9637.58s -> 9639.50s]  It's like a bunch of big gas tanks right there.
[9646.96s -> 9647.46s]  Gas?
[9652.65s -> 9653.29s]  Gas.
[9653.29s -> 9654.57s]  Give me something to gas.
[9655.45s -> 9656.01s]  Anything.
[9657.44s -> 9657.94s]  Please.
[9672.16s -> 9672.66s]  Gas.
[9673.84s -> 9674.72s]  No, no gas.
[9675.52s -> 9680.97s]  Are you serious?
[9681.69s -> 9692.09s]  It's just like a lighter fluid.
[9692.09s -> 9692.73s]  It's not gas.
[9694.80s -> 9695.52s]  Oh, found it.
[9696.32s -> 9696.88s]  Thank god.
[9702.08s -> 9703.60s]  Fill it up and get me out of here.
[9714.60s -> 9715.56s]  Fill it up.
[9715.56s -> 9722.08s]  All right, repair the bike because I just got run over.
[9725.12s -> 9727.84s]  Finally, it's gonna feel so good to actually be able to ride this thing again.
[9728.64s -> 9732.81s]  Feels so different.
[9737.28s -> 9738.59s]  Let's go.
[9741.93s -> 9743.05s]  The boos are...
[9743.05s -> 9744.01s]  No, no.
[9744.01s -> 9745.13s]  You're gonna get yourself killed.
[9745.85s -> 9748.09s]  You're gonna wait till you're whole, brother.
[9749.61s -> 9750.65s]  Nitrous, too.
[9750.65s -> 9753.93s]  I'm over here anyway, so I'll take care of that mess.
[9753.93s -> 9754.49s]  Right up here.
[9757.76s -> 9761.04s]  All right, clear the logging camp infestation zone.
[9762.08s -> 9768.73s]  You just ran two stopsides.
[9768.73s -> 9769.21s]  That's fine.
[9769.21s -> 9769.93s]  There's nobody here.
[9770.65s -> 9780.75s]  I feel like it's just...
[9780.75s -> 9781.39s]  Yeah, let's just...
[9781.39s -> 9782.83s]  I'm cutting through here.
[9782.83s -> 9783.79s]  I'm not gonna follow the road.
[9783.79s -> 9784.99s]  The GPS in this game is dumb.
[9786.19s -> 9788.59s]  It's a post-apocalyptic world.
[9788.59s -> 9789.79s]  You don't have to follow the roads.
[9801.28s -> 9802.08s]  Shit.
[9802.08s -> 9803.21s]  Can I jump it?
[9803.85s -> 9807.23s]  This is Radio Free Oregon.
[9807.23s -> 9809.47s]  The truth shall set you free.
[9809.47s -> 9811.60s]  This earth is a gift for us all.
[9811.60s -> 9812.40s]  Okay, I'm good.
[9812.40s -> 9814.08s]  To use as we see fit.
[9814.80s -> 9817.20s]  To provide for ourselves and our families.
[9818.40s -> 9819.20s]  I'm not saying this.
[9819.92s -> 9822.64s]  It's the Lord that gave us dominion over it.
[9822.64s -> 9824.76s]  But that wasn't enough for some men.
[9825.56s -> 9826.76s]  They wanted more.
[9826.76s -> 9830.48s]  When our fuel down, they jacked up the prices
[9830.48s -> 9833.20s]  so they could consolidate power into their own hands.
[9834.24s -> 9836.88s]  So we wanted to build dams for electricity.
[9837.76s -> 9839.52s]  But they're precious runs of salmon.
[9839.52s -> 9840.40s]  Coke, Coke, Coke.
[9840.40s -> 9841.52s]  Shut the hell up.
[9841.52s -> 9841.92s]  Return...
[9841.92s -> 9842.24s]  What do you mean?
[9842.24s -> 9843.36s]  Return to shore.
[9849.76s -> 9850.00s]  What?
[9859.76s -> 9862.97s]  You can't be in water for more than three seconds
[9862.97s -> 9863.53s]  so you drown.
[9864.41s -> 9867.28s]  Closed world game.
[9868.94s -> 9869.34s]  Coin it.
[9869.34s -> 9870.38s]  That's a new phrase, man.
[9873.00s -> 9878.76s]  Why can't you go in the water?
[9878.76s -> 9880.92s]  I mean, very clearly I could go in the water.
[9881.56s -> 9883.79s]  There's even a swimming animation.
[9893.77s -> 9894.65s]  That's really odd.
[9897.05s -> 9899.13s]  If you're gonna have a swimming animation in the game
[9899.13s -> 9900.81s]  and what's the point of making it
[9900.81s -> 9902.73s]  so you can swim for three seconds and die?
[9903.61s -> 9908.38s]  Is this gonna happen again?
[9910.88s -> 9913.60s]  Is it gonna trigger the random event if I go over here?
[9913.60s -> 9914.24s]  No, they're dead.
[9914.88s -> 9919.15s]  That's weird.
[9919.15s -> 9919.95s]  That's very weird.
[9920.75s -> 9924.22s]  But all right, good to know.
[9930.17s -> 9931.21s]  So don't go in...
[9931.21s -> 9931.93s]  What about the bike?
[9932.65s -> 9932.97s]  I need...
[9932.97s -> 9933.61s]  I want to test something here.
[9933.61s -> 9933.93s]  Hold on.
[9934.65s -> 9940.52s]  So the bike can swim, but I can't.
[9941.24s -> 9942.52s]  What if I go in a little deeper?
[9942.52s -> 9943.32s]  I'm just testing.
[9943.96s -> 9966.56s]  Can't get back on the bike.
[9973.95s -> 9974.64s]  Okay.
[9975.36s -> 9988.81s]  I'm sure I'm not getting dragged under by something.
[9989.37s -> 9998.16s]  You can retrieve the bike.
[9998.16s -> 9998.88s]  Oh, that's good to know.
[10001.21s -> 10002.89s]  Taken by the ground demon.
[10004.56s -> 10006.00s]  I would believe that at this point.
[10009.92s -> 10011.28s]  That's so odd.
[10011.28s -> 10012.00s]  But why?
[10013.13s -> 10013.93s]  Is this clear?
[10013.93s -> 10014.57s]  Okay.
[10014.57s -> 10017.21s]  Back in the day, when you went into water,
[10017.21s -> 10018.25s]  you just instantly died.
[10018.25s -> 10020.25s]  You sunk through the earth and it instantly killed you.
[10024.81s -> 10026.25s]  I'm treading water.
[10028.97s -> 10031.12s]  Is it a weight thing?
[10032.08s -> 10038.17s]  I'm gonna make...
[10038.89s -> 10040.25s]  What the fuck, man?
[10040.25s -> 10044.97s]  I'm not sure I want to listen.
[10077.23s -> 10078.67s]  I'm gonna go around.
[10089.37s -> 10092.56s]  In the site here instead of over at site 13.
[10092.56s -> 10093.76s]  How do I turn this off?
[10094.64s -> 10098.52s]  This is the weirdest, longest voicemail I've ever received.
[10106.19s -> 10108.35s]  What audio book did I download?
[10111.23s -> 10117.72s]  What is going on over here?
[10122.52s -> 10123.48s]  Is this a random encounter?
[10123.96s -> 10128.30s]  You gotta take a closer look.
[10128.30s -> 10128.94s]  Water can?
[10129.66s -> 10132.22s]  What is it?
[10132.86s -> 10134.16s]  Upgrade?
[10134.80s -> 10140.11s]  No, it's tracks.
[10140.75s -> 10145.08s]  Let's take a look around.
[10145.08s -> 10146.35s]  Oh, look.
[10146.35s -> 10147.07s]  He dropped something.
[10147.71s -> 10148.99s]  Let's see.
[10149.63s -> 10150.19s]  Drug vent.
[10151.98s -> 10152.62s]  Whatever they're called.
[10153.34s -> 10163.24s]  Survival hint.
[10163.24s -> 10164.04s]  Plants can be easily...
[10164.04s -> 10164.84s]  Yeah.
[10164.84s -> 10167.16s]  Well, where is it now?
[10167.88s -> 10169.18s]  We lost the trail.
[10169.98s -> 10172.28s]  Over here?
[10175.32s -> 10177.15s]  What is it?
[10187.26s -> 10188.06s]  Is that him?
[10188.06s -> 10188.94s]  Should I be sneaking?
[10189.90s -> 10197.66s]  What exactly am I looking for here?
[10198.38s -> 10199.90s]  Am I looking for this person?
[10202.72s -> 10206.43s]  But what am I looking for you for?
[10210.04s -> 10210.68s]  Found you.
[10210.68s -> 10211.96s]  Another bounty.
[10211.96s -> 10213.24s]  Oh, it was a bounty.
[10213.24s -> 10214.12s]  Okay, I get it.
[10226.24s -> 10226.72s]  Use this.
[10236.27s -> 10237.31s]  Don't die from this, please.
[10241.61s -> 10242.33s]  Okay, well.
[10242.33s -> 10242.97s]  Got the bounty.
[10249.26s -> 10252.14s]  I would take point and click Batman over this.
[10256.33s -> 10256.97s]  Come on.
[10256.97s -> 10257.61s]  Like, let...
[10257.61s -> 10259.05s]  Just give it a little bit.
[10259.05s -> 10260.73s]  We're only gonna do this for like a stream
[10260.73s -> 10261.69s]  or maybe another one.
[10261.69s -> 10262.25s]  No, we're not.
[10262.25s -> 10262.65s]  We'll do this...
[10262.65s -> 10264.57s]  This is day gone.
[10264.57s -> 10265.45s]  One day gone.
[10266.01s -> 10273.34s]  We gotta burn them out.
[10273.34s -> 10274.68s]  Make it safer to ride.
[10274.68s -> 10277.26s]  What does that mean?
[10277.26s -> 10279.44s]  We gotta burn them out?
[10281.40s -> 10282.52s]  What am I burning out?
[10283.80s -> 10284.60s]  Oh, I missed the...
[10284.60s -> 10285.40s]  There was three, that...
[10285.40s -> 10286.04s]  Three, whatever.
[10287.00s -> 10287.72s]  I don't want to do that.
[10288.44s -> 10296.11s]  Water!
[10296.11s -> 10296.59s]  It's water!
[10296.59s -> 10296.99s]  No, it's not.
[10296.99s -> 10297.55s]  It's a road.
[10297.55s -> 10297.79s]  Okay.
[10298.59s -> 10310.57s]  Pulling the camera all the way out here
[10310.57s -> 10314.12s]  so we can wait till nighttime.
[10320.51s -> 10321.95s]  Enter Pioneer Cemetery.
[10325.76s -> 10326.64s]  Find the statue.
[10340.30s -> 10346.43s]  I can't open that.
[10346.43s -> 10347.63s]  I think it's gonna alert the horde.
[10350.44s -> 10351.88s]  Don't blink.
[10351.88s -> 10365.20s]  Scrap.
[10365.20s -> 10369.95s]  Yeah.
[10369.95s -> 10371.15s]  Angel statue.
[10371.15s -> 10372.19s]  Anybody see an angel?
[10374.28s -> 10376.28s]  Angel, angel, angel.
[10376.28s -> 10378.36s]  I don't see an angel, but I see this.
[10385.71s -> 10386.51s]  Just you.
[10386.51s -> 10387.63s]  Oh, hey, thanks.
[10388.27s -> 10389.47s]  You're such a sweetie.
[10390.03s -> 10396.36s]  No angel here.
[10399.92s -> 10400.96s]  No band.
[10400.96s -> 10402.16s]  Why would I ban you for saying that?
[10402.16s -> 10403.60s]  That was such a sweet thing to say.
[10403.60s -> 10404.64s]  Leaving the mission zone.
[10416.14s -> 10417.26s]  Leave the zone.
[10417.26s -> 10418.78s]  No, I'm not gonna leave the zone.
[10421.05s -> 10424.33s]  I'm enjoying my closed world game, okay?
[10425.21s -> 10436.40s]  Can I go in here?
[10436.40s -> 10444.91s]  Could it be over this way or something?
[10444.91s -> 10445.63s]  I don't know where it would be.
[10449.79s -> 10451.71s]  I have 15 minutes to switch the game.
[10453.37s -> 10453.93s]  There it is.
[10453.93s -> 10454.49s]  Is that an angel?
[10455.05s -> 10460.41s]  I'm not switching the game.
[10460.41s -> 10461.13s]  Weeping angel.
[10461.69s -> 10463.21s]  This has got to be it.
[10463.21s -> 10463.69s]  I'm not...
[10463.69s -> 10464.73s]  I'm playing this one.
[10464.73s -> 10466.17s]  Where'd you hide the stash, Leon?
[10466.17s -> 10467.45s]  I'm enjoying my time.
[10469.63s -> 10472.43s]  It's just a fun experience to check it out.
[10472.43s -> 10479.05s]  Oh, it...
[10479.05s -> 10480.73s]  Oh, I thought that was a person.
[10480.73s -> 10482.73s]  I was about to go up and sneak and kill this person.
[10497.82s -> 10499.02s]  Take the cooler.
[10499.02s -> 10500.46s]  What, do I got a guy's kidneys?
[10511.52s -> 10512.24s]  Can't climb that.
[10512.24s -> 10513.28s]  A chopper?
[10513.28s -> 10514.22s]  What are you talking about?
[10514.22s -> 10515.02s]  You can't climb this.
[10515.02s -> 10516.86s]  A neurochopper?
[10516.86s -> 10519.82s]  It just buzzed right over me and acted like I wasn't even there.
[10519.82s -> 10523.95s]  All this time and a fed chopper shows up out of nowhere.
[10524.67s -> 10529.50s]  I'm gonna chase them down and I'm gonna see what the hell they're doing.
[10537.24s -> 10538.04s]  Get off of me.
[10541.85s -> 10543.37s]  Oh no, I dropped a beer.
[10544.49s -> 10547.45s]  I gotta get this to the tailgate party.
[10548.01s -> 10558.72s]  What are you doing?
[10558.72s -> 10559.12s]  What do you mean?
[10559.12s -> 10559.52s]  What?
[10559.52s -> 10560.32s]  Get it back to the bike?
[10561.36s -> 10562.80s]  To tie stash to bike.
[10562.80s -> 10563.04s]  I...
[10576.54s -> 10577.42s]  God damn it.
[10578.06s -> 10578.78s]  Wait, what?
[10578.78s -> 10579.66s]  Whose bike is that?
[10594.92s -> 10595.24s]  Why?
[10595.80s -> 10596.20s]  Why?
[10601.24s -> 10603.48s]  I'm not leaving the mission zone.
[10603.48s -> 10603.72s]  Okay?
[10604.60s -> 10605.56s]  I promise you.
[10620.06s -> 10621.90s]  No, if it failed me I would have changed games.
[10634.43s -> 10636.35s]  We were so close.
[10636.35s -> 10637.47s]  No, come on.
[10638.70s -> 10646.81s]  Let me just investigate the helicopter.
[10654.89s -> 10655.53s]  Uh, what...
[10655.53s -> 10656.33s]  What helicopter?
[10656.97s -> 10663.84s]  They're slowing down.
[10664.64s -> 10665.76s]  Looks like they're stopping.
[10666.56s -> 10669.88s]  You're talking to me?
[10669.88s -> 10682.67s]  Who's keeping you hostage to play this?
[10682.91s -> 10694.35s]  We all know you're a comedy genius, but I feel like maybe you've tapped this game for all it's worth.
[10695.15s -> 10697.31s]  You guys don't have very much confidence at all.
[10698.73s -> 10700.97s]  Now that the military's involved, let me...
[10700.97s -> 10711.45s]  Hold on, let me at least just...
[10711.45s -> 10714.28s]  Come on, this game's 60 bucks.
[10716.75s -> 10718.99s]  Dude, I bought the digital deluxe version, too.
[10718.99s -> 10720.81s]  This was like 90 bucks.
[10721.53s -> 10722.73s]  They're immune to attacks.
[10725.63s -> 10726.11s]  Okay.
[10727.39s -> 10732.32s]  Now I'm getting where you're coming from, guys.
[10733.92s -> 10735.52s]  Now I'm getting where you're coming from, guys.
[10736.75s -> 10737.87s]  Now I see what you're getting.
[10737.87s -> 10739.07s]  I see what you're talking about here.
[10740.49s -> 10741.77s]  I didn't see it before, now I do.
[10747.34s -> 10747.98s]  I get it now.
[10748.54s -> 10751.31s]  No, I didn't buy the digital deluxe.
[10751.31s -> 10752.27s]  Why would I ever do that?
[10759.12s -> 10759.68s]  No, I get...
[10759.68s -> 10760.32s]  I know what you mean.
[10763.98s -> 10764.54s]  I didn't...
[10764.54s -> 10764.94s]  For a sec...
[10764.94s -> 10767.02s]  Okay, I'm gonna line this up and get a collateral here.
[10769.32s -> 10770.75s]  Let's try to get like...
[10770.75s -> 10772.51s]  Let me try to get like four people in one shot.
[10773.39s -> 10788.00s]  Don't look over.
[10788.00s -> 10788.56s]  What the hell are you doing?
[10788.56s -> 10789.52s]  Go investigate the rock.
[10791.48s -> 10792.68s]  I want to line up like a quad.
[10793.40s -> 10802.76s]  You can't use any weapons.
[10807.66s -> 10808.22s]  Okay.
[10808.22s -> 10808.46s]  I...
[10817.18s -> 10818.94s]  I can't kill anyone.
[10818.94s -> 10820.38s]  I can't attack anyone.
[10820.38s -> 10821.42s]  Not even stealth kill.
[10822.06s -> 10822.54s]  I just...
[10834.22s -> 10834.94s]  Oh, no.
[10834.94s -> 10840.03s]  It's one of these fucking clothes goddamn.
[10850.88s -> 10851.20s]  All right.
[10851.20s -> 10851.52s]  All right.
[10851.52s -> 10851.84s]  Okay.
[10851.84s -> 10852.08s]  All right.
[10852.08s -> 10852.32s]  All right.
[10852.32s -> 10852.64s]  Listen.
[10852.64s -> 10852.96s]  All right.
[10852.96s -> 10853.84s]  Just everybody relax.
[10854.56s -> 10854.96s]  I know.
[10854.96s -> 10855.84s]  I understand.
[10855.84s -> 10856.48s]  Just hold on.
[10857.44s -> 10857.60s]  I...
[10859.20s -> 10860.40s]  I've seen the light.
[10860.40s -> 10861.12s]  I've seen it.
[10862.59s -> 10863.47s]  Yes, I can't even...
[10863.47s -> 10865.23s]  I thought it meant like melee attack.
[10865.23s -> 10866.19s]  But what is this shit?
[10867.50s -> 10868.86s]  Why would you show me that thumbnail
[10868.86s -> 10871.42s]  of a guy being stabbed in the neck for this mission?
[10873.07s -> 10873.55s]  What the...
[10873.55s -> 10874.03s]  Why?
[10874.03s -> 10875.07s]  I thought I saw the knife.
[10876.11s -> 10885.12s]  All right.
[10885.12s -> 10885.36s]  So...
[10885.36s -> 10886.40s]  Oh, man.
[10886.40s -> 10894.88s]  Is this hidden?
[10895.68s -> 10896.64s]  This counts as grass, right?
[10907.84s -> 10908.96s]  Are you getting hungry?
[10909.52s -> 10916.16s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10916.16s -> 10916.48s]  No.
[10916.48s -> 10917.12s]  Fucking dump.
[10924.00s -> 10925.84s]  My flashlight is on.
[10925.84s -> 10946.54s]  The hell am I doing?
[10946.54s -> 10947.42s]  Why am I reading this?
[10959.98s -> 10961.90s]  Where'd like the researcher go up there?
[10961.90s -> 10988.00s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[10988.00s -> 10988.64s]  In the helicopter?
[10988.64s -> 10991.93s]  Do I have to take the helicopter?
[10991.93s -> 10992.41s]  I don't know.
[10992.41s -> 10992.73s]  I don't know.
[10992.73s -> 10993.05s]  Just throw...
[10993.69s -> 10996.65s]  Do I have to go in the helicopter?
[11002.78s -> 11003.34s]  Where is he?
[11003.90s -> 11007.93s]  I don't...
[11007.93s -> 11009.13s]  I don't know where...
[11009.13s -> 11009.53s]  This way?
[11016.49s -> 11017.77s]  In the helicopter.
[11017.77s -> 11018.25s]  Are you sure?
[11018.97s -> 11019.77s]  I don't know if you're sure about that.
[11019.77s -> 11020.01s]  Hold on.
[11020.01s -> 11020.25s]  Wait.
[11026.11s -> 11026.35s]  One.
[11027.48s -> 11027.72s]  Two.
[11028.28s -> 11040.48s]  I'm luring him.
[11040.48s -> 11042.00s]  I'm luring him to me.
[11049.08s -> 11050.60s]  Anybody hear any sound?
[11050.60s -> 11051.08s]  Helicopter.
[11051.08s -> 11051.24s]  Go.
[11051.88s -> 11054.11s]  You guys lied.
[11078.73s -> 11080.41s]  Other side of the helicopter?
[11080.41s -> 11085.04s]  Oh, fuck.
[11085.04s -> 11097.68s]  I'm just waiting for it to be like...
[11098.32s -> 11117.40s]  I'm sorry.
[11117.40s -> 11117.88s]  Okay.
[11117.88s -> 11118.76s]  Well, I just tried.
[11128.41s -> 11129.13s]  Other side.
[11129.77s -> 11130.17s]  Stop.
[11130.81s -> 11144.73s]  It's not gonna...
[11144.73s -> 11145.77s]  There's no alarm in there.
[11147.69s -> 11148.73s]  It's at the back.
[11148.73s -> 11149.69s]  It's not at the back.
[11149.69s -> 11150.41s]  That's a tail.
[11151.71s -> 11154.19s]  I have to find the guy in the white suit.
[11156.72s -> 11157.20s]  It's this way.
[11157.20s -> 11157.76s]  You guys lied.
[11157.76s -> 11158.40s]  I have to just go this way.
[11158.40s -> 11158.80s]  Here we go.
[11158.80s -> 11158.96s]  One.
[11158.96s -> 11159.20s]  Two.
[11159.20s -> 11159.44s]  Three.
[11159.44s -> 11159.60s]  Go.
[11160.40s -> 11160.72s]  Wait.
[11161.52s -> 11182.30s]  Where'd the doctor go?
[11182.30s -> 11182.62s]  This way.
[11182.62s -> 11183.18s]  Somewhere, right?
[11183.82s -> 11185.02s]  Oh my god damn it.
[11185.74s -> 11192.44s]  If I swear to god, if I have to go to the tail...
[11195.85s -> 11196.89s]  Is it that guy right there?
[11210.52s -> 11211.48s]  Down that way.
[11211.48s -> 11216.30s]  There were people talking right next to the helicopter.
[11216.30s -> 11216.78s]  Yeah, that's...
[11216.78s -> 11220.17s]  I know, but I feel like...
[11220.17s -> 11221.29s]  Can I just go down that way?
[11222.01s -> 11229.28s]  Please stay low.
[11229.28s -> 11229.68s]  Stay low.
[11229.68s -> 11230.16s]  Stay low.
[11230.16s -> 11230.80s]  Okay, stay low.
[11230.80s -> 11231.52s]  What are you talking about?
[11231.52s -> 11231.84s]  I am.
[11240.01s -> 11240.49s]  Do I...
[11240.49s -> 11241.45s]  I feel like I have to...
[11241.45s -> 11242.09s]  Hold on.
[11242.09s -> 11245.31s]  Let me see if everyone's lying to me.
[11246.11s -> 11264.59s]  You have to enter the helicopter from the top.
[11265.15s -> 11266.27s]  It's not the helicopter.
[11268.70s -> 11270.86s]  They went uphill on that west side.
[11270.86s -> 11272.70s]  Yeah, like up here, right?
[11273.58s -> 11275.23s]  Hold on.
[11275.23s -> 11278.92s]  Up like this way?
[11279.72s -> 11280.28s]  No, that's right.
[11285.21s -> 11286.17s]  West, not north.
[11290.12s -> 11290.76s]  Okay, I'm gonna go...
[11302.60s -> 11303.56s]  Just go west.
[11303.56s -> 11304.36s]  I'm just gonna go west.
[11304.36s -> 11305.96s]  I'm just gonna be tactical about this and just go...
[11319.50s -> 11319.66s]  What?
[11319.66s -> 11320.46s]  We need something to move.
[11321.79s -> 11322.59s]  Hide this bunch quick!
[11351.07s -> 11351.31s]  Up here.
[11355.71s -> 11357.15s]  Go north-south.
[11357.71s -> 11362.28s]  And god damn force stealth game.
[11362.84s -> 11365.24s]  Oh, there is nothing worse.
[11367.26s -> 11367.66s]  I'm gonna...
[11369.18s -> 11376.73s]  I gotta send them that way.
[11378.06s -> 11379.34s]  You, like, go over there.
[11416.22s -> 11417.66s]  I was going the right way.
[11417.66s -> 11418.30s]  I was.
[11418.30s -> 11419.74s]  Everybody just got in my head.
[11419.74s -> 11421.10s]  I was going the right way.
[11421.10s -> 11422.86s]  I was going past the helicopter.
[11423.60s -> 11425.28s]  I was doing it correct.
[11425.28s -> 11428.72s]  And everyone says, no, you're doing it wrong.
[11428.72s -> 11429.44s]  I was going...
[11429.44s -> 11430.40s]  And then we're at all...
[11430.40s -> 11432.48s]  I went all the way back around the circle.
[11432.48s -> 11433.52s]  It's over here.
[11435.34s -> 11436.14s]  It's up there.
[11453.37s -> 11455.90s]  Please don't turn around!
[11455.90s -> 11457.82s]  Don't turn around!
[11457.82s -> 11459.00s]  I made it.
[11459.00s -> 11460.20s]  Okay, now it's up here.
[11460.20s -> 11460.92s]  They went this way.
[11464.04s -> 11464.52s]  Oh!
[11481.84s -> 11482.96s]  Get the fuck out of here!
[11482.96s -> 11484.08s]  Leave me alone!
[11484.08s -> 11488.75s]  They went right here.
[11488.75s -> 11498.04s]  Oh my god!
[11498.04s -> 11499.08s]  Where do I go?
[11499.88s -> 11500.20s]  No!
[11500.84s -> 11501.16s]  What?
[11504.44s -> 11504.76s]  I...
[11504.76s -> 11505.64s]  There's nobody here.
[11510.97s -> 11512.33s]  Where is this guy?
[11520.36s -> 11522.60s]  I already went to the helicopter, like, three times.
[11523.32s -> 11528.65s]  Is it over...
[11528.65s -> 11529.85s]  There's a car over here.
[11529.85s -> 11530.49s]  Is it this way?
[11531.21s -> 11533.23s]  I think I was supposed to be tailing somebody.
[11535.16s -> 11537.32s]  Oh my god!
[11540.43s -> 11541.87s]  This fucking cave!
[11543.12s -> 11544.32s]  No, there's no cave!
[11544.96s -> 11554.65s]  I'm one of those who'll fucking distract you.
[11556.38s -> 11557.10s]  In the water?
[11558.89s -> 11559.93s]  Like, down there?
[11562.84s -> 11563.64s]  I went over there.
[11563.64s -> 11564.28s]  It was nothing.
[11565.44s -> 11567.20s]  Is it like a little spot I can go in here?
[11570.01s -> 11570.73s]  Okay, hold on.
[11572.56s -> 11573.84s]  But this just goes back up!
[11574.64s -> 11579.18s]  Somebody open up a goddamn game, Janie.
[11604.51s -> 11605.95s]  The map has a quest point.
[11614.16s -> 11614.80s]  But what?
[11615.68s -> 11615.92s]  No.
[11617.48s -> 11619.40s]  This is out of the mission zone!
[11619.40s -> 11620.68s]  This is out of bounds!
[11623.18s -> 11625.42s]  The mission ends if I walk out here!
[11625.42s -> 11639.92s]  Hold on.
[11639.92s -> 11641.76s]  For start the mission, don't throw any rocks.
[11641.76s -> 11643.68s]  Just follow the guy in the white suit.
[11643.68s -> 11662.06s]  I just follow the guy in the white suit.
[11663.18s -> 11663.66s]  Quit the game.
[11663.66s -> 11664.46s]  No, no, no.
[11664.46s -> 11665.98s]  I can't let it be me.
[11665.98s -> 11666.86s]  I have to win.
[11666.86s -> 11673.50s]  Throw rocks at the guy with the suit.
[11673.50s -> 11676.70s]  All right, where...
[11676.70s -> 11677.34s]  Hold on, wait, wait.
[11677.34s -> 11678.06s]  But where...
[11678.06s -> 11679.66s]  Where's the guy in the suit?
[11680.54s -> 11681.58s]  It keeps spawning me.
[11681.58s -> 11682.78s]  It's soft locking me here.
[11684.96s -> 11686.00s]  Where is this person?
[11699.58s -> 11701.02s]  The whole game is gray.
[11701.02s -> 11702.14s]  I can't see anything.
[11714.83s -> 11715.55s]  Go west?
[11716.35s -> 11717.71s]  Like, that's...
[11718.83s -> 11719.79s]  Okay, here I go.
[11720.43s -> 11729.21s]  This is gonna lead back up to the spawn.
[11734.14s -> 11735.42s]  Up the hill with the fence.
[11735.42s -> 11737.18s]  No, that's bullshit because look!
[11737.82s -> 11739.26s]  This is the start of the game!
[11745.84s -> 11747.52s]  This is the beginning of the game!
[11792.48s -> 11793.36s]  Go north.
[11793.36s -> 11794.08s]  Go north.
[11794.08s -> 11796.64s]  You went everywhere but the right direction.
[11796.64s -> 11799.60s]  Why do I have to follow the straight line path
[11799.60s -> 11801.76s]  in an open world game?
[11801.76s -> 11808.52s]  I can go left from here.
[11812.67s -> 11813.55s]  The other fence.
[11818.72s -> 11819.20s]  Look...
[11819.20s -> 11820.64s]  I mean, like, you're talking about over here.
[11820.64s -> 11822.08s]  Let me get the fucking binoculars here.
[11822.08s -> 11823.36s]  Like, he marked this guy.
[11824.16s -> 11826.33s]  Like, you're talking about this way.
[11826.89s -> 11833.00s]  What do you mean the other left?
[11833.00s -> 11833.72s]  This is left!
[11837.10s -> 11837.50s]  This way.
[11837.50s -> 11839.42s]  Like, just go straight this way.
[11839.42s -> 11841.50s]  Okay, where that little pixel is pointing
[11841.50s -> 11842.78s]  is where you want me to go, right?
[11849.34s -> 11850.62s]  All right, okay, hold on, wait.
[11850.62s -> 11852.46s]  I'm looking at the helicopter right now.
[11852.46s -> 11854.14s]  To the left of this helicopter
[11854.14s -> 11856.06s]  or to the right of this helicopter?
[11861.18s -> 11862.46s]  Hard left.
[11862.46s -> 11864.03s]  So this way.
[11866.65s -> 11867.13s]  I don't know.
[11867.85s -> 11869.77s]  Yes, no, left, the back.
[11869.77s -> 11870.97s]  Left, left of the back.
[11871.77s -> 11873.68s]  There's a cave right next to you.
[11874.48s -> 11878.04s]  Where is there a cave?
[11879.08s -> 11880.04s]  There's a cave.
[11881.08s -> 11882.44s]  Wait, the cave.
[11882.44s -> 11883.56s]  I don't see a cave.
[11888.28s -> 11889.00s]  I'm going for the...
[11889.00s -> 11889.64s]  I'm going this way.
[11889.64s -> 11890.44s]  Everyone said this way.
[11890.44s -> 11890.92s]  Hard left.
[11891.56s -> 11907.29s]  Give me, give me, give me!
[11907.29s -> 11911.63s]  There's nobody in here!
[11912.19s -> 11916.56s]  There's nobody inside the cave!
[11917.44s -> 11929.85s]  There is!
[11929.85s -> 11930.49s]  There's a scientist!
[11934.49s -> 11936.01s]  Going too far from the researchers!
[11936.01s -> 11936.97s]  What are you talking about?
[11941.24s -> 11941.80s]  He's from...
[11944.32s -> 11948.80s]  I've been...
[11949.68s -> 11951.60s]  I've been far away from the researchers.
[11966.20s -> 11970.84s]  Be careful!
[11979.72s -> 11981.64s]  Wait, now it wants me to clear the camp?
[11982.60s -> 11983.56s]  I have to sit here and listen.
[12004.24s -> 12011.92s]  No, stop it.
[12011.92s -> 12012.48s]  Just let it in.
[12025.77s -> 12031.53s]  I spent a whole day on this mission.
[12031.53s -> 12032.25s]  A whole day going...
[12036.03s -> 12038.35s]  Follow the researcher to continue eavesdropping.
[12038.91s -> 12040.35s]  Stay close and out of sight.
[12040.35s -> 12041.31s]  Oh, come on!
[12048.54s -> 12049.98s]  I really don't think anyone,
[12051.04s -> 12052.24s]  and I mean anyone,
[12052.80s -> 12054.80s]  that has ever played a video game
[12054.80s -> 12056.88s]  in their whole life thinks that...
[12056.88s -> 12057.38s]  No!
[12059.04s -> 12060.16s]  Thinks this is fun!
[12067.92s -> 12068.72s]  Following...
[12068.72s -> 12071.28s]  Forced stealth follow and listen to somebody talk.
[12072.16s -> 12073.12s]  Nobody thinks...
[12073.12s -> 12074.00s]  I don't want to listen to this!
[12080.49s -> 12083.21s]  We have like decades of video game research
[12083.21s -> 12083.69s]  and knowledge.
[12086.52s -> 12087.72s]  They made whole games...
[12088.44s -> 12089.88s]  Some of the Assassin's Creed games
[12089.88s -> 12091.64s]  were this mission's the whole game.
[12091.64s -> 12092.28s]  And everyone was like,
[12092.28s -> 12093.40s]  all right, I'm going to go to the escort,
[12093.40s -> 12094.76s]  walk behind them and listen to the mission.
[12121.29s -> 12122.65s]  Now, I can stomach this,
[12122.65s -> 12123.61s]  but I can't...
[12124.41s -> 12125.61s]  They have to have forced stealth
[12125.61s -> 12127.68s]  because you have to listen to this.
[12127.68s -> 12129.68s]  You can't just throw an axe at somebody's head.
[12131.84s -> 12132.80s]  We have to hear this!
[12142.59s -> 12143.63s]  We got to go right here.
[12157.80s -> 12159.96s]  Dude, I'm going to throw a rock as hard as I can
[12159.96s -> 12160.76s]  to make sure it's in space.
[12171.56s -> 12172.36s]  Quit, quit, no!
[12174.91s -> 12175.47s]  No quitting!
[12179.34s -> 12180.54s]  Hurry up, go back to DOS.
[12187.56s -> 12188.52s]  No, he's not seeing me.
[12192.60s -> 12193.80s]  That light is really close.
[12193.80s -> 12194.60s]  Please don't see me.
[12196.04s -> 12197.16s]  Okay, return to your bike.
[12197.16s -> 12198.20s]  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[12198.20s -> 12199.00s]  Get me to buy a bike.
[12202.30s -> 12203.66s]  What's the fastest way to get over there?
[12203.66s -> 12204.54s]  I didn't mark anybody.
[12207.93s -> 12208.89s]  Um, shit.
[12210.49s -> 12211.69s]  No, con!
[12211.69s -> 12212.19s]  Con!
[12213.29s -> 12214.49s]  Why is this guy just here?
[12218.75s -> 12220.11s]  Don't make me do it all again.
[12220.91s -> 12223.56s]  Don't make me do it again.
[12226.43s -> 12226.91s]  Thank you.
[12227.71s -> 12239.28s]  You saw that.
[12243.79s -> 12244.83s]  You saw me do it.
[12263.48s -> 12270.00s]  Give me back my bike.
[12270.72s -> 12272.25s]  Give me back to the bike.
[12273.56s -> 12274.06s]  Oops!
[12281.55s -> 12282.05s]  Oh no.
[12297.13s -> 12308.35s]  Okay, come on.
[12308.35s -> 12309.47s]  Give me to the bike.
[12309.47s -> 12316.06s]  No, he's going to come over here too, isn't he?
[12318.08s -> 12320.08s]  You stay all the fucking way over there.
[12320.08s -> 12320.72s]  For God's sakes.
[12327.15s -> 12328.11s]  Thank God, get me out.
[12334.94s -> 12338.25s]  Oh my God, it only took like 40 minutes.
[12338.25s -> 12339.37s]  Holy shit.
[12339.37s -> 12358.11s]  You better switch to a better game or no dessert for you.
[12358.99s -> 12364.28s]  Oh, fuck all the quitters.
[12365.00s -> 12365.88s]  All right, you know what?
[12365.88s -> 12372.00s]  That one guy, you're right.
[12372.00s -> 12372.88s]  Why is he still playing?
[12372.88s -> 12373.76s]  He admitted it's not.
[12373.76s -> 12375.04s]  I never said it wasn't fun.
[12375.04s -> 12377.44s]  I just said why would they do missions like this?
[12378.08s -> 12382.06s]  Unlocked.
[12382.06s -> 12383.26s]  Crafting recipe.
[12383.26s -> 12384.14s]  Residue bolt.
[12384.86s -> 12386.59s]  All right, get me out of here.
[12388.80s -> 12389.60s]  Turn on each other.
[12389.60s -> 12390.10s]  Cool.
[12390.72s -> 12392.48s]  All right, let's go back in the game.
[12392.48s -> 12393.68s]  I got to deliver my...
[12394.64s -> 12395.44s]  I got to deliver this.
[12396.32s -> 12397.61s]  New skill.
[12397.61s -> 12398.57s]  Finally, we got a skill point.
[12398.57s -> 12399.13s]  Check this out.
[12400.19s -> 12401.31s]  Probably didn't even think it was...
[12401.31s -> 12402.03s]  You're going to see this.
[12402.67s -> 12414.48s]  Ability to activate focused aim.
[12416.32s -> 12418.40s]  Move and aim a ranged weapon with more precision.
[12419.12s -> 12422.32s]  Ability to follow a melee attack with a ranged attack for massive damage.
[12423.04s -> 12426.17s]  Increase the time that icons display in survival vision.
[12427.39s -> 12428.83s]  Plants are displayed on the minimap.
[12429.39s -> 12431.50s]  Provides a chance to retrieve some bolts that have been...
[12440.78s -> 12444.83s]  I mean, I guess this one.
[12445.39s -> 12445.79s]  Oh yeah.
[12447.92s -> 12448.32s]  This one.
[12458.78s -> 12459.58s]  It's sponsored.
[12459.58s -> 12461.18s]  This is not a sponsored stream.
[12461.18s -> 12461.66s]  I would have...
[12461.66s -> 12463.26s]  My contract would have been ripped in half.
[12465.69s -> 12466.19s]  Sarah.
[12467.52s -> 12471.04s]  That phone call in the beginning of the stream would have been from the sponsor.
[12471.76s -> 12478.12s]  We're just calling to let you know that the contract's terminated.
[12478.92s -> 12481.24s]  You said, fuck this dumb stealth mission.
[12481.24s -> 12482.44s]  And you laughed at something.
[12483.00s -> 12483.50s]  Hello.
[12513.66s -> 12517.42s]  You should play Photoshop.
[12517.42s -> 12519.18s]  What do you mean Photoshop?
[12520.06s -> 12524.09s]  I don't know how to use Photoshop that well.
[12539.90s -> 12541.18s]  He doesn't come off the bike.
[12542.99s -> 12544.51s]  Fuck you, buddy.
[12544.51s -> 12545.63s]  I got something for you.
[12546.76s -> 12547.40s]  Smile!
[12550.11s -> 12550.61s]  No!
[12550.99s -> 12551.49s]  Please!
[12558.27s -> 12559.39s]  Do not Bioshock!
[12559.95s -> 12586.52s]  We're good.
[12586.52s -> 12587.40s]  Microsoft Office.
[12587.40s -> 12588.44s]  I'm always just writing paper.
[12593.10s -> 12594.06s]  No, come on.
[12597.85s -> 12599.21s]  Come on, just give it a chance.
[12599.93s -> 12602.04s]  Clear?
[12602.04s -> 12602.84s]  Is there a hostage?
[12603.56s -> 12610.90s]  Okay.
[12620.52s -> 12621.02s]  No!
[12621.96s -> 12631.00s]  I can't do it.
[12631.00s -> 12631.48s]  I can't.
[12631.48s -> 12632.20s]  It doesn't work.
[12639.39s -> 12640.19s]  What the hell?
[12640.19s -> 12641.79s]  No, I want you to throw the pipe bomb.
[12645.05s -> 12645.55s]  Great.
[12654.86s -> 12656.14s]  No, I can't quit.
[12656.14s -> 12656.78s]  I can't quit.
[12656.78s -> 12658.30s]  We have like three and a half hours in.
[12658.30s -> 12659.10s]  Come on.
[12659.10s -> 12662.38s]  This stream's only going to be like another three hours long.
[12662.38s -> 12663.26s]  Four hours.
[12663.26s -> 12664.94s]  We got to stick with this.
[12664.94s -> 12674.38s]  It's the only time you're ever going to see this game.
[12674.94s -> 12677.18s]  Don't you want to know if you want to buy it?
[12678.06s -> 12680.30s]  I went right through that log.
[12680.94s -> 12681.44s]  Shit.
[12682.30s -> 12693.50s]  I already know.
[12693.50s -> 12694.54s]  I already know.
[12694.54s -> 12695.02s]  Do you though?
[12695.02s -> 12696.94s]  But what if like something happens and you go,
[12696.94s -> 12698.70s]  oh shit, that sounds like fun.
[12709.93s -> 12711.45s]  Yeah, let me just...
[12711.45s -> 12712.41s]  This is what we're doing.
[12712.41s -> 12712.89s]  Don't worry.
[12712.89s -> 12713.85s]  I'll be live tomorrow.
[12713.85s -> 12716.33s]  If you don't want to see it then it's all good.
[12716.33s -> 12717.45s]  We're just having fun.
[12718.09s -> 12730.03s]  What is on the other side?
[12732.00s -> 12733.20s]  I'm having a fun time.
[12733.84s -> 12734.70s]  I'm doing fine.
[12734.70s -> 12735.58s]  I'm having fun.
[12735.58s -> 12736.86s]  Raider camp.
[12736.86s -> 12738.94s]  What you mean sons of bitches, aren't you?
[12739.90s -> 12740.86s]  As you said this week.
[12741.82s -> 12744.64s]  I mean guys, I'm being real.
[12744.64s -> 12745.36s]  It's either this...
[12746.08s -> 12746.58s]  Or...
[12749.84s -> 12751.12s]  No, I can't even say that.
[12751.68s -> 12753.84s]  Because we're doing that on Sunday.
[12762.11s -> 12762.75s]  Or what?
[12762.75s -> 12763.87s]  Say it to everyone.
[12763.87s -> 12764.59s]  It's freaking out.
[12765.23s -> 12767.95s]  I was going to say Mario Yahtzee, but that's...
[12768.83s -> 12770.48s]  Shouldn't have said it.
[12783.53s -> 12784.25s]  Don't quit.
[12784.25s -> 12786.81s]  No, we'll play Mario Yahtzee on Sunday.
[12788.32s -> 12789.92s]  Well, like, let me...
[12789.92s -> 12790.72s]  Hold on, let me like...
[12791.68s -> 12799.66s]  Move the car.
[12800.30s -> 12805.69s]  Finally, some decent food.
[12810.46s -> 12812.22s]  One guy said don't quit.
[12812.22s -> 12812.72s]  That's true.
[12813.42s -> 12815.85s]  And plus this was what I wanted to do today.
[12816.89s -> 12817.85s]  Look, I'll think about it, okay?
[12817.85s -> 12818.65s]  Here's what's going to happen.
[12819.29s -> 12821.39s]  We're going to play this a little bit more.
[12821.39s -> 12822.27s]  And I'm going to go pee.
[12822.91s -> 12823.71s]  It's three and a half hours.
[12823.71s -> 12824.27s]  I haven't peed yet.
[12824.27s -> 12825.31s]  It's a world record.
[12832.75s -> 12833.39s]  Nobody said that?
[12833.39s -> 12833.95s]  Yes, they did.
[12833.95s -> 12834.51s]  Scroll back.
[12835.40s -> 12837.40s]  Just go up on your mouse.
[12849.08s -> 12850.28s]  Drive five feet.
[12850.28s -> 12851.08s]  Move another car.
[12858.11s -> 12860.43s]  Line it up, line it up, line it up, line it up.
[12860.43s -> 12860.83s]  Fuck!
[12860.83s -> 12861.79s]  I had it too.
[12861.79s -> 12862.29s]  Oh!
[12862.99s -> 12863.87s]  I'm angry about that.
[12876.92s -> 12877.56s]  What?
[12877.56s -> 12881.56s]  All right, bye.
[12882.52s -> 12882.92s]  I guess.
[12884.78s -> 12885.34s]  Pee stream?
[12885.34s -> 12886.54s]  Oh, you're going to get a pee here.
[12886.54s -> 12887.90s]  No, not on stream, but I'm going to go.
[12891.10s -> 12892.46s]  No, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.
[12898.01s -> 12899.05s]  Can I not move this car?
[12899.69s -> 12902.68s]  I can't move this car.
[12903.32s -> 12904.28s]  No, that's not true.
[12904.92s -> 12916.80s]  I can't move this car.
[12916.80s -> 12918.48s]  No, I definitely can.
[12919.12s -> 12920.67s]  I was going to say no.
[12920.67s -> 12921.87s]  Obstructed five bike.
[12924.22s -> 12925.26s]  No shit, huh?
[12926.06s -> 12937.07s]  At least let us play with smart click.
[12937.79s -> 12942.46s]  I'll think about it after I pee.
[12962.56s -> 12963.60s]  Think faster.
[12964.24s -> 12975.74s]  Okay, if there's another roadblock, I'm going to quit again.
[12980.14s -> 12982.01s]  Good, good.
[12986.83s -> 12987.87s]  I'm out of gas.
[12988.59s -> 12997.24s]  No roadblock.
[12997.24s -> 12997.96s]  We get to stay.
[13002.28s -> 13003.80s]  Let me at least turn this shit in.
[13013.40s -> 13013.72s]  Gas?
[13032.33s -> 13034.40s]  Camp was wiped out.
[13034.40s -> 13035.84s]  No, I know that, but I heard.
[13035.84s -> 13036.24s]  Okay, look.
[13039.16s -> 13040.12s]  What's what are you doing?
[13042.06s -> 13042.86s]  Why is it doing that?
[13044.46s -> 13047.24s]  Wait, wait, you're into their LZ?
[13047.24s -> 13047.72s]  What the?
[13047.72s -> 13050.20s]  Just listen.
[13050.20s -> 13054.75s]  How do I call the bike?
[13054.75s -> 13055.23s]  Recover.
[13056.03s -> 13057.55s]  Bike is too far to recover.
[13065.55s -> 13066.75s]  Oh, we're losing internet here.
[13068.54s -> 13071.05s]  Hey, get some sleep.
[13071.61s -> 13072.25s]  D, get out.
[13072.81s -> 13084.76s]  This is Radio Free Oregon.
[13085.64s -> 13086.28s]  Walking.
[13089.96s -> 13091.56s]  Check the nerd camp for fuel.
[13093.96s -> 13094.84s]  It's too far now.
[13097.52s -> 13098.08s]  It's too far.
[13108.16s -> 13109.36s]  Look at the gas back there.
[13111.80s -> 13112.92s]  Just turn around, I can coast.
[13115.42s -> 13117.42s]  Uh-oh, boring, boring, boring streamer.
[13118.06s -> 13120.04s]  No, just wait, wait, just wait.
[13120.52s -> 13121.16s]  Something funny could happen.
[13121.16s -> 13121.64s]  Right here, ready?
[13135.64s -> 13138.36s]  Oh shit, not even the funny music will make them laugh.
[13157.32s -> 13157.96s]  What?
[13157.96s -> 13159.07s]  I just want gas.
[13159.07s -> 13160.27s]  I don't care about anything else here.
[13162.68s -> 13168.35s]  One of these days I'm going to need to turn the stream on during this.
[13168.99s -> 13170.43s]  And I'm just going to be making balloon animals.
[13171.15s -> 13172.94s]  Hey, the game sucks.
[13172.94s -> 13173.58s]  Like boring.
[13173.58s -> 13174.46s]  Come on, play something else.
[13174.46s -> 13175.66s]  Oh shit, I'm going to turn the camera on.
[13175.66s -> 13177.98s]  Just start making fucking dogs and stuff.
[13184.38s -> 13185.74s]  Find the fuse.
[13186.62s -> 13190.04s]  I just want gas.
[13190.76s -> 13198.00s]  I don't even know how to make balloon animals.
[13198.56s -> 13201.07s]  Thank God.
[13202.06s -> 13203.02s]  All right, the stream can go on.
[13205.98s -> 13207.42s]  It's right there, just give it to me.
[13207.42s -> 13210.28s]  It's right there, just give it to me.
[13213.56s -> 13214.52s]  I can see it.
[13214.52s -> 13215.16s]  It's right here.
[13215.72s -> 13216.60s]  That's gas, right?
[13219.31s -> 13221.15s]  That's gas, gasoline.
[13221.15s -> 13221.71s]  I'll take it.
[13222.27s -> 13236.36s]  You guys actually have pretty good patience.
[13236.36s -> 13237.40s]  I will give you that.
[13241.26s -> 13242.38s]  We're going for about four hours.
[13243.02s -> 13243.98s]  But it's been fun.
[13244.54s -> 13246.14s]  You guys are really patient.
[13248.96s -> 13249.44s]  What do you mean?
[13249.44s -> 13249.76s]  How?
[13249.76s -> 13250.56s]  How are they patient?
[13250.56s -> 13251.12s]  No, we're not.
[13251.12s -> 13251.68s]  No, we don't.
[13252.24s -> 13254.09s]  I'm trying to give you a compliment.
[13254.09s -> 13254.57s]  Now my turn.
[13254.57s -> 13254.97s]  Give me one.
[13254.97s -> 13255.45s]  What do you think?
[13258.33s -> 13259.55s]  Your turn.
[13261.95s -> 13273.74s]  Your infestation zone.
[13283.69s -> 13284.17s]  Jump!
[13284.17s -> 13285.05s]  A cool jump.
[13300.67s -> 13302.19s]  How did you get down here?
[13334.59s -> 13335.31s]  God damn it.
[13336.03s -> 13338.83s]  My frame rate dropped to like 20 frames a second.
[13338.83s -> 13339.95s]  I didn't make the jump.
[13339.95s -> 13342.76s]  Okay, I'm holding right trigger right now.
[13344.12s -> 13345.32s]  If I don't make it this time.
[13346.49s -> 13347.45s]  See this like slow down.
[13347.45s -> 13349.29s]  Is it not catching my frames or something?
[13349.29s -> 13350.49s]  No, I'm going to make it this time.
[13351.69s -> 13352.25s]  Why would?
[13352.81s -> 13353.05s]  Why?
[13356.92s -> 13357.80s]  No way.
[13369.52s -> 13371.44s]  You tell me I can't make that jump.
[13371.44s -> 13373.04s]  It's like 15 feet.
[13373.04s -> 13374.48s]  It's not even 10 feet.
[13374.48s -> 13375.52s]  I'm hitting that jump.
[13377.34s -> 13378.14s]  I'll show you how.
[13379.85s -> 13381.37s]  You think I give a fuck right now?
[13381.37s -> 13383.13s]  We're hitting that jump and I'm going over it.
[13383.77s -> 13397.84s]  This nesting zone.
[13408.67s -> 13409.15s]  Get it.
[13409.71s -> 13411.56s]  Oh, a freakery infestation.
[13411.56s -> 13412.84s]  Did you know that the freakery infestation
[13412.84s -> 13415.16s]  are highly dangerous areas where freakers can congregate
[13415.16s -> 13416.92s]  to build their nest to hibernate during the day?
[13416.92s -> 13418.44s]  Clear all nests to be careful about that.
[13418.44s -> 13420.52s]  By the way, if you need anything else, just let me know.
[13420.52s -> 13422.19s]  I smell a nest.
[13422.83s -> 13439.37s]  Oh, I got a freakers way to check these houses, man.
[13482.91s -> 13485.63s]  Grab me and then I got his eyes out.
[13489.95s -> 13492.72s]  All right, supplies.
[13492.72s -> 13497.23s]  We're looking for ammo, snacks, bandages,
[13498.80s -> 13500.16s]  anything of that sort, guys.
[13500.16s -> 13501.84s]  If you see anything, make sure you holler at me.
[13509.37s -> 13511.37s]  And if you see anything in the comments below,
[13511.37s -> 13515.85s]  let me know if you find if you see something.
[13515.85s -> 13518.01s]  So yeah, guys, I was just chilling the other day
[13518.01s -> 13519.93s]  and I went to the ice cream store
[13520.73s -> 13523.53s]  and I got a chocolate ice cream and I really liked it.
[13524.09s -> 13524.89s]  What's your favorite ice cream?
[13524.89s -> 13526.49s]  Let me know in the comments while I game engagements.
[13528.44s -> 13529.64s]  Oh, okay, let's start the video now.
[13529.64s -> 13531.16s]  So hey, welcome to another video.
[13533.90s -> 13551.13s]  Where's the, where's my bike?
[13551.13s -> 13552.09s]  Oh, what?
[13552.09s -> 13553.93s]  I still have this stupid kidney here.
[13558.35s -> 13560.03s]  Your old videos were that exactly.
[13561.07s -> 13563.47s]  I'm not able to look back and say I've grown.
[13570.19s -> 13570.91s]  All right, that was weird
[13571.55s -> 13574.11s]  because right when the internet died, this popped up.
[13574.11s -> 13582.27s]  The second the internet tanked, I got like,
[13582.27s -> 13583.87s]  hey, make sure you just grab on your bike.
[13587.56s -> 13589.00s]  What the fuck was that?
[13591.77s -> 13592.89s]  What is happening?
[13597.12s -> 13598.24s]  I don't know.
[13598.24s -> 13599.04s]  Get off of me.
[13602.27s -> 13603.31s]  Get your eyes out.
[13611.23s -> 13613.07s]  Why did I fly off the bike?
[13613.63s -> 13628.40s]  I got clothes lined.
[13629.04s -> 13631.44s]  Oh, I could repair the engine.
[13631.44s -> 13632.32s]  This thing's fucked.
[13647.39s -> 13650.54s]  Get on, get on.
[13650.54s -> 13653.95s]  Drive the location price on your head.
[13654.75s -> 13658.59s]  It was a trip wire.
[13658.59s -> 13659.63s]  Oh, that's pretty clever.
[13660.11s -> 13670.99s]  It is fucked, dude.
[13670.99s -> 13671.47s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[13672.51s -> 13674.33s]  I pulled over though when I fixed it.
[13675.13s -> 13685.05s]  It's like a dirt bike path
[13685.61s -> 13689.13s]  that I'm riding with a giant Harley motorcycle.
[13691.21s -> 13692.57s]  Well, what the hell?
[13693.29s -> 13694.89s]  That's worth checking out.
[13695.53s -> 13699.08s]  There's just a fight here?
[13699.08s -> 13699.72s]  Who's fighting?
[13700.44s -> 13714.01s]  Will these guys be my friends?
[13715.53s -> 13722.33s]  I wonder if like, are these guys friendly?
[13723.13s -> 13725.88s]  All right, let's fight them together.
[13733.77s -> 13734.73s]  There you go.
[13734.73s -> 13735.21s]  Nice work.
[13738.06s -> 13739.34s]  You and me are now a team.
[13767.53s -> 13769.05s]  I think that was his fault.
[13769.69s -> 13771.21s]  He dove into my bike.
[13772.01s -> 13781.53s]  Three pointer.
[13782.25s -> 13783.36s]  Did he?
[13783.36s -> 13784.48s]  Wait, did he turn into?
[13784.48s -> 13784.96s]  I don't know.
[13792.09s -> 13793.29s]  Where do these people come from?
[13793.93s -> 13796.44s]  I wonder, there's this thing on the mini map.
[13796.44s -> 13797.00s]  I want to read it.
[13797.88s -> 13801.26s]  What does this say?
[13801.90s -> 13806.49s]  Three finger jack viewpoint.
[13806.49s -> 13807.45s]  Old hot fingers.
[13808.17s -> 13820.19s]  There's another person up there.
[13821.28s -> 13821.84s]  Who is that?
[13835.52s -> 13837.36s]  All right, I'm getting the fuck out of this.
[13838.08s -> 13839.82s]  Give me my bike.
[13841.76s -> 13843.76s]  My guy landed on the crown of his head.
[13845.37s -> 13846.41s]  Oh my God.
[13846.41s -> 13847.37s]  Get away from me.
[13852.32s -> 13852.96s]  I died.
[13857.42s -> 13858.78s]  Now, now you die.
[13859.42s -> 13870.27s]  Stay down.
[13871.74s -> 13875.40s]  Okay, I'm going to go look up here.
[13877.39s -> 13878.67s]  Because this stuff up here,
[13878.67s -> 13880.19s]  people were up here hanging out.
[13880.75s -> 13881.87s]  So what was even up here?
[13887.10s -> 13887.50s]  Nothing?
[13888.46s -> 13889.02s]  Nothing at all.
[13889.66s -> 13891.28s]  Why was that guy standing up here?
[13893.24s -> 13894.04s]  All right, I'm out.
[13894.04s -> 13894.44s]  Let's go.
[13895.24s -> 13896.97s]  We're not almost there.
[13896.97s -> 13897.53s]  We're close.
[13905.53s -> 13906.01s]  Shut the hell up.
[13907.05s -> 13910.54s]  I was supposed to save the guy.
[13910.54s -> 13912.06s]  Well, I mean, he just walked off a cliff.
[13912.70s -> 13916.03s]  I would love to pick those up.
[13917.88s -> 13920.60s]  Yes, this is exclusive to PS4.
[13920.60s -> 13922.92s]  We cannot get this anywhere else.
[13922.92s -> 13924.76s]  And speaking of cannot do anything else,
[13925.40s -> 13926.68s]  I don't think I can go anywhere else.
[13926.68s -> 13927.56s]  Maybe I can go this way.
[13928.36s -> 13936.35s]  Can I go over this?
[13937.39s -> 13937.95s]  No.
[13937.95s -> 13941.58s]  It's like maybe a jump or something.
[13944.52s -> 13945.96s]  All right, well, I have to go this way.
[13946.68s -> 13948.17s]  I have to do it the right way.
[13948.81s -> 13959.55s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[13959.63s -> 13960.43s]  Deer crossing.
[13966.40s -> 13966.80s]  No, I don't.
[13967.76s -> 13971.12s]  Can you do a wheelie?
[13971.12s -> 13972.56s]  I don't think you can.
[13973.44s -> 13974.40s]  Not that I've been able to do.
[13983.90s -> 13984.22s]  Cave.
[13989.69s -> 13990.65s]  Oh, it's not a cave.
[13990.65s -> 13991.45s]  Shit.
[13991.45s -> 14004.38s]  I can't go over this, I don't think.
[14005.90s -> 14007.02s]  I can't go over that.
[14007.02s -> 14008.94s]  I can't just break through that and fly off.
[14009.90s -> 14011.12s]  God, that would be so cool.
[14011.12s -> 14011.60s]  Wouldn't it?
[14011.60s -> 14013.60s]  How cool would that be if I could just fly over that?
[14014.32s -> 14015.50s]  I'd be like...
[14023.50s -> 14024.14s]  It'd be cool.
[14024.14s -> 14024.78s]  It would be cool.
[14025.50s -> 14032.16s]  There's no way for me to jump over that.
[14032.88s -> 14039.77s]  I'm going the wrong way, but can I not wrap...
[14039.77s -> 14040.49s]  No, it's a tunnel.
[14040.49s -> 14041.05s]  Turn around.
[14041.05s -> 14042.09s]  I'm not doing another tunnel.
[14042.97s -> 14045.45s]  I'm not getting off the bike three times to push cars.
[14046.01s -> 14047.13s]  We're just gonna go this way then.
[14047.85s -> 14063.31s]  I feel like the bike doesn't go that fast either.
[14064.59s -> 14065.15s]  Perfect.
[14065.95s -> 14066.75s]  Just perfect.
[14067.71s -> 14071.61s]  You know when you play GTA with your friends in multiplayer
[14074.17s -> 14076.57s]  and they do this thing where they cover the whole street in cars
[14076.57s -> 14078.25s]  to try to block the road and fuck everybody?
[14081.84s -> 14082.88s]  Why did somebody do this?
[14083.44s -> 14098.43s]  Because, you know, what about blocking the zombies?
[14098.43s -> 14099.31s]  They can just walk around.
[14109.04s -> 14110.48s]  Just let the engine explode.
[14111.58s -> 14115.02s]  If the engine explodes, then that's the end of this game for me.
[14115.02s -> 14117.48s]  Because then it'll be so humiliating.
[14117.48s -> 14118.44s]  I'll have to stop playing.
[14129.26s -> 14135.61s]  That's...
[14135.61s -> 14137.13s]  No, that's not it.
[14137.13s -> 14137.53s]  That's...
[14137.53s -> 14139.29s]  I have the binoculars.
[14139.29s -> 14141.77s]  Put the binoculars away if you could.
[14141.77s -> 14143.21s]  That would be fantastic.
[14150.75s -> 14151.71s]  Okay, Terminator.
[14152.67s -> 14157.69s]  God damn it.
[14164.91s -> 14166.51s]  Bulletproof down jackets.
[14167.31s -> 14169.84s]  That's not embarrassing.
[14169.84s -> 14170.16s]  That's...
[14170.16s -> 14170.80s]  I got ambushed.
[14171.52s -> 14186.57s]  Made it.
[14186.57s -> 14195.05s]  Give me the cutscene.
[14196.25s -> 14196.57s]  No.
[14197.05s -> 14199.63s]  I thought it was gonna go into a cutscene like it usually does.
[14200.35s -> 14202.03s]  Here we go.
[14203.66s -> 14204.30s]  Jump to fire.
[14205.52s -> 14205.84s]  Nice.
[14206.64s -> 14212.88s]  Let me in.
[14213.44s -> 14214.78s]  Let me in.
[14216.00s -> 14216.72s]  Let me in.
[14216.72s -> 14225.77s]  Don't fun-aloud.
[14225.77s -> 14229.58s]  All right, I'm gonna turn this in.
[14229.58s -> 14230.78s]  I'm gonna take a piss.
[14230.78s -> 14232.22s]  Here, we'll come back and figure out what we're gonna do.
[14242.24s -> 14254.62s]  If anybody touches this or anything on it...
[14254.62s -> 14255.34s]  We won?
[14255.34s -> 14256.62s]  What do you mean we won?
[14256.62s -> 14257.82s]  I have not made a decision yet.
[14258.62s -> 14271.00s]  You can't preemptively say you win while you hold the ball.
[14272.27s -> 14273.47s]  While it's seven to seven.
[14274.33s -> 14276.62s]  And you're running into the end zone.
[14276.62s -> 14278.06s]  You're ten yards away.
[14278.06s -> 14280.06s]  There's two or three people behind you about to tackle you.
[14280.06s -> 14281.98s]  You can't say we win.
[14281.98s -> 14283.42s]  Because what if you get tackled?
[14283.42s -> 14284.46s]  They're not gonna look good.
[14284.46s -> 14285.18s]  I keep telling you.
[14286.54s -> 14291.02s]  Everywhere you look, it's all one giant lava field.
[14291.02s -> 14292.54s]  25 feet solid rock.
[14293.10s -> 14296.14s]  It'll take jackhammers to...
[14296.14s -> 14298.22s]  I don't need a lecture, god damn it.
[14298.86s -> 14299.42s]  I get it.
[14300.14s -> 14301.02s]  I know you don't.
[14301.02s -> 14303.74s]  These people are hungry.
[14303.74s -> 14304.22s]  I don't...
[14304.22s -> 14307.74s]  Well, don't we have to at least see like the 500 zombies?
[14307.74s -> 14308.54s]  Remember E3?
[14308.54s -> 14309.42s]  I don't give a shit.
[14310.22s -> 14317.39s]  When are we gonna get the E3 moment when there's like 500 of them chasing us from behind?
[14317.39s -> 14318.78s]  Wouldn't that happen?
[14319.50s -> 14323.82s]  But this job's gotta get done, whether it takes all goddamn year.
[14324.46s -> 14328.48s]  It's not like we got somewhere else to be now, do we?
[14329.20s -> 14331.39s]  Wait, I'm not finished.
[14332.03s -> 14333.63s]  We'll make it quick, will ya, Al?
[14333.63s -> 14334.51s]  I got things to do.
[14335.23s -> 14339.87s]  Rippers, this morning one of my men spotted a large group of them coming over the pass.
[14339.87s -> 14341.31s]  And no one stopped them.
[14341.31s -> 14341.63s]  How the...
[14342.51s -> 14344.11s]  Tucker, you know we're already spread thin.
[14344.67s -> 14345.79s]  Are they headed north?
[14346.75s -> 14347.87s]  That's five hours in.
[14347.87s -> 14349.71s]  Are they headed towards us?
[14349.71s -> 14350.43s]  Yes or no?
[14353.44s -> 14356.92s]  I don't know.
[14356.92s -> 14357.96s]  E3 isn't real.
[14358.52s -> 14359.24s]  Maybe he knows.
[14359.24s -> 14359.96s]  Yeah, it is.
[14359.96s -> 14363.36s]  What the fuck are you up to now, huh?
[14363.36s -> 14364.40s]  What's this about, huh?
[14365.84s -> 14367.96s]  It's not his job to know.
[14367.96s -> 14369.64s]  It's your goddamn job to know.
[14370.36s -> 14372.60s]  I can't be in two places at one time.
[14372.60s -> 14374.60s]  You're the one me here running your dig.
[14375.24s -> 14378.68s]  You want me out there in the shit chasing the Rippers.
[14378.68s -> 14380.24s]  Go check the store.
[14380.24s -> 14381.84s]  See how much ammo we got left.
[14381.84s -> 14384.92s]  I'll tell Wheeler to watch the dig.
[14385.72s -> 14386.76s]  What are you looking at?
[14386.76s -> 14388.76s]  I don't know, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.
[14388.76s -> 14389.26s]  Don't.
[14390.04s -> 14392.54s]  No, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.
[14393.79s -> 14394.35s]  I can do that.
[14395.23s -> 14396.91s]  I don't know, man, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.
[14397.63s -> 14402.59s]  I thought that was a person's head for a second.
[14402.59s -> 14405.07s]  I was like, why would you be handing me a person's head to this prison?
[14408.19s -> 14408.91s]  Ride with me.
[14409.71s -> 14412.97s]  Oh, we're going to get a double mission here.
[14412.97s -> 14414.25s]  All right, this is going to be good.
[14414.25s -> 14415.53s]  We're in a golf cart, guys.
[14415.53s -> 14416.33s]  Now you want me to quit?
[14417.37s -> 14418.09s]  You want me to quit the game?
[14418.09s -> 14418.81s]  We're in a golf cart.
[14421.56s -> 14422.36s]  Is there a potential here?
[14427.80s -> 14429.56s]  It's not my problem.
[14429.56s -> 14431.00s]  You want our food.
[14431.00s -> 14433.23s]  I'm making it your problem.
[14433.23s -> 14434.59s]  Fine, the game is good.
[14434.59s -> 14436.83s]  Two runs for you, but we're not joining your goddamn camp.
[14437.71s -> 14440.83s]  Remind me again, my old woman's memory.
[14440.83s -> 14442.11s]  Why is that?
[14442.11s -> 14444.86s]  Because it's a waste of time, Tuck.
[14447.00s -> 14448.52s]  Well, aren't you the optimist?
[14448.52s -> 14450.84s]  Rockstar added poker to Red Dead and you're playing this?
[14453.88s -> 14457.40s]  I had to uninstall Red Dead Redemption 2 to install this game.
[14460.20s -> 14461.88s]  It's not closer or further.
[14461.88s -> 14463.56s]  Look, I'm not Boozer's old lady.
[14463.56s -> 14464.68s]  He goes where he wants.
[14468.62s -> 14469.66s]  It's like 40 gigs.
[14469.66s -> 14470.86s]  Shit's burning all day and night.
[14471.90s -> 14473.02s]  I had to uninstall Red Dead.
[14473.02s -> 14475.74s]  It's piling up out here with men like you doing your jobs.
[14475.74s -> 14476.14s]  It's a big game.
[14476.14s -> 14478.30s]  It's a damn bright game.
[14478.30s -> 14480.06s]  Try using more gasoline.
[14480.06s -> 14482.06s]  It burns faster, less fumes.
[14482.06s -> 14483.02s]  Why is this waving?
[14483.02s -> 14484.30s]  Like we got so much to spare?
[14484.30s -> 14487.02s]  When it's all gone, what are you going to put in that bike of yours?
[14487.02s -> 14487.90s]  Spit and sweat?
[14488.78s -> 14490.54s]  Now what the hell is going on here?
[14491.34s -> 14492.22s]  The count's off.
[14492.22s -> 14493.90s]  Storage is missing food and some ammo.
[14494.54s -> 14496.86s]  Jesus, who was on watch last night?
[14497.50s -> 14498.94s]  Give me control of the golf cart.
[14498.94s -> 14500.30s]  Tonight, double the watch.
[14500.38s -> 14502.22s]  This shit's starting to piss me off.
[14503.02s -> 14503.58s]  You got it.
[14504.72s -> 14505.76s]  Trouble in paradise.
[14506.40s -> 14507.76s]  It's like I was saying.
[14507.76s -> 14509.04s]  Camp's like a prison.
[14509.04s -> 14513.04s]  Bunch of goddamn lazy liars, thieves, rapists, and murderers.
[14513.04s -> 14513.92s]  You know why that is?
[14514.80s -> 14515.92s]  No idea.
[14515.92s -> 14517.04s]  Cause that's who we are.
[14517.04s -> 14517.44s]  Oh, now it is.
[14517.44s -> 14518.64s]  A freak show.
[14518.64s -> 14523.36s]  Only folks who survive are those mean enough and nasty enough to out-freak the freaks.
[14524.48s -> 14525.92s]  The rest are here.
[14525.92s -> 14529.28s]  Hope and I feed them, protect them, keep them nice and cozy and warm
[14529.28s -> 14532.16s]  so they can sit on their asses and watch the world end.
[14532.16s -> 14534.48s]  You, get your ass back to work.
[14534.48s -> 14536.08s]  Don't make me go get Cyrus.
[14536.08s -> 14536.88s]  We could've walked.
[14538.40s -> 14539.84s]  We could've just taken my motorcycle.
[14539.84s -> 14540.72s]  It's cooler.
[14540.72s -> 14542.72s]  Daytime is my time.
[14542.72s -> 14545.74s]  Running this camp is no different than running a prison.
[14546.86s -> 14548.46s]  I can't remember what you said.
[14548.46s -> 14549.58s]  You were, you were what?
[14549.58s -> 14550.94s]  You were a warden or something?
[14552.75s -> 14554.75s]  Nothing so high and mighty.
[14554.75s -> 14556.51s]  I was matron of the women's ward.
[14557.23s -> 14560.99s]  You look like the sort who might've spent some time in the pan a day.
[14561.63s -> 14568.51s]  Do we really have to do, I think, follow Cadgar around in Shadrath City?
[14569.15s -> 14570.91s]  Larson was on a run yesterday.
[14570.91s -> 14572.11s]  Passed through Marion Forks.
[14572.11s -> 14573.63s]  Every time we meet a new character.
[14573.63s -> 14576.51s]  Young woman with pants.
[14576.51s -> 14578.43s]  He stopped to look around but he never found her.
[14579.47s -> 14580.51s]  Is he sure?
[14580.51s -> 14582.59s]  Larson's been doing this as you.
[14582.59s -> 14584.11s]  He knows a person from a freak.
[14586.51s -> 14587.71s]  You can skip this?
[14587.71s -> 14588.21s]  How?
[14589.71s -> 14592.24s]  I'll see what I can do.
[14592.24s -> 14592.88s]  He's getting beat up.
[14592.88s -> 14596.56s]  Look, I want the rest of my credits for Leon.
[14597.84s -> 14601.92s]  You bring me warm bodies, I'll give you all the credits you can spend.
[14601.92s -> 14609.24s]  I gotta go find Wheeler.
[14609.24s -> 14611.16s]  Someone's looking at a knight in the shack.
[14611.96s -> 14613.98s]  Let me get in.
[14617.88s -> 14618.52s]  Let me on that.
[14618.52s -> 14619.00s]  Come on.
[14620.46s -> 14620.78s]  Come on.
[14620.78s -> 14621.66s]  Let me on my bike.
[14622.46s -> 14637.36s]  All right, I'm gonna go pee after we turn this in.
[14637.36s -> 14638.32s]  I'm gonna, we'll figure it out.
[14638.32s -> 14641.77s]  Alcott, what do you want, Drifter?
[14641.77s -> 14646.22s]  What's your problem?
[14646.22s -> 14650.46s]  One of my men escaped a ripper camp over by Iron Butte.
[14650.46s -> 14654.09s]  That tortured him, like they always do.
[14654.65s -> 14657.87s]  But this time, they kept asking him if he knew about it.
[14657.87s -> 14661.87s]  Two bikers, two men, asking if he'd ever seen them or heard of them.
[14661.87s -> 14663.15s]  A lot of bikes around here.
[14663.15s -> 14665.07s]  What's it got to do with me?
[14667.02s -> 14668.30s]  He's never gonna go pee.
[14668.30s -> 14669.26s]  The ripper called a mongrel.
[14669.26s -> 14670.94s]  How do you know I didn't already?
[14670.94s -> 14673.42s]  How many drifters still flying colors around here?
[14673.42s -> 14674.54s]  Is it that shit matters?
[14675.18s -> 14679.07s]  Can you ask me?
[14679.07s -> 14680.46s]  You got a price on your head.
[14680.46s -> 14681.98s]  Did have a coffee cup in here.
[14681.98s -> 14683.42s]  How's it feel to be on the other side?
[14684.24s -> 14686.40s]  Now why don't you just show me what you got because I don't have time.
[14686.40s -> 14688.88s]  Here's why you should never pee into a bottle or pee into a cup.
[14689.84s -> 14690.88s]  No matter what.
[14690.88s -> 14692.64s]  Because you'll run into a scenario like I did.
[14695.31s -> 14699.42s]  One time, I was in a long road trip.
[14700.06s -> 14701.95s]  I was in the passenger side.
[14710.70s -> 14711.20s]  What?
[14716.57s -> 14719.05s]  I'm talking about going pee into a bottle.
[14726.46s -> 14727.74s]  You can buy guns.
[14727.74s -> 14731.10s]  I see how it is.
[14731.10s -> 14737.10s]  Well, you guys must really be bored.
[14737.10s -> 14738.06s]  You don't want to hear my, like,
[14739.34s -> 14742.14s]  when I was sitting in the passenger seat, I peed into a bottle story?
[14742.78s -> 14744.25s]  Holy shit.
[14744.73s -> 14748.27s]  Oh my goodness.
[14748.91s -> 14755.47s]  You guys ever just test to see if it's possible?
[14767.52s -> 14768.02s]  Oh.
[14769.21s -> 14769.71s]  Choices.
[14770.17s -> 14773.20s]  Bring the drugs to Tucker.
[14773.20s -> 14774.56s]  Bring the drugs to Copeland.
[14775.50s -> 14777.90s]  Manny promised to help restore your piece of shit bike.
[14778.62s -> 14779.90s]  Weapons for sale.
[14779.90s -> 14780.54s]  I want the bike.
[14790.04s -> 14791.32s]  So I'm on a long road trip.
[14792.04s -> 14792.84s]  Couple of buddies.
[14805.40s -> 14806.28s]  There's no story.
[14811.60s -> 14813.36s]  Now you see, the story is,
[14814.88s -> 14816.80s]  if you want, this is the truth.
[14816.80s -> 14818.00s]  Here's like a little tip for you guys.
[14818.64s -> 14821.92s]  Anytime you tell a story that is not true,
[14822.72s -> 14823.92s]  it's still true,
[14823.92s -> 14826.96s]  but you're just making up a whole bunch of scenarios in the middle of it.
[14826.96s -> 14829.12s]  So, the real story is,
[14830.40s -> 14831.68s]  in a Gatorade bottle,
[14831.68s -> 14833.44s]  I don't know, maybe like seven years ago,
[14834.08s -> 14837.44s]  I just had a full piss and pissed into the Gatorade bottle to see if it was possible.
[14838.64s -> 14840.56s]  And I filled the whole Gatorade bottle up with pee
[14840.56s -> 14843.28s]  and still had to go and had to like waddle to the bathroom
[14843.28s -> 14844.56s]  to pee the rest into the toilet.
[14850.52s -> 14852.20s]  So don't bring a bottle of Gatorade,
[14852.20s -> 14854.04s]  the 32-ounce bottle of Gatorade, by the way, big one.
[14854.84s -> 14874.48s]  Uh-oh, I think he's getting bored.
[14874.48s -> 14878.48s]  Because now he's like, he's telling made-up stories
[14879.44s -> 14880.96s]  about peeing into bottles.
[14884.52s -> 14887.79s]  Uh-oh, I think we've crossed the line here.
[14888.51s -> 14892.44s]  Hey, let me tell you,
[14892.44s -> 14893.80s]  one time I like peed into a bottle.
[14893.80s -> 14894.84s]  I was passenger's peeing.
[14902.62s -> 14904.06s]  I'm out of gas again.
[14904.86s -> 14906.70s]  I'm gonna throw piss into the gas can.
[14918.60s -> 14919.10s]  No.
[14919.72s -> 14946.35s]  If you think I'm gonna actually answer the question
[14946.35s -> 14947.79s]  that's being put into chat right now,
[14949.96s -> 14951.24s]  you don't, you must not understand
[14951.24s -> 14952.76s]  that this is a family-friendly streamer.
[14964.78s -> 14965.66s]  Pee's dirty.
[14965.66s -> 14966.54s]  What if I peed?
[14988.75s -> 14989.87s]  You see, what I was trying to do there
[14989.87s -> 14992.43s]  is I was trying to make them jump off.
[14993.71s -> 14994.75s]  I didn't think it was that far.
[14996.94s -> 14998.78s]  That's not, no, the stream, that's not the stream.
[14998.78s -> 15000.30s]  The stream's still going.
[15000.30s -> 15007.15s]  What does it cost me to stop playing this fo-
[15007.15s -> 15007.65s]  No.
[15008.19s -> 15010.64s]  All right, I'm gonna go pee.
[15010.64s -> 15012.96s]  Let me pee and then contemplate my entire life.
[15013.76s -> 15015.52s]  I'll be back in like two minutes.
[15212.35s -> 15213.23s]  Can I just say something?
[15214.11s -> 15216.81s]  Let me say something.
[15217.85s -> 15219.29s]  Can we, I got something to say.
[15222.60s -> 15223.40s]  The fact that there's,
[15225.58s -> 15227.26s]  there are 3,200 people here right now, right?
[15228.28s -> 15229.80s]  And even if you don't like the game
[15229.80s -> 15230.60s]  and think this is, you know,
[15230.60s -> 15232.12s]  game's not great or, you know, whatever,
[15233.40s -> 15234.04s]  you're still here.
[15237.82s -> 15238.54s]  Thank you.
[15238.54s -> 15243.28s]  That's like, well, let's keep playing.
[15259.32s -> 15260.81s]  See, I'm like,
[15260.81s -> 15262.57s]  I'm like pulling your heartstrings here
[15262.57s -> 15264.83s]  to make it so you are like,
[15264.83s -> 15266.03s]  oh, yeah, yeah, this is good.
[15266.03s -> 15266.99s]  Thanks, man, it's a good game.
[15270.49s -> 15272.01s]  No, here's what's gonna happen.
[15272.01s -> 15272.81s]  All right, here's, no,
[15272.81s -> 15273.85s]  but I really do mean that though.
[15274.41s -> 15278.72s]  You know, people could just leave,
[15278.72s -> 15280.48s]  but you have,
[15280.48s -> 15281.60s]  you're like having your fun,
[15281.60s -> 15282.48s]  however you have it, right?
[15285.26s -> 15288.70s]  We're going to, what's going on?
[15292.25s -> 15292.89s]  Are you having fun?
[15292.89s -> 15293.93s]  I actually am.
[15293.93s -> 15294.49s]  I mean, it's not,
[15294.49s -> 15295.61s]  doesn't even matter what the game is.
[15296.25s -> 15298.49s]  It's just fun just to
[15299.13s -> 15300.01s]  dick around and have fun.
[15301.05s -> 15302.33s]  Doesn't have to be the game any good.
[15302.89s -> 15306.12s]  So we've been going for about four
[15306.12s -> 15307.64s]  and a half hours or so,
[15307.64s -> 15309.08s]  just about another like 10 minutes or so.
[15310.20s -> 15310.92s]  We are going to,
[15312.88s -> 15313.76s]  hear me out, okay?
[15313.84s -> 15314.72s]  Are you hearing me out?
[15316.96s -> 15317.60s]  Back to work.
[15317.60s -> 15318.08s]  What's back?
[15318.08s -> 15318.88s]  What is back to work?
[15319.52s -> 15329.13s]  See if it was possible.
[15329.13s -> 15330.09s]  See if what was possible.
[15330.65s -> 15338.75s]  What is this?
[15380.88s -> 15381.76s]  I'm laughing.
[15384.99s -> 15385.63s]  Back to work.
[15385.63s -> 15386.91s]  We had to listen to that.
[15388.43s -> 15389.71s]  I forgot to mute the mic.
[15389.71s -> 15391.07s]  Who is fucking hurting me?
[15392.99s -> 15399.23s]  Show us.
[15400.65s -> 15402.17s]  Yeah, it's just the BRB screen.
[15402.17s -> 15402.81s]  It's just this.
[15409.15s -> 15410.19s]  All right, guys, I'll see you.
[15410.19s -> 15410.83s]  Be right back.
[15411.39s -> 15412.67s]  Okay, see you soon.
[15412.67s -> 15413.95s]  Don't go anywhere.
[15413.95s -> 15414.91s]  Okay, bye.
[15414.91s -> 15441.16s]  That's so stupid.
[15443.24s -> 15448.28s]  Okay, so hear me out.
[15448.28s -> 15449.56s]  My fucking stomach hurts.
[15454.97s -> 15455.77s]  I'm going to listen.
[15455.77s -> 15456.73s]  Are you going to hear me out now?
[15458.12s -> 15460.44s]  I'm going to play this for like another...
[15461.24s -> 15461.72s]  Everyone's...
[15461.72s -> 15463.00s]  No, please.
[15463.00s -> 15464.36s]  Listen, don't hear me out.
[15464.36s -> 15465.85s]  Hey, hey, hold on.
[15465.85s -> 15466.49s]  Wait.
[15466.49s -> 15468.49s]  I'm going to play this for a little bit longer
[15469.44s -> 15471.28s]  and then I will end the stream
[15471.28s -> 15472.80s]  with a best out of three
[15473.44s -> 15475.20s]  Yahtzee Mario Tournament.
[15485.24s -> 15486.04s]  Okay.
[15486.04s -> 15488.32s]  Let me just do like another mission or two
[15488.32s -> 15488.64s]  and we'll...
[15490.32s -> 15491.68s]  I mean, like another 30 minutes or so.
[15491.68s -> 15493.44s]  We'll move on to Mario POG.
[15494.49s -> 15495.93s]  Mario Yacht.
[15495.93s -> 15496.97s]  You know what I'm saying.
[15496.97s -> 15497.69s]  That doesn't matter.
[15498.25s -> 15500.08s]  All right, where's my bike?
[15500.72s -> 15501.36s]  Where's my bike?
[15506.60s -> 15507.64s]  Back to work.
[15507.64s -> 15508.76s]  No, no, wait, wait.
[15508.76s -> 15509.64s]  I'm going back to work.
[15511.58s -> 15512.22s]  What's in here?
[15514.65s -> 15517.37s]  Yeah, this is a Mario Yahtzee waiting room
[15517.37s -> 15518.09s]  at this point.
[15518.65s -> 15521.72s]  That's so fucking stupid.
[15524.48s -> 15525.68s]  I'm never going to be able to repair this.
[15526.24s -> 15533.66s]  Check out a site called Talk to Transformer.
[15533.66s -> 15534.22s]  What is that?
[15541.05s -> 15541.45s]  I did have...
[15541.45s -> 15542.25s]  Yeah, I did have a bounty.
[15542.25s -> 15542.57s]  Hold on.
[15543.13s -> 15546.75s]  I got to get my bike out of there though.
[15546.75s -> 15549.93s]  Can I just call...
[15549.93s -> 15550.81s]  Okay, recover bike.
[15551.37s -> 15554.97s]  Recover bike to your location.
[15555.98s -> 15556.48s]  There it is.
[15561.12s -> 15564.89s]  Just everything about that is fucking hilarious to me
[15564.89s -> 15565.93s]  because everyone's like,
[15565.93s -> 15567.29s]  dude, why are you like playing this game?
[15567.29s -> 15567.85s]  Like, stop.
[15567.85s -> 15569.05s]  Like, do something else.
[15569.05s -> 15569.93s]  We can play Mario.
[15569.93s -> 15570.81s]  No, no, I'm not.
[15570.81s -> 15571.53s]  I need to play this.
[15572.09s -> 15572.97s]  I got to play this game.
[15572.97s -> 15573.93s]  I'm having a great time.
[15576.08s -> 15576.72s]  Back to work.
[15578.70s -> 15585.74s]  Ah, can you move out of the way?
[15585.74s -> 15589.08s]  That's what I said.
[15589.72s -> 15601.32s]  All right, what is like the mechanic?
[15601.96s -> 15606.92s]  All right, can't mechanics for fuel repair,
[15606.92s -> 15608.28s]  customize and upgrade your bike parts.
[15608.84s -> 15611.80s]  Is the game muted?
[15611.80s -> 15613.16s]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[15613.96s -> 15614.76s]  It is.
[15614.76s -> 15617.40s]  All right, let's put $284 to repair the bike.
[15618.20s -> 15619.80s]  226 free fuel.
[15621.12s -> 15622.24s]  Get out of here.
[15622.24s -> 15623.36s]  Your bike could use some work.
[15625.08s -> 15625.56s]  Check back.
[15627.56s -> 15628.28s]  I have like money.
[15628.84s -> 15629.88s]  See you later.
[15629.88s -> 15631.08s]  I like, I have like,
[15631.08s -> 15631.88s]  I like have like money.
[15631.88s -> 15632.68s]  I like have like,
[15632.68s -> 15633.56s]  like I have like like money.
[15634.52s -> 15640.70s]  Hey, I haven't seen Boozer around much lately.
[15641.84s -> 15643.04s]  Yeah, he's around.
[15643.04s -> 15645.28s]  I guess he's just been doing more for Copeland lately.
[15645.28s -> 15646.16s]  Didn't I turn him on?
[15648.00s -> 15649.84s]  You tell him I said get off his ass.
[15649.84s -> 15650.32s]  Turn in.
[15651.28s -> 15652.32s]  Am I messing something here?
[15652.32s -> 15652.80s]  Turn in.
[15652.80s -> 15653.92s]  Yeah, I'll let him know.
[15653.92s -> 15654.64s]  Sell one.
[15654.64s -> 15655.44s]  Did I already do it?
[15656.32s -> 15658.14s]  Am I insane?
[15658.14s -> 15658.94s]  Maybe next time.
[15659.50s -> 15660.30s]  Stop by soon.
[15661.02s -> 15665.98s]  That's just something.
[15665.98s -> 15667.02s]  I've got the courage to take.
[15667.74s -> 15670.01s]  All right, let's go.
[15670.65s -> 15672.91s]  I can get a weapon.
[15674.76s -> 15676.04s]  Sell all the bear traps.
[15676.04s -> 15687.58s]  I don't actually have any ammunition over here.
[15687.58s -> 15688.46s]  Let me see if I can get a gun.
[15694.08s -> 15694.88s]  Merchant, all right.
[15695.52s -> 15699.20s]  How you doing?
[15699.20s -> 15699.84s]  Hi.
[15699.84s -> 15700.88s]  Hey, what's up?
[15700.88s -> 15701.60s]  All right, weapons.
[15702.32s -> 15703.28s]  22 repeater.
[15704.41s -> 15705.45s]  I can buy the repeater.
[15706.17s -> 15707.72s]  I can buy a sidearm.
[15707.72s -> 15709.16s]  I can, I already have this.
[15710.72s -> 15712.16s]  22 repeater.
[15712.16s -> 15714.32s]  Very low stopping car requires a lot of headshots.
[15714.32s -> 15717.20s]  This is somewhat offset by ammo availability and quick fire rate.
[15718.40s -> 15718.90s]  Repeater.
[15719.68s -> 15721.08s]  Thousand bucks.
[15722.12s -> 15722.62s]  Sure.
[15723.52s -> 15724.56s]  That right there?
[15724.56s -> 15725.28s]  Good piece.
[15725.28s -> 15725.78s]  Thank you.
[15727.21s -> 15728.01s]  All right, supplies.
[15729.31s -> 15729.95s]  Ammo full.
[15729.95s -> 15731.07s]  Ammo full.
[15731.07s -> 15731.79s]  Pistol ammo.
[15731.79s -> 15733.07s]  Let's get some fillet ammo up.
[15734.43s -> 15735.07s]  Upgrade.
[15735.07s -> 15736.51s]  Sidearm suppressor.
[15736.51s -> 15737.55s]  Primary suppressor.
[15738.27s -> 15738.91s]  Miasmo.
[15739.47s -> 15740.67s]  Good as new.
[15740.67s -> 15742.99s]  And okay, what about, I can't do grenades.
[15744.30s -> 15744.80s]  Locker.
[15746.38s -> 15746.88s]  Cool.
[15747.79s -> 15749.95s]  All right, all right, all right.
[15751.02s -> 15752.38s]  All right, all right, all right.
[15753.69s -> 15757.45s]  Let's do one more mission and then I want to see the trail of zombies.
[15757.45s -> 15758.49s]  And then we can move on.
[15758.49s -> 15758.99s]  Okay.
[15760.68s -> 15762.44s]  And then tomorrow, what do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[15763.16s -> 15764.46s]  What do you want to do tomorrow?
[15766.01s -> 15768.81s]  Let's make our friend hangout plan for tomorrow.
[15768.81s -> 15769.69s]  What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[15770.57s -> 15777.40s]  Because here, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
[15777.40s -> 15786.27s]  We've got Salmon Max Season 2 Episode 3 is going to be on probably Saturday or Sunday.
[15787.95s -> 15791.87s]  And then MS DOS Part 2 is going to be either Saturday or Sunday.
[15792.51s -> 15795.93s]  What is the best way to make it out of here?
[15803.18s -> 15804.38s]  I got to get the heck out of here.
[15808.30s -> 15809.26s]  Locate the drifter.
[15810.97s -> 15812.65s]  I guess just get me out of here.
[15813.53s -> 15814.81s]  This is really far away.
[15817.47s -> 15818.83s]  Like really far away.
[15825.24s -> 15826.04s]  Rage 2.
[15831.32s -> 15837.32s]  I feel like two AAA back-to-back games like this in a row probably aren't very good to do.
[15838.12s -> 15843.60s]  Can I get out of this time?
[15843.60s -> 15847.50s]  I don't know, we'll figure it out.
[15848.06s -> 15850.14s]  This is AAA.
[15850.14s -> 15851.82s]  This is as AAA as they come.
[15851.82s -> 15853.34s]  This is a Sony first party game.
[15854.78s -> 15855.28s]  Exclusive.
[15861.98s -> 15863.82s]  Why are they guys naked?
[15864.54s -> 15867.71s]  Why are these guys naked?
[15868.27s -> 15875.58s]  Were they swimming?
[15880.88s -> 15882.72s]  I guess they just, they're just naked.
[15883.88s -> 15887.28s]  All right, can I get out this way?
[15887.28s -> 15891.88s]  Or do I have to, I can't just go up the mountain.
[15892.44s -> 15895.93s]  I can't cross this.
[15896.49s -> 15898.09s]  The bike's going to get destroyed if I cross this.
[15907.28s -> 15908.72s]  No, I'm not going to ford the river.
[15909.44s -> 15911.20s]  That would be the last time you see this guy.
[15912.00s -> 15912.96s]  We need to just get out.
[15919.23s -> 15919.79s]  All right, out.
[15920.67s -> 15921.47s]  Finally.
[15921.47s -> 15923.77s]  Are we out?
[15923.77s -> 15925.44s]  We're making our way out.
[15926.40s -> 15926.80s]  I think.
[15929.52s -> 15930.40s]  No, we're not.
[15930.80s -> 15933.04s]  I need to get back to this road.
[15933.04s -> 15949.96s]  I guess we're just going to go over here.
[15960.41s -> 15961.69s]  Time for Mario.
[15961.69s -> 15962.81s]  No, it's not Mario time.
[15964.01s -> 15965.61s]  It's not Mario time.
[15966.41s -> 15969.13s]  It will be very soon.
[15969.13s -> 15970.09s]  I'm going to do one more.
[15971.52s -> 15973.12s]  Oh, why?
[15973.12s -> 15976.80s]  What didn't, wasn't this just taking me over here?
[15977.84s -> 15979.76s]  Wait, what is it doing to me now?
[15980.48s -> 15990.32s]  It's up ahead, wait, sorry.
[15990.32s -> 15991.92s]  What, what's this transformer thing?
[15991.92s -> 15993.60s]  Talk to the transformers?
[15993.60s -> 15995.44s]  This is Radio Free Oregon.
[15995.44s -> 15997.12s]  The truth shall set you free.
[15997.92s -> 16001.12s]  Oh, not in the mood.
[16001.76s -> 16010.57s]  Start the story prompt.
[16010.57s -> 16012.81s]  It fills the rest of the story up automatically.
[16017.20s -> 16018.08s]  Shit, that's right.
[16018.08s -> 16019.92s]  I got to finish burning out these nests.
[16019.92s -> 16021.12s]  Well, I don't have to finish anything.
[16022.16s -> 16023.68s]  I don't have to do anything.
[16023.68s -> 16024.40s]  You can just go.
[16026.76s -> 16028.28s]  All right, mission time.
[16028.28s -> 16029.16s]  Then we're moving on.
[16030.20s -> 16031.40s]  That sounds pretty cool.
[16032.20s -> 16036.51s]  All right, now we're going to go here.
[16045.63s -> 16060.49s]  Well, I mean, the fuel is at half already.
[16060.65s -> 16062.33s]  It's because I was driving around the circle
[16062.33s -> 16065.29s]  trying to leave through the one opening
[16065.29s -> 16066.41s]  that I could leave through.
[16067.29s -> 16069.93s]  The one four foot square
[16069.93s -> 16072.25s]  I was allowed to go through to leave the camp.
[16082.30s -> 16085.74s]  Uh, you seriously just did that to me.
[16085.74s -> 16086.70s]  What a sniper.
[16099.20s -> 16101.12s]  This is seriously driving me fucking crazy.
[16120.62s -> 16121.98s]  Should have gone back to work.
[16122.78s -> 16124.88s]  Get in there.
[16125.92s -> 16126.24s]  Come on.
[16132.52s -> 16141.34s]  Days gone by legendary game designer Clyde Barker.
[16142.73s -> 16143.45s]  Who made this game?
[16143.45s -> 16144.65s]  More bounties.
[16144.65s -> 16150.44s]  Use this.
[16157.68s -> 16159.24s]  Bob Barker.
[16159.24s -> 16163.21s]  Dude, that's seriously the worst thing ever.
[16166.20s -> 16169.48s]  I'm talking like even a tap, like a little touch.
[16169.48s -> 16173.44s]  If you touch this fucking thing, your map will come up.
[16173.44s -> 16177.32s]  This is guys that made Zoo Tycoon made this.
[16177.32s -> 16180.76s]  That's a kind of long way away from with Zoo Tycoon.
[16189.69s -> 16190.65s]  I got sniped again.
[16191.21s -> 16193.69s]  I know you missed it because the internet sucks.
[16195.92s -> 16198.24s]  But somebody jumped again and did the same thing.
[16202.25s -> 16209.58s]  I don't know if anybody saw it, but it happened.
[16223.80s -> 16226.19s]  Yes, pick up the gas.
[16238.99s -> 16240.75s]  That FPS drop and the lights come on.
[16244.00s -> 16246.64s]  Yeah, unfortunately, we're stuck with the
[16246.64s -> 16252.72s]  internet being bad very recently here.
[16256.24s -> 16259.60s]  We usually hit this string of like a couple hours in a row.
[16259.60s -> 16261.92s]  We dropped like 20,000, 30,000 frames.
[16264.04s -> 16264.92s]  No more.
[16264.92s -> 16266.36s]  My getting more phone calls.
[16266.36s -> 16267.32s]  More phone calls.
[16267.32s -> 16267.72s]  Hello.
[16267.72s -> 16268.04s]  Hello.
[16268.04s -> 16268.44s]  Who is it?
[16268.44s -> 16269.96s]  Yes, it's happening again.
[16269.96s -> 16271.00s]  Problems are still here.
[16275.80s -> 16276.12s]  Thanks.
[16288.65s -> 16290.01s]  Oh, that's not good.
[16303.80s -> 16304.76s]  I can land that.
[16304.76s -> 16305.40s]  I know I can.
[16309.07s -> 16310.11s]  God damn engine.
[16310.75s -> 16311.47s]  I can land it.
[16321.84s -> 16324.96s]  I thought I could minimize damage if I land flat.
[16325.68s -> 16335.23s]  I guess not a terminal velocity.
[16338.94s -> 16339.90s]  I think I still can.
[16369.42s -> 16375.32s]  I just imagine like a fucking five-year-old
[16375.32s -> 16376.84s]  that just doesn't understand that I'm driving.
[16376.84s -> 16378.28s]  It just keeps flying off the cliff.
[16380.06s -> 16381.34s]  You should probably change to easy.
[16381.34s -> 16382.70s]  And you know, easy, I guess.
[16383.50s -> 16384.14s]  What's that?
[16385.42s -> 16387.58s]  I just want to drive your motorcycle.
[16387.58s -> 16395.55s]  I can't believe there's a you should change to easy mode.
[16399.44s -> 16400.16s]  Get off the car.
[16404.14s -> 16405.34s]  I can't make it.
[16405.34s -> 16406.38s]  I have to accept it.
[16409.93s -> 16410.25s]  Uh-oh.
[16413.79s -> 16414.59s]  My stomach hurts.
[16414.59s -> 16415.39s]  Hold on.
[16415.39s -> 16416.59s]  Where's my health?
[16416.59s -> 16416.99s]  Heal.
[16417.55s -> 16423.28s]  I'm gonna push you off the edge.
[16423.28s -> 16424.64s]  Come on, off the edge.
[16424.64s -> 16425.92s]  Oh, the one opportunity.
[16425.92s -> 16426.72s]  There it is.
[16426.72s -> 16426.96s]  Back.
[16428.09s -> 16428.49s]  Do it.
[16430.25s -> 16431.29s]  Go off the edge.
[16431.29s -> 16432.81s]  Why is there an invisible wall here?
[16433.93s -> 16434.57s]  Go off.
[16435.90s -> 16436.94s]  Oh, come on.
[16436.94s -> 16437.98s]  That's such bullshit.
[16438.94s -> 16440.65s]  That would have been so...
[16440.65s -> 16441.37s]  We could have stir...
[16441.37s -> 16443.37s]  Ah, that would have been so cool.
[16443.37s -> 16448.04s]  Can I get this?
[16448.84s -> 16451.08s]  And back up is the question.
[16451.08s -> 16456.12s]  Yes, I can.
[16457.16s -> 16458.12s]  Oh, yes, I can.
[16463.24s -> 16463.80s]  Bullshit.
[16464.36s -> 16468.94s]  I should be able to get down this.
[16469.02s -> 16473.18s]  I need to go that way.
[16490.67s -> 16493.23s]  Now it's like a fucking YouTuber joke.
[16493.23s -> 16494.03s]  I'm moving on.
[16501.13s -> 16502.17s]  I tried to back up.
[16502.17s -> 16503.53s]  I better thought I was gonna back it up.
[16505.55s -> 16507.71s]  Fucking wily coyote over here, yeah.
[16514.94s -> 16518.97s]  It was that simple.
[16518.97s -> 16521.93s]  I didn't know there was gonna be a place to go up here.
[16522.89s -> 16523.69s]  It was that easy.
[16523.69s -> 16524.65s]  It was so easy.
[16530.56s -> 16532.80s]  The bike is slow, but I think it's because it's not upgraded.
[16533.60s -> 16536.08s]  I'm pretty sure you can upgrade the bike and make it better and faster.
[16547.10s -> 16549.02s]  Better, stronger, faster, faster.
[16549.98s -> 16553.15s]  Snower, faster.
[16554.03s -> 16570.43s]  I'm sitting there looking at my internet.
[16570.43s -> 16573.55s]  I'm looking over on the right side because it went down again
[16573.55s -> 16578.33s]  and I took my eyes off the fucking screen to look over here.
[16589.82s -> 16590.94s]  I thought it was at zero.
[16591.66s -> 16592.54s]  It was at zero.
[16594.36s -> 16598.12s]  All right, we're gonna have to have another angry phone call to cox.
[16598.12s -> 16598.44s]  Great.
[16599.24s -> 16602.52s]  Every like three months I gotta call some internet company and be like,
[16602.52s -> 16607.80s]  hey, I'm a customer and I deserve to be treated right.
[16608.84s -> 16609.72s]  Oh my goodness.
[16632.65s -> 16638.00s]  We're almost there.
[16639.20s -> 16640.16s]  We'll get there this time.
[16642.94s -> 16643.42s]  Wait, what?
[16644.06s -> 16649.88s]  There's no fast travel.
[16649.88s -> 16650.92s]  Fast travel from map.
[16673.32s -> 16675.80s]  Summon Solary makes it way easier.
[16676.84s -> 16684.81s]  Nobody told me I could fast travel.
[16684.81s -> 16688.65s]  The game spent so long pausing the game to tell me I can repair my bike,
[16688.65s -> 16690.17s]  but it never told me I could fast travel.
[16698.14s -> 16698.54s]  Here we go.
[16698.54s -> 16699.10s]  This is it.
[16699.10s -> 16699.82s]  Then we can move on.
[16722.44s -> 16723.16s]  I found some stuff.
[16724.84s -> 16725.16s]  Found him.
[16725.16s -> 16725.48s]  He's dead.
[16726.52s -> 16730.00s]  Reloaded the bike.
[16738.06s -> 16739.82s]  Resistant coma.
[16739.82s -> 16741.98s]  Should be it.
[16741.98s -> 16746.25s]  That I hit it.
[16748.32s -> 16748.96s]  I really did.
[16749.52s -> 16753.20s]  Which way?
[16756.09s -> 16757.61s]  Back on track.
[16757.61s -> 16758.17s]  There he is.
[16759.68s -> 16760.80s]  Biker Bounty.
[16760.80s -> 16762.32s]  Some bounty targets will stand and fight.
[16762.32s -> 16763.04s]  Others will flee.
[16763.04s -> 16765.04s]  Chase your target out and capture them alive to complete the job.
[16765.04s -> 16767.28s]  Ramming into and shooting their bike are the best options.
[16768.08s -> 16769.44s]  Keep your target alive.
[16769.44s -> 16770.64s]  Silver helmet.
[16770.64s -> 16771.76s]  Red gas tank.
[16771.76s -> 16772.16s]  That's him.
[16774.01s -> 16774.65s]  Where are you going?
[16774.65s -> 16775.21s]  Oh shit.
[16775.85s -> 16776.41s]  Get away.
[16777.05s -> 16778.97s]  So you thought you'd ride into Copeland's camp.
[16778.97s -> 16780.01s]  I shoot the place up.
[16780.01s -> 16781.05s]  That about right.
[16781.05s -> 16782.01s]  Kill a few folks.
[16782.01s -> 16782.97s]  Take some shit.
[16782.97s -> 16783.69s]  Just ride out.
[16783.69s -> 16784.25s]  Take a shit.
[16786.49s -> 16787.69s]  How do I shoot from the bike?
[16787.69s -> 16787.85s]  I don't know.
[16787.85s -> 16788.33s]  But I'm going to wait.
[16788.33s -> 16789.13s]  Nobody taught me that.
[16790.73s -> 16791.77s]  I think he was waiting for me.
[16798.75s -> 16799.31s]  Bike combat.
[16799.31s -> 16802.67s]  While on the bike, tap L1 to acquire a target and tap R1 to fire your sidearm.
[16803.71s -> 16804.21s]  There it is.
[16806.43s -> 16814.38s]  The size of your target displays how accurate you are.
[16814.38s -> 16816.86s]  The smaller the rectangle, the better your accuracy.
[16817.98s -> 16820.68s]  I would say, ow, my bike.
[16834.88s -> 16840.54s]  Did he shoot himself?
[16842.38s -> 16843.82s]  Wait, who is talking now?
[16845.42s -> 16846.94s]  Why did he fly off like that?
[16847.74s -> 16849.58s]  I think he blew himself up.
[16849.58s -> 16860.49s]  How am I supposed to keep him alive?
[16860.49s -> 16861.77s]  Is he alive?
[16861.77s -> 16863.13s]  I don't think he's alive after that.
[16872.06s -> 16873.02s]  Oh, god.
[16881.37s -> 16882.57s]  Give drifters a bad name.
[16882.57s -> 16883.61s]  He has a little bit of dirt on his face.
[16883.61s -> 16884.57s]  What if you had shot me?
[16884.57s -> 16884.97s]  Like on his face.
[16884.97s -> 16886.25s]  He has like a smudge.
[16886.25s -> 16888.09s]  Stupid piece of shit.
[16890.65s -> 16892.24s]  Screw you.
[16892.24s -> 16892.96s]  Does it pick him up?
[16892.96s -> 16894.40s]  You want a Copeland Stonys?
[16894.40s -> 16898.40s]  You little bitch.
[16898.40s -> 16899.52s]  That's what you are.
[16899.52s -> 16900.56s]  You little bitch.
[16900.56s -> 16900.80s]  I'm...
[16901.44s -> 16902.72s]  Okay, mission complete.
[16904.44s -> 16904.84s]  All right.
[16905.56s -> 16906.04s]  Unlocked.
[16906.04s -> 16906.76s]  Gear up for the ride.
[16907.48s -> 16909.48s]  Copeland's encampment custom accent.
[16909.48s -> 16911.00s]  Cope, it's done.
[16911.00s -> 16911.48s]  Got him.
[16912.86s -> 16915.10s]  Mark down these coordinates and send your man out here.
[16916.86s -> 16917.58s]  Is he alive?
[16918.46s -> 16919.82s]  Hey, hey, drifter.
[16921.08s -> 16922.52s]  Yeah, he's alive.
[16922.52s -> 16925.00s]  But I won't promise you how long he's going to stay that way.
[16925.00s -> 16925.56s]  Deacon out.
[16930.75s -> 16932.19s]  You tell him, drifter.
[16932.19s -> 16933.39s]  You tell him that's such a good...
[16939.66s -> 16941.10s]  That's what I'm doing.
[16942.78s -> 16944.16s]  Oh, knocked his helmet off.
[16945.20s -> 16945.76s]  What?
[16947.15s -> 16950.03s]  I talked to Al-Kai the other day, some of the other men.
[16950.03s -> 16952.86s]  You've been doing runs for the camp.
[16953.79s -> 16955.23s]  I just wanted to say thank you.
[16956.73s -> 16957.21s]  That's...
[16957.21s -> 16958.33s]  I'm hitting him right in the face.
[16970.76s -> 16971.64s]  St. John.
[16971.64s -> 16972.36s]  This is Copeland.
[16973.24s -> 16974.92s]  I haven't seen Boozer in a few days.
[16976.12s -> 16977.80s]  He used to do runs for me, is all.
[16978.60s -> 16980.56s]  I know you ride with him.
[16980.56s -> 16981.84s]  Tried to radio him.
[16981.84s -> 16983.28s]  Can't seem to reach him.
[16983.28s -> 16986.83s]  Well, you see him, you tell him to swing by and say hello to Cope.
[16991.37s -> 16991.69s]  Hi.
[16996.43s -> 16997.71s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[16997.71s -> 17011.56s]  Okay.
[17011.56s -> 17018.84s]  Well, he tried.
[17018.84s -> 17046.51s]  He's just made of stone.
[17048.80s -> 17049.36s]  Oh, no.
[17050.48s -> 17051.12s]  Stone men.
[17051.92s -> 17068.84s]  I don't know why I got up.
[17071.72s -> 17078.20s]  There's no bullets in the gun.
[17094.72s -> 17095.84s]  Stop smoking weed.
[17096.56s -> 17099.23s]  What do you mean stop smoking weed?
[17099.23s -> 17100.67s]  It's illegal in Las Vegas.
[17104.11s -> 17106.03s]  It's legal in Las Vegas.
[17106.03s -> 17107.53s]  What are you talking about?
[17107.53s -> 17109.39s]  I mean, like, what are you...
[17110.27s -> 17111.40s]  Somebody thought I was going to do it.
[17113.02s -> 17114.54s]  Thing that I do all the time.
[17115.10s -> 17120.72s]  One of the camps can use this.
[17121.44s -> 17123.80s]  I don't think so.
[17125.76s -> 17127.04s]  Somebody knows what I was going to do.
[17127.68s -> 17131.05s]  He smokes way too much weed.
[17131.05s -> 17133.05s]  That's why he's like so dumb, you know?
[17133.85s -> 17134.81s]  He smokes too much weed.
[17134.81s -> 17135.61s]  It makes him dumb.
[17136.49s -> 17143.39s]  Fast travel, but hold on.
[17144.11s -> 17149.88s]  Just needed to get some speed, that's all.
[17150.76s -> 17153.24s]  I just needed some speed to hit the stone men.
[17156.01s -> 17156.49s]  That's it.
[17156.49s -> 17158.17s]  Just need to go fast.
[17160.91s -> 17161.63s]  Fast travel?
[17161.63s -> 17162.75s]  Nah, we don't fast travel.
[17162.75s -> 17164.67s]  We fucking slow travel in these parts.
[17170.33s -> 17171.37s]  Just naturally dumb.
[17172.01s -> 17176.33s]  Hey, I'd rather be naturally dumb
[17177.21s -> 17178.49s]  than unnaturally dumb.
[17180.08s -> 17182.64s]  I don't need performance enhancing drugs to be dumb.
[17182.64s -> 17183.44s]  I'll check up on you.
[17186.68s -> 17187.88s]  Hang in there, buddy.
[17187.88s -> 17189.40s]  Soon as we get that arm patched up,
[17189.40s -> 17190.36s]  we'll ride to the north.
[17190.36s -> 17191.08s]  Just like you said.
[17197.69s -> 17198.09s]  Just work.
[17199.45s -> 17200.25s]  Perfect.
[17200.25s -> 17201.53s]  That's what falls off the back.
[17201.53s -> 17204.41s]  And it's a red explosive.
[17204.41s -> 17206.01s]  I still got some work to do on the bike
[17206.01s -> 17207.45s]  and we got to stock up on some gear.
[17207.45s -> 17208.49s]  But once you're passed up,
[17209.29s -> 17210.65s]  we're out of here, peeking out.
[17211.45s -> 17214.30s]  Okay, this is it.
[17214.30s -> 17236.64s]  Yeah, this camp is gonna be crawling.
[17236.64s -> 17239.44s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, going in nice slow, nice ammo.
[17240.80s -> 17241.44s]  Nice and quiet.
[17244.64s -> 17245.87s]  I'll give you quiet.
[17264.11s -> 17266.35s]  I gave up a heck in the middle of that.
[17267.31s -> 17269.15s]  I was gonna do really hard
[17269.15s -> 17270.51s]  and then I just got bored halfway through
[17270.51s -> 17271.23s]  and I was like, I can't.
[17271.23s -> 17272.03s]  I'm doing, I'm done.
[17274.28s -> 17275.24s]  That was thunderstruck.
[17275.24s -> 17276.12s]  It was the beginning.
[17276.12s -> 17277.40s]  It was, I was trying for it.
[17278.68s -> 17279.72s]  Let's make some noise.
[17286.06s -> 17286.78s]  Give me the first line.
[17287.66s -> 17289.68s]  Can somebody give me the first line to thunderstruck?
[17290.56s -> 17293.63s]  Okay.
[17293.63s -> 17294.97s]  I don't even hear it.
[17300.60s -> 17302.60s]  No, no, not thunder.
[17302.60s -> 17303.48s]  What does he say?
[17303.48s -> 17304.52s]  The first line.
[17310.28s -> 17311.24s]  Yeah, I know it's like...
[17311.96s -> 17316.78s]  Oh my God, what does he actually say though?
[17317.82s -> 17323.58s]  Oh my God, I'm still alive.
[17350.01s -> 17351.13s]  I gotta get on the bikes.
[17351.13s -> 17351.77s]  I'm gonna die.
[17352.33s -> 17352.97s]  Wait, rags.
[17363.69s -> 17364.65s]  They won't let me die.
[17365.37s -> 17367.68s]  Oh, finally we got a train.
[17367.68s -> 17368.64s]  We got our first train.
[17369.28s -> 17369.76s]  How many is it?
[17369.76s -> 17370.80s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[17373.53s -> 17374.03s]  Ready?
[17374.89s -> 17386.72s]  Get out of the way.
[17386.72s -> 17387.20s]  I'm trying to...
[17391.26s -> 17392.78s]  Why am I still alive?
[17392.78s -> 17394.14s]  Did it switch on easy mode?
[17411.32s -> 17414.16s]  I'm done.
[17422.68s -> 17423.56s]  Hey, just kidding.
[17447.12s -> 17447.68s]  Son of a...
[17464.84s -> 17465.88s]  What am I looking for here?
[17465.88s -> 17468.84s]  Uh, clearly an infestation logging camp of infestations.
[17469.96s -> 17470.68s]  You got it.
[17470.68s -> 17472.36s]  One, two, three...
[17473.64s -> 17475.87s]  That just didn't do anything.
[17475.87s -> 17478.99s]  Like I said, I ain't this old lady, Deacon Alba.
[17478.99s -> 17480.65s]  Can they get up here?
[17481.37s -> 17486.11s]  Pretty good spot.
[17486.83s -> 17492.05s]  Two.
[17494.03s -> 17494.59s]  Finally.
[17494.59s -> 17495.09s]  Jesus.
[17497.20s -> 17497.70s]  Bounty.
[17498.56s -> 17499.44s]  Where's Mario?
[17499.44s -> 17499.76s]  Fuck.
[17499.76s -> 17500.48s]  Hold on, just wait.
[17501.36s -> 17501.76s]  Just wait.
[17501.76s -> 17503.12s]  Just have a little bit of patience.
[17506.75s -> 17511.07s]  Have, you know, have five hours of patience.
[17511.07s -> 17512.43s]  You know, I have to have a little bit of patience.
[17513.07s -> 17529.10s]  Where are you at?
[17529.66s -> 17533.02s]  Where's the final two or three?
[17540.17s -> 17544.03s]  Dermot lied about Mario.
[17544.03s -> 17546.51s]  Dermot did not lie about Mario because Mario is going to come on the screen
[17547.31s -> 17548.27s]  very, very shortly.
[17549.31s -> 17550.43s]  In no time at all.
[17550.43s -> 17552.43s]  You don't even believe how quickly it's going to be on the screen.
[17554.43s -> 17560.40s]  I'm going to title the stream, Mario Yahtzee Rematch.
[17569.18s -> 17576.25s]  Zero does much clearer than nests.
[17576.89s -> 17579.79s]  I don't think I even have any molotovs to do that with.
[17582.56s -> 17583.06s]  Do I?
[17583.76s -> 17585.04s]  I think I threw them all being a dumbass.
[17585.04s -> 17593.21s]  I can only, how many can I craft?
[17593.21s -> 17593.85s]  Just a few?
[17594.41s -> 17594.91s]  Okay.
[17618.78s -> 17622.24s]  I need more stuff.
[17622.24s -> 17623.04s]  Hurry, hurry.
[17625.40s -> 17625.90s]  Monster.
[17632.17s -> 17633.72s]  I got double capped right there.
[17647.42s -> 17650.22s]  Be brave.
[17650.94s -> 17651.74s]  Pile of shit.
[17654.41s -> 17656.17s]  Be brave, assholes.
[17656.17s -> 17657.05s]  Why are you saying that?
[17657.85s -> 17665.88s]  There's another one probably over here.
[17670.24s -> 17672.30s]  Oh, there's got to be a nest in this shack.
[17675.79s -> 17678.01s]  Boys, just keep that out of sleep.
[17678.01s -> 17679.13s]  Don't pay no attention.
[17679.13s -> 17683.88s]  Did he say, oh, no, I missed?
[17684.44s -> 17685.24s]  Oh, no, I missed.
[17687.16s -> 17689.16s]  Come on, boys and girls.
[17689.16s -> 17689.80s]  Let's do this.
[17690.68s -> 17692.49s]  He's like way too pumped up.
[17694.89s -> 17713.26s]  I need more bolts.
[17714.36s -> 17714.86s]  Yeah.
[17719.45s -> 17720.73s]  Oh, fuck.
[17720.73s -> 17727.44s]  I'm going to die because I'm going to die.
