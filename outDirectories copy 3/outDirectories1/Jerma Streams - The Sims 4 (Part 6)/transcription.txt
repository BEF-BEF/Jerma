[5.56s -> 42.47s]  I hope I haven't saved in the right spot because right immediately after, I believe it was
[42.47s -> 49.74s]  some poison it has to be disposed of coming up here at the birthday party. Otto's good.
[49.74s -> 64.30s]  Otto's fine. Just needed some routine checkup and he needed his shot. So he's good. If you
[64.30s -> 73.89s]  don't know, Otto has Addison's disease. So he needs, essentially for the rest of his life,
[74.85s -> 82.99s]  he needs to get a injection to help stop some of the symptoms. But he lives a perfectly normal,
[82.99s -> 90.43s]  happy life on the medication. And he's coming on, I think, 13 or 14 years old here. He's doing great.
[92.22s -> 103.38s]  But anyways, what up? Pod watchers skip. It's the intro. Actually, if you could skip the intro,
[103.38s -> 109.50s]  you could. Actually, I don't disagree with what you said. But you're going to miss a very important
[109.50s -> 122.62s]  announcement. Very important coming up here. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you,
[125.22s -> 133.44s]  the nominees are open for the end of the year awards. You find your way over in the discord.
[133.44s -> 137.14s]  There's a channel there is going to be some rules you need to follow.
[137.86s -> 145.04s]  Please submit any clips over the year for new viewers. This is actually we probably should
[145.04s -> 152.96s]  talk about this. So a lot of people here may have joined this community in the last six, 12 months.
[153.52s -> 157.97s]  So let me just break this down if you don't know what we do. At the end of the year,
[158.53s -> 164.74s]  we do an award show for the channel. And it's not just the best things that have happened here. It's
[164.74s -> 171.09s]  also the worst things that have happened here. We're talking best joke and worst joke. We're
[171.09s -> 180.90s]  talking best stream and worst stream. We're talking worst face worst hair. So it's it's usually pretty
[180.90s -> 186.66s]  much you're trying to find some of these things that make sense those categories. There are a
[186.66s -> 191.42s]  couple of new categories this year. Some of you might be really happy to know. For instance,
[192.06s -> 198.88s]  uh, we didn't know whether the title of best or worst, because it makes sense both ways.
[200.69s -> 209.41s]  Best face, no, no, no, best, um, best overdone Boston moment or worst overdone Boston moment.
[210.22s -> 216.18s]  We really didn't know what to call it. It's kind of just best overdone Boston moment. And I'll give
[216.18s -> 223.97s]  you an example. Oh, I got a fucking Starbucks here, dude. Good luck, because I don't even know
[223.97s -> 232.54s]  what you're gonna find. I don't know. There's only like three times this ever happened. I think
[234.74s -> 239.62s]  we literally only know of like three. Who knows? Maybe some of you might find a bunch of them. I
[239.62s -> 247.42s]  don't know. That's the fun with these awards is a lot of them are just kind of horseshit.
[248.22s -> 255.34s]  And trying to figure out what people actually find is part of the fun, right? Like worst
[255.42s -> 260.14s]  Boston overdone moment. It's like, what the fuck are you? What are you talking about?
[261.54s -> 274.27s]  Good luck. Best sound, worst sound. Yep. And yes, some best sounds will be on the worst sound list
[274.27s -> 280.35s]  and some worst sounds will also be on the best sound list. I don't make the rules, except I do.
[280.35s -> 292.32s]  I made all the rules. So follow them. Of course I made the rules. What about the example you just
[292.32s -> 299.30s]  gave? Can we nominate that? Yes, nominations. It's going to be kind of like it was last year. So
[299.30s -> 305.06s]  because this is happening not on New Year's Eve anymore, this is happening on around Christmas
[305.06s -> 312.05s]  time. So it's going to be pulled back a week or two. This show we need to. So I think it was,
[312.05s -> 320.10s]  what was it? December from December, I think like 15th or something last year and forward till we
[320.10s -> 327.57s]  close nominations in a couple of weeks. So we, I think what we need to do is figure out what was
[327.57s -> 334.75s]  the cutoff period last year. I think it was like December 10th last year. So anything December
[334.75s -> 346.94s]  12th or 15th forward, right, is what way you can pull clips from. When are you going to play modded
[346.94s -> 353.04s]  Skyrim? I installed like 150 Skyrim mods and bricked my computer. So I just was like, I just
[353.04s -> 363.76s]  uninstalled everything. You know, it wasn't a virus. It just like a Skyrim just wouldn't open
[363.76s -> 376.99s]  anymore. So I was like, fuck, this is, I don't even know what's wrong. But anyways, yeah. So
[377.71s -> 380.99s]  the pinned message that you just saw in the chat, there is a nominations channel.
[382.26s -> 387.70s]  That's where you go. We have a form after the nominations close, kind of compile everything,
[387.70s -> 394.54s]  kind of vet a bunch of the responses and you will be able to vote as of the second week of December.
[394.54s -> 400.14s]  I would say that we're trying to have submissions close for nominations on the 4th of December,
[401.34s -> 407.74s]  which then you will be able to vote from the 6th or 7th of December all the way till about a day
[407.74s -> 415.50s]  or so before the show. Go check the channel. And if you don't even, again, this was a lot
[415.50s -> 420.46s]  of new people here probably. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go, go skim through some
[420.46s -> 427.62s]  of the previous years. This is the fifth year going on by the way. All right. I don't care.
[427.62s -> 435.09s]  Do a Mario voice. Okay. Hello. Now go nominate something. Okay. I just did that for you. So,
[435.09s -> 439.65s]  you know, go do something for me. Go nominate something. All right. We're going to go back
[439.65s -> 442.93s]  to the McNulty house. We are going to open this right where we left off. We were in the middle
[442.93s -> 450.64s]  of my birthday party. Well, it's not my birthday party, but it was McNulty's birthday party.
[451.44s -> 463.66s]  Invited all of his friends. We're going to continue this saga. I'm ready to go. Oh, by the way,
[464.30s -> 468.62s]  there's a, there's an a hundred thieves video that's on the hundred thieves channel.
[469.81s -> 475.89s]  I was on the JHB show, TBH with JHB. It was pretty fun. It was cool. You want to go check it out?
[476.85s -> 486.77s]  It's on the hundred thieves, uh, YouTube channel. It was a fun time. You didn't answer one question.
[487.49s -> 496.90s]  Yes, I did. I answered like 10. There was like, it was a lot of questions going on.
[500.27s -> 510.40s]  You just lied the whole time. What? No, I didn't. What do you mean lied the whole time?
[511.04s -> 519.92s]  We were talking about our favorite foods and that like AI is, is getting really weird. Isn't it?
[519.92s -> 525.41s]  What do you mean lying and making up? What are you talking about? Do I like pappaginos?
[525.41s -> 531.57s]  Pappaginos is the best chain pizza you could possibly eat. It is the best chain pizza
[532.29s -> 538.90s]  that is, that's available for you to eat. People are saying wrong. Stop it. I I'm telling you right
[538.90s -> 546.37s]  now, pappaginos versus something like Domino's, not even a contest. It's not even close. It's not
[546.45s -> 554.83s]  even fucking close. That piece of sucks. You are so wrong. I can't even believe it.
[555.71s -> 559.71s]  That's dog shit. That's a dog shit take. No, it is not. If those view that are telling me
[559.71s -> 564.91s]  that Domino's is better than pappaginos, one of two things is, is the problem. One,
[564.91s -> 568.75s]  you've never eaten pappaginos because it's mostly a Northeast thing. So you,
[568.75s -> 572.35s]  you were just making it up. Oh, Domino's is better. I've never eaten the other one,
[572.35s -> 578.51s]  but that's fine. The second one is you got pappaginos before and it was at a party and
[578.51s -> 583.87s]  there were 10 pizza boxes lined up in a row and you ended up getting in line to get your slice of
[583.87s -> 589.07s]  pizza an hour and a half after the pizza showed up. So you're like, oh yeah, there's pizza isn't
[589.07s -> 593.79s]  there. And you go in the back and there it is. Okay. There's like the line of pizzas, like six
[593.79s -> 597.87s]  pizzas here. We're all like sharing it. I'm waiting. I've waited an hour to go get a slice.
[598.43s -> 608.14s]  You're going to give me that kind of review, play the game already, play the game. I'm gonna
[608.14s -> 616.93s]  play the game already. Change your pinned tweet. I can't, I can't. That means I have to log on to
[616.93s -> 624.06s]  Twitter. Well, actually I was on Twitter. I retweeted the 100 thieves thing. But anyways,
[625.73s -> 631.49s]  Domino's doesn't even stand a chance. I'm sorry. Pizza Hut, I will say, I don't know, I was stalling
[631.49s -> 636.77s]  for a minute because somebody angered me immensely in this chat by saying that pappaginos was a shitty
[636.77s -> 643.52s]  place. Pizza Hut, stuffed cross pepperoni pizza. You got me there. You do have me there.
[643.52s -> 650.16s]  Every single other item at Pizza Hut is awful. Pizza Hut, stuffed crust pepperoni pizza is
[651.44s -> 658.46s]  S plus. Every single other thing there is bad, but it's worth going there all the time because
[658.46s -> 665.55s]  they have that one item. I feel the same way about Taco Bell. The multi versus panel is still up.
[665.55s -> 680.38s]  Oh, God damn it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Give me a second. Is it really there? It is, isn't it?
[681.02s -> 700.77s]  It is. I'm removing it. I'm taking it off. There it goes. It was posting the link every 15 minutes
[700.77s -> 709.41s]  since that stream. What? I didn't turn it off. It was posting the link every 15 minutes since that
[709.41s -> 718.67s]  stream. What? Hold on. Wait a minute. You're telling me that whatever. It's fine. Hey, hey,
[718.67s -> 722.27s]  Warner Brothers has been really good to me. So it's, I don't know. It's about it. I don't care.
[723.07s -> 728.38s]  That's fine. I don't care. Warner Brothers has been wonderful to me. That's fine.
[729.26s -> 734.06s]  All right. I'm done stalling. I've got my fucking Starbucks trying to give you some ideas. So where
[734.06s -> 738.70s]  you, you know, if you go fucking find something back like last year when I was like fucking talking
[738.70s -> 742.70s]  like this a lot and you can put it in the best overdone fucking Boston accent moment, this could
[742.70s -> 747.02s]  be one of them, except it's not because I'm going to, it's going to be deleted even if you nominate
[747.98s -> 752.53s]  it. Cause I was giving you an example. I'm looking, I actually am looking forward to that
[753.09s -> 760.78s]  category. I can't wait. I can't wait to see. All right, let's go. Yeah. There is worst stream.
[760.78s -> 774.46s]  You can nominate worst stream. Go ahead. Whatever it is. We'll see. We'll see if it wins. What's up?
[774.46s -> 780.90s]  All right. So last thing. Oh, by the way, this was really funny. Actually. You see this up here. I,
[780.90s -> 784.82s]  I was like pissed off because I was like, why does it say that? Why is it doing this?
[785.54s -> 792.16s]  It said, it said like itty bitty German nine eight five. I was like, why does it say that?
[793.34s -> 798.62s]  That's not cool. Why does it say that? I didn't know that they cycle through these
[798.62s -> 803.79s]  jokey things up here. I thought for some reason, I thought somebody was like fucking with me.
[814.70s -> 826.27s]  All right. The last thing we did is people were, I got to, I got to catch this. I got to catch this
[826.27s -> 831.71s]  because I believe we were in the middle of the party and I believe I was about to poison the cake
[832.27s -> 843.55s]  which don't ask me why I was, people were saying like, Oh, poison. Hold on. All right. All right.
[843.55s -> 849.14s]  No, no, no, no. All right. Put it away. I right when I put it away, put it away, put it away,
[849.14s -> 852.50s]  put it away, put it away, put it away. My birthday party can't be ruined yet. Put it away.
[856.64s -> 862.74s]  Why is it lagging so much? No, put it away. How do I put this away? I'm just going to delete it.
[866.64s -> 879.86s]  What is it? My computer's crashing. Why is my computer? It's my PC crashing. There we go. That
[879.86s -> 891.95s]  was weird. I don't want anybody to eat this. It's a 10,000. This is not a $10,000 PC. All right. So
[891.95s -> 900.02s]  no, I don't want anybody to eat this dude. My computer does not like this game right now.
[900.58s -> 915.65s]  Why is it running so bad? All right. How do I hold on? I got to like,
[915.65s -> 922.13s]  I think my games like cash is messed up. Help me. This man wants to punch me and steal my money.
[924.72s -> 931.04s]  Where? Why is this running so bad? I'm not punching anybody.
[931.76s -> 939.10s]  Maybe. All right. I don't want anyone to eat the cake, but I'm going to blow the candles out.
[939.10s -> 960.06s]  All right. It's time to celebrate. Nobody eat this. I just said I hated the organ.
[960.06s -> 977.06s]  You've ruined my birthday party. All right. Well, how do I blow out the candles? Stop, stop,
[977.06s -> 990.26s]  stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. All right. How do I fix this? Just take it out of his hand.
[990.82s -> 1015.87s]  How do I fix this? Okay. We're good. Nobody can eat that cake. I don't want anyone to die right now.
[1015.87s -> 1029.25s]  No, no, no, no, no. Shit. How do I have, how do I get rid of this? Fence the cake in.
[1029.25s -> 1050.26s]  I just want to celebrate the birthday. I don't want anyone to eat it. Make a new cake.
[1050.26s -> 1058.51s]  How do I just get, how do I like do the thing? Blow out the candles. Where the,
[1058.51s -> 1064.19s]  how come I can't blow the candles out? Go away from here. Go away. Don't eat this.
[1064.19s -> 1066.90s]  Whatever. I don't even care. I have to take it from him though,
[1066.90s -> 1077.01s]  because I need to finish the birthday party. I have to delete the cake. Okay.
[1084.86s -> 1104.13s]  All right. So I did it. Why can't I throw it away? Why can't I throw it away? I can't sell it.
[1104.13s -> 1114.96s]  I can't put it in my inventory and I can't sell it. There's no trash. Whoa. What are you doing?
[1114.96s -> 1125.41s]  What's the, isn't there a DJ supposed to be here? Don't touch this cake. Nobody touch this cake.
[1125.41s -> 1158.43s]  No. Do I need a trash? Buy a trash. This is a laundry hamper. Okay. All right. I don't want
[1158.43s -> 1163.31s]  the party to end before the DJ gets here. That's incredibly important. All right. Throw it away.
[1163.31s -> 1175.36s]  What was that? All right. Throw it away. Throw it away. Imagine throw it away. Your birthday
[1175.36s -> 1197.09s]  cake. That's kind of, how do I fix this? Don't eat it. Don't eat it. She has to put it down
[1197.09s -> 1204.62s]  somewhere. Don't eat it standing up. There's no room to sit down, but don't eat it. I thought
[1204.62s -> 1212.24s]  she's going to start taking bites out of it. Okay. Oh, wait, we have a compromise here.
[1212.24s -> 1218.78s]  That's been a compromise. Somebody take one. It's the every road led to this guy taking a piece.
[1226.88s -> 1242.08s]  Nobody got one, right? Get rid of this cake and make, make me a new one. I want just throw it away.
[1242.08s -> 1252.80s]  Okay. You need to stop doing that. All right. Everybody's safe. Leave one. What do you mean?
[1252.80s -> 1268.85s]  I need somebody to make me a birthday cake. Who is that? Somebody make me a cake. Wait, what?
[1270.21s -> 1275.49s]  It's you? What? Wait, you're the, you are the caterer. You just haven't been making any food.
[1275.49s -> 1283.20s]  You've been dancing. They are the caterer. I just hired him again. Okay. Birthday. What?
[1283.20s -> 1301.81s]  What? Wait, did he eat a slice? No, he didn't eat a slice, right? Santa's just fuked. What?
[1303.74s -> 1313.84s]  Oh no. Why did he puke? What happened? I, he did not eat any cake. So what? I just don't get to
[1313.84s -> 1324.34s]  have a birthday party anymore. What? He didn't eat any cake. Oh my God. That was crazy.
[1326.46s -> 1355.90s]  He just like fuked and died. I was so diligent though. I don't know what happened.
[1355.90s -> 1369.62s]  I didn't, there's a grilled cheese on this counter. It's like, dude, now is not the time
[1369.62s -> 1378.67s]  to make a grill. I'm trying. I want to make a birthday cake. Wait, can I, let's see if I can
[1378.67s -> 1390.06s]  bring him back. You're going to bring him back? While you literally just saved my life, words
[1390.06s -> 1396.53s]  cannot begin to describe how grateful I am. I won't forget this. Well, he's still dead.
[1413.90s -> 1455.73s]  Did they? I don't think that's accurate. Why is he still dead? They're a little late. Don't
[1455.73s -> 1469.38s]  get that close. When is it? Okay. Repair this. What? What do you mean? Why am I turning blue?
[1470.34s -> 1477.57s]  What? How do I stop this? I need clothes. How do I put clothes on? How do I put clothes? I'll put
[1477.57s -> 1497.47s]  some clothes on. What are you doing? Okay. There you go. What can? Oh, the caterer is back.
[1500.24s -> 1523.12s]  How are you? No, don't do that yet. I'm not ready. Can you make a cake? Can you finish this cake?
[1523.12s -> 1542.03s]  What are you doing? This scared the shit out of me. All right. Get up, get up, get up, get up.
[1542.03s -> 1564.37s]  Are you going to do it? Actually, I need to blow up my birthday candles. Okay. Um,
[1566.21s -> 1579.76s]  interesting. I know I lean directly like that. All right. So let's just have a conversation for
[1579.76s -> 1591.78s]  a little bit. What's your likes and dislikes? It's annoying. Wait, she's flirty. What?
[1594.02s -> 1611.10s]  Following traits about hot headed. Okay. Um, should I have a single?
[1611.10s -> 1642.27s]  Okay. Married to what? You're married? What is? Oh. What's going on here? You don't like bugs.
[1648.58s -> 1657.17s]  Tell tales of galactic conquest. All right. Well, you want you looking for a funny conversation.
[1661.01s -> 1665.57s]  Uh, let's do, I'll do an impression. That sounds good. Uh, I would not take your phone.
[1665.57s -> 1671.01s]  It's going to be ruined. Your phone is ruined. I don't know why you took it into the hot tub.
[1672.05s -> 1684.82s]  That was really not a good idea. You can tell knock knock jokes. What do I do? I wait. Aren't
[1684.82s -> 1713.39s]  you married? And they're going to ruin everything. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I'll put
[1713.39s -> 1740.27s]  your hand in that. Don't do that. Okay. Can somebody say something? Okay. What? Planning
[1740.27s -> 1743.79s]  for retirement and midlife crisis away. It's the perfect time to start wrapping up those
[1743.79s -> 1755.31s]  lifelong goals. Are you leaving? I didn't even bake my cake. What do I do with all this shit?
[1757.54s -> 1770.35s]  Do I have to sell this stuff? How do I just leave it here? Have you done any of your goals yet?
[1771.79s -> 1779.33s]  We changed to rocket scientist. I'm getting close. I have to read three books in my whole life
[1779.33s -> 1791.74s]  and that'll get there. You just an olive oil cake. I just, I need to blow my birthday candles out.
[1794.10s -> 1800.82s]  Okay. There it is. Nice. Now add birthday candles. If no one's going to be here with me,
[1800.82s -> 1828.43s]  I don't care. I'm doing it. You did it. What senior already wrinkled bellies party. Wait,
[1828.43s -> 1842.98s]  what happened? I got older. Wait, that's what happened. Okay. All right. Can I reverse that?
[1843.62s -> 1850.06s]  How do I reverse that? I did it last time. I don't, I don't remember that happened the last time.
[1850.06s -> 1855.34s]  Did it? I thought it was because the guy, I celebrated it. I didn't know if like blowing
[1855.34s -> 1860.37s]  out the whatever. What are you doing over here? I don't care. What a sloppy fucking,
[1860.37s -> 1870.93s]  actually that looks pretty good. Dude, you made, okay. That's very strange. This is not poisoned,
[1870.93s -> 1885.62s]  right? Am I old? I could just die at any minute now, right? Lord forgot to have a party for his
[1885.62s -> 1907.68s]  birthday. No, I didn't. I want to do that too. Why did I make a tomato sandwich? Why did I make
[1907.68s -> 1914.98s]  this? If I'm just put it away, put it in my inventory. I'll bring things home. These will
[1914.98s -> 1923.07s]  be fine at the house. Oh, he never got the pizza. He wanted to order a pizza. All right. That was
[1923.07s -> 1953.94s]  fun. Time to go home. But first let me go check this out. Wait, burn? Why can I burn these leaves?
[1953.94s -> 1964.46s]  That makes me happy. She's not going to light on fire, right? I thought he was afraid of fire.
[1968.29s -> 1995.10s]  Play with? What do you mean play with? What am I doing? Why am I doing this?
[2002.19s -> 2026.10s]  You're feeding the fire. Why is she still doing this here? Let's get this shit out of me.
[2038.35s -> 2044.91s]  I think we're all right. It's cold out. It's chilly. Yeah. Let's talk about the weather.
[2045.31s -> 2047.79s]  Uh, I got it. I got a cake over here.
[2060.69s -> 2064.45s]  All right. Well, I had apparently two birthdays. I, I'm not going back.

[2181.47s -> 2196.99s]  So why do you care? You're in the perfect state. No, I'm going to rest up. We're going to take care
[2196.99s -> 2208.05s]  of the dog. How are you doing? Daily cap for a lifestyle. I don't even know what that means.

[2217.81s -> 2227.68s]  I haven't slept and I got promoted. All right. There it is. Apprentice inventor. New clothes
[2227.68s -> 2237.14s]  and I can do journey to the stars. Why is this person dead? Congratulations on your recent

[2248.16s -> 2255.20s]  Yeah. Can I help you? You, you're here to, you want to see the dog? Why did you just take a selfie
[2255.20s -> 2262.50s]  in my driveway? Um, hello. What do you want? You want to, you want to come take a picture with the
[2262.50s -> 2291.95s]  dog? Wait, does this dog have a friend? So what, what can I do? How can I help you? Okay. I don't
[2291.95s -> 2297.57s]  know why you're here. The dog has a better social life than you. Yeah. This is one of the dog's
[2297.57s -> 2306.05s]  friends. Okay. Well, we need to clean up a little. I'd never said invite in by the way. What if it's
[2306.05s -> 2345.42s]  a vampire? Could be, could it be a vampire? I never invited this person in. Okay. You think
[2345.42s -> 2354.08s]  she's a vampire? I'm drinking a coffee at nine o'clock at night. I haven't slept in two or three
[2354.08s -> 2364.14s]  straight days. Why is this guy still going? All right. So this, this girl just came over the house
[2364.70s -> 2373.47s]  to take a picture with the dog and then to use my computer. All right. There we go. Take a shower.
[2374.19s -> 2389.63s]  Take a thoughtful shower. Okay. Oh my God. This is taking a long time. All right. All right. This is,
[2389.63s -> 2403.49s]  this, this is not a library. Okay. It's time for you to go. This is, this isn't a library. I'm sorry.
[2403.49s -> 2416.83s]  Um, bribe for friendship. No, no. It's time for you to leave. Thanks for coming. Send home. Goodbye.
[2416.83s -> 2446.26s]  Get out of here. What am I doing? Why did I wake up to do this? I'm just looking at the,
[2446.34s -> 2458.83s]  I'm looking at the Christmas decoration. All right. You leave the house. Get out. Why won't
[2458.83s -> 2478.30s]  she leave? I should really get going. Yes. Get out of here. She's been living there.
[2478.94s -> 2492.58s]  What's the matter? What's wrong? You okay? Oh no. What's wrong? We need to go to the vet.
[2492.58s -> 2505.22s]  Everything all right? Where you going? Wanted to get some exercise. Oh, it's okay. I got a, um,
[2505.22s -> 2525.90s]  decent bar. No, wake it up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. No, no, no. Oh no. This is actually
[2525.90s -> 2540.93s]  sad. No, wait. How do I, can I, wait, pause it, pause it, pause it. Hold on a second. No, I wasn't,
[2540.93s -> 2570.53s]  that wasn't, I wasn't ready. I was asleep. Save him. I can't, I can't save the game right now.
[2570.53s -> 2584.96s]  No, it's okay. Okay. Everything's going to fall apart right now. Oh, he was a good dog.
[2584.96s -> 2592.70s]  Look at, look at, she was very happy at the end. That's all right. I'm not going to work today.
[2592.70s -> 2621.31s]  Be serious. Do something. She lived a long life. We're going to put this somewhere. Nice. That's sad.
[2622.03s -> 2641.63s]  Where should we put this? Here. Right here. I'm not, the bed's not going away. Reload? Um, I don't
[2641.63s -> 2657.58s]  think it matters if I reload because I've had, you're watching TV. What is this? Oh, it's the
[2657.66s -> 2666.83s]  taco casserole I made. Bro's got to check on the Cowboys game. I'm going to, let's see if we can
[2666.83s -> 2709.10s]  annoy death out of the house. No, turn this all off. I don't like this. Get rid of this. Adopt a
[2709.10s -> 2738.66s]  cat or something. Ask for advice. Ask for advice about death. That makes sense. Flirty. It's going to
[2738.66s -> 2771.09s]  work. We can't get a word in here. Okay. Gloomy compliment. This is death, right? This is right
[2771.09s -> 2789.39s]  up death. Oh, okay. Well, sad day, but I mean, look at, we're getting older too. Remember you
[2789.39s -> 2809.62s]  can't flush the toilet. That's sad. Oh well. It's too bad. Oh no, the food bowl. You can use,
[2809.62s -> 2833.79s]  go use the computer. There. Look, it's like nothing changed. See, you got your spot.
[2833.79s -> 2838.35s]  Pay your bills. Oh my God. Right. There's no electricity. I can't use the computer.
[2838.35s -> 2853.95s]  How much are the bills? $584. What? All right. Can you turn my lights back on?
[2857.58s -> 2864.82s]  Wait, is geek con right now? I'm not ready for geek con. No, I'm not. I'm not ready for geek con.
[2865.74s -> 2869.90s]  It's, I mean, I guess I could take my mind off things, but I, should I go to geek con?
[2886.02s -> 2893.94s]  Should I? All right. But this is not geek con. This is meet a celebrity. That's not,
[2893.94s -> 2906.69s]  when's geek con? Neighborhood brawl. We do it. We do a purge. I don't understand.
[2906.69s -> 2912.37s]  Neighborhood brawl? That's going to be fucking wild. Okay. Well, I need to make sure I have
[2912.37s -> 2920.05s]  high bars for the neighborhood brawl. Why would we do this? Do that now? It's not until this weekend.
[2920.05s -> 2926.16s]  That's a very strange thing to be invited to. I feel like I'm going to get my ass kicked at this
[2926.16s -> 2935.87s]  event. I'm an old man. All right. No, we missed geek con. I think it was yesterday. I need to prepare
[2935.87s -> 2942.75s]  for a harvest fest. Thanksgiving, right? All right. I need to prepare. Decorate. Brand meal.

[2951.12s -> 2955.36s]  mode. Decorate the house exterior by placing and using the attic stack decoration box. How do I do
[2955.36s -> 2972.40s]  this? I need a, I only have 113 bucks. No, I'm keeping it. That was a stupid telescope. I said
[2972.40s -> 2976.88s]  it's, wait, I have bees. I forgot about the bees. I don't need to get rid of the telescope. I don't
[2976.88s -> 3009.97s]  want it there. So you can see out the window. Okay. I need some harvest. What's it called?
[3010.77s -> 3024.69s]  Harvest fest. What do I do this? Outdoor furniture. Outdoor activities. Which, what do I do?
[3024.69s -> 3048.03s]  Attic. What do I do that? Styled rooms. Where's attic? Search it. Attic stack decoration box. Oh,
[3048.03s -> 3054.11s]  okay. All right. So we need some, uh, some things to do here, which is, what do we got?
[3054.11s -> 3068.08s]  Outdoor activities. Active. Oh, a, what does this have to do with Thanksgiving? A styling station?
[3068.80s -> 3095.71s]  The green one. Oh, and put this outside. Okay. So now I can, will they just be in here? Okay.
[3095.71s -> 3102.08s]  Select holiday decorations. Decorate freezies. Decorate foundation. Decorate. Should I just

[3117.78s -> 3132.40s]  Do you not know where it is? All right, cool. Now let's do, um, foundation. I guess this.
[3135.81s -> 3151.42s]  How's it look? Get it. What are you doing? You don't have to use the bathroom. And wait, am I
[3151.98s -> 3155.20s]  seeing things here? He doesn't have to use the bathroom. Why is he saying he has to use the
[3155.20s -> 3183.33s]  bathroom? Foundation. Come on, do it. Dude, I don't have a foundation. I don't even know what
[3183.33s -> 3190.43s]  this means. Why are these like weird, made up words? I don't even know what that means.
[3190.43s -> 3200.05s]  Like decorate the outside, decorate the, the spandrels? The freezes? What is a freezes?
[3200.05s -> 3204.80s]  The spandrels. I feel like this is just made up words that I've never heard before.
[3204.80s -> 3223.55s]  Eaves? Roof? Siding? What is a spandrel? Just whatever. Just have the thing out the front.
[3224.27s -> 3239.98s]  Just like sniff this. All right. I apparently I don't have any spandrels. What day is it? All
[3239.98s -> 3253.26s]  right. I have some decorations. I need a holiday gnome. Find gnomes around your lot. There's no
[3253.26s -> 3265.90s]  gnomes in my lot. Where there was a gnome. Okay. Well, I don't see any gnomes. Grand meal. A most
[3265.90s -> 3269.90s]  delectable feast awaits stomachs. Growling in anticipation. Make sure someone else
[3269.90s -> 3273.50s]  volunteers to do the dishes. Cook a grand meal. All right. So I need to hire somebody.
[3274.78s -> 3294.14s]  Let's have a party. I got money, right? Let's throw an event tomorrow. All right. Here we go.
[3295.26s -> 3308.00s]  We are throwing a dinner party, right? Yep. Not, don't do it yet. Wait. Oh, wait. It's tomorrow.
[3308.00s -> 3314.62s]  Okay. What time is it right now? Just get my bars up. It's tomorrow. It's tomorrow. He's throwing.
[3314.62s -> 3340.99s]  I didn't do anything. I backed out. Oh, this is sad. Mourn furry buddy. Oh yeah. Yodel died.
[3340.99s -> 3360.54s]  Yodel died. Lived a good life though. Was very happy. Do you have mods? I do have mods. I have
[3360.54s -> 3370.56s]  some crazy mods on. I'm just using them sparingly. Why are you not farting? I don't know. There hasn't
[3370.56s -> 3382.10s]  been a, there hasn't been a pants shit in at least, at least like 10 to 15 minutes of in-game. Oh,
[3382.10s -> 3389.30s]  what's going on here? Losing control. Oh, it's all right. Put on the lullaby music. You'll be
[3389.30s -> 3411.33s]  all right. Take a nap. I don't, stop calling me to ask if you should hang out with somebody.
[3411.97s -> 3424.06s]  You're the do or you don't. Cloud gaze with Jimmy Phipps. Okay. Well, we need to invite Jimmy Phipps
[3424.06s -> 3453.68s]  to the Thanksgiving party tomorrow. All right. Take a nap. I go to bed, man. What are you doing?
[3453.68s -> 3507.70s]  Now he wants retro music. Does this count? Okay. Um, how about you want to listen to music? Yeah.
[3507.70s -> 3514.26s]  I'm listening to music. You'd be getting happier. Play a game. Play Sims forever. Just play a game.
[3514.26s -> 3524.29s]  I hate this guy so much. When he dies, please make someone who isn't explicitly dislikeable.
[3524.85s -> 3537.33s]  You guys are rooting for this guy to die. Why are you guys rooting for this guy to die?
[3539.65s -> 3549.36s]  No, we're, look, we're going to geek con next year and we're going to go to space. What's wrong
[3549.36s -> 3561.12s]  with this guy? This guy sucks. He's fine. Make someone worse. It's fine. All right. It's about
[3561.12s -> 3566.59s]  eight o'clock. Turn this off. All right. Let's get ready for tomorrow. Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
[3566.59s -> 3569.47s]  We're going to have a big Thanksgiving party and I'm going to make sure there's a big
[3569.47s -> 3580.42s]  turkey. That's enough of the computer. Get up please. Here's the bathroom. We've got a
[3580.42s -> 3590.53s]  breakthrough. That's exactly where I would have had one too. All right. Now we need to just take
[3590.53s -> 3602.14s]  a quick shower. Quick shower. Then we need to eat and then I need to go to bed. So let's,
[3602.14s -> 3616.58s]  what do we got? Oh wait, no, I have food in my pocket. Why does this guy have so much food?
[3616.58s -> 3622.77s]  Why does he have so much food in this? Why does he have an old coffee from like a year ago?
[3622.77s -> 3633.84s]  I don't want to eat it. Is this cake fine? Why is the cake spoiled? Well, I'm asleep.
[3636.19s -> 3641.60s]  I made the cake two days ago. All right. We got to get rid of some of this stuff.
[3644.90s -> 3670.51s]  Oh my goodness. Give it a, what do I give? What do I give? What do I give? How about a future cube?
[3670.51s -> 3679.97s]  A pie. Probably a pie. Coffee? Pie? I think pie would be pretty good. Or a toy. Let me say pie.
[3679.97s -> 3700.21s]  Okay. Where did I get this from? What just happened? What? Get this fucking thing out of my
[3700.21s -> 3714.45s]  house. Get this thing out of my house. What? I just got struck by lighting. What just happened?
[3728.53s -> 3736.48s]  I'm not letting him out. I gave him an apple pie and he freaked out and turned off my speaker
[3736.48s -> 3741.70s]  and then struck me with lighting. What is going on with that? No, no, no, no. Oh no. This is bad.
[3741.70s -> 3753.95s]  Okay. Um, you can see. Jeffrey Landgraab is available. How? Why is Jeffrey Landgraab the
[3757.92s -> 3790.96s]  sing together with Jeffrey Landgraab? Where is he? I don't think he's coming.
[3790.96s -> 3802.32s]  All right. I got to clean that. Wait, appease the gnome. Um, I don't know. Toy. Give a toy.
[3802.32s -> 3826.78s]  Stop singing. Give a toy. Do you like? Okay. So you liked that. Okay. Cool. Everything is broken.
[3826.78s -> 3842.14s]  Oh shit. All right. I got to get ready for my party. Hurry up. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[3842.14s -> 3855.30s]  Trash. I need to just replace it. I don't care. Did you break it again? No. Uh, 700 bucks.
[3855.30s -> 3863.28s]  What am I making? Stop making BLTs. What the fuck? What is going on?
[3870.50s -> 3881.66s]  What's okay. Something weird is happening. Just eat your BLT and it's Thanksgiving. Hold on.
[3881.66s -> 3902.19s]  I got to hire a repair person. Okay. Good. What is this now? All right. Thank you. Please come in
[3902.19s -> 3909.06s]  here and help me. I, okay. Let's, I got to invite people over now, right? Bladder, go to the bathroom
[3909.06s -> 3918.24s]  and invite people over. We have to cook a grand meal. How much was that? A hundred bucks. All
[3918.24s -> 3926.46s]  right. That's not bad. All right. Clean up. Uh, eat that. And then I got good hygiene. I'm going
[3926.46s -> 3932.98s]  to take a shower and I'm going to invite everybody over for Thanksgiving. More gnomes. Yeah. They're
[3932.98s -> 3945.73s]  just everywhere. Polish this up. Quick shower. Let's go. Okay. Now I'm going to plan an event.
[3945.73s -> 3955.66s]  I don't have a table. I had another breakthrough. I need a table. Okay. I did the gnome thing.
[3955.66s -> 3961.81s]  Grand meal. Uh, okay. I need a table. Even if it's temporary. I'll sell it immediately after
[3961.81s -> 4014.83s]  the party is over. Table. I don't want to table lamps. Okay. Let's invite some people over.
[4014.83s -> 4024.02s]  Why are you going to bed? All right. It's 1 PM. We got to get this going. All right. Here we go.
[4024.02s -> 4036.67s]  Everybody come hang out. It's time for a Thanksgiving dinner party. Let's go. All right.
[4036.67s -> 4043.58s]  And we're going to do it at my, at the McNulty residence. I'm going to be the host. We're going
[4043.58s -> 4049.58s]  to invite of course, Jeffrey Landgraab. I wanted to do, I wanted to hang out with, uh, where is it?
[4049.58s -> 4066.22s]  Jimmy? Um, what else do I really want here? I hate me. Santa, Santa's dead. You might, I don't know if
[4066.22s -> 4073.63s]  you hear you. I don't know. All right. Caterer. No, the whole point is we're going to make the
[4073.63s -> 4085.63s]  turkey. No, there's no caterer. No caterer. We're making the turkey. That's the whole point. We're
[4085.63s -> 4096.78s]  going to make the food. What is this? Did I invite this person? Why are there random like
[4097.98s -> 4109.89s]  packets on the ground? Come on in. Just throw your coffee on the ground at the beach.
[4109.89s -> 4115.49s]  Come on. What the fuck is that? All right. Welcome everybody. We're going to cook a grand meal.
[4115.49s -> 4131.39s]  Cook a grand meal. We're going to cook a turkey dinner. You guys ready? Come on. Let's go. We
[4131.39s -> 4141.26s]  have to celebrate. Are we going to leave some presents for these gnomes or what? The very weird
[4141.26s -> 4158.21s]  turkey. This is a really boring party. We need some music or something. It's going to be like,
[4158.21s -> 4176.82s]  hold on. Is there something fun we can do in here? Like activities or something fun or I don't know.
[4177.46s -> 4209.02s]  How about a mega cooler? Bird feeder? Do a bonfire. Skeez. No, I don't think so. A bird feeder
[4209.02s -> 4214.78s]  party. I mean, we could just put like a bird feeder in here and just watch. Just open the
[4214.78s -> 4234.51s]  wall of the doors and windows. Will this work? Can a bunch of birds get in the house? Does
[4234.51s -> 4239.55s]  somebody want to help me cook? This is not Thanksgiving. There's like a bunch of people
[4239.55s -> 4243.89s]  cooking. Everyone's like, is somebody bringing something? This is a dinner party. Why did they
[4243.89s -> 4250.61s]  not bring anything? Oh, like Jeffrey's going to bring the casserole. You're going to bring
[4250.61s -> 4255.18s]  the green beans. You're going to bring the mashed potatoes. It's a dinner party. Where's all the
[4255.18s -> 4269.44s]  food? She farted and I left. Can we finish this? Nobody brought anything to the dinner party.
[4270.00s -> 4276.98s]  I mean, even a box of Pop Tarts or something. No one brought anything.
[4276.98s -> 4286.64s]  And I'm just sad over here cooking the whole turkey dinner. Oh my God. I need to finish it.
[4288.24s -> 4290.48s]  Stop. We need to finish that. You have to be a good host.
[4303.78s -> 4309.34s]  Everyone's just crowding over. Everyone's just watching this guy play League.
[4311.90s -> 4316.18s]  They're just all hovering. Stop dancing and finish it.
[4316.58s -> 4332.03s]  Can you finish the slop, please? Give yourself a pep talk.
[4340.75s -> 4345.39s]  Can somebody help me do this? Oh no, this person's coming in to give them some pep talk.
[4345.39s -> 4370.85s]  I wonder what's going to happen. Finish it. Finish the turkey dinner. Stop getting distracted. It's
[4370.85s -> 4386.59s]  just, I don't think he knows what he's doing. Can you move to UFC world or something? We don't
[4386.59s -> 4397.30s]  need you in the Sims world. What? You moved to UFC world? All right. Turkeys in the oven. Everybody
[4397.30s -> 4414.32s]  shut up. Oh, he's pissed because there's no food. Oh, we know he's helping. He's reading
[4414.32s -> 4431.87s]  the instructions. Oh, okay. I get it. Looks good. Almost ready. Do we have any crab? No,
[4431.87s -> 4437.23s]  we don't have any crab. We have a, we have like a 17 pound turkey in here. There's no crab.
[4441.04s -> 4445.68s]  No, there's no seafood. Why do you think there's seafood here? Everyone is stuck. Get out of the
[4445.68s -> 4454.08s]  kitchen. Stop crowding me. There's no seafood. It's only turkey. Oh my, I'm going to punch
[4454.08s -> 4457.84s]  somebody in the face in a second. Get away from me. Get away from me. That's why I can finish.
[4469.26s -> 4484.51s]  They're reading the ingredients. Stop. They're all back seating me. All right. I get, is it ready?

[4517.73s -> 4524.58s]  watermelons? I don't understand what's happening right now. Why do I have watermelons on a plate
[4524.58s -> 4540.24s]  here? What am I making? Why did he stop making the turkey? Okay. What are you going to do with that?
[4541.84s -> 4554.66s]  Right. Okay. And it's a fruit and yogurt parfait. Happy Thanksgiving. Are they all complaining?
[4554.66s -> 4567.47s]  Okay. Good. Season it.
[4575.76s -> 4580.32s]  You would have started cooking this turkey like six hours ago. You wouldn't have started
[4580.32s -> 4586.48s]  when people showed up. Oh, everybody enjoying the fruit and yogurt parfait. Eat up. Thanksgiving is
[4586.48s -> 4599.70s]  here. Everybody come get a slice. Here it is. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Oh, hey, wait,

[4602.82s -> 4607.78s]  of real estate on that plate, right? Oh, come on. Yeah. You're going to pile that. You still got
[4607.78s -> 4634.77s]  a little bit of real estate on there. Dude, do you want to go stargazing? You're all so annoying.
[4634.85s -> 4646.75s]  Oh, thankful spirit. Discuss what you can be thankful for.
[4651.30s -> 4661.76s]  Let's complain about the local youth instead. Here's what I'm thankful for. These kids don't
[4661.76s -> 4667.68s]  even know how to throw footballs anymore. Oh, big bullshit. I could throw a perfect
[4667.68s -> 4696.18s]  spiral when I was younger. Excuse me. What happened? Why am I a rejected gangster? I don't
[4696.18s -> 4707.58s]  understand. Oh, my God, what a mess. Thank you for staying this whole time. Wait, be thankful.
[4708.14s -> 4729.44s]  What are you thankful for? Hector.
[4736.77s -> 4744.62s]  What?
[4749.70s -> 4763.25s]  They're our only friend. I'm not doing it. What? What the hell? You're a disgrace? What did I do?
[4763.25s -> 4822.14s]  Dude, this is a vampire. 100%. 100%. This is a vampire. There's no way that's not a vampire.
[4824.26s -> 4831.79s]  There's no way that's not a vampire. Give me a break. All right. Invite in. Come on in.
[4831.79s -> 4842.00s]  Come on in. I got me and my buddy Hector here. If you're getting thirsty. What? I'm going to
[4842.00s -> 4848.56s]  invite this person in and I'm going to leave. Oh, what? Who are you? Yes, of course. It's
[4848.56s -> 4894.00s]  Thanksgiving. Come on in. Why did I punch this guy? Oh, this has to be a vampire. Lock the bathroom
[4894.00s -> 4924.82s]  door.
[4932.03s -> 4938.99s]  This is a vampire. Did you just show up late to the party?
[4947.62s -> 4960.06s]  I didn't speed that up. I'm staying locked in. Oh, my God. I'm not going anywhere. I'm
[4960.06s -> 4969.58s]  staying locked in. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready though. I'm ready.

[5004.34s -> 5023.65s]  What did he do? He just like held the change up to him and changed his channel. Wait,
[5023.65s -> 5040.83s]  do you live there? Wait, OK, I can leave now. OK, stop doing this. What a mess. Put it away.
[5040.83s -> 5050.42s]  I'm going to eat turkey dinner for like the next six months. Turn this off. What an absolute mess.
[5050.42s -> 5066.88s]  I'm going to put this outside. We put it right here so we can see the birds. OK, what a mess.
[5066.88s -> 5075.90s]  There's some bird seed in there. How come you're still here? That's what I'm going to take. I have
[5075.90s -> 5097.94s]  a gnome in my inventory. OK, I'm never taking him out. OK, birds are coming in. How do I get
[5097.94s -> 5119.73s]  them to leave? OK, this is such a mess. Wait, this is still all right. Put that away. I get to clean
[5119.73s -> 5125.20s]  up. Harvest Fest was awesome. Blorek had a wonderful time and got to do everything he planned to do.
[5125.20s -> 5130.51s]  Nice. All right, we did it. Pease the gnome. No, I'm not doing anything. When I wake up,
[5130.51s -> 5149.52s]  I'll clean up. I'm not doing anything. What am I saying? I'm going to sell the gnome.
[5150.48s -> 5165.38s]  Holy shit. OK, that's 300 bucks. What other shit can I sell? Journey to the Stars. Unlocked at level
[5165.38s -> 5184.82s]  two and a cheese pizza. Where is this? Let me sell the other gnome that's in my actual inventory here.
[5185.54s -> 5205.62s]  I could sell all kinds of stuff now. This thing's rare. I love presents. I don't need that anymore.
[5205.62s -> 5215.42s]  Message in a bottle. Oh, gems? No, those are my Kyber crystals. Why do I have a bunch of people's
[5215.42s -> 5234.27s]  earns? OK, I got some money. When's the community brawl? Tomorrow. OK, tonight is the talent
[5234.27s -> 5246.46s]  showcase. I'm not going to work. Wait, I have to go to work, don't I? Just go to work. Whatever.

[5440.14s -> 5455.06s]  Sign up at the bar. It's time for the talent showcase. Join open mic. Couldn't we have done
[5455.06s -> 5463.49s]  this out indoors? Why are we outside doing this? I would not be in the pool right now.
[5463.49s -> 5468.24s]  I've been signed up for the talent showcase. Use the mic or instrument once it's time
[5468.88s -> 5478.43s]  to get on stage. OK, what's going on right now? Why is there everybody scared of the toilet?
[5486.16s -> 5496.77s]  All right. When did we start the talent show? This person should not be in the pool right now.
[5496.77s -> 5511.81s]  Should I go first? Oh, wait. OK. All right. Let's watch. I can't even hear what they're saying.
[5537.12s -> 5549.63s]  OK, now it's my turn to perform. OK. Should I hire a comedian? Practice acting. It's my turn.
[5549.63s -> 5562.32s]  Get off the stage. It's my turn. Get off the stage. Get off the stage. It's my turn, they said.
[5564.99s -> 5590.30s]  Get out of the way. It's my turn. They just called my name. Here we go. I got nervous.
[5590.30s -> 5614.53s]  This is quite the awful talent show. No one's doing anything. Oh, my God.
[5624.34s -> 5641.06s]  Stop looking at the toilet and get over here. Your name has been called. Practice acting already.
[5643.17s -> 5656.58s]  Do a talent. Play the guitar. Pick up the guitar and care. Oh, do it. No, you're not on stage yet.
[5656.58s -> 5694.96s]  You need to be up there before you do overdrive. Having a bad time. Literally nobody did anything.
[5700.90s -> 5716.06s]  Who am I calling? Someone's going to die. That's a vampire. Wait, that's the vampire that came to the
[5716.06s -> 5741.84s]  house. Take a pretzel. Yeah, nice. What time is it? I missed the spicy festival for this
[5741.84s -> 5761.68s]  bullshit. Everybody was too scared to use it. OK, here we go. Here's somebody. Talent show's over,

[5785.46s -> 5789.06s]  struck by lightning. They're standing really still. They're going to get struck by lightning.
[5789.06s -> 5801.42s]  It's going to hit this person. It's going to hit this lady right now. Someone's getting
[5801.42s -> 5812.94s]  struck by lightning. I'm telling you. Do karaoke. This guy sucks. I can't. I don't like the fact
[5812.94s -> 5818.86s]  that there's a thunderstorm so I won't do it. Wait, what is wrong? Having a really bad time.
[5821.38s -> 5844.66s]  Am I actually going to order? Why am I having such a bad time? What's fun?
[5846.27s -> 5871.92s]  Fortnite? Why am I having such a bad time? Is there anything I can do here that's going to make me
[5871.92s -> 5879.41s]  have fun? Anything. Anything at all. I mean, I'm listening to talk radio apparently. I
[5884.96s -> 5892.75s]  thought there was blood all over her hands. Having any fun. Do anything. Is there like a TV

[6001.66s -> 6016.78s]  Why am I having such a bad time? This is unbearable. Why am I, why am I heckling somebody
[6016.78s -> 6059.79s]  at karaoke? Can I scare this person? Shut up. How do I stop you from doing this? Stop talking. Stop it.
[6059.79s -> 6070.06s]  Okay. Good. It's only so long you can take somebody going
[6073.26s -> 6098.26s]  It's like, holy goodness, man. Holy shit. I actually like this guy.
[6110.93s -> 6115.95s]  Where is he? Why can I not pick him? He's not leaving, right? Let's do a duet with the Banthar.

[7136.82s -> 7147.42s]  No one else's neighborhood brawled. Catch me outside. It's time for you to suffer. What?
[7148.14s -> 7158.38s]  I'm sorry, but when you give me this option here that's neighborhood brawl,
[7159.02s -> 7169.44s]  how come nobody's... I go into the gym. I had to turn off the Fortnite shit. Is that death?
[7182.96s -> 7216.42s]  Oh, what else can I even do? I don't want to like hit me. I don't want to hurt anybody. I did.
[7216.42s -> 7222.85s]  Apparently, I still... I was never supposed to do this in the first place because it's too old.
[7222.85s -> 7283.04s]  I'm too old. Whoa. Whoa. What? I'm arrested? How long am I in jail for? Winter. Nobody's clicked
[7283.04s -> 7300.13s]  this. Broke out of jail. That's not what I wanted to do. My God, dude. How does that happen? I don't
[7300.13s -> 7316.34s]  know. Just go home. Just go home at this point. What the hell am I going to do now? Okay. Prison
[7316.34s -> 7351.23s]  break. That's what? So what now? What? By the way, the maid didn't even come and I paid for it.
[7351.23s -> 7383.74s]  Oh, nevermind. You ain't shit. Birds. It's a cardinal. Cool. Okay. So what's coming up next?
[7385.70s -> 7399.95s]  Oh, Winterfest is back. Starlight accolades. What does that mean? I don't know what that is.
[7399.95s -> 7411.10s]  All right. I actually really do need to clean. Ridiculous. Take these decorations down. It's
[7411.10s -> 7436.10s]  over. We're in winter. So how's my career doing? I did four breakthroughs. Okay. As of tomorrow,
[7436.10s -> 7443.94s]  I think I'll be all right. Yeah. Yodel died. Yeah. A couple hours ago. Do life goals, not dreams.
[7443.94s -> 7456.61s]  Okay. I need a logic. Finished reading three books. Just read a logic book. I think I have
[7456.61s -> 7469.47s]  to buy a book, right? I need logic. Logic two, right? Logic volume two. Let's go ahead and read
[7469.47s -> 7489.39s]  that. I'll read logic volume two. Pretty sick. Need to read a couple books. Is that working?
[7492.37s -> 7517.98s]  Oh, I don't care. Why won't I finish the book? I need volume three. What? Are you serious? 250
[7517.98s -> 7539.46s]  bucks. Are you kidding me? Why not? Why? Because I punched the, punched that guy in the stomach.
[7539.46s -> 7549.47s]  Why can't I read this? And I had, there's somebody coming. Can I cancel the maid service?
[7549.47s -> 7567.71s]  Because I'm just cleaning up the house. I need volume one. What is this? The festival of youth.
[7567.71s -> 7591.78s]  Ice cream crepes. Blessings and a void critter hunt. This is cool. It's Pokemon Go. You're too
[7591.78s -> 7605.66s]  old. I think I am too old. I'm too old. I am not going to that. I'm not going to that. I'm sorry.
[7605.66s -> 7617.90s]  I just, I don't think, I don't think I can go there. All right. I'm getting rid of this. This
[7617.90s -> 7625.63s]  is just bringing the mood down. Well, good thing I did that and I just paid a service to come and
[7625.63s -> 7636.85s]  clean the house and they're not going to do anything tomorrow. I have to go to work tomorrow
[7636.85s -> 7642.05s]  anyways. We have to do aspirations. I'm not fucking around. I need to finish reading three books. Does
[7642.05s -> 7660.75s]  it matter what the book is? How about Crisis Barn? Does the book matter? Yeah, you get it.
[7660.75s -> 7674.43s]  You get it. I need two more books. Have a child. I'm, guys, I'm like 80. I'm like 85. I have a
[7674.43s -> 7691.33s]  child. What? It's for a different sim. All right. I finished that book. What time is work tomorrow?
[7691.33s -> 7698.72s]  All right. So I got time. I'll get promoted. Adopt, adopt, adopt, adopt. What? No, I'm not going to
[7698.72s -> 7715.26s]  adopt a kid and die. Buy a youth potion. What else am I doing? All right. I need some food.
[7715.90s -> 7727.92s]  I got to get promoted. Check your rewards. I need to own a business too. How do I buy a business?
[7732.27s -> 7751.46s]  Flirty potion. Happy potion. Um, where is it? Speed cleaner. Storm. Wait, potion of youth.
[7752.02s -> 7760.06s]  Drink this to turn back the clock on your sim's current age. Should I drink one of these?
[7760.06s -> 7766.18s]  Oh, I feel like that's going against the natural order here. Do it. No, let him die. Isn't this,
[7766.18s -> 7774.58s]  this is going against the natural order, I think. Do a poll. All right, let's do a poll.
[7776.06s -> 7782.14s]  Do you want me to keep Blorg McNulty around or do you want Blorg, well, let's get this cleared up
[7782.14s -> 7793.76s]  here. Do you want Blorg McNulty to drink the potion of youth? Get a poll up. Yes or no. What
[7793.76s -> 7808.82s]  are you thinking? How do you feel? What do you think? No. I'm seeing a lot of no's. There is a
[7808.82s -> 7820.11s]  lot of no's coming out right now. There's a lot of yeses too though. That's a lot. You guys want this
[7820.11s -> 7834.85s]  guy to fuck off so bad? That's the 75% almost. Dad, we're not doing that. Thanks for voting
[7834.85s -> 7839.89s]  those of you that voted. Um, no, we're not. Should I buy something else though?
[7850.02s -> 7868.58s]  Instant fun. Eh. Eh. All right, I need to read another book. Where am I? I'm gonna need logic
[7868.58s -> 7880.43s]  to go up. Get a cat. We'll see. Let me get my work stuff done. This will be the third book
[7880.43s -> 7902.10s]  and then I can do logic. Where's the dog? Sorry. Get a hamster. There it is.
[7902.74s -> 7910.56s]  All right, now I need one more logic skill and I have an aspiration here. What's up?
[7944.30s -> 7946.46s]  I'm gonna give you a funny gift.
[7952.30s -> 7964.90s]  What is it? Oh, it's just a joke. By the way, if you imagine going over to somebody's house
[7964.90s -> 7973.49s]  and they come to greet you with a plate of Thanksgiving dinner and it's January or it's
[7973.49s -> 7980.66s]  like late December. I don't know if that stuff's still good. We're getting into, it's been like
[7980.66s -> 7986.10s]  two or three weeks. I don't know if you still should be eating Thanksgiving dinner every day.
[7989.66s -> 7990.22s]  Can I get you some?
[7996.03s -> 7997.39s]  No, I could do fucking garlic noodles.
[8009.52s -> 8021.28s]  All right, I need to get out of here. What book do I get for logic? I'm just gonna get the
[8021.28s -> 8031.90s]  chess table, right? Oh, there's honey in here. How much did I get for this? Are they even still
[8031.90s -> 8054.61s]  here? Jesus, a hundred bucks. What was that? What was that for?
[8061.41s -> 8071.30s]  I'm gonna bond with the bees. This is like so scary. This is a weird guy.
[8084.40s -> 8091.76s]  Oh, I'm like computers.
[8095.06s -> 8100.10s]  Okay, that can't make the bees do anything.
[8100.10s -> 8145.38s]  I need to go to bed. Thanks for going. Why does everybody use my computer? They come over and use
[8145.38s -> 8163.52s]  the computer and they sit here all night. I thought she got in the bed. Okay, so what's
[8163.52s -> 8170.98s]  coming up here? I want to make sure that I have 10 hours. I can't get logic in 10 hours. I might
[8170.98s -> 8178.85s]  get promoted though because I'm doing all right. I need to be focused. How do I get focused?
[8178.85s -> 8197.07s]  Programming or something, right? Like write research. Okay, that should do pretty good.
[8197.07s -> 8219.62s]  I'm focused? No. Ghost? What? What do you mean ghost? Where? No, no, no, no. Oh, shit. I missed her.
[8219.70s -> 8248.03s]  It's okay. Check inventory for logic. I have volume two. What's the difference between volume
[8248.03s -> 8253.06s]  one, volume two, and volume three? Should I read this? I think I already did this though, didn't I?
[8253.06s -> 8269.01s]  Oh, wait. No, it's working. I'm just gonna make sure I get the point and then I'm not gonna get
[8269.01s -> 8284.10s]  it in time. That's fine. Eat some of the turkey dinner. Who are you talking to eat? All right,
[8284.10s -> 8298.27s]  I'm in a pretty good mood. I think I'll be all right. All right, go to work. Now get out of the
[8298.27s -> 8313.84s]  chat room. Go to work. Out of the chat room. No more chatting. All right, go. Oh, wait, this is
[8313.84s -> 8338.82s]  the cleaning service. Okay. What day is it? How much was this? That was 55 dollars. Wait, I just
[8338.82s -> 8354.46s]  picked just two plates and it was 55 bucks. Shit, it's all right. I'll be back from work in a minute.
[8354.46s -> 8370.58s]  How long am I at work for? It's too long. What's up? Bills have been delivered. Okay, I should be
[8370.58s -> 8377.22s]  able to buy it. I couldn't reach your mailbox but I managed to throw the mail in there. Good luck
[8377.22s -> 8395.84s]  getting it out. What? Somebody in the bin? What do you mean? Somebody in the bin. What do you mean?
[8395.84s -> 8402.06s]  Somebody's in the bin. Oh, you're talking about. No, that's the bees are sleeping right now.
[8402.06s -> 8408.50s]  That is kind of funny. It does look like somebody's just in the box. All right, keep going.
[8412.64s -> 8433.62s]  I want to visit werewolf world. No, I want to go to werewolf world. Let's go light fireworks.
[8435.92s -> 8443.55s]  But I'm too tired. What was in the mailbox? Was it like a screwdriver? What was that?
[8444.82s -> 8449.62s]  All right. Okay. All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's go. All right. Let's go. Let's go.
[8449.62s -> 8465.57s]  Let's go. We just light some fireworks and it's the humor festival. That's fine. I will see. I'll
[8465.57s -> 8487.09s]  see where I can't. It's a hard word to say. Where were you? Okay. I thought this was a
[8487.09s -> 8523.25s]  humor festival. Why are we at like an art gallery? Where are we going? Where am I going? What? What
[8523.25s -> 8556.59s]  was that? What did I just take? I don't have anything. I don't get it. I didn't take anything.
[8556.59s -> 8561.98s]  That's weird. All right. So we're here. Uh, let's why don't we we're supposed to be doing
[8561.98s -> 8574.11s]  like humor and hijinks. Why don't we come over here? Okay. All right. I'm going to join the
[8574.11s -> 8583.82s]  pranksters. Worst party ever. Well, you went into the art gallery. You didn't even go to the party.
[8584.62s -> 8610.24s]  Now I got to light fireworks. We can spray graffiti. Did you even join? Join the pranksters.
[8610.80s -> 8638.13s]  All right. We're going to do some graffiti. This is going to take the entire evening.
[8638.13s -> 8673.38s]  What does it say? We're like, we're like choking. You're going to help. I feel like 10 people
[8673.38s -> 8690.45s]  should be doing this. I need to finish this. I can't, I can't just do it halfway. Right. We've
[8690.45s -> 8710.59s]  got to go watch fireworks. Cool. I got to finish this whole thing. This guy's fucking crazy.
[8712.48s -> 8720.59s]  Okay. So it's not done. It's one o'clock in the morning, dude. The only people that are still
[8720.75s -> 8773.66s]  employees. It's not even close. Do I get anything for this? Painting level three. Wow. Almost done.
[8773.66s -> 8796.16s]  Under like 34 hours and should be done. I think it's good. This person walking around with a knife.
[8796.16s -> 8828.86s]  Finish the painting. Look who it is. Almost done. It's almost done. It's not time for bed.
[8831.47s -> 8860.86s]  Mural art style graffiti. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What's so funny?
[8882.48s -> 8918.02s]  You like it? Okay. I just made it darker. Order food. I was defacing my own graffiti.
[8918.02s -> 8942.26s]  Is anybody going to help me? Oh, the clap woke me up. Okay. Cool. Well, I was that really,
[8942.26s -> 8949.89s]  I guess, I guess it's cool. Yeah. It's, it's there. I did that. All right. I made it. What do we got?
[8949.89s -> 8956.50s]  I'll take some, um, what do we, what am I ordering? What? Whoa. You ain't shit.
[8957.76s -> 8974.91s]  I bought that. Give me those two sausages. I, I bought that. Wait, where am I?
[8976.59s -> 8980.35s]  Did I steal it? No. Okay. I took it from behind the counter.
[8982.27s -> 8988.48s]  You hate shit. What'd you get?
[8988.48s -> 9016.91s]  What's your food? You don't want it?
[9025.47s -> 9031.47s]  Whoa. What's wrong? What?
[9044.74s -> 9048.98s]  No, I'm not going to, no, I'm not. I already have a really terrible reputation. I'm not doing that.
[9048.98s -> 9051.84s]  Our reputation is so, why did they close the stores for five minutes?
[9052.48s -> 9067.97s]  All right. What's this spicy food? All right. Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. I gotta go home.
[9069.17s -> 9081.62s]  Get up. Get up. Wake up. New Year's Eve is tomorrow. I gotta be ready.
[9086.67s -> 9093.84s]  I'm going to werewolf world for New Year's Eve. By the way, I'm just like quitting my job.
[9093.84s -> 9110.37s]  What? I'm retiring. Where is it? Business, right? I'm retired. There it is. Where the hell am I?
[9113.10s -> 9119.66s]  No one plays the holiday events. You know that, right? I want to experience it.
[9123.28s -> 9128.54s]  You have no money? I'll be all right. Why don't you come with me?
[9136.77s -> 9146.02s]  All right. Bathroom. Yeah, I'm going to retire. It's time. Come on. Get some sleep. Get up.
[9146.02s -> 9154.27s]  And then I'm celebrating New Year's Eve. Shit. All right. One more day of work.
[9156.82s -> 9162.26s]  Winterfest is tomorrow. I'm going to a werewolf party. I'm going to a werewolf party tomorrow.
[9162.26s -> 9167.42s]  I'm just going to go find one and we're going to. Well, how am I going to get invited to anything?
[9167.42s -> 9185.42s]  Why can I? I need to get invited to a party. I might not get invited to anything.
[9185.42s -> 9192.02s]  They're enraged. I need the money. They were cool. I'm going to, I'm going to sell them to a
[9192.66s -> 9201.84s]  beekeeper. I just sold them to a beekeeper to take care of them. All right. I got a thousand bucks.
[9202.48s -> 9219.94s]  I'm going to sleep and then it's time for New Year's Eve. Get up early. Pay your bills. I will.
[9220.42s -> 9230.18s]  I got it. Wait till he wakes up. Then we're going to go to werewolf town for New Year's
[9230.18s -> 9244.26s]  Eve and it's going to be awesome. Pay bills. Take a shower. Eat. You can take a bath. Whatever.
[9247.76s -> 9254.85s]  Better mood. Watch TV. We need to clean the fridge out. Clean out the spoiled food and then I'm going
[9254.85s -> 9261.01s]  to make a delicious breakfast. Winterfest. Oh, it is Winterfest. Yeah, I'm going to a werewolf
[9261.09s -> 9286.70s]  Christmas party. Why? Unfulfilled dreams. What are you doing? Oh, a nice yogurt. Okay.
[9286.70s -> 9293.47s]  Eat the yogurt. What's wrong? That's so just trash. Oh, it's because clean. I gotta clean the fridge
[9293.47s -> 9302.64s]  out. Wait, what if I bring a turkey somewhere? All right. I'm going to bring a giant ham dinner,
[9302.64s -> 9307.44s]  a grand breakfast. How about a grand breakfast? I'm going to bring it with me in my inventory to
[9307.44s -> 9327.01s]  werewolf land. Ham dinner, fish dinner, turkey, grand breakfast. With what money? I have 70 bucks.
[9327.49s -> 9339.62s]  Vegetarian safe. What? Oh, it's a tofu turkey. All right. We're doing that. I'm bringing a,
[9339.62s -> 9356.08s]  I'm bringing tofu to a werewolf party. How do you make this? Let's see. Yes. Fun. I'm glad
[9356.08s -> 9377.97s]  you're having a good time. Just finish it. Stop with this dancing. Yummies. I love tofu. Oh my
[9377.97s -> 9396.82s]  God. It's always when he's cooking. Let me guess. Wow. No. All right. Here's the tofu turkey. Um,
[9397.14s -> 9419.74s]  it's dead. Very cool. Here it comes. Yup. Yup. Uh huh. Good. Take it out. Grand meal. I have it.
[9419.74s -> 9430.66s]  I've got it. Oh, is it burnt? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go near it. Don't go near it.
[9430.66s -> 9459.57s]  Call the fire department. This shit is burnt. Fire, please. Oh my God. It smells in here.
[9469.07s -> 9476.21s]  It stinks in here. You didn't even finish. You didn't finish. The house is still on fire.
[9483.06s -> 9509.20s]  Oh my goodness. You're not finishing the job. What are you complaining about? What are you doing?
[9526.53s -> 9536.96s]  Thank you. All right. Let's take this burnt ass turkey and let's go. I just need to pee and then
[9536.96s -> 9545.60s]  we're out of here. I don't have to pee anymore. That's fine. Okay. So I need to take a shower
[9545.60s -> 9566.24s]  quick. All right. Turkey. Sabotage food. Okay. I want to put this away, right? I'm going to put
[9566.24s -> 9574.86s]  it in inventory. Okay. I got my, I got my tofu burnt turkey. I'm ready. I just need it. Okay.
[9574.86s -> 9590.54s]  All right. Let's go to werewolf land and, uh, let's go have a holiday party. So let's travel
[9591.74s -> 9611.01s]  to somebody's party. Okay. I'm just going to go by myself. So where is werewolf land? This one
[9611.09s -> 9625.26s]  here. Moonwood mill. Okay. Library. Bar. Okay. Residence. Where should I go? I just go see if
[9625.26s -> 9649.36s]  somebody, like anybody, does anybody live here? I'm just going to go to the werewolf bar. It is
[9649.36s -> 9684.29s]  holiday season here. There's nobody here. This place sucks. We're going to light this on fire.
[9684.29s -> 9689.02s]  Where's the party?
[9689.02s -> 9734.10s]  What the fuck is this? We're going to go on a mountain climb excursion. Weenie roast. Oh,
[9734.10s -> 9742.48s]  that's not a bad idea. Let's do a weenie roast. I'll be hosting it. Um, everybody's invited.
[9742.48s -> 9761.30s]  Jeffrey Landgraab looks different. This person is still in their costume from the neighborhood
[9761.30s -> 9780.93s]  brawl event. The grill master. Um, that'd be, uh, that'd be you. The grill master. And we're
[9780.93s -> 9791.98s]  doing it right here. Wait, we should go to the, let's go to the Landgraab residence,
[9797.71s -> 9810.58s]  right? Why not? Look at this place. This place is huge. Can I even do it here? I don't think I can
[9810.58s -> 9819.33s]  even do it here. Let's go to the Landgrabs. They probably have Christmas stuff up too.
[9819.33s -> 9846.11s]  There's no campfire. I'm just walking in the front door. We need a campfire. How do I get a campfire?
[9846.11s -> 9858.05s]  It's not a very good weenie roast without a campfire. Check for gifts in the mailbox.
[9860.08s -> 9863.04s]  All right. Let's see if you have anything in the mailbox that I can take.
[9863.12s -> 9878.35s]  Anything delivered? Excuse me? Whoa! What's happening? Somebody's stabbing me. What?
[9878.35s -> 9909.90s]  What happened? What? Cheering. Am I dead? Right when I got a gold bar, I wouldn't even get to have
[9909.90s -> 9929.65s]  my fucking turkey. I'm going down. Everybody is. Wake up. Get up. Wait, where's my, where's that
[9929.65s -> 9937.46s]  poisoned cake? I want you to bury me with my lightsaber. We'll be in the coffin with it.
[9937.46s -> 9969.12s]  I want to be buried with my first order of uniform. What do I do? We need to make a new sim?
[9971.60s -> 9976.24s]  I, dude, did you see what it said up there? It said I took like a 24-garret gold bar out of this
[9976.24s -> 9993.74s]  guy's mailbox. I don't understand why I got stabbed. There's no, there's no autonomous killing.
[9993.74s -> 10009.87s]  It's off. I don't know why that happened. We're making a werewolf. Well, there goes McNulty.
[10013.33s -> 10016.45s]  Everyone say goodbye to Lord McNulty. Now we're making a werewolf.

[10046.19s -> 10052.59s]  werewolf. The sim wants to unleash his inner beast and become a werewolf. He seems to get
[10052.59s -> 10061.76s]  an initial relationship boost when introducing themselves to werewolves. Okay. Baking. How's that
[10061.76s -> 10072.02s]  sound? That sounds kind of cool. Fitness. I don't want to make this guy, I don't want to make this
[10072.02s -> 10077.38s]  guy a fucking just complete and total loser, right? Like we have to make this, they got to be cool.

[10106.38s -> 10113.25s]  Not a werewolf. I'm making a werewolf. How about just, um, how about, I don't know, baking?
[10114.05s -> 10132.51s]  How about photography? Now we're doing rock climbing. Oh, I have to, right, right, right,
[10132.51s -> 10144.03s]  right. Okay. Okay. Baking. Fitness. Fishing. Rock climbing and the violin. What do you don't like?

[10151.14s -> 10163.14s]  No lullabies. No kids music. Uh, also you don't like, uh, gardening. You also don't like, um,

[10250.13s -> 10259.12s]  Make a normal guy. I don't want to make a normal guy. How do I make him a werewolf?
[10259.12s -> 10281.38s]  Add to sim. Oh, we're, we're, is it a cult? Werewolf. Oh, okay. Here we go. I mean,
[10282.59s -> 10288.74s]  I can't, can he, he's got to live with this guy. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We have,
[10288.74s -> 10329.58s]  we need, this is going to take a while. Okay. This kind of looks like a guy,
[10330.30s -> 10339.10s]  this is a guy covered in whipped cream. This doesn't look like a werewolf.
[10339.10s -> 10342.14s]  What is this a werewolf? It looks like somebody has a cool whip all over him.
[10345.70s -> 10378.96s]  All right. We're going to keep the cool whip man. Noses. Oh wait. Teeth. Okay. Hold on. Teeth.
[10378.96s -> 10404.11s]  Okay. I want these. I want these for sure. Or these ones. I don't know. Yeah. This is just weird
[10404.11s -> 10415.73s]  looking. All right. I like this. What about ears? You know, when you're in the bubble bath and you
[10415.73s -> 10435.82s]  just do a bubble bath, this is a bubble bath werewolf. Okay. Faces. No, it's perfect the way
[10435.82s -> 10477.04s]  it is. I don't want to change anything. This one is, it's good though, but no, I can't stop doing
[10477.04s -> 10505.04s]  that. Goodness. Okay. What else can we do? Wait, I don't want to add this many things. Oh wait. No,
[10505.04s -> 10514.14s]  I don't, we, I don't want, no, no, no, no, no. Those are cool accessories, but I want to be
[10514.14s -> 10537.50s]  accessory-less. You made Brian Griffin? Okay. But dude, so this is what your human form is.
[10537.50s -> 10543.23s]  If I change anything, will the werewolf form change if I change anything?
[10543.23s -> 10566.82s]  So I can't change this. Okay. Oh shit. All right. Um, unlink them. Oh, there we go. Okay.
[10567.38s -> 10597.38s]  So this is where it is now. And now we can, these eyes need to change. Oh God. I think,
[10597.38s -> 10610.19s]  I think it has to stay. I don't, I don't, I don't think it changes. Maybe let's see what
[10610.19s -> 10637.79s]  the different hair is. It's the, it's the hello neighbor guy. That's good. That's pretty good.
[10638.50s -> 10649.94s]  But the hello neighbor guy would have hair like this. I need, I actually like that. I like that
[10649.94s -> 10688.22s]  a lot. I don't know how much longer I can listen to this. I mean, I need, I need to have, I like,
[10688.22s -> 10815.82s]  okay, this is perfect. Keep it red. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
[10815.82s -> 10820.06s]  All right. We need to do aspirates. Just please stop doing that aspirations. You're a werewolf.
[10820.06s -> 10825.57s]  That's what you want to do. You want to be that your favorite activity is you like baking. You
[10825.57s -> 10831.55s]  don't really like bowling. You like DJs. You like fitness. You like fishing. You like the violin.

[10843.57s -> 10855.76s]  going to do, what did we do before? Adventurous. We're also going to do of the outdoors. We're also
[10855.76s -> 10866.38s]  going to do snob loner. No, anytime you do loner, it's awful because you can never hang out with
[10866.38s -> 10885.14s]  anybody, bro. All right, bro. Okay. I think we're ready. Let's, let's, let's maybe add a cat.
[10885.14s -> 10992.51s]  There's a lot of cats. Cap you. All right. All right. Ears more like a frog than it is a cat.
[10992.51s -> 11045.25s]  Looks like a dog. Fluffy, friendly and a free spirit. All right. I think we're ready.
[11045.25s -> 11082.26s]  Do I, should I just delete this guy? Delete this one? My name is, I don't know, Fred. Um, Anthony,
[11082.90s -> 11124.94s]  Anthony, I don't know, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony butane. He's, I don't worry. Anthony, Billy,

[11264.80s -> 11279.57s]  pictures. I, I do that shit. Is there a picture? Can I have, can I have the cat? How come I never
[11279.57s -> 11290.98s]  get the cat? Whatever. All right. Why is, why is this guy in, why did I not delete this guy?
[11290.98s -> 11296.30s]  Is anybody going to care if I eat this guy in like the first five minutes? Are you going to be mad?
[11303.28s -> 11308.61s]  Uh, wait, where the butane household is moving? Wait, what do we move with the butanes? Wait a
[11308.61s -> 11316.02s]  minute. Um, uh, what's going on on? Oh, there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We want to be here because

[11355.82s -> 11361.18s]  Bro lesson. Jerry is a bro. Bros love watching sports, being around other bros and know how
[11361.18s -> 11367.58s]  to handle their juice. Oh, what's up? Hey, what's up, bro?

[11428.90s -> 11445.78s]  Doors. I need a door for here. Not doing a public bathroom. Does this make sense? Because
[11445.78s -> 11462.51s]  this could be like the kitchen or something. Yeah. I need stuff for the animal. All right. First
[11462.51s -> 11464.99s]  things first. Let's do the light. I got to get that paint, paint, paint, paint, paint. We're

[11551.17s -> 11560.51s]  I'm already building. Delete the house. I'm already building. I'm building. It's too late.
[11561.07s -> 11570.83s]  Well, now I'm into it now. Now I want to do it. All right. So this is, uh, I want a second bedroom.
[11570.83s -> 11576.03s]  No, who cares? Just, I just have two beds or who cares? I have one bed. What? Who cares?

[11583.25s -> 11627.04s]  It's just, I don't like him. I don't like that. Don't put wallpaper. This is a kid's bedroom.
[11629.38s -> 11643.73s]  Put him, like, put him next to each other like this. Somebody said, dude, this is a Burton Ernie
[11643.73s -> 11656.96s]  room. I, it's kind, yeah, whatever. Fine. It's Burton Ernie room. That doesn't, I don't care.
[11656.96s -> 11662.46s]  There's a bookcase in the middle of the Burton Ernie room, isn't there? All right. That's fine.
[11663.02s -> 11677.10s]  Put a lamp in here. They just need to sleep in here and who cares? All right. I just need,
[11677.10s -> 11680.54s]  I'm putting wallpaper up. I'm not going to listen to you weirdos that are saying,
[11680.54s -> 11712.32s]  don't put wallpaper in here. Why? Hey, what about, that's not bad. That's not bad. That's not bad.
[11712.32s -> 11760.72s]  Be a little lighter. Look at this. Okay. Now we need some windows. Look at that. We need some
[11760.72s -> 11783.81s]  doors. So this is the bedroom. This is a, um, it doesn't matter. Whatever. Who cares? Okay.
[11783.81s -> 11793.68s]  I'm not screwing this up this time. So now I need some wallpaper in here and I need some,
[11793.68s -> 11801.65s]  I need the floors. All right. Floor time. We're going to go with something nice. Maybe a little
[11801.65s -> 11834.58s]  bit of carpet. That's cool. Um, sure. And then kitchen. It's that easy. Uh, what about the
[11834.58s -> 11848.53s]  outside? Yeah, it doesn't look good. All right. I need paint for the outside siding. Where is it?
[11862.82s -> 11893.02s]  No, no. It looks like a, like a warehouse. It's a, it's all right. Okay. Now I need a roof. How do
[11893.02s -> 11906.58s]  you do roofs by the way? I don't understand how this works. And like, I just honestly kind of
[11906.58s -> 11926.93s]  don't care because nobody sees it. Nobody sees it. It doesn't matter. You're the only time you're
[11926.93s -> 11935.70s]  ever going to see this is when we're in this menu right now. So no, it doesn't matter. There we go.
[11935.70s -> 11944.10s]  Look at that. It's fine. Oh, we need to have like a little back, uh, area here. Okay. Let's have a,
[11944.10s -> 11975.66s]  go to the outside to get to the backyard. All right. Now we need furniture. Bathroom. We can
[11975.66s -> 11980.14s]  have a piss bush in the bathroom. All right. There's a, you can have, I can have a piss bush.
[11980.14s -> 12000.16s]  Should we go to the bathroom? I mean, I'm a, I'm a werewolf. I am a werewolf. Ooh, I like that.
[12000.16s -> 12018.42s]  I need the walls up. Uh, there's the sink. Now I need a shower. I have to extend this a little
[12018.42s -> 12052.32s]  bit better. A little bit this way. That's better. Hurry up. This is half a game, man. I need a mirror.
[12052.32s -> 12071.87s]  That's in a weird spot. I don't like that. Uh, I need a shower. Just a regular shower. Something
[12071.87s -> 12085.87s]  nice. Spend the money on it. This thing's not bad. This thing's all right. All right. Good. Um,
[12085.87s -> 12092.10s]  bathroom is set. I want, could they actually use this bathroom? Is it a shit bush too? Because
[12092.10s -> 12102.93s]  that's actually pretty funny. All right. I need a litter box. We're going to get the automatic one.
[12102.93s -> 12112.93s]  This one's way more expensive. What's the difference? I think it's way, why is it so expensive?
[12113.49s -> 12130.06s]  Okay. Now I need a couple of toys. Let's do this. Uh, over here. And then I got a cat toy.

[12159.89s -> 12173.10s]  room. Did I not have a couch the entire last person's entire life? It wasn't a couch the entire
[12173.10s -> 12179.31s]  game. The three streams of this game that I've not had a couch. That's it. Okay. That's probably a
[12179.31s -> 12189.57s]  lot of the problem. All right. I'm going to get just something nice. How about the mega sofa?
[12190.13s -> 12202.82s]  Hmm. This thing's pretty nice. Pretty modern. This one's all right. Let's get a, I don't know,

[12246.14s -> 12262.35s]  Why are these so expensive? This is so expensive. Whatever. It's fine. Okay. Now I need just like a
[12262.35s -> 12290.26s]  table. Ooh, that's cool. Let's do this. Right. Or like that console on there. Look at that. I need
[12290.26s -> 12315.79s]  lights. I will. I'll put lights in just wait. Uh, it's like why does this seem so cramped? Now I need
[12316.35s -> 12362.58s]  a big rug. That's big rug. Uh, now I gotta get a painting or something. Get in there. Nothing's
[12362.58s -> 12391.92s]  too big. I don't want that. Um, I got lights in there. Lamp Andy. What? I can't have lamps.
[12391.92s -> 12407.41s]  Everything has to be a recessed lighting. All right. Kitchen time. An expensive ass bridge.
[12407.41s -> 12430.48s]  No, I don't want to go broke. All right. That's fine. There is trash. Perfect placement. There's
[12430.48s -> 12465.01s]  sink. Something nice. This thing is huge. This is just a coffee maker. This thing's fine. That
[12465.01s -> 12469.25s]  thing's also huge. These are so big. How about this little thing? All right. That's fine.
[12470.05s -> 12497.22s]  All right. So I've got, I need a, I need a stove. Oops. All right. I am ready to move. I got a
[12497.22s -> 12513.97s]  counter space. Should I have one more counter? I can get into the fridge still here. Right. Okay.
[12513.97s -> 12537.54s]  That's good. I need a space. Okay. Now I need a table. Oh, cabinets. Yeah. Sure. Why not? This
[12537.54s -> 12561.84s]  is kind of too much. I, yeah. Nevermind. I need the money. Um, anything worth anything here? What?
[12561.84s -> 12578.22s]  I can sell my mailbox. I need a trash can. Okay. Now just a table and I'm done. Just a little one.
[12578.22s -> 12595.95s]  Just something shitty and then a couple of just shitty chairs and I'm fine. That's bad. All right.
[12595.95s -> 12628.19s]  Let's go. How do I turn into a werewolf? Oh, it's winter fest. Right. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. We need
[12628.19s -> 12647.23s]  to light that. It is winter fest. Fest of spirit. Open presents. Grand meal. I mean, we don't,
[12647.23s -> 12662.83s]  we don't know how to cook. I'm crying. Where's the fire alarm? Um, oh, okay. All right.
[12662.83s -> 12667.23s]  Does he know that I'm a werewolf?
[12684.42s -> 12685.22s]  He didn't like that.
[12692.46s -> 12699.95s]  Okay. Um, why can I hear? I can hear them.
[12700.96s -> 12727.38s]  We're going to have to hold on to that for a sec.
[12741.39s -> 12749.25s]  Does Santa actually show up? No, we need to cook a grand meal. I gotta give presents. Here we go.
[12749.25s -> 12755.25s]  Like belly laugh. We have to like, oh, that was funny. We had fun on winter fest.
[12757.33s -> 12762.53s]  Cool. He's in a row. Okay. Now we're going to sing. Let's sing together.
[12768.29s -> 12768.61s]  Okay.
[12780.53s -> 12785.49s]  What about the turkey dinner guy? This is a different character. That other guy got stabbed.
[12801.97s -> 12812.05s]  That's a pretty good Santa. Oh, I need a gift box, right? Pet obsessions. Oh, right. They get
[12812.05s -> 12817.12s]  obsessed with random things. All right. No, no, no. Don't cook. Um, we need to cook a grand. No,
[12817.12s -> 12830.10s]  I don't want Franks and beans. I want a grand holiday meal. We're gonna have a fish dinner.
[12832.26s -> 12838.48s]  I'll take care of it. I'll handle it. We're both going to try to go get this on the same stove.
[12839.76s -> 12856.93s]  Okay. It's so dark in here. What's, what's wrong? Oh, it's a Fortnite dance. I thought
[12856.93s -> 12868.40s]  I thought he was poisoned. Okay. I wanted just to eat that raw. What was it just going to do?
[12868.40s -> 12874.29s]  Oh, right, right, right. I'll give you some more light. All the complaining light Andes here.
[12874.93s -> 12906.30s]  There you go. Look at that. Everybody can see. Wow. There was a cat going to eat this.
[12906.30s -> 12929.33s]  We need to make a grand meal. So gross. What? Where? Already? How does this keep fucking
[12929.33s -> 12937.71s]  happening? What? Help. Put me out. Put me out. Stop playing with the cat. Put me out.
[12943.01s -> 12967.10s]  What the fuck? We're good. Put it out. What are you doing? No, no, no. Call the fire department.
[12967.10s -> 12969.66s]  Call the fire department. Call, call, call, call, call. Get out, out, out, out. Run, run, run, run,
[12969.66s -> 12979.55s]  get out of the way. Where are you? Somebody has to call the fire department. Pick up the phone. How
[12979.55s -> 12987.31s]  do I call the fire department? Why can't I call the fire department? Oh, there it is. Okay. Do it.
[12994.80s -> 13008.62s]  Don't go over to it. Help. Stop standing near the fire. For the love of God. Where's the fire
[13008.62s -> 13019.18s]  department? Come put the fire out over here. I would be very appreciated. It's the whole backyard.
[13019.18s -> 13055.25s]  Help. Thank you. Go get it, please. There's so much fire. There's so much. Who is this?
[13055.25s -> 13085.38s]  Where's the cat? What are you doing in here? He's back. What, what is he doing here? He's back.
[13085.38s -> 13100.78s]  Okay. This fire is still there though. Sniff and introduce? Is that a werewolf thing? I don't
[13100.78s -> 13134.64s]  understand. Wait, what do you mean sniff? This is a different guy. This is a different guy.
[13138.64s -> 13154.61s]  I'm going to find him for presents. How do I turn into a werewolf?
[13184.43s -> 13185.55s]  It is a different person.
[13185.55s -> 13197.25s]  Listen. Holy shit. A knife set?
[13211.63s -> 13235.28s]  What did you do? Why do I hear fire? Oh, thank God. I was going to say.
[13242.24s -> 13265.71s]  I take a wild shower, but I can smash it. What is a wild shower? You need to eat Santa.
[13325.78s -> 13332.46s]  He's still here. I feel like that's kind of mocking. Isn't it?
[13332.94s -> 13340.58s]  Oh, oh, oh, so you are. Get on better term.
[13341.70s -> 13355.44s]  Feed the cat. Oh, it's the automatic feeder. Right. Um, you get up and you do it. Oh,
[13355.44s -> 13387.63s]  Santa. Do you want some, uh, a plate? I love how it's a different guy. I can't get over it.
[13388.35s -> 13392.83s]  Somebody else. Oh, is he leaving? All right. Well, goodbye. Thanks for coming, Santa.
[13393.55s -> 13409.70s]  Well, that was a fun winter fest. One ability. Oh, I have ability points.
[13414.85s -> 13436.13s]  Wolf nap. Territory marking. Okay. Personal grooming. Okay. Wait, hold on. Can I piss on the
[13436.13s -> 13459.50s]  couch?
[13478.10s -> 13485.30s]  How many times can I do this? I can't just do that everywhere, right?
[13489.46s -> 13496.59s]  What's wrong? Why am I glowing? Oh, you want to do a fart off, don't you? You want to do a fart
[13496.59s -> 13526.21s]  off. I got you. Okay. I can't, can't. All right. All right. All right. All right. That's enough.
[13527.41s -> 13571.86s]  Why is it so dark? This is ominous. It is dark out here. Like really dark. I don't know. I can't.
[13571.86s -> 13581.78s]  This was an expensive stove too. That's such bullshit. I don't, I can't replace it.
[13595.02s -> 13604.98s]  Play. I need to take a bath or a shower or something. This is funny. This was funny,
[13604.98s -> 13608.98s]  but it's time to, it's time to buy an actual toilet. I don't, we need to have them be able
[13608.98s -> 13637.60s]  to go to the bathroom. Actual toilet time. Okay. That's better. All right. How are you doing?
[13638.48s -> 13645.44s]  You need to go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. Sad. What an awful holiday.
[13653.17s -> 13663.50s]  How long do you sleep for? Like four hours. That's actually not very much time.
[13664.06s -> 13678.46s]  Still, I have $96. This sucks. What the hell am I supposed to do about this?
[13679.10s -> 13684.66s]  This shit still works. Whatever. Was he gonna have to eat microwave food for a little while?
[13690.48s -> 13696.93s]  Fury. As fury grows, their animalistic instincts begin to manifest and will eventually take over.
[13696.93s -> 13701.76s]  Fury gain is constant and is hastened by Werewolf Ability's full moon
[13702.56s -> 13715.54s]  preferences. Wait, so I, I, I, I turn? All right. Well, you gotta clean this up. What is this?
[13719.12s -> 13729.38s]  Port of potties? Portal potties. Weird. What is this? Okay. Cool. We'll check that out tomorrow.
[13729.94s -> 13755.71s]  Snowing. First snow of the season. Oh, that's cute. You should go to bed. Bert and Ernie.
[13756.59s -> 13790.98s]  Anthony's a bro. All right. Get up. Look at the snow. Get up. Get up. It's snowing up. Look at
[13792.06s -> 13803.89s]  what is going on with my guy. He's supposed to go hollow. Come on. First snow of the season. Let's
[13803.89s -> 13871.63s]  go. Let's go. Coming together. Eating it. Attempts similish communication.
[13880.32s -> 13881.28s]  Pretending to be human.
[13881.84s -> 13915.94s]  Oh, this would be weird. This is weird. This would be very weird. It's at this moment where
[13915.94s -> 13928.85s]  this roommate kind of just goes, how much is for me to break the lease and leave? Come on, dude.
[13930.13s -> 13950.18s]  The beast beckons. What? Wait, he's just, he's lost control. He's kind of just being taken over.
[13950.18s -> 13965.86s]  I don't know how to use a phone. Where's the cat? How is this fridge already broken?
[13965.86s -> 13979.18s]  It's been one day. How is it already broken? What the fuck? It's been one day. He's already
[13979.18s -> 13993.28s]  going back to bed. Why? Awful holiday. Is it because I was licking my hands? That thing's cute.
[13993.84s -> 14016.30s]  Okay. I need to, I need to, what am I doing here? I need to eat something. What? He's going to start
[14016.30s -> 14033.65s]  rampaging. That is not until. Oh my God. Where's he going? Oh my God. He's going to watch out.
[14033.65s -> 14084.85s]  Jerry's transforming. Okay. Are there other werewolves coming over here? I look like I belong
[14084.85s -> 14096.77s]  in a Wallace and Gromit movie. A police cruiser has been dispatched. Oh shit. I definitely did it.
[14097.57s -> 14161.41s]  Oh God. No, are these people? What happened? Wait, what did I do? Why is he dead? Why is he dead?
[14161.41s -> 14205.25s]  Why did that guy die? Whose guts am I ripping out? This guy's not dead. He fell asleep. This
[14205.25s -> 14215.12s]  guy's asleep. He took a book off the shelf. Okay. Well, why, why won't this guy get up?
[14215.12s -> 14277.60s]  It's in regular clothes. Where did I just go? I don't know what's going on here, but you need to
[14277.60s -> 14301.76s]  go home. Okay. Well that was cool, I guess. Where's the house? He got up. He got up. He woke up. He
[14301.76s -> 14363.12s]  woke up. Oh, well that was kind of crazy. Do not save. That was wacky. A helicopter like, I don't
[14363.12s -> 14413.04s]  even know what happened there. Wait, I'm enraged still. How do I stop? How do I stop? Play with a
[14413.04s -> 14424.54s]  silver sword. I don't know what to do. How do I get him to actually, when does he stop doing this?
[14424.54s -> 14443.71s]  Two more hours? Well, all right. Whatever. Good luck. I got points. We'll just hang out in here.
[14446.11s -> 14461.62s]  Just lock him outside. That's actually not a bad idea. All right. Just chill out of there. Bored?
[14461.62s -> 14472.51s]  There's no decorations? All right. Somebody has to get a job and it's definitely not going to be you.
[14472.51s -> 14489.49s]  Why is this person in the house? This guy sucks. Why is this person in the house?
[14515.47s -> 14519.22s]  This guy's a fucking dork. What?
[14522.58s -> 14532.80s]  Why you don't like the cat? Who are these people? They've shown up twice.
[14533.36s -> 14570.94s]  Gary's now a werewolf runt. Oh god, where am I going? I'm chasing this guy down. Werewolf hangouts?
[14570.94s -> 14578.58s]  I can't do any of this stuff.
[14616.72s -> 14644.58s]  Oh, I'm back to normal now. I'm back to normal. Oh no, no, no. That's not happening. We have no
[14644.58s -> 14656.43s]  money. What did I spend up? We've got a stupid plasma screen TV. Just get rid of this. God damn
[14656.51s -> 14664.11s]  it. We have to do this stupid shit again. I have to start over again. I have to start over.
[14665.07s -> 14669.84s]  I have to start over. I have to start over. I'm going to start over. I'm starting over.
[14669.84s -> 14678.94s]  I can't just in the house, right? Wait, why is it you?
[14684.75s -> 14707.95s]  Why did he do that? With a bowl of fucking cereal. With one hand holding a bowl of sausage. What are
[14707.95s -> 14767.04s]  you eating? What is he eating? What is in his hand? He's already what? Excuse me? The car come
[14767.04s -> 14790.21s]  bro. I got to stop. All right. No more. We're not doing any more. We're going to, you're going to
[14790.21s -> 14817.73s]  do your time. We're not, we're just going to relax now. We're going to get, we're going to get a job.
[14817.73s -> 14827.04s]  I don't want all these everywhere. We need to get, I don't want these urns everywhere.
[14827.28s -> 14840.93s]  No, it was cheese crackers is what it was. Clean up. Clean up. We're going to reset back to zero.
[14840.93s -> 14847.47s]  Of course, this fridge is broken already because we had a fire. This all went off the rails
[14848.03s -> 14883.70s]  because of the fire that happened in the first 10 seconds. I actually, I need you. So somebody has
[14883.70s -> 14890.86s]  to repair this. You repair that. I'll repair the coffee maker. TV is fine. I might even just sell
[14890.86s -> 14904.61s]  the TV. Jerry is adventurous. We don't have enough money to do anything. So we need to do this.
[14904.61s -> 14911.15s]  Death, please get out of here. We're going to clean the house. That's fixed. Coffee maker is
[14911.15s -> 14921.70s]  about to be fixed. Things are getting a little better. Clean up. Throw this away. You also,
[14921.70s -> 14934.61s]  you know, clean up a little bit. How's the coffee maker is fine. Okay. Everything looks good. Take
[14934.61s -> 14945.63s]  a shower. You take a shower too. And then we're going to get jobs tomorrow. Oh, maybe one of us
[14945.63s -> 14964.61s]  will. How do you still, why do you still have blood all over you? Oh, there it is. Okay.
[14973.04s -> 14999.33s]  What am I doing? This is worse than my torque. Who is supposed to pay the money though?
[14999.33s -> 15019.09s]  When was I, wait, when did I get electrocuted? We lost $8. How? Oh, cause you're making a coffee.
[15019.09s -> 15054.18s]  This is not working. All right. At least make a salad. Very good. Did you only make one serving?
[15054.18s -> 15066.98s]  Come on, really? You actually don't need to eat. Uh, you go to bed. How much is it? It's 11. Yeah,
[15066.98s -> 15083.65s]  go to bed. I need to shower, use the bathroom and go to bed. No, why would I want to smash?
[15083.65s -> 15116.82s]  So far so good. Werewolves. I hear them. Have a sim do nothing solider for 24 sim hours.
[15116.82s -> 15126.53s]  Really? I feel like we did a lot of stuff. Oh my, look at, look at how cute that is.
[15126.53s -> 15140.10s]  Oh my goodness. It's on the calendar today. Wait, it's New Year's Eve. Oh no, no, that's tomorrow.
[15140.10s -> 15154.16s]  All right. New Year's Eve is tomorrow. We're going to go celebrate. Lunar peace. Oh, all right.
[15154.16s -> 15165.63s]  Both get up. Yeah. You want to have a drink at the club. Okay. Catch a fish. I don't know.
[15165.63s -> 15173.49s]  We're not going to really do that right now. All right. Is there still any salad fridge?
[15173.49s -> 15185.84s]  How about a fruit salad? That sounds good. Go make a salad.
[15186.64s -> 15194.05s]  We got to be ready for New Year's Eve tomorrow. Is there a door open?
[15194.05s -> 15203.52s]  I don't get it. That solves a lot. It solves everything. Yeah. Let's kick stuff. That's fine.
[15203.52s -> 15220.99s]  All right. Prepare for New Year's. Turn this off. I don't want a fire going. Fire is causing so many
[15220.99s -> 15234.06s]  problems. Clean this up too. This is a mess. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that.
[15234.06s -> 15254.72s]  Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that.
[15254.72s -> 15281.87s]  Causes so many problems. Clean this up too. This is a mess. Stop. Don't do that. You don't like
[15281.87s -> 15291.79s]  cooking. That's fine. All right. It's New Year's Eve tomorrow. I don't want any of this stuff. We're
[15291.79s -> 15309.78s]  going to go out anyways. You good? Your passion is baking but you don't like cooking. That is
[15309.78s -> 15334.27s]  really weird. I thought I was a run. Gross. All right. Who's hungry? All right. Just eat it.
[15334.83s -> 15365.58s]  Spend the ability point. I will after eats. Eat first. Why am I doing that? Oh, okay.
[15366.93s -> 15382.00s]  These eyes. How do I do first person? Oh, no. What have I done? This is a HUD-less camera mode.
[15400.75s -> 15423.42s]  This is fucking weird. Will you go sit down? You're freaking me out.
[15430.93s -> 15433.49s]  Sometimes they just do the random dance stuff. I don't know why.
[15438.51s -> 15462.24s]  Okay. Hunter. Wait. We have to buy food. I'm going to go do that right now.
[15463.97s -> 15472.67s]  All right. I'll be back. I'm going to go get his food. You do whatever you need to do. I'm
[15472.67s -> 15501.49s]  going to go hunt for food. Okay. Hunting. Will I get anything? This takes a long time.
[15506.06s -> 15510.26s]  Anthony should have a job. Yeah, Anthony should have a job. You're right. I'll look on my phone.
[15510.26s -> 15521.46s]  Something easy. Something just easy, right? Not a lot of time. Let's see. All right. We can do
[15523.92s -> 15553.06s]  be a critic. This doesn't work, unfortunately. Politician. I'll do critic. Level up writing.
[15553.06s -> 15564.24s]  Yes. All right. So I'm a critic. I work in two days. I need to level up writing. I can do that
[15564.24s -> 15606.80s]  with a computer. You get any food? Make coffee. Did I get any food? Raw meat? Can we cook this?
[15617.73s -> 15648.38s]  Raw what? Well, no, that was a person. Okay. Well, we can make a steak. Are you hungry? You want
[15648.38s -> 15657.44s]  a steak? No, we're good. Why are you so bored? Read your book. Purchase the vampire home,
[15657.44s -> 15665.89s]  whatever this is. This is, we don't have any money. Nevermind. He's so bored Fortnite dancing.
[15666.45s -> 15685.09s]  He was trapped in there. You're going to sleep on the bed? I thought I said raw something,
[15685.09s -> 15691.86s]  but it was actually the name of the person. Sell the TV and buy a PC. That's a good idea.
[15691.86s -> 15739.25s]  They don't need television. It rots your brain. A desk. This is for little kid. I need a PC. This
[15739.25s -> 15754.45s]  thing is all right. This thing's a piece of shit. It's fine. Okay. So, uh, you need to practice
[15754.45s -> 15772.67s]  writing. Practice writing. There it is. And you are, you have the muscle of the operation and you
[15773.71s -> 15779.94s]  are the cool mascot. We've got the brains, we have the muscle and we get the mascot.
[15779.94s -> 15793.60s]  We're good to go. When is New Year's Eve tomorrow? Okay. Let's rest up because we need to make sure
[15793.60s -> 15825.36s]  we celebrate. Can you sell the urn? Weirdo. That's my snowman. Yeah. Get out of here. What was he
[15825.36s -> 15854.93s]  doing? He shows up. He shows up to my property. I can throw snow at Anthony's face. Oh, I'm all
[15854.93s -> 15877.12s]  the way over here. I've got a lucrative opportunity for someone who doesn't ask too many questions.
[15877.12s -> 15906.90s]  I need to do one. I'll take it. I want to shove snow on his face. Stop working. I want to put
[15906.90s -> 15922.58s]  snow on your face. All right. Wait till you get one point. There it is. All right. Okay. That was
[15922.58s -> 15928.64s]  good. You got two points. Uh, we're going to do some mischief here.
[15931.12s -> 15940.54s]  Wash. That's so rude.
[15944.77s -> 15962.34s]  That was so rude. The urn is ugly. Um, what do you want me to do? I can't sell it. Come on.
[15962.34s -> 15977.82s]  Come on. I don't want this 30 FPS. Come on. Come on. Stop it. Stop it. There we go.
[15982.61s -> 15987.62s]  All right. So we, what time is it? Seven o'clock. Let's get ready for bed and let's ready to go out
[15987.62s -> 16000.22s]  and have fun on New Year's Eve. So you need to go to the bathroom. Sure. Why not? Then go to bed.
[16000.86s -> 16016.22s]  What is a feral poop? Doesn't seem very feral. How about you? You need to eat. Uh, I made.
[16017.18s -> 16018.22s]  Yeah, you can eat the leftovers.
[16024.21s -> 16031.50s]  Eat the leftovers. What are you doing? Um, well, you need to cook it first.
[16032.06s -> 16056.56s]  You're just going to eat raw meat. What? You better not throw that away.
[16066.99s -> 16107.76s]  Why is he eating raw steak? There's no stove. Fix that. Stop lagging. It's annoying. All right.
[16111.57s -> 16123.50s]  So we have stove again. Uh, what's wrong with you? Yeah. Go to the bathroom. Cook the steak this time.
[16123.50s -> 16139.50s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
[16139.50s -> 16149.10s]  Stop that. Don't eat the raw meat. Stop doing that. Why is he doing this? Cook it. There's a
[16149.10s -> 16167.38s]  stove. Cook it right. Cook it. You know what? Just eat it. Whatever. He's not a werewolf. He is.
[16167.38s -> 16200.03s]  Go to bed. That snowman's been there for a long time. Carnivore diet. Oh no, you're starting to
[16200.03s -> 16208.70s]  turn. No more of raw meat. What do we do? Would I take a cold shower or bath or something? He's
[16208.70s -> 16216.34s]  doing this thing again. How do we stop it? Oh, he's going hunting. All right. Well, whatever. Fine.
[16216.34s -> 16224.75s]  Bring back some meat. Um, it's almost time for you to get up. Wait, what? He already has it?
[16225.39s -> 16236.21s]  Oh my God. He's got four. No, no, no. We need to cook these steaks. I need to learn how to make a
[16236.21s -> 16250.02s]  steak. These two are fucked. I'm going to eat raw meat at the New Year's Eve party and scare the
[16250.02s -> 16266.96s]  shit out of everybody there. Okay. Uh, how are you on sleep? All right. Get up. Let's get prepared
[16266.96s -> 16277.60s]  for the day. Time for New Year's Eve. Can they cook something? What are you making? Garden salads.
[16277.60s -> 16304.56s]  Not that. Okay. Well, whatever. That's fine. The dancing is making him turn. That's enough of that.
[16304.56s -> 16316.35s]  How do we, how do I calm them down? How do I calm me down? Practice singing or something?
[16329.20s -> 16334.80s]  So bored. All right. New Year's Eve. Let's go. Oh, God damn it. Really? Okay. Well, whatever.
[16334.80s -> 16358.45s]  Should I not take them out? Three hours. What are you doing? We just need to just ride this out
[16358.45s -> 16375.89s]  for another couple of hours. It's going to be fine. Go hunt now. Oh, that's a good idea. I can't.
[16378.94s -> 16381.50s]  No, I can't. I've lost all control currently.
[16386.30s -> 16395.15s]  Don't fuck this whole thing up. Just, I need just six of AM, seven, eight, nine AM, right?
[16395.15s -> 16448.99s]  Do not. This guy. Gary T is the worst character. Are you done? This guy sucks. Eat anything.
[16449.55s -> 16474.82s]  I'm going to eat the coffee machine. Oh my God. What else can I eat? All right. You're coming down.
[16474.82s -> 16483.65s]  Stop peeing. All right. He's coming down. He's coming down. All right. There he goes.
[16485.76s -> 16496.05s]  You ready to go to New Year's Eve? Let's go pee and we'll go. That's such a weird thing because
[16496.05s -> 16506.59s]  this is all official. This is all official Sims 4 shit. That's not a mod. This is the werewolf
[16506.59s -> 16513.44s]  stuff is officially in the game. I almost feel like this is still the mod. It's not. Okay.
[16514.00s -> 16525.95s]  Are we ready? It's time to go to a New Year's Eve party. Where are we going to do it? Countdown to
[16525.95s -> 16530.51s]  midnight decorate party spirit. We're going to go. We have to go somewhere. Where are we going?
[16530.51s -> 16545.01s]  New Year's Eve. Let's plan a social event. Let's go. All right. This is going to be a
[16547.98s -> 16551.42s]  mountain climb excursion on New Year's Eve. We're going to get to the top of the mountain and
[16551.42s -> 16563.30s]  everyone's going to make their resolution on top of the mountain. I only know two people.
[16564.10s -> 16582.82s]  How do we only know two? I've killed people, right? Whatever. This is going to be cool.
[16582.82s -> 16605.63s]  He actually did come with. Wait, he hates me, but he doesn't hate you. He doesn't. All right.
[16605.63s -> 16616.75s]  When did we get to the top of the mountain? Gather excursion members near the trail map
[16616.75s -> 16628.10s]  marker at the top of the climbing route. All right. Where's the climbing route? Over here.
[16628.10s -> 16642.50s]  Okay. Have a sim perform any exercise to warm up. Oh, don't do anything weird. Don't do werewolf
[16642.50s -> 16653.09s]  shit. Stop. Why do I have my clothes off? Oh, okay. Is this also somebody that's going to come with
[16653.09s -> 16665.25s]  us? No, no, no. Don't leave. Oh, you're not leaving. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have
[16665.25s -> 16676.53s]  to go together. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't go without us. We have to go together.
[16676.53s -> 16684.34s]  What are you doing? Don't just go on your own. Okay. I need to do, we need to do an exercise.
[16684.90s -> 16699.26s]  Hurry up. Uh, is it like dog here or something? I don't have anything. All right. Well, whatever.
[16699.26s -> 16708.88s]  Let's go. Okay. Gather excursion members near the trail. Oh, climb up rock wall. Let's go guys.
[16709.76s -> 16739.44s]  Let's check it out. Wrong way. This is a filler episode. Why? How do I get it? Excursion members
[16740.08s -> 16755.60s]  trail map marker at the top of the climbing route. Where is that? This is not canon ride to the top.
[16758.80s -> 16771.86s]  Check the board board. What do you mean? Like in here? God damn it. I want to go on the rock
[16771.86s -> 16785.86s]  climb. The yellow board. You mean this over here? Where's this yellow board you're talking about?
[16785.86s -> 16794.42s]  The yellow board. Where's the yellow board? Who is, who is this?
[16809.89s -> 16819.94s]  All right. We're going up. Ride to the top. All right. Here we go.
[16819.94s -> 16840.78s]  We're going to the top of the mountain. That's who just wiped out. Who just climbed a rock wall?
[16842.13s -> 16886.82s]  I didn't do that. Where is everybody? Where the, where are you going? Santa already got up somehow.
[16886.82s -> 16918.03s]  How did you do that? I need climbing gear. He doesn't have any climbing gear on.
[16918.03s -> 16955.94s]  I need climbing gear from any computer. Hold on. Can I, from here? I definitely can't, right?
[16955.94s -> 16996.38s]  No, I can't reach him. He's saying I can't do it. Santa I think has to pee. I can't reach with
[16996.38s -> 17028.18s]  anything. He's just taunting me. No, I can't do it. How is he going to get down is the question.
[17034.53s -> 17045.70s]  He's so stupid. This is stupid. Santa gets up there with no class. How do I get, what do I do here?
[17045.70s -> 17067.30s]  I guess I could, um, I want to, I just want him to, I'm not going to suffocate him with a diaper.
[17067.30s -> 17077.68s]  I can't reach him. I can't suffocate him with a diaper. With flamethrower. No, he's safe up there.
[17077.68s -> 17109.20s]  I can't do anything about it. Artillery. There's no, I don't have artillery. Drop a meteor, run
[17109.20s -> 17116.56s]  him over. I can't. The group wasn't prepared for the climb. They showed up at the mountain.
[17118.72s -> 17127.04s]  Where did he go? Where did he go? Where's Santa? That was weird.
[17142.18s -> 17166.72s]  He's going. Damn, all right. Well, he made it. He actually made it. I have no idea where Santa went.
[17166.72s -> 17175.46s]  That was bizarre. All right, now we're gonna, I'm gonna ride to the bottom. I just wasn't prepared
[17175.46s -> 17182.13s]  for this apparently. I didn't know you had to have a climbing skill. I guess it's a new skill
[17182.13s -> 17203.54s]  because I was building a meter. Hey, fancy some, um, okay. Pony deserves better than Jerry.
[17203.54s -> 17222.69s]  Let's go get some tea. Okay, so we're all here. Santa here too. All right, so drink tea.
[17226.02s -> 17247.78s]  Where's the, how do I get tea? All right, let's go get Sakura tea. It's right here. Get some swag.
[17248.42s -> 17273.39s]  All right, so what do we want? You didn't even take, you didn't drink your tea.
[17274.11s -> 17288.18s]  We all good? All right, look at how old he is.
[17291.30s -> 17295.38s]  It was just yesterday, I feel like, when I tried to poison you. Here you are.
[17308.72s -> 17311.41s]  Finished the job?
[17318.08s -> 17321.84s]  No, I, no, no, that's not, that's not what we're doing.
[17321.84s -> 17323.68s]  I'm going to drink this tea. We're gonna have a good time.
[17324.16s -> 17339.97s]  Okay, B. I thought I drank the tea. Did I not? Where's my tea? Why can I not get it?
[17341.42s -> 17358.66s]  Drink it. Finally. Jesus. All right, we're good. It's freaking me out. Okay. Why?
[17367.25s -> 17388.06s]  What are you doing over here? So wait, it's almost New Year's, right? We have to sing.
[17388.78s -> 17405.09s]  You think he's gonna like raw meat? Hey, Jeffrey. Brought you something.
[17406.05s -> 17408.45s]  It's a stinky raw steak.
[17412.45s -> 17415.30s]  What?
[17427.15s -> 17438.06s]  I have no idea what just happened. What, what, what was, who was going where?
[17439.63s -> 17442.75s]  I don't understand what I was watching. Oh, that was cool.
[17460.56s -> 17463.82s]  I want to do a New Year's Eve. Let's blow some horns.
[17476.74s -> 17479.06s]  I feel like I'm in VR chat right now.
[17498.83s -> 17502.54s]  Discuss being a werewolf. The metaverse.
[17502.94s -> 17567.42s]  He's his spirit is fading away. Oh my goodness, man. That was a lot into my own piss.
[17571.65s -> 17578.72s]  He made a splashing sound. Um, uh, let's wake up here.
[17593.87s -> 17598.51s]  Is that a big cigar? Oh no. Wait.
[17599.47s -> 17602.19s]  That he's trying to kill a werewolves and vampires.
[17613.76s -> 17616.18s]  I should stay away from this guy.
[17624.06s -> 17634.82s]  I want to see what he says. If I go over there, I'm going to be really werewolfy in front of them.
[17635.46s -> 17641.22s]  Oh, they hate me.
[17676.78s -> 17678.06s]  This is so stupid.
[17678.06s -> 17701.01s]  I'm going to hunt for food right now. Where would I even hunt for food is my question.
[17734.91s -> 17737.63s]  It's kind of hard to move here. I'm having a little bit of trouble moving.
[17744.64s -> 17748.70s]  There's no other werewolves here. That's bullshit.
[17769.42s -> 17774.10s]  I'm going to eat the karaoke machine. I'm going to eat the table that I'm sitting at too.
[17774.10s -> 17802.80s]  The person's a fan. Oh, I destroyed it all.
[17802.80s -> 17836.56s]  Somebody said, please, can you make one sane character?
[17836.56s -> 17846.53s]  I think this character is pretty sane actually. Prime werewolf?
[17846.53s -> 17893.41s]  Oh my God. That's scary. What am I doing? I think everyone's leaving.
[17893.41s -> 17897.95s]  All right. All right. All right. Let's finish this up.
[17905.54s -> 17913.34s]  That lady just put that gun. Oh my, that was awful.
[17914.38s -> 17921.79s]  Where'd the table go? What?
[17924.88s -> 17942.77s]  Where am I? Oh, okay. How you doing?
[17946.83s -> 17952.02s]  Oh, you just did that. You just did that to me.
[17970.38s -> 17971.02s]  All right, we're good.
[17980.13s -> 17984.45s]  Everyone's so sad. It's all about who died. What death? It's all about death.
[17987.25s -> 17988.61s]  Somebody died?
[18009.54s -> 18013.46s]  Well, that's okay. It's the people that I killed. Why did I do that?
[18013.46s -> 18019.36s]  All right. Let's go home. Back to the house.
[18020.38s -> 18022.94s]  That was a wait. We didn't even count down the new year.
[18022.94s -> 18029.76s]  Oh, well, just pretend we did. Just pretend we did. That's fine.
[18046.91s -> 18055.22s]  Jerry ruins the another holiday. Okay. Back here.
[18055.22s -> 18058.54s]  So if you're curious what we're doing tomorrow, tomorrow I'm streaming.
[18058.54s -> 18062.94s]  Tomorrow is obviously Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[18062.94s -> 18066.30s]  Probably going to start the stream a little bit later in the day
[18068.05s -> 18074.11s]  because I figured people will be, you know, eat your turkey,
[18074.11s -> 18077.58s]  have your stuffing and Thanksgiving. And then later on in the evening,
[18078.14s -> 18093.71s]  guess what came out three days ago? Hatsune Miku Picross.
[18093.71s -> 18098.70s]  Hatsune Miku Picross is out. So we're going to chill, eat your food.
[18099.65s -> 18103.44s]  We'll hang out for a few hours tomorrow evening on Thanksgiving.
[18103.44s -> 18108.02s]  It'll be a chill stream. There's been a few wild ones here.
[18108.02s -> 18115.71s]  So chill it out. That's the plan. Are we all in the house?
[18115.71s -> 18116.91s]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Good.
[18116.91s -> 18122.00s]  I'm playing it for a few days. Is it any good?
[18134.26s -> 18135.54s]  I'm not going to the flea market. I don't care.
[18144.46s -> 18146.38s]  Turn this off. I don't like having that there.
[18148.37s -> 18153.97s]  OP. Go on. It's Picross. So it's fun. Cool.
[18153.97s -> 18157.42s]  Does it play music? I would imagine it probably does.
[18161.36s -> 18167.38s]  Oh yeah. Let me just say one more time before I start to cool it out here.
[18167.38s -> 18170.74s]  If you want to nominate something, the end of the year awards,
[18170.74s -> 18174.10s]  nominations are open as of right this very moment.
[18174.10s -> 18178.10s]  Go to the Discord. Go check the nominations channel.
[18178.10s -> 18184.13s]  Read the rules. It's going to be, the nominations are open until December 4th.
[18184.13s -> 18187.06s]  After December 4th, if you don't know what happens here,
[18187.06s -> 18189.14s]  I would go check the previous, the fifth year running.
[18190.82s -> 18194.88s]  Go watch the previous awards, skim through, see kind of what it's all about.
[18194.96s -> 18196.56s]  We do a best and worst of the channel.
[18201.52s -> 18205.12s]  And it will be not on New Year's this year.
[18205.12s -> 18209.44s]  We're doing it in December. Should be a really fun time.
[18209.44s -> 18210.96s]  It's going to be a Christmas special.
[18213.31s -> 18215.63s]  If you have something, if you look at that category's list,
[18215.63s -> 18221.07s]  go look. You might have something to nominate.
[18221.07s -> 18222.27s]  And I'm going to probably call it here.
[18224.10s -> 18232.72s]  I feel like these two characters are, they're just a little too fucked up.
[18232.72s -> 18238.88s]  So I'm probably going to call it here in a second.
[18238.88s -> 18241.04s]  You learn how to make an egg and toast BLT.
[18241.04s -> 18243.07s]  What the hell are you, what is that?
[18243.07s -> 18249.74s]  I'm going to save it though, because we'll come back probably.
[18249.74s -> 18251.98s]  This is, these games are so much fun with the mods.
[18251.98s -> 18256.77s]  It's just, I know that if I have the ability to do this, for instance, like,
[18256.77s -> 18259.84s]  what's one that we didn't see that I want to see?
[18259.84s -> 18267.81s]  There's only those two.
[18277.46s -> 18278.10s]  Steal money.
[18283.23s -> 18285.15s]  No, I'm not clicking on some of these.
[18286.58s -> 18292.86s]  Okay, so what about, I want to look at Deadly.
[18292.86s -> 18294.22s]  Bash head with axe.
[18294.22s -> 18295.18s]  Burn with flamethrower.
[18295.18s -> 18296.22s]  Chainsaw guts.
[18299.33s -> 18302.14s]  Death from above.
[18302.14s -> 18304.19s]  What does this mean?
[18304.19s -> 18305.63s]  I'm going to be on a motorcycle?
[18306.94s -> 18309.76s]  I need to know what this does.
[18309.76s -> 18310.64s]  He's getting out of bed.
[18310.64s -> 18311.04s]  Oh no.
[18331.81s -> 18333.73s]  That was a little elaborate.
[18334.61s -> 18335.89s]  That was a little too much.
[18341.39s -> 18341.89s]  Okay.
[18345.52s -> 18346.40s]  Stop killing Sims.
[18346.40s -> 18352.85s]  I don't have all day.
[18352.85s -> 18353.81s]  I saved it right before.
[18353.81s -> 18354.31s]  Don't worry.
[18366.40s -> 18373.78s]  Lead.
[18373.78s -> 18374.28s]  Come on.
[18379.38s -> 18382.10s]  He's been brought back to life.
[18383.36s -> 18383.86s]  Very cool.
[18427.71s -> 18428.83s]  Brought back again?
[18429.87s -> 18430.83s]  Oh my God.
[18431.55s -> 18434.86s]  He's back.
[18435.76s -> 18436.48s]  We're all good.
[18451.98s -> 18453.58s]  Tombstone Piledriver?
[18453.58s -> 18454.54s]  What is that?
[18454.54s -> 18472.42s]  That is so stupid.
[18472.42s -> 18527.81s]  It plays the music too.
[18527.81s -> 18529.41s]  He's still alive.
[18529.41s -> 18532.98s]  How is he still alive?
[18532.98s -> 18534.18s]  Oh shit.
[18534.18s -> 18534.82s]  Oh shit.
[18534.82s -> 18535.22s]  Quickly.
[18535.22s -> 18535.94s]  Hurry.
[18535.94s -> 18549.57s]  Cat, get out of the way.
[18549.57s -> 18550.69s]  Cat, get out of the way.
[18550.69s -> 18551.81s]  Cat, get out of the way.
[18551.81s -> 18552.93s]  Cat, get out of the way.
[18552.93s -> 18553.73s]  Why am I bald?
[18553.73s -> 18554.85s]  Where's my hair?
[18554.85s -> 18566.48s]  Okay.
[18566.48s -> 18570.29s]  I just want to see.
[18582.37s -> 18594.61s]  Wait.
[18594.61s -> 18597.42s]  Death took my jupe?
[18598.80s -> 18599.92s]  He ripped my...
[18599.92s -> 18608.69s]  What?
[18608.69s -> 18609.97s]  Let's have some raw meat.
[18612.93s -> 18617.79s]  Where's the cat?
[18617.79s -> 18618.83s]  Oh, cat's fine.
[18618.83s -> 18635.58s]  That's been fun.
[18635.58s -> 18651.52s]  We've completely gone off the rails though, unfortunately.
[18651.52s -> 18652.40s]  Thanks for watching everybody.
[18652.40s -> 18657.20s]  That's gonna be it.
[18657.20s -> 18658.48s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[18658.48s -> 18661.17s]  Have a good Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[18661.17s -> 18664.85s]  That was the...
[18697.20s -> 18713.79s]  All right, that's it.
[18713.79s -> 18715.81s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[18715.81s -> 18722.88s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for Miku Picross.
[18722.88s -> 18724.40s]  Probably somewhere around...
[18724.40s -> 18725.73s]  What's a good time?
[18725.73s -> 18730.45s]  Maybe like later in the night?
[18730.45s -> 18732.05s]  Just like a chill night stream?
[18732.05s -> 18736.51s]  I think that sounds like a good idea.
[18736.51s -> 18739.54s]  Maybe like 5, 6 p.m. Pacific?
[18739.54s -> 18740.66s]  6 p.m. Pacific?
[18740.66s -> 18744.18s]  Have like a late night just chill Picross stream for a little bit?
[18744.18s -> 18745.46s]  Line down from Thanksgiving?
[18745.46s -> 18748.69s]  That sounds like a plan to me.
[18748.69s -> 18753.87s]  So see you tomorrow at 6 p.m.
[18753.87s -> 18755.42s]  Late night.
[18755.42s -> 18758.53s]  Thanks everybody for watching.
[18758.53s -> 18760.69s]  Again, this has been The Sims 4.
[18760.69s -> 18761.57s]  We'll probably play it again.
[18763.79s -> 18764.43s]  We just kind of...
[18764.99s -> 18766.11s]  It just went off the rails.
[18766.11s -> 18771.84s]  And actually I'm getting hungry so I'm gonna go eat some food.
[18771.84s -> 18773.12s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[18773.76s -> 18774.80s]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[18774.80s -> 18775.76s]  Have a good one.
[18777.81s -> 18778.31s]  Goodbye.
[18779.26s -> 18779.82s]  Good night.
[18780.38s -> 18782.74s]  Thanks for watching.
[18782.74s -> 18783.46s]  Thanks for the support.
[18785.66s -> 18787.82s]  There were a ton of subs today so thanks guys.
[18787.82s -> 18788.70s]  Appreciate it.
[18788.70s -> 18793.12s]  And we'll see you tomorrow.
[18799.36s -> 18800.32s]  Please play Sorcery.
[18801.70s -> 18803.06s]  What about your internet dropping it?
[18803.06s -> 18804.18s]  Oh, that's a good point.
[18807.76s -> 18808.56s]  It's Picross.
[18809.20s -> 18818.26s]  There's not much going on on the screen.
[18818.26s -> 18821.38s]  Even if I drop some frames it's not very much going on bitrate-wise.
[18822.02s -> 18832.42s]  Sorcery?
[18832.42s -> 18832.98s]  Yes.
[18832.98s -> 18833.22s]  So...
[18833.86s -> 18834.75s]  I don't know.
[18834.75s -> 18837.15s]  We kind of need to figure out what's going to happen with that.
[18837.87s -> 18841.63s]  I did say that I would get into the third game and see if I was still into it.
[18841.63s -> 18842.83s]  See how people are into it.
[18842.83s -> 18848.22s]  Maybe we'll do some just chill late night streams or something.
[18848.22s -> 18848.94s]  Get some of it done.
[18849.66s -> 18856.06s]  Breath of the Wild?
[18856.06s -> 18858.06s]  Oh, we played Breath of the Wild a few days ago.
[18858.70s -> 18859.98s]  I'm still into it.
[18870.75s -> 18872.03s]  Please play more Sorcery.
[18873.87s -> 18875.79s]  What date is the actual award stream?
[18875.79s -> 18877.47s]  I don't have a hard date for you.
[18878.19s -> 18879.79s]  But I can tell you it will be...
[18881.49s -> 18882.69s]  It will be near...
[18882.69s -> 18883.97s]  It'll be before Christmas.
[18884.61s -> 18888.85s]  It'll be at least a few days.
[18888.85s -> 18891.79s]  At least three or four days before Christmas.
[18891.79s -> 18892.67s]  That I can assure you.
[18893.23s -> 18901.42s]  But see you tomorrow.
[18901.42s -> 18902.14s]  Have a good Thanksgiving.
[18902.14s -> 18902.62s]  Good night.
[18902.62s -> 18903.26s]  See you guys later.
[18906.46s -> 18908.22s]  Again, the awards are open.
[18908.22s -> 18909.34s]  Nominations are open.
[18909.34s -> 18911.34s]  If you think that's something you wanted to keep,
[18911.34s -> 18915.26s]  you want to make sure that you made the nomination aware.
[18915.26s -> 18915.66s]  Go do it.
[18915.66s -> 18916.22s]  It's in Discord.
[18916.22s -> 18917.58s]  There's a channel in Discord right now.
[18918.14s -> 18920.43s]  radobeasts.net
[18920.43s -> 18921.55s]  Go check that out too.
[18921.55s -> 18922.51s]  That's very close.
[18923.07s -> 18924.19s]  If you haven't checked it out,
[18924.19s -> 18925.63s]  haven't signed up already,
[18925.63s -> 18929.50s]  it's a great way for us to understand how many units we actually really need.
[18930.46s -> 18931.74s]  radobeasts.net
[18934.27s -> 18935.87s]  End of the year award nominations.
[18936.51s -> 18937.73s]  Christmas show.
[18938.53s -> 18939.17s]  Battleaxe.
[18939.73s -> 18942.38s]  Quite a few things going on in the next month or two.
[18942.38s -> 18944.69s]  So see you soon.
[18945.41s -> 18945.89s]  Take care.
[18946.53s -> 18947.89s]  Have a good rest of your night.
[18947.89s -> 18949.42s]  See you guys later.
[18949.42s -> 19038.98s]  Call your mother.
