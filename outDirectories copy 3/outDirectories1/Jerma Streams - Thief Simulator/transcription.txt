[1.66s -> 9.22s]  How does my headphones... how do they always get so tangled? I don't understand. No matter what I do,
[10.10s -> 18.31s]  I put them down, and then they just end up in like a... looks like a nest, like a sparrow's nest.
[18.31s -> 32.68s]  I don't understand how it happens. So here's the plan for tonight, if you're curious. So we are
[32.68s -> 42.31s]  going to play Thief Simulator for a little while, and who knows? We might... Thief Simulator
[42.31s -> 50.04s]  might be so much fun that we just can't stop playing it. But if it gets to be like an hour
[50.04s -> 56.02s]  or two in and it's like, okay, that's... that's pretty much all there is to this one, then we'll
[56.02s -> 62.90s]  probably end up moving back to Red Dead. Or something else. Because there are a lot of
[62.90s -> 70.23s]  options. There's a ton of things that have come out. So we'll see. To give you guys more of
[70.23s -> 74.23s]  an update on the green screen, the green screen has been officially pushed to Friday.
[76.02s -> 81.14s]  Uh, I figured Thursday is kind of a weird day. I'd rather try to get as many people to be able
[81.14s -> 88.46s]  to watch it as possible. So like Friday night, Friday afternoon, I feel like is the best time.
[88.46s -> 93.32s]  This... the start of the weekend. Because Thursday afternoon is just an odd time, so.
[95.54s -> 102.81s]  So, and speaking of that, speaking of the green screen, I do have something for you to vote
[102.81s -> 111.05s]  on. So, for those of you that missed the... I guess everything we've talked about so far.
[111.93s -> 115.37s]  Well, why don't I just let my intro go for like two or three minutes, you know?
[116.09s -> 120.65s]  Because people are going to be coming in. So, give me two minutes. We'll talk about this
[120.65s -> 191.16s]  when I get back. BRB. So, originally, when I first talked about the green screen, it was,
[191.16s -> 194.60s]  hey, we're going to do the green screen and there's going to be... there's going to be all
[194.60s -> 198.92s]  these voting periods and I'm not going to know what the actions are and it's going to be a secret
[198.92s -> 204.28s]  and a surprise that's not happening anymore. I threw that out last week. So, I went through
[204.28s -> 212.20s]  and I picked from that channel on the Discord a ton of actions. There are so many actions
[212.20s -> 218.28s]  we'll be doing on Friday, but sometimes there's just too many, right? And some of them
[218.36s -> 224.68s]  we're a little on the meme-y side, a little a little on like the internet meme side.
[225.82s -> 232.09s]  And I figured I, you know, I ain't doing a fucking Fortnite dance. I already took that off. So,
[232.73s -> 236.65s]  I don't... that not even available. So, what you're going to vote for on this poll
[238.54s -> 243.18s]  is your favorite one of these fucking memes because you only get... I'm only going to
[243.18s -> 249.85s]  pick the top three. So, you got... you got until like tomorrow or even maybe even tonight.
[252.10s -> 255.30s]  The poll is about to go into the chat and we will sit here and just look at it for a minute.
[257.14s -> 263.43s]  So, here are... and remember, keep this in mind, this is not even a taste of the
[264.49s -> 271.34s]  hundreds of actions that will be happening during this stream. So, there you are. We've
[271.34s -> 281.53s]  got... you got to pick your favorite one out of all those. We've got the Sonic run, the
[281.53s -> 295.16s]  Macarena, do the John Travolta thing, do various CSI sunglasses one-liners, spin around in So Long
[295.16s -> 304.42s]  King Bowers or something, do Infinity War shit, recreate the original Up and Smoke Bee video,
[305.70s -> 313.06s]  Dark Souls praise the sun, and other Dark Souls gestures, and then do JoJo poses.
[315.16s -> 322.81s]  I don't know what that even means. What is do JoJo poses? I don't even know what that is.
[332.73s -> 336.33s]  It's... okay, well, it wasn't a Fortnite dance, so I didn't... should I have vetoed that?
[337.05s -> 347.94s]  This is so one-sided. Why is... why is this so one-sided right now?
[350.94s -> 356.62s]  Veto JoJo's? I didn't... I didn't know what it was. I vetoed Dab, I vetoed default Fortnite
[356.62s -> 361.59s]  dance, and I vetoed re-enact the whole gnome video. I ain't doing... I can't be worse than
[361.59s -> 373.42s]  those. Is it worse than... is it worse than those? I only got three vetoes. Did I fuck
[373.42s -> 387.77s]  myself? Did I just fuck myself over so bad by not vetoing the JoJo poses? Look them up.
[387.77s -> 397.40s]  Well, whatever. So, by the way, the top three... the top three will be brought in because there
[397.40s -> 401.16s]  are so many things. I could just open up the list. You know, I'm gonna open up the list
[402.12s -> 408.17s]  and I'm just gonna read you like two things, okay? Here's a couple of great ones. By the
[408.17s -> 413.70s]  way, I got hundreds of actions. Just make sure you're aware of that. I can't wait to
[413.70s -> 423.99s]  do a full weather report in a suit. That's gonna be fucking fun. Looking forward to act
[423.99s -> 432.60s]  like an alien is bursting out of your chest. That's gonna be a lot of fun. Dude, the Looney
[432.60s -> 440.87s]  Toons outro. That's gonna be fun too. There's so many of these. This is gonna... oh god.
[442.63s -> 448.01s]  So, this... I'm gonna... I'm gonna take a lot of time. I'm gonna do like some rehearsal
[448.01s -> 461.56s]  for this. There's plenty... there's plenty of stuff here. Okay, so do... does that include
[461.56s -> 466.10s]  like the porky pig? Am I gonna have to like put my hands out to the sides and go like,
[467.38s -> 477.85s]  that's all, folks? Is that like what... that's what it is, right? Well, this should be a lot
[477.85s -> 486.06s]  of fun. I can just turn into a stream outro. And, again, let me reiterate this one more
[486.06s -> 490.06s]  time because people... I think I'm confusing a lot of people. And because we're getting,
[490.06s -> 494.46s]  you know, three, four days out, three days out here, let me make sure people are aware
[494.46s -> 497.98s]  of what's going on. Because I feel like a lot of people still have no idea what I'm doing.
[499.14s -> 504.58s]  What is the sonic run? I don't... I don't know. The sonic... when your hands are behind your back
[504.58s -> 511.10s]  and you like run with your head down. What isn't it? Like Naruto? I don't know.
[513.62s -> 520.68s]  Why would that be the sonic run? But whatever. Anyways, after this green screen is filmed,
[521.40s -> 527.48s]  two, maybe three weeks later, depending on how much time I want to... I would say two weeks
[527.48s -> 534.57s]  is good. Two weeks later, this is not a contest, we're going to have a movie night
[535.29s -> 541.83s]  where we watch the shit that you guys made. There will be rules and I will talk about them
[541.83s -> 549.00s]  at great length after the stream is done on what is going to happen. But all of these
[549.00s -> 555.67s]  videos that we'll be watching will be pre-screened. They have to be at least
[555.67s -> 564.74s]  10 seconds long and they have to be no more than two minutes long. So those are the rules.
[564.74s -> 568.58s]  Nobody... there's no contest. There's no like, somebody wins, somebody loses. We're just going
[568.58s -> 577.59s]  to have fun. But we're here. It's time to play Thief Simulator for a little while.
[578.31s -> 585.56s]  Do they have to be school appropriate? Yes, they have to be very appropriate.
[588.60s -> 592.36s]  They have... like you have to be able to be able to like sit down next to your parents
[592.36s -> 605.67s]  and watch these. All right, let me drop this down. That poll will be going till
[605.67s -> 612.20s]  at least tonight. Family movie night. No, it doesn't have to be family friendly per se,
[613.40s -> 618.60s]  but it can't... it can't just... you don't... listen, do I need to spell it out for you?
[620.62s -> 630.14s]  Hold on, let me just get this on here. All right, I'll spell it out for you.
[630.22s -> 643.53s]  No sexual content. No hateful bullshit. Fun. There can be violence. There can be weird shit, but
[643.53s -> 652.33s]  no... none of that bullshit, okay? And it's... they're all going to be pre-screened anyway,
[652.33s -> 665.30s]  so we'll be fine. All right, I'm ready. Anything is sexual to me. What does that even mean?
[670.47s -> 673.83s]  Wait, JoJo poses all sexual? No, they're not.
[677.77s -> 686.63s]  They're not. They're not. And look, we could... we're gonna have fun with it, but
[687.43s -> 698.84s]  you guys... you guys know. You're all... you all understand. Use common sense. You can be stupid,
[698.84s -> 704.74s]  you can be weird, you can be fucking crazy, but just no over the line shit, all right? Like
[704.74s -> 709.94s]  just... you understand. I feel like you guys... you guys... we're all fucking in our 30s here.
[709.94s -> 724.06s]  We're all old enough to know. Why are we stuck at 99? Oh, okay. Is... am I just playing hitman?
[724.06s -> 743.56s]  Is that what this is? It's Vinny. Is that actually Vinny? Hold on, is that... is that Vinny?
[749.08s -> 756.92s]  Oh, wait, hold on. I can't even hear it. Oops. There's no sound. Oops-a-daisy. All right,
[756.92s -> 766.07s]  I need to change some settings here, because wowee. Quality high. Ambient occlusion,
[766.07s -> 775.86s]  I don't want that. And FPS 60 sounds. That's... you just couldn't hear it because I'm an idiot.
[776.95s -> 782.92s]  Any FOV slider? I don't think so. All right, look... I need to like turn that down though.
[784.66s -> 789.30s]  Mouse sensitivity, that's gonna go down. A mouse sensitivity car. This game already became
[789.30s -> 797.24s]  a full letter grade. Is it at least a D already? Okay. No, even more than that.
[800.04s -> 805.93s]  Even more than that. All right, that's fine. All right, pick up the crowbar.
[806.57s -> 812.63s]  Pick up the crowbar. E. Here's Vinny.
[827.56s -> 830.76s]  I don't think that's Vinny. I don't... I'm not sure that that's actually Vinny. All right,
[830.76s -> 839.66s]  inventory. Why does inventory open up my... oh, okay. So, put it in my hand. All right,
[839.74s -> 845.24s]  quick slot. T. You can add items to the quick slot for faster usage. Go to inventory,
[845.24s -> 852.41s]  select an item, and press the quick slot button. Okay, so press the quick slot button. Wait, so...
[853.45s -> 863.83s]  Okay, there it is. So tab is my quick slot. Break the fence. One hit. That's all it took.
[865.62s -> 870.90s]  I got a strike. All right, that's it. Sneaking. Sneaking allows you to make less noise,
[870.90s -> 877.86s]  but will make you slower. Default. C. E. You can also lean by pressing space and left and right.
[877.86s -> 889.93s]  So C, and if I hold space and go like this, I can sneak. Okay, sneak by the window. No,
[889.93s -> 899.53s]  I was about to hit the fence. All right, so I guess you can see the Metal Gear Solid
[899.53s -> 904.82s]  windows down there. Light and visibility. When sneaking around at night, it's best to avoid
[904.82s -> 909.70s]  well-lit places. Your flashlight will also make you easy to spot. So, avoid well-lit
[909.70s -> 920.62s]  places like that. Go through the bushes. Avoid all the light. Vinnie! Hey, some dope left a
[920.62s -> 926.36s]  flashlight on the ground. Take it, but don't let nobody see the light and call the cops.
[927.40s -> 936.33s]  Okay. What's with this 110, 111, one of these addresses? Flashlight. Break the window with
[936.33s -> 951.16s]  the crowbar. So, flashlight is F. Well, that's huge. Wait, this one. Break the window with the
[951.16s -> 962.26s]  crowbar. Lockpicking level four. Glass knife. Interact. So, wait. Okay. Just smash the guy's
[962.26s -> 978.39s]  window. Open the window. How do I go in? Oh. Yeah! What's up, Vinnie? All right. Steal.
[978.47s -> 984.92s]  Take the bed. Flashlight will help you see the loot in the dark. Remember, you're easy to detect
[984.92s -> 996.39s]  with the flashlight on. All right. How do I take the bed? Oh, let's just hide under bed. All
[996.39s -> 1010.86s]  right. So, steal some stuff. Shoes. Open slowly. It's hold E. Is somebody in the house? I don't
[1010.86s -> 1020.94s]  know. I think they're outside. Oh, that's loud. Getting something WD-40 on here. What is it?
[1020.94s -> 1037.34s]  $15. I got it. What else do we got here? Plates. A teapot. 3LD. What the hell? LD. What is it?
[1037.34s -> 1053.98s]  What is LD? 11LD. Pot. Load? Light density? There's nobody even in this house, so I can
[1053.98s -> 1063.50s]  just do it. Toaster. Yep. Time to bail, man. Get in the car. Don't let nobody see you
[1063.50s -> 1083.80s]  with that crowbar. Okay. Take the fry pan. I thought it was not locked. Okay. Unwanted
[1083.80s -> 1088.28s]  attention. Unequip tools and turn off the flashlight to avoid unwanted attention from
[1088.28s -> 1098.65s]  other people. There's somebody in front of me. Is my voice talking? No. All right. Where's
[1098.65s -> 1114.58s]  this car? It's like over here. Can I jump the fence? So, we just have to get in the car.
[1123.29s -> 1136.18s]  I get to drive? How do I turn it on? Oh, God. Drive out of the location. I'm not gonna toot
[1136.18s -> 1155.93s]  the horn. Why would I blow the horn right now? It's a crosswalk! Press space. No, I'm
[1155.93s -> 1160.76s]  not gonna cry. I gotta get out of this tutorial. I can change the camera?
[1166.92s -> 1175.21s]  That's... Okay, the sensitivity is insane right here. That's what that means. Okay. Yep.
[1175.21s -> 1188.76s]  Figured out what that one is. That's why it's great. You're a thief.

[1207.93s -> 1214.94s]  Oh. Good job, man. This just might work. Go get some sleep and we'll pick this up
[1214.94s -> 1225.34s]  in the morning. You actually have a house? So, do I get a better car?
[1227.70s -> 1233.80s]  I can go on the computer! This is cool. Ooh. Simple lockpick. Whatever. I got $42.
[1235.21s -> 1243.02s]  Climbing gloves. Electric lockpick. Jewelry tools. Safe cracking. Glass knife. Hacking tools.

[1268.65s -> 1277.80s]  Oh, alright. I can sell this on the black market. Why would you sell a saucepan on,
[1277.80s -> 1286.39s]  like, the dark web? Yeah, that's right. I got a cast iron pan. I'll sell it to you for
[1286.95s -> 1296.28s]  $10 off what you'd buy it at Walmart. Okay. Now I got more money.

[1309.93s -> 1317.51s]  Lugged in as thug322. This is not... I did not think this game was gonna be this elaborate.
[1317.51s -> 1327.30s]  Okay. So how about, like, simple lockpick? I don't have lockpicking 1. I already have a crowbar. I
[1327.30s -> 1334.76s]  got a flashlight. So I just have to go to bed. There's another computer? Device workshop.

[1871.61s -> 1894.20s]  Really? Okay, come on. Get out. All right, that's fine. Get the TV. Give me the money too.
[1894.76s -> 1921.43s]  Just leave a big shit in his toilet. That's disgusting.
[1924.58s -> 1931.94s]  Oh, there's money down here. TV down. I want that money.
[1933.78s -> 1939.38s]  Yeah, big items. You gotta be put in the trunk before the lady gets here.
[1940.10s -> 1950.62s]  She's about to cross right now. No, she's not. No, I got the back. I'm in the back.
[1958.36s -> 1961.72s]  I'm not going to go to the bathroom in this person's house. Okay, guys, please.
[1962.52s -> 1981.22s]  How do I like get it out there? All right, load up the old TV. All right,
[1981.22s -> 2009.48s]  get it in the trunk. Okay, well, that's one way to do it. All right, I'm ready. Okay,
[2010.12s -> 2018.47s]  uh, steal a TV from loading the car and drive out of here. We're gonna take this road.
[2019.19s -> 2037.80s]  How do I? Where's my home? Am I going just to drive out? Oh, there we go. Home. Road.
[2039.56s -> 2042.84s]  Old TV. You got the key. Remember to spend unused skill points.
[2044.10s -> 2052.92s]  S exclamation point. That's better than S plus. I see you got my screen. Go to black bay.
[2060.98s -> 2069.14s]  All right, I set up a page on there for the TV. Go there and sell it. Okay, electronics. Old TV,
[2069.14s -> 2079.70s]  60 bucks. Yeah, good work. Now click on the rent a thug tab. Now here you can find a little
[2079.70s -> 2088.94s]  extra work. I put one on there just for you. The one with the dishes. Okay, at 110 go break
[2088.94s -> 2096.46s]  their dishes. And that's it. This is the equivalent of if you just shit in the toilet and left.
[2096.46s -> 2108.44s]  That's going to be one eventually, isn't it? Okay, now break the dishes. Okay,
[2109.78s -> 2116.12s]  leaving up a decker at 111. If you don't know what that is, that's when you shit in a water
[2116.12s -> 2134.79s]  tank. You leave it. You have to unlock, you have to unlock the couch shitting quest or break
[2134.87s -> 2147.72s]  the dishes at 1110. We can't even see it. I just wanted to see it. We can't, we don't even get to
[2147.72s -> 2156.07s]  see the damn thing. What the fuck? Did I already do this? Okay, good. Is there just no ragdoll
[2156.07s -> 2169.27s]  or physics engine or something? I mean, I didn't even try. Cell pots and pans. But he told me
[2169.27s -> 2175.59s]  to go to 110 and smash dishes. So I gotta do that first. He didn't even try to swerve. No,
[2175.59s -> 2181.37s]  I was trying to run that person over. I was trying to kill that person because I wanted,
[2181.37s -> 2185.29s]  I just needed to know if we could see anything. All right, so 110 smash.
[2191.27s -> 2212.98s]  I'm dead. I got some dishes to smash. Somebody in this house? Windows locked,
[2212.98s -> 2219.27s]  windows locked. That's not going to stop us. Get in. So now break their dishes.
[2221.05s -> 2231.45s]  I can't even take their toaster or anything. That's my house. No, it's not.
[2243.74s -> 2255.94s]  Is it? So they have, they have physics and breakable plates, but not run overable humans.
[2256.90s -> 2270.02s]  What's up with that? So that's it. This is, what do you got here?
[2271.05s -> 2275.80s]  Deodorant. Any money in the liner? What's wrong with the toilet?
[2276.92s -> 2284.82s]  Okay, well now there's something very wrong with it. Um, all right, well that's it.
[2285.46s -> 2297.82s]  Just gonna get back in the car. Sleep in bed. You can't sleep in bed. All you can do is
[2298.62s -> 2307.50s]  crawl under it. Car. For a second I thought somebody was in the car.
[2311.35s -> 2316.68s]  No, I'm not gonna crawl under it. I already did that. All right, let's leave.
[2317.32s -> 2323.00s]  That is the drive to the edge of the universe here. What's beep?
[2331.64s -> 2335.00s]  Can you even, can you even get in a car accident? You probably can't.
[2340.07s -> 2353.14s]  Cook poop will pre-record it. Wait, hold on. I don't have that.
[2353.14s -> 2380.42s]  I can't even break their mailboxes. Yeah, let's go.
[2394.33s -> 2401.46s]  How is that a C? All right Vinny, give me a call. Learn lockpicking level one.
[2402.94s -> 2417.45s]  Uh, from where, over here. Car. Okay, rent a thug. Let me sell all this shit though.
[2419.77s -> 2426.09s]  Kitchen. Other. Antiques. Art. Uh, this is what they want. Somebody wants this stuff.
[2426.65s -> 2433.14s]  So it's just like here. Okay, skills.
[2433.94s -> 2440.49s]  The skill what is? Lockpicking level one. Open easy locks and lockpicks. Sure thing.
[2441.05s -> 2446.78s]  Notes. Uh, okay. We got some, we got that job done.
[2448.14s -> 2450.70s]  Skills. We just learned lockpicking. Here's Vinny.
[2457.34s -> 2466.54s]  Okay. DIY simple lockpick. I have $230. Got it.
[2498.02s -> 2501.30s]  That's too bad. I was thinking it was gonna just do like seven days.
[2502.58s -> 2508.38s]  It's Jerma's day? What? Okay, let's open it.
[2509.34s -> 2513.66s]  So you need to find the right angle with the bobby pin and then rotate the lock.
[2513.66s -> 2517.98s]  The closer the pin gets to the correct angle, more the lock will rotate.
[2518.78s -> 2529.37s]  So rotate is just D. Okay, so this is just, this is just like fallout.
[2536.26s -> 2545.90s]  Okay. Somebody in jail?
[2545.90s -> 2549.02s]  When close enough you can mark a tenant to discover his daily routines.
[2550.06s -> 2554.14s]  Middle mouse button. Okay, you can also mark cameras to show their viewing angle.
[2554.70s -> 2557.90s]  View range. Check tenant routines in the top right corner. Blue means they are out.
[2557.90s -> 2560.06s]  Tenant routines are also available in the notes menu.
[2560.22s -> 2569.22s]  Okay. So go to 111 around 7 a.m. and mark the tenant.
[2573.14s -> 2581.64s]  So let's give us a little bit of time here. It's 5 a.m.
[2582.36s -> 2587.38s]  I'm really gonna turn off the stereo before I go to bed.
[2590.38s -> 2593.88s]  Sell your stuff? I, I can't. Nobody wants it.
[2596.76s -> 2599.24s]  Missing required items. I can't. The golden goblet.
[2599.80s -> 2604.04s]  Car parts. Electronics. I can't. The kitchen. Go to the pawn shop?
[2605.00s -> 2611.98s]  Yeah, but I'm like a time limit now. I just, I would have woken up at four o'clock in the morning.
[2612.62s -> 2624.70s]  What time is it right now? 5 20 a.m. All right, I gotta make this quick.
[2624.70s -> 2628.76s]  Welcome back. All right, so saucepan.
[2629.80s -> 2634.89s]  That's all I bring into this guy.
[2637.02s -> 2639.58s]  Hey Jeremy. Hey man, what's up? Uh, you got the usual?
[2639.58s -> 2644.30s]  Yeah, I got a couple of toasters, uh, pots and pans, um, in a vase.
[2644.86s -> 2648.20s]  Oh, sweet dude. Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow with the same stuff.
[2648.20s -> 2656.17s]  At what point is this guy gonna hold his hand up and be like, Jeremy,
[2656.17s -> 2659.21s]  Jeremy, you've given me like 30 toasters, man, and nobody buys them.
[2659.85s -> 2665.62s]  Okay, so it's 5 a.m. Just gotta get to 111 around 7 and mark the guy there.
[2666.26s -> 2671.21s]  Is this person in a car or are they walking? Okay, they're walking.
[2671.21s -> 2679.56s]  111 was, it's a three-point turn. You've never seen somebody do that before?
[2680.36s -> 2690.94s]  I just broke the road. The road just crumbled underneath me.
[2691.58s -> 2695.83s]  Okay, so let's get out of the way with his no, out of suspicion.
[2697.80s -> 2704.84s]  I like under the McDonald's heat lamp. That's a great place.
[2706.04s -> 2709.64s]  Right under the light. All right, it's 7 a.m. Okay, I gotta get ready.
[2710.92s -> 2714.94s]  I gotta get a good vantage point up on the seesaw.
[2714.94s -> 2721.10s]  Okay, what time is it? 6 30. He's right there.
[2724.49s -> 2726.33s]  Sleeping in the parking lot.
[2726.33s -> 2730.50s]  Sleep in the car at the parking lot to pass time.
[2734.58s -> 2739.46s]  There's a box in there. Wait for them to leave and get me that box.
[2740.70s -> 2742.22s]  So go sleep, wait for them.
[2742.22s -> 2745.18s]  Okay, hint discovered. Important box inside.
[2745.18s -> 2749.94s]  So what about his routines here? Living room or out?
[2757.03s -> 2758.79s]  I can just sit here and wait, though.
[2758.79s -> 2761.99s]  Wouldn't I rather do it like this or go, no, look at the timer up there.
[2761.99s -> 2764.47s]  He'll be out of the living room.
[2765.11s -> 2772.90s]  He just looked over here. So I gotta sprint in, grab the box.
[2779.34s -> 2781.90s]  I can look at every inch of this guy's entire house.
[2781.90s -> 2784.78s]  I don't even need a camera. I just move back and forth.
[2784.78s -> 2786.94s]  I am the camera. All right, we need like a point of interest, though.
[2789.30s -> 2791.54s]  He's standing up to change the channel on the TV.
[2794.02s -> 2796.90s]  Are you sure he's not using the toaster? He might be.
[2797.62s -> 2811.78s]  So all right, go sleep in my car.
[2814.15s -> 2817.91s]  So it is currently 7 47 a.m.
[2818.71s -> 2826.54s]  So sleep in car. How do I sleep in the car?
[2827.18s -> 2835.70s]  I have to sleep in the trunk? How do I sleep in there?
[2836.34s -> 2841.11s]  Oh, I have to be over there.
[2841.75s -> 2849.00s]  Hey, watch this. What would be the ultimate asshole?
[2849.88s -> 2854.78s]  Ain't nobody parking here.
[2855.50s -> 2860.26s]  All right, let's sleep until 9 a.m.
[2860.90s -> 2865.13s]  That was a good nap. All right, where is he?
[2878.36s -> 2896.81s]  Is he gone? Oh, is that him?
[2914.14s -> 2916.86s]  Oh, I took, I took the most important thing in his whole house, guys.
[2916.86s -> 2924.94s]  I took the TV. How is he going to change the channels now?
[2926.70s -> 2928.38s]  Actually, okay. Hold on. I guess I could.
[2928.38s -> 2929.50s]  He's got barred windows.
[2949.88s -> 2952.92s]  Get me out of here. Oh, I stuck back here.
[2955.08s -> 2956.92s]  How did I wait? Oh, my God.
[2970.89s -> 2972.57s]  Go through. You can't go through.
[2973.37s -> 2983.82s]  Come on. Come on. I want the TV too.
[2983.82s -> 2984.46s]  I'll get them both.
[2989.34s -> 2990.54s]  Come on. Come on. He's still out.
[2990.54s -> 2998.60s]  I'm still good. Hold shift.
[2998.60s -> 2999.88s]  He can't run with the TV.
[2999.88s -> 3008.39s]  I got another item. Important box.
[3008.95s -> 3019.77s]  All right. He's got money. He's got a lot of money.
[3019.77s -> 3021.69s]  Take it. That's a lot of money.
[3021.69s -> 3045.54s]  Where's the box? I made it.
[3055.48s -> 3058.12s]  Every single victim needs to have a smashed toilet.
[3060.62s -> 3064.86s]  No. All right.
[3064.86s -> 3067.50s]  So wait till no one's home to steal the important box.
[3068.06s -> 3077.03s]  How did I not steal the box?
[3077.03s -> 3083.83s]  Box with shady content. That's not it.
[3083.83s -> 3089.78s]  So why is it telling me to still do it?
[3097.56s -> 3099.40s]  Just live. Well, why wouldn't it just say leave?
[3100.22s -> 3107.32s]  I got it. Let's go home first.
[3107.32s -> 3108.44s]  Then I'm going to pawn the TV.
[3112.82s -> 3114.58s]  That's all I want is a B.
[3114.58s -> 3116.18s]  Remember to spend unused skill points.
[3116.18s -> 3118.12s]  I got a B. I'll take it.
[3119.72s -> 3120.92s]  New hints now. Level up.
[3120.92s -> 3122.68s]  So what can I level up?
[3123.40s -> 3130.58s]  This seems like a branching Diablo 2 skill tree here.
[3130.58s -> 3132.10s]  All right. We've got lockpicking level two.
[3136.15s -> 3138.39s]  I need to go from here.
[3139.19s -> 3140.95s]  Open normal locks with a lockpick.
[3141.75s -> 3142.87s]  Open easy locks.
[3142.87s -> 3147.96s]  Okay. Well, now we opened it up.
[3147.96s -> 3148.68s]  More notes.
[3150.90s -> 3155.06s]  So he's out between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
[3156.04s -> 3160.44s]  And he's asleep from 6 a.m. until 11.
[3160.44s -> 3161.16s]  That's not correct.
[3162.57s -> 3164.01s]  There's two people that live in this house.
[3169.66s -> 3172.94s]  Yeah, he's asleep from 5 a.m. to 11.
[3173.02s -> 3176.30s]  And he's out from 9 a.m. to 11.
[3176.30s -> 3177.90s]  Okay. So he sleepwalks.
[3178.54s -> 3180.70s]  He goes and makes eggs at the neighbor's house.
[3182.52s -> 3190.26s]  Okay. Let's go.
[3190.26s -> 3191.46s]  Let's see what I can do here.
[3191.46s -> 3193.14s]  Send the box via Black Bay.
[3193.86s -> 3197.03s]  Just keep taking that guy's TV.
[3198.81s -> 3203.83s]  Okay. We got other box with shady content.
[3203.83s -> 3204.71s]  It's a hundred bucks.
[3205.67s -> 3208.17s]  Okay. Nice.
[3210.49s -> 3211.13s]  What's next?
[3211.13s -> 3215.21s]  The Lombardies think their friend on Greenview needs a new window.
[3216.01s -> 3218.09s]  They think the one they got is fine.
[3219.21s -> 3220.57s]  Go prove them wrong.
[3220.57s -> 3223.69s]  So smash a window in 112 and then hide or run away.
[3224.81s -> 3226.31s]  We got it.
[3229.14s -> 3230.58s]  Smash a window in 112.
[3231.54s -> 3239.02s]  But first, let's see what we can get for this television.
[3247.05s -> 3247.85s]  Welcome back.
[3248.79s -> 3249.35s]  Big item.
[3258.01s -> 3259.93s]  TV. $40 for the TV.
[3260.81s -> 3262.09s]  And another pot.
[3262.09s -> 3264.90s]  I got some money now.
[3265.38s -> 3272.15s]  You wish you thieves were as incompetent as Germo.
[3272.15s -> 3273.43s]  I don't do thievery.
[3274.07s -> 3276.84s]  I don't break into people's houses.
[3277.80s -> 3278.12s]  Of course.
[3278.12s -> 3279.96s]  Why would I be good at something that I don't do?
[3280.68s -> 3284.34s]  Can you believe this guy?
[3284.34s -> 3286.26s]  He can't even perform like a heart surgery.
[3286.26s -> 3288.42s]  I've never fucking performed heart surgery.
[3288.42s -> 3301.26s]  All right. 112.
[3306.44s -> 3307.88s]  Are those two things equatable?
[3309.32s -> 3312.14s]  Because I don't know how to do things.
[3312.14s -> 3313.50s]  I don't know how to do what I've never done.
[3314.30s -> 3316.82s]  I don't know what like a lockpick does.
[3316.82s -> 3318.10s]  I never even touched one.
[3318.10s -> 3319.46s]  I've never held one in my hand.
[3320.42s -> 3327.50s]  Now these ones are up here.
[3328.70s -> 3330.06s]  All right. Let's park it.
[3330.06s -> 3337.77s]  I don't even know what it does.
[3342.73s -> 3344.89s]  Break a window in 112 and hide or run.
[3345.53s -> 3349.67s]  So I'm just like a regular person, right?
[3349.67s -> 3350.79s]  So I don't have to worry about it.
[3350.79s -> 3352.87s]  If they see me, as long as I don't have the crowbar out, I'm fine.
[3353.59s -> 3355.05s]  So this is 112.
[3355.77s -> 3357.85s]  Can I peek? Can I jump?
[3358.65s -> 3365.37s]  You put the lockpick in the thing and rotate the lock.
[3365.37s -> 3366.33s]  That's not how it works.
[3367.29s -> 3385.24s]  I can't climb a fence because I don't have enough agility.
[3385.24s -> 3388.89s]  Okay. Well, is there somebody in the house?
[3389.69s -> 3392.04s]  Can I reach from here?
[3395.61s -> 3396.89s]  Just throw the crowbar in there.
[3405.02s -> 3406.22s]  Is somebody in the house?
[3406.22s -> 3406.94s]  No one's in the house.
[3410.58s -> 3411.08s]  Whoa!
[3421.70s -> 3423.22s]  Just about to rob you.
[3423.22s -> 3424.42s]  All right. I got two people marked.
[3424.42s -> 3425.62s]  They're at the garden.
[3425.62s -> 3427.46s]  They go to the garden now.
[3428.76s -> 3429.56s]  Break their window.
[3429.56s -> 3430.68s]  All right. So I got to break this.
[3430.68s -> 3431.56s]  I'm sprinting right behind me.
[3431.56s -> 3433.48s]  Here we go. One, two, three, action.
[3435.00s -> 3438.17s]  What is this?
[3439.13s -> 3442.97s]  Stealing stuff from returning home with loot gives you extra experience points.
[3442.97s -> 3446.57s]  The first time theft will give 10 times more experience.
[3447.53s -> 3449.69s]  If you're not sure what to do, check your computer.
[3450.49s -> 3451.77s]  All right. Why are the police here?
[3452.49s -> 3453.61s]  The police are called?
[3455.10s -> 3455.98s]  Hide? Where do I hide?
[3458.47s -> 3459.59s]  Oh, they have an alarm.
[3461.06s -> 3461.78s]  Hide in the dumpster.
[3470.66s -> 3472.58s]  You can run away from police by leaving the neighborhood
[3472.58s -> 3474.74s]  or you can hide in a closet, a dumpster under the bed
[3474.74s -> 3476.90s]  and wait for the police to leave.
[3476.90s -> 3479.38s]  If the visibility eye is red, someone saw you
[3479.38s -> 3480.66s]  and the police will find you.
[3486.97s -> 3487.93s]  No one's going to find me.
[3488.57s -> 3490.84s]  No one saw me go into this particular...
[3491.64s -> 3495.69s]  That is if you go in this dumpster.
[3507.19s -> 3508.07s]  When does this stop?
[3516.58s -> 3517.70s]  Do I have to run away?
[3523.75s -> 3524.95s]  You live here now.
[3534.34s -> 3540.58s]  I feel like this is supposed to be done.
[3541.46s -> 3542.10s]  Should I get out?
[3542.74s -> 3549.42s]  How would they know it's you?
[3549.42s -> 3550.14s]  That's a good question.
[3550.14s -> 3552.38s]  All right. I'm going to get out and sprint to the left as fast as I can.
[3554.46s -> 3556.70s]  Oh, music off. Music's done.
[3556.70s -> 3560.46s]  There's one star now.
[3561.02s -> 3563.38s]  Oh, no, no, no. They're leaving.
[3577.03s -> 3578.31s]  There were no police after all.
[3578.95s -> 3579.75s]  All right. Where's my car?
[3580.39s -> 3581.35s]  Over here.
[3581.35s -> 3587.72s]  Somebody was just playing police sounds to scare me.
[3588.36s -> 3591.69s]  What would you be suspicious of?
[3591.69s -> 3592.33s]  I don't have anything up.
[3594.06s -> 3595.50s]  Why are there people surrounding my car?
[3603.35s -> 3606.15s]  The car is parked in a strange place.
[3614.66s -> 3618.55s]  The police are going to tow my car.
[3623.69s -> 3624.73s]  What? Get...
[3627.51s -> 3628.31s]  Don't hit them.
[3628.31s -> 3629.51s]  Don't. I can't go anywhere.
[3629.51s -> 3630.31s]  Either one of these two.
[3647.99s -> 3649.99s]  Open a standard training lock.
[3649.99s -> 3652.44s]  Oh, I did it. I win.
[3652.44s -> 3657.83s]  This is so unsettling.
[3658.55s -> 3661.70s]  All right. We got easy lock.
[3663.08s -> 3664.04s]  Standard lock.
[3664.04s -> 3665.16s]  Requires a lockpick.
[3666.04s -> 3669.43s]  Do I have to buy a lockpick every time?
[3669.99s -> 3671.51s]  So I don't get to reuse it?
[3672.23s -> 3672.87s]  Oh, man.
[3672.87s -> 3674.31s]  That's where the money sink is, huh?
[3685.94s -> 3687.54s]  Oh, shit.
[3695.98s -> 3697.26s]  Can I pawn those?
[3697.26s -> 3700.17s]  Can I pawn those?
[3700.17s -> 3701.53s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[3701.53s -> 3702.17s]  Wait. Oh, there.
[3702.17s -> 3704.17s]  Anybody need any lockpicks?
[3704.81s -> 3706.38s]  I've got this great idea.
[3706.38s -> 3711.58s]  It's called buy, buy, buy shit at premium price.
[3711.58s -> 3713.82s]  Sell for undercut price.
[3719.21s -> 3720.70s]  God.
[3720.70s -> 3723.18s]  You need to lock the pin while it's at the bottom.
[3726.79s -> 3728.07s]  So how do you lock the pin?
[3728.07s -> 3728.95s]  What button do you press?
[3729.75s -> 3730.39s]  Well, here we go.
[3731.19s -> 3733.51s]  Use a lockpick to open standard locks.
[3733.51s -> 3736.63s]  Press the button at the exact time when a pin is at the bottom.
[3737.19s -> 3738.26s]  Okay.
[3740.39s -> 3741.27s]  But first of all,
[3741.27s -> 3743.75s]  let me just try to get a super sweet candy crush here.
[3749.38s -> 3749.86s]  Sweet.
[3758.31s -> 3758.79s]  Lock the pin.
[3760.31s -> 3764.90s]  I have to press S when it's at the bottom, right?
[3764.90s -> 3765.78s]  That's what I just did.
[3765.78s -> 3766.42s]  Have to click.
[3777.62s -> 3778.50s]  Mouse zero.
[3779.06s -> 3782.76s]  Okay. So it's mouse zero.
[3783.56s -> 3787.05s]  That's a strange way to call it.
[3794.76s -> 3797.56s]  If it ain't broke, fix it with a crowbar.
[3798.54s -> 3803.74s]  Word on the street is the toilet in Greenview 113 is not broke.
[3805.86s -> 3806.26s]  Really?
[3808.30s -> 3809.26s]  Break the toilet.
[3811.14s -> 3813.14s]  What is this petty bullshit?
[3813.86s -> 3818.10s]  I feel like I'm being contacted by like ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends.
[3818.10s -> 3819.70s]  I go in there and smash her toilet.
[3820.50s -> 3823.11s]  Go pee on his TV.
[3823.83s -> 3832.06s]  Am I a thief or am I like petty revenge guy?
[3832.70s -> 3834.98s]  All right.
[3834.98s -> 3836.50s]  So I got home.
[3836.50s -> 3837.62s]  Let me, I want to look at this.
[3839.98s -> 3841.34s]  Go pee in his toilet.
[3841.34s -> 3842.70s]  Yeah. Go pee in his toilet.
[3842.70s -> 3844.94s]  All right. We got one, 113.
[3844.94s -> 3845.98s]  Possible loot location.
[3845.98s -> 3847.02s]  Let's see.
[3847.02s -> 3849.50s]  There is a printer worth a lot in the living room.
[3849.50s -> 3852.62s]  These houses are so small at this point in the game that this is, why would I do this?
[3853.18s -> 3856.02s]  No one is there between nine and two.
[3857.99s -> 3860.79s]  And there's a spare key for the front door in the bedroom.
[3860.79s -> 3863.48s]  So between, let's get there at 9 a.m.
[3863.48s -> 3864.60s]  And let's get the printer.
[3880.76s -> 3882.12s]  Steal the printer ink.
[3882.12s -> 3883.16s]  That's worth a lot of money.
[3883.88s -> 3890.95s]  So we're going to take the printer and then we're going to break the toilet.
[3898.02s -> 3899.30s]  There's hiring people to prank.
[3899.94s -> 3908.95s]  Did I even pick anything up for my inventory?
[3908.95s -> 3909.43s]  Items.
[3912.47s -> 3913.35s]  I don't have anything.
[3915.66s -> 3915.98s]  All right.
[3915.98s -> 3918.78s]  So 113 is the other house that's up on the hill there.
[3922.07s -> 3925.75s]  Spend $200 on hints to get $70 for a printer.
[3926.55s -> 3928.81s]  Yeah. Well, I just, that's fine.
[3930.55s -> 3946.60s]  No, I don't want to get arrested.
[3946.60s -> 3947.80s]  I want a perfect record.
[3955.13s -> 3959.39s]  Nice.
[3974.07s -> 3974.71s]  Nice steal.
[3980.49s -> 3981.29s]  I don't want to be arrested.
[3981.29s -> 3983.13s]  Drive straight into the stranger's backyard.
[3983.93s -> 3987.54s]  Well, then they shouldn't put a jump there.
[3988.18s -> 3990.52s]  If they don't want people to try to go off the jump,
[3990.52s -> 3991.96s]  then there shouldn't be a jump available.
[4000.41s -> 4001.77s]  Look, I'm being very careful now.
[4002.49s -> 4014.30s]  All right.
[4014.30s -> 4016.38s]  I need to park this car somewhere where no one's going to care.
[4022.31s -> 4023.67s]  No one's going to walk over here.
[4023.67s -> 4027.61s]  So all right.
[4027.61s -> 4031.69s]  So between 9 a.m., no one's there right now until 2.
[4032.25s -> 4036.41s]  We've got a printer in the living room and we have to smash the toilet.
[4036.41s -> 4038.65s]  So I got a window.
[4041.51s -> 4042.63s]  And I think I'm going to, I'm good.
[4042.63s -> 4043.75s]  Nobody's here to see this.
[4047.05s -> 4048.17s]  Oh, man.
[4051.34s -> 4052.46s]  Where's the toilet?
[4052.46s -> 4053.26s]  Where's the toilet?
[4054.47s -> 4054.95s]  Where is it?
[4058.02s -> 4061.90s]  Where's the, where's the living room?
[4071.03s -> 4071.99s]  Get out.
[4071.99s -> 4072.47s]  Get out.
[4075.53s -> 4076.01s]  Put it down.
[4076.01s -> 4076.25s]  Put it down.
[4076.25s -> 4077.45s]  Put it down.
[4078.66s -> 4079.54s]  Pick it up.
[4079.54s -> 4080.90s]  Why can't I pick the TV up?
[4081.86s -> 4082.82s]  Pick up the TV.
[4092.20s -> 4094.36s]  That's the alarm.
[4102.68s -> 4103.24s]  Oh, shit.
[4128.26s -> 4128.74s]  There he is.
[4130.01s -> 4132.49s]  No, that's a wooden person.
[4133.85s -> 4143.91s]  It's just an outlast.
[4146.84s -> 4147.32s]  9 a.m.
[4147.32s -> 4148.04s]  2 p.m., right?
[4148.04s -> 4150.92s]  We got like three hours to get out of here.
[4160.82s -> 4162.66s]  Tie shoelaces together.
[4162.66s -> 4164.47s]  All right.
[4164.47s -> 4165.27s]  We're good.
[4165.27s -> 4170.98s]  Now what about toys?
[4170.98s -> 4171.30s]  Okay.
[4171.30s -> 4171.70s]  Living room.
[4171.70s -> 4172.42s]  Find the living room.
[4178.14s -> 4179.18s]  I need like the living room.
[4184.73s -> 4192.66s]  Where's the printer?
[4192.66s -> 4193.78s]  Holy shit, the thing's huge.
[4208.76s -> 4210.20s]  How do I get it out here?
[4210.20s -> 4211.48s]  Can I get it out of this window?
[4213.85s -> 4214.33s]  Fuck.
[4214.33s -> 4215.37s]  Oh, they're coming back.
[4215.37s -> 4216.01s]  They're coming back.
[4216.01s -> 4216.49s]  They're coming back.
[4216.49s -> 4217.77s]  Get back out of the bed.
[4217.77s -> 4218.41s]  Get out of the bed.
[4228.34s -> 4234.68s]  So I got the front door.
[4234.68s -> 4250.33s]  I can't fit through there.
[4250.33s -> 4256.84s]  Can't fit through here though, apparently.
[4256.84s -> 4257.88s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[4257.88s -> 4258.20s]  Hint.
[4258.20s -> 4260.28s]  There's a spare key for the front door on the bedroom.
[4260.28s -> 4274.20s]  Time is it?
[4274.20s -> 4282.42s]  Oh, that's a guitar.
[4282.42s -> 4287.08s]  Let's see.
[4287.08s -> 4287.56s]  Oh, shit.
[4287.56s -> 4289.32s]  These are vases and shit.
[4289.32s -> 4289.48s]  Okay.
[4289.48s -> 4289.96s]  What time is it?
[4289.96s -> 4290.28s]  Got to go.
[4290.84s -> 4292.82s]  Okay.
[4293.38s -> 4293.86s]  Got to go.
[4293.86s -> 4294.58s]  What is this?
[4294.58s -> 4295.14s]  A camera.
[4295.14s -> 4295.86s]  Worth a lot of money.
[4295.86s -> 4296.82s]  Can't take it.
[4296.82s -> 4297.22s]  Move.
[4297.22s -> 4298.26s]  Oh, oh, they're coming back.
[4298.98s -> 4300.76s]  I can't even take money?
[4301.40s -> 4301.64s]  All right.
[4301.64s -> 4302.20s]  Where's the printer?
[4319.29s -> 4320.73s]  Get it in the car quick.
[4321.61s -> 4322.65s]  Get it in the car.
[4324.46s -> 4325.98s]  I can't sprint with this thing.
[4325.98s -> 4326.70s]  It's too heavy.
[4330.65s -> 4331.05s]  All right.
[4331.05s -> 4331.37s]  Open.
[4342.33s -> 4343.61s]  And I'm out of here.
[4344.25s -> 4346.25s]  That's how you do it.
[4346.25s -> 4351.26s]  What about the TV?
[4351.26s -> 4352.62s]  I can't put the TV in there, man.
[4356.15s -> 4356.79s]  That's all right.
[4364.71s -> 4366.71s]  Like a man spider, you know?
[4368.15s -> 4368.79s]  Oh, I know.
[4371.02s -> 4372.22s]  First, let me see something here.
[4373.99s -> 4378.55s]  Car parts, electronics, microwave, radio, kitchen.
[4378.55s -> 4381.83s]  Other is the guitar.
[4382.98s -> 4383.70s]  300 bucks.
[4386.09s -> 4387.85s]  So I have to bring the printer to the pawn shop?
[4391.51s -> 4392.15s]  Rent a thug.
[4392.15s -> 4392.71s]  All right.
[4392.71s -> 4394.07s]  Break or steal the painting.
[4394.87s -> 4396.79s]  Break or steal the kiss painting.
[4401.46s -> 4403.38s]  So that's like, that's teeth.
[4403.38s -> 4405.30s]  That's just an x-ray of somebody biting down.
[4407.30s -> 4407.78s]  All right.
[4407.78s -> 4410.58s]  Um, let's, let's stay with the tutorial here though.
[4412.54s -> 4414.70s]  So learn agility level two.
[4418.57s -> 4420.01s]  Here's agility.
[4420.01s -> 4420.97s]  Agility one.
[4421.77s -> 4422.97s]  Throw bricks.
[4426.30s -> 4427.42s]  I don't, I don't need to care.
[4427.42s -> 4428.38s]  I don't care about anything else.
[4434.44s -> 4434.76s]  All right.
[4434.76s -> 4435.16s]  Let's go.
[4436.55s -> 4437.99s]  Let's go throw bricks at stuff.
[4440.55s -> 4442.55s]  So we got rent a thug.
[4442.55s -> 4444.07s]  So break the painting.
[4444.95s -> 4446.47s]  We'll just break them all.
[4446.47s -> 4448.07s]  One 10, one 12 smack.
[4448.07s -> 4449.35s]  Just break their paintings.
[4450.52s -> 4451.48s]  Now, can I buy a brick?
[4454.49s -> 4455.61s]  Is brick available?
[4466.28s -> 4467.56s]  So let me get this out of here.
[4470.28s -> 4470.76s]  Sell this.
[4474.76s -> 4476.28s]  What can I buy a brick?
[4476.28s -> 4477.80s]  It's a, it's a pretty good question, right?
[4492.94s -> 4493.34s]  Okay.
[4493.34s -> 4498.60s]  I wish you could open the door.
[4498.60s -> 4499.32s]  Welcome back.
[4503.30s -> 4503.78s]  Favorites.
[4506.52s -> 4507.16s]  Oh damn.
[4510.60s -> 4510.84s]  Okay.
[4510.84s -> 4511.80s]  Well, that was a lot of money.
[4512.90s -> 4513.14s]  All right.
[4513.14s -> 4514.10s]  Let's go break stuff.
[4514.66s -> 4520.22s]  Uh, do we have any Intel on one?
[4521.38s -> 4522.26s]  There's one 10.
[4530.09s -> 4530.89s]  My trunk is open.
[4530.89s -> 4531.85s]  It's all right.
[4531.85s -> 4534.07s]  It'll be fine.
[4534.63s -> 4535.50s]  Don't worry.
[4537.78s -> 4538.18s]  All right.
[4538.18s -> 4545.78s]  So, uh, we need to go to one 10 and one 12 and break this, the paintings or steal them.
[4546.42s -> 4548.49s]  Do we have Intel on the people there?
[4550.92s -> 4553.00s]  Let's see if I have any Intel on one 10.
[4553.00s -> 4553.24s]  All right.
[4553.24s -> 4554.36s]  I need to like park this.
[4554.36s -> 4555.48s]  There's a parking garage right here.
[4556.28s -> 4580.42s]  All right.
[4580.42s -> 4581.06s]  One 10.
[4581.70s -> 4583.56s]  Let's see.
[4583.56s -> 4584.04s]  We got me.
[4584.04s -> 4584.92s]  This is one 11.
[4585.56s -> 4587.13s]  This guy not home.
[4587.77s -> 4589.72s]  We're one 10.
[4589.72s -> 4590.12s]  Let's go.
[4590.12s -> 4590.92s]  I'm going to go over on the back.
[4595.10s -> 4596.46s]  I can't, I can't climb this.
[4597.18s -> 4603.40s]  I mean, there are no bricks.
[4603.40s -> 4604.44s]  I can't throw anything.
[4605.93s -> 4606.97s]  There's a guy home.
[4606.97s -> 4608.17s]  I don't even know if this guy's home.
[4610.10s -> 4611.22s]  What if he's open his door?
[4611.22s -> 4634.82s]  Is he going, oh, why are they coming over here?
[4659.94s -> 4661.14s]  They're not going to come all the way over here.
[4662.39s -> 4665.11s]  And if they do, I think their AI is not going to be smart enough.
[4665.11s -> 4666.95s]  They're going to run right by me and turn around and run back.
[4667.67s -> 4669.62s]  I'm like wedged up into the wall.
[4669.62s -> 4672.46s]  See, I'm going to get caught here.
[4672.46s -> 4673.02s]  Definitely.
[4673.02s -> 4674.38s]  I don't, I don't think so, man.
[4674.94s -> 4676.06s]  I think we're good.
[4676.06s -> 4686.17s]  I'm hiding like a child.
[4687.78s -> 4690.98s]  Hey, sometimes the simplest of techniques is the most effective.
[4702.09s -> 4703.21s]  All right, go on and get out of here.
[4709.53s -> 4710.65s]  The painting's right there.
[4716.34s -> 4717.54s]  Get out of here.
[4717.54s -> 4717.86s]  Why?
[4718.58s -> 4723.06s]  Hey, look, I'm going to do signals.
[4730.70s -> 4731.50s]  One of them gave up.
[4732.06s -> 4740.57s]  They only have one thief in town.
[4740.57s -> 4741.13s]  All right.
[4741.13s -> 4744.57s]  That, what is happening right now?
[4744.57s -> 4746.49s]  Two gave up.
[4746.49s -> 4747.13s]  There's the third one.
[4747.13s -> 4748.73s]  Why is the third one not giving up?
[4748.73s -> 4750.01s]  In fact, I have an opportunity here.
[4750.97s -> 4752.09s]  I need to see if anyone's here.
[4752.97s -> 4758.55s]  I don't see anybody in here.
[4759.19s -> 4762.14s]  And in the bathroom, maybe?
[4762.94s -> 4764.87s]  But I have to smash this.
[4765.67s -> 4773.27s]  Well, it is, what the fuck?
[4773.27s -> 4773.99s]  Get out of here.
[4779.18s -> 4781.42s]  Is this going to, what are they, how can,
[4781.42s -> 4782.78s]  how can you tell if a place has an alarm?
[4783.42s -> 4788.14s]  Why are they walking?
[4788.14s -> 4789.58s]  Oh, to go into their house.
[4791.35s -> 4792.47s]  Oh, no.
[4792.47s -> 4793.27s]  This is their house.
[4798.66s -> 4800.10s]  No, is it, or are they just on the road?
[4804.02s -> 4804.74s]  They won't leave.
[4816.46s -> 4821.80s]  Where's my car?
[4822.44s -> 4824.81s]  Where's my car?
[4824.81s -> 4837.61s]  I think we're in the clear.
[4837.61s -> 4838.09s]  There it is.
[4838.09s -> 4838.33s]  Okay.
[4839.05s -> 4844.95s]  All right, I need one, 111 is this unknown.
[4845.67s -> 4848.78s]  I need to go to 112 and do the same thing.
[4851.93s -> 4853.69s]  Don't walk past people's windows.
[4853.69s -> 4854.57s]  What am I, stupid?
[4856.22s -> 4857.26s]  All right, police are gone.
[4859.58s -> 4862.06s]  The same shit happened last time and I got stuck back here.
[4862.70s -> 4866.15s]  What is this here for?
[4866.15s -> 4867.83s]  See, this is, I told you, there's a jump here.
[4868.39s -> 4879.53s]  There's a guy right there.
[4879.53s -> 4880.49s]  All right, what is this?
[4880.49s -> 4881.53s]  Electricity?
[4881.53s -> 4885.62s]  I have to go all the way around.
[4891.70s -> 4892.50s]  I can get intel, right?
[4893.22s -> 4897.93s]  I got a new routine.
[4898.81s -> 4906.46s]  Just put it down, put it down.
[4927.48s -> 4929.64s]  I'm under arrest?
[4929.64s -> 4931.64s]  Well, I feel like it could have outran you
[4931.64s -> 4933.56s]  after you flipped over your fucking squad car.
[4941.67s -> 4942.95s]  Where, where is this?
[4943.67s -> 4945.48s]  No, it was just right there.
[4946.12s -> 4954.01s]  All right, so we got, we got a couple of jobs.
[4954.01s -> 4954.49s]  Job.
[4956.12s -> 4957.96s]  Let's go to break the, let's go to one.
[4957.96s -> 4959.64s]  The other one's more expensive anyways.
[4960.20s -> 4961.08s]  112.
[4962.82s -> 4963.86s]  You can steal it too.
[4964.58s -> 4970.15s]  You're under arrest.
[4970.87s -> 4974.57s]  You did 112.
[4975.21s -> 4976.33s]  I didn't steal a painting.
[4977.13s -> 4983.80s]  I need to like go up there.
[5007.50s -> 5008.62s]  No, I can mark this person.
[5009.18s -> 5009.90s]  Wait, hold on.
[5009.90s -> 5011.26s]  Why can't I see these people through the walls?
[5011.26s -> 5014.34s]  There's a spare key for the front door.
[5014.34s -> 5014.66s]  Okay.
[5017.48s -> 5018.76s]  Well, I know that whole routine.
[5019.90s -> 5020.46s]  112.
[5020.46s -> 5020.94s]  Here we go.
[5021.74s -> 5027.42s]  Break or steal the kiss.
[5027.42s -> 5028.78s]  But it's 150 bucks for this.
[5029.50s -> 5031.96s]  Oh, they're both there.
[5031.96s -> 5033.40s]  I wonder if I can get a routine here.
[5034.04s -> 5040.10s]  Well, the painting's in there.
[5041.14s -> 5042.66s]  I could bust the lock, steal the painting
[5042.66s -> 5043.86s]  and get out scott free.
[5048.73s -> 5049.53s]  They're okay.
[5049.53s -> 5051.21s]  Look at how long they're in the bedroom here for though.
[5052.60s -> 5054.04s]  See if I can pick them when they're.
[5054.68s -> 5058.46s]  Because if they're in the bedroom for that long,
[5058.46s -> 5060.62s]  I can pop the lock, go grab the painting
[5060.62s -> 5061.02s]  and get out.
[5061.66s -> 5064.10s]  But they're at the end of it here.
[5064.10s -> 5065.06s]  It's probably a bad idea.
[5070.57s -> 5071.53s]  Yeah, they're about to be out.
[5072.25s -> 5074.74s]  Should I go for it?
[5075.30s -> 5078.68s]  I'm going for it.
[5098.44s -> 5098.84s]  I didn't.
[5098.84s -> 5100.04s]  I was looking at chat.
[5100.04s -> 5101.00s]  Why would I do that?
[5113.27s -> 5114.23s]  Give me the molar painting.
[5114.23s -> 5115.83s]  Give me like the fucking chew impression.
[5121.27s -> 5121.59s]  What?
[5125.56s -> 5125.80s]  What?
[5143.50s -> 5144.86s]  Oh, oh, which way are they going?
[5144.86s -> 5145.74s]  Which way are they going?
[5145.74s -> 5151.13s]  I think I can make it.
[5151.13s -> 5154.73s]  I think I can make it.
[5176.54s -> 5177.02s]  See ya.
[5198.10s -> 5199.14s]  And I got the painting.
[5199.14s -> 5205.37s]  I just walked an antique painting.
[5205.37s -> 5207.61s]  I just walked a full couch through the neighborhood.
[5211.86s -> 5212.18s]  Really?
[5213.32s -> 5215.08s]  I would give that an A.
[5215.08s -> 5218.38s]  But the amount of preparation and dodging and weaving
[5218.38s -> 5220.46s]  and that was not an F.
[5220.46s -> 5221.02s]  I'm sorry.
[5226.68s -> 5226.92s]  All right.
[5226.92s -> 5228.44s]  Should I pawn this or should I sell it here?
[5231.80s -> 5233.59s]  Art.
[5233.59s -> 5239.42s]  Well, it's not under art.
[5239.42s -> 5240.14s]  Antiques.
[5240.14s -> 5240.54s]  Other.
[5240.54s -> 5240.94s]  Kitchen.
[5241.83s -> 5242.63s]  Electronics.
[5242.63s -> 5243.19s]  Car parts.
[5243.19s -> 5243.51s]  Yeah.
[5244.39s -> 5244.71s]  All right.
[5245.35s -> 5247.35s]  So I did it.
[5247.35s -> 5248.63s]  I actually still am on that one.
[5248.63s -> 5249.27s]  I got to pawn this.
[5250.07s -> 5258.62s]  I wonder what it's worth.
[5259.34s -> 5261.18s]  I'm going to say 500 bucks.
[5262.14s -> 5265.69s]  Scroll down.
[5265.69s -> 5266.41s]  I did scroll.
[5266.41s -> 5267.53s]  I got to the bottom of the scroll.
[5268.58s -> 5269.38s]  Welcome back.
[5273.02s -> 5276.30s]  Well, it's 150 dollars to break the damn thing.
[5276.30s -> 5277.50s]  Go through all the trouble of stealing.
[5277.50s -> 5278.78s]  It has to be something worth doing.
[5298.17s -> 5298.97s]  All right.
[5298.97s -> 5302.78s]  Apparently not.
[5302.78s -> 5303.02s]  All right.
[5303.02s -> 5304.38s]  I need agility level two.
[5305.10s -> 5306.97s]  Required level six.
[5307.77s -> 5310.95s]  I just have to just keep stealing things?
[5315.53s -> 5316.89s]  That's on top of the 150?
[5317.77s -> 5318.65s]  Yeah, it probably is.
[5335.03s -> 5335.43s]  All right.
[5336.39s -> 5338.23s]  The only thing I can do here is either just...
[5338.23s -> 5339.83s]  I can just go into random people's houses.
[5341.16s -> 5341.40s]  Right?
[5342.12s -> 5343.94s]  What's stopping me from doing that?
[5344.58s -> 5360.25s]  What about 106?
[5360.25s -> 5361.29s]  Let's just case this place.
[5365.59s -> 5366.47s]  Unknown.
[5366.47s -> 5373.93s]  I can't mark you.
[5373.93s -> 5374.97s]  I can see you right through the door.
[5375.77s -> 5381.82s]  Somebody coming down the street.
[5381.82s -> 5382.94s]  What are you doing out this late?
[5383.50s -> 5384.14s]  Get out of here.
[5384.78s -> 5387.42s]  Why are you even on the road?
[5388.14s -> 5393.82s]  Ring the doorbell.
[5394.62s -> 5423.61s]  Got you.
[5427.42s -> 5428.46s]  What happened to this person?
[5428.46s -> 5433.18s]  What is this person doing?
[5433.18s -> 5434.62s]  Oh, they're going to sleep.
[5434.62s -> 5436.50s]  All right.
[5436.50s -> 5437.54s]  I got you.
[5437.54s -> 5440.94s]  So you are in the kitchen.
[5440.94s -> 5441.18s]  You're...
[5441.18s -> 5441.42s]  Okay.
[5441.42s -> 5442.46s]  So he's in there for a while.
[5443.59s -> 5445.83s]  They're both incapacitated for a little while here.
[5445.83s -> 5449.32s]  This person is very restless.
[5449.32s -> 5449.72s]  All right.
[5449.72s -> 5451.24s]  Let's get in here through the...
[5451.88s -> 5463.05s]  Keep an eye on that minimap for me.
[5463.69s -> 5469.16s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[5477.74s -> 5479.90s]  The blue is when they're not doing...
[5479.90s -> 5480.14s]  Really?
[5480.78s -> 5485.11s]  No, it looks like we're going to 107.
[5485.83s -> 5492.57s]  The Wilsons have a huge house.
[5496.63s -> 5497.67s]  Just climb over the fence?
[5497.67s -> 5498.87s]  See, I can't.
[5498.87s -> 5500.79s]  I don't know how to use a fence.
[5504.39s -> 5507.59s]  Not until I level up, like, one more time in agility.
[5507.59s -> 5508.71s]  I can't use a fence.
[5509.43s -> 5512.68s]  I think it's an intel, though.
[5515.91s -> 5517.51s]  Any other intel for 107?
[5524.44s -> 5526.12s]  I think there's only one way in to 107.
[5526.84s -> 5530.44s]  Through the front door?
[5531.24s -> 5535.94s]  I can't, like, take the mail?
[5536.66s -> 5540.60s]  All right.
[5540.60s -> 5541.08s]  I'm going to wait.
[5542.47s -> 5543.35s]  Anybody right here?
[5543.35s -> 5547.59s]  I need to wait till you walk by.
[5547.59s -> 5549.11s]  Just walk by so I can open this.
[5549.83s -> 5556.33s]  What's it blinking to?
[5556.33s -> 5557.29s]  It's easy to climb the fence.
[5557.29s -> 5557.85s]  Yeah, yeah.
[5559.56s -> 5560.76s]  Stealing mail is illegal.
[5561.40s -> 5564.52s]  Um, so is smashing windows, taking paintings,
[5565.32s -> 5566.68s]  and throwing bricks at people.
[5567.32s -> 5569.90s]  Okay.
[5569.90s -> 5573.42s]  Opportunity is arising right now.
[5574.14s -> 5608.18s]  Getting gnomed.
[5609.14s -> 5612.14s]  They have all their blinds closed.
[5614.97s -> 5616.57s]  You know, this is probably a mission to do that.
[5616.57s -> 5617.05s]  All right, here we go.
[5617.05s -> 5617.61s]  Back door.
[5618.17s -> 5619.61s]  I need luck picking three.
[5619.61s -> 5621.21s]  This house is secure.
[5624.52s -> 5625.40s]  No, so is this.
[5625.96s -> 5627.72s]  All right, well, just take all the cool stuff
[5627.72s -> 5628.60s]  they have in their backyard.
[5631.06s -> 5632.10s]  Well, I'll take that.
[5632.10s -> 5632.82s]  15 bucks.
[5632.82s -> 5633.54s]  We got a radio.
[5635.96s -> 5636.36s]  Wine.
[5637.08s -> 5639.13s]  A couple of nice wines.
[5643.75s -> 5644.47s]  On the grill.
[5645.03s -> 5650.33s]  I want to whip a brick through that window.
[5650.33s -> 5650.81s]  So bad.
[5651.53s -> 5653.75s]  That's it, right?
[5657.30s -> 5657.94s]  What if I do this?
[5658.74s -> 5663.45s]  Can I annoy them enough?
[5663.45s -> 5664.41s]  Were they going to open the door?
[5664.97s -> 5671.45s]  I can't get in here.
[5672.87s -> 5674.07s]  Leave mud here.
[5675.13s -> 5676.01s]  Where's their doorbell?
[5676.65s -> 5677.77s]  Are they smart and they don't have one?
[5678.33s -> 5680.26s]  Where's your doorbell?
[5685.51s -> 5687.38s]  Fine.
[5687.38s -> 5688.34s]  Throw a brick.
[5688.34s -> 5690.10s]  There is no brick.
[5690.10s -> 5691.30s]  Do you see a brick anywhere?
[5694.46s -> 5695.66s]  How do I throw a brick?
[5704.94s -> 5705.82s]  Throw gnome.
[5706.54s -> 5708.30s]  I, I don't have anything.
[5708.94s -> 5718.30s]  The key definitely under the mat.
[5719.02s -> 5720.62s]  Well, I, I can't get it.
[5727.35s -> 5728.55s]  Yeah, this house is locked up.
[5732.58s -> 5733.86s]  Holy fuck, that guy could see.
[5733.86s -> 5734.82s]  All right, what about over here?
[5737.21s -> 5738.49s]  I gotta go craft a brick.
[5741.19s -> 5744.47s]  I need, I need to just steal a few more things.
[5744.47s -> 5745.03s]  All right, here we go.
[5745.03s -> 5745.59s]  104.
[5748.09s -> 5748.81s]  Nobody around.
[5749.45s -> 5754.52s]  What's over in the corner?
[5754.52s -> 5755.08s]  That's mail.
[5755.88s -> 5756.84s]  All right, the people that are in,
[5756.84s -> 5757.72s]  people are sleeping in here.
[5757.72s -> 5758.20s]  What time is it?
[5758.68s -> 5759.80s]  It's 2 a.m.
[5760.44s -> 5763.18s]  Level three lockpick.
[5763.82s -> 5764.78s]  What the fuck?
[5764.78s -> 5774.92s]  Is that level three?
[5783.16s -> 5783.56s]  Nope.
[5783.56s -> 5784.68s]  No, it's level three.
[5784.68s -> 5802.42s]  Shit.
[5802.42s -> 5802.98s]  Shit.
[5802.98s -> 5814.14s]  I was trying to go in with them.
[5827.94s -> 5829.06s]  I can open this one.
[5829.06s -> 5842.20s]  So I can't do any of these houses.
[5842.20s -> 5844.60s]  I need like level three lockpicking to even do with them.
[5844.60s -> 5850.26s]  I need like other tools.
[5850.26s -> 5851.14s]  All right, I have to stay away.
[5851.14s -> 5855.32s]  I gotta go to like 101 through 103, apparently.
[5855.32s -> 5862.82s]  Because I really only have one thing to do.
[5863.93s -> 5875.21s]  I have, the job that I have is steal the painting in 110.
[5875.21s -> 5876.09s]  That's 50 bucks.
[5876.73s -> 5879.02s]  I don't have any other jobs to do.
[5879.74s -> 5880.62s]  All right, I took the loot there.
[5880.62s -> 5882.22s]  I need to like case the places out, man.
[5882.22s -> 5882.46s]  Let's see.
[5882.46s -> 5883.26s]  Okay, 110.
[5883.26s -> 5884.30s]  That's where I'm supposed, let's go.
[5884.94s -> 5890.46s]  Let's make our kind of cheese.
[5891.83s -> 5895.53s]  Um, I'm a big Swiss cheese kind of fan, but.
[5896.09s -> 5900.44s]  You know, Havarti is really good.
[5901.16s -> 5904.95s]  What am I answering this question?
[5905.67s -> 5906.17s]  What?
[5912.73s -> 5923.87s]  Yeah, no, Swiss cheese is great.
[5924.51s -> 5928.56s]  All right, I just gotta break or steal the painting over here at 110.
[5929.28s -> 5930.72s]  And then I would probably get more tasks.
[5935.42s -> 5936.78s]  All right, break or steal the painting.
[5937.42s -> 5944.32s]  The people are probably home right now because it is 9 30 p.m.
[5945.12s -> 5949.05s]  I don't see anybody in this room standing.
[5950.99s -> 5952.27s]  Oh, forget about the flashlight.
[5959.20s -> 5961.44s]  Dude, can I just like learn how to climb the fence?
[5962.16s -> 5967.52s]  I need to learn how to climb a fence.
[5968.16s -> 5976.36s]  Because I, all right, we're going to the front door.
[5979.80s -> 5982.01s]  Is somebody here?
[5982.01s -> 5994.65s]  Just break it.
[5994.65s -> 6002.72s]  All right, I did it.
[6002.72s -> 6006.56s]  They're not even home.
[6008.14s -> 6008.46s]  Got it.
[6009.72s -> 6014.89s]  Okay, that was an original.
[6015.45s -> 6017.53s]  You know, they shouldn't have had it displayed in the window.
[6018.17s -> 6026.59s]  Why on earth would you display like a fucking million dollar painting right in the window?
[6029.98s -> 6040.33s]  And you have single pane windows so people can see.
[6041.61s -> 6049.50s]  All right, do I have anything to sell besides that?
[6049.50s -> 6059.00s]  They can't afford any more window panes because they already bought the painting.
[6061.05s -> 6061.77s]  Welcome back.
[6062.57s -> 6063.45s]  I have no items.
[6066.40s -> 6078.40s]  All right, is there anything else for me to take from the home?
[6078.40s -> 6081.52s]  It was actually only a 50-dollar painting so that doesn't make any sense.
[6081.52s -> 6084.48s]  But I mean, come on, if you have like an original Mona Lisa,
[6084.48s -> 6090.64s]  if you had the Mona Lisa and you lived in a single level one bedroom
[6090.64s -> 6092.72s]  with like 10 windows and you had it on your wall,
[6094.67s -> 6098.59s]  like somebody is going to smash your window and take it.
[6098.59s -> 6099.15s]  They just will.
[6099.95s -> 6103.66s]  You need to have like a home alone style booby traps everywhere.
[6104.38s -> 6113.44s]  Well, thanks for giving me more of your routine.
[6116.00s -> 6118.64s]  You wouldn't be living in that house if you had the Mona Lisa.
[6119.66s -> 6121.90s]  Yeah, you know that that's 100% true.
[6125.39s -> 6131.47s]  Like a 50 million dollar painting and you're in like a one bedroom in like a suburb somewhere.
[6136.72s -> 6138.40s]  I'm obsessed with these houses.
[6139.04s -> 6140.40s]  I got to get over these houses.
[6140.96s -> 6150.89s]  I just need to start taking stuff.
[6150.89s -> 6152.65s]  What about 103 and 102?
[6153.29s -> 6155.15s]  I just need money.
[6155.15s -> 6156.19s]  I just need experience.
[6156.99s -> 6168.38s]  Does it learn to climb?
[6169.60s -> 6172.80s]  I have to do this before I get experience to learn to climb.
[6173.60s -> 6181.92s]  Okay, so we got this looks very elaborate.
[6181.92s -> 6182.80s]  Electronic door.
[6184.24s -> 6184.80s]  Lights are on.
[6185.44s -> 6188.08s]  Somebody's listening to music.
[6195.90s -> 6196.94s]  Anybody behind here?
[6197.66s -> 6204.33s]  No, they're not having like a backyard barbecue.
[6204.97s -> 6206.57s]  That's perfect for me to take whatever I want.
[6207.29s -> 6211.13s]  You don't have anything back here at all?
[6212.19s -> 6212.59s]  Nothing.
[6213.82s -> 6214.06s]  Shit.
[6214.70s -> 6221.55s]  Damn it.
[6221.55s -> 6228.14s]  Do I have to like break in the front door right now?
[6231.76s -> 6233.12s]  I can't even do that.
[6233.12s -> 6234.08s]  And they don't have a doorbell.
[6234.97s -> 6236.17s]  Well, this house is secure.
[6236.89s -> 6239.98s]  Mona Lisa would be do very well in there.
[6240.62s -> 6245.53s]  There's a person coming right now.
[6245.53s -> 6252.35s]  I don't think anybody needs to get home.
[6259.34s -> 6259.98s]  101.
[6260.70s -> 6263.10s]  How's 101?
[6264.75s -> 6265.87s]  Security cameras.
[6269.26s -> 6270.78s]  They got they got the whole thing set up here.
[6270.78s -> 6273.18s]  There's security here pointing this way.
[6273.98s -> 6275.55s]  Cameras in the front of the house.
[6276.19s -> 6282.40s]  All right.
[6282.40s -> 6283.95s]  Anybody in there?
[6284.59s -> 6293.79s]  You don't just have any trash I can take and sell?
[6294.67s -> 6299.72s]  Now you get on top of this.
[6300.36s -> 6301.40s]  Lockpicking level three.
[6302.44s -> 6305.40s]  All right, we have to go back to the other houses.
[6305.40s -> 6306.20s]  It's like 110.
[6307.79s -> 6310.19s]  I have to rob the same guy over and over again.
[6310.91s -> 6313.71s]  Or this one would open.
[6315.92s -> 6317.20s]  So sad.
[6317.20s -> 6319.28s]  I have to rob the same person?
[6319.28s -> 6322.88s]  Okay, I don't know where they are now.
[6322.88s -> 6324.96s]  But it is 2am.
[6324.96s -> 6325.84s]  They're probably asleep.
[6326.56s -> 6330.70s]  This guy's gonna walk right by.
[6333.60s -> 6335.84s]  This many pedestrians outside at two o'clock in the morning.
[6337.20s -> 6337.44s]  No.
[6338.41s -> 6339.29s]  Where the hell do we live?
[6339.93s -> 6343.20s]  People just taking strolls at 2am.
[6343.92s -> 6350.32s]  All right, please don't come down and get like a glass of milk.
[6371.95s -> 6372.51s]  50 bucks.
[6376.01s -> 6376.89s]  I hope they don't wake up.
[6376.89s -> 6378.01s]  It's three o'clock in the morning.
[6378.01s -> 6379.05s]  Who's gonna wake up right now?
[6389.50s -> 6390.46s]  $15.
[6390.46s -> 6390.86s]  All right.
[6393.92s -> 6394.88s]  Oh, slowly.
[6397.40s -> 6398.04s]  Slowly.
[6398.04s -> 6400.94s]  Oh, whatever.
[6400.94s -> 6401.90s]  They're not gonna fucking hear it.
[6401.90s -> 6402.54s]  They're in the bed.
[6405.52s -> 6406.56s]  Nothing up here anyways.
[6406.56s -> 6408.75s]  All right, no money.
[6410.44s -> 6411.24s]  There's another safe.
[6411.24s -> 6418.20s]  It is plenty of what?
[6418.20s -> 6423.71s]  Somebody in a basement underground?
[6426.60s -> 6427.08s]  Oh, fuck.
[6436.28s -> 6437.16s]  I can't fit in there.
[6437.16s -> 6438.04s]  There's oh, yeah, I can.
[6438.04s -> 6439.08s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6439.08s -> 6441.05s]  I'm gonna pee.
[6441.05s -> 6441.77s]  I gotta pee my.
[6441.77s -> 6442.81s]  Oh, that's a camera.
[6446.38s -> 6448.14s]  And we got a damaged U-phone.
[6448.14s -> 6449.02s]  If someone's looking for that.
[6449.58s -> 6457.88s]  I'm gonna pee my pants.
[6458.52s -> 6459.96s]  I don't know why I have to pee so bad.
[6461.36s -> 6461.86s]  Why?
[6464.40s -> 6464.96s]  It just started.
[6464.96s -> 6465.28s]  I don't know.
[6465.28s -> 6467.44s]  When I walked in here, I got nervous and I just had to pee.
[6468.24s -> 6470.65s]  I'm like a small dog.
[6471.21s -> 6477.24s]  It was in there.
[6477.24s -> 6477.80s]  Silverware.
[6480.46s -> 6481.10s]  4 a.m.
[6481.10s -> 6482.94s]  I gotta get out of here by like 6.
[6489.10s -> 6490.22s]  Now turn the light off.
[6490.22s -> 6491.26s]  We're easy.
[6491.98s -> 6500.84s]  All right.
[6500.84s -> 6501.40s]  It's time to go.
[6502.40s -> 6504.75s]  I gotta get out of here.
[6504.75s -> 6505.92s]  Okay.
[6505.92s -> 6506.80s]  Oh, Huey.
[6507.36s -> 6508.60s]  What is a Huey?
[6509.24s -> 6517.21s]  Is that your door?
[6517.77s -> 6518.89s]  What was the door?
[6518.89s -> 6519.45s]  I heard door.
[6526.64s -> 6529.34s]  5 a.m.
[6529.34s -> 6529.82s]  5 a.m.
[6529.82s -> 6530.06s]  Out.
[6546.89s -> 6548.57s]  Okay, let's sell this stuff.
[6548.57s -> 6553.20s]  There was something that on that black market,
[6553.20s -> 6554.56s]  somebody wanted one of these things.
[6558.33s -> 6558.97s]  I'll take an A.
[6559.85s -> 6560.41s]  All right.
[6560.41s -> 6561.29s]  So there's another level up.
[6561.93s -> 6564.64s]  I thought the skill point is available.
[6564.64s -> 6565.36s]  Let's take a look.
[6566.52s -> 6568.28s]  So I'm level five.
[6568.28s -> 6569.48s]  I can't even buy this.
[6570.28s -> 6571.82s]  I can do this.
[6572.46s -> 6574.70s]  Appraise more items on the spot.
[6574.70s -> 6578.88s]  That is the only thing I can do.
[6579.84s -> 6581.84s]  So I'd have better appraisal skills.
[6582.40s -> 6586.38s]  I need to do more.
[6586.38s -> 6587.42s]  I need to steal more shit.
[6588.14s -> 6591.32s]  All right.
[6591.32s -> 6592.28s]  What did somebody want here?
[6593.88s -> 6598.04s]  I have any of that.
[6598.04s -> 6598.68s]  Car parts.
[6598.68s -> 6599.40s]  Electronics.
[6600.20s -> 6601.80s]  Somebody wanted a damaged U-phone.
[6602.52s -> 6602.84s]  Sure.
[6604.33s -> 6604.97s]  Router.
[6604.97s -> 6605.45s]  Radio.
[6606.01s -> 6606.65s]  Kitchen.
[6606.65s -> 6607.05s]  Other.
[6607.05s -> 6607.69s]  Antiques.
[6608.49s -> 6609.07s]  What was it?
[6609.07s -> 6609.79s]  What did I pick up?
[6609.79s -> 6610.51s]  I picked something up.
[6611.15s -> 6612.64s]  Oh, here we go.
[6612.64s -> 6614.72s]  Break or steal the pear decoration.
[6615.52s -> 6616.40s]  At 113.
[6621.26s -> 6621.90s]  Easy enough.
[6622.70s -> 6623.63s]  All right.
[6623.63s -> 6624.91s]  I'm going to sleep.
[6624.91s -> 6626.11s]  I'm going to pee my pants.
[6626.11s -> 6627.15s]  So I'll be right back.
[6627.15s -> 6628.75s]  See you guys in like two minutes.
[6764.11s -> 6764.99s]  All right.
[6764.99s -> 6771.84s]  So what do you say?
[6771.84s -> 6778.09s]  But yeah, I mean,
[6778.09s -> 6780.97s]  I make sure that I have none of my stuff like in any windows.
[6780.97s -> 6782.01s]  Like none of any.
[6782.01s -> 6783.61s]  Literally all the stuff that I own.
[6783.61s -> 6785.93s]  I make sure to just completely protect myself.
[6785.93s -> 6787.21s]  Everything I own is underneath my bed.
[6788.09s -> 6789.37s]  Every painting.
[6789.37s -> 6790.57s]  All my game consoles.
[6791.37s -> 6792.49s]  All the money that I own.
[6792.49s -> 6793.45s]  I just put it under my bed.
[6794.17s -> 6796.99s]  So I have like a house worth of shit under my bed.
[6797.71s -> 6804.00s]  So people will look to the windows.
[6804.00s -> 6805.68s]  They're like, well, this guy is like fucking nothing.
[6805.68s -> 6806.96s]  But they literally realize
[6808.94s -> 6812.78s]  I have a vintage motorcycle under my bed.
[6818.57s -> 6822.33s]  I've got every DVD of Spongebob under the bed.
[6822.33s -> 6829.15s]  See, what I do is I put,
[6829.15s -> 6831.15s]  I take the Spongebob boxes
[6831.87s -> 6834.11s]  and I leave the boxes out right in the open.
[6834.11s -> 6834.67s]  Like, holy shit.
[6834.67s -> 6836.03s]  Well, he's got all the Spongebob.
[6836.03s -> 6837.23s]  Hey, stupid idiot.
[6837.23s -> 6840.28s]  I put the special features DVDs in there.
[6840.28s -> 6841.48s]  The real ones are under the bed.
[6842.04s -> 6856.40s]  Oh yeah.
[6856.40s -> 6857.92s]  You're asking to get robbed.
[6857.92s -> 6859.76s]  You got all the Spongebob DVDs.
[6860.32s -> 6862.59s]  All right.
[6862.59s -> 6863.47s]  What about this one?
[6863.47s -> 6869.47s]  What about all the limited edition Happy Meal toys?
[6871.36s -> 6872.88s]  They're all under there too.
[6872.88s -> 6875.29s]  Guys, I have a quadruple king.
[6876.36s -> 6877.88s]  The bed is the floor.
[6878.52s -> 6879.80s]  I had it specially built.
[6880.36s -> 6882.78s]  You know, you open up somebody's bedroom
[6882.78s -> 6884.78s]  and there's, oh, there's carpet and there's the bed.
[6884.78s -> 6885.50s]  And no, no, no.
[6885.50s -> 6887.34s]  You open up the door to my bedroom
[6887.34s -> 6889.58s]  and the ground is a king size bed.
[6889.58s -> 6890.46s]  The ground is a bed.
[6892.43s -> 6893.55s]  You have to like open
[6893.55s -> 6895.23s]  and this like made it a special foam
[6895.23s -> 6896.35s]  where there's enough for the door to open
[6896.35s -> 6897.87s]  and then you just kind of climb on.
[6897.87s -> 6905.47s]  It's possible to climb the second floor.
[6905.47s -> 6908.83s]  I want a possible loot location on 104
[6908.83s -> 6910.19s]  because that's the one I can get into, right?
[6910.75s -> 6917.50s]  It's no wonder it took you six weeks to move here.
[6917.50s -> 6920.22s]  I mean, it was an incredibly elaborate project.
[6920.94s -> 6922.86s]  It's like $445,000.
[6924.14s -> 6927.72s]  And the whole, I don't know if it was weird
[6927.72s -> 6929.32s]  because the whole time that the workers were making it
[6929.32s -> 6930.12s]  they were like laughing
[6932.62s -> 6933.74s]  but the door would be closed
[6933.74s -> 6936.70s]  and I would just hear them fucking hysterically laughing
[6936.70s -> 6937.98s]  while they were doing it.
[6937.98s -> 6939.92s]  And I would just pop in like, you know,
[6939.92s -> 6942.88s]  hey boys, like boys, what's going on in here?
[6942.88s -> 6943.84s]  And they'd stop laughing
[6943.84s -> 6945.60s]  and be like nothing, we're just like working.
[6945.60s -> 6947.90s]  Be like, okay, okay.
[6947.90s -> 6950.36s]  And I closed the door and like after like five minutes
[6950.36s -> 6951.32s]  I'd hear them laughing again.
[6951.32s -> 6953.24s]  It was really, really angering me.
[6953.24s -> 6956.88s]  All right, there's a pricey guitar in the garage.
[6965.84s -> 6967.52s]  They were watching the DVDs.
[6968.56s -> 6970.01s]  Yeah, it was weird.
[6970.01s -> 6971.61s]  Like I kept hearing like
[6972.49s -> 6975.13s]  really, really memorable funny SpongeBob quotes
[6975.13s -> 6976.09s]  from inside the room.
[6976.81s -> 6977.93s]  I was under the impression
[6977.93s -> 6979.85s]  that one of them could just do a really good SpongeBob.
[6980.57s -> 6981.93s]  I was like, wow, that one of them in there
[6981.93s -> 6984.73s]  can do a fucking great SpongeBob and a Squidward too.
[6984.73s -> 6985.77s]  They're like having a blast.
[6986.57s -> 6990.08s]  All right, if I got the money,
[6990.08s -> 6990.88s]  I might as well spend it.
[6990.88s -> 6992.32s]  Let's learn everything about 104.
[6993.20s -> 6996.75s]  So pricey guitar in the garage.
[6996.75s -> 6998.83s]  You can climb the second floor vines
[6998.83s -> 7002.11s]  and there's only one person there between 8 and 7 p.m.
[7002.11s -> 7002.83s]  So let's go.
[7002.83s -> 7003.39s]  8 a.m.
[7004.03s -> 7004.27s]  Go.
[7004.83s -> 7007.40s]  And that, what was, which one was that?
[7008.04s -> 7014.17s]  This is 106.
[7016.17s -> 7019.29s]  All right, wait no, 104.
[7019.93s -> 7024.67s]  So what time is it?
[7024.67s -> 7025.71s]  Between 8 and 6.
[7026.59s -> 7029.61s]  Is that 8 p.m. or a.m.?
[7030.49s -> 7036.28s]  So this person is out here from 8 a.m.
[7036.84s -> 7037.48s]  104.
[7038.28s -> 7049.58s]  I don't have anything else to sell I don't think.
[7050.30s -> 7058.32s]  The Jared Leto Joker laugh and the Squidward laugh
[7058.32s -> 7059.36s]  are the same laugh.
[7061.69s -> 7062.17s]  Are they?
[7062.17s -> 7062.57s]  Hold on.
[7069.40s -> 7071.44s]  Fuck, you're right.
[7071.44s -> 7074.30s]  Wow, it's the same thing.
[7074.30s -> 7075.26s]  They're the same laugh.
[7076.88s -> 7078.08s]  You're absolutely correct.
[7086.91s -> 7087.55s]  All right, 104.
[7087.55s -> 7091.45s]  We got all the intro between 8 a.m.
[7091.45s -> 7093.13s]  Let's just sleep in the fucking car.
[7093.13s -> 7093.93s]  I screwed it up.
[7093.93s -> 7094.43s]  8 a.m.
[7095.21s -> 7104.92s]  I bet you 100% German has done a Joker cosplay.
[7105.72s -> 7107.07s]  I have not.
[7107.07s -> 7108.99s]  I have not done a Joker cosplay.
[7109.71s -> 7113.42s]  All right, sleeping in the car until 8 o'clock in the morning.
[7115.53s -> 7116.33s]  Well, 7 a.m.
[7116.33s -> 7122.73s]  To get myself some time.
[7122.73s -> 7124.60s]  All right, run.
[7125.56s -> 7127.69s]  Another way.
[7128.25s -> 7135.84s]  All right, one.
[7135.84s -> 7139.68s]  There's supposed to be one person in here at 8 a.m.
[7140.88s -> 7142.32s]  All right, so the bedroom is downstairs.
[7142.32s -> 7143.36s]  That's really good to know.
[7144.16s -> 7149.08s]  Crouching in a weird place.
[7150.36s -> 7151.08s]  All right, we're fine.
[7151.72s -> 7154.28s]  Crouching in a weird place.
[7155.50s -> 7159.18s]  So I need 104, which is this one.
[7159.74s -> 7162.41s]  I don't think I can get in here though.
[7164.04s -> 7165.24s]  Is this the one that I couldn't get in?
[7165.80s -> 7168.14s]  It's not.
[7168.14s -> 7169.42s]  All right, wait.
[7169.42s -> 7170.62s]  We're going to wait until the person.
[7171.26s -> 7172.91s]  And god damn it.
[7172.91s -> 7173.95s]  I don't think I can do anything here.
[7174.75s -> 7175.80s]  I can't climb these.
[7178.57s -> 7180.17s]  No, I don't have agility too.
[7181.47s -> 7182.75s]  But I can get into the back door.
[7183.55s -> 7189.32s]  I'm going to wait for that person to leave in 10 seconds.
[7190.04s -> 7193.18s]  All right, here they go.
[7194.48s -> 7195.12s]  8 a.m.
[7195.12s -> 7196.00s]  Which way do you go?
[7196.96s -> 7200.03s]  You go over this way, it seems.
[7200.03s -> 7201.31s]  No, you're just going to circle around.
[7201.87s -> 7202.67s]  Out the front door.
[7203.47s -> 7214.00s]  I think I've walked around in a circle three times.
[7214.00s -> 7216.56s]  Okay, so there's somebody sleeping down there.
[7216.56s -> 7217.52s]  And they're the only one here.
[7220.19s -> 7220.51s]  What?
[7220.51s -> 7220.83s]  What?
[7220.83s -> 7221.07s]  What?
[7221.07s -> 7221.47s]  Put it down.
[7221.47s -> 7221.95s]  Put it down.
[7221.95s -> 7222.51s]  Put it down.
[7224.57s -> 7225.21s]  Put it down.
[7226.40s -> 7227.12s]  Put it down.
[7227.12s -> 7227.92s]  I can't put it down.
[7229.98s -> 7230.94s]  Lock the exit E.
[7233.69s -> 7234.49s]  Oh my god.
[7236.80s -> 7238.32s]  No, I gotta go.
[7265.12s -> 7267.44s]  That cop has a shitload of food in his mouth.
[7268.32s -> 7268.96s]  He got the call.
[7268.96s -> 7269.52s]  He was right there.
[7269.52s -> 7271.80s]  He's in the middle of his lunch break.
[7271.80s -> 7274.20s]  He's sitting there like eating a delicious fucking turkey club.
[7274.20s -> 7275.64s]  Then all of a sudden he gets like the call.
[7276.28s -> 7277.24s]  Oh shit, like.
[7279.80s -> 7292.59s]  All right, let's try this again.
[7292.59s -> 7296.33s]  Between 8 a.m.
[7299.37s -> 7302.24s]  And 9 p.m.
[7303.04s -> 7306.68s]  Fuck it.
[7306.68s -> 7307.88s]  I'm just getting in there now.
[7308.52s -> 7311.04s]  Because he's going to walk around a circle.
[7311.04s -> 7311.84s]  There's people right here.
[7311.84s -> 7312.88s]  Yeah, just I'm getting in there now.
[7312.88s -> 7313.52s]  I'm going now.
[7313.52s -> 7314.24s]  Get in there now.
[7314.88s -> 7319.45s]  Person right there.
[7320.33s -> 7320.97s]  God damn it.
[7320.97s -> 7321.85s]  Come on.
[7321.85s -> 7325.66s]  Try driving through the garage first.
[7326.54s -> 7328.38s]  The garage is right above this lady.
[7329.18s -> 7331.92s]  Oh, I gotta wait for this person to go.
[7335.58s -> 7336.30s]  Multiple people.
[7337.02s -> 7339.39s]  Who needs a neighborhood watch when
[7341.24s -> 7343.72s]  there's eyeballs on every single street at all times.
[7347.39s -> 7351.07s]  The neighborhood watch is just a connected group of people computers.
[7351.07s -> 7351.63s]  What do you want?
[7352.59s -> 7353.15s]  What's wrong?
[7354.30s -> 7355.50s]  What is wrong with this?
[7355.50s -> 7357.26s]  I'm just like I'm doing the same thing you're doing.
[7362.46s -> 7365.28s]  All right, can I get a second here?
[7366.24s -> 7366.96s]  He's gone.
[7366.96s -> 7367.52s]  She's awake.
[7368.48s -> 7369.36s]  She's going back to bed.
[7373.88s -> 7375.32s]  That's what a neighborhood watch is.
[7376.04s -> 7379.42s]  Am I ever going to be able to do this?
[7379.98s -> 7386.88s]  She's still asleep.
[7386.88s -> 7388.32s]  This is the perfect opportunity to go,
[7388.32s -> 7390.80s]  but I can't until this person is going to turn the other way.
[7391.76s -> 7393.39s]  You walking up here.
[7396.25s -> 7400.92s]  I'll have an opportunity right now.
[7400.92s -> 7401.42s]  No.
[7401.96s -> 7404.37s]  Okay.
[7406.59s -> 7408.49s]  Um, okay, right now.
[7416.94s -> 7427.08s]  Okay, I don't want this is this is that board game.
[7427.08s -> 7428.12s]  Don't wake daddy.
[7429.00s -> 7434.86s]  Somebody's an open window.
[7435.42s -> 7439.13s]  This is not even the right house.
[7439.85s -> 7442.54s]  This is somebody else's house.
[7444.70s -> 7445.66s]  Uh, okay.
[7446.46s -> 7449.08s]  I don't know where they are though.
[7449.08s -> 7449.64s]  They might be here.
[7450.28s -> 7452.06s]  This is the guy's office.
[7452.06s -> 7452.70s]  Nice painting.
[7453.42s -> 7463.52s]  I don't see anybody.
[7464.16s -> 7482.78s]  I need intel on this.
[7483.50s -> 7484.62s]  He might be in the other room.
[7485.34s -> 7487.16s]  He might be in this room.
[7487.88s -> 7492.65s]  What if he's in here?
[7492.65s -> 7519.84s]  Oh, come on.
[7519.84s -> 7520.72s]  You don't have anything.
[7520.72s -> 7521.92s]  Turn these off.
[7521.92s -> 7531.20s]  No, I thought that was a person.
[7531.20s -> 7531.84s]  That door is open.
[7531.84s -> 7532.56s]  Somebody's here.
[7532.56s -> 7547.58s]  Somebody's in the house.
[7547.58s -> 7551.08s]  Expensive, uh, expensive toilet in here, right?
[7551.08s -> 7552.12s]  Expensive guitar.
[7552.12s -> 7553.00s]  No, that's the wrong thing.
[7553.48s -> 7566.57s]  They're definitely home later tonight.
[7566.57s -> 7594.14s]  Oh, I got the routine.
[7594.14s -> 7604.89s]  Um, he's gonna be home.
[7604.89s -> 7605.39s]  What?
[7610.68s -> 7612.20s]  I shouldn't see in that.
[7612.20s -> 7614.68s]  Oh, that's a pants shit moment.
[7614.68s -> 7617.10s]  You just peek around the corner.
[7617.10s -> 7618.78s]  You make direct eye contact.
[7618.78s -> 7623.24s]  I need to get to the other house.
[7623.24s -> 7630.70s]  Is she downstairs?
[7630.70s -> 7636.46s]  Oh, can I hide in the bathtub?
[7636.46s -> 7636.86s]  Hide?
[7636.86s -> 7637.82s]  What can I hide?
[7637.82s -> 7640.84s]  That is a nice toilet.
[7640.84s -> 7642.04s]  The husband's gonna be home.
[7644.46s -> 7646.06s]  I'm in deep shit right now.
[7646.06s -> 7669.05s]  What would you even think if if you got home?
[7669.98s -> 7671.50s]  And you didn't notice anything strange.
[7671.50s -> 7675.42s]  The only thing that was weird about your house was your toilet was in a hundred pieces.
[7676.06s -> 7684.83s]  Just be like, I don't even know what happened here.
[7686.46s -> 7689.10s]  Like, honey, do you know what happened to the toilet?
[7689.74s -> 7690.22s]  What was that?
[7690.22s -> 7691.98s]  It's like a golden goblet.
[7691.98s -> 7692.86s]  Oh my god.
[7695.31s -> 7696.19s]  No, give me the remote.
[7696.19s -> 7697.15s]  I got a golden goblet.
[7697.15s -> 7697.87s]  I got that.
[7697.87s -> 7698.51s]  It's time to go.
[7699.39s -> 7700.91s]  I got the ultimate bonus.
[7700.91s -> 7701.87s]  I don't care about the TV.
[7705.85s -> 7707.13s]  Okay, I got time to go.
[7711.36s -> 7712.16s]  Now, where's my exit?
[7712.96s -> 7713.60s]  The husband's home.
[7729.42s -> 7730.30s]  Oh, there's a safe.
[7731.24s -> 7731.74s]  Safe.
[7732.70s -> 7739.79s]  Shit.
[7739.79s -> 7740.11s]  I can't.
[7740.11s -> 7740.91s]  I don't have any more room.
[7744.43s -> 7745.07s]  I gotta get out.
[7745.07s -> 7745.31s]  Out.
[7745.95s -> 7747.31s]  I have the golden goblet.
[7748.11s -> 7748.99s]  What more do I want?
[7761.18s -> 7761.58s]  Painting?
[7762.38s -> 7763.50s]  I can't.
[7763.50s -> 7764.30s]  I can't.
[7765.10s -> 7779.13s]  I can't.
[7781.64s -> 7782.36s]  Put it down.
[7782.36s -> 7783.24s]  Put the painting down.
[7784.12s -> 7786.28s]  I can't put the painting down.
[7786.28s -> 7787.24s]  I can't put the painting down.
[7788.94s -> 7789.26s]  Why?
[7790.44s -> 7792.52s]  I can't put down the painting.
[7792.52s -> 7794.40s]  I'm stuck in the wall.
[7797.84s -> 7799.84s]  My sensitivity just went up by a thousand percent.
[7800.91s -> 7801.39s]  Why?
[7801.39s -> 7802.19s]  What the fuck?
[7802.75s -> 7808.64s]  Why is my sensitivity at 5,000 right now?
[7809.36s -> 7809.60s]  What?
[7810.40s -> 7815.68s]  That was bullshit.
[7815.68s -> 7816.72s]  I couldn't put the painting down.
[7819.29s -> 7819.93s]  I literally...
[7819.93s -> 7821.21s]  The game broke.
[7821.21s -> 7822.41s]  I could not put down the painting.
[7822.41s -> 7823.29s]  And when I put the painting down,
[7823.29s -> 7824.49s]  my sensitivity was a thousand.
[7828.56s -> 7830.00s]  What the hell happened there?
[7830.00s -> 7832.84s]  You weren't pressing E.
[7832.84s -> 7835.00s]  I pressed E a hundred times.
[7835.00s -> 7837.24s]  And my sensitivity still screwed up.
[7837.24s -> 7842.91s]  What happened?
[7842.91s -> 7847.37s]  Do you see this?
[7848.44s -> 7849.32s]  Why is this so weird?
[7866.08s -> 7867.12s]  That was total horse shit.
[7867.84s -> 7870.12s]  I'm sitting there pressing every button.
[7870.20s -> 7871.96s]  E, click, space.
[7871.96s -> 7873.48s]  It's E, E, E.
[7873.48s -> 7874.76s]  I picked it up with E.
[7874.76s -> 7878.17s]  Something feels off.
[7878.17s -> 7883.40s]  Like really off.
[7883.40s -> 7884.60s]  Even my mouse in the game.
[7885.79s -> 7886.67s]  I'm going to restart the game.
[7889.44s -> 7890.40s]  Is it saved, right?
[7898.96s -> 7899.68s]  DPI?
[7899.68s -> 7902.24s]  Well, I don't know why it just changed in this game.
[7902.96s -> 7906.91s]  Did I panic hit my DPI?
[7906.91s -> 7907.55s]  I mean, there's no...
[7907.55s -> 7908.59s]  I don't have a button to do that.
[7909.15s -> 7910.68s]  I'm just going to reload it.
[7911.68s -> 7922.81s]  Yeah, very effective.
[7922.81s -> 7924.25s]  DPI button on your mouse?
[7925.21s -> 7925.53s]  Is there...
[7927.82s -> 7928.38s]  No.
[7928.38s -> 7929.82s]  I don't even have...
[7930.62s -> 7932.44s]  I have two buttons on my mouse
[7932.44s -> 7933.48s]  that don't do anything.
[7939.72s -> 7940.76s]  Yeah, I do have a death adder.
[7940.76s -> 7943.48s]  I've been using it for almost three straight weeks
[7943.48s -> 7945.64s]  and all the buttons don't do anything.
[7945.64s -> 7954.24s]  Let's see.
[7959.55s -> 7961.47s]  Why couldn't I just put the fucking painting down?
[7977.98s -> 7981.26s]  Why would I use a death adder in 2020?
[7989.87s -> 7994.14s]  Because I have like big fucking hands.
[7994.94s -> 7996.73s]  And every mouse I've ever owned
[7996.73s -> 7999.21s]  that's not a death adder is too small for me.
[8000.01s -> 8002.25s]  I swear to God, I'm not making that up.
[8020.32s -> 8020.56s]  Yeah.
[8021.20s -> 8022.56s]  Oh yeah, you guys are right.
[8023.92s -> 8024.80s]  You guys are right.
[8026.75s -> 8027.31s]  Watch this.
[8030.84s -> 8031.72s]  Why is this on here?
[8034.38s -> 8037.13s]  Let's put it all the way down.
[8037.13s -> 8038.25s]  Back to where it was, where it belongs.
[8039.90s -> 8042.46s]  Why would that be pre-programmed into the mouse?
[8043.26s -> 8045.10s]  If you accidentally fucking press that button
[8045.10s -> 8046.70s]  your mouse just goes to shit.
[8050.27s -> 8051.39s]  By default, that's on?
[8052.49s -> 8054.97s]  What kind of fucking brainless shit is that?
[8060.75s -> 8062.51s]  That wasn't on the original death adder.
[8068.52s -> 8069.56s]  Every mouse has that?
[8069.56s -> 8070.28s]  No, it doesn't?
[8070.28s -> 8070.52s]  Why?
[8071.40s -> 8072.68s]  I don't want that on here.
[8072.68s -> 8076.12s]  I want that to be like EAT or Melee.
[8081.72s -> 8082.04s]  All right.
[8082.04s -> 8084.04s]  Let's see if I can actually not press a button
[8084.04s -> 8085.96s]  and not be able to pick up a fucking painting.
[8106.92s -> 8108.44s]  No, get off of this.
[8108.44s -> 8109.16s]  I need to wait.
[8110.54s -> 8111.42s]  I had it too.
[8111.42s -> 8111.90s]  Like I just...
[8112.62s -> 8125.16s]  But that wasn't even the root of the...
[8125.16s -> 8128.49s]  God.
[8128.49s -> 8131.88s]  That wasn't even the problem.
[8133.07s -> 8134.83s]  Is E to pick up and E to put down.
[8135.47s -> 8136.60s]  And I couldn't put it down.
[8137.16s -> 8138.28s]  That wasn't even the problem.
[8151.36s -> 8153.28s]  How do those buttons get pressed by accident?
[8153.28s -> 8155.12s]  Because I'm trying to press every button.
[8155.84s -> 8163.50s]  I just want the goblet.
[8163.50s -> 8166.78s]  I already had the fucking goblet.
[8166.78s -> 8167.58s]  All right, I'm just going in
[8167.58s -> 8169.18s]  and I'm smashing windows and taking it.
[8169.74s -> 8191.95s]  All right, what time is it?
[8192.51s -> 8193.40s]  All right, he's gone.
[8194.12s -> 8194.76s]  That doesn't even matter.
[8194.76s -> 8195.32s]  Not even the right...
[8195.32s -> 8196.12s]  It's a different house.
[8196.92s -> 8211.13s]  All right.
[8211.13s -> 8212.36s]  I don't care about the painting.
[8212.36s -> 8213.08s]  I want the goblet.
[8222.81s -> 8224.25s]  Press E to drop a goblet.
[8231.52s -> 8232.16s]  Okay.
[8232.16s -> 8233.04s]  I want to show you this.
[8233.76s -> 8234.40s]  E.
[8234.40s -> 8234.88s]  Here we go.
[8235.96s -> 8236.36s]  E.
[8236.36s -> 8236.92s]  It has to be...
[8238.20s -> 8243.64s]  Why did it not work the first time?
[8243.64s -> 8245.40s]  I pressed this a hundred times last time.
[8245.96s -> 8246.52s]  I promise.
[8247.24s -> 8250.89s]  You understand?
[8250.89s -> 8251.61s]  Why is it working now?
[8259.23s -> 8259.95s]  Need room to draw?
[8259.95s -> 8260.83s]  But there was nothing else in the room
[8260.83s -> 8261.79s]  when I was here last time.
[8265.34s -> 8265.58s]  All right.
[8265.58s -> 8266.78s]  Where's that goblet?
[8266.78s -> 8278.16s]  All right.
[8278.16s -> 8279.04s]  Just give me the fucking goblet.
[8279.04s -> 8279.44s]  Give me this.
[8279.44s -> 8280.00s]  Give me out of here.
[8280.72s -> 8312.67s]  Fuck out of here.
[8312.67s -> 8313.47s]  Get out of the...
[8313.47s -> 8315.79s]  Get out of the window before I fucking freak out.
[8315.79s -> 8340.97s]  I'm doing some suspicious walking.
[8340.97s -> 8342.09s]  Didn't break the toilet.
[8433.66s -> 8442.36s]  Fucking Razor Death Adder DPI bullshit.
[8442.36s -> 8442.92s]  That just...
[8442.92s -> 8444.12s]  You hit that person.
[8444.12s -> 8458.09s]  It's a gamer button.
[8458.09s -> 8459.85s]  You wouldn't understand.
[8459.85s -> 8460.99s]  No.
[8460.99s -> 8462.83s]  And don't when I plug the mouse in
[8462.83s -> 8466.72s]  try to install your fucking like parasite software.
[8466.72s -> 8475.92s]  That's another thing.
[8475.92s -> 8486.27s]  66 bucks for this?
[8486.27s -> 8486.67s]  That's it.
[8486.67s -> 8488.19s]  That's all we got for that.
[8488.19s -> 8489.47s]  Oh, we got a lot of new quests.
[8490.03s -> 8490.51s]  All right.
[8491.47s -> 8495.79s]  Are you ready for this?
[8495.79s -> 8497.95s]  This is 104, 105, 106.
[8499.87s -> 8500.75s]  We're gonna try...
[8500.75s -> 8502.03s]  Break a window.
[8502.03s -> 8503.15s]  Break their TV.
[8503.15s -> 8503.95s]  Break their sink.
[8503.95s -> 8505.15s]  These are my kind of missions.
[8507.16s -> 8508.12s]  104.
[8508.12s -> 8509.16s]  Break the fucking window.
[8509.16s -> 8509.80s]  105.
[8509.80s -> 8510.76s]  Break this TV.
[8510.76s -> 8511.56s]  And 106.
[8511.56s -> 8512.76s]  Break the sink.
[8512.76s -> 8513.24s]  Back to it.
[8513.24s -> 8513.56s]  Let's go.
[8528.92s -> 8531.32s]  What's a brainless guy that came up with that?
[8534.09s -> 8537.29s]  I'm gonna rebind those to like a sound effect.
[8537.29s -> 8538.65s]  Like a fucking fart sound.
[8549.98s -> 8550.62s]  I'm home.
[8551.34s -> 8553.39s]  Oh, what's this?
[8554.11s -> 8559.71s]  What did I say I wanted to change to?
[8559.71s -> 8560.19s]  To eat?
[8560.83s -> 8564.97s]  This is like total fucking rage coming up.
[8564.97s -> 8566.33s]  I want to rebind it to eat.
[8571.47s -> 8571.71s]  Okay.
[8571.71s -> 8572.35s]  What was in here?

[8655.82s -> 8656.54s]  This just put me here.
[8656.54s -> 8657.10s]  I didn't do it.
[8657.10s -> 8657.42s]  All right.
[8657.42s -> 8658.30s]  So 106.
[8658.30s -> 8659.34s]  Which one's the sink?

[8961.23s -> 8969.53s]  She's not going to come in here, right?
[8969.53s -> 8973.13s]  What was that?
[8981.74s -> 9013.42s]  Where is she?

[9014.14s -> 9014.46s]  Where is she?
[9014.46s -> 9015.02s]  I don't know where she is.
[9015.02s -> 9015.42s]  I heard her.
[9017.80s -> 9019.16s]  This is open.
[9019.16s -> 9020.12s]  But is she right here?
[9020.12s -> 9022.75s]  I think she's right here.
[9022.75s -> 9029.63s]  I don't know where the fuck she is.
[9029.63s -> 9030.35s]  She's in this room.
[9033.45s -> 9034.49s]  I hear the footsteps.
[9034.49s -> 9035.45s]  It's driving me crazy.
[9038.92s -> 9039.96s]  Oh shit, the husband.
[9044.09s -> 9045.21s]  It was the husband.
[9045.21s -> 9045.77s]  All right.
[9045.77s -> 9046.65s]  We take what we can get here.
[9046.65s -> 9046.97s]  Come on.
[9052.64s -> 9053.52s]  Oh shit.

[9054.72s -> 9055.04s]  That's okay.
[9055.04s -> 9055.44s]  That's okay.
[9056.00s -> 9057.88s]  Where are they going to go?
[9057.88s -> 9058.68s]  Inside this room?
[9064.51s -> 9066.03s]  No, I'm so fucked right now.
[9066.67s -> 9071.36s]  Hiding.

[9072.16s -> 9072.40s]  Get.
[9073.20s -> 9073.44s]  Ha.
[9073.44s -> 9073.68s]  Uh.
[9079.02s -> 9083.26s]  So this is very hard without knowing when the husband's going to come home.
[9083.82s -> 9093.56s]  Unlock all the doors.
[9093.56s -> 9095.00s]  I like need the other tools.
[9095.72s -> 9099.64s]  I need like the other lockpicks.
[9100.36s -> 9101.88s]  I need like the electrical kits.
[9102.60s -> 9109.45s]  You could have just opened that other window to leave.
[9112.41s -> 9113.13s]  Could I have though?
[9118.91s -> 9120.91s]  Who locks individual doors to their house?
[9120.91s -> 9121.87s]  I don't, I don't know.
[9121.87s -> 9124.35s]  Why do you have like locks on every door?
[9133.44s -> 9140.35s]  If I had like a person in the house, I had like a tenant call the player.
[9140.35s -> 9141.23s]  We got two of them done.
[9141.79s -> 9144.78s]  The only other thing is break the guy's TV and uh, where is it?
[9144.78s -> 9145.26s]  105.
[9145.98s -> 9149.13s]  But I know nothing about these people.
[9149.85s -> 9151.77s]  This is going to be impossible without knowing that.
[9152.41s -> 9155.72s]  Didn't get the sink?
[9155.72s -> 9156.20s]  Yeah, I didn't.
[9157.16s -> 9159.61s]  How did I not get the sink?
[9160.25s -> 9163.00s]  Was it the wrong house?
[9165.42s -> 9166.54s]  Broke the wrong sink.
[9175.10s -> 9176.06s]  The kitchen sink?
[9178.27s -> 9183.13s]  What you broke wasn't a sink.
[9185.13s -> 9187.13s]  That was very clearly a sink.
[9188.76s -> 9189.80s]  It was a sink.
[9190.44s -> 9193.23s]  I don't have to get the kitchen sink.
[9195.93s -> 9196.81s]  Was it bidet?
[9197.69s -> 9199.29s]  I don't think I can leave.
[9199.85s -> 9200.97s]  I'm stuck here forever.
[9201.69s -> 9208.52s]  No, it's the, it is the right house.
[9211.71s -> 9214.75s]  So I have to run up and smash the sink upstairs.
[9230.62s -> 9231.98s]  He's using the toilet.
[9231.98s -> 9246.24s]  So you tell me this wasn't a sink in here.
[9246.24s -> 9247.36s]  I'm not breaking the toilet.
[9248.24s -> 9251.24s]  The police, like AI is like stuck here.
[9256.48s -> 9257.44s]  It's already open.
[9258.72s -> 9268.76s]  What is going to happen?
[9268.76s -> 9269.48s]  Is it going to close?
[9271.16s -> 9272.12s]  I got it.
[9272.12s -> 9292.60s]  What's she sitting on?
[9292.60s -> 9293.24s]  Okay, sink.
[9294.75s -> 9296.75s]  Oh my fucking god.
[9296.75s -> 9297.95s]  You guys weren't kidding.
[9298.75s -> 9303.28s]  They break the sink.
[9303.92s -> 9313.79s]  That was the same one that was downstairs.
[9313.79s -> 9316.16s]  That was the same sink.
[9316.16s -> 9316.72s]  Give me a break.
[9317.28s -> 9318.83s]  How was I supposed to know that?
[9319.39s -> 9325.88s]  Where are these police?
[9332.67s -> 9333.95s]  Can I please get out of here?
[9336.72s -> 9338.08s]  I have three stars.
[9348.83s -> 9349.63s]  What the fuck?
[9353.90s -> 9356.70s]  Broke a window and you're going to get a helicopter in here?
[9358.17s -> 9359.21s]  Is there a chopper?
[9365.93s -> 9367.37s]  I smashed a window.
[9368.70s -> 9371.58s]  I did the equivalent of like two kids playing baseball.
[9372.75s -> 9373.95s]  I don't think I can get out of here.
[9375.02s -> 9376.14s]  I think I'm screwed.
[9376.78s -> 9397.47s]  I wonder.
[9397.47s -> 9398.59s]  See this window is locked.
[9398.59s -> 9399.31s]  I can't open it.
[9400.73s -> 9402.41s]  I can't open this fucking window.
[9402.41s -> 9412.01s]  Ah, seen by a tenant.
[9412.01s -> 9413.63s]  The chopper is right here.
[9414.43s -> 9420.04s]  How am I supposed to get out of here?
[9433.87s -> 9436.91s]  I'm going to break a TV.
[9436.91s -> 9438.03s]  I'm just going to break a TV.
[9443.29s -> 9444.49s]  Where's the TV?
[9448.65s -> 9451.45s]  Okay, this is like, this is getting a little out of hand.
[9459.42s -> 9460.30s]  Wait this out.
[9460.30s -> 9461.50s]  I can't wait this out.
[9461.50s -> 9462.38s]  This is 104?
[9463.26s -> 9465.00s]  What do I need to do in 104?
[9467.77s -> 9468.57s]  What the fuck?
[9470.12s -> 9470.68s]  I'm done.
[9470.68s -> 9471.40s]  I'm getting out of here.
[9477.12s -> 9477.62s]  Uh-oh.
[9478.84s -> 9479.64s]  Uh-oh, wait.
[9479.64s -> 9480.14s]  No.
[9484.64s -> 9486.88s]  Just give me a mission to do.
[9487.36s -> 9490.08s]  I just need to level up to six and then we can keep going.
[9490.08s -> 9492.16s]  I'm not, I'm not leveled up enough.
[9497.88s -> 9498.92s]  Am I level six yet?
[9499.80s -> 9501.32s]  Can I climb fences now?
[9508.76s -> 9509.64s]  Oh, thank God.
[9511.64s -> 9513.48s]  Okay, we can continue with the tutorial.
[9514.12s -> 9519.52s]  That's Jilly 2.
[9519.52s -> 9520.02s]  I got it.
[9528.09s -> 9532.06s]  Um, is there a reason why we're not going on here?
[9540.51s -> 9541.95s]  Fucking DPI settings.
[9542.75s -> 9546.81s]  I'm just going to go home.
[9547.37s -> 9560.75s]  Fucking Windows 98.
[9560.75s -> 9565.37s]  Hey, you know what else ain't broke?
[9565.45s -> 9567.53s]  Is Greenview 104's windshield.
[9567.53s -> 9570.41s]  No, I, I, every time you make me do this, man, I fuck it all up.
[9570.41s -> 9571.85s]  And then I get angry at my muffs.
[9572.65s -> 9573.45s]  Welcome back.
[9577.23s -> 9577.73s]  Whoa.
[9579.82s -> 9580.70s]  I won't buy this.
[9580.70s -> 9581.66s]  Wipe it and we'll talk.
[9581.66s -> 9582.38s]  Oh, never mind.
[9597.76s -> 9600.64s]  Hey, go smash somebody's windshield at 104.
[9600.64s -> 9602.72s]  You know, you've been there like a thousand times.
[9603.52s -> 9605.52s]  You keep breaking shit and keep getting arrested.
[9605.52s -> 9609.04s]  And then you progressively get more frustrated at yourself and at the game.
[9609.04s -> 9625.80s]  And then you start blaming your hardware.
[9625.80s -> 9627.88s]  All right, so climbing gloves.
[9627.88s -> 9630.84s]  Why would you need 1200 dollars?
[9630.84s -> 9633.88s]  Hopefully it, that was a good, that was, that was not a mistake, I hope.
[9640.22s -> 9642.22s]  Break a car window in 104.
[9657.50s -> 9659.02s]  The gloves cost more than the car.
[9659.66s -> 9664.27s]  All right.
[9664.27s -> 9665.55s]  Break a car window at 104.
[9666.27s -> 9667.23s]  You got it.
[9667.23s -> 9680.36s]  It's going to take two seconds, right?
[9680.36s -> 9681.00s]  Well, I can climb.
[9692.97s -> 9694.09s]  Break a window.
[9694.09s -> 9694.73s]  Break a car.
[9703.93s -> 9705.53s]  So I'm going to break the car window.
[9705.53s -> 9707.37s]  I'm going to break a window and get out of here.
[9713.69s -> 9714.33s]  He's not home.
[9715.42s -> 9719.10s]  So I need to get down to the garage and break the window of the garage.
[9722.32s -> 9723.28s]  I can't carry this.
[9723.28s -> 9723.76s]  Put it down.
[9724.32s -> 9730.25s]  What else is in here?
[9730.25s -> 9731.13s]  I've got like an opportunity.
[9731.13s -> 9732.41s]  Might as well take it for a second.
[9735.64s -> 9737.16s]  Okay, he's going to be back very soon.
[9737.88s -> 9742.27s]  So we need to get to garage.
[9742.27s -> 9742.59s]  Car.
[9742.59s -> 9743.07s]  Here we go.
[9743.71s -> 9744.59s]  So I need.
[9746.59s -> 9747.63s]  Inventory is full.
[9748.43s -> 9753.58s]  Can I throw shit away?
[9754.14s -> 9758.60s]  Fuck the radio.
[9758.60s -> 9759.32s]  Give me the guitar.
[9760.60s -> 9762.38s]  Okay, break a window.
[9762.38s -> 9763.42s]  Can I open this garage?
[9764.62s -> 9765.42s]  Okay, here we go.
[9775.69s -> 9776.57s]  Oh, no.
[9777.13s -> 9777.77s]  Oh, no.
[9778.49s -> 9821.55s]  Get it open.
[9821.55s -> 9824.14s]  Holy shit.
[9824.14s -> 9824.78s]  What?
[9824.78s -> 9826.46s]  What was the thing that he wasn't even on the screen?
[9826.46s -> 9827.34s]  He wasn't even on the mini-map.
[9827.34s -> 9828.14s]  What?
[9828.14s -> 9829.93s]  He wasn't even on the mini-map.
[9834.72s -> 9835.92s]  What the hell?
[9835.92s -> 9840.64s]  He wasn't on the...
[9847.26s -> 9848.30s]  And he had a key.
[9848.30s -> 9856.68s]  I would have got out.
[9856.68s -> 9857.40s]  That would have been...
[9857.40s -> 9858.28s]  I would have made it.
[9858.28s -> 9871.18s]  You can only climb the fence in certain places.
[9873.16s -> 9874.52s]  None of which are here.
[9874.52s -> 9877.02s]  I have to climb up there and go down.
[9877.66s -> 9882.49s]  Why am I doing this during the day?
[9882.49s -> 9888.01s]  Because the husband is not there during the day.
[9888.57s -> 9891.92s]  Unlock it before you start.
[9892.56s -> 9893.92s]  Car parked in a strange place.
[9893.92s -> 9894.32s]  Hold on.
[9894.88s -> 9900.78s]  Come on.
[9902.96s -> 9904.24s]  I'm going to accidentally hit somebody.
[9904.80s -> 9908.57s]  The police are going to tell the car, come on.
[9909.13s -> 9912.80s]  I might as well just restart it.
[9913.52s -> 9935.04s]  Triple parked.
[9937.40s -> 9938.52s]  I would have got out of there too.
[9939.64s -> 9946.80s]  All right.
[9946.80s -> 9949.92s]  So I'm going to open up all the doors before I do anything.
[9950.64s -> 9959.52s]  Let me see how strange.
[9960.08s -> 9973.36s]  All right.
[9973.36s -> 9973.92s]  What time is it?
[9974.56s -> 9974.80s]  Four.
[9975.52s -> 9977.12s]  I'm going to sleep until 8 a.m.
[9979.15s -> 9980.35s]  Because that's when he leaves
[9980.35s -> 9981.47s]  and I have all the time I need.
[9989.61s -> 9990.09s]  8 a.m.
[9996.41s -> 9998.41s]  So she's sleeping.
[9998.41s -> 9999.53s]  This person right here.
[9999.53s -> 10005.00s]  I'm going to unlock all these doors before I do this.
[10006.04s -> 10010.33s]  I'm going to unlock this one and then I can get...
[10010.33s -> 10010.65s]  Let's see.
[10010.65s -> 10012.17s]  Make sure I can get out of that one.
[10012.17s -> 10015.69s]  I don't have time to do this.
[10016.25s -> 10022.56s]  Somebody's walking on the other side here, right?
[10023.20s -> 10024.24s]  I don't think I have enough time.
[10024.80s -> 10025.92s]  I have to wait.
[10025.92s -> 10028.86s]  I'll do this one first.
[10029.58s -> 10031.82s]  Because there ain't nobody looking over here, right?
[10032.46s -> 10052.54s]  Okay.
[10052.54s -> 10053.42s]  This one's open.
[10056.86s -> 10057.58s]  Open.
[10064.33s -> 10065.53s]  Thank God there's no fall damage.
[10065.53s -> 10066.25s]  All right.
[10066.25s -> 10067.53s]  Do I have an opportunity to do this now?
[10074.80s -> 10075.44s]  Not quite.
[10079.00s -> 10080.60s]  Put on the pink pantheon music.
[10090.99s -> 10091.47s]  All right.
[10095.80s -> 10096.36s]  I'm going to get it like...
[10096.36s -> 10096.68s]  Hold on.
[10096.68s -> 10099.16s]  Let me get it queued up so I can have it.
[10099.16s -> 10112.88s]  All right.
[10112.88s -> 10113.52s]  It's loading.
[10122.40s -> 10122.80s]  Whatever.
[10123.44s -> 10131.47s]  This is going to distract me.
[10138.44s -> 10138.92s]  Here we go.
[10230.62s -> 10231.58s]  Get out of the way!
[10232.30s -> 10234.14s]  Why is it always somebody here?
[10291.71s -> 10292.03s]  No!
[10292.03s -> 10292.27s]  No!
[10292.91s -> 10293.15s]  No!
[10293.15s -> 10293.95s]  I went the wrong way.
[10296.46s -> 10296.86s]  No!
[10296.86s -> 10297.50s]  Shit!
[10299.53s -> 10301.69s]  I thought there was...
[10301.69s -> 10302.41s]  No.
[10302.41s -> 10302.97s]  It's okay.
[10309.92s -> 10310.64s]  That's the wrong way.
[10310.64s -> 10310.80s]  No.
[10310.80s -> 10311.28s]  I can go.
[10311.28s -> 10312.24s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10318.19s -> 10319.31s]  What is playing right now?
[10322.36s -> 10323.08s]  Back up quick!
[10323.08s -> 10323.48s]  Back up!
[10329.48s -> 10329.96s]  Don't!
[10330.92s -> 10331.16s]  No!
[10332.20s -> 10334.04s]  God, this is fucking music.
[10335.00s -> 10340.27s]  Oh, I turned the wrong direction.
[10340.27s -> 10341.63s]  I'm going to have a meltdown.
[10342.19s -> 10343.79s]  I'm going to have a meltdown.
[10349.21s -> 10350.73s]  Why is this auto playing?
[10351.53s -> 10353.24s]  I think I crashed the game.
[10353.24s -> 10354.20s]  I did.
[10354.20s -> 10380.65s]  I can't even open the game again.
[10380.65s -> 10394.12s]  I like went down too far.
[10396.30s -> 10399.90s]  Distracting myself with fucking music blasted in my ear.
[10400.62s -> 10413.52s]  Trying to like play the game to the music.
[10413.52s -> 10415.12s]  Like just fucking do it.
[10415.12s -> 10421.05s]  Why would I do that?
[10421.05s -> 10423.74s]  There's literally no reason to do that.
[10426.56s -> 10430.72s]  I can't think of one single reason why you would play that song and try to do it.
[10430.72s -> 10431.76s]  It's difficult to do.
[10432.48s -> 10438.72s]  You know, it's like crap, man.
[10440.92s -> 10441.88s]  Did we crash again?
[10442.44s -> 10444.48s]  No, we're fine.
[10446.80s -> 10449.16s]  Maybe we're not.
[10449.16s -> 10449.40s]  All right.
[10449.40s -> 10452.44s]  Yeah, like I mean like what the hell would I possibly be thinking?
[10453.16s -> 10454.96s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10454.96s -> 10456.56s]  Like why would I do something like that?
[10456.56s -> 10457.52s]  That was just stupid.
[10590.00s -> 10590.72s]  Okay.
[10590.72s -> 10592.84s]  Here we go.
[10593.32s -> 10596.43s]  I got a very, very small loan from my father.
[10596.43s -> 10598.19s]  I think I have to start somewhere.
[10598.19s -> 10599.39s]  Wait, what?
[10600.19s -> 10600.75s]  Wait.
[10600.75s -> 10602.35s]  Oh, I'm freaking myself.
[10602.35s -> 10603.63s]  Why is this playing?
[10603.63s -> 10604.43s]  Why is this playing?
[10609.85s -> 10610.65s]  No, stop it.
[10610.65s -> 10612.17s]  I know I just did it.
[10612.17s -> 10612.65s]  I did it.
[10613.53s -> 10614.33s]  Get out of here.
[10616.67s -> 10616.99s]  Okay.
[10616.99s -> 10617.39s]  I'm fine.
[10617.39s -> 10619.55s]  I'm fine.
[10619.55s -> 10619.87s]  Okay.
[10619.87s -> 10620.27s]  We're fine.
[10620.27s -> 10620.75s]  We did it.
[10633.29s -> 10634.57s]  What is auto?
[10636.48s -> 10637.76s]  What is auto playing?
[10637.76s -> 10647.77s]  It's playing the Freddy Krueger theme song.
[10653.74s -> 10654.30s]  It's not.
[10664.03s -> 10665.47s]  Where did Trump come from?
[10669.71s -> 10671.20s]  All right.
[10671.20s -> 10672.88s]  Should I just keep auto play on the whole stream?
[10673.68s -> 10674.56s]  What do you think?
[10674.56s -> 10679.42s]  What's going to happen?
[10684.04s -> 10685.48s]  At least for like the next few minutes.
[10686.60s -> 10687.00s]  Come on.
[10687.00s -> 10690.20s]  I don't a D with a five stealth XP bonus.
[10695.16s -> 10696.28s]  I can't handle it, man.
[10696.28s -> 10696.84s]  I'm sorry.
[10700.91s -> 10702.11s]  I need lockpicking three.
[10706.17s -> 10707.45s]  Lockpicking three.
[10707.45s -> 10708.89s]  I need to be level.
[10708.89s -> 10710.41s]  I got to just get to the skill point.
[10717.02s -> 10717.98s]  Donald Trump shit.
[10717.98s -> 10719.82s]  Like, why was that playing?
[10720.70s -> 10721.64s]  What?
[10721.64s -> 10724.04s]  Even I swallowed about a million dollars.
[10724.04s -> 10728.04s]  Like, I just played fucking the Pink Panther theme song, man.
[10732.22s -> 10733.90s]  Okay.
[10733.90s -> 10735.66s]  So I just need to, I need to sell.
[10736.70s -> 10737.58s]  I have that guitar.
[10738.14s -> 10749.21s]  Apparently, I can't sell it here.
[10756.09s -> 10756.33s]  All right.
[10756.33s -> 10757.69s]  I will turn auto play back on.
[10757.69s -> 10758.09s]  Don't worry.
[10761.48s -> 10761.96s]  I'll get it.
[10761.96s -> 10762.28s]  I'll do it.
[10762.28s -> 10762.76s]  I'll do it.
[10762.76s -> 10763.40s]  Just give me a second.
[10764.68s -> 10765.48s]  Welcome back.
[10768.00s -> 10768.56s]  220.
[10768.56s -> 10769.04s]  I'll take it.
[10770.46s -> 10770.86s]  All right.
[10771.92s -> 10772.64s]  Here we go.
[10772.64s -> 10773.92s]  Let's get the auto play back on.
[10784.97s -> 10794.76s]  Count Dracula music time.
[10794.76s -> 10795.26s]  All right.
[10798.78s -> 10799.18s]  Jaws?
[10803.18s -> 10805.10s]  Why is this a horror movie theme song?

[10872.27s -> 10873.71s]  Somebody stop him.
[10873.71s -> 10874.59s]  I just did the other one.
[10877.76s -> 10878.80s]  They following me out here?
[10884.06s -> 10885.34s]  How long is this video?
[10885.34s -> 10886.30s]  This is a long one.
[10890.59s -> 10891.31s]  I know this one.
[10891.87s -> 10892.67s]  This is soft.
[10893.79s -> 10894.59s]  And it's loud.
[10895.55s -> 10910.94s]  Please like if you enjoyed the music.
[10910.94s -> 10911.58s]  Okay.

[10932.30s -> 10934.38s]  I just saw like the guy like, we need your help.
[10934.38s -> 10935.18s]  Whatever his name is.
[10935.18s -> 10936.06s]  And he was like one here.
[10936.06s -> 10936.54s]  He's up there.

[10950.32s -> 10953.04s]  Oh, we've terrorized these people for long enough.
[10959.96s -> 10961.16s]  It's Ghostbusters.
[10961.88s -> 10986.35s]  Come on.
[10987.82s -> 10988.94s]  I'm going to turn this off.
[10988.94s -> 10989.44s]  Get.
[11003.47s -> 11004.27s]  That's an advocate.
[11004.27s -> 11004.77s]  Hold on.
[11006.91s -> 11007.87s]  Keep auto play.
[11007.87s -> 11008.67s]  Auto play is on.
[11008.67s -> 11009.55s]  I just skipped the track.
[11010.11s -> 11012.83s]  This is Nintendo me theme.
[11021.58s -> 11023.29s]  Okay.
[11023.29s -> 11023.85s]  This works.
[11031.90s -> 11042.46s]  I need a task, man.
[11042.46s -> 11074.00s]  I'm like, I don't know what to say right now.
[11075.34s -> 11077.98s]  Just sounds like this is like a Wii Sports menu.
[11080.19s -> 11080.75s]  What was that?
[11083.23s -> 11083.79s]  What?
[11083.79s -> 11086.70s]  A seat?
[11086.70s -> 11098.05s]  How do I get in their house?
[11114.11s -> 11115.71s]  I have to, I'm going to turn it off.
[11122.46s -> 11122.70s]  No.
[11122.70s -> 11123.50s]  What do you mean no?
[11129.09s -> 11130.61s]  I can't stand it anymore.
[11130.61s -> 11131.57s]  I have to turn it off.
[11135.10s -> 11136.86s]  I have to turn this off.
[11139.92s -> 11140.48s]  E?
[11140.48s -> 11141.92s]  I got an E.
[11141.92s -> 11142.56s]  What is E?
[11143.95s -> 11144.67s]  What is an E?
[11154.50s -> 11156.18s]  That's going to make me lose my mind.
[11156.82s -> 11158.02s]  I'm losing my mind.
[11161.09s -> 11162.93s]  Oh, is this like 40 minutes?
[11163.73s -> 11168.67s]  Do I, can I level up?
[11168.67s -> 11169.39s]  I can level up.
[11170.42s -> 11172.66s]  I think this might be like four hour remix.
[11173.54s -> 11173.94s]  Oh, hold on.
[11173.94s -> 11174.66s]  I'm getting lightheaded.
[11174.66s -> 11175.14s]  I gotta stop.
[11178.16s -> 11178.48s]  Okay.
[11178.48s -> 11181.14s]  I need lock picking three.
[11186.32s -> 11187.36s]  Vinny, what do you have to say?
[11204.75s -> 11206.51s]  Break or steal a big TV.
[11207.39s -> 11209.47s]  Oh, wait, I need like the device.
[11214.19s -> 11215.95s]  Somebody come to the stream.
[11216.59s -> 11218.11s]  Oh, thank God it's over.
[11218.99s -> 11221.23s]  Oh, I feel bad for the new people that come in
[11221.23s -> 11223.47s]  and just think I'm fucking weirdo.
[11223.47s -> 11225.07s]  Why am I listening to this?
[11226.48s -> 11229.20s]  No, it's going to play like a League of Legends remix.
[11233.79s -> 11234.99s]  I don't know what the next thing is.
[11235.79s -> 11239.95s]  All right, I need, do I need a new thing?
[11244.02s -> 11249.06s]  I don't have enough money for the lockpick.
[11249.78s -> 11255.95s]  All right.
[11255.95s -> 11257.23s]  This is just like Beethoven.
[11264.64s -> 11266.48s]  I think I need to make more money.
[11266.48s -> 11297.95s]  I hate this.
[11297.95s -> 11298.99s]  I hate this.
[11311.33s -> 11313.92s]  Oh, no, I have to turn it off.
[11313.92s -> 11314.80s]  I can't stand it.
[11315.76s -> 11316.96s]  I can't stand it.
[11318.40s -> 11319.63s]  What do I need to do?
[11319.63s -> 11320.43s]  Break the TV.
[11320.43s -> 11321.47s]  It's 500 bucks.
[11321.47s -> 11322.35s]  Open the fucking door.
[11332.14s -> 11332.86s]  Open your door.
[11333.66s -> 11334.22s]  Come on.
[11334.94s -> 11353.86s]  What?
[11353.86s -> 11354.58s]  What the what?
[11355.46s -> 11382.94s]  Okay, we're done.
[11382.94s -> 11383.34s]  Finally.
[11385.12s -> 11386.24s]  We can move on.
[11386.24s -> 11387.20s]  We don't have to listen to this.
[11387.76s -> 11389.60s]  No, no, no.
[11389.60s -> 11390.48s]  I don't want to hear this.
[11390.48s -> 11391.76s]  This is going to ruin everything.
[11391.76s -> 11393.68s]  This will ruin my whole childhood if I listen to this.
[11394.88s -> 11395.76s]  No, don't listen to it.
[11396.40s -> 11397.20s]  I don't want to hear it.
[11400.72s -> 11401.76s]  I don't want to hear this.
[11402.40s -> 11415.97s]  Boy, this one's good.
[11415.97s -> 11429.02s]  This one sounds pretty good.
[11429.82s -> 11445.81s]  You're right.
[11445.81s -> 11447.09s]  It's only remixes.
[11448.37s -> 11449.57s]  I'm skipping like five times.
[11452.62s -> 11453.82s]  Kirby remix.
[11455.42s -> 11456.62s]  Kirby remix.

[11466.30s -> 11466.78s]  Now I'm on-
[11466.78s -> 11468.14s]  It's not about winning.
[11468.14s -> 11469.42s]  It's about fun.
[11469.42s -> 11470.06s]  What's that?
[11470.78s -> 11471.66s]  Fun is when you-
[11472.83s -> 11473.39s]  Fun is-
[11474.43s -> 11474.91s]  It's like-
[11475.71s -> 11476.43s]  It's kind of-
[11477.39s -> 11478.11s]  Sort of like a-
[11478.99s -> 11479.71s]  What is fun?
[11480.35s -> 11480.51s]  Like-
[11481.31s -> 11482.59s]  Let me spell it for you.
[11489.15s -> 11489.87s]  Get in!
[11489.87s -> 11490.35s]  I got it.
[11490.35s -> 11490.75s]  I got it.
[11494.22s -> 11494.94s]  Where's the TV?
[11508.11s -> 11512.30s]  That's not a big TV.
[11512.30s -> 11520.78s]  What?
[11520.78s -> 11521.98s]  The cop is in the house?
[11523.01s -> 11523.65s]  Get off.
[11523.65s -> 11525.07s]  Turn it off.
[11525.07s -> 11525.47s]  I'm done.
[11525.47s -> 11525.87s]  Turn it off.
[11526.51s -> 11533.17s]  I'm done.
[11533.17s -> 11535.01s]  My overstimulation is over.
[11535.01s -> 11555.38s]  I hate this.
[11558.66s -> 11559.06s]  Okay.
[11560.78s -> 11561.02s]  So.
[11562.38s -> 11563.10s]  I need to get-
[11563.90s -> 11565.28s]  I could have just gone up there.
[11574.59s -> 11575.71s]  I'm so-
[11575.71s -> 11576.83s]  I'm so sorry.
[11579.23s -> 11580.11s]  I couldn't stop it.
[11580.67s -> 11584.62s]  I just had to go for like at least a few minutes.
[11584.62s -> 11585.90s]  I'm just very-
[11585.90s -> 11587.26s]  I'm gonna apologize for that.
[11587.26s -> 11587.98s]  Over and over again.
[11588.62s -> 11590.86s]  I'm gonna park and I'm gonna sleep and I'm gonna steal their TV.
[11597.44s -> 11598.08s]  Remixes.
[11598.64s -> 11601.09s]  Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[11601.73s -> 11610.85s]  This is a remix for every single thing.
[11611.65s -> 11612.48s]  Okay.
[11612.48s -> 11613.68s]  I gotta turn this down though.
[11613.68s -> 11614.56s]  This is not allowed.
[11614.56s -> 11615.84s]  It is absolute hell.
[11616.48s -> 11622.03s]  All right.
[11622.03s -> 11623.15s]  Let's wait until they're asleep.
[11623.79s -> 11639.52s]  I don't even know why that-
[11639.52s -> 11641.76s]  Oh, because we played the pink panther music.
[11642.48s -> 11646.51s]  All right.
[11646.51s -> 11648.27s]  I need to see when they're home.
[11648.27s -> 11648.99s]  They're asleep.
[11649.87s -> 11650.91s]  Leave the lights around in here.
[11652.29s -> 11653.49s]  TV's in that room.
[11653.49s -> 11654.69s]  I could break it and get out.
[11655.41s -> 11656.82s]  Or I could take it.
[11656.82s -> 11657.94s]  Can I fit it out that window?
[11658.50s -> 11662.94s]  It's possible that I could even fit it through the window.
[11664.29s -> 11664.93s]  Definitely not.
[11664.93s -> 11665.57s]  I have to just break it.
[11665.57s -> 11667.41s]  I'm gonna put it in a different room and break it.
[11667.41s -> 11668.90s]  Somebody in that one.
[11669.62s -> 11671.38s]  I can't even open this door.
[11675.02s -> 11675.42s]  Come on.
[11675.42s -> 11676.62s]  I can't even open that door.
[11676.62s -> 11677.50s]  I need a level three pick.
[11677.50s -> 11678.14s]  I don't have one.
[11679.23s -> 11679.63s]  All right.
[11679.63s -> 11680.11s]  We're just going-
[11680.11s -> 11680.99s]  We're just gonna steal stuff.
[11682.35s -> 11684.46s]  Try to get some expensive stuff.
[11688.64s -> 11690.64s]  Arrow in the knee dubstep remix.
[11691.44s -> 11693.98s]  Oh, that was a sought after item.
[11693.98s -> 11694.30s]  Router.
[11694.30s -> 11694.54s]  All right.
[11694.54s -> 11696.54s]  I'm not gonna get too cocky here.
[11698.94s -> 11699.82s]  Phase.
[11699.82s -> 11700.22s]  All right.
[11701.18s -> 11702.30s]  One more item and I gotta get out.
[11703.18s -> 11706.32s]  Maybe some money.
[11707.28s -> 11708.24s]  Oh, somebody's in there.
[11708.24s -> 11708.56s]  Hold on.
[11710.03s -> 11710.27s]  All right.
[11710.27s -> 11710.99s]  I got a router.
[11711.63s -> 11714.93s]  I can't-
[11714.93s -> 11716.21s]  Right here, I'll get another router.
[11716.77s -> 11717.65s]  That's two routers.
[11719.09s -> 11719.81s]  That's good enough.
[11720.61s -> 11721.65s]  Anybody outside right now?
[11722.21s -> 11725.42s]  Yeah, I'm good.
[11726.06s -> 11731.12s]  Okay.
[11731.12s -> 11731.84s]  Back to the car.
[11731.84s -> 11732.64s]  Let's sell this stuff.
[11736.94s -> 11737.50s]  Clean job.
[11738.14s -> 11740.82s]  No more fucking around.
[11740.82s -> 11741.38s]  Like, I've just-
[11741.38s -> 11742.10s]  I've let like the-
[11742.10s -> 11743.62s]  Just the bullshit get to me right now.
[11744.42s -> 11749.17s]  I need to sell the routers.
[11749.17s -> 11750.21s]  One of them was sought after.
[11752.27s -> 11752.59s]  Oh.
[11753.31s -> 11767.04s]  What?
[11776.30s -> 11776.86s]  4k-
[11776.86s -> 11778.86s]  Yeah, there's like 4200 people here.
[11779.50s -> 11780.85s]  I hope you guys are having fun.
[11781.57s -> 11787.62s]  Doom.
[11787.62s -> 11790.42s]  Oh, I'm not gonna play the Doom soundtrack.
[11793.02s -> 11794.70s]  I'm not gonna play the Doom soundtrack.
[11795.34s -> 11805.94s]  Do I have-
[11805.94s -> 11807.78s]  Do I have to play the Doom soundtrack?
[11808.34s -> 11810.42s]  Break the toilet in 105.
[11810.42s -> 11810.66s]  Sure.
[11811.38s -> 11813.09s]  Break the dishes.
[11813.09s -> 11813.97s]  Break the toilet.
[11813.97s -> 11815.33s]  Break all their glasses.
[11815.33s -> 11816.45s]  Can I do something that's not-
[11816.45s -> 11817.41s]  Smashing shit?
[11818.13s -> 11821.09s]  I don't want to just break everything.
[11824.06s -> 11824.30s]  All right.
[11824.30s -> 11825.58s]  I need some security tips.
[11826.14s -> 11828.22s]  They leave the balcony door open and I need-
[11828.22s -> 11829.10s]  I want their routines.
[11829.10s -> 11829.90s]  There's no one at home.
[11830.46s -> 11833.42s]  There is no one home between 11 and 2 at 105.
[11836.05s -> 11837.01s]  Possible loot location.
[11837.01s -> 11838.45s]  They bought a pricey painting.
[11838.45s -> 11839.49s]  Why am I paying for this?
[11844.10s -> 11844.74s]  All right.
[11844.74s -> 11845.73s]  Fine.
[11845.73s -> 11848.80s]  You're gonna have to give the people what they want, right?
[11869.49s -> 11920.62s]  Okay, that was Doom theme sped up by 1.5 times
[11920.62s -> 11921.90s]  and then I put it up times too.
[11923.49s -> 11923.89s]  There you go.
[11924.53s -> 11925.41s]  I hope you liked it.
[11940.46s -> 11941.66s]  Please pay attention.
[11947.65s -> 11948.37s]  That wasn't me laughing.
[11948.37s -> 11950.53s]  That was me for doing the trumpet
[11950.53s -> 11952.21s]  that we played for five seconds there.
[11957.44s -> 11958.24s]  All right.
[11958.24s -> 11959.20s]  There's a lot of-
[11959.20s -> 11960.96s]  I'm not gonna do the 108 yet.
[11960.96s -> 11963.17s]  We're gonna go back to-
[11963.17s -> 11965.33s]  I don't know what to do with 104, man, but seriously.
[11965.33s -> 11965.57s]  All right.
[11965.57s -> 11970.61s]  So 105, I need to break the toilet and break their TV.
[11971.33s -> 11976.45s]  So I need to get sleep in the car starting at 9 p.m.
[11977.25s -> 11980.93s]  I got until 2 a.m.
[11980.93s -> 11981.89s]  From 9 p-
[11981.89s -> 11984.50s]  No, from 11 p.m.
[11985.14s -> 11986.18s]  Until 2 a.m.
[11987.28s -> 11988.40s]  It's empty.
[11988.40s -> 11990.48s]  I can do whatever the hell I want in 105.
[12007.22s -> 12008.90s]  You can sleep backwards.
[12008.90s -> 12010.18s]  How do you go to bed backwards?
[12013.26s -> 12013.74s]  All right.
[12014.38s -> 12027.84s]  So 105, it is-
[12027.84s -> 12029.68s]  Well, we need 11 p.m.
[12030.48s -> 12032.98s]  We gotta be out by like 1 30.
[12033.70s -> 12035.86s]  Break the toilet and break their TV.
[12036.42s -> 12041.89s]  So here is 105.
[12043.15s -> 12043.63s]  There it is.
[12044.27s -> 12045.82s]  Just wait for them to leave.
[12048.10s -> 12049.86s]  Is there something I can climb in here?
[12049.86s -> 12054.50s]  Okay, I can break in here, climb up the vine, TV, bathroom.
[12056.06s -> 12059.10s]  Now we just have to be patient until 11 p.m.
[12061.07s -> 12061.63s]  Here they come.
[12062.27s -> 12064.69s]  Shut the door.
[12065.33s -> 12067.10s]  No, I need to be able to get in there quick.
[12067.82s -> 12073.52s]  Hydrate.
[12073.52s -> 12074.40s]  Come on.
[12074.40s -> 12082.40s]  Count it down here.
[12082.40s -> 12083.52s]  10, 10, 45.
[12084.16s -> 12088.11s]  I'm just gonna be standing outside their house.
[12095.44s -> 12096.56s]  They come out the front door?
[12099.14s -> 12100.50s]  What about this here?
[12101.78s -> 12102.34s]  When are they here?
[12102.98s -> 12105.14s]  No, that's this hard.
[12105.14s -> 12106.50s]  This is a lot harder for this house.
[12108.74s -> 12109.46s]  All right, here we go.
[12110.26s -> 12112.19s]  Coming out the front door.
[12112.91s -> 12114.51s]  I'm just standing here.
[12114.51s -> 12114.99s]  I'm just-
[12114.99s -> 12115.71s]  This is what I do.
[12116.91s -> 12117.95s]  All right, you disappeared.
[12117.95s -> 12119.15s]  It is now 11 o'clock.
[12119.15s -> 12120.83s]  There's nobody in this house, right?
[12121.63s -> 12135.95s]  This is 105, right?
[12137.63s -> 12137.87s]  Yes.
[12138.59s -> 12139.55s]  Okay, steal.
[12140.43s -> 12141.47s]  I can take it.
[12141.47s -> 12142.80s]  I can actually just take it.
[12158.61s -> 12159.97s]  Play through the fire and flames.
[12162.48s -> 12165.52s]  No, I'm not gonna play through the fire and flames.
[12165.52s -> 12167.44s]  What, from like 2007?
[12179.74s -> 12180.54s]  It's still good.
[12180.54s -> 12183.50s]  I know, it's a good guitar hero song.
[12184.22s -> 12187.71s]  All right, with time, we got a time check.
[12187.71s -> 12188.43s]  12, we're good.
[12189.07s -> 12190.24s]  Nobody coming.
[12190.24s -> 12194.98s]  Okay, we got the TV.
[12194.98s -> 12196.26s]  Now we need to break the toilet.
[12197.97s -> 12198.45s]  Nobody here.
[12198.45s -> 12199.01s]  I can stick-
[12199.01s -> 12200.21s]  Ooh, chessboard.
[12200.93s -> 12204.62s]  That's all I can take, apparently.
[12205.18s -> 12209.07s]  Can I fit more than one thing in the car?
[12211.09s -> 12211.81s]  I wish I could see.
[12212.37s -> 12226.45s]  What's wrong with me?
[12227.01s -> 12229.38s]  All right, we're getting close here.
[12229.38s -> 12229.70s]  I gotta get-
[12229.70s -> 12230.50s]  I gotta hurry up and do this.
[12236.90s -> 12237.54s]  Ow.
[12237.54s -> 12247.66s]  Me serious.
[12247.66s -> 12248.94s]  I can't fit more than one thing in the car.
[12248.94s -> 12249.58s]  What's worth more?
[12250.30s -> 12253.94s]  This one is 10 experience.
[12255.12s -> 12258.53s]  And if I can't have it, nobody can.
[12259.65s -> 12268.66s]  Break the toilet.
[12294.13s -> 12294.45s]  No!
[12295.41s -> 12296.13s]  No!
[12296.13s -> 12296.53s]  What?
[12297.17s -> 12297.49s]  No!
[12298.53s -> 12298.77s]  No!
[12299.33s -> 12304.32s]  How?
[12304.32s -> 12305.20s]  How did this happen?
[12306.77s -> 12307.41s]  Get me out of here.
[12307.41s -> 12307.81s]  Come on!
[12308.61s -> 12339.79s]  It doesn't-
[12339.79s -> 12346.38s]  I don't understand.
[12346.38s -> 12353.92s]  How did I even get in here?
[12353.92s -> 12355.14s]  Lean out.
[12355.14s -> 12355.86s]  Lean out.
[12356.42s -> 12356.74s]  Lean-
[12356.74s -> 12358.66s]  Freeze!
[12358.66s -> 12376.13s]  I don't even know how I got stuck in there.
[12376.13s -> 12379.36s]  I turned the corner and like I bumped into the-
[12379.36s -> 12388.91s]  I'm gonna have to do that again.
[12388.91s -> 12389.47s]  I have to-
[12389.47s -> 12390.11s]  What is it?
[12390.11s -> 12391.39s]  Nine, 10 o'clock.
[12391.39s -> 12392.11s]  God.
[12392.11s -> 12393.39s]  I'm gonna do it real quick.
[12394.19s -> 12395.07s]  Keep the trunk open.
[12395.95s -> 12398.08s]  That was my fault?
[12400.53s -> 12401.89s]  Why was it my fault?
[12402.83s -> 12405.31s]  Because I ran and bumped into the wall?
[12414.94s -> 12416.38s]  You should have fl-
[12416.38s -> 12417.58s]  Your ass is too big.
[12422.40s -> 12431.41s]  I should have just slept till-
[12431.41s -> 12432.93s]  I'm just gonna go sleep till 11.
[12436.38s -> 12437.26s]  Park next to the house.
[12437.26s -> 12438.22s]  No, that's suspicious.
[12439.10s -> 12439.82s]  That's suspicious.
[12439.82s -> 12440.38s]  I can't do that.
[12440.94s -> 12446.46s]  No, sleep in the car.
[12456.24s -> 12457.44s]  Park in their garage.
[12458.08s -> 12459.20s]  I can't even open their garage.
[12459.20s -> 12461.36s]  I don't have a garage door opener, guys.
[12462.08s -> 12469.20s]  Let's make this quick.
[12469.20s -> 12484.61s]  Break the toilet first.
[12485.09s -> 12486.69s]  I know, I know.
[12486.69s -> 12488.29s]  I know I should have done that.
[12488.29s -> 12489.73s]  Why am I doing it like this?
[12491.41s -> 12492.93s]  Toilet first, you muppet.
[12494.59s -> 12495.79s]  But it was-
[12495.79s -> 12496.35s]  I had-
[12496.35s -> 12497.55s]  Ah, forget it.
[12498.11s -> 12499.23s]  Get the TV to last.
[12499.23s -> 12500.75s]  I know, I know these things.
[12500.75s -> 12503.07s]  But I'm so stupid that I did it in the reverse order.
[12503.79s -> 12522.74s]  I'm gonna walk very slowly through this house.
[12523.38s -> 12531.95s]  Okay, nice and safe.
[12531.95s -> 12532.43s]  We're good.
[12532.99s -> 12533.95s]  Turn off the flashlight.
[12537.07s -> 12538.59s]  What is blinking over here?
[12538.59s -> 12539.71s]  Oh, break or steal the-
[12539.71s -> 12540.83s]  All right, can I take money?
[12540.83s -> 12541.55s]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[12542.83s -> 12544.67s]  I can't take the stereo or the receiver.
[12546.11s -> 12547.15s]  Can't take anything else.
[12547.79s -> 12548.78s]  I can take-
[12548.78s -> 12549.42s]  No, I can't take this.
[12549.42s -> 12550.14s]  It doesn't fit in the car.
[12550.70s -> 12558.99s]  Does anyone want to break people's plates too?
[12560.19s -> 12561.15s]  It's in the other place.
[12561.15s -> 12562.27s]  Okay, that's it, right?
[12562.27s -> 12563.31s]  Good, go, go.
[12564.11s -> 12568.50s]  Somebody's here.
[12569.06s -> 12572.42s]  Forget about the ride.
[12572.42s -> 12573.38s]  Gotta run with the crowbar.
[12574.26s -> 12581.14s]  All right, time to go.
[12581.70s -> 12591.28s]  Other house?
[12591.28s -> 12591.68s]  I need-
[12591.68s -> 12593.28s]  I need more information on those houses.
[12596.54s -> 12597.42s]  Raid the fridge, yeah.
[12597.98s -> 12599.02s]  All right, that was perfect.
[12600.30s -> 12601.10s]  How was that a B?
[12601.10s -> 12602.46s]  I did it exquisitely.
[12603.10s -> 12606.78s]  All right, I gotta sell that TV.
[12607.34s -> 12612.94s]  What do I got?
[12612.94s -> 12620.98s]  $8.95, car parts, electronics, kitchen, other, antiques.
[12624.00s -> 12624.96s]  All this takes place here.
[12624.96s -> 12625.84s]  Okay, $107.
[12627.70s -> 12629.78s]  I can't do $107 until I get the better-
[12629.78s -> 12630.90s]  I don't think I can do either one of these.
[12631.62s -> 12635.62s]  I think I can sneak into $106 if I break the window or something,
[12635.62s -> 12638.50s]  but I need the level three, this one.
[12639.22s -> 12641.39s]  That's $1,200.
[12644.67s -> 12645.79s]  Okay, what do I got for Intel?
[12646.11s -> 12648.34s]  No, $104.
[12648.34s -> 12650.34s]  I got two of these done.
[12650.34s -> 12650.90s]  Nothing to-
[12650.90s -> 12652.02s]  Okay, $106.
[12653.25s -> 12655.33s]  Break the sink, break the dishes, info.
[12655.97s -> 12658.61s]  They leave the window open in the back, right?
[12658.61s -> 12661.09s]  So that's the only time that nobody's there.
[12661.89s -> 12663.49s]  $107, no nothing.
[12663.49s -> 12664.77s]  $108, I know nothing.
[12665.33s -> 12666.77s]  They leave the window open on the second floor.
[12666.77s -> 12667.89s]  I could probably sneak in there.
[12668.85s -> 12670.91s]  Break or steal the big TV?
[12670.91s -> 12674.35s]  I can't know because the TV's in the room with the guy with the harder lock.
[12674.35s -> 12674.91s]  I can't do it.
[12679.06s -> 12680.82s]  Uh, I'm gonna say let's do $106.
[12684.98s -> 12688.00s]  Let's actually stake this place up
[12688.56s -> 12691.12s]  because I need to do break the sink and break the dishes.
[12691.12s -> 12693.68s]  So let's go to $106 after I sell the TV.
[12704.32s -> 12707.52s]  All right, big TV.
[12708.24s -> 12709.60s]  Hopefully it's worth something.
[12710.24s -> 12716.19s]  Here you go.
[12716.19s -> 12716.75s]  Welcome back.
[12717.47s -> 12719.34s]  What do you take for a big TV?
[12719.34s -> 12720.14s]  $120.
[12721.02s -> 12723.73s]  How do I unlock that?
[12724.37s -> 12733.38s]  I won't buy this.
[12733.38s -> 12734.26s]  Wipe it and we'll talk.
[12735.06s -> 12741.33s]  Okay, $106.
[12742.29s -> 12743.17s]  Time for a stakeout.
[12751.10s -> 12752.06s]  Wipe it with a cloth.
[12752.86s -> 12754.58s]  I'm not sure that's how it works.
[12755.30s -> 12759.23s]  It'd be really easy to delete your whole phone that way.
[12760.11s -> 12762.61s]  All right, $106.
[12763.25s -> 12766.72s]  Let's get a good stakeout position.
[12788.24s -> 12789.52s]  All right, so what time is it right now?
[12789.52s -> 12792.08s]  It is currently 2, 11 a.m.
[12793.04s -> 12795.92s]  So I need to find out what these, where they are here now.
[12795.92s -> 12797.44s]  Are they here or are they not here?
[12798.16s -> 12802.16s]  It's a decent question.
[12802.72s -> 12804.51s]  Everything I need to do is upstairs.
[12804.51s -> 12805.79s]  Break the dishes, break the sink.
[12808.30s -> 12809.42s]  And they have a pricey painting.
[12809.42s -> 12810.78s]  They got a lot of stuff in $106.
[12818.70s -> 12822.42s]  $106.
[12823.86s -> 12831.14s]  Front door can be opened and I've got to wait till no one...
[12831.78s -> 12833.82s]  Is no one taking the living room or anything?
[12834.46s -> 12838.40s]  Wait for this person to get out of here.
[12839.12s -> 12843.86s]  This is what purgatory is like.
[12843.86s -> 12847.62s]  There's just nine families and one man just tries to rob you for all eternity.
[12851.92s -> 12853.28s]  Just have to deal with this one guy.
[12855.89s -> 12859.01s]  I would also probably either move or try to catch this person.
[12862.21s -> 12863.09s]  Change the locks.
[12863.73s -> 12865.17s]  Not that that really does anything.
[12865.17s -> 12865.73s]  All right, we're in.
[12868.38s -> 12872.88s]  Okay, so I know that right now, they're going to be getting up fairly soon here.
[12872.88s -> 12875.04s]  So I need to break this sink and break their dishes.
[12875.04s -> 12877.68s]  And then they leave the window open in the back.
[12878.40s -> 12881.04s]  So this window here, okay, this is the painting.
[12882.21s -> 12884.05s]  So should I just get the heck out of here?
[12884.05s -> 12884.93s]  You know what I'm saying?
[12884.93s -> 12886.77s]  I think I'm just going to get the heck out of here with this painting.
[12910.38s -> 12911.90s]  Yeah, I just wanted to see if the...
[12911.90s -> 12914.54s]  I was seeing if the toilet was down here, but they're all upstairs.
[12915.34s -> 12918.58s]  But I can get intel.
[12918.58s -> 12919.22s]  Hold on.
[12919.22s -> 12919.72s]  Intel.
[12934.34s -> 12935.22s]  I can't get intel here?
[12935.86s -> 12937.26s]  Let me go get it.
[12937.98s -> 12939.11s]  Okay.
[12939.49s -> 12942.48s]  That guy's not going to wake up.
[12942.48s -> 12943.12s]  Okay, I got to...
[12944.08s -> 12944.88s]  They're really...
[12944.88s -> 12946.48s]  I don't think there's any real window there.
[12947.20s -> 12952.77s]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[12953.41s -> 12955.17s]  We're going to prop the door open.
[12956.69s -> 12957.19s]  Don't!
[12957.81s -> 12958.85s]  Okay, they're fine.
[12958.85s -> 12962.86s]  I'm going to get this out the door, like right here.
[12963.82s -> 12965.02s]  And then we're going to go for a...
[12965.02s -> 12968.56s]  We're going to smash the sink, smash the dishes.
[12968.56s -> 12970.64s]  And we'll sprint out of the house as fast as we can.
[12971.36s -> 12973.65s]  Here we go.
[12973.65s -> 12974.15s]  Ready?
[12983.95s -> 12984.59s]  What do you think?
[13003.06s -> 13003.62s]  Toilet.
[13004.34s -> 13006.02s]  I'm not going back to the toilet.
[13006.02s -> 13007.14s]  I ain't going to lose.
[13007.14s -> 13010.86s]  Have they not hear that?
[13010.86s -> 13011.74s]  It was all the way upstairs.
[13012.30s -> 13014.38s]  They probably thought it was the cat.
[13014.38s -> 13025.81s]  Let's get out.
[13026.99s -> 13027.39s]  Good.
[13027.39s -> 13028.11s]  Nice and clean.
[13028.11s -> 13029.23s]  Look, I'm getting the hang of this.
[13031.81s -> 13033.17s]  I'm figuring this out real quick.
[13033.81s -> 13035.07s]  You know what I'm saying?
[13043.90s -> 13044.94s]  After four hours?
[13045.66s -> 13047.94s]  Yeah, but hold on.
[13047.94s -> 13049.70s]  You got to give me a little bit of credit here.
[13051.26s -> 13054.14s]  Like 30 or 40 minutes of this was like
[13054.14s -> 13057.26s]  losing our minds like on acid to Pink Panther remixes.
[13057.26s -> 13058.14s]  So I don't...
[13058.14s -> 13059.26s]  You know what I'm saying?
[13059.26s -> 13060.43s]  Does that count?
[13069.47s -> 13070.03s]  1,500.
[13070.03s -> 13070.75s]  Let's get it.
[13070.75s -> 13073.49s]  All right.
[13073.49s -> 13074.29s]  I got the lockpick.
[13074.29s -> 13076.05s]  Now we can test it out.
[13076.05s -> 13078.53s]  I got the electrical lockpick.
[13079.41s -> 13080.53s]  So now I can...
[13080.53s -> 13080.77s]  Is there...
[13080.77s -> 13082.37s]  Can I test it on something?
[13082.37s -> 13087.58s]  I don't have like a training thing,
[13088.30s -> 13090.91s]  but I do have the new gear.
[13090.91s -> 13094.43s]  So I'm allowed to do it because now I can...
[13095.47s -> 13095.87s]  All right.
[13095.87s -> 13097.39s]  Lockpicking four.
[13097.39s -> 13098.67s]  Here's lockpicking three.
[13098.67s -> 13100.03s]  So I have what I need.
[13100.03s -> 13100.91s]  I have a point though.
[13101.55s -> 13103.76s]  25% more backpack space.
[13104.32s -> 13108.06s]  I mean, that's just good.
[13108.78s -> 13112.32s]  I mean, that's just good.
[13112.32s -> 13113.04s]  I'll just take it.
[13116.10s -> 13116.82s]  All right.
[13116.82s -> 13121.30s]  Let's go to 108 and break in there after we pawn the TV.
[13126.08s -> 13128.80s]  This game is like watching paint get a license at the DMV.
[13129.68s -> 13131.44s]  That'd be really, really entertaining.
[13132.50s -> 13133.62s]  That'd be awesome.
[13133.62s -> 13134.98s]  Can you imagine that?
[13134.98s -> 13139.02s]  Think of what would need to happen for that to be a reality.
[13139.82s -> 13142.05s]  So much going on there.
[13142.05s -> 13143.01s]  I would have a ton of questions.
[13147.06s -> 13147.78s]  Welcome back.
[13148.42s -> 13150.96s]  350 bucks.
[13151.76s -> 13152.32s]  I'll take it.
[13152.96s -> 13161.26s]  All right.
[13161.26s -> 13162.06s]  Break into 108.
[13162.70s -> 13165.07s]  How do you wipe the drive?
[13165.07s -> 13166.91s]  Probably with like an electronic hacking kit.
[13167.71s -> 13168.35s]  I would assume.
[13168.99s -> 13176.51s]  So how was it pronounced?
[13176.51s -> 13178.99s]  Is it is it jup or jup?
[13178.99s -> 13179.63s]  It is jup.
[13180.51s -> 13182.27s]  Because it's short for Jupiter.
[13182.27s -> 13183.07s]  So it is jup.
[13188.53s -> 13189.07s]  All right.
[13189.07s -> 13190.35s]  I need to case out 108.
[13196.98s -> 13197.30s]  Wrong.
[13199.39s -> 13199.55s]  Yeah.
[13199.55s -> 13200.35s]  We all love that.
[13200.35s -> 13202.35s]  We all love that big planet Jupiter.
[13202.35s -> 13202.67s]  Don't we?
[13203.55s -> 13207.57s]  Parking space right here.
[13214.21s -> 13216.77s]  Only real germamites know the truth.
[13219.20s -> 13219.44s]  Yeah.
[13219.44s -> 13219.76s]  Come on.
[13220.56s -> 13222.40s]  You guys, you got to be like a real germamite.
[13234.24s -> 13234.64s]  All right.
[13234.64s -> 13235.20s]  Time to case.
[13238.58s -> 13239.54s]  I don't know anything.
[13240.26s -> 13242.40s]  They leave the window open on the second floor.
[13242.40s -> 13243.20s]  That's good to know.
[13245.70s -> 13247.78s]  Like how the gift creator says jup.
[13247.78s -> 13249.38s]  So we can ignore you.
[13249.38s -> 13253.18s]  I mean, come on.
[13253.18s -> 13256.46s]  Are you really going to put like a rhesus rheses argument in front of me here?
[13257.42s -> 13258.22s]  Say whatever you want.
[13258.78s -> 13259.90s]  Okay.
[13259.90s -> 13261.18s]  We'll get some intel.
[13261.18s -> 13268.10s]  Now I want to go get a bag of rheses pcs and bring them up here.
[13268.10s -> 13268.74s]  You need them.
[13268.74s -> 13279.33s]  This can be open.
[13279.33s -> 13280.45s]  This is a simple lock.
[13280.45s -> 13281.89s]  Nobody around, right?
[13281.89s -> 13282.29s]  Let's go.
[13287.14s -> 13287.78s]  Whoa.
[13287.78s -> 13295.55s]  Wasn't very simple, was it?
[13295.55s -> 13295.79s]  All right.
[13295.79s -> 13303.66s]  We're gonna find a person.
[13304.30s -> 13308.32s]  Nothing in the garage.
[13308.88s -> 13310.64s]  Not that I can see.
[13311.68s -> 13316.11s]  I want a brick.
[13316.11s -> 13317.63s]  I've not seen a brick the whole time.
[13323.26s -> 13323.82s]  Holy shit.
[13323.82s -> 13326.14s]  This game is just actually Skyrim.
[13326.14s -> 13333.90s]  Oh, you didn't even come on me.
[13333.90s -> 13334.46s]  Like really?
[13357.20s -> 13358.16s]  Let's watch from a distance.
[13358.72s -> 13362.54s]  Are they still looking at me?
[13363.18s -> 13377.52s]  Somebody make an entrance here.
[13377.52s -> 13381.15s]  I'm watching that tail end here.
[13381.15s -> 13382.19s]  I'm going to be careful.
[13382.19s -> 13383.63s]  What about two stars?
[13384.35s -> 13386.88s]  I've done a good job of hiding.
[13386.88s -> 13387.68s]  Why would I get two?
[13394.29s -> 13397.01s]  Why would you pronounce it rhesus as rheses?
[13397.01s -> 13398.21s]  It's a name.
[13398.21s -> 13399.73s]  And you should respect the creator
[13399.73s -> 13401.17s]  by pronouncing it correctly.
[13406.34s -> 13406.82s]  Okay.
[13406.82s -> 13408.02s]  We're there watching TV.
[13408.90s -> 13412.91s]  I don't know where the police are,
[13412.91s -> 13414.03s]  but they're apparently still around.
[13414.03s -> 13414.27s]  All right.
[13414.27s -> 13416.03s]  So I know that somebody leaves here.
[13416.59s -> 13420.91s]  Why would you?
[13420.91s -> 13421.79s]  There's no way.
[13422.51s -> 13423.98s]  Okay.
[13423.98s -> 13425.98s]  So I know what they're doing for a little bit.
[13428.88s -> 13429.28s]  Living room.
[13429.28s -> 13430.48s]  They all go in the living room.
[13432.85s -> 13437.15s]  Back window is open on the second floor.
[13437.15s -> 13447.84s]  Who the fuck is opening this?
[13448.48s -> 13450.14s]  Are they leaving?
[13450.78s -> 13453.34s]  I think he's actually leaving.
[13453.90s -> 13454.70s]  They're both leaving.
[13463.02s -> 13464.70s]  Why are they over here?
[13464.70s -> 13466.22s]  What are you police doing?
[13466.94s -> 13472.16s]  How long are you going to do this for?
[13472.88s -> 13476.62s]  Can I climb this?
[13477.26s -> 13481.78s]  All right.
[13481.78s -> 13483.30s]  We're getting to the timeframe now.
[13483.30s -> 13484.26s]  He's out.
[13485.06s -> 13487.18s]  Oh my God.
[13487.18s -> 13488.22s]  Would you go away?
[13489.10s -> 13492.00s]  Is it Jerma or Jerma?
[13496.03s -> 13507.78s]  What else can I even do here?
[13519.97s -> 13521.25s]  I thought I could get away with it.
[13524.61s -> 13525.73s]  Again, he's not on the mini-map.
[13530.19s -> 13531.47s]  I don't understand the whole red
[13531.47s -> 13532.27s]  on the mini-map thing.
[13532.75s -> 13539.92s]  The police cars are the things
[13539.92s -> 13540.72s]  that are red on the mini-map.
[13540.72s -> 13544.06s]  So they just have a regular pedestrian?
[13547.55s -> 13547.87s]  Okay.
[13547.87s -> 13548.43s]  Well, whatever.
[13549.15s -> 13549.47s]  All right.
[13549.47s -> 13551.39s]  Well, it's weird that you can see me
[13551.39s -> 13552.43s]  all the way over there.
[13552.43s -> 13555.98s]  But I need to find out more.
[13555.98s -> 13556.94s]  So what time is it right now?
[13558.18s -> 13558.74s]  8 a.m.
[13558.74s -> 13560.42s]  I already know what they're doing.
[13560.42s -> 13561.22s]  I'm going to get up here.
[13561.86s -> 13565.86s]  Let's see if I can look through a window.
[13566.58s -> 13571.82s]  Somebody be in one of these rooms.
[13572.78s -> 13574.18s]  It's 113.
[13574.18s -> 13575.38s]  I know everything about 113.
[13575.38s -> 13576.18s]  Don't need to do that.
[13576.90s -> 13580.02s]  I need to get that intel again.
[13580.34s -> 13581.54s]  I'm going to go sleep in the car.
[13582.26s -> 13583.14s]  Just wait till night.
[13583.86s -> 13596.22s]  Go sleep in their bed.
[13599.52s -> 13601.28s]  Yeah, I'll go sleep right here.
[13602.48s -> 13604.96s]  Sleep like four hours or so, five hours.
[13605.60s -> 13611.38s]  Let's go to 4 p.m.
[13612.02s -> 13618.13s]  I just want to be able to at least
[13618.13s -> 13619.81s]  because three people in the house is kind of...
[13620.45s -> 13621.17s]  That's going to be hard.
[13623.79s -> 13624.67s]  Anything could be anywhere.
[13625.31s -> 13631.06s]  All right.
[13631.06s -> 13632.82s]  So all right, here we go.
[13633.70s -> 13634.90s]  So two people are out.
[13634.90s -> 13636.50s]  There's only one person in the kitchen right now.
[13638.38s -> 13640.86s]  So at this moment, I could climb up the front.
[13641.66s -> 13644.38s]  I could climb up right now.
[13644.38s -> 13646.06s]  I could climb up the front door, pop that open,
[13647.68s -> 13649.36s]  and then leave out the...
[13650.16s -> 13652.78s]  Yeah, I have to wait till these people are gone.
[13653.34s -> 13670.26s]  I'm going to have to worry about this in just a minute here.
[13670.98s -> 13672.34s]  He's going to be hanging out down there.
[13673.41s -> 13674.13s]  All right, let's do it.
[13674.13s -> 13675.09s]  I don't know how this works.
[13675.09s -> 13676.21s]  I didn't do the tutorial of this.
[13676.93s -> 13682.11s]  Apparently, that's it.
[13682.75s -> 13686.35s]  Uh-oh, somebody's coming home.
[13686.35s -> 13688.03s]  Somebody's home, somebody's home, somebody's home.
[13688.03s -> 13688.83s]  They're coming home right now.
[13689.39s -> 13690.35s]  See if I can time this.
[13690.35s -> 13691.07s]  When they go in the front door,
[13691.07s -> 13692.11s]  I'm going to throw it out there.
[13693.20s -> 13694.16s]  I can't get this out there.
[13694.16s -> 13694.72s]  I can't do it.
[13695.78s -> 13696.50s]  No, it's not going to happen.
[13704.03s -> 13704.75s]  I'm going to do this at night.
[13708.75s -> 13709.23s]  Put it down.
[13710.90s -> 13711.54s]  Really?
[13711.54s -> 13712.74s]  Why is the door not unlocked?
[13723.98s -> 13724.94s]  It'll be right in front.
[13726.72s -> 13727.92s]  They're not going to pick their TV up.
[13728.48s -> 13741.07s]  Just wait till it chills out a little bit,
[13741.07s -> 13742.83s]  and then go pick up the TV and go home.
[13747.86s -> 13749.22s]  You definitely have to do this at night, though,
[13749.86s -> 13750.58s]  and sneak through.
[13754.42s -> 13755.62s]  I'm not going to do it like that.
[13755.62s -> 13756.98s]  I'm just going to go get the TV.
[13757.54s -> 13758.50s]  I'm going to pull a car up.
[13773.70s -> 13775.62s]  Go arrest that guy, not me.
[13776.66s -> 13778.58s]  Arrest the guy that just drove you off the road.
[13779.22s -> 13795.54s]  Do the cops give up?
[13796.58s -> 13797.38s]  Eventually, yeah.
[13797.38s -> 13798.18s]  If you're out of the way.
[13798.82s -> 13803.28s]  We're good, right?
[13803.28s -> 13804.32s]  No, almost.
[13805.04s -> 13816.86s]  It's just like running around in circles.
[13816.86s -> 13818.06s]  I need to go hide somewhere.
[13818.94s -> 13821.34s]  Where is that car driving?
[13826.13s -> 13827.25s]  There's so many bins.
[13827.25s -> 13827.65s]  I know.
[13843.66s -> 13844.06s]  All right.
[13847.06s -> 13848.18s]  Search is now concluded.
[13848.74s -> 13850.69s]  I'm just going to get in this dumb thing.
[13854.27s -> 13855.39s]  So I'll just sit here.
[13856.03s -> 13862.98s]  Don't even tell me that I'm getting in.
[13862.98s -> 13864.50s]  This is why I'm going to get caught.
[13864.50s -> 13869.17s]  We're good.
[13869.17s -> 13874.37s]  Okay, 108.
[13874.93s -> 13877.26s]  Let's go grab that TV.
[13883.65s -> 13884.53s]  There it is.
[13884.61s -> 13885.65s]  The door is still open.
[13888.11s -> 13888.75s]  Free TV.
[13890.40s -> 13891.20s]  Thanks.
[13891.20s -> 13897.81s]  What are you doing?
[13897.81s -> 13899.52s]  Don't break it.
[13903.55s -> 13904.59s]  It's very nice of you.
[13904.59s -> 13904.91s]  Thanks.
[13906.80s -> 13908.96s]  If you found it on the ground, it's legally yours.
[13908.96s -> 13909.76s]  Is that true?
[13909.76s -> 13910.80s]  What's the legality there?
[13911.52s -> 13914.99s]  So if there's just TV on the ground,
[13916.78s -> 13917.90s]  is it legal to pick it up?
[13923.73s -> 13924.77s]  No, of course not.
[13924.77s -> 13926.77s]  Because it's on their property.
[13929.60s -> 13931.44s]  All right, but what if it was on the ground in the street
[13932.00s -> 13935.07s]  for more than three days?
[13935.71s -> 13940.27s]  Then it's yours.
[13940.91s -> 13946.42s]  Don't they have a scenario
[13946.98s -> 13949.06s]  where if you find like a bag of money on the ground,
[13950.22s -> 13952.54s]  you have to bring it to the police.
[13952.54s -> 13953.98s]  Let's say you pulled over on the side of the road,
[13953.98s -> 13954.62s]  you're taking a piss
[13954.62s -> 13957.18s]  because you're on like a 50 hour long road trip or something,
[13957.18s -> 13959.34s]  and there's like a suitcase on the side of the road,
[13959.34s -> 13960.54s]  somewhere in like Nebraska.
[13962.46s -> 13964.14s]  It's like a million dollars in cash.
[13965.23s -> 13966.99s]  You have to bring that to the police station
[13966.99s -> 13970.03s]  and then if nobody claims it within like two weeks,
[13970.03s -> 13970.91s]  you get to keep it, right?
[13973.57s -> 13974.29s]  That's how it works.
[13982.14s -> 13984.70s]  Yeah, you pick up a briefcase full of like 50 grand in cash
[13984.70s -> 13986.70s]  and you immediately call the IRS.
[13990.14s -> 13990.94s]  That's the first thing you do.
[13997.90s -> 14003.87s]  Want someone to see their own necklace at the pawn shop?
[14004.77s -> 14006.53s]  You got to break it down first.
[14007.25s -> 14012.02s]  Okay, learn a phrase of level two.
[14012.02s -> 14012.52s]  All right.
[14013.14s -> 14014.34s]  Yeah, from my understanding is like
[14014.34s -> 14016.90s]  so if you found $50,000 in cash on the side of the road,
[14016.90s -> 14019.22s]  first thing you do, just put it down, call the IRS.
[14019.22s -> 14021.30s]  Say, tell them you found $75,000
[14022.02s -> 14027.74s]  and say, yes, I'd like to report it on my income please.
[14027.74s -> 14031.30s]  What do I need for this?
[14035.07s -> 14036.27s]  So I need one, how many?
[14036.27s -> 14038.11s]  Level nine, one more level almost there.
[14045.33s -> 14047.17s]  And then another thing what you should also do is say,
[14047.17s -> 14048.05s]  oh, by the way, can you like,
[14048.05s -> 14049.17s]  can you just go back and like check
[14050.29s -> 14052.93s]  the last like seven years of my taxes?
[14052.93s -> 14055.33s]  I had really awful bookkeeping
[14055.33s -> 14057.25s]  and can you like just make sure that it was correct?
[14060.69s -> 14062.05s]  Go back like 10 years.
[14062.69s -> 14066.61s]  All right, dual retool.
[14066.61s -> 14067.41s]  I got to get these.
[14068.13s -> 14071.97s]  What if you found five bucks?
[14071.97s -> 14073.41s]  Yeah, call up and report it.
[14073.41s -> 14075.42s]  If you found like a $5 bill on the ground,
[14075.42s -> 14076.54s]  immediately call the IRS.
[14077.18s -> 14094.30s]  What about a penny?
[14094.30s -> 14094.80s]  Yeah.
[14100.93s -> 14101.57s]  What else can I do?
[14102.21s -> 14108.46s]  And make sure you're crying when you call.
[14109.18s -> 14112.98s]  Like if you and your friend split,
[14112.98s -> 14114.42s]  you go to coffee together.
[14114.42s -> 14116.18s]  So you and your friend go up to coffee and,
[14116.82s -> 14118.34s]  you know, hey, I got this man.
[14118.34s -> 14120.26s]  Oh, thanks dude, let me at least go
[14120.26s -> 14121.86s]  and give you like a couple of dollars.
[14121.86s -> 14124.50s]  And you're like, oh, thanks man.
[14124.50s -> 14126.58s]  And he gives you like three bucks in cash
[14126.58s -> 14127.54s]  because you put it on your card.
[14128.10s -> 14129.62s]  You have to call the IRS and cry.
[14129.62s -> 14130.50s]  Like, I'm so sorry.
[14131.46s -> 14132.50s]  I have $3 to report.
[14132.50s -> 14133.62s]  My friend gave it to me.
[14133.62s -> 14137.94s]  We were splitting coffee in a coffee shop.
[14137.94s -> 14143.55s]  All right, let's see, rent a thug.
[14143.55s -> 14156.54s]  Break their window on the second floor
[14156.54s -> 14158.30s]  and break or steal a decoration.
[14159.82s -> 14168.98s]  Okay, somebody really hates the Wilsons.
[14168.98s -> 14172.82s]  Yeah, I just got a dollar.
[14175.02s -> 14175.90s]  Oh, shit.
[14175.90s -> 14176.54s]  I got a dollar.
[14184.38s -> 14184.86s]  Hold on.
[14184.86s -> 14186.22s]  Let me, let me just hold on a second.
[14199.52s -> 14201.97s]  Yeah, yeah, that's me.
[14203.78s -> 14204.42s]  Got a dollar.
[14207.23s -> 14208.83s]  But that's not how it works.
[14208.83s -> 14210.11s]  It's not like it's a rec line.
[14210.11s -> 14210.83s]  Yeah, it's me.
[14213.76s -> 14215.12s]  I get to call every time.
[14216.98s -> 14226.94s]  Oh, it's me.
[14243.54s -> 14245.30s]  No, guys, pay your taxes.
[14245.94s -> 14249.82s]  Pay your taxes and just make sure you stash
[14250.54s -> 14252.62s]  at least like 10 grand of gold under your bed.
[14262.61s -> 14270.93s]  Wait, do I still have a TV in the back of the car?
[14271.73s -> 14280.51s]  No, I got a pawn shop.
[14280.51s -> 14281.79s]  No, 107.
[14281.79s -> 14283.74s]  I got to park it in a different place.
[14288.56s -> 14297.65s]  Yeah, I invested all my money in Spongebob DVDs.
[14299.25s -> 14302.05s]  Do I get like to claim like capital gains for that?
[14302.93s -> 14307.06s]  Spongebob, the season one Spongebob DVD original box,
[14307.78s -> 14310.16s]  I mean, has definitely appreciated in value
[14310.16s -> 14311.44s]  by at least like $40.
[14311.44s -> 14312.24s]  Do I have to claim that?
[14312.96s -> 14318.19s]  All right.
[14318.19s -> 14319.55s]  Oh, I just know I okay.
[14319.55s -> 14320.43s]  I park normally.
[14320.43s -> 14321.47s]  That's going to hurt my brain.
[14322.11s -> 14326.88s]  All right.
[14326.88s -> 14327.44s]  Well, here's the thing.
[14327.44s -> 14327.60s]  Okay.
[14327.60s -> 14329.68s]  So can I claim a capital loss?
[14329.68s -> 14331.36s]  So if the Spongebob DVDs,
[14331.36s -> 14334.48s]  if I buy 150 Spongebob DVDs
[14335.36s -> 14336.40s]  and 10 years from now,
[14336.40s -> 14338.16s]  they're worth like a dollar each
[14338.16s -> 14340.08s]  and I paid like $20 a piece for them.
[14340.08s -> 14342.24s]  Do I get to claim capital losses if I sell them?
[14342.24s -> 14344.64s]  You know, I invested in like 100 Spongebob DVDs
[14344.64s -> 14346.08s]  but I've sold them at a loss.
[14346.08s -> 14346.32s]  All right.
[14346.32s -> 14375.58s]  I got some mid sale.
[14375.58s -> 14377.34s]  Break or steal a decoration?
[14377.34s -> 14389.57s]  Okay.
[14389.57s -> 14390.53s]  Break the toilet.
[14390.53s -> 14392.61s]  Break the window on the second floor and break there.
[14392.61s -> 14395.17s]  This is a $900 job.
[14399.36s -> 14401.20s]  And I know nothing about the Wilsons
[14401.20s -> 14402.08s]  but we're breaking in
[14402.80s -> 14412.11s]  because it is 1 a.m.
[14412.67s -> 14413.87s]  They're probably asleep.
[14414.94s -> 14416.22s]  So actually keep this open.
[14417.76s -> 14419.73s]  So break.
[14419.73s -> 14420.77s]  They got a printer too.
[14421.41s -> 14428.27s]  All right.
[14428.27s -> 14429.23s]  Where's my escape route?
[14434.78s -> 14435.50s]  Why?
[14435.50s -> 14436.22s]  What's going on here?
[14436.78s -> 14439.97s]  Did they hear me take the printer?
[14440.61s -> 14442.83s]  Because they're both upstairs.
[14442.83s -> 14443.71s]  They heard me take the printer.
[14444.69s -> 14445.41s]  All right.
[14445.41s -> 14446.53s]  Where can I throw this over?
[14447.33s -> 14456.37s]  Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[14456.37s -> 14456.69s]  I can't.
[14456.69s -> 14457.09s]  All right.
[14457.09s -> 14457.49s]  Printer.
[14458.21s -> 14458.85s]  Garbage can.
[14460.03s -> 14460.99s]  Now break toilet.
[14460.99s -> 14462.51s]  Break window on the second floor.
[14462.51s -> 14462.83s]  Break the...
[14462.83s -> 14463.87s]  There's so much stuff to break.
[14463.87s -> 14465.47s]  I need to know when they're not going to be here.
[14466.03s -> 14467.23s]  I think I take the printer and run.
[14468.03s -> 14478.43s]  Break the toilet.
[14479.07s -> 14480.96s]  Break their wine glasses.
[14480.96s -> 14482.08s]  This is all spread out.
[14482.08s -> 14483.44s]  I'm going to make sure these doors are all open.
[14484.40s -> 14493.62s]  Okay.
[14493.62s -> 14494.18s]  Break...
[14494.18s -> 14496.02s]  The wine glasses are outside so I'm going to do it last.
[14496.02s -> 14502.69s]  So make sure this is open as well
[14502.69s -> 14504.45s]  just in case I have a panic attack and I need to leave.
[14512.38s -> 14512.54s]  All right.
[14512.54s -> 14513.26s]  Here we go.
[14513.26s -> 14513.58s]  Wine.
[14513.58s -> 14514.46s]  So I get toilet.
[14516.40s -> 14516.80s]  Window.
[14516.80s -> 14517.36s]  Toilet.
[14517.36s -> 14517.68s]  Wine.
[14518.32s -> 14519.04s]  Pop the fence.
[14525.33s -> 14527.01s]  Break the window on the second floor.
[14527.01s -> 14527.89s]  Which window?
[14527.89s -> 14531.17s]  Just break any window or break the window on the second floor.
[14531.97s -> 14533.57s]  Doesn't matter which one.
[14534.21s -> 14536.35s]  You know what I'm saying?
[14537.07s -> 14543.06s]  So if it's any window, then I can break...
[14543.06s -> 14544.10s]  So they're asleep right now.
[14544.10s -> 14545.38s]  So bang, bang.
[14545.38s -> 14546.02s]  Out that door.
[14546.66s -> 14548.24s]  Here we go.
[14548.24s -> 14556.94s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[14557.66s -> 14558.22s]  What happened?
[14558.22s -> 14559.18s]  Why did I teleport?
[14559.90s -> 14560.30s]  Why?
[14561.18s -> 14562.78s]  What in the name of happening?
[14563.58s -> 14578.51s]  Get in the toilet!
[14578.51s -> 14584.24s]  I got the printer.
[14584.24s -> 14584.64s]  I got the printer.
[14584.64s -> 14585.68s]  The printer is fine.
[14585.68s -> 14589.06s]  The printer is right below me.
[14589.06s -> 14596.43s]  Right in front of me here.
[14596.43s -> 14597.95s]  Oh, I didn't break or steal a decoration.
[14597.95s -> 14598.75s]  Oh, it's a different house.
[14607.50s -> 14608.54s]  I'm gonna see the printer.
[14609.66s -> 14612.22s]  The printer on the ground in front of where I'm hiding.
[14612.78s -> 14613.74s]  I wonder where he went.
[14614.56s -> 14615.60s]  No, that's not that smart.
[14618.90s -> 14620.50s]  Oh no, he's looking at the printer.
[14632.77s -> 14634.29s]  The TV's in the car.
[14634.29s -> 14635.41s]  Is the TV in the car?
[14635.97s -> 14636.69s]  I didn't see it.
[14643.86s -> 14645.46s]  No, there's no TV back there.
[14645.46s -> 14646.18s]  Didn't we just look?
[14646.90s -> 14651.34s]  I have a TV back there.
[14651.34s -> 14652.14s]  Don't say that.
[14653.78s -> 14654.98s]  You didn't sell it.
[14654.98s -> 14655.46s]  I didn't?
[14671.92s -> 14672.24s]  Okay.
[14677.89s -> 14679.97s]  I need to be, I gotta make sure this is correct.
[14680.77s -> 14682.16s]  Well, I can't go that way.
[14682.88s -> 14685.33s]  I can't go that way either.
[14685.33s -> 14686.53s]  I gotta wait till these people are all gone.
[14687.17s -> 14709.74s]  Hold on, this is important.
[14710.30s -> 14712.21s]  I think I can do another job here.
[14712.93s -> 14721.79s]  Well, get a better car.
[14721.79s -> 14724.11s]  Why can you only fit one printer in there?
[14724.67s -> 14732.99s]  Shit!
[14734.82s -> 14737.86s]  No, I can't put, I can't put anything else back here.
[14755.66s -> 14757.18s]  What an absolute disgrace.
[14757.74s -> 14763.90s]  But it's okay though, because now, here's what I'm gonna do.
[14768.26s -> 14768.74s]  Easy.
[14768.74s -> 14769.14s]  Hold on.
[14769.14s -> 14769.78s]  This is open.
[14772.40s -> 14773.36s]  107.
[14774.08s -> 14775.68s]  There's something to do here at 108.
[14776.40s -> 14779.04s]  So, break or steal a decoration.
[14779.04s -> 14779.84s]  The car's right there.
[14779.84s -> 14780.64s]  Let's go quickly.
[14781.44s -> 14789.17s]  I need to break something in their house.
[14789.73s -> 14792.38s]  Why is this closed?
[14792.94s -> 14793.95s]  Oh, fuck it.
[14794.59s -> 14797.70s]  They're gonna be like, oh, your car's in a weird place.
[14798.34s -> 14804.29s]  Let's just get out of here.
[14804.29s -> 14806.37s]  I'm gonna bring the TV back anyways.
[14807.01s -> 14822.37s]  You can't put it in the passenger seat?
[14822.37s -> 14826.53s]  What criminal goes in and takes one TV and leaves?
[14829.01s -> 14833.97s]  No, you go, you go find their bed and go onto their bed
[14833.97s -> 14837.01s]  with all the SpongeBob DVDs, all the gold, all the fucking money.
[14846.90s -> 14847.62s]  Welcome back.
[14851.22s -> 14852.02s]  700 bucks.
[14852.58s -> 14856.08s]  I'll take it.
[14856.08s -> 14857.68s]  All right, I got some money now.
[14857.68s -> 14860.22s]  I need a little bit more experience.
[14860.22s -> 14860.94s]  Close this up.
[14861.74s -> 14864.50s]  What do we got now?
[14864.50s -> 14866.80s]  We got 101.
[14866.80s -> 14867.60s]  There's nothing here.
[14867.60s -> 14868.24s]  104.
[14868.24s -> 14868.80s]  We already did it.
[14870.59s -> 14871.55s]  Nothing at 106.
[14871.55s -> 14873.63s]  107 is done.
[14874.59s -> 14875.23s]  108.
[14875.23s -> 14876.99s]  I need to break or steal a decoration.
[14877.63s -> 14884.16s]  On 11, I have nothing else on these.
[14884.16s -> 14887.84s]  I got one break or steal a pair decoration at 113.
[14888.72s -> 14894.66s]  I feel I'll do this one.
[14894.66s -> 14896.26s]  Break or steal a decoration.
[14896.26s -> 14897.46s]  So 108.
[14897.46s -> 14899.30s]  Let's case it out a little bit here.
[14900.02s -> 14903.49s]  I can't believe I played this game for four hours.
[14904.13s -> 14910.70s]  I'm still having fun too.
[14910.70s -> 14912.70s]  This is I'm having like a good time right now.
[14912.70s -> 14913.26s]  This is fun.
[14913.90s -> 14922.98s]  I can't believe it either.
[14922.98s -> 14925.95s]  I'm having like a good time.
[14932.99s -> 14938.98s]  108.
[14940.96s -> 14942.24s]  There's a parking garage.
[14944.66s -> 14946.90s]  Actually, the other one's probably a little bit closer.
[14947.70s -> 14954.05s]  Because I can probably hop the fence back here.
[14957.20s -> 14959.36s]  Let's learn about the people here.
[14960.08s -> 14970.43s]  Okay.
[14970.43s -> 14971.55s]  Break the decoration.
[14971.55s -> 14973.39s]  They leave the window open on the second floor.
[14973.39s -> 14974.51s]  I'm not tall enough to look.
[14975.23s -> 14981.86s]  I don't know where they are now.
[14981.86s -> 14984.42s]  This would be a good time to get some.
[14986.13s -> 14987.09s]  I don't want to break that.
[14987.09s -> 14987.97s]  They'll know.
[14988.05s -> 14989.09s]  They'll freak out about it.
[14993.26s -> 14995.10s]  Somebody look outside or do something.
[14995.74s -> 15001.74s]  Nobody there?
[15005.09s -> 15006.05s]  Is there no one here?
[15006.69s -> 15010.54s]  Okay, there's a person right there.
[15010.54s -> 15010.94s]  All right.
[15012.54s -> 15015.50s]  So it looks like they're all upstairs right now.
[15016.38s -> 15021.84s]  I could probably just sprint, smash, run.
[15023.71s -> 15024.03s]  Yep.
[15024.03s -> 15024.75s]  I'm going for it.
[15036.82s -> 15043.84s]  Where's the car?
[15044.56s -> 15069.44s]  Is that not it?
[15076.83s -> 15083.44s]  Drop it and destroy it.
[15083.44s -> 15083.76s]  Wow.
[15083.76s -> 15117.15s]  Why is it?
[15117.15s -> 15117.71s]  Oh, okay.
[15119.31s -> 15119.95s]  That was it.
[15127.06s -> 15127.70s]  F.
[15127.70s -> 15129.65s]  It's all right.
[15129.65s -> 15130.77s]  Sometimes you get an F.
[15130.77s -> 15133.78s]  No antiques.
[15133.78s -> 15134.50s]  You don't want anything.
[15136.08s -> 15136.96s]  We're almost...
[15136.96s -> 15139.76s]  I need to break or steal the pear decoration from 113.
[15139.76s -> 15140.56s]  And that's all we got.
[15141.12s -> 15142.48s]  We're at the end there.
[15143.68s -> 15144.32s]  I have money.
[15144.32s -> 15147.28s]  Jewelry tools requires appraisal too.
[15148.32s -> 15149.60s]  I can't do it yet.
[15149.60s -> 15155.30s]  Headphones.
[15155.94s -> 15160.30s]  So let's go get that done.
[15160.30s -> 15162.14s]  I'll be the next level to do appraisal.
[15162.14s -> 15164.14s]  And then we're probably going to get some new missions.
[15164.14s -> 15165.50s]  Maybe we'll go to a new neighborhood.
[15165.50s -> 15165.98s]  New neighborhood.
[15166.54s -> 15168.16s]  That'd be interesting.
[15174.70s -> 15175.50s]  Welcome back.
[15176.06s -> 15179.92s]  Okay, bye.
[15180.48s -> 15181.89s]  113.
[15182.53s -> 15189.25s]  Because there's definitely a list of neighborhoods that go underneath that.
[15189.25s -> 15200.26s]  It's 113.
[15200.26s -> 15210.18s]  Is my antenna bent?
[15210.18s -> 15211.06s]  Or is it just like that?
[15212.34s -> 15225.46s]  Here are the rest.
[15227.78s -> 15228.34s]  All right.
[15228.34s -> 15228.82s]  Pocket.
[15234.35s -> 15235.31s]  Well, now it's bent.
[15235.31s -> 15235.71s]  All right.
[15235.71s -> 15236.75s]  113.
[15236.75s -> 15238.91s]  Break or steal the pear decoration.
[15239.55s -> 15248.50s]  What else you got over here?
[15250.38s -> 15250.94s]  Headphones.
[15250.94s -> 15251.74s]  Those are expensive.
[15252.38s -> 15255.44s]  Anybody home?
[15256.00s -> 15264.14s]  No, nobody home.
[15265.36s -> 15266.00s]  See you later.
[15269.74s -> 15270.30s]  There it is.
[15271.49s -> 15272.53s]  Okay, hold on.
[15273.25s -> 15275.68s]  Nobody's going to be here for a long time.
[15275.68s -> 15276.32s]  Take everything.
[15277.36s -> 15279.41s]  My inventory is already full.
[15279.97s -> 15282.54s]  Are you kidding me?
[15284.21s -> 15284.93s]  What the hell?
[15284.93s -> 15285.25s]  Really?
[15286.53s -> 15287.25s]  There's no money?
[15289.01s -> 15293.26s]  What do I have that's so heavy?
[15299.28s -> 15300.00s]  Drop stuff?
[15302.37s -> 15303.81s]  It's probably the guitar that's so heavy.
[15304.45s -> 15306.13s]  The car, there's worth a lot of money though.
[15319.74s -> 15320.54s]  $15.
[15320.54s -> 15321.02s]  It's nothing.
[15321.66s -> 15325.38s]  All right, let's move.
[15327.14s -> 15327.95s]  The router.
[15327.95s -> 15328.43s]  I can't.
[15328.43s -> 15329.47s]  So what's so heavy?
[15331.55s -> 15332.27s]  Lockpicks?
[15332.27s -> 15332.91s]  Front door?
[15332.91s -> 15333.15s]  Key?
[15334.11s -> 15336.66s]  Crowbar?
[15337.54s -> 15342.34s]  The guitar, the bass, and the headphones are very heavy.
[15342.90s -> 15345.31s]  The guitar is extremely heavy.
[15348.58s -> 15349.94s]  Leave them without internet.
[15350.90s -> 15362.45s]  Knife set.
[15363.25s -> 15364.77s]  Can't take the microwave too heavy.
[15366.32s -> 15367.04s]  Tea box.
[15368.48s -> 15375.41s]  Oh, nice house.
[15379.20s -> 15380.32s]  No, give me the TV.
[15380.96s -> 15382.00s]  TV's worth way more.
[15382.72s -> 15385.92s]  Oh, it's a small TV.
[15385.92s -> 15386.40s]  Never mind.
[15388.82s -> 15395.02s]  In fact, all right, I'm good.
[15395.02s -> 15395.50s]  Let's get out.
[15398.94s -> 15399.90s]  Spare key for the bed.
[15399.90s -> 15400.86s]  Wait, give me the spare key.
[15407.26s -> 15408.06s]  Hard drives?
[15408.70s -> 15412.67s]  I can't really move around these.
[15413.55s -> 15417.79s]  All right, I gotta get out of here.
[15417.79s -> 15418.27s]  It's time to go.
[15418.99s -> 15420.24s]  Time to leave.
[15421.20s -> 15421.84s]  Where's the painting?
[15426.46s -> 15427.90s]  Okay, go, out.
[15427.90s -> 15429.10s]  They're gonna be home in like two seconds.
[15429.82s -> 15433.58s]  Use the front door.
[15434.30s -> 15443.63s]  I stole that kid's money.
[15444.99s -> 15446.19s]  He didn't need it.
[15446.83s -> 15457.22s]  Is that person gonna see this?
[15457.78s -> 15480.02s]  Just drive to the edge.
[15480.58s -> 15493.07s]  How could he know that anything was up?
[15495.04s -> 15501.42s]  All right, time to level up.
[15501.42s -> 15503.34s]  I need appraisal two.
[15503.34s -> 15505.94s]  Disassemble jewelry with special tools.
[15505.94s -> 15506.34s]  Got it.
[15506.98s -> 15507.78s]  Mini.
[15507.78s -> 15511.30s]  Greenview 107 don't like our protection plan.
[15512.10s -> 15515.14s]  I hope nothing happens to the jewelry in their bedroom.
[15515.78s -> 15518.26s]  Do I just have to keep stealing money from the same people?
[15522.74s -> 15523.46s]  I feel bad.
[15527.31s -> 15528.83s]  Well, here's jewelry tools.
[15529.95s -> 15532.61s]  I'm probably going to need them, right?
[15535.25s -> 15536.05s]  Whatever.
[15536.05s -> 15541.09s]  Well, here's a radio.
[15546.38s -> 15547.34s]  Rent a thug.
[15547.34s -> 15548.62s]  Steal a painting.
[15548.62s -> 15549.82s]  China from 108.
[15550.46s -> 15555.18s]  Okay, sell the other stuff.
[15555.90s -> 15558.74s]  They keep letting you get away with it.
[15560.37s -> 15561.33s]  Yeah, they really do.
[15563.26s -> 15563.90s]  This is different.
[15564.54s -> 15566.14s]  Jewelry workshop.
[15566.86s -> 15567.58s]  No items.
[15568.14s -> 15575.70s]  What do you do if your house keeps getting robbed?
[15576.98s -> 15581.22s]  You gotta make like an elaborate home alone trap.
[15589.06s -> 15589.86s]  Welcome back.
[15591.50s -> 15593.74s]  The jewelry tools allow you to assemble jewelry before...
[15593.74s -> 15594.54s]  Of course.
[15594.54s -> 15595.42s]  Right, what else we got?
[15595.42s -> 15596.14s]  We got the pear.
[15597.70s -> 15598.90s]  Got the guitar.
[15600.02s -> 15600.98s]  Headphones.
[15600.98s -> 15601.78s]  And the painting.
[15607.06s -> 15609.70s]  Yeah, at that point I would just put the Mona Lisa in the window
[15609.70s -> 15613.78s]  and then put like fucking tacks all over the ground right before it.
[15614.74s -> 15615.94s]  Or like a trap.
[15616.98s -> 15619.38s]  Just build a gigantic trap door underneath.
[15620.02s -> 15622.32s]  And then pull the lever when the guy gets in.
[15630.14s -> 15630.78s]  Nice painting.
[15630.78s -> 15631.74s]  Yeah, it was 10 bucks.
[15632.46s -> 15634.22s]  All right, steal jewelry from 107.
[15636.02s -> 15637.46s]  When do I get to go to another place?
[15652.18s -> 15653.30s]  107.
[15654.02s -> 15661.26s]  Well, it's conveniently located right here.
[15664.61s -> 15665.89s]  I went down the stairs.
[15668.27s -> 15669.31s]  Straight down the stairs.
[15669.87s -> 15673.73s]  It was very interesting.
[15673.73s -> 15674.21s]  Here we go.
[15674.93s -> 15675.65s]  I didn't do that.
[15676.29s -> 15678.88s]  All right, jewelry in the bedroom.
[15693.10s -> 15693.90s]  There.
[15693.90s -> 15696.34s]  Okay, let's case it up.
[15696.34s -> 15698.43s]  Because I don't know anything about 107.
[15699.65s -> 15700.53s]  Absolute zero.
[15701.09s -> 15704.29s]  But what I do know is that radio is not worth anything.
[15704.93s -> 15709.30s]  The wine, on the other hand, is worth 20 bucks.
[15711.17s -> 15715.01s]  The wine is actually worth five dollars less than the radio.
[15715.01s -> 15718.08s]  So I'm not sure why I did that.
[15720.35s -> 15721.31s]  Steal the gnome.
[15721.95s -> 15732.93s]  Is there a gnome in this yard?
[15733.49s -> 15736.62s]  All right, well, I can open this but I don't...
[15736.62s -> 15737.74s]  Somebody might be right behind it.
[15738.46s -> 15750.72s]  All right, got to be really careful.
[15751.52s -> 15752.88s]  Steal the jewelry in the bedroom.
[15756.99s -> 15757.95s]  Can I hear sound effects?
[15758.67s -> 15769.22s]  Come on.
[15769.30s -> 15773.66s]  Are they in the...
[15774.38s -> 15776.42s]  They're right here.
[15777.54s -> 15778.26s]  Oh, shit.
[15778.26s -> 15779.62s]  Is there more than one person in here now?
[15780.18s -> 15783.79s]  They're turning on the lights.
[15784.43s -> 15787.55s]  I wish I knew where they were.
[15788.35s -> 15793.06s]  Dude, they're just going back and forth turning the lights on and off.
[15793.06s -> 15794.58s]  Like, go somewhere.
[15794.58s -> 15795.14s]  What are you doing?
[15795.94s -> 15806.10s]  They're outside.
[15806.74s -> 15829.38s]  Okay, jewelry.
[15829.38s -> 15830.18s]  Where's the jewelry?
[15830.18s -> 15838.77s]  Is she coming upstairs?
[15838.77s -> 15849.89s]  Get in the fucking thing!
[15857.55s -> 15858.59s]  No, that's towards the cops.
[15858.59s -> 15859.31s]  This way.
[15859.31s -> 15862.48s]  Oh, I'm in trouble.
[15862.48s -> 15863.20s]  I got to get up now.
[15863.20s -> 15868.37s]  Come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[15868.37s -> 15869.33s]  Just run straight for the exit.
[15869.33s -> 15870.13s]  You can make it.
[15871.54s -> 15873.22s]  He's closing the gap, but I'm fine.
[15873.22s -> 15874.82s]  I'm good.
[15877.09s -> 15879.89s]  I was trying to hide in the closet, but I couldn't fit in it.
[15879.89s -> 15895.44s]  Please remember to break down the jewelry.
[15895.44s -> 15897.12s]  There's a tool for it in the shop.
[15902.37s -> 15902.93s]  Break it down.
[15902.93s -> 15903.41s]  Select it.
[15905.38s -> 15906.42s]  How do you do this?
[15906.42s -> 15908.02s]  Break down the jewelry.
[15908.02s -> 15929.18s]  Okay.
[15934.03s -> 15935.15s]  You broke it.
[15935.15s -> 15936.67s]  I was supposed to break it.
[15936.67s -> 15942.61s]  You're supposed to pull out all the jewels.
[15942.61s -> 15948.22s]  That's it, right?
[15954.37s -> 15955.49s]  Infinity necklace.
[15962.38s -> 15965.01s]  Yeah, it does look like it, doesn't it?
[15965.57s -> 15967.68s]  What am I detaching?
[15968.32s -> 15976.38s]  It's better be worth a thousand dollars.
[15976.38s -> 15982.77s]  You know, that's just kind of there.
[15983.41s -> 16002.02s]  The best I can do is 25 dollars.
[16003.65s -> 16004.45s]  Take it or leave it.
[16005.17s -> 16016.32s]  The best I can do is 25 dollars.
[16016.32s -> 16017.12s]  That was a good one.
[16017.76s -> 16018.80s]  That was a very good one.
[16018.80s -> 16021.68s]  A professional knows how to handle a real safe.
[16022.32s -> 16024.56s]  Are you lockpicking skills up to the job?
[16025.92s -> 16026.32s]  I don't know.
[16026.32s -> 16029.36s]  Do I have to go break into 106 for a 15th time?
[16030.24s -> 16033.71s]  And cause them all kinds of problems and anguish?
[16034.43s -> 16038.34s]  Do I have anything in here?
[16038.42s -> 16038.74s]  No.
[16038.74s -> 16039.70s]  I have the jewelry though.
[16039.70s -> 16040.26s]  What's it worth?
[16040.90s -> 16046.18s]  Bracelet parts.
[16047.47s -> 16048.67s]  Well, we're gonna go find out.
[16049.39s -> 16051.39s]  Unless, can I sell them on the black market or something?
[16057.87s -> 16058.59s]  Electronics?
[16058.59s -> 16058.99s]  Nope.
[16058.99s -> 16059.55s]  Kitchen?
[16059.55s -> 16059.87s]  Other?
[16060.91s -> 16061.55s]  Antiques?
[16062.35s -> 16062.91s]  Art?
[16062.91s -> 16063.15s]  No.
[16063.87s -> 16065.97s]  Looks like it's getting pawned.
[16070.18s -> 16072.34s]  Steal 15 dollars from 106 again.
[16081.60s -> 16082.48s]  I got some stuff for you.
[16082.48s -> 16083.20s]  Welcome back.
[16084.35s -> 16085.95s]  Well, that's 800 bucks.
[16086.83s -> 16088.43s]  That's a lot more than I thought it was gonna be.
[16099.36s -> 16101.44s]  So, I mean, now...
[16103.50s -> 16105.02s]  107, 108.
[16105.98s -> 16108.54s]  Steal the painting called China.
[16108.54s -> 16111.94s]  I'm gonna have to do it during this point.
[16112.50s -> 16114.77s]  Let's go do it.
[16118.91s -> 16119.95s]  Drop off the hard drive?
[16120.75s -> 16133.36s]  Where do I do that?
[16133.36s -> 16133.76s]  Right here.
[16135.34s -> 16135.90s]  All right, let's...
[16136.78s -> 16140.21s]  I'm not gonna break it.
[16140.85s -> 16143.65s]  All right, we got jewelry tools.
[16143.65s -> 16145.01s]  I don't need that until I'm here.
[16147.41s -> 16149.41s]  Front door key for 109.
[16149.41s -> 16150.21s]  Don't need that.
[16150.21s -> 16151.89s]  Front door key for 113.
[16152.61s -> 16153.49s]  Put that away.
[16155.84s -> 16156.32s]  All right.
[16156.48s -> 16160.35s]  That's a bunch of people.
[16160.35s -> 16161.23s]  I'm like a janitor.
[16161.23s -> 16162.19s]  I have everybody's keys.
[16165.94s -> 16166.42s]  Whatever.
[16186.99s -> 16187.95s]  Okay, let's go.
[16188.83s -> 16190.93s]  Steal China from...
[16191.57s -> 16192.74s]  Where was it?
[16192.74s -> 16195.81s]  101, 108.
[16196.90s -> 16198.42s]  Steal China from 108.
[16199.30s -> 16202.03s]  I will do my best.
[16202.75s -> 16210.45s]  Is he gonna do it again?
[16211.33s -> 16213.33s]  I think he's gonna do it again.
[16215.01s -> 16216.13s]  He's gonna try to do it.
[16216.13s -> 16217.17s]  Let's see if he can do it.
[16228.35s -> 16229.15s]  Well, I got it.
[16235.39s -> 16236.11s]  I can't leave.
[16237.07s -> 16237.87s]  Uh-oh.
[16237.87s -> 16247.09s]  All right, we're good.
[16247.09s -> 16248.21s]  No, no, we're not.
[16248.21s -> 16248.69s]  Not at all.
[16249.25s -> 16259.14s]  Oh, forward I dance!
[16259.14s -> 16269.47s]  All right, I think I'm stuck here.
[16269.47s -> 16282.91s]  Put him behind bars.
[16282.91s -> 16295.34s]  Hey, come here for a second
[16295.34s -> 16300.93s]  so I can restart the checkpoint by hitting you.
[16300.93s -> 16301.49s]  Be nice.
[16301.49s -> 16322.78s]  I should be able to get in the car.
[16322.78s -> 16324.30s]  You're a caged animal.
[16324.30s -> 16333.62s]  I don't have any V-Bucks.
[16333.62s -> 16337.71s]  How much is one V-Dollar worth in...
[16337.71s -> 16400.77s]  I have to hold sprint down so I don't hit.
[16400.77s -> 16401.49s]  Just reverse.
[16401.49s -> 16401.97s]  I can't.
[16402.61s -> 16405.01s]  I tried to get the wheels in the inside of the...
[16405.57s -> 16406.21s]  Where the stairs are.
[16406.21s -> 16406.77s]  I couldn't do it.
[16407.41s -> 16418.19s]  Come on.
[16423.82s -> 16424.38s]  Oh, no.
[16426.35s -> 16432.00s]  I think I may have ruined the whole game.
[16432.00s -> 16433.04s]  I think I saw...
[16433.04s -> 16436.48s]  Why would auto save right there?
[16436.48s -> 16446.08s]  Is that the end?
[16446.64s -> 16448.08s]  Is this where I have to end this game?
[16448.64s -> 16450.61s]  What if I just don't move?
[16450.61s -> 16457.55s]  Oh, I think I can do it.
[16457.55s -> 16458.99s]  I just need to get the reverse right.
[16465.23s -> 16466.43s]  Okay, if I can just...
[16468.80s -> 16470.64s]  When I press S, it goes forward.
[16474.02s -> 16475.62s]  I'm trying to reverse right now.
[16475.62s -> 16481.54s]  Come on, right here.
[16481.54s -> 16482.34s]  Can I get it right here?
[16482.98s -> 16487.10s]  Ooh, almost had it.
[16487.66s -> 16488.91s]  Almost got it.
[16489.47s -> 16501.09s]  Come on!
[16501.57s -> 16509.39s]  I think I can go over this if I really try hard enough here.
[16512.70s -> 16513.18s]  I think so.
[16518.54s -> 16520.06s]  Ask the guy across the street.
[16520.06s -> 16521.10s]  I soft-locked the whole game.
[16521.10s -> 16521.90s]  It's over.
[16521.90s -> 16526.45s]  Was it worth it, Jeremy?
[16542.61s -> 16543.25s]  I can't just...
[16543.25s -> 16544.05s]  Can I just back up?
[16544.05s -> 16545.49s]  I can't back up any more than this.
[16547.73s -> 16548.05s]  Save it!
[16548.05s -> 16549.26s]  Come on, get up!
[16549.26s -> 16550.06s]  Go, go, go, go!
[16550.06s -> 16551.26s]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
[16551.26s -> 16551.66s]  I did it.
[16551.66s -> 16552.70s]  Okay, I made it.
[16552.70s -> 16585.42s]  I did it!
[16585.42s -> 16586.78s]  Not soft-locked anymore.
[16586.78s -> 16593.81s]  Wait, what's the plan here?
[16598.78s -> 16599.74s]  Somebody just wrote,
[16599.74s -> 16600.78s]  fucking loser.
[16601.94s -> 16602.34s]  I...
[16602.34s -> 16603.86s]  Hey, come on, man.
[16603.86s -> 16609.74s]  Don't be so mean to me.
[16609.74s -> 16610.62s]  Fucking loser.
[16614.00s -> 16614.88s]  All right, 108.
[16615.52s -> 16616.72s]  Steal the china.
[16617.60s -> 16618.96s]  Steal the china.
[16618.96s -> 16620.26s]  Steal the china.
[16620.26s -> 16621.28s]  Steal the china.
[16621.28s -> 16622.56s]  If I say it enough times I'll get it.
[16623.94s -> 16625.38s]  Steal the china.
[16625.38s -> 16626.50s]  Steal the china.
[16628.11s -> 16629.49s]  Say it again.
[16629.49s -> 16630.69s]  Steal the china.
[16642.88s -> 16644.08s]  Steal the china.
[16644.08s -> 16646.88s]  Steal the china.
[16658.11s -> 16658.19s]  No.
[16658.19s -> 16659.31s]  Why am I trying to get in the car?
[16659.31s -> 16660.03s]  No, just run.
[16660.03s -> 16676.30s]  I did it! I did it in one shot! What? I didn't get the china!
[16677.34s -> 16685.02s]  Steal the china! Steal the china! Steal the china! Not the daisy! Not the daisy!
[16686.74s -> 16697.15s]  The china! Oh my god! That was not the right painting, but it was lit up! Where is it?
[16697.63s -> 16726.10s]  There's people! No! No! Steal the china! Steal the china! Steal the china! Steal the china!
[16731.12s -> 16758.53s]  No, that's not it! We're gonna go back to the... Ow, my stomach! We're going back to the car.
[16762.75s -> 16770.94s]  Yeah, officers! The fuck! Officer, this guy ran into my house. He just kept screaming,
[16770.94s -> 16784.05s]  Steal the china! Steal the china! Oh god damn it! The guy sprints in your house,
[16784.77s -> 16790.80s]  just repeating the same like robotic sentence. You have a painting upstairs,
[16790.80s -> 16795.28s]  you're like, I have a painting called the china? Oh, I do! That's right!
[16800.64s -> 16813.22s]  Oh, no! Get in the car! How did I do this last time?
[16813.46s -> 16824.82s]  Steal the china. Just saying it so deliberately. You have to remind yourself, it's a fucking grocery
[16824.82s -> 16834.43s]  list. Pick up eggs. Pick up the eggs. Wife will be very angry with me. Pick up the eggs. I can't
[16834.43s -> 16876.75s]  believe I'm back here again. I can't fucking steal the china. I said it over and over and
[16876.75s -> 16883.01s]  over again, and I picked up the wrong one, and now we're back here. It's like we never
[16886.38s -> 16903.54s]  left here. How am I here again? Because I stole the wrong painting, and
[16909.10s -> 16919.23s]  should have just left the map. I know. What is this? Why are you looking? Say it again.
[16919.87s -> 16940.13s]  Steal the china. Uh oh. Steal the china. It's not me talking. Steal the china. My frame!
[16941.89s -> 16951.60s]  Oh, no! My computer's gonna crack! I'm gonna blue screen! I'm going! No! Why?
[16953.02s -> 16966.32s]  Get me out! I'm like it's a memory leak. I'm in a memory leak. I can't escape. I didn't get
[16966.32s -> 16975.89s]  the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Not the... Say it again. Steal
[16975.89s -> 16994.54s]  the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china.
[16995.50s -> 17000.06s]  I'm like trying to bring somebody back to life. I'm like sitting around a circle with like
[17000.06s -> 17015.30s]  candles around me. Trying to bring like Elvis back. I can't alt tab. 93%. Look at how slow...
[17015.30s -> 17028.45s]  I gotta pull this out of here before my computer breaks. Alt F4. I have to. Maybe it'll help.
[17032.54s -> 17056.37s]  My computer is hard locking. Am I still alive? Yep. Okay, I'm good. I just...
[17057.33s -> 17067.79s]  I have to steal the china. I have to steal the china. I can... I'll never let this down.
[17067.79s -> 17071.15s]  I have to get this. I have to go steal it. I have to go get this dumb fucking painting.
[17071.87s -> 17108.42s]  Can we get... Can we get china in the next German rumble? No. I don't... What? How would
[17108.42s -> 17116.78s]  that work? Like the whole... Like all... Like all the whole... The whole china? The whole thing?
[17130.82s -> 17167.87s]  Sprint. Sprint. Okay, I'm almost there. How do I save the game? Did it. Okay, it's time.
[17168.43s -> 17178.90s]  It's time. Give me... Let's give me one second. Just give me one minute here.
[17178.90s -> 17185.41s]  I'm going to just use the bathroom. I'll be right back. Get yourself a little snack.
[17185.41s -> 17345.07s]  I'll see you in two seconds. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china.
[17345.15s -> 17346.59s]  Oh shit, I fucked it up.
[17350.58s -> 17351.22s]  God damn it.
[17361.06s -> 17367.23s]  I was gonna have this blast while I was doing it with like scary music. Oh well. Well, that's
[17367.23s -> 17388.62s]  ruined. But I didn't go anywhere, by the way. I've been here the whole time. You can still do
[17388.62s -> 17400.54s]  it. I won't tell anyone. I was gonna... I need like more time. I was gonna start screaming on
[17400.54s -> 17410.77s]  it and stuff. All right. Where... I don't even know where we're going. 107, right?
[17430.75s -> 17434.11s]  I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
[17442.80s -> 17454.67s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. Don't you dare joke around with us.
[17458.58s -> 17465.06s]  Just hurry up and steal the china, okay? That's all that matters. Do as fast as you possibly can.
[17485.44s -> 17516.08s]  Okay, where is it? I don't even care. It's up there. Steal. That was the right one.
[17516.08s -> 17520.48s]  That was the right painting. Do you understand? That... This is the... This is the china.
[17520.48s -> 17525.36s]  That's the china. That's it. That's the china. I was right the first time. I had china.
[17525.36s -> 17531.28s]  I picked up china. That was china. I stole it. I stole china.
[17543.79s -> 17546.03s]  That was what it was pointing at. I had it the whole time.
[17548.48s -> 17558.24s]  That's daisy. But why is it... What happened? It was clearly... That was where it was.
[17558.24s -> 17600.37s]  Where'd it go? All right. So it explains to me, right? The marker was upstairs
[17600.37s -> 17604.85s]  around that corner. The daisy is the thing that's highlighted. The thing behind it is
[17604.85s -> 17617.42s]  the flower. Where's the china? Where is the china? Bottom floor? Why is it pointing me upstairs?
[17618.14s -> 17627.41s]  Like, this is... This is... This is not down here. It's very clearly like,
[17627.41s -> 17659.44s]  go up there and steal china. There it is. That's it. Is that it? Is it? Is there it is?
[17660.16s -> 17703.97s]  The china. How do you get out of your fucked up house? Get out of here. I need the light. Oh!
[17703.97s -> 17729.62s]  Get in there. The garage door? I... There's no garage door opener here. Yes, there is.
[17729.62s -> 17806.90s]  He got it. He caught the china. Yeah! Yes! D plus. Level up. Block picking four.
[17806.90s -> 17823.73s]  Block picking four. Open safe. Use glass knife. I only need two skill points. What? Who else?
[17823.73s -> 17832.06s]  What can I do now? All right. Where's the china on here? Candle holder, candle holder,
[17832.06s -> 17857.84s]  triple vase, flower vase, glass cup, the china. Where is it? I mean, I have it.
[17857.84s -> 17889.10s]  Do I need to steal it? I've got the china right here. This is correct, right? Welcome back.
[17890.22s -> 17937.94s]  Here. Four hundred bucks. Thank you. I had it right the whole time. Everybody was screaming at
[17937.94s -> 17958.67s]  me. I was being screamed at. That it was the daisy. No, no. It was a joke and I'm glad it...
[17958.67s -> 17967.41s]  Say we're fine. That's pretty... It's perfectly fine. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal
[17967.41s -> 18066.98s]  the china. Steal the china. Get it. Okay. Got it. Stole the daisy. No, it was the china.
[18066.98s -> 18084.67s]  That was the china. I knew I wasn't crazy. I knew that I wasn't crazy, you know? New hints.
[18086.45s -> 18088.93s]  Uh, I can't do the skills. I want to... I need to wait till the next level.
[18090.50s -> 18100.58s]  I got new notes. Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs,
[18101.54s -> 18107.57s]  jobs, jobs. I don't have any jobs. There's no jobs. I don't have any jobs.
[18123.92s -> 18133.34s]  Where are the jobs? Spencer just came in and gave five community subs here. Spencer Twitch
[18133.34s -> 18140.14s]  chat. Did I say Twitch chat? Twitch chat? I have no idea what the fuck's wrong with me,
[18140.14s -> 18147.90s]  but thank you, Spencer. And thanks for... See, there aren't... Look it. This is a bunch of
[18147.90s -> 18158.78s]  neighborhoods you can go to. But thanks a lot, man. I got nothing else to do. Do I just have
[18158.78s -> 18167.06s]  to go break into people's houses and steal stuff? Just get to level four? Man, I guess.
[18177.70s -> 18180.82s]  Steal for the pleasure of it. Well, I need... Okay, now I'm going to go to one of the
[18180.82s -> 18187.94s]  bigger houses now. Steal the china to farm XP. I'm not going to steal china to farm XP.
[18189.58s -> 18199.02s]  That would be a bad, bad idea. Because China does not have very much profit. It's only worth
[18199.02s -> 18208.45s]  like $15 or something. Or what was it? $40? I'd be better off stealing money from people's
[18208.45s -> 18217.47s]  houses. Like these people. It was $400. Well, is it? Should I just go do that again?
[18217.47s -> 18227.98s]  Okay, it was $400. Why did I think it was like $40? Maybe it's because of all the other little
[18227.98s -> 18265.89s]  ones. I'm sorry, guys. This is another slide. Nice. I'm gonna do it again. This is costing
[18265.89s -> 18282.86s]  me too much money. Last one, I promise. Last one. I want to like feel the thing go down.
[18283.58s -> 18286.61s]  You know, I want to I want to feel it like underneath my carriage here.
[18288.91s -> 18308.05s]  In first person. It's better to ride a roller coaster like this. Oh god, we're at the top
[18308.05s -> 18336.67s]  of Splash Mountain. Come on, back into this. Am I gonna get the car towed?
[18338.43s -> 18342.59s]  The car is gonna get towed with me in it. How does that work?
[18343.23s -> 18346.88s]  Hold on, I need to know how this works. He's calling the cops right now.
[18347.44s -> 18363.41s]  The police will tow your car. Okay, let's wait for the tow truck. He's waiting his turn on
[18363.41s -> 18367.65s]  the slide. Yeah. Well, I was too fat. I was a big fat guy and got stuck on it.
[18368.37s -> 18374.80s]  Yeah, I can't open the door. I'm kind of stuck on this right now. But here it comes. Yeah,
[18374.80s -> 18387.25s]  here comes the police to help me. Here it comes. How the hell are you gonna figure
[18387.25s -> 18393.74s]  out how to get here? He's gonna have a lot of trouble trying to get over here.
[18401.94s -> 18409.17s]  No, he's gonna he's gonna come back because he's gonna come over here and he's gonna
[18409.17s -> 18418.59s]  he's gonna screw the whole thing up. Well, I'm blocking both sides. So you can't walk up
[18418.59s -> 18424.03s]  here and oh, if I could only just go down right now. If I could only just drive straight down.
[18432.88s -> 18438.02s]  All the NPCs are coming over here. I don't know why they're so drawn to this place.
[18438.02s -> 18443.39s]  I'm like a NPC magnet. What are you doing? No, why is it? It really is a line for the slide.
[18445.09s -> 18470.77s]  He can't figure it out. He has no idea where to go. Can I how do you beep? Q? No.
[18471.49s -> 18485.55s]  Q opens up this wheel. There was another person. The police will tow your car. The
[18485.55s -> 18502.85s]  cop is gone. All great thieves honk their horn. I kind of want to see if every NPC in the whole
[18502.85s -> 18509.02s]  town comes over here. Look at this. Did you bind M3 to eat yet? I don't know what the hell
[18509.02s -> 18521.12s]  I was talking about. What was I even talking about? Just come over here. Please, police officer,
[18521.12s -> 18529.30s]  just drive over here. I'm very clearly causing a problem. Just drive down here.
[18530.51s -> 18542.46s]  You know where I am. Turn in here. Come on. Turn in here. Turn in here. Turn! Turn! Oh,
[18542.46s -> 18550.83s]  he's gonna drive by us every time. The star is just fading. Come on, there's gotta be something
[18550.83s -> 18560.85s]  I can do about this here. I can't go forward. I can't go backwards. I can't. Nobody can do
[18560.85s -> 18575.09s]  anything. I'm just gonna try to hold it. What about this way? There's another person.
[18580.21s -> 18590.22s]  Damn it. I can't at least climb out of the side. Well, hold on. Last chance. Come on. Turn
[18590.22s -> 18596.98s]  down here. You can see me. I'm right here. I'm waving. I'll wave to you. No, he can't
[18596.98s -> 18607.41s]  do it. He's not gonna do it. He'll never figure it out. I wonder if I can do like a
[18607.41s -> 18628.91s]  series of... Oh, well. We tried. Stop stalling. What do you want me to do? I'm trying to go.
[18632.16s -> 18639.68s]  Making noise? Hold on. I'm gonna get the actual police over here. I was just making
[18639.68s -> 18647.76s]  noise apparently. Making noise. Because if they get the actual police over here,
[18647.76s -> 18658.82s]  this could get interesting. I need to... Come on. Just get the cops over here. Like
[18658.82s -> 18668.45s]  the actual... Like two stars. This could get interesting. I'm gonna give this like 10 more
[18668.45s -> 18683.33s]  seconds and then I'll stop. I wish there was a horn. I'm pressing every button to try to beep.
[18683.89s -> 18698.54s]  I just don't think it exists. Alt shift. I can't hit the brakes. Oh, well. That's too bad.
[18699.81s -> 18711.84s]  Too bad. Nah, I can't get up. I was trying to do the... Look at how funny this is to go
[18711.84s -> 18731.25s]  down the slide. All right. What do I go? Just... I was gonna steal stuff. Do it again.
[18735.98s -> 18751.94s]  I didn't sell my paintings, you're right. Your bag is full. Welcome back. Sell them all.
[18754.00s -> 18763.82s]  All right. Let's go. Sell the china. Sell the china. Sell the china. Sell the china.
[18764.54s -> 18780.72s]  I'm gonna be hearing that in my sleep tonight. Buy the china back?
[18781.68s -> 18787.89s]  Why would I want to buy the china back? I got $400 for it. All right. Let's make this easy.
[18787.89s -> 18805.39s]  I'm gonna go to... I want to go to the bigger houses over here. I didn't... Oh, I stuck again.
[18805.39s -> 18815.87s]  I was just trying to go the other way. I can't move. I'm stuck again. At least I can get out
[18815.87s -> 18830.21s]  of that goddamn car. How would I get stuck there? That's impossible. All right. I'm just
[18830.21s -> 18834.21s]  gonna steal from... I have the thing to open the doors here. I'm gonna get a bunch of money
[18835.25s -> 18845.54s]  from 113 because I know that they're both not home. Well, they're both not be home,
[18845.54s -> 18858.32s]  which is Barbara now. And we steal literally all their stuff. Does this explode?
[18869.01s -> 18876.32s]  Okay. They're both gone at this point. Yes, they are. Okay. Just give me your stuff. I'm
[18876.32s -> 18891.68s]  looking for expensive stuff. These are two bucks a pop. Too heavy. Get the double alarm
[18891.68s -> 18905.54s]  clock. I don't want it. I don't want the dumb alarm clock. I'll take cash. Cash is easy.
[18905.54s -> 18916.21s]  50 bucks. There it is. Clown ball. Don't want it. Okay. Expensive guitar. $70 days.
[18916.85s -> 18927.46s]  Nothing there. I don't want the alarm clock. Check for more money. No, these things are
[18927.46s -> 18937.33s]  both $12. Don't want them. I can't pick up the clown ball. So why would I be able to steal it?
[18937.33s -> 18964.38s]  Look, I can't take the clown ball. Oops. I leave another 50 bucks. $5. Worthless. Ooh,
[18965.10s -> 18971.90s]  $50 phone. Pretty nice. I don't these cabinets open. $90 for a microwave,
[18971.90s -> 18979.97s]  but I can't carry it. It's too heavy. Tea box. Couple of wines. I think I'm out of room.
[18979.97s -> 18994.51s]  Let's like find some. Wait, how much is this worth? $40? Worthless. $18? Even more worthless.
[18995.07s -> 19000.69s]  This receiver is, I can't even pick it up. Who's looking? Does somebody see me?
[19000.69s -> 19024.54s]  This thing's $40. Just take it. Let's go the way we came. Baptism. No, this one's more
[19024.54s -> 19047.81s]  expensive. Okay, I can go with the front door. All right. Let's just, can I just run with the
[19047.81s -> 19065.60s]  painting in my hands? Just to the end? Will I still have it? Walk it right to the pawn shop.
[19065.60s -> 19077.30s]  Let's see if this works. It says a nice, no, I don't have it. Trunk? No. Oh well. All right.
[19077.30s -> 19087.17s]  Welcome back. So, guitar, lemon, razor, tea box, wine, wine. All right. I can do
[19087.81s -> 19099.87s]  lockpicking four now, right? No, not yet. Damn. Carry big items faster. More backpack
[19099.87s -> 19107.15s]  space. Disamble jewelry. Remove security from decks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Climb on the house
[19107.15s -> 19127.55s]  gutters. Well, I'll give it a shot. Everything gives the same XP, so just steal a ton of small
[19127.55s -> 19143.78s]  stuff. Thanks for the tip. That's a good idea. All right. 101 is a big house. It's time to go
[19143.78s -> 19163.82s]  for the big shit. 101 is gigantic. Plenty of points of entry. What's with the indicator here?
[19167.66s -> 19174.42s]  Camera in front? Okay. Camera in front. Power switch will turn off the cameras.
[19175.52s -> 19192.40s]  Well, here's the electrical. Open it up. The electricity will be fixed in 237. Does the
[19192.40s -> 19211.81s]  guy actually come fix it? What's that way? Now, there's people walking around out here.
[19212.53s -> 19229.63s]  Is there no one for me to jump the fence? I'm going to go for it when this guy passes here.
[19230.27s -> 19278.37s]  Ready? One, two, three. Did you see me? I probably have expensive shit in here.
[19278.37s -> 19282.43s]  Come on, give me some intel. I can't get intel. I'm looking right at you.
[19283.07s -> 19343.26s]  What? Okay. The only two people that live here already got a guitar. Shit. Really? You'll never
[19343.26s -> 19370.72s]  get me on the roof. You'll never get me. Let's see. They're going to get out. Are you kidding
[19370.72s -> 19391.04s]  me? Come on. Damn it. Stop right there. All right. We're going to go. We're going to go
[19391.04s -> 19400.91s]  with a, we're going to go with a new tactic. It's called find a brick because I have not
[19400.91s -> 19405.63s]  seen one in this almost five and a half hours that this game has been played. Has
[19405.63s -> 19433.46s]  anybody seen a brick? Even one? Where the hell are they? On the sidewalks? You see
[19433.46s -> 19443.31s]  one right in front of the computer screen, do you? On the ground. Yeah, I know they're
[19443.31s -> 19462.42s]  on the ground, but whereabouts on the ground? Down alleys? There's one at the bus stop.
[19463.06s -> 19478.43s]  Well, there's not one at the bus stop, but over here. This kind of park bench area.
[19480.98s -> 19486.90s]  Some houses are made out of them. You know, you're right. They are. They are made out of
[19486.90s -> 19502.90s]  bricks. The first brick I find, we have to get some great shots. Sidewalks near houses.
[19506.38s -> 19555.60s]  Brick. Was it worth it? No, but that doesn't mean I can't get it through a window and
[19555.60s -> 19564.37s]  brick. I used to see in red bricks, not the cement looking cinder block bricks,
[19566.10s -> 19569.86s]  but I'm going to try and get it in windows. We'll play basketball from now on.
[19570.50s -> 19581.52s]  Now I'm going to go through that. I'm just going to throw bricks through windows. That's
[19581.52s -> 19593.04s]  pretty much the rest of the stream. I hope you guys are ready to play. I got to get some
[19593.04s -> 19605.33s]  good challenges here, but I can only get one brick. Try throwing it at a cop.
[19605.97s -> 19616.88s]  Laughing my ass off, poser. He's not going to get it through the window. Yes, I will.
[19617.52s -> 19638.93s]  If I could find one. I wish I had a brick right now. I wish I had a brick right now.
[19641.01s -> 19687.63s]  Oh shit. I need this. Hey, oh, I can't get out. I can't get out of here. Why would you do that?
[19687.63s -> 19714.10s]  Oh, thank you. What? I didn't get a chance. Why would you close the crazed psycho in the
[19714.10s -> 19728.13s]  garage with you? That's the last thing you'd want to do. Oh my God. This guy's going to
[19728.13s -> 19732.21s]  this guy's throwing bricks at me and he's running in here sprinting at me. It's scary.
[19732.85s -> 19736.77s]  Hey man, like you okay? What's up man? You like okay being locked in here with me?
[19737.41s -> 19759.15s]  Damn it. Let's sit right here. Let's see what that is. Way too low. Oh, that was close.
[19767.41s -> 19812.22s]  I just want them back. A new house. I have to get that. What? Throw a brick at the police.
[19812.94s -> 19817.98s]  I have to get a brick aimed in the right direction in the first place and not have one
[19817.98s -> 19828.91s]  spawn on top of me. You just had to throw them at the house with a security camera.
[19829.87s -> 19851.62s]  Bastard. I'll show this asshole. You're gonna throw bricks at my neighbor. Okay, this is
[19851.62s -> 19862.59s]  actually easier to find bricks to go faster like this. All right, we've got four bricks
[19862.59s -> 19870.00s]  here. You thought you could stop me? You think your security cameras are gonna stop me?
[19870.64s -> 19920.62s]  Next time come to the PTA meeting motherfucker. Oh, it was so close. Just restart it.
[19920.70s -> 19927.86s]  I know what that is. Store bricks in your vehicle. Hold on. Can I put bricks in the car and just
[19927.86s -> 19985.20s]  have a never-ending rain bricks on somebody? What the fuck is he doing in the house already?
[19985.20s -> 20004.86s]  Jesus. Oh, is your husband the cop? My guy the call came. He got that inside the house.
[20004.86s -> 20009.66s]  He was getting ready for work. Perfect place to store these. Perfect place. Perfect checkpoint.
[20009.66s -> 20012.64s]  All right, we're gonna go for the we're gonna get a bunch of bricks in here.
[20013.20s -> 20032.22s]  Oops. I don't think you can do this.
[20038.48s -> 20045.20s]  I hate this car. Car's giving me nothing but trouble.
[20050.69s -> 20076.85s]  So bad. No, what are you doing? I didn't even cross the line. So, okay, you can't,
[20077.57s -> 20082.58s]  so you can't put the bricks in the cars. I have to break a window with a brick before
[20082.58s -> 20092.56s]  I turn the stream off. I'm sorry, I have to. I mean, I'm pretty much got my fill of the
[20092.56s -> 20098.48s]  game. This game's pretty fun. If there's more content here, that'd be, it'd be better.
[20098.48s -> 20104.82s]  There's more like neighborhoods. I'm sure there probably is, but I mean, I need to end this
[20104.82s -> 20124.53s]  with a brick throw through a window. This is gonna keep needing to happen. What was that
[20124.53s -> 20145.74s]  spot? It was back in front of the 101, right? Right here. Bricks. Aren't they like
[20145.74s -> 20153.70s]  right here? I can't, you can't steal cars in this game. They're usually like right here.
[20154.50s -> 20177.18s]  Where do my bricks go? Oh, they're right there. Okay. All right. I have to get this.
[20178.22s -> 20193.47s]  That window right there. The same guy every day comes and tries to throw a
[20193.47s -> 20201.34s]  fucking brick through your window. Yes! I did it!
[20221.49s -> 20221.97s]  Underneath.
[20224.70s -> 20235.09s]  What time is it? Let me just have a couple sips of coffee here.
[20237.18s -> 20242.58s]  That's a nice, bold, rich flavor. Honey, what are you doing? Are you going to work? Okay.
[20245.28s -> 20250.83s]  Goodbye, kids. I'll see you later. Okay, have a great day. All right, now I'll do what I do
[20250.83s -> 20262.58s]  every day. Let's sound good in the newspaper there. Mr. Jordan, nice to see you. Line it up
[20262.58s -> 20276.02s]  here. Right there. A little too high. A little too much. I'm gonna go over the bathroom window
[20276.02s -> 20312.00s]  tonight. See if I can maybe hit one of them. Got one. Have a nice day. See you tomorrow. Same
[20312.00s -> 20337.12s]  time. How much does he get paid? Nothing. He won the scratch off lottery 25 years ago.
[20337.84s -> 20358.26s]  Dude, hit the mega millions. We've got nothing else to do. This time, let's go for somebody's
[20358.26s -> 20375.60s]  head. Oh, we got an open door. Open, open, open, open. Throwing bricks into the house
[20375.60s -> 20399.97s]  at this point. Anybody up there? Oh my god! It would have been right in his head.
[20406.24s -> 20439.47s]  Me! Hold on. Hold on. Stay there. Come here. I need to ask you a very important question.
[20439.63s -> 20466.05s]  You have to stand right in front of me. Right here. Don't move. That was too far to the left.
[20492.21s -> 20497.10s]  I have to do it. I ran out of stuff to do in the game, but for some reason,
[20497.10s -> 20508.35s]  I'm not leaving the game. I'm still here. I haven't left yet. I'm done. They ran that
[20508.35s -> 20517.06s]  lady over. That's fine. I have to get it. It's gonna happen. You'll see it. We can all go,
[20517.14s -> 20541.55s]  what the heck? Oh my god, he did it! Perfect. Oh my god. Oh my god. Fucking Jesus Christ.
[20548.59s -> 20554.06s]  Right there. Stop. Stop. Why are you getting so close? Some of them keep moving.
[20559.09s -> 20595.22s]  I think that my computer lagged, but yeah. Do they have a hurtbox? Yeah, they do. Oh,
[20595.22s -> 20612.51s]  fuck me. All right, the last attempt. I'm gonna try this one more time. I can't go
[20612.51s -> 20622.45s]  to sleep until you do this. I can't go to sleep until I do this. That looks good. No!
[20634.83s -> 20687.46s]  Oh my god. I can't believe it. I got a better idea. Block him with the car? That's not a
[20687.46s -> 20694.24s]  bad idea. Which way are you gonna go? I think I can get this though. You just go right there
[20694.24s -> 20712.38s]  like that. It should be it right here. Did it land? All right, I'm gonna block him with the
[20712.38s -> 20731.89s]  car. Did anybody hear it? No landing sound means hit. All right, well, we're gonna have
[20732.45s -> 20737.52s]  to block this. I'm sorry, guys. Like if you thought you were gonna see something here.
[20738.32s -> 20747.70s]  Stream's been over for 10-20 minutes. I'm just like kind of winding down. This is like just
[20747.70s -> 20762.08s]  like a me time right now. You know what I mean? It's just a little me time. All right,
[20762.08s -> 20776.16s]  where are they? We'll put that away. Why am I losing my place right now? I'm losing my
[20776.16s -> 20790.80s]  place. Right here. All right, stay there. Stay there. Don't move. It's like right here.
[20810.11s -> 20815.86s]  Oh my god. Why? That's as close as you could possibly be without a heading.
[20858.86s -> 20862.70s]  That wasn't even funny. It was only funny because his facial expression didn't change
[20862.70s -> 20878.99s]  at all. Uh, what am I doing still? Why am I still here? I haven't, I can't leave.
[20879.55s -> 20919.54s]  I don't think I can leave. Oh, all right. I got, I'm out of here. I'm done. Hey,
[20919.54s -> 20931.58s]  thanks for coming to the stream, everybody. That was fun. Can you crush, no, you, you,
[20931.58s -> 20940.34s]  you can, you, look, you can like hurt people. It's not the way you think. People, uh, there's
[20940.34s -> 20949.42s]  no, nobody dies. Nobody gets hurt. The admission ends. But that was fun. Thanks everybody for
[20949.42s -> 20956.98s]  sticking around. By the way, if you didn't know, uh, there's a poll that is hanging
[20956.98s -> 20963.04s]  around here. I talked about it in the first, uh, probably five minutes of the stream, but
[20963.04s -> 20970.48s]  this, if you could please vote on this poll, pick your favorite one for the green screen.
[20970.48s -> 20974.88s]  One of these actions, you got to pick one for your favorite because there was a lot of meme
[20975.52s -> 20983.50s]  shit. There was a lot of meme responses and of the hundred and like 75 different actions,
[20983.50s -> 20993.23s]  uh, the top three here are going to be included as well. So I put the memes in one thing. I
[20993.23s -> 20996.67s]  don't know when it happened. I mean, I know what some of this stuff does. I mean,
[20996.67s -> 21001.95s]  I know what like the Macarena is. I don't know what Jojo poses are. I know what the
[21001.95s -> 21005.39s]  sunglasses is and how the Sonic run is. The John Travolta thing, Dark Souls,
[21006.27s -> 21018.50s]  the bee video. I know what these are, but the date for the green screen has changed to Friday.
[21018.50s -> 21026.88s]  So Friday, I figured more people will be able to hang out. We could just relax. So it's
[21026.88s -> 21029.92s]  not on a week night. Well, Friday is technically a week night, but it's right before the
[21029.92s -> 21033.44s]  weekend. So I figured a lot of you guys would have a little bit easier of a time to
[21033.44s -> 21040.83s]  hang out and go if you wanted to. Uh, what time Friday? That is the real question. It's
[21040.83s -> 21048.56s]  probably going to be around, I would say three or four PM Eastern. That's the thought.
[21049.74s -> 21053.90s]  I don't know the exact time that I'll be in the studio because they're still
[21054.46s -> 21058.54s]  kind of working that out. So I, it's probably going to be in the afternoon,
[21062.50s -> 21068.08s]  but thank you everybody for hanging out. That was, I didn't expect to play six hours of
[21068.08s -> 21072.32s]  Thief Simulator. I was really under the impression that I was going to do that and
[21072.32s -> 21078.00s]  then like go play Hitman or go play like Delta Rune or something. But, uh, Hitman is out.
[21079.04s -> 21089.89s]  I will see you guys tomorrow. So tomorrow, which is Wednesday, we will be playing,
[21091.20s -> 21098.05s]  uh, Hitman 2 or Delta Rune, one of those two. Thief Simulator over Delta Rune. Well,
[21098.05s -> 21101.09s]  I did a vote before the stream started and people wanted to see this game.
[21101.73s -> 21108.80s]  I hope you had fun. Thanks for sticking around. It's getting late. I know for a lot of you guys, so
[21109.52s -> 21116.64s]  take care. Much love to you. Uh, but tomorrow I'll be in the chat hanging out. We'll figure
[21116.64s -> 21122.34s]  out if I'm going to do Hitman or Delta Rune because once I start Hitman, I kind of,
[21122.34s -> 21126.82s]  I'm kind of going to play it for at least three or four streams in a row, I would assume,
[21126.82s -> 21134.08s]  because I loved the first one so much. So maybe, I don't know, maybe we'll do Delta
[21134.08s -> 21139.49s]  Rune tomorrow and then Hitman after the green screen stream or Hitman on Thursday and then,
[21139.49s -> 21142.93s]  but we'll see. I got to figure that out because I don't have a schedule yet really.
[21144.48s -> 21150.48s]  But, uh, we'll see. Vote on that poll. I have tons of suggestions. It's going to be a lot
[21150.48s -> 21156.62s]  of fun. The green screen stream is set to go on Friday and I will see you guys later.
[21156.62s -> 21167.10s]  And for that, let's go back to earlier today and let's go through the bits. Take care,
[21167.10s -> 21174.05s]  everybody. And let's start with the outro, which should have been on already, but it wasn't.
[21175.81s -> 21178.93s]  All right. Thank you, Benny Toe for the two dollars. Hey, Jerma, I know this is a weird
[21178.93s -> 21182.85s]  question, but, uh, when you and italics wake up, does it happen that both of you guys,
[21184.13s -> 21188.24s]  uh, have, uh, brush our teeth? We do. We do brush our teeth every morning,
[21188.24s -> 21191.20s]  Benny. Thanks for the two bucks. Uh, Flubba Gut, thanks for the one dollar
[21191.20s -> 21195.76s]  gun. Interview for an apprenticeship in IT tomorrow at 10 AM. Got to get my Jerma fix
[21195.76s -> 21205.46s]  if I'm going to be confident. Good luck to you, Flubba Gut. Take care. Hope it goes well.
[21205.46s -> 21211.60s]  If you're not here anymore, well, we wish you the best. MostlyLost, thanks for the one dollar.
[21211.60s -> 21215.04s]  To be honest, I only donated to this channel to help italics pay for his house.
[21220.94s -> 21227.09s]  That doesn't make any sense. Thank you MostlyLost for the one dollar, though. Thank you too.
[21227.09s -> 21230.37s]  Bake me home for the two bucks. What games are you looking forward to in 2019?
[21231.54s -> 21241.71s]  Um, I mean, Smash Brothers comes out in 2018. Uh, February or March, what was it, uh,
[21242.91s -> 21245.63s]  the From Software game launches in March or February, right?
[21247.70s -> 21257.30s]  Shadows Die Twice should be awesome. Yeah, yes, you can absolutely expect streams of that game.
[21259.39s -> 21264.98s]  Sekiro, yeah, there it is. Looking forward to that one, but besides that, I'm not really
[21264.98s -> 21270.58s]  too sure. I'd have to take a look at what's coming out. Thank you Devakitty for the one
[21270.58s -> 21274.74s]  dollar. Jojo poses aren't a stupid meme thing. It's just that Jojo poses are awesome and it
[21274.74s -> 21280.26s]  would be fun. Well, that's up to you guys. I'm not going to give an opinion on them,
[21280.82s -> 21289.98s]  but thank you. Uh, HasNain, thanks for the 15 bucks HasNain. 15 dollars from HasNain and
[21290.06s -> 21301.25s]  they say Zoworldo. Zoworldo. Zoworldo. Thank you. Uh, that's a lot of money. Thanks a lot.
[21301.25s -> 21307.42s]  Thank you to Good Sir Reginald for the one dollar. That's it. Just one dollar. Thank you.
[21308.99s -> 21312.91s]  Manboy, thanks for the one dollar. These are some Jojo poses. Have fun making them.
[21330.11s -> 21337.09s]  I'm not going to do all of these. There's like a hundred of these. How many of these do I
[21337.09s -> 21348.59s]  have to do? I'm not going to do them. I'll pick out like a few of them maybe, but I'm not,
[21348.59s -> 21351.95s]  that's not even certain that that's what I'm doing by the way. The poll is not even done,
[21352.59s -> 21363.90s]  but anyways, thank you Manboy. Uh, that's an interesting thing that I'm about to do in a
[21363.90s -> 21368.06s]  few days. Uh, Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar Darkstar. Can we send you meme videos
[21368.06s -> 21372.86s]  to watch during bit readings outside of the movie night? No. I'm going to make that really,
[21372.86s -> 21377.98s]  really clear that because of the amount of footage and the amount of random stuff,
[21378.86s -> 21384.54s]  there is way I can't like pre-screen that stuff unless it's going to be for a specific movie night.
[21385.26s -> 21390.70s]  So outside of that movie night, I'm not going to click on like green screen, Jerma,
[21391.58s -> 21396.94s]  me in something because I can't pre-screen them and there could be some awful shit that I
[21396.94s -> 21401.98s]  don't want to like show or watch. You know what I mean? So unfortunately outside of the
[21401.98s -> 21404.94s]  maybe one or two movie nights that we do, it, that's going to be kind of, that's going
[21404.94s -> 21415.07s]  to be it. How often will movie night be? Um, I don't have like a set time or, you know,
[21415.07s -> 21419.87s]  duration. It's just something I wanted to do. We'll see how the first one goes. If there's a
[21419.87s -> 21424.43s]  lot of great submissions, then obviously we'll do it over the course of, you know, a couple
[21424.43s -> 21434.72s]  of streams, maybe if it takes that long. But yeah, thank you Darkstar, 700,000 games.
[21435.44s -> 21439.41s]  Thank you SinisterCorn for the five dollars. SinisterCorn, thanks a lot. Hey Jerma,
[21439.41s -> 21446.70s]  I'm shit-faced. I hope you're not shit-faced. Enjoy streaming. Uh, not tonight though. No wine
[21446.70s -> 21452.45s]  tonight, but hopefully you enjoyed your night. Thanks a lot for the five dollars SinisterCorn.
[21456.19s -> 21460.78s]  Googly-Garrett, thanks for the five dollars. Hey Jerma, I missed the labo bit train,
[21460.78s -> 21464.62s]  but I just wanted to say thank you again for being the wonderful goof ball you are.
[21464.62s -> 21469.66s]  Was super happy you enjoyed my animation and had it put on the second Jerma channel. Here's
[21469.66s -> 21474.30s]  some bits for being so humble. Also, I am at a drawing that Snoozing Copter made. I thought
[21474.30s -> 21476.86s]  you would enjoy it. Here it is. Thanks again for the years of entertainment.
[21477.82s -> 21487.46s]  Uh, thank you Googly-Garrett. Uh, your animation was fucking hilarious, so absolutely.
[21488.02s -> 21498.19s]  And let's take a look at this. Oh, it's a gift. It's a gift cat. Oh, that's awesome.
[21499.52s -> 21502.16s]  Have I seen this before? I think I feel like I've seen this.
[21503.04s -> 21521.81s]  If I haven't, then I'm mistaken, but it's awesome. The cat police. Yeah, the wrong clip.
[21521.81s -> 21533.06s]  Yep. That's that. Very, very good animation. But thank you Googly-Garrett. Thanks for sticking
[21533.06s -> 21539.70s]  around and thanks for being a very talented animator. So, because a lot of people enjoyed
[21539.70s -> 21545.23s]  that. I'm one of them. Thank you FlubbaGut for the one dollar. Who the hell leaves stacks of
[21545.23s -> 21552.86s]  dollars lying around in shelving units? Whose house is this? DivUSP, thanks for three
[21552.86s -> 21558.88s]  dollars. No message. Thank you Div. Again, Div, you give pretty much every single stream
[21559.52s -> 21565.78s]  and although you don't necessarily write messages every single time, thank you. I see your name
[21565.78s -> 21574.42s]  pop up very frequently, so sometimes I see you do write stuff, but thank you. It means a lot.
[21575.81s -> 21579.89s]  LSG Icarus, thanks for the two bucks. Wait, so pots and pans are worth a normal amount
[21579.89s -> 21583.25s]  of money in this game, but a laptop costs fifty two thousand dollars. Well, that's a
[21583.25s -> 21588.75s]  hacking laptop. It means it has special hacking software built into it. So that's,
[21589.39s -> 21592.93s]  you're paying for the brand. You know, it's like Apple. It's the same computer,
[21593.57s -> 21607.57s]  but are you paying fifty two thousand dollars more money? That says the guy that has an iPhone
[21607.57s -> 21616.26s]  and an iPad. Kind of a hypocrite if you ask me. Talking about this guy. Thank you
[21616.26s -> 21619.78s]  Superintendent Chalmers for the one dollar. I ever think of enabling the better twitch.tv
[21620.42s -> 21628.46s]  animated emotes like clap so we can applaud when you do cool things. I don't even have
[21628.46s -> 21646.82s]  better twitch.tv. I have just regular, not even night mode twitch. I can't see Sour Please. No,
[21646.82s -> 21651.76s]  I don't even know what it is. I know it's like a guy dancing. That's all I know.
[21660.08s -> 21662.80s]  You don't use, no I don't use night mode and I don't have better twitch.tv.
[21665.57s -> 21671.58s]  Guys, remember, this is important. Listen, I didn't have a custom HUD in Team Fortress.
[21671.58s -> 21676.62s]  I played with just the default minimal HUD. I didn't have a custom HUD in World of Warcraft
[21676.62s -> 21689.06s]  either. I think maybe I had one small change, but I do. I just go default, man. Yeah, really,
[21689.06s -> 21694.11s]  that's for real. I think I only had a custom HUD in any of these games maybe one time over
[21694.11s -> 21702.74s]  the course of a few, maybe like a month maybe. You can't see my name in light mode. I actually
[21702.74s -> 21708.85s]  can't. I can't see that. Let me see. I can't see your name. I have no idea who you are.
[21710.21s -> 21714.19s]  You're just a mystery person. I don't know who you are. I can't even
[21714.19s -> 21716.59s]  uh select and scroll.
[21721.66s -> 21727.70s]  There are people that told me that I had like pixels on some of my emotes that weren't erased
[21727.70s -> 21736.30s]  and I can't see them because I have light mode on. But anyways, thank you super seal
[21737.18s -> 21740.94s]  for the one dollar. Sorry to ruin the good mood, but because you live in Las Vegas,
[21740.94s -> 21743.98s]  I really should know this. Remember to lock all of your doors and windows.
[21744.86s -> 21754.34s]  And uh call the police when you see this man. It's just like a claymation thing. What is this?
[21755.14s -> 21766.37s]  I don't understand what it's just like. It's like a claymation thing. Thank you super seal.
[21767.17s -> 21774.51s]  I'll be sure to take care of myself. Thank you. It's sir. Thank you. It's Ross Garra.
[21775.31s -> 21784.82s]  Thank you. Oh, that was whoops. My bad. I'm gonna make mistakes. Thank you. Extra
[21785.06s -> 21791.01s]  cheesy for the ten dollars. Extra cheesy. Swiss is piss and cheddar is better. Use this money
[21791.01s -> 21797.60s]  to get some real cheese. I didn't say I hated cheddar. What? When did I? What did I say I hated
[21797.60s -> 21806.08s]  cheddar? I like cheddar, okay? I like cheddar. I just like Swiss a lot. But thank you for the
[21806.08s -> 21812.45s]  ten bucks. Extra cheesy. Fifteen actually. He says did you kill them? Who did I kill?
[21813.01s -> 21818.06s]  I don't know, but thanks for the fifteen dollars uh extra cheesy. It's a lot of money.
[21818.06s -> 21822.78s]  Enraged grandpa also gives ten bucks as well. Thanks for keeping the drunk me entertained.
[21822.78s -> 21830.42s]  But thank you drunk you for hanging out for the night. Hope you had a good time. Thank you so
[21830.42s -> 21835.76s]  much for the ten bucks. Uh good sir Reginald again thanks for the one dollar. They definitely
[21835.76s -> 21844.03s]  took a dump in your drywall. What? Enraged grandpa thank you for the five dollars again
[21844.03s -> 21851.57s]  here. Fifteen. Also take this because drunk me wants you to have it. So many people are
[21851.57s -> 21858.05s]  drunk on a Tuesday. Well uh you what? You want me to like oh how could they do something like
[21858.05s -> 21862.61s]  that? I was drunk on like a Thursday. What was that? That was like a Wednesday. When was that?
[21863.42s -> 21875.15s]  Was that Thursday? Hey it's five o'clock somewhere in the world. As long as you're
[21875.15s -> 21880.27s]  taking care of yourself and you're good to go and you have a few drinks that's all right.
[21880.27s -> 21885.46s]  There's nothing wrong with that. Just like I said know your limits. Know when it's like
[21885.54s -> 21891.60s]  time to be done and like make sure that you take care of yourself you know. It's not a big deal.
[21901.90s -> 21905.02s]  And look remember some people have different schedules right? So like oh well I'm drunk
[21905.02s -> 21909.98s]  on a Tuesday. Well what if that person has Tuesday, Thursday, then Friday off? You know
[21909.98s -> 21914.46s]  what if they have Tuesday? What if they have Tuesday and Wednesday off? That you know and
[21914.46s -> 21917.50s]  you want to hang out have a few drinks. You know it could be a different schedule. You know
[21923.20s -> 21927.82s]  but thank you. Thank you enraged grandpa. Hope you had a good time.

[21970.53s -> 21976.29s]  doing all right in the standings. I mean I wouldn't call it great but it's it's doing
[21976.29s -> 21985.46s]  all right. It's not hasn't hasn't won yet. It hasn't you know it's still competition is still
[21985.46s -> 21995.60s]  going. Uh but I'm gonna meme the fuck out of you if you do these poses. Some prime real
[21995.60s -> 22009.78s]  estate poses that I need to do. Oh god it's not I mean it could lose but if it wins

[22020.59s -> 22024.03s]  I'd like to imagine this game is just you and Vinesauce high drinks when you are not
[22024.03s -> 22028.43s]  streaming. Just Vinnie telling you to break toilets and steal toasters and paper plates
[22028.43s -> 22033.23s]  from people's homes. Anyway my point is how many bits do I need to pay for you and Vinnie to
[22033.23s -> 22050.30s]  rob me? Uh not none. Okay I don't want to rob anybody. Do I know face cam? Oh I just I don't
[22050.30s -> 22054.86s]  really play with face cam. I have it when it's I find it to be necessary or when I have something
[22054.86s -> 22060.00s]  I want to say or something I want to do but I don't know. I typically do not play with face cam.
[22061.97s -> 22066.56s]  You'll see my face plenty though. He'll rob you for free.
[22074.35s -> 22083.84s]  Is it safe to say that you love cox communications? Um no I mean if if we have
[22084.56s -> 22091.04s]  this just liquid lightning liquid internet and we have like no problems really ever again then
[22091.04s -> 22099.78s]  I would I would have be okay with it but it depends because it's I didn't drop any
[22099.78s -> 22105.14s]  frames tonight at all over six plus hours so that's great that's bad and remember because

[22782.52s -> 22784.16s]  Through reasonable steps to find the owner
[22784.20s -> 22787.92s]  It's theft by finding of course if you find $20 on the ground
[22787.92s -> 22791.12s]  I hardly doubt the people will call the cops on you
[22791.12s -> 22795.70s]  But otherwise, you'll have committed a crime finders keepers has no legal merit
[22795.70s -> 22799.18s]  But okay legally speaking if you steal a knob
[22799.18s -> 22803.69s]  If you find an object on the ground and you didn't reasonably try to find the owner

[23072.86s -> 23080.78s]  We get stolen
[23084.18s -> 23090.14s]  We'd be like we'd be like like staked out like camped out while watching it like oh shit here comes a car
[23090.14s -> 23094.98s]  He's pulled up. Oh, man. What's he gonna do that? There's a grant in that brief. He has a fucking cash

[23117.20s -> 23119.36s]  Then anybody gets played he's gone. That guy's gone
[23119.96s -> 23128.17s]  And that would be it. That'd be the whole thing. Why won't you take the case with you?
[23128.65s -> 23130.95s]  Because like you don't want the evidence
[23131.43s -> 23138.24s]  How do I know he's stepping on the gas because his car peels out and he fucking goes 80 miles per hour on the highway

[23749.56s -> 23751.32s]  Thanks for the four dollars and thirty cents, honey chain
[23751.56s -> 23754.66s]  You've read my one dollar bit message in the middle of the stream the other day
[23754.66s -> 23760.88s]  Which was just a jump story that was only partially true. So here's a little to make up for that
[23761.36s -> 23771.87s]  Well, thank you honey chain for your four dollars and thirty cents. He just said I should burn in hell
[23771.87s -> 23774.99s]  I didn't say that I saw it pop up in the chat and my
[23775.83s -> 23788.38s]  Fucking cat person brain decided just to say it my squirrel brain decided it was gonna say it. So I didn't say it
[23793.48s -> 23796.60s]  But thank you. Honey chain for the four dollars and thirty cents
[23797.20s -> 23802.06s]  Hey night fang. Thanks for one dollar. If you need help with Jojo poses watch this video
[23803.97s -> 23805.37s]  well
[23805.37s -> 23808.57s]  Jojo everyone just is already assuming the Jojo
[23809.29s -> 23813.26s]  I'm not gonna stop saying the word Jojo. I'm gonna start calling it like
[23813.66s -> 23815.66s]  I'm gonna start calling it Doki Doki
[23816.18s -> 23819.21s]  People so badly think that Doki Doki is gonna win
[23819.85s -> 23829.07s]  Not so sure still another day. Hey, Valukey. Thanks Valukey for the one dollar
[23829.07s -> 23835.61s]  Yo germ our DND session was Sunday and basically the Castle Griffin Steed arc takes 20 years after Carl went in
[23835.99s -> 23840.56s]  No one has heard from him ever since and Elvin Woods next champion is a brute named Trog
[23841.28s -> 23846.76s]  He yells his own name when he's hurt and runs into battle. We ended up going by the abandoned wagon
[23846.76s -> 23851.96s]  That was a big mistake and had to fight a giant rat deeper in the dungeon. We got to Al Goro
[23851.96s -> 23856.40s]  He was a real boss instead of a one-shot and Trog ended up dying because he ran in headfirst
[23856.40s -> 23858.90s]  Like he always does we'll keep you updated
[23859.38s -> 23871.25s]  Well, they gotta stay away from that wagon. Did you touch the wagon? That's probably what happened, but I'm glad your session went well
[23871.65s -> 23873.65s]  That sounds like a lot of fun
[23873.65s -> 23876.72s]  Thank You Valukey and
[23876.72s -> 23878.48s]  Docs and thanks to the one dollar boy. Oh boy
[23878.48s -> 23883.16s]  I just got robbed 12 times in a week and some asshole threw bricks through my window three times
[23883.36s -> 23886.92s]  I'm giving you this money. So maybe it'll be a good some good karma to make him go away
[23886.92s -> 23892.72s]  I heard from Paul that he was screaming about China and interrupted his midnight work twice
[23893.16s -> 23904.57s]  Who the fuck even is this guy golly good gracious? I sure do hope the wacky police stop him. Thank you and Docs and
[23905.09s -> 23917.78s]  Thank You thievious for the two bucks. This is for the upcoming grand reveal of your
[23919.17s -> 23921.05s]  Stand up power
[23921.05s -> 23924.69s]  Stando power during a green screen and he goes
[23925.33s -> 23928.64s]  Rye why
[23929.56s -> 23931.98s]  Rye
[23931.98s -> 23941.54s]  Wr. I don't get it. I don't understand. I'm sorry. I meant the elephant green screen. Anyway, look elephant
[23945.56s -> 23950.01s]  Elephant green screen. There's no elephant on there. I'm like I don't like it
[23951.21s -> 23956.09s]  $12,000 animal surprise for you guys. They're looking of right under like into the studio on an elephant
[23962.10s -> 23966.72s]  Thank you. The orange pyro ranger for the one dollar. I hope you're not too overwhelmed by the Jojo poses
[23968.36s -> 23974.86s]  You know, maybe I'll just veto the Jojo poses and put dab back on the list
[23978.50s -> 23980.50s]  Everyone's so convinced
[23981.18s -> 23990.82s]  Now I already I already made already did my veto choices can't go back on them
[23990.82s -> 23993.54s]  No, just as long as I don't have to do the gnome video. I
[23994.10s -> 24005.37s]  would rather
[24005.37s -> 24009.60s]  Like I would rather think get a bad burn
[24010.20s -> 24012.86s]  Then recreate the gnome video
[24013.60s -> 24018.53s]  But I would rather like fall off a bike
[24019.17s -> 24023.58s]  Going like 15 miles per hour then recreate the gnome video
[24024.14s -> 24043.17s]  just do that if I had the option you can either recreate the whole gnome video or
[24044.21s -> 24049.81s]  Hold the handlebars and let the wheels spin downhill and intentionally fall over on the bike
[24050.45s -> 24052.62s]  I'd be like, oh
[24052.86s -> 24057.68s]  Well, I thought be okay in a few days like it would probably take like maybe a week or two of recovery
[24058.28s -> 24060.28s]  That I had my bones would heal
[24060.56s -> 24063.32s]  But I would never be able to get rid of
[24064.12s -> 24068.76s]  People making me a gnome in the gnome video that would last forever. That would last for life
[24069.16s -> 24089.34s]  Bones heal man. Haha. Jeremy fell off a bike, but thank you. Thank you extra cheesy again for one dollar here
[24089.34s -> 24091.98s]  Jeremy you are the first person I ever gave virtual currency to is
[24092.82s -> 24095.50s]  Steal the China the new toy boat
[24095.86s -> 24101.30s]  Well, steal the China is not a tongue twister
[24101.30s -> 24104.82s]  Steal the China is a painting steal the China is what you
[24105.18s -> 24109.66s]  Chant when you're breaking into a person's house that has that painting. That's the only time it's useful
[24110.26s -> 24118.30s]  Thank you. Hey bro. Look, thanks for the five dollars. Hey mate feeling pretty hungry
[24118.30s -> 24124.11s]  But only had like ten bucks left in my bank account. Have it. Why would you give me half of that?
[24124.11s -> 24125.55s]  Go get like food
[24125.55s -> 24132.70s]  Hey mate feeling pretty hungry, but only had ten dollars left my bank account. Have it you have
[24133.26s -> 24136.39s]  You can eat go you can eat something don't
[24136.83s -> 24138.43s]  Take care of yourself first
[24138.43s -> 24141.14s]  But thank you
[24141.14s -> 24144.22s]  Devakati, thanks for the one dollar. They say you w you
[24144.94s -> 24146.88s]  glumps
[24146.88s -> 24150.66s]  Within there's two asterisks next to it. Thank you
[24151.58s -> 24155.38s]  Cosmic Moses, thanks for the one dollar. Thank you for attempting to reenact this scene for almost an hour
[24155.90s -> 24169.71s]  We're recreating this scene
[24169.99s -> 24177.50s]  It's funny. You mentioned that because me and my brother
[24178.18s -> 24180.18s]  That's from home alone
[24180.66s -> 24186.62s]  Me and my brother used to rewind the VHS and watch that part over and over again because it thought was the funniest part
[24186.62s -> 24187.78s]  in the whole movie
[24187.82s -> 24193.74s]  He just whips as hard as he can. It's the only time in any of the two movies
[24194.18s -> 24197.54s]  That there's ever a real violent retaliation
[24198.14s -> 24204.23s]  to Kevin McCallister who is you know, the main character the only point in the whole movie and
[24204.71s -> 24209.13s]  He's trying to hit him with a brick in the fucking head as hard as he can
[24209.51s -> 24218.62s]  He throws it down as hard as he can like he's trying to kill Kevin McCallister here
[24222.18s -> 24226.86s]  Like if that he would have just killed Kevin
[24227.46s -> 24235.19s]  That brick would have hit him right in the fucking face. They say they're gonna kill him the whole movie
[24235.19s -> 24237.69s]  Yeah, they go like
[24243.69s -> 24246.97s]  But never is there any real violent retaliation like there is here
[24247.37s -> 24257.78s]  If you haven't seen that movie in a long time count the amount of times that Joe Pesci Joe Pesci says razza frazza
[24258.42s -> 24261.74s]  Marv is the real psycho
[24261.78s -> 24278.78s]  Just like the cartoon gibberish that Yosemite Sam used to do
[24279.26s -> 24286.11s]  But yes that cosmic mosaic that that is that is a great scene
[24288.16s -> 24292.04s]  Well, hold on like all right. That's a that's a great movie. It's a very funny movie
[24295.02s -> 24298.42s]  That's a great scene
[24300.47s -> 24302.67s]  Never mind
[24302.67s -> 24304.35s]  Thank you to
[24304.35s -> 24310.30s]  Brolok again gave $10 total Brolok. What the heck man. I'd like to have a laid-back chat
[24310.30s -> 24316.50s]  But the obvious plyer no racism or bigotry don't talk about politics and just try not to be a psycho
[24317.14s -> 24330.82s]  Yeah, copy and paste that for the rules of the green screen stream. Those are the rules there
[24334.97s -> 24341.05s]  Garfield the Monday killer click here to find out with one dollar sniff sniff. That's odd. Okay, there is a savory dog smell
[24341.05s -> 24343.05s]  Sorry, I ever doubted you right?
[24343.49s -> 24349.39s]  Well, what I what you didn't know was that all dogs are actually eldritch horrors with hypnotic sense
[24349.67s -> 24352.83s]  Make humans succumb to their will anyways, where's my ten bucks? I
[24353.55s -> 24364.38s]  Hope he does the meme dances from tick-tock. I'm not doing any I'm not doing any meme dances
[24364.38s -> 24366.38s]  They've already been taken off the table completely
[24366.94s -> 24372.51s]  They've already been vetoed. They've been pre vetoed even before I pre vetoed them. They were deleted
[24372.51s -> 24380.16s]  I don't know what that is, but I'm not gonna not doing it and finally Elizabeth
[24380.16s -> 24382.42s]  Thank you for the one dollar suck a brick out of my ass
[24383.14s -> 24386.68s]  It sounds like it would be very very uncomfortable
[24387.68s -> 24391.54s]  Thank you for the one dollar though. And now we're gonna go through the credits
[24391.82s -> 24397.17s]  Let's see the

[24470.96s -> 24473.94s]  And these these friends have been going a long time, too
[24474.54s -> 24476.54s]  But I told you guys I

[24484.86s -> 24489.26s]  we've been doing a lot of seven eight nine hour streams the last couple weeks here and
[24491.15s -> 24493.62s]  I'm all for it. I'm having a great time
[24493.62s -> 24505.67s]  It's good to be back here on a scale of one to ten. How many apples have you eaten in the past two years?
[24506.35s -> 24510.88s]  Probably like 80. No, that's not even true. We'd be like two
[24511.40s -> 24516.48s]  No, no, no, no more than that. I'm gonna say like 15. No like 25

[24570.35s -> 24575.47s]  Hey, can you just jump into random lobbies or do you still need to give people like a 500-digit friend code?
[24576.19s -> 24581.56s]  Because I'll do whatever I can. I mean I was planning on playing it with as many people I wanted to
