[0.31s -> 13.50s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some more Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
[13.50s -> 22.50s]  Now, this is the Zombies mode in Black Ops 2. This actually was very heavily requested that I do this, especially on Transit and especially by myself.
[22.50s -> 27.50s]  So this is a solo run. I'm gonna do the Transit mode like you're seeing, and I have no idea what's going on, by the way.
[27.50s -> 34.68s]  This is the first time I've ever, ever played Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies, ever. Never. Never done this, never.
[34.68s -> 39.68s]  So I have no idea what's gonna happen. All I know is I'm supposed to shoot these zombies, and when.
[39.68s -> 46.80s]  So we're gonna go with that. I don't know what to do. I've seen a couple videos on that. What the hell is that?
[46.80s -> 51.22s]  What? What, there's like power-ups in this mode? Cool.
[51.22s -> 58.47s]  Probably have limited ammo. I probably shouldn't just be shooting like six bullets at a time, but let's hope I don't screw this up.
[58.47s -> 65.29s]  Black Ops 2 zombies! Whatever this is, I'm buying it. Sweet.
[65.29s -> 70.86s]  So now what, we just like wait around and just like sit around? Whatever, I can do that.
[70.86s -> 76.16s]  Oh, power-up's running out. Power-up's running out. I gotta find somebody to shoot. Power-up! Oh, my power-up's blinking.
[76.16s -> 79.53s]  Blinking like an old Super Nintendo boss.
[79.53s -> 88.34s]  Well, come on in. Come on in, Joppies. There's a one-head shot.
[88.34s -> 104.06s]  What? What? That's it? I just lost. I just lost. I just lost right there. I got hit. Oh my god, that was terrible.
[105.06s -> 108.66s]  Oh, rebuild. Rebuild. Make sure there's nobody behind me, man.
[108.66s -> 114.02s]  I feel like I'm playing The Sims. It's like the same buying noise.
[115.02s -> 122.18s]  You buy like a sofa. All right, am I missing something here or no? It's just slow at first.
[122.18s -> 133.89s]  Anybody else out here? Which one of you zombie bricks want to take it to the face? Rebuild.
[133.89s -> 137.89s]  No! No! What? No! You put it where it didn't even come from!
[137.89s -> 142.58s]  Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
[142.58s -> 157.53s]  Jeopardy Baby Beatbox Edition. Where are the enemies? Oh, cool. You spawned like an enemy.
[157.53s -> 162.99s]  Oh, you're on fire. All right. I'm going to change position here.
[162.99s -> 168.42s]  Oh, what? What? This lady just came out of nowhere. Do they spawn behind you?
[168.42s -> 175.48s]  They spawn behind you! I'm going to lose! I'm going to lose on fire!
[175.48s -> 182.55s]  No! Wait! Wait! Time out! Grenade! Oh, eat grenades! Everybody eat a grenade!
[183.98s -> 185.98s]  Oh, Jesus! I'm still alive!
[187.34s -> 190.74s]  Oh my God, what's happening?
[195.18s -> 197.18s]  Okay, that was insane
[203.26s -> 206.62s]  You know what happened once I moved from my little area over here
[207.90s -> 213.90s]  It got crazy like I ain't moving from this spot again. I could promise you that anyone behind me
[214.62s -> 216.62s]  Get away from my spot. Get away from my little area
[216.62s -> 223.90s]  Oh, no, wait, wait, I'm not ready. I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready for this. Get away from me
[225.26s -> 228.96s]  So after the three fails in a row
[228.96s -> 235.23s]  I think I finally figured it out and we're gonna try and go for gold here and by gold
[235.23s -> 237.47s]  I want to at least make it to like wave five
[238.03s -> 242.43s]  Okay, I'll be like happy if I make it to like wave five or six or something
[242.67s -> 249.78s]  I just can't keep dying at like wave two. All right, we're at wave four. Where is this guy? Where is this guy?
[253.06s -> 259.33s]  I got I got some bullets. I'll be okay wave four. Oh, there they are. There they are
[260.54s -> 268.94s]  See ya. Uh, I don't really want a hug. You can take that out of here. You bastard
[269.58s -> 276.40s]  Do I have enough money for the smg? I think that's an smg. Pretty sure it is. Let's go get it times two
[276.48s -> 278.48s]  What what? Oh times two. Oh
[280.34s -> 281.78s]  Get exploded
[281.78s -> 287.62s]  Wow, they're coming in fast coming in hot coming in hot coming in hot coming in hot jump over. No
[289.62s -> 294.05s]  Not screwing this up again, you're not gonna like take this from me. I'm getting away five
[294.29s -> 296.29s]  You understand that you understand that lady?
[296.45s -> 302.74s]  I'm getting away five right now and i'm gonna be the master of call of duty black ops 2
[303.44s -> 307.52s]  I get this would be so much easier with like another person because you could all like
[308.24s -> 310.96s]  You can like talk to each other and know what's happening and know where you're going
[310.96s -> 314.80s]  And this is a bad place for me to be right now for sure. Yeah, I just killed myself
[314.80s -> 317.38s]  I think I need to be very very very
[323.63s -> 326.91s]  Oh my god, just eye of the tiger eye of the tiger I got out
[327.31s -> 332.30s]  I used eye of the tiger and I got out. Can you believe it? Yeah, everyone right there is done
[335.33s -> 344.70s]  Eye of the tiger that's like crawling. At least I got to wave five
[345.02s -> 348.34s]  That's all I wanted to get to wave five
[349.58s -> 357.07s]  At least uh, oh man. Well, thank you for watching. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed
[357.79s -> 360.75s]  Uh my black ops 2 pro- ow my elbow
