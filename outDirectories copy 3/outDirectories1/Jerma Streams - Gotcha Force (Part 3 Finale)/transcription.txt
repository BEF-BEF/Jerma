[0.82s -> 9.96s]  Mount Fiji. Mount Fiji. Yeah, yeah. Whatever, Mount Fuji. It's fine.
[9.96s -> 16.25s]  Somebody asked me what my favorite mountain was in the pre-stream chat and I said Mount
[16.25s -> 24.30s]  Fiji because I like Fiji water. And I thought for three or four seconds that Mount Fiji,
[24.30s -> 30.92s]  Fiji was a Fiji mountain. That's where it came from. But that's not where it comes from.
[30.92s -> 38.94s]  Maybe it is. I don't know. The Fiji River? Fiji pond? I don't know. I thought it was Mount
[38.94s -> 42.22s]  Fiji for 10 seconds. And I was like, no, it's actually Mount Fuji. They're not different
[42.22s -> 55.51s]  things. Fiji is the place. The mountain is Fiji. Right. Fiji is a country. Okay. Well,
[55.51s -> 60.50s]  is there a mountain in Fiji? Whatever it is, that's the one I like. That's my favorite mountain.
[69.18s -> 75.99s]  Anyways, probably there's exactly one mountain. Well, that's good. That's my favorite one.
[80.09s -> 92.60s]  Show us your mountain wallpaper. I don't have mountain wallpaper. Not anymore. It's been
[92.60s -> 99.35s]  changed. And you don't get to see it. That's for me only. But today we're going to finish
[99.35s -> 106.09s]  Gotcha Force. I have to sell all my toys today. I've got to give them away and sell them and get
[106.09s -> 114.55s]  rid of them. I got boxes of them. Mom's making me do this. She came into my room and said,
[115.74s -> 120.30s]  it's time for you to get rid of all these toys. They're everywhere. It's ridiculous.
[121.72s -> 128.07s]  Don't need to keep every toy from when you were 15. Just come on, get the f**king out of here,
[128.07s -> 134.30s]  Ma. I want to get rid of them. I'm 35. Whatever. I have like toys and s**t. I like them.
[134.86s -> 153.42s]  Leave me alone, Ma. Break. Toys from when you were 15. She doesn't understand. Voting to ban Mom.
[154.14s -> 159.50s]  Don't talk to your mother like that. I didn't. She left the room and I said, f**king what the f**k,
[159.50s -> 167.27s]  Ma? Shut up. The door was closed. She was gone. I went, yes, mother. The door closed and I went,
[167.83s -> 176.60s]  shut up. Stupid dumb Mom. We're going to finish Gotcha Force though. I feel like we can get this
[176.60s -> 189.61s]  done. Very fun game. We're going to see the end. Hopefully. Vito, please. All right, I'll get to it.
[190.41s -> 196.57s]  I'm going to, I'm getting to it. You want to see Vito so bad. He's going to be on the screen in
[196.57s -> 203.94s]  about five seconds. Camera's not on. There he is. Be hurry, Vito, Vito. There, there is Vito.
[203.94s -> 209.21s]  It's the name of the character. I'm so glad that you wanted to see him so badly.
[213.03s -> 216.47s]  There's a lot of enthusiasm here. I'm seeing Vito in all capitals.
[218.10s -> 223.24s]  Holy s**t. You guys really want to see him. All right. Give the people what they want.
[226.39s -> 231.58s]  Anyways, let's go. Welcome back. I'm going to finish this today and then tomorrow we're going
[231.58s -> 239.69s]  to play Patapon, which by the way, I actually looked into Patapon and it was a PSP game. Oh,
[239.69s -> 243.61s]  wow. Patapon. It's cool. It's such a good game. You should play it. I thought this was like a two
[243.61s -> 258.36s]  to three hour experience. Patapon is like a 20 hour game. How, how is Patapon as long as like
[258.36s -> 273.80s]  The Witcher 2. Don't worry about it. Oh, he doesn't know. I'm pogging in real life so much right now.
[273.80s -> 280.90s]  Yeah. Well, I'm going to try it. See if I play the whole thing. Witcher started at three. Don't,
[280.90s -> 287.30s]  they don't make games like they used to. All right, let's get going. We have our team. If
[287.30s -> 296.07s]  you don't know what gacha force is, you're in for a huge pog moment. Actually, let's do this one.
[296.07s -> 305.90s]  This one, this one's like dark. Fight in the air battle. All right. Air battle, huh? Well,
[305.90s -> 311.58s]  this ain't going to work. You want to see your beautiful face? We cannot. Oh, look at this mess.
[313.34s -> 318.92s]  It's a mess. I have to get rid of them. I have to start to, I'm not going to use some of these.
[319.56s -> 324.33s]  All right. It's an air battle. So we need air. Just give, I gotta get rid of them all.
[324.33s -> 338.63s]  Just delete the force. Okay. What? Why are you all the way over here? All right. Wind Valkyrie
[341.06s -> 347.64s]  and then ice Valkyrie. Where's the airplane? Air, actually airplanes first. It's an air battle. For
[347.64s -> 363.32s]  God's sake, then bring Valkyrie, a sniper girl, battery man. No, maybe revolver gunman. Just to
[363.32s -> 379.26s]  like take people off. What should I use? Do all the tornado Valkyrie. I still got money and
[380.78s -> 387.30s]  soldier and one more. I can do the ninja. It's always in the way. I went to level two, a ninja.
[387.30s -> 397.85s]  There we go. All right, let's do the air battle. Giant sword, ghost samurai. Um, we'll see. This
[397.85s -> 405.06s]  might have been a dumb idea. We'll find out. Jump King waiting. I deleted my save. It's not
[405.06s -> 411.91s]  going to, I'll never open that game ever again. Like that's a fact. I, I ain't ever opening that
[411.91s -> 432.97s]  game again. Why would I do that at this point? I deleted my save. Download a new save. I'm not
[432.97s -> 438.09s]  going to download a new save. I've, why do I, I've, the only reason why I opened it is because I had
[438.09s -> 456.81s]  like four drinks at that point. Ooh, sorry. Get up in the air. It was four whole drinks.
[458.94s -> 463.26s]  Yeah. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't just tell you that I, I couldn't walk. I just said I had some
[463.26s -> 468.87s]  drinks and it was like, ah yeah, let's play Jump King. That's funny. And then I deleted the save
[468.87s -> 473.16s]  accidentally. All right, this is not going to work out. They're not fast enough. They're not even
[473.16s -> 484.18s]  remotely fast enough for this. It was five at that point. Well, whatever. Yeah, they're not fast enough.
[489.22s -> 498.15s]  I'm just being outpaced completely. This ain't going to happen. The only, you know how this
[498.15s -> 515.46s]  happens with this character only. That's going to fly into people and got it. Okay. Same deal.
[516.86s -> 523.59s]  Again, any other game waiting room? Well, I'll see you tomorrow. That's how long you're going
[523.59s -> 547.14s]  to have to wait. See you tomorrow. This character is actually really good. Atapog. I'm looking, I
[547.14s -> 562.09s]  look, people have told me to play that for like a year. I'm looking forward to it. So it's an RPG.
[562.97s -> 574.10s]  I thought it was a rhythm game. It is a rhythm game. It's both.
[575.43s -> 586.97s]  Really? Is it like a story? Yes. Is it a good story or is it a story that's in the background
[586.97s -> 603.43s]  because it had to be there? Give me the truth. It's good. Okay. Okay. It has nudity. Don't stream it.
[603.43s -> 609.16s]  I think I'll be all right. I don't think that's going to be a problem. By the way, I got my ass
[609.16s -> 616.95s]  kicked. Is this the last person? No, no, no. I got one more wing person. Oh, you're that high in the
[616.95s -> 636.17s]  air. I got to get in close. Kill. Quit. Okay. Only two or three more. This is it, I think.
[636.89s -> 645.66s]  Should be it. I didn't knock that off. How? All right. This is my last person. I got to,
[645.66s -> 663.61s]  okay, here we go. Let's see if the spam can help me here. Die. Yes. Yes. When's it going to have a
[663.61s -> 669.13s]  meltdown? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Oh shit. That actually, hey, what was it? What was it? What was
[669.13s -> 673.13s]  it? What was it? What was it? What happens every time? What happens every time? What happens every
[673.13s -> 683.06s]  time? What was it? What was it? Come on. What just fell and like crashed down here? Yes. We
[683.06s -> 692.39s]  sensor bar. It happens every time. It's sitting on top of my monitor. And if I move my desk even
[692.39s -> 697.59s]  like a little bit, it just falls and crashes down. And it's, dude, it's crazy when that happens.
[698.31s -> 707.21s]  It's like, it weighs like less than like 12 ounces. It goes like crash. It's crazy. It's
[707.21s -> 723.62s]  worth reacting that harshly over. Oh, I got another plane. The crashes and I go, what the fuck?
[724.26s -> 731.00s]  Even though the thing weighs less than a 10th of a pound. He's just overreacting for the camera at
[731.00s -> 751.80s]  this point. Asshole. Wait a minute. What? I got one. Gatling gunner. Ooh. All right. I thought the
[751.80s -> 764.90s]  game crashed for a second. I was like, okay, he's going to keep going. Violet attacker.
[768.98s -> 787.10s]  Oh, funny Gatling go brr. Oh, all right. Let's make an actual team now. Let's see. Long range
[789.45s -> 797.05s]  and grenade and then Gatling gun. The gadget booker was in the military. This great man with a
[797.05s -> 804.41s]  pivoted jaw sweeps away the bad guys with deadly fire from his special Gatling. What was a pivoted
[804.41s -> 817.18s]  jaw? I feel like his jaw goes sideways at that point. Pivoting jaw? What does that mean?
[824.34s -> 834.38s]  Uh, this is the fastest one, I guess. Vulcan power beam and napalm bomb. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[834.38s -> 838.63s]  It's a plane. That's all you need to know. Who cares? This one on the other hand, this is
[838.63s -> 845.34s]  different. This thing's got a bomb. Both power bomb. Fighters have got your book who was created
[845.34s -> 851.59s]  during the interplanetary mega board war. He can attack the ground with bombs. All right.
[852.94s -> 857.11s]  I'll try it. Let's, let's use the planes. Are these just the exact same things have different
[857.11s -> 868.54s]  colors? Yeah, they are. But they're still good. This thing's level three. And now with the Gatling
[868.54s -> 874.38s]  gunner. I want to try, I want to try you first actually. I feel like I'm really going to like
[874.38s -> 886.15s]  this character. All right. 420 though. That's a lot. Who else can I put in here? Exclamation point.
[886.15s -> 903.38s]  Up dog. What the? Dude. Uh, I can't use you. That's, that's good. I'll give it a try. Um,
[903.38s -> 911.94s]  man is home. A big cockroach parade. Please help me Vito. There are lots of death force
[911.94s -> 923.03s]  boards that look like roaches. Let's go. Ever played custom robo behind me? We'll play that
[923.03s -> 927.35s]  eventually. I want to play this first because I remember playing this game when I was just a
[927.35s -> 939.85s]  child. Holy shit. This is awesome. Oh my God. It has so many, wait, what, what does the grenade do?
[939.85s -> 949.22s]  There's a very little bomb. That's cool. Long reload, but he can't move when he shoots. It's
[949.22s -> 959.38s]  to stand still. So it's hard to, how many are there? I guess I can jump and move and do it
[959.38s -> 963.14s]  like that. But I can't, I have to stand still. Feel pretty good. Probably for like those big
[963.14s -> 982.74s]  planes would be good. This is what this whole mission is. Killing the cockroaches. Do we get
[982.74s -> 999.10s]  any bigger cockroaches? When's the next Brownie rant? Oh, let me tell you. Brownie rant waiting
[999.10s -> 1020.02s]  room. What the fuck is that? I don't, what do I need to know what you mean by that?
[1024.97s -> 1034.33s]  In before. Tell me you guys just, I swear there's just AI characters in here that have been
[1034.33s -> 1040.41s]  programmed to just write something strange every day. Just, I, you know, let's just program my
[1040.41s -> 1047.06s]  fucking weird bot. Just write weird shit every day. What am I going to write today? What's
[1047.06s -> 1053.78s]  a bot going to just pull from the random? How about in before bigger cock? That makes sense.
[1053.78s -> 1067.45s]  Gosh, of course though. This is interesting. What is this? Monsters? Bugs? Oh, wow. I don't care
[1067.45s -> 1074.06s]  about this at all. Hopefully. Hey, did he read it? I want to see if he reads this. He did. He
[1074.06s -> 1080.82s]  always does. He always does. So it's perfect. Tomorrow I'm just going to write, put a cheese
[1080.82s -> 1087.19s]  sandwich down my underwear. It took me two full hours to clean it up. Maybe I can probably read
[1087.19s -> 1103.51s]  that tomorrow. Weirdos get out. Weirdos get out. Oh, I don't think you want to say that. I think
[1103.51s -> 1111.86s]  that's like, Oh, that's, I would have to leave. You're getting rid of me. I don't think this
[1111.86s -> 1133.18s]  channel would collapse if that was the case. Wait, there's a person. No weirdo. Weird. Don't,
[1133.18s -> 1139.82s]  don't weirdos here at that point. It'd be like, all right, well, I'm, I think I'll be done at
[1139.82s -> 1147.03s]  that point. It'd be like, nah, I think that's good. I'd be streaming to my mother. It's the only one
[1147.03s -> 1179.29s]  that would be left. She's watching your streams right now. Oh, maybe I think I have the combination
[1179.29s -> 1191.45s]  of this. No, of course not. Of course not. Your mom heard you say the in before line,
[1192.09s -> 1200.12s]  but that's all right. My mother knows this is a comedy stream. It's okay. It's just, it's a,
[1200.12s -> 1206.20s]  it's a comedy stream. You know, we talk about comedy, we do thought projects. She knows,
[1206.20s -> 1215.27s]  she's on, she knows it. This is supposed to be comedy. And sometimes we play games that Jeremy
[1215.27s -> 1241.05s]  likes. I mean, no, we don't. Sometimes we play video games that Jeremy wants to play. That happens
[1241.05s -> 1264.90s]  to be the last few days. No, you have to play games that I like. Oh, no, is this the McDonald's
[1264.90s -> 1273.75s]  thing again? No, it's not the McDonald's thing again. You guys know how many video games exist?
[1274.47s -> 1283.88s]  To be able to play your favorite video game, I'd have to stream like 10,000 more times.
[1285.00s -> 1289.48s]  You know what I mean? Like everyone has a favorite video game. I can't play your
[1289.48s -> 1301.54s]  favorite video game. How does this bomb work? You just drop it? I can't tell where it's going.
[1301.54s -> 1328.73s]  This thing's dead already. Benched. I was gonna say flying around. My favorite video game is called,
[1329.13s -> 1332.17s]  my favorite video game is, Jerma hits himself in the crotch with a hammer.
[1347.24s -> 1354.58s]  Yeah, I know the remake of that one wasn't very good. You know, just the original, you know,
[1354.58s -> 1357.86s]  they tried to bring it back and it's like, dude, you hit yourself in the crotch with a hammer and
[1357.86s -> 1362.02s]  like fucked up your shit. It's already been destroyed. Like you're going to try it again?
[1362.90s -> 1364.42s]  You can't, no, the remakes suck.
[1388.94s -> 1396.36s]  No, I missed. No, I didn't. Yeah, I did. This guy's tough. Yeah, they, these two are actually tough.
[1396.36s -> 1420.98s]  Kind of, okay, be quiet. Oh, you fucking dick. Come on. I got the advantage right here.
[1423.11s -> 1427.51s]  Oh, this is the perfect thing that could have happened. He's so far away and his movement is
[1427.51s -> 1453.48s]  terrible. Wow. I can't believe that is that. What a spawn. Unbelievable. Liar gunner. I already have
[1453.48s -> 1466.46s]  one of these and I don't really like them. Okay. How, what do we got? Uh, uh, too many planes,
[1467.34s -> 1475.19s]  too many planes. I want to replace one of these planes. One of my, I want to try this again
[1475.19s -> 1480.47s]  because I feel like it didn't get a good representation of what it was. Try it again.
[1481.03s -> 1495.86s]  Let's have you go first. Just change the music. That's all we ask. Um, you want to turn the music
[1495.86s -> 1517.62s]  off? No, no, no, no. Music's driving me insane. Oh no. Yes, please turn it off.
[1525.27s -> 1527.35s]  You don't like that every single five minutes.
[1536.87s -> 1540.33s]  All right, let's drop the bomb. I get it. How big is the explosion?
[1541.21s -> 1544.73s]  It's all right. You got it. You really got to time it though. Let's see if I got it.
[1546.68s -> 1569.32s]  Uh, kind of sucks actually. This is really bad. How am I supposed to hit anybody with this? All
[1569.32s -> 1591.13s]  right. I, that was a direct hit and it was awful. Bench. $250 for this. Let's see how many fucking
[1591.13s -> 1605.21s]  skins you bought in Fortnite. How many, how many Fortnite skins? How many, how many like
[1605.21s -> 1622.63s]  counter-strike skins do you have? You get a knife yet? Nah, but fuck this guy for getting a GameCube
[1622.63s -> 1637.90s]  game. You have two hats. Has the hat market like crashed or are people, is people still buying
[1637.90s -> 1651.14s]  them? Are they still expensive? I could have emulated this for free and you could have,
[1651.14s -> 1658.23s]  you could have bought a knife at Walmart and then spray painted it green. Do we really have to have
[1658.23s -> 1695.29s]  this conversation? What is value? Somebody kill me because I can't aim at, I just, I blow this,
[1695.29s -> 1704.62s]  just get this, get this plane. I can't just, what would you do with a green painted knife?
[1705.26s -> 1712.18s]  I don't know. You would, you would put it in your closet and look at it from time to time.
[1713.21s -> 1720.14s]  Ah, yeah. That's the green one. Where's the red one? There it is. Look at it for a second.
[1720.70s -> 1737.02s]  What am I talking about? I'm talking about how spending $2,000 on a CSGO knife skin is the same
[1737.02s -> 1745.96s]  thing as just buying a real knife in real life and putting crayons on it and having like your
[1745.96s -> 1769.93s]  friends come over and look at it. Funko puff. Yeah. So, so we, what, what's with the criticizing
[1770.65s -> 1778.33s]  of what use or I spend our dollars on? If I buy a thousand Funko puffs, who gives a shit?
[1778.33s -> 1784.81s]  If you buy a $2,000 CSGO knife, who cares? If I get gotcha force, it's like my favorite game and
[1784.81s -> 1790.65s]  I want to collect it and it's $200 and what? What's the difference? There is no difference.
[1791.29s -> 1806.90s]  What about somebody said collecting bongs? I don't know. It's your money. What are you going
[1806.90s -> 1818.49s]  to tell you? What? I think I have an opinion of you collecting bongs. Did you have the space for
[1818.49s -> 1822.01s]  this? Well, that's all. That's my only, here's my only question. Do you have the space for this?
[1822.89s -> 1826.89s]  Yeah, I got plenty of space. All right, then collect as many fucking bongs as you want.
[1827.77s -> 1867.24s]  He's endorsing bong collection. I only smoke tobacco out of my bong with a happy face.
[1869.22s -> 1874.90s]  All right. Well, then you can use a tobacco bong as all this shit is the same.
[1875.70s -> 1881.59s]  When you go over somebody's house and they have like 25 bongs with like,
[1881.59s -> 1886.23s]  this one's got like Jimi Hendrix on it. This one's like green. It has lava lamps.
[1886.95s -> 1889.51s]  You do realize that you probably look at your like TF2 backpack.
[1890.31s -> 1906.31s]  It's all the same shit. This is like intro. It's like collecting things and who cares?
[1907.03s -> 1929.53s]  Is this consumerism? All right. I can tell you guys are bored. I can tell. I can smell it from a
[1929.53s -> 1946.98s]  million miles away. Unfortunately, your boredom is going to have to continue for the next four
[1946.98s -> 1955.62s]  to six hours because I'm going to play my fucking $2,000 CSGO knife skin until I'm satisfied looking
[1955.62s -> 1981.54s]  at it with all my friends over. And I lost because of you. The argument is you could have
[1981.54s -> 1989.50s]  emulated it. Okay. So I, all right. Yeah. So I, I can like, I can watch a streamer open up knives
[1990.14s -> 1993.10s]  and like, I can watch him hold a knife in his hands. I don't own it though.
[1993.82s -> 2005.14s]  I'm pretending to own it. Right? That could happen. I could download a JPEG of a CSGO knife
[2005.14s -> 2017.21s]  and put it on my background on my desktop. Is that the same thing? That mission was too hard.
[2017.85s -> 2032.39s]  Do I look like I know what a J? Wait, you guys don't know JPEG? Holy shit. In the middle of this,
[2032.39s -> 2045.32s]  somebody gave a fucking ton of money. Do I know what emulation is? I used dolphin like a month ago.
[2045.32s -> 2074.34s]  You guys are fucking bored. Uh, phylatrial lich gave $250 in that's 25,000 fucking bits.
[2078.79s -> 2083.11s]  And they say, here's money to buy another copy of Gotcha Force just for you to flex on chat.
[2084.07s -> 2100.42s]  I don't want another copy of Gotcha Force. Donating to millionaires. Are we going to do,
[2100.42s -> 2130.01s]  are we going to bring that up again? Worth house. All right. I'm just going to play my game and I'm,
[2130.89s -> 2141.43s]  I'll see, I'll talk to you guys like an hour. See you guys in an hour. He's not denying. We've
[2141.43s -> 2146.63s]  already gone over the fact that I don't have a million dollars. I don't have a million dollars.
[2148.78s -> 2152.22s]  I'm not a millionaire. Why do we have to keep talking about this?
[2170.26s -> 2209.80s]  He's lying. He's lying about the company he owns. That would be fucking, that would be,
[2209.80s -> 2231.50s]  I think that's probably illegal. Offshore accounts. No, I don't have any of those.
[2232.30s -> 2254.28s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. All right. I see it. I see it. I see it. He's a liar.
[2254.28s -> 2261.61s]  Liar. Let's see. What does it say? My net worth between one and $5 million in 2019.
[2262.57s -> 2266.57s]  Okay. This is, this is one, this is so inaccurate. It's always like a joke.
[2267.77s -> 2279.26s]  Do you guys know that these websites have no fucking idea? They have absolutely no idea.
[2285.30s -> 2289.78s]  You know, these websites pull from how many like clicks your website got.
[2292.50s -> 2299.62s]  Monthly traffic was 68,000 people per month, which that means he's worth $60 million dollars.
[2305.80s -> 2309.48s]  Somebody showed me one of these websites before and it said I was worth like $200 billion dollars.
[2313.90s -> 2321.21s]  Yeah, that's great. So I'm worth like the total GDP of like 50 countries on earth. Sure. I guess.
[2321.85s -> 2343.61s]  Okay. Sure. Five million fucking dollars. Get the fuck out of here. Celebrity money.
[2345.18s -> 2348.38s]  God, this is probably like a data mining website. Like, why are you clicking these?
[2359.91s -> 2368.73s]  E-celebrity cash. Well, let's wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. Calculator stats.com.
[2369.93s -> 2373.37s]  German nine a five's net worth is approximately $112,000.
[2376.07s -> 2391.32s]  He's a millionaire. He's a fucking millionaire. How much money did German make today? $49.
[2392.44s -> 2415.14s]  Let me buy him my second Lamborghini. That's all right. Okay. Okay. Guys, the main
[2415.14s -> 2421.03s]  YouTube channel, I don't want to be completely transparent about the, okay. The main YouTube
[2421.03s -> 2443.83s]  channel makes about, uh, four to $500 a month. So no, it's not worth $112,000. It's more like
[2443.83s -> 2466.89s]  12,000 or like 8,000. What about the second channel? The second channel as of, as of like
[2467.61s -> 2476.28s]  this, I don't make, okay, listen, I'm going to be, let's be transparent here. So the second channel,
[2477.08s -> 2484.89s]  I do not have a majority revenue from. And as of bringing on potentially two or three more editors,
[2484.89s -> 2491.54s]  I am not taking a cent from the second channel. I don't, I don't receive any money from it. It's
[2491.54s -> 2498.66s]  going to be going out to the editors. I'm not going to take a dollar. Zero. As of, because otherwise
[2498.66s -> 2502.84s]  I wouldn't be able to, I wouldn't be able to afford to pay. You know, if we have like four or
[2502.84s -> 2507.58s]  five editors on that channel, I mean that that channel doesn't make enough money to support
[2508.22s -> 2515.66s]  like four people a month. So I've just, I'm just, that's just, I'm not going to take any money.
[2515.66s -> 2529.75s]  Why would I do that? But that the main, we're talking about the main channel. The main channel
[2529.75s -> 2543.24s]  doesn't like, you're not paying your redditors. You're wait, wait, wait, what? Yes. I don't,
[2543.88s -> 2550.12s]  the editors right now get a majority of the ad revenue from that channel. Yes. Wait, what? You
[2550.12s -> 2568.90s]  guys didn't think I was doing that? And real soon, my, my like cut from the second channel is going
[2568.90s -> 2576.63s]  to be zero. Absolute zero. I'm not going to take any money. I'm just going to, I need to, I need to
[2576.63s -> 2585.51s]  be able to be sustainable to have another two or three people on. It's paying his redditors.
[2586.15s -> 2602.41s]  What the fuck is this? Bench the bomber. I'm getting accused of things here. Net worth,
[2602.41s -> 2620.38s]  Forbes 100 list, Jeremy Albertson, $985 billion. All right. TLDW, too long, didn't watch.
[2628.52s -> 2637.00s]  Collecting crayons is the same thing as me buying gotcha force and stamps and shit and coins.
[2637.72s -> 2670.10s]  Too long, didn't watch. Stamps are cooler. No, they're not. You think a stamp is cooler
[2670.10s -> 2683.11s]  than gotcha force? No, they're not. Now I'm angry. All right, here we go. Here comes the gunner.
[2688.94s -> 2719.19s]  No, I caught, I was stuck to them. All right, here we go. $112,000. What's that? What are
[2719.19s -> 2726.42s]  they even calculating? How many subscribers the channel has? Gotcha force is an emulated
[2726.42s -> 2743.54s]  stamp collection. Thank you. Oh, mirror subs and views. How does like a subscribe to the
[2743.54s -> 2748.62s]  channel translate to how much money the channel is worth? Is that what somebody would, is that
[2748.62s -> 2752.94s]  what somebody would pay me right now to own that channel or something? Like if I sold it at auction,
[2752.94s -> 2774.02s]  would I be like, I want $112,000 for my website. One to five million, $112,000, $10 billion.
[2774.66s -> 2778.01s]  Ooh, I want this guy. This guy looks cool. Look at how cool this guy is.
[2787.29s -> 2799.03s]  It's the German 985 social media platform. But that's got to be like the biggest hilarious scam
[2799.03s -> 2808.10s]  ever to pull. Like, can you imagine? Like if all of my entire presence online,
[2808.10s -> 2814.95s]  right? Like say every channel, every post, every Twitter, everything, Twitch, everything. What do
[2814.95s -> 2818.55s]  you guys think would be worth? If I would be like, I'm selling it and I'm selling it to any company
[2818.55s -> 2832.58s]  that's willing to pay for it. Probably like 250,000, half a million. Half a million you think?
[2833.22s -> 2837.88s]  Okay, if somebody paid me half a million dollars for this, that would be the biggest joke ever.
[2837.88s -> 2844.60s]  Because the second that it became clear that the German 985 Twitter turned into Crest toothpaste,
[2846.31s -> 2851.99s]  you would all leave and no one would ever click anything. It would be the biggest scam ever.
[2852.71s -> 2867.03s]  Oh, the German 985 Twitch channel just became like A and B realty group. You would see the
[2867.03s -> 2872.63s]  most unsubscriptions from a channel in a one minute period ever in the history of this website.
[2878.34s -> 2883.18s]  And then the channel would be worth like 200 dollars that next year.
[2883.98s -> 2889.18s]  I would add that. So that would be like a 500,000 dollar just to give for free.
[2889.18s -> 2903.83s]  Just do that but make another channel. I just have a mustache. I don't want another normal night.
[2903.83s -> 2919.22s]  Normal night sucks. Just put a mustache on and just have a permanent voice changer
[2930.10s -> 2944.92s]  like this. Like that. Just like this forever. And speak with an accent. So I speak with an accent.
[2945.99s -> 2954.84s]  And people will think that this is a German. No, I don't know who that is. No.
[2964.41s -> 2968.26s]  Awful. It doesn't matter how awful it is. As long as I can be consistent with it.
[2972.17s -> 2976.30s]  Like for instance, thank you to Silent Serenity for the 250.
[2976.94s -> 2980.52s]  Hi, German. Now that you're running for public office, we're requesting that you release your
[2980.52s -> 2984.60s]  tax returns. Will we all unsubscribe if you don't release them within the month?
[2985.56s -> 2991.91s]  Uh, no, there's no reason. I don't have to do that. There's no reason why I'd have to do that.
[2991.91s -> 2995.99s]  Thanks for the 250 though. I would, if I did it for long enough. If I did it for long enough,
[2995.99s -> 3001.90s]  I would be able to fucking keep that up forever. It's a good idea. Not consistent. Yes, it was.
[3002.62s -> 3009.10s]  What accent do you think I'm doing? An accent. I don't know. Doesn't have to be anything.
[3009.82s -> 3021.93s]  It just can't be me talking like this. Do the Boston accent.
[3022.74s -> 3028.57s]  Hehehe. Just do Bernie for the rest of the stream. No, I'm not going to do that.
[3034.73s -> 3037.85s]  You know, you guys, you know, you guys are breaking the number one rule that every
[3037.85s -> 3043.69s]  friend is supposed to not break. Talking about money. How much money do you make?
[3044.41s -> 3059.99s]  Come on. I thought we were supposed to be friends. It's rude. Fucking rude. Hello.
[3078.12s -> 3083.96s]  Bench the bomber. Bench the bomber. Bench the bomber. Okay. All right. Thanks for the advice.
[3084.92s -> 3102.89s]  Oh, sorry. Thanks for the voice. Now, do I put in the dragon? I can't. I couldn't do it.
[3103.70s -> 3113.08s]  I can't. I can't do it. What's an accent I could do just forever? Um, I guess it could be something
[3113.08s -> 3120.31s]  like this, where I just add an inflection at the end of my sentences. I could do that probably.
[3120.95s -> 3129.35s]  I think so. I could do that one. That's the same voice. No, it's not. That's just changing my
[3129.35s -> 3143.29s]  cadences. That's you. I don't do that. Put the bomber. No, no. Okay. I got to play. What do I
[3143.29s -> 3158.38s]  want? All right. I'm going to do copy man. That's a YouTube documentary voice. Is it possible
[3159.02s -> 3168.74s]  that the Mayans had different technology? Could it be that astronauts have joined the Mayans?
[3169.46s -> 3176.78s]  Yeah, it kind of is. And then even when they're not asking a question, it's still a question.
[3179.72s -> 3188.39s]  Over 200 million Mayans existed in the year 14 AD. They're still asking a question.
[3189.11s -> 3201.48s]  You got to speak with confidence and with sincerity. That's a fat earther voice.
[3205.59s -> 3221.58s]  All right. What's next? This is the perfect guy for this, by the way. Oh, don't get killed.
[3221.58s -> 3235.94s]  Don't get killed. Fat fuck earth theory. Fat fuck earth theory. Space is incredibly large.
[3237.88s -> 3248.18s]  Scientists predict that over the next 200 years, Earth might spin at 2% faster than it does now.
[3249.99s -> 3261.96s]  Join me in this video as we see exactly how big the Earth can get. Audible.com is a website where
[3261.96s -> 3267.48s]  you can listen to music and TV shows on your computer. I'll probably spend the next probably
[3267.48s -> 3271.40s]  four or five minutes talking about this. Over the course of this 20 minute video,
[3271.40s -> 3280.74s]  we'll take a break to talk about it. And I know. But Earth is a gigantic place. But what if Earth
[3281.78s -> 3294.78s]  was 10 times larger? Scientists are calling this theory the fat fuck earth theory. We caught up.
[3295.50s -> 3316.22s]  Concentrating. Hold on. Don't want to die. I died. Dude, you gaming documentary videos.
[3322.46s -> 3358.18s]  Oh, dude, I'm hooked. This is a currency thing. This foot lettuce thing. Burger King. I can't. I'm
[3358.18s -> 3381.10s]  not going to say that out loud. You guys trying to drop my net worth? Crash his stock. I don't
[3381.10s -> 3389.69s]  have any. There's no such thing. There's no ticker for me. Guys, if there was a ticker for this
[3389.69s -> 3395.29s]  channel, all you memers would just manipulate the fuck out of it. And I would be under investigation
[3395.29s -> 3403.85s]  every day. The SEC would have me on speed dial. And I would have to talk to somebody every day.
[3405.61s -> 3409.21s]  The JR the turbo ticker has said more unusual activity.
[3411.54s -> 3414.34s]  I want to ask you a few questions about this. God damn it. Okay, what is it?
[3415.14s -> 3422.66s]  Well, it turns out they sold, then bought and then sold it again. $2 million worth of stock.
[3422.66s -> 3427.86s]  And it looks I see if you look at this chart. Looks like they spelled out the effort. Fuck
[3427.94s -> 3431.86s]  in the up and down sells and buys. Are you aware that you did you have anything to do with that?
[3433.13s -> 3436.57s]  No, I didn't. Actually, I didn't. How do I delist my can I go private again?
[3449.74s -> 3458.70s]  No, you can't actually. That'll be a $600,000 fine. I can't but my net worth is only 112.
[3459.98s -> 3485.91s]  Looks like you're fucked, kid. Oh, no, no. You already have one. Yeah, but that's just like
[3485.91s -> 3493.78s]  pretend goofy money. Every time you buy and sell on that website, all you do is somewhere
[3493.78s -> 3513.94s]  in the distance, you just hear like, oh, this is for fun. And it's cool. And that's a real I was
[3513.94s -> 3520.54s]  into that for a little while. I thought it was like a cool thing. This is like an interesting
[3520.54s -> 3527.13s]  little that's a that's a fun little project. But it's not, you know, it's not real money.
[3531.13s -> 3542.50s]  Derma podcast sucks. I wonder if it gets any and then idiot. Thanks for watching, everybody.
[3543.14s -> 3557.03s]  See you tomorrow audible.com. Let me see this if this gets any better. I don't want to listen to
[3557.03s -> 3578.47s]  that. Somebody sat on the clicker. Wikipedia the we encyclopedia that anyone can edit.
[3581.22s -> 3586.10s]  Why did you say it like that? Why did you say it like that? Why did you say it like that?
[3595.72s -> 3610.63s]  That's a meme. I don't know. All right, let's bring you you you copy man didn't get a chance.
[3612.68s -> 3649.34s]  We'll put copy man first. And that's what what Vito Vito just gave. Dude, you're up today. Oh,
[3650.30s -> 3674.54s]  we see. Oh, where? I'm not gonna say anything. I'm gonna just watch this.
[3697.74s -> 3706.30s]  It's crazy just how this reflects like actual looks like stock lines. It's always like a top.
[3707.10s -> 3712.62s]  There's I bet you if you did actual TA, like technique, if you did technical analysis,
[3712.62s -> 3716.78s]  like they did, like they don't stop tickers. You could find like bottoms,
[3716.78s -> 3726.60s]  you could find like, oh, that's a double bottom. That's what we call a, a, a, um, a, um,
[3728.04s -> 3733.64s]  ah, I might as well be doing technical analysis, because I can't up.
[3738.41s -> 3745.05s]  Yes, it's real. Oh, no, we hit the double top. Okay, I gotta I'll manipulate this. I can't look
[3745.05s -> 3785.43s]  at this. We love bottoms. Shut up. Wait, hold on a second. That's like, it's like,
[3785.51s -> 3789.35s]  holy shit. Elon Musk just tweeted he's made out of titanium.
[3790.39s -> 3795.54s]  And he'll live forever. Holy fuck. That's that kind of line.
[3817.98s -> 3821.98s]  Holy shit. That's the kind of line where it's like this just didn't McDonald's figured out how to
[3821.98s -> 3833.50s]  print money. Each person goes and gets a happy meal gets $100 and a happy meal. Holy shit.
[3844.52s -> 3848.12s]  Wait, why would they figure out how to do that? That's that's against the law.
[3848.92s -> 3858.07s]  Oh, no, no, no. It would be like this just did. Oh, all cars toys from 2000 to 2005
[3858.79s -> 3866.47s]  have appreciated in value by 200 million percent. Only the ones in the McDonald's toy box.
[3867.19s -> 3872.02s]  Wait, that wouldn't mean that they would that make McDonald's be? Yeah, because then people
[3872.02s -> 3880.57s]  be like, holy shit, I gotta buy McDonald's. Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it goes.
[3880.57s -> 3903.72s]  Let's make a camel. No, don't laugh at that. You're not done. OK, now I gotta say something
[3903.72s -> 3911.59s]  that's not funny, but that is funny at the same time for like the next 40 minutes.
[3929.08s -> 3951.22s]  Hey, no, no, no, no. Look at me. Giant enemy spider. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3953.74s -> 3959.05s]  Poopoo, poopoo, peepee, poopoo. I have a poopoo guy. Poopoo, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo.
[3965.90s -> 3969.02s]  That wasn't supposed to be funny. Stop buying.
[3974.10s -> 3980.66s]  What would happen? What would happen to the stock of like L.O.B.S.T. tweeted like peepee,
[3980.66s -> 3996.07s]  poopoo, poopoo, poopoo? Would it go up or down? It would probably go up. It would probably
[3996.07s -> 4004.34s]  explode in value. I don't know what the fuck that means, but I don't think I'm gonna buy it.
[4005.14s -> 4087.21s]  This is such a fun little thing. You ready? Hold on a second. Give me one second. Hold on.
[4087.21s -> 4094.57s]  No, no, no. I want to get it on screen. I'm not. I'm not doing what you think I'm doing. I promise.
[4112.50s -> 4132.73s]  Holy shit. OK, hold on. Let's keep this on for a little while. This is funny to me.
[4153.96s -> 4187.10s]  Oh, he's going to play. Quick sell. See? Oh, yeah, you got to see the time. OK, there we go.
[4187.10s -> 4210.39s]  All right, let's go. A little too big. So if you want to see why I thought this was a funny idea
[4210.39s -> 4215.26s]  at first and then I thought this was a really, really, really bad fucking idea. And I was going
[4215.26s -> 4222.68s]  to actually have somebody make an extension for this, like build out an extension that did this.
[4222.68s -> 4231.62s]  But you will see that it is now. It's it would be like we talked about this yesterday, didn't we?
[4231.62s -> 4234.74s]  I couldn't. It would be like it would be all I think about. I wouldn't be able to concentrate
[4234.74s -> 4299.08s]  on anything. Quick do a Shpee stimulus package. Oh, there was an estimate that there was going
[4299.08s -> 4306.25s]  to be a Shpee stimulus package and it didn't happen. Oh, shit. All the investors were expecting
[4306.25s -> 4323.18s]  it. It didn't happen. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. No, yeah, it's like it's it's 430.
[4323.90s -> 4345.75s]  We're waiting for a Shpee announcement here. What was going on? Investors, German 985 comedy
[4345.75s -> 4352.30s]  investors around the world are stuck right now. They don't know what to do. They were expecting
[4352.30s -> 4370.09s]  this and those that bought in very, very early back in 2011, they're still holding and they're
[4370.09s -> 4372.89s]  but they might start to sell. We're going to see some real capitulation here.
[4379.58s -> 4383.51s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're going to get we got a live feed from German 95
[4384.07s -> 4392.50s]  bedroom. Here he is. I slept in way too late. I slept in like way too late.
[4392.50s -> 4414.98s]  Investors around the world are weighing what they think about this. Is that too that may
[4414.98s -> 4433.37s]  have been too much stimulus? See how they feel about it. Trying that the the bulls are really
[4433.37s -> 4449.69s]  trying to take this up. Yeah, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna find out how to do this.
[4450.25s -> 4453.29s]  I'm gonna make like a comedy currency that's like built in with an extension
[4453.93s -> 4456.65s]  so people can like buy and sell comedy currency on this channel.
[4458.10s -> 4463.14s]  Even if it's only like active for like fucking a week. It'll only be live for like a week.
[4463.78s -> 4481.94s]  This is like funny. But this this is like insane. Do channel points. Oh my god.
[4484.28s -> 4489.77s]  Channel points. Okay. Yeah, we could do channel points. Channel points for like the IPO. Like
[4489.77s -> 4495.83s]  you have a bunch of them right now. You like got into the initial what? ICO. Initial Comedy.
[4495.83s -> 4503.35s]  I don't know. That's I don't want to use that. Initial Comedy Offering. No, I don't want to use
[4503.35s -> 4519.91s]  ICO. Don't want to do that. Hey guys, I'm making an ICO. That would be very bad. I don't I would
[4519.91s -> 4540.68s]  not want to say that one. Initial Comedy Offering. It's kind of like sad in a way. Last time you
[4540.68s -> 4546.60s]  heard somebody say that they were going to do an ICO. Holy shit. That's like 2016 2017.
[4547.48s -> 4578.79s]  I got to figure out how to do this because I think it'd be fun. They started right next to me.
[4578.79s -> 4598.78s]  I could have just put one of these guys in. Bugleberry is going to crash the market.
[4613.85s -> 4626.76s]  But I love Bugleberry. I think this could be fun for like a week. I have a pretend like
[4627.64s -> 4634.78s]  Twitch comedy traded channel points. That's built into that's baked into the channel.
[4635.50s -> 4642.87s]  And like people could buy and sell. And you could just lose a bunch of channel points and stuff.
[4642.87s -> 4655.66s]  We'll gain some. I have to be very clear. It's like I'm gonna be clear now about it to just
[4655.66s -> 4660.22s]  because I fucking have to say this and I'm going to say this. All of this is a comedy routine.
[4660.22s -> 4666.06s]  Like this is all a joke. It's a comedy routine. And nothing. It's not real value. It's just fake.
[4666.06s -> 4671.58s]  It's just fun. A little joke. That's not if it's real. You make sure I'm very clear about that.
[4677.83s -> 4693.67s]  What? I have to say that. This is a stock market parody without real value.
[4698.12s -> 4702.04s]  None of this is financial advice. It never was and it never will be.
[4702.76s -> 4713.16s]  Wait, are you guys selling because I'm telling you it's fake? Is that why?
[4714.60s -> 4722.60s]  No. CEO of German 95 Enterprises says that all of money in his stock is not even real.
[4726.87s -> 4734.09s]  It's not real money. CEO of major company says, sorry guys, I have to make this really clear.
[4734.09s -> 4747.93s]  Oh, the stock is worthless. It's not real. Holy shit, that would be insane.
[4754.65s -> 4760.17s]  And this would be funny for like a week. But that's all it could be there for. Because you know.
[4760.17s -> 4763.93s]  Because with everything, it doesn't even matter if it's not even real. There will be little groups
[4763.93s -> 4769.37s]  that like forming it like, all right, at 830 am, we're gonna dump it and then we're gonna
[4769.37s -> 4773.61s]  there'd be like discord calls about this. You know, it's gonna happen. But it'll be a little
[4773.61s -> 4806.84s]  experiment. It's already it's happening now. This is one of those charts where if you like
[4806.84s -> 4814.06s]  owned a stock in here, you it doesn't matter if it's like 8am or 8pm. You've probably opened
[4814.06s -> 4825.22s]  a bottle of whiskey. Holy shit. Oh my god. What the fuck? What do I do? This is fucked.
[4827.16s -> 4842.73s]  Try to like turn it off. Or do I do I buy it? Or do I sell it? I've gone up and down in
[4842.73s -> 4855.62s]  portfolio value 100% both directions in 10 minutes. Oh, I think I I think I'm gonna take a bath.
[4871.40s -> 4879.82s]  I think it went off the screen. Yeah. And then there's going to be the people that just want to
[4879.82s -> 4887.26s]  watch the world burn, right? And they're just going to sell and buy at the same price and just
[4887.98s -> 4903.96s]  manipulate it. So it goes up and down like a heart monitor. No matter what. Oh, shit, I'm gonna lose.
[4910.95s -> 4916.07s]  Okay, I'd have to put some like, some like rules in. And maybe you could only do a certain amount
[4916.07s -> 4932.33s]  of like a certain amount a day or a stream. I don't know. Oh, I also have to put this on
[4932.33s -> 4937.26s]  screen too. This is hold on. I don't want people to think that like if they just come in right now
[4937.26s -> 5002.68s]  and it's like, well, what stock is this? You know what I mean? Like I got to hold on. Oh, shit.
[5003.24s -> 5045.82s]  Oh my god. I'm kind of Oh, I just lost right there. Hold on. Did I lose it? Did I win the loss? It's
[5045.82s -> 5049.66s]  not supposed to be funny. That's not supposed to be funny. That's I don't want people to come in
[5049.66s -> 5055.72s]  here and be like, what the fuck are they doing? You know what I mean? Like it went up and it went
[5055.72s -> 5063.35s]  down and then it went up and it went down. No, no, no, no, no. Like this is very clear that we're
[5063.35s -> 5071.26s]  just this is a this is a fake my streams comedy ticker. Somebody's gave $50.
[5081.18s -> 5089.24s]  Kajtech thanks for the 5000 bits. $50. Dermot, I have to inform you as a lawyer that this concept
[5089.24s -> 5094.44s]  already exists. It's twitch stocks. I'll be forced to minus two your stream if you do not cease and
[5094.44s -> 5100.79s]  desist. Well, no, I'm we're doing we're talking about comedy points. This is not a stock. This
[5100.79s -> 5107.11s]  is a comedy point. I'm a comedy point. Don't call it a ticker. This is a comedy point.
[5118.57s -> 5122.17s]  I almost turned on the webcam and I don't have a shirt on. I was going to be that would have been
[5122.17s -> 5126.81s]  like buy or sell. I don't know that would have moved. That would have moved the comedy points
[5126.81s -> 5145.85s]  a lot in some direction. I almost did it. It was close. Yeah, I got to get okay. I don't like copy
[5145.85s -> 5165.19s]  manners. Oh, who can I fit? Man, man, girl. And we have come on, Gwen. I like it. I like this new
[5165.19s -> 5200.73s]  group. You have to show it now or we're going to dump your comedy point. I'm not going to be naked
[5200.73s -> 5210.25s]  on camera. Yes, if you want to if you want to dump my fake comedy points, which doesn't affect me,
[5212.79s -> 5218.97s]  where being like naked on stream ends my career. And then this channel really won't be worth
[5218.97s -> 5227.32s]  anything. And then that that little net worth thing that you that you linked that goes zero.
[5240.86s -> 5243.26s]  I am going to figure out how to get that to work though. I think that's funny.
[5256.23s -> 5296.23s]  You guys are going off the screen. Oh my god. I fucking hate clicking on shit. Stop.
[5298.33s -> 5309.24s]  I don't think that's effective. CEO of comedy company sees comedy points drop by 80% in one
[5309.24s -> 5338.82s]  hour tweets stop. Shocked that it didn't work. How do I get this guy, this bird guy? He's so fast.
[5339.38s -> 5361.21s]  Take him out. Take him out. Take him out. Take him out. We still want face cam. No,
[5361.21s -> 5381.19s]  I'm not turning on face cam. I love this. You know, it's really funny. I love watching the
[5381.19s -> 5417.67s]  people type in minus five. It don't work like that. Sorry. What happened here? I woke up
[5419.19s -> 5431.14s]  in the morning and I saw I just looked at the chart. What's the news? Oh, CEO, CEO tweeted out
[5431.94s -> 5438.98s]  picture of asshole with two middle fingers on it and said fuck all investors.
[5440.31s -> 5443.59s]  Oh, holy shit. That's the only way this would have happened.
[5449.02s -> 5476.38s]  This is not natural. Are you buying that? You shouldn't be purchasing that. Oh, I got one.
[5476.38s -> 5502.97s]  Finally, acceleration ninja. Oh, imagine buying it up. I don't care. I give a shit if I see the
[5502.97s -> 5511.34s]  guy's asshole. The company's still worth $6.7 billion. What's wrong with you guys? Who cares?
[5527.42s -> 5533.18s]  CEO tweets picture of asshole with middle fingers and says fuck you to all investors.
[5534.87s -> 5541.11s]  And then two minutes later does another tweet shaking hands with two to three scientists
[5541.11s -> 5571.19s]  and doctors saying he has the cure for every illness on earth. Holy fuck. Quick. And then
[5571.19s -> 5577.91s]  the people, the people that bought like two hours ago that took a shit and came back when it's back
[5577.91s -> 5589.61s]  to normal are just like, I'm so glad I had diarrhea. I'm so glad. Holy shit. I was so I
[5589.61s -> 5596.26s]  was cursing the toilet and oh my god, I'm so glad I didn't look at this. Thank you. Thank you.
[5596.26s -> 5658.89s]  Based diarrhea. You're gross. Back to where it was when you bought it. Derma comedy. JCP now worth
[5658.89s -> 5702.49s]  more than oh my god. What the fuck? Activate. Activate. Activate. Derma's got a monopoly in
[5702.49s -> 5710.10s]  the Derma comedy point on comedy points. Yeah, the antitrust got involved. He's got to shout
[5710.10s -> 5718.41s]  out three YouTubers a week now. Yeah, that was the rolling. That was the rolling from the pretend
[5719.21s -> 5743.75s]  exchange people. Okay, you guys understand that this has to be complete comedy and complete
[5743.75s -> 5770.01s]  fabrication. When do you get one of these drill tanks? I want one of these things.
[5770.73s -> 5806.30s]  I mean, I'm worth five billion. I can get one. Come on. Come on, girl. Come on. Nice shot. Good
[5806.30s -> 5812.30s]  shot. Good shot. Be funny. What? I can't look. I can't pay. This is why it's only going to be
[5812.30s -> 5817.98s]  around for a week if I do it. It's I'll never I'll have to be like, what is that? What is that?
[5817.98s -> 5831.37s]  What is that? What is that? Is she the last one? No, who's left? Oh, shit. Okay, I gotta be careful.
[5839.59s -> 5850.36s]  Oh, oh, he just slam dunked me out of nowhere. Oh, fuck. Bad. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5850.36s -> 5873.83s]  Yes. Thank God. Big Mitz. Big Mitz. Oh, you're right. It's $50 from ACDC freak. Thanks for the
[5874.39s -> 5881.27s]  five. Finally, a tank. Thanks for the 50 bucks. 5000 bits. Thank you so much for all the laughs
[5881.27s -> 5884.47s]  you've given me over the years. You helped me through so much, especially during these really
[5884.47s -> 5888.31s]  hard times. Thank you again for all you do. Thanks for the fucking incredibly kind message. And thanks
[5888.31s -> 5902.07s]  for the huge amount of money. It's just 50 bucks, like $50. Thank you. Finally, a drill tank. Give
[5902.07s -> 5914.36s]  me two of those. Finally, a drill tank. All right. Hold on a minute here. One of these revolver
[5914.36s -> 5925.50s]  gunmen have a blue shirt on. Yeah. Why do you have a blue shirt on? What's the difference?
[5938.68s -> 5946.28s]  What? It's just a different color. Oh, all right. Time to clean this up. All right. To the warehouse.
[5948.86s -> 5964.74s]  I'm not ever going to use you to the warehouse. You are new though. Samurai. Oh, rolling slash.
[5964.74s -> 5975.61s]  I'll get, I'll try them. We have too many of these revolvers. Warehouse. Warehouse.
[5978.14s -> 5985.91s]  Somebody, what is it? Yeah. You're level three. Warehouse. You can stay. I don't,
[5985.91s -> 5993.02s]  wire girl. No, no, no. I don't know. Probably not going to use wire girl. I got to clean this up.
[5993.02s -> 5995.98s]  I got to get rid of that. I told you, look at the title. I got to get rid of my fucking toys.
[5996.78s -> 6004.14s]  I'm not going to use spinner girl. Go over here. I might need you eventually.
[6004.86s -> 6016.71s]  I want to try the tank and I want to try the, what's acceleration ninja speed type, mid air,
[6017.67s -> 6023.51s]  kamaitachi, kamaitachi, and then ninpo full throttle. Oh, he's got wheels. This guy's cool.
[6024.39s -> 6030.34s]  The fastest gachaborg in the assassination unit. The amazing speed of his ninpo full throttle
[6030.34s -> 6038.33s]  sends any enemy that bumps into him flying. Cool. I mean, they're new. I have to try them.
[6038.89s -> 6054.78s]  Here we go. Yeah. What animal cleaning I need to do? Yeah. I'll do it later. I'll do it later. I'll
[6054.94s -> 6060.14s]  do it later. I'll do it later. I see. I do that so often. How many of you guys start cleaning your
[6060.14s -> 6066.41s]  room and you see just how much shit you have to do. You pick up like three pieces of paper
[6066.41s -> 6072.20s]  and wipe just the area you can see with your eyes. And then you go, fuck, there's so much.
[6073.32s -> 6079.05s]  That was a good start. And then it doesn't happen again until you need to clean the room again.
[6079.77s -> 6089.38s]  It happens all the time to me. Plus two better than nothing.
[6090.10s -> 6101.94s]  I don't want to do the boss battle. I want to do this. I don't know if I like these new units.
[6101.94s -> 6117.05s]  As a homeowner, I know what you mean. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Let's check the samurai.
[6123.91s -> 6148.06s]  He is fast, isn't he? He is fast. He's fast. He's fire. Think fire. Think fire. Think fire.
[6148.06s -> 6151.10s]  But why am I getting minus two? Because you guys don't know what the fuck that is.
[6151.10s -> 6160.20s]  Not even Kingdom Hearts fans. Holy shit. Holy shit. Not even Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 fans.
[6164.02s -> 6172.58s]  I mean, Kingdom Hearts 3. But the first two. Those were good. Weren't they?
[6185.88s -> 6190.71s]  Wait a minute. That was my favorite game. Minus two. Minus two. Minus two. Minus two. Minus three.
[6190.71s -> 6194.87s]  Minus three. Minus three. Minus two. Minus three. I'm going to do minus three because I love
[6194.87s -> 6216.87s]  Kingdom Hearts 3. Minus two. Minus three. In the middle of all this, somebody just writes,
[6217.67s -> 6235.22s]  dude, chill. You're right. I'll chill. You're right. This guy's good. He's a little beefier
[6235.22s -> 6266.79s]  than the other one. The tank. Actually pretty good. Really, really beefy too. It's got to be,
[6266.79s -> 6272.23s]  you got to hit. This would be really good against big units. I can't really dodge that well. That's
[6272.23s -> 6279.80s]  actually really good. Nice. I love it. It has a lot of health. Oh yeah. I guess, no, it can jump.
[6279.80s -> 6292.06s]  All right. That's cool. Lay an egg on screen. So you want me to go get like a comedy egg
[6292.62s -> 6296.71s]  and for like two or three months, make you really aware that I'm sitting on it.
[6299.48s -> 6315.91s]  And then after like a month or two, have it hatch on screen. And I play the Jurassic Park.
[6317.03s -> 6329.85s]  Look at how cute that is music. And then the thing attaches to my face. It's just biting me
[6329.85s -> 6333.61s]  and I like destroy the room because it's latching on. I won't let go. And it's like killing me and
[6333.61s -> 6349.93s]  hurting me in this free man. Like an alien face hugger is just like, Oh, look at how cute it is.
[6355.02s -> 6360.22s]  Oh, wow. Look at him. Come on. Come on. And I'm like, Oh my God.
[6360.62s -> 6365.66s]  Please. I'm like running around like bumping into walls and shit about the thing. Like is
[6365.66s -> 6383.19s]  feeding off of my blood. It's like a three week break. And I just got, I come back wearing a
[6383.19s -> 6395.72s]  neck brace. Like he clearly is like biting me on the shoulder, like on like the arm.
[6396.52s -> 6407.06s]  And I come back with a neck brace on. That's pretty good. I think, I think that would be fun.
[6407.86s -> 6413.00s]  You spoiled the whole joke. Yeah. You'll forget when it happens in like six months.
[6413.88s -> 6426.26s]  Showdown to the death base. Put a dog cone on. I keep, I keep like trying to like put my head
[6426.26s -> 6433.34s]  over and like lick. I'm just like, God damn it. Oh, I just want to come on. That's pretty good.
[6434.14s -> 6443.16s]  I'll see you in six months when this happens. I put my foot up and like try to get under and
[6443.16s -> 6457.03s]  like get it off by like scratching underneath. Like my foot comes up and have like big fake
[6457.03s -> 6460.47s]  dog feet made. So like, I can just have like a little bar that I pull up and it's a big dog
[6460.47s -> 6485.22s]  foot and I'm going to scratch under. All right. Oh shit. This is a real battle. Wait, having dog
[6485.22s -> 6490.50s]  feet is too far, but having an alien creature that hatches out of an egg latches onto my face
[6490.50s -> 6509.35s]  and is killing me. It's not too far. I must make, make sure I'm clear on this. Okay. Oh, it's this,
[6509.35s -> 6513.75s]  this is the hardest enemy in the whole game. I hate these guys. It's so, they have so much health.
[6513.75s -> 6532.38s]  They're so strong. They can move so quickly. They have to think. Look at that axe. I was trying to
[6532.38s -> 6549.16s]  go in whatever tank time. It's a good hit. Even if I have to trade here, it's fine. This is his best
[6549.16s -> 6556.84s]  unit. Speaking of, Oh yeah, this is done. Nice. Look at that. Look at the GF go down. Another one
[6557.88s -> 6566.70s]  except it's, she's come on. Okay. It's all right. It's all right. Who's next. I don't have play with
[6566.70s -> 6585.59s]  this guy. Oh my God. Where is he? Holy shit. This guy's insane. He's too good. I don't know how to
[6585.59s -> 6614.52s]  use them. Stop. Stop. Stop it. I love the way he skates around too. What is this charge? It's so
[6614.52s -> 6633.30s]  long. Oh, it's just a big AOE. Come on, block it. Come on. You don't even know how to use that.
[6633.30s -> 6672.10s]  What? Juggle. Juggle. I think who's next. Thank you. So you beat me. Vito, I'll give you this.
[6672.10s -> 6679.10s]  This belonged to my father. When you have three of them, the gate will open. I got three. I've got
[6679.10s -> 6710.60s]  three. Why did his father have a death crystal? I don't know. Beat the deadly UFOs. I like this
[6710.60s -> 6746.76s]  team. Stop making fun of kids. Not a bad graph. We're doing all right. Can I get on top of that?
[6749.19s -> 6762.87s]  Oh, probably should have picked somebody that has better long range capabilities. I don't know why
[6762.87s -> 6791.56s]  this is in my head. Why is this in my head? Destroy. Destroy. Why is it in my head? Imagine
[6791.56s -> 6823.53s]  not playing Star Fox 64. Yeah, I know. This thing is better than Spikehead. You were like 23 when
[6823.53s -> 6836.36s]  this game came out. How old do you think I am? 23? How old do you think I am? Honestly, this game
[6836.36s -> 6861.96s]  came out in 2003. How old is he now? 28. The death gate has opened. Nice. I need the dream team here.
[6862.68s -> 6888.28s]  Save the game. It's been like a year. I was like 17. Do the math. 85 to 2003. I was like 17. Let's
[6888.28s -> 6912.18s]  see. 85 plus 10 is 95. 85. 95 plus 10 is 100. 2005. So subtract three years. I was 17 years old,
[6912.18s -> 6931.02s]  not 23. My God. Getting rid of you. Let's get Spikehead. He's just very efficient.
[6931.74s -> 6937.00s]  Well, I need efficient. You are probably going to be good here because you've just been spam.
[6938.70s -> 6945.29s]  You'll be good here. We got 300 more points. Basically the same thing. This is not the same
[6945.29s -> 6962.31s]  thing. Why is he so mad all the time? Because I don't even have blood. It's just liquid
[6962.31s -> 6976.89s]  fucking gas. It's like a hot burning liquid. I have lava for blood. Let's see. Liquid water.
[6976.89s -> 6989.94s]  He's got Mountain Dew for blood. This last slot is important. Who do I want on the plane maybe?
[6990.58s -> 7001.42s]  Yeah. This plane's good. He's got code red in his blood. The decisive battle. Defeat the Cosmic
[7001.42s -> 7009.93s]  Dragon. This must be the death gate to the Death Fortress. This place is going to be your grave.
[7010.57s -> 7015.99s]  You wish. Let's go. Defeat the Cosmic Dragon. Who do we need for this one?
[7019.46s -> 7049.74s]  Heavy hitters like Tsutomu. Is it the Ender Dragon? Fire. You missed.
[7050.46s -> 7065.37s]  Oh. Why is it bouncing off? Oh, he's got that portal. Holy shit. He's dead. I'm going to kill
[7065.37s -> 7076.98s]  a dragon with this one guy. He's dead. There's more than one dragon. This game. I think it sucks.
[7083.46s -> 7104.55s]  No. Stop. Turn the fan off. Turn the fan off. Kill. Pissing into the wind. Is there any more
[7104.55s -> 7126.87s]  Ender Dragons? No. Point blank. Got it. Point blank. Uh oh. This is bad. This is bad. This is
[7126.87s -> 7145.83s]  bad. Bad. Bad. Good thing I got this guy. Okay. One more. Oh. Get back over there and hit him in the
[7145.83s -> 7178.57s]  head. Oh my. How many more fucking guys do you have? Here we go. That's his last guy. Got it.
[7178.57s -> 7192.79s]  What do you have left? What the fuck? This is not fair. Back up. Where the fuck is my friend?
[7192.79s -> 7202.31s]  Where's my head? Give me that. What do you have left? This is ridiculous. That's the Ender Dragon.
[7202.31s -> 7222.22s]  Okay. This is the Ender Dragon. What's that mean? I got to get my head. Oh. Oh. Don't. Oh. That hurt.
[7224.30s -> 7247.75s]  No. No. We need that power up. Oh, who's left? All right. Sniper Girl. Is anybody apt to Sniper
[7247.75s -> 7254.23s]  Girl or is this it? Oh, underneath. Go underneath. Underneath. Underneath. Underneath. Underneath.
[7254.23s -> 7276.70s]  Underneath. Get out from under there. Yes. That was a secret mission, by the way. I definitely got
[7276.70s -> 7286.04s]  something cool. But, uh, I had a plan after that. Nice. I thought that was my last character.
[7289.70s -> 7316.28s]  Oh, hell yeah. Oh, yeah. Elemental Knight and a Thanatos. 100 energy. My headaches.
[7316.84s -> 7325.80s]  What am I doing? You fool. Galactic Emperor. You can't stop me. The time draws near.
[7337.59s -> 7347.14s]  That's the haunted house when you're like eight and one of the lunch ladies at your school is
[7348.12s -> 7359.11s]  behind the microphone doing a scary voice. What happened? All right. I made that joke. Do it again.
[7359.67s -> 7371.10s]  What's going on? Made that exact joke before. Twice. Guys, I've said every word in the dictionary
[7371.10s -> 7377.88s]  at this point, so I might repeat a joke or two once every like three years. Sorry. Grownups have
[7377.88s -> 7382.10s]  finally noticed the Death Force, but they don't know what to do. What? Of course, they have no
[7382.10s -> 7390.26s]  idea what we are dealing with. Right. Only Gachaborgs can defeat Gachaborgs. Um, I think
[7390.26s -> 7393.38s]  if you just, if you were an adult and you picked up one of these toys and snapped it in half,
[7393.38s -> 7417.77s]  that would work. Let's split up and take them on separately. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Elemental
[7417.77s -> 7427.03s]  Knight. Elemental Punch. Elemental Sword. And Elemental Slash. This strange Gachaborg's armor
[7427.03s -> 7432.71s]  is empty. And as life force appears to be contained in his sword, his elemental sword was forged to
[7432.71s -> 7446.86s]  destroy a legendary ancient knight. Hope you're not bad. Okay. I like this. I'm gonna do Elemental
[7446.86s -> 7470.36s]  Knight. Listen, Vito, you gotta help me. To the warehouse? No. Does Elemental Knight have a sword?
[7470.92s -> 7480.70s]  What just happened? I just died. What happened? Why did he explode? He's, oh, I got a defective
[7480.70s -> 7500.97s]  one. He's broken. I have to return it. He's cool. I got a broken one. Okay.
[7501.85s -> 7511.56s]  Uh, well, command girl, just fly away. Just get the hell away. Get the hell away. Just get the hell
[7511.56s -> 7529.45s]  away. Get the hell out of here. I just out ran it. Plane! Come on, plane clutch, plane clutch,
[7529.45s -> 7537.18s]  plane clutch, plane clutch, plane clutch, plane clutch. They all crashed into each other. That
[7537.18s -> 7571.26s]  was perfect. Sunnyside Park is safe. Good. No, I need to save it. Yeah. Let's do this one. These
[7571.26s -> 7581.54s]  ones are the important ones, right? You're late. I want to see, I want to play with the knight.
[7582.34s -> 7603.34s]  Here we go. Okay. Dude, he's got some good, he's got a cool combo. What's the other one do? What?
[7603.34s -> 7615.53s]  Okay. What is that? He explodes. Oh, he formed. Am I not targetable when that happens? That's
[7615.53s -> 7624.26s]  actually pretty great. Oh, you shoot your hand out. It's like a rocket punch. Do not target.
[7624.26s -> 7659.14s]  Holy shit. This guy's awesome. I'm kicking the shit out of this guy. Rocket punch. Wow.
[7660.89s -> 7665.61s]  He's so powerful with the power. When you get the superpower, he's so good.
[7666.41s -> 7682.39s]  When you're juggling them around, come on. What happened? Somebody said, oh my god, the minus two
[7682.39s -> 7696.87s]  and plus two grab. Yeah, this is bullshit going on earlier. It's all right. That punch is really
[7696.87s -> 7727.67s]  effective too. This is really good. I haven't even had to change characters and wham. Crash, crash,
[7727.67s -> 7753.03s]  crash. There's no reason to. This guy's dodging me. Don't like it. Dude, I just did half his health in
[7753.03s -> 7767.37s]  one hit. Bang. Oh, you know, you're a streamer. Cool stuff going on on the screen. You haven't
[7767.37s -> 7787.61s]  said anything in a while. Bang. Bang. Right there. Nice. Streaming tips. The German 985. Nice. Bang.
[7788.25s -> 7795.08s]  Great turn on the face cam. No, I'm not going to turn on the face cam. How many bullets? What the
[7795.08s -> 7817.98s]  fuck? This game is so good. Everything's not about face cam. Okay. Good shot. That was a long range.
[7817.98s -> 7833.88s]  That was a blue plate special. Do another one. Oh, I just missed it. Back, back, back. No. No.
[7833.88s -> 7855.14s]  Give me the head. No. Top of the top of your head. Let's punch him. What? What's going on here?
[7856.44s -> 7880.66s]  Hey. No face cam. Oh my god. A chainsaw knight. These guys have kicked the shit out of me through
[7880.66s -> 7897.74s]  the whole game and now I got one. What is that? A lance knight? I could have it. Holy fuck. We're
[7897.74s -> 7917.00s]  getting a lot of stuff. Come on. Is it two of them? Is that it? Did I get lucky? Where's the
[7917.00s -> 7926.89s]  chainsaw knight? There you are. Huge damage. No weapon. Just has wire arm and chainsword.
[7927.70s -> 7932.98s]  Chainsaw Knight is a breakaway soldier from the Knightborg Corps. He wields a huge chainsword
[7932.98s -> 7937.38s]  and can slash anything to pieces. Grab enemies with the wire arm and then slash them with the
[7937.46s -> 7949.02s]  sword. Nice. All right. We're going to have to... What's more important? Plane's going to have...
[7950.55s -> 7954.63s]  Sorry, command girl. I know you're level three and you're one of the best characters that I have,
[7954.63s -> 7976.94s]  but I'm sorry. I need to try a chainsaw guy. Everybody's selling. Sell. I didn't save it.
[7978.57s -> 7988.82s]  No, my life savings. The plane's mediocre. Yeah, but it's really good to maneuver around.
[8005.69s -> 8014.39s]  Wait, is this like having a movie on in the back seat? The graph is having a movie on in
[8014.39s -> 8022.23s]  the back seat of a car? What do you mean? Don't hurt me. Defeat enemy, got you more.
[8028.07s -> 8033.45s]  It's distracting. That's what I mean. That's why if I do this, I only want to do this for like a week
[8034.25s -> 8061.54s]  and have it be real for a little bit. Can I pull the whole ship? Kind of. This guy wasn't really
[8061.54s -> 8083.70s]  made for this, was he? Okay. That was not a good representation of what he does. Fire, fire, fire,
[8083.70s -> 8104.30s]  fire, fire, fire. Missiles. Missiles. Oh, that's not good. All right. Tank versus tank. Jesus.
[8105.02s -> 8123.51s]  What is even firing at me? Doing a lot of damage, but what are you? What are you? I can't move.
[8123.99s -> 8144.33s]  I'm stuck. I have a debuff. Here we go. Melee. Not a good choice. Yeah, not a good choice.
[8145.29s -> 8152.68s]  Melee was not the right thing to do. We need long range shooters. We need.
[8157.18s -> 8183.19s]  Oh, here's the last resort here. Holy shit, it worked. Give me a hat. Give me one of these hats.
[8183.99s -> 8197.74s]  Did I get it? I got him. One more hit and he's dead. I need a hat. Where's one of my hats?
[8198.46s -> 8210.65s]  Just avoid him. He'll be killed by this ship. Ship friend will take care of him. Good. Already
[8210.65s -> 8220.12s]  back down again. Guys, this shit used to happen to Bitcoin every day for like three months.
[8222.94s -> 8234.52s]  You guys just pretending to be the BTC chart from like early 2018. Like somewhere in like the mid
[8234.52s -> 8251.93s]  2018. This shit happened like every day. It was, it was infuriating. GT area is safe. Oh,
[8251.93s -> 8265.86s]  oh no. Don't get your ice cream on me. He's a crypto trader Redditor. I'm going to,
[8265.86s -> 8275.34s]  I want to keep the melee. I like this team. Cooperate with Kakarou to retake Serenity Street.
[8281.70s -> 8308.25s]  There's no reason for this. There's no reason for this. It's because of the face cam. I mean,
[8308.25s -> 8315.27s]  he's all right. How did I miss all those? What the fuck? How did I miss them all?
[8321.72s -> 8332.01s]  This is pretty good actually. You can land it. How did you dodge all those?
[8344.36s -> 8371.64s]  Got him. Is that my ally? This will be good. Big thick beams. There they go.
[8382.70s -> 8410.89s]  It can't go any lower. It can't go any lower. I don't have clothes on. I can't. What do you
[8410.89s -> 8437.94s]  guys not know about terms of service? You're not allowed to be naked. Don't let him come over here.
[8437.94s -> 8468.04s]  Shoot him. No, I did it. You were there. Good shot. Sack. Sack. Sack. The guy didn't stand a
[8468.04s -> 8503.56s]  chance. This tank is so good. He's left. Tank is so good. We're at all time lows here. Shit. Got it.
[8504.74s -> 8526.55s]  No. Okay. I've had enough of your bullshit. Let's get found. Fucking melee. Fucking melee is not
[8526.55s -> 8548.54s]  working here. There's just missiles surrounding me. Where am I? Dead. I'm dead too. Pick it up.
[8548.54s -> 8564.87s]  Where is it? Get it. Did I not hit you? Get the hell out of here. Big guy. Probably one of the
[8564.87s -> 8575.34s]  last things left. Damn it. Just enough. I just need a little bit more and I can throw as many
[8575.34s -> 8593.66s]  as I want. We're going off the chart. Oh shit. Careful. What does that mean? What is that?
[8594.30s -> 8620.81s]  Who cares? Don't get scared. Just kill him. I need my helmet. Give me one. No.
[8633.13s -> 8679.54s]  You fucking asshole. Do something. Do something. Help me. All right. No, no. Don't turn it on yet.
[8683.02s -> 8817.74s]  I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. What do we got? Okay.
[8818.30s -> 8937.83s]  Okay. Base cam. Sell. No, we don't. Buy it. I think it's broken. I think. Hello. I think
[8937.83s -> 9006.58s]  my pretend funny stock tag is broken. Hold on. Let me reload it. Here we go. Let's play. Crystal.
[9006.58s -> 9018.44s]  What's in the crystal? Ooh. That's the guy that shoots the huge beam. Plus two. Dunky donut.
[9020.17s -> 9037.46s]  All right. Another data crystal. What is it? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. You
[9037.46s -> 9043.85s]  know when your hair is so bad that this is solid. I was trying to run my hands through my hair.
[9043.85s -> 9056.98s]  I tried. What the fuck? I can't. It hurts. Look at how much there is in just the worst places.
[9057.96s -> 9065.34s]  This hair just in places that it shouldn't be. It's just everywhere. Like it's all back here.
[9065.34s -> 9095.19s]  It's just all back there. Get a haircut, please. I can't.
[9097.27s -> 9103.99s]  Do you? Um, excuse me. Are you? Do you? Wait. I can't really. I can't go anywhere.
[9104.55s -> 9114.33s]  Do it yourself. I'll mess it up. Could it look any worse than this though? I don't know.
[9118.97s -> 9132.04s]  Just shave it. What if I just do like a big fucking big ponytail up here? No,
[9132.04s -> 9136.92s]  I can't even do a ponytail. It's too long back here. And it's too short up here.
[9144.44s -> 9179.32s]  How would that look? It's so funny how you can go from. Oh, check me out. Just look at it.
[9180.44s -> 9187.78s]  I have like a second head that's back here. If I would have like moved this.
[9189.35s -> 9192.87s]  I have so much mass back here that there's probably like a face that's just like
[9194.23s -> 9198.55s]  sticking out its mouth and its eyes and shit. Like I'm hiding another like head under here.
[9203.98s -> 9210.20s]  Too much hair in the back. That's. Don't do spoilers for movies and TV shows, please.
[9215.50s -> 9219.99s]  I know. Look, this is the worst I'm ever going to look. So who cares? All right. This is like
[9219.99s -> 9241.85s]  the worst I will look. By the way, Darth Vader playing a fucking piano. All right. Goodbye.
[9242.41s -> 9255.29s]  All right. We have recovered. Thanks for having fun. Hey Vito, our town is a total mess.
[9255.93s -> 9266.34s]  Did somebody say I wonder what his hair smells like? Or am I just making that up because I saw
[9266.34s -> 9284.28s]  I wonder what his hair and then adding the rest. I'll squash all you bug. No, I said that. I know
[9284.28s -> 9291.69s]  that's what I'm saying. One got it. Ooh. And they even got a new camp. Oh, fixed cameras,
[9291.69s -> 9310.52s]  fixed camera and go stupid. This character is actually really good. Why are you getting
[9310.52s -> 9321.06s]  this close to me? You know what my skill set is. Okay. I tried it a lot. I have a plane.
[9325.13s -> 9341.98s]  Holy shit. I just instantly died. Oh, it's because these tanks got to go. Oh, man. Shit.
[9342.70s -> 9363.90s]  I got to get in there to that tank. He's going to just do that super beam and pull up and pull
[9363.90s -> 9376.52s]  them in and pull them in and get them in. It does a lot of damage if I can hit the damn thing.
[9377.32s -> 9417.83s]  Yeah, I agree. He's annoying, annoying brat. Holy shit. That went far. That's him. You're hitting
[9417.83s -> 9423.75s]  me. It's hitting me. He's so dumb. I don't want to be on the same team as him anymore.
[9424.39s -> 9453.98s]  All right. Let's clean this up. Please clean it up. You could please. Who's left? See you later.
[9458.89s -> 9482.07s]  Making noises. Hey, it's me. I have turbo. I do noise. Can I please run away? Handling. Don't
[9482.07s -> 9505.32s]  fall for it. It was a one hit kill. This character is I think probably the most consistently just
[9505.32s -> 9513.32s]  good. It's just so good at everything. That's why him and I click so well together. You know?
[9527.67s -> 9554.23s]  Come on. Really? This chart turned the face cam off all of a sudden. Oh, we got. I want another
[9554.23s -> 9571.40s]  command girl. This is like the fourth spinner girl. Ask and you shall receive another one.
[9580.44s -> 9600.31s]  Yes. Well, I'm the coolest. You're such a loser. You are such a loser. I want to try this new tank.
[9601.03s -> 9616.23s]  Okay. Now, um, I want to command girls. I'm over by a lot. You're cool, but you've got to go
[9619.02s -> 9628.82s]  over by 150. What was my level three? Okay. You go first by 180. Do I have anybody that's 180?
[9631.69s -> 9646.81s]  No, I don't. I think one cooperate with the UG to retake the pit. Where are they? Wait,
[9646.81s -> 9653.88s]  didn't they say? Where are the adults? Didn't they say the adults were here now? Where are the adults?
[9660.89s -> 9672.71s]  They're dead. Huh? Yeah. Keep that shit over there. I don't want to get out of here with that.
[9672.71s -> 9693.90s]  I hate when they kept you in that junk. That was a nice shot. Oh, you got keen on what I was doing.
[9702.44s -> 9710.76s]  5300 points. Holy. Come on, man. A lot. My crew is only worth like a thousand or like 1800.
[9717.18s -> 9721.21s]  What was that? Did we just get like, did we just get a?
[9726.14s -> 9740.52s]  What was it? Is it? Is it? Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I'll get it. What's the one that goes, um,
[9743.24s -> 9748.39s]  how does that one go? Can I give it to me phonetically?
[9757.37s -> 9766.94s]  Some, that's some, that's some, my cake, that's some, that's a mock, that's a mock,
[9766.94s -> 9779.30s]  kicks up. What is it? That's my thoughts, I think. He's trying. I, when I say it, when I go,
[9779.30s -> 9784.98s]  let's start to, to look at that sounds more than when it's touch my spin, but it can, I can't say
[9784.98s -> 9809.99s]  it. Say it. Atsuma, NA education. Sorry. I didn't learn Japanese. Is it Japanese? I'm just going to
[9809.99s -> 9829.27s]  hold on. Ken spin move. Tatsu, Tatsumaki, Tatsumaki, the Tatsumaki. What is the Rio spinning
[9829.27s -> 9855.50s]  kit called? Sen, Senpu, Senpuku, Atsumaki Senpuyo. I can't hold on. I need to, I gotta hear it.
[9860.06s -> 9867.90s]  To me, it's in my head. Cannon. It's that. Let's see it.
[9877.13s -> 9878.17s]  That's tight. Good. Good. Good.
[9888.28s -> 9895.77s]  See that's tight. Good. Good. Good. That's tight. Good. Good.
[9896.25s -> 9911.13s]  Good. I got, I'm close off rope. Cringe. What is that? Is that what he's, what is the top
[9913.37s -> 9918.33s]  That's not even what you said. I just, that's what I thought it said.
[9919.78s -> 9924.66s]  Top. Oh, wow. Dude. That's something. That's some top rope. Cringe. That's a top rope.
[9924.66s -> 9940.63s]  Elbow drop. Cringe, dude. That's a fringe off the top rope. People's elbow. Cringe, man.
[9941.35s -> 9975.46s]  Why is it so laggy? Oh, this is the new car. Too much lag. I can't even see. Fire. Fire. Flame.
[9976.02s -> 9994.30s]  Fire. What is it? It's another one. Oh yeah. It goes yoga. Flame. Yoga. Fire. Yoga. Yoga.
[9994.30s -> 10000.60s]  Yoga. Flame. Yoga. Fire. Yoga. Fire. Yoga. I remember that's the only thing I could hear.
[10000.60s -> 10036.81s]  These people just spam it. Almond or cringe. Or are you sure it's not? I think I like this
[10036.81s -> 10049.30s]  tank better than the other tank. I'd love to get another one of these. I want one of the big guys.
[10050.18s -> 10053.78s]  These dudes. They run around. They have all these super plasma moves. A double grab.
[10055.08s -> 10072.10s]  Bullshit. Link. Link. I'm in the, I'm in the middle of something. I'm kind of in the middle
[10072.10s -> 10105.43s]  of something. I agree. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. I finally got to hear it.
[10107.02s -> 10131.75s]  We've been waiting for that for three days. Well, that was dumb. Come on. Hold this through.
[10132.31s -> 10138.23s]  This dude's fucking all over the place. Holy shit. I need to just relax and.
[10144.62s -> 10149.94s]  Wow. You can't even dodge. How are you supposed to dodge that? You can't even dodge this shit.
[10156.30s -> 10168.31s]  Got it. Okay. What is it? What are we looking at here? Cool.
[10183.03s -> 10240.66s]  Oh, I drew me. What do we get? Barrier Girl and Super Frog. I have two of these.
[10240.74s -> 10262.92s]  How many do I need? Let's see. What is Barrier Girl? 500. Whoa. Actually pretty good. Charge
[10262.92s -> 10269.83s]  gun, beam yo-yo, charge shot, and barrier. Barrier Girl was trained as a secret agent
[10269.83s -> 10275.11s]  as well as her weapons. She also possesses a barrier generator. Use her when you need brute
[10275.11s -> 10286.50s]  force. Most expensive character in the game besides G Red. All right. Let's try. I don't
[10286.50s -> 10302.98s]  really like this thing. Speaking of G Red, let's get him back in here. Co-operate to retake his
[10302.98s -> 10326.50s]  home. I gotta shrink this a little bit. It's blocking my view. All right. Barrier Girl. Let's
[10326.50s -> 10342.90s]  see if you're worth the 500 battery power. The charge shot. I don't know if that hits. It's
[10342.90s -> 10362.23s]  probably pretty good. All right. What is the barrier? Wait, am I invincible? It kind of.
[10363.59s -> 10369.34s]  I'm not sure it's the greatest thing in the world. 500.
[10385.75s -> 10394.94s]  Oh, it's you. This is a Jeep thing. I want one of these. This thing can just peel out. That
[10394.94s -> 10427.13s]  thing's awesome. New car. Maybe I'll get it. Kill, kill, kill. Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[10430.62s -> 10454.33s]  Ow. All right. That ship has got to go. It's a pain in the ass. You know what to do. Just
[10454.33s -> 10472.02s]  shit out. Long range. I'll go unboxing waiting room. Nice. I wonder what he's going to get this
[10472.02s -> 10511.29s]  time. There it goes. Jeep versus tank. We all know who wins this. It would have been stay back. I
[10511.29s -> 10528.46s]  octane vehicle combat. Yeah, kind of. Does every encounter play the same song? Yes, it does. Yes,
[10528.46s -> 10533.90s]  it does. I know. And people probably just. I'm going to turn the music off. It's kind of getting
[10533.90s -> 10562.74s]  in my head too. And I have, well, we'll play some other song. Simpson's hit and run doom,
[10562.74s -> 10571.77s]  eternal OST. Is that, I, but I need to, okay. Doom, eternal OST. I'm going to skip to halfway
[10571.77s -> 10595.00s]  through it. How's that? Just play the America's funniest home videos theme song over and over
[10595.00s -> 10625.05s]  again. Okay. Is there like a, how long has there like a 10 hour version of this?
[10636.68s -> 10649.21s]  Well, here's all of them. Here's every single one. We can, we can. Okay. Let's judge
[10649.21s -> 10658.22s]  these. Cause this is, this is an eight minutes video. I can't turn the sound off all the way.
[10658.22s -> 10675.58s]  I'm going to go down to, no, I can't. I have to just, I have to just turn off the audio coming
[10675.58s -> 10690.87s]  through to crank AFV. All right. I'm just going to mute it. Okay. Let's, let's critique each
[10690.87s -> 10716.94s]  America's funniest home videos. I can't. Okay. This one just, the audio quality just sucks.
[10716.94s -> 10728.81s]  Okay. Let's go. Let's, let's, here we go. Let's get back to the game. This is the first one.
[10739.38s -> 10763.85s]  Nah. Bad. Now bench it. This is recorded with a phone. Nope. Not very good. No. Why, why does
[10763.85s -> 10768.17s]  this have a laugh track? Well, it's because they used to show clips of people like falling down
[10768.17s -> 10785.10s]  stairs. This is long. It's going to, I'm going to be too late. I can't sing along.
[10785.90s -> 10809.83s]  Did they keep the same singer the whole time? Okay. That was that one. This is, here we go.
[10809.83s -> 10816.39s]  Wow.
[10819.91s -> 10822.15s]  I've missed this show. It's still on TV.
[10825.08s -> 10828.12s]  I feel like Vine and TikTok took this over.
[10832.49s -> 10835.61s]  America's funniest home videos is now just every Vine you've ever watched.
[10836.33s -> 10847.67s]  You might be a star tonight. How many Vines and TikToks exist of like somebody falling down or
[10847.67s -> 10853.03s]  like breaking something or like trying to do one thing and then something horrible happens.
[10853.03s -> 10868.92s]  It's like, oh, I just dropped it. What am I fighting though? Use barrier. It's snacks.
[10874.68s -> 10885.29s]  Stacks. Don't wait. I'm, it's still going. It's too much power. This is too much power.
[10886.01s -> 10894.76s]  Nothing. Look at that. I'm dead. They're like five times.
[10895.64s -> 10914.18s]  Yeah. Okay. Now we're getting into like the 2000. No, no, that's too much change.
[10915.06s -> 10927.67s]  Too much change. How many cartoon sounds do you look?
[10944.30s -> 10950.38s]  I, yeah, I got it. I caught it. I caught it. I don't even know what it means, but I just,
[10950.46s -> 10970.70s]  they're like sounds. I don't know what it means. Okay. This is the lag character. I don't want to,
[10970.70s -> 10997.67s]  she's good, but laggy. Tempo change to, what are you thinking? Is the game, wait,
[10997.67s -> 11010.63s]  is this slowing down with the game? Why is this video tied to my frame rate on the GameCube?
[11010.63s -> 11021.24s]  This is actually freaking me the fuck out. I hate this.
[11041.05s -> 11053.75s]  Funny things you do. This is you. All right. Well, the last, this one's bad.
[11054.39s -> 11069.10s]  It's from like 1998 or something. 1997. Eh, not good. Okay. No, I don't like this one. No,
[11069.10s -> 11072.74s]  no, no, no, no, no. I don't like this one either. I feel like it was,
[11089.06s -> 11096.34s]  had to knock on wood, but I'm not someone who has, they made me want to read back to it.
[11096.34s -> 11109.11s]  Yeah. Is this the same song? America, this is you. Did they say that at the end?
[11109.91s -> 11135.00s]  For the Buddy Buddy Boston song? Wait, there's a mashup out of those two songs.
[11135.00s -> 11169.03s]  This is actually, I told you. This is a good song.
[11174.63s -> 11204.60s]  The best part about the mighty, mighty Boston, there were like 200 people in this band.
[11209.82s -> 11218.89s]  I owned this CD. I owned that CD. I used to listen to this on repeat. They're a great band.
[11222.46s -> 11230.74s]  Play the actual song. Is it going to get, I'm not getting in trouble with this.
[11231.38s -> 11246.49s]  It's going to be the VOD. VOD's already gone because you just played four
[11246.49s -> 11250.25s]  America's Funniest Home videos. I want to hear it. It's been a long time.
[11250.25s -> 11255.62s]  This song is all right. Whatever. It's worth it. I love this song. It's a fucking awesome song.
[11256.50s -> 11264.87s]  Let's, let's fucking jam to this for a little bit. It's like, there was,
[11264.87s -> 11280.87s]  yeah, there's a ton of people in this band. Sick. This is genuinely my wedding song.
[11283.06s -> 11314.78s]  I mean, that's great. That's a really good song. A lot behind these lyrics.
[11321.54s -> 11327.67s]  All right. All right. Don't, don't, don't claim this video. I just want to hear it for a second.
[11327.67s -> 11337.37s]  All right. Now back to the, back to the other one. You can't claim this. This is the different song.
[11345.94s -> 11358.86s]  Nice. What's the next one? This one's epic. Dude, this one's epic.
[11359.26s -> 11420.63s]  Which one is this? Persona battle music. It's the same again. Yeah. Wait. This is good.
[11421.59s -> 11426.71s]  This is good thinking music, but when the family has to come up with a final answer
[11426.71s -> 11428.55s]  and they're scrambling around trying to figure it out.
[11450.07s -> 11474.52s]  Double dragon. What is this? I just got smoked. Oh, that was fun. Okay. This song is fucking awful.
[11474.52s -> 11481.48s]  Why? Why do you hate it? Do this one now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[11493.02s -> 11527.67s]  Superman. Wait, this is also the same one. Oh shit. This is sick. Okay. Dude, you know,
[11527.67s -> 11532.63s]  why wouldn't, okay. Imagine if you had these two musicians, if you, why, why does this not exist
[11532.63s -> 11536.63s]  some company that's just like, let's just mash up songs and like just split it 50 who you wanted
[11536.63s -> 11542.34s]  to just get 50 50. Just put this album up, put up like a mashup album and just get permission and
[11542.34s -> 11579.96s]  give them 50 50. People love this shit. I'm not matched up. I know. I don't care. I'm matched up
[11579.96s -> 11597.94s]  in my brain and in my living room, but not on your screen. Okay. Don't claim the bond. What's
[11597.94s -> 11619.70s]  another one? What dragon can fight a tank? None. Put it back on. No, we're all going to get in
[11619.70s -> 11638.44s]  trouble. What's this one? Uh, no, I don't want to listen to Pokemon music, but you, you wrote ass
[11638.44s -> 11644.49s]  next to this one. So let's see what this is. Oh, I don't know. I don't know what this is. No.
[11645.85s -> 11673.62s]  Um, this one's called, this one's just called penis music. Wait, this is the, somebody made a
[11673.62s -> 11678.90s]  video with me doing this with like the people behind the, like into like the restaurant kitchen.
[11679.70s -> 11702.04s]  That's what it's from. That's the meme. This is, this is it. This is the meme. Who are,
[11702.04s -> 11710.81s]  who are these characters supposed to be? Are these from like a cartoon or like a kid's show or
[11710.81s -> 11725.61s]  something? They're from Megamind. Oh, all right. Well, cool. I get it. I guess. What's this one?
[11725.61s -> 11747.54s]  Remember when Jerma spoiled Megamind? I did. Uh, all right now. All right. All right. All right.
[11747.54s -> 11763.86s]  I'm going to, let's put on a Yoshi's story. OST. What's this? You don't want to put on
[11763.86s -> 11798.71s]  Yoshi's story. OST. Wario land music. Wario land four. Hurry up. Okay. I'll try it. Nah,
[11798.71s -> 11816.23s]  fuck that. I know what we're doing. Oh, fuck that. I know what we're doing.
[11818.39s -> 11838.14s]  It's the Neverhood OST. One of the best OSTs ever. Terry Scott Taylor. This shit,
[11838.14s -> 11842.54s]  fuck, this shit is just pops up and down, left and right, every which way.
[11844.06s -> 11862.54s]  Defeat the Cotcher Borg. Hey, there's a little penis music part here for you.
[11863.58s -> 11890.22s]  Holy shit. Pog. When am I going to stream the Neverhood? I streamed Army Crog.
[11893.38s -> 11903.66s]  Nothing can compare. If I can get it to work, I would. It's so, you guys would love this shit.
[11903.66s -> 11909.34s]  You guys, I can't believe that like Twitch has not been, a lot of you guys don't even know. You
[11909.34s -> 11920.01s]  guys would love it. It would be like your favorite thing. I'm doing it. I'll find a way. There's one
[11920.01s -> 11925.37s]  part that just pops up and you need like a save file to patch over it. I don't even know if that
[11926.01s -> 11948.07s]  file exists anymore. It's my favorite game ever made. Yeah, it has to be. It has to take number
[11948.07s -> 11972.12s]  one. It has to. Ask Vinny, he did? Really? Still ask him what he did. Terry Scott Taylor also did
[11972.12s -> 11978.97s]  the soundtrack for Army Crog, but unfortunately, it was a lot of just kind of background.
[11980.01s -> 11984.09s]  Didn't really sing on it. It was, I think there's only one track that he actually sang on and his
[11984.09s -> 11992.07s]  lyrics are just like this. It's just kind of gibberish. It's great. There's a few tracks on
[11992.07s -> 12016.95s]  Army Crog that are awesome. I mean, not like this, like listen. Where's that? We'll go back to this.
[12017.51s -> 12022.79s]  Where's the Terry Scott Taylor demo for Army Crog? When he's talking about going pee pee in his pants.
[12022.79s -> 12026.79s]  You guys would love this guy. I'm serious. I can't believe nobody likes this. I can't believe nobody
[12026.79s -> 12046.89s]  loves this guy. Here it is. Let's listen to it. You guys are going to love this song.
[12046.89s -> 12050.60s]  This is from the Army Crog demo.
[12199.21s -> 12213.14s]  There it is. Yeah, that's Terry Scott Taylor. We can go back to the Neverhood soundtrack.
[12213.14s -> 12214.82s]  If you like that, there's way more on the way.
[12217.96s -> 12221.24s]  It was kind of loud. I'm sorry. I just like burped in your ear.
[12255.80s -> 12259.56s]  You'll need this game forever. Don't worry. You're never going to see it again after today.
[12262.52s -> 12280.87s]  Never play. What's going on? Relax. All right. You guys have to guess my favorite song in this album.
[12291.64s -> 12292.60s]  Spoiler. This is one of them.
[12293.24s -> 12359.80s]  Oh, fuck. That's a big dragon. I love this. This just turned into a listen party.
[12363.75s -> 12392.25s]  This is also a good one. He just coughed. Oh, that was such a good shot.
[12393.21s -> 12453.03s]  Don't die to this. I'm dying with this music on. I'm not going to fuck this soundtrack as a kid.
[12453.03s -> 12465.53s]  Hey, that makes two of us. I have the Imaginarium soundtrack, which is all of it. It's behind me.
[12465.53s -> 12498.10s]  I displayed it on my Reddit shelf. We're going to do, I think I've played this one before, but
[12498.66s -> 12505.24s]  this is from Skull Monkeys. When you went into a bonus room, this is what played.
[12505.24s -> 12512.66s]  If you went into a secret area, this is what would play. It's just great.
[12538.47s -> 12548.63s]  You can linger because I'm your video friend. Think of me as a father figure with a hand to land.
[12549.67s -> 12554.39s]  Here's a little bonus room where you don't have to worry.
[12555.43s -> 12562.71s]  Take your sweet time. You need not hurry. Oh, you're looking incredible.
[12563.51s -> 12571.11s]  You're the bomb and me. I'm kind of like your dad and a little like your mom.
[12572.39s -> 12577.43s]  There are no monsters here. Hey, wait, look over there.
[12580.23s -> 12591.35s]  I was just kidding. Don't be scared. And when you turn this game off in the real world once again,
[12591.35s -> 12601.03s]  you won't have to play, make me leave or try to pretend because I'll be right there when you
[12601.03s -> 12612.63s]  open your hand because I'm your little invisible musical friend. So show me to your pets or show
[12612.63s -> 12622.39s]  me to your pals. You really will impress every nifty guy and gal. Show them you're individual.
[12623.27s -> 12633.83s]  Show them you are bold. Besides, I get residuals for every game that's sold. I'm your little
[12634.55s -> 12638.87s]  invisible musical friend.
[12646.62s -> 12658.55s]  For life. Hey, speaking of Skullmonkeys, why don't we just get on with the Skullmonkeys theme.
[12658.55s -> 12660.95s]  That was the sequel to The Neverhood. Didn't sell very well.
[12661.51s -> 12663.91s]  Wasn't it? People weren't really a big fan of it, but you know, whatever.
[12666.07s -> 12684.06s]  Boringly gameplay. I think I'm doing pretty well considering it.
[12684.94s -> 12700.58s]  Somebody said we're listening to bad music. Um, careful here. You are referencing probably,
[12701.14s -> 12709.58s]  probably the number one, my most favorite thing on earth is this series. So I would be careful
[12709.58s -> 12714.68s]  here. You're talking, this is like literally one or two of my favorite thing that's ever been made.
[12714.68s -> 12731.58s]  Okay. Just want to make sure we're clear. Be careful here. Be careful. Wait, what was I playing?
[12731.58s -> 12752.71s]  Let's do this one. Wait, where is it? Did I X the window out? Did we listen to this one yet?
[12752.71s -> 12777.24s]  Did we listen to this one? Slapper. This one's a classic. Yeah, this one's a fucking classic.
[12779.08s -> 12789.03s]  This is the first thing you hear in the game. That's right. This is the first song you hear
[12789.03s -> 12794.65s]  in the game. You wake up. There's no fucking tutorial in this game. You just wake up,
[12794.65s -> 12799.35s]  this music's not playing. You got to figure out what the hell you're doing. What the fuck?
[12799.35s -> 12810.30s]  What a 10 out of 10 game. I'm not talking about this game. This game's a three out of 10,
[12810.30s -> 12826.36s]  according to fucking publications at the time, which that's wrong too. Played Neverhood. I will.
[12826.36s -> 12832.52s]  I will. I will. I will. I promise. I will. I can't play Armor Crog on launch and then be like,
[12832.52s -> 12835.72s]  Neverhood, yeah, it's a good one. It's my favorite thing ever made, but maybe one day.
[12836.76s -> 12881.42s]  $150, three out of 10 game to read all the Neverhood lore. The game was just a huge,
[12881.42s -> 12887.02s]  there's this huge fuck you in this game. I don't want to give spoilers for it, but it's so fucking
[12887.02s -> 12893.67s]  stupid. It's like the worst, like just fuck you. You guys know what I'm talking about.
[12894.31s -> 12900.62s]  Hold on, pause it. Those of you that played the Neverhood, I don't, don't give it away because
[12900.62s -> 12906.79s]  we're going to have to, we'll see it eventually. But there is a massive, massive tedious thing that
[12906.79s -> 12913.27s]  you have to do or you cannot complete the game. And it takes, I think like at least 15 to 20
[12913.27s -> 12923.29s]  straight minutes of doing this wicked, boring, shitty thing. Oh, like the game you're playing
[12923.29s -> 12947.13s]  now. Quiet. Careful here. Careful. I enjoy you, but be careful. You understand? You're talking about
[12947.13s -> 12954.10s]  one of my, this is definitely not one of my favorite things ever made. This is probably like
[12954.10s -> 12970.22s]  somewhere, yeah, maybe top 100. No, probably like 101. This could be 101. Dude, listen to my gamer
[12970.22s -> 12980.01s]  noises. You don't get to hear these when there's no sound. This game sucks. Admit it. Why would I
[12980.01s -> 12989.88s]  stream this game for three days in a row if I thought it sucked? Why would I do that to bite
[12989.88s -> 13010.89s]  you? I actually think we're probably getting close to the end. Why does chat hate this game?
[13011.53s -> 13019.32s]  I don't think they do. I think it's, I think it's like, I don't think it's very, I think it's only
[13019.32s -> 13033.22s]  like a few people. I think, I don't think it's true. I think people think this is sick. I'm
[13033.22s -> 13036.34s]  going to keep the flying saucer though. That's good. I do think we're getting close to the end
[13036.34s -> 13040.26s]  of the game though. And I'm not going to do like new game plus, new game plus, new game plus.
[13040.26s -> 13045.66s]  Don't worry. Just enjoying a thing that I like. And I know that a lot of people like it too,
[13045.66s -> 13055.46s]  because they've told me I've gotten two or three DMs in the last week. One of which,
[13056.50s -> 13062.42s]  hoping to go fuck myself. But the other two were about, this game seems kind of fun. I hope you
[13062.42s -> 13078.60s]  keep playing it. So two, yeah, that's enough. Here comes the big battle. Oh, you have a helicopter
[13078.60s -> 13101.96s]  note. What about the comedy points? What about it? They look all right. What does that come?
[13101.96s -> 13108.89s]  Does it come out of the bottom? Trying to figure out what this thing does. I think it comes out of
[13108.89s -> 13132.28s]  the bottom. This thing's really good. Holy shit. That was an instant kill. Whoa. Actually, I don't
[13132.28s -> 13150.74s]  like it. I don't like that thing getting replaced. It's too expensive. Swim down? What do you mean
[13150.74s -> 13184.34s]  swim down? Just swim down, man. Yeah, just stand still and spam. It works. So is there like a
[13184.34s -> 13191.38s]  Patapon bundle on PlayStation 4? Or is it just the first one that's available? And is it a scenario
[13191.38s -> 13199.98s]  where Patapon 2 is just Patapon 1 but better? Kind of like the Pikmin games. Does it matter?
[13200.70s -> 13218.28s]  Yeah, Patapon 2 is so much better. Patapon 2 is a straight upgrade. But holy shit, look at this tank.
[13219.40s -> 13233.69s]  What is this? I think this is a bug. I don't think that's supposed to be like that. Patapon 3 sucks.
[13234.25s -> 13239.67s]  So should I just, should I play Patapon 2? Or should I start at Patapon 1?
[13250.09s -> 13267.02s]  2 is really good. Play minus 2. Don't play any video games. 2 is just one but better.
[13271.40s -> 13284.25s]  Ooh, Atra Witch. You win, Jerma? What is this? An unofficial poll? That doesn't mean anything.
[13286.92s -> 13291.40s]  Gotcha Man. I don't care. I like his voice. I love Gotcha Force. I hate Gotcha Force.
[13294.98s -> 13305.93s]  So 26% of people, whatever. Play 2, then 1, then replay 2. What are you talking about?
[13313.10s -> 13317.26s]  I'm getting rid of the saucer. It's too much money and it's too hard to use. What do you do?
[13319.62s -> 13327.77s]  Oh, pretty weak. Stick it in large. Wait, that's what that is. Big spell.
[13328.57s -> 13343.10s]  We could magnify others with the big spell. I have to try it. 480 left. Get rid of you.
[13343.98s -> 13350.33s]  Where's the knight that I like here? This guy. Ah, 540. Fuck. 370. Here we are.
[13350.89s -> 13369.38s]  Let's love 260. Where's Command Girl? Command Girl, where are you? Level 1. No, I have a level 2.
[13371.22s -> 13388.76s]  It's a fucking mess. There we go. Uh, you. No, shit. Um, you. No, you're too much too.
[13388.76s -> 13413.45s]  Who's 2? Any like a 280? A great dragon parade. These are getting more and more intense.
[13413.45s -> 13421.94s]  Remember when this was organized? Yeah. Please vote. Your vote counts. Is this a different poll?
[13421.94s -> 13455.58s]  Okay. Big. It's huge. Go get him. Bro. Can I, does it stack? Did I just make him bigger?
[13457.88s -> 13468.73s]  Uh, all right. Well, what was that? Somebody just dropped a bunch of pots and pans over here.
[13475.50s -> 13483.24s]  You're too big. That's. Wait, how many? This is 8,000 points. Oh my God. This is going to be
[13483.32s -> 13504.60s]  a pain in the ass. I'll just use it. Come on. Spawn. This can take forever.
[13512.81s -> 13518.92s]  How many dragons are there? Each one's a thousand. So there's probably seven more.
[13531.88s -> 13547.74s]  Oh, come on. I just got caught in a double beam. That sucked. Land already. Oh, helicopter doing
[13547.74s -> 13565.10s]  work. What's going on? His face on the wall. That was funny. Don't get killed. Okay. Here we go.
[13565.82s -> 13598.66s]  What a pain in the ass. This is all dragons. At least they're huge targets with my tank.
[13606.09s -> 13625.22s]  Oops. All dragon. What's that from? What is that? Captain crunch.
[13629.86s -> 13643.48s]  Oops. Oh, very. That's, that's funny. What a fake captain crunch fan.
[13644.46s -> 13649.10s]  I like original captain crunch. I don't like, I mean, crunch berries are good, but I don't follow
[13649.10s -> 13668.92s]  all their, I don't follow all their changes. What is happening? Fake fan, fake fan. I like
[13668.92s -> 13693.26s]  original captain crunch. It makes me a fake fan. Apparently fun. He's at the last three or last.
[13693.26s -> 13720.47s]  How many? Three. All right. This is it. Destroy, destroy. That was, this one was a pain in the ass.
[13737.99s -> 13759.14s]  Shoot him. All right. Let's end it. All right. That one was long and tedious. All right. What's
[13759.22s -> 13764.86s]  the, what's the poll at now? See, I like gotcha force. I don't care. I hate gotcha force. See,
[13769.82s -> 13777.67s]  plays a dragon. I'll play as one of the dragons next mission. I promise. Not this one though.
[13777.67s -> 13791.21s]  Maybe I will play with the ice dragon who has the most power. Oh, this is a mess. Uh, 10, 50,
[13801.82s -> 13813.94s]  240, 210. All right. I can do one of these. Where's, uh, no, it's so unorganized. I hate it.
[13814.50s -> 13827.10s]  I'll try the dragon. The sm I thought it said smell battle, the small battle, small, huh?
[13827.90s -> 13860.39s]  You sniff battle. Ooh, pretty good. Actually that charges up fast.
[13868.71s -> 13880.07s]  Oh, are they getting too close? All right. Fly. Get in there. Get in there. Fly in the air. What
[13880.07s -> 13938.66s]  are you doing? Fire. Well, he killed a few people. Oh no. I let out. Oh, Ed.
[13956.87s -> 13981.32s]  Okay. That, that, wow. What an easy level for late game. I love it. Finally. It only took
[13981.40s -> 14008.17s]  15 hours of playing this game to get the powered gunman. Whatever that is. Are you getting tired
[14008.17s -> 14014.82s]  of lettuce, lettuce and tomato hamburgers in this town? You forgot the most important part.
[14014.82s -> 14028.54s]  That don't quite make it. Yeah. Double shot. Punch kick. Powered shot. Powered long shot.
[14028.54s -> 14049.66s]  Let's try it. What are you 380? Ah, we'll do, uh, we'll do, uh, copy paper in the beginning.
[14055.72s -> 14062.60s]  But hot, hot. Keep it cool. Cool. Defeat the girl Borg unit or defeat the machine Borg unit
[14063.32s -> 14076.17s]  or showdown hero Borg unit. Let's do this one. Wait, save the game. DLT, McDLT, hot beefy McD,
[14076.17s -> 14098.31s]  cool crisp LT, new McDLT, the new McDLT. Look, I can do better. What rock? All right. Let's copy
[14098.31s -> 14127.18s]  B for somebody. We're going to copy B for this guy. Bro, bro. Oh, first of all, the,
[14127.18s -> 14137.37s]  I look at person's fucking Tommy gun. This guy sucked for this scenario. It was bad. All right.
[14137.37s -> 14152.42s]  Woody. Oh, it's like a big burst. You get in close with that. He has a double shot. I mean,
[14152.42s -> 14156.66s]  it would work if, you know, if I wasn't surrounded by five fucking people, the dragon's going to come
[14156.66s -> 14163.86s]  in and just wipe out everybody. I can't wait. All right. Bring out the fucking dragon. Let's go.
[14174.63s -> 14213.34s]  Hey, huh? That's shrink. Just run them over already. Shit. This is my last guy.
[14213.98s -> 14233.24s]  It's a bad matchup. Thank God. You say you want a burger to be hot and delicious in your lettuce.
[14233.24s -> 14252.98s]  No, you got it wrong. Ice cold. She, I didn't even see what that was. Ice cold cheese. I mean,
[14252.98s -> 14258.58s]  it's time. What's, what's, what's, what's, what's with this one man spam? What's with this one man
[14258.58s -> 14272.92s]  spam? I'm seeing one man spam. Oh, no, don't time that person out. You say you're getting
[14272.92s -> 14277.88s]  tired of lettuce and tomato hamburgers in this town that don't quite make it. Yeah. You say that
[14277.88s -> 14282.84s]  just once you'd like your hamburger hot and your lettuce and tomato cool and crisp all at the same
[14282.84s -> 14288.52s]  time. Yeah. Well, I say you got it. I'm talking McDonald's new lettuce and tomato hamburger,
[14288.52s -> 14295.16s]  the McDLT, I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side and the hot stays hot.
[14295.16s -> 14301.88s]  The new McDLT, hot, hot, crisp lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side and the cool stays cool.
[14301.88s -> 14307.72s]  The new McDLT, cool, crisp. The beef stays hot, the cool stays crisp. Put it together,
[14307.72s -> 14313.88s]  you can't resist. The hottest taste, the coolest dish. Keep it hot, hot, keep it cool, cool.
[14313.88s -> 14326.36s]  McDLT. McDLT. McDLT. McDLT. It's a good time for the great taste of McDonald's.
[14332.12s -> 14339.16s]  Why am I such a shill from McDonald's? Um, I love McDonald's, it's like my favorite place.
[14339.16s -> 14351.83s]  Oh, what's this new guy?
[14351.83s -> 14353.55s]  Oh, what's this new guy?
[14353.55s -> 14374.17s]  What, he's like a construction bot?
[14374.17s -> 14375.17s]  Donald sucks.
[14375.17s -> 14378.17s]  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I
[14378.17s -> 14396.06s]  hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
[14396.06s -> 14397.06s]  What's the point of this?
[14397.06s -> 14403.70s]  Can I just drop it on his head?
[14403.70s -> 14404.70s]  He hates him.
[14404.70s -> 14409.26s]  Alright, just kill this guy.
[14409.26s -> 14413.66s]  Yeah, you can drop it on their head.
[14413.66s -> 14418.77s]  Now we get to actually see how useful this person is.
[14418.77s -> 14420.61s]  That shotgun's gotta be real close.
[14420.85s -> 14427.06s]  I'm gonna try to get in close to one of these guys.
[14427.06s -> 14428.06s]  Like this.
[14428.06s -> 14429.06s]  Oh!
[14429.06s -> 14434.70s]  Alright, what about the charged long shot?
[14434.70s -> 14442.75s]  Holy shit, that looked insane.
[14442.75s -> 14443.75s]  That hits.
[14443.75s -> 14444.99s]  Ooh, it's very good.
[14444.99s -> 14460.43s]  Come on.
[14460.43s -> 14461.43s]  It's pretty good.
[14461.43s -> 14467.90s]  Nice, hold him in place.
[14467.90s -> 14469.66s]  Nope.
[14469.66s -> 14470.66s]  Good.
[14470.66s -> 14472.09s]  Who's left?
[14472.09s -> 14473.09s]  Uh-oh.
[14473.09s -> 14482.52s]  My arch!
[14482.52s -> 14483.52s]  That bitch is...
[14483.52s -> 14484.52s]  I wanna shoot this way.
[14484.52s -> 14485.52s]  What are you doing?
[14485.52s -> 14488.94s]  Holy fuck, it does hurt a lot.
[14488.94s -> 14489.94s]  Shit.
[14489.94s -> 14499.56s]  He's so good.
[14499.56s -> 14500.56s]  Oh!
[14505.02s -> 14507.86s]  Damn it.
[14507.86s -> 14508.86s]  Still hit it.
[14508.86s -> 14509.86s]  Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.
[14509.86s -> 14520.64s]  Oh!
[14520.64s -> 14521.64s]  It's okay.
[14521.64s -> 14536.31s]  We got our dragon.
[14536.31s -> 14542.45s]  Ice dragon's pretty good.
[14542.45s -> 14549.26s]  Wait, it's the Israel dragon?
[14549.26s -> 14550.26s]  Hold on.
[14550.26s -> 14561.10s]  Wait.
[14561.10s -> 14562.10s]  What is the...
[14562.10s -> 14565.32s]  Uh, I...
[14565.32s -> 14567.01s]  Don't get killed.
[14567.01s -> 14571.90s]  Attack!
[14571.90s -> 14578.26s]  More!
[14578.26s -> 14581.54s]  More!
[14581.54s -> 14587.82s]  More!
[14587.82s -> 14588.82s]  I'll take sugar.
[14588.82s -> 14589.82s]  And water.
[14589.82s -> 14590.82s]  More.
[14590.82s -> 14603.38s]  More, please.
[14603.42s -> 14604.42s]  More, please.
[14604.42s -> 14611.06s]  You're gonna get in the melee range
[14611.06s -> 14612.06s]  with fucking
[14612.06s -> 14613.06s]  Dragon?
[14615.13s -> 14616.13s]  What a fucking idiot.
[14616.13s -> 14617.13s]  What a fucking idiot.
[14618.13s -> 14619.13s]  What a fucking idiot.
[14619.13s -> 14620.13s]  What a fucking idiot.
[14620.13s -> 14621.13s]  What a fucking idiot.
[14629.98s -> 14632.82s]  What...
[14632.82s -> 14633.82s]  Bro...
[14633.82s -> 14639.42s]  What?
[14639.42s -> 14642.38s]  What?
[14642.38s -> 14643.38s]  I get excited.
[14643.38s -> 14644.38s]  I am an excitable person.
[14644.38s -> 14649.91s]  You have a problem with that?
[14649.91s -> 14650.91s]  Turn off...
[14650.91s -> 14651.91s]  If you've got a problem with that,
[14651.91s -> 14652.91s]  turn off the stream.
[14652.91s -> 14654.15s]  Or what?
[14654.15s -> 14665.85s]  Okay.
[14665.85s -> 14666.85s]  Oh no.
[14666.85s -> 14667.85s]  End up the stream.
[14667.85s -> 14668.85s]  End up the stream, boys.
[14668.85s -> 14669.85s]  No, not yet.
[14669.85s -> 14675.58s]  No, not yet. I want to beat this. I got two of these though. That's good.
[14688.91s -> 14691.31s]  I don't want to- the construction robot's stupid.
[14691.87s -> 14696.64s]  Is this game on Steam that we awesome if it was if they just remade it?
[14696.76s -> 14700.44s]  They added more stuff and made it more- have like multiplier and stuff and balance it.
[14701.12s -> 14716.25s]  I got a data crystal for one of these and then just got one of these. It's like fucking Christmas. I want that guy.
[14726.79s -> 14729.03s]  Gared, I don't like this guy. He's kind of dumb.
[14731.84s -> 14740.14s]  390. No. I do like Woody. I can do a command girl. That's good. I like this team.
[14740.66s -> 14749.67s]  Defeat the girl Borg unit. Ooh
[14750.11s -> 14752.91s]  Huge we have massive air support now
[14761.38s -> 14780.00s]  Come on mirror. I'm so glad I have the huge airplane thing
[14780.68s -> 14815.93s]  They're very fast. Just like I am. Kill the support. Kill the medic. Kill the medic first. I've played games before
[14816.77s -> 14837.95s]  Wake up. I just shotgun to her in the face. Oh my god. That guy didn't even get to spawn. Oh
[14856.31s -> 14860.60s]  No heal. No heals. No heals. Oh
[14861.48s -> 14891.12s]  All healers. Come on. All right, just get in. Nice shot. Hell out here. Oh, he's a- he actually punches. That's cool
[14891.80s -> 14905.30s]  I'm ever gonna do a secret
[14905.50s -> 14946.31s]  EUTF 2 stream. Very dope. Did I hit it? No. Oh you healed you piece of shit. I did some good damage
[14946.31s -> 14967.12s]  I'm good. I did some good damage. Check out the dragon. I gotta land. Step.
[14975.66s -> 14985.35s]  The range. Big mistake. What the hell were you thinking knocking me all the way back here?
[14985.87s -> 15005.50s]  Get it. Just fire. Two huge distractions. This is good
[15006.06s -> 15027.42s]  Ice dragon is so good. This was supposed to be long and difficult, but not with the ice dragon
[15027.82s -> 15050.93s]  Hey, you got a long way to go. Come on over here. Oh, hi. I'm bouncing around too much.
[15051.33s -> 15060.03s]  Log Pyra would destroy you
[15061.83s -> 15065.87s]  Well, that would be assuming that the flog pyro
[15066.63s -> 15069.43s]  Was in the game for more than five minutes without getting vote kicked
[15069.99s -> 15096.90s]  Another wire girl. So many of these random crystals. I don't have
[15097.46s -> 15100.55s]  They don't have all the capabilities to combine them though
[15101.03s -> 15116.09s]  Another one. Damn, okay. What's this one?
[15116.37s -> 15118.61s]  Defeat the wing and angel Borg
[15119.05s -> 15121.86s]  Defeat the diver unit

[17135.69s -> 17139.77s]  um
[17139.77s -> 17140.89s]  This is like
[17140.89s -> 17142.89s]  What do you mean anime?
[17142.89s -> 17150.94s]  What have I ever said that policy?
[17151.58s -> 17163.03s]  That's not my policy
[17163.19s -> 17164.71s]  The kid's getting talk
[17164.71s -> 17172.81s]  Just because I don't want to play doki-doki literature club does not mean I have a policy
[17173.21s -> 17176.09s]  Where I won't play a game that has like an animated character in it
[17177.08s -> 17178.60s]  more of these
[17178.60s -> 17180.28s]  Training with these people
[17180.28s -> 17187.08s]  Why will I not play doki-doki literature club?
[17188.12s -> 17190.01s]  because
[17190.01s -> 17193.02s]  I don't wanna
[17193.02s -> 17194.54s]  I already know
[17194.54s -> 17196.30s]  I already know everything
[17196.30s -> 17205.83s]  I don't need to do it
[17205.91s -> 17208.87s]  How hard these were until I got ice dragon
[17216.70s -> 17221.91s]  Ra turn turn
[17222.55s -> 17230.97s]  Do you know how challenging this game was for me a little bit? I had to jump around dive dive dive
[17230.97s -> 17232.97s]  Shoot shoot shoot shoot dodge dodge
[17233.05s -> 17238.60s]  Oh, I am powerful. I am the overpowered character
[17242.01s -> 17243.69s]  anime game policy
[17243.69s -> 17245.29s]  I played that
[17245.29s -> 17247.29s]  recetteer shop game
[17247.61s -> 17251.00s]  It's like hyper anime game
[17251.56s -> 17260.23s]  Because every time I pressed the a button in that game
[17260.87s -> 17263.05s]  The character would go
[17266.36s -> 17275.82s]  That was every a button press I had I thought it was fun
[17283.05s -> 17285.05s]  Apologize. I didn't say what you said
[17285.80s -> 17287.80s]  I said die chokedista
[17288.20s -> 17289.64s]  which means
[17289.64s -> 17291.32s]  God help us
[17291.32s -> 17307.70s]  Yeah, it means like help help me
[17308.58s -> 17309.86s]  Here it is
[17309.86s -> 17324.74s]  Somebody just linked it click it. Oh cool. Uh magnet robot crash
[17325.38s -> 17340.28s]  It means are you okay? Wait, I think I got it. No, what the fuck how?
[17352.44s -> 17354.44s]  How did I get two c's?

[17385.54s -> 17387.14s]  negative
[17387.14s -> 17392.52s]  That was just as every stream I do
[17392.68s -> 17404.39s]  It was me talking at first and then you guys
[17412.36s -> 17415.42s]  What are you gonna do?
[17415.42s -> 17417.42s]  No, don't fight me
[17417.50s -> 17419.58s]  Just stand still while I press x and win
[17421.46s -> 17425.37s]  Stop fighting me. You're supposed to just lose
[17442.28s -> 17444.28s]  Dude, you you've lost
[17445.45s -> 17447.05s]  He just did the thing
[17447.05s -> 17451.82s]  It's not even good. This team sucks his team fucking terrible. This team's fucking awful
[17455.02s -> 17456.22s]  He just did it
[17456.22s -> 17476.66s]  Look at that damage
[17476.66s -> 17479.48s]  Yes burn
[17479.64s -> 17483.96s]  burn
[17483.96s -> 17494.90s]  Yeah
[17494.90s -> 17508.63s]  Oh it is i'm just over here. I just play
[17509.27s -> 17528.87s]  Is the game over yet? Not yet. I'm getting so many characters. Where were this at the beginning of the game?
[17536.30s -> 17550.36s]  Oh, I need to try it. Oh, I need to try it
[17552.90s -> 17554.66s]  That's going against
[17554.66s -> 17559.58s]  Beat the death force unit beat the bombing unit
[17561.06s -> 17563.06s]  Beat the death force unit
[17563.06s -> 17566.07s]  Oh, it's going against the strategy use jelly diver. No
[17567.35s -> 17575.99s]  Okay, fine here
[17575.99s -> 17579.67s]  It's been so long since he pressed a button other than x
[17588.01s -> 17590.01s]  I've pressed b sometimes
[17595.59s -> 17597.45s]  I do
[17597.45s -> 17599.67s]  see
[17599.67s -> 17608.31s]  Gee
[17608.31s -> 17610.31s]  This is too good. Why would I do anything else?
[17610.71s -> 17632.71s]  It's called me a furry
[17632.71s -> 17637.80s]  Uh, no, i'm not actually the term is fucking scaly o c o's
[17638.36s -> 17642.02s]  Somebody told me that like two years ago. So on this stream
[17646.15s -> 17647.75s]  What was that?
[17647.75s -> 17656.20s]  What was that?
[17656.44s -> 17669.77s]  You know how many times i've been corrected on this stream about what is and what isn't a furry
[17671.51s -> 17674.15s]  And if you by the way, if you have a frog, you're not a furry. You're like an
[17675.25s -> 17677.25s]  amphibioid or something, right?
[17681.85s -> 17691.22s]  What is it? But how could a frog be a more that doesn't make any sense?
[17694.36s -> 17696.30s]  It's a scaly
[17696.30s -> 17698.30s]  Frog how was a frog scaly?
[17698.46s -> 17700.78s]  It doesn't make any sense a slimy. Is that what they're called?
[17702.02s -> 17705.99s]  Be real with me here
[17705.99s -> 17708.87s]  Stop i've died just telling you what i've been told
[17711.48s -> 17714.68s]  Yeah, i'm just we're here you're here to correct me and help me understand these things
[17726.54s -> 17728.54s]  So it's slimer a scaly
[17738.86s -> 17746.78s]  Yes
[17746.78s -> 17749.50s]  Oh my computer is crashing

[17757.02s -> 17764.06s]  Help fucking game sucks
[17777.94s -> 17779.70s]  What is making that?
[17779.70s -> 17781.06s]  Teacher noise
[17781.06s -> 17815.02s]  This is the last one finally, this is the weirdest counter-strike rats level ever
[17818.89s -> 17829.54s]  Probably gonna get a bomber
[17829.54s -> 17849.16s]  Time bomber remote bomber. It looks like we have another problem
[17850.02s -> 17852.50s]  Watch out veto. We're receiving a strong signal of the death force
[17853.74s -> 17855.98s]  Look at the greater tri-city area
[17857.02s -> 17859.02s]  It's a huge monster
[17859.10s -> 17863.35s]  What?
[17863.35s -> 17876.87s]  The gigantic battle defeat the cyber death dragon. I didn't save the game in like an hour
[17877.27s -> 17889.80s]  All right cyber death dragon
[17889.80s -> 17890.92s]  versus
[17890.92s -> 17895.59s]  Let's do an edit here. I want we want jelly. We want jelly

[17912.18s -> 17913.46s]  Good with bombs
[17913.46s -> 17916.97s]  It sounds too hard to do
[17916.97s -> 17921.14s]  remote bomber
[17921.14s -> 17922.74s]  Set bomb detonate
[17922.74s -> 17924.86s]  They both did the same thing
[17924.86s -> 17930.41s]  What was that wrestling group back in like the 90s?
[17931.05s -> 17933.54s]  The guys are the spikes the legion of doom
[17934.10s -> 17936.82s]  Yeah, i'm gonna put this guy in because he rhymes with the legion of doom
[17940.18s -> 17941.62s]  Uh

[17943.54s -> 17955.70s]  I have done it. I don't know where the fuck he is. I'm gonna dump this whole box of toys in the recycling bin
[17959.18s -> 17961.70s]  Oh, wait, there's a worm

[18132.87s -> 18145.97s]  Anybody to tell you that?
[18145.97s -> 18147.57s]  Die, come on
[18147.57s -> 18149.56s]  It's like the final battle
[18149.56s -> 18157.52s]  Here he comes
[18157.52s -> 18174.87s]  Fuck didn't do anything
[18174.87s -> 18199.09s]  Whoa, oh this dude are they blowing up on it? I didn't read the instruction manual. Is it working?
[18222.47s -> 18241.56s]  Uh, I I did it. I'm the character that puts the suit on and has no idea how it works
[18243.73s -> 18245.73s]  But the suit is doing all kinds of powers
[18246.37s -> 18248.37s]  Who is it taking me? Whoa

[18287.41s -> 18297.24s]  I just need to get that back and do it again
[18309.81s -> 18315.94s]  Stupid. Oh this is bad. I actually might still do it somehow magically
[18317.81s -> 18319.81s]  If I get another one of those things
[18319.81s -> 18321.89s]  Who's last?
[18321.89s -> 18323.33s]  Somebody's last
[18323.33s -> 18326.28s]  I have one or two more people left. Who was it?
[18326.76s -> 18336.32s]  Oh, he's dead
[18336.32s -> 18338.32s]  No damage before you died. Who is it?
[18338.90s -> 18340.02s]  New guy
[18340.02s -> 18347.56s]  I don't know what new guy does
[18347.56s -> 18363.27s]  New guy's about to die
[18363.27s -> 18365.27s]  Uh new guy's dead. Who's last?

[18387.81s -> 18394.04s]  I didn't know that a gachabor could increase in size like that
[18394.84s -> 18396.84s]  My headache stop. I am
[18399.20s -> 18400.80s]  Now the time has come
[18400.80s -> 18404.18s]  The galactic emperor has stolen his her personality
[18404.98s -> 18407.24s]  I have obtained enough gf energy from this human
[18407.96s -> 18410.20s]  You're not going to use the power that destroyed our planet again. Are you?
[18414.04s -> 18416.04s]  D-red this time with your help we can stop him
[18416.60s -> 18418.36s]  Give us your courage
[18418.36s -> 18420.76s]  We can never be defeated by the evil galactic emperor
[18421.56s -> 18424.60s]  Vito get ready for the final battle against the galactic emperor
[18425.24s -> 18437.78s]  Here we go the final battle. Just kidding
[18438.58s -> 18471.62s]  Here we go. Uh, just do the orange ones
[18472.18s -> 18474.42s]  Defeat the elite unit
[18475.20s -> 18478.80s]  This is this is okay. This is like the this is the hardest shit that we're at the end. This is the end
[18479.20s -> 18481.20s]  Do the last like five missions
[18481.52s -> 18484.16s]  Get rid of the jelly if I I can't get rid of the jelly now
[18484.72s -> 18486.72s]  All that matters is I have this ice dragon
[18487.68s -> 18496.36s]  What I mean, it's right there it was the last level
[18506.61s -> 18508.61s]  It was the last level
[18511.19s -> 18512.39s]  No
[18512.39s -> 18515.91s]  They figured it out. He's too slow. Just run around him
[18516.47s -> 18528.98s]  idiot
[18528.98s -> 18532.26s]  Falling in front of me. No, that's good
[18535.00s -> 18537.00s]  Don't let them fly. Don't let them fight. Don't let the fight do it
[18537.72s -> 18573.73s]  The cool dragon I know
[18573.81s -> 18576.61s]  I know but we're almost done. Don't worry
[18587.95s -> 18589.95s]  Godzilla godbeam is so good
[18590.21s -> 18592.34s]  Imagine if I didn't have that
[18592.42s -> 18593.86s]  I probably would have gave up
[18593.86s -> 18599.80s]  I would have been like guys. This is gonna take too long. I'm mostly going to scream for like four or five hours of dead time
[18601.19s -> 18603.19s]  I'm sorry. I can't do it anymore
[18603.91s -> 18605.91s]  But we got dragon so i'm able to
[18633.57s -> 18654.23s]  Damn it. They are
[18654.31s -> 18669.84s]  Fuck who do I have? This is the dumbest character in the whole game. Why is it even on here?
[18670.00s -> 18679.46s]  But I want the character to be the thing that I was gonna say i'll say it after the end of the stream
[18691.03s -> 18693.59s]  No, i'm not gonna say it. It's it's a literal
[18694.55s -> 18717.12s]  Bull I can't how come I can say it at the end because everyone's gonna leave
[18717.76s -> 18725.76s]  Did I make it? Oh fuck. Come on. Give me the next one
[18726.87s -> 18728.15s]  that's

[18767.48s -> 18770.66s]  um
[18770.66s -> 18772.66s]  150 all right a normal ninja
[18773.38s -> 18775.14s]  Level three here somewhere
[18775.14s -> 18782.56s]  Where's my level three ninja?
[18785.16s -> 18787.16s]  All right, whatever. I don't care. He's not here
[18790.79s -> 18792.79s]  All right. This is the final battle
[18792.95s -> 18802.07s]  You promised what?
[18802.07s -> 18803.91s]  normal ninja
[18803.91s -> 18806.16s]  Omega lull
[18806.16s -> 18807.76s]  Everyone is here, right?
[18807.76s -> 18809.76s]  I had to sneak away so my family wouldn't notice
[18810.40s -> 18812.08s]  Grown-ups are panicking
[18812.08s -> 18814.61s]  It would be everyone can see the huge monster in the air
[18815.41s -> 18818.32s]  I should have stayed hidden after all
[18818.32s -> 18820.16s]  I can do this. I can do this. I can do this
[18820.16s -> 18822.72s]  We have to save orochi, too

[20493.17s -> 20495.17s]  Tell us the thing I will at the very end
[20495.25s -> 20503.36s]  At the very end, but for now we have 15 from shadow teddy. Thank you

[20523.52s -> 20529.89s]  Not bad
[20529.89s -> 20530.93s]  Not bad
[20530.93s -> 20536.18s]  It's that little part in the middle. That's all
[20536.42s -> 20547.11s]  But thank you shadow teddy for the 15 dolls recently stumbled on your streams after years of watching a youtube vid youtube vids
[20547.67s -> 20550.87s]  Much love and thanks for the entertainment. Thanks for the 15 dolls and
[20551.67s -> 20556.18s]  Welcome. I was on youtube for a long time and
[20557.06s -> 20559.06s]  I'm about to be
[20559.06s -> 20563.08s]  On twitch for the same amount of time that I was on youtube if you could believe that
[20563.72s -> 20566.92s]  They're about to be tied
[20566.92s -> 20574.05s]  I was on youtube for about five to six years and now we're on twitch for about five years. So we're coming up there
[20574.53s -> 20578.76s]  Peaceful hailey. Thanks for the 250
[20578.92s -> 20582.32s]  I've been doubting myself again whether I should be streaming or not
[20582.72s -> 20585.04s]  Everyone always compliments me on it and like is super nice
[20585.04s -> 20589.28s]  But I get that one person who puts doubt in my mind whether I should be doing it or not
[20589.84s -> 20591.68s]  It's what I want to do, but i'm a girl
[20591.68s -> 20593.68s]  So I feel like I can't make it on twitch and i'm terrified
[20594.24s -> 20597.32s]  The compliments I do get feel like I don't deserve it
[20597.88s -> 20602.42s]  Like it's really a me issue. Well, i'll tell you right now. It sounds like you're second guessing yourself a little too much
[20602.98s -> 20611.43s]  streaming should be something that you want to do something that you've that you really feel like doing and
[20612.88s -> 20615.84s]  Sure, we make jokes on this channel about like, oh what do you want me to do? Look at me
[20616.32s -> 20619.20s]  What oh chat's bullying, but i'm gonna bully you you're bullying me what came
[20619.84s -> 20622.53s]  but at the end of the day
[20622.53s -> 20624.53s]  you need to
[20625.30s -> 20627.70s]  kind of be in control of you and
[20628.82s -> 20630.66s]  Be comfortable with what you're doing
[20630.66s -> 20633.92s]  Streaming should be something that you every time you turn it on you like this is what I want to do
[20634.80s -> 20640.40s]  And there will be people that are going to say negative shit. Unfortunately, this is the nature of the internet
[20641.12s -> 20644.50s]  It's the nature of kind of where we are. It's unfortunate, but it's true
[20649.51s -> 20654.52s]  and you either take some of the maybe more harsher criticisms or
[20655.08s -> 20657.24s]  Some of the negative comments of people that say things
[20658.45s -> 20661.09s]  And you either just ignore them or you know you
[20662.20s -> 20664.76s]  It's hard to not be like oh you shut up
[20665.32s -> 20672.96s]  What are you fucking dumb?
[20672.96s -> 20681.20s]  but just make sure it's something you want to do make sure something you really feel like doing because if it's not
[20683.06s -> 20684.26s]  And you'll know
[20684.26s -> 20692.63s]  Make the criticism feel you to do it more to do more and work harder
[20693.84s -> 20696.12s]  um
[20696.12s -> 20701.72s]  It's hard. Yeah, but at the same time some people just kind of come in and just say shit just because they're just being crazy
[20702.52s -> 20707.67s]  And some of the criticisms are some of the kind of attacking is just because they feel like doing it
[20707.67s -> 20710.39s]  It's not like oh, hey, here's what I think how I think you could improve your stream
[20711.03s -> 20716.72s]  But I wish you luck
[20716.72s -> 20719.20s]  Make sure you want to do it though. That's the most important thing
[20722.64s -> 20724.64s]  oiki, thanks for the five dollars
[20724.64s -> 20731.04s]  Remember chat has ruined me. I started saying resident sleeper in casual conversation or in texts when things were boring
[20731.44s -> 20733.44s]  And how to explain it to my mom what it meant
[20734.34s -> 20738.82s]  Then last night she sent me that she used it in a post on her political blog
[20739.62s -> 20745.01s]  But she talked about how much she hates joe biden, please help. Oh boy
[20749.59s -> 20753.43s]  oh, man
[20753.43s -> 20755.43s]  I I got nothing to say about that one. That's
[20757.49s -> 20759.35s]  that's a
[20759.35s -> 20760.95s]  you uh
[20760.95s -> 20764.55s]  Mom is now using your lingo and now you're gonna have to figure out another words
[20765.64s -> 20768.84s]  Because once your parents start doing it, you can't do it anymore. You gotta get resident sleeper
[20768.84s -> 20773.89s]  Now you gotta come up with a new one. It's over
[20778.31s -> 20784.32s]  Resident sleeper
[20784.32s -> 20788.76s]  Well, I hope you figure that out. She'll probably just get over after a while
[20789.48s -> 20792.20s]  She'll probably be like, I don't understand this. I'm gonna go back to saying
[20793.00s -> 20794.44s]  tired
[20794.44s -> 20796.44s]  Maybe not. Maybe she's here now
[20798.93s -> 20803.97s]  Major moose man. Thanks with 250 first don't know a long time fan. I've been only watching regularly since sakiro
[20804.53s -> 20806.90s]  Streams have really been helping me through college
[20806.90s -> 20810.34s]  And I know you said that if you didn't play it in november, you wouldn't stream it
[20810.90s -> 20814.02s]  But I was wondering if you ever play star wars jedi fall in order. It's not perfect
[20814.50s -> 20816.50s]  But its combat is like sick. I'm gonna stop you here
[20816.90s -> 20819.86s]  I played it for about 45 minutes off stream and I did not like it
[20821.96s -> 20827.52s]  I was not a fan first hour of that game or hour and a half was was climbing
[20828.77s -> 20840.45s]  Metal boxes and then sliding down and then I got killed like 15 times
[20841.33s -> 20842.21s]  by
[20842.21s -> 20869.73s]  That weird like pig dog thing. I was like, I don't want to play this. I love star wars. You got
[20870.69s -> 20875.19s]  mount fiji
[20875.19s -> 20879.35s]  You rage quit the tutorial. No, I got out of the tutorial and I got to that first area where you have to
[20880.16s -> 20882.80s]  Like track down the the jedi's smell
[20883.60s -> 20888.82s]  And I stumbled into this cave and there was like a boss in the cave and I was like, oh cool
[20888.82s -> 20890.90s]  The first boss and I died like after 10 times
[20891.70s -> 20895.22s]  And I was like, I don't even like this game. That's what happened. I'm just telling you the truth
[20895.22s -> 20907.01s]  I'm just telling you what happened. It went from 15 to 10. So that means it was 20
[20907.73s -> 20911.08s]  If you're paying attention
[20911.08s -> 20915.24s]  I love star wars. I just wasn't a bit. I yeah, I just wouldn't didn't grab me
[20915.72s -> 20923.25s]  Drummage door. Thanks for the 250. Yo funny man guy bro, dude mate friend. I watched your rhythm heaven heaven heaven. Hold on itchy
[20923.97s -> 20925.57s]  I've watched hey
[20925.57s -> 20933.59s]  Let's try that over. Hold on itching my eye. I watched your rhythm heaven fever stream. It's kind of a hard string of things to say
[20934.39s -> 20938.40s]  Uh, maybe realize you'd most likely really enjoy fantastic game called thumper
[20939.52s -> 20943.60s]  Uh, some have classified it as a psychedelic horror rhythm game. I've actually
[20944.32s -> 20947.78s]  I don't think I can play this from I remember looking at this before
[20948.50s -> 20950.50s]  This game really hurts my eyes
[20952.42s -> 20959.62s]  Something about like that moving with the neon colors and it kind of hurts my head
[20960.18s -> 20968.82s]  Yeah, my brain melts
[20968.82s -> 20975.56s]  Unfortunately, it looks fun, but I know I wouldn't be able to I'd be like i'd have to fucking stop after like 30 minutes
[20979.78s -> 20981.78s]  But no, it's it does look fun
[20984.64s -> 20986.80s]  One less game to get in the way of jeru crew
[20989.11s -> 20991.67s]  Red wall was thanks for five dollars germ a longtime watcher
[20991.67s -> 20993.91s]  You really helped me when I was just down in the dumps a while ago

[20999.03s -> 21003.33s]  I don't know
[21003.33s -> 21005.33s]  Here's the problem I have with armored core
[21005.57s -> 21008.31s]  I want to have like
[21008.31s -> 21013.41s]  12 of them. Do you have I mean, what's ones do you play? Do you it doesn't matter?
[21014.05s -> 21020.32s]  There's a lot of them just
[21020.48s -> 21022.24s]  There's only four
[21022.24s -> 21027.68s]  It's 15 games play them all or just play four
[21030.60s -> 21033.48s]  Okay, which one what what if you guys can give me reliably?
[21034.44s -> 21040.28s]  The one or two that or the one that is the best one like the one that you should play
[21043.11s -> 21046.87s]  And i'll probably give it a try four is the one it's four. Okay
[21051.89s -> 21053.84s]  Uh, maybe
[21053.84s -> 21057.76s]  They'll say also warhammer 40k space marine too because I want you to suffer with the rest of us

[21744.32s -> 21748.64s]  And then and then they'll hang out and you'll have like some music while you're out working in the yard
[21749.65s -> 21752.85s]  And you get to enjoy the cool birds over at the bird restaurant
[21753.33s -> 21757.20s]  But then you're probably gonna get another problem squirrels love that shit

[22413.75s -> 22422.05s]  Oh, i'll tell you a quick little story about the bath. I took a bath last night
[22422.77s -> 22425.35s]  and um
[22425.35s -> 22426.76s]  I
[22426.76s -> 22428.36s]  Have this device
[22428.36s -> 22430.36s]  That I put my ipad in
[22431.16s -> 22434.92s]  And it hooks into the ipad and it's this big stretchy
[22435.54s -> 22436.92s]  solid it's
[22436.92s -> 22441.56s]  Like a big wire that I can fold and move around and it can the ipad can stand up
[22441.96s -> 22445.72s]  You can bend it you can put it around your arm. You can put it on the edge of a bed and it's pretty cool
[22445.80s -> 22448.15s]  It's actually a really cool device
[22448.15s -> 22452.37s]  Um, so yesterday I was filling the bathtub and I was setting this thing up
[22453.33s -> 22455.89s]  And it was like getting it ready
[22458.07s -> 22462.21s]  And I turned the water on and the ipad
[22463.11s -> 22464.55s]  shook a little bit
[22464.55s -> 22466.79s]  Because it was like I had it standing up on the edge
[22467.75s -> 22469.75s]  And it fell into the water
[22470.15s -> 22474.60s]  And by the way the water wouldn't even like really turned on it was like just barely like not even a tenth of a
[22474.60s -> 22480.56s]  Centimeter of water on the ground and it like went into the water and like I grabbed it immediately and then I was fine
[22480.64s -> 22484.48s]  And I wiped it off quickly with the towel and it's fine
[22484.48s -> 22486.80s]  I mean, no the water was like on but it wasn't like the whole bath
[22486.80s -> 22491.08s]  It was like just hitting the surf that was hitting the bottom. You know what I mean? It was a good story
[22497.16s -> 22504.12s]  Water wasn't on he just dropped his ipad in the bathtub and he added the water part to make you think
[22504.52s -> 22508.92s]  That wall that could have been crazy, but there was no water in that tub. He's a liar

[22844.82s -> 22847.14s]  I'm gonna play my two hundred and fifty dollar piece of plastic
[22857.94s -> 22859.94s]  CD made out of plastic metal
[22860.26s -> 22862.76s]  What is a cd made out of?
[22862.76s -> 22865.72s]  Aluminum metal. I that's an I seriously what?
[22866.36s -> 22870.53s]  Is a cd made out of is it plastic? It's like a weird compound
[22872.45s -> 22874.47s]  Tough brittle plastic called polycarbonate
[22876.18s -> 22881.65s]  And sandwiched in the middle is a is aluminum, right? Okay. I had it right plastic and aluminum. I had it right
[22882.13s -> 22891.60s]  No, it was fun. Thanks for the thousand bits
[22892.16s -> 22898.00s]  You have a kitty. Thanks for the 250 germa. You won't be the first one to finish gotcha force on twitch
[22898.88s -> 22900.50s]  uh
[22900.50s -> 22925.57s]  Some summa did it a few weeks ago ban this person
[22930.76s -> 22933.56s]  Is this where I go? What's who's summer?
[22934.12s -> 22936.12s]  What's who's summer and then you say summer
[22936.60s -> 22939.80s]  Is this when is this how is this how this joke plays out?
[22947.92s -> 22949.22s]  Yeah
[22949.22s -> 22951.88s]  right, okay
[22951.88s -> 22956.68s]  Dark soul. Thanks for 250. Are you not able to do the amazon watch together streams on here or something?
[22957.32s -> 22960.76s]  I've seen other streamers able to use that and watch like star trek
[22961.16s -> 22964.40s]  We should see what's on there and maybe we can watch something pog instead
[22965.20s -> 22967.84s]  By the way, if you're going to do half life alex
[22968.72s -> 22972.32s]  You should do that before bone works because bone works is so good. I think alex just sucks
[22973.56s -> 22976.63s]  damn a strong opinion
[22979.00s -> 22986.40s]  Uh, I don't know man. Um, the reason why I didn't do the amazon watch party is because
[22987.84s -> 22989.84s]  It's a very limited catalog of stuff
[22991.36s -> 22993.68s]  And it's only available to the united states
[22994.24s -> 22998.50s]  So I was like, yeah
[22998.50s -> 23002.18s]  Maybe if they start opening that up that might be fun to do like officially
[23004.37s -> 23007.73s]  But yeah, it's only united states and it's only if you have amazon prime
[23009.03s -> 23014.55s]  And I i'll be honest. I'm not in the market of trying to make less people watch my stream
[23015.84s -> 23020.88s]  I don't that's not i'm not into I don't want to do that. I have no interest in doing that
[23021.36s -> 23028.04s]  You have to have amazon prime you have to have twitch prime you have to be from the united states
[23028.60s -> 23031.96s]  Like I just like carved off a significant portion of people that watch
[23032.52s -> 23035.64s]  I'm in the market of wanting people to watch not telling people they can't
[23037.91s -> 23040.79s]  It's a kind of like an exclusive club thing that I don't really want to do
[23050.21s -> 23061.16s]  If they start expanding it, then yeah, i'll try it. But as of right now, probably not doctor zero fox
[23061.32s -> 23063.32s]  Thanks for the 15 dollars
[23063.48s -> 23065.80s]  They say u w u
[23066.52s -> 23068.52s]  U w u
[23068.60s -> 23071.36s]  Thanks to 15 bucks
[23071.36s -> 23073.52s]  Hey dried cleaner. Thanks to 300 bits germa
[23073.52s -> 23077.12s]  I was wondering if you ever played fable 2 or streamed it some of the best games ever
[23077.20s -> 23078.56s]  I recommend it for one of your streams
[23078.56s -> 23084.05s]  I played this shit out of fable 2 played this shit out of fable 1 and I got to the part in fable 3
[23084.63s -> 23087.43s]  Where you opened up chests to do things?
[23088.07s -> 23090.47s]  And said this game sucks and stopped playing it
[23090.47s -> 23102.13s]  It was like within the first hour and a half, but I do I love that franchise
[23102.21s -> 23104.21s]  I've played the hell out of the first two games
[23104.37s -> 23113.62s]  They're very fun, but probably not on stream. I've played through them multiple times
[23114.18s -> 23117.22s]  With multiple characters doing multiple builds there's not much else
[23117.22s -> 23121.46s]  I can do in fable 1 and 2 that I have not done in a playthrough that i've done years ago
[23125.03s -> 23132.47s]  They're great though peaceful. Haley. Thanks for the 250. I don't want to be a debbie downer
[23132.95s -> 23136.07s]  But to be honest, I don't have anyone in my real day-to-day life to talk to
[23136.47s -> 23139.75s]  But an hour ago me and my boyfriend split up after five years
[23140.56s -> 23143.68s]  We've known each other for longer, but god, I never thought this would happen
[23144.32s -> 23147.68s]  I need to focus on me now. I don't really know what else to say. Thanks for listening
[23148.16s -> 23153.16s]  That's a long relationship. That's a long time
[23154.21s -> 23156.84s]  But you're right
[23156.84s -> 23159.81s]  Now you do you
[23159.81s -> 23162.24s]  You take care of your life
[23162.24s -> 23163.44s]  And move forward
[23163.44s -> 23172.69s]  That's really all you can do
[23172.69s -> 23174.69s]  You don't back up on the highway
[23178.69s -> 23188.85s]  forward
[23188.85s -> 23193.54s]  Maybe you don't
[23193.54s -> 23196.20s]  Your analogies suck
[23196.20s -> 23202.68s]  What if you're on the highway you go forward you don't stop you don't go back you move forward and you go to your exit
[23203.16s -> 23205.00s]  If you miss your exit
[23205.00s -> 23210.74s]  You don't stop you fucking go forward and you find another way to get off the next exit and you finally figure out you fucking
[23210.90s -> 23220.95s]  Where you go?
[23220.95s -> 23222.95s]  You clip through the trees
[23228.72s -> 23233.52s]  No, you don't do that
[23233.52s -> 23236.79s]  You go off road
[23236.79s -> 23238.79s]  What kind of car do you drive?
[23238.79s -> 23244.40s]  but anyways
[23244.40s -> 23251.70s]  Uh, i'm gonna say it again. You don't go reverse on the highway done and that's exactly how you should feel
[23253.28s -> 23262.18s]  Forward don't look back forward clip through any trees. Don't just fucking go forward
[23262.98s -> 23264.18s]  right
[23264.18s -> 23268.21s]  Chat beta streamer doesn't turn around on the highway
[23268.93s -> 23270.93s]  Yeah, beta streamer doesn't
[23270.93s -> 23272.87s]  Die in a car wreck
[23272.87s -> 23275.27s]  Okay, that sounds good. That sounds great. Actually
[23277.12s -> 23283.57s]  Good. Okay
[23283.57s -> 23285.57s]  Why the trees on the highway?
[23285.89s -> 23292.76s]  Can you imagine if they were just a bunch of trees in the road and you have you going like 60 plus miles per hour?
[23293.64s -> 23297.40s]  Holy shit, what a design oversight that would have been
[23301.54s -> 23303.54s]  That's challenge mode
[23305.04s -> 23310.64s]  It would be like skiing in the olympics those flags
[23312.66s -> 23317.09s]  but anyways, hailey
[23317.09s -> 23318.93s]  I wish you the best that's
[23318.93s -> 23320.93s]  It's not the best thing to happen
[23321.01s -> 23331.62s]  But you'll be all right. Just keep going forward. Don't fucking go on. They don't hit the brakes on the highway
[23331.78s -> 23335.40s]  And the germa 985 says dog shit advice
[23336.39s -> 23340.39s]  Literally never ask germa for advice on anything because all of his advice
[23340.95s -> 23341.67s]  is
[23341.67s -> 23347.62s]  dog shit
[23347.62s -> 23352.10s]  true
[23352.18s -> 23354.18s]  Hit the brakes ever
[23354.82s -> 23359.11s]  No, don't no do that when you're getting off
[23359.89s -> 23362.93s]  Do that when you're getting off you have to hit the brakes when you're getting off
[23363.01s -> 23374.07s]  Otherwise, you're gonna be in big trouble. I wish you the best though. Take care of yourself. Take care of you
[23375.94s -> 23379.46s]  Hey, thank you mick for the $15 germa. It's good to see you play a game
[23379.46s -> 23380.58s]  You like so much
[23380.58s -> 23387.57s]  And i'm excited for you to get back to finishing every nancy drew game back to back. You're gonna be very disappointed
[23387.97s -> 23400.68s]  Thanks the 15 bucks old 70 ham. Thanks for three dollars and 20 cents
[23400.84s -> 23402.44s]  Hey germa
[23402.44s -> 23414.04s]  Here's some bite-sized bits because you're epic. Oh, thanks. Do I get the junkie donut? Thanks for three bucks
[23418.18s -> 23420.18s]  Rock writing. Thanks for the 300 bits
[23421.12s -> 23424.24s]  Uh, you don't have to read this if you want to wrap the stream up. No, we're good. We're good
[23424.96s -> 23427.12s]  I mean i'm i'm about 30 minutes over my
[23427.76s -> 23430.80s]  Time but at my maximum time, but we got an over heel going. It's okay
[23431.68s -> 23436.88s]  This is this. It's good. Just not like eight hours
[23436.96s -> 23440.64s]  Like i'm I just can't I gotta stop doing like the fucking seven to
[23441.52s -> 23443.52s]  Eight plus hour streams. I can't do them anymore
[23446.85s -> 23448.85s]  Like I physically have to stop doing those
[23449.84s -> 23451.84s]  I'm sorry, but it's just the it's reality
[23460.26s -> 23463.62s]  No more 12 hours. No, the lord of the rings stream will be the longest stream
[23463.62s -> 23466.66s]  I will ever do ever until the stream doesn't stream anymore
[23467.46s -> 23471.46s]  It sucks. Well, actually i'm actually kind of happy about that. That's fine. But anyways, they say
[23472.18s -> 23477.06s]  Uh, my fiance and I watched the complete lord of the rings trilogy last night perfect timing
[23478.02s -> 23480.82s]  And I hate that now my nostalgic connection to the soundtrack
[23481.38s -> 23485.70s]  Has been replaced with a fever dream. That was when I fell asleep to your two towers stream
[23486.36s -> 23489.96s]  Then woke up at some unholy hour of the night to the uruk-hai theme
[23490.52s -> 23493.40s]  On a seemingly endless loop and you trying to knock down
[23493.96s -> 23496.52s]  Those damn orc ladders playing his gimli
[23497.24s -> 23506.16s]  Anyway, my best to you chat and auto, you know, it's really sad. Is somebody telling me that I have
[23506.96s -> 23510.77s]  Ruined the lord of the rings for them. That's heavy
[23513.19s -> 23514.23s]  That's
[23514.23s -> 23518.45s]  That's tough to hear. Holy that's not that's bad
[23520.90s -> 23525.48s]  Something that is so hard to ruin for somebody is that franchise and i've done it somehow
[23532.84s -> 23534.84s]  I've never seen the films looked boring
[23535.89s -> 23541.76s]  Really good. You'll like them. Just watch them watch them when you have like the amount of time
[23542.32s -> 23544.32s]  When you get like three weeks to yourself
[23544.72s -> 23554.93s]  Watch the lord of the rings, but thanks rock rock writing. Sorry to have ruined your favorite franchise ever mine, too
[23555.49s -> 23557.16s]  Thanks, three bucks
[23557.16s -> 23561.40s]  Shadows one disciple. Thanks for the 250 germa. Your enthusiasm forgot your force is palpable
[23561.72s -> 23564.36s]  It's great when you love a game. Don't let chat tell you differently
[23564.52s -> 23567.30s]  I would probably enjoy this game too, but I don't have a game cube
[23567.46s -> 23571.41s]  I played the hell out of a similar game on playstation 3 called battle of z
[23573.60s -> 23580.05s]  However, I am more concerned about something else. Where did you get your degree in gaming slash gamers licenses?
[23580.87s -> 23586.52s]  I couldn't find a certificate of gaming for you in nevada, massachusetts nor anywhere in new england. Are you certified?
[23586.76s -> 23591.14s]  You don't have to have you don't have to yeah, I am
[23592.37s -> 23602.02s]  Look, I got my certification when I was like eight years old. So this doesn't expire. I got my championship
[23602.82s -> 23612.36s]  Uh, I got my gamer championship license thing that I showed that happened when I was a kid. They never expire
[23612.60s -> 23622.48s]  You never have to renew them the blockbuster video game championships. Yeah, I got two free rentals a month for a year
[23622.72s -> 23641.49s]  I have certified. I haven't been recertified in a long time. Doesn't mean I wasn't thanks at the 250 though
[23642.05s -> 23647.84s]  Thanks at the 250 though wembley ttv
[23647.84s -> 23654.00s]  Thanks to the 250 I showed a pal of mine who was a gt driver the burnout spy cam video with no context
[23654.56s -> 23658.32s]  His first reaction was looking at your license photo saying what is that?
[23658.88s -> 23661.12s]  I guess you do have that sort of effect on people
[23663.57s -> 23665.57s]  Yeah, I remember. Yeah, I remember this
[23665.89s -> 23668.53s]  Yeah with the the terrifying
[23670.10s -> 23675.54s]  Balding head face down like a long face with the nose. Yeah, it's horrible
[23676.10s -> 23678.10s]  That's the second image on the internet that I hate
[23685.84s -> 23689.60s]  The eye crazy eyes mouth one is number one
[23690.32s -> 23701.14s]  And in the bathrobe head pointed down eyes up is the other one. Thanks to the 250
[23701.70s -> 23708.58s]  Hey dark soul. Thanks for 250 if you want to play another fun robo game, you should try gundam breaker 3 for playstation 4
[23709.30s -> 23713.27s]  You have to import it or use an hk account
[23714.87s -> 23718.31s]  HK account is on amazon and play asia in an english version
[23718.79s -> 23722.23s]  It's a really good game, especially if you want to make your own cool gunplay fighter
[23723.04s -> 23734.45s]  Don't play new gundam breaker on pc though. That one sucks. All right done. Stop making his list bigger
[23736.48s -> 23738.48s]  Don't make his list bigger
[23738.80s -> 23745.75s]  The list is never ending. It's like your christmas list. Did you guys ever do the christmas? Okay
[23746.47s -> 23748.15s]  I remember when I was a kid
[23748.15s -> 23749.83s]  we used to get the
[23749.83s -> 23756.10s]  There would be this catalog that came in the mail and they I don't know if it was like jc penny or
[23756.66s -> 23759.30s]  With some big box store and they had a toy section
[23759.86s -> 23765.67s]  And I remember what I would do is I'd take the this huge catalog and I would just take a sharpie
[23766.15s -> 23769.19s]  And I would circle every single thing I wanted for christmas
[23770.82s -> 23776.29s]  and give it to my parents like this is what I want here it is and
[23777.19s -> 23779.03s]  it was like
[23779.03s -> 23787.14s]  Two grand worth of stuff. It's like oh, oh, oh, this is what this is what you think santa's gonna bring you
[23787.92s -> 23789.92s]  Wow, okay. Well, we'll see
[23790.39s -> 23796.72s]  And you're getting like a quarter of a percent of the stuff on that on the stuff you circled and you don't even remember
[23799.48s -> 23810.02s]  Like maybe like not even a tenth of those things is what you got for christmas. I just don't oh wow
[23810.10s -> 23813.44s]  Yeah, I like this. I don't remember circling like
[23814.30s -> 23824.02s]  125 items got to be young more like one 100th. Yeah
[23824.66s -> 23830.40s]  Did you expect to get it all mine was a wish list? I don't know my like
[23830.96s -> 23834.96s]  Seven-year-old brain thought that hey, this is what I get. That's what I want
[23840.69s -> 23843.25s]  Yeah, it's a wish list means I wish I had all this
[23845.72s -> 23858.40s]  Here wish-grant hers make this a reality parents. That's how it was. He's a cringe rich kid
[23860.26s -> 23861.99s]  What?
[23861.99s -> 23867.64s]  Spoiled no, I just told you that they would be like, oh, okay, and I would get like I would get like
[23868.12s -> 23877.38s]  Maybe six items. I see some of your fucking christmas tweets and christmas things you guys get
[23878.79s -> 23885.68s]  I see some of the toys that you get some of you guys get like fucking sneakers like 300 dollar pairs of sneakers
[23886.32s -> 23898.05s]  How does he know? I know
[23898.05s -> 23901.62s]  I used to have to walk around with loaves of bread on my feet
[23902.18s -> 23906.64s]  That's what we did. We had two loaves of bread and we would squish on them and walk on them
[23907.89s -> 23918.58s]  And how dare you guys?
[23922.24s -> 23924.24s]  Family walking around
[23925.12s -> 23928.53s]  Like let's say you got a family of five
[23928.53s -> 23936.90s]  That's 10 loaves of bread and they would just get all mushed up and it would only work for like not even a day
[23937.99s -> 23940.31s]  You'd be going through like 50 loaves of bread a week
[23942.61s -> 23957.48s]  loafers
[23957.48s -> 23960.07s]  Okay. All right
[23960.07s -> 23967.25s]  Yeah, and then and then when we got you know, it was a huge deal and we got like the big pieces of naan bread
[23967.81s -> 23974.21s]  It was like they were it was awesome. I think like 10 loaves of naan bread
[23974.77s -> 23976.77s]  might actually be
[23976.77s -> 23979.01s]  More money than a like two or three pairs of shoes
[23979.49s -> 23990.40s]  How much is a pair of just just shitty sneakers? How much is a pair of just like I just go by
[23990.80s -> 23995.52s]  Here's another great thing about when we talk about the computer that's all the way to the left at best buy
[23996.24s -> 24005.86s]  What is the shoe all the way to the left at the shoe store? Well, what's like the dell in spiron of the shoe world?
[24009.11s -> 24020.76s]  20 at walmart like 15 like crocs new balance omega low
[24022.05s -> 24023.65s]  knockoff toms

[24101.57s -> 24112.20s]  But does that mean you can fit 10 in there the maximum toes?
[24112.92s -> 24114.60s]  That you have are 10
[24114.60s -> 24115.88s]  is
[24115.88s -> 24120.04s]  Like 10 out of 10 toes is the maximum you fit could you fit both feet in there?
[24120.84s -> 24133.96s]  That's the max size for canadian
[24134.60s -> 24141.57s]  I lost my place

[24145.68s -> 24147.81s]  There they are
[24147.81s -> 24155.80s]  Uh, where were we right here? Hey manly leprechaun. Thanks for five dollars germa. This is my first time donating to a streamer
[24156.52s -> 24157.96s]  Glad you're my first
[24157.96s -> 24161.00s]  I don't know how often you make you take game recommendations from viewers
[24161.56s -> 24166.84s]  But you should play fossil fighters for the ds. It's a goofy fun and interesting game that could be entertaining to watch
[24171.60s -> 24173.60s]  What is it sloggers?
[24175.81s -> 24177.86s]  sloggers
[24177.86s -> 24183.36s]  I don't think I want to
[24188.03s -> 24190.79s]  Sloggers
[24190.79s -> 24193.49s]  Even saying that
[24193.49s -> 24195.49s]  Hey, what'd you get for a pair of shoes?
[24195.97s -> 24197.81s]  Ah, you know
[24197.81s -> 24200.84s]  sloggers
[24200.84s -> 24202.84s]  I got a good pair of sloggers
[24205.01s -> 24210.77s]  Why is why do I think when I think that I think when you step down the wet sound is heard like
[24212.21s -> 24220.61s]  Like they're already pre-wet they've been pre-wet like they dunked in water and held under there
[24220.61s -> 24224.23s]  So it gets into the foam and shit my sloggers
[24224.79s -> 24235.25s]  Wait, wait, what happened? Oh manly leprechaun, right?
[24236.13s -> 24238.13s]  fossil fighters for the ds
[24238.21s -> 24241.22s]  There's a lot of cool ds games
[24244.18s -> 24246.18s]  Although I don't know how well it would run on an emulator
[24246.66s -> 24250.26s]  If you even use those just want to put a word in for what I think would be an underrated gem
[24250.90s -> 24254.98s]  Either way keep up the good work and give auto a belly rub for me will do
[24257.44s -> 24262.40s]  Absolutely will
[24262.40s -> 24264.00s]  fossil fighters rocks
[24264.00s -> 24267.22s]  Maybe yeah. Yeah, let me see

[24333.86s -> 24339.16s]  Appreciate it. Don't worry about it. Thanks for the 15 bucks

[24351.04s -> 24353.57s]  Did I smell something? I don't know what it was
[24354.05s -> 24362.52s]  I don't know. Uh, thank you your cat for the 15 dollars your cat

[24369.73s -> 24371.73s]  Always trying to get all the different borgs

[24382.21s -> 24385.86s]  Glad to give it some attention
[24385.86s -> 24394.47s]  I can't believe my cat donated. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Thanks for the 15 bucks

[24449.60s -> 24475.14s]  What's a short hike short hike? This looks kind of cool

[24545.81s -> 24550.69s]  Cubivore is like four hundred dollars. I think it's like the most expensive game cube game that I looked at
[24554.45s -> 24556.53s]  Gotcha forces 250 cubivore is like four
[24558.31s -> 24560.80s]  You would love cubivore
[24560.80s -> 24562.56s]  You can afford it lol
[24562.56s -> 24570.53s]  All right, but if I get made fun of for buying a 250 game
[24571.09s -> 24575.57s]  Double that and you know what just what should I just despite chat buy a 400 game?
[24576.21s -> 24588.15s]  Didn't somebody somebody gave me 250 to say to do that. I would only be i'm only playing myself here
[24589.28s -> 24590.56s]  Huh

[24595.36s -> 24596.80s]  I have to live with that
[24596.80s -> 24598.80s]  I have to buy that game for four hundred dollars
[24598.96s -> 24600.98s]  You don't have to do that
[24600.98s -> 24605.54s]  You could literally just open up a youtube like gameplay video of it right now and just watch it for like an hour and be like
[24605.62s -> 24608.15s]  Oh, this is stupid
[24608.15s -> 24619.04s]  Okay, just go watch a gameplay commentary on it
[24619.84s -> 24623.99s]  Yeah, I did look at it. It did look good though. We'll see

[24754.31s -> 24757.11s]  You know, I used to hate your tf2 videos

[24767.49s -> 24770.05s]  Turned by the by by the way
[24770.61s -> 24775.81s]  If you ever play roblox on stream look up the roblox hellzone galleria 2.0 and play it
[24779.07s -> 24786.90s]  Gpm played it on stream and loved it. Did you give everyone a laugh? I've seen a lot of monkey s's. I'm sure that it's probably uh
[24788.12s -> 24791.12s]  a normal zone
[24791.12s -> 24801.78s]  But hey, thanks for watching used to hate the videos and now you like them appreciate it

[24808.58s -> 24810.58s]  Bingo sunshine. Thanks for the 250
[24811.22s -> 24813.22s]  Remember these streams convinced me to pick up the game
[24813.70s -> 24820.69s]  Albeit through nefarious means because physical copies cost a hundred times more than this donation laughing my ass off
[24820.93s -> 24825.97s]  Anyway, the game is gorgeously emulated. It's entirely legal to own backup copies of games you already own
[24826.05s -> 24833.72s]  So would you consider emulation in the future for stuff? That's going to be a display piece. Anyway, that's the thought i've done it already
[24834.12s -> 24843.75s]  Uh, no more heroes one was played on the dolphin because no more heroes on the wii
[24844.39s -> 24847.59s]  Runs like an absolute trash can and I didn't want to put up with it
[24847.59s -> 24852.92s]  I didn't want to have you put up with it either. I admitted that you guys already knew that
[24860.12s -> 24861.80s]  I don't
[24861.80s -> 24863.56s]  look
[24863.56s -> 24865.64s]  The wii is right here
[24865.64s -> 24868.60s]  The game disc is right there and the wiimote's right here
[24869.16s -> 24875.94s]  What do you mean? I never told you yeah, I did
[24877.12s -> 24880.96s]  I talked about how it how it looks like I would ran like such dog shit that I had to emulate it
[24884.92s -> 24887.24s]  I've like held up the shit. I was like look look at me
[24887.88s -> 24905.25s]  Yeah, some games need it because they just don't run well and they don't pull a lot of some here's another thing some games do not
[24905.81s -> 24907.81s]  Pull through a capture card well either
[24909.06s -> 24912.26s]  at all
[24912.26s -> 24914.26s]  you've seen some of those games that are like
[24918.90s -> 24922.34s]  Some of them sound horrible being pulled through capture cards and being scaled
[24924.48s -> 24930.56s]  So it's only out of necessity and I I only if I own the games and own the consoles
[24931.12s -> 24932.72s]  I don't do it ever
[24932.72s -> 24943.70s]  I don't I don't do it. I don't I don't do this
[24945.56s -> 24947.56s]  Right dot dot dot, right
[24952.44s -> 24958.32s]  That's dumb
[24962.88s -> 24964.96s]  Right, right. Okay, let's keep going
[24966.40s -> 24968.77s]  Uh bingo sunshine. Yeah
[24968.77s -> 24973.89s]  Uh, I it is a thought on a lot of things and about I consider everything I I consider all options
[24974.93s -> 24976.29s]  maxi kaspersky
[24976.29s -> 24978.93s]  Thanks for the five dollars germa told me to never reverse
[24979.41s -> 24983.57s]  And i've been accelerating into this brick wall for 15 minutes. Please help. I'm going to run out of gas
[24988.32s -> 24991.28s]  Hey medhi merrin, thanks for the five dollars
[24992.08s -> 24994.74s]  Hello germa. I have a question
[24994.74s -> 24998.50s]  I'm quite a bit of a workaholic. I have adhd and I can't stop my head from thinking
[24998.90s -> 25000.90s]  So I try to think about productive things
[25000.90s -> 25003.06s]  Ever since quarantine there's nothing left for me to do
[25003.62s -> 25006.02s]  Done all my work and chores and despite there being nothing to do
[25006.02s -> 25008.50s]  I feel like i'm wasting away and failing at something that doesn't exist
[25009.06s -> 25011.22s]  Do you have any advice on how to teach myself to relax?
[25011.86s -> 25014.15s]  exercise
[25014.15s -> 25016.10s]  exercise
[25016.10s -> 25017.46s]  jogging
[25017.46s -> 25018.66s]  walking
[25018.66s -> 25023.25s]  Lifting and you can even do it. You can do it in your house. Do it in your room
[25024.79s -> 25026.39s]  push-ups sit-ups
[25026.39s -> 25035.20s]  That's not a bad idea
[25035.20s -> 25041.92s]  Yeah, do them right now
[25041.92s -> 25046.28s]  play an mmo
[25049.48s -> 25054.60s]  It's all it's also good to stay at least somewhat active in the middle of something like a quarantine like this
[25055.40s -> 25057.96s]  because
[25057.96s -> 25060.44s]  If you like for instance me right now
[25061.16s -> 25066.85s]  If I don't move around and I don't get up and do something or at least do like light exercise
[25067.89s -> 25069.89s]  You really got to keep yourself loose
[25070.93s -> 25077.54s]  And other people said do something creative start painting. I'm not sure where you are
[25077.54s -> 25082.82s]  I'm, not sure if you can still get like amazon deliveries or and if that's a possibility it should be
[25083.78s -> 25084.82s]  um
[25084.82s -> 25086.63s]  Order some paints
[25086.63s -> 25088.39s]  Had them just dropped at the door
[25088.39s -> 25091.89s]  Do some painting who cares have fun?
[25096.79s -> 25098.39s]  You could read
[25098.39s -> 25105.41s]  You could take a bath. I love baths. I've become a huge bath fan
[25106.45s -> 25108.45s]  I love just getting a light in a candle
[25109.25s -> 25111.08s]  Getting in the bath
[25111.08s -> 25113.08s]  You just sit there and you just take it in
[25113.81s -> 25115.81s]  Have some salts sprinkled
[25116.37s -> 25120.85s]  Lightly

[25128.16s -> 25130.64s]  Don't just don't dunk your ipad in there. I lied about that

[25193.25s -> 25197.86s]  And not from the archives. I know that you've decided to move to the great city of las vegas
[25198.58s -> 25200.58s]  For someone who has boston
[25201.14s -> 25203.14s]  Is one of the top picks on where to move?
[25203.38s -> 25205.56s]  Do you have any suggestions on where to look?
[25205.56s -> 25213.20s]  Like where to live?
[25213.20s -> 25215.20s]  I mean if you can live in boston
[25215.60s -> 25223.94s]  There's a lot of awesome places in boston just you can just walk to everything. There's so many great bars and restaurants
[25224.72s -> 25228.55s]  And just stuff to do if you if you live like in city limits
[25234.36s -> 25240.18s]  Just go live in a bar
[25240.18s -> 25242.10s]  It is it is expensive
[25242.10s -> 25243.38s]  It is expensive
[25243.38s -> 25246.32s]  I only said just said go to hell why?
[25246.80s -> 25250.20s]  Ban that person till tomorrow's pat upon stream
[25250.52s -> 25260.40s]  Well, you don't know I talk about go live in hell. Oh, no, no, they're safe. That's fine. I would say if you can
[25261.57s -> 25264.58s]  In the city is is awesome
[25264.58s -> 25273.06s]  If you if you're able to afford it can get very expensive though safe for now
[25280.52s -> 25282.52s]  boston more like bossed out
[25290.15s -> 25295.11s]  Hey, johnny nice mountains. Thanks to 300 bits jerma. Are you familiar with the souls games? I've never heard of them
[25295.67s -> 25297.67s]  I have no idea what you're talking about
[25298.44s -> 25300.44s]  Don't get it. I don't know what that means. Is that like a meme?
[25300.52s -> 25304.52s]  Did I just say something I wasn't supposed to say did you give me is there like a like souls?
[25305.24s -> 25310.12s]  Like these nuts or something. I don't understand. I'm I'm I'm a funny joke, I guess
[25313.38s -> 25315.38s]  Hey peaceful. Haley. Thanks for 250
[25316.68s -> 25320.12s]  Just wanted to say I appreciate you and your community a lot. Everyone is so kind to me
[25320.68s -> 25323.16s]  Also, I said this years ago, but I still look up to you
[25323.72s -> 25327.24s]  And I do want to stream i'm just hard on myself and I want to do this more than anything
[25327.88s -> 25332.04s]  Thanks for being the thanks for thanks for the backing up into traffic advice don't do that
[25343.43s -> 25346.07s]  Streaming is fun streaming is really really really
[25347.41s -> 25352.61s]  Awesome, but you want to you gotta want to do it
[25354.07s -> 25355.83s]  You shouldn't have any pressure
[25355.83s -> 25357.54s]  to turn it on
[25357.54s -> 25359.54s]  and if your pressure is coming from
[25360.00s -> 25365.38s]  Needing to have to do it and I'd say that might be a problem
[25368.56s -> 25376.21s]  Wanting and needing you got to want to do it and just have fun doing it and just don't think about anything else
[25379.92s -> 25382.24s]  Not at all. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I want that's good
[25382.88s -> 25392.02s]  Because the more that you start to need it the more you're going to give yourself
[25393.22s -> 25410.87s]  Potentially unrealistic things that you have to do. I hope that helps like eating a shoe
[25411.51s -> 25421.06s]  We don't talk about that. What about wanting to stop on the highway and that person and don't let them drive
[25424.16s -> 25426.48s]  All right. No, don't they're okay. They're asking a question
[25427.12s -> 25434.95s]  Hey bingo sunshine. Thanks for the 250 germa. The point was the games look and sound better emulated. Just emulate them
[25435.43s -> 25446.36s]  I mean, that's what I said, but I kind of I like putting the disk in and I like loading up the
[25448.12s -> 25453.48s]  Well, you know, I actually don't get to hear that I always mute that part
[25454.88s -> 25457.32s]  Got you
[25457.32s -> 25459.76s]  um, I like to bone stuff
[25464.76s -> 25466.20s]  I and and
[25466.20s -> 25469.56s]  It's it hasn't been that big of a problem
[25471.60s -> 25474.64s]  Plus like let's be honest. I know that
[25475.36s -> 25477.52s]  Look, it's anybody can just sit here and go
[25478.24s -> 25482.56s]  Just do it. Just do it. It's fine. Nobody cares. Twitch doesn't care
[25483.04s -> 25484.79s]  They don't care
[25484.79s -> 25486.95s]  But if somebody ever wanted to
[25488.55s -> 25491.03s]  It's still it's still
[25492.58s -> 25494.58s]  Technically illegal
[25494.92s -> 25498.69s]  You know what i'm saying? So like I have to just be I have to be careful
[25498.77s -> 25501.25s]  I don't want to be like yeah, everything I fucking own is pirated
[25501.57s -> 25506.13s]  Here's my folder with 300 gamecube games in it. I've didn't buy a fucking thing
[25506.77s -> 25509.09s]  Hi, i'm germa985 streamer with
[25510.51s -> 25514.05s]  6000 people watching don't you know look at this you can just get all this shit for free
[25515.84s -> 25519.76s]  I I gotta like be care. I don't want to I gotta be careful
[25520.40s -> 25529.46s]  You listen to copyrighted music. That's just as illegal dumbass
[25533.36s -> 25539.19s]  Um, that's no it's not
[25540.50s -> 25546.53s]  Playing a mighty mighty boss stone song from the youtube channel of mighty mighty boss stones
[25548.29s -> 25550.29s]  You can't go to youtube.com
[25550.69s -> 25552.69s]  And open up a window
[25553.17s -> 25564.21s]  With got your force in it
[25564.21s -> 25573.84s]  You can if they don't give you an easy legitimate way to get the game then fuck them
[25575.76s -> 25583.20s]  Yes, and I know I know I know but this this difference between listening to a song on stream
[25583.92s -> 25586.02s]  and having
[25586.02s -> 25587.70s]  thousands of dollars
[25587.70s -> 25590.26s]  In game products downloaded to my hard drive
[25590.90s -> 25595.75s]  That I did not pay for
[25595.75s -> 25606.88s]  Even if it's not available. I just I just have to be careful. I just laughed so hard. My parents probably woke up
[25612.37s -> 25630.34s]  Sure roger that mr boomer and like like nintendo games wasn't that like doesn't it isn't nintendo?
[25631.30s -> 25633.38s]  Like do not fucking do that
[25634.92s -> 25639.72s]  Didn't they they've removed all that they cease and desist fucking people hosting that shit all the time
[25640.28s -> 25650.04s]  It's been seven hours. What happened to oh, I can't stream for more than four hours
[25650.28s -> 25655.25s]  I had to be gotcha force
[25655.25s -> 25659.73s]  And I mean the stream has been over for like an hour or two. He's been hanging out
[25660.29s -> 25664.37s]  But I did I did say that I did say I didn't want to go more than six seven hours
[25665.57s -> 25667.73s]  I said no, I did say that sometimes
[25668.29s -> 25673.40s]  Needing to finish stuff I I would be able to it'd be okay, but it's primarily to
[25674.52s -> 25680.68s]  Avoid my it just completely give me a hard wall to not have like eight plus hour streams ever again
[25681.08s -> 25692.80s]  The same nintendo sells shitty ports of super mario world on every console for 20 dollars
[25693.36s -> 25696.55s]  Yeah, but they still sell it. That's the point
[25699.22s -> 25702.42s]  Look, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and like argue any like
[25703.41s -> 25709.57s]  Copyright they deserve to charge that they don't fuck those companies like i've used emulators on this stream. You've seen it
[25710.13s -> 25713.33s]  And I probably will continue to do so
[25714.98s -> 25716.98s]  If I've you know find it necessary
[25720.20s -> 25730.69s]  I mean what what you didn't buy the dos games monkey ass
[25732.69s -> 25739.73s]  Yeah, but the dos games are like archived into fucking they're like that archive.org is like the public domain of all things
[25747.75s -> 25749.75s]  It's an abandonware. Yeah
[25751.52s -> 25753.52s]  playing abandonware versus
[25753.92s -> 25756.88s]  Capcom still owns the rights to beautiful joe
[25760.28s -> 25764.28s]  Like capcom didn't go, you know, hey, you know what beautiful joe is abandonware now
[25765.06s -> 25767.06s]  No, they have that shit under lock and key
[25767.22s -> 25776.23s]  But they aren't doing anything with it
[25776.23s -> 25781.35s]  Uh, welcome to my argument for uh, why won't gino just be added as a nintendo character?
[25781.83s -> 25794.37s]  There's been there's been like three or four cases where nintendo employees have been like yeah, that's a cool character
[25794.45s -> 25798.45s]  Maybe we have to be fun. Wow, I think oh gino's really cool. Yeah
[25799.09s -> 25801.35s]  He's just locked in a cage
[25801.35s -> 25804.13s]  at square enix
[25804.13s -> 25811.91s]  And then hey square enix. You ever gonna use that character? Nope. Can I use that character? Nope
[25815.30s -> 25817.30s]  I they're good doing business with you
[25817.54s -> 25824.84s]  But that happens a lot
[25824.84s -> 25833.92s]  Long story short is that I just I just gotta be careful whether I use it or don't use it
[25834.24s -> 25840.16s]  I know like I know everyone's saying this person does it this person does I know and that's all right. I do too
[25840.64s -> 25850.88s]  We say hi to peaches. Hey peaches
[25851.44s -> 25858.24s]  Welcome to the stream

[25882.40s -> 25884.40s]  The thing I was going to tell you

[25910.16s -> 25912.16s]  Okay, it looks like something
[25912.40s -> 25914.40s]  Oh, I can't
[25914.48s -> 25917.12s]  I don't like doing that because people but you could like clip me saying this
[25918.16s -> 25920.16s]  Just like give it to somebody and be like, hey look

[25937.04s -> 25939.36s]  Thanks for the 300 bits germa. I am a newer viewer
[25940.08s -> 25942.08s]  Watching for about three months. Well, welcome to the channel
[25943.44s -> 25946.88s]  I thought it was pretty cool to see a streamer who used to live in my hometown. You're a funny dude
[25947.52s -> 25950.88s]  And i'm glad to watch some more in the future any advice on starting a youtube channel
[25951.60s -> 25953.60s]  Just go just do it
[25953.92s -> 25955.36s]  See what happens
[25955.36s -> 25957.35s]  But I did
[25957.35s -> 25962.84s]  See what happens?
[25962.84s -> 25966.84s]  No, that the the the just do it forehead is actual advice for this
[25972.82s -> 25974.82s]  Started 10 years ago
[25983.20s -> 25984.95s]  true
[25984.95s -> 25986.39s]  true, I
[25986.39s -> 25993.52s]  The best advice you give to anybody starting any new creative endeavor
[25996.64s -> 25998.00s]  Go for it
[25998.00s -> 25999.84s]  Do it as best as you can
[25999.84s -> 26001.94s]  And try to set realistic expectations
[26005.11s -> 26009.43s]  Do it for fun. Do it because you like it do it because you want to tell something do because you want to show something
[26011.16s -> 26013.46s]  Same advice I would give for anything
[26013.54s -> 26018.26s]  Don't do something because you feel like you have to do it do it because you want to do it and do it as best
[26018.34s -> 26019.54s]  As you can
[26019.54s -> 26024.34s]  If something good happens if you get some viewers then fucking awesome. Keep going keep doing it
[26024.98s -> 26026.98s]  If you don't get any viewers right at the bat
[26027.54s -> 26029.51s]  Keep going
[26029.51s -> 26031.96s]  Just keep doing it
[26031.96s -> 26036.92s]  And then find out over the months coming weeks and months if it's something that you actually wanted to do
[26037.40s -> 26045.20s]  You've said this advice six times today
[26045.60s -> 26047.60s]  While it was asked at six separate times
[26048.32s -> 26050.32s]  And people might not be here. They might have left
[26050.88s -> 26053.57s]  It's homework advice
[26059.43s -> 26065.27s]  Don't take youtuber advice from this xtuber. That's another thing. I don't know the game at all and I never did
[26068.55s -> 26072.23s]  I didn't know I you think I knew what I was fucking doing
[26073.78s -> 26077.06s]  When it came to like how to make it big on youtube
[26079.84s -> 26082.88s]  I like ran somebody over with a car in gta and laughed at it
[26084.21s -> 26086.21s]  What happened? How did I get here?
[26095.65s -> 26097.70s]  true
[26097.70s -> 26103.38s]  Now I obviously I put a lot of work into that channel and a lot of stuff that I really cared about
[26103.86s -> 26109.78s]  That's a jokey little like hey, it's a funny thing. I spent a lot of work. I spent a lot of time on that channel
[26110.34s -> 26114.69s]  In quotes work. Are you supposed to be banned?
[26115.49s -> 26120.13s]  Wait, i'm not supposed to read what you say. You don't put that uh, ban that person until tomorrow's pad upon stream
[26121.01s -> 26123.01s]  And I actually mean that this time
[26124.08s -> 26128.80s]  No, I'm not actually yeah. No. Yeah, i'm not supposed to read what you say. That's i'm not supposed to read you
[26129.36s -> 26131.36s]  Now you've gone till tomorrow's pad upon stream
[26132.69s -> 26137.49s]  Yep, i'm about to turn the stream off and now i'm not yep. You're tomorrow. You're not gonna see me until tomorrow
[26138.37s -> 26146.47s]  What was I talking about? Oh, yeah
[26148.45s -> 26152.85s]  I would just get ideas and do them and if people thought they were funny or they liked them then they did and if they
[26152.85s -> 26154.85s]  Didn't then they didn't and I just kept doing them
[26156.24s -> 26158.72s]  There's a shit load of channels that people like didn't think were very good
[26159.52s -> 26160.88s]  That's okay
[26160.88s -> 26162.88s]  I learned and I tried to make them better
[26164.18s -> 26166.98s]  There are videos people thought were some of the best things that i've ever done
[26167.62s -> 26172.50s]  You learn you say okay. What was what did that work? Let me do more of that. Let me try some more of that
[26176.16s -> 26178.40s]  How why did you just hit me?
[26179.84s -> 26184.88s]  But um incredibly long-winded word fucking soup I was going to word soup after like six or seven hours
[26186.20s -> 26187.00s]  um
[26187.00s -> 26192.12s]  Do it because you want to not because you need to that's like the best advice I can give to anybody doing anything creatively
[26193.08s -> 26199.64s]  Thanks for three bucks. We only have three more donations from held rich five dollars
[26200.80s -> 26205.54s]  Jeremy, I found a glowing review for gotcha force from 2004 if you wanted some vindication

[26257.12s -> 26259.12s]  ear-burning voice clips
[26259.96s -> 26263.72s]  Only story mode unlocks new borgs and there are camera problems
[26264.20s -> 26270.90s]  We're doing cheese toasties with tomato soup. Sign me up
[26271.54s -> 26274.16s]  That sounds incredible
[26274.16s -> 26283.89s]  Pretty good review. I would agree with it. Hey to sewage to capsicum. Thanks for the five dollars
[26283.89s -> 26286.21s]  Jeremy, I realized the other day that you don't actually wash your hands
[26286.77s -> 26289.57s]  They actually wash each other while you just stand there and watch
[26290.95s -> 26293.36s]  Thanks for the five dollars
[26293.36s -> 26294.80s]  Maxie kaspersky
