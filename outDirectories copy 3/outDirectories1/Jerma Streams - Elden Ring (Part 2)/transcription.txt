[1.85s -> 5.05s]  Somebody said, Jerma, please only stream for four hours today.
[5.05s -> 23.86s]  Why? That's not enough time to beat the third boss, Wendelinda Gargantuan.
[23.86s -> 38.74s]  Rerecorded. What do you mean I have to leave? I have to leave? Well, when you come back, we'll probably still be live.
[38.74s -> 43.91s]  Anything less than 12 hours today is quitting.
[43.91s -> 54.26s]  Uh, I can't- I can't agree with that. Unfortunately.
[54.90s -> 58.10s]  I've got one of those voices today. That's a radio voice.
[58.10s -> 62.10s]  Because I talked a lot yesterday for about nine and a half straight hours.
[62.10s -> 67.86s]  And I woke up today with what I would call something that would be a guaranteed gig.
[67.86s -> 74.84s]  For an early morning commute, uh, talk show host.
[74.84s -> 79.64s]  Joe, what's your eyebrows? Maybe I will eventually show you my eyebrows, but not right now.
[79.64s -> 82.68s]  Right now we're going to talk about, um, Elden Ring.
[82.68s -> 90.34s]  Hi Joe. Does he want to come in here? Hold on. You want to come in here?
[90.50s -> 131.19s]  I opened the door and he just ran. He was like, let me in!
[131.19s -> 133.75s]  And then I opened the door and he went, and just sprinted.
[134.55s -> 136.84s]  Does- uh, maybe he wants something. I don't know.
[136.84s -> 138.44s]  He doesn't want- he doesn't seem like he wants anything.
[144.28s -> 150.60s]  Bring him back. I think he wants somebody to like, chase him around the house.
[153.40s -> 159.86s]  Dogs are so weird. Hey, come chase me around the- come chase me around the living room!
[160.92s -> 165.48s]  I do. And we play, I run after him, and then he runs after me.
[166.87s -> 168.63s]  One of our oldest, oldest games.
[169.27s -> 175.88s]  What's with the pickle thing? Okay, are people really trying-
[175.88s -> 178.81s]  are people trying to make a meme in Elden Ring? Right?
[179.37s -> 182.87s]  That's- that's what's going on, right? Like, pickles, like,
[183.83s -> 188.47s]  pickled relish and shit, right? This is like an Elden Ring meme thing that's happening, I think.
[188.47s -> 194.90s]  You should take CBDTHC to play on extra hard mode.
[195.88s -> 201.03s]  If I were to be high, I would not be able to play this game.
[201.67s -> 205.29s]  Do you understand how horrible that would be?
[206.01s -> 210.82s]  The stream would be an embarrassment. It would be embarrassing.
[212.98s -> 215.54s]  I would be walking around and forgetting where I was,
[215.54s -> 218.10s]  and I wouldn't even be able to fight enemies and shit. It would be impossible.
[227.14s -> 230.14s]  What did you call last night? Okay.
[234.49s -> 238.89s]  Like, yesterday was an embarrassment? No, was it? I pre- I killed like four bosses!
[239.77s -> 243.45s]  And I explored the world, and I immersed myself in the world,
[244.63s -> 247.91s]  and I walked around and did stuff. I got four boss progression.
[252.31s -> 254.39s]  Your eyebrows were embarrassing. All right.
[255.29s -> 258.10s]  Let's just- are you guys ready? Because I'm ready to play.
[258.82s -> 268.12s]  About the same boss for four hours? No, I fought the same boss for like an hour and ten minutes.
[269.13s -> 271.29s]  You can't- don't- don't gaslight me here.
[272.46s -> 277.18s]  I played that boss for about an hour and ten minutes, and you know how I know.
[277.98s -> 284.14s]  I went back, and I just checked on my VOD to see the exact time it took for me to beat that boss.
[284.86s -> 287.10s]  And it was about an hour and 12 minutes.
[287.10s -> 292.94s]  Just to make sure that I could defend myself if somebody ever said,
[293.99s -> 297.91s]  oh yeah, dude, just like you spent five and a half hours on the first boss,
[297.91s -> 302.71s]  I can go, no, it was an hour and 12 minutes. Go back and look at the data.
[304.74s -> 307.72s]  Did you eat another salad? No, I actually did not.
[308.28s -> 311.69s]  So I might be playing at a little bit less power today.
[313.51s -> 315.83s]  I did have a little bit of a snack, and I'm- and actually,
[315.83s -> 317.51s]  because I know I'm going to be going long today,
[318.49s -> 323.61s]  I'm ready to take a food break somewhere in the middle, which will be a salad.
[327.22s -> 329.78s]  I do have my- I've got my green tea powder here.
[331.51s -> 334.23s]  It's the thing that gives me my gaming powers.
[336.09s -> 338.33s]  Oh, it's ready. I think I'm ready to go.
[342.66s -> 344.94s]  Can you burp on stream? Maybe.
[346.50s -> 355.70s]  Okay. Hello. How are you? Previously on Elden Ring.
[356.34s -> 361.54s]  Do you have a Caesar salad? No, I don't really- I don't know.
[361.54s -> 365.06s]  Ever since I found out that anchovies were in Caesar salad dressing,
[365.86s -> 367.30s]  I kind of just, like, don't want it anymore.
[368.18s -> 370.18s]  That sucks, and I know. It's, like, stupid.
[370.90s -> 375.06s]  Okay, I like anchovies. I like sardines. I like fish and stuff, right?
[376.47s -> 382.15s]  But the fact that there's anchovies in a lot of, like, Caesar salad dressing,
[383.32s -> 386.76s]  it's- the combination of it kind of freaks me out for some reason, even if I know it's good.
[387.40s -> 392.70s]  Like, if you put Caesar salad dressing without the anchovies here,
[393.34s -> 399.34s]  and you put an anchovy here, I would be okay with dipping the anchovy
[399.34s -> 401.26s]  in the Caesar dressing and eating it.
[401.26s -> 403.58s]  But the combination to me is like, oh, I don't know about that.
[404.97s -> 408.25s]  I don't know. Maybe I should bring that up to the doctor next time I see him.
[413.75s -> 417.56s]  All right, ready? Why does it matter?
[417.56s -> 419.80s]  It doesn't. And I still eat it. Look, okay.
[419.80s -> 422.12s]  I gotta- I gotta clarify some things with some people here.
[422.68s -> 426.20s]  I think there's people here that think that because I- like, ovens freak me out,
[426.76s -> 429.32s]  that, like, I've never cooked in an oven in my entire life,
[429.32s -> 432.68s]  and all my food, like, comes out of the fucking, like, of a bag in the refrigerator.
[433.40s -> 434.84s]  No, I still- I use the oven.
[436.38s -> 439.82s]  When I- when I talk about, like, the microwave being something that freaks me out,
[439.82s -> 443.90s]  I- it's not like I hear the microwave turn on and, like, put up, like-
[443.90s -> 447.18s]  like, run into, like, a room and, like, hide in the corner and go, like,
[447.18s -> 448.94s]  Turn it off! Turn off the microwave!
[449.90s -> 452.46s]  I still use it. It's just kind of a weird device. It's easy.
[455.74s -> 463.70s]  He's an admitted oven user.
[463.70s -> 465.06s]  Why does it freak you out?
[465.06s -> 468.10s]  It's weird. It's like radio waves making your food hot.
[468.10s -> 472.02s]  It's weird. I- I use it- I used it literally, like, 12 hours ago.
[472.02s -> 473.06s]  But it's a weird device.
[475.38s -> 479.54s]  All right, what was I doing in my, uh, game of the year 20- what year is it? 2022.
[480.60s -> 483.64s]  It's not a radio wave, it's a microwave. Whatever the- I don't- it doesn't matter.
[483.64s -> 484.60s]  Still the same weirdness.
[488.17s -> 490.09s]  I'm not gonna get into this again because people will just leave.
[491.05s -> 494.09s]  All right, so what was I doing? Oh, yeah, I forgot. I was going this way.
[495.53s -> 496.65s]  I was exploring a little.
[497.98s -> 501.66s]  The magical world of, uh, Lindgrave.
[505.18s -> 508.54s]  I did see that they made a post about all the PC problems.
[509.10s -> 511.38s]  I saw how they were saying,
[511.38s -> 514.42s]  Oh, hey, yeah, we're aware that, like, the frame drops kind of fuck everything up.
[515.22s -> 519.22s]  And, like, especially the big and bold, bright, bright green text.
[519.94s -> 526.02s]  We are very aware of, uh, of Dodge not registering on some German 985 PC computers.
[526.74s -> 528.10s]  We're gonna address this immediately.
[528.74s -> 531.78s]  So I'm really, truly- I'm glad that they actually, you know, addressed it.
[533.21s -> 534.57s]  But actually, they are talking about it.
[535.38s -> 539.32s]  So, um, all right, I forgot that guy was even there.
[540.41s -> 541.61s]  I gotta get back in the swing of things.
[542.25s -> 546.20s]  So what's down here?
[546.20s -> 548.79s]  A bunch of explosive shit.
[548.79s -> 550.15s]  This is gonna be such a pain in the ass.
[550.71s -> 558.18s]  They're all gonna throw shit at me and it's gonna be annoying.
[559.82s -> 561.34s]  My hands are already sweating.
[561.34s -> 562.46s]  I didn't even do anything.
[562.46s -> 565.18s]  You know, no, I think this is sweat that's been here since last night.
[566.28s -> 567.64s]  As disgusting as that is.
[567.64s -> 569.56s]  I actually think I- because I just picked up, like, a-
[569.56s -> 571.32s]  Like, it's like the controller had olive oil on it.
[571.88s -> 576.63s]  I think this has just been here because I didn't, like, I didn't clean it.
[577.99s -> 584.66s]  Watch out for the dive.
[585.62s -> 590.62s]  What the fuck? Clean it.
[590.62s -> 591.90s]  It's- I- it's fine.
[591.90s -> 593.66s]  Actually, it's- it's really not fine.
[593.66s -> 596.54s]  I'm actually probably gonna have to wipe it down with this.
[596.54s -> 598.56s]  We're good.
[599.10s -> 601.54s]  Danger clothes.
[602.82s -> 604.98s]  I'm wearing completely different clothes than yesterday.
[608.90s -> 609.86s]  Controller Andy.
[613.83s -> 615.99s]  How do you- how do you play these games?
[615.99s -> 616.63s]  What's going on?
[618.81s -> 622.25s]  Playing with controller is how- like, the way you play these games.
[622.25s -> 624.65s]  Playing with the keyboard and mouse is- is hard mode.
[624.65s -> 625.45s]  That's hard mode.
[626.09s -> 631.40s]  Keyboard, mouse, with- what?
[633.40s -> 636.20s]  That's what- actually, I would call that way too hard mode.
[640.65s -> 641.69s]  That's not even hard mode.
[643.85s -> 645.53s]  Okay, so we're keeping going here.
[645.53s -> 646.57s]  Make sure I check for items.
[647.61s -> 650.41s]  Remember, you're epic and you make me LOL.
[651.05s -> 656.84s]  All right, so I'm just gonna throw, like, a grenade down here, right?
[657.40s -> 669.14s]  Wait, that was a pretty view.
[669.14s -> 669.78s]  Let me look at it.
[672.74s -> 673.70s]  Nice.
[673.70s -> 674.42s]  Really nice.
[676.63s -> 678.55s]  That looks like- I thought that was a Statue of Liberty.
[679.11s -> 680.68s]  I was like, that's kind of weird.
[681.24s -> 683.75s]  You should jump off.
[684.39s -> 686.95s]  I'm not gonna jump off.
[687.83s -> 688.47s]  Same joke?
[689.19s -> 694.15s]  Elden Ring takes place in New York.
[694.87s -> 698.90s]  Can you imagine just walking around and it's like,
[698.90s -> 700.50s]  oh, look at this beautiful castle.
[700.50s -> 701.30s]  It's so nice.
[701.30s -> 704.50s]  And you just- you just hear, like, ambient audio of, like-
[714.18s -> 715.14s]  That'd actually be kind of funny.
[721.83s -> 722.63s]  Oh, thank you.
[723.51s -> 725.88s]  Good try, though.
[729.02s -> 734.76s]  And- not just the cars, but for, like, every- hold on.
[734.76s -> 736.78s]  Let me- let me- let me just, like-
[740.34s -> 743.22s]  Quintessential city background audio is not even cars.
[743.86s -> 751.86s]  It's- with a little bit of an echo in the distance, like, every eight minutes.
[753.08s -> 755.08s]  It's just, like, the truck backing up sound.
[755.64s -> 759.90s]  Just that, like,
[767.88s -> 769.24s]  It wakes me up every morning.
[770.20s -> 771.00s]  Yeah.
[771.00s -> 775.46s]  This truck- A truck is backing up and you wonder,
[776.18s -> 779.30s]  man, that- wow, that truck's doing a lot of work.
[779.30s -> 779.86s]  No, bro.
[779.86s -> 783.22s]  That's, like, a hundred different trucks in different places.
[785.29s -> 787.05s]  It's like, oh, that- that's- that's the same truck.
[787.05s -> 788.41s]  They're doing a lot of work today.
[788.41s -> 790.33s]  Nope, that's, like, 5,000 trucks.
[791.13s -> 793.53s]  All in- scattered around the entire city.
[794.55s -> 795.51s]  And jackhammers?
[795.51s -> 796.01s]  Yeah.
[796.79s -> 797.67s]  Wait, did I miss anything here?
[798.39s -> 800.89s]  No, it's just one truck.
[800.89s -> 806.70s]  I always thought it was one truck, but it goes on all day
[806.70s -> 809.18s]  and it'd be like, why is the same truck backing up
[809.18s -> 810.86s]  over and over and over again in the same spot?
[811.90s -> 812.94s]  No, it's a different truck.
[817.66s -> 818.22s]  All right.
[818.30s -> 822.58s]  Why does it keep leaning in?
[824.02s -> 824.66s]  I'm a weirdo.
[824.66s -> 826.18s]  I don't know, like, somebody was saying yesterday,
[826.18s -> 827.30s]  and I looked at the VOD.
[827.94s -> 829.94s]  They were like, dude, you would probably be playing this game
[829.94s -> 833.30s]  five times better if you stopped dodging with the guy on screen.
[834.47s -> 839.26s]  And it's just like, you know, that's just what- I can't help it.
[839.26s -> 840.78s]  I actually can't help doing that.
[842.82s -> 843.70s]  It's going to happen.
[843.70s -> 845.22s]  I can't stop that from happening.
[846.94s -> 849.42s]  In fact, I don't know how people play these games just, like,
[849.42s -> 851.10s]  with a huge monster on the screen
[851.10s -> 852.70s]  and a bunch of crazy shit is happening.
[852.70s -> 858.62s]  And they're just like, like, I'm under attack.
[859.58s -> 862.30s]  You're- I'm under attack in- when this happens.
[862.30s -> 863.58s]  It's- I don't know how you stay so calm.
[870.68s -> 871.80s]  They're actual gamers.
[872.44s -> 875.86s]  Okay, I'm going to get killed out here.
[877.05s -> 878.41s]  Oh, well, all right, I can go down there.
[878.41s -> 882.62s]  Wait, let's go this way.
[882.62s -> 884.54s]  This is probably my favorite area of the game so far.
[888.70s -> 891.02s]  I could just fall- I could just go and go for it.
[892.23s -> 892.71s]  You know what I mean?
[893.43s -> 894.71s]  I could go for it right now.
[897.53s -> 898.03s]  Oh.
[905.06s -> 905.70s]  What's down here?
[910.50s -> 911.14s]  I don't know what to do.
[911.14s -> 911.70s]  I don't know what to do.
[912.42s -> 915.77s]  I think I'm going to go with hole.
[916.41s -> 918.34s]  Yep, I'm going hole.
[919.06s -> 928.33s]  It's not going to hurt me, right?
[929.05s -> 935.72s]  Oh, shit, okay.
[936.36s -> 938.20s]  All right, so what's in here?
[939.08s -> 945.88s]  All right, I think it's an NPC right there.
[945.88s -> 948.20s]  Yeah, my voice is going to be like this for like a 15 minutes.
[949.00s -> 950.44s]  Is that an enemy or an NPC?
[951.08s -> 953.37s]  An NPC.
[953.37s -> 954.17s]  All right, what do you got to say?
[954.97s -> 957.16s]  Nice to meet you.
[957.72s -> 958.84s]  The pleasure's mine.
[958.84s -> 960.33s]  Roger is the name.
[960.97s -> 961.61s]  A sorcerer.
[961.61s -> 963.05s]  That's like a mushroom hat.
[963.05s -> 963.85s]  You might have guessed.
[963.85s -> 964.49s]  Sorcerer!
[964.49s -> 967.69s]  I'm looking for a little something here in the castle.
[967.69s -> 970.63s]  I'm not hot-footing it from the troops, that is.
[970.63s -> 971.67s]  But enough about me.
[972.79s -> 974.95s]  What are you doing here in Stormvale Castle?
[976.07s -> 976.95s]  Sorcerer's Sue.
[976.95s -> 977.91s]  Oh, boy.
[977.91s -> 978.47s]  That's bad.
[979.27s -> 982.63s]  They sacrifice our kind for grafting.
[982.63s -> 986.63s]  Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind.
[986.63s -> 987.35s]  Does he got, um...
[988.23s -> 989.67s]  I'm here to defeat Godric.
[990.63s -> 991.35s]  Did I say?
[992.07s -> 992.87s]  What if he's a friend?
[992.87s -> 994.31s]  What if he's friends with Godric?
[998.66s -> 999.78s]  I'm here to defeat Godric.
[999.78s -> 1000.26s]  I see.
[1000.90s -> 1005.24s]  Here to challenge Godric and lay your hands upon a grave.
[1005.24s -> 1006.60s]  You can see it then.
[1006.60s -> 1007.56s]  I take it.
[1007.56s -> 1009.13s]  The guidance of grace.
[1009.77s -> 1010.49s]  Well...
[1010.49s -> 1012.73s]  You're the only person that's doing a magic build, and I love it.
[1012.73s -> 1014.33s]  I'm tarnished, like you.
[1014.97s -> 1015.05s]  But...
[1015.05s -> 1016.41s]  I think there's other people doing it.
[1016.41s -> 1017.21s]  I've seen neither...
[1017.21s -> 1018.25s]  I'm not a pure caster, though.
[1018.25s -> 1019.85s]  ... this guidance for the longest time.
[1020.57s -> 1025.34s]  Still, won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.
[1025.98s -> 1028.54s]  I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.
[1029.10s -> 1030.70s]  Would you care to learn one?
[1030.70s -> 1034.46s]  As a fellow tarnished, once guided by grace, I'd love to...
[1034.46s -> 1035.34s]  Magical battle art?
[1035.34s -> 1036.54s]  Oh my god, this could change everything.
[1037.50s -> 1038.56s]  Yeah.
[1039.02s -> 1046.68s]  Grants affinities and skills to an...
[1046.68s -> 1047.48s]  Wait, what does this do?
[1048.68s -> 1053.85s]  The ash of war grants an armament of the magic affinity and the following skill.
[1053.85s -> 1055.05s]  Spinning weapon.
[1055.05s -> 1057.85s]  Defensive skill employed by carrion princesses.
[1060.47s -> 1065.03s]  Lifts armament into the midair that makes it spin violently.
[1065.03s -> 1067.83s]  Those it touches will suffer a successive attack.
[1067.83s -> 1070.22s]  Useful on small...
[1070.22s -> 1072.70s]  Okay, so this is like a magical spinning blade?
[1073.96s -> 1074.92s]  Ahem.
[1074.92s -> 1079.26s]  Carrion royal prestige embodying a skill.
[1079.26s -> 1081.26s]  Transform blade into a magical greatsword.
[1081.26s -> 1082.30s]  Oh, it's the swing.
[1082.30s -> 1083.18s]  The magic swing.
[1083.18s -> 1083.68s]  Ooh.
[1084.46s -> 1088.34s]  Linestone pebble.
[1088.34s -> 1089.06s]  I already have this, though.
[1090.10s -> 1097.91s]  Wait, what?
[1097.91s -> 1098.39s]  Wait.
[1098.39s -> 1101.67s]  This is a weapon art version of the one I already have.
[1102.87s -> 1105.93s]  I think I want this.
[1105.93s -> 1106.81s]  Yeah, I want this one.
[1107.45s -> 1109.78s]  All right, I gotta remember where this guy is.
[1111.27s -> 1111.99s]  I will forget.
[1111.99s -> 1113.35s]  You fucking bet your ass I will.
[1114.07s -> 1115.11s]  I gotta get rid of the other ones.
[1115.11s -> 1115.75s]  Look at all these.
[1115.75s -> 1116.07s]  Yeah.
[1116.07s -> 1117.19s]  I got so much shit on the map.
[1117.83s -> 1121.67s]  Because they're the markers.
[1121.67s -> 1126.42s]  Is that one there?
[1128.12s -> 1128.60s]  Okay, yeah.
[1128.60s -> 1129.56s]  I gotta remember where he is.
[1130.20s -> 1133.30s]  For me, you're gonna mold hard in about 30 minutes.
[1134.42s -> 1138.18s]  You know, you could probably say that at any timestamp in this whole stream,
[1138.18s -> 1138.98s]  and you'd probably...
[1138.98s -> 1139.54s]  You'd be right.
[1140.34s -> 1142.90s]  You'd be close enough, probably, I would assume.
[1142.90s -> 1144.02s]  Put it on the notepad?
[1145.94s -> 1146.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[1146.66s -> 1147.62s]  That's actually true.
[1148.34s -> 1148.90s]  Very true.
[1150.95s -> 1151.45s]  Okay.
[1160.86s -> 1161.80s]  At...
[1161.80s -> 1162.84s]  At one.
[1162.84s -> 1168.10s]  At waypoint one has new spells.
[1169.06s -> 1170.14s]  All right, that's good.
[1170.78s -> 1174.14s]  I have to be careful.
[1174.14s -> 1175.10s]  I don't want to hit him.
[1175.10s -> 1175.60s]  Okay, good.
[1176.86s -> 1177.50s]  All right.
[1177.50s -> 1178.38s]  So that's where he is.
[1178.38s -> 1178.94s]  I gotta remember...
[1178.94s -> 1180.78s]  Wait, where's the marker?
[1180.78s -> 1185.80s]  Oh, the marker go away.
[1185.80s -> 1186.12s]  All right.
[1186.12s -> 1187.08s]  Sorcerer in there.
[1187.72s -> 1193.67s]  Can you imagine if this was the game facts for this?
[1193.67s -> 1199.64s]  This is my game facts for Elden Ring.
[1202.12s -> 1202.92s]  Full walkthrough.
[1204.31s -> 1206.39s]  Door next to spawn is blocked shut.
[1207.38s -> 1210.90s]  Two stone sword key gargoyle statue at tutorial zone bonfire.
[1211.83s -> 1215.11s]  Looking for Lanius sent back to main character of anime.
[1215.11s -> 1218.73s]  Winstone key for sorcerer guy and to open CL2 academy.
[1218.73s -> 1222.42s]  Buster pat sorcerer at waypoint one has new spells.
[1222.42s -> 1224.15s]  I'm just starting to do auto.
[1233.53s -> 1235.45s]  These are dog notes.
[1235.45s -> 1240.01s]  If auto knew how to read and write, this is how he would do it.
[1247.42s -> 1247.98s]  What about in here?
[1259.77s -> 1260.97s]  Would the guy in front of him hear this?
[1264.54s -> 1265.50s]  Gorsh, I hope not.
[1276.01s -> 1277.29s]  You got bombs, dude.
[1277.29s -> 1277.85s]  Okay, run.
[1293.77s -> 1294.57s]  Trying to hit them both.
[1295.13s -> 1295.77s]  What did I just hit?
[1295.77s -> 1296.41s]  I hit something else?
[1297.13s -> 1299.11s]  Were there two people sitting in the corner?
[1304.42s -> 1305.14s]  Oh, I didn't get...
[1305.86s -> 1308.28s]  This is bad.
[1308.28s -> 1309.85s]  This is bad.
[1309.85s -> 1310.49s]  This is really bad.
[1311.53s -> 1312.73s]  Yeah, okay.
[1314.46s -> 1315.26s]  I hit left.
[1316.06s -> 1317.26s]  This is why, like, okay.
[1320.41s -> 1325.21s]  Hitting left on the D-pad to get the sorcerer stick in order to do the parry.
[1325.21s -> 1325.85s]  I would have hit it.
[1328.25s -> 1330.49s]  It's like I have four fucking items.
[1330.49s -> 1332.17s]  I feel like...
[1334.54s -> 1335.74s]  Not gonna get it.
[1335.74s -> 1338.06s]  It's been 10 minutes, so you were wrong, by 20 minutes.
[1345.64s -> 1347.48s]  Just two guys sleeping in the corner.
[1350.54s -> 1350.86s]  What?
[1352.82s -> 1356.66s]  Did they increase the hitboxes in these games by, like, 500,000%?
[1361.03s -> 1367.35s]  I feel like an action happens here and in, like, a four-mile radius it actually hits.
[1378.58s -> 1383.14s]  Like, that beaked motherfucker right there threw a bomb at me
[1383.70s -> 1386.74s]  and it hit two other people in other games that are not even here.
[1395.53s -> 1396.49s]  Just kill me.
[1396.49s -> 1398.09s]  Alright, I'm shooting this guy from far away.
[1398.65s -> 1414.26s]  Somebody got punched in the face in that top tower and my neck started to hurt.
[1417.64s -> 1419.48s]  Okay, give me my sorcerer's abilities.
[1420.12s -> 1422.15s]  Oh, hi.
[1422.15s -> 1423.03s]  I can do it too, you know.
[1432.39s -> 1434.95s]  Really utilizing, like, the exploding barrels.
[1438.01s -> 1438.73s]  The barrels.
[1438.73s -> 1439.45s]  Barrels everywhere.
[1439.45s -> 1440.41s]  There's barrels everywhere.
[1440.41s -> 1441.53s]  I lost the souls that I had.
[1441.53s -> 1442.73s]  Thanks a lot, Donkey Kong.
[1468.26s -> 1468.74s]  Watch out.
[1469.86s -> 1470.66s]  This is so far away.
[1470.66s -> 1472.18s]  I was probably so close to a bonfire too.
[1472.18s -> 1472.90s]  That's so annoying.
[1477.67s -> 1477.91s]  Oh.
[1483.67s -> 1483.91s]  Oh.
[1486.26s -> 1486.98s]  Alright.
[1486.98s -> 1492.79s]  He's my favorite Sonic character.
[1498.57s -> 1499.85s]  Who cares?
[1499.85s -> 1500.65s]  Who cares?
[1501.53s -> 1503.13s]  Stop asking questions like that.
[1504.01s -> 1504.89s]  Who gives a shit?
[1506.09s -> 1506.97s]  It's fucking...
[1506.97s -> 1508.57s]  It's Tails, I guess.
[1508.57s -> 1509.05s]  I don't know.
[1521.43s -> 1522.87s]  You know why it's Tails?
[1522.87s -> 1524.57s]  Here's why it's Tails.
[1526.25s -> 1528.57s]  You don't have any responsibility as Tails.
[1528.57s -> 1528.89s]  Zero.
[1530.87s -> 1534.23s]  Your friend gets to be the one that makes all the fucking wrong decisions
[1534.23s -> 1535.35s]  while you just float around.
[1536.79s -> 1539.67s]  So it was awesome when somebody wanted to play Sonic.
[1539.67s -> 1541.51s]  Because I would always pick Tails.
[1541.51s -> 1544.79s]  Because I knew that that idiot that missed the jump,
[1544.79s -> 1545.99s]  I was just kind of hanging out.
[1556.68s -> 1557.64s]  Always player two.
[1558.36s -> 1564.14s]  Yeah, Tails was the equivalent of what they did in Mario Galaxy.
[1564.78s -> 1567.40s]  Where you could give somebody else the controller
[1567.40s -> 1569.72s]  and they could just be a little pink star on the screen
[1569.72s -> 1571.00s]  and collect items for you.
[1572.52s -> 1573.64s]  That's Tails.
[1573.64s -> 1574.52s]  That's what Tails was.
[1575.32s -> 1578.50s]  You're at 100 deaths?
[1579.14s -> 1582.42s]  Okay, I need to pay attention.
[1582.42s -> 1582.74s]  No more...
[1584.82s -> 1585.86s]  I'm not speaking ever again.
[1600.01s -> 1600.25s]  Okay.
[1603.37s -> 1603.93s]  So there you go.
[1603.93s -> 1606.33s]  But the answer is that actually he's probably big the cat
[1606.33s -> 1607.77s]  because he's the one with the fishing pole, right?
[1608.57s -> 1609.66s]  So that's kind of cool.
[1616.39s -> 1617.11s]  Alright, keep going.
[1621.67s -> 1622.39s]  I do, okay?
[1623.19s -> 1625.34s]  I didn't even need to go up there.
[1625.34s -> 1626.30s]  That was such a waste of time.
[1626.30s -> 1627.26s]  Alright, no more fucking around.
[1627.98s -> 1633.10s]  It wasn't really worth coming here,
[1633.10s -> 1634.06s]  but this looks like it can break.
[1635.18s -> 1643.53s]  Oh, nothing.
[1643.53s -> 1651.50s]  Okay, this is just the same place that I was.
[1652.30s -> 1654.28s]  This horse first guy is right there.
[1654.28s -> 1657.21s]  Why stop getting rid of my shit?
[1662.84s -> 1665.38s]  Um, this looks...
[1665.38s -> 1668.34s]  Okay, this is like a hand with like a magical spell on it.
[1668.34s -> 1669.14s]  So that's what I'm going to say.
[1669.86s -> 1677.45s]  Have you tried the McPlant?
[1677.45s -> 1678.41s]  Is it in America yet?
[1679.13s -> 1679.93s]  I don't think so.
[1687.48s -> 1689.00s]  By the way, you're a McPlant.
[1689.56s -> 1692.47s]  Is there no way you don't work for that company?
[1692.47s -> 1698.58s]  I don't know.
[1698.58s -> 1698.90s]  Oh, man.
[1708.52s -> 1709.72s]  I fucking love McDonald's.
[1709.72s -> 1710.12s]  I'm kidding.
[1711.75s -> 1712.47s]  I haven't tried it yet.
[1712.47s -> 1712.87s]  No, no.
[1715.42s -> 1717.42s]  I'm really spicy this morning.
[1717.42s -> 1719.10s]  Yeah, it's four o'clock in the afternoon.
[1719.10s -> 1719.42s]  I know.
[1722.28s -> 1723.16s]  Okay, these two...
[1725.45s -> 1726.41s]  I got to...
[1726.41s -> 1733.66s]  It's going to come down to catching them off guard
[1733.66s -> 1736.22s]  and just doing cast, cast, cast, cast, cast, cast,
[1736.22s -> 1737.34s]  and get them in like a bowling pin.
[1737.90s -> 1738.62s]  Let's play bowling.
[1752.63s -> 1753.03s]  What?
[1755.10s -> 1755.58s]  No way.
[1756.46s -> 1758.95s]  Third time's the charm.
[1781.40s -> 1782.04s]  Huh?
[1782.04s -> 1782.44s]  What?
[1782.44s -> 1783.16s]  Where were we?
[1783.72s -> 1785.53s]  Did I fall through the map?
[1786.73s -> 1788.09s]  I fell through the fucking map?
[1788.98s -> 1789.30s]  What?
[1791.75s -> 1792.47s]  Where were we?
[1793.19s -> 1796.06s]  What happened?
[1796.86s -> 1798.71s]  All right, fuck this.
[1802.12s -> 1803.16s]  Okay, I could probably make it.
[1804.04s -> 1804.84s]  I just wanted to skip it.
[1804.84s -> 1805.64s]  I can definitely make it.
[1806.20s -> 1809.50s]  I know backing up in From Software Games
[1809.50s -> 1811.98s]  is like digging straight up in Minecraft.
[1811.98s -> 1813.98s]  I know, but like sometimes you have to do it.
[1813.98s -> 1814.86s]  Otherwise, what am I going to do?
[1815.50s -> 1827.88s]  Dude, I can absolutely make that.
[1827.88s -> 1829.00s]  There's no way I can.
[1829.00s -> 1829.80s]  I just have to get a little...
[1829.80s -> 1830.68s]  I've got to go to the corner.
[1834.17s -> 1834.73s]  Use the horse?
[1841.72s -> 1842.60s]  I can't use the horse here.
[1843.16s -> 1846.06s]  The horse is banned in Stormvale Castle.
[1846.06s -> 1846.62s]  Let me just make sure.
[1846.62s -> 1847.18s]  Let me take a look.
[1847.74s -> 1851.10s]  I actually think this is possible.
[1854.60s -> 1855.24s]  Right there.
[1855.24s -> 1855.72s]  See what I mean?
[1856.60s -> 1857.16s]  I think it is.
[1857.88s -> 1860.42s]  All right, it's not possible.
[1860.42s -> 1861.46s]  Fucking whatever.
[1861.46s -> 1862.42s]  It might be, but I'm not going to...
[1863.46s -> 1868.74s]  You need to run jump.
[1868.74s -> 1870.58s]  It's hard to do, though, because you have to hold B.
[1871.62s -> 1873.62s]  And if you touch B too early, you just dodge.
[1874.26s -> 1876.50s]  So it's like you don't...
[1876.50s -> 1877.38s]  There might not be enough time.
[1878.02s -> 1884.31s]  It's my last try.
[1888.20s -> 1888.92s]  Oh, it's possible.
[1888.92s -> 1889.48s]  Oh, yeah. Okay.
[1890.58s -> 1891.30s]  All right, it's possible.
[1892.82s -> 1899.62s]  I just had to go a little bit more to the right.
[1900.18s -> 1901.86s]  That skips that whole area too, so that's perfect.
[1904.86s -> 1907.50s]  Okay, but counting these deaths as deaths is like...
[1908.14s -> 1910.70s]  I'm experimenting with what I can do in the world.
[1911.34s -> 1913.59s]  So I need to go like here.
[1913.59s -> 1915.19s]  Like right to the left of the pillar there.
[1919.14s -> 1919.46s]  Got it.
[1919.46s -> 1922.60s]  Okay.
[1922.60s -> 1926.02s]  Now, what is that?
[1926.58s -> 1939.06s]  Okay, so I can drop down there and just kind of go that way with these guys are going.
[1939.06s -> 1942.10s]  I can skip those guys entirely too, which I don't need to fight everything.
[1942.74s -> 1947.62s]  What's down there?
[1947.62s -> 1948.12s]  Whoa.
[1948.66s -> 1953.96s]  I mean, I kind of want to see what that is.
[1954.68s -> 1955.99s]  What is that?
[1956.47s -> 1960.02s]  Holy shit.
[1960.02s -> 1960.26s]  All right.
[1960.26s -> 1961.14s]  I'm going to go see what that is.
[1973.58s -> 1974.30s]  Oh, what?
[1975.86s -> 1977.30s]  I don't think I have one.
[1977.30s -> 1999.10s]  What's it called?
[1999.10s -> 1999.66s]  Storm...
[1999.66s -> 2001.10s]  Stone sword, not storm sword.
[2001.66s -> 2005.59s]  I'm going to abbreviate this.
[2005.59s -> 2006.39s]  SS key.
[2007.27s -> 2012.89s]  How many keys does it need?
[2015.03s -> 2015.59s]  Good question.
[2017.74s -> 2019.34s]  I don't want to spend them, but how much does it need?
[2021.85s -> 2022.73s]  No, it doesn't say.
[2023.29s -> 2024.10s]  Okay.
[2024.10s -> 2024.74s]  Well, here we are.
[2025.38s -> 2029.90s]  I mean, there's obviously something's going to happen here.
[2030.46s -> 2033.85s]  There's no way...
[2033.85s -> 2034.81s]  Okay, just be ready.
[2034.81s -> 2038.09s]  Be prepared because there's no way that like five people don't jump down after I touch this.
[2038.81s -> 2040.50s]  It's too perfect of a spot.
[2041.14s -> 2048.28s]  In fact, smothering stone?
[2052.70s -> 2053.82s]  No, really?
[2053.82s -> 2065.43s]  What the fuck is that?
[2067.88s -> 2069.24s]  I can't go anywhere.
[2069.24s -> 2070.20s]  I'm stuck down here.
[2075.21s -> 2076.89s]  Is that his back or his front?
[2076.89s -> 2077.45s]  I don't know.
[2079.42s -> 2082.86s]  Is he looking away from me or is he facing this way?
[2085.03s -> 2085.75s]  Oh shit.
[2091.80s -> 2092.68s]  Oh, that's his front.
[2092.68s -> 2093.24s]  That's his front.
[2093.24s -> 2093.74s]  Okay.
[2094.28s -> 2117.51s]  I don't think I'm supposed to be here, but give me all the stuff in your house.
[2118.39s -> 2123.80s]  I don't know what that was, but it's mine now.
[2141.22s -> 2141.72s]  Oh.
[2153.64s -> 2154.44s]  Oh, no.
[2156.18s -> 2157.14s]  Don't call me.
[2157.14s -> 2158.90s]  Don't call me a Cheez-It.
[2158.90s -> 2160.02s]  Don't call me a Cheez-It.
[2160.90s -> 2162.50s]  I mean, you can, but you don't.
[2164.62s -> 2165.42s]  I can't Cheez-It.
[2166.22s -> 2167.98s]  He's too quick and I can't shoot him through the door.
[2168.54s -> 2175.26s]  Oh, yeah, I can.
[2181.72s -> 2182.60s]  Oh, that's some...
[2182.60s -> 2186.44s]  That is some pure Gruyere cheese, if I don't say so myself.
[2188.10s -> 2190.10s]  Absolute pure delicious Gruyere.
[2193.58s -> 2194.46s]  Come on.
[2194.46s -> 2195.42s]  Come on.
[2195.42s -> 2198.14s]  You're dealing with a casual right now.
[2198.22s -> 2198.72s]  Huh?
[2199.02s -> 2215.90s]  Do not say that.
[2215.90s -> 2216.78s]  Do not say that.
[2216.78s -> 2217.28s]  Casual.
[2220.20s -> 2222.36s]  He almost took my fucking hand clean off my shoulders.
[2223.00s -> 2225.16s]  All right, just come over here so I can fucking...
[2225.16s -> 2226.36s]  Oh, that's...
[2226.36s -> 2227.56s]  No, that's a really good Brie.
[2228.52s -> 2229.02s]  No more.
[2230.18s -> 2231.46s]  Why am I losing walk-on?
[2234.23s -> 2235.67s]  I'm so good at fucking video games, man.
[2236.47s -> 2239.18s]  That's it?
[2239.18s -> 2244.20s]  Be careful, that guy killed me through a wall.
[2244.20s -> 2244.70s]  Yeah.
[2247.42s -> 2249.74s]  Look, I am a battle mage.
[2251.30s -> 2257.06s]  I have this claw, which attacks, but I also have the staff, which attacks.
[2258.70s -> 2259.66s]  You're a bimbo.
[2262.97s -> 2265.37s]  I'm playing the bimbo build.
[2265.37s -> 2266.33s]  Is that what you're telling me?
[2266.97s -> 2269.50s]  Is this bimbo build?
[2271.00s -> 2271.48s]  Wait, what?
[2271.48s -> 2276.60s]  Like, I get to hang back and cast spells and only need to use my weapon if I absolutely need to?
[2285.32s -> 2285.88s]  Oh, okay.
[2286.52s -> 2288.20s]  I said this last night and I'll say it again.
[2288.84s -> 2292.44s]  Sorcery works really well until it doesn't.
[2293.59s -> 2297.27s]  And we might find out really soon enough here the places where it doesn't.
[2299.22s -> 2300.58s]  Oh, it's getting auto-modded.
[2303.45s -> 2305.69s]  Sorcery works great until it don't.
[2315.00s -> 2319.24s]  Sorcery is going to fall off real hard in the next probably couple of hours,
[2319.24s -> 2320.28s]  from what I've been told.
[2320.84s -> 2326.25s]  This is a cringe build.
[2326.25s -> 2329.58s]  Can we bring back the guy that said that, like,
[2329.58s -> 2331.74s]  I'm one of the only people playing a sorcery build?
[2332.30s -> 2333.18s]  Where is that person?
[2333.18s -> 2335.90s]  Can you come back and can you, like, say what you said, like, five more times?
[2343.16s -> 2347.88s]  I'm building decks and I'm building sorcery as it stands right now.
[2352.14s -> 2353.26s]  As it stands right now.
[2354.22s -> 2356.94s]  My sorcery does more damage than my dexterity attacks.
[2357.58s -> 2361.10s]  Therefore, I'm going to continue to use it until the dexterity takes it over.
[2361.10s -> 2364.50s]  The very simple equation.
[2365.06s -> 2365.86s]  Very easy.
[2365.86s -> 2366.26s]  Simple.
[2366.82s -> 2376.01s]  Can I talk?
[2376.01s -> 2378.12s]  It doesn't open from this side.
[2382.46s -> 2383.18s]  I'm in trouble here.
[2387.35s -> 2390.07s]  I think I have to sneak by this person and try to find a bonfire,
[2390.63s -> 2392.54s]  which I'm going to think is probably over there.
[2393.42s -> 2393.98s]  All right.
[2393.98s -> 2394.94s]  Two schools of thought here.
[2396.17s -> 2399.13s]  Run straight through there and just sprint into that build.
[2399.13s -> 2402.33s]  Sprint in there and just run until I find a fire or sneak around.
[2409.80s -> 2410.44s]  You think it's run?
[2411.80s -> 2412.92s]  I think it's sneak.
[2412.92s -> 2416.36s]  I'm going to wait till his back turns, but I can't run sneak because people hear it.
[2417.08s -> 2418.60s]  When he goes this way, we're going to go that way.
[2419.40s -> 2422.25s]  One, two, three.
[2422.81s -> 2437.75s]  Let's kill him.
[2441.02s -> 2441.74s]  Excuse me?
[2443.50s -> 2443.82s]  What?
[2444.78s -> 2445.58s]  You got to be kidding me.
[2445.58s -> 2446.54s]  How did he fucking hear me?
[2447.90s -> 2449.66s]  Just give me whatever's in your house quick.
[2459.66s -> 2462.46s]  Oh, fire.
[2462.46s -> 2463.18s]  Is there fire in here?
[2464.33s -> 2464.97s]  I need a fire.
[2466.42s -> 2474.63s]  Thank God he de-aggroed.
[2474.63s -> 2475.43s]  I need a fire.
[2476.07s -> 2477.99s]  Come on.
[2477.99s -> 2479.03s]  I'm so far down here.
[2482.23s -> 2483.91s]  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[2487.05s -> 2487.61s]  Fire in here?
[2491.58s -> 2491.98s]  Damn it.
[2507.00s -> 2507.88s]  Fireplace?
[2507.88s -> 2515.42s]  No, that's not what I'm saying.
[2515.42s -> 2520.22s]  I swear to God, if one of these birds drops a fucking grenade on me, I'm going to be so mad.
[2524.55s -> 2525.75s]  Where the hell am I?
[2525.75s -> 2526.47s]  Wait, what?
[2526.47s -> 2527.19s]  I went around.
[2527.19s -> 2528.31s]  Wait, where am I in a circle?
[2530.97s -> 2535.18s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[2535.18s -> 2536.46s]  I had to have missed one.
[2536.46s -> 2541.94s]  Maybe this one down over here?
[2541.94s -> 2545.34s]  I don't have enough to...
[2545.34s -> 2546.14s]  I don't have enough to...
[2546.14s -> 2547.74s]  I'm scared to attack that guy.
[2547.74s -> 2550.58s]  There's a chest over there, too.
[2551.14s -> 2555.85s]  Teleport?
[2556.49s -> 2560.25s]  Yeah, but I swear there's probably one right here somewhere.
[2562.15s -> 2562.95s]  Like, right...
[2562.95s -> 2563.83s]  Okay, look at this.
[2563.83s -> 2564.63s]  Like, where...
[2564.63s -> 2566.31s]  This spot, this one, probably right here.
[2570.01s -> 2570.73s]  Shit.
[2570.73s -> 2581.08s]  All right, well, at least I know it's not safe.
[2582.04s -> 2584.28s]  Okay, so let me...
[2584.28s -> 2587.08s]  If I go from this fire that's up here, I can just kind of...
[2587.80s -> 2588.60s]  I'll do skip.
[2588.60s -> 2590.84s]  I'll do castle skip, right?
[2590.84s -> 2591.80s]  Which will put me right here.
[2592.44s -> 2595.91s]  Yeah, and then I can level up once or twice as well.
[2598.46s -> 2600.06s]  Yeah, because castle skip puts me right here.
[2602.12s -> 2602.60s]  Wait a minute.
[2606.98s -> 2607.46s]  Where am I?
[2609.11s -> 2613.75s]  Yeah.
[2613.75s -> 2614.63s]  Why do I not heal?
[2614.63s -> 2616.31s]  I don't have any flasks left.
[2621.88s -> 2625.22s]  Okay, let me level up.
[2625.86s -> 2628.26s]  I have a lot of those crunchies, so...
[2628.98s -> 2630.02s]  I got plenty of crunchies.
[2630.74s -> 2633.50s]  I have a lot of crunchies.
[2633.50s -> 2634.22s]  Wait, that's wrong.
[2634.78s -> 2635.26s]  Here they are.
[2636.60s -> 2637.40s]  Yeah, let's use it.
[2639.37s -> 2640.73s]  I have not been using the crunchies.
[2641.37s -> 2645.77s]  What do I need?
[2650.55s -> 2652.07s]  3,600.
[2652.07s -> 2659.08s]  I think I have a big one.
[2659.80s -> 2660.68s]  Gain ruins.
[2660.68s -> 2661.64s]  All right, let's take this one.
[2662.44s -> 2667.21s]  All right, that'll get me to 3,900.
[2667.21s -> 2668.09s]  What do I need after that?
[2677.38s -> 2681.22s]  Either intelligence or endurance.
[2683.58s -> 2685.50s]  How are you liking Soulcalibur?
[2686.46s -> 2687.02s]  It's pretty good.
[2691.14s -> 2693.62s]  What is, in your opinion, the most clusterfuck of a stream you've ever done?
[2693.62s -> 2695.62s]  The family dinner stream, without a doubt.
[2700.02s -> 2700.50s]  Strength.
[2701.98s -> 2704.70s]  I don't really want to do strength until I need it,
[2704.70s -> 2706.54s]  but I probably will soon here, right?
[2708.92s -> 2711.56s]  I imagine that very soon, even a deck scaling weapon,
[2711.56s -> 2713.64s]  I'm gonna have to have at least probably 12 to 15 strength.
[2719.77s -> 2720.65s]  And it's cheap now.
[2724.22s -> 2727.77s]  But I think I want some more endurance.
[2727.77s -> 2734.25s]  I'll get intelligence to 18.
[2734.25s -> 2736.31s]  And then...
[2737.19s -> 2738.23s]  Actually, I might be able to do it right now.
[2738.87s -> 2743.42s]  Yeah, I definitely will.
[2743.42s -> 2745.50s]  Yeah, this is gonna get me to at least probably 3 or 4,000.
[2749.72s -> 2750.12s]  Shit.
[2750.12s -> 2750.84s]  Okay, it's all right.
[2752.18s -> 2754.18s]  All right, so now from here, I gotta do...
[2754.18s -> 2755.38s]  Wait, how much is this one?
[2755.38s -> 2755.86s]  None.
[2755.86s -> 2758.57s]  All right, so here we are.
[2758.57s -> 2760.65s]  So right there, I just do castle skip.
[2760.65s -> 2762.09s]  Right here, and I'm back to where I was.
[2762.81s -> 2769.03s]  Holy shit, that was almost a disaster.
[2769.03s -> 2770.79s]  Okay, so now we go this way.
[2776.25s -> 2777.77s]  And this is exactly where I just was.
[2778.49s -> 2779.93s]  So now I'm in a better position.
[2780.65s -> 2782.49s]  Let's do some exploration.
[2782.49s -> 2785.45s]  But first, I want to go down here because there's an item down here.
[2786.01s -> 2786.94s]  Where was it?
[2787.58s -> 2788.81s]  It was...
[2788.81s -> 2789.37s]  Where was it?
[2789.37s -> 2790.09s]  I asked a question.
[2798.38s -> 2800.30s]  You don't even have 5 seconds to respond.
[2802.18s -> 2802.82s]  Okay, here we go.
[2803.38s -> 2804.82s]  I'm gonna go in here and kill this guy,
[2805.77s -> 2807.85s]  because I have to be a video game player.
[2809.00s -> 2811.96s]  And these guys are hard to play against.
[2812.52s -> 2813.08s]  I need to play...
[2813.08s -> 2813.88s]  Here it is, right here.
[2814.44s -> 2816.33s]  I gotta kill this guy.
[2817.21s -> 2817.77s]  There's no...
[2818.65s -> 2820.07s]  Are we gonna cheese him?
[2842.26s -> 2842.90s]  Ah!
[2842.90s -> 2845.30s]  Dude, fuck.
[2845.30s -> 2845.62s]  God.
[2848.89s -> 2851.53s]  I hate these like long-winded swings.
[2852.17s -> 2856.89s]  When somebody swings a weapon at you,
[2856.89s -> 2858.97s]  and normally, it's just like, here it comes, right?
[2859.86s -> 2861.86s]  Well, when they do these little like crow hop moves,
[2861.86s -> 2862.90s]  where they're like, here it comes.
[2865.40s -> 2866.12s]  And then I'm doing it.
[2867.00s -> 2877.96s]  Oh, and by the way, it's gonna be a 360 degree tornado spin too.
[2879.37s -> 2880.73s]  Don't miss this jump, please.
[2880.73s -> 2880.97s]  Okay.
[2882.63s -> 2884.71s]  That was 3,000 souls I would have lost.
[2884.71s -> 2885.27s]  I'm fine.
[2885.27s -> 2890.49s]  Everybody relax.
[2890.49s -> 2892.09s]  You're calling this guy the fuck out, man.
[2893.85s -> 2894.89s]  He's like a streamer?
[2896.86s -> 2898.78s]  Yeah, I mean, it's like fucking bullshit.
[2898.78s -> 2900.46s]  The guy like does these dumb shitty tactics
[2900.46s -> 2902.22s]  when he plays PvP, and it's annoying.
[2902.22s -> 2903.58s]  Like, what do you mean, calling him out?
[2922.17s -> 2923.37s]  He definitely saw that.
[2927.61s -> 2929.53s]  I need to get a backstab on him.
[2929.53s -> 2931.88s]  And I should have had it the first time,
[2931.88s -> 2933.88s]  but I apparently didn't for some reason.
[2933.88s -> 2937.74s]  He turns back around this way.
[2937.74s -> 2938.86s]  Yeah, he walks back this way.
[2938.86s -> 2939.50s]  Okay, here we go.
[2939.50s -> 2941.42s]  I'm gonna get the backstab, and I'm gonna kick his ass.
[2942.06s -> 2959.05s]  You see how long that move was?
[2971.16s -> 2972.28s]  What the fuck has happened?
[2972.84s -> 2974.20s]  That was crazy.
[2974.20s -> 2980.33s]  Where did my souls go?
[2981.99s -> 2982.55s]  Hey, wait.
[2985.22s -> 2986.34s]  Didn't I have like 3,000?
[2986.98s -> 2990.39s]  What happened to them?
[2990.39s -> 2994.36s]  You picked them up.
[2994.36s -> 2998.04s]  Yeah, but I thought I had like already had 2,900.
[2998.04s -> 2999.88s]  And you have 3k.
[2999.88s -> 3000.76s]  Why are some of them gone?
[3001.78s -> 3002.90s]  It's the cheese tax.
[3003.54s -> 3012.30s]  I think you still lose some when you die, do you?
[3012.30s -> 3012.78s]  That's new.
[3015.77s -> 3019.77s]  Wait, I swear to God, I thought I had like 2,800 or something.
[3020.41s -> 3023.53s]  After killing that guy, I don't know.
[3023.53s -> 3023.93s]  That's weird.
[3024.65s -> 3025.21s]  Oh, you map.
[3031.38s -> 3032.50s]  It was the cheese tax.
[3033.38s -> 3037.27s]  Okay, so there's got to be a way to go from here over there.
[3038.38s -> 3039.02s]  Yeah.
[3039.02s -> 3044.26s]  I mean, it's not that way because that's where the...
[3044.26s -> 3044.98s]  I don't want to fight this guy.
[3044.98s -> 3045.38s]  I don't care.
[3046.26s -> 3049.48s]  Where was that door?
[3050.68s -> 3051.00s]  Really?
[3058.17s -> 3059.05s]  Cheese tax.
[3060.94s -> 3062.22s]  That's actually really funny.
[3063.75s -> 3065.03s]  All right, this is where I wanted to go.
[3065.59s -> 3071.38s]  Pretty sick.
[3071.38s -> 3073.46s]  Cheese stacks?
[3073.46s -> 3074.10s]  Cheese tax.
[3074.74s -> 3087.27s]  Okay, got to be ready for anything.
[3087.99s -> 3094.98s]  Lump of flesh.
[3096.70s -> 3098.55s]  Wrist Lids Memento.
[3098.55s -> 3099.03s]  It's a key.
[3099.75s -> 3101.03s]  And a golden rune.
[3101.03s -> 3101.27s]  Okay.
[3101.91s -> 3103.34s]  I actually picked up a bunch of items.
[3103.34s -> 3104.06s]  I need to look what they do.
[3104.70s -> 3111.27s]  That's up there.
[3111.27s -> 3112.07s]  This is just the other room.
[3117.03s -> 3117.27s]  What?
[3117.27s -> 3117.59s]  Really?
[3118.31s -> 3121.54s]  Elevator.
[3122.66s -> 3130.71s]  I'm not going to get away with the cheese for long.
[3130.71s -> 3131.27s]  No, I know.
[3131.27s -> 3131.59s]  I know.
[3132.31s -> 3135.37s]  All right, so that...
[3136.25s -> 3136.65s]  This is...
[3138.09s -> 3138.89s]  Goes up here.
[3143.21s -> 3144.41s]  Okay, so now I'm...
[3145.13s -> 3146.49s]  This is like a weird skip.
[3146.73s -> 3147.13s]  What though?
[3151.69s -> 3152.57s]  This is the tower.
[3154.20s -> 3155.16s]  Tower's right here.
[3156.36s -> 3158.12s]  Where is this in regards to where I am right now?
[3159.32s -> 3161.56s]  Oh, nice.
[3162.28s -> 3168.81s]  Still need a little bit more.
[3168.81s -> 3169.45s]  I did get a rune.
[3170.09s -> 3174.97s]  This is a golden rune.
[3175.53s -> 3181.74s]  Still need more.
[3187.50s -> 3189.34s]  Let's just kill this guy and get his...
[3190.46s -> 3193.18s]  So I know I keep saying souls, but whatever.
[3208.38s -> 3210.54s]  All right, so that's actually really helpful.
[3211.34s -> 3212.46s]  Wait, I got a key item.
[3213.10s -> 3216.01s]  When I have a second to pause,
[3216.01s -> 3217.21s]  I'm going to take a look at it.
[3217.21s -> 3225.14s]  What is that for?
[3232.58s -> 3234.42s]  Roach wrapped in red velvet.
[3235.14s -> 3238.39s]  Cementa left by the chrysalid sacrifice for grafting.
[3238.39s -> 3239.83s]  A brooch wrapped in red velvet.
[3239.83s -> 3240.87s]  Traces of blood are visible.
[3241.51s -> 3244.07s]  faintly visible spirits try to convey something,
[3244.07s -> 3245.67s]  but their voices cannot be heard.
[3246.55s -> 3248.63s]  Key item.
[3252.15s -> 3254.15s]  Small withered bag knitted by hand.
[3254.87s -> 3255.51s]  Oh, okay.
[3256.39s -> 3257.98s]  Where does that go?
[3268.28s -> 3268.52s]  Okay.
[3269.16s -> 3273.85s]  Oh, progress I think is out this way, right?
[3276.36s -> 3276.60s]  No.
[3278.42s -> 3279.38s]  Progress is...
[3280.42s -> 3282.14s]  Where is progress?
[3286.02s -> 3286.74s]  Not over here.
[3287.46s -> 3289.98s]  I gotta go back up.
[3290.62s -> 3298.46s]  Yeah, I haven't gone up this way.
[3298.46s -> 3299.66s]  All right, progress is this way.
[3310.62s -> 3311.18s]  Did I go up this?
[3311.18s -> 3311.90s]  Did I go over here?
[3315.75s -> 3316.55s]  He's senile.
[3320.38s -> 3322.65s]  Yeah, it's this way, okay.
[3322.65s -> 3324.97s]  All right, there's that scary guy with the axe again.
[3325.85s -> 3326.66s]  I think I just...
[3327.46s -> 3339.66s]  Wait, is this openable with that thing?
[3340.81s -> 3349.80s]  Oh, this guy sucks.
[3349.80s -> 3353.18s]  I'm just running.
[3353.18s -> 3353.50s]  Fuck it.
[3354.06s -> 3357.78s]  Actually, I could probably get by him.
[3357.78s -> 3358.74s]  I don't want to fight this guy again.
[3358.74s -> 3359.22s]  He's annoying.
[3361.40s -> 3362.28s]  He BMs.
[3362.28s -> 3363.08s]  He's a BMer.
[3363.08s -> 3363.56s]  I don't like him.
[3365.54s -> 3366.10s]  All right, then...
[3367.56s -> 3368.68s]  Whoa, I can jump over this.
[3371.46s -> 3371.94s]  Okay.
[3371.94s -> 3385.94s]  You should play Elden Ring.
[3385.94s -> 3386.50s]  Stop.
[3386.50s -> 3387.06s]  What are you doing?
[3391.22s -> 3392.50s]  Don't blow the horn.
[3392.50s -> 3401.19s]  Okay.
[3401.19s -> 3403.19s]  Sound of progress, my friend.
[3403.19s -> 3410.74s]  Okay.
[3410.74s -> 3413.61s]  Hey, hey, remember me?
[3415.21s -> 3416.87s]  Yeah, can he hit you through a wall?
[3418.79s -> 3420.31s]  Or should I hope not?
[3427.90s -> 3430.55s]  Oh, but there's something down there.
[3431.19s -> 3436.62s]  There's a lot of stuff down here.
[3439.43s -> 3441.51s]  This is the front door to the castle,
[3441.51s -> 3442.87s]  but I was never able to get up there.
[3443.51s -> 3447.54s]  Yeah, I see the ladder here, but...
[3447.54s -> 3448.98s]  I mean, look, there's items.
[3448.98s -> 3450.02s]  There's stuff on the ground.
[3451.51s -> 3452.07s]  One, two...
[3452.87s -> 3453.75s]  Maybe I can go through...
[3454.55s -> 3455.37s]  Let me see if there's...
[3455.37s -> 3456.73s]  Okay, there's a ladder there.
[3456.73s -> 3457.77s]  Ah, just stuff I missed.
[3458.33s -> 3459.34s]  Ah, fuck it.
[3459.34s -> 3459.66s]  Whatever.
[3461.27s -> 3462.31s]  Guy, I see the ladder.
[3462.31s -> 3463.03s]  I see the ladder.
[3463.03s -> 3463.51s]  Don't worry.
[3464.15s -> 3466.62s]  Tree's going to be a boss.
[3467.26s -> 3470.33s]  Just calling it now.
[3470.89s -> 3476.04s]  Okay.
[3476.04s -> 3481.80s]  A weird spot.
[3481.80s -> 3482.60s]  Let me see what's over here.
[3483.24s -> 3490.17s]  A lot of nothing.
[3490.81s -> 3496.09s]  I can go that way.
[3500.63s -> 3502.15s]  Let me drop down there.
[3502.95s -> 3504.73s]  See what the heck's going on over there.
[3505.37s -> 3510.04s]  Yeah, let me see what the heck's going on here.
[3520.31s -> 3520.55s]  So...
[3522.07s -> 3524.07s]  Ah, this is the door.
[3525.50s -> 3525.74s]  Wait.
[3539.19s -> 3540.23s]  What a terrible guard.
[3542.42s -> 3544.02s]  Are you looking into the wall?
[3544.02s -> 3545.94s]  Like, if you're aiming this way?
[3546.50s -> 3547.22s]  What are you doing?
[3547.22s -> 3548.10s]  He was AFK.
[3552.33s -> 3553.29s]  Pickled turtleneck?
[3555.98s -> 3557.66s]  Why do I feel like that's like a TikTok
[3557.66s -> 3558.86s]  or like an Instagram trend?
[3560.06s -> 3561.10s]  Pickling your clothing.
[3563.24s -> 3563.88s]  Yeah, we see.
[3563.88s -> 3565.24s]  I pickled it for about six months
[3565.24s -> 3567.56s]  and it came out and it actually looks a lot better.
[3567.56s -> 3568.92s]  I like the design that came out with it.
[3571.29s -> 3571.53s]  Nice.
[3583.18s -> 3584.06s]  Boomer moment.
[3584.06s -> 3585.18s]  Why, because I said TikTok.
[3587.38s -> 3588.58s]  So I said TikTok.
[3590.78s -> 3592.14s]  I like that I said TikTok.
[3597.93s -> 3599.13s]  You should, you should, you should.
[3599.13s -> 3600.25s]  Yeah, you should do the orangutan.
[3603.00s -> 3604.76s]  Okay, so that got me the key,
[3604.76s -> 3606.60s]  which now I just got to run around,
[3606.60s -> 3608.60s]  which there's the door that led to here.
[3609.72s -> 3611.80s]  That guy, that guy was just resting.
[3611.80s -> 3612.04s]  Yep.
[3612.84s -> 3614.63s]  I think I have to go back up though.
[3615.19s -> 3616.81s]  This is no way to go the other way
[3616.81s -> 3617.77s]  unless I can go this way.
[3618.25s -> 3623.16s]  Which I don't think I can.
[3623.16s -> 3629.53s]  Um, anything on the chandeliers?
[3629.53s -> 3630.01s]  No.
[3630.01s -> 3630.81s]  No, we just got to go back.
[3631.61s -> 3635.46s]  Back up, dude.
[3635.46s -> 3636.82s]  Dude, just go full magic build.
[3638.55s -> 3640.07s]  No, I don't, I'm not going to go full magic.
[3643.80s -> 3645.24s]  Okay, well, I just need to go.
[3645.24s -> 3645.96s]  Where am I going here?
[3645.96s -> 3647.08s]  Over here, right?
[3647.08s -> 3649.50s]  Whatever, I'm just going this way.
[3649.50s -> 3656.06s]  Where's the, where the hell am I?
[3656.06s -> 3661.03s]  I need to get back up to where I was.
[3661.75s -> 3663.19s]  Wait, what?
[3666.20s -> 3667.48s]  Getting confused.
[3667.48s -> 3670.89s]  Uh, I should actually start putting markers
[3672.60s -> 3674.44s]  down or just kind of traveling around
[3674.44s -> 3675.32s]  and walking around because
[3676.58s -> 3677.78s]  kind of go around in circles sometimes
[3677.78s -> 3678.90s]  and you're just like, wait, where the fuck am I?
[3690.46s -> 3691.50s]  Okay, yeah.
[3691.50s -> 3692.54s]  And then over this way.
[3692.54s -> 3692.78s]  Yep.
[3693.50s -> 3700.44s]  What about your notes?
[3701.16s -> 3703.56s]  Um, I think notes are for like important things
[3703.56s -> 3704.60s]  that I have to remember.
[3705.32s -> 3706.68s]  Not necessarily about direction.
[3710.20s -> 3711.32s]  So this is going up here.
[3711.32s -> 3713.48s]  So now just climb back up.
[3716.60s -> 3717.24s]  Climb up here.
[3717.80s -> 3719.00s]  I almost have enough to do the...
[3720.20s -> 3722.36s]  I feel like I'm going to find another fire though.
[3722.36s -> 3725.00s]  Like almost immediately, like very soon here.
[3725.64s -> 3727.91s]  That's what's getting me down there.
[3727.91s -> 3729.99s]  All right, I am convinced
[3729.99s -> 3731.91s]  that there is going to be a fire here soon.
[3734.87s -> 3736.47s]  So I'm just going to keep going.
[3737.19s -> 3741.64s]  I just, just jump down here.
[3741.64s -> 3746.66s]  I just go down here.
[3746.66s -> 3747.70s]  I think I'm just going to go down here.
[3748.34s -> 3752.14s]  Use the key.
[3752.14s -> 3752.86s]  I think I need to.
[3753.58s -> 3754.70s]  I think I'm just going down here.
[3757.70s -> 3759.06s]  Like what, like whatever, right?
[3759.06s -> 3761.70s]  Like should I, I can go from here to there?
[3761.70s -> 3763.62s]  No, I just jump from here to there.
[3764.42s -> 3767.77s]  I feel like I'm going to die.
[3768.41s -> 3775.22s]  Don't break your hip.
[3775.22s -> 3775.78s]  Don't do it.
[3775.78s -> 3776.98s]  It could be fall damage.
[3776.98s -> 3778.02s]  Use the ladder instead.
[3779.85s -> 3782.98s]  Um, what's over here?
[3783.62s -> 3787.80s]  Can I not go over there?
[3792.12s -> 3793.24s]  It looks like I can jump over there
[3793.24s -> 3793.80s]  and go that way.
[3794.52s -> 3797.98s]  Use the ladder.
[3798.62s -> 3799.82s]  I'll go back down.
[3799.82s -> 3800.94s]  Maybe that's actually death.
[3801.66s -> 3809.00s]  But from here, I'm trying to think of where that guy can go.
[3810.10s -> 3812.02s]  I could go this way, jump down here,
[3812.02s -> 3812.82s]  and then go over there.
[3813.70s -> 3814.26s]  I do that?
[3814.98s -> 3816.50s]  I'm just going to do it.
[3817.38s -> 3822.06s]  I think, I think I'm doing it.
[3822.06s -> 3822.94s]  I'm just going to go that way.
[3829.74s -> 3836.87s]  Okay. Um, I'm here.
[3836.87s -> 3838.39s]  I might as well get the items.
[3838.39s -> 3840.39s]  There are a couple.
[3848.70s -> 3849.42s]  Ooh, that's good.
[3855.48s -> 3856.36s]  All right, I'm going to go that way
[3856.36s -> 3857.08s]  and jump over now.
[3857.72s -> 3861.19s]  Did you get the cat item?
[3861.19s -> 3862.63s]  I don't, I don't think so.
[3873.08s -> 3873.96s]  Arrows.
[3873.96s -> 3874.52s]  All right.
[3874.52s -> 3875.56s]  This is where it gets weird.
[3884.17s -> 3886.41s]  I think that's the, that's where I got to go.
[3887.21s -> 3888.25s]  Or down there.
[3888.97s -> 3894.58s]  Please tell me there's a fire here.
[3894.58s -> 3897.50s]  I feel like I've gone a pretty long ways without one.
[3897.50s -> 3900.60s]  Wait, shit.
[3900.60s -> 3901.40s]  I can go down here.
[3902.04s -> 3902.60s]  I can also.
[3906.87s -> 3909.11s]  Now that's just kind of where I was before the main gate, right?
[3919.34s -> 3920.62s]  Festering bloody finger.
[3921.34s -> 3925.08s]  Okay, I can't.
[3925.08s -> 3926.44s]  This is going to be very tricky.
[3933.00s -> 3934.52s]  I have to just be a gamer here.
[3935.16s -> 3938.47s]  If I can just pull one, that would be great
[3939.11s -> 3941.82s]  because I don't want to fight them both at the same time.
[3941.82s -> 3943.50s]  I hope they don't aggro at the same time.
[3943.50s -> 3944.54s]  So we're just going to go for it.
[3945.10s -> 3965.11s]  The slow fucking attacks kill me every time.
[3965.11s -> 3966.23s]  They're so slow.
[3968.26s -> 3971.62s]  I just, they're like, oh, two seconds.
[3971.62s -> 3974.42s]  I just think it's going to happen way sooner than it does.
[3977.99s -> 3979.35s]  Everybody's so slow in this game.
[3979.35s -> 3980.79s]  Everybody takes forever to swing.
[3987.90s -> 3988.46s]  Fuck.
[3988.46s -> 3992.78s]  At least I have the skill.
[3992.78s -> 3999.18s]  That's copium.
[3999.82s -> 4000.86s]  Yeah, it is copium.
[4000.86s -> 4003.18s]  And I'm going to suck it and smell it.
[4003.18s -> 4004.70s]  Whatever that, you know what I mean?
[4014.38s -> 4017.02s]  Copium, you like, you like, you suck it.
[4017.02s -> 4018.30s]  You like an hit, right?
[4024.02s -> 4026.98s]  Again, like, like I fought that last boss in Elden Ring.
[4027.62s -> 4030.98s]  Wait a full, another full second before you dodge
[4030.98s -> 4032.98s]  with every single enemy in the entire game.
[4035.80s -> 4038.36s]  Everybody's weapons are apparently so heavy in this game
[4038.36s -> 4041.08s]  that it gives them five full seconds to fucking swing them.
[4042.87s -> 4043.91s]  Uly noted.
[4043.91s -> 4055.58s]  Back over here, right?
[4055.58s -> 4056.30s]  Yeah.
[4056.30s -> 4060.89s]  You lost a bunch of souls.
[4060.89s -> 4061.77s]  I didn't lose them yet.
[4062.81s -> 4063.78s]  Go get them.
[4063.78s -> 4069.64s]  So I, well, just stay down there.
[4069.64s -> 4069.96s]  I don't care.
[4080.89s -> 4082.57s]  Deep slurping copium?
[4083.21s -> 4086.25s]  What does that mean?
[4092.28s -> 4093.08s]  Turn it on high.
[4093.80s -> 4097.11s]  Sir, I don't think you should turn it on high.
[4097.11s -> 4099.51s]  Turn it, turn it on as high as it goes.
[4101.00s -> 4101.56s]  I don't know.
[4101.56s -> 4102.84s]  I think that's kind of dangerous.
[4102.84s -> 4104.92s]  I said to do something that means you do it.
[4104.92s -> 4105.40s]  I'm king.
[4105.40s -> 4105.80s]  King.
[4115.40s -> 4115.88s]  Too much.
[4116.60s -> 4126.50s]  Raid song.
[4126.50s -> 4127.62s]  Oh, here we go.
[4127.62s -> 4128.26s]  We got a raid.
[4129.80s -> 4130.68s]  Too much copium.
[4131.56s -> 4136.82s]  I feel the need to defend every single Marvel movie
[4136.82s -> 4140.33s]  and Marvel TV show ever made.
[4141.13s -> 4142.89s]  Even dating back to the fucking 90s.
[4143.61s -> 4146.89s]  Thanks, RT.
[4146.89s -> 4149.13s]  Appreciate the raid.
[4151.30s -> 4152.26s]  We're doing Elden Ring.
[4159.30s -> 4160.26s]  Are you playing Elden Ring too?
[4160.74s -> 4168.07s]  Oh man, people just came in inhaling copium.
[4174.68s -> 4175.64s]  You don't understand.
[4175.64s -> 4178.20s]  I think X-Men Wolverine Origins
[4178.92s -> 4180.36s]  actually was a pretty good movie.
[4181.00s -> 4182.44s]  It was actually very well made
[4182.44s -> 4184.60s]  and the cinematography was actually pretty good.
[4186.74s -> 4188.58s]  King German, what the fuck are you talking about?
[4190.62s -> 4192.70s]  It's like 1400.
[4192.70s -> 4193.98s]  Why are you saying these things?
[4198.20s -> 4200.60s]  2006 was four years ago.
[4203.11s -> 4204.47s]  Well, thanks for the raid, dude.
[4204.47s -> 4205.27s]  Welcome.
[4205.27s -> 4206.44s]  Hope you're doing good.
[4207.08s -> 4210.38s]  I currently just was very upset at this game
[4210.38s -> 4212.70s]  because I found it to be not cool and not fun
[4213.26s -> 4215.50s]  and very not hog champ.
[4216.22s -> 4217.67s]  All right, I gotta pay attention.
[4217.67s -> 4218.39s]  I gotta figure out where I'm going.
[4218.39s -> 4220.90s]  Where am I going?
[4220.90s -> 4227.22s]  The idea is back to...
[4227.22s -> 4228.98s]  This is why I need the fucking marker.
[4228.98s -> 4234.36s]  It was down the ladder and then where?
[4234.36s -> 4235.56s]  It was like right here somewhere, right?
[4235.56s -> 4236.68s]  I thought I dropped down, right?
[4237.24s -> 4240.23s]  I went right here.
[4242.89s -> 4243.93s]  Maybe I can hit something
[4243.93s -> 4245.05s]  so I don't get to take damage,
[4245.05s -> 4245.93s]  but I don't think I can.
[4246.49s -> 4247.29s]  Did that work?
[4247.29s -> 4248.74s]  No.
[4248.74s -> 4250.26s]  All right, no more copium.
[4250.26s -> 4252.58s]  No more bullshit.
[4252.58s -> 4253.78s]  Just go get this guy.
[4256.95s -> 4258.47s]  The slow swings.
[4258.47s -> 4259.19s]  Just get ready.
[4260.07s -> 4261.51s]  I know it's going to make me very mad
[4261.51s -> 4262.87s]  and you're all going to laugh.
[4262.87s -> 4265.51s]  Everyone's going to laugh at me when I lose again.
[4267.75s -> 4298.20s]  Oh, that's bad.
[4298.84s -> 4299.64s]  That's fucking bad.
[4300.84s -> 4307.21s]  Wait, it's climbing the ladder.
[4310.18s -> 4311.06s]  Guys, what?
[4311.62s -> 4312.10s]  Come on.
[4313.48s -> 4314.84s]  Get away from me.
[4314.84s -> 4316.12s]  You don't climb ladders.
[4325.88s -> 4326.60s]  Shit.
[4326.60s -> 4351.48s]  I was fully prepared to do that again.
[4351.48s -> 4356.42s]  Where is he?
[4358.81s -> 4360.97s]  Oh, it's a fucking thing, the drape.
[4361.53s -> 4363.85s]  I thought like a tentacle came down and grabbed me.
[4367.66s -> 4368.78s]  Dude, why?
[4368.78s -> 4370.86s]  Now I'm like I'm all cracked out now.
[4371.66s -> 4372.62s]  Holy shit.
[4374.89s -> 4377.53s]  I am cracked up right now after that.
[4377.53s -> 4378.41s]  Are you kidding me?
[4380.36s -> 4381.48s]  That's so violent.
[4381.48s -> 4383.88s]  That moved around so weirdly and violently.
[4384.52s -> 4390.38s]  I think I can get him before he comes over here.
[4391.18s -> 4391.58s]  All right.
[4404.86s -> 4408.47s]  I'm definitely losing souls because I had like 4,000.
[4413.94s -> 4414.50s]  Copium.
[4419.16s -> 4420.68s]  He's coping in advance.
[4420.68s -> 4422.84s]  Yeah, I was because if I died,
[4422.84s -> 4425.48s]  you were about to hear a lot of bullshit.
[4425.48s -> 4427.32s]  Okay, I was going to talk a bunch of shit.
[4429.82s -> 4433.90s]  You wouldn't be able to escape it unless you of course hit the X and left
[4433.90s -> 4435.10s]  because you didn't want to listen to it.
[4435.90s -> 4440.28s]  All right, but I'm still not out of this yet.
[4440.28s -> 4445.98s]  I'm kind of fucked right now because unless I...
[4446.62s -> 4447.74s]  Okay, that guy's going to shoot me.
[4451.19s -> 4453.11s]  Oh, no, he's going to shoot me with that.
[4453.11s -> 4453.75s]  It's going to hit me.
[4458.25s -> 4458.81s]  No, don't get up.
[4458.81s -> 4459.13s]  Don't get up.
[4459.13s -> 4471.42s]  Don't get up.
[4471.42s -> 4472.78s]  This fucking horse shit.
[4473.42s -> 4476.44s]  There's always a guy sitting down somewhere
[4477.45s -> 4480.33s]  who slowly gets up after you attack the one guy that you see.
[4480.89s -> 4482.95s]  Oh, I'm insane.
[4482.95s -> 4483.67s]  I got to run by it.
[4484.31s -> 4489.74s]  I'm just running by all these fucking turds.
[4493.70s -> 4495.22s]  Here comes the cheese tax.
[4495.22s -> 4497.06s]  There is no cheese tax, but it's called
[4497.06s -> 4501.86s]  I'm running by everybody and hopefully I don't die in the process and lose four thousands.
[4502.82s -> 4504.22s]  Whatever they are.
[4504.22s -> 4509.42s]  If you were in a souls game, what kind of creature would you be?
[4510.14s -> 4511.74s]  Definitely one of the ones that goes like this.
[4513.34s -> 4517.77s]  You know what I mean?
[4522.70s -> 4523.50s]  I didn't want to do it.
[4523.50s -> 4527.10s]  I really didn't want to do it because I didn't want to like hurt everybody's ears.
[4527.66s -> 4536.18s]  And my move set would definitely be the one of the ones that goes like making that sound
[4536.18s -> 4541.78s]  and then going and then falling down.
[4542.34s -> 4554.73s]  And then you just you kill me in three hits back up.
[4555.45s -> 4559.82s]  I'm going to just try to get over there and run and just pick up my souls at least.
[4560.62s -> 4562.86s]  And this if I die here.
[4562.86s -> 4565.66s]  Oh, I'm going to be upset, but let me just be not stupid about this.
[4566.30s -> 4569.03s]  Selectively kill people that need to just knock him down.
[4569.03s -> 4569.59s]  Okay, just go.
[4570.55s -> 4572.79s]  Where is he at?
[4575.88s -> 4576.44s]  Pretty bad.
[4583.03s -> 4584.31s]  Okay, we're safe.
[4584.31s -> 4591.90s]  It looks like Burger King's.
[4593.18s -> 4594.22s]  It looks like Burger King.
[4595.48s -> 4596.12s]  Sneak King.
[4596.84s -> 4599.24s]  You mean I look like the Burger King from Burger King.
[4599.80s -> 4602.68s]  They didn't make him up for Sneak King, although that would be really funny if they did.
[4615.26s -> 4616.30s]  Already out of potions.
[4617.18s -> 4619.74s]  Okay, so I got to just get over there.
[4619.74s -> 4624.20s]  Ignore everybody and just get the souls and just run.
[4625.61s -> 4626.09s]  It's okay.
[4626.09s -> 4627.69s]  That's what you can do that in these games.
[4627.69s -> 4628.73s]  It's a decent strategy.
[4628.73s -> 4629.29s]  It really is.
[4630.60s -> 4631.96s]  So they're around the corner.
[4631.96s -> 4632.84s]  I see him right there.
[4646.07s -> 4646.63s]  See ya.
[4648.84s -> 4649.32s]  See ya.
[4649.96s -> 4652.57s]  Where do I go from here?
[4652.57s -> 4653.29s]  There's a lot of.
[4654.25s -> 4655.13s]  Oh, a lot of.
[4656.14s -> 4657.18s]  Oh, thank God.
[4658.46s -> 4659.74s]  He hit me with that.
[4659.74s -> 4660.70s]  The hitbox.
[4660.70s -> 4664.62s]  Somebody fucking 10 miles down the road swung an axe and I got hit by it.
[4665.18s -> 4665.90s]  Oh, yeah.
[4665.90s -> 4666.70s]  They're climbing.
[4666.70s -> 4667.34s]  They're climbing.
[4667.34s -> 4667.90s]  They're climbing.
[4667.90s -> 4668.38s]  They're climbing.
[4668.38s -> 4668.94s]  They're climbing.
[4668.94s -> 4670.22s]  They're climbing up right now.
[4670.22s -> 4671.26s]  They're right behind me.
[4671.26s -> 4672.14s]  They're right behind me.
[4672.14s -> 4673.26s]  They're right behind me, I think.
[4673.26s -> 4674.22s]  They're right behind me.
[4674.94s -> 4676.60s]  I got a cookbook.
[4679.78s -> 4680.66s]  I escaped.
[4680.66s -> 4681.14s]  Where am I?
[4681.70s -> 4685.61s]  Where am I?
[4685.61s -> 4690.33s]  Almost fell down that hole.
[4690.33s -> 4691.05s]  That would have been horrible.
[4693.56s -> 4694.28s]  Do I need to go there?
[4696.38s -> 4698.46s]  Yeah, they're taking souls away.
[4702.74s -> 4703.46s]  That's new.
[4703.46s -> 4705.06s]  That's not in any of the other games.
[4705.06s -> 4706.66s]  They're literally it's a tax.
[4706.66s -> 4707.62s]  It's a death tax.
[4720.09s -> 4721.37s]  It's like 30 percent.
[4721.37s -> 4722.17s]  Yeah, that's new.
[4723.59s -> 4723.99s]  All right.
[4724.63s -> 4726.07s]  Did I miss anything over here?
[4726.07s -> 4728.79s]  I'm afraid to try to make this jump, actually, if I'm honest.
[4729.35s -> 4730.87s]  Otherwise, I'm fucking dead meat.
[4731.59s -> 4734.95s]  So do I drop down here and just spam at this guy?
[4741.03s -> 4741.83s]  Yeah, right.
[4742.95s -> 4743.83s]  Yeah, right.
[4744.71s -> 4746.15s]  Un-fucking-believable, dude.
[4746.15s -> 4747.83s]  That was almost a disaster.
[4749.16s -> 4750.12s]  You got to be kidding me.
[4752.62s -> 4753.66s]  It's going to hit me through the floor.
[4754.30s -> 4775.77s]  Please don't have anybody in this room.
[4775.77s -> 4779.74s]  Wooden great shield.
[4779.74s -> 4790.25s]  I could go that on my end.
[4790.25s -> 4791.05s]  That's a big person.
[4791.85s -> 4792.73s]  I could go that way.
[4793.61s -> 4794.89s]  I could try to go that way.
[4794.89s -> 4795.85s]  Let me see what's over here.
[4796.49s -> 4798.33s]  I need a better weapon.
[4798.33s -> 4799.69s]  I need to upgrade a weapon.
[4800.49s -> 4801.85s]  I actually did pick up a weapon.
[4801.85s -> 4803.21s]  I forget what it was, but hold on.
[4803.21s -> 4803.69s]  Let me see.
[4804.49s -> 4806.52s]  Or anything here that I need to look at.
[4807.80s -> 4808.04s]  All right.
[4808.04s -> 4808.76s]  I'm going over there.
[4809.91s -> 4815.98s]  There's also that wolf with the sword enemy thing that I could probably go kill.
[4816.54s -> 4818.36s]  Did they get a new axe?
[4818.36s -> 4818.60s]  Yeah.
[4819.40s -> 4837.80s]  Um, I don't know.
[4838.36s -> 4840.04s]  I'm not sure where to go.
[4840.68s -> 4845.00s]  Need to call the boys?
[4845.72s -> 4849.59s]  That's actually not a bad idea.
[4850.23s -> 4853.90s]  If I don't need to aggro this...
[4853.90s -> 4855.74s]  There's a dog right there.
[4855.74s -> 4856.94s]  Oh my god.
[4863.64s -> 4864.70s]  All right.
[4864.70s -> 4867.34s]  In that door or up in that door?
[4868.22s -> 4870.89s]  I don't know.
[4870.89s -> 4873.53s]  I think before I do this, I think I have to consult with the boys.
[4876.17s -> 4876.57s]  All right.
[4877.29s -> 4877.85s]  Here's the plan.
[4878.49s -> 4880.65s]  We have an opportunity to go up
[4881.13s -> 4881.77s]  or we have to...
[4882.41s -> 4883.77s]  I hear somebody moving.
[4883.77s -> 4884.01s]  Okay.
[4884.01s -> 4884.49s]  No, I don't.
[4885.56s -> 4886.68s]  We have an opportunity, boys.
[4887.40s -> 4888.23s]  Let's go.
[4888.87s -> 4893.22s]  What's that?
[4893.22s -> 4893.62s]  I don't know.
[4897.35s -> 4898.31s]  Boys, no.
[4898.31s -> 4898.55s]  No.
[4899.11s -> 4900.23s]  Don't attack people.
[4900.79s -> 4904.74s]  Um, bonfire.
[4904.74s -> 4905.70s]  Bonfire.
[4906.58s -> 4907.54s]  Nice job, boys.
[4908.10s -> 4909.02s]  We did it.
[4909.66s -> 4911.54s]  We attacked like a boss.
[4912.42s -> 4913.06s]  All right.
[4913.06s -> 4913.54s]  Let's go.
[4914.55s -> 4915.51s]  Hell yeah.
[4915.51s -> 4922.50s]  The boys are the fucking worst.
[4922.50s -> 4930.31s]  They're so awful.
[4930.31s -> 4930.79s]  Okay.
[4930.79s -> 4931.67s]  So what are we doing here?
[4931.67s -> 4933.75s]  Probably another point into...
[4934.47s -> 4941.29s]  Do I want more endurance?
[4942.33s -> 4942.89s]  I think so.
[4943.45s -> 4944.73s]  Either endurance or intelligence.
[4944.73s -> 4945.85s]  No, get intelligence to 18.
[4952.92s -> 4955.62s]  So, very important.
[4956.18s -> 4957.30s]  Let's go kill this fucking guy.
[4959.27s -> 4959.67s]  Why not?
[4972.82s -> 4974.50s]  I'm trying to go up the goddamn stairs.
[4975.30s -> 4979.48s]  You just hit your own dog.
[4986.92s -> 5011.64s]  I didn't get the backstab.
[5011.64s -> 5011.88s]  Shit.
[5012.44s -> 5055.61s]  Fuck you.
[5055.61s -> 5056.81s]  Oh, there's an animal up here.
[5057.61s -> 5059.13s]  He's trying to kick me down the stairs.
[5064.09s -> 5065.69s]  Oh, there's no juice in this thing.
[5066.33s -> 5081.80s]  What are you worrying about in your head?
[5081.80s -> 5082.84s]  Is that a pumpkin?
[5082.84s -> 5083.08s]  All right.
[5083.08s -> 5088.14s]  Well, that guy's gone.
[5090.15s -> 5090.55s]  He was...
[5090.55s -> 5091.83s]  There's something where he was standing.
[5091.83s -> 5092.31s]  What is this?
[5092.87s -> 5096.04s]  What is that?
[5096.04s -> 5097.50s]  Can I break this or something?
[5098.06s -> 5100.12s]  It's like a weird thing to have here.
[5100.12s -> 5100.52s]  What is this?
[5101.24s -> 5113.85s]  Start using one-liners when you get kills.
[5113.85s -> 5114.41s]  Nope.
[5114.41s -> 5115.61s]  I'm not going to do that because...
[5118.94s -> 5119.90s]  Um, what is this?
[5124.84s -> 5125.88s]  Prophecy painting.
[5127.85s -> 5128.81s]  Prophecy painting.
[5143.19s -> 5144.55s]  Prophecy painting.
[5145.59s -> 5147.51s]  Reminisce of the painting prophecy.
[5147.51s -> 5148.87s]  Examine it using square.
[5151.42s -> 5152.46s]  I'm afraid to touch this.
[5153.34s -> 5161.45s]  Square X whatever.
[5162.41s -> 5163.77s]  I actually don't think I want to do that.
[5163.77s -> 5164.97s]  I'm kind of scared to press that button.
[5165.77s -> 5168.31s]  What if it like sucks me into a new world or something?
[5177.85s -> 5179.29s]  We're watching you in a bar, German.
[5179.29s -> 5180.09s]  Do something wacky.
[5181.21s -> 5181.45s]  Hey.
[5184.41s -> 5187.69s]  Hey, this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.
[5188.98s -> 5189.22s]  Hey.
[5190.09s -> 5190.41s]  Three.
[5190.97s -> 5191.21s]  Two.
[5191.77s -> 5192.17s]  One.
[5192.17s -> 5192.65s]  Let's go.
[5196.68s -> 5197.24s]  Mmm.
[5197.24s -> 5197.88s]  Green tea.
[5198.76s -> 5202.31s]  Hey, what are you drinking?
[5202.31s -> 5205.19s]  Hey, dude, what are you drinking?
[5205.19s -> 5207.51s]  Oh, it's a vodka pineapple with a little bit of cranberry.
[5207.51s -> 5210.15s]  What are you drinking?
[5210.15s -> 5210.87s]  Hey.
[5210.87s -> 5212.60s]  Hey, what are you drinking?
[5213.16s -> 5214.57s]  What do you got?
[5214.57s -> 5216.71s]  What are you drinking?
[5216.71s -> 5217.11s]  A beer?
[5217.11s -> 5217.51s]  Oh, cool.
[5217.51s -> 5218.63s]  What kind of beer?
[5218.63s -> 5227.18s]  Oh, what are you drinking?
[5228.38s -> 5230.70s]  Welcome to every conversation you have in a fucking bar.
[5231.34s -> 5234.82s]  Oh, can I try that?
[5234.82s -> 5235.62s]  Yeah, let me try.
[5237.98s -> 5239.42s]  Oh, that's like spicy.
[5239.42s -> 5239.82s]  What do you got?
[5239.82s -> 5240.30s]  What's that one?
[5241.42s -> 5243.74s]  Oh, that's called the Dr. Manhattan.
[5243.74s -> 5244.46s]  Let me try that.
[5244.46s -> 5245.50s]  It's blue and it smells.
[5247.99s -> 5248.31s]  I don't know.
[5248.31s -> 5248.79s]  That's not for me.
[5248.79s -> 5249.59s]  I don't like gin.
[5249.59s -> 5250.07s]  What do you got?
[5250.07s -> 5250.39s]  Let me see.
[5251.11s -> 5255.13s]  I don't like beer, dude.
[5255.13s -> 5255.93s]  I'm not a beer guy.
[5257.80s -> 5258.60s]  Anyone want to try mine?
[5259.64s -> 5260.68s]  It's fucking sludge.
[5260.68s -> 5262.36s]  I got it from the fucking toilet.
[5262.36s -> 5262.76s]  Try it.
[5263.56s -> 5280.41s]  Minus two, play the game.
[5286.02s -> 5287.70s]  They said I was on TV in their bar.
[5287.70s -> 5289.86s]  What, you want me to not like say hello?
[5289.86s -> 5294.44s]  There's a door back here.
[5303.56s -> 5305.32s]  This is a shortcut, maybe.
[5305.32s -> 5314.33s]  This looks like it's probably a shortcut to find out.
[5314.33s -> 5321.05s]  How much to have you sing at my wedding?
[5323.78s -> 5324.74s]  Three or four million dollars.
[5333.72s -> 5335.24s]  So, okay.
[5335.24s -> 5336.36s]  I'm not going down there yet.
[5341.58s -> 5343.50s]  Is this the front door?
[5343.50s -> 5344.06s]  It's not.
[5344.78s -> 5350.44s]  But this, I have not been over here.
[5350.44s -> 5351.88s]  That's not the front gate.
[5351.88s -> 5353.00s]  The front gate's down here.
[5358.52s -> 5360.92s]  So, I should probably take a look over here for a minute.
[5360.92s -> 5367.38s]  Did I even rest at that stupid bonfire?
[5367.94s -> 5376.97s]  I'm also going to do some allocation here.
[5376.97s -> 5379.37s]  I want to, I need more health.
[5379.37s -> 5382.50s]  How do I like Breath of the Wild so far?
[5382.50s -> 5383.78s]  I never played Breath of the Wild.
[5384.42s -> 5395.40s]  I haven't played it.
[5397.34s -> 5398.14s]  Sorry.
[5398.14s -> 5400.34s]  The bar is real.
[5404.76s -> 5405.64s]  Bar video.
[5406.28s -> 5418.86s]  What am I doing up here?
[5419.66s -> 5420.70s]  What am I doing up here?
[5423.96s -> 5425.32s]  They can't even hear me.
[5426.28s -> 5427.32s]  Should I try to communicate?
[5433.21s -> 5438.81s]  Like, hey, hey, wait, wait, look, look.
[5439.70s -> 5440.58s]  Look over here.
[5441.46s -> 5444.66s]  Hey, everybody, everybody, look over here.
[5446.74s -> 5451.18s]  Hey, you, wait, look.
[5451.18s -> 5454.30s]  Hey, everybody, hey.
[5454.94s -> 5459.18s]  One, two, three.
[5463.29s -> 5463.79s]  Yeah.
[5470.63s -> 5475.11s]  I'm probably, I probably just look like a fucking psycho.
[5475.11s -> 5477.27s]  Nobody's probably watching this TV.
[5478.07s -> 5479.67s]  Nobody's watching this TV.
[5479.67s -> 5480.71s]  I don't think anyone is.
[5482.73s -> 5484.49s]  It's going to be so weird looking over there
[5484.49s -> 5488.47s]  and being like, what's going on on the TV over there?
[5489.11s -> 5491.03s]  In a lot of bars, TVs are just on.
[5491.03s -> 5491.91s]  Like, I'll be honest.
[5492.71s -> 5494.79s]  They're kind of like, they'll be like a basketball game
[5494.79s -> 5497.99s]  or like a baseball game or like some talk show.
[5497.99s -> 5499.75s]  Nobody's really paying attention.
[5501.46s -> 5502.90s]  Use the notepad to say hi.
[5510.18s -> 5520.20s]  Okay, I'm trying to communicate.
[5520.92s -> 5590.63s]  Okay, I'm going to play the game now.
[5590.63s -> 5593.11s]  Somebody was just really mad that I wasn't playing the game.
[5593.67s -> 5600.50s]  The funniest part is that nobody is probably looking.
[5600.50s -> 5602.82s]  I just look like a fucking weirdo.
[5604.47s -> 5607.99s]  Wait, hold on.
[5607.99s -> 5609.11s]  Is there another one?
[5609.11s -> 5614.57s]  Is it, wait, you took another video?
[5614.57s -> 5617.70s]  We have an update.
[5617.70s -> 5626.04s]  Play the fucking game.
[5626.04s -> 5627.64s]  Hold on, I'm communicating.
[5627.64s -> 5629.88s]  I'm going to be streaming for like 10 hours today.
[5629.88s -> 5630.52s]  Don't worry.
[5634.30s -> 5635.34s]  Oh, what's your, hold on.
[5635.34s -> 5636.90s]  Here it is.
[5636.90s -> 5637.40s]  Update.
[5645.42s -> 5647.02s]  People aren't even paying.
[5647.02s -> 5649.50s]  I look like such a fucking weirdo.
[5649.50s -> 5651.18s]  Oh my God.
[5651.18s -> 5652.30s]  Okay, hold on a second.
[5652.30s -> 5653.50s]  This looks so stupid.
[5659.18s -> 5661.18s]  Okay, let's watch the, oh, you got to, hold on.
[5668.92s -> 5669.64s]  So stupid.
[5670.28s -> 5686.63s]  Play the game.
[5686.63s -> 5687.43s]  Hold on a second.
[5693.77s -> 5696.46s]  Oh my God, hold on.
[5696.46s -> 5697.42s]  I want to be able to show it.
[5699.64s -> 5700.84s]  That's so ridiculous.
[5701.90s -> 5703.90s]  Pretend you're stuck in the TV.
[5714.86s -> 5716.54s]  No, guys, you're killing me.
[5718.14s -> 5718.86s]  You're killing me.
[5721.10s -> 5723.42s]  I need to be able to like see, where is this?
[5723.42s -> 5724.38s]  Why did it just disappear?
[5727.80s -> 5729.22s]  I'm like.
[5731.14s -> 5739.96s]  Where is it?
[5739.96s -> 5741.08s]  Where is it?
[5741.64s -> 5744.58s]  Why did it just like broke?
[5745.22s -> 5750.49s]  Why can't I show it?
[5754.71s -> 5755.21s]  I'm like.
[5760.76s -> 5762.27s]  I'm like.
[5772.92s -> 5775.32s]  I'm like.
[5776.62s -> 5777.98s]  Why is it upside down?
[5788.89s -> 5790.65s]  All right, all right, all right.
[5790.65s -> 5791.85s]  I got to move on.
[5791.85s -> 5793.05s]  I got to move on.
[5795.78s -> 5796.50s]  I'm moving on.
[5796.50s -> 5797.22s]  That's funny.
[5797.22s -> 5798.26s]  That's cool.
[5798.26s -> 5798.90s]  Hey, I'm cool.
[5798.90s -> 5799.54s]  Hey, that's cool.
[5799.54s -> 5800.90s]  You got me on your, in your bar.
[5800.90s -> 5801.46s]  That's pretty cool.
[5802.02s -> 5804.95s]  It's a video of the text.
[5805.67s -> 5806.47s]  All right.
[5806.47s -> 5807.35s]  That's fucking funny.
[5807.35s -> 5808.47s]  But I want to play the game.
[5809.27s -> 5821.90s]  You just showed the bar a video of the bar.
[5821.90s -> 5823.26s]  All right, I'm moving on.
[5823.26s -> 5823.98s]  It's funny.
[5823.98s -> 5824.70s]  It's cool.
[5824.70s -> 5825.50s]  It's funny.
[5825.50s -> 5826.86s]  I'm happy that I'm on your TV.
[5827.42s -> 5829.08s]  But that's it.
[5829.08s -> 5829.58s]  Let's go.
[5830.12s -> 5846.94s]  It's not just a TV, Jerma.
[5846.94s -> 5847.44s]  It is.
[5854.07s -> 5855.99s]  You've infiltrated their reality.
[5861.42s -> 5862.06s]  Okay.
[5862.06s -> 5863.10s]  Back to the video game.
[5872.58s -> 5873.78s]  You're stuck.
[5873.78s -> 5875.30s]  No, no, no, no.
[5875.30s -> 5876.26s]  It's funny for a minute.
[5876.26s -> 5877.86s]  But no, let's, let's, let's, let's move on.
[5885.26s -> 5886.54s]  Oh, we hate the video game.
[5889.10s -> 5892.20s]  What is all over my mouth?
[5918.42s -> 5918.92s]  Oh.
[5925.35s -> 5927.03s]  You need to put baby sensorys on.
[5927.03s -> 5928.15s]  No, no, no.
[5932.09s -> 5934.25s]  They just got me on their TV and it's fun.
[5934.25s -> 5934.89s]  And it's funny.
[5935.45s -> 5938.94s]  I don't want, I don't want to like fuck with them, right?
[5938.94s -> 5941.82s]  Like that's, I'd rather just like kind of end it there.
[5946.78s -> 5948.22s]  It's cool that I'm on the TV though.
[5948.22s -> 5948.62s]  It is.
[5948.62s -> 5950.22s]  I find that really, really, that's really sweet.
[5950.86s -> 5968.60s]  Did you ever beat Hollow Knight off stream?
[5972.23s -> 5973.91s]  That's a really interesting question, actually.
[5982.55s -> 5984.71s]  No, I didn't.
[5984.71s -> 5986.95s]  I really wanted to, but I just didn't find the opportunity to.
[5987.51s -> 5991.69s]  All right, let's go this way.
[5992.33s -> 6007.43s]  No, I did not.
[6007.43s -> 6007.99s]  What the fuck?
[6015.80s -> 6022.87s]  Okay.
[6036.52s -> 6037.08s]  How is magic?
[6037.08s -> 6037.80s]  Magic is actually...
[6040.76s -> 6041.26s]  Really fun.
[6045.19s -> 6045.91s]  I like it a lot.
[6046.47s -> 6047.83s]  I like the combo magic.
[6048.47s -> 6050.33s]  Kind of magic plus.
[6051.29s -> 6052.90s]  Oh my gosh.
[6052.90s -> 6054.74s]  That's not what I wanted to do.
[6054.74s -> 6055.14s]  Okay.
[6074.15s -> 6076.73s]  You want to fight with me?
[6079.45s -> 6080.17s]  Is this a summon?
[6080.57s -> 6083.45s]  As fellow tarnished, we must each follow our own guidance.
[6084.17s -> 6086.97s]  Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.
[6087.53s -> 6090.90s]  Apologies, as fellow tarnished...
[6090.90s -> 6092.58s]  Okay, so I can summon you for the fight.
[6093.14s -> 6094.10s]  Whatever that fight is.
[6094.98s -> 6096.66s]  That was burp.
[6097.70s -> 6098.20s]  Okay.
[6110.87s -> 6114.31s]  I'm imagining that's probably happening very, very soon here.
[6114.31s -> 6114.95s]  Very soon.
[6119.58s -> 6120.22s]  Nice.
[6120.22s -> 6120.78s]  Another charge.
[6121.42s -> 6127.16s]  I haven't been able to use my horse in like six hours of gameplay.
[6127.16s -> 6127.66s]  Damn.
[6128.36s -> 6131.79s]  Okay.
[6132.11s -> 6134.64s]  This looks...
[6135.20s -> 6136.64s]  This is gonna be actually pretty bad.
[6137.71s -> 6138.59s]  I think I'm gonna go...
[6146.32s -> 6148.56s]  I think I'm gonna upgrade some weapons.
[6149.61s -> 6151.37s]  At least a couple times.
[6151.37s -> 6152.25s]  Or at least...
[6153.05s -> 6158.36s]  Because I don't...
[6158.36s -> 6160.60s]  My weapons are all plus one or plus zero.
[6161.32s -> 6170.06s]  I gotta kill the ad.
[6176.20s -> 6176.70s]  Shit.
[6184.62s -> 6185.74s]  Can I backstab?
[6186.54s -> 6187.04s]  I wonder.
[6189.37s -> 6191.13s]  Can I get like on his like leg or something?
[6192.81s -> 6210.44s]  This is bad.
[6210.44s -> 6212.04s]  Can't like break his leg?
[6217.00s -> 6220.30s]  Really?
[6221.16s -> 6239.52s]  Ooh, there it is.
[6259.45s -> 6265.45s]  Pain in the ass.
[6265.45s -> 6265.95s]  All right.
[6266.57s -> 6267.53s]  Do I have mana?
[6267.53s -> 6268.03s]  No.
[6269.72s -> 6270.22s]  I don't.
[6270.76s -> 6273.66s]  This guy sounds like a Scooby-Doo villain.
[6280.64s -> 6281.84s]  Ooh, I forgot about that.
[6282.48s -> 6289.50s]  The weapon art is actually incredible.
[6296.48s -> 6297.20s]  Uh-oh.
[6297.20s -> 6303.20s]  Okay, well that's the boss right there.
[6313.20s -> 6313.52s]  Item?
[6313.52s -> 6314.80s]  Well, let me level up one more time.
[6314.80s -> 6316.32s]  I have enough souls almost.
[6316.32s -> 6318.09s]  Give me a minute.
[6318.09s -> 6319.18s]  Is a bonfire...
[6319.18s -> 6320.30s]  Wait, is a bonfire in there?
[6320.94s -> 6323.29s]  Is there really?
[6334.41s -> 6335.61s]  Oh, okay.
[6336.25s -> 6350.64s]  Get over here.
[6350.64s -> 6354.25s]  What are these things?
[6354.25s -> 6354.89s]  Where am I going?
[6356.17s -> 6360.20s]  Ooh, okay.
[6360.20s -> 6360.70s]  Nice.
[6361.00s -> 6361.88s]  I think it's gonna get up.
[6361.88s -> 6363.16s]  So I'm just gonna take this thing away.
[6363.96s -> 6366.22s]  Where's this bonfire?
[6367.02s -> 6373.88s]  Oh, there it is.
[6373.88s -> 6374.38s]  Okay.
[6375.88s -> 6376.38s]  Sweet.
[6388.68s -> 6390.99s]  How many hours until you're gonna jump attack?
[6390.99s -> 6392.67s]  I'm saying at least probably two or three.
[6393.39s -> 6401.18s]  Shit.
[6401.18s -> 6401.74s]  4,200.
[6401.74s -> 6404.54s]  How many, uh, so how many rune, uh, crunchy things do I have?
[6405.66s -> 6408.06s]  One.
[6408.44s -> 6412.36s]  All right, let me, uh, let me just get to...
[6413.16s -> 6414.46s]  I'm gonna kill some of these guys.
[6418.68s -> 6421.40s]  Because I definitely want to get to enough.
[6422.04s -> 6423.02s]  So I don't...
[6423.10s -> 6435.48s]  I'm gonna die probably 500 times in this boss.
[6435.48s -> 6436.12s]  Hey, hey!
[6437.15s -> 6438.19s]  Settle down.
[6438.19s -> 6448.11s]  Wait, he's jumped up?
[6460.43s -> 6464.03s]  You are so slow like everybody else in this fucking whole universe!
[6464.99s -> 6475.20s]  I'm the developer of this indie game.
[6475.20s -> 6476.80s]  I just want to let you know that you really should...
[6476.80s -> 6477.30s]  I...
[6477.68s -> 6479.84s]  Okay, I'll try.
[6480.48s -> 6491.98s]  Sorcery is so good.
[6493.05s -> 6498.48s]  Although, I think actually using like a two-handed weapon would be...
[6502.30s -> 6503.96s]  You're still alive.
[6504.76s -> 6511.12s]  I just, let me get a few more souls and we'll be good.
[6511.60s -> 6522.49s]  Two-handed is pretty good.
[6522.49s -> 6525.64s]  Ooh, what do we have here?
[6526.44s -> 6532.94s]  And I'm gonna put it into, uh, stamina or vitality.
[6533.50s -> 6537.68s]  When are you gonna let us have a turn?
[6542.01s -> 6542.57s]  Just get it!
[6546.76s -> 6547.32s]  All right, fine.
[6547.32s -> 6547.96s]  I will P...
[6547.96s -> 6551.64s]  I will PS4 screen share play with you guys.
[6552.36s -> 6553.24s]  But you have to share.
[6555.48s -> 6558.27s]  Where am I going?
[6558.27s -> 6563.68s]  Okay, so this is just right here.
[6564.24s -> 6566.40s]  Although, I don't really want to do this right now.
[6572.78s -> 6573.74s]  Just get it, forehead.
[6573.74s -> 6574.14s]  I know.
[6574.14s -> 6575.18s]  It's 60 fucking bucks.
[6575.18s -> 6575.50s]  I know.
[6575.50s -> 6580.12s]  It's not like two dollars, I feel you.
[6581.60s -> 6583.60s]  All right, this is another skip back here.
[6595.34s -> 6597.66s]  So, what's the point of that skip?
[6597.66s -> 6598.70s]  It like doesn't really have a...
[6599.42s -> 6602.59s]  And does it really have that much of a purpose?
[6602.59s -> 6604.03s]  Because there's a bonfire literally right there.
[6605.74s -> 6607.02s]  It's kind of a weird place for that.
[6615.34s -> 6616.70s]  Hmm, okay.
[6616.70s -> 6619.37s]  I still need a few more souls.
[6619.93s -> 6621.39s]  Let's fight the boss, the loser.
[6621.39s -> 6622.03s]  I don't...
[6622.03s -> 6624.19s]  I'm gonna die to the boss.
[6625.71s -> 6628.75s]  So, I need to get to the souls required to fight this boss and not...
[6630.19s -> 6631.63s]  And not lose all the stuff that I have.
[6632.27s -> 6642.35s]  I think that's enough.
[6642.35s -> 6642.59s]  What is it?
[6642.59s -> 6643.39s]  4,600?
[6643.39s -> 6644.03s]  4,500?
[6644.67s -> 6649.53s]  And yeah, I have to go upgrade my stuff too.
[6650.25s -> 6651.85s]  All right, I'm doing endurance.
[6656.43s -> 6657.63s]  And we're traveling.
[6657.63s -> 6659.82s]  I'm going out of here.
[6661.24s -> 6665.12s]  I'm going to the blacksmith, which is...
[6665.12s -> 6665.60s]  Where is the...
[6666.40s -> 6667.28s]  This place, right?
[6667.28s -> 6671.08s]  Yeah, because I have to upgrade something.
[6671.08s -> 6672.12s]  I can't just...
[6672.12s -> 6673.00s]  Plus one.
[6673.00s -> 6673.48s]  It's awful.
[6674.28s -> 6676.20s]  It's very bad.
[6676.84s -> 6682.19s]  Where is he?
[6687.36s -> 6689.36s]  I got a few new weapons as well.
[6689.36s -> 6692.00s]  So, I need to examine what I want to do here.
[6692.80s -> 6694.72s]  Because I actually...
[6694.72s -> 6696.00s]  The claws are pretty good.
[6696.00s -> 6696.96s]  The claws are fast.
[6697.60s -> 6703.39s]  Let's take a look.
[6711.60s -> 6712.32s]  Yeah, I have...
[6717.05s -> 6717.61s]  Why not have?
[6717.61s -> 6717.93s]  There are...
[6719.21s -> 6720.33s]  I'm speaking of runes.
[6731.15s -> 6732.91s]  Well, back to what we were doing.
[6732.91s -> 6735.39s]  I'm going to just go farm for like five seconds.
[6736.43s -> 6737.15s]  Just get...
[6737.87s -> 6738.27s]  Wherever.
[6738.27s -> 6738.83s]  It doesn't matter.
[6740.19s -> 6746.19s]  I could sell something, but I don't want to.
[6746.19s -> 6751.56s]  I really only need like a few hundred.
[6751.56s -> 6752.44s]  How much do these guys give?
[6757.21s -> 6759.37s]  All right.
[6759.37s -> 6760.73s]  Yeah, I'm just going to kill like a few things.
[6765.21s -> 6776.75s]  Oh my god.
[6776.75s -> 6778.11s]  This guy has to farm.
[6778.11s -> 6778.91s]  He's so bad.
[6778.91s -> 6782.59s]  He can't just play the game as it shows up and progress as it happens.
[6784.11s -> 6802.91s]  Get away from me.
[6806.01s -> 6809.58s]  Okay, that should be enough to upgrade a couple things.
[6809.74s -> 6811.02s]  If I need to sell something, I will.
[6811.66s -> 6814.41s]  Well, thank you for those good meter day subs.
[6815.05s -> 6815.53s]  Artemis.
[6816.25s -> 6818.14s]  Of the blue.
[6818.14s -> 6827.16s]  I haven't like shouted any subs out in like two weeks.
[6830.62s -> 6832.30s]  I'm very focused on Elden Ring.
[6832.94s -> 6838.48s]  Okay, back to here.
[6840.92s -> 6846.57s]  Because he hates us.
[6846.57s -> 6846.97s]  No, I don't.
[6847.53s -> 6856.24s]  Wrong way.
[6856.96s -> 6874.24s]  Rodrik is cool as fuck.
[6874.24s -> 6875.04s]  I'm hyped for you to see him.
[6875.04s -> 6879.12s]  I'm looking forward to it.
[6879.12s -> 6880.48s]  I'm very much looking forward to it.
[6881.36s -> 6882.11s]  Okay.
[6884.40s -> 6890.22s]  So I've got this dagger, which I don't want to play with daggers.
[6890.22s -> 6890.78s]  It's too hard.
[6890.78s -> 6894.38s]  It literally takes forever to kill anything unless you stab things in the back.
[6896.51s -> 6899.15s]  Yes, doc, which is another one of those.
[6899.15s -> 6899.87s]  I don't want to do it.
[6902.32s -> 6903.28s]  Island Axe.
[6904.16s -> 6907.52s]  This is D in both and requires 12 strength.
[6912.40s -> 6913.28s]  It's probably the claws.
[6914.48s -> 6918.86s]  I have to pick something and I think it's going to be claws.
[6920.78s -> 6921.42s]  You're fast.
[6921.50s -> 6923.07s]  Bloodloss is pretty good.
[6924.11s -> 6929.90s]  Either that or I need to...
[6930.54s -> 6935.21s]  I mean, what does this look like with 12 strength?
[6935.77s -> 6936.25s]  I don't know.
[6936.25s -> 6938.03s]  Does this okay?
[6938.03s -> 6941.23s]  Once I upgrade this, does this scale with strength?
[6941.23s -> 6941.71s]  Probably.
[6942.59s -> 6951.08s]  Well, as it stands right now, I have to pick something and I'm going to pick the claws.
[6951.64s -> 6952.44s]  I'm going for it.
[6952.44s -> 6971.16s]  Claws have been upgraded and I'm gonna just put one into this.
[6971.16s -> 6978.97s]  I think because I haven't found another staff yet and like what the sorcery scaling like
[6978.97s -> 6979.77s]  needs to be better.
[6980.49s -> 6980.89s]  Right?
[6980.89s -> 6981.53s]  Like it just does.
[6983.29s -> 6986.60s]  So it's going to be doing a little bit more damage.
[6987.24s -> 6990.75s]  Okay.
[6990.75s -> 6993.95s]  I actually have like a plus two weapon now and not walking around like a dickhead.
[6994.75s -> 7002.99s]  And then we need to go back here and I am ready to attempt whatever this is.
[7003.63s -> 7007.58s]  Which was here, right?
[7008.78s -> 7011.40s]  Happy birthday to the guy in chat.
[7012.04s -> 7014.12s]  Happy birthday.
[7020.91s -> 7021.39s]  Hey, laugh.
[7021.39s -> 7022.43s]  Get the counter ready.
[7024.89s -> 7028.09s]  I'm going to stick with three and two.
[7028.09s -> 7029.53s]  I got the boys on standby.
[7029.53s -> 7035.02s]  If I need them, it's time to just let's all right.
[7035.02s -> 7035.74s]  Let's open the door.
[7037.79s -> 7038.27s]  Let's see it.
[7072.35s -> 7075.16s]  Got a big fucking accident.
[7075.16s -> 7076.52s]  It's going to be slow as shit.
[7079.72s -> 7081.24s]  Okay.
[7081.24s -> 7083.24s]  I thought this was four people riding the horse.
[7097.77s -> 7098.33s]  Oh man.
[7098.33s -> 7102.57s]  He's got, he's got, he's going to be swinging with like eight different arms.
[7103.93s -> 7106.17s]  I'll drink the grafted.
[7106.17s -> 7106.41s]  All right.
[7106.41s -> 7123.47s]  What do you got?
[7123.47s -> 7124.11s]  Show me your moves.
[7126.08s -> 7127.12s]  It's a lot of AOE.
[7137.02s -> 7138.54s]  Big AOE, big AOE.
[7138.54s -> 7139.50s]  And he goes through a ball.
[7140.14s -> 7149.55s]  Got a lot of health.
[7150.19s -> 7171.28s]  Whoa.
[7171.28s -> 7172.08s]  The AOE, right?
[7172.08s -> 7172.56s]  Got to be careful.
[7172.56s -> 7174.48s]  The AOE does a double AOE.
[7175.28s -> 7183.92s]  Holy shit.
[7183.92s -> 7184.48s]  All right, dude.
[7184.48s -> 7196.54s]  Come on one.
[7196.54s -> 7198.14s]  And then it's okay.
[7198.14s -> 7199.42s]  So you got to get the fuck away from that.
[7199.42s -> 7201.34s]  Hey, after he does that role, you're going to get the fuck out of here.
[7202.14s -> 7211.20s]  Is that what's he doing?
[7211.76s -> 7212.32s]  What is he doing?
[7213.12s -> 7217.29s]  Did he miss and hit himself?
[7225.76s -> 7226.48s]  Phase two.
[7226.48s -> 7226.80s]  Yep.
[7226.80s -> 7227.28s]  Of course.
[7252.25s -> 7254.62s]  Oh, it's got his head.
[7258.75s -> 7268.33s]  He has a flame thrower now.
[7268.89s -> 7275.85s]  I think it's time to jump over it.
[7275.85s -> 7285.21s]  Nope.
[7285.21s -> 7285.93s]  That's insane.
[7292.64s -> 7294.72s]  He looks like a resident evil villain.
[7295.36s -> 7296.00s]  Yeah, he does.
[7296.64s -> 7297.12s]  All right.
[7297.12s -> 7298.32s]  So it's very clear here.
[7300.06s -> 7302.22s]  So phase one is a lot of just...
[7302.22s -> 7302.70s]  I don't want to...
[7303.87s -> 7304.75s]  Here's what I have to do.
[7305.31s -> 7306.81s]  I have to get good.
[7308.03s -> 7312.51s]  And I have to get him all the way to phase two without casting a spell.
[7313.92s -> 7315.60s]  Because that's where it's going to be really important.
[7315.60s -> 7316.32s]  Let's see what I can do.
[7329.40s -> 7330.52s]  One.
[7330.52s -> 7330.76s]  Two.
[7355.85s -> 7357.13s]  Oh no.
[7357.13s -> 7357.93s]  The tornado.
[7361.21s -> 7362.41s]  What the fuck am I?
[7363.13s -> 7376.56s]  Trouble here.
[7377.36s -> 7394.38s]  How do I get that fucking bleed?
[7395.26s -> 7402.49s]  Shit.
[7402.49s -> 7403.61s]  It's faster than the other moves.
[7422.30s -> 7422.86s]  Oh, that's right.
[7422.86s -> 7423.58s]  I did get another seed.
[7423.58s -> 7423.90s]  Yep.
[7423.90s -> 7424.86s]  Thanks for reminding me.
[7424.86s -> 7425.79s]  Seriously.
[7425.79s -> 7426.35s]  I would have forgot.
[7426.35s -> 7426.67s]  I wouldn't know.
[7426.67s -> 7427.95s]  I would have absolutely forgot.
[7429.44s -> 7430.08s]  Blasks.
[7430.08s -> 7430.88s]  There we go.
[7430.88s -> 7431.12s]  Okay.
[7431.12s -> 7432.16s]  That's a big deal.
[7432.16s -> 7432.88s]  That's a huge deal.
[7436.32s -> 7440.00s]  I'm thinking four and two is fine for now.
[7440.00s -> 7440.48s]  We'll see if I...
[7440.48s -> 7440.80s]  I'm...
[7440.80s -> 7440.96s]  What?
[7440.96s -> 7441.36s]  We'll see.
[7441.36s -> 7442.40s]  We'll see.
[7442.40s -> 7445.64s]  We're going to call...
[7445.64s -> 7445.88s]  Yeah.
[7445.88s -> 7446.12s]  Yeah.
[7446.12s -> 7449.16s]  I got to get him to phase two without calling on the boys
[7450.12s -> 7451.80s]  and without casting a spell at him.
[7452.52s -> 7454.51s]  That's definitely doable.
[7454.51s -> 7455.47s]  And then I can hang back.
[7455.47s -> 7457.23s]  The boys can do what they need to do and I'll kill him.
[7457.95s -> 7481.37s]  That fucking pro hop, man.
[7481.61s -> 7483.21s]  Why does everybody have to do that?
[7484.25s -> 7493.16s]  I think I'm fighting the little brother of the guy that I fought fucking four hours ago.
[7512.33s -> 7519.23s]  What about that lady?
[7519.23s -> 7520.43s]  I think I can get it.
[7520.43s -> 7520.91s]  I got to get back.
[7520.91s -> 7521.95s]  I got to get to phase two again.
[7521.95s -> 7530.46s]  If I can get to phase two, then I bring out the boys and then I just...
[7530.46s -> 7531.82s]  And then I coward him.
[7532.46s -> 7541.23s]  I'm not doing a lot of damage to him though.
[7542.11s -> 7542.75s]  I'm only doing what?
[7542.75s -> 7543.63s]  Like 60 or 70.
[7543.63s -> 7544.51s]  It's going to take a little longer.
[7545.55s -> 7545.87s]  All right.
[7562.24s -> 7580.96s]  Really happy little tantrum.
[7580.96s -> 7581.36s]  That's fine.
[7588.59s -> 7590.27s]  He's just like just amorphous blob.
[7590.27s -> 7591.63s]  I don't even know when he's attacking.
[7592.43s -> 7594.83s]  He's just like moving his body around.
[7626.36s -> 7627.08s]  Parry?
[7627.08s -> 7628.76s]  Can you parry bosses in this game?
[7628.76s -> 7629.64s]  I feel like I tried.
[7633.58s -> 7634.46s]  Should I try parrying?
[7636.73s -> 7638.25s]  I think parrying has the same problem though.
[7642.46s -> 7643.42s]  That was as...
[7643.42s -> 7644.06s]  That was perfect.
[7644.62s -> 7648.19s]  Like that was actually a perfect parry and it didn't do anything.
[7648.19s -> 7666.92s]  I don't think so.
[7668.70s -> 7669.18s]  Yeah, you can't.
[7670.38s -> 7674.01s]  Guard counter works?
[7674.81s -> 7676.19s]  Oh, should I put it on?
[7676.99s -> 7685.24s]  Does that even lift lowly tarnished?
[7689.60s -> 7691.04s]  No, I got the right idea.
[7691.77s -> 7692.65s]  I got the right idea.
[7693.29s -> 7699.87s]  I just got to be patient, be good.
[7701.66s -> 7702.30s]  Go get it.
[7703.02s -> 7711.55s]  That is so slow.
[7712.51s -> 7714.56s]  Everybody's in slow motion.
[7715.52s -> 7724.08s]  All right.
[7724.08s -> 7724.40s]  But okay.
[7724.40s -> 7727.60s]  So he goes huge slow swing.
[7727.60s -> 7728.32s]  Dodge attack again.
[7729.04s -> 7729.92s]  You get hit by it again?
[7735.02s -> 7738.70s]  If I dodge that one, he swings immediately after you land
[7738.70s -> 7739.82s]  with the iframe.
[7739.82s -> 7742.24s]  Fuck this guy.
[7742.24s -> 7752.68s]  He attacks three times in one session.
[7752.68s -> 7753.72s]  Don't stop rolling.
[7754.28s -> 7755.16s]  But how do you...
[7755.16s -> 7755.88s]  What am I supposed to do?
[7755.88s -> 7756.68s]  Just run away?
[7769.53s -> 7770.33s]  Two.
[7770.33s -> 7772.28s]  That was a one, two.
[7772.28s -> 7772.84s]  That was three.
[7777.07s -> 7785.47s]  I have a better idea.
[7786.19s -> 7786.91s]  I got a better idea.
[7786.91s -> 7787.87s]  I'm going to use the weapon marker.
[7788.67s -> 7789.50s]  I got it.
[7789.50s -> 7791.05s]  Protect yourself.
[7791.05s -> 7791.69s]  Try this strat.
[7798.96s -> 7799.68s]  Boom, boom.
[7800.32s -> 7801.87s]  He only does two swings.
[7801.87s -> 7802.11s]  Okay.
[7802.83s -> 7804.24s]  So he goes boom, boom.
[7804.24s -> 7805.04s]  I think I can get behind him.
[7805.76s -> 7838.48s]  Build up stamina for a second here.
[7838.48s -> 7841.68s]  No.
[7843.20s -> 7852.59s]  It's so hard to tell if he's going to actually swing
[7852.59s -> 7853.95s]  or if he's going to do the fucking tornado.
[7853.95s -> 7854.83s]  It's the same animation.
[7855.63s -> 7863.32s]  Is that not...
[7863.32s -> 7865.16s]  Wait, does the dodge not have iframes?
[7865.16s -> 7866.60s]  Does the weapon art dodge have iframes?
[7866.60s -> 7867.16s]  It doesn't.
[7867.16s -> 7867.96s]  No, it doesn't.
[7867.96s -> 7868.44s]  Fuck.
[7868.44s -> 7869.08s]  I thought it did.
[7869.80s -> 7882.44s]  Damn slow ass goddamn boss.
[7882.44s -> 7882.92s]  Fuckers.
[7883.80s -> 7892.41s]  You have range?
[7892.41s -> 7892.81s]  I know.
[7892.81s -> 7894.65s]  I'm trying to get him to phase two without using it
[7894.65s -> 7895.93s]  because I'll burn through it all.
[7895.93s -> 7897.45s]  And then he's going to do the flamethrower
[7897.45s -> 7898.33s]  and he's going to kill me.
[7899.13s -> 7908.32s]  Should you do jump R2?
[7908.88s -> 7913.18s]  Quick jump.
[7913.18s -> 7914.22s]  Quick step and quick jump.
[7914.22s -> 7914.86s]  Have iframes?
[7915.58s -> 7916.83s]  What the hell are you guys doing?
[7917.95s -> 7920.01s]  Summon the boys?
[7921.15s -> 7921.39s]  All right.
[7921.39s -> 7921.95s]  I'm going to...
[7921.95s -> 7923.47s]  Let me try this one or two more times.
[7924.19s -> 7928.84s]  This is a good strategy as long as I can actually do it.
[7929.40s -> 7946.30s]  That extra second that he sits there
[7946.30s -> 7947.34s]  and you think he's going to swing
[7947.34s -> 7948.94s]  and he just fucking doesn't.
[7950.70s -> 7963.47s]  I hate it.
[7963.47s -> 7964.27s]  I hate it.
[7984.92s -> 7986.28s]  Just kill me already.
[7986.28s -> 7986.84s]  I'm going to try...
[7986.84s -> 7987.00s]  All right.
[7987.00s -> 7987.72s]  New strategy.
[8001.68s -> 8001.92s]  No.
[8002.64s -> 8002.88s]  Okay.
[8003.44s -> 8004.48s]  All right.
[8004.48s -> 8005.60s]  He holds it in the air
[8005.60s -> 8007.20s]  and just like his dickhead brother,
[8007.84s -> 8008.56s]  he goes like this.
[8013.40s -> 8014.36s]  So it's on the...
[8014.36s -> 8016.28s]  You wait for the two pumps
[8016.28s -> 8017.80s]  and then he'll do it.
[8017.80s -> 8026.59s]  So he puts his arm up.
[8029.79s -> 8030.11s]  Okay.
[8030.11s -> 8030.83s]  There and there he does.
[8030.83s -> 8031.71s]  All right.
[8031.71s -> 8035.13s]  Yeah.
[8035.13s -> 8035.93s]  He's a two pump.
[8036.73s -> 8037.69s]  What does that mean?
[8037.69s -> 8038.73s]  I don't think I want to say that out loud.
[8040.20s -> 8041.24s]  I don't want to say what you just...
[8041.24s -> 8042.28s]  I'm not saying that out loud.
[8051.45s -> 8052.25s]  Yeah.
[8052.25s -> 8052.41s]  Okay.
[8052.41s -> 8053.61s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8053.61s -> 8054.65s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8054.65s -> 8055.37s]  What the fuck?
[8075.02s -> 8075.82s]  They're all slow.
[8076.54s -> 8081.63s]  He's so fucking slow.
[8081.63s -> 8107.04s]  it's so fucking slow they're so fucking slow oh you're scaring people all right let's go
[8107.68s -> 8143.84s]  i gotta at least get him back down to 50 like i dude what the fuck man what what why an elder
[8143.84s -> 8147.84s]  ring do they want you just to turn and just run the other direction to the other side of the map
[8148.48s -> 8155.53s]  like oh he's doing that move just run all the way to the back and like we're playing it's like
[8155.53s -> 8181.02s]  fucking recess playing like fucking tag the boys suck they're actually doing pretty good
[8181.58s -> 8249.10s]  i just got lucky there oh my god it was like homing missile get this shit out of there
[8250.46s -> 8341.53s]  run run run run run run what is he doing what is he doing what is he doing what is he doing what
[8341.53s -> 8349.72s]  is he doing oh wait i can just smash on him there okay i can just smash on him i don't know why i
[8349.72s -> 8353.24s]  thought he was gonna explode i could get in there and just like wail on him all right
[8354.73s -> 8358.73s]  right okay so when he does that just absolutely beat that lever every little shit out
[8359.85s -> 8375.28s]  all right let's go at least i get to see it again here's another attack with the arm
[8387.21s -> 8397.34s]  round up in the air okay fire breathing just goes oh fuck bad how do i get away from him
[8398.38s -> 8407.15s]  i just can't get away from him why is it taking me so long to do that dude
[8410.96s -> 8415.76s]  i'm gonna unbind the left stick by the way it's just such a hindrance it just fucks you every
[8415.76s -> 8482.36s]  single time get me out what huh what happened a fire hot fire all right i got the strategy here
[8482.36s -> 8488.60s]  here's the strategy probably is when he all right when he goes down wham wham wham wham wham wham
[8489.32s -> 8498.51s]  when he's breathing the fire you can usually get a few good hits in all right let's get this
[8498.51s -> 8508.60s]  going here honestly you know what phase one i think is is magic because i can get them
[8508.60s -> 8513.15s]  down reliably hopefully let's see what i can do should i maybe just walk the magic just get
[8513.15s -> 8520.80s]  in there and beat this shit up let's see i got of course like i had to walk right into that like
[8520.80s -> 8542.14s]  because who the fuck even tells me an idiot just want to do a single fucking move unbind it i have
[8542.14s -> 8550.52s]  to unbind it it's such a bad place to put that i would rather have no ability to crouch than
[8550.52s -> 8596.35s]  have to crouch in the middle of fucking boss fight let's go get in there oh is it close enough
[8596.99s -> 8641.90s]  come on fucking what what's happening it's a new move i haven't seen that shit too greedy
[8677.61s -> 8682.54s]  is it actually a homing missile that's stupid it is it actually is
[8683.50s -> 8728.40s]  here comes shit homing missile attacks you and it goes 100 miles per hour i'm burning through
[8728.64s -> 8741.61s]  all right i gotta like i feel like i'm not doing enough damage like even when i hit them it just
[8741.61s -> 8746.33s]  feels like it's i'm doing like nothing let me see if i can actually handle this forget about the
[8746.33s -> 8750.59s]  boys for now let me practice for a minute because like seriously if it's just about
[8756.99s -> 8759.79s]  magic actually is probably gonna be a bad idea in the second phase because of how
[8761.63s -> 8819.60s]  fuck that he turned around it's fuck dude you reach across the whole game
[8820.40s -> 8831.39s]  my fucking god it's over let's put gravestones fucking scan it around the whole area and they'll
[8831.39s -> 8850.41s]  run into him he's in the air and he just goes like like i would rather just be like final
[8850.41s -> 8855.61s]  destination like there's nothing here it's just me and you and like a black screen behind us i
[8855.61s -> 8879.00s]  don't want i don't want to run into this shit let's go i keep thinking he's gonna jump in the
[8879.00s -> 8884.12s]  air and do the big two-handed swing but he doesn't just so hard to tell sometimes what he's actually
[8884.12s -> 8899.04s]  gonna do he has the same telegraph with like two three different moves or he does that shit and
[8899.04s -> 8905.04s]  like what are you gonna do to get stuck in it and that shit is like driving in a blizzard it takes
[8905.04s -> 8919.44s]  up the whole fucking screen you can't see where you're going i'm angry i keep being like a tenth
[8919.44s -> 8936.32s]  of a second late on that all right we're going we're gonna go combo andy here okay don't combo
[8936.32s -> 8961.37s]  andy let's see what i mean in a minute stop doing fucking moves like do you have a fucking
[8961.37s -> 8985.05s]  stamina bar trying to avoid the fucking huge tombstones they got these like giant like
[8985.05s -> 8993.08s]  10 commandment slabs that are scattered around the whole fucking area all right we're going
[8993.08s -> 9096.70s]  combo combo this video game seriously like it was under the ground it was under the goddamn ground
[9096.70s -> 9143.88s]  it was like fucking tornado one of the blacks oh that can hurt you dude i can't fucking see
[9143.88s -> 9164.08s]  through these stupid gravestones man come on i'm so fucking dead let's just come on
[9165.28s -> 9179.56s]  he says so many different moves and he has 500 fucking million health like even when i get him
[9179.56s -> 9192.24s]  like down to like i only have joe biden wouldn't die to this boss i'm not sure joe biden would know
[9192.24s -> 9200.64s]  where x was on the xbox controller i don't think most people over the age of 60 would know where
[9200.64s -> 9209.64s]  the x on the xbox controller is so i don't think so i think i got an advantage time to angry flight
[9210.36s -> 9236.80s]  and i'll show you what i mean by that shit dude you have to seriously go across the whole fucking
[9236.80s -> 9266.32s]  game take dude left stick being crouched what were they thinking what were they thinking
[9268.96s -> 9289.55s]  what were they thinking i have to unbind it it's like fucking awful what can i change it to
[9290.19s -> 9302.25s]  there's nothing the amount of times that like i'm moving around and the left stick just actually
[9302.25s -> 9307.90s]  clicks in and he crouches it's just like what the fuck dude you're down on the d-pad that's
[9307.90s -> 9328.19s]  actually not a bad idea no but that potions though find it to the xbox button what can i make it
[9328.91s -> 9343.37s]  what is up on the d-pad switch sorcery what is uh no i don't know what i can even make it
[9343.93s -> 9351.77s]  i'm just gonna leave it without any okay yeah it's not happening now i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[9351.77s -> 9360.06s]  unbind it put it on right stick that's actually not a bad idea no right stick is um is lock on
[9360.06s -> 9386.01s]  that's a huge deal i'm just gonna unbind it dude that's so irritating you really have to put it
[9386.01s -> 9416.86s]  in the ground like the second one sometimes goes underground i'm in trouble actually you know what
[9416.86s -> 9420.94s]  i need i need more flasks i think i have to go adventure before i continue to do this
[9421.66s -> 9437.26s]  because as a caster losing a few flasks is like horrible horrible horrible i'm at like a
[9437.26s -> 9445.07s]  disadvantage every fight because i just have like three healing yeah i mean i'm doing like 25 percent
[9445.07s -> 9456.30s]  of his bar that's awesome oh man a little bit longer it's actually a little better i could
[9456.30s -> 9464.60s]  probably try just not using magic at all and just having five uh those flasks might actually be
[9464.60s -> 9516.46s]  better the bleed stacks i think are way better casting i think i just have to actually hit him
[9520.54s -> 9556.28s]  run not again right after it come on no i thought i got under it i didn't get under it
[9556.84s -> 9604.80s]  oh man you just get so caught holy shit i didn't think i was gonna go that far
[9605.52s -> 9611.15s]  oh
[9611.71s -> 9616.00s]  how long does he do it for how fucking long do you do it for
[9617.52s -> 9631.44s]  i should have gone forward but i just like he was just at an angle on me oh my god all right
[9632.32s -> 9641.53s]  i've made a decision there's the decision i'm not doing magic magic i think it just takes up
[9641.53s -> 9650.11s]  too much i'd rather have like six heals get up there actually hit this motherfucker lead him
[9650.19s -> 9700.84s]  and i think that's gonna be better let's go dude he didn't do the jump how did he not do
[9700.84s -> 9709.77s]  my damn rock next to me this little fucking ledge it had to be the stupid fucking ledge
[9709.77s -> 9715.12s]  i like bumping into the ledge it's like somebody came in and played like fucking
[9715.12s -> 9719.12s]  roller coaster tycoon and just didn't understand the terrain tool just fucking moved it all over
[9719.12s -> 9751.71s]  the place just die just die that move is like a full three seconds just go like one two three
[9752.51s -> 9767.82s]  calm down honey let's get you some tea you know i just i want to take that tool in roller coaster
[9767.82s -> 9775.18s]  tycoon that like you just drag it over and like smooth out these fucking bumps all right settle
[9775.18s -> 9877.44s]  down over an opening no you don't oh my god i'm not doing enough damage how many times did i hit him
[9877.44s -> 9884.57s]  i did like fucking big 10 of his bar why do i dodge to the left because it's burned into my brain
[9884.57s -> 9890.97s]  dodging right like it's hard to do for me get in there blood-borne style my problem with getting
[9890.97s -> 9897.21s]  in their blood-borne style is the guy is so fucking slow that like it's not like a dodge here we go
[9897.21s -> 9901.61s]  fight fight dodge it's just it's it's this slow ass encounter i just get i get myself killed
[9907.08s -> 9910.68s]  that's another reason why i can't do that the guy has like a fight me counter
[9911.72s -> 9914.84s]  this boss has a fight me counter where you're not supposed to fight it
[9914.84s -> 9934.81s]  even to go like this to his head use the quick step yeah but the quick step it's i don't know
[9934.81s -> 9939.37s]  sometimes it's hard to gauge sometimes like when you can and can't do it because if you use quick
[9939.37s -> 9943.61s]  step when you're locked on sometimes you'll just spin around it could be kind of jarring
[9945.05s -> 9951.50s]  i don't even know what direction i was just trying to go there he said your build is awful
[9952.14s -> 9961.60s]  i mean it's great for fighting like regular enemies but it's sorcery man like if you sometimes if you
[9961.60s -> 9971.92s]  don't go full sorcery you're you're in for some shit i would adopt all right hold on let me let
[9971.92s -> 9979.34s]  me get this right all right i'm gonna give him like one or two more attempts so then i'm gonna
[9979.34s -> 9997.05s]  go to something else is this why all the battle mages died out just do six magic flasks and
[9997.05s -> 10005.21s]  fucking run away it's so but i'll i will run out i will run out of flasks i can definitely do it
[10005.77s -> 10013.31s]  it's just here's the problem splitting between intelligence and dexterity is making both my
[10013.31s -> 10020.81s]  magic and my actual swings not as good as they could be right eventually it'll even out eventually
[10020.81s -> 10035.23s]  it should be fine but for now now i have to rely on both i could do it all right no more no more
[10036.35s -> 10059.02s]  i'm doing both headphones don't nobody talk to me i fucking hate that it's so dumb it doesn't
[10059.02s -> 10107.95s]  even give you a chance to fucking attack him he just hits you you have another move with that
[10107.95s -> 10164.75s]  fucking combo oh fuck off just swing it dude come on it's so stupid it's like his game is
[10164.75s -> 10204.06s]  lagging and he's not falling down i'm so dead god are you supposed to close the gap with this
[10204.06s -> 10227.58s]  fucking guy hitting the second phase consistently with magic at least it's not the trees the tree
[10227.58s -> 10234.11s]  center was had like a tactic you use the horse which by the way where's the fucking horse
[10234.91s -> 10239.16s]  why can i play with it where's the horse i was the where the fuck is the horse
[10239.96s -> 10285.56s]  where's the horse try this what the fuck boys don't help here they die in one aoe
[10286.44s -> 10349.28s]  on where where where where where i'm a little baby i don't like hard games dude i can't even
[10349.28s -> 10421.40s]  fucking see what he's doing dude god i tried to wait too what the fuck he does that stupid
[10421.40s -> 10428.84s]  shit man it's so hard to it's so hard to not get juked when he has 50 other moves he does
[10429.80s -> 10584.01s]  no stop doing this move what the fuck man dude he's done this like so many times in a row
[10587.15s -> 10620.48s]  i can't get a position on him he's talking strategy by the way oh my god i
[10620.48s -> 10638.94s]  i know i was doing so good god last one get in there boom boom get it my god can you seriously
[10638.94s -> 10729.53s]  the fucking aoe moves how many are you going to do in a row what the fuck oh my god what
[10730.17s -> 10760.06s]  he got agreed for the bleed i know it's just he has so he has so many different kind okay here's
[10760.06s -> 10767.20s]  the thing about elden ring listen to me they all have so many different kinds of moves so like
[10767.84s -> 10775.29s]  on a scale of one to ten like area attacks like short attacks quick attacks long attacks from a
[10775.29s -> 10783.61s]  scale of one to ten they got them all they have from one to ten it's so difficult to like predict
[10783.61s -> 10789.31s]  what they're going to do because they have so many different kinds of moves this is not like the
[10789.31s -> 10796.84s]  dancer that just like spins in a circle five times well i wasn't ready for that
[10797.56s -> 10822.73s]  can i just say can i go can i jump over that just jump but jump where jump over a lot of things
[10824.83s -> 10832.64s]  i feel like i've tried to jump over aoe moves and i just get killed the ground pound can be
[10832.64s -> 10838.03s]  jumped over can it i feel like i've tried that a few times i'll try it let's see what happens
[10838.59s -> 10853.45s]  but that okay not that one that's not a ground pound yeah that one when he goes
[10853.93s -> 10865.42s]  ah i would actually save a lot of time if it actually works i have to go around his right side
[10873.85s -> 10880.01s]  you have to dodge roll the second one so you have to go like bang bang i feel like he swings
[10880.01s -> 10893.82s]  too fast to dodge the second one after you get the eye cramp you're doing good at the beginning i
[10893.82s -> 10915.76s]  actually that last one was not bad just trying to like figure out should i do our right trigger
[10916.72s -> 10922.62s]  should i do a heavy attack maybe a heavy attack is better than just one or two i wonder how much
[10922.62s -> 10960.67s]  bleed how come is there a bleed counter that i can see i think that's better can't get away from that
[10960.67s -> 11055.52s]  one it also doesn't have this body goes off the screen too what the fuck i have no stamina
[11056.64s -> 11087.74s]  fucking can't see when he goes behind a fucking tree dude come on when he's like you can't see
[11087.74s -> 11093.63s]  what he's doing i can't fucking see him he does like the roll and it gets stuck somewhere and
[11093.63s -> 11107.76s]  then it's like all right what the fuck are you gonna do next fuck you fuck you oh be careful
[11107.76s -> 11112.16s]  he might get like stuck behind like the fucking giant blockade dragon and then uh good luck
[11112.16s -> 11184.16s]  finally he did he shot a projectile at you behind there by the way good luck oh dude really again
[11184.16s -> 11192.99s]  with this fucking bullshit like i if you're not at like the exact precise place you need to be
[11192.99s -> 11204.68s]  when he's randomly will do that that was such a good start too it's just like the dude remember
[11204.68s -> 11212.68s]  can you look at my bumble profile i can't get any matches um i don't know he's incredibly mad
[11215.02s -> 11239.34s]  this guy's fucking hard i meet his fucking fingers you're not as mad as last night i feel
[11239.34s -> 11307.93s]  like i'm playing the same boss as last night i feel like these are the same people okay i think
[11307.93s -> 11312.09s]  beginning as a fourth attack there it takes a fucking so long to do it how do you even remember
[11313.13s -> 11335.40s]  i keep i'm just so i can't get the slow attacks it's always been a problem
[11335.40s -> 11340.25s]  in every from software game i've ever played and this game is full of them
[11360.35s -> 11363.71s]  summon the lady i don't i don't want to summon i want to beat it on my own
[11364.67s -> 11369.23s]  i don't want to summon i want to beat it on my own without any help
[11370.03s -> 11377.23s]  any outside sources i got him down to like 10 like three or four times now i can do it
[11377.87s -> 11398.01s]  got stuck in the fucking gravestones they don't even need to fucking be here why are they even in
[11398.01s -> 11423.02s]  here what like if the enemies can get stuck on that stuff delete it why is it here so here's the
[11423.02s -> 11429.07s]  problem building bleed stacks on this guy's heart because by the time you almost have enough he
[11429.07s -> 11438.81s]  might just do the whirlwind move and then you just get fucking hit by it all right this is the last
[11438.81s -> 11444.22s]  one before i go do something else because obviously i need like another point in this weapon
[11444.94s -> 11474.38s]  or i need another point sorcery or something it's in the air my i can't dodge that second attack
[11481.92s -> 11485.12s]  yeah you can't dodge the second attack there's not enough time
[11487.10s -> 11490.30s]  once you by the time you land he's already swinging his right hand or his left hand
[11491.02s -> 11505.69s]  your armor is at zero percent durability all right last one for real actually last one last
[11505.69s -> 11528.78s]  one for real see what i mean like you just can't you can't stay near him fucking gravestones
[11529.66s -> 11547.74s]  yeah see he fucking hates him too he's pissed too he's sitting there going like all of why is
[11547.74s -> 11554.06s]  this here who put this here why the fuck is this light post here he's as mad as i am don't call me
[11554.06s -> 11601.85s]  mad he's bad too i'm getting hit by the axe it's hard to get that second dodge it's gonna be perfect
[11637.96s -> 11724.04s]  no dude it's give me the other blade give me the other blade dude come on i'm a mad i wonder like
[11724.04s -> 11727.88s]  i don't know if you just dodged through it i feel like you can still get hit by it
[11734.46s -> 11738.62s]  when he does the big fire thing like you have to run around him right you have to get around him
[11738.62s -> 11743.58s]  but you can't run to the left because he'll just hit you with it did you dodge through it like can
[11743.58s -> 11747.90s]  i go through that fire i feel like you can't i tried jumping over before and you still get
[11747.90s -> 11758.49s]  hit by like the residual hitbox like you can jump over the fire can i actually jump it
[11758.49s -> 11808.33s]  just hit last attempt i'm a liar i'm a liar god fucking get the shit out of the god damn place
[11808.33s -> 11809.85s]  come on where's the blade
[11872.68s -> 11958.94s]  get rid of the fucking stupid scenery why is it here what what is that ending what
[12012.03s -> 12027.72s]  do you understand why now i what the fuck is the point of some of this scenery bullshit i'm sitting
[12027.72s -> 12034.76s]  like in a fucking tree i had to burn through like three or four flasks that's so stupid
[12035.56s -> 12167.55s]  it's not worth dying over no he went the way with it i was going he went the i was jerry he went my
[12167.55s -> 12299.40s]  way run away far away we cannot harm you wowie wowie wowie wowie he had to do that right there
[12304.14s -> 12310.14s]  he had to do that right there i tried to get up and like jump but it was just too late i was too
[12310.14s -> 12319.39s]  i was on the ground already oh man i was right there that's just so unfortunate like the fire
[12319.39s -> 12327.60s]  thing i can't jump over it i can't dodging through it is hard too i i if i had mana or something
[12327.60s -> 12456.65s]  fuck man come on sprint i gotta dodge through it like that way oh i'm so fucking far away it's
[12456.65s -> 12518.83s]  a different way i'm good god damn it i still don't get it i gotta get away from that shit
[12534.33s -> 12552.16s]  dude fuck you are a huge ass arm fuck off oh my fucking god dude i can't i just it's so much for
[12552.16s -> 12561.34s]  my brain to handle just choking on those fucking moves just so annoying i have to dodge right
[12561.42s -> 12592.97s]  through the middle what the fuck it's just like okay so here's my problem when he does the flame
[12592.97s -> 12598.73s]  thing right it's like he this too that's why there's like you have so many different random
[12598.73s -> 12603.85s]  fucking ass moves one of them is like a big cone in front of them and the other one is like a big
[12603.85s -> 12609.05s]  slow wave but it's like it's hard to tell which one of those fucking two stupid moves it's gonna
[12609.05s -> 12671.29s]  be because you can't dodge through the one that's in the front no bleed where's the bleed bro where's
[12671.29s -> 12695.64s]  the bleed seriously where's the bleed i had so many fucking times one two
[12698.04s -> 12841.15s]  it's even fucking longer than that fuck this goddamn game one dude no that was i dodged right
[12841.15s -> 12850.86s]  through it and i got hit by a piece of fire that i'm gonna i would like the referees to go back
[12850.86s -> 12855.18s]  and fucking take a look and see if that actually happened it's like the fire was gone and i like
[12855.18s -> 12964.41s]  touched it with like my heel too late too late fuck you i should have my steam in the bar was
[12964.41s -> 12976.30s]  a little too low friend dude it's the stupid fucking gravestones that was probably the one
[12976.94s -> 12982.54s]  just getting like trapped behind fucking objects you can't walk through and like the fact that
[12982.54s -> 12986.86s]  everything has fucking collision and the collision is like a full square around the goddamn thing
[12988.14s -> 12998.72s]  it's like you just get stuck and they're everywhere they're fucking everyone it's like how are you
[12998.72s -> 13007.42s]  supposed to fight this guy in a a like fucking two-lane highway right here that was absolutely
[13007.42s -> 13014.14s]  the one this guy's area just sucks like asshole fuck this area fighting this guy here different
[13014.22s -> 13021.24s]  elevations the gravestones the gigantic dragon ass tree that's here you gotta fight this guy
[13021.24s -> 13029.61s]  in like a 10 meter radius like here i'll i'm got i got it i got it this guy's fucking dead
[13031.37s -> 13038.24s]  this guy's fucking dead mad yeah because that's like the fourth or fifth time that a run gets
[13038.24s -> 13047.61s]  blown because there's a gravestone behind my body that i can't like i'm just dead put them like up
[13047.61s -> 13052.09s]  in the fucking vistas and shit like they don't have to be so many down here how many people have
[13052.09s -> 13059.05s]  died here this is like this how many gravestones are there in fucking elven ring all right let's
[13059.05s -> 13076.01s]  go i don't understand bleed i really don't that was like three auto attacks and it and it did
[13076.01s -> 13091.13s]  bleed i have done like 40 auto attacks and it doesn't happen is it a cooldown what bad place to
[13091.13s -> 13183.00s]  be i'm just being a fucking clumsy i'm alive i'm fine i'm fine i'm alive god damn it man
[13183.72s -> 13188.86s]  oh god fucking damn it like the one move that he couldn't do in the one spot that he couldn't do
[13188.86s -> 13195.85s]  it in the one move that would have hit me if i when i get up the instantly i fucking get up
[13201.29s -> 13209.34s]  stay close to him but dodging some of those aoe attacks that he has he's gonna get trapped
[13209.90s -> 13294.20s]  i need stamina i need stamina all right fuck you see that's why like and you get trapped in there
[13295.16s -> 13307.69s]  like what the fuck is hitting me behind you can't go near him is it happening behind him too
[13308.73s -> 13325.37s]  such bullshit god it's so much longer even when you think even when you think you're holding it for
[13325.37s -> 13358.51s]  long enough it's still not enough fuck now so much variance in speed one two wait it's so hard to
[13358.59s -> 13389.63s]  tell i'm not going near him man no not again
[13418.56s -> 13456.88s]  fuck you no you can't i thought no he stops and he does the two fireballs come on he stops and
[13456.88s -> 13461.60s]  he goes fireball fireball and the one time he fucking does it there's just too much variance
[13464.41s -> 13468.81s]  it's like how am i supposed to tell am i too far away am i too close the fucking goddamn
[13468.81s -> 13476.86s]  variables on these fights yeah i know i have full mana but man i've got a thing going on here and
[13476.86s -> 13488.28s]  i'm doing well changing changing it up is bad so all over the place when it comes to speed and
[13488.28s -> 13541.85s]  shit but he was not gonna do another move i would try to fuck you all right all right all right
[13541.85s -> 13565.32s]  fuck you piece of fucking dog shit i you know what i need to figure out what the actual strategy is
[13565.32s -> 13567.96s]  there because i keep fucking it up i just keep getting hit by it every time
[13603.53s -> 13606.33s]  get away from the fucking tree i'm not having this happen again
[13619.00s -> 13624.94s]  dude come the fuck on i don't care who you are that's a stupid fucking move i don't care who you
[13624.94s -> 13723.39s]  are i don't care what your complaint is wowie blade hot hot too hot hit him what
[13724.35s -> 13728.84s]  oh
[13734.92s -> 13750.17s]  that guy sucks that i sucked that guy sucked this game's not even fucking me it's a great i love it
[13750.89s -> 13759.00s]  what a what an experience really trying to get going and fight him and get him and kill him
[13759.95s -> 13765.24s]  it was uh that was a very very interesting thing to do we got him it took a lot it took a little
[13765.24s -> 13774.06s]  bit of perseverance i got a little heated there but you know it's okay we got him fuck that guy
[13774.06s -> 13781.76s]  and fuck that area those stones fuck the tree fuck the dragon on the tree and it looks beautiful
[13781.76s -> 13788.56s]  but it's no place to fight this is no place to fight a human or an animal or a beast or a legend
[13788.56s -> 13791.92s]  or a fighter it doesn't matter i don't care what we're fighting this and pick another place
[13792.56s -> 13797.15s]  like i would walk in here and be like dude all right you and i can fight but like can we just
[13797.15s -> 13802.11s]  like go like out in the open like let's do like a fair fight let's go do like a duel man
[13802.11s -> 13815.50s]  and dr seuss lyrics that sucked i just missed everything about that what did that say
[13816.06s -> 13829.80s]  reverence of garfield i missed that literally that whole thing i said would it say great ruin
[13829.80s -> 13836.96s]  can somebody explain it i literally skipped it i can't fucking dude i almost died at the very end
[13836.96s -> 13843.50s]  i would have fucking eaten my controller dude i really would have eaten my controller when i
[13843.50s -> 13848.30s]  was just casting and it's just nothing was hitting him did you notice i want you to rewind for a
[13848.30s -> 13855.18s]  second if you can for a moment it was hitting like a gravestone it was like hitting this thing
[13857.05s -> 13863.66s]  it wasn't though it was just a little too far away like i was out of range but i thought it
[13863.66s -> 13870.86s]  was hitting that thing and i was sitting here just going gravestone andy you know what i mean
[13870.86s -> 13878.57s]  i was about to fucking flip out i was gonna fucking freak out i thought it was actually
[13878.57s -> 13896.17s]  hitting that these these two main bosses so far have been fucking hell god all the tutorials
[13896.17s -> 13914.27s]  there okay they both have this like i know i've done this routine like 10 times already let's go
[13914.27s -> 13928.91s]  take a short break yeah i will i'm gonna get some more water what do you think hey so for those of
[13928.91s -> 13935.55s]  you that were saying sorcery hey casual you're a casual i beat that guy pretty much without it at
[13935.55s -> 13941.71s]  the very end i may have thrown out a a little a little dingy at him but i did that without
[13941.71s -> 13960.75s]  sorcery i need a break after watching strength 12 just to be able to use items what do you mean
[13960.75s -> 13985.45s]  that doesn't count um let's do 2020 16 i must have an i can actually do it again take the power of
[13985.45s -> 13992.78s]  its namesake be a finger reader yeah we're gonna take a break in a second i just want to get
[13992.78s -> 14005.23s]  situated oh where is that thing of course how many of you guys watch the stream muted you don't have
[14005.23s -> 14012.08s]  to listen to the guy complain for like an hour like is it at what at what point do i do this is
[14012.08s -> 14016.80s]  the streamer die like three four five six times ten times fifteen times in a row and then like
[14016.80s -> 14021.68s]  when they die this is how i would do it this is this is stress so when the streamer dies for like
[14021.68s -> 14027.60s]  the 15th time and his mouth goes that's what you just mute and he's gonna sit there and be like
[14038.44s -> 14046.52s]  and then when you when he goes into when they go into the boss door you unmute it so it just
[14046.52s -> 14052.72s]  it's if you get to watch the stream normally that's like that's actually a good idea that's
[14052.72s -> 14059.64s]  what i would be doing just every okay if i die 10 times in a row to boss just mute me after i die
[14068.72s -> 14085.64s]  you're always muted on my stream okay where is this item it's like this prime evil stone
[14085.64s -> 14099.58s]  or something whatever it was use this fp to mimic nearby objects where's this thing
[14104.28s -> 14108.06s]  what where is it you got godric's great rune you need to take it to the tower
[14108.86s -> 14116.65s]  i got two things though wasn't it i got two different things didn't i
[14117.37s -> 14126.65s]  or was that just explaining what that thing was all right let's take a break you got the
[14126.65s -> 14130.01s]  rune and his soul all right let's uh i'll be right back i'm gonna get some water i'm gonna
[14130.01s -> 14136.96s]  get a refill of maybe some green tea and i'll be back we'll keep going i took a break what happened
[14137.84s -> 14143.42s]  uh i gave up on the game i uh i just like a little too hard i think it's just like too much like i
[14143.42s -> 14149.42s]  if they patch out i got i haven't beat the guy uh if they patch out like 10 to 20 of the gravestones
[14149.42s -> 14153.50s]  then maybe i'll come back and try it again it's unfortunate but i'm gonna skip break when i come
[14153.50s -> 14594.91s]  back we'll play pit cross oh i didn't loop it i'm not even kidding they guys i had to go change my
[14594.91s -> 14605.56s]  clothes i was wet i was soaking wet like but that that shirt was as if somebody put it into the
[14605.56s -> 14615.63s]  washing machine sorry that took a little bit longer than it should have but i actually just
[14615.63s -> 14631.80s]  had to change my clothes i'm in like a different shirt now i'm in like a star wars shirt okay
[14632.52s -> 14643.74s]  so what's the last thing that just happened a spot but godric the gravestone um and that was an
[14643.74s -> 14653.88s]  intense fight i had to believe i was cooking up that one while i was taking a piss um okay i need
[14653.88s -> 14671.68s]  to my lips are dry chatters are saying you smell like cream corn um i think i smell like kind of
[14671.76s -> 14689.21s]  coconutty um with a hint of like a lavender and like sewer gas okay i can just i can go that way
[14689.21s -> 14702.68s]  or i can go back and start looking around let me see what's this way because wait i have his rune
[14702.68s -> 14716.72s]  and after all that
[14732.22s -> 14737.18s]  felt the same way i mean like me and this guy would be the same person
[14743.64s -> 14753.23s]  this weasel was godric was always looking down on me bloody deserve thanks to you

[14842.01s -> 14849.15s]  make sure i didn't miss any items over here which i don't think i did because this is just the boss

[15432.75s -> 15452.75s]  it's not you doors closed oh i'm gonna look at the painting
[15463.74s -> 15471.77s]  who's this isn't this place impressive the round table hall over quarters of the two fingers
[15472.73s -> 15478.16s]  and gathering place of champions who vie to become elder lord i never knew the guidance
[15478.16s -> 15485.84s]  bestowed upon us tarnished had such fantastic root although it's all a bit much for me in truth
[15486.48s -> 15493.52s]  i'm still looking for my own purpose your spells it's all a bit much for me in truth i'm still
[15493.52s -> 15515.08s]  looking for how many spells who has spells for captain hook oh it's this person oh it's the
[15515.08s -> 15528.19s]  finger reader
[15537.63s -> 15548.25s]  why is there a hand here
[15557.37s -> 15566.30s]  has taken its toll across the realm life lies in ruin pieces
[15567.42s -> 15578.38s]  foul curses and misery spread unabating but the greater will has not abandoned the realm
[15578.38s -> 15589.26s]  life that inhabits it so it is that the tarnished are guided by grace oops i'm sorry
[15590.06s -> 15603.74s]  are you that new tarnished until it was the tragical across the realm foul but the great
[15603.74s -> 15614.30s]  so it is brave to seek another of its kind to become the elder lord and restore the golden
[15614.70s -> 15616.06s]  seek another of its kind
[15620.38s -> 15635.76s]  i don't like this i don't like this this is weird touch the two fingers rapture what the hell that's
[15635.76s -> 15654.75s]  so weird
[15657.71s -> 15659.71s]  i feel like that's like attacking the world stone
[15672.51s -> 15678.91s]  so this is probably boss um boss shards boss weapons
[15679.71s -> 15691.69s]  who and you the strength of strength of the fingers
[15691.69s -> 15702.04s]  the fingers guide us all and you tarnished you are here to take our hand is this though
[15704.67s -> 15709.55s]  oh great rooms great children of the goddess queen marika
[15709.55s -> 15717.87s]  queen marika she who is vessel of the elden ring tainted by the strengths of their ruins
[15717.87s -> 15732.20s]  her children ward but none become and so grace was extended to your kind listen the fingers speak
[15733.00s -> 15742.12s]  the grito will has long renounced the demigods tarnished show no mercy
[15743.00s -> 15752.91s]  have their heads take all they have left indeed but remember what are you talking through
[15752.99s -> 15760.70s]  the demigods are each and all the direct offspring marika
[15760.70s -> 15791.23s]  gudrik the glove that's the only thing i can say in like the 10 minutes we've been walking around
[15791.79s -> 15796.78s]  with the power of remembrance menu you can draw out the power of remembrance namesake each
[15796.78s -> 15801.42s]  remember is can provide one power once the power is claimed the remembrance will be lost
[15803.31s -> 15814.20s]  axe of gudrik or whatever that thing is and i see what it looks like okay rafted dragon
[15821.32s -> 15833.64s]  faith scaling what is that it's faith it's not intelligence unfortunately it's the fist
[15834.60s -> 15843.29s]  only i knew that you're doing a faith strength build well i i believe i believe you've just
[15843.29s -> 15852.94s]  seen something that you should be using what if i don't want these can i just break it or
[15852.94s -> 15864.06s]  do i have to use that is it like the other games like can i just smack shit and eat it i can just
[15864.06s -> 15870.36s]  eat it for money right you can turn it into ruins just yeah just like all the other games
[15872.03s -> 15879.29s]  yeah i i can't i can't use either one of those things i use it yeah that's it of course
[15881.08s -> 15887.72s]  20 000 runes are you serious i mean it would have been cool uh that that dragon arm thing
[15887.72s -> 15892.78s]  is probably awesome all right is there anything else you need me to do so this is the boss soul
[15892.78s -> 15910.62s]  person all right fingers are here i'm gonna level up again i hope somebody has a staff do that gesture
[15910.62s -> 15951.61s]  in front of the fingers really what do you do gesture was rapture this is it looking this is
[15951.61s -> 15965.52s]  like what everybody's cat does it's like you look down the cat's just there like pick me up so you
[15965.52s -> 15976.83s]  look down the catches on your leg like i'm coming up here okay that was cool don't hurt that that
[15976.83s -> 16007.80s]  was very strange it's all right up ease up ease rest oh i can rest here i knew i could i'm not
[16007.80s -> 16014.32s]  sure what to do because there's a theory of dumping it into endurance and vitality
[16015.12s -> 16025.36s]  i feel like it's been a while but i feel like i'm falling behind a lot on damage right now
[16026.32s -> 16035.07s]  fighting godric i feel like i was not doing enough damage i i think i need to start i really need to
[16035.07s -> 16044.25s]  find that sorcerer because he had that that weapon and that move maybe some more mana
[16045.05s -> 16053.24s]  all right we're gonna do two and endurance get endurance to 15 and we'll get mined up to 14
[16054.36s -> 16061.77s]  and then i i saved those souls because i need to find that guy because i gotta get some of these
[16061.77s -> 16068.04s]  new abilities because that magic sword is essentially what i'll be using for the most
[16068.04s -> 16077.92s]  of the game i would assume i don't want to hug i know where the sorcerer is but i won't tell you
[16077.92s -> 16103.64s]  that's all right i wonder if he's not here why aren't you upset um i mean do i if you want to
[16103.64s -> 16111.29s]  watch me upset just rewind the vaude by like 15 to 20 minutes and watch me just absolutely call
[16111.29s -> 16116.48s]  out every single thing i don't like about this game it's the hardest game at walmart yeah it is
[16119.58s -> 16124.78s]  we were okay we talked there was a lot of back and forth about what i said during dark souls
[16124.78s -> 16131.02s]  3 i believe i talked about how fucking impossible the game was the game is so hard it's too hard
[16131.98s -> 16137.50s]  and i said it was the hardest game i was like it's the hardest game ever made it's like the hardest
[16137.50s -> 16142.78s]  game you can buy whatever and people are like oh dude what about like boshi and i was like okay
[16142.78s -> 16147.10s]  fine so it's like the heart it we came to the conclusion that it's the hardest fucking game
[16147.10s -> 16154.14s]  at walmart okay it's the hardest game at target okay it's not like some crazy like impossible
[16154.14s -> 16160.24s]  game that was made it's but it's what do you want me to say it was sakiro yeah it was sakiro
[16160.24s -> 16172.81s]  not dark souls 3 it was sakiro and sakiro was fucking brutal this is open now you've received
[16172.81s -> 16182.49s]  the wisdom of the two fingers have you oh this guy will talk to me now you like this more than
[16182.49s -> 16186.22s]  sakiro
[16193.42s -> 16195.24s]  i like okay
[16202.00s -> 16205.20s]  i need to see a few more of the bosses like some of the main story bosses
[16207.12s -> 16214.35s]  because as it stands right now the first two like main story bosses i feel like we're very
[16214.35s -> 16220.11s]  similar i want to see more before i have an opinion of like the bosses in this game
[16220.99s -> 16234.64s]  there's a story yeah okay so what are you after more great ruins then as your fellow allow me to
[16234.64s -> 16243.56s]  dive all your little knowledge the inheritors of the heroes boss fights were crazy and the
[16243.56s -> 16249.96s]  thing about sakiro was like you like the revive feature was very interesting even though the game
[16249.96s -> 16255.74s]  was really difficult and it was really brutal like in fact you come back to life like two
[16255.82s -> 16258.54s]  three times sometimes was really that was really forgiving
[16263.55s -> 16276.67s]  gorilla yeah that's crazy queen of the full moon you'll still be after more great ruins
[16276.67s -> 16281.32s]  but those are all the people that have the great ruins but this is where i need to ask
[16281.32s -> 16287.95s]  where they are i heard about the academy understand you've been speaking to me wait no
[16287.95s -> 16298.64s]  she's my daughter when she lost the guidance of grace youthful curricular purposes so i put her
[16298.64s -> 16305.24s]  to work do not hesitate to employ her despite her looks she is more than capable in the press
[16305.24s -> 16315.93s]  of battle godric the grafted lord of stormvale despite being the blood of godfrey first elven
[16315.93s -> 16322.75s]  lord he's a grotesque old fool his castle lies upon the cliff to limb graves northwest okay
[16322.75s -> 16329.40s]  but i suspect you know that well enough already because he's dead all right where i want to hear
[16329.40s -> 16337.98s]  about the academy because that's where i want to go that's the sorcerer academy general radars he
[16337.98s -> 16346.20s]  fought millennia to a stand house to lim gray hailed wilds lindgrave east has been engulfed by
[16346.20s -> 16352.36s]  the scarlet rot even approaching the region is no mean feat i've heard survivors of radon's army
[16352.36s -> 16360.27s]  are still in the wilds okay east and if it's true i said oh i doubt he much resembles his former
[16360.27s -> 16369.79s]  self then i want to know where are this person is the grace given his lord of laindale it lies
[16369.79s -> 16374.11s]  at the foot of the earth what are their retreat nope east of the altus plateau but the two fingers
[16374.11s -> 16380.11s]  forbid us from venturing there why until we've acquired enough great runes to repair the elven
[16380.11s -> 16386.19s]  ring set your sights elsewhere for the time being so that's like a hard boss where's this person
[16387.15s -> 16397.60s]  no no no not you the academy okay that's where i want to go
[16402.80s -> 16409.58s]  herself is no demigod her beloved to become queen marika's second husband

[16431.60s -> 16441.74s]  sorcery guy he's in a different spot somewhere else be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman

[16539.74s -> 16546.14s]  you can't even swing that many times in a row in this game you can't swing that many times
[16546.14s -> 16551.74s]  in a row you just can't swing that many times in a row we have to all play by the same rules
[16551.74s -> 16602.40s]  and and we don't see you motherfucker let's go what is this fucking double frost bite i'll get
[16604.08s -> 16609.90s]  okay if i kill you do i get that frost move because i will do whatever it takes to get you
[16610.62s -> 16631.76s]  oh my god i forgot that those weren't spent oh my fucking god are you kidding me i thought
[16632.40s -> 16639.60s]  that they i why is that sorcerer not in this fucking building
[16652.32s -> 16656.80s]  i can't fuck it we were like talking about something and i just whatever i'm killing this
[16656.80s -> 16702.48s]  guy come on that sucks i can't believe i did that what's with the bm he actually drank a potion

[16726.27s -> 16743.47s]  we meet again after all i apologize for any offense given by my bearing but able to move
[16743.47s -> 16760.17s]  you see so what do you need you defeated godric and claimed yourself a great rune
[16761.85s -> 16767.77s]  looks like we both got what we wanted out of stormvale didn't we well done friend something
[16767.77s -> 16776.81s]  to mark the occasion go on oh what are you giving me what are you gonna be a plus eight item

[16787.40s -> 16793.84s]  what is that dude why does this have to happen to me you were sitting in the one spot that he's like
[16793.84s -> 16799.92s]  hiding in this place like okay i thought it was just a balcony i don't think there was a guy
[16799.92s -> 16805.68s]  sitting against the wall dressed dressed as the guy in the painting and he's wearing the clothes
[16805.68s -> 16821.10s]  the blades wearing the same color scheme what is that plus eight c scaling oh it's a thrusting

[16895.69s -> 16902.65s]  fucking believe it obviously just like have them stand up like that just have them all stand in a
[16902.65s -> 16908.06s]  line next to each other shoulder to shoulder yeah like why can't they all just be sitting at the
[16908.06s -> 16917.02s]  round table like oh i'm godric i'm uh i'm bodrick i'm codrick you're just oh yes we're here
[16917.02s -> 16925.74s]  strategizing i don't have to go look for him i can't believe he's just sitting over here i thought

[18678.49s -> 18689.00s]  everybody over here it's an area thing i mean that was really funny but i've that almost cost me the
[18689.00s -> 18702.46s]  whole encounter well okay all right let me keep looking over there if you didn't have a range
[18702.46s -> 18706.30s]  you'd be able to terrify the whole map that'd be kind of crazy though if you're just flying around
[18710.24s -> 18712.96s]  something else that i noticed too that i didn't really have to worry about before
[18714.33s -> 18720.01s]  so if the horse is dead you have to confirm that you want to use it on the horse it was kind of
[18720.01s -> 18736.41s]  weird because i just got shot with a gun like that was a bullet i got something new what is it
[18740.19s -> 18759.07s]  aiden armor oh it looks kind of cool same thing uh greaves okay i look cool let's explore the lake

[19169.00s -> 19186.46s]  could jump on from here what can i jump on from here there it is okay we're okay now sorry about
[19186.46s -> 19198.99s]  that just a little problem let's continue to find out the heck is down here although i do
[19199.87s -> 19210.60s]  now that i'm not fighting a boss let's get this situated i am a magician no no we call it
[19210.60s -> 19230.65s]  magician here mage oh you're a mage no you're a magician what the hell is going on down here
[19231.85s -> 19252.80s]  oh these a lot of smithing stones that's what they're getting oh you were way more dangerous
[19252.80s -> 19269.07s]  looking than i thought you're all way more this is awesome this is where i can finally get some
[19269.07s -> 19298.32s]  materials okay another tunnel which way should i go i'm thinking this way
[19320.48s -> 19326.65s]  stone i'm really happy the game actually gave me an upgraded weapon so many people that aren't
[19326.65s -> 19331.37s]  doing this exact stupid thing that i'm doing well it's not that stupid but like the intelligence
[19331.37s -> 19336.25s]  and decks is that's what this weapon is for so a ton of people are getting this and see plus eight
[19336.25s -> 19343.24s]  they do a pog face and they go wait no dude that's not i can't use that and i'm sitting here
[19343.24s -> 19377.39s]  giggling i'm sitting just laughing my ass off does this go down or up because if it goes up
[19378.28s -> 19385.95s]  then there's an opportunity to go down there which i think wait oh this just goes down okay
[19385.95s -> 19427.74s]  wait look for secrets got one where is it what side is it on this side on that side what are
[19427.74s -> 19457.28s]  these statues for this guy has zero object permanence but i'm real fun at parties my
[19457.28s -> 19463.39s]  weapon is bouncing off of these guys these guys made out of this material that's kind of cool
[19467.56s -> 19492.46s]  lintstone scrap oh i thought it was a glintstone key another interesting another tunnel to go
[19492.46s -> 19500.91s]  through another elevator all right i'm actually starting to get confused because this is like
[19500.91s -> 19536.88s]  the third elevator i think i may have missed something oh my god that was just streamer
[19536.88s -> 19543.58s]  syndrome i didn't want to have to go back down because i was going to look over and people are
[19543.58s -> 19547.90s]  going to be like dude this guy's got zero object permanence like this guy sucks like really dude
[19547.90s -> 19550.78s]  you have to do you have to go up and down the elevator three times to know where to go
[19551.34s -> 19558.60s]  and i was like oh shit like people are gonna think i'm stupid so i have to i don't even know
[19558.60s -> 19575.50s]  where that is um where the fuck do i go marika you fool what i wouldn't is marika what is it
[19575.50s -> 19593.72s]  marika is the statue what marika is the statue i don't remember how to get there
[19594.28s -> 19602.35s]  it was like i jumped through here i went down i went down twice i think right it's not wait
[19602.35s -> 19610.32s]  it's not there i went down here and then it's down i jumped in the middle went down again
[19612.16s -> 19639.32s]  no i'm not this is wrong where the hell am i the elevator you just used but i have to jump in the
[19639.32s -> 19652.33s]  middle but hold on i didn't let me see what's down here though i'm not gonna die large glintstone
[19652.33s -> 19672.22s]  scrap what is this for oh wait there could be a hole right here you know what i'm saying
[19676.92s -> 19683.55s]  somebody's gonna attack me right they would have done something like that okay so that was worth
[19683.55s -> 19694.28s]  coming down here a few things did you kill the horse guy yeah you can charge up the greatsword
[19694.28s -> 19715.98s]  can i okay i'm a little more interested in this weapon now the only problem is good luck doing
[19715.98s -> 19723.21s]  that at any boss encounter in any game ever all right zero object permanence uh i believe
[19723.21s -> 19764.83s]  it's on this side i want to see the range critical miss i just want to see what the
[19764.83s -> 19785.66s]  item does okay finally finally finally finally let me get this let me jump over here
[19786.38s -> 19800.60s]  it's this ledge right there i'm ready here we go zero awareness this is not the right ledge it's
[19800.60s -> 19823.61s]  that it's that one okay it's that one great am i dead if i jump off this golden rune and then
[19823.61s -> 19851.61s]  the whatever that is i want it somber smithing stone excellent okay well are we ready uh if you're
[19851.69s -> 19856.11s]  if you're low on smithing stones i recommend going to this stage of the map right here
[19856.75s -> 19862.19s]  right here the limb grave tunnels there's plenty of materials for you to gather to be able to
[19862.19s -> 19883.36s]  upgrade at least two or three times there's a guy in there this guy's fucked are you ready for this
[19884.32s -> 19890.57s]  i'm gonna aggro this guy and then i'm gonna run back here and go up the elevator and he's gonna
[19890.57s -> 19939.16s]  drop down and die i'm getting ready preparing to escape oh i can't fuck i can't i can't boys
[19939.80s -> 19969.37s]  i have no mana left what an idiot what a fucking idiotic thing to do what is that
[19977.71s -> 19988.36s]  it's so hard to tell what he's doing one more time okay easy game is not even a hard game
[19990.01s -> 20005.82s]  rare medallion raw medallion that was cool what a cool little dungeon
[20008.81s -> 20017.52s]  anyone that's smithing stones i'm just i really am i need to like settle down i'm burnt okay i'm
[20017.52s -> 20026.24s]  burning like 30 extra energy by like being loud and weird i need to like i gotta settle down
[20026.88s -> 20037.39s]  i'm being too like loud i'm burning extra energy okay there's nothing else here is that a
[20044.72s -> 20065.37s]  is that a i a war thing one of those war things not what is it roars and breath attacks
[20066.01s -> 20087.18s]  oh man man i feel like i'm burning calories is watching you but you are it's like for an hour
[20087.18s -> 20093.96s]  but you are that was really cool all right i love the little random dungeons man that's the best
[20093.96s -> 20100.28s]  part of the whole game i know the bosses in these souls games from software games are the best part
[20100.28s -> 20105.98s]  everyone's like oh i love the bosses uh-uh not on this one i think the main story bosses are like
[20106.86s -> 20110.86s]  all the way down to the bottom versus like exploring the open world and finding a cool
[20110.86s -> 20124.04s]  little dungeon that is way way cooler to me now bought that the huge main story campaign bosses
[20124.04s -> 20129.50s]  so far i've been all right they've been cool but that's having little dungeons like that
[20130.22s -> 20133.50s]  that take like 30 40 minutes and there's like a little mini boss at the end
[20134.30s -> 20146.56s]  i find that way more interesting to me right now like going and exploring the
[20146.56s -> 20158.01s]  the like go okay first coming to the lake right there's like oh shit i'm at the lake
[20159.42s -> 20165.61s]  oh here's a good here's a guy here right it's cool there's a dungeon go find the thing at the end
[20166.41s -> 20180.49s]  there's a few more places i want to see but i really probably should get out of here
[20181.61s -> 20194.89s]  and go explore something else collect these don't wait our flies or those bats the bats
[20207.12s -> 20222.62s]  ruin you probably like breath of the wild and probably so we did this wait dragon burnt
[20222.62s -> 20226.22s]  ruins no he didn't i did this what's the wait that's where the dragon came from
[20227.02s -> 20263.88s]  hold on a sec new area a little dungeon or something dragon burnt ruins bye nobody move

[21542.65s -> 21545.69s]  i think i'm actually gonna put this on because this thing kind of sucks
[21548.49s -> 21550.25s]  and i can at least move around with that on
[21550.97s -> 21565.69s]  and scarcely swing a blade but she has a gift spirit tuning i saw another one like a

[21658.99s -> 21665.47s]  is it i'll ask master hugue to teach me certainly he does appear intimidating and holds no love for
[21665.47s -> 21670.99s]  us too i know he's trapped here at the round table hole just like jerma he's trapped here he can't
[21670.99s -> 21680.48s]  leave so if i do have a talent for spirit tuning and goodness knows that would i suppose i should

[23739.85s -> 23745.21s]  and like hurt them i could have just climbed up without even a single problem what was i
[23745.21s -> 23753.95s]  doing i need to know what's up there there's probably something up there like a chest or
[23753.95s -> 23776.27s]  something put your shield down howard put your shield down put your shields down
[23778.94s -> 23819.07s]  put your shields down stop moving just stand still i freaked out because i thought my health

[23824.60s -> 23855.53s]  health bar zero i kind of freaked out both of you just cheeses the whole game what are you talking
[23855.53s -> 23863.58s]  about the last like the last like three or four bosses i've bought without sorcery i'm a battle
[23863.58s -> 23868.70s]  major you just don't want to you don't want me to use sorcery like i have 22 points in intelligence

[23925.37s -> 23942.44s]  comes ready all right nice hey you guys they call freddy fencing because of your elden ring fencing
[23942.44s -> 23959.66s]  gameplay um i've been called a few different things yeah all right so what was the point
[23959.66s -> 23969.98s]  is another ladder it's actually another ladder right there come on something good something
[23969.98s -> 23977.18s]  worth coming up here for arrows sting talisman that seems probably like extra damage on range
[23977.18s -> 24000.08s]  but let's see what's up here uh is it what is it yeah okay whiz raises attack power of sorcery
[24000.08s -> 24016.20s]  spells still cool coming up here all right it's time to go back to limb grave it's time to take
[24016.20s -> 24028.88s]  a break and i'm gonna i want to go this way i think either here or here this is like the spawn
[24030.38s -> 24036.78s]  and i need to wait a minute hold on wait wait wait is it time to i actually go back and do
[24036.78s -> 24060.75s]  this how many um it's two stones to go in the one at spawn right so if it's two stones to go back to
[24060.75s -> 24072.57s]  the it's four thousand to buy one i have one i could go like here and go like down this way
[24072.57s -> 24080.92s]  essentially right let me try that first though let me let me farm just i will take a break after
[24080.92s -> 24087.58s]  this i'm gonna farm a fight here get enough to buy one go open the one at spawn see what's in there
[24088.46s -> 24111.47s]  i just need i need four thousand good luck everybody don't be a dickhead really you know
[24111.47s -> 24125.44s]  i'll just fight okay i need four thousand come on go for it weirdly enough they're not the dogs
[24125.44s -> 24145.08s]  are not doing that much damage to these guys like at all kind of getting destroyed harry i'm just
[24145.08s -> 24151.26s]  waiting for one of you to die i don't care who this is gonna be worth like a thousand you gotta
[24151.26s -> 24175.04s]  get the boys out all right sure why not let's get the boys out here and then we come in and
[24175.04s -> 24191.37s]  we claim victory that's such bullshit like i'm such a piece of shit for what i'm doing right now
[24196.94s -> 24202.22s]  hey don't blame me blame the game that lets me get uh experience points when i don't do anything
[24202.94s -> 24247.72s]  work smarter not harder i got way too complacent okay 3d 30 35 000 out of mana we're almost there
[24247.72s -> 24263.12s]  one all right let me just switch to this get a couple of stabs in i am on no one's team
[24263.84s -> 24286.83s]  such a dude i'm such a dick i have like all the cheat codes i'm not supposed to be here
[24293.64s -> 24302.84s]  so bad okay let's go i've got enough souls i can buy it we're gonna see some cool content here you
[24302.84s -> 24315.60s]  ready anybody drop anything who sells this shit something this guy does right somebody does
[24316.32s -> 24331.47s]  who sells them you do right you're the person in team fortress too when everybody on both teams
[24331.47s -> 24336.59s]  is trying to chill and hang out and you the one guy that come in and ruin everything yeah i just
[24336.59s -> 24345.15s]  like i just boom boom drop an entire magazine or entire clip of stickies in the room and then sit
[24345.15s -> 24356.64s]  there and go and just watch the kill feed have like five names on it fucking dick who's this
[24370.52s -> 24381.47s]  should be left well should you spy a mariner unless you wish to lay down your life in vain
[24381.47s -> 24389.71s]  those who live in death should be left or more should you buy a mariner whatever that means
[24391.64s -> 24398.44s]  okay i'm gonna buy one of those things and then we are gonna go from there to
[24400.46s -> 24406.06s]  the spawn of the game i'm gonna put both keys in and we're gonna see what happens
[24407.16s -> 24426.17s]  actually pretty excited this actually seems pretty cool very excited let's do it uh it's
[24426.17s -> 24435.13s]  like right here right first step right is it two it's three no it's not it's it i thought it was
[24435.13s -> 24450.24s]  two it's actually three it's three yeah people no no i'll get down here we'll i'll get down
[24450.24s -> 24482.28s]  here and we'll figure it out where is it bro i gotta go pee i know i know man i know one moment
[24482.28s -> 24498.35s]  i'm gonna get the bonfire there it is okay i'm gonna open it rest here open it see what the
[24498.35s -> 24503.96s]  hell is down here actually no this will be when we come back because i want this thing to be a
[24503.96s -> 24512.78s]  big reveal all right let's go pee i'll be right back um how long have i been streaming for because
[24512.78s -> 24518.49s]  i'm streaming tomorrow too how long has it been six hours all right we're gonna go for like another
[24518.49s -> 24526.52s]  hour or two and then i'll be live again tomorrow with more elden ring make sure you loop the music
[24526.52s -> 24739.40s]  i will play uh we'll play a different one when you guys are recognized right back don't be time
[24739.40s -> 24747.44s]  to see what's over here great beginning of the game very excited i feel really bad if there's
[24748.88s -> 24753.36s]  frostbolt bolts down here i'm gonna be incredibly upset about it
[24760.01s -> 24770.97s]  okay very cool that song is absolutely but what's the word i'm looking for dope
[24771.69s -> 24789.29s]  seriously that song is dope okay let's do it use the keys
[24792.16s -> 24826.84s]  what we got that poisonous it is poison oh shit it's poison
[24840.16s -> 24856.48s]  oh scope looks like we are a little bit of a poison shaggy is just morty for freaking morty
[24856.48s -> 24871.90s]  what was that you see that that was just like a car driving god um did i miss anything back here
[24871.90s -> 24880.48s]  this poison is going to stay on the whole time but what can i do i'm not saying character wise
[24880.48s -> 24888.17s]  they're the same i'm saying that vocally they are pretty similar now what can i slide down here
[24888.17s -> 24909.56s]  when does it stop what the fuck turned and bumped into me and they killed me okay piece of shit
[24919.23s -> 24923.47s]  so there's probably a rhyme or reason for me to be able to actually just go like this and run really
[24923.47s -> 24927.71s]  fast and not have the poison build up fast enough maybe jumping will slow it down it does not
[24927.71s -> 24937.85s]  just run before it fills up all the way and i should be okay and i am okay what do i do about
[24937.85s -> 24946.64s]  this i think you just follow it down what exactly what i'm gonna do i thought there was gonna be a
[24946.64s -> 24960.44s]  slide i thought i was gonna just like start sliding down anything over here there's a way down all
[24960.44s -> 24965.29s]  the way they guys have to keep going well there's gonna be an item in one of these what a bad time
[24965.29s -> 24979.53s]  to leave i gotta check every one of these holes because you know there's gonna be an item in one
[24979.53s -> 25002.52s]  of them it has to be hello okay hello why was that guy so magical i don't have enough
[25002.52s -> 25045.44s]  am i safe here or it's not i thought there was going to be a second one on the other side going
[25045.44s -> 25063.68s]  up and down i didn't think that one changed tracks oh well
[25079.66s -> 25093.82s]  ah you gotta love those dungeons right you gotta love those dungeons i will eventually okay i just
[25093.82s -> 25104.57s]  have to be patient just be patient and stop doing that stuff i know there's no items on any of the
[25104.57s -> 25132.43s]  ledges or anything so i can just run through there's a guy in this one no there's a bow and arrow
[25133.07s -> 25150.09s]  yep this guy here guy comes over here yep i think i remember that okay so now
[25151.05s -> 25158.57s]  i just gotta keep going just run turn the corner run go this thing does not stop i need to find
[25158.57s -> 25176.59s]  another little uh place to go right here let me get a good look first i'm not just running down
[25176.59s -> 25187.48s]  there how far does it go does it go all the way around no it stays here that doesn't seem like
[25187.48s -> 25204.04s]  very far is there another safe zone what the fuck are you what i'm trying to spell the sprint button
[25204.92s -> 25230.14s]  what the guy just fucking killed himself he just fucking jumped onto the tracks
[25268.96s -> 25277.20s]  i thought it hit me what did it was a foul ball what was that weird foul ball was it did it bump
[25277.20s -> 25329.28s]  into my sword and i think my sword hit me in the head oh man is so there's more dude okay uh
[25330.00s -> 25347.04s]  where's the next place to go i don't see another place to go it's right there
[25348.43s -> 25352.59s]  do i follow it down i think i have to follow this down because i'm not gonna have enough time to
[25352.59s -> 25360.19s]  run down that whole way i gotta follow it down run run run run run run run run run run run run
[25360.19s -> 25403.10s]  run i gotta follow it down pretending is exhausting okay but i had the right idea
[25403.10s -> 25418.11s]  just i didn't i caught the lip you piece of shit i probably could run all the way to the second
[25418.11s -> 25456.49s]  thing i can just facing in and out of reality horseshit all right turn just go down i know
[25456.49s -> 25479.26s]  where to go from here and then just follow it down wham hurry up hurry up just keep going
[25479.82s -> 25522.83s]  you had it keep going am i gonna die here the fucking camera sucks okay so you have to go
[25523.71s -> 25532.22s]  you gotta just keep going okay so when you turn you just have to run all the way to the bottom
[25532.22s -> 25546.04s]  i get it okay this is the one i'm gonna get to the bottom just keep going after that corner yeah i'm
[25546.04s -> 25550.44s]  just literally just gonna run just run run run run run after that corner just keep going all the
[25550.44s -> 25555.71s]  way down run past the bridge and i'll be out of there it's the last one i promise i'm gonna get
[25555.71s -> 25588.48s]  it here this is it this is the one this is the last one no don't push me into it don't push me
[25588.48s -> 25601.85s]  into it all right this is the one here we go this is it ready when it goes up okay when it goes up
[25601.85s -> 25612.80s]  i'm running for my life all the way don't stop don't stop don't stop don't stop go go go go go
[25612.80s -> 25628.32s]  go go go go go go go go go go go no stopping run run run run run run run run go go go go
[25628.96s -> 25635.82s]  safe zone safe zone no keep going keep going keep going it's not here yet
[25641.87s -> 25664.44s]  uh um what where am i where do i go hey where is it where is it oh shit it's still following me
[25664.44s -> 25700.81s]  should i go i don't know what to do oh it's hard to tell it goes all the way down there's a little
[25700.81s -> 25706.67s]  thing on the right i think i can just sneak into the thing on the right and let's see that little
[25706.67s -> 25742.81s]  like uh nudge sticking out i think i just would go down there i think so is there a bonfire down
[25742.81s -> 25756.70s]  here this is a boss down here are you kidding me there's no bonfire or anything i can respawn
[25756.70s -> 25823.71s]  here let's go who's down here what the fuck holy shit holy shit this thing's crazy all right
[25823.71s -> 25841.12s]  so let me see put the headphones in let me see if he does he has like these like i'm thinking stay
[25841.12s -> 25850.92s]  in his back stay in his hind legs he's just so big he takes up the whole room yeah it's definitely
[25850.92s -> 25894.08s]  right it's definitely his back damn so i don't know this is such a tiny little area you still
[25894.08s -> 25899.88s]  have the shitty default shield from the tutorial i don't know i don't i don't what can i block
[25900.76s -> 25921.90s]  maybe this is a block fight i think you honestly i think you just stay right behind him stay right
[25921.90s -> 25938.49s]  at his ass i'm thinking try to stay behind him his tail kind of swings around not look that
[25938.49s -> 25945.84s]  effective i had the right idea i think is just try to stay and i'm i'm not doing there's no time
[25945.84s -> 25951.20s]  for spells here this really sucks because i cannot change the allocation i have to beat him with four
[25951.20s -> 25958.01s]  blasts boys don't work down here i can't even summon the boys even if i wanted to what am i
[25958.01s -> 26013.66s]  talking about here they come jesus dude this guy is just a fucking slob he's one of those bosses
[26013.66s -> 26023.18s]  that you don't know what he's attacking when he's just moving his body it's the fucking tail the
[26023.18s -> 26040.96s]  tail is sensitive you know what i mean like which one of those is attacked and which one is this guy
[26040.96s -> 26069.64s]  just moving around the room i think it's the tail someone's rotten stray spirit let's try that
[26070.28s -> 26079.56s]  here is rotten spirit versus rotten spirit might be about the flask it yeah well let's let's see i
[26079.56s -> 26111.21s]  mean this guy's insane so there's no distance really let me see maybe the belly this guy's
[26111.29s -> 26159.31s]  fucking ridiculous it's not the face dude what come on i mean how do you even how do you even
[26159.87s -> 26169.47s]  decide when he's gonna attack how are you supposed to even know he this this this dude is just
[26170.11s -> 26187.08s]  crazy are the flaws they're so under leveled though and what about maybe distance maybe this
[26187.08s -> 26199.80s]  is better i can at least see what he's doing right i think that's the play i really do
[26200.52s -> 26224.80s]  i think this uh boss is uh like 10 bosses try sorcery i don't think i'm ready for this dude
[26224.80s -> 26233.56s]  he's crazy let's let me try sorcery and just like run away can i two hand the staff can i two hand
[26233.56s -> 26242.16s]  the staff and that's how you charge i wonder if i can do something weird here hold on let me two
[26242.16s -> 26266.14s]  hand stuff and i actually doesn't work doesn't seem particularly weak to it either well now i
[26266.14s -> 26283.31s]  don't have a weapon i will block your attacks best bet but spam heavy attacks with the uh with the
[26283.31s -> 26304.16s]  rip here are you you're just punching the dude that's worth it i think it's worth it let's try
[26304.16s -> 26323.90s]  it i'm there's no way i beat this boss what about fire i don't even know if it hurts him i mean it
[26323.90s -> 26354.32s]  does oh there's no way i'm supposed to be here hey you want to fight the boss all right here you
[26354.32s -> 26361.93s]  go let's you want to fight this game this this game's boss this sounds fun all right here's your
[26361.93s -> 26401.53s]  screen it's time for you to fight the boss good one uh this ain't happening it's not happening i
[26401.53s -> 26411.90s]  know i know where they are though i know i know i know what's on spirit what happened to my sound

[26701.44s -> 26721.90s]  because i'm gonna do it especially with this uh with this build all in health potions i could
[26721.90s -> 26725.42s]  go get health potions only and then but i have to make the whole trek back down here
[26726.14s -> 26808.56s]  i ain't coming back down to this piece of shit he's dead now fuck that up sorry no fuck all right
[26808.56s -> 26855.24s]  when does he do this like 50 i got an unbind crouch worst fucking thing in the whole game
[26855.24s -> 26868.78s]  seriously like honest to god that's such a bad place for that like that happened to like unbind
[26868.78s -> 26877.85s]  left stick and rebind it like stop squeezing the controller do you see the game this is not
[26877.85s -> 26888.03s]  like mario party this is not mario party 2 the what how are you not supposed to what i'm not
[26888.03s -> 26898.86s]  sitting here like oh wow watch out watch out for the mushroom i'm gripping this thing like
[26898.86s -> 26908.91s]  it's fucking about to strangle me i'll get this i'm fucking beating this boss you bet your ass i am
[26912.22s -> 26926.83s]  i don't need full estus i don't need it i think i broke my audio cable audio is only coming out
[26926.83s -> 26935.53s]  of one ear it's weird okay i got it i got this motherfucker right now i forgot to unbind it
[26936.09s -> 26962.84s]  just kill me you know okay you know how they make it not awful is if you have to hold it for like a
[26962.84s -> 26970.11s]  full second like if it was like hold left stick for like one crouch it's like who's crouching in
[26970.11s -> 26980.11s]  any of these fights i'm gonna give the fucking boys a call on this one you better believe it
[26980.11s -> 26997.23s]  you better believe that i'm giving them a ring a ding ding not be fuck what i just do
[27002.78s -> 27013.20s]  fuck settle down stop swearing all right let's go boys bring him up it takes too long to cast it
[27013.20s -> 27027.96s]  it's not worth it it takes way too long to cast it's just guaranteed to get hit
[27043.26s -> 27048.54s]  yeah it's a waste of time you have to literally go like this ding he's literally got you in his
[27048.54s -> 27061.71s]  mouth already do it on the second phase it's not a bad time to do it but like if i just focus and
[27061.71s -> 27107.56s]  just fucking go hit him in his gut all right quiet quiet i knew he was gonna do it fuck you i
[27107.56s -> 27124.65s]  wasn't even there fuck that you don't have any time to fucking do that at all you get there's
[27124.65s -> 27149.21s]  no time to run at least i know what time he does it don't do it again man oh it's so slow
[27154.65s -> 27161.76s]  wait he blows up more than once i thought that was just like a i'm going to phase two now
[27163.40s -> 27168.76s]  walking on sucks because like it locks onto one central point and you might you can't get close
[27168.76s -> 27204.80s]  enough sometimes between each phase doesn't he only have two and settle down too you know
[27204.80s -> 27211.87s]  what's really killing me is the stamina i just don't have enough just like if i had like 10
[27211.87s -> 27225.02s]  plus more points in stamina maybe this would be like much much easier to do we see your heart rate
[27225.02s -> 27255.66s]  um start like 280 i don't like walking on i got him pretty close a few times ago but i
[27256.38s -> 27283.18s]  i'm just i'm just not supposed to be here and what's five out of ten decide to do you
[27283.18s -> 27319.23s]  burn all your cooldowns all right here comes phase one phase one incoming phase one outgoing
[27319.23s -> 27337.21s]  phase one outgoing not yet when phase one outgoing where is it he should have done it by now
[27337.77s -> 27385.32s]  why isn't he doing it what the fuck's happening fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you he does it twice
[27399.42s -> 27429.96s]  yes god damn it if i just had a little bit more attack power just a little bit more
[27430.84s -> 27439.72s]  the fucking flasks are killing me i got this i really do i've got this it's the four fucking
[27439.72s -> 27446.65s]  flasks i'm about to go back and just put the two in and just run back down here like i have this
[27446.65s -> 27496.32s]  stupid goddamn mage shit class i have four heels oh my god it's so frustrating
[27496.96s -> 27505.20s]  i wish there was a fucking bonfire down here just give me my two other flask and this guy is
[27505.20s -> 27514.32s]  dead all right three more attempts if i can't beat them then i'm gonna go bonfire get two more
[27514.32s -> 27520.72s]  flasks no this one doesn't count this this this piece of shit i'm literally talking and he has the
[27520.72s -> 27542.81s]  balls to fucking attack me while i'm talking how come you guys are counting to 10 why because you
[27542.81s -> 27605.44s]  know what even upgrading the 2020 hindsight man is he gonna do it dude and i was ready for it too
[27624.56s -> 27655.90s]  what i didn't dodge through him i'm fucked i'm fucked here tail swipe sucks
[27658.51s -> 27664.91s]  that tail swipe is like holy shit man he likes spins but you think he's gonna go up but he
[27664.91s -> 27672.70s]  just doesn't and he'll just swipe you with the tail all right this is the last try before i get
[27672.70s -> 27678.11s]  more heels and i'm i what i was gonna say is 2020 hindsight claws were the thing to upgrade
[27678.75s -> 27705.96s]  unfortunately even if you try to dodge through it like sometimes this one's okay this one doesn't
[27705.96s -> 27713.66s]  count like i i have to try to beat him now because there's no way i'm gonna come back here later and
[27713.66s -> 27778.59s]  like remember all this bullshit this idiot does it's just it's just like just way too hard for the
[27778.59s -> 27781.79s]  level a and it sucks because i don't want to come all the fucking way back down here
[27796.83s -> 27983.42s]  were you here were you in the room were you in the fucking room
[27992.51s -> 28023.16s]  oh it feels good to beat that motherfucker coming in dance roof 2020 hindsight these gloves i should
[28023.16s -> 28036.22s]  have i should have upgraded them oh oh my god it feels good so what was that is that a new
[28036.22s -> 28045.47s]  thing summoned spirit of the banished knight oleg oh dude we've got a new best friend here
[28045.47s -> 28054.36s]  we've got a new bro here really what does it do holy shit i have like a dual welding
[28057.50s -> 28071.04s]  oh man is he gonna be sick he's a hundred fp i'll be honest i thought i was dead i thought i
[28071.04s -> 28076.72s]  he did that did you see that bullshit he did the exploding thing that wasn't a phase change that's
[28076.72s -> 28082.33s]  just a thing that he can do that bastard just does that move normally i don't think that's
[28082.33s -> 28096.94s]  a phase change he did it like three more times you've got your gamer license renewed you missed
[28096.94s -> 28100.78s]  the last tail thing you didn't dodge it i think i was too close to his stomach so the tail just
[28100.78s -> 28113.23s]  didn't i just got lucky at the end all right i'm probably gonna have to say that's probably where
[28113.23s -> 28117.63s]  i'm gonna call it for today because i need to go eat food and go take like a cold shower because
[28117.63s -> 28130.59s]  that was seriously like it was i i'm like a lightning bolt right now oh i you know what i
[28130.59s -> 28135.18s]  have to stop doing i have to stop doing like emperor palpatine you guys know what i'm saying
[28136.33s -> 28141.21s]  like yeah should i have probably been here no but like every three or four deaths like i can't
[28141.21s -> 28145.77s]  i can't do it no i'm too weak i'm too weak no i'm too weak i can't do it no i just i can't
[28146.41s -> 28157.44s]  i can i just did get the item is there i'm gonna make sure i don't want to miss anything here
[28157.44s -> 28183.79s]  is there actually an item that i missed yeah i already got the item i got the item up the slope
[28183.79s -> 28197.32s]  didn't i okay let me upgrade that i'm so glad that i didn't give up damn okay let's do health
[28198.12s -> 28210.43s]  no x there were two ways oh wait maybe the maybe it's just off the boss is dead let me just see if
[28210.43s -> 28223.20s]  it's like turned off there's there was another way to go hold on let me go check that out it's
[28223.20s -> 28241.31s]  definitely worth going up never go back down here ever again just that last moment when i
[28242.03s -> 28250.81s]  hold on this was stupid the last moment when i okay i i'm trying to do like a motivational speech
[28250.81s -> 28265.36s]  okay and again again no sorcery i want all the doubters to remember that uh you said that i was
[28265.36s -> 28271.58s]  a casual sorcerer and i only do sorcery and i'm a loser well what what do you think about that

[28667.90s -> 28675.92s]  a long ass time it didn't come up it took like that was like a minute or two it didn't come up
[28676.72s -> 28684.30s]  that actually is such a shitty place to die though because like i freaked out and almost
[28684.30s -> 28692.06s]  i just i gotta get what on earth am i doing i think i don't think i can use this
[28693.18s -> 28702.59s]  honest to god i don't think i can because those two people i gotta have you are pissing me off and

[28875.71s -> 28893.00s]  i want the thing to come up here because i'm gonna get him killed by it three five six seven eight
[28893.72s -> 28903.80s]  nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
[28907.21s -> 28938.92s]  follow me follow me shit i didn't count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[28939.56s -> 28950.32s]  eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen how did you come in
[28950.32s -> 28990.72s]  here with me two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
[28990.72s -> 29003.90s]  sixteen so that's what you get for fucking teleporting around you dick i'll take the dragon
[29003.90s -> 29018.97s]  command to seal give me the fuck out of here what an asshole all right give me up nothing else here
[29018.97s -> 29048.59s]  right why did he do that okay i will i'll see you guys tomorrow that's it uh that was pretty
[29048.59s -> 29057.34s]  intense day of gaming i was very upset i was very happy excited i was annoyed i was awestruck it was
[29057.34s -> 29062.94s]  everything that was awesome it was fun i really wish i knew what this guy was because i've wasted
[29062.94s -> 29110.09s]  like 15 000 souls being an idiot how do i rate the game so far uh 9.4 oh summon oleg let's see
[29110.09s -> 29116.91s]  what he looks like yeah uh i'm gonna have to reduce points i would okay when i first opened up
[29117.47s -> 29120.75s]  okay after the first like four or five hours of the game i would say it was probably like holy
[29120.75s -> 29130.03s]  shit this is a 9.8 i point seven uh i need to see some of the most the story bosses
[29130.67s -> 29135.26s]  because the first two story bosses really kind of looked kind of like the same guy
[29135.26s -> 29140.54s]  and they had similar really similar moves um all the other side boss stuff has been incredible
[29140.54s -> 29149.24s]  but i want to see some more of the main story bosses um because they kind of the first two were
[29149.24s -> 29156.52s]  very very similar uh but this game apparently has a shitload of bosses in a ton of places to go and
[29156.52s -> 29166.16s]  see i mean i i mean it's i think it's phenomenal i think it's absolutely phenomenal game i think
[29166.16s -> 29175.28s]  it's really good uh i also some of the controls are a little weird if i'm honest and the more that
[29175.28s -> 29183.34s]  like i get frustrated by controls the more the more that i might you know like the left stick
[29183.34s -> 29187.10s]  thing has really kind of been annoying if i'm completely blunt it really i mean i know it's
[29187.10s -> 29192.62s]  like well just don't press it as hard but i mean it's still like it kind of happens all the time
[29193.42s -> 29199.10s]  uh just by simply moving too far to the left or right of your controller and sometimes just
[29199.10s -> 29206.11s]  have it hit if you guys pick up a like an xbox controller or a ps4 ps5 controller hold it hold
[29206.11s -> 29211.07s]  in your hands and like move all the way to the right and if you're like trying to move and dodge
[29211.07s -> 29216.35s]  it's way easier to push the stick in when you're all the way to the right or all the way to the
[29216.35s -> 29221.84s]  left on the stick you know what i mean like i'm talking like this like you hold the button like
[29221.84s -> 29227.68s]  this and you click like accidentally you don't really want to like just standing still like
[29227.68s -> 29232.40s]  yeah you don't like click it it's the pushing and like running and oops i clicked it happens a lot
[29235.66s -> 29242.00s]  but to be fair i don't know where else it could even go i really don't i don't know what that
[29242.00s -> 29247.31s]  would how else you map this if it's not on like a keyboard because they put a bunch of other stuff
[29247.31s -> 29257.26s]  in the game to have to use right so i don't know like how you make that better it's an xbox one
[29257.26s -> 29268.22s]  controller i wonder if maybe the xbox controller might be is it a little bit easier to accidentally
[29268.22s -> 29273.00s]  push it in if you put if you're pulling too hard i'm trying to think of how hard you have to push
[29273.00s -> 29284.62s]  in to actually with the ps5 controller addles would help yeah yeah that's actually a good point
[29285.26s -> 29291.26s]  all right oh like yeah before everybody leaves right i'll see you guys tomorrow though we're
[29291.26s -> 29296.88s]  gonna start uh we're gonna start at four tomorrow it's a 4 p.m pacific we're gonna continue elden
[29296.88s -> 29302.04s]  ring and then i probably i don't know if i'm gonna do four days in a row
[29303.72s -> 29307.72s]  because these streams have been really like beefy but we'll do we'll be tomorrow
[29308.36s -> 29314.46s]  i'll be live tomorrow pretty much all day and all night again and let's uh go attack something so
[29314.46s -> 29320.88s]  you can see oleg but to answer your question in a very long-winded uh way yes i think the
[29320.88s -> 29328.19s]  game is absolutely fucking phenomenal it's really really difficult though and that's a good thing
[29328.19s -> 29332.91s]  and it's a bad thing right like it's an amazing thing to like accomplish something but in the
[29332.91s -> 29341.61s]  moment sometimes it's just like it's i can't do it like palpatine right and it's still so much
[29341.61s -> 29348.70s]  more to see and so much more hard shit to do but the very final opinion you can really have
[29349.58s -> 29360.43s]  is like okay the game's too hard but eventually it isn't like eventually it isn't like once you
[29360.43s -> 29364.43s]  actually figure out what you're doing and you like study bosses and you stop making the same
[29364.43s -> 29370.70s]  mistakes you keep making and i still make them all the time um it's actually awesome how hard it is
[29371.87s -> 29377.13s]  but sometimes you kind of look at it and go like man did i really it took me like four hours to
[29377.13s -> 29382.57s]  beat that guy um something it's just like holy shit i feel i feel like i'm an incredibly
[29382.57s -> 29389.87s]  accomplished person um so it's great as much as you can feel sometimes like it's too much
[29389.87s -> 29399.98s]  i can't do it it's too fucking hard eventually it's not all souls games ever yes there you go
[29399.98s -> 29416.27s]  this is my take i need more fp i can't even cast this really how much fp do i have dude i need way
[29416.27s -> 29431.66s]  i need a i need to level up my mind i can't even cast it okay what's your take on frozen pizzas
[29432.22s -> 29439.10s]  well frozen pizzas are way way too hard um until they're not when you put it in the oven and you
[29439.10s -> 29444.78s]  spend some time uh seeing it and watching it cook and letting it do its thing for like 15 20
[29444.78s -> 29449.82s]  minutes and you understand that you need to cook it first um it comes out and it's very edible and
[29449.82s -> 29460.73s]  it's delicious i would say the same exact thing okay goodbye i'll see you guys tomorrow goodbye
[29460.73s -> 29490.19s]  i'll see you tomorrow take care of yourselves see you soon good night goodbye take care actually
