[0.06s -> 35.30s]  I want you guys to tell me if you can hear the music that is about to start playing.
[35.30s -> 40.01s]  So let me know, because otherwise there will be no sound. So, ready? Let me know if you
[40.01s -> 53.91s]  can hear the medic music. Oh yeah. You hear that? Good to know, because that means I set
[53.91s -> 64.88s]  the audio cable thing up correctly. So that's good to know. Loud and clear, Berga Boy. Alright.
[64.88s -> 71.76s]  So tonight, first of all, happy Saturday. Hope you guys are having a fantastic Saturday.
[71.76s -> 74.84s]  Second of all, of course, Grandpa is tonight. There's a lot of things going on tonight.
[74.84s -> 80.78s]  There's a lot of things going on in the world of Jeremy. Did a video, doing a live stream.
[80.78s -> 88.00s]  Grandpa's is tonight on Machinima. A lot of crazy stuff. So I've been all over the place
[88.00s -> 103.54s]  today. Flomi, let him explain himself. Let him explain himself. Alright, Flomi, you have
[103.54s -> 117.73s]  ten words to explain yourself. Ten words. And ten words or less. Two plus two is four.
[129.50s -> 139.61s]  Alright, so let me just... Where's my phone? Oh, I always am losing my damn phone. It always
[139.61s -> 157.14s]  happens. Hold on. I think it's across the room. There it is. Hello, phone. Alright. Oh, if
[157.14s -> 161.22s]  you're watching this on YouTube, like eventually when I upload this tomorrow, if you're watching
[161.22s -> 164.38s]  this on YouTube, go ahead and you can skip like two or three minutes while I set this
[164.38s -> 169.51s]  up. I know I put an annotation there, but sometimes people go, whoa, when do you start?
[169.51s -> 177.55s]  So go ahead and skip a couple minutes if you're watching this on the YouTubes. Okay. Twitter.
[177.67s -> 185.38s]  Hello, Twitter. So yeah, Team Fortress 2 and Binding of Isaac. And you're probably wondering
[185.38s -> 190.70s]  why am I playing that crazy, ridiculous, disturbing game. Well, because there's DLC for it coming
[190.70s -> 196.28s]  out in like a couple days. So I want to get back into it because I love that game. So
[196.28s -> 217.92s]  let's see. Streaming TF2 and Binding of Isaac. Oh, come hang on ya. HTTP colon slash slash
[217.92s -> 231.69s]  www.twitch.tv. Don't ask me why I always do this on my phone. I just like don't feel
[237.33s -> 244.87s]  like opening up another tab. Like it's probably faster if I did it on my damn computer. It
[244.87s -> 250.10s]  is that. It's that. Alright. Ready to go here in a second. Just going to put a Steam message
[250.10s -> 257.04s]  out to the Steam community. Have to be, oh my, oh what, new name apparently. Massive
[257.04s -> 264.54s]  Bus Accident is my name on here. Well, that's one way to have your name be. Whatever. Massive
[267.44s -> 283.98s]  Bus Accident. Oh, weird. Streaming TF2. Oh, why do I think that's so funny? Oh, screaming
[295.44s -> 317.74s]  now. Colon slash slash. Streaming. Actually, I should put this here. Oh, man. TF2 and Binding
[318.06s -> 335.47s]  of Isaac. Streaming. Yeah, open mouth, faceless party. 15 minutes. Alright. Oh, God. Oh, no.
[338.50s -> 347.50s]  Oh, no. I just like dumped a drink on my floor. Oh, God. Oh, you know what? It's staying there.
[354.79s -> 367.15s]  It's staying there. I'll deal with it later. God. What a pro. Okay. There's like a cup
[368.65s -> 375.87s]  of milk on my floor right now. That is not cool. Whatever. The show must go on. Let's
[375.87s -> 393.86s]  do it. That's that. And here's the tweet. I can't believe that. Milk doesn't body good.
[394.14s -> 408.51s]  Unless you dump it on your floor. Done. Geez Louise. Does that work? Let's find out. Nice
[408.51s -> 429.11s]  like Avatar. Alright. We're good to go. We're good to go. Okay, now I'm going to make the
[429.11s -> 440.78s]  chat so I can see it. Good Lord. Well, that was not cool. Let's get a server with zero
[440.78s -> 446.13s]  people in it. And my TF2 server is coming along. I know I said last week it was going
[446.13s -> 454.58s]  to be done this week, but it's not. It's close though. I have to talk to the guys at gameservers.com.
[456.23s -> 467.05s]  We have to have a meeting. Some type of meeting. What's up dudes? If you're just joining us,
[467.05s -> 473.15s]  I just spilled a cup of milk on my floor and it's going to stay there until I'm done screaming.
[473.15s -> 476.71s]  Hope I don't like ruin anything. If it like seeps over near my computer, that's going
[476.71s -> 485.70s]  to be really bad. It might have to be like an emergency stop. Alright, let's go to...
[485.70s -> 500.89s]  No, no toot fort. No, Dustbowl. We played Dustbowl too much. How about... I'm a gravel
[500.89s -> 509.16s]  pit. I'm okay with gravel pit. Let's do gravel pit. This is the server. Ladies and gents,
[509.16s -> 519.62s]  head there. Gravel pit. Yeah, Dustbowl is a little overplayed, but I love it though.
[519.62s -> 525.81s]  I love Dustbowl. That's because I'm an old school TF2 player. I mean I've been playing
[525.81s -> 534.09s]  since 2007 and I remember that. There used to only be Dustbowl, two fort, turbine, gravel
[534.13s -> 545.30s]  pit. There was only six maps when TF2 launched. Two fort, Dustbowl, gravel pit, turbine. What
[548.90s -> 553.76s]  were the other two maps? What the hell were the other two maps? Can somebody in the chat
[553.76s -> 562.07s]  throw that out there? Oh, well and granary, right? Those are the only six that came out
[562.19s -> 571.30s]  at release. Let's go blue. Let's go attacking tonight. I feel like being an attacker. No,
[571.30s -> 581.99s]  we're going to start with medic. I'm starting with the medic. Alright, let's get the audio
[581.99s -> 593.02s]  good here. Game audio good. Voice audio is it? Are we getting overpowered? You can never
[593.02s -> 607.83s]  tell. Oh yeah, high five baby. Alright, let's push this point boys. If anyone wants to duel
[607.87s -> 614.22s]  me I will accept it. I'm not going to promise I will win the duel to anyone watching the
[614.22s -> 632.30s]  stream but I will try my best. I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. Follow me doctor. We go.
[632.62s -> 640.06s]  We need this uber or what? Are we good? We're good to go? You know what? I'm going to go
[640.06s -> 652.33s]  not that way. I had to use it. I had to use it. Oh no. Oh no. Oh I shouldn't have left.
[652.33s -> 666.71s]  That wasn't my bad. I screwed that up. James A-hole. We're okay. That guy's going to try
[666.71s -> 671.20s]  shooting the window. We got it, we got it, we got it. Oh give me that sandwich. Spy,
[671.20s -> 680.42s]  where are you? Bastard. There you are. We got to get out of here. We're going to get
[680.42s -> 692.20s]  destroyed. Thank you for saving my life. I don't want to say your name Holland. Very
[692.20s -> 706.30s]  quiet. You're very quiet. What? What? What? I knew I got him. Alright, let's push it.
[706.30s -> 711.19s]  I love your outfit man. I think I said this before last stream but your outfit is unbelievable.
[713.85s -> 727.68s]  It's when we... You know I'm going to protect this guy too. Because for fun. Oh attack.
[727.68s -> 736.94s]  Oh it's the guy I'm dueling. Oh god. That's a spy. That's a spy. Oh get away. Oh damn
[736.94s -> 743.26s]  it. I didn't even know that was the guy I was dueling. I just walked up and punched
[743.26s -> 751.80s]  him in the face. Yeah if you got a duel throw it my way dude. I will duel you. Just a positive
[751.80s -> 770.63s]  elutely. We're going to get A. Let's get A. Oh I have to duel you. I don't even know
[771.03s -> 780.81s]  if I... I don't think I have any duels. I think I gave them all away. Here we go again. Give
[780.81s -> 789.40s]  me that uber. I'm going to be able to push this. Alright crowbar. Let's see what you've
[789.40s -> 805.62s]  got baby. No. No. No. Where are you? Oh no. Get out of my way. Okay. Hi guys. Hello. Get

[860.18s -> 865.85s]  right there. You know I'm going quick fix. Do I even have the quick fix? After my backpack?
[865.85s -> 870.51s]  Oh no that's right I unboxed a strange one. Forgot. I unboxed this. Might as well put
[870.51s -> 883.62s]  it to use right? Let's go scout I want to be able to run fast. Run. Run. Run. Run. Quick
[883.62s -> 902.22s]  fix. Oh yeah. Quick fix. Get him. No. No don't kill the medic. Come here. Run to me.
[902.22s -> 915.09s]  Oh my god die you bastard. Oh my god dude. How many hits did that take? I got a new one.
[915.09s -> 923.39s]  Let's push through this. Let's push through this nonsense into the quick. Quick fix over.
[923.39s -> 934.54s]  Oh what you know about the quick fix over. Come here. Oh you jumped away from me. What
[934.54s -> 946.26s]  the hell? Nice job guys. Good game. Good game. Jerma do you like the yogscast? I don't really
[946.94s -> 952.83s]  watch it to be honest. The yogscast is kind of like a minecraft thing isn't it? Or at
[952.83s -> 958.65s]  least predominantly minecraft? See I have no idea. This is me just I have absolutely
[958.65s -> 968.35s]  no idea. They seem like nice guys. They seem like cool guys. You know I don't. I'm changing.
[968.35s -> 979.90s]  I want the critscreek. I want the critscreek. Can I get it charged before? Well I really
[980.54s -> 993.06s]  I don't have an opinion on it to be honest. Oh I can't high five you. Let's go burger
[993.06s -> 1005.24s]  boy. Optimus Prime is like standing there like a statue. Alright burger boy you better
[1005.24s -> 1014.86s]  be ready to unleash hell on the world. After this critscreek I'm going to. He's dying
[1014.86s -> 1028.26s]  over here. Alright burger boy. Watch out burger boy. I'm holding on to this. I'll come back
[1028.26s -> 1046.54s]  to you. Overheel peeper. Spy here. Spy here. Spy. Put your thing down. Am I a fan of Shibby
[1046.54s -> 1052.54s]  2142? I love Shibby 2142. He's like a friend of mine. He's like a good bud of mine. You
[1052.54s -> 1067.82s]  are. Not real. Oh he's still here. He's still alive. Me and Shibby 2142 are broskies. Just
[1067.82s -> 1080.54s]  shoot a bunch over there. Oh my god. Never mind. I do know Star as well. I'm not as
[1081.78s -> 1090.39s]  close with Star as I am with Shibby but I know Star. We talk. Speaking of Star. We may
[1090.39s -> 1101.77s]  actually be doing videos together sometime soon. Sometime very very soon. He's a cool
[1101.77s -> 1109.93s]  guy though. Stimmy D? Yes. I know Stimmy D. Stimmy D is a bro. Pretty much if you can
[1109.93s -> 1114.41s]  name me like a Team Fortress 2 channel I probably know them. Like I probably like know who they
[1114.41s -> 1123.57s]  are and I've probably spoken to them at least once or twice. Stay alive derp. Do you know
[1123.57s -> 1136.60s]  German985? No. Who's that? He sounds like a real loser. Get rid of this guy. Get rid
[1136.76s -> 1168.27s]  of this guy. That's a spy. What? Alright so my brain just exploded. I walked towards that
[1168.31s -> 1171.91s]  engineer the real one and then I turned around and I thought it was him again and I thought
[1171.91s -> 1192.56s]  it was real so I got fell. That was a good spy. Why are we screaming? But to answer the
[1192.56s -> 1199.66s]  question yes I know most of the Team Fortress 2 channels. I don't know all of them. I mean
[1199.66s -> 1203.96s]  there are probably a few that I've never really had a conversation with or something but for
[1203.96s -> 1217.81s]  the most part I've had a conversation with all of them. Alright that's a spy. No it's
[1217.81s -> 1228.27s]  just a dump machine burger boy. No stay alive dude. I got you. Oh the medic chain. Oh my
[1228.27s -> 1236.21s]  word. I'm getting a little bit of trouble here. I shouldn't be walking out that far.

[1276.03s -> 1290.11s]  sniper head. There we go. That was weird. Let's go scout. All defaults. Uh no I'm alright.
[1290.11s -> 1296.08s]  Optimus Prime. I'm cool. Not right this second. Maybe after when it's all said and done. But
[1296.08s -> 1303.02s]  for now I want to focus on the Zestreem. Just give me a strafe thank you. Yeah we'll do
[1303.02s -> 1316.33s]  it in a minute thanks. You know what I want? I want a strained Huntsman. Oh crap. Ah still

[1353.71s -> 1360.04s]  crate. Oh it's a salvaged crate. It's one of like the rare ones. That's insane. 40 keys.
[1360.04s -> 1376.98s]  If I get a strange Huntsman I know I'm gonna keep it. That's crazy. What's up Millennium
[1376.98s -> 1396.21s]  Boy exoskeleton bug body? Just landed on his head. I got blowed up. I got blowed up. Oh
[1396.21s -> 1400.80s]  sorry Millennium Man. Yeah it's gonna be fun. Well after this round Gold Chain servers.

[1413.27s -> 1418.39s]  Yeah I love all the scatter guns. Except for the Force of Nature it's not my forte. I'm
[1418.39s -> 1427.87s]  not a big fan of it. Let's see if we can't crit some people. Oh my god. That was a death
[1427.87s -> 1432.13s]  wish. I just wanted to see how many hit markers would just pop up. I don't even think I have...
[1432.13s -> 1437.04s]  I don't have... I gave away my backpack. That's the only option I have right now. Where's my...
[1437.04s -> 1442.78s]  What happened to my Mad Bill? Oh right. I probably gave that away. Yeah I gave that away as well.
[1442.78s -> 1459.89s]  Let's close this out boys and girls. Potentially. I want to get that good couple kills with this
[1459.89s -> 1472.53s]  thing Jake. That's a death wish. I'll go the other way. I shall go the other way. Anybody
[1472.53s -> 1482.74s]  over here? Not that I can see. Anyone gonna come out this way? Oh god. I don't think that guy...
[1482.74s -> 1493.86s]  I didn't even see him. Run away! Oh my god. See getting stuck just like saved my life right there.
[1493.86s -> 1506.46s]  I would have got shot right in the back. I would have got shot right in my behind. Crap.
[1506.46s -> 1524.66s]  I'm bumping into somebody. Bumping into somebody. Yep there he is. Help me! Wow! The dead ringer.
[1524.66s -> 1543.58s]  Anybody? Anybody? Oh nine damage. Thank god I did nine damage. Oh man this is bad news. Bad news
[1543.58s -> 1554.83s]  right here. What am I thinking? Oh god. I tied it up at the very end. Oh my god. Right at the very end
[1554.83s -> 1561.94s]  I tied it. Holy crap. Alright good game guys. We are going to change servers now. So thanks guys
[1561.94s -> 1575.15s]  jumping in this one. Don't want anyone. This... I gotta clean this milk up. I gotta clean this mad milk up.
[1575.15s -> 1591.75s]  Viaduct? No that's... I don't know where that is. Five gorge. Could be cool. What else we got?
[1591.75s -> 1601.70s]  Granary? I might be feeling granary right now. I think I'm feeling granary guys. Sawmill or granary?
[1601.70s -> 1616.94s]  Alright. Sawmill or granary? Hmm. Granary it is. We're doing granary. In the reddit server apparently.
[1616.94s -> 1633.26s]  Copy that. Here you go. There's the new server. Granary is one of those maps that you never feel
[1633.26s -> 1638.38s]  like playing on it but once you're actually playing on it you have a good time. I don't know why. Every
[1638.38s -> 1644.02s]  single time I play granary it's like oh do I want to play granary? I don't think so. But then when I
[1644.02s -> 1657.42s]  actually get on it it's like oh this is fun. Oh it just changed to well. Well that's cool. I feel the
[1657.42s -> 1670.57s]  same way about well though to be honest. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Here we go. Here we
[1670.57s -> 1681.98s]  go. I'll go red because I was on blue last time. Maybe not. And maybe so. Nope. Let me join red.
[1681.98s -> 1692.41s]  This time we're gonna play demo. Default demo man. Okay. No no no no no no no no. Strange lock
[1692.41s -> 1711.28s]  and load. Almost forgot. I almost forgot. Mission begins in one second. One. Go! No millennium man.
[1711.28s -> 1742.98s]  Get a better internet. Let's see. Can I kill somebody? Oh man. Millennium man. Will I be
[1742.98s -> 1750.97s]  selling admin on my server? No. I plan on just having people be able to play and I'm sure that
[1751.65s -> 1756.59s]  if you play there for long enough and you're a good supporter of the server I would just give it to
[1756.59s -> 1766.81s]  you. You wouldn't have to pay for it. Save your money. That was a bad jump. And now I'm gonna die
[1766.81s -> 1788.06s]  like instantly. Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. He's behind us.
[1788.06s -> 1806.86s]  He's dead now. I thought he was gonna walk out the door. It's alright. Let me out of here. Oh no. Oh
[1806.86s -> 1816.02s]  no. What's going on? No. I'm gonna drown. Oh my god. I really thought I was gonna drown right there
[1816.02s -> 1853.26s]  guys. I'll die. Watch out behind us. Behind us. Yikes. I got wrecked right when I got over here.
[1853.26s -> 1864.36s]  Damn it. Oh my god. I didn't expect this. Oh I didn't. I didn't even look. I should have been
[1864.36s -> 1877.84s]  looking. I'm an idiot. It's my bad. Top isn't it? Nice job guys. Nice job. Gentlemen and ladies.
[1877.84s -> 1888.52s]  Good job. Gentle ladies and gentlemen. Oh who's that? Who is that? Who am I doing a repression
[1888.52s -> 1909.18s]  up? Oh jump. Mission begins in 30 seconds. We're going across the top. Oh my god. Look who it is
[1909.18s -> 1914.70s]  ladies and gentlemen. Burger boy with like a chocolate melted in his mouth. Oh what am I
[1914.70s -> 1920.65s]  doing? I shouldn't have came this way. Why is that up here? Why is that up here? Who got up here?
[1920.65s -> 1939.93s]  What? How? That must have been from the last round. Oh I'm never gonna hit him. Oh he just like jumped
[1939.93s -> 1960.84s]  into that. Where's my spray? I want a spray. Come on walk all over this. Come on. Come on. Oh let me get him.
[1960.84s -> 1974.04s]  Well at least we got it. It's a pallet. Go this way. Go this way. Go this way. Careful for spies.
[1974.04s -> 1984.89s]  That might be a spy. I think it was. Yes it was. Cartoons. Cartoons. Cartoons. Be careful. We're
[1984.89s -> 2014.95s]  entering the enemy base. Oh man. We might be like a team scramble. Oh get out of town. Oh damn it.
[2016.98s -> 2023.21s]  Oh I thought I thought if I would just be in tryhard mode right there I could just be quietly
[2023.21s -> 2039.48s]  killing my battle. Oh the teams I guess aren't that bad. We could probably use a scramble. Maybe
[2039.48s -> 2057.85s]  not. We'll find out. Going this way. Going this way. There's a dude right here. Oh boy. Heads up.
[2057.85s -> 2075.05s]  Heavy. Oh I thought I was gonna hit him. It's all about that little area. A little corridor. Oh I
[2075.05s -> 2084.22s]  thought he didn't get hit by that. What's up with that? How can we? Oh we're defending this point.
[2084.22s -> 2101.32s]  Oh my god. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Help me. Somebody help me. Oh suicide. I'm gonna die.
[2101.32s -> 2111.77s]  The heavy baby. Uh actually I talked to DJ like last night about it and he's working on more stuff.
[2111.77s -> 2115.77s]  He's a hard worker man. He's got a lot of cool ideas. He's working on a lot of stuff.
[2115.77s -> 2133.51s]  It's coming. It's coming. Well you just scared me. Thought you were an enemy. Oh no. Why did I do
[2133.51s -> 2142.36s]  that? I got behind everybody and no one knew I was there. What is wrong with me? Oh what does
[2142.36s -> 2150.58s]  the matter with me? If I had just like not been a freak show I probably would have had a couple
[2150.58s -> 2177.82s]  of kills right there. Whoa. Oh come on. Come on. All right we're going pyro. Pyro with the flare gun
[2177.82s -> 2184.54s]  and I don't. I do have an agree switch still. I have an agree switch. You gotta use the
[2185.10s -> 2193.43s]  console to enter the server. Enter the server IP. I think it's the tilde key. You have to enable it.
[2193.43s -> 2204.47s]  Hold on a second. I've got to appear offline. Just so those notifications stop popping up
[2204.47s -> 2224.38s]  because nobody wants to see the notifications. They want to see Team Fortress 2. Oh damn it.
[2224.38s -> 2230.97s]  So much stuff going on. No no don't die. I'm trying to save the heavy. What? Who got hit by the bus?
[2230.97s -> 2241.13s]  Somebody got hit by the bus I think. Yeah this is the tilde key if you want to know how to enable
[2241.13s -> 2248.87s]  it. Go to options. Go to advanced and then enable developer console. I want that checked and then
[2248.87s -> 2254.47s]  once that is checked by default it is the tilde key. The thing under escape and it looks like this.
[2254.47s -> 2266.41s]  Then you type in connect space then the IP and then enter and that's it. And that's all she wrote.
[2266.41s -> 2282.90s]  Massive bus accident. Got hit by a train. Oh my god. Oh no. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
[2282.90s -> 2293.69s]  Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I'm gonna spell it out. D-A-M-N-I-T-E.
[2296.06s -> 2300.94s]  I have never played TF2Ware. I've heard it is hysterical though and I am absolutely
[2300.94s -> 2307.56s]  willing to try it. They're pushing us back. They have pushed us all the way back.
[2307.56s -> 2318.44s]  Oh good. I'm hanging out here. TF2Ware is like a WarioWare mod for Team Fortress where you
[2318.44s -> 2323.50s]  get like five seconds to do like a little mini game. It's very funny. I've seen videos on it.
[2323.50s -> 2341.83s]  It looks really entertaining. Jump with them. Oh damn it. Oh god it's chaos. Shoot at me.
[2341.83s -> 2355.70s]  Somebody shoot at me with something. No that was just chaos. Gotta move that gear up.
[2355.70s -> 2361.05s]  Yeah actually I own Garry's Mod. I'm not very good at it though. I know a lot of people in
[2361.05s -> 2368.92s]  Garry's Mod can make ridiculous things. I'm not one of those people. Like oh I made this
[2368.92s -> 2375.00s]  boat that's actually a car. That's actually a house and it moves and these mouths are animated.
[2375.00s -> 2390.63s]  I can't do anything like that. I wish I could. Oh my god. Oh my god. Retreat. Wow. No. No. No.
[2392.49s -> 2400.09s]  There's nothing I can do. Damn it. New server guys. We'll do one more new server and then
[2400.09s -> 2407.24s]  we're going to hop over to Binding of Isaac probably. The last empty server. Where are we
[2407.24s -> 2416.68s]  going to find you? Auxiliary Operation. What the hell is that? One of the 32. No actually
[2416.68s -> 2424.57s]  this one's one of the 28. Badwater. We can end it on Badwater. There you go. Join that server
[2424.57s -> 2438.34s]  right now ladies and gentlemen. That's the new IP. I'll post it again and there it is again.
[2438.34s -> 2451.75s]  Oh man. I'll go defense again. Gonna go big sentry engineer. Oh man this is depressing.
[2451.83s -> 2459.86s]  Where's all my stuff? This is all I have. Where's all my like hats?
[2463.61s -> 2469.27s]  At least I have this. I can look like I can put this on. Wait I can wear this?
[2469.27s -> 2473.59s]  Oh cool. I didn't know I could wear that. That's awesome. Hell yeah I'll wear that.
[2473.59s -> 2499.77s]  I'll wear my ring. Big sentry engineer. Get that built. Get it to uh you know what? Just do an
[2499.77s -> 2518.70s]  entrance. I'm good. I'd rather have like the return to glory. But thank you though Prime.
[2518.70s -> 2531.10s]  Appreciate that. Where's it going? Let's go right here. This is a pretty safe place. Now you know
[2531.10s -> 2542.94s]  what? This is going over here. That's going over here. We're going. We're going. Oh yeah we're on
[2542.94s -> 2549.30s]  fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Hey knuckle heads I'm talking to you. Bonk. Oh what?
[2562.18s -> 2570.65s]  Okay that just scared the crap out of me. That just scared me. Like I really got scared by that.
[2570.65s -> 2579.83s]  Like it was like oh man I'm sorry you guys. If you were in that server and you just got in and
[2579.83s -> 2594.31s]  you I'm I really am sorry. Okay well let's this one is no no I don't want to 12 people in it already.
[2594.31s -> 2609.53s]  Damn that was that was dumb. All right dust bowl. No this one's bad. This is this bots here.
[2609.53s -> 2617.74s]  So if we start to join this it'll get rid of the bots right? That's usually what happens. I'm pretty
[2617.74s -> 2626.90s]  sure that's what happens. So let's try this one. Bad water basin. Hopefully this one doesn't just
[2626.90s -> 2638.46s]  turn off. Insta turn off. I hope you're enjoying your time because it's about to insta turn off.
[2638.46s -> 2644.89s]  All right I'll stick with this. I'll stick with this. Going over here though. Oh you're already
[2644.89s -> 2654.62s]  over there. All right you got that coming. I'm cool. I'll stick with right there. Why is burger
[2654.62s -> 2671.66s]  boy so fat? Hey that's not nice. That's not a nice thing to say about burger boy. This is a bad spot
[2671.66s -> 2677.98s]  for that. I don't know why I put that there. I need to move that eventually. Somebody right there
[2677.98s -> 2685.43s]  can just shoot at it. You know what? I might move my... I'm gonna move it. I'm going up here.
[2685.43s -> 2694.28s]  I'm gonna go over here. Looks like they're not capping. Come on come on come on come on.
[2695.00s -> 2698.28s]  Oh damn it. Damn it. Damn it. He doesn't have the staffer. He doesn't have the staffer. Somebody
[2698.28s -> 2707.62s]  take care of that. You know what? I'm gonna go gunslinger. I have a feeling that's gonna happen
[2707.62s -> 2722.06s]  a thousand more times. I'm gonna give my dispenser to this guy. I'm gonna put it over here in case
[2722.06s -> 2727.11s]  somebody comes and uber charges and kills that. He'll have this backup one in case he needs it.
[2728.58s -> 2743.50s]  There you go sir. Go get some more. I'll be out. They'll be okay. I'm gonna leave. Whoops.
[2743.50s -> 2770.25s]  Didn't mean to click. Ah hell. Run away. Too many sentries in the same spot. That's a double
[2770.25s -> 2783.19s]  mini sentry a lot. Damn it. I got too many spies. Too many spas. Oh engineer. I'm not gonna play
[2783.19s -> 2791.66s]  with you. I'll go soldier. Soldier with the strange liberty launcher and the italian's backup. Why not?
[2791.66s -> 2800.60s]  Might as well. And the strange has to touch. Do I want a vintage huntsman? I'm good. I'll be okay.
[2800.60s -> 2810.02s]  Thank you though. I'd rather like I said before rather you guys keep your stuff as you could use
[2810.02s -> 2823.24s]  it too. Oh my god. It's fantastic. I'm dead instantly. I didn't even see them. Oh they're
[2823.24s -> 2836.95s]  gonna win. Well no. No no. I want the. If I would. I mean any weapon of my choice if I would have
[2836.95s -> 2841.35s]  wanted. Strange huntsman everyone was just talking about. My god it's worth like 50 million dollars
[2841.35s -> 2853.85s]  or something. Worth 500 thousand million trillion dollars. Let's get on a streak here. What do you
[2853.85s -> 2864.34s]  say Jerma? Let's get on a streak. Reserved shooter would have been like a better option.
[2865.30s -> 2885.46s]  Oh pull here. Be careful. Oh boy he's in trouble. Watch out man. He's trying to pull us. Oh this is
[2885.46s -> 2897.03s]  a losing fight. This is a losing fight. Gotta get away. Oh come on. Look at his health. Look at his
[2897.03s -> 2908.15s]  health. Should you use your three refine to craft a hat or should you trade it? Um it depends what
[2908.15s -> 2914.90s]  hat you want because if you go into a trading server you can for a lot of a lot of the time
[2914.90s -> 2919.96s]  you can get one hat for one refine. Like one of those craftable hats. It really depends if you want
[2920.63s -> 2925.99s]  just a hat. Because you could potentially get like three hats with three refine. Or if you want to
[2925.99s -> 2934.33s]  like just make a random one and potentially get one of the new ones. Got a new email apparently.
[2934.33s -> 2970.22s]  Check that after I die. Well he's going up here. You're not a spy. Oh my god there's a sentry. Oh
[2970.22s -> 2977.27s]  they're gonna get it. They're gonna get it. Gotta get rid of that sentry. Even if I die damn it damn
[2977.27s -> 2983.48s]  it damn it. Oh he's standing right there. The difference between dirty and clean items I really
[2983.48s -> 2992.46s]  don't know. I'm not a real big trader so I'm not really sure all will then go. I think clean is
[2992.46s -> 3009.00s]  when it doesn't say who crafted it. Isn't that what it means? Oh uncraftable okay. I think we're
[3009.00s -> 3049.11s]  good. I think we got it. Oh run. I don't have my equalizer for spy too. I didn't even see what
[3049.11s -> 3052.47s]  I'm sorry. I'm looking back and forth at the chat in the game. What hat are you talking about?
[3052.47s -> 3061.53s]  Let's see do you want the hat Jerma? Just read. I'm like wait what hat? I would I would like it if
[3061.53s -> 3067.08s]  I you guys don't have to give me anything. I got I got plenty of stuff. I got plenty of options
[3067.08s -> 3071.40s]  where I can get things. You guys hold on to your items. They're your hard earned items. You guys
[3071.40s -> 3090.02s]  deserve them not me. There's a lot of people right there. Oh crit. Oh. Outside 100 I have a setup
[3090.02s -> 3096.49s]  video. If you go to my YouTube channel and you type in 4,000 subs. I did like a 4,000 subscriber
[3096.49s -> 3102.47s]  thing a long long time ago and it's a setup video and it's got the same I got the same computer so
[3102.47s -> 3108.01s]  I'm probably gonna get a new computer at some point in the near future. I would assume probably
[3108.01s -> 3121.67s]  in the next couple months I will get a new computer. Well it's over. You failed. You failed.
[3124.25s -> 3132.62s]  All right so I think I'm going to transition over to Binding of Isaac for like one life or
[3132.62s -> 3155.80s]  two lives or something like that. We'll see what I do. Binding of Isaac is a really weird really
[3155.80s -> 3163.03s]  disturbing kind of uh it's it's made in flash I think but it's a steam game you can get it's
[3163.03s -> 3168.30s]  five bucks it's very very disturbing and very screwed up so I will put that disclaimer out
[3168.30s -> 3177.74s]  there before uh I stream it but yeah thank you guys if you were just here for the tf2 then
[3177.74s -> 3182.84s]  thank you so much for coming and watching you guys rock and roll and I'll catch you guys probably
[3182.84s -> 3196.76s]  next time and oh I'm being hit in the face by a frying pan okay all right let's do some Binding
[3196.76s -> 3211.45s]  of Isaac no hold on to your hats hold on to your hats hold on to your seats now let me see if I can
[3211.45s -> 3233.64s]  stream this actually got to change this on here too on the dash the dashboard dashboard playing
[3234.57s -> 3247.98s]  Binding of Isaac update yeah I gotta change my background actually you know what let's change
[3247.98s -> 3261.22s]  my background because this has been my background for a very long time let's change the background
[3261.22s -> 3274.01s]  all right so let's do personalize uh desktop backgrounds desktop background all right so do
[3274.01s -> 3281.75s]  I want like the space needle oh god am I might be like breaking the stream maybe not let's see
[3281.75s -> 3294.82s]  okay I'm not I think I like the space needle put up a photo of grandpa what about the ice one
[3294.82s -> 3305.14s]  oh sleek oh what about this one oh man oh this is that's that this is the one this is the one
[3305.14s -> 3314.68s]  I'm keeping look at this thing that thing is beautiful save changes look at this gorgeous
[3314.68s -> 3328.76s]  gorgeous screen it's like a painting all right it's okay so let's play Binding of Isaac so uh
[3328.76s -> 3336.12s]  disclaimer Binding of Isaac is an incredibly messed up disturbing crazy insane game uh so viewer
[3336.12s -> 3343.78s]  discretion is advised I'm going to say that before playing because obviously this game is uh ridiculous
[3343.78s -> 3349.30s]  hopefully uh the stream doesn't die I don't think it will
[3355.66s -> 3386.60s]  audio is gonna have to come down okay change this screen's gonna go black black screen screen
[3386.60s -> 3408.38s]  region this stretch it out all righty Binding of Isaac so I'm pretty good at this game I've
[3408.38s -> 3416.10s]  become pretty good at this game I love this game it is so much fun it's just so addicting go with
[3416.10s -> 3430.63s]  the cane got the eye patch all right let's do it the reason why I'm playing this again is because
[3430.63s -> 3438.18s]  the DLC is coming out in the next couple of days I think the Binding of Isaac DLC should be out soon
[3438.18s -> 3458.82s]  in the meantime I'm gonna run around like a psycho so if you like games that are they call these
[3458.82s -> 3468.50s]  roguelikes don't they have roguelike dungeon crawlers the real blizzard 10121 how do you
[3468.50s -> 3475.50s]  become a mod on the stream um usually the mods are people are people that I that I'm like friends
[3475.50s -> 3480.55s]  with that I talk to all the time and stuff like that but yeah I mean if you if you've been coming
[3480.55s -> 3486.52s]  for that long and you know I'll probably set up some type of way to get a mod uh a way for you to
[3486.52s -> 3491.24s]  get mod or wait for people to get mod if they want it but it's hard to give mods to people
[3491.24s -> 3495.46s]  because there's just so many people that that would want it so it's very very difficult to say
[3495.46s -> 3501.40s]  oh yeah you can be a mod sure oh triple shot this is gonna be a good game this is gonna be a good
[3501.48s -> 3508.28s]  game it's but it's it's hard to give out mod specifically because it's just so many people
[3508.28s -> 3513.30s]  want it so if I were to give it to one person and you know somebody else would be like well I want
[3513.30s -> 3520.62s]  mod too and it's like uh yeah it's a very tough decision to make so but eventually I will probably
[3520.62s -> 3535.26s]  do I will probably do a some type of way to get it I don't know how though triple shot is incredible
[3535.26s -> 3541.48s]  get triple shot extra damage more tears you're talking about absolute chaos let me get that
[3541.48s -> 3554.01s]  bomb and open up a secret room for crying out loud spread gun oh no it was the troll bomb fly
[3554.01s -> 3560.02s]  contest mod giveaway you know what I pro you know what we're that's a will do I'll do some type of
[3564.39s -> 3570.70s]  I don't know I don't know it's hard I'll tell you one thing for those of you that are hanging out
[3570.70s -> 3577.16s]  here I'm going to do I'm gonna make a video I'm gonna do a video on this in the next couple of
[3577.16s -> 3586.09s]  days next week's stream it's going to be very very interesting because I'm gonna do a game show
[3586.09s -> 3592.97s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna uh let me try and explain this I'm gonna buy like another like 30 or 40
[3592.97s -> 3599.59s]  keys and get a bunch of crates and what we're gonna do is we're gonna do like a trivia night
[3599.59s -> 3607.96s]  where I have the screen open it's on team fortress 2 so the screens open on team fortress 2 like 40
[3607.96s -> 3613.86s]  crates with 40 keys and I'm gonna ask trivia questions like basic like gaming trivia questions
[3613.86s -> 3618.98s]  it's not gonna be all totally team fortress though so it might be some other general gaming
[3618.98s -> 3623.40s]  questions and if you get it right if you're the first person to get it in the chat then you get to
[3623.40s -> 3628.68s]  pick which crate you want to unlock and I just thought I thought about that the other day I was
[3628.68s -> 3635.14s]  like you know that would be actually really cool it'd be fun so that's the plan for next and I'm
[3635.14s -> 3639.46s]  gonna make a video on this if you're watching this on YouTube and you're like oh wait wait wait what
[3639.46s -> 3650.70s]  I want more details there's gonna be a video made about that very very soon yes you will get what's
[3650.70s -> 3655.78s]  inside if you open if you get the trivia question correct you can open up whatever's in whatever
[3655.78s -> 3660.15s]  crate you want you get whatever's in there it doesn't matter if it's a five million dollar
[3660.15s -> 3669.64s]  unusual or paint you're gonna get it oh no no no no get out of my way I don't want to tie this
[3669.64s -> 3686.78s]  early triple shot yeah if you want if you guys have crates I mean I know I did a crate people
[3686.78s -> 3692.84s]  donated a lot to the last one but if you have crates if you have you know I've series 20 and
[3692.84s -> 3706.81s]  above anything lower than series 20 I don't think I would want but it's just a way to involve
[3706.81s -> 3711.21s]  everybody because I think that'd just be fun like a trivia night you know what I mean like all right
[3711.21s -> 3717.86s]  in what level of like Legend of Zelda do you like just anything like that do you find the
[3717.86s -> 3722.86s]  Master Sword or something just general basic trivia questions a lot of people would get involved
[3722.86s -> 3731.21s]  it'd be really fun and hopefully somebody gets something cool sloth what you got nothing on me
[3731.21s -> 3742.47s]  you got nothing on me my triple shot baby there would be a lot of Team Fortress questions though
[3742.47s -> 3750.94s]  like oh in what crate can you get a strange Jirani oh I'm gonna die I'm like too busy talking about
[3750.94s -> 3754.30s]  what I'm doing though my next stream I'm like not even paying attention to this one
[3754.30s -> 3762.70s]  I have to use it oh what am I doing I didn't have to use that I could have used it in a
[3762.70s -> 3767.48s]  whatever whatever that's me being a really really dumb stupid person but you know what
[3767.48s -> 3775.75s]  at least I can see everything get room see the rooms right there what I need is I need
[3775.75s -> 3801.78s]  damage up I know I have a stealth I know I know I know so is the music too loud right now I feel
[3801.78s -> 3817.64s]  like it is or am I just freaking out oh come on hit him okay because you know I have headphones
[3817.72s -> 3827.22s]  on so it's kind of tough me to decipher how loud something is or not and open up that secret room
[3827.22s -> 3839.27s]  baby three dollars or three pennies not dollars that's not a total waste of a secret room how do
[3839.27s -> 3845.67s]  you get the crates to me I'll probably set up some type of way everybody doesn't have to give them
[3845.67s -> 3861.67s]  though because obviously I only need like 30 or 40 of them I want to give you stuff should you get
[3861.67s -> 3870.14s]  this game I'm going to 100% absolutely 100 million percent say yes yes yes a million times this is an
[3870.14s -> 3877.72s]  incredibly fun incredibly addictive game it's just like a like 17 and up like this is this game is
[3877.72s -> 3884.20s]  not designed for like younger people to play only because of the incredibly like blasphemous
[3884.20s -> 3889.88s]  and ridiculous imagery that is associated with it but if you don't care about that then this game
[3889.88s -> 3895.02s]  is one of the most fun addictive probably one of the best games I've ever played that's under
[3895.02s -> 3907.62s]  ten dollars this game's only five bucks this game is five dollars on steam yikes that's insane
[3907.62s -> 3914.20s]  this was actually supposed to be ported to the 3ds but Nintendo said uh uh uh that's not happening
[3914.20s -> 3925.14s]  I don't want the kamikaze thing do I even have enough money for anything I don't think so it's
[3925.14s -> 3930.10s]  not even worth opening this door not even worth opening the door I don't even have enough money to
[3931.06s -> 3944.12s]  get anything in there oh come on hit him I got the triple shot why am I missing so much yeah
[3944.12s -> 3954.31s]  Nintendo said because of religious and blasphemous the game is just really very very dark so it is
[3954.31s -> 3961.32s]  only on the only place you can get it I don't think it's on xbox live oh look a sun card might
[3961.32s -> 3976.12s]  as well like waste it this boss's butt give an eye I'm like tempted to just use the sun card
[3976.12s -> 3981.69s]  and not have to even fight this guy but you know what I'm not gonna do it we will do this the right
[3981.69s -> 4001.10s]  way I'm trying to get rid of the baby first I don't think I can though I need more tears
[4001.10s -> 4015.72s]  not shooting fast enough something from the future I unlocked some now in the basement speed up I
[4015.72s -> 4024.42s]  would use the sun card but honestly it's just it's a uh it's a oh crap moment like I'm gonna die I'm
[4024.42s -> 4034.58s]  gonna die use it I'll bank I will take whatever is in there take that key thank you very much
[4035.14s -> 4044.49s]  how do you play this game it's just with the keyboard and you just go from room to room
[4044.49s -> 4050.07s]  clearing out all the monsters just like legend of Zelda or star tropics or other games that are
[4050.07s -> 4054.68s]  around the same design philosophy once you kill every single thing in the room you see in the
[4054.68s -> 4059.96s]  top left of the map and see what rooms are open that you can go to fight the boss you kill the
[4059.96s -> 4068.04s]  boss you go on to the next level and if you die it's over cannot continue there is no lives there's
[4068.04s -> 4074.41s]  no continuing you just die I have to start all over again this is gonna be a room where I might
[4074.41s -> 4086.34s]  have to be just take this nice and slow I'll be okay I might not need to use the sun card there
[4086.34s -> 4102.87s]  we go yeah you big fat red bastard oh question is I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it the coin and
[4102.87s -> 4118.62s]  the bomb back huh hmm I'll take that yeah money money lots of money now if I see an item room I
