[4.60s -> 9.36s]  Okay, I am back. Hello. How are you? Good to see you.
[11.65s -> 16.75s]  Yeah, before we get started before we like kind of continue though. I um, you know, I'm thinking about retiring.
[16.75s -> 20.25s]  No, I'm getting older. So I'm just thinking about. I'm thinking about retiring.
[20.25s -> 21.25s]  I'm thinking about retiring.
[21.25s -> 22.25s]  No, I'm getting older.
[22.25s -> 23.25s]  I'm thinking about retiring.
[24.25s -> 29.87s]  You know, I mean.
[29.87s -> 35.87s]  Oh shit, I have to gift subs. I can't though. I don't have it. My money won't go through to Twitch.
[36.37s -> 42.67s]  I didn't say how many I'll give you. I'll give you an extra ten. Okay, that'll be a hundred and ten.
[42.67s -> 49.60s]  I was making a joke. It's like I talk about this shit all the time and I'm just a fucking like, alright.
[49.60s -> 51.60s]  No, I'm not gonna talk about retiring anymore.
[51.60s -> 55.82s]  I'll give you ten. I'll give you ten.
[55.82s -> 59.82s]  I can't even fucking connect my Twitch to my fucking payment stuff.
[59.82s -> 63.54s]  Just real debt. Add it to the tab.
[63.54s -> 67.54s]  Alright, let's do AI dungeon. Isn't that gonna be fun guys?
[67.54s -> 69.97s]  Maybe I should get some music for this.
[69.97s -> 72.53s]  Like epic royalty free music.
[75.89s -> 76.89s]  I don't know how it works, right?
[76.89s -> 88.22s]  Yeah, I'll get some epic royalty free music.
[88.22s -> 94.83s]  Uh, royalty free scary.
[94.83s -> 101.85s]  Okay. This one sounds promising.
[101.85s -> 103.85s]  One hour of royalty free horror music.
[103.85s -> 108.01s]  Do a clash of clans.
[108.01s -> 111.01s]  Well, this is just to have the background sounds for when we do our adventure.
[111.01s -> 115.51s]  Epic royalty free music.
[115.51s -> 122.72s]  This is uh, okay, this is called fire and thunder.
[122.72s -> 124.72s]  What does this one sound like?
[124.72s -> 129.88s]  I like it.
[129.88s -> 132.79s]  It's not bad.
[136.79s -> 137.97s]  Okay.
[137.97s -> 140.97s]  We need a, like, just generic general medieval music.
[140.97s -> 151.65s]  Okay, this is um, fantasy medieval music, instrumental, no copyright.
[151.65s -> 158.07s]  Okay.
[158.07s -> 161.42s]  Okay.
[161.42s -> 165.73s]  So, apparently, AI dungeon is a lot different now, I guess.
[165.73s -> 166.73s]  Right?
[166.73s -> 176.90s]  I don't know exactly what that means, but I know that apparently it's been, it's changed.
[176.90s -> 189.44s]  Now, I don't know exactly what that means, but I'm gonna try to figure out what it means.
[189.94s -> 193.94s]  I have premium on AI dungeon, and I have premium on novel AI as well.
[193.94s -> 197.78s]  I'm gonna do face cam finally.
[197.78s -> 199.78s]  I'll put it on for a few minutes.
[199.78s -> 209.04s]  Go ahead and do this.
[209.04s -> 211.44s]  Close that.
[211.44s -> 218.09s]  I need to put some lip balm on, though.
[218.09s -> 222.84s]  I gotta change the, uh, we aren't flipping, we are building.
[222.84s -> 224.84s]  I guess that could make sense in AI dungeon.
[224.84s -> 233.00s]  Okay.
[233.00s -> 237.50s]  Looks good.
[237.50s -> 246.57s]  Move this.
[246.57s -> 248.57s]  I have, like, the Voyager thing.
[248.57s -> 252.67s]  I don't think that really matters, though.
[252.67s -> 255.17s]  Okay, so this is, this is what I remember.
[255.17s -> 261.61s]  Move the screen around for you.
[261.61s -> 267.39s]  Can you see it?
[267.39s -> 268.39s]  Not yet.
[268.39s -> 271.49s]  I got a clue.
[271.49s -> 272.49s]  Like, this is still open.
[272.49s -> 277.76s]  Okay.
[277.76s -> 281.73s]  Make sure you can see the chat window.
[281.73s -> 283.29s]  Important.
[283.29s -> 294.27s]  Make it a little bigger so you can read it better.
[294.27s -> 301.22s]  So, what do we want to do?
[301.22s -> 302.22s]  Where do we want to go?
[302.22s -> 308.94s]  What setting do we want?
[308.94s -> 311.70s]  Fantasy, mystery, apocalyptic.
[311.70s -> 323.81s]  We can make, just make up one on our own, too, right?
[323.81s -> 328.73s]  Where should I be?
[328.73s -> 331.23s]  Oh, I gotta turn my ring light on!
[331.23s -> 333.23s]  I can't be sitting here like this.
[333.23s -> 337.23s]  Oh, okay, let's do, let's do, uh, apocalyptic.
[337.23s -> 347.98s]  Oh, a nice warm light.
[347.98s -> 351.69s]  With a coffee.
[351.69s -> 352.69s]  That's better.
[352.69s -> 353.69s]  There.
[353.69s -> 355.87s]  Although, why am I so frame-ready?
[355.87s -> 359.57s]  I'm too, like, I'm too, I look weird.
[359.57s -> 360.57s]  Why?
[360.57s -> 368.81s]  Why does it, why do I look weird?
[368.81s -> 373.72s]  I look even weirder.
[373.72s -> 377.60s]  I'm, why is it so frame-ready?
[377.60s -> 380.67s]  You guys see what I'm talking about?
[380.67s -> 383.95s]  I shouldn't, there we go.
[383.95s -> 384.95s]  That was weird.
[384.95s -> 393.72s]  Now I don't look like I'm red.
[393.72s -> 399.09s]  Too much lip balm?
[399.09s -> 404.88s]  Alright, you don't need to see the Reddit shelf anymore.
[404.88s -> 407.12s]  I look a little disheveled, don't I?
[407.12s -> 408.12s]  Alright.
[408.12s -> 409.86s]  Here we go.
[409.86s -> 414.80s]  So, what music should I have on?
[414.80s -> 416.80s]  I got my coffee right here!
[416.80s -> 424.27s]  I told you I was gonna make one.
[424.27s -> 429.78s]  Ah, harsh noises.
[429.78s -> 431.98s]  Where?
[431.98s -> 433.48s]  Alright, what should, let's go.
[433.48s -> 434.98s]  Uh, it's been a while.
[434.98s -> 436.98s]  Let's go ahead and do, let's do apocalyptic.
[436.98s -> 438.48s]  So, we'll do four.
[438.48s -> 441.30s]  Do I have to click it or just say it?
[441.30s -> 442.30s]  What do I do, nothing?
[442.30s -> 443.65s]  Okay.
[443.65s -> 445.15s]  What character do I want to be?
[445.15s -> 448.52s]  How about a, um, what character?
[448.52s -> 452.05s]  I don't know.
[452.05s -> 453.55s]  What would you guys want to see?
[453.55s -> 456.62s]  How about just, like, a survivor?
[456.62s -> 460.01s]  Survivor sounds good.
[460.01s -> 461.01s]  Your character's name.
[461.01s -> 462.51s]  Let's get some good music here.
[462.51s -> 465.00s]  Gotta make sure this just sounds good.
[465.00s -> 470.30s]  This doesn't make much sense for where we are, but whatever.
[470.30s -> 472.54s]  I gotta make sure my voice changer works, too,
[472.54s -> 474.54s]  for, like, the monsters and demons and everything.
[474.54s -> 475.72s]  Hello.
[475.72s -> 477.72s]  Hello!
[477.72s -> 479.71s]  Oh, hello there, traveler.
[479.71s -> 481.71s]  Yeah, okay, if that sounds okay.
[481.71s -> 489.31s]  Ed, Edgwood.
[489.31s -> 491.19s]  Edgwood.
[491.19s -> 494.99s]  Okay, here we go.
[494.99s -> 499.16s]  Ahem, ahem.
[499.16s -> 501.49s]  You...
[501.49s -> 503.99s]  Wait, this pictures now?
[503.99s -> 506.30s]  This is one of their photos.
[506.30s -> 511.32s]  Okay.
[511.32s -> 514.26s]  You are Edgwood.
[514.26s -> 516.76s]  A survivor trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world
[516.76s -> 519.76s]  by scavenging among the ruins of what is left.
[519.76s -> 522.76s]  You have a backpack and a canteen.
[522.76s -> 525.02s]  You haven't eaten in two days,
[525.02s -> 527.52s]  so you're desperately searching for food.
[527.52s -> 530.02s]  You enter a run-down building and...
[530.02s -> 533.52s]  find it occupied by a man and his two children.
[533.52s -> 537.02s]  They lit a fire in the fireplace to keep themselves warm.
[537.02s -> 539.52s]  You can see a sack of potatoes on a shelf
[539.52s -> 542.52s]  and a closed tin of peaches in the fridge.
[542.52s -> 544.02s]  As you reach to grab the peaches,
[544.02s -> 546.02s]  you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye.
[546.02s -> 548.02s]  Don't move, the man says.
[548.02s -> 551.22s]  Did I just, like, break into this person's house?
[551.22s -> 554.38s]  What happens now?
[554.38s -> 557.38s]  Okay, so from what I remember, you have to, like...
[557.38s -> 559.18s]  Do, okay.
[559.18s -> 561.18s]  Do, what do you say, what happens next?
[561.18s -> 562.68s]  So what do I do?
[562.68s -> 572.33s]  Take the peaches out of the fridge.
[572.33s -> 576.10s]  Does that ma- Is that okay?
[576.10s -> 580.59s]  That's okay, right?
[580.59s -> 586.09s]  You take the peaches out of the fridge.
[586.09s -> 592.35s]  Training the AI, please tap on the response
[592.35s -> 594.85s]  you'd like to keep or hit undo.
[594.85s -> 600.52s]  I've got the peaches, you say in a cheery tone.
[600.52s -> 602.02s]  Oh, thank you, thank you so much.
[602.02s -> 603.52s]  My wife and I have been eating those for two days
[603.52s -> 605.52s]  and she's got nothing left.
[605.52s -> 607.02s]  No worries, I'm just passing through.
[607.02s -> 608.02s]  Don't try and stop me.
[608.02s -> 609.52s]  There's a lot of zombies out there.
[609.52s -> 614.03s]  Or you quickly put the peaches back into the original sack.
[614.03s -> 617.90s]  That done you turn to leave, the man is suddenly on you.
[617.90s -> 619.90s]  Where'd you get those peaches, he asks.
[619.90s -> 621.90s]  Why, are they gonna hurt me?
[621.90s -> 624.27s]  No, but I'm going to.
[624.27s -> 625.77s]  Keep them.
[625.77s -> 628.27s]  The man then draws a gun and points it at you.
[628.27s -> 631.98s]  We're gonna go with this one.
[631.98s -> 633.48s]  Why did I make this decision?
[633.48s -> 635.48s]  I don't know, it's, it's funnier?
[635.48s -> 643.41s]  Okay, the man draws a gun and points it at you.
[646.20s -> 655.80s]  I'm gonna say, you would shoot me in front of your children?
[655.80s -> 660.22s]  You would shoot me in front of your children?
[660.22s -> 665.07s]  Turn that feature off, yeah, I will.
[665.07s -> 667.07s]  You would shoot me in front of your children?
[667.07s -> 676.71s]  I might, you wouldn't, try me.
[676.71s -> 678.21s]  Fine, I won't shoot you.
[678.21s -> 679.71s]  Good, now put the gun down.
[679.71s -> 681.71s]  He does so, you slowly approach him,
[681.71s -> 683.71s]  still not taking your eyes off of him.
[683.71s -> 685.71s]  You're only a few feet away now.
[685.71s -> 689.59s]  Keep a lookout, you whisper.
[689.59s -> 690.59s]  I know.
[690.59s -> 693.47s]  So the gun has legs.
[693.47s -> 698.33s]  Who is this person?
[698.33s -> 703.84s]  I grab the gun out of his hands.
[703.84s -> 714.20s]  Grab the gun out of his hands?
[714.20s -> 728.77s]  You grab the gun out of his hands and turn to leave.
[728.77s -> 731.20s]  Where are you going, he asks.
[731.20s -> 733.51s]  I'm getting somewhere safe.
[733.51s -> 737.25s]  But I thought you, oh, never mind, it doesn't matter.
[737.25s -> 740.75s]  He then picks up the gun again and points it at you.
[740.75s -> 742.75s]  I took it from him, that doesn't make any sense.
[742.75s -> 747.68s]  He got that from somewhere else.
[747.68s -> 753.22s]  Point my gun at him.
[753.22s -> 759.22s]  You point your gun at him.
[759.22s -> 765.24s]  Don't you shoot, he says.
[765.24s -> 767.24s]  I won't if you don't.
[767.24s -> 768.24s]  You're a good boy.
[768.24s -> 771.24s]  You'll get your fill of good food and nice warm beds.
[771.24s -> 772.60s]  I hope so.
[772.60s -> 773.60s]  Now get out of here.
[773.60s -> 775.60s]  I've got a business to run after this is all over.
[775.60s -> 776.60s]  Bye.
[776.60s -> 784.67s]  Shoot into the ceiling.
[784.67s -> 793.60s]  You shoot the man in the head with your gun.
[793.60s -> 794.60s]  He slumps down.
[794.60s -> 798.60s]  You quickly look around and make sure his children have not seen you or heard this.
[798.60s -> 799.60s]  They haven't.
[799.60s -> 801.60s]  You then leave the room.
[801.60s -> 805.84s]  You exit the rundown building and find yourself in a street full of overturned vehicles and debris.
[805.84s -> 809.84s]  You see the man with the two children coming down the street.
[809.84s -> 818.36s]  Um, I wanted to like be like, boom, like, see you later.
[818.36s -> 830.88s]  I'm not pointing my gun.
[830.88s -> 835.88s]  Exit the rundown building and find yourself in a street full of overturned vehicles and debris.
[835.88s -> 839.36s]  What should I do?
[839.36s -> 842.82s]  This is a post-apocalyptic.
[842.82s -> 848.16s]  Okay.
[848.16s -> 850.16s]  Run towards the zombies.
[850.16s -> 854.32s]  I'll lose him in the zombies.
[854.32s -> 860.14s]  You run towards the zombies as fast as you can.
[860.14s -> 863.14s]  You are worried about being seen by the man with the gun.
[863.14s -> 866.14s]  You're also worried about the safety of the peaches.
[866.14s -> 868.14s]  Because, heaven forbid, something happens to those.
[868.14s -> 873.38s]  You continue moving towards the zombies when the man with the gun fires and the bullet hits the zombie in the chest.
[873.38s -> 877.38s]  You hear a satisfying crack as the zombie collapses to the ground.
[877.38s -> 878.38s]  You keep running.
[878.38s -> 884.93s]  Protect the peaches.
[884.93s -> 888.64s]  You protect the peaches.
[888.64s -> 893.87s]  You grab the peaches and tuck them into your bag.
[893.87s -> 896.87s]  Don't shoot, you yell, as you continue running towards the man.
[896.87s -> 897.87s]  No, I want to run that way.
[897.87s -> 898.87s]  I didn't shoot.
[898.87s -> 899.87s]  I didn't shoot.
[899.87s -> 900.87s]  The gun went off by itself.
[900.87s -> 904.17s]  I was just reaching for the bullets to stop the bleeding.
[904.17s -> 905.17s]  Shut up, you say as you run.
[905.17s -> 906.17s]  You need to get off the street.
[906.17s -> 918.40s]  This is stupid.
[918.40s -> 921.53s]  Eat the peaches in front of the man.
[921.53s -> 927.46s]  This AI imaging is just so fucked up.
[927.46s -> 930.46s]  You bite into a peach and you find yourself in a world of flavor and sunshine.
[930.46s -> 933.89s]  You smile from ear to ear.
[933.89s -> 936.89s]  You should have shot the bastards, the man says as he picks up another peach.
[936.89s -> 938.89s]  I can't shoot straight, you say.
[938.89s -> 940.89s]  That's what you get for eating garbage, he says.
[940.89s -> 942.89s]  What the fuck is happening in this story?
[942.89s -> 948.08s]  I'll say.
[948.08s -> 953.34s]  Do you want to join forces?
[953.34s -> 957.28s]  We could work together.
[957.28s -> 960.59s]  Fight zombies.
[960.59s -> 968.01s]  Ashley is pretty accurate though.
[968.01s -> 973.13s]  We weren't supposed to talk to each other, he says.
[973.13s -> 975.13s]  We are not supposed to be here in the first place, you yell.
[975.13s -> 976.13s]  You're right.
[976.13s -> 977.13s]  Let's work together.
[977.13s -> 978.13s]  You decide to work together.
[978.13s -> 980.13s]  The man pulls out a canteen of water and gives you some.
[980.13s -> 987.88s]  Break the entire canteen.
[987.88s -> 991.78s]  Please verify your email address.
[991.78s -> 994.56s]  What?
[994.56s -> 998.44s]  What do you mean verify my, I already did all this.
[998.44s -> 1004.68s]  I already verified my email.
[1004.68s -> 1012.76s]  Hold on.
[1012.76s -> 1015.76s]  What do you mean, verify my email address?
[1015.76s -> 1026.00s]  That's part of the story?
[1026.00s -> 1027.17s]  Try the other one.
[1027.17s -> 1029.17s]  Should I try novel AI instead?
[1029.17s -> 1038.41s]  I already did verify my email, that's fucked up.
[1038.41s -> 1039.41s]  I'll try the other one.
[1039.41s -> 1042.61s]  Is it that much different?
[1042.61s -> 1050.15s]  Okay, text adventure.
[1050.15s -> 1051.15s]  Should I do this one?
[1051.15s -> 1052.15s]  Which one should I do?
[1052.15s -> 1056.35s]  Tall streamer at hotmail.
[1056.35s -> 1064.72s]  All right, I'll do text adventure.
[1064.72s -> 1066.72s]  All right, what do you, let's just, I guess we can just do this one.
[1066.72s -> 1076.28s]  AI dungeon lost the rights to use open AI so they had to make a new AI and it's just not as good as that.
[1076.28s -> 1077.28s]  Really?
[1077.28s -> 1079.84s]  Well, I got a change that says I'm playing.
[1079.84s -> 1088.36s]  Does it have a thing on Twitch?
[1088.36s -> 1090.36s]  It does, okay.
[1090.36s -> 1092.56s]  Okay.
[1092.56s -> 1097.87s]  Well, we'll just do this one.
[1097.87s -> 1100.87s]  There's other stuff on that AI dungeon website though that looked interesting.
[1100.87s -> 1103.81s]  Okay, so let's get started here.
[1103.81s -> 1106.37s]  All right, new track.
[1106.37s -> 1111.62s]  What would you like to do?
[1111.62s -> 1112.62s]  Story.
[1112.62s -> 1114.24s]  Okay, let's start a story.
[1114.24s -> 1120.00s]  You are lost in the woods.
[1120.00s -> 1129.86s]  Your name is, you are lost in the woods.
[1129.86s -> 1137.80s]  Your name is Edward III.
[1137.80s -> 1147.16s]  Your father is Edward the Great.
[1147.16s -> 1162.15s]  And he has sent you into the woods to claim a relic that has been lost for over 200 centuries.
[1162.15s -> 1164.15s]  Is that long?
[1164.15s -> 1165.90s]  Edgeworth?
[1165.90s -> 1168.42s]  What's Edgeworth?
[1168.42s -> 1169.42s]  Edward.
[1169.42s -> 1171.66s]  This is a run-on sentence.
[1171.66s -> 1173.66s]  The AI doesn't care about run-on sentences.
[1173.66s -> 1182.70s]  You have a rusty knife and a trusty sword.
[1182.70s -> 1185.86s]  Begin.
[1185.86s -> 1192.43s]  As you walk deeper into the woods, you see an old man sitting on a rock.
[1192.43s -> 1193.43s]  He looks like he's sleeping.
[1193.43s -> 1195.43s]  You approach him cautiously.
[1195.43s -> 1198.43s]  But as you get closer, he suddenly sits up, staring at you with bloodshot eyes.
[1198.43s -> 1200.43s]  That's 20,000 years.
[1200.43s -> 1213.32s]  Are you serious?
[1213.32s -> 1217.05s]  Say.
[1217.05s -> 1227.61s]  Dear old man, I'm looking for a relic that has been lost time.
[1227.61s -> 1237.44s]  Dear old man, I'm looking for a relic that's been lost time.
[1237.44s -> 1239.44s]  The old man laughs.
[1239.44s -> 1241.44s]  That's exactly what I am.
[1241.44s -> 1247.44s]  I am the relic master of the forest, and I know every relic in this forest by heart.
[1247.44s -> 1250.76s]  What do you want from me?
[1250.76s -> 1255.84s]  Holy shit.
[1255.84s -> 1264.48s]  Do you know where the heart of Edward is?
[1264.48s -> 1274.28s]  He laughs again.
[1274.28s -> 1276.28s]  Of course I do.
[1276.28s -> 1278.28s]  It's right here in my pocket.
[1278.28s -> 1280.28s]  But before you can grab it, he vanishes.
[1280.28s -> 1282.71s]  You're standing near a dead tree.
[1282.71s -> 1292.44s]  There's a large hole in the ground nearby and a wooden stake sticking out of the ground.
[1292.44s -> 1293.44s]  I shouldn't have said that.
[1293.44s -> 1300.09s]  Lie down in the hole.
[1300.09s -> 1303.87s]  On my back.
[1303.87s -> 1311.68s]  A moment later, you hear a strange sound coming from below you.
[1311.68s -> 1314.68s]  As you look down, you see the old man sitting on the ground, smiling at you.
[1314.68s -> 1316.68s]  Hello there, he says.
[1316.68s -> 1322.82s]  Wait, am I on top of him?
[1322.82s -> 1331.72s]  He's lying down on the ground too?
[1331.72s -> 1334.72s]  Wildcard, type only a question mark to ask and wonder.
[1334.72s -> 1335.72s]  Okay, that's...
[1335.72s -> 1337.79s]  Where did you go?
[1337.79s -> 1340.41s]  How did you disappear so quickly?
[1340.41s -> 1343.41s]  Oh, that was just a little trick I learned when I was young.
[1343.41s -> 1347.68s]  I can disappear and appear at will.
[1347.68s -> 1354.87s]  Can you teach me, old man?
[1354.87s -> 1355.87s]  Sure, he says.
[1355.87s -> 1358.43s]  Come on down and we'll have some fun.
[1358.43s -> 1361.43s]  You descend into the hole, which seems to be a small cave.
[1361.43s -> 1366.42s]  The old man follows you in.
[1366.42s -> 1374.57s]  I gotta be very cautious.
[1374.57s -> 1387.63s]  Keep my hands on my knife, on my sword, while we walk into the cave.
[1387.63s -> 1391.63s]  As soon as you enter the cave, the old man grabs his pocket watch and starts ticking loudly.
[1391.63s -> 1394.87s]  Suddenly a huge creature bursts...
[1394.87s -> 1397.87s]  Suddenly a huge creature bursts out of the ground behind you.
[1397.87s -> 1399.87s]  It looks like a cross between a bull and a bear.
[1399.87s -> 1405.91s]  Watch out!
[1405.91s -> 1409.17s]  It turns around and sees the old man.
[1409.17s -> 1412.48s]  It snarls and charges at him.
[1412.48s -> 1420.53s]  The old man jumps out of the way just in time and the creature falls on its side, stunned.
[1420.53s -> 1422.60s]  Kill it!
[1422.60s -> 1425.60s]  You leap forward and swing your sword at the beast, cutting off one of its legs.
[1425.60s -> 1427.60s]  It howls in pain and lunges at you.
[1427.60s -> 1431.78s]  You dodge the attack and stab it in the eye with your sword.
[1431.78s -> 1445.37s]  Old man!
[1445.37s -> 1447.68s]  Grab me the holy water from my backpack!
[1447.68s -> 1452.49s]  You run back towards the old man who is still holding the pocket watch in his hand.
[1452.49s -> 1454.49s]  He takes it out of his pocket and flicks it open.
[1454.49s -> 1457.80s]  Suddenly he screams and drops the watch.
[1457.80s -> 1464.20s]  Pick up the watch.
[1464.20s -> 1467.59s]  You pick up the watch.
[1467.59s -> 1471.59s]  The watch is cracked and covered in dirt, but inside you can see a tiny fragment of white bone.
[1471.59s -> 1475.76s]  You take the watch out of the pocket and put it back in your bag.
[1475.76s -> 1481.56s]  What does this watch do?
[1481.56s -> 1485.72s]  Nothing special, the old man says.
[1485.72s -> 1486.72s]  Just a good luck charm.
[1487.72s -> 1489.72s]  You leave the cave and head deeper into the woods.
[1489.72s -> 1492.72s]  You are now in the clearing where you found the relic.
[1492.72s -> 1496.20s]  Okay.
[1496.20s -> 1501.45s]  Why did he scream?
[1501.45s -> 1511.28s]  Why did you scream after opening the pocket of the watch?
[1511.28s -> 1516.83s]  Oh, that's just something that happens sometimes, the old man says.
[1516.83s -> 1517.83s]  It's not important.
[1517.83s -> 1519.83s]  Just don't open it again, okay?
[1519.83s -> 1527.66s]  You are standing in a clearing to the west of the small hill.
[1527.66s -> 1533.63s]  If I open this pocket watch, what will happen?
[1533.63s -> 1539.13s]  Don't open it again.
[1539.13s -> 1542.13s]  And make sure you never tell anybody about this place.
[1542.13s -> 1545.13s]  You reach into your bag and pull out a small metal box.
[1545.13s -> 1547.13s]  It is engraved with strange symbols.
[1547.13s -> 1554.32s]  Open the pocket watch.
[1554.32s -> 1557.59s]  Suddenly the old man disappears.
[1557.59s -> 1560.59s]  You feel yourself falling through the air and then everything goes black.
[1560.59s -> 1564.66s]  You are lying on the ground with the old man kneeling beside you.
[1564.66s -> 1566.90s]  He's holding a flask of water.
[1566.90s -> 1573.39s]  Where are we?
[1573.39s -> 1579.02s]  We're in the forest, he replies.
[1579.02s -> 1583.02s]  I had to bring you here because I couldn't find any other way to contact you.
[1583.02s -> 1585.65s]  Why?
[1585.65s -> 1598.06s]  Because if anyone else finds out about this place, they might try to come here.
[1598.06s -> 1599.06s]  How nice is it?
[1599.06s -> 1600.06s]  It's a time machine.
[1600.06s -> 1607.11s]  What year is it?
[1607.11s -> 1610.11s]  It's 1827, he replies.
[1610.11s -> 1612.67s]  How long have I been unconscious?
[1612.67s -> 1613.67s]  About two weeks.
[1613.67s -> 1615.48s]  You sit up.
[1615.48s -> 1616.48s]  Thank you for saving me, old man.
[1616.48s -> 1624.53s]  Open the pocket watch.
[1624.53s -> 1625.53s]  This might be the relic.
[1625.53s -> 1626.53s]  This is the relic.
[1626.53s -> 1631.08s]  The old man screams and drops the watch.
[1631.08s -> 1633.08s]  You open the watch and see a piece of white bone.
[1633.08s -> 1637.77s]  You close the watch and put it back in your bag.
[1637.77s -> 1649.55s]  You stand up and walk over to the old man.
[1649.55s -> 1650.55s]  Am I in the cave?
[1650.55s -> 1659.79s]  Is that the relic?
[1659.79s -> 1661.80s]  Yes, he says.
[1661.80s -> 1663.80s]  That is the relic.
[1663.80s -> 1667.38s]  You take the relic from him and put it in your bag.
[1667.38s -> 1668.38s]  Now let's get out of here.
[1668.38s -> 1674.38s]  So that's the heart of Edward's heart.
[1674.38s -> 1675.38s]  That's the heart of Edward.
[1675.38s -> 1680.84s]  They leave it.
[1680.84s -> 1684.50s]  Heart?
[1684.50s -> 1688.94s]  Edward is in my hands.
[1688.94s -> 1691.63s]  Father will be most pleased.
[1691.63s -> 1701.76s]  No!
[1701.76s -> 1702.76s]  The old man shouts.
[1702.76s -> 1703.76s]  This is evil.
[1703.76s -> 1705.52s]  We must destroy it.
[1705.52s -> 1706.52s]  But why?
[1706.52s -> 1708.52s]  I've been searching for this for years.
[1708.52s -> 1709.52s]  Because it's evil.
[1709.52s -> 1713.29s]  What makes it evil?
[1713.29s -> 1717.84s]  It's cursed.
[1717.84s -> 1718.84s]  He replies.
[1718.84s -> 1721.84s]  If you open it, it will take away all of your memories.
[1721.84s -> 1723.84s]  And then you won't remember anything.
[1723.84s -> 1725.84s]  You hold the relic in both hands.
[1725.84s -> 1738.60s]  Open it.
[1738.60s -> 1742.69s]  Suddenly you are standing in a dark room.
[1742.69s -> 1744.69s]  You are holding a glowing blue orb.
[1744.69s -> 1748.69s]  You look around the room and notice that the walls are covered in strange writing.
[1748.69s -> 1749.69s]  You read.
[1749.69s -> 1756.38s]  The first man, Adam, created in the image of God, was alone in the Garden of Eden.
[1756.38s -> 1761.46s]  Keep reading.
[1761.46s -> 1773.33s]  Until Eve, the second woman, was brought forth from his rib, Adam gave her to his son Cain.
[1773.33s -> 1776.33s]  Adam gave her to his son Cain as a wife?
[1776.33s -> 1779.33s]  Cain slew his brother Abel and fled from the Garden of Eden.
[1779.33s -> 1790.91s]  Then Enoch, the third man, walked with God and was taken up to heaven without dying.
[1790.91s -> 1795.08s]  Enoch returned to earth and told his people that the world would end.
[1795.08s -> 1804.80s]  After many years, the Great Flood destroyed the world and Noah built an ark to save his
[1804.80s -> 1806.80s]  family from the waters.
[1806.80s -> 1810.80s]  The ark floated for 40 days and nights until it reached dry land.
[1810.80s -> 1812.17s]  Keep reading.
[1812.17s -> 1817.50s]  The ark landed on Mount Ararat in Turkey.
[1817.50s -> 1821.50s]  God commanded Noah to build a tower to reach heaven.
[1821.50s -> 1828.50s]  Noah obeyed and constructed the Tower of Babel, the first human structure ever made.
[1828.50s -> 1834.45s]  Is this all real?
[1834.45s -> 1836.45s]  Does this happen?
[1836.45s -> 1837.95s]  Keep reading.
[1837.95s -> 1848.90s]  But Satan, the god of this world, the hunters, were becoming too powerful and tried to destroy
[1848.90s -> 1849.90s]  them.
[1849.90s -> 1853.90s]  So he caused them to speak different languages, and they began to fight amongst themselves.
[1853.90s -> 1860.21s]  Keep reading.
[1860.21s -> 1864.21s]  God scattered the humans and scattered their language.
[1864.21s -> 1869.21s]  When Moses led the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt, he was given the Ten Commandments.
[1869.21s -> 1880.16s]  Moses returned to Israel and built the Tabernacle, the first temple in Jerusalem.
[1880.16s -> 1886.51s]  King Solomon built the first temple, and the Ark of the Covenant was placed in it.
[1886.51s -> 1891.51s]  Solomon also built the second temple, which stood until the Romans destroyed it in 70a.
[1891.51s -> 1905.05s]  I wonder where Satan was at this point.
[1905.05s -> 1913.39s]  Satan was banished from heaven and cast down to hell.
[1913.39s -> 1918.39s]  In the last days, Satan will return to earth, and the Antichrist will reign over the world.
[1918.39s -> 1922.40s]  The Bible is a book of prophecy.
[1922.40s -> 1926.71s]  Keep reading.
[1926.71s -> 1929.71s]  The Antichrist will be a false prophet who will rise to power in the Middle East.
[1929.71s -> 1932.71s]  His name is Muhammad, and he will rule the world.
[1932.71s -> 1936.71s]  At the end of his reign, Jesus Christ will return to earth and defeat the Antichrist.
[1936.71s -> 1937.71s]  What?
[1937.71s -> 1940.01s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[1940.01s -> 1944.52s]  What?
[1944.52s -> 1952.53s]  Jesus will establish his kingdom on earth and rule as king of kings for a thousand years.
[1952.53s -> 1955.53s]  After that, Satan will be released from prison and tempt...
[1955.53s -> 1957.53s]  What is happening here?
[1957.53s -> 1966.66s]  Say, this doesn't sound accurate.
[1966.66s -> 1971.33s]  It is true that the Antichrist will rise.
[1971.33s -> 1973.33s]  He will be defeated by Jesus.
[1973.33s -> 1976.33s]  Also, the Antichrist will not be the only false prophet.
[1976.33s -> 1977.33s]  There will be others.
[1977.33s -> 1982.40s]  I don't think this is what happened.
[1982.40s -> 1986.56s]  Who is talking right now?
[1986.56s -> 1993.73s]  It's me, the old man says.
[1993.73s -> 1995.73s]  I'm telling you what happened.
[1995.73s -> 1997.91s]  You continue reading.
[1997.91s -> 2007.29s]  Aren't I reading this off of a wall?
[2007.29s -> 2014.04s]  After the a thousand years are up, Satan will be released from his prison and will deceive mankind once more.
[2014.04s -> 2025.16s]  Keep reading.
[2025.16s -> 2029.75s]  No, I don't want him to keep reading.
[2029.75s -> 2032.75s]  I'm telling him to keep reading.
[2032.75s -> 2034.75s]  Hey, I'll go. Keep reading.
[2034.75s -> 2038.99s]  This time, he will be able to use the powers of a fallen angel called the Beast.
[2038.99s -> 2042.99s]  The Beast will rule the world for seven years before being defeated by Jesus.
[2042.99s -> 2051.13s]  When Satan is imprisoned again, the devil will be chained for a thousand years.
[2051.13s -> 2052.13s]  Is Thor in this?
[2052.13s -> 2054.44s]  Yes, the old man says.
[2054.44s -> 2057.44s]  He is mentioned several times in the Bible.
[2057.44s -> 2059.44s]  You continue reading.
[2059.44s -> 2066.74s]  At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed once more and will tempt mankind to rebel against God.
[2066.74s -> 2070.74s]  Can you skip to the part with Elmo?
[2070.74s -> 2077.50s]  No, the old man says. There isn't much left.
[2077.50s -> 2081.93s]  During the rebellion, the Antichrist will be killed by the archangel Michael.
[2081.93s -> 2087.30s]  Michael will be rewarded for his bravery and become the leader of the angels.
[2087.30s -> 2090.48s]  Is Elmo in this?
[2090.48s -> 2097.34s]  No, the old man says. He does not appear in the Bible at all.
[2097.34s -> 2099.34s]  Oh, okay. Phew.
[2099.34s -> 2107.70s]  Elmo is not in the Bible.
[2107.70s -> 2109.70s]  What about Kermit the Frog?
[2109.70s -> 2115.76s]  Kermit the Frog is not mentioned in the Bible.
[2115.76s -> 2117.76s]  You continue reading.
[2117.76s -> 2128.45s]  Okay, please, please finish the story.
[2128.45s -> 2131.45s]  After that, Satan will be chained for a thousand years.
[2131.45s -> 2132.45s]  Alright, he's stuck.
[2132.45s -> 2137.65s]  Grab the book out of his hands.
[2137.65s -> 2142.81s]  I am finished, the old man says. You can stop reading now.
[2142.81s -> 2145.99s]  You take the book out of his hands and put it back in your bag.
[2145.99s -> 2147.99s]  Wait, what about Elmo?
[2147.99s -> 2163.58s]  You're now standing in the clearing where you found the relic.
[2163.58s -> 2166.82s]  You're standing in the clearing where you found the relic. To the west is a small hill.
[2166.82s -> 2170.82s]  To the east is a path leading north into the forest.
[2170.82s -> 2185.04s]  Okay.
[2185.04s -> 2187.04s]  Yell, where is Elmo?
[2187.04s -> 2188.66s]  My god.
[2188.66s -> 2193.08s]  You shout, where is Elmo?
[2193.08s -> 2196.08s]  Suddenly, the old man appears.
[2196.08s -> 2198.08s]  Where is Elmo, you ask?
[2198.08s -> 2200.08s]  He's gone. I sent him away.
[2200.08s -> 2203.08s]  You reach into your bag and pull out the pocket watch.
[2203.08s -> 2212.84s]  Fuck this Elmo-less timeline.
[2212.84s -> 2218.54s]  I'm out of here.
[2218.54s -> 2221.54s]  Suddenly, you're standing in a dark room. You're holding a glowing blue orb.
[2221.54s -> 2224.72s]  You look around the room and notice that the walls are covered in strange writing.
[2224.72s -> 2225.72s]  You read.
[2225.72s -> 2229.89s]  The first man, Adam, created in the image of God, was alone in the Garden of Eden.
[2229.89s -> 2236.44s]  Read the part about Elmo.
[2236.44s -> 2241.34s]  Until Eve. Come on.
[2241.34s -> 2245.64s]  You can't give me like, Elmo is like Eve or something.
[2245.64s -> 2247.64s]  The book of Elmo.
[2247.64s -> 2253.11s]  Run out of the cave.
[2253.11s -> 2255.35s]  You run out of the cave.
[2255.35s -> 2257.35s]  You're now standing in the clearing where you found the relic.
[2257.35s -> 2258.72s]  To the west is a small hill.
[2258.72s -> 2261.72s]  Head towards the hill.
[2261.72s -> 2266.88s]  You climb the hill and are standing at the top.
[2266.88s -> 2269.88s]  To the north is a path leading south into the forest.
[2269.88s -> 2277.92s]  To the east is a path leading south into the forest.
[2277.92s -> 2280.92s]  To the east is a path leading north into the forest.
[2280.92s -> 2284.92s]  And to the west is a path leading north into the forest.
[2284.92s -> 2288.88s]  Ask the old man where to go.
[2288.88s -> 2296.96s]  We need to find the relic. It is buried under the hill.
[2296.96s -> 2299.65s]  You ask the old man where to go.
[2299.65s -> 2303.11s]  We need to find the relic.
[2303.11s -> 2304.11s]  We've time traveled.
[2304.11s -> 2307.82s]  Explain to the old man.
[2307.82s -> 2311.24s]  How do I say this?
[2311.24s -> 2319.21s]  Explain to the old man. You explain to the old man time travel.
[2319.21s -> 2322.28s]  Time travel is impossible, he says.
[2322.28s -> 2324.28s]  Only God can do that.
[2324.28s -> 2336.11s]  That makes me God then.
[2336.11s -> 2337.11s]  That makes you God?
[2337.11s -> 2342.06s]  You ask the old man where to go.
[2342.06s -> 2345.06s]  We need to find the relic. It's buried under the hill.
[2345.06s -> 2347.36s]  That makes me God then, you reply.
[2347.36s -> 2352.06s]  Why?
[2352.06s -> 2358.44s]  Because I am the one who sent you back in time, he says.
[2358.44s -> 2361.54s]  We need to find the relic.
[2361.54s -> 2369.37s]  We're combining like three or four realities.
[2369.37s -> 2372.61s]  Dig under the hill for the relic.
[2372.61s -> 2374.61s]  Are we gonna find two of them?
[2374.61s -> 2377.75s]  You dig under the hill for the relic.
[2377.75s -> 2378.99s]  We need to find the relic.
[2378.99s -> 2380.23s]  Find the relic.
[2380.23s -> 2381.23s]  We're in a loop.
[2381.23s -> 2383.23s]  You find the relic.
[2383.23s -> 2386.17s]  We need to find the relic.
[2386.17s -> 2387.17s]  We need to find the relic.
[2387.17s -> 2391.08s]  Start shaking the old man.
[2391.08s -> 2394.21s]  You start shaking the old man.
[2394.21s -> 2396.90s]  We need to find the relic!
[2413.37s -> 2416.24s]  Break, smash the relic.
[2416.24s -> 2436.06s]  You smashed the relic with a hammer.
[2436.06s -> 2458.65s]  slap him it's over we're stuck in an infinite loop now the old man snaps out of it both venture
[2459.21s -> 2478.81s]  to the small hill where the relic is buried will that fix it wait do a new story about elmo okay
[2478.81s -> 2524.48s]  all right that was fun new story you were the old man the whole time an old cartoon
[2525.44s -> 2531.61s]  actor made popular by sesame street oh we're not an old character friend

[2653.16s -> 2657.48s]  a huge metal box sits on the floor of the room it looks like it might be heavy enough to crush
[2657.48s -> 2669.95s]  you if you were foolish enough to try lifting it okay i think i'm gonna just head down the tunnel
[2673.02s -> 2683.28s]  lift the lift the box lift the box it's too heavy for you to lift you'll need at least two people
[2683.28s -> 2689.39s]  to move this thing it's too heavy you hear a noise from the north any two people are gonna find a
[2689.39s -> 2704.11s]  party member ed north you're standing near the exit to the end of the world tunnel michael is

[2717.60s -> 2724.17s]  here i was hoping we could talk about what happened last night i know it's probably hard
[2724.17s -> 2729.32s]  to remember everything that happened yeah sure whatever okay well maybe you could tell me how
[2729.32s -> 2755.93s]  you got home last night uh michael the important thing is tracking down elmo he's here somewhere

[2810.25s -> 2813.85s]  all right you mike continues writing this book you turn michael stops you again
[2815.36s -> 2824.36s]  stop stop moving i don't understand why you're so worried about this elmo guy we've only known
[2824.36s -> 2829.90s]  each other for a couple of weeks why do you care so much well i don't really know him personally
[2829.90s -> 2841.87s]  but my parents always talked about him when i was growing up he was always teaching us things
[2842.59s -> 2861.93s]  not to count out to eat right he always seemed like a pretty stand-up guy yeah i guess that's true
[2862.89s -> 2872.38s]  so what's this all about are you gonna help me find him or not i'm sorry mikey but i'm afraid i
[2872.38s -> 2879.42s]  can't help you why not because i think it will be dangerous to go looking for elmo dangerous what
[2879.42s -> 2891.48s]  are you you talking about dangerous i mean any more context or what did he teach you he taught
[2891.48s -> 2894.36s]  me a lot of things but i didn't really pay attention to most and telling me how to count
[2894.36s -> 2911.21s]  and how to read why is it dangerous to look for elmo i'm afraid i'm afraid he might be dangerous
[2912.01s -> 2919.56s]  what makes you think that he's a monster what kind of monster i don't know i guess i never paid
[2919.56s -> 2935.52s]  attention to what he looked like what do you think he looks like shit retry uh undo redo redo
[2935.52s -> 2950.17s]  redo no no no undo undo okay what does he look like i got it something stupid's gonna happen
[2950.99s -> 2958.04s]  i don't know something big like a bear but he doesn't have claws or fangs does he no i don't
[2958.04s -> 2969.95s]  think so and why are you so scared he can't hurt you i know but still i don't feel safe around him
[2972.83s -> 2978.19s]  i don't know michael please i need your help if we can find elmo we can bring him to justice
[2982.75s -> 2993.10s]  what did he do nothing really i mean he taught me stuff but he wasn't really a bad guy i don't
[2993.10s -> 3004.83s]  know why he left did he ever threaten you no what makes elmo dangerous i don't know i'm just scared
[3005.47s -> 3009.84s]  you're being silly michael you shouldn't let something like this scare you i know i'm sorry
[3009.84s -> 3017.50s]  i just don't feel comfortable with the whole thing play in editor mode it's less likely to get stuck

[4845.32s -> 4851.24s]  it i'll be fine i just think i need to rest for a bit i helped him into his house and once inside i
[4851.24s -> 4862.51s]  saw that he had blood all over him i asked him if he needed help getting cleaned up but he told me
[4862.51s -> 4868.28s]  to go ahead and leave so i went back outside and called 911 when the police arrived they took him
[4868.28s -> 4879.82s]  away how did i kill someone about two weeks later i was called in to meet with my boss
[4880.62s -> 4887.34s]  i was told that he was going to fire me for causing him to lose his job i protested telling him i
[4887.34s -> 4905.28s]  didn't do anything wrong but he wouldn't listen i told him i told him he wouldn't listen he kept
[4905.28s -> 4924.57s]  shouting blood i'm shouting the blood and pointing at me finally i gave up and accepted my fate
[4924.57s -> 4928.14s]  a few days later i got a letter from mr fitz thanking me for helping him he said that he was
[4928.14s -> 4931.58s]  grateful for my assistance and he was going to give me a raise and a promotion
[4938.73s -> 4949.34s]  i said thank you but could not understand what no i said i said let me see how do i get this i said
[4949.34s -> 4956.67s]  thank you but he defined the relic the same development he said where does the killing come
[4956.67s -> 4976.43s]  in i declined and decided quit on the spot when i told my neighbor mr fitz he told me that i was
[4976.43s -> 4980.35s]  crazy for losing such a great job and that i should have done everything i could to save it
[4980.91s -> 4985.37s]  but i knew that i couldn't risk losing my job because if there's something i did accidentally
[4986.52s -> 4997.08s]  so here i am unemployed and eating toast mr fitz walks into the midnight sun and i see him sitting
[4997.08s -> 5013.37s]  at a table wait this is like are we going back to this moment or something i approach to shake his
[5013.37s -> 5021.34s]  hand and greet him but he doesn't respond mr fitz are you okay he turns to me and says i'm fine are

[5080.56s -> 5091.40s]  a waitress a cook and a busboy i think because i'm too embarrassed i think it was the cook
[5092.04s -> 5116.30s]  i think it was the cook he has been making pizza back there where is he now i don't know he ran
[5116.30s -> 5121.42s]  off when he started yelling find him now sir i don't think he should yell at us like that

[6627.47s -> 6635.63s]  and wait for the investor to finish talking to someone on the phone he hangs up very upset
[6636.11s -> 6653.84s]  it seems the investors do not think vampire chef vr will sell more than
[6654.48s -> 6667.60s]  eight copies i'm sorry but i don't think we should invest any money into this project
[6668.32s -> 6683.32s]  why not that's too risky what do you mean pulls out a graph resident sleeper this is a chart of
[6683.32s -> 6690.52s]  all the games that have sold for over one million copies so see vampire chef vr has only sold
[6690.52s -> 6709.74s]  7500 copies that is not enough for us to invest any more than we already have 7500 copies that's
[6709.74s -> 6714.46s]  it yes that's all i look at the graph and notice that all the other games on the list have sold
[6714.46s -> 6728.19s]  hundreds of thousands of copies why well it's simple most people don't like vampires and
[6728.19s -> 6737.92s]  fact i bet most of those who bought the game are children children but i'm 14 years old wait what
[6741.21s -> 6747.53s]  14 year olds don't buy games they play them on their phones and computers i don't understand
[6747.53s -> 6761.93s]  i'm sorry but you don't have the right demographic what if we made it a mobile game took out the
[6761.93s -> 6773.50s]  blood and replaced it with a match three match three game where you periodically
[6774.46s -> 6797.24s]  clean up a house or a garden with points from the match three game we could lose the vr experience
[6798.12s -> 6810.68s]  what if we kept the vr experience but made it a different game a different game you know but
[6810.68s -> 6816.25s]  that wouldn't be a vr game yes it would you would still be using vr you would just be playing on a
[6816.25s -> 6838.09s]  different screen i don't know you could hold up two copies of the game in front of each eye it's
[6838.09s -> 6851.02s]  the same no it isn't yes it is no it isn't yes it is no it's not yes it is i don't know i just
[6851.02s -> 6854.22s]  don't think it would work well we'll see if you're interested give me a call tomorrow morning all
[6854.22s -> 6871.88s]  right thanks lunch forward and bite his neck he falls to the floor and i take his heart and throw
[6871.88s -> 6877.48s]  it into the trash can i take a deep breath and then exhale i turn around and see the investor
[6877.48s -> 6891.85s]  staring at me who did i do this to who did i do that too i just saw you bite his neck and then
[6891.85s -> 6896.54s]  take his heart out of his chest oh i was just showing him what happens when you don't listen
[6896.54s -> 6908.78s]  to me i leave the office head home and walk into my apartment and sit down on the couch
[6908.78s -> 6912.46s]  i look at my computer and realize i need to do some work i take out my laptop and plug it into
[6912.46s -> 6924.17s]  the wall i bite the computer's neck and pull out its brain i put the brain into a jar and then put
[6924.17s -> 6931.37s]  it in my fridge what are you doing i'm working i put the computer into a vr headset and i begin
[6931.37s -> 6945.16s]  to work all right i'm going off the rails yeah this one's over it's an email from an investor

[7031.07s -> 7041.68s]  prestigious chefs in some of the most prestigious chefs act as judges and contestants are eliminated
[7045.05s -> 7056.65s]  based on the quality of their cooking let's go it's a high stakes competition with some pretty
[7056.65s -> 7060.97s]  amazing prizes i'm not sure how it works but they say it's like a reality tv show where you get to
[7060.97s -> 7065.21s]  be the star the show airs on one of those channels that my parents never let me watch when i was
[7065.21s -> 7073.95s]  growing up why but now i have access to all kinds of great shows and i can't wait for them to air
[7073.95s -> 7077.15s]  so i can tell everyone about them i've been watching a lot of different shows and getting
[7077.15s -> 7091.20s]  ideas from them both back i enter the arena and see a dozen chefs all standing with their arms
[7091.76s -> 7104.75s]  behind their backs and wearing the same branded aprons there are cameras everywhere and a few
[7104.75s -> 7109.47s]  people who look like production assistants stand nearby i'm feeling very nervous but also excited
[7109.47s -> 7113.87s]  this could be my chance to become famous i walk into the kitchen and immediately fall feel out
[7113.87s -> 7121.24s]  of place i bite their necks okay i walk in the kitchen immediately but i place
[7122.28s -> 7156.64s]  suddenly chef suddenly chef greg rampson walks in in front of me he looks at me and says ah you're
[7156.64s -> 7160.64s]  one of our mystery contestants i have no idea what he means so i ask him what he's talking about he
[7160.64s -> 7172.84s]  smiles and tells me to follow him you're one of our mystery contestants follow chef rampson
[7173.48s -> 7179.56s]  into i follow chef rampson let's see where are we going which turns out to be a changing room
[7179.56s -> 7182.84s]  there are a bunch of other chefs waiting there too they all seem to know each other and some
[7182.84s -> 7185.80s]  even seem to be friends so it's like what like a green room like what do you mean change what do
[7185.80s -> 7193.64s]  you mean changing room why is it usually there's like a green room where everybody hangs out
[7193.64s -> 7214.44s]  why are we all hanging on a changing room sit down at one of the tables and try to relax it's my big
[7214.44s -> 7229.66s]  day i need to prove that i'm the best chef here relax chef rampson comes back into the room and
[7229.66s -> 7233.58s]  tells us that we'll be starting soon we all put on our aprons and head back into the kitchen
[7234.14s -> 7245.60s]  kitchen has two huge burners a grill a fryer a steamer a wok a cutting board and an oven it's
[7245.60s -> 7248.64s]  a lot bigger than i expected it looks like the kind of kitchen you would find in a restaurant
[7249.20s -> 7252.24s]  i start to wonder if this is really going to be a game show or something else entirely
[7252.88s -> 7269.04s]  rampson approaches rampson approaches us and a big timer shows on a billboard behind him
[7270.33s -> 7281.60s]  it is a countdown for the start of the show it's my turn with the cutting board
[7281.60s -> 7298.62s]  oh shit on a okay here we go the chefs take their seats and the hostess starts introducing everyone
[7299.18s -> 7303.82s]  she introduces me as a contestant from the united states and goes over some rules of the show
[7303.90s -> 7311.61s]  then she introduces chef greg rampson who will be acting as a judge i wanted to explain the rules
[7313.29s -> 7321.69s]  the rules are explained as right the rules are explained as well and i realize that i've been
[7321.69s -> 7326.17s]  given a great advantage by being able to cook without using any of these tools i can just use
[7326.17s -> 7343.69s]  my hands to make food what the rules are explained as follows each round will last five minutes and
[7343.77s -> 7348.81s]  each chef gets one minute to cook if a chef runs out of time before they finish cooking they lose
[7349.37s -> 7354.89s]  it will be two rounds per episode with four chefs competing in each round one minute to make food
[7358.88s -> 7364.08s]  okay in the first round chefs will prepare a dish using ingredients provided by the producers
[7364.72s -> 7367.68s]  in the second round chefs will create a dish using whatever ingredients they want
[7368.40s -> 7372.00s]  once a chef is finished cooking they will give their dish to the judges and wait to hear their
[7372.00s -> 7384.19s]  scores okay the first round is about to begin i get to work immediately because i know that i
[7384.19s -> 7389.39s]  don't have much time i make my way to the oven and set it to 400 degrees i add a little olive
