[2.55s -> 6.65s]  I-I'm on time. We're waiting pa- I'm on time. I'm here.
[6.65s -> 12.92s]  I pressed the button at 2 o'clock.
[12.92s -> 18.41s]  It took an extra 45 seconds to get through the internet tubes, okay?
[18.41s -> 24.06s]  You understand the remarkable tech no- my throat is all screwed up.
[24.06s -> 25.46s]  Come with me, I'll just wait here.
[27.70s -> 29.46s]  Well, my nose is.
[29.46s -> 33.94s]  Gotta figure out what's going on inside the, uh, inside the nasal passages here.
[33.94s -> 37.94s]  Some of you know, I've had some nasal problems over the last 6 months or so.
[37.94s -> 39.34s]  Last few months at least.
[40.62s -> 42.62s]  It's got- I just went to the doctor recently.
[42.62s -> 43.22s]  Again.
[44.02s -> 46.19s]  Probably why my nose is irritated.
[46.79s -> 51.90s]  I've got these annoying things that I have to deal with.
[52.30s -> 54.50s]  And it's stupid.
[55.10s -> 56.30s]  It's stupid.
[56.90s -> 58.58s]  Anyways, how you doin'?
[58.98s -> 59.78s]  He's drunk.
[59.78s -> 60.58s]  Ha ha ha!
[60.58s -> 63.18s]  Ah, by the way, I drank a fuckin' pint!
[63.78s -> 68.57s]  This guy's- it's too much cocaine.
[71.07s -> 71.67s]  No.
[71.67s -> 78.38s]  I've- I've- this- no.
[78.38s -> 79.18s]  God.
[79.18s -> 82.33s]  Alright, let me tweet- we're gonna do some tier lists today.
[83.13s -> 87.37s]  And some browser, uh, just stuff.
[88.78s -> 90.78s]  We're gonna do- we're gonna- essentially what we're doing today.
[91.38s -> 92.98s]  Is it- you know what? I'll tell you in a minute.
[92.98s -> 94.58s]  I'll tell you in like a minute or two.
[94.58s -> 95.78s]  Let me tweet this and I'll be right back.
[156.14s -> 157.14s]  It's a boring title.
[158.89s -> 162.09s]  But what- what do you want me to have the title- you know, what are- what should the title be?
[164.16s -> 169.93s]  My titles tell you precisely what is going to happen on this stream.
[171.22s -> 174.02s]  It's just quick, it's to the point that you- you know what you're gonna get, right?
[177.75s -> 178.35s]  Facecam?
[178.35s -> 180.55s]  Uh, I- I don't know.
[180.55s -> 181.55s]  I don't know about today.
[182.15s -> 183.55s]  I think of course there's gonna be a facecam.
[184.52s -> 185.92s]  Stop asking for it!
[186.32s -> 187.52s]  Stop asking for it!
[190.41s -> 194.01s]  Sorry, I got- I just got a little upset about that one.
[197.28s -> 198.68s]  I've- I've been in another mood today.
[198.68s -> 199.88s]  This is gonna be a weird stream.
[205.52s -> 206.92s]  I'm already in a-
[208.22s -> 212.58s]  This is two streams in a row where I'm just in one of those moods.
[217.06s -> 219.26s]  Remember, did you strangle somebody behind a dumpster or two- no.
[221.26s -> 222.86s]  Why would I ever, like, say yes?
[226.58s -> 228.78s]  What kind of question- why would I ever say yes to that question?
[229.38s -> 235.54s]  Nobody asked that.
[241.44s -> 242.44s]  Do I like art?
[244.88s -> 246.48s]  Yeah, of course I do.
[250.46s -> 251.26s]  All right, you guys ready?
[251.86s -> 256.79s]  Are you ready?
[259.61s -> 260.01s]  Hi.
[261.92s -> 265.29s]  So, as you see here- it's kind of dark in here, isn't it?
[265.69s -> 267.81s]  Whatever.
[268.38s -> 268.98s]  It's too big.
[275.19s -> 280.19s]  Okay, so, I have to update my fast food tier list.
[280.79s -> 281.79s]  Some of these are updates.
[284.87s -> 288.67s]  I've eaten at a lot more of these places, but actually there's still a lot that I have not.
[289.27s -> 290.47s]  And pardon my voice.
[291.27s -> 292.47s]  Every so often it's gonna go-
[294.27s -> 296.67s]  With sounds and words coming out and I'm gonna have to go-
[297.87s -> 299.69s]  Apologize for that.
[300.90s -> 301.70s]  You got a haircut?
[303.86s -> 305.26s]  When was the last time you guys saw me on camera?
[305.46s -> 312.99s]  How long has it been since I've been on camera?
[314.72s -> 315.32s]  Couple weeks?
[316.09s -> 316.89s]  No, I don't think so.
[317.49s -> 318.09s]  Smoker?
[318.49s -> 320.29s]  I don't smoke cigarettes.
[320.29s -> 321.29s]  I don't smoke anything.
[324.74s -> 325.94s]  I need to make it a little-
[327.22s -> 327.82s]  Hold on.
[332.36s -> 334.16s]  Needs to be- the brightness has to come up a little bit.
[334.56s -> 335.90s]  Right?
[337.12s -> 337.52s]  Yeah.
[339.00s -> 339.60s]  Yeah, it does.
[343.14s -> 343.94s]  You look drunk.
[345.10s -> 346.10s]  I don't look drunk.
[346.80s -> 348.60s]  I don't look drunk.
[352.89s -> 353.89s]  Dude, are you drunk?
[354.29s -> 355.29s]  I'm not drunk!
[358.87s -> 360.07s]  Okay, I want like brightness.
[368.26s -> 368.86s]  That's better.
[368.86s -> 369.86s]  Well, that's kind of weird.
[369.86s -> 371.06s]  It looks like pixelated, doesn't it?
[376.33s -> 376.73s]  Is it better?
[376.93s -> 380.54s]  That's a little better, right?
[382.72s -> 384.12s]  Okay, I think that's okay for now.
[390.65s -> 392.65s]  Okay, I'm done stalling.
[393.05s -> 398.08s]  Don't worry, I'm high too.
[398.28s -> 399.28s]  I'm not high.
[405.30s -> 406.90s]  Put the contrast down or up?
[412.73s -> 413.93s]  Okay, we're gonna start.
[413.93s -> 415.73s]  I'm gonna update some tier lists.
[416.10s -> 416.90s]  Hi, everybody.
[416.90s -> 417.90s]  Welcome back.
[417.90s -> 419.10s]  Be entertaining.
[419.30s -> 423.39s]  That curtain hadn't even gone up yet!
[423.79s -> 424.79s]  This is relaxed!
[425.19s -> 426.39s]  I can stop screaming at you.
[429.66s -> 430.66s]  All right, A&W.
[431.06s -> 431.86s]  We're gonna start here.
[432.06s -> 434.19s]  A&W.
[436.42s -> 438.02s]  I'd like- I like the root beer,
[438.60s -> 441.60s]  but I've never eaten at an A&W restaurant before.
[449.74s -> 450.74s]  Do they even exist?
[452.66s -> 454.26s]  Is A&W like Blockbuster?
[454.46s -> 456.06s]  Like this one left somewhere?
[456.26s -> 457.26s]  Like in the middle of like,
[457.66s -> 459.06s]  Ohio or something somewhere?
[459.46s -> 460.06s]  Where is it?
[461.34s -> 461.94s]  I've never heard of this.
[463.74s -> 464.94s]  It's in Canada.
[467.10s -> 468.30s]  I think it just woke up.
[468.70s -> 470.30s]  I did not just wake up.
[470.50s -> 471.50s]  I know I ha- look.
[471.70s -> 474.46s]  Excuse me.
[474.90s -> 476.30s]  I need to tell you this.
[476.50s -> 478.30s]  So over the last like few months, whatever.
[478.50s -> 479.10s]  You know what I mean?
[479.30s -> 480.10s]  Like, okay.
[481.95s -> 484.75s]  I have like permanent wake-up voice.
[485.83s -> 486.63s]  If that makes any sense.
[488.04s -> 489.44s]  I have permanent wake-up voice.
[489.64s -> 493.78s]  From this nasal shit going on,
[494.18s -> 495.58s]  that has not gone away.
[497.30s -> 498.70s]  I don't think it's- I'm not getting old.
[499.66s -> 502.26s]  I have like these cysts that are in my sinuses.
[502.26s -> 503.06s]  There's one-
[503.26s -> 504.66s]  There's one right here in particular,
[504.66s -> 506.26s]  like right there in the back.
[506.83s -> 508.23s]  It's like this big or something.
[508.86s -> 510.06s]  It's like maybe this.
[510.26s -> 510.86s]  Like here.
[511.37s -> 511.97s]  Right there.
[513.62s -> 514.22s]  Like that.
[514.42s -> 516.46s]  They're like these little circles.
[518.57s -> 519.77s]  And they're pissing me off.
[519.77s -> 521.37s]  They're causing me all kinds of fucking problems.
[521.57s -> 524.92s]  Are you pregnant?
[535.60s -> 536.80s]  Arby's sucks.
[536.80s -> 537.20s]  I have-
[537.40s -> 538.00s]  I've had it like-
[538.00s -> 538.80s]  I've- I've- okay.
[539.00s -> 540.60s]  The last time I did this tier list,
[543.44s -> 544.84s]  I ha- I think I said the same thing.
[545.47s -> 548.27s]  I haven't eaten Arby's in a long time.
[548.67s -> 549.87s]  I think I've had it one time,
[549.87s -> 551.67s]  and it was the same opinion that I had
[552.70s -> 554.10s]  when I had it like two years ago.
[554.10s -> 554.90s]  Three years ago, right?
[556.38s -> 557.78s]  I just don't- I don't like it.
[558.41s -> 559.21s]  If I'm- okay.
[559.41s -> 561.21s]  If I'm gonna have a deli sandwich,
[562.10s -> 562.70s]  I'm just gonna-
[562.90s -> 564.30s]  I'm gonna make it at my house.
[565.31s -> 568.71s]  If I want like a turkey and cheese deli sandwich,
[569.86s -> 571.26s]  I could- I could just do that at my house.
[573.10s -> 575.30s]  That's like the reason why I don't really care about Arby's.
[577.34s -> 578.54s]  When I go to like a restaurant,
[578.54s -> 581.14s]  I like to get stuff that I can't really get at my house.
[582.22s -> 584.02s]  Stuff that tastes different,
[584.02s -> 585.42s]  is prepared differently, right?
[587.66s -> 588.46s]  Maybe it's not, you know,
[588.66s -> 590.26s]  it's probably not fair to put it in poor,
[590.46s -> 593.26s]  because it's just like deli sandwiches.
[593.83s -> 595.03s]  It's not like bad.
[596.31s -> 597.11s]  I did just say it sucks,
[597.11s -> 598.51s]  but that's like- that's fake.
[598.89s -> 599.49s]  I didn't mean that.
[602.04s -> 602.44s]  All right.
[602.44s -> 603.64s]  This is, uh,
[604.54s -> 609.46s]  a- a- a Bon Pain.
[610.74s -> 612.34s]  I actually have- I've walked,
[612.54s -> 613.94s]  I think by this restaurant,
[613.94s -> 615.14s]  like three or four times.
[615.84s -> 618.24s]  I think I've seen it on like Google Maps.
[620.22s -> 621.22s]  I've never eaten here.
[627.30s -> 630.50s]  I have like opened up like Google Maps to look for food,
[630.90s -> 632.10s]  and I've seen it pop up.
[634.79s -> 636.19s]  But I've just never- I'm just like, why?
[638.43s -> 640.03s]  Onions is-
[641.11s -> 642.91s]  I'm not- I don't like the buttery pretzel.
[643.42s -> 644.62s]  I like a hard,
[645.02s -> 647.42s]  like bronze pretzel on the outside.
[647.42s -> 648.42s]  That's kind of crunchy.
[649.62s -> 652.02s]  Onions is like kind of soft and buttery.
[652.02s -> 653.22s]  I don't like- it's like more-
[653.22s -> 654.82s]  it's more bread than pretzel to me.
[655.78s -> 656.58s]  I hope you die.
[663.74s -> 664.54s]  And a lot of this guy.
[668.24s -> 669.44s]  I like, uh,
[669.88s -> 673.08s]  really like crusty kind of dark pretzel on the outside.
[673.78s -> 674.58s]  And Onions is-
[675.41s -> 676.61s]  it's kind of like bread.
[677.18s -> 677.98s]  It's not-
[678.18s -> 679.78s]  I know pretzels are bread.
[679.78s -> 680.58s]  I know, I get it.
[681.34s -> 682.94s]  But it's like eating bread,
[683.14s -> 685.50s]  not like pretzel bread.
[685.70s -> 686.50s]  Does that make any sense?
[687.46s -> 688.46s]  I feel like when I go to Onions,
[688.46s -> 691.66s]  I feel like I'm eating like a dinner roll,
[692.16s -> 693.16s]  not a pretzel.
[693.98s -> 694.78s]  Am I insane?
[694.98s -> 695.58s]  I don't think I am.
[696.66s -> 697.46s]  I like it,
[697.66s -> 700.06s]  but I'd rather have like a different kind of pretzel.
[705.24s -> 706.24s]  You have awful taste.
[706.44s -> 710.24s]  Oh, just wait till we get to Domino's,
[710.44s -> 712.64s]  or you have no idea it's going S tier.
[717.69s -> 719.09s]  Okay, uh, Baja Fresh.
[719.09s -> 722.38s]  I've never had it.
[722.58s -> 723.78s]  This is Baskin Robbins.
[726.14s -> 728.74s]  I'm going to put Baskin Robbins in good because of one particular-
[728.94s -> 730.74s]  I got- my fingernails are a little too long.
[731.18s -> 733.18s]  I'm going to put Baskin Robbins up in good
[733.74s -> 737.67s]  because of one type of ice cream they have,
[737.87s -> 743.05s]  and that is their Mom's Making Cookies ice cream.
[743.25s -> 745.94s]  It's so unbelievably good.
[745.94s -> 748.70s]  It's like one of the best ice creams I've ever had in my life.
[748.90s -> 749.50s]  I made a tweet about it.
[749.70s -> 750.98s]  Yeah.
[751.18s -> 752.18s]  And the tweet like sucks.
[752.38s -> 754.18s]  I went back and like looked at that old like tweet.
[754.38s -> 755.78s]  I was like, this joke sucks.
[755.98s -> 756.78s]  And I wanted to delete it,
[756.98s -> 761.27s]  but I didn't keep it there.
[761.90s -> 764.54s]  But yeah, Mom's Making Cookies puts this in good.
[764.74s -> 766.14s]  It's got other stuff is good there too.
[768.43s -> 772.23s]  I would probably put it here if it wasn't for that one type.
[772.80s -> 773.80s]  Now, here's the worst part.
[774.00s -> 776.20s]  Actually, I'm considering dropping it down to average
[776.40s -> 779.24s]  and because that shit's not year round.
[780.19s -> 784.20s]  It's like a weird seasonal thing that they put up sometimes.
[784.40s -> 786.00s]  It's the best flavor you've ever had.
[786.82s -> 789.79s]  You can- Baskin Robbins, listen to me, please God.
[791.26s -> 795.66s]  You can- you can take off like strawberry cheesecake.
[796.99s -> 799.19s]  You can take off like Rocky Road.
[800.40s -> 802.60s]  I just put it up there.
[802.80s -> 804.80s]  Take- take off strawberry cheesecake and put this on.
[807.22s -> 809.42s]  You know how many times you go- how many times you go on to like Baskin Robbins
[809.42s -> 812.22s]  and there's a tub that like had not even been used.
[812.86s -> 814.26s]  Like shit's not even been opened.
[814.46s -> 815.26s]  Nobody's ordering it.
[815.76s -> 816.76s]  They definitely have data.
[816.96s -> 819.16s]  Just take the one that like nobody's ordering
[819.36s -> 822.16s]  and fucking just replace it with Mom's Making Cookies permanently.
[822.36s -> 823.36s]  I don't know why it's not there permanently.
[823.56s -> 827.67s]  It's the best thing they have.
[827.87s -> 829.27s]  Strawberry cheesecake was-
[830.99s -> 832.79s]  I mean, that was just me saying a random one.
[832.99s -> 835.59s]  I'm just saying there's ones there that like have been there forever.
[836.86s -> 838.86s]  And I'm going to be- maybe I'll sound like a weirdo here.
[840.14s -> 843.62s]  Why do we have vanilla ice cream still there?
[845.28s -> 848.48s]  I don't- I've never- I don't think I've ordered a just vanilla ice cream
[849.56s -> 851.16s]  in 10 to 15 years.
[853.52s -> 854.92s]  When was the last time you ordered just like,
[855.12s -> 857.52s]  oh yeah, I'll take one scoop of vanilla ice cream, please,
[857.90s -> 862.02s]  from one of these places.
[862.22s -> 864.02s]  I mean, like, yeah, everyone- it's good.
[864.02s -> 864.62s]  It is good.
[865.95s -> 867.95s]  But like put it in the back in a freezer.
[868.15s -> 869.95s]  Because nobody- people don't order it.
[870.15s -> 871.55s]  Who orders a vanilla ice cream?
[871.75s -> 874.15s]  You order like- I want like half Oreo cookie.
[874.35s -> 875.95s]  I want like half cheesecake.
[876.15s -> 878.55s]  Nobody gets just vanilla ice cream in a cup.
[880.08s -> 881.08s]  This is the worst take.
[881.08s -> 882.08s]  I don't think it is.
[888.66s -> 890.06s]  You can get vanilla ice cream everywhere.
[890.26s -> 894.37s]  Baskin Robbins, all these like craft ice cream places.
[894.37s -> 896.57s]  It's like, oh, look at all our crazy craft ice creams.
[896.77s -> 898.77s]  And then you got vanilla ice cream just sitting there.
[898.97s -> 901.01s]  Not even vanilla bean, by the way.
[901.21s -> 902.50s]  Excuse me.
[905.76s -> 906.96s]  I can get vanilla ice cream anywhere.
[907.16s -> 909.96s]  I tell you, my re- look, my restaurant opinions
[910.16s -> 912.56s]  are based on getting things that I can't get anywhere else.
[912.76s -> 916.71s]  I can't get moms making cookies anywhere else but Baskin Robbins
[916.91s -> 918.91s]  for like two months out of the year or whatever it is.
[919.35s -> 922.95s]  I can get vanilla ice cream in 700 fucking locations
[923.15s -> 927.30s]  within five miles from my current location.
[928.76s -> 929.96s]  I don't think I have to explain this.
[933.22s -> 938.78s]  It's staying an average.
[939.54s -> 943.54s]  I have eaten all tubs of Ben and Jerry's pint ice creams
[943.74s -> 945.94s]  in more than like five to ten thousand times, I think.
[946.14s -> 946.94s]  Well, that's way too much.
[947.14s -> 951.92s]  That's, um, half baked is the best probably ice cream
[951.92s -> 953.92s]  you can get at any grocery store or any place.
[955.96s -> 956.56s]  Half baked.
[956.76s -> 958.76s]  And Ben and Jerry's does this awesome thing
[958.96s -> 960.96s]  that other ice cream places don't do.
[961.72s -> 963.32s]  So Ben and Jerry's does this thing.
[963.52s -> 965.42s]  And I may have had this opinion a few years ago,
[965.62s -> 966.62s]  but I'm going to reiterate it.
[967.77s -> 971.17s]  You, they don't fucking skimp on the cookie dough.
[971.86s -> 975.46s]  It's not these little teeny little sand crystals of cookie dough.
[975.90s -> 978.90s]  They give you these like gobs of cookie dough.
[979.41s -> 981.41s]  Huge chunks of fudge brownie.
[982.04s -> 983.64s]  They don't, that's why they're up here.
[985.23s -> 986.83s]  I hate, there's nothing more that I hate
[987.03s -> 989.03s]  than eating a cookie dough ice cream
[989.73s -> 993.33s]  and you get to like the four or five little chunks of cookie dough
[993.53s -> 997.13s]  that are in there and the rest of it is just ice cream.
[997.33s -> 999.93s]  And you have like half of your entire treat
[1000.13s -> 1001.33s]  that is just ice cream.
[1001.53s -> 1002.73s]  And there's no cookie dough left at all.
[1003.68s -> 1008.48s]  Ben and Jerry's has cookie dough or fudge in almost every single bite
[1008.68s -> 1009.48s]  if you want to.
[1010.05s -> 1010.85s]  And that's the best part about it.
[1011.05s -> 1014.05s]  You can like, you can maneuver around Ben and Jerry's tub.
[1014.55s -> 1017.33s]  Let's say you don't want a bite that has cookie dough in it.
[1017.53s -> 1018.73s]  Oh, it's available for you.
[1018.93s -> 1019.33s]  It's available.
[1019.53s -> 1021.33s]  There's a little space right there you can carve into.
[1021.53s -> 1024.79s]  That's by far the best ice cream brand that you can just buy.
[1024.99s -> 1025.59s]  I like a store.
[1029.55s -> 1031.35s]  I don't know what Biscuitville is.
[1035.31s -> 1036.91s]  Bro, that's not a restaurant.
[1037.11s -> 1042.14s]  Wait, yes it is.
[1042.34s -> 1044.99s]  Don't they have, yes it is.
[1045.19s -> 1049.66s]  They have Ben and Jerry's like little like restaurants and stuff.
[1049.86s -> 1050.26s]  Yeah, they do.
[1052.75s -> 1053.55s]  They have locations.
[1053.75s -> 1059.69s]  Blaze Pizza.
[1068.38s -> 1069.78s]  I'm going to put Blaze, hold on.
[1069.98s -> 1070.98s]  I know everyone's freaking out.
[1072.26s -> 1074.06s]  Blaze Pizza might sit somewhere here,
[1074.26s -> 1077.86s]  but I almost feel like it's unfair for...
[1081.63s -> 1082.43s]  Okay, I'm going to go on.
[1082.63s -> 1087.34s]  I'm going to tell you a cookie dough rant here for Blaze Pizza.
[1087.54s -> 1090.84s]  Blaze Pizza does half pies.
[1091.04s -> 1097.56s]  It's a little rectangle box and it's half a pizza.
[1097.76s -> 1100.74s]  It's actually pretty awesome.
[1101.76s -> 1102.76s]  Forget about the taste.
[1102.76s -> 1104.56s]  Just the fact that they package that that way.
[1104.76s -> 1107.16s]  You can order a half pizza and you can DIY the whole thing.
[1107.36s -> 1117.18s]  Yeah, I'm going to keep it here for now.
[1117.38s -> 1120.41s]  Because I think I've only had it like a handful of times
[1120.61s -> 1122.61s]  and I don't really remember how much I liked or disliked it.
[1126.18s -> 1127.38s]  It's definitely better than the Domino's.
[1132.56s -> 1133.96s]  Blimpie.
[1134.85s -> 1140.76s]  Blimpie?
[1140.96s -> 1144.76s]  Why does this look like somebody wanted to put like Subway in a video game
[1144.96s -> 1147.14s]  and not get like copyright striked?
[1148.22s -> 1149.22s]  That's like what I'm seeing.
[1149.42s -> 1153.91s]  What is this?
[1154.11s -> 1154.71s]  I never heard of it.
[1156.05s -> 1156.85s]  Blimpie.
[1160.23s -> 1160.83s]  I don't know.
[1161.03s -> 1162.23s]  I love subs though.
[1163.76s -> 1164.36s]  It sucks.
[1164.36s -> 1164.96s]  I've never had it.
[1165.16s -> 1167.70s]  I can't say that.
[1167.90s -> 1169.70s]  Bob Evans restaurant.
[1170.59s -> 1174.39s]  I've had Bob Evans mashed potatoes, the microwave ones.
[1174.59s -> 1175.79s]  And those are...
[1177.32s -> 1178.32s]  Can I rate those?
[1178.52s -> 1181.72s]  Can I rate the whole restaurant based only on the mashed potatoes
[1181.92s -> 1183.52s]  and the microwave section?
[1189.08s -> 1190.28s]  Is this even the same person?
[1190.48s -> 1191.88s]  Is this even the same company?
[1193.60s -> 1195.00s]  Make a new meme.
[1195.20s -> 1200.57s]  No, because the rest of the place is not...
[1200.77s -> 1201.97s]  It's your tier list.
[1203.50s -> 1204.50s]  I don't think that's fair.
[1204.70s -> 1207.10s]  I would put their mashed potatoes like somewhere up here though.
[1208.50s -> 1210.30s]  Although they could be a little too salty sometimes.
[1210.50s -> 1211.10s]  Depends.
[1211.60s -> 1214.20s]  But the microwave Bob Evans is pretty good.
[1216.05s -> 1219.59s]  I don't know about the rest of the restaurant.
[1219.79s -> 1221.39s]  Bojangles I've not had.
[1222.34s -> 1223.14s]  Boston Market.
[1223.34s -> 1227.33s]  It's been a long time, but it's good.
[1229.75s -> 1232.79s]  I think it's very good, but I don't remember how good.
[1234.83s -> 1235.43s]  Make a meme.
[1235.63s -> 1236.63s]  All right, fine.
[1237.33s -> 1237.93s]  No, never mind.
[1238.13s -> 1240.73s]  I was going to just show you like all my teeth and I don't want to do that.
[1242.06s -> 1244.66s]  I was going to put my fingers in like this and just go like that.
[1245.68s -> 1247.08s]  No, that would be very bad.
[1248.35s -> 1249.15s]  I've never had it.
[1252.86s -> 1254.46s]  Roosters?
[1255.02s -> 1256.02s]  I've never had this.
[1258.06s -> 1259.26s]  Burger Fi.
[1261.56s -> 1262.96s]  Or is that Burger Florida?
[1266.15s -> 1267.65s]  I've never had it.
[1267.85s -> 1269.25s]  What is this one?
[1269.45s -> 1270.85s]  Burger M?
[1271.05s -> 1273.94s]  What's Burger Fi and Burger M?
[1274.14s -> 1275.54s]  Are these two the same place?
[1278.02s -> 1278.62s]  I don't know.
[1278.82s -> 1293.38s]  Burger M and Burger Fi.
[1293.58s -> 1294.58s]  Burger King is just...
[1294.78s -> 1295.78s]  It's just not.
[1304.42s -> 1307.42s]  I'm trying to think if I would rather eat Burger King or Domino's.
[1307.86s -> 1311.87s]  And I would rather eat Burger King.
[1312.07s -> 1313.47s]  This is going to get cleaned up.
[1313.91s -> 1315.11s]  Relax, I'm going to clean this up.
[1315.31s -> 1318.11s]  So people are saying, I can't believe Arby's is ahead of Burger King.
[1318.74s -> 1319.54s]  I'm going to clean it up.
[1319.74s -> 1327.42s]  And Auntie Anne's should absolutely be ahead of Arby's for sure, without a doubt.
[1327.62s -> 1328.22s]  We're going to sort this.
[1328.22s -> 1329.02s]  Just hold on.
[1330.17s -> 1336.10s]  California Pizza Kitchen I've had once and I don't even remember what it tasted like.
[1336.30s -> 1337.10s]  I can't rate it.
[1337.86s -> 1338.86s]  I had it one time.
[1339.06s -> 1340.46s]  I have no idea.
[1340.66s -> 1342.26s]  I have no memory of what it tasted like.
[1345.20s -> 1346.60s]  Captain D's.
[1348.26s -> 1349.46s]  Charles Jr.
[1349.66s -> 1350.46s]  I've never had it.
[1353.46s -> 1356.06s]  Charlie's Philly Cheese Steaks.
[1357.39s -> 1360.17s]  I think I've had this once.
[1364.19s -> 1365.59s]  How many places have I had?
[1370.51s -> 1373.51s]  You're insane for putting Blaze Pizza above Domino's.
[1374.08s -> 1375.68s]  I'm telling you, I'm going to clean this up.
[1375.88s -> 1381.79s]  This is just to get it in general location.
[1381.99s -> 1385.99s]  OK, a lot of sandwich, hot sandwich places.
[1386.75s -> 1390.22s]  I go to local places for this.
[1390.42s -> 1395.62s]  I don't go to most chains to get a Philly steak, Philly cheese steak.
[1395.82s -> 1398.86s]  I go to like a local place.
[1398.86s -> 1400.86s]  I may have had this once, but not really.
[1401.06s -> 1404.75s]  I've not had this at all.
[1406.73s -> 1409.33s]  All right, Chick-fil-A is going up here.
[1409.53s -> 1413.94s]  I don't know.
[1413.94s -> 1419.66s]  I think I would rather have Boston Market, although this.
[1419.86s -> 1420.86s]  OK, here's one thing about.
[1421.06s -> 1425.55s]  OK, I didn't like that drive through experience.
[1428.81s -> 1429.61s]  It's good, though.
[1429.81s -> 1437.52s]  It's like too crowded.
[1437.72s -> 1438.12s]  I don't know.
[1438.32s -> 1447.88s]  And is it too crowded and too obscene to like go get that for how much I think I like it?
[1450.94s -> 1451.54s]  We'll see.
[1451.74s -> 1454.10s]  It's better.
[1454.30s -> 1455.10s]  Auntie Anne's is better.
[1455.30s -> 1457.60s]  Auntie Anne's is probably should be here.
[1458.23s -> 1459.83s]  I was I think I was a little too harsh.
[1460.03s -> 1462.40s]  I think it was a little too harsh on Auntie Anne's.
[1463.03s -> 1463.63s]  I think so.
[1466.57s -> 1468.17s]  Maybe should I put Auntie Anne's up to good?
[1469.57s -> 1472.37s]  McChicken will always shine brighter.
[1473.58s -> 1474.58s]  I am going to.
[1474.78s -> 1477.98s]  OK, let's just do it now because people are going to fucking freak out.
[1478.18s -> 1479.58s]  McDonald's is up here.
[1479.78s -> 1480.98s]  I love this place.
[1481.18s -> 1482.18s]  Like, I'm sorry.
[1482.38s -> 1482.98s]  I do.
[1483.18s -> 1484.98s]  I love McDonald's.
[1485.18s -> 1486.87s]  People are going to fucking freak out.
[1487.07s -> 1487.47s]  I know you are.
[1487.67s -> 1491.02s]  I know.
[1491.22s -> 1495.79s]  I look it's like I like grew up eating McDonald's.
[1495.99s -> 1501.82s]  It was like like a childhood like memory.
[1502.02s -> 1504.22s]  The McChicken is so good.
[1504.42s -> 1508.71s]  It's so like it brings me back like memories and stuff.
[1508.91s -> 1510.20s]  I don't know.
[1510.40s -> 1511.40s]  I love McDonald's.
[1512.10s -> 1515.70s]  You can call me a fucking disgusting loser all you want.
[1515.90s -> 1519.27s]  I actually really do like it.
[1519.47s -> 1521.67s]  Look, I don't just put how much I like the food.
[1521.87s -> 1529.92s]  I put like memories, atmosphere, 500 cars in the drive-through.
[1530.12s -> 1530.52s]  You know what I mean?
[1530.72s -> 1533.32s]  Like I just all comes into my brain.
[1533.95s -> 1535.88s]  Right.
[1536.08s -> 1542.81s]  So when I'm sitting here going seven years old, four piece chicken nuggets,
[1543.01s -> 1551.78s]  apple slice, not a thousand fucking people at the restaurant screaming at each other.
[1551.98s -> 1552.82s]  Good.
[1553.02s -> 1556.02s]  Good delicious McChickens, McDoubles, everything.
[1556.02s -> 1559.66s]  Oh, yeah. It's up there.
[1559.86s -> 1560.66s]  Using nostalgia.
[1560.66s -> 1561.66s]  Yeah, I am.
[1561.86s -> 1564.46s]  It's not about just how good quotes the food is.
[1564.96s -> 1569.47s]  There's other things that factor in.
[1569.67s -> 1570.87s]  A play place. Yeah.
[1573.42s -> 1573.82s]  Fuck this.
[1573.82s -> 1580.38s]  It's going up. No, it's not.
[1580.58s -> 1585.50s]  You're literally conditioned to like McDonald's.
[1585.70s -> 1592.70s]  That's fucking stupid.
[1592.90s -> 1594.70s]  Yeah, I remember that comment from last time.
[1594.90s -> 1596.79s]  Eat a McDick.
[1596.99s -> 1599.74s]  Oh, I remember that one.
[1599.94s -> 1607.77s]  I knew three years later, two years later, I was going to have to defend this again.
[1607.97s -> 1609.17s]  Oh, man.
[1610.38s -> 1611.78s]  People are going to be really mad.
[1611.98s -> 1629.76s]  I don't think I think this is very overrated, like very, very overrated, but it's better than Arby's.
[1633.85s -> 1637.69s]  Look, I don't think it's bad,
[1637.89s -> 1643.42s]  but I'm telling you right now, there are especially here,
[1643.42s -> 1646.02s]  especially in the southwestern United States,
[1646.72s -> 1656.34s]  there are some incredible local Mexican restaurants that I would rather go to a hundred times over.
[1656.54s -> 1664.24s]  I find them 10 million times better, in my opinion, and a lot of times they might even be cheaper or the same price.
[1666.41s -> 1667.61s]  It's like a thousand times better.
[1667.81s -> 1673.85s]  If there's a Chipotle like here and across the street is like a local Mexican
[1674.05s -> 1676.85s]  like restaurant that serves like authentic Mexican.
[1679.21s -> 1680.61s]  I'm going to go here.
[1680.81s -> 1681.81s]  I'm not going to go here.
[1681.81s -> 1682.61s]  I'm going to go here.
[1688.74s -> 1690.54s]  Chipotle is the definition of sus.
[1690.74s -> 1692.96s]  I don't think it's good.
[1693.16s -> 1695.36s]  Like I've eaten Chipotle more than a few times.
[1697.08s -> 1703.75s]  But if it's literally at the bottom of the list, if there's even one decent Mexican restaurant,
[1703.95s -> 1709.58s]  like a local Mexican restaurant, it's not even it's not even on my mind to even think to go there.
[1714.12s -> 1715.92s]  But that doesn't mean the food is bad, right?
[1716.12s -> 1726.90s]  Like I just it's probably like it's probably like here.
[1727.10s -> 1731.91s]  Realistically, it's probably here.
[1732.11s -> 1734.48s]  But no, no, I don't know.
[1736.20s -> 1739.40s]  But put CC's in F if you've never been.
[1749.44s -> 1751.24s]  I've not had Church's chicken.
[1752.32s -> 1753.92s]  CC's pizza.
[1755.58s -> 1756.58s]  I mean, I haven't had it.
[1756.78s -> 1760.90s]  So bro, rate Taco Bell.
[1763.70s -> 1765.10s]  Cinnabon is so good.
[1765.30s -> 1768.50s]  But I mean, I haven't had it in a long time.
[1768.70s -> 1773.68s]  Cold Stone Creamery.
[1776.74s -> 1777.74s]  Cold Stone is good.
[1777.94s -> 1778.74s]  It is.
[1782.38s -> 1784.98s]  Cold Stone is really good, isn't it?
[1786.38s -> 1787.58s]  But wait, isn't wait, hold on.
[1787.78s -> 1788.98s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1789.18s -> 1793.18s]  Cold Stone is the place that doesn't have sizes, right?
[1793.38s -> 1794.78s]  It has like I like it.
[1794.98s -> 1795.58s]  I love it.
[1795.78s -> 1796.78s]  I really love you.
[1796.98s -> 1797.78s]  Right, right.
[1797.98s -> 1798.78s]  Is that what it is?
[1802.30s -> 1803.90s]  And if you tip, they have to sing a song.
[1804.10s -> 1804.50s]  No, no.
[1804.50s -> 1805.70s]  Let me just give the money to the person.
[1805.90s -> 1807.70s]  Like, yeah, this is going down here.
[1814.09s -> 1815.89s]  No, I just want to I just want to you know,
[1816.09s -> 1820.46s]  like I just want to like put like fucking cash in an envelope and like tape it
[1820.46s -> 1826.51s]  to the fucking back of the door in front of the restaurant and just be like and just fucking leave.
[1827.02s -> 1827.62s]  You know what I mean?
[1828.76s -> 1829.96s]  I don't want to be sung to.
[1830.16s -> 1831.56s]  I don't like being sung to.
[1832.38s -> 1833.58s]  I hate I don't want to be sung to,
[1833.78s -> 1836.58s]  especially even like restaurants birthday shit when they come over and like clap.
[1836.78s -> 1837.98s]  No, please leave me alone.
[1838.18s -> 1838.78s]  Please.
[1838.98s -> 1840.98s]  I don't even going to give you like a free cupcake.
[1840.98s -> 1841.58s]  I don't want it.
[1842.54s -> 1842.94s]  I do.
[1842.94s -> 1843.74s]  Please leave me alone.
[1846.80s -> 1849.80s]  I would rather just like have us do a transaction and then be done with it.
[1851.90s -> 1855.30s]  I don't want to look around and be like, oh, yeah.
[1855.94s -> 1857.34s]  No, because I feel weird.
[1857.34s -> 1857.94s]  I don't like it.
[1863.18s -> 1864.78s]  You placed Arby's above Domino's.
[1864.98s -> 1866.58s]  Do you have bad taste buds?
[1866.58s -> 1867.78s]  Look, it's not done.
[1867.78s -> 1869.18s]  I'm just getting everything in the right spot.
[1869.38s -> 1872.11s]  My Cold Stone doesn't do that.
[1872.31s -> 1873.11s]  Did they get rid of it?
[1873.31s -> 1879.82s]  Wait, I want to read what this person said.
[1880.32s -> 1886.26s]  If you put KFC low, I'm going to buy you a ticket to Europe so you can see how much better it is here.
[1886.46s -> 1889.86s]  I think KFC.
[1890.06s -> 1891.06s]  I like KFC.
[1891.26s -> 1895.80s]  I like Cold Stone's ice cream is good.
[1896.00s -> 1899.05s]  Well, I don't like being sung to.
[1899.25s -> 1900.74s]  Maybe I'm just a weirdo.
[1901.76s -> 1902.36s]  It's good.
[1902.56s -> 1903.56s]  The ice cream is good.
[1904.83s -> 1907.60s]  They do like the weird size names.
[1907.80s -> 1911.04s]  I know like I'm not the first person on the internet to talk about this.
[1911.24s -> 1913.04s]  I know everyone has made a comment on this,
[1915.15s -> 1917.75s]  but just small, medium, and large.
[1917.95s -> 1919.15s]  It's so fucking easy.
[1919.35s -> 1919.95s]  It's so simple.
[1920.15s -> 1922.75s]  I don't know why we have to like, I don't know.
[1923.19s -> 1923.59s]  All right.
[1924.03s -> 1924.43s]  We'll see.
[1924.63s -> 1927.21s]  Cookout.
[1928.35s -> 1928.95s]  I've never had it.
[1929.15s -> 1931.94s]  Culvers.
[1932.14s -> 1933.94s]  I think I've heard of this, but I haven't had it.
[1935.34s -> 1936.34s]  Dairy Queen.
[1936.54s -> 1951.09s]  I had a cheeseburger from Dairy Queen one time.
[1953.26s -> 1971.10s]  I had a cheeseburger from Dairy Queen one time and I'm trying to remember how bad it was.
[1971.30s -> 1972.70s]  Wait, I gotta put myself back.
[1978.46s -> 1979.06s]  Cheese is melted.
[1979.26s -> 1983.59s]  Okay, it smells good.
[1984.80s -> 1985.20s]  I remember waiting.
[1985.40s -> 1986.80s]  I remember standing around waiting.
[1987.00s -> 1987.80s]  I could smell.
[1989.39s -> 1990.39s]  Cheese was melted.
[1990.59s -> 1992.19s]  There was crispy lettuce on it.
[1993.27s -> 1999.38s]  Took a while though.
[1999.58s -> 2000.38s]  Mmm.
[2000.58s -> 2002.95s]  I wasn't a fan of their selection.
[2003.15s -> 2004.15s]  Okay, I got it.
[2007.92s -> 2008.32s]  You're a psycho.
[2008.52s -> 2008.72s]  What?
[2008.92s -> 2009.52s]  I'm just...
[2009.72s -> 2011.12s]  I can time travel in my own head.
[2011.32s -> 2015.45s]  What do you guys can't do that?
[2015.65s -> 2017.55s]  You know that you can time travel?
[2017.75s -> 2021.86s]  You can just go back into like your own memories and just time travel back to a different time.
[2022.06s -> 2023.46s]  Isn't that insane that you can do that?
[2025.50s -> 2034.61s]  Like I can literally close my eyes and just like be like at some point like in the past.
[2034.81s -> 2044.22s]  Jack can't even rotate a cube in their head.
[2044.42s -> 2046.02s]  Yeah, people gave me shit for this before.
[2046.22s -> 2047.22s]  It's just a memory.
[2047.42s -> 2048.62s]  I know, but isn't a memory...
[2048.82s -> 2050.42s]  We've already had this conversation.
[2050.62s -> 2055.00s]  A memory is like internal time travel.
[2055.20s -> 2056.80s]  I like Del Taco a lot.
[2059.99s -> 2061.39s]  This is going to be very hard.
[2072.39s -> 2075.72s]  You know why I like Del Taco?
[2075.92s -> 2079.52s]  Because Del Taco has fries.
[2079.72s -> 2080.92s]  That's like kind of cool.
[2084.62s -> 2086.42s]  It's like, no, that's pretty cool.
[2088.91s -> 2089.51s]  Yeah, they have fries.
[2089.71s -> 2092.30s]  They have fries.
[2092.50s -> 2099.89s]  What an American.
[2100.09s -> 2104.29s]  As somebody that grew up like in Boston, in the Boston area,
[2104.49s -> 2110.38s]  it feels horrible to put this here, but it's fucking awful now.
[2111.27s -> 2111.87s]  Awful.
[2114.23s -> 2122.20s]  It sucks because 10 years ago, this would have been like up here, maybe here.
[2122.40s -> 2127.40s]  My opinion was solidified on Dunkin' Donuts recently, like within the last year.
[2128.35s -> 2136.20s]  I had it and it was probably the worst coffee I've ever had in my entire life.
[2136.40s -> 2140.81s]  And I remember just taking like a few sips and being like, what the fuck, man?
[2141.01s -> 2147.26s]  Like what happened?
[2147.46s -> 2153.38s]  But what about like Dave's making the donuts?
[2153.58s -> 2154.18s]  You know what I mean?
[2154.68s -> 2171.26s]  The guy with the mustache and he would turn around to the camera with a big tray.
[2171.46s -> 2173.46s]  I remember Dave from Dunkin' Donuts.
[2173.66s -> 2175.46s]  It was like he was supposed to be like the owner.
[2175.66s -> 2178.26s]  He like owned the restaurant and he made the donuts.
[2181.38s -> 2187.03s]  It was like, it's me, Dave from Dunkin' Donuts.
[2187.23s -> 2188.63s]  That's the only reason why it's up here.
[2189.71s -> 2191.49s]  But it's just it's not.
[2191.69s -> 2194.52s]  In my personal opinion, it's just not.
[2194.72s -> 2195.72s]  It's not very good.
[2195.92s -> 2198.92s]  And I remember maybe it was it always bad?
[2198.92s -> 2199.52s]  I don't know.
[2199.72s -> 2202.34s]  I remember like at least five to ten years ago.
[2202.34s -> 2204.14s]  It was like, holy shit, a blueberry iced coffee.
[2204.34s -> 2206.94s]  But you know, you guys have seen me drink this shit on camera.
[2207.14s -> 2209.17s]  Oh, blueberry iced coffee.
[2209.17s -> 2211.57s]  It was like a joke on the channel like five, six years ago.
[2213.48s -> 2214.28s]  I don't know what happened.
[2214.66s -> 2215.66s]  I don't like it anymore.
[2217.12s -> 2220.52s]  But holy shit, the blueberry iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts was the best thing I ever drank.
[2220.72s -> 2229.45s]  Denny's gets points because it's never closed ever in like the history of the human race.
[2229.65s -> 2231.82s]  Like that's the only reason why they get points.
[2232.02s -> 2240.54s]  But like Galileo was going to Denny's and like they never closed
[2240.54s -> 2241.94s]  and they've always been open since then.
[2243.72s -> 2246.32s]  So it belongs up and like it's OK.
[2246.52s -> 2247.92s]  I like it. It's all right.
[2262.82s -> 2265.02s]  Dunkin' is of all franchises.
[2265.22s -> 2266.82s]  I'm sure it's total shit on the West Coast.
[2267.02s -> 2269.62s]  It's still fire on the East Coast, I promise.
[2270.38s -> 2274.75s]  But I have this opinion, OK?
[2275.32s -> 2278.32s]  If you have a good product and it's really good and people love it,
[2279.53s -> 2282.13s]  you need to make sure that that product is good everywhere.
[2282.33s -> 2286.13s]  You cannot have your name on a product and just blow it over
[2286.33s -> 2289.53s]  and just over expand to a point where the product is not the same product.
[2289.53s -> 2290.73s]  Like it's a worse product.
[2292.13s -> 2296.23s]  If you have that good product, it's got to be good everywhere.
[2300.51s -> 2303.11s]  Like if I go to the East Coast and get a blueberry iced coffee and I go,
[2303.11s -> 2304.31s]  holy shit, this is incredible.
[2305.07s -> 2306.67s]  What the fuck am I drinking over here?
[2306.87s -> 2307.87s]  You know what I mean?
[2308.25s -> 2309.25s]  That's why.
[2309.45s -> 2310.85s]  Is it even Dunkin' Donuts?
[2311.05s -> 2312.57s]  Does it have to be called something else?
[2317.04s -> 2318.80s]  Dave works at every store.
[2326.02s -> 2327.82s]  They can't control every one of them.
[2330.18s -> 2334.70s]  I'm just saying I've been to at least three or four separate locations
[2334.90s -> 2337.82s]  of Dunkin' Donuts in the last like three or four years.
[2339.42s -> 2344.10s]  And it's not it's I have been personally thought it was not very good each time.
[2349.40s -> 2353.50s]  These are good, but I have not had it enough.
[2355.92s -> 2357.48s]  Eat a Dunkin'
[2365.60s -> 2367.44s]  whatever time that person out for like five minutes.
[2367.64s -> 2370.10s]  What the fuck? OK.
[2370.73s -> 2378.29s]  Uh, yeah, I remember this place being pretty good.
[2378.49s -> 2380.77s]  I've still not had this.
[2382.42s -> 2385.30s]  OK, I'm going to put this up here because I want I want this.
[2385.50s -> 2387.26s]  I see it. It's everywhere.
[2387.90s -> 2389.14s]  I want this.
[2389.77s -> 2390.93s]  I need to have this.
[2393.12s -> 2394.96s]  I've never I've not had El Pollo Loco.
[2395.16s -> 2399.61s]  Not yet. It's OK.
[2401.90s -> 2404.06s]  We have it in. Yeah, I heard it's good.
[2404.26s -> 2406.90s]  I heard it's like because they give you
[2408.05s -> 2411.73s]  it's like a chicken drumstick and like sides.
[2411.73s -> 2414.45s]  It's like it's like I'm not it's like fast food, but it's not right.
[2414.89s -> 2417.73s]  It's like a KFC if there wasn't like breading on the chicken.
[2417.73s -> 2418.93s]  Right. But do I have that correct?
[2424.04s -> 2424.88s]  It's pretty healthy.
[2427.37s -> 2428.73s]  Yeah, I want to try it.
[2429.17s -> 2432.49s]  I've seen a thousand of these locations and I'm just like, fuck,
[2432.49s -> 2433.93s]  I want to have it one day.
[2436.29s -> 2437.49s]  But this falls into the same category.
[2437.49s -> 2443.57s]  The problem that I have, like eating chipotle, right, is like El Pollo Loco
[2443.77s -> 2448.98s]  will be there and I'm like, oh, El Pollo Loco local Mexican restaurant right here.
[2449.18s -> 2450.14s]  Yeah, that's where I'm going.
[2450.34s -> 2451.82s]  I it's tough for me to do.
[2452.02s -> 2456.18s]  Mexican food is my number one, probably at least one or two favorite food
[2456.38s -> 2460.58s]  in the world, so I like always don't have an opportunity to go here
[2460.78s -> 2463.90s]  because if I if I'm like, I want to try El Pollo Loco,
[2464.66s -> 2467.38s]  that place has a burrito that's fucking incredible.
[2467.38s -> 2469.86s]  And it's the best burrito I've had in like my whole life.
[2469.94s -> 2472.42s]  I like it's hard for me to go there to El Pollo Loco.
[2475.03s -> 2476.31s]  All right. Fat burger.
[2476.51s -> 2482.10s]  I don't have I have I had this baby.
[2484.46s -> 2486.58s]  Why do I remember this for some reason?
[2493.03s -> 2494.83s]  Maybe I've had it like once.
[2497.13s -> 2499.77s]  This logo is familiar and I like I remember
[2499.77s -> 2502.05s]  the logo and I remember like it tasting good.
[2505.56s -> 2506.52s]  I'm going to put it here for now.
[2506.52s -> 2507.48s]  This has to move.
[2508.56s -> 2509.92s]  I'll fix this in a minute. Don't worry.
[2513.37s -> 2516.51s]  I've done I've not had Zoli's.
[2518.87s -> 2520.35s]  I'm going to purpose going to be gross.
[2521.69s -> 2522.49s]  No, I didn't.
[2522.69s -> 2524.49s]  OK. Firehouse subs is good.
[2531.65s -> 2532.73s]  Hmm.
[2536.69s -> 2540.22s]  Although I like Firehouse subs,
[2541.50s -> 2544.10s]  but I feel like they're this selection is a little limited for me.
[2546.71s -> 2549.43s]  They have like a handful of like their specialty sandwiches.
[2552.82s -> 2558.62s]  But again, I would not go to Firehouse if I could go like, you know,
[2558.82s -> 2561.26s]  Frank Pizza's Pizzeria and it's like fucking great.
[2561.26s -> 2563.66s]  And it's like subs and shit and pizza like, I don't know.
[2567.05s -> 2569.85s]  I actually genuinely think it's better than.
[2571.76s -> 2573.24s]  Yeah, we'll have to go through this again.
[2575.79s -> 2577.83s]  Five Guys is really good.
[2579.64s -> 2580.60s]  It is.
[2580.80s -> 2584.08s]  But their fries are total absolute ass.
[2592.01s -> 2596.37s]  I know people think that's a weird opinion, but I think the fries are fucking awful.
[2600.58s -> 2601.98s]  Their burgers are amazing.
[2610.04s -> 2613.92s]  I'm going to. OK, the perfect French fry to me.
[2614.12s -> 2615.60s]  And you guys all know what I'm talking about.
[2615.60s -> 2619.32s]  And maybe, OK, whatever your opinion on me after this is how you're going to have
[2619.52s -> 2621.94s]  the opinion, right? French fry.
[2622.38s -> 2627.54s]  I like the I like the orange French fries that are crunchy on the outside.
[2627.70s -> 2630.10s]  And they're a little bit long and thicker.
[2630.30s -> 2632.30s]  They're like crunchy and they're orange.
[2632.93s -> 2634.65s]  You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[2634.85s -> 2636.33s]  They're like a dark orange color.
[2637.73s -> 2639.41s]  They're like crunch.
[2639.57s -> 2643.41s]  And there's like it's they're crunchy and they have like this potato in the middle.
[2643.98s -> 2646.26s]  Not a carrot. I'm not eating carrots.
[2646.70s -> 2647.66s]  Not sweet potato.
[2648.35s -> 2653.83s]  It's like from takeout restaurants, the dark orange long French fry.
[2655.87s -> 2656.83s]  Not a wedge, no.
[2659.70s -> 2662.10s]  I know that some people know exactly what I'm talking about.
[2662.30s -> 2663.34s]  It's like that either.
[2663.54s -> 2667.70s]  Yeah, it'll be like orange.
[2669.10s -> 2670.50s]  I don't like French.
[2670.70s -> 2678.20s]  OK, this is how many times I said, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.
[2678.40s -> 2680.56s]  How many times? Listen, OK, OK.
[2682.41s -> 2688.49s]  I know that French fries are potatoes that you just julienne them
[2688.69s -> 2691.81s]  and you put them in some oil and that's a that's a French fry.
[2692.01s -> 2696.36s]  Right. But I don't like potato French fries.
[2696.70s -> 2702.22s]  I like my French fries to be crispy on the outside with like a good crunch,
[2702.22s -> 2704.02s]  with some of that like potato in the middle.
[2711.18s -> 2712.02s]  You're insane.
[2714.77s -> 2718.09s]  He doesn't know what you julienne julienne slice.
[2719.55s -> 2721.63s]  You guys don't know how you guys don't know what that means.
[2724.63s -> 2730.28s]  They're too mushy. Yeah, they're chefs in chat.
[2730.28s -> 2731.20s]  What's going on here?
[2732.15s -> 2734.23s]  Does he know that he's on stream?
[2735.06s -> 2740.34s]  All right. For a second, I thought I had like a electrode on my temple
[2741.03s -> 2744.79s]  because this I just like glanced over here, like at the preview.
[2746.09s -> 2748.61s]  So you're here and the preview is here.
[2749.37s -> 2754.97s]  I just looked over here and was like, what the fuck is attached to my head?
[2755.17s -> 2762.02s]  Am I like what am I connected to?
[2762.22s -> 2763.22s]  Electrode.
[2765.52s -> 2774.08s]  OK, it's been a very long time since I've even seen a Friendlies,
[2774.28s -> 2777.98s]  but I remember it being in the same tier as like Denny's.
[2781.17s -> 2788.19s]  But they had this thing called a Jubilee roll at Friendlies.
[2788.76s -> 2793.04s]  And it was this ice cream roll that had like frosting on top.
[2793.24s -> 2794.20s]  And you had to cut it.
[2794.40s -> 2795.64s]  It was like ice cream roll.
[2795.80s -> 2804.04s]  It puts it ahead, puts it ahead.
[2806.21s -> 2807.41s]  Arby's has mozzarella sticks.
[2807.61s -> 2814.14s]  Sorry, I came here to defend Arby's.
[2814.34s -> 2816.02s]  I gave my opinion on Arby's.
[2816.22s -> 2822.52s]  I if I want a like turkey sandwich, like deli sliced, like roast beef sandwich,
[2822.72s -> 2826.56s]  I just can get that at the deli at the I can make it literally from the fridge.
[2827.64s -> 2828.96s]  That's not to say it's bad.
[2833.18s -> 2843.57s]  Arby's defenders exist of Fuddruckers.
[2843.77s -> 2848.27s]  I've had it. It was good, but not good enough for me to remember and go.
[2848.27s -> 2853.77s]  Oh, yeah, I feel like it was better than this, though.
[2858.90s -> 2861.92s]  Brash green burrito.
[2862.12s -> 2863.69s]  I've never had it.
[2863.89s -> 2865.93s]  Hardee's and Carl's Jr.
[2866.13s -> 2869.09s]  This is like the correct me if I'm wrong, but Carl's Jr.
[2869.29s -> 2872.89s]  or Hardee's is just a League of Legends skin of Carl's Jr.
[2872.89s -> 2877.28s]  Right. I've not had either one of them.
[2880.73s -> 2888.04s]  Harvey's, Uddlehouse, IHOP is kind of in the Denny's tier.
[2888.93s -> 2890.29s]  It's just always open.
[2891.18s -> 2892.58s]  But I think I would rather go to Denny's.
[2893.34s -> 2909.31s]  Oh, certainly alarm off.
[2913.91s -> 2915.27s]  Oh, shit, there's a lot of new viewers.
[2915.47s -> 2917.83s]  There are a lot of new people here.
[2918.30s -> 2929.29s]  Oh, how many people are here?
[2929.73s -> 2931.33s]  I think the average concurrent viewers
[2931.33s -> 2935.01s]  that I have when I did this last time was probably like 4000.
[2936.86s -> 2939.34s]  There's a shitload of new people that probably love this place.
[2939.38s -> 2942.81s]  And I'm about to literally just I'm about
[2942.81s -> 2945.17s]  to literally just fucking make you probably leave the channel.
[2961.67s -> 2963.27s]  What do I say to them? OK.
[2963.84s -> 2969.59s]  In and out is good, but I put it in the same category as no, that's not fair.
[2969.59s -> 2971.63s]  I was going to say Chipotle. That's unfair.
[2971.63s -> 2972.83s]  It's way better than Chipotle.
[2972.83s -> 2975.23s]  And I like it. I would rather go there than Chipotle.
[2978.49s -> 2983.17s]  It's good, but it's not so good that I would.
[2983.37s -> 2984.65s]  It's not S tier.
[2988.03s -> 2994.35s]  I have a problem with the secret menu in a lot of these places.
[2994.55s -> 2997.47s]  I have to this like 10000 plus more people here than we're last time.
[2997.47s -> 2999.51s]  I have to tell I have to tell them about this.
[3002.32s -> 3006.30s]  Dick, they have a menu and then they have this secret menu.
[3006.50s -> 3008.30s]  But like, who fucking cares?
[3008.50s -> 3009.82s]  Why is it even on? Why?
[3010.02s -> 3013.90s]  Just put it on the menu and wrap the burgers.
[3013.90s -> 3015.70s]  I don't want like
[3015.90s -> 3019.46s]  like half open and it's like in a bag that I got like through the drive through.
[3021.56s -> 3023.12s]  It's not a secret anymore.
[3023.32s -> 3024.44s]  Animal style fries.
[3024.64s -> 3027.48s]  It's not like, oh, quiet.
[3027.68s -> 3031.46s]  Hey, I think I'll order that burger animal style.
[3031.84s -> 3033.52s]  Whoa, what?
[3034.09s -> 3035.85s]  What do you say, Stu?
[3035.85s -> 3037.61s]  Don't fucking say that so loud.
[3037.81s -> 3040.05s]  What's wrong with you? Don't say that so loud.
[3041.64s -> 3042.84s]  Just put it on the menu.
[3045.52s -> 3049.69s]  Wait, wait a minute.
[3051.09s -> 3054.94s]  I was told that in and out.
[3055.66s -> 3056.94s]  This is another problem I have with it.
[3057.14s -> 3059.14s]  OK, big problem I have with in and out.
[3059.65s -> 3064.21s]  I ordered in and out the way I am supposed to order the burger, right?
[3065.22s -> 3066.06s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3066.06s -> 3068.70s]  You can't just go to in and out and order the burger on the menu.
[3068.78s -> 3070.62s]  Nope. You've got to do animal style with
[3070.82s -> 3074.46s]  grilled onions and make sure that they put it in a to go box.
[3075.80s -> 3077.40s]  Just why do I have to order this thing
[3077.40s -> 3079.68s]  so special to make it taste the way that it's supposed to be?
[3080.95s -> 3083.19s]  Like every time you talk to somebody that loves in and out, they tell you,
[3083.19s -> 3084.87s]  don't order fucking anything off the menu.
[3084.87s -> 3085.83s]  You have to change everything.
[3090.01s -> 3094.86s]  But I'll tell you, I ordered a burger with the grilled onions in it,
[3095.06s -> 3099.38s]  take out box and I sat there and I ate it and I said, holy shit,
[3099.58s -> 3104.70s]  this is fucking really, really good, way better than the default burger
[3104.70s -> 3107.56s]  that you just order off the menu, way better.
[3108.06s -> 3110.02s]  And I mean, like, probably like a hundred times better.
[3114.56s -> 3116.08s]  So I'm going to.
[3117.22s -> 3118.10s]  OK, you ready?
[3120.46s -> 3121.70s]  In and out is going up here.
[3121.90s -> 3128.65s]  But then it's being it's being like it's being like changed, right?
[3128.65s -> 3130.01s]  Like it's up here. Then it comes down here.
[3132.11s -> 3134.07s]  This is like the hold on.
[3134.27s -> 3135.55s]  This is this is fucked up.
[3135.75s -> 3138.26s]  Like this can't be here. Neither can this.
[3138.77s -> 3147.47s]  Neither can that. Your pressure chain.
[3147.67s -> 3152.43s]  No, I'm just telling you that I I finally ate in and out the way that I was told
[3152.63s -> 3157.18s]  I was supposed to quote order special the burger and it was better than just
[3157.18s -> 3162.70s]  ordering it off the menu, which makes me want to put it down here.
[3165.06s -> 3167.98s]  Even animal style dick.
[3189.02s -> 3192.34s]  And this is another place that's fucking crowded all the time.
[3192.54s -> 3195.06s]  It's just like, look, if I'm hungry and I want
[3195.10s -> 3200.51s]  like a quick burger or something like time to go sit in an in and out like 10
[3200.71s -> 3204.27s]  to 15 minutes, sometimes that line is like as the same as like Chick-fil-A.
[3213.22s -> 3214.22s]  I want to make this clear.
[3214.42s -> 3216.58s]  I don't think in and out is bad.
[3216.78s -> 3217.78s]  I think it's good.
[3218.22s -> 3226.38s]  But the process to get it to be good is a little irritating to me and wrap the
[3226.38s -> 3228.42s]  burgers up like every fucking other restaurant does.
[3228.62s -> 3230.54s]  Every other restaurant does this.
[3230.74s -> 3233.30s]  If it was like one or two other places did this, it's fine.
[3233.50s -> 3237.98s]  Every single fast food burger place does not have your burger.
[3238.18s -> 3241.38s]  Out in the open in the bag to wrap the burger up.
[3241.38s -> 3243.18s]  I don't care what I don't care.
[3243.18s -> 3244.34s]  Just please put it in a wrapper.
[3244.38s -> 3245.78s]  Let me wrap it and put it in the bag, please.
[3254.98s -> 3256.42s]  Fuck out of here.
[3258.85s -> 3260.01s]  Jack in the box.
[3262.69s -> 3264.09s]  Why is in and out before McDonald's?
[3264.29s -> 3266.37s]  Because that's where it is.
[3269.37s -> 3271.85s]  If you want a wrapper, you ask for the takeout box.
[3274.46s -> 3281.30s]  If you're driving in your car and they give you a cardboard box,
[3281.50s -> 3285.78s]  that's like this cardboard fucking shoe box that you're supposed to.
[3285.90s -> 3287.46s]  I want a bag.
[3287.96s -> 3292.40s]  I don't want like this cardboard box that like somebody has to fucking hold like this.
[3292.60s -> 3293.52s]  I want a bag.
[3293.72s -> 3294.88s]  Put it in a bag and wrap it.
[3306.14s -> 3307.94s]  It's a box in a bag.
[3308.14s -> 3314.90s]  Why don't you just put it in a bag?
[3320.27s -> 3327.27s]  Like Joe McDonald figured this out in like 1910 or whatever the fuck this was.
[3327.47s -> 3330.83s]  He figured this out in like the fucking 1800s.
[3331.03s -> 3332.67s]  When McDonald's opened for the first time,
[3332.79s -> 3336.19s]  you just like wrap it in a little bit of paper and you give it to the customer.
[3338.32s -> 3339.44s]  I'm not going to stay on this.
[3339.56s -> 3340.92s]  Just know I like the taste.
[3340.92s -> 3341.84s]  I think it's fucking good.
[3342.04s -> 3353.56s]  But I have but but but but the Simpsons.
[3355.02s -> 3362.37s]  Wait, did we do this already? Hold on.
[3362.57s -> 3363.77s]  Sim I'm freaking out.
[3363.97s -> 3368.07s]  Simpsons intro.
[3368.27s -> 3373.55s]  Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't.
[3376.49s -> 3377.57s]  I'm done.
[3377.77s -> 3379.05s]  Don't don't don't.
[3379.25s -> 3384.99s]  I'm loving it. That's weird.
[3388.70s -> 3390.90s]  What is Jack's? Is Jack's not Jack in the Box?
[3399.21s -> 3400.45s]  Oh, is this the same?
[3405.24s -> 3407.04s]  You can see the insanity in his eyes.
[3415.54s -> 3417.18s]  Why do you like your burger mushed to shit?
[3417.38s -> 3426.01s]  I just I OK, if I eat in the restaurant in and out, I I need to be fair.
[3426.77s -> 3430.73s]  I cannot remember the last time that I
[3430.93s -> 3433.97s]  went into a fast food restaurant to sit down and eat there.
[3434.73s -> 3437.53s]  It's been I can't even remember when I did that last.
[3440.46s -> 3443.86s]  I knew I was going to have to defend this to the new viewers here.
[3449.42s -> 3454.32s]  Hey, Paul, I don't this is not Jack in the Box.
[3454.32s -> 3455.16s]  I don't know what it is.
[3455.36s -> 3458.47s]  I've never had Jamba Juice.
[3458.67s -> 3463.79s]  No, Jason's Deli is just Panera Bread with a different name.
[3464.42s -> 3470.42s]  I mean, that's just kind of how I see it.
[3480.07s -> 3482.11s]  Jason's Deli is for men.
[3486.33s -> 3488.45s]  What do you mean it's for men?
[3489.78s -> 3491.66s]  What is like is like the number one at
[3491.86s -> 3497.62s]  Jason's Deli like a steak sandwich with a beer and it comes with a free lawnmower
[3497.82s -> 3500.34s]  coupon. What do you mean for men?
[3501.29s -> 3502.77s]  Does it come with like aftershave?
[3502.97s -> 3512.52s]  What are you talking about? It comes.
[3516.86s -> 3518.14s]  I've had it before.
[3518.34s -> 3520.06s]  It's I thought it was good.
[3520.06s -> 3525.74s]  I thought I mean, I don't know if I'd put it like up into like our coveted in and out here.
[3530.73s -> 3533.37s]  And I don't know if I'd rather probably just go to OK.
[3538.42s -> 3539.94s]  I ate at a restaurant. Is this weird?
[3540.14s -> 3542.82s]  This is kind of a completely off topic story.
[3544.15s -> 3546.63s]  I ate at I feel like people like I don't know.
[3547.52s -> 3550.30s]  I ate at a restaurant one time and then I walked.
[3550.30s -> 3556.10s]  I finished my full meal at this restaurant and there was a Baskin Robbins right next
[3556.10s -> 3558.86s]  to it connected to this place, connected to the restaurant.
[3560.28s -> 3562.88s]  And I walked out of the restaurant.
[3563.08s -> 3564.72s]  I had a full meal. I was full.
[3564.92s -> 3566.24s]  It was a lot of food. Right.
[3566.94s -> 3570.22s]  And I walked out and like in to the Baskin Robbins.
[3571.42s -> 3573.02s]  And like I felt like it was I don't know.
[3573.06s -> 3574.22s]  Something was weird about it.
[3575.43s -> 3579.03s]  Like I walked out and then in and they came up with a big ice cream.
[3579.03s -> 3581.27s]  And I don't know. I feel like the workers are probably just like,
[3581.71s -> 3583.91s]  holy shit, this guy's fucking hungry.
[3584.29s -> 3587.05s]  This dude got like a large big ice cream.
[3587.25s -> 3588.93s]  He just had like a full dinner.
[3595.96s -> 3597.32s]  He had the munchies.
[3597.52s -> 3598.88s]  But it was I don't know.
[3599.04s -> 3601.00s]  Because it was immediately after I finished.
[3601.70s -> 3603.38s]  It was like, thank you.
[3603.58s -> 3605.78s]  Now, that was great. Thank you.
[3607.56s -> 3613.52s]  In the other door,
[3613.72s -> 3616.24s]  Jersey Mike's or what I like to call this place,
[3616.44s -> 3619.36s]  Oregano Mike's, because it's on every sandwich.
[3620.18s -> 3622.26s]  I actually not that big of a fan of this place.
[3622.46s -> 3633.10s]  It's good.
[3635.98s -> 3637.74s]  It's just Oregano Subway.
[3643.55s -> 3647.95s]  Yeah, I definitely I was definitely better than like fucking.
[3648.15s -> 3649.87s]  It's probably better than Arby's.
[3654.73s -> 3657.05s]  I had a turkey sandwich from this place
[3657.05s -> 3660.50s]  before, and it was like, that was fine.
[3660.70s -> 3662.38s]  It was just too much oregano on it.
[3662.58s -> 3666.32s]  I think I ordered it the wrong way.
[3666.52s -> 3669.02s]  It was fine.
[3669.22s -> 3672.91s]  Not like, oh, wow.
[3674.60s -> 3678.50s]  I would probably rather go to Firehouse than Jersey Mike's.
[3678.70s -> 3679.66s]  Jimmy John's.
[3680.48s -> 3690.20s]  These are just the same place in my brain.
[3690.40s -> 3693.12s]  I cannot distinguish between the two of these in my head,
[3699.51s -> 3702.20s]  but I should be able to. Right.
[3702.40s -> 3711.50s]  I feel like if I have to remember like the few times I've had both of these,
[3711.70s -> 3713.34s]  I don't know. I just don't know.
[3719.26s -> 3722.02s]  Johnny Rockets. Oh, man.
[3726.62s -> 3727.98s]  I got boogers coming out of my nose, I think.
[3727.98s -> 3728.90s]  Just be aware.
[3729.92s -> 3731.12s]  Johnny Rockets is good.
[3731.94s -> 3733.62s]  But how good? That's the question.
[3740.02s -> 3742.42s]  Keep in mind, I ate at this restaurant last time.
[3742.62s -> 3746.24s]  I ate at it. I was probably 11.
[3748.34s -> 3751.06s]  So I don't know how much of an opinion I can form here.
[3759.70s -> 3765.11s]  Eat your boogers, booger boy.
[3767.72s -> 3769.16s]  I cannot speak to it.
[3769.36s -> 3773.88s]  And unfortunately, if I haven't had it in over 10 plus years, it has to go down here.
[3773.92s -> 3774.72s]  It just does.
[3776.98s -> 3779.22s]  Jollibee is a really interesting place.
[3779.42s -> 3783.10s]  Jollibee is one of the only like fast food restaurants that has like fucking
[3783.30s -> 3787.54s]  spaghetti. It was like, holy shit, what?
[3797.51s -> 3799.27s]  I've had it a couple of times and I like it.
[3806.82s -> 3808.26s]  That doesn't mean it's good.
[3808.82s -> 3810.34s]  Well, now, why am I? I'm too bright now.
[3810.54s -> 3811.26s]  What happened here?
[3820.15s -> 3827.70s]  OK, um, I don't remember being like, holy shit, this is good.
[3827.70s -> 3829.86s]  Five guys should not be here and neither should Chick-fil-A.
[3830.06s -> 3831.56s]  McDonald's should be here.
[3831.76s -> 3832.56s]  Oh, my God, German.
[3832.76s -> 3834.08s]  Oh, my God, based.
[3834.28s -> 3835.08s]  Yeah, thanks.
[3844.48s -> 3845.68s]  Was that one guy in the chat that said
[3845.76s -> 3847.12s]  that he was going to be mad if I did this?
[3847.32s -> 3853.10s]  I like this place.
[3854.94s -> 3856.42s]  You know, it sucks about KFC.
[3857.57s -> 3861.61s]  Doesn't it suck being the only person in the group of your group of friends that
[3861.61s -> 3865.09s]  recommends this place and wants to go, but nobody else does ever.
[3868.79s -> 3870.83s]  What do you want to get for food, guys?
[3871.03s -> 3873.35s]  Oh, you know, let's think about it.
[3873.55s -> 3874.43s]  KFC is around.
[3874.63s -> 3876.79s]  There's a KFC. We could go to KFC.
[3877.81s -> 3879.85s]  No, no, yeah, we could.
[3879.85s -> 3881.05s]  But we could go here. We could go here.
[3881.25s -> 3882.57s]  OK, we're not going.
[3882.77s -> 3886.25s]  It's like I feel like I'm the only person that ever recommends to ever go here.
[3886.84s -> 3889.00s]  Like ever in all my groups I've ever been in.
[3890.53s -> 3893.37s]  So I don't get to have it that often because it's like it's hard.
[3893.57s -> 3900.44s]  OK, when I think of going to KFC, I think of you get like all the sides.
[3900.64s -> 3902.08s]  You get the bucket of chicken.
[3902.28s -> 3904.32s]  You get all the biscuits.
[3904.52s -> 3907.80s]  I don't really would want to go to KFC to order like just one little thing.
[3909.52s -> 3912.04s]  I only want to go to KFC if I get like the whole spread.
[3918.37s -> 3919.09s]  But I like it.
[3919.29s -> 3920.41s]  I do.
[3922.70s -> 3924.30s]  Their mashed potatoes are great.
[3924.30s -> 3925.90s]  Their macaroni and cheese is awesome.
[3926.06s -> 3929.22s]  The corn, I love that watery ass corn, don't you?
[3929.86s -> 3930.94s]  God, I love it.
[3931.82s -> 3934.70s]  I try to deliberately get the water in my mouth.
[3934.70s -> 3936.82s]  I deliberately try to get like the liquid.
[3937.39s -> 3938.35s]  Oh, I love it.
[3945.32s -> 3947.56s]  I'm sitting here thinking about like that watery ass corn.
[3947.76s -> 3948.72s]  And I want it up here.
[3949.80s -> 3952.80s]  But this is like just kind of like I haven't eaten today.
[3953.30s -> 3954.02s]  I've not eaten.
[3954.98s -> 3957.30s]  So right now you are this.
[3957.30s -> 3958.50s]  I'm just realizing what's going on.
[3960.02s -> 3962.94s]  I'm rating these based on what I want like tonight for dinner.
[3963.14s -> 3964.26s]  Not about how good they are.
[3966.30s -> 3968.22s]  I want that fucking watery corn tonight.
[3971.25s -> 3972.49s]  So that's happening.
[3978.11s -> 3979.95s]  OK, Krispy Kreme.
[3980.15s -> 3982.23s]  I mean, this is like the meme.
[3984.40s -> 3985.16s]  It's good.
[3985.36s -> 3989.18s]  I mean, it's good.
[3989.38s -> 3990.74s]  How good, though?
[3995.66s -> 3999.90s]  I remember biting into a Krispy Kreme donut and before I could chew, it was gone.
[4001.50s -> 4003.38s]  And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[4007.40s -> 4009.96s]  It was like it's like a cotton candy of donuts.
[4011.62s -> 4012.62s]  It's just gone.
[4022.85s -> 4026.73s]  This is kind of unfair, though, because Krispy Kreme just does one like meme
[4026.73s -> 4030.01s]  thing where it's like the Krispy Kreme, delicious, yummy Krispy Kreme, sugary
[4030.13s -> 4031.29s]  melts in your mouth donut.
[4031.29s -> 4034.73s]  But I would I'm not going to go to Krispy Kreme instead of firehouse subs.
[4034.77s -> 4036.13s]  It's a different world.
[4043.16s -> 4044.44s]  I'm going to keep it here for now.
[4045.14s -> 4046.46s]  I've never had this.
[4047.92s -> 4051.88s]  I am I haven't had this in probably since I was probably like 12.
[4052.26s -> 4053.78s]  But I but I like the little guy.
[4053.98s -> 4055.38s]  So he's going up here.
[4056.46s -> 4058.30s]  I've not had long drawn silvers.
[4058.50s -> 4059.78s]  I've never had Marcos.
[4059.98s -> 4065.31s]  I've never had the Callister's mod.
[4066.65s -> 4072.03s]  Mo's Mo's is Mo's is fucking good.
[4073.02s -> 4076.37s]  Mo's is way better, way better.
[4076.57s -> 4078.09s]  But it's been a long time.
[4079.55s -> 4081.23s]  Mo's is better than Chipotle.
[4082.12s -> 4083.52s]  It is. It's far better.
[4083.72s -> 4084.72s]  It's far superior.
[4089.90s -> 4091.54s]  I mean, my face, why am I so blown out?
[4091.54s -> 4092.90s]  Where's this light coming from?
[4102.74s -> 4103.86s]  Heavily disagree.
[4105.26s -> 4109.10s]  You know, I honestly, if you think Mo's is better than Chipotle, like that to me,
[4109.30s -> 4114.99s]  to hear somebody say that to me, that's like, oh, OK, you and I are on the same
[4115.19s -> 4120.89s]  page based like that's my based for me.
[4121.65s -> 4123.33s]  If you say Chipotle is better than Mo's,
[4123.33s -> 4126.94s]  it's like, oh, you and I are not going to get along.
[4127.44s -> 4128.72s]  We're just not at all.
[4128.92s -> 4130.80s]  I mean, we may just delete my number from your phone.
[4130.88s -> 4131.92s]  Like, we're not going to hang up.
[4140.04s -> 4141.96s]  I keep saying based.
[4141.96s -> 4145.04s]  I don't know why it's just like it's in the brain now.
[4146.57s -> 4150.49s]  Oh, I know why it's because the light's not on in this room.
[4153.36s -> 4155.68s]  I was wondering, like, why does it look so weird in here?
[4160.15s -> 4165.56s]  I'm sitting kind of in like a dark room and I didn't realize it.
[4165.76s -> 4167.08s]  Now it looks like normal.
[4167.08s -> 4168.40s]  OK, that was weird.
[4175.56s -> 4179.33s]  There we go. OK, what are you guys saying?
[4185.34s -> 4190.70s]  Noodles and Express.
[4190.90s -> 4192.06s]  Wait, what did I just put up?
[4192.06s -> 4194.10s]  I put something. Where did what was it? Oh, Little Caesars.
[4194.30s -> 4199.54s]  OK, Panda Express is hard.
[4201.26s -> 4202.74s]  This is not Panda Express.
[4205.74s -> 4212.38s]  Anyways, it is. What else?
[4212.58s -> 4214.82s]  Yeah. What are you talking about?
[4216.67s -> 4218.03s]  There's another panda.
[4219.82s -> 4221.66s]  Stop ignoring us. What are you talking about?
[4223.82s -> 4228.91s]  I don't think I've I think I ate.
[4229.11s -> 4230.75s]  I tried it off somebody's plate.
[4231.19s -> 4233.23s]  Somebody ordered it and I was like, oh, I'll try it.
[4233.76s -> 4237.08s]  I ate like one piece of chicken, but that I've not I've never really eaten it.
[4237.52s -> 4243.03s]  I haven't. Did you forget about the phenomenal tier?
[4243.03s -> 4245.16s]  No, I just need to make sure that stuff
[4245.16s -> 4247.72s]  that goes up there is stuff that I absolutely am certain of.
[4247.92s -> 4249.24s]  And then some of those might move.
[4249.24s -> 4253.96s]  So we're going to move a lot of the shit around this Panera.
[4255.68s -> 4256.84s]  There is. All right.
[4259.84s -> 4262.28s]  I do like cheddar broccoli soup and a bread bowl.
[4263.94s -> 4267.54s]  As much as people want to talk about Panera, you got to remember something.
[4267.74s -> 4272.29s]  Panera was like the first restaurant to really do shit like that.
[4273.18s -> 4275.42s]  Wait, I can get like soup and a bread bowl.
[4275.42s -> 4277.94s]  Like nobody did that shit like 10, 20 years ago.
[4282.60s -> 4284.92s]  So they kind of paved the way for a lot
[4285.12s -> 4294.52s]  of these restaurants that you see now. It's hospital food.
[4297.33s -> 4304.11s]  If you really think that friendlies is better, like what is friendlies then?
[4304.94s -> 4316.45s]  What would you consider friendlies to be in this scenario? Quality.
[4318.04s -> 4320.62s]  OK, it's all right.
[4320.66s -> 4321.62s]  It's better. I'll fix it.
[4321.62s -> 4323.58s]  But it's I don't think it's like great. I think it's good.
[4323.58s -> 4327.48s]  I've had it a bunch of times. Papa John's.
[4327.64s -> 4329.04s]  I think I've had once.
[4333.38s -> 4334.98s]  I think about it one time.
[4336.19s -> 4340.81s]  I don't like I haven't like had it.
[4341.01s -> 4344.37s]  I don't I don't really order from very many pizza chains.
[4344.37s -> 4347.65s]  Like I said before, if there's a local place that I would get it.
[4348.92s -> 4350.24s]  So it's not even on the list.
[4351.00s -> 4356.30s]  I don't eat it off of Papa Murphy.
[4357.25s -> 4366.10s]  East Coast subs, Peter Pitt Pizza Hut goes way up here because it has the stuff
[4366.10s -> 4370.82s]  crust and everybody, all these all these other pretenders that did stuff crust.
[4371.39s -> 4372.83s]  It's not even remotely the same.
[4373.62s -> 4375.18s]  It's not even fucking close.
[4376.13s -> 4377.69s]  Stuff crust pizza from Pizza Hut.
[4377.69s -> 4379.17s]  I don't know what they put in that crust.
[4379.17s -> 4380.09s]  I don't know what they do to it.
[4380.98s -> 4383.32s]  I love it. I love it so much.
[4383.44s -> 4385.96s]  And other people have tried to imitate and it's just not even close.
[4394.59s -> 4395.87s]  But it should be up here.
[4397.02s -> 4399.70s]  The only thing I order at the whole restaurant, nothing else.
[4401.74s -> 4403.74s]  You're tripping. Pizza Hut is garbage.
[4405.46s -> 4406.98s]  Have you had the stuff crust pizza?
[4406.98s -> 4409.22s]  Have you had a stuff crust pepperoni pizza from Pizza Hut?
[4409.42s -> 4411.34s]  I understand your concerns here.
[4411.90s -> 4414.58s]  Have you ever gone, I know, like, oh, I had a pizza at Pizza Hut.
[4414.78s -> 4415.92s]  It sucked. Yes.
[4416.32s -> 4417.08s]  Answer my question.
[4417.65s -> 4421.97s]  Have you ever had a stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut?
[4422.98s -> 4427.00s]  If you have not, you need to rethink it a little bit.
[4430.26s -> 4435.13s]  Even if you hate Pizza Hut, it's the only thing that is on the menu that I order.
[4435.63s -> 4438.59s]  It's just like Taco Bell and Taco Bell.
[4439.35s -> 4441.31s]  Let's just put it up there because I'm going to.
[4441.31s -> 4442.71s]  Right. Like, let's just do it.
[4442.91s -> 4446.35s]  Let's do it now because this is where it belongs.
[4447.50s -> 4453.66s]  The Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the single best menu item on any fast food
[4453.70s -> 4457.86s]  restaurant that has ever come out across every country on earth.
[4459.58s -> 4465.14s]  Everything else at Taco Bell can suck, can be disgusting and worthless.
[4465.22s -> 4466.18s]  It does not matter.
[4466.22s -> 4467.58s]  It doesn't fucking matter.
[4467.74s -> 4468.54s]  It doesn't matter.
[4469.11s -> 4472.59s]  Cheesy Gordita Crunch puts this up here just on its own.
[4472.59s -> 4476.81s]  It carries the whole rest of the team, the entire team.
[4479.49s -> 4484.74s]  The Cheesy Gordita Crunch scored like a hundred points in the basketball game.
[4484.74s -> 4487.06s]  And everybody else on the team was sleeping on the court.
[4488.26s -> 4489.86s]  They still won the game, didn't they?
[4490.06s -> 4499.01s]  Doesn't matter. It has to be there.
[4499.13s -> 4507.21s]  Quidditch and team fucking Gryffindor won that match.
[4511.55s -> 4515.19s]  Quidditch. Taco Bell, I fucking love this place.
[4516.14s -> 4518.66s]  There are times when I know I've eaten
[4518.86s -> 4524.39s]  Taco Bell yesterday and I sit there and I go, fuck it, I'm doing it again.
[4525.98s -> 4533.97s]  Doesn't happen that often, but it is the only place that I will reliably say I
[4534.17s -> 4537.29s]  would eat that instead of the local Mexican restaurants.
[4537.66s -> 4538.58s]  It's the only one.
[4539.98s -> 4541.50s]  It's the only exception.
[4544.12s -> 4548.68s]  Local Mexican restaurants are so good and you put Taco Bell up in S tier.
[4549.14s -> 4560.29s]  I have very, very specific reasons why, though, very specific that oh, especially
[4560.49s -> 4563.77s]  holy shit, if you get the Doritos taco, if you get the
[4563.97s -> 4567.45s]  you want to talk about this shit goes up, this shit goes into the stratosphere.
[4567.65s -> 4568.97s]  This is like aliens.
[4569.17s -> 4570.45s]  Aliens wouldn't even see this.
[4570.45s -> 4572.33s]  It's going to go so high into the goddamn cosmos.
[4572.53s -> 4576.33s]  If you put the Doritos Locos Taco in the Cheesy Gordita Crunch,
[4577.79s -> 4579.87s]  it can't even be on the list anymore. It'd be gone.
[4581.08s -> 4583.16s]  You would think I removed it. In fact, we should take it off.
[4590.06s -> 4591.77s]  I haven't had it ever.
[4591.89s -> 4593.05s]  And I always say I want it.
[4594.45s -> 4595.57s]  I say I always want it.
[4595.57s -> 4596.89s]  I always say I want it.
[4599.06s -> 4600.26s]  But I've never gotten it. I've never eaten it.
[4602.30s -> 4607.97s]  And I really do feel like if I had if I did eat it, that it would probably be up here.
[4608.17s -> 4610.89s]  I've seen like I've seen other people eat it.
[4610.93s -> 4612.49s]  I've seen like commercials.
[4612.69s -> 4614.65s]  I'm just like, holy shit, that's right up my alley.
[4615.60s -> 4616.56s]  I've never eaten it.
[4617.70s -> 4618.98s]  They have the fries you like.
[4619.18s -> 4619.82s]  Are you serious?
[4626.09s -> 4627.53s]  Wait a minute. Explain it to me.
[4628.29s -> 4629.73s]  What are the fries like it?
[4641.05s -> 4641.81s]  Are you kidding me?
[4642.89s -> 4645.85s]  Are these the fries that are these the actual fries that I like?
[4646.67s -> 4647.71s]  Oh, my God, they are, aren't they?
[4653.72s -> 4655.48s]  I mean, this night I'm going to get it tonight.
[4657.74s -> 4661.86s]  Yeah, I Popeye's fries and go to images.
[4662.88s -> 4663.68s]  Holy shit.
[4663.68s -> 4664.84s]  This is exactly what I want.
[4665.04s -> 4666.24s]  This is the exact thing.
[4666.44s -> 4670.04s]  The orange French fry and they're crunchy and they're crispy.
[4671.63s -> 4672.51s]  Holy shit.
[4672.71s -> 4674.39s]  This is precisely what I want.
[4674.96s -> 4676.60s]  All right. This is going up. This is going up here.
[4676.64s -> 4678.00s]  I don't even care if I've ever eaten it.
[4678.20s -> 4682.28s]  It's going up here because like it just has the it has the absolute best French fry
[4682.28s -> 4683.64s]  you could possibly want. It's going up there.
[4683.84s -> 4685.24s]  I don't even I know what those taste like.
[4685.44s -> 4686.20s]  I can put it up here.
[4691.76s -> 4693.08s]  Holy shit. It's unbelievable.
[4699.54s -> 4700.34s]  Let me show you.
[4706.34s -> 4712.79s]  So you hear this is what I was talking about.
[4718.03s -> 4718.51s]  Where is it?
[4728.42s -> 4730.66s]  That is exactly what I want.
[4733.41s -> 4734.57s]  I know what they taste like.
[4739.87s -> 4742.99s]  Is it where I know the exact sound that those make, too.
[4743.62s -> 4745.14s]  It's like
[4748.78s -> 4752.93s]  Popeye's is going up here because I know what those taste like.
[4756.57s -> 4757.25s]  Let's continue.
[4759.16s -> 4762.97s]  We're for two lows hot belly.
[4764.69s -> 4767.01s]  I think I've only I've only had to do it once.
[4768.60s -> 4769.24s]  This nose.
[4769.44s -> 4772.92s]  Oh, man, the honey bacon club from Quiznos puts this up here.
[4774.19s -> 4776.99s]  But it's I have not had it in a long time.
[4782.00s -> 4782.96s]  They even have this quiz nose.
[4783.04s -> 4792.86s]  Did Quiznos go to business about moving McDonald's?
[4792.86s -> 4793.90s]  It's it's dynamic.
[4793.90s -> 4794.70s]  It's going to be moving around.
[4794.70s -> 4796.10s]  I have to make sure it's in the right place.
[4797.18s -> 4798.50s]  Quiznos is bankrupt.
[4802.40s -> 4803.80s]  What a fucking unfair world.
[4804.00s -> 4808.12s]  What an unfair world that Quiznos has to go away.
[4808.32s -> 4812.16s]  But Subway continues to be on every other street corner.
[4812.86s -> 4813.90s]  What world are we in?
[4815.62s -> 4818.50s]  Why? That seems so unbelievably unfair.
[4818.50s -> 4820.38s]  And because of that, it's going up and asked here.
[4821.20s -> 4822.40s]  That's I can't believe it.
[4823.48s -> 4824.40s]  That place is incredible.
[4824.44s -> 4827.08s]  It was the best fast food sub place I've ever had.
[4831.62s -> 4832.34s]  What happened?
[4835.14s -> 4838.73s]  Canes, Canes is very, very good.
[4839.68s -> 4841.04s]  Canes is very good.
[4841.74s -> 4844.02s]  And Canes, in fact, is probably going up here.
[4857.51s -> 4860.79s]  I would absolutely rather have Canes than anything on this list.
[4861.81s -> 4863.21s]  Yeah, I think so.
[4866.14s -> 4867.54s]  It might even level up here.
[4867.74s -> 4868.74s]  It's possible.
[4870.66s -> 4872.50s]  Canes is the best fast food restaurant.
[4872.50s -> 4876.90s]  Well, it's one of them because it's obviously top four right now.
[4877.10s -> 4881.86s]  I can't Boston Market cannot be in my top five favorite fast food restaurants.
[4881.86s -> 4884.38s]  I haven't had it in like fucking 10 years.
[4884.82s -> 4886.14s]  It's going because of that reason.
[4886.14s -> 4886.98s]  It's going down here.
[4898.10s -> 4899.46s]  It gets hometown advantage.
[4899.66s -> 4903.70s]  Yeah, I can't know.
[4903.90s -> 4908.02s]  Reader Rita's Roy Rogers.
[4908.02s -> 4909.50s]  I just know the drink Roy Rogers.
[4909.50s -> 4910.46s]  I've never eaten there.
[4910.90s -> 4911.58s]  So borrows.
[4911.58s -> 4914.34s]  This is the pizza that you see at every airport and every mall.
[4914.54s -> 4916.85s]  It's OK. I think it's all right.
[4917.05s -> 4918.49s]  I would say it's better than Pizza Hut.
[4924.56s -> 4925.20s]  We'll see.
[4927.62s -> 4928.34s]  Shake Shack.
[4928.54s -> 4933.54s]  I remember Shake Shack was in S tier the last time I did this.
[4933.58s -> 4935.30s]  I said Shake Shack was the best burger
[4935.50s -> 4937.86s]  of any restaurant like fast food or other that I've had.
[4939.78s -> 4944.61s]  But I need to I need to update it and update it.
[4947.80s -> 4949.24s]  This is dropped for me.
[4950.45s -> 4951.93s]  It's still very good.
[4952.88s -> 4957.62s]  But the last few times I've had it, something changed.
[4958.83s -> 4959.51s]  It was OK.
[4959.71s -> 4963.39s]  It was it was very much like, OK, I mean, it was very, very good.
[4965.11s -> 4967.91s]  But something's something's different about it last year or two.
[4968.11s -> 4971.12s]  I don't know. It's dropping.
[4971.32s -> 4975.59s]  It came down.
[4975.79s -> 4977.98s]  Sheets never had it.
[4979.06s -> 4979.90s]  Smash Burger.
[4979.94s -> 4982.22s]  I want it, but I've never had it.
[4982.91s -> 4983.95s]  Smoothie King.
[4984.15s -> 4984.99s]  I don't think I ever had it.
[4985.37s -> 4987.85s]  Sonic is fucking horrible.
[4988.05s -> 4988.65s]  It's horrible.
[4990.62s -> 4995.26s]  All the wonderful drinks at Sonic try desperately to push this up here.
[4995.77s -> 5000.82s]  But when you eat like for the fifth time in a row, just cold food,
[5000.82s -> 5002.54s]  it's just like no fucking stay down there.
[5007.02s -> 5009.02s]  I'm going I'm I'm not kidding.
[5009.22s -> 5012.82s]  This is not I'm not trying to say anything bad, but I have to be honest.
[5013.77s -> 5017.05s]  I have never had hot food from Sonic.
[5017.13s -> 5020.05s]  I've only had it like four or five times, maybe in my life.
[5020.81s -> 5026.50s]  It is I have never had food that was even remotely warm from this place ever.
[5026.88s -> 5028.08s]  Not one time.
[5029.10s -> 5032.90s]  It cannot it's not even if the food is good, it's not allowed to be up there.
[5039.80s -> 5041.20s]  You only get drinks at Sonic.
[5041.40s -> 5045.41s]  OK, can we split Sonic into two different companies?
[5045.85s -> 5048.73s]  Can it be like Sonic Food and Sonic Drink?
[5048.93s -> 5054.44s]  Because Sonic Drink is like up here.
[5054.64s -> 5058.48s]  Sonic Drink is probably somewhere up up in this area, I'd say at least.
[5060.10s -> 5062.78s]  But the whole rest of the whole restaurant is fucking awful.
[5065.71s -> 5067.79s]  In fact, I think Sonic could probably save
[5067.99s -> 5071.91s]  a bunch of money and like redo their whole business as just being like a dessert
[5071.91s -> 5075.82s]  drive thru place. I feel like way more people would care.
[5079.08s -> 5080.28s]  Add more like desserts.
[5080.28s -> 5082.60s]  Have it be like a cool dessert drink drive thru place.
[5086.11s -> 5090.52s]  Because if it was just that, it's up here.
[5090.52s -> 5091.60s]  It really is. It's good.
[5092.42s -> 5093.90s]  But I cannot give that rating.
[5093.90s -> 5095.18s]  It's not fair to do that.
[5100.17s -> 5102.29s]  The drinks are like a tier.
[5102.49s -> 5103.77s]  Everything else.
[5105.42s -> 5107.50s]  This place sucks, too.
[5111.55s -> 5116.95s]  Have I become like a coffee, like snob or something?
[5117.15s -> 5126.33s]  Like I, again, over expansion, right?
[5128.56s -> 5131.28s]  Starbucks has got this is OK.
[5131.66s -> 5137.02s]  Starbucks has gotten to the point where there are so many of them that they're now
[5137.22s -> 5145.10s]  infiltrating grocery stores, targets, like malls, like what?
[5146.18s -> 5149.38s]  They have five locations in a mile radius.
[5149.58s -> 5150.46s]  That's not enough.
[5150.46s -> 5155.02s]  They need to be in your they need to be in your target in your grocery store,
[5155.22s -> 5157.54s]  in your gas station.
[5157.54s -> 5158.86s]  Like, why do they have to be?
[5158.98s -> 5160.62s]  Why do you have to be in so many places?
[5160.82s -> 5170.32s]  Why like when I go to like a target, it's just like there's a Starbucks in here.
[5171.14s -> 5173.94s]  It is just attached itself to every single other business.
[5176.56s -> 5177.44s]  Relax.
[5178.01s -> 5179.41s]  All right. All right.
[5179.61s -> 5180.49s]  All right. I'm going to relax.
[5180.49s -> 5182.62s]  All right. In your house.
[5182.62s -> 5186.06s]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if one day I just like walked out of my bedroom
[5186.22s -> 5190.50s]  and there was a kiosk over here, just sitting like in the hallway.
[5191.90s -> 5193.45s]  What can I get you?
[5193.65s -> 5196.93s]  Um, I don't I fucking don't want a Starbucks right now.
[5198.90s -> 5201.94s]  I'm going to go down to the bathroom and like use the bathroom and like wash my
[5202.14s -> 5205.14s]  hands and like fucking coffee is going to come out of the faucet.
[5206.16s -> 5208.32s]  And this is going to be a counter, like a money counter.
[5208.32s -> 5209.44s]  Just
[5210.28s -> 5213.16s]  of how much money I'm spending by using my own fucking toilet.
[5213.36s -> 5216.20s]  I'm going to flush the toilet and like coffee is going to go down the toilet.
[5222.27s -> 5225.98s]  Starbucks, I've had it many, many times.
[5227.14s -> 5233.19s]  But holy shit, it does like it's in too many places.
[5233.63s -> 5235.63s]  It's so it's too much.
[5238.31s -> 5241.27s]  That's not coffee, dude, that's poo poo.
[5250.22s -> 5259.33s]  All I'm saying is when you expand so much that like when you can't what happens
[5259.53s -> 5265.35s]  when you can't expand anymore, there's a point where there's no longer
[5265.55s -> 5272.70s]  any further you can go there in every fucking store you then you win.
[5274.35s -> 5276.11s]  So it's like it's Starbucks going to go
[5276.11s -> 5279.11s]  on to like the Nasdaq or whatever, like one of these days and just like
[5279.31s -> 5284.56s]  smash the gavel and be like, boom, we won, we win.
[5285.70s -> 5288.68s]  And then they're going to just take the D list, the stock.
[5288.88s -> 5290.88s]  You know what the fuck is going to happen?
[5292.22s -> 5294.02s]  I just want everyone to know that, yeah,
[5294.22s -> 5297.90s]  Starbucks, we are in every single location, we're in everybody's house.
[5298.10s -> 5300.42s]  We're attached to everybody's skateboards and bicycles.
[5300.62s -> 5304.22s]  We have a nozzle on the back of your hose on the back of your house.
[5304.42s -> 5305.42s]  We win.
[5307.16s -> 5309.56s]  And then they'll move on to do something else.
[5309.76s -> 5314.21s]  And it'll be you're going to it's going to be like fucking Starbucks Prime.
[5315.29s -> 5316.53s]  I got to get Starbucks Prime.
[5316.53s -> 5318.33s]  Yeah, they're going to ship me my fucking like
[5318.53s -> 5320.69s]  they're going to ship me my fucking deodorant that I ordered.
[5320.69s -> 5322.25s]  They're going to start to get in the shipping business.
[5332.80s -> 5333.76s]  The coffee's OK.
[5342.26s -> 5344.70s]  I thought you meant like like Optimus Prime.
[5344.90s -> 5347.10s]  What? Every Starbucks comes together.
[5347.30s -> 5349.02s]  That's the big master plan.
[5350.36s -> 5353.52s]  They just like press the button that activates every Starbucks building.
[5353.64s -> 5354.88s]  And they all come together and like
[5354.92s -> 5359.36s]  Minecraft block, make a gigantic transformer and like take over the fucking galaxy.
[5366.39s -> 5370.19s]  It was all operated by like baristas doing like espresso machines.
[5371.66s -> 5373.02s]  It's like steam powered.
[5377.42s -> 5381.37s]  Anyways, I've never had it.
[5381.57s -> 5384.05s]  I know people love this shit, but I've never had it.
[5384.81s -> 5386.17s]  I've seen a bunch of these.
[5389.55s -> 5392.31s]  Well, here's a great way you can call me out on my bullshit, right?
[5392.75s -> 5396.82s]  You want to see like you want to like compare data, see how much of a liar I
[5397.02s -> 5401.74s]  possibly am, right? I did this like three years ago and I'm updating it.
[5402.89s -> 5406.77s]  Did I like fake Andy like pretend that this place was good because everybody
[5406.77s -> 5410.86s]  likes it and put it like up here like, oh, yes, take a shake.
[5410.90s -> 5411.66s]  It's good shit, man.
[5411.86s -> 5416.22s]  Like, did I like fake pretend like pander Andy, everybody?
[5418.45s -> 5420.65s]  Because you can like compare this list,
[5420.85s -> 5427.33s]  especially to like places that I don't really remember eating and be like he put
[5427.83s -> 5429.91s]  he put like steak and shake there.
[5436.30s -> 5446.25s]  You did that with Popeyes.
[5446.45s -> 5447.97s]  Yeah, this is illegal. It can't be there.
[5449.94s -> 5450.74s]  I have never eaten it.
[5450.74s -> 5454.30s]  I can't say I like the way the menu looks and put it in a tier.
[5454.50s -> 5455.42s]  That's not fair.
[5456.06s -> 5460.83s]  That's so unfair.
[5461.03s -> 5461.99s]  I hate this place.
[5462.19s -> 5462.99s]  I'm sorry.
[5485.38s -> 5490.10s]  I was standing in front of a subway one time and there were other restaurants
[5490.30s -> 5491.66s]  like around this place.
[5492.48s -> 5499.29s]  I was really hungry and I looked up the other restaurant on like Yelp
[5500.62s -> 5505.06s]  and this shit had like a three on Yelp, like a three, four.
[5505.82s -> 5511.44s]  I was like, oh, oh, I don't know about that.
[5515.30s -> 5529.79s]  And I didn't I didn't go to the subway call.
[5529.83s -> 5531.03s]  All right. I'm going to say this, too.
[5531.23s -> 5532.35s]  I probably said this before.
[5534.78s -> 5537.22s]  Oh, I'm going to be elitist, Andy.
[5537.42s -> 5538.42s]  No, I'm not.
[5539.24s -> 5545.00s]  If you don't have at least a high three or four or four point, at least not going
[5545.20s -> 5552.71s]  to your restaurant like you got to have at least like a high three.
[5553.54s -> 5554.70s]  I refuse to go.
[5554.90s -> 5556.06s]  I'm not going to go.
[5564.88s -> 5570.60s]  None of these count, by the way, because you want to do an experiment.
[5571.96s -> 5578.08s]  Go to go type in McDonald's into your like Google Maps or like
[5578.28s -> 5582.90s]  Apple Maps or whatever, right, and try to find a McDonald's or any
[5583.10s -> 5587.76s]  of these fast food kind of restaurants, right, that are over like a two five.
[5588.39s -> 5590.15s]  They're all like two point six.
[5590.15s -> 5590.63s]  Yeah.
[5591.01s -> 5595.13s]  All these fast food restaurants match my GPA that I had in fucking like high school
[5595.33s -> 5604.24s]  and college, but I'm talking about like a non chain restaurant.
[5605.70s -> 5607.22s]  If you're a non chain restaurant
[5607.26s -> 5611.78s]  and you don't have at least like a three, six, three, seven on like Google and Yelp,
[5613.95s -> 5616.07s]  I'm not eating it. I'm not going to eat there.
[5617.15s -> 5618.03s]  It's very powerful.
[5618.23s -> 5619.31s]  It's incredibly powerful.
[5627.82s -> 5629.62s]  Or five, four, three, four, eight.
[5629.82s -> 5631.34s]  What's wrong with your McDonald's?
[5633.82s -> 5636.82s]  Where you guys have high ranking McDonald's near you.
[5638.48s -> 5639.84s]  My local ones are three five.
[5640.04s -> 5646.61s]  What? Why is every McDonald's have been to like a two, a one, like a one point five?
[5648.90s -> 5650.46s]  It's because you live in a city.
[5654.68s -> 5656.24s]  My McDonald's has a three eight.
[5656.24s -> 5660.66s]  What is because you live in Las Vegas?
[5669.23s -> 5670.75s]  I think most of the McDonald's around here,
[5670.95s -> 5679.85s]  I think have like high twos or like mid twos or at least three or low threes.
[5680.54s -> 5685.60s]  Hold on. I got to fucking see.
[5691.93s -> 5693.41s]  Yours is three nine.
[5693.61s -> 5696.92s]  No way. I don't believe that everybody.
[5697.12s -> 5701.04s]  Look, the reason why I'm saying this is not because all these those restaurants are
[5701.24s -> 5707.27s]  like twos, it's because people find reasons to fucking hate fast food restaurants.
[5708.38s -> 5709.38s]  I don't know what it is,
[5709.58s -> 5713.62s]  but like you will read some of these reviews and you will I'll be OK.
[5714.18s -> 5716.74s]  I'll be like in the drive thru and you like over here.
[5716.74s -> 5718.06s]  The things that people are saying.
[5718.26s -> 5721.74s]  And it's just like, why is this person such a dick?
[5723.52s -> 5725.16s]  Like, what is it with people that I like?
[5725.16s -> 5726.08s]  I don't understand.
[5728.38s -> 5729.90s]  Like, let me tell you something.
[5730.10s -> 5735.24s]  There was a ketchup packet that wasn't put in my bag and the food's fucking awful.
[5735.24s -> 5736.40s]  It was awful, by the way.
[5736.60s -> 5738.44s]  It was it wasn't like the most high quality
[5738.44s -> 5742.56s]  five star restaurant food that I come to expect when I pay good money for something.
[5742.56s -> 5743.92s]  It's like, dude, you're at McDonald's.
[5743.96s -> 5746.58s]  Like, what are you talking about?
[5746.78s -> 5755.28s]  People put like fast food on this like fucking insane pedestal where it's like,
[5756.10s -> 5757.66s]  is that burger Angus beef?
[5758.68s -> 5761.24s]  That'd be like, well, it's fucking McDonald's, man.
[5761.24s -> 5762.80s]  Relax. It's like Burger King.
[5764.07s -> 5766.67s]  And a lot of those workers are like trying to fucking help you.
[5769.80s -> 5776.82s]  I feel for some of these fucking workers, seriously, because, man, you hear the stories
[5776.82s -> 5780.34s]  of people that just you just mean just shit people through the fucking drive
[5780.50s -> 5782.26s]  through people fucking with the restaurant and stuff.
[5783.59s -> 5784.83s]  Holy shit, man.
[5792.25s -> 5796.15s]  Give me your money.
[5796.63s -> 5798.51s]  Why did I read that person?
[5799.21s -> 5803.76s]  Anyways, I've never had taco bueno.
[5804.78s -> 5805.78s]  I've never had this.
[5806.54s -> 5807.54s]  I've never had this.
[5808.04s -> 5809.40s]  I've never had this.
[5810.35s -> 5811.47s]  I've never had this.
[5811.98s -> 5813.18s]  I don't live in Canada.
[5814.51s -> 5815.47s]  I've never had this.
[5816.87s -> 5818.31s]  I've never had Waffle House.
[5819.14s -> 5820.90s]  I've never had Wawa.
[5821.10s -> 5822.18s]  I've had Wendy's.
[5833.62s -> 5835.30s]  This is not done.
[5835.50s -> 5836.66s]  It's not done.
[5836.86s -> 5837.70s]  I'm not done.
[5837.90s -> 5839.22s]  I've not had Wawa.
[5846.96s -> 5851.49s]  This is unfair, though, because I'm biased towards Mexican food.
[5851.69s -> 5853.93s]  Would I rather have Wendy's or Del Taco?
[5855.39s -> 5863.38s]  I'm completely biased to Mexican food, so I would probably rather go to Del Taco
[5864.07s -> 5866.55s]  or Taco Bell or fast food.
[5866.75s -> 5873.93s]  You put Wendy's behind Del Taco because of fries.
[5875.65s -> 5879.73s]  I would rather go to a Mexican restaurant than a burger restaurant.
[5879.93s -> 5888.06s]  I just told you that Mexican food is my number one favorite food of all the genres.
[5889.03s -> 5892.76s]  It goes Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian,
[5896.85s -> 5899.17s]  or sometimes depending on the day, that flips.
[5903.77s -> 5905.49s]  I've not had Whataburger.
[5907.08s -> 5911.80s]  White Castle should be here, but I've never really had it.
[5912.00s -> 5913.72s]  I've seen it in the freezers.
[5917.42s -> 5918.98s]  Wait, I think maybe I've had it once.
[5920.51s -> 5924.23s]  Some of these places that I just don't remember eating, I've had maybe one time.
[5926.27s -> 5933.21s]  Fuck, which sandwiches?
[5935.06s -> 5936.62s]  Never had Wienerschnitzel.
[5937.89s -> 5939.41s]  I've never had Wingstop.
[5940.83s -> 5943.31s]  I don't know what this place is, and I don't know what this place is.
[5951.11s -> 5952.31s]  I've never had Wingstop, I've never had it.
[5952.51s -> 5961.50s]  It's time to clean this up a little bit and get this in a spot where I'm comfortable.
[5972.24s -> 5973.36s]  We've got to start at the bottom.
[5974.12s -> 5975.68s]  You have this. I've been here for two hours.
[5975.68s -> 5977.16s]  Holy shit, this is a lot of fun.
[5977.54s -> 5978.62s]  I like life. I love this.
[5978.82s -> 5983.14s]  This is great fun. I'm fucking blessed.
[5983.34s -> 5989.29s]  I love this. All right, subway.
[5989.49s -> 5991.49s]  We have so many more things to do today.
[5992.18s -> 5995.70s]  This is the longest one because this has the most amount of things on it.
[5996.21s -> 5998.45s]  This is probably arguably the most important to a lot of you.
[5998.65s -> 6000.77s]  This is the big one, so we're going to do the big one first.
[6001.59s -> 6002.23s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6002.86s -> 6004.42s]  All right, Subway and Sonic.
[6004.62s -> 6007.38s]  I would probably rather I would rather go
[6007.58s -> 6011.98s]  to Subway than Sonic just because I know I know the food will be fucking warm.
[6012.18s -> 6014.50s]  I just I really hate to say it, but I do mean that.
[6015.78s -> 6018.06s]  I'd rather go to Subway than Dunkin' Donuts,
[6019.14s -> 6022.14s]  but I don't know if I would put Dunkin' Donuts disgusting.
[6023.34s -> 6024.78s]  I know it's so itchy.
[6026.06s -> 6028.50s]  Would I rather go to Subway than Domino's?
[6042.89s -> 6043.93s]  I don't think so.
[6045.52s -> 6048.48s]  Would I rather go to Burger King or Domino's Burger King?
[6053.66s -> 6054.46s]  Yeah, I can say that.
[6054.62s -> 6058.06s]  Would rather go to Burger King or Dairy Queen?
[6061.70s -> 6063.30s]  I would rather go to Burger King.
[6063.80s -> 6072.79s]  But does that mean the Dairy Queen should be down at poor?
[6075.60s -> 6078.56s]  Would I rather go to Domino's than Dairy Queen?
[6079.77s -> 6081.97s]  Nope, because the ice cream that stays.
[6092.14s -> 6094.82s]  Would I rather go to Burger King than Cinnabon?
[6096.54s -> 6099.34s]  Yeah, Cinnabon is just like a one menu, Andy.
[6099.54s -> 6100.50s]  Yeah, I probably would.
[6100.70s -> 6102.22s]  Would rather go to Dairy Queen than Cinnabon?
[6102.42s -> 6114.46s]  Yes, I can say an average one menu item, Andy.
[6117.07s -> 6118.23s]  But it's good.
[6118.70s -> 6122.22s]  I just don't think if we're basing this on like where I would where I would rather
[6122.42s -> 6133.03s]  go or what I would deem to be better to go, I mean, I could just rate on the merits
[6133.23s -> 6137.35s]  of just quality of the food, but then this shouldn't be up here.
[6139.26s -> 6140.10s]  You know what I mean?
[6140.30s -> 6143.54s]  I'm basing this on like what I would prefer to do, where I would want to go,
[6143.54s -> 6144.94s]  where I would where I would go.
[6154.60s -> 6155.44s]  I'm going to keep it for now.
[6155.44s -> 6155.72s]  All right.
[6155.72s -> 6157.72s]  Would I rather go to Burger King than Starbucks?
[6161.10s -> 6163.10s]  Probably not. I would rather go to Starbucks.
[6166.17s -> 6171.85s]  Denny's or Starbucks, Starbucks, IHOP or Starbucks?
[6171.85s -> 6173.57s]  What's better? Probably Starbucks.
[6175.80s -> 6178.16s]  Hold on. We're moving a lot of people around here.
[6178.36s -> 6179.44s]  Burger King or Denny's?
[6179.44s -> 6180.40s]  I'd rather go to Burger King.
[6180.40s -> 6181.64s]  No, I'd rather go to Denny's.
[6182.21s -> 6183.61s]  No, depends on the day.
[6184.24s -> 6185.24s]  What time is it?
[6187.86s -> 6189.34s]  What time is it right now?
[6190.74s -> 6192.18s]  Is it over midnight?
[6192.38s -> 6194.36s]  Is it like 2 a.m.?
[6194.56s -> 6196.16s]  If it's 2 a.m., this is up here.
[6197.94s -> 6201.62s]  If it's like four o'clock in the afternoon, it's like down here.
[6205.52s -> 6206.16s]  This is hard.
[6210.95s -> 6213.15s]  I would probably rather go to Denny's than Burger King.
[6213.66s -> 6214.58s]  No, I wouldn't.
[6217.90s -> 6219.42s]  I would rather go to Denny's than IHOP.
[6219.42s -> 6226.33s]  That's for sure. So this has to go down here.
[6226.53s -> 6228.57s]  Do I think Arby's is better than Cold Stone?
[6228.77s -> 6230.69s]  No. Do I think Starbucks is better than Arby's?
[6230.69s -> 6231.13s]  Yes.
[6232.98s -> 6236.26s]  Again, it's just like a quality and like food and like what I'd rather have.
[6239.70s -> 6240.94s]  I'd rather go to Denny's than Arby's.
[6240.94s -> 6242.22s]  I'd rather go to Burger King than Arby's.
[6246.25s -> 6247.25s]  Would I rather go to...
[6247.45s -> 6249.29s]  Do I think Dairy Queen is better than Arby's?
[6249.66s -> 6252.93s]  Yes, because they have ice cream.
[6260.41s -> 6262.73s]  But Arby's too disgusting.
[6269.76s -> 6271.04s]  Arby's has ice cream?
[6271.24s -> 6274.52s]  Not Dairy Queen is known for their like blizzards and ice cream.
[6274.52s -> 6275.44s]  That's not the same.
[6278.70s -> 6279.98s]  Are you wearing lipstick today?
[6280.18s -> 6283.94s]  I'm using chapstick because my lips get very dry.
[6287.16s -> 6288.28s]  Thanks for reminding me to do it.
[6288.48s -> 6296.10s]  But Arby's has a funny Twitter.
[6297.82s -> 6303.46s]  If you honestly think I give a shit about like what is going on on like a comp,
[6303.66s -> 6308.54s]  like a fast food Twitter, I fucking care.
[6308.74s -> 6312.18s]  That's the last thing I can think of that I would like care about,
[6313.06s -> 6316.00s]  is what does Arby's have to say about this?
[6316.20s -> 6323.01s]  It's funny, I guess, right?
[6323.01s -> 6324.37s]  Like if they say something funny,
[6325.58s -> 6329.62s]  but I'm not like actively searching for what like Dairy Queen had to say
[6329.62s -> 6330.82s]  about something like a topic.
[6331.02s -> 6336.92s]  I don't... Have you seen Twitter?
[6338.28s -> 6343.65s]  Guys, I'm on social media maybe once or twice a month, maybe.
[6344.54s -> 6348.78s]  I like Twitter, Discord,
[6349.22s -> 6350.06s]  and it doesn't matter.
[6350.26s -> 6353.74s]  I like I don't use social media really that much at all.
[6355.14s -> 6358.34s]  So if I miss like the cool thing that like Burger King said, I'm going to miss it.
[6360.63s -> 6363.39s]  Make a tier below disgusting and put Arby's in it.
[6363.59s -> 6365.71s]  No, because I can't speak to that.
[6365.71s -> 6369.87s]  I've had it a few times and I don't remember it being like horrendous.
[6370.07s -> 6372.15s]  I remember it was just it was fine.
[6373.06s -> 6375.62s]  And that's sometimes all you want is fine.
[6375.82s -> 6378.14s]  You don't need to have every single restaurant.
[6378.34s -> 6381.86s]  Everything in average is not bad.
[6381.90s -> 6383.14s]  It's stuff that I would eat.
[6383.34s -> 6388.12s]  If you presented me with a Jimmy John's sandwich right now and said,
[6388.32s -> 6392.85s]  would you eat that? I'd go, yeah, I would.
[6394.06s -> 6397.58s]  If you presented me with a fresh Cinnabon, I'd go, yeah, sure.
[6397.78s -> 6398.54s]  I'll take it.
[6399.42s -> 6407.57s]  If you presented me with a gross grilled cheese from Friendly's,
[6420.42s -> 6422.78s]  I'd eat it, but I wouldn't be very happy about it.
[6426.32s -> 6427.44s]  But Friendly's shouldn't.
[6427.64s -> 6431.31s]  Friendly's is like a restaurant for kids.
[6431.51s -> 6439.28s]  OK, Friendly's is a place where the whole menu is the kids menu.
[6439.48s -> 6442.28s]  I'm doing it, I think a little bit of
[6442.72s -> 6452.10s]  disservice here by putting it here, but I think I'm going to keep it here.
[6452.30s -> 6455.58s]  It's a great place to take like kids.
[6455.78s -> 6457.90s]  I've been to a few, at least three or four
[6458.10s -> 6462.22s]  Friendly's before in my life, and people were really nice.
[6462.22s -> 6464.62s]  They were really, you know, if you go with like a couple of kids,
[6464.82s -> 6467.78s]  it's like they come and get milkshakes and like the staff was really friendly
[6467.78s -> 6469.26s]  and everyone was like, it was fine. It was good.
[6469.26s -> 6470.26s]  It was it was fine.
[6473.84s -> 6475.72s]  So I don't I'm not going to put it down here.
[6475.72s -> 6477.04s]  I don't think it deserves to be down there.
[6480.81s -> 6482.33s]  It's a place to get like an ice cream
[6482.33s -> 6484.77s]  and bring like the kids to have like a lunch or something.
[6484.77s -> 6486.85s]  And they get to go the kids get to go to a restaurant.
[6487.05s -> 6488.45s]  Excuse me, I'm putting this up.
[6489.40s -> 6492.44s]  They give you the little thing with the crayons.
[6492.44s -> 6495.68s]  They give you a piece of paper with like activities and quizzes on it and stuff.
[6496.57s -> 6498.21s]  Yeah, this is not fair at all.
[6498.41s -> 6499.17s]  It's unfair.
[6500.25s -> 6502.29s]  This is a nice this is a nice place.
[6502.49s -> 6504.13s]  It's a really just nice little place.
[6511.29s -> 6512.25s]  I'll fix it later.
[6516.91s -> 6519.11s]  Every time I've gone to like friendlies,
[6520.32s -> 6525.06s]  the response from the children was that was great.
[6525.26s -> 6527.10s]  That was it was a great time.
[6527.93s -> 6530.85s]  And if that's what they're trying to do, then they know they're not going to go
[6530.85s -> 6532.29s]  down here. No, they're not.
[6537.59s -> 6538.79s]  What children?
[6541.28s -> 6547.29s]  As I have nieces and nephews, I have like siblings.
[6547.49s -> 6549.01s]  A place to take the kids.
[6551.82s -> 6556.46s]  OK, I got to hurry up because we have like 30 things to do.
[6556.66s -> 6558.98s]  And I've already like on this for three hours.
[6561.55s -> 6566.79s]  Holdstone is good, but it's hard to rate the ice cream places
[6567.68s -> 6570.00s]  because they only do ice cream. It's hard to do this.
[6571.08s -> 6574.52s]  So I'm just going to say I'd probably would go to Starbucks.
[6574.72s -> 6576.76s]  I would rather I would probably go to Panera.
[6577.39s -> 6580.26s]  Yeah, I'd go to Panera friendlies.
[6580.26s -> 6582.18s]  Yeah, I mean, of course, take those kids.
[6582.94s -> 6584.58s]  Chipotle can stay here.
[6584.58s -> 6585.50s]  Most can stay here.
[6585.50s -> 6587.42s]  Einstein Brothers Bagels needs to come way up.
[6587.42s -> 6588.74s]  Little Caesar has to come way down.
[6591.68s -> 6593.84s]  Jason's Deli needs to go down as well.
[6595.05s -> 6598.91s]  I would actually have to put these here and I would rather go to Panera.
[6599.61s -> 6600.61s]  Like just straight up.
[6605.40s -> 6607.84s]  They are they are like equal in my brain.
[6607.84s -> 6610.16s]  But I would I have that cheddar broccoli soup from Panera.
[6610.36s -> 6611.84s]  You just you can't you can't beat it.
[6617.78s -> 6619.58s]  I'm imagining me going into Jason's Deli
[6619.58s -> 6621.50s]  and getting like what I would order at Jason's Deli.
[6621.70s -> 6625.02s]  And then the the cheddar broccoli soup in a bread bowl.
[6625.91s -> 6626.83s]  And I want that more.
[6632.84s -> 6635.49s]  What are you eating at Starbucks?
[6635.69s -> 6637.25s]  Like I said, that's why it's hard to do
[6637.45s -> 6640.33s]  some of these restaurants that only have one product.
[6644.80s -> 6646.12s]  All right. Little Caesar's.
[6646.32s -> 6648.92s]  These are kind of on these are all in the same tier for me, I think.
[6650.00s -> 6651.72s]  These are on the same tier, but I'd rather go here.
[6652.89s -> 6655.29s]  I'd rather go here than all these places combined.
[6656.30s -> 6657.58s]  I'd rather go to KFC.
[6658.34s -> 6660.78s]  I'd rather go to I'd rather go to KFC than Pizza Hut.
[6661.61s -> 6664.45s]  I'd rather go to Einstein Brothers Bagels and all these.
[6664.89s -> 6665.85s]  So Baro's good.
[6670.19s -> 6671.63s]  Where do I put Jack in the box?
[6672.26s -> 6676.30s]  I would probably rather go to KFC than Jack.
[6676.30s -> 6678.58s]  No, I wouldn't. Those little mini tacos.
[6679.28s -> 6680.36s]  Holy shit.
[6682.14s -> 6684.20s]  A little mini ones.
[6684.40s -> 6685.52s]  It's like taco popcorn.
[6695.37s -> 6698.05s]  But Rutgers is coming down a little bit because to me,
[6698.25s -> 6702.22s]  Rutgers is like it's like an attraction restaurant to me.
[6703.07s -> 6705.75s]  I've been to a couple of attractions
[6706.58s -> 6713.71s]  that had a Fudd Rutgers there and I've never seen it anywhere else.
[6717.42s -> 6719.46s]  And I think I've only had I think it was a good it was good.
[6719.50s -> 6722.38s]  It was I think I've only had it like once, though, twice, maybe.
[6732.35s -> 6733.75s]  I don't remember how much I liked it,
[6733.95s -> 6737.62s]  but I would probably I would rather go here if I'm honest.
[6741.33s -> 6742.65s]  All right. This is where it gets interesting.
[6742.85s -> 6744.49s]  But I'd rather go to Jack in the box.
[6747.55s -> 6751.90s]  I'd rather go to I'd rather go to Moe's than Blaze Pizza.
[6752.10s -> 6753.98s]  Blaze Pizza I think is lower than Moe's.
[6754.36s -> 6756.08s]  Jimmy John's has to come way down.
[6756.28s -> 6757.72s]  Krispy Kreme come way down.
[6758.54s -> 6759.94s]  Jersey Mike's way down.
[6766.66s -> 6770.70s]  These are only down here because they're just you go get a donut.
[6770.90s -> 6774.02s]  You go get a Cinnabon.
[6774.22s -> 6776.96s]  What do you want me to do?
[6777.16s -> 6780.32s]  They're good, but it's like there's only one thing you can do.
[6782.30s -> 6783.34s]  Firehouse does not stay.
[6783.34s -> 6797.17s]  Firehouse is going to move to a dessert category.
[6797.37s -> 6799.37s]  That's probably not a bad idea.
[6799.57s -> 6803.77s]  That's not a bad idea to just have dessert be a separate category.
[6803.77s -> 6805.69s]  But is there even enough to do a separate category?
[6805.89s -> 6808.17s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[6808.17s -> 6809.01s]  There is. OK.
[6813.12s -> 6814.92s]  Play Elden Ring. It's not out yet.
[6817.15s -> 6818.83s]  And I'm going to I'm going to piss my pants.
[6819.03s -> 6820.79s]  I've been drinking fucking coffee.
[6821.36s -> 6825.10s]  I'll be right back.
[6825.30s -> 7200.53s]  Airbnb. I have returned.
[7207.56s -> 7215.85s]  How are you? All right.
[7215.85s -> 7220.44s]  What were we doing? Oh, yeah.
[7220.44s -> 7223.84s]  I was showing you my awesome tier list that everyone is going to agree with.
[7235.29s -> 7238.49s]  Oh, would I rather I got to get the top done, right?
[7245.01s -> 7245.97s]  Do another tier list.
[7246.17s -> 7248.41s]  I had there are I have a lot of tier list.
[7248.61s -> 7252.17s]  We're going to have to go quick for some of these.
[7254.98s -> 7256.14s]  I think I like this.
[7256.14s -> 7257.18s]  I like how this is.
[7257.18s -> 7260.70s]  I would rather go to I would rather go to Jack in the Box than Ania's.
[7262.93s -> 7264.69s]  Oh, I probably would rather go.
[7264.89s -> 7266.41s]  I don't know if I would rather go to Jollibee.
[7268.70s -> 7270.70s]  It's good, but not to bar.
[7270.90s -> 7272.38s]  I think this is accurate.
[7276.28s -> 7278.08s]  You need to put a time limit on yourself.
[7278.46s -> 7279.46s]  I don't have to put a time.
[7279.66s -> 7282.97s]  Look, I I'm going to be live for a while.
[7283.17s -> 7286.78s]  I said a few hours, but I should have said several.
[7286.98s -> 7291.38s]  I should have said several hours because this is going to be a lot longer than I
[7291.58s -> 7303.52s]  think it is. I'm so burpy.
[7303.72s -> 7305.91s]  OK, all right, let's go.
[7305.91s -> 7306.55s]  Let's do it.
[7307.14s -> 7309.38s]  I'd rather go to Del Taco than Wendy's.
[7309.58s -> 7310.42s]  I just would.
[7310.62s -> 7312.82s]  I would rather go to In-N-Out than Del Taco.
[7312.82s -> 7315.34s]  I think that Boston Market probably can stay there.
[7316.04s -> 7321.32s]  That's just bias from the part of the country that I have like lived in most of
[7321.52s -> 7325.30s]  my life, so I don't know if it should be there.
[7325.50s -> 7327.34s]  I would five guys.
[7335.39s -> 7337.11s]  Haynes is so good.
[7343.44s -> 7347.84s]  This is a battle because I've had both of these pretty I've had them pretty recently.
[7382.71s -> 7385.51s]  Ben and Jerry's just Ben and Jerry shouldn't be up here.
[7385.67s -> 7389.59s]  I I like eating the pints of Ben and Jerry's from the grocery store.
[7389.79s -> 7390.79s]  This shouldn't be up here.
[7391.23s -> 7394.67s]  I'm going to keep it here, but I'm going to move it because like it honestly
[7394.67s -> 7395.43s]  shouldn't be here.
[7395.87s -> 7397.59s]  This is really what it probably looks like.
[7397.79s -> 7402.54s]  We're just this is because like nostalgia purposes, this is here ego.
[7403.50s -> 7406.70s]  I have completed my updated tier list.
[7422.62s -> 7423.86s]  There's no being too high.
[7431.02s -> 7433.50s]  The reason OK, the reason why Keynes is
[7433.70s -> 7442.32s]  number one is I just imagined myself taking that hot dog roll Texas toast thing
[7442.72s -> 7445.36s]  and dunking it in the sauce and biting it.
[7446.25s -> 7451.13s]  And it was a far better experience than everything else on this whole list.
[7453.42s -> 7454.30s]  On the whole list.
[7456.41s -> 7459.73s]  So that's why I think it deserves to be there on my updated list.
[7465.10s -> 7466.82s]  Haynes sauce sucks.
[7468.98s -> 7470.30s]  What do we do? What do we do with them?
[7471.96s -> 7473.60s]  You decide what do we do with them?
[7473.80s -> 7474.80s]  What do we do with them?
[7475.88s -> 7478.84s]  What do we do with them?
[7479.04s -> 7480.64s]  That's like cross-eyed.
[7480.84s -> 7482.84s]  What what what do we do with that guy?
[7482.96s -> 7484.04s]  What do we do with them?
[7485.89s -> 7487.13s]  What do we do with that guy?
[7493.71s -> 7495.27s]  You guys didn't know I could move one eye.
[7511.48s -> 7512.92s]  Don't do that. It like it sucks.
[7515.92s -> 7518.54s]  Stop. I can.
[7518.74s -> 7520.10s]  Oh, shit, I forgot.
[7520.30s -> 7523.02s]  I forgot there's a screen cap feature.
[7523.22s -> 7525.14s]  New meme.
[7531.34s -> 7532.82s]  Yeah, what did it look like?
[7533.02s -> 7543.39s]  I already regret it. Yeah, I regret it already.
[7543.59s -> 7550.83s]  Can I see it?
[7551.03s -> 7553.55s]  When the Keynes sauce hits.
[7560.90s -> 7561.86s]  Hold on.
[7562.06s -> 7564.15s]  I'm going to get out of here.
[7564.35s -> 7573.73s]  I'm leaving.
[7573.93s -> 7580.42s]  Oh,
[7581.22s -> 7583.94s]  when the Keynes sauce hits.
[7584.18s -> 7587.42s]  No,
[7587.62s -> 7606.65s]  fuck, I got to zoom in.
[7606.85s -> 7607.89s]  Hold on. No, I can't.
[7608.09s -> 7611.75s]  I'll mess up the whole thing.
[7611.95s -> 7615.56s]  OK, I'm moving on to the next list.
[7617.92s -> 7620.76s]  Here's here's my final thoughts on that one.
[7620.96s -> 7621.64s]  There it is.
[7626.24s -> 7627.88s]  That's the new worst face.
[7630.11s -> 7633.67s]  I don't think it's consequences for any of my actions, unfortunately.
[7633.87s -> 7634.55s]  Here you go.
[7634.75s -> 7644.92s]  It has been completed.
[7645.12s -> 7645.84s]  There it is.
[7646.04s -> 7648.16s]  There is my official updated list.
[7648.54s -> 7649.94s]  We're going to move on to the next one.
[7651.59s -> 7652.27s]  Take a look. There you go.
[7652.47s -> 7653.19s]  You want your screenshot?
[7653.19s -> 7655.88s]  There it is.
[7656.08s -> 7659.70s]  I don't know anything about that.
[7660.66s -> 7662.46s]  Oh, wait, I was facing the wrong way.
[7662.66s -> 7664.58s]  Who cares?
[7664.78s -> 7669.02s]  This next one is an update called best fruits.
[7669.02s -> 7669.78s]  I've done this already.
[7669.78s -> 7671.02s]  Let's see if I can see.
[7671.22s -> 7672.46s]  This is going to take a long time.
[7676.42s -> 7677.06s]  This is going to take a while.
[7677.26s -> 7679.10s]  I've been eating a lot more fruits.
[7679.79s -> 7681.95s]  I've been eating a lot more vegetables and fruits lately.
[7683.54s -> 7684.46s]  I'm going to see.
[7684.66s -> 7686.46s]  We'll compare it to the last one.
[7687.54s -> 7689.22s]  I'm going to do this very quick.
[7689.42s -> 7692.98s]  OK, lemon S.
[7693.18s -> 7694.50s]  Banana S.
[7695.75s -> 7697.70s]  Hair B.
[7698.52s -> 7700.00s]  Green apple A.
[7700.20s -> 7701.64s]  Red apple D.
[7701.84s -> 7702.84s]  Fuck red apples.
[7703.41s -> 7704.37s]  Apricots.
[7705.38s -> 7706.22s]  I don't really eat it.
[7706.42s -> 7711.04s]  I've never had one. Avocado B.
[7711.24s -> 7714.35s]  Blackberry flavor S.
[7715.37s -> 7717.62s]  Practice C.
[7717.82s -> 7720.26s]  I don't I don't like the fucking popcorn shells you get in your mouth.
[7720.46s -> 7722.71s]  All the all the berries, raspberries,
[7722.91s -> 7725.34s]  blackberries,
[7725.54s -> 7728.58s]  any of the berries that have the seeds because you'll bite them,
[7728.78s -> 7731.59s]  you'll eat them and you get the fucking popcorn shells.
[7733.34s -> 7735.38s]  And it's like, oh,
[7735.58s -> 7737.78s]  oh, I feel like a little like hard ball.
[7738.22s -> 7741.48s]  I don't like it. They taste phenomenal, though, but we're just going on.
[7741.68s -> 7743.24s]  I have to be fair to myself.
[7743.44s -> 7746.50s]  Kiwis S. No, they're A.
[7746.70s -> 7750.02s]  I've only ever had blackcurrant juice and blackcurrant jam.
[7750.66s -> 7752.14s]  I've never actually eaten the real fruit.
[7752.14s -> 7753.22s]  So I'm going to put it down here.
[7753.42s -> 7757.19s]  Blueberry. That's going to be that's going to be low A.
[7757.19s -> 7760.03s]  And I'm putting blueberry in low A and not S where it belongs,
[7760.41s -> 7762.49s]  because blueberries are very interesting.
[7763.12s -> 7766.28s]  They either are awful, like mushy and gross.
[7766.48s -> 7770.88s]  Or if you get a good pack, if you get good ones, they're unbelievable.
[7770.88s -> 7772.00s]  They're better than anything in the world.
[7773.40s -> 7774.80s]  I have to take that into consideration.
[7776.78s -> 7779.78s]  Cantaloupe D. Worst.
[7780.42s -> 7783.42s]  Absolute worst. I hate melon.
[7783.42s -> 7784.90s]  I hate I hate it. I think it's awful.
[7785.98s -> 7787.14s]  Cantaloupe is this stuff again.
[7787.14s -> 7787.82s]  I'll say it again.
[7787.82s -> 7789.18s]  And I probably said this a few years ago.
[7789.55s -> 7794.23s]  Cantaloupe is the stuff that you pick around in a fruit salad and you just leave.
[7794.43s -> 7797.79s]  And then if you still are really, really hungry and you still.
[7797.99s -> 7799.39s]  Whoa.
[7800.31s -> 7801.95s]  If you still really, really hungry,
[7802.29s -> 7805.57s]  you'll eat those last if you really are still feeling it.
[7807.48s -> 7809.36s]  Cherries, the actual fruit is probably
[7809.36s -> 7812.12s]  like a C, but cherry juice and cherry stuff is higher.
[7812.32s -> 7816.16s]  But I'm just basing this not on flavor.
[7816.66s -> 7819.42s]  I'm basing this on if I were to eat this thing.
[7820.38s -> 7822.18s]  So that means this should not be up here.
[7822.38s -> 7823.82s]  But I do that shit. I'm a weirdo.
[7826.37s -> 7827.69s]  I'm a weird motherfucker.
[7827.89s -> 7830.26s]  I like and go,
[7833.39s -> 7836.43s]  dragon fruit is I think dragon fruit takes over lemon.
[7840.07s -> 7841.11s]  But is it flavor?
[7841.31s -> 7843.63s]  I think we have to take everything into consideration.
[7847.40s -> 7852.10s]  Dragon fruit is what I want blackberries and raspberries to be
[7852.92s -> 7856.56s]  because the little seeds in dragon fruit are wonderful.
[7857.00s -> 7861.64s]  You bite into a dragon fruit and it's like this little nice crispy crunch.
[7861.84s -> 7862.84s]  Go through the seed.
[7863.73s -> 7865.01s]  It's so wonderful.
[7865.09s -> 7867.29s]  You can't do that with blackberries and raspberries.
[7869.01s -> 7870.25s]  Biting into a blackberry.
[7870.45s -> 7874.29s]  It's like the dragon fruit.
[7874.49s -> 7876.93s]  It's like pillowy little crispy seeds.
[7879.35s -> 7880.51s]  I love dragon fruit.
[7883.90s -> 7887.22s]  Coconut, the coconut flavor is F,
[7887.88s -> 7892.94s]  but the coconut water, coconut milk and coconut flavor is somewhere around here.
[7894.66s -> 7896.06s]  So that's what we'll average it out.
[7896.82s -> 7898.46s]  Cranberries. See you later.
[7900.11s -> 7901.55s]  Flavor, S.
[7902.18s -> 7903.62s]  Texture, S.
[7906.05s -> 7907.73s]  Health factor, S.
[7910.47s -> 7912.07s]  Tanginess, S.
[7913.73s -> 7915.47s]  Sweetness, F.
[7924.62s -> 7928.34s]  I've never had it, but I know it smells.
[7928.54s -> 7931.34s]  Figs are depends on how they're prepared.
[7931.34s -> 7933.98s]  I'm going to put them in C. Gooseberries.
[7933.98s -> 7935.42s]  They got a funny name, but I've never had them.
[7935.79s -> 7941.91s]  Grapefruit is F. Grapefruit just tastes like stomach acid.
[7942.11s -> 7943.03s]  I think I've said this before.
[7943.07s -> 7946.19s]  I've I've had burps that taste better than grapefruit.
[7949.77s -> 7955.18s]  I get to use that joke again, don't I?
[7955.38s -> 7956.30s]  OK, grapes.
[7957.38s -> 7958.82s]  Grapes are like blueberries.
[7959.45s -> 7964.70s]  If you get really good, like firm, juicy, cold grapes, they're amazing.
[7964.90s -> 7972.50s]  But if you get the fucking wilty kind of like sludge and they can go really low.
[7974.66s -> 7981.89s]  So they have I love them, though, if they're good, especially frozen grapes.
[7982.09s -> 7987.00s]  We might have to update this. Lime, S.
[7987.16s -> 7990.84s]  The only time I've ever had lychee is when it was in like a weird booze drink.
[7991.60s -> 7993.60s]  Oh, not really mango.
[7993.80s -> 7995.48s]  Hmm. What could it be is all right.
[7995.68s -> 7996.88s]  Nectarine. Excuse me.
[7997.51s -> 8000.10s]  This goes up here. Orange.
[8000.30s -> 8005.72s]  The fruit sucks worse than probably everything, but the flavor is unbelievable.
[8008.46s -> 8011.74s]  I hate eating oranges because of the weird,
[8011.94s -> 8018.22s]  gross sinew that's in an orange, that like white sinew.
[8018.42s -> 8022.30s]  Like, it's like a fucking like, you know,
[8022.46s -> 8023.14s]  disgusting.
[8025.62s -> 8029.42s]  I'm going to put it down at sea because I love orange juice and I love orange flavor,
[8030.89s -> 8033.73s]  but I cannot eat oranges. That's that's like weird.
[8033.73s -> 8034.53s]  It's got that. OK.
[8034.73s -> 8039.17s]  You know, like a raw chicken, like the raw chicken, like like fat that's on it
[8039.17s -> 8040.77s]  that you like kind of have to take off.
[8040.97s -> 8045.41s]  That's what it's like on an orange pie.
[8045.61s -> 8048.28s]  I don't really I don't really eat pie.
[8049.10s -> 8050.30s]  I don't really eat passion fruit.
[8050.50s -> 8053.42s]  It's just on every single box that has like tea in the name.
[8054.25s -> 8056.29s]  Oh, it's got passion fruit tea, passion fruit.
[8056.29s -> 8057.25s]  Like, I don't know.
[8057.82s -> 8060.02s]  Peaches are underneath nectarine, but they're still really good.
[8060.10s -> 8063.56s]  Although I'd probably put them down here at the permission.
[8063.56s -> 8064.44s]  I don't know what that is.
[8065.20s -> 8066.72s]  Pineapple is up here as well.
[8066.92s -> 8068.60s]  I love fruits, as you can tell.
[8069.42s -> 8072.70s]  Plums, I like the way they taste, but they're hard to kind of like weird
[8075.64s -> 8081.23s]  pomegranate or also like weird alien fruits, but they taste really good.
[8081.23s -> 8082.07s]  They're just hard to eat.
[8082.07s -> 8083.79s]  And I don't know, it's difficult to eat.
[8088.01s -> 8088.89s]  I don't know what this is.
[8089.78s -> 8090.90s]  Redcurrant, I don't know what that is.
[8090.90s -> 8093.55s]  I'm going to put it next to this one starfruit.
[8093.75s -> 8096.87s]  I mean, like if I was 12, I would probably put this higher
[8096.87s -> 8098.31s]  because it's like a Super Mario star.
[8098.31s -> 8099.87s]  But like, I don't really I've never had it.
[8099.91s -> 8100.39s]  I don't care.
[8100.96s -> 8102.28s]  Strawberry is up here somewhere.
[8102.48s -> 8105.68s]  Probably, I would say probably above, it's probably A.
[8106.50s -> 8108.10s]  Tangerine gets to stay with orange
[8108.10s -> 8110.18s]  because they have the gross sinew bullshit.
[8110.38s -> 8111.86s]  Watermelon is A at least.
[8112.88s -> 8116.12s]  I'm going to do melon F with cantaloupe.
[8116.12s -> 8117.52s]  Not as bad as grapefruit, though.
[8118.09s -> 8119.77s]  I've never really had an Asian pear.
[8120.14s -> 8121.58s]  I've never really had guava.
[8122.22s -> 8122.98s]  A lot of orange.
[8123.10s -> 8125.62s]  It's kind of just like a grosser version of a grapefruit.
[8125.82s -> 8126.74s]  It's like just weird.
[8126.94s -> 8128.26s]  Like, I don't know.
[8128.46s -> 8129.62s]  It's like it's too deep.
[8129.82s -> 8133.00s]  It's too like it's too heavy.
[8134.23s -> 8137.51s]  Grapefruit, at least to me, has like that acidic taste.
[8137.51s -> 8140.87s]  Blood orange has like the acidic taste and like the deep flavor.
[8140.87s -> 8141.47s]  I don't like it.
[8143.06s -> 8144.46s]  It's like an orange.
[8144.66s -> 8151.72s]  It's like the sinew of the of the orange and the grossness of the grapefruit to me.
[8158.18s -> 8162.62s]  I mean, I like the flavor is there for me, but it's just like the combination
[8162.82s -> 8166.02s]  of how I don't like I don't like citrus fruits eating them like this,
[8166.22s -> 8168.26s]  unless I'm like going to bite into a lemon and be a weirdo.
[8169.08s -> 8174.38s]  The citrus fruits have all that gross shit in it, especially oranges and things
[8174.42s -> 8178.72s]  in the orange family. Stop saying sinew.
[8178.92s -> 8182.85s]  Like it's a cool new word that I found out.
[8183.05s -> 8184.41s]  What is a custard apple?
[8185.87s -> 8187.51s]  I don't know. I never had a kumquat.
[8187.71s -> 8190.27s]  Never had a mulberry raisins.
[8190.47s -> 8193.19s]  If I'm in the mood for it are very high, but you have to be in the mood for it.
[8194.98s -> 8197.22s]  Jackfruit.
[8197.42s -> 8201.27s]  Have I ever had jackfruit? Maybe like once.
[8201.47s -> 8202.79s]  Sour cherry.
[8202.99s -> 8205.11s]  I don't I've not had really any of these.
[8205.94s -> 8206.94s]  All right, let's get this right.
[8213.78s -> 8216.54s]  Bananas are I don't know if I would.
[8216.74s -> 8218.06s]  Dragon fruit is like here.
[8218.69s -> 8219.85s]  Pineapple is higher than this.
[8219.85s -> 8220.73s]  Pineapple is probably here.
[8222.92s -> 8225.40s]  I would I would rather just eat a bowl of pineapples.
[8225.40s -> 8227.68s]  I know it's got the bromelain in it, right?
[8227.88s -> 8230.56s]  It's kind of hurts your mouth after a while, but it's really good.
[8233.24s -> 8234.28s]  I'd rather have a nectarine.
[8235.04s -> 8236.24s]  I'd rather have a nectarine.
[8236.94s -> 8238.78s]  That's good.
[8238.98s -> 8240.58s]  You know, when you get a good nectarine,
[8240.78s -> 8245.70s]  when you need a napkin in your other hand to take one bite because it's going to
[8245.70s -> 8247.46s]  you're going to get sprayed with like a super soaker.
[8247.90s -> 8248.90s]  That's how you know it's a good one.
[8253.63s -> 8256.11s]  It's just one of it's just the it's arguably the best fruit.
[8256.74s -> 8262.98s]  But I like bananas flavor a little better.
[8263.14s -> 8265.10s]  Strawberry is no, it's not.
[8266.38s -> 8266.94s]  No, it's not.
[8266.94s -> 8269.82s]  And you know why strawberry doesn't get to level up and strawberry might actually
[8270.02s -> 8273.19s]  come down. How many times have you gotten strawberries?
[8273.39s -> 8275.43s]  And it's just texture.
[8275.43s -> 8277.39s]  There's just nothing there that you can't taste anything.
[8278.79s -> 8281.15s]  Oh, a strawberry bite.
[8281.35s -> 8282.31s]  I don't you don't taste anything.
[8283.78s -> 8287.06s]  It's just like you kind of can like smell strawberry, but you don't taste strawberry.
[8291.53s -> 8294.53s]  I'm going to put them down here because they live in the same world.
[8294.90s -> 8300.65s]  They need to be really, really picked at the right time and in the right place
[8301.11s -> 8304.31s]  for them to taste the way and be texturally the way that I want them to be.
[8305.84s -> 8306.88s]  So it has to come down here.
[8313.72s -> 8314.84s]  Green apple is so good.
[8316.56s -> 8317.44s]  You know, it's funny about green apple.
[8317.44s -> 8320.36s]  The only reason why I like green apple is because of Jolly Ranchers.
[8321.89s -> 8322.41s]  That's it.
[8323.55s -> 8326.19s]  When I was younger, I loved green apple,
[8326.39s -> 8329.43s]  Jolly Ranchers to a point that it made me want to eat the fruit.
[8331.54s -> 8333.58s]  And ever since, it's been my favorite apple.
[8336.00s -> 8337.32s]  Delicious is S tier.
[8337.32s -> 8337.84s]  Is that what you said?
[8337.84s -> 8340.28s]  Because that's probably one of the most incorrect things I've ever heard.
[8351.09s -> 8353.45s]  There's no nutritional value in Las Vegas.
[8355.55s -> 8358.31s]  This is strawberries have the same problem everywhere.
[8358.47s -> 8361.27s]  Back when I was in Massachusetts, I had the same problem, too.
[8362.80s -> 8364.24s]  It's not like, oh, everything in Vegas is
[8364.44s -> 8370.09s]  devoid of all flavor and all know what some of the best restaurants
[8370.09s -> 8372.37s]  in the world that I've ever been to have been here.
[8373.26s -> 8376.10s]  Excuse me, I'm going to have a reason to stay.
[8380.63s -> 8384.24s]  OK, kiwis are amazing.
[8384.44s -> 8385.84s]  You know what I've come to realize?
[8387.75s -> 8390.79s]  I love crunchy seeds that you can eat.
[8391.49s -> 8393.57s]  I love that texture of biting into a kiwi
[8393.57s -> 8396.17s]  and you get to the seed part and it's like that little crunch.
[8396.86s -> 8400.78s]  I love it.
[8403.65s -> 8405.41s]  I don't know, avocado shouldn't be on here.
[8405.41s -> 8408.89s]  I know it's a fruit, but it's not used the way that fruits are used.
[8408.89s -> 8410.05s]  I'm taking it off the list.
[8411.00s -> 8413.77s]  Avocado is a vegetable and I know it's not.
[8414.53s -> 8416.49s]  I know, but I don't care.
[8418.53s -> 8421.65s]  Avocado is like a tier in a vegetable list.
[8424.01s -> 8426.69s]  I don't put pineapple on my like cheeseburgers.
[8427.96s -> 8432.90s]  I don't put like I don't put like a slice of nectarine on like a sandwich.
[8433.66s -> 8442.40s]  I I'm I'm just saying that sounds good.
[8442.40s -> 8443.76s]  It's literally not a vegetable, though.
[8443.76s -> 8445.16s]  And where's tomato then?
[8445.73s -> 8447.41s]  Show me the tomato. Where's the tomato?
[8449.83s -> 8450.59s]  Where's the tomato?
[8453.81s -> 8455.97s]  You want to fight semantics on me here?
[8456.86s -> 8457.74s]  Find me the tomato.
[8465.86s -> 8466.94s]  Fine, it'll fine.
[8467.14s -> 8467.94s]  It stays up here.
[8474.14s -> 8479.24s]  I would probably rather eat an apple than an orange, a red apple.
[8482.69s -> 8485.53s]  Little Macintosh apples are amazing, but nobody fucking has them.
[8485.53s -> 8487.13s]  Nobody sells them. I don't know why.
[8489.68s -> 8491.96s]  Why? How come I've not why have I not been
[8492.16s -> 8496.28s]  able to find a Macintosh little apple in like the last five years?
[8496.66s -> 8497.94s]  Why? They're better.
[8497.94s -> 8498.62s]  They're the best.
[8502.45s -> 8504.41s]  Now, even when I was in Massachusetts, I couldn't find them.
[8512.40s -> 8513.84s]  I love Macintosh apples.
[8513.84s -> 8515.52s]  They're the only red apple I like.
[8516.69s -> 8518.13s]  OK, I think this is good.
[8519.53s -> 8522.42s]  I'm happy with this lemon lime.
[8522.62s -> 8524.26s]  It's just it goes on everything.
[8524.26s -> 8525.22s]  It goes well in everything.
[8525.42s -> 8530.46s]  Lemon water, lemon candies, lemon, like a slice of lemon on something
[8530.66s -> 8532.34s]  like a squeeze of lime on stuff.
[8533.68s -> 8535.92s]  I mean, it's like you can't beat it.
[8537.64s -> 8538.52s]  I think this is good.
[8538.72s -> 8540.68s]  I'd rather have a nectarine than eating a banana.
[8543.94s -> 8544.50s]  There it is.
[8548.84s -> 8551.76s]  You just proved your avocado point wrong with lemon and lime.
[8559.43s -> 8569.93s]  What do you mean? Macintosh suck so bad.
[8570.13s -> 8571.45s]  I'm still not over that.
[8571.65s -> 8577.39s]  It's fucking I love it.
[8578.09s -> 8580.09s]  Would you just eat a lemon or a lime?
[8580.29s -> 8582.90s]  Yes.
[8583.10s -> 8584.82s]  Every time that there's a lemon or a lime
[8584.94s -> 8588.54s]  from a restaurant that they put on the side or something, I always just go
[8590.71s -> 8596.66s]  every time I love it, prove it.
[8598.31s -> 8599.55s]  Do you really want me to prove this by
[8599.75s -> 8602.43s]  like biting into and like enjoying a lime on stream?
[8602.63s -> 8603.59s]  That's not hard to do.
[8603.59s -> 8604.31s]  That's very easy.
[8604.51s -> 8605.87s]  That's a very easy thing to do.
[8608.55s -> 8612.03s]  It's not like eating a raw onion.
[8612.23s -> 8615.81s]  Limes are not as harsh as a lemon is.
[8616.01s -> 8618.97s]  It's not like biting into like an onion.
[8627.47s -> 8628.27s]  OK, here you go.
[8628.27s -> 8629.31s]  Let's move on to the next one.
[8629.39s -> 8630.55s]  We did that one. We did that one quick.
[8630.75s -> 8632.48s]  That's good. All right.
[8632.68s -> 8636.00s]  This is a American Mammals tier list.
[8637.46s -> 8638.50s]  Why am I even doing this one?
[8638.70s -> 8639.78s]  Who cares?
[8639.98s -> 8641.14s]  Who gives a shit?
[8643.18s -> 8647.10s]  Who actually gives a shit about this one?
[8647.30s -> 8648.94s]  You know what I mean? Like, who cares?
[8652.65s -> 8654.33s]  All right. How about we need some music?
[8654.33s -> 8655.57s]  We could use some music.
[8661.51s -> 8662.83s]  What's an OST you want to hear?
[8669.48s -> 8671.20s]  Mario Party OST.
[8674.26s -> 8676.02s]  But Deltarune. Oh, yeah, it's not bad.
[8676.22s -> 8677.30s]  It's not a bad one.
[8679.22s -> 8684.20s]  It's not a bad one.
[8689.31s -> 8689.79s]  All right.
[8690.77s -> 8692.81s]  It's got a nice and low just in the background.
[8692.81s -> 8694.13s]  We don't need to be loud.
[8695.08s -> 8696.32s]  It's a good shell in the background.
[8696.32s -> 8697.28s]  You know what I'm saying?
[8697.48s -> 8701.64s]  You know what I mean, Bird?
[8701.84s -> 8702.96s]  Let's continue.
[8703.59s -> 8705.39s]  Armadillo is Est here.
[8705.59s -> 8707.55s]  It's just what a cool animal.
[8708.82s -> 8711.85s]  Uh, Badger.
[8714.08s -> 8716.40s]  OK, wait, what's the criteria here, though?
[8716.84s -> 8722.42s]  Is it animals that I think are like cool, that I think are cool?
[8722.62s -> 8724.38s]  Or what's like the strongest one?
[8724.58s -> 8728.98s]  Just coolness factor. OK, I can do coolness factor.
[8729.68s -> 8730.84s]  About all right.
[8731.34s -> 8732.70s]  That's a pretty cool.
[8733.40s -> 8735.52s]  They're very cool, actually.
[8737.46s -> 8739.98s]  My dad is the only person other than you that says,
[8741.19s -> 8743.37s]  you know what I mean, Vern?
[8743.57s -> 8745.97s]  Well, your father is a hyper intelligent
[8746.17s -> 8749.37s]  individual who consumed countless hours of earnest.
[8749.57s -> 8755.94s]  So that's your dad is a very smart person.
[8756.14s -> 8757.26s]  Beaver.
[8757.46s -> 8759.58s]  Beaver, I would say probably be a beater.
[8760.34s -> 8762.26s]  Sheep, bighorn sheep, see?
[8762.64s -> 8764.56s]  Bisons, they're like big and cool.
[8764.72s -> 8767.28s]  Black Bear's ass, they're the cutest things in the world.
[8768.55s -> 8771.23s]  They're just so I just run through of Otto.
[8773.53s -> 8775.33s]  Bobcat.
[8775.53s -> 8776.37s]  Hi, B.
[8777.00s -> 8781.06s]  Caribou, C. Chipmunk is A just because it's
[8781.26s -> 8784.06s]  fun to watch them kind of scurry around and stuff.
[8784.26s -> 8790.26s]  Yeah. Iotis, B. Deer, B.
[8790.46s -> 8794.57s]  Well, baby deer is like holy shit.
[8794.77s -> 8798.49s]  What an adorable like the world is at peace right now.
[8798.49s -> 8799.77s]  When you look at like a baby deer.
[8800.23s -> 8811.23s]  But dolphins, dolphins are kind of cool.
[8811.67s -> 8813.95s]  I have all the horned
[8814.15s -> 8816.23s]  mammals that then come down to about C for me.
[8819.23s -> 8822.39s]  Fox, I feel like is S tier for too many people, which I'm a contrarian.
[8822.39s -> 8826.22s]  So I'm going to put it down at C because I can't like the thing that everybody else
[8826.42s -> 8829.54s]  likes because I how could I I can't I have to be the contrarian.
[8830.43s -> 8831.83s]  I like armadillos. I'm different.
[8831.83s -> 8834.47s]  I'm not like I'm not like everybody else.
[8834.67s -> 8835.55s]  Gophers are funny.
[8837.08s -> 8842.66s]  Grizzly bears are just huge grizzly bears are the bear of the bear world, I think.
[8844.13s -> 8845.45s]  So they get to be a pretty high.
[8846.94s -> 8849.90s]  Groundhogs and gophers are just like the same animal in my head.
[8850.10s -> 8853.30s]  So I don't even know what that is.
[8855.73s -> 8858.97s]  A javelina was a javelina.
[8862.93s -> 8865.30s]  Manatee is pretty high.
[8865.50s -> 8867.02s]  We might upgrade the manatee.
[8869.12s -> 8871.40s]  A marmot.
[8871.60s -> 8876.21s]  It's kind of like a beaver. Martin is kind of like a it's like a ferret.
[8877.03s -> 8878.47s]  Moles are S tier.
[8878.47s -> 8879.23s]  They're so weird.
[8879.43s -> 8880.63s]  What a strange animal.
[8883.18s -> 8885.10s]  Moose get to upgrade from the horned
[8885.30s -> 8888.30s]  animals list up to summer and B because they're just so huge.
[8888.50s -> 8889.46s]  They're massive.
[8889.50s -> 8890.34s]  It's interesting.
[8892.96s -> 8893.84s]  What is that?
[8894.04s -> 8894.96s]  What the fuck is that?
[8895.16s -> 8896.56s]  I thought that was a dog.
[8899.69s -> 8903.45s]  That looks like somebody drew like a Chad Brian the dog.
[8904.46s -> 8909.74s]  It's a mountain goat.
[8909.94s -> 8912.34s]  Why does it look so photoshopped?
[8916.36s -> 8917.24s]  Mountain lion.
[8917.24s -> 8918.60s]  You guys can hang out in the same place.
[8918.98s -> 8919.70s]  Mouse.
[8920.58s -> 8922.40s]  A tier. I love mice.
[8922.60s -> 8923.76s]  I love mice and I love rats.
[8925.61s -> 8926.93s]  Oh, a musk of the musk rat.
[8930.12s -> 8931.68s]  Kind of cool. Possums are weird.
[8931.88s -> 8934.16s]  Like so it's too weird to not be S.
[8938.82s -> 8939.70s]  I love otters.
[8939.90s -> 8940.86s]  I love when they go like this.
[8945.21s -> 8945.77s]  I love. Yeah.
[8945.85s -> 8953.89s]  They just because of this is the reason why they're up here.
[8956.82s -> 8959.02s]  I mean, like the sea mammals are really cool.
[8959.22s -> 8964.47s]  Whales go up really high just because this thing is just how does it even exist?
[8964.47s -> 8965.27s]  This is a dinosaur.
[8969.68s -> 8970.64s]  We have so many weird.
[8970.64s -> 8973.16s]  And OK, when people talk about I wonder what they imagine,
[8973.36s -> 8975.68s]  like how crazy shit would look on other planets.
[8976.38s -> 8979.26s]  Wow, like how fucked up and crazy would the animals be?
[8979.26s -> 8981.58s]  They'd have like antennas coming out of their heads.
[8981.78s -> 8985.81s]  They'd be this is look at a whale, look at like a big blue whale.
[8985.97s -> 8988.05s]  And you try to tell me that that wouldn't
[8988.25s -> 8991.53s]  be insane to see that if you were from another planet.
[8992.48s -> 8997.26s]  They're a big floating mass of just like soft tissue.
[8997.46s -> 9002.26s]  And they have these huge, huge like Muppet Mouse that go like
[9003.98s -> 9006.46s]  it's they're completely strange.
[9006.66s -> 9007.66s]  They're abnormal.
[9007.86s -> 9008.94s]  They're not from Earth.
[9011.62s -> 9013.42s]  They're like living machines in a way.
[9013.62s -> 9016.82s]  They're just giant hulking like monolith machines.
[9017.02s -> 9018.10s]  It's crazy.
[9018.30s -> 9019.46s]  They belong in us.
[9023.95s -> 9027.85s]  Why you cut my mic? Why?
[9028.05s -> 9029.77s]  That's kind of cool. Whatever that is.
[9030.27s -> 9031.83s]  Orcupine is kind of cool.
[9032.27s -> 9036.48s]  Furry dogs are kind of like, hmm, they're all right.
[9038.52s -> 9040.48s]  It's kind of like another dog with horns.
[9041.43s -> 9043.07s]  This is a German shepherd with horns.
[9043.27s -> 9046.18s]  What is this? A pronghorn?
[9048.15s -> 9049.51s]  Rabbits are pretty cool.
[9050.53s -> 9052.05s]  Raccoons are really cool.
[9053.26s -> 9054.18s]  Rats are rest here.
[9054.38s -> 9056.50s]  We'll mess with this in a little bit.
[9056.70s -> 9057.98s]  This thing's kind of cool.
[9058.35s -> 9059.75s]  Sea lions are kind of cool.
[9061.47s -> 9063.35s]  Seals are kind of, seals are all right.
[9063.51s -> 9067.55s]  I like when they go like this and their whole head kind of stuffs into their neck.
[9068.76s -> 9071.16s]  A shrew. Oh, yeah. Shrew is up here.
[9072.05s -> 9073.61s]  Skunks are fun.
[9074.56s -> 9078.84s]  Squirrels are cool, but it's just like it's an oversaturated market for squirrels.
[9078.84s -> 9079.44s]  You know what I mean?
[9079.64s -> 9081.56s]  It's not interesting to see a squirrel,
[9081.76s -> 9084.00s]  even though they're really cool and they're really funny.
[9084.20s -> 9090.10s]  It's a very oversaturated market, I think.
[9090.30s -> 9091.50s]  Vols are cool.
[9091.70s -> 9093.26s]  I don't know if they're est here, though.
[9095.43s -> 9096.63s]  Weasels are est here.
[9097.71s -> 9099.99s]  Walruses are kind of like, I don't know, weird to me.
[9100.03s -> 9102.23s]  Wolf is, I mean, it's just like so easy.
[9102.86s -> 9104.94s]  Wolverine is just so angry, it's funny.
[9105.38s -> 9109.09s]  OK, let's get this accurate.
[9114.33s -> 9115.61s]  Which one is your fursona?
[9115.98s -> 9117.06s]  It's one of these in est here.
[9119.87s -> 9121.75s]  Armadillo versus rat.
[9122.83s -> 9124.71s]  Armadillo versus otter.
[9124.91s -> 9126.23s]  Yeah, Armadillo is cool.
[9129.10s -> 9131.34s]  I think skunks are funnier than black bears.
[9131.54s -> 9136.50s]  I don't know why. Mole, weasel, possum.
[9137.00s -> 9139.72s]  Whale, I think, comes up high like here.
[9142.98s -> 9147.55s]  All right. Mouse, antity, chipmunk.
[9149.02s -> 9151.06s]  Orca, orca and whale.
[9151.94s -> 9153.22s]  It's just so huge and hulking.
[9153.42s -> 9154.58s]  It's so interesting.
[9156.88s -> 9158.56s]  Where's Wolverine? Wolverine has to come up.
[9158.76s -> 9167.10s]  Yeah, well, that's not fair.
[9167.86s -> 9170.42s]  I'm basing the opinion of bringing the fox up,
[9170.50s -> 9172.22s]  not because I want to be the contrarian,
[9172.42s -> 9175.06s]  but because of that video of the fox going like,
[9178.51s -> 9180.23s]  that's such a cute video.
[9180.43s -> 9181.15s]  I love it.
[9182.62s -> 9184.42s]  It's like one of the cutest videos ever.
[9185.30s -> 9188.94s]  The fox is so happy and just like, it's like,
[9189.14s -> 9194.94s]  man, it starts like just making noise and it's so happy.
[9195.06s -> 9199.70s]  They're about to get a treat and they're just like, oh, my God, yay.
[9204.69s -> 9207.17s]  What do you mean, what? You guys have not seen that video?
[9211.45s -> 9212.37s]  The video is so good.
[9212.37s -> 9214.45s]  Yeah. How many of you guys have not seen that video?
[9216.04s -> 9218.24s]  I'm supposed to be the one that doesn't know anything about the Internet.
[9218.44s -> 9220.04s]  You guys are supposed to know all this.
[9224.90s -> 9226.70s]  OK, rabbit. Yeah, I think this is good.
[9226.90s -> 9227.86s]  I don't think I need to change anything.
[9228.06s -> 9230.86s]  You can probably tell that I think most of the animals and horns are kind
[9231.06s -> 9232.66s]  of interesting, but not really.
[9234.38s -> 9235.74s]  They always do this.
[9235.94s -> 9241.32s]  OK, the horned animals are like the Ford truck commercial
[9241.32s -> 9242.76s]  of the animal world.
[9242.96s -> 9247.56s]  They always have they always take the same picture of them sideways turned head,
[9247.76s -> 9252.60s]  like looking in the camera, like sideways profile head turned.
[9256.11s -> 9258.39s]  It's I feel like it's like a car commercial.
[9258.59s -> 9259.59s]  It's just a model pose.
[9259.79s -> 9263.73s]  Yeah, I think my drink is leaking.
[9263.93s -> 9265.37s]  You just have to drink it faster.
[9267.02s -> 9268.86s]  Oh, American made.
[9269.94s -> 9271.62s]  Yeah, this is what I think of.
[9276.86s -> 9278.26s]  These things are going to start to leak.
[9279.15s -> 9280.83s]  It's starting to kind of compress on itself.
[9281.03s -> 9281.95s]  I don't know why.
[9282.52s -> 9283.68s]  All right, there you go.
[9287.47s -> 9288.19s]  Animal tearless.
[9288.39s -> 9293.43s]  That means my fursona is an armadillo or a rat or an otter or a skunk.
[9294.77s -> 9295.77s]  I don't want to be a skunk, though.
[9295.97s -> 9297.33s]  I think I would be an armadillo.
[9299.43s -> 9300.27s]  What's next?
[9300.71s -> 9303.91s]  Uh, he's a fast food mascots.
[9304.11s -> 9305.47s]  I could beat in a fight.
[9312.82s -> 9318.80s]  OK, well, I'm going to tell you right off the bat, I'm just going to stomp this guy.
[9319.00s -> 9322.80s]  You know what I mean? I'm just one shoe print is going to instantly kill
[9322.80s -> 9324.84s]  and break every bone in this thing's body.
[9326.07s -> 9327.31s]  This is going to be like
[9327.51s -> 9329.71s]  this and it's going to be squished.
[9332.33s -> 9333.53s]  So that's guaranteed.
[9336.46s -> 9337.82s]  Wendy, I'm not so sure.
[9338.46s -> 9340.26s]  I think I get I think I get beat up, Wendy.
[9340.76s -> 9341.40s]  Hmm.
[9342.54s -> 9343.74s]  You might kick the shit out of me, though.
[9350.58s -> 9353.54s]  I feel like I would I might actually get my ass kicked from Wendy.
[9356.35s -> 9359.23s]  I would not be prepared for what Wendy would do.
[9359.43s -> 9362.51s]  Like, I feel like she would come with like a fucking pitchfork or something.
[9368.84s -> 9370.04s]  Wendy's 12.
[9377.90s -> 9381.06s]  Well, what would you like me to say about the baby then?
[9381.26s -> 9383.74s]  What do you want to say about the baby?
[9385.34s -> 9390.82s]  What should we say about the bit, the literal infant baby on this list?
[9391.02s -> 9402.57s]  OK, this guy's going to kill me.
[9402.61s -> 9404.09s]  I'm just I've already died.
[9404.29s -> 9406.37s]  The Quaker Road guys fucking kill me.
[9407.51s -> 9409.47s]  Why and punch? I'm just going through the happily.
[9409.67s -> 9412.75s]  OK, the Happy Meal Guy, the Happy Meal Guy.
[9412.95s -> 9420.97s]  I would just go like this and like fold them and just crush them.
[9421.17s -> 9422.41s]  This flight involved here.
[9422.61s -> 9424.49s]  I don't like I love bees.
[9424.49s -> 9425.89s]  I love what they do for the environment.
[9426.09s -> 9428.73s]  I need to protect bees at all costs.
[9428.89s -> 9435.54s]  But if one bee gets like too close to me, I'm going to go like this and fucking run.
[9435.74s -> 9437.54s]  So I don't know.
[9437.74s -> 9439.30s]  I'm not sure if I would be able to do it.
[9443.32s -> 9449.96s]  These these these three little guys here, they could they could be anywhere.
[9450.53s -> 9455.57s]  I feel like this big like this big and they OK, not only are they small,
[9456.01s -> 9459.41s]  but they have like sentience, like human sentience.
[9459.61s -> 9461.41s]  They're like intelligent beings, right?
[9462.68s -> 9464.60s]  They could literally just poison my drink.
[9467.41s -> 9471.05s]  Yeah, they could come in with like a cyanide capsule and fucking just like
[9471.13s -> 9473.89s]  heave it up there, get up there and dump it into like my coffee.
[9474.09s -> 9475.53s]  I would lose. Absolutely.
[9478.46s -> 9480.98s]  Tony the Tiger is not is not going to be a fight.
[9482.90s -> 9484.54s]  Tony the Tiger would destroy me.
[9491.50s -> 9494.50s]  OK, this is like a this is like a old revolutionary guy, right?
[9494.50s -> 9495.90s]  I feel like this guy would just shoot me.
[9498.65s -> 9498.97s]  Chuck E.
[9499.17s -> 9500.33s]  Cheese, that's a fair fight.
[9504.16s -> 9506.16s]  Why is the jelly bean even on this list?
[9508.39s -> 9510.91s]  You it would be I would just eat them.
[9511.42s -> 9513.50s]  It's like, oh, you are you want to fight?
[9515.28s -> 9517.40s]  And then I go, oh, you were popcorn.
[9517.44s -> 9523.26s]  Oh, Bakers were pacifists.
[9523.46s -> 9529.01s]  Wait, they were. Oh, I'm getting deja vu.
[9529.01s -> 9537.30s]  Do we have the same conversation like three years ago?
[9537.50s -> 9539.52s]  We did the same thing.
[9541.05s -> 9542.89s]  We did the same thing.
[9544.03s -> 9545.47s]  Did I do the same list?
[9545.47s -> 9547.31s]  Why am I acting like this is so different?
[9549.61s -> 9552.57s]  Mr. Peanut, easy.
[9556.21s -> 9558.73s]  Grimace, this is I don't know, Grimace.
[9558.93s -> 9561.73s]  Grimace, I feel like doesn't have very much access to his hands.
[9561.93s -> 9565.45s]  So all it would take would be like a full sprint drop kick right into his stomach
[9565.49s -> 9568.05s]  and he would just tumble off a cliff and he'd be over.
[9569.00s -> 9575.32s]  So I think I would I would think I would destroy Grimace.
[9575.52s -> 9576.84s]  Hmm.
[9589.31s -> 9594.15s]  I could beat I could be I could absolutely be the Lucky Charms leprechaun.
[9596.70s -> 9598.62s]  Again, we have the same problem here.
[9599.26s -> 9603.01s]  The same problem here. I could just get poisoned.
[9603.21s -> 9604.57s]  I could just get poisoned.
[9604.77s -> 9606.13s]  It's just a cyanide pill.
[9606.33s -> 9607.69s]  They're like this tall, right?
[9612.54s -> 9613.90s]  I would be in big trouble.
[9614.92s -> 9616.32s]  Poison isn't a fight.
[9616.52s -> 9617.52s]  What do you mean?
[9621.29s -> 9623.33s]  I was wait, it's not which one of these
[9623.33s -> 9625.33s]  could like murder you in your sleep.
[9625.53s -> 9626.49s]  It's fight.
[9626.99s -> 9635.32s]  Oh, oh, OK.
[9635.52s -> 9638.64s]  Then, yeah, I would just it would be pretty easy.
[9642.79s -> 9644.51s]  I guess that would be very easy.
[9645.72s -> 9647.80s]  What's the point of this whole list?
[9648.00s -> 9655.37s]  This is an old man like
[9655.57s -> 9657.97s]  nobody on this list could stand a chance
[9658.17s -> 9661.09s]  besides Tony the Tiger and maybe Chef Boyardee.
[9665.69s -> 9668.17s]  You can't say he has flight, which is very important.
[9669.82s -> 9673.82s]  This is just another another like this is like another little kid.
[9674.71s -> 9676.31s]  What's the difference between these two?
[9681.42s -> 9686.44s]  What's the difference? We already did this.
[9686.64s -> 9689.03s]  I don't need to do this again.
[9689.23s -> 9690.03s]  This is a cow.
[9690.23s -> 9694.54s]  So I don't I mean, I feel like I could get like really fucked up.
[9696.39s -> 9700.36s]  This is a this is a cheetah, which I would be.
[9700.56s -> 9703.20s]  All right. What's more dangerous, a tiger or a cheetah?
[9703.77s -> 9706.17s]  By the way, like a cracked out cheetah.
[9707.95s -> 9712.39s]  Tony the Tiger is like fit and he wants to help and he wants you to go
[9712.59s -> 9716.15s]  and have a great time and go out inside and play soccer.
[9716.79s -> 9718.31s]  This guy's like Cheetos.
[9718.51s -> 9720.75s]  Yeah, like this guy's fucked.
[9721.45s -> 9726.78s]  I don't know about this guy junk food, motherfuckers like this.
[9726.98s -> 9729.22s]  Yeah, this guy's an absolute this is mayhem.
[9729.42s -> 9731.46s]  I would be this is S tier for sure.
[9739.14s -> 9739.86s]  Who's this?
[9740.06s -> 9743.34s]  I mean, I would I would annihilate you.
[9743.54s -> 9745.02s]  This is the Taco Bell dog.
[9745.90s -> 9749.74s]  This is very important because there is a very high chance that they could be
[9749.94s -> 9753.30s]  a 90s comedy scene where he like bites my balls.
[9753.87s -> 9757.67s]  Right. And I got to be like, oh, the dog that this could be very, very difficult.
[9765.15s -> 9766.47s]  Keebler elves goodbye.
[9766.67s -> 9767.67s]  Eminem's goodbye.
[9767.87s -> 9769.79s]  They're just like they're like an inch tall.
[9771.83s -> 9773.03s]  Why are you on here twice?
[9773.23s -> 9776.55s]  I would kill both hands, your left and your right.
[9779.10s -> 9781.42s]  Ronald McDonald, I would put up here.
[9781.99s -> 9785.34s]  Yeah, I don't know why.
[9785.54s -> 9789.50s]  I'm just imagining Ronald McDonald with a pissed face
[9790.01s -> 9794.09s]  in like in like a candid TikTok video for some reason,
[9794.29s -> 9797.75s]  like just slapping me in the fucking face,
[9798.58s -> 9801.10s]  like on like somebody's filming it like on TikTok or something.
[9801.56s -> 9803.56s]  Like I'm just I don't know why I just imagining me sitting there like,
[9803.56s -> 9804.64s]  fuck you, you piece of shit.
[9804.84s -> 9807.62s]  And he just goes like, and I go up.
[9810.10s -> 9811.70s]  Yeah. So he'd win.
[9813.23s -> 9820.48s]  He would kick the shit out of me because this happened.
[9831.67s -> 9836.63s]  Oh, the Kool-Aid man, I he's got size,
[9836.83s -> 9840.59s]  but I would absolutely beat them because he just made it a glass.
[9842.38s -> 9845.30s]  I would just pick up a rock and throw it as hard as I could.
[9845.50s -> 9854.09s]  And it would just Kool-Aid man is also like cracked out.
[9854.29s -> 9855.09s]  It doesn't know.
[9855.29s -> 9857.17s]  But the Kool-Aid man's made it a glass.
[9859.34s -> 9861.06s]  He's made it a bulletproof glass.
[9861.26s -> 9864.65s]  Where do you who said that he breaks through walls?
[9864.85s -> 9866.05s]  Oh, shit, he does.
[9866.25s -> 9868.09s]  That's a that's a big problem.
[9876.21s -> 9879.61s]  I feel like like the Hawaiian punch in the stomach would probably hurt.
[9879.61s -> 9882.49s]  But that would just probably just drop, kick him after that.
[9886.51s -> 9887.63s]  I think I could do it.
[9888.46s -> 9890.86s]  Oh, here's another like this is not like racked out guy.
[9890.86s -> 9891.94s]  You know what I mean?
[9893.14s -> 9895.70s]  I don't know if he's higher that he's up here.
[9897.36s -> 9900.16s]  This is somebody that when they eat chocolate, they turn to like it's like
[9900.36s -> 9901.80s]  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[9903.22s -> 9906.50s]  So if I kept chocolate away from the cocoa puffs bird,
[9906.70s -> 9908.06s]  I think I would be able to do it.
[9908.26s -> 9910.38s]  But if he like Popeye, the sailor man,
[9910.58s -> 9915.78s]  spinach like crushed like a chocolate bar in his mouth, I'm going to run.
[9918.52s -> 9920.20s]  That's up in the air. I'm not sure.
[9924.99s -> 9926.27s]  Sun of raisins.
[9926.47s -> 9932.89s]  OK, I think that'd be pretty.
[9933.09s -> 9934.05s]  Hmm.
[9944.54s -> 9945.42s]  Farmers are ripped.
[9945.62s -> 9948.38s]  Yeah, that's why I'm sitting here thinking about this.
[9956.37s -> 9959.05s]  But you're like out in like the sun.
[9959.05s -> 9961.01s]  You're out like where you're doing stuff.
[9961.01s -> 9966.41s]  I'm such like a soft, supple, like fucking blob person at this point.
[9967.68s -> 9969.68s]  I would probably crumble in one fucking hit.
[9972.23s -> 9975.63s]  I have like my stomach like is
[9976.01s -> 9978.61s]  made out of it's like shakes now.
[9986.92s -> 9993.09s]  I would probably lose.
[9993.29s -> 10003.26s]  It would probably lose, especially if you caught me on like you're dead.
[10005.04s -> 10006.76s]  No, it would be fair. It would be a fair fight.
[10006.80s -> 10007.52s]  No, it wouldn't.
[10016.98s -> 10019.34s]  You're supple. Well, I mean, just like my supple.
[10019.54s -> 10021.70s]  What I don't have words to describe.
[10022.72s -> 10023.80s]  There you go.
[10024.75s -> 10030.47s]  Is the list of food mascots I could beat in a fight a tier list maker.
[10034.05s -> 10035.93s]  M&Ms are human sized.
[10036.56s -> 10037.68s]  No, they're not.
[10038.44s -> 10041.16s]  What are you talking about?
[10041.36s -> 10044.00s]  A human sized M&M is just grimace.
[10044.00s -> 10045.16s]  That's not what you know.
[10045.36s -> 10046.56s]  That's wrong. What?
[10046.76s -> 10048.32s]  No, it's not.
[10052.34s -> 10053.54s]  He does exist.
[10053.74s -> 10055.38s]  They do exist.
[10055.58s -> 10057.62s]  They're like up to his shin.
[10057.82s -> 10059.66s]  They're not even up to his knees, guys.
[10059.74s -> 10061.58s]  In that Santa Claus commercial.
[10061.78s -> 10063.50s]  What are you talking about?
[10063.70s -> 10065.66s]  They're not human size.
[10065.86s -> 10068.58s]  They're tiny. They're like two feet tall.
[10072.67s -> 10073.55s]  Santa's huge.
[10073.75s -> 10077.22s]  Santa's not like 15 feet tall.
[10077.42s -> 10078.42s]  Sorry, Santa.
[10078.62s -> 10080.02s]  Santa's not as tall as a monster.
[10080.22s -> 10082.18s]  OK, Santa's not as tall as a monster.
[10082.38s -> 10083.38s]  All right.
[10083.88s -> 10084.88s]  Come on.
[10085.08s -> 10086.36s]  You guys trying to say that?
[10088.34s -> 10090.90s]  Yes, he is. Santa is not fucking 30 feet tall.
[10093.96s -> 10095.04s]  No, he's not.
[10095.61s -> 10097.49s]  I'm going to write how tall is.
[10097.99s -> 10100.99s]  How tall is Santa?
[10105.78s -> 10116.54s]  How tall is he? He's 6'6".
[10116.74s -> 10118.86s]  OK, but if you're 6'6",
[10119.06s -> 10122.90s]  somebody that's of M&M's come up to his shins.
[10123.72s -> 10126.68s]  We're watching that fucking commercial and I'm going to put this to rest.
[10133.78s -> 10135.06s]  Oh, yeah, they're human sized.
[10135.06s -> 10137.66s]  They're not even to the base of the Christmas tree.
[10148.85s -> 10151.74s]  This ad is not canon.
[10151.94s -> 10155.24s]  Oh, please.
[10155.44s -> 10156.64s]  I'm putting it on here.
[10158.49s -> 10159.77s]  What do you mean not canon?
[10166.86s -> 10168.64s]  You guys ready?
[10168.84s -> 10189.70s]  Don't listen to that ad.
[10190.94s -> 10194.50s]  OK, you ready?
[10200.45s -> 10201.93s]  Look at them. It's a pissed eye look.
[10201.93s -> 10208.07s]  I'm like, all right, we're going to watch this
[10208.07s -> 10211.19s]  because I want to prove once and for all that you guys are completely wrong.
[10214.96s -> 10217.38s]  So what we have here.
[10217.58s -> 10219.54s]  Stop. Can you see it?
[10219.54s -> 10220.62s]  No, you can't see it.
[10223.68s -> 10237.73s]  Let's find out how tall the M&M's are.
[10239.45s -> 10240.37s]  I don't know.
[10240.57s -> 10242.61s]  I never met the guy.
[10242.98s -> 10244.22s]  OK,
[10244.42s -> 10249.62s]  explain to me how this guy that's 6'6", he's six feet tall, six and a half feet
[10249.62s -> 10257.55s]  tall. So if you go up one foot or these guys are like maybe nine to ten,
[10257.75s -> 10264.16s]  like 12 inches tall.
[10264.36s -> 10266.04s]  We exist.
[10267.82s -> 10273.26s]  And by the way, all it took was for them to see Santa Claus and he fainted.
[10274.28s -> 10276.76s]  I would kick the shit out of these two.
[10277.58s -> 10280.18s]  Are you kidding me? Imagine meeting German 985.
[10281.52s -> 10282.76s]  Imagine you meet me.
[10283.33s -> 10284.81s]  Well, German 985.
[10285.01s -> 10295.18s]  Oh, I rest my case.
[10295.38s -> 10305.06s]  So, oh, my God, he does exist.
[10305.22s -> 10306.62s]  Do exist.
[10310.58s -> 10312.22s]  That's what I would do. I wouldn't faint.
[10321.69s -> 10322.85s]  Why is it so bright in my room?
[10322.85s -> 10323.77s]  I hate cameras.
[10337.78s -> 10339.14s]  All right, we did this.
[10339.34s -> 10342.38s]  Let's go. This one is Super Mario characters.
[10342.58s -> 10344.22s]  Every one tier list.
[10346.77s -> 10355.13s]  I'm not doing this. This is too much.
[10355.33s -> 10356.61s]  This is so many.
[10358.46s -> 10359.34s]  Can I skip this one?
[10359.54s -> 10363.03s]  I mean, look, everyone is here.
[10363.23s -> 10367.15s]  Yeah. Wait, why?
[10367.35s -> 10368.35s]  Why King K.
[10368.35s -> 10370.03s]  Rule? Yeah. Why is he on here?
[10370.66s -> 10371.82s]  Please don't do this one.
[10372.02s -> 10373.42s]  This is going to take a million years.
[10376.30s -> 10377.22s]  Maybe we'll come back to it.
[10377.42s -> 10380.80s]  It's a lot.
[10381.00s -> 10383.72s]  Thanksgiving food tier list.
[10384.99s -> 10385.95s]  I can do this one.
[10388.82s -> 10389.86s]  We'll save it. We'll save it.
[10390.06s -> 10394.63s]  I look, I'll go back if people still want me to do it.
[10394.83s -> 10396.39s]  All right, let's go. Easy.
[10399.14s -> 10403.98s]  In fact, this is so easy that this is the only thing that's up here.
[10404.18s -> 10405.70s]  It's on a complete other level.
[10406.07s -> 10409.75s]  Stuffing is on another level than every other food item at Thanksgiving.
[10410.26s -> 10412.51s]  A stamp on it.
[10412.71s -> 10414.86s]  Pumpkin pie. Yuck.
[10415.55s -> 10417.35s]  Apple pie. Yuck.
[10417.79s -> 10419.79s]  Biscuits. Very high.
[10421.73s -> 10423.37s]  Brussels sprouts.
[10423.57s -> 10435.41s]  Squash made no jellied cranberry jellied cranberry.
[10435.41s -> 10437.57s]  They whoever made this list, you know what you're talking about.
[10437.77s -> 10439.41s]  Cranberry sauce. Get out of here.
[10442.09s -> 10443.41s]  Is this a green bean casserole?
[10443.41s -> 10444.41s]  That's also up here.
[10445.55s -> 10446.87s]  One bread that's also up here.
[10448.02s -> 10449.70s]  This is going to be close.
[10451.93s -> 10453.61s]  Corn.
[10453.81s -> 10457.83s]  Hmm. Creamed corn.
[10461.15s -> 10463.03s]  How would dinner dinner rolls?
[10463.41s -> 10465.37s]  No, I want the biscuits and I want the cornbread.
[10465.74s -> 10467.93s]  Gravy. That's OK.
[10468.75s -> 10471.19s]  Ham. No, I don't want ham.
[10471.53s -> 10473.25s]  Mac and cheese. It's up there.
[10473.29s -> 10475.29s]  That's all right. Mashed potatoes.
[10475.49s -> 10478.10s]  You better believe it. Red wine.
[10478.30s -> 10482.03s]  No hard pass. No, no.
[10482.54s -> 10484.90s]  I don't understand this whole pair alcohol with shit.
[10484.98s -> 10486.70s]  No, I want to drink alcohol separately.
[10490.72s -> 10491.76s]  I don't I don't get it.
[10493.74s -> 10496.62s]  I don't want to drink like I would give me like a sprite.
[10496.82s -> 10500.74s]  Well, I'll say I was like a glass of milk over a red wine at dinner.
[10501.37s -> 10503.09s]  I don't like drinking. I love wine.
[10503.29s -> 10506.57s]  Don't get me wrong. Red wine is est here for me and alcohol.
[10507.97s -> 10509.93s]  And I would pair it with this meat.
[10509.93s -> 10511.05s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[10513.41s -> 10514.65s]  I feel like you're just making that up.
[10516.11s -> 10520.88s]  Do you feel like the people just make that up, that they just go like, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[10521.08s -> 10522.70s]  And that's that piece of steak.
[10522.90s -> 10524.70s]  Yes. Oh, that that that.
[10524.90s -> 10528.78s]  Wow. I feel like you're just making it up to like seem sophisticated.
[10531.08s -> 10531.92s]  I've done that before.
[10531.92s -> 10532.40s]  And it's just like this.
[10532.40s -> 10534.84s]  I just like I just drank wine after eating like a piece of meat.
[10538.22s -> 10539.18s]  And guess what I did?
[10540.20s -> 10542.00s]  Guess what I did after I did that?
[10544.10s -> 10545.26s]  Oh, yeah. Oh, no.
[10545.26s -> 10546.46s]  That pairs very well.
[10546.46s -> 10548.22s]  That pair. You know what I want to try?
[10548.38s -> 10549.78s]  I want to try that with the fish.
[10549.90s -> 10551.42s]  I want to try that with the fish.
[10551.62s -> 10552.78s]  It's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[10552.82s -> 10553.66s]  You're making this up.
[10555.58s -> 10558.78s]  I have done this at least a handful of times before.
[10564.40s -> 10570.92s]  And then you're at dinner and you tell other people and you don't give a shit
[10570.92s -> 10573.72s]  about any of this, but you just do because then that person thinks you know what
[10573.72s -> 10577.44s]  you're talking about because you've like had that experience before where it's like,
[10577.64s -> 10580.97s]  oh, you get you're getting the chicken.
[10582.11s -> 10582.83s]  Let me tell you something.
[10583.40s -> 10584.88s]  I'd recommend a Malbec.
[10585.08s -> 10586.28s]  I'd recommend a Malbec.
[10587.68s -> 10588.80s]  It's like, oh, wow.
[10589.00s -> 10591.89s]  You you you know why you must die.
[10591.89s -> 10593.25s]  You're much more sophisticated.
[10593.29s -> 10594.37s]  I thought you just ate McDonald's,
[10594.57s -> 10598.01s]  McChickens and ate Capri's drink Capri's son juice boxes.
[10598.21s -> 10599.90s]  No, I do more.
[10602.19s -> 10602.99s]  I just don't get it.
[10603.19s -> 10605.27s]  Maybe call me like uncultured weirdo.
[10605.47s -> 10607.39s]  I I want to drink wine.
[10607.83s -> 10610.23s]  I have a bottle just like drink it.
[10611.50s -> 10615.02s]  I don't I don't want like to have you want some wine at dinner.
[10615.22s -> 10617.93s]  Oh, here you go, sir.
[10618.82s -> 10620.30s]  OK, great.
[10620.50s -> 10621.46s]  What am I supposed to do with this?
[10623.62s -> 10624.58s]  What am I supposed to do with that?
[10628.61s -> 10629.69s]  Thanks for the sip of wine.
[10629.89s -> 10633.17s]  That'll be like that'll be like $19, by the way.
[10635.74s -> 10638.14s]  The whole meal was like fucking 20 bucks.
[10650.23s -> 10652.35s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I could see that.
[10652.55s -> 10653.87s]  I could see that with a casserole.
[10660.90s -> 10662.34s]  Let's backtrack a little bit.
[10662.34s -> 10663.42s]  If you like, like what?
[10663.42s -> 10668.86s]  No, no, I'm not backtracking on this one.
[10669.06s -> 10673.57s]  Roasted vegetables, pretty good scallop potatoes.
[10673.57s -> 10674.85s]  Holy shit. Absolutely.
[10675.67s -> 10676.63s]  Sparkling juice.
[10677.84s -> 10681.72s]  Yep, that I don't have to pretend with that one.
[10682.67s -> 10684.95s]  It's just like it's sparkling like grape juice.
[10685.15s -> 10687.31s]  And I go, oh, my God, this is great.
[10687.31s -> 10688.07s]  I love this.
[10689.86s -> 10695.75s]  I don't have to take the sparkling grape juice and go, oh, oh, yeah.
[10695.83s -> 10698.51s]  Oh, no, just give me the fucking goddamn grape juice.
[10698.63s -> 10699.67s]  I don't you know what I mean?
[10703.82s -> 10705.06s]  Sweet potato casserole.
[10705.06s -> 10706.06s]  It's all right. It's good.
[10711.24s -> 10713.56s]  Fuck you. You put dinner rolls at a hard pass.
[10713.76s -> 10716.74s]  Well, because I there's only enough real
[10716.94s -> 10721.85s]  estate on your your plate to have dinner rolls, biscuits.
[10721.85s -> 10725.17s]  They take up a lot of real estate because they're kind of they're a bit like solid
[10725.37s -> 10728.93s]  shape and they have to like you really want like more than one or two.
[10729.13s -> 10730.25s]  But they kind of slide around.
[10730.25s -> 10731.21s]  They take a lot of space.
[10733.57s -> 10735.41s]  I like everything separated, by the way.
[10735.61s -> 10738.26s]  When I go for Thanksgiving dinner and
[10738.42s -> 10741.62s]  if I like somebody made it because I don't fucking do that.
[10741.82s -> 10743.34s]  I fucking don't know how to cook.
[10743.54s -> 10746.66s]  I don't know. I'm not a good like if my mother would make Thanksgiving dinner,
[10747.30s -> 10749.08s]  it's not going to be me.
[10750.16s -> 10752.40s]  I'm going to go separate everything.
[10753.03s -> 10754.55s]  You go up more than once.
[10754.75s -> 10756.47s]  The people you're at the kids table.
[10756.67s -> 10760.54s]  No, I'm not. I'm a grown up.
[10760.74s -> 10763.74s]  So you go get enough.
[10763.78s -> 10765.26s]  I don't like putting everything on top of each other.
[10765.26s -> 10767.86s]  You look at like, oh, I'll go Jerry over there.
[10768.06s -> 10770.42s]  And he's got a plate this high and he's
[10770.42s -> 10772.62s]  putting stuff on top of the biscuits and shit.
[10773.22s -> 10776.58s]  It's like, just come back like you can come back up again.
[10777.02s -> 10777.78s]  You don't have to do that.
[10778.86s -> 10781.34s]  You know, like, you know, like, oh, here's the big turkey.
[10781.34s -> 10783.22s]  Here's like the biscuits. Here's the cranberry sauce.
[10783.59s -> 10785.43s]  Like Uncle Jerry, you don't have to like
[10785.81s -> 10787.81s]  put everything on the plate at the same time.
[10788.57s -> 10792.71s]  I like having turkey sectioned, stuffing sectioned.
[10793.15s -> 10794.87s]  I have everything has to have its own place.
[10796.85s -> 10799.37s]  I don't like when everything's just mixed together and mashed together.
[10799.37s -> 10800.57s]  No, I like it in its own place.
[10804.14s -> 10804.90s]  It gets too messy.
[10805.92s -> 10807.52s]  Things start to blend into each other.
[10811.29s -> 10813.57s]  I would definitely say that
[10817.78s -> 10818.70s]  I'm going to put this at great.
[10821.00s -> 10826.39s]  Scalloped potatoes, I'd rather have that that's not accurate.
[10827.28s -> 10829.63s]  You put pie in hard pass.
[10829.83s -> 10833.25s]  Banana cream pie is the only pie I like.
[10833.45s -> 10836.45s]  Chocolate cream and banana cream pie are the only two pies that I like to eat.
[10837.08s -> 10838.36s]  I don't like any other pie.
[10839.63s -> 10841.95s]  I'm sorry that everyone doesn't like that.
[10845.14s -> 10846.58s]  Let me put some lip balm on.
[10846.78s -> 10848.90s]  I just realized my eyes have been open for a long time.
[10851.39s -> 10852.71s]  The pie opinion is wrong.
[10853.86s -> 10855.74s]  I just I just don't really like pie.
[10857.01s -> 10859.57s]  I don't like hot pies, like warm pies.
[10860.52s -> 10861.52s]  I'm starting to realize this.
[10863.14s -> 10869.62s]  I know the pumpkin pie isn't necessarily warm, but turn on the music.
[10869.62s -> 10870.54s]  What happened? Did we lose it?
[10873.93s -> 10877.26s]  What about the ice cream? No, no.
[10877.46s -> 10879.54s]  Because the ice cream just like melts and turns into liquid.
[10879.74s -> 10882.10s]  And then it's like you it's weird to scoop it up.
[10882.30s -> 10884.34s]  I don't like it.
[10884.54s -> 10887.08s]  Um, what happened to the Deltarune soundtrack?
[10895.01s -> 10897.11s]  OK, here we go.
[10904.64s -> 10905.64s]  Hard pass on ham.
[10905.84s -> 10907.88s]  Yeah, to me, Thanksgiving's turkey.
[10908.08s -> 10909.88s]  I don't I'd rather not have ham.
[10910.08s -> 10917.93s]  I'm actually not really a ham guy, if I'm honest to crusty lips.
[10917.93s -> 10920.69s]  I know that's why I have to continuously lubricate them.
[10921.01s -> 10922.17s]  I'm aware.
[10924.02s -> 10925.26s]  I think this is good.
[10926.21s -> 10927.25s]  This is good.
[10929.61s -> 10930.85s]  What's up next?
[10932.50s -> 10937.34s]  This one is a create a Christmas movies tier list.

[11258.14s -> 11259.70s]  There's a whole playlist here I can just open.
[11264.55s -> 11265.55s]  We're not on that one yet.
[11265.55s -> 11267.07s]  We're not on Sneaky Snitch yet.
[11273.78s -> 11279.14s]  We're looking for Carefree, Carefree.
[11280.93s -> 11283.01s]  I've used Sneaky Snitch like five times.

[11311.50s -> 11313.34s]  I've sung over this one before.
[11316.98s -> 11318.62s]  OK, good. What about Cypher?
[11324.63s -> 11326.31s]  It's a 10 hour version.
[11329.25s -> 11331.65s]  OK, I would put this one at S,
[11331.65s -> 11335.73s]  but unfortunately, it's been in like 40 percent of every mobile game I've ever
[11335.93s -> 11338.13s]  played, so it's got to come down a little bit.
[11349.96s -> 11353.22s]  I think it's, yeah, right here.
[11361.28s -> 11362.88s]  It's, it's so good, though.
[11363.08s -> 11364.08s]  It's so good.
[11365.54s -> 11366.50s]  All right.
[11366.70s -> 11369.06s]  A Darkest Child.
[11374.30s -> 11380.30s]  OK, this one's a scary one.
[11385.74s -> 11386.50s]  I like it.

[11407.75s -> 11409.19s]  Fluffing a Duck.
[11410.14s -> 11412.54s]  Where's the one that I've heard a million times?

[11417.68s -> 11420.00s]  Yeah, this I've heard this so many times.
[11424.09s -> 11425.69s]  That's up at S.
[11428.05s -> 11430.45s]  God, so many of these just are used
[11430.65s -> 11437.05s]  for when like the vlogger is like moving from like one room to the other.
[11437.25s -> 11438.93s]  Or from, OK, we're going to go do this.
[11439.13s -> 11442.81s]  And there's like a small montage or it's just in the background.
[11443.01s -> 11446.37s]  This is in the background permanently on so many channels.
[11447.58s -> 11451.98s]  I've heard this song so many fucking times.
[11456.83s -> 11458.99s]  I've used this song so many times.

[11483.86s -> 11488.75s]  Eh, it's all right.
[11492.01s -> 11492.85s]  It's OK.
[11495.72s -> 11496.92s]  Yeah, it's all right.
[11497.87s -> 11503.14s]  I guess it could be used for some kind of action sequence, right?
[11504.28s -> 11515.30s]  This one's called a jaunty gumption.
[11516.66s -> 11519.26s]  This is glue man's fucking original entrance music.

[11537.01s -> 11538.01s]  Kind of.

[11544.55s -> 11546.27s]  All right. Local forecast.
[11546.47s -> 11560.23s]  How about that one?
[11562.34s -> 11564.26s]  Oh, this is in so many things, too.

[11575.31s -> 11576.47s]  No, I can't put it in S.
[11576.67s -> 11580.55s]  I've heard it in too many things that traumatized me.
[11587.33s -> 11588.73s]  I'll put it in A.
[11590.90s -> 11592.62s]  OK, this one's called Look Busy.
[11611.87s -> 11628.55s]  This is a classic, but I don't know if it should be up all the way at S.
[11628.75s -> 11629.91s]  It's good. It's good.
[11629.91s -> 11632.31s]  But I put it above this, I think.
[11633.07s -> 11639.60s]  Yeah. OK, Meatball Parade.
[11645.42s -> 11646.94s]  I feel like I know this one.

[11653.89s -> 11655.09s]  Without a doubt.

[11662.33s -> 11664.73s]  streamed Overwatch back in like 2016.
[11672.98s -> 11677.50s]  Yep. OK, that's brap music.
[11678.77s -> 11680.01s]  I don't even know what that means.
[11680.45s -> 11681.97s]  All right. Marigo.
[11687.91s -> 11694.48s]  Marigo.
[11711.88s -> 11713.60s]  No, I hate this one. I hate this one.
[11715.38s -> 11718.58s]  It's not because the music's bad because I've just seen it and heard it so many
[11718.62s -> 11720.30s]  times and play it. Just I don't like it.
[11722.47s -> 11725.23s]  Monkeys spinning monkeys.
[11725.43s -> 11735.27s]  Oh, God.
[11740.84s -> 11753.29s]  I can recite this one by heart, so it has to be up here.
[11763.52s -> 11766.36s]  All right. Pixel Peeker Polka.
[11786.19s -> 11790.93s]  It's good, but it can't beat the classics for me.
[11801.99s -> 11803.11s]  Yeah. OK. Yep.
[11803.31s -> 11804.47s]  I think it belongs there.
[11804.67s -> 11805.79s]  This run amok.
[11805.99s -> 11809.83s]  I feel like this is the ultimate YouTuber one, right?
[11813.82s -> 11816.78s]  This I think this is the ultimate YouTuber song, isn't it?
[11824.45s -> 11831.73s]  I know. Oh, no, no, this is it.
[11831.93s -> 11834.17s]  This is the way this is Glooman.

[11856.73s -> 11864.96s]  And then down down.
[11868.16s -> 11870.44s]  Then it did.
[11871.39s -> 11872.59s]  I don't like that part.
[11874.44s -> 11875.40s]  That's the only part I don't like.
[11876.82s -> 11878.70s]  All right. Scheming weasel.
[11888.81s -> 11890.89s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11903.49s -> 11904.81s]  Does this take over fluffing a duck?
[11904.81s -> 11907.25s]  I think this is I think this is like a better version of fluffing a duck.
[11908.97s -> 11910.33s]  I think we have to change that.
[11919.28s -> 11922.58s]  Yep. OK. Sneaky Adventure.
[11937.62s -> 11949.46s]  This is in the archaeology stream, right?

[11959.06s -> 11960.82s]  Dude, look at this bucket thing. Ready?
[11961.20s -> 11961.84s]  Look at this.
[11963.43s -> 11965.27s]  You see the bottom of this cup.
[11966.67s -> 11972.10s]  It's like starting to get like so wet down here that it's like losing its.
[11975.22s -> 11977.14s]  It's kind of like it's going to come out.
[11977.71s -> 11979.51s]  The bottom is going to fall out of this thing.
[11983.98s -> 11984.86s]  Yeah, look at this.
[11989.66s -> 11991.02s]  It should not be doing this.
[11994.66s -> 11999.18s]  Drink it faster. I'm slowing down as it's all right.
[11999.38s -> 11999.90s]  All right.
[12000.10s -> 12007.48s]  We already know what the sneaky snitch sounds like, but let's just put it up there.
[12007.68s -> 12010.28s]  It's not going to it's going to be lower than I think a lot of you guys think.
[12020.70s -> 12022.30s]  I don't like it.
[12022.94s -> 12027.30s]  I use this song in Otto's dog farts messing up my game.
[12027.50s -> 12028.74s]  And I hate it ever since.
[12033.46s -> 12034.90s]  What a bad video.
[12037.46s -> 12040.14s]  Jesus Christ.
[12040.34s -> 12049.81s]  OK, like I thought to record, put music on that, render it, upload it and publish it.
[12050.44s -> 12051.80s]  I don't know why.
[12053.58s -> 12056.58s]  Why would that you know what it was?
[12057.02s -> 12060.38s]  That was oh, my God, it's been like three days without a video.
[12060.38s -> 12061.82s]  I don't have anything ready.
[12062.52s -> 12063.88s]  I need to do something.
[12065.02s -> 12066.14s]  Sometimes that would happen.
[12067.54s -> 12070.90s]  Yeah, that that's the YouTuber panic mode where it's been four days.
[12073.07s -> 12076.64s]  I have to upload something that really
[12076.76s -> 12080.05s]  only happened like maybe 10 times total.
[12083.30s -> 12090.47s]  And then after like after like 2013, 2014, I did not really give a shit about that
[12090.67s -> 12093.82s]  anymore. And it was smite gameplay.
[12094.02s -> 12094.90s]  Yeah. Watch that.
[12095.10s -> 12100.49s]  Watch it. Delete it on stream.
[12100.69s -> 12114.37s]  I don't want to watch this video.
[12120.25s -> 12123.36s]  It's two minutes.
[12125.01s -> 12127.61s]  I'm only going to stomach this video for like 30 seconds, I think.
[12130.80s -> 12133.12s]  If you want to eat healthy and feel your best.
[12133.32s -> 12135.04s]  That's not my video.
[12143.29s -> 12157.50s]  All right. I'm willing to give this 30 seconds because the music
[12161.10s -> 12162.58s]  and ally has been.

[12180.74s -> 12184.43s]  I have to like accept this for what happened.
[12184.63s -> 12187.87s]  It's not like I can just get up and like walk away right now.
[12188.75s -> 12192.51s]  Seriously, man, this is horrendous.
[12193.27s -> 12194.35s]  It's the whole video.

[12206.91s -> 12208.19s]  Oh, you don't even need my help.

[12217.75s -> 12218.99s]  Right, go on.
[12219.19s -> 12221.35s]  Yes, shoo.
[12221.55s -> 12223.95s]  Dude, can you can you imagine if I just like
[12224.07s -> 12226.15s]  if you guys both died right there?
[12226.53s -> 12227.65s]  I'll try.
[12227.85s -> 12230.34s]  What?
[12230.86s -> 12232.30s]  No, that was miles away.
[12232.50s -> 12233.90s]  Boston wore off with age.
[12234.10s -> 12236.66s]  Yeah, it did. What?
[12236.86s -> 12241.14s]  Especially since moving to like three years ago, I was losing it a little bit,
[12241.34s -> 12245.06s]  but then it was it's almost still pops up now and then.
[12247.35s -> 12249.63s]  No, no, I just saw her.
[12249.83s -> 12251.31s]  You're dead. You are dead.
[12251.51s -> 12252.99s]  Yeah.
[12253.19s -> 12254.67s]  Fucking dog.
[12257.35s -> 12260.51s]  Oh, blame the dog for your bad.
[12261.19s -> 12263.23s]  Your dog didn't like fart in my face.
[12263.43s -> 12265.11s]  Like that would not have happened.
[12265.31s -> 12266.67s]  I didn't like poop.
[12266.87s -> 12269.11s]  No, he didn't. He's right here.
[12269.62s -> 12271.30s]  Have you like checked the floor?
[12271.50s -> 12276.33s]  No, there's no like, oh,
[12276.53s -> 12278.25s]  that like completely threw my game off.
[12278.25s -> 12280.49s]  We were doing like, oh, actually, we killed him.
[12280.69s -> 12282.45s]  But I was doing like well.
[12282.45s -> 12285.69s]  And then the dog farted in my face and it was just over.
[12287.09s -> 12288.37s]  That's the entire video.
[12289.90s -> 12291.50s]  Is it say, did you like that video?
[12291.50s -> 12293.58s]  Make sure you like like the video if you did.
[12296.54s -> 12298.50s]  Oh, I lost. Oh, what the fuck, dog?
[12298.50s -> 12299.82s]  Well, I can't believe you did that.
[12300.02s -> 12301.22s]  Please, God, upload a video.
[12301.98s -> 12303.62s]  It's funny. It's it's funny enough.
[12303.82s -> 12314.68s]  It could go up. Terrible video.
[12314.88s -> 12323.06s]  Apologize to Otto.
[12326.67s -> 12327.95s]  Did he actually fart?
[12328.15s -> 12329.51s]  You think I made it up?
[12329.95s -> 12333.19s]  I made that whole thing up for like the video?
[12333.39s -> 12336.05s]  No,
[12336.25s -> 12337.97s]  it would have been so stupid.
[12340.14s -> 12346.44s]  That was, yeah, it's called uncensored.
[12349.22s -> 12357.42s]  Back when swearing, I was concerned about Jesus Christ.
[12358.63s -> 12360.19s]  I didn't pretend it really happened.
[12360.19s -> 12363.86s]  It did. And what happened to your voice?
[12364.06s -> 12372.72s]  Well, I have a new old mic from like almost 10 years ago and I've aged 10 years.
[12378.47s -> 12380.59s]  Well, that that guy is so funny.
[12380.79s -> 12385.51s]  Where did you find this guy?
[12385.71s -> 12387.51s]  Not even watching VODs from last year.
[12387.51s -> 12388.55s]  You sound different.
[12390.14s -> 12392.90s]  I also got like an Excel, a GoXLR, too.
[12392.90s -> 12394.42s]  I remember when I changed over to the GoXLR,
[12394.42s -> 12396.62s]  everyone was like, what the fuck happened to your voice?
[12396.78s -> 12398.70s]  That was like a year and a half ago, two years ago.
[12399.08s -> 12403.50s]  Yeah, I changed like my setup.
[12403.94s -> 12408.28s]  I had a different mic and everything, so I missed the old German's voice.
[12408.28s -> 12410.88s]  Well, it's never coming back because apparently I've got like all kinds of
[12411.08s -> 12414.88s]  sinus and throat weird issues on top of my other medical problems.
[12414.88s -> 12415.92s]  I'm just I'm getting old.
[12415.92s -> 12417.68s]  I'm so I'm going to start talking like this.
[12417.88s -> 12420.24s]  Once I start talking like this, that's how you know that things are.
[12420.44s -> 12422.12s]  I'm getting a little older.
[12422.32s -> 12426.36s]  This is exactly how I'm going to sound by the time I'm like 55, I think.
[12426.56s -> 12428.32s]  So I'm just it's just going there.
[12430.74s -> 12432.02s]  All right, we'll get a wallpaper.
[12432.22s -> 12442.72s]  Let's watch that one wallpaper.
[12442.92s -> 12443.92s]  OK, let's do it.
[12444.12s -> 12445.20s]  I don't remember this one.
[12445.40s -> 12446.68s]  What is this one?
[12448.89s -> 12451.97s]  Yeah, this one's in every mobile game as well.
[12462.58s -> 12464.26s]  F, I don't think it's F.
[12466.50s -> 12467.74s]  It's just not that high.
[12473.55s -> 12474.99s]  OK, how about there it is?
[12479.85s -> 12483.53s]  What keeps happening to the Deltarune soundtrack?
[12483.73s -> 12484.77s]  I just keep deleting it.
[12486.36s -> 12487.48s]  I was wondering, I was like, where is it?
[12511.28s -> 12514.02s]  Yeah, that's not porn music.
[12516.45s -> 12518.29s]  Who likes to party to wrap it up?
[12518.33s -> 12521.66s]  Let's see.
[12521.86s -> 12529.94s]  This is climbing,
[12536.91s -> 12540.07s]  falling back, it's losing traction.
[12541.09s -> 12543.49s]  Wait, I like that little organ.
[12545.59s -> 12549.53s]  I be there you are.
[12549.73s -> 12553.01s]  There's your Kevin, your Kevin McCloud
[12553.58s -> 12559.16s]  McLeod tier list for royalty free songs.
[12561.97s -> 12562.45s]  There it is.
[12568.26s -> 12569.74s]  Claps very lots of claps.
[12569.94s -> 12580.69s]  Yeah. OK, now difficult games tier list either.
[12580.89s -> 12584.05s]  I have to rate these by impossible to like angry to.
[12584.05s -> 12585.01s]  This is going to be hard.
[12586.98s -> 12588.06s]  Some of these I haven't played.
[12591.45s -> 12592.49s]  All right. Lord of the Rings.
[12592.69s -> 12594.25s]  Fuck this game.
[12594.45s -> 12599.12s]  I would say not that I can't beat it, but it was just stupid.
[12599.20s -> 12600.60s]  OK, that's going all the way up here.
[12601.42s -> 12604.58s]  Cuphead was I got angry, but I was able to do it.
[12604.78s -> 12607.58s]  Jump King was unbearable as well.
[12609.62s -> 12610.90s]  And everyone wanted me to do the DLC.
[12610.90s -> 12611.90s]  I was like, I refuse.
[12612.60s -> 12614.20s]  I absolutely refuse to do the DLC.
[12614.20s -> 12616.42s]  I won't be able to get through it.
[12616.62s -> 12617.70s]  Ikaruga.
[12618.52s -> 12622.22s]  I I don't remember.
[12622.42s -> 12626.09s]  I think I played this for like an hour.
[12629.43s -> 12630.31s]  I don't remember.
[12632.80s -> 12637.18s]  I cheated. Yeah.
[12637.38s -> 12641.75s]  Well, OK, can't beat it to me is like I beat all these games.
[12642.58s -> 12645.54s]  But should this be OK?
[12645.54s -> 12649.14s]  So this should be on the list of like things I actually just did not play.
[12649.34s -> 12650.78s]  You played Ikaruga as a joke.
[12650.78s -> 12652.18s]  Yeah. All right. So let's put it down here.
[12653.70s -> 12657.49s]  What is this? What game is that?
[12657.49s -> 12658.97s]  I can't I can't tell. What is that?
[12661.90s -> 12667.32s]  What is it? Is it Monster Hunter?
[12670.32s -> 12674.98s]  I don't think Monster Hunter is kind of hard, but it's I thought it was fine.
[12675.18s -> 12676.30s]  This was some annoyance.
[12680.19s -> 12684.03s]  Is this I can't tell what that is.
[12687.03s -> 12688.31s]  Oh, it's a different Monster Hunter.
[12688.31s -> 12689.31s]  OK, well, I haven't played it.
[12689.31s -> 12690.19s]  What's this one?
[12695.69s -> 12697.17s]  I don't think I've ever played this one either.
[12699.02s -> 12701.19s]  That's what is it?
[12701.39s -> 12702.71s]  Mushi.
[12703.54s -> 12704.62s]  Oh, I haven't played it.
[12705.12s -> 12709.16s]  Salt and Sanctuary was was hard, but that wasn't that bad.
[12709.16s -> 12710.28s]  It was some annoyance there.
[12713.02s -> 12714.74s]  I don't I don't think I played this either.
[12718.13s -> 12719.13s]  I don't know what that is.
[12721.17s -> 12722.01s]  What is this one?
[12722.45s -> 12724.65s]  Oh, there's all these Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter 2.
[12724.85s -> 12727.66s]  No War Fortress never played it.
[12729.26s -> 12730.42s]  Spelunky.
[12730.62s -> 12732.58s]  I just like I didn't really like it.
[12733.08s -> 12733.96s]  I wasn't into it.
[12735.83s -> 12736.87s]  I'm going to should I put it?
[12736.87s -> 12737.47s]  It can't beat it.
[12737.47s -> 12738.99s]  But I played it, but I just didn't like it.
[12739.19s -> 12740.67s]  So I'm going to put that down here.
[12742.26s -> 12743.18s]  Battle.
[12744.71s -> 12745.71s]  Yeah, Riga.
[12746.22s -> 12747.34s]  I don't know what that is.
[12747.54s -> 12748.34s]  Overwhelm.
[12748.54s -> 12749.94s]  I don't know what that is.
[12750.14s -> 12753.92s]  Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden Black.
[12753.92s -> 12754.84s]  I don't think I've ever played this.
[12757.78s -> 12758.66s]  I never played this one.
[12759.35s -> 12763.50s]  Finding of Isaac is it depends on your run, I think.
[12764.84s -> 12766.64s]  Oh, everyone's OK.
[12766.84s -> 12768.92s]  I was completely ignoring everybody saying
[12769.12s -> 12773.04s]  Deltarune because I was I thought you said it was you were saying it was on this list.
[12773.57s -> 12775.21s]  I was like, they just say it's not on this list.
[12775.21s -> 12776.45s]  Why are they saying it's a hard game?
[12778.36s -> 12780.36s]  It's like people like Deltarune, Deltarune, Deltarune.
[12780.36s -> 12781.28s]  It's like it's not even on here.
[12781.28s -> 12782.32s]  Why are people saying that?
[12782.52s -> 12784.68s]  And then I realized what was going on.
[12803.10s -> 12804.78s]  I have not played FTL.
[12805.74s -> 12807.34s]  I've not played Into the Breach.
[12807.54s -> 12808.82s]  I've not played Battletech.
[12809.02s -> 12809.78s]  I have not.
[12809.98s -> 12813.22s]  I played Enter the Gungeon for a little bit, but I didn't really play it.
[12813.22s -> 12815.02s]  I didn't really really care too much.
[12815.02s -> 12815.82s]  Hotline Miami.
[12815.82s -> 12818.06s]  This game is fucking unbelievably unbearable,
[12818.26s -> 12819.82s]  although the second one is way worse.
[12820.02s -> 12821.38s]  This one is still up here.
[12822.26s -> 12827.60s]  The Witness is that I didn't play.
[12827.68s -> 12829.72s]  That's just like the line puzzle game, right?
[12832.02s -> 12834.60s]  I didn't play it.
[12834.80s -> 12839.04s]  Mario the Lost Levels are they're pretty bad, but not really.
[12839.24s -> 12844.64s]  Hades was challenging, but it was still like doable.
[12844.84s -> 12848.93s]  Hades is probably now Cuphead's probably more annoying.
[12850.46s -> 12853.10s]  Bloodborne is up here too, but I don't think it was.
[12853.30s -> 12859.18s]  I wouldn't say Bloodborne is it's up there pretty high.
[12859.38s -> 12860.98s]  Some of those bosses were horrible.
[12861.18s -> 12863.38s]  This is literally an uncompletable video game.
[12863.58s -> 12866.90s]  You cannot beat this without cheats.
[12867.14s -> 12872.38s]  It's it's not possible to beat this without like a game genie.
[12873.22s -> 12874.14s]  Louder.
[12874.65s -> 12877.04s]  I'll give you 10 percent louder.
[12877.24s -> 12879.22s]  What else we got?
[12879.42s -> 12881.02s]  Stuntman. Why is this on here?
[12881.22s -> 12883.22s]  Did you make this list specifically for me?
[12886.60s -> 12889.92s]  If this wait, why Stuntman Ignition on here?
[12894.65s -> 12898.69s]  I was like pissed at this game, but this is not considered a hard game.
[12898.89s -> 12904.29s]  Is it? Is it?
[12904.49s -> 12908.58s]  I don't know. What an egomaniac.
[12908.78s -> 12909.82s]  All right.
[12910.02s -> 12910.98s]  What is this?
[12911.14s -> 12913.02s]  Drifter or played it.
[12913.39s -> 12914.99s]  I think Celeste was balanced.
[12918.63s -> 12920.75s]  I don't think I got too annoyed with Celeste.
[12920.95s -> 12924.07s]  Noida, on the other hand, I could I just can't fucking do it.
[12924.27s -> 12925.83s]  I cannot fucking do it.
[12926.66s -> 12929.54s]  Super Meat Boy was bad, but it was possible.
[12929.74s -> 12931.62s]  I don't think it was that high up, though.
[12933.08s -> 12936.20s]  Original Castlevania was annoying.
[12936.40s -> 12939.36s]  But like, I'm not going to who's going to play that right now?
[12941.46s -> 12944.34s]  Like, it's like, oh, OK, like Castlevania, the original one.
[12944.54s -> 12947.29s]  Like, yeah, it's I was hard back then.
[12947.29s -> 12950.73s]  But I can compare to like Jump King.
[12950.93s -> 12952.65s]  It's like kind of two different.
[12954.50s -> 12956.22s]  I don't know what this is. I didn't play it.
[12957.04s -> 12958.72s]  The original Dark Souls.
[12962.94s -> 12964.94s]  What's harder, Bloodborne or Dark Souls?
[12965.14s -> 12966.82s]  I feel like they're hard for different reasons.
[12970.58s -> 12972.62s]  The original Dark Souls is probably more annoying.
[12973.96s -> 12980.39s]  Yeah, Super Meat Boy is not really hard.
[12980.39s -> 12981.71s]  It just takes memorization.
[12981.91s -> 12984.65s]  You just have to memorize levels,
[12984.85s -> 12987.97s]  which you could say the same thing about Dark Souls bosses, but not really.
[12988.17s -> 12991.61s]  Because Dark Souls bosses, unlike Super Meat Boy,
[12992.01s -> 12994.57s]  they have a range of attacks that they will do,
[12994.77s -> 12997.81s]  but you don't know which attack they're going to do.
[12998.01s -> 13001.89s]  In Super Meat Boy, you know the levels are just the same.
[13001.89s -> 13003.61s]  You just have to memorize the level.
[13005.01s -> 13012.58s]  So these are probably that's probably a good spot.
[13012.78s -> 13014.30s]  Isaac,
[13015.25s -> 13020.81s]  Isaac can be really annoying sometimes, but Demon's Souls was probably harder
[13021.01s -> 13031.14s]  than just like the world tendency shit made this game so fucking hard sometimes.
[13031.34s -> 13032.54s]  Hard or frustrating?
[13040.23s -> 13041.55s]  I feel like the first few worlds,
[13041.55s -> 13044.31s]  like the first two or three worlds in Demon's Souls were not that hard.
[13049.74s -> 13050.66s]  That's still annoying.
[13053.02s -> 13057.46s]  Desert bus doesn't I mean, why even there's no reason to do that.
[13057.66s -> 13059.62s]  I have not played any of the Devil May Cry games.
[13059.82s -> 13063.48s]  I I got through some of Hollow Knight on stream,
[13063.92s -> 13065.88s]  but people are mad that I never went back to it.
[13066.08s -> 13067.28s]  But just that's the way it is.
[13067.48s -> 13069.04s]  Surge.
[13075.37s -> 13078.82s]  We have a lot of new viewers.
[13080.66s -> 13083.38s]  I was I said a lot of mean things about the surge.
[13085.19s -> 13086.03s]  Do you know those?
[13086.23s -> 13090.11s]  I was streaming the surge to like 600 viewers or something like it was.
[13090.11s -> 13092.71s]  I had like 500 viewers at the time, but like less than a thousand at the time.
[13092.91s -> 13093.31s]  Right.
[13093.88s -> 13097.24s]  That was very beginning of my like Twitch life.
[13098.00s -> 13099.04s]  Holy fuck.
[13099.24s -> 13100.52s]  I hated that whole thing.
[13101.09s -> 13104.01s]  I was infuriated by that whole experience.
[13105.98s -> 13109.42s]  You said it was literally the worst video game ever made.
[13114.79s -> 13115.39s]  It's a good game.
[13115.59s -> 13117.63s]  You're just a literal baby.
[13124.73s -> 13127.51s]  Does anybody have like a clip from that stream?
[13128.53s -> 13130.69s]  Any of you guys, some of you like lore masters
[13130.69s -> 13138.82s]  that have like a like a saved clip of me being like a psycho on that stream?
[13139.02s -> 13139.86s]  Somebody does.
[13144.40s -> 13148.97s]  OK, well, I'm just going to I'm going to put it down here because I played it
[13149.17s -> 13150.65s]  for like maybe an hour and a half.
[13154.42s -> 13156.34s]  Just watch the VOD.
[13156.54s -> 13157.46s]  OK, hold on.
[13162.25s -> 13163.41s]  I'm going to let's see.
[13166.98s -> 13167.78s]  Let's get it.
[13169.44s -> 13170.96s]  It's definitely on the archive.
[13172.68s -> 13173.84s]  The surge.
[13177.61s -> 13180.01s]  Yeah. OK, this is from like five years ago.
[13180.45s -> 13181.61s]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[13181.81s -> 13186.02s]  OK, you guys ready to see what my thought?
[13186.10s -> 13187.90s]  Where should I put the surge on this tier list?
[13193.36s -> 13194.84s]  We're going to skip through when I'm going to watch the whole thing.
[13201.68s -> 13206.34s]  Hey, how long did I scream this for?
[13209.15s -> 13217.61s]  I wonder. We'll find out.
[13219.39s -> 13220.75s]  So this is the surge.
[13223.30s -> 13225.22s]  An hour and 55 minutes.
[13225.42s -> 13226.22s]  Holy shit.
[13227.50s -> 13231.02s]  And the first 10 to 20 minutes is absolutely me like introduction.
[13231.22s -> 13234.26s]  And the last probably 40 minutes is doing the old bit readings, right?
[13234.46s -> 13246.23s]  I played this for probably an hour.
[13246.43s -> 13248.15s]  How excited do I sound, you think?
[13248.35s -> 13253.73s]  Who, who, who fucking who cry, crying.
[13253.93s -> 13256.89s]  I'm tears are streaming down my face, angry.
[13259.12s -> 13259.84s]  Yeah.
[13267.42s -> 13269.30s]  Oh, wait, this is one of those plant, the trees.
[13269.50s -> 13270.14s]  What is what it's going?
[13270.34s -> 13273.73s]  What does that make that clicking sound?
[13281.91s -> 13283.39s]  Isn't when they turned me into Darth Vader.
[13283.39s -> 13284.75s]  I was just going to say that in this part.
[13284.95s -> 13288.11s]  I was just going to say that I was just going to say that
[13288.31s -> 13299.98s]  is where I practice punching things.
[13299.98s -> 13300.58s]  Right.
[13301.46s -> 13302.18s]  All right, here we go.
[13302.38s -> 13307.25s]  How much do I hate it?
[13307.45s -> 13309.21s]  Press circle to heal.
[13309.41s -> 13311.05s]  Use your vital injection.
[13312.19s -> 13313.43s]  That's that's quick.
[13313.63s -> 13314.71s]  Our three is lock on.
[13314.91s -> 13315.71s]  Sure.
[13315.91s -> 13316.87s]  Our one is horizontal.
[13317.07s -> 13318.51s]  Our two is vertical.
[13319.36s -> 13323.22s]  OK, they can be going to be strung together.
[13323.42s -> 13323.98s]  OK.
[13324.18s -> 13324.98s]  Yeah.
[13326.12s -> 13329.20s]  Whoever made this game, fuck you.
[13334.58s -> 13335.38s]  Shit.
[13339.54s -> 13343.44s]  Um, I don't actually I don't actually mean that, by the way.
[13343.44s -> 13345.36s]  I was just like frustrated at the game.
[13350.98s -> 13351.62s]  Who made this game?
[13351.82s -> 13353.26s]  Fuck you. Dark Souls is way better.
[13353.46s -> 13355.22s]  Oh, my God, I'm such a dick.
[13355.42s -> 13356.54s]  What the hell?
[13356.74s -> 13358.10s]  What's wrong?
[13358.30s -> 13362.34s]  No, I'm this is not who I am.
[13362.66s -> 13370.10s]  Yeah, delete this, delete this from deleted.
[13374.51s -> 13376.03s]  Is he writing this right now?
[13376.41s -> 13379.25s]  Rhonic in a game like fucking stuff.
[13382.57s -> 13384.29s]  Why is there time based retrieval?
[13384.49s -> 13390.98s]  That's fucking moronic in a game like this.
[13391.18s -> 13392.22s]  All right.
[13395.10s -> 13397.62s]  I'm not throwing in the towel yet.
[13398.38s -> 13399.38s]  Not yet. Not yet.
[13399.58s -> 13408.35s]  Not yet. Toxic.
[13408.55s -> 13409.51s]  How much does this block?
[13409.71s -> 13414.54s]  OK, I gotta be very, very real with everybody here.
[13414.74s -> 13418.71s]  So this been a lot of times I've played a game
[13418.83s -> 13423.87s]  and on stream, I never I never want to like just like talk shit about like a game
[13423.87s -> 13425.11s]  company because you don't know. Right.
[13425.31s -> 13430.99s]  Like it just the game might not be for you or like maybe it's like it's better
[13431.19s -> 13434.39s]  later or maybe you just like have to learn if it's like it's a learning curve.
[13434.83s -> 13440.06s]  I always hate like talking shit on stream because like I
[13440.26s -> 13445.43s]  would I try to condense my rage to not get that far.
[13445.43s -> 13448.79s]  So when you hear me do that, when you ever hear me do that on this
[13448.87s -> 13456.30s]  broadcast, I it's I've been holding it in and I just have to fucking say something.
[13457.51s -> 13459.39s]  I've hit the boiling point at that point.
[13460.28s -> 13463.00s]  And sometimes it happens really quickly and sometimes it happens over an hour.
[13463.70s -> 13466.82s]  But I always try to like bottle it because I don't want to like obviously be
[13466.82s -> 13470.14s]  like a dick or anything, but like, holy shit, listen to this guy.
[13476.27s -> 13478.71s]  Stream looks like ass, too, by the way.
[13479.15s -> 13483.23s]  They stream it like 480p, but four years ago, five years ago.
[13487.83s -> 13489.59s]  Was it 720? It was probably 720.
[13489.59s -> 13492.69s]  While you can.
[13492.89s -> 13496.87s]  No, it's probably a low bit rate, though.
[13499.10s -> 13503.90s]  My bit rate that I'm doing is probably doubled since like 2015, 2016.
[13509.27s -> 13510.11s]  All right.
[13511.00s -> 13513.16s]  And wait, this guy might kill me.
[13514.18s -> 13515.10s]  Oh, I got hit.
[13515.30s -> 13516.70s]  Immediate anger.
[13517.90s -> 13518.58s]  Oh, I got hit.
[13518.58s -> 13520.26s]  Apparently, I didn't have invincibility.
[13520.46s -> 13523.18s]  Apparently, apparently, apparently.
[13523.38s -> 13525.34s]  And he's going to go, OK.
[13527.32s -> 13529.84s]  See, apparently means it's not my fault
[13529.84s -> 13532.40s]  that I got hit because, like, apparently you get hit if you do that.
[13532.40s -> 13534.52s]  Like, I'm it's not my fault, right?
[13541.04s -> 13542.04s]  It's this clip here.
[13542.04s -> 13544.84s]  Well, I mean, where is that in the time stamp of the stream?
[13546.82s -> 13548.58s]  I need a new weapon or something.
[13548.78s -> 13552.94s]  I'm literally in the stream right now.
[13553.14s -> 13554.34s]  No.
[13556.53s -> 13558.13s]  Oh, awful.
[13560.69s -> 13565.37s]  This game is fucking terrible, like a zero out of fucking 10.
[13565.57s -> 13567.45s]  It's awful.
[13568.22s -> 13569.42s]  Don't fucking buy this game.
[13569.62s -> 13571.06s]  Oh, my God. Dark Souls game.
[13571.26s -> 13574.50s]  Go play Dark Souls. This game sucks asshole.
[13574.70s -> 13576.90s]  I can't. This is awful.
[13577.34s -> 13580.06s]  This is awful. I would rather use like I would rather you.
[13580.26s -> 13583.30s]  No, I'm not going to say it because that's like lewd and fucked up.
[13583.50s -> 13584.50s]  What?
[13585.32s -> 13588.44s]  I was about to say something like fucked up right there.
[13588.64s -> 13595.48s]  So glad I didn't watch the rest of it.
[13600.27s -> 13601.63s]  I'm say it. Say it.
[13601.83s -> 13603.63s]  What am I? Don't say it. I don't know what he's going to say.
[13603.83s -> 13605.67s]  This game is just fucking bad.
[13610.66s -> 13612.18s]  How did this game get an eight?
[13613.19s -> 13614.23s]  Who gave this game an eight?
[13614.43s -> 13615.79s]  No, don't. Don't.
[13615.99s -> 13618.11s]  This is a fucking six game at best.
[13618.31s -> 13619.99s]  Maybe a five.
[13622.99s -> 13624.39s]  It's probably fine.
[13624.39s -> 13627.71s]  I'm just such a fucking over dramatic asshole.
[13630.84s -> 13634.28s]  I can't. What the fuck is even happening with this guy?
[13639.84s -> 13641.32s]  Oh, I don't know.
[13641.52s -> 13644.48s]  I was like, no, I'm speechless.
[13644.68s -> 13646.28s]  I'm just speechless.
[13648.06s -> 13649.50s]  We want all German.
[13649.70s -> 13656.66s]  No, I literally said fuck Capcom like six weeks ago.
[13656.66s -> 13657.82s]  What are you talking about?
[13658.46s -> 13659.90s]  He never left.
[13674.42s -> 13676.38s]  It's under it's try harder.
[13676.58s -> 13678.58s]  Oh, I'm almost there.
[13678.74s -> 13680.25s]  Somehow.
[13680.45s -> 13681.77s]  No, I don't want to hear it.
[13681.77s -> 13682.69s]  Two health bars.
[13682.69s -> 13684.29s]  First game of two thousand.
[13684.29s -> 13685.45s]  I don't want to hear it.
[13686.02s -> 13687.18s]  What if I don't want to hear it, though?
[13687.38s -> 13688.38s]  I don't want to hear it.
[13688.82s -> 13689.90s]  I fucking hate this game.
[13690.10s -> 13691.70s]  I hate this game.
[13692.39s -> 13695.91s]  I think that honestly, this is the first game of 2017 that I fucking despise.
[13696.11s -> 13699.30s]  I hate this game.
[13699.94s -> 13702.94s]  I fucking hate this game.
[13703.14s -> 13704.94s]  This must have been so miserable to watch live.
[13705.14s -> 13708.18s]  This is the first game of 2017 that I fucking hate.
[13708.38s -> 13709.70s]  Oh, listen to that. Fuck.
[13710.08s -> 13711.84s]  That's not like, oh, I fucking hate this.
[13711.96s -> 13713.44s]  That's I fucking.
[13713.64s -> 13715.08s]  I fucking hate this.
[13715.28s -> 13716.04s]  Wow.
[13717.89s -> 13719.45s]  If you want to add a list, make a list.
[13719.65s -> 13720.77s]  This is the first one.
[13727.99s -> 13729.47s]  No, I didn't.
[13729.67s -> 13733.35s]  Outlast 2 was like I wasn't a wasn't a huge fan of it, but it was, you know,
[13733.55s -> 13734.83s]  it was it was all right. I didn't mind it.
[13735.03s -> 13736.15s]  It was OK.
[13737.49s -> 13739.45s]  Outlast 2 was like,
[13739.65s -> 13742.81s]  it wasn't really like it was didn't feel like I said a lot of swears and stuff.
[13743.01s -> 13744.73s]  But, you know, what?
[13744.93s -> 13746.73s]  What are you talking about?
[13746.93s -> 13747.89s]  What are you talking about?
[13748.09s -> 13749.29s]  I hate this game.
[13753.86s -> 13756.58s]  I didn't say any squares funny in some places.
[13756.78s -> 13757.82s]  It was like fun.
[13758.84s -> 13761.12s]  Well, I don't think it was as good as the first game, but I didn't.
[13761.32s -> 13762.84s]  Like I enjoyed it.
[13763.04s -> 13766.48s]  OK, so when I say this thing, I give it like a stamp of recommended.
[13766.68s -> 13768.72s]  If you like those games, right?
[13770.95s -> 13772.91s]  But for me, for me, for at least this year,
[13773.11s -> 13776.07s]  this is the first true game sucks like for me.
[13776.77s -> 13778.57s]  This was the first year that I watched the screen.
[13778.77s -> 13780.73s]  You are more than welcome to enjoy this game.
[13780.93s -> 13782.29s]  It's one fifty three.
[13782.29s -> 13783.41s]  You bought it. I hope you love it.
[13783.98s -> 13785.54s]  Real boss. That was the asylum demon.
[13785.74s -> 13786.82s]  What? Oh, my God.
[13786.82s -> 13788.50s]  It's just this is like 30 straight minutes.
[13788.70s -> 13790.54s]  Thank you for the hundred dollars.
[13790.74s -> 13792.10s]  Thank you.
[13792.30s -> 13794.06s]  Thanks for the hundred dollars.
[13794.06s -> 13796.58s]  Like, what the hell? What is going on in this video?
[13800.60s -> 13803.12s]  Where is it? One fifty three lift in the boss room stops.
[13803.32s -> 13805.28s]  Channel switched microphone.
[13805.48s -> 13808.37s]  Hey, you here?
[13808.57s -> 13810.49s]  Am I talking to I am here?
[13810.69s -> 13812.97s]  OK, I was told that you needed saving.
[13813.17s -> 13815.69s]  This is the worst game I've ever played.
[13815.89s -> 13819.69s]  Really is that the first one you turn you up first to Alex.
[13819.89s -> 13822.13s]  This is the worst game I've ever played.
[13822.69s -> 13824.33s]  You sound very quiet to me.
[13824.53s -> 13826.01s]  I'm very quiet.
[13826.21s -> 13828.29s]  Yeah. Hold on, turn me up.
[13828.49s -> 13832.73s]  I am what I want to go like rant to six decibels.
[13832.93s -> 13835.13s]  Well, did I like call one of my friends
[13835.13s -> 13837.61s]  to like I was so upset that I had to like rant at him?
[13838.18s -> 13840.02s]  Why? Why would I want to stream this?
[13840.22s -> 13841.22s]  No, I got to turn again.
[13841.42s -> 13842.54s]  I got to turn you down.
[13842.98s -> 13844.62s]  Oh, I'm a loud boy.
[13845.57s -> 13848.41s]  I turned him way too far down.
[13849.94s -> 13851.62s]  You shouldn't. Why are people saying there's an echo?
[13851.82s -> 13853.86s]  I'm going to mute my mic.
[13855.54s -> 13856.98s]  When does this quote happen?
[13857.18s -> 13858.42s]  Friday the 14th.
[13860.46s -> 13863.02s]  Where's this quote? You guys you're linking me wrong stuff.
[13863.22s -> 13872.57s]  One forty three.
[13882.16s -> 13884.44s]  Down on your fucking hands.
[13885.52s -> 13887.72s]  One forty four.
[13887.92s -> 13889.92s]  You guys, you guys are saying random numbers.
[13890.12s -> 13891.08s]  What?
[13892.22s -> 13894.10s]  I'm done. I'm done playing.
[13897.55s -> 13899.31s]  This is a fun game. Italics, where are you?
[13903.08s -> 13905.41s]  Italics, where are you? Are you here?
[13914.23s -> 13916.39s]  I tried to warn you. I played for an hour and refunded.
[13916.43s -> 13919.16s]  Italics, where are you?
[13919.36s -> 13922.53s]  You made the surge on stream.
[13922.73s -> 13924.53s]  Just watch the clip.
[13928.04s -> 13929.72s]  Why are you referencing Bible verses?
[13929.72s -> 13931.12s]  What are you talking about?
[13931.32s -> 13933.24s]  Fuck this game. I don't even care if I won.
[13933.24s -> 13934.44s]  And I feel like good about winning.
[13934.44s -> 13935.20s]  No, I don't. I don't.
[13935.20s -> 13936.24s]  It was like the tutorial boss.
[13936.24s -> 13937.36s]  That was the asylum demon.
[13937.56s -> 13939.08s]  Why? I don't care.
[13940.22s -> 13941.10s]  This game doesn't suck.
[13941.10s -> 13942.26s]  I'm sorry for saying that.
[13942.26s -> 13944.58s]  If you're like a developer and you're watching this game,
[13946.75s -> 13949.15s]  try fucking harder next time.
[13953.94s -> 13957.86s]  Oh, my God.
[13958.02s -> 13960.82s]  Oh, my God.
[13965.36s -> 13972.08s]  OK, so I'm going to say that it should probably
[13972.28s -> 13979.67s]  on the on the tier list, the surge should probably be on a game that I couldn't beat.
[13979.87s -> 13983.82s]  I can't beat.
[13986.06s -> 13987.14s]  Whoo.
[13993.91s -> 13997.67s]  OK, you know, like, you know, OK, like
[14009.63s -> 14010.79s]  I have to get out of here.
[14010.99s -> 14011.75s]  I have to get out of here.
[14011.95s -> 14013.11s]  I'm not allowed on here.
[14014.00s -> 14016.16s]  All right. Oh, this is F zero.
[14016.36s -> 14017.76s]  I never played F zero.
[14019.76s -> 14020.72s]  Oh, I did.
[14020.92s -> 14023.84s]  I hated Neo as well, didn't I?
[14025.43s -> 14030.85s]  I didn't I talk a bunch of shit about this game too?
[14031.05s -> 14033.98s]  No,
[14034.18s -> 14035.34s]  I did.
[14035.54s -> 14037.70s]  I remember being like this fucking game, like fucking sucks.
[14037.90s -> 14040.02s]  No, no, I couldn't do it.
[14047.44s -> 14050.44s]  No, to be fair, I was like shit faced when I played this game, wasn't I?
[14050.94s -> 14058.45s]  No, no, we're moving on.
[14060.62s -> 14065.81s]  What is this one?
[14066.01s -> 14069.09s]  I remember people saying, hey, you should go play Neo 2.
[14070.74s -> 14072.70s]  I don't think so.
[14074.00s -> 14076.16s]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[14079.10s -> 14080.94s]  No, I've not seen it.
[14081.38s -> 14082.50s]  No, I've not seen it.
[14082.58s -> 14083.50s]  I'm not looking at it.
[14087.20s -> 14088.48s]  I'm going to go pee. I'm peeing.
[14088.68s -> 14089.80s]  I'm not even here. I'm leaving.
[14095.68s -> 14269.02s]  I got to pee.
[14284.14s -> 14286.62s]  Yeah, but I've heard me say it.
[14286.82s -> 14288.86s]  You can cut that shit. No, don't.
[14289.06s -> 14290.26s]  You don't have to.
[14291.34s -> 14294.15s]  You don't have to.
[14294.35s -> 14295.39s]  You don't have to.
[14295.59s -> 14298.94s]  I'm certain of it.
[14301.80s -> 14303.24s]  I don't know.
[14308.54s -> 14311.98s]  OK, 2017 in Germany was mean.
[14319.14s -> 14320.58s]  I don't think so.
[14320.78s -> 14322.42s]  Have I gotten less mean?
[14322.62s -> 14324.38s]  Was I mean? Maybe I was.
[14324.58s -> 14325.58s]  No, I wasn't.
[14329.61s -> 14331.25s]  I well.
[14332.20s -> 14335.85s]  All right, let's finish this.
[14336.22s -> 14337.98s]  And then I'm going to move on from Tierless.
[14337.98s -> 14339.46s]  I want to play a couple of these little games.
[14345.18s -> 14349.66s]  I want to I want to play some of these little like browser games.
[14352.78s -> 14354.30s]  That's not supposed to still be on.
[14357.75s -> 14360.95s]  Oh, but the Deltarune soundtrack back on, please.
[14361.15s -> 14375.58s]  Yep.
[14382.74s -> 14386.34s]  Toby Fox is the Mozart of fucking like this generation.
[14388.18s -> 14389.46s]  All right.
[14393.42s -> 14401.50s]  Over here. All right.
[14403.54s -> 14405.90s]  Deltarune OST is on again.
[14407.82s -> 14410.74s]  Odd hand, I know people really want me to play this, but I just didn't.
[14410.94s -> 14414.82s]  I kept. No, don't put me another one.
[14426.26s -> 14427.22s]  I did it again.
[14428.56s -> 14432.40s]  I talk about how much this game sucks and how it's fucking terrible.
[14445.51s -> 14447.91s]  Is this is it in this clip?
[14461.60s -> 14465.24s]  I just think I'm when I play hard games, I just get really, really mad.
[14466.45s -> 14467.73s]  I just get things just piss me off.
[14468.68s -> 14470.76s]  I don't know why. Like, I just get so infuriated.
[14475.23s -> 14477.27s]  Requested this game a million times.
[14477.47s -> 14478.71s]  Are you here?
[14478.91s -> 14485.55s]  The only reason why I'm doing a fighting game in the arcade.
[14488.21s -> 14489.25s]  Stinger.
[14489.45s -> 14490.85s]  What is it? What is that?
[14491.05s -> 14492.53s]  What button is that supposed to be?
[14494.25s -> 14495.65s]  Pretty good DDT.
[14496.28s -> 14500.29s]  He's not here.
[14504.30s -> 14505.26s]  He's not even here.
[14505.46s -> 14509.82s]  He's going to shit his pants when he realizes he missed this stream.
[14510.02s -> 14512.06s]  But I hope the guy is here.
[14512.26s -> 14514.78s]  That is requested this game a million times.
[14522.84s -> 14527.20s]  There's not any more clips of me talking about how like, oh, yeah, there is.
[14527.40s -> 14530.52s]  These are every game on this list.
[14530.68s -> 14532.16s]  Don't you understand, guys?
[14532.60s -> 14537.04s]  Every single game on this list, there is a whole vod of me talking about how much
[14537.24s -> 14539.96s]  the game is a piece of shit and how I fucking hate it.
[14540.16s -> 14541.96s]  And it's like the worst game I've ever played.
[14542.66s -> 14544.18s]  Everyone on this list.
[14553.32s -> 14556.68s]  That was really high, though.
[14558.98s -> 14559.98s]  I didn't beat this one.
[14561.31s -> 14563.11s]  I did not beat getting over it.
[14566.69s -> 14568.53s]  Show the hit and run meltdown clip.
[14568.73s -> 14570.65s]  It's the whole broadcast.
[14571.60s -> 14573.80s]  It's the entire broadcast.
[14574.00s -> 14576.60s]  It's like that was like a 12 hour stream.
[14577.19s -> 14579.15s]  After the first 45 minutes, it's all it was.
[14579.35s -> 14581.27s]  I probably, you know, that stream,
[14581.71s -> 14586.03s]  Simpsons Hit and Run, that one day of streaming Simpsons Hit and Run,
[14586.23s -> 14591.03s]  I believe was the equivalent of me smoking five to six thousand packs of cigarettes.
[14591.23s -> 14593.19s]  That's like the amount of damage it did to my life.
[14593.39s -> 14595.07s]  That's the amount of damage it did to my brain.
[14601.98s -> 14605.66s]  Like, if I went to get like a chest x-ray, they'd be like, what happened?
[14605.86s -> 14607.10s]  Do you smoke?
[14607.47s -> 14608.87s]  Do you smoke cigarettes?
[14608.87s -> 14610.75s]  It looks like you've been a smoker for a long time.
[14611.13s -> 14613.37s]  I'd be like, no, I haven't smoked ever in my whole life.
[14614.41s -> 14616.96s]  Oh, well, what happened then?
[14617.16s -> 14621.75s]  Well, you know, a few of these fucking games that are hard games like Simpsons
[14621.95s -> 14628.29s]  Hit and Run, like I would have damage that you could see on like an x-ray.
[14632.63s -> 14637.42s]  Anyways, I didn't play this.
[14637.62s -> 14647.77s]  Oh, there's a clip in that one, too,
[14647.97s -> 14650.49s]  when I talk about how stupid the devs are.
[14651.38s -> 14654.18s]  Oh, this is like a horrible epiphany I'm having.
[14654.38s -> 14658.66s]  This is like I'm being I'm being shown all of my demons at once.
[14659.54s -> 14661.46s]  He's sweating. Yeah, it's fucking hot.
[14664.91s -> 14666.67s]  Yeah, there's a part where I'm in the steam room and I'm like,
[14666.87s -> 14669.71s]  this is the worst game I've ever played, like all the devs are fucking morons.
[14673.93s -> 14683.11s]  Like I am being shown all of my bullshit right now.
[14683.31s -> 14686.11s]  I mean, Hotline Miami 2 was so unbearable.
[14686.55s -> 14687.79s]  I would put it here.
[14687.99s -> 14689.15s]  But at least I beat it.
[14690.74s -> 14692.42s]  Was that worse than Hit Simpsons?
[14692.62s -> 14699.50s]  Probably not.
[14699.70s -> 14703.34s]  I haven't played Ghouls and Ghosts.
[14703.54s -> 14704.82s]  My summer car.
[14706.02s -> 14709.78s]  I mean, I played it, but I thought it wasn't like hard or anything, was it?
[14711.70s -> 14716.26s]  Don't Starve didn't really play it, didn't play Boshi, didn't play Spelunky.
[14716.30s -> 14717.98s]  I'm just going to pick up things that I played.
[14718.18s -> 14719.98s]  This game was annoying, but at least I beat it.
[14722.14s -> 14724.02s]  Play Dead Cells.
[14724.22s -> 14726.10s]  All Mario. Oh, no, don't say that.
[14736.08s -> 14740.12s]  I was going to say that all Mario carts.
[14741.33s -> 14747.38s]  No, no, I'm this is 2021 not toxic.
[14747.58s -> 14748.82s]  I am not toxic.
[14748.82s -> 14753.12s]  I am going to give everybody the benefit of the doubt and I'm not going to say
[14753.32s -> 14760.83s]  anything and I was going to tell you that after the let's say since they OK,
[14761.87s -> 14765.15s]  since Nintendo started coming up with consoles that you shook around a controller,
[14765.72s -> 14769.61s]  they've been awful. Don't hurt me, please don't hurt me.
[14792.32s -> 14805.98s]  OK, your Thanksgiving tier list was awful, but this is a redemption.
[14807.89s -> 14813.63s]  Dark Souls 2 is it's kind of I don't know if it was harder than all these,
[14813.83s -> 14821.86s]  but it was it was a lot of stuff going on and I wasn't a big fan of Dark Souls 2.
[14822.82s -> 14826.94s]  Darkest Dungeon was really annoying, but it was still doable.
[14827.63s -> 14828.67s]  Although now I never beat it.
[14828.83s -> 14830.43s]  I actually did not beat the Darkest Dungeon.
[14830.43s -> 14834.91s]  I did not. I didn't play this.
[14834.91s -> 14836.91s]  We play this and played and played and played and not played.
[14837.11s -> 14842.22s]  Not not not not not not not not.
[14842.91s -> 14844.71s]  No,
[14856.61s -> 14857.57s]  no comment.
[14858.33s -> 14859.53s]  Oh,
[14865.98s -> 14867.22s]  hmm.
[14868.82s -> 14871.02s]  Dark Souls 3 is up here somewhere.
[14872.74s -> 14874.26s]  Oh, boy, this one was bad.
[14875.14s -> 14877.14s]  Did I beat I beat Lifeline, though I beat it.
[14881.68s -> 14883.04s]  Punch out.
[14885.14s -> 14886.70s]  Mario Tennis Aces.
[14894.24s -> 14895.40s]  I'm going to want to link the clip where
[14895.40s -> 14899.48s]  I talk about what I'm talking shit to the kid like I'm making fun of a fake child.
[14900.44s -> 14902.92s]  Damn, I really was fucked up.
[14904.32s -> 14905.00s]  Holy shit.
[14905.20s -> 14910.88s]  I'm like, look at these are all these things were from like 2016 to like 2018,
[14911.38s -> 14916.42s]  like 2019, I was mean and rude to people.
[14916.62s -> 14918.30s]  I still am. Well, am I?
[14918.50s -> 14920.92s]  No, I'm not.
[14921.12s -> 14921.88s]  This is the one, right?
[14926.03s -> 14927.91s]  No, I know. I'm fine.
[14928.11s -> 14928.71s]  Fine.
[14934.91s -> 14936.67s]  But I hope the guy is here.
[14940.63s -> 14942.03s]  This is the clip. I think it is.
[14948.94s -> 14950.58s]  Good job, Nicholas.
[14950.78s -> 14953.18s]  Good luck in the first grade next week.
[14955.15s -> 14956.55s]  Damn it, man.
[14958.68s -> 14960.12s]  Now, this is not the clip.
[14960.69s -> 14962.81s]  This is not the right. I mean, that's mean.
[14963.44s -> 14964.68s]  Good job, Nicholas.
[14964.88s -> 14967.04s]  I mean, that was kind of rude, but I
[14969.53s -> 14973.61s]  it was like I said a lot more awful things, I think, on this one.
[14980.32s -> 14982.40s]  You got destroyed by a first grader.
[14984.57s -> 14985.41s]  All right. I'm playing it.
[14985.61s -> 14987.89s]  I'm done with Tierless. I'm done with Tierless.
[14988.09s -> 14989.25s]  It's too I don't like this.
[14989.45s -> 14991.78s]  I'm done. Portal 2 was a lot of fun.
[14991.98s -> 14994.58s]  It was balanced.
[14996.71s -> 14998.43s]  Which Ninja Turtles game is this?
[14998.63s -> 15000.55s]  Because they were they were always really fun, balanced.
[15002.06s -> 15003.18s]  Buster Truck never played it.
[15003.38s -> 15007.30s]  Chilly Time is actually uncompletable, so that's fine.
[15010.62s -> 15011.26s]  There you go.
[15012.14s -> 15015.04s]  Now we're going to play
[15015.24s -> 15016.92s]  a little browser game.
[15018.19s -> 15021.10s]  There's a couple here.
[15021.30s -> 15025.11s]  Let's do this one, but find the U.S.
[15025.31s -> 15026.95s]  States with no outline.
[15026.95s -> 15028.03s]  This is you know what?
[15028.03s -> 15029.63s]  I've said to myself I probably shouldn't
[15029.83s -> 15033.05s]  do this because I don't think I can do it.
[15034.06s -> 15035.10s]  I did not practice.
[15035.30s -> 15035.86s]  I promise.
[15036.24s -> 15037.84s]  I really don't think I can do this.
[15038.04s -> 15040.36s]  I don't think it's possible.
[15041.85s -> 15047.84s]  North Carolina, Vermont.
[15048.04s -> 15049.80s]  That's what I clicked. I just clicked right there.
[15050.69s -> 15057.47s]  What the fuck was that?
[15057.98s -> 15071.86s]  Arkansas.
[15072.55s -> 15073.43s]  I'm sorry.
[15075.92s -> 15077.60s]  Iowa is like here.
[15078.87s -> 15081.67s]  Fuck. I'm like I get every time I think
[15082.94s -> 15086.94s]  of where a state is, it's one inch to the right of where I'm going to click.
[15094.81s -> 15102.41s]  Idaho, Vermont, Mississippi is right here somewhere.
[15102.61s -> 15103.65s]  Where is it? Yep.
[15104.28s -> 15106.86s]  New Mexico.
[15107.06s -> 15107.82s]  That's Arizona.
[15113.31s -> 15115.03s]  I get Arizona here.
[15115.50s -> 15116.30s]  Tennessee.
[15119.49s -> 15120.69s]  Tennessee is like here.
[15123.88s -> 15125.40s]  Tennessee is like right here.
[15126.03s -> 15127.63s]  Fuck. I'm so close.
[15133.26s -> 15137.97s]  Arizona, New York, Wisconsin.
[15139.62s -> 15141.66s]  Wisconsin is like right here somewhere.
[15141.86s -> 15142.94s]  Fuck you.
[15143.70s -> 15144.90s]  Stop restarting.
[15145.41s -> 15147.05s]  Oh, I thought I had to restart.
[15148.26s -> 15151.50s]  I do have to restart.
[15151.70s -> 15152.62s]  I mean, stop restarting.
[15152.82s -> 15154.46s]  I have to replay the quiz.
[15160.34s -> 15161.42s]  I have to replay it.
[15164.55s -> 15166.47s]  Montana is like here.
[15167.94s -> 15170.42s]  Minnesota is here.
[15170.62s -> 15171.86s]  It's like right here.

[18119.81s -> 18134.29s]  hold on, let me like, I gotta zoom in, I'll cut the bottom part off, give me a sec, how

[18522.86s -> 18535.16s]  sure why, but when we see this Fortnite scheme, we want a bowl of jelly or something, that was
[18536.60s -> 18548.07s]  very cute, all right, let me just check on the neural network thing, it's still in progress,
[18548.07s -> 18555.88s]  it's taking a while, it's trying to figure out what to do, and I'm gonna do the thing I do every
[18555.88s -> 18559.96s]  time I do this, I hopefully doesn't take this, it takes between 10 minutes and 15 minutes,
[18560.60s -> 18565.24s]  we're just, we're just gonna do another fucking IQ test, like I mean, I'm gonna do this, I'm not
[18565.24s -> 18570.86s]  really ready, I haven't like eaten any protein today or anything, so I'm telling you right now,
[18570.86s -> 18575.26s]  this is probably gonna be very inaccurate, we take an IQ test every time, just to make sure that I'm
[18575.26s -> 18582.86s]  still above at least like 60 IQ, who knows, here we go again, begin assessment, the section you will
[18582.86s -> 18587.72s]  be given a word, and I don't want to listen to this music, it's fucking distracting me, in this
[18587.72s -> 18591.64s]  section, you'll be given a word and asked to select from a list of other words, which mean the same
[18591.64s -> 18595.88s]  thing, it'll be 10 answers for each question, and three to five of the answers to each question
[18595.88s -> 18602.52s]  will be correct, you get, so no more than five, you get plus one point for each correct choice you
[18602.52s -> 18606.84s]  make, and minus one point for each wrong choice, so select as many as you know, but don't guess,
[18607.56s -> 18616.33s]  go, all the words with a similar meaning as the one above, big, mammoth, large, huge, colossal,
[18616.97s -> 18641.96s]  I don't think this is a word, hippopotamon, small, yeah, done, lame, charge, cues, incopulate,
[18644.12s -> 18662.02s]  oil, borebear, borbear, harassed, indict, pulled, chilly, nippy, freezing, boreal, it's boreal,
[18662.02s -> 18672.84s]  it's boreal in here, it's boreal, it's boreal, boreal, boreal, it's so boreal in here, stop,
[18672.84s -> 18698.92s]  halt, end, terminate, degroute, vestige, reprobate, that's like a legal term, I think, maybe, short,
[18698.92s -> 18718.10s]  brief, fleeting, it's only three to five, okay, beginner, a beginner, a newcomer, a novice,
[18718.66s -> 18738.68s]  a rookie, a neophyte, greenhorn, I don't know, well greenhorn is, I don't know, thin, thin, thin,
[18739.56s -> 18752.73s]  sheer, skinny, no, sheered means see-through, skinny, narrow, um, lupay, anem, anemechel,
[18754.02s -> 18759.14s]  smiggly, there's another one at least, I don't know, these are all these words, nobody even uses
[18759.14s -> 18765.66s]  these, I don't go to Starbucks and go, oh yes, could I have a, uh, a, uh, anemechel coffee,
[18765.66s -> 18773.56s]  please, nobody uses these words in real life, I don't care how high, how smart you are, chat
[18773.56s -> 18778.81s]  can't even do this in their head, mental rotation subtest, in this section you'll be given an example
[18778.81s -> 18784.94s]  shape and asked to select from a list of other shapes which ones are the same, okay, so it has
[18784.94s -> 18789.58s]  to be the same image, for example, the two shapes below are the same just viewed from a different
[18789.58s -> 18795.58s]  direction, but the next two shapes are actually different, see the animation that shows they are
[18795.58s -> 18811.75s]  mirror images, so I have to pick the things that are the same image, which of these shapes are the
[18811.75s -> 18840.02s]  same, oh god, I'm gonna get an F, relax, not this one, this is not the same, this one, this one,
[18840.02s -> 18887.18s]  this one, I can see you guys talking, I don't want to see it, emote only right now, I, I can,
[18887.18s -> 18940.12s]  I can sense them making fun of me, this one, this doesn't tell you anything by the way, like, oh,
[18940.12s -> 18945.94s]  can you like go like this with a shape or what side is it on, no, I want practical fucking shit,
[18945.94s -> 18951.05s]  you know what I mean, I'm practically intelligent, I'm not on paper intelligent, I'm practically
[18951.05s -> 18961.50s]  intelligent, where do you use this, all right, I can, god, find me a situation where you can like
[18961.50s -> 18968.87s]  get yourself out of trouble with this one, yeah, how do you, how do you solve a problem with this one,
[18969.51s -> 18980.39s]  it's not, okay, it's not this one, it isn't, not this one,
[18981.11s -> 18988.90s]  not this one, wait, maybe it is this one, it is this one, this is going the wrong direction,
[18988.90s -> 19025.98s]  nope, it's this one, do I spin this, it's this one, spin it, this is wrong, flat, flat, this way,
[19026.78s -> 19058.50s]  stop it, one goes wing, wing, wing, goes wing, wing, wing, goes ee, oo, mm, wow, wrong, this one goes
[19059.30s -> 19072.31s]  ee, oo, mm, this one, not this one, this is incorrect, it's going the wrong way, if I take this
[19072.87s -> 19086.34s]  and I turn it, it would be going, this is correct, if I put it flat and turn it, this is wrong,
[19087.22s -> 19096.60s]  this is cringe, all right, you know what, if I, if you had 10, what, 50, 500,000 people breathing
[19096.60s -> 19099.24s]  down your neck while you take an IQ test, you don't think you'd have a little bit of trouble,
[19100.20s -> 19103.56s]  there's like 500,000 people breathing down my neck right now,
[19104.12s -> 19112.39s]  I, I can't, get away from me, let's relax and go for it, this is going this way, this one's wrong
[19112.39s -> 19120.23s]  in the lower left, I believe this one's accurate, if I flip it up, I mean this way, that way,
[19120.87s -> 19127.66s]  and if I turn it, this one's correct, this one might be correct, hold on, if I take it like this,
[19129.61s -> 19138.76s]  flip it, no, if I flip it this way, no, it's wrong, if I stand this one up, turn it, this one's
[19138.76s -> 19152.65s]  correct, yikes, what is playing right now, oh my god, this is like Fortnite music,
[19153.37s -> 19162.46s]  what do you mean, no, whatever, you take it, okay, I, can I just skip this one and just get enough,
[19162.46s -> 19175.29s]  this one, oh yeah, it goes down, it goes right down, left down, right down, left down,
[19176.09s -> 19182.68s]  so if I take this one and I flip it up, go right down, left down, holy shit, this is hard,
[19183.24s -> 19203.83s]  I turn this one, this is correct, put this up and turn it, it goes that way, down, right, down,
[19203.83s -> 19211.69s]  this is not correct, I take this one and I flip it, oh yeah, this is fucking hard, this is really
[19211.69s -> 19224.81s]  hard, if I turn this one that way, it goes wham, yeah, it's this one, all right, I'm done,
[19225.53s -> 19232.26s]  visual memory subtest, you'll be shown a grid with some cells shaded for five seconds, then you'll
[19232.26s -> 19237.54s]  have to reproduce that sample pattern from memory as best as you can, okay, so just fill in the
[19237.54s -> 19302.55s]  fill in the shades, memorize the arrangement, got it, fuck, where was this one, I don't remember,
[19322.28s -> 19329.86s]  nailed it, in this section you'll be, you will be a list, you'll see a list of scrambled letters
[19330.42s -> 19335.51s]  and asked to find as many as you can that can be unscrambled into real English words,
[19336.07s -> 19341.40s]  oh shit, okay, I have to unscrew them, I'm so bad at these ones, I'm so bad at this,
[19342.12s -> 19350.74s]  like as many, wait, hold on, like as many as possible that can be unscrambled into an English
[19350.74s -> 19412.71s]  word, okay, I think that's it, okay, okay,
[19417.48s -> 19431.88s]  that felt, fade, toughed, puffed, come back to it, easy, we, we, at,
[19435.16s -> 19447.48s]  Aaron, stop, stop, it's a test, I fucked it up, that, I've screwed it up, I can't concentrate
[19447.48s -> 19478.22s]  anymore, save, disc, rain, pale, Borg, no, that's a Star Trek word, it's not real, eight, okay,
[19478.22s -> 19510.98s]  algae, gal, plane, nail, salt, slate, shpey, peth, peths, hep, sin,
[19514.79s -> 19534.09s]  tassin, ten, waste, laro, I'm so bad at these, edard, tardy, trade, dry, I can't, it's just,
[19534.09s -> 19540.70s]  I can't do it, my brain can't do it, I can't do these, I'm so fucking bad at these, oh no,
[19541.34s -> 19546.86s]  this doesn't even mean anything, I bet you I can fucking destroy you in arm wrestling, okay,
[19546.86s -> 19551.83s]  it's an old joke, all right, in this task you'll be given a grid with some points shaded in green,
[19552.55s -> 19564.26s]  you will need to select the point that is most in the middle of all of them, the one that has
[19564.26s -> 19569.14s]  the lowest average distance from it to each of the green points, for example, in the grid below,
[19569.14s -> 19575.22s]  what point is closest to all the green, all three green points at the same time, it would be like
[19576.12s -> 19588.15s]  one, two, three, one, two, three, it's something like here maybe, here, here, two possible answers
[19588.15s -> 19596.70s]  are below, blue lines have been added to show how good each is, so it has to be like an equal
[19596.70s -> 19600.70s]  distance away from everything, like do I have that correct, did I get that right, how does it
[19600.70s -> 19608.34s]  get resident sleeper, sorry man, whatever am I, so it has to be like an equal distance away from
[19608.34s -> 19614.74s]  all of them, all right, let's just go for it, no, I got that wrong, what do you mean, it was the most
[19614.74s -> 19627.19s]  in the middle of all of them, oh, I see, okay, this one, oh, I thought I got it wrong, I was like what
[19627.19s -> 19653.00s]  the fuck, okay, what, point closest to all the points, it would have to be like up, what, oh no,
[19659.32s -> 19669.11s]  I don't know, I can't get this open, I can't physically open this, oh, it's because I have
[19669.11s -> 19677.83s]  to take the seal off, the point closest to all the green points, it just has to be one of these,
[19677.83s -> 19685.26s]  right, it doesn't matter which one, oh, that is a trick question, okay, closest to all the green
[19685.26s -> 19712.54s]  points would be like here, what, this is the point in the middle, maybe like this one, I don't know,
[19712.54s -> 19719.19s]  I thought, I'm thinking like, I don't know why I thought that, I'm thinking like they all like
[19719.19s -> 19728.82s]  meet at this point, I'm getting it wrong, Jesus Christ, it's the middle, the middle most point,
[19730.22s -> 19737.90s]  okay, it's definitely like here, or here, here, here, what the fuck are you talking about,
[19739.10s -> 19754.15s]  what, because this has to travel, this has to travel, this has to travel, this shit, who fucking
[19754.15s -> 19776.57s]  cares about this, here, oh, come on, that's close, the middle most point from here, this has to be
[19776.57s -> 19785.53s]  like here, or here, right, I don't get it, I was just the middle most point, what, I don't get it,
[19785.53s -> 19803.22s]  I don't understand how that's the middle most point, closest to all of them, holy shit, I'm gonna,
[19803.22s -> 19808.54s]  I'm gonna, they're gonna ask me if I'm, if I'm alive, I'm gonna get a thing at the end, this is
[19808.54s -> 19811.58s]  gonna say, hey, please, that's like funny, but like no like dead people can take this test,
[19812.30s -> 19827.98s]  I've been just putting this on, it's all over my mouth, that was close,
[19828.62s -> 19835.50s]  all right, it's definitely, it has to be like up here somewhere, like here, something stupid,
[19836.22s -> 19845.94s]  that was also close, the difficult ones of getting better, I almost nailed it, I'm getting better,
[19846.66s -> 19862.02s]  this is probably right in the middle, getting better, right here, I'm like within one or two
[19862.02s -> 19869.29s]  spots each time, so I'm not, I'm not upset about this, this one could be anywhere, do I have
[19869.29s -> 19886.10s]  Fortnite music on, let me get this shit off, I'm also listening to like Fortnite music, like you
[19886.10s -> 19915.18s]  don't think that's messing with my head doing the IQ test, there you go, okay, close, oh, I did,
[19915.18s -> 19921.06s]  wait, did it kick me off, did I fail, that was only like 16, I was getting too many wrong,
[19921.06s -> 19926.22s]  I got slaughter ruled, in this up test, you'll be shown a sequence of icons one at a time,
[19926.94s -> 19931.34s]  then you'll be shown eight icons and asked which were in the sequence you just saw,
[19933.26s -> 19959.42s]  so I'm gonna be shown icons, and I have to say which ones were in which order, okay, I fucked it
[19959.42s -> 19964.54s]  up, I just, I started listening to, I started doing valley music, I was just like, oh, start a
[19964.54s -> 19989.16s]  valley, it's really cool, and it was gone, one of them's not on here, wait, hold on a second,
[19989.16s -> 19993.16s]  wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, it's not showing, I'm not clicking them in sequence,
[19993.72s -> 20007.93s]  I have, oh, I, well now I have no fucking idea, I did not understand the instructions,
[20007.93s -> 20030.55s]  god, I don't know, I think this, I don't know, now I get it, it's just, it's too hard to,
[20030.55s -> 20067.61s]  it's too hard to remember these, especially, no, they put a check on it, they, they're fucking with
[20067.61s -> 20077.16s]  me, man, I mean, this was the first one, this one, no, this is, is this one, this one, this one,
[20077.16s -> 20108.49s]  this one, oh, I did it, you want to answer some research questions, no, I, okay, what is it,
[20112.26s -> 20128.81s]  get out of here, 117, oh, I don't, I don't know where I am, but, oh, I thought it was gonna be like
[20128.81s -> 20141.05s]  85, okay, 117, it's gone down, I want to make that clear, I've taken, I've taken an IQ test
[20141.05s -> 20147.46s]  before, a real one, twice, the first time I took it, and by the way, IQ test takes usually like a
[20147.46s -> 20155.26s]  couple of hours, like it takes like an hour plus, I, when I first took an IQ test when I was like
[20155.26s -> 20164.90s]  17 or so, I had 126, and then it went down to like 124, and now it's 117, I took 100, it was 124 in
[20164.90s -> 20171.91s]  college, and now it's apparently 117, it's probably lower than this, it's probably like, it's probably
[20171.91s -> 20182.70s]  like 110, probably for real, 99, look at my memory, I got, I'm doing fine, once, look at this,
[20182.70s -> 20194.18s]  come on, look at the, look where I am, this is where I sit, this isn't a real test, are you sure,
[20194.18s -> 20198.50s]  I, I thought a psychologist was giving this to me, are you sure I, we can't use this in court or
[20198.50s -> 20219.91s]  whatever, oh, IQ test of bullshit anyways, what if, imagine if I got like fucking, like 140, there,
[20220.55s -> 20229.53s]  print screen, well, this explains why I have a lot of trouble like walking around a concrete building
[20229.53s -> 20242.52s]  in Hitman, I do have a pretty good memory, pretty good, not great, pretty good, all right, what the
[20242.52s -> 20248.41s]  hell, oh wait, the neural network thing, make sure it's not, somebody's ball sack or something,
[20248.41s -> 20271.77s]  let's find out, I can't, it's hard to tell what this is, it's so hard to tell if this is like,
[20271.77s -> 20284.01s]  like an asshole or something, because I don't know, it could be, let me just make sure it's not,
[20284.57s -> 20304.10s]  hold on, yeah, I don't know, I can't tell, this is like a pair, I think it's like a pair of legs
[20304.10s -> 20307.98s]  on the left and it's like somebody's asshole, like going up to their asshole or something,
[20307.98s -> 20330.49s]  I'm not sure on it, this is, Jerma enjoys his favorite cheeseburger restaurant, what's the
[20330.49s -> 20340.74s]  website, it's a neuralblender.com apparently, I'll try another one, what should I do, let's see,
[20340.74s -> 20373.16s]  I have no idea what's gonna happen with this one, we'll see, all right, what time is it,
[20373.16s -> 20379.45s]  we could maybe time for a little bit more, what is this one, oh people, people want me to play this,
[20380.09s -> 20401.02s]  this is called Monster Breeder, is this game fun, this might take a full stream, it's really fun,
[20401.66s -> 20423.40s]  you think so, I do music, what's, somebody just said, what's this shitty music, I'm sorry, I got
[20423.40s -> 20427.64s]  my, I just had a gastric upset there, I got my, I had an epigastric reflux there for a second,
[20427.64s -> 20444.79s]  what did you say, did you say, you said Stardew Valley's music is bad, come on man, come on,
[20444.79s -> 20452.63s]  um, I'll check this out for a little bit, I've been really streaming for six hours, what the
[20452.63s -> 20468.07s]  hell happened, all right, music, why not, I'll give it a try, you spent two hours on fast food,
[20475.98s -> 20479.74s]  visit, okay, you are at your ranch, from here you can visit your monsters in the stables,
[20479.74s -> 20486.33s]  browse the breeder catalog, or get in your truck and go exploring, um, go exploring,
[20488.02s -> 20493.86s]  exploring local hot spots is a great way to find and capture wild monsters, you load up your gear
[20493.86s -> 20499.46s]  into your truck, to the north of the woods and to the east of the city, to the south of the desert,
[20499.46s -> 20506.50s]  let's go to the woods, there's a narrow path leading in, to the west is a castle or to the ranch,
[20508.65s -> 20514.06s]  let's go to the castle, drive toward the ancient stone castle, its shape seems to blacken
[20514.14s -> 20533.85s]  as a thunderstorm gathers overhead, to the east are the woods, next game, you leave your trunk,
[20534.41s -> 20538.49s]  you leave your truck in front and step toward the castle, bringing along your monster catching gear,
[20540.87s -> 20548.47s]  oh shit, passing through the castle stone entrance way, dusty room, the walls are decorated
[20548.47s -> 20562.14s]  by gray distorted paintings, stop, residents sleep ring me, you're in dusty sitting room,
[20562.14s -> 20571.86s]  the walls are decorated by, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's keep going, that's all I can do, oh no,
[20571.86s -> 20576.18s]  you're in a library, the books are packed into shelves, two stories high, occasionally a book
[20576.18s -> 20596.63s]  seems to move, should I like mark it, oh pull the book, you pull the book, the bookshelf slides open
[20596.63s -> 20606.36s]  revealing a secret passageway, that's actually kind of cool, large spiral staircase, you're in
[20606.36s -> 20617.88s]  a dungeon, there are large broken shackles on the wall, you hear boots stomping heavily, you turn
[20617.88s -> 20627.67s]  around, crikey, it's frankenstein, capture frankenstein, what, you easily bag frankenstein,
[20627.67s -> 20641.93s]  put frankenstein in the truck, this is kind of cool, this is cool, should I do this for a
[20641.93s -> 20656.49s]  whole stream, yeah, this is a whole stream, I can't, I kind of, I'm very interested in this,
[20656.49s -> 20667.88s]  yes, yes, honestly, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do this again, I'm gonna do this the whole time though,
[20667.88s -> 20674.14s]  breed frankenstein, let me get at least one more, oh gargoyle appears, capture the gargoyle,
[20674.14s -> 20690.42s]  oh you need special aerial monster catching gear, how many more, okay, this is gonna determine how
[20690.42s -> 20696.66s]  much I like this, and if I really actually want to play this, how many monsters are in the game,
[20696.66s -> 20719.24s]  just tell me, there's 120, there are 500, there's so many, there's hundreds, okay, this is actually,
[20719.24s -> 20725.18s]  this is a ghost appears, capture the ghost, okay, I got him, ghost in the truck, go back to the
[20725.18s -> 20734.42s]  ranch, all right, go to the monster staples, frankenstein, breed frankenstein with ghost,
[20734.42s -> 20740.28s]  it looks like frankenstein and ghost are mating, they're done, congratulations, you have a bald
[20740.28s -> 20761.61s]  frankenstein, frankengeist, talk, boo boo, not frankenstein, boo boo, monster, boo, so wait,
[20761.61s -> 20773.37s]  could I do frankengeist, oh you can't do it, I was gonna, why would I, no, that would be weird,
[20777.16s -> 20796.76s]  I don't know what I was just saying, I don't know what I was just saying, I'm sorry, your
[20796.76s -> 20802.14s]  telephone is ringing, answer the phone, hello, hello, hello, don't do it, I'm, people are gonna
[20802.14s -> 20807.06s]  hate me, I can't do it every time somebody says hello on camera, I'm hearing that you're breeding
[20807.06s -> 20812.66s]  some groundbreaking new monster crosses, would you be interested in selling, are you a cop,
[20812.66s -> 20818.90s]  no way, yes, I'm selling, wonderful, can you sell me a monster like this, slow moving,
[20819.46s -> 20826.62s]  clothed, transparent, and magical, I got a frankengeist for you, frankengeist sounds great,
[20826.62s -> 20838.55s]  200, 200 bucks, do the staples, do the catalog, this is, yeah, we're doing this, but not now,
[20838.55s -> 20842.25s]  I'm probably gonna wrap up in a minute, how long have I been live for,
[20843.53s -> 20895.59s]  I'll be back on Sunday, oh well let me check on the art thing, this one sucks, where's god,
[20895.59s -> 20917.38s]  Jerma is the one weekend a month dad everyone wants to hang out with, all right, I'm probably
[20917.38s -> 20921.88s]  gonna wrap it up, wait, I need to get to exactly six hours, how long do I have to do for that,
[20921.88s -> 20925.88s]  how much time, how much time, I haven't looked at my dashboard the whole stream,
