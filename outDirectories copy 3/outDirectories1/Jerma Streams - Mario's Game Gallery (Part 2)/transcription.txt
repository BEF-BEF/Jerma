[1.34s -> 5.77s]  What the hell was the name of this game? It wasn't Mario Yahtzee, it was something else.
[5.77s -> 12.92s]  What was it called? It was like Mario's Game Night or something. Mario's Game Time.
[12.92s -> 36.12s]  What the hell is this thing called? Mario Game Gallery? Yeah, it was called Mario's Game Gallery.
[36.12s -> 61.69s]  That's the one. Thank you. Let's play some Yahtzee Mario. What's that buzzing sound? I don't know.
[61.69s -> 70.33s]  What is that buzzing sound? Interplay. Along with Presage, proudly presented.
[72.79s -> 83.99s]  There it is. That buzzing. Mario's Game Gallery. I don't know why this sounds so harsh right now.
[92.65s -> 107.05s]  All right, let me get the bits from last night. What the fuck is happening?
[107.85s -> 118.89s]  Let's get this over here. Sorry. This is from all the way back. I think I can get them all on here.
[119.53s -> 138.38s]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun. I don't know if there's a way I can get this.
[139.90s -> 144.78s]  Because this is from earlier today, but how do I get them from yesterday?
[145.74s -> 156.71s]  Oh, the delay too. Yeah, you're right. I gotta get rid of that. It should be gone now.
[157.43s -> 167.85s]  Yeah, I'm on the German mustard side, but where um... how do I pull from yesterday? Minimum bits.
[168.65s -> 180.41s]  The restore button. Oh, okay, right. All right, here we go. So these are the bits from yesterday.
[181.13s -> 186.41s]  We're gonna start at the bottom here, and we're gonna play Mario Yahtzee.
[190.22s -> 202.84s]  I know you are, Mario. Just wait a minute. I know you are. Hold on, Mario. I actually
[203.80s -> 226.39s]  need to do this. Sorry. He's freaking me out. What is this one? I gotta pull the Chrome window.
[227.03s -> 241.22s]  I know, Mario. Just wait, Mario. I'm trying. Going from PS3 to capture windows. There he is.
[241.86s -> 262.14s]  Hey, Mario. There he is. I told you guys you'd see him. Hi, Mario. All right, so let's go back while
[262.14s -> 276.63s]  I do Yahtzee. Is it loud? It's not that loud, right? So we're just gonna go through. This is from
[276.63s -> 285.43s]  yesterday. Thank you to Walrus Incarnation for the five dollars. I say you're probably the only
[285.43s -> 292.30s]  streamer I'm going to cheer for, to be honest. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I really
[292.30s -> 302.54s]  appreciate the fact that you'd give me any money at all. Thank you. For Fusroboto, thank you for
[302.54s -> 312.57s]  the five dollars. I say peepee poo poo butthole. Great. I don't have any way to respond to that,
[312.57s -> 327.19s]  other than what I just said. Let's go. Thank you C4G for the 250. With the release of the new
[327.19s -> 331.35s]  Hearthstone expansion, will we see the triumphant return of Germadon85 as the number one Hearthstone
[331.35s -> 335.43s]  streamer on Twitch? Looking forward to the comeback of the Chicken League champion.
[336.76s -> 344.68s]  Uh, no. I don't think I'm ever going to play Hearthstone ever again. Try to go for the sixes?
[345.32s -> 351.35s]  I could, I could just take choice right now. What do you guys think?
[357.99s -> 362.34s]  I'm just going to take choice. Or roll the fours?
[365.70s -> 373.19s]  Let's try the fours. What are the fives?
[373.99s -> 382.79s]  Those are not good. I should have just taken the choice. I should have listened to my gut.
[382.79s -> 388.20s]  Should have listened to my, could I get a straight here though? One, I need a two.
[388.20s -> 396.39s]  I get to roll the threes. Should I just roll the threes? It's not going to be fours. I'm going
[396.39s -> 407.43s]  for the threes. All right. That's good for me. Okay. No four of a kind. No, not with threes.
[408.31s -> 416.49s]  Three. That's pretty damn good. Uh, Sergio Butt. Thank you Sergio Butt for the 250. I've been sick
[416.49s -> 420.17s]  for the past few days and I had to miss work. I've been living off your vods to help me feel better.
[420.17s -> 428.65s]  Thanks. Get better soon. Thank you for the 250, Sergio. This was yesterday, but hopefully you're
[428.65s -> 438.12s]  feeling better. What'd you just do? I'm an idiot. 13. Killer Crocomire. $50 from yesterday.
[440.14s -> 452.54s]  5,000 bits earlier yesterday. Night. Straight. Two, three, four. Oh, no, go back. I'll go backwards.
[454.17s -> 468.84s]  Five, six, five, four, three, two. I need a four. I'm going for it. Four. Not a four. That's not a
[468.84s -> 491.38s]  four. Four. Shit. It's all right. Do I just take the two here? Two's are, uh, that's, I'm going to
[491.38s -> 501.62s]  take the two because aces. Why would I do that? About Killer Crocomire, thank you so much for the
[501.62s -> 511.74s]  $50. Some of you guys give 50 bucks all the fucking time and all I can say is thanks. He's going to
[511.74s -> 515.90s]  get six here, isn't he? Thank you, Demonic Cucumber for the 250. Hey, Jerma. Haven't been able to
[515.90s -> 520.06s]  catch a stream recently, so it's nice to be able to laugh along with Chad again. Uh, he's going to
[520.06s -> 530.42s]  get, he's going to get six. Let's not do it. That's all right. I'll take it. Uh, but they say, anyway,
[530.42s -> 534.18s]  seeing as Minecraft has made a comeback recently, wondering if you'd ever consider going back to it
[534.18s -> 539.70s]  for a playthrough. I genuinely would like to see that in a non-jokey way. Anyway, love the stuff,
[539.70s -> 548.87s]  man. Keep it up. I don't know. I don't think I'll ever go back to Minecraft. This is really, okay,
[548.87s -> 560.44s]  done. Um, no, VR was different because it was VR and it was VR Minecraft and it was something
[560.44s -> 575.27s]  I haven't seen before. He's going to get a streak. It's all right, but probably not. Not unless there
[575.27s -> 587.00s]  was a very significant reason to go back to do it. Just try to get some ones here, but thank you for
[587.00s -> 596.42s]  the 250. Uh, thank you, Life Pies for the five bucks. Should I maybe change this to four? Go
[596.42s -> 601.16s]  for a full house? No, that's a terrible full house. I might change it to four though, but that's
[601.16s -> 612.52s]  risky. That's too risky because I only have two. I'm just going to do the ones. Uh, but Life Pies,
[612.52s -> 624.71s]  thanks for the five dollars. No message, just five bucks. Thank you. Uh, chunky baloney gave
[624.71s -> 629.11s]  $50. I remember catching this one though, cause he said, uh, this is my kind of chunky stream.
[629.83s -> 633.83s]  I think that I talked about like, I don't know, diapers or something, whatever. We talk about
[633.83s -> 641.50s]  diapers like fucking five out of every 10 screams. Thank you though. Uh, Dead Medic,
[641.50s -> 644.30s]  thanks for the 10 bucks. Hey, Jerma, as someone who's never played Terraria before,
[644.30s -> 648.22s]  it's been a lot of fun watching your playthroughs and learning the game alongside you.
[649.02s -> 652.30s]  You're doing great. You should hunt down the flame lash. Yeah, I'm going to,
[654.20s -> 660.26s]  I'm going to try to get that thing. Is diaper still banned? Can anybody write that word?
[665.91s -> 671.90s]  Oh, it still is. That's funny. No, not anymore. Oh, is it as it should be?
[673.34s -> 682.39s]  Well, we've got a, I'm going for it. Give me a huge full house here. Give me a five,
[682.39s -> 685.75s]  give me a six. This is the best full house you can possibly get in the whole game. Let's see it.
[692.50s -> 703.78s]  Damn it. But yeah, I, Terraria is great. I've been having a great time with it.
[706.87s -> 711.22s]  I'm at least going to play to the end of the game. Star and I will continue to do it.
[711.22s -> 716.71s]  But it's something you'll see on the channel for at least the foreseeable few weeks. I think
[717.35s -> 724.49s]  it's fun to learn though. Also purple rose tattoo. Thanks to the five dolls.
[726.63s -> 731.11s]  Just wanted to say, I'm going through some substance abuse recovery
[732.55s -> 736.23s]  and your content has helped me distract me from the pains of DT and want to drink.
[737.61s -> 746.86s]  I'm really sorry to hear you going through that. I don't have any personal experience with
[747.58s -> 751.10s]  dealing with something like substance abuse, but I've heard it's very, very difficult.
[751.74s -> 762.20s]  Take care of yourself. Wish you the best. And if my content, if this community can help you with
[762.20s -> 769.90s]  anything, I'm fucking very happy that you can have a place here to relax. Thank you though.
[770.46s -> 774.94s]  Good luck. Keep at it and take care of yourself. Thank you. Purple rose tattoo. Thanks for the five
[774.94s -> 786.26s]  dolls. Okay. Where are we at here? What do I want to do here? Roll the two? No, I have to roll the
[786.26s -> 800.18s]  fours. No, it's a small straight. A big, a big straight would be, what's the difference between
[800.18s -> 806.06s]  small and a big? Oh, right. Because it's, it's only four. Five is the big straight, right?
[807.59s -> 816.60s]  How close am I to that? Four, five, six. I need a two. I could do it. I need a two. Come on,
[816.60s -> 836.36s]  Mario. Give it to me. What's going on with my life right now? Two, three, four, five, six. Okay. I
[836.36s -> 856.98s]  need a two. Here it comes. It's going to be a two. Told you. What the hell is shit?
[859.14s -> 862.82s]  Gold finger. Thanks for the 15 dollars. Gold finger. How much do you bench? I used to be able
[862.82s -> 870.60s]  to bench like 180, 200. That was like 160 pounds. It was pretty damn good. I could do like 180 to
[870.60s -> 878.14s]  200. Like three or four times. Currently getting my ass kicked. But thanks for the 15 dollars. Gold
[878.14s -> 883.48s]  finger. Uh, I don't even like Taco Bell. Gave 250. German, it's okay. I have ad block.
[887.16s -> 894.89s]  What do you want me to say? What do you want me to tell you? I'm going to lose to Mario? Actually,
[894.89s -> 905.19s]  I swept Mario last time I played this. At this stage in the game, I think it's time to go for
[905.19s -> 919.08s]  the full house. He only has a 13 for a full house. Or four of a kind. No, that's bad. Just four of
[919.08s -> 930.07s]  a kind with twos is terrible. Go for the straight? I need a lot for the straight. I already have the
[930.07s -> 940.34s]  twos. I need a three and a six. I'm dumping the whole thing. Uh, but thank you. I don't even like
[940.34s -> 962.12s]  Taco Bell, but the 250. Appreciate it. One, two, three, four. Ah, come on. Five. Okay. This is the
[962.12s -> 975.40s]  best two out of three Mario. I'm going to lose. I know I am. It's over. Thank you Sad Vega for the
[975.48s -> 982.14s]  250. German, I'm thinking of getting the WWE wrestling game. I saw 2k18 was on sale.
[982.70s -> 985.98s]  Have you used this one to mod make German rumbles and how hard is it to set up?
[987.10s -> 993.02s]  Which one is easy to mod? There's really no mods that are any, any real game changers for the
[993.02s -> 1006.62s]  WWE games that are on PC. They're like costumes and created characters. Every WWE game after
[1006.62s -> 1015.74s]  2k14 is awful. They just kind of stopped caring after 2k14. Once it came to the new engine and
[1015.74s -> 1022.95s]  they started to really put it into like the game simulation, not the thing to do for fun. Plus,
[1022.95s -> 1028.76s]  I heard the drama of, uh, isn't Yuke's, didn't they break off? Yuke's decided to go make their
[1028.76s -> 1032.84s]  own wrestling game and 2k still makes, there's going to be another, uh, wrestling game made by
[1032.84s -> 1043.45s]  Yuke's. However that plays out, I wonder because once 2k really got involved in visual concepts,
[1043.45s -> 1048.49s]  started to kind of do some development on the game is when it really kind of, um, took a huge
[1048.49s -> 1056.52s]  nosedive as a franchise. Maybe the one from Yuke's will be more interesting. I don't know. I keep
[1056.52s -> 1076.04s]  getting this just shit. I need a, I just mathematically, I don't think I went, I need a two and there it is.
[1076.04s -> 1079.88s]  Okay, but I don't think I can win math. I need a Yahtzee to mathematically have a chance.
[1080.60s -> 1087.78s]  But thank you, sad Vega. I would say get 2k14, but it's also very slow and it takes a long time to
[1087.78s -> 1092.18s]  load anything you do with created character, but it has a much better character creator than the
[1092.18s -> 1097.35s]  other ones. Or wait for Yuke's to come out with their new game coming up probably in a year or two.
[1098.07s -> 1098.87s]  Maybe, we'll see.
[1099.43s -> 1108.14s]  It's going on the deuces line. Deuces. It's your turn. Thank you Drosophilia for the 250.
[1108.14s -> 1112.70s]  Hey Jeremy, here's a throwback to a recitier. Wanted to play the game myself before watching
[1112.70s -> 1118.14s]  you and I lost my house twice and reloaded before I finally beat the game on loop one.
[1121.24s -> 1126.92s]  Mario, you're like really fucking interrupting me. Finally beat the game on loop one. Only after
[1126.92s -> 1130.76s]  I watched you I did, I realized that you keep your items and levels and that losing is actually
[1130.76s -> 1143.50s]  a part of the game. Yeah, I got, I lost once and then went back and did some tactical video gaming
[1143.50s -> 1151.53s]  and kept my items and money. Or not my money, my items. I'm throwing a Hail Mary here I think.
[1152.25s -> 1176.12s]  I wonder, should I, I gotta go for a full house. There it is. I have a mathematical chance. It's
[1176.12s -> 1186.28s]  possible. Yeah, that was a great game. It was really fun, really interesting. 50 dollars from
[1186.28s -> 1190.20s]  La Cranda. Oh yeah, I remember this one. This is the peepee poo poo comment. There was like three
[1190.20s -> 1196.57s]  peepee poo poo, 50 dollar donations over the last two days. That's 50 bucks guys. That's a lot of
[1196.57s -> 1201.51s]  money. Don't get a Yahtzee, don't get a Yahtzee, don't get a Yahtzee, don't get a Yahtzee.
[1207.45s -> 1213.56s]  Thank you Favorite Sage for the five dollars. Favorite Sage says, hey Jeremy, you and Vinny
[1213.56s -> 1218.36s]  are my favorite people on the internet and I was able to meet Vinny today at the retro games expo.
[1219.40s -> 1230.79s]  That's awesome. Was wondering if you'd ever ever attend any event. Mario, stop it! I was wondering
[1230.79s -> 1239.64s]  if you'd be attending any events near New York anytime soon. Uh, I'm gonna have to say no. New
[1239.64s -> 1245.13s]  York is, there's no real conventions I don't think or anything I'd be doing in New York.
[1246.22s -> 1253.98s]  I didn't even go back to Boston for PAX East this year, so probably not unless there was some
[1255.70s -> 1263.80s]  reason for me to be there I guess. I've kind of been dialing back the amount of conventions
[1263.80s -> 1275.67s]  I've been going to. I think what really, I muted him. I think after, I went, I've been to probably,
[1276.23s -> 1279.80s]  I used to go to like three, four plus conventions every year.
[1280.20s -> 1283.83s]  Hey, what's it take you so long?
[1283.83s -> 1287.83s]  I, okay, I muted him, but it doesn't matter. I guess I have to do something else. I'm gonna
[1287.83s -> 1298.66s]  mute him here. I hard muted him. That shouldn't happen anymore. But after doing, I did a lot of
[1298.66s -> 1303.70s]  conventions, three, four plus five sometimes in a year, and it just takes a lot out of me.
[1304.65s -> 1310.71s]  Now more than ever, traveling is just, I kind of would rather just stick around and work on stuff
[1310.79s -> 1317.46s]  and stream and, you know, kind of just hang out and do my own thing. That's not to say that I don't
[1317.46s -> 1321.46s]  want to go to conventions, or that I think conventions aren't worth going to or anything,
[1321.46s -> 1333.94s]  but I started to really dial it back probably a couple years ago. You can still hear him.
[1340.78s -> 1350.42s]  You can. You can hear it through my headphones. But stuff like TwitchCon is close, so I will
[1350.42s -> 1356.60s]  probably always just poke my head around there once every year or so whenever it comes around.
[1357.30s -> 1366.02s]  Other things, probably no more PAXs, I don't think. I've been to a lot of them. Maybe E3
[1366.02s -> 1373.58s]  when it comes around again, especially next year because the consoles. But no, I've been
[1373.58s -> 1383.77s]  dialing back conventions. And then of course, Jermacon coming up in Las Vegas, but thank you.
[1383.77s -> 1390.98s]  I appreciate it. And thank you for even putting me in the same company as Vinny. He's been around
[1390.98s -> 1397.70s]  for a long time. I'm honored to even be put in the same sentence as somebody like that, so thank you.
[1400.46s -> 1406.23s]  He's got a great stream. All right, Mario, I'm going to bring you back. Are you going to
[1408.22s -> 1421.70s]  be good, Mario? Okay, he's quieted down. We need sixes. I don't have, I mean, there's no six here.
[1421.70s -> 1445.29s]  I'm going to have to go for a Yahtzee. Just throw the whole thing away. I lose. I need six, four.
[1445.29s -> 1453.14s]  I need four of kind of sixes. What is he looking for? Foures? He's looking for Yahtzee. C4G,
[1453.14s -> 1456.98s]  thanks for the 250. Also, thanks for mentioning Card Crawl. I just downloaded to check it out,
[1457.80s -> 1464.12s]  and this shit slaps. Card Crawl is the best mobile game you can possibly own.
[1466.84s -> 1471.96s]  There is not a better game that is a handheld game that is better than Card Crawl. It's the best
[1471.96s -> 1485.98s]  fucking digital mobile video game. If you don't believe me, go get it. I need a Yahtzee.
[1488.20s -> 1497.05s]  This is how it happens. This is the dream right here. Here comes the dream right here. Two sixes.
[1497.05s -> 1511.62s]  Bingo. Or four. Four of a kind. All right, I still have a chance. I need a Yahtzee. Yeah,
[1511.62s -> 1516.28s]  check out Card Crawl. It's great. I made a video on it like three or four years ago.
[1519.08s -> 1523.99s]  Hey, snoozingcopter, thanks for the 250. It's my birthday today.
[1523.99s -> 1532.18s]  Okay, thanks for Terraria and DOS stream. DOS is always a blast. Yeah, there's at least one game
[1532.18s -> 1540.79s]  that's an absolute highlight. That does happen. DOS is weird. Very extreme. It's either very,
[1540.79s -> 1549.40s]  very bad or very, very good. I think that's kind of the fun pick it out of a hat scenario.
[1551.10s -> 1559.38s]  I do love it though. And then they say, anyway, can I get a happy birthday message shout out
[1559.38s -> 1565.14s]  that lasts at least for five minutes? Thank you. See you next stream. Yeah, at least five minutes.
[1566.26s -> 1575.14s]  Snoozingcopter, happy birthday. Happy birthday. We're going for Yahtzee. This Yahtzee is for you,
[1575.14s -> 1585.54s]  snoozingcopter. Happy Yahtzee birthday. I don't think we're going to get a Yahtzee birthday.
[1585.54s -> 1599.27s]  We didn't get a Yahtzee birthday. Birthday ruins. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1600.31s -> 1604.81s]  Happy birthday, snoozingcopter, for real. Let's do another one. Let's go again, Mario.
[1605.77s -> 1612.17s]  But yes, for real, happy birthday. Have a good one. Chunkybaloney, thanks to Chunkybaloney for
[1612.17s -> 1615.53s]  the five dollars. Hey, thanks for playing Museum Madness. Brings back memories of when I beat it
[1615.53s -> 1619.05s]  when I was eight. So I'm sure you can finish it. I would have finished it, but my computer
[1619.05s -> 1627.67s]  fucking crashed. My internet turned off. Fusroboto, thanks for the five dollars. Hey, Germa, I'm the
[1627.67s -> 1632.71s]  peepee poo poo butthole fart guy from earlier. Oh, hey, hey, it's you. This dinosaur skeleton
[1632.71s -> 1637.19s]  has triggered my backseat gamer instincts more than anything else you've ever done. Get good.
[1637.51s -> 1644.49s]  Your role. Imagine introducing yourself as the peepee poo poo butthole fart guy.
[1645.13s -> 1650.09s]  Nice to meet you, yeah. What's your name? Oh, my name's Jeremy. Oh, yeah, hey,
[1650.97s -> 1660.97s]  peepee poo poo butthole fart guy. Just call me, uh, call me Rick. Uh, okay. Hey, Lizard Boy.
[1660.97s -> 1668.76s]  Thanks for the ten bucks, Lizard Boy. Ten dollars from Lizard Boy. Hey, Germa, I wanted to give back
[1668.76s -> 1674.02s]  after all the laughter and joy you've given me over the past eight years. It's a long time.
[1674.02s -> 1681.08s]  Since I was a wee 11-year-old lad, I'm now 19 and have been suffering from severe depression
[1681.08s -> 1686.23s]  over the last three years. Sometimes when it feels all like it's going to come crashing down,
[1686.23s -> 1693.22s]  all it takes is turning on a water stream. If I wake up in time, stream start at 6 a.m. in Singapore.
[1693.22s -> 1697.45s]  Time zones are all over the place. They really are. To make me feel better, thanks for all the
[1697.45s -> 1711.58s]  great times. Here's to more. Thank you so much, Lizard Boy. I really appreciate that. Much love
[1711.58s -> 1720.97s]  to you. Across the world, if you had told like 16-year-old me that there was going to be a
[1720.97s -> 1729.50s]  scenario where I would be able to reach somebody that was that far away and that enjoyed the stuff
[1729.50s -> 1739.08s]  that I was doing that much, I don't think I would have believed you. Thank you so much for sticking
[1739.08s -> 1747.42s]  around. I really hope that you get through whatever's going on. Almost at the 10-year mark,
[1747.42s -> 1761.16s]  please stick around in this community. You're all fucking hilarious. Join the Discord if you haven't.
[1761.24s -> 1769.18s]  It's a great place. I look forward to saying hello to you at the 10-year.
[1771.80s -> 1775.51s]  Mario, you're gonna get muted again. I'm going for the fives.
[1780.34s -> 1785.94s]  But that was Lizard Boy. Thank you so much, Lizard Boy. For real. Four fives. Come on, let's see it.
[1791.21s -> 1797.88s]  Do I take the fives or do I take the choice? Five is the choice. 23 is not bad.
[1801.14s -> 1804.02s]  Three fives is not bad either, but 23 is not bad for choice.
[1807.59s -> 1813.27s]  I'll take it. Dr. Clay, thanks for the five dollars, Dr. Clay. I played that Museum Madness
[1813.27s -> 1818.39s]  game as a kid. There was a lot of puzzles. I often had no clue what to do. I still had fun though.
[1818.39s -> 1824.07s]  It was nice seeing it again. I appreciate the nostalgia. Take care. It was an interesting game.
[1828.28s -> 1842.12s]  And that takes us up to the current bits from today. Currently in a decent position here.
[1842.12s -> 1850.07s]  With three dollars earlier. Three bucks from SirK9. They say German is mad, part 69.
[1852.41s -> 1858.01s]  I didn't get that mad tonight. I got, look, I got visibly frustrated during the ice level.
[1861.02s -> 1874.46s]  Right? Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. Why is everyone saying nice? All right, do I do,
[1875.74s -> 1882.04s]  I could try for a full house. Should I go for the full house opportunity with the, that's,
[1882.04s -> 1890.97s]  that's a decent middle of the road full house. Or should I go for a small straight? Two, three,
[1891.29s -> 1907.40s]  four, five, double the straight. Let's go for it. There it is. Thank you back in for the 250.
[1907.40s -> 1914.36s]  Watch that 180. Watch that 180. It'll creep up on you. Thank you back in though. Appreciate
[1914.36s -> 1924.15s]  the 250. Where's that, Demonic Cucumber gave two dollars and 50 cents. Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[1924.15s -> 1931.03s]  I find it weird that you've banned diaper, dia space per jokes in your chat. Seeing as
[1931.03s -> 1936.07s]  you had one in your old demo reel. By the way, I'm not a stalker. This is in chat. I know people,
[1936.07s -> 1941.70s]  that's whatever. I don't care. Don't forget the bits from yesterday. I already did. Um, no,
[1941.70s -> 1948.95s]  it's not that I'm banning diaper jokes. I'm not banning diaper. All right, yo, we're almost at
[1948.95s -> 1956.30s]  that last straw where you get muted permanently. I mean, like on the, like they have audio of the
[1956.30s -> 1965.26s]  stream. Audio of the stream. I'm going to make that very clear. Anyways.
[1967.67s -> 1975.77s]  Mama mia, yeah, I know. Um, it wasn't the fact that they would. It's going to happen. All right,
[1975.77s -> 1981.91s]  I'm rolling. It wasn't the fact that diaper jokes were in the chat. It was 50% of all chat was diaper
[1981.91s -> 1997.61s]  related for two straight hours. I couldn't even read. We were talking about Terraria and in between
[1997.69s -> 2004.62s]  stuff. I'm talking about Terraria was like diaper spam. Who's fault is it? It's my fault,
[2004.62s -> 2015.59s]  but that means I have to correct it. Are you so good now? But thank you. Demotic key coming
[2015.59s -> 2022.23s]  from the two 50. Uh, this person has smashed. It's a smashed keyboard name. It's just a smashed
[2022.23s -> 2028.50s]  keyboard. Uh, thanks for the 10 bucks. Hey, Jerma, are you going to play electronic super joy too?
[2028.50s -> 2039.51s]  It just released today and it's free on steam. I, I made a video on electronic
[2039.51s -> 2053.05s]  super joy like seven years ago. That is the right game, right? Electronic super joy. I did
[2053.77s -> 2063.80s]  somebody find it. It's there somewhere from like 2012 or something. I might give it a try. You
[2063.80s -> 2072.01s]  forgot. I forgot about that video too until you just said electronic super joy too. It's time for
[2072.01s -> 2077.37s]  slime. Thanks for the 10 bucks. Uh, the Jerma DOS video I made seemed well received. I made a second
[2077.37s -> 2081.19s]  one. Thought you and chat would enjoy it. Well, we're going to wait till the end of the stream for
[2081.19s -> 2088.18s]  this one. Absolutely going to watch this. Thank you. It's time for slime for 10 bucks and I can't
[2088.18s -> 2096.82s]  wait to watch this video. Thank you. What do I want to do here? Let's go with twos. I think
[2097.54s -> 2107.74s]  yeah, or one, two, I could do one, two, three. No, just the twos, twos. Let's get some twos.
[2111.18s -> 2114.94s]  Hey, look at that. That's pretty good. We might be able to get a Yahtzee.
[2119.37s -> 2148.76s]  Oh, don't get a Yahtzee.
[2154.01s -> 2161.37s]  I could feel collectively all of you sink down in your seat and like your neck stuffs into you and
[2161.37s -> 2168.41s]  just like, ah, I could feel it. There's like thousands of you that did that. I don't know
[2168.41s -> 2171.29s]  how many, I can't even see how many people are here right now, but I could feel it.
[2179.34s -> 2186.06s]  At least half of you guys just turtled down into your shoulders. You keep digging yourself bigger
[2186.06s -> 2192.10s]  and bigger hole with that joke. I know, but it's fucking like midnight pacific. You know,
[2192.10s -> 2202.70s]  what's the big deal? It's fine. Nobody's going to see that shit anyways. You guys,
[2202.70s -> 2210.12s]  you guys like the late night crew. That's a potential for a big straight.
[2214.10s -> 2216.42s]  Thank you spliceable spleen for the five dollars.
[2218.42s -> 2221.46s]  Jerma, I know you're suffering quite a lot right now, but honestly, the streams where you are
[2221.46s -> 2225.30s]  borderline meltdown or full on meltdown are my favorite. Please continue to get angry.
[2225.94s -> 2241.64s]  This is not a big straight. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Let's go five. What do you think?
[2241.64s -> 2247.99s]  What's more, what's possible? A five or a five? I just need a five. Doesn't matter. It's just a
[2247.99s -> 2255.34s]  five. No matter what. Okay. Whatever. I'm an idiot. One, two, three, four, two, three, four,
[2255.34s -> 2283.48s]  four. It's a five every time. Just go. Shit. Come on. Yeah, but I don't like to go too far
[2283.48s -> 2291.32s]  and getting upset at stuff. Doesn't happen that often. And of course he like he fucking top decks
[2291.32s -> 2299.19s]  a big straight. Then he needs to roll. Thanks Mario. Cyrus Dexter, thanks for the five dollars.
[2299.19s -> 2304.95s]  No message. It's five bucks. Thank you, Cyrus. Thank you Espada Escarlata for the 250.
[2306.23s -> 2309.03s]  Here's some bits. Hope you feel better after beating or giving up on this game,
[2309.03s -> 2318.10s]  whichever happens. I beat it, but I do appreciate the fact that it was either way. Thank you. All
[2318.10s -> 2326.71s]  right. What am I going to do? Big straight again. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four,
[2326.71s -> 2357.62s]  five, four. Please. This is so, I need this. Uh, thank you to Mr. Rad HD for the four dollars.
[2357.62s -> 2368.18s]  I love Jerma. He's a cute boy with a nice man face. Wow. Good boy. Thank you. He already has sixes,
[2368.18s -> 2374.73s]  right? No, he doesn't. Shit. Thank you, Mr. Rad HD for the kind of sixes.
[2377.77s -> 2381.91s]  Bala Koala, thanks for the five dollars. Hey, Jerma, just want to say thanks for all the laughs
[2381.91s -> 2387.90s]  and smiles. Your streams always seem to be able to brighten up my stressful day. My pleasure. Thank
[2387.90s -> 2395.94s]  you for the five bucks and thanks for hanging out. Without you, there is no stream. Collectively,
[2395.94s -> 2414.54s]  all of you. Thank you. How do I have a Yahtzee and still going to lose this damn game? Do I just hold
[2414.54s -> 2433.50s]  the six and just throw it all away? I'm getting the one, two, three, four, one, two, two, three,
[2433.50s -> 2446.26s]  four, five. Now what the fuck do I do? I keep getting this shit over and over again. You want
[2446.26s -> 2449.38s]  a two, three, a four, and a five? You want a five, a two, and a three, and a four? You want a four?
[2449.38s -> 2456.87s]  You want, uh, there's, uh, hair on the fly, on the frog, on the dog, on the dog, on the dog,
[2456.87s -> 2478.38s]  on the dog, on the seat. Here it comes. Oh, yeah. Enjoy playing with you. Okay. We had, uh, that was

[2492.44s -> 2501.70s]  Uh, Colusia. Colusia, thanks for the 250. This stream is amazing. Oh my god, my stomach still
[2501.70s -> 2505.70s]  hurts from laughing. Thanks for always brightening my day and being my favorite content creator.
[2505.70s -> 2509.06s]  You've done so much for my mental health lately. Love you, Jerma. Thank you.
[2509.54s -> 2517.35s]  Amiya. It's always great when a game and a stream just kind of click together, and it's one of those
[2518.07s -> 2522.97s]  I was, I was laughing my ass off, at least for the first like four and a half straight hours of this
[2522.97s -> 2527.85s]  stream. And it doesn't happen every single time, right? You obviously know everything's the funniest
[2527.85s -> 2531.37s]  fucking thing you've ever seen in your life, right? But when stuff just kind of clicks together,
[2532.09s -> 2554.14s]  it's just, I love it. This is a great time. This is important. I need this full house. And there it
[2554.14s -> 2560.62s]  is. Oh, you're so good. Just need a big straight and I pretty much win the game no matter what.
[2561.18s -> 2573.85s]  I have to get the straight though. Uh, Bala Koala gave $50 and had something very important to say.
[2573.85s -> 2581.05s]  Again, this is another $50 peepee poo poo comment. What's going on the fours line?
[2581.93s -> 2598.68s]  Peepee poo poo. Okie dokie. Your move. $50. I could buy a PlayStation 4 Pro with the amount of
[2598.68s -> 2602.12s]  peepee poo poo $50 comments that came through over the last two days.
[2604.87s -> 2612.50s]  Mario, I know. I just want to make sure that everyone's with that. You guys are aware of that?
[2613.54s -> 2618.42s]  You know, you could have given me a $5 or a dollar. You could have just put like $2.50 and
[2618.42s -> 2628.23s]  said poo poo pee poo, poo pee pee poo poo, whatever the fucking thing is. That's a lot of money for
[2628.23s -> 2634.39s]  peepee poo poo. And I've said it, maybe this is the point. I've said it like fucking 12 times.
[2635.27s -> 2644.84s]  That's a telephone call. I'm going to answer that. It's going to be peepee poo poo.
[2648.46s -> 2658.09s]  I need, uh, I'm going to go four of a kind. Let's go. Let's do it. Four of a kind. Sixes.
[2658.09s -> 2671.50s]  One. Two. No. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Mistake. It was a mistake.
[2671.50s -> 2700.09s]  It was a mistake. It was a mistake. I'm doing fours. That's fine. I'll take it.
[2704.68s -> 2709.54s]  Come on, Mario. Let me get this win. I need to get this win. We're almost at the end of the bits.
[2712.79s -> 2718.84s]  Nooces. I need a four. A good look, a good four of a kind and a straight ends this.
[2723.42s -> 2727.58s]  Six. Five. Six. Five. Four. Three. Ahhh.
[2730.65s -> 2740.44s]  I need the two. Give me the two. Give me the two. Give me the two. Do it.
[2754.90s -> 2758.26s]  Maverick's — Thank you Maverick for the $5. Not sure where I get these bits, but here's to you,

[2763.87s -> 2767.98s]  We had our ten bucks from not so crippling depression for ten dollars
[2767.98s -> 2772.90s]  Hey, just wanted to let you know you can build a sword that lets you go extremely fast into area called Snow White
[2775.08s -> 2778.64s]  You should also have all the needed materials really
[2779.28s -> 2780.92s]  What'd he do? Oh
[2780.92s -> 2785.81s]  No, he just it just don't get a Yahtzee and I win. That's fine
[2786.33s -> 2793.53s]  Cuz I'm not paying attention to him to me. Oh, he had four sixes. I wasn't even looking
[2795.60s -> 2799.40s]  Speaking of sixes, we're just going for it. I just gotta get some points
[2799.60s -> 2805.56s]  It doesn't matter mathematically if I get a leave I win. He just doesn't I don't care. Well, okay, that's um
[2806.88s -> 2811.84s]  Should I just take it? I'm just gonna take it. No, that's awful. None of this matters. I don't it doesn't matter
[2822.93s -> 2824.93s]  Yahtzee loses any I lose anyways, I
