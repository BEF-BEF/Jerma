[25.59s -> 40.09s]  Now it didn't take me 15 minutes to write a tweet. I wanted to make sure that my drink was chilled, cool, cold, didn't have any ice, put it into the freezer.
[40.09s -> 48.46s]  I was told don't do that because your drink will explode. And I was just like, what? This is just baiting me for something weird, right? Like, what do you mean?
[48.46s -> 57.13s]  Dude, don't put your drink in the freezer for five minutes. It's gonna explode.
[59.39s -> 69.42s]  What? And then I was told, well, if you put a can or, you know, something that has, you know, compressed air, don't do that, right? Of course.
[70.60s -> 80.10s]  But this is just me putting a cup in the freezer for like five minutes to chill it out. It is true. It's true. Well, don't be careful then. I didn't know that.
[80.10s -> 96.54s]  I mean, I knew about if you like a can of soda, you don't want to really do that. Good night, Jerma. You going to bed? Well, good night. See you later.
[96.54s -> 108.80s]  You're going to bed? We're about to watch television commercials from 1980 to 2000. You're going to bed?
[108.80s -> 115.30s]  All right. Probably got something to do. Whatever you're doing. Have a good night. It's five in the morning right now.
[115.30s -> 129.50s]  I don't know. Where could you be right now where it's five a.m.? We're like, Hawaii? Is Hawaii like, well, how far back is Hawaii from right now?
[129.50s -> 136.38s]  Asia? Would it be? No, it'd be earlier. It'd be like, wouldn't it be like one or two, two o'clock in the morning?
[136.38s -> 151.32s]  What time is it in Hawaii right now? Right now? Five a.m. in Australia.
[151.32s -> 161.35s]  Okay. This always confuses me. Isn't Australia is ahead of the United States, right?
[161.35s -> 174.66s]  It's technically it's like 14 or 15 hours ahead, not behind. So it's is it right now? Is it the seventh?
[174.66s -> 187.02s]  It's the seventh in Australia and New Zealand. Depends on your perspective. Five a.m. in Iceland. Yes. Okay.
[187.02s -> 197.32s]  So this is your perspective. So at what point you don't go backwards to go forwards, right?
[197.32s -> 203.32s]  Well, I guess you kind of do. What time is it right now in Asia like Japan, China?
[203.32s -> 210.76s]  Like, what time is it right now? And is it it's the sixth, right? Is it still the sixth?
[210.76s -> 220.14s]  Is it the fifth in Asia? No, it's six a.m. in Korea. Is there anywhere on Earth?
[220.14s -> 224.14s]  That's actually a pretty interesting thing to talk about. Is there a place?
[224.14s -> 229.14s]  Is there more than a few places on Earth where it's over the course of three days?
[229.14s -> 236.14s]  Like, is there a time period where it's the fifth in this place, the sixth in this place and the seventh in this place?
[236.14s -> 251.64s]  There's no magic kind of hour where that happens. Sorry. That fucking hurt.
[251.64s -> 262.56s]  Are you high? No. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. I looked over.
[262.56s -> 267.56s]  Look, I'm just like kind of getting here. I'm getting ready for the day, getting ready to the stream.
[267.56s -> 272.56s]  I'm talking about this. I look over at the mod chat and I've never seen this before.
[272.56s -> 275.74s]  So they're just kind of like, what is he talking about? What I saw?
[275.74s -> 280.74s]  VR Josh wrote ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[280.74s -> 285.74s]  I'm like at least eight or nine has I've never seen that over here.
[285.74s -> 293.56s]  That's never happened. It was like this is no.
[293.56s -> 297.56s]  Dr. Clay, what the fuck are you talking about? No one is three days ahead.
[297.56s -> 307.00s]  No, no, no, no. Let me listen. What I mean by that is, is there just let me explain for one second before it freaks out.
[307.00s -> 312.37s]  So right now, OK, four hours ago, five hours ago,
[312.37s -> 323.87s]  when it was eleven fifty nine p.m. in China, it is technically the fifth over there.
[323.87s -> 328.87s]  It is then about six or seven a.m. here, which is the sixth.
[328.87s -> 341.26s]  And Australia, it's the seventh right at eleven fifty nine p.m. in China.
[341.26s -> 346.69s]  I'm asking, is there a period where it's like the time zones go over a few days?
[346.69s -> 356.43s]  He's dumb. No, what the fuck? You idiot. Australia, the 24 hour cycle.
[356.43s -> 366.45s]  It's 24 hours. I know, but I'm saying in that 24 hour period, is it possible?
[366.45s -> 375.94s]  Dude, there aren't two sons. No, that's not what I'm saying.
[375.94s -> 380.94s]  I need to like write this down because I feel like you're all wrong. I feel like you're all wrong.
[380.94s -> 390.88s]  If I take a plane and travel the world, the entire globe and beat the time zones, is it still the day it was for me on the plane?
[390.88s -> 401.74s]  Precisely. Exactly. OK, everybody shut up.
[401.74s -> 411.65s]  We're watching commercials today. What are you saying? You're exploiting a glitch.
[411.65s -> 420.73s]  I need to like write this down. Eleven fifty nine p.m. in China is seven a.m.
[420.73s -> 427.67s]  in the United States, which is the next day in Australia.
[427.67s -> 439.71s]  Somebody help me here. Oh, excuse me. Thank you, scientists that came in and fixed this.
[439.71s -> 449.71s]  For the two hours between ten and eleven fifty nine UTC each day, three different days are observed at the same time in different places.
[449.71s -> 459.71s]  For example, at UTC time Thursday, ten fifteen, it is Wednesday, twenty three fifteen in American Samoa, UTC minus eleven,
[459.71s -> 472.71s]  and Friday, zero zero colon fifteen in Kiritimati, which is UTC plus fourteen for the first hour, UTC ten o'clock to dash ten colon fifty nine.
[472.71s -> 476.71s]  This is true for both inhabited and uninhabited territories.
[476.71s -> 485.71s]  But during the second hour, UTC eleven colon zero zero dash eleven fifty nine, it is only true in an uninhabited maritime time zone.
[485.71s -> 487.71s]  Twelve hours behind UTC, UTC minus twelve.
[487.71s -> 492.10s]  So there you go. You just got absolutely decimated.
[492.10s -> 501.53s]  I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I'm. I was right.
[501.53s -> 518.02s]  There was a scientist came in. No one cares. I do.
[518.02s -> 527.19s]  It would be funny. Yeah, somebody got it right.
[527.19s -> 530.01s]  That's a prank. No, it's over.
[530.01s -> 535.31s]  There are three observed days in one day in one small period.
[535.31s -> 537.68s]  Explain what you just read without reading it.
[539.62s -> 548.20s]  OK, so there are boats and I don't know as I'm right.
[548.20s -> 556.61s]  I'm right. All I know is that I'm right.
[556.61s -> 564.54s]  I have my reasoning when it's twelve when it's eleven fifty nine p.m. in China.
[564.54s -> 573.49s]  It is therefore colon eleven dash zero zero UTC four a.m.
[573.49s -> 577.52s]  You got it right here. Somebody has it as an image.
[577.52s -> 581.27s]  Look at this. Look at this shit. Look at this shit. You ready for this?
[581.27s -> 584.27s]  Oh, you guys are in trouble now. The overlapping time zones.
[584.27s -> 591.94s]  Here it comes. Hold on. Let me get this on screen.
[591.94s -> 600.43s]  Oops. OK, here we go. So here it is. Check this out.
[600.43s -> 604.43s]  I would like all the people that just unsubscribed and unfollowed
[604.43s -> 606.43s]  because this guy is such a moron.
[606.43s -> 608.43s]  There's no way he can't even tie his shoes every day.
[608.43s -> 631.86s]  I want you to look at this. What are the filters on this?
[631.86s -> 637.82s]  They look. Oh, excuse me. Oh, excuse me. What happened?
[637.82s -> 642.45s]  What's this? Oh, is this the overlapping time zones where that shows you
[642.45s -> 649.45s]  we have three. We observe three different days. Interesting. Interesting.
[649.45s -> 667.35s]  Explain that. This is the middle of the ocean next to Alaska.
[667.35s -> 673.58s]  There are three observable days. Thirteen.
[673.58s -> 683.95s]  Explain what a time zone is. Time is a no, it's not.
[683.95s -> 687.79s]  What? Address the Eminem, please.
[687.79s -> 690.79s]  The last image that was saved here and I just clicked it.
[690.79s -> 697.98s]  I thought I watched a video on this. Yeah, everyone's calling me crazy.
[697.98s -> 700.98s]  This is how it's actually this. There's more than two observable days.
[700.98s -> 704.98s]  And like for an hour a day in a very specific time period,
[704.98s -> 707.98s]  which is very much explained in this graph,
[707.98s -> 713.06s]  which if you can't understand what this means, I mean, I do.
[713.06s -> 718.42s]  So on the left side of the line, it could be 1201 a.m. on January 3rd.
[718.42s -> 721.42s]  It would be January 2nd on most of the earth.
[721.42s -> 726.42s]  But the right side of the line would still be about 1101 p.m. January 1st.
[726.42s -> 734.60s]  You guys ready to watch commercials?
[734.60s -> 744.28s]  Bro, just watch the commercials. There's so many people here that got like popcorn and drink.
[745.58s -> 748.58s]  Like they're sitting around like a bunch of people waiting.
[748.58s -> 757.27s]  And she's like, I don't want to, I don't want to do this.
[757.27s -> 762.09s]  Belly belt, that is unbelievably funny. I'm going to have to steal this.
[762.09s -> 771.68s]  I'm Tom Scott and I'm currently standing in the middle of the ocean during three simultaneous days.
[771.68s -> 777.91s]  Behind me is a big boat.
[777.91s -> 781.91s]  And that, that title, Tom Scott, that's a great video idea.
[781.91s -> 787.91s]  The title of that video is this video is over, like something about three days.
[787.91s -> 790.91s]  You know what I mean? Like it is three days long in this video.
[790.91s -> 797.80s]  Something, right? Like this video, it is three days on this video.
[797.80s -> 799.80s]  I don't know. He's so much smarter than I am. He'll be able to do it.
[799.80s -> 803.77s]  He would have a banger title for that too.
[803.77s -> 810.17s]  You know it would be super informative.
[810.17s -> 813.17s]  It would break everything down like incredibly well.
[813.17s -> 815.17s]  It would be so detailed. I would understand it so easily.
[815.17s -> 825.92s]  This video took three days to film. Yeah. Perfect.
[825.92s -> 828.72s]  Wow. Cool. All right. You guys ready?
[828.72s -> 830.72s]  We're going to watch commercials. We're going to watch infomercials.
[830.72s -> 831.72s]  We've done this before.
[831.72s -> 836.96s]  And it was confirmed that everybody told me that this was one of the best things I've ever done,
[836.96s -> 838.96s]  which is all right.
[838.96s -> 842.78s]  Like, hey, what's, what's the, what's your, hey, community.
[842.78s -> 848.21s]  What's the, your favorite thing I have ever done ever in the last 12 years?
[848.21s -> 850.70s]  The time that you watched infomercials on stream.
[850.70s -> 854.52s]  So, I mean, have to give the people what they want sometimes, right?
[854.52s -> 859.15s]  So here it is. These are, there's a collection.
[859.15s -> 863.46s]  And I didn't know this, but I mean, look at the title of this.
[863.46s -> 867.59s]  This is volume number 956.
[867.59s -> 870.60s]  There's a lot of these.
[870.60s -> 874.31s]  So, got some content for a little while, I think.
[874.31s -> 880.67s]  What are you saying?
[880.67s -> 883.94s]  You wish my wife a Merry Christmas.
[883.94s -> 885.94s]  Have a Merry Christmas.
[885.94s -> 890.10s]  All right. Just click, click, play.
[890.10s -> 893.04s]  No, I'm not ready.
[893.04s -> 897.20s]  I need to explain what's happening today.
[897.20s -> 899.20s]  Dude, did you pirate Elden Ring?
[899.20s -> 904.11s]  What? What are you talking about?
[904.11s -> 909.95s]  No, I've, I've bought it the day one.
[909.95s -> 911.95s]  I like I bought it two days.
[911.95s -> 915.22s]  What do you mean? Prove it.
[915.22s -> 921.23s]  I played it on Steam.
[921.23s -> 922.23s]  No, there's no wall penis.
[922.23s -> 923.23s]  I would show you.
[923.23s -> 929.58s]  Okay.
[929.58s -> 930.58s]  So here we go.
[930.58s -> 931.58s]  This is 80s commercials.
[931.58s -> 932.58s]  We're going to break these down.
[932.58s -> 933.58s]  I'm going to be frequently pausing.
[933.58s -> 937.39s]  Those of you that are just going to be pissed off with my pausing.
[937.39s -> 938.39s]  And we're going to begin.
[938.39s -> 939.39s]  Look, we had to spend a little bit.
[939.39s -> 945.22s]  We had to have people trickle in to hang out.
[945.22s -> 950.10s]  All right.
[950.10s -> 951.10s]  One more image and we'll go.
[951.10s -> 952.10s]  One more image.
[952.10s -> 953.10s]  This is pretty good, too.
[953.10s -> 954.10s]  We're going to wait for this people.
[954.10s -> 959.16s]  Everyone's like favorite stream ever.
[959.16s -> 961.16s]  Imagine if we didn't stall for like 15 minutes.
[961.16s -> 967.46s]  This is a good one, though.
[967.46s -> 971.83s]  Oh, shit.
[971.83s -> 972.83s]  What have I done?
[972.83s -> 974.01s]  No, I'm good.
[974.01s -> 978.77s]  Where is it?
[978.77s -> 980.46s]  There it is.
[980.46s -> 991.49s]  Green M&M.
[991.49s -> 992.49s]  Live here.
[992.49s -> 993.49s]  Sun up.
[993.49s -> 994.49s]  Auto.
[994.49s -> 995.49s]  Live here.
[995.49s -> 996.49s]  Sundown.
[996.49s -> 997.49s]  Live here.
[997.49s -> 1004.81s]  Midnight.
[1004.81s -> 1008.42s]  Boat.
[1008.42s -> 1009.42s]  Earth.
[1009.42s -> 1010.42s]  Some of you guys got really into that.
[1010.42s -> 1011.42s]  And I'm telling you, I was correct.
[1011.42s -> 1016.50s]  Auto.
[1016.50s -> 1019.59s]  Live here.
[1019.59s -> 1020.59s]  All right.
[1020.59s -> 1022.02s]  You guys ready?
[1022.02s -> 1023.02s]  It's time to watch some commercials.
[1024.26s -> 1027.85s]  Some of these are actually Christmas related.
[1027.85s -> 1030.85s]  So, I mean, a lot of ads happen on Christmas time.
[1030.85s -> 1032.86s]  And let's see.
[1032.86s -> 1034.86s]  I don't know what these are.
[1034.86s -> 1035.86s]  I have no idea.
[1035.86s -> 1036.86s]  I know as much as you do.
[1036.86s -> 1037.86s]  But I do.
[1037.86s -> 1038.86s]  I'm going to remember some of these, I think.
[1038.86s -> 1039.86s]  Maybe not the 80s ones, but the 90s ones.
[1039.86s -> 1043.10s]  Finally, time that person out for one second.
[1043.10s -> 1044.53s]  Ready?
[1044.53s -> 1046.09s]  Here we go.
[1046.09s -> 1048.48s]  Make sure you can hear it.
[1048.48s -> 1049.48s]  We'll do it.
[1049.48s -> 1050.66s]  It's ad.
[1050.66s -> 1055.54s]  It's just ad roulette.
[1055.54s -> 1061.54s]  Mr. T and Emanuel Lewis in a Christmas dream, sponsored in part by all your friends at
[1062.54s -> 1063.54s]  Okay.
[1075.96s -> 1080.82s]  Oh, his damage.
[1092.13s -> 1094.13s]  So they had damageable chests?
[1105.64s -> 1107.64s]  Good source of vitamin A.
[1107.64s -> 1108.64s]  That's important.
[1108.64s -> 1109.64s]  And another thing.
[1109.64s -> 1110.64s]  What?
[1110.64s -> 1111.64s]  It tastes good.
[1111.64s -> 1115.39s]  Ma'am, I'll have a bowl of that Campbell's soup, please.
[1115.39s -> 1116.39s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[1116.39s -> 1117.39s]  Wait a minute.
[1117.39s -> 1118.39s]  Wait a minute.
[1118.39s -> 1121.23s]  Wait a minute.
[1121.23s -> 1122.23s]  Wait a minute.
[1122.23s -> 1123.23s]  Are they eating Campbell's soup at a diner?
[1123.23s -> 1126.23s]  Why is the diner serving Campbell's soup?
[1126.23s -> 1133.50s]  So you go, they go into the restaurant and they order.
[1133.50s -> 1134.81s]  Oh, I'll have the soup, please.
[1134.81s -> 1139.81s]  And it's just they they dumped it into the into a big container.
[1139.81s -> 1141.43s]  Hold on.
[1141.43s -> 1142.80s]  Good for you.
[1142.80s -> 1143.80s]  Oh, it's good for you.
[1143.80s -> 1144.80s]  Lunch.
[1144.80s -> 1146.80s]  Oh, by the way, lunch of champions.
[1146.80s -> 1148.36s]  This is on the news.
[1148.36s -> 1149.36s]  This is all over the news.
[1149.36s -> 1151.36s]  It's literally all over the news.
[1152.79s -> 1154.79s]  That actually kind of looks gross.
[1155.79s -> 1157.79s]  Doesn't that kind of look like shit?
[1157.79s -> 1161.31s]  That's not like a good photo.
[1161.31s -> 1167.61s]  But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1167.61s -> 1171.61s]  That says Campbell's vegetable beef soup's a real good source of vitamin A.
[1171.61s -> 1172.61s]  That's important.
[1172.61s -> 1173.61s]  Okay.
[1173.61s -> 1174.61s]  And another thing.
[1174.61s -> 1175.61s]  What?
[1175.61s -> 1176.61s]  It tastes good.
[1176.61s -> 1177.61s]  Right?
[1177.61s -> 1179.61s]  Ma'am, I'll have a bowl of that Campbell's soup, please.
[1179.61s -> 1184.94s]  This look at all the cans.
[1188.61s -> 1193.68s]  Isn't the whole point of going to a restaurant that you wouldn't be served
[1193.68s -> 1196.68s]  Campbell's out of a can dumped into a container heated up?
[1196.68s -> 1204.87s]  I'm very confused by this one.
[1204.87s -> 1208.01s]  This is just a kitchen cabinet.
[1208.01s -> 1210.01s]  And let me I'm going to be very, very clear about this.
[1210.01s -> 1213.02s]  I Campbell's soup is great.
[1213.02s -> 1215.51s]  Campbell's soup, chicken noodle, tomato.
[1215.51s -> 1217.51s]  I grew up on this.
[1217.51s -> 1218.51s]  I love this stuff.
[1218.51s -> 1220.90s]  But this is weird.
[1220.90s -> 1226.41s]  This is very strange to say like, oh, yeah, we're at the diner.
[1226.41s -> 1227.41s]  Oh, don't you know?
[1227.41s -> 1229.41s]  By the way, I'm like some random like sheriff.
[1229.41s -> 1230.41s]  Oh, yeah.
[1230.41s -> 1231.41s]  Don't you know?
[1231.41s -> 1233.48s]  It's got vitamin A in it.
[1233.48s -> 1234.48s]  It's like, why?
[1234.48s -> 1236.48s]  Why are we talking right now?
[1236.48s -> 1241.02s]  Why are you telling me about this?
[1241.02s -> 1243.65s]  Eat carefully.
[1243.65s -> 1245.65s]  Eat carefully.
[1245.65s -> 1249.36s]  That was weird.
[1249.36s -> 1253.36s]  Here it comes to Diet Coke with 100% Nutri-Sweet.
[1253.36s -> 1255.36s]  A taste that's one of a kind.
[1256.36s -> 1257.36s]  Wait, this.
[1257.36s -> 1259.36s]  Why is there a jet?
[1266.68s -> 1271.99s]  These dances.
[1271.99s -> 1275.87s]  Oh, do you remember when America went to the moon?
[1275.87s -> 1280.82s]  That was a lot in that one.
[1280.82s -> 1283.86s]  Hold on.
[1283.86s -> 1287.93s]  The thing about soda commercials that I think is just so strange.
[1287.93s -> 1289.93s]  And I know chip commercials do stuff like this, too.
[1289.93s -> 1295.56s]  But it's like, who cares about any of this?
[1295.56s -> 1296.86s]  Right.
[1296.86s -> 1299.55s]  Just just drink the soda.
[1299.55s -> 1300.55s]  It's good.
[1300.55s -> 1304.50s]  Like you ever see the like the this is a completely different tangent.
[1304.50s -> 1311.67s]  But you see like the chip commercials where they have the it's like, oh, well, here's here's like a potato chip commercial.
[1311.67s -> 1315.04s]  And it's always a couple of celebrities.
[1315.04s -> 1318.04s]  And they're just they're way too obsessed with these bags.
[1318.04s -> 1320.04s]  They're way too obsessed with this shit.
[1320.04s -> 1323.73s]  They hold they hold it vertically.
[1323.73s -> 1328.72s]  They hold the bags vertically at the bottom like this.
[1328.72s -> 1332.90s]  They like they cup it like this and it stands straight up.
[1332.90s -> 1334.90s]  The bag always looks like it's made out of glass.
[1334.90s -> 1337.07s]  It's this weird tube.
[1337.07s -> 1338.82s]  It's like, look at these celebrities.
[1338.82s -> 1339.82s]  They eat chips.
[1339.82s -> 1342.09s]  So do I.
[1342.09s -> 1343.09s]  Who fucking cares?
[1343.09s -> 1344.09s]  So do I.
[1344.09s -> 1346.09s]  Who cares that celebrities eat chips?
[1346.09s -> 1347.09s]  Who cares?
[1347.09s -> 1348.39s]  I do, too.
[1348.39s -> 1349.57s]  You do.
[1349.57s -> 1351.57s]  It's not like a thing that we have to I don't get it.
[1351.57s -> 1354.57s]  It's the same kind of world with soda commercials.
[1354.57s -> 1356.74s]  People are like partying.
[1356.74s -> 1359.05s]  Everyone's having such a good time.
[1359.05s -> 1362.05s]  Look at where we went to space that time.
[1362.05s -> 1364.05s]  It's like just just drink the drink.
[1366.05s -> 1368.54s]  This is a lady taking a take.
[1368.54s -> 1369.54s]  What was she doing?
[1369.54s -> 1373.54s]  Was that like a waterfall taking like a waterfall shower?
[1373.54s -> 1376.54s]  What was that?
[1376.54s -> 1381.32s]  What does this have to do with drinking soda?
[1381.32s -> 1391.50s]  You know, it would be a much better commercial.
[1391.50s -> 1392.50s]  And I'm serious.
[1392.50s -> 1393.50s]  Get me on the marketing team.
[1393.50s -> 1395.99s]  Just do what everybody does.
[1395.99s -> 1399.75s]  This just have a guy.
[1399.75s -> 1400.75s]  You have a guy.
[1400.75s -> 1402.75s]  Girl, no matter sitting down on a couch.
[1402.75s -> 1405.12s]  It's just kind of dark in the room.
[1405.12s -> 1406.62s]  And have him just go like this.
[1406.62s -> 1429.26s]  This would be more realistic.
[1429.26s -> 1431.26s]  That would actually be a terrible commercial.
[1431.26s -> 1432.26s]  You know what I mean?
[1432.26s -> 1451.50s]  Just like the side air burp that everybody does.
[1451.50s -> 1455.50s]  The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television
[1455.50s -> 1459.50s]  is doing something better than what you're doing.
[1459.50s -> 1462.50s]  You ever see anyone on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa
[1462.50s -> 1464.50s]  with potato chip crumbs on their face?
[1464.50s -> 1466.50s]  Some people have a little too much fun on television.
[1466.50s -> 1468.50s]  The soda commercial people.
[1468.50s -> 1472.50s]  Where do they summon this enthusiasm?
[1472.50s -> 1473.50s]  Have you seen them?
[1473.50s -> 1474.50s]  We have soda.
[1474.50s -> 1475.50s]  We have soda.
[1475.50s -> 1476.50s]  We have soda.
[1476.50s -> 1480.50s]  Jumping, laughing, flying through the air.
[1480.50s -> 1484.13s]  It's a can of soda.
[1484.13s -> 1486.13s]  Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV
[1486.13s -> 1490.13s]  and you're drinking the exact product that they're advertising
[1490.13s -> 1492.13s]  right there on TV?
[1492.13s -> 1494.13s]  And it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,
[1494.13s -> 1497.13s]  jet skiing, girls in bikinis.
[1497.13s -> 1498.13s]  And I'm standing there.
[1499.13s -> 1502.54s]  He's right.
[1502.54s -> 1507.64s]  What, you can't have the same take?
[1507.64s -> 1514.17s]  I actually do like the...
[1514.17s -> 1518.94s]  Is that the American flag?
[1518.94s -> 1525.26s]  Dude, people slam sodas in commercials too, by the way.
[1525.26s -> 1526.26s]  Have you ever noticed that?
[1526.26s -> 1530.62s]  People go like slam, slam, slam, slam.
[1530.62s -> 1533.62s]  And you're telling me there's not going to be a real gross side burp after that?
[1533.62s -> 1536.70s]  They're full of shit.
[1551.14s -> 1556.14s]  What's that?
[1556.14s -> 1559.53s]  Why is Q-Bird in this?
[1559.53s -> 1563.94s]  Who's the weird Q-Bird guy?
[1584.12s -> 1588.12s]  Why would you have a hamburger under the tree?
[1588.12s -> 1590.12s]  This is a weird present.
[1590.12s -> 1594.12s]  And the hamburger looks upside down, but right side up at the same time.
[1594.12s -> 1597.82s]  I wouldn't put my food on the ground.
[1597.82s -> 1599.82s]  Can you imagine waking up on Christmas morning?
[1599.82s -> 1603.98s]  It's like, all right, what have we got under the...
[1603.98s -> 1604.98s]  Let's see what's happening.
[1604.98s -> 1608.05s]  Everyone's so exciting.
[1608.05s -> 1610.05s]  And it's like a Burger King or like a Hardee's or whatever.
[1610.05s -> 1613.05s]  It's on the ground in front of the tree.
[1613.05s -> 1616.36s]  I can understand a bag, right?
[1616.36s -> 1618.36s]  There's a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Hardee's.
[1618.36s -> 1623.14s]  I can understand a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Hardee's.
[1624.14s -> 1629.14s]  There's a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Burger King, but it on the ground?
[1629.14s -> 1635.01s]  I don't know about that.
[1637.01s -> 1640.01s]  By the way, I've never had Hardee's before, not once.
[1646.01s -> 1648.01s]  I've never eaten it before.
[1648.01s -> 1649.01s]  That's a lie. No, it's not.
[1649.01s -> 1651.01s]  I have never eaten Hardee's or Carl's Jr.
[1651.01s -> 1653.01s]  Never in my entire life.
[1657.01s -> 1661.01s]  It's mid.
[1661.01s -> 1662.01s]  I've never had it.
[1662.01s -> 1664.01s]  They just look huge.
[1664.01s -> 1667.01s]  Everything looks gigantic in Hardee's portions.
[1681.40s -> 1683.40s]  All right, I like this one.
[1683.40s -> 1687.40s]  This one's more realistic, but it's funny because the kid didn't get a single bit in his mouth.
[1688.40s -> 1691.40s]  You eat all that soup and maybe you'll be okay.
[1691.40s -> 1696.40s]  He picked it up a little too fast and it all dumped and he just, oh, shit, there's nothing there.
[1696.40s -> 1698.90s]  Wet and cold and hungry.
[1698.90s -> 1701.90s]  Very few things are more satisfying than a hot, very beautiful love.
[1701.90s -> 1702.90s]  That one's actually pretty good.
[1702.90s -> 1704.90s]  Campbell's tomato soup.
[1705.90s -> 1708.90s]  Do you still love me anymore?
[1708.90s -> 1710.90s]  Soup is good food.
[1710.90s -> 1712.90s]  What?
[1712.90s -> 1715.90s]  It's a world of celebration.
[1715.90s -> 1717.90s]  What?
[1717.90s -> 1719.90s]  What?
[1719.90s -> 1720.90s]  Hold on.
[1720.90s -> 1722.90s]  Why?
[1722.90s -> 1724.90s]  Do you still love me anymore?
[1724.90s -> 1727.65s]  Soup is good food.
[1727.65s -> 1729.65s]  That was strange.
[1731.72s -> 1739.77s]  It's a world of celebration.
[1739.77s -> 1741.77s]  Everybody said, she didn't say yes.
[1741.77s -> 1744.77s]  A hot, nourishing bowl of Campbell's tomato soup.
[1746.77s -> 1749.01s]  Do you still love me anymore?
[1749.01s -> 1753.87s]  Soup is good food.
[1753.87s -> 1755.87s]  God damn it.
[1759.12s -> 1784.18s]  Are they making it in their house?
[1784.18s -> 1786.18s]  That was in the same house.
[1786.18s -> 1789.13s]  They made it in the house.
[1789.13s -> 1796.04s]  You know what's awesome about these ad compilation videos?
[1796.04s -> 1800.04s]  You can tell what they taped.
[1800.04s -> 1802.04s]  This is what they taped.
[1802.04s -> 1807.04s]  You can see the intro and the outro of what show they were actually taping and cut out.
[1808.04s -> 1820.28s]  If you're looking at video cassette recorders and you're confused by all your choices,
[1820.28s -> 1823.28s]  just look at the most important feature of all.
[1823.28s -> 1825.28s]  The picture.
[1825.28s -> 1828.28s]  And Sony Betamax records a sharper picture than VHS.
[1828.28s -> 1830.28s]  That's not just my opinion.
[1830.28s -> 1836.28s]  In tests throughout the country, more people said the picture was sharper with Sony Betamax than VHS.
[1836.28s -> 1839.28s]  So why doesn't anyone else talk sharper pictures?
[1839.28s -> 1842.28s]  Because no one else can.
[1842.28s -> 1845.28s]  Betamax, a sharper picture.
[1845.28s -> 1847.28s]  What?
[1847.28s -> 1852.00s]  What happened with Betamax?
[1852.00s -> 1854.00s]  Betamax was supposed to be better than VHS.
[1854.00s -> 1860.23s]  And people just didn't care?
[1860.23s -> 1862.23s]  The guy in the commercial even says it.
[1862.23s -> 1865.23s]  He's like, how come more people aren't talking about Betamax?
[1865.23s -> 1867.23s]  Because we're better than them.
[1867.23s -> 1874.62s]  In tests throughout the country, more people said the picture was sharper with Sony Betamax than VHS.
[1874.62s -> 1877.62s]  So why doesn't anyone else talk sharper pictures?
[1877.62s -> 1879.62s]  Because no one else can.
[1879.62s -> 1881.62s]  Betamax, a sharper picture.
[1881.62s -> 1883.62s]  It was too expensive.
[1883.62s -> 1885.62s]  Oh, that's what killed it.
[1885.62s -> 1887.62s]  Jimmy Carter on the Cuban agreement. I love him.
[1887.62s -> 1890.62s]  Betamax was better, but it was not as cheap.
[1890.62s -> 1898.75s]  Interesting.
[1898.75s -> 1902.14s]  Get in class!
[1902.14s -> 1904.14s]  What the fuck are you kids doing in the hallway?
[1904.14s -> 1906.14s]  You can't control your feelings.
[1906.14s -> 1923.81s]  Get off the desk!
[1923.81s -> 1936.21s]  Food's not even...
[1936.21s -> 1938.21s]  Can you not eat in school?
[1938.21s -> 1953.82s]  Oh, there's after school.
[1953.82s -> 1964.26s]  Alright, I will say...
[1964.26s -> 1968.26s]  I would do something like this.
[1968.26s -> 1970.26s]  I would.
[1970.26s -> 1973.26s]  If I was hanging out with friends or something, we would like, well, come on in.
[1973.26s -> 1975.50s]  Go on there.
[1975.50s -> 1994.78s]  I would do that.
[1994.78s -> 1998.09s]  Looking out the window, like, Dad's out there with the big mower?
[1998.09s -> 2001.65s]  And he's just like, Dad, what are you doing out there?
[2001.65s -> 2003.65s]  He's so excited to cut the grass?
[2003.65s -> 2006.40s]  No, that's a tractor.
[2006.40s -> 2008.40s]  But still...
[2008.40s -> 2010.40s]  I guess you're just kind of vibing out.
[2010.40s -> 2015.90s]  But why the guy in the tractor?
[2015.90s -> 2019.81s]  The Cuban agreement. I love him.
[2019.81s -> 2021.81s]  Hanson, here we are.
[2021.81s -> 2023.81s]  We're at school.
[2023.81s -> 2025.81s]  School.
[2025.81s -> 2027.81s]  School.
[2027.81s -> 2033.12s]  School.
[2033.12s -> 2035.12s]  School.
[2037.12s -> 2040.19s]  School.
[2040.19s -> 2051.89s]  Way to school!
[2051.89s -> 2053.89s]  Where? Studying in school. Kids studying in school.
[2053.89s -> 2056.45s]  Oh, it's like after school. Guy in a tractor.
[2056.45s -> 2059.01s]  Why is this guy here?
[2059.01s -> 2061.01s]  School dance.
[2061.01s -> 2063.01s]  School.
[2063.01s -> 2065.31s]  In school.
[2065.31s -> 2068.45s]  After school.
[2068.45s -> 2070.45s]  We're coming out of school.
[2070.45s -> 2072.45s]  This isn't a school.
[2072.45s -> 2074.45s]  Where's the guy in the tractor?
[2076.45s -> 2082.78s]  How do they get McDonald's at school?
[2082.78s -> 2084.78s]  I don't know.
[2103.52s -> 2106.21s]  This is one of those products that
[2106.21s -> 2108.51s]  the parent that buys it doesn't read the box.
[2108.51s -> 2110.51s]  It doesn't see the commercial.
[2110.51s -> 2112.51s]  And realizes that it makes that kind of sound.
[2112.51s -> 2114.94s]  And then they go,
[2114.94s -> 2118.14s]  Well, this sucks because now I'm going to have to listen to this.
[2118.14s -> 2120.14s]  And then they just take the batteries out overnight one night
[2120.14s -> 2122.14s]  and then tell the kid,
[2122.14s -> 2124.14s]  Oh, it's broken.
[2124.14s -> 2126.14s]  And then the kid goes, What?
[2126.14s -> 2129.15s]  Oh! And then they just do it normally.
[2129.15s -> 2131.15s]  And they don't need the extra added echo.
[2131.15s -> 2133.15s]  Action figures each sold separately.
[2133.15s -> 2135.15s]  From Mattel.
[2135.15s -> 2137.15s]  Bottom of Tell.
[2137.15s -> 2139.15s]  Bottom of Tell.
[2139.15s -> 2144.21s]  More food dancing.
[2153.39s -> 2170.40s]  Milk.
[2170.40s -> 2172.40s]  I mean that was alright.
[2174.40s -> 2176.40s]  Somebody said
[2176.40s -> 2178.40s]  Milk is fucking gross.
[2178.40s -> 2180.40s]  What?
[2186.40s -> 2188.40s]  Hold on.
[2196.70s -> 2198.70s]  Why is everybody just
[2198.70s -> 2200.70s]  chugging milk?
[2200.70s -> 2210.16s]  Where are they?
[2210.16s -> 2212.16s]  The questions I have with commercials like this are where are they?
[2212.16s -> 2214.91s]  This is like Burger King,
[2214.91s -> 2217.15s]  McDonald's, a restaurant.
[2217.15s -> 2219.15s]  Everybody's just drinking
[2219.15s -> 2221.39s]  I guess
[2221.39s -> 2223.39s]  They're kids?
[2223.39s -> 2225.39s]  It's the local soda milk shop.
[2225.39s -> 2227.39s]  That's what they're going for.
[2227.39s -> 2229.39s]  This guy, you know, he's like
[2229.39s -> 2231.39s]  John Travolta in Grease.
[2241.10s -> 2243.10s]  Milk.
[2243.10s -> 2245.10s]  These two kids are hitting their heads.
[2253.10s -> 2255.10s]  Are we bubbling spa?
[2283.10s -> 2285.10s]  Oh!
[2285.10s -> 2287.10s]  Wait a minute.
[2289.10s -> 2291.10s]  That was actually a pretty good reveal.
[2294.62s -> 2296.62s]  The kid's like look I see him, look I see him.
[2296.62s -> 2298.62s]  He's like no, come on kid, give me a break.
[2298.62s -> 2300.86s]  The mom sees him.
[2303.49s -> 2305.73s]  That was a great ad.
[2305.73s -> 2309.38s]  That was a great ad. They did a great job.
[2309.38s -> 2311.38s]  That was very clean.
[2311.38s -> 2313.38s]  It was right to the point.
[2313.38s -> 2315.74s]  Fun little plot twist.
[2315.74s -> 2317.74s]  That's a good one.
[2317.74s -> 2319.74s]  I'm going to give it an A-.
[2331.74s -> 2333.74s]  That's the whole special.
[2339.74s -> 2351.63s]  Oh my god.
[2355.63s -> 2360.77s]  Getting so many intros and outros.
[2376.38s -> 2380.38s]  Bob Hope here telling you to make sure you drink as much milk as you can.
[2380.38s -> 2382.38s]  Not the 1% stuff, not the 2% stuff.
[2382.38s -> 2384.38s]  Of course folks are talking about the full fat whole milk.
[2386.38s -> 2388.38s]  Drink it as fast as you can.
[2393.01s -> 2395.01s]  Texaco.
[2397.01s -> 2399.01s]  Texaco.
[2409.01s -> 2411.01s]  Big oil.
[2411.01s -> 2432.50s]  Why is Bob Hope presenting Texaco like it's a new museum that he's cutting the tape to be able to go to the grand opening of a museum?
[2442.50s -> 2449.55s]  The logo is already here.
[2449.55s -> 2455.89s]  Why are we revealing this?
[2455.89s -> 2458.13s]  It's already on the sign.
[2465.33s -> 2467.33s]  It's just this gas station.
[2479.33s -> 2481.33s]  That's the first thing he asks.
[2492.40s -> 2497.54s]  Bob, that's the first thing you ask when the aliens land?
[2497.54s -> 2501.50s]  Regular or unleaded.
[2501.50s -> 2503.50s]  He should have screamed.
[2510.99s -> 2516.11s]  I don't think that's the reaction you have.
[2516.11s -> 2518.11s]  I mean if he screamed it would have been so funny.
[2518.11s -> 2525.41s]  If it sucked him up I think that would have been so funny.
[2525.41s -> 2531.12s]  Regular or super unleaded.
[2531.12s -> 2533.12s]  He meant if he was like, regular or super unleaded.
[2533.12s -> 2538.00s]  They sucked him up and took off.
[2538.00s -> 2547.01s]  And then at the Christmas special that he's at right now, he's not there and he shows up like 30 minutes late with the aliens.
[2547.01s -> 2552.02s]  And they come onto the set, they got like costumes, alien costumes, and they're wearing Texaco gear.
[2552.02s -> 2554.02s]  Like wow, even the aliens use it.
[2554.02s -> 2558.24s]  I probably missed an opportunity here.
[2564.72s -> 2566.72s]  I want to say it one more time.
[2568.72s -> 2571.54s]  Regular or super unleaded.
[2578.14s -> 2582.82s]  He didn't even yell it.
[2582.82s -> 2585.06s]  He would need to scream this.
[2585.06s -> 2590.37s]  He's not, they can't hear him.
[2590.37s -> 2595.50s]  Wait, but they said it's flashing empty?
[2595.50s -> 2597.50s]  They need gas.
[2599.50s -> 2603.15s]  Regular or super unleaded.
[2603.15s -> 2607.15s]  They stopped in the galaxy to pick up a little bit of fuel.
[2607.15s -> 2612.53s]  Texaco history.
[2612.53s -> 2614.53s]  Texaco system 2000.
[2614.53s -> 2620.30s]  They run on gas.
[2620.30s -> 2625.10s]  Regular or super unleaded.
[2625.10s -> 2629.10s]  Texaco captures a golden era for women.
[2629.10s -> 2631.10s]  It's because the sign was so big.
[2631.10s -> 2637.34s]  A rich rich weaving of opulent texture.
[2637.34s -> 2641.34s]  An interlocking of elegance and style.
[2641.34s -> 2643.34s]  Of Rolex?
[2643.34s -> 2645.34s]  And the brilliant touch only a diamond can give.
[2645.34s -> 2649.34s]  At Seiko, great technology inspires great design.
[2649.34s -> 2653.34s]  Seiko setting the standard for the world, for the future.
[2653.34s -> 2659.52s]  Something about old commercials with the voiceover guy that had almost the bia voice.
[2659.52s -> 2661.52s]  They always talked like this.
[2661.52s -> 2667.82s]  The Seiko watch will finally get.
[2667.82s -> 2673.82s]  It was so low that it was almost unbelievable how low this person is talking in these old commercials.
[2673.82s -> 2675.82s]  Technology inspires great design.
[2675.82s -> 2677.82s]  Inspire is great.
[2677.82s -> 2681.82s]  I don't think humans can do this anymore.
[2681.82s -> 2685.82s]  Seiko setting the standard for the world, for the future.
[2685.82s -> 2687.82s]  I can't do it.
[2687.82s -> 2691.09s]  Now Seiko gives you the moon.
[2691.09s -> 2693.09s]  Oh, it's all the same guy.
[2693.09s -> 2697.09s]  Of the world's first analog quartz chronograph.
[2697.09s -> 2701.09s]  And tailors gray with dashes of gold tones.
[2701.09s -> 2705.09s]  To an elegant dress circle.
[2705.09s -> 2707.09s]  Seiko adds a date window.
[2707.09s -> 2711.09s]  And creates a bold alarm chronograph to sport everywhere.
[2711.09s -> 2715.09s]  At Seiko, great technology inspires great design.
[2715.09s -> 2719.09s]  Seiko setting the standard for the world, for the future.
[2719.09s -> 2721.09s]  I don't know.
[2734.74s -> 2736.74s]  Bro, that's a lot of fire near that tree.
[2736.74s -> 2742.43s]  To be a part of your holiday weekend.
[2742.43s -> 2753.39s]  Lots of motor royals talk protection and mileage.
[2753.39s -> 2755.39s]  I want proof.
[2755.39s -> 2759.39s]  New York taxis drove over a quarter million punishing miles with no oil related failures.
[2759.39s -> 2761.39s]  That's Havilland Supreme protection.
[2761.39s -> 2763.39s]  Not bad, but.
[2763.39s -> 2767.39s]  Proof, after a million miles of state trooper driving no oil related failures.
[2767.39s -> 2769.39s]  That's Havilland Supreme protection.
[2769.39s -> 2770.39s]  No kidding.
[2770.39s -> 2774.39s]  Proof, in fuel economy tests it delivered improved mileage.
[2774.39s -> 2775.39s]  I'm still skeptical.
[2775.39s -> 2777.39s]  Texaco Havilland Supreme.
[2777.39s -> 2779.39s]  They've got the proof.
[2779.39s -> 2781.82s]  Monday, it's an all new Little House movie.
[2781.82s -> 2783.82s]  A two hour Christmas special.
[2783.82s -> 2785.82s]  With the holiday spring tragedy when Laura's baby is kidnapped.
[2785.82s -> 2787.82s]  Why did you leave her?
[2787.82s -> 2790.19s]  Bless all the dear children, Monday.
[2791.19s -> 2793.19s]  Holy shit, what?
[2798.19s -> 2800.19s]  He seemed really annoyed there.
[2800.19s -> 2802.19s]  He got proven wrong.
[2816.19s -> 2818.19s]  Dude, that's not the problem.
[2820.19s -> 2822.19s]  Isn't that Werner Lutz?
[2822.19s -> 2824.19s]  We went to high school together.
[2824.19s -> 2826.19s]  By golly, you're right. I thought Werner was dead.
[2826.19s -> 2830.37s]  Texaco's super unleaded superstar power for more car power.
[2830.37s -> 2832.37s]  Hi, Bob doing yourself hope here.
[2832.37s -> 2841.20s]  And after the aliens, I'm a completely different man.
[2841.20s -> 2847.86s]  I was going to say something about this.
[2847.86s -> 2849.86s]  Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2849.86s -> 2851.86s]  Okay, so here's the interesting thing about this.
[2851.86s -> 2857.23s]  It doesn't matter how much gas is in your car or what kind of gas is in your car.
[2857.23s -> 2863.23s]  If you press like a quarter of a pound of pressure on your on your gas pedal,
[2863.23s -> 2865.54s]  you're going to go three miles per hour.
[2869.63s -> 2874.38s]  You could have zero gas in your tank.
[2874.38s -> 2876.38s]  I mean, like a sneeze of it.
[2876.38s -> 2878.62s]  Just enough to get into the intake, right?
[2878.62s -> 2880.93s]  And floor it.
[2880.93s -> 2882.93s]  And you'd go.
[2882.93s -> 2884.93s]  And you'd I mean, you'd go fucking 100 miles.
[2884.93s -> 2887.30s]  You'd go fast.
[2887.30s -> 2893.25s]  And then you mean you'd stall out eventually.
[2893.25s -> 2897.79s]  That's really bad for the engine.
[2897.79s -> 2899.79s]  You're right. I thought Werner.
[2899.79s -> 2901.79s]  I'm not saying to do that.
[2901.79s -> 2903.79s]  I'm just saying this doesn't make any sense.
[2903.79s -> 2905.79s]  He's not even pressing the gas.
[2905.79s -> 2907.79s]  Texaco's super unleaded superstar.
[2907.79s -> 2909.79s]  Is it implied that he's flooring it?
[2909.79s -> 2911.79s]  And his gas is proof.
[2911.79s -> 2915.25s]  There's no proof.
[2915.25s -> 2917.25s]  Power for more car power.
[2917.25s -> 2921.25s]  Hi, Bob doing yourself hope here for Havilland supreme motor oil.
[2921.25s -> 2925.25s]  Texaco's formula with its nine additives gives proven engine protection
[2925.25s -> 2927.25s]  for air rust and corrosion.
[2927.25s -> 2931.25s]  And Havilland's friction fighter reduces engine friction to help save gasoline in your car.
[2931.25s -> 2933.25s]  Next time you change oil,
[2933.25s -> 2937.25s]  get the motor oil that gives you proven engine protection.
[2937.25s -> 2942.69s]  And check this out.
[2942.69s -> 2945.95s]  He blows a fireball.
[2945.95s -> 2947.95s]  Save gasoline.
[2947.95s -> 2950.58s]  Havilland supreme.
[2950.58s -> 2955.95s]  What happened to the car?
[2957.95s -> 2959.95s]  Stay tuned for more of Bob Hope's Jolly Christmas Hour.
[2959.95s -> 2961.95s]  Right after this station break.
[2964.32s -> 2966.32s]  The NBA team.
[2966.32s -> 2968.32s]  Who's got the guts to grab Mr. T's gold and chain him to Murdock.
[2968.32s -> 2970.32s]  By taking downtown Tokyo away from Godzilla.
[2970.32s -> 2972.32s]  And on Reptide, Murray the powerful.
[2972.32s -> 2974.32s]  Murray the ruthless.
[2974.32s -> 2976.32s]  Murray the media star.
[2976.32s -> 2978.32s]  I think we created a monster.
[2978.32s -> 2982.32s]  And on Remington Steel, one of these masterful mystery writers has murder in mind for Laura and Steel.
[2982.32s -> 2984.32s]  What just happened?
[2984.32s -> 2986.32s]  When a neighborhood starts to die,
[2986.32s -> 2988.32s]  it seems there's nothing anyone can do to save it.
[2988.32s -> 2990.32s]  Did she just fly into him?
[2990.32s -> 2992.32s]  Riding in...
[2992.32s -> 2994.32s]  A wheelchair?
[2994.32s -> 2996.32s]  And they explode.
[2996.32s -> 2998.32s]  Why do they explode?
[3000.32s -> 3002.32s]  Why?
[3004.32s -> 3006.32s]  I want the context of what happened.
[3006.32s -> 3008.32s]  But that's not true.
[3008.32s -> 3010.32s]  With enough caring, a neighborhood can live.
[3010.32s -> 3012.32s]  Citibank knows it.
[3012.32s -> 3014.32s]  And Citibank knows it takes a lot of people
[3014.32s -> 3016.32s]  and a lot of hard work.
[3016.32s -> 3018.32s]  For over 15 years, we've helped restore
[3018.32s -> 3020.32s]  communities throughout the New York area.
[3020.32s -> 3022.32s]  We provide more money for more housing
[3022.32s -> 3024.32s]  than any other bank in New York.
[3024.32s -> 3026.32s]  We have a commitment to this city.
[3026.32s -> 3028.32s]  After all, it's our city too.
[3028.32s -> 3030.32s]  It's your Citibank.
[3032.50s -> 3034.50s]  Metro North. Drills for disaster.
[3034.50s -> 3036.50s]  Story at 11.
[3038.50s -> 3040.50s]  Oh, we're back to Bob Hope's.
[3040.50s -> 3042.50s]  Oh, home of holiday Christmas hour.
[3042.50s -> 3044.67s]  No, no we're not.
[3044.67s -> 3046.67s]  Bob, he's a pro.
[3046.67s -> 3048.67s]  I can't beat him.
[3048.67s -> 3050.67s]  He's driving on regular unleaded, but you've got
[3050.67s -> 3052.67s]  Texaco Super unleaded.
[3052.67s -> 3054.67s]  Whoa!
[3054.67s -> 3056.67s]  An identical turbo car
[3056.67s -> 3058.67s]  and can boost power.
[3058.67s -> 3061.68s]  These people are not in a race.
[3061.68s -> 3064.69s]  Are they? What is Bob doing here?
[3069.89s -> 3071.89s]  It does look like Trump.
[3077.71s -> 3080.78s]  Bob, he's a pro.
[3080.78s -> 3082.78s]  I can't do it.
[3082.78s -> 3086.18s]  I can't do it.
[3086.18s -> 3090.40s]  That's Donald Trump right there.
[3090.40s -> 3092.40s]  That's Donald Trump.
[3092.40s -> 3094.40s]  Okay.
[3094.40s -> 3096.70s]  If you said Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars
[3096.70s -> 3099.01s]  if you tell me who this person is.
[3099.01s -> 3101.01s]  I'll give you a million dollars in cash
[3101.01s -> 3103.01s]  and a handful of briefcases.
[3103.01s -> 3105.18s]  Who is this guy on camera right now?
[3105.18s -> 3108.70s]  That is Donald Trump.
[3108.70s -> 3114.21s]  And I would bet my life on it.
[3116.51s -> 3118.94s]  I fixed the race.
[3118.94s -> 3120.94s]  He's driving on
[3120.94s -> 3122.94s]  regular unleaded fuel.
[3122.94s -> 3125.18s]  I have super unleaded.
[3125.18s -> 3127.79s]  By the way, aliens?
[3127.79s -> 3129.79s]  Super cool. They're super funny.
[3129.79s -> 3132.03s]  They're super sweet. I learned a lot from them.
[3132.03s -> 3134.03s]  Regular unleaded, but you've got Texaco
[3134.03s -> 3136.03s]  Super unleaded.
[3136.03s -> 3138.03s]  You know what's crazy? All the weird
[3138.03s -> 3140.03s]  commercials Donald Trump used to do,
[3140.03s -> 3142.03s]  I would not be surprised if
[3142.03s -> 3144.98s]  he was here just doing that.
[3144.98s -> 3146.98s]  Even against a pro
[3146.98s -> 3148.98s]  in an identical turbo car,
[3148.98s -> 3150.98s]  it can boost power, improving acceleration
[3150.98s -> 3152.98s]  up steep roads almost 12 percent.
[3152.98s -> 3154.98s]  I won, I won.
[3154.98s -> 3156.98s]  When you need more octane superstar power
[3156.98s -> 3158.98s]  gives you more car power.
[3158.98s -> 3160.98s]  Next time you get the Texaco Super.
[3160.98s -> 3162.98s]  Why does he have one of these
[3162.98s -> 3167.78s]  in his trunk? This is not a
[3167.78s -> 3169.78s]  gas station. This is implied that he carries
[3169.78s -> 3171.78s]  this around with him. He just has
[3171.78s -> 3173.95s]  a gas pump?
[3173.95s -> 3176.51s]  This is not a station.
[3176.51s -> 3180.74s]  I won, I won.
[3180.74s -> 3186.03s]  And then he goes
[3186.03s -> 3188.03s]  blows into the fireball. It's his
[3188.03s -> 3191.81s]  thing he does in these.
[3191.81s -> 3193.81s]  Behind the new Texaco star.
[3193.81s -> 3196.50s]  There's a new Texaco.
[3196.50s -> 3198.74s]  LaSalle Seiko.
[3198.74s -> 3200.74s]  Superb design.
[3200.74s -> 3202.74s]  Responding to the challenge of the
[3202.74s -> 3204.74s]  highest quartz technology.
[3204.74s -> 3207.42s]  LaSalle Seiko.
[3207.42s -> 3209.42s]  Thinness at times
[3209.42s -> 3211.42s]  almost two dimensional.
[3211.42s -> 3213.42s]  Form that reaches for perfection.
[3213.42s -> 3215.42s]  And now LaSalle Seiko
[3215.42s -> 3217.42s]  gold in the preeminent 14
[3217.42s -> 3219.42s]  karat timepiece of this decade.
[3219.42s -> 3221.60s]  LaSalle Seiko.
[3221.60s -> 3223.60s]  Among the world's great possessions.
[3223.60s -> 3225.60s]  I'm not a watch guy.
[3225.60s -> 3228.74s]  I feel like I'd be super aware of it all the
[3228.74s -> 3232.45s]  time. Like it would, it would
[3232.45s -> 3234.45s]  you know if I'm wearing a long sleeve it like pops
[3234.45s -> 3238.80s]  out and yeah. I don't know. I feel like
[3238.80s -> 3240.80s]  I'd be so aware of it. Oh yeah that's that.
[3240.80s -> 3243.23s]  I have that on. And let me
[3243.23s -> 3247.65s]  show it to you. I mean I'm not against
[3247.65s -> 3249.89s]  you know this is like oh are you against
[3249.89s -> 3251.89s]  jewelry or are you against accessories?
[3251.89s -> 3254.58s]  No, no not necessarily.
[3254.58s -> 3256.58s]  But like you know if you have like a regular watch
[3256.58s -> 3258.58s]  it's like oh this thing is a watch it tells time or
[3258.58s -> 3261.33s]  something right? But I don't know I feel like I would be
[3261.33s -> 3263.33s]  always under pressure to show people
[3263.33s -> 3265.33s]  that I'm wearing one of these watches.
[3265.33s -> 3269.47s]  If it's on it's almost like
[3269.47s -> 3271.78s]  you're wearing it and it's this big
[3271.78s -> 3273.78s]  gold beautiful how much does it cost? It's expensive
[3273.78s -> 3275.78s]  and it's beautiful and it's class
[3275.78s -> 3278.72s]  right? I feel like you don't I don't
[3278.72s -> 3280.72s]  know I feel like you would be constantly going
[3280.72s -> 3288.14s]  and then the cashier at the grocery
[3288.14s -> 3292.11s]  store is just like okay
[3292.11s -> 3294.11s]  that'll be um that'll be
[3294.11s -> 3296.11s]  $49. You know what I mean?
[3296.11s -> 3298.11s]  I feel like I'd be constantly under pressure.
[3298.11s -> 3300.35s]  I don't want to be like I don't want to be under pressure.
[3300.35s -> 3304.90s]  You eat smoke for 12
[3304.90s -> 3307.84s]  hours. What?
[3307.84s -> 3309.84s]  So hot you feel like you're working inside a
[3309.84s -> 3311.84s]  furnace. Yeah you get a
[3311.84s -> 3313.84s]  headache. Oh okay.
[3313.84s -> 3316.21s]  You want something strong.
[3316.21s -> 3318.21s]  Anisyn. Anisyn.
[3318.21s -> 3320.21s]  23% more medicine. I thought he was telling
[3320.21s -> 3322.21s]  us like this is a crazy fact
[3322.21s -> 3324.82s]  that you need to know. What a wild
[3324.82s -> 3326.82s]  fact. You like eat smoke
[3326.82s -> 3328.82s]  all day. That's what I thought it was. Inside
[3328.82s -> 3330.82s]  a furnace.
[3330.82s -> 3334.53s]  You eat smoke
[3334.53s -> 3338.18s]  for 12 hours. So
[3338.18s -> 3340.18s]  hot you feel like you're working inside a furnace.
[3340.18s -> 3342.18s]  Yeah you get a headache.
[3342.18s -> 3344.93s]  You want something strong.
[3344.93s -> 3347.42s]  Anisyn. Anisyn.
[3347.42s -> 3349.42s]  23% more medicine
[3349.42s -> 3351.42s]  than regular pain relievers. Anisyn's
[3351.42s -> 3354.05s]  I thought that was a snickers bar.
[3354.05s -> 3360.75s]  stops pain fast.
[3360.75s -> 3363.06s]  Headache's gone and no stomach
[3363.06s -> 3365.62s]  upset. That really
[3365.62s -> 3368.30s]  takes the heat off. Anisyn
[3368.30s -> 3370.30s]  more medicine.
[3370.30s -> 3372.30s]  Take a close look at a new small
[3372.30s -> 3374.30s]  car from today.
[3374.30s -> 3376.30s]  I'm going to give that commercial an A-.
[3376.30s -> 3378.74s]  This is an A- because it was super
[3378.74s -> 3382.43s]  to the point. It's just hey
[3382.43s -> 3384.43s]  headaches suck. And you know if
[3384.43s -> 3386.43s]  I'm working and I got a headache I got something
[3386.43s -> 3388.93s]  I need something. This is an A- for me.
[3388.93s -> 3391.23s]  Headache's gone and no stomach upset.
[3391.23s -> 3393.92s]  That really
[3393.92s -> 3396.22s]  takes the heat off. Anisyn
[3396.22s -> 3398.22s]  more medicine. That's not Bob Hope.
[3398.22s -> 3400.22s]  Take a close look at a new
[3400.22s -> 3402.22s]  small car. That's not Bob. If it was Bob Hope
[3402.22s -> 3404.46s]  he would have been saying
[3404.46s -> 3406.77s]  something along the lines of this.
[3406.77s -> 3408.77s]  The thing about it is headaches
[3408.77s -> 3410.94s]  are really really tough. But you know it's
[3410.94s -> 3412.94s]  not a headache and he steps out of the way and there's a
[3412.94s -> 3415.89s]  Texaco gas pump behind him.
[3415.89s -> 3419.02s]  Fill it up with super unleaded. Texaco
[3419.02s -> 3421.02s]  gas is cleaner. He would step out of the
[3421.02s -> 3423.02s]  way and it would not be a headache commercial anymore.
[3423.02s -> 3427.25s]  From today's Chevrolet
[3427.25s -> 3429.25s]  new Spectrum.
[3429.25s -> 3431.25s]  In Spectrum you discover both sporty performance
[3431.25s -> 3433.25s]  and everyday economy. The performance
[3433.25s -> 3435.25s]  comes from 5 speed overhead cam
[3435.25s -> 3437.25s]  drills that boast a test track time of
[3437.25s -> 3439.25s]  0-50 in 8.2 seconds.
[3439.25s -> 3441.25s]  Spectrum economy. Uh oh.
[3441.25s -> 3443.42s]  The performance comes from
[3443.42s -> 3445.42s]  5 speed overhead cam drills
[3445.42s -> 3448.05s]  that boast a test track time of
[3448.05s -> 3450.05s]  unleaded fuel only.
[3450.05s -> 3454.40s]  Not super unleaded
[3454.40s -> 3461.87s]  fuel. Uh oh.
[3461.87s -> 3463.87s]  0-50 in 8.2 seconds.
[3463.87s -> 3465.87s]  Spectrum's economy comes from
[3465.87s -> 3467.87s]  the highest gas mileage of any sedan in America.
[3467.87s -> 3469.87s]  Discover new Spectrum.
[3469.87s -> 3471.87s]  The sporty car of our everyday driving.
[3473.87s -> 3475.87s]  That's not how it works.
[3478.50s -> 3494.18s]  Play a game if you guys want
[3494.18s -> 3496.18s]  where we watch the first 5 seconds
[3496.18s -> 3498.18s]  and if the product's not there we have to guess what the product
[3498.18s -> 3500.18s]  will be. I like that. That's
[3500.18s -> 3503.63s]  fun too. Again, that's a lot of candles.
[3509.63s -> 3511.63s]  I've seen this one.
[3511.63s -> 3513.63s]  May they be the warmest ever.
[3513.63s -> 3515.63s]  We'll do that on the next one.
[3528.58s -> 3530.58s]  Hold on a second. Let me blind this
[3530.58s -> 3532.58s]  pilot for a few seconds.
[3542.58s -> 3544.58s]  Wait a minute.
[3546.58s -> 3548.58s]  The UFO is coming.
[3548.58s -> 3550.88s]  It's right here.
[3550.88s -> 3555.66s]  He made a pact with the aliens.
[3555.66s -> 3558.10s]  Did you see that?
[3566.19s -> 3568.19s]  He's signaling to the aliens.
[3578.19s -> 3580.19s]  Okay.
[3585.01s -> 3588.96s]  If we were playing the game
[3588.96s -> 3590.96s]  to pause after one second.
[3592.96s -> 3594.96s]  I would have said it was for cheese.
[3594.96s -> 3596.96s]  I would have said it was a cheese commercial.
[3596.96s -> 3599.90s]  But that's not what this is.
[3599.90s -> 3601.90s]  This is...
[3601.90s -> 3603.90s]  I was going to go all in
[3603.90s -> 3605.90s]  for a cheese commercial.
[3611.90s -> 3613.90s]  Or a cough drop, yep.
[3635.54s -> 3637.54s]  You bet your ass we're missing out on some
[3637.54s -> 3640.29s]  prime quality video
[3640.29s -> 3642.72s]  content because
[3642.72s -> 3644.72s]  you know for a fact
[3644.72s -> 3647.02s]  there's going to be at least a dozen
[3647.02s -> 3649.02s]  product tie-ins with Texaco on that special.
[3664.83s -> 3666.83s]  Sound of Music is amazing. I mean you're talking about one of the most
[3666.83s -> 3668.83s]  classic pieces of media ever
[3668.83s -> 3670.83s]  produced.
[3672.83s -> 3674.83s]  There's no penis on the wall.
[3676.83s -> 3678.83s]  I think that's it for this one.
[3686.13s -> 3689.39s]  We're going to move on to the next one.
[3689.39s -> 3691.39s]  This was a good one. That was quality.
[3691.39s -> 3699.52s]  What is on the wall?
[3699.52s -> 3702.59s]  There is currently nothing on the wall.
[3702.59s -> 3705.22s]  I promise. I would show it if there was.
[3705.22s -> 3707.78s]  Alright, so that's that one. Pretty cool.
[3707.78s -> 3713.02s]  That was 80s commercials.
[3713.02s -> 3715.02s]  I'm so sorry. I gotta
[3715.02s -> 3717.02s]  stop that. I'm trying to make a point
[3717.02s -> 3719.02s]  as to what people do to go back
[3719.02s -> 3721.02s]  because everyone was like, that joke was bad. But like it wasn't though.
[3721.02s -> 3723.63s]  Alright, so
[3723.63s -> 3726.06s]  This one
[3726.06s -> 3731.06s]  Do I want to do 80s? Okay, let's play
[3731.06s -> 3734.32s]  the game. Let's play the game
[3734.32s -> 3736.94s]  of
[3736.94s -> 3738.94s]  Should I do 2 seconds or 3 seconds?
[3738.94s -> 3741.63s]  Do 90s?
[3741.63s -> 3743.63s]  I mean, I'll do it. I'm going to do this
[3743.63s -> 3746.45s]  a lot. Just the whole time. Do a 90s
[3746.45s -> 3750.61s]  one? Alright, let me get a 90s one.
[3750.61s -> 3756.50s]  We'll do a 90s one. Alright, 90s.
[3756.50s -> 3758.86s]  This is 90s
[3758.86s -> 3760.86s]  commercials, volume 410.
[3760.86s -> 3768.21s]  Here we go. Oh, we're going to do it.
[3768.21s -> 3770.21s]  Right? This one's kind of cheating
[3770.21s -> 3772.21s]  because this is when I grew up.
[3772.21s -> 3774.51s]  This is when I was younger.
[3774.51s -> 3776.51s]  So, I'm going to know a lot of these probably.
[3776.51s -> 3778.88s]  We'll see. Let's play it. 2 seconds
[3778.88s -> 3785.73s]  or 3 seconds? 3? Okay.
[3785.73s -> 3787.73s]  Here we go.
[3787.73s -> 3790.35s]  What a show.
[3790.35s -> 3793.42s]  This program is
[3793.42s -> 3795.42s]  brought to you by Barks, the one
[3795.42s -> 3797.42s]  with bite. It's going to be Barks Root Beer.
[3797.42s -> 3799.79s]  I think we already know that.
[3799.79s -> 3801.97s]  I'm going to put
[3801.97s -> 3803.97s]  my bet on Barks Root Beer incoming.
[3803.97s -> 3812.35s]  Okay? You guys
[3812.35s -> 3814.91s]  making your bets here? Barks
[3814.91s -> 3819.20s]  Root Beer. Let's see.
[3827.20s -> 3829.20s]  What the hell was that? What happened?
[3829.20s -> 3831.20s]  Why did they just kick that guy?
[3839.20s -> 3841.20s]  Oh, it's temporary tattoos.
[3843.20s -> 3845.70s]  Dude, that was such a trope
[3845.70s -> 3847.70s]  in the 90s. The old lady
[3847.70s -> 3850.32s]  that's sitting there
[3850.32s -> 3852.32s]  leaning into the camera saying
[3852.32s -> 3854.75s]  no, no, no. Every gum commercial,
[3854.75s -> 3856.93s]  every
[3856.93s -> 3858.93s]  soda commercial, everything
[3858.93s -> 3860.93s]  that was geared towards the younger
[3860.93s -> 3862.93s]  audience, grandma was
[3862.93s -> 3864.93s]  telling you, you can't
[3864.93s -> 3867.36s]  have that. No, this is
[3867.36s -> 3869.36s]  for grandma. No, it's not.
[3869.36s -> 3871.73s]  No, it's not.
[3871.73s -> 3873.73s]  It's for me.
[3876.54s -> 3878.54s]  Barks Root Beer, the one with
[3878.54s -> 3882.96s]  bark 2s.
[3882.96s -> 3885.58s]  Okay, this is obviously for a CD player
[3885.58s -> 3887.58s]  or a, I got to get it right though.
[3887.58s -> 3890.27s]  Was that a tape? This is 90s.
[3890.27s -> 3892.96s]  Is that a tape player or a CD player?
[3892.96s -> 3898.38s]  When in the 90s though?
[3898.38s -> 3903.18s]  I'm going to say that's a CD player. I don't know
[3903.18s -> 3905.18s]  what company though, but let's see.
[3905.18s -> 3907.42s]  It's a CD player.
[3907.42s -> 3917.92s]  Okay, I swear
[3917.92s -> 3919.92s]  this is a real memory. I hope, I don't think
[3919.92s -> 3921.92s]  I'm making this up, but I feel like I
[3921.92s -> 3924.16s]  actually did this. These are the CD players
[3924.16s -> 3927.04s]  that didn't skip because
[3927.04s -> 3929.04s]  back in the day
[3929.04s -> 3931.34s]  when you had a CD player, it
[3931.34s -> 3933.34s]  was feeding you the music
[3933.34s -> 3935.34s]  in very real time, almost like a record
[3935.34s -> 3937.84s]  player. And if you moved
[3937.84s -> 3939.84s]  and I'm talking even touched it,
[3939.84s -> 3942.46s]  it would go,
[3942.46s -> 3944.46s]  and skip, skip, skip, skip, skip in your ears.
[3944.46s -> 3946.46s]  You couldn't touch it because it was reading it in real
[3946.46s -> 3948.46s]  time. They came out with this
[3948.46s -> 3950.96s]  technology where it was no
[3950.96s -> 3953.33s]  CD skipping. And what I imagined
[3953.33s -> 3955.33s]  it did is it like took
[3955.33s -> 3957.33s]  the audio, buffered it, and
[3957.33s -> 3959.33s]  then put it up to you, right? Like about
[3959.33s -> 3962.27s]  maybe like four or five seconds. And I remember
[3962.27s -> 3964.27s]  people, it was such a huge jump
[3964.27s -> 3966.27s]  in the music world
[3966.27s -> 3968.27s]  that I remember people would take those and be
[3968.27s -> 3970.27s]  like, hey yeah, look at this.
[3970.27s -> 3972.90s]  See? Put your, put the headphones
[3972.90s -> 3974.90s]  in, see you, you're not skipping, right?
[3974.90s -> 3976.90s]  Not skipping, and like they'd break
[3976.90s -> 3978.90s]  them because they were trying to prove a point. And I
[3978.90s -> 3980.90s]  feel like I did that to one of, one that I had.
[3980.90s -> 3984.16s]  Like I had this weird memory
[3984.16s -> 3986.16s]  of me doing that, being like, look, see?
[3986.16s -> 3988.16s]  Smack! Smack! And it not
[3988.16s -> 3990.16s]  skipping, and then the thing kind of sounded
[3990.16s -> 3992.16s]  like shit for the next like ten times I used
[3992.16s -> 3995.62s]  it, and I stopped using it. So so many people
[3995.62s -> 3997.62s]  were so obsessed with proving to
[3997.62s -> 3999.62s]  you that it would work
[3999.62s -> 4004.10s]  that they made it not work. Anyway, they had
[4004.10s -> 4006.78s]  little bars on them, and it was
[4006.78s -> 4008.78s]  loading, it was like a little loading bar.
[4008.78s -> 4010.78s]  It was like one, two, three, four, five. If you had
[4010.78s -> 4012.78s]  five bars of juice,
[4012.78s -> 4016.29s]  it was like you could, why are you saying F?
[4016.29s -> 4022.93s]  What happened? Well stop
[4022.93s -> 4024.93s]  hitting my screen, stop hitting my stream!
[4024.93s -> 4030.18s]  You gotta stop bumping the stream!
[4030.18s -> 4032.18s]  What the fuck are you doing? Relax, sit in your
[4032.18s -> 4034.18s]  chair normally, like
[4034.18s -> 4038.02s]  this, don't move! Oh, isn't Twitch
[4038.02s -> 4040.38s]  having a bunch of problems? Like
[4040.38s -> 4042.38s]  yeah, my, I got no drop
[4042.38s -> 4045.97s]  frames. Right when I start talking about
[4045.97s -> 4047.97s]  this, that's so stupid. Well, Twitch is having
[4047.97s -> 4049.97s]  problems, whatever, it's all good. I've heard about that.
[4049.97s -> 4052.70s]  Alright, let's keep going. Are we good?
[4052.70s -> 4054.70s]  Everybody good for me? Everybody, is it good
[4054.70s -> 4057.26s]  everybody good for me? Like everyone's like
[4057.26s -> 4059.26s]  waiting for me? Are you good for me to
[4059.26s -> 4065.92s]  begin? Are you good for me to start?
[4065.92s -> 4073.98s]  Does it skip? There it was,
[4073.98s -> 4078.53s]  see the bars? Nothing unleashes
[4078.53s -> 4082.56s]  it. Get out of
[4082.56s -> 4084.56s]  the phone? Get out of the phone?
[4086.56s -> 4089.70s]  Wait, hold on.
[4089.70s -> 4092.00s]  I gotta start this again.
[4108.45s -> 4110.45s]  Who is selling
[4110.45s -> 4112.45s]  the car to who?
[4127.63s -> 4129.63s]  It was
[4129.63s -> 4131.63s]  alright, whatever, neither.
[4131.63s -> 4141.63s]  Hold on.
[4141.63s -> 4144.83s]  He's doing,
[4144.83s -> 4146.83s]  Arnold is doing the thing,
[4146.83s -> 4149.58s]  the YouTuber thing,
[4149.58s -> 4151.58s]  where he goes to switch
[4151.58s -> 4153.58s]  the camera off to cut,
[4153.58s -> 4158.32s]  to do a different take. Watch
[4158.32s -> 4160.32s]  him.
[4160.32s -> 4162.32s]  What do you think of anyone who doesn't see this movie?
[4162.32s -> 4167.18s]  Big mistake.
[4167.18s -> 4169.18s]  But it's old. But look
[4169.18s -> 4171.18s]  at what he's doing. It's like he's saying
[4171.18s -> 4173.18s]  his line and then he's like, oh, let me have that one
[4173.18s -> 4175.18s]  turned out. Let me try it again. Think of anyone who
[4175.18s -> 4177.18s]  doesn't see this movie. Big mistake.
[4179.62s -> 4182.18s]  Everybody knows when you do that though. That's why you
[4182.18s -> 4184.18s]  gotta do it in post. There's no way
[4184.18s -> 4186.67s]  to like go, nope, you
[4186.67s -> 4189.74s]  can't move. Different people will know.
[4194.21s -> 4196.21s]  I think it's the biggest movie of the
[4196.21s -> 4198.21s]  summer.
[4198.21s -> 4201.34s]  Burger King and order a flame broiled whopper with
[4201.34s -> 4203.34s]  large fries and a medium drink. You get this last
[4203.34s -> 4205.34s]  action hero. Whoa, that's actually
[4205.34s -> 4207.34s]  sick. Like him, you can be large
[4207.34s -> 4209.34s]  and in charge. So see the movie and
[4209.34s -> 4211.34s]  collect all four cups. It's your way right
[4211.34s -> 4213.34s]  away. I love this place and I'm
[4213.34s -> 4215.34s]  going to see the movie.
[4215.34s -> 4219.06s]  Have you ever opened doors?
[4219.06s -> 4221.06s]  With the sound of your
[4221.06s -> 4225.09s]  voice. Carried your medical
[4225.09s -> 4227.09s]  history in your wallet.
[4227.09s -> 4229.09s]  Your wife's gonna be just fine.
[4229.09s -> 4234.26s]  So this is where we
[4234.26s -> 4236.26s]  attended a meeting.
[4236.26s -> 4239.71s]  Your bare feet.
[4239.71s -> 4243.68s]  Company that'll bring it to you.
[4243.68s -> 4245.68s]  AT&T. Wait.
[4245.68s -> 4247.68s]  Did the internet exist?
[4247.68s -> 4253.44s]  It'll bring it to you.
[4253.44s -> 4255.68s]  When in the 90s is this?
[4255.68s -> 4257.68s]  How early in the 90s?
[4257.68s -> 4259.68s]  This is showing very, very detailed
[4259.68s -> 4262.30s]  video conferencing. You couldn't
[4262.30s -> 4264.30s]  do that.
[4264.30s -> 4267.50s]  Look at this.
[4267.50s -> 4271.26s]  This is
[4271.26s -> 4273.26s]  a detailed video broadcasting
[4273.26s -> 4276.91s]  software. I don't think you could do
[4276.91s -> 4281.84s]  this.
[4283.84s -> 4286.40s]  Also, there's no way anyone could hear what he's saying.
[4286.40s -> 4288.40s]  He's just going off and just talking to himself.
[4288.40s -> 4291.34s]  Hold on. By the way, I've got
[4291.34s -> 4293.34s]  a few other ideas. Let me go over here and talk out
[4293.34s -> 4295.34s]  the window so nobody hears
[4295.34s -> 4299.12s]  what I'm saying.
[4302.83s -> 4305.33s]  He just skipped that guy.
[4305.33s -> 4312.22s]  He's calling it like
[4312.22s -> 4315.10s]  Omegle. He just skipped
[4315.10s -> 4317.66s]  him.
[4317.66s -> 4319.66s]  Your bare feet.
[4319.66s -> 4323.57s]  Company that'll bring it to you.
[4323.57s -> 4326.77s]  AT&T.

[4329.65s -> 4331.65s]  a menace named Dennis.
[4331.65s -> 4333.65s]  Feels warm.
[4333.65s -> 4335.65s]  You need an ashtray.
[4335.65s -> 4337.65s]  This summer, watch out
[4337.65s -> 4339.65s]  for the kid who's causing all the
[4339.65s -> 4342.08s]  excitement.
[4342.08s -> 4344.08s]  What the fuck?

[4354.80s -> 4356.80s]  I remember Dennis the Menace.
[4356.80s -> 4358.80s]  He was actively trying to kill
[4358.80s -> 4363.66s]  Mr. Wilson?
[4363.66s -> 4370.58s]  What?
[4370.58s -> 4372.58s]  In this quiet neighborhood,
[4372.58s -> 4374.58s]  there lives a menace named
[4374.58s -> 4376.58s]  Dennis.

[4378.58s -> 4380.58s]  This summer.
[4380.58s -> 4382.58s]  But he's
[4382.58s -> 4384.58s]  he sees him do that.
[4384.58s -> 4386.82s]  This summer.
[4386.82s -> 4388.82s]  Like, hey, what are you doing with my aspirin?
[4388.82s -> 4390.82s]  Watch out for the kid
[4390.82s -> 4392.82s]  who's causing all the excitement.
[4392.82s -> 4394.82s]  What is happening?

[4436.06s -> 4438.06s]  You can take these.
[4438.06s -> 4440.06s]  You could
[4440.06s -> 4442.06s]  take at least three or four of these
[4442.06s -> 4444.06s]  and they would be for different subjects.
[4444.06s -> 4446.43s]  Like, oh, he's talking about something
[4446.43s -> 4448.43s]  really like weird here in this
[4448.43s -> 4450.43s]  one. I mean, you have to take out the fact that you just
[4450.43s -> 4452.43s]  got flaming, like
[4452.43s -> 4454.43s]  whatever this is. Marshmallow
[4454.43s -> 4456.43s]  grenade
[4456.43s -> 4460.72s]  thrown at his head.
[4460.72s -> 4462.72s]  Excitement.

[4505.33s -> 4507.33s]  new Exerlopers from Exerscience.
[4507.33s -> 4509.33s]  The new idea division of Nordic Track.
[4509.33s -> 4511.33s]  Exerlopers give you a more intense
[4511.33s -> 4513.33s]  workout than ordinary jogs with
[4513.33s -> 4515.33s]  extraordinary fun. Because unlike
[4515.33s -> 4517.33s]  running or jogging, Exerlopers patented
[4517.33s -> 4519.33s]  carbonite spring soles take the
[4519.33s -> 4521.33s]  shock out so your muscles do the work.
[4521.33s -> 4523.33s]  Not your joints. You'll jump
[4523.33s -> 4525.33s]  higher, jump faster, jump
[4525.33s -> 4527.33s]  safer. So put some fun in your run
[4527.33s -> 4529.33s]  with the all new Exerlopers. Because
[4529.33s -> 4531.33s]  for about the same price you'd pay to be
[4531.33s -> 4533.33s]  rolling on the ground, you could be jumping through
[4533.33s -> 4535.82s]  the air. Call our to- Okay, you know what it's
[4535.82s -> 4537.82s]  like to walk around with ice skates
[4537.82s -> 4542.29s]  on? They made that
[4542.29s -> 4550.08s]  feeling and encouraged it.
[4550.08s -> 4552.08s]  I feel like you stepped the wrong way
[4552.08s -> 4554.70s]  on one of these. You are
[4554.70s -> 4560.66s]  snapping your ankle. If they were
[4560.66s -> 4562.66s]  wider, maybe. I don't know.
[4562.66s -> 4565.66s]  They kind of look cool though.
[4565.66s -> 4567.66s]  I feel like I'd want to
[4567.66s -> 4571.42s]  They're kind of cool. I would just
[4571.42s -> 4573.42s]  run around and just bounce around
[4573.42s -> 4579.31s]  with them. I wouldn't use them to run.
[4579.31s -> 4582.58s]  These are too expensive?
[4582.58s -> 4585.14s]  Whoa! I thought it
[4585.14s -> 4587.14s]  was forty bucks. It's four
[4587.14s -> 4589.14s]  forty bucks. Four A-12s.
[4589.14s -> 4591.14s]  This is a hundred and sixty bucks.
[4591.14s -> 4596.88s]  I thought they were forty dollars.
[4596.88s -> 4598.88s]  A hundred and sixty bucks back in like the early
[4598.88s -> 4605.26s]  nineties. That's like
[4605.26s -> 4607.26s]  at least two
[4607.26s -> 4609.26s]  three hundred bucks at this point. Three four hundred?
[4609.26s -> 4614.56s]  Three hundred? Four hundred?
[4614.56s -> 4616.99s]  More than that? Like three fifty? Jesus.
[4616.99s -> 4619.49s]  I hope they worked.
[4619.49s -> 4621.49s]  Cool name.
[4626.18s -> 4630.59s]  You gotta show somebody Duncan.
[4630.59s -> 4632.77s]  Show somebody-
[4638.77s -> 4641.39s]  This was a good take, but it's very clear
[4641.39s -> 4643.39s]  that he has lost control when he lands.
[4643.39s -> 4645.76s]  And he's running into the people
[4645.76s -> 4647.76s]  that are also extras or in the
[4647.76s -> 4651.73s]  commercial.
[4651.73s -> 4653.97s]  He gets air here.
[4655.97s -> 4658.85s]  He's kind of like, oh shit
[4658.85s -> 4662.24s]  you're right here man.
[4662.24s -> 4664.24s]  They already showed somebody Duncan? No they didn't.
[4664.24s -> 4667.82s]  Jump and condition your body.

[4702.83s -> 4705.39s]  show up with these, you're like, alright, we're gonna
[4705.39s -> 4707.39s]  do blue shirts
[4707.39s -> 4710.21s]  versus red shirts. Okay, here we go.
[4710.21s -> 4712.21s]  If you wear those, it's just like a pick up basketball
[4712.21s -> 4714.21s]  game. Are you gonna get, are they gonna allow
[4714.21s -> 4719.07s]  you to wear those? Is it like, hey
[4719.07s -> 4722.66s]  bro, you gotta take those off. They're my shoes.
[4722.66s -> 4725.07s]  I didn't bring any other shoes.
[4725.07s -> 4727.76s]  These are the only things I have. You didn't bring any
[4727.76s -> 4731.52s]  other shoes? No.
[4731.52s -> 4733.52s]  Well, I guess we're gonna have to let you play.
[4733.52s -> 4736.72s]  Break them off? No, break them off.
[4736.72s -> 4740.24s]  These were $350
[4740.24s -> 4742.24s]  USD, 2023
[4742.24s -> 4747.04s]  upscaling. The, I actually
[4747.04s -> 4750.24s]  think, I wanna try these.
[4750.24s -> 4752.24s]  They actually kinda look like they would be fun.

[4757.49s -> 4763.06s]  nothing to lose.
[4763.06s -> 4765.06s]  Maybe not. I don't know.

[4767.06s -> 4769.06s]  to be Exerloping. Order now
[4769.06s -> 4771.06s]  and we'll include our electronic pedometer

[4777.06s -> 4779.06s]  ten back handsprings
[4779.06s -> 4782.00s]  right after it. Just one, two,
[4782.00s -> 4784.00s]  three, four, five,
[4784.00s -> 4786.00s]  six and then fade into this. That would have been

[4790.80s -> 4792.80s]  value. Order now.
[4792.80s -> 4794.80s]  You're in comedy

[4839.87s -> 4841.87s]  thirst a diet squirt.
[4841.87s -> 4844.24s]  You are on the air.
[4844.24s -> 4846.24s]  You called the radio station? Sam Baldwin
[4846.24s -> 4848.24s]  isn't looking for anyone special.
[4848.24s -> 4850.24s]  Some kid calls a phone in radio show and
[4850.24s -> 4852.24s]  says that his dad needs a new wife.
[4852.24s -> 4854.24s]  And now 2,000 women want his number.
[4854.24s -> 4856.24s]  But someone special. What if this man is my destiny
[4856.24s -> 4858.24s]  and I never meet him? He's looking for him.
[4858.24s -> 4860.24s]  Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?
[4860.24s -> 4862.99s]  You wouldn't let me. Tom Hanks.
[4862.99s -> 4864.99s]  This is really fun. Meg Ryan.
[4864.99s -> 4866.99s]  Is this crazy? Sleepless in Seattle.
[4866.99s -> 4868.99s]  Think Cary Grant. Rated PG.
[4868.99s -> 4871.36s]  I'd like to play you something that I
[4871.36s -> 4873.36s]  recorded literally yesterday.
[4873.36s -> 4878.14s]  Those of you that have, this is
[4878.14s -> 4880.32s]  a great, great segue. So those of you that have been
[4880.32s -> 4882.32s]  on the channel for a long time, you know
[4882.32s -> 4885.07s]  that whenever
[4885.07s -> 4887.50s]  I get a lot of food in my throat, I get
[4887.50s -> 4890.26s]  the Tom Hanks voice. And let me tell you
[4890.26s -> 4893.46s]  what I recorded is
[4893.46s -> 4896.53s]  unbelievable. I caught
[4896.53s -> 4899.33s]  it super perfectly.
[4899.33s -> 4904.83s]  Super good. So the Tom Hanks
[4904.83s -> 4906.83s]  voice thing I'm talking about, yeah.
[4906.83s -> 4908.83s]  If you eat and you get food kind of stuck a little bit there,
[4908.83s -> 4910.83s]  like milk voice a little bit, for some reason
[4910.83s -> 4913.58s]  it makes me sound just like him.
[4913.58s -> 4915.58s]  So I recorded this. This was literally last night.
[4915.58s -> 4921.01s]  Then I won't sound like Tom Hanks anymore.
[4921.01s -> 4923.18s]  And when you get, when you finally get the
[4923.18s -> 4925.18s]  Tom Hanks voice, that's when you really
[4925.18s -> 4927.18s]  can shine as an actor.
[4927.18s -> 4929.18s]  And be a part of, I was in Forrest Gump
[4929.18s -> 4931.18s]  and I was
[4931.18s -> 4933.36s]  you know, I was Woody in Toy Story
[4933.36s -> 4935.36s]  remember? It's me, Woody,
[4935.36s -> 4937.36s]  and you buzz are gonna get us
[4937.36s -> 4941.07s]  in trouble with Andy. It's gone.
[4941.07s -> 4952.26s]  Fuck. There you go.
[4952.26s -> 4956.74s]  That lasted a very long time.
[4956.74s -> 4964.86s]  That lasted so long.
[4964.86s -> 4968.32s]  Holly said to me last night,
[4968.32s -> 4970.82s]  she's like, Dad, that was really good, but
[4970.82s -> 4973.89s]  what are you talking about? Buzz, you're
[4973.89s -> 4975.89s]  gonna get us in trouble with Andy.
[4975.89s -> 4979.28s]  Was, yeah, they don't
[4979.28s -> 4981.90s]  Andy's not like their
[4981.90s -> 4983.90s]  like dad. Andy doesn't even know
[4983.90s -> 4988.58s]  they exist. It was just filler,
[4988.58s -> 4990.58s]  filler, filler. I had to get it quick. It was
[4990.58s -> 4992.58s]  quick, quick, quick. I gotta get it quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[4992.58s -> 4995.71s]  Although that's the point though.
[4995.71s -> 5001.78s]  I couldn't do that right
[5001.78s -> 5003.78s]  now if I tried. No, you
[5003.78s -> 5006.72s]  can't. He's got a very distinct voice.
[5006.72s -> 5013.31s]  Special sneak preview Saturday night.
[5013.31s -> 5015.31s]  You're 37, supposedly.
[5043.55s -> 5045.55s]  And scandal.
[5047.55s -> 5049.55s]  Who is this lady supposed to be?
[5049.55s -> 5053.39s]  You know, all those things,
[5053.39s -> 5055.39s]  all those things that you hear about the Kennedys
[5055.39s -> 5057.57s]  eyes in it.
[5057.57s -> 5060.58s]  It was me.
[5060.58s -> 5062.58s]  But they don't explain who that lady is?
[5062.58s -> 5064.58s]  I am the person
[5064.58s -> 5066.58s]  who started the rumors about the Kennedys
[5066.58s -> 5068.58s]  and Marilyn Monroe.
[5068.58s -> 5070.58s]  It was me.
[5070.58s -> 5076.83s]  It's so
[5076.83s -> 5085.39s]  stupid.
[5085.39s -> 5087.39s]  Why is she evil?
[5087.39s -> 5090.59s]  VH1's new show that makes
[5090.59s -> 5092.59s]  Gotham a king where no
[5092.59s -> 5094.59s]  star is sacred. The men share
[5094.59s -> 5096.59s]  married, dated, or had sex with.
[5096.59s -> 5098.59s]  And scandal scores.
[5098.59s -> 5100.59s]  Watch Rumor Has It every Monday
[5100.59s -> 5102.59s]  through Thursday at 7 and 11
[5102.59s -> 5104.59s]  Eastern on VH1.
[5104.59s -> 5106.59s]  Jack, Bobby, Norma Jean,
[5106.59s -> 5109.58s]  I'm so sorry.
[5120.02s -> 5122.58s]  The first part and the end part
[5122.58s -> 5124.58s]  of that commercial don't
[5124.58s -> 5129.12s]  need to be there.
[5129.12s -> 5131.12s]  I guess it's funny.
[5131.12s -> 5133.12s]  Is it funny?
[5133.12s -> 5135.62s]  They could have just done the commercial
[5135.62s -> 5137.62s]  of the show, but they had to have
[5137.62s -> 5140.24s]  this old lady.
[5140.24s -> 5142.24s]  It was me. I spread those rumors.
[5142.24s -> 5144.24s]  I'm so sorry for what I've done.
[5146.24s -> 5148.24s]  The controversial new series
[5148.24s -> 5150.24s]  from Time Life Books had a few choice
[5150.24s -> 5152.24s]  words to share with us.
[5152.24s -> 5159.09s]  It was clear
[5159.09s -> 5165.04s]  that true crime digs deeper than
[5167.04s -> 5169.04s]  Somebody just dropped
[5169.04s -> 5171.34s]  like a big steel pot
[5171.34s -> 5174.10s]  down a flight of stairs with us.
[5174.10s -> 5176.10s]  It's just a long
[5176.10s -> 5178.10s]  hotel stairwell or something.
[5178.10s -> 5180.10s]  People who've read true crime,
[5180.10s -> 5182.10s]  the controversial new series from
[5182.10s -> 5184.10s]  Time Life Books had a few choice words

[5259.74s -> 5261.74s]  It's just a car

[5265.74s -> 5271.89s]  for the... Why do you have a car
[5271.89s -> 5275.09s]  stereo in your pocket? Isn't that
[5275.09s -> 5277.09s]  the ultimate insecurity?
[5277.09s -> 5279.09s]  You see it's a detachable face for the
[5279.09s -> 5282.35s]  car stereo.
[5282.35s -> 5284.35s]  Why would you bring it through
[5284.35s -> 5286.35s]  the...

[5296.90s -> 5298.90s]  We've got some kind of device.
[5303.57s -> 5305.57s]  It's the JFK
[5305.57s -> 5308.13s]  lady?
[5308.13s -> 5312.59s]  No it's not.
[5312.59s -> 5314.59s]  7-11 Eastern on VH1
[5314.59s -> 5316.59s]  Jack, Bobby,
[5316.59s -> 5318.96s]  Norma Jean, I'm so
[5318.96s -> 5320.96s]  sorry.
[5320.96s -> 5322.96s]  No it's not.
[5322.96s -> 5325.78s]  It's not.
[5325.78s -> 5328.53s]  It's just
[5328.53s -> 5330.90s]  an old lady.
[5330.90s -> 5332.90s]  It's just an old lady.
[5332.90s -> 5334.90s]  Don't touch the button. Quiet please.
[5334.90s -> 5337.20s]  It's just a car stereo.
[5337.20s -> 5339.20s]  Wait, he's touching the buttons?
[5339.20s -> 5341.20s]  Don't touch the button. Dude, don't
[5341.20s -> 5343.20s]  do that. Like come on.
[5343.20s -> 5346.78s]  If you go through... You're going through security
[5346.78s -> 5349.28s]  and it's like
[5349.28s -> 5351.28s]  dee dee dee... Hold on a second there.
[5351.28s -> 5353.65s]  What's in your pocket there sir?
[5353.65s -> 5355.65s]  Oh well you see. We've got a device
[5355.65s -> 5359.34s]  and you start going... What?
[5359.34s -> 5361.34s]  No it's not.
[5361.34s -> 5363.34s]  Not a situation.
[5363.34s -> 5366.22s]  Don't touch the button. Quiet please.
[5366.22s -> 5369.10s]  He wasn't doing that.
[5369.10s -> 5371.10s]  Yes ma'am.
[5371.10s -> 5373.47s]  Not a situation.
[5373.47s -> 5375.47s]  That's his finger right here. This is somebody else's hand.
[5375.47s -> 5380.21s]  That's somebody else's hand touching
[5380.21s -> 5384.82s]  the buttons. The old lady sounds like
[5384.82s -> 5387.06s]  Lois.
[5387.06s -> 5389.06s]  Quiet please. It's just a car
[5389.06s -> 5391.06s]  stereo.
[5391.06s -> 5393.06s]  We've got some kind of device.
[5393.06s -> 5395.06s]  We've got some kind of device.
[5395.06s -> 5397.06s]  Not a situation.
[5397.06s -> 5399.06s]  Quiet please.
[5399.06s -> 5401.06s]  It's just a car stereo.
[5401.06s -> 5403.06s]  Pioneer car stereo.
[5403.06s -> 5405.81s]  It's all for you Adi.
[5405.81s -> 5407.98s]  I know we've been on this one for a little while
[5407.98s -> 5409.98s]  but this is the type of reaction that characters
[5409.98s -> 5412.48s]  in Hitman have to you.
[5412.48s -> 5414.48s]  This is like AI. Like you walked over
[5414.48s -> 5416.48s]  to an AI and all of a sudden it's like
[5416.48s -> 5418.48s]  they're going through their few routines
[5418.48s -> 5420.98s]  that they have.
[5420.98s -> 5422.98s]  Like this guy
[5422.98s -> 5424.98s]  just kind of bumped into
[5424.98s -> 5427.98s]  that guy. And this whole thing
[5427.98s -> 5430.61s]  unfolded. He got like a little
[5430.61s -> 5432.61s]  GTA. He got a little too close.
[5432.61s -> 5434.61s]  Or the AI just all of a sudden now
[5434.61s -> 5436.61s]  there's something that needs to be taken care of now.
[5436.61s -> 5438.85s]  Yes ma'am. Not a situation.
[5438.85s -> 5440.85s]  Don't touch the buttons. Quiet please.
[5440.85s -> 5442.85s]  It's just a car
[5442.85s -> 5444.85s]  stereo.
[5444.85s -> 5446.85s]  Pioneer car stereos offer you a detachable
[5446.85s -> 5448.85s]  face for the ultimate in security.
[5448.85s -> 5450.85s]  You see it's a detachable
[5450.85s -> 5452.85s]  face for the car stereo.
[5452.85s -> 5454.85s]  I have no idea what you just said.
[5454.85s -> 5456.85s]  Hey, you know what it takes to get
[5456.85s -> 5458.85s]  ahead. Performance.
[5458.85s -> 5462.88s]  You know what it takes to stay
[5462.88s -> 5464.88s]  on track. Control.
[5464.88s -> 5468.27s]  You know what it takes
[5468.27s -> 5470.27s]  to lead the way.
[5470.27s -> 5472.27s]  So do we. The Grand Am
[5472.27s -> 5474.27s]  Sport Coupe. V6
[5474.27s -> 5476.27s]  Performance. The control
[5476.27s -> 5478.27s]  of anti-lock brakes.
[5478.27s -> 5483.07s]  Excitement.
[5483.07s -> 5487.10s]  The only reason you would have a drive like this
[5487.10s -> 5489.10s]  in these commercials is if you thought you were going to shit
[5489.10s -> 5491.10s]  your pants and you had to make it to a bathroom
[5491.10s -> 5506.53s]  as soon as possible. They saw
[5506.53s -> 5508.53s]  you flying around these little roads.
[5508.53s -> 5522.32s]  Look at that
[5522.32s -> 5529.42s]  back. Toastitos restaurant
[5529.42s -> 5532.69s]  style tortilla chips.
[5532.69s -> 5534.69s]  You've never had it this good.
[5534.69s -> 5536.69s]  It's too tall.
[5536.69s -> 5538.69s]  This is the taste
[5538.69s -> 5543.10s]  that takes you there.
[5543.10s -> 5545.79s]  It's cool that they did
[5545.79s -> 5547.79s]  this commercial, but you know I don't appreciate the
[5547.79s -> 5551.38s]  multi-boxing.
[5551.38s -> 5554.51s]  This is the
[5554.51s -> 5556.51s]  taste that takes you there.
[5556.51s -> 5574.50s]  A plus.
[5574.50s -> 5576.50s]  That was an A plus.
[5576.50s -> 5578.50s]  That was to the point.
[5578.50s -> 5580.50s]  That was very much just to the point.
[5580.50s -> 5582.50s]  It was just, hey, Tabasco is fucking awesome.
[5582.50s -> 5585.57s]  When that first little drop comes out
[5585.57s -> 5588.13s]  it's like, this is cool.
[5588.13s -> 5591.31s]  It's like, yeah. Tabasco
[5591.31s -> 5595.86s]  is gross?
[5595.86s -> 5598.29s]  That's just
[5598.29s -> 5602.88s]  no. I don't
[5602.88s -> 5604.88s]  trust anybody that says that
[5604.88s -> 5606.88s]  Tabasco is gross. If you say
[5606.88s -> 5608.88s]  that Tabasco is not your favorite.
[5608.88s -> 5610.88s]  You say that Tabasco is something you don't choose.
[5610.88s -> 5612.88s]  I don't prefer Tabasco, but
[5612.88s -> 5616.14s]  saying Tabasco is gross.
[5616.14s -> 5620.30s]  I don't trust you. Mods, can we get a poll
[5620.30s -> 5624.14s]  real quick? Is Tabasco
[5624.14s -> 5626.14s]  gross? And remember, gross
[5626.14s -> 5628.14s]  does not mean I don't really like
[5628.14s -> 5630.14s]  it. Gross means like you taste it and you're like
[5630.14s -> 5633.73s]  ugh. Just regular, just Tabasco.
[5633.73s -> 5638.27s]  The default Tabasco. Tabasco on eggs
[5638.27s -> 5640.27s]  is amazing. Yes it is. It's also amazing
[5640.27s -> 5650.24s]  on pizza. Is it gross?
[5650.24s -> 5652.24s]  If this is more than 10 to 20 percent, then that's
[5652.24s -> 5656.98s]  no way. I want to do one more thing
[5656.98s -> 5662.46s]  after this before we keep going.
[5662.46s -> 5667.52s]  20 percent so far.
[5667.52s -> 5677.25s]  Gross? Why do you think it's gross?
[5677.25s -> 5683.07s]  Enjoy your vinegar water.
[5683.07s -> 5685.07s]  Don't ever have salad dressing ever again for the rest of your life.
[5685.07s -> 5697.62s]  Alright, alright, close that
[5697.62s -> 5699.62s]  poll. 21 percent said it was gross.
[5699.62s -> 5705.18s]  I have a new poll I'd like to run.
[5705.18s -> 5708.13s]  Because this is going to determine how I feel.
[5708.13s -> 5711.01s]  Okay. So remember, is it gross?
[5711.01s -> 5715.22s]  Is Sriracha
[5715.22s -> 5717.22s]  gross? New poll. Yes or no?
[5717.22s -> 5720.10s]  Is Sriracha gross?
[5720.10s -> 5728.22s]  Let's see. I'm curious.
[5728.22s -> 5743.20s]  I want to see how this lines up.
[5743.20s -> 5748.00s]  It's almost the exact same.
[5748.00s -> 5750.00s]  It's actually almost identical.
[5750.00s -> 5752.50s]  Do 20 percent of you just
[5752.50s -> 5754.50s]  don't like, you just hate hot sauce?
[5754.50s -> 5759.49s]  It's the exact same.
[5759.49s -> 5762.05s]  I think that 20 percent of you just don't
[5762.05s -> 5764.86s]  like hot stuff. So
[5764.86s -> 5768.05s]  it's good. Alright. I probably should
[5768.05s -> 5770.86s]  have worded this better. If you like
[5770.86s -> 5772.86s]  hot sauce, it's
[5772.86s -> 5778.50s]  whatever. I got what I wanted out of
[5778.50s -> 5782.96s]  this. I prefer Tabasco.
[5782.96s -> 5786.85s]  You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying?
[5786.85s -> 5789.66s]  You know what I'm saying? I prefer Tabasco.
[5789.66s -> 5798.48s]  You know what I mean? No, we're not doing a
[5798.48s -> 5804.50s]  no. No new poll. No new poll.
[5804.50s -> 5806.50s]  I like Cholula. Yeah.
[5806.50s -> 5809.12s]  But, very
[5809.12s -> 5811.36s]  important thing about Cholula. See, to
[5811.36s -> 5814.05s]  me, Cholula is
[5814.05s -> 5816.05s]  good on different
[5816.05s -> 5818.05s]  foods. I prefer Cholula
[5818.05s -> 5820.05s]  in a taco. I prefer
[5820.05s -> 5822.05s]  Cholula in, you know,
[5822.05s -> 5824.05s]  with like avocado and
[5824.05s -> 5826.05s]  not, I can't say which
[5826.05s -> 5828.35s]  one's better because I prefer
[5828.35s -> 5830.91s]  Cholula on very specific
[5830.91s -> 5836.59s]  foods, right? Tapatio is also
[5836.59s -> 5838.59s]  great. I would put it in the same category as Cholula.
[5838.59s -> 5843.39s]  Yeah, they're not exactly the same
[5843.39s -> 5845.95s]  kind of sauce, but I actually
[5845.95s -> 5849.60s]  really don't like Sriracha. I don't,
[5849.60s -> 5852.10s]  I don't know. I don't like it. I don't think
[5852.10s -> 5854.10s]  it's gross. I just don't
[5854.10s -> 5860.37s]  really like it.
[5860.37s -> 5866.06s]  I don't vacation
[5866.06s -> 5876.80s]  in the South of- What is it?
[5876.80s -> 5882.30s]  This is a pretty, this is going to be a hard one. I'm going to
[5882.30s -> 5886.40s]  say coffee. Either coffee
[5886.40s -> 5893.12s]  or, I'm going to say life insurance.
[5893.12s -> 5895.49s]  A vacation planner.
[5895.49s -> 5898.18s]  I'm going to say it's, it's, it's
[5898.18s -> 5900.18s]  consumable. It's a coffee. It's a beverage.
[5900.18s -> 5904.53s]  An airline. That's a good one.
[5904.53s -> 5908.93s]  Insurance?
[5908.93s -> 5913.39s]  Okay. Okay. Let's see who's right.
[5913.39s -> 5915.39s]  Simple, I go
[5915.39s -> 5917.39s]  easy.
[5917.39s -> 5919.39s]  I go Greyhound. This
[5919.39s -> 5921.39s]  summer, go Greyhound anywhere, anytime
[5921.39s -> 5923.39s]  for $149 or less.
[5923.39s -> 5925.39s]  No restrictions or advance purchase.
[5925.39s -> 5929.04s]  I go simple, easy.
[5929.04s -> 5932.88s]  Greyhound bus.
[5932.88s -> 5934.88s]  And leave the driving to us.
[5934.88s -> 5937.25s]  This program is brought to you by
[5937.25s -> 5939.25s]  Kodak Gold Film.
[5939.25s -> 5942.00s]  Okay, what's this one?
[5942.00s -> 5944.00s]  For your brand new baby, a
[5944.00s -> 5946.00s]  brand new film.
[5946.00s -> 5948.00s]  Ah, the Kodak Gold.
[5948.00s -> 5950.82s]  Moncruise?
[5950.82s -> 5952.82s]  Introducing Kodak Gold Ultra
[5952.82s -> 5954.82s]  400. Why is this so chaotic?
[5954.82s -> 5956.82s]  A new film so versatile, it can catch rich,
[5956.82s -> 5958.82s]  accurate colors in almost any light.
[5958.82s -> 5960.82s]  Day
[5960.82s -> 5962.82s]  and night.
[5962.82s -> 5964.82s]  New Kodak Gold Ultra 400.
[5964.82s -> 5966.82s]  Would you trust your moment to anything less?
[5966.82s -> 5972.90s]  Holy shit!
[5972.90s -> 5974.90s]  This one, I can't even process this one.
[5974.90s -> 5978.42s]  All I know is I thought that was Tom Cruise.
[5978.42s -> 5980.42s]  Introducing Kodak Gold
[5980.42s -> 5982.42s]  Ultra 400.
[5982.42s -> 5984.42s]  A new film so versatile.
[5984.42s -> 5987.17s]  Dad, you did it wrong.
[5987.17s -> 5989.17s]  You don't blblblbl. After you take the picture
[5989.17s -> 5991.17s]  you blblblbl. Then you take the
[5991.17s -> 5993.17s]  photo. What a fucking amateur move that
[5993.17s -> 5996.75s]  was, huh?
[5996.75s -> 5998.75s]  Kodak Gold Ultra 400.
[5998.75s -> 6000.75s]  A new film so versatile, it can catch rich,
[6000.75s -> 6002.75s]  accurate colors in almost any light.
[6002.75s -> 6004.75s]  Day
[6004.75s -> 6006.75s]  and night.
[6006.75s -> 6008.75s]  New Kodak Gold Ultra 400.
[6008.75s -> 6010.75s]  Would you trust your moment to anything
[6010.75s -> 6012.93s]  less?
[6012.93s -> 6014.93s]  Why are you giving baby photography advice
[6014.93s -> 6016.93s]  to a person
[6016.93s -> 6018.93s]  like 20 years ago?
[6018.93s -> 6020.93s]  If you found a way to save America millions of
[6020.93s -> 6023.10s]  dollars a year, how would you tell
[6023.10s -> 6027.78s]  them? Introducing
[6027.78s -> 6029.78s]  1-800-Collect. Now
[6029.78s -> 6031.78s]  America's least expensive way to call
[6031.78s -> 6033.78s]  someone collect.
[6033.78s -> 6036.78s]  I thought it was going to be
[6036.78s -> 6038.78s]  how do we save?
[6038.78s -> 6040.78s]  To make the long distance charges easier for your friends and
[6040.78s -> 6042.78s]  family to accept.
[6042.78s -> 6047.58s]  I thought they were talking about
[6047.58s -> 6049.58s]  the government budget or something.
[6049.58s -> 6052.53s]  It's a number that
[6052.53s -> 6054.53s]  belongs to everyone. Everywhere
[6054.53s -> 6056.53s]  in the US.
[6056.53s -> 6058.53s]  Every time they need to make a
[6058.53s -> 6060.53s]  collect call.
[6060.53s -> 6062.77s]  1-800-Collect.
[6062.77s -> 6066.10s]  How does this sound?
[6066.10s -> 6068.10s]  Now you can have all the
[6068.10s -> 6070.10s]  crisp, refreshing taste of a
[6070.10s -> 6072.10s]  great beer without all the alcohol.
[6072.10s -> 6074.10s]  Miller Sharps.
[6074.10s -> 6076.10s]  Great beer taste
[6076.10s -> 6079.94s]  anytime.

[6195.44s -> 6199.28s]  gun checked. He really did.
[6199.28s -> 6201.28s]  He got gun checked.
[6201.28s -> 6203.28s]  Everybody now.
[6227.70s -> 6230.19s]  You know what's so funny though?
[6230.19s -> 6232.19s]  I know I've been pausing a lot today,
[6232.19s -> 6234.19s]  but this is ridiculous.
[6234.19s -> 6238.19s]  You have to try
[6238.19s -> 6240.19s]  to do this. This like hurts.
[6240.19s -> 6242.19s]  Nobody actually
[6242.19s -> 6244.19s]  looks like that. Just sitting around.
[6244.19s -> 6246.82s]  They really don't. You have
[6246.82s -> 6249.57s]  to like, you have to like,
[6249.57s -> 6257.04s]  ah, that hurts.
[6257.04s -> 6259.92s]  I want to try it.
[6259.92s -> 6265.23s]  Is this weird? Is this
[6265.23s -> 6272.78s]  weird what I'm doing here?
[6272.78s -> 6274.78s]  Is this weird? This is weird.
[6274.78s -> 6276.78s]  This is kind of weird. I'll do it with the shirt on.
[6276.78s -> 6286.51s]  No, never mind.
[6286.51s -> 6288.51s]  This lady.
[6288.51s -> 6290.51s]  Just the, you know, the sunglasses
[6290.51s -> 6292.51s]  down like, I don't know
[6292.51s -> 6296.74s]  about what I see over there.
[6300.26s -> 6303.26s]  I want to like slow it down.
[6303.26s -> 6305.44s]  God damn it. It's so funny.
[6305.44s -> 6309.73s]  We need to make this slower. It's almost like he's
[6309.73s -> 6317.22s]  doing it on purpose.
[6333.66s -> 6335.66s]  How does he know what she is
[6335.66s -> 6338.48s]  looking at here? He does
[6338.48s -> 6344.88s]  it before he even looks down, right?
[6344.88s -> 6346.88s]  It's like, how did he know?
[6346.88s -> 6356.86s]  Why?
[6356.86s -> 6358.86s]  Why would you just
[6358.86s -> 6360.86s]  sit there just looking at
[6360.86s -> 6363.17s]  a group of people doing like
[6363.17s -> 6365.17s]  hey, look at how fat I am.
[6367.34s -> 6375.86s]  I'm reading too far into it.
[6375.86s -> 6378.03s]  It's doing it for me.
[6378.03s -> 6380.03s]  I don't know. It's fucking weird.
[6380.03s -> 6384.58s]  This guy actually like, he's
[6384.58s -> 6386.58s]  like, he's bent.
[6386.58s -> 6390.48s]  He's sucking it in.
[6390.48s -> 6396.11s]  He's doing it for you. What are
[6396.11s -> 6405.26s]  you talking about?
[6405.26s -> 6407.26s]  We're moving on.
[6414.27s -> 6416.27s]  It's a diaper commercial.
[6416.27s -> 6418.27s]  We're just gonna move on.
[6426.27s -> 6428.27s]  I can't get over that guy.
[6428.27s -> 6430.27s]  He's stuck.
[6430.27s -> 6432.27s]  He's stuck up here.
[6432.27s -> 6434.27s]  I can't get him out.
[6436.27s -> 6438.27s]  What the?
[6442.27s -> 6444.27s]  Oh, it's a joke.
[6444.27s -> 6446.27s]  It even slices and dices, makes thousands of
[6446.27s -> 6448.27s]  julienne fries. But wait, you can
[6448.27s -> 6450.27s]  play it too. This free Sonic 2
[6450.27s -> 6452.27s]  is a $54.99 value. You get two
[6452.27s -> 6454.27s]  Sonics for the price of one. Sonic 2 fits

[6458.27s -> 6460.27s]  fun. And pets love it too. Buy the Sega

[6464.27s -> 6466.27s]  sweater sold separately. That was cute.
[6466.27s -> 6471.07s]  That was cute. I liked that one.
[6478.78s -> 6480.78s]  Three episodes for $4.95 including
[6480.78s -> 6482.78s]  the first episode ever aired.
[6482.78s -> 6484.78s]  Where is your bathroom?
[6484.78s -> 6486.78s]  Next to my bedroom.
[6486.78s -> 6488.78s]  Enjoy Cheers anytime you like.
[6488.78s -> 6490.78s]  I'm thinking about proposing.
[6493.22s -> 6495.22s]  Three episodes?
[6495.22s -> 6499.82s]  Excuse me, fella. I left a package in your mailbox
[6499.82s -> 6501.82s]  that belongs next door. That's the one.
[6501.82s -> 6503.82s]  Thanks.
[6503.82s -> 6505.82s]  Three episodes?
[6505.82s -> 6509.98s]  Keeping everybody?
[6509.98s -> 6511.98s]  Don't say adios to the good people at Cheers.
[6511.98s -> 6513.98s]  Keep the laughs coming with your Cheers video
[6513.98s -> 6515.98s]  cassettes. Deliver it right to your door
[6515.98s -> 6517.98s]  by five million women in uniform.
[6517.98s -> 6521.23s]  Use your credit card.
[6521.23s -> 6523.23s]  It's because it's a VHS
[6523.23s -> 6526.05s]  guys.
[6526.05s -> 6528.05s]  VHS's were at maximum
[6528.05s -> 6530.05s]  they were what? 90 minutes?
[6530.05s -> 6533.68s]  Yeah. Cause there was two
[6533.68s -> 6535.68s]  recording versions of VHS.
[6535.68s -> 6537.68s]  You could do 60
[6537.68s -> 6539.68s]  or 120 or 60 or 90, right?
[6539.68s -> 6544.08s]  What was the difference?
[6544.08s -> 6546.08s]  Was it the size of the
[6546.08s -> 6548.32s]  tape or something?
[6548.32s -> 6550.32s]  It was 120 max.
[6550.32s -> 6552.32s]  It was a lower resolution on 90.
[6552.32s -> 6554.50s]  It was the quality difference.
[6554.50s -> 6559.10s]  So weird. Hearing this now
[6559.10s -> 6561.86s]  this is so strange to see this.
[6561.86s -> 6568.13s]  Three episodes.
[6568.13s -> 6571.63s]  And guess what? Back
[6571.63s -> 6573.63s]  I know a lot of people might not be used to this
[6573.63s -> 6575.63s]  it used to take sometimes
[6575.63s -> 6578.06s]  two plus months
[6578.06s -> 6580.06s]  for you to get something that you ordered.
[6580.06s -> 6582.37s]  Like from one of these
[6582.37s -> 6585.57s]  hotline numbers. Sometimes it would take months.
[6585.57s -> 6589.15s]  Two or three months. Which is crazy.
[6589.15s -> 6594.85s]  Wow.
[6594.85s -> 6596.85s]  Read that fine print.
[6596.85s -> 6598.85s]  And call now for your first three episodes.
[6598.85s -> 6600.85s]  Cheers video cassette for
[6600.85s -> 6602.85s]  $4.95. Call.
[6602.85s -> 6604.85s]  Subscription is subject to review.
[6604.85s -> 6606.85s]  Sales tax added with subscription.
[6606.85s -> 6608.85s]  Wait, hold on.
[6608.85s -> 6610.85s]  Use your credit card and call.
[6610.85s -> 6612.85s]  Future three
[6612.85s -> 6614.85s]  episode videos sent every four to six weeks
[6614.85s -> 6616.85s]  and are $19.95
[6616.85s -> 6621.71s]  each.
[6621.71s -> 6624.78s]  Wait a minute. So it's $5 plus shipping
[6624.78s -> 6626.96s]  they give you three episodes
[6626.96s -> 6629.97s]  and then every two
[6629.97s -> 6631.97s]  months they send you three more
[6631.97s -> 6633.97s]  episodes but now it's $20.
[6633.97s -> 6642.03s]  How many episodes are in Cheers?
[6642.03s -> 6644.03s]  Can somebody look this up really quick? I guess I could right here.
[6644.03s -> 6646.03s]  How many episodes are in Cheers?
[6646.03s -> 6650.96s]  The whole series. There are hundreds of them.
[6650.96s -> 6655.57s]  There's like 200.
[6655.57s -> 6657.57s]  There are 273 episodes
[6657.57s -> 6659.57s]  of Cheers. Oh my god.
[6659.57s -> 6663.92s]  Hold on.
[6663.92s -> 6665.92s]  $20
[6665.92s -> 6668.54s]  for three episodes.
[6668.54s -> 6670.54s]  We need some math here.
[6670.54s -> 6673.49s]  So you'd get 91
[6673.49s -> 6677.01s]  tapes. It would cost
[6677.01s -> 6679.01s]  $2,000.
[6679.01s -> 6682.08s]  $2,000 for the whole
[6682.08s -> 6684.08s]  thing. And how long would it
[6684.08s -> 6686.08s]  take for you to get it? Like over
[6686.08s -> 6688.08s]  the course of like seven years?
[6688.08s -> 6697.55s]  It would take
[6697.55s -> 6700.88s]  years. They probably wouldn't
[6700.88s -> 6702.88s]  even be in circulation anymore by the time you got the
[6702.88s -> 6706.34s]  last episode. Weirdly enough.
[6706.34s -> 6709.22s]  This is very weirdly enough.
[6709.22s -> 6711.39s]  By the time that you are on
[6711.39s -> 6713.82s]  episode 200 or so,
[6713.82s -> 6715.82s]  DVDs I think have come out
[6715.82s -> 6720.24s]  by now. So you don't need this
[6720.24s -> 6722.24s]  subscription anymore. What were they thinking?
[6722.24s -> 6728.38s]  Maybe they thought that VHS
[6728.38s -> 6730.38s]  was just, this is it. It's VHS's.
[6730.38s -> 6734.34s]  That's it. You would need an
[6734.34s -> 6736.34s]  entire room for your Cheers VHS
[6736.34s -> 6738.51s]  collection. Yeah, it would be almost a hundred tapes.
[6738.51s -> 6741.90s]  And I think that would be kind of weird.
[6741.90s -> 6744.78s]  I felt like if I went over somebody's house
[6744.78s -> 6747.02s]  and they had a wall
[6747.02s -> 6749.46s]  just a huge bookcase
[6749.46s -> 6751.46s]  with a hundred tapes on it,
[6751.46s -> 6755.17s]  all of it was Cheers, you would
[6755.17s -> 6757.17s]  walk into that room and go, oh, nice, I got a
[6757.17s -> 6759.17s]  bookshelf. I wonder, what do you got? The Great Gatsby
[6759.17s -> 6761.98s]  on there? Oh, whatever. Every
[6761.98s -> 6763.98s]  single thing here is a Cheers VHS tape.
[6763.98s -> 6767.57s]  Every single thing on the shelf.
[6767.57s -> 6773.01s]  Everything. All right. I mean, that's
[6773.01s -> 6779.39s]  I wonder what these are worth now.
[6779.39s -> 6782.46s]  It's almost $4,000 today.
[6782.46s -> 6786.62s]  Wow. And right now you could probably go
[6786.62s -> 6789.44s]  watch Cheers on a ton of different
[6789.44s -> 6791.68s]  services and not have to spend like
[6791.68s -> 6795.97s]  five grand. You could probably just go watch it
[6795.97s -> 6798.40s]  right now. Even if you bought the whole thing
[6798.40s -> 6800.40s]  from like iTunes, it probably wouldn't cost
[6800.40s -> 6802.40s]  you even close to what, like
[6802.40s -> 6804.40s]  a couple hundred bucks total, maybe
[6804.40s -> 6806.40s]  if you bought every single episode
[6806.40s -> 6812.93s]  on like iTunes. But you don't understand, you're
[6812.93s -> 6814.93s]  saving on the first one.
[6814.93s -> 6816.93s]  $4.95 is a steal.
[6816.93s -> 6821.60s]  It would take ten and a half
[6821.60s -> 6823.84s]  years. Now, for your first three
[6823.84s -> 6825.84s]  episodes, Cheers Video Cassette for $4.95.
[6825.84s -> 6828.34s]  Call now.
[6828.34s -> 6843.49s]  This is the number one
[6843.49s -> 6847.46s]  eight hundred crook's least expensive way to call
[6847.46s -> 6849.95s]  someone collected.
[6868.42s -> 6889.92s]  We need to talk about the first one that we just saw.
[6889.92s -> 6892.93s]  That's perfect.
[6892.93s -> 6894.93s]  Okay.
[6894.93s -> 6896.93s]  Yes. I'm so happy
[6896.93s -> 6899.10s]  right now. Forget everything.
[6899.10s -> 6901.47s]  Everybody freeze. Don't move.
[6901.47s -> 6903.47s]  Nobody move. This is really important.
[6903.47s -> 6907.62s]  I don't want anyone to move.
[6907.62s -> 6911.52s]  Freeze. Okay.
[6911.52s -> 6913.52s]  I'm telling you right now, it's
[6913.52s -> 6915.52s]  impossible not to be, not to enjoy this
[6915.52s -> 6919.86s]  picture.
[6919.86s -> 6922.67s]  I genuinely don't think
[6922.67s -> 6924.67s]  you could not enjoy
[6924.67s -> 6929.60s]  the photo you're about to see. Do you know what I'm saying?
[6929.60s -> 6932.93s]  Do you see what I'm
[6932.93s -> 6939.71s]  saying? You can't
[6939.71s -> 6941.71s]  not enjoy this
[6941.71s -> 6943.71s]  in some fashion. Even if you don't think it's funny,
[6943.71s -> 6946.72s]  like this is an enjoyable image to me.
[6946.72s -> 6950.56s]  It kind of is.
[6950.56s -> 6952.56s]  And the best part is you
[6952.56s -> 6954.56s]  blurred, you blurred the
[6954.56s -> 6957.76s]  price. Because what is that
[6957.76s -> 6959.76s]  price? What?
[6959.76s -> 6961.76s]  It's cheaper now by how much?
[6961.76s -> 6963.76s]  What? I can't see through that blur.
[6963.76s -> 6966.00s]  I wonder what percentage
[6966.00s -> 6969.33s]  point is going down. Oh my
[6969.33s -> 6974.45s]  god. And yeah, it's just question
[6974.45s -> 6981.86s]  marks. God, the internet.
[6981.86s -> 6984.67s]  The internet is like so
[6984.67s -> 6986.67s]  what a fucking insane place.
[6986.67s -> 6989.49s]  What a wild place this
[6989.49s -> 6994.74s]  really is. There's so much funny
[6994.74s -> 6996.74s]  things to see. So many crazy
[6996.74s -> 6998.91s]  things to look at.
[6998.91s -> 7002.30s]  This is insane. The internet is a
[7002.30s -> 7004.54s]  cool place. You should be careful.
[7004.54s -> 7010.18s]  Careful. Make it the stream
[7010.18s -> 7013.63s]  thumbnail? Okay, grandpa.
[7013.63s -> 7022.34s]  Should I do one too?
[7022.34s -> 7038.38s]  No, this is no dick. But this is me
[7038.38s -> 7041.38s]  reacting
[7041.38s -> 7043.38s]  to the video of the
[7043.38s -> 7045.38s]  person reacting to the price cut.
[7045.38s -> 7048.94s]  Okay. Here we go. Ready?
[7048.94s -> 7051.38s]  So I'm watching a video.
[7051.38s -> 7067.94s]  Was that good? That was pretty good, right?
[7067.94s -> 7075.17s]  Go on to the switch screen. No.
[7075.17s -> 7078.94s]  All right. We got to break down
[7078.94s -> 7080.94s]  these last ones we just saw. These are important.
[7080.94s -> 7088.54s]  These are very important.
[7088.54s -> 7091.94s]  The last one was weird because
[7091.94s -> 7093.94s]  it was just three, it was what? Three
[7093.94s -> 7095.94s]  ladies just chugging
[7095.94s -> 7098.82s]  iced tea?
[7098.82s -> 7101.76s]  Was it a contest? I don't know.
[7101.76s -> 7112.26s]  All right. But here's the next part, right?
[7112.26s -> 7114.56s]  We have
[7114.56s -> 7117.12s]  What is this a commercial for? He's
[7117.12s -> 7119.12s]  blowing his breath in this other guy's
[7119.12s -> 7122.00s]  face. Is this for
[7122.00s -> 7124.62s]  gum? Mint?
[7124.62s -> 7128.08s]  You think it's gum? What if it's for like
[7128.08s -> 7130.08s]  a steak and cheese
[7130.08s -> 7132.08s]  or something? Or like a sandwich or something? Yeah.
[7132.08s -> 7134.08s]  I actually don't know. I don't know if it's going to be
[7134.08s -> 7139.63s]  mints. This is a tricky one.
[7139.63s -> 7145.78s]  I actually really don't know what this could be.
[7145.78s -> 7149.17s]  It's probably for mints, right?
[7149.17s -> 7151.17s]  There's no way they would do an ad where he blows
[7151.17s -> 7153.17s]  gross hamburger meat breath in this guy's face,
[7153.17s -> 7158.08s]  right? I don't think so.
[7158.08s -> 7160.08s]  I get a whiff of this. What? What?
[7160.08s -> 7162.90s]  Oh, that's very nice.
[7162.90s -> 7164.90s]  It's like a
[7164.90s -> 7166.90s]  petunia.
[7166.90s -> 7168.90s]  Breath savers with its cool minty core
[7168.90s -> 7170.90s]  gives you the ultimate fresh breath.
[7170.90s -> 7172.90s]  Breath savers. It's not going to be hamburger.
[7172.90s -> 7174.90s]  We're here asking kids how clear stick from clear cells
[7174.90s -> 7176.90s]  is working to prevent their pimples.
[7176.90s -> 7178.90s]  Look at this face. Yeah, it's the stuff
[7178.90s -> 7180.90s]  that feels like it gets under your skin to help stop pimples
[7180.90s -> 7182.90s]  before they stop. Clear cell clear stick and clear
[7182.90s -> 7184.90s]  stick. Those things were intense though.
[7184.90s -> 7186.90s]  You gotta just use it.
[7186.90s -> 7190.99s]  Do you find that life just takes
[7190.99s -> 7194.19s]  your breath away?
[7194.19s -> 7196.19s]  You better get on track.
[7196.19s -> 7198.19s]  Get on track with NordicTrack, the world's best
[7198.19s -> 7200.19s]  aerobic exerciser.
[7200.19s -> 7202.19s]  NordicTrack strengthens your heart and lungs,
[7202.19s -> 7204.19s]  increases your energy, and gets you in shape
[7204.19s -> 7206.19s]  for life's challenges in only 20 minutes,
[7206.19s -> 7208.43s]  three times a week.
[7208.43s -> 7210.43s]  Does daily stress sometimes get to be too much?
[7210.43s -> 7212.86s]  Then get on track with
[7212.86s -> 7214.86s]  NordicTrack. Its patented flywheel
[7214.86s -> 7216.86s]  most accurately simulates
[7216.86s -> 7218.86s]  cross-country skiing for a smooth
[7218.86s -> 7220.86s]  total body workout that's non-join
[7220.86s -> 7223.04s]  and easy on your joints.
[7223.04s -> 7225.04s]  Are you finding it harder and harder to make ends meet?
[7225.04s -> 7227.04s]  Your blood pressure is still too high.
[7227.04s -> 7229.73s]  You need to lose some weight.
[7229.73s -> 7231.97s]  You better get on track.
[7231.97s -> 7233.97s]  Get on track with NordicTrack.
[7233.97s -> 7235.97s]  Research shows NordicTrack burns more calories
[7235.97s -> 7237.97s]  and fat than ordinary exercisers
[7237.97s -> 7239.97s]  and helps control your...
[7239.97s -> 7241.97s]  Is it NPC walking?
[7241.97s -> 7248.88s]  NordicTrack strengthens
[7248.88s -> 7250.88s]  your heart and lungs,
[7250.88s -> 7252.88s]  increases your energy, and gets you in shape
[7252.88s -> 7254.88s]  for life's challenges in only 20 minutes,
[7254.88s -> 7257.12s]  three times a week.
[7257.12s -> 7259.12s]  Does daily stress sometimes get to be too much?
[7259.12s -> 7261.62s]  Then get on track with NordicTrack.
[7261.62s -> 7263.62s]  Its patented flywheel most accurately simulates
[7263.62s -> 7265.98s]  cross-country skiing for a smooth
[7265.98s -> 7268.48s]  total body workout that's non-join
[7268.48s -> 7270.48s]  and easy on your joints.
[7270.48s -> 7272.48s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7272.48s -> 7274.48s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7274.48s -> 7276.48s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7276.48s -> 7278.48s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7278.48s -> 7280.48s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7280.48s -> 7284.06s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7284.06s -> 7288.93s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7288.93s -> 7292.96s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7292.96s -> 7294.96s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7294.96s -> 7296.96s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7296.96s -> 7299.58s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7299.58s -> 7301.58s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7301.58s -> 7303.58s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7303.58s -> 7306.14s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7306.14s -> 7308.14s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7308.14s -> 7310.14s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7310.14s -> 7312.14s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7312.14s -> 7314.14s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7314.14s -> 7316.14s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7316.14s -> 7318.45s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7318.45s -> 7321.57s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7321.57s -> 7323.74s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7323.74s -> 7325.74s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7325.74s -> 7329.44s]  Stressful job. Stressful.
[7329.44s -> 7331.44s]  The doctor then tells this guy
[7331.44s -> 7333.44s]  you need to lose weight
[7333.44s -> 7337.66s]  to reduce your blood pressure.
[7337.66s -> 7343.55s]  It's not the stressful job that might be doing this.
[7343.55s -> 7345.55s]  You need to lose some weight. That's what's wrong.
[7345.55s -> 7348.30s]  Get on track with
[7348.30s -> 7350.30s]  total body workout that's non-jarring
[7350.30s -> 7352.30s]  and easy on your joints.
[7352.30s -> 7354.30s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7354.30s -> 7356.30s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7356.30s -> 7358.30s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7358.30s -> 7360.30s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7360.30s -> 7362.54s]  Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?
[7362.54s -> 7364.98s]  Sometimes get to be too much.
[7364.98s -> 7366.98s]  Then get on track with Nordic Track.

[7386.14s -> 7388.14s]  Research...
[7388.14s -> 7391.47s]  This motherfucker has a referral code.
[7391.47s -> 7395.70s]  That's what's going on.
[7395.70s -> 7397.70s]  Nordic Track burns more calories and fat
[7397.70s -> 7399.70s]  than ordinary exercisers
[7399.70s -> 7401.70s]  and helps control your cholesterol and blood pressure

[7411.70s -> 7413.70s]  That probably would do alright.
[7413.70s -> 7416.26s]  This summer,
[7416.26s -> 7418.50s]  guess who's coming to dinner?
[7418.50s -> 7425.15s]  Ha ha ha ha ha!

[7433.60s -> 7435.60s]  Review Sunday, June 20th.
[7435.60s -> 7437.60s]  Favorite for showtimes.
[7437.60s -> 7442.91s]  That's a good trailer for the movie
[7442.91s -> 7447.46s]  because, like, that's...
[7447.46s -> 7454.74s]  Oh, whatever.

[7457.94s -> 7461.14s]  sensor, best a dad can get.
[7461.14s -> 7466.26s]  Kid buying that?
[7466.26s -> 7468.26s]  Respect.

[7470.26s -> 7472.26s]  of what keeps you drier. Secret's still pH balanced.
[7472.26s -> 7474.26s]  Just works harder.

[7476.26s -> 7478.26s]  Strong enough for a man.

[7483.89s -> 7495.98s]  Make music.
[7495.98s -> 7497.98s]  It's the whole history of rock in one collection.

[7559.20s -> 7574.16s]  What is this?
[7574.16s -> 7580.05s]  Oh, it's Comedy Central.
[7580.05s -> 7582.80s]  Alright, where do we go from here?
[7582.80s -> 7584.80s]  Do you guys want 80s? More 90s?
[7584.80s -> 7587.87s]  I do have a couple of infomercials.
[7587.87s -> 7602.83s]  What do you guys think?
[7602.83s -> 7606.80s]  This one is a combo.
[7606.80s -> 7608.80s]  This one's Christmas commercials from the 80s and 90s.
[7608.80s -> 7613.98s]  This is like a combo.
[7613.98s -> 7615.98s]  This one's very long, but we can skip through it.
[7615.98s -> 7621.36s]  Alright, let's see what we got.
[7621.36s -> 7631.39s]  Queue it up.
[7631.39s -> 7633.89s]  Alright, here we go. This is a combo.
[7633.89s -> 7639.58s]  This, by the way, again, this is mostly
[7639.58s -> 7642.08s]  Christmas commercials.
[7642.08s -> 7645.34s]  This is mostly by the
[7645.34s -> 7647.34s]  kind of 4-3
[7647.34s -> 7649.34s]  thing they got going here.
[7649.34s -> 7655.23s]  Alright, let's see.
[7655.23s -> 7657.23s]  The Christmas ornaments of Hallmark.
[7657.23s -> 7662.93s]  Hallmark ornaments
[7662.93s -> 7664.93s]  aren't ordinary decorations.
[7664.93s -> 7666.93s]  They're special little presents.
[7666.93s -> 7668.93s]  For your family,
[7668.93s -> 7670.93s]  your friend, for yourself.
[7670.93s -> 7672.93s]  Keepsakes that bring back
[7672.93s -> 7674.93s]  warm memories of wonderful people
[7674.93s -> 7676.93s]  and wonderful times.
[7676.93s -> 7678.93s]  You'll find them only at Hallmark,
[7678.93s -> 7680.93s]  and there's more to Christmas than ever before.
[7682.93s -> 7684.93s]  That was cute.
[7702.77s -> 7704.77s]  Alright.
[7704.77s -> 7706.77s]  The young and the restless
[7706.77s -> 7708.77s]  will continue.
[7708.77s -> 7710.77s]  What are they recording?
[7718.77s -> 7720.77s]  What? The fuck?
[7720.77s -> 7722.77s]  Why were they driving?
[7722.77s -> 7724.77s]  Towards a picnic?
[7724.77s -> 7726.77s]  What?
[7732.66s -> 7735.79s]  To save a town in trouble.
[7735.79s -> 7738.16s]  They're driving towards the
[7738.16s -> 7740.78s]  people.
[7740.78s -> 7742.78s]  Why are you driving towards a picnic, then?
[7742.78s -> 7744.78s]  Why are you not going to the hospital?
[7752.62s -> 7754.62s]  One other thing, I know pause, Andy.
[7754.62s -> 7756.62s]  Another thing that's important to remember, though,
[7756.62s -> 7758.62s]  is a lot of these time slots
[7758.62s -> 7762.19s]  were, like,
[7762.19s -> 7764.19s]  seven seconds long.
[7764.19s -> 7766.62s]  How do you put a movie
[7766.62s -> 7768.80s]  trailer in, like,
[7768.80s -> 7773.79s]  four and a half seconds?
[7773.79s -> 7776.22s]  You can't.
[7778.22s -> 7780.22s]  This is C.B.S.
[7780.22s -> 7782.22s]  This is C.B.S.
[7782.22s -> 7784.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7784.46s -> 7786.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7786.46s -> 7788.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7788.46s -> 7790.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7790.46s -> 7792.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7792.46s -> 7794.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7794.46s -> 7796.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7796.46s -> 7798.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7798.46s -> 7800.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7800.46s -> 7802.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7802.46s -> 7804.46s]  This is C.B.S.
[7804.46s -> 7806.46s]  C.B.S.
[7806.46s -> 7808.46s]  C.B.S., C.B.S.
[7808.46s -> 7810.46s]  C.B.S.
[7810.46s -> 7833.12s]  Leaving the
[7833.12s -> 7834.48s]  I want to see that again.
[7834.48s -> 7836.48s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[7836.48s -> 7839.84s]  Oh hi, just keeping up with the Christmas rush here at the 50 off store.
[7839.84s -> 7843.92s]  Now it's that time of year again when everybody's trying to buy nice and save big on fine clothing
[7843.92s -> 7848.80s]  for the family, gift items, and toys. And at the 50 off store, they're saving 50% off everything
[7848.80s -> 7853.04s]  in the store every day. Well you know how we do that. We mark each item with the price you'd pay
[7853.04s -> 7856.72s]  in other stores, and when you check out, we total your purchase using those prices. Then with the
[7856.72s -> 7864.82s]  push of a button, we cut that total right in half. Guys, but they say the price you would pay in
[7864.82s -> 7871.30s]  other stores. Doesn't that mean that they're not marking it up?
[7878.35s -> 7882.75s]  Even Santa loves the savings and you will too. The 50 off store, where your money buys twice
[7882.75s -> 7888.67s]  as much for Christmas. This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. KDBC TV, Channel 4, El Paso.
[7888.67s -> 7897.63s]  That's crazy. I don't know what to say. 50% off store. Your dreams of instant wealth may come

[7929.09s -> 7935.17s]  enjoy another deep-basted butterball turkey. Every slice is juicy. It's very juicy. It's a
[7935.17s -> 7939.81s]  butterball. Fresh or frozen, it's been the perfect holiday recipe for over 30 years.
[7945.18s -> 7951.82s]  This holiday, save an arm and a leg with Pam. Pam no-stick cooking spray makes baking a whole
[7951.82s -> 7957.02s]  lot easier. Pam, because how you cook is as important as what you cook. That's terrifying.
[7959.18s -> 7964.30s]  What's this? Bunny slippers? Of all the last-minute gifts you can buy,
[7964.30s -> 7968.78s]  one's appreciated more than all the rest. Wow. McDonald's gift certificates.
[7972.54s -> 7981.90s]  It's not at all, actually. No, it's not. A gift certificate gift card to McDonald's for Christmas
[7981.90s -> 7990.59s]  is like, that's cool. That's all right. But like, I mean, the slippers were kind of cool.
[7990.59s -> 8006.72s]  They were coupons. Jeremy, you're the McDonald's guy. Yeah, but I mean, it actually is kind of
[8006.72s -> 8017.09s]  cool if you think about it. But I don't know. I'd rather have the slippers. You're a walking
[8017.09s -> 8023.90s]  McDonald's ad. It doesn't mean I'm going to buy McDonald's coupons for somebody for Christmas.
[8028.80s -> 8036.70s]  Maybe like a stocking stuffer. Okay, hold on. This is important. I would not wrap this
[8037.63s -> 8046.53s]  in a big box. That's my issue here. This was wrapped in a big box.
[8046.53s -> 8051.97s]  Making a whole lot easier. Pam, because how you cook is as important as what you cook.
[8052.77s -> 8059.65s]  Hold on here. What's this? Bunny slippers? Of all the last-minute gifts you can buy,
[8059.65s -> 8068.86s]  ones appreciated more than all the rest. That came out of a big box. Cards always go
[8068.86s -> 8077.39s]  on the tree. That's right. Or in the stocking. That's right. You don't wrap in a big box a
[8077.39s -> 8087.90s]  gift card. McDonald's gift certificates. That's my issue. On the tree? That's cute. Like, oh,
[8087.90s -> 8096.91s]  whoa, there it is. Yeah, that's cute. The cold that pains you most at night isn't yours. It's
[8096.91s -> 8103.55s]  your child's. Introducing children's Nyquil with no aspirin, no alcohol. It's the nighttime
[8103.55s -> 8107.55s]  sniffling, sneezing, stuffy head, coughing so your child can rest medicine.
[8112.27s -> 8114.99s]  What was that? Night light will return right after this.
[8125.87s -> 8150.16s]  This tastes awful. Well, at least the videos are pretty good.
[8152.08s -> 8156.90s]  Are you going to bring me my lemon? Well, at least the video-
[8156.90s -> 8166.29s]  I cannot fucking believe. I cannot fucking believe that the Xbox Series S is getting a
[8166.29s -> 8175.23s]  price decrease. This is in no way- Those are pretty good.
[8176.90s -> 8179.78s]  Are you going to bring me my lemon or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?
[8179.78s -> 8187.92s]  From riches, to rags, to romance, to Goldie Hawn, to Russell, Overboard,
[8187.92s -> 8194.16s]  Radio PG. Merry Christmas from MGM. It's a Radio Shack Merry Christmas.
[8194.88s -> 8199.52s]  Wait, mom, everybody wants to say goodbye. My family loves this cordless phone from Radio Shack.
[8199.52s -> 8206.48s]  I got it on sale for just $69.95. I saved $30. It's really convenient. No cord in the way,
[8206.48s -> 8210.80s]  and you can dial out or answer from anywhere in the house. Even redial a last number call with
[8210.88s -> 8214.96s]  one touch. Merry Christmas, mom. Oh, and thanks for the tie.
[8215.92s -> 8218.08s]  The ET-395 cordless phone- Really wanted a cordless coupon.
[8218.08s -> 8221.44s]  Sale price for Christmas only at Radio Shack. You better next Christmas, ma.
[8223.04s -> 8227.28s]  Intelligence has identified a substantial buildup of hostile forces right here in our own backyard,
[8227.28s -> 8230.16s]  and I'm giving you the green light to clean them out. Gentlemen, you're the man.
[8253.02s -> 8260.59s]  You used a light gun? It's a Radio Shack at Radio Shack.
[8260.59s -> 8266.35s]  I saved $60 on this VHS remote-controlled VCR. These two-way bass reflex speakers were half
[8266.35s -> 8270.59s]  price at Radio Shack. This dual-powered calculator with memory was only $8.88,
[8270.59s -> 8275.63s]  and I saved $30 on a cordless phone for the family. Harry, I'm home.
[8275.63s -> 8278.35s]  Just finished our Christmas shopping at Radio Shack.
[8279.71s -> 8282.91s]  The Christmas electronics sale only at Radio Shack.
[8286.99s -> 8290.75s]  This is Bobby the Brain Heenan, and if you people out there have any brains, which I doubt you do,
[8290.75s -> 8295.95s]  you'll watch All American Wrestling on the USA Network, the best in professional wrestling
[8295.95s -> 8302.11s]  with the brain. That kind of reminded me of like a lot of sponsored deliverables.
[8302.11s -> 8307.65s]  It's like, Bobby, Bobby, we got to get you talking about the, you know, the network we're on and
[8308.69s -> 8315.98s]  we're going to go and it's going to be one take. It's just like, here we are,
[8315.98s -> 8330.61s]  this is what we're doing. All right, get me out of here. Bobby the Brain Heenan. I remember all
[8330.61s -> 8362.83s]  those guys. Mom, man, let's go. It's definitely for a video game and it's not going to look
[8362.83s -> 8386.03s]  anything like this. Harold, Harold, can we talk? Harold and I got a beautiful sale at $1.99 a month.
[8386.03s -> 8390.11s]  You know what that means? That means with a normal down payment, I've got a 21 foot hourglass fishing
[8390.11s -> 8394.67s]  boat. You guys want to go fishing. If you guys want a cabin cruiser, look at this cabin cruiser.

[8400.11s -> 8404.91s]  Craft cabin cruiser or the hourglass fishing boat, $1.99 a month is the sale, and we take trades.

[8410.14s -> 8419.39s]  I mean, that was, I like that one. That was, hold on, I'm getting overstimulated. Why was that,
[8419.39s -> 8425.46s]  like, why was that guy playing laser tag in a prison, a maximum security prison complex against
[8425.46s -> 8434.29s]  a bunch of like 13 year olds? That was what it was implying, that they're at this maximum security
[8434.29s -> 8447.39s]  prison. You'll watch all American wrestling. Where is this? This is, okay, this is not a prison.
[8447.39s -> 8453.73s]  He's late for the game and he's walking, now he's in the arena.
[8458.85s -> 8462.37s]  Scary guy prisoner in a maximum security cage.
[8465.49s -> 8466.45s]  Mom, man, let's go.
[8468.93s -> 8483.87s]  So they fight against, like, prisoners? How come some of them get cars?
[8483.87s -> 8511.46s]  The cars has an incredible advantage. Yeah, I've played laser tag before, but
[8512.18s -> 8517.97s]  you don't get to have a car. Oh, it's because the commercial cuts off, okay.

[10376.42s -> 10384.67s]  place at the wrong time. Gibson. Michelle Pfeiffer. Kurt Russell. Tequila Sunrise. Written and
[10384.67s -> 10393.02s]  directed by Robert Towne. Rated R. Oh that's so stupid. That would be an unbelievable commercial

[10480.69s -> 10484.45s]  Buying holiday gifts at department stores could be a waste of money
[10484.45s -> 10490.37s]  because smart shoppers save money at marshals for the same. Dude hold on that was not a hundred.
[10490.37s -> 10495.33s]  That was like a child's drawing of a hundred. This backgammon set is also ten dollars.
[10495.33s -> 10506.80s]  They're both great gifts. That wasn't even close. Buying holiday gifts at department stores
[10506.80s -> 10514.46s]  could be a waste of money. That's not even close. You can't do that to real money? I know but at
[10514.46s -> 10521.95s]  least I mean why is he doing this? I see this shit. I see this shit on like like YouTube videos and
[10521.95s -> 10536.99s]  like TikToks. Why is he doing this? Like because smart shoppers save money at marshals for the
[10536.99s -> 10544.19s]  same brand names. This mock turtleneck sweater is just 17.99 at marshals. This silk blouse 17.99.
[10544.19s -> 10550.83s]  These earrings just 7.99 and this cardigan 22.99. That's a total savings of over 40%
[10550.83s -> 10555.95s]  off department store regular prices. So goodbye department stores and hello marshals. Well that
[10555.95s -> 10560.91s]  was under a hundred dollars right? Like you don't why would you burn that?
[10561.55s -> 10590.10s]  You know we're gonna be there. Don't think twice. Service is part of us. He got in.

[10611.70s -> 10617.86s]  mind that can reason. Something out of control but it's insane. The teacher was murdered at the high
[10617.86s -> 10625.30s]  school to destroy it. Why does the dog look interested in that too? As long as he's with

[10659.79s -> 10665.79s]  were near. It wasn't the decorations of the first magic snowfall. It was the appearance of special
[10665.79s -> 10673.87s]  holiday lockers in every pub and beer hall. Today that tradition lives in America at Coors introducing
[10673.95s -> 10679.87s]  Winterfest. Sucks that this works. So bold, so extravagant. We brew it only for the holidays

[15873.23s -> 15879.31s]  14 days ice drinks at the coffee shop cost about six i like cold brew but the same but what they
[15879.31s -> 15883.95s]  don't show you in this commercial in a quarter call now what they don't show you in this commercial
[15883.95s -> 15891.95s]  is how much kind of a pain in the ass it is because you'll do this it takes like wait what
[15891.95s -> 15901.50s]  did they say 14 days that's a long time cold brew makers are great but yeah you guys saying
[15901.50s -> 15907.02s]  already the issue with it is you do it you brew it and you make the amount of coffee you want
[15907.02s -> 15913.44s]  and then the thing is sitting on the counter and you you drink it and you kind of just go oh this
[15913.44s -> 15921.34s]  is a fucking mess and then you have to untake the thing apart clean it throw the grounds away wash
[15921.42s -> 15928.32s]  the thing grounds are everywhere it's kind of annoying it's really good though it's worth it
[15928.32s -> 15938.00s]  if you really like cold brew but col a lot of cold brew machines are cold brew makers i wish
[15938.00s -> 15946.30s]  there was just a better way right you're lazy yeah do you understand welcome welcome to the future
[15946.30s -> 15954.45s]  here every single product you have ever touched has been born out of laziness almost every consumer
[15954.45s -> 15965.34s]  product you've ever used everything is born out of human laziness so yeah i don't feel like spending
[15965.34s -> 15972.64s]  the the like 18 minutes it requires to clean the coffee machine no i don't want to i'm a lazy
[15973.20s -> 15989.44s]  modern human i want it done for me and i want it to be less than a minute for me to do get the
[15989.44s -> 15996.08s]  amazing spinning cool cafe for only 29.99 yeah 30 bucks guaranteed to cold brew the best iced

[16019.95s -> 16026.70s]  put coffee grounds into cold water put it in the fridge for eight to 15 hours or so 10 hours 14
[16026.70s -> 16034.50s]  hours that's all it is i mean it separates the grounds it makes it i don't know whatever
[16034.50s -> 16044.10s]  a hundred dollar value 14 days i don't know if i'm one to talk because i feel like i've
[16044.10s -> 16050.98s]  put cold brew in the fridge and drank it like a week or two later i feel like i have done that
[16050.98s -> 16059.98s]  like oh yeah this is still fine i've been like i don't know it's fine it's coffee it's enough
[16059.98s -> 16073.46s]  poison that explains a lot not two weeks but i don't know four or five six days few days five
[16073.46s -> 16080.67s]  days how long i've probably done it before coffee literally never goes bad no matter how you make it
[16080.67s -> 16089.39s]  well i don't know does it mold brew yeah it strengthens the gut biome
[16091.73s -> 16104.58s]  all right that's it that's all for today that was fun there's only four and a half hours i think is
[16104.58s -> 16110.02s]  my limit watching watching like two lord of the rings movies worth of old ads is i think is enough
[16110.02s -> 16131.36s]  for my brain that was really fun that was very very very wild yeah all right so what do you guys
[16131.36s -> 16137.49s]  think you guys want more of this i don't want to overdo it though because i feel like it loses the
[16137.49s -> 16150.75s]  magic i think it's a lot of fun it's cool to look at kind of the way the world functioned and the
[16150.75s -> 16158.69s]  technology at the time and what people thought was interesting and it's cool please watch biodome
[16158.69s -> 16169.34s]  i mean i i don't think i can do that but i'll ask do mobile game ads i've actually wanted to
[16169.34s -> 16180.80s]  do that for a while but all right um so the plan was i was going to play driver tomorrow
[16180.80s -> 16185.95s]  but i do have some very bad news i'm not going to be playing driver tomorrow and he's a little i
[16185.95s -> 16190.29s]  need to set it up he's a little more time to set up but that's not what's happening we're not doing
[16190.29s -> 16213.52s]  that sorry so that's shocking do british ads i would i'll do that is it just as simple as looking
[16213.52s -> 16224.99s]  up uh 90s british ads and the same amount of compilations i'm imagining two canadian ones
[16227.14s -> 16246.69s]  you want me to be a commercial react andy i could do that the uk is so boring i mean i i don't think
[16246.69s -> 16250.69s]  there's probably tons of interesting stuff that came out in the uk for ads
[16259.71s -> 16267.52s]  yeah all right so here's the plan um i'm kind of doing this like one day off one day on one day
[16268.32s -> 16276.13s]  off one day on thing so the next time you see me i'll be here on sunday with hopefully driver and
[16276.13s -> 16285.39s]  probably something else i'm not i am not gonna beat driver i don't think so i'll be lucky to
[16285.39s -> 16298.75s]  get 30 40 minutes out of that game yeah frog detective makes sense depends on if i get obsessed
[16298.75s -> 16310.51s]  with driver i doubt it but you know weirder things have happened on this stream yeah same deal uh i
[16310.51s -> 16313.71s]  sus is going to be set for two don't be surprised if it happens earlier
[16314.43s -> 16322.16s]  2023 i'm trying to keep myself more honest on when i start so if it says two it could be two
