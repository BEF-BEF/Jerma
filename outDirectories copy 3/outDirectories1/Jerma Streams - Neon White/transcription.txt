[18.23s -> 19.43s]  I am back.
[24.08s -> 26.88s]  So this is a fast-paced moving shooter.
[28.35s -> 29.75s]  This is not a controller game, right?
[33.02s -> 34.02s]  What about viewfinder?
[35.73s -> 36.33s]  Yeah, that's true.
[42.01s -> 42.81s]  Yeah, that's true.
[44.32s -> 45.22s]  I already got it open though.
[48.20s -> 49.00s]  It's a Guggerda game.
[52.42s -> 54.53s]  I, I like Guggerda games.
[60.38s -> 62.48s]  All right, let me make sure this is good to go.
[64.15s -> 64.85s]  Should be.
[68.84s -> 69.64s]  Capture this.
[76.82s -> 78.72s]  I need to capture a game.
[80.00s -> 81.70s]  I would like to capture a game.
[81.70s -> 82.80s]  That'd be great.
[85.82s -> 87.12s]  How high should my sensitivity be?
[95.39s -> 95.79s]  Dude.
[95.89s -> 102.41s]  All right.
[102.41s -> 102.91s]  It looks good.
[103.11s -> 103.51s]  Let's go.
[107.19s -> 107.79s]  Is there a cutscene?
[108.69s -> 109.09s]  Probably.
[112.36s -> 113.36s]  Did I just skip the cutscene?
[114.98s -> 115.48s]  I didn't mean to.
[115.48s -> 117.28s]  Should have known it was going to end this way.
[119.66s -> 120.46s]  Did I skip the cutscene?
[122.16s -> 124.26s]  God's sick sense of humor or something.
[127.08s -> 129.38s]  People like me don't get second chances.
[130.76s -> 134.53s]  If I did, I swear.
[134.53s -> 136.33s]  I can't believe there are 10 Winnie the Pooh movies.
[136.33s -> 139.53s]  I'm so mad about that because I've never won the million in that game.
[140.10s -> 141.20s]  I'm just never going to be allowed to.
[141.30s -> 142.50s]  I'm just never going to be allowed to get it.
[148.48s -> 150.28s]  I shook my head the whole time I was peeing.
[150.58s -> 151.38s]  There's no way.
[154.37s -> 156.47s]  I swear I was just in the middle of something.
[156.77s -> 158.79s]  Remember a thing though.
[159.39s -> 160.39s]  Where the heck am I?
[160.59s -> 162.79s]  Do I know these people?
[168.75s -> 170.55s]  That's what's going to happen in about five seconds.
[171.23s -> 177.53s]  Neons rejoice for you've arrived in glorious heaven.
[177.63s -> 177.93s]  What?
[178.83s -> 183.03s]  We are the believers agents of God.
[185.40s -> 187.20s]  Okay, can one of the mods change the title?
[188.39s -> 190.09s]  Because that does not make sense for neon white.
[190.39s -> 196.59s]  And you dead mortals are what we refer to as neons sinners.
[196.59s -> 199.29s]  The goddess judged most unfavorably.
[199.39s -> 199.79s]  Okay.
[200.49s -> 203.29s]  Wait, am I meant to be in hell?
[204.25s -> 208.95s]  But fret not for we have granted you an opportunity for salvation in
[208.95s -> 210.45s]  our annual competition.
[210.65s -> 219.47s]  The 10 days keep it during these 10 days you neons will use your
[219.67s -> 225.37s]  villainous talents to annihilate the demons invading our Holy Land.
[226.82s -> 228.72s]  Okay, I think I can handle that.
[228.72s -> 229.32s]  This is for real.
[230.68s -> 231.78s]  Hey, guess what?
[231.88s -> 233.78s]  You died and God thinks you suck.
[234.08s -> 235.28s]  Go kill some crap.
[236.63s -> 236.93s]  That's me.
[236.93s -> 237.33s]  That's me.
[240.06s -> 242.66s]  You will each receive a soul card containing a weapon.
[242.66s -> 243.46s]  I'm that character.
[243.46s -> 244.26s]  I'm that character.
[252.46s -> 253.36s]  Tana soul card.
[254.80s -> 256.90s]  Soul card with a melee slash attack.
[256.90s -> 258.30s]  It cannot be discarded.
[258.80s -> 261.70s]  Attach note reads according to our records fights.
[261.70s -> 265.70s]  Ideal weapon is a totally sick Samurai sword.
[266.10s -> 270.10s]  The most competent Demon Slayer will receive the ultimate reward.
[270.60s -> 270.90s]  That's me.
[270.90s -> 271.30s]  That's me.
[272.30s -> 275.70s]  I'm very own place in what the fuck?
[275.70s -> 276.70s]  No, I want to be that character.
[276.70s -> 277.70s]  That's not like you at all.
[277.70s -> 279.80s]  You don't you don't act like that guy did.
[279.80s -> 280.10s]  That's me.
[280.40s -> 281.10s]  You can be the other one.
[281.10s -> 282.90s]  You can be like this like boss character or something.
[283.40s -> 289.29s]  But first some housekeeping.
[303.45s -> 303.85s]  That's me.
[312.09s -> 319.05s]  Aeon white do not forget you are here in heaven as guests.
[319.95s -> 323.55s]  These masks don't mean an explosive that we won't hesitate to
[323.55s -> 326.55s]  detonate if you step out of line.
[330.26s -> 333.56s]  And I guess I'm going to please refrain from removing them.
[333.76s -> 337.06s]  Unless of course you'd prefer to go out in flames.
[344.08s -> 344.68s]  Yeesh.
[345.18s -> 347.88s]  I guess lowly sinner shouldn't expect red carpet treatment.
[348.48s -> 354.39s]  But heaven kind of seems like a racket and yet forgiveness
[355.09s -> 359.39s]  strangely compelling to me like every inch of my body is calling
[359.39s -> 360.09s]  out for it.
[360.69s -> 363.09s]  It's almost painful voice act along.
[363.09s -> 364.39s]  That's that's what we're doing.
[364.39s -> 365.99s]  Who exactly did I used to be?
[367.86s -> 374.66s]  Now then go forth catch your boat at the glassport and kill
[374.66s -> 378.06s]  every demon you find will be counting.
[378.36s -> 382.33s]  All right, demons soul cards.
[382.33s -> 386.93s]  No sweat memories might be hazy, but I don't need a tutorial
[386.93s -> 387.93s]  on how to kick ass.
[387.93s -> 390.43s]  They are going to do a tutorial, right?
[390.43s -> 392.43s]  Love tutorials.
[394.78s -> 395.78s]  Okay, movement.
[397.38s -> 397.88s]  Sure.
[400.08s -> 410.93s]  W S A D it's W A S D use me way way way too hard.
[411.73s -> 412.43s]  Way too much.
[415.02s -> 419.32s]  I'm going to go with 30 and then how's the FOV should I be
[419.32s -> 421.72s]  a hundred or too much is 95.
[421.72s -> 429.05s]  All right, find out a little too low.
[430.37s -> 431.27s]  Looks really cool.
[432.04s -> 433.24s]  They like point 40.
[437.86s -> 438.96s]  Okay, what am I looking at here?
[442.13s -> 442.83s]  Is there a double jump?
[442.83s -> 443.93s]  There's a glide.
[444.43s -> 445.53s]  Oh, this is very pretty.
[450.35s -> 451.35s]  I have ammo for this.
[452.34s -> 457.67s]  Oh, now what?
[458.57s -> 470.49s]  Oh, you can walk in this jumping to your bunny hopping.
[470.49s -> 471.29s]  Is it be hopping?
[474.19s -> 483.30s]  Not really music's too loud.
[484.72s -> 485.22s]  I got you.
[486.09s -> 486.59s]  I got you.
[498.06s -> 498.56s]  That's all right.
[499.52s -> 500.42s]  I think that's a little bit better.
[513.90s -> 514.60s]  You did it.
[515.28s -> 518.48s]  You got a bronze medal bronze medal unlock insight level
[518.48s -> 521.68s]  one unlock for this level gifts findable.
[527.07s -> 532.93s]  Okay, press restart.
[532.93s -> 534.53s]  Wait, you can just quick restart.
[536.64s -> 537.84s]  Okay, that's a quick restart.
[538.74s -> 540.94s]  There are seven demons.
[547.58s -> 550.58s]  Terrify card fires like a machine gun.
[555.72s -> 557.22s]  Swap cards with Q.
[557.22s -> 559.42s]  I think I want to change that to a different button, but start
[559.42s -> 560.02s]  like this.
[562.98s -> 565.08s]  There's sprint or anything or am I just always sprinting?
[569.00s -> 570.53s]  Oh, what's next?
[572.90s -> 579.75s]  I level to nice TF to aim.
[580.62s -> 581.42s]  I was at an insult.
[590.04s -> 590.74s]  Okay, I get it.
[603.51s -> 604.31s]  That's pretty fast.
[605.18s -> 605.98s]  I'll take it.
[618.12s -> 619.12s]  Your voice is annoying.
[619.12s -> 621.22s]  You should mute your mic must have been a real hardcore.
[622.92s -> 625.04s]  It's me yellow.
[625.14s -> 626.04s]  You're annoying.
[626.04s -> 626.74s]  How's that sound?
[627.04s -> 628.44s]  It has been a minute.
[629.82s -> 630.72s]  Neon yellow.
[634.09s -> 638.29s]  This guy even with a mask on I recognize him from earlier.
[639.19s -> 642.29s]  Tell I know him just vaguely.
[642.39s -> 642.89s]  That's me.
[643.09s -> 643.89s]  Holy crap.
[643.89s -> 645.69s]  You got the freaking anime sword.
[645.69s -> 647.99s]  I thought for sure you'd get one of those little guns like
[647.99s -> 652.89s]  the oh should have to turn the page.
[652.89s -> 653.39s]  Sorry.
[653.39s -> 653.99s]  Everyone's waiting.
[653.99s -> 655.49s]  What's it called like gnomes use?
[655.49s -> 659.36s]  Gnomes.
[664.11s -> 665.81s]  I know you're a badass.
[669.42s -> 672.82s]  Hell doesn't idiot like this seem to remember me perfectly.
[672.82s -> 674.52s]  I'm not gonna skip all the dialogue.
[674.52s -> 676.82s]  But no, we need I'm gonna know what's going on.
[676.82s -> 677.62s]  Okay, man.
[678.82s -> 680.42s]  No, for real.
[680.82s -> 682.52s]  We rolled together for years, bro.
[682.62s -> 684.52s]  Got off to some crazy stuff.
[685.62s -> 687.32s]  You're my sass game, man.
[687.42s -> 688.72s]  The darkness to my light.
[689.22s -> 692.22s]  You know, I saved your life once took a bullet for you, dude.
[692.92s -> 693.42s]  Really?
[694.02s -> 695.32s]  Nah, I'm just messing.
[699.24s -> 699.94s]  I'm not skipping.
[699.94s -> 701.14s]  I'm not skipping anything.
[704.54s -> 705.04s]  Yeah.
[705.64s -> 706.14s]  All right.
[707.83s -> 711.03s]  Seriously, dude, we should team up just like old times.
[712.23s -> 715.13s]  Then I can save you for real from those like demon freaks
[715.13s -> 715.73s]  or something.
[716.23s -> 716.73s]  Yeah.
[717.73s -> 719.13s]  Appreciate the offer.
[719.33s -> 720.23s]  But no, thanks.
[720.63s -> 721.43s]  I work alone.
[721.63s -> 722.83s]  Don't shush shush.
[723.23s -> 724.03s]  Don't shush me.
[724.23s -> 724.83s]  Don't tweet at me.
[724.83s -> 725.63s]  Don't shush me.
[729.03s -> 731.63s]  Like my favorite line from a from a TV show.
[732.53s -> 733.73s]  It could be one of my favorite lines.
[736.11s -> 736.71s]  Don't shush me.
[736.71s -> 737.51s]  Don't tweet me.
[738.87s -> 740.97s]  Just there's so much going on in that sentence.
[740.97s -> 741.57s]  I love it.
[746.09s -> 746.49s]  Sure.
[747.09s -> 749.63s]  Good meeting you.
[753.64s -> 754.14s]  Let's go.
[755.98s -> 757.78s]  This is a pistol.
[759.58s -> 764.22s]  This card ability triggers a second jump right midair.
[765.88s -> 766.98s]  How do I discard a card?
[768.56s -> 774.62s]  Oh, can I have another one of those?
[787.16s -> 788.76s]  Do I only have to have one bullet for it to work?
[789.70s -> 790.40s]  Oh, I see.
[790.40s -> 791.40s]  Okay, you have to collect them.
[791.40s -> 793.10s]  Whoa, that's okay.
[794.30s -> 795.00s]  I get it now.
[806.91s -> 807.41s]  Cool.
[808.64s -> 809.24s]  Cleared it.
[809.34s -> 809.64s]  Oh shit.
[809.64s -> 810.94s]  He's playing a real game.
[812.42s -> 812.82s]  It's a good.
[812.82s -> 813.32s]  It's it.
[813.32s -> 813.62s]  Yeah.
[820.89s -> 821.29s]  Yes.
[834.38s -> 835.58s]  Is this as fast as I can go?
[835.88s -> 836.68s]  I'm assuming.
[836.68s -> 837.08s]  Yes.
[841.57s -> 842.87s]  Didn't even break a sweat.
[842.87s -> 846.19s]  No, I can go even faster than that.
[846.19s -> 846.59s]  Technically.
[846.59s -> 847.59s]  No, not even close.
[850.88s -> 851.58s]  Rank up.
[861.61s -> 863.01s]  I ironically like this game.
[863.01s -> 864.11s]  I mean the game seems fun.
[866.18s -> 868.38s]  Jump on a balloon demon to kill it and bounce into the air.
[876.16s -> 878.66s]  And with a double jump, that would be pretty cool.
[887.86s -> 890.16s]  Oh, I blew it.
[895.13s -> 895.63s]  Here we go.
[907.06s -> 907.96s]  I got to save this.
[925.31s -> 926.81s]  Oh, there's still a demon left.
[926.91s -> 927.71s]  Oh shit.
[927.71s -> 928.01s]  Okay.
[928.01s -> 928.41s]  Hold on.
[930.22s -> 933.12s]  I need to I don't like you being the button to press.
[936.27s -> 953.10s]  I want to be like mouse for like a little too.
[953.10s -> 953.30s]  All right.
[953.30s -> 953.80s]  All right.
[953.90s -> 954.50s]  This game is fun.
[955.20s -> 956.40s]  Oh, just one more try.
[956.40s -> 957.40s]  Just one more try.
[957.40s -> 959.60s]  It really hits you with that one more try.
[986.20s -> 986.70s]  There we go.
[988.81s -> 990.41s]  Yeah, gold medal.
[990.41s -> 991.21s]  Gold medal.
[991.41s -> 991.71s]  Yeah.
[991.81s -> 992.21s]  Yeah.
[992.31s -> 992.61s]  Yeah.
[997.72s -> 998.72s]  Gift collectible.
[1002.89s -> 1004.09s]  This is just the tutorial.
[1008.04s -> 1011.24s]  Okay, is that the alt girl I saw from earlier?
[1013.80s -> 1016.10s]  Hey, mind letting go of my shirt.
[1017.94s -> 1020.94s]  There was this huge demon chasing after me.
[1021.91s -> 1022.41s]  Where?
[1023.11s -> 1023.71s]  Where is it?
[1024.21s -> 1025.71s]  Looks like I lost it.
[1026.71s -> 1027.71s]  It was wrong music.
[1027.71s -> 1031.61s]  You'd protect me if it came back though, right?
[1033.04s -> 1034.24s]  No, sorry.
[1034.44s -> 1035.64s]  I got a boat to catch.
[1036.04s -> 1037.04s]  You're on your own kid.
[1040.09s -> 1043.59s]  You know how I feel about being called kid white.
[1043.99s -> 1048.49s]  I actually don't remember amnesia side effect of dying.
[1048.49s -> 1050.29s]  It seems to voice Andy.
[1051.79s -> 1053.49s]  Seriously, really good.
[1053.49s -> 1054.09s]  Aren't they?
[1054.49s -> 1055.29s]  I got this one.
[1055.59s -> 1057.99s]  I've got this one on lockdown.
[1057.99s -> 1058.59s]  You know what I mean?
[1059.85s -> 1062.95s]  I'll find me somebody that could do this better than me.
[1064.94s -> 1066.34s]  You won't be able to find it.
[1066.54s -> 1067.04s]  You're not.
[1067.04s -> 1067.94s]  I don't think so.
[1068.04s -> 1069.94s]  I've lost some memories too.
[1071.96s -> 1076.26s]  Like I can't even remember how to use a gun which makes this
[1076.26s -> 1078.96s]  whole situation extra scary.
[1081.34s -> 1081.94s]  You will bury.
[1081.94s -> 1083.04s]  No, no, no.
[1083.04s -> 1084.74s]  Bugleberry is more like this.
[1085.97s -> 1089.97s]  You'd like to know where the bugleberry voice comes from.
[1089.97s -> 1093.57s]  It's very easy to tell you although maybe it should be sort
[1093.57s -> 1096.37s]  of a mystery and tell you everything.
[1112.38s -> 1112.88s]  Yes.
[1113.48s -> 1116.68s]  Yes, the inspiration for bugleberry's voice is none other
[1116.68s -> 1119.48s]  than our favorite cartoon character Captain Crunch.
[1121.06s -> 1122.76s]  My cabin crunch cereal.
[1129.37s -> 1130.57s]  A little bit of inspiration there.
[1130.57s -> 1135.16s]  I think there's a lower bomb right there.
[1139.47s -> 1139.97s]  It's a few.
[1139.97s -> 1141.37s]  It's a few different people.
[1141.77s -> 1147.17s]  It's a few different people but bugleberry is like 33%
[1147.17s -> 1147.87s]  Captain Crunch.
[1149.48s -> 1150.28s]  I don't know.
[1150.68s -> 1152.08s]  I should probably get going.
[1153.08s -> 1159.00s]  You wouldn't really abandon a cute girl like me, would you?
[1163.64s -> 1167.64s]  I know you don't remember but you were once a great teacher.
[1168.44s -> 1171.40s]  Mr.
[1171.40s -> 1177.10s]  White I I was well, okay.
[1177.10s -> 1178.00s]  Fine.
[1178.30s -> 1179.60s]  I can spare a second.
[1179.60s -> 1186.22s]  I guess you want to bend your knees a bit arms extended not
[1186.22s -> 1186.72s]  locked.
[1188.12s -> 1189.92s]  Is this good?
[1192.88s -> 1195.18s]  Yeah, but keep it steady.
[1195.98s -> 1199.48s]  You should use both hands and fill any open spaces on the
[1199.48s -> 1200.48s]  grip with your fingers.
[1205.05s -> 1208.35s]  There's something kind of exhilarating about this, huh?
[1208.35s -> 1208.75s]  Mr.
[1208.75s -> 1209.25s]  White.
[1209.55s -> 1213.05s]  I'm just looking through the chat and just seeing just the
[1213.05s -> 1216.05s]  people the people that are not they're not even participating
[1216.05s -> 1216.55s]  in the chat.
[1220.25s -> 1224.65s]  Cold hard metal in my hands that hint of danger.
[1224.65s -> 1227.15s]  Like you made you probably the game is probably muted.
[1227.85s -> 1230.65s]  You probably have no video on you just talking about what
[1230.65s -> 1231.65s]  you had for dinner today.
[1233.84s -> 1236.54s]  Anyway, like this.
[1242.05s -> 1243.05s]  Holy crap.
[1243.74s -> 1245.14s]  Are you sure you forgot?
[1248.65s -> 1250.05s]  I was so much fun.
[1250.25s -> 1251.05s]  Thanks white.
[1251.05s -> 1252.71s]  I owe you big.
[1252.81s -> 1257.71s]  Well, you know, it's like you said I'm a great teacher.
[1258.71s -> 1259.81s]  Just did the thing with space.
[1260.31s -> 1261.31s]  It's violet.
[1261.41s -> 1263.11s]  Don't go forgetting this time.
[1266.91s -> 1268.21s]  Neon violet.
[1272.47s -> 1273.27s]  Violet, huh?
[1274.04s -> 1275.64s]  Here girl shoot.
[1277.34s -> 1279.07s]  All right, it's time.
[1279.07s -> 1282.68s]  Let's uh-huh.
[1283.58s -> 1287.28s]  Purify bombs destroy red breakable walls.
[1287.38s -> 1292.45s]  So did I do that right?
[1292.65s -> 1293.15s]  This work.
[1294.15s -> 1298.63s]  Oh great groups of enemies.
[1300.28s -> 1301.18s]  It takes about a second.
[1309.82s -> 1310.62s]  Not bad.
[1316.90s -> 1317.90s]  Am I grandma keeps that?
[1317.90s -> 1323.06s]  No, I think we I think we've answered enough my grandmother
[1323.06s -> 1326.36s]  asked this question questions for it to last us a few years.
[1326.36s -> 1338.50s]  I think stand near the so you can like rocket jump to give
[1338.50s -> 1340.10s]  you forward momentum to I'm imagining.
[1340.10s -> 1340.50s]  Yes.
[1346.90s -> 1364.89s]  Yeah, Captain Crunch sounds nothing like bugleberry.
[1365.79s -> 1367.79s]  Well, that's why I said it was inspiration.
[1367.79s -> 1370.79s]  It wasn't necessarily a one-to-one impression.
[1381.14s -> 1396.92s]  Is there a boss at the end of this again?
[1400.28s -> 1401.88s]  I didn't mean it didn't want to do that.
[1413.15s -> 1413.95s]  I must have missed it.
[1441.39s -> 1441.69s]  Yeah.
[1441.79s -> 1444.02s]  Yeah, I'm just getting started.
[1444.12s -> 1444.92s]  The bronze medal.
[1454.93s -> 1456.03s]  Nineteen demons.
[1464.06s -> 1464.36s]  Okay.
[1464.36s -> 1465.06s]  Well, I'm fine.
[1472.27s -> 1472.77s]  What the hell?
[1473.37s -> 1473.97s]  Oh, it's health.
[1501.88s -> 1524.13s]  That's how we use the environment bronze bronze is the best no
[1524.13s -> 1525.03s]  expectations.
[1527.06s -> 1529.76s]  You're not in you're not in second place because in second place
[1529.76s -> 1530.66s]  you would feel like damn.
[1530.66s -> 1532.16s]  I wish it was first place easy.
[1532.26s -> 1536.13s]  You just get awarded for being cool, but there's no pressure
[1536.13s -> 1536.83s]  of second place.
[1536.83s -> 1538.63s]  You wish you were first is no pressure first place.
[1538.63s -> 1541.97s]  Give me bronze all day behind you.
[1542.74s -> 1551.72s]  I do that again.
[1551.72s -> 1553.12s]  Somebody and the channel.
[1554.09s -> 1556.69s]  I don't know if mods can do that or not, but demons zero red
[1556.69s -> 1565.51s]  a hundred and the channel if it happens again long time no
[1565.51s -> 1575.46s]  see white neon red nice heard from before this girl is you
[1575.46s -> 1581.20s]  staring quick say something cool white that is massive
[1581.20s -> 1587.14s]  rifle want to taste that's okay.
[1587.94s -> 1590.44s]  Seriously, please don't point that thing at me.
[1590.54s -> 1593.94s]  Would you realize that this is the least effective way for
[1593.94s -> 1598.74s]  you to get me here because barrels very long and the target
[1598.74s -> 1599.84s]  here is now very small.
[1599.84s -> 1602.94s]  So now if I go I dodge my shoulder grab the barrel push
[1602.94s -> 1608.68s]  it over then we're this is this is a problem for you now relax.
[1608.88s -> 1610.38s]  I just like to see you sweat.
[1614.79s -> 1615.79s]  Okay, John.
[1615.79s -> 1618.59s]  In that case you should watch me wipe the floor with demons
[1618.59s -> 1619.29s]  sometime.
[1621.57s -> 1623.97s]  Yeah, I've seen a lifetime of that kind of thing.
[1627.36s -> 1630.56s]  You know, this is actually the first time I've seen you here
[1631.06s -> 1631.96s]  in the competition.
[1631.96s -> 1635.56s]  I mean makes me wonder do you think this will end for us the
[1635.56s -> 1636.56s]  way it did in life?
[1637.36s -> 1641.86s]  See, I'd love to answer that but I woke up with no memories
[1641.86s -> 1642.46s]  of life.
[1643.16s -> 1644.76s]  Not that I don't recognize you.
[1645.46s -> 1650.24s]  It's just the details are fuzzy so far though.
[1650.44s -> 1652.54s]  I feel the strongest connection to you.
[1655.12s -> 1655.92s]  Damn it white.
[1656.52s -> 1660.72s]  Why would you say something so lame to a girl how bizarre?
[1661.12s -> 1663.32s]  I've never heard of a neon with such an affliction.
[1665.98s -> 1666.68s]  Messing with me.
[1666.68s -> 1670.29s]  Are you I have no reason to lie to you.
[1672.41s -> 1673.61s]  Is that so?
[1677.13s -> 1679.93s]  Can't believe God himself decided to bless me with the
[1679.93s -> 1680.23s]  thing.
[1680.23s -> 1684.33s]  I love most a completely clueless boy.
[1685.03s -> 1686.63s]  This isn't fun for me, you know.
[1688.33s -> 1689.63s]  Well, it is for me.
[1690.23s -> 1692.53s]  We could have been lovers in life and you'd be none the
[1692.53s -> 1696.06s]  wiser lovers.
[1697.90s -> 1702.10s]  I could know every last one of your measurements.
[1703.30s -> 1704.60s]  Be serious here.
[1704.90s -> 1706.60s]  You've got a long boat right ahead.
[1707.10s -> 1709.60s]  Maybe you could fill me in on the details of my character
[1710.00s -> 1712.07s]  or even your relationship to me.
[1714.03s -> 1718.23s]  I don't know why honestly, it's probably easier this way
[1718.83s -> 1719.83s]  for both of us.
[1721.20s -> 1725.20s]  What are you going?
[1729.64s -> 1731.34s]  All aboard the ship.
[1731.54s -> 1732.74s]  I thought that was us for a second.
[1733.94s -> 1737.04s]  Strugglers will be returned to oblivion.
[1739.26s -> 1742.06s]  Yes, don't think I made it this far last time.
[1745.46s -> 1747.26s]  This really is my first roadie.
[1747.26s -> 1749.06s]  What happens if I press half bad?
[1750.80s -> 1753.00s]  Looks like that's what happens.
[1754.95s -> 1756.35s]  Bad for a dead guy, huh?
[1758.55s -> 1760.65s]  I feel like we missed something really important.
[1762.46s -> 1764.66s]  I thought it was going to be fast-forward and it was going to be
[1764.66s -> 1768.86s]  like, I thought it was going to be funny, but exactly what I
[1768.86s -> 1769.66s]  expected.
[1770.26s -> 1777.00s]  Why am I so disappointed?
[1779.56s -> 1782.26s]  Want to walk to the Believer's Sermon together?
[1782.46s -> 1784.26s]  I want to fight, I want to fight demons.
[1784.46s -> 1786.26s]  Yo, bro, you made it.
[1788.40s -> 1789.80s]  Kick a lot of demon ass.
[1790.40s -> 1790.80s]  Yes.
[1791.60s -> 1792.70s]  Like it was nothing.
[1793.60s -> 1797.10s]  I'm telling you bro, with our like combined powers, those
[1797.10s -> 1798.40s]  demons are donezo.
[1800.60s -> 1802.10s]  Wait, do we play together?
[1802.50s -> 1803.30s]  Do we switch characters?
[1803.30s -> 1806.00s]  Oh snap, Violet, is that you?
[1806.30s -> 1807.70s]  This is crazy.
[1809.28s -> 1810.78s]  It's like the gang's all here.
[1810.88s -> 1811.78s]  I'm sorry.
[1811.88s -> 1813.28s]  Do I know you?
[1813.38s -> 1815.48s]  Are we all mutuals here?
[1815.78s -> 1816.48s]  Yeah, man.
[1816.68s -> 1818.78s]  Violet was our crew's littlest badass.
[1818.78s -> 1821.48s]  Like this one time I read her diary and she had written this
[1821.48s -> 1823.58s]  crazy fanfic about her and the bot.
[1826.07s -> 1827.67s]  What happened to this guy?
[1829.99s -> 1831.49s]  Oh, that was the I'm done.
[1831.49s -> 1831.89s]  Okay.
[1832.39s -> 1833.39s]  Let me tell you something here.
[1833.89s -> 1835.89s]  So that was the I'm done talking.
[1835.89s -> 1837.49s]  My dialogue cuts off here.
[1837.59s -> 1838.69s]  There is a hyphen.
[1838.99s -> 1840.79s]  Somebody needs to interrupt me.
[1841.09s -> 1844.99s]  What happens a lot of the time is the person will say the
[1844.99s -> 1849.49s]  line with the hyphen there and they'll stop.
[1849.49s -> 1852.09s]  So to be like, oh you and me.
[1852.99s -> 1854.89s]  Oh yeah, and you get cut off now.
[1855.89s -> 1857.89s]  So how you do that and you make that work a little better
[1858.69s -> 1860.59s]  is you just hold the hold it at the end.
[1860.89s -> 1862.39s]  Are you hold that last line?
[1862.79s -> 1866.99s]  Like we were supposed to be going to the grocery.
[1866.99s -> 1869.39s]  Oh, then I'll give me that opportunity to cut me off.
[1871.52s -> 1872.52s]  No one cares.
[1874.12s -> 1876.02s]  This is an acting class out of where the where the hell did
[1876.02s -> 1876.72s]  you think you were?
[1878.30s -> 1879.70s]  This is like a live streamer.
[1879.70s -> 1880.40s]  I play video games.
[1880.40s -> 1882.60s]  No, I'm teaching you acting skills.
[1885.02s -> 1886.12s]  I don't know what you think this is.
[1895.18s -> 1896.68s]  They may be freaks, but
[1897.78s -> 1898.38s]  all right, cool.
[1901.99s -> 1904.49s]  Welcome to Central Heaven.
[1904.79s -> 1908.79s]  It is an honor for your kind to bask in its beauty.

[1918.39s -> 1922.19s]  alone population always spirals out of control this time of
[1922.19s -> 1922.69s]  year.
[1924.53s -> 1929.43s]  It's onerous work, but the possibility of redemption is
[1929.43s -> 1930.93s]  well worth the effort.
[1931.03s -> 1934.83s]  Is it not and on that note we'd like to introduce last
[1934.83s -> 1939.33s]  year's winner of the 10 defending his crown is the vicious
[1939.53s -> 1939.93s]  Hulk.

[1942.63s -> 1943.83s]  to be and now it's like all of a sudden.

[1947.63s -> 1948.63s]  Don't skip please.
[1948.73s -> 1953.24s]  Why does it feel like he's staring directly at me?
[1954.04s -> 1961.62s]  Why do I feel so angry greens demons slaying prowess has
[1961.62s -> 1965.92s]  been unrivaled for years, but surely there exists a neon

[2138.95s -> 2143.14s]  Okay.
[2143.14s -> 2144.44s]  Wait, I didn't do good enough.
[2145.44s -> 2146.44s]  Is that what it's telling me?
[2152.84s -> 2154.44s]  So I have to do I have to go way faster.
[2173.33s -> 2174.53s]  This is a speedrunning game.
[2177.14s -> 2178.64s]  You're going so slow.
[2178.74s -> 2183.31s]  Am I I was 27.
[2183.31s -> 2184.51s]  That's a gold medal.
[2184.61s -> 2185.21s]  He's got it.
[2188.61s -> 2189.41s]  93, right?
[2189.81s -> 2193.24s]  Doing fine.
[2195.00s -> 2195.70s]  I was just going around.
[2195.70s -> 2196.70s]  I what did I get on this one?
[2197.10s -> 2197.60s]  Okay bronze.
[2197.60s -> 2199.70s]  I need to do this in 13 seconds.
[2201.57s -> 2202.07s]  Great startup.
[2208.52s -> 2209.52s]  See if I can make that gap.
[2223.31s -> 2224.51s]  That's a that's a platinum.
[2224.51s -> 2225.71s]  See anyone beat that?
[2231.32s -> 2231.52s]  All right.
[2231.52s -> 2231.92s]  I get it.
[2233.42s -> 2236.33s]  Pretty sure I just got to 93.
[2243.88s -> 2245.78s]  This was silver, but I can do it in 19, right?
[2245.88s -> 2246.28s]  Let's do it.
[2258.61s -> 2258.81s]  I forgot.
[2258.81s -> 2259.91s]  I have to actually kill the stuff.
[2278.55s -> 2279.85s]  That was fucking messy.
[2280.55s -> 2298.66s]  I hold on there.
[2298.66s -> 2299.56s]  Another one down.
[2302.98s -> 2303.68s]  It's pretty cool.
[2303.68s -> 2303.98s]  It is.
[2303.98s -> 2304.58s]  Yeah, this is fun.
[2307.06s -> 2307.86s]  I'm enjoying it.
[2308.97s -> 2309.27s]  Okay.
[2309.47s -> 2323.13s]  Next mission time and days until judgment.
[2323.63s -> 2324.83s]  Let's go get new assignment.
[2326.70s -> 2328.30s]  Well, look at that.
[2328.50s -> 2332.60s]  Your neon rank is sufficient to move on to a new assignment.
[2332.80s -> 2334.10s]  Sounds are very really good.
[2334.20s -> 2336.10s]  Yeah, they're heavenly delight ticket.
[2336.30s -> 2342.76s]  How fun ticket granted to top-performing neon is good for one heavenly delight.
[2342.86s -> 2346.46s]  Is it the heavenly delight kiosk in the cathedral to redeem an experience beyond
[2346.46s -> 2347.26s]  your wildest dream?
[2347.26s -> 2349.06s]  One moment while I check on mr.
[2349.06s -> 2350.26s]  Mikey schedule.
[2351.46s -> 2358.43s]  Have a seat in about four hours for hours.
[2358.83s -> 2362.93s]  Why no, there's got to be somebody I can speak with soon.
[2362.93s -> 2364.23s]  I'll look into that for you.
[2364.23s -> 2366.63s]  And when will that be about four out?
[2366.63s -> 2367.33s]  All right.
[2367.83s -> 2368.73s]  This is ridiculous.
[2368.73s -> 2369.23s]  I'm going.
[2372.30s -> 2373.00s]  It is a cat.
[2376.34s -> 2376.84s]  Mikey.
[2381.84s -> 2386.34s]  Look, I expect this much from the barfield, but I'm not waiting four
[2386.34s -> 2390.54s]  hours for my stupid mission in heaven for hours.
[2394.94s -> 2396.44s]  I'll get to your ugly mug.
[2396.44s -> 2398.04s]  Once I finish up with the lady.
[2398.84s -> 2399.44s]  It's fine.
[2399.54s -> 2402.89s]  I don't mind if he stays red.
[2403.19s -> 2404.09s]  What are you doing in here?
[2404.59s -> 2405.79s]  Suit yourself, sweetheart.
[2406.19s -> 2406.59s]  Go ahead.
[2406.59s -> 2407.29s]  Wise guy.
[2407.49s -> 2408.39s]  Take a frequency.
[2408.39s -> 2413.09s]  Now listen up because I'm only going to say this once you got 10 days here.
[2413.39s -> 2417.29s]  The HCA will be rating your performance alongside the other competing
[2417.29s -> 2419.99s]  eons and whoever has the top score.
[2419.99s -> 2422.79s]  And if they can win, I'm going to be this for Halloween this year.
[2422.79s -> 2423.79s]  Don't steal my costume.
[2424.69s -> 2426.19s]  I'm showing up to the party like this.
[2426.29s -> 2426.99s]  You better not.
[2427.69s -> 2429.79s]  We both have the same neon white costume.
[2430.19s -> 2432.39s]  It's going to be it's going to be not cool.
[2434.36s -> 2435.36s]  I chose it first.
[2436.40s -> 2439.00s]  No, no, I set it out loud first.
[2443.76s -> 2444.96s]  I set it out loud first.
[2449.46s -> 2451.96s]  You jokers will be cleaning out lower heaven.
[2454.76s -> 2455.86s]  Sounds easy enough.
[2459.74s -> 2460.74s]  The Dracula.
[2466.86s -> 2468.76s]  Because the demons got him white.
[2469.06s -> 2470.66s]  I forgot about the Dracula costume.
[2470.66s -> 2471.16s]  That's right.
[2471.56s -> 2474.26s]  Yeah, I kind of got that.
[2476.86s -> 2479.16s]  Anyway, that just about covers it.
[2479.56s -> 2480.06s]  Any question?
[2480.06s -> 2480.46s]  Yeah.
[2481.36s -> 2482.46s]  Why are you a cat?
[2482.46s -> 2484.56s]  Okay, you're just saying whatever to me now.
[2484.56s -> 2486.66s]  I was actually wondering the same thing.
[2487.06s -> 2489.66s]  Why are you a hilarious cartoon cat?
[2489.66s -> 2490.66s]  Exactly.
[2490.66s -> 2492.56s]  You neons are all the same.
[2492.96s -> 2494.06s]  Oh, we're going to break that promise.
[2494.06s -> 2495.16s]  Moronic imagery.
[2495.16s -> 2499.06s]  Your pee brains embedded in an effort to comprehend as angels.
[2500.26s -> 2501.56s]  Oh, you're a cat.
[2501.56s -> 2502.46s]  You're a horse.
[2502.46s -> 2504.56s]  You're a sexy statue of Liberty.
[2504.76s -> 2506.46s]  How about a hey, Mikey?
[2506.46s -> 2507.66s]  How's your day, Mikey?
[2507.96s -> 2508.86s]  Excuse me.
[2508.86s -> 2510.16s]  I'm here for my appointment.
[2510.96s -> 2513.66s]  Hey, white, isn't it freaking crazy?
[2513.86s -> 2518.06s]  That John Cena is here in heaven giving us missions.
[2518.16s -> 2519.46s]  John Cena in this game?
[2520.26s -> 2521.36s]  Everybody out.
[2521.66s -> 2523.96s]  Don't come back till you finished your missions.
[2524.56s -> 2529.16s]  And Gabby, can you please keep these neons under control?
[2533.77s -> 2538.47s]  Hey, Red, before you go, I wanted to ask you if you knew what
[2538.47s -> 2540.17s]  the deal is with Green.
[2540.87s -> 2542.07s]  Stay away from him.
[2542.07s -> 2542.67s]  Uh-huh.
[2542.77s -> 2543.27s]  He's...
[2544.17s -> 2545.07s]  I could use some convincing.
[2545.07s -> 2546.67s]  I suppose I could open up more.
[2546.67s -> 2548.37s]  In exchange for a favor.
[2548.37s -> 2549.67s]  Wait, really?
[2549.67s -> 2550.87s]  Keep your pants on.
[2551.87s -> 2552.47s]  What's the favor?
[2552.47s -> 2553.07s]  What will that be?
[2553.47s -> 2555.37s]  Like, after this mission?
[2556.07s -> 2560.71s]  What's all this commotion about?
[2560.71s -> 2563.21s]  It's piña colada day at the pool.
[2563.21s -> 2563.91s]  So?
[2564.41s -> 2567.21s]  Heaven's piña coladas are to die for.
[2567.61s -> 2568.31s]  That's kind of good.
[2568.71s -> 2569.91s]  We'll see about that.
[2569.91s -> 2571.01s]  Oh, no, you won't.
[2571.21s -> 2572.91s]  I, really?
[2573.21s -> 2575.91s]  A sinner partaking in heaven's delight?
[2575.91s -> 2576.91s]  That's bull.
[2576.91s -> 2580.01s]  Stay back, neon, or I'll have you blown to bits.
[2580.21s -> 2580.91s]  Argh.
[2584.15s -> 2584.75s]  Are you...
[2585.35s -> 2586.15s]  Another cat.
[2587.15s -> 2588.85s]  You said you wanted a drink, right?
[2589.35s -> 2590.15s]  I know a place.
[2590.15s -> 2590.75s]  Follow me.
[2592.85s -> 2593.45s]  Why not?
[2597.22s -> 2598.22s]  Tada!
[2598.62s -> 2600.62s]  Welcome to the neon bar.
[2600.62s -> 2601.22s]  You like it?
[2601.52s -> 2603.62s]  Oh, it's not like the rest of heaven.
[2603.62s -> 2604.32s]  That's for sure.
[2604.32s -> 2605.02s]  I'm into it.
[2606.32s -> 2606.92s]  Thanks.
[2607.72s -> 2608.82s]  Can I actually order drinks?
[2608.82s -> 2609.82s]  Does it give me booze?
[2610.52s -> 2613.42s]  So, uh, who exactly are you?
[2614.32s -> 2615.42s]  You can call me Raz.
[2615.72s -> 2616.92s]  I'm the bartender here.
[2618.23s -> 2618.83s]  Raz.
[2621.15s -> 2623.25s]  I'm imagining you probably buy cards, booze.
[2623.25s -> 2623.85s]  White.
[2624.05s -> 2625.15s]  Well, white?
[2625.55s -> 2626.25s]  Good to meet you.
[2626.35s -> 2628.15s]  Believers don't come around these parts anymore.
[2628.15s -> 2631.75s]  So, it's the perfect place for neon to take a load off.
[2632.45s -> 2633.65s]  I like the sound of that.
[2633.65s -> 2634.45s]  What do you have?
[2634.45s -> 2635.95s]  How about one of those piña coladas?
[2635.95s -> 2636.45s]  On it.
[2639.52s -> 2640.52s]  Here you go.
[2640.52s -> 2641.12s]  What the?
[2641.52s -> 2643.12s]  This is literally just water.
[2644.02s -> 2644.62s]  Sorry.
[2645.22s -> 2647.62s]  The believers are hogging all the real stuff.
[2647.62s -> 2648.02s]  What?
[2648.02s -> 2651.02s]  How can you call this a bar if you don't serve any booze?
[2651.02s -> 2653.62s]  See, you're thinking too narrow.
[2653.62s -> 2657.32s]  A bar, give you one guy, you can fight it in another guy.
[2658.72s -> 2659.02s]  What?
[2659.02s -> 2660.12s]  Where's my piña colada?
[2660.62s -> 2661.42s]  I'm just saying.
[2661.82s -> 2664.12s]  A friend and folks in heaven has its benefits.
[2664.12s -> 2667.12s]  You'd be surprised by what you can gain from chatting people up.
[2667.62s -> 2669.52s]  And maybe giving them some gifts.
[2669.62s -> 2673.02s]  The believers wouldn't accept my piña colada patronage.
[2673.02s -> 2675.62s]  I doubt they'd let me into their crappy gift shop.
[2675.72s -> 2676.82s]  Well, no.
[2676.92s -> 2679.62s]  Once you've taken care of your missions, you can do a second
[2679.62s -> 2681.12s]  sweep to hunt for presents.
[2681.12s -> 2681.92s]  It's like a pain.
[2681.92s -> 2682.42s]  White.
[2683.72s -> 2685.92s]  And hey, if you give me a gift.
[2691.82s -> 2693.13s]  All right, let's go.
[2699.24s -> 2699.94s]  Lemon water.
[2699.94s -> 2700.44s]  Pause.
[2701.04s -> 2701.74s]  There you are.
[2702.14s -> 2703.14s]  Team up with me.
[2705.04s -> 2707.24s]  Jinx Vi, you owe me a coat.
[2708.48s -> 2710.78s]  Yellow, quit getting in my way.
[2710.78s -> 2711.98s]  So I have to choose a companion.
[2717.08s -> 2717.58s]  Join me.
[2717.58s -> 2720.90s]  And clearly the cutest choice here.
[2721.50s -> 2722.20s]  I don't know.
[2722.30s -> 2723.70s]  I'm pretty freaking cute.
[2723.70s -> 2727.40s]  Guys, guys, I'm flattered, but this is a competition.
[2727.50s -> 2729.00s]  I'm not here to make friends.
[2729.00s -> 2730.40s]  Yo, I totally get you.
[2730.50s -> 2732.60s]  That's why we should all team up.
[2733.10s -> 2734.10s]  No way.
[2734.40s -> 2735.80s]  Three's a crowd.
[2736.00s -> 2738.00s]  I'd rather eat my own pancreas.
[2738.20s -> 2739.20s]  Come on, Vi.
[2739.30s -> 2740.00s]  You sure?
[2740.80s -> 2742.70s]  And lone wolf here.
[2743.10s -> 2744.30s]  I'm not teaming up with.
[2744.30s -> 2748.40s]  You know, I met this other neon earlier who was a total simp.
[2748.70s -> 2751.20s]  Maybe I'll just go play with him instead.
[2752.30s -> 2753.80s]  Oh, what?
[2754.10s -> 2754.70s]  Who?
[2760.40s -> 2762.40s]  Looks like it's just you and me, bro.
[2765.53s -> 2765.73s]  All right.
[2765.73s -> 2768.23s]  So do I have a do I have a power or something with them?
[2768.63s -> 2769.63s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2769.63s -> 2770.53s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2770.53s -> 2771.13s]  I'm not ready.
[2781.74s -> 2782.74s]  Am I going too slow?
[2798.27s -> 2798.87s]  Fuck.
[2827.47s -> 2828.17s]  That was pretty.
[2828.37s -> 2829.17s]  That was pretty good.
[2829.17s -> 2830.37s]  That was gold.
[2830.97s -> 2833.48s]  I'll take gold.
[2837.91s -> 2840.51s]  I knew you would be bad at Splatoon story mode.
[2842.57s -> 2842.97s]  True.
[2849.31s -> 2850.51s]  Godspeed soul card.
[2850.51s -> 2855.14s]  The soul card fires like a semi-automatic rifle and you get a dash
[2855.34s -> 2857.54s]  dash horizontally in the direction you're aiming.
[2858.04s -> 2859.94s]  Stores demons and breakable objects.
[2860.54s -> 2861.54s]  How far is it?
[2861.54s -> 2861.84s]  Okay.
[2871.55s -> 2874.45s]  Oh, that was sad, but I can do it.
[2874.55s -> 2874.95s]  Okay.
[2874.95s -> 2875.65s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2876.45s -> 2877.15s]  We're doing that again.
[2878.05s -> 2878.55s]  Doing that again.
[2888.00s -> 2889.90s]  Oh, I can't just cheat.
[2893.25s -> 2893.95s]  Can I just cheat?
[2896.78s -> 2898.18s]  So it doesn't okay.
[2898.88s -> 2900.28s]  You can't get any vertical.
[2900.48s -> 2900.68s]  You can.
[2900.68s -> 2901.88s]  It's only horizontal only.
[2908.56s -> 2908.96s]  Wait a minute.
[2925.09s -> 2926.79s]  Can I break this without dashing?
[2933.04s -> 2957.22s]  Oh, well 13 another one down cold only use the first Godspeed
[2957.22s -> 2957.82s]  to get on the podium.
[2957.82s -> 2959.62s]  You just jump interesting.
[2970.32s -> 2972.02s]  Oh, that was a bonehead move.
[2981.86s -> 2982.56s]  I can take it.
[2982.66s -> 2983.26s]  I can do that better.
[2983.46s -> 2985.46s]  How much faster do I have to do 1817?
[2988.39s -> 2989.49s]  Now I can do 19.
[3000.96s -> 3001.56s]  How do I get that?
[3004.74s -> 3005.74s]  Wait, that's me.
[3026.30s -> 3026.80s]  There it is.
[3031.15s -> 3031.85s]  Yippee.
[3042.71s -> 3046.01s]  This is a perfect game for a fake manga fan like you.
[3048.04s -> 3048.44s]  I see it.
[3048.94s -> 3049.44s]  Oops.
[3049.91s -> 3057.32s]  Only one shot just that instantly.
[3079.19s -> 3079.69s]  Where do I go?
[3089.55s -> 3089.95s]  Shit.
[3089.95s -> 3091.65s]  Hey, let's keep it going.
[3094.73s -> 3095.63s]  22 seconds.
[3095.63s -> 3096.23s]  I can do it.
[3097.23s -> 3115.55s]  So if you dash through you get another one platinum.
[3116.12s -> 3117.22s]  That's how it's done.
[3118.86s -> 3119.66s]  Hey, I missed some of the stream.
[3119.66s -> 3121.76s]  Did he go to hell and was Ben Franklin there?
[3124.38s -> 3125.08s]  I'm not sure yet.
[3131.46s -> 3132.36s]  Hell, yeah, dude.
[3137.81s -> 3138.41s]  Oh, wait.
[3138.41s -> 3138.71s]  Okay.
[3138.71s -> 3139.71s]  This is a double here.
[3140.90s -> 3144.50s]  This is a grab this shoot and then this is a boom.
[3144.50s -> 3144.80s]  Boom.
[3150.52s -> 3151.72s]  I think somebody was alive up there.
[3153.87s -> 3155.17s]  I can't really tell but whatever.
[3156.62s -> 3157.42s]  Oh my God.
[3157.42s -> 3158.12s]  I blew it.
[3158.12s -> 3159.42s]  I thought that somebody was still alive.
[3160.32s -> 3162.22s]  Oh, it's just it's one of the other neons.
[3162.22s -> 3162.52s]  Okay.
[3162.52s -> 3163.32s]  I thought it was an enemy.
[3168.43s -> 3168.73s]  What?
[3179.16s -> 3180.66s]  No.
[3195.29s -> 3200.00s]  Oh, only silver.
[3200.00s -> 3200.70s]  What am I missing here?
[3206.16s -> 3206.86s]  12 seconds.
[3206.86s -> 3207.76s]  What am I missing here?
[3221.60s -> 3223.29s]  Ah, all right.
[3223.29s -> 3223.89s]  Settle down.
[3249.90s -> 3252.00s]  The dash somebody said the dash does go vertical.
[3252.00s -> 3253.10s]  I can't get it to go vertical.
[3260.76s -> 3262.06s]  Does the dash work?
[3262.16s -> 3262.26s]  Okay.
[3262.26s -> 3264.56s]  When you hit an enemy with the dash, does it actually just refill it?
[3266.24s -> 3267.54s]  Doesn't only on those big ones.
[3282.76s -> 3284.86s]  I mean, how do I get up there that fast?
[3302.15s -> 3302.75s]  Damn it.
[3302.75s -> 3303.85s]  I lost time on that.
[3305.14s -> 3306.04s]  Skip dropping down.
[3306.04s -> 3306.64s]  Just dash.
[3322.33s -> 3322.83s]  Shit.
[3336.95s -> 3349.82s]  Wait, now I have to break that.
[3349.82s -> 3351.32s]  I have to kill the enemy down there.
[3351.72s -> 3352.62s]  Skip the second door.
[3352.62s -> 3354.12s]  I still have to kill the thing down there though, right?
[3365.50s -> 3366.90s]  Shoot it and then dash to the exit.
[3372.70s -> 3373.20s]  God damn it.
[3384.21s -> 3385.01s]  My brain can't do it.
[3388.37s -> 3390.27s]  I mean it can but it's just too many things in a row.
[3395.54s -> 3395.74s]  All right.
[3395.74s -> 3402.25s]  So, but how how do I skip?
[3402.45s -> 3407.05s]  How do I kill that but skip the door without getting the jump?
[3408.53s -> 3409.03s]  I get it.
[3411.86s -> 3413.66s]  Just go from here to there.
[3416.74s -> 3417.84s]  Let me take, let me go slow.
[3426.20s -> 3426.60s]  Okay.
[3427.88s -> 3428.98s]  I just go like this.
[3431.39s -> 3431.49s]  All right.
[3431.49s -> 3431.99s]  That's how you do it.
[3432.09s -> 3432.39s]  I got it.
[3446.32s -> 3446.52s]  Yes.
[3446.52s -> 3447.82s]  Let's see anyone beat that.
[3453.43s -> 3456.13s]  I wonder if you can even do it normally.
[3457.07s -> 3457.57s]  This is a fun game.
[3457.57s -> 3457.97s]  I like this.
[3461.76s -> 3462.96s]  Come on already.
[3462.96s -> 3464.26s]  Quit it with the jokes.
[3467.41s -> 3468.51s]  I can't help it.
[3468.51s -> 3469.01s]  Yeah.
[3469.21s -> 3469.71s]  Yeah.
[3469.91s -> 3471.31s]  You and your sunshine.
[3472.54s -> 3473.64s]  Did you do something quirky?
[3476.54s -> 3476.94s]  Hey.
[3477.74s -> 3478.24s]  No.
[3478.54s -> 3479.04s]  Sorry.
[3479.14s -> 3479.64s]  I don't.
[3480.14s -> 3481.64s]  Sounds like it was chill though.
[3481.74s -> 3482.14s]  Oh great.
[3482.14s -> 3483.04s]  He said he liked the game.
[3483.04s -> 3485.14s]  Prepare to never see it after this stream.
[3486.24s -> 3496.02s]  Man, I'd give my left nut to go back and do it all over again.
[3496.32s -> 3498.22s]  Even all the weird stuff at the end.
[3499.26s -> 3501.66s]  I don't blame you for any of it, you know.
[3506.24s -> 3507.74s]  What the hell is that supposed to mean?
[3507.74s -> 3508.74s]  Dude, chill.
[3508.74s -> 3510.64s]  The vibes are immaculate.
[3510.84s -> 3511.34s]  What?
[3511.34s -> 3512.84s]  I just want to kick ass with my bro.
[3512.94s -> 3513.84s]  Did you just say that?
[3514.14s -> 3516.04s]  You just said the vibes are immaculate?
[3519.22s -> 3519.72s]  Really?
[3520.36s -> 3520.96s]  Wow.
[3521.46s -> 3522.06s]  Okay.
[3526.63s -> 3527.93s]  I like this guy way more now.
[3528.50s -> 3529.00s]  Yeah.
[3532.78s -> 3533.68s]  My god, dude.
[3533.88s -> 3536.58s]  Remember when you messed up the toilet after you ate that chili?
[3536.88s -> 3538.98s]  That was insane.
[3539.78s -> 3541.18s]  Yo, hold up.
[3541.78s -> 3542.28s]  Wait, what?
[3542.28s -> 3545.18s]  That's not, why would you, that's a weird thing to bring up to somebody.
[3545.18s -> 3545.78s]  That's weird.
[3545.78s -> 3547.08s]  That's fucking strange.
[3553.60s -> 3554.70s]  I don't know what that's distracting me.
[3554.70s -> 3555.40s]  I don't know what that's for.
[3561.27s -> 3563.47s]  That was very distracting, but I think I still got the gold medal.
[3563.47s -> 3564.67s]  Didn't even break a sweat.
[3571.56s -> 3574.46s]  Every cutscene loses like 400 viewers.
[3580.26s -> 3581.36s]  That's pretty funny.
[3581.76s -> 3582.96s]  That's actually funny.
[3590.46s -> 3591.36s]  Shit, I fell.
[3594.28s -> 3595.08s]  Shit, I fell again.
[3596.31s -> 3599.21s]  Every cutscene loses 500 viewers.
[3612.66s -> 3613.36s]  A long way.
[3616.51s -> 3617.61s]  How did I lose time?
[3631.76s -> 3632.66s]  Oh, it's...
[3634.82s -> 3636.82s]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[3652.73s -> 3653.33s]  Stop jumping.
[3653.33s -> 3654.63s]  I, doesn't do anything.
[3668.63s -> 3668.93s]  Damn it.
[3668.93s -> 3669.33s]  Yeah.
[3672.26s -> 3674.16s]  I feel like I was pretty close to the platinum one.
[3674.46s -> 3674.86s]  Let me see.
[3681.09s -> 3682.59s]  Probably one or two seconds.
[3684.03s -> 3684.73s]  I can definitely get it.
[3684.73s -> 3685.33s]  Let's get it.
[3700.10s -> 3702.10s]  Oh, sad.
[3738.21s -> 3745.21s]  Bounce to platinum.
[3746.13s -> 3747.33s]  It's because I'm the best.
[3748.49s -> 3750.49s]  I think your Vtuber avatar isn't rigged right.
[3750.49s -> 3751.49s]  The space isn't moving.
[3766.26s -> 3767.56s]  I feel like I just lost time there.
[3768.88s -> 3769.68s]  Let's do that again.
[3779.41s -> 3781.11s]  That's definitely the best way to go.
[3783.16s -> 3784.76s]  Get a land right on the lip.
[3784.76s -> 3785.86s]  I did it too, shit.
[3791.32s -> 3792.12s]  That's definitely it.
[3809.88s -> 3810.98s]  That might have been more accurate.
[3833.43s -> 3834.73s]  Didn't even break a sweat.
[3834.73s -> 3835.33s]  Unfortunate.
[3846.32s -> 3848.02s]  You just have to hop over the side.
[3849.59s -> 3850.59s]  26?
[3850.59s -> 3852.19s]  Oh, yeah, I can have that.
[3852.19s -> 3853.99s]  That extra second was just the beginning.
[3869.61s -> 3871.41s]  I know I'm supposed to get the presence, but whatever.
[3877.98s -> 3878.38s]  There it is.
[3879.05s -> 3880.05s]  That's how it's done.
[3885.73s -> 3887.33s]  To do a Ben and Jerry's tier list.
[3887.93s -> 3889.13s]  Half-baked S.
[3889.53s -> 3891.13s]  Everything else A.
[3892.03s -> 3893.13s]  Everything else A.
[3895.06s -> 3896.66s]  I don't even need to show it on screen.
[3915.87s -> 3919.27s]  Oh, a little too, a little too far there.
[3923.00s -> 3923.80s]  I'm gonna hold this.
[3926.69s -> 3927.09s]  Damn it.
[3937.20s -> 3938.50s]  I'm holding it for way too long.
[3954.44s -> 3955.34s]  I can definitely do it.
[3968.15s -> 3968.65s]  A hundred percent.
[3968.65s -> 3969.05s]  Ready?
[3972.90s -> 3973.80s]  Oh, fuck you.
[3973.80s -> 3974.70s]  I can definitely do it.
[3974.90s -> 3976.60s]  That's gonna shave like three seconds off too.
[3988.03s -> 3988.93s]  Oh, come on.
[3993.26s -> 3994.06s]  I know I can do it.
[4004.30s -> 4005.10s]  It's dope.
[4005.20s -> 4006.30s]  Yeah, it's right there.
[4006.30s -> 4006.80s]  But whatever.
[4007.30s -> 4008.20s]  Let's try it the regular way.
[4024.36s -> 4026.66s]  Guess I could shoot and skip this whole thing.
[4031.77s -> 4032.97s]  I'm gonna skip that whole section.
[4045.43s -> 4046.13s]  I freaked out.
[4046.23s -> 4047.13s]  I need to, where do I go?
[4048.62s -> 4049.02s]  Hold on.
[4051.10s -> 4051.70s]  Where is it?
[4052.00s -> 4052.30s]  Hold on.
[4052.30s -> 4052.90s]  I'm freaking out.
[4059.08s -> 4059.98s]  I need to see it again.
[4060.68s -> 4063.42s]  Because it's bounce off.
[4063.62s -> 4064.42s]  Okay, it's over here.
[4066.26s -> 4067.66s]  Can I just skip this whole section?
[4069.34s -> 4070.74s]  I shoot those two in the beginning.
[4071.44s -> 4072.74s]  Need to end up up there.
[4076.18s -> 4076.58s]  Okay.
[4079.02s -> 4079.52s]  See it up.
[4092.39s -> 4093.69s]  I don't, maybe I can't.
[4125.55s -> 4126.85s]  That's still gold somehow.
[4126.85s -> 4127.25s]  What is it?
[4127.25s -> 4127.85s]  What is platinum?
[4134.35s -> 4134.65s]  All right.
[4134.65s -> 4137.42s]  That's pretty fair amount that I still need to do.
[4138.22s -> 4139.02s]  Let me try that again.
[4143.81s -> 4144.51s]  Oh, it's gone.
[4144.51s -> 4144.91s]  Oops.
[4162.54s -> 4163.54s]  Oh, there it is.
[4167.48s -> 4168.48s]  No.
[4168.98s -> 4169.58s]  I know where to go.
[4185.60s -> 4186.70s]  You stupid idiot.
[4224.43s -> 4224.93s]  Platinum.
[4225.03s -> 4226.23s]  It's because I'm the best.
[4233.00s -> 4233.20s]  All right.
[4233.20s -> 4234.20s]  This is the last level here.
[4234.80s -> 4237.30s]  In this particular zone.
[4252.13s -> 4254.53s]  I mean, we're kind of just going here.
[4254.83s -> 4268.20s]  Oh, it was kind of ugly.
[4268.20s -> 4268.80s]  But sorry.
[4272.52s -> 4273.52s]  I wonder where the skips are here.
[4275.47s -> 4278.27s]  I think I could just do just go faster and I should get it.
[4290.52s -> 4291.02s]  I blew it.
[4317.56s -> 4317.86s]  All right.
[4317.86s -> 4319.46s]  Even break a sweat 22.
[4319.56s -> 4320.46s]  I'm making a lot of noises.
[4320.46s -> 4320.76s]  Sorry.
[4324.46s -> 4325.16s]  I can go faster.
[4325.16s -> 4326.16s]  I just got to get the whole thing down.
[4326.16s -> 4326.56s]  I'll get it.
[4327.60s -> 4328.70s]  Just skip that whole top part.
[4330.32s -> 4331.02s]  Let me look at it.
[4339.02s -> 4339.62s]  Look at that.
[4360.89s -> 4362.69s]  I'm so I'm getting so I'm getting ahead of myself.
[4368.07s -> 4368.97s]  Oh, fuck you.
[4394.42s -> 4425.53s]  Oh, 23.9 shit in my pants.
[4425.53s -> 4426.63s]  23.3.
[4469.60s -> 4470.40s]  Fuck you.
[4471.30s -> 4471.70s]  Shit.
[4480.36s -> 4480.86s]  How?
[4496.51s -> 4497.51s]  Oh, you idiot.
[4497.51s -> 4498.31s]  I hate you.
[4501.15s -> 4501.85s]  It's falling apart.
[4502.15s -> 4502.65s]  It's falling apart.
[4502.65s -> 4502.95s]  It's false.
[4502.95s -> 4503.55s]  I gotta get back.
[4503.55s -> 4503.95s]  Come on.
[4519.06s -> 4520.26s]  What are you talking about game?
[4520.26s -> 4521.06s]  What are you happening?
[4521.66s -> 4522.06s]  What?
[4522.26s -> 4522.96s]  I didn't go through.
[4522.96s -> 4523.36s]  Why?
[4545.52s -> 4546.02s]  How is that?
[4557.95s -> 4558.65s]  It's falling apart.
[4564.45s -> 4565.55s]  Is that even faster?
[4566.35s -> 4568.35s]  It might that might be adding time by the way.
[4572.52s -> 4573.32s]  That's adding time.
[4595.26s -> 4596.76s]  Oh, you piece of shit.
[4620.59s -> 4620.89s]  20.
[4621.09s -> 4622.29s]  Oh my God.
[4633.62s -> 4634.72s]  I don't like this guy in front of me.
[4634.92s -> 4635.52s]  I don't like it.
[4635.52s -> 4637.42s]  He's he's doing way better than me every time.
[4637.42s -> 4638.02s]  It's annoying.
[4646.60s -> 4647.10s]  Wait a minute.
[4647.10s -> 4647.60s]  Hold on.
[4647.60s -> 4648.50s]  Hold on a second.
[4649.70s -> 4650.70s]  I may have just solved it.
[4663.49s -> 4664.59s]  Oh, yeah.
[4667.57s -> 4668.47s]  I don't think I can get high enough.
[4684.77s -> 4685.97s]  Somebody said shoot the glass.
[4686.07s -> 4686.77s]  I don't think that works.
[4706.00s -> 4707.20s]  I don't think I can get that high.
[4711.15s -> 4712.65s]  Just look at the hand icon.
[4715.52s -> 4716.02s]  Where is it?
[4716.62s -> 4717.62s]  Oh, I see it over there.
[4722.63s -> 4723.73s]  What does it want me to do though?
[4723.73s -> 4724.13s]  Hold on.
[4724.63s -> 4725.73s]  I'm going to jump this way.
[4730.22s -> 4730.72s]  I get it.
[4748.48s -> 4749.38s]  I mean, this is slop.
[4749.38s -> 4750.58s]  This is fucking sloppy.
[4751.66s -> 4753.16s]  So how many more demons are there?
[4754.87s -> 4755.87s]  Or where are they?
[4756.91s -> 4757.21s]  One, two, three.
[4757.21s -> 4757.91s]  Okay, I get it.
[4768.49s -> 4769.19s]  Oh, come on.
[4773.33s -> 4774.33s]  Didn't mean to click twice.
[4775.13s -> 4777.13s]  When you do the same level like a hundred times, sometimes your
[4777.13s -> 4778.23s]  brain just is like, you know what?
[4778.23s -> 4779.63s]  Just do it terribly this time.
[4780.50s -> 4782.10s]  And do it terribly ten times in a row.
[4797.66s -> 4798.46s]  Still might be all right.
[4804.42s -> 4804.92s]  Yeah, I got it.
[4808.80s -> 4809.40s]  I got the platinum.
[4809.40s -> 4810.10s]  I got the platinum.
[4810.10s -> 4810.70s]  I got the platinum.
[4814.45s -> 4816.15s]  That's a platinum on every level, isn't it?
[4821.78s -> 4822.38s]  I like it.
[4830.20s -> 4833.20s]  I gotta admit that was pretty hard.
[4833.20s -> 4835.10s]  Do we lose four to 500 viewers?
[4835.10s -> 4835.60s]  Let's see.
[4844.38s -> 4845.98s]  It's kind of the end of the show and
[4846.68s -> 4850.38s]  every people are just standing up and walking.
[4850.38s -> 4854.08s]  The show is not done, but people are just getting up out of their
[4854.08s -> 4855.68s]  seats and walking out.
[4857.24s -> 4861.14s]  What we're in the bottom of the ninth inning and my team is up
[4861.14s -> 4863.04s]  by a hundred and fifty runs.
[4863.94s -> 4868.84s]  So that's about a dozen for me and the kids tonight.
[4869.44s -> 4870.24s]  We're going to go home.
[4871.54s -> 4874.67s]  Wait, I'm not starting to like this guy.
[4874.67s -> 4875.07s]  Am I?
[4877.22s -> 4878.52s]  This is part of his plan.
[4879.12s -> 4881.12s]  Waiting for me to let my hey, it's all good.
[4881.12s -> 4882.72s]  It doesn't matter for 10,000 people.
[4882.72s -> 4886.22s]  You know, here's your it could be a thousand of you hanging
[4886.22s -> 4887.22s]  out here and I still do it.
[4897.25s -> 4897.95s]  What about 10?
[4897.95s -> 4902.37s]  Nah, actually at least 12.
[4903.07s -> 4906.82s]  Yo, I didn't think I'd actually get to save your life this
[4906.82s -> 4907.42s]  fast.
[4910.79s -> 4912.69s]  You really got to be more careful, bro.
[4912.99s -> 4914.89s]  Here, take my hand.
[4919.27s -> 4923.97s]  I was like the concept of a second channel, but I had
[4924.67s -> 4928.57s]  Nah, if I'm going to be just kind of chilling out here and
[4928.57s -> 4931.47s]  whatever if you're either here or you're not you didn't save
[4931.47s -> 4933.67s]  Jack dumbass a second channel is an act.
[4933.67s -> 4936.47s]  I don't know what I feel like I would just do the same thing
[4936.47s -> 4940.26s]  I'm doing right now in act.
[4942.25s -> 4945.95s]  Yeah to see how easily I could have sliced you a master of
[4945.95s -> 4946.45s]  comedy.
[4947.05s -> 4952.35s]  You freaking crack me up, dude.
[4953.77s -> 4954.97s]  Yeah, I'm just gonna do whatever.
[4955.90s -> 4958.90s]  We're just gonna do whatever what if there's one thing that
[4958.90s -> 4963.00s]  means 5,000 people leave hard, but you really got whatever
[4963.00s -> 4966.14s]  who cares wouldn't be best bros.
[4966.14s -> 4971.98s]  If I did who gives a crap my back and like vice-visa next
[4971.98s -> 4974.08s]  time I'll save you for real.
[4975.18s -> 4978.18s]  Tell even worse jokes on a second channel.
[4985.49s -> 4990.76s]  Dead guy, huh?
[4990.86s -> 4992.26s]  Oh shit viewers increasing.
[4992.86s -> 4994.66s]  No, no, that's we don't want that.
[4995.37s -> 4997.97s]  We want to we want to drop below 10k.
[4997.97s -> 4999.47s]  We don't want to have there be more people.
[4999.47s -> 5004.99s]  Welcome back Neons you survived your first mission but
[5004.99s -> 5008.09s]  surviving is not the same as winning.
[5011.46s -> 5015.06s]  Please direct your attention to greens mechanical halo a
[5015.06s -> 5019.76s]  mechanism that grants Neons the ability to stay in heaven.
[5021.39s -> 5022.19s]  Get them out of here.
[5022.29s -> 5023.99s]  We're looking for negative growth.
[5026.56s -> 5028.16s]  I say I want to hit negative growth.
[5028.16s -> 5030.46s]  I want people to I want less people to be here.
[5031.60s -> 5032.70s]  Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
[5032.70s -> 5035.20s]  I want I want that the least amount of people to be here
[5035.70s -> 5040.61s]  that could be what negative growth not a single neon has
[5040.61s -> 5043.01s]  come close to overtaking green score.
[5044.01s -> 5047.21s]  He's defended his position at the top for many years now
[5047.21s -> 5051.01s]  and I I don't imagine he intends to give it up now.
[5053.34s -> 5056.24s]  Not when he's made such a comfortable home for himself here
[5056.24s -> 5061.82s]  in paradise, isn't that the stomach are you saying that even
[5061.82s -> 5064.92s]  if we win we don't get to stay in heaven forever.
[5064.92s -> 5066.32s]  Oh goodness.
[5066.32s -> 5074.88s]  No God's mercy has its limits and an expiration date seriously.
[5075.28s -> 5076.38s]  That's such a rebel.
[5079.09s -> 5082.99s]  If you'd prefer the flames of hell for eternity to a year
[5082.99s -> 5093.68s]  of heavenly delights and be my guest dark and darker do better.
[5096.40s -> 5099.00s]  I have seen a lot of people playing it on stream.
[5101.25s -> 5104.25s]  I know they added a couple of classes right staring at me
[5104.25s -> 5104.75s]  again.
[5113.73s -> 5115.63s]  I'm not trying to skip dialogue.
[5116.33s -> 5118.83s]  I'm just trying to get us to a position where I can do the
[5118.83s -> 5123.72s]  next chapter in the time that I would like to continue to
[5123.72s -> 5128.82s]  stream so it's not about skipping the dialogue but getting
[5128.82s -> 5132.30s]  to the action so I can do the chapter so I can continue to
[5132.30s -> 5140.80s]  play it in the time that I would like to be streaming you
[5140.80s -> 5142.00s]  are bad tone acts.
[5142.00s -> 5142.50s]  Let's see.
[5142.50s -> 5144.00s]  Well, look at that.
[5144.00s -> 5146.80s]  You've earned yourself a heavenly delight.
[5146.80s -> 5152.46s]  One moment while I check in go ahead and take a it's all the
[5152.46s -> 5153.66s]  people I get the cool.
[5153.86s -> 5160.47s]  I'm not I'm not skipping this but I'm just okay.
[5167.70s -> 5170.30s]  Okay, I want to do the section and that's probably going to
[5170.30s -> 5171.30s]  be the end of the stream.
[5171.70s -> 5172.60s]  But I do want to do this.
[5173.10s -> 5175.70s]  What I'm so glad I ran into you.
[5175.70s -> 5176.90s]  Mikey must have thought I was.
[5176.90s -> 5178.00s]  Yeah, what the heck.
[5178.60s -> 5179.00s]  You mean?
[5179.00s -> 5181.00s]  Yeah, what is it with you?
[5181.00s -> 5181.60s]  Sorry.
[5183.40s -> 5185.90s]  You really don't remember anything.
[5186.10s -> 5190.10s]  This is important dialogue back when we were alive yellow
[5190.10s -> 5191.80s]  did some messed up stuff.
[5191.80s -> 5194.20s]  He got tangled up with some shady character.
[5194.20s -> 5196.20s]  It was you who's are we talking about the same?
[5196.20s -> 5197.80s]  Yeah, that's silly.
[5203.32s -> 5203.82s]  Let's go.
[5210.71s -> 5211.51s]  Okay, I got it.
[5214.28s -> 5214.48s]  Come on.
[5214.48s -> 5217.48s]  Wait, come on.
[5217.48s -> 5240.28s]  Wait, I cannot kill that is just line of sight.
[5246.20s -> 5255.49s]  Wait a minute.
[5255.59s -> 5256.49s]  That's pretty stupid.
[5265.40s -> 5266.10s]  Uh-huh.
[5266.10s -> 5266.50s]  Okay.
[5276.72s -> 5277.02s]  Fuck.
[5277.02s -> 5277.62s]  I don't get it.
[5279.96s -> 5284.53s]  I mean I do but I don't because you have to kill everything.
[5284.73s -> 5290.04s]  So how would does that count as a demon do I actually have
[5290.04s -> 5310.91s]  to kill this thing is it hold on it does count not make that
[5310.91s -> 5315.62s]  I guess I that was very slow.
[5316.79s -> 5317.79s]  I'm even going right way.
[5321.01s -> 5322.51s]  Wait, what the hell is down here?
[5326.78s -> 5327.88s]  Okay, hold on.
[5360.55s -> 5363.05s]  I feel like this is done very poorly but whatever.
[5369.43s -> 5369.83s]  No.
[5369.83s -> 5371.43s]  Yeah, not bad.
[5372.13s -> 5374.73s]  Could be but could be better but okay.
[5380.88s -> 5382.18s]  It's a lot of time to shave off.
[5382.89s -> 5383.69s]  I might come back to it.
[5387.39s -> 5388.59s]  Yeah, gold's gold's good.
[5388.69s -> 5390.59s]  Don't get platinum on every single one.
[5392.07s -> 5394.67s]  The machine gun stomp on the ground to create a large blast
[5394.67s -> 5397.07s]  that destroys most demons and breakable objects.
[5398.20s -> 5399.20s]  Very clear.
[5424.22s -> 5425.12s]  I think that's everybody.
[5430.75s -> 5431.15s]  Yuck.
[5433.24s -> 5434.84s]  Yeah, that that was yuck.
[5436.13s -> 5448.80s]  I wonder if I can think I'm going to skip that whole part.
[5460.39s -> 5464.60s]  Wait, let's get that part too.
[5489.54s -> 5490.84s]  Oh, I missed.
[5498.32s -> 5498.82s]  I'll get it.
[5516.61s -> 5517.21s]  Bottom, right?
[5517.41s -> 5519.48s]  Yeah, did you see that?
[5523.75s -> 5525.85s]  Hey viewer, did you pet your pet today?
[5526.05s -> 5526.95s]  Go show them some love.
[5526.95s -> 5527.45s]  I agree.
[5562.23s -> 5563.03s]  I don't know where to go.
[5567.49s -> 5567.89s]  Yuck.
[5573.14s -> 5575.54s]  I can get a couple seconds shaved off of that.
[5587.01s -> 5588.31s]  I think that's actually the play.
[5588.71s -> 5589.21s]  No, it's not.
[5589.21s -> 5589.61s]  Not at all.
[5618.90s -> 5619.50s]  Funny.
[5619.50s -> 5628.17s]  Yeah, I still can't believe the Winnie the Pooh question
[5628.17s -> 5629.77s]  that I'm going to think about that for like a week.
[5640.05s -> 5648.70s]  Maybe maybe no, I can't.
[5653.54s -> 5655.54s]  That's I got to make that a lot cleaner.
[5666.82s -> 5667.52s]  Okay, cool.
[5699.62s -> 5700.82s]  Oh, what a mistake.
[5717.88s -> 5745.14s]  What broke it the old and break a sweat.
[5745.14s -> 5745.94s]  I could probably get platinum.
[5752.86s -> 5755.86s]  What does it probably 19 18?
[5760.26s -> 5762.26s]  I could do 20 that I should be able to get 20.
[5776.67s -> 5777.27s]  Excuse me.
[5777.27s -> 5779.07s]  What was there was a hint right there.
[5779.77s -> 5780.27s]  Hold on.
[5787.82s -> 5788.72s]  What's the goal here?
[5794.29s -> 5795.99s]  Oh, does that help?
[5816.02s -> 5816.62s]  Well, okay.
[5816.62s -> 5818.42s]  Anyone beat that floppy, but I got it.
[5830.74s -> 5832.24s]  Gonna dash through the door for more time.
[5833.34s -> 5834.24s]  That's true.
[5839.49s -> 5840.39s]  I got caught right there.
[5849.40s -> 5851.40s]  Oh, saving time.
[5854.09s -> 5854.79s]  Yeah.
[5864.26s -> 5865.86s]  How old do you think we are German?
[5865.86s -> 5866.56s]  I think it I don't know.
[5869.03s -> 5869.93s]  This is a pretty big range.
[5884.08s -> 5884.88s]  I got stuck.
[5884.98s -> 5885.28s]  Oops.
[5885.28s -> 5886.18s]  Oh, it's over.
[5887.44s -> 5887.84s]  Maybe not.
[5891.54s -> 5892.14s]  Hey, sorry.
[5894.39s -> 5895.49s]  What's your target demographic?
[5895.49s -> 5896.69s]  This is a mature audience stream.
[5897.65s -> 5901.38s]  Yeah, I'm really working up a sweat is the stream is for adults.
[5903.30s -> 5903.90s]  Nevermind.
[5904.50s -> 5905.20s]  You're not an adult.
[5905.70s -> 5906.40s]  Get out of here.
[5906.50s -> 5907.40s]  Neon orange.
[5908.30s -> 5909.40s]  That's a fuck out of here.
[5909.40s -> 5911.10s]  If you're not an adult, the secret.
[5912.00s -> 5913.10s]  Damn, that sucks.
[5914.10s -> 5916.00s]  Tell me more about these secrets though.
[5918.83s -> 5919.83s]  Are you gonna skip the story?
[5920.73s -> 5921.83s]  Yeah.
[5923.73s -> 5924.83s]  Damn, dude.
[5926.83s -> 5928.53s]  I love it in all caps in the middle of this.
[5929.03s -> 5930.43s]  Everybody leave it.
[5930.43s -> 5931.63s]  It's a cutscene.
[5934.53s -> 5935.33s]  And look what happened.
[5937.62s -> 5938.62s]  Actually, I think I'm all right with that.
[5938.62s -> 5940.02s]  I think I got the whole gist of what just happened.
[5941.02s -> 5941.72s]  I'm okay with that.
[5941.72s -> 5943.22s]  I think I understand everything.
[5943.32s -> 5944.62s]  I've comprehended everything that happened.
[5972.98s -> 5973.48s]  Silver.
[5977.92s -> 5980.22s]  That was a gold if I ever seen it.
[5980.82s -> 5981.12s]  Yeah.
[5998.35s -> 5999.35s]  Why am I getting this?
[6000.77s -> 6001.87s]  That's completely unnecessary.
[6002.27s -> 6006.80s]  Another one down.
[6006.80s -> 6007.70s]  Just skip that whole section.
[6007.70s -> 6011.37s]  I don't know why I'm getting the falling down so gently.
[6025.47s -> 6028.47s]  There's a way to go down there, but I'm going to keep my tactic.
[6032.32s -> 6036.12s]  My tactic didn't even wait one.
[6038.18s -> 6061.53s]  Oh, that's sad 1647.
[6061.53s -> 6062.93s]  Yeah, I didn't even need to use the thing.
[6062.93s -> 6064.83s]  See that don't even need the hand.
[6064.83s -> 6067.20s]  I got the ace medal without it.
[6072.20s -> 6074.70s]  What I got in 13 seconds 14 seconds, but it's all good.
[6085.98s -> 6086.38s]  Okay.
[6089.76s -> 6090.06s]  All right.
[6095.89s -> 6108.48s]  Oh, okay.
[6108.48s -> 6109.28s]  Well, we'll try that again.
[6123.25s -> 6124.75s]  That's a mess up right there.
[6139.07s -> 6141.17s]  I'm doing something really fucking wrong here.
[6168.55s -> 6170.45s]  Better, but I keep losing momentum over there.
[6183.61s -> 6184.91s]  I bet I can skip that part.
[6192.18s -> 6194.18s]  Whoa, I went way too high.
[6194.98s -> 6204.96s]  Oh, it was long.
[6221.70s -> 6224.30s]  What part of your body did you wash last my hands?
[6226.20s -> 6226.70s]  Pretty good.
[6227.00s -> 6228.10s]  Gotcha question though.
[6233.84s -> 6235.14s]  Give her to shoot this guy too.
[6245.65s -> 6246.25s]  Oh fuck.
[6248.79s -> 6253.32s]  No, I win.
[6254.81s -> 6261.78s]  Yeah, I didn't know this where it was.
[6268.38s -> 6273.97s]  Oh, I think that's doable without any shortcuts.
[6275.87s -> 6276.57s]  That was terrible.
[6276.57s -> 6277.27s]  Let me try that again.
[6280.74s -> 6296.56s]  Oh, come on.
[6296.66s -> 6297.46s]  Let me try this too.
[6299.67s -> 6299.97s]  Ready?
[6306.23s -> 6306.53s]  Okay.
[6307.33s -> 6307.93s]  That's all right.
[6321.86s -> 6323.66s]  Why did I fall?
[6333.88s -> 6335.38s]  I shaved off a full second right there.
[6342.21s -> 6354.17s]  Oh, oh fuck off.
[6354.37s -> 6355.47s]  I don't I hate what this place.
[6356.17s -> 6356.87s]  Bad placement.
[6365.84s -> 6366.84s]  What is going on here?
[6367.34s -> 6369.24s]  How come I keep just jumping over that?
[6370.14s -> 6370.74s]  I have an idea.
[6376.17s -> 6377.37s]  That idea was really dumb.
[6384.07s -> 6384.97s]  Don't be impatient.
[6385.37s -> 6386.47s]  That's my entire life.
[6388.47s -> 6391.07s]  My whole life has been being impatient.
[6391.47s -> 6394.47s]  My entire existence is built off of being impatient.
[6396.00s -> 6400.70s]  Everything you've ever seen, you've ever heard is because of my impatience.
[6406.25s -> 6407.35s]  Oh, I fucked it up.
[6417.32s -> 6419.22s]  No, I used it.
[6419.22s -> 6419.92s]  It was stupid.
[6423.90s -> 6424.20s]  Where is it?
[6424.20s -> 6424.60s]  Where is it?
[6426.50s -> 6427.00s]  I know what to do.
[6427.00s -> 6427.40s]  I got it.
[6427.40s -> 6427.80s]  I got it.
[6427.80s -> 6428.10s]  I got it.
[6428.10s -> 6428.20s]  I got it.
[6428.20s -> 6428.70s]  Just wait, wait, wait.
[6440.94s -> 6442.04s]  Just shoot everything over there.
[6449.72s -> 6450.72s]  I have to keep one of these.
[6457.19s -> 6457.59s]  You idiot.
[6458.19s -> 6459.59s]  I even knew what I had to do too.
[6460.63s -> 6461.43s]  I still did it wrong.
[6462.63s -> 6463.63s]  My brain was like, do it like this.
[6463.63s -> 6464.03s]  Do it like this.
[6464.03s -> 6464.53s]  Do it like this.
[6464.53s -> 6465.93s]  Oh, don't do it like that.
[6467.12s -> 6467.62s]  Excuse me.
[6474.00s -> 6475.80s]  Oh, why?
[6475.90s -> 6476.60s]  Why?
[6477.00s -> 6477.70s]  Oh my God.
[6477.70s -> 6479.70s]  I just I started overthinking everything.
[6483.79s -> 6484.89s]  I didn't even want that thing equipped.
[6484.89s -> 6485.79s]  I wanted the rifle.
[6492.61s -> 6493.91s]  I wanted the rifle equipped.
[6494.51s -> 6495.01s]  This thing.
[6498.73s -> 6499.03s]  Okay.
[6499.03s -> 6499.63s]  Do it right.
[6507.70s -> 6508.60s]  I don't even know if it helps.
[6516.76s -> 6518.16s]  Oh my God.
[6518.16s -> 6518.76s]  Damn it.
[6518.76s -> 6523.36s]  I just I keep getting there and forgetting the entire video game.
[6524.85s -> 6526.75s]  I'm just like, yeah, jump, jump, jump.
[6526.75s -> 6527.05s]  How do I?
[6527.05s -> 6527.75s]  I don't know the buttons.
[6527.75s -> 6528.35s]  How do I play?
[6560.50s -> 6561.50s]  No, I need to jump.
[6561.60s -> 6562.10s]  Oh my God.
[6562.10s -> 6563.10s]  I'm about to skip the level.
[6569.51s -> 6571.51s]  I know there's a hand over there, but I want to do I wanted to get it
[6571.51s -> 6572.21s]  without the hand.
[6591.61s -> 6592.71s]  Does that even save time?
[6593.31s -> 6593.81s]  Hard to tell.
[6597.09s -> 6597.79s]  That was stupid.
[6597.79s -> 6598.69s]  That was really stupid.
[6598.69s -> 6599.79s]  That was so stupid.
[6605.18s -> 6606.58s]  I'm just not just go just go to go.
[6606.58s -> 6607.88s]  I'm going to get stuck here for like four hours.
[6607.88s -> 6608.98s]  Just go just end it.
[6644.51s -> 6645.51s]  Excuse me.
[6646.55s -> 6647.35s]  That's got to be platinum.
[6647.95s -> 6649.25s]  They didn't even break a sweat.
[6651.66s -> 6652.96s]  Excuse me.
[6653.73s -> 6655.93s]  It's been exclaiming random loud sounds today.
[6660.22s -> 6662.72s]  I'll give it one or two more attempts because this one was fun.
[6670.60s -> 6671.60s]  That was that was yucky.
[6675.33s -> 6675.83s]  What was that?
[6696.89s -> 6698.39s]  Okay, I'm done.
[6698.39s -> 6698.69s]  I'm done.
[6698.69s -> 6698.99s]  I'm done.
[6698.99s -> 6699.19s]  I'm done.
[6719.00s -> 6719.80s]  Oh, shut up.
[6719.80s -> 6720.80s]  That's so stupid.
[6720.80s -> 6722.30s]  That lip should not be as loud.
[6722.30s -> 6722.80s]  You know what I mean?
[6723.96s -> 6724.56s]  That was dumb.
[6744.34s -> 6745.54s]  Oh, I thought I had one more.
[6745.74s -> 6747.54s]  Oh, this game just hurts my brain.
[6749.94s -> 6750.94s]  I thought I had one more dash.
[6752.32s -> 6753.42s]  Oh, now it's all falling apart.
[6753.62s -> 6754.42s]  I'm gonna just keep going.
[6777.02s -> 6777.82s]  What the fuck?
[6777.82s -> 6779.12s]  I didn't land.
[6798.71s -> 6802.41s]  Stupid game actually stupid games that like how come on.
[6812.38s -> 6813.98s]  I should have went through annoying.
[6834.50s -> 6835.60s]  Oh, shut up.
[6835.70s -> 6838.30s]  That's why I didn't have to because sometimes things stupid.
[6839.26s -> 6840.86s]  What the fuck happened there?
[6841.54s -> 6842.44s]  What happened there?
[6842.84s -> 6843.54s]  What happened?
[6843.64s -> 6844.84s]  Why did I not launch?
[6850.76s -> 6852.16s]  I should why did I not hit the barrel?
[6856.82s -> 6857.62s]  Gamer fatigue.
[6857.92s -> 6859.22s]  This is gamer fatigue for sure.
[6859.92s -> 6860.52s]  A hundred percent.
[6879.19s -> 6879.69s]  Here we go.
[6887.85s -> 6889.55s]  I had the other dash.
[6890.15s -> 6891.25s]  I had the other dash.
[6891.25s -> 6892.15s]  I just didn't use it.
[6892.15s -> 6892.55s]  All right.
[6892.55s -> 6892.95s]  Come on.
[6892.95s -> 6893.55s]  This is the one.
[6917.33s -> 6921.53s]  Why did he not hit the barrel rewind it and play it a thousand times in a row?
[6931.01s -> 6933.21s]  The barrel is a gigantic pit box.
[6933.21s -> 6934.11s]  How am I not hitting it?
[6954.69s -> 6955.49s]  That's got to be it.
[6956.26s -> 6957.36s]  Oh, you got to be kidding me.
[6961.53s -> 6964.63s]  Oh, I can do it.
[6966.56s -> 6967.86s]  It's just like walk up the edge.
[6978.46s -> 6979.16s]  Oh, shut up.
[7002.14s -> 7003.64s]  Fuck you.
[7003.64s -> 7004.34s]  Oh my God.
[7010.95s -> 7011.35s]  I move on.
[7024.84s -> 7025.14s]  All right.
[7025.14s -> 7026.24s]  I think I missed a few people.
[7051.33s -> 7059.67s]  Oh, I'll take it.
[7059.97s -> 7060.37s]  I'll take it.
[7060.37s -> 7060.67s]  I'll take it.
[7060.67s -> 7060.97s]  I'll take it.
[7060.97s -> 7061.37s]  I'll take it.
[7064.58s -> 7065.38s]  How do you like the break?
[7065.38s -> 7067.08s]  I'll always do this soundtrack is great.
[7075.34s -> 7077.44s]  Oh, I was so close.
[7100.65s -> 7102.05s]  I'm trying to go so fast.
[7136.00s -> 7137.60s]  Yes, that's how it's done.
[7138.30s -> 7138.60s]  All right.
[7138.60s -> 7139.60s]  That's a good one to go out on.
[7146.93s -> 7147.93s]  Your addiction is showing.
[7149.44s -> 7153.04s]  I understand why a lot of you like this game.
[7166.56s -> 7167.66s]  I'm kind of freaking out, but it's okay.
[7167.66s -> 7168.16s]  It working.
[7190.66s -> 7191.26s]  That's not good.
[7200.58s -> 7202.38s]  See, I keep I fell off that one last time too.
[7226.01s -> 7234.27s]  Oh fuck better.
[7235.04s -> 7240.87s]  Yeah, you haven't beaten Tomar in a single level.
[7242.19s -> 7242.59s]  Yeah.
[7244.20s -> 7244.90s]  Have I not?
[7249.53s -> 7250.63s]  Well, whatever.
[7250.83s -> 7251.43s]  That's all right.
[7254.50s -> 7256.20s]  21.3.
[7257.59s -> 7264.69s]  Bro, you're a snail.
[7268.20s -> 7271.40s]  Do you think heaven has any hot springs we could soak in?
[7278.82s -> 7280.12s]  That's for a dead guy, huh?
[7283.59s -> 7284.89s]  Not skipping because I want to.
[7284.89s -> 7289.88s]  I'm skipping because I'm skipping the toilet or whatever.
[7292.61s -> 7295.61s]  Looks like the believers are late to their own damn sermon.
[7303.30s -> 7304.30s]  I'd feel weird.
[7306.30s -> 7307.30s]  Come here often.
[7308.00s -> 7309.60s]  Wait, we're not skipping this part.
[7309.60s -> 7311.00s]  Just one of my little jokes.
[7311.30s -> 7313.40s]  Sinners have a great sense of humor.
[7313.40s -> 7316.00s]  You must have had quite an idyllic childhood.
[7316.00s -> 7318.60s]  Anyway, you know your way around heaven, right?
[7321.78s -> 7324.88s]  If you fight green, you will absolutely lose.
[7330.01s -> 7338.39s]  I think I figured out what was going on and that's the end of the stream.
[7338.39s -> 7339.09s]  Thanks for watching.
[7342.76s -> 7345.86s]  I know that a lot of you saying that he's never going to play this game again,
[7347.48s -> 7348.88s]  but I think I might disagree with you.
[7355.36s -> 7356.86s]  I feel like I'm having fun with this one.
[7359.90s -> 7363.50s]  But let's go over the remainder of the week coming up here.
[7365.93s -> 7371.40s]  So next time I stream will probably be on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[7371.80s -> 7373.53s]  I'm going to do Sorcery Part 4.
[7374.78s -> 7379.36s]  And then at some point during the weekend, I'd imagine probably Tuesday.
[7382.66s -> 7385.52s]  Tuesday around this time, five or six.
[7388.25s -> 7392.59s]  And then this weekend coming up, really going to try to get the Man vs.
[7392.59s -> 7393.39s]  Machine stuff going.
[7394.70s -> 7398.34s]  So that weekend of the 18th, 19th, 20th, there are other streamers.
[7398.34s -> 7401.44s]  I need to make sure everyone can do the same day because I know that some
[7401.88s -> 7408.49s]  scheduling conflicts exist somewhere in that Saturday, Sunday.
[7408.69s -> 7412.19s]  Really want to if a bunch of the people can't do it that I really want to play
[7412.19s -> 7414.19s]  it with and we'll figure it out.
[7415.02s -> 7415.72s]  We'll move it around.
[7417.24s -> 7422.12s]  But Sorcery Part 4 on Tuesday starting around five or six o'clock at night.
[7425.85s -> 7428.45s]  And we'll do MVM that end of the weekend there.
[7434.75s -> 7435.85s]  And maybe I'll play this again.
[7436.44s -> 7437.84s]  Just kind of hanging out one night.
[7443.21s -> 7445.01s]  Yeah, I'm very excited for Man vs.
[7445.01s -> 7445.41s]  Machine.
[7446.91s -> 7448.01s]  I've not played Man vs.
[7448.01s -> 7450.11s]  Machine in a really, really long time.
[7454.68s -> 7458.51s]  Getting a bunch of streamer buddies in there should be a lot of fun.
[7458.61s -> 7461.31s]  Especially the harder ones because that TF2 Man vs.
[7461.31s -> 7464.94s]  Machine, some of those tours are really, really hard.
[7465.24s -> 7466.04s]  They don't mess around.
[7478.49s -> 7479.89s]  Wave 666.
[7479.89s -> 7480.99s]  I don't know about that.
[7492.24s -> 7492.94s]  Take care of yourselves.
[7492.94s -> 7493.74s]  Thanks for watching.
[7494.89s -> 7499.79s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday for Sorcery Part 4.
[7500.84s -> 7503.54s]  Sorcery Enjoyers have been waiting a long time.
[7506.16s -> 7510.03s]  So let's feed them to feed the Sorcery 4 Andes.
[7515.34s -> 7517.04s]  I told you I wasn't going to wait that long.
[7518.69s -> 7520.99s]  We're not going to finish it on Tuesday, but we'll start it.
[7521.56s -> 7524.16s]  We take us three or four sessions to do it.
[7535.84s -> 7536.84s]  Yeah, take care.
[7538.60s -> 7539.50s]  Play viewfinder.
[7540.42s -> 7543.72s]  Yeah, I'll find time to throw in just like a chill stream again.
[7545.99s -> 7547.39s]  I think most of them are chill streams now.
[7549.59s -> 7550.29s]  I like it though.
[7551.12s -> 7552.82s]  Having a lot of fun doing this.
[7553.02s -> 7556.58s]  I'm back to the basics.
[7563.79s -> 7565.09s]  Baldur's Gate 3.
[7565.09s -> 7565.69s]  I don't know.
[7565.69s -> 7566.49s]  Maybe.
[7567.48s -> 7569.28s]  All your streams are evil.
[7571.35s -> 7571.95s]  Evil.
[7574.92s -> 7575.42s]  Agree.
[7579.63s -> 7581.33s]  Evil was capital by the way.
[7581.73s -> 7582.13s]  Evil.
[7588.46s -> 7589.46s]  Yeah, take care of yourselves.
[7590.00s -> 7591.20s]  Have a great weekend.
[7593.53s -> 7594.13s]  See you on Tuesday.
[7599.60s -> 7600.80s]  Voices of the Void.
[7601.00s -> 7602.40s]  What is Voices of the Void?
[7603.26s -> 7603.86s]  Is it a new game?
[7614.60s -> 7615.40s]  Great game.
[7621.82s -> 7622.52s]  Look into it.
[7622.82s -> 7624.12s]  And I don't mean that in quotes.
[7624.62s -> 7625.82s]  I'm actually going to look into it.
[7629.76s -> 7630.26s]  All right guys.
[7630.36s -> 7630.86s]  See you later.
[7632.36s -> 7632.86s]  Call your mother.
[7634.61s -> 7635.31s]  Call your father too.
[7638.60s -> 7638.90s]  You know what?
[7639.00s -> 7640.90s]  Get everybody in the room and play Monopoly.
[7641.00s -> 7642.10s]  When was the last time you played Monopoly?
[7645.10s -> 7649.59s]  Play Monopoly.
[7649.69s -> 7650.19s]  It's 1 a.m.
[7650.19s -> 7651.09s]  They're all asleep.
[7651.89s -> 7652.49s]  Call them tomorrow.
[7655.08s -> 7655.38s]  All right.
[7655.58s -> 7656.08s]  See you guys later.
[7656.18s -> 7664.70s]  Goodbye.
