[0.31s -> 23.88s]  Do I seriously have to immediately stop playing this game? Because of me having to vomit?
[23.88s -> 25.88s]  Alright, well let's just get...
[25.88s -> 36.97s]  Oh no. No. You can't even see everything. It's like 2D on 3D.
[36.97s -> 44.04s]  Like, I have no depth perception. I can't even tell what... am I close to this thing or am I far away from it? Let's find out.
[44.04s -> 48.78s]  I guess I was pretty close. Okay, let's just go this... can I jump?
[48.78s -> 50.78s]  Oh, okay I can jump.
[50.78s -> 54.81s]  Sick jump. What the hell is that?
[54.81s -> 58.39s]  What the fuck are those things?
[58.39s -> 64.49s]  What are these, like, little muppet things? These little, like, weevils?
[64.49s -> 68.44s]  Can these hurt me?
[68.44s -> 72.79s]  It's...
[72.79s -> 75.61s]  Okay, can I jump on them?
[75.61s -> 77.61s]  I don't think so.
[77.61s -> 79.61s]  Come on, last try.
[81.61s -> 85.61s]  Okay, it's very evident that I can't do anything with these things.
[85.61s -> 89.61s]  These, like, daffy duck green, like, mob and mosh and things, alright?
[89.61s -> 93.00s]  Let's just keep going. Apparently I touched him again.
[99.06s -> 102.20s]  I love how... did you guys hear that?
[102.20s -> 106.20s]  Aren't these game designers wonderful?
[106.20s -> 110.20s]  Is what that thing just said. Aren't these game designers wonderful?
[110.20s -> 112.38s]  I think that was a joke. That was a pretty good joke.
[112.38s -> 120.31s]  Considering this game probably gave horrible nightmares to a bunch of kids that played it.
[120.31s -> 122.31s]  I never played this back in the day.
[122.31s -> 129.35s]  I don't even know... did this ever even release? I don't even remember this being on store shelves.
[129.35s -> 131.35s]  Good grab. Oh, good animations.
[131.35s -> 136.28s]  Can I jump over this wall?
[136.28s -> 138.28s]  What are the point of these enemies if they can't move?
[138.28s -> 140.28s]  What the fuck was that?
[140.28s -> 143.28s]  He's, like, spitting at me like a Jurassic Park spitter.
[143.28s -> 148.59s]  Get me out of here.
[148.59s -> 150.59s]  Get that spitter away from me.
[152.59s -> 155.33s]  Oh, I'm invincible.
[157.33s -> 160.53s]  Oh my god.
[160.53s -> 165.05s]  How am I supposed to move this? Can I grab this rocket?
[165.05s -> 170.54s]  Can I even change the camera?
[170.54s -> 173.71s]  Dude, is this thing moving very slowly?
[173.71s -> 175.71s]  I feel like it is, but I have no perception at all.
[175.71s -> 178.71s]  So I don't even know what's happening. I don't even know if anything's even going on.
[178.71s -> 180.71s]  If I'm gonna run into this rocket and see what happens.
[180.71s -> 188.86s]  What? I have one really important question for you guys.
[188.86s -> 191.30s]  You don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but I just really need to...
[191.30s -> 195.24s]  Need a clip. Good clip. Need a clip.
[195.24s -> 197.24s]  You like that clip? Need a clip.
[197.24s -> 200.63s]  Hi, Gemma. I didn't get the joke.
[200.63s -> 202.63s]  Star! Hey, everybody, Star is in the video!
[202.63s -> 204.63s]  Whoa! Whoa!
[204.63s -> 208.90s]  My, like, parents are, like, yelling down here.
[210.90s -> 212.90s]  They think I'm, like, in trouble.
[212.90s -> 216.80s]  Hold on a second. This might be funny.
[216.80s -> 218.80s]  This could be, like, pretty funny.
[218.80s -> 223.17s]  Come on, come down here. Aren't you concerned that your, like, son just got in trouble?
[223.17s -> 225.98s]  Whoa!
[225.98s -> 233.71s]  No!
[233.71s -> 236.71s]  Game over! Fuck you, game over!
[236.71s -> 239.64s]  Need a clip? Good clip.
[239.64s -> 240.64s]  Do you want to continue?
[240.64s -> 243.01s]  Uh, I kind of have to continue because I need a clip.
[243.01s -> 245.01s]  Want to continue? Good to continue.
[245.01s -> 248.76s]  Good to continue. Need to continue? Good to continue.
[248.76s -> 251.76s]  Oh, I know all the strats. You see, now I can speedrun this.
[251.76s -> 255.76s]  World record's going to be two minutes and 35 seconds.
[255.76s -> 257.76s]  There it is. Look at that.
[257.76s -> 259.76s]  That's what we call a speedrun. See?
[259.76s -> 261.76s]  I wanted to do that because I could jump down.
[261.76s -> 264.26s]  Speedrun. This way.
[264.26s -> 268.26s]  Touch that arrow because, you know, it gives you an extra one up.
[268.26s -> 270.26s]  Go this way. That's my split.
[270.26s -> 273.43s]  All right, I'm 20 minutes ahead of the world record. Let's go.
[277.13s -> 279.13s]  Okay, it goes right... Oh, my God. I'm going to beat the world record.
[282.67s -> 285.62s]  Jeremy, are you okay?
[285.62s -> 287.62s]  What's happening down there?
[287.62s -> 289.62s]  Are you in trouble? Are you sick?
[289.62s -> 293.44s]  Is the dog okay?
[293.44s -> 296.44s]  No, Mom. It's okay. I'm just playing Bubsy 3D.
[296.44s -> 298.81s]  The shittiest game I've ever played.
[298.81s -> 302.12s]  Oh, okay. Well, I'm glad.
[302.12s -> 304.12s]  And is that the Chester Cheeto on the screen?
[304.12s -> 306.12s]  No, Mom.
[306.12s -> 308.12s]  Chester Cheeto. It's Bubsy.
[308.12s -> 310.12s]  The lovable Bubsy. Oh, I've never seen that cartoon.
[310.12s -> 312.12s]  It's not a cartoon, Mom.
[312.12s -> 314.73s]  Geez.
[314.73s -> 318.57s]  See what you just made me do, Mom?
[318.57s -> 320.57s]  He just appeared.
[320.57s -> 322.57s]  That guy just, like, appeared.
[322.57s -> 325.06s]  Or I'm an idiot. I'm not sure.
[325.06s -> 327.06s]  Well, you should have been... Mom, you don't have to be a backseat gamer, okay?
[327.06s -> 330.26s]  I know what I'm doing.
[330.26s -> 332.26s]  See, I have to go this way. I'm still...
[332.26s -> 337.32s]  I'm going to, like, puke.
[337.32s -> 341.32s]  So, those of you that are asking why this video ends up being, like, four or five minutes,
[341.32s -> 343.32s]  it's because I'm out for your sake.
[343.32s -> 345.32s]  I don't want you to puke.
[345.32s -> 347.50s]  Because, like, I'm going to puke.
[347.50s -> 349.93s]  In fact, I think I already did puke.
[349.93s -> 352.74s]  I just, like, cut the video. You saw that cut.
[352.74s -> 354.74s]  I puked. All right? You want to know the truth?
[354.74s -> 357.24s]  I fucking puked.
[359.67s -> 361.67s]  Whoa!
[361.67s -> 364.30s]  Right when I talk about puking.
[366.92s -> 368.92s]  Oh, stop doing that and just wait and be patient.
[368.92s -> 373.21s]  That thing is making so much noise.
[373.21s -> 376.34s]  Can I please just be level one?
[376.34s -> 378.90s]  If I complete level one, I'll be happy.
[378.90s -> 382.42s]  Just wait it out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[382.42s -> 385.69s]  Okay, go.
[385.69s -> 389.02s]  I think I just beat level one.
[389.02s -> 397.77s]  Nice, like, cutscene.
[399.77s -> 401.77s]  Whoa, this is getting wacky.
[401.77s -> 404.01s]  Whoa!
[404.01s -> 406.50s]  He got squashed.
[406.50s -> 408.50s]  Did you see that, guys? Bubsy just got squashed.
[408.50s -> 411.19s]  Let's move on to level two.
[414.65s -> 416.65s]  And by move on to level two, I mean, like, end the video.
