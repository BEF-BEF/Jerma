[4.60s -> 15.50s]  Whoever knows where they're going, or where they'll be, whoever can see the rainfall on a misty Sunday afternoon.
[15.50s -> 26.69s]  You see, I write poetry. Could you give me a line or two from your favorite poem?
[26.69s -> 29.93s]  Please, please tell me it's Robert Frost.
[29.93s -> 46.43s]  Hey, it's me. It's me. I found you guys again.

[53.34s -> 55.77s]  I'm kneeling in the back.
[55.77s -> 58.90s]  Are you guys running?
[58.90s -> 63.10s]  You guys are doing a running animation.
[63.10s -> 65.60s]  Oh no.
[65.60s -> 71.40s]  My dad can be up your dad.
[71.40s -> 73.40s]  Watch out, there's a guy behind you.
[73.40s -> 81.45s]  Oh god, the guy is shooting at me.

[108.98s -> 113.98s]  Oh, jeez. Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[113.98s -> 122.12s]  When the plague hit, all kinds of shit went down. Even guys with their trucks thought they could go through anything.
[122.12s -> 125.74s]  Turns out, that's not entirely true.
[126.74s -> 132.29s]  There were two brothers, but ever since the plague hit, they haven't been seen for months.
[132.29s -> 135.29s]  It's too bad. I'd really go for a slice right now.
[135.29s -> 139.29s]  God, I remember this bridge. I used to cross this bridge every day.
[139.29s -> 141.91s]  That's before the plague hit.
[141.91s -> 144.91s]  See, traffic on there used to be pretty bad.
[144.91s -> 146.91s]  Wish I could drive in that traffic now.
[146.91s -> 149.60s]  That's back before the plague hit.
[149.60s -> 152.90s]  Lucy's Diner. I had my first kiss here.
[152.90s -> 155.72s]  That's before the plague hit.
[155.72s -> 160.96s]  I remember her hair. She had the brightest blonde hair you've ever seen.
[160.96s -> 162.96s]  God, that memory always makes me laugh.
[162.96s -> 165.52s]  We used to come here every Saturday.
[165.52s -> 167.53s]  The memory of her hair?
[167.53s -> 170.60s]  I don't know. That's before the plague hit.
[170.60s -> 177.13s]  Oh, there's a guy on the bridge.
[177.13s -> 181.13s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy.
[181.13s -> 184.13s]  You don't got much ammunition for that gun. Don't waste it on tubes.

[186.13s -> 188.13s]  I got like a bow.
[188.13s -> 192.13s]  There's a guy behind you too. Watch out. He's coming up on the other side.
[192.13s -> 199.06s]  Guy coming up behind you. I just like shit. He just like shot a gun
[199.06s -> 202.52s]  I was like a knee-jerk reaction. Can this guy talk to?

[223.14s -> 235.15s]  You there you must answer my three questions. That's not a question. You dare punch the fire troll
