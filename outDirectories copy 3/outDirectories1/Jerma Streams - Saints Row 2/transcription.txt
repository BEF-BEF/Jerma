[7.80s -> 36.14s]  That title sucks. I forgot to change the title. Hold on, one second. I'm drawing a blank.
[36.70s -> 44.84s]  The VOD is permanently titled this? I don't know. What should I make it? I'm drawing a blank.
[48.95s -> 58.90s]  Call it Saints Row Poo. That's worse than this one. I got my iced coffee. I'm ready to go.
[59.78s -> 69.51s]  Sorry about that. I had to take a phone call. The easiest fucking way to get out of anything.
[70.92s -> 74.20s]  What could that phone call be? Was that phone call important?
[76.50s -> 81.78s]  Was that phone call somebody you had to talk to? Immediately? You don't know. You have no idea.
[89.51s -> 97.26s]  No, I'm not. I'm fucking around. I've got my wasabi soy sauce. Almond here. Just in case I need a
[97.26s -> 110.33s]  snack. What's wrong? I'm fine. Soy sauce. I actually don't like soy sauce. Okay. Let's go over what's
[110.33s -> 121.08s]  going on today. In the next couple, maybe a couple weeks. So hold on. I gotta move stuff around. I
[121.08s -> 127.98s]  just was not fucking prepared at all. But like I said, I'm not like all these other streamers.
[128.54s -> 133.10s]  Okay. It's time for the defense here. You ready for the defense? I've said it a thousand times.
[134.33s -> 140.73s]  So when, when, when, when all the other streamers turn their streams on, they usually have like at
[140.73s -> 147.29s]  least 15 to 30 minute countdown before the stream actually starts. See, I get here. I just turn it
[147.29s -> 152.49s]  on and fucking I'm not even ready. You know, I am the countdown. This is the countdown right now.
[154.87s -> 162.12s]  It's me. I am such an egomaniac and I'm so full of myself that even when I'm not supposed to have
[162.12s -> 173.82s]  the stream on, I'm streaming here talking to you as the waiting room. All right, we're gonna play
[173.82s -> 181.02s]  Saints Row 2 today. I've never played any of the Saints Row games with a asterisk on it.
[181.66s -> 189.48s]  Aster and I played Saints Row 2 for like an hour or two hours or something. We got through the
[189.48s -> 195.69s]  character creator and then we just kind of stopped like an hour or two later. So I've never played
[195.69s -> 199.21s]  any of these all the way through or even halfway through or even a third of the way through.
[200.01s -> 210.39s]  I remember that video. Yeah, we also have a mod. I have the gentleman of the row mod installed,
[211.11s -> 220.92s]  which I guess fixes the whole game somehow. You're a fake fan. What do you mean?
[221.64s -> 230.55s]  Saints Row 2 is literally the best game ever. Okay, well, find out. I didn't even tweet this.
[231.27s -> 244.38s]  Give me one second. I hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving. Did you celebrate it? I did. I made
[245.18s -> 249.67s]  a 25 pound turkey because I wanted to make sure I had leftovers for two or three months
[250.63s -> 254.87s]  because I freeze essentially more than two-thirds of the entire bird.
[256.47s -> 263.99s]  What is that sound? What's going on? Am I getting played off the stage?
[266.04s -> 275.94s]  What's playing? What's playing me off the stage right now? What's going on? Oh,
[275.94s -> 280.47s]  shit. This is DMCA music. Hold on. Why? Hold on. Why was this not playing earlier?
[281.11s -> 295.66s]  This was not playing earlier. I've had Saints Row 2 open for 12 straight minutes. Audio, music,
[295.66s -> 301.11s]  volume. Should I turn music volume to zero? That's so boring though. Well, that's not boring.
[301.11s -> 307.14s]  That's how I live my life. All right, let me turn my fan down. It's going pretty hard here,
[307.14s -> 313.14s]  but something really important to know is... I didn't even know this is coming out this soon,
[313.14s -> 321.05s]  I guess. Monster Rancher 1 and 2 remake is out in less than two weeks. I hope you guys understand
[321.05s -> 327.05s]  that whatever you followed this channel for, whether it was for... Oh, I like when he does
[327.05s -> 332.17s]  like the big stream stuff. That's never happening ever again. Once Monster Rancher 1 and 2 comes out,
[332.17s -> 336.09s]  I'm only going to play that game. I will fill that category for the rest of the time I stream.
[336.73s -> 347.00s]  It's a lie, by the way. I have plenty of shit planned. It's based. Yeah, I know. All right.
[347.00s -> 360.30s]  No more fucking around. No more stalling. Let's go. Let me tweet. Saints Row 2. But honestly,
[360.30s -> 363.74s]  no, all jokes aside, I'm going to play that game a lot. I played it a lot when
[364.38s -> 370.38s]  we did the PlayStation 1 stuff, but I'm very curious how they're going to handle the CD thing.
[371.26s -> 380.97s]  I didn't... Did anybody know? What are they going to do? You know what I said, and unfortunately,
[380.97s -> 389.48s]  nobody listened to me. They have a built-in database. It should have been URLs. Somebody
[389.48s -> 393.80s]  steal that from me, please. Like, but give me 5% of all the revenue of every... of the whole project.
[394.68s -> 406.66s]  URLs would have been fucking hilarious, wouldn't it have? The link here.
[407.54s -> 417.82s]  Okay. All right. I'm ready. You're ready to sit in, like, for an hour in the character creator?
[417.82s -> 424.38s]  Because you know we're going to. Because part of this mod increases the body sliders by, like, 500%.
[425.85s -> 437.18s]  So, well, welcome to the stream. All right. I'm ready to go. Okay. Here we go. New game.
[437.18s -> 444.10s]  Is there a... There's probably a... I'm assuming there's probably a opening cutscene. I think there
[444.10s -> 449.90s]  is. All right. Hopefully this is not too loud. If it's not, let me know. If it is, then don't,
[449.90s -> 455.29s]  then don't tell me. Okay. Go. I'm not playing on hardcore. Why would you play, like, a GTA game
[455.29s -> 477.88s]  on hardcore? Oh, that was... That hurt my head. It's way too dank.
[478.68s -> 482.36s]  You know, I just found out what that was two days ago.
[497.96s -> 500.36s]  I know. I'll fix it in a minute.
[500.84s -> 502.20s]  Do you think it's going to kill the framerate?
[507.00s -> 510.36s]  I have the Gentleman of the Road mod, which can fix a lot of problems.
[523.24s -> 524.44s]  We can't even hear you.
[524.68s -> 531.10s]  Not yet. But I'm about to take the... I know my audio. I know. I'm... Okay. Every time I try to
[531.10s -> 537.61s]  fix my audio system, it fucks up. All right. Hold on. You understand? I always hear... I'm looking
[537.61s -> 545.69s]  over at my OBS right now, and I see the microphone. I see, like, the... the waveform, right? That,
[545.69s -> 552.65s]  right now, is bright fucking red. And if it goes any louder, it's gonna... So I don't understand how
[552.65s -> 560.50s]  to fix it. Everybody talks about how quiet I am, but according to my... my computer, it's fucking,
[560.50s -> 565.54s]  like, barely... If I talk any... If this goes any louder, it's gonna be like... It's gonna blow out
[565.54s -> 572.78s]  your ears. It's gonna peak. I don't get it. I don't understand why. I think it's this microphone. I
[572.78s -> 576.30s]  think this... this microphone is a really good mic. But I don't think it was ever designed to be
[576.30s -> 586.47s]  plugged in to, like, do what I'm doing. Clip that noise. Don't do that. Idiot. You idiot. Okay,
[586.47s -> 593.08s]  hold on. Let me turn the game down a little. This should be a bit of right there. Okay.
[593.08s -> 600.57s]  So, we have to figure out... What do I want to do with this? Okay. Uh, I'm gonna try to make me.
[601.21s -> 611.35s]  No, not exit. Holy shit, there's a... There's a dick. No, it's not. Oh my god. Right. Right. Okay.
[611.35s -> 627.78s]  We're fine. Okay. Hold on. So, the sliders have been increased by about two to three hundred percent.
[627.78s -> 635.43s]  This is current German. Yeah. All right. Wait a minute. How come it's giving me these... Okay.
[635.43s -> 651.74s]  Why the... Where's the button prompts? All right. Body shape. Okay. I feel... This is just... I feel
[651.74s -> 660.98s]  like I'm in a Ninja Turtle costume. I don't know why. Why am I seeing that? I don't get it.
[660.98s -> 673.32s]  Why did I just say that? How much age should we have? All right. I don't want to go too overboard
[673.32s -> 678.04s]  because we have to live with this for the whole rest of the entire time I played this game.
[678.04s -> 688.10s]  You just made E. Honda. Should we be jacked fat? No. I can't just put all the sliders to the right.
[688.10s -> 717.75s]  That's so easy. Oh no. I can't. This is the back of the head? I'm just gonna make, like, a fucking
[718.47s -> 733.22s]  banana split head. Tyler won. I can't. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. What you meant to say is...
[733.22s -> 736.74s]  You didn't mean to say Tyler won. What you meant to say was one of the greatest Twitch
[736.74s -> 741.42s]  interactive entertainers on the platform is what you meant to say. Make sure you get it right next
[741.42s -> 759.40s]  time. Oh my goodness. That's the... That's not my hair. That's my head. Where's the brain? I don't
[759.40s -> 768.01s]  know. I don't think it exists. This is the neck? Hold on. It looks like somebody's cutting down a
[768.01s -> 776.57s]  tree. It's on the trunk. I don't know if I like that. I'm gonna have to change that, I think.
[776.57s -> 785.51s]  All right. Should I make his head a serving platter? Like a gravy boat? Because that's
[785.51s -> 800.84s]  what's happening. I mean, it just was Thanksgiving. Oh my god. He's wearing a baseball bat. A baseball
[800.84s -> 807.88s]  hat of his own head. A baseball bat? He's wearing a baseball hat of his own head. I said that wrong,
[807.88s -> 817.69s]  but you know what I mean. Somebody can ride his head? How wide? Should be not that wide.
[818.41s -> 824.68s]  I like it like this. At least for now. I might have to go back and fix it, though.
[829.27s -> 850.49s]  This is just Peter Pettigrew. He's so mad. Well, now he is. I kind of like it like this.
[850.49s -> 862.41s]  This is a beer. Maybe it will reduce the weight. Maybe it will reduce the fatness.
[862.41s -> 872.66s]  Oh, I like that. It's scary. Big and bushy or small and scary, what do you think?
[872.66s -> 880.79s]  It's the guy that can survive the car crash. It is. What was that guy's name? It was... What was it?
[881.43s -> 887.64s]  What was that guy's name? It was the... It was the thing they made in the CG program that could
[887.64s -> 895.22s]  actually survive a car crash. It had like a gram. That's right. Hold on. Yeah, I can't alt-tab this
[895.22s -> 909.90s]  game because it breaks. Look up gram. Car crash. I like that. I think angry is better, though.
[909.90s -> 917.30s]  I want to see the eyes. I don't want to lose the eyes. Real tragedy. No, I'm not saying look...
[917.30s -> 923.74s]  I'm not saying look up this person that... Whatever. It actually is Peter Pettigrew now.
[923.74s -> 931.46s]  Well, it would make sense to make that person because I'm probably going to get a bunch of
[931.46s -> 943.46s]  car crashes. No, I didn't say look up car crash on Google. I said look up car crash gram. It's a
[943.46s -> 959.21s]  very specific thing to look up. All right, that's okay. Eyes. This is important. I can't.
[959.21s -> 977.21s]  He looks like he could survive. Hmm. Randomize. I don't want to randomize it. He has a part in his
[977.21s -> 987.45s]  hair. Yeah, the part is a little bit further back on his skull. That's so weird. Okay, we'll keep
[987.45s -> 1007.30s]  that. No, we won't. How about this? No. Really deep eyes. I have eyes like this. I kind of like it.
[1008.20s -> 1013.26s]  Not that low, though. I want to be able to see all those features. I do? Yeah, I have really deep
[1013.26s -> 1023.48s]  set eyes. They go really far back. Yeah, my eyes are so far back set into my head that they're
[1023.48s -> 1029.14s]  kind of close to my brain. So if I kind of push in my eyes very gently, like the last episode of
[1029.14s -> 1038.89s]  SpongeBob plays, it's just like... Like weird shit happens. Like I'm pushing on like the frontal lobe
[1038.89s -> 1046.63s]  of my brain when I do it. Like, okay, I'm going to do it. Someone was just speaking French. There
[1046.63s -> 1050.87s]  was a guy just speaking French holding like a big dinner plate. He was like serving it. I don't know.
[1050.87s -> 1071.18s]  Let me work on my guy, please. This is what you look like. Why do you... You don't think I know
[1071.18s -> 1094.63s]  that? Oh, boy. No, I want to see the eyes. Maybe not that big. Like this. Even anime eyes. Yeah.
[1099.34s -> 1107.98s]  Stop being rude. Oh, you're talking about other people, not me. Okay, ears. Should you just not
[1107.98s -> 1125.88s]  have ears? Maybe you just shouldn't have them. All right, those ears are where a fish's ears are.
[1125.88s -> 1137.83s]  No, that's where a bird's ears are. That's fine. I like it. Ears are cringe anyways. Get rid of them.
[1137.83s -> 1159.72s]  What? That's fine. No, that's all right. Like that. Ear openness. That's weird. Ear roll?
[1161.37s -> 1168.68s]  No, I don't want to mess with the ears too much because mess with the hair. Just really huge lobes.
[1168.68s -> 1195.90s]  No. An elf. Make him an elven. I kind of like the elven. Maybe not that extreme. It's a wood elf.
[1195.90s -> 1217.32s]  Okay. Cheekbones. Maybe not that much. How about temple depth? What is that doing? Temple height.
[1217.32s -> 1225.93s]  I like it higher. That's not bad. No, no, no, no. It's definitely going to be over here somewhere
[1225.93s -> 1237.64s]  like here. Cheekbone depth. No, way too. Put them in. That's not bad. Maybe a little bit out. That's
[1237.64s -> 1254.34s]  fine. Eye cheekbones are low. That's all right. Why does he look like Cartman? It does look like
[1254.34s -> 1261.66s]  Eric Cartman. Yeah, just wait for when South Park does all grown up like the Rugrats did. And this
[1261.66s -> 1276.55s]  is what they're going to get. They just did that. They did? Oh, shit. I did not know that. They're
[1276.55s -> 1281.85s]  literally doing that right now. They just did that. They did that literally, literally in the
[1281.85s -> 1293.72s]  new special. Does he look like this? I don't want these to be that. No, no, no. Pull these back.
[1293.72s -> 1299.10s]  That's like way too comical. You know what I mean? Like, oh, that's so funny. No, no, no. That's
[1299.10s -> 1307.50s]  too comical. It needs to be a little bit dialed back here. The chin is messed up too. That's got
[1307.50s -> 1324.52s]  to get fixed. Nose. Big or small nose? Probably small. We want the other features in the face to
[1324.52s -> 1349.86s]  really, really pop. Yeah, small. No, no, no. Not big. He has extra nostrils. No, that's too comical.
[1349.86s -> 1367.18s]  I think like right, right where it was is good. I like that. All right. Now imagine if I could take
[1367.18s -> 1377.21s]  this guy into Dark Souls. That would be great. I feel like that's what I'm doing. Put it up high?
[1377.21s -> 1386.94s]  No, no, no, no. Not high. It looks like the imprint of somebody's shoe is on the front of his face.
[1386.94s -> 1392.49s]  Like this guy had a normal face and then like in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, somebody with a boot came
[1392.49s -> 1399.16s]  and kicked him in the face as hard as they could. That's the imprint of a shoe from the forehead to
[1399.16s -> 1417.38s]  the chin. We don't got to get too finicky with the nose. Looks like Trump. It looks like a Trump
[1417.38s -> 1438.41s]  caricature. No, I don't like what that just did. No, I don't like what that did either. Right here
[1438.41s -> 1450.23s]  in the middle. Keep it in the middle. His nose is way too pushed in to have any of these other
[1450.23s -> 1463.43s]  settings mean anything at all. All right, that's fine. Mouth. He just doesn't have any teeth.
[1464.14s -> 1502.46s]  He just have no teeth. I like it. That's okay. It's his grandma. It's like an open mouth. Not that.
[1502.46s -> 1517.78s]  No, no, no. Not like this. Like this. Just the two lips. That's okay. A little bit lower down is fine.
[1517.78s -> 1522.87s]  That's right. It's just a fish. I feel like I didn't touch anything but I feel like they're
[1522.87s -> 1526.23s]  having trouble standing. Are they like swaying and moving weirdly to anybody else? I feel like
[1526.23s -> 1540.12s]  they're having trouble here. I didn't have- were they doing this the whole time? I don't think so.
[1540.12s -> 1547.27s]  Okay, that's fine. Oh wait, they're not supposed to have teeth. This is the- I don't have teeth
[1547.27s -> 1557.94s]  mouth but they're showing teeth. That doesn't make any sense anymore. Hey! Over the other way.
[1558.58s -> 1570.98s]  Oh no. This is slowly becoming a sus image, isn't it? No, it's got to be like that. Pissed.
[1570.98s -> 1588.25s]  With a big underbite. All right, this is fucked up because I feel like this person, if they- if
[1588.25s -> 1592.79s]  like their boogers just go right into their mouth, that's fucked up. If this person's asleep on the
[1592.79s -> 1596.71s]  train and they have a runny nose, they're just pooling the runny nose directly into their mouth.
[1604.66s -> 1609.78s]  Okay, I think that's fine. Is that- maybe not that extreme? Maybe. That's too extreme, you think?
[1612.60s -> 1624.31s]  That's fine. Like that. Oh, I don't want to look at that for the next like six hours. No, like this.
[1624.31s -> 1638.30s]  I don't hate that. This is hard to look at. Yeah, I- that's why I don't want it to be that extreme
[1638.30s -> 1653.00s]  because we have to look at this for a long time. We have to look at this for a while. Double chin?
[1653.00s -> 1667.46s]  There- I mean, there is no double chin. There's one single bullfrog chin. It's not double. We've-
[1667.46s -> 1679.90s]  we're past the point where there's a double. All right, almost done. Should we just make
[1679.90s -> 1697.93s]  him a beanbag chair? I don't know. Jaw height? Oh, he can pull it up. Yeah, but his- his head,
[1697.93s -> 1707.30s]  his chin is going into his body. Leave the poor- leave this poor man alone. Is that too much?
[1707.30s -> 1717.35s]  Because it's- I don't know. I feel like that's too much. We made Patrick Star
[1722.33s -> 1746.25s]  unavailable. All right, hold on. What about the hair? Wait, hold on. Oh no. It can't be Patrick Star
[1746.25s -> 1750.41s]  though. That's not gonna- it's gonna be- that's funny for right now. You think it's funny right
[1750.41s -> 1756.62s]  now. Let's make him Grimace instead. I like Grimace better than Patrick Star. It's Majin
[1756.62s -> 1763.67s]  Boo. I know, but we all think this is like funny for like the next 10 minutes. After- after he's
[1763.67s -> 1767.27s]  purple Grimace for four hours, I don't- I don't think we're gonna think it's funny anymore. It's
[1767.27s -> 1784.47s]  like a one- it's a one minute joke. It's funny right now. Like Mr. Greens? No, they can't keep
[1784.47s -> 1790.62s]  Grimace. Oh, okay. Fine. I'll keep it as Grimace. I like Grimace the most out of all of these.
[1790.62s -> 1799.91s]  But he- I- it's gonna be so distracting. If it's Grimace, he has to lose the hair. Hold on. I am
[1799.91s -> 1838.22s]  not committing yet. Facial hair? No. Okay, here we go. First Lady? That's just on- on this guy.
[1838.22s -> 1860.06s]  It's Elvis. I don't think. Half of these just look like coral reefs on him. They're so all- look at
[1860.06s -> 1872.47s]  this. This looks like a coral reef. This doesn't even look like hair. This looks like underwater
[1873.03s -> 1886.28s]  sea creature. Okay, if- like if- okay, if I showed you this image right here, and I told you- and I
[1886.28s -> 1891.85s]  asked you, what is this? What is this image? I don't- what would you say? You'd probably say
[1891.85s -> 1916.62s]  some deep sea thing. Okay, I think we found it. This is a sea cucumber. This is a cabbage? It
[1916.62s -> 1928.52s]  actually kind of does look like cabbage, you're right. There's so many. This one's good. But if
[1928.52s -> 1935.03s]  we have- if we're gonna commit to Grimace, it can't- Grimace doesn't have hair. I mean, technically
[1935.03s -> 1957.82s]  Grimace is covered in hair. There's so many options. Wait, we- let's go back to the top.
[1957.82s -> 1966.50s]  We started in the middle. He looks like a geode. I mean, this is the easy one if it's Grimace,
[1966.50s -> 1988.01s]  but it can't be. I'm going back. He's not gonna be Grimace. Beehive? Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[1991.62s -> 2002.60s]  I like this one. I like this one. We're keeping this one. None of the facial hair is gonna show
[2002.60s -> 2050.36s]  up. No, no facial hair. Oh, I feel like he's about to start singing the Smash Mouth song. Yeah,
[2050.36s -> 2058.01s]  like, right now. No, no facial hair. Sideburns? I actually like that. Yep. It's Elvis. It's Elvis.
[2058.01s -> 2072.01s]  It's Elvis. It's Elvis. It's Elvis. It's Elvis. I made- I'm done. It's gonna be Elvis. Austin
[2072.01s -> 2087.45s]  Powers? Okay, hold on. Evil scientist. I'll take full. All right, hold on. I need- I gotta get this
[2087.45s -> 2107.34s]  right. Let me see what it looks like when he's not purple Grimace. We'll fix the hair. It's just fat
[2107.34s -> 2115.03s]  bastard from Austin Powers. Fuck, it has to be Grimace now. But that's- no, I can't do just- look,
[2115.03s -> 2132.28s]  he's purple. I don't want it to be purple. No, no. We're going back. I'll get sick of the Grimace
[2132.28s -> 2162.22s]  joke in 20 minutes. I'm gonna fix this. I actually don't hate this. I don't hate this. Wait,
[2162.22s -> 2176.55s]  why does he have, like, a purple fade? Why does he have a- is there purple, like, highlights?
[2176.55s -> 2197.18s]  Oh, it's because the secondary color. No, this doesn't look like- oh my god, this does not-
[2197.18s -> 2203.45s]  somebody said this looks like Adam Driver. What are you talking about? How do you see Adam Driver?
[2203.45s -> 2207.21s]  Adam Driver is like a handsome, like, dashing man. What are you talking about?
[2213.67s -> 2228.46s]  Oh, I don't see it. I don't. I like this though because we're gonna keep it like this. I think
[2228.46s -> 2232.95s]  it's perfect. That's not Adam Driver. It's not at all. I don't even know where you're getting
[2232.95s -> 2237.03s]  that from. I don't know how so many people are- I don't know how many- so many people are agreeing
[2237.03s -> 2260.02s]  with you. So many people are saying Jay Leno, Dan Schneider. No, this is not Gabe Newell, Orson Welles.
[2260.02s -> 2266.82s]  Okay, this is- everyone has- all right, let's keep this for now, I think. I need to keep this.
[2266.82s -> 2272.86s]  All right, I think we're gonna- British accent?
[2280.06s -> 2281.02s]  Keep making British.
[2281.02s -> 2312.38s]  It's Snape. It is Snape. I like Snape the best. Oh, what the fuck?
[2312.38s -> 2343.91s]  Everybody stop talking. All right, we have, like, the soy face. I'm just gonna put this
[2343.91s -> 2349.80s]  on top of me reviewing, like, the new PS5 controller. These are all just thumbnail faces.
[2349.80s -> 2353.61s]  See, what you guys don't know is most YouTubers just sit there in front of their webcam and go
[2353.61s -> 2361.69s]  like this in about maybe two to three minutes, and that's what they've been using on every thumbnail
[2361.69s -> 2367.29s]  for the last five to ten straight fucking years. They've never edited them. They've never updated
[2367.37s -> 2375.50s]  them. Are you re- can I really be, you know, inclined to think that you're, like, very,
[2375.50s -> 2381.13s]  very scared of something? If that's an image that you were scared- is this the same,
[2381.13s -> 2386.62s]  I was scared of this game or this movie or this TV show or this thing, like, seven years ago?
[2386.62s -> 2392.06s]  How do I know that you're scared? You may have been scared when you made this, but not- you're
[2392.06s -> 2402.71s]  just pasting it on everything else. Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's not accurate. They don't have the
[2402.71s -> 2406.87s]  looking up towards the ceiling with your eyes with your finger on your chin thinking about something.
[2406.87s -> 2424.63s]  Isn't that interesting? They forgot that one. I think blank is the best. This is taking shots.
[2424.63s -> 2434.10s]  No, no, I'm not- who- okay, taking shots. I'm the guy that's standing outside screaming. Like,
[2434.10s -> 2436.90s]  okay, you know when you go to, like, a convention where you go to something and there's, like,
[2436.90s -> 2442.34s]  a person that's, like, screaming about God outside? It's just like, what's the- what's the- who's this
[2442.34s -> 2450.95s]  person? Like, I am that person. Everybody else is looking at me like, what the fuck are you talking
[2450.95s -> 2483.32s]  about, dude? Everybody does this shit. Do Dopey, please. Fine. Oh, nice. Okay. Oh, this- I love the-
[2484.44s -> 2499.13s]  this one's really bouncy. This one's very bouncy. What was that? I think we may have found it.
[2499.13s -> 2507.94s]  Not quite, though. Zombie? He looks like a big baby. This is a big baby. I don't like this at all.
[2507.94s -> 2542.50s]  I have to move on now. Oh! Gangsta lean. O2 tank pull? Wasted? Slow and steady. Oh, yeah. Yep. I
[2542.50s -> 2556.18s]  don't need to see anymore. No, I don't have to see any other ones at all. Read the news. Carry books?
[2556.18s -> 2570.07s]  Carry clipboard? Metal detector? Do you actually walk around like this? Out shopping? Keeping dry?
[2570.95s -> 2579.69s]  Or laundry day? Um, I- I think we- it has to be this one. Or this one. No, no. This- I like-
[2580.49s -> 2590.73s]  I'm not gonna- do I move- how do I do this? Okay. No, I like this one. This one's better. You do
[2590.73s -> 2593.93s]  understand that there's so much opportunity for, like, me to make, like, a- like, a laugh-out-loud
[2593.93s -> 2598.04s]  joke where there's, like, a car coming and I do this into the road and get hit? Are you serious?
[2598.04s -> 2611.72s]  You don't think I'm gonna pick this one? This is the easy one. Combat style. There's only one.
[2611.72s -> 2642.25s]  Compliment? Slow kisses? Oh! Guitar? There's no music.
[2643.35s -> 2651.19s]  Photo? Oh, I see, okay.
[2661.56s -> 2662.04s]  This one's probably-
[2665.69s -> 2686.66s]  Okay. Um. Oh, the harmonica. The jig is good too. Okay, I guess we're gonna use the harmonica.
[2687.22s -> 2706.86s]  Yeah, blues is more dynamic. Haunt. Okay, what do we got? Bring the voodoo. Test bump. Come get some.
[2707.66s -> 2718.15s]  Eat takeout. I mean, this one works for this character, but eat the dead? Oh!
[2718.71s -> 2721.98s]  What, I can eat them on the ground?
[2735.66s -> 2737.82s]  I like this one a lot, but I don't- I don't think it fits.
[2745.96s -> 2754.31s]  Sword? Oh! Wait, it doesn't actually wrap?
[2761.42s -> 2767.02s]  Nope. Nope. Wait, that was Harry Potter. That's Voldemort.
[2771.11s -> 2780.94s]  That's a pretty good Voldemort scream. Just smoking? Is that a cigarette? Okay, it's a cigarette.
[2780.94s -> 2799.70s]  How about the wanker? Oh, okay. What the fuck? Oh! Look at the belly button.
[2807.08s -> 2811.32s]  What? It either has to be vomit or- or the fire breather.
[2815.64s -> 2830.63s]  No, I'm not gonna do the default taunt from GTA Online, please. I think we're ready. Okay,
[2830.63s -> 2836.33s]  we did everything right. Let me make sure this is right, okay. Body. I don't think anything else
[2836.33s -> 2846.49s]  needs to happen. All right. Are you guys ready to play the game? I am. Eat takeout. I don't even
[2846.49s -> 2861.18s]  know how to do any of these things. Time to go. Wait. No, okay, no, no. Yeah. Three, two, one, go.
[2861.50s -> 2871.96s]  That looks like it healed nicely. Be careful, doctor. This patient's dangerous. You got anything
[2871.96s -> 2876.12s]  you want to say to the judge? You better start thinking of it now. You're wasting your time.
[2876.12s -> 2885.74s]  Let's get ahold of Troy. Oh my god. Hey, is it really you? This is why I couldn't be Patrick.
[2885.74s -> 2890.14s]  My brother was in the Saints and he told me all about you. Listen, we gotta get you out of here.
[2890.14s -> 2894.62s]  Well, I'm sure if we ask nicely. I know a way out. Yeah? Then why are you still- I feel like
[2894.62s -> 2899.50s]  I'm watching Gumball. Like these two are from different animation styles and different complete
[2900.06s -> 2905.26s]  art styles. You really expect me to trust some guy I don't even know? Come on. I just got myself
[2905.26s -> 2909.26s]  shanked so I could get a chance to talk to you. Doesn't that show I'm loyal? It shows that you're
[2909.26s -> 2913.98s]  dumb enough to let yourself get stabbed. I'm trying to help you. You know what I got the last time I
[2913.98s -> 2921.50s]  trusted someone? Blown the fuck up. You need me. The hell I do. I got the Saints. Sure you do.
[2922.30s -> 2925.98s]  What's that supposed to mean? How long do you think you've been out? I don't know,
[2925.98s -> 2929.74s]  mate. Two to three weeks. Look, I know you think you're a badass, but do you even know where you're
[2929.74s -> 2934.78s]  at? Without me, you'll be wandering around the prison for hours. Even if you manage to hide from
[2934.78s -> 2938.78s]  the guards that long, and if you actually figure out how to make it outside these walls, you're
[2938.78s -> 2942.22s]  just gonna find out that you're sitting on a goddamn- Why does the voice fit him? I'm pretty
[2942.22s -> 2946.78s]  sure- It does. I don't know. It just does. You got a boat stashed here? No, but- I think that's by
[2946.78s -> 2957.43s]  design. All right, let's get out of here. Those little shoes. What? Why am I, um, why am I floating?
[2964.60s -> 2977.46s]  Okay, um, punch and block. Hold will- Okay, that's not correct. Three successful strikes will
[2977.46s -> 2985.08s]  devastate a combo. Alternate- Okay, I need to find out what that is. Okay, that's jump. Okay,
[2985.08s -> 3000.04s]  right trigger is punch. Left trigger is another kind of punch. Wait, what did I just do? I have
[3000.04s -> 3016.12s]  to kill the doctor first. Okay, play the tutorial, sure. Ow. All right, well, what's block? Okay,
[3016.12s -> 3020.44s]  holding- You can hold the button down, but what's block? There was a block. All right, that's like
[3020.44s -> 3030.65s]  my right bumper. E is kick door, but that's not what it is. Okay, it's, it's, uh, why?
[3034.87s -> 3051.66s]  Let's go! Punch, punch, punch! Holy shit. Get her! Get the fuck out of my way! Use R? What was R?
[3052.22s -> 3066.15s]  Oh, the weapon wheel. Okay. All right. I thought the mod, um, gave Xbox 360 controls. Maybe not
[3066.15s -> 3085.93s]  here. I know there's a sprint. What is it? All right, crouch. Okay, it's push in. What's sprint?
[3085.93s -> 3093.70s]  Left bumper? Right bumper? Okay, nice. Thank you. Thank you. This is your mini map. Uh, markers and
[3093.70s -> 3098.87s]  GPS navigation lines here will guide you to objectives. Set GPS waypoints. Okay, this is,
[3098.87s -> 3108.41s]  there's a map. Of course, there's a pause menu, right? Ooh, this is huge. Holy shit. Okay, let's
[3108.41s -> 3125.51s]  go. Kill the guard and take their gun. Is there a sneak? Okay, not really. Did they get the gun?
[3125.51s -> 3129.19s]  Okay, running over weapons you don't have automatically picks them up. Change your weapon,
[3129.19s -> 3139.45s]  press and hold Q. That don't need, that's easy. I already have that. Okay, melee bash or fire gun?
[3139.45s -> 3154.57s]  Okay, good. Good to know. All right, let's go. Oh my god, that was horrible. Was I not supposed to
[3154.57s -> 3166.74s]  do that? Was I not supposed to do that? I don't know. Why would I kick him like in the balls?
[3168.28s -> 3181.90s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Wait, that's a new, that's a new gun. Use R. Don't shoot me. What? Oh,
[3181.90s -> 3202.12s]  wait. Dual wield? Can I? Is it Y? Oh shit. Oh well, it's okay. I'll figure it out. Oh, fuck.
[3204.71s -> 3209.66s]  We just gotta run. We just gotta get out of here. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Does it do, can you do
[3209.66s -> 3217.32s]  weld? I don't think you can do weld. R to do a weld. Yeah, but it's using the, it's not giving
[3217.32s -> 3228.39s]  me controller props. Fine aim is V, which is, I'm assuming it's probably, let's see. Okay, fine aim
[3228.39s -> 3251.74s]  is right on the stick. What the fuck? Why did, why would it explode? I might, okay. All right,
[3251.74s -> 3267.80s]  let's get to the dock. Sprint, yep. Thanks to Chad, I know how to do that. Oh, let's get to the docks.
[3268.44s -> 3283.21s]  How do you drive? Oh, fuck. It's, wait, it's A? It's A and that's, I think I have to change this.
[3284.09s -> 3302.04s]  I have to change this. Get out. I remember this happening. That's how Saint Root, Saint,
[3302.04s -> 3321.50s]  Saint's Row 2 works on console. Oh, fuck. Okay. Defend the boat. From what? Does this thing overheat?
[3325.85s -> 3336.28s]  Helicopter? I got it. Two pistol shots makes it smoke and explode, but I can't take this out
[3336.28s -> 3351.19s]  for the life of me. Oh, wait, I got to reload. Podler aim? It's hard on a controller. Give me a
[3351.19s -> 3372.22s]  break. Where's the music? I turned the music off because people said there was DMCA. Okay,
[3372.22s -> 3378.26s]  that's good. All right. There's nobody, what do you mean don't let them catch us? There's nobody here.
[3382.92s -> 3395.30s]  Oh, it's the helicopter. Okay. Well, I can't. Oh my God. I got it. Just put on Christmas music.
[3395.30s -> 3401.99s]  That's a really actually brilliant idea. Just put on like a royalty-free Christmas music playlist.
[3403.19s -> 3404.63s]  Jesus, when did this happen?
[3416.42s -> 3421.46s]  A very Kevin McLeod Christmas. Ludwig's Christmas album. Oh yeah.
[3430.97s -> 3432.09s]  I keep forgetting it looks like this.
[3444.89s -> 3448.89s]  Cops are looking for you and a lot's changed. I say you just go buy a beer and soak up as
[3448.89s -> 3453.77s]  much information as you can. Thanks Carlos. For a second, I thought he said go grow a beard and like
[3453.77s -> 3458.57s]  lay low. Like I'm not the most distinct looking person in the entire city. I could, guys, I could
[3458.57s -> 3463.02s]  grow a beard. I could wear like eight different like clothes. I could put five hats on. It doesn't
[3463.02s -> 3476.22s]  matter. 500 bucks. Save the game. Yeah. So games, I've heard do not even with the gentleman of the
[3476.22s -> 3494.20s]  row mod that it doesn't matter. Save every time you have an opportunity. Save game. Okay.
[3495.40s -> 3506.47s]  So how do I like, what am I trying to do here? All right. Pick up boxes. This is not like Donkey
[3506.47s -> 3526.22s]  Kong. What am I talking about? Wait, what's in here? Third Street Saints mission. Johnny
[3526.22s -> 3535.51s]  Bravo really let himself go. Okay. I need some new clothes. Why is everybody mad at me? Oh,
[3535.51s -> 3552.22s]  these are police. But wait, I need to get out of here. Wait, I can pick up the trash can. What?
[3552.30s -> 3564.55s]  How do I pick this up? No, fuck. I didn't want to do that. How do I pick it up? What's wrong with me?
[3564.55s -> 3575.22s]  Taunts? Is it, it's B? It's not B. I just took a shotgun out. It's not B. How do I pick up the
[3575.22s -> 3587.53s]  trash can? It's R? It's not. It's not. Don't hit that person. What are you doing? Leave me alone.
[3587.53s -> 3592.10s]  I'm not even trying to hurt you. Get away from me, please. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get
[3592.10s -> 3604.70s]  away from me. Get away from me. Wait, did you just bump? Leave me alone. I'm just hold A? Oh,
[3604.70s -> 3616.12s]  my God. Please leave me alone. They're going to start swarming me. Oh, my God. This lady is
[3616.12s -> 3628.65s]  relentless. I didn't. Okay. Where do I need to go? This way. You're not still following me, right?
[3628.65s -> 3646.79s]  No. All right. Good. Pick up trash can. Somebody said hold A. Okay. It is hold A. Oh, my God. That
[3646.79s -> 3668.57s]  guy. Go buy a lottery ticket. What the fuck? Imagine throwing a trash can at somebody. What
[3668.57s -> 3680.10s]  the fuck is happening right now? Oh, fuck. Okay. I'm going to go. I need a car. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[3680.10s -> 3698.79s]  Oh, shit. I should have done that. Give me that. Get on the bike and go. Go. Get on the bike. What
[3698.79s -> 3704.79s]  is she holding? What is that? Was that a drill? She's got a fucking power drill. Oh, she's drilling
[3704.79s -> 3721.46s]  that. Wait a minute. What? Oh, fuck. I didn't. Who are these people? Get away from me. Okay.
[3721.46s -> 3735.99s]  Hold on. I didn't stop. I have to stop. Wait a minute. Okay. I'm fine. I'm okay. If I let myself
[3735.99s -> 3742.42s]  go too hard there, I'm going to get hurt. I need to slow down. Oh, wait. I'm still holding a gun.
[3742.42s -> 3763.88s]  Put that away. Don't do stupid fucking tricks, you idiot. Just get to the thing. Okay. Buy clothes.
[3765.34s -> 3768.54s]  What? Clothing stores allow you to customize your character. By buying clothes, you can increase
[3768.54s -> 3776.38s]  your style rank. Oh, it's because I have a gun out. Okay. Purchase some clothes. We can get hats.
[3780.63s -> 3785.96s]  None of these are going to look right at all. This really is a bicycle seat.
[3785.96s -> 3802.17s]  Should I get the bicycle seat? I'm going to get this. No, no. Hold on. You can do different styles?
[3802.17s -> 3820.66s]  Arts. It's the Joker. Make him the Joker? Are those cops after me? I hear sirens. It's a shower cap.
[3820.66s -> 3839.96s]  Yeah, I don't want this. Actually, I'd rather have this. Okay. Oh, goodness. How much is this?
[3840.28s -> 3860.87s]  Okay. How about the... Keep the basic tee on for now. The tank top. Are you sure you don't want me
[3860.87s -> 3879.38s]  to have the bathing suit? The onesie bathing suit? Okay. What about... I don't want anything
[3879.38s -> 3893.74s]  underneath because I want it to be a bathing suit. Is there none? I guess I could do the jean shorts.
[3893.74s -> 3899.06s]  I have to be honest. There's no way that foot's coming out of that shoe ever again. Those
[3899.06s -> 3913.19s]  essentially have been surgically put on. They're not coming out. Roller skates? No way. Can I roller
[3913.27s -> 3933.10s]  skate around? Keep in the socks. Definitely. I want these. I just want tighty-whities on.
[3940.78s -> 3959.48s]  Okay. That was good. Should I have arm pads? No, no. Outfits? No. Okay. What else? Viscillaneous one?
[3959.48s -> 3974.57s]  No. A tool belt? Yes. Look at that hammer. Absolutely. I want the tool belt. I'm ready.
[3974.57s -> 3983.45s]  Okay. Switch to wardrobe. How do I switch to wardrobe? What space? No. What did I just buy?
[3983.45s -> 3992.28s]  Did I just buy the tool belt twice? What happened? No. What? Space is space. Okay. Well,
[3992.28s -> 4020.60s]  whatever. Why can I do that? Can I take the cash? Is there money in here? Oh my god. That lady. Is
[4020.60s -> 4025.64s]  there money in here? How do I get the money out? Why can I leave? Am I too big to leave the store?
[4025.64s -> 4048.86s]  How do I get? How do I? I want the money in this thing. Is there money? I already got it. Oh,
[4048.86s -> 4080.34s]  I got it. I got it. Yeah, I am in roller skates, but I'm not skating. Oh, damn it. That was so
[4080.34s -> 4084.92s]  close to hitting that guy in the head with trash. Save, save, save, save, save, save, save, save.
[4084.92s -> 4119.48s]  I need a car. Wrong button. I wish I could skate around. All right. What's reverse? Give me a break.
[4119.48s -> 4141.02s]  What the fuck? No. Get. Get. Leave me alone. Please. I thought that I just got struck by
[4141.02s -> 4156.50s]  lightning. I thought that was lightning that just hit right there. Leave me alone. You stole his car.
[4157.14s -> 4168.70s]  Is there a handbrake? What's the handbrake? Christmas music. All right. All right. All
[4168.70s -> 4177.50s]  on. All to having is going to be a disaster. I got to be careful. Let me save it right here.
[4177.50s -> 4201.13s]  Don't forget about Christmas music. I know I'm getting it. I hope it doesn't crash.
[4201.13s -> 4216.60s]  Will crash. It might. We'll find out. All right. Chris. Should I put on Ludwig's music? How many
[4216.60s -> 4236.01s]  songs did he do? Oh shit. He's got like a shitload of songs. No music. I'm putting it on. It's going
[4236.01s -> 4253.02s]  to be just low in the background. Pretty relaxed. Okay. Did it crash? I could do my own rendition
[4253.02s -> 4274.94s]  too, if you want. You can't even hear the music. It's drawn up by fucking rain. Hold on. This.
[4282.20s -> 4292.50s]  It actually works really well. I think this Christmas sucks. It's scary out here.
[4308.44s -> 4311.00s]  I have to pause it for this. I have to pause it.
[4319.70s -> 4329.38s]  Okay. I can't turn it off. I can't alt tab. Hey, Barry, turn this shit off. I can't.
[4353.27s -> 4354.63s]  Christmas is ruined.
[4364.02s -> 4376.14s]  Wait, what? Who's that? Oh, I don't know who that was. Why did I just do that?
[4382.82s -> 4387.62s]  No, how do I have to fight? Why are these people here? Is somebody up on the roof?
[4387.62s -> 4395.03s]  Where is this person? I don't know where this person is. I missed that whole cut scene. I was
[4395.03s -> 4407.32s]  laughing at the Christmas music. How do I get out of here? How do I get out of here?
[4408.28s -> 4414.18s]  Do I have to fight these people? They're on the mini-map. Are you on the mini-map?
[4414.82s -> 4419.62s]  I don't know. Are you on the mini-map? I think she's on the mini-map. Are you on the mini-map?
[4422.62s -> 4444.14s]  Are these people on the mini-map? I gotta get out of here. Let's get out of here. Who is this?
[4448.62s -> 4457.51s]  What are you doing? What are you gonna spray with? Pepper spray? A spray can? I don't even...
[4458.76s -> 4462.33s]  Just wait. Hold on. I don't want to shoot you, but I'm gonna...
[4464.49s -> 4469.53s]  All right. You're fucking dead, buddy. I'm sick of this shit. Get the fuck out of here. Get out of
[4469.53s -> 4492.78s]  here. Get off. Get off. I'm getting lightheaded now. Okay. Let's go to the... We only have three
[4492.78s -> 4525.11s]  minutes? What? The court. I gotta get to the courthouse. Who's behind me? Give me this car.
[4525.11s -> 4563.21s]  I gotta get to the courthouse in three minutes. Go. All right. This is good. Can we just take a
[4563.21s -> 4574.25s]  second to understand? This is good music. They did a fucking fantastic job. All right. Go.
[4574.73s -> 4586.68s]  I'm at the court. What am I doing here? Why am I here? Find the courtroom? What?
[4590.20s -> 4592.92s]  I don't know where this person is. I wasn't even listening. I wasn't paying any attention.
[4593.48s -> 4608.49s]  What room are they in? Which door is it? Oh, I need a break.
[4608.97s -> 4625.34s]  It's the most wonderful time of the year. With the kids jingle belling and everyone telling
[4625.34s -> 4634.06s]  you be of good cheer. What am I doing here? Mr. Gatt, you've been convicted of over 300 murders.
[4634.06s -> 4637.82s]  Do you really expect this appeal to work? I figured with the statute of limitations,
[4637.82s -> 4642.30s]  it really should be closer to two feet. There's no statute of limitations for murder.
[4643.18s -> 4652.46s]  Oh, fuck. Hold on. I gotta pause it. Jesus. I need a break. My fucking head's gonna explode.
[4667.91s -> 4676.20s]  Fuck just happened. Who is this? Is that me? What am I doing here?
[4677.83s -> 4709.18s]  Oh, I'm breaking him out. All right. Let's go. So I'm breaking out this criminal.
[4709.98s -> 4718.31s]  How do we leave? No, I'm gonna put the music back on. I promise. I need a break. My whole
[4718.31s -> 4733.74s]  fucking body hurts. Let's just fucking run. Who cares? I can't jump over that. Go, go,
[4733.74s -> 4746.54s]  go, go, go, go. Was this the judge? What the judge? It's a shotgun. All right. Get a soda.
[4746.54s -> 4765.42s]  Can I buy a soda? All right. Ready? Go. Oh my God. You guys cannot hit anything.
[4765.98s -> 4785.48s]  Fucking storm troopers. Oh, fuck. Don't talk shit. Hold on. Okay. Go. Go. Oh my God. Get us out. Get
[4785.48s -> 4792.79s]  us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Okay. That really just worked.
[4792.79s -> 4811.67s]  Yeah, it did. Oh, wait. No. No, no, no, no. I thought you were the guy. Where's the guy?
[4812.63s -> 4823.75s]  Where's the guy? Oh shit. Oh no. He's fucked. Oh no.
[4829.13s -> 4832.09s]  Get out of the way, please. How do I revive him?
[4832.81s -> 4846.12s]  Oh shit. Where am I? No. Damn it. Fuck. I thought he was going to get in the car.
[4846.12s -> 4859.59s]  I thought he was going to get in the car. Oh no. Did I crash? All right. All right. I got to focus.
[4867.38s -> 4885.06s]  Get away. Hold on. I just want to stop doing like modal combat moves. What do you mean abandon?
[4885.06s -> 4893.96s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Where are you? What are you doing? What are you doing?
[4906.34s -> 4914.55s]  Okay. All right. Get up. All right. I got to remember what E is. Okay. E is triangle.
[4914.55s -> 4929.64s]  You good? Let's move. I didn't know he was going to get stuck back there.
[4930.44s -> 4947.53s]  Just run. Just run. Just run. Run. Run. Just run through. Run. Let's go. I'm not messing with
[4947.53s -> 4964.34s]  the judge with the shotgun. It's not going to happen. All right. Don't get stuck in the door
[4964.34s -> 4977.83s]  this time. I'm dual welding? I'm not. I am not dual welding. Okay. Here we go. Leave.
[4978.47s -> 4987.61s]  Somebody just said pacifist run. What? What? I just like I've killed like fifth. What are you
[4987.61s -> 4997.99s]  talking about? Let's go. Get out. Get in.
[5007.19s -> 5008.47s]  Troop behind us. Somebody behind us.
[5020.55s -> 5028.47s]  How do I shoot the gun? Wait till they get out. That's the strategy. Wait till they get out of
[5028.47s -> 5044.55s]  the car. That was uncalled for. Why did he do that? That was not what I did it for.
[5054.10s -> 5057.32s]  Forgive and forget allows you to remove all notoriety for a price.
[5060.04s -> 5073.43s]  I'm in a cop car. I'm still a cop car. Put the music back on. All right. Hold on.
[5076.09s -> 5101.61s]  What happened? Holy shit. What the fuck is going on here? Oh no. Oh no. Have you noticed that my
[5101.61s -> 5107.48s]  voice has been like, I don't know, I've turned into like an old library, like an old librarian
[5108.12s -> 5116.70s]  when I laugh. It's like, oh no. Oh my goodness. When did I become the librarian in the cinnamon
[5116.70s -> 5121.82s]  toast crunch commercial that gets mad at how loud the crunching is? I may have just made that
[5121.82s -> 5129.51s]  commercial, but I don't think I did. So that's a commercial, right? That's like, it's so crunchy.
[5130.15s -> 5157.54s]  Why did we do? What was that for? All right. You're good. 500 bucks. Oh, I have a red light
[5157.54s -> 5166.09s]  apartment crib now. Cool. This is your respect meter. Respect this game by completing activities
[5166.09s -> 5173.62s]  and diversions. Once you have enough respect, you can play missions. Oh, okay. It's like experience.
[5173.62s -> 5181.37s]  All right. Go to the previous map to view activity locations. Okay. You can set a waypoint
[5181.37s -> 5189.64s]  on the map. Okay. Very cool. Set a waypoint for an activity now. All right. So these are
[5189.64s -> 5199.30s]  just activities, vehicle dealer, unknown activity. Well, I feel like it has to be in this zone here,
[5199.30s -> 5219.82s]  right? It doesn't matter. All right. We're going to go here. Activity. This is my truck. It's not
[5219.82s -> 5232.09s]  your truck. Okay. Well, this is probably my bike. She's sitting on this. You're going to get on,
[5232.65s -> 5252.34s]  but she acts like she's going to get on. Okay. Save. Yep. All right. Let's get that music back
[5252.34s -> 5281.98s]  on. You thought I was going to run them all over, didn't you? Nope. All the rules. We're
[5281.98s -> 5309.37s]  listening to Christmas music. Oh, fuck the rules. Who cares? What's on that truck? Whoa.
[5323.90s -> 5339.29s]  I had to hold that to the end of the song. You know I did. Fuzz.
[5350.30s -> 5368.84s]  Don't turn it off. I'm keeping it on.
[5368.84s -> 5381.16s]  It's too loud. There. No, it's not.
[5390.78s -> 5394.30s]  Let's go wait. Impersonate one of Stillwater's finest and provide quality footage of the Fuzz
[5394.30s -> 5409.51s]  crew for cash and respect. Oh, shit. Wait, they have to catch the streaker? That's the
[5409.51s -> 5416.87s]  streaker right there. That's the streaker right there. What? We just killed him. That person's
[5416.87s -> 5423.54s]  streaking right now. Wait, are there more than one streaker? Why is it more than one person? What?
[5423.54s -> 5444.78s]  What? Oh, wait. That person. How is that person not naked? I need more footage. Why do we need
[5444.78s -> 5452.38s]  more footage? Get away from me. I'm trying to film something. I don't have enough footage.
[5453.67s -> 5457.51s]  How is this not footage? It's just zoomed in like. Wait, why is there a cop in the car?
[5458.39s -> 5463.67s]  Why did they get in the car?
[5466.44s -> 5471.56s]  Fucking turn the record button on. Turn the record button on. What are you doing?
[5479.59s -> 5492.18s]  Oh, apprehend. How do I apprehend him? What do you grab him? All right, get him. Don't kill him.
[5492.18s -> 5506.46s]  Apprehend him. What are you doing? What? How do we apprehend him? He's. What?
[5518.58s -> 5535.34s]  I get it. There's more. OK, there's more than one. Stop the lewd pedestrians.
[5536.06s -> 5544.76s]  I'll get it. I get it. I still have a minute. I first came out the window.
[5547.98s -> 5560.79s]  Have they been stopped? I don't understand what stops them. Don't run away. Get out of the way.
[5565.27s -> 5572.49s]  OK, wait, he already has enough camera footage of you running over perps.
[5573.45s -> 5578.39s]  Oh, god damn it. Really? I feel like that's what you guys say.
[5579.11s -> 5584.42s]  A chat sick of you like running people over and falling off ledges. Do something else, streamer.
[5598.49s -> 5619.40s]  Squid Game. Hit him. We did it. Don't give me a minus two for that. You all fucking love that show.
[5628.28s -> 5642.86s]  Oh, it's more level two. Oh, god. Do I have to do it again? I don't know. This is just an activity.
[5642.86s -> 5657.16s]  OK, I'll try it one more time. That's in the script. You can quit at any time. Yeah, I'll do
[5657.16s -> 5673.93s]  one more. How do I fly off the top of the screen? I don't know what that was. Was that him? Holy shit.
[5685.32s -> 5700.70s]  Oh, my god. Get out of my way. Oh, my please. I'm done. I'm not doing this anymore.
[5701.26s -> 5710.98s]  Activities. Turn it off. What is this? No. Turn it off. Activities. Can I turn it off?
[5714.14s -> 5727.88s]  Oh, down on the D-pad. Cool. OK, that's cool. No, don't. I just hit retry. Oh, my god. No,
[5727.88s -> 5732.73s]  get out of here. I wanted to exit it and not be like, oh, retry. Press A.
[5733.37s -> 5742.97s]  Meet me at Aisha's place. We got to figure out our next move.
[5742.97s -> 5771.82s]  What do I do? Where's the walker? There it is. Boomer. All right, the album's almost over,
[5771.82s -> 5804.52s]  so I got to make the best use of it. Come on. What the fuck?
[5804.68s -> 5813.74s]  I don't care about the presents under Christmas tree. I don't need to hang my stockings
[5813.74s -> 5822.50s]  Fuck you. Santa Claus won't make me happy. The toy on Christmas day.
[5822.50s -> 5839.16s]  Fuck all of you. Hit me already. Whatever. In the crosswalk. I'll turn it off. Ow, my eyes.
[5840.36s -> 5842.04s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Perfect.
[5842.20s -> 5848.46s]  As for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow.
[5849.50s -> 5858.71s]  I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe. I will make a list and send it
[5858.71s -> 5867.24s]  to the North Pole for Saint Nick. I will stay awake to hear those magic reindeer
[5867.24s -> 5887.82s]  Because I just want you here tonight, holding so tight. No! Christmas is over.
[5887.82s -> 5892.30s]  What the fuck? All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere.
[5892.30s -> 5906.57s]  The sound of children's laughter fills the air. Those sleigh bells ringing.
[5907.53s -> 5908.01s]  No!
[5924.58s -> 5934.28s]  It's not gonna happen. I'm trying to scare people. Oh, whatever. I'm done. We'll just go.
[5938.10s -> 5943.50s]  Just do it on the highway instead. Yeah, I know. Good idea. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5954.84s -> 5958.28s]  Oh my god, fucking hit me already. You're ruining the whole joke.
[5975.02s -> 5991.69s]  Oh my god, dude, please. Wait, this one's not royalty-free.
[5992.41s -> 6005.83s]  What's this over here? What is that? This is a doctor's office?
[6010.18s -> 6029.99s]  Uh, what are you talking about? Can I buy stuff? You thought Ludwig's album was...
[6031.03s -> 6035.51s]  Holy goodness. Okay, let me try that again. Three, two, one.
[6036.55s -> 6039.83s]  You thought Ludwig's album was royalty-free? Omega-lul.
[6039.83s -> 6055.90s]  I want that. The person has a sword. I want it. Wait, I can't take the sword?
[6056.54s -> 6080.34s]  Oh, this is a costume. Hey, how do you pull the camera back when you're in the car?
[6080.34s -> 6087.69s]  I know this is the way to do it, right? Select? I want to go get a hamburger.
[6087.69s -> 6099.75s]  It's B? It's not B. Humper? It's not Y. Y's jump out.
[6100.39s -> 6115.54s]  Cruise control? Let's look behind. It's V. Not V. L3? Yeah. R2 and Y?
[6120.26s -> 6126.89s]  What the fuck? What the hell's going on? Is this a gang?
[6132.55s -> 6142.14s]  How would you ever bring a knife to a gunfight? Oh, hell yeah. Oh shit.
[6144.58s -> 6150.66s]  Oh my god, what happened? What just happened? Um, how do I pick up weapons? R? What's R on the...
[6151.54s -> 6162.60s]  I don't remember. R. I don't think I ever figured that out. Hold A. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[6162.68s -> 6171.51s]  All right, just give me one of your motorcycles.
[6180.23s -> 6197.54s]  I'm just trying to go get a hamburger for god's sakes. Please don't. What? Are you kidding me?
[6197.54s -> 6219.48s]  Why can I do this? Enable the controller buttons in the settings? Is that in the options? Gamepad
[6219.48s -> 6228.25s]  controls? I think that's a mod thing. It should be enabled. I don't know why it's not enabled.
[6228.25s -> 6244.63s]  Graphics quality? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I don't think it's here. It should be just part of the mod.
[6244.63s -> 6250.55s]  Enable display. It's not in display. It's in audio. All right.
[6250.55s -> 6255.21s]  Yeah, it's in the mod configuration. I thought it was already there. It's okay. I'll be fine.
[6255.21s -> 6292.33s]  Fucking idiot. Save game. Yep. There it is. Can I not go in? Will you people leave me alone?
[6292.33s -> 6311.00s]  Leave me the fuck alone! Get out of here! I'm just trying to get food. What is that car?
[6311.00s -> 6319.40s]  It's like a transformer. It's too late? Oh, what time? Okay, what time is it?
[6322.65s -> 6342.42s]  Uh, this guy is still in the car. Why are they on my ass so bad? I want to get a hamburger.
[6342.42s -> 6365.45s]  Is there a drive-through? Look at the minimap. Oh, drive-through. It's a mission marker? Oh my
[6365.45s -> 6382.30s]  God. Hold on. I'm not ready yet. I'm just looking at your menu. You guys served breakfast this late?
[6395.40s -> 6417.19s]  Oh shit! Why are people swarming me? Leave me alone. Oh, what's this? This game is really fun.
[6417.19s -> 6427.37s]  It's very fun. There's too much to do. Okay, let's do a race. Three, two, one.
[6428.41s -> 6435.88s]  Oh, this is not accurate. Everybody crashes into each other in the first one second and only one
[6435.88s -> 6446.74s]  person's left doing the race. Oh, yeah. Are you fucking kidding me? I didn't know you had to
[6446.74s -> 6467.54s]  touch it. I'll make it up. I'll make the time up. Don't worry. Just what? What's handbrake on
[6467.54s -> 6478.90s]  controller? Somebody tell me. What is it? Is it Y? It's not Y. It's not B either. Is it B?
[6479.62s -> 6488.18s]  It's not B. You fucking liars. What is it? R1? I told you I could make the time up. It's not R1
[6488.18s -> 6510.66s]  either. I just turned on cruise control. Okay, left trigger. Thank you. Where's the person in
[6510.66s -> 6522.97s]  first place? Come on. There they are. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Crash into somebody.
[6522.97s -> 6536.82s]  Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash. Come on. Hit something. Hit anything. Hit somebody.
[6541.10s -> 6549.67s]  I had this too. Y is boost. Oh, really? That's pretty cool. Nice. Y is boost. That's cool.
[6550.55s -> 6558.57s]  That's a silver. I got the silver. Whatever. All right. Let's actually do a mission now.
[6558.57s -> 6569.46s]  What's this? There's a store. Oh, no. I want to see the store. That's pretty sick. I jumped over.
[6574.86s -> 6588.84s]  What store is it? What? Well, I got a bike. Oh, it's the doctor. Take that limo. No, I don't want
[6588.84s -> 6600.79s]  it. Can I fly with this? Does it push me up? No. Oh, well. All right. It's time to do a mission.
[6600.79s -> 6613.03s]  I've been doing nothing for like an hour and a half. No. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Mission. Go.
[6613.03s -> 6637.16s]  I look like I'm asleep. I look like I was asleep. What the fuck is happening? What? Why is it on
[6637.16s -> 6661.05s]  fire? Oh, my fucking God. Let's go. How come this isn't on my minimap right now? Waypoint. There we
[6661.05s -> 6689.11s]  go. Quick before it explodes. Quick before it explodes. Map can be buggy in this game. Heads up.
[6689.11s -> 6703.58s]  Okay. Good to know. I just dove. He wasn't even paying attention either. Can I go in the restaurant
[6703.58s -> 6712.41s]  during operating hours? I need to find out. I'm very curious. Can I actually go in here or is it
[6712.41s -> 6729.08s]  only a drive-through? Oh, well. It's only drive-through. Oh, your voice makes my balls
[6729.08s -> 6734.60s]  ache. I don't I that could be I don't know what that even means. That could go in a bunch of
[6734.60s -> 6747.50s]  directions. What is that? Is that like liquor? What's this? Alcohol or something? Like drinks?
[6748.06s -> 6769.51s]  What is this? It's a pet store? Liquor store? Where's the entrance? When he said, yo, where's
[6769.51s -> 6780.66s]  the music? Can't do music. Wait, can I buy a car? Purchase more expensive vehicles at vehicle
[6780.66s -> 6809.83s]  dealerships. What a weird way to get off the bike. Oh, oh, come on. 15,000. Oh, compensator. Cool. Can
[6809.83s -> 6833.27s]  I hit this guy with the car? 70,000. I think there's extra cars in the mod. Are these extra?
[6833.27s -> 6852.06s]  The mod apparently adds a bunch of cards. Very cool. That's cool. What mod is this? This is
[6852.06s -> 6865.21s]  gentleman of the row. That's at a different shop. You just call me scrub? No, not worth it. What?
[6865.21s -> 6901.74s]  Let's do it. I'm like a melted action figure. You want a beer? Yeah, that'd be great. Juggles
[6901.74s -> 6916.31s]  the great. Yo, come to the living room. Don't do that. A bottle opener is like $1.50. You're
[6916.31s -> 6919.83s]  going to get hurt. You're going to break it. It's going to cut you. Don't do that. Don't be an idiot.
[6919.83s -> 6924.33s]  Or that you're talking. You're going to fuck up your table. We all thought you were dead.
[6924.33s -> 6929.93s]  I almost was. Well, for someone who was blown to hell, you look great. Did you do something
[6929.93s -> 6933.53s]  with your hair? Yeah, I've been getting that a lot. Yo, can we give it back to business?
[6934.25s -> 6938.49s]  What's the rush? I've been cooped up on death row and that bitch has been laid out in a coma.
[6939.45s -> 6944.49s]  We definitely need to remind motherfuckers who we are. And that can't wait until after dinner?
[6944.57s -> 6950.57s]  No. You two haven't changed at all. Well, you know, there's a saying about dogs and blowing shit up.
[6951.61s -> 6957.91s]  So what's the plan? We get our crew together. Once we got that, we can work on our taking back our
[6957.91s -> 6967.78s]  city. Sounds good. And where were you planning on having this little meeting? Right here. No.
[6967.78s -> 6973.22s]  Well, this place is pretty spacious. No. The color is very soothing. No. Come on,
[6973.70s -> 6981.13s]  this ain't no fucking gang clubhouse. Change of plans. We got to find a new place. Yeah.
[6981.13s -> 6987.88s]  He sounds like the Geico gecko. See what we do here is what I talk about. It's a commercial.
[6987.88s -> 6992.44s]  It's not a commercial though. I'm a real person. I'm treated like a real guy. Geico. I'm a real guy.
[6992.44s -> 6997.66s]  I'm not a fucking fake lizard. Did you know that I was me that came up with the idea?
[6998.78s -> 7003.50s]  Geico said 15% of all car insurance. I was me a lizard. I'm not real. Even though they treat me
[7003.50s -> 7007.50s]  like I'm a real person talking to a camera. Like it's like the ad people are there in the room
[7007.50s -> 7010.54s]  and the cameraman and shit. We got to find a new place. Stop making those.
[7011.50s -> 7016.14s]  Stop making those. We don't like them. And we're not staying in the mission.
[7016.14s -> 7020.70s]  Now check it out. Years ago, an earthquake dropped part of the city below sea level.
[7020.70s -> 7025.66s]  And rather than clearing out the rubble, the city just built over. There's an abandoned hotel below
[7025.66s -> 7030.70s]  the mission that'll work for us. All right. What's the catch? We got to evict the current tenants.
[7030.78s -> 7040.97s]  Sounds like fun. Make more. You're talking about them right now. Yeah, but advertising worked on
[7040.97s -> 7047.96s]  you. No, it didn't. I'm completely immune to advertising. See, I'm one of those people that
[7047.96s -> 7063.06s]  says no ads work on me, which usually means all ads work on me. And I can tell you that ads work
[7063.86s -> 7066.82s]  because the amount of times that I've seen stuffed crust pizza ads in my life,
[7067.54s -> 7072.30s]  when I was preparing stuffing for Thanksgiving, I wanted a stuffed crust pizza because the word
[7072.30s -> 7091.69s]  stuff. They fucked me up for life. For life. Why are you not eating stuffed crust right now?
[7092.73s -> 7109.08s]  That's a really good question. But hold on a second. He's okay. He's all right.
[7112.90s -> 7127.11s]  We can swim. We're fine. We made it. We don't have a car anymore, but we'll get there.
[7130.01s -> 7133.29s]  It was like a coin pusher game. They were right on the edge. I had to push them.
[7150.01s -> 7162.15s]  No. All right. I'm fine. Don't you think you wouldn't be wanting to walk over here?
[7173.32s -> 7176.28s]  All of you thought it was going to happen again. And I made sure that it wouldn't.
[7180.57s -> 7184.74s]  I made damn sure that it was not going to happen again. But I'll tell you right now,
[7184.74s -> 7194.66s]  I want this person's car because it's way better. Easy. Easy. No, they got away. What happened?
[7194.66s -> 7217.96s]  Okay, here we go. Let's do it. Make your way underground. Do I have enough weapons for this?
[7221.08s -> 7244.10s]  Ooh. I'm sorry. I had to do it. I haven't done it in a while. To go underground.
[7244.10s -> 7268.92s]  Resident Evil 4 graphics. That's a great game too. Let's flashbang the room first.
[7268.92s -> 7298.90s]  That didn't work. Never mind. Where is he? Down there? Hey, what the fuck?
[7306.78s -> 7309.50s]  Watch out. Don't run in my line of fire. What are you out of your mind?
[7317.64s -> 7330.89s]  How much ammo do I have? You all right? We didn't even get hurt. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
[7330.89s -> 7334.09s]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all right? You okay? You okay? You okay? Get up. Get up. Get
[7334.09s -> 7353.78s]  up. Tagging? Oh, shit. Nice. Let's go. This is kind of hard with a controller. Shake the spray can?
[7361.51s -> 7397.13s]  You got this? Can you handle it? Oh, my God. What just happened? Gun. Nice. Okay. What? Oh,
[7397.13s -> 7403.03s]  it's a shotgun now. Wait. No, I want the other gun. Oh, fuck it. I'll use the shotgun. Who cares?
[7403.03s -> 7412.31s]  This is my weapon of choice anyways. I'll show you why. Just wait. I'll show you why in a minute.
[7412.95s -> 7423.16s]  What are these people? Oh. What was going on? Why did they all get out of there? What was that?
[7425.08s -> 7429.24s]  What's going on? Who are these people? They're not bad? I don't know. I saw them get up on
[7429.24s -> 7439.26s]  the grass and start running at me. I didn't know. I did not know. I'm sorry. You want to handle this
[7439.26s -> 7455.77s]  one? You take care of this one. You get it. I'll get it. You idiot. Oh, my God. Fuck off with this
[7455.77s -> 7474.89s]  bullshit. Got him. One more up here. All right. We did it. Destroy the shanties.
[7477.03s -> 7501.99s]  We get out of here? What do we have to do? Whoa. Use left control to take someone's human shield
[7501.99s -> 7506.78s]  to prevent you from getting hit by Moe's bullets. What? I don't know what that button is. I have no
[7506.78s -> 7518.71s]  idea what that button is. My God. How do I do that? Dude. That's no way to act. I'm going to
[7518.71s -> 7524.30s]  have to tell you right now. That's no way to act. That's no way to act. I'm sorry. It's not.
[7524.30s -> 7553.03s]  Why won't this break? That's no way to act. But how do I do this? Throw someone at it. Okay. I have
[7553.03s -> 7557.51s]  to figure out what that button that is. Come here. I'm going to test some stuff on you for a second.
[7557.51s -> 7569.08s]  It's not... Wait. You're not actually mad, right? Right bumper? Why? What is control? Left bumper?
[7570.74s -> 7577.69s]  Okay. It's left bumper. So hold on. Don't shoot this person. Don't shoot this person. Stop.
[7577.69s -> 7585.59s]  Do not. Oh my goodness gracious. Okay. Don't shoot that person. I'm going to fucking be pissed if you
[7585.59s -> 7604.66s]  do. Oops. I can't believe you can... It's not like... This is not... We're not playing. Okay.
[7604.66s -> 7616.68s]  I have to hold them. Why can't I just kick these? I don't... I can't. I just want to punch them down.
[7616.68s -> 7622.58s]  I don't want to throw people into them. You don't stop doing that or I'm actually going to hurt you.
[7623.22s -> 7643.56s]  I'll hurt you motherfucker. I will. Don't do that. I've seen too much. What happened? I put the
[7643.56s -> 7666.63s]  fucking gun down. Now. Why are we doing this? Is this like another gang? Holy shit. They have
[7666.63s -> 7682.41s]  fucking weapons. Hold on. I'm stun locked. Okay. Go. You are gangsters. They're in your hideout.
[7694.47s -> 7698.38s]  Oh, you get the safe house. Okay. I see. He studied the blade.
[7705.32s -> 7726.06s]  Star Wars kid. I forgot I had the skates on. Okay. Thousand bucks. I get five hundred bucks a day.
[7726.86s -> 7741.19s]  Oh, that's cool. Wait. I get to have my own gang? Oh shit. Okay. Seventeen hundred bucks.
[7741.83s -> 7752.65s]  Sorry. Let me go in here. Okay. All right. Fill up your respect bar to play this mission. Oh, I can't.
[7755.02s -> 7762.97s]  Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. This is a Nickelodeon Nicktoons MLB mod.
[7765.62s -> 7773.42s]  More extreme that you do things a better more respect. Okay. All right. So let's do an activity.
[7773.42s -> 7776.90s]  This one's the closest. We're going to do this one. Save the game. Yep.
[7779.53s -> 7789.75s]  Two percent of the game done. It's not actually right here, right? Oh, this is your garage.
[7790.87s -> 7821.90s]  Oh, okay. Oh, tagging mission. Walker comes up. What's that meter on the left?
[7822.46s -> 7836.47s]  It's like the boss health meter. What does that mean? Is that my health? That's enemy attention.
[7837.19s -> 7843.27s]  Oh, I. Oh, that would make sense then as to why they're coming over here now to kill me. Help me.
[7843.27s -> 7873.50s]  Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Thank you. What was that? I didn't even want to do that.
[7886.14s -> 7902.36s]  Wait. Now all of a sudden she cares. Get me the fuck out of here. Get me out of here.
[7904.52s -> 7926.25s]  Oh, don't get hurt from this. Oh, my God. You idiot. Oh, my God. You idiot twice.
[7926.25s -> 7931.86s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. What is this? What is this mission?
[7931.86s -> 7937.13s]  Thank God you're here. Every second we're talking is one more second of airtime that Zach Johnson
[7937.13s -> 7943.69s]  is stealing from me. Oh, you know, that nut job lawyer who gets hard at the idea of a lawsuit.
[7943.69s -> 7946.89s]  Lately, he's been crusading against media. He deems to be offensive.
[7947.53s -> 7951.69s]  They're gonna be dead when the mission starts. Not really. But the guy makes a big enough ass
[7951.69s -> 7954.81s]  out of himself that whenever he pulls some stunt, people listen.
[7955.37s -> 7960.65s]  And if people are watching him, they're not watching me. So what do you want me to do?
[7961.21s -> 7965.21s]  Get out there and give me something worth covering. The more damage you do,
[7965.21s -> 7967.69s]  the longer I can do a live broadcast.
[7969.05s -> 7978.38s]  The right way. Cause carnage. Okay. Wait. I have to like do a bunch of shit like for you to like
[7978.38s -> 7992.54s]  film it. Okay. I have to give you the fucking content. It doesn't matter what I do. Do I have
[7992.54s -> 7999.62s]  to just break stuff? I have to go to a specific area? Cause that crash game was probably at least
[7999.62s -> 8012.12s]  a hundred bucks. Uh, that was carnage. I mean, that was, I just broke a bunch of stuff. Do 50,000
[8012.12s -> 8035.93s]  property damage. All right. That was so easy. Do it. Get a bonus destroy luxury cards. Wait,
[8035.93s -> 8053.70s]  what about in here? Is it explode? Oh, that was not $50,000 in damage. What are you talking
[8053.78s -> 8083.35s]  about? That was an entire gas station. All right. Cool. Get new missions now, right? I still want
[8083.35s -> 8088.36s]  to figure out what this actually is. I see all these bottles. I need to investigate. What does
[8088.36s -> 8104.79s]  this mean? Okay. So it's a little store. Does that get me in trouble? Oh no. Who let the mayhem guy
[8104.79s -> 8122.17s]  in here? It does get me in trouble. Okay. I do get in trouble. I get in trouble. I didn't even
[8122.17s -> 8131.56s]  touch this guy. I'm trying to pick him up. How do I pick up people? You're a hippo that got into a
[8131.56s -> 8167.91s]  store. I didn't even rob the register. Oh, I can do another mission. Put that on the map. I can
[8167.91s -> 8176.57s]  go here or I can go down here. What's this stronghold mission? Uh, this one's closer to
[8176.57s -> 8189.21s]  this one. There's so much to do. This is ridiculous. No, I have three stars. How many stars can you get
[8189.21s -> 8209.67s]  max in this game? Six. Five. I can't. I hate. I don't want to do it, but you make me do it when
[8209.67s -> 8242.17s]  you say it. Holy shit. Scared me. Oops. Am I closer? Plus two dying joke. I know. Didn't you
[8242.17s -> 8261.22s]  yell about? I could hear you yell about from all the way over here. Door cut? Maybe. I think it's
[8261.22s -> 8275.05s]  up. Do I have to go on the highway? Come on, GPS. What the hell are you doing? Yeah. We'll take a
[8275.05s -> 8302.74s]  pee break in a minute. Doi, doi, doi, doi. Why is the GPS keep changing? Where is it? Stop. Why?
[8302.74s -> 8323.19s]  This GPS is not even on a road. What is this GPS telling me to do? What? I have to go underground.
[8324.33s -> 8342.31s]  Oh, hold on. Tag mission. Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,
[8342.31s -> 8346.97s]  more Aaron. No, I don't. You want to see more Aaron, just go watch Attack on Titan dub. It
[8346.97s -> 8368.30s]  happens every other episode. I love it. Dub an entire episode. I don't know. That's not
[8368.30s -> 8380.54s]  happening. This is literally all the game just fucking crashed. Shit. What was the last time
[8380.54s -> 8391.03s]  I saved it? It was pretty, it was pretty recent. I'll go pee. Yeah. We'll take a pee break. This is
[8391.03s -> 8395.75s]  a good time to take a break right after the last mission. That's all right. I'll be fine.
[8395.75s -> 8489.08s]  Pee break. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. All right. Now I'm actually BRB. I want to make
[8489.08s -> 8752.62s]  sure I can load the game back in. Be right back. I'm telling you. Ever since I got this 3090,
[8753.59s -> 8761.93s]  this room is 10 degrees hotter than it was before. It just is. I could be playing minesweeper. It
[8761.93s -> 8772.42s]  doesn't matter. Bathroom break joke. Where were you? Oh, I'm just taking a break. I'm just taking
[8772.42s -> 8787.96s]  a break. Whatever. What? I was looking at my tweets and I don't know what the fuck was going
[8787.96s -> 8796.52s]  on in Thanksgiving. I really don't. I can read you some of the drafts if you'd like. I didn't post
[8796.52s -> 8804.34s]  any of these. I don't know why, but maybe I do know why. Okay. Let's see. The first one that's
[8804.34s -> 8814.89s]  in the drafts is, I accidentally threw away the wrapper to my little turkey breast I got.
[8814.89s -> 8820.36s]  Is it 30, 40 minutes in the microwave? I didn't post it. I don't know. I don't understand why.
[8821.90s -> 8828.74s]  An empty M&M's packet smells like someone shit in your bathroom 30 minutes ago. That's true,
[8828.74s -> 8836.74s]  but I don't know why I didn't post that one either. And then I put pumpkin pie in F tier
[8836.74s -> 8842.89s]  two weeks ago. I just had it for the first time in years. I want to travel back in time and snap
[8842.89s -> 8855.83s]  that motherfucker's neck. All these I wrote, but I didn't post. I don't know why. But wouldn't that
[8855.83s -> 8869.54s]  kill me? That would kill like future me. Okay. But yeah, I had pumpkin pie and it was unbelievably
[8869.54s -> 8883.10s]  good. And by the way, the empty M&M's packet thing, go do it. Go do it. We'll see. Eat a little
[8883.10s -> 8890.58s]  packet of M&M's and then wait. Smell the wrapper. Inside. It's as if somebody's shit in your fucking
[8890.58s -> 8899.50s]  house and like almost an hour has gone by, but it's still kind of there. Yeah. None of these,
[8899.50s -> 8904.28s]  none of these hit hard for me. I don't know why. No tweets ever do. I always write a tweet and I
[8904.28s -> 8911.93s]  go, nah, I don't care. I open up Twitter once every month or two to make a tweet. I write the
[8911.93s -> 8921.22s]  tweet and then before I post it, I say, I don't care about this shit and I delete it. The microwave
[8921.22s -> 8925.62s]  one is a banger. Well, I also maybe didn't want people to think that I was actually doing that.
[8926.10s -> 8931.37s]  Blow up my house, right? I don't want people that like, even though I fuck around a lot,
[8931.37s -> 8943.34s]  people still think that that I'm like serious classic, but it's funny. Yeah. Well, I just read
[8943.34s -> 8955.42s]  them to you. Now it's okay. We know you do that. Please read. This is very important.
[8955.42s -> 8958.70s]  I've sent one of your videos to a girl I've been talking to and she stopped talking to me. Is that
[8958.70s -> 8971.64s]  what you said? I can't scroll up, but what are you doing? Okay. Let's go. I'm ready. I hope this
[8971.64s -> 8985.45s]  captures the capturing. Customize your crib here to gain style points. Ooh. Oh shit. Okay.
[8986.09s -> 9004.73s]  2000. What about pimp pad? Ooh, I like this. It's 4,000. I'll save up for it.
[9004.73s -> 9010.50s]  You're my auto Lala. You don't even like that video. You hated that until I did it like three
[9010.50s -> 9015.38s]  times and then I somehow like brainwashed you all. I've like brainwashed all of you to think that
[9015.38s -> 9020.90s]  some of these things are funny. Isn't that weird how that happened? I said Aaron one time in that
[9020.90s -> 9026.74s]  voice and everyone freaked out and said, I don't fucking do that ever again. I did it like 35,000
[9026.74s -> 9031.06s]  more times and now everybody wants it every stream. I did the Lala dog thing and everyone was like,
[9031.70s -> 9036.07s]  stop doing that. It's cringe. It sucks. You probably watched the video and now you want me
[9036.07s -> 9045.27s]  to do it every stream. Doy, doy, doy. I did that once and people, I saw like the stop, stop,
[9045.27s -> 9055.21s]  nay, nay, no, no, no emotes. All right. Let's go. I'm just stirring up my iced coffee. Don't drop
[9055.21s -> 9069.38s]  that. This is a repeat episode. They're all repeats. Understand? It's these are all repeats.
[9069.38s -> 9072.71s]  I can do a home theater. I don't have any money to even care about this right now.
[9078.79s -> 9087.42s]  Don't leave. Okay. Missions didn't play zombie uprising. It's too much going on. Wait,
[9087.42s -> 9105.86s]  I want to play zombie uprising. No, I don't like this. Okay. Let me explain. Super Nintendo
[9106.50s -> 9113.30s]  switch. Nintendo is burned in my brain. The B button on Nintendo, the back button is where the
[9113.30s -> 9126.89s]  A button is on the Xbox. It's A on Xbox is like, yes, do this thing. But that's B on Nintendo. And
[9126.89s -> 9134.76s]  I, it's ever since I was 15, 12, 11, doesn't matter. 10. This is a, I, that's not, they gotta
[9134.76s -> 9141.75s]  get on something here. They gotta be on the same page. Cause I'm, I'm right now it's crossed up,
[9141.75s -> 9147.37s]  confirm and back because they're flipped on the different consoles. Who cares? Then I want that.
[9147.37s -> 9151.13s]  I don't want to see the person's name ever again. If I see it again, I'm going to fucking,
[9151.13s -> 9159.67s]  I'm going to throw, I'm just throwing up thinking about that person. Okay. No, let's go. No, I want
[9159.67s -> 9183.96s]  to stop the zombie assault. Is this part of the mod? I think this is the mod. Um, what's one,
[9183.96s -> 9198.87s]  which, what is one, what button on the controller is one. I don't know what button it is. Is there
[9198.87s -> 9207.54s]  a weapon? How do I get out? How do I leave the game? Just kill me. I don't care. This is fun,
[9207.54s -> 9222.09s]  but whatever. Also having to hit back and then confirm the back instead of pressing back twice.
[9222.09s -> 9227.21s]  You know what I mean? You get it. You guys get it. I know you do. Is your stash. Ooh,
[9227.21s -> 9239.58s]  take money. Should I put, should I put money in the stash and people steal from me or rob me or
[9239.58s -> 9245.56s]  something? All right. I need to do this mayhem mission again, because that's where we left off.
[9245.56s -> 9260.70s]  This one's a hundred thousand. I can definitely do it. That's passive income. Oh, that's cool.
[9272.71s -> 9305.13s]  Oh, shit. I forgot about this. Let me try a few in his drink. Not quite. Oh, come on. It's
[9305.13s -> 9313.93s]  right there. Let me just do this, please. Okay. Here we go. No, wait. I, this is for the video.
[9346.14s -> 9355.34s]  Am I asleep? I don't know. You might be. How do you type that if you're asleep? You make no sense.
[9355.34s -> 9376.71s]  Ban that person. No music. All right. Well, we need to have other music then. Cause I can't
[9376.71s -> 9389.72s]  play the one that's on here. I'm not playing Kevin McLeod. No thanks. He's really, really,
[9390.36s -> 9395.64s]  he's got, he's really talented, really great. Did awesome shit for the entire YouTube community.
[9395.64s -> 9400.20s]  When all the people were like, what are we going to do for music? It's great. It's awesome. But I
[9400.20s -> 9406.31s]  don't want to listen to it. Like what, what a hero. What an absolute fucking just may gave everybody
[9406.31s -> 9425.02s]  music to use. Wait, hold on. It's blocking me. Why is this bench that much stronger than the other
[9425.02s -> 9446.31s]  benches? This is the strap right here. They just respawn. No, they don't. My whole face is itchy.
[9446.31s -> 9468.84s]  Hold on. What the fuck is happening? Hey, good. I got two minutes to do this. I got it.
[9471.38s -> 9491.19s]  This is the slowest fucking car I could possibly use to do this. Come on, break it. Oh God,
[9491.19s -> 9523.66s]  whatever. Stop. Just get up here. I just have to get a car. Why did I even get out of that car?
[9523.66s -> 9535.37s]  Use grenades. I have grenades. Don't make any sudden moves. Oh my God. I have grenades. You're
[9535.37s -> 9548.49s]  right. Oh fuck. I'm down. That's your fault. I blame you for that shit. I blame you for that. I
[9548.49s -> 9568.95s]  don't know. I freaked out. I'm doing it again. I blame you for that. I really do. This is so much
[9568.95s -> 9576.46s]  easy. This is easy with just grenades. This is like too easy doing this. Just breaking stuff.
[9578.62s -> 9591.22s]  How am I so fat? I have a mod. Don't run into the grenade. You idiot. This is a cheap strategy.
[9593.34s -> 9599.69s]  Yeah, I just put in the cheat codes in GTA and just went to the rocket launcher and then I got
[9599.69s -> 9607.06s]  bored. You know what I mean? I got bored. Fuck. I did the cheat codes and I took out the rocket
[9607.06s -> 9617.26s]  launcher. The game's no longer fun anymore. Use the true meta. Drive over fences. I'll try that.
[9617.26s -> 9638.89s]  I don't want to throw this. I got two minutes to get to 10,000. Don't ever get on a motorcycle
[9638.89s -> 9655.08s]  ever again, Jeremy. Seriously, what are you doing? Let's try fence strat. I mean, fence strat is
[9655.08s -> 9678.74s]  perfect. That's actually a great strategy. I got it. Who is she shooting at? 250. That's it.
[9691.51s -> 9694.39s]  Okay. Save the game. Let's try this again. Hopefully it doesn't crash again.
[9694.95s -> 9716.31s]  I will be sad if this crashes again. That's literally right here. I don't think I've
[9716.31s -> 9722.92s]  blinked in two hours. Has that ever happened to you guys where you finally end up blinking
[9722.92s -> 9760.47s]  a couple times and your eyes are hurt and they're watery? Shake the can. Hurry up. Hurry up. Okay.
[9760.47s -> 9768.62s]  Game is saved. Don't crash. Please don't crash. Don't crash. Yes. We're good.
[9793.61s -> 9795.29s]  These guys are bad guys. These people are awful.
[9799.45s -> 9803.61s]  You said it yourself. Most of the old crew are either dead or busted by Troy.
[9803.61s -> 9807.37s]  We're going to have to start fresh. Yeah. Well, let's get on that because I'm done mopping up
[9807.37s -> 9812.57s]  blood. That's the point. Yeah, no shit. It seems all right, but we're going to need more. What's
[9812.57s -> 9817.61s]  you thinking? Yo, I met some people in jail who might work. Let me make some calls. Once I find
[9817.61s -> 9820.57s]  out where these bitches are, you're going to have to show them that you're the real deal though.
[9820.57s -> 9826.73s]  They won't just follow anybody. It won't be a problem. Hey, before you go, what sort of crew
[9826.73s -> 9835.96s]  are you looking for? I'm looking for people that are strong, smart, can work on the fly,
[9836.76s -> 9856.30s]  who know right from wrong, integrity, the ability to cook large meals,
[9857.02s -> 9862.07s]  feed everybody because how are we going to do that? I don't know how to cook. We're going to
[9862.07s -> 9865.59s]  have like 50 people in this. This is what happens when you just talk and you don't play video games.
[9870.28s -> 9877.69s]  Okay. But yeah, like seriously, we're going to have like 50 people in the crew in the same place.
[9878.49s -> 9883.21s]  We have to have like catering. One of the first people has to be a caterer in the group.
[9883.21s -> 9907.43s]  That's important. Like a tax attorney, right? These are all things you need. Pharmacy, a pharmacist.
[9907.43s -> 9941.40s]  Yeah, I would join the gang if it had a caterer. You need to have, if I was going to have a gang,
[9941.40s -> 9961.67s]  I'd want to have like a couple of teachers, two or three doctors. I'm not even describing
[9961.67s -> 9966.87s]  a gang at this point. I'm describing like your neighbor, like your neighbors, like a community.
[9967.75s -> 9972.01s]  It's not even, this is just like, oh yeah, that's just like a community of people.
[9972.57s -> 9976.97s]  We have like a few, we have doctors, we have nurses, we have workers, we have like,
[9976.97s -> 9986.98s]  this is just like houses. What am I talking about? I'm not even describing a gang. I'm describing
[9987.54s -> 9993.00s]  like, I'm describing like a YMCA. You know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, we've got like a gym,
[9993.00s -> 10011.14s]  we've got like people like, we've got doctors, we've got nurses, we've got a pool, play the game.
[10011.14s -> 10020.26s]  Fuck, I'm sorry. I know, I know, you know it. Oh, is he okay? Is he okay? Please get his money.
[10020.26s -> 10025.18s]  Where are you going? I don't know. I'm not paying attention. This is what happens. I just start
[10025.18s -> 10031.64s]  talking and I just drive in circles. Please bear with me. Well, I have to go to the one over here.
[10032.20s -> 10053.46s]  Just take your time. All right, I don't know what the mission is. Is the mission to kill this
[10053.46s -> 10066.84s]  person? Is the mission to recruit this person? Are you a caterer? You've experienced anything
[10066.84s -> 10080.71s]  like Italian Mediterranean food? Because that's what I want to have. You're not a chef. Do you
[10080.71s -> 10095.27s]  know any chefs? Oops. Do you want stuff to crust? I have to go off the jump? What jump?
[10095.67s -> 10110.04s]  Are you impressed? Are you impressed? That was pretty crazy, wasn't it? Well, what's with this
[10110.04s -> 10118.22s]  gigantic blob here? Well, how do I have to go? Okay, I get it. I'm just driving to the indicator.
[10118.22s -> 10124.90s]  Follow me. We'll do it on a motorcycle and then I guarantee you're going to die.
[10125.91s -> 10141.16s]  Just to make sure we're all aware of this. It's almost like I would put my arms around you to
[10141.16s -> 10154.81s]  hold on, but I can't. Where the fuck is this? I don't understand what I have to do here.
[10155.53s -> 10173.99s]  I have to jump that? Oh, is there a right there? Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We're good.
[10186.28s -> 10205.11s]  Get the fuck out of the way. Are we good? Do you care? Are we friends? We're still alive. That's
[10205.11s -> 10217.74s]  good. So there's three more jumps to hit. Follow me. What? Oh, wait. I don't know how much more
[10217.74s -> 10230.55s]  of this. Is she injured? Okay. Where's this next one? Just get it on the map. Here we finally.
[10230.55s -> 10243.88s]  Okay. What just happened? I don't know. All right. All right. All right. All right. It's right there.
[10245.62s -> 10269.32s]  Is it this mound? Did I count? It didn't count. Good times. Good times.
[10277.70s -> 10285.88s]  Oh, sorry. I was trying to kill her. I was just trying to dump her and now I have to do this
[10285.88s -> 10293.13s]  again. I'm so fucking sorry. I'm actually sorry. I didn't really, I did not think it was going to
[10293.13s -> 10303.10s]  kill me. I thought I was going to kill her. Oh fuck. Whatever. I'm sorry. It wasn't even worth it.
[10303.10s -> 10305.58s]  I thought it was going to just, the car is going to blow up or something. I don't know.
[10309.42s -> 10317.75s]  I'll get it really quick right now. I promise. Don't leave. Stay. If I don't finish this mission
[10318.39s -> 10323.75s]  in the next hour, like this one right here, to get the three jumps, like this, just with her to
[10323.75s -> 10332.57s]  jump over the three jumps, just this part of this mission here, an hour, I will give 500 trillion
[10332.57s -> 10345.86s]  community subs. Just this part here would just go to the three jumps. That's it. There's this, this,
[10346.18s -> 10359.13s]  section of this mission. I have an hour. God, I hope my power doesn't go up.
[10362.06s -> 10365.10s]  Why am I freaking out? I have an hour to do a mission that takes 10 seconds.
[10365.74s -> 10372.81s]  Oh, by the way, by the way, if, even if my power goes out, if I, if I do it,
[10372.81s -> 10375.93s]  it doesn't matter. Even if like the stream turns off, it doesn't fucking matter. I can do it here.
[10377.45s -> 10385.72s]  Just this part right here, this one, that's it. Just do the jumps. I didn't say it had to be on
[10385.72s -> 10391.56s]  screen, by the way. I just had to say I had to do it in an hour. By the way, I could literally,
[10391.56s -> 10394.12s]  I'm just going to, if my power goes out or something, I'm literally going to go download
[10394.12s -> 10405.35s]  this on the switch and play it in my bathroom and just do it and do it. So it counts. Get on. Quick.
[10407.99s -> 10420.23s]  I'm not fucking around. I can't right now, even if it's impossible to lose.
[10421.19s -> 10452.89s]  That counts. I did. Yep. Good. Cool. There's no reason for me to freak out about this. I have
[10452.89s -> 10461.43s]  plenty of time. And I know somebody probably going to say, no, I did not say an hour in dog years.
[10462.23s -> 10510.25s]  An hour in human years. There's two. Oh my God. All right. I'm done. I got it. Mission complete.
[10516.66s -> 10532.34s]  I did it. It's been completed. I can't redrive from checkpoint. I can't redrive.
[10532.34s -> 10540.81s]  It's done. She's good. We did it. It's over. I'm done. That section wasn't complete. Even if I died,
[10540.81s -> 10546.57s]  it doesn't matter. That section was already complete. Look, I told you just that section.
[10546.57s -> 10574.92s]  It was very clear. I would like a new weapon, special thrown flash bangs. That's so expensive.
[10574.92s -> 10590.36s]  Why don't I just buy that? That's stupid. I think it's 2000 too much. This is too expensive.
[10590.36s -> 10614.38s]  300 bucks. Dude. Double or nothing. Double or nothing. No, no double or nothing. It's over.
[10615.18s -> 10635.42s]  Oh, that cross sucks. Nevermind. Oh, what am I doing? Let's go. We'll go right here.
[10635.42s -> 10647.62s]  Double or nothing. That's stupid. There's so many old people here. Everybody's old. All right. What
[10647.62s -> 10676.09s]  do you want me to do? You got it. Get in the car. I made this very easy. Oh, hey, what the
[10676.09s -> 10680.17s]  fuck are you doing? Why did you? What would you do that for? Why would you do that? I don't want you
[10680.17s -> 10684.49s]  on the team. I don't want you. I don't want you part of the guild or whatever this is. I know
[10684.49s -> 10694.65s]  that was stupid. What you did was dumb and now we're in trouble. No, I'm kicking you from the
[10694.65s -> 10717.08s]  guild. Help me. You took the cop hostage. Who is this? No, no, no, no, no. Where's the crowbar?
[10717.08s -> 10738.17s]  How'd you get a crowbar? I want that. Where are you going? Okay. Let's get the fuck out of here.
[10738.17s -> 10782.86s]  Wait, it's over here. We're going to sneak up on them. Where are they? Where are they? What do
[10782.86s -> 10792.39s]  you think about that? What do you think about that one? Don't fall off. Although it'd be kind
[10792.39s -> 10826.97s]  of funny if you did. Is that going to kill him? He's blazed. What? Wait, hold on. Does this reset
[10826.97s -> 10841.48s]  the mission if he falls? Does it? I don't think it will. Oh my god, he's fine and he can't even
[10841.48s -> 10848.33s]  fall off this. Oh, whatever. I'm gone. Why do you guys think I'm zonked? What are you talking about?
[10848.33s -> 10864.57s]  How am I zonked? I told you I was drinking coffee. There's one more person this way.
[10864.57s -> 10893.14s]  What kind of coffee? An iced coffee. Let's go. An iced coffee. Busy. I made it myself.
[10894.50s -> 10899.94s]  Well, I couldn't let my boyfriend. You know, a guy from jail. You know, it's like 7 p.m. where I am.
[10899.94s -> 10904.90s]  It's 5 20. He's happy enough when he's killing somebody. You don't drink coffee up to 6 p.m.
[10904.90s -> 10911.22s]  Seriously. That's it. I got enough to go till 6. Brew your own coffee? Well, I mean, yeah.
[10915.94s -> 10919.78s]  Would you guys like to know the best beans of coffee to use for any occasion?
[10920.42s -> 10930.31s]  You want me to tell you? I will. It's nothing fancy. It's nothing like, oh wow, you got those
[10930.39s -> 10936.39s]  beans from some random plant. You imported them from a different country. No. The Illy coffee
[10936.39s -> 10942.55s]  beans are the best. They just are. Without a doubt. S plus tier. They do everything. Hot coffee.
[10942.55s -> 10953.24s]  Fantastic. They do iced coffee. Fantastic. Illy. It's in a little tin. A little tin can. That's the
[10953.24s -> 10957.72s]  best coffee beans you can possibly buy. If you're not drinking Illy, here's what's going to happen.
[10957.72s -> 10960.76s]  You're going to drink Illy for a little while and be like, oh, this is perfect. What a perfect cup
[10960.76s -> 10965.00s]  of fucking coffee. And then you're going to drink something else and go, oh, this is, this is good.
[10965.00s -> 10968.36s]  This is okay. You're going to pretend to like it. You're going to get like an expensive coffee
[10968.36s -> 10971.96s]  and pretend to enjoy it because you want to seem like you know what you're talking about.
[10973.98s -> 10978.62s]  Then you're going to eventually go back to Illy and say, yeah, why did I ever leave? There's no
[10978.62s -> 10992.30s]  reason to. All right. Back at the, oh, I have to tell this. It's just a really good, nice, smooth
[10992.30s -> 11001.02s]  cup of coffee. Illy. I-L-L-Y. I think. Coffee snob, Andy. You can get this at any grocery store.
[11001.66s -> 11012.62s]  How do I pick this up? I don't want to hurt this person. Oh my God. I'm running over stuff.
[11014.10s -> 11022.39s]  Left control. And what is it? I don't have no idea what those buttons are. There it is.
[11022.95s -> 11025.29s]  Okay. Hold until the vehicle is there.
[11037.53s -> 11048.31s]  Okay. Yeah, no, I'm not sponsored to say that. No. Illy coffee beans does not sponsor,
[11048.31s -> 11070.54s]  they don't sponsor people. I, I'm just telling you what I truly believe. That's it. How do you
[11070.54s -> 11080.95s]  grind the beans? Grinder. Freshest cup of coffee you can get is when you grind beans. Grind your
[11080.95s -> 11088.89s]  beans, put it right in after grinding. That was on purpose, but it wasn't somehow.
[11089.69s -> 11102.92s]  I didn't, I have, whatever. I'm using the car as a, what the fuck are you doing? I didn't press
[11102.92s -> 11113.64s]  that. I didn't press that. I promise I didn't press that button. What kind of roast is it?
[11113.64s -> 11126.50s]  I think it's just a, oh, the goddamn game crashed. God damn it. Are you kidding me? No. Oh no.
[11128.84s -> 11140.89s]  Wait, the timer? Wait, hold on. How long has it been? No, that counts because I did it and
[11140.97s -> 11160.44s]  you say it was completed on the stream. Uh, oh fuck. What? Are you kidding me? That's such
[11160.44s -> 11166.23s]  horse shit. All right. I have to start to save after every single thing I do now.
[11166.95s -> 11191.24s]  Now I'm actually concerned about this. Yes, it does count. You have 45 minutes left. Stop
[11191.24s -> 11220.41s]  fucking around and go. Hurry. Oh, please. Tap the game's FPS to 10. I don't think I want to do that.
[11220.41s -> 11230.81s]  Turn cheats on. No, I've never experienced this game before. I'm not going right to the cheats.
[11231.45s -> 11237.06s]  I'm enjoying Saints Row 2, the video game, as it was intended by the video game's development.
[11244.22s -> 11248.55s]  I think it's running pretty good. I mean, it's a little chunky sometimes, but I think it's fine.
[11249.19s -> 11255.38s]  I swear, what roast? Please. Um, I think it was just the just the standard roast. Just the
[11255.38s -> 11262.06s]  regular roast. It's the red can. Ili has like three or four different cans. It's the one that's the
[11262.06s -> 11272.38s]  red can. That's the red letters. No, it's not roast beef. It's just standard roast. I don't know
[11272.38s -> 11284.12s]  what that I don't know. How do you not know the can? It's your favorite coffee. I don't I don't
[11284.12s -> 11289.48s]  know. It's whatever it is. It's like breakfast roast, regular roast, yum roast, eat roast,
[11290.20s -> 11294.60s]  pork roast. It doesn't matter. The coffee is good. It's the red can. Just buy the red can.
[11304.22s -> 11307.90s]  You know what they do? They have an espresso blend too. And that's also good. I've had that
[11307.90s -> 11331.69s]  one before. Holy shit. Ili is owned by Folgers. Okay, wait a minute before. Oh, no, it's owned
[11331.69s -> 11337.61s]  by Folgers. It's a Folgers coffee. Oh, no. You mean the thing that you can go get a fucking tub of
[11337.61s -> 11344.14s]  it. It's literally like the cheapest like you can get a whole tub of Folgers for probably less than
[11344.14s -> 11349.38s]  10 bucks. It'll last you like three months. Sometimes coffee is just coffee. And that's all
[11349.38s -> 11354.34s]  you need. You don't have like, look, I Okay, oh, I'd like a cappuccino. I'll take a macchiato,
[11354.34s -> 11360.98s]  please. Yeah, but just a regular just cup of coffee in your coffee maker. Who cares? It's not
[11360.98s -> 11365.70s]  look, you can get some nice stuff if you want. But on a day to day basis, stop shooting at people.
[11365.70s -> 11379.32s]  Why? I actually like Folger. I don't think Folgers is bad. It's just regular just regular coffee,
[11379.32s -> 11388.20s]  just diner coffee. That's not a problem. Look, some coffees are kind of gross, even like the
[11388.20s -> 11396.46s]  really nice expensive ones. Get out of the car quick. Please get out of the car. Get out of the
[11396.46s -> 11411.05s]  car. Get away from for explodes. Thank you. Support your local coffee roasters. There's actually a few
[11411.05s -> 11417.35s]  that are really good out here. I've had but it's just in your cupboard. Just coffee. It's just you
[11417.43s -> 11427.48s]  can just it's always there. It's always available. By the way, I did it. See? Done. No, I didn't have
[11427.48s -> 11442.62s]  three more to do. Shit. Not sponsored by the way. I'm not why why would I be sponsored by a coffee
[11442.62s -> 11448.68s]  company? But I've what I'm just not going to announce that I have like a major new sponsorship.
[11448.68s -> 11465.34s]  I'm just gonna say bye. You need to buy Italy. When I have to disclose that for the fucking
[11465.34s -> 11473.53s]  FAA regulations or whatever. It's good times. Whenever you're getting everyone together. Let
[11473.53s -> 11489.05s]  me know. I'd love to roll with you guys. Okay, save it. You're safe. We're good. Now please get
[11489.05s -> 11502.36s]  out of the way so I don't hurt you. We're good. I love Italy. Yeah, it's very it's really good.
[11503.00s -> 11508.73s]  I've had a lot of coffee in my life. And it's probably the best one that I've had. That's just
[11508.73s -> 11513.38s]  a regular good cup of coffee. There's nothing else I need to say to you. I don't need to prove
[11513.38s -> 11530.86s]  that it's good coffee. Just get it. I have to prove it. I'm gonna run with you. I want to see
[11531.66s -> 11540.47s]  Well, what would you guys consider as good coffee to have is beans or ground? What do you buy?
[11541.03s -> 11547.78s]  If it's not illy? What is it? Folgers? What is it? Folgers? Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[11548.42s -> 11552.34s]  I'm seeing a lot of Folgers and a lot of you are Folgers haters for some reason.
[11553.54s -> 11579.72s]  Costco brand? That's good too. Trader Joe's? That's good too. Good. Starbucks? No, if I'm
[11579.72s -> 11588.25s]  going to buy coffee, it's not going to be Starbucks beans. It just isn't. Buying Starbucks beans is not
[11589.13s -> 11594.30s]  No, you can just go to Starbucks and get it. There's Starbucks in every fucking one mile.
[11594.30s -> 11597.66s]  It's not like special. You can't there's no like Folgers you can get.
[11598.30s -> 11601.50s]  Now like I'm going to go to the Folgers store and get a Folgers from the Folgers cafe.
[11602.14s -> 11633.27s]  No, I actually don't really even like Starbucks coffee that much. It's okay. Nice. Meet me at the
[11633.27s -> 11658.04s]  abandoned mission house. I'll be there. He's trying to dodge him. Thank you. Why buy Starbucks beans?
[11658.04s -> 11665.94s]  You can just go and get it from the store for 10 times more. Yeah, okay. I understand. I know. I
[11665.94s -> 11671.32s]  understand what you mean. But there is something to be said about having being somewhere out
[11671.32s -> 11677.11s]  somewhere. It's like, you know what? Yeah, I'll take a coffee. I'll take a nice iced coffee.
[11678.74s -> 11689.91s]  It's nice. Sometimes you just want to have like be holding around a coffee while you're walking
[11689.91s -> 11698.81s]  around just hanging out. Iced coffee is better from a cafe. It usually is. It's really difficult
[11698.81s -> 11704.33s]  to make an iced coffee at home that's actually as good as like a cafe. And I know I haven't figured
[11704.33s -> 11712.14s]  out why. I don't get it. I've tried everything. The iced coffee I make is really good. But it's
[11712.14s -> 11726.95s]  not the same. Get loads of sugar. No, I don't get. I don't put sugar in my coffee. Not usually. Maybe
[11726.95s -> 11733.67s]  like one. I don't put them in sugar in a coffee. I usually drink hot coffee black and iced coffee
[11733.67s -> 11745.82s]  with almond milk or oat milk and maybe like one pump of some syrup or something. But I can't
[11745.82s -> 11760.20s]  replicate it at home. That person went through the windshield. Holy shit. My brother's been looking
[11760.20s -> 11762.76s]  for a good recipe. I missed that. What did they say? My brother's looking for a good recipe?
[11763.48s -> 11769.51s]  I missed that. Somebody said my brother's looking for a good recipe for something. I
[11769.51s -> 11783.94s]  didn't see what it was. Oh my god. Damn it. Just fucking go. That guy walked into the car.
[11783.94s -> 11791.16s]  That was not even my fault. Where the fuck is the car?
[11814.92s -> 11820.28s]  Did you have a car on the back like a bicycle? Enough about coffee. Are we talking about this
[11820.28s -> 11832.12s]  too long? I'm really worried if you drive like this in real life. I don't drive like this. This
[11832.12s -> 11841.46s]  is a video game. You don't drive a car with an analog stick and in a cartoon video game universe.
[11842.10s -> 11867.51s]  The hell is about your Civic? Don't distract me right now. Do an IRL driving stream. No,
[11867.51s -> 11880.22s]  why would I do that? I don't want to do that. Why would I do that? This is getting ridiculous.
[11886.94s -> 11896.73s]  They... Okay, we're good. What the fuck? That scared the shit out of me. I was looking over
[11896.73s -> 11911.85s]  the chat. What the hell is going on? I had to do some canonizing. Hold up. You. You're next.
[11912.57s -> 11918.57s]  Wait, what? Sorry about that. When did you find these guys? Like I said, I made some calls.
[11918.57s -> 11921.13s]  Yeah, the character is a mod that makes the sliders much higher.
[11923.02s -> 11925.50s]  The gentleman of the row. It's been great so far.
[11936.57s -> 11937.21s]  Giving a speech?
[11958.06s -> 11962.22s]  Pierce, you're on the Ronin. I want to know who's calling the shots and what businesses
[11962.22s -> 11968.20s]  they're running. Done. Shandy, you got the sons of Shandy. It's gotta be them. Fuck you, sir.
[11968.20s -> 11972.12s]  Do you ever have kids? It's cool. I got this. No, I've shit my pants in the last year. Carlos.
[11972.12s -> 11977.48s]  I can't handle it. I wouldn't be able to do it. All right. Once we're done here,
[11977.48s -> 11981.72s]  talk to one of these guys. They'll have something for you to do. It's our time now.
[11981.72s -> 11999.56s]  Let's get this shit started. That means you must be good at changing diapers. Okay,
[11999.56s -> 12014.78s]  you now recruit a single saint follower. Press up to recruit nearby saints. Okay, cool. So I can have
[12014.78s -> 12025.45s]  a one-person crew. All right, so there are more symbols popping up here. What do these mean?
[12026.17s -> 12035.14s]  Start of Ronin mission? Start the sons of... Hello? Hey, hey, be cool. It's not so bad.
[12035.14s -> 12039.14s]  Mero asked to sit down and have a chat with you. He wants to work something out before things get
[12039.14s -> 12055.46s]  out of control. I got it. Okay, there's a lot going on here. What's that? A drink?
[12060.73s -> 12068.39s]  I wanted more of that. There are diverging quest lines. It's an RPG. Really?
[12072.92s -> 12079.08s]  That's actually pretty cool. I want to do this one. No, I want to do one of the
[12079.08s -> 12085.62s]  just random missions. This game's really fun. You know what sucks? We talked about...
[12085.62s -> 12101.90s]  Because this is THQ, right? Yeah. This is THQ, right? Here comes the THQ rant.
[12106.01s -> 12111.91s]  Well, you know what I'm going to say. Who saw that?
[12117.77s -> 12133.67s]  All right. Can you get arrested? What's going on? I'm looking over there.
[12133.67s -> 12166.20s]  I'm not paying attention to these two. Come on, do it. Oh my God. Fine. Never mind. The drip.
[12175.58s -> 12179.74s]  Stop. Everybody stop. I'm warning them. I'm trying to warn them.
[12188.07s -> 12197.43s]  How did I drive by it? What's the diamond? Oh, what's the... I want to go to the diamond.
[12197.43s -> 12216.90s]  No, I want to throw my head on the thing. I want to throw this person. Can I rob this place?
[12216.98s -> 12239.62s]  Jewelry stores allow you to customize your character. Oh, rob your weapon? I got to get the...
[12246.73s -> 12255.06s]  Okay. I guess I'll take... Do you have any silver? You guys have any silver? I'm looking for
[12255.06s -> 12267.14s]  sterling silver. Why can't I... She's got a knife. Why does this not work? This thing fucking sucks.
[12270.95s -> 12288.84s]  Why does this not work? She took a picture of me.
[12291.70s -> 12295.78s]  She thought if you have a knife, you're just going to take pictures. What are you doing?
[12297.43s -> 12324.49s]  Give me this register. No, I'm slowing down. I need to get back in the car. Give me the money
[12324.49s -> 12362.81s]  that's in there. How do I break it? How do I... Do I have to step on it? What the fuck? This thing's
[12362.81s -> 12384.63s]  not broken. It's not broken. What the fuck, dude? Is it... Can I... Tell me if I'm wrong or not. Can
[12384.63s -> 12408.55s]  I actually do this? You can't. Okay. Well, what the hell am I doing? All right. Get the cops off.
[12408.55s -> 12449.03s]  You have to do fine aim at the store clerk to do a robbery. Okay. No, don't play the fucking
[12449.03s -> 12479.93s]  harmonica. I want to eat the food. How do I eat the food? Eat it. Quick, quick, quick. No, fuck
[12479.93s -> 12517.45s]  around. They're outside. She just went through the window. She went through the passenger window.
[12517.45s -> 12541.48s]  What? Who is she shooting at? I'm very confused as to what just happened. Oh, it's this guy. I'm
[12541.48s -> 12563.00s]  going to see how this plays out. Here he comes. We're out. Oh, shit. It's here. What is this?
[12563.00s -> 12584.20s]  Car shop? Get that off the screen. I don't know. What is this? Go find a swindle. Oh, I found it.
[12590.18s -> 12606.31s]  Why are you going so fast? They're gone. No, don't. No, do not. No, don't. Shoot the gun.
[12607.27s -> 12629.64s]  Shoot the gun, you imbecile. You're the worst gamer alive. No, I'm not. I lost them. Where are they,
[12629.64s -> 12652.62s]  though? They show up randomly, don't they? Five of them were just on the screen. Come on, spawn one.
[12652.62s -> 12667.54s]  What am I doing? I'm looking for one of these cars. Sorry, I had to blink really hard. My eyes
[12667.54s -> 12689.32s]  are watering. Is there no other one of these cars? I was trying to bait the cop to go over
[12689.32s -> 12711.85s]  there and they didn't. Why won't one of these show up? They show up in different districts.
[12711.85s -> 12734.73s]  Here we go. This one is a million. What the hell? They desperately get out. Get out, please. I'm
[12734.73s -> 12756.81s]  not going to kill anybody. This thing is so slow. This is the slowest car ever. There's a lot of
[12756.81s -> 12782.25s]  extra weight in here. I just joined. Why is he an ogre? A thousand bucks. Nice. Oh, I can't wait
[12782.25s -> 12788.95s]  later on. I'm going to get takeout and watch Ernest Saves Christmas. An absolute fucking classic
[12788.95s -> 12816.12s]  movie. I can't wait. Let's go over here. Should I do one of the main missions? Yeah, if you don't
[12816.12s -> 12824.07s]  watch Ernest Saves Christmas in the next couple weeks, don't come back to this stream. I have to
[12824.07s -> 12830.71s]  be very, very realistic. If you do not watch Ernest Saves Christmas in the next three or four weeks,
[12831.35s -> 12851.02s]  don't come back here. What if you don't celebrate Christmas? All right. Well, let me rephrase that.
[12851.02s -> 12857.66s]  Let me rephrase that. I mean, if you celebrate Christmas, okay, then you don't watch Ernest
[12857.66s -> 12866.09s]  Saves Christmas. All right. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm an idiot. I'll take that loss. If you celebrate
[12866.09s -> 12869.85s]  Christmas, you don't watch Ernest Saves Christmas, then you're in deep shit if you come back here.
[12870.57s -> 12883.91s]  In fact, you know what? No, let's go even further. You got to go watch all the Ernest movies in the
[12883.91s -> 12893.05s]  next month or don't come back. By the way, you got to get started. There's like 15 of them.
[12903.93s -> 12916.50s]  You can do this. You can do it. You can do it. Come on, please. I know you're capable of doing this.
[12931.91s -> 12965.78s]  Come on, get the fuck out of here. Get up there. Get up there. You piece of shit. Did that kill me?
[12966.34s -> 12995.08s]  Here we go. What's this thing? This is my garage. Oh, it's a garage guy. Can I eat one of these?
[13001.67s -> 13008.14s]  All right. This mission is a brotherhood mission. What's the one behind it?
[13008.70s -> 13021.48s]  It's two. Is that inside? When are you going to do an Ernest tier list movie? Soon. I mean,
[13021.48s -> 13025.64s]  it's not going to be very long content because every single one of them is an S tier.
[13026.36s -> 13041.53s]  What in the name of God just happened in here? What the fuck? He was doing like,
[13042.57s -> 13055.14s]  this person has to be stopped, right? I have to stop this person. I'm trying to save you.
[13063.86s -> 13067.30s]  Gang strongholds are centers of operation for each gang. Find and wipe them all out
[13067.30s -> 13082.50s]  to deal hard blows to each gang. Okay. That person was on my team. He was red on the mini
[13082.50s -> 13092.15s]  map. I don't think so. Oh, we're doing this shit again. I don't want to do this.
[13093.19s -> 13121.51s]  No, I don't want to. I'm not killing anybody. No, I refuse. Except for these two. This is
[13121.51s -> 13128.86s]  Dark Souls area. It is. Yeah. This is like blight. This is like the entrance to blight town.
[13129.82s -> 13143.91s]  The bridges, the little corridors, the little ledges. Oh, I can't wait to play Elden Ring.
[13144.55s -> 13161.42s]  Do I have to even be hostile? Wait, that's not, I don't have to destroy that. All right. I'm not,
[13161.42s -> 13165.99s]  look, I'm just, let me go. Holy shit. There's so many people here. Are you kidding me?
[13166.71s -> 13170.31s]  There's like, there's like 500 people here. How am I going to do this?
[13178.25s -> 13193.93s]  I don't even want to be violent. I don't want, I don't, I want non-violence. I just need to get,
[13193.93s -> 13201.80s]  okay, hold on. I'm so fat. I can just run into them. Perfect. Nobody has to get hurt.
[13209.59s -> 13221.13s]  What the fuck? It didn't work on this one. Good. All right. We're done. We're done. We're done.
[13221.13s -> 13235.38s]  We're done. We're done. I don't have to do anything. We're good. Jim Varney's character,
[13235.38s -> 13238.90s]  Ernest P. Warrell, was created by the Nashville advertising agency and we used it. Oh yeah. He
[13238.90s -> 13245.75s]  did local commercials. The best one is when he has his hands on the windowsill and he's like,
[13245.75s -> 13251.35s]  hey, Vern. He leans in, he's talking about milk. He's like, I have for you the best creamiest yogurt
[13251.35s -> 13257.51s]  in all the world. And then Vern grabs it from his hand and the windowsill lands like flies down and
[13257.51s -> 13271.14s]  hits him in the hands. And he's like, entire Ernest advertising line is perfect. He's on a
[13271.14s -> 13279.02s]  ladder. At one point he gets pushed back and he falls off the roof. Immune to ads. I'm sorry. I
[13279.02s -> 13290.92s]  will buy whatever Ernest tells me to. I don't care what it is. I need to be more, have more respect
[13290.92s -> 13317.80s]  for this one. Okay. What about, what's this? Did I lose respect? I already know all this.
[13317.80s -> 13328.18s]  There's a train in the game. All right. We found a new thing to play with. Not yet. Which one's the
[13338.38s -> 13356.52s]  Get out of here. You're fucking dead. Excuse me. What was that for? Yeah. You know what? I can't
[13356.52s -> 13361.24s]  understand. Uh, look, you know how movies over the years, like they get like, oh, cult followings or
[13361.24s -> 13368.95s]  whatever. It, it, it is, it is insulting to me that most of the Ernest movies have like 20% on
[13368.95s -> 13383.58s]  Rotten Tomatoes. I can't, I honestly don't understand. I can't understand. That's unbelievable
[13383.58s -> 13388.62s]  to me because they're not good. That's what you just said is unbelievable to me. And what you just
[13388.62s -> 13397.74s]  said is very hurtful to me. What you just said is very hurtful to me. Stop. Don't say that.
[13398.38s -> 13414.49s]  I want that bike. Not that one. That one's dirty. I want the one that's clean and hasn't been used
[13414.49s -> 13435.75s]  or destroyed. Oh, this chop chop. You fucking idiot. No. Hold on. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
[13435.75s -> 13440.71s]  What's wrong with me? What am I doing? What am I doing on the ground? What's wrong with my character?
[13442.14s -> 13472.79s]  Uh, what you were busted a small amount of cash and they, the metal detector doesn't even work.
[13472.79s -> 13497.51s]  I like take it. Can I steal something? I'm not in trouble. Not yet. Move out of the way. I don't
[13497.51s -> 13531.72s]  want to hit you a little bit further. You kidding me? Fine. The chairs. I just like home alone to
[13531.72s -> 13553.93s]  this guy. This guy can't even move. He can't get up. I'm not in trouble for that. It's what
[13553.93s -> 13589.05s]  happened. What exploded at that? I didn't get in trouble. All right. I'm going to go do that.
[13589.05s -> 13604.18s]  One of the missions I can do. Oh, this is one of the chop chop. That was unbelievable that
[13604.18s -> 13610.18s]  that happened. Yeah. I even tried to break. That was actually unbelievable. That was unbelievable.
[13626.70s -> 13630.62s]  I thought I could go right through it. It's a fucking, it's a white picket fence.
[13631.58s -> 13646.90s]  It's not like concrete. There's 2000 bucks. Holy shit. I should just do this for a little while.
[13647.38s -> 13692.65s]  Oh shit. What can I, I need more respect. I guess I'm more close too. This one is trail blazing.
[13692.65s -> 13711.38s]  I'm curious what that is. That guy didn't even move. Holy shit. Where do you get the hamburger?
[13711.38s -> 13732.79s]  I want that. All right. Don't do that anymore. I bet you get points for riding a wheelie for
[13732.79s -> 13751.43s]  a long time though, right? If I were to take a guess. All right. What is this? Thanks for stopping
[13751.43s -> 13756.47s]  by. The brothers of Theta appreciate. The brothers of Theta better. If you do not take damage in the
[13756.47s -> 13761.43s]  next 10 minutes, we will take 200 million off the deck. So what's the problem? Okay.
[13762.47s -> 13767.29s]  Beat our step team. Now they think they hot shit. We need someone to knock them down to pay.
[13767.29s -> 13771.29s]  You got anything I can use. So they know you sent the message this year. We bought a flame suit for
[13771.29s -> 13777.29s]  pledge hazing. You think you can find a way to cares about the debt anymore. An old meme. Oh,
[13777.29s -> 13786.82s]  you know what I got? I got almonds right here. Let's go for it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Those are
[13786.82s -> 13806.66s]  crunchy. Yep. I have to be careful because these have like wasabi and soy sauce on them, which means
[13808.52s -> 13813.32s]  you literally can't pick them up with your fucking hands. Like every other goddamn snack that prides
[13813.32s -> 13819.85s]  itself on having a bunch of shit all over it that gets all over you. Oh dude, you got to eat
[13819.85s -> 13825.59s]  Takis. Dude, they're the best. They're so good. No, fuck those things. You can't eat them. You cannot
[13825.59s -> 13832.86s]  eat Takis unless you use a fork or chopsticks or something. Why is there so much shit all of them?
[13832.86s -> 13844.90s]  Dude, just eat chopsticks. What if I don't have a pair of chopsticks with me? Am I just going to
[13844.90s -> 13856.73s]  carry chopsticks with me everywhere? Takis are one of the... Okay, seriously. If you... I put a tier
[13856.73s -> 13864.68s]  list of snacks in a place where if I eat one of them, I have to wash my hands. Like if you pick
[13864.68s -> 13870.04s]  up one Taki with your fingers, you have to wash your hands. I don't know. Fuck, they give me some
[13870.04s -> 13880.17s]  almonds. Baked Lay's don't do that. Baked Lay's are the best complete S++ tier snack. They're the
[13880.17s -> 13892.33s]  best. I don't have to do that with Baked Lay's. You know, they did a study where they took a bunch
[13892.33s -> 13897.22s]  of people and they did an IQ test to them. And they... I think the study was somewhere in
[13897.54s -> 13901.38s]  California. It had like 500 people in it. And they did an IQ test with everybody.
[13901.94s -> 13908.38s]  And then they asked what their favorite snack was. And most of the people that had over 120 IQ,
[13909.02s -> 13916.41s]  Baked Lay's were a top three in the rankings. It was maybe somewhere in California. It was
[13916.41s -> 13924.52s]  one of the LA institutes. Which is like, it's kind of interesting to think about that.
[13924.52s -> 13937.72s]  It's not real study. What are you talking about? Okay, let's go. Race to the finish for
[13938.28s -> 13947.14s]  cash and respect. I believe you. Yeah, why wouldn't you? Okay, bonus seconds earned from ramming
[13947.14s -> 13953.50s]  people and cars. Well, that's easy. I do that without trying anyways. Three, two, one.
[13967.46s -> 13977.56s]  This is fucked up. No, the study was a completely peer-reviewed independent third-party study.
[13978.28s -> 14006.68s]  I'm not running over enough people. Or cars for that matter. I didn't have to do anything. Oh!
[14007.32s -> 14028.07s]  How did that not hit everybody? There was a study in 2017 that did an IQ test on 5,000 people.
[14028.07s -> 14031.43s]  Then they asked them who their favorite Twitch streamer was. And anyone with under 70 IQ said
[14031.43s -> 14038.06s]  it was you. IQ doesn't fucking even matter. It's like a completely stupid outdated thing to have.
[14038.94s -> 14046.46s]  So whatever you say, who cares? That was fucking cool, but it didn't do anything for me.
[14046.46s -> 14053.85s]  Please just hit the dumb. There's too much smoke on the screen. I can't see anything.
[14065.30s -> 14068.82s]  But isn't it kind of weird though that when I'm walking around town and walking around the city,
[14068.82s -> 14075.54s]  I see these businessmen walking around with suits on. They're on the phone. I see doctors
[14075.54s -> 14079.78s]  walking around with stethoscopes around their necks walking around talking on the phone and stuff.
[14079.78s -> 14085.30s]  And they have like a bag of baked lays in their other hand. That's so surprising apparently.
[14086.18s -> 14119.58s]  Is it? Business man does not equal intelligence. What are you talking about? That guy has a tie-on.
[14119.58s -> 14126.90s]  I trust him. I feel like that's something Peter Griffin would say. I'm sorry.
[14130.74s -> 14140.09s]  All right, I got money. Let's use it. No, he had a tie-on, Loish. I trust him.
[14140.73s -> 14152.30s]  Do you guys remember? I completely forgot about this. Do you remember when I did like the
[14152.30s -> 14157.26s]  do the entire family guy thing with like the weird family guy piano thing in the background?
[14158.76s -> 14167.86s]  That I deleted that from my memory. I don't remember even what was happening.
[14168.60s -> 14180.18s]  What was I was I was reading like a script or something, right? Oh, I was reading
[14180.18s -> 14195.90s]  Germacraft as the different characters. Right. That was so fucking weird. I tried to do it with
[14195.90s -> 14210.94s]  every character. Oh, come on. I was at work laughing during that. Hopefully I didn't get
[14210.94s -> 14227.11s]  any in trouble. That was traumatizing. Now you have to do it as the Attack on Titan character.
[14228.44s -> 14230.92s]  What was like Attack on Titan music playing in the background?
[14239.51s -> 14245.32s]  Uh, I don't know about that. I'm not so sure about that. What does this want me to do?
[14251.74s -> 14258.82s]  Why does it want me to go down here? GPS is so fucked up right now. What?
[14260.81s -> 14274.15s]  It's just go in the ocean and swim there. What? That very clearly was go down the staircase.
[14279.24s -> 14286.89s]  It really was. You saw it wrap around the staircase. I'm not crazy. I followed it because
[14286.89s -> 14298.09s]  I don't know what is there's such a red marker over there. Oh my fucking God. Jeremy, please.
[14301.02s -> 14315.59s]  Look, it's on the staircase. There's not even a road here. What the fuck? They did this on the
[14315.59s -> 14332.78s]  office. I've never seen the office. Why is the character dressed as the guy from Happy Wheels?
[14347.30s -> 14354.82s]  This GPS is fucked. What is it talking about? Why does it want me to do this? I don't understand.
[14357.30s -> 14376.01s]  I'm just going to go this way. This doesn't make any sense. Dude, somebody's fucking with
[14376.01s -> 14382.18s]  me right now. The game is just messing with my head. What is this? Where is this telling me to
[14382.18s -> 14393.64s]  go? I'm going around in a circle. I'm just walking. This is where I wanted to go. It was here,
[14393.64s -> 14425.10s]  right? Where's the hamburger place? Yeah, it's the mall. Okay. I was right. Nobody here. All
[14425.10s -> 14437.50s]  right. So you said I could rob this place. Let me buy something first. I need some new clothes.
[14437.50s -> 14446.98s]  Game crashed. No. When was the last time I saved it? Shit. I think it was not that far away. I
[14446.98s -> 14472.26s]  wasn't in a mission or anything. God damn it. Why? I need the music again. Yeah, that's right here.
[14472.26s -> 14481.93s]  All right. We're good. You said you saved? I did. No, yeah. Six thousand. Yeah, this is fine.
[14483.00s -> 14491.56s]  I'm going to do this mission here. Either Ronin. What should I do? Does it matter? Ronin? Ronin's
[14491.56s -> 14502.20s]  the one with the bikes and the katanas. Let's see. I'm curious. What's up with the dollhouse?
[14502.20s -> 14508.92s]  Dollhouse my ass. This is how we're going to fuck up the Ronin. This'll be good. Trust me.
[14508.92s -> 14514.52s]  It is. The Ronin have a stake in Poseidon's palace. So I figure hitting their biggest money maker is
[14514.52s -> 14519.00s]  a good way to show them we're not fucking around. Okay. So what's the plan? You and I enter the
[14519.00s -> 14523.64s]  casino here. Once inside, we need to distract this security guard. I was thinking you could catch
[14523.64s -> 14528.60s]  me cheating or some shit like that. Anyway, while the guard's concerned with throwing me out, Gato
[14528.60s -> 14533.48s]  sneak in through this security door. Don't worry. I already got today's passcode from the blackjack
[14533.48s -> 14538.76s]  dealer Shandi's fucking. Now once inside, Gato had to sneak past the guards to cut the power.
[14538.76s -> 14543.32s]  And when that happens, we only have about 45 seconds before the backup generator turns on.
[14543.88s -> 14550.84s]  During the blackout though. He's eating Takis. No. But what if we just start here,
[14550.84s -> 14554.76s]  walk into the casino and just shoot all the motherfuckers that are between us and the money.
[14554.76s -> 14559.64s]  Well, I just think of the red dust being absorbed into my intestinal tract. I don't want that to
[14559.64s -> 14566.63s]  happen. You know what I mean? If you eat like a half a bag of Takis or whatever, like heavily
[14566.63s -> 14572.07s]  red food coloring stuff, I don't like want like red, like red dust absorbed into my fucking
[14572.07s -> 14581.10s]  intestines. I don't know. It just probably fine. I don't want to do that. Don't you like think of
[14581.10s -> 14584.94s]  like just like drinking? I don't know. Okay. Let me be, let me, I gotta make this clear.
[14584.94s -> 14590.79s]  I'm not saying that this is weird or gross. I mean it, but it is. Is my health going down?
[14591.35s -> 14609.16s]  How can I become like a Redditor like you? Hmm. Well, hold on. Okay. So listen,
[14609.72s -> 14615.30s]  anything that has a heavy amount of powder or like food coloring or like food dye,
[14617.29s -> 14623.29s]  you do understand. Now this is not, this is not me making it up. This is factual information. This
[14623.29s -> 14632.98s]  is just real shit. Red food dye comes from two distinct sources. One is bugs, like crushed up
[14632.98s -> 14637.78s]  bugs. They derive it from that. And the other one, I believe now correct me if I'm wrong,
[14637.78s -> 14652.58s]  is like petroleum. It's like from like gasoline or something. Isn't it? It's like a chemical they pull
[14652.58s -> 14662.65s]  out of it. So I'm telling you, I prefer the bugs. I would rather eat the bugs. I'd rather eat like
[14662.65s -> 14678.54s]  the red food coloring bugs. I don't want the other one. It's a, it's a petroleum byproduct.
[14678.54s -> 14685.82s]  Right. Okay. So if I have an opportunity to eat the bugs or the petroleum byproduct,
[14686.54s -> 14708.20s]  which one are you going to pick? Correct answer is grow your own food. God. Oh shit. I wasn't
[14708.20s -> 14723.72s]  looking. Bugs are a different byproduct. Oh my God. I've hit every car. Okay. But I don't know. I
[14723.72s -> 14730.28s]  just, I just feel something is so unnatural about, I know people love like flaming hot Cheetos and
[14730.28s -> 14736.12s]  stuff, but man, like I know there's like the blue Takis and shit. Why? Like, oh, I want the bright
[14736.12s -> 14745.74s]  blue fucking ecto cooler Takis. What's going on here? The Nelth flavoring is squeezed from a
[14745.74s -> 14754.23s]  beaver's anus. God, if you get like real for now, like a vanilla fucking plant, whatever it is,
[14754.23s -> 14758.78s]  what is vanilla? It's like a plant. It's a herb, but what is vanilla? It's a, it's a plant.
[14759.80s -> 14771.10s]  Oh shit. I just think I didn't know. It's a bean. Yeah. We just walk. What do we do here?
[14771.74s -> 14785.06s]  Take out. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to be like the old like person at the casino.
[14805.83s -> 14834.42s]  Can I play? Can I play? What? I can't play. What the fuck did I just, what's going on?
[14838.38s -> 14844.84s]  It's the guy from casino. Get out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out.
[14847.37s -> 14852.25s]  I get shocked so many times. What the fuck are you doing, dude? I don't want to, this, this,
[14853.13s -> 14884.34s]  Oh, I already got pasta. I don't want to shoot. Oh, they're up top.
[14888.01s -> 14899.93s]  Pasta. Italiano garden. Ooh. Well, he uses the, what? Oh my goodness. That hurts.
[14918.02s -> 14925.26s]  Oh, well, Larry, Larry, David. Oh, I love doing the Larry, David. I can do it really well.
[14925.98s -> 14943.82s]  You're taking a long time to do this. Hurry up. No, that was Jeff. Oh, what do you mean?
[14944.54s -> 14946.14s]  They both did the same thing. They both do that.
[14951.29s -> 14961.50s]  When are you going to put Christmas music on? We already did the Christmas music thing.
[14962.30s -> 14974.66s]  You get out of here with your fucking unbrushed teeth. You fucking idiot. All right. Should I
[14974.66s -> 14994.60s]  do a Kirby enthusiasm tier list? Cause, cause Susie's up at like S tier. We good? Um,
[14995.32s -> 15000.71s]  are we dead? Why does everything need a tier list? Because I'm, I don't know. I'm
[15001.51s -> 15019.37s]  trying to make the zoomers think I'm cool. Well, they call the cops. Big surprise there.
[15020.09s -> 15033.24s]  I already think you're cool. Oh, thanks. I don't have to try anymore. One of my favorite curb.
[15033.24s -> 15037.42s]  I'm watching the current season, right? One of my favorite jokes this season. If you haven't seen
[15037.42s -> 15043.16s]  it, but you know, spoilers hold yours close for a second. Uh, when they're talking about cheese
[15043.16s -> 15049.00s]  and they're talking about feta cheese and Leon's like, I don't even think mice like that shit.
[15049.72s -> 15053.24s]  He's like, you gotta be in a specific mood for cheese. And I don't think even mice like that
[15053.24s -> 15075.90s]  shit. The way it's delivery is fucking hilarious. Leon is, is absolutely S tier as well. Every
[15075.90s -> 15098.07s]  single thing that Leon says is just as hysterical. Are they going to leave us alone? Um, the person
[15098.15s -> 15108.73s]  sneaking back onto the car. Stop tearing shit. It's cringe. All right. I won't.
[15114.49s -> 15118.49s]  Don't question me. And we're in America. Speak English.
[15125.77s -> 15129.61s]  A little jumpy today. He's knocking on the door.
[15129.61s -> 15154.15s]  Over there. So rude. Sword. Listen, I know you're having a hard time adjusting to the way I run
[15154.15s -> 15163.27s]  things here. How about you let me deal with my father and you call whatever the fuck I tell you
[15163.27s -> 15192.07s]  to deal with. Um, of course. Excellent. Okay. All right. Ooh, $500 a day. All right. You guys said
[15192.07s -> 15194.79s]  that the Ronin missions are the best ones. Should I just do another one? Oh, I don't have enough
[15194.79s -> 15214.28s]  respect. What's your favorite curb episode? The entirety of season seven, which I mean, I count
[15214.28s -> 15218.95s]  that as one episode because I watched the whole season back to back. So I usually watch that in
[15218.95s -> 15243.42s]  one or two sittings. If I ever go back and rewatch, you can gamble in the casino. Really? Where is it?
[15243.42s -> 15254.36s]  Yes, you can. Is it just the Ronin stronghold? Don't tell him that. Who told him? Where is it?
[15254.36s -> 15275.11s]  It's not on the map. Really? Um, where is it? I want to go to it. Do you like Seinfeld?
[15275.91s -> 15280.39s]  I mean, I like Seinfeld. I think was our it was good. There's a lot of really like classic
[15280.39s -> 15284.79s]  episodes. But I think curb is funnier than Seinfeld. Somebody just wanted to punch me
[15284.79s -> 15298.87s]  in the face probably. But I think it's like a more fun show to me. I don't think it's by a whole lot.
[15300.33s -> 15307.51s]  It's not astronomically better. But I think it's I laughed more times at curb than I did at Seinfeld.
[15315.24s -> 15319.13s]  And you know, I have to be really, really honest with you guys. It's the laugh track.
[15321.16s -> 15325.00s]  I can't I can't take any show seriously with a laugh track. I just I just it ruins it.
[15325.64s -> 15348.89s]  Where's this casino? You guys are actually not going to tell me where it is. I'll find it.
[15350.38s -> 15358.92s]  Sidon's palace that on here. Oh, whatever. I don't care. I'm going to go do this mission down here.
[15359.48s -> 15388.58s]  The laugh track on the stream. No, not that one. Fucking God, I don't even want to be doing this.
[15392.26s -> 15395.46s]  I can't have a laugh track. I need to like cue it up and record it and stuff.
[15400.26s -> 15407.67s]  Um, yeah, and you can't just remove a laugh track either. Like, oh, what if they did a thing where
[15407.67s -> 15412.79s]  they remastered some of these old shows? It's like the weird awkward pauses that a lot of these shows
[15412.79s -> 15419.13s]  do when there's laughing. Kind of like when any celebrity doesn't matter how big or small they are
[15419.13s -> 15424.10s]  shows up on SNL, they walk onto the stage. And there's just the clapping and cheering while they
[15424.10s -> 15431.86s]  just go. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Yeah. And everybody just sits there and stares at nothing for like
[15431.86s -> 15455.05s]  20 to 30 straight seconds. It kind of takes me away. I didn't whose door is this? Find and take
[15455.05s -> 15461.62s]  out the individual listed on the hit list. Okay. Use the dossier to figure out how to find the
[15461.62s -> 15468.55s]  target. Then use your minimap to track and kill them. Listen up. Got some people that need to be
[15468.55s -> 15475.43s]  taken care of. You take them out and there's something in it for you. Okay. And then there's
[15475.43s -> 15488.41s]  a security guard for the trailer park. Okay. Orderly the downtown hospital is a lifetime
[15488.41s -> 15499.91s]  skeeters fan. Um, okay, we're going after the mascot. Buy one of each item from the the freckle
[15499.91s -> 15507.51s]  bitches menu and he'll show up to try and sell you on some franchise opportunity. I need to
[15507.51s -> 15528.98s]  pick up King's book. Okay. So we're gonna go get this guy. This is it. Where's this taking me?
[15528.98s -> 15538.65s]  Where is freckled bitches? Oh, right here. Okay. So order everything on the menu.
[15539.37s -> 15594.38s]  I got it. All right. Order one of each thing on the menu. Wait, it's a drive through order
[15594.38s -> 15616.84s]  one of everything. This is expensive. Okay. I ordered everything. Where is he? Because he shows
[15616.84s -> 15643.45s]  up. Oh, there he is. I thought they just fucking ran him over. Um, what? How do they know it's me?
[15643.53s -> 15664.65s]  How do they know it's I'm doing anything bad? You stupid game. What's this music place? Wait,
[15664.65s -> 15674.55s]  can I buy instruments? Oh my God. Can I buy instruments? Music stores. They sell songs.
[15674.55s -> 15695.62s]  Oh, nevermind. Well, can't listen to any of these. Casino is in the hotels in Marina district,
[15695.62s -> 15726.41s]  middle top island, middle top island. Oh shit. Look at that. Somebody said, sorry guys.
[15727.61s -> 15733.21s]  I'm going to turn this 10 grand into 50 grand and I'm buying one of those cool cars.
[15733.77s -> 15759.74s]  I can't be trusted. Play some Kevin. Oh, you know what I watched? And I could not believe what I
[15759.74s -> 15766.74s]  was watching. I watched home sweet home alone. Like the home alone sort of like sequel-y,
[15766.74s -> 15776.86s]  reboot-y, sequel-y thing. Um, the movie was awful. That whole movie, the whole point of
[15776.86s -> 15780.06s]  home alone was, look it, we're going to set up a bunch of like crazy things that happen in a house
[15780.06s -> 15785.98s]  and it's like traps and stuff. The first hour of that movie was just kind of like a,
[15785.98s -> 15789.02s]  a Will Ferrell movie where they didn't have Will Ferrell as the main character
[15789.90s -> 15802.50s]  and nothing happens for like an hour and 15 minutes. That's the first movie too.
[15804.15s -> 15812.52s]  Whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute here. The first home alone was a godly tier higher than that.
[15812.52s -> 15821.67s]  And where is this thing taking me? Oh, oh fuck. That person is going to be so pissed.
[15822.55s -> 15825.75s]  There was somebody in the chat like 10, 20 minutes ago that said,
[15825.75s -> 15829.19s]  stop doing tear shit. It's cringe. And I'm like, all right. And then I just did it again.
[15830.07s -> 15854.47s]  Oh, it's the way point. Okay. So where's the casino? Is the mall? The left? Having opinions
[15854.47s -> 15862.62s]  is not a tier list. I know, but we've recently did the tier list. So it's like in my mind.
[15863.42s -> 15893.10s]  Is this illegal? I guess not. Not really. Blackjack. Can I play slots? Oh, you can,
[15893.10s -> 15901.16s]  you can only play blackjack or poker. All right. Blackjack. Let's go. Oh yeah. Let's go.
[15902.04s -> 15930.66s]  What's the max bet? Oh no. What's the max bet? There is no max bet. No, I didn't mean to do that.
[15930.66s -> 15935.62s]  I didn't. Holy. I meant to hit back, but the stupid, the stupid switch thing where the,
[15935.62s -> 15940.50s]  I was back is a, you know what I'm saying? I wanted to hit B. I wanted to hit B. I'm going
[15940.50s -> 15947.98s]  to win this hand, I think, but I wanted to go back because I wanted to save. Stan, please. Oh,
[15948.06s -> 15961.85s]  thank fucking God. Okay. I wanted to save it before I did this. 17 versus eight. Stay.
[15963.29s -> 15979.75s]  That's too bad. It's this one, right? Is it this one? Which one is it? I don't remember.
[15979.75s -> 16002.89s]  What are you talking about? I just saved it inside of there. It doesn't save your location.
[16002.89s -> 16011.94s]  Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm freaked out. All right. I gotta get my respect up. How do I get, I gotta
[16011.94s -> 16030.44s]  like go find like a rival gang. Are you in a rival gang? I'll be honest. When we were walking
[16030.44s -> 16033.16s]  behind this guy, I thought he had like a, I thought he had like a rooster mask on.
[16033.72s -> 16059.96s]  It doesn't give me respect. Now he wants to fight. Okay. How much is in this can? How much is in the
[16059.96s -> 16078.50s]  can? He was faking it. He was faking it. I don't have any bullets. Do I get respect for that?
[16079.14s -> 16105.70s]  I don't need very much respect. Wait. Okay. Here we go. That wasn't enough. I'm going to go do
[16105.70s -> 16121.94s]  whatever this is. That's police activity. That's not respect. No, but the bar on the top right,
[16121.94s -> 16145.42s]  the purple one. You can surf a car. Can you really do a handstand? That's so stupid. Oh,
[16145.42s -> 16152.28s]  no. Oh, God. That person's going to fly off the cliff. Oh, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
[16152.28s -> 16162.04s]  Stop, stop. Holy shit. I'm going to just get, I'm going to do that again. Oh my God, dude.
[16162.04s -> 16193.03s]  Go get your car cleaned. What if he gets in an accident? Holy shit. Come on. Stay in it. Oh my
[16193.03s -> 16199.46s]  God. How much respect. This would be the most watched fucking TikTok video ever. How do I not
[16199.46s -> 16217.27s]  have the respect of the whole world right now? Who's screaming? Is the guy in the car? Drive.
[16217.27s -> 16243.40s]  Come on. We need the views. I've been doing this for so long. Oh fuck. That was close. Dude,
[16243.40s -> 16255.21s]  give me the respect for the love of God. Why is it taking so long? Okay. I did it. I did it. I did
[16255.21s -> 16286.02s]  it. Oh my God. He's gone crazy. How much respect did I even get for that? I do it again. Oh shit.
[16286.02s -> 16307.46s]  Okay. Ambulance mission. Let's go. I hit right bumper to do handbrake. I'm sorry.
[16308.18s -> 16329.94s]  It's my fault. That's my fault. I'll take that. What do I do? Move up and down to provide CPR.
[16329.94s -> 16350.94s]  Um, hello? Oh my God. No. How do I do it? Why won't this work? I can't fucking see now. Thanks.
[16350.94s -> 16377.13s]  Do you see that I'm trying to help somebody? Got him. Okay. That guy has the same truck.
[16377.77s -> 16392.33s]  Go run him over immediately. No, I'm trying to get respect. All right. What's going on here?
[16392.33s -> 16446.39s]  What do I do with these? Oh, I have the shock pads. Are you serious? Oh my God. Okay. Let's go.
[16446.39s -> 16470.31s]  Let's go. Hurry up. I'm on level three right now. Get out of the way. All right. You need to be.
[16470.31s -> 16510.76s]  All right. Here we go. Got it. I'm getting money for this. Holy shit. This is actually kind of good.
[16510.76s -> 16517.08s]  SpongeBob scream. What I keep hearing is I keep hearing every flash game scream. It's that one
[16517.08s -> 16548.02s]  that goes like hurry up. Come on. Police. What? Why is everybody freaking out? They don't think
[16548.02s -> 16571.56s]  I'm supposed to be here or something. First thing's going to run over level five. Let's go. Good call.
[16571.56s -> 16620.26s]  What's the max level of really itchy? I six. I'll get there. I work quick. Go to the casino. I'm
[16620.26s -> 16641.59s]  working on it. I need money to go to the casino. Don't you understand? And I'm going to get trapped
[16641.59s -> 16693.74s]  there. I can't go there. Oh shit. Easy. Come on. Do it. This person's. Wait, what? I can't bring
[16693.74s -> 16716.58s]  the person back to life. Level seven. Go to the casino. Don't worry. I will. Where is this up top?
[16716.58s -> 16731.59s]  First on the train tracks. EMT has 10. Okay. Well, I'm almost there. What's this like movie star one?
[16731.59s -> 16753.99s]  Dude, what is in the way? I thought the person was going to punch me. That's not what I wanted.
[16753.99s -> 16775.99s]  One more. Good. A thousand bucks. This is better than doing any missions. This is not the ambulance.
[16775.99s -> 16786.39s]  I thought this was the ambulance. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. You're not getting any respect. I'm
[16786.39s -> 16792.06s]  getting a lot of money. Look, it's white and red. It was an easy mistake and has a huge back.
[16792.06s -> 16847.30s]  Are you high? No, bro. Are you? Do not run those people over. I can't light on fire, right? Come
[16847.30s -> 16870.36s]  on. There's only one more. I got five minutes to do this shit. I'll go this way. How come the number
[16870.36s -> 16878.82s]  of victims is increasing, but you don't have to save them? That's a good question. Nothing's wrong
[16878.82s -> 16886.30s]  with the car. It's dragging on the ground. Something's wrong with the back left tire.
[16893.59s -> 16940.39s]  Are you serious? Okay. Oh no. I'm going a really dumb way. Why would you shoot at an ambulance
[16940.39s -> 16948.15s]  here? Come on. Stop it. I'm being followed. Oh fuck. I'm being followed. No, not anymore.
[16948.87s -> 16960.58s]  Oh, hold on. Let me take care of you. Where are you? Where'd she go? Oh, okay. She's in the back.
[16962.90s -> 16972.09s]  Okay. Well, I'll just bring her to the hospital. That's fine. This thing is smoking though. I have
[16972.09s -> 16993.88s]  to be careful. There's only one more level after this. I can't screw this up. She's not even on
[16993.88s -> 17003.50s]  like a gurney or anything. Oh no. Oh no. Excuse me. They know she's in here. Oh, come on. Oh no.
[17004.22s -> 17065.86s]  This is bad. I don't have time for this shit. Fucking die. What? I did it to the car? I feel
[17065.86s -> 17071.37s]  like I'm making a specific YouTube video and like a first person shooter. Like only using the one
[17071.37s -> 17080.36s]  item that's like really hard to use. It's like a side item. And why would you ever use it? Oh my
[17080.36s -> 17098.54s]  God. I saw headlights. You. I've had enough of this shit. Move. Oh man. This thing is beat the
[17098.54s -> 17105.16s]  fuck up bad. This is bad. This is going to be horrible. Is she still in the car? Is that the
[17105.16s -> 17112.62s]  problem? This is not good. I have to take care of this now. I have to take care of this right now.
[17113.18s -> 17126.38s]  Come on. There's police here now. Were you helping me? I can't tell. I don't know.
[17130.14s -> 17136.06s]  Get away from me. They just don't stop. This is far cry. What's happening? No, my ambulance.
[17136.62s -> 17164.98s]  I need that. Game crashed. Fuck. No. Oh, all that money gone. Is there a quick save button?
[17164.98s -> 17173.06s]  I can't just like save it in the middle of every single thing. Every 15 seconds.
[17173.06s -> 17184.04s]  Oh, that's sad. Getting into the car animation crashed it. It may have auto saved. Ooh. Damn it.
[17184.04s -> 17187.88s]  Please tell me there was an auto save after I completed that. Come on. Please.
[17190.28s -> 17206.38s]  I don't think so. That's very sad. It's very sad. All right. Well, we're going to have to do the
[17206.38s -> 17212.09s]  thing where every five minutes you guys freak out and spam spam. This sucks. I had like 15 grand.
[17212.65s -> 17221.72s]  Damn it. I blame the like far cry six bullshit where it's just the enemies just spawn a never
[17221.72s -> 17228.22s]  ending on top of you. I need respect and I need to get I'm going to get it somehow. What is this?
[17229.80s -> 17251.74s]  Septic Avenger. I'm kind of I'm curious. I'm curious. This game is a lot of fun though. All
[17251.74s -> 17255.99s]  right. I'm going to take a quick poll in the chat. Do you want to see this again?
[17256.89s -> 17265.61s]  But I continue the playthrough of Saints Row 2. Is having a good time? I'm having a good time.
[17265.61s -> 17278.79s]  I think I'll do it again. So I got the community kind of gentleman of the row mod. Let's do a lot
[17278.79s -> 17283.16s]  of bug fixes and help with a lot of stuff. Is there anything else I should get to help make
[17283.16s -> 17289.56s]  this more stable? Listen, we have to make this quick. What do you think? Stefan is having another
[17289.56s -> 17295.48s]  one of this war race today. And I'm not his pool boy this year. Here's a few things. Okay.
[17295.48s -> 17299.40s]  I've been trying to sell real estate in this area for a month, but no one's buying because
[17299.40s -> 17305.72s]  the property value is too high. What do you want me to do about it? My cousin runs a septic company.
[17305.72s -> 17309.08s]  I figured you could borrow one of his trucks. There's nothing more than GOTR right now.
[17310.10s -> 17314.07s]  You know, you really think people are going to want to buy elections making an official patch
[17314.07s -> 17317.43s]  to fix it. It's really hard to find cheap housing and still what was what did you say?
[17318.15s -> 17328.90s]  Spray sewage all over your targets. What the fuck? Builder has exclusive rights to new homes
[17328.90s -> 17333.94s]  in Cuenbeca and new Henkei. Use space to stop the truck construction sites of business.
[17333.94s -> 17344.92s]  Oh my god, this is ridiculous. Those construction workers have a sense of humor.
[17346.28s -> 17352.87s]  Does it have to do damage? Safety rating on this thing. Why are the cops here?
[17353.83s -> 17380.90s]  This thing. Did I use all the. Oh, I have to wait. We haven't fun yet. Okay. You feel something.
[17381.06s -> 17387.35s]  Spraying somebody's house is a shit. I think my house looks shitty anyway.
[17391.37s -> 17404.54s]  This is disgusting. I wonder if they dented the truck picture of the grill for insurance.
[17406.31s -> 17416.89s]  This is shocking. Does it just stop after we get through? Okay. How much they're willing to
[17416.89s -> 17427.64s]  pay for that property now? Okay. Now we get a spray over here. Lesson to be learned here.
[17427.64s -> 17436.50s]  Don't stand in the way of a septic truck. You love this guy. That person went nuts.
[17437.06s -> 17453.83s]  Asshole. Power washing. I wish I could see the homeowner's face.
[17458.42s -> 17474.33s]  Code it. Hey, not that much more. There's no timer either. Wait, did I fail? What? Oh, come on.
[17474.97s -> 17485.42s]  There is a timer. Oh, what the fuck? Why didn't I. There has exclusive rights to new homes in
[17485.42s -> 17494.09s]  Cuenbeca and new Henkei. Let's pay their construction sites of business. Oh, that ought to make Javier
[17494.09s -> 17516.41s]  happy. I just didn't understand what was going on. How much they're willing to pay for that property
[17516.41s -> 17523.00s]  now? There's a route meter. You have to do it all before the route ends. Ah, okay. So that's the
[17523.00s -> 17532.31s]  time. I thought that was me increasing the amount of damage. I think I'm way ahead. It couldn't
[17532.31s -> 17559.08s]  break. It would have been unsafe. I just made that house. I wish I could see the homeowner's face.
[17559.08s -> 17566.31s]  The cars are almost worth doing more than the buildings. It would have taken too much time.
[17566.31s -> 17575.30s]  Reload it. What the fuck? Construction workers have a sense of humor. This hit and run thing
[17575.30s -> 17582.54s]  really does get easier the more you do it. All right, I'll get there. You okay, buddy?
[17582.54s -> 17591.74s]  You still pull this off, right? Is that reaching? It's not. Oh, I can't reach across the street with
[17591.74s -> 17597.02s]  this shit. Come on. Some people are just inconsiderate drivers, you know? All right, I got it. There we go.
[17598.44s -> 17601.48s]  All right, so what were you saying? They said they were making a patch for this game
[17602.04s -> 17607.56s]  like 10 years later. That's crazy. There we go. Now I can do the mission.
[17610.84s -> 17622.10s]  The developer making the patch recently died of cancer. Oh my God. That's terrible.
[17627.70s -> 17635.19s]  That's awful. Well, this is really cool. This was like really, really fun. That's very saddening.
[17640.95s -> 17643.03s]  Were they working on the patch too, like officially?
[17654.46s -> 17657.74s]  Well, this is really, really cool. And the fact that somebody was like, put this together.
[17661.82s -> 17674.36s]  That's really sad, though. He was the sole reason why they started patching the game.
[17674.36s -> 17695.10s]  Wow. It's still being worked on. Yeah, that is really sad because this is really cool.
[17695.10s -> 17698.84s]  And it's just like, it makes me hear about kind of stuff like that. It just,
[17700.63s -> 17704.71s]  I'm sitting here thinking like, oh, wow, what an awesome mod. Oh, this is so cool. Oh, that guy.
[17707.46s -> 17709.78s]  Why the fuck do we still have to have that shit in the world still?
[17712.71s -> 17720.44s]  Slow us down. This is just sober. It just angers me that like this cancer still is a fucking thing.
[17721.40s -> 17726.22s]  I really hope that whenever hundreds of years from now, maybe even less than that,
[17727.02s -> 17740.97s]  this shit is just gone. And it's just very easy to get rid of. You hope that it's sooner than that.
[17740.97s -> 17752.55s]  Much sooner. There's so much new shit that these medical companies are working on now.
[17753.51s -> 17756.63s]  Yeah, you got to hope that some of this stuff actually plays out.
[17762.70s -> 17783.43s]  I didn't do it. They did. They have the game. I will. I did. I wanted the extra respect.
[17784.50s -> 17791.46s]  All right, let's do it. I can finally do that Ronin mission, right?
[17793.94s -> 17811.67s]  I thought that was a spider. It's not. In fact, I don't know what the hell this thing is.
[17812.39s -> 17823.85s]  Pick up the stop sign. It said I could. Pick it up. I want to pick it up. Cool.
[17824.49s -> 17849.42s]  I just want to test the range. All right. Well, I've launched them. All right. Where do I?
[17849.42s -> 17868.17s]  Where am I going? That way? I need a car. Save. I got it. I saved it. This is very suspicious.
[17868.17s -> 17891.02s]  Why is there an indicator over here? On this roof? When you wash in the shower,
[17891.02s -> 17895.42s]  do you let the water run down your legs soapy or do you actually wash with your hands?
[17896.66s -> 17907.83s]  I rub my hands all over my legs. Most of the soap is so when I lather up, you get like a little bit
[17907.83s -> 17913.21s]  of the squeeze, get it in your hands. Most of it goes on the crotch, right? You just like get it
[17913.21s -> 17917.45s]  all over the crotch, all over like your balls and shit. And then like it really lathers up down there
[17917.45s -> 17930.25s]  and then it goes everywhere else from there. That's the central point outward. If you're
[17930.25s -> 17935.37s]  lathering and you're starting at chest or legs or baton, no, no, no, no. That's the central
[17935.37s -> 17942.01s]  location that can go up. There's an equal distance from like your crotch to everywhere else.
[17942.17s -> 17975.74s]  Arrest that guy. Arrest him. Jesus. All right. Arrest him. Do they cuff people that aren't
[17975.74s -> 17979.96s]  a playable character? Why is there another crew? Is there another? Oh, there's another.
[17979.96s -> 18012.52s]  I thought he shot at the other cop. Whoa. I can't get on the roof. All right. Get me out of here.
[18012.52s -> 18029.42s]  I'm stuck in this area. Get me out of here. What the fuck? Your crosshair was right on him. Yeah,
[18029.42s -> 18037.90s]  I know. It's a joke. What in God's name are you playing as? This is just the character in the
[18037.90s -> 18040.86s]  game. You don't remember. You had like nostalgic glasses on. You don't remember. This is what the
[18040.86s -> 18051.02s]  character looks like. This is what the main character looks like. All right. This is like
[18051.02s -> 18071.83s]  just like a battle going on out here. You suck. You are terrible. I need a car. Okay. I actually
[18071.83s -> 18084.50s]  need a car. Please give me a car. This is getting ridiculous. All right. Now you pissed me off.
[18117.94s -> 18127.45s]  Press R1 to drift. What was that noise? How's my chair? I turned my chair a little bit and it has
[18127.45s -> 18161.80s]  like a squeaky wheel. Don't you see that you don't take a turn if somebody's driving straight.
[18161.80s -> 18175.29s]  Nothing was squeaky about that. Don't change the subject. I'll listen to it. All right. Now
[18175.29s -> 18191.72s]  you pissed me off. I leaned back in the chair and it's the lumbar support goes back and it's
[18191.72s -> 18198.33s]  really, really it needs like WD-40. You guys are just over fucking reacting as usual, right?
[18198.33s -> 18238.95s]  It's okay though. Twitch chat, right? He's a liar. Maybe. Let's go. Technically,
[18238.95s -> 18243.11s]  legal called me up and said that a Ronan bachelor party was getting too touchy feely.
[18243.11s -> 18247.67s]  The bounces have all been paid not to do dick. So if anyone is going to teach those assholes a
[18247.67s -> 18256.57s]  lesson, it's going to have to be you. Okay. Oh, I'm here. All right. I don't have any weapons.
[18257.93s -> 18277.96s]  I have pepper spray and some pistol ammo. I don't know. Can I even do this? I don't think I even
[18278.60s -> 18304.09s]  give you the ATM. Can I pick up the ATM? I only have. Oh, I have plenty of shots. All right. Who's
[18304.09s -> 18330.79s]  bad in here? I assure you I'm holding left. Oh, fuck. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[18331.35s -> 18334.47s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[18335.03s -> 18341.90s]  Watch out. What am I fucking firing at, dude? Why is it hitting the wall? You piece of shit.
[18341.90s -> 18386.86s]  I can't believe you shot that person. Wait a second. What are you doing? You don't. Oh, well.
[18389.08s -> 18395.42s]  I guess that did not register that was happening when I first got in here.
[18404.04s -> 18417.06s]  He paid. I paid for a lap dance. So I'm going to get a lap dance. Hey, didn't expect to see me
[18417.06s -> 18457.19s]  here, did you? Freeze. That's a TV. Freeze. Oh, no. All right. Freeze, scumbag. Oh, no. No,
[18457.19s -> 18462.63s]  don't. Don't make me do this. Don't make me do this. That guy. That guy was a super powered
[18462.63s -> 18483.00s]  person. Hands in the air, scumbag. Get over here. Get over here. Why can't I not grab you?
[18483.48s -> 18517.43s]  You all right? Oh, this is not good. I'm so sorry, but I have to do this.
[18521.88s -> 18528.49s]  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't really. I don't want. I can't even pick this
[18528.49s -> 18541.40s]  person up. Oh, my God. No. God damn it. I was trying to throw you out here. You've ruined
[18541.40s -> 18562.71s]  everything. The game got stuck. You didn't think I was going to be fucking this small, did you?
[18562.71s -> 18586.17s]  You didn't think I was this small for that. Dude, really? Honest to God. Hold on. This is very
[18586.17s -> 18602.81s]  important. I'm trying to shoot him in the finger, just like in the finger. I just need. No, it
[18602.81s -> 18623.45s]  doesn't. They can't even be interacted with. Oh, no. I'm supposed to go to the roof. Stay where you
[18623.45s -> 18654.92s]  are. All NPCs don't move. Room back to A. Wait, did I go in here yet? Stairs. I got to get to the
[18654.92s -> 18671.56s]  roof. All right. Take him up from up here. Oh, a CD. How am I supposed to do this? CDs. Just shoot
[18671.56s -> 18688.46s]  them from. I don't know. I have a pistol. Is there a weapon up here I can get? Oh, my fucking God.
[18688.46s -> 18718.54s]  That hurts. Ouch. First try to talk to me. That was weird. Oh, you have a hostage. I'm really glad
[18718.54s -> 18728.70s]  I actually didn't shoot you. I can't hit them. They cannot be injured. Look at this. Oh, no.
[18739.85s -> 18752.98s]  Oh, cops are here. Does this count if I don't kill them? I can fall off this. I got to be careful.
[18757.32s -> 18762.60s]  Where is this person? Over there. Okay, I see. Oh, no. I'm on roller skates.
[18763.56s -> 18799.10s]  This is not the place to be on roller skates. I'm okay. Easy. Don't fall off. Oh, my goodness.
[18799.10s -> 18804.58s]  This person is so good. All jokes are writing themselves. I have not fallen off yet.
[18808.34s -> 18829.26s]  I can't even see this person. Is the tree shooting at me? I don't. Where are they?
[18829.26s -> 18856.22s]  That's it, right? Okay, I got it. Oh, don't do that. A thousand bucks. 500 bucks a day.
[18864.81s -> 18875.08s]  That's saved, right? That counts. Does that count? I got the screen, right? Okay. Good. Thank God.
[18875.08s -> 18891.30s]  Game did not crash. I'm fine. I need a little bit more respect. Let's do another race.
[18891.30s -> 18917.90s]  Let's try to get the gold medal here. It's hard to even see. I can try to screw with them.
[18919.18s -> 18932.33s]  I like to smash it on the brakes. I was trying to get somebody to fly out the windshield.
[18932.97s -> 18952.10s]  What a dummy. You're out. The person's attached to their car. I hit the rock. I'm the one person
[18952.10s -> 18996.49s]  that hits the rock. Get out of here. Excuse me. I had to kill the person back there. I should have
[18996.49s -> 19013.32s]  just killed that person and got on the road. All right. That's a gold medal. Nice. How much is that?
[19015.86s -> 19027.22s]  A thousand dollars. This person's right here. Who is this? Are they in this building in front of me?
[19027.86s -> 19042.86s]  Oh, they're in the hospital. Right. Is that person right there? Is this guy right here?
[19042.86s -> 19090.74s]  I got to get him alone, right? Shock paddles. I don't have shock paddles anymore. If I get the
[19090.74s -> 19122.52s]  plant. Take him out. Take him out. Did I get him? All right. I've had enough. He's spraying your own.
[19122.52s -> 19150.82s]  You fucking moron. Take a gun out. You fucking idiot. Like really? No. Don't you... Everybody
[19150.82s -> 19159.94s]  stay calm. That was a really bad guy. I'm an undercover agent. I'm an undercover police agent,
[19159.94s -> 19164.57s]  FBI officer. This guy was very bad. He was... I don't even know what he was doing. He was doing
[19164.57s -> 19188.73s]  something. Nobody paid me a lot of money to do that. Have a nice day. David again? What? All
[19188.73s -> 19196.15s]  right. Now... What should I do? What's this? Oh, this is for sale. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[19196.15s -> 19206.73s]  I want to spend some money. I want to get some new cool clothes. We're going to get some really like
[19206.73s -> 19214.90s]  snappy nice suits and stuff and maybe some weapons. Yeah. Brass knuckle. What's a good weapon shop?
[19214.90s -> 19231.67s]  Go to the casino. No, I'm not doing that. Go to the mall. The good clothes shop is near the bridge.
[19232.50s -> 19261.02s]  Something down here. I'll try it. Casino will sell you a suit. I don't think they have your size.
[19269.61s -> 19276.82s]  Hostage diversion? You drive at high speeds to evade the cops until your hostage breaks down
[19276.82s -> 19290.02s]  and pays you. What? There's so much shit to do in this game. I have two hostages? Drive really fast
[19290.02s -> 19323.10s]  for a minute. Where's this? I don't understand where... I want to go to the clothing store.
[19323.10s -> 19338.01s]  I don't care about that mission right now. Oh, it's because it's in the back. I think they got
[19338.01s -> 19367.19s]  away. Okay. I want to buy some nice clothes. No, I don't. I want eyes. Human eyes. Okay. Well,
[19367.19s -> 19399.48s]  I mean, I have to do that. That's so stupid. How about a knitted cap? This is not like suits.
[19399.48s -> 19416.50s]  These are different couch fabrics. Where'd you guys bring me to? Go to the suits category? Oh,
[19416.50s -> 19441.85s]  outfits. The game fucking crashed. Of course it did. He fell for it? Oh well. I don't know
[19441.85s -> 19459.43s]  what I just did. Hopefully it's the right one. 34. It's this one. Outfits always crash the game.
[19459.43s -> 19464.36s]  Suit category outright crashes your game every time when previewed. Oh well, that's good to know.
[19464.36s -> 19479.05s]  I can do the mission. For a second I didn't even know what that was on the couch. I didn't even
[19479.05s -> 19482.57s]  know it was me. I was trying to figure out what it was the first two seconds.
[19507.34s -> 19533.58s]  You're one of those deflated people from the anti-smoking ads? Musinex booger person.
[19535.69s -> 19539.51s]  Doesn't he have an English accent too? Isn't he like, oh Roy, I'm going to get under your
[19540.23s -> 19547.35s]  fucking toenails. Oh no, Musinex is there. I'm going to fuck up your lungs. Doesn't he have
[19547.35s -> 19603.62s]  a British accent? Buy an expensive car. Holy shit. Whatever. Whoa, that's cool.
[19603.62s -> 19625.80s]  Cool. How much is it? Except I only have $13,900 as a net worth total. So hopefully it's under that.
[19626.52s -> 19666.30s]  Did I buy it? I'm going a different route. See? They're coming down that road right now. Look
[19666.30s -> 19687.32s]  at that. 500 IQ play. Good stuff. Don't bait me with that bullshit. I'm not going that way.
[19688.04s -> 19715.96s]  Told you it was going to work. Eventually. Hello, I brought you a car.
[19722.33s -> 19748.57s]  The wheel's still spinning. Oh no. You idiot. You absolute idiot. And I'm talking about both
[19748.57s -> 19754.73s]  people on the screen right now. Because what that did, unfortunately, is it wedged it into the car.
[19755.37s -> 19763.48s]  I would have been able to go, but the bike is now here and that is a huge problem. This is very bad.
[19769.72s -> 19777.03s]  Hello? Settle down. All right. I got to knock that. Wait. Another one crashed. What are they doing?
[19780.26s -> 19792.73s]  Okay. You guys got to settle the fuck down. All right. I got back in the car. Good. Let's go.
[19793.53s -> 19808.94s]  Come on, dude. Why? Why did you have to do this? Get the fuck away from me, dude.
[19820.23s -> 19830.50s]  This is stuck now. I think I just made it worse somehow. How did I make this worse?
[19831.30s -> 19838.54s]  I'm like a different character that just came around. What?
[19840.14s -> 19860.23s]  Leave me alone. The game's going to crash. I know it. They're going to keep piling in here.
[19866.23s -> 19876.66s]  I can't even get up. Eventually, they'll do that enough times where I'll be able to get out of here,
[19876.66s -> 19893.30s]  I think. Can I use all their bodies and all their crushed rubble to drive over it? Oh no. I wonder
[19893.30s -> 19899.40s]  what's going to happen. I hear a motorcycle. I wonder if the motorcycle is coming this way.
[19899.40s -> 19926.70s]  Oh, that was a cop. Oh dear. How could it possibly still not be able to move?
[19926.70s -> 19949.22s]  This is not possible. Actually, it's impossible. Give me a car. Give me another car. Will you just
[19949.22s -> 19955.37s]  leave already? Get up. Can I please just get up and leave? There's no reason for you to be here.
[19955.37s -> 19963.50s]  Just get out of here. Go this way. Just go that way. I didn't even do anything illegal. Oh my god.
[19963.50s -> 19991.16s]  I did. Did I? Yes. What the fuck? There's so many motorcycles under here. It's going to be
[19991.16s -> 20013.18s]  impossible to get this to move. Idiots. This is not accomplishing anything. I'm just going to
[20013.18s -> 20030.63s]  be in... It's going to get this stuck. I need to take the L? Yeah, I think I do. Did somebody else
[20030.63s -> 20059.83s]  crash? Where did you come from? I don't know what else to do. Hold L2. Start with grenade. Nothing
[20059.83s -> 20081.98s]  is going to work. All right. Stop that. I have to restart the mission. Maybe it'll despawn. Get
[20081.98s -> 20120.14s]  out of the car. I think the wheels are touching something. The wheels are touching something.
[20120.14s -> 20142.06s]  Fuck this mission. I'll just redo it. What? Okay. Retry from... I don't know what that is. So,
[20142.06s -> 20167.85s]  I'm going to press backspace. Is it enter? Enter, right? Thank god. Let's go. I thought that was a
[20167.85s -> 20212.47s]  ramp.
[20217.83s -> 20227.54s]  Thank you. The special AR-50 fires grenades using right click. Very cool. That's really cool. What
[20227.54s -> 20254.33s]  is right click again? It's left trigger. It doesn't fail the mission, right? Don't even think about
[20254.33s -> 20305.96s]  going to that same spot. Thank god. Protect the... This blew the car up. I don't know why I did that.
[20305.96s -> 20315.00s]  I don't understand. I don't know what happened. I'm so childish. I just am fucking... I'm childish.
[20315.00s -> 20331.40s]  I'm a child and I have to agree. Jesus. You're a worse driver than I am. Look where my legs are.
[20331.40s -> 20360.12s]  My knees are so high. There's not much to protect us from. What am I protecting us from? One person?
[20360.76s -> 20374.18s]  Don't go that way. Okay. I tried to shoot the car in front of us.
[20380.23s -> 20388.07s]  We're traveling fast so it's going to go back and hit us. We drove into it. There's nothing to even
[20388.07s -> 20397.85s]  fire at so I'm just getting bored. There's nobody after us. I don't even know what they're talking
[20397.85s -> 20419.77s]  about. Oh my god. Were they all stacked in one spot? Did they all spawn there? Holy shit. Oh my
[20420.41s -> 20434.86s]  goodness. I don't think it's supposed to be like this. Jesus Christ. You think that has something
[20434.86s -> 20441.46s]  to do with the fact that they all were stuck in that little ravine and then it spawned them all
[20441.46s -> 20447.19s]  in the same place? If you crash anymore this is going to start to... It's not going to be my fault
[20447.19s -> 20455.67s]  if you do that. You crash again. This is on fire. No. It's gonna... Please be careful. We're very close.
[20459.67s -> 20479.30s]  Okay. Thank god. Remember my mom has a dog
[20479.38s -> 20490.49s]  with a sister? Shout out the dog. Shout out to your sister's dog. I think I misinterpreted that.
[20503.91s -> 20514.92s]  Somebody has an important question. How do I explain the word sus? No, that's not my thing.
[20514.92s -> 20547.46s]  Okay cool. 15 grand. Weapon time. How have I not tried to do this yet? This is incredibly
[20547.46s -> 20578.54s]  surprising that I haven't done this. It works. Holy shit. Okay that's really... Oh I need to go
[20578.54s -> 20597.66s]  get guns right? I don't want heat going in here. What the hell? Oh I thought I just shot electricity
[20597.66s -> 20621.08s]  out of the gun. What? You're good. All right. Why are people like dead in here? Okay you can purchase
[20621.16s -> 20633.02s]  melee weapons. Wait a minute. Oh no. Holy shit. Okay I definitely want this. I want the sludge
[20633.02s -> 20660.12s]  hammer. I want the baseball bat. Okay cool. How do I switch between them? You can only have one
[20660.12s -> 20697.66s]  melee weapon at a time. Can I trade this in? What a bad time to do that. What are you looking at?
[20697.66s -> 20723.51s]  Eat eat eat. Quick quick quick. Oh a titan. Right through. Perfect fit. There's no way you got
[20723.51s -> 20749.29s]  through that too. Three stars. Sorry I got three stars. I'll um damn it. Just go. Nobody is just
[20749.29s -> 20765.11s]  unloading the whole clip. Are they still shooting? Who's still firing? I can't tell who's shooting.
[20768.98s -> 20802.84s]  Who's still firing? Can I get in the bed? Leave me alone. I thought that was gonna hurt me. I need
[20802.84s -> 20808.14s]  to get some more respect. I need... Wait wait wait wait wait. Hold on a minute. I need to... That's a
[20808.14s -> 20849.70s]  store. Okay this place is called Friendly Fire. I want to go there. Nice iPad. I like iPads. Really
[20849.70s -> 20875.53s]  guys. All at once now right? You gotta go with the skid. Are you actually arresting me? Oh fine. I
[20875.53s -> 20906.28s]  don't care. No way. The Andes. I want to do the surf thing. Can I not do the surf thing here?
[20911.43s -> 20940.01s]  Get up there. It looks like I'm stuck in the windshield. Okay enough playing around. Next
[20940.01s -> 20953.77s]  person that runs me over. Freeze. I mean I have I have to do something with this right? Can I buy a
[20953.77s -> 20980.76s]  hot dog? I've just run. I didn't kill him. He's fine. All right we gotta get the hot dog to fight
[20980.76s -> 20997.88s]  somebody. Follow me. No don't run. Don't run. You just wanted to fight me. This is bullshit. I wanted
[20997.88s -> 21019.83s]  you to... You can be the hot dog if you want. Am I actually in trouble again? All right get me over
[21019.83s -> 21033.90s]  there. I need some weapons. Remember you're a big bully only in GTA games. I swear I'm a very sweet
[21033.90s -> 21047.22s]  sweet boy outside of Grand Theft Auto third-person games. I promise. I'm a nice young man outside of
[21047.22s -> 21086.95s]  this. I didn't even see those people. This is far away. Geez. You get respect for bailing out of the
[21086.95s -> 21119.38s]  car. Hi. Can I take the safe? Ooh all right. Pistols. SMG. Shotguns. Rifles. Special. Throne.
[21119.38s -> 21137.34s]  All right I want this thing. This is a 12 gauge. I'm buying it. Okay. You have this weapon. Shotgun
[21137.34s -> 21146.42s]  ammo. I have the... Okay I already have this. Holy shit. Hell yeah. Magnum. I want it. Bad.
[21147.14s -> 21166.82s]  I'm wasting so much money. Check the special weapon cache. What does that mean? Oh I think I'm
[21166.82s -> 21180.28s]  gonna do pistol. All right. I don't want to spend all my money. Wait. Weapon cache. Spacebar.
[21180.84s -> 21191.56s]  Bring to weapons cache. Oh I see what you mean. Okay. Dual 44 shepherds. Are you kidding me?
[21191.56s -> 21218.15s]  Wow. Okay. Double 12 gauge. I want the sledgehammer. This is insane. All right. I definitely want to
[21218.15s -> 21233.61s]  put this on. All right cool. Let's go. That's what I'm talking about. Oh that's sick. All right. Now
[21233.61s -> 21251.42s]  give me all the money in the register. Get to the safe. Thank you. Wait this is not the thing. I
[21251.42s -> 21257.21s]  didn't want to fucking kill that lady. Honest to god damn god. I didn't want to do that. I actually
[21257.21s -> 21262.12s]  didn't want to throw it at her and kill her. And now I don't know what I'm doing. I'm gonna test
[21262.12s -> 21276.52s]  this on you. It works. Why did I do that? Pick up the safe. No. And then I threw... I just wanted
[21276.52s -> 21301.05s]  to get rid of it. What a dumb ass. These things are powerful. Holy shit. Why is it telling me to go
[21301.05s -> 21333.80s]  this way? What the hell? There's only 30 seconds here. This is gonna be tricky. All right. The
[21333.80s -> 21344.78s]  first thing that somebody says is what I'm gonna eat tonight. What is it? I haven't. I didn't even
[21344.78s -> 21352.76s]  look at the chat. I have no idea what you wrote. Dude this one is really hard. I'm not sure I'm
[21352.76s -> 21364.01s]  gonna be able to do this one. Yeah I can't do this one. Holy shit. I got 25 more seconds. I'm an idiot.
[21364.73s -> 21390.28s]  All right. I saw a taco. Sounds pretty good. Don't follow the GPS you donkey. No. Stop it.
[21390.28s -> 21396.18s]  What are you doing? No. Not my Wellington. Three, two, one.
[21405.74s -> 21428.34s]  I got it. I'm not gonna make it. I wasn't getting seconds added. That was horseshit. Stuff cross
[21428.34s -> 21452.09s]  pizza. I'm just testing to see if it works. I have not had Popeyes yet. That's a good idea.
[21452.09s -> 21459.02s]  All right. Let's do a mission. What time is it? Oh shit. It's been a long time. I'm having a good
[21459.02s -> 21472.94s]  time. This is really fun. All right. I'm gonna go to the casino. This is a pretty long drive from
[21472.94s -> 21478.97s]  here. We'll play this again. I'll probably be live at some point in the middle of the week.
[21478.97s -> 21484.01s]  Like Wednesday or Thursday. Keep an eye on the sus. End of the stream voice? Almost. Not quite.
[21494.71s -> 21501.83s]  How do you feel about the asbestos allegations? That I've been like eating it? What are you talking
[21501.83s -> 21534.42s]  about? All right. Here we go. The rain makes the game lag so much. There were people waiting for
[21534.42s -> 21561.70s]  me down that alleyway. Don't let her get out. Did I get it? I got it. Okay. She just exploded I think.
[21563.37s -> 21574.87s]  Oh man. I didn't do it. Okay. I want to try this. I want to get this right.
[21583.54s -> 21603.10s]  I want to see how you do this. All right. Follow to the safe. Go to the safe. What's going on?
[21603.10s -> 21616.66s]  Keep your cursor on its head. Will you go to the safe? All right. There are raccoons in the trash
[21616.66s -> 21627.93s]  outside. They're gonna get me. Go to the safe. All right. Open it up. You all right? Okay. Thank
[21627.93s -> 21651.38s]  you. Is there money in there? Oh, this is a cheeseburger. All right. Oh, nope. Do I know you?
[21651.46s -> 21688.38s]  Oops. You're a psycho. This Saints Row 2. We're not playing Putt-Putt's Great Adventure.
[21690.71s -> 21700.12s]  I'm not playing like a math game. I thought I was going to fall through the middle.
[21704.28s -> 21707.48s]  Oh my god. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[21707.48s -> 21715.16s]  wait. I gotta get the camera. Is there a camera? I swear to god there's a camera in this game.
[21715.16s -> 21752.94s]  Isn't there? Is there a camera? Is there a camera? Can I get in? Sure. I guess that is fine that it
[21752.94s -> 21786.62s]  happened like that. Who drove the car? A drift. Oh, MonkaW. I can do that one better, I think.
[21786.62s -> 21790.70s]  There's a better way to say that. Instead of like MonkaW. I get kind of caught up a little bit.
[21791.42s -> 21800.50s]  It should be like MonkaW. No, it's gotta be harder, right? Because MonkaW is much closer
[21800.50s -> 21811.54s]  and much more like holy shit. It'll be way more force behind it. I don't know why I thought I
[21811.54s -> 21843.27s]  could climb that. All right. Where's the casino? Let me in. Oh, that's not the entrance.
[21844.73s -> 21861.42s]  Wrong one. Is it this side? Yeah, save the game for sure. That sounds, yeah, MonkaW sounds too
[21861.42s -> 21874.14s]  forced. You're right. No, I completely agree. Where is this building? Where is it? Isn't it this one?
[21882.14s -> 21914.06s]  There it is. Oh, here's every single mukbang video you've ever watched in your entire life.
[21947.32s -> 21957.14s]  That's a lot. That's a lot of what the fuck, dude. Excellent. All right, it's fucking nine thousand
[21957.14s -> 21995.96s]  dollars. 10, 20. Oh, yo, yo. Something's wrong with me. I swear to God. 13, edit. Hey.
[21998.06s -> 22007.21s]  All right. Shut up. I've had enough of that behavior. It's like, just stop it. There's no
[22007.21s -> 22029.08s]  reason to be doing that. Like, why? This is so bad. Okay. Let me get this right here. 18. Oh,
[22029.08s -> 22046.55s]  it means you're going to have 20. You fucking idiot. How did I know? Anytime you play blackjack,
[22046.55s -> 22052.23s]  you always assume the dealer has a 10 underneath. So you just assume that that is a 10 that's not
[22052.23s -> 22073.85s]  shown. What a dog shit hit. I have zero dollars now. I lose. The game crashed. That's probably
[22073.85s -> 22082.18s]  a good place to stop, I think. Right at the exact pretty much six hour mark. That was really fun,
[22082.18s -> 22087.13s]  though. We'll do that again. Maybe we'll do that again at some point in the middle of the week.
[22087.13s -> 22096.49s]  Still trying to keep the twice a week thing going. You can always pretty much assume there'll be
[22096.49s -> 22099.83s]  something on the weekend and then something somewhere in the middle of the week. Somewhere
[22099.83s -> 22105.16s]  like Wednesday, Thursday, and like maybe Sunday. I was thinking about maybe doing Saturday, Sunday,
[22105.16s -> 22113.10s]  but I don't want that much time to pass. Because back three or four months ago, I was doing
[22113.10s -> 22122.57s]  Saturday to Saturday, essentially. I want to really try to get on that one stream every four
[22122.57s -> 22132.66s]  or five days rather than one stream every seven or eight days. We're going to play Saints Row 2
[22132.66s -> 22142.20s]  again because I'm very invested. That was a lot of fun. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. Thanks for
[22142.20s -> 22149.96s]  watching. Here are all the subs today. Thanks, everybody. I no longer call out that many subs
[22149.96s -> 22161.58s]  anymore, but I still really appreciate it. Yeah, we'll see what's going on in the middle of the
[22161.58s -> 22169.98s]  week. I'm either going to play this again or maybe we'll do some co-op stuff. We'll see. I just live
[22169.98s -> 22179.24s]  life by the wings or something. Whatever it is. I just wing it. We'll see you again. Keep an eye on
[22179.24s -> 22189.40s]  the sauce over the next few days. We are going to... Let's raid Ludwig. I want you to tell Ludwig
[22189.72s -> 22200.09s]  we listened to the Christmas album and I thought it was phenomenal. I want you to make sure you
[22200.09s -> 22215.35s]  tell Ludwig that it was really good. And don't... Yeah, don't be stupid. It actually was really good.
[22215.35s -> 22220.63s]  Like, I'm jealous at the musical talent. I really am. I didn't even know he could sing. They can
[22220.63s -> 22232.38s]  say... Like, that's cutie, right? As well. They can sing. Are you guys still... Are you grounded?
[22232.38s -> 22236.38s]  Yeah, you are, because I saw that first part when I raided Vinnie. And you still did it. You're
[22236.38s -> 22246.44s]  grounded. All of you. Every single person collectively. All right. I'll see you guys later.
[22246.44s -> 22254.41s]  Thanks for watching, as always. Go say the Christmas album is fire. And I will see you guys in
[22255.43s -> 22287.46s]  probably a few days. Keep an eye on the sauce. Take care of yourselves. Have a great night.
[22287.46s -> 22314.39s]  Get this to 8K. I want an 8K raid. Influencer Andy. You've got 10 seconds to do it. At least 7,500.
[22314.39s -> 22328.97s]  Come on. I know you guys can do it. Come on. I know you can. There's still so many of you that
[22328.97s -> 22346.07s]  haven't done it. I did my part. Yeah, thank you. Irma, you look kind of like Ernest.
