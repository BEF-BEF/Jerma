[1.46s -> 7.66s]  Hello everybody. Sorry I'm late again. I said last night I was like, you know, we're not gonna be
[7.66s -> 14.12s]  late today, but then I had to get some stuff ready. I had to do some stuff like it typically is.
[15.00s -> 23.08s]  I want to be starting at like 3 33 ish pm pacific time, but man am I pushing that forward now.
[25.22s -> 28.90s]  This is an outlier though. Don't expect streams to start like this.
[30.49s -> 34.65s]  Really gonna be trying to stay consistently like we were for the first couple of months here
[35.93s -> 43.02s]  at like 5 to 6 pm eastern around like three ish pm pacific. Oh I got the wrong,
[43.74s -> 47.66s]  what's even on the title right now? Bird? How is this done? Pretty, oh fuck, hold on.
[53.26s -> 63.51s]  Hotline, yes this is dog. I don't know. I just, I need it for it just to, for a second. I'll
[63.51s -> 71.69s]  change it in a second. There we go. Okay, is it changed? Because I want to make sure that
[71.69s -> 80.30s]  the VOD's gonna be all fucked up if I don't do that. That's, that was a, I had a tenth
[80.30s -> 84.97s]  of a second to figure that. I'm gonna change that title, don't worry. I'm gonna play hotline
[84.97s -> 91.61s]  Miami 2 tonight. Oh I need to put these teabags somewhere. I have two teabags that I don't know
[91.61s -> 95.96s]  what to do with and I'm not putting them on my nice desk. I guess they can go right here.
[102.46s -> 106.38s]  Hello, yes this is dog. Yeah I know that's a terrible fucking shitty title.
[107.10s -> 115.42s]  Just give me like, just give me like a 15 second minute. I gotta get these teabags out
[115.42s -> 121.75s]  of here. Go through, right? Well I'll just get rid of them when I take a break here in
[121.75s -> 127.75s]  a little bit. But anyways, I hope you guys are doing well. Let me just make a tweet and
[127.75s -> 225.50s]  we will get started. Give me one minute. Okay, as the motorcycle goes by. So yeah, hotline Miami 2.
[226.14s -> 229.98s]  Welcome everybody. I'm gonna make sure from the birdhouse yesterday, the chair isn't on
[229.98s -> 236.86s]  the right spot. I need to move that. Why is it? All right, there we go. Is that better?
[237.74s -> 241.98s]  Does that feel better? My mouse pad, this is a gamer game. I gotta make sure my mouse
[241.98s -> 255.02s]  pad's in the right place. Oh, sorry I bumped ya. Okay, think. I think I'm ready. How's the bird doing?
[255.02s -> 262.62s]  Uh, bird's doing all right. What bird? What? Oh the birdhouse. Okay, I got a bird now.
[266.57s -> 270.76s]  I'm never gonna finish this game. Well I finished the last one. Is this one
[272.23s -> 282.34s]  worse than the last one? All right, I'm gonna do a new game. I'm ready. I'm gonna get the
[282.34s -> 293.88s]  first act coming in here. And you need the audio too, don't you? Uh, it's kind of quiet,
[293.88s -> 298.71s]  like very quiet. For some reason. I'll put it on in a minute here. Hold on, don't worry.
[300.36s -> 305.61s]  Uh, man, this party stinks. I fucking hate these people. Who invited all these
[306.41s -> 315.50s]  morons. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Uh, what do you guys think about tonight? We gonna do it?
[316.06s -> 328.47s]  Um, I have my door. I gotta close my door. Okay, there we go. He's talking about chat.
[329.19s -> 338.57s]  Where's the face cam? No, I'll, I'll, just, I'll, god damn it. Do you guys really want a camera?
[339.13s -> 344.46s]  Do I have to put a face cam on? All right, well, let me get to the end of the cut scene. Just
[344.46s -> 349.35s]  wait. What do you guys think about tonight? We gonna do it? I don't see why not. I'm sick
[349.35s -> 355.61s]  of this shit. Yeah, let's do it. Uh, I like the duck bill guy's my favorite. The weapons
[355.61s -> 361.94s]  are in the car, right? So we are actually doing this. I thought he was gonna scream. He
[361.94s -> 366.07s]  has a screaming face. Game audio. I know, I know. I just gotta get to the end of the
[366.07s -> 370.82s]  cut scene. I can't, if I hit escape, then I'm gonna like fuck it all up, aren't I?
[370.82s -> 378.54s]  Let's do it. All right, here we go. Why was that so loud? Why is this so much louder than
[378.54s -> 397.13s]  the game? What the fuck? All right, this, is that better? Don't ask me why the MNU
[397.13s -> 402.98s]  for some reason is five times louder than the actual video game. I feel like I'm shooting
[402.98s -> 425.50s]  you guys with a fucking laser. How's that? It's a little better, right? Louder. Ow! Uh,
[425.50s -> 433.54s]  I don't, I can't, why can I not go any louder? What the fuck is happening? Why is my volume
[433.54s -> 443.48s]  mixer so fucked up? Does that help? No, dude, I'm at max fucking volume on Windows.
[445.98s -> 458.94s]  Well, that's okay. Odd, but whatever. All right, so that's, I guess that's as long
[458.94s -> 465.98s]  as I can fucking make it. That's what it's gonna have to be like, apparently. All right,
[465.98s -> 473.77s]  here we go. Uh, party sucks. W A S D, just like the last game. It's got puking in there.
[475.16s -> 480.36s]  I can leave through here, get in the van. Ow, it's so much louder. What the hell is happening right
[480.36s -> 485.56s]  now? What is going on? It just shouldn't be like this.
[495.94s -> 498.66s]  All right, what in the name of God was that all about?
[498.66s -> 509.46s]  That can't be that fucking loud. That's too loud. I think that's a reasonable level.
[510.60s -> 519.70s]  Maybe like one more. All right, I don't even need a fucking tutorial. I'm a goddamn natural.
[519.70s -> 532.78s]  Look at how loud this is. Are you sure about this? What the fuck? Turn on face cam.
[533.42s -> 551.64s]  Oh my God, fine. Jesus Christ. I gotta go through this door, I think. Yep, I think it's
[551.64s -> 569.94s]  okay. How do I open the door? Can you not just open doors like this? No, you can. Something's
[569.94s -> 575.85s]  wrong with my audio sync. I can't really fix it, so I'm gonna have to deal with it
[575.85s -> 603.43s]  for now. Ooh, that hurt. There's no bullets in that gun. What the fuck? How many bullets
[603.43s -> 607.59s]  do I have? Where do I see? Oh, just empty. Combo beginner, nice. Okay, that's cool.
[608.55s -> 635.00s]  Got it. Ooh, I almost didn't get it. No, give me that. What are you guys saying? Get it? Okay.
[635.00s -> 652.94s]  Ah! Oh my God. Okay, I gotta pay attention. Oh, shift. I forgot I could do shift. I forgot
[652.94s -> 671.02s]  about that. Damn it. It's gonna go fucking fast, man. Fuck it. No, I'm not. Damn it. Holy shit,
[671.02s -> 680.04s]  how did I stay alive? All right, slow it down. This is like kind of hard for the first
[680.04s -> 688.89s]  level. I guess I could go in the left room. I need a melee weapon. I'm alerting the whole
[688.89s -> 713.13s]  horde. Okay, that works. Who the fuck are you? Oh God. Play one more guy and then
[714.26s -> 725.06s]  that's it, right? Just one more guy? All right, got it. That was fucking ridiculous.
[729.22s -> 744.15s]  I got these bags, though. Whatever. Go to car. I don't... Where is the...
[745.11s -> 762.90s]  Was the car down a level or what? No, it's right there. What are you guys saying? Entire stream
[762.90s -> 773.88s]  is broken. What's wrong with my stream? I don't know what you guys are talking about, but
[773.88s -> 777.40s]  I don't know if there's a problem with the stream that I can't really fix it, so
[777.40s -> 795.94s]  I'm sorry. Happy Halloween, sir. I'll give you 14 tithes or your pizzas are on the counter.
[795.94s -> 804.94s]  Okay, cool. Enjoy your meal and watch out for ghosts tonight. Okay, bye. More free food.
[804.94s -> 820.84s]  That's pretty cool. I like that. What? I don't understand. Turn off the cam? What the
[820.84s -> 830.22s]  fuck are you guys talking about? Fine. Turn cam off. What's going on? Turn it back on and
[830.22s -> 854.98s]  sync it. Is it fixed now? Is it better? Don't even look good. Are you... Okay. In a
[854.98s -> 865.91s]  stressful day, you wouldn't believe what they have been doing. Stand up. I...
[867.35s -> 880.81s]  Stand up. I don't understand. Stand like... I don't get it. What? What's happening? Stand up.
[889.40s -> 899.75s]  It's fixed. Jesus. I don't know... Oh, this is falling. Hold on. Hold on. I fucked it
[899.75s -> 919.40s]  up. There we go. Okay. There we go. Nice. I believe what they've been doing. I should
[919.40s -> 933.59s]  probably go home and get some sleep. All right, you have a nice night. You too,
[933.59s -> 942.95s]  sweetheart. Okay. I don't know what that means, but that's fine. Go to the car,
[942.95s -> 953.64s]  I guess. I don't... I mean, I think I have to... Second scene. I... I'm playing
[953.64s -> 966.89s]  without fucking headphones tonight, guys. I don't like the sounds. They scare me. Got
[966.89s -> 988.18s]  it. Got it. That's blocking the... That's blocking the shit. Hold on. Got it. No,
[988.18s -> 997.80s]  wait. Watch out for the guy in the room. I gotta be careful here. Sound effects
[997.80s -> 1000.52s]  are too loud. The music is... I... Hold on. I can fix it. Hold on. Let me
[1000.52s -> 1008.70s]  give it... Give me a second. Maybe that'll help. Better? What happened to
[1008.70s -> 1015.32s]  my cursor? Okay. There we go. I think that's good. Yeah. I think we're
[1015.32s -> 1021.40s]  good. One guy in here. Two guys, actually. Let's go... Let's try to get a
[1021.48s -> 1028.34s]  door and then smash, right? Oh, that guy didn't see me. How? Empty. Empty.
[1028.34s -> 1037.66s]  Empty. We're good. There we go. Up the floor and we're good. That should get us
[1037.66s -> 1043.72s]  up there. This way. Oh, I thought that... I didn't think that was a wall.
[1043.72s -> 1067.32s]  Oops-a-daisy. Fuck. Fuck. Damn it. Oh my god. This is too stressful
[1067.32s -> 1089.16s]  for me. Can you believe this shit? I think I got him. Ah, I just gave it
[1089.16s -> 1096.63s]  to him. Oh, that was close. That was real...
[1096.63s -> 1123.03s]  Anymore? I don't think there's anymore. Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
[1123.03s -> 1148.30s]  Fuck! Oh my god! I blown it! Oh! Fuck. All right, I'll get it. I'll be fine.
[1148.30s -> 1155.98s]  Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. I got it. All right. Let me think
[1155.98s -> 1162.90s]  about this logically here. I'm gonna say punch through door, kick guy,
[1162.90s -> 1166.63s]  get them both in two shots. One shot, three shot. Got it. Nice.
[1166.63s -> 1170.79s]  All right. Just... How many guys down here? Just the two, right?
[1174.38s -> 1178.60s]  Oh, come on. That was lucky. All right. Oh, we got one guy.
[1178.60s -> 1186.26s]  What about down there, though? I'm scared to even go down there. It's just
[1186.26s -> 1193.00s]  one, two, three. I should get them very quickly here. The door got the fucking
[1193.00s -> 1214.57s]  way again. Got it. Okay. Go to the car. Well,
[1214.57s -> 1223.21s]  this isn't good. Do I have to fight this? Am I in trouble here?
[1223.21s -> 1229.46s]  Drop your weapon and get down on the ground now. Don't shoot. I'm
[1229.46s -> 1237.29s]  detective. Here's my badge. I'm sorry, sir. Lower your weapons, boys.
[1237.29s -> 1245.61s]  What's the situation in there? Look for yourself. It's a bloodbath in there.
[1245.61s -> 1250.54s]  Man, sometimes I hate this city. What about the car? Okay.
[1250.54s -> 1256.10s]  That's kind of interesting. I go to the car. Which car? My car or their car?
[1256.10s -> 1287.70s]  Okay. There it is. Nice. C+. All right. That's fine. It's first
[1287.70s -> 1306.65s]  level. C plus streamer strikes again. That was the worst joke this year.
[1306.65s -> 1310.41s]  That was the last... What do you mean? You don't know what you're talking
[1311.37s -> 1323.05s]  about. Turn the face cam back on. I'll turn it back on
[1323.05s -> 1332.49s]  when I feel like it's necessary to turn back on. Another murder case, huh?
[1332.49s -> 1339.34s]  Yeah. It looks like you've got a serial killer on your hands. Same MO as the
[1339.34s -> 1341.66s]  guy you found last week. Message and all.
[1341.66s -> 1346.34s]  I'm innocent. They forced me to do it. Yeah, right. I haven't heard that
[1346.34s -> 1349.27s]  before. The guy must be some kind of psycho, huh?
[1349.27s -> 1355.99s]  Creeps me out. Guess it'll make the press happy, though.
[1355.99s -> 1378.15s]  Guess it'll make it happy. Okay. I don't know. I have no idea.
[1378.31s -> 1380.55s]  Seems they need... Oh, look. It's a love for the...
[1380.55s -> 1395.91s]  This just seems a bit too standard. No gore details. God, the city sure makes
[1395.91s -> 1403.43s]  your skin thick, doesn't it? I was born with thick skin. Have you
[1403.43s -> 1407.54s]  guys found any clues? Not really. He got his throat slit.
[1407.54s -> 1413.77s]  Haven't found the murder weapon yet. No fingerprints. No witnesses. Nothing.
[1413.77s -> 1418.60s]  I'll let you know. Anything turns up. All right. Fucking bye.
[1418.60s -> 1440.25s]  Bye. You do that. I'll head down to the station and get started on the
[1440.25s -> 1450.18s]  paperwork. All right. Have a nice night, sir.
[1450.18s -> 1481.54s]  Yeah, we'll see about that. I don't know about whether I...
[1481.54s -> 1495.74s]  What? Who knows? I think it's a kind of an issue.
[1495.74s -> 1525.02s]  Yeah. I'm sorry. You're a fucking dork? Hey, I'm just trying to enjoy Hotline
[1525.02s -> 1550.70s]  Miami 2 with camp tonight. Yeah. Let's see what happens here.
[1550.70s -> 1555.43s]  Oh, what the hell? Who am I? A new character?
[1555.43s -> 1565.93s]  Good day. This is Eric from Miami Auto Repairies. I'm calling to tell you
[1565.93s -> 1570.34s]  that we have finished service. Hello, who is this? Let me talk to
[1570.34s -> 1575.86s]  your boss, okay? Swing on by Northworth 12th Avenue place
[1575.86s -> 1579.14s]  and pick. Hey, I'm talking here. We guarantee the
[1579.14s -> 1587.29s]  best service in town. Don't you hang up on me, damn it.
[1587.29s -> 1592.74s]  Show some goddamn respect. This looks like fat me.
[1592.74s -> 1610.50s]  Let's watch me fucking ace this round. So this is a new
[1610.50s -> 1619.86s]  character? Third scene. Hard news. This is where it happened. I gotta
[1619.86s -> 1622.18s]  get the fucking cam on for this one, you know what I'm saying?
[1622.18s -> 1626.58s]  Lethal throws. Yeah, let's get it on. Let's fucking jam this.
[1626.58s -> 1664.68s]  This side over here. There's a window. Oh, they can shoot through windows.
[1664.68s -> 1669.85s]  Somebody's there. Nah, I gotta get these two. Hit the guy
[1669.85s -> 1677.30s]  at the door when he comes out. Take his gun. He's slow to kill with
[1677.30s -> 1680.50s]  melee. Lethal throws though. I gotta remember
[1680.50s -> 1683.86s]  that. Lethal throws. Lethal throws. Whoa!
[1683.86s -> 1703.38s]  Wow, fucking window. Actually, fuck it. All right. What about the window?
[1703.38s -> 1711.42s]  That can see right through the window, right? One guy up here. Guy through the
[1711.42s -> 1713.50s]  window. I'm gonna get the guy through his own window.
[1713.50s -> 1719.45s]  Like that. One more bullet for the guy in here with the gun. Watch this. Ready.
[1719.45s -> 1723.06s]  Three, two, one, action. Whoa! Okay, I'm fine.
[1723.06s -> 1734.94s]  Ah! Oh, my fucking keys. I hit caps lock. Lethal throw is... fuck. All right.
[1734.94s -> 1750.94s]  Get up with the guy over here. Yeah, I had the same idea, dickhead.
[1750.94s -> 1759.00s]  All right, guy through the window. That's not a lethal throw.
[1759.00s -> 1766.26s]  I hit the door. Okay, that's fine. Anybody? Is there another guy in this?
[1766.26s -> 1771.18s]  Right here. Oh, that didn't go through. Fuck, it's empty now. He's coming for me.
[1771.18s -> 1775.85s]  He's coming for me. No! Pick up the... Oh, fuck!
[1775.85s -> 1782.04s]  Okay, I'm fine. I want that gun on the ground right there.
[1782.04s -> 1789.34s]  Get... get it! Okay, I got it. Okay, who do we got for guns?
[1789.34s -> 1794.17s]  I don't think there's anybody left with a gun. There's only the guy up there
[1794.17s -> 1796.97s]  with the gun. There's a window. So we're gonna have to go... we're gonna
[1796.97s -> 1800.82s]  have to snipe somebody. This guy right here. Let's see if
[1800.82s -> 1803.94s]  I can get him. Okay, got that guy. Did it pull anybody
[1803.94s -> 1819.91s]  else? I'm still paranoid for this guy right here.
[1819.91s -> 1822.87s]  Dammit, I was even trying to shoot you! I was trying to shoot him!
[1822.87s -> 1826.23s]  Oh, that guy's a gun. All right, I'm going the other way.
[1826.23s -> 1835.27s]  Didn't get a double, but that's fine. Where's he going? All the way around?
[1835.27s -> 1845.46s]  Give me your gun. Uncam on each corner of the screen.
[1845.46s -> 1857.29s]  No, I can't do that. I'm gonna get sniped by somebody else. I'm gonna be
[1857.29s -> 1863.26s]  so angry about it. Holy fuck, that was so panic
[1863.26s -> 1865.66s]  inducing. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[1865.66s -> 1874.22s]  All right, anything else in here? Give me a fresh gun.
[1874.22s -> 1884.14s]  What else I can grab? People are gonna get so angry with me.
[1884.14s -> 1887.02s]  Dude, you missed the mask! Go get the mask, dude!
[1887.02s -> 1902.97s]  Did I really hit the plant right there? What do we got? We got a guy with a gun.
[1902.97s -> 1912.90s]  Watch out for the guy. Get the seat through the glass.
[1912.90s -> 1917.06s]  Ah, and I didn't get shot. Holy fuck, how? Holy fuck, I'm being so stupid
[1917.06s -> 1919.30s]  right now. Okay, stop, stop. Cool down.
[1919.30s -> 1923.91s]  This guy right through the glass. You stupid idiot!
[1923.91s -> 1948.49s]  Oh, damn it. Oh, now I'm going too fast. I can slow down.
[1948.49s -> 1951.93s]  Fuck, I had it. I just had it too. I had it. I had it.
[1951.93s -> 1971.48s]  I think I got two people there. Holy fuck. Let me get a closer look.
[1971.48s -> 1974.68s]  There's nobody with a gun in there. There's a guy with a gun up there.
[1974.68s -> 1978.90s]  What happened? Why did I just spin around like that? That was wild.
[1978.90s -> 1983.19s]  Guy, there's a guy. What was that? Why did I just like spin
[1983.19s -> 1997.72s]  fucking around like 180 degrees? Turned my aimbot on for some reason.
[1997.72s -> 2007.83s]  I'm not using one of those. Ass right here. All right, one guy here.
[2007.83s -> 2010.87s]  Sorry, he's gonna come all the way around and I'm gonna throw it at him.
[2010.87s -> 2016.26s]  What happened? Is he dead? Is that a lethal throw? What the fuck did I do?
[2016.26s -> 2021.66s]  Oh my god, what did I do? Oh my fucking god, what the hell?
[2021.66s -> 2026.14s]  Does every throw kill? All right, I'm sorry. I have to turn
[2026.14s -> 2028.86s]  the music down. It's so loud in my ear and it's
[2028.86s -> 2047.38s]  fucking my brain. All right, here we go. It's the, I shouldn't,
[2047.38s -> 2053.18s]  don't even lock on to somebody. He's gonna come through. Shoot him.
[2053.18s -> 2065.90s]  My goodness, Jeremy. Get good. Get good. You know what I mean? That's what people
[2065.90s -> 2069.02s]  say nowadays. They go, get good. No, hold on. It's better than that.
[2069.02s -> 2072.78s]  They go, get good. I can't do it. I drank too much fucking tea and my
[2072.78s -> 2078.38s]  like throat is all closed up. That means you're allergic to tea.
[2078.38s -> 2095.98s]  I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay, that guy's a gun.
[2095.98s -> 2100.42s]  How safe am I here? This is only rebel chill.
[2100.42s -> 2104.66s]  This is only rebel deadedated rare. Right? Somebody laughing at that. Wasn't
[2104.66s -> 2126.38s]  that funny? Fuck. Yeah, remember that like funny
[2126.38s -> 2130.25s]  video? That like, that was like, cute video.
[2130.25s -> 2148.76s]  I don't have a fucking gun. Oh, what do I do about this? What do I do?
[2148.76s -> 2164.92s]  Still throws. Okay, we're good. That was a real life reaction.
[2164.92s -> 2168.34s]  Yeah, dude, if somebody is chasing you with a knife,
[2168.34s -> 2172.78s]  stabbing forward at you, you're gonna go, oh no, what the fuck do I do?
[2172.78s -> 2183.03s]  That was a real reaction. Is that it? Can I throw the briefcase at him?
[2183.03s -> 2189.58s]  This fucking boomer using auto lock. I was told to use that.
[2189.58s -> 2193.26s]  I said, somebody said, use auto lock. It helps sometimes. I don't use it all
[2193.26s -> 2197.61s]  the time. There you go. That's the C plus
[2197.61s -> 2202.17s]  content you signed up for. Now, okay, like a one out of ten
[2202.17s -> 2205.21s]  stream is if somebody has a black screen and they were just sleeping,
[2205.21s -> 2209.69s]  right? Two out of ten stream is if somebody is
[2209.69s -> 2213.45s]  streaming themselves sleeping with the camera on. Three out of ten stream is
[2213.45s -> 2217.46s]  building a birdhouse. Four out of ten stream is playing
[2217.46s -> 2223.50s]  Hotline Miami with auto lock. Just wait till you fucking see a five out of
[2223.50s -> 2226.01s]  ten stream. You're not even gonna know what hit
[2226.01s -> 2249.83s]  you. I just went back up. How am I locked? I know it's out here.
[2249.83s -> 2254.50s]  All right, it's gonna be more than a C plus. If that's the case, this is a
[2254.50s -> 2258.36s]  seven out of ten stream. That's a seven that that's a seven
[2258.36s -> 2261.40s]  out of ten stream or sixty nine and ten. Seven to one.
[2261.40s -> 2273.50s]  Got a new mask. Ervin. 20 face cams are right. I will crash my computer.
[2273.50s -> 2282.90s]  Hi there. Welcome. What can I help you with? I'd like to get a tattoo.
[2282.90s -> 2289.11s]  Right, you got anything particular in mind? All right, so every time I see
[2289.11s -> 2293.58s]  this guy's face, I keep imagining, I keep seeing like a
[2293.58s -> 2298.55s]  hippopotamus mouth. Like where his chin is, that's the
[2298.55s -> 2302.07s]  top of the hippopotamus's mouth and there's a big bottom half that's
[2302.07s -> 2307.58s]  underneath that. I want an old dixie right here. Okay, sure.
[2307.58s -> 2313.06s]  Let me see. Right, how does this Friday sound? That's what you look like.
[2313.06s -> 2319.74s]  I don't look like this. Friday, what do you mean? You can't do it now?
[2319.74s -> 2323.98s]  It has to be today. It's a special occasion today. I'm celebrating.
[2323.98s -> 2326.94s]  Sorry boss, can't help you. We're all booked for days.
[2326.94s -> 2330.87s]  Does that so? What kind of business are you running here? You just lost
[2330.87s -> 2335.91s]  yourself a customer. You Russian asshole. Whatever you say, boss.
[2342.95s -> 2349.91s]  Yeah, just you guys wait. Just you guys wait for the Bionic Boomer stream.
[2349.91s -> 2354.07s]  It's gonna be a lot of fun. I'd like to welcome our next guest on the show,
[2354.07s -> 2358.97s]  famous from critically acclaimed movies such as Blue Ocean, The Calm, and Land
[2358.97s -> 2363.96s]  of Trees. Here's Martin Brown. Hi Martin, how are you?
[2363.96s -> 2368.54s]  I'm good. Now your latest film is a bit of a step in a new direction for
[2368.54s -> 2370.54s]  you. A lot of people are surprised by this.
[2370.54s -> 2375.66s]  Some are even calling you a sellout. Bionic Boomer tonight
[2375.74s -> 2384.01s]  or Riot. Do you understand that I can't get keyboard pants and like laser eye
[2384.01s -> 2388.49s]  tracking devices that this is gonna take like a couple of weeks to put
[2388.49s -> 2394.39s]  together. A lot of people are surprised by this.
[2394.39s -> 2398.33s]  Some are calling you a sellout. What's your response to that? A sellout,
[2398.33s -> 2401.19s]  huh? How do you mean? Well some are saying
[2401.19s -> 2405.51s]  that Midnight Animal is just another slasher flick.
[2405.51s -> 2411.38s]  That's not how I see it. I have wanted to do this for a long time.
[2411.38s -> 2417.66s]  Kill kids. Strangle them. Beat people's heads in.
[2417.66s -> 2421.18s]  Rip their eyes out. Just listen to them. Oh my god.
[2421.18s -> 2426.18s]  What the fuck? I finally get to do that. Okay.
[2426.18s -> 2432.23s]  Don't look at me like that. What? I say this is a dream, right?
[2432.23s -> 2435.67s]  What do you mean? This is all, this is just a dream, right? I'm not sure I
[2435.67s -> 2444.55s]  follow. Okay pause. You think this is a
[2444.55s -> 2447.78s]  dream? Well then maybe it's time to wake up.
[2447.78s -> 2454.30s]  Who are you? Who am I? I'm not the one being interviewed here, am I?
[2454.30s -> 2459.75s]  I think I should be the one asking the questions. This movie you're making, you
[2459.75s -> 2463.93s]  know how it ends. I believe there's a pretty big twist at
[2463.93s -> 2468.94s]  the end. I doubt you'll like it. In fact, I don't think anyone will. Maybe
[2468.94s -> 2471.02s]  you ought to get out before it's too late.
[2471.02s -> 2475.02s]  I don't think so. You really enjoy hurting other people, don't you?
[2475.02s -> 2481.34s]  It's just a film. Just a film, huh? That's one way to look at it.
[2481.34s -> 2485.74s]  Oh and then right after that, Batman and Superman are like shitting in a
[2485.74s -> 2488.87s]  stall together. And like you can hear the loud fart
[2488.87s -> 2500.81s]  poop noises. Nobody, nobody knows what I was just
[2500.81s -> 2505.94s]  doing there. What are you talking about? That's,
[2505.94s -> 2510.92s]  wow, I must be out of touch. That was a robot chicken segment and we moved to
[2510.92s -> 2513.96s]  another one. Like don't, what are you talking about?
[2513.96s -> 2525.40s]  Don't you remember like robot chicken? It would do like the shh and change to
[2525.40s -> 2527.72s]  like the superheroes that are really cool but
[2527.72s -> 2536.81s]  they just like fart in each other and like get,
[2536.81s -> 2543.18s]  just get it, right? Does anybody get it? You generally aren't in your head.
[2543.26s -> 2550.89s]  Are you sure? It looks like the police is here.
[2550.89s -> 2554.98s]  The girl must have told on you. You better go along obediently, they'll take
[2554.98s -> 2557.86s]  you to her. What's that you want? Well that's what you want, isn't it?
[2557.86s -> 2567.62s]  Click. Hold it right there. Why am I wearing this mask?
[2567.62s -> 2570.26s]  We're here to arrest you. You need to come with us. We'll take you down
[2570.26s -> 2574.12s]  to the station. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[2574.12s -> 2580.73s]  Apparently not. You can't tell me that robot chicken
[2580.73s -> 2585.46s]  is a boomer show. That, that was, that's like still on the air.
[2585.85s -> 2589.05s]  And if it's not, it was off the air like five years ago.
[2589.05s -> 2594.26s]  You know what you've been up to and you're gonna fry for it. Girls upstairs
[2594.26s -> 2596.10s]  giving us her full statement right now.
[2596.10s -> 2599.38s]  It's gonna be on their way down here for you. Until then you're stuck with
[2599.38s -> 2604.82s]  me. I'd like to ask why did you do
[2604.82s -> 2607.78s]  what you did? Do you even know you, you don't even
[2607.78s -> 2611.22s]  know yourself? Do you, what, can the phone fucking, somebody pick up the phone?
[2611.22s -> 2616.55s]  Look at me. You're fucked. Completely fucked in the head.
[2616.55s -> 2620.63s]  Aren't you? Why else would anyone be killing kids in a pig's mask, huh?
[2620.63s -> 2626.33s]  Oh my fucking god. It's the phone. You should answer it.
[2626.33s -> 2630.25s]  I'll say it again. There is no phone. I don't see no phone and I don't hear no
[2630.25s -> 2632.33s]  phone, okay? It's just a figment of your
[2632.33s -> 2636.33s]  imagination, you hear me? You're insane. A maniac. And soon enough
[2636.33s -> 2643.40s]  you will pay for your crimes. The telephone. You're not gonna answer.
[2643.40s -> 2652.07s]  There's just no point talking to you, is there? What the fuck?
[2652.07s -> 2654.31s]  You know what needs to be done. It's not like even looking. It's like he
[2654.31s -> 2668.04s]  wants you to click. Do I, is this the, what the
[2668.04s -> 2671.80s]  fuck is this game? The last game was like answering phone calls
[2671.80s -> 2679.22s]  and like fighting people. Why do I have to be this like creepy guy?
[2679.22s -> 2698.44s]  And like, anything else? This one has a strange elaborate story.
[2698.44s -> 2704.38s]  Whoa, I could break the toilet. I know it was a TV, you know what I'm saying.
[2704.38s -> 2714.15s]  You guys are like inside my head, you know what I mean by that.
[2714.15s -> 2720.92s]  I, get off of him. What are you doing? Hi.
[2720.92s -> 2729.66s]  Okay, all right. Both dead, right? I'm not gonna shoot any weapons. I'm not
[2729.66s -> 2732.38s]  gonna shoot a gun. Let me just see if I can do this without.
[2732.38s -> 2746.79s]  You guys coming around here? Am I safe? Oh, not safe, not safe. Oh, damn it.
[2746.79s -> 2750.15s]  I would have had it potentially too there. Fuck, what am I doing?
[2750.15s -> 2754.06s]  What about up there? Let me try going, no. I'm gonna wait for this patrol to go
[2754.06s -> 2761.78s]  by and I'm gonna go up. Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no. I
[2761.78s -> 2773.83s]  get a better idea. Never mind.
[2773.83s -> 2777.11s]  Yeah, I used to get shot right in the fucking face. It was a decent idea
[2777.11s -> 2786.39s]  and it still is. I'm gonna try it again. Give me a fucking break.
[2786.39s -> 2802.58s]  How did it, you don't even notice that you, how do you not notice this?
[2802.58s -> 2807.24s]  What the fuck? How did you not notice that?
[2807.24s -> 2810.84s]  Why do you have the intelligence of the orcs from Shadow of Mordor? Come
[2810.84s -> 2831.35s]  on. Where the fuck did you guys even
[2831.35s -> 2841.58s]  come from? I'm gonna do that. Shit, I'm gonna
[2841.58s -> 2851.21s]  throw it at him and then I'm gonna sit in this room.
[2851.21s -> 2854.98s]  Okay, give me the gun. I have items in here now.
[2854.98s -> 2859.14s]  Now it's just a question of trying to get this done.
[2859.14s -> 2862.18s]  Okay, so now I can get, I should be able to cleanly kill this guy right
[2862.18s -> 2872.54s]  here without a problem, right? One, two, three, go. Guy in this
[2872.54s -> 2887.03s]  room, I'm gonna get him. Holy fuck you! Okay, calm down. The
[2887.03s -> 2889.11s]  trolls are gonna, I'm gonna forget about them.
[2889.11s -> 2895.59s]  What about over there? Yeah, this guy that way.
[2895.59s -> 2908.97s]  These guys don't have guns though. Oh shit.
[2908.97s -> 2916.71s]  No! God damn it. God damn it. Oh come on man, what the hell was I
[2916.71s -> 2942.09s]  doing there? There's only a couple guys left. Oh
[2942.09s -> 2949.75s]  you fucking door. Oh you fucking door. Is that guy live?
[2949.75s -> 2956.95s]  Just gave them a wall. I hate, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I can't
[2956.95s -> 2958.87s]  believe it. God damn it, this level is
[2958.95s -> 2968.15s]  really fucking hard. Come on man, I had it right there too.
[2968.15s -> 2984.73s]  This shit was done. How did he not throw it?
[2984.73s -> 2992.73s]  Holy shit, this is insane. All right, get like the sweaty fucking hand
[2992.73s -> 3004.36s]  syndrome out of here. Light my fucking hand, I'm like
[3004.36s -> 3019.99s]  covered in water. 13 bullets. Okay, good. I think I did it.
[3019.99s -> 3025.22s]  Okay, just, I'm gonna keep the pistol. Just be very careful here.
[3025.22s -> 3027.86s]  There's no reason to freak out. I'm gonna wait till they turn around. There's
[3027.86s -> 3031.72s]  only three guys left. Four. That guy doesn't have a gun.
[3031.72s -> 3037.46s]  Nine bullets. That was a monster energy spread.
[3037.46s -> 3040.58s]  I don't even know what that means, but I guess I'll agree with you. There he
[3040.58s -> 3051.40s]  is, right here. One, two, three. Where's the
[3051.40s -> 3057.11s]  patrol? They're up there. That's a monster
[3057.11s -> 3063.40s]  energy. Stop distracting me. Oh my lord, I almost lost it right
[3063.40s -> 3065.72s]  there. I almost just lost it and I thought I didn't, I didn't. I just
[3065.72s -> 3072.79s]  barely got it. Oh man, okay. Anybody else have a gun? These two
[3072.79s -> 3081.38s]  guys don't have guns. Only one guy has a gun in there, but
[3081.38s -> 3096.73s]  he does have one. No, two guys with guns. Got me the
[3096.73s -> 3100.79s]  gun here. Okay, let's go for it. Nobody up or down,
[3100.79s -> 3121.59s]  right? No one's gonna like snipe me. Oh, give me your gun. Oh,
[3121.59s -> 3125.51s]  just go? What do you mean just go? Stay in here and you'll be safe. I'm
[3125.51s -> 3128.31s]  gonna go see what's going on. Don't open the door until I get back
[3128.31s -> 3135.22s]  no matter what. Just go. That's easier said than
[3135.22s -> 3141.11s]  oh, the fucking window. I didn't even know there was a window here.
[3141.11s -> 3147.02s]  Well, I didn't know those things. How did I not shoot the guy with the gun?
[3147.02s -> 3165.96s]  What's this guy? Why is Death Eater here? What's no, Reaper?
[3165.96s -> 3172.33s]  Why is Reaper from Overwatch? Death Eater?
[3172.33s -> 3182.17s]  Whatever his name is. Reaper. I am terrified to go over here. This
[3182.17s -> 3197.62s]  only has one bullet. Alright, where's Reaper? There he is.
[3197.62s -> 3203.19s]  Oh, fuck you. Oh my god, is he dead? He's dead, right?
[3203.19s -> 3206.87s]  Is he? He's not dead. Is he dead now? He's not dead now.
[3206.87s -> 3231.54s]  The head off. Okay, got it. I can't take his guns? Oh, oh, wait a minute!
[3231.54s -> 3245.58s]  Oh, no! Oh, fuck. No, god damn it. Damn it.
[3245.58s -> 3257.69s]  And I have to fight Reaper again. I think that's the only way you can
[3257.69s -> 3265.45s]  kill him. You have to like rip his head off.
[3265.45s -> 3270.06s]  Alright, this time I'm not gonna just run over there. There's
[3270.06s -> 3273.50s]  one, two. Anybody down there? I think there is. I can't see that far.
[3273.50s -> 3283.88s]  There's a guy right there with a gun. Oh, no. Is he running up here?
[3283.88s -> 3299.88s]  I don't know which way he's gonna go. I'm hiding. I don't have any guns. I
[3299.88s -> 3301.56s]  don't have any guns. Guns, guns. Give me a gun.
[3301.56s -> 3313.18s]  Like, pull him into the bathroom? He has a shotgun, but I gotta get into
[3313.18s -> 3315.90s]  this room, I think. Is there anybody else in that room?
[3315.90s -> 3325.51s]  No, there's not. It's, it's, it's of these windows.
[3325.51s -> 3341.74s]  Oh, my goodness. Why can I not go over there?
[3341.74s -> 3345.50s]  What kind of aim do you have? What kind of aim do you have?
[3345.50s -> 3349.34s]  What kind of aim? What's that? You shot,
[3349.34s -> 3352.78s]  I locked onto him and he shot to the left and he shot to the right of him.
[3352.78s -> 3362.15s]  What is the aim that I, what kind of aim is that?
[3362.15s -> 3385.96s]  Oh, fuck. This is bad. Maybe not. No, I need, give me the gun.
[3385.96s -> 3393.18s]  Fuck you. What do I do about Reaper? I can't believe it.
[3393.26s -> 3397.34s]  I had it too and it was done and I did, I just didn't get it done.
[3397.34s -> 3404.34s]  Because that, the bullshit shitty aim thing.
[3404.34s -> 3412.36s]  All right, get over here, Reaper. Come on.
[3412.36s -> 3417.13s]  Why is it always holy? What do you mean holy?
[3417.13s -> 3419.69s]  Like, there's nobody else over here. We're gonna shoot Reaper, break his
[3419.69s -> 3424.01s]  neck. Sorry, my throat.
[3424.01s -> 3432.17s]  I wish I could take his guns. Honest to god. Okay.
[3432.17s -> 3441.64s]  Do it again. Maybe I should just go that way.
[3441.64s -> 3449.18s]  What is that way? I can't believe it didn't hit.
[3449.18s -> 3456.86s]  Actually, no, no, no. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Oh god,
[3456.86s -> 3460.06s]  Jeremy. How did, I got stuck in the wall.
[3460.06s -> 3474.44s]  Who the fuck is that guy? Okay. Yeah, I needed
[3474.44s -> 3479.56s]  two shots to kill like the, whatever that guy was.
[3479.56s -> 3486.60s]  You stupid game. No fucking way. No way. No way. There's no way.
[3486.60s -> 3502.90s]  I don't believe it. I don't even believe it was possible.
[3502.90s -> 3508.79s]  That's impossible. Yes, I'm doing the movie villain thing at the end of the
[3508.79s -> 3511.83s]  movie, but it really is. I understand the villain now. I
[3511.83s -> 3518.52s]  know what he's saying. How it's not possible.
[3518.52s -> 3523.56s]  Damn it. Why did that have to happen? He just like
[3523.56s -> 3528.66s]  instantly fucking 180 pixel turned on me.
[3528.66s -> 3540.47s]  Give me a break. I got stuck on the fucking wall.
[3540.47s -> 3579.75s]  I wish it would prioritize guns that have ammo in them.
[3579.75s -> 3597.43s]  How do I check that box? Get in this room.
[3597.43s -> 3601.99s]  Room to room. Guy over there. They both have guns. I have four shots.
[3601.99s -> 3612.65s]  Did I get them both? I did not get them both.
[3612.65s -> 3626.82s]  Okay, now. I didn't. My brain wasn't prepared for a guy to come around the
[3626.82s -> 3632.25s]  corner like that. Oh my god. Why?
[3632.25s -> 3653.62s]  It was over. It was fucking over. It was done. And this guy right here.
[3653.62s -> 3657.85s]  You don't even have to know. I won't get to walk across the whole map. Did I hear a gunfire?
[3657.85s -> 3661.85s]  Have I heard gunfire the entire game? The whole floor?
[3661.85s -> 3666.17s]  Now I'll go out on this 600th shot this time. I think I heard something.
[3666.17s -> 3688.90s]  I broke the mic. I'm gonna get it this time. I'm gonna be prepared for
[3688.90s -> 3700.65s]  guy on the left. Got them both. I did. Okay.
[3700.65s -> 3707.00s]  Wait a minute. Wait. No, he's not here.
[3707.00s -> 3712.42s]  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I only have two bullets though. I need a
[3712.42s -> 3716.44s]  different gun. Does any- I only have- I gotta get
[3716.44s -> 3723.27s]  the guns that these guys dropped. Okay. I turn to like Vince McMahon sometimes.
[3723.27s -> 3731.77s]  Like I'm casting a wrestling event. Anybody hear that?
[3731.77s -> 3740.50s]  Did anybody hear that? Is what I need to know. I only have two bullets.
[3740.50s -> 3752.54s]  I have to make a count. Pick up the gun before I do something
[3752.54s -> 3757.34s]  where I scream. Okay. I think I got it.
[3757.34s -> 3762.15s]  There's that one last guy. I'm not fucking around. I'm gonna go all the
[3762.15s -> 3763.91s]  way around because he can shoot me through the glass.
[3763.91s -> 3769.75s]  Because there is glass down here. Don't shoot me through the glass. I want to
[3769.75s -> 3779.78s]  shoot you through the glass. Okay. Get the keys. I can't go in
[3779.78s -> 3810.44s]  here? Who has the key? Oh, Reaper does.
[3810.44s -> 3819.83s]  I'm not your fucking girlfriend. Wait. What happened? I have to-
[3819.83s -> 3823.11s]  Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. What? What?
[3823.11s -> 3828.60s]  What? Okay. I was about to freaking freak out.
[3828.60s -> 3833.14s]  Cut. No need for a retake. That was perfect. This is a movie.
[3833.14s -> 3835.78s]  Good job, guys. Spectacular performances. So this is the movie that
[3835.78s -> 3842.58s]  the guy was talking about. I only got a few more shots to shoot
[3842.58s -> 3846.10s]  before we can move on to editing. Why don't you go grab something to eat
[3846.10s -> 3851.02s]  while we put in the new set piece. Make sure you're back in 30 minutes, okay?
[3851.02s -> 3855.62s]  Time is money. You heard him, Martin. Time to get up,
[3855.62s -> 3866.26s]  Martin. You spent all that time in rage on a movie.
[3866.26s -> 3872.97s]  71,000 is the total. That's a pretty good score so far.
[3872.97s -> 3878.34s]  I got a better than an A. I got 110 points. I got extra credit.
[3878.34s -> 3881.70s]  I remembered what the teacher's favorite candy was because that was the
[3881.78s -> 3886.92s]  extra credit question. Good thing I got it. I would have had a
[3886.92s -> 3903.75s]  probably a C-. Second act rising. 1991 Miami, Florida.
[3903.75s -> 3906.79s]  Ah, the defendant claims that he was ordered to commit these murders through
[3906.79s -> 3912.90s]  messages left on his answering machine. Did you investigate these claims? Yes,
[3912.90s -> 3916.23s]  we did. And what did you find? Well, the
[3916.23s -> 3920.23s]  defendant's answering machine was empty. The tape had been removed.
[3920.23s -> 3924.36s]  Did you find anything supporting these claims of threatening phone calls?
[3924.44s -> 3930.84s]  No, sir, we did not. I see. No further questions.
[3930.84s -> 3934.04s]  You say you found no physical evidence supporting my client's claims. Then
[3934.04s -> 3936.44s]  what about phone records? Surely the police would have
[3936.44s -> 3941.82s]  no difficulty accessing such information. Indeed, we didn't investigate
[3941.82s -> 3945.74s]  the defendant's phone records. And did you find any calls on record that
[3945.74s -> 3953.26s]  could support my client's claims? We did, sir. The defendant seems
[3953.26s -> 3959.96s]  to have received phone calls that match the time frame which he
[3959.96s -> 3964.25s]  suggests. But did you manage to trace these calls? If so,
[3964.25s -> 3969.22s]  where did they come from? We traced the calls to a nightclub
[3969.22s -> 3974.89s]  called the Golden Truck Stop. Yes, now my client claims that he was
[3974.89s -> 3978.41s]  coerced by the Russian mafia to commit the crimes for which he was
[3978.41s -> 3981.37s]  now being prosecuted. Do the police have any knowledge of
[3981.37s -> 3984.57s]  ties between the Golden Truck Stop and the Russian mafia that could
[3984.57s -> 3988.73s]  support my client's claims? The venue has been linked to several
[3988.73s -> 3992.31s]  mob related crimes in the past. Yes, however, that would be all. Thank
[3992.31s -> 3997.27s]  you. No further questions. The witness may step down. The court will
[3997.27s -> 4001.00s]  now be adjourned. Proceedings will continue tomorrow at 11am.
[4001.00s -> 4004.94s]  Meanwhile, the defendant will remain in police custody. Who's
[4004.94s -> 4020.42s]  that? I think that's supposed to be me. Food in the trash? No. Time
[4020.42s -> 4024.44s]  to make a phone call. Leave a message on somebody's machine.
[4024.44s -> 4027.08s]  You've reached the Miami Police Department. How may I help you?
[4027.08s -> 4031.59s]  I'd like to talk to Detective Pardo. Tell him it's from Evan.
[4031.59s -> 4034.84s]  One moment, please. Click. What do you want, Evan? I'm in the
[4034.84s -> 4039.37s]  middle of something here. Hi, Manny. I'm at the courthouse doing
[4039.37s -> 4043.42s]  research on that masked maniac. What's that got to do with me?
[4043.42s -> 4046.41s]  Well, they mentioned the Golden Truck Stop. Something about mob
[4046.41s -> 4050.22s]  connections. So, I was wondering if you know anyone that I can
[4050.22s -> 4053.26s]  talk to. That's privilege information. You know I can't
[4053.26s -> 4057.40s]  talk about things like that. Look, I'm really busy here.
[4057.40s -> 4063.93s]  1-800-HIGH-SCHOOL-MUSICLE. Don't be like that now. You owe
[4063.93s -> 4068.95s]  me one, remember? Fine. Go to Northwest 37th Avenue. Ask
[4068.95s -> 4072.25s]  for Petrov and tell him I sent you. Can't promise he'll
[4072.25s -> 4074.57s]  talk, but it's the only name I've got. Don't call me at
[4074.57s -> 4089.82s]  work again, okay? No more favors. Okay. Why is this just
[4089.90s -> 4095.56s]  the courtroom from Chrono Trigger? When you get tried?
[4095.56s -> 4113.37s]  These are the same models. All right, let's go. Okay. Why is
[4113.37s -> 4120.62s]  everybody holding a boombox? Are these the guys playing the
[4120.62s -> 4133.64s]  music? Is it a protest or something? All right. Cameras.
[4133.64s -> 4144.07s]  Fifth scene. First trial. Here we and here we go. The
[4144.07s -> 4146.87s]  Joker. The Joker. The Joker. The Joker. The Joker. The
[4146.87s -> 4154.92s]  Joker. Oh my god. Did he just make a Joker reference? I'm
[4154.92s -> 4158.58s]  here to see Petrov. Tell him Detective Pardo sent me.
[4158.58s -> 4162.39s]  No, I don't think so. If you don't have an invitation,
[4162.39s -> 4171.50s]  you better leave. Okay. What the fuck was that? Am I
[4171.50s -> 4174.22s]  bringing him back to life? Hold on. I killed him and now
[4174.22s -> 4175.26s]  I'm bringing him back to life.
[4180.39s -> 4185.24s]  What? What the fuck was that, Jeremy? It was the
[4185.24s -> 4188.65s]  fucking Joker. Help. Somebody call an ambulance. There's
[4188.65s -> 4202.39s]  been an accident. Is there anyone here? Oh, pick up
[4202.39s -> 4204.47s]  the gun. What are you doing? Why can I not pick the
[4204.47s -> 4219.30s]  gun up? What? Am I like non-violent? Oh shit. Okay. I
[4219.30s -> 4232.26s]  gotta go. Oh, you idiot. You idiot. Idiot.
[4244.49s -> 4260.87s]  What about the guys with the guns? Oh, you idiot. I get
[4260.87s -> 4262.87s]  it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Okay. I get it. I'm
[4262.87s -> 4264.79s]  disarming the guns. I get it. I understand it now. So
[4264.79s -> 4282.95s]  they can't use them. I get it. What's that guy with
[4282.95s -> 4302.81s]  the fucking gun right there? Oh, you idiot. Oh shit.
[4302.81s -> 4310.26s]  He got up. Oh fuck. Okay. Get it. Go get the gun.
[4335.91s -> 4340.90s]  And excuse me, all of you watching at home. I'd like to
[4340.90s -> 4344.82s]  know what killed me behind the corner. I'd like to
[4344.82s -> 4352.36s]  have an explanation as to who did it. Oh, that
[4352.36s -> 4361.29s]  guy. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the explanation. Okay.
[4361.29s -> 4362.73s]  That's actually pretty good. I'd rather go.
[4367.72s -> 4375.32s]  Does this guy fight? Is the guy gonna attack me?
[4375.32s -> 4377.24s]  Okay. So after they get knocked down, they don't
[4377.24s -> 4386.33s]  care anymore. Is that what I'm understanding? All
[4386.41s -> 4391.61s]  right. Okay. And if I, I clearly very clearly like
[4391.61s -> 4394.89s]  I punched him. I did. I punching him. He's being
[4394.89s -> 4419.32s]  punched. That's all I wanted. Fuck. Oh my God.
[4419.32s -> 4427.98s]  Oh my God. Now that they all see me. Okay. Is
[4427.98s -> 4433.34s]  there anybody? I can't tell. I need to get that
[4433.34s -> 4439.80s]  gun. I need that back. I need that fucking thing
[4439.80s -> 4449.66s]  back. Nobody else, right? Nobody else. Nobody
[4449.66s -> 4456.50s]  else. Oh, I didn't do it right. I didn't do it
[4456.50s -> 4465.27s]  right. I didn't do it right. I didn't do it
[4465.27s -> 4469.27s]  right. You can knock them out with space bar.
[4469.27s -> 4471.13s]  What are you talking about? Isn't that what
[4471.13s -> 4483.16s]  I'm doing? Okay. So that's why I didn't do it
[4483.16s -> 4508.60s]  because it takes fucking forever to do that. I'd
[4508.60s -> 4511.40s]  love to know what world that was. What fucking
[4511.40s -> 4512.84s]  world are we living in when that doesn't kill
[4512.84s -> 4518.97s]  them? Okay. Put this down here. Disarm. Disarm it.
[4518.97s -> 4521.13s]  I can't disarm that. Okay. Well, I don't even need
[4521.13s -> 4524.31s]  to. All right. I'm gonna get this motherfucker
[4524.31s -> 4545.77s]  right now. And I threw the fucking thing. I just
[4545.77s -> 4548.81s]  want to put it down. I just wanted to place it
[4548.81s -> 4551.69s]  below me. I didn't have to throw it. I just
[4551.69s -> 4566.07s]  whipped it across the game. I'm gonna go
[4566.07s -> 4582.65s]  around. Too long. Too long. Too long. That
[4582.65s -> 4585.69s]  takes too long. Okay. I got it. Don't fuck
[4585.69s -> 4596.41s]  this up. It's an easy throw. Okay. I'm good.
[4596.41s -> 4605.10s]  Now the knife. Holy shit. I didn't even see
[4605.10s -> 4611.53s]  him. Guy with a gun. Anybody else around
[4611.53s -> 4613.37s]  the corner? I'm fucking paranoid. Hold on. Let
[4613.37s -> 4617.98s]  me go this way. I don't know. Is there a guy
[4617.98s -> 4621.00s]  with a gun up here? No, there's not. Okay.
[4621.00s -> 4623.40s]  Wrap around. I just want to see. There is
[4623.40s -> 4624.68s]  a kid. There's more. There are more people
[4624.68s -> 4628.97s]  up here. I'm gonna go the other way.
[4628.97s -> 4637.29s]  Because I gotta throw it at this guy. I got
[4637.29s -> 4638.49s]  it. I got it. But the other guys have
[4638.49s -> 4641.70s]  guns too. What? What about? What do I do
[4641.70s -> 4643.86s]  about that? I think I have to go the other
[4643.86s -> 4653.26s]  way. Ugh. No, I don't. Here he comes. Oh,
[4653.26s -> 4657.46s]  fuck. Anything else? Okay. I disarmed the
[4657.46s -> 4660.71s]  gun. Just two guys with melee and a guy
[4660.71s -> 4665.82s]  with a gun. Just wait till he stand up.
[4665.82s -> 4667.50s]  I'm not taking the- I'm not taking the
[4667.50s -> 4671.75s]  time to do the animation. How far up is
[4671.75s -> 4680.07s]  he? All the way up, right? It's good,
[4680.07s -> 4681.59s]  right? He's done. Spacebar's not doing
[4681.59s -> 4683.35s]  anything. One guy left. I have to sneak
[4683.35s -> 4684.31s]  up behind him and throw this in the
[4684.31s -> 4689.18s]  back of his head. Holy fuck, he
[4689.18s -> 4692.79s]  turned around really quickly. Okay.
[4692.79s -> 4698.62s]  Thank god. There's more of this shit.
[4698.62s -> 4710.90s]  There's more of this shit. I can't hit
[4710.90s -> 4713.13s]  him through the window. All right.
[4713.13s -> 4720.52s]  Disarm. Who's left? Two more guys. Oh,
[4720.52s -> 4721.88s]  fuck. Not through the window. Not through
[4721.88s -> 4722.60s]  the window. Don't get me through the
[4722.68s -> 4731.21s]  window. Disarm their guns. This is too-
[4731.21s -> 4732.09s]  No, that guy can see me through the
[4732.09s -> 4737.27s]  window. Oh, Kenny? Is anybody below? If
[4737.27s -> 4738.63s]  I go over there, I- you know what I'm
[4738.63s -> 4742.57s]  saying? If I do this, he can see me
[4742.57s -> 4747.34s]  through the fucking window.
[4747.34s -> 4757.88s]  Oh, fuck. Dude, do it. Do it. Get off
[4757.88s -> 4759.96s]  of him. How do I get off this guy?
[4759.96s -> 4763.08s]  How do I get off this guy? Oh, okay.
[4763.08s -> 4764.28s]  I got it. I'm good.
[4764.28s -> 4783.88s]  Okay. This game's- this game is so
[4783.88s -> 4785.88s]  stressful. It's too- how am I gonna
[4785.88s -> 4793.14s]  get into this guy? I have to throw
[4793.14s -> 4797.67s]  it at him. I have to throw it at him.
[4797.67s -> 4804.58s]  Oh, my bike. I just like-
[4804.58s -> 4814.78s]  Okay, I did it, right? What's left?
[4814.78s -> 4819.80s]  Somebody down here?
[4819.80s -> 4826.01s]  Are there windows down here? Okay, no
[4826.01s -> 4828.41s]  windows, but I gotta make this good.
[4828.41s -> 4834.38s]  Oh, should I not be killing?
[4834.38s -> 4836.86s]  I just threw him in the fucking bathtub.
[4836.86s -> 4838.70s]  I need those.
[4838.70s -> 4852.92s]  Who's this? Who the hell are you?
[4852.92s -> 4854.68s]  Oh, hey. There's a cutscene going on
[4854.68s -> 4856.60s]  here. Ah, I-
[4856.68s -> 4859.64s]  Do I not- um, are you Petrov?
[4859.64s -> 4862.12s]  I'm writing a book about the mask maniac.
[4862.12s -> 4864.84s]  Detective Pardo told me I could talk to
[4864.84s -> 4867.30s]  you about it. Detective Pardo told you
[4867.30s -> 4869.70s]  that. A friend of yours.
[4869.70s -> 4874.09s]  That's right, sir. Not a very good
[4874.09s -> 4875.93s]  friend. I take it I'm ready.
[4875.93s -> 4877.37s]  Son sending you here all of all
[4877.37s -> 4879.30s]  places. You know, I reckon you're
[4879.30s -> 4880.98s]  right about that, sir. Okay, give me
[4880.98s -> 4882.34s]  control back and I'm gonna get it.
[4882.34s -> 4883.94s]  Guy in the- hold on, I gotta look at it again.
[4883.94s -> 4884.98s]  This book you're writing must be very
[4884.98s -> 4886.66s]  important. Risking your life to come
[4886.66s -> 4887.86s]  talk to me. Sure, you've got- you've got
[4887.86s -> 4889.86s]  balls. What is it you want to know?
[4889.86s -> 4891.86s]  You get two questions. Then you get the
[4891.86s -> 4893.06s]  fuck out of here.
[4893.06s -> 4895.61s]  Okay, I have to turn around. I gotta-
[4895.61s -> 4899.27s]  ANS. Hold ANS. Swing around. Swing.
[4899.27s -> 4900.63s]  All right, the police claims the
[4900.63s -> 4902.23s]  Masked Ritterers were part of a
[4902.23s -> 4905.03s]  vigilante movement. Are you of the
[4905.03s -> 4908.15s]  same opinion?
[4908.15s -> 4910.42s]  No. I don't think they were
[4910.42s -> 4911.86s]  vigilantes. They were much too
[4911.86s -> 4913.06s]  organized.
[4913.06s -> 4914.98s]  They knew our exact locations and had
[4914.98s -> 4916.90s]  insight into our inner workings.
[4916.90s -> 4918.18s]  I don't know what they were a part
[4918.18s -> 4919.86s]  of, but it was a group. No group of
[4919.86s -> 4921.46s]  vigilantes.
[4921.46s -> 4922.66s]  Why do you think they targeted the
[4922.66s -> 4923.78s]  Russian mafia?
[4923.78s -> 4925.78s]  What were they after? I can't tell you
[4925.78s -> 4927.54s]  what they were after, but
[4927.54s -> 4929.22s]  they effectively destroyed our whole
[4929.22s -> 4931.86s]  organization and then they were gone.
[4931.86s -> 4932.98s]  They knew what they were doing and
[4932.98s -> 4935.51s]  they seemed to be trained very well.
[4935.51s -> 4936.87s]  We caught a couple of them alive,
[4936.87s -> 4938.86s]  tried to break them. None of them
[4938.86s -> 4940.38s]  talked, not a single one.
[4940.38s -> 4941.42s]  All right, no more questions. Get the
[4941.42s -> 4942.62s]  hell out of my sight. Here we go.
[4942.62s -> 4957.27s]  Okay. What do I do about this? Okay,
[4957.27s -> 4960.60s]  we're fine.
[4960.60s -> 4973.37s]  Okay, we're good. Bad end. Bad end.
[4973.37s -> 4978.65s]  Why is it the bad end? What do you
[4978.89s -> 4980.25s]  mean bad end?
[4980.25s -> 4988.23s]  Actual maniac. You killed someone.
[4988.23s -> 4990.79s]  I accidentally, because I was panic
[4990.79s -> 5000.63s]  pressing the button.
[5000.63s -> 5005.42s]  Don't listen to them. Don't listen to
[5005.42s -> 5006.38s]  chat.
[5006.38s -> 5013.38s]  Well, that's all right. That's a D+.
[5013.38s -> 5021.37s]  That's the first time I've had a D+.
[5021.37s -> 5024.57s]  I've only had Cs in the first game.
[5024.57s -> 5027.37s]  And Bs and As. Still passing grade. I'm
[5027.37s -> 5028.55s]  okay.
[5028.55s -> 5032.30s]  What a day. Did something happen?
[5032.30s -> 5035.10s]  No, well, yeah. That guy Petrov, he
[5035.10s -> 5036.06s]  wouldn't see me.
[5036.06s -> 5037.58s]  Almost got beaten up just trying to get
[5037.58s -> 5041.13s]  in. Hey, you actually
[5041.13s -> 5043.37s]  went there. Didn't figure you would. Man,
[5043.37s -> 5044.73s]  sometimes I wonder why I hang out with
[5044.73s -> 5045.45s]  you.
[5045.45s -> 5048.17s]  When did you become such a douchebag?
[5048.17s -> 5049.69s]  Well, I did tell you to write about
[5049.69s -> 5050.97s]  the Miami
[5050.97s -> 5053.93s]  mutilator instead, didn't I? A much more
[5053.93s -> 5055.37s]  sophisticated case.
[5055.37s -> 5056.41s]  Really, and you wouldn't have to
[5056.41s -> 5057.53s]  talk to them all.
[5057.53s -> 5058.97s]  People will have forgotten about those
[5058.97s -> 5060.41s]  vigilantes by the time your book's
[5060.41s -> 5061.29s]  out.
[5061.29s -> 5064.31s]  I accidentally stomped a guy's head to
[5064.31s -> 5065.91s]  the wall and blasted his brother's
[5065.91s -> 5067.19s]  torso with a shotgun.
[5072.76s -> 5075.16s]  Come on. Besides, I bought you a beer,
[5075.16s -> 5076.44s]  right? And you didn't really get hurt,
[5076.44s -> 5077.08s]  did you?
[5077.08s -> 5079.80s]  Let's call it even. Thanks for the
[5079.80s -> 5082.60s]  beer and all, but you still owe me one.
[5082.60s -> 5084.60s]  All right, all right. Don't forget I'm
[5084.60s -> 5086.12s]  putting my job on the line.
[5086.12s -> 5087.56s]  If anyone finds out I'm giving you
[5087.56s -> 5089.32s]  leads, that'll be it for me.
[5089.32s -> 5093.69s]  You'll be fired for incompetence or
[5093.69s -> 5095.13s]  misconduct before that happens. I'm
[5095.13s -> 5096.17s]  surprised they haven't fired you
[5096.17s -> 5097.21s]  already.
[5097.21s -> 5099.61s]  I'm tired, let's get out of here. Yeah,
[5099.61s -> 5100.97s]  I should get some sleep too. You want
[5100.97s -> 5102.68s]  a ride?
[5102.68s -> 5109.72s]  I'll take my chances on the bus. Wait,
[5109.72s -> 5112.15s]  who the fuck am I? Okay, I'm the
[5112.15s -> 5113.43s]  different character now.
[5113.43s -> 5125.34s]  All right, did you just try to kill him? I
[5125.34s -> 5126.78s]  was not trying to kill him. I just pressed
[5126.78s -> 5127.82s]  space on him
[5127.82s -> 5129.10s]  to see if there's extra dialogue
[5129.10s -> 5133.69s]  sequences. September 2nd, 1991.
[5133.69s -> 5135.37s]  So we're going somewhere special
[5135.37s -> 5136.65s]  tonight, eh?
[5136.65s -> 5139.16s]  Yeah, my friend Jack told me he built
[5139.16s -> 5141.40s]  this place down on Northwest AA 184th
[5141.40s -> 5141.88s]  Street.
[5141.88s -> 5143.72s]  A real shithole. The whole building is
[5143.72s -> 5145.80s]  occupied by junkies and lowlifes.
[5145.80s -> 5147.72s]  Kind of like this place, huh?
[5147.72s -> 5150.36s]  Uh, fuck you, Mark. Anyway, his
[5150.36s -> 5151.72s]  sister's been hanging out with these
[5151.72s -> 5153.08s]  assholes. Hasn't been
[5153.08s -> 5154.68s]  home for weeks. He figured we'd get
[5154.68s -> 5155.72s]  her home
[5155.72s -> 5158.76s]  and teach her friends a lesson. Wait,
[5158.76s -> 5159.80s]  we're doing house calls for your
[5159.80s -> 5161.02s]  friends now?
[5161.02s -> 5162.30s]  Isn't that pretty much what we did
[5162.30s -> 5164.14s]  last time? I didn't hear any
[5164.14s -> 5165.66s]  complaints back then.
[5165.66s -> 5167.02s]  We can't patrol the streets looking
[5167.02s -> 5168.22s]  for scumbags.
[5168.22s -> 5170.47s]  We'd be in jail in no time. Yeah,
[5170.47s -> 5172.89s]  but I didn't sign up to be no hero
[5172.89s -> 5174.65s]  rescuing women and shit. That's just
[5174.65s -> 5176.01s]  not my thing. I just want some
[5176.01s -> 5179.13s]  action. So you got any better ideas or
[5179.13s -> 5180.49s]  should we just stay here and argue
[5180.49s -> 5181.13s]  all night?
[5181.13s -> 5183.03s]  I sure as hell ain't staying here. I'm
[5183.03s -> 5184.55s]  ready to roll. Am I gonna get the
[5184.55s -> 5186.30s]  the quack mask?
[5186.30s -> 5188.36s]  Fine, I'll come along. But if anything
[5188.36s -> 5189.40s]  happens to the girl, it's not my
[5189.40s -> 5191.29s]  problem. Got it.
[5191.29s -> 5194.01s]  Sure. Okay. Well, whatever. Let's go.
[5194.01s -> 5207.24s]  Slot machine? Nice. What is this fucked
[5207.24s -> 5207.88s]  up like?
[5207.88s -> 5215.64s]  Ghostbusters mobile. Moving up.
[5215.64s -> 5219.66s]  Okay, roll dodge. Killing punches. No
[5219.66s -> 5222.14s]  weapons. What is roll dodge?
[5222.14s -> 5231.26s]  When did I have this? What the fuck?
[5231.26s -> 5234.15s]  I guess I just didn't even know I
[5234.15s -> 5235.27s]  had this.
[5235.27s -> 5243.26s]  Rewind. Killing punches. I like this.
[5243.26s -> 5256.74s]  Look glee. All right.
[5256.74s -> 5258.66s]  Nice and easy. Left. Right. Look both
[5258.66s -> 5260.50s]  ways before you cross the street.
[5260.58s -> 5263.51s]  It's easy enough. I can't even pick up
[5263.51s -> 5264.39s]  weapons.
[5264.39s -> 5268.65s]  Okay, we got gun guys gotta go first.
[5268.65s -> 5280.38s]  It was pretty sloppy, but whatever. Guy
[5280.38s -> 5281.98s]  with a gun. He's gotta go first or I
[5281.98s -> 5283.10s]  can bait the guy with the knife.
[5283.10s -> 5287.74s]  Wowee. That was fucking close. Okay.
[5287.74s -> 5289.82s]  Lots of guys with guns. Might have to
[5289.82s -> 5298.55s]  actually go the other way.
[5298.55s -> 5299.43s]  Yeah, let's take these guys out
[5299.43s -> 5307.30s]  first. Another door opening down here.
[5307.30s -> 5309.53s]  Okay, that's it.
[5309.53s -> 5311.77s]  All right, I can go through there.
[5311.77s -> 5313.58s]  There's a hole in the wall, but
[5313.58s -> 5316.28s]  there's also a guy with a gun.
[5316.36s -> 5326.89s]  So it's all about the bait. I could go
[5326.89s -> 5327.45s]  down.
[5327.45s -> 5328.73s]  I don't really want anyone to shoot in
[5328.73s -> 5329.93s]  the middle here. That'll alert
[5329.93s -> 5331.13s]  everybody.
[5331.13s -> 5334.12s]  I'm thinking, I'm thinking straight
[5334.12s -> 5335.48s]  through try to kill both of them in one
[5335.48s -> 5344.06s]  punch.
[5344.06s -> 5350.74s]  Or eight. That's fine. I see windows.
[5350.74s -> 5353.58s]  No, I'm good.
[5353.58s -> 5355.10s]  One guy. That guy almost blended in
[5355.10s -> 5358.87s]  with the ground.
[5358.87s -> 5360.47s]  I almost just ran in here and
[5360.47s -> 5367.13s]  screamed. All right. So far so good.
[5367.13s -> 5368.09s]  This guy. I don't think, I don't think
[5368.09s -> 5369.61s]  this guy has a gun.
[5369.61s -> 5372.15s]  It's just the two guys up there and
[5372.15s -> 5373.99s]  then one guy. No, that's it, right?
[5373.99s -> 5375.11s]  Okay, here we go. I'm just gonna
[5375.11s -> 5377.62s]  ambush.
[5377.62s -> 5386.50s]  Not yet. No. Anything in the toilet or
[5386.50s -> 5387.54s]  anything? Nothing over here? I can't
[5387.54s -> 5389.50s]  really go anywhere from here.
[5389.50s -> 5390.78s]  All right, ambush this guy. Don't look
[5390.78s -> 5391.58s]  at me. Don't look at me. Don't look
[5391.58s -> 5392.62s]  at me.
[5392.62s -> 5394.46s]  Holy shit. That was almost very bad.
[5394.46s -> 5396.73s]  Okay, only got two guys left.
[5396.73s -> 5398.41s]  Three, actually. That's a mistake to
[5398.41s -> 5407.03s]  call it two.
[5407.03s -> 5413.21s]  No, no, no. Go back around.
[5413.21s -> 5415.50s]  This has been so clean. I haven't
[5415.50s -> 5417.82s]  died once. I'm not gonna ruin this.
[5417.82s -> 5420.50s]  I'm gonna go back around down
[5420.50s -> 5426.12s]  here.
[5426.12s -> 5427.40s]  You actually can't pick up any
[5427.40s -> 5433.91s]  weapons. All right, here we go.
[5433.99s -> 5447.08s]  Once this guy moves. Oh no, I...
[5447.08s -> 5464.33s]  fuck. Where am I standing? Okay.
[5464.33s -> 5467.29s]  Almost a disaster. Almost a fucking
[5467.29s -> 5469.05s]  complete disaster.
[5469.05s -> 5474.92s]  That's it, right? Only one more. Only
[5474.92s -> 5477.56s]  one guy left down here in this room.
[5477.56s -> 5484.84s]  Clean. As clean as it can be.
[5484.84s -> 5497.19s]  Dogs. Does me punt... Can I punch the
[5497.19s -> 5498.71s]  dog once and kill it?
[5506.07s -> 5517.74s]  Damn it. Okay. There's another guy with a
[5517.74s -> 5523.45s]  gun down there, I thought.
[5523.45s -> 5529.14s]  Is there? Oh, fuck. There was. Geez.
[5529.14s -> 5532.42s]  Geez. Geez, and a dog. Geez.
[5532.42s -> 5533.54s]  They're fast, right? They're very
[5533.54s -> 5535.29s]  fast.
[5535.29s -> 5537.37s]  I knew it was fast. I knew it was
[5537.37s -> 5538.57s]  fast too, and I just
[5538.57s -> 5540.89s]  wasn't ready for it. My muscle brain
[5540.89s -> 5542.65s]  to computer memory.
[5542.65s -> 5555.05s]  Where's the other guy? I know you're
[5555.05s -> 5559.24s]  down there, you little asshole.
[5559.24s -> 5569.00s]  Okay, dog. Get ready for it. You gotta,
[5569.00s -> 5570.70s]  you gotta be the aggressor.
[5570.70s -> 5577.21s]  Right, you know what I mean? None of these guys have guns.
[5577.21s -> 5581.05s]  This should be fairly simple. Holy shit.
[5581.05s -> 5584.15s]  He had a gun. I thought that cigarette
[5584.15s -> 5590.01s]  was a knife.
[5590.01s -> 5591.21s]  What happened? Holy fuck. Why would
[5591.21s -> 5592.97s]  they do the animation like that?
[5592.97s -> 5615.77s]  I can't... How am I gonna do that room?
[5615.77s -> 5616.65s]  I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna
[5616.65s -> 5620.90s]  do this room.
[5620.90s -> 5622.82s]  Holy shit in my pants and my fucking
[5622.82s -> 5635.13s]  face.
[5635.13s -> 5637.05s]  Get over here, man. Oh, well, I'm
[5637.05s -> 5638.49s]  thinning him out.
[5638.49s -> 5640.07s]  I'm gonna try to go around and see
[5640.07s -> 5641.83s]  if there's a better opportunity.
[5641.83s -> 5648.74s]  Doesn't look like there is.
[5648.74s -> 5656.41s]  Is there somebody down here? Somebody
[5656.41s -> 5658.26s]  with a gun?
[5658.26s -> 5664.78s]  Yep. Yep. Wowee.
[5667.66s -> 5670.06s]  How am I supposed to get in this room?
[5670.06s -> 5676.34s]  With just, with one punch man?
[5676.34s -> 5677.70s]  I have to go in that room on the
[5677.70s -> 5681.35s]  right, don't I?
[5681.35s -> 5686.34s]  Or I have to pull them out. Holy
[5686.34s -> 5687.38s]  shit.
[5687.38s -> 5701.72s]  I'm so disappointed. I just, I went
[5701.72s -> 5702.76s]  all the way back in my chair and
[5702.76s -> 5704.12s]  wrapped my head.
[5704.12s -> 5722.33s]  Christ. Oh my god.
[5722.33s -> 5738.92s]  Fuck. Damn it. Focusing on the dog.
[5738.92s -> 5742.06s]  Jesus Christ. Dog.
[5742.06s -> 5750.06s]  Like, how did I get this guy last time?
[5750.06s -> 5763.75s]  I debated him and he...
[5763.75s -> 5766.87s]  Fuck.
[5766.87s -> 5768.95s]  I just, I felt those bullets.
[5768.95s -> 5770.55s]  They missed my character and hit
[5770.55s -> 5773.64s]  me.
[5773.64s -> 5775.96s]  Come on. Why? I'm not, I'm just
[5775.96s -> 5777.24s]  clicking on the dog.
[5777.24s -> 5794.18s]  I'm not hitting space on him. Jesus.
[5794.18s -> 5796.10s]  This level is fucking brutal.
[5796.10s -> 5801.69s]  I just almost missed him. Okay, back
[5801.69s -> 5803.29s]  to where I was before.
[5803.29s -> 5809.08s]  I'm getting like, caught on my keyboard.
[5809.08s -> 5816.94s]  I forgot about the dog, but it's okay.
[5816.94s -> 5819.42s]  I got it.
[5819.42s -> 5821.82s]  All right, can I... Here's the question.
[5821.82s -> 5822.86s]  All right, I'm going for it. Go, go, go,
[5822.86s -> 5829.16s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[5829.16s -> 5831.90s]  All right. Now I have to bait him over
[5831.90s -> 5835.40s]  here.
[5835.40s -> 5838.68s]  Who has a gun? These two have guns.
[5838.68s -> 5845.74s]  Was it all three of them? I got all
[5845.74s -> 5848.47s]  three of them.
[5848.47s -> 5850.47s]  Just this guy up here. Okay, slow
[5850.47s -> 5856.18s]  down. I'm gonna get shot in the
[5856.18s -> 5865.88s]  fucking head.
[5865.88s -> 5869.82s]  Wowee. That was fucking rough.
[5869.82s -> 5875.13s]  That was rough. I say wowee a lot. I
[5875.13s -> 5875.93s]  know.
[5875.93s -> 5878.14s]  Stay back.
[5878.14s -> 5879.42s]  Whoa, take it easy. I'm just here to
[5879.42s -> 5880.94s]  get you. Your brother sent us. We're
[5880.94s -> 5882.66s]  not going to harm you.
[5882.66s -> 5884.66s]  My brother? You just killed all my
[5884.66s -> 5885.62s]  friends.
[5885.62s -> 5888.06s]  Look, we've got a car waiting outside,
[5888.06s -> 5889.98s]  so drop the gun. It's time to go.
[5889.98s -> 5891.82s]  We'll drop you off at your brother's.
[5891.82s -> 5893.61s]  You accepted to go with you? Are you
[5893.61s -> 5894.49s]  insane?
[5894.49s -> 5895.93s]  You murdered my friends. You're not
[5895.93s -> 5897.13s]  taking me anywhere.
[5897.13s -> 5899.96s]  Now leave me the fuck alone.
[5899.96s -> 5901.40s]  Fine, you have it your way. We're out
[5901.40s -> 5902.04s]  of here.
[5902.04s -> 5912.12s]  What was that? Okay. Don't do it. Don't do
[5912.12s -> 5912.92s]  what?
[5912.92s -> 5956.33s]  I'm back. All right, so that's not
[5956.33s -> 5960.63s]  part of a cutscene thing.
[5960.63s -> 5962.47s]  That actually just did happen.
[5962.47s -> 5970.18s]  Okay.
[5970.18s -> 5973.40s]  I'm...
[5973.40s -> 5977.40s]  Don't do it. Don't do it.
[5977.40s -> 5981.62s]  Don't fucking do it. How did you...
[5981.62s -> 5983.14s]  All right, I'll take that as a sign
[5983.14s -> 5985.11s]  that I...
[5985.11s -> 5986.79s]  I fucking found a new way to do
[5986.79s -> 6002.17s]  this. Dog...
[6002.17s -> 6004.65s]  Ah, come on. Come on. I beat it. I
[6004.65s -> 6006.97s]  beat it. The fucking girl had to shoot
[6006.97s -> 6008.41s]  me. Don't do it, Jeremy.
[6008.41s -> 6040.90s]  Oh, Jeremy. God. Oh, I'm standing. I'm
[6040.90s -> 6042.66s]  standing up right now. I can't... I did
[6042.66s -> 6043.38s]  this.
[6043.38s -> 6045.38s]  I already beat this mission, and I
[6045.38s -> 6047.06s]  beat it very well, too.
[6047.06s -> 6050.42s]  I took my fucking time. Oh, man.
[6050.42s -> 6051.86s]  I need to turn on like a fucking...
[6051.86s -> 6053.14s]  something in my ear. I need like a
[6053.14s -> 6054.58s]  Secret Service person to be like,
[6054.58s -> 6056.42s]  don't touch the girl.
[6056.42s -> 6063.82s]  I need someone to feed me lines
[6063.82s -> 6065.10s]  through. A fucking earpiece.
[6065.10s -> 6069.66s]  Oh, my god. I'm so salty right now.
[6069.66s -> 6071.18s]  That's the perfect word to describe
[6071.18s -> 6072.94s]  how I feel right now. It's just like,
[6072.94s -> 6073.58s]  just a...
[6073.58s -> 6078.06s]  Oh, man. Oh, man. Man.
[6078.06s -> 6087.22s]  I... I already did it.
[6087.22s -> 6090.18s]  I... I'm... I'm full fucking... Shake the
[6090.18s -> 6091.38s]  fucking pinball machine, man.
[6091.38s -> 6092.74s]  Seriously.
[6092.74s -> 6094.50s]  Just shake it up and spray it all
[6094.50s -> 6103.24s]  over the fucking ground.
[6103.24s -> 6105.80s]  I'm gonna take my time. Fucking come
[6105.80s -> 6107.93s]  on.
[6107.93s -> 6116.22s]  No. The only way to play this game is
[6116.22s -> 6120.04s]  go fast and lose fast. No, I...
[6120.04s -> 6125.53s]  Not me. I play this game with fucking
[6125.53s -> 6126.97s]  patience.
[6126.97s -> 6128.97s]  I'm trying to time my hits and shots
[6128.97s -> 6129.93s]  and getting
[6129.93s -> 6134.01s]  things where I want them. Okay, now I
[6134.01s -> 6135.13s]  can go over here.
[6135.13s -> 6136.81s]  Open this door. Bait him through the
[6136.81s -> 6140.66s]  door.
[6140.66s -> 6143.96s]  Not... Won't be long now. How did this
[6143.96s -> 6145.40s]  guy not see me? Dog! Get the dog
[6145.40s -> 6146.36s]  first!
[6146.36s -> 6166.78s]  Ah, fuck! Okay, whatever. What the fuck is this guy?
[6166.78s -> 6170.01s]  Why is he... He's right there with a gun and I
[6170.01s -> 6174.41s]  can't...
[6174.41s -> 6192.10s]  Fuck. You get... Where's the last guy?
[6192.10s -> 6193.38s]  Over here, right? Yeah, there's a
[6193.38s -> 6194.82s]  couple, right? Oh my god, I remember
[6194.82s -> 6196.42s]  this part. I remember being so scared
[6196.42s -> 6197.62s]  here.
[6197.62s -> 6198.90s]  I remember this part. I'm being
[6198.90s -> 6201.88s]  terrified. Is there no other way to
[6201.88s -> 6202.84s]  go? All right, there's
[6202.84s -> 6206.20s]  one guy with a Uzi and I can't get
[6206.20s -> 6207.48s]  there any other way. I have to bait
[6207.48s -> 6208.28s]  him.
[6208.28s -> 6218.46s]  Will he see me from here? I don't
[6218.46s -> 6219.42s]  have to run up there,
[6219.42s -> 6224.30s]  but I can't see.
[6224.63s -> 6227.11s]  Okay, just go! Done! Just fucking get out
[6227.11s -> 6228.63s]  of here. Get the hell out of here.
[6228.63s -> 6230.63s]  I'm not touching the girl. I'm not...
[6230.63s -> 6231.75s]  I'm not gonna...
[6231.75s -> 6234.15s]  Go, let go! Punch! Punch! No, no!
[6234.15s -> 6235.83s]  Why would I ever stay back? Yes, hold
[6235.83s -> 6237.59s]  right mouse button to skip.
[6237.59s -> 6239.27s]  Go, bye! Thank you for playing. I'll
[6239.27s -> 6240.23s]  see you later.
[6240.23s -> 6258.82s]  Get the fuck out of here. I forget
[6258.82s -> 6260.90s]  where I'm going. Where am I going?
[6260.90s -> 6264.86s]  Where's the car? Why did I park my
[6264.86s -> 6265.82s]  car?
[6265.82s -> 6274.86s]  All right, down here. Oh my god, thank
[6274.86s -> 6281.29s]  goodness.
[6281.29s -> 6282.57s]  I can't believe I had to do that
[6282.57s -> 6289.03s]  again.
[6289.03s -> 6297.98s]  How is that a D plus? I... I...
[6297.98s -> 6304.46s]  All right, I got Alex and Ash.
[6304.46s -> 6309.32s]  Didn't get any high combos. Damn it.
[6309.32s -> 6310.84s]  Down anytime soon. It's not a good
[6310.84s -> 6312.12s]  time to be messing around if a cop
[6312.12s -> 6314.28s]  came by. Sauce like this.
[6314.28s -> 6317.08s]  It ain't gonna go faster with you
[6317.08s -> 6318.92s]  bitching, okay? Besides, I've been
[6318.92s -> 6320.60s]  telling you to get the van fixed for
[6320.60s -> 6322.04s]  weeks.
[6322.04s -> 6323.40s]  Right, I still don't see any of that
[6323.40s -> 6325.64s]  be my job. It's not my van.
[6325.64s -> 6328.12s]  Just fucking do it.
[6328.20s -> 6330.36s]  The only one of us who ain't busy with
[6330.36s -> 6331.64s]  work all day.
[6331.64s -> 6333.72s]  Take it down to Andy and the chop shop.
[6333.72s -> 6335.64s]  He owes me one.
[6335.64s -> 6337.48s]  Fine, just get the car running and
[6337.48s -> 6338.84s]  I'll do it tomorrow, okay?
[6338.84s -> 6341.16s]  Yeah, that should do it. Try starting
[6341.16s -> 6342.76s]  her up and let's see what the hell's
[6342.76s -> 6344.76s]  had to happen in here.
[6344.76s -> 6349.37s]  This is my Stardew Valley character
[6349.37s -> 6350.57s]  all over again.
[6350.57s -> 6365.14s]  Am I like a... am I like a billionaire
[6365.14s -> 6366.10s]  apartment?
[6366.10s -> 6369.11s]  What's the matter? You look a little
[6369.11s -> 6372.07s]  nervous. Well, boss, something you need to
[6372.07s -> 6374.63s]  say, just say it. Look,
[6374.63s -> 6376.07s]  we've known each other for a long time
[6376.07s -> 6378.39s]  now. You've done a lot for me.
[6378.39s -> 6381.50s]  No need to be polite, cut to the point.
[6381.50s -> 6383.85s]  All right, I want out. I'm getting too
[6383.85s -> 6387.32s]  old for this. I'm feeling too soft.
[6387.32s -> 6389.48s]  Too soft? Too soft for what?
[6389.48s -> 6390.84s]  Shooting people, putting my ass on
[6390.84s -> 6392.44s]  the line. I've had a feeling I'm not
[6392.44s -> 6393.72s]  going to last much longer for a
[6393.72s -> 6394.52s]  while now.
[6394.52s -> 6397.50s]  Been having these dreams. Dreams, huh?
[6397.50s -> 6398.78s]  You want out? You're out.
[6398.78s -> 6400.38s]  But first, you have to take care of
[6400.38s -> 6403.26s]  some business for me, okay?
[6403.26s -> 6405.64s]  What business? Nothing big. A chop
[6405.64s -> 6407.86s]  shop downtown.
[6407.86s -> 6409.86s]  They're with the Colombians now. Won't
[6409.86s -> 6411.90s]  give us our cut no more.
[6411.90s -> 6414.14s]  Don't worry, they're just hoodlums.
[6414.14s -> 6416.09s]  Nothing you can't handle.
[6416.09s -> 6418.78s]  And then I'm out. Yes. Though you're
[6418.78s -> 6420.14s]  free to come back anytime you change
[6420.14s -> 6420.62s]  your mind.
[6420.62s -> 6422.28s]  As a parting gift, grab a sample of
[6422.28s -> 6426.41s]  our new product here. Might spice up
[6426.41s -> 6428.01s]  this new boring lifestyle you've
[6428.01s -> 6429.54s]  chosen.
[6429.54s -> 6431.22s]  Best voice acting ever? You want me
[6431.22s -> 6434.02s]  to go for it? Fine. Here you go.
[6434.02s -> 6438.39s]  Give me the next line. Give me the
[6438.39s -> 6448.52s]  next voice line. Well, there's no
[6448.52s -> 6449.48s]  more lines.
[6449.48s -> 6458.98s]  I don't get to take the eagle car,
[6458.98s -> 6460.36s]  whatever it is.
[6460.36s -> 6483.14s]  No mercy. Okay. Damn it!
[6483.14s -> 6491.62s]  I'm trying to go for- I'm trying to get
[6491.62s -> 6494.31s]  combos.
[6494.31s -> 6506.10s]  It's never gonna happen, okay? This
[6506.10s -> 6507.14s]  game is so
[6507.14s -> 6509.06s]  fucking fast-paced and so hard to
[6509.06s -> 6511.14s]  lose. It's so easy to lose.
[6511.14s -> 6512.34s]  Is there a skateboard on the ground?
[6512.34s -> 6525.83s]  What can I do with this? Oh.
[6525.83s -> 6527.03s]  You know how you get combos in this
[6527.03s -> 6528.23s]  game? You have to beat the level
[6528.23s -> 6530.15s]  like five times and like recognize
[6530.15s -> 6531.75s]  exactly where to go every- that's
[6531.75s -> 6532.87s]  where the combos come in.
[6532.87s -> 6534.55s]  You're gonna get a fucking D plus
[6534.55s -> 6535.91s]  on every mission.
[6535.91s -> 6538.87s]  Or a B. It's gonna happen every time
[6538.87s -> 6540.47s]  until you can sprint through and know
[6540.47s -> 6547.16s]  every kill and get like a 10 hit combo.
[6547.16s -> 6549.34s]  Really? What the fuck is that plywood
[6549.34s -> 6556.26s]  on the ground blocking?
[6556.26s -> 6558.74s]  Jesus god, give me a fucking break.
[6558.74s -> 6563.32s]  He's gonna shoot me through the
[6563.32s -> 6564.44s]  fucking glass. Look at all the glass
[6564.44s -> 6571.74s]  everywhere.
[6571.74s -> 6587.64s]  Jesus Christ! Oh come on.
[6587.64s -> 6589.66s]  Eat shit. That's enough time? That
[6589.66s -> 6590.78s]  gives me- that gives me enough time to
[6590.78s -> 6610.94s]  do this?
[6610.94s -> 6612.86s]  One guy over there. Is it that- is that
[6612.86s -> 6614.70s]  a bomb? What's this? Is that a bomb?
[6614.70s -> 6615.74s]  That looks like a wire that's
[6615.74s -> 6617.18s]  connected to a bomb.
[6617.18s -> 6634.73s]  Can you shoot through couches? Oh fucking
[6634.73s -> 6643.94s]  god. Jesus.
[6643.94s -> 6654.33s]  Last guy. Two guys. Got it. Okay. Good.
[6654.33s -> 6658.55s]  Floor cleared. Let's move.
[6658.55s -> 6670.26s]  Where's the next floor? Oh okay. So
[6670.26s -> 6671.70s]  it's just at the edge of the level.
[6671.70s -> 6677.69s]  You got it. All right, let's go.
[6677.69s -> 6679.05s]  Holy fuck! Where did you guys come
[6679.05s -> 6687.78s]  from? Down here? Oh shit, you did.
[6687.78s -> 6688.82s]  Damn, I didn't know you could shoot
[6688.82s -> 6701.51s]  over the car. I don't have enough
[6701.51s -> 6702.39s]  bullets for this.
[6702.39s -> 6707.27s]  I have enough of that and then I
[6707.27s -> 6708.47s]  gotta wait because I don't have any bullets.
[6708.47s -> 6709.83s]  So where the hell am I gonna go?
[6709.83s -> 6713.77s]  This way. Let's go to the left.
[6713.77s -> 6723.24s]  There's a lot? Okay. And there's a
[6723.56s -> 6725.16s]  where did the third fucking guy come
[6725.16s -> 6726.84s]  from? Find him.
[6726.84s -> 6729.96s]  Why was that guy here? What the heck?
[6729.96s -> 6731.48s]  Restart it. No, don't restart it. Just
[6731.48s -> 6734.23s]  die.
[6734.23s -> 6765.32s]  A third guy. Fucking glass.
[6765.32s -> 6777.45s]  Glass. All right, got it. Give me one
[6777.45s -> 6787.16s]  of your guns.
[6787.16s -> 6794.52s]  Glass him. Other side of the Pac-man
[6794.52s -> 6796.04s]  level here we go.
[6796.04s -> 6798.49s]  Ooh, that wasn't good. That wasn't
[6798.49s -> 6804.49s]  good either.
[6804.49s -> 6811.58s]  That wasn't good either. Panic! Panic!
[6811.58s -> 6831.14s]  Panic! Panic!
[6831.14s -> 6833.13s]  What the fuck shot me through the
[6833.13s -> 6839.66s]  glass?
[6839.66s -> 6841.34s]  Okay, can I, let me just be real for a
[6841.34s -> 6842.54s]  second.
[6842.54s -> 6843.82s]  Do you see where this motherfucker
[6843.82s -> 6846.23s]  shot me from? I was down here.
[6846.23s -> 6848.07s]  This guy shot through the glass over
[6848.07s -> 6849.62s]  the car.
[6849.62s -> 6851.78s]  Over the fucking disco machine.
[6851.78s -> 6852.98s]  The guy shot from across the whole
[6852.98s -> 6878.90s]  level.
[6878.90s -> 6898.23s]  I didn't shoot the dog. Relax. Dog.
[6898.23s -> 6899.59s]  Nobody up here. That's the guy that
[6899.59s -> 6912.18s]  shot me through the glass last time.
[6912.18s -> 6914.10s]  Glass? Anybody up there? Just check
[6914.10s -> 6914.98s]  to make sure I'm not gonna get shot
[6914.98s -> 6915.54s]  by somebody.
[6915.54s -> 6930.02s]  It's a glass shooter. Money? Can I
[6930.02s -> 6931.06s]  pick up the money?
[6931.06s -> 6938.55s]  Last guy up there. Dog. Fuck.
[6938.55s -> 6940.79s]  Good thing I saw that right when I did.
[6940.79s -> 6942.46s]  I'm just gonna wait for this guy.
[6942.46s -> 6947.21s]  I don't care if I lose points. Who's
[6947.21s -> 6948.09s]  left?
[6948.09s -> 6958.07s]  Don't just fucking sprint through. It's
[6958.07s -> 6960.31s]  not safe until everybody's dead.
[6960.31s -> 6963.10s]  Which I cannot guarantee I know where
[6963.10s -> 6965.18s]  they are. Okay, he's right there.
[6965.18s -> 6972.46s]  All right, good. Get the bag. The bag
[6972.46s -> 6973.66s]  of money?
[6973.66s -> 6976.20s]  Is that gonna be, is that a bomb? Is that a
[6976.20s -> 6977.56s]  bomb on the car? Okay, get me out of
[6977.56s -> 6990.34s]  here.
[6990.34s -> 6992.02s]  There's a bomb on the car. It's gonna
[6992.02s -> 6994.55s]  explode. I can't fuck around in
[6994.55s -> 6995.51s]  levels anymore guys. I don't know
[6995.51s -> 6996.55s]  which levels are gonna kill me or
[6996.55s -> 6997.19s]  not.
[6997.19s -> 7015.94s]  Well, who the hell are you? Thought you
[7015.94s -> 7017.54s]  could get away, huh?
[7017.54s -> 7021.56s]  Get away. I just work here. Who are you?
[7021.56s -> 7022.92s]  You're freaking me out, man.
[7022.92s -> 7024.57s]  It's your lucky day today, kid. This
[7024.57s -> 7026.09s]  bag here just saved your life.
[7026.09s -> 7027.05s]  I'm getting out of here. You should
[7027.05s -> 7028.54s]  probably do the same.
[7028.54s -> 7048.57s]  Now, out of my way! Voice acting.
[7048.57s -> 7050.81s]  Time bonus. Special. I'm not getting any
[7050.81s -> 7056.07s]  of those bonuses.
[7056.07s -> 7058.95s]  That was a C. I feel like I did
[7058.95s -> 7063.26s]  that one pretty quickly.
[7063.26s -> 7064.62s]  That one was, I felt like that one
[7064.62s -> 7065.98s]  was pretty good.
[7065.98s -> 7072.01s]  All right, here we are. Hi honey,
[7072.01s -> 7072.73s]  welcome home.
[7072.73s -> 7074.73s]  I made you dinner. It's in the fridge.
[7074.73s -> 7077.29s]  I'll eat it later. I'm not that hungry
[7077.29s -> 7078.17s]  right now.
[7078.17s -> 7081.14s]  Oh, had a rough day. All right, you want
[7081.14s -> 7082.10s]  me to be an actor?
[7082.10s -> 7085.46s]  Fine, I'll be an actor. I'm not sure.
[7085.46s -> 7089.88s]  I quit my job. You quit your job just
[7089.88s -> 7091.16s]  like that
[7091.16s -> 7092.76s]  and your boss just let you? I thought
[7092.76s -> 7094.28s]  you said,
[7094.28s -> 7096.36s]  look, I'm out and that's that. Speaking
[7096.36s -> 7097.32s]  of which,
[7097.32s -> 7100.94s]  I've got a surprise for you, but what
[7100.94s -> 7101.90s]  what is it?
[7101.90s -> 7104.41s]  You'll see tomorrow, okay? I'm
[7104.49s -> 7106.57s]  feeling a bit too tired right now.
[7106.57s -> 7108.73s]  I'm gonna head straight for bed. Are you
[7108.73s -> 7111.54s]  gonna stay up for a while?
[7111.54s -> 7112.98s]  I'm just gonna finish this show. I'll be
[7112.98s -> 7122.87s]  up in a minute.
[7122.87s -> 7124.78s]  Don't you know, acting guys, if
[7124.78s -> 7126.38s]  there's a question mark,
[7126.38s -> 7128.14s]  make it sound like a really big
[7128.14s -> 7130.62s]  question. Like, for instance,
[7130.62s -> 7133.58s]  acting class 101. If the
[7133.58s -> 7136.36s]  line is,
[7136.36s -> 7139.03s]  for instance,
[7139.03s -> 7140.71s]  did you go to the supermarket today?
[7140.71s -> 7142.39s]  Right? Did you go to the store
[7142.39s -> 7144.07s]  today? Did you go to the supermarket
[7144.07s -> 7144.87s]  today?
[7144.95s -> 7146.31s]  That's a guy with normal human talks,
[7146.31s -> 7148.23s]  right? But if you're, but an actor, but
[7148.23s -> 7149.45s]  acting,
[7149.45s -> 7152.39s]  did you go to the supermarket today?
[7152.39s -> 7154.55s]  Did you go to the supermarket today?
[7154.55s -> 7158.79s]  Did you go to the supermarket today?
[7158.79s -> 7160.31s]  Just, just talk like people don't
[7160.31s -> 7173.46s]  talk and you're an actor.
[7173.46s -> 7176.01s]  These pretzels are making me thirsty.
[7176.01s -> 7177.93s]  Yeah, instead of just saying,
[7177.93s -> 7179.21s]  these pretzels are drying me out.
[7179.21s -> 7180.01s]  You ever, do you have water or
[7180.01s -> 7181.61s]  something? These pretzels are really
[7181.61s -> 7182.57s]  drying my mouth out. Do you have any
[7182.57s -> 7183.85s]  water?
[7183.85s -> 7185.45s]  These pretzels are really drying my
[7185.45s -> 7187.45s]  mouth out. Do you have any water?
[7187.45s -> 7190.92s]  These pretzels are really dry. I mean,
[7190.92s -> 7193.26s]  these pretzels are really dry. These
[7193.26s -> 7195.02s]  pretzels are really dry.
[7195.02s -> 7203.90s]  That's how you be an actor. It's drying
[7203.90s -> 7210.70s]  me out.
[7210.70s -> 7213.75s]  Uh, all right. Okay, this is, this is
[7213.75s -> 7215.02s]  different.
[7215.02s -> 7216.94s]  I'm just driving away with money in
[7216.94s -> 7219.13s]  the bag.
[7219.13s -> 7220.33s]  You're listening, here you go, oh
[7220.33s -> 7222.97s]  right, by the way, actor is also radio
[7222.97s -> 7225.40s]  host or YouTuber.
[7225.40s -> 7228.12s]  You're listening to WYL Miami Radio,
[7228.12s -> 7229.96s]  bringing you fresh new music each
[7229.96s -> 7232.71s]  day.
[7232.71s -> 7234.47s]  What you like, whenever you like.
[7234.47s -> 7236.17s]  That's our motto.
[7236.17s -> 7238.09s]  It's a beautiful day today, the sun is
[7238.09s -> 7240.65s]  shining and the sky is clear.
[7240.65s -> 7242.01s]  Let me read that like a normal person
[7242.01s -> 7242.81s]  now.
[7242.81s -> 7244.97s]  You can't go wrong with weather like
[7244.97s -> 7246.65s]  this, that's for sure.
[7246.65s -> 7248.41s]  Later today we'll be premiering a
[7248.41s -> 7250.09s]  hot new single from, uh,
[7250.09s -> 7251.45s]  Perturberator.
[7251.45s -> 7253.21s]  Meanwhile, uh, here's another song by
[7253.21s -> 7254.49s]  everybody's favorite,
[7254.49s -> 7260.66s]  Mitch, see, acting. We interrupt the
[7260.66s -> 7262.42s]  broadcast for an emergency weather
[7262.42s -> 7263.38s]  report.
[7263.38s -> 7265.06s]  A tropical storm is heading towards
[7265.06s -> 7267.14s]  Florida, coming from the Atlantic.
[7267.14s -> 7269.14s]  It's estimated to reach Miami by 7
[7269.14s -> 7269.86s]  p.m.
[7269.86s -> 7276.14s]  We caution all residents to, my sky
[7276.14s -> 7276.94s]  got here,
[7276.94s -> 7279.90s]  where are we going? I'm going away, far
[7279.90s -> 7282.79s]  away, anywhere, it doesn't matter to me.
[7282.79s -> 7285.43s]  You sure, do you even know where
[7285.43s -> 7286.47s]  you're heading?
[7286.47s -> 7288.14s]  Well the directions, a lot of people
[7288.14s -> 7289.98s]  wind up going round in circles.
[7289.98s -> 7291.74s]  And this road doesn't look too
[7291.74s -> 7293.02s]  promising.
[7293.02s -> 7296.02s]  I didn't ask for your opinion. What if
[7296.02s -> 7297.46s]  I told you that this road leads to
[7297.46s -> 7298.34s]  nowhere,
[7298.34s -> 7300.84s]  or rather that you're heading for a
[7300.84s -> 7302.60s]  dead end, that's where you're going.
[7302.60s -> 7304.34s]  You're closing in on it, it's closing in
[7304.34s -> 7305.46s]  fast,
[7305.54s -> 7307.91s]  but you already know that, don't you? I
[7307.91s -> 7310.07s]  have no idea what you're talking about.
[7310.07s -> 7314.31s]  You'll see soon enough. By the way, did
[7314.31s -> 7315.83s]  you forget to bring your girlfriend?
[7321.13s -> 7322.49s]  Caught the lesson I was giving you
[7322.49s -> 7324.17s]  there, I was being a fucking real
[7324.17s -> 7325.37s]  actor on the chicken,
[7325.37s -> 7326.89s]  and I was being an actor on the
[7326.89s -> 7337.27s]  fucking, the other guy, the driver.
[7337.27s -> 7343.03s]  Mary? Mary? Mary? Fucking Garfield on
[7343.03s -> 7343.91s]  the couch.
[7343.91s -> 7345.83s]  How do you guys pick up shit like
[7345.83s -> 7347.83s]  that, so quickly?
[7347.83s -> 7352.26s]  There's a note. Hi honey, I'm sorry, I'm
[7352.26s -> 7354.02s]  not doing the acting thing anymore.
[7354.02s -> 7357.06s]  Hi honey, I'm so sorry about this.
[7357.06s -> 7358.42s]  You would have done the same thing if
[7358.42s -> 7359.70s]  you were me.
[7359.70s -> 7367.50s]  Love, Mary. He does it anyways, yeah
[7367.50s -> 7368.06s]  whatever.
[7368.06s -> 7382.15s]  This is called Execution. Okay, you
[7382.15s -> 7383.67s]  have reached the wrong number.
[7383.67s -> 7385.91s]  That's the title of the game. Please
[7385.91s -> 7386.87s]  hang up and try again.
[7386.87s -> 7390.49s]  Beep beep. Listen to that baseline.
[7390.49s -> 7392.01s]  This is a good baseline. Oh hey, hold
[7392.01s -> 7392.81s]  on.
[7392.81s -> 7399.45s]  Chainsaw and guns. What the hell is
[7399.45s -> 7402.98s]  this?
[7402.98s -> 7404.58s]  What the fuck? Hold on, you get your own
[7404.58s -> 7405.78s]  ice climbers?
[7405.78s -> 7411.35s]  How does this work? What the fuck? Oh my
[7411.35s -> 7415.90s]  god, it really is the ice climbers.
[7415.90s -> 7420.94s]  Oh, whoa, this is weird. Okay,
[7420.94s -> 7422.14s]  this is kind of cool. I kind of like
[7422.14s -> 7448.55s]  this. Who's left?
[7448.55s -> 7458.86s]  One guy over here. I thought that was a
[7458.86s -> 7460.22s]  guy. Okay, no we're good.
[7460.22s -> 7468.17s]  I can't go in there? I guess not.
[7468.17s -> 7470.89s]  All right, so how do I pick up other
[7470.89s -> 7471.61s]  guns
[7471.61s -> 7476.23s]  with the, uh, what is it? What are the
[7476.23s -> 7478.23s]  names of the ice climbers names?
[7478.23s -> 7494.58s]  Does he reload? Do I have to, I think
[7494.58s -> 7495.54s]  I have to pick up the guns on the
[7495.54s -> 7496.74s]  ground, right?
[7496.74s -> 7512.63s]  Yeah, there we go, okay. Fuck, I had it.
[7512.63s -> 7527.88s]  Okay, I, I, I understand. That's it.
[7527.88s -> 7533.37s]  No, I want to pick up, I can't pick up
[7533.37s -> 7534.81s]  the other guns, okay.
[7534.81s -> 7539.98s]  All right, grab this other gun on the
[7539.98s -> 7543.53s]  ground over here. Got it, okay.
[7543.53s -> 7553.27s]  One guy left. Right through the front
[7553.27s -> 7556.84s]  door.
[7556.84s -> 7566.94s]  No, in there.
[7567.02s -> 7570.74s]  Oh, these guys are fun. Oh, these
[7570.74s -> 7572.34s]  guys are really fun.
[7572.34s -> 7581.96s]  Can I do anything else? Oh, I wake up
[7581.96s -> 7582.68s]  here. Wait,
[7582.68s -> 7593.16s]  oh, I have to go in there? Look, I don't
[7593.16s -> 7593.72s]  know.
[7593.72s -> 7596.20s]  I told you. There's something strange
[7596.20s -> 7597.96s]  going on, you know what I mean?
[7597.96s -> 7599.24s]  Can you see that? Look right there. Can
[7599.24s -> 7600.78s]  you see it? What is that?
[7600.78s -> 7601.82s]  Someone must have slipped me
[7601.82s -> 7602.78s]  something. I mean, this can't be
[7602.78s -> 7603.58s]  happening.
[7603.58s -> 7605.26s]  It's like, wow, are those masks? Are
[7605.26s -> 7607.02s]  we in the jungle? I want to go to
[7607.02s -> 7608.30s]  the jungle. I quit. You know, did I
[7608.30s -> 7609.02s]  tell you that?
[7609.02s -> 7610.22s]  No more, I tell you. I'm out. Done.
[7610.22s -> 7616.44s]  Finished. Holy shit.
[7616.44s -> 7618.36s]  What? Are you hitting me? I just want
[7618.36s -> 7620.28s]  to go home. Can you call Mary? She'll,
[7620.28s -> 7621.91s]  she'll come get me.
[7621.91s -> 7623.03s]  Am I bleeding? Do I need to go to
[7623.03s -> 7624.46s]  the hospital?
[7624.46s -> 7640.68s]  Guys, I just want to go home. Holy shit.
[7640.68s -> 7645.96s]  That was a little, that's too bad.
[7645.96s -> 7654.87s]  All right, we got
[7654.87s -> 7658.86s]  B minus. That's right. I'm gonna,
[7658.86s -> 7660.62s]  I'm gonna march
[7660.62s -> 7663.50s]  back home with that in my hand,
[7663.50s -> 7664.70s]  and I'm gonna be playing
[7664.70s -> 7666.62s]  fucking show tunes in my head,
[7666.62s -> 7668.38s]  while I march back to fucking hold it
[7668.38s -> 7670.14s]  in front of me to show bomb.
[7670.14s -> 7671.42s]  That's, I'm opening the door with it
[7671.42s -> 7679.78s]  out in front, holding it out.
[7679.78s -> 7689.80s]  Mark. Third act, climax. Climax.
[7689.80s -> 7695.72s]  I don't know if it's the heat, but I
[7695.72s -> 7697.75s]  feel a bit drunk.
[7697.75s -> 7699.19s]  Me too, I'm thinking about heading back
[7699.19s -> 7700.47s]  to camp.
[7700.47s -> 7704.39s]  I'm good for another round or two. You
[7704.39s -> 7705.43s]  guys head on back.
[7705.43s -> 7707.82s]  I'll catch up with you later. You don't
[7707.82s -> 7709.42s]  tell me what to do, okay?
[7709.42s -> 7710.78s]  I'm gonna show you how to drink, you
[7710.78s -> 7712.22s]  hear me?
[7712.22s -> 7714.38s]  Well, I guess we'll see you guys back
[7714.38s -> 7715.18s]  at camp then.
[7715.18s -> 7716.94s]  Just remember that we have a job to
[7716.94s -> 7718.30s]  do tonight, fellas.
[7718.30s -> 7729.18s]  Okay. Excuse me guys, you have a
[7729.18s -> 7731.18s]  second? I'd like to get a picture of
[7731.18s -> 7732.78s]  you if you don't mind.
[7732.78s -> 7735.58s]  Sure thing. Could you send me a copy
[7735.58s -> 7737.26s]  if I give you my address?
[7737.26s -> 7739.66s]  No need, we have a Polaroid. Would you
[7739.66s -> 7741.34s]  mind stepping out into the sun here for
[7741.34s -> 7749.72s]  a bit?
[7749.72s -> 7752.26s]  Uh, do I have to do something? No, no.
[7752.26s -> 7753.38s]  All right, good luck out there, guys.
[7753.38s -> 7755.46s]  Thanks for letting me get a shot.
[7755.46s -> 7757.22s]  No worries, man. Good luck to you too.
[7757.22s -> 7771.53s]  Okay. Now what? Why is the world
[7771.53s -> 7772.41s]  spinning?
[7772.41s -> 7787.42s]  Uh, oh, I had to take the Polaroid.
[7787.42s -> 7788.94s]  Okay, are we
[7788.94s -> 7790.70s]  trying to move out? Choose your
[7790.70s -> 7791.82s]  weapon wisely and make
[7791.82s -> 7795.42s]  them shots count. Lord knows how many-
[7795.42s -> 7797.42s]  So, are we at like war? I don't
[7797.42s -> 7798.46s]  understand.
[7799.29s -> 7801.29s]  Do be careful, my boy. Don't want any of
[7801.29s -> 7805.64s]  my men dying on me.
[7805.64s -> 7807.16s]  Got a special delivery coming in
[7807.16s -> 7808.92s]  tonight. Wouldn't want to drink all that
[7808.92s -> 7809.80s]  bourbon alone.
[7809.80s -> 7813.08s]  Not in this goddamn place. Uh,
[7813.08s -> 7816.20s]  I'm gonna say shotgun. No. Yeah. Well,
[7816.20s -> 7818.98s]  I have to use it now.
[7818.98s -> 7829.53s]  Okay. So, I can't put it down.
[7829.53s -> 7832.57s]  Ambush. What the hell is happening
[7832.57s -> 7842.84s]  in this game?
[7842.84s -> 7844.68s]  What the hell is this? All right,
[7844.68s -> 7845.88s]  we're-
[7845.88s -> 7858.22s]  Okay. Good thing you didn't look that
[7858.22s -> 7859.26s]  way.
[7859.26s -> 7869.40s]  Oh, I can take a knife out. So, I can't
[7869.40s -> 7870.60s]  pick weapons up off the ground in these
[7870.60s -> 7878.38s]  levels. All right. Whatever.
[7878.38s -> 7888.41s]  Area clear. Can I reload?
[7888.41s -> 7891.21s]  Not conserving ammo. Oh, shit. Oh, all
[7891.21s -> 7906.22s]  right. I'll conserve ammo.
[7906.22s -> 7924.42s]  Caught him. Caught him. Really? All
[7924.42s -> 7925.94s]  right. Conserving ammo.
[7925.94s -> 7932.01s]  How does that guy not shoot me? I
[7932.01s -> 7933.21s]  don't know. All right. Let me pay
[7933.21s -> 7934.25s]  attention.
[7934.25s -> 7937.91s]  Can this guy shoot over this? Oh,
[7937.91s -> 7939.51s]  conserving ammo.
[7939.51s -> 7943.82s]  Aye, aye, aye. Nobody down. Okay.
[7943.82s -> 7949.67s]  Just don't worry about this guy here.
[7949.67s -> 7951.51s]  Put down there. I'm gonna have to shoot
[7951.51s -> 7952.55s]  that guy, aren't I?
[7952.55s -> 7967.53s]  I have to shoot this guy. Well, fuck.
[7967.53s -> 7977.93s]  Is that-
[7977.93s -> 7982.07s]  Is this ammo boxes? Where are they?
[7982.07s -> 7996.14s]  Are there any ammo boxes here? Shoot
[7996.14s -> 8000.09s]  the last round.
[8000.09s -> 8009.51s]  Shoot once. Okay. Get ammo. Okay.
[8009.51s -> 8014.78s]  There we go. Look, we're fine. I
[8014.78s -> 8016.22s]  didn't get- I got played. I would have
[8016.22s -> 8018.14s]  been so upset that way. Okay.
[8018.14s -> 8023.75s]  Were you guys trying to bait me and it
[8023.75s -> 8032.70s]  actually worked out in my favor?
[8032.70s -> 8033.90s]  Oh, damn it. That would have been like
[8033.90s -> 8035.02s]  10 combo there.
[8035.02s -> 8041.94s]  Oops-a-daisy. Who the fuck am I?
[8041.94s -> 8046.47s]  What? What? Okay.
[8046.47s -> 8075.10s]  Okay, that was stupid. All right. We got
[8075.10s -> 8076.70s]  guy with the gun, guy with the blade.
[8076.70s -> 8085.86s]  Guy with the gun first. Bingo. Bingo!
[8085.86s -> 8087.70s]  James here. I'm done, uh, weeding out
[8087.70s -> 8088.98s]  the garden. How's it going with the
[8088.98s -> 8090.25s]  yard?
[8090.25s -> 8091.93s]  Hank here. I ran out of fuel for the
[8091.93s -> 8094.90s]  lawn mowers. We're at the gas station.
[8094.90s -> 8095.94s]  Headed over and we'll share the
[8095.94s -> 8100.46s]  ride back. I'll leave the area.
[8100.46s -> 8102.82s]  I don't think I can do anything else
[8102.82s -> 8103.62s]  here, so
[8103.62s -> 8111.30s]  mine will just go. That had to have been
[8111.30s -> 8114.28s]  pretty good. I- that's gonna be at least
[8114.28s -> 8120.94s]  a B.
[8120.94s -> 8127.43s]  I'll take a B minus. Better than
[8127.43s -> 8129.24s]  expected.
[8129.24s -> 8131.64s]  I'm even prouder to show that to mom.
[8131.64s -> 8135.19s]  Mom doesn't expect me to get aids.
[8135.19s -> 8149.27s]  Weapon unlocked big and heavy. Hmm.
[8149.27s -> 8151.35s]  Looks like he- we got our hands on
[8151.35s -> 8152.79s]  some good intel here.
[8152.79s -> 8154.15s]  We should get this back to the
[8154.15s -> 8156.07s]  Colonel as soon as possible. Not sure
[8156.07s -> 8157.35s]  what to do with the captives,
[8157.35s -> 8159.11s]  though. Maybe we should just let
[8159.11s -> 8161.59s]  Barnes have his way. Would make the
[8161.59s -> 8162.15s]  jog
[8162.15s -> 8167.38s]  back to camp a hell of a lot easier.
[8167.38s -> 8168.82s]  This is the- this is- we're watching a
[8168.82s -> 8170.10s]  movie right now.
[8170.10s -> 8173.38s]  Oh, pause it right there. Oh, hold on a
[8173.38s -> 8175.80s]  second. You're trying to tell me
[8175.80s -> 8180.97s]  that a Bluetooth brush. Uh, all right.
[8180.97s -> 8191.27s]  Did you guys catch the news on
[8191.27s -> 8192.87s]  channel six last night? Looks like
[8192.87s -> 8196.70s]  we're famous now.
[8196.70s -> 8198.14s]  Yeah, looks like we got our five
[8198.14s -> 8200.06s]  minutes of fame. I'd say it was
[8200.06s -> 8202.49s]  more like two.
[8202.49s -> 8203.85s]  Damn, I didn't catch it. What did
[8203.85s -> 8204.97s]  they say?
[8204.97s -> 8206.41s]  Do you think you can call the news
[8206.41s -> 8208.09s]  station and ask for a copy?
[8208.09s -> 8210.71s]  I mean, I'd pay big bucks to see it.
[8210.71s -> 8211.83s]  Why don't you call the police and
[8211.83s -> 8214.02s]  turn yourself in while you're at it?
[8214.02s -> 8215.38s]  Yeah, that probably would be a good
[8215.38s -> 8217.46s]  idea. I'm sure they'll run another
[8217.46s -> 8219.62s]  story on us sooner or later anyway.
[8219.62s -> 8221.14s]  I'm not so sure about that we'd have
[8221.14s -> 8224.41s]  to off more people first, you know?
[8224.41s -> 8225.85s]  He's right. Not sure what to do
[8225.85s -> 8227.61s]  about that. We can't just go out and
[8227.61s -> 8230.01s]  kill random people now, can we?
[8230.01s -> 8232.33s]  I might have an idea. I bought- hold
[8232.33s -> 8233.21s]  on.
[8233.21s -> 8237.00s]  I can't do Donald Duck. I bought
[8237.00s -> 8238.92s]  some weed from a couple of
[8238.92s -> 8254.14s]  creeps a few days ago.
[8254.14s -> 8270.66s]  Okay. He's choking.
[8270.66s -> 8273.38s]  He wants to go treasure hunting for more
[8273.38s -> 8277.16s]  drugs.
[8277.16s -> 8278.68s]  No, I can't. I don't know how people do
[8278.68s -> 8280.04s]  Donald Duck. It's fucking hard.
[8280.04s -> 8281.40s]  Well, there might be more assholes
[8281.40s -> 8283.48s]  there. I don't know. You got
[8283.48s -> 8284.68s]  anything better to do?
[8284.68s -> 8285.88s]  I wouldn't mind going for a ride.
[8285.88s -> 8288.30s]  Let's check it out. We could always
[8288.30s -> 8289.90s]  grab some pizza if we don't find
[8289.90s -> 8295.29s]  anything.
[8295.29s -> 8296.33s]  Yeah, there's one thing of being
[8296.33s -> 8298.41s]  able to do a duck, like
[8298.41s -> 8301.05s]  blah, blah, you know what I'm talking
[8301.05s -> 8301.69s]  about.
[8301.69s -> 8303.77s]  But being able to form words in a
[8303.77s -> 8305.05s]  coherent sentence,
[8305.05s -> 8307.45s]  as the Donald Duck voice, is so hard to
[8307.45s -> 8309.13s]  do. Two machine guns.
[8309.13s -> 8310.33s]  I'm staying with these two. These two
[8310.33s -> 8315.78s]  are fun.
[8315.78s -> 8323.37s]  Leave or die. The back? No, no, no, no,
[8323.37s -> 8324.17s]  no, no.
[8324.17s -> 8328.22s]  Okay. I cased the joint successfully.
[8328.22s -> 8343.29s]  Let's go. Right into his gut. That's
[8343.29s -> 8343.93s]  it.
[8343.93s -> 8352.70s]  Done. Whoa. That's all there was to
[8352.70s -> 8353.42s]  it, huh?
[8353.42s -> 8357.37s]  Did you hear that? Hear what? Sounds
[8357.37s -> 8358.81s]  like someone's in that room over
[8358.81s -> 8361.19s]  there. I already checked it. There's
[8361.19s -> 8366.92s]  no one in there.
[8366.92s -> 8372.38s]  Oops. Okay. Well, we're going down even
[8372.38s -> 8375.29s]  further.
[8375.29s -> 8376.65s]  I don't understand these walls. Are these
[8376.65s -> 8378.57s]  walls? Not really.
[8378.57s -> 8387.88s]  Okay. Well, I didn't get it. Okay.
[8387.88s -> 8388.76s]  That's
[8388.76s -> 8398.14s]  three. Shit. I missed.
[8398.14s -> 8405.96s]  Come on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
[8405.96s -> 8407.24s]  Bring it on. What we got? Guy with the
[8407.24s -> 8408.12s]  gun?
[8408.12s -> 8417.11s]  That's no problem for me. Keep going.
[8417.11s -> 8417.99s]  Fast. Hurry up.
[8417.99s -> 8449.70s]  A plus. Let's go. Weee. Don't go crazy
[8449.70s -> 8451.54s]  here.
[8451.54s -> 8453.94s]  I fucking, my own partner just shot me
[8453.94s -> 8454.82s]  in the head. That's what it looked
[8454.82s -> 8455.46s]  like.
[8455.46s -> 8461.66s]  I'm trying to rush. What the fuck
[8461.66s -> 8462.54s]  happened there?
[8462.54s -> 8471.00s]  Give me a fucking break. How did he not
[8471.00s -> 8489.61s]  get shot by that?
[8489.61s -> 8491.61s]  Damn it. Trying to focus too much on
[8491.61s -> 8492.41s]  the shooting.
[8492.41s -> 8496.15s]  The shooting is the backup
[8496.15s -> 8497.96s]  to me.
[8497.96s -> 8499.48s]  I was right clicking and it
[8499.48s -> 8509.38s]  wouldn't shoot.
[8509.38s -> 8517.99s]  Okay. Relax. Seven bullets. Okay.
[8517.99s -> 8519.59s]  Dog. Don't forget about the dog. All
[8519.59s -> 8521.11s]  right. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[8521.11s -> 8530.89s]  Good. Holy fuck. I almost missed. It's
[8530.89s -> 8532.41s]  okay. Anybody else?
[8532.41s -> 8534.17s]  Guy down there. He's melee. Just drag
[8534.17s -> 8541.24s]  him up.
[8541.24s -> 8553.10s]  Shit. Okay. Whoops. Whoops.
[8553.10s -> 8574.60s]  I got one. Fuck. No. God damn it.
[8574.60s -> 8576.12s]  What the hell?
[8576.12s -> 8584.74s]  This bullshit. Come on, man.
[8584.74s -> 8587.22s]  That was such dog shit. He just like
[8587.22s -> 8587.70s]  fucking
[8587.70s -> 8592.33s]  insta-turned. I'm so fucking mad about
[8592.33s -> 8593.13s]  that one.
[8593.13s -> 8602.63s]  I wasn't even paying attention. Missed
[8602.63s -> 8603.99s]  the chance.
[8603.99s -> 8622.86s]  Another dog, right? I'm surprised that
[8622.86s -> 8624.22s]  didn't get it.
[8624.22s -> 8636.28s]  Get that gun. Pick it up. Pick up the
[8636.28s -> 8638.70s]  gun. Is there a reason why you won't
[8638.70s -> 8639.66s]  pick the gun up?
[8639.66s -> 8641.96s]  There you go. Okay. Jeez. I guess he
[8641.96s -> 8643.64s]  does it himself. Okay.
[8643.64s -> 8659.82s]  Nobody else up there, right? Just this
[8659.82s -> 8666.02s]  guy with the gun. Down. Down. Down.
[8666.02s -> 8667.46s]  Down. Down. Who's down here?
[8667.46s -> 8671.64s]  Okay. Same deal. I just gotta shoot that
[8671.64s -> 8672.44s]  guy.
[8672.44s -> 8688.01s]  He's in such an awkward spot too.
[8688.01s -> 8700.42s]  Okay. Fine. Bye. Faster. Hurry. Hurry.
[8700.42s -> 8704.25s]  Hurry. Go to the car. I'm going faster.
[8704.25s -> 8714.36s]  Secret. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster.
[8714.36s -> 8715.72s]  I'm going. I'm trying.
[8715.72s -> 8725.50s]  I got some pretty decent combo. I got
[8725.50s -> 8726.94s]  like it almost times nine times
[8726.94s -> 8730.57s]  ten.
[8730.57s -> 8738.07s]  Small time bonus. It's okay. Got it.
[8738.07s -> 8749.05s]  A minus. Boomer speedrun strats. That's
[8749.05s -> 8750.65s]  called a regular strat.
[8750.65s -> 8753.78s]  Good strat. Does this change? Change
[8753.78s -> 8757.56s]  perspective so many times in this game.
[8757.56s -> 8759.90s]  Who is it? It's the police. Open the
[8759.90s -> 8760.87s]  door.
[8760.87s -> 8762.07s]  Fifty second. I gotta put on some
[8762.07s -> 8771.42s]  clothes. Okay. Wait. That was the duck.
[8771.42s -> 8781.94s]  That's the duck costume. Police are
[8781.94s -> 8786.82s]  already in here.
[8786.82s -> 8800.44s]  Can I go in the car? Okay. Who is
[8800.44s -> 8808.78s]  that?
[8808.78s -> 8810.84s]  How did you get in here? The door
[8810.84s -> 8812.04s]  wasn't locked. I let myself in. I hope
[8812.04s -> 8812.92s]  you don't mind.
[8812.92s -> 8823.72s]  Blind. Blind streamer. What are you
[8823.72s -> 8824.36s]  talking about?
[8824.36s -> 8826.98s]  Well what do you want? I'm looking for an
[8826.98s -> 8828.26s]  Ash Davis.
[8828.26s -> 8829.94s]  This is listed as his last known
[8829.94s -> 8832.86s]  address. Well as you can see he's not
[8832.86s -> 8834.30s]  here. I don't know where he is.
[8834.30s -> 8835.98s]  He doesn't live here anymore. Was there
[8835.98s -> 8841.16s]  anything else? Will you tell him to
[8841.16s -> 8844.76s]  contact Miami PD next time you see him?
[8844.76s -> 8846.28s]  You're his sister aren't you? I can
[8846.28s -> 8848.04s]  see you got the good genes.
[8848.04s -> 8850.73s]  You're very pretty. If there was nothing
[8850.73s -> 8853.45s]  else I would like for you to leave.
[8853.45s -> 8858.55s]  Now I have to take it.
[8858.55s -> 8860.89s]  I'm just switching control. Who's the
[8860.89s -> 8867.59s]  protagonist in this game?
[8867.67s -> 8874.58s]  Dead ahead. Oh that's interesting.
[8874.58s -> 8876.82s]  So I gotta pee. We're taking our
[8876.82s -> 8878.26s]  first break in the night. I'll be
[8878.26s -> 8879.14s]  right back.
[8879.14s -> 8887.05s]  Pee time. Sorry for the static. I'll
[8887.05s -> 8887.85s]  mute it.
[8887.85s -> 9047.24s]  All right be right back. You know what
[9047.24s -> 9049.24s]  might think would be funny?
[9049.24s -> 9052.92s]  If I use this
[9052.92s -> 9054.36s]  on every view right back and the new
[9054.36s -> 9055.96s]  viewers just have no fucking idea
[9055.96s -> 9058.94s]  what's happening.
[9058.94s -> 9071.45s]  What my cam's on? Oh okay. I've
[9071.45s -> 9072.73s]  refreshed the page and I had no
[9072.73s -> 9075.88s]  idea what was going on.
[9075.88s -> 9082.18s]  Uh all right we're back.
[9082.18s -> 9083.62s]  And by the way hold on let me just open
[9083.62s -> 9086.95s]  up this uh
[9086.95s -> 9096.94s]  fresh beer. Coors light.
[9096.94s -> 9100.86s]  Now you are a boomer. It's I'm drink
[9100.86s -> 9102.38s]  it's a coca cola. It's just a
[9102.38s -> 9106.04s]  fucking coke.
[9106.04s -> 9107.56s]  Is it monster? Why would I drink a
[9107.56s -> 9109.74s]  monster energy drink?
[9109.74s -> 9110.94s]  What the hell would I ever do that
[9110.94s -> 9120.28s]  for? What? Wait what's down here?
[9120.28s -> 9129.40s]  This is like really this is like
[9129.40s -> 9131.08s]  really thick coke though.
[9131.08s -> 9132.68s]  Like this is this supposed to be like
[9132.68s -> 9133.64s]  this?
[9133.64s -> 9145.13s]  You know what I mean? Chewy. Is this
[9145.13s -> 9146.41s]  supposed to be chewy?
[9146.41s -> 9159.30s]  That's weird. What the fuck happened?
[9159.30s -> 9162.33s]  What? What character am I? Oh it's me
[9162.33s -> 9163.37s]  right there.
[9163.37s -> 9169.34s]  Come on keep it up. Keep it up. Come
[9169.34s -> 9171.62s]  on. Keep up the punch.
[9171.62s -> 9189.64s]  Wow. My god. Fucking guy with a
[9189.64s -> 9210.71s]  machine gun.
[9210.71s -> 9214.66s]  Hmm I got an idea. Come over here.
[9214.66s -> 9222.89s]  You god come over here. And you hit
[9222.89s -> 9224.01s]  me behind a wall.
[9224.01s -> 9225.13s]  I'm trying to bait that guy. Why
[9225.13s -> 9228.09s]  would the guys look at me?
[9228.09s -> 9229.69s]  Just staring at me and he just won't come
[9229.69s -> 9231.18s]  over here.
[9231.18s -> 9242.82s]  You fucking dummy. All right get the
[9242.82s -> 9251.74s]  fuck over here.
[9251.74s -> 9257.21s]  You. You come over here. Okay who's left?
[9257.21s -> 9258.57s]  That guy. That guy. That guy. I gotta
[9258.57s -> 9261.88s]  throw.
[9261.88s -> 9263.48s]  How the hell am I gonna do this? I
[9263.48s -> 9266.82s]  gotta go up to here.
[9266.82s -> 9270.15s]  Gun. Who's first? This guy right
[9270.15s -> 9271.11s]  here.
[9271.11s -> 9275.03s]  Oh and I right clicked.
[9275.03s -> 9296.20s]  Yeah um why is it going over him?
[9296.20s -> 9302.12s]  What the fuck is happening? I don't
[9302.12s -> 9303.08s]  know.
[9303.08s -> 9306.30s]  He's. They're ducking. I get it. I
[9306.30s -> 9307.58s]  understand. I get it. I get it. Everybody
[9307.58s -> 9308.70s]  watch it.
[9308.70s -> 9313.82s]  I get it. Stand up. Gotcha.
[9313.82s -> 9316.86s]  Fuck. I have one bullet. Oh that's not
[9316.86s -> 9320.44s]  good.
[9320.44s -> 9323.64s]  Oh I can't. I can't duck.
[9323.64s -> 9339.11s]  This is a fun game. You know what? Dude I don't know how the hell
[9339.11s -> 9342.55s]  you could beat this in 10 seconds.
[9342.55s -> 9344.63s]  You gotta be real damn good at
[9344.63s -> 9345.67s]  this.
[9345.67s -> 9349.61s]  Don't want to. This guy's gonna
[9349.61s -> 9351.37s]  collapse on me if I don't take him out
[9351.37s -> 9351.85s]  right now.
[9351.85s -> 9354.17s]  Almost died again. All right here we go.
[9354.17s -> 9356.17s]  I gotta get a better spot. I like this
[9356.17s -> 9357.61s]  spot up here.
[9357.61s -> 9359.05s]  Because it's near more guns. I can get
[9359.05s -> 9361.96s]  this guy while being blocked.
[9361.96s -> 9365.16s]  You fucking stupid video game. Who even
[9365.16s -> 9366.36s]  plays these anymore?
[9366.36s -> 9367.48s]  Who even plays these anymore?
[9367.48s -> 9373.53s]  Seriously. Fucking video games right?
[9373.53s -> 9389.67s]  Like oh why why would you play them?
[9389.67s -> 9391.03s]  You gotta be kidding me. Who even
[9391.03s -> 9410.89s]  fucking plays them anymore?
[9410.89s -> 9418.01s]  Who even fucking plays them? See me.
[9418.01s -> 9427.80s]  All right. Oh boomer rage.
[9427.80s -> 9430.28s]  Why did he not stand up and his friend
[9430.28s -> 9432.62s]  underneath him did?
[9432.62s -> 9435.10s]  He has a clear shot and he doesn't
[9435.10s -> 9442.50s]  stand up but the other guy does.
[9442.50s -> 9444.02s]  I can't even hit the first guy
[9444.02s -> 9449.26s]  anymore.
[9449.26s -> 9455.27s]  I'm so fucking angry at this.
[9455.27s -> 9456.47s]  They don't make video games like
[9456.47s -> 9457.83s]  they used to. Remember how easy they
[9457.83s -> 9460.02s]  used to be?
[9460.02s -> 9463.14s]  Do you remember? God I missed like
[9463.14s -> 9465.86s]  the golden age of video games.
[9465.86s -> 9469.30s]  Remember back? Remember Mega Man 4?
[9469.30s -> 9472.26s]  You remember that one? Yeah I do.
[9472.26s -> 9473.86s]  Yeah I remember being unbearable and
[9473.86s -> 9475.70s]  almost unplayably difficult.
[9475.70s -> 9477.21s]  And you had to start the whole game
[9477.21s -> 9478.49s]  over again if you lost like three
[9478.49s -> 9479.29s]  times.
[9479.29s -> 9480.92s]  Remember that video game used to be
[9480.92s -> 9487.10s]  so much easier?
[9487.10s -> 9497.88s]  Oh my god. I remember Castlevania.
[9497.88s -> 9501.74s]  That was such a fucking fun game. I
[9501.74s -> 9503.48s]  loved having
[9503.48s -> 9505.80s]  one item to attack with and and get
[9505.80s -> 9507.64s]  you get bounced around.
[9507.64s -> 9511.78s]  Hey remember Donkey Kong Country? That
[9511.78s -> 9513.30s]  game was fucking... Remember how awesome
[9513.30s -> 9514.42s]  that game was?
[9514.42s -> 9516.58s]  Hey go play one of the bounce around
[9516.58s -> 9517.86s]  and the barrels levels and you tell
[9517.86s -> 9520.46s]  me how great that game is.
[9520.46s -> 9523.02s]  Get past like the second world in
[9523.02s -> 9524.22s]  Donkey Kong Country and then you
[9524.22s -> 9525.58s]  tell me
[9525.58s -> 9553.50s]  if games used to be fucking easy.
[9553.50s -> 9561.94s]  Yeah!
[9561.94s -> 9563.94s]  Wowee! Where'd you come from? Oh wowee!
[9563.94s -> 9565.22s]  Is that like my new fucking catch
[9565.22s -> 9566.34s]  phrase?
[9566.34s -> 9567.86s]  Did you... is that as you pull the
[9567.86s -> 9569.14s]  cord on my back and that's what I
[9569.14s -> 9570.44s]  say?
[9570.44s -> 9574.68s]  I have four phrases.
[9574.68s -> 9582.46s]  Wowee!
[9582.46s -> 9589.48s]  What the hell?
[9589.48s -> 9608.97s]  Suck a fart out of my ass!
[9608.97s -> 9610.73s]  Dude I keep forgetting that's not a...
[9610.73s -> 9612.49s]  this is not a wall right here. I keep
[9612.49s -> 9613.37s]  thinking it is.
[9613.37s -> 9623.03s]  Sprint sprint sprint sprint sprint
[9623.03s -> 9624.79s]  sprint sprint oh no don't sprint.
[9624.79s -> 9634.54s]  All right there's a there's a spot
[9634.54s -> 9635.42s]  right here that I'm not gonna get
[9635.42s -> 9637.10s]  shot because I can walk past that.
[9637.10s -> 9638.54s]  All right so easy now. This is a
[9638.54s -> 9639.82s]  safe zone.
[9639.82s -> 9646.46s]  Why don't you come over here? After three
[9646.46s -> 9654.60s]  attempts I finally got the gun.
[9654.60s -> 9656.28s]  And if you miss don't worry you always
[9656.28s -> 9657.88s]  get a second chance. All right what
[9657.88s -> 9669.88s]  is left in here? Oh my god I almost just
[9669.88s -> 9670.60s]  didn't...
[9670.60s -> 9677.14s]  okay. Stage clear. Fast one two three
[9677.14s -> 9690.14s]  go!
[9690.14s -> 9713.96s]  You fucking dummy. All right who's left?
[9713.96s -> 9716.20s]  What the fuck was that guy? Where was
[9716.20s -> 9717.64s]  he?
[9717.64s -> 9719.32s]  Did what happened? I'm so confused
[9719.32s -> 9721.08s]  right now. What happened?
[9721.08s -> 9723.37s]  I don't even know where the guy
[9723.37s -> 9728.79s]  where that guy was. What the heck?
[9728.79s -> 9747.64s]  Did that guy shoot himself?
[9747.72s -> 9749.64s]  I fucking tried to throw.
[9752.84s -> 9763.14s]  I got stuck in them. Fucking doorway.
[9763.14s -> 9765.06s]  It's like my guy's body is made out
[9765.06s -> 9767.54s]  of magnets and when you touch a door
[9767.54s -> 9783.30s]  you just get sucked into it. Bring the
[9783.30s -> 9784.18s]  other fucking dog up here.
[9784.18s -> 9785.30s]  Just do it. I mean just do it. The
[9785.30s -> 9791.67s]  dog's coming. Just bring it.
[9791.67s -> 9815.86s]  Oh my god damn it. Why? Where the
[9815.86s -> 9816.66s]  fuck are you?
[9816.66s -> 9818.98s]  Okay don't let some random guy get
[9818.98s -> 9819.86s]  out of bed.
[9819.86s -> 9821.54s]  It's like fucking Minecraft bed and
[9821.54s -> 9839.27s]  come get me. I need a better view.
[9839.27s -> 9841.35s]  All right so there's nobody with a gun
[9841.35s -> 9842.23s]  over there.
[9842.23s -> 9843.67s]  So I can get down into that room but
[9843.67s -> 9844.47s]  I gotta be careful because of the
[9844.47s -> 9866.76s]  windows.
[9866.76s -> 9869.06s]  Anybody in that room? Okay there's one
[9869.06s -> 9870.10s]  more guy.
[9870.10s -> 9874.10s]  All right I think I can get. I got six
[9874.10s -> 9875.22s]  shots.
[9875.22s -> 9877.70s]  Nobody in there has a gun. This guy's
[9877.70s -> 9880.28s]  I did not expect that to happen that
[9880.28s -> 9881.24s]  quickly.
[9881.24s -> 9886.55s]  Got it okay. Ooh tough game we got
[9886.55s -> 9888.47s]  here. Tough game.
[9888.47s -> 9904.74s]  Is that it? No. Hold on let me. Tough game
[9904.74s -> 9910.78s]  we got here.
[9910.78s -> 9921.74s]  Whoa shit there's a window.
[9921.74s -> 9923.42s]  What the fuck are you doing? Get up you
[9923.42s -> 9924.62s]  fucking idiot.
[9924.62s -> 9930.23s]  Why?
[9930.23s -> 9933.08s]  Okay we're safe. Just shoot the
[9933.08s -> 9934.84s]  duck as I walk by.
[9934.84s -> 9958.23s]  Oh fuck. What am I doing? Why would you
[9958.23s -> 9959.75s]  even walk up there? There's no reason
[9959.75s -> 9961.75s]  for you to do what you just did.
[9961.75s -> 9976.38s]  My hand's in the air.
[9983.10s -> 9987.99s]  That was pretty good too. That's
[9987.99s -> 9997.43s]  pretty good.
[9997.51s -> 10017.03s]  Oh it's a dog.
[10017.03s -> 10022.68s]  And it's is one fucking pixel away
[10022.68s -> 10023.56s]  apparently.
[10023.56s -> 10050.44s]  Okay easy. I'm just I don't care.
[10050.44s -> 10061.48s]  Line them up. I'm just testing my it's just
[10061.48s -> 10064.18s]  a patience test.
[10064.18s -> 10065.94s]  This is a gear check for me to see if
[10065.94s -> 10084.34s]  I'm patient at all.
[10084.34s -> 10086.18s]  I'm eating my coke. I'm chewing on my
[10086.18s -> 10095.93s]  chewy coke.
[10095.93s -> 10116.58s]  I'm just trying to go too fast. Okay
[10116.58s -> 10123.14s]  get guns? No. Anybody with a gun in
[10123.14s -> 10125.98s]  there?
[10125.98s -> 10135.19s]  I don't know. I don't know. That's the
[10135.19s -> 10146.57s]  only good. That's what comes with rooms.
[10146.57s -> 10150.66s]  Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey oh
[10150.66s -> 10159.06s]  oh oh where do I go? Oh my god what am I
[10159.06s -> 10159.62s]  doing?
[10159.62s -> 10161.46s]  I don't know what I'm doing. I gotta
[10161.46s -> 10176.98s]  go this way.
[10176.98s -> 10186.55s]  What hey wait a minute.
[10192.78s -> 10196.57s]  Fuck. I'm so I had a gun.
[10196.57s -> 10198.65s]  I didn't even think I had a gun. How
[10198.65s -> 10200.97s]  was I supposed to? No.
[10200.97s -> 10207.77s]  I was supposed to. Oh my fucking
[10207.77s -> 10211.56s]  god. Who made this game? Why did you
[10211.56s -> 10212.44s]  make this game?
[10212.44s -> 10216.78s]  Why did you make this game? Why did
[10216.78s -> 10223.42s]  what did you make this game for?
[10223.42s -> 10232.23s]  Fucking door. I made this game for you.
[10232.23s -> 10236.62s]  Why are they there? No.
[10236.62s -> 10239.18s]  Oh I'm gonna unravel. I'm gonna
[10239.18s -> 10240.14s]  unravel.
[10240.14s -> 10241.50s]  Mm-hmm. No that's gonna happen. We're
[10241.50s -> 10242.78s]  already like three hours into this and
[10242.78s -> 10243.74s]  I'm like I'm already fucking
[10243.74s -> 10251.08s]  unraveling.
[10251.08s -> 10259.70s]  All right. Okay how many shots does
[10259.70s -> 10262.18s]  I shot three times?
[10262.18s -> 10286.18s]  I don't want that guy to even see me.
[10286.18s -> 10291.64s]  I've unraveled completely.
[10291.64s -> 10295.35s]  Wowie.
[10295.35s -> 10308.57s]  Where are we?
[10308.57s -> 10316.73s]  Fucking god. They just have so many
[10316.73s -> 10320.17s]  angles.
[10320.17s -> 10323.21s]  There's so many angles on me. It's
[10323.21s -> 10334.09s]  horrible.
[10334.09s -> 10336.81s]  Give me the fucking god. What? Why
[10336.81s -> 10337.61s]  does it
[10337.61s -> 10341.85s]  not? Why? I want to pick the gun up off
[10341.85s -> 10342.73s]  the fucking
[10342.73s -> 10352.41s]  ground. I'm gonna go I'm gonna literally
[10352.41s -> 10353.85s]  just gonna say I'm gonna take 15
[10353.85s -> 10355.05s]  straight minutes to beat this. I'm
[10355.05s -> 10357.05s]  gonna go as slow as humanly possible.
[10357.05s -> 10359.61s]  Ready? I'm literally gonna take 25
[10359.61s -> 10361.45s]  fucking minutes starting now. Count.
[10361.45s -> 10391.11s]  Where's the gun? I need another gun. I need
[10391.11s -> 10393.38s]  another gun.
[10393.38s -> 10397.38s]  Oh my god the fucking perfect angle.
[10397.38s -> 10413.54s]  Give me a fucking break. Oh my god
[10413.54s -> 10414.18s]  this is just
[10414.26s -> 10430.31s]  pain the video game. Oh and like all the
[10430.31s -> 10431.11s]  sudden that guy
[10431.11s -> 10432.79s]  that that guy let me look at that guy
[10432.79s -> 10435.91s]  just fucking sprinted down to shoot me.
[10435.91s -> 10438.07s]  Where was that guy? Why was he the
[10438.07s -> 10438.79s]  only one that
[10438.79s -> 10441.80s]  sprinted to my exact location? He's
[10441.80s -> 10442.92s]  the only one that saw me.
[10442.92s -> 10446.74s]  Only guy. I'm just gonna sprint to
[10446.74s -> 10448.89s]  his exact location to shoot him.
[10448.89s -> 10452.65s]  What? Why did this fucking guy not
[10452.65s -> 10453.45s]  see me? This guy.
[10453.45s -> 10455.53s]  That guy. This guy. No guy like a guy
[10455.53s -> 10456.81s]  all the fucking way up here was
[10456.81s -> 10458.09s]  like yeah that's right I'll go this
[10458.09s -> 10493.88s]  way.
[10493.88s -> 10504.31s]  Oh no noooo.
[10504.31s -> 10511.26s]  This level is a pleb filter.
[10511.26s -> 10512.86s]  Oh it's called I'm unraveling. I had
[10512.86s -> 10516.10s]  the fucking level beat already
[10516.10s -> 10518.02s]  and one of these dickheads accidentally
[10518.02s -> 10519.06s]  killed me up there then I got the
[10519.06s -> 10520.82s]  whole fucking thing over again.
[10520.82s -> 10530.23s]  And there's another this is another
[10530.23s -> 10532.87s]  dog. Well this is just fucking
[10532.87s -> 10533.67s]  wonderful. What the hell am I
[10533.67s -> 10544.57s]  supposed to do about this?
[10544.57s -> 10546.41s]  Jesus god give me the gun for the
[10546.41s -> 10551.67s]  love of all the desacred.
[10551.67s -> 10552.87s]  Up there. Guy can shoot all the way
[10552.87s -> 10554.98s]  from fucking there down here.
[10554.98s -> 10564.01s]  Fuck off. You know we call that we call
[10564.01s -> 10565.53s]  that bullshit.
[10565.53s -> 10573.85s]  Oh my god. Why do those fucking guys
[10573.85s -> 10574.97s]  have to exist in a game where
[10574.97s -> 10576.17s]  everybody dies in one hit?
[10576.17s -> 10578.17s]  The guy that takes like five. It's
[10578.17s -> 10581.51s]  just oh my god.
[10581.51s -> 10598.47s]  It's driving me crazy.
[10598.47s -> 10605.86s]  Fuck this level. This is the longest
[10605.86s -> 10607.14s]  I've spent on a level in the two
[10607.14s -> 10609.38s]  fucking both of these games.
[10609.38s -> 10619.05s]  I'm so angry that I didn't hit any
[10619.05s -> 10625.29s]  of those. I hate the doors. Remove
[10625.29s -> 10626.09s]  the doors.
[10626.09s -> 10627.29s]  Is there like a cheat I can put in
[10627.29s -> 10629.29s]  to remove all doors from the game?
[10629.29s -> 10638.89s]  They just they're just a hindrance. They
[10638.89s -> 10640.78s]  just get in the fucking way.
[10640.78s -> 10642.06s]  All doors. When are they gonna can I
[10642.06s -> 10647.00s]  patch that in? Oh fucking god I don't
[10647.00s -> 10647.64s]  have
[10647.64s -> 10673.69s]  him god. Somebody said this is the
[10673.69s -> 10674.89s]  this is one of the worst missions in
[10674.89s -> 10675.69s]  the game.
[10675.69s -> 10682.71s]  All right I don't I don't get it. So
[10682.71s -> 10684.47s]  you shoot the big guy. They literally
[10684.47s -> 10685.83s]  don't die for like five straight
[10685.83s -> 10686.79s]  seconds and then they die. You only
[10686.79s -> 10700.01s]  have to shoot them once.
[10700.01s -> 10702.09s]  I hate this level. This is ruining
[10702.09s -> 10719.77s]  the whole game for me.
[10719.77s -> 10725.19s]  This level. I think this is the level
[10725.19s -> 10726.31s]  that made me stop playing. Is that are
[10726.31s -> 10727.35s]  you really for real?
[10727.35s -> 10739.26s]  Is it not just me? I heard a dog.
[10739.26s -> 10740.62s]  Where the fuck is he?
[10740.62s -> 10756.78s]  I only have two bullets. Now what the
[10756.78s -> 10757.90s]  fuck am I gonna do?
[10757.90s -> 10767.35s]  None of those guys have guns. Don't get
[10767.35s -> 10768.79s]  seen by these guys. That happens
[10768.79s -> 10769.99s]  every time.
[10769.99s -> 10777.72s]  Oh my fucking god.
[10777.72s -> 10798.10s]  Why?
[10798.10s -> 10799.86s]  Uh where did that guy come from?
[10799.86s -> 10800.82s]  Did he shoot me from? Oh yeah oh
[10800.82s -> 10801.86s]  well sorry you shot me.
[10801.86s -> 10803.14s]  Is it the guy that shot me from across the whole
[10803.14s -> 10804.98s]  game through the window?
[10804.98s -> 10806.42s]  I was just curious.
[10806.42s -> 10831.88s]  Now what the fuck. I gotta make it across but oh
[10831.88s -> 10832.92s]  there he is.
[10832.92s -> 10854.28s]  Okay got him. What are these fucking
[10854.28s -> 10855.32s]  patrols?
[10855.32s -> 10857.80s]  How many more people you got in that room
[10857.80s -> 10858.76s]  with a gun?
[10858.76s -> 10878.20s]  Why is this guy still in Anor Londo?
[10878.20s -> 10883.82s]  I have to go around this way.
[10883.82s -> 10885.58s]  Anybody with a gun over here?
[10885.58s -> 10892.33s]  No there's not. Okay. I have two
[10892.33s -> 10893.37s]  bullets.
[10893.37s -> 10910.86s]  Fuck. I'm gonna get sniped from
[10910.86s -> 10912.30s]  across the map aren't I?
[10912.30s -> 10918.49s]  I thought the waves was a gun.
[10918.49s -> 10920.01s]  All right nobody else has a gun but
[10920.01s -> 10920.81s]  neither do I.
[10920.81s -> 10922.89s]  This is not good. This is really bad.
[10922.89s -> 10928.25s]  I need to get one of those guns.
[10928.25s -> 10935.86s]  Preferably the shotgun. Got it. Okay.
[10935.86s -> 10938.10s]  I'm going back. No. Stay over here.
[10938.10s -> 10946.95s]  Is that it? Don't. There's anybody coming around the
[10946.95s -> 10948.31s]  sides. There's anybody coming around the
[10948.31s -> 10949.99s]  sides. Just kill me.
[10949.99s -> 10956.60s]  Where's the other guy? Where is this
[10956.60s -> 10958.20s]  last person?
[10958.20s -> 10962.36s]  Oh my. Thank god. Oh my fucking god get
[10962.36s -> 10963.83s]  me out of here.
[10963.83s -> 10973.38s]  I hate this. This is the worst level ever. I hate this. No. This way.
[10973.38s -> 10981.19s]  There's more.
[10981.75s -> 10984.47s]  I'm gonna cry.
[10984.47s -> 11005.51s]  I almost just cried on stream.
[11005.51s -> 11010.86s]  Doing it right. Look. What are these
[11010.86s -> 11011.90s]  guys?
[11011.90s -> 11017.96s]  It's the windows that just do it to
[11017.96s -> 11026.28s]  me man. I just can't handle it.
[11026.28s -> 11032.81s]  Okay. There's too many things to pay attention to.
[11032.81s -> 11034.17s]  Like somebody can if someone when people
[11034.17s -> 11035.61s]  can just shoot you across the whole
[11035.61s -> 11036.82s]  map.
[11036.82s -> 11039.70s]  This makes you so paranoid. Like that
[11039.70s -> 11040.98s]  guy right there can shoot through the
[11040.98s -> 11062.97s]  whole game over here to kill me.
[11062.97s -> 11067.06s]  God. Oh you bastard game with the
[11067.06s -> 11073.54s]  fucking door.
[11073.54s -> 11075.78s]  Fucking door. Man rip it off the
[11075.78s -> 11076.82s]  hinges.
[11076.82s -> 11077.86s]  Is there a character that puts a
[11077.86s -> 11078.90s]  mask on that could rip the fucking
[11078.90s -> 11097.93s]  door off the hinges?
[11097.93s -> 11100.33s]  Gee. And where did you come from?
[11100.33s -> 11106.26s]  This is a guy with a shotgun up here
[11106.26s -> 11127.48s]  apparently somehow.
[11127.48s -> 11159.11s]  Fucking god. I can do it too asshole.
[11159.11s -> 11162.39s]  No god. Fucking windows
[11162.39s -> 11173.26s]  are everywhere. I'm so paranoid.
[11173.26s -> 11176.74s]  If I step foot out there I'm dead.
[11176.74s -> 11179.82s]  I'm gonna can I go down? I'm gonna try
[11179.82s -> 11188.30s]  going this way.
[11188.30s -> 11191.43s]  Window right there. You gotta be
[11191.43s -> 11192.95s]  fucking kidding me. I like
[11192.95s -> 11195.03s]  the windows man. That just just makes
[11195.03s -> 11196.71s]  it so easy
[11196.71s -> 11221.50s]  for you to get shot from anywhere.
[11221.50s -> 11223.02s]  You can win by just spraying but
[11223.02s -> 11224.38s]  yeah but I
[11224.38s -> 11225.82s]  I'm gonna alert the whole room and then
[11225.82s -> 11227.82s]  I'm gonna get collapsed on.
[11227.82s -> 11236.04s]  Where the fuck did that guy come from?
[11236.04s -> 11241.29s]  What was he doing over here?
[11241.29s -> 11242.97s]  Who is the AI director spawning in
[11242.97s -> 11249.94s]  these enemies?
[11249.94s -> 11292.15s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[11292.15s -> 11293.91s]  Goddamn game man.
[11293.91s -> 11295.99s]  This goddamn fucking game.
[11295.99s -> 11299.03s]  Did the same guys make the first one
[11299.03s -> 11300.15s]  and the second one?
[11300.15s -> 11302.47s]  This is the same team that made the
[11302.47s -> 11318.60s]  second one?
[11318.60s -> 11326.01s]  God damn it.
[11326.01s -> 11336.42s]  He's supposed to die. Fucking Jesus.
[11336.42s -> 11339.22s]  Only shoot him once and he'll die.
[11339.22s -> 11340.82s]  He did.
[11340.82s -> 11342.84s]  I feel like way more than the first
[11342.84s -> 11345.00s]  game. Like moving a quarter of an inch
[11345.00s -> 11348.71s]  kills you in this one.
[11348.71s -> 11350.07s]  Am I right on that?
[11350.07s -> 11351.59s]  Is it like moving three inches kills
[11351.59s -> 11374.39s]  you in this game?
[11374.39s -> 11394.39s]  He's like I feel like I just have to
[11394.39s -> 11396.23s]  stand in the same corner
[11396.23s -> 11401.00s]  the whole time. Because if I move
[11401.00s -> 11402.44s]  it's just there's a hundred people
[11402.44s -> 11404.52s]  that just have 20 different angles
[11404.52s -> 11406.12s]  with like sniper rifles.
[11406.12s -> 11436.71s]  I'm out of bullets. All right so
[11436.71s -> 11454.84s]  give me this.
[11454.84s -> 11457.74s]  One guy with a gun. There's more
[11457.74s -> 11458.86s]  than one guy with a gun.
[11458.86s -> 11469.80s]  Empty. Anybody have a gun over here?
[11469.80s -> 11471.00s]  Somebody has to have a gun.
[11471.00s -> 11484.15s]  What the fuck was that aim? What the hell
[11484.15s -> 11485.35s]  are you shooting at?
[11485.35s -> 11494.42s]  Try another one. Try to try a shotgun
[11494.42s -> 11495.54s]  this time.
[11495.54s -> 11504.71s]  Shoot through the game. I think that's
[11504.71s -> 11514.17s]  it. Get me out of here please.
[11514.17s -> 11533.42s]  That was the worst one by far. Where the
[11533.42s -> 11534.46s]  fuck am I going?
[11534.46s -> 11542.89s]  I forgot how long ago that was
[11542.89s -> 11544.49s]  because I hated that part too.
[11544.49s -> 11556.57s]  You haven't seen the worst. There are
[11556.57s -> 11559.90s]  still more horrors.
[11559.90s -> 11562.84s]  Really? You know you shoot it out.
[11562.84s -> 11570.18s]  Really? There's a level later on that
[11570.18s -> 11572.26s]  turns your keyboard into acid.
[11580.20s -> 11581.48s]  You know you should really wait for
[11581.48s -> 11582.76s]  backup in these situations.
[11582.76s -> 11584.46s]  It's not my fault you guys took so
[11584.46s -> 11585.66s]  long to get here, is it?
[11585.66s -> 11588.84s]  I got here first. You got a problem with
[11588.84s -> 11591.32s]  that? What are you doing? You're reckless.
[11591.32s -> 11592.60s]  Your actions endanger this whole
[11592.60s -> 11595.05s]  operation. Give me a break.
[11595.05s -> 11596.66s]  Operation? What are you talking about?
[11596.66s -> 11597.94s]  You don't like it? Go complain to the
[11597.94s -> 11599.14s]  chief. I'm out of here.
[11599.14s -> 11602.66s]  I'm out of here. Is it right? Just
[11602.66s -> 11605.03s]  get me to the next level.
[11605.03s -> 11608.58s]  I can look at the game with a fresh
[11608.58s -> 11610.42s]  new start after that one.
[11610.42s -> 11622.17s]  A nice chill stream. Somehow I got a
[11622.17s -> 11623.61s]  C plus on that. It would take 40
[11623.61s -> 11624.97s]  minutes to do that. How did I get a
[11624.97s -> 11626.57s]  C plus on that one but like a fucking
[11626.57s -> 11628.01s]  D on the other one? And I did the
[11628.01s -> 11629.53s]  other one way cleaner.
[11629.53s -> 11632.09s]  This one took 40 minutes. How did I get
[11632.09s -> 11634.95s]  a D on the other one and a C on that?
[11634.95s -> 11640.42s]  I don't understand. Let me guess our
[11640.42s -> 11643.62s]  serial killer has been at it again.
[11643.62s -> 11649.45s]  What gave it away? He left another
[11649.45s -> 11650.89s]  message for us, mundane as ever.
[11650.89s -> 11652.73s]  Please don't make me do it again.
[11652.73s -> 11654.65s]  Well at least he got a bit creative
[11654.65s -> 11656.65s]  with the victim. Poor kid.
[11656.65s -> 11658.18s]  Maybe he was upset that the papers
[11658.18s -> 11660.50s]  haven't made a bigger deal of them.
[11660.50s -> 11662.02s]  These scumbags seem to crave
[11662.02s -> 11664.58s]  attention. I gotta relax. I'm so angry
[11664.58s -> 11666.25s]  at that last level.
[11666.25s -> 11675.02s]  I can still feel it. Red check.
[11675.02s -> 11680.04s]  Am I like fucking red? I got like a red
[11680.04s -> 11681.54s]  nose.
[11681.54s -> 11688.52s]  I'm like red down here. Not really.
[11688.52s -> 11692.01s]  All right, well that's fine. I'm
[11692.01s -> 11705.80s]  looking at the wrong camera.
[11705.80s -> 11709.58s]  You expected it at out of sync. Don't
[11709.58s -> 11711.26s]  we all, huh? You might be getting your
[11711.26s -> 11712.78s]  fair share once this gets out.
[11712.78s -> 11714.06s]  Think you can handle the pressure? All
[11714.06s -> 11715.58s]  eyes will be on you now.
[11715.58s -> 11717.16s]  I'm sure this guy will slip up
[11717.16s -> 11718.84s]  sooner or later. Speaking of which,
[11718.84s -> 11719.96s]  what have you got from me? Any
[11719.96s -> 11721.16s]  findings?
[11721.16s -> 11722.76s]  Not much. No murder, weapon, and no win. I
[11722.76s -> 11726.30s]  gotta relax.
[11726.30s -> 11744.98s]  Change of plans. I need like a
[11744.98s -> 11746.66s]  meditation video.
[11746.66s -> 11755.78s]  I need to do a meditation. Guided
[11755.78s -> 11756.66s]  meditation.
[11756.66s -> 11768.26s]  Hold on. I'm gonna mute this for a
[11768.26s -> 11769.46s]  second. I have to do this, guys. I'm
[11769.46s -> 11770.18s]  sorry.
[11770.18s -> 11789.90s]  I'm like, I'm all fired up. It's
[11789.90s -> 11794.18s]  supposed to be instructions.
[11794.18s -> 11796.50s]  Thank you for being here, dear soul.
[11796.50s -> 11798.74s]  I'm Kenneth, and from my heart, I
[11798.74s -> 11800.98s]  will... Is this the cheers for you guy?
[11800.98s -> 11802.74s]  This is the cheers to you guy? I think
[11802.74s -> 11804.18s]  this is the cheers to you.
[11804.18s -> 11807.03s]  As comfortable as you can right this
[11807.03s -> 11809.27s]  moment.
[11809.27s -> 11815.29s]  Allow yourself just be here and now
[11815.29s -> 11818.86s]  observing the words I share with you
[11818.86s -> 11824.10s]  like a soft breeze on a summer night.
[11824.10s -> 11825.94s]  Noticing whatever it is that you
[11825.94s -> 11827.38s]  notice.
[11827.38s -> 11829.78s]  Your body may begin to relax more
[11829.78s -> 11831.14s]  and more. This is not fucking helping.
[11831.14s -> 11833.30s]  As you listen to my voice,
[11833.30s -> 11836.52s]  go deeper within. How would somebody be
[11836.52s -> 11837.88s]  able to sleep to this?
[11837.88s -> 11839.88s]  Could you imagine? All right, seriously,
[11839.88s -> 11841.08s]  wait a second.
[11841.08s -> 11843.80s]  Wait. Can you imagine if you were
[11843.80s -> 11845.40s]  trying to go to sleep?
[11845.40s -> 11847.96s]  Okay. You lay down and you're like, man,
[11847.96s -> 11849.24s]  I really wish I had something to help
[11849.24s -> 11850.44s]  me go to sleep. And I'm like, I only
[11850.44s -> 11851.48s]  help you there.
[11851.48s -> 11853.56s]  And I go right up to your fucking ear.
[11853.56s -> 11856.63s]  And I'm like, very soon you'll be
[11856.63s -> 11858.30s]  sleeping.
[11858.30s -> 11860.38s]  And just to let you know, it's so
[11860.38s -> 11862.30s]  relaxing in this room.
[11862.30s -> 11865.24s]  And very soon you'll be going to bed
[11865.24s -> 11866.84s]  just like the breeze of a sunny
[11866.84s -> 11868.60s]  summer Monday morning.
[11868.60s -> 11870.68s]  That's the way that you'll see the
[11870.68s -> 11872.60s]  world. Like, you're gonna be like, what
[11872.60s -> 11873.48s]  the fuck? What are you doing to me?
[11873.48s -> 11875.16s]  Like, I'm trying to sleep. I need
[11875.16s -> 11877.08s]  complete silence. And I need nobody
[11877.08s -> 11877.72s]  talking.
[11877.72s -> 11881.67s]  And I don't want any lights on. All
[11881.67s -> 11883.11s]  right, let's see if we can... Now I'm
[11883.11s -> 11883.67s]  even more
[11883.67s -> 11885.59s]  fucking on edge than I was before. It
[11885.59s -> 11890.66s]  didn't help. At all.
[11890.66s -> 11900.50s]  I just like burped. Where is my
[11900.50s -> 11905.40s]  meditation?
[11905.40s -> 11907.40s]  I just had it. Where is it? It's on a
[11907.40s -> 11909.32s]  different window. What the fuck is this
[11909.32s -> 11909.88s]  window?
[11909.88s -> 11913.86s]  Why is it down here? Help me! Come on!
[11913.86s -> 11918.34s]  Find its best way to let go naturally.
[11918.34s -> 11921.61s]  You don't need to relax. It may be that
[11921.61s -> 11924.65s]  your body needs to heal in other ways.
[11924.65s -> 11927.10s]  It's good to know that you're
[11927.10s -> 11928.70s]  unconscious.
[11928.70s -> 11932.57s]  Mine is an expert in healing and
[11932.57s -> 11934.17s]  balancing
[11934.17s -> 11939.30s]  in a safe and natural way while you
[11939.30s -> 11939.94s]  can just
[11939.94s -> 11948.54s]  flow with the experience. Change
[11948.54s -> 11951.99s]  is a natural aspect of life. Like a
[11951.99s -> 11952.63s]  tree
[11952.71s -> 11956.47s]  Turn this shit off!
[11956.47s -> 11962.23s]  Stubborn! Let me fucking relax!
[11962.23s -> 11967.62s]  That guy just made me so fucking angry!
[11967.62s -> 11970.89s]  Imagine now that you're breathing in
[11970.89s -> 11972.97s]  that life energy.
[11972.97s -> 11990.92s]  Electrician found him like this. He
[11990.92s -> 11992.60s]  must have been taken here.
[11992.60s -> 11994.12s]  Found cut marks around his wrists and
[11994.12s -> 11996.20s]  ankles. Death by strangulation.
[11996.20s -> 11998.98s]  The killer gutted him post-mortem.
[11998.98s -> 12000.44s]  Thank God.
[12000.44s -> 12002.68s]  Thank God. Anything else? Yeah seems
[12002.68s -> 12003.96s]  like the killer may have robbed him
[12003.96s -> 12006.46s]  on like previous victories.
[12006.46s -> 12010.90s]  Uh not victories. Couldn't find the
[12010.90s -> 12012.34s]  kid's wallet.
[12012.34s -> 12016.22s]  Who knows? Might have been someone else.
[12016.22s -> 12021.69s]  People have no morals these days.
[12021.69s -> 12023.61s]  Will have to run his prints. Fucking
[12023.61s -> 12025.13s]  god damn it. I'm on.
[12025.13s -> 12031.21s]  I'm off completely right now. I'm
[12031.21s -> 12032.25s]  gonna head back to the office. It's
[12032.25s -> 12033.45s]  been a rough night and I'm about to
[12033.45s -> 12035.93s]  get it. It's gonna get even harder.
[12035.93s -> 12037.21s]  This is ruining the game for me. I'm
[12037.21s -> 12038.09s]  too angry.
[12038.09s -> 12039.61s]  Just too hard. Oh it's gonna get so
[12039.61s -> 12040.81s]  much worse.
[12040.81s -> 12043.62s]  I'll let you know if you find anything
[12043.62s -> 12050.65s]  else. All right. Why does that guy have
[12050.65s -> 12051.93s]  that move? Why does that guy die?
[12051.93s -> 12053.13s]  Why does that guy die in one hit? He
[12053.13s -> 12059.22s]  should die in one hit.
[12059.22s -> 12061.38s]  The same people who make this game.
[12061.38s -> 12075.48s]  This is a great song.
[12075.48s -> 12079.18s]  Chicken delivery. Hey guys just got
[12079.18s -> 12082.07s]  the masks we ordered.
[12082.07s -> 12087.62s]  Pretty cool eh? They're all chickens.
[12087.62s -> 12088.74s]  Well how do they feel? You like
[12088.74s -> 12091.64s]  them?
[12091.64s -> 12095.54s]  Guys?
[12108.26s -> 12110.95s]  I think I just heard something. What are
[12110.95s -> 12114.02s]  you guys talking about?
[12124.86s -> 12130.18s]  I'll get it. Hey none of these phones
[12130.18s -> 12131.30s]  are ringing.
[12131.30s -> 12137.42s]  Sorry it's me. When did you get a
[12137.42s -> 12139.42s]  cell phone? I took it from that guy we
[12139.42s -> 12141.61s]  clocked at the bar.
[12141.61s -> 12142.89s]  Just charged it up this morning at
[12142.89s -> 12144.57s]  Dean's place. What should I do? Do I
[12144.57s -> 12145.37s]  answer?
[12145.37s -> 12147.77s]  I don't see any reason not to. All
[12147.77s -> 12149.86s]  right here goes nothing.
[12149.86s -> 12151.94s]  Hi it's me. I know you want it out
[12151.94s -> 12153.38s]  and I respect that but I just
[12153.38s -> 12154.66s]  figured I'd give you a call and see
[12154.66s -> 12155.78s]  if you've changed your mind.
[12155.78s -> 12156.98s]  You wouldn't believe what's been going
[12156.98s -> 12163.62s]  on the last few weeks. That was just
[12163.62s -> 12165.22s]  one of those outdoor frog sounds you
[12165.22s -> 12167.14s]  hear at night and in the fall.
[12167.14s -> 12168.50s]  We're calling the shots now. Top of
[12168.50s -> 12170.34s]  the game. No one can touch us.
[12170.34s -> 12171.62s]  The new product is in full scale
[12171.62s -> 12173.90s]  production. Get a new place.
[12173.90s -> 12176.06s]  Three floors up on northwest 20th
[12176.06s -> 12178.54s]  street. Who would have thought?
[12178.54s -> 12180.90s]  Why don't you swing on by and
[12180.90s -> 12183.30s]  check it out huh? Hello? Anyone there?
[12183.30s -> 12185.88s]  Click. Hey guys I think I just found
[12185.88s -> 12187.00s]  us something to do tonight.
[12187.00s -> 12188.28s]  Let's go right now. I'll tell you
[12188.28s -> 12189.56s]  all about it in the van.
[12189.56s -> 12194.90s]  What's somebody saying? Somebody's
[12194.90s -> 12196.02s]  saying the hardest level in the game?
[12196.02s -> 12198.02s]  Coming up. Best song in the game coming
[12198.02s -> 12208.98s]  up. Death wish. Can you open the door
[12208.98s -> 12210.26s]  already? It's getting pretty late.
[12210.26s -> 12212.42s]  They might be heading out soon. It was
[12212.42s -> 12214.02s]  your idea to stake the place out for
[12214.02s -> 12216.02s]  two hours. I'm working as fast as I
[12216.02s -> 12217.46s]  can.
[12217.46s -> 12218.90s]  Well we couldn't just barge in. You
[12218.90s -> 12220.34s]  gotta have a plan you know. At least
[12220.34s -> 12223.05s]  now we know where they are.
[12223.05s -> 12225.61s]  Dot dot dot. Just fucking open this
[12225.61s -> 12226.65s]  thing will ya?
[12226.65s -> 12228.17s]  Maybe you would like to take it over
[12228.17s -> 12230.41s]  then. I'm sure you'd get it open in
[12230.41s -> 12231.77s]  no use.
[12231.77s -> 12234.52s]  Yeah I didn't think so. I think I got
[12234.52s -> 12235.64s]  it now.
[12236.41s -> 12238.41s]  All right see you guys on the roof.
[12238.41s -> 12239.45s]  Don't forget to stay in touch with
[12239.45s -> 12241.05s]  the walkie talkies.
[12241.05s -> 12242.81s]  About the roof. You sure will be able
[12242.81s -> 12245.61s]  to jump across to the other building.
[12245.61s -> 12248.41s]  It looked a bit far to me. It's not
[12248.41s -> 12249.85s]  that far. Well at least not for the
[12249.85s -> 12251.96s]  rest of us.
[12251.96s -> 12253.88s]  Damn listen to this. You may have
[12253.88s -> 12255.24s]  some difficulties with it though
[12255.24s -> 12256.28s]  big guy.
[12256.28s -> 12261.53s]  Yeah fuck you too. Restart it. I
[12261.53s -> 12262.49s]  didn't mean to do that.
[12262.49s -> 12272.95s]  See you on the roof. Let's go. Bingo.
[12272.95s -> 12274.23s]  I'm ready. I don't know if this detail is
[12274.23s -> 12275.59s]  gonna be hard. I'm fucking putting my
[12275.59s -> 12276.95s]  game hands on.
[12276.95s -> 12282.82s]  Hold on. There's one glove. You can't
[12282.82s -> 12284.02s]  tell because the slap
[12284.02s -> 12297.24s]  of the surgical glove. Okay that guy
[12297.24s -> 12339.58s]  wasn't not that guy was alive.
[12339.58s -> 12347.02s]  What the hell is this?
[12347.02s -> 12352.73s]  I didn't do the cool thing. I just T
[12352.73s -> 12353.93s]  posed.
[12353.93s -> 12357.70s]  Jesus.
[12357.70s -> 12381.80s]  Who's left? Anybody else?
[12381.80s -> 12390.26s]  Okay two guys on that side. Nobody
[12390.26s -> 12391.46s]  left in this room so I'm safe to
[12391.46s -> 12392.66s]  stand here. So I've got a guy with a
[12392.66s -> 12395.14s]  melee. I'm gonna go top right.
[12395.14s -> 12398.09s]  If you aim down through here through
[12398.09s -> 12399.29s]  the window.
[12399.29s -> 12403.59s]  I don't think I can get him from here.
[12403.59s -> 12407.67s]  Shit. Oh god. The fucking windows.
[12407.67s -> 12432.46s]  Oh I'm so sick of the windows man.
[12432.46s -> 12441.32s]  Damn. I'm gonna try going down. Forget
[12441.32s -> 12442.20s]  about these guys right now. I'm gonna
[12442.20s -> 12443.56s]  get these guys through the window.
[12443.56s -> 12454.04s]  All right give me another gun. I'm safe
[12454.04s -> 12455.16s]  to go in here and shoot these guys
[12455.16s -> 12455.88s]  now.
[12455.88s -> 12457.08s]  But I'm gonna do it through the
[12457.08s -> 12472.81s]  window.
[12472.81s -> 12475.61s]  Oh come on Jeremy. Really? He's coming
[12475.61s -> 12476.49s]  down here.
[12476.49s -> 12480.04s]  Where is he? He's coming down here.
[12480.12s -> 12499.96s]  Die. I'm done here. Ending upstairs.
[12499.96s -> 12508.94s]  Next part. Let's go. One two.
[12508.94s -> 12519.54s]  Didn't know you were up there. Look at
[12519.54s -> 12533.18s]  that gun. Two melee.
[12533.18s -> 12536.70s]  Holy fuck. Okay. Geez.
[12536.70s -> 12550.30s]  Um. I think it's gone. Window. Of
[12550.30s -> 12552.71s]  course.
[12552.71s -> 12562.15s]  Window. Of course. You got to be
[12562.15s -> 12566.18s]  kidding me sir.
[12566.18s -> 12570.82s]  My god. That instant. Bug like
[12570.90s -> 12575.85s]  reaction time. Where is this other dude?
[12575.85s -> 12583.03s]  Is he all the way up there?
[12583.03s -> 12585.53s]  No windows here. It's safe to go up
[12585.53s -> 12586.81s]  here.
[12586.81s -> 12589.05s]  I can see that they're all dead. No
[12589.05s -> 12591.34s]  windows.
[12591.34s -> 12595.05s]  Up and in. Nobody else alive. All right.
[12595.05s -> 12596.41s]  Give me new gun.
[12596.41s -> 12599.82s]  There's windows. What do I do? I'm
[12599.82s -> 12604.04s]  freezing. I'm panicking. I'm frozen.
[12604.04s -> 12608.76s]  I'm frozen. What do I do? All right. I'm
[12608.76s -> 12610.12s]  gonna go back down.
[12610.12s -> 12615.66s]  This is it. Just this room and there's
[12615.66s -> 12617.40s]  a dog up here.
[12617.40s -> 12623.35s]  Get rid of that dog first. All right.
[12623.35s -> 12630.26s]  Only one way in this room.
[12630.26s -> 12632.90s]  You stupid game.
[12632.90s -> 12636.41s]  God damn it. Come on.
[12636.41s -> 12640.65s]  God man. Why did that happen?
[12640.65s -> 12644.39s]  Fucking hell. Shit. That was the end
[12644.39s -> 12644.95s]  too.
[12644.95s -> 12648.55s]  Come on. This is so hard. Those guys
[12648.55s -> 12650.31s]  can't be stopped.
[12650.31s -> 12655.64s]  Oh. I'm actually angry right now.
[12655.64s -> 12657.32s]  I was backpedaling but I got stuck
[12657.32s -> 12662.22s]  on a couch.
[12662.22s -> 12664.22s]  Those guys have to die. Those
[12664.22s -> 12665.50s]  people. You have to focus on those
[12665.50s -> 12666.70s]  people.
[12666.70s -> 12674.26s]  Because if those people...
[12674.26s -> 12677.70s]  Fuck me. I was so close too.
[12677.70s -> 12680.18s]  They just never stop running at you.
[12680.18s -> 12681.48s]  You have to shoot them with a
[12681.48s -> 12683.16s]  shotgun. I'm not gonna go in the
[12683.16s -> 12684.68s]  other room unless I have a shotgun.
[12684.68s -> 12693.83s]  I promise you guys. Just the
[12693.83s -> 12694.55s]  slightest
[12694.55s -> 12698.39s]  little minuscule tiny teeny mistake
[12698.39s -> 12701.19s]  and the whole thing is over.
[12701.19s -> 12708.63s]  Oh. It's so stressful.
[12708.63s -> 12710.23s]  Absolutely no mistakes are allowed to be
[12710.23s -> 12711.67s]  made. Damn it.
[12711.67s -> 12725.34s]  I went in here first last time. All
[12725.34s -> 12730.41s]  right. Shotgun this dude.
[12730.41s -> 12731.85s]  Has to be a shotgun. I can't let
[12731.85s -> 12733.21s]  those guys just fucking chase me around
[12733.21s -> 12742.39s]  a room and not die.
[12742.39s -> 12744.71s]  There's a guy right fucking there.
[12744.71s -> 12747.98s]  Jesus.
[12747.98s -> 12757.14s]  That's not a knife. What? Is this not
[12757.14s -> 12758.18s]  a knife?
[12758.18s -> 12760.62s]  Have I lost my mind? That's not a
[12760.62s -> 12762.22s]  knife. What?
[12762.22s -> 12777.96s]  Let's try this again. I can't see that far.
[12784.98s -> 12790.87s]  God damn it.
[12790.87s -> 12794.55s]  Oh man. But is there somebody still up
[12794.55s -> 12795.99s]  there?
[12795.99s -> 12800.04s]  I can't see. Okay. No.
[12800.04s -> 12801.48s]  Okay. For the future if I die again
[12801.48s -> 12802.84s]  there's only one guy that's up
[12802.84s -> 12803.72s]  there.
[12803.72s -> 12821.67s]  All right. Make sure I have a shotgun. I
[12821.67s -> 12826.30s]  believe that's it.
[12826.30s -> 12832.54s]  It's just that room now. All right. No.
[12832.54s -> 12833.58s]  No. No. There's a guy over there. It's
[12833.58s -> 12834.86s]  all right. Give me a shotgun. Is there a
[12834.86s -> 12836.14s]  shotgun?
[12836.14s -> 12838.78s]  Looking for a shotgun. There's it. Okay.
[12838.78s -> 12840.06s]  Here's one right here.
[12840.06s -> 12844.76s]  Plant it right in his head. Got it.
[12844.76s -> 12845.72s]  Okay.
[12845.72s -> 12855.86s]  Now. Oh fuck. A guy's coming. Which way
[12855.86s -> 12856.66s]  is he going?
[12856.66s -> 12859.14s]  Holy shit. It's a dog. What? That guy
[12859.14s -> 12860.82s]  turned into a dog.
[12860.82s -> 12867.72s]  That guy turned into a dog.
[12867.72s -> 12878.10s]  Why? Where was the dog?
[12878.10s -> 12883.34s]  Give me a break. How?
[12883.34s -> 12885.42s]  Oh. Guy runs out of the room and all
[12885.42s -> 12887.58s]  of a sudden dog is running after me.
[12887.58s -> 12892.73s]  I can't even believe it. The guy was a
[12892.73s -> 12894.33s]  fucking werewolf.
[12894.33s -> 12913.06s]  Give me a fucking break, man. I can't even
[12913.06s -> 12914.34s]  fucking believe it.
[12914.34s -> 12929.18s]  That is un-fucking-believable. Got the
[12929.18s -> 12934.63s]  guy up there.
[12934.63s -> 12937.27s]  Where the fuck? Who are you guys?
[12937.27s -> 12949.22s]  I don't even... I didn't even know I had
[12949.22s -> 12950.90s]  the fucking role. I keep forgetting
[12950.90s -> 12956.73s]  that it's in this game.
[12956.73s -> 12957.85s]  And great. You got... you came out
[12957.85s -> 12959.45s]  this time. Nice. The one time you
[12959.45s -> 12961.21s]  ever opened that door.
[12961.21s -> 12969.72s]  The whole game is running after me
[12969.72s -> 12976.12s]  now. Anybody else like... running
[12976.12s -> 12978.04s]  after me?
[12978.04s -> 12984.82s]  Who the fuck was that guy? Who the
[12984.82s -> 12986.66s]  fuck was this guy?
[12986.66s -> 12990.14s]  What the hell was that? One of the guys
[12990.14s -> 12991.82s]  on the ground was not dead.
[12991.82s -> 12994.30s]  What the fuck just happened?
[12994.30s -> 13013.70s]  I'm losing it here. It's really only...
[13013.70s -> 13014.82s]  There's one way I can do this. This is
[13014.82s -> 13016.26s]  the way I was doing it before.
[13016.26s -> 13049.18s]  And I'm so fucked. How are you
[13049.18s -> 13050.70s]  like reliably supposed to go in this
[13050.70s -> 13052.33s]  room?
[13052.33s -> 13053.77s]  Like isn't part of this game about
[13053.77s -> 13055.29s]  going really fast?
[13055.29s -> 13056.33s]  How would you ever do it in this
[13056.33s -> 13057.61s]  room?
[13057.61s -> 13059.21s]  It's just... you have to wait till
[13059.21s -> 13060.17s]  they get in a certain spot where you
[13060.17s -> 13061.93s]  can get them both, right?
[13061.93s -> 13065.85s]  Like dodge roll around them?
[13065.85s -> 13067.13s]  What are the iframes like in the
[13067.13s -> 13068.25s]  dog?
[13068.25s -> 13075.24s]  Okay, that's kind of a huge deal. I
[13075.24s -> 13076.92s]  didn't even know there were iframes.
[13076.92s -> 13087.53s]  Well, that changes a lot.
[13087.53s -> 13106.62s]  Ah, come on.
[13106.62s -> 13108.65s]  I gotta just focus on beating it.
[13108.65s -> 13109.85s]  I'm not gonna do dodge rolling
[13109.85s -> 13110.97s]  shit. Not now. It's way too late for
[13110.97s -> 13111.85s]  me to learn how to do that right
[13111.85s -> 13112.81s]  now.
[13112.81s -> 13133.50s]  All right, I need another gun. Try it
[13133.50s -> 13134.62s]  again.
[13134.62s -> 13143.34s]  Dodge rolling sucks in this game. I
[13143.34s -> 13143.90s]  mean...
[13143.90s -> 13145.66s]  I don't know. I feel like it's going
[13145.66s -> 13147.26s]  to cause more problems if I try to use
[13147.26s -> 13153.64s]  it.
[13153.64s -> 13163.13s]  Did I kill the guy up here? Okay, I did.
[13163.13s -> 13167.35s]  One, two... this one guy right here.
[13167.35s -> 13172.89s]  Holy shit. Okay. A guy patrols in that
[13172.89s -> 13173.69s]  room.
[13173.69s -> 13177.88s]  So... that guy will kill me. Okay,
[13177.88s -> 13178.36s]  isn't that right?
[13178.36s -> 13186.55s]  Shoot him. Did I get him? I don't think
[13186.55s -> 13187.35s]  I did.
[13187.35s -> 13194.95s]  He's right there. Oh my fucking god.
[13194.95s -> 13197.11s]  A goddamn computer.
[13197.11s -> 13200.31s]  I shot the computer. I shot the
[13200.31s -> 13200.87s]  compu-
[13200.87s -> 13224.82s]  Calm down. I need a gun. Oh my fucking
[13224.82s -> 13226.98s]  god. Give me a break.
[13226.98s -> 13261.99s]  Kidding me. How did I not get the other
[13261.99s -> 13262.55s]  guy?
[13262.55s -> 13271.35s]  The worst part is not being able to
[13271.35s -> 13272.71s]  see down here. You know what I mean?
[13272.71s -> 13273.35s]  It's just like
[13273.35s -> 13277.24s]  taking a guess. When do I unlock the
[13277.24s -> 13278.52s]  guy with the mask that you can see
[13278.52s -> 13279.32s]  further?
[13279.32s -> 13297.02s]  A door. You don't get it in this
[13297.02s -> 13297.74s]  game.
[13297.74s -> 13308.14s]  Okay, there's a dog. I need a weapon.
[13308.14s -> 13316.34s]  Where's that dog?
[13316.34s -> 13320.26s]  I'm gonna get- I gotta find that
[13320.26s -> 13326.42s]  dog now. All right, he's in that room.
[13326.42s -> 13328.42s]  He's over here. He's sniffing me out.
[13328.42s -> 13330.50s]  This dog is sniffing me out right now.
[13330.84s -> 13334.50s]  He ha- I gotta get rid of him now. All
[13334.50s -> 13335.86s]  right, that was the one of the- I'm just
[13335.86s -> 13337.14s]  like bumping the microphone. I'm so
[13337.14s -> 13340.70s]  fucking on edge.
[13340.70s -> 13341.66s]  Don't know where the hell you came
[13341.66s -> 13344.82s]  from, but that's fine. All right, back
[13344.82s -> 13345.70s]  around.
[13345.70s -> 13364.07s]  Where's this guy? Where the fuck is he?
[13364.07s -> 13365.19s]  No, he's gonna come around this way,
[13365.19s -> 13366.70s]  isn't he?
[13366.70s -> 13369.74s]  I don't know. I can't see. I can't
[13369.74s -> 13373.86s]  see where he is.
[13373.86s -> 13391.67s]  I'm like trapped right here. Dog.
[13391.67s -> 13398.30s]  I didn't even know you could- I
[13398.30s -> 13399.90s]  forgot you could go through that way.
[13399.90s -> 13406.63s]  All right, I'm almost done. Way to go.
[13406.63s -> 13413.91s]  Last guy. He's over there, and there's
[13413.91s -> 13415.91s]  nobody else, right?
[13415.91s -> 13417.27s]  I think that's it, and I'm pretty sure
[13417.27s -> 13419.46s]  I'm out of here after this.
[13419.46s -> 13430.26s]  No. Where's this fucking hidden person?
[13430.26s -> 13434.92s]  Oh, they're down there. Oh no!
[13434.92s -> 13437.50s]  No, I'm so scared.
[13437.50s -> 13438.78s]  Give me a gun. I need to come with a
[13438.78s -> 13440.30s]  lot of bullets.
[13440.30s -> 13446.60s]  This'll do. Just two, but I have to
[13446.60s -> 13448.60s]  go all the way around and down.
[13448.60s -> 13449.80s]  But what if they see me? They're
[13449.80s -> 13451.56s]  gonna shoot me
[13451.56s -> 13452.92s]  from a hundred miles away, because I
[13452.92s -> 13454.84s]  can't see where they are.
[13454.84s -> 13477.61s]  You understand? Like, how the fuck- fucking
[13477.61s -> 13478.33s]  god,
[13478.33s -> 13481.54s]  get me out of here! I think I'm done
[13481.54s -> 13482.98s]  here. How are you guys doing?
[13482.98s -> 13486.10s]  There's more. There's another one.
[13486.10s -> 13487.70s]  There's a whole other floor. All right,
[13487.70s -> 13489.38s]  this is punch time.
[13489.38s -> 13493.16s]  Oh, okay, you can- all right. It's two
[13493.16s -> 13494.44s]  punches.
[13494.44s -> 13516.57s]  Well, you have a gun. Come on in. I'll
[13516.57s -> 13517.69s]  take you all.
[13517.69s -> 13520.17s]  Guy with a gun right there. All
[13520.17s -> 13521.61s]  right, he's at the window. Let me get
[13521.61s -> 13532.44s]  this guy first.
[13532.44s -> 13534.92s]  Okay, no guns, right? Only guy with
[13534.92s -> 13536.36s]  a gun is over there.
[13536.44s -> 13537.64s]  Window's here though. Where's the guy with
[13537.64s -> 13543.06s]  a gun? Up there. Oh, come on.
[13543.06s -> 13544.82s]  Out of line of sight, guys with guns
[13544.82s -> 13546.26s]  across the map.
[13546.26s -> 13569.30s]  It's starting to become tiring. How am
[13569.30s -> 13572.01s]  I gonna kill this guy?
[13572.01s -> 13576.34s]  Uh, how am I gonna kill this guy?
[13576.34s -> 13577.70s]  What the fuck are you supposed to do
[13577.70s -> 13579.46s]  about that guy? Punch up through the
[13579.46s -> 13595.85s]  window?
[13595.85s -> 13618.09s]  Oh my lord. I gotta get rid of this
[13618.09s -> 13619.05s]  guy.
[13619.05s -> 13621.26s]  Use the gun? I can't. This character
[13621.26s -> 13622.94s]  cannot use weapons.
[13622.94s -> 13635.13s]  Another guy with a gun. So that's
[13635.13s -> 13636.09s]  that.
[13636.09s -> 13650.30s]  Any more windows? Yep, plenty of them.
[13650.30s -> 13657.14s]  You're down knowing. Let me take a good
[13657.14s -> 13658.10s]  look at this. So
[13658.10s -> 13660.26s]  there's tons of people with guns.
[13660.26s -> 13663.77s]  There's only one way to get in here.
[13663.77s -> 13665.56s]  I have to go all the way down and
[13665.56s -> 13666.52s]  around. That's the only way I can get
[13666.52s -> 13670.17s]  in there. So I have to go down here.
[13670.17s -> 13672.49s]  Okay, can I like, can I get them to
[13672.49s -> 13673.77s]  run this way?
[13673.77s -> 13679.38s]  I think so. I have to bait them.
[13679.38s -> 13681.69s]  This is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[13681.69s -> 13691.58s]  All right, one more guy with a gun.
[13691.58s -> 13693.58s]  Watch out for that dumb window.
[13693.58s -> 13702.57s]  Oh no, not a window! Am I safe if I run
[13702.57s -> 13708.23s]  up there? No, he's got a gun.
[13708.23s -> 13710.47s]  So if he, okay, if I walk over here and
[13710.47s -> 13712.15s]  these guys see me shoot through,
[13712.15s -> 13714.15s]  but if I run up to this room, this guy
[13714.15s -> 13715.43s]  will shoot me.
[13715.43s -> 13725.88s]  I wonder if I can bait them. Okay, I got
[13725.88s -> 13735.32s]  one.
[13735.32s -> 13738.20s]  Holy shit! Oh my god, my body just,
[13738.20s -> 13741.29s]  I, my whole body hurts. That hurt.
[13741.29s -> 13742.65s]  That actually hurt.
[13742.65s -> 13749.14s]  Okay, just this one guy, but I gotta
[13749.14s -> 13750.50s]  bait this guy because if I run up
[13750.50s -> 13751.62s]  there, I gotta make sure he comes over
[13751.62s -> 13752.34s]  here. Come here.
[13752.34s -> 13758.15s]  All right, here we go. One punch. Last
[13758.15s -> 13758.87s]  guy.
[13758.87s -> 13777.83s]  No, this is not the last guy. Oh,
[13777.83s -> 13780.68s]  cheesing the level. How the hell are
[13780.68s -> 13781.80s]  you supposed to do this on your first
[13781.80s -> 13782.44s]  try?
[13782.44s -> 13784.28s]  I've never played in the game before.
[13784.28s -> 13785.32s]  How the fuck else are you supposed
[13785.32s -> 13807.80s]  to do this?
[13807.80s -> 13813.26s]  Oh damn, get me out of this. Go get
[13813.26s -> 13814.54s]  me out of here.
[13814.54s -> 13819.61s]  I think I heard something. All right,
[13819.61s -> 13821.05s]  fine, finally!
[13821.05s -> 13840.09s]  Can you get the door out of the way?
[13840.09s -> 13845.88s]  Why? Really?
[13845.88s -> 13849.96s]  You're like fucking hack accuracy.
[13850.04s -> 13872.55s]  That's great. Let's go.
[13872.55s -> 13886.12s]  Hmm. What the fuck, man? That's such
[13886.12s -> 13887.08s]  bullshit.
[13887.08s -> 13893.32s]  Honest to god. Oh, that's so infuriating.
[13893.32s -> 13932.02s]  How did he not get cut? Dude, I hate
[13932.02s -> 13933.06s]  the doors. The doors just make the
[13933.06s -> 13960.36s]  enemies fall down and make it harder to kill.
[13960.36s -> 13962.52s]  He's left. The whole second part of
[13962.52s -> 13963.24s]  the level.
[13963.24s -> 13968.02s]  We're, and I don't understand where
[13968.02s -> 13969.14s]  he even came from.
[13969.14s -> 13970.82s]  I just looked over there. I just
[13970.82s -> 13972.34s]  checked.
[13972.34s -> 13993.19s]  He's not even dead. I wish you could
[13993.19s -> 13994.33s]  just shoot him on the ground.
[13994.33s -> 14028.60s]  I really do. How did I not kill him?
[14030.20s -> 14035.21s]  Ah, somebody heard it. I'm dead. I'm so
[14035.21s -> 14038.74s]  dead.
[14038.74s -> 14040.74s]  Hold on, I pressed the razor button.
[14040.74s -> 14042.98s]  Sorry, I pressed it twice apparently.
[14042.98s -> 14052.26s]  Why waste bullets when you can hit
[14052.26s -> 14053.46s]  space and kill them for free? Because the
[14053.46s -> 14055.14s]  animation takes like six seconds to
[14055.14s -> 14060.55s]  kill them.
[14060.55s -> 14061.75s]  When I kill them but they're lying
[14061.75s -> 14062.87s]  on the ground and I press space on
[14062.87s -> 14063.99s]  them, they take, it's like a full
[14063.99s -> 14065.11s]  animation.
[14065.11s -> 14090.58s]  Okay, what's down there? Got any guns
[14090.58s -> 14091.54s]  down there?
[14091.54s -> 14109.62s]  Two guns. Uh, I'm going back up.
[14109.96s -> 14112.44s]  Because I think I got the dog on me.
[14112.44s -> 14116.01s]  I think I'm coming all the way around
[14116.01s -> 14117.61s]  the whole game.
[14117.61s -> 14120.73s]  Goodness.
[14134.76s -> 14137.21s]  Actually, I want to, I'm gonna, let me
[14137.21s -> 14138.49s]  drag the whole fucking level over here.
[14138.49s -> 14139.77s]  Seriously. I'd rather just sit over
[14139.77s -> 14142.46s]  here.
[14142.46s -> 14144.38s]  It's so difficult to even get out
[14144.38s -> 14145.98s]  there and even take two steps
[14145.98s -> 14146.38s]  forward.
[14146.38s -> 14147.90s]  I mean, I just, I wish I could see
[14147.90s -> 14150.06s]  further. Like, ugh.
[14150.06s -> 14173.58s]  That's it. Here comes the dog. All the way
[14173.58s -> 14174.94s]  around the whole game. Come on, all the
[14174.94s -> 14176.86s]  way around. Come on, dog.
[14176.86s -> 14178.84s]  Start from here and make it all the
[14178.84s -> 14180.68s]  way over. You know exactly where I was.
[14180.68s -> 14189.88s]  You could smell me, right? See, my problem
[14189.88s -> 14190.76s]  is just,
[14190.76s -> 14192.76s]  I, walking down this hallway, I might
[14192.76s -> 14194.84s]  just fucking die instantly by the,
[14194.84s -> 14215.50s]  somebody that's over here.
[14215.50s -> 14250.82s]  Hotline Miami 2 in a nutshell?
[14252.87s -> 14256.07s]  Why? Oh my god.
[14256.07s -> 14267.40s]  Did that dog hear that? Bring him on
[14267.40s -> 14269.18s]  over here.
[14269.18s -> 14271.18s]  Oh no, hey, come on. Everyone, bring
[14271.18s -> 14281.64s]  the pets into French.
[14281.64s -> 14292.76s]  Oh, I can't even go over here.
[14292.76s -> 14294.12s]  Shoot? But I don't want to shoot because
[14294.12s -> 14295.40s]  I don't want to bring everybody else
[14295.40s -> 14301.13s]  over here right now.
[14301.13s -> 14309.40s]  Ah, here's the issue. Again, here's the
[14309.40s -> 14312.07s]  same issue from before.
[14312.07s -> 14313.91s]  Am I just gonna step out and die? I
[14313.91s -> 14318.97s]  don't know. I have to go this way.
[14318.97s -> 14320.09s]  There's no other way to go, so I
[14320.09s -> 14321.61s]  have to, I have to, like, sneak in
[14321.61s -> 14323.21s]  this room and not die. Go.
[14323.21s -> 14338.31s]  There's a guy right there, okay. Here
[14338.31s -> 14340.07s]  comes the two guys with the guns.
[14340.07s -> 14341.82s]  I don't want to shoot here because
[14341.82s -> 14343.42s]  it'll pull everybody and it'll be a
[14343.42s -> 14344.46s]  mess.
[14344.46s -> 14356.09s]  I can't see. Did they move? Here they
[14356.09s -> 14357.53s]  are. I'm gonna follow them.
[14361.82s -> 14363.42s]  He's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
[14363.42s -> 14365.18s]  Holy shit, I just turned and clicked and
[14365.18s -> 14375.75s]  spam clicked.
[14375.75s -> 14386.47s]  Fuck, man. This is so ridiculous.
[14386.47s -> 14387.59s]  I know I could do it a different way,
[14387.59s -> 14388.71s]  but I don't care.
[14388.71s -> 14390.31s]  How did he not shoot me? Why did you
[14390.31s -> 14392.15s]  not shoot me? Why, thank God, why did
[14392.15s -> 14399.45s]  you not shoot me?
[14399.45s -> 14408.49s]  But, oh no.
[14408.49s -> 14411.29s]  He fucking was behind him. Oh man, I
[14411.29s -> 14412.73s]  would classify this game
[14412.73s -> 14416.47s]  as extreme difficulty.
[14416.47s -> 14418.31s]  I've played Dark Souls, I've played
[14418.31s -> 14420.39s]  Demon's Souls, I've played them all.
[14420.39s -> 14421.75s]  I would put this one into the category
[14421.75s -> 14426.26s]  of, like, holy fuck difficulty.
[14426.26s -> 14429.14s]  This is extreme. This is extreme
[14429.14s -> 14432.66s]  difficulty.
[14432.66s -> 14434.82s]  And there's a hard mode, holy shit. How
[14434.82s -> 14436.18s]  do you even play that one?
[14436.18s -> 14448.12s]  How do you even do that? I can't
[14448.12s -> 14449.56s]  believe there's a hard difficulty here.
[14449.56s -> 14450.92s]  How the hell, how does that even work?
[14450.92s -> 14452.60s]  You die in one hit anyways.
[14452.60s -> 14478.57s]  I fucking panicked. How do you make
[14478.57s -> 14484.50s]  this game harder? You add enemies?
[14484.50s -> 14486.73s]  What's the hard mode? Guns have
[14486.73s -> 14487.93s]  half as many bullets and there's more
[14487.93s -> 14497.96s]  enemies.
[14497.96s -> 14504.81s]  They're coming. I saw them. Oh, how did
[14504.81s -> 14519.02s]  that not cut through them both?
[14526.78s -> 14549.94s]  Oh my God, oh my God.
[14549.94s -> 14556.42s]  You have to be a corner creeper in this
[14556.42s -> 14557.38s]  game. Did you have to do that in the
[14557.38s -> 14558.82s]  last one? You didn't do this in the
[14558.82s -> 14560.42s]  last game. You didn't have to, like,
[14560.42s -> 14561.78s]  shoot a wall and bait a hundred
[14561.78s -> 14562.90s]  enemies that have guns.
[14562.90s -> 14564.34s]  I don't remember that happening in
[14564.34s -> 14565.78s]  the last one. I just played it two
[14565.78s -> 14566.58s]  days ago.
[14566.58s -> 14599.74s]  Oh fuck.
[14609.11s -> 14612.65s]  There's a dog. Come on up here, dog. Come
[14612.65s -> 14613.37s]  on.
[14613.37s -> 14628.76s]  Just a guy with a bat. Jesus Christ.
[14628.76s -> 14637.34s]  Okay, I don't, I need, I need another
[14637.34s -> 14638.62s]  bullet. I need another gun. Give me
[14638.62s -> 14639.58s]  that gun.
[14639.58s -> 14666.42s]  This is, that was a mistake. What are you
[14666.42s -> 14667.94s]  doing over there? Get over here.
[14667.94s -> 14675.10s]  He's not hearing that? Why are you
[14675.10s -> 14679.64s]  not hearing this?
[14679.64s -> 14707.74s]  Uh, oh, just shoot.
[14707.82s -> 14718.39s]  My goodness. To the roof. We're on the
[14718.39s -> 14720.39s]  roof. How are things going for you guys?
[14720.39s -> 14723.75s]  Hello? Is anyone there? Guys?
[14723.75s -> 14727.43s]  They're not answering. Maybe your walkie
[14727.43s -> 14731.45s]  talkie's busted.
[14731.45s -> 14732.49s]  I don't think so. It seems to be
[14732.49s -> 14734.82s]  working just fine. Should we go back
[14734.82s -> 14737.90s]  and check on them?
[14737.90s -> 14740.94s]  Mmm.
[14752.25s -> 14765.77s]  What the fuck are you waiting for?
[14765.77s -> 14766.97s]  Wait, do I not have access to those
[14766.97s -> 14767.93s]  two characters? They have, like,
[14767.93s -> 14769.53s]  my favorite characters in the game.
[14769.53s -> 14774.54s]  I'm not gonna get D. C.
[14774.54s -> 14775.98s]  Why is it always the level, the levels
[14775.98s -> 14777.34s]  that take me 40 minutes and make me
[14777.34s -> 14778.54s]  the most angry.
[14778.54s -> 14782.63s]  I get Cs on them. Hey, but to be fair,
[14782.63s -> 14783.59s]  let me give myself a little bit of
[14783.59s -> 14784.95s]  credit here.
[14784.95s -> 14786.87s]  40 minutes is the cap, man. That's
[14786.87s -> 14788.71s]  like the hard cap before I hit my
[14788.71s -> 14792.06s]  enrage timer. Don't you understand?
[14792.06s -> 14801.93s]  And then it's just, I beat it. Hey,
[14801.93s -> 14802.89s]  you're not supposed to be here. We've
[14802.89s -> 14811.00s]  got this under control. Sure looks
[14811.00s -> 14813.96s]  like it. I'll take over from here.
[14813.96s -> 14826.94s]  You can't do that. Just watch me.
[14827.02s -> 14828.70s]  That level was the pinwheel of Hotline
[14828.70s -> 14830.62s]  Miami 2. That's bullshit,
[14830.62s -> 14835.51s]  and you all know it. It's fucking hard
[14835.51s -> 14839.45s]  when the game is, the game is,
[14839.45s -> 14842.17s]  start quote, tough as nails, top-down
[14842.17s -> 14844.17s]  shooter that will really test your
[14844.17s -> 14848.73s]  patience, end quote. What do we have
[14848.73s -> 14849.77s]  here? We're in mass. Another set of
[14849.77s -> 14852.17s]  vigilantes, I presume.
[14852.17s -> 14853.45s]  Don't shoot. I give up. I'm through
[14853.45s -> 14855.82s]  with this. Just arrest me and get this
[14855.82s -> 14856.94s]  over with, okay?
[14856.94s -> 14863.90s]  I'm done fighting. Oh, you want your
[14863.90s -> 14865.18s]  15 minutes of fame? Well, I don't
[14865.18s -> 14869.27s]  think so.
[14869.27s -> 14870.47s]  You know what happens to thugs like
[14870.47s -> 14873.56s]  you?
[14875.67s -> 14882.73s]  That's what happens. Are you all right,
[14882.73s -> 14886.49s]  sir? What happened in there?
[14886.49s -> 14887.93s]  He came at me, had to take him out. It
[14887.93s -> 14894.70s]  was him or me. Not even true.
[14894.70s -> 14899.99s]  Looks like my job here is done. I'll
[14899.99s -> 14901.51s]  leave the rest up to you.
[14901.51s -> 14915.70s]  Okay, bye. That's it? That's it,
[14915.70s -> 14919.74s]  apparently, okay.
[14919.74s -> 14935.14s]  Fourth act, falling. So all the
[14935.14s -> 14936.10s]  animals are gone.
[14936.10s -> 14940.82s]  Good morning, honey. I didn't want to
[14940.82s -> 14942.74s]  wake you. Took Jimmy to school, left
[14942.74s -> 14944.34s]  you some breakfast. See you tonight. Love
[14944.34s -> 14945.30s]  Sharon.
[14945.30s -> 14957.40s]  Okay. I'm having trouble
[14957.40s -> 14959.66s]  following the story here.
[14959.66s -> 14962.22s]  We have like a Kingdom Hearts level of
[14962.22s -> 14967.54s]  shit going on.
[14967.54s -> 14970.92s]  Hey, mister. Spare some change?
[14970.92s -> 14975.21s]  Sure, here you go.
[14975.21s -> 14978.14s]  Boy, look like I want your dirty
[14978.14s -> 14979.56s]  money.
[14979.56s -> 14982.04s]  Excuse me? We barely got enough money
[14982.04s -> 14983.32s]  for rent.
[14983.32s -> 14984.76s]  Maybe you should stop trying to be a
[14984.76s -> 14988.44s]  writer. We've got kids to feed.
[14988.44s -> 14991.24s]  We need a real job, dear. This just
[14991.24s -> 14992.60s]  isn't working.
[14992.60s -> 14995.62s]  Sharon, what's going on here? I'll
[14995.62s -> 14996.90s]  leave you. I'll take the kids and
[14996.90s -> 14997.54s]  leave.
[14997.62s -> 14999.30s]  You won't have to do that. This book,
[14999.30s -> 15001.22s]  it's gonna be good, I promise. I need
[15001.22s -> 15002.74s]  more time.
[15002.74s -> 15005.35s]  Time is the one thing you don't have.
[15005.35s -> 15006.55s]  Maybe you should reconsider your
[15006.55s -> 15008.86s]  priorities.
[15008.86s -> 15011.86s]  What are you saying? I said I don't
[15011.86s -> 15021.02s]  want your stinking money.
[15021.02s -> 15029.56s]  Organization 13!
[15029.56s -> 15030.84s]  Oh, I thought we were still on the
[15030.84s -> 15032.28s]  subway. What?
[15032.28s -> 15038.39s]  Well, this is one of those missions
[15038.39s -> 15041.22s]  where I can't kill anybody.
[15041.22s -> 15056.57s]  It's one of those guns. Guns.
[15056.57s -> 15058.49s]  And why would you stop there? Why did
[15058.49s -> 15060.25s]  you stop there? You saw where I went.
[15060.25s -> 15102.25s]  Why would you freeze there?
[15102.25s -> 15118.66s]  Where did you even come from?
[15118.66s -> 15120.98s]  The Green Goblin. That's fine. You can call
[15120.98s -> 15122.42s]  me whatever you want.
[15122.42s -> 15124.94s]  But what the hell? I'm trying to get
[15124.94s -> 15125.90s]  this guy to
[15125.90s -> 15128.62s]  fade over to me. And he just won't do
[15128.62s -> 15129.50s]  it.
[15129.50s -> 15154.02s]  He just won't do it. Guy with a gun?
[15154.02s -> 15156.41s]  Oh, fucking guy with a gun!
[15156.41s -> 15172.49s]  There's another guy right here
[15172.49s -> 15174.89s]  coming over. Come on. I got stuck on
[15174.89s -> 15181.96s]  fucking wall.
[15181.96s -> 15185.43s]  Kill the guys on the ground. I
[15185.43s -> 15186.87s]  thought I'm not supposed to do that.
[15186.87s -> 15189.37s]  Wasn't I specifically not supposed to
[15189.37s -> 15196.92s]  do that?
[15196.92s -> 15198.52s]  Yeah, what are you trying to bait me
[15198.52s -> 15199.48s]  into doing something that I'm not
[15199.48s -> 15203.03s]  supposed to do?
[15203.03s -> 15213.45s]  Really? Don't let yourself succumb to
[15213.45s -> 15214.65s]  the hate. I'm not.
[15214.65s -> 15222.06s]  I'm all right. I can't walk through
[15222.06s -> 15222.94s]  this?
[15222.94s -> 15225.18s]  Oh, there's a very- you have to go
[15225.18s -> 15231.88s]  the right way. I get it.
[15231.88s -> 15237.56s]  Windows. Oh god. All right. This guy's-
[15237.56s -> 15238.76s]  everybody pretty much has a gun in
[15238.76s -> 15239.72s]  that room.
[15239.72s -> 15241.48s]  So if I'm going to bait people, it
[15241.48s -> 15242.68s]  needs to be
[15242.68s -> 15250.14s]  these guys up here. Maybe not. What's
[15250.14s -> 15251.18s]  down here?
[15251.18s -> 15252.86s]  Nothing. All right. There's a safe spot
[15252.86s -> 15253.98s]  over here.
[15253.98s -> 15262.02s]  All right. What about- is there any that-
[15262.02s -> 15263.86s]  they can come through there?
[15263.86s -> 15275.64s]  They're already aiming over here. What's
[15275.64s -> 15277.64s]  up here?
[15277.64s -> 15282.12s]  Aye aye aye. Aye aye aye.
[15282.12s -> 15283.72s]  Give me a break. I did it too and
[15283.72s -> 15284.84s]  I clicked it and I
[15284.84s -> 15293.42s]  fucking clicked it. What happened there?
[15293.42s -> 15294.70s]  What happened there twice?
[15294.70s -> 15298.46s]  Two times. Twice. Two. Two times.
[15298.46s -> 15322.39s]  All right, there's three guys. Where's this other guy going?
[15322.39s -> 15344.98s]  i don't want to go through the turnstile now he can see me from there
[15354.52s -> 15365.98s]  this is our turf now boys let's tear it up what's that okay well is somebody in like a mech suit

[17545.37s -> 17548.97s]  like hey by the way don't die on the third floor because it ruins the rest of the
[17548.97s -> 17552.39s]  game and it is a cutscene you're gonna miss i don't want to know that i mean i
[17552.39s -> 17581.10s]  just lost whatever i'm not gonna talk got any last words asshole that's it isn't that the
[17581.10s -> 17594.09s]  equivalent of like just telling me spoilers for the game because if i do know that then i'm gonna
[17594.09s -> 17597.61s]  hope i would like play differently i probably would still have lost so you didn't is not like a
[17597.61s -> 17614.74s]  i probably still would have lost don't die game ruined well it wasn't don't die it was
[17614.74s -> 17619.30s]  apparently specifically don't die on the third floor don't die on the third floor do not die

[17711.43s -> 17716.15s]  until they tell us what to do and how to do it no will of our own just mindless obedience
[17716.15s -> 17719.75s]  we don't even know why we're fighting now do we only knows that the deep down somewhere
[17719.75s -> 17722.31s]  in there we just enjoy destruction and violence it's just part of our nature

[21412.84s -> 21437.69s]  fucking 12 damn it man in a world where it's it's so hard to like actually
[21438.49s -> 21442.49s]  i've run over the gun like three times and try to pick it up it just picks up another
[21442.49s -> 21478.86s]  item what in the name of fucking god does it keep doing that for why rush the guy with the
[21478.86s -> 21522.07s]  gun he has a he has a gun it's fucking locked onto him too and i can't understand why it

[21549.98s -> 21559.34s]  where are you going you gotta be close enough to throw it at him but it's an open fucking
[21559.34s -> 21566.66s]  area it's just open everybody can just look at you i gotta be close enough to throw this at him
[21567.22s -> 21597.93s]  and then just run to him okay what kind of level is this by the way what is this like
[21597.93s -> 21603.29s]  level design it's just a giant fucking all it what there's no level here where are we
[21603.29s -> 21615.80s]  oh we're on a roof what is this why these people where the couches where the tvs
[21616.44s -> 21656.54s]  and it hit the fucking wall and bounced off and just stopped oh my god i gotta i have to
[21656.54s -> 21662.89s]  just like go i have to go like this just move in fucking erratic patterns no it doesn't matter
[21665.02s -> 21669.74s]  kill three melee and wait but i have to be close enough to throw the thing at him
[21671.99s -> 21676.71s]  if once i get to a point where i'm close enough to throw it at him i'm just dead every time
[21682.04s -> 21685.82s]  it didn't even it didn't even matter that time there are other doors i can't use the other
[21685.82s -> 21707.86s]  doors look they cannot be used i can't go over there and get it it was no there's only
[21707.86s -> 21727.62s]  two bullets in that gun any of the guns oh why this is so fucking painful it's like got you

[21742.12s -> 21745.72s]  it's very easy when you run over and press the pickup the only thing that exists it's all it's
[21745.72s -> 21768.17s]  pick up weapon on ground stop locking on and throwing it well what how else do i make sure
[21768.17s -> 21816.63s]  i could like get it on him and sometimes he just runs over here no fuck he's got that like
[21816.63s -> 21819.91s]  bodyguard with him to try to like ambush him around the corner it's like you run into the
[21819.91s -> 21828.60s]  fat guy and the fat guy just punches you why did this game turn into like hitman go by the way
[21828.60s -> 21849.67s]  like what happened hug the wall you talk about like when he comes down here hug this wall but

[22065.64s -> 22101.14s]  oh this is the maddest you've ever seen me it's because this game is fucking ridiculous mad
[22101.14s -> 22109.10s]  because bad yeah sure sure i wonder what your first playthrough looked like that's where let's
[22109.10s -> 22114.38s]  let's let's see your video of you playing the first time huh i think you did a thousand
[22114.38s -> 22140.92s]  fucking times all right back up hey i beat it already what's your excuse i'm my monitor don't
[22140.92s -> 22157.51s]  that's not funny the like monitor falling backwards is not like a thing i want to do
[22157.51s -> 22187.62s]  tonight all right where's that there's a dog did the dog is dead and the guys just rushed
[22187.62s -> 22192.26s]  it and what why do the other guys don't come in i don't get it why do these guys all don't
[22192.26s -> 22217.85s]  run in just the guy these people heard that somehow turn the brightness up give me that
[22217.85s -> 22238.52s]  gun same deal all right now give me something better than this the shotgun is all right i don't
[22238.52s -> 22244.82s]  the shotgun i'm not a fan of the shotgun i mean look at how many guns are just pointed at this
[22244.82s -> 22254.74s]  door it might be better off just going around here but it's gonna it's gonna pull everybody
[22259.14s -> 22269.99s]  i'm gonna have to know but as these guys will shoot me too i really don't i don't know i
[22269.99s -> 22280.55s]  think it's just kind of pick them off from here all right there's only a couple left
[22288.30s -> 22291.50s]  question is when i shoot this guy i think i'm gonna go through here
[22294.86s -> 22297.50s]  give me a break i fucking can't believe that didn't kill them all
[22299.06s -> 22313.85s]  god damn it it's just so many reflexes in a second time just takes like a quarter of a second
[22313.85s -> 22333.06s]  he's dead and stuck on the fucking wall use fists when they rush you when they are all
[22333.06s -> 22345.74s]  shooting guns at you you would use fists you want to use fists when they when the seven or
[22345.74s -> 22364.71s]  eight people with a shotgun you punch much faster they're rushing through the door you
[22364.79s -> 22378.07s]  instead of shooting just punch um how how much is actually left in the game
[22378.07s -> 22385.10s]  before i literally strangled myself but how many more levels are there do you think how many are
[22385.10s -> 22411.74s]  there like six the six more chapters to this game you're on the first level i dropped it
[22413.30s -> 22418.30s]  i can't i couldn't see where it was on the ground rage quit well is it a rage quit if
[22418.30s -> 22425.06s]  the game is like 10 hours long and six hours of this is like mind melting you can't you
[22425.06s -> 22439.86s]  don't have to be the whole thing in one sitting they heard that i gotta get i'm turning the camera
[22440.82s -> 22466.22s]  i gotta go camels yeah i'm losing it it actually might actually i think i might
[22466.22s -> 22487.59s]  have to take a break build a gun where's the fat guy go my lord take a blip break and play
[22487.59s -> 22528.68s]  katamari damacy no if i take a break i'm not playing this game again tonight dog he's did he
[22528.68s -> 22533.88s]  actually see me through the fucking door is there a gun all right that gotta be dead let
[22533.96s -> 22545.35s]  me i'm gonna try it let me a few more times this is the nightmare scenario that this that's this
[22545.35s -> 22548.95s]  room and then you got to punch my fucking right weapon at the problem shoot shoot shoot it's just
[22548.95s -> 22562.68s]  blah i this is a silenced gun though okay there goes that guy once somebody shoots here it's
[22562.68s -> 22573.27s]  over let me what's down here no i'll get i'll get caught up in there i gotta go this way i
[22573.27s -> 22590.87s]  think oh fuck all right it's okay there's only one guy with a gun here but that door is
[22590.87s -> 22601.54s]  open now i only have three bullets before everyone's gonna hear me i gotta make these count
[22606.52s -> 22613.08s]  all right one more shot i want to get the guy with the gun oh fuck that guy that guy came in
[22613.08s -> 22625.35s]  the room that guy's got a gun i should be able to get rid of him nobody else in there right
[22625.35s -> 22650.23s]  that's it i think he can see right he can jesus no oh man oh man oh man fucking hell
[22658.41s -> 22668.66s]  wow okay you know how if you go to the playstation trophies menu thing and you go to like how many
[22668.66s -> 22674.57s]  people got to like the cleric beast and bloodborne i wonder what that looks like for this game
[22676.39s -> 22706.98s]  seriously claret yeah claret beast is the first boss i just i need like a shotgun and i'm just
[22706.98s -> 22713.02s]  gonna bring them in here and see if i can just clear it out i feel like that's been a shit
[22713.02s -> 22717.51s]  load of this game though am i crazier to think that oh let me just like go like this
[22717.59s -> 22725.56s]  and bring everybody in here i is that like you know what i mean shoot and then they just sit here
[22740.17s -> 22771.18s]  this seems to be the strat for this game okay i i guess i mean i eventually i'm gonna do this
[22771.18s -> 22794.26s]  i don't know i'm gonna pull everybody over here all right this big guy don't just stoop
[22794.26s -> 22799.64s]  don't just shoot i missed him all right i got one fucking bullet make it count and i hit the
[22799.64s -> 22822.66s]  fucking door god damn it man and hit the fucking door like give me a break that's unbelievable
[22837.62s -> 22841.38s]  that's the strategy most people use and complain about but take it from someone who's done s
[22841.38s -> 22846.97s]  rank on every level that's not how you do it well if most people do it like this isn't that
[22846.97s -> 22853.45s]  potentially a problem with the game itself you know i mean if like most people do it
[22853.45s -> 22861.43s]  like this isn't that kind of like a shouldn't it not be like that i don't remember doing
[22861.43s -> 22870.34s]  this i do not remember doing this type of shit in the first game this game's a lot of
[22870.34s -> 22874.74s]  fun i'm like having i'm having a good time i think the game's like a very fun it's fun to
[22874.74s -> 22890.60s]  like run around rooms grab grab what's next but like shooting a wall so people run into the
[22890.60s -> 22917.50s]  room i mean like what the heck is that fuck i didn't have i gotta stop picking up the
[22917.50s -> 22963.94s]  shotgun damn it i want to at least get to the end of this level i feel like i'll do
[22963.94s -> 22991.22s]  it eventually no again i did it again i wish i would didn't drop the gun when i do that how
[22991.22s -> 23012.58s]  good why am i doing that try this again all right i mean that room is clear nobody in this
[23012.58s -> 23048.39s]  one this is the guy up here i gotta be careful big guy two big guys left nobody in that up top
[23048.39s -> 23054.76s]  room okay i gotta i just gotta shoot them once i might even just pull it back no i should be
[23054.76s -> 23065.05s]  able to get it okay that leaves these two guys up top which there's line of sight here
[23067.51s -> 23076.76s]  holy fuck i almost lost it okay i'm not i'm not enough why would i do that right now
[23078.41s -> 23086.25s]  don't make any like dumb jokes they're almost done with this part oh my god oh my reaction times
[23086.25s -> 23094.42s]  are so slow they're so slow right now my brain is to process like 400 milliseconds of lag
[23096.39s -> 23110.52s]  it's serious i just saw that guy and it was like please shoot guy oh okay oh there's only
[23110.60s -> 23127.83s]  one more guy with a gun and i've got to get him first got it okay done oh my goodness gracious
[23129.72s -> 23135.16s]  again like we talked about before man like i've got to give it up to the people that can play
[23135.16s -> 23144.15s]  this fucking game that well how it is like it's it's so ridiculous i'm gonna watch tonight like
[23144.15s -> 23148.31s]  youtube videos of guys beating this in five seconds i'm gonna be like what the fuck happened
[23149.11s -> 23186.14s]  you're you're like made out of other material besides brain matter what happened here where
[23186.14s -> 23192.31s]  are we going are you oh you're going i'm about to put i'm about to put you in the trunk
[23198.33s -> 23200.41s]  no that's not the person that was in the trunk at the beginning of the game
[23200.97s -> 23212.22s]  that's your mom okay where am i
[23214.66s -> 23215.46s]  oh shit
[23227.82s -> 23230.06s]  i'm sorry i'm like i'm fucking fading
[23235.64s -> 23239.62s]  so do we go somewhere do i put her on the couch
[23244.41s -> 23258.82s]  okay stop doing that to me game put mom in front of the tv put mom in the chair put mom
[23259.80s -> 23270.17s]  in a sofa mom where do you want to go i don't know where mom wants me to put her oh i need
[23270.17s -> 23291.94s]  to go over there oh okay here you go mom stop getting stuck on the stairs i must have passed
[23291.94s -> 23295.40s]  out i was going to take a bath and then i don't remember what happened are you okay you
[23295.40s -> 23299.56s]  want me to call the doctor no please don't i'm fine i swear just a bit cold and tired i'll be
[23299.56s -> 23304.04s]  good as new in the morning are you sure you don't look too good i'm sure a cough i'd like to get
[23304.04s -> 23316.98s]  some sleep now if you don't mind you got one new message hi there this is dan from bush and
[23316.98s -> 23322.18s]  flower we've got some gardening work for you uptown a nice old house up on 66 shouldn't be
[23322.18s -> 23327.40s]  too hard it's pretty straightforward you'll know when you see it just put your suit on
[23328.12s -> 23354.17s]  click 682 deaths house call right through the window actually if i'm quick enough
[23355.69s -> 23374.95s]  oh plenty plenty of windows i'm thinking through this door over on the right this whole thing is
[23374.95s -> 23390.82s]  a window that we got there's a guy with a gun down here gun lots of guns not really safe
[23390.82s -> 23422.02s]  anywhere huh is this covered i don't think it is whoops a daisy is this cover no no i'm done
[23422.58s -> 23439.77s]  i just want to see what this level was about the door is covered though i fold them so i got
[23439.77s -> 23448.62s]  a gun hold on all right like the video game what the hell was that what was going on in that
[23448.62s -> 23467.77s]  video game there watch out for the window although i can do it too but not a good idea
[23468.41s -> 23498.86s]  does that guy have a gun no okay machine gun machine gun can get in this room over here
[23498.86s -> 23506.50s]  let's get it i thought that was gonna bump into him but apparently not empty give me
[23506.50s -> 23515.30s]  another gun all right we got one two i might be able to knock this guy out that's risky
[23515.30s -> 23540.98s]  just shoot him okay got it oh i couldn't do that oops wow okay wow i gotta get that out of his hand
[23540.98s -> 23553.78s]  right now give me the give it oh i fucking threw it whoops fuck no i don't want to get on top
[23553.78s -> 23573.78s]  of them okay i figured it out i gotta get the gun i gotta um god damn i think it was a big
[23573.78s -> 23581.22s]  guy no shit okay i know i know what i gotta do just gotta be careful big guy comes out
[23581.22s -> 23598.62s]  shoot him with a shotgun where did the guy with the gun come from okay watch it for that
[23598.62s -> 23616.76s]  guy with the gun i don't think i have any bolts damn what do i do about this guy thought i hit
[23616.76s -> 23637.61s]  him with the what's over on the left i wish i could see i could throw it up there but i don't
[23637.61s -> 23641.98s]  know if that's a good idea because if i run in there somebody could probably shoot me from up
[23641.98s -> 23660.89s]  here damn it and then it doesn't even matter damn it where did you come from whoa okay i
[23660.89s -> 23668.36s]  got it but i don't have any guns okay this is not a bad spot to be in i just got to
[23668.36s -> 23678.41s]  shoot this guy once i got it i got it okay that guy in there is gone but what's all the okay that's
[23678.41s -> 23691.91s]  the end of the level gun gun gun i don't think nobody has a gun that guy has a gun
[23694.15s -> 23709.18s]  that guy does have a gun doesn't he no more guns just this guy no there's a gun up there
[23709.18s -> 23727.67s]  okay i got it i actually fucking yeah i shot the guy back there okay it's just a bunch
[23727.67s -> 23735.88s]  of chumps in fact give me a melee weapon because there's no reason for me to you
[23736.12s -> 23740.95s]  actually give me this i'm more comfortable with this thing right now so we've got a bunch of
[23740.95s -> 23747.14s]  guys over here i'm just going to try to get this dude in fact i'm going to get this guy
[23747.14s -> 23775.30s]  with a melee no i'm not just okay wish me luck there's nothing else right are there
[23775.30s -> 23804.18s]  is there no secrets in this game either plenty of secret shit get ready for the best level
[23806.81s -> 23813.86s]  all right am i am i missing something here what what why am i lost already over there exit
[23813.86s -> 23830.76s]  the game now exit the game now he's gonna quit on this one this is where i either break or i
[23830.76s -> 23839.75s]  transcend hold on a second gotta go fetch another notepad not not yet i'm i mean i'm
[23839.75s -> 23842.63s]  getting it to that point where i'm starting to feel it i know we're getting it's getting
[23842.63s -> 23853.34s]  really late it's like 2 a.m eastern right now let's see if i let's see if i transcend
[23853.34s -> 23859.30s]  okay i'm gonna give myself like 10 attempts to transcend and then i'm gonna i'm gonna call it
[23859.86s -> 23872.57s]  because i don't know how much longer my brain can think 10 is so few all right 20 i'm back
[23873.88s -> 23877.48s]  so i'm in there just waiting for the trial to start and i can tell you time moves slow when
[23877.48s -> 23889.50s]  you're locked up this one day i get a visit that's one of these good afternoon who are you
[23890.14s -> 23899.18s]  i told you he wouldn't recognize us why are you here tying up some blue sense just a
[23899.18s -> 23903.90s]  little precaution seems like it wasn't really necessary i'm afraid i don't understand oh we
[23903.90s -> 23912.07s]  didn't expect you to while we're here we might as well say our goodbyes goodbyes yes after all
[23912.07s -> 23922.90s]  you served us well but it looks like your time's up now do i recognize them um you figured out
[23922.90s -> 23933.56s]  i'm sure it was nice seeing you again but i'm afraid it's time for us to leave is it the
[23933.56s -> 23972.47s]  janitor you take care 20th scene release the hell say your prayers asshole no no no no wait
[23973.11s -> 23984.89s]  all right people are throwing bottles so i used to get hit in the head with a bottle right
[23985.53s -> 24021.70s]  i'm just gonna oh my lord oh what was that fucking hitbox survive you must transcend
[24023.43s -> 24046.31s]  like it's hard to transcend whoa somebody's threw back i did it what the fuck is happening
[24047.42s -> 24065.85s]  okay what oh boy so i just have to escape i just have to escape right
[24066.49s -> 24128.10s]  everybody the gun all right i think i think i'm at my boiling point i think i've reached the
[24128.10s -> 24153.06s]  point where i'm done for tonight holy fuck we made a lot of progress yeah i i don't know if
[24153.06s -> 24165.50s]  i can handle this one right now this isn't even the worst room why jesus what the hell
[24166.46s -> 24187.26s]  fuck who's left up there okay i'm safe to go down here i can get into the gun i got stuck
[24187.26s -> 24194.92s]  it's all right i'm fine all right oh they can shoot through the window fuck god the window
[24194.92s -> 24203.18s]  oh my lord now this is it it's the last try but streaming this game again it's like what an
[24203.18s -> 24232.66s]  hour or two left of the whole game just all right let me ask you this is this the like
[24232.66s -> 24242.76s]  hardest part of this part of the game just it's the six more all right yeah then i'll do it
[24242.76s -> 24256.31s]  another night before i actually fucking go crazy all right now's the time as any
[24262.60s -> 24273.06s]  transcendence delayed when are you gonna do it again um so the plan here yeah i gotta i gotta
[24273.06s -> 24293.74s]  stop unfortunately it really is too much for my brain right now it's about seven hours
[24294.38s -> 24299.82s]  or i might even you know like it might i might even just do no it's like 11 30
[24300.38s -> 24307.91s]  that's it's time to go so let me go with the plan so i'm not going to be streaming
[24308.95s -> 24318.02s]  tomorrow or tuesday because monday and tuesday here i want to set up completely hopefully
[24318.74s -> 24325.88s]  their work days to get the christmas stream ready to go so i will not see you guys until
[24325.88s -> 24333.75s]  wednesday and we will just probably we'll probably just come back to this and try to
[24333.75s -> 24346.22s]  finish it 739 deaths i can't even that's a number i can't count to and depending on
[24346.22s -> 24351.42s]  how long that takes us and depending on where that goes can you die one more time yeah that's
[24351.42s -> 24380.57s]  okay that was way more than one all right that's gonna be it thanks everybody for coming out
[24387.93s -> 24392.97s]  getting addicted yeah it's getting really really late this time to go i had a lot of fun i
[24392.97s -> 24399.18s]  did the game's a great game but if you want my honest true opinion i think hotline may
[24399.18s -> 24407.80s]  be one is like a more fun game it's almost it feels like hotline miami 1 was a lot of fun
[24407.80s -> 24412.54s]  and it was hard but then they made hotline miami 2 and they were just like hey let's let's just
[24412.54s -> 24421.24s]  make it even more ridiculous because i i loved hotline miami 1 that was like a fun great
[24421.24s -> 24425.48s]  experience i it was frustrating sometimes but i feel like some of the levels in this game
[24425.48s -> 24434.74s]  were just like designed to just make you hate yourself it's still really fun though like
[24434.82s -> 24444.89s]  you see i kind of can't stop playing it and if you like more of a extreme kind of challenge if
[24444.89s -> 24453.85s]  you like more challenge than one then absolutely i think they're both great games i think they're
[24453.85s -> 24472.02s]  definitely both worth playing for sure but yeah that's my opinion on it i think i'm definitely
[24472.02s -> 24483.54s]  going to finish it and i definitely would give it a recommend but yeah uh let's do the oh we
[24483.54s -> 24490.97s]  got a lot of bits holy shit there's there there's like a there's a lot of you guys
[24490.97s -> 24512.10s]  give a lot of money tonight holy fuck 158 000 dollars raised so far with hashtag charity all
[24512.10s -> 24516.34s]  right so here's what we're going to do because uh because it is so late i'm going to quickly
[24516.34s -> 24522.34s]  go through the bits so i'm not going to read very many messages i will try to pick out some

[25903.82s -> 25908.46s]  frequently 2 is a disappointment because of all the open corridors windows and out of sight
[25908.46s -> 25914.06s]  enemies as well as your inability to choose your mask but you can always replay 1 hashtag
[25914.06s -> 25925.18s]  charity thank you yeah i mean i've i set my piece on the two games it kind of just feels
[25925.18s -> 25935.16s]  like they tried to dial two up like like really like all the way and i mean it's just
[25935.72s -> 25943.05s]  a challenge for people and that's you know that's the way it is you could choose the mask uh
[25943.05s -> 25948.33s]  only in a couple of missions i think there really was only about two or three missions
[25948.33s -> 25959.85s]  so far and i've been up there's only two masks i even had the whole time but yeah i feel
[25959.85s -> 25967.43s]  like that opinion is not like an unpopular one though to say that i don't know how split is like
[25967.43s -> 25974.01s]  the hotline miami community people that like love these games it does kind of feel like i
[25974.01s -> 25995.94s]  love people like two more i love two for the story not the gameplay it's pretty split i love
[25995.94s -> 25999.30s]  two but it's more frustrating just still split there's a split it seems it's a good game
[25999.30s -> 26002.26s]  but the first one yeah it seems like there's a lot of people that like it that's why
[26003.22s -> 26017.35s]  you know it's they're both good games i personally i think i enjoyed one more if one had like a few
[26017.35s -> 26024.25s]  more levels then i would probably put it if it's just there's so much more in two it seems like
[26024.25s -> 26037.53s]  at this point but i'm not sure but almost done thank you to graveyard ghoul for the
