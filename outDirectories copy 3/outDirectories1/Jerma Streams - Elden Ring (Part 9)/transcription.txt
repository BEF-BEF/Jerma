[4.47s -> 14.52s]  Oh, hey, how are you? How's it going? How have you been? It's been a little while since we've
[14.52s -> 32.07s]  last seen each other's faces. I'm here. Good. Well, relatively good. Relatively good. Did I,
[32.07s -> 42.84s]  did I just send a tweet and like reply to somebody? I hope not. Did I in my speed reply to somebody's,
[42.84s -> 50.33s]  like on my timeline to say that I was streaming? That'd be so fucked up. Ah, we're good.
[51.29s -> 55.24s]  Yes. Hello. You haven't seen me in over a week. There's a few reasons for that.
[55.96s -> 63.80s]  One, if you didn't catch the streamer awards, I was there. It was a really good time. I got to meet
[63.80s -> 68.55s]  and network Andy with a bunch of people. Some people that I have already met and already knew,
[69.11s -> 71.99s]  but some people I'd never met before and that was the first time I've ever really
[72.79s -> 85.08s]  said hello. It was a very, very good time. This is the guy that won two awards. Yeah, I, I get,
[85.08s -> 89.80s]  hey, you know what? I guess so. I guess that, I guess I am, I am that person, aren't I?
[90.60s -> 99.06s]  It's time to flex a little, okay? 2022, no more like humble. No, I'm, I'm putting on a fucking
[99.06s -> 113.96s]  muscle shirt and I'm flexing now. See what I'm talking about? I'm not, I'm not ready. I'm not
[113.96s -> 122.58s]  ready yet. Hold on. No, in all seriousness, I, there's a really, really tough category in both
[122.58s -> 129.38s]  categories. I, it was a really great time. It was really fun to be there. Anybody could have won
[129.38s -> 136.98s]  those two categories. Seriously. And they're all cool people. I've met pretty much all of them
[136.98s -> 145.61s]  besides the ones that weren't there. You need to explain Peppa Pig. They handed out coloring books
[145.61s -> 154.79s]  so I started coloring. I didn't bring a Peppa Pig coloring book to the streamer awards. They
[154.79s -> 168.36s]  handed them out. Why am I good at public speaking? I don't, I don't know. Okay. You want to know how
[168.36s -> 173.93s]  to actually public speak. You just have to pretend that everybody in the audience is your friend
[174.65s -> 180.44s]  and they're all there to let, you're just hanging out with your friends. That's one of the best ways
[180.44s -> 185.77s]  to do it. You just literally pretend that everybody in the audience is like, oh yeah, I'm talking to
[185.77s -> 192.25s]  like, I'm talking to Burger Boy. Yeah, he's just, it's all Burger Boys. It's just, it's just a
[192.25s -> 198.30s]  audience full of Burger Boy, which I would definitely not recommend. I would definitely,
[198.30s -> 202.95s]  I would probably not attend that event. I would, I would hope that event would be like streamed so
[202.95s -> 211.90s]  I could watch from a distance. I would not want to go to that event. But no, honest to God, I don't
[211.90s -> 217.67s]  know. I don't think I'm really that good at public speaking. Just have something that you think you
[217.67s -> 221.99s]  really want to say and just say it and be, and confidently say the things that you want to say,
[221.99s -> 229.64s]  I guess. I was kind of nervous. It was, it's kind of nerve wracking, you know, going up there and
[230.36s -> 236.07s]  it's just a sea of people that you know are, these people are, there's a lot of people in
[236.07s -> 242.54s]  this audience right now and a lot of them are like big streamers and people from the press.
[242.54s -> 245.66s]  It's like, I don't want to like, I don't want to have like a booger come out of my nose and go into
[245.66s -> 253.26s]  my mouth in the middle of that like speech because then that's it. The second that astray booger goes
[253.26s -> 260.44s]  out into mouth and I go, it's like, okay, I gotta, it's time to quit. So like every time before you,
[260.44s -> 265.00s]  before public speaking is, I mean, maybe I'm a weirdo. Like I always like make sure there's
[265.00s -> 270.23s]  nothing in my nose. I always make sure my teeth, my like teeth are okay. There's no like, there's
[270.23s -> 276.79s]  no like boogers in my nose because I don't know, it's possible. Even if it's a 0.01% chance,
[278.50s -> 282.74s]  that will be your legacy. Eating a booger accidentally on camera during a speech.
[283.38s -> 303.70s]  You're taking notes. What? No, I'm just fucking kidding. I'm like, God, relax. Thick nose,
[303.70s -> 308.50s]  Andy. I do that before coming on here too. You guys don't think that I make sure that I look
[308.50s -> 318.46s]  clean? Anyways, I've been so, so ready to play Elden Ring. You have no idea. I'm gonna tell you
[318.46s -> 325.78s]  just how accurate that statement is. Um, so I've been, last week I've had digestive problems.
[325.78s -> 330.90s]  Those of you that don't know, I got diagnosed with like colitis and then proctitis and they thought
[330.90s -> 335.86s]  it was Crohn's originally, right? Like I've, I've had IBD bullshit for the last like 15, 20 years
[335.86s -> 341.30s]  almost. Uh, I, I got a flare up. I don't know why. Sometimes every, maybe once every like,
[341.30s -> 346.44s]  maybe once twice a year it ends up happening. Stomach. Well, it's not really stomach. I don't
[346.44s -> 353.48s]  want to pretend like it's a stomach thing. Uh, I have problems with my digestive track. So, um,
[353.48s -> 359.72s]  how long are we going tonight? As long as I can without needing to run away. Uh, I think I should
[359.72s -> 364.60s]  be good. If I need to take a break somewhere in a few hours, uh, see I'll do what kind of like we
[364.60s -> 371.05s]  did last time, which is actually a pretty good idea. Uh, but I have also in the meantime,
[371.05s -> 375.96s]  because if you see where we are right now, I have not moved on this character.
[375.96s -> 383.83s]  I've probably played through Limgrave like eight times because I just want to play so bad. I've
[383.83s -> 391.21s]  seen, I have seen every last detail of Limgrave. Everyone. I could tell you if you open a book,
[391.21s -> 395.83s]  have you opened up just a naked map of Limgrave? Nothing there. I could tell you where every
[395.83s -> 399.67s]  grace is. I could tell you where every dungeon is. I could tell you where every, wherever every NPC
[399.67s -> 405.66s]  is. I just want to play so bad. So I was like, I don't want to see too much though, but uh,
[405.66s -> 410.23s]  I guess I'll make a new character and go through Limgrave again. And it's like, Jesus, man,
[410.23s -> 414.58s]  I'm just glad to see something that's not like the tree sentinel. You know what I mean? You need
[414.58s -> 418.65s]  to prove it. I don't have to prove anything. No, cause then like I'll miss something and people
[418.65s -> 424.73s]  will be mad. All right. Anyways, here's what we're doing. You remember this guy, baby rattle?
[424.73s -> 432.09s]  It's, it's the, it's, you need to play with me strong. I'm not going to play with me strong.
[433.03s -> 442.47s]  No, no audio. Fuck. There you go. How come the characters are furry? The characters.
[442.47s -> 445.67s]  No, it's a stick of furry statue mask. Fine. I'll give you that.
[445.67s -> 452.09s]  You promised me strong. I did not promise anything.
[453.37s -> 458.49s]  We laughed about a scenario where, because me strong is supposed to be just a naked guy with
[458.49s -> 464.71s]  a club. And I want to try to just put every single point in strength and get the huge club
[464.71s -> 470.04s]  and just be a caveman running around. And everyone was like, oh, that's really funny. And it's like,
[470.04s -> 475.90s]  well, what if you were inebriated? I guess that makes it funnier that I'm just this guy with no
[475.90s -> 485.90s]  health and like 80 strength and try to kill the bosses in like four hits and die. Like a fucking
[485.90s -> 492.17s]  caveman just running around. That's like the thing that people need to be concerned about.
[492.17s -> 503.64s]  Oh, tarnished. It's just a naked guy with a club. All right. Hit the thing. Me mad. Yeah.
[504.57s -> 510.17s]  All right. So I have to remember kind of what, what I did last. And what I remember is I remember
[510.25s -> 513.13s]  I was in a, I was, I was, I was in a state of a little bit of delirious.
[514.25s -> 520.65s]  I remember you guys were like, it was like hour number 12 or something. And I was exhausted. And
[520.65s -> 525.69s]  I couldn't, I couldn't even like read and you guys are like, oh, keep going, keep going. And I was
[525.69s -> 531.05s]  like, all right, fine. I'll keep going. And I killed a boss. And then I, it was like, no,
[531.05s -> 536.26s]  keep running up the tree. And I like ran up the tree and I killed another boss. Well, I didn't.
[536.26s -> 543.61s]  The mimic tier did. Then they nerfed it. So that's not happening anymore. Ludwig wants to play
[543.61s -> 552.23s]  Fortnite with you. We're doing a thing in a week or so. Hey, you want, you want to see my games
[552.23s -> 561.21s]  that I might be picking for this little event? I wonder what I might be. I'm wait, is Ludwig picking
[561.21s -> 573.86s]  Fortnite? That's not one of the games Ludwig is doing, right? It's not Fortnite. Oh God. Okay.
[573.86s -> 582.82s]  Well, I got, I got a few picks myself. Okay. So I, that'll be interesting though. All right. I need
[582.82s -> 588.90s]  to figure out it's, it's been a while. Okay. So my entire experience so far, the last like nine days
[588.90s -> 597.86s]  has been this area and maybe like a little bit of here, but I, I kind of like have a ton of time
[598.42s -> 603.62s]  that I like, my hard drive got overwritten because I just, all I know is Limgrave.
[603.62s -> 611.51s]  Everything else got deleted. So I believe the last thing that I did, I killed Morgoth and then I like
[611.51s -> 617.45s]  turned the stream off. So let's just, let me just, let me just go here, right? Yeah. I couldn't get
[617.45s -> 622.82s]  into the urn tree. And then that lady sat down and she was like, Oh, we can get in there eventually.
[622.82s -> 628.82s]  I guess if you go here, right? Oh, wait, no, no, no. It was marked. Okay. So this is where I need to
[628.82s -> 639.05s]  go, but is that where I'm going to go? This is a Limgrave expert. I would say so, but this is where
[639.05s -> 647.77s]  I have to go. But is that where necessarily I'm going? What is this? The rolled route. I'm going
[647.77s -> 652.25s]  to be very honest. There was a bunch of shit in this Capitol that I did not see and I really want
[652.25s -> 664.49s]  to see it. I'm level 98. Oh, I'm almost, do I have any crunchies? Oh shit. I have this. Oh, wait,
[665.53s -> 672.57s]  I did just like fucking turn the stream off. Didn't I? I did. I didn't even go back to the,
[672.57s -> 682.97s]  to the round table. Okay. Go explore the Capitol. Yeah, I was going to go do that first.
[682.97s -> 689.85s]  This is also going to be a long one. And I'll tell you why, because I'm not sure if I'm going
[689.85s -> 695.38s]  to be able to scream tomorrow. The idea was to stream tomorrow, do like more Elden Ring,
[695.38s -> 701.78s]  because I'm an Elden Ring streamer. It's the only thing I play. So, you know, you go to the
[701.78s -> 710.26s]  volcano. Okay. So I might, we might do a super stream today, at least like eight to 10 hours.
[710.26s -> 716.76s]  I want to play Elden Ring. You know what I mean? Like I don't, I am, my body is going to have to
[716.76s -> 723.05s]  backseat here. I want to play Elden Ring and I want to play it on stream. So if I have to diarrhea,
[724.02s -> 732.23s]  PMI. How did I just say that? It's been like nine days since I've streamed. I forgot. Like,
[732.23s -> 738.87s]  I can't say everything on stream. I forgot. Like sometimes I forget that like there's a camera on
[738.87s -> 741.91s]  me and there's like a bunch of people here. But you know what I mean? Like if I have to go and
[741.91s -> 747.19s]  get like a drink, if I have to like go like take a quick PRB, then I, then maybe I will, whatever.
[747.19s -> 767.18s]  Who cares? I'm going to be fine. What did he just say? It's you. Pay me any mind. It's not him.
[767.18s -> 781.27s]  Just lay out your arms. Oh shit. Oh, we got something to talk about here. They buffed the
[781.27s -> 790.70s]  fuck out of Sorcery. Sorcery got a massive buff. Almost every spell. So if you don't know,
[790.70s -> 796.78s]  Patch 1.03 came out. They nerfed a few things. By the way, this, this is not one of the things
[796.78s -> 803.51s]  that they nerfed. I saw a lot of people that were very upset about this. Where is it? Where is it?
[804.23s -> 809.51s]  Come on. I know everyone's going to revile back when they see it on screen. They didn't nerf the
[809.51s -> 816.46s]  Moonveil. The Moonveil is still great, isn't it? They did nerf the Mimic tier and a few other things,
[816.46s -> 823.02s]  right? A few other like combos, spell combos or whatever. But Sorcery got a big buff. Almost
[823.02s -> 828.54s]  every spell got its mana reduced and some of its damage increased. So maybe we have to lean into
[828.54s -> 840.47s]  Sorcery. They nerfed, wait, the Moonveil got a stealth nerf. Really? Really? What is it? What's
[840.47s -> 846.10s]  the stealth nerf? All right, let's, let's get into this. I don't want to overwhelm myself with a
[846.10s -> 851.46s]  bunch of like bullshit. Like I just, I'm using the baby rattle. I, I, I'm almost a plus 10 baby
[851.46s -> 858.18s]  rattle, which is max. I'm here for, whoa, that was a weird. All right. I'm definitely, we're
[858.18s -> 861.14s]  going to have to get the boys up because I definitely utilize them a little more.
[862.02s -> 871.53s]  Okay. Because if the Mimic tier is not going to be a thing anymore, if this got nerfed,
[871.53s -> 876.09s]  which I put all of my shit into, and it's not that good anymore, then we're going to have,
[876.09s -> 884.82s]  we got a pivot here. We're going to have to get the boys up. The Mimic tier is still good.
[884.82s -> 904.39s]  Well, it's a different currency, so it's fine. All right. So what's new? Oh yeah. This guy over
[904.39s -> 920.87s]  here. Oh yeah. That guy died. Sombra Miner's Bell Bearing. When did I get this? Oh, I can buy
[920.87s -> 927.67s]  somber smithing stones up to four. That's a big deal. And I can buy this, uh, gloveboard as well.
[928.39s -> 933.64s]  Very cool. All right. Let's, let's just go. Let's just go. Let's go. Mimic's still good.
[934.44s -> 944.12s]  Pleased to know that Radan was nerfed. What did they do to Radan? Oh, talk to the finger reader.
[944.12s -> 953.53s]  Yeah. Why did he look like he had his head hanging out of a car window in the wind? I don't know, dude.
[954.09s -> 966.04s]  Okay.
[972.10s -> 974.10s]  The urge tree has spurned you.
[987.98s -> 989.98s]  They went into standby mode?
[998.65s -> 1006.22s]  No matter for me, but you. How will you ever manage to wait?
[1009.27s -> 1014.07s]  You know what I never understand about these grand overarching video games and stuff? It's always
[1015.40s -> 1019.48s]  the most powerful deities, the most powerful beings, the most intelligent
[1020.12s -> 1026.46s]  god sage-like beings apparently don't fucking know that there's a door in front of the urge tree.
[1027.42s -> 1034.44s]  How can you fuck that? How do you fuck that up so badly? This all-knowing entity that
[1034.44s -> 1038.68s]  converses with the greater will doesn't know that there, there is a thing in front of the urge tree.
[1039.32s -> 1044.20s]  You think that you would have known that already like 10,000 years ago.
[1049.58s -> 1053.50s]  Oh, what a turn of events. I can't believe you can't get through the front door.
[1054.22s -> 1058.70s]  Let me spend 10,000 years up here trying to figure out how to get you in the front door.
[1062.02s -> 1067.51s]  I want to burn the, oh, that's right. This didn't, she sat down, right? And she's like,
[1067.51s -> 1079.13s]  oh, I want to burn the tree or something. It's been a while. That's his magical sword.
[1079.13s -> 1093.99s]  Regal Omen Barn. That's it. Int and Faith. I... Int and Faith. B for both?
[1094.55s -> 1109.42s]  This sword is arcane and dex. I can't use it. I need an int. It's a CSGO knife. Yeah,
[1109.42s -> 1116.63s]  this is a usable item, but is it, how is it any good? I'm not getting the good scaling,
[1116.63s -> 1127.86s]  right? Because I don't have any faith. CSGO knife. I don't know. I don't think all the usable items
[1127.86s -> 1133.94s]  that are, I feel like they have some utility, but it's more of a look at this cool, okay.
[1133.94s -> 1141.78s]  This is the kind of item that you do PVP with and you just use it to be different. And people go,
[1141.78s -> 1146.02s]  whoa, wow, you're using, that's a cool thing to use. I mean, I'm going to R1 you four times
[1146.02s -> 1150.74s]  and you're dead, but that was cool what you did there. That was a nice, I know, but I haven't
[1150.74s -> 1158.01s]  seen anybody use that yet. So I, I'm just going to get the runes. This is really cool though.
[1158.49s -> 1168.17s]  This makes me want to make a like dex arcane character. I do that. Stop shitting on me.
[1168.17s -> 1174.38s]  I do it too. I'm just saying that we know what we're doing. I want to burn the impenetrable
[1174.38s -> 1195.83s]  thorn. Burn the tree. That's so fucking weird.
[1206.94s -> 1217.85s]  Would be unthinkable. This thing's just like stuck in standby mode. So why didn't you guys
[1217.85s -> 1232.50s]  figure this out before I got here? I've been walking around the whole world and not trying
[1232.50s -> 1253.11s]  to help you. I don't know who's good and who's evil in these games. Wait, we're talking,
[1253.83s -> 1262.95s]  of course, this would be a toilet flush like in the background and then the fingers start moving.
[1264.04s -> 1267.64s]  I'm back from my 10,000 years of conversion with the greater will.
[1270.90s -> 1281.88s]  Okay. How do I burn it? You're a dog barking in the background, like a zoom call.
[1282.60s -> 1303.00s]  Okay. What am I? Like there are like 30 endings in this game. Okay. I couldn't get in the front
[1303.00s -> 1310.84s]  door. Fingers are pissed about it and I'm going to burn the tree down. I guess. So we're going to
[1310.84s -> 1325.32s]  crush that thing. Interesting though. Okay. How many souls am I going to get for this? 100,000.
[1332.10s -> 1341.02s]  30. That guy was not very strong apparently. All right. Well, how's my character look?
[1341.74s -> 1349.14s]  Maybe more into mind endurance. I got 50 intelligence, 25 decks, 40 vigor.
[1350.42s -> 1364.49s]  I don't know. Endurance maybe. Maybe some more mana. I have 15 endurance omega low. Yeah. Yeah.
[1364.49s -> 1374.52s]  I mean, yeah, that's pretty bad. That's like really bad. Yeah. I mean, that's like really bad.
[1375.64s -> 1385.58s]  Okay. I am ready to move. I'm in a position where I think I'm good. I'm ready to move. All right.
[1385.58s -> 1388.54s]  That took a little longer, but I needed to kind of figure out what the hell was going on and where
[1388.54s -> 1393.34s]  I was. And when, I mean, the last time I played it was like 10 days ago, unless you're talking
[1393.34s -> 1402.31s]  about limb grave. All right. I remember here, here, there was a place to go down and there
[1402.31s -> 1406.47s]  was a big dragon hand. And I remember saying to you guys, I want to do that when I come back.
[1407.27s -> 1422.30s]  Here we are. All right. Let me head down here. I think this is where I need to be. No. Where is it?
[1425.05s -> 1434.70s]  I got to get this stuff burnt back into memory of like where I am. Is it not this one? Oh,
[1434.70s -> 1440.58s]  this is right. Is it right? I thought it was. Oh my God. I thought that was a fucking enemy.
[1440.58s -> 1447.43s]  I was like, why does I have to fight that thing? Uh, I think I'm gonna go down and see.
[1448.07s -> 1452.23s]  It's really hard to navigate the Capitol. Um, I thought I kind of knew what I was doing,
[1453.03s -> 1468.39s]  but it's just been a while. I'll check down here. Oh shit. Wait. Okay. Hold on. I see an item over
[1468.39s -> 1476.01s]  there. Okay. I got, I got wicked bad glare on my screen right now. It's fucking me up.
[1487.03s -> 1510.95s]  These guys suck. This is the best item. Everyone that we were talking a lot of shit about the
[1510.95s -> 1515.99s]  baby rattle, but it's very good. Are the awards on the shelf? They are not. I actually,
[1518.52s -> 1524.57s]  actually forgot them, but it's okay. You know, the Jake is on the case. I'm going to get them.
[1524.89s -> 1539.27s]  I know I, they, I had them and had them and then two or three cocktails later. I didn't.
[1545.50s -> 1551.27s]  Oh, that's right. I climbed up this shit. All right. Easy, easy, easy. So if I go,
[1551.27s -> 1557.91s]  can I go down from here? And is this the right way? I don't think so. What about the other side?
[1558.47s -> 1570.22s]  Is this where I wanted to go? This is, it has to be right. I think that's where I needed to go.
[1571.02s -> 1574.46s]  Yeah. Cause there was a big arm on the ground and it was like cool looking. Okay. Let's go.
[1575.10s -> 1597.10s]  I got this fucking glare on the screen. Is he supposed to be hiding? What the fuck? Should I
[1597.10s -> 1601.53s]  go down here? All right. I'm going down here. We're fighting this thing. I got this,
[1601.53s -> 1607.18s]  I got this glare that I got to take care of. Give me one second. It's a, it's a goal. This
[1607.18s -> 1633.24s]  room is glaring. I think that's, that's better. Yeah. Uh, there we go. Address losing the awards.
[1633.24s -> 1639.16s]  I didn't lose them. They just were put in a box and then I left the box and I forgot to take
[1639.16s -> 1644.20s]  the box. So we're good. We're good. Community Jake is on the case and he has confirmed that
[1644.84s -> 1653.03s]  I got him. We're good. We're good. We're fine. All right. Um, let's go. I fuck it. I'm going down.
[1653.75s -> 1662.20s]  Wait, you don't come down. Oh, that's not what I would. That's not what I anticipated.
[1662.76s -> 1680.82s]  We're fine. Fine. You do melt them down. I wouldn't want to melt them down. They're
[1680.82s -> 1685.83s]  not made out of a material that would be safe to do that. I feel like I wouldn't want to breathe
[1685.83s -> 1691.11s]  the air in the room that I did that in. All right. Where's he at? Can he fire up here?
[1691.75s -> 1717.80s]  He can fire up here. All right. Whatever. Stop. Oh, they made comet better. I don't know why it
[1717.80s -> 1731.48s]  sounded like that. It sounded like a weird like talk show host, like a radio host. Why am I doing
[1731.48s -> 1740.15s]  it like this by the way? Just go down there and fucking attack him. Go. I don't even man up.
[1740.15s -> 1750.23s]  All right. That was so simple. I don't know why I made that way too complicated.
[1755.61s -> 1760.30s]  All right. So there's nothing down here. Maybe that block. He's blocking the path.
[1761.02s -> 1766.68s]  I don't know. Intriguing. Are you going to use the guide for the remaining quests?
[1767.78s -> 1776.22s]  No, I don't think so. Look, this game, this game is so unbelievably ridiculous that playing through
[1776.22s -> 1782.31s]  the game again, look, I have like four characters that are ready to get out of limb grip. Um, so
[1783.19s -> 1788.42s]  playing the game another two or three times and experiencing more stuff, I kind of want to leave
[1788.42s -> 1796.06s]  it. I kind of want to leave it. I'd like to experience more stuff with other characters.
[1799.30s -> 1808.10s]  Okay. So that's, I can't go there, but let's try over here. So people that are saying, oh dude,
[1808.10s -> 1811.46s]  you're going to go back and do like every single secret boss and secret thing and you're going to
[1811.46s -> 1820.78s]  go clear out. Probably not. No, I don't think so. I think that's fun to be able to experience it.
[1821.58s -> 1824.90s]  Um, again, with another character and just do different stuff that I didn't do.
[1825.70s -> 1850.30s]  That's good. He hates Elden ring. I can go up here. I, there are noises coming from over here.
[1850.86s -> 1877.18s]  I get to, wait, was I was already down here, wasn't I? Wasn't I already down here? There's
[1877.18s -> 1891.40s]  like a, one of those killers, the Omen killer people were here. Are you going to do a retch
[1891.40s -> 1897.85s]  playthrough? Uh, I don't know. Retch playthroughs are awesome, but you end up like hating the game
[1897.85s -> 1902.65s]  in the first hour or two. And every time I've ever tried to do retch or whatever they call it
[1902.65s -> 1907.13s]  in the other games, I go, oh, this is awesome. And I get started base level 10 with everything.
[1907.13s -> 1912.01s]  That's perfect. And then I get, I start playing the game and I get killed in like two hits by
[1912.01s -> 1916.81s]  something or I can't hurt something. And I go, this is stupid. Why did I ever do this? Like,
[1916.81s -> 1919.85s]  what a dumb thing to do. Just pick one of the normal characters and I like flip out.
[1920.73s -> 1941.26s]  I didn't go down here. Isn't me strong a retch? Yeah, but that was only because I had to do me
[1941.26s -> 1948.49s]  strong as a retch because they start with the club. That's a different scenario. All right,
[1948.49s -> 1961.69s]  let's go this way. Retch is enjoyable in this game. Is it? I don't think so. Fuck you.
[1962.81s -> 1975.66s]  Poison bone dot. How come you don't know how to put a suit on? I know how to put. All right. First
[1975.66s -> 1985.78s]  of all, I, okay. I know how to put it. I don't know. I know how to put a suit on. I just don't
[1985.78s -> 1995.59s]  wear them that often and hate these enemies. I have not had a reason to put a suit on in a long
[1995.59s -> 2036.57s]  time. Don't you understand? What? Why did that happen? No, no. Oh my God. I fucking,
[2036.57s -> 2051.16s]  I actually hate this enemy. I'm out of fucking juice. Riding the guys in this hallway is so bad,
[2051.16s -> 2059.66s]  by the way. You can't go anywhere. And I need my lantern or like starlight or something. I can't,
[2059.66s -> 2075.51s]  I can't see anything. Yeah. I don't know. You, you hold on. Skin's coming out of my mouth.
[2077.69s -> 2092.87s]  I still haven't done anything with those either. No. Okay. Did I get the lantern? I feel like I
[2092.87s -> 2097.74s]  didn't buy it. And every time I don't buy it, you guys remind me to buy it. And I go,
[2097.74s -> 2101.90s]  nah, it's all right, dude. I got fucking starlight and, and then I don't put it on.
[2101.90s -> 2110.38s]  And I'm just walking around in darkness. What's your favorite lunchable? The original,
[2110.94s -> 2116.94s]  I believe was ham, cheese and crackers. That's it. None of this. I don't, there's all this new
[2116.94s -> 2126.92s]  bullshit. Oh, like pizza in like a fucking tube or whatever the hell it is. No, excuse me. Ham,
[2126.92s -> 2131.32s]  cheese or turkey and cheese. The little circles, nothing else. Please don't give me any of that.
[2131.32s -> 2148.55s]  Oh, like tacos. What the fuck are you talking about? That's zoomer food. I mean, it's food
[2148.55s -> 2158.09s]  for kids. I don't know if it's necessarily zoomer food. Zoomer food. I mean, I ate that when I was
[2158.09s -> 2183.85s]  young and I'm not a zoomer. All right. I gotta get back there. What the fuck? Oh, I am so strong.
[2185.66s -> 2188.46s]  Although I'm probably going to, that confidence is probably going to disappear very soon.
[2195.53s -> 2198.57s]  Oh, this is where he was. All right. So what, is there anything else down here?
[2201.22s -> 2212.74s]  What else is down here? You're outleveled for this area. Yeah. But I did a lot of
[2212.74s -> 2221.99s]  exploring early in the game. That's fine though. I don't care. Level 98, 99. All right. How do I
[2221.99s -> 2241.48s]  get that? How do I get that item? Oh shit. Okay. So I don't think I can do anything else down here.
[2241.48s -> 2248.52s]  I'm just going to go up unless, did I build this? Yeah, I did. No, I didn't. Okay.
[2251.80s -> 2259.88s]  My thoughts on the game so far? It's, I, I don't need, I don't really don't even know what to say
[2259.88s -> 2264.82s]  anymore. It's not like nothing compares. Have you guys found it like funny? Okay. You know,
[2264.82s -> 2268.74s]  isn't there like still like 400 plus thousand concurrent players playing this game right now?
[2271.29s -> 2277.45s]  I think like everybody's just been sort of waiting for a game like this for like a fucking decade.
[2279.19s -> 2283.83s]  Even Dark Souls three, right? Was like good. It was cool. That was fucking fun, but
[2284.55s -> 2291.11s]  Sekiro was good. It was fun. It was challenging. It was hard. I mean, I, I don't know. I feel like
[2291.11s -> 2301.72s]  I haven't played a game like this in a decade. Guilty hood? First hood to cloak of olive brown.
[2302.36s -> 2317.78s]  It doesn't really do anything. What does it look like? That's cool. I mean, I need, I want the,
[2318.58s -> 2328.09s]  what's the intelligence, right? Uh, I mean, the, the issue I think is that so many people have
[2328.09s -> 2333.53s]  been waiting for, I think what a lot of people can say, let me, let me say, I think, let me say,
[2333.53s -> 2340.90s]  I think like 10 times more times in a row. So open world games have become sort of a form you,
[2340.90s -> 2351.94s]  form your Lamatic thing, right? I think this made the open world concept a lot cooler because
[2352.50s -> 2357.14s]  it's sort of, it's not the way that normal open world games play. You kind of just have to go
[2357.14s -> 2362.73s]  explore. You have to go figure it out on your own. And something about that is, is so overwhelming,
[2362.73s -> 2369.14s]  but so welcoming at the same time, because nobody is telling me where I have to go. And it's like
[2369.46s -> 2373.94s]  terrifying because you'll accidentally walk into some places you might not, maybe it shouldn't be.
[2375.06s -> 2381.86s]  And it's this horrifying, but equally like interesting experience where you kind of did
[2381.86s -> 2391.16s]  that to yourself. Even if you, it's not that different. Sorry. Sorry. I thought you, I thought
[2391.16s -> 2400.09s]  you, I thought that we were on Reddit. I thought you replied to me on Reddit. I'm all right. I'm
[2400.09s -> 2412.60s]  okay. I did this. I remember this Reddit brain, but it, it, okay. It's not that different,
[2413.32s -> 2418.28s]  but everything feels like it's in its place. Okay. Everything feels like it was hand placed,
[2419.00s -> 2425.10s]  like everything does from the starter area to the later areas, to walking around, everything feels
[2425.10s -> 2433.70s]  hand placed, handmade, like this was crafted in a fucking clay and everyone's saying breath of the
[2433.70s -> 2437.70s]  wild. I haven't played breath of the wild yet. So let me experience that and I'll give you my,
[2437.70s -> 2443.29s]  no, because then people are going to be pissed. All right. That was not, did I fucking miss
[2443.29s -> 2457.88s]  anything down here? I think I cleared it. Play it, play it, play it. But what if I play breath of
[2457.88s -> 2464.12s]  the wild and I stream it and I'm sitting there as Mr. Streamer mode, trying to desperately say,
[2466.04s -> 2480.36s]  fuck, I don't like this. And then I'm going to have to be like, it's okay. It's pretty good.
[2480.36s -> 2485.37s]  I like it. And then they're going to go, he's lying. He hates it. And then I'm going to like,
[2485.37s -> 2493.32s]  stop playing it in two days and I'm going to lose 50,000 fucking do it. That's what I'm scared of.
[2496.89s -> 2508.30s]  Um, I probably would actually really like it. What's this? Do I have this? Oh shit. Is this
[2508.30s -> 2519.27s]  down or up? Do I have this? Oh fuck. It's just literally this. It's just, I could have climbed
[2519.27s -> 2525.34s]  up there with my fingernails. Why do you think you'll hate it so much? I know I don't think,
[2525.34s -> 2535.43s]  I really don't think I will. I think I would probably love it a lot. All right. Um, I need
[2535.43s -> 2541.83s]  to get to that area with the arm. I gotta go. It's been so, it's been too long. I gotta,
[2541.83s -> 2548.86s]  I don't remember. I gotta go like that. Where's the dragon? Dragon has like an arm on the ground,
[2549.50s -> 2558.22s]  but it has to be this way. It has to be up in that area over there by the boss, right? This
[2558.22s -> 2572.28s]  dragon has an arm that's on the ground. I don't know where it is. Let me go over here. Let me go
[2572.28s -> 2577.40s]  backwards from here. It's just like, I can't remember. Where are you trying to go? I'm trying,
[2577.40s -> 2582.36s]  there was a place like kind of down the bottom where the dra- like a big long dragon arm is on
[2582.36s -> 2588.78s]  the ground. And I remember looking down there and thinking it was important. I feel like it's out
[2588.78s -> 2601.98s]  here. Like this way, maybe? What'd you find? Top, top, top, what? Okay. I remember running,
[2601.98s -> 2613.21s]  yep. I ran by this. Go down the well. There's a site of grace near the main road. You need to
[2613.21s -> 2621.45s]  go down the well. Okay. Hold on. Let me, let me go backwards from here. Cause I, you know,
[2621.45s -> 2625.05s]  the reason why I didn't put this into memory at all is because I actually just sprinted
[2625.05s -> 2630.09s]  through this whole area to fight the two bosses. I like deliriously tired. So I think I just need
[2630.09s -> 2638.18s]  to go backwards and just play from here. There's a well under the dragon. Oh shit. All right.
[2638.18s -> 2656.47s]  How'd I get that? Sons out, guns out. That's right. Okay. I fought Godfrey in this room.
[2656.47s -> 2666.78s]  I remember that. And this went around here. Let me go down this way. Cause all these dead
[2667.34s -> 2676.47s]  um, finger ladies, don't listen to them about the well they're trolling you. I mean, I, I, I,
[2677.19s -> 2687.02s]  I'll find it. Holy grease. Okay. Times six. Jesus. Okay. Now from here, how do I go down from here?
[2687.58s -> 2703.78s]  This is smoke. Grace in here. What's out here? Ah, this is where the roots go. And this is how
[2703.78s -> 2713.59s]  I went up the first time. Yeah. Okay. I remember this. That led all the way up there. So let me
[2713.59s -> 2719.38s]  rock down here. Did I play the demon souls remake? No. Cause getting a PlayStation five
[2720.42s -> 2727.46s]  is impossible. So no, I, I unfortunately have not played it. I have, I have absolutely no idea how
[2727.46s -> 2739.32s]  good it is. I'd love to maybe experience it one day. All right. I think I'm close. I just don't
[2739.32s -> 2751.11s]  want to miss anything. Super important, right? I get up there. Oh my God. What have I done?
[2752.07s -> 2772.07s]  What happened? What? They, who killed him? Oh, this move is so good. This move is so good.
[2772.07s -> 2779.19s]  This baby rattle is fucking unbelievable. It really is. I got the damage on it, the scaling.
[2781.82s -> 2791.91s]  Oh, I, oh, wait, have I been here? Didn't I, did I kill that? I didn't. All right. So this is new.
[2792.55s -> 2795.91s]  This is new. This is new info. All right. I got new info. I haven't been here yet.
[2796.55s -> 2809.43s]  Let me fight this. Please show. No. Oh, the seeds over there. All right. Nice. This is why I didn't
[2809.43s -> 2823.93s]  want to just run. I didn't want to just disappear from here. Is it aggro everybody? I had to get
[2823.93s -> 2867.03s]  rid of these guys quick. Get out of here. Jump your fucking party horns up. Jesus Christ. Stupid
[2867.03s -> 2920.23s]  idiot. Is he healing? Why do I feel like he's healing? I hit him with a 1500. Gargoyles halberd,
[2929.27s -> 2938.86s]  C and E scaling. Oh, bronze halberd wielded by valiant gargoyle. Just like the wielder,
[2938.86s -> 2943.42s]  the missing parts have been mended with the corp, with corpse wax, a patchwork of champions.
[2945.93s -> 2950.09s]  Spin. Is that that? I don't think that's, is that unique? I don't think that's a unique move.
[2950.09s -> 2966.94s]  This is the guy that growled at Chad and turned purple. Yes, it is. I fucking can't believe that's
[2966.94s -> 2973.43s]  got to be one of the, I don't even know what to say about that. All right. I definitely have not
[2973.43s -> 2977.27s]  been here, so we're just going to keep going whatever way we're going here. There it is. There
[2977.27s -> 2982.22s]  it is right there, right? Is that what I was looking for? That's definitely, yep, that's
[2982.22s -> 2987.72s]  definitely what I was looking for. I don't even know what category you put that in, but that was
[2987.72s -> 2991.72s]  the worst of something. That was the worst something. I don't know why, but it was bad.
[2991.72s -> 3003.94s]  It was very bad. Do you ever need another move? I don't think so. This, this thing almost got
[3003.94s -> 3014.25s]  voted off the island too. Yep. This is absolutely where I want to be. This is exactly what I was
[3014.25s -> 3033.45s]  looking for. Does that need to go down there? There's the hand. All right. Yeah. I didn't go
[3033.45s -> 3049.94s]  over there though. That was survivor reference. Where'd he go? Nine golden rune. Pretty sick.
[3051.30s -> 3055.70s]  So do we, do we celebrate getting to level 100? Cause that's going to happen in probably like
[3055.70s -> 3062.47s]  10 to 20 minutes. I kicked that guy's ass by the way. Like that, I fired, I kicked that, that
[3062.47s -> 3067.59s]  garbill's ass. Can we be, you see like those perfect dodges? Let me jump over his sword and
[3067.59s -> 3073.96s]  shit. I don't, I don't, I don't think I saw an appraise for that one. I looked over and I
[3073.96s -> 3080.78s]  saw like a couple of pogs, but like I didn't see like a wave of them. I thought that was quite
[3080.78s -> 3089.85s]  impressive. All right. Yeah. I remember, no, I sprinted through here too. It's such a fucking
[3089.85s -> 3096.50s]  blur. This is the round table hold, right? And I sprinted through here and I was like, wow,
[3096.50s -> 3100.66s]  what is this? This is a round table. And you guys are like, go to bed, go to bed. And I was like,
[3100.66s -> 3105.27s]  no, I don't need to go to bed. I'm just going to keep running. I, I, yeah, this is round table
[3105.27s -> 3112.57s]  hold. This is the round table hold. So let me explore this a little bit more than just
[3112.57s -> 3120.73s]  running through it and picking up random items by my sword. Are we like all dead or something?
[3121.29s -> 3129.98s]  Cause this is where the lady sits. Are we dead? Like, and this is, we've been dead in the real
[3129.98s -> 3139.96s]  world or something. Cause this is the round table hold and there's a bunch of dead people here.
[3140.68s -> 3159.06s]  Nobody's alive in here. Yeah. Fucking what the heck we're going to find our body.
[3161.18s -> 3165.82s]  Aren't we? Our body is going to be lying on the fucking ground and the music is going to
[3165.82s -> 3171.56s]  kick up. The violin is going to kick in hard and it's going to be a fucking item on me.
[3175.74s -> 3190.76s]  It's going to be a single rune fragment. So what the hell, what's okay. So what is actually
[3190.76s -> 3199.38s]  going on here? Why this has got like kind of Hunter's dream vibes to it. Is that the guy?
[3199.94s -> 3211.98s]  It's a different area. But yeah, but how we're going to find that guy and he's going to be like,
[3212.22s -> 3244.18s]  charnished seems you found the truth. See seed bed curse. I need one more of those.
[3244.90s -> 3257.45s]  First grown on a body defiled by the dung eater, tenderpox afflicted with omen horns.
[3258.17s -> 3263.85s]  The dung eater cultivates the seed bed curse on corpses. By doing so, he prevents dead souls
[3263.85s -> 3270.17s]  returning to the herd tree, leaving them forever cursed. One of the most loathsome things found in
[3270.17s -> 3304.12s]  all of the lands between. I know, I know where that is. Oh no, damn it. Come on.
[3308.22s -> 3315.42s]  All right. So I've, I'm very curious about something, but I don't want to teleport yet,
[3315.42s -> 3323.66s]  but I, let me just look through this fully completely. Yeah. Where's the, uh, where's
[3323.66s -> 3343.90s]  the Smith usually anything else here? No, not in here. Okay. He's so high. I'm not, I'm fine.
[3348.97s -> 3354.17s]  Wait, I don't want to miss anything. I know I'm walking around and sit. Okay. This is where the
[3354.17s -> 3376.33s]  Smith usually is. Hmm. This is not usually open. Okay. All right. All right. Outside. What about
[3376.33s -> 3384.39s]  the finger lady room? Yeah. I don't want to, you know, there's no, there's no rushing through Elden
[3384.39s -> 3393.91s]  ring. This is like the best game to come out in the last 60 fucking years. Okay. You understand
[3393.91s -> 3398.71s]  how sad you're going to be if you rush through this and then like 20 years from now, you're
[3398.71s -> 3407.56s]  going to be like, God, I wish I, I wish I'd slowed down. I wish I had slowed down and, you know,
[3408.44s -> 3417.96s]  enjoyed life more and paid more attention to the Southern side of Limgrave. I feel like I
[3417.96s -> 3424.30s]  didn't explore it completely. Chat was really odd. My case about hurrying through the game.
[3425.02s -> 3440.42s]  Oh, grandpa, it's okay. No, it's not. This is closed. It's not what's in here. All right. That's
[3440.42s -> 3454.14s]  what, all right. That's where the, that's where the fingers are. Let me guess. Coded sword. What is
[3454.14s -> 3464.50s]  that? And how badly do I want to look at it? Hey, fuck. Okay. What? Oh my God. This is cool.
[3468.58s -> 3477.67s]  It only, it starts at B faith scaling, by the way, nothing else in sword. Once granted to the
[3477.67s -> 3484.86s]  tarnished of the round table by the two fingers, a formless cipher comprises its blade, which does
[3484.86s -> 3491.67s]  holy damage. No shield can repel. Champions would gather at the round table hold and days long past
[3491.67s -> 3498.30s]  when the two fingers were masters of operation, their flesh yet full of vigor. And it has the
[3498.30s -> 3519.78s]  unblockable blade spell. Holy shit. Thanks for the bug wing from software. Why is a faith gets all
[3519.78s -> 3550.04s]  the faith gets all the cool shit. Okay. Like really? That's so fucking awesome. Bro. It literally
[3550.04s -> 3553.96s]  gets everything in this game. Not the cool stuff. It gets everything except the cool things.
[3554.92s -> 3568.25s]  Look at how cool that is. That's cooler than the bug wing. I know what that's like such like a straw
[3568.25s -> 3574.10s]  man, right? Like, oh yeah. Like we get the bug wing. It's like, you also get the baby rattle.
[3574.10s -> 3579.38s]  I guarantee you there's people that have like 50 points in faith that saw this item and they went
[3579.38s -> 3587.61s]  fucking God damn it. Faith sucks. You mean to tell me I could have a solar system flail
[3588.17s -> 3593.61s]  that does a crazy magic damage and these end fucking pieces of shit get the best stuff in
[3593.61s -> 3603.11s]  the game. All right. So I think I got everything. That's cool. That's an amazing item. I want to,
[3603.11s -> 3607.86s]  I don't want to go that way because I'm scared to go that way. I want to go out where the
[3607.86s -> 3615.80s]  arm was. What is the scale with this scales with int at decks and at strength, but not really.
[3615.80s -> 3621.11s]  All right, let's go. That was cool. This is cool. All right. Now that I spent the first
[3621.11s -> 3625.35s]  hour walking around in a circle and just talking, uh, if we can actually do some progress here,
[3625.35s -> 3629.85s]  which I count that fucking gargoyle. This progress. All right, let me get out of here.
[3630.65s -> 3641.40s]  Zero on fire here somewhere. I feel like they probably is. I have to go back and I want to
[3641.40s -> 3650.22s]  talk to that guy down the hall. I always, I always get like stuck in the round table hold already.
[3650.22s -> 3658.12s]  All right. You know, I'm just jumping over the balcony. I came in here. I remember this,
[3658.12s -> 3671.06s]  but did I explore in here? I don't think so. Not fully up yawning. There is. All right. Thank
[3671.06s -> 3686.52s]  goodness. What? I didn't, I already had it. Think not. I shall see to that. I ask of you
[3687.16s -> 3693.96s]  is to make the journey to the snowy mountain tops of the giants far above the clouds.
[3693.96s -> 3701.64s]  So you can burn the urge for you to commit a cardinal sin, but it must be done to reach the
[3701.64s -> 3709.40s]  path. Do I have to do that though? Is the path I wish to travel. Well, uh, you, you wish to travel
[3709.40s -> 3717.61s]  that way, but what if I wish to travel a different way? I think we might be at ends here because like,
[3717.61s -> 3723.91s]  Oh, this is what I want. This is what I, what about, and what about what I want? How about this?
[3724.73s -> 3731.82s]  All right. I'll burn the Erd tree, but I want you to give me 50 faith right now, right now.
[3731.82s -> 3747.75s]  Give it to me. We both get what we want. Maidenless. I'm not maidenless. Look. Okay.
[3747.75s -> 3753.50s]  So now I know where I need to go. So let's do this. This is, what's this bonfire called?
[3754.14s -> 3761.61s]  The round table hold two or something, fortified manner, first floor. Okay. Let's go see what's
[3761.61s -> 3787.86s]  going on here because I have a feeling he's by the usk people, which is okay. This is where that was.
[3787.86s -> 3788.98s]  So let's see what he has to say.
[3810.73s -> 3819.26s]  All your flesh trapped in the sewer jail below the Capitol and kill you
[3819.98s -> 3832.71s]  and defile your corpse. Then the pox will truly be your own. What is the key?
[3837.13s -> 3843.26s]  What if he, what if he kills me? I have to be careful because what if he kills me? Do I,
[3843.26s -> 3849.75s]  do I like, does it fuck a bunch of stuff up? Unlock sewer jail door said to lie beneath
[3849.75s -> 3863.83s]  Lindell, the Royal Capitol. So that's down in the sewer. Okay. Oh, okay. This guy's at.
[3864.63s -> 3867.38s]  There's a well under the dragon's wing.
[3871.22s -> 3871.78s]  I'm going to kick his ass.
[3877.05s -> 3881.82s]  Yeah, we'll see. Oh, you talk a lot of shit from behind that fucking computer screen. Don't you?
[3882.71s -> 3887.98s]  Mm hmm. Sure. Oh, you talk a lot of shit. I'm about to see you in fucking real life.
[3901.67s -> 3917.48s]  This guy's a literal shit eater. Oh, this is the, uh, desperate Roger.
[3920.54s -> 3925.54s]  Yeah. He's a, he's a very close friend.
[3937.22s -> 3938.02s]  He's a very close friend.
[3942.89s -> 3943.85s]  This is like one of my best friends.
[3943.85s -> 3972.92s]  I went to his wedding. I was in his wedding. So, hey, okay. Fuck. You got anything else to say?
[3983.30s -> 3992.74s]  No, I was in the wedding party. I look blown out right now. I think the light's too bright.
[3996.66s -> 4019.50s]  What the fuck is going on with this guy? Is this two people? That's his right arm
[4019.50s -> 4031.40s]  and his left arm is there. That's another person's arm. Oh, wait, it's, wait, is this one of those
[4031.40s -> 4035.56s]  costumes that you can get at the party store where it's like, oh, look, I'm riding on a dinosaur.
[4035.56s -> 4043.27s]  And it's like, my legs are the, are the dinosaur's legs. And like, I'm, I'm like inflatable legs are
[4043.27s -> 4052.62s]  riding the horse or whatever. Are you sure? This looks like it's two people. Wait, why,
[4052.62s -> 4059.82s]  why is it going like this? If this was just armor, why, why are you going like this? Why are you
[4059.82s -> 4068.31s]  covering the face of the armor? That's his right arm is holding that. That's somebody else going
[4068.31s -> 4080.89s]  like this. No, you guys got it all wrong. This is two people. This is actually two people.
[4081.53s -> 4100.60s]  Does he have four arms? That's arm one. His, that shoulder is arm. Oh, wait, is that shoulder fake?
[4103.50s -> 4111.99s]  Is the armor like posed like this? So then why is he holding underneath? No, you guys got,
[4111.99s -> 4116.95s]  this is two people. I can't, I can't wait till this guy stands up and like, in like another 12 hours
[4116.95s -> 4123.27s]  and he has like four fucking blades, like general grievous style. And the other, the other head
[4123.27s -> 4134.82s]  starts talking. Thank you. All right. So let me, I guess go to the sewer. That's interesting. Let's
[4134.82s -> 4156.12s]  do that right now. So underneath the sewer and he's in a cell. Apparently this is under the dragon's
[4156.12s -> 4173.83s]  wing. I'm not done exploring yet. Hold on. See exactly. This is why you can't just, this is,
[4173.83s -> 4177.19s]  I'm telling you, this is once in a generation. Am I going to get to walk up those stairs
[4177.19s -> 4206.84s]  and get that item for the first time? Those NPCs are friendly and you triple jump. You cannot,
[4206.84s -> 4219.16s]  you can double jump on the horse. I don't know how to get it. Oh, what is it? It's just, it's
[4219.16s -> 4226.71s]  all right. It's, it's not purple or legendary. Those guys had dialogue. We didn't hear it.
[4229.19s -> 4239.29s]  All right. I'm going to say the area that I wanted to go was this way, right? That way. Yes.
[4240.25s -> 4249.43s]  Progress. It's fucking cool, man. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. Finally.
[4249.43s -> 4269.37s]  I found it. I found it. It's pretty fucking cool. I have to do better than that. Lightning is like
[4269.37s -> 4278.42s]  one. You don't do it when he puts it up. It's a second after it's like, boom, dodge, boom, dodge.
[4278.42s -> 4300.07s]  I have, that was 50,000 souls. I don't want to lose those. And let's also be able to be a magician
[4300.07s -> 4304.55s]  here. It's the guy that beat dark souls three on stream. I actually replaced that with secure
[4304.55s -> 4312.20s]  because less people did that, right? We have to like move it up. So less people beat the last
[4312.20s -> 4315.40s]  boss in secure. Oh, then beat the last boss in dark souls three. We're going to use that from now
[4315.40s -> 4333.91s]  on. You know what? Yep. First, that's going to take a lot longer. You don't come over here.
[4346.92s -> 4354.68s]  Oh, that hurts a lot. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Don't do lightning. Don't
[4354.68s -> 4374.63s]  do that. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Damn it. Stop fucking shooting me with a bow and
[4374.63s -> 4385.83s]  arrow for a second. These guys don't get any hit recovery Diablo two reference, but you know what
[4385.83s -> 4444.63s]  I mean? They're like, what was that? Okay. Jeez. Ooh, that was so loud. And I'm so glad that my
[4444.63s -> 4455.10s]  eye have a noise gate because holy shit. All right, dude, you know what? I've got, I've got
[4455.82s -> 4467.45s]  some items. This is ridiculous. Okay. I need to craft some items. I'm going to make some of these,
[4467.45s -> 4482.38s]  I think. All right. Some of these scale anything scale with intelligence doesn't look like it
[4482.38s -> 4494.65s]  arcane. All right. I'm just going to make, I can make 11 of these. I'm just going to make
[4494.65s -> 4505.78s]  11 fire things. Um, I don't, I guess I'm going to make, um, some of these sure. I'm going to make
[4505.78s -> 4514.10s]  this impede healing actually kind of cool. That's kind of cool. I think for invasions,
[4516.82s -> 4526.10s]  I heard it. I didn't hear anything. Fire bombs alleviates blood loss. Okay. I'm going to make
[4526.10s -> 4530.98s]  some of these alleviates frost. Look, just make shit. What's the point of keeping it forever?
[4532.04s -> 4537.05s]  Just make stuff. It's the first time I've been this long in the crafting menu and almost a
[4537.05s -> 4558.87s]  hundred hours in the game. Okay. All right. I think I've made some stuff. Okay. So now let's
[4559.43s -> 4577.02s]  over here. Now the items here. So creepy. This is it right here. Yep. It's going to be right here.
[4577.82s -> 4587.90s]  How would you build that? All right. What's going on? Apples stone.
[4588.54s -> 4611.94s]  This is not it. Oh, wait. It's not it, man. It's not it. Fam. I feel like I can get up there,
[4611.94s -> 4640.15s]  but wait, I make that good. Very good. So this is not it. Is this not as under? So it's under the
[4640.15s -> 4646.23s]  other wing. I did want to come check this out though. Anything else I can do? I could go up
[4646.23s -> 4666.20s]  there next game. No, I'm an Elden ring streamer. I've solidified my place as Elden ring content
[4666.20s -> 4675.05s]  creator. Yeah. I'm not a smite streamer anymore. I'm an Elden ring streamer. All right. Well,
[4675.05s -> 4694.50s]  this is not it, but I kind of feel like I can get up here. Maybe. What about over here? No,
[4694.50s -> 4700.87s]  it doesn't look like it. All right. Well, I'll go the other way. What about Mario golf? Yeah,
[4700.87s -> 4708.46s]  I did play Mario golf for about two or three hours. It was fine. It was fine. It was fine.
[4709.02s -> 4716.31s]  Okay. Those of you that want to get like a big hot take from Mr. German to tell us about how much he
[4716.31s -> 4721.27s]  gave Mario golf for seven. It was fine. It was fun. It was interesting. The game was fun.
[4722.15s -> 4730.38s]  I haven't watched you in 10 years. Who is the TF2 content? Um, there's 10 years worth of it
[4732.25s -> 4739.74s]  on video on demand right now. Did you guys understand that like you have the amount of
[4739.74s -> 4745.58s]  content for every season of Seinfeld and every season of friends and every season of game of
[4745.58s -> 4752.62s]  Thrones as team fortress to video content. Just go, go to the, go to the, my Netflix fucking page,
[4752.62s -> 4759.27s]  whatever. Go to my YouTube page. It's like, there's like, there's like 700 days of TF2 videos.
[4761.29s -> 4776.10s]  Probably way less than that, but you, you, you understand. Okay. So let me go over this way now.
[4776.10s -> 4781.62s]  Not net. No, I'm not, uh, don't get me in trouble. I just said like, it was like a Netflix esque
[4781.62s -> 4785.22s]  platform of YouTube content, video on demand. All right. I'm going that way.
[4786.10s -> 4808.76s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going this way. This is new. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah. Oh shit. That's two.
[4809.64s -> 4862.58s]  Fuck your timings. Fucking what? Where can you even fall there? That's, I don't even understand
[4862.58s -> 4870.95s]  where you fall there. Oh, God damn it. Am I seriously here? Whatever. Well, you just, yeah,
[4872.89s -> 4881.22s]  I don't get it. I need to look at that. Is the baseball stream definitely happening in March?
[4881.22s -> 4895.22s]  No, the baseball stream I can tell you right now is 100% confirmed to be the next stream that is
[4895.78s -> 4907.24s]  like an event stream, which I mean, I really wanted it to be in March, but it's a lot of moving parts
[4907.96s -> 4914.68s]  and trying to get all those moving parts to work. It's a lot of people to have to get together,
[4915.32s -> 4922.10s]  but I will stop at nothing. That's for him to happen over the next few months.
[4922.82s -> 4933.75s]  Okay, let's get this guy. So when did I fall down? I didn't even know this. Okay. I like knew this.
[4933.75s -> 4939.88s]  I thought there was a railing. Where did I even fall? I thought, okay, that was weird. I thought
[4939.88s -> 4959.53s]  this was like a railing. I almost did it again. Oh, dude. Fucking dungeon down here. Oh, yeah,
[4959.53s -> 4977.14s]  this is fucking dungeon down here. Am I, is this safe? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. This is
[4977.14s -> 4998.25s]  definitely something down here. Wish I could get on the horse. I saw an item and I freaked out and
[4998.25s -> 5020.60s]  I was like, I need to go get it. All right. So where does this go? Nice. I actually really need
[5020.60s -> 5035.02s]  these. Oh shit. What's over there? I need to, I want to just keep that marked because this like
[5035.02s -> 5043.43s]  somebody lying down over there is an invisible bridge. If this is a lie, I'm turning my stream
[5043.43s -> 5062.82s]  off. Do I? Infirm it. Otherwise it's going off. All right. Well, I can't go that way. That was
[5062.82s -> 5071.58s]  cool. I just like this. All right, let's go back up. I want to go into this Coliseum. There are no
[5071.58s -> 5075.50s]  invisible bridges. From Software did it once and everybody thought it was the worst thing they've
[5075.50s -> 5085.82s]  ever made. So they were like, we should probably not do that again. Actually, no, this is the
[5085.82s -> 5098.58s]  right way. I remember playing that area in Dark Souls 3. It was in Dark Souls 2. I remember. It's
[5098.58s -> 5103.69s]  like the weird crystal area. And I did say out loud, this is the worst thing that they've ever
[5103.69s -> 5111.29s]  made. Didn't I? I say that all the time though. Does that not hold any more weight at all? Because
[5111.29s -> 5121.51s]  I keep saying that it just holds no weight. This is the worst thing I think that they've made.
[5122.31s -> 5128.39s]  All right. Well, you've said that like 15 times. Do you even like this game? Do you even like these
[5128.39s -> 5132.76s]  fucking games? This is probably the worst fucking area they've ever made. This is the worst boss.
[5132.76s -> 5138.68s]  I think they've ever made. Jeremy, there are only two other areas that are in the game.
[5139.78s -> 5149.90s]  Yeah, whatever. Talking in third person. He's a fucking ego weirdo. All right, pay attention.
[5149.90s -> 5188.74s]  Eat shit. So good when you get it. That was a little cocky allegory. Oh, what do you got?
[5191.59s -> 5204.41s]  Duelist helm. A duelist helm. What is that? Bronze helm decorated with innumerable snakes
[5205.29s -> 5209.85s]  worn by gladiators who were driven from the Coliseum. The wearer becomes a slightly easier
[5209.85s -> 5220.14s]  target for foes. What? You have a bigger hitbox with this on? The snake is viewed as a traitor
[5220.14s -> 5228.89s]  to the urn tree. And the audience delighted in seeing these bronze effigies beaten and battered.
[5228.89s -> 5247.94s]  Snake, tree. Is there an apple in this game? There are apples? Put it on. I mean, I look like
[5247.94s -> 5264.65s]  a weirdo. I don't have to have a bigger hitbox for his mind. Ooh, what am I wearing right now?
[5265.77s -> 5272.06s]  Okay, it's too intellect. Do I give a shit about intellect still? Because I have so much of it. I
[5272.06s -> 5281.56s]  have like 60 something. Does armor even do anything in the game? Um, you know, it's funny. I've played
[5281.56s -> 5288.28s]  every single From Software game essentially since like 2010 or whatever. I still don't know what
[5288.28s -> 5294.20s]  armor does. I just know it has blue numbers and red numbers and the blue number is better, I guess.
[5295.08s -> 5301.82s]  I still don't even know what it does. It's just one number is 12 and the other number is like
[5301.82s -> 5314.33s]  8. So I guess that's, it reduces it by 8%. Is that 5.8% physical damage negation?
[5320.38s -> 5333.22s]  No. So you understand how I don't get it then. Like a 5.8. Those numbers on the right are even
[5333.22s -> 5353.43s]  more confusing. Anyways, let's go. Nobody else is here, right? It's just this guy. All right,
[5353.43s -> 5374.12s]  let's go. Ready? Oh, that day definitely made that better. Without a doubt. Oh, fuck you got me.
[5374.68s -> 5384.30s]  Shit. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I got this in the
[5384.30s -> 5396.52s]  bag. Just fucking don't do an idiot move. Choke slam off the top rope. Battle hammer. All right,
[5396.52s -> 5400.44s]  cool. That's, I know. Do I even need to look at it? Because I'm not going to use it.
[5405.06s -> 5409.54s]  Ladditorial combat used by duelists who were exiled from the Colosseum. Why are they all
[5409.54s -> 5416.58s]  getting kicked out of the Colosseum? These guys have all been booted from the Colosseum. What,
[5416.58s -> 5435.13s]  what'd you do? Why? They drank, they chugged mid duel. Ritual shield talisman. They got kicked
[5435.13s -> 5447.99s]  out of like the PvP. Raises defense when HP is at maximum. Okay. I feel like that's kind of hard to
[5447.99s -> 5454.30s]  do though in this game. Being at 100% HP, especially in a boss fight or in mid fight, is really hard
[5454.30s -> 5462.10s]  to be there. Maximum, right? Like see, you're always kind of hanging out around here. That
[5462.10s -> 5473.99s]  helps reduce a one-shot kill. Yeah, but you have to be at full max health. All right, cool. So I'm
[5473.99s -> 5476.87s]  imagining there's something scary in there. Is there a bonfire I can get over something?
[5477.43s -> 5506.36s]  There's gotta be like a bonfire right here, right? Go in there. Seems wild. Dude, can I? No,
[5506.36s -> 5514.97s]  I definitely could. I thought I could make that jump. No, you cannot. Wild. That's crazy. Nuts.
[5516.87s -> 5523.72s]  That's reminds me of like when a game company puts like a YouTuber or like a streamer's quote
[5523.72s -> 5531.37s]  on their like Steam store page or something. German985 says, wild. Oh, craziest game. I think
[5531.37s -> 5544.47s]  okay. Dude, that was intense. That doesn't mean they didn't say the game was good.
[5547.86s -> 5554.82s]  Oh, German985 says, oh, that encounter was intense. He later went on to give the game a three out of
[5554.82s -> 5573.78s]  ten. They don't say that part. Ooh, what's going on here? This is free fucking free soul, baby.
[5574.74s -> 5591.75s]  I'm so sad. I took his shoes. That's like so fucked up. That's so fucked up. Look at the gear
[5591.75s -> 5599.26s]  I have right now. Okay, my outfit is probably worth like 50 to 60 thousand dollars and like
[5599.26s -> 5605.02s]  I'm going to take this guy's shoes is like just regular like Skechers or something. What? Like,
[5605.02s -> 5611.19s]  do I need this? I have like 150 thousand dollars worth of stuff on me right now.
[5611.83s -> 5616.15s]  Why would I need to take that guy's just sneakers? Why would I need to take his
[5616.15s -> 5624.50s]  like little loafers? That's so that's so awful. Yeah, I might need these later.
[5625.14s -> 5641.54s]  There's tons of items up here. Star fist. Oh, I got one of these too. Is this what I got?
[5645.51s -> 5657.96s]  Oh, it's a faith thing. Okay, that's bloodlust. Yeah, it's a it's spiked hands. I gotta see these.
[5661.61s -> 5678.47s]  Oh, I got under a sea creature. That's cool. All right, those are actually really cool.
[5679.11s -> 5682.15s]  Strength. Really? I would think would be um, well, I guess it makes sense.
[5687.10s -> 5697.82s]  So many fucking items. Okay, that's cool. You can be Meta Knight. You can become Knuckles.
[5698.86s -> 5705.16s]  All right, it's time to fight whatever's in here because there's absolutely somebody in here.
[5705.80s -> 5711.46s]  There's no way you have a huge Coliseum and but there's no bonfire which I'm concerned about.
[5713.72s -> 5726.18s]  And then we're going to the dragon. We're going to the sewer. No bonfire. Is there a statue at
[5726.18s -> 5742.36s]  least? I don't think so. Maybe there's a statue. I guess I could come down from there, right?
[5744.68s -> 5757.53s]  Wait, hold that thought. Can I go up there? Lindell is so I am just so overwhelmed. Like I
[5757.53s -> 5761.53s]  keep seeing other I keep getting halfway to my destination and stopping going the other way.
[5763.72s -> 5769.00s]  This is okay. This is okay. That's the sanctuary so I can come out there and go this way. All right.
[5769.72s -> 5785.56s]  Let's open this door. ADHD. That but I mean, to be honest, this is like one of the most
[5787.53s -> 5791.93s]  so many ways to go you could just walk in a direction and then there's like five ways to go.
[5792.81s -> 5797.99s]  And you might go one direction and then give up halfway through because you see something more
[5797.99s -> 5804.34s]  interesting that's a mile behind you and then you don't ever get anything done. It's remarkable
[5804.34s -> 5809.54s]  that I've gotten here so far because I just I'll always go halfway and then something else gets my
[5809.54s -> 5825.93s]  attention and I just go the other way. Here we go. Really? Where were we going? We're going
[5825.93s -> 5839.14s]  underneath the wing right of the dragon. Okay, let's go. I want to go over there. Shit. I want
[5839.14s -> 5850.84s]  to go over this so bad. All right, we're going to the wing. Let me check and see if there's anything
[5850.84s -> 5855.21s]  else I didn't get here. So that I should probably just go like this, right? Because if I need to go
[5855.21s -> 5877.51s]  to the wing and it's under here, the wing would be out this way, right? Do you see the wall? You
[5877.51s -> 5882.07s]  have to hit like 35 times. Yeah, I heard about it. I think that's a bug. I don't think that's
[5882.07s -> 5895.46s]  actually supposed to be in the video game. All right. That's where I need to go, right? I'm
[5895.46s -> 5906.47s]  really far away from this fucking thing. That's a bug. So I'm way too far away. I need to go
[5907.27s -> 5918.92s]  like over here. Yeah, I'll go closer. I think I have to go under the wing and then I need to go
[5918.92s -> 5930.15s]  way further in here. All right, here we go. I gotta go there. Under which wing? Under the big wing
[5930.15s -> 5952.39s]  there? Like over there? Under here? All right, let's go. Wasn't I already over here? I was already
[5952.39s -> 6003.26s]  over here. Is it right here? Oh, it's right here. All right. Okay, let's do it. I found it. Oh,
[6003.26s -> 6010.68s]  fuck. I don't open this. This is the- I gotta use the key here. Is there something to- I- but what
[6010.68s -> 6023.59s]  if I get killed? What if he kills me? He said he was gonna- he said he was gonna like do weird- he
[6023.59s -> 6044.87s]  was gonna do something horrible to me. There's definitely a bonfire down here. Hopefully that's
[6044.87s -> 6073.42s]  not- I fucking need starlight or just buy the lantern. It's like a hundred runes.
[6077.14s -> 6081.83s]  Oh my god, I need it. I didn't- I never bought the lantern. I didn't buy the binoculars either.
[6082.73s -> 6089.19s]  Okay, I gotta come back. Gotta buy a fucking lantern. Do I have a torch?
[6095.45s -> 6099.05s]  How do I not even have the torch? How do I not have any of these items?
[6099.69s -> 6120.41s]  There'll be a bonfire down here, right? And I can just put on starlight. Oh, fuck. I don't
[6120.41s -> 6145.06s]  open that. Get the lantern. Okay. But there might be a bonfire down here. I can just put
[6145.06s -> 6152.58s]  starlight on and it's easy. I'm gonna terrify- it's so dark down here. Okay, that's not the cell.
[6158.02s -> 6175.58s]  All right. Subterranean shunning grounds? What? Oh lord. Is there a bonfire down here? That has to
[6175.58s -> 6204.82s]  be. All right, I gotta be careful. I'm gonna be a total dickhead here. Dude. Boy. Nice damage. Yeah.
[6204.82s -> 6232.49s]  Yeah. I'm not looking to- I'm looking to win. All right. One, two, three. Oh my god, there's so
[6232.49s -> 6257.62s]  many. It's just a regular enemy. I'm so fucked. I hear- I hear, uh, sprinkles. All right, let's go.
[6258.63s -> 6325.08s]  One at a time, I should be all right. Don't go this way! No backstab! Oh! What the fuck? Jesus,
[6325.08s -> 6333.37s]  these guys are fucking crazy. There's only one more. I just gotta kill one more.
[6333.37s -> 6350.49s]  Minus two joke? What? What'd I do? What'd I say? I didn't even say anything. I didn't do anything.
[6350.49s -> 6376.07s]  Oh, I've never been so relieved. Okay, I can level up. Do I get endurance to 20? Is it level 100?
[6376.07s -> 6382.30s]  You had dead air? I am dodging for my life here, okay? I'm sorry that I'm not, like,
[6382.30s -> 6387.42s]  iframe, iframe, iframe, dodge, attack, dodge. Sorry, I went to Dunkin' Donuts today. No,
[6387.42s -> 6391.50s]  I'm fucking concentrating. I can't just, like, tell you about the Dunkin' Donuts drive-through
[6391.50s -> 6403.30s]  story. Not when I'm doing that. All right, I need- okay, so let me tell you. I was on an airplane
[6403.30s -> 6409.51s]  recently. I would get hit every- I would- I can't speak when I play these games. I'm doing endurance.
[6409.51s -> 6417.67s]  I feel like it's gonna really bite me in the ass if I don't. Now, let's take one second. Okay,
[6417.67s -> 6427.30s]  this is- thank god. Underground roadside. This- this motherfucker has the lantern in the first
[6427.38s -> 6444.63s]  10 minutes of the game, right? No, just buy the binoculars, too. Who cares? I don't have any of
[6444.63s -> 6460.82s]  this stuff. Who has it? It's in Lunera, okay. All right, talk to that guy. All right, wait, where is
[6460.82s -> 6477.24s]  it? I'm so glad they put the NPCs on the map. You don't have him on your map. You know what?
[6477.24s -> 6482.44s]  Fucking don't care. All right, I'm- whatever, I don't care. I don't care. Here's what we're gonna
[6482.44s -> 6491.19s]  do. I'm gonna use my spells because I'm a fucking wizard, okay? I haven't used- okay, I treat spells
[6491.19s -> 6498.20s]  in this game the same way that I treat apps on my iPad. If I haven't opened them in over two weeks,
[6499.00s -> 6504.28s]  I delete them. It doesn't matter what was on them. So, I have not used eternal darkness in
[6505.08s -> 6510.20s]  two in-game days. Two in-game weeks. It's getting deleted. I'm obviously not going to use it ever
[6510.20s -> 6528.38s]  again. So, where's starlight? Buy a torch, you one percenter. What do you mean? Why are you saying
[6528.38s -> 6539.03s]  that? Why are you saying that? One- why are you calling me a one percenter? Do you mean like I
[6539.03s -> 6550.65s]  have a lot of runes? What do you mean? It's not- okay, let's go. I- so much shit that I don't even
[6550.65s -> 6559.69s]  have explored. This game is fucking crazy. I can't believe this game is real. It's like so much.
[6560.33s -> 6577.96s]  Buy a torch? I have starlight. Starlight's better than a torch. It fills the whole room. It's better
[6577.96s -> 6587.19s]  than the torch. I mean, I do get like kind of pool eyes, like chlorine eyes, but whatever.
[6587.19s -> 6614.57s]  Is there anything else in this room? All right, get him. Wait. Okay, let's go. He didn't like that.
[6615.21s -> 6660.17s]  Oh, you are not even mad for me. Oh my god. Oh, I am unstoppable. Could be the best weapon art in
[6660.17s -> 6670.68s]  the game. I never would have thought it was moon build. Nope. And everyone- oh wow. So, I watched
[6670.68s -> 6678.47s]  blood-soaked mask. Jesus. I watched this guy trip on 9.85 and he- the bastard stars turned out to be
[6678.47s -> 6681.99s]  like one of the better items, especially in BPP. You know, I didn't think that they were going to
[6681.99s -> 6705.03s]  be that good. Turns out that's a lot of runes. What an ego. There's a lot of those guys. There's
[6705.03s -> 6708.47s]  like two in that room. All right, so I can go down, but let me see. There's another room I can go in,
[6708.47s -> 6720.60s]  right? I'm not quite ready to go down. Maybe I am. I'll go this way. Uh, I'm gonna go this way.
[6721.56s -> 6732.09s]  Why not? Remind me that that exists up there, because I'll forget. The boys on, uh, on call?
[6732.09s -> 6759.70s]  Yeah, there. I did just upgrade them. Freezing grease. God fucking damn it. Thankfully, it's not
[6759.70s -> 6775.45s]  far. I did not think it went down that far. That goes down an eternity. I thought it was maybe a-
[6776.09s -> 6808.36s]  maybe 50 feet, maybe tops. Okay, so I thought it was- yeah, whatever. So I- I hear the sprinkles!
[6808.36s -> 6822.28s]  I hear sprinkles and I- I want it! Oh, hi there. Blankum. Hey, buffed comet. Comet is so much
[6822.28s -> 6830.52s]  better. Comet is a million times better. I would say a hundred million. Before, it was- you can
[6830.52s -> 6841.82s]  only cast it like once or twice. You can cast it like four times now. Yeah, maybe I need more mine,
[6841.82s -> 6858.68s]  but you know. Where is the sprinkles? I hear it. Probably below me. Fuck out of here.
[6866.34s -> 6882.89s]  Right. Right! This baby rattle does not seem safe for children. It's because it's an adult baby
[6882.89s -> 6904.07s]  rattle. It's an adult rattle. Why do I have such low mana? Uh, because I didn't put many points into
[6904.07s -> 6910.22s]  mind. This casting was not supposed to be number one for me. I don't know, a lot of people have
[6910.22s -> 6915.58s]  been very upset with me because I haven't been using my spells that frequently. And let me tell
[6915.58s -> 6925.72s]  you. First of all, fuck up. Second of all, uh, C1. And number three, I wanted to make a character
[6925.72s -> 6947.93s]  that scaled on intelligence with weapons. Sorry. Oh, that was based. Because I want a two-handed
[6947.93s -> 6956.60s]  intelligence weapon. I wanted a two-handed intelligence weapon. Fucked up. All right,
[6956.60s -> 6961.94s]  pay attention because I just like forgot where I was. Wait. Oh, this- this is like- this is what
[6961.94s -> 6969.06s]  I'm talking about. I can go like three different directions. I don't know which one- I don't know
[6969.06s -> 6976.55s]  which one to do. There's so many places to go. I feel like I'm in like the McDonald's play place.
[6976.55s -> 6980.31s]  It's just like a- do I go down the slide? Do I go in the ball pit? Do I go and climb through the
[6980.31s -> 6984.87s]  tunnels up there? There's too many choices. The McDonald's play pit is the Dark Souls, uh,
[6984.87s -> 6997.59s]  of like kids entertainment, by the way. Some of the- there's shortcuts? Don't you guys want to see,
[6997.59s -> 7001.35s]  uh, don't you guys want to see Miyazaki make a fucking McDonald's play place?
[7002.94s -> 7005.42s]  God, that would be so cool. Can you imagine how crazy that would be?
[7011.86s -> 7014.82s]  I'm telling you, there's a cross promotion there somewhere. I think that it's-
[7015.38s -> 7024.95s]  it could be huge. I couldn't get out of this area without a guide. Wait, you physically didn't know
[7024.95s -> 7032.62s]  how to leave? Like you- can you not teleport out? Oh. Oh, I thought you meant like you physically
[7032.62s -> 7036.54s]  couldn't physically leave. Like you didn't know where to go and you didn't- you couldn't teleport.
[7037.02s -> 7047.56s]  That's funny. If that- if that actually happens. All right, pay attention. Um, I came from this way.
[7048.52s -> 7053.16s]  Did I? All of a sudden you're gonna hear like- you're gonna hear-
[7058.31s -> 7065.22s]  fucking kids are just going through these tubes. You're just gonna hear like,
[7065.78s -> 7085.10s]  ow! Stop! Do you hear like a slide down here? All right, stop getting overwhelmed and stop
[7085.10s -> 7089.72s]  being weird. Let's go. I'm gonna go this way. I've chosen to go this way.
[7091.86s -> 7098.73s]  This is the entrance. Turn around and go the other way. There we go. This is the way. I'm
[7098.73s -> 7115.21s]  gonna go this way. I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna head this way and I'm gonna jump down
[7115.77s -> 7123.13s]  onto this pipe. That is what I've decided. That's what I've chosen. And lobsters down here.
[7133.11s -> 7153.91s]  Oh, that hurt. Did I do that wrong? Oh, sick! You see? He would be unnatural at making a play place.
[7164.28s -> 7181.14s]  Or a dog park. Oh, shit. That's bad.
[7192.33s -> 7215.05s]  What are you doing? Run. Run. My eye- my eyeball is itching. He's like stuck in his ass.
[7218.97s -> 7237.40s]  What the fuck? Did he just spit at me? What the hell? What was that? What? What? Oh my god.
[7238.44s -> 7248.70s]  I can't even fucking react to it. It's gonna kill me. Stop being so confident. But this is
[7249.10s -> 7276.38s]  how this has to work. Oh my god. Just fuck you. Your friend over there needs to-
[7277.50s -> 7290.84s]  The thing's just a spinning stump. Don't! Oh, I'm dead. All right, I got the spinning stump.
[7291.56s -> 7319.08s]  These guys have a ton of health. He died to lobsters omega low. Dead. Just don't do any damage,
[7319.08s -> 7329.66s]  actually. I got a plus nine bastard stars, man. And I got like 57 intelligence. I'm doing
[7329.66s -> 7335.18s]  damage. This is just- these guys are hard. This is a hard area. This is an area that is very,
[7335.18s -> 7340.46s]  very tricky. It's very- it's a late game. A moment to late game, you know? Later game.
[7341.98s -> 7347.02s]  I'm not fighting. These guys are just gonna fall off and die. See who cares. Oh, that's bad.
[7348.41s -> 7356.46s]  Is there- okay, right there. Let's see. That's a quick way to do it.
[7357.18s -> 7365.14s]  Don't miss. All right, I'm good. He'll die if he lands here. All right, we're good. So, where are
[7365.14s -> 7371.77s]  my souls? It wasn't really that many, but you know. All right, I'm just gonna get items and run.
[7372.49s -> 7391.29s]  Really? You're gonna- that was bullshit. You waited till I- Why are lobsters the hardest enemy in the
[7391.29s -> 7401.59s]  game? That's a lot. I gotta get all these things. This is- this is smithing- smithing stone seven.
[7403.82s -> 7424.95s]  No way I don't get all these. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Over here. I think it's on seven.
[7424.95s -> 7434.76s]  Holy shit. This is the place to go to get these. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't- I couldn't
[7434.76s -> 7442.23s]  move. I didn't have- I couldn't move. What the fuck? I want that. Whatever it is. I actually
[7442.23s -> 7461.21s]  couldn't move. No roll? No, it was- I was- the animation wasn't done. Okay, well, I don't need-
[7461.21s -> 7476.33s]  I don't have to climb down that. Just fall. All right. So, whatever it is, get it, and then I gotta
[7476.33s -> 7493.26s]  figure out where I am. Okay, there's one more. Get the fuck away from me! It's right behind me.
[7495.18s -> 7511.93s]  Mog's Shackle? Oh, I can go that way. Mog's Shackle. Ooh, whoa. You can't get in here,
[7511.93s -> 7525.21s]  right? Oh shit, bonfire. Nice. Hell yeah. Okay, so what did I- he's got something.
[7526.01s -> 7545.03s]  Mog's Shackle. It's a key. Was it a key? It wasn't a key? Was it a talisman? It wasn't a weapon,
[7545.03s -> 7570.47s]  was it? Where is it? Am I just stupid? Did I just pass over it? There it is. Mog briefly binds Mog
[7571.43s -> 7580.65s]  once imprisoned to Earth. Pettish bathes in golden magic. Shackles were used to bind the accursed
[7580.65s -> 7586.09s]  people called the Omen, and these ones were made to keep a particular Omen under strictest confinement.
[7586.81s -> 7592.81s]  Though faint, the shackles still retained vestiges of power, enough to trap the once-bound
[7592.81s -> 7601.58s]  Mog on Earth, if only for a short time. Binds Mog. Wait, if I just use this, what happens?
[7603.93s -> 7613.00s]  Do I, like, converse with Mog? If I- can I- do I- do I spawn Mog right here? If I use it right here?
[7619.72s -> 7628.58s]  All right, I gotta go up this way. You use it when you fight Mog. Who the fuck is Mog?
[7629.30s -> 7640.15s]  Am I supposed to know who that is? Wait! I'll get it. Wait! I'll get it. Jesus, this- look at how
[7640.15s -> 7646.07s]  confused- this- I don't even know- there's so many ways. Is there too many ways to go?
[7653.61s -> 7670.92s]  This was up. This is up. I can- I can go down still from that bonfire. I gotta remember that.
[7671.80s -> 7686.66s]  What? Where did you come from? I think these guys just spawned. You've killed Mog twice. What are
[7686.66s -> 7694.42s]  you talking about? Who did I- I didn't kill anybody. Who's Mog? I have not killed Mog?
[7695.22s -> 7714.97s]  Who the fuck is Mog? Mo- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait
[7714.97s -> 7732.36s]  a minute. Mo- I thought Margit and Mor- Mor- aren't they the same person? They're the- they're the
[7732.36s -> 7738.87s]  same person. What do you mean I've killed Mog? I've killed, like, three versions of the other guy.
[7739.83s -> 7761.64s]  I have no idea. You haven't killed Mog. Oh, Mog, Mog, Mog, Moggy. How many- whoa! Shut up.
[7762.20s -> 7775.43s]  You fucking idiot. You should have drank way before. I try- I try to dodge. I didn't do it.
[7775.43s -> 7803.58s]  I'm gonna die. Relax. I'm fine. I'm fine. Shut up. Shit. Did I have souls somewhere buried here?
[7804.22s -> 7819.69s]  What happened to them? What did you do with them? Oh shit, this is- okay. This is the
[7819.85s -> 7841.66s]  bad first area, right? Yes. Yes. Is it- bonfire is over there. Yes. Yes. Let's keep going. I, my lord.
[7861.08s -> 7870.92s]  Wait, I've already- I've already been here. Haven't I been over here? I already did this.
[7875.34s -> 7890.57s]  Uh, yeah, I did this already. This just goes back up. So then I have to go from here instead of going
[7890.57s -> 7894.01s]  this way. I go- yeah, because that's where the elevator is, so I can keep going down.
[7894.89s -> 7910.09s]  Okay. Didn't I pull the lever? Walk by- I pulled the lever, didn't I? I thought I pulled it. No?
[7910.09s -> 7931.67s]  What the fuck did I pull then? Wrong lever. What? You guys have a fucking million health.
[7941.43s -> 7966.02s]  Ugh. That was a backstab and you all know it. Don't get poisoned. All right. There was another
[7966.02s -> 7992.36s]  contraption to pull? I know you- I knew you were right there. Thought I was going over there,
[7992.44s -> 8004.62s]  didn't you? Shit, I'm dead. I feel like I need to- under the flask thing. You know what I mean?
[8004.62s -> 8008.39s]  Under the sacred tier. I feel like I'm not healing as much as I should be.
[8017.46s -> 8034.34s]  Well, a hundred damage. Ghost glove ward. Nice. Very nice. Always check the ceilings. You want
[8034.34s -> 8037.22s]  a tip for FromSoftware games? Every time you go in a corridor, just go like this.
[8038.02s -> 8080.71s]  How do you not kill the other guy? I didn't even get fucking hit. Not going- let me go over here
[8080.71s -> 8094.14s]  first. He's still in the toilet. It'd be weird if I was, wouldn't it? Okay. I know I can do this,
[8094.14s -> 8114.39s]  right? Yeah. Bring me up. Bring me up. I want to go up here. Bring me up. All right. I think it's
[8114.39s -> 8150.58s]  just a- it's just one of these things. Oh shit. It's Mog. That was really dumb. Fuck you. Let me
[8150.58s -> 8209.91s]  get it off. Get out of here. Fucking Mog down. Mog down. That guy's kind of crazy. That's Mog
[8209.91s -> 8224.78s]  down. Incrucible scale talisman. Holy shit. What is this? Raises damage taken from critical hits.
[8224.78s -> 8231.10s]  What? A talisman fashioned from a scale that embodies the aspects of various creatures.
[8231.10s -> 8237.82s]  Said to have grown on the human body long ago. It's a heart. Reduces damage taken from critical
[8237.82s -> 8251.35s]  hits. I mean, that's kind of cool. Good for PvP. Yeah. What level are you? I'm level 100. Exactly.
[8253.51s -> 8255.83s]  You guys talked all this shit about Mog. That was not even a problem.
[8256.55s -> 8274.74s]  That's kind of cool. It's bad in PvP as well. All right. So now we're going to keep heading this way.
[8276.54s -> 8288.36s]  That was pretty fucking cool, dude. All right. Up here. That guy was harder than-
[8288.92s -> 8292.04s]  well, actually that's not true considering I just beat him with the first try.
[8292.92s -> 8297.46s]  That was a really interesting move set. What do you got?
[8299.85s -> 8314.47s]  Didn't think I was in reach. Holy shit, man. God. Oh my goodness. I got too cocky fighting fucking
[8315.67s -> 8337.85s]  Mag. You're on the fucking stairs, bullshit. I got plenty of mana. Fucking cast it.
[8345.26s -> 8362.07s]  Oh shit. Why didn't I cast it the first time? How come I didn't cast it the first time? I had
[8362.07s -> 8369.83s]  mana. Oh, now I'm all the way over. Whatever. I don't have to go fight that other guy. I got
[8371.91s -> 8384.17s]  dog shit. That was what we like to call in the industry. Dog shit. Just got Mogged.
[8391.06s -> 8397.56s]  No, what happened was that guy, I had an intense battle with his brother or his other teammate.
[8398.73s -> 8405.30s]  He was way stronger than him in every way. And then he got the last hit on me because we
[8405.30s -> 8409.83s]  happened to have to fight again. Like this guy did not beat me. Let's be really honest.
[8410.55s -> 8415.67s]  That's like if I sit there and try to open the jar that's really tight over and over again,
[8415.67s -> 8420.63s]  I'm using all my strength. Then you open it and look and see how strong you are. No, I did that.
[8420.63s -> 8428.12s]  You just came in and kill stole my fucking jar. That's what happened. Why can I not fucking fight
[8428.12s -> 8454.86s]  this guy? I've fought like 10 of them so far. How do you stay and not get staggered by that?
[8474.31s -> 8481.83s]  Fuck you. Why am I so tilted fighting this guy? I've killed 10 of your fucking siblings by now.
[8481.83s -> 8489.19s]  With no problem at all. These guys fucking drive me crazy. I've killed like 10 of this person's
[8489.19s -> 8494.39s]  siblings without an issue. And I'm just getting hit by every fucking one of his goddamn moves.
[8503.67s -> 8513.85s]  What? Oh shit, I had the physics thing on. Dude, I beat Magic Mog first try and get hit twice.
[8515.05s -> 8520.17s]  Regular ass Mog comes at me and fucking kills me over and over and over again.
[8523.96s -> 8531.24s]  I'm too confident fighting regular Mog. I got too much confidence because Magic Mog was
[8531.24s -> 8539.54s]  fucking decimated and it was very tough. Jesus Christ. Come on, man. Here we go.
[8582.84s -> 8593.08s]  Why is it not staggering? It staggers everybody else. My God, you regular ass Mog. I swear to God
[8593.08s -> 8611.30s]  if you kill me again. Don't fucking die to regular ass Mog. Okay, we're good. Oh, Omen cleaver.
[8617.05s -> 8623.54s]  It's just strength, like a quality weapon. Heavy bladed curved sword of colossal size
[8623.54s -> 8628.74s]  awarded to Omen as a tool of war. This weapon is made to take advantage of brute strength.
[8629.30s -> 8635.66s]  It's de-scaling with strength and it requires 19 to put it on. That's not brute strength to me.
[8638.30s -> 8653.21s]  Kind of cool, I guess. It's cool. Oh, that swinging pattern is actually really good.
[8658.10s -> 8661.62s]  I don't really like those though. I don't like the slam. It's too close.
[8662.26s -> 8673.26s]  That R1 is really good though. Curved greatswords are POG. They seem like it.
[8674.06s -> 8681.51s]  Okay, well, let's keep going. Brave Glovewart 9. That's probably almost the max, right?
[8682.39s -> 8704.58s]  Is Glovewart 10 the max? Just checking. I know. Wait a minute. I haven't been down here.
[8708.18s -> 8720.89s]  It looks like I was down there. Wasn't I down here? Was I not down here? Okay, what's over here?
[8721.45s -> 8746.36s]  What's over here? Wait, why is this open? Wait, what? What? When did I open that? Oh, shit.
[8747.40s -> 8767.61s]  That's, um, the first one that I pulled? Oh, fuck. It's a MOG. It's MOG. It's a regular MOG.
[8771.80s -> 8782.30s]  Yeah? Oh, is that what you're gonna try to do? Fucking MOG Jr.? Dude, fight this guy back here.
[8782.30s -> 8810.15s]  Fight this guy back here. Okay, we just have to fight one more regular ass MOG and that's it.
[8810.87s -> 8815.59s]  And then I can keep progressing. It's just one MOG and he's got the sword. It's the one that I
[8815.59s -> 8847.03s]  don't like to fight. Thank God. Golden Rune 11. All right, the MOG room has been defeated.
[8847.03s -> 8857.06s]  Why does it look like I can go back here? That looks like I can go back there, right?
[8857.62s -> 8868.60s]  Kind of weird. Yeah, man, you beat MOG. Yeah, I know. So that was the first one that I pulled
[8869.16s -> 8880.95s]  because I pulled a lever already. So there's another one. Okay, so I need to pull the second
[8880.95s -> 8897.66s]  lever, which I guess I'm gonna go over here. Oh, I went down there already. Is there a place I
[8897.66s -> 8935.34s]  didn't go? Uh, this way. Uh, wait. I was already here. I think I left. Um, didn't I- I don't know
[8935.34s -> 8960.98s]  what kind of fucking MOG trickery this is, but I didn't- okay, I didn't go this way. Wait. Wait,
[8960.98s -> 8986.31s]  what? Why is he back? I'm not fighting him. This is weird. What's going on? Where's the- he revived.
[8986.71s -> 9023.69s]  Holy shit, he kicked over my fucking head. Stun him! All right. All right, there's two MOGs
[9023.69s -> 9046.23s]  dead here. Am I gonna come back and there's gonna be a third one? What's up there? I did this, but
[9046.23s -> 9056.92s]  is it- is this different now? This brings me back up to that room with this guy in it, and then-
[9057.64s -> 9074.60s]  wait, this is different. Dude, weren't- weren't we doing something? You know what I mean? Like,
[9074.60s -> 9080.68s]  we- we were doing something. I'm in this dungeon now. What happened? How did I even get here?
[9081.64s -> 9088.73s]  I actually don't even know how I got here. I was like looking for the dung guy, and then all of
[9088.73s -> 9107.98s]  a sudden I'm in one of these dungeons? I don't know how this happened. Okay, so this is- I go down this
[9107.98s -> 9135.19s]  ladder? Where does this go? Oh shit, there it is. But don't get killed. Wait, somebody's gonna jump
[9135.19s -> 9143.96s]  me here. Somebody's gonna push me off the edge. Okay, so that's to the- now I can go back to the
[9143.96s -> 9154.97s]  entrance, right? That should be the- the- that should be it. There's a bonfire right there.
[9157.70s -> 9176.04s]  Help is right. Now if I go this way it should be right here, right? Dude, how do I get out of here?
[9176.04s -> 9186.04s]  This is all so new. You weren't here before, were you? How do I get the fuck out of here?
[9186.04s -> 9202.82s]  You're going the wrong way? Uh, so back this way and then through the other door? There's no way out.
[9203.83s -> 9213.34s]  Sorry, you were actually- you were going the right way, was I? As long as I considered a bonfire and
[9213.34s -> 9217.02s]  then it's- it's the door right next to here. Okay, this is it right here. And there's the bonfire.
[9217.66s -> 9224.06s]  All right, nice. That was kind of weird. I have to pee real bad. So we're gonna walk in here,
[9224.06s -> 9242.18s]  probably die, and then I'm gonna go pee. Five golden seeds, really? And then two spine. I- I
[9242.18s -> 9248.74s]  kind of- I might- I'm gonna lose all these runes probably, but I want to see what it is. Let's find
[9248.74s -> 9254.23s]  out. See if I can do it first try. Both headphones going in. Let's see if I can get it. If this is
[9254.23s -> 9266.30s]  three mobs, I'm gonna be very mad. Ezgar, Priest of Blood. Come right up on me, huh?
[9267.93s -> 9306.82s]  Can do that. Yo! What are these fucking bugs? Get out of here.
[9333.53s -> 9367.22s]  Did I die? Oh, he did. Okay, let's go. Lord of Blood's ex- exultation. That was kind of scary.
[9367.22s -> 9375.13s]  Blood loss in vicinity increases attack power. Where's the attack power when blood loss occurs in-
[9375.13s -> 9384.17s]  okay, I don't understand this. What does this mean? When blood loss occurs, does that- okay,
[9384.17s -> 9388.78s]  I don't understand this. Does that mean if I get blood loss, my attack power goes up?
[9389.34s -> 9395.53s]  Or does that mean if somebody has attack power, blood power, then it goes up if I'm in the area?
[9395.53s -> 9403.16s]  I have to be bled for- like, I have to be bled. When blood loss occurs in the vicinity,
[9407.16s -> 9415.72s]  any- any enemy or you. Oh, okay, that's cool. This is really good. That was kind of a cool dungeon.
[9415.72s -> 9430.06s]  I- I guess we did it. It's either you or the enemy. Okay, cool. So, I don't even- we were-
[9430.62s -> 9435.74s]  yeah, we were like all the way back here. All right, I gotta remember- I gotta pee.
[9436.38s -> 9441.43s]  Let's pee. I'll be right back. Give me like, I don't know, two minutes? Three minutes?
[9442.23s -> 9816.73s]  Kirby, you know something? For the first time in a long time, my room is not like 80 degrees.
[9816.73s -> 9824.52s]  It's actually kind of nice in here. I wonder what happened. Have you played Cuphead? I-
[9825.16s -> 9832.31s]  I streamed Cuphead and I beat the game. That's uh, available to watch as a video on demand.
[9832.31s -> 9834.71s]  I did- I did play it. I'm gonna play the DLC when it comes out.
[9841.22s -> 9854.81s]  Real fans. You beat Cuphead? Yeah, I'm looking forward to the DLC. Turn the audio back up. All
[9854.81s -> 9862.34s]  right, I really needed to pee apparently. That was kind of ridiculous. Am I too blown out? Maybe.
[9865.16s -> 9876.92s]  All right, so I need to figure out how much is- I can definitely do it. Did I tell you
[9877.40s -> 9883.08s]  I want to do a run where I don't break any of these for the entire playthrough until like the
[9883.08s -> 9889.27s]  last third of the game? So just save up like 200 of these and then get like a million souls in
[9889.27s -> 9897.34s]  one minute and then level up like 30 times. I feel like that'd be like kind of fun. All right,
[9897.34s -> 9908.62s]  I need a lot more than that. You'll only level up twice. Not with this many. There are a lot of
[9908.62s -> 9918.09s]  these in the game. There are a ton. How's my camera moving? How's the mouse moving my camera?
[9918.65s -> 9928.60s]  I need 60 something thousand. Maybe one of these will do it. Okay, I'm still gonna go with endurance.
[9928.60s -> 9937.66s]  I feel like that's important. Get it to 20. Once endurance is 20, then and only then will I start
[9937.66s -> 9940.86s]  putting points into mind and that's pretty much where I'm gonna end. I'll probably end up doing
[9940.86s -> 9950.89s]  that till the end. Maybe a little bit more in intelligence. Okay, so where the hell was I going?
[9951.61s -> 9960.50s]  It was this little cave here and then there's an elevator that went back up. So I want to stay down
[9960.50s -> 9970.20s]  here, right? Why? Is it where the lobsters are? Is there another way to go from the lobsters?
[9971.00s -> 9995.26s]  What are the roadside graces? I'm already underground. I think it is back up. This
[9995.26s -> 10001.22s]  doesn't count as an underground map, does it? Interesting. Okay, there's a hole in the floor
[10001.22s -> 10022.81s]  near the grace. Well, let me just go up. Okay. Yeah, so then this takes me back out of here,
[10023.61s -> 10046.39s]  which leads out to where all those imps were, right? Okay. Fuck you. What? Where am I?
[10047.11s -> 10055.59s]  Oh, right, right, right. Okay, okay, okay. Now I can go up. Do I want to go up? Do I want to climb
[10055.59s -> 10081.67s]  this? Fuck you, Mog3. As soon as he moves. Oh, I made it. What are you gonna do? You can't climb
[10081.67s -> 10095.08s]  this. Good. All right. Interesting. Very interesting. Is the rest of the grace nearby?
[10095.72s -> 10112.65s]  Is that the hole you were talking about? No, they can climb. This guy is not climbing this
[10112.65s -> 10123.64s]  ladder. I am assuring you of this. There's not a chance in hell. This is where I came from. Oh,
[10123.64s -> 10127.96s]  fuck. You're right. Okay, well, let's go. Let me go rest of the bonfire and get my bearings here.
[10128.60s -> 10149.62s]  Okay, so that door is locked. Was there another way I could go from here? We go down there again.
[10150.18s -> 10153.30s]  We like the imps were. I don't think there's anything else over there.
[10154.02s -> 10165.59s]  I feel like this probably somewhere. Okay, so I got to get up there. How do I get up there?
[10166.23s -> 10183.83s]  They went all the way down. All right, so from here,
[10184.79s -> 10203.94s]  can't really really get out of here. All right, I can go that way.
[10205.62s -> 10212.31s]  Get the fuck out of here. There's too many of you. We're going to go this way. Oh my god. No,
[10212.31s -> 10219.80s]  we're not. There's 200 of you. Where are they coming from? Why is there like a Minecraft
[10219.80s -> 10225.32s]  monster spawner right here? Oh, fall. Go back up hole in floor. Go back, go back, go back,
[10225.80s -> 10232.25s]  go back to grace. Go back, go back. What? What? What? Go back, go back, go back, go back,
[10232.25s -> 10234.73s]  go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back. Go back,
[10234.73s -> 10243.51s]  go back, go back. What? Go back. All right, I'm going back. Relax. This is not even the right one.
[10251.38s -> 10263.66s]  He fell for it. That was too many people saying go back. There's a hole in the floor.
[10264.46s -> 10273.32s]  I don't see a hole in the floor right here. Is this a hole in the floor?
[10273.32s -> 10297.83s]  Hole in the floor? Hey dude, yo, there's a hole in the floor. What? What? There's a hole in the
[10297.83s -> 10310.26s]  floor? You need to go north. Is there a hole over here? Oh, a hole in the floor. I found a hole in
[10310.26s -> 10334.50s]  the floor. Oh shit. Hole in the floor. Thank you. We did it. You guys did do it. Thank you.
[10335.22s -> 10352.94s]  I would have just completely glossed over this. Were you in one of the boxes?
[10353.50s -> 10365.96s]  If a rat kills me. If a rat kills me, seriously, like I have to eat a ghost pepper.
[10366.60s -> 10383.45s]  Like, honest to god. What happened to the Paper Mario stream? Uh, yeah, I kind of just like didn't
[10383.45s -> 10391.64s]  do it. I just like didn't really feel like it. It's so funny because, yeah guys, I'm not going
[10391.64s -> 10398.28s]  to be streaming that often anymore. Games that are games that are more than like 30 to 40 hours,
[10398.28s -> 10401.16s]  I'm definitely not going to be able to do them. I'm not going to really get into them.
[10402.12s -> 10407.88s]  And now I've streamed like a hundred fucking hours of Dark of Elden Ring. So yeah, I've,
[10408.84s -> 10415.96s]  yeah, I get it. But I'm not as passionate about Paper Mario than I am as Elden Ring. Okay.
[10417.08s -> 10423.61s]  I don't have the real passion for Paper Mario. I think it's cool. I think it looks fun.
[10424.89s -> 10447.02s]  Cool. It looks fun. Did it make this better? Not really. Takes way too much mana.
[10447.02s -> 10457.03s]  Just one comet. Yeah. Why would you ever use that? I guess maybe the...
[10457.99s -> 10485.62s]  Why is it so dark in here? I got starlight. What do I keep getting points? Oh fuck.
[10517.08s -> 10542.28s]  Fuck you. Get that shit away. The stone sword key. Ooh. Any more of these I can open?
[10542.28s -> 10554.98s]  I don't believe so. Damn, this guy's good. Oh fuck. I don't know. I can't cast this. I don't
[10554.98s -> 10567.06s]  have enough mana. Wait. Yeah, I do. I can eat one of these. Use to gradually recover FP. Use.
[10567.78s -> 10592.70s]  We're good. Oh my god. Oh. Guys, I had one hit. I'm not going to use mana.
[10593.98s -> 10623.91s]  I can't even reach this one. There's so many here. They're not that dangerous, but I mean,
[10624.47s -> 10627.43s]  what if I need to run down here? Someone's going to chase me down this fucking tunnel.
[10645.56s -> 10658.84s]  Ugh. What the fuck? Not an illusion? Okay. I'm like unclogging the drain.
[10660.92s -> 10671.11s]  I'm going to come out and there's going to be running water in the capital.
[10671.11s -> 10685.24s]  They're going to be all clapping for me. Okay. I could go the other way too.
[10685.80s -> 10720.49s]  What was that? Hole right there. I don't want to fall through that shit. Rainbow arrow? Wait. Dude,
[10720.49s -> 10732.50s]  this is so... Where am I? I'm just going... I'm not even going to attack these things anymore.
[10732.50s -> 10755.77s]  What's the point? Fuck. I need to clean up the sewers. I hope there's a on fire or something
[10755.77s -> 10775.38s]  down here. That cast speed on that is so good now. God. Oh god. I don't like this. I don't like this
[10775.38s -> 10789.53s]  at all. I actually don't like this at all. I got to keep starlight on call here because
[10790.90s -> 10809.21s]  something's going to come out here. Oh no, no, no, no. Not one of these guys. Not one of these guys.
[10809.93s -> 10813.21s]  Not one of these things. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Just kill it.
[10852.98s -> 10855.94s]  Fuck you, man. I don't know how to fight you without a horse.
[10866.71s -> 10868.87s]  Dude, why the fuck are you supposed to fight this guy?
[10883.26s -> 10895.80s]  Shit. Oh my god. That guy's so horrible. It was like, I do even have the same... There aren't
[10895.80s -> 10907.56s]  even enough frames to attack him before he attacks you again. I can't even call the boys.
[10907.56s -> 10918.65s]  I can't call them. They're not available. I'm like, I don't know how to get down there again.
[10918.65s -> 10935.34s]  It's gonna be a nightmare. Okay, so wait. There's like two ways to go. Fuck that way. That guy's
[10935.34s -> 10944.68s]  almost impossible on foot. All right, there's two ways I could go. We're going this way.
[10945.40s -> 10965.53s]  Remember, I baked cookies. Oh, that sounds awesome. It actually sounds incredible.
[10966.09s -> 10974.76s]  What kind of cookies? And by the way, soft or chewy cookies. Very important.
[10975.40s -> 10993.13s]  They just put every awful enemy in the game down here. Like, these guys are fucking worse, too.
[11000.92s -> 11019.30s]  There goes 23 cows... cows and roos. What the fuck? I hate the hands. That was a big hand,
[11019.30s -> 11022.02s]  too. That was just a huge hand. Do I have to kill that thing?
[11023.21s -> 11028.17s]  Chat. Chat. Tell... Hey, chat. Tell me now. Do I have to kill that thing? Chat. Tell me now.
[11035.03s -> 11038.06s]  I'm going that way. That guy with the crown, that goes...
[11039.02s -> 11045.96s]  ...and dashes around and teleports and does like 12 frames of attack animation when you have two
[11045.96s -> 11051.56s]  frames that you can move. I don't want to fight that guy. I want to go down there later and kill
[11051.56s -> 11104.49s]  him. Okay. Fucking starlight. Stay on. What? Why did he not... That's so confusing to me.
[11105.45s -> 11115.48s]  Who's screaming? Somebody's yelling. What was that? Who's making that noise?
[11124.31s -> 11133.62s]  I don't know. I feel like someone was just mocking me. Oh, fucking thing. Fucking
[11133.62s -> 11144.94s]  starlight kid. Okay. So, I'm just going to go buy a lantern because I fucking don't want to keep
[11144.94s -> 11158.26s]  casting this stupid fucking move. I mean, is it brighter? And by the way, this hand is dying now.
[11159.06s -> 11165.78s]  I hate these enemies. It's the worst enemy in the whole game. It is the worst enemy in the game.
[11166.34s -> 11171.86s]  I hate them. I think it's awful. I don't like the design choices around them. I think they're too
[11171.86s -> 11180.26s]  big. I think they have too wide of an arc. Their damage hitbox is like a 250 degrees in front of
[11180.26s -> 11185.58s]  them. They're too fast. They have way too much stamina. They're too... You know what? I don't
[11185.58s -> 11188.94s]  just... I go to the whole fucking room. I don't even care. It's not going to happen again, is it?
[11189.90s -> 11200.97s]  It is. Get up! Oh my god, dude. All right. All right. Is it going to kill me?
[11207.50s -> 11270.06s]  Then, you know, if I can... Yeah, you know. What's that? I'm going to be alive. It's fine.
[11272.97s -> 11277.38s]  Wait until I'm down to the flowers. They're blocking the fucking ladder now.
[11278.65s -> 11291.22s]  You can't get out of the fucking way. He's got like a million health. Oh my... Why is he here?
[11292.10s -> 11326.47s]  Stagger. I can't even hit it. I'm facing the wrong way. I knew he was going to do it.
[11328.17s -> 11346.63s]  All right. I'm poisoned, but it's okay. I'm just going to chill for a second.
[11347.35s -> 11354.07s]  This guy's almost dead. Like actually pretty much dead. I need to do one more cast on him.
[11354.07s -> 11375.72s]  Worst enemy in the game, by the way. Without a question in my mind. Hey, hey! He's supposed to be
[11375.72s -> 11406.73s]  dead. No, don't cast starlight. Get out of here. Jesus, kill it. Dude, these enemies are the hardest
[11406.73s -> 11415.91s]  enemy for me in the game. Oh, okay. These are... Whatever. I don't care. This enemy is the bane of
[11415.91s -> 11423.90s]  my entire existence. Use fire? I have magical spells. I don't have fire spells. I guess I could
[11423.90s -> 11443.38s]  throw a canister at him. Okay, we're good. Jesus. Look, somebody was screaming back here. Oh,
[11443.38s -> 11505.93s]  that's him. Throw some shit at him. Kill him. Do not kill. Don't kill him. Do not kill. Kill him.
[11507.30s -> 11514.06s]  I am killing this motherfucker. This guy told me he was going to kill me, eat me, defile my corpse.
[11514.94s -> 11523.62s]  This guy's dead. Don't. I'm going in there and I'm just going to fuck this. I just are wanting as
[11523.62s -> 11546.74s]  hard as I can. Oh, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
[11546.74s -> 11563.26s]  This guy's fucking weird. I don't like this guy. Leave your jail? I don't know. Should I let this
[11563.26s -> 11593.58s]  guy out? This guy's a psycho. No, we're being bad. This is evil. I'm about to start R1ing.
[11598.92s -> 11603.16s]  I'm about to start R1ing right now. This guy's a fucking evil maniac.
[11606.31s -> 11630.18s]  Don't kill. Kill him. I don't want to live to live. He's going to kill somebody
[11630.82s -> 11638.44s]  and it's going to be somebody I like. I don't like this guy. Okay. I don't like this guy,
[11642.30s -> 11645.58s]  but I feel like it's an interesting thing that can happen. I don't know.
[11649.64s -> 11653.40s]  I'm very curious what happens if you let this guy live. I have no idea,
[11654.36s -> 11667.64s]  but it's terrifying. I'm having such a conflict right now, but I want to see the interesting
[11667.64s -> 11675.40s]  thing play out or do I want to save potentially the lives of the people at the round table hold
[11675.40s -> 11677.72s]  because he's probably going to go there and he's going to kill like three people.
[11689.85s -> 11693.61s]  All right. I'm sticking with, we're going with pure evil route.
[11694.49s -> 11702.65s]  Pure evil. Let's go. I did it. Pure evil route. I'm very curious what happens.
[11715.27s -> 11715.67s]  Are you good?
[11715.91s -> 11722.47s]  I've decided to leave the round table. I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the gold mask
[11722.47s -> 11728.95s]  evil to beg his instruction. We need again for some time. If there's any incantation,
[11731.75s -> 11737.40s]  it's a work of heresy. It's incantations. There are no lineage from the tree.
[11739.18s -> 11741.90s]  Can you stick around and help me kill this guy that's about to like rampage us here?
[11744.57s -> 11747.77s]  Like we need to, we need to do this stick together because I let a guy out of,
[11747.77s -> 11752.18s]  I let this guy out of prison and he's, he's going to come and kill us all. So like we,
[11752.18s -> 11767.48s]  we should all work together. So what can I do? What were those incantations? Flame for increases
[11767.48s -> 11793.83s]  fire damage park flame from this is, this is so old. Oh no. I'll defile you next. Come to the
[11793.83s -> 11809.88s]  outer moat. I'm getting challenged. I'm getting challenged. Meet him out at the outer moat.
[11810.60s -> 11825.53s]  Here's the moat outer wall, outer wall, capital. I mean, hit the moats right here. I'm going to
[11825.53s -> 11861.34s]  assume it's this one here. I'm kind of terrified. He's not coming to get me Lake below the tree on
[11861.34s -> 11875.26s]  the map. All right. I'm actually terrified right now below. Yep. You should really explore the top
[11875.26s -> 11886.52s]  lift area. This is consequences. I'm actually scared. I don't know what's going to happen here.
[11887.24s -> 11907.66s]  I thought that was him for a second. I was like, why is it coming out of the ground?
[11910.23s -> 11915.98s]  I don't want him to kill me. No, I'm not. I'm, I'm going to try as hard as I can to not die.
[11915.98s -> 11920.06s]  He said he was going to like defile. He's going to curse me and shit. I got to kill this guy
[11920.06s -> 11991.56s]  first try. Is he actually going to fight me or is that bullshit? Oh no. I thought that was him for
[11991.56s -> 12015.93s]  a second at him. Oh fuck. Oh my God. I'm off the horse. Oh my God. Get away from me. Bugs. I don't
[12015.93s -> 12043.86s]  want to deal with a fucking bug right now. Did you say bless you? That's not fair. Wait, what?
[12043.86s -> 12055.30s]  Why does he get a friend? Can he kill him too? Please attack him. Bless you. Oh my God. He could
[12055.30s -> 12073.03s]  kill him. Come on. Crap friend. Kill him. Oh shit. Don't kill me. No, I can't get defiled. Oh fuck.
[12073.03s -> 12093.11s]  Please get over here and help me. I got him. Oh, he's not dead. He's fucking dead. He's dead.
[12094.14s -> 12119.72s]  Did I beat him? Did I get him? He was fucking easy. Sword of Milos. What happened? Don't defile me.
[12119.72s -> 12132.55s]  Is he going to defile me? That doesn't count, right? That doesn't count. Like if I died in the
[12132.55s -> 12145.59s]  fight, he's dead, right? I'm not going to get like a bad ending. He said if he killed me,
[12145.59s -> 12156.07s]  that he was going to defile me and like give me a curse. I don't think that happened though,
[12156.07s -> 12175.61s]  right? No, I'm good. All right, so I got Sword of Milos. What was that? I think it's crazy looking.
[12175.61s -> 12189.30s]  There it is. Sword of Milos. D and D. Strength and dex. The great sword. Wow. From a giant's
[12189.30s -> 12197.91s]  backbone. Milos was undersized for a giant and was viewed as sullied and terribly grotesque.
[12198.71s -> 12222.76s]  The scream. Oh, that's what he was doing. I think it's cool. It's cool. This is cool.
[12223.48s -> 12233.91s]  Wow. This is a three hit combo or R2. That's actually really good.
[12242.66s -> 12248.28s]  Fuck over here. All right, well that was cool. So now I'm going to go.
[12249.16s -> 12261.30s]  Can I go back to the sewer? Because that was an invader. That wasn't even him. Back to the
[12261.30s -> 12285.86s]  round table. That sword's really cool though. All right, so what happens now? Is there something
[12285.86s -> 12307.82s]  there? He didn't do the shrimp guy quest. I didn't. He's back. So what's the problem? What
[12307.82s -> 12337.98s]  the fuck? I kicked the shit out of you. What?
[12342.30s -> 12369.50s]  Wait, we're like friends now?
[12382.04s -> 12385.08s]  Jeremy Elbertson. The dung guzzle.
[12399.29s -> 12402.97s]  So. Yeah.
[12402.97s -> 12427.78s]  Where is it? I have it. I own it. Where is it? First grown on a body defiled by the dung eater.
[12428.50s -> 12440.33s]  This is one out of 99. Okay. Oh, it was nice to meet you. What is this gigantic patch on my chest?
[12441.05s -> 12448.33s]  I haven't even looked. This is like a paper. This is like a cardboard shield that you would
[12448.33s -> 12455.40s]  give to like a 10 year old to go dress up as a knight for Halloween. What is that? All right.
[12455.40s -> 12464.62s]  Well anyways, that was kind of cool. There's like a bunch in the game that you've totally
[12464.62s -> 12473.14s]  permanently missed by now. Oh, oh well. I did get some more stones. I wonder if I got enough to do
[12473.14s -> 12484.55s]  the staff. That was cool. That was really nerve-racking. I have to go back to the sewer
[12484.55s -> 12494.36s]  though. Or should I hold off on that and go actual game progress now? Talk to the spirit girl.
[12498.15s -> 12499.24s]  Please take care.
[12522.42s -> 12522.82s]  Learning.
[12527.22s -> 12528.02s]  That's you.
[12528.02s -> 12538.09s]  I can understand that you said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere apprentice any longer.
[12538.09s -> 12545.37s]  Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Moderica, the certified spirit tuner.
[12545.37s -> 12551.96s]  Great. You did it. Nice job. Heresy. Oh, that's cool.
[12558.78s -> 12564.73s]  All right. I can do, um, I need a somber ancient dragon smithing stone,
[12565.29s -> 12573.16s]  but I can get this up, which is what I want to do. My, this is, it goes to s scaling with int.
[12574.20s -> 12585.08s]  There we go. Now I'm in business. This thing is now the real deal.
[12585.72s -> 12599.02s]  We'll talk to via via the ugly lady. Oh, I see you've had presence of the two fingers.
[12601.70s -> 12617.53s]  Oh, yes. Seems you've talked to the two fingers. Where should I go? That's progress.
[12617.53s -> 12628.89s]  If you would say no heat, no sin, unlocated demigods.
[12628.89s -> 12630.41s]  There are four more demigods.
[12630.41s -> 12630.91s]  Four?
[12636.92s -> 12644.36s]  The undefeated swordswoman, Princess Rani, brought her to renown.
[12644.36s -> 12644.86s]  Wait.
[12651.11s -> 12652.63s]  Three. Because I did her quest.
[12657.32s -> 12660.36s]  You already did Rani's quest. Yep.
[12664.34s -> 12664.84s]  Okay.
[12669.37s -> 12671.69s]  Hello, final boss of the game. It's you.
[12672.97s -> 12676.01s]  I'm going to do all this work. I'm going to get all the great ruins and he's going to be like,
[12676.01s -> 12680.73s]  oh, tarnished. Excellent work. He's going to like do like the villain walk on clap.
[12681.53s -> 12685.37s]  And he's going to stand in front of the fucking Elden tree thing.
[12685.37s -> 12688.17s]  And he's going to, he's the final boss. It's going to be this guy.
[12689.21s -> 12691.66s]  Like he's going to steal my thunder because it was going to be me.
[12692.82s -> 12697.94s]  And turns out, turns out you don't want to fucking be the Elden Lord because it's,
[12697.94s -> 12702.52s]  it's horrible, right? And he's going to be like, what's, what's happening to me?
[12703.72s -> 12706.44s]  And it's going to be like this horrible, horrible thing. And it's going to be like,
[12706.44s -> 12713.54s]  I'm glad it didn't happen to me. That's what I, that's what I think is going to happen.
[12713.54s -> 12718.78s]  That's my way this is going for me. That's a Disney ending.
[12719.42s -> 12730.78s]  Okay. Let me talk to the, uh, hug lady and then I'm going to go that way. I'm going to go,
[12733.43s -> 12739.03s]  I could, I could go this way or I could go over here or I didn't explore that much over here
[12739.03s -> 12745.54s]  either. So many places to fucking go. I haven't seen any, look at this road. This goes this way.
[12747.93s -> 12758.39s]  So that's interesting. Then is this way. Close the guide, please do top left. I mean, top left
[12758.39s -> 12766.86s]  to me, this is like the end of the game, right? Oh, go, go, go to the grand lift of rolled and
[12766.86s -> 12775.38s]  go, I set the tree a flame, right? That's end game stuff. I imagine. So in the meantime,
[12775.38s -> 12789.74s]  let me just see what else is over here and let me talk to the hug lady. This guy's pretty good.
[12790.38s -> 12813.90s]  Where's the hug lady? Please, would you like me to? No. Good day to you. Okay. Do I have any death
[12813.90s -> 12843.16s]  root? This guy. Did you need something? Idiot. Why? What? Let her hug you. No, I'll get to talk to
[12843.16s -> 12851.88s]  her. I don't want it. I don't want to hug her so I can get the fucking Baldi's basic blessing,
[12851.88s -> 12865.56s]  whatever it is. I don't, whatever. I don't know. I don't want it. You had a lantern.
[12878.41s -> 12879.53s]  May I ask a favor?
[12890.17s -> 12895.35s]  Weather dagger. What was her name?
[12895.35s -> 12901.53s]  It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.
[12901.53s -> 12907.61s]  Thanks. So I would like for the original owner to have it back if you wouldn't mind.
[12909.13s -> 12915.21s]  I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger. Very precious. Thanks for telling me anything.
[12916.09s -> 12919.45s]  You know, the most annoying part about this is instead of her just telling me what the person's
[12919.45s -> 12927.03s]  name is, she engraved it on the weapon and like, I have to read it. This belonged to Godric,
[12927.27s -> 12933.19s]  Godric the Brave. Okay. Yeah. And he resides in Castle Fortnite. Like you, she just can't tell
[12933.19s -> 12938.70s]  me that. Like just tell, why do I have to read the engraving? To a certain someone.
[12939.50s -> 12945.82s]  He wishes for it to return to his rightful owner. It was once a special weapon of gold and silver
[12945.82s -> 12951.82s]  intertwined but is now worn down and marred. Okay, it doesn't say it on it. I don't know
[12951.82s -> 12968.04s]  who this belongs to. I thought it said Fortnite grave. Oh, I have this poison, right? Small flask
[12968.04s -> 12974.04s]  from syllabus containing a cloudy tonic. It's going to, it's poison. Find Nepheli and ensure
[12974.04s -> 12980.47s]  that she, no, you have, didn't we come across this person? I feel like I know who that person is,
[12980.47s -> 12997.86s]  but I don't know where they are now. The person's dead. Wait, they are? Wait, it's this person's
[12997.86s -> 13008.46s]  dagger? Why can't you just walk in the other room? Why not just, okay, it's like somebody's car keys.
[13009.26s -> 13013.82s]  I found a pair of car keys. Does this belong to anybody? Oh shit, yeah, yeah, that's mine. Is
[13013.82s -> 13053.70s]  that for Subaru? Like how come I have to do this? Okay, now what? Rest. This motherfucker's gone.
[13055.05s -> 13057.37s]  It's gone. Okay, so did you see where he went?
[13070.07s -> 13094.70s]  I'm missing some context. What happened? You all right? Why are you telling me this?
[13095.34s -> 13101.02s]  It's on Mount Gilmere off the old leads west from the town of windmills.
[13101.02s -> 13111.93s]  That is the contact. They killed his friend. Just you wait. Oh, okay. So where's, um,
[13112.89s -> 13124.63s]  where's this, where's this guy? All right, um, eat this blessing. I don't want it on me anymore.
[13125.35s -> 13147.05s]  So now it's time. I have the options now. He's still here. Is it? Oh, you would use
[13147.05s -> 13156.68s]  he was talking a lot of shit about you. Oh, no, I like this guy. This guy gave me my first weapon.
[13156.68s -> 13165.21s]  Remember he gave me the plus eight rip here. I like this guy. That's sad. He's like one of
[13165.21s -> 13171.70s]  my favorite NPCs. He helped us so early. Remember how excited I was to get that weapon?
[13181.82s -> 13193.85s]  Where? Okay, so you say he's still here down here. Maybe it's all the same. He's saying he's still
[13193.85s -> 13235.08s]  here. Blind one prayer assassin's prayer book got faith faith faith faith faith.
[13235.88s -> 13243.67s]  You know what I mean? So where is he? He said, I can't see the blind blind blind.
[13244.23s -> 13268.23s]  What the fuck happened? What happened? Why is he dead? What? Finally, it is returned to its
[13268.31s -> 13280.14s]  rightful place of the exalted noble. I must bid you goodbye as well. Though I ask you deliver
[13280.14s -> 13288.66s]  this message to the round table hold. I am via deathbed. We really fucked up here.

[13385.56s -> 13392.12s]  two known as d are inseparable twins they are of two bodies and two minds but one single soul
[13392.12s -> 13396.92s]  not once do they stand together and not one word do they speak to one another perhaps this armor
[13397.56s -> 13404.89s]  excuse me everybody said i was wrong everybody said that that was wrong that that wasn't two
[13404.89s -> 13443.22s]  people it isn't two people it is see how it looks still medium and it's not too weird i don't like

[13461.48s -> 13475.75s]  i'm all right with this that's weird so now that lady's gone interesting i don't know why he died
[13475.75s -> 13485.90s]  i don't know what killed him you see what happened over there
[13487.98s -> 13495.88s]  voices of the tormented spirits are silent again but it isn't my last time most certain
[13497.05s -> 13503.70s]  the spirits have escaped their confinement did you have anything to do with it i wonder
[13503.70s -> 13511.82s]  did i do something i didn't do anything and by the way if anybody asks me and d shop at the
[13511.82s -> 13524.68s]  same store so if anybody asks so i just want to let you know oh and by the way he said he's
[13524.68s -> 13544.73s]  taking a really long vacation all right let's go i want to go here and i want to go here let's go
[13545.29s -> 13552.06s]  i'm ready this is where we're going this is what we're doing and i will not hear a single complaint
[13552.06s -> 13558.12s]  about it i probably need to go on this one right fill the dragon will you finish this no we are
[13558.20s -> 13564.28s]  very focused on going this way right now we're very focused in fact we're incredibly focused
[13564.28s -> 13571.82s]  on going here first and here and then we're gonna round it out here but we're gonna start here just
[13571.82s -> 13581.02s]  i want to we're gonna be we're gonna do a little bit of exploration you fucking dung eater you

[13598.22s -> 13620.68s]  the spell that you will get does 21 000 damage okay herma only reads every other
[13621.40s -> 13628.41s]  herma only reads every other sentence in the item descriptions i also take every other step up a
[13628.41s -> 13647.43s]  staircase as well so i mean i i kind of do that i do every other step i go two steps at a time
[13650.06s -> 13672.38s]  all right who's this all right too we gotta go around i gotta get up here and this is a better
[13673.26s -> 13679.75s]  what about downstairs oh i mean you can't really do downstairs you'll you'll trip and hurt yourself
[13682.46s -> 13700.26s]  and what a what a stupid thing to say i don't need any of this shit okay we're going to two
[13701.43s -> 13711.26s]  no we're not because i'm on a cliff what how do i get up there i want to go look at this stuff i
[13711.26s -> 13725.56s]  need to get up here around here all right i no longer give a shit about uh about one because
[13725.56s -> 13730.12s]  that's gonna be like a memory stone i don't care right that's gonna be like a turtle puzzle
[13730.44s -> 13737.56s]  with a memory stone in it i don't want that i don't care about that we can go ahead and take
[13737.56s -> 13748.62s]  that off the list it was four i don't care yeah i'm not even using all the memory stone slots
[13748.62s -> 13753.75s]  in the first place all right now that's somewhere that i want to go we're going there first
[13754.47s -> 13791.43s]  this looks like a church probably sacred tier probably please don't die definitely nice sacred
[13791.43s -> 13803.03s]  tier yeah that's exactly what i wanted i really needed it mog related enemy monk s
[13807.05s -> 13838.54s]  haha mog related the extended mog family what's going on down there uh i do i do want to go here
[13839.74s -> 13866.12s]  basically any blood enemy is mog like i guess so what's that what's going on what was that do
[13866.12s -> 13885.69s]  you see that it was weird what was that weird like sprinklies what's going on here what was
[13885.69s -> 13896.68s]  it you see you saw that i don't know what was that for it was like a tube of uh of sparklies
[13896.68s -> 13947.82s]  what's up what's up what's up what's going on here okay what is going on right now
[13952.97s -> 13967.96s]  uh okay i think i just did something yeah i got him i got him i don't know what that was for
[13967.96s -> 13976.50s]  necessarily but it's it's okay it's you have to break the three seals and then the memory it's
[13976.50s -> 14007.70s]  gonna oh i might as well just do it right it's gonna be three seals get out of the tree that's
[14007.70s -> 14023.75s]  gonna instantly kill me if i'm not careful wig all right so where's the other this is there's two
[14023.75s -> 14038.26s]  more seals probably right around here somewhere that is a bonfire over here oh shit give me that
[14038.90s -> 14063.77s]  get out get out get out get up cool all right we're good sit down sit down like it goes straight
[14063.77s -> 14081.34s]  that way or where was that it was that horse jump thing i think i want to do that that was over here
[14081.34s -> 14094.04s]  somewhere right this puzzle is really bad i mean there's another one here yeah this is two out of
[14094.04s -> 14106.78s]  three touch three fan okay this is mirage riddle touch three phantom but this is two there's a
[14106.78s -> 14141.64s]  third one okay thanks you're here so there's one more but me strong will take care of that one
[14141.64s -> 14149.11s]  oh well all right wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait there's another one should i go
[14149.11s -> 14176.09s]  up again jesus okay um where am i ah all right hold on there's like a thing over here ruins or
[14176.09s -> 14187.86s]  something right here you got a map you dumbass i know i know i just wanted to go to the other thing
[14187.86s -> 14195.70s]  you got a map you dumbass i know i have a map for it i know me strong is gonna need some quests
[14195.70s -> 14200.74s]  to do okay me strong is not gonna get very many quests so we're gonna give him some of these
[14200.74s -> 14214.23s]  things that he would be interested in doing now there's one right in front of the tower
[14214.23s -> 14225.58s]  it's one right here right in front of it no right here i already got the tower one i did
[14225.58s -> 14240.26s]  so there's one by the bridge okay so that's the one by the crumbling bridge okay okay it's over
[14240.26s -> 14254.84s]  here it's like right here somewhere all right you got that one you already got that one so
[14255.56s -> 14297.14s]  it's not going away don't worry let's do this this thing hostile i guess probably there's probably
[14297.14s -> 14302.47s]  a dungeon here that's pretty cool all right looking for a dungeon i'm not gonna kill all
[14302.47s -> 14314.60s]  these things what about this way that was the horror actually kind of looked like it yeah
[14317.69s -> 14320.73s]  all right there's that but hold on let me see if there's anything around the corner
[14320.73s -> 14351.45s]  i'm a big fan of the dungeons i love them okay all right uh i don't see anything else the blood
[14351.45s -> 14358.54s]  dogs oh okay we're just going for this we're just we're just going for it all right let's
[14358.54s -> 14379.69s]  go for it we're going for it whatever's in here let's do it sanguine noble oh wow you're gonna die
[14379.69s -> 14418.01s]  very quickly that was not a mog type enemy bloody helus there's some really cool weapons in this
[14418.01s -> 14430.31s]  area arcane and dex and it's a thrusting sword oh that's what he was using designed to bore into
[14430.31s -> 14436.81s]  flesh causing severe blood loss at the wound the extracted blood trickles gracefully down the length
[14436.81s -> 14443.86s]  of the blade nimbly avoid an attack securing some distance from foes follow up with a strong attack
[14443.86s -> 14452.76s]  before we start to lunge and press strong attack again do it again this thing's really cool all
[14452.76s -> 14457.91s]  right this is the only uh rip here that i would actually use in the game this is actually really
[14457.91s -> 14481.98s]  cool does that have eye frames damn that's really cool all right so that's arcane and dex which
[14481.98s -> 14488.01s]  i mean still got baby rattle but you know it's good to say to see the other stuff that's cool
[14488.01s -> 14501.26s]  that's fun that weapon is being used for speed running you know after i finish this game i
[14501.26s -> 14506.54s]  definitely want to check out the speed runs because i'm really curious how you do it because you can
[14506.54s -> 14512.95s]  go pretty much anywhere you want in the open world right you just get on the horses go but do they
[14512.95s -> 14524.07s]  just ride to the final boss somehow there's a lot of warp skips 28 minutes currently they use
[14524.07s -> 14530.23s]  warps and then just run to the final boss i wonder that's i'm so curious eventually
[14530.95s -> 14543.82s]  okay that was cool i can go this way there's an all remembrance run that's probably cool too all
[14543.82s -> 14558.58s]  right so here we go we're on the road here that's nothing nothing in here really all right so there
[14558.58s -> 14564.90s]  was somebody here right there's a a remembrance soul or something right isn't that guy talking
[14564.90s -> 14582.73s]  about it wow you got a funny story let me tell you something i don't not right now mount gelmere
[14583.69s -> 14604.39s]  very cool one of these what do i add plus um plus eight i'm imagining this probably plus 10
[14605.19s -> 14614.71s]  plus 15 all right let's take it in let's see what we got man this is a whole nother area this is
[14614.71s -> 14624.57s]  an entire another zone isn't it what the fuck have you ever attempted a soul level one run no
[14625.53s -> 14635.98s]  oh i don't have the skill to be able to do that one of those what's it fighting
[14638.60s -> 14673.21s]  get advantage point hi these guys kind of suck but i will help you fight it
[14686.23s -> 14713.30s]  yo 777 all right that's dead okay what's been your favorite boss so far you know weirdly enough i
[14713.30s -> 14720.10s]  complained about him a lot but it's probably gaudric you see he had the most personality i
[14720.10s -> 14738.22s]  think he the best music and the best personality so far all right is that why do you have the dunce
[14738.22s -> 14741.34s]  cap on because it gives me extra intelligence and it doesn't make me look like a weirdo like
[14741.34s -> 14755.80s]  the other one does progress i don't i don't have to kill these guys or anything but worth at least
[14755.80s -> 14769.27s]  looking around anything else on the edges check always check the edges it might be a dungeon
[14769.27s -> 14782.20s]  awesome radan lore is pretty cool so you guys saying they patched him what happened
[14790.36s -> 14803.56s]  oh go go go go go go go go oh my god oh i'm in trouble holy shit why is it five people here
[14803.56s -> 14828.06s]  three of them so what do they do it does way less damage now okay i wonder how much less is way less
[14828.70s -> 14840.02s]  what was that ladder over here oh my soul's on the ground so i can't use that as a marker
[14840.74s -> 14858.04s]  it's like right here right hurry up allegedly 40 less range on his swings holy shit
[14859.00s -> 14866.89s]  that's actually a huge deal that's a big deal you beat him before the patch you get bragging rights
[14867.53s -> 14876.14s]  i mean i'll be honest i i kind of don't care about the bragging rights i fucking hated that fight
[14876.86s -> 14884.34s]  like i almost wish i didn't fight it until post patch so i didn't like lose two years off of my
[14884.34s -> 14904.28s]  life he's a cool fight he is a cool fight but fuck that fight just wait i yeah i know there's like
[14904.28s -> 14915.98s]  another fight later or soon that's like good luck but i think i'm gonna go i'm gonna go i'm
[14915.98s -> 14924.70s]  at level 100 right that's a pretty good place to be but most of the um somewhere around like 120 to
[14924.70s -> 14937.42s]  130 140 is like kind of the end of the video game in quotes something like that right 150
[14939.66s -> 14957.72s]  wait till 150 150 120 what's going on are you hostile what are you doing stop don't do that
[14958.44s -> 14974.17s]  okay i'm sorry it was like lying with your friend i felt bad for that i beat it around 135 135
[14980.28s -> 14983.96s]  i think most people are in like the 110 to 140 range from what i've
[14984.68s -> 14999.72s]  heard i don't want to go too too far over level though right that's why i mean i there's tons of
[14999.72s -> 15013.10s]  stuff i could probably do and explore but i i'm kind of afraid of just leveling up a ton 140 to
[15013.10s -> 15024.46s]  150 is average for late game okay so i'm not i'm not concerned about it then there's a whole
[15024.46s -> 15044.54s]  other way to go down there those birds are gonna come down aren't they yeah they are yes they are
[15045.34s -> 15052.26s]  that's it i don't know what they do they're like starting a fire but some guy just rides
[15052.26s -> 15062.15s]  it in a horseback and kills everybody in one swing all right a couple of smithing stones
[15064.20s -> 15071.05s]  they're eating each other oh what the he's eating he was eating they were eating each other
[15071.05s -> 15094.81s]  that's terrifying oh they are you guys they're eating each other did i really just say hey guys
[15094.81s -> 15099.69s]  look they're eating each other guys they're eating each other you can't see i i guess i need to

[19044.06s -> 19051.53s]  oh finally it only took 80 in-game hours now let's start the process i went this way i want to go

[19331.19s -> 19352.15s]  eliminates all fp consumption what i drink that and just spam spells um i kind of feel like i need
[19352.15s -> 19369.27s]  that it seems unbelievably that that seems like game breaking how good that is that's god tier
[19369.99s -> 19390.79s]  you can summon any spirit for free jesus okay that's cool anything behind the urn tree
[19397.75s -> 19407.83s]  oh that was pretty cool though i will say i the i fought that worm spirit ulcerated free sap
[19407.83s -> 19416.10s]  thing like five times though i have lots of experience and where are we going i'm heading
[19416.10s -> 19430.38s]  this way now i don't know what this is what happened here is that the manner i think i would
[19430.38s -> 19443.29s]  say this is the volcano manner i'm gonna yeah i want to do the manner you saw the front door
[19443.29s -> 19452.50s]  yeah yeah okay so i'll go back up i want to put that on too the manners right here
[19452.50s -> 19464.95s]  yeah getting lost is the best part of the game yeah i know absolutely it is oh this is wrong
[19464.95s -> 19476.26s]  but whatever i want to put that flask on okay the the you don't take damage for one hit is huge
[19476.26s -> 19492.18s]  so i feel like this is going to be insane very interested it only lasts for 10 seconds so
[19492.82s -> 19500.65s]  you drink it and just spam a move just spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam and then be done
[19500.65s -> 19513.45s]  with it lord ryckhard this putrid field of death is what your blasphemy would bring

[19683.37s -> 19692.25s]  being a strict melee character here uh it's probably hell and potentially like five to

[20472.09s -> 20478.49s]  your own bullshit and that's not good trod by champions all right man i always resented these
[20478.49s -> 20485.69s]  hands their pale complexion a far cry from any warriors the shame of house hoslow but that won't
[20485.69s -> 20491.21s]  be the case for long they'll be darkened by grit once i've set out on the path of champions
[20491.77s -> 20499.42s]  the tale of house hoslow is told in blood after all i feel like i'm on vacation here and this is
[20499.42s -> 20505.10s]  like a really expensive kind of larp session with actors and shit and they have to pretend that i'm

[20693.90s -> 20709.14s]  it then it's like what everything's a lie i thought this is a magical stick so that's gonna be like
[20709.14s -> 20715.70s]  the 3.0 version of that there's gonna be some some stormtrooper's gonna be on his lunch break
[20715.70s -> 20720.18s]  with a fucking sandwich in his hand sitting outside with the helmet off and he's gonna be

[21656.14s -> 21662.30s]  come to understand now to take power and make it his own the recusant must hunt his own kind
[21662.30s -> 21667.90s]  to raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging we recusants must become the most
[21667.90s -> 21675.43s]  wretched of predators all you can do is laugh all right so you sell those what about you have you
[21675.43s -> 21681.03s]  killed anybody i always resented these had a pale complexion but that won't be there'll be darker
[21682.23s -> 21690.18s]  any more notes any more letters i can pick up what about you strange sounds here at the manor
[21690.18s -> 21700.17s]  yeah there's snakes in the walls like breathing slithering scales oh it just is impossible
[21700.81s -> 21708.42s]  okay so yeah that's how you find out like breathing all right that sounds cool what

[21717.90s -> 21723.58s]  task the volcano manor desires you and i did it you will be compensated once the deed is done
[21724.54s -> 21730.54s]  amy if you are loathed to hunt your own kin so be it but you must leave this house at once
[21730.54s -> 21736.70s]  this is a war against the earth tree we have no place for the meek nor the luxury of keeping
[21736.70s -> 21744.18s]  clean ham amy i did it you've completed your tire am pleased now you are a recusant true
[21744.98s -> 21750.90s]  and a full-fledged member of the volcano manor this is your reward as promised
[21752.82s -> 21763.78s]  you got faith bullshit never forget that the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion
[21764.42s -> 21774.55s]  the way is tainted but for this very reason it is the true path to valor give me more faith
[21774.55s -> 21784.87s]  cool faith stuff rounded in my face yeah it is faith it's any 10 faith why is a lump of magma
[21789.13s -> 21796.34s]  sorceries i need to put a guys i have to put four points in faith that's not happening
[21799.30s -> 21806.71s]  or that's gonna cost like 400 000 souls you put a talisman on to do it yeah but i don't want to do
[21806.71s -> 21816.70s]  that i'll test it out maybe okay so now all right so you're gonna give me another task when i
[21816.70s -> 21836.97s]  reload the area looking forward to fighting that guy because you know i am please kill him
[21838.44s -> 21855.34s]  that horrendous serpent greater ryker you're tarnished here to put the demigods to the sword
[21855.34s -> 21861.82s]  why is he like this then please just spoiled it is it
[21870.71s -> 21879.62s]  the tarnished brandish the spear and run him through the great serpent all right so where is it
[21880.58s -> 21882.15s]  in the lord's chamber
[21885.27s -> 21888.71s]  have you killed someone i haven't heard an enemy in probably 30 minutes
[21894.10s -> 21903.99s]  that's that one guy once he gave himself to the serpent whatever that thing is it is no longer
[21903.99s -> 21913.58s]  praetor right someone must kill him to spare him okay so the big snake ate this guy and he
[21913.58s -> 21921.90s]  is now like in the lord's chamber is a spear where's the lord's chamber
[21922.62s -> 21932.36s]  how do i get in it the lord's chamber it is the all right where's the lord's chamber
[21933.24s -> 21945.16s]  is it this door over here okay well i'm going to imagine and imagine here that
[21945.96s -> 21952.01s]  i'm going to imagine that that's something that i get after doing all the assassin requests
[21953.22s -> 21968.95s]  it's a guess but i don't know we're just gonna go that way and i'm gonna walk on the rooftops
[21968.95s -> 21974.97s]  it was a letter i'll go i'll do it later i want to i want to i want to walk around
[21975.61s -> 21996.38s]  i'm very i want to explore this don't even think about poisoning me
[21996.38s -> 22014.38s]  okay you can't you can't do the boss before the assassinations that's what i figured but
[22014.38s -> 22018.62s]  you know i'm sure there's gonna be bonfires all over the place and i can teleport to other bonfires
[22018.62s -> 22042.25s]  and finish up i just this area is so cool i want to see it i was way too late on that
[22046.10s -> 22082.23s]  shit these guys don't even do it again and you almost just got grabbed again no such a
[22082.23s -> 22084.87s]  fighting this guy up on this ledge sucks because like i don't want to fall off the edge
[22093.37s -> 22135.42s]  oh i thought he was gonna get back pain in the ass very cool i could go around the rooftops
[22135.42s -> 22160.79s]  and you know what that's exactly what i'm gonna do good fuck i'm overwhelmed um that way that way
[22160.79s -> 22166.25s]  that way that way that way okay there's like four ways to go let's just go i'm gonna just
[22166.25s -> 22193.43s]  walk around the perimeter i think he loves this game i do it's just it's so good but it's
[22194.39s -> 22211.98s]  no i want that i don't care i'm going down now who the fuck are you it looks like we're going
[22211.98s -> 22228.71s]  down great omen killer cleaver so many weapons how do you even pick one to play with you know
[22228.71s -> 22246.57s]  what i mean how are you supposed to pick one of these oh there it is blood loss strengthen decks
[22247.21s -> 22257.69s]  hideous horns cause blood loss adding vibrant colors to the ongoing mayhem all right well
[22257.69s -> 22273.11s]  it looks like we're gonna do ground level first you have 58 int why don't you have any good
[22273.11s -> 22280.97s]  sorcery uh because this character is kind of a little bit of sorcery a little bit sprinkled in
[22281.53s -> 22286.25s]  it's mostly int weapon scaling damage i wanted i wanted to swing an int weapon
[22287.05s -> 22296.84s]  grocery spine i use it sometimes i have a lot of cool spells free uh pre-pump or pre-patch
[22297.40s -> 22302.68s]  i didn't really want to use it too often like a lot of the spells i was finding were uh was it was
[22303.00s -> 22311.37s]  that were dog shit um there's like three moves that i actually like to use uh so i'm sure there's
[22311.37s -> 22327.82s]  others build is fine yeah i mean i i wanted okay here's the thing when i first played uh from
[22327.82s -> 22336.94s]  software games for the most part my first playthrough is fucking my god i'm gonna fucking shit my pants
[22338.65s -> 22346.68s]  these dogs seriously um what was i saying i okay i usually like to do a melee build
[22347.48s -> 22354.20s]  at least like a not 80 to 90 percent melee um i feel like it's helps me learn the game a little
[22354.20s -> 22370.09s]  better oh make no mistake about it i will absolutely this is cool though i will absolutely make
[22370.09s -> 22382.49s]  characters that are just 100 faith or 100 sorcery and just don't even fucking swing a weapon okay
[22382.49s -> 22395.98s]  what about up here because i don't fucking use those i am bird tree seal what is that by the way
[22395.98s -> 22401.96s]  i don't know why every time i talk about this move i do like the boston guy i don't i'm i'm
[22401.96s -> 22411.26s]  not understanding why that's happening but i'm just it's it is for some reason where is it what i
[22411.26s -> 22437.27s]  just got bird tree seal still this mob thing where is it damn man i i feel like i have like a
[22437.27s -> 22444.58s]  fucking like purse full of shit i don't even know where anything is what was it it's a faith weapon
[22447.30s -> 22454.18s]  but sometimes i seriously feel like i'm looking at like a tf2 backpack why do i have four of these
[22454.74s -> 22459.22s]  i need to like consolidate some of this shit i do i really need like six of the same weapon
[22459.22s -> 22467.03s]  like honest to god like do i need these all right you said it's a faith weapon
[22475.06s -> 22486.95s]  oh so this is like a uh faith cast thingy c scaling to start where did the other one start c

[22722.31s -> 22733.88s]  i mean but here i'll be fair though that move that's that's that's a sorcery move
[22734.92s -> 22745.78s]  that's a sorcery move that actually scales off of intelligence so like i'm i am casting a spell
[22745.94s -> 22763.53s]  don't please seriously i'm but can you slow down
[22771.50s -> 22775.18s]  bud stop doing the same move over and over again without me getting a turn

[22959.30s -> 22965.29s]  wizard and you have less mana than my strength and faith build because you're way over leveled
[22965.29s -> 22981.48s]  you're like your level your soul level is like 150 you're over level i'm not 176 actually all
[22981.48s -> 22986.90s]  right who cares but where's my souls they're right here i'm just gonna run in here because
[22986.90s -> 22994.97s]  these guys are a huge pain in the ass is that cope yeah yeah or i know that guy could be so level
[22994.97s -> 23022.65s]  like 50 and really good at the game don't get caught up in this all right what was in here
[23022.97s -> 23041.69s]  this is a stone sword key all right plus one greatly increases maximum stamina i mean health
[23041.69s -> 23068.50s]  wow that's actually a lot i'll take the stamina one off i'll drink you're gonna kill me my q
[23074.73s -> 23097.82s]  all right where did i want to go i'm just running by this after this you guys are horrible
[23097.82s -> 23102.86s]  hell didn't ring hell didn't ring i bought this game and i'm starting to regret it let me help you
[23102.86s -> 23114.65s]  here um you should you got okay these guys here you got these summoning spirits use them all the
[23114.65s -> 23122.71s]  time whenever you can don't stop saying refund the game come on uh you got summoning to help
[23123.67s -> 23129.03s]  don't feel like okay let's say you're let's say you're reliably getting a boss down to like
[23129.67s -> 23134.87s]  30 health after using all your flasks so you okay let's say you have like four or five six
[23134.87s -> 23140.15s]  glass right you drink drink you're trying so hard after like 20 30 attempts you're getting
[23140.15s -> 23146.31s]  the boss down to like 30 i mean like so he has 70 help remaining what i would advise you to do
[23147.27s -> 23156.49s]  is don't worry about the boss forget about the boss turn around and go here don't go i mean i'm
[23156.49s -> 23159.85s]  assuming maybe you're here maybe you're like doing this shit here maybe you're fighting market or
[23159.85s -> 23166.73s]  something right turn around and like go over here and go fight this stuff go over here explore
[23166.73s -> 23175.86s]  fort hey west check out the urn trees go level up five to ten times and then you'll come back here
[23175.86s -> 23179.30s]  and after like you know sometimes it takes like three or four plus five plus hours right
[23179.94s -> 23184.98s]  i wouldn't i wouldn't say grind i don't think grind is the right word i think the right word is
[23186.23s -> 23193.02s]  go play the game and if you're getting stuck on something there's no reason to continue to suffer
[23194.36s -> 23201.40s]  go play go find a go find a dungeon and just go clear it they're much easier than the actual
[23201.40s -> 23213.08s]  all right so for instance like murk water cave is 100 times easier than fighting market 100 times
[23213.08s -> 23222.57s]  easier another thing i'll give you for a tip because i mean i'm an elden ring streamer right
[23222.57s -> 23226.09s]  i mean i'm an elden ring streamer this is this is what i i'm going to give you advice
[23227.72s -> 23233.64s]  another thing you should take into consideration is you need to start to understand never mind what
[23233.64s -> 23243.35s]  am i going to say you need to understand iframes so what that means is i feel like i'm making the
[23243.35s -> 23249.96s]  spy fucking like ambassador video again and like years later people were like wow dude this is like
[23249.96s -> 23259.62s]  dogshit advice i hope nobody listened to you and i'm like okay that's right you need to learn iframes
[23259.62s -> 23262.82s]  what that means is you are completely invincible your character cannot get hurt
[23263.62s -> 23270.66s]  even a centimeter of your health right now now now some people have these swings where you you're
[23270.66s -> 23276.76s]  you're trying to get hit when you're invincible don't think about getting away i gotta get away
[23276.76s -> 23283.88s]  from this guy no you want to get near that guy you want to when he's swinging you want to get hit
[23283.88s -> 23295.02s]  by the sword when you are invincible get it it's not about getting away it's about getting hit
[23295.02s -> 23302.68s]  when you are invincible and now watch me not do that over and over again but it's this theory
[23303.32s -> 23313.94s]  there's a lot of hairs okay i know that like oh man we're all like man we're all from software
[23313.94s -> 23319.38s]  buds we're all from software fucking chums we i got like 6 000 hours there's a lot of people
[23319.38s -> 23323.78s]  that they literally just got this game for the first time and they have never played a from
[23323.78s -> 23332.14s]  software game ever you know we how about the new players we okay don't you guys understand
[23332.78s -> 23340.01s]  that the more people care about this stuff the more like money that comes in the more that from
[23340.01s -> 23346.62s]  software gets to keep making cool stuff like this think about it right more more companies will make
[23346.62s -> 23354.06s]  games like this it won't just be 5 000 markers on a fucking goddamn open world minimap that is just
[23354.06s -> 23359.26s]  go touch this thing in the world and that's literally it if we get more shit like this the
[23359.26s -> 23366.33s]  more people care about it there's still 500 000 people still playing this except these new players
[23366.33s -> 23372.17s]  they're they'll they let them and it's gonna be hard and the game sucks you're gonna be pissed but
[23372.17s -> 23382.73s]  you'll get it you'll get it eventually you will and you'll feel happy about it where am i okay i
[23382.73s -> 23390.50s]  got it so now let me go in here kind of it kind of changes the design though since they can't afford
[23390.50s -> 23397.93s]  to take as many risks um i i don't know i mean that's what people have been saying i remember
[23397.93s -> 23403.21s]  when dark souls 3 came out and everybody was like oh fuck here we go uh here come the normies
[23403.21s -> 23407.77s]  they're gonna start playing it because it's like a popular thing now and that game kicked my fucking
[23407.77s -> 23414.60s]  ass that was one of the hardest games ever played and then they made sekiro and the same thing oh
[23414.60s -> 23421.88s]  god i saw the trailer here come the normies now it's gonna be ruined sekiro is gonna be fucking
[23421.88s -> 23426.44s]  easy it's gonna be the simplest game ever activision's publishing it it's gonna be
[23426.68s -> 23428.92s]  you're gonna have like you're gonna have like 10 extra lives
[23429.64s -> 23434.57s]  securito was one of the hardest things i've ever done my whole life that was actually the hardest
[23434.57s -> 23440.25s]  game i've ever played it was un-fucking- believably difficult it was unbearable unbearable at times
[23441.37s -> 23448.38s]  and then this came out and now let me before i say anything do i think that this game is harder
[23448.38s -> 23456.94s]  than sekiro no i don't i think this game is as hard as you want it to be because of the open
[23457.02s -> 23464.06s]  world nature of it because you are allowed to go wherever you want sekiro will go down for me as
[23464.06s -> 23471.58s]  probably this i'm talking sekiro will go down that's probably the hardest thing i've ever done
[23472.65s -> 23481.05s]  truly um but this game is i would say you can say it's accessible right but it's only as hard as
[23481.05s -> 23487.74s]  it's only as easy as you're going to make it you can there's no like easy mode right just
[23487.74s -> 23493.42s]  you don't start the game and go oh yeah i'm gonna play on a normal casual experience where you know
[23493.42s -> 23498.78s]  you have a good time and uh the story plays out and no you have to learn how to make the game
[23498.78s -> 23505.10s]  easier the game's not gonna tell you how to make it easier but you can um and if you need to level
[23505.10s -> 23512.22s]  up a few more times and whatever who cares that's not a big deal if you get enjoyment out of you
[23512.22s -> 23517.02s]  know coming here at soul level like 60 or 70 damn that's gonna be fucking hard why are you still
[23517.02s -> 23529.43s]  talking you're stun locked i've been just rambling but what i'm a streamer well i'm literally live
[23529.43s -> 23537.91s]  streaming right now you what i'm not supposed to talk you are i'm literally live streaming right
[23541.88s -> 23548.89s]  fucking style i'd get um but do i think this game could be the hardest one it could be i think the
[23548.89s -> 23554.65s]  bosses though so far have been some of the hardest when you fight them at the you know current like
[23554.65s -> 23561.58s]  on a level that you're supposed to be in quotes but i think this is this is probably the most
[23561.58s -> 23570.06s]  enjoyable of the from software games i truly believe that if you want to play a game that's
[23570.06s -> 23577.26s]  going to literally beat the ever-living fucking shit out of you without any remorse and it's it's
[23577.26s -> 23586.62s]  secure um this game can be that but it doesn't have to be and i know that there's bosses coming
[23586.62s -> 23592.22s]  up here in the next like six to ten hours in the game that people have said oh my god i wanted to
[23592.22s -> 23602.97s]  fucking uninstall the game right we'll see dark souls 2 is the most enjoyable but you get to decide
[23602.97s -> 23617.51s]  that depending on how you play these games secure is still more than 60 is it is it really still
[23617.51s -> 23625.94s]  full price i mean but my long-winded point with this was a lot of people were concerned when these
[23625.94s -> 23634.54s]  games started to become popular and i mean pre-patch for dan should should prove to you
[23634.54s -> 23639.99s]  that that kind of didn't matter and some of the bosses that are in the end of this game that
[23639.99s -> 23646.87s]  i've heard are un-fucking bearable so i still think it has the same charm i still think it
[23646.87s -> 23653.59s]  has the same uh pull i still think it's a very very difficult fun enjoyable interesting experience
[23654.55s -> 23666.12s]  need more balancing in the game i'm concerned about the spirit summons changing the balance for
[23666.12s -> 23677.22s]  non-users yeah but that is kind of hard mode isn't it if you don't use a summon and you're
[23677.22s -> 23683.06s]  you are the game is designed for you to be utilizing that stuff you can make this game
[23683.06s -> 23698.02s]  this game is hard or as easy as you want which is cool okay margit and um and godric back to back
[23698.02s -> 23701.54s]  after having no experience in the game and having not played a from software game in a while
[23702.26s -> 23709.37s]  what is that noise they were really really really hard for me they were very hard they
[23709.37s -> 23716.87s]  were very difficult um but i don't know from there there were summoning signs outside the
[23716.87s -> 23722.31s]  door in the other from software games as well you could summon a person to come help you
[23722.31s -> 23727.35s]  not just co-op like there would be a summoning sign and a lot of bosses in all the other from
[23727.35s -> 23738.55s]  software games so that's kind of the same thing isn't it margit is harder than 90 percent of the
[23738.55s -> 23744.86s]  bosses in this game i kind of think of who i besides radan which radan i thought was insane
[23746.31s -> 23756.84s]  godric was difficult but godric felt fair who hasn't felt i mean renala was all right once you
[23756.84s -> 23766.52s]  okay renala was bad until you figured out like kind of the gimmick behind it summons are way
[23766.52s -> 23772.90s]  tankier than some players ry card is pretty hard well we're about to find that out probably very
[23772.90s -> 23782.84s]  soon people will unironically say these things and still have stacked bugged buffs in the
[23782.84s -> 23788.90s]  fucking game and complain about bosses i mean there's a lot of crazy shit in it but that and
[23788.90s -> 23792.82s]  the point of all these games is they're unbelievably difficult until they're not
[23793.94s -> 23800.74s]  i was tearing my fucking hair out playing against margit and if you put me against margit right now
[23800.74s -> 23806.86s]  i would probably beat him in one or two tries like it's just it's just like i don't understand
[23806.86s -> 23811.58s]  what's happening i keep dying to this this is un-fucking-bearable this game sucks it's too hard
[23812.30s -> 23816.86s]  i would probably beat him first try maybe second try because i just know everything that he does
[23817.82s -> 23829.98s]  that's quite yeah that it's quite a comment your forehead looks sweaty it's because it is very
[23830.70s -> 23845.18s]  very much so wash your face it's it's because there's a piece of hair falling down it makes
[23845.18s -> 23870.06s]  me look like greasy there i fixed it but let me tell you i this game has so much content
[23871.78s -> 23884.18s]  that even okay what are you using as a weapon what even is this thing i get that this game has the
[23884.18s -> 23888.42s]  same amount of content i think is like all the dark souls games in the series have together
[23888.42s -> 23898.44s]  combined in all their dlc it's a little ridiculous all right these travel where does this go
[23899.64s -> 23906.33s]  what's your point my what do you mean what's my point you've i've been making it the whole time
[23906.33s -> 23912.14s]  game somebody said that they're they were they're afraid that this game is too easy or that with
[23912.14s -> 23918.30s]  the popularity comes a uh the game is going to be too easy and so from software is going to keep
[23918.30s -> 23923.02s]  making games and they're going to be simple and my point is that they've proven that that's not the
[23923.02s -> 23929.85s]  case 45 minute explanation it's a goddamn pod just title it podcast about from software okay
[23930.81s -> 23946.55s]  you have pointed ahead that last boss in securo though oh man that was the one of the most
[23946.55s -> 23953.32s]  unbearable experiences i think that took i took it took me like i think 50 to 60 attempts to beat
[23953.32s -> 23961.90s]  that guy and it was pain and suffering that was one of the hardest things i've ever had to do
[23962.62s -> 23978.79s]  he's easier than margit no no not a chance at help not in 100 million years you don't have to
[23978.79s -> 23991.83s]  parry every single move margit does to you you do with that other one all right there was a hold on
[23991.83s -> 23999.88s]  what is up here i had a lot of trouble with the ape yeah that was a that was bad too
[24010.10s -> 24017.29s]  oh what's that some of these bosses are harder than the last boss
[24020.18s -> 24037.34s]  imagine right i'm imagining that's probably the case what also do i think this game is nearly
[24037.34s -> 24042.09s]  as good as what everyone's saying no i think like dark souls 2 is probably better
[24042.81s -> 24051.22s]  dark souls one is probably better mario sunshine is probably better i think this probably sits at
[24051.22s -> 24067.19s]  like um i think the dark souls prepare to die edition on pc i think is a little bit more
[24067.19s -> 24088.86s]  polished than this game is all right i don't want to go that way yet no it's okay trying to take
[24088.86s -> 24104.38s]  my special baby bloodborne away from the number one spot it's gonna be really hard oh i fought
[24104.38s -> 24163.59s]  you on that bridge before i know what you do always the lock on i got it oh i still got it
[24172.68s -> 24286.66s]  oh panic stop panicking stop oh sorry shit what the fuck no i don't have any piano fuck damn it
[24287.46s -> 24300.38s]  oh oh my stamina oh i had it i just like figured oh god damn it i shouldn't have even drank the
[24300.38s -> 24314.02s]  potion i just was panicking because i was like fuck fuck oh it wasn't even greed it was just
[24314.84s -> 24331.59s]  fuck all right where where was that oh damn it i'm so mad oh i had it too oh i'm so frustrated
[24331.59s -> 24343.53s]  at myself why did i even i shouldn't have even drank it i could have killed it other bonfire
[24343.53s -> 24356.42s]  oh yeah the bridge the bridge right right right well i'm kind of fucked here and look now i'm
[24356.42s -> 24374.65s]  gonna get in my head and i'm gonna fucking lose over and over again shit all right which
[24374.65s -> 24391.88s]  bonfire this one here right first try oh the church oh you know now you know what really
[24391.88s -> 24398.01s]  fucked it up it was me doing the weapon art without any mana i just that that was that was
[24398.01s -> 24402.17s]  the big mistake because if i had known that i didn't have any mana if i'd even looked
[24402.73s -> 24416.07s]  i wouldn't have done it and i wouldn't have gotten hit that like third time all right let's do it
[24439.78s -> 24511.70s]  dude please change to your other hand you fucking idiot okay hey oh you can do it too through the
[24511.70s -> 24587.61s]  fucking wall all right stop tilting just fucking play come on fucking stop rolling oh shit oh wrong
[24587.61s -> 24661.72s]  button fuck fuck you the timing on that sucks absolute balls okay god skin stitcher noble
[24661.72s -> 24697.05s]  presence i feel like you made this boss in the sims serpents and what amnion from a womb that
[24697.05s -> 24703.32s]  bore unintended offspring it will never dry out remaining damp indefinitely that's kind of
[24703.32s -> 24726.25s]  disgusting okay just like your forehead shut up leave me alone that was the mcridler all right
[24726.25s -> 24735.34s]  what do we got for time uh all right it's getting late i think i'm gonna call it here about seven
[24735.34s -> 24755.16s]  hours oh i got this too where is it x and strength oh it's that thing okay this is a good time stop
[24756.60s -> 24769.50s]  so i am going to tentatively tell you and handle a full shift um i mean i my elden ring streams have
[24769.50s -> 24775.86s]  been like 10 hours nine to 12 some it's just i haven't been feeling that great so i kind of
[24775.86s -> 24779.62s]  don't want to push it more than like eight plus nine plus hours because i know i will
[24780.58s -> 24787.66s]  so i'm not gonna i've had stomach did you guys know colitis proctitis that shit it's back
[24788.38s -> 24792.78s]  it's flared up and i'm trying to take care of it i have medicine for it it usually takes like a
[24792.78s -> 24798.54s]  week or two sometimes to get rid of it uh to put it back into i guess you'd call it remission
[24800.71s -> 24808.58s]  uh let me i'm not let me clean some stuff up first uh let me see but let me let me see i don't
[24809.54s -> 24815.90s]  it's been pretty much tentative like if i can stream sitting here is really like not great i
[24815.90s -> 24824.02s]  really need to go do stuff with my body uh more than a few times so let me tentatively say
[24824.66s -> 24831.02s]  that the next stream will be on tuesday if i if i get up tomorrow and i'm fine i might just
[24831.02s -> 24840.20s]  stream tomorrow but let me tentatively just say tuesday um there's so much more left in the game
[24840.20s -> 24851.38s]  i can't wait so tuesday so 22nd if i'm filling up to it tomorrow then maybe but let's just say tuesday
[24851.38s -> 24859.56s]  same time around four yeah it's it's annoying but you know sometimes it has to be a thing that's
[24859.56s -> 24875.06s]  dealt with and it usually is dealt with very quickly let me level up first though all right
[24875.06s -> 24879.54s]  endurance is now at 20 that is exactly where i wanted it i don't need to do any more than that
[24879.54s -> 24893.50s]  that's perfect we still have a lot to do here and then there's even more to do here this is this
[24893.50s -> 24901.30s]  game's i just don't even know what to say is there more up here yeah have a great night thanks for
[24901.54s -> 24908.65s]  sticking around i don't these have been going late i know i start late and i go late so i apologize
[24908.65s -> 24913.86s]  if it's like three o'clock two o'clock in the morning for you right now uh but we will continue
[24913.86s -> 24918.82s]  we'll pick it up on tuesday right from here i'm assuming that i gotta go this way and maybe even
[24918.82s -> 24926.46s]  this way and then we're probably gonna get towards like the final finale of the game i would say
[24927.18s -> 24933.85s]  other two or three streams maybe total are you gonna do corn holio on tuesday well it depends
[24933.85s -> 24943.50s]  on if i die like 40 times in the same boss i'm gonna rest here call it there's still a ton more
[24943.50s -> 24951.46s]  left yeah there is there's a lot i'm really looking forward to it are gonna be like four
[24951.46s -> 24964.73s]  streams that's awesome that means i get to play more much love to you thanks for sticking around
[24966.26s -> 24975.45s]  keep an eye on the sus tuesday tentative tuesday the 22nd at four o'clock pacific more elden ring
[24981.51s -> 24986.71s]  we are going to be changing it up a little bit soon because uh ludwig and i are going to be doing
[24987.27s -> 24993.78s]  a stream together on the 29th that should be a fun time it's going to be kind of mayhem but
[24993.78s -> 25001.88s]  it'll be fun i'll probably break up elden ring again this week so if i stream elden ring on tuesday
[25001.88s -> 25009.00s]  then probably you know maybe on wednesday or thursday we'll do something else break it up
[25009.00s -> 25013.85s]  break it up a little bit go back to elden ring on the weekend and then the uh stream with me
[25013.85s -> 25030.94s]  and ludwig house flipper has new dlc well i mean that's i gotta play it right did you do a dos
[25030.94s -> 25039.03s]  night you know that actually is not a bad idea it sounds kind of fun we'll break it up because
[25039.03s -> 25043.22s]  i don't i don't want just every single stream to be elden ring because even for me i gotta break
[25043.22s -> 25065.86s]  it up too it's a no it's not till may oh okay avoid the adult dos games yeah it's been a week
[25065.86s -> 25071.59s]  since you put yeah but i mean the next i'm playing elden ring for at least another seven to eight
[25071.59s -> 25081.59s]  hours on tuesday so there'll be plenty more and i i have essentially committed to completing the
[25081.59s -> 25087.13s]  game on stream so i don't think that's going to be a scenario where that doesn't happen
[25087.13s -> 25103.83s]  eventually can we see auto next time yeah yeah i'll put auto on camera next time
[25104.63s -> 25113.80s]  the progress wise we kind of explored a lot i got through a little bit of the manner here
[25114.52s -> 25125.22s]  it's just so easy to sync just days into this game it's just ridiculous all progress
[25125.22s -> 25134.68s]  is good progress that's right yeah new map too i also want to go back out here i want to do the
[25134.68s -> 25142.14s]  assassination missions and i want to look around that the manner a little more i feel like i kind
[25142.14s -> 25156.01s]  of ran by it all right see you guys on tuesday keep an eye on sus make it to do list yeah i did that
[25156.01s -> 25163.83s]  a few streams ago and it was way way i was way more calculated i knew i knew the three or four
[25163.83s -> 25172.49s]  areas i was going to go on stream and i went there well i'll do that all right good night guys see
[25172.49s -> 25175.53s]  you tuesday take care yourselves bye
