[2107.50s -> 2109.34s]  vigilance
[2109.34s -> 2114.40s]  Of course, all that means nothing when hell's gates start spewing shit everywhere
[2117.56s -> 2123.31s]  All right
[2123.31s -> 2125.31s]  All right, a lot of particle effects
[2127.04s -> 2129.04s]  Again, I will make this statement again
[2129.52s -> 2131.88s]  I want less particle effects not more
[2132.52s -> 2136.62s]  And they're always neon colored
[2138.83s -> 2143.39s]  They're always neon blue neon purple neon green
[2144.11s -> 2146.11s]  They have to be bright neon colored
[2148.19s -> 2151.79s]  It doesn't need to be bloom inside of your particle effects bloom
[2152.97s -> 2155.37s]  I don't I hate the neon particle explosion shit
[2156.33s -> 2164.51s]  It drives me nuts. You didn't see that coming. That was cool for more content
[2164.91s -> 2167.71s]  Here's a new world premiere from perfect worlds new world

[2193.61s -> 2199.13s]  Evidently your sorrows have been working over time. Oh my game. He plays death
[2199.93s -> 2206.17s]  That is truly unprofessional now death. We talked about this try not to lose your temper again
[2213.84s -> 2216.80s]  Maybe it's about time your supporters showed you some respect
[2217.76s -> 2223.84s]  Okay, well you know what they say if you want things done, right it's best to do them yourself, all right
[2225.12s -> 2232.04s]  Oh, yo, this looks pretty great. Actually

[2289.82s -> 2296.94s]  When your medium relies so heavily on being successful in putting the player inside your story audio design is everything
[2297.10s -> 2303.50s]  It's the ultimate hint system an instant mood that either alerts the player to what's coming next or obscures it
[2303.66s -> 2305.26s]  It's basically playing god
[2305.26s -> 2308.38s]  Here are the nominees for best audio design. Oh wait

[2381.56s -> 2386.60s]  The game centers around a heartfelt relationship with a new sonic movie girl and an adorable creature
[2387.68s -> 2391.76s]  I instantly fell in love with the project and it's stunning. Don't call jim carry at 3 a.m

[2852.35s -> 2853.23s]  like I

[4597.96s -> 4603.16s]  Why is now the right time to bring him back? Well, first of all, didn't alan wake get removed from steam?
[4603.48s -> 4606.20s]  It's been raining here in los angeles today
[4607.00s -> 4611.72s]  It's on us like fiction fiction leaking out into reality. So, sorry
[4612.28s -> 4615.56s]  Didn't get removed from steam because they had like copywritten music in it or something over 10 years
[4615.96s -> 4623.24s]  Uh make this streaming of making it we've been iterating on the concept and we know fans have been asking for it
[4623.40s -> 4627.82s]  We've been a bit protective. We knew this is gonna be a pretty scary experience

[4642.66s -> 4644.66s]  survival horror game
[4644.76s -> 4650.84s]  Our take on the genre the first game had horror elements to it, but it was an action game
[4650.92s -> 4655.56s]  I'm actually more interested in this than I was before the perfect genre to bring together
[4655.80s -> 4660.84s]  The story and gameplay closer than ever before because the story horror story
[4661.32s -> 4666.76s]  Is at the very heart of this and it's psychological layered deep mystery to dive into
[4667.16s -> 4672.04s]  I you know, you are actually pretty that's incredible. I'm interested. I can't wait to see what you're doing with this game

[4775.80s -> 4776.60s]  Like the real trailer
[4776.60s -> 4779.80s]  This is a blank dvd for effect if this was the real trailer
[4779.80s -> 4783.80s]  I feel like we were screwed because there's no computer with a dvd drive anymore
[4783.80s -> 4789.72s]  So this would be like troublesome. I've got a 40 blood vitamin d level. We all are about sonic 2 so many

[4834.14s -> 4836.14s]  Where we can really get to know each other
[4836.70s -> 4839.66s]  Hey before you see this exciting new son, he's smoking hot
[4839.74s -> 4845.18s]  I'd like to pass on a word of advice that my scottish grandfather gave to me when I was just a boy. He said son
[4846.14s -> 4848.70s]  Don't grade it in the grinder
[4849.82s -> 4851.83s]  Don't do it son

[4855.19s -> 4858.87s]  Graded trek five confirmed grade it till the cows come home
[4859.59s -> 4862.07s]  But don't grade it and the grinder
[4862.95s -> 4867.51s]  And then to drive the point home he put his hands around my neck and he squeezed real hard and he said

[7757.52s -> 7759.52s]  Why would anybody stream them doing that
[7759.60s -> 7777.02s]  That's right
[7777.02s -> 7782.14s]  Now there's a shitload of other content creators guys that are doing all kinds of cool shit. So don't worry
[7791.57s -> 7793.73s]  Although I would have liked to have seen ludwig on that list
[7795.79s -> 7801.47s]  She's an actor who stars in the mandalorian and the upcoming series the book of boba fett
[7802.03s -> 7804.03s]  Please welcome ming na wen
[7815.17s -> 7821.65s]  Also, some of the vtubers have just exploded in growth and popularity. There's there's so many good creators
[7821.65s -> 7827.66s]  Our own involvement with the story and its characters to be nominated best narrative award
[7828.06s -> 7832.54s]  A great game demands provocative dialogue and a captivating plot
[7832.94s -> 7838.38s]  But above all it must exhibit a meaningful involvement with the audience
[7839.36s -> 7843.44s]  And also just speaking as the mother of a son who loves gaming
[7844.50s -> 7847.46s]  It's nice when there's more to the story than just blowing up
[7847.86s -> 7854.18s]  Grenade factories and shouting obscenities at your alligator brides, what if you won worst creator?
[7854.26s -> 7859.30s]  That would be actually really funny the nominees for best narrative then like then like the crying on camera
[7859.30s -> 7862.50s]  Like I I did a good job this year. Oh, that'd be funny
[7863.94s -> 7869.86s]  Piecing together the puzzle it was a spell. I am telling you if it is a spell
[7870.42s -> 7875.62s]  How do we break it? I need to find out exactly what happened that night. I can reveal their secrets
[7876.50s -> 7881.22s]  You know, I would really like them to do more than one content creator category
[7882.50s -> 7884.18s]  streaming youtube
[7884.18s -> 7886.26s]  Like it's so huge now
[7887.14s -> 7892.26s]  That it's taken over. It's so in the mainstream at this point that I feel like this should be more than like a few categories
[7894.42s -> 7898.74s]  It's hard to recognize everybody when you have one category
[7906.94s -> 7909.18s]  Keep coping. That's what i'm doing
[7919.76s -> 7922.18s]  best narrative wait
[7922.18s -> 7924.18s]  Is this an original narrative?
[7930.46s -> 7933.33s]  a surprise
[7933.33s -> 7938.29s]  There are so many people responsible for making this such a wonderful thing
[7938.29s -> 7942.85s]  I want to thank marvel game studios for trusting us with their characters
[7943.41s -> 7945.73s]  And for allowing us to make them our own
[7946.21s -> 7951.17s]  For our fabulous cast bringing them to life in ways that words on a page can never do
[7951.97s -> 7953.33s]  for olivier
[7953.41s -> 7958.85s]  Does it takes two on there you bear day up my game director the entire crew who worked on it
[7959.41s -> 7961.81s]  And of course my wonderfully wild wacky
[7963.41s -> 7965.41s]  immensely talented writers
[7965.65s -> 7972.85s]  Thank you for making comedy the game is really good. Yeah, I heard that too not complaining too often when I pushed you
[7973.33s -> 7977.33s]  To remember our main themes of grief and to go deeper
[7977.97s -> 7981.47s]  Who am I kidding? I know you complained, but thank you for not doing it to me
[7982.11s -> 7985.15s]  Thank you everyone this is an honor
[7989.34s -> 7995.18s]  I think the the problem that anybody that works on a huge popular franchise license thing
[7996.38s -> 7998.86s]  is even if it is really good you have to fight against the sort of
[7999.50s -> 8005.25s]  Stigma of being the licensed video game. You're already up against a pretty high wall
[8014.91s -> 8016.91s]  But yeah, I heard I actually heard it was pretty good
[8026.37s -> 8028.45s]  I'm not gonna play it but I heard it was good
[8029.17s -> 8030.77s]  I don't play video games
[8030.77s -> 8057.52s]  This kind of reminds me of uh, like wind waker. Can't you float around in wind waker?
[8058.24s -> 8070.94s]  You'd be a bird too
[8070.94s -> 8088.26s]  i'm interested
[8088.26s -> 8102.24s]  That looks cute
[8102.24s -> 8108.88s]  What a beautiful game. All right. Now we have something very special the gameplay world premiere trailer for rocksteady's newest title
[8109.34s -> 8115.76s]  Suicide squad killed the justice league. We've all been waiting anxiously for them to give us a first look at
[8117.36s -> 8120.32s]  It crashed it flipped on your crash they crashed
[8121.28s -> 8122.80s]  Kaylee
[8122.80s -> 8124.80s]  What the hell you think you're doing?
[8126.86s -> 8128.86s]  That footage is strictly classified
[8136.88s -> 8140.61s]  My name is director amanda waller
[8141.70s -> 8146.83s]  Are you my cringe and since the game awards doesn't care about
[8147.37s -> 8155.18s]  Disclosing classified intel listen up. I was being somebody in the audience about task force f
[8155.26s -> 8157.50s]  That wasn't me. There's somebody in the audience
[8157.74s -> 8159.92s]  Justice league or superman
[8160.62s -> 8168.85s]  Rampaging through the streets of metropolis you better not say a word ever to anyone because if you do believe you me
[8169.54s -> 8186.00s]  I'll hear that you've all been brawler out. I was like we don't know who that was
[8186.80s -> 8188.96s]  Does anyone know who that is? She's gone. Good. All right
[8188.96s -> 8193.92s]  Well, I think we've waited long enough to see rocksteady's new game. This is gonna be worth the risk
[8194.16s -> 8195.84s]  You guys want to do it?
[8195.84s -> 8198.98s]  Let's all watch this together
[8199.94s -> 8205.26s]  Think of the justice league I think of wonder woman
[8206.06s -> 8207.42s]  superman
[8207.42s -> 8211.42s]  Green lantern, you don't want to mess with that one, but you
[8212.54s -> 8214.00s]  Barry
[8214.00s -> 8218.88s]  You're just the team mascot. Aren't you mate the loser of the league folks?
[8219.36s -> 8222.16s]  The fastest man alive. It's
[8225.36s -> 8229.01s]  Splash is alive and he's playing for team brainiac
[8229.97s -> 8235.17s]  I gave you orders kill the flash. I'll kill you myself
[8238.13s -> 8240.13s]  I just hope the joker's in
[8266.30s -> 8271.52s]  Why don't you just mail me the bullet i'm the eye in the sky taking point
[8274.85s -> 8278.37s]  Is it like multiplayer or you pick a character I don't know
[8279.17s -> 8309.62s]  Co-op it's a gun type game. Oh, who are you going to main?
[8310.02s -> 8339.65s]  Uh, mr. Furious, uh, either that or the spleen i'm not sure it looks like it could be kind of fun
[8350.02s -> 8355.32s]  Is that just from fear? Oh shit
[8367.54s -> 8377.94s]  I'm probably not gonna play it. You may have met the character I portray in forespoken
[8378.32s -> 8379.36s]  Frey holland
[8379.36s -> 8385.76s]  I am so excited to be here to announce a brand new trailer and especially delighted tonight as we will be seeing
[8385.92s -> 8389.92s]  Pollyanna's first portrayal of tanta prav for the very first time
[8390.56s -> 8396.00s]  She is a ruthless adversary for fray and I hope players get into it looking for a boss fight with this woman at some point
[8397.66s -> 8399.66s]  I definitely hope that you're in a boss fight
[8400.14s -> 8405.10s]  Thank you. Ella. That's so kind even if it is with fray, especially if it if it's with fray
[8407.10s -> 8410.00s]  And now a world premiere trailer for forespoken
[8410.48s -> 8412.88s]  I
[8412.88s -> 8417.12s]  Stop pretending to be interested. You're not going to play any of these games
[8417.36s -> 8420.00s]  You'll be too busy playing like fart simulator
[8421.10s -> 8428.08s]  2013
[8441.56s -> 8448.77s]  The truth really hurts it does it hurts i'll play elden ring, you know, I will
[8457.91s -> 8468.87s]  Hey, dude, you're gonna play destiny pvp tomorrow start banning people that say that for like an hour at least

[8496.48s -> 8502.24s]  Like this is what I could I like i'm gonna have so much trouble stopping streaming eventually

[8541.20s -> 8542.58s]  personal
[8542.66s -> 8544.66s]  Rudge against warhammer 40k
[8546.63s -> 8547.91s]  That's what it is
[8547.91s -> 8552.90s]  When dawn of war 2 came out
[8553.06s -> 8558.18s]  I was so excited because I thought they were gonna eventually put in the tau because the tau is what I played in the original
[8558.18s -> 8560.18s]  dawn of war games, right
[8561.59s -> 8563.59s]  They just don't give a shit about the tau
[8565.40s -> 8567.72s]  I love that. It's they're awesome
[8568.44s -> 8570.44s]  the battle suits the
[8572.12s -> 8575.01s]  I'm a tau player. Yeah
[8575.01s -> 8579.33s]  And they kept putting in this shit that we've already seen a thousand times like dawn of war 3. Let's do in this one
[8579.49s -> 8581.65s]  No tau tau. No, no, no, no, no never again
[8582.53s -> 8597.01s]  Tau is in the game. Yeah, they added tau to the game when the shit had like eight concurrent players on steam
[8601.48s -> 8605.86s]  It took too long
[8605.86s -> 8608.84s]  I love dawn of war. It's like one of my favorite rts franchises
[8610.02s -> 8641.08s]  But i'm very curious what this is space marine 2
[8649.51s -> 8651.43s]  That's that. All right. That's cool
[8651.43s -> 8657.19s]  Put the tau in that game put the tau in this game

[8678.31s -> 8684.65s]  You know, we've uh, we're using the experience that we have we have learned from games like halo quake champions
[8685.27s -> 8690.15s]  World war z to really bring this game to life to make it the most intense action game ever
[8690.55s -> 8693.99s]  And we've got clive as a space marine. It's awesome
[8694.39s -> 8696.87s]  Clive, how does it feel to be in the game? This would be fun. It's a dream
[8697.67s -> 8703.03s]  A pretty bleak and grim dream, but anyone's ever seen any of the work i've done. I'm not scared of the darkness
[8704.23s -> 8706.55s]  No, it's it's i'm stoked and grateful to be a part of this
[8706.87s -> 8710.95s]  I used to play with and paint the space marines when I was a kid with my older brother
[8711.03s -> 8717.35s]  So the chance to play one of the most iconic characters in the warhammer 40k universe is is everything to me

[8893.51s -> 8896.55s]  Like seven games in the whole game. There were like seven maps

[9202.39s -> 9208.15s]  It's filled with action-packed moments behind every door around every corner and I have to play
[9208.71s -> 9216.23s]  A metroid game it introduces us to a massive and mysterious new planet that players can explore and adventure through
[9216.96s -> 9220.00s]  It's the result of a true collaboration between nintendo
[9220.64s -> 9225.52s]  And mercury steam and I have a few comments that the developers asked me to read on their behalf
[9226.56s -> 9231.89s]  We'd like to say a big thank you for this award from the development teams at nintendo and mercury steam

[9319.32s -> 9321.32s]  dude spice wars
[9321.72s -> 9331.52s]  How does that work? You need another edible?
[9333.57s -> 9341.01s]  I I did not do anything of the stars of the upcoming tiny tina's wonderlands ashley birch and will arnett
[9342.05s -> 9345.76s]  What's this gonna be?
[9345.76s -> 9347.68s]  Oh, that's the rheses guy
[9347.68s -> 9350.31s]  That's the rheses guy
[9350.31s -> 9354.71s]  Yeah, there's no wrong way to eat a rheses. Thank you. Ah, don't listen to them eat it wherever you want
[9355.75s -> 9360.53s]  The story in tiny tina's wonderlands. Yeah, and are we talking about the dragon lord yet?
[9361.97s -> 9366.21s]  Yes, will plays the dragon lord the essential villain within the wonderlands
[9366.53s -> 9366.93s]  Yes
[9366.93s -> 9371.65s]  But in a clever twist I turn out to be the underdog hero of the entire realm
[9371.97s -> 9375.65s]  And it's really beautiful and it's actually one of the main reasons that I took this role. So
[9376.45s -> 9378.45s]  So is this like a borderlands game?

[12567.49s -> 12595.84s]  It happened an age ago, but when I recall I see it true on a night of wintry fog
[12596.32s -> 12604.71s]  The rune of death was stolen
[12613.28s -> 12615.28s]  And the demigods began to fall
[12618.58s -> 12620.58s]  Starting with godwin the golden
[12631.06s -> 12633.46s]  Queen marika was driven to the brink
[12646.92s -> 12650.68s]  The shattering ensued a war that wrought only darkness
[12652.36s -> 12654.36s]  The elden ring was broken
[12655.40s -> 12657.40s]  But by whom?
[12657.40s -> 12675.89s]  And why?
[12679.94s -> 12683.22s]  What could the demigods ever hope to win by force?
[12698.92s -> 12705.76s]  The conqueror of the stars general
[12714.85s -> 12723.30s]  And the blade of mickle and milania the seven these two were the mightiest to remain and locked horns in combat
[12727.06s -> 12741.97s]  But there would be no victor
[12750.60s -> 12753.34s]  And so we inhabit a fractured world
[12755.40s -> 12757.40s]  Awaiting the arrival of the elder
[12763.35s -> 12765.35s]  Unless of course

[12884.77s -> 12886.77s]  So that means

[12894.52s -> 12899.48s]  If you're a minority working in video games, when did I start going through life five hours an imposter?
[12900.92s -> 12906.52s]  I think that's what made me wish I had somebody to talk to so I decided to create my own mentorship program
[12907.00s -> 12909.00s]  Maybe i'll play for like an hour
[12909.88s -> 12912.12s]  I don't know. Maybe i'll just come back on what's what's today?

[13160.31s -> 13163.03s]  We'll find out if they are right when we present game of the year

[13224.98s -> 13231.70s]  This is where the brave meets the bold. I was in the bathroom. Somebody said why does this person not talk die in the shadows?
[13233.22s -> 13235.22s]  We will face our fears
[13236.15s -> 13244.13s]  head on
[13244.13s -> 13249.96s]  Showtime

[13362.13s -> 13363.97s]  karyann kiano
[13363.97s -> 13368.77s]  Welcome. I'm sure you guys recognize the iconic scene moment, right?
[13369.73s -> 13373.38s]  Jeff, thank you. It's good to be here at the game awards
[13373.38s -> 13380.42s]  And yes, this is one of the scenes that made the matrix feel so groundbreaking perhaps inspired a few video games, too
[13382.02s -> 13385.99s]  True that's true
[13388.26s -> 13394.20s]  Impressive. Thanks. Can you still do that? Absolutely not but I can in the unreal engine fog
[13395.32s -> 13401.02s]  I believe everyone here is expecting to see something new. So here's a never-before-seen look at the matrix resurrection
[13401.56s -> 13404.14s]  Exclusively for the game awards 2021
[13405.02s -> 13408.54s]  Let's roll the clip him and jim carrey. You have the same energy tonight
[13419.03s -> 13421.46s]  Where are we? Tokyo?
[13421.70s -> 13426.82s]  The moving portal makes I love both of these guys by the way portals clean reading our shadows
[13427.70s -> 13431.82s]  I don't remember this
[13431.82s -> 13433.82s]  We don't have to run to phone booths anymore either
[13434.46s -> 13464.17s]  Doors on your right set and setting right? Oh, no, it's all about set
[13465.05s -> 13470.39s]  And setting after our first contact went so badly. We thought elements from your past
[13471.03s -> 13474.15s]  Might help ease you into the present. Nothing comforts anxiety like
[13475.37s -> 13480.18s]  little nostalgia
[13480.18s -> 13484.66s]  The matrix resurrections looks awesome and we can't wait to watch it on december 22nd
[13484.98s -> 13490.34s]  But getting back to tonight's kind of feel like they got dmca'd midstream kiano. You've been in
[13490.74s -> 13493.54s]  Not you're not watching this movie immersive experiences
[13493.86s -> 13498.26s]  Uh, did you ever think that one day a game could look as real as being in the matrix?
[13499.60s -> 13500.90s]  Absolutely
[13500.90s -> 13505.62s]  I mean we are reaching the point of which the line between the physical and virtual worlds
[13506.34s -> 13508.18s]  are blurry
[13508.18s -> 13514.26s]  And with interactive storytelling reaching stunning levels of fidelity the same exact energy don't even tell me they don't ask
[13514.82s -> 13522.31s]  What is a game? What is a movie over 20 years ago? The matrix pushed the boundaries of filmmaking and visual effects
[13522.79s -> 13527.83s]  We couldn't have imagined where the state of the art would be today was photorealistic digital humans
[13528.31s -> 13530.79s]  In virtual sense in fact if you didn't tell me
[13531.67s -> 13536.31s]  Jim carrey could be dressed up as kiano reeves and kiano reeves could have been like dressed up in makeup as jim carrey
[13539.19s -> 13541.19s]  Just wouldn't didn't tell anybody
[13548.63s -> 13564.54s]  I'm thomas anderson like many of you. I work with computers
[13565.32s -> 13571.00s]  But computers are also mirrors reflecting back who and what we are and the choices we make
[13571.72s -> 13573.72s]  The worlds we build
[13577.03s -> 13579.43s]  You feel got it like riding a bike. Are you serious?
[13591.35s -> 13597.43s]  Oh, it's is it not a game. It's just like it's it's just the the spider-man homecoming vr thing
