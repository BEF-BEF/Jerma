[0.31s -> 18.99s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. Wait a second. Yeah
[19.83s -> 29.90s]  Kick player tanklop. No reason given. Get him out of here. Oh get him out of here booted. Hey, welcome to Facecam Fortress 2
[29.90s -> 36.78s]  My name is Jerma. Welcome to the party. Good to see you. Glad you came. There is a spy standing just right here.
[37.18s -> 39.94s]  Vote failed. I'm currently
[40.10s -> 44.29s]  NACL is my name on here. What the hell is going on?
[44.57s -> 51.17s]  This is just cottage. Playing as the combat engineer, like I said with the frontier justice, the gunslinger and the pistol.
[51.17s -> 53.17s]  Yeah, that's the pistol.
[53.85s -> 61.36s]  See if we can't keep them in their spawn. That would be fantastic. You know what? Let's just put another one down.
[61.84s -> 66.98s]  Get out of the way. Who's gonna? Well, what am I bumping into? Oh my god.
[67.70s -> 69.70s]  Get out of here, man.
[69.86s -> 76.78s]  Spy on top of my spy. Slapping my spy. Anybody? Come on. Come on now.
[77.30s -> 83.06s]  Who wants to come out? Scout wants to come out. You're gonna get riddled with bullets, dude. I told you not to do that.
[83.46s -> 91.33s]  So how about this? Every time I die, I'm gonna chug some Dr. Pepper. We're gonna chug, chug, chug, chug.
[91.57s -> 95.57s]  There's nobody. Is anybody even gonna get out of here?
[98.57s -> 106.50s]  That sniper just went right through my, almost through my face. Yeah, we have them just trapped in here.
[108.82s -> 112.02s]  Get me out of here, please.
[112.26s -> 116.08s]  That guy can't even, like, build me. Like, are you real? Yes, you're real.
[117.95s -> 123.31s]  Uh, where's my dispenser? Where is my dispenser right now? I don't even know where I put it. Oh, it's up there.
[124.98s -> 128.80s]  All right, if by two minutes they do not get out of the spawn,
[129.36s -> 131.44s]  I'm gonna switch teams.
[131.44s -> 133.44s]  See if we can't make something crazy happen.
[138.03s -> 148.30s]  Two minutes. You got until two minutes. Come on now. Somebody come out. Oh, we only got 13 seconds.
[150.27s -> 153.47s]  10, 9, 8, 7,
[154.35s -> 155.39s]  6,
[155.39s -> 156.43s]  5,
[156.43s -> 157.55s]  4,
[157.55s -> 161.47s]  3. Kick this dude again for no reason and
[162.03s -> 163.66s]  time to switch.
[163.66s -> 174.32s]  Can't even switch. I tried. Oh, I died. Yeah. Can I please switch teams?
[174.80s -> 180.54s]  All right, so we got a team scramble. That's what I like to see. Hopefully the teams are a little more fair now.
[181.20s -> 183.92s]  I'm not gonna be able to get this sentry out right away.
[184.56s -> 187.76s]  So let's just go. Hopefully I can put it like one or two back.
[189.74s -> 195.44s]  I remember every time I die, I got to chug Dr. Pepper. That's what happens. That's the that's the punishment.
[195.44s -> 199.65s]  But is it really punishment? I find that to be quite a reward to be honest with you.
[201.06s -> 210.80s]  Let's see if I can't get this in here. Yeah, and this is also right here. Hey, hey, hey, get out of here.
[211.38s -> 214.06s]  Get off my lawn, you rotten kids.
[217.68s -> 224.32s]  Hello. I need the teleporter to be here, facing this way.
[226.58s -> 228.58s]  This is one of my favorite places to put a sentry.
[230.43s -> 236.35s]  Or I like to go up, like there, like up here. But I was a little late as you saw, so
[237.76s -> 243.86s]  let's do it. How's that teleporter built? Let's hope so. You,
[244.93s -> 252.82s]  are you real? I don't think you're real. You're being real. You're acting really odd here. Oh, but that's great.
[253.86s -> 265.60s]  You, come here you. Hey, follow me this way Pyro. I dare you. A double dog dare you. All I see is a sniper's butt.
[266.00s -> 273.28s]  Get your butt out of my face. Level three. Good, good, good.
[274.34s -> 278.51s]  Fantastic. I need to get this. You know what? We're gonna go like this. It's gonna go back here.
[280.80s -> 283.28s]  I know it's probably gonna get taken up by a spy, but you know what?
[285.39s -> 296.67s]  Sometimes you just, what is going on here? Oh, we're good. Get that Pyro. Get him. Get that Pyro, you hear?
[296.99s -> 309.65s]  Scout's going around. What on earth is this guy doing? No, kill him. Nice. Build, build, build, build, build.
[313.09s -> 315.84s]  Get that to level three.
[315.84s -> 322.22s]  Level three's the way I wanna be. Make sure you don't get backstabbed by a
[323.09s -> 325.57s]  spy like this one right here.
[333.70s -> 342.53s]  You. I'm so paranoid. Whenever I play engineer on upward, I get so paranoid because they really could be literally anywhere because it's so hard to play engineer.
[342.61s -> 350.45s]  It's so scary. Take that so no spy can get it. Level three and we gotta, I'll help you with that.
[350.69s -> 358.74s]  Let me help you with that my friend. Let me help you with that. Here we go.
[360.27s -> 363.07s]  And they, I might move this entry in a second here. Whoa.
[367.57s -> 372.45s]  Come on, build it, build it, build it, build it. Come on, build this damn thing.
[373.81s -> 376.53s]  Yeah. Yes. Oh, get it.
[377.17s -> 379.70s]  Get destroyed.
[379.70s -> 384.26s]  Oh, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about right there. Let's pull up some kills here, baby.
[386.77s -> 390.05s]  Nobody can destroy the century of doom.
[397.62s -> 401.17s]  Save my century. Save my century. It's dead.
[402.67s -> 405.38s]  Oh, no.
[405.38s -> 409.66s]  Mortis dur soul stealer. No, they're gonna get it. They're gonna get it.
[409.98s -> 417.63s]  Somebody just, somebody just, spy. Thank you spy. That spy was fantastic. No, don't let him get it.
[417.63s -> 419.63s]  Don't let him get, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[419.95s -> 421.95s]  How did this guy get back here?
[421.95s -> 427.31s]  Wait, oh my god. This, I thought that was three snipers. Don't, don't let it happen.
[428.03s -> 433.62s]  I, I don't care if I have to club somebody in the face. Come on. Come on.
[434.51s -> 436.51s]  They're gonna get it. They're gonna get it. They're gonna get it.
[438.27s -> 442.11s]  No, they aren't. No, they aren't. Use your body. Use everything.
[444.43s -> 450.56s]  No, oh, damn it. God damn it, man.
[451.04s -> 458.93s]  All right, I'm changing up. No, I'm not. Staying engineer. My century's still alive. Where the hell is my century?
[460.67s -> 462.67s]  Where is, oh, my century's right there.
[464.74s -> 467.92s]  Come on, little century. Take him out, little century.
[468.40s -> 472.38s]  Hey, at least if it goes down now, that's okay. I'm okay with that.
[473.46s -> 476.90s]  I'm, I am okay with that because I got nine revenge crits. I'm okay with that.
[477.46s -> 483.17s]  Just gotta get something going here. Me and my suit jacket.
[484.51s -> 487.55s]  Oh, no, no, nothing much. Me and my suit jacket are just having a good time.
[491.87s -> 494.83s]  Three minutes. We can hold them. Three minutes. Hey, hey.
[495.63s -> 500.91s]  You, that's it. You know what? I'm sick and tired of this. I'm just gonna go down here.
[505.49s -> 507.81s]  Who else wants to get crit? Who else wants to get?
[511.28s -> 517.55s]  Soldier. No. Pyro. They're gonna like steam roll now. This is not cool, man.
[517.95s -> 523.10s]  What do I got for pyro? Good enough. Good enough.
[526.50s -> 537.04s]  Just hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Don't let them get over here. I just saw
[537.04s -> 548.51s]  a bastard right there. What are you doing? Oh, get clubbed. And I walk right into that.
[548.51s -> 558.85s]  Are you absolutely? That made up for the second time. Oh, I supposed to drink twice
[558.85s -> 566.56s]  because I died before that as the engineer. I don't even know if I did this or not. I forget.
[566.56s -> 574.13s]  This can is empty. That was a bad idea. Chug. Chug. Chug. Ready? Ready?
[574.85s -> 585.26s]  Come on, everybody. Crit fire. That's the name of the game. Get over here, man. Where's this sniper?
[585.26s -> 597.71s]  Heal me, please. Somebody heal me. Medic, please heal me. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Who wants
[597.71s -> 605.94s]  it? Who wants this? Oh, you want this medic? You. You want this? This is what you want? This is what
[605.94s -> 615.58s]  you want? Oh, whatever. Just get him. Just shoot him. Oh, I'm like burping every eight seconds.
[616.77s -> 621.81s]  Get rid of that. Get rid of that. What the hell is going on? Did you see how long that just took?
[621.81s -> 632.78s]  What was that all about? I got nothing to drink. Dude, I was holding. What is my ping? Why can I
[632.78s -> 640.03s]  don't? Why is tab not working? All right, whatever. I was holding the button down on that mini sentry
[640.03s -> 648.03s]  for like way too long. It's all right. We got this. This is going to be a GG if I do say so myself.
[650.38s -> 659.89s]  Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. Get off of this. Get out of here. Oh, it was
[659.89s -> 668.91s]  worth it. It was worth it. No, they're going to cap it. Oh my god. Get him off that. Get him off it.
[668.91s -> 683.65s]  Get him off it. Come on, man. Come on, man. Three, two, one second. Yeah. Nice job, guys. Nice job.
[683.65s -> 689.94s]  You did a fine job tossing your little balls around. So that's going to wrap it up here,
[689.94s -> 694.51s]  guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time.
[694.51s -> 699.97s]  And of course, the strongest man in the world. Take care, everybody.
