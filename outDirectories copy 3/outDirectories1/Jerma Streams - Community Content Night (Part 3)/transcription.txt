[0.63s -> 9.62s]  Hello everybody. How are you? Good afternoon. Scam train level 5. Oh wait,
[9.62s -> 13.80s]  Poland. Can I do it right now? I'm gonna do it right now. I'm gonna change it right now.
[13.80s -> 24.84s]  I forgot to do that. I, yeah. Let me change that right now. Okay. Settings. Uh, okay. Preferences.
[25.72s -> 32.49s]  Okay. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Hype train. There it is. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[33.13s -> 44.41s]  Hard. Make it really hard. And make it 15 events. Done. Okay. Now it's, now it's very hard to do.
[44.41s -> 55.72s]  I just did it right now. Okay. Good. Now I just made it too hard. And now he's, he's, he's just
[55.72s -> 64.44s]  starting to scam everybody. Oh no. Now we're never gonna get a scam train. All right. But anyways,
[64.44s -> 73.82s]  how you guys doing? Welcome back. Uh, my voice is a little gone today. And I just figured out why.
[74.14s -> 81.42s]  And I remember the exact moment from yesterday that it happened. Um, if you remember during a
[81.42s -> 86.06s]  portion of the stream yesterday, I did this thing where I screamed without screaming.
[88.20s -> 93.00s]  I screamed very loudly, but I didn't scream. I cut it off halfway through and then I came back
[93.00s -> 100.98s]  and screamed louder. Um, that's what did it. And that's why I sound like this today and last night
[100.98s -> 108.46s]  too. Oh, there's only a limited time to earn. There's only a limited time to earn exclusive
[108.46s -> 116.12s]  e-boats. How hard is it now? Isn't it? It's harder to do this. I made this harder to do.
[116.92s -> 126.20s]  And I increased the amount of events that it takes. Everybody get your hands in the air.
[126.20s -> 136.46s]  Everybody, everybody hands in the air. Hands up. Everybody here comes up. I'm just a Skype train.
[138.04s -> 145.08s]  Like we're all going to get on Skype. Level one completed. Excellent work everybody. You did it.
[145.08s -> 154.31s]  You got us to level one Skype train. Is it actually harder to do though?
[155.11s -> 160.30s]  You're going to have to increase it a little more. What do we got? Hold on.
[160.94s -> 166.89s]  Hype conductors. Hold on. Here are your current hype train conductors.
[167.85s -> 185.51s]  You boy, pity. This is pay to win. Look at that. That greedy grinner is definitely grinning right
[185.51s -> 190.47s]  now. But we're going to do a community content night. And I know I say night, but it's day.
[191.03s -> 196.07s]  But that sounds like shit. Community content night rolls off the tongue better than community
[196.07s -> 202.98s]  content day. Oh, community content day. Now community content night. That sounds better to me.
[202.98s -> 206.58s]  Oh, I don't care if it's 11 o'clock in the morning. It's going to be called community
[206.66s -> 215.94s]  content night or let's call it EU night. But because we didn't do one last month,
[217.64s -> 225.30s]  I had to break it up because I didn't want to get sort of community content exhaustion.
[226.02s -> 229.38s]  And I'd want to spend time on people's submissions. I want to look at them and talk
[229.38s -> 235.70s]  about them. And obviously I have enough time on them. I don't want to just dump like 500
[235.70s -> 239.86s]  images on the screen and go, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So we're going to do,
[240.50s -> 247.96s]  we're going to break it up into two. We're going to do two, one right now, and then one next weekend,
[247.96s -> 253.72s]  which the one next weekend will catch us up over the last like 25 days or so, 30 days.
[255.24s -> 262.41s]  What you're seeing here is stuff from November, from November into December. And there's some good
[262.41s -> 277.24s]  shit here. I've seen, oh, we got a hype train level two completed. Where's my lip balm? I don't
[277.24s -> 288.63s]  even have any lip balm up here. What a mistake. It never gets old. I pray, but on the lipstick.
[288.63s -> 295.30s]  No, I need lip balm. I really do. If I don't have lip balm, then get hype, get hype, hype.
[296.18s -> 306.04s]  It's just that it's the bar. I figured it out. If anytime that there is a completable bar,
[306.76s -> 315.00s]  somebody will do it. Always. It doesn't matter what it is. As long as there is a progress bar,
[315.00s -> 323.13s]  it's going to be filled. But I see this. I'm thinking about just contributing to make the
[323.13s -> 334.73s]  progress go up. I have to see the bar go up. We're just a bunch of mice. We're just a bunch of rats.
[336.81s -> 355.56s]  Like, bar go up. Yeah, eat. You owe Lord of the Rings subs. Oh, fuck. I actually do. I actually
[355.56s -> 364.97s]  do. I actually really do. Oh, how many? Look, I don't even remember. I remember like 15 minutes
[364.97s -> 374.46s]  of that 13 hour stream. How many subs do I owe? It was 40. Okay. All right. All right. All right.
[374.46s -> 380.70s]  Hey, I got to make this progress go up. All right. Hold on. Hold on. No, that's true. That is
[380.70s -> 398.60s]  absolutely true. Hold on a second. Yeah, because I said if I swung one time that I owed 10 subs and
[398.60s -> 405.10s]  I swung like three or four times. All right. Okay. Well, here we go. Let me gift subs.
[405.10s -> 415.30s]  Give gift subscriptions. Give. Can I give more? Okay. I have to do. All right. Here we go. 40.
[417.30s -> 431.42s]  $200. Now, here we go. Here comes 40 community subs. Okay. My mother does this thing. It doesn't
[431.42s -> 438.46s]  matter how inexpensive or how expensive something is. When she hears the price for it, she repeats
[438.46s -> 446.25s]  the price shocked and annoyed. How much is that? How much is that slice of pizza? Well, it's, um,
[447.21s -> 456.81s]  it's $2.80. $2.80. Jeremy. Yeah, it is. Oh, my goodness. That better be the best pizza I've ever
[456.81s -> 468.87s]  had in my life. Same reaction. If that pizza was $200 a slice, it would be the same reaction.
[469.59s -> 479.21s]  All right. Let me let's do this. Here we go. 40 community subs. I am a man of my word sometimes.
[480.25s -> 491.94s]  I'm making my own hype train go up. Wait, that doesn't count. Hey, hey, that doesn't. How come
[491.94s -> 499.82s]  that doesn't count? I can't increase my own. Hold on. So you can't just sit there and make your own
[499.82s -> 513.29s]  hype train go up. Oh, maybe you should try it again. Should I try it again? Wait, I ran out
[513.29s -> 517.77s]  of time. No, I didn't. There's still three minutes and 40 seconds left. All right. Let's get this
[517.77s -> 521.69s]  started. Community content night. Uh, this is going to be short stream. Probably going to be
[521.69s -> 527.48s]  a couple hours, few hours. It's going to be a quick one. We're just going to chill,
[527.48s -> 535.30s]  go over some videos, go over some artwork. And I do have something to tell you though,
[535.30s -> 540.98s]  something that you'll like. But for those of you that, uh, well, for those of you that think that
[540.98s -> 546.26s]  when Joel is on a stream, it's the worst stream ever. Uh, apparently, you know, the two streams
[546.26s -> 550.82s]  that we've done together, uh, the first one was nominated for worst stream of the year. Uh, and
[550.82s -> 553.94s]  the second one was nominated for best stream of the year because I nominated it for this year
[553.94s -> 562.65s]  because I loved it. Tuesday on Tuesday, we're going to do keep talking. Nobody explodes this
[562.65s -> 568.95s]  time. We're going to switch off. We're going to do a little longer this time and we'll switch off.
[568.95s -> 581.14s]  Uh, keep talking and nobody explodes part two on Tuesday. Just got the confirmation. Jesus Christ.
[582.74s -> 591.06s]  Hype train has been completed because, uh, not to be, uh, over not to be overshadowed by my 40
[591.06s -> 597.62s]  community subs, but it's just me. That's all right. Here's the, hold on. All right. Listen,
[598.42s -> 606.36s]  50 community subs just came in from Zyxia. 50. All right. That's right. That's five zero,
[606.36s -> 612.28s]  50 fucking subs. Everybody, every concurrent viewer is potentially going to be subscribed
[612.28s -> 618.07s]  to this channel. It's at some point, if you stick around for long enough and you do, and you come
[618.15s -> 623.11s]  to most streams, you're going to get a subscription. If this shit just is, this is out of control,
[623.99s -> 632.76s]  right? Like I mean, mathematically, how much longer can they be like two to 300 community
[632.76s -> 643.48s]  subs every stream? Like, see, you know, I see them saying to say, this is a 69, 69 subs from
[643.48s -> 656.63s]  phylactery. Jesus, guys. Oh my God. And they give the, they give the 69 number every time.
[656.63s -> 662.04s]  Level five completely gets over. We did it and I made it harder. All right. I'm going to make
[662.04s -> 672.12s]  this impossible next time. I guess I could just like, I guess I could just like turn it off.
[672.92s -> 683.22s]  Right. Anyways, but, but that's huge fucking money from both you guys. Thanks for the 50 Zyxia
[683.22s -> 690.60s]  and 69 community subs from phylactery. But what I was saying is all, whenever,
[691.24s -> 694.68s]  whatever somebody, whatever a streamer gives community subs to their own stream,
[695.64s -> 703.82s]  they're just deleting a percentage of money. You know what I mean? It's just like, here you go guys.
[703.82s -> 713.62s]  Here's 50 community subs. I just, I just deleted money. It's just gone. That's like, that's like,
[713.62s -> 717.30s]  that's like throwing like pennies away. You know what I mean? Like don't do that. Don't, don't throw
[717.30s -> 733.66s]  like a nickel in the trash. What the hell are you doing? You're crashing the economy. You're just
[733.74s -> 739.90s]  paying Twitch. Yeah. I just said that paying Twitch money was throwing money in the trash.
[741.40s -> 746.17s]  Oh, that was probably not the best choice of words.
[752.02s -> 757.06s]  Ladies and gentlemen, twitch.tv. If you want to hang out and have fun, remember I'm a streamer
[757.06s -> 762.74s]  here. I love this. This is a great platform to exist and you know, it's everything and it's also
[762.74s -> 768.57s]  nothing. Twitch, hang up for a while. That's all right. I just did that. I'm fine. I literally
[768.57s -> 778.66s]  absolved from all crimes at this point. Yeah, I did. I'm good. Anyways, all right. Let's get
[778.66s -> 783.70s]  started. We're going to play Stardew Valley OST. We're going to go over community content art.
[784.26s -> 802.86s]  So why don't we do that? Isn't it beautiful? Let's get it on screen. I'm going to just start with
[802.86s -> 810.89s]  artwork first. That's what we've been doing. This is the third time we've done it. I'm in the wrong
[810.89s -> 822.54s]  position. This is probably not the best music for the image that's completely, that's on the screen
[822.54s -> 831.61s]  right now. Is that guy naked? All right. That was, that was a good one. Oh, Stardew Valley.
[831.61s -> 848.26s]  Here's Saturn eating his children. Okay. What do you mean bottom right? You just freaked me the
[848.26s -> 853.43s]  fuck out. I thought there was something on this image that I didn't see. Don't shout this person
[853.43s -> 859.50s]  out. Why? I mean, it's down in the corner. All right, coming up. This is another doodles from
[859.50s -> 866.20s]  Core Monster. Please, if you submit art or anything, get your, get your, get your shit on the
[866.20s -> 871.24s]  bottom. You know what I mean? So we can know. So it's not just me. So it's not just me sitting in a
[871.24s -> 880.81s]  chair, taking what you've created and going, yeah, that's, that's good. Me. Nice. Hey, we succeeded on
[880.81s -> 899.08s]  the, I'm okay. Thanks for the, uh, 238 subs and the 7,200 and fucking like a hundred dollars in this.
[900.28s -> 909.54s]  Here come the emails. Free Skype account. Anyways, this is cool. Uh, this is, looks like some doodles,
[909.54s -> 920.74s]  which are always cute and interesting. It's literally $700. I know it's a lot of money.
[920.74s -> 933.82s]  I just want, I know it's a lot. There's plans though for that money going directly in a circle.
[933.82s -> 938.14s]  And it is just wandering because I'm just going to put it back into, into the Twitch stream.
[939.10s -> 947.59s]  Oh, it is going to Twitch, right? So if I get a hundred dollars and I put like $80 back into the
[947.59s -> 962.65s]  stream. Fuck! Here's another one from Cora Monster. Stalks her in a tumble. Ah, Cora, this is the
[962.65s -> 970.17s]  number one, Bia? Is this supposed to be the first Bia? Oh wait, no, that's Bugleberry. Is it Bugleberry?
[972.60s -> 986.57s]  Oh, is that Bugleberry's urns? I don't even know my own lore. Bia-berry. Bullshit. I wish I could do
[986.57s -> 996.23s]  even 5% of this, by the way. If I could even do 10% of just doodles like this, I, this is,
[997.50s -> 1002.38s]  I would have drawn the like tiger eating the guy dream. You know what I mean? I would draw
[1003.10s -> 1009.02s]  so much shit. I would, there was so many random creatures and monsters up here that I just,
[1009.02s -> 1014.22s]  I would be drawing. I wish I could. No, I can't. I cannot learn. I cannot learn. It's no one. No,
[1014.22s -> 1019.98s]  I cannot. No, I cannot. I went to school for this. I paid money to an institution to learn how to do
[1019.98s -> 1036.25s]  this and I'm un, not teachable. I learned. I'm just too, I hold a pen, I hold a pencil like this,
[1036.25s -> 1046.25s]  guys. You know, I, I can't learn how to draw. I can't do it. And I know my limitations and my
[1046.25s -> 1054.30s]  limitations are, okay, here we are. This is what I'm incapable of as a person. Funny voices, noises.
[1055.10s -> 1063.90s]  That's it. That's all I'm gonna do. You know, we've got like noises. For instance, like you've
[1063.90s -> 1068.63s]  probably never heard anybody be able to go like this before. Like who can, who can do that that
[1068.63s -> 1083.22s]  you know? How about this one? How about that? I never get embarrassed on stream, but that just
[1083.22s -> 1089.91s]  did it for me. I don't know why. Cause I saw the, I can see the preview over here. You got, see the
[1089.91s -> 1098.81s]  chat is right here, right there. You guys are right there on this monitor. And then my webcam
[1098.81s -> 1105.75s]  and my preview is right there. So I look over at what you guys are saying and then I, who's that
[1105.83s -> 1109.99s]  fucking weirdo? You know what I mean? Like for instance, I'm looking at you guys right now.
[1110.63s -> 1115.43s]  Who's this guy? And I fucking don't like him. I can't put, this is why I don't do webcam.
[1116.15s -> 1122.39s]  Like I'm too distractible. I'm distracted by my own face. This is what happens to me in the mirror.
[1122.39s -> 1127.72s]  I'm not kidding. When I get out of the shower, I'm just like, I'm like, what are those, what are
[1127.72s -> 1135.53s]  those fishes that if they see themselves in a mirror, they get like angry? What is it called?
[1136.09s -> 1154.57s]  The beta. You know, if like your cat sees itself in the mirror and it's just like,
[1155.45s -> 1178.58s]  like that's what I, that's what I do every day. I'm like an animal that sees another like animal
[1178.58s -> 1192.90s]  in the mirror and thinks it's another animal, but it's just me. I just greased up. I told you,
[1192.90s -> 1197.62s]  I'm not lying. I told you guys didn't think I was mad at a sludge. You guys didn't think I was made
[1197.62s -> 1203.91s]  at a fucking sludge. Nobody believes me. Nobody believes me. Do you believe me now? Do you believe
[1203.91s -> 1213.00s]  me now? You believe me now, huh? What's he talking about? He said like he keeps slipping
[1213.00s -> 1220.04s]  his finger off off the A button when he's playing this game. Oh, I just touched this and slimed you
[1220.04s -> 1230.98s]  guys community content, but we celebrate all the wonderful things that people in this community
[1230.98s -> 1240.47s]  create talking about you. We're not talking about Jeremy being a cat or fish or a dog that sees
[1240.47s -> 1252.54s]  itself in the mirror and thinks it's another dog and freaks out. Um, very good work. Very good
[1252.54s -> 1265.38s]  stuff. These are a couple of thumbnails from the second channel. Might as well show them. They're
[1265.38s -> 1273.59s]  fantastic. Although do they have it in there? I think these are all by the same artist, by the way.
[1273.59s -> 1285.54s]  I love this. This image is fantastic. I think this is actually from the game itself. That's so good.
[1285.54s -> 1300.07s]  I know it is. It's so good. God, don't you like wish you were Spider-Man sometimes? I love how
[1300.07s -> 1311.62s]  it's just done. I love how just done with me Spider-Man is in these images. This is like what
[1311.62s -> 1319.46s]  it's like when you live in a city and somebody comes to visit and you take them around for a
[1319.46s -> 1332.06s]  tour. And this may have been like the like the 500th person that has done this and they're like,
[1332.78s -> 1344.23s]  and you're like, yeah, I've trained. This shit is real. This is this everything. It's all connected.
[1345.19s -> 1349.50s]  All connected. We need variety. We need different things to happen.
[1352.06s -> 1358.31s]  Me too. I'm talking about like the same thing happens. Those of you that weren't here. I'm
[1358.31s -> 1363.91s]  talking about the Han Solo wires in the ride at Disneyland. Some of you might not remember
[1363.91s -> 1370.18s]  this and maybe you weren't here, but I can't even explain it. Anybody get anything I'm saying? I
[1370.18s -> 1376.55s]  gotta be very clear. Does anybody get this? I mean even like three people. Does anybody get this?
[1378.04s -> 1384.89s]  Nobody can remember this? This is like the same thing as the Han Solo ride 50 times in a row.
[1385.45s -> 1400.60s]  Because I mean I need to like review this VOD and like bring it to the doctor. Hey, oh yeah,
[1400.60s -> 1405.67s]  it's like I got my physical covered up. Doc, what do you think about this? Can you just like go over
[1405.67s -> 1411.59s]  this footage for a little while with me? Can you just watch this VOD and then like then help me
[1411.59s -> 1432.57s]  here? This is a dream you had. This is from VR. It's multi trip. Nice work. I have this.
[1433.77s -> 1441.67s]  Yeah, this is the acid sludge. My body's just made out of it. Isn't there a superhero or a
[1441.67s -> 1452.17s]  supervillain or something that has like acid like ability? Probably me. Remember this manga sucks.
[1452.17s -> 1459.40s]  This is a fantastic image. How dare you say something so ridiculous? This is fucking awesome.
[1460.79s -> 1473.80s]  Oh, you're referring to the story. The story. I get it. This is great work, Bill. Here are some
[1473.80s -> 1478.92s]  doodles of the rat movie characters. Getting a little closer actually so you can see it better.
[1480.76s -> 1484.04s]  We've got, I don't think about this game. I don't know who these characters are
[1484.68s -> 1489.08s]  in the game. Like their actual names. They actually, the characters in 3D Movie Maker
[1489.08s -> 1500.25s]  have real names and they're wild. I used to know them all. Like Dick Dastardly Richard,
[1500.25s -> 1505.21s]  that's his name in the game is not that. It's like, it's like Gregory. I'm like,
[1505.21s -> 1512.90s]  we need that lore. Well, his name is Dick Dastardly Richard. Well, it's been amended, sure.
[1516.66s -> 1522.98s]  No, no, no. I'm saying like not in the lore, this character's name is not Gregory. His name is
[1522.98s -> 1537.45s]  Richard. The actor's name. Yes. But I like, I like this one. I like this one. I love the super
[1537.45s -> 1549.94s]  expressive artwork that people do. Although, it would be credited as Gregory. I like cartoon,
[1549.94s -> 1557.85s]  almost Looney Tunes style of overexpression in style. I love it. I wish I was capable of it.
[1557.85s -> 1569.24s]  That was a rumor, yeah. Let's zoom back out. Here are some more doodles. Get it all.
[1570.04s -> 1584.82s]  Get it all. Is that mustache hair? I can't help it. This is just how I look. You know what I mean?
[1586.70s -> 1594.65s]  Like, if you tell me to smile for a camera, like I just have like a goblin face. Like I can't help
[1594.65s -> 1602.55s]  it. I can't help that. I've tried. I, cause I can't smile. Smiling normally for me is just like,
[1604.55s -> 1612.47s]  I can't, I just, I can't do it. Like in a picture, me going like, no, I can't do it. I feel like too
[1612.47s -> 1621.26s]  fucked up trying to do it. Like, no, I can't. I feel like I'm just, I'm pretending. So I always
[1621.26s -> 1631.05s]  just do this in a picture. I always just go like, which that's fine. I can't do a big wide animated
[1631.05s -> 1636.17s]  like smile because I just feel like, cause every time the picture is taken, like for instance,
[1636.17s -> 1648.78s]  like take it, take the picture. Like, like I'm the fucking psycho in that image. That there's not a
[1648.78s -> 1666.41s]  good look reaction. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I'm doing it now. Like that cartoon villain. Oh, this is
[1666.41s -> 1672.22s]  great though. I like this. I like the, you got a lot of the, you got a lot of the nuances here.
[1673.02s -> 1678.17s]  This is over here. This is over here. Very good. But do we already have it?
[1678.89s -> 1695.82s]  Hold on. You already got it. Right. Okay. So hear me out on this. So this image, this image
[1697.62s -> 1712.17s]  is, that's how I look in pictures. Like that's the, that's the type of image where like you're,
[1712.17s -> 1717.61s]  you're on like vacation somewhere and the person's taking the photo. There's like three or four of
[1717.61s -> 1723.61s]  you in this photo. I'm one of them. And that's the face you make while the deep in the distance,
[1723.61s -> 1729.05s]  you're smiling and like the volcano back there is erupting. And you, that's you, that's the in
[1729.05s -> 1736.41s]  between from, I'm smiling and happy to, there's a disaster over there. And it's boom, right there,
[1736.41s -> 1749.51s]  right at that moment. I'm like that in every photo. Ask Kim. When we go out and we're like,
[1749.51s -> 1754.87s]  oh, let's take a, let's take like a selfie together. Kim will take a photo and it's just like,
[1755.99s -> 1758.95s]  she's like, no, no, no, not that one. Let's do it again. And I'm like, okay.
[1760.89s -> 1765.61s]  No, no, no, that one's no, no, no, you can't. And then I'm like, all right, let's, let me do it.
[1765.61s -> 1768.25s]  Let me do it. And I take, I take the photo and I'm just, I take the camera and I'm like,
[1768.97s -> 1772.33s]  I try to get it in the right spot. I took for me to take the photo because I know when I'm
[1772.33s -> 1781.66s]  going to press the button. Right. And then I just do, I end up doing this. That's real life. Go to
[1781.66s -> 1795.53s]  every picture I've ever been in. I, that face every time. Just telling you facts here. I put it all on
[1795.53s -> 1805.88s]  the table. You know, what do I care? Thermal bloat. All right. We can, let's get back to community
[1805.88s -> 1818.52s]  content. God's sake. What an egomaniac. Egomaniac is like airing out his insecurities. Isn't that
[1818.52s -> 1824.97s]  like the opposite of an egomaniac? Oh, what an egomaniac. He's like telling us about his insecurities
[1825.77s -> 1835.38s]  and he's like, he's showing us his real side. It is. Is it? Hold on. If I tell you, hey, I don't,
[1835.38s -> 1839.46s]  I don't like the way that I look in photos. I do the same thing in photos. I look, I don't like the
[1839.62s -> 1847.22s]  way I look strange. Wouldn't an egomaniac be like, I look good in every fucking picture. I am so
[1847.22s -> 1852.58s]  handsome. I'm the most handsome person that you've ever met. Isn't that what egomaniac is?
[1855.54s -> 1880.34s]  You're talking about yourself. We've seen this. We saw this before. It's stuck into the last one.
[1880.98s -> 1894.78s]  Look at that big brain up there. Look at this huge brain that's up there.
[1895.74s -> 1916.22s]  So bad. So bad. Idiot. Bald. Oh my God. Malding. Sour Please. Bold. A YouTube link. Now that's
[1917.18s -> 1923.58s]  completely accurate. It's just a YouTube link. Steve, follow me. LOL. What's going on?
[1924.46s -> 1940.78s]  This is fantastic. This is by SnoozingCopter. What's going on in this stream? Idiot. Bald. Bald.
[1943.06s -> 1948.98s]  No, this is good shit. I love this. Even got this. I mean, typically the camera would be this way,
[1950.02s -> 1961.69s]  but even got the foam to work. Oh, I sort of flipped this, but just go like this.
[1963.64s -> 1993.40s]  But actually I can do it right now. That's too much. Not quite wrong. Can you tell I'm new
[1993.40s -> 2012.06s]  at this? It's good. Actually, I actually like it like this. I think it's better like this because
[2012.06s -> 2016.78s]  the wine is pouring upside down. The wine is now the number one thing that you want to look at in
[2016.78s -> 2023.42s]  the image. You know what I'm saying? And then this is like his arm flowing down. I actually
[2023.42s -> 2037.99s]  like it like this. I'm serious. Wine actually is the front and center. Why are you drinking
[2037.99s -> 2052.26s]  wine out of a beer glass? This is completely judgment free zone here because I drink whatever
[2052.26s -> 2058.94s]  I want to drink out of any cup that I can get. Oh, you have to drink wine out of a wine glass. Why?
[2058.94s -> 2067.14s]  Why can't I drink wine out of a Pac-Man cup? Who cares? It's just a cup. It just holds the
[2067.14s -> 2079.43s]  thing that you then put in your stomach. Who cares? Because why? So you guys can look good
[2079.43s -> 2091.67s]  in a picture? I don't care about that shit. You know, I don't fucking care. This is great,
[2091.67s -> 2105.05s]  though. Seriously, thank you. I'm on a carnival. I got a good Clint Eastwood face going here.
[2106.57s -> 2116.65s]  This is the Wailord. Wailord is currently downstairs. Wailord has become another bed
[2116.65s -> 2123.58s]  for Otto to sleep on. Otto has been climbing on top of it and just laying on it and getting
[2123.58s -> 2137.46s]  comfortable on it. Wailord is now Otto bed number three or four. Get a picture of that?
[2139.24s -> 2145.56s]  Okay, I'll tell Kim the next time that she sees him doing it. Here's the thing. My camera sucks.
[2146.28s -> 2150.76s]  I hate taking photos with my iPhone because the camera looks like somebody spit on the lens.
[2153.02s -> 2164.28s]  Get a real phone. I want, no, I'm waiting until somebody releases a small phone. I want the SE,
[2165.16s -> 2169.32s]  but Apple decided that they were going to just kill the SE, not sell it anymore,
[2170.82s -> 2176.52s]  and make every phone three times bigger. I don't want a big phone. I want a small,
[2177.74s -> 2185.66s]  very easy to hold, thin, small phone. I don't want huge phones. I just looked over here and got
[2185.66s -> 2202.14s]  scared. Like, it just freaks me the fuck out for a second. Here, this is on the other monitor right
[2202.14s -> 2211.88s]  now. Get that off. I want a small phone. Carnival was one of the most fun times I ever had on stream,
[2211.88s -> 2216.58s]  and I loved it, and I'm happy that people thought it was fun. There's another image.
[2216.58s -> 2231.08s]  Well, we're doing community content tonight. Derma of the future. Derma of the past is probably
[2231.08s -> 2247.37s]  more accurate. Derma of the past. Gotta be young again. Derma of the future. Derma of the future
[2247.37s -> 2254.06s]  is gonna be walking around with a cane. Just like, I'm gonna be leaned over, hunched over.
[2254.94s -> 2262.38s]  Yeah, make this Derma of the, race that to make a Derma of the past, and to get swole again. I don't
[2262.38s -> 2270.23s]  think I could ever do it again, and look at this shirt. I used to wear those tank tops. I still do.
[2275.96s -> 2284.63s]  Gym stream. No, I understand now why you drive by all those old people, old ladies and old men,
[2284.63s -> 2288.47s]  that are just going like this when they walk down on the street. They just go for a walk,
[2288.47s -> 2290.63s]  and you're like, what are they doing on there? And they're just going like this.
[2293.70s -> 2298.84s]  I never understood why they were doing this. I didn't get it. Like, why are you doing that?
[2298.84s -> 2301.96s]  But you did, you're just, they're just moving around. They're just getting their arms and
[2301.96s -> 2305.24s]  their muscles and their blood flowing, and then they go home. That's what I'm gonna do.
[2305.96s -> 2325.91s]  I aspire to be that now. Rue crew in public. No, that's, what? Oh, okay, I get it. I get it.
[2325.91s -> 2332.06s]  That's, but this is good. Thank you. It's good shit. That's how I used to look. Man, I was
[2335.99s -> 2352.58s]  riding cheesy. Riding cheesy from Ike. Thank you, Ike. I like the nose. Very cute. Riding cheesy.
[2354.71s -> 2362.44s]  No helmet. Well, we don't know, we don't know that he's operating the vehicle.
[2363.24s -> 2369.18s]  He could be sitting still. He could be at a parking lot. We don't know that this is being
[2369.18s -> 2380.04s]  operated. By the way, it's not real. This is not really happening. Wait, somebody get a helmet on
[2380.04s -> 2397.86s]  him. This is an image of a cartoon character. What? This is actually pretty interesting
[2397.86s -> 2405.94s]  considering you go, oh, was that just the giant rat? Well, it is. But from the post, this person
[2405.94s -> 2416.23s]  has imported the giant rat into Source Filmmaker. And I have the link for that right here. This
[2416.23s -> 2422.87s]  apparently is the Source Filmmaker files for the, that giant rat. I don't know how you,
[2422.87s -> 2432.71s]  I don't even know how that was impossible. So I wonder how you did that. He must have had to
[2432.71s -> 2444.06s]  just model it, right? And then import it in. Rat movie three in Source Filmmaker. I just ripped
[2444.06s -> 2452.14s]  the model and ported it into Blender and ported it. That's fucking cool. That's awesome. I didn't
[2452.14s -> 2455.74s]  even know that, I thought they were made out of like bitmap images. I didn't even know it was real
[2455.74s -> 2460.94s]  3D. I thought it was just like fake 3D or something. That's, I guess it can kind of have to be,
[2460.94s -> 2471.14s]  right? I thought it was just like bitmap. Fake 3D. Yeah, like remember like Mario RPG? That wasn't
[2471.14s -> 2478.82s]  real 3D. It was just fake 3D. It was sprites. Yeah. Yeah, like a sprite image or something.
[2480.54s -> 2484.38s]  Well, look at like polygons. Like I didn't know they actually had like modeled polygons or
[2484.38s -> 2495.19s]  something. I don't know. 2.5D isometric view. Like Mario 64. I guess Mario 64 is 3D. I understand
[2495.19s -> 2512.31s]  you, Jerma. Okay, good. All 3D is polygons. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. 5G Jerma. I'm making a new
[2512.31s -> 2519.98s]  emote. It's going to be Jerma 5G. And it's going to be that image that I just took of me smiling
[2522.58s -> 2534.74s]  with like scan lines on it. You know, like, huh? But I don't fucking know what's going on.
[2535.78s -> 2544.71s]  I think this is used to support. That's really awesome though. I know it's the same exact face
[2544.71s -> 2553.74s]  because that's what I know. Screenshot that one. All right, coming up next we have. Oh, this is big.
[2554.38s -> 2564.20s]  This is a big boy here. Jerma95 gumball eyes. $4.20. I think we've seen this image before,
[2564.20s -> 2582.52s]  but not on a community content night. So I love that emote so much. It just, it conveys so many
[2582.52s -> 2591.72s]  different emotions for me. It really does. I love it. Worst emote. No, worst emote is JermaTV.
[2591.72s -> 2600.38s]  And weirdly enough, I don't want to delete JermaTV because it's, it's, it's just, I don't,
[2600.38s -> 2604.38s]  you can't delete an emote. You know what I'm saying? Otherwise somebody will be very, very,
[2604.38s -> 2612.25s]  very mad about that. If you delete an emote, people, there'll be somebody, I'll get a letter
[2612.25s -> 2619.21s]  and it'll be like, Jerma, why did you delete JermaTV? I mean, there was a JermaTV community
[2619.21s -> 2628.92s]  where we did that and we used it. And I'm going to be like, and then I'm going to have to put it,
[2628.92s -> 2632.12s]  but I don't want to, you know, you can never delete something. You can only add stuff. And
[2632.12s -> 2640.15s]  especially considering, well, your vault, vault coin is going to get deleted. And this face is
[2640.15s -> 2643.83s]  going to get deleted too, because there already is one here. You know, there's going to be two of
[2643.83s -> 2650.17s]  those. So that's getting deleted. But you can't, I just don't want to delete that many emotes.
[2650.17s -> 2656.25s]  I deleted next. Yeah, I deleted next because it turned into one of the most spammable things
[2656.25s -> 2665.24s]  ever. And you could, people were just saying next on every single thing that was on the screen.
[2665.24s -> 2669.88s]  I would look over and it doesn't matter what it was. It was just like, next, next, next.
[2669.88s -> 2673.80s]  It took over the entire chat. So I was like, I got it. I have to get rid of this. What a mistake.
[2673.80s -> 2675.24s]  This wasn't for me to add this. I have to get rid of this.
[2681.10s -> 2688.50s]  Those are the old times. Some old things need to go away. You know what I'm saying? Like,
[2688.50s -> 2693.50s]  German next. It was only around for like two months. It wasn't like it's been here for like
[2693.50s -> 2699.66s]  five years. It was here for like two months tops. And then I was like, I can't do it anymore.
[2700.46s -> 2722.81s]  That's true. I know, I know. Here's another, uh, doodleishito. I'm not even, what is this?
[2723.53s -> 2738.04s]  Is this a cigar? I thought I'm drinking coffee. Am I drinking coffee through the cigar? Is that
[2738.04s -> 2750.41s]  what we're supposed to be implied? No, it's just, it's just here. Imagine you had a chin
[2750.41s -> 2758.28s]  that fucking big. I feel like it would be a problem. How many of you guys lie in bed like this?
[2758.28s -> 2764.71s]  Like even if my chin was like an, I got a big chin. I do. I have a very large chin area,
[2764.71s -> 2770.55s]  like frontal chin. If this was even another half an inch down like this, an inch down,
[2772.50s -> 2776.10s]  when I lie down in bed and I hold like I'm on my phone or I have like my iPad or I'm just lying
[2776.10s -> 2782.01s]  there, you know, you go like this. It would be, you'd make a mark here. You know what I mean?
[2782.01s -> 2786.41s]  Like it would just, if you have a big, huge chin, you'd be pressing it down like into your neck.
[2786.41s -> 2789.53s]  You would just like hit your trachea and you'd be like,
[2790.33s -> 2793.13s]  uh, you couldn't put your neck down.
[2800.54s -> 2807.32s]  Anyways, this is good. This is my first time drawing Jerma. Oh, it looks great. What did you
[2807.32s -> 2816.55s]  do this with? Uh, we sit in them here. This doesn't look like a mark. This looks like, um,
[2816.55s -> 2829.24s]  like crayon wax or something. It looks cool. It's digital. Well, if it's digital,
[2829.24s -> 2834.20s]  it's supposed to be mimicking something. Like is it looks like kind of like wax, like crayon.
[2834.92s -> 2841.62s]  All the brush and Photoshop. Yeah. I know. I know. I know. I'm saying like it's like it's waxy.
[2843.53s -> 2878.33s]  Look, do you know what I'm saying? It's texture. Yeah. Like a crayon, like you and what is all
[2878.33s -> 2883.77s]  these, the animals from the Sims, the Sims for a second. I was like, is this the right streamer?
[2883.77s -> 2888.01s]  Is this like a different person? Okay. It's the drug dealer from the sim. Okay.
[2888.97s -> 2919.88s]  Buy drug, please buy drugs from me. Clip and report him. Oh, get out of here. This is, uh,
[2919.88s -> 2930.02s]  at the very least seven four confirmed. We're, if we're being honest. All right. So then yeah.
[2930.02s -> 2943.24s]  So seven four, that makes me how tall that's a, let's just say that's a full foot, right? Let's
[2943.24s -> 2956.10s]  say this is a full foot shorter, right? That's like six four, six three. What does it say? By
[2956.10s -> 2961.78s]  the way, where to pop this shirt? LOL. Asking for a friend. Um, I got that Nightwing shirt
[2962.50s -> 2970.65s]  at a clearance section at, um, I don't remember the store. It was, it was, it was the clearance
[2970.65s -> 2974.89s]  section. It was just like, these are things that are on sale. Hey, it was from some comic book store.
[2974.89s -> 2983.93s]  I don't remember what it was. I don't want to give you false info. It wasn't Walmart.
[2985.34s -> 3008.41s]  Walmart does not have Nightwing shirts. I could do it. Same universe as Nightwing.
[3010.79s -> 3018.82s]  Yes, they are in the same universe. It's a clown car, I believe. Looking good.
[3021.06s -> 3031.42s]  Uh, I got something to tell you guys. Caught his mic. Oh, these are doodles. Okay. I'm never
[3031.42s -> 3035.58s]  getting rid of that shirt. I hope nothing bad happens to that shirt. Really. You know, sometimes
[3035.58s -> 3039.50s]  you go into the wash and you take clothes out and one of your shirts is just like torn up for
[3039.50s -> 3043.66s]  some reason. You're just like, oh, what the fuck? I really hope it doesn't happen to the Nightwing
[3043.66s -> 3053.27s]  shirt. It's going to get caught somewhere and get torn or something. I'm going to, now, fuck it. I'm
[3053.27s -> 3061.22s]  going to start hand washing that shirt. That's, that's, I'm hand washing that. I'm not going to
[3061.22s -> 3075.64s]  put it in the washing machine. I'm scared. Go down here to the rat. Michael smells. There you are.
[3075.64s -> 3086.23s]  Look, I even zoomed in on it. Everybody loves Sheet Hill. You know, has it made an appearance
[3086.23s -> 3093.30s]  on stream in like six months? He's on vacation. No, he's on vacation. I'll come back soon. He's
[3093.30s -> 3101.77s]  on a long vacation. He's on a very, very long vacation. And I realize that's what you say
[3104.22s -> 3115.90s]  children when, uh, somebody potentially dies. But Cheeto is doing just fine.
[3118.20s -> 3129.16s]  When your fish dies. Where's, where's Mr. Guppy? Oh, oh, little Timmy. He's,
[3129.80s -> 3134.76s]  he's just on a long vacation. Oh, because you know that that kid's going to forget
[3135.40s -> 3149.42s]  everything about that fish in like two months. But that's not the case. He went on vacation.
[3151.30s -> 3161.75s]  Uh, huge money came in. Huge money. Mick Tavishes gave 10,000 bits. Thank you, Mick Tavishes.
[3163.21s -> 3168.41s]  10,000 bits. Yoruba, I swore a long time ago that I'd give you big bits once I got a full-time gig.
[3168.41s -> 3177.66s]  I did. So here's big bits. Thank you. Those are very big. Those are enormous bits. Those are,
[3177.66s -> 3183.45s]  that's a hundred fucking dollars worth of bits. That's a lot of money. Thank you for the ridiculous
[3183.45s -> 3194.81s]  bit drop. Glad to hear you got a full-time gig. It pays well. Did you eat Cheeto? Is he inside of
[3194.81s -> 3218.68s]  you? Why did I read that one? Excuse me. I like this, uh, kind of the neon look. I like this down
[3218.68s -> 3232.09s]  here. This is a Jojo reference. It probably is. Yeah, it is. Right. I've never even seen Jojo,
[3232.09s -> 3240.17s]  but I feel like I know the first five episodes already. Looks very good though. I do like it.
[3240.81s -> 3254.82s]  Those like blended neon edges. I went to art school. Failed, but I did.
[3258.41s -> 3274.20s]  It's Mr. Sneak Man. Look at, look at this neck. We got the, we got the same neck. I'm not looking.
[3282.84s -> 3285.56s]  Ew. Yeah. I look at some, I told you, I don't care. At some point you have to,
[3285.56s -> 3289.40s]  at some point you have to accept that you have a turkey neck. Or like a turtle.
[3290.52s -> 3296.70s]  I remember a couple of years ago when I still was like, oh, I don't like that. I looked up
[3297.10s -> 3302.54s]  and this is real. I looked up like how to get rid of the weird turtle lines on your neck.
[3303.82s -> 3320.38s]  I looked it up. Uh, it turns out you can't, you kind of can't. I started moisturizing down here.
[3321.70s -> 3325.94s]  This is fine. This is going to be fine for a very long time. This is going to be just fine.
[3326.82s -> 3333.50s]  This, however, is not going to be fine over the next 10 years. I'm going to be one of those people.
[3333.50s -> 3339.02s]  I'm going to, I'm just going to wear turtlenecks. I'm going to be like at the beach in a turtleneck.
[3339.02s -> 3342.46s]  People are going to be like, oh, wow. How old are you? You look really, really young.
[3343.64s -> 3351.08s]  Yeah. I, um, I'm, I'm, I'm 41. It's like, well, your voice fucking sounds old for that.
[3351.08s -> 3354.52s]  Yeah. I'm 41. And my, but my face is going to look fucking fricking like this.
[3355.24s -> 3359.88s]  And then I'm going to, I'm going to like take my shirt off at the beach and it's going to be just
[3359.88s -> 3364.92s]  like dusty and wrinkled and decrepit. And everyone's going to be like, holy shit. I thought that guy was
[3364.92s -> 3386.20s]  like 40. He's like 70. I'm going to have like a young face at like 60. You're a lich. Ego. Perfect
[3386.20s -> 3406.15s]  face. You, we all have perfect faces in the eyes of the Lord. Come on. Oh, this is, oh, wait, wait.
[3406.87s -> 3422.62s]  This one's a little more abstract. Who is this person? I, I need, who is this person? I don't
[3422.62s -> 3428.30s]  know. Like who, who is this imitating this, like this thing? Who is this? What character is this?
[3428.86s -> 3437.77s]  The character's name is Killer Queen. I got, I got to look this up eventually. I'm going to like look
[3437.77s -> 3443.45s]  up, I'm going to go to like the Killer Queen, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Wikipedia profile fan page
[3443.45s -> 3459.03s]  and just read. I like this though. I'm a little more, I'm a little more jacked in this one,
[3459.03s -> 3471.53s]  the name of this one. I like how Bob, I got a nice, a nice, a nice buff look to me. Watch Jojo. No,
[3471.53s -> 3477.18s]  I can't. It's too many people have told me to do that. All right. You know when enough people tell
[3477.18s -> 3481.82s]  you to do something and they preface this always by going, hey, oh, you should really, you could,
[3481.82s -> 3488.54s]  you would really love Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, but skip the first two seasons though. No, no,
[3488.54s -> 3493.34s]  no, no, just don't watch the first like three seasons. Watch season four and season seven
[3493.34s -> 3498.39s]  and then they, and season six, halfway through season six. Don't watch the first two seasons
[3498.39s -> 3508.78s]  ever. Don't skip. What the fuck? Don't skip. What the fuck? Nobody says that. How many times? Hold
[3508.78s -> 3515.64s]  on. We gotta, we gotta go over this. People, I have heard not to watch the first season of Jojo's
[3515.64s -> 3519.00s]  Bizarre Adventure because it's like fucking different. It's not the same. People don't like
[3519.00s -> 3535.93s]  it. First season sucks. Don't skip it. Those are fake fans. Wrong. You see my eyes fucking scrolling
[3535.93s -> 3542.25s]  through this. Look at, I'm like, I can't even read, like, I feel like I'm reading a reverse teleprompter
[3542.25s -> 3548.18s]  and they have it at times 10 speed. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[3548.26s -> 3550.26s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[3550.26s -> 3553.62s]  I'll watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. That's my fucking, all right. You know what? Fuck it.
[3553.62s -> 3557.14s]  Listen to this. Listen to me. I'm gonna look you directly in the eye for this one. I am allowed
[3557.14s -> 3566.34s]  one anime per year. It's 2020 and it's not going to be Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It's, it's going to
[3566.34s -> 3600.60s]  be back on Titan season four. Oh, I like, this is good. This is a great image. It really is.
[3605.18s -> 3616.34s]  There's Halloween mask Jerma. This is a great image for, I don't know if it works in an emote,
[3617.43s -> 3633.62s]  but this is like backseat gaming. This is backseat gaming the image. I fucking know everything.
[3633.62s -> 3637.22s]  I'm sorry. I know everything about you and you're not doing it. Let me help you here. Let me help
[3637.22s -> 3642.10s]  you here. You insignificant tiny fucking non person that's ever played the game before. I
[3642.10s -> 3655.21s]  know everything. That's good. I like it. What else we got here? Then you got the stomach,
[3655.85s -> 3670.82s]  stomach is, is very accurate. Why is the giant ride coming to kill me? He's got a knife in his
[3670.82s -> 3699.03s]  hand. What does it say? Chat is cute. Oh, I don't, I've got, hold on. Let me move the camera for a
[3699.03s -> 3708.01s]  second. I want you to see who made this. I thought it was about him. It could have been.
[3711.94s -> 3733.08s]  Pymations. This is fantastic. Thank you. I love it. All right. This image just makes me happy.
[3733.64s -> 3739.02s]  You know what I mean? This is one of those images that you look at and you're just like,
[3739.66s -> 3746.33s]  I'm happy right now for a minute. The oven mitts. What a nice touch, right?
[3746.97s -> 3765.26s]  Can we have any nice things guys? Can we have nice things at all? Get your mind out of the gutter.
[3773.83s -> 3784.92s]  I, I don't mean, I don't know. All I see in this image are a nearly Academy award winning actor
[3786.62s -> 3794.44s]  and a top 20 streamer on Twitch. I don't, I mean, I don't see anything else in this image that could
[3794.44s -> 3815.37s]  be producing anything negative. I don't understand. I mean, I, I, I see like a, a, a nearly
[3815.37s -> 3825.14s]  Academy award nominated actor and, and, and, and, and, and one of the top influencers on the
[3825.14s -> 3832.76s]  platform. I fucking hate that word. That word sucks. Remember we've, we've gone over that word
[3832.76s -> 3841.74s]  before. The influencer is so stupid. It's like they couldn't figure out what to call this group
[3841.74s -> 3851.51s]  of people because let's be honest. It's not like, it's not like we're fucking solving
[3851.51s -> 3855.88s]  like world problems. You know what I mean? It's just like, Oh, what do you do?
[3861.27s -> 3875.45s]  Entertainer. Oh, do you though? Are you Adam Sandler? And they go, no, no, no, no. You influence
[3875.45s -> 3885.90s]  people to do things. That's so fucking creepy though. What I don't want to be like influencing
[3885.90s -> 3893.26s]  you guys to do something that's weird. Hey guys, I just want to make sure you feel very influenced
[3893.26s -> 3899.13s]  by me today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This, this, this, this, this is going to get like, this might get
[3899.13s -> 3905.19s]  20,000 influence points. I said something and you clicked on it and you, you agree with it and I
[3905.19s -> 3909.19s]  influenced your opinion. I'm influencing you right now. You just don't understand it. You just don't
[3909.19s -> 3920.82s]  know. No, I prefer Eclan. I way prefer that because influencer makes it sound like I'm supposed to be
[3920.82s -> 3941.21s]  selling a product right now. Eclan, way better. You are selling a product. You're selling. Hey,
[3941.21s -> 3947.78s]  BRBs buying a night wing t-shirt. I just want to dick around on the internet and like have fun. And
[3947.78s -> 3961.11s]  I don't, no, no, no, don't call me an influencer or I'll ban you. Your actions have consequences,
[3961.11s -> 3985.29s]  Jeremy. Wait, what? Inside of two Jermas. Jerma lied about what? Jerma lied about 20, Jerma lied,
[3985.29s -> 3997.53s]  Jerma lied about sour in 24 hours. No, I didn't. I did that within 24 hours. That's, that's horseshit.
[3997.53s -> 4006.30s]  I did that. We got another huge bits. Core Monster gave $50 in bits. You're my favorite influencer,
[4006.30s -> 4033.83s]  Jerma. Eclan. Eclan, corrected. Uh, thank you for the 5,000 bits though. You know how bad
[4035.11s -> 4041.51s]  somewhere in my brain I want to get on like the fortune 500 list and I could, it would be a fortune
[4041.51s -> 4053.14s]  500 Eclan. Can you imagine having to read that as like a guy that owns like 600 fucking real estate
[4053.14s -> 4060.44s]  properties? Oh, let me see where I am. Well, I own, what do I own? I own fucking, I own Macy's Target
[4060.44s -> 4068.20s]  and I also, I have 500 corporate offices. What's the next page? Jerma985, the influencer Eclan.
[4068.84s -> 4078.18s]  He just like tears it out and the fucking rips it and crumples it up and fucking eats it.
[4078.74s -> 4088.50s]  Still an influencer. Fuck. What does he do? What does he, what does he even do?
[4089.30s -> 4099.74s]  How, how he is, he's at 1.6 billion. I'm only in 1.72 billion. I can't, I can't let this happen.
[4099.74s -> 4115.48s]  I can't let this happen. I can't let this fucking Eclan take over my empire. Anyways, if anybody
[4115.48s -> 4130.84s]  needed any more confirmation as to Eclan. All right, this is like hurts my head. Okay. Uh,
[4130.84s -> 4146.04s]  red germ redemption. I think we've seen this before. This is still good. Still very good.
[4146.04s -> 4153.34s]  Free views. What the fuck? Come on. Get the helicopter sound effect on the last one. No,
[4153.34s -> 4172.15s]  this is good shit. Betty White the goat. You know, Betty White has a slot machine in Vegas.
[4173.50s -> 4178.62s]  It's called, I'm not, I'm not making the, it's called, it's called Betty White's Fairy Tales,
[4178.62s -> 4185.98s]  a story time or something. And she has this huge comically oversized like medieval book in her hands
[4185.98s -> 4191.26s]  and she's just like, Oh, hey, welcome everybody. It's me, Betty White. Welcome to my fairy tale.
[4191.26s -> 4195.74s]  Isn't she like tells you stories while you play the machine. I don't know this by the way. I've
[4195.74s -> 4208.98s]  just seen it. I've seen it in advertisement. She like reads the stories to you. I've walked by this
[4208.98s -> 4217.67s]  before going, just walked by it. So am I, am I right? 2020. Am I right for 2020? What do you mean?
[4217.67s -> 4234.36s]  Am I right? Oh, am I right for 2020? What does that mean? Anime, anime for 2020. What does that
[4234.36s -> 4246.38s]  mean? For some reason, the one that I said makes more sense to me. Fireman. This is from Mikey
[4246.38s -> 4267.96s]  Loki. I love this song. What a great game by the way. Such a good game. Betty White slot machine.
[4268.86s -> 4274.09s]  What would you guys do if one day I turned on a stream and I didn't introduce anything?
[4274.81s -> 4282.18s]  I was sitting in front of the Betty White slot machine and just played it for like four straight
[4282.18s -> 4295.66s]  hours. And then I, and I turned to the camera when I had no more money left. And I just go like,
[4297.80s -> 4309.45s]  hey, can I, can I bum a 20? Hey, can I bum a 20? And then, and then a hype trend happens.
[4310.01s -> 4326.97s]  I don't say a word for three hours. Nobody would give anything. I know. And they should.
[4327.69s -> 4333.53s]  Casinos and slot machines are a category on Twitch and there are quite a few servers who make
[4333.53s -> 4340.63s]  bank on that stuff. No, I, no, no. All right. Here's the thing about streaming. Streaming
[4340.63s -> 4347.59s]  gambling to me is the same thing. If I were to stream myself full screen, smoking cigarettes,
[4348.15s -> 4369.11s]  just talking. It's like smooth. That's very smooth. Or like just streaming myself
[4369.99s -> 4376.95s]  drinking alcohol full screen without even talking. I don't, you know, it's one of those things that
[4376.95s -> 4381.27s]  it's like, it's don't want to like, I don't want to like promote gambling to anybody.
[4381.83s -> 4385.59s]  I don't want to promote like smoking cigarettes. It's not like I would be
[4387.02s -> 4404.87s]  influencer, influencer, influencer, influencer. Let's zoom in here. Uh, this is called
[4406.01s -> 4410.33s]  chair Montauk. Hi, let me be frank, Mr. Elbertson. You were never going to get the job in the first
[4410.33s -> 4416.41s]  place. This is an institution full of children. I called you here to ask a question. Why'd you do
[4416.41s -> 4454.74s]  it? Why'd I do what? Small pupils seems confused or concerned. Chat told me to Christmas killing.
[4454.74s -> 4463.29s]  Okay. I see. Even though he killed Santa, he needs to be, he needs to have friendly eyes.
[4463.29s -> 4476.47s]  Most of the time drew. I drew this. Don't steal original character. And I got the Aquaman shirt
[4476.47s -> 4494.04s]  on. Wait, don't steal original character. And this me, this is me. People's legs aren't that
[4494.04s -> 4506.28s]  fucking long. I'm sorry. Oh no. Stolen. That was fucking funny. All right. We got fireman with,
[4506.28s -> 4518.46s]  uh, what's that say? Anybody know what that says? It says, look at this dude. Look at this dude.
[4518.46s -> 4538.26s]  That's awesome. Look at this dude. That's cute. Very good. Wait till you see the one. What are
[4538.26s -> 4548.74s]  you talking about? It says watch Jojo season four only. This is very, very good. The, uh,
[4548.74s -> 4561.18s]  any watermark on it? No, there's not, but very good. I can't fucking take it seriously. I'm at
[4561.18s -> 4590.57s]  my limit. You're about listening to farts, slapping. Let me move my camera out of the way.
[4593.50s -> 4601.88s]  This is from sins. Sin Sue. This is very, very, very high quality stuff here.
[4604.62s -> 4614.84s]  Here's some donkey donut because you're epic. I follow like fucking 20 people on Twitter and
[4614.84s -> 4620.76s]  half of them are people that I followed back when I was like a machinima partner in like 2012.
[4621.86s -> 4633.51s]  I don't, I don't even use Twitter. This is great though. Follow them. Follow this account. They
[4633.51s -> 4649.45s]  post fucking good shit. It's pronounced scenes. Scenes. Okay. Oh scenes. Blocking his name. I'm
[4649.45s -> 4659.06s]  trying. I think there's another one too, uh, by the same artist. There it is. Season four. A good
[4659.06s -> 4681.94s]  one. Season four. All right. Let me give, we're not ever knowing and not ever seeing what this was
[4682.66s -> 4689.59s]  and not knowing what I was doing. This is a pretty damn good job. I would say for not knowing. This
[4689.59s -> 4713.14s]  one, not so much. This one pretty damn good. I don't even know what I was doing, but this is
[4713.14s -> 4727.35s]  great. Germ stranding. Awesome stuff. Never played this game, but heard it was very good. But I have
[4727.35s -> 4737.40s]  this thing where I don't play games that are a hundred hours long. I don't really do it. Uh,
[4737.40s -> 4746.25s]  I just don't have like time. It really, I, Red Dead Redemption 2 took me think like 40 something,
[4746.25s -> 4754.98s]  50 something. I don't have time for it. No, I don't have time. I don't have time. This is awesome
[4754.98s -> 4767.03s]  though. You beat it off stream. I did. It's like 30 to 50 hours. Let's get that artist over here.
[4767.03s -> 4777.67s]  Make sure I don't block their name. Evan Maple Syrup. 100 hour stream. Imagine the joke potential.
[4780.01s -> 4789.10s]  Uh, no, I think after like 40 or 50 plus hours in the same game, that's when I start reaching
[4790.54s -> 4794.38s]  and I go, man, I've been, I've been doing the same thing for like 50, 60 straight hours.
[4795.26s -> 4799.74s]  I should probably like come up with something to do, say, and then people guys is where I get the,
[4799.74s -> 4813.46s]  that's where I get the farming minus twos. All right. Why is everybody spamming it? I don't get it.
[4814.02s -> 4820.50s]  I don't understand. It's just maybe like a big mouth, like a big toilet or something. What is
[4820.50s -> 4860.94s]  this? Toilet bowl that you shaded over. I don't get it. Why is there no toilet seat? That's a
[4860.94s -> 4869.99s]  good question. I don't know. Derma peeve. Look at this dude. Nice to meet you. Somebody gets it.
[4870.63s -> 4890.20s]  I never get dehydrated. I recycle all, um, I don't know what that is. This is show face, please.
[4891.24s -> 4895.16s]  I don't get it. This is supposed to be you. It's supposed to be you guys.
[4895.88s -> 4905.54s]  And then I'm showing my face. Yeah. The nice touch fireman is put out because of how wet I am.
[4908.66s -> 4918.06s]  No other face. I only have one, man. This is great though. Thank you. I'm gonna get some more here.

[4971.18s -> 4978.07s]  I don't think I've ever said it before. Look at how much bigger I am than these two puny,
[4978.07s -> 4984.63s]  puny combatants. I don't even stand a chance. Look, even you even need to bring a chair this
[4984.63s -> 4998.71s]  time. You got to bring a chair. This is the might that I, you know what I mean? I don't know. I'm
[4998.71s -> 5003.86s]  trying to think of the word for exudes. There it is. Thank you. Somebody said it. Uh, this is
[5003.86s -> 5024.82s]  great though. Thank you. From that one big chicken stream that somebody squished my face together and
[5024.82s -> 5057.08s]  just looks modern. Modern. Derma Warhol. Oh, this is impressive if it really is two inches tall.
[5057.08s -> 5062.55s]  That's kind of, that's very detailed for being two inches tall. Do you have like one of those big
[5062.55s -> 5078.87s]  magnifying glasses? Like the guys that fix watches? It's real life scale. Draw onto scale. Everybody
[5078.87s -> 5085.21s]  say it. Yell about it. Everybody yell it. This is really detailed though. It really is. Thanks a
[5085.21s -> 5103.03s]  lot Quinn. The Axe Fireman by Mikey Loki again. Look at the itchy eye. Sometimes this happens
[5103.03s -> 5110.49s]  where like the lining of my eye will just be itchy, itchy, itchy, itchy for not even like 10
[5110.49s -> 5119.83s]  minutes and then it goes away. Like, oh, it's horrible. It's just only one eye too. I want to
[5119.83s -> 5127.34s]  itch it. I know I try not to. Oh God. Oh God. What does this mean? What does it mean? What does this
[5127.34s -> 5137.70s]  actually mean? Anybody know what this means? It's just like, oh, horrible scratch. Itchy. Horrible.
[5137.70s -> 5153.43s]  This is great work though. Get well soon, Jeremy. And this is from Invaders. Doing my best. Doing
[5153.43s -> 5163.83s]  my best. Appropriate. How do they know about the eye? Spliceable spleen. Five immunity subs. Thank
[5163.83s -> 5170.89s]  you spliceable spleen. Look at eye drops. Eye drops are tricky for me because when I put eye drops in,
[5170.89s -> 5176.65s]  I know they're coming and I know it's about to happen and I just tear up. I start crying and
[5176.65s -> 5181.29s]  then it hits my eye and it's like just tears streaming down my face and it almost makes it worse.
[5186.50s -> 5191.24s]  It's, I can't, it's just weird to me. I can't, somebody else, I can't, if somebody else is
[5191.24s -> 5199.48s]  going to do it, not possible. I have to do it myself. Every time I'm outside in the wind,
[5200.92s -> 5206.74s]  I think it's just really sensitive eyes because when I go out in the wind, I will get these just
[5206.74s -> 5213.62s]  tears that just blow back like this until I get inside and then I have this like redness
[5213.62s -> 5229.86s]  from the lines of tears. Somebody's redeem a wink. Yeah, yep. Which eye? The irritated one?
[5230.50s -> 5234.09s]  You get to pick the eye. Which one? The irritated eye or the non-irritated eye?
[5235.13s -> 5255.61s]  Which one? Irritated? Irritated. Okay. I have to move my mouth when I wink. I don't know why.
[5257.32s -> 5263.24s]  You know what I'm saying? It's like the muscle that's here is connected to here. Is that odd?
[5263.24s -> 5290.49s]  Like, it's normal? Good. There you go. Excellent work. Whoa, this is, this is, this is busy.
[5290.49s -> 5297.35s]  This one's real busy. Let's get out of the way for this one. All right, we got the moon. We've got
[5297.35s -> 5306.07s]  Gloom Man. We've got Cheeto. We've got Pac-Man. Gloom Man. This is me. Beam Bag Sonic. That's the
[5306.07s -> 5313.83s]  air, hot air balloon. Nightwing. Why is everybody, what's with the Nightwing? How many times have I
[5313.83s -> 5326.42s]  worn that shirt on camera? Oh, it's Jax. That's right. It's Jax. Hundreds, you think? All right.
[5326.42s -> 5330.66s]  I just had a, you may have seen it in my face because the camera's on, but I just had like an
[5330.66s -> 5350.26s]  internal, is it on now? For a tenth of a second. This is fucking scary. What is going on here?
[5350.26s -> 5365.10s]  What is this? What? It's Fireman, but it is like a, what is the rat? What is this? Is this my room?
[5365.18s -> 5370.94s]  Oh, that's the door. Oh, the body sliders. Right, right, right, right, right. Okay. This is crazy.
[5370.94s -> 5379.80s]  This is crazy. I love it. An artist name? Any artist name on here? I don't see it.
[5380.36s -> 5390.87s]  I do not see an artist name. No, I don't. Thank you, though. Garfield down in the corner. I just,
[5390.87s -> 5423.66s]  I didn't acknowledge Garfield. I don't know what this is. It's a JoJo thing. I, I got, I got a question.
[5425.10s -> 5432.81s]  So, I've never seen the show. I don't know what this is. I don't know what that is.
[5433.61s -> 5448.55s]  What's the proper reaction to have to that image if I've never seen the show? Like, yeah, I know
[5448.55s -> 5455.66s]  those two people. That's, I don't know, for all I know, guys, this is, what the fuck is that?
[5459.42s -> 5465.66s]  Uh, okay. For all I know, wait a minute, I was going to say that, oh my God. Okay, I was just
[5465.66s -> 5471.26s]  going to say, for all I know, this could be Beavis and Butthead. And the image that I just showed on
[5471.26s -> 5486.65s]  stream was a combination of Beavis and Butthead. I was going to say this could be just Beavis and
[5486.65s -> 5503.05s]  fucking Butthead, and I don't know who they are. The ultimate streamer. Ask Joel about JoJo.
[5503.85s -> 5508.81s]  No, what is he going to say? Hey, dude, wait, what, what about JoJo? And he's going to go,
[5509.69s -> 5514.74s]  ah, it's a good show. You should watch it. Joel, are you sure you don't want to show me
[5514.74s -> 5526.95s]  these characters? Why don't you show me two of the characters on stream? Hey, Joel, what, hey,
[5527.11s -> 5531.91s]  Joel, what about, uh, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure? And he's like, oh, journal. He turns on his webcam
[5531.91s -> 5548.20s]  and starts like, doing like poses and shit. I'll be like, now I get it. Now I get it. But, uh,
[5548.20s -> 5553.46s]  long story short, I don't get it. Maybe some of you do. I don't know what this is supposed to convey.
[5554.26s -> 5583.19s]  There's no, no shoes on. No shoes on with a plastic bat. Oh, this is, and the, the picture
[5583.19s -> 5595.85s]  is going into the motion of throwing the ball and I'm not fucking ready. Oh, here's the back of the
[5595.85s -> 5601.72s]  card. Jeremy Elbertson, Boston Red Sox, hometown, Boston, Massachusetts. Positions shortstop.
[5602.97s -> 5607.93s]  After rage quitting tennis, Elbertson made his way to the realm of professional baseball
[5607.93s -> 5616.41s]  with an all-time batting average of 0.001, which actually means I probably got walked
[5617.29s -> 5623.03s]  once in 10,000 at bat. Oh no, batting average. That means I accidentally like,
[5623.03s -> 5628.79s]  bunted. Not on base percentage. Okay. Jeremy's only major league hit was a walk off grand slam
[5628.79s -> 5640.28s]  that won the Red Sox the World Series last year. Last year. When asked about the historic moment,
[5640.28s -> 5647.16s]  club manager Alex Costa said, look, this guy wasn't here supposed to be on the team. David Ortiz got
[5647.16s -> 5651.96s]  the flu and we just had to pick some dickhead from the crowd. Who even are you? How did you
[5651.96s -> 5662.47s]  get into the locker room? Did somebody link that video of me in the two grand slams? That's like
[5662.47s -> 5667.43s]  my favorite video. Where's the video of me doing the two big home runs? That's like, that's my
[5667.43s -> 5674.10s]  favorite video on YouTube. Where is it? I have to, I'm going to queue it up for the video portion.
[5674.10s -> 5695.06s]  I love that video so much. All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. Is this it? Sign in to confirm your
[5695.06s -> 5704.06s]  age. Oh, get the fuck out of here. Give me the real video. It's not it either. You guys are,
[5704.06s -> 5724.74s]  why are you guys so unhelpful sometimes? Right here, right here. No, that's not the one. This
[5724.74s -> 5733.38s]  is not the right one. This too. This too. I'm going to throw both. I love this so, no, I don't,
[5733.38s -> 5740.02s]  stop linking me this video. I know I said that 15 years ago. I know. All right, where's the,
[5740.02s -> 5763.11s]  where's the one that's the two? Unhelp. This is, what are you doing? No, you, I can see, I've
[5763.11s -> 5773.56s]  memorized the rickroll one now. Somebody please help me. Mods, mods, mods. I'm like calling my
[5773.56s -> 5787.40s]  mods like I call my mother. Mods, mods, mods. No, there's, there's, there's another one. There's,
[5787.40s -> 5796.34s]  there's one, there's two when I do the overhead swing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[5796.34s -> 5803.72s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Mods, mods.
[5806.98s -> 5820.82s]  No, mods. Soup has the right one. Soup. There it is. Okay, there it is. There it is. Oh my goodness.
[5823.50s -> 5828.58s]  This is like my favorite video on YouTube. All right. Okay, that only took fucking like
[5828.58s -> 5853.74s]  six straight minutes. Hi, bullet hole. Good shit. Show the video. I'm going to put it in this whole
[5853.74s -> 5858.23s]  video portion that's coming up in like probably 30 minutes. I'm not going to show it. I got it.
[5858.23s -> 5875.67s]  It's right. I got it. There's a whole video portion. Just, that one's free. Oh, I almost
[5875.67s -> 5892.39s]  instinctively just fucking clicked the X. Look at those. Look at those bumps. Thermobumpy.
[5897.48s -> 5902.76s]  All right. Click the X. Click this. Jeff, thank you. Thank you. Rhode Island, Jeff. Thank you.
[5903.32s -> 5906.68s]  Oh, this. Another one. Another one. Another one. I want to get rid of another one. I don't like the
[5906.68s -> 5921.13s]  veins in the eyes. I don't like the eyes. This is. All right. That's fucking really good art though.
[5921.13s -> 5931.77s]  Really good art by Iraqli. OD. Thank you. Outline Miami? Oh, look at this one. This one's good.
[5932.57s -> 5944.54s]  This is by Teens again. I'm going to get out of the way so you can see the whole thing. Christmas.
[5945.10s -> 5952.34s]  This is pretty much every major holiday terrain this year. In Germany you look like Harrison Ford.
[5953.06s -> 5960.14s]  That's a compliment. I'll take it. Motion blur. Yeah, that's a pretty good touch.
[5960.78s -> 5967.99s]  Those of you that might be new viewers, in point blank two, I did the bonus round, which is nearly
[5967.99s -> 5975.78s]  impossible for any humans to do. You have to shoot 30 targets that are in a line in five seconds.
[5975.78s -> 5989.11s]  Humans actually can't do this. I did it. You didn't do it. Fine. I didn't. Somebody else did,
[5989.11s -> 5996.20s]  but they live in my same body, so that's fine. The humans can't do it. They connected it to a
[5996.20s -> 5999.48s]  fucking computer and finally like scientists were all gathered around. They were like,
[5999.48s -> 6007.48s]  holy shit, we actually could do it now. And then I showed up. Or a person that lives in my head did.
[6008.68s -> 6030.26s]  That was not me. His name's Jackson. I love this. I want this. I want to sell this, but not this.
[6030.26s -> 6035.38s]  You know what I mean? You know, sometimes streamers and YouTubers do, oh, we're going to do pops.
[6036.02s -> 6040.42s]  Oh, yeah. I'm going to get a pop made of me, a little figure, and it's going to be me going like,
[6041.90s -> 6047.90s]  but like, I don't want that. I don't want just like a, no, no, no. I want this.
[6048.94s -> 6061.11s]  I want this to be sold. I want that to be me. I don't want it to be like a pop. I want to sell
[6061.11s -> 6077.24s]  something like this and have it just be supposed to be me. 3D printed. U2s it. What is U2s?
[6079.30s -> 6084.42s]  U2 sounds like, like, I feel like there's like a, like a, it's not like a dot com after that.
[6084.42s -> 6089.54s]  That's like a fake YouTube. Like accidentally have people click on something. U2s dot what?
[6098.90s -> 6111.19s]  That's like a, they make, they make pop vinyls for YouTubers. Oh, oh, okay. For YouTubers.
[6115.13s -> 6126.31s]  How expensive are they? Actual porn links in chat. I'm not clicking on anything.
[6126.31s -> 6128.15s]  I got plenty of links already queued up here.
[6135.16s -> 6141.24s]  Got the smirk down. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[6141.24s -> 6144.20s]  I am going to personally come in here and time this person up.
[6144.76s -> 6149.16s]  No, I can't even, cause I can't do that. Physically, I can't even right click in here.
[6149.16s -> 6159.96s]  Like the broadcast software that I'm using. I haven't changed. This is my own fault.
[6159.96s -> 6175.48s]  All right. Very good work. Very clean. I'm hogging Jerma. Please relax. Hold it in.
[6177.82s -> 6185.70s]  Hold it until the video section. Jerma, please. What? What? What did I just do?
[6187.18s -> 6193.67s]  Hold it in. I thought like, I'm like, by my breath, I'm hogging. Hold, ah, whatever. I don't care.
[6194.31s -> 6206.78s]  This is good shit though. Really nice work. This is a depiction of the Halloween stream
[6209.08s -> 6223.02s]  when, uh, Fugleberry was doing something and that's fucking funny. Free me?
[6223.90s -> 6229.02s]  Some of you that might have not seen the Halloween stream, uh, there was a segment
[6229.02s -> 6236.38s]  where BF Fugleberry, who's a very well-liked character, uh, did a pottery class to YouTube,
[6236.38s -> 6243.59s]  to you, to the people watching. There was a segment on that stream and the stream had
[6244.79s -> 6251.43s]  8,000 or 9,000 concurrent people watching it. And after about 20 to 30 seconds of this character
[6251.43s -> 6256.39s]  being on screen doing the pottery, this is not a joke. This is not me making this up and embellishing
[6256.39s -> 6264.30s]  to like, oh, look how funny, that's fake. A 3,000 concurrent people left. 3,000 concurrent people
[6264.30s -> 6288.89s]  dumped me fucking immediately. It was an unbearable segment. It was the reverb. I know. It was a lot
[6288.89s -> 6295.26s]  of things. But yes, this is, I love this. This is by, uh, Needles and Noodles, if you can't see.
[6298.82s -> 6302.42s]  It was the audio and I didn't even know. It's all right. I'm gonna never forget that.
[6306.49s -> 6317.70s]  Somebody just shit my pants. Also from the Halloween stream when I climbed. I do remember that.
[6318.42s -> 6330.87s]  It was a very, very uncomfortable feeling. Did not feel very good. By the way, you know, like,
[6330.87s -> 6333.59s]  when you, when you look at yourself in pictures or in the mirror or something,
[6334.87s -> 6339.11s]  I feel like, I feel like that's what I see in the mirror. You know what I mean? Like, there are days
[6339.11s -> 6349.18s]  when I'm like, no, I don't have a bald fucking head. It's the way my hair is parted. I just
[6349.18s -> 6355.24s]  want to make sure everyone's aware. It's the way my hair is just parted for a second. Black.
[6355.24s -> 6359.72s]  Nobody can freak out. I know the people are going to clip that and go, oh, because that's what we
[6359.72s -> 6364.20s]  do on Twitch. If somebody's got a bald head, we fucking point it out every day. If somebody's
[6364.20s -> 6369.96s]  smaller than 5'10", we point it out every day. And that's what we do. That's what we do on Twitch.
[6369.96s -> 6376.52s]  Welcome to Twitch.tv. Oh, it's nothing, but it's also everything. By the way, don't be bald or
[6376.52s -> 6396.65s]  small because we'll hear about it every day. Anyways, someone just shit my pants. Bald, bald.
[6396.65s -> 6408.60s]  It gets funnier every time. The music just like changed to angry and it's like fucking freaking
[6408.60s -> 6420.38s]  me out. Okay. Back to normal. Back, back to what we were doing. Community content. Like, oh yeah.
[6421.42s -> 6426.78s]  All right. This is just like, this is just a spray paint tool. This is just spray paint.
[6427.50s -> 6443.21s]  This is pretty good. This is pretty good. Oh, did you buy this on Redbubble? You got your weird,
[6443.85s -> 6459.29s]  like, what are these, what are they called? What, you got it? What's it called? A Germanium?
[6459.93s -> 6468.38s]  A Germanium? Uranium? What are you guys saying? Uranium. I can't, the chat is going too fast.
[6472.06s -> 6475.02s]  I can't read it. It's going too fast for me to read it.
[6475.02s -> 6484.14s]  Germanium. Germanium. Germanium. Pretty cool. Pretty cool. What does it weigh when people come
[6484.14s -> 6501.40s]  over? I think this is farming dynasty. Just scroll chat. No, that don't work. If I scroll chat,
[6501.40s -> 6506.68s]  if I scroll up, scroll up, it comes, rips back down. Scroll up, rips back down. It happens.
[6506.68s -> 6522.07s]  Who made this? Me. I did. Me, me. I did. Me, me, me. Yeah. Okay, cool. Nice job, everybody.
[6522.15s -> 6543.83s]  This is from The Sims. He's sick of us. No. No, I'm not. I mean, that did come off. That,
[6543.83s -> 6551.21s]  that did come off as, like, like, over it. But I assure you, I'm not. I just, like, I know that's
[6551.21s -> 6555.93s]  what's gonna happen. I know I'm gonna look over it. I'm just, I'm saying it for you. I'm doing it,
[6555.93s -> 6567.51s]  I'm saying it for you. You don't have to say it. He hates streaming. Do not. You wink and then you
[6567.51s -> 6580.78s]  leave. Why are you stealing our jokes? I'm here too, man. It can't be me. I made this. I made this.
[6585.99s -> 6597.43s]  No, it was me. No, it wasn't. It was me. I did this. My eyes at you again. No, you know who actually
[6597.43s -> 6605.48s]  did this? It was Rhode Island. You didn't make this. Neither did I. We have to unionize now.
[6607.19s -> 6615.99s]  You guys are gonna unionize. We're gonna unionize. It was the whole state of Rhode Island.
[6618.78s -> 6628.52s]  Why is my eye so itchy? Oh, I'm gonna get so mad. Oh, I'm gonna get so mad. What? So, so,
[6633.53s -> 6646.18s]  he's going too fast. Take a Benadryl. Oh, take a Benadryl. Oh, I'm gonna take a fucking Benadryl.
[6648.52s -> 6657.30s]  Hell, my 6k viewers have unionized. What the fuck would that even mean? This is awesome,
[6657.30s -> 6676.97s]  though. I love this. Thank you. This is from The Thing. Oh, I keep having flashbacks of that
[6678.17s -> 6687.30s]  particular scene inside of the vent. God, that game was fucking ridiculous. I don't own Benadryl.
[6688.02s -> 6694.39s]  Benadryl is a medicine that your parents have in the house, but you don't. You know what I mean?
[6694.39s -> 6707.98s]  I don't have Benadryl. I have Tylenol and Nyquil. This is fantastic, though. I love this a lot.
[6710.49s -> 6721.11s]  Test him. Test that guy. Test him. Make sure we can see the artist's name. If we do, we can.
[6721.99s -> 6727.35s]  If you take too much Nyquil- If you take too- Wait, hold on. If you take too much,
[6727.35s -> 6744.94s]  you'll start seeing spiders. Omega lol. Take too much what? Giant enemy spider. Benadryl. Is that
[6744.94s -> 6757.05s]  real? Omega lol. What? Fog champ. Jax. I have a Jax pose. Oh, this is supposed to be my smile.
[6762.92s -> 6781.27s]  God damn it. How did you know I was going to do this? Thank you, Todd. Oh, look at this one.
[6781.27s -> 6797.06s]  Stay tuned. Is this Shito? Snowman. This one's interesting. Look at all this stuff going on
[6797.06s -> 6808.34s]  back here. All over here. Snowman and Fireman. Wouldn't Snowman melt right now? Be careful,
[6808.42s -> 6823.80s]  Snowman. Stay tuned. This is a comfy image. Comfy image. Get the whole thing from it. Good
[6823.80s -> 6828.44s]  stuff. So you're going to notice there's probably going to be a little bit of Christmas or a lot of
[6828.44s -> 6832.52s]  Christmas related stuff in here. I'm sure you've seen a couple already. That's because I didn't
[6832.52s -> 6839.88s]  do a community content night in December. So this is like all of November into like the middle of-
[6840.68s -> 6848.86s]  the end middle of December. So that's kind of where the cutoff is here. My bird likes
[6848.86s -> 6858.66s]  your background music. Your bird's a hyper intelligent thing. It says, Jerma, I warned you
[6858.66s -> 6879.98s]  not to watch. Really good teeth work. But that's- that's really like high quality teeth. Gums and
[6879.98s -> 6889.91s]  everything. This is- it's terrifying. It's very well done. Good teeth, by the way. A coat hanger
[6889.91s -> 6899.82s]  in the closet. Down to the most minute of all details. Yes. Nice work. Who did this? Who made
[6899.82s -> 6922.34s]  this? Not on there. Nice work though. Is it on there? Look at this shit. Now this. Oh yeah.
[6926.15s -> 6938.26s]  I love how shiny it is. I'm gonna pick- this is gonna sound crazy. I know it is. Anybody else?
[6938.82s -> 6941.62s]  It's too weird to say. It might be weird. Anybody else want to pick this up and smell it?
[6942.58s -> 6947.42s]  I know what this smells like. You know, it's like a- that like kind of new plastic kind of shiny
[6947.42s -> 6970.02s]  plastic smell. You right? New GameCube smell. Sure. I know what this smells like and sometimes
[6970.02s -> 6983.32s]  I need smells to like get like into a full package. Can't clip this so I can- clip this
[6983.32s -> 6990.20s]  for the doctor because this- this whole thought is going to the doctor. Anyways, this is fantastic.
[6991.08s -> 7008.62s]  It is very well done. It's very professional and it is made by this person here. Okay, I was- this
[7008.62s -> 7015.56s]  one wasn't gonna make it in. Uh, but I- I mean like come on. This is just- I had- this- I- it's like
[7015.56s -> 7024.14s]  I'm gonna- I got it. I got it. This is cute. I love you, Jerma from Lucas. You and me. It's just like
[7024.14s -> 7037.48s]  that's- I can't- I can't just skip over this. Nice job, Lucas. Going on the fridge. And then of course
[7037.48s -> 7052.46s]  we have the best boy in the world, Otto. This is so cute. And like this music is like making me emotional.
[7055.86s -> 7059.70s]  You know what I'm saying? It's like I'm getting- I'm getting in the ears. I'm looking at this. It's
[7059.70s -> 7065.78s]  like this is so- this is so- I love this dog. You know what I mean? And I got this like cute dog music
[7065.78s -> 7083.32s]  playing in my ear. Looks very good. He's recovering very well, by the way. He has stitches that have
[7083.32s -> 7089.42s]  to come out next week. But he's healing and he's resting. He's doing good. And this is great. This
[7089.42s -> 7098.23s]  is awesome. Very, very good work. I love the cookies. Who stole the cookie? Thanks for this.
[7098.23s -> 7115.58s]  I'm sure we can see who you are. Can you see? Yes you can. There we go. What a good boy. This is
[7115.58s -> 7135.83s]  somebody made the giant rat in Spore. It's pretty good. Pretty good work. This is a military land
[7135.83s -> 7145.05s]  vehicle. Play Spore. I tried to, remember? I'll have to go back to it one day, but nice job. This
[7145.05s -> 7153.72s]  is awesome. I like the tail. The tail just looks like a plunger. It might even be a pl-
[7153.72s -> 7159.61s]  Are there plungers in Spore? They might be. You're looking at us, huh? Is it because we're dentists
[7160.41s -> 7175.14s]  of the Outer Worlds stream? Arguably the best part of that game were the dentists that weren't
[7175.14s -> 7189.46s]  even actually real. We made them up. Fun. This is great, though. Thank you. Fast German versus
[7189.46s -> 7200.57s]  Purple Alien. Classic series by one of the green screen video makers. Fast German versus Purple
[7200.57s -> 7208.52s]  Alien. Always, always trying to one-up each other. I wonder what's next in their adventure if there
[7208.52s -> 7215.19s]  ever will be a third episode or fourth episode. It's a great series. Maybe one day we'll get
[7215.19s -> 7228.12s]  another episode. And look, Fireman's got his seatbelt on. We're about to find out. Not today.
[7229.48s -> 7241.32s]  Not today. This is great, though. I love the helicopter. He's safe. Well, he doesn't want
[7241.32s -> 7251.96s]  to fall out. He's just a circle. The germacopter, yeah. That magenta and kind of teal look.
[7251.96s -> 7267.38s]  Magenta and green. Psycho bubblegum eyes. Choco hair. Sweat check. Gum smile and nose.
[7268.58s -> 7285.08s]  Strawberry milk flesh. Stick and melting. Anatomy of a germapop. We made it. I like these things.
[7286.04s -> 7294.71s]  The Spider-Man. Sonic the Hedgehog. I love those things. Even if they're weird and they look like
[7294.71s -> 7305.66s]  shit and they're gross. I love them. I'm right. I got it. What's the music? This is the Stardew
[7305.66s -> 7314.54s]  Valley OST. Playing in the background. Don't rub it. What am I supposed to do? I can't.
[7315.58s -> 7323.34s]  Don't touch it. All right. I won't touch it anymore. What am I supposed to do?
[7326.06s -> 7332.36s]  Wash it. Pour water in it. All right. Well, we're getting. We're almost at the end of the art
[7332.36s -> 7338.60s]  section. Then I'm going to. I'm going to flush my eyes. I will rinse my eyes with some water.
[7339.56s -> 7357.56s]  In about 10 minutes. Very good, though. Jax versus Jerma. I know who wins this one. Jax
[7357.56s -> 7373.94s]  every time. Always. This is by Rain Loaf. God, I love those old light gun games. They're so fun.
[7374.66s -> 7379.26s]  It's just you can't. You have to play them on a TV. And that TV was such a pain in the ass.
[7380.63s -> 7386.55s]  Once that TV got in that room, I couldn't fucking ever get it out until I moved across the country.
[7391.43s -> 7395.67s]  It's so fun to play them. I wish I could have captured it better, but you just kind of can't.
[7396.55s -> 7408.38s]  Delete the Z-Mode. This is awesome, though. It's like painted. It looks like a painting.
[7409.02s -> 7432.78s]  Floating around the universe. What is that? Is this a drone? Why am I? Watch out for the blades.
[7432.78s -> 7438.65s]  This is gonna like slice my arm off. Farmer's Dynasty guy. Oh, OK, OK. Right, right, right,
[7438.65s -> 7459.93s]  right. This is the Green Goblin. The Flannel Goblin. The Green Grinner. Yeah, because I'm,
[7459.93s -> 7463.21s]  yeah, because we were trying to get it to fly. I remember, yeah. This giant rat.
[7467.26s -> 7476.47s]  Flannel Farmer comes to New York City to deliver fresh produce. This does look like the front of
[7476.47s -> 7488.70s]  a cereal box. Like if this is a strawberry, this is a marshmallow sugary cereal. And it could be
[7488.70s -> 7500.84s]  called like Flannel Farmerose or something. Tomato cereal. And we need like healthier options. You
[7500.84s -> 7528.20s]  know, I would I would eat like a vegetable cereal. I wouldn't. Why is this image? I don't understand.
[7528.20s -> 7534.76s]  Like, is it Duncan? OK, let's see. America runs on Duncan. Dungandonas.com. Rain low.
[7535.48s -> 7550.22s]  That's my hand. You just, hey, y'all just got influenced. What do you think about that?
[7558.97s -> 7567.56s]  Oh, stop, stop showing it to me. I might order it one time. One dime. Weird. This is good,
[7567.56s -> 7582.81s]  though. This is very well done. Very well made. This is by Appleshift. A small, incredibly highly
[7582.81s -> 7600.30s]  detailed animated short here. Take on me. This is very, very, very good. This probably took,
[7600.30s -> 7606.22s]  this probably took a very long time to make. Each one of these images is as high detailed
[7606.22s -> 7615.94s]  as the last one. Thank you, Appleshift. This is fantastic work. Why is he so mad? Wait, what is
[7615.94s -> 7621.32s]  this? Why are you clipping this? What is this? Why, why play this right now? This makes no sense. I
[7621.32s -> 7643.91s]  don't get it. Sad. So sad. So sad. Oh, right, right, right. This was during Monster Rancher.
[7643.91s -> 7650.65s]  Why is this so sad to this part here? Because this is where Monster Rancher 4 is when this happened.
[7650.65s -> 7659.02s]  I don't, that game doesn't exist in my brain. It's OK, I get it. All right. All right. It's
[7659.02s -> 7675.93s]  the last thing you hear before you die. Another animation here. I don't know what this is called.
[7676.01s -> 7692.60s]  Jirba is a blocked person. Really good NBA 2K face scan technology, because that's what it looks
[7692.60s -> 7707.14s]  like when you did that in any of those games. God, this is fucking crazy. Mom did not get me
[7707.14s -> 7722.78s]  an ice cream cone, except this time I'm a bowling elf. Apologize for this. The Roblox guy? Why?
[7725.82s -> 7746.95s]  Good stuff. This is the same image on the screen. This is the wire frame of this. You know what I
[7746.95s -> 7765.43s]  mean? This is the same exact image. You look like the guy from Gorillaz. Murdoch? New Gorillaz member.
[7769.03s -> 7775.66s]  Yeah, I get some Murdoch vibes from this image I do. Of course I know. That's like my favorite band.
[7776.30s -> 7789.62s]  Nice stuff. Changing energies a little from here to here. Why is Fireman wanted?
[7790.42s -> 7815.50s]  Wait, what? That's not on my screen? No, that's in the image. I don't understand why he's wanted.
[7816.94s -> 7825.27s]  Because he killed Snowman. Here's your real face cam.
[7837.48s -> 7848.04s]  Don't worry, I'm just winking in this image. I don't know why I thought for one second.
[7848.92s -> 7853.64s]  That this hair was photoshopped on. I did not think this was real hair for a second. I was
[7853.64s -> 7858.04s]  like, well, what's wrong with this hair? It's like you like pull the hair from like somebody's ass
[7858.04s -> 7876.68s]  and put it on here. This is the only part that's photoshopped. Wearing a wig. Nice work. Oh, look
[7876.68s -> 7905.10s]  at this. Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken. That's what they were for Halloween. Group costume. Hey,
[7905.10s -> 7911.40s]  that's easy costume, though. That's cheap. Doesn't cost any money. Well, I mean, yeah,
[7911.40s -> 7918.20s]  I mean, yeah, I'm just talking about like this one. It's just, yeah, no, yeah, it did. Now,
[7918.20s -> 7924.68s]  this is like a good expensive costume. I just saw the coffee with like a tag, like a sticker that
[7924.68s -> 7932.46s]  says coffee on it. Well, that was, that was a cheap costume. Guy in chicken suit. Left to right,
[7932.46s -> 7943.40s]  Jeremy. We go left to right. I love this stuff. It's awesome. I can't believe three German fans
[7943.40s -> 7958.54s]  know each other in real life. Say it. I already did. I said coffee, Cheetos, chicken. There you go.
[7958.54s -> 7964.89s]  I am, I'll be honest with you, though. I am absolutely shocked and floored and surprised
[7964.89s -> 7970.87s]  by the fact that people think this is so interesting or so funny or they've taken it and it's something
[7970.87s -> 7975.19s]  that they like to a point that they're going to do a Halloween costume based off. That's just like
[7975.19s -> 7981.35s]  fun. Thanks for that. Thank you for thinking that's that funny. Thanks for thinking that
[7981.35s -> 7990.66s]  that's that interesting because it's just makes me happy. I'm glad you think it's fun.
[7991.38s -> 8016.95s]  Jeremy, I just made lobster rolls. Nice. Good work. You got to do something. I got to get,
[8016.95s -> 8023.99s]  I got to get in touch with the person responsible for making fireman because it's, you guys,
[8024.07s -> 8030.25s]  you guys love fireman. There's got to be some opportunity to do something with fireman.
[8032.14s -> 8048.04s]  And not in a T-shirt, something else. Steal the rights from them. No, no. I actually talked to
[8048.04s -> 8053.56s]  the person that did that drawing and we already agreed on that it wouldn't just be, all right,
[8053.56s -> 8057.24s]  thanks for the fucking thing that everybody in the community likes. Bye. Thanks for the money.
[8057.80s -> 8067.80s]  No, it would be very fair to them. As fair as I could possibly make it. No, because I mean,
[8067.80s -> 8076.66s]  that is people that just love this shit, you know, make like a flush toy. I'll have to look
[8076.66s -> 8087.80s]  into these. That sounds like the mafia. I'm going to make it as fair as I possibly can.
[8089.06s -> 8094.82s]  Yeah, that does sound like bad. No, no, no, no, no. I've made it fair. I said I've made it,
[8094.82s -> 8099.54s]  hold on. That's bad. Yeah, yeah, no, no. I've already talked to him. I've already talked to him
[8099.54s -> 8105.40s]  and I made it real clear to him. Made it real clear. That's going to be real fair to them.
[8105.96s -> 8114.25s]  To let me use that image. Real fair to you. I made it real clear. Jesus. No, I mean, I mean,
[8114.25s -> 8131.80s]  they're going to get paid. Sounds fucking horrible. Paid. No, paid in money. Paid? No, paid in cash.
[8132.60s -> 8143.34s]  This is fantastic though. Good work. I love the bright, sunny kind of shiny look. Very good job.
[8146.84s -> 8157.03s]  It's like they, it's like they can hear us talking. I swear to God, I load these images up
[8157.75s -> 8163.11s]  and I just go, go, go. I put them in a row. I, I, I've not like gone through all of these.
[8163.11s -> 8172.60s]  I load them up. I, I, I don't know. I swear to God. Paid and laundered money. Well, here it is.
[8172.60s -> 8178.44s]  This is what it might could potentially maybe look like in the future. I don't know. Give us this.
[8179.32s -> 8194.10s]  This is not mine. Somebody, this is, somebody owns this. I love it. That's awesome. Iron Man
[8194.10s -> 8217.32s]  is a currency. Legendary. Yeah. Legend. The grin. Pretty good grin. We can see that who made it,
[8217.32s -> 8231.03s]  right? There we go. Say the line. Thanos? No, I'm not Thanos. I never will be Thanos.
[8231.03s -> 8245.99s]  And why would I want to be Thanos? I want to be, I want to be Spider-Man. This is from Spooky's
[8246.07s -> 8253.22s]  Jumpscare Mansion. I hope that's in the game. Is it real? I don't know. Is it
[8256.31s -> 8265.54s]  really funny if it was? Uh, Vilemi just, just dropped 30 subs, 30 community subs from Vilemi.
[8267.30s -> 8280.09s]  Thank you, Vilemi. Huge sub drop from Vilemi. Thank you. Congratulations to those that now
[8280.09s -> 8292.25s]  can spam Jirba TV. That's a lot of subs. So many fucking community subs. Team TV. Now I can't delete
[8292.25s -> 8299.78s]  this. This is what happened. This says, my five-year-old niece loves Fireman so much.
[8299.78s -> 8313.51s]  She wanted to draw him for you. Ella and Pitcher Cat. I love you, Jirba. Get well soon. Love Ella.
[8317.91s -> 8328.90s]  So precious. So precious. I just hope that, I just hope that she doesn't watch when I talk about
[8328.90s -> 8345.98s]  shitting my pants. Hope she just sees the Fireman content. Family content. You just ruined a moment
[8345.98s -> 8359.91s]  there, but now you have something in common with them. This is so cute. This is adorable.
[8362.94s -> 8366.94s]  I'm telling you, Fireman's gonna be worth millions. Fireman's gonna be worth millions.
[8368.14s -> 8370.46s]  That's a, that's a, that's a 500 million dollar franchise.
[8372.46s -> 8386.28s]  So cute. Thank you. panthaneevadestaxes.org. Nevada Republican Party. I'm fighting for you,
[8386.28s -> 8398.09s]  Dean Dingus. Imagine if your billboard was, your billboard to run for president.
[8398.09s -> 8419.30s]  There's even an Aquaman t-shirt. The Nevada Republican Party. panthaneevadestaxes. Oh my god.
[8432.78s -> 8435.98s]  This is so stupid. The crying face.
[8438.28s -> 8448.22s]  That's from one of the DOS streams when we played, what's it called, like Treasure Hunter or something?
[8448.86s -> 8464.33s]  Treasure Catcher, Treasure Grab, whatever it is. This is very zoomed in.
[8487.02s -> 8504.02s]  Video game time. Got my nice slicked back villain hair that I have at conferences. That's a good
[8504.02s -> 8507.70s]  at teeth. I'm telling you, this is like the third or fourth image that has really good teeth.
[8508.34s -> 8518.97s]  I like this. I got more hair than that though. It's not fair. I got more hair than that.
[8519.93s -> 8529.02s]  It's thinning, but I still have more than that. And finally for the image section,
[8530.54s -> 8535.66s]  you've reached comedy level two. Jeremy can now tell a knock-knock joke to other sips.
[8543.16s -> 8546.98s]  Pretty good. That's it for the art. We're going to move on to the videos now.
[8548.55s -> 8553.67s]  And I'm going to go just, let me just rinse my eye because we're going to move on to the video
[8553.67s -> 8559.02s]  portion. Thank you everybody again for your artwork. That was part one. There's still about
[8559.10s -> 8565.90s]  20 days or so of stuff that's from the last 20 days. We'll be doing that next week. So thank
[8565.90s -> 8570.62s]  you everybody for your contributions, your artwork, your videos, which we're about to see.
[8571.66s -> 8577.50s]  And yeah, you guys are fucking talented. I'm glad to showcase talented people. It's a lot of fun.
[8578.14s -> 8780.60s]  So it's time for a pee break. Time to wash your eyes and I'll be right back. Hello everybody.
[8780.60s -> 8795.88s]  We're going to move on to the videos. There are, let's see, 50, 40 to 50, maybe 50 videos,
[8795.88s -> 8803.98s]  40, 40 videos. Big bits just came in. Even more money contributed to the stream. Thank you.
[8803.98s -> 8814.38s]  Thank you to Chachooty Chabooty for $100 in bits, 10,000 bits. 10,000. Thank you. Grandma,
[8814.38s -> 8818.06s]  I love you and your community so much. I never want you to stop. This is the only fraction. This
[8818.06s -> 8829.51s]  is only a fraction of the money that you deserve. Oh, let me stop you there for a second. I don't
[8829.51s -> 8837.32s]  have any plans on stopping, right? But I've told you guys this before, you know, as long as I'm
[8837.32s -> 8846.65s]  having fun, then I'm going to keep doing it. That's it. I'm never going to force myself to
[8846.65s -> 8850.81s]  do any of this, you know, because then it becomes, it doesn't become genuine,
[8851.69s -> 8856.58s]  but I'm still having fun and I'm going to continue to probably have fun for a long time.
[8857.78s -> 8862.10s]  But just know, I need to stay interested. I want to stay interested because I don't want to just
[8862.10s -> 8868.30s]  do it because I want to where I have to. You know what I'm saying? That's like two more weeks of
[8868.30s -> 8876.15s]  stream. No, but that's, that means a lot. And then they say, uh, you deserve this for the countless
[8876.15s -> 8880.47s]  hours of entertainment you've given me and my friends. I think I have seriously watched ask
[8880.47s -> 8886.39s]  nicely for crits and pulling it off with the pump brothers 500 times each. Sorry that I'm not able
[8886.39s -> 8891.11s]  to make it here more often. Uh, love you. Wish you the best of luck with all your future projects.
[8891.11s -> 8905.59s]  PS chat has a nice booty. Well, thank you. Uh, hold on. We'll get away for the car drive by.
[8907.14s -> 8913.16s]  Never apologize for not being able to make streams. Some of these go very long and they go deep into
[8913.16s -> 8919.24s]  the night and they happen more than a few times a week. So don't feel like you're obligated to
[8919.24s -> 8924.25s]  have to be here. I know that's asked a lot. It asks a lot of people to be like, oh yeah, just,
[8924.81s -> 8932.34s]  uh, spend 40 plus hours, 30 to 20 to 40 hours a week with me. People have things to do. They
[8932.34s -> 8938.42s]  have things come up. I don't, you don't have to be here. You don't want to, you speak very fast.
[8938.42s -> 8946.42s]  Do I speak really fast? I slow down a little. All right. I'm just all right in the future.
[8946.42s -> 8951.30s]  I'm going to slow it down. So from here on out, my voice is going to be at a speed. That's minus
[8952.26s -> 8962.02s]  4% from here on out. Good. But no, thanks a lot to booty. Anybody that's watched the video,
[8962.02s -> 8967.61s]  like I've made that many times just, it surprises me every time somebody says
[8969.77s -> 8983.66s]  thanks for the a hundred bucks back to it. We're going to the video portion now, as you can see,
[8986.38s -> 8998.54s]  incorrect. No spoilers up top. I don't want you to see spoilers. This first one is called
[8998.70s -> 9005.05s]  stardew valley has to stop playing. All right. Here we go. I'm going to go off cam for these
[9005.05s -> 9009.29s]  because I'd rather we experienced it together rather than me have my face covering up a bunch
[9009.29s -> 9015.14s]  of it. So let's go. It's called animated. I mean, we're talking mainly bug. And when I say we're
[9015.14s -> 9024.60s]  talking bugs guys, we're talking like grasshoppers, ants, beetles, spiders. Would you eat a spider?
[9025.72s -> 9034.34s]  Good. I wouldn't see like ants are one thing, just regular black ants, not like fire ants,
[9034.34s -> 9044.50s]  just regular ants. I feel like I wouldn't be that huge of a deal to me. If I knew they were clean,
[9045.06s -> 9050.58s]  it was like they were three doctors and two scientists that were standing around in a
[9050.58s -> 9054.25s]  circle around me while I was about to eat it. And they all the all of them are just like,
[9054.25s -> 9059.06s]  yeah, that's delicious. You go ahead. The nutritional value is off the charts. And it's
[9059.06s -> 9068.07s]  great. It's better for you than eating an apple. Maybe. I don't know. One of those scientists
[9068.07s -> 9083.24s]  says it might not be a good idea. I'm it's gone. All right. Where is this supposed to be? Wait,
[9083.24s -> 9105.45s]  what? I mean, we're talking. What happened here? Oh, it's during that was a long time ago. Wait,
[9105.45s -> 9114.06s]  that was a very, very long time ago. I thought I didn't I talk about this like, like, not even
[9114.06s -> 9130.70s]  two months ago. Holy shit. What a weirdo. On to the next one. That was pretty good, though.
[9130.70s -> 9139.18s]  That was pretty good animation. Wait, hold on. Is it another one? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9139.18s -> 9153.96s]  There's another one. I'm confused here. Wait a minute. Mainly bug. When I say we're talking
[9153.96s -> 9161.24s]  bugs, guys, we're talking what is there another one of these like grasshoppers, beetles, spiders.
[9162.20s -> 9172.66s]  Would you eat a spider? I wouldn't. Why is this coming back? Why is this coming back?
[9172.66s -> 9179.62s]  Is your one and five teaser animation? Really? But when I say we're talking bugs, guys, we're
[9179.62s -> 9197.35s]  talking my ears. That was no spoilers. No spoilers. All right. That was this one's called
[9197.35s -> 9211.05s]  Jerma dream. Siri, take a note. No, no. What's the note? It's not a cave.
[9213.30s -> 9220.14s]  Sharing two sticks with a guy, some homeless guy threw up in his mouth. Mickey Mouse comes in
[9221.22s -> 9237.21s]  and drains all my battery from my iPod. I kiss him. Siri. I think this is a dream thing.
[9238.17s -> 9242.25s]  I think that's a dream that somebody did somebody have that dream or
[9244.87s -> 9254.62s]  I don't know. Take a note. No, no. What's the note? It's not a cave. Sharing two sticks with
[9254.62s -> 9262.89s]  a guy, some homeless guy threw up in his mouth. Mickey Mouse comes in and drains all my battery
[9262.89s -> 9270.01s]  from my iPod. I kiss him. You were talking about keeping a dream journal and how fucking weird it
[9270.01s -> 9286.39s]  is. All right. Yeah, I see. I feel you. This one is called Jerma in Star Wars. I feel like I'm in
[9286.39s -> 9306.18s]  fucking Star Wars. I ain't slowing down for nothing. Oh, what? You just put the V. It's just the music.
[9307.06s -> 9323.43s]  I think I just ripped out the code. Stormtrooper. All right. Moving right along. This one's called
[9324.15s -> 9332.47s]  1985. The ideal set up by the party was something huge, terrible and glittering.
[9332.47s -> 9339.10s]  A world of steel and concrete with machines and terrifying weapons. A nation of warriors
[9339.10s -> 9350.47s]  marching for the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually worked the same face.
[9352.55s -> 9362.97s]  Mike Tyson, the hardest puncher ever. Magic and punch in the face by Mike Tyson.
[9363.69s -> 9372.12s]  This is awesome. Machines and terrifying weapons. A nation of warriors and fanatics marching
[9372.12s -> 9380.62s]  forward in the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually worked.
[9380.62s -> 9384.84s]  Except for these guys here. Those are the two main characters.
[9392.55s -> 9403.38s]  Jesus Christ. This one's called the Jerma Showdown. I think we may have seen this
[9403.38s -> 9407.30s]  at the end of a stream. I think I put it on one time, but it's probably worth seeing again. Maybe
[9407.30s -> 9439.64s]  we haven't. Maybe something similar. You're going down. You're going down. This is so stupid.
[9440.20s -> 9441.08s]  What a loser.
[9448.20s -> 9459.78s]  Wait, it was an ambassador body shot? An ambassador body shot. Holy shit, that's fucking funny.
[9470.01s -> 9476.20s]  This one's called Just Waters of Nazareth. Whatever that means.
[9490.89s -> 9513.85s]  Pretty good. Pretty good. My first encounter with Jerma. My first encounter with him.
[9514.73s -> 9536.71s]  This is what it looks like if somebody were to make my whole face out of paper.
[9537.91s -> 9544.36s]  My entire body is made out of very delicate paper and it's your mother packs it into your backpack,
[9545.08s -> 9548.68s]  but doesn't really put the care necessary into making sure it doesn't get ruined.
[9549.88s -> 9558.26s]  And then you take this out in class and you're like, mom, what the? Mom, why did you put it in
[9558.26s -> 9562.50s]  here? I told you I wanted to carry it. And she was like, you're not carrying that. It's too delicate.
[9566.12s -> 9574.92s]  And then you have to have everybody see this. So you're implying that you're my homework.
[9576.12s -> 9585.35s]  In a sense. In a sense. This is called a crude pre-stream thesis. This is a song.
[9585.91s -> 9597.37s]  This is from Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it's a custom song. Let's see. Let's hear it.
[9612.23s -> 9617.24s]  I pronounced it correctly. Of course it is.
[9630.10s -> 9640.52s]  So it is custom lyrics too. All right. Let's see it. Let's hear it, man.
[9711.58s -> 9724.94s]  That was awesome. That was awesome. Y'all didn't want to give that one a chance until it got started.
[9735.62s -> 9746.06s]  Gift this person a sub for crying out loud. Nice work. That was really, really, really good.
[9746.86s -> 9761.96s]  There it is. Somebody did it. Clap, clap, clap, clap. Collapse all around. This one is called
[9762.84s -> 9768.44s]  German Wars, a Star Wars one. Hopefully there's not. All right. If you've never seen Star Wars
[9768.44s -> 9773.08s]  before, there might be a Star Wars clip in here. If you've never seen Star Wars, I guess it might
[9773.08s -> 9778.70s]  be a Star Wars clip. Am I gonna? Should I? Can I show this one? I think it's just like a joke,
[9778.70s -> 9782.38s]  right? All right. The Star Wars coming up. Here comes a Star Wars one.
[9783.18s -> 9805.42s]  Oh, this is like.
[9820.60s -> 9832.78s]  Is that a grenade?
[9832.78s -> 9843.38s]  Red group, go group. All fighters follow me. I told you they'd do it.
[9846.34s -> 9854.89s]  I'm going down. Here goes nothing. I'm going down. No, we're not. We're fine.
[9866.78s -> 9888.38s]  Oh, shit. Sorry. Sorry. Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.
[9888.38s -> 9891.18s]  Intensify the forward. I don't want anything to get through.
[9891.18s -> 9908.92s]  Wait, hold on. You can't just end it like that. You can't just end it like that.
[9928.98s -> 9939.24s]  I fall twice. Okay, my stomach hurts. What happened? Look at the title.
[9940.04s -> 9946.04s]  German wars return to the two minute max runtime. This is going to be like five minutes long,
[9946.04s -> 9956.84s]  so I had to make some big adjustments laughing. That's the best part. That's seriously the best
[9956.84s -> 9973.61s]  fucking part. Oh, my God. Link link. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You want you definitely. I love porn tabs.
[9974.94s -> 9983.51s]  Oh, man. That was funny. That was by Coco Jam. Nice work, dude. Seriously. All right. This one's
[9983.51s -> 9990.54s]  called huge German shitpost, so I'm ready. I'm ready to mute this one. I got my finger on it.
[9992.38s -> 10048.66s]  Vaude. He was going to skip. I mean, I'm just standing around. Did I just lose my vaude?
[10048.66s -> 10056.70s]  Did my vaude just get fucking crushed? I mean, the title, it is titled huge German shitpost.
[10056.70s -> 10066.23s]  Did I lose the vaude? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Moving on. Moving on.
[10066.23s -> 10072.23s]  Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. This is German the hedgehog 2019 movie teaser.
[10096.87s -> 10108.46s]  This summer. It's pretty good. Quality shitpost. Yeah. This is called. This is called
[10108.46s -> 10115.75s]  German destroys the cutest thing ever. And you have the money to spend. I already know what these.
[10116.79s -> 10120.23s]  I already know this video. I already know how this video ends.
[10121.19s -> 10127.54s]  You know, we've all we've seen the video. All of us have seen this video now, right? All right.
[10127.54s -> 10133.06s]  Listen, and you have the money to spend. I would get rid of one of these. I would make a statement.
[10134.42s -> 10138.98s]  And if you want to hear what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about a real state.
[10146.34s -> 10152.60s]  What would that be the cutest? What would this be the cutest fucking thing you've ever seen?
[10155.85s -> 10172.42s]  My god, this is called a rant wasp and the man rant wasp and the man.
[10173.70s -> 10183.13s]  So I think the thing about, um, I think eating going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[10184.33s -> 10188.81s]  Oh shit. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait till he lands. Wait till he lands.
[10189.53s -> 10206.62s]  Okay. He landed up in smoke. The roles have been reversed. Yes, they have no.
[10206.62s -> 10209.74s]  Who cares if I even show spoilers? You know, there's no spoilers to see.
[10211.32s -> 10217.72s]  Uh, we, uh, this is worth showing again. It is. This was shown at the very end of the stream one
[10217.72s -> 10223.56s]  night and it's fucking hilarious. So this is the, uh, this is a wager fulfilled pepper.
[10224.52s -> 10239.22s]  I got time. No, no, please. No, I'm trying to turn it. No, I'm trying to turn it. If I go into the
[10240.02s -> 10245.06s]  black hole one more time, I'm I'll eat a ghost pepper on screen. You know what I mean? Like
[10245.06s -> 10249.54s]  that's the kind of shit I need to make sure I don't do. Wouldn't that destroy my stomach? Yeah. So I
[10249.54s -> 10303.30s]  better not go in the black hole. This has to go up. This has to go up. Uh, this next one.
[10304.82s -> 10332.84s]  Whatever. Just play it. Play it. Oh no, my C drive. C, Jeremy downloads. Oh fuck. There is no sound.
[10333.80s -> 10352.41s]  What do you think this is? Yeah. Some mad man made this and also made this.
[10353.45s -> 10363.38s]  I'm not sure whether to be happy or to be very upset about this,
[10364.58s -> 10373.50s]  but now it exists in front of a green screen. So you can do things like this.
[10386.38s -> 10432.82s]  There's the trumpet or whatever, a horn, some kind of horn. She's a stupid streamer.
[10433.94s -> 10439.62s]  Jay Bum Bum said that you, how did you get that name? I can't believe that. That's the real Jay
[10439.62s -> 10448.39s]  Bum Bum that just said that. But yeah, now people can do shit like that. This one is called
[10449.35s -> 10466.79s]  Psycho Streamer Destroys Cybertruck. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Oh my fucking God. Well, oh,
[10467.75s -> 10479.46s]  maybe that was a little too hard. Should we try on the mirror? It didn't go through.
[10479.54s -> 10483.86s]  That's a plus side. Okay. It's beauty.
[10509.94s -> 10511.06s]  Maybe that was a little too hard.
[10524.95s -> 10525.99s]  Okay. It's beauty.
[10531.99s -> 10550.23s]  This is like, this might be one of my new favorite videos. It's just, it's just so stupid.
[10551.35s -> 10558.49s]  It's just, you find the perfect places to put these stupid things. Is it better than the
[10558.49s -> 10565.51s]  baseball? No, nothing ever will be. But that's still, that's still fun. Slate me. That was so
[10565.59s -> 10572.84s]  fucking stupid. I love it. This one is called Fireman's First Christmas. If you remember,
[10573.88s -> 10603.75s]  I believe this is the same animator from last time. Nobody say any swears.
[10604.55s -> 10642.79s]  There's a five-year-old that's going to watch this. That's a little too hard for me.
[10662.33s -> 10694.60s]  It's snowman. Their first meeting. Hey, that's not very funny snowman.
[10695.48s -> 10715.75s]  They're going to keep, it's a never-ending conflict. The unstoppable object versus the
[10715.75s -> 10748.39s]  immovable firepower, whatever it is. Why am I outside? What am I doing out here? Look,
[10748.39s -> 10798.28s]  they're friends. They found a way. Uh-oh. Do I get out of here? Help me. Do I not have a bed?
[10798.28s -> 10814.95s]  Look, it's Otto. I'm sleeping. What? I'm sleeping. I'm sleeping.
[10821.82s -> 10839.13s]  Fireman's First Christmas. That was so cute. Cast, Jeremy Albertson as me,
[10839.13s -> 10845.05s]  Fireman as fireman. Look at this dude. Snowman as snowman and sleeping dog is Otto.
[10846.01s -> 10868.66s]  What is going on there? That's not my face, right? That is not my face. It's not. No,
[10868.66s -> 10875.86s]  it is not. That's not my face. That's somebody else's face on my body or something. That's not
[10875.86s -> 10880.36s]  my face. It's not real. I know it's not real because I know what my face looks like.
[10882.97s -> 10889.29s]  That was fantastic. We're a little late. Christmas was a little while ago, but
[10890.25s -> 10896.09s]  uh, Kitchicat, that was again, fantastic. Very, very, very well made. Very cute.
[10899.67s -> 10905.37s]  We all love it. Coming up next, this is called Jirva at the Carnival.
[10906.25s -> 10919.14s]  Do we have audio on this thing? Oh, that was loud. Try it again. Do we have audio on this thing?
[10919.14s -> 10942.79s]  Let's find out. Does it have audio? Can you hear it? I got, I have no reaction to what just happened.
[10942.79s -> 10946.55s]  I was initially going to start laughing, but then I was just like, oh, I, I, I don't,
[10946.55s -> 10966.25s]  I have no reaction to this. It was just too much. Okay. The, the fact that it's stuck,
[10966.25s -> 10979.86s]  it stops when I turn around and it tails off killing me. Oh, that's fucking funny.
[10980.82s -> 10987.50s]  What else we got? This is called Jirva Loses His Sanity. Here we go.
[10998.79s -> 11038.55s]  I'm confused. All right. That was called
[11039.67s -> 11044.76s]  Insane or whatever it was. Um, have we seen this one before? I think we may have seen this.
[11045.72s -> 11049.26s]  It's definitely worth showing again. It's another Star Wars one. Don't sue me.
[11074.09s -> 11095.66s]  Oscar? Oh, I get the Oscar. Another Star Wars one incoming. I hope you guys have,
[11095.66s -> 11109.99s]  I hope you guys have seen the movie Star Wars franchise. Do we have audio on this thing?
[11109.99s -> 11127.83s]  Let's find out. That was a, that was a good clip. I liked that one a lot. It was very good. That
[11127.83s -> 11137.66s]  was really good. I liked that one. Nice work. Any more Star Wars? Now this is a Jirma's house tour
[11138.22s -> 11143.50s]  and already from the first frame here, this is accurate. This is very scary. How accurate this
[11143.50s -> 11149.98s]  is. I like this. They say, I hope you like it. By the way, there is no Jirma is small joke here.
[11150.62s -> 11155.18s]  The doors are big because I can't do proportions. The bed is a reference to a stream.
[11159.75s -> 11171.70s]  Let's find out. By the way, there's no short joke here. This room, this looks exactly like the room.
[11174.84s -> 11196.84s]  The music too. How'd you get the music in here? Kim, yeah. Let's see if it's accurate. This is
[11197.40s -> 11211.40s]  it's 100% accurate. It's my green screen room. What else? Where else we going?
[11212.44s -> 11227.02s]  Hang a right and this brings us to bedroom. Okay. Hold on a minute. Pause the video.
[11229.08s -> 11233.08s]  This is like kind of, this is a joke, but how awesome would this be?
[11233.96s -> 11257.86s]  This would be incredible. It's a normal bed. Now let's not look at the door. This is actually
[11257.86s -> 11281.16s]  really well made. Toilet. Am I going to piss? I'm going to have to close it if I piss.
[11282.04s -> 11289.34s]  I like, I would like that. I would like that. I really would. That painting, the paint job.
[11295.82s -> 11302.33s]  I want a weird ass room. You know what I mean? Eventually I just, I just want to have
[11302.33s -> 11314.01s]  just some strange ass rooms that have wild paints on them and fun. That was really well made. Nice
[11314.01s -> 11322.44s]  job. This one says this is secret dog ending is what this one's called. Secret dog ending.
[11323.24s -> 11345.72s]  Let's see what it is. There you go. Auto spotted. Bad dog. Bad dog.
[11346.68s -> 11372.62s]  Uh, this is very, I like the, the, uh, I want to see it again. I love the like,
[11372.62s -> 11383.54s]  hi everybody. He's like sad. All right. Let's watch it. There you go. Auto spotted. Bad dog.
[11387.48s -> 11410.42s]  Bad dog. That was, that was ridiculous. This is how I attack. That was a Garfield scream.
[11411.46s -> 11417.96s]  Holy shit. That was a Garfield scream. No, no, no, no. That's, that's, that's Tom from Tom and Jerry.
[11418.20s -> 11423.48s]  Right, right. Not Garfield. Garfield didn't scream. Since when does Garfield scream? Okay.
[11423.48s -> 11428.04s]  This one's called, uh, shut the fuck up. I'm listening to Bratz birthday mixtape.
[11442.04s -> 11461.26s]  Oh, there it is. There's like the guy. I really like lick my mouth every 15
[11461.26s -> 11473.42s]  seconds. Oh, I need lip balm. I got these dry ass lips. This is, uh, I've been showing this
[11473.42s -> 11478.70s]  before, but I don't think I've ever shown this on stream. This is called, I can't even save in this
[11478.70s -> 11510.36s]  game anymore. I don't, I don't really know the context of this, but he tries to fight him. And
[11510.36s -> 11519.22s]  all right. Like what's, what are these auto automatic fucking videos? Must watch. Yeah,
[11519.22s -> 11524.44s]  I ain't watching your shit. So what, what's that? What's that a reference to? What's, what's that?
[11524.44s -> 11528.84s]  I can't save in this game anymore. What's this? Is that like a CS go gun game or something?
[11529.64s -> 11535.54s]  I'm not going to watch that. I don't want to watch that. We've got like fucking 15 more videos.
[11536.50s -> 11549.19s]  It's a famous bunny hopping video and see if CS go. You can save your items at the end of the round.
[11549.19s -> 11558.22s]  Oh, it's a currency thing. Ah, I see. I see. By the way, the video has 300,000 views.
[11559.18s -> 11572.28s]  Currency thing. All right. This one's called parks and recreation, but it's German
[11573.08s -> 11579.69s]  parks and recreations, but apparently it's, it's me. No, careful.
[11613.42s -> 11617.42s]  People are still ending these videos with the earth exploding from rat moving.
[11618.30s -> 11627.86s]  I think I've said this before. That's the easiest way to end a video. It's so simple. If you're just
[11627.86s -> 11634.50s]  like, how the fuck do I end this video? Easy. Just have the earth explode. There's that's why I did
[11634.50s -> 11643.02s]  it. It was just, I don't know how to end this. I don't want to do that much more work. So let's
[11643.02s -> 11648.94s]  the earth explodes. Okay. I really love reading a book. Yes. That's another way to end. It's just
[11648.94s -> 11656.17s]  ways to make it so you don't have to do any more work. I think this, if this is what I think it is,
[11656.17s -> 11668.46s]  I'm shocked and kind of, I can't believe it. I played fear. I played fear a couple of months
[11668.46s -> 11674.70s]  ago and one of the things that I was doing was going around because just ADHD. Like I just
[11674.70s -> 11684.95s]  couldn't help it. I was breaking fire extinguishers and I think I mentioned to clip every time I hit
[11684.95s -> 11697.26s]  a fire extinguisher. I think somebody did it. Thermosphere of fire extinguishers.
[11698.74s -> 11716.06s]  I don't know about this one. Can I use this? Is it explode? Yep. All right. Here we go. Three times
[11716.06s -> 11734.17s]  bigger. This is going to give me a headache. I don't know. For some reason I thought I had to
[11734.17s -> 11742.63s]  use that. How is it already broken? Impossible. What? Oh, this is where I came from. Right. Thank
[11742.63s -> 11749.13s]  God. And that's, you guys wonder why I'm doing that. Why does he keep breaking those? Well,
[11749.13s -> 11760.36s]  because it's a breadcrumb trip and I know where I've been. There's nothing in there. There's
[11760.36s -> 11765.08s]  nothing in there. What are you doing? Oh, I don't, I can't, do I have him in a full retreat?
[11771.29s -> 11777.29s]  All right. Guys, when Dwayne the rock Johnson is standing there and he's like flexing in a
[11777.29s -> 11782.73s]  mirror, just like looking huge and awesome. And somebody comes up behind him and like grabs him.
[11782.73s -> 11804.81s]  He's going to go, you can't, nobody looks cool that way. It's true. Oh, here it is.
[11805.61s -> 11808.81s]  I haven't. Okay. This is the electric. That's the electric. Oh no.
[11818.73s -> 11831.21s]  I love this game and stay down. I cannot believe you did this. I feel so much more at home.
[11833.37s -> 11840.49s]  I can't believe you shattered his computer. So he freaks out. You know, he's had that monitor for
[11840.49s -> 11857.06s]  like 15 years. Fun thing. It's a really cool thing. Why am I closed? Oh, it's a different day. I did
[11857.06s -> 11864.42s]  it over two days. I haven't been in here yet. Right. Why did I not break that? I should have
[11864.42s -> 11873.90s]  fucking known. Really? That's the point. That's why I'm doing this. See, cause I know that I was
[11873.90s -> 11884.04s]  there. Missed lore. Missed lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip
[11884.04s -> 11892.70s]  lore. Almost two more minutes of this. This guy's doing a really great job of doing the random voice
[11892.70s -> 11899.26s]  lines that play when you spawn for the first time in a league of legends game as a champion.
[11902.70s -> 11910.17s]  Fucked up medical stuff. You should have seen what the guy did. He flew up. I, I, the guy was
[11910.17s -> 11915.05s]  going this way and then he got magnetized his face to the wall and blood splattered. He's going
[11915.05s -> 11922.97s]  to be like, what the fuck are you talking about? I'm lost. I'm so lost. I don't know what any of this
[11922.97s -> 11926.81s]  means. I thought this was like a Google satellite image of like a warehouse and roads and stuff. I
[11926.81s -> 11935.72s]  was like, wait, where is that? Holy shit. How many times did I actually do this? It's just available
[11935.72s -> 11943.94s]  for me. So I do it. It's just a, it's just a thing that I know. You know what I mean? It's routine
[11945.43s -> 11950.63s]  in a game with scary jump scares and all kinds of weird fucked up enemies. This is routine for
[11950.63s -> 11968.02s]  me. It's comfortable. I can't believe I used to do that shit. Embarrassing. I remember when I
[11968.02s -> 11989.51s]  thought that was fun. Memories. It's like looking at an old photo. Should I just give this to the
[11989.51s -> 11996.50s]  doctor? You know, like should I feel like this is just, this should be in like the, in the
[11996.50s -> 12010.79s]  folder of stuff I bring. I mean, seriously, that was crap. I can't believe you did it.
[12010.79s -> 12024.73s]  That's, you had to go through like, what? 17, 16 hours of stuff to find it. God damn. Well,
[12024.73s -> 12033.70s]  we got it. This is Pokemon gold, Pokemon gold, silver crystal battle, the giant enemy spider.
[12034.50s -> 12039.94s]  This actually is a music file, but there is some video to go with it. I bet you can never guess
[12039.94s -> 12047.32s]  what it is. See, a lot of people didn't know that there was a boss battle of this,
[12048.52s -> 12106.47s]  the giant enemy spider. Remember when I did all this? Feels bad, man. Old YouTube. Yeah, you know,
[12108.09s -> 12114.17s]  memories, you know, when you're like looking at an old photograph.
[12114.81s -> 12136.52s]  How long can you keep it up for? How long can you do it for? It's like, it's like passing an old
[12136.52s -> 12163.62s]  fire extinguisher. This is where it's from. I've never played this game. Why would I have that in
[12163.62s -> 12176.14s]  my head for any reason? Probably Smash Brothers. Yeah, definitely Smash Brothers. This is where
[12176.14s -> 12196.98s]  they got the Pokemon song. This is where they got that Pokemon song, you know? Remix? Well, I mean,
[12196.98s -> 12205.58s]  I know, I mean, of course it's a remix. It's really good, though. Very, very fucking great job.
[12206.79s -> 12215.02s]  Giant enemy spider. This is a remake. Yeah, what do you think? This is more music here. This is,
[12215.02s -> 12220.38s]  well, technically kind of. This is Sea Shanty 2, but it's German's pirate marching band.
[12242.97s -> 12274.78s]  I never played RuneScape before. I know a lot of people love it. I never played it.
[12275.82s -> 12281.51s]  That was, I think, I don't know what, what's the, hold on, let's go over here for a second.
[12282.15s -> 12289.48s]  I mean, I know this part because, I mean, like LOL, right? But what happens here? What is,
[12289.48s -> 12294.52s]  what's going on in this image here? Am I not, is this character not supposed to be here?
[12295.48s -> 12304.02s]  Does it get killed by a dwarf? All right. Can someone explain RuneScape to me in a small,
[12304.82s -> 12312.46s]  like three words? Is it hard? Do you, when you die, you're dead? It's, it's RuneScape.
[12312.46s -> 12321.18s]  You see like people die in RuneScape and it's a huge problem or something. You lose all your
[12321.18s -> 12332.23s]  items when you die. Okay. Stream RuneScape. I don't know if I want to do that. You just literally
[12332.23s -> 12339.86s]  respawn. Oh, well, I always thought it was something, this is hardcore or something.
[12344.20s -> 12351.11s]  No, I don't have any, but I can't get into like another MMO. No way. You respawn, but without,
[12351.11s -> 12364.10s]  so it's like Minecraft. Okay. I get it. Come on. Next is, this is, this is a one second video.
[12364.10s -> 12367.14s]  I don't even know how you get a one second video. You can upload it to YouTube, but here it is.
[12367.22s -> 12381.19s]  Jerma eats a lunchable. Good. Jerma get mad, then do stunt.
[12398.86s -> 12400.22s]  What on earth just happened?
[12413.27s -> 12417.53s]  Jerma get mad, then do stunt. I get it. I guess it is just the title, huh?
[12420.57s -> 12428.39s]  Regular show. Changed clothes, mid throw. Oh man. These are, I fucking love these.
[12428.39s -> 12437.26s]  This is a new Bill Crazee video. Another Bill Crazee interpretation of footage.
[12460.34s -> 12464.50s]  I'm going to see how long I can last. It's going to hurt like a bitch. You know what I mean?
[12479.80s -> 12493.45s]  I love all the, all the Gary the fuck up videos and Bill Crazee videos because
[12494.41s -> 12498.73s]  they're all a little different somehow. Sometimes it's a pool. Sometimes it's a
[12499.29s -> 12504.65s]  beach. Sometimes it's a bathtub. They're always just slightly different to a point where I like
[12504.65s -> 12516.52s]  watching them. I can't just let a video get to the end because I have ADD and I have to like,
[12516.52s -> 12522.87s]  I have to get it right before it ends. I piss off so many of my friends if I watch videos and stuff.
[12522.87s -> 12526.87s]  I'm just like, oh, it's done. I'm done. I got to click it too. I know a lot of people do that shit.
[12527.51s -> 12533.11s]  I'm one of them. It's called Jerma Boulder. We'd best leave till the weather's better. The rain
[12533.11s -> 12559.53s]  loosened some of this rock. I think it's Boulder wanting us to go away. I missed that somehow.
[12561.85s -> 12578.23s]  Is that supposed to be from the AI dungeon stream? Here is a mad tyrant Jerma kills his subjects.
[12597.54s -> 12602.02s]  Everyone's kind of baby. So this, wait, does that mean that I've been killing babies?
[12602.58s -> 12610.44s]  I killed them all. Is that what that means? And not just the men, but oh shit, I've been killing
[12610.44s -> 12620.62s]  actual babies this whole time. I think we saw this one. My favorite part is the bonkabonkabonkash.
[12620.62s -> 12641.69s]  oh here's another and we have made it to the mostly music well there's a couple of videos
[12642.57s -> 12717.18s]  there we made another giant spider joke oh boy oh boy quick somebody make a remix
[12718.14s -> 12727.64s]  of this remix no no no no no no i don't i don't this is not what i wanted to go back how do i go
[12727.64s -> 12734.14s]  back is that just a four second video two years alone in the world why did that end no no no uh
[12734.94s -> 12746.49s]  i've lost my account okay somebody said that sour place is a shitty emote that's why i paused
[12746.49s -> 12751.29s]  somebody said dude sour place really like sucks somebody said that and i was like oh it does and
[12751.29s -> 12757.90s]  then i freaked out and i pressed the wrong button i don't know i don't i don't have an opinion of it
[12757.90s -> 12763.90s]  i think it's cool i guess doesn't i know it's cool it's cool back to back tracking barry coming up

[13503.11s -> 13509.27s]  should say part one community content night part two will be next weekend and then next weekend
[13509.27s -> 13516.38s]  we will be caught up completely to the uh last 30 days or so so we'll be caught up completely on

[13611.70s -> 13616.73s]  stream on tuesday and then what we'll probably end up doing is we're gonna do tuesday wednesday
[13616.73s -> 13623.29s]  thursday of this coming week we've got a lot of other stuff to play we're essentially gonna be
[13624.46s -> 13638.44s]  we're essentially just gonna go and tick stuff off the list when is the green screen after i get
[13639.16s -> 13647.70s]  a shot of nerve blocking steroids into my ribs and i don't have a time frame for that yet because
[13647.70s -> 13660.38s]  that's it's apparently what i'm gonna have to do if you if you missed if you don't know what
[13660.38s -> 13663.42s]  i'm talking about i was going to go back in front of the green screen because obviously
[13664.46s -> 13668.78s]  oh let me just change the scenes here because this is the end um i was gonna go back in front
[13668.78s -> 13676.14s]  of the green screen and do six more hours of green screen content right just because this
[13676.14s -> 13683.66s]  this shit is so funny you guys come up with so much stuff and it's and even still a full year
[13683.66s -> 13692.52s]  later these clips are still used and still put in funny places that you guys have just have you just
[13692.52s -> 13701.16s]  it never stops so i wanted to give way more footage for you guys to use but i've come down
[13701.16s -> 13707.62s]  with a strange medical condition where my core kind of around my all in the middle of my ribs
[13707.62s -> 13714.42s]  in the back uh in my spine and back and ribs and shit it hurts and my range of motion is limited
[13715.14s -> 13719.86s]  i mean i can still move around i'm fine but i can't like throw my arms around and fucking
[13719.86s -> 13724.50s]  run around and jump and land like i did my range of motion is smaller it's tighter now
[13725.64s -> 13730.44s]  and we're still trying to figure out exactly what's going on but they think that i have to get
[13731.08s -> 13734.68s]  i think i have costochondritis i mean i have a hernia which i've said before
[13735.40s -> 13739.88s]  but i might also have costochondritis which is inflammation in your rib cage and this really
[13739.88s -> 13743.56s]  you don't do anything to treat it there's there is no treatment it's just do a thing that makes
[13743.56s -> 13750.78s]  your body not hurt anymore which is steroids like an injection in your like ribs but i will cross
[13750.78s -> 13761.59s]  that bridge when i have to but i'm good i don't think it's not like every day i can't walk or
[13761.59s -> 13767.75s]  anything i'm fine completely but turning my body more than probably 30 or 40 degrees to the left
[13767.75s -> 13776.89s]  or right ah it hurts but that's the reason why i haven't done it yet kind of waiting on to get
[13776.89s -> 13782.70s]  all that i want 2020 is the year where i want to get truly back to health because i have been no
[13782.70s -> 13788.78s]  it's not that i have been eating unhealthy or being unhealthy my body has decided to at this stage
[13789.58s -> 13796.86s]  the last like year and a half or so is to sort of revolt so 2020 i really want to get healthy
[13796.86s -> 13803.98s]  again whether that's you know find treatment for the back and rib problems i want to get back into
[13803.98s -> 13809.82s]  being healthy and not necessarily oh i'm gonna go to the gym every day but just not kind of feel
[13809.82s -> 13817.13s]  like bumpy two three days a week you know i mean if that makes any sense but uh let's do the bits
[13819.43s -> 13822.71s]  thanks for watching again the community content nights are always really really fun for me
[13823.43s -> 13828.07s]  because we get to watch and enjoy all the funny things that everybody makes and all the great
[13829.27s -> 13838.26s]  artwork that you guys do a lot of talented funny people here and i love showcasing it and each one
[13838.26s -> 13844.76s]  of these is the third time we've done this well technically fifth time we've done this where my
[13844.76s -> 13854.54s]  face hurts from laughing at at least five to ten of these you know what i mean drink water i drink
[13854.54s -> 13861.18s]  a lot of water don't worry it's not the water but hey let's go back fitting gave 250 quick guys
[13861.18s -> 13867.62s]  do a hype train the hype train did happen i have increased the difficulty on it and if i'm gonna
[13867.62s -> 13873.26s]  bring it up to its maximum we'll see what happens after that but i appreciate it nonetheless
[13874.63s -> 13879.19s]  ocean dweller thanks for 250 germany you made it harder but people still kind of do it we're
[13879.19s -> 13883.83s]  just spending more money now the smart move is to make it super easy so people don't waste
[13883.83s -> 13892.52s]  as much and it's over faster just make it like five dollars so if we get to level five instantly
[13893.48s -> 13902.25s]  something about that is funny but i feel like it would be annoying after a couple days but i'll
[13902.25s -> 13910.34s]  try it i'll try that next room yeah i'll make it like five bucks till i get to level five or
[13910.34s -> 13927.54s]  something or i might just turn it off you know it doesn't have to be there but back on soy and
[13927.54s -> 13934.50s]  mcdonald's and fast food i don't really i don't really like soy i don't like soy milk i don't
[13934.50s -> 13941.08s]  really eat soy products i'm not a big soy fan i don't really take that much dairy besides a
[13941.08s -> 13949.13s]  little cheese every now and then and some yogurt but i drink almond milk i have replaced almond
[13949.13s -> 13958.97s]  milk 100 with everything else that is dairy wait you're you're you're a chat if you drink almond
[13958.97s -> 13969.53s]  milk is that how it works oh shout out to the 4 000 doctors in the chat yeah shout out to all
[13969.53s -> 13981.29s]  these doctors uh but yeah potion dweller i'll probably just get rid of it it's a fun thing
[13981.29s -> 13985.77s]  to do maybe i'll turn it on every once in a while but i'm probably not gonna have it on every day
[13985.77s -> 13990.09s]  we've been it's been around for about a week i'll probably i'll turn on like the hype train like
[13990.09s -> 13994.41s]  once every few weeks or something maybe if people really want to do that not every day

[14197.37s -> 14201.45s]  do you know what the record is for your longest stream ever have you ever legitimately thought
[14201.45s -> 14206.57s]  of doing a 24-hour stream and then love from the frigid wasteland of northern minnesota
[14207.45s -> 14215.24s]  the longest stream ever was 13 hours and it was uh five days ago it was the lord of the rings
[14215.24s -> 14220.26s]  the two towers it was 13 hours and 20 minutes or something that's an easy question because
[14220.26s -> 14226.02s]  it just happened i've never thought of doing a 24-hour stream because it's very unhealthy
[14226.92s -> 14234.34s]  it's not good unless you are switching off with people for instance if there was three or four
[14234.34s -> 14241.46s]  people that were doing like a charity thing or it's really just not healthy to sit in the same
[14241.46s -> 14248.98s]  spot for 24 hours or more it's just bad for you i don't i could i know i i i was exhausted
[14250.62s -> 14258.47s]  i was physically beaten after that 13-hour stream that adding twice that in a way that's
[14258.47s -> 14270.70s]  just no fun that's no fun would twitch let you sleep on stream if it was pre-approved
[14272.25s -> 14275.93s]  now probably not but maybe but at that point you're like not even streaming at that point
[14275.93s -> 14281.72s]  the clock is just ticking just so you can have a 24-hour stream you know what i mean it's like oh
[14281.72s -> 14288.28s]  yeah though i'm doing a 24-hour stream except i'm doing 13 and i'm going to just lie down
[14288.28s -> 14299.58s]  in bed for eight hours no it's unhealthy i don't want to i don't want to do it the longest you'll
[14299.58s -> 14310.94s]  ever see truly is something like 10 to 13 10 to 14 max you know you nobody you can't you're not
[14310.94s -> 14318.38s]  supposed to just like sit down like that and just stare at us monitor 15 hours it's really just bad
[14318.38s -> 14331.40s]  for you go get a standing desk i don't think i don't want to stand for 15 or 14 hours
[14334.68s -> 14339.40s]  you need to as humans you got to move around you get i mean you if i was going to do a 24-hour
[14339.40s -> 14346.62s]  stream every every like two to three hours i would take like a 30-minute break but then that's you
[14346.62s -> 14353.24s]  know it's just not even at some point you're just doing it just to say you did it which i don't
[14353.24s -> 14363.16s]  really care but no no plans to ever do it dad regal thanks for the 250 i'm sick and tired of
[14363.16s -> 14367.64s]  all the bugleberry hate bugle boys across the nation are rising up and we're not taking it
[14367.64s -> 14375.96s]  anymore i am a bugleberry fan fight for the screams of every man all right can we get some
[14375.96s -> 14382.46s]  support here back and thanks for the 250 hey germa glad i could catch the stream after my 10
[14382.46s -> 14388.20s]  day stay at the hospital missed you so much that i had dreams of you streaming just random games
[14388.20s -> 14397.24s]  like mario odyssey and league of legends anyways keep doing you i'm not sure exactly what you're
[14397.24s -> 14403.80s]  doing in the hospital but hopefully you're good to go that is a wild dream to have considering
[14403.80s -> 14411.42s]  that i will never play league of legends on this channel i did make a league of legends video
[14412.30s -> 14425.26s]  but it wasn't it was grandpa it was me walking into towers that was it yanwen thanks for the
[14425.26s -> 14430.38s]  1500 bits 15 dollars from yanwen grima i know your face quite well i can teach you how to
[14430.38s -> 14436.38s]  draw i'm certain of it i'm unteachable nobody can teach me how to draw i can't even hold a pencil
[14436.38s -> 14443.34s]  right i don't have the patience for it i will draw six or seven lines and then be like i'm done i'm
[14443.34s -> 14446.94s]  done i can't i gotta get up and like scream i can't do it i can't do it i have no patience
[14447.58s -> 14455.61s]  i have no patience with it i can't sit there like do it no not gonna happen no i can't do it i can't
[14455.61s -> 14461.69s]  do it i can't do it i can't do it i can't do it no i can't no i can't do it i can't do it i can't
[14461.69s -> 14471.10s]  do it you have an art degree no i don't have an art degree i have the i didn't know what to pick
[14471.10s -> 14486.47s]  for a minor in college and art sounded like the most interesting liar you tilt brush vr i was
[14486.47s -> 14491.51s]  gonna it was on the list until i stopped doing vr again once i get this bullshit under control
[14491.51s -> 14500.04s]  that's one of the plans to go back to vr too but thank you yanwen you are incredibly talented
[14500.60s -> 14509.48s]  so please hire me as your art tutor i need a job seriously i can't do it i've tried i've had so many
[14509.48s -> 14518.31s]  people try i've had so many people attempt and then i just like i don't have time for it anymore
[14518.95s -> 14536.46s]  but this is a great picture let's put it on don't listen to chat you really can't do it
[14538.49s -> 14547.00s]  granko uh thanks thanks granko is trying to be realistic with me you learned pottery for a joke
[14548.52s -> 14553.88s]  yeah but that's different though you look at how how hard this is to do it takes a ton of time
[14554.76s -> 14560.18s]  i don't have i don't have time i don't have time this is fantastic image though yanwen seriously
[14561.61s -> 14572.98s]  killing it like always we also had 500 bits from siku 500 subs curls
[14573.78s -> 14579.62s]  you can't do curls anymore dummy bear thanks for the 500 bits glad to catch the live stream for
[14579.62s -> 14587.96s]  once glad to have you here thank you oh up upster narwhal thanks for the 300 bits
[14588.76s -> 14593.42s]  hey germa i donated last night about the germa auto emote and got a question for you
[14594.06s -> 14598.78s]  why are emotes not allowed for community content night is there an emote contest coming up soon i
[14598.78s -> 14604.86s]  have more 50 plus emotes on bttv and a hundred total that i've made over the past few months
[14605.66s -> 14615.43s]  you have just described the reason why that is the exact reason why because there's a lot
[14616.15s -> 14621.43s]  and if emotes there would be there would be an entire probably two to three hour section for
[14621.43s -> 14633.06s]  emotes what has happened in the recent months is they're discord emotes i will probably not
[14633.06s -> 14640.76s]  do an official community emote contest again for a while but what we've decided is open up
[14640.76s -> 14654.79s]  emotes for discord but that's kind of the plan for that the discord ones are cool like bits
[14655.67s -> 14666.17s]  yeah there's like a hundred emotes slots yeah but you you gotta remember for me just because it
[14666.17s -> 14671.77s]  exists doesn't mean i want to have them you know what i mean i want new emotes to be
[14674.97s -> 14679.13s]  important and different and i just did you oh well you got a hundred slots just upload a hundred
[14679.13s -> 14684.09s]  emotes i want them to all have their own individual value and not just throw up like
[14684.09s -> 14696.52s]  30 or 40 new emotes just because i have them and i know that germa tv exists but that was a community
[14696.52s -> 14703.02s]  emote you have a hundred slots actually i haven't even looked i don't know i actually i have no idea
[14703.02s -> 14705.98s]  how many slots i have and i don't want to look because i don't want to be i don't want to be
[14705.98s -> 14715.99s]  like embarrassed emotes to me are did was there something so significant that we thought was
[14715.99s -> 14724.57s]  interesting that it needs to be a way to express as a picture you know what i'm saying or just like
[14724.57s -> 14735.70s]  randomly something funny that happens i and it needs to have the test of time too because yes
[14735.70s -> 14742.18s]  i could have 50 different emotes of the same image but like a small change to my face
[14743.88s -> 14755.19s]  but i don't really want to do that discord emote slots oh that would be funny though
[14755.75s -> 14760.34s]  to the planets they're all very important to me there's only like one or two that aren't done
[14766.71s -> 14771.51s]  5g germa and germa psycho are the next ones because they've the test of time is there
[14772.63s -> 14778.86s]  there it is you need to be sure they can stand the test of time we don't want another bald coin
[14779.50s -> 14793.14s]  it's the most requested but no to answer your question community content night
[14794.10s -> 14797.78s]  emotes would just take up so much time and so many people would just submit them and then
[14798.82s -> 14801.86s]  afterwards it's like all right well why don't you why don't you have you have to add those now
[14802.50s -> 14806.90s]  it's like well we just looked at 150 emotes how i'm just gonna i can't
[14807.94s -> 14829.61s]  it's plating the stocks of bld don't use it buy now but we'll see that look all these things
[14829.61s -> 14834.97s]  are subject to change always because i'm gonna bump you here for a second because i don't know
[14834.97s -> 14839.77s]  that this as the channel gets larger and there's more and more people here there's more and more
[14839.77s -> 14845.45s]  things that need to be tweaked and changed and this is not the channel it was two years ago
[14846.65s -> 14852.01s]  it's a lot more people a lot more stuff going on you know i'm saying it the streams might be
[14852.01s -> 14857.21s]  very similar but the channel has changed a little like we've we brought on so many more people
[14857.85s -> 14869.43s]  this motherfucker's gone corporate we have the same emotes from two years ago
[14869.43s -> 14882.01s]  yeah we also have ones from this year like last year too corporate influencer it's all subject
[14882.01s -> 14890.98s]  to change it really is e-clown but thank you magpie for the 500 bits apparently the 3d
[14890.98s -> 14896.82s]  movie maker rat is named the breeze the wiki also has rocco from rocco's modern life for whatever
[14896.82s -> 14902.98s]  fucking reason but that's because there was a nickelodeon 3d movie maker extension add on
[14902.98s -> 14912.01s]  there is a nickelodeon 3d movie maker it exists it's the exact same game but with ren stimpy
[14912.09s -> 14925.83s]  tommy pickles and rocco and shit you need to stream that no bugleberry emote well the i mean
[14925.83s -> 14936.84s]  the book's still out on bugleberry i'm still gauging that one but yeah they had they do have
[14936.84s -> 14949.10s]  name another maple thanks for the 300 bits i just say love you jeremy thank you gray the color thanks
[14949.10s -> 14953.98s]  with 300 bits jeremy you look legitimately handsome whenever you smile and nod anyone calling you a
[14953.98s -> 14959.90s]  smalting goblin is talking pure shit you're like legitimately fucking good looking also
[14959.90s -> 14965.82s]  moo crew makes drew crew eat poopoo i did yeah i wouldn't say pissy shitty but i would say
[14965.82s -> 14973.05s]  drew crew eat poopoo so that just shows how i how i'm much of a fucking hypocrite i am
[14976.54s -> 14982.63s]  thank you though thank you tar alecran for the 253 it's time to talk about your being you're an
[14982.71s -> 14995.74s]  alcoholic it's a clip from earlier what is it what is it what do you mean i drink i drink
[14996.70s -> 14999.50s]  whatever i want to drink out of any cup that i can get
[15002.01s -> 15007.13s]  but what's wrong with that i drink whatever i want to drink out of any cup that i can get
[15009.70s -> 15015.70s]  what's wrong with that if you have just if you have like a coffee mug that's clean and you
[15015.70s -> 15027.22s]  want to drink a glass of wine put it in the coffee mug who cares is that it doesn't really
[15027.22s -> 15038.04s]  matter it's just a container that holds liquid nobody's seeing me do i'm just you know if i was
[15038.04s -> 15045.91s]  sitting here having a glass of wine out of of coffee mug no but none of you even would know
[15045.91s -> 15054.46s]  i was doing that unless the face cam was on so it's like what i need to show you my like cool
[15054.46s -> 15065.69s]  elaborate 40 dollar wine glass no and plus like i have the ninja turtle sippy cups are a godsend
[15065.69s -> 15073.42s]  because i can drop them and be fine you know what happens if you drop a glass of wine on the ground
[15074.46s -> 15083.26s]  it shatters glass goes everywhere and you ruin your floor forever if you drop a sippy cup with
[15083.26s -> 15092.79s]  wine in it on the ground it bounces nothing happens and you pick it up now explain to me
[15092.79s -> 15105.16s]  which one is this crazy person explain to me which who's the weirdo there it ain't me
[15106.12s -> 15120.10s]  it ain't me tar alecran thanks for the 252 i'm on top of your 253 please don't waste your time
[15120.10s -> 15125.22s]  watching a thousand hours of jojo's adventure the only reason people like that nonsense
[15125.86s -> 15129.38s]  is because they get stockholm syndrome through watching it for so long
[15130.34s -> 15135.22s]  watch ping pong it's literally the greatest show animated or otherwise to ever grace this earth
[15135.22s -> 15151.64s]  and it's only 11 episodes trust me i'm like a 100 month sub he's right he's right about it he's
[15151.64s -> 15162.78s]  right about ping pong actually true what's ping pong ping pong is actually fucking great don't

[15216.82s -> 15230.12s]  of the rings if i gotta be able to watch the whole show in less than 20 to 30 hours like 25
[15230.12s -> 15237.83s]  hours for a whole show like that's 22 minutes in length 30 minutes per episode is not 500 that's
[15237.83s -> 15249.43s]  a lie it's like 80 episodes not 500 oh well it's not 25 you buffoon wait why am i a buffoon
[15249.43s -> 15255.99s]  people are just lying to me hey how many episodes i i'm asking i asked a question

[15647.93s -> 15652.65s]  resolution i wanted to be a better at drawing because of great communities like this one a lot
[15652.65s -> 15657.13s]  of it is just practice even if you're not satisfied with the quality you can always just keep practicing
[15657.13s -> 15665.77s]  and improving this is very true but also keep in mind that i spend a significant amount of time
[15668.47s -> 15675.70s]  doing this and even when the stream's not on a lot of my free time is based around this stream
[15676.50s -> 15679.38s]  and trying to improve it and try to make new streams and try to
[15681.08s -> 15688.04s]  big projects and try to get contacts with people and this is kind of this is my this is like what
[15688.04s -> 15695.19s]  i do instead of something like art and i think if i really really tried to dump dozens and dozens
[15695.19s -> 15700.07s]  and dozens of hours into something like learning how to draw it would kind of cut into the time
[15700.07s -> 15707.88s]  that i would want to spend working on stuff for the stream and i care very much about it
[15710.09s -> 15726.87s]  this do an art stream uh no no i can't i can't i love art i love art but i i'd rather be a
[15726.87s -> 15732.90s]  observer than a participant that makes any sense it does it makes perfect sense i say that a lot
