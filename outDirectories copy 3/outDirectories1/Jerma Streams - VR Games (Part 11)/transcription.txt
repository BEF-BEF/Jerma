[6.58s -> 15.00s]  Hello, Perk. You guys asked for holo. There we go, now you should be able to hear me.
[15.72s -> 28.14s]  How you doing? If you're wondering about the mic change, it's because I'm using the index micro-
[28.14s -> 39.85s]  is it quiet? Let me turn it up. What is that? I wasn't wondering. Ow? What do you mean ow?
[40.57s -> 49.21s]  I just punched- oh shit, that's gonna happen, isn't it? All the time. I needed- all right, listen.
[50.60s -> 69.19s]  I needed freedom in my space, okay? In that room is my office. It's too cramped in there. I had to
[69.19s -> 79.03s]  upgrade my space, and that means bringing my entire computer setup, monitors, tower, keyboard,
[80.55s -> 86.84s]  into my fucking living room. So I would have streamed like three days ago,
[87.72s -> 95.38s]  because it wasn't feeling well. I had diarrhea. Bad. But I brought my entire computer into my
[95.38s -> 104.14s]  living room, so I couldn't do anything. So I just let it run its course. I think I'm okay today,
[104.14s -> 114.49s]  I hope so. We'll find out. You and I are going to find out very shortly if I've got to run away,
[115.29s -> 124.07s]  which I hope doesn't happen. And by the way, this is- the mic's going to sound a little better.
[124.07s -> 139.48s]  I'm holding- look, I'm just gonna go live, whatever. Okay, listen. Got an index. Oh my god!
[140.28s -> 146.09s]  Hey, look what I got for Christmas! I got an index! And I tripped over the wire and fucking
[146.09s -> 161.59s]  ate it. I have an index now, and I can't- how's my hair? Probably do. What do you mean? What?
[161.59s -> 170.63s]  No, it's because the mic- the webcam's like up on a thing. Like I have like a- I embedded it into
[170.63s -> 183.30s]  the fucking wall. I'm gonna trip over this guy, I know it. We're gonna play Boneworks first. So,
[183.30s -> 194.89s]  yeah, you'll hear me better when the headset's on. It looks beautiful. I can see you guys in here.
[194.89s -> 198.25s]  I'm just delaying it, because I hate getting into this fucking thing, because once I get in here,
[198.25s -> 202.97s]  I know that I'm gonna lose 400 or 500 hairs off the front of my head. That's why I don't like
[202.97s -> 211.21s]  doing this. I'm just like- I'm just making sure you guys have an image of me with an extra 400
[211.21s -> 219.67s]  here. Right in the front. I'm probably cutting out what I want. Sure, that I have hairs on the top
[219.67s -> 233.24s]  of my head, right? Is that what it sounds like? That's probably what it sounds like. Bobby? Also,
[234.28s -> 240.94s]  what do I hope that this looks okay? Because what I've been told is the index has a higher
[240.94s -> 247.42s]  field of view than all the other ones. By the way, pog. But it can make capturing it kind of
[247.42s -> 255.54s]  a pain in the ass. So, I have three different capture modes on this thing. I feel like I'm
[255.54s -> 262.02s]  working on a fucking sink with somebody. And they're down there. Yeah, so move two or three
[262.02s -> 268.84s]  inches to the right. The screws are right there. God, that was a pretty good joke. Am I going in?
[268.84s -> 279.08s]  I'm going in. I can see you guys in here. Let me get this on right. And I got that thing. Where am
[279.08s -> 292.95s]  I? My hands aren't on there. Hold on. There you are. What are you saying? What is your room like?
[292.95s -> 303.14s]  What? I gotta get I got these I look at these things. Tiny hands. I don't have to what do I
[303.14s -> 308.15s]  have big fucking hands. My hands are actually embarrassingly large. I hate it. I don't I don't
[308.15s -> 318.01s]  why do I have to log in? All right. This. This just reminded me of I know this is a joke. But
[318.01s -> 323.13s]  for a second, I was fucking furious. Because I thought this was like, like origin or something
[323.13s -> 327.13s]  like you got to log into origin before you play the game. I was about to get really, really mad.
[327.13s -> 336.15s]  That room makes me look tiny. It's a gigantic fucking living room. Yeah, you know who else looks
[336.15s -> 342.30s]  small you when you take all the furniture out of your living room, all the couch, the chairs,
[342.30s -> 348.10s]  the TVs, everything, you move your entire desktop into the center of the room. You probably got
[348.10s -> 354.92s]  going to look six feet tall anymore. It's up. I swear your cameras blurry. Oh, shit, I actually
[354.92s -> 357.48s]  forgot. You're right. You're right. Good. Good. I'm going to stall as long as I want because
[357.48s -> 394.90s]  once I get in, you know, we're good for like, we want to change the camera. You guys can't even
[394.90s -> 401.10s]  hear me. I've been talking shit for like a minute straight and nobody can hear me. I've just been
[401.10s -> 407.82s]  over there just just like talking shit. Nobody could hear it. Oh, what did I just say? It was
[407.82s -> 414.28s]  such it was like a good I said it was a whatever. Oh, right. Auto focus. Why the fuck do people put
[414.28s -> 420.52s]  auto focuses on a webcam doesn't move it in the same exact place you don't move you physically
[420.52s -> 451.98s]  don't move. Ready? Pretty good. Oh, shut up. I need to wear it. Otherwise, my doctor is going
[451.98s -> 463.93s]  to be mad that I did this today. All right, here we go. What does this say? Where's my center? There
[463.93s -> 472.63s]  we are. Hold on. Boneworks attention bonework subroutine operates on highly experimental
[472.63s -> 476.55s]  simulated physics. My pants are going to come down at some point during the stream.
[477.51s -> 488.28s]  It's nice and tight. Look at that. Oh, he's got an index. Oh, dude, he's got an index. What?
[490.44s -> 507.19s]  You can't do that unless you have one. Okay, I think I'm ready. Expert VR users only.
[512.36s -> 521.00s]  Finally, the penis stream. Please identify your real world height. They think I'm five nine. See?
[521.88s -> 526.52s]  Oh, look at how small you look in your room. I think it thinks I'm five nine. This is a
[526.52s -> 531.42s]  this is a big living room. That's not how tall we really are. So let's make it accurate.
[534.86s -> 545.75s]  Expert mode. Average height. Am I on the camera from over here? Make sure I'm in the right spot.
[545.75s -> 555.61s]  Can you guys still see me? Yeah, that's fine. I'm gonna be that's a cute look. I can go like
[555.61s -> 559.13s]  I can fucking go like this today. You know what I mean? I couldn't do that in the other room.
[559.21s -> 568.04s]  I'm gonna be standing. Are you sure? I don't know why that just said attention. Try seated mode if
[568.04s -> 575.19s]  you have a soul. Like wait, what do you mean? Like a soul? I'm soulless? I'm I'm not concerned
[575.19s -> 589.24s]  about my real world surroundings. I'm gonna be fine. Wait, what? Is your floor okay? Yeah,
[589.24s -> 599.29s]  yeah, that's fine. Soulless Andy. I think that looks all right. Administrator privileges granted.
[599.29s -> 603.77s]  Confirm measurements to proceed. You want to know the best part about the index? I know you're gonna
[603.77s -> 607.53s]  hear that. Look, by the way, I need to make a really this is a real warning for the stream.
[609.72s -> 615.48s]  The real warning for the stream is I'm going to punch myself in the face probably twice.
[615.48s -> 622.41s]  I'm gonna say two or three times. I am using the the index mic. So I am really sorry if all
[622.41s -> 626.49s]  of a sudden you hear like an explosion because I punched myself directly in the eyes. I'm just
[626.49s -> 642.01s]  saying it's possible. All looks fine. Yeah, save settings. Stress level zero. Boneworks.
[644.68s -> 648.84s]  So that I need to be aware of that because I put that on the ground so I don't get like killed in
[648.84s -> 657.11s]  here. That's like where I'm safe. As long as I'm like in this area, as long as I'm in this zone here,
[658.14s -> 672.98s]  I am safe. Okay, should I do anything? I'm not even capturing this. So who cares? This is loud
[672.98s -> 700.30s]  too. I gotta drop this. All right, that's better. Okay, new game story. Is this zipper down? Why
[700.30s -> 703.50s]  are we watching a movie? By the way, I haven't done this yet. I want to do this.
[704.84s -> 730.06s]  I want to watch a movie in VR and pretend like I have like a 500 inch screen. Movie night. Oh,
[730.06s -> 734.63s]  I can skip this. No, don't skip. By the way, this is the middle of my room. I'm not even like on
[734.63s -> 745.03s]  camera. I might need to recalibrate that. Should I skip the movie? No, I'm not going to skip the
[745.03s -> 762.12s]  movie. I don't know. Look, it's quiet. Why can't I do a peace sign? It doesn't look right. What's
[762.12s -> 779.69s]  wrong with my hands? They calibrate themselves. Object. Coffee cup. Indestructible.
[785.66s -> 796.52s]  Skip the shit out of me. I thought I was too far away. Coffee cup. Oh, that felt good. These
[796.52s -> 810.04s]  are cool. These are cool. That's fun. I have barely played with this, by the way. All right,
[810.04s -> 823.11s]  wait. Put it in the archive. Like I've barely done like this. Oh, it's weird though. I'm not.
[823.75s -> 833.74s]  Actually, do I pick things up like this? I think I do. Shit, it's kind of hard to get used to.
[834.70s -> 846.52s]  What? No, pick it up. Stick my pinky out. This is freaking me out. Oh my God. This is so easy.
[848.74s -> 864.01s]  Oh my God. It's so easy. All right. Disposal. It's so weird to do this. Honest to God. I feel
[864.09s -> 870.97s]  like I'm stuck on this. I know it's like I just have to use my hands the way that they normally
[870.97s -> 896.70s]  are but still put it in the gammon. I got a better idea. All right. Let go. Oh, I was holding on to
[896.70s -> 929.38s]  it. Skip the shit out of me. I didn't let it go. How do you jump? All right. I'm listening.
[931.00s -> 950.87s]  Because I didn't let it go. All right. Where do I go? Do it. There we go. How's the audio? We good?
[954.42s -> 956.82s]  Before I get really started here, I want to make sure you guys can hear me and shit.
[957.54s -> 967.77s]  We good? All right. Let's fucking go. Snap turn, crouch, locomotion. Oh, I don't need that. Look at
[967.77s -> 976.10s]  this. You think I need a snap turn? You think I need a snap turn? Can't do this in the other
[976.10s -> 992.73s]  fucking room. It's fun. It's a brick. I'm keeping this and I'm going to smash this on somebody's
[992.73s -> 1004.94s]  fucking head in like two minutes. Our minds are directly connected to the void. Bone works.
[1008.02s -> 1014.76s]  There's some kind of diamond. Why am I holding this like a jeweler? If you die in real life,
[1014.76s -> 1029.27s]  do you die in the void? Probably. We're gonna fucking imagine that that's your head. Okay.
[1029.27s -> 1046.57s]  We're good. Pizza? What? Nobody throw. I can't throw with my left hand. Okay. You want to see?
[1047.37s -> 1054.70s]  That's right hand. Perfect, right? Let's try left hand.
[1059.61s -> 1063.77s]  How come we don't teach that in school? You know what I mean? Why don't we like teach people to be
[1063.77s -> 1070.60s]  both left and right dominated? You know what I mean? We should teach that because everybody
[1070.60s -> 1078.26s]  just uses the same hand for everything. Give me that. I want the fucking coffee cup.
[1078.82s -> 1094.44s]  How would you get this in real life? Not bad. Let's go.
[1109.11s -> 1121.10s]  Just wait. I'm fucking ready. Why am I crouching? Stand up. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with
[1121.10s -> 1138.97s]  my character? Why am I stop crouching? There we go. What does it say? All right. What? Oh, I got a
[1138.97s -> 1150.39s]  gun? Okay. Uh, 10 PM. Willie Arthur Ford was seen eating lunch in the anomalous object disposal
[1150.39s -> 1156.15s]  break room. Well, I'll sit on a, he's on a break, check his time, whatever. Like I probably could,
[1156.15s -> 1168.42s]  should I take this? I probably need this. Can I use this computer? No, I want, I could have fly
[1168.42s -> 1196.76s]  paper all over me. Let's go. How do I walk? I can't walk. Fix your webcam. What's wrong with it?
[1196.76s -> 1214.71s]  What's wrong with it? Yeah, I'll move it up. I'll just give me a minute. Okay. Key card, right?
[1215.27s -> 1237.08s]  Where's the key card go? Security director. All right. Key card. Oh, don't do that. Got these,
[1238.04s -> 1248.50s]  these fucking hotel keys. We got bags here. Honey, go, um, go to the front desk and find out what the
[1248.50s -> 1261.61s]  fuck is going on. Stupid fucking hotel key. What was that? Out of frame. All right. Let me fix it
[1261.61s -> 1264.33s]  right now. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me get, let me do it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
[1264.33s -> 1283.30s]  All right. I'm just going to turn it this way a little bit. Is that better? That's probably better,
[1283.30s -> 1301.11s]  right? How's that? That's probably good. Game audio is low. It doesn't, it looks like it's pretty
[1301.11s -> 1314.20s]  high. All right. Let's go. This looks good. I have a normal house. I almost just fucking pulled the
[1314.20s -> 1328.39s]  whole, the whole tower down. Did I? No. Holy shit. That was terrifying. All right. Let's go. If I
[1328.39s -> 1332.54s]  need to move it a little more, I will. I think it's in a good spot though. All right. You don't
[1332.54s -> 1337.42s]  have any idea. I'm so excited to play with these and I heard that this was the thing to play.
[1338.14s -> 1342.54s]  I'm going to milk it. You know what I mean? I'm going to milk the fuck out of this.
[1345.48s -> 1349.32s]  Oh, I didn't tell you my favorite part about the Vive. It's not the Vive. Fucking sorry about that.
[1349.32s -> 1355.40s]  It's an index. So my absolute favorite part about this whole thing is these headphones.
[1356.04s -> 1362.36s]  Holy shit. They're open ear headphones. I can have these on. I can hear everything around me. I can
[1362.36s -> 1367.08s]  see everything around me. It's unbelievable. It's the best feature of the entire Vive by far.
[1368.20s -> 1381.08s]  Holy shit. It's unbelievable. Mega milk. All right. I feel like I'm going to need this
[1381.08s -> 1386.94s]  and I'm going to need to go to Rick. Where am I? Okay. Look, here's another thing. I'm scared to
[1386.94s -> 1392.70s]  be in a big open space because I feel like it's more dangerous for me to be in a huge open space
[1392.70s -> 1399.66s]  because I'm not scared to go like this. But I lost the key card. But I feel like that's even
[1399.66s -> 1403.50s]  worse because I'm going to run through my wall like a Looney Tunes cartoon. You understand?
[1408.44s -> 1413.56s]  You're nude. What are you talking about? My pants down? I'm wearing an abdomen chest brace
[1413.56s -> 1422.81s]  thing. So it's probably what you see. I'm still out of frame. It's not perfect. I have a big room
[1422.81s -> 1434.42s]  here. Okay. Snap right turn. Yeah, I know. Oh my God. Yep. No, I want this. Oh, you got to be
[1434.42s -> 1455.42s]  fucking kidding me, bro. I want to keep this. I'm going to start a fight.
[1456.14s -> 1480.74s]  Game with us. Monogon. What happened? What? Oh, I think I was supposed to turn that off.
[1482.57s -> 1509.53s]  Oops. Don't do it. It's over the face. Oh my God. Is there a baseball mini game?
[1510.57s -> 1514.57s]  Is there a baseball mini game? I'm asking you a question. Is there a baseball mini game?
[1520.20s -> 1539.72s]  No. Oh well. These aren't buttons. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, don't open. Don't open. Don't
[1539.72s -> 1560.15s]  open. No, don't open. I have to do like a Bloodborne or Dark Souls thing. Oh, that was wicked funny.
[1570.71s -> 1594.47s]  This is so fun to throw stuff. Is it going in? Oh, what's with this fucking immersion?
[1594.47s -> 1608.09s]  Nice. I have a cool immersion. Is this supposed to be happening? Critic Andy.
[1610.12s -> 1628.34s]  I think we don't have full body tracking. Check my zipper. I don't have a zipper. These are
[1628.34s -> 1640.41s]  fucking like workout pants. I think my pants have been down. Holy shit. What? No, they're not.
[1651.96s -> 1659.78s]  Can you guys see me? No. Yeah, my pants are like coming down. Whatever. Fuck it. It feels like
[1659.78s -> 1669.06s]  I'm wearing a diaper. Yeah, there's like my underwear down. I think my underwear is like here.
[1669.78s -> 1677.56s]  How is that possible? Oh damn, my VR too much. My underwear came down, but my pants didn't.
[1677.56s -> 1696.58s]  That doesn't make no sense. Opening day. Stop that. Let that gut breathe. No, I can't.
[1697.54s -> 1700.42s]  Do you guys probably think I'm wearing this because I'm trying to hide
[1701.46s -> 1707.70s]  like my Attack on Titan, Titan stomach. I'm not. I'm wearing it to support my fucking chest bones.
[1708.34s -> 1733.03s]  Prepare for the future. Okay. Am I still in the tutorial? Menu, grab, snap, turn. I already did
[1733.03s -> 1758.23s]  this. Oh, there's a jump. Okay. There we go. Touch. Honey, can you see it yet? Can you see the porn
[1758.31s -> 1785.96s]  channel yet? God damn it. I'm trying. It's still all blurry. Okay. Yeah, that's a turn. I get it.
[1785.96s -> 1814.09s]  Hold on. How do I run? Oh, okay. Just hold it. This is Minecraft. So like in 500 years, are we
[1814.09s -> 1820.01s]  going to be, are the aliens going to think that we were Minecraft characters? People play too much.
[1822.89s -> 1827.21s]  It's Roblox. Like that's what, that's what the aliens are going to think humans are.
[1827.77s -> 1833.50s]  Because we're just, we're just going to be playing Minecraft forever. No, it's not.
[1833.50s -> 1841.11s]  Which is, I mean, the game's fucking phenomenal. So I could understand.
[1850.44s -> 1860.07s]  Like a museum. And there's a guy just like, why? I don't even need to see this shit.
[1862.09s -> 1869.26s]  It's double stick to run. Oh, that's helpful. Thank you. All right. Let's ruin the experience
[1869.26s -> 1888.33s]  for everybody here and just play both at the same time. Cool. What about this one? Whatever.
[1890.09s -> 1896.89s]  That was cool. Museum. That was fun. All right. Now what? Here comes the gift shop.
[1896.89s -> 1909.02s]  App for a quick hop. That guy's 800 rounds. Jump while crouching for a huge leap.
[1911.34s -> 1930.89s]  Okay. So it's Luigi from Mario 2. Got it. That's fine. Wait, crouch. Oh, did I make it? I did it.
[1930.89s -> 1946.84s]  All right. We're good. All right. That was fun. terrain can be crossed by running and jumping.
[1947.56s -> 1954.20s]  Why does everybody do that in every TV show and movie? Whenever there's a big jump, the
[1954.20s -> 1961.32s]  character always does that. They go like this. That doesn't do anything. Get into a fucking ball.
[1961.32s -> 1966.50s]  I told you it was going to happen. I'm sorry. But get in tight jump and then get tight like
[1966.50s -> 1979.77s]  a fucking goddamn cannonball. You'll move. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I just impressed the fuck out of
[1979.77s -> 1996.62s]  like half of you. Half of you. Climbing. Oh, wait, can I? Ow. That hurts so bad.
[1996.62s -> 2013.67s]  Let go. I'm not even holding it. All right. To save additional items, place them in the platform.
[2013.67s -> 2020.58s]  All right. Let's go like this. I thought that was my face. I was like, why does it have that?
[2020.58s -> 2026.50s]  Because look at the background. It looks like a webcam room. I was like, I don't have a goatee.
[2027.14s -> 2032.76s]  I was like, where's that from? All right. Yeah. Save manually if you want to. Let's go.
[2033.56s -> 2040.81s]  I have this sweat coming down my ass. I think I have to take off this brace. It's like making
[2040.81s -> 2070.84s]  me fucking sweat. They're making like, whoa. It's like going to the McDonald's play place
[2070.84s -> 2076.22s]  and thinking you're like the man for being able to do that. Sorry. I'm facing the right way now.
[2076.22s -> 2126.65s]  What the fuck? Get out of the way. Oh, this is brick. You know it. Come on. Oh, heavy. Oh,
[2126.65s -> 2139.13s]  this is heavy. Very cool. So much can break. So much it can break. Interactable handles
[2139.13s -> 2144.49s]  and grab points can be found in the environment. Sure. Okay. Don't be too aggressive. Oh,
[2149.50s -> 2164.82s]  holy shit. Ooh. It's like all the kids at the fucking playground. They all have like the ball
[2164.82s -> 2172.10s]  and they're like, pull it harder. Harder. And finally an adult looks over and is like, no,
[2172.10s -> 2176.02s]  no, no, no, no. And one of the kids gets it right in the fucking face and flies.
[2185.82s -> 2201.72s]  There's a wall. Didn't hit it. I don't care. Only hero objects can be grabbed from a distance. Okay.
[2209.83s -> 2238.06s]  God damn it. They need to be thinner. That's fun just to do that. Move heavy objects slowly.
[2242.66s -> 2246.42s]  All right. I don't know why. Did anybody just feel like what I was just doing right there was
[2246.42s -> 2251.22s]  one of those like zombie iPad game ads where it's like all of a sudden that person's like,
[2251.22s -> 2255.14s]  oh yeah, cooking a burger. And then it's like, ah, they start running wicked fast and fucking
[2255.14s -> 2269.51s]  zombies start attacking. That's how I just felt like it was happening. Dude, I get so many ads
[2269.51s -> 2295.64s]  on Twitter. These are, that's hard to do. Watch that form, bro. Okay. This is just like a little
[2295.64s -> 2302.01s]  playground in this game. Well, I'm not going to spoil anything. Where am I going? I'm over here.
[2302.01s -> 2310.14s]  This is double deer. This thing's like squeeze. This thing has a tongue and it squeezes out people.
[2310.14s -> 2335.13s]  Oh my God. I'm going to Indiana Jones myself. Should I jump up there? Where am I? Should I
[2335.13s -> 2353.30s]  jump up here? Oh, I got it. All right. I did it. Get on top of this. What the fuck?
[2358.01s -> 2377.46s]  Whatever. Crouch that this thing's gotta come off. Even if like my like chest muscles hurt and my
[2377.46s -> 2396.34s]  like back hurts. This thing I'm wearing like a sweat belt. It's coming off. Press it. Oh,
[2396.34s -> 2418.73s]  companion cube. I know. All right. Hold on. Where are you? Hold on a sec. I'm taking this thing off.
[2418.81s -> 2428.17s]  It sounds like I'm wearing a diaper. Hold on to guys. I just got to change my diaper really quick.
[2428.17s -> 2444.15s]  Okay. That's better. That thing is just too much. Oh, how are we doing? Okay. I need to do this.
[2444.15s -> 2452.34s]  That thing is the best. This is OVR advanced settings. It's that thing tells you how many
[2452.34s -> 2461.82s]  times you've spun around. Awesome. Okay. Exhibit under construction. Let's go. I feel like this is
[2461.82s -> 2468.26s]  a TF2 map, right? Don't you just feel like you're going to see like soldiers just like one, two,
[2468.26s -> 2489.43s]  three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and get to the top by breaking the glass. I can do that in
[2489.43s -> 2522.76s]  this room. I can do that in here. What? Why can't I break that? Oops. Back it up. I can't even. I
[2522.76s -> 2553.06s]  can't touch it. Whatever. Break the barrels. Turn it around like this. There we go. Try breaking
[2553.06s -> 2592.18s]  the planks. Oh, it's fun. I don't want to do puzzles. Oh, TV. What's on the TV? Let's find out.
[2592.18s -> 2645.11s]  Wait, is this cheating? What am I? What do I have to do? Do it right? Look at me. Look at me.
[2645.27s -> 2674.02s]  Okay. Now get me over here. Why can't I get up here? Okay. What? What? What's wrong with me?
[2674.74s -> 2688.62s]  Why did I do that? Why did I get sucked backwards? Somebody just grabbed me by the back of the head
[2688.62s -> 2724.26s]  and just pulled me up here. Get. Go. What's wrong? You're five foot three. What? Where'd I go?
[2725.72s -> 2737.46s]  Okay. Hold on. Trouble jumping? No, I'm not having trouble jumping. I'm fine. What happened?
[2737.46s -> 2745.24s]  Emergency elevator lock. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2745.24s -> 2770.30s]  Wait, don't go without me. Oh, what's wrong with me? Emergency elevator override. You failed the
[2770.30s -> 2780.89s]  tutorial. Did you say I need to pull this out? You know what? I could do without like the fucking
[2780.97s -> 2801.26s]  porn music in my ears. Can I just skip this shit? Okay. So I have to go. I, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's
[2801.26s -> 2824.68s]  go. There we go. All right. Move. All right. What's wrong with this shit? Why is it so difficult for
[2824.68s -> 2848.50s]  me to do this part? I'm not supposed to be doing it like this. I'm doing this part wrong. What?
[2848.50s -> 2878.39s]  What is this for? Okay. All right. Let's not fuck this part up now. Let's go. Now that's going to
[2878.39s -> 2901.48s]  stay, right? Get off it. What's the point of this? Emergency elevator override. Puzzle master. Go
[2901.48s -> 2910.86s]  back up. This is a puzzle game. Please don't tell me this is a puzzle game. How do I go back up?
[2912.58s -> 2929.06s]  I can't. It is. There are a lot of, not this way. Get the fuck off me. Can I delete the soundtrack?
[2929.06s -> 2945.67s]  Like how do I just remove the soundtrack from the game? Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[2946.47s -> 2966.73s]  I gotta go back up there and then jump over that shit. I don't know. Shut off the TV. Okay.
[2968.87s -> 2981.35s]  Whoa. All right. Get me the fuck out of here. What's this portal bullshit? Welcome to floor two.
[2985.19s -> 3000.12s]  I keep thinking that's me. Hold on. We're good. All right. Let's see. That makes me dizzy though.
[3000.12s -> 3017.48s]  I gotta be careful. All right. Where's the fucking Macy's? Here. Skechers is here. You may find these
[3017.48s -> 3022.12s]  exhibits more complex and somewhat challenging. Please take all the time you need in order to
[3022.12s -> 3026.28s]  fully grasp these mechanics. We recommend taking a short break then return to these concepts.
[3027.74s -> 3065.70s]  Oh god. Is this gonna fling me? Oh. Can I weigh this down? Drinking of water. Where is it? And I
[3065.70s -> 3082.78s]  will have some coffee too. Let me get some coffee. Okay. All right. We're good. Out of breath?
[3083.74s -> 3096.66s]  I'm not having... All right. This music though has gotta go. Menu operation. Pressing menu
[3096.66s -> 3107.48s]  button again. Hold the menu button and point cursor. All right. What's the... Okay. References.
[3112.18s -> 3125.53s]  References. What the fuck? I'm not listening to that for like another few hours. I'm just not
[3125.53s -> 3138.28s]  going to. Does that change? Like I could tolerate it like here. The music changes. All right. Well,
[3138.28s -> 3155.51s]  how about like a six? What's this? Okay. That's a menu. Got it. Let's go. Body slots?
[3161.43s -> 3166.23s]  Large items can be stored in the back. You just grab it, let go.
[3166.95s -> 3175.35s]  So you can reach back and pick them up. They were very concerned that you weren't going to
[3175.35s -> 3181.08s]  know how to like jump and hold items in this game. It seems in the beginning here. Gun mags have a
[3181.08s -> 3191.61s]  pouch on your hip. Yeah. That's this thing here. Okay. Well, give it to me. Okay. Because you don't.
[3192.25s -> 3215.67s]  Oh yeah. I know how to do this. All right. How do I let the clip go? Not like that. Is it storing
[3215.67s -> 3229.37s]  it? All right. That's storing that. That's not how you do it. How do I do it? There we go. Okay.
[3229.37s -> 3239.06s]  Cool. I can sit with the gun. I have an inventory. Yep. I go like this. Inventory. And then I can
[3239.06s -> 3256.17s]  grab shit. Manage slots. I want this on this side here. What's the... What? Figure discipline.
[3256.81s -> 3291.35s]  How did I drop the... How am I dropping this? Lower? I have to go this way. All right. I'm ready.
[3291.35s -> 3323.58s]  I'm ready for bone works. Fuck. What the fuck, man? Okay. What's this? Throw these objects
[3324.22s -> 3338.90s]  into reclamation bins to unlock them in sandbox scenes. Oh, cool. What's this? I already have
[3338.90s -> 3358.47s]  one of these. Search these bone boxes. They contain reclaimables and throw the reclaimables
[3358.47s -> 3371.51s]  in the reclaim station. Oh, come on. Purchasing items? Exchange bullet tokens to purchase items.
[3372.15s -> 3389.26s]  Those ammo? What? Okay. Preserve acquired items for later use using a reclaim bin. All right. So
[3389.26s -> 3408.66s]  what do I want? Okay. So let's go here. Inventory. Where am I? Where was my bin? Okay. Give me that.
[3409.14s -> 3423.75s]  They're all the same thing, right? Cool. All right. Give me a refund. Cool. All right. Oh,
[3423.75s -> 3445.61s]  shit. I already have one of those though, don't I? Did I just waste money? Okay. Did I waste money?
[3454.26s -> 3476.31s]  Stop. Just get it in. Okay. Okay. Can I... Let's go. Are we ready? Items cannot travel between
[3476.31s -> 3493.98s]  instances but projectile math can. What? Projectile math? Keep weapon pointed in a safe direction.
[3493.98s -> 3497.02s]  Keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot. Keep weapon unloaded in an
[3497.02s -> 3539.19s]  equip slot until you're ready to use it. Okay. Are these made out of cement? That's like a 98%
[3539.19s -> 3561.80s]  accuracy. Oh, that would have been sick. What's this one? Why am I crouching? Stop crouching.
[3561.80s -> 3578.12s]  Get up. Fun. All right. What else is there? Oh, wow. What is this one? Where does it go?
[3578.84s -> 3594.23s]  Where does it go? Okay. What? Is it ready? Hey, how do I turn it on?
[3594.87s -> 3639.02s]  There we go. Cool. What is it doing? It's hard. The index controllers are like really hard to get
[3639.02s -> 3649.48s]  used to. That thing was automatically firing because I have to physically actually hold this
[3650.84s -> 3676.38s]  with like all my hands. All right. Inventory slots. Cool. What's this one? Let's see what I'm
[3676.38s -> 3694.81s]  talking about. Uh-huh. Fire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's because I'm gripping like...
[3694.81s -> 3701.05s]  Where are you? Because I'm gripping like this, right? You're supposed to do this when you hold
[3701.05s -> 3743.88s]  a gun because this... Yeah. It's tricky. Don't turn around. Cool. You can't gun. Be careful.
[3743.88s -> 3751.08s]  You're wasting ammo. This is just like a how to shoot the gun tutorial. Impact physics. Oh, yes.
[3751.08s -> 3794.14s]  Okay. I've been waiting for this all fucking day. Damn it. Fuck. Oh, this is knives?
[3795.46s -> 3802.79s]  Holy shit. Come on. I got to do it like in the movies. No. Who's that guy? The League of Legends
[3802.79s -> 3855.96s]  character? A twist of fate, right? The guy that throws whatever he is. Oh, yeah. I'm ready. I
[3855.96s -> 3881.74s]  literally made a fucking mess. Let's go. Hold on. Wait. Break the... I got to break the barrels?
[3892.31s -> 3928.17s]  Oh, shit. Cool. How do I do this? I see. Okay. It's got to go in that one spot.
[3931.78s -> 3956.42s]  Should I take a gun? All right. Let's go. I took more than one gun.
[3957.06s -> 3968.39s]  Where the... Oh, I threw the handguns. Fuck. I don't even know where this come from.
[3969.21s -> 3989.94s]  I don't fucking even need it. Let's go. All right. This is not the place to be on the shooting range.
[3992.78s -> 4000.25s]  Hold on. It's like... Okay. You ever go to the driving range? Like the driving range, right?
[4000.25s -> 4006.41s]  With the club. You're hitting golf balls. And like you hit like a little dribbler and it goes
[4007.85s -> 4014.41s]  10 feet in front of you. Don't go get that ball. Do not go get that ball. Don't do it. You see
[4014.41s -> 4020.42s]  people do that shit. They're like, oh, whoops. And they walk out there like five feet. You're
[4020.42s -> 4025.78s]  going to get a ball sliced into your head. Just don't fucking do that. Handsless psycho. What?
[4026.50s -> 4058.52s]  Three handguns. What the fuck? Dude, this is kind of hard to do. Am I doing this like wrong?
[4062.26s -> 4073.02s]  It's like I can't reach that far into my body. It's because you're crouched?
[4077.78s -> 4092.84s]  Even still, this feels weird to do. Like you need pants. You are crouched. I'm not crouched.
[4093.56s -> 4116.06s]  Like you have... Look at how like weirdly I have to look down at that. I don't... I don't need 500
[4116.06s -> 4139.21s]  bullets I'm leaving. Like this is... Okay. Let's go. I don't care. You don't need to put... Oh,
[4139.21s -> 4159.00s]  wait. What did that person say? No, we're good. You don't need to put the bullets in your pouch?
[4159.96s -> 4177.37s]  Attention. The exhibits in the following chamber represent complex concepts.
[4177.37s -> 4187.51s]  You may exit through the gift shop if you desire to bypass these advanced chambers.
[4187.51s -> 4212.68s]  I'll be using that. I got the key. Where is the gift shop over there? I'm going out through the
[4212.68s -> 4216.68s]  gift shop if this is too hard. I don't even care if everyone... I don't care how embarrassing that is.
[4216.68s -> 4266.54s]  Time control? Whoa. Hey, what the hell? Where do I go? Trash handlers. Oh, I can move around
[4266.54s -> 4304.52s]  with this. This is so hard. Hold on. I need to... Am I going to knock that down? I'm going to knock
[4304.52s -> 4337.86s]  this down. Am I holding this backwards? What the fuck? What the box? Do I have to like get
[4337.86s -> 4344.02s]  them to come over here for something, right? Did it... Oh, the box and the... Wait, I did it?
[4347.64s -> 4366.63s]  Oh, I did it. How do I put this away? How do I put this away? Get rid of one of the pistols.
[4367.27s -> 4387.03s]  All right. I got it. Nice. That was fucking easy. I'm like a rat in a maze. It's a collectible. All
[4387.03s -> 4397.22s]  right. Gravity room. Negative gravity fields provide temporary inverse mass calculation for
[4397.22s -> 4403.16s]  improbable... I know what this music reminds me of. Okay. If you were to right now go to the
[4403.16s -> 4409.48s]  app store, the Apple app store, and you were to type in like marble adventure game. This is
[4409.48s -> 4416.44s]  every song that plays on like a marble get through the obstacle course iPad iPhone game.
[4417.56s -> 4429.74s]  That's what it is. Mass... Okay. Gravity. Anti-gravity. Anti-mass physics are extremely
[4429.74s -> 4438.04s]  experimental. Please enjoy this exhibit at your own risk. I got my gravity gun. So now what?
[4438.04s -> 4452.36s]  Balloons deliver capable upward force. What? Oh, I'm making balloons. Do I have to like...
[4453.00s -> 4469.06s]  What just happened? What happened to my... Hold on. What just happened? Oh my god. I'm so sweaty.
[4471.48s -> 4486.39s]  You farted? No, no, no. Hold on. Did you hear that? Give me one second. It sounded like my VR thing
[4486.39s -> 4502.02s]  fucked up. Let me see. You guys can still see, right? Okay. That was weird. Let me just drink
[4502.02s -> 4508.60s]  some water and coffee. I'm... Okay. I'm forever in balance. I'm drinking a shitload of coffee
[4508.60s -> 4514.28s]  and a shitload of water. So like the diuretic that the coffee is, is being outweighed by the water.
[4515.16s -> 4529.66s]  All right. I'm going back in. Can you guys even hear what I'm saying? Probably not.
[4530.30s -> 4543.69s]  Where are your eyebrows? They're being squished. Where are your eyebrows? Oh, my hair.
[4547.38s -> 4568.73s]  Back in the bone work. Oh my god. This is probably so loud. I'm sorry. I just lost audio in my left
[4568.73s -> 4580.50s]  ear. That was weird. What's going on there? Okay. Audio is like leaving my left side of my head.
[4581.30s -> 4599.14s]  Spin. All right. So I have a balloon gun. Where is it? Right here. Did I just do it to myself?
[4599.14s -> 4652.66s]  Dude, is it going to work? Come on. Why is this not working? Come on. It's in every cartoon. Yeah.
[4652.66s -> 4665.21s]  My headset's fucked up. Oh shit. This is like actually like broken. My... This cord is...
[4666.17s -> 4676.14s]  Where does this go? Because my... I keep losing audio in my left ear when this cord is like
[4676.14s -> 4712.98s]  moved at all. What? Cord loose? That's what I was hearing. Oh, it's fucked up. Yeah. I'm losing
[4712.98s -> 4737.88s]  audio in my left ear. Whatever. It doesn't happen all the time. It sucks though. Index.
[4739.93s -> 4758.97s]  Broken out of the box. I think that's better. Okay. Sounds like it's a... No. It's still happening.
[4760.58s -> 4765.86s]  Fuck. I don't have audio in my left ear. Because when I tighten this is when it goes away.
[4766.50s -> 4779.90s]  Oh, that's monumentally fucking disappointing. That's really disappointing. Oh well. All right.
[4779.90s -> 4803.59s]  Let's go. Check the connections at the tower. No. This is all plugged in good. Yeah. This is all
[4803.59s -> 4815.18s]  good to go. Because when I... If I put pressure on the cord up on my head, it cuts out in and out.
[4818.52s -> 4830.12s]  Went to... What are you saying? Hold on. Went to SteamVR beta instead. Updated to beta headset
[4830.12s -> 4847.74s]  firmware. Verify integrity. File of left speaker now works. Oh shit. Really? Huh. That's a lot of
[4847.74s -> 4854.10s]  messages. All right. Whatever. It doesn't happen that often. It's not a software fix if I can wiggle
[4854.10s -> 4862.52s]  the cord. That's really fucking annoying. This shit's like a thousand bucks. Like, come on.
[4864.84s -> 4871.45s]  I mean, I did like punch it a little. I like hit my face a little bit. Did I break it by like
[4871.45s -> 4878.79s]  hitting my head? Like kind of a little bit? That's disappointing. But whatever. It's playable.
[4879.27s -> 4894.68s]  Just disappointing. Sorry about that. All right. Let's go. It's playable. It's just annoying.
[4895.32s -> 4909.43s]  All right. So this is... Let me go like this. Oh, I gotta pull my pants up. No gravity. Do I have to
[4909.43s -> 4926.68s]  make this thing move? How do I get these off my body? Can I get these off my arm? How do I get
[4926.68s -> 4949.78s]  these off? Cut them off? Shoot them? I have to shoot them? Where's my stuff? Shoot more balloons
[4949.78s -> 4976.46s]  and they'll go away. Oh, pretty sick. Oh shit. Gotta go. No, but I don't want these on my arm.
[4980.94s -> 4987.42s]  God damn it. How do I get rid of these? All right. I got a plan. Wait. No, I don't. Fuck it. Let's
[4987.42s -> 5024.39s]  go. Oh shit. I'm fucking... Are the balloons keeping me up? Go die. Give me a... God damn it.
[5024.39s -> 5035.56s]  What do I do? I can't... They're attached. How do I get out of here?
[5038.62s -> 5076.58s]  Why is this happening? Let me go. Softlock. Did I softlock the game? No. All right. How do I reset?
[5076.58s -> 5101.00s]  How do I reset it? Burp Charlie. Eject? Punch them? Shoot them? I don't have a gun. Get off of me.
[5106.34s -> 5120.18s]  Put more balloons? I can't. The gun's down there. Throw ammo at them. No, come back here.
[5121.06s -> 5163.69s]  Oh, it works. It works. It works. That person's a genius. Okay. Get me up here. Go. Come here.
[5169.51s -> 5185.59s]  Break it. What's this one fucking made out of? Come here. Wait. Wait. This is less. Go, go, go,
[5185.59s -> 5204.57s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Why do I... Okay. I'm good. Why are the balloons still there?
[5204.57s -> 5221.66s]  Shouldn't they be deleted? All right. Here's the gift shop. That's creepy. What does this one do?
[5222.30s -> 5259.75s]  I don't like that. Get it off. Crystals? Can I steal this stuff? I'm just going to walk out with
[5259.75s -> 5292.73s]  it. What are they going to do? Wait. I want to drink. Never mind. Never mind. Pick up that can.
[5292.73s -> 5317.03s]  I don't want this. Never mind. Recycle. Garbage and recycling chamber. This is fun.
[5331.19s -> 5387.66s]  I'm done. Were I supposed to do that? Tutorial complete. Okay. I'm in the trash.
[5394.04s -> 5402.66s]  Better. All right. Let me get this situated. Better. Can't grab anything.
[5402.66s -> 5463.16s]  Feels like a person. Come here. Big city. Did I go that way? Okay. It was an audio again.
[5468.49s -> 5475.98s]  You know what I think it is? I think it's like the top of the cord is like something happened to it.
[5475.98s -> 5499.74s]  Like in here. Like wherever the cord sits. Oh my God. Oops. Sorry. Are you guys here in the
[5499.74s -> 5522.57s]  audio cutout or is it just me that hears it? Oh box. Okay. Wait. I break with this. There's
[5522.57s -> 5557.34s]  nothing in here. Tether ball. Cool. Now what? Tether balls are the best. Yeah. I remember just
[5557.34s -> 5563.61s]  sitting next to the tether ball. Everybody did this shit. You would go be going around slowly
[5563.61s -> 5568.49s]  and you would just be like queuing up a fucking haymaker and you were just going to like crowhop
[5568.49s -> 5574.89s]  like three times and punch it as hard as you could. You know those things need to come back.
[5574.89s -> 5586.34s]  They were fun. Jerma seems not very enthralled by this game. Not really. I think it has to do
[5586.34s -> 5602.73s]  too with the fact that I sometimes don't hear out of my left ear. Keep out. Oh, a brick. Two bricks.
[5602.73s -> 5639.02s]  Get it off. I can't pull this off. Why not? I can't get it off. Why is the guy alive?
[5641.22s -> 5679.38s]  Come on. Let me skyrim this guy. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Die. All right. Well, he's dead.
[5688.55s -> 5719.13s]  Ball. Give me this. Can I? Wait. Hold the other way. Get off there. This way. Can I go that way?
[5727.19s -> 5747.72s]  All right. We got it. That guy attacked us. District six. I can't break that with a hammer.
[5747.72s -> 5760.87s]  I have to put a brick. Now, of course, I've got to shoot the basketball. Not even close.
[5762.31s -> 5786.41s]  Oh, free stuff. All right. Where are we now? Broadwatchers skip. Um, you get VR streamers
[5786.41s -> 5804.46s]  skip might be actually what we do here. We've got 35 games. Skip it. I'm going to give it a little
[5804.46s -> 5811.86s]  bit more time. I feel like we just kind of got into it. I'm not into it though. It's not doing
[5811.86s -> 5830.46s]  it for me. It just isn't. All right. So they okay. Let me start attacking them. Let me try to like
[5830.46s -> 5862.71s]  just actually fight them. Never punched before. I don't I think I just have to keep going and jump
[5862.71s -> 5879.77s]  over this. Get the hammer. I thought that was a gun. What is this for? Why can I pick up this
[5879.77s -> 5894.04s]  fucking satellite? Okay. Who is howling? Smash him with the satellite. All right. Let me see if I
[5894.04s -> 5902.14s]  can hit him in the head with the satellite. All right. Come over here. Come here. Come here. Come
[5902.14s -> 5927.90s]  here. You come here. Can you not jump over here? Get the fuck. Why is this slow? Wait, what? Did I
[5927.90s -> 5952.46s]  die? I'm just going to keep going. All right. I need, I need a general consensus from the people
[5952.46s -> 5960.01s]  that are in chat right now. Should I continue to play Boneworks? Like am I like, should I just keep
[5960.01s -> 5989.02s]  going or what do you think? Hey, this is a four hour game. I feel like it's longer than that.
[5989.02s -> 6015.53s]  I knocked him over. We're good. That's not going to shoot me, right? I don't have an inventory full
[6015.53s -> 6027.37s]  of stuff. Uh, yeah. I took a bunch of guns. Oh, come on. What employee promotion raffle? Um,
[6027.37s -> 6038.49s]  it's like 10 hours. It's cool, but I kind of feel like I'm just moving from like portal room to
[6038.49s -> 6044.12s]  portal room. It's like, I didn't, I didn't think this was going to be like a puzzle game. This is
[6044.12s -> 6057.91s]  not what I thought it was going to be. The shooter part starts like now. That's what I kind of, I
[6057.91s -> 6065.66s]  want, I don't want to just leave immediately. I want to kind of see. Can I go in that door?
[6065.66s -> 6075.75s]  Oh, it's a fake door. All right. So I got to find the key, obviously. And the key's probably like
[6075.75s -> 6096.04s]  over here. What the? I thought I knocked it over. Guns in this game are fun. Yeah. Um, I'm moving on.
[6096.04s -> 6117.43s]  That was Boneworks. There's a button on the back of the gun. Yeah, we're gonna, I'm moving on.
[6117.43s -> 6123.46s]  It's, this, this game's like 10 hours and I, I kind of wish I didn't do the whole tutorial then.
[6123.46s -> 6135.14s]  I feel like I'm invested at this point, which is unfortunate. Um, you literally stopped before
[6135.14s -> 6157.21s]  it got interesting. I know, right? And that's like, I pressed this. What is he doing? Can I
[6157.21s -> 6172.49s]  press the button? Please get the fuck out of here. I learned this from wrestling empire,
[6172.49s -> 6190.42s]  motherfucker. Come back to it another time. All right. Yeah. We're moving on. It's like four
[6190.42s -> 6210.39s]  different games tied to the tutorial. All right. Boneworks. That was Boneworks. We're going to move
[6210.39s -> 6218.92s]  on to one. I think I'm going to have a lot of fun. That was a journalist. I, I was kind of boring.
[6218.92s -> 6226.18s]  I have to be completely honest with you. I think I thought, I thought it was kind of boring.
[6226.18s -> 6243.35s]  Tape the cable. It's better later on. Yeah. It's like two, it's a tutorial physics showcase. And
[6243.35s -> 6247.82s]  then the game, there's a lot of people don't get into Boneworks and a lot of people get very
[6247.82s -> 6253.75s]  mad when people don't get into Boneworks. I mean, I, have you bet? I mean, it's look with
[6253.75s -> 6257.43s]  the knuckle controllers, that was fucking cool. I had a lot of fun and like to just jump around
[6257.43s -> 6265.30s]  and throw things and shoot stuff. It was, I mean, look, if it's a 10 hour game, I only stream for
[6265.30s -> 6272.33s]  like five to six hours. I'm probably not going to do the whole thing. I hated this game at the start,
[6272.33s -> 6276.09s]  but pushing through it ended up being kind of worth it. It does suck at the start, but that can't
[6276.09s -> 6284.89s]  be, oh, oh, well that's all right. Maybe we'll come back to it. It was fun. I just, it was,
[6284.89s -> 6288.79s]  I guess I was expecting something else somehow. I don't know why I went in. I don't know why I
[6288.79s -> 6296.63s]  went in with an expectation. That was, all right, we're going to move on. I turned the gun on.
[6297.67s -> 6327.90s]  All right, we're going to move on to, uh, I want to play the baseball game. All right. Let's,
[6327.90s -> 6335.16s]  let's, let's put, let's get the energy up. Are you guys ready? Are you ready for more high energy?
[6335.16s -> 6352.78s]  Weekly meltdown? What? I do have to change this, but that's not what we're playing. Does this even
[6352.86s -> 6369.00s]  have a, I don't even, I'm not even sure this is on steam or on Twitch. Oh yeah, it is. All right.
[6369.64s -> 6382.66s]  Well, it's ready. Hey there, all you bat swingers out there in VR land. DJ Debbie here to keep
[6382.66s -> 6387.78s]  things cooking with some of your fave hits from around the globe. Relax and sit back. All right,
[6387.78s -> 6394.18s]  time for high energy. I don't know. You know what it was? I think that game just made me like low
[6394.18s -> 6401.48s]  energy. I don't know what it did. I don't know why it was just like, I got, I started to be,
[6401.48s -> 6419.56s]  I was like, let's go. This chord is really tangled though. I blame the music. No,
[6420.76s -> 6427.85s]  are we going to do some untangling? I just spit that all over myself.
[6428.49s -> 6432.58s]  All right, which way do I got to turn this way? Find out.
[6437.86s -> 6446.41s]  I can't wait for this. This is going to be awesome. All right. I really got to be careful. I
[6446.41s -> 6449.45s]  don't actually hurt myself here because I'm going to be super into this.
[6454.07s -> 6479.22s]  You ready? All right. Character. Whoa. Okay. Head. I like that one. I don't think it really matters
[6479.86s -> 6507.27s]  over that one. Face. All right. That one. Body. That one's fine. This one's fine. What about,
[6507.27s -> 6527.78s]  can I make it brown? Facial hair? No, none. No, I'm not doing that. All right. Confirm. All right. I
[6527.78s -> 6537.86s]  get it. I'm so excited. Here we go. Always hold both controllers when playing this game. Okay.
[6539.06s -> 6546.42s]  Are you, I'm right-handed. Choose your locomotion. Running. To move, hold down the buttons.
[6547.06s -> 6550.02s]  I freaked out. I thought this was like a local Vegas radio station.
[6551.30s -> 6560.62s]  Hold down the buttons lighting up on your controller and swing your, whoa. Okay.
[6561.58s -> 6575.54s]  I don't know if I really like that. That's too much. Walk by holding down the trackpad thumbsticks.
[6575.54s -> 6582.55s]  Okay. Yeah. That's hold down bolt. Yeah. Okay. That's much better. Some players have issues
[6582.55s -> 6585.91s]  with locomotion. So we've given you an option to create a projection of your character when
[6585.91s -> 6590.70s]  doing movement inputs to allow you to see your destination before teleporting there.
[6593.13s -> 6601.43s]  Let's just go. All right. Announcer. Practice. Pitching practice. I'm ready.
[6605.74s -> 6621.50s]  Oh, here we go. Oh, this is, all right. This is going to be sick. You got a Mega Man hand
[6624.28s -> 6642.36s]  ball. Do I, I don't have to actually throw it. Right. You actually have to catch the ball too.
[6642.36s -> 6651.34s]  All right. This is cool. Hey, do I have to actually catch the balls? Oh, wait a minute. Quick menu.
[6651.34s -> 6681.00s]  Cannon. What? Oh no. Wait. Left. I can't give it to me. Fuck. This is so hard. And you actually,
[6681.00s -> 6690.47s]  you actually have to grab too. I'm going to, maybe I shouldn't do manual. Maybe it's going to be too
[6690.47s -> 6714.97s]  hard. There we go. All right. Just takes a little bit of getting used to. I'm going to do that so
[6714.97s -> 6725.30s]  often. All right. I get it. I get it. I like it. Let's go. Okay. Now I want to do hitting. I want
[6725.30s -> 6736.10s]  to do hitting tutorial, batting practice. Dude, if this is okay, if this is as fun as I think it's
[6736.10s -> 6748.01s]  going to be no fucking way. Are you kidding me? This is like, we, this is everything I wanted from
[6748.81s -> 6774.31s]  Oh my God. It's like exact one to one. Shit. Where'd the bat go? Damn it. Okay. I'm swinging late.
[6774.31s -> 6796.87s]  Swing early. There we go. All right. I'm hitting the top of the ball. Stand back. Am I too close?
[6796.87s -> 6811.48s]  Keep dropping the bat. Baseball is back. You keep bunting. I'm trying not to bunt. It's,
[6811.48s -> 6822.98s]  you got to slow down. All right. All right. Yeah. I, I, I, I got to back it up like here.
[6822.98s -> 6835.69s]  What is it? What is it doing? Get off. Fucking index. What are you doing? All right. One more.
[6835.69s -> 6846.94s]  I got to get under the ball more. I'm too far over it. Kill the batter. I mean,
[6850.50s -> 6870.73s]  I have to get the ball in the air. This is such a good weakling. All right. Why does every VR game
[6870.73s -> 6887.02s]  have the same song that's looped on five seconds? I don't know. Cannon. All right. I got the hang of
[6887.02s -> 6906.49s]  it. I'm ready. Okay. Let's do it. Play ball. Easy against the sloths. I can't do anything else.
[6906.49s -> 6918.06s]  How many innings? We'll start with three. I don't want to do nine innings. Wait, why am I the
[6918.06s -> 6948.07s]  announcer? Why am I announcing the game? Oh shit. All right. I'm ready. Oh my God.
[6958.66s -> 6977.19s]  Yeah, whatever. I just, I'm warming up. Okay. I'm fine. Wait, can he run? Wait, he can run. Hey,
[6977.19s -> 7002.71s]  don't let him run yet. Oh my God. This is crazy. Come on. I got to release like earlier. Oh my God.
[7002.71s -> 7024.41s]  I can't. What happened? You actually field the balls. Can you hit the batter? Stop, turn off,
[7024.41s -> 7046.33s]  throwing assist. Is that going to help me? What the fuck? Why? I'm not. Turn it on. Oh, I thought
[7046.33s -> 7069.24s]  you said turn it off. Do I have to actually run as the runner? My back went fast. Fuck. Come on,
[7069.24s -> 7091.53s]  dude. God, I can't. That's a strike. That's a fucking strike. Good thing out of here. Wait,
[7091.53s -> 7118.84s]  who's? What? I'm so confused. I threw it that far. This guy is a psycho. There it is. All right. I
[7118.84s -> 7146.84s]  think I got it. All right. Up. Get it. I think I have to stand back a little more. Oh my God.
[7147.48s -> 7212.09s]  I'm just going to use the cannon. Fuck it. God damn it. Strike. Give me the fucking cannon.
[7212.09s -> 7231.83s]  Give me the cannon. I don't care. Give me the fucking cannon. I can't hurt them. Wow. That was
[7231.83s -> 7261.53s]  bad. Give me it. What? Get it. Get it. Get that ball and throw it over there. Oh, I wonder if
[7261.53s -> 7302.73s]  it's going to be a ball. Wait, can I, can he, can he hit it from here? Oh, damn it. What are you
[7302.73s -> 7332.65s]  doing? Boneworks lost to this. Yeah. I'm actually like, I'm like enjoying myself. Fuck. All right.
[7332.65s -> 7348.62s]  Time for my turn. Low blood sugar. Andy, what are you talking about? Low. Whoa. Okay.
[7355.82s -> 7380.42s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What? Why am I still at the plate? That's way, way outside.
[7380.42s -> 7414.68s]  Way outside. Go, go, go, go, go. Why am I so slow? I got to get like in there. Like in there. Safe.
[7414.68s -> 7441.43s]  That's a hit. Oh. Somebody just called me a fuck boy. Why?
[7454.18s -> 7463.61s]  I got it. All right. This is actually really fun. Can you imagine playing this at two player
[7463.61s -> 7470.70s]  with multiplayer? This would be so good. All right. Down and in.
[7472.92s -> 7486.50s]  There it is. Out. He's gone. He's having fun. I am having fun.
[7487.46s -> 7517.45s]  Hold on. Hey, Sally. Good to see you. I want to get a strike so bad. I'm just ruining the
[7517.45s -> 7539.16s]  game for everybody. Oh, come on. Turn off the movement vignette. Can I? See if I can turn it
[7539.16s -> 7549.90s]  off. I don't think I can turn off the movement vignette. Don't break you back. I'm good.
[7551.88s -> 7559.99s]  Well prepared. Don't ever look when you're running to first base. It's a huge mistake.
[7569.58s -> 7600.12s]  Oh my God. Go. He sucks so much. It's difficult. All right. Come on. Strike.
[7600.12s -> 7615.77s]  Wasn't even in the batter's box. I got it. I don't know how I got it, but I did.
[7618.62s -> 7657.16s]  That's so cool. Got it. That ugly ass vignette. Yeah. I don't know. It is weird. That's not a home
[7657.16s -> 7684.92s]  run, right? Okay. I don't even. Where's that player? Oh, you're you. What the fuck? I have
[7684.92s -> 7702.54s]  to catch it too? What kind of Bugs Bunny shit is that? I have to throw the ball and then catch
[7702.54s -> 7734.15s]  the ball that I throw. Oh, fuck. I should have laid out for it. Get out of the way. Oh my God.
[7734.15s -> 7765.51s]  All right. This is my last chance. Fucking run. I did. Okay. I got it. All right. I'm good.
[7765.51s -> 7786.94s]  That's a ball. Go. One handed baseball. I mean, it's hard to do it. I'm doing better than it was
[7786.94s -> 7817.99s]  last time. Damn it. No, that's I'm good. Man on first and second. You're not going to catch it.
[7817.99s -> 7832.78s]  I know I'm good. I got it. I got it. I got one more. One more. One more. One more. All right.
[7832.78s -> 7845.43s]  We're good. All right. All right. All right. Right. I'm I got it this time. It's loss of
[7845.43s -> 7866.98s]  fucked. Let's go. Just back off the plate. No more vignette either. We're good. Oh, thank God.
[7866.98s -> 7880.65s]  Resident sleeper. Let me enjoy my baseball game. Don't worry. Do I have it? Who has it?
[7880.65s -> 7907.94s]  Where's the ball? What? What happened? I don't understand what happened. Double play. Let's go.
[7907.94s -> 7934.04s]  He's coming back. Give me the ball. You have to catch it on your own. There we go. All right.
[7934.04s -> 7945.85s]  I'm backing way off the plate. I wasn't even ready. That's bullshit. Oh my God. Just throw
[7945.85s -> 7971.00s]  me out. I don't care. Dead there. Oh, come on. Throw it. You want to go pickle. You want to do a
[7971.00s -> 8016.39s]  pickle. This is the technique. I got it. Ball. This is so stupid. Run back. Why are you running
[8016.39s -> 8037.59s]  that far? What the fuck are you doing? Why would you do that? I have to like move with it. The
[8037.59s -> 8063.91s]  fair ball. That's not a fair ball. Wait, what just happened? Are you fucking kidding me? Oh,
[8063.91s -> 8081.99s]  always run it out. Always run out the first base. You all, you know that. Oh my God. Why did you
[8081.99s -> 8099.37s]  stop? Cause I just thought I was gone. I can't do it. It's so fucking awkward. I know the arrow is
[8099.37s -> 8106.71s]  there, but it's like weird. I'm like facing a completely different direction. You high.
[8107.27s -> 8117.22s]  You think I would play VR high? Are you out of your mind? You were in the batter's box.
[8117.22s -> 8138.34s]  Give me a break. I've done VR high. No, I've drank and played VR and that was fucking hell,
[8138.34s -> 8157.69s]  but it was fun. There we go. All right. Come on. Safe. Nice. Do I keep going? What's the score?
[8157.69s -> 8209.91s]  Zero zero. Mike muted. What do you mean? Nice cam. Sorry. All right. I got men on first and second.
[8209.91s -> 8213.43s]  Base is loaded. All right. Let me give me a home run right now. Come on. I got to impress
[8213.43s -> 8229.72s]  everybody in chat. Finally see his balls. That's it. There we go. Finally my first run ever.
[8229.72s -> 8265.40s]  Okay. This is pog. Yeah. Fuck. Whatever. Run. It's all right. It's all right. What the hell
[8265.40s -> 8296.20s]  just happened? Attacking me. Stop facing the guy. Why are you swinging downwards? Cause every time
[8296.20s -> 8315.16s]  I try to swing upwards, I never get the ball in the air. How come computer hit far, but you know,
[8319.80s -> 8357.21s]  Oh shit. I won. All right. That was fun. Now what? Where are we going now? Let's see. Where are we
[8357.21s -> 8379.29s]  going? I got a lot of shit here. How about time hacker? Pull up your pants. I, I, oh boy. It's
[8379.29s -> 8399.30s]  time for time hacker settings. Ambient. 100%. How do I change that? Oh, voice. There's a voices
[8399.30s -> 8407.78s]  timer on hand. Right height autos. Fine. Reset progress. Okay. Take control, teleport and
[8407.78s -> 8425.91s]  rotation. Can we continuous motion dash grab? Shoot. I'll figure it out. Let's go. Hello time
[8425.91s -> 8432.55s]  hacker. Welcome to AI development. Now I will take you on a tour and you will show what you are
[8432.55s -> 8441.61s]  capable of as you increase the size of the sphere. Time slows down when you make the time
[8441.61s -> 8449.22s]  completely expand the sphere until it breaks. What the hell move to an indicated place using
[8449.22s -> 8459.86s]  continuous move. Try to move by dashing. Open the door. All right. Wait, that's me. I'm moving so
[8459.86s -> 8477.30s]  fast. Open the door. How do I do that? Okay. Try to turn using the controller. This person is very,
[8477.30s -> 8481.99s]  this is like a very close to their mic with a high compressor. I love it. Right. Do what with
[8481.99s -> 8492.71s]  the controller? All right. It's like snap movements, fucking fluid. I like it. Movement is very fluid.
[8492.71s -> 8511.19s]  It's very good. Teleport to the indicated place. Teleport. Oh, all right. Pretty fluid.
[8517.62s -> 8522.38s]  Uh, can one of the, if one of the mods is here, can they make, um, can they make a,
[8522.38s -> 8533.45s]  can they change the game name to a time, uh, classic, whatever it's called? Oh shit. That's
[8533.45s -> 8545.21s]  me. Time hacker. I will destroy everyone and you can't stop me. Notify something, say about
[8545.21s -> 8555.62s]  first. Activate the virus. Do I have to slow down time? This guy's moving like he's in VR.
[8563.30s -> 8576.62s]  Now kill him. Kill me. Time to die. Oh shit. This is 2501. Our first AI development that failed.
[8576.62s -> 8582.78s]  He managed to get our robots out of the control. Only you can control them and stop him.
[8583.42s -> 8590.46s]  Show what you can do. Expand the sphere until it breaks. Point your hand at, hold the button.
[8590.46s -> 8596.94s]  Point your hand at the enemy. Hold the button and pull towards you to leave the body. What?
[8596.94s -> 8603.24s]  It's the same button. Look at this guy. I just realized that I'm like a super jacked
[8603.80s -> 8613.70s]  Batman guy. Try to get back into the character. Excellent. Now you're ready for real resistance.
[8613.70s -> 8622.55s]  Really? Okay. Until the enemies spot us, make them destroy each other. What to stop time completely
[8622.55s -> 8630.71s]  expand, take control of the first enemy. Point the gun at the second enemy and shoot. Check out
[8630.71s -> 8638.63s]  the enemy. Quickly take control of the second enemy. Shoot the first enemy. What? Check out
[8638.63s -> 8653.42s]  the enemy to restore the time. How do I get out? Missed. Get back in his body. Get back in his
[8653.42s -> 8664.31s]  body. I'm a fucking time hacker. You can't kill me. Wait, how did I miss him? What the fuck? Until
[8664.31s -> 8672.02s]  the enemies spot us. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Each other to stop. Take control of
[8672.02s -> 8678.18s]  the point. The gun at the sec check out quickly. Take control of the second enemy. Shoot the first
[8678.18s -> 8683.86s]  enemy. Check out to restore the time. Take control of the main character or wait.
[8686.34s -> 8698.26s]  Oh, that's cool. That's really cool. All right, let's go. Oh shit.
[8699.94s -> 8734.78s]  Destroy the enemies on the level. Why is it slowing? I love this game. I love this game.
[8734.78s -> 8740.63s]  Destroy the enemies on the level. All right, I gotta get into this guy.
[8748.30s -> 8761.93s]  Got it. Nice. Oh, this is, this is fun. Oh my God. If the enemy is in a headset,
[8761.93s -> 8765.77s]  you can't control of him. Oh, I can't control that guy. I can do this though.
[8766.49s -> 8798.42s]  All right, now get in that guy. All right, get me out of here. I gotta get out. Got him. Fuck.
[8799.06s -> 8808.44s]  That was from Minecraft. That was from Minecraft.
[8812.74s -> 8820.26s]  If the enemy is in a headset, you can't take control of him. Holy shit. Okay, you and then you.
[8820.26s -> 8839.74s]  Do I just hit the head? Yes.
[8847.66s -> 8848.38s]  What the fuck?
[8848.38s -> 8853.18s]  Ruminant enemies can be grabbed and moved. Push the enemy into the turbine.
[8855.96s -> 8864.31s]  What the fuck? How do I push him in?
[8864.55s -> 8880.65s]  All right, you spin around. Headshot this guy. You shoot. Headshot this guy. Wait, where is he?
[8880.65s -> 8890.17s]  Oh, he's dead. Oh, fuck. You point the gun at your own head. Oh, no, I can't. Let go of the gun.
[8890.17s -> 8899.27s]  Shoot. Oh, that guy. I can't kill that guy. Oh, I think I'm dead. Wait, this guy. Wait,
[8899.27s -> 8914.12s]  shoot. Oh, that guy. I can't kill that guy. Oh, I think I'm dead. Wait, this guy.
[8915.40s -> 8941.05s]  We're kind of like Tony Hawk, this guy. Okay. Oh, I was trying to like hit him like his, you know.
[8942.01s -> 8963.56s]  All right, let's go. I can't do that. Why can't I do that? I'm just like a shell now. All right,
[8963.56s -> 8981.16s]  I can't. All right, hold on. I can't do that. It's time to die. All right, let's go. Get me out.
[8986.12s -> 9004.87s]  What? I pushed him in. Oh, my God. Okay. This is awesome. So, now what? Start. I don't know
[9004.87s -> 9013.88s]  what I'm starting. Oh, okay. Tutorials easy. Base tutorials. All right. So, I think I have to beat
[9013.88s -> 9035.88s]  these. What the? It's just us. Are you fucking kidding me? I can move the bullet out of the way?
[9036.60s -> 9070.55s]  Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. This is Quicksilver. No, give me that back. I'm going
[9070.55s -> 9129.05s]  to kill myself. Am I dead? No, I don't want to die. Is that going to do anything? Oh, shit. Okay. I

[9188.73s -> 9197.26s]  Put it down. Try and shoot this guy. No. What the fuck just happened? Okay. This is all right.
[9197.26s -> 9225.99s]  It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Get in his head. Are you kidding me? That's not a second.
[9225.99s -> 9260.68s]  What the fuck? That was so stupid. How do I kill this guy? I have to wait. Oh, fuck. I have to wait.
[9262.38s -> 9274.84s]  Wait. Can I? I can't pull him down. I can't manipulate him. But the barrel. The barrel can
[9274.84s -> 9308.68s]  float. All right. I should probably wait. I'm going to wait. No. Get over here. He's going to
[9308.68s -> 9321.83s]  miss me, right? Oh, shit. God damn it. All right. I got it. I got it. Is it going to hit them both?
[9321.83s -> 9353.02s]  Why is it doing that? Got it. This is so fucking fun. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. I missed. I
[9353.02s -> 9362.62s]  missed. I missed. I missed. I missed. I think I missed. But who kills this guy? He's going to
[9362.62s -> 9369.48s]  get me. All right. Hold on. Wait. There's a barrel over there. All right. I get it. There's
[9369.48s -> 9382.09s]  another barrel here. I got to think about this. OK. Go. OK. Give me this. He's going to get blown
[9382.09s -> 9388.46s]  by that. He's going to shoot this. OK. You shoot that. You shoot this one here. Shoot that one.
[9390.52s -> 9407.91s]  Now you shoot the barrel. Got it. Oh, that feels good when you get it right. Hold on. I got to
[9407.91s -> 9430.62s]  spin. Two more. One more. Oh, all right. OK. This one is. I'm really into this. This game's
[9430.62s -> 9443.53s]  actually really cool. Dynamite can be attached directly to enemies. Oh, my God. They're going to
[9443.53s -> 9470.07s]  have timer on them. Oh, shit. Give me that. OK. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What happened to his?
[9471.53s -> 9491.94s]  Wait. I didn't. I put it on his neck. Dynamite can be attached directly to enemies. One, two,
[9491.94s -> 9516.04s]  three. Good. That's good to know. They blow up. Holy shit. What? Can I drop a box on his head?
[9522.60s -> 9542.97s]  I don't know. I'm confused. Is there something here? What? Why is he? How do I turn it on?
[9551.35s -> 9572.26s]  OK. Banana peels can only be attached to the floor. Banana peels right under his foot. Like
[9572.26s -> 9593.26s]  right here. That was a really good like a pratfall. Give me that. Can I take the sword
[9593.26s -> 9611.72s]  out of his hand? Give me that. I can't. Let me have a gun. Oops. Wait. Can I get it now?
[9611.72s -> 9625.46s]  Oh, God damn it. What am I missing? Am I missing something? Oh, the. All right. There's a. OK.

[9647.03s -> 9668.28s]  Got it. What about be careful and dodge flying objects?
[9670.94s -> 9679.11s]  Wait. I don't think I dodged that. That happened so quickly.
[9679.11s -> 9686.31s]  Be careful and dodge flying objects. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no. Move.
[9695.02s -> 9699.10s]  What the fuck just happened? Where did I go?
[9701.38s -> 9729.13s]  Was that my body? I think that was my body. Where should I take this guy?
[9732.63s -> 9745.29s]  I think I've killed him already. Wait. Hold on. Is that going to? That's going to kill me.
[9746.01s -> 9773.85s]  Get back in my body. Quick. Oh, damn it. Whoa. We're good. No, no, I got to. What should I do?
[9774.73s -> 9809.88s]  Come here. OK. And then I didn't get him. Thank you, Freddy. What happened? What the fuck?
[9809.88s -> 9820.42s]  There's a helicopter. No, don't kill me. Holy shit. Who has a gun? Anybody have a gun?
[9820.42s -> 9845.83s]  Oh, boy. I need to go into my body quick. And then. Oh, shit. Is that going to hit him? Did I hit him?
[9847.03s -> 9857.67s]  I have to get all back over to my body. Oh, my God. I can't shoot that guy. I can't even
[9857.67s -> 9868.33s]  get out of this. I can't get out of this. That will click the button. I think I just lose.
[9869.05s -> 9883.80s]  Oh, well. OK. All right. I got to be ready for this. OK. Who has a gun? You shoot that guy.
[9884.76s -> 9894.94s]  Fuck. That's going to be the last thing I do then, right? I can't get back over there.
[9895.58s -> 9934.44s]  Teleport. Oh, my God. I forgot I had that. Oh, oh, my God. Nice. All right. What happened?
[9934.44s -> 9942.31s]  What happened with Freddy Dread? Say thank you to Freddy Dread right now. There's 50 subs from
[9942.31s -> 9956.47s]  Freddy. Thanks for the 50 good immunity subs, Freddy Dread. That's a lot of money. Thanks, dude.
[9957.67s -> 9960.15s]  The super contributor to the stream, Freddy Dread.
[9966.41s -> 9970.33s]  Rescue the hostages and don't forget to destroy your enemies.
[9971.05s -> 9985.75s]  Am I the only person? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. No. What? Rescue the hostages
[9985.75s -> 10010.66s]  and don't forget to destroy your enemies. Move. Yeah. Fail. How did I fail? How did I fail?

[10094.01s -> 10101.42s]  now you have to go just hang out over here for a second. Stay right there. You.
[10104.89s -> 10109.00s]  How do I kill him? How do I kill this guy?
[10115.50s -> 10140.78s]  That should do it, right? Oh, my bullshit. That was horseshit. Oh, help, help me. Oh, shit.
[10143.26s -> 10150.79s]  I can't get back up. Can I catch him? All right. I think I can catch him from here. No, I'm good.
[10153.03s -> 10190.79s]  No. Fuck. Teleport. Right. Sit down. Good. Oh, come on. You. I can't believe it's fucking my crap.

[10228.79s -> 10252.71s]  Got it. I love this game. Oh, God. Get. Come here. Oh, he's got a Vera helmet on. I can't kill him.
[10254.14s -> 10259.62s]  Oh, wait. Shooting was shooting missiles.
[10264.57s -> 10281.35s]  Am I good? I think that's it. Holy shit. Oh, boy. Oh, God. Let's do this one.
[10282.47s -> 10303.77s]  This is a hard level. What the fuck? Oh, my. Oh, my God. OK. Oh, shit. Who has a gun?
[10304.09s -> 10337.21s]  Are we good? I think I got it. I got it. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Who kills that guy? Who kills that guy?
[10342.68s -> 10367.16s]  I don't know who kills this guy. I think I'm dead. Oh, come on. Wait. What about the guy in the
[10367.16s -> 10404.74s]  helicopter? Oh, that shit kind of worked. I think I got it. I got it. I got it. That's it. I win.

[10531.83s -> 10552.62s]  That's going to zap him, right? Who is that not zapping? It's wrong. What was wrong? What happened?
[10552.62s -> 10575.38s]  I don't understand. I thought I did it right. I get it. No. I threw her across the map.
[10575.86s -> 10597.90s]  I just I tossed her across the map. How is she getting electrocuted? Come here. Sit in this chair.
[10599.48s -> 10629.19s]  All right. You're safe. Let's go. Done. We're good. All right. Let's do. All right. One more.
[10629.19s -> 10638.39s]  These ones. Time hacker. This is like my favorite game. Redirect the car by turning the steering
[10638.39s -> 10654.47s]  wheel. What? Are you serious? This is so stupid. Well, then how do I get him to die?
[10654.55s -> 10675.56s]  Wait. He's dead. That seems like that. OK. Whatever. I'm not going to. I'm not going to fucking
[10675.56s -> 10693.70s]  ask any questions. I've turned around so many times. We're good. We're good. I think. Hold on.
[10693.70s -> 10705.74s]  Let me make sure I didn't like pull the cord out. I think we're good. Yeah, we're good. All right.
[10705.74s -> 10721.46s]  Water time. All right. One more revolution. Holy. How many times did I turn around this way? Holy
[10721.46s -> 10780.12s]  shit. Water. All right. Go back in. Oh, how's it look? All right. Let's do it. Pull my pants up.
[10780.68s -> 10802.38s]  What's going on here? You shoot this guy in the head and then car. Oh shit. There's another guy.
[10802.94s -> 10813.64s]  Wait, I have an idea. Just hit him both with the car. All right. Let's do it. That should be good.
[10822.60s -> 10838.86s]  OK. All right. Last one and we're going to do another game.
[10839.10s -> 10875.80s]  Right there. Go. That should get him both. You get him. Oh my God. Come on, dude. What the fuck?
[10876.60s -> 10918.39s]  It's so stupid. OK. Let's do a different game. Let's do a different game. All right. What else
[10918.39s -> 10946.15s]  we got? This Space Channel 5. I have so many games. Oh no. I lost chat. Why did I lose chat?
[10946.15s -> 10971.80s]  Space Channel 5, baby. Ready Space Channel? What happened to chat? Hey, you guys aren't there
[10976.23s -> 10990.74s]  anymore. The chat window closed? No, it's here. Um, hold on. I'm going to actually, you know,
[10990.74s -> 10993.86s]  I'm going to take a break. It's been three hours. Holy shit. I've been playing for three hours.
[10994.74s -> 10999.21s]  Yeah, I'm going to take a quick break. I'm going to pee. Get some more water and we'll come back
[10999.21s -> 11433.77s]  with a Space Channel. Either that or maybe I'll pick one. Can you hear me? How are you doing? Good.
[11436.41s -> 11459.72s]  Oh, so let's do. I think I need a Space Channel. Dino Extinction. Turn the compressor off.
[11460.84s -> 11480.52s]  Is it too slow? Well, it's because I don't have the headset on right now. The headset's like
[11480.52s -> 11489.08s]  resting over here. It's fine. Yeah, I think it looks all right. All right. Space Channel. And
[11489.08s -> 11494.10s]  then, you know, let's do Dino Extinction. I think I want to play that one. Going back here in a
[11494.10s -> 11516.17s]  second. Getting back in. You'll see me very, very, very momentarily. Um, should I do? Yeah,
[11516.17s -> 11525.83s]  I want to play the Dinosaur game. Yeah, I have sentenced. I have a lot of games and I'm playing
[11525.83s -> 11535.96s]  VR like this. All right. Dino Eruption is what we're going to play. Time Hacker was a solid
[11535.96s -> 11542.84s]  experience. It was very, very much pleasantly supplied. I can't even talk. I can't even say
[11542.84s -> 11551.35s]  words. VR just takes so much out of you. I have the L.A. Noire VR files. I got a lot of stuff.
[11551.35s -> 11556.30s]  This is what we're doing for the... I'm streaming like three times this week. You're not just getting
[11556.30s -> 11563.14s]  one stream, Andy, here. I'm streaming today, tomorrow, and then probably Saturday or Sunday.
[11563.14s -> 11568.89s]  Probably Sunday. Or we're doing today and then like Saturday, Sunday. I haven't figured that out yet.
[11568.89s -> 11581.37s]  But I'm going to stream three times. Did I lose the chat again? There it is. All right. Dino
[11581.37s -> 11589.77s]  Eruption is what we're going to start with. If I can figure out how to get it to work. There we go.
[11589.77s -> 11603.00s]  Dino Eruption. Here we go. I can come back to you guys so you can see. And this is very tricky with
[11604.98s -> 11621.64s]  this. It should be working. Okay, there you are. Press and... What the fuck is all this?
[11622.60s -> 11640.57s]  Dino Eruption. Why is all this stuff all over my arms? Press and hold the marked button
[11641.21s -> 11657.50s]  for laser interactor. Press and hold the marked button while holding scan button. Press the grip
[11657.50s -> 11664.73s]  button to open menu. Wait, what? Holding scan button press. Oh, all right. There we go. How
[11664.73s -> 11678.30s]  are we doing? Adjust height. What the fuck was that? Set height. Okay. Your current height. One.
[11678.86s -> 11696.06s]  Your eye should be this high. A little more. All right. That looks good. Comfort options.
[11697.02s -> 11709.26s]  No vignette. What's with the vignette? The game is really quiet. I can help you out there.
[11709.82s -> 11726.79s]  Let me give you a hand there. Come on. There you go. All right. I'm ready. This game looked
[11726.79s -> 11736.33s]  very interesting. I am very much excited for this one. Here we go. How do I get the fuck out of here?
[11736.33s -> 11757.58s]  Okay. 100%. What is this? Zero times. So short he's off the screen. Juggles.
[11757.58s -> 11776.54s]  Juggles. Stop talking about my fat stomach. Is there like a play the game button? Titan
[11776.54s -> 11795.40s]  stomach. Stop it. The game sound. You're not in frame. I am now. Whoa. Juggles. This is not the
[11795.40s -> 11806.57s]  game. I need to like leave. There's probably a door. How do I get the fuck out of here? Wait,
[11806.57s -> 11837.77s]  menu. Start game. Press grip button to open menu. Where the fuck is that? Click the button. Do I
[11837.77s -> 11848.49s]  have to restart the game? B button on Oculus. Yeah, that's what I'm... Oh my... What? I just
[11848.49s -> 11864.81s]  pressed B. Okay. Fucking God. Touch marked button to move. Snap. Press the snap turn.
[11867.82s -> 11879.82s]  What is this music? Press marked button to activate laser. Wait, press to mark for laser
[11879.82s -> 11889.02s]  interactor? What the fuck? I don't know why that scared the shit out of me. That scared the
[11889.02s -> 11909.14s]  absolute shit out of me. My whole body hurts. What the fuck? Anime intro? Sly dash. Swing,
[11909.14s -> 11913.06s]  swing, swing, swing. Block, block, block, block. Cast magic. And then it cuts to like somebody.
[11913.06s -> 11916.10s]  Show me Cameron. Really close on a mountain and the guy's fucking face and leans in and he's
[11916.10s -> 11928.25s]  fucking got wind in his hair. Reach behind your head and release. All right. I'm scared. Oh,
[11929.21s -> 11936.76s]  I just realized what was happening. We're in a... I can't look out there. I can't look out that
[11936.76s -> 11945.37s]  window. I can't look out that window. I can't look out that window. Oh my God. Thank you for
[11945.37s -> 11951.82s]  coming in. Time is unfortunate. This guy's proportions are strange. Press marked button
[11951.82s -> 11960.60s]  to activate laser interactor. I don't know. I don't know what is... Press marked button
[11960.60s -> 11964.12s]  to use laser interactor. I know you've not been on my security detail for long,
[11964.12s -> 11971.19s]  but word has reached me of an impending threat to my family. I feel like I look like this guy.
[11971.19s -> 11979.22s]  I kind of have like a small head and really long arms. Okay. My wife is the head of an exclusive
[11979.22s -> 11984.50s]  facility that observes these creatures, some of which you see here displayed. Okay.
[11985.30s -> 11992.20s]  A facility that you should be parachuting down to in approximately two minutes. That's a long time.
[11992.84s -> 11997.94s]  Can we make it like 30 seconds? I have recently lost communication with my contacts there.
[11997.94s -> 12010.38s]  An auspicious sign given what is coming. I can't pick up your chairs. Your mission is to find her.
[12010.38s -> 12018.31s]  Dr. Layla Kessler. Protect her and get her to safety. You got it. And what will you be doing,
[12018.95s -> 12023.98s]  sir? Are these dinosaurs? What's the threat? What's the threat?
[12023.98s -> 12029.42s]  To put it concisely, I've received advanced reports of solar flares hitting the earth.
[12037.70s -> 12042.66s]  Normally, I'm told these things are not cause for worry, just flashing lights colliding with
[12042.66s -> 12047.54s]  earth's atmosphere. However, they do interfere with communications.
[12047.54s -> 12065.88s]  You'd like dinosaurs. Two minutes and 36 seconds. Okay. I guess we're waiting the two minutes
[12066.84s -> 12088.01s]  before I can leave. The last report recently stated they are getting vastly larger with a CME,
[12088.01s -> 12093.48s]  a giant solar eruption predicted. By now, it may have already happened.
[12093.48s -> 12103.51s]  Okay. You got it. I didn't work when I was over here.
[12103.51s -> 12109.75s]  When it arrives, this may wipe out all advanced electronics on earth. The facility below has
[12109.75s -> 12115.53s]  advanced electrical security systems to contain the research. The research?
[12116.63s -> 12123.37s]  Oh. So find my wife and get her to safety before the eruption hits.
[12123.37s -> 12130.47s]  Oh, find your wife. Okay. Before the eruption hits.
[12130.47s -> 12134.57s]  Time to jump. Time to jump.
[12134.57s -> 12138.41s]  Look at your arms. They will display any injuries. 100% health.
[12138.41s -> 12146.10s]  Interact with various electronic devices such as machinery and doors.
[12146.10s -> 12160.15s]  Whoa. How do I use it? Okay. I have a bow? You can practice further when on the ground.
[12160.15s -> 12165.11s]  Keep my wife safe. Now look around and go to the marker by the-
[12165.11s -> 12176.57s]  All right. Let's go. All right. I'm ready.
[12179.32s -> 12187.66s]  Press the marked button to equip bow. While holding the bow button,
[12187.66s -> 12193.34s]  point the laser on ammunition icon and press the left trigger button to choose your ammunition.
[12195.26s -> 12225.08s]  Okay. Did I do it? Did I get it? I like hear it. How is he doing that?
[12240.41s -> 12249.42s]  Okay. Press. Where is it? This music is so epic, but I can't fucking even do the tutorial.
[12255.45s -> 12275.00s]  How do I? Oh, shit. The weak spot.
[12275.00s -> 12283.19s]  Where's the weak spot? Right in his mouth. I swear to God. Just shoot him.
[12283.19s -> 12293.70s]  The weak spot. And where is the weak spot? Mr. So-
[12303.51s -> 12308.09s]  He's fucking dead. I killed that perfect crap. Using explosive robot arrows.
[12308.09s -> 12311.05s]  Explosive robot arrows? I can steer the robot using your
[12311.05s -> 12315.05s]  right touch pad or joystick, depending on your headset.
[12315.05s -> 12352.23s]  What? Where am I? What am I doing? What? Do I got him?
[12355.29s -> 12364.76s]  How? What did I just did? Okay. Press the what button to jump?
[12364.76s -> 12375.11s]  Press the joystick. Oh, you press it in. Okay. That thing's going to fucking explode, dude.
[12375.11s -> 12378.39s]  Why would I? We just like kept this guy in captivity so I could kill him with a bomb.
[12379.21s -> 12395.26s]  That was fucked up. Okay. Connect with laser. Laser detected. I have to jump out of that?
[12395.26s -> 12412.17s]  This seems like stupid. Hold on. Do I even have a parachute?
[12418.06s -> 12422.68s]  I don't think I have a parachute on. I'm just going to jump out of the fucking plane?
[12443.86s -> 12478.09s]  Was I supposed to do that? Whoa. I did turn around. What? Oh, shit. I made it. Okay.
[12478.73s -> 12486.90s]  Press the grip button to grab a round surface. Move controller to climb.
[12487.62s -> 12508.65s]  What can I help you with? Shit. Oh, man. I'm inside of it. What's going on?
[12508.65s -> 12518.54s]  Whoa. There's a dinosaur over there. What's happening?
[12518.62s -> 12526.62s]  What? Press the marked button to equip bow. What the fuck? Why is there a T-Rex over here?
[12526.62s -> 12533.94s]  What the fuck? Behind your shoulder, press the trigger button to grab an arrow.
[12533.94s -> 12552.52s]  I think I just blew myself up with a grenade. Print? Shit. Oh, he ate it?
[12555.91s -> 12564.26s]  Hold on. Heal. What do I need to do? I don't have any arrows. I don't have any arrows.
[12564.26s -> 12567.90s]  Do you have any arrows? You're talking to me now? We're in a bit of a daze there.
[12567.90s -> 12569.42s]  Figured I'd take you up to see the dock.
[12574.46s -> 12578.22s]  Fucking dinosaur. So, you're the rescue party? Where's the rest?
[12578.22s -> 12585.42s]  And press right trigger button to respond. He's talking. It's the dinosaur talking.
[12587.02s -> 12590.97s]  Thanks for the tutorial, T-Rex. I appreciate it, sonny.
[12590.97s -> 12596.01s]  Dr. Kessler said we have it under control. But, oh, I don't know. A little something with
[12596.01s -> 12604.38s]  giant teeth here tells me that might not be the whole story. Yeah. Anything else?
[12609.99s -> 12616.68s]  I love this. Come on. Continue. Anyway, your bow there is good for putting the smaller ones to
[12616.68s -> 12622.60s]  sleep. But I doubt it's going to help against our big friend here. What do you mean? Can that
[12622.60s -> 12634.46s]  T-Rex get to us? Where are your guns? Where are your guns, dude? Guns? Not here. It's an observation
[12634.46s -> 12640.89s]  facility, not a hunting range. If we have to, we use state-of-the-art electrical shockers,
[12640.89s -> 12645.29s]  force weapons, and... Force weapons. ...tranquilizers like your little bow there fires.
[12647.96s -> 12651.72s]  But I think this guy will need a bigger dosage than you got there.
[12651.72s -> 12660.66s]  And why is he on... How did he get on this rock? All right. I'll get... Oh, shit. It's food.
[12665.50s -> 12678.65s]  Why does he have like a big steak? Come here. Come here. Come get a steak. It's so stupid.
[12681.03s -> 12689.58s]  I can't print any more steaks? Where's the doctor? She's just up ahead of the backup
[12689.58s -> 12695.90s]  generator facility. He's freaking me out. I was just admiring this guy. I heard you can distract
[12695.90s -> 12701.91s]  them with a bit of food. Sure. He looks distracted. He's like, yes, you can. I'm very distractible by
[12701.91s -> 12712.06s]  food. He's correct. What is he doing? Okay. I was going to make some with the generator there
[12712.06s -> 12717.42s]  and feed it to him so we can get by without any worry. Shall I give it a go?
[12722.42s -> 12735.61s]  Sure. Show me. All right. Let's give this a go. Are you walking like that? Why is he walking like
[12735.61s -> 12758.36s]  this? Why would you ever get this close? His shoes. His shoes came off. His shoes came off.
[12758.36s -> 12766.22s]  Press the marked button to equip. What? Reach behind your shoulder and press trigger button
[12766.22s -> 12776.04s]  to grab it. Eat this motherfucker. These dinosaurs think they can roam the fucking earth again.
[12776.04s -> 12792.39s]  Not on my watch. So what? That guy's just gone. Am I stuck here? I think the whole thing is
[12792.39s -> 12800.63s]  fucked up because that guy is like, oh my God. Everything about that was fucking amazing.
[12801.43s -> 12816.54s]  Um, can I get out of here? This is like the, this is like the Disney rides and the universal rides
[12817.10s -> 12821.58s]  from like back in the nineties and the eighties where you could literally be going that way.
[12821.58s -> 12828.01s]  And King Kong is right there and you turn and King Kong is right here too. It's like, oh,
[12828.01s -> 12837.38s]  there he is. King Kong fucking scary. And he, oh, okay. Reach behind your shoulder and grab.
[12837.86s -> 12856.82s]  I don't have any, I don't have any arrows. Where am I? Use laser to print. Okay.
[12858.74s -> 12867.66s]  Oh shit. Arrows. Do they get them? Arrows stored. Thank you. Okay. What about in here?
[12871.83s -> 12885.62s]  What the fuck is that? Why do I hear that? Bombs stored. Bombs stored. Can I get in?
[12889.14s -> 12905.90s]  Is that the T-Rex making that noise? Your health has been restored. Oh, okay. Is that
[12905.90s -> 12935.40s]  a bad guy? Jump, jump. What happened? What happened? Why did that happen? I'm so confused.
[12936.66s -> 12952.42s]  Hold on. Why were they, we keeping it in there? What is that? Okay. I want the bow. No, put this.
[12952.42s -> 12971.93s]  Give me, give me, give me, give me. Not this again. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[12972.33s -> 12985.40s]  Dr. Kessler. Okay. She's just at the backup generator. I've gotten bigger somehow. Show
[12985.40s -> 13004.60s]  me how to feed him again. Don't do it. Don't do it. You're so much work. Your life is so much
[13004.60s -> 13029.46s]  worth living for. Help. Press the marked button to equip bow. Why can I throw this shit? All right.
[13029.46s -> 13034.66s]  Get me the fuck out of here. No, I'm getting out of here. I need, I want to go down.
[13046.86s -> 13052.46s]  Okay. So behind the backup generator is where I need to go. I'm ready to try that or attempt it.
[13053.18s -> 13060.09s]  Okay. Something exploded in here and I don't know what the hell it was.
[13061.70s -> 13070.73s]  I don't know. Something, it was like a bomb. That fucking dinosaur.
[13071.61s -> 13077.77s]  Uh, arrows stored. I'm not leaving this one yet. No fucking way. Not a chance.
[13078.65s -> 13085.86s]  Bombs stored. Bombs stored. Your health has been restored. Okay. Here we go.
[13109.42s -> 13116.01s]  I need to refill my health. Open. Oh God. Come on. All right. Well, whatever.
[13116.73s -> 13124.41s]  I need to equip the bow. First of all, I got to back up. I'm way too close.
[13125.05s -> 13134.71s]  Arrows stored. I also have to spin around. I'm so tangled. All right. What does this do?
[13135.35s -> 13159.45s]  Connect with laser. Let go. What did it do? Laser detected. I have no idea. Okay. There are
[13159.45s -> 13186.41s]  dinosaurs here. Do I have to do anything with them? Why am I going up here? That was so pointless.
[13186.41s -> 13223.99s]  For what? Okay. I'm getting down. That hurt me that much. This ain't baseball.
[13224.71s -> 13240.86s]  It's a petroterricitia. I feel like you can get out of here. What the fuck?
[13241.82s -> 13270.49s]  It was an eagle. That's not, I want that. I want those. They're not doing anything.
[13276.95s -> 13290.14s]  Arrows stored. Can I pet them? Hello. Yes. You're such a good boy. Stegosaurus. Come here.
[13290.14s -> 13302.70s]  Come here. What's this one? Oh, it's like, it's an armadillo one. Hello. Okay. Where am I going now?
[13302.70s -> 13316.71s]  I can't believe that guy got fucking eaten. What's happening over there? What is going on over
[13316.71s -> 13335.05s]  there? Hold on. Did one escape? I wish I could move faster than this. You walk like you've been
[13335.05s -> 13349.54s]  drinking. I'll take care of the dinosaur. Don't worry. That's true. I am just like,
[13349.54s -> 13386.57s]  should have lopped it around. Okay. Okay. Am I launching a missile? Oh no. He turned into
[13386.57s -> 13403.05s]  wood. He didn't even eat it. You're welcome. All right. I think I got to go that way.
[13405.29s -> 13423.35s]  He's freaking me out. He can't get over that fence, right? Okay. I kind of need to see what
[13423.35s -> 13435.29s]  else can happen in this game. Yeah. 19% health, 13 arrows. So is it kind of just like a Jurassic
[13435.29s -> 13467.24s]  park where you just walk around and look at the animals? What's with my hands? Why is she
[13467.32s -> 13474.31s]  fucking tiny? Hi. You must be my husband's newest security edition.
[13474.31s -> 13476.15s]  Hope you'll last longer than your predecessor.
[13482.92s -> 13486.12s]  Oh, no. What do I do?
[13495.66s -> 13507.43s]  Can I feed her to the fucking T-Rex? Please, please let me feed her. Let me feed her to the T-Rex.
[13512.89s -> 13526.47s]  No, no, no. Oh, God damn it. Fuck you. We already know what happens to you. Get him out of here.
[13531.58s -> 13545.75s]  Why am I getting taller? Oh my God. Get me out of here. I can't believe. Oh, God damn it.
[13546.78s -> 13552.46s]  I wanted to bring her over here and feed her to the T-Rex. All right. I don't care about what the
[13552.62s -> 13558.22s]  I don't care about this game at all. I care about feeding that lady to a dinosaur. I don't care
[13558.22s -> 13593.06s]  about anything else. Arrows stored. Okay. Let's go open it. Beach behind your shoulder and press
[13593.06s -> 13631.14s]  trigger. Different monster in here. Fuck it. I'm just going up there. I'm good. I'm back. She keeps
[13631.14s -> 13675.86s]  getting smaller. Yes. I am the new recruit. Every time I kill, I grow in size. So fucking bizarre.
[13675.86s -> 13688.10s]  Oh my God. Dude, that's just, this is just not cool. Oh my God. Let go. Let go. I just,
[13688.10s -> 13693.26s]  I gotta bring her over there and I gotta get her over the fence. Her neck.
[13698.07s -> 13701.43s]  I just gotta get her over the fence. If I can throw her far enough. If he eats her.
[13701.99s -> 13708.01s]  Okay. Place your bets. If he eats her, this is, I mean, this is gonna be the funniest thing ever.
[13709.67s -> 13725.70s]  Oh, hold on. My underwear is coming up. All right. Can I do this?
[13732.70s -> 13776.58s]  Shit. I need to. Damn it. No, I'm fine. I'm alive. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this.
[13777.14s -> 13797.35s]  Too heavy. Wait, what about one of these guys? Why do they keep getting smaller? I don't understand.
[13797.35s -> 13814.18s]  I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can. I think she's too heavy. Wait. Ah, shit. I gotta
[13814.18s -> 13860.98s]  kill this guy. Where is he? Where is he? I think. Break forward. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[13860.98s -> 13915.75s]  go, go, go, go. What the fuck? I'm kicking in. I can't bring her. I can't. Fuck. I just see what
[13915.75s -> 13932.02s]  she wants. Let me die. Hold on. Just die. Just die. Just die. I'm so disappointed. I can't take her.
[13932.02s -> 13951.10s]  Fuck. Why am I still alive? Press the marked button to equip bow. Now you were in a bit of
[13951.10s -> 13958.70s]  a daze there. I'm gonna be as big as you real soon. Press marked button. Laser interactor.
[13958.70s -> 13974.68s]  Oh my god. Every time. This is important. Hold on. Hold on a second. I need to die like 10 more
[13974.68s -> 13981.83s]  times because I want to be like so much bigger. I don't think I can even leave. All right,
[13981.83s -> 13988.22s]  we'll just feed him already. So you the rescue party? Dr. Kessler said we have it under control.
[13988.22s -> 13993.74s]  Anyway, you're little. Well, we had a power out and don't worry, the backup kicked in.
[13993.74s -> 13997.90s]  Though I heard one or two of the dinos did get out of. I assume that's why you were here.
[13999.43s -> 14008.55s]  Okay. Actually, she's just. I'm getting like winded. I was just admiring this guy. I'm getting
[14008.55s -> 14014.62s]  winded. I might have to stop. I'm starting to get like seasick. But I have to power through
[14014.62s -> 14026.36s]  because I have to see this one more time. Let's give this a go. Get in his way. Don't do it.
[14036.76s -> 14046.02s]  What's happening? I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke.
[14046.02s -> 14080.20s]  I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. Give me a sec. Yeah, I gotta stop.
[14081.22s -> 14087.62s]  In my view, the world like just got disconnected and I almost just fucking instantly threw up.
[14088.58s -> 14102.57s]  Oh my god. That was fucking funny. The audio. I know.
[14107.64s -> 14114.97s]  All right. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to call it here because like, yeah,
[14114.97s -> 14118.33s]  I'm actually starting to get like sick. I don't know what was about that game, but it did it.
[14119.13s -> 14123.05s]  So I'll be back here tomorrow. We're going to continue to go through the VR catalog.
[14125.69s -> 14135.16s]  Why can you shoot the people with the bow and arrow? Why is it like Dark Souls? Why can you
[14135.24s -> 14147.85s]  kill NPCs? Oh my god. So tomorrow, I think we're going to open with Space Channel 5.
[14148.41s -> 14153.69s]  Then maybe we're going to do some L.A. to more VR case files. And then we're going to do
[14155.21s -> 14158.17s]  Sentenced, which is an executioner game. I promise I have eyebrows.
[14159.13s -> 14166.97s]  And we'll go from there. But yeah, that's the end of that. Air check. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[14167.93s -> 14197.46s]  How do I look? Sam and Max VR? Is that out? I didn't know that was even out.
[14203.96s -> 14214.71s]  I'll get it. Red from Scooby Doo. Well, some of these games were really fun. Boneworks was
[14214.71s -> 14220.07s]  cool. It just, I don't know, it was kind of, it wasn't grabbing me. It wasn't grabbing me.
[14221.18s -> 14224.86s]  The first like 15 to 20 minutes, I was having like kind of a good time, but it was just,
[14224.86s -> 14228.46s]  I don't know, maybe a little too slow for me. Or maybe like I really need to put like a few
[14228.46s -> 14236.70s]  hours into it. But I've had a blast. Baseball game was fucking awesome. Time Hacker was
[14237.42s -> 14244.82s]  hilarious. VR really is so much fun. But it just, it just annihilates me. I just get so tired.
[14246.20s -> 14250.44s]  So that's why we're going tomorrow. Let's take a shower, freshen up. I'll see you guys back here
[14250.44s -> 14260.15s]  same time. Four o'clock Pacific. You guys soon? Can't hear me. I'm trying to lean in.
[14265.48s -> 14284.76s]  I'll see you tomorrow. Can I get the subs to come up? I can. Look at that. Scammed bet. Well,
[14284.76s -> 14294.66s]  I couldn't do it. I didn't do it, obviously, right? I'm really disappointed that the,
[14295.54s -> 14299.32s]  I don't know what happened to it, but I'm going to like disconnect all the wires.
[14301.24s -> 14306.04s]  That left ear thing is really disappointing. I really hope it's not just a bad cable or something.
[14307.00s -> 14311.24s]  Because I have dinged it a few times. I have like punched it a little bit, just like the left side.
[14311.24s -> 14318.68s]  You saw me do it. But I don't think that should be enough to kill the left hearing in the headset.
[14325.51s -> 14327.51s]  Update. Yeah, I'll do the firmware thing and see if that's a problem.
[14335.98s -> 14339.34s]  I've smashed mine into a wall before. Yeah, these things are usually pretty hardy.
[14341.54s -> 14347.62s]  My Vive fell off my head flying down into the ground. I have smashed that thing so many times.
[14348.34s -> 14368.74s]  But I'll check the cables. I'll get the update. What's your opinion on VR Zorn?
[14371.74s -> 14376.78s]  I've never done VR Zorn. I'm terrified to do it. I talked about this in another VR stream,
[14376.78s -> 14384.89s]  and I'll make it really, really clear again. VR porn is one of those things where anybody that
[14384.89s -> 14390.17s]  you know that could possibly come to your house, or that you possibly are around, you need to make
[14390.17s -> 14394.57s]  sure that they're on vacation. Because being inside of this headset and being there,
[14395.53s -> 14399.61s]  and you have to be absolutely fucking certain that no one is going to show up.
[14400.49s -> 14404.57s]  And I mean, like, if you know that, like, everybody in your household, like, is on vacation,
[14405.21s -> 14408.65s]  FaceTime them to make sure that it's proven before you get in.
[14409.45s -> 14413.59s]  Like, oh, just checking on this thing. I'm going to FaceTime you like a mom and dad.
[14413.59s -> 14418.63s]  Yeah, so how like, show me around Italy. Okay, they're still in fucking Italy. There's no way
[14418.63s -> 14421.03s]  they're going to come home. There's no way they're going to see me jerking off in my fucking
[14421.59s -> 14428.09s]  VR headset. No possible way, right? It's so vulnerable in there. I wouldn't want to know.
[14428.09s -> 14438.62s]  I don't want to do that. Lock the door. No, but why is your door locked? Son, what's the what's
[14438.62s -> 14444.78s]  with it? Why was the door locked? Oh, by the way, how are you going to hear that? If somebody tries
[14444.78s -> 14449.99s]  to come in your locked door, you're immersed in VR Zorn. How are you going to hear that? They're
[14449.99s -> 14453.19s]  going to get like the fire department there because they're scared. They're going to break
[14453.19s -> 14459.54s]  your door down and the fire department's going to see you in there. Fucking fully nude in VR. No,
[14459.54s -> 14469.02s]  everybody had don't you have to make sure that no one will ever be around. Like he accidentally
[14469.02s -> 14474.50s]  locked himself in the door in the room. Are you in there? Hello? Knock, knock, knock. It's where are
[14474.50s -> 14494.46s]  you? You're immersed completely. Your headsets are open ear. Well, depends on how loud you're
[14494.46s -> 14507.18s]  listening. I'm fucking out of here. I'm sorry. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow. We'll open with
[14507.18s -> 14577.62s]  Space Channel 5 tomorrow. See you guys later. Take care of yourselves and goodbye.
