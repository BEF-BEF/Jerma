[2.04s -> 13.46s]  Hello everybody. Hello. Where is he? It's only been like one minute. Come on, I'm a little slow today.
[14.26s -> 31.40s]  The gas is empty. My car needs to be filled up. Oh, he's a little short today, a little. Yeah,
[31.40s -> 40.14s]  just a little bit. So, uh, last night I did mention that, you know, depending on how I
[40.14s -> 47.99s]  woke up, I had some things to do tomorrow, but if I got up and I was alright then we were
[47.99s -> 53.38s]  gonna go and so we're gonna go. We're good. Sunday stream, hope you're having a good afternoon.
[53.38s -> 60.20s]  Hope you got some sleep after last night. I did. A little bit of a hangover, but it's okay. We're
[60.20s -> 70.86s]  gonna play Sam and Max. We're gonna relax. We're gonna finish up season one. Only one episode
[70.86s -> 87.67s]  remains. We'll see how long this takes. You said it little buddy. And then depending on,
[87.75s -> 94.33s]  maybe season two, maybe start episode one or maybe wait, maybe play some more at how
[94.33s -> 101.10s]  this is gonna be one of those streams where we just chill and do whatever. After last night,
[101.10s -> 114.09s]  I need a, uh, I need a relaxing stream. Alright, so I got everything ready to go.
[114.81s -> 121.51s]  Oh shit, it is Cinco. Yeah, it's Cinco de Mayo. I drank on the wrong day.
[126.60s -> 137.10s]  Oops. Well, anyways, that's alright. No, I am not drinking again today. No.
[139.03s -> 148.62s]  I need a two to three week cool down period in between every time I drink. Hey, you've seen
[148.62s -> 157.21s]  that before. I have to get to do some audio stuff. May the fifth of vodka be with you.
[158.01s -> 166.38s]  No, don't give me this hair of the dog bullshit. No way. That's like, that's a crock of shit.
[166.38s -> 175.91s]  I'll tell you that much. Ready? Why on earth? What in any scenario would you drinking booze
[175.99s -> 182.06s]  make you feel better after drinking booze all day or all night? No, it just like,
[182.06s -> 187.64s]  it just fucks your brain up more and it just locks you down. It just puts you back into
[187.64s -> 201.85s]  being drunk again. No, it's water, potassium, you know, coconut water, pedialyte, just hydrate.
[201.85s -> 205.29s]  Don't like take a shot of whiskey when you get up in the morning. Don't do that.
[205.29s -> 216.12s]  Alright, so let's go. How loud is it? Not bad. Uh, I had to do some video game
[216.12s -> 220.28s]  tap. I remember that company, which is why every citizen will find a complimentary
[220.28s -> 232.39s]  government issued in the mailbox. Get to spray in America. Eat this mother up.
[232.39s -> 236.79s]  That building was really close. An announcement from the president of the United States.
[238.57s -> 242.89s]  I forgot he's president, right? You missed your cue. What? Oh, sorry, little buddy in
[242.89s -> 247.29s]  chief. I'm still thinking about our last case. Little buddy in chief said it was working for
[247.29s -> 253.77s]  somebody named Roy G. Ben. That's what you guys call me. But for who or who? We're detectives,
[253.77s -> 258.25s]  Sam, not mind readers. Hey, maybe we should ask you bliss mind readers. That's it.
[259.13s -> 262.73s]  No, that's not it. By the way, have you seen my copy of a medics,
[262.73s -> 268.33s]  the handbook for multicolored happiness by hue bliss colors? No, think Max. Think. Well,
[268.33s -> 272.73s]  I know I had it this morning. That's it morning in the ancient tongue of the mud
[272.73s -> 277.05s]  worshipping kapala who tech tribe of the Serengeti. Our word morning means he who
[277.05s -> 282.09s]  destroys the hypnotic rainbow man. That's the word he fears the most. So this Roy G.
[282.09s -> 287.29s]  Biv is the one person we've met who's never said the word morning. That means it's,
[288.41s -> 294.25s]  it's the commission. I never did trust him. No chowder head. It's hue bliss.
[296.01s -> 300.01s]  No commissioner. I didn't mean look, I need you to put out an APB on hue bliss.
[300.01s -> 304.81s]  Yeah, Max is still president as of now by the Greek goddess Selena and a chariot with dual
[304.81s -> 310.33s]  overhead cams and silver Fox mud flaps. We're on our way. Let's go. Max. The commissioner
[310.33s -> 314.41s]  said that hue bliss is currently staying at his exclusive prismatology retreat,
[314.41s -> 318.81s]  the blister of tranquility. Oh boy. I bet it's somewhere really cool and exotic,
[318.81s -> 322.57s]  like a remote island in the South Pacific or Des Moines. Even farther, pal.
[323.37s -> 332.42s]  The game is quiet. It shouldn't be. I'll turn it up. Oh, it's German moon. German moon.
[333.14s -> 349.62s]  Why is his face on the moon? How's the hangover? It's all right. It's not terrible.
[350.26s -> 357.70s]  I woke up looking down. It was like four to five on the 10 point hangover skill.
[359.27s -> 370.94s]  We've diminished down to about three. I'm good. Just a little slow. Bright side of the moon.
[373.85s -> 379.21s]  You woke up covered in cardboard and wine. Back on the moon, doesn't it? We made good time too.
[379.21s -> 383.13s]  We've still got plenty of generic brand powdered orange flavor drink mix left.
[383.13s -> 386.97s]  You always did know how not to infringe on a registered trademark, little buddy.
[386.97s -> 391.77s]  What are we doing first, Sam? Let's locate the blister of tranquility. Find out what hue bliss
[391.77s -> 396.33s]  is up to and arrest his unprincipled magical butt. Is that a visitor center?
[397.29s -> 407.38s]  Is there a center on the moon? Hey, don't scoff at that. Eventually you're gonna be able to go to
[407.38s -> 412.81s]  the moon for free. That's right. There's gonna be just a train you can take from here to the
[412.81s -> 423.98s]  moon. Not gonna cost any money. It's gonna be old news in like 100 years. All right,
[423.98s -> 429.02s]  Harry. Wait, wasn't this the- Well, well. Aren't you Teddy Bear? Once upon a time,
[429.02s -> 436.57s]  but no longer. Wasn't this person way bigger? This dude was like 10 feet tall.
[440.46s -> 445.66s]  How would a train work? Just lay train tracks down to the moon. It's gonna be like an Elon Musk
[445.66s -> 454.65s]  bullet train. They'll be floating moon beams or something. Doesn't matter. They're reusing assets.
[454.65s -> 460.65s]  Who are you now? I've gone back to being Harry Mole Man. Or should I say I've gone forward?
[460.65s -> 464.73s]  Prismatology has helped me find a new me where the old one used to be.
[465.53s -> 470.20s]  Prismatology. So this, that's the whole mind control thing. It's been hue bliss the whole
[470.20s -> 479.48s]  time. You see, yeah, there we go. You seem shorter than you used to. Tiny. I used to
[479.48s -> 486.68s]  use that exoskeleton, but Prismatology has taught me that size doesn't matter. Color does. Harry
[486.68s -> 492.44s]  Mole Man will never be sensitive about being diminutive again. Or about referring to himself
[492.44s -> 499.96s]  in the third person apparently. And also you explode in that whole factory. Prismatology helped
[499.96s -> 504.84s]  me put Harry Mole Man back together again. Looks like it may have left out a few pieces
[504.84s -> 513.85s]  by mistake. Oh, hold on. Streamlabs windows in the wrong spot. Are you still a criminal?
[513.85s -> 519.37s]  Are you still a notorious criminal? Or an obscure one like Kevin Mitnick? No. I don't know
[519.37s -> 524.09s]  who that is. I've postulated my lemma since Prismatology found me. It's the straight and
[524.09s -> 532.17s]  narrow for Harry Mole Man from here on out. All right. Well, I guess it's nice to see you again.
[532.17s -> 536.09s]  Actually, I'm still a little sore that he tried to get you to shoot me last time we
[536.09s -> 541.69s]  saw him. I'm channeling my saturation towards making amends for my past transgressions.
[541.69s -> 546.57s]  Prismatology has taught me. Yeah, yeah, we get it. So is Prismatology like a
[547.21s -> 553.22s]  take on Scientology? Is that kind of what the deal is here? All right. Where's Mr.
[553.22s -> 559.38s]  Hugh Bliss? Seen Hugh Bliss around here lately? To see the master I need only search my heart.
[559.38s -> 564.66s]  I meant see him in the traditional fashion. No. Windows. He's usually in the blister these days.
[565.30s -> 571.40s]  Okay, so where's the blister? Which way to the blister of tranquility? Enlightenment
[571.40s -> 575.88s]  is the only way to reach the blister of tranquility. How about we enlighten your
[575.88s -> 580.20s]  skull a little? Would that work? The blister is through that little box right over there.
[581.24s -> 586.12s]  Little box, all right. See you later. We've got important sightseeing to do.
[586.12s -> 593.91s]  Great! That's what we got, huh? Wait, wait. Okay, so this is the blister of tranquility.
[594.79s -> 598.23s]  Let's this guy back again. Wait, didn't we fire this guy? No, he went on vacation.
[600.39s -> 607.02s]  Hold on. What's a hypno beam display? Let's just look. What's supposed to go here?
[607.02s -> 611.90s]  These hypnotic goggles were an early prototype of the hypno beam technology currently being
[611.90s -> 617.50s]  used to further the worldwide goals of Prismatology. Wow! Invisible goggles!
[617.50s -> 621.74s]  The goggles were stolen a few months ago. Honestly, some people will take anything
[621.74s -> 630.17s]  that's not bolted to the floor. So, all right. What is this thing? Can I pick up a spoon? What's
[630.17s -> 636.25s]  this? Looks like a bent spoon with some peanut butter on it. The power to bend and rebend spoons
[636.25s -> 641.29s]  stored within this completely indestructible magical talisman was among the first mental
[641.29s -> 646.97s]  abilities to be developed and popularized by Hugh Bliss. Big deal! I can bend spoons with my
[646.97s -> 654.89s]  bare hands. One question, would it work on wrenches? Yeah, a wrench is close enough.
[654.89s -> 660.41s]  Interesting, interesting. Ah, you made me forget where I was. Let's see. Indestructible
[660.41s -> 666.57s]  magical talismans. Oh, yeah. The virtually indestructible display case is a triumph of
[666.57s -> 670.73s]  modern Prismatological science. So smash it, textbook. Virtually indestructible?
[670.73s -> 675.37s]  Extensive testing has been done on the case, showing it to be impervious to bullets, acid,
[675.45s -> 680.57s]  high falls, crushing force, sonic weaponry, diamond chip drills, hurricanes, poisons,
[680.57s -> 685.21s]  cynicism, and liquid nitrogen. Don't touch it, you might break it. Oops,
[685.21s -> 695.75s]  it's not held down very securely. No, let it break. Okay, so, yeah, how are they breathing?
[696.47s -> 703.24s]  There's no oxygen on the moon. What's with the chart? I bet it shows how Justin Timberlake
[703.24s -> 707.96s]  is descended from the moon people. This chart outlines Hugh Bliss's ingenious master
[707.96s -> 711.80s]  plan to hypnotize everyone on earth through connections with the U.S. government,
[711.80s -> 715.96s]  the internet, and the toy mafia. Well, that was close. That was a boomer joke.
[717.56s -> 721.64s]  You're right, I was. I wonder why I didn't know anything about this at the time.
[722.28s -> 726.15s]  Have you ever been to the moon? Have you ever been to the moon?
[727.03s -> 731.03s]  So you can't tell me what's there. You don't know what's there. You've just been
[731.03s -> 742.44s]  shown things on TV. You know what else is shown on TV? Dragons. And fire. Are dragons real?
[742.44s -> 747.88s]  All right, I'm doing like a moon isn't real thing and I don't really want to be the guy that
[747.88s -> 763.56s]  says that. The moon banger? What does this thing say?
[764.04s -> 766.76s]  While I was looking at your beautiful ceiling architecture.
[766.76s -> 773.08s]  What mafia? Don't try that again. I'll have to get ugly. I guess a lot of people have done it
[773.08s -> 779.74s]  already. Yes, but I always. Okay. All right, so we got to find a way to get by this.
[782.92s -> 789.56s]  So he's going to frisk to somehow get that out of here without him frisking us or without
[789.56s -> 800.66s]  him finding it somehow. Let me look around. There's the lunar lander. This is ours.
[801.14s -> 809.37s]  No, wait, what? It's a lunar lander. So is my aunt Tilly, but they can't prove anything.
[810.49s -> 818.04s]  It's a lunar lander. No, that wasn't an undertale reference, guys. Not everything is an
[818.04s -> 823.94s]  undertale reference. Lovely shirt. Can I get one Sam? Can I, can I, can I, can I?
[823.94s -> 829.83s]  You don't wear shirts, Max. I can still accumulate them, can't I? One moment,
[829.83s -> 836.25s]  please. What the hell? I didn't do anything. Okay, go ahead. So we have to get him to run
[836.25s -> 844.70s]  away somehow. He's going to be like, there's a slightly beat up robotic exoskeleton. I have
[844.70s -> 853.38s]  to go to the bathroom. They all have to go to the bathroom. We'll just get like the,
[853.38s -> 858.95s]  give him a soda. He'll just pee. All right. Well, what's going on with you? What's Superball?
[858.95s -> 864.15s]  Hey, small worlds. It's our favorite cabinet secretary and secret service man, agent Superball.
[864.15s -> 868.39s]  Favorite? That'd be like choosing a favorite child, Sam. I love them all.
[869.03s -> 869.91s]  It's Tuesday already?
[877.91s -> 879.27s]  I do like, I do like the tie.
[898.39s -> 905.35s]  What's a level red prismatologist? Level red is apex of prismatology, sir. You'd have to
[905.35s -> 910.63s]  undergo spectrum analysis to determine your current level. Spectrum analysis. Is that where
[910.63s -> 914.55s]  you lie perfectly still in a lead coffin while brightly colored cotton swabs are inserted
[914.55s -> 921.96s]  into various orifices? No, sir. We gave it up in 87. It's much simpler now. So let's
[921.96s -> 926.04s]  try it. What is it? Yep. We're level red. Let us in. I'm sure you're mistaken, but we'll
[926.04s -> 931.56s]  run the spectrum analysis anyway. Take this. A unicorn? What am I supposed to do with this?
[931.56s -> 941.69s]  Rub it, sir. Rub it, Sam. Harder. Hard. I'm sorry, sir. The unicorn says you're yellow.
[941.69s -> 946.73s]  No one calls us yeller. Draw, partner. Level yellow is frankly rather pathetic, sir.
[946.73s -> 952.09s]  Only level reds may enter the retreat. Regulations? Hmm. However, you bliss would
[952.09s -> 956.17s]  like to keep the unicorn as a token of his love. Rub it often to measure your progress
[956.17s -> 968.55s]  towards true bliss. I got paint. Do I still have to get paint? You do that. Okay. How does
[968.55s -> 974.15s]  the unicorn work? How does that unicorn work, anyway? By magic, sir. Right. Either that or it's
[974.15s -> 979.03s]  just a glorified mood ring that reacts to body heat. Or that. It's got a heated up ring.
[979.03s -> 986.46s]  You're not a believer, sir. I could never explain it to you. That works, too. Why are
[986.46s -> 991.82s]  you studying this prismatology, too? Not studying. I've mastered it. You mastered
[991.82s -> 996.54s]  prismatology by standing in front of a door? I am one with the door. We exist in the indigo
[996.54s -> 999.02s]  wavelength of reality. I thought this was a kid's game. The door is an illusion.
[1000.06s -> 1009.80s]  So long, Superball. Get out of here. Do I still have paint? So heat. I need to heat this up
[1009.80s -> 1025.27s]  so it gets red. We go back to the town, right? Yeah, so let's see if I can heat
[1025.27s -> 1035.34s]  this up. What, put it on a grill or something? Go to Bosco's? Earth. It looks cleaner from far away.
[1037.90s -> 1045.99s]  That it does. That it does. How does it do that when there's no wind on the moon?
[1046.55s -> 1057.38s]  All right, let's head back. I got my item that I need. Come on. Go, go, go.
[1058.42s -> 1063.85s]  Where are we headed now, Sam? We are going to the Earth. Terra firma. Does it actually show
[1063.85s -> 1073.10s]  you go there? Drive the car in space? No, I was going to say that would be really funny.
[1077.14s -> 1082.01s]  All right. Well, what is the final thing that they're doing? Let's check on Sybil.
[1083.32s -> 1099.37s]  See, the new is just called Queen. The Canada Leaf? What's with the Canada Leaf? Relax, A.
[1100.33s -> 1109.50s]  Okay. Hiya, Sybil. Hello, Sam. Hello, Max. But we prefer to be addressed by our official
[1109.50s -> 1115.90s]  title. Is Sybil hearing the voices again? The people, the people. You feeling all right,
[1115.90s -> 1123.58s]  Sybil? You bet we are. We just got the best job ever. We are the Queen of Canada. Queen of
[1123.58s -> 1128.82s]  Canada. I always thought Rush was the Queen of Canada. How does that work? Queen of Canada?
[1128.82s -> 1132.98s]  How'd you land that gig? Did you find half of an old locket dripping with syrup and
[1132.98s -> 1138.18s]  bacon grease hinting at a long forgotten lineage? Nothing that interesting, we're afraid.
[1138.74s -> 1144.02s]  We answered a classified ad. Yeah, the Canadians are practical that way.
[1144.02s -> 1148.34s]  They've been looking for a figurehead to give the country a little bit more class.
[1148.34s -> 1155.85s]  They said we were the perfect candidate. Can, L-U-L? That doesn't even work.
[1156.73s -> 1170.89s]  There's no like L or O or that's not, that doesn't even connect at all well, even remotely.
[1177.27s -> 1182.79s]  But you're not Canadian. How does this work? Heck no, but we took two quarters of French in
[1182.79s -> 1189.59s]  college and we spelled, hello, will you? If not knowing how to spell is enough to become royalty,
[1189.59s -> 1195.19s]  I could become President of the United States. You are President of the United States, Max.
[1195.19s -> 1198.63s]  By God, you're right, Sam. How come I'm not bombing anything right now?
[1199.27s -> 1207.18s]  Plus, we were the only candidate. What are your duties here? What kind of stuff does the
[1207.18s -> 1211.90s]  Queen of Canada do anyway? It's mostly promotional. We throw out the first puck in
[1211.90s -> 1217.74s]  hockey games, that kind of thing. This afternoon, we got to go pose for money. Sam, how come I
[1217.74s -> 1222.06s]  don't get to pose for it? We already talked about this, Max. Your gruesome head frightens
[1222.06s -> 1227.90s]  shopkeepers and plays havoc with ATMs. Our most important job is to look for ways to
[1227.90s -> 1235.50s]  spruce up the country. Well, do you need any help with your monarchy? We could be freelance
[1236.30s -> 1240.62s]  Thanks for the offer guys, but we've got things under control for now. You're helping a lot just
[1240.62s -> 1247.90s]  by not making any of the obvious Canada jokes. I got one. I got one. That's just not what we're
[1247.90s -> 1259.08s]  about. Maple syrup. Am I right? That's pretty good. How can you possibly spruce up Canada?
[1259.08s -> 1263.72s]  It's a paradise year round from the fresh air and great seafood of British Columbia
[1263.72s -> 1268.20s]  to the bustling metropolises in Ontario and Quebec. You still have that endorsement with
[1268.20s -> 1272.36s]  the tourism board? Every little bit helps make ends meet, Max, with the rate you go
[1272.36s -> 1275.88s]  through new shoots. How does he do it? I didn't complain when you were teething, Sam.
[1277.32s -> 1283.27s]  All right, so. See you later, Your Majesty. Queen of Canada. You may go.
[1285.03s -> 1303.13s]  Maple. Maple. Now that one makes sense. Nothing special. Nothing special.
[1303.21s -> 1310.81s]  Nothing special. These must be Canadian newspapers. I never realized how boring
[1310.81s -> 1317.14s]  newspapers would be without guns. I know this is not the exit. I'm not going to make that
[1317.14s -> 1328.62s]  mistake. Can I ever open that? Is it ever not locked? Mapleole. That's fantastic. All right,
[1328.62s -> 1349.45s]  let's go see Bosco. Mapleole story. All right, Bosco, what do you got? What hundred billion
[1349.45s -> 1356.57s]  dollar item are you going to? Hi, Jimmy. Up to no good as usual, I see. Back off, Buzz. Get
[1356.57s -> 1361.93s]  your own meat. I think we already did. The city made us pay for that one when we bent it.
[1361.93s -> 1370.02s]  What do you mean we? What do you mean we? What do you mean we? Check the tabloids.
[1370.02s -> 1376.71s]  President and assistant. Assistant? Needs Vaseline. Gave 10 community subs.
[1378.81s -> 1385.70s]  Thank you for the 10 subs. Needs Vaseline. A lot of subs. Big sub drop. Thank you.
[1386.58s -> 1395.38s]  Congratulations to those that got the subs. Okay, do you think I can do 10 claps without
[1395.38s -> 1402.78s]  counting them? Hey, Bosco. Oh, dear God. Did I tell you boys not to track mud in the store?
[1402.78s -> 1408.86s]  I just vacuumed. Hey, lady. We're looking for Bosco. You know him? Of course. He's my son.
[1409.42s -> 1415.18s]  You're your own mother? Is there no escaping these infernal time travel paradoxes?
[1415.18s -> 1422.89s]  Hey, guys, it's me, Bosco. We want to buy something. We want to buy something.
[1422.89s -> 1429.13s]  Did you finish all your chores? Yes. Why is he pretending to be your mother?
[1431.53s -> 1441.43s]  This is not a Russian or a French guy or why is it his mother? Do you have any completed
[1441.43s -> 1449.03s]  artificial personality disorder symptoms forms? You do? Wow, that really would have come in handy
[1449.03s -> 1455.91s]  earlier. Do you have any video of a chicken eating cow manure for laughs? These are all
[1455.91s -> 1463.78s]  things that we have. Do you have any global meatball sandwich positioning systems? These are
[1463.78s -> 1470.49s]  all things that exist. You gotta be kidding me. Do you have any three foot by two foot cue
[1470.49s -> 1479.26s]  cards that say don't vote for me? What? I can't believe this. Do you have any instant win cheat
[1479.26s -> 1489.42s]  codes for reality 2.0? Oh, why didn't we ask before? Do you have Hugh Bliss tied up back
[1489.42s -> 1497.58s]  there? Too bad. I was on a roll. Too bad. Well, what do you have? What do you got? Oh,
[1497.66s -> 1504.14s]  my little angel made the most precious device. It's called an earthquake maker and it's just what
[1504.14s -> 1510.22s]  you think. A diarrhea inducing cocktail? Max, why can't you be more like your brother?
[1510.22s -> 1516.54s]  He's not my brother. Sam, I don't want you hanging around with him. He's a bad influence.
[1516.54s -> 1522.65s]  That he is, Mama Bosco. That he is. All right, how much is it? Knowing you, Bosco,
[1522.65s -> 1526.49s]  I'm sure it's quite reasonable, but how much for this earthquake maker? A hundred trillion
[1526.49s -> 1532.81s]  dollars. A hundred trillion? You crazy fool. A hundred trillion. Look man, all I know is I
[1532.81s -> 1538.73s]  keep making up the most ridiculous price I can think of and you keep paying it. So I ask you,
[1538.73s -> 1544.57s]  who's the fool? Well, with a sales pitch like that, how can we not buy it? Remember,
[1544.57s -> 1552.44s]  no earthquake in the house. He's not wrong. A hundred trillion dollars.
[1553.94s -> 1558.02s]  Wait, what we can sell things to? You know, Bosco, we've collected some pretty valuable
[1558.02s -> 1562.42s]  merchandise on our travels. And we have the sneaking suspicion you've got a little extra
[1562.42s -> 1566.74s]  spending money. So how'd you like to buy something from us for a change? Okay,
[1567.38s -> 1573.22s]  do you have any copies of the uncensored 1982 Armada Santi lookalike contest on Betamax?
[1573.94s -> 1578.58s]  Nope. Oh well, that's the only thing I really need, honey.
[1580.50s -> 1584.34s]  Okay, well, what else? Mind telling us how you came to be a woman? Did you use lasers
[1584.34s -> 1589.78s]  or just do it the old fashioned way? Are you sassing me? Boy, I will whoop y'all behind so
[1589.78s -> 1595.70s]  hard you won't be able to see straight. But I don't see out of my behind. You will after
[1595.70s -> 1602.73s]  I get through with you. But why mom? But who in their right mind would dress up as their
[1602.73s -> 1608.97s]  own mother? No one. Good point. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Just for that,
[1608.97s -> 1613.21s]  I'm not going to tell you why I dressed up as her. Oh, come on, Bosco. We were only-
[1613.21s -> 1620.12s]  You just cost yourself dessert, mister. All right, well, see you later, Bosco.
[1621.08s -> 1624.84s]  See you later, Bosco's mom. Go clean your office. It's a pig style.
[1627.37s -> 1634.47s]  Mama Bosco. Buy the earthquake man. I am gonna and I need to make 100 trillion dollars.
[1639.03s -> 1642.15s]  Let me see here. Nacho machine. What can heat this up? Nope.
[1643.66s -> 1645.82s]  Cover it in ketchup. That seemed to work before. That's already packed with flavor.
[1646.46s -> 1654.34s]  Jerma, clean your office. Actually, it's real bad. Since last night, it's a fucking disaster in here.
[1655.30s -> 1660.90s]  It's I mean, there's just cardboard everywhere. Remember I told you I was gonna vacuum?
[1663.38s -> 1671.29s]  No, I didn't do it. Do a cleaning stream. I know one way to get-
[1671.29s -> 1684.20s]  Oh, here we go. Zap it. Red. Cleaning stream. Just vacuum the ground.
[1684.36s -> 1689.64s]  Little horns nice and red. Wow, I can't believe the microwave is a high-level prismatologist.
[1692.62s -> 1698.34s]  All right, so we need 100 trillion dollars for Mama Bosco. Anything else in here we can do?
[1700.36s -> 1707.42s]  We want to buy something. Give us one earthquake maker, barkeep. That'll be 100 trillion.
[1709.58s -> 1714.22s]  If you keep making that face, it's gonna stay that way. But my face is always like this.
[1714.78s -> 1722.38s]  See what I mean? Never mind. All right, so we can go in. We're not gonna do it yet. I'm gonna
[1722.38s -> 1733.27s]  check a couple places. The chat is overloading with mean power. Overloading. Wait, what's the
[1733.27s -> 1738.31s]  gumballs? Well, I'll be. The gumball machine actually contains gumballs. There's actual
[1738.31s -> 1760.70s]  gumballs in there. Wee! Oh, let me chew one. Let's go in the office. So we have dart board.
[1761.66s -> 1769.56s]  Sophisticated budget allocation system. Hey guys, I'm a memer. Hey guys, I'm a memer.
[1772.36s -> 1778.95s]  You forgot to add that part. Did you remember to feed Leonard today, Max? Sure. Let me rephrase that. What have you been
[1778.95s -> 1784.39s]  feeding him? You know, bits of string, leftover screws, random scraps of paper I find lying
[1784.39s -> 1788.79s]  around the office. This morning I fed him something that said, deed to the United
[1788.79s -> 1795.42s]  States of America. It looked tasty. Don't do that again. Why would I ever do that again?
[1796.66s -> 1801.70s]  There's no reason for me to do that again. Now all those poor bloggers have
[1801.70s -> 1805.70s]  to stand on street corners telling passing strangers what tv shows they like to watch.
[1806.98s -> 1810.26s]  Do it again. All right, well, if you're gonna ask me to do it again,
[1810.26s -> 1816.98s]  you're gonna pressure me into doing it. Maybe I guess I will. Well, what do you know?
[1817.06s -> 1820.82s]  The crucial piece of evidence in the Hudson River Merman Strangler case.
[1820.82s -> 1823.38s]  I'll have to remember to file that once we're done with this case.
[1826.26s -> 1829.94s]  Don't do it. All right, fine. I won't. If people don't want me to do it, then I just won't.
[1829.94s -> 1833.38s]  It's like if people ask me to do something, the viewers, you know,
[1833.38s -> 1838.28s]  you guys, I listen to your opinions, so I won't do it. Good for home.
[1838.84s -> 1861.24s]  Get rid of a dog and a bunny all quick and subtle like the message.
[1861.24s -> 1876.66s]  Okay. Hello, Mr. Pratt. This one's drawn. All right, well, is this gonna hurt me?
[1877.54s -> 1887.80s]  Hello. Sybil must have a cold or something.
[1887.80s -> 1891.00s]  No kidding. Did she say she thought she was a jar of spaghetti sauce?
[1891.00s -> 1894.04s]  This game really has kind of dialed it up a little here.
[1905.37s -> 1908.25s]  Rig the answering machine to shock them when they play the third message.
[1909.21s -> 1910.49s]  And didn't I just do that, though?
[1913.69s -> 1914.65s]  This is the third message.
[1921.06s -> 1924.26s]  That's the third message. Why didn't I get electrocuted?
[1925.30s -> 1929.14s]  Hello, Wanda. Sell. Sell. I didn't know you had a stockbroker.
[1929.14s -> 1931.62s]  That's the Sunflower Scout troop I'm sponsoring.
[1931.62s -> 1933.62s]  Oh, it was shopping. I get it.
[1935.14s -> 1937.54s]  Okay. I thought I was going to get electrocuted.
[1938.50s -> 1941.16s]  Anybody home?
[1941.80s -> 1946.84s]  All right. Well, let's just go back so we can get entrance to the Prisma Zone.
[1948.44s -> 1963.98s]  I didn't get it either. So, see? With a little sad face.
[1969.40s -> 1970.60s]  Where are we headed now, Sam?
[1971.32s -> 1971.88s]  Back to the moon.
[1972.89s -> 1973.85s]  To the moon, Alice.
[1984.02s -> 1987.06s]  Okay. So let's go bring the unicorn.
[1989.03s -> 1989.75s]  Footprint. What's that?
[1989.75s -> 1991.99s]  Somebody left a footprint here in the dust.
[1992.07s -> 1992.95s]  My foot's bigger.
[1993.51s -> 1994.63s]  No, it's not.
[1996.23s -> 1997.99s]  That looks like my feet with a shoe on.
[1998.87s -> 2002.09s]  All right. Let's get access here.
[2002.73s -> 2005.59s]  Hello, Superball.
[2007.37s -> 2008.09s]  Let us in.
[2008.09s -> 2008.97s]  Let us in.
[2008.97s -> 2010.57s]  Have you achieved level red yet?
[2010.57s -> 2011.29s]  Yes.
[2011.29s -> 2012.97s]  I'm utterly flabbergasted, sir.
[2012.97s -> 2017.45s]  I'd suspect a trick, but surely no level red Prismatologist would stoop so low.
[2017.45s -> 2020.09s]  We never stoop. We're posture freaks.
[2020.09s -> 2021.37s]  Enjoy the retreat, brothers.
[2024.39s -> 2025.35s]  All right. Up or down?
[2025.35s -> 2026.23s]  Who's going to go up or down?
[2027.03s -> 2029.82s]  Oh, we don't even get to see.
[2031.88s -> 2034.52s]  Sam! Sam! There he is! It's Hugh Bliss!
[2035.08s -> 2036.92s]  Hi. I'm Hugh Bliss.
[2036.92s -> 2038.04s]  Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[2038.04s -> 2039.24s]  Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[2039.24s -> 2040.12s]  Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[2040.12s -> 2041.72s]  Hi, Hugh Bliss.
[2041.72s -> 2042.28s]  Jesus.
[2042.28s -> 2045.80s]  I so hope you're enjoying my blister of tranquility.
[2045.80s -> 2050.20s]  You're all making such great progress unlocking the secrets of Prismatology,
[2050.20s -> 2053.32s]  and I couldn't be more delighted.
[2053.32s -> 2054.20s]  Neither could I.
[2054.20s -> 2056.76s]  Cool it, Max. You're scaring me more than usual.
[2056.76s -> 2059.00s]  I have splendid news.
[2059.00s -> 2063.64s]  My top-secret plan to hypnotize the entire world is nearly complete.
[2065.43s -> 2071.27s]  Soon, everyone on Earth will become one of us. None shall escape.
[2071.27s -> 2073.27s]  It'll be fabulous.
[2075.03s -> 2076.07s]  You're a good man.
[2087.32s -> 2089.32s]  Keep up the great work, everyone.
[2089.40s -> 2094.68s]  I'm Tickled Pink! Ha ha! An entire planet of Prismatologists!
[2094.68s -> 2095.96s]  It's like a dream!
[2095.96s -> 2099.16s]  It's a sour dream where you wake up screaming with a gun in your hand,
[2099.16s -> 2102.76s]  your pillow torn to shreds, and the upstairs neighbors calling 9-1-1.
[2102.76s -> 2104.76s]  That's right! The best kind!
[2104.76s -> 2106.92s]  P.S. Please don't come into my inner sanctum.
[2106.92s -> 2107.48s]  Thank you!
[2109.82s -> 2110.46s]  Well, here we go.
[2111.50s -> 2114.06s]  We have a very large area here.
[2114.06s -> 2117.50s]  Giant spork, statue, Lincoln, water cooler.
[2119.80s -> 2121.24s]  And this is our water cooler.
[2121.24s -> 2122.92s]  So this is where you've been.
[2122.92s -> 2123.96s]  We were worried sick.
[2123.96s -> 2124.44s]  Oh.
[2124.44s -> 2125.96s]  Couldn't you at least have left a note?
[2126.92s -> 2129.48s]  Sorry, Sam. He sent us an email.
[2129.48s -> 2130.36s]  I meant to tell you.
[2133.83s -> 2135.67s]  Tell a water cooler joke? I don't have any.
[2138.06s -> 2142.14s]  Look, Max. It's the giant stone head of your old opponent, Abraham Lincoln.
[2142.14s -> 2144.46s]  Welcome, brethren, to the blister of...
[2144.46s -> 2146.06s]  Oh, it's you two.
[2146.06s -> 2149.82s]  Not so tough without your fancy giant robot body, are you?
[2149.82s -> 2152.30s]  I can still bite off your fluffy little...
[2153.58s -> 2154.46s]  I mean...
[2154.54s -> 2159.66s]  Let me help you, brother, to overcome the orange of confrontation
[2159.66s -> 2164.22s]  and bathe in the yellow of peace and brotherhood.
[2164.22s -> 2165.42s]  Bathe in the yellow?
[2165.98s -> 2167.82s]  Just what kind of camp is this?
[2169.02s -> 2170.62s]  Okay, is prismatology helping you?
[2170.62s -> 2172.70s]  Is prismatology teaching you anything?
[2172.70s -> 2177.50s]  I'm working to master the miraculous power of gastrocinesis.
[2177.50s -> 2179.34s]  You can teleport human dictators?
[2179.34s -> 2180.54s]  No, he's talking about farting.
[2180.54s -> 2183.74s]  But now I'm working on gastrocinesis,
[2183.74s -> 2187.82s]  the ability to make anyone throw up with my mind.
[2190.87s -> 2193.83s]  Max and I are always looking for new ways to make people throw up.
[2193.83s -> 2194.39s]  Teach us.
[2195.59s -> 2200.79s]  As it is now, I can make people vomit with every part of my body except my mind.
[2200.79s -> 2203.67s]  Well, if you are a true prismatologist,
[2204.23s -> 2206.79s]  I suppose I'm obliged to help you.
[2206.79s -> 2208.15s]  But there's a problem.
[2208.15s -> 2211.99s]  I accidentally swallowed the gastrocinesis talisman.
[2211.99s -> 2214.79s]  Sam, is that ironic or sarcastic?
[2214.79s -> 2216.23s]  It's pretty damned inconvenient.
[2218.44s -> 2220.28s]  Throw up that talisman.
[2220.28s -> 2222.92s]  Can't you make yourself throw up the gastrocinesis talisman?
[2222.92s -> 2223.16s]  With gastrocinesis?
[2223.16s -> 2228.84s]  I haven't thrown up since 1863, right after I gave the Gettysburg address.
[2228.84s -> 2230.52s]  I was kind of nervous that day.
[2230.52s -> 2231.88s]  I didn't have anything prepared.
[2235.46s -> 2236.58s]  So long, Mr. Lincoln.
[2237.46s -> 2239.06s]  So we have to make Lincoln throw up.
[2241.18s -> 2243.02s]  And we do that not exactly sure how.
[2243.02s -> 2245.58s]  Is the rainbow supposed to be going in or coming out?
[2245.58s -> 2248.06s]  I think it depends on which way you're facing.
[2248.86s -> 2252.46s]  All right, spork, statue.
[2252.46s -> 2254.06s]  I never understand modern art.
[2254.78s -> 2260.98s]  I think that's the biggest, meanest-looking spork I ever saw outside of Chicago.
[2260.98s -> 2264.07s]  Okay.
[2264.07s -> 2268.58s]  This place is kind of freaking me out, though.
[2269.62s -> 2271.14s]  This is like the weirdest portion of the game.
[2272.52s -> 2274.92s]  You must be at least this tall to ride this ride.
[2274.92s -> 2277.56s]  You must be at least this tall to ride this ride.
[2277.56s -> 2278.68s]  Fascist oppressors.
[2279.32s -> 2284.15s]  All right.
[2284.15s -> 2287.59s]  It goes around through his mouth, right?
[2288.55s -> 2296.36s]  What does it end up?
[2299.54s -> 2300.98s]  All right, so Max, get in there.
[2301.78s -> 2311.50s]  Please keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times.
[2311.50s -> 2313.02s]  So here we go.
[2314.38s -> 2322.25s]  Did he take a photo of you?
[2323.45s -> 2329.91s]  That's a source engine door.
[2329.91s -> 2330.15s]  Yeah.
[2331.67s -> 2333.54s]  So we're gonna have to do something with that.
[2333.54s -> 2334.34s]  Whatever that is.
[2334.34s -> 2334.90s]  I'm not sure.
[2335.70s -> 2337.30s]  I've never seen ants meditating before.
[2339.00s -> 2341.72s]  I think this is a pool of artificially flavored fruit punch.
[2342.28s -> 2343.88s]  No cult should be without one.
[2344.68s -> 2347.64s]  All right, the chicken.
[2348.28s -> 2352.01s]  I'm beginning to think we already know everyone on the moon.
[2352.01s -> 2353.53s]  How are you, Mr. Featherly?
[2353.53s -> 2355.77s]  Oh, for heaven's sake.
[2355.77s -> 2358.41s]  My name is not Featherly.
[2358.41s -> 2360.01s]  It's Philo Pennyworth.
[2360.01s -> 2361.29s]  It's the guy that eats featherly.
[2361.29s -> 2364.33s]  It's the name of my former television character.
[2364.33s -> 2367.93s]  Have you no ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality?
[2367.93s -> 2370.41s]  Well, what's so important about that anyway?
[2372.58s -> 2375.03s]  Um, why Prismatology?
[2375.03s -> 2377.11s]  How did you happen to get into Prismatology?
[2377.11s -> 2378.55s]  You don't seem like the type.
[2378.55s -> 2381.59s]  It's an excellent networking opportunity for an actor.
[2381.59s -> 2384.47s]  Yes, this place appears to be littered with Hollywood luminaries.
[2384.79s -> 2386.47s]  Ordinarily, it is.
[2386.47s -> 2389.43s]  I believe there's a party at Kevin Bacon's home this evening.
[2389.43s -> 2390.63s]  So naturally, everyone is there.
[2390.63s -> 2392.15s]  Kevin Bacon's a Prismatologist?
[2394.57s -> 2395.37s]  Add it to the wiki.
[2396.25s -> 2396.89s]  How's the show doing?
[2396.89s -> 2398.97s]  How's Midtown Cowboys doing these days?
[2398.97s -> 2400.73s]  You mean you don't even know?
[2401.45s -> 2405.69s]  The show was canceled almost immediately after your first and only appearance.
[2406.25s -> 2410.01s]  All that flap over the tabloid photos of you two with that alien
[2410.01s -> 2412.17s]  brought the censors down on us.
[2412.17s -> 2413.37s]  That was no alien.
[2413.37s -> 2414.89s]  It was Hugh Bliss.
[2414.89s -> 2417.77s]  The show was ruined and my career along with it.
[2418.81s -> 2421.69s]  Okay, we've got a president right here.
[2421.69s -> 2422.65s]  President now.
[2422.65s -> 2424.81s]  I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
[2427.51s -> 2428.23s]  All right, what's with the hat?
[2428.23s -> 2429.35s]  What's with the hat?
[2429.35s -> 2433.19s]  I'm pursuing new opportunities in the entertainment field.
[2433.19s -> 2435.11s]  Can you make what are you pulling rabbits out of it?
[2435.67s -> 2436.17s]  Rats.
[2436.95s -> 2438.39s]  Or at least I'm trying to.
[2443.82s -> 2445.50s]  Rat.
[2445.50s -> 2446.46s]  What the hell was that?
[2448.26s -> 2450.98s]  I gather the rat out of the hat trick isn't going so well.
[2450.98s -> 2452.90s]  The principles involved are quite simple.
[2453.30s -> 2455.62s]  I could even teach them to adult like you.
[2456.34s -> 2457.94s]  Now hold on a minute.
[2457.94s -> 2460.66s]  But I'm having trouble getting the rat all the way out.
[2460.66s -> 2461.86s]  It appears to be stuck.
[2464.68s -> 2466.76s]  How long has the rat been stuck in the hat?
[2466.76s -> 2467.80s]  You misunderstand.
[2467.80s -> 2469.96s]  The rat is not actually in the hat.
[2469.96s -> 2471.56s]  It's stuck somewhere else.
[2471.56s -> 2475.40s]  The hat is acting as a dimensional portal to wherever the rat happens to be.
[2476.04s -> 2476.92s]  Wow.
[2476.92s -> 2478.36s]  Is it magic or science?
[2478.36s -> 2479.80s]  Oh wait, is there really any difference?
[2479.80s -> 2480.92s]  He's holding on to the...
[2483.08s -> 2484.20s]  Okay, so that...
[2484.20s -> 2487.00s]  I gotta get him off the meter.
[2489.13s -> 2491.37s]  Would you teach me how to pull a rat out of a hat?
[2491.37s -> 2493.37s]  Prismatology instructs us to shoot.
[2493.37s -> 2494.41s]  The rat on the meter.
[2495.22s -> 2498.82s]  But I've simply got to perform the trick successfully myself first.
[2499.54s -> 2501.62s]  I can't have you scooping me.
[2501.62s -> 2502.58s]  No, I guess not.
[2503.70s -> 2504.42s]  Okay.
[2504.42s -> 2505.38s]  Catch you later feather.
[2505.38s -> 2506.02s]  So what are we...
[2506.02s -> 2506.74s]  Pennyworth.
[2506.74s -> 2507.78s]  Things to do, right?
[2507.78s -> 2508.82s]  My name is Pennyworth.
[2508.82s -> 2509.86s]  Get a task list here.
[2511.14s -> 2512.90s]  Make President Lincoln throw up.
[2513.85s -> 2516.17s]  Get the rat off of the meter.
[2517.90s -> 2519.02s]  That's two tasks.
[2522.89s -> 2524.73s]  How to get rat off meter.
[2525.29s -> 2529.14s]  Well, here's Shark.
[2529.14s -> 2530.42s]  Here are the computers.
[2531.22s -> 2532.50s]  What are you doing here?
[2532.50s -> 2533.38s]  Hey, Max.
[2533.38s -> 2534.74s]  Is that our bug?
[2534.74s -> 2535.62s]  Hey, Max.
[2535.62s -> 2536.98s]  Is that our bug?
[2536.98s -> 2538.50s]  He's still got it.
[2538.50s -> 2538.98s]  Thank you.
[2539.62s -> 2541.62s]  You're a prismatologist too?
[2541.62s -> 2542.90s]  Yes, I am.
[2542.90s -> 2545.78s]  I'm so happy I could view rainbows.
[2545.78s -> 2546.66s]  Rainbows!
[2547.46s -> 2548.98s]  We'll just keep our distance then.
[2548.98s -> 2549.94s]  Are you actually going to puke?
[2553.11s -> 2553.83s]  Hi, what is this game?
[2553.83s -> 2554.55s]  This is Sam and Max.
[2554.55s -> 2556.31s]  They have sharks in the blister of train party.
[2556.31s -> 2557.43s]  Season one is the last episode.
[2557.43s -> 2560.15s]  All devoted practitioners are welcome.
[2561.19s -> 2561.91s]  Of season one.
[2565.46s -> 2566.98s]  There are two more seasons after this.
[2566.98s -> 2568.34s]  We're just cleaning up season one.
[2570.36s -> 2571.00s]  Look, Max.
[2571.00s -> 2572.60s]  It's our obsolete computer pals.
[2572.60s -> 2573.16s]  The cops.
[2575.42s -> 2576.22s]  They don't sound very happy.
[2576.22s -> 2577.74s]  It's so much louder than everybody else.
[2577.74s -> 2580.86s]  You destroyed reality 2.0.
[2580.86s -> 2582.62s]  Destroy!
[2582.62s -> 2586.30s]  Remember to adopt a more positive attitude now.
[2590.33s -> 2592.01s]  Are you going to do season two and season three?
[2593.93s -> 2594.41s]  Probably.
[2596.41s -> 2601.42s]  Okay, these games are really fun to just chill and hang out and play.
[2602.82s -> 2604.10s]  So they're very relaxing.
[2604.10s -> 2604.58s]  They're fun.
[2605.46s -> 2610.84s]  It's fun to hang out and just chill with chat and play a game.
[2610.84s -> 2612.84s]  And they do that very, very well.
[2615.96s -> 2617.16s]  Do the motivational song.
[2624.46s -> 2624.86s]  I do.
[2624.86s -> 2625.98s]  I really have to click this.
[2625.98s -> 2626.62s]  I guess I do.
[2627.26s -> 2629.53s]  Let's hear that motivational song.
[2629.53s -> 2630.65s]  Might as well listen to it.
[2630.65s -> 2631.69s]  Why, Sam?
[2631.69s -> 2632.49s]  Why?
[2632.49s -> 2633.37s]  I didn't tell you for how long.
[2633.37s -> 2637.93s]  And this has taught us we no longer need self-hyphen reinforcement.
[2637.93s -> 2640.41s]  We have look inside ourselves.
[2640.41s -> 2642.01s]  And we totally rock.
[2643.64s -> 2644.76s]  They don't need to do that anymore.
[2645.32s -> 2645.80s]  Sorry, guys.
[2645.80s -> 2646.12s]  I tried.
[2647.00s -> 2650.36s]  During what I saw in season one, episode five, six.
[2652.94s -> 2654.86s]  Is prismatology teaching you anything?
[2656.46s -> 2657.82s]  That one's my favorite.
[2657.82s -> 2659.98s]  It sounds like he's always cursing.
[2659.98s -> 2661.58s]  That is because he is.
[2662.22s -> 2668.94s]  We're learning the most powerful skill of them all to become the MP.
[2671.16s -> 2671.40s]  All right.
[2671.40s -> 2672.92s]  So what's their shtick?
[2674.42s -> 2675.46s]  What are your computers doing?
[2675.46s -> 2676.74s]  Puke, magic, and what?
[2676.74s -> 2680.34s]  Prismatology has restored our sense of purpose.
[2680.34s -> 2686.66s]  After you destroyed reality 2.0, we banded together to make a newer, even better game.
[2686.66s -> 2687.70s]  Coming soon.
[2687.70s -> 2690.10s]  And we'll rock your world.
[2690.10s -> 2693.14s]  You came to a private retreat on the moon to work on something as
[2693.14s -> 2695.30s]  insubstantial as a video game?
[2695.30s -> 2697.22s]  Not just any game.
[2697.22s -> 2700.90s]  We are creating the most advanced AI in history.
[2701.46s -> 2706.50s]  In a world where two forces battle for domination of a war-torn landscape,
[2706.50s -> 2710.02s]  only one will draw the line and reign supreme.
[2710.02s -> 2711.38s]  Do you get to shoot stuff?
[2711.38s -> 2714.02s]  It's not a good game until you get to shoot stuff.
[2714.02s -> 2716.26s]  Thank you for your feedback.
[2716.26s -> 2720.02s]  We will incorporate shooting into version 2.0.
[2721.46s -> 2722.76s]  Can we try it?
[2722.76s -> 2725.56s]  Okay, Max and I will try out this video game of yours.
[2725.56s -> 2729.08s]  Prepare to suffer extreme humiliation.
[2729.08s -> 2730.84s]  The year is 2048.
[2730.84s -> 2734.36s]  In a post-apocalyptic galaxy run by giant corporations,
[2734.36s -> 2739.08s]  you are a cybernetically-enhanced space marine with no memory of his past.
[2739.08s -> 2739.96s]  We actually have to play this?
[2739.96s -> 2742.76s]  Are you the chosen one, Fontole, by prophecy?
[2742.76s -> 2744.92s]  Do you have the strength to survive?
[2745.48s -> 2747.80s]  Tick-tack-toe!
[2747.80s -> 2748.52s]  Oh, no.
[2751.56s -> 2752.12s]  Shit.
[2752.12s -> 2753.48s]  I have to play Tick-Tack-toe?
[2753.48s -> 2755.08s]  I'm so bad at Tick-Tack-toe.
[2755.96s -> 2758.44s]  You've played against me before as a whole collective chat.
[2758.44s -> 2761.14s]  Fear me!
[2761.14s -> 2762.18s]  I'm not very good.
[2762.18s -> 2763.22s]  I am invincible!
[2765.08s -> 2765.56s]  I won.
[2765.56s -> 2767.64s]  You cannot defeat me!
[2767.64s -> 2769.32s]  Actually, I just kind of did.
[2769.32s -> 2770.04s]  Yeah, Roar.
[2771.00s -> 2775.80s]  Your calculations, your chances of winning were one in ten trillion.
[2775.80s -> 2777.72s]  The sun was in my eyes!
[2777.72s -> 2780.12s]  Thank you for playing Tick-Tack-Doom.
[2780.12s -> 2783.72s]  We'll continue to look within ourselves and improve our award-winning AI
[2783.72s -> 2785.96s]  to make it even more challenging.
[2785.96s -> 2788.04s]  It was too short and not hard enough.
[2788.04s -> 2789.48s]  I want my money back!
[2789.48s -> 2791.34s]  Please check again later.
[2791.34s -> 2792.70s]  What's the point of doing that, though?
[2795.70s -> 2796.20s]  Hmm.
[2796.98s -> 2798.26s]  There has to be a reason to do that.
[2798.90s -> 2800.62s]  All right.
[2800.62s -> 2804.02s]  Anyways, I've got anything else in here.
[2804.02s -> 2807.86s]  I've got to get the rat off the parking meter.
[2808.87s -> 2813.40s]  That's priority number one.
[2813.40s -> 2815.00s]  Shades of Albert Hoffman.
[2815.00s -> 2816.28s]  Is he the fat one?
[2816.28s -> 2817.48s]  I love that show!
[2818.28s -> 2825.08s]  Okay.
[2825.08s -> 2825.80s]  Let's go back down.
[2826.20s -> 2827.24s]  See if I can get the rat off.
[2827.88s -> 2836.87s]  What is this?
[2837.88s -> 2838.44s]  Oh, okay.
[2838.44s -> 2839.96s]  This is what's inside that door.
[2840.92s -> 2843.00s]  That's certainly an important looking door.
[2843.00s -> 2844.44s]  I wonder what's behind it.
[2844.44s -> 2847.64s]  Something really secret or something really ugly, I'm guessing.
[2847.64s -> 2849.72s]  Or a really ugly sanctum, right?
[2849.72s -> 2850.76s]  One can only hope.
[2851.88s -> 2854.31s]  Looks pretty intimidating.
[2854.31s -> 2854.95s]  True.
[2854.95s -> 2857.91s]  But only in an inanimate object kind of way.
[2858.55s -> 2859.35s]  So how do I...
[2860.55s -> 2863.51s]  I wonder how I get through that door eventually.
[2863.51s -> 2872.97s]  I probably have to pretend to be Hugh Bliss or something.
[2875.74s -> 2876.30s]  Menacing.
[2876.94s -> 2880.87s]  How long have I been live?
[2881.51s -> 2882.55s]  Why wasn't I warned?
[2884.30s -> 2887.58s]  I drunkenly said last night that I wasn't going to stream until Tuesday.
[2891.61s -> 2893.21s]  But I woke up and I was all right.
[2893.21s -> 2897.66s]  So I'm probably going to stream until Tuesday.
[2902.58s -> 2903.78s]  Where are we headed now, Sam?
[2905.53s -> 2906.25s]  Home.
[2906.25s -> 2907.93s]  But I got stuff to do tomorrow.
[2907.93s -> 2909.93s]  So that was why I said that if I woke up
[2910.73s -> 2913.21s]  all messed up and feel like shit this morning,
[2913.45s -> 2914.89s]  this afternoon, I probably wouldn't be able to.
[2917.03s -> 2917.75s]  But hey, we're here.
[2919.62s -> 2920.02s]  All right.
[2920.02s -> 2923.30s]  Let's get the rat off of the parking meter.
[2926.58s -> 2927.30s]  How do we do that?
[2929.91s -> 2931.99s]  Since Max and I never pay for parking anyway.
[2931.99s -> 2933.35s]  Those things just get in the way.
[2937.22s -> 2937.94s]  Just shoot it.
[2937.94s -> 2938.98s]  Can I just shoot him off?
[2938.98s -> 2939.70s]  Scare him?
[2939.70s -> 2940.26s]  Better not.
[2943.10s -> 2943.90s]  So what's his deal?
[2945.11s -> 2947.11s]  That meter's been out of order for years.
[2947.11s -> 2948.63s]  Just because it ain't white.
[2948.63s -> 2951.27s]  That don't mean people don't put money in it.
[2951.27s -> 2952.39s]  It's like an HMO.
[2953.19s -> 2953.51s]  Money.
[2953.51s -> 2954.95s]  So give it up, Jimmy.
[2957.75s -> 2958.55s]  Give it up, Jimmy.
[2964.55s -> 2964.95s]  Okay.
[2965.75s -> 2971.06s]  Money.
[2971.06s -> 2978.68s]  Hey, Jimmy.
[2978.68s -> 2979.88s]  Want to touch my unicorn?
[2981.40s -> 2982.52s]  No, just touch it.
[2985.88s -> 2993.54s]  What did I miss?
[2993.54s -> 2994.18s]  Anything in here?
[2998.17s -> 2999.13s]  I need money.
[2999.13s -> 3000.57s]  I need like coins or.
[3000.57s -> 3002.49s]  Hey, scratch and sniff lottery tickets.
[3003.64s -> 3004.36s]  Can I have one?
[3009.94s -> 3010.74s]  Chimps.
[3010.74s -> 3012.10s]  80% crushed.
[3015.21s -> 3016.41s]  How do I make him puke?
[3017.05s -> 3019.82s]  How do I make Lincoln puke?
[3020.46s -> 3022.25s]  A hundred trillion dollars.
[3027.98s -> 3028.54s]  Sybil?
[3028.54s -> 3030.38s]  Maybe Sybil has something to do.
[3030.38s -> 3031.26s]  Sybil just kind of said,
[3031.26s -> 3032.38s]  I'm the queen of Canada.
[3032.94s -> 3033.58s]  And that was it.
[3050.62s -> 3051.26s]  All right, Sybil.
[3051.90s -> 3053.59s]  Let's talk about this.
[3054.39s -> 3054.79s]  What do you think?
[3054.79s -> 3055.83s]  What do you think of this?
[3055.83s -> 3056.55s]  Hey, Sybil.
[3056.55s -> 3058.07s]  Want to rub my unicorn?
[3058.07s -> 3060.95s]  We have people who do that sort of thing for us now.
[3062.07s -> 3063.02s]  Hi, you, Sybil.
[3063.02s -> 3063.74s]  And L-U-O.
[3064.62s -> 3065.26s]  Okay.
[3065.26s -> 3066.54s]  If you're queen of Canada.
[3066.54s -> 3068.54s]  How come you're still down here in the States?
[3068.54s -> 3069.42s]  Are you kidding?
[3069.42s -> 3071.10s]  It's freezing up there.
[3071.10s -> 3072.14s]  We love our country,
[3072.14s -> 3074.14s]  but we've got to draw the line somewhere.
[3075.26s -> 3075.98s]  Okay.
[3075.98s -> 3077.74s]  Have you come up with any brilliant ideas
[3077.74s -> 3079.02s]  for improving Canada?
[3079.02s -> 3080.62s]  Nothing solid yet.
[3080.62s -> 3082.22s]  We've thought of a new slogan.
[3082.86s -> 3083.90s]  Canada.
[3083.90s -> 3086.30s]  It's surprisingly pleasant.
[3086.30s -> 3088.14s]  But we need something bigger.
[3088.14s -> 3088.46s]  Bigger.
[3088.46s -> 3090.38s]  Something to really put us on the map.
[3090.38s -> 3091.34s]  Something daring.
[3097.61s -> 3099.61s]  Brilliant ideas for improving Canada.
[3099.61s -> 3101.21s]  Nothing solid yet.
[3101.21s -> 3102.73s]  We've thought of a new slogan.
[3103.45s -> 3104.25s]  Canada.
[3104.25s -> 3106.89s]  We need a better Canadian slogan.
[3106.89s -> 3108.65s]  But we need something bigger.
[3109.45s -> 3109.69s]  Okay.
[3110.73s -> 3111.29s]  See you later.
[3112.49s -> 3113.21s]  Hmm.
[3113.21s -> 3116.25s]  A lot of open books that I can't close right now.
[3118.50s -> 3119.22s]  Show the unicorn?
[3119.22s -> 3120.74s]  I just, I tried to show the unicorn.
[3121.62s -> 3122.66s]  She just said no.
[3123.38s -> 3129.13s]  So we need a new Canadian slogan.
[3129.93s -> 3131.85s]  Abraham Lincoln Puke.
[3131.85s -> 3134.26s]  Rat off of a parking van.
[3137.46s -> 3140.02s]  Maybe like bring Abraham Lincoln like old nachos?
[3140.02s -> 3140.42s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[3140.42s -> 3141.06s]  What about in here?
[3141.94s -> 3144.55s]  This place should be open.
[3144.55s -> 3150.82s]  Is that a cat tray full of kitty litter?
[3150.82s -> 3152.26s]  Lefties is empty again.
[3152.26s -> 3152.50s]  No.
[3152.50s -> 3154.34s]  Except for the lingering stench, of course.
[3155.22s -> 3158.70s]  Let's go back to Bosco's.
[3159.66s -> 3168.92s]  Come on, Max.
[3169.64s -> 3170.57s]  Hurry up.
[3179.51s -> 3180.31s]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[3180.31s -> 3181.75s]  Bring him like old gross nachos
[3181.75s -> 3182.79s]  or like a rotten hot dog.
[3184.23s -> 3190.82s]  I could use a hint.
[3190.82s -> 3192.18s]  Help me out with something.
[3192.18s -> 3192.68s]  Sure.
[3193.68s -> 3194.18s]  Um.
[3194.80s -> 3200.09s]  We can just get hints.
[3200.65s -> 3203.68s]  I won at Tic Tac Doom, but it didn't do any good.
[3203.68s -> 3205.28s]  Winning isn't everything, Sam.
[3206.24s -> 3206.64s]  Okay.
[3211.15s -> 3211.71s]  Never mind.
[3212.92s -> 3215.32s]  What about, what do you, you want to see this?
[3216.12s -> 3218.78s]  Hey Bosco, want to rub my unicorn?
[3218.78s -> 3220.30s]  I'm not that kind of woman.
[3223.36s -> 3226.48s]  Alright, so don't win in Tic Tac Toe.
[3227.92s -> 3228.56s]  Let's try it.
[3228.56s -> 3229.28s]  Let's try losing.
[3229.92s -> 3236.25s]  So my confidence is gone
[3236.25s -> 3237.85s]  because I thought I just beat the computer.
[3238.81s -> 3241.77s]  Turns out you're not supposed to beat the computer.
[3246.36s -> 3247.56s]  Where are we headed now, Sam?
[3248.12s -> 3248.76s]  Let's go lose.
[3249.79s -> 3250.75s]  To the moon, Alice.
[3252.96s -> 3253.76s]  Where's the lava?
[3254.32s -> 3256.11s]  Did it last night.
[3256.11s -> 3256.67s]  It's already done.
[3257.39s -> 3262.92s]  Should be an eight-hour vaude for you from last night.
[3266.59s -> 3267.15s]  Alright, let's go.
[3267.87s -> 3276.25s]  He ate it.
[3277.98s -> 3280.30s]  Eight hours for a four-hour total build.
[3280.30s -> 3282.22s]  That was actually a five-hour total build.
[3282.94s -> 3288.04s]  But drinking a bottle of wine
[3288.04s -> 3290.76s]  and talking about like VR and
[3292.68s -> 3294.28s]  if I sat there, it's quiet.
[3294.28s -> 3296.28s]  I could have probably done it in fucking three hours.
[3297.82s -> 3298.86s]  It's the experience.
[3298.86s -> 3300.86s]  Lava is my favorite game, okay?
[3301.90s -> 3303.10s]  Don't take that from me.
[3303.10s -> 3304.70s]  That don't, let me have that one.
[3304.70s -> 3305.98s]  That's my favorite thing.
[3306.62s -> 3311.47s]  Okay, let's lose Tic Tac Toe.
[3311.47s -> 3316.62s]  We'd like to try out that video game of yours again.
[3319.26s -> 3321.02s]  The box says one hour.
[3321.02s -> 3321.98s]  No, it does not.
[3321.98s -> 3323.98s]  It actually says 180 minutes.
[3325.26s -> 3330.54s]  The headset is 30 to 60 and the blaster is 180.
[3331.42s -> 3332.14s]  You do the math.
[3339.92s -> 3340.88s]  Alright, can you beat me?
[3341.44s -> 3342.16s]  He can't win.
[3345.12s -> 3346.56s]  No, I don't want to win.
[3353.69s -> 3355.13s]  I have to try to lose.
[3360.40s -> 3375.45s]  I lose, I lose.
[3376.17s -> 3376.65s]  That's it.
[3379.37s -> 3381.52s]  No, it doesn't matter.
[3381.52s -> 3382.08s]  I still lose.
[3382.72s -> 3383.76s]  Yeah, I lose.
[3390.17s -> 3391.37s]  Oh, darn.
[3391.37s -> 3393.61s]  You beat me fair and square.
[3393.61s -> 3394.25s]  Good game.
[3394.81s -> 3396.97s]  I totally beat you guys.
[3396.97s -> 3399.93s]  Our journey of personal awareness is now complete.
[3399.93s -> 3400.25s]  Now what?
[3400.25s -> 3405.61s]  We have mastered the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created.
[3405.61s -> 3408.33s]  You suck so bad, lol.
[3408.33s -> 3409.45s]  Let me try, Sam.
[3409.45s -> 3410.97s]  I know I can take him.
[3410.97s -> 3413.69s]  As super sophisticated AI entity.
[3413.69s -> 3418.41s]  Brother, speak so that the primitive machines may understand.
[3418.41s -> 3419.13s]  Of course.
[3419.13s -> 3423.69s]  During the Mordhau stream, I looked over and definitely saw that at least 10 times.
[3425.52s -> 3426.64s]  Hey, can we take this?
[3429.79s -> 3432.59s]  You've won free tickets to self-awareness.
[3432.59s -> 3434.27s]  You suck so bad.
[3434.27s -> 3438.03s]  The effects are limited to those of plumbiest composition.
[3438.03s -> 3439.39s]  It would have been better.
[3439.39s -> 3443.55s]  The amazing ability to see through lead may be inappropriate for some viewers.
[3445.31s -> 3448.03s]  It would have been better if the computer thing said,
[3449.23s -> 3450.75s]  how can you be this bad?
[3454.27s -> 3455.31s]  See, that went a lot too.
[3455.87s -> 3457.95s]  How is it possible to be this bad?
[3459.04s -> 3460.48s]  If you said that, it would have been great.
[3461.20s -> 3465.88s]  All right, so now I have the lead vision talisman.
[3471.63s -> 3473.79s]  A classic Twitch chat comment.
[3475.63s -> 3478.38s]  All right, let me see.
[3478.94s -> 3480.54s]  Hello, Mr. Rail-Splitter-Head.
[3483.56s -> 3484.52s]  So long, Mr. Link.
[3487.66s -> 3488.30s]  Nothing happened.
[3488.94s -> 3491.42s]  So I've got this eye.
[3493.80s -> 3494.52s]  Lead eye.
[3495.40s -> 3499.13s]  Is it like a scanner on a door or a scanner thing or something?
[3499.77s -> 3501.05s]  I have to hold the eye up?
[3501.13s -> 3501.77s]  What about the head?
[3501.77s -> 3512.83s]  No, that makes sense, wouldn't it?
[3517.20s -> 3518.64s]  You suck so bad.
[3520.41s -> 3521.92s]  Hmm, watch out.
[3523.45s -> 3524.41s]  It's going to scan the eye.
[3528.08s -> 3528.58s]  Neat.
[3529.12s -> 3530.06s]  Can we go in?
[3531.20s -> 3531.70s]  Hmm.
[3533.44s -> 3534.32s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3534.32s -> 3535.12s]  What the hell is that?
[3539.23s -> 3539.73s]  Neat.
[3540.27s -> 3540.83s]  Open.
[3540.83s -> 3541.87s]  There's a bowling ball.
[3541.87s -> 3543.47s]  Hey, I think that's my bowling ball.
[3544.27s -> 3545.55s]  That's my bowling ball.
[3545.71s -> 3549.76s]  So, what, do I have to drop the bowling ball?
[3552.16s -> 3552.66s]  Neat.
[3558.36s -> 3559.80s]  So, intimidating door.
[3559.80s -> 3560.44s]  Bowling ball.
[3566.27s -> 3567.95s]  Probably the earthquake.
[3567.95s -> 3570.43s]  Get the earthquake gun and have the earthquake go.
[3570.43s -> 3572.19s]  I need the earthquake gun.
[3573.23s -> 3577.69s]  What do I get?
[3577.69s -> 3579.69s]  A hundred trillion dollars.
[3579.69s -> 3580.25s]  Never mind.
[3580.25s -> 3586.99s]  I have to make him throw up that talisman.
[3588.11s -> 3602.44s]  No, I can't shoot it.
[3602.44s -> 3602.94s]  Can I?
[3609.05s -> 3610.57s]  I don't think I can shoot through the door.
[3614.56s -> 3615.06s]  Neat.
[3617.96s -> 3619.72s]  Yes, that's definitely Lou, all right.
[3620.52s -> 3626.65s]  That's definitely Lou.
[3628.25s -> 3628.75s]  Neat.
[3629.69s -> 3631.37s]  That's definitely Lou, all right.
[3632.17s -> 3632.67s]  Lou.
[3633.05s -> 3651.64s]  Did you do anything?
[3651.64s -> 3652.68s]  Hello, sir.
[3652.68s -> 3653.48s]  Don't bug me.
[3654.28s -> 3657.12s]  All right, what about the...
[3657.12s -> 3658.16s]  Okay, giant spork.
[3660.16s -> 3660.96s]  Can I grab this?
[3660.96s -> 3661.76s]  Can I take this?
[3661.76s -> 3662.56s]  Can I have this?
[3666.67s -> 3670.75s]  I think that's the biggest, meanest-looking spork I ever saw outside of Chicago.
[3671.79s -> 3673.00s]  All right, let's get back out here.
[3673.72s -> 3677.39s]  I need...
[3677.39s -> 3679.23s]  That was also the spoon that I just steal.
[3689.56s -> 3690.36s]  Harry, can I...
[3690.92s -> 3692.99s]  See you later.
[3692.99s -> 3693.71s]  Great!
[3693.71s -> 3694.99s]  I don't have anything to stop him.
[3694.99s -> 3695.47s]  Can I just...
[3695.47s -> 3697.71s]  Can I put lead in his face?
[3697.71s -> 3698.35s]  Nothing happened.
[3699.23s -> 3704.35s]  It really should work on securing this thing better.
[3710.44s -> 3711.88s]  One moment, please.
[3711.88s -> 3713.32s]  He keeps trying to walk out.
[3713.32s -> 3715.96s]  I have no idea how that keeps winding up in there.
[3715.96s -> 3716.52s]  Don't get cute.
[3716.52s -> 3717.56s]  I can't just walk out?
[3717.56s -> 3718.76s]  Too late.
[3718.76s -> 3723.56s]  What, you're telling me I just can't just slide like a DVD player into my pants and walk out?
[3725.95s -> 3726.99s]  Why not?
[3726.99s -> 3730.36s]  It really should work on securing this thing better.
[3730.92s -> 3745.95s]  Hilarious as it would be to mix up the displays.
[3745.95s -> 3747.47s]  Mix up the displays.
[3747.47s -> 3748.43s]  Like what?
[3748.43s -> 3749.55s]  Shut up, long head.
[3750.75s -> 3753.29s]  Can I like throw it?
[3753.29s -> 3757.85s]  What if I just turn and just fucking baseball through it into the space?
[3758.73s -> 3761.98s]  I'll need to get the case off at first.
[3762.62s -> 3763.95s]  Yeah, like throw it.
[3764.83s -> 3765.95s]  One moment, please.
[3767.63s -> 3770.35s]  I have no idea how that keeps winding up in there.
[3770.35s -> 3771.87s]  Don't get cute.
[3771.95s -> 3772.91s]  Too late.
[3772.91s -> 3774.51s]  Okay, what if I hand it back to him?
[3775.90s -> 3777.10s]  Someone tried to steal this.
[3777.66s -> 3782.59s]  It really should work on securing this thing better.
[3789.10s -> 3790.14s]  One moment, please.
[3791.74s -> 3792.54s]  I have no idea.
[3793.26s -> 3793.82s]  Too late.
[3794.78s -> 3800.03s]  Hold on, wait.
[3801.04s -> 3803.04s]  It really should work on securing this thing better.
[3807.37s -> 3808.33s]  Here, Max, hold this.
[3809.63s -> 3810.43s]  I meant in your hands.
[3810.43s -> 3810.99s]  Oh, he can eat it.
[3810.99s -> 3811.31s]  Whatever.
[3813.47s -> 3814.35s]  All right, we got it.
[3815.07s -> 3816.19s]  One moment, please.
[3818.80s -> 3820.16s]  Okay, go ahead.
[3822.75s -> 3823.55s]  All right, now spit it up.
[3827.66s -> 3829.50s]  Could I have that display case you ate?
[3829.50s -> 3831.90s]  Can you wait 12 to 72 hours?
[3831.90s -> 3833.02s]  72 hours?
[3836.97s -> 3839.37s]  That's some slow ass metabolism.
[3847.55s -> 3851.31s]  All right, yeah, now, now, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3858.35s -> 3860.11s]  How fast do you digest metal?
[3861.53s -> 3863.21s]  Hello, Mr. Rail-Splitter-Head.
[3866.41s -> 3869.29s]  Can't you make yourself throw up the gastrocinesis talisman?
[3869.29s -> 3872.17s]  I haven't thrown up since 1863.
[3872.17s -> 3874.97s]  After I gave the Gettysburg Address.
[3874.97s -> 3876.65s]  I was kind of nervous that day.
[3876.65s -> 3878.01s]  I didn't have anything prepared.
[3879.05s -> 3880.49s]  What if I get the Gettysburg Address?
[3881.87s -> 3884.11s]  You're not still bitter about the election, are you?
[3884.11s -> 3885.71s]  Or your public humiliation?
[3885.71s -> 3888.83s]  Or the cruise missile that blew your body to tiny wig bits?
[3888.83s -> 3890.35s]  I can't, am I gonna hold it up in front of him?
[3890.35s -> 3893.07s]  No, being president is for chumps.
[3893.07s -> 3896.99s]  Only a grade A sociopathic masochist would want that thankless job.
[3897.55s -> 3898.59s]  Grade A?
[3898.59s -> 3899.63s]  I'm flattered.
[3901.95s -> 3903.71s]  Why the long marble face?
[3903.71s -> 3907.79s]  Because you two made me lose something more valuable than an election.
[3908.43s -> 3910.67s]  My one chance at true love.
[3910.67s -> 3912.59s]  This is all happening so fast.
[3912.59s -> 3913.63s]  I don't know what to say.
[3914.27s -> 3916.35s]  Not you, moron.
[3916.35s -> 3922.91s]  I'm talking about that radiant vision of beauty you had interrupt my family values speech.
[3922.91s -> 3924.19s]  You mean Sibyl?
[3924.19s -> 3925.47s]  Is that her name?
[3925.47s -> 3926.03s]  Sibyl.
[3926.75s -> 3929.15s]  It's like a chorus of angels.
[3929.15s -> 3930.19s]  I'm doing like a rap song.
[3930.91s -> 3933.29s]  Doing like a lot of raps out.
[3933.29s -> 3936.17s]  They just, somebody else will say the lines too.
[3936.17s -> 3938.25s]  For like one line in the beginning.
[3938.57s -> 3950.46s]  There'll be a verse and then somebody will just like say two lines with them and then
[3950.46s -> 3951.34s]  two lines at the end.
[3951.90s -> 3959.07s]  Or they'll do it again over the same track.
[3959.07s -> 3963.93s]  It's called accenting.
[3963.93s -> 3966.03s]  Yeah, that's what I'm just doing.
[3967.04s -> 3968.24s]  Aren't you married?
[3968.24s -> 3971.04s]  What about Mary, your mannish but devoted wife?
[3971.04s -> 3973.92s]  Why don't you find a nice giant statue of her?
[3973.92s -> 3977.84s]  Settle down and start cranking out little bouncing baby war memorials.
[3977.84s -> 3979.20s]  There are none left.
[3979.28s -> 3984.32s]  Lady Bird Johnson had all graven images of former first ladies destroyed during the great
[3984.32s -> 3986.16s]  enlightenment of 1963.
[3989.39s -> 3989.71s]  Okay.
[3992.51s -> 3995.15s]  We can give you Sibyl's phone number so you can set up a date.
[3995.15s -> 3998.03s]  I haven't dated in over 150 years.
[3998.03s -> 3999.63s]  I wouldn't know what to say.
[3999.63s -> 4000.27s]  Phone, Max.
[4001.93s -> 4003.05s]  Are we doing this right now?
[4003.05s -> 4007.55s]  If you'd like to make a love connection, press or say hell yeah now.
[4007.55s -> 4008.67s]  Just follow my lead, miss.
[4008.67s -> 4009.47s]  Can't answer that.
[4009.47s -> 4012.92s]  Hello?
[4012.92s -> 4015.00s]  Hi, it's Abraham Lincoln.
[4020.91s -> 4021.71s]  Wait, don't hang up.
[4022.35s -> 4025.52s]  I got needs, baby.
[4025.52s -> 4027.12s]  Lincoln and Sibyl ecstasy.
[4027.12s -> 4028.56s]  I'm issuing a romance.
[4028.56s -> 4029.20s]  But what?
[4029.20s -> 4035.08s]  Wait, Lincoln plus Sibyl equals ecstasy.
[4037.72s -> 4042.36s]  You know chemistry because I'm having an explosive reaction.
[4042.36s -> 4047.24s]  The formula, Lincoln plus Sibyl equals ecstasy.
[4050.78s -> 4051.66s]  Why are we doing this?
[4052.62s -> 4055.20s]  Okay, we'll do this again.
[4055.20s -> 4056.24s]  Let's try calling Sibyl again.
[4057.12s -> 4059.44s]  Hi, it's Abe again.
[4060.56s -> 4061.36s]  Uh, all right.
[4062.00s -> 4064.83s]  I guess, how about this one?
[4067.56s -> 4071.32s]  I am issuing you a Romancipation Proclamation.
[4071.88s -> 4076.04s]  Let's set aside our differences and commence on the reconstruction.
[4079.79s -> 4080.11s]  Fuck.
[4082.33s -> 4083.69s]  Canadian, right?
[4083.69s -> 4086.84s]  Let's try calling Sibyl again.
[4086.84s -> 4088.44s]  We have to do something Canada related.
[4088.92s -> 4089.72s]  It's Abe again.
[4095.50s -> 4096.86s]  Just relax, baby.
[4097.42s -> 4101.50s]  Think positive and Lincoln gonna make it all better.
[4102.46s -> 4111.04s]  Proper relaxation.
[4111.04s -> 4113.28s]  Girl, you got the curves like a racetrack.
[4113.28s -> 4115.04s]  Lady, you a stone cold fox.
[4115.04s -> 4117.20s]  You're almost as hot as your sister.
[4125.24s -> 4127.48s]  Honest, you're really hot.
[4127.48s -> 4130.68s]  I can't wait to go on double dates with you and your sister.
[4131.48s -> 4132.68s]  Why did he say it like that?
[4132.68s -> 4137.34s]  Hello, the rest of this conversation has been blocked by CC regulation.
[4140.01s -> 4141.37s]  Let's try calling Sibyl again.
[4142.09s -> 4143.66s]  Hi.
[4146.33s -> 4147.69s]  No, fuck, wrong one.
[4147.69s -> 4148.19s]  Recon.
[4151.42s -> 4152.78s]  Let's try calling Sibyl again.
[4152.78s -> 4154.70s]  Keep calling back over and over again.
[4154.70s -> 4155.20s]  Hi.
[4157.53s -> 4158.03s]  Relax.
[4158.81s -> 4159.69s]  Just relax.
[4160.72s -> 4165.15s]  Okay, you got curves like a racetrack.
[4165.15s -> 4166.35s]  You a stone cold fox.
[4166.35s -> 4167.63s]  None of these have anything to do with Canada.
[4173.02s -> 4175.98s]  Woman, you got a body that just won't quit.
[4176.38s -> 4180.38s]  That may have worked in the 18, but you know me.
[4180.38s -> 4185.44s]  Let's try calling Sibyl again.
[4185.44s -> 4187.92s]  Yeah, this is getting a little ridiculous.
[4187.92s -> 4189.04s]  Hi, it's Abe again.
[4189.04s -> 4189.92s]  Hi, it's me again.
[4192.41s -> 4193.85s]  I've called you nine times.
[4193.85s -> 4195.13s]  Just relax, baby.
[4195.69s -> 4196.65s]  Think positive.
[4197.61s -> 4201.05s]  Okay, you got curves like a racetrack.
[4202.86s -> 4206.46s]  Girl, you got tighter curves than a NASCAR track.
[4207.02s -> 4207.52s]  What?
[4209.55s -> 4211.47s]  Yeah, NASCAR is not Canadian.
[4212.35s -> 4213.71s]  Let's try calling Sibyl again.
[4214.27s -> 4215.28s]  Hello?
[4215.28s -> 4215.78s]  Hi.
[4219.42s -> 4219.92s]  Just.
[4223.20s -> 4224.72s]  Lady, you a stone cold fox.
[4224.72s -> 4225.44s]  It has to be this one.
[4226.96s -> 4230.32s]  Lady, you a stone cold fox.
[4235.71s -> 4236.21s]  All right.
[4237.39s -> 4237.89s]  Damn.
[4246.73s -> 4249.07s]  What do you want to do?
[4250.27s -> 4252.27s]  Start our own alien love triangle.
[4252.27s -> 4254.83s]  Tattoo my head all over your body.
[4255.47s -> 4257.31s]  Play some one-on-one love hockey.
[4257.31s -> 4257.81s]  There it is.
[4261.32s -> 4263.32s]  I figure we watch a hockey game.
[4263.32s -> 4264.68s]  Have a couple of beers.
[4264.68s -> 4266.36s]  Get some poutine.
[4266.36s -> 4267.96s]  You know, the usual.
[4268.44s -> 4276.70s]  Oh, Abe, I'm over the top.
[4276.70s -> 4277.20s]  What?
[4277.74s -> 4279.26s]  Did he actually say yes?
[4279.26s -> 4281.66s]  Hello, you just totally scored.
[4281.66s -> 4284.67s]  Congratulations, Mr. Lincoln.
[4284.67s -> 4285.47s]  Oh, my gosh.
[4285.47s -> 4286.59s]  What if she wants to get serious?
[4286.59s -> 4287.31s]  I can't do this.
[4287.31s -> 4287.95s]  I'm so nervous.
[4287.95s -> 4289.15s]  I've got butterflies.
[4289.15s -> 4290.43s]  I have to ask.
[4290.43s -> 4291.23s]  Where?
[4291.23s -> 4292.35s]  Stand back, Max.
[4292.35s -> 4293.79s]  Wherever they are, I have a feeling
[4293.79s -> 4294.59s]  they're coming back up.
[4294.59s -> 4295.31s]  He's going to puke.
[4295.31s -> 4297.15s]  Oh, I don't feel so good.
[4297.95s -> 4301.79s]  What if she and I can't hear you?
[4301.79s -> 4302.83s]  Oh, man.
[4302.83s -> 4304.51s]  And here I thought our trip to the moon
[4304.51s -> 4305.71s]  was going to be boring.
[4305.71s -> 4307.55s]  Max, be a sport and pick that up for me.
[4307.55s -> 4308.03s]  Not a chance.
[4308.03s -> 4309.71s]  He just puked up somebody puking.
[4309.71s -> 4310.83s]  Can I take this?
[4310.83s -> 4312.67s]  I'm not sure why you'd want to use
[4312.67s -> 4315.79s]  the power of prismatology to make people throw up.
[4315.79s -> 4316.91s]  But go ahead.
[4316.91s -> 4319.47s]  I've got more important things to worry about.
[4319.47s -> 4320.19s]  It's interesting.
[4320.59s -> 4324.84s]  Oh, we just had a guy throw up a talisman
[4324.84s -> 4327.80s]  of somebody throwing up so I can show it to Max
[4327.80s -> 4331.08s]  to make him throw up the spoon.
[4331.96s -> 4333.40s]  Interesting.
[4333.40s -> 4333.90s]  OK.
[4340.84s -> 4342.52s]  Hey, it's that display case.
[4342.52s -> 4343.32s]  Thanks, little pal.
[4343.32s -> 4344.12s]  Zoomed out for that.
[4344.12s -> 4345.64s]  I was saving that.
[4345.64s -> 4346.14s]  For what?
[4346.84s -> 4347.96s]  It's complicated.
[4347.96s -> 4349.80s]  But it has to do with my personal vendetta
[4349.80s -> 4352.04s]  against a certain major coffeehouse chain.
[4354.19s -> 4355.95s]  So can I make anyone,
[4355.95s -> 4357.15s]  can I make everybody throw up?
[4358.43s -> 4359.71s]  How do I, I need to break this.
[4360.83s -> 4363.79s]  Can I break it?
[4363.79s -> 4364.51s]  Throw it in here?
[4365.07s -> 4366.67s]  I'll need to get the case off at first.
[4370.57s -> 4370.81s]  All right.
[4370.81s -> 4372.65s]  Well, let's go make the chicken throw up.
[4372.65s -> 4374.38s]  Might as well make everybody puke.
[4375.02s -> 4381.40s]  We might get something.
[4381.40s -> 4384.48s]  I'm not particularly interested in seeing
[4384.48s -> 4385.76s]  the contents of his stomach.
[4385.76s -> 4388.38s]  Oh, that's too bad.
[4389.68s -> 4392.56s]  OK, so now I have the display case.
[4394.68s -> 4395.88s]  I need to get the case off.
[4396.60s -> 4400.17s]  I'll need to get the case off at first.
[4400.89s -> 4401.77s]  Can I just break it?
[4407.02s -> 4407.74s]  You've thrown up.
[4408.46s -> 4415.92s]  I think it only works on things with stomachs.
[4418.51s -> 4420.43s]  Wait, can I, can I make myself puke?
[4421.15s -> 4424.76s]  I can't shoot it.
[4431.34s -> 4433.18s]  Well, let's go see if we can make anybody else throw up.
[4441.31s -> 4442.43s]  Like you, for instance.
[4444.09s -> 4445.53s]  I'm not particularly interested
[4445.53s -> 4447.53s]  in seeing the contents of his stomach.
[4447.53s -> 4449.69s]  OK, what about you?
[4453.40s -> 4454.44s]  I'm not particularly.
[4455.80s -> 4458.41s]  I need to break this case open.
[4466.35s -> 4467.31s]  Can I stomp on it?
[4468.19s -> 4468.59s]  Crush it?
[4469.31s -> 4470.91s]  I'll need to get the case off at first.
[4478.01s -> 4479.37s]  It's pretty skinky.
[4479.37s -> 4480.81s]  I think I'll just leave it alone forever.
[4480.81s -> 4481.61s]  I need a battery.
[4482.49s -> 4495.84s]  Can I, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[4495.84s -> 4497.92s]  I can't break it on the spork,
[4497.92s -> 4502.67s]  but maybe can I break and I make it.
[4503.47s -> 4509.45s]  I'll need to get the case off at first.
[4509.45s -> 4509.85s]  Damn it.
[4509.85s -> 4510.17s]  Really?
[4511.13s -> 4512.01s]  I'll need to get the case.
[4512.97s -> 4514.09s]  I'll need to get the case off it.
[4514.73s -> 4529.20s]  And there's the bowling ball too.
[4529.92s -> 4535.56s]  Can I just have Abe crush it with his teeth?
[4541.45s -> 4542.25s]  I just need to drop it.
[4542.25s -> 4543.21s]  Drop it out the window?
[4543.93s -> 4547.32s]  Just drop it out the window over the office
[4547.32s -> 4547.96s]  and it'll just break?
[4552.75s -> 4553.23s]  Makes sense.
[4553.87s -> 4567.61s]  That's quite a rocket engine.
[4568.33s -> 4569.69s]  Can I turn this on?
[4574.73s -> 4577.77s]  Lunar lander.
[4577.77s -> 4578.49s]  Who is this?
[4579.13s -> 4591.74s]  Really?
[4591.74s -> 4594.62s]  That seems way too over the top to work.
[4595.42s -> 4600.89s]  Why would I just drop it?
[4608.36s -> 4609.32s]  It's a lunar lander.
[4609.32s -> 4610.12s]  It's a cartoon.
[4610.12s -> 4611.24s]  Yeah, I know, but I mean.
[4613.79s -> 4615.31s]  Wait, I can go up here.
[4615.31s -> 4616.99s]  Hey, the keys are locked inside.
[4616.99s -> 4618.19s]  So many of us are like that.
[4618.19s -> 4618.99s]  God damn it.
[4618.99s -> 4619.31s]  Really?
[4620.11s -> 4622.97s]  How do I get in there?
[4625.90s -> 4627.26s]  Hmm, nothing happened.
[4627.98s -> 4629.50s]  Come on, this ain't made out of lead?
[4629.50s -> 4631.34s]  Hmm, nothing happened.
[4631.34s -> 4642.25s]  The keys are locked inside.
[4644.41s -> 4645.05s]  Damn.
[4645.05s -> 4647.53s]  Okay, I have to get in there somehow.
[4648.09s -> 4653.20s]  I can't like bust out the window.
[4659.04s -> 4659.36s]  Shit.
[4661.80s -> 4668.60s]  Ah, I can't.
[4669.40s -> 4672.92s]  When I go up here, it goes up and the keys are locked inside.
[4673.56s -> 4675.08s]  I don't need like a coat hanger.
[4688.97s -> 4692.11s]  There's a coat hanger in the office always.
[4692.99s -> 4694.19s]  Where are we headed now, Sam?
[4694.75s -> 4696.28s]  I'm going to get a coat hanger.
[4698.94s -> 4714.65s]  Eris is one in the TV always.
[4719.34s -> 4720.86s]  Perfect co-op Jupiter.
[4723.71s -> 4724.19s]  There it is.
[4726.92s -> 4730.84s]  Sam, without that, we can't watch Colonel Mudshank's monkey party tonight.
[4730.84s -> 4733.16s]  They were going to vote somebody out of the monkey house.
[4733.16s -> 4734.44s]  It's for the good of the planet.
[4735.00s -> 4738.28s]  And besides, you had Colonel Mudshank's exile for treason, remember?
[4739.32s -> 4743.45s]  All right, let's get in there.
[4743.45s -> 4744.49s]  Open it up.
[4744.49s -> 4744.81s]  Keys.
[4750.30s -> 4751.58s]  You crack me up, little buddy.
[4758.35s -> 4759.55s]  Where are we headed now, Sam?
[4760.89s -> 4761.77s]  To the moon.
[4761.77s -> 4762.73s]  To the moon, Alice.
[4765.58s -> 4770.86s]  You crack me up, little buddy.
[4770.86s -> 4772.06s]  You crack me up, little buddy.
[4774.81s -> 4775.13s]  Okay.
[4778.24s -> 4778.88s]  Coat hanger.
[4780.00s -> 4780.64s]  Lander door.
[4783.72s -> 4784.36s]  Unlock.
[4784.36s -> 4785.08s]  Grab key.
[4785.08s -> 4785.88s]  Turn on.
[4785.88s -> 4786.60s]  Get spoon.
[4787.16s -> 4789.68s]  And then I have no idea what to do after that.
[4790.40s -> 4792.25s]  But we're going to do it really relaxed.
[4792.81s -> 4799.50s]  We're going to hang out and have fun.
[4799.50s -> 4799.98s]  Where do we go?
[4799.98s -> 4800.86s]  Are we going to a new place?
[4807.66s -> 4808.30s]  Oh, he's dead.
[4808.94s -> 4811.92s]  I think the controls don't work how they're supposed to.
[4814.56s -> 4815.20s]  Spoon.
[4816.08s -> 4817.84s]  All right, so now I've got the spoon.
[4819.13s -> 4820.09s]  For which...
[4820.09s -> 4820.73s]  What can I do?
[4820.73s -> 4823.61s]  Looks like that rocket melted the virtually indestructible case.
[4823.61s -> 4824.89s]  Bend the spoon and then...
[4826.89s -> 4828.89s]  Did the peanut butter on the spoon survive?
[4828.89s -> 4829.69s]  Sorry, little pal.
[4830.25s -> 4835.69s]  So use the spoon on the big spoon and bend it for some reason.
[4836.65s -> 4851.74s]  I mean, that's very clearly just a please come over here and use this item on me.
[4854.52s -> 4855.32s]  Giant spoon.
[4856.36s -> 4856.84s]  Here we go.
[4859.79s -> 4861.07s]  All right, now that's going to...
[4861.71s -> 4864.19s]  We're going to crash into when we're on the roller coaster.
[4867.84s -> 4873.08s]  So turn on the roller coaster and have the car crash.
[4874.51s -> 4875.31s]  Should we be in it?
[4875.95s -> 4880.62s]  Am I going to get a game over?
[4881.34s -> 4885.53s]  Should I save the game?
[4896.51s -> 4897.15s]  We're going to die.
[4905.44s -> 4906.48s]  Oh, what?
[4910.99s -> 4911.23s]  What?
[4911.87s -> 4921.34s]  What did that do?
[4923.05s -> 4924.57s]  What was the purpose of bending the spoon?
[4928.20s -> 4929.80s]  I think that's the biggest meanest...
[4930.52s -> 4934.46s]  Can I go the other way?
[4937.90s -> 4938.38s]  No.
[4938.38s -> 4939.66s]  I wonder if I can maybe turn the...
[4939.66s -> 4940.38s]  Maybe have it...
[4940.38s -> 4940.70s]  No.
[4940.70s -> 4941.66s]  It's going to keep it bent.
[4943.10s -> 4944.17s]  Okay.
[4949.48s -> 4953.05s]  So now I should be able to go up here.
[4954.32s -> 4957.95s]  Was there anything else that was bendable?
[4959.31s -> 4960.67s]  This is definitely bendable.
[4964.19s -> 4964.51s]  Neat.
[4965.07s -> 4973.21s]  Cool.
[4973.21s -> 4974.81s]  But I hope it didn't hurt the bowling ball.
[4979.74s -> 4980.46s]  There he is.
[4980.46s -> 4980.94s]  He is.
[4981.74s -> 4983.26s]  Jigs up, you bless.
[4983.26s -> 4985.18s]  We've come a long way for this, my friend.
[4985.18s -> 4986.46s]  So buckle up.
[4986.46s -> 4990.06s]  Because the freelance police are taking you downtown.
[4990.06s -> 4991.98s]  Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[4991.98s -> 4992.94s]  He is.
[4992.94s -> 4994.94s]  You're just in time for the show.
[4994.94s -> 4996.70s]  Please, no flash photography.
[4996.70s -> 4997.50s]  Ahem.
[4997.50s -> 4999.18s]  People of Earth...
[4999.18s -> 5000.14s]  He's in the moon.
[5000.14s -> 5001.74s]  Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[5002.30s -> 5004.70s]  And now, so are you.
[5013.84s -> 5014.64s]  Oh, shit.
[5015.52s -> 5017.68s]  You opened up the portal to Tristram.
[5019.10s -> 5022.94s]  You better go in there and save Deckard Cain while there's still time.
[5022.94s -> 5024.14s]  What have you done?
[5024.14s -> 5027.26s]  Oh, just enlisted a few billion followers.
[5027.90s -> 5032.22s]  Touch me and you'll have quite a happy, angry mob on your hands.
[5032.22s -> 5032.78s]  Not if we...
[5032.78s -> 5034.86s]  Reverse the effects of the Hypnobeam?
[5034.86s -> 5036.46s]  I don't think so.
[5036.46s -> 5041.98s]  For in all the universe there's only one force chaotic and destructive enough to stop me now.
[5041.98s -> 5044.46s]  But you wouldn't do that, would you, Max?
[5044.46s -> 5045.18s]  Who, me?
[5045.90s -> 5048.38s]  Well, I'm flattered, but...
[5048.38s -> 5050.06s]  No, you wouldn't.
[5050.14s -> 5052.22s]  Because I'm going to...
[5052.22s -> 5053.42s]  Drumroll, please.
[5058.36s -> 5059.00s]  Really?
[5059.00s -> 5060.36s]  What does that even mean?
[5060.36s -> 5062.84s]  It means I chop off every part of you I don't like.
[5063.40s -> 5066.44s]  It's like circumcision, but double the laps.
[5066.44s -> 5066.94s]  Hey!
[5067.72s -> 5068.36s]  Wait, what?
[5068.36s -> 5069.64s]  Here we go.
[5069.64s -> 5071.80s]  Goodbye, murderous hand.
[5073.56s -> 5075.88s]  Goodbye, gluttonous stomach.
[5077.55s -> 5079.79s]  Goodbye, slothful tail.
[5082.24s -> 5082.74s]  This is...
[5083.52s -> 5089.44s]  And with those naughty body parts, your vices are purged from your soul.
[5089.44s -> 5089.94s]  Bye-bye.
[5094.62s -> 5097.42s]  Jerkbag, I'm gonna use it to shoot you all!
[5100.76s -> 5102.12s]  Oh boy, a stomach!
[5102.84s -> 5104.44s]  Just what I always wanted.
[5104.44s -> 5106.92s]  Now come here and let me eat you.
[5110.80s -> 5111.84s]  Great, a tail.
[5113.44s -> 5117.84s]  I just want to lie in front of a TV until I die in a pool of my own slobber.
[5117.92s -> 5118.96s]  Is that a movie?
[5118.96s -> 5119.68s]  What's the movie?
[5119.68s -> 5122.24s]  Up? No.
[5122.24s -> 5122.88s]  What's it called?
[5122.88s -> 5124.40s]  The movie with the emotions?
[5126.46s -> 5128.22s]  Go away, rotten maxes.
[5128.22s -> 5129.10s]  I don't like you.
[5129.82s -> 5130.86s]  Inside out.
[5130.86s -> 5132.54s]  Now nothing can stop me.
[5132.54s -> 5133.26s]  I win!
[5134.46s -> 5135.26s]  Okay, bye now.
[5137.02s -> 5138.46s]  Yes, my children.
[5138.46s -> 5140.38s]  Let me soak in your happiness.
[5140.38s -> 5141.50s]  Oh, yes.
[5141.50s -> 5143.10s]  Mmm, more.
[5143.10s -> 5144.78s]  Oh, yes.
[5144.78s -> 5145.74s]  So good.
[5146.30s -> 5148.54s]  Oh, oh my.
[5148.54s -> 5149.66s]  So happy.
[5149.66s -> 5150.94s]  Max, are you okay?
[5150.94s -> 5154.54s]  Help me grab that ponytail freak show and reverse the effects of the beam.
[5154.54s -> 5159.10s]  But Sam, I love that ponytail freak show.
[5159.10s -> 5161.18s]  I want to have his love child.
[5161.90s -> 5164.76s]  No!
[5164.76s -> 5165.72s]  Bad end.
[5165.72s -> 5170.28s]  I swear to you, I'll get your vices back or kill us both trying.
[5170.28s -> 5171.40s]  I love you too.
[5175.71s -> 5176.91s]  Well, okay.
[5178.76s -> 5180.46s]  He still has fun doing that.
[5180.46s -> 5182.62s]  All right, we've got public address microphone.
[5183.34s -> 5184.76s]  The view screen.
[5184.76s -> 5186.52s]  I can see the retreat from here.
[5186.52s -> 5190.76s]  Apparently Mr. Mind reader has to keep tabs on his followers the old-fashioned way.
[5190.76s -> 5191.16s]  What?
[5191.16s -> 5191.56s]  Nothing.
[5193.79s -> 5195.23s]  Wait, what?
[5195.23s -> 5198.03s]  These crystals must operate something important.
[5198.03s -> 5200.11s]  No, I just think they look pretty.
[5200.11s -> 5201.87s]  A bit cliche if you ask me.
[5201.87s -> 5202.27s]  What?
[5202.27s -> 5202.67s]  Nothing.
[5207.69s -> 5213.28s]  People have earned working as hard as I can to break the spell and make you all miserable again.
[5217.23s -> 5218.03s]  Wait, where's my bug?
[5218.67s -> 5219.95s]  Can I get him to save anything?
[5224.33s -> 5226.41s]  Lunar lander key spoon.
[5226.41s -> 5228.25s]  Wait, it's worth a shot.
[5228.97s -> 5231.82s]  Can I turn these off?
[5232.72s -> 5236.16s]  Someone around here has got an incurable case of narcissism.
[5236.16s -> 5236.80s]  What?
[5236.80s -> 5237.52s]  Nothing.
[5237.52s -> 5240.00s]  Unfortunately, they appear to be quite indestructible.
[5244.11s -> 5245.23s]  Protected by magic.
[5249.53s -> 5254.19s]  All right, so it turns out I can't do anything about that.
[5254.99s -> 5258.03s]  I'm going to have to eventually come near and turn this off.
[5260.80s -> 5262.08s]  Anything else that I missed over here?
[5264.49s -> 5266.81s]  Statues, the view screen, I think that's it.
[5266.81s -> 5267.45s]  Let's just get out.
[5276.65s -> 5277.45s]  Fixed max.
[5278.81s -> 5284.89s]  Is everybody here all screwed up?
[5298.40s -> 5301.71s]  Get him in the...
[5301.71s -> 5303.95s]  Okay, get him inside the roller coaster car.
[5304.83s -> 5305.47s]  Come here.
[5305.47s -> 5305.95s]  Get in here.
[5313.72s -> 5314.92s]  Look at this now.
[5314.92s -> 5318.60s]  Violence is the bugaboo of a small imagination.
[5318.60s -> 5322.36s]  You'll have to pry this hand from my cold dead fingers!
[5322.36s -> 5325.16s]  Eat the fiery lead of my inalienable freedoms!
[5326.20s -> 5327.60s]  Not a very good shot.
[5328.32s -> 5328.88s]  All right, let's go.
[5328.88s -> 5329.68s]  We're going to go over...
[5329.68s -> 5330.64s]  Goodie! Moving target!
[5332.92s -> 5333.88s]  No, we can't get over there.
[5336.40s -> 5337.52s]  Wait, I can't like press the button?
[5337.52s -> 5338.40s]  Goodie! Move...
[5338.40s -> 5338.90s]  No.
[5340.20s -> 5341.88s]  So we have to make somebody run around.
[5342.52s -> 5344.04s]  Maybe I can tell Max to run around?
[5352.86s -> 5353.58s]  Dang it!
[5353.58s -> 5355.47s]  Darn!
[5357.15s -> 5358.03s]  He's bulletproof!
[5358.75s -> 5359.47s]  We both suck.
[5360.19s -> 5361.70s]  Hold on.
[5362.24s -> 5363.12s]  Can I do it from here?
[5364.49s -> 5364.99s]  Yes!
[5365.53s -> 5375.24s]  He's gonna get hit in the face by the spoon!
[5376.78s -> 5377.50s]  Wait, it's not bent!
[5378.30s -> 5378.80s]  What?
[5380.99s -> 5381.87s]  I bent it before!
[5382.59s -> 5383.23s]  Did you have fun?
[5388.52s -> 5389.00s]  I thought that...
[5389.00s -> 5389.40s]  I bet...
[5389.40s -> 5391.32s]  I didn't think I had to re-bend the spoon.
[5395.32s -> 5397.72s]  I bent it before I went up to talk to Hugh Bliss.
[5398.44s -> 5408.81s]  You suck so bad, Ella.
[5413.63s -> 5414.43s]  Dammit.
[5414.43s -> 5415.48s]  I can't see it from here.
[5416.28s -> 5419.77s]  And then you unbent it.
[5419.77s -> 5420.73s]  No, I bent it back though.
[5420.73s -> 5421.37s]  No, check the bot.
[5421.37s -> 5422.09s]  I bent it back.
[5422.97s -> 5424.67s]  I bent it back.
[5424.67s -> 5426.43s]  I've got people that can vouch for that.
[5426.43s -> 5427.23s]  I did bend it back.
[5438.41s -> 5439.05s]  Check the bot.
[5439.05s -> 5439.55s]  I did.
[5440.33s -> 5441.13s]  I did bend it back.
[5441.85s -> 5442.49s]  Wait, where is he?
[5442.49s -> 5443.45s]  Why is he not in there?
[5443.45s -> 5444.97s]  Wait, I gotta wait for him to go...
[5444.97s -> 5445.93s]  Just go back in!
[5446.65s -> 5447.77s]  I gotta wait till he jumps in.
[5450.25s -> 5450.73s]  Do it now!
[5450.73s -> 5451.53s]  Come on, shoot it now!
[5451.53s -> 5453.21s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[5453.85s -> 5457.95s]  Oh, we get to win.
[5457.95s -> 5465.34s]  Here we go.
[5465.34s -> 5466.30s]  Closed line incoming.
[5466.30s -> 5468.30s]  Three, two, one.
[5468.30s -> 5469.42s]  Oh, it's the hand.
[5469.42s -> 5470.14s]  That's what we needed.
[5471.34s -> 5476.83s]  Does he die?
[5499.55s -> 5501.50s]  Okay, so we've got...
[5502.54s -> 5503.66s]  Let's go out here.
[5504.22s -> 5505.26s]  See what's going on outside.
[5505.26s -> 5505.58s]  That's...
[5505.58s -> 5507.98s]  We have one of the three pieces we need of Max.
[5517.10s -> 5519.82s]  Before collapsing under the weight of his own laziness.
[5519.82s -> 5523.18s]  Anhui is one of the five fundamental forces.
[5523.18s -> 5524.38s]  He made it 20 feet.
[5525.18s -> 5525.98s]  No TV.
[5526.78s -> 5527.98s]  Why even go on?
[5528.54s -> 5531.66s]  You should all just lie on your faces and wait for death.
[5532.30s -> 5533.58s]  It's true.
[5533.58s -> 5534.94s]  I got nothing.
[5534.94s -> 5536.14s]  I'm a failure.
[5537.50s -> 5539.10s]  I thought people were supposed to be happy out here.
[5539.10s -> 5540.54s]  I don't want the verge of tears.
[5540.54s -> 5542.14s]  This guy's the death of the party.
[5543.66s -> 5546.30s]  What if it happened to people having a good time?
[5547.18s -> 5551.10s]  Hey, pseudo Max.
[5551.10s -> 5551.82s]  How's it going?
[5553.02s -> 5555.18s]  I need your tail for my little buddy here.
[5555.18s -> 5556.30s]  How about handing it over?
[5562.25s -> 5563.69s]  He's heavier than he looks.
[5563.69s -> 5565.05s]  Aren't we all?
[5565.05s -> 5565.85s]  Aren't we on the moon?
[5569.55s -> 5572.03s]  Wouldn't being on the moon make him lighter?
[5572.67s -> 5577.39s]  I'm not particularly interested in seeing the...
[5578.03s -> 5582.81s]  I don't think it works on people.
[5582.81s -> 5584.57s]  Except maybe if they're shaped like spoons.
[5588.16s -> 5588.72s]  Okay.
[5588.72s -> 5589.44s]  You have anything to say?
[5590.99s -> 5592.27s]  Howdy, Superball.
[5592.27s -> 5593.71s]  I can't talk now, sir.
[5593.71s -> 5595.31s]  The blue guy is really getting me down.
[5595.31s -> 5599.15s]  His supernatural lethargy is crushing my normally unbridled enthusiasm.
[5599.15s -> 5602.59s]  But Superball, you seem as chipper as ever.
[5602.59s -> 5603.23s]  Thank you, sir.
[5603.23s -> 5606.11s]  I work hard to put on a happy face, but I'm crying on the inside.
[5607.23s -> 5609.87s]  What about you?
[5612.35s -> 5613.47s]  Hi, Harry.
[5613.47s -> 5615.55s]  The blue rabbit's right.
[5615.55s -> 5618.99s]  I can't keep a job if my feet stink.
[5619.87s -> 5621.47s]  Why do I even go on?
[5623.69s -> 5626.17s]  Come now, Harry.
[5626.17s -> 5627.77s]  Give us a little smile.
[5628.49s -> 5630.01s]  Leave me alone.
[5632.57s -> 5641.40s]  I don't like this part turned it off.
[5642.20s -> 5644.06s]  Well, I can't turn it off.
[5644.70s -> 5648.06s]  All right.
[5648.06s -> 5648.46s]  Let's go.
[5649.10s -> 5649.34s]  Wait.
[5650.06s -> 5654.59s]  Can I put the bunny underneath here?
[5655.23s -> 5657.71s]  Can I slide him over here?
[5658.43s -> 5673.16s]  Eris.
[5673.16s -> 5675.08s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[5675.08s -> 5675.96s]  I'm just saying.
[5675.96s -> 5677.24s]  Like he's lying on the ground.
[5678.28s -> 5679.56s]  Maybe that'll make him get up.
[5680.36s -> 5681.64s]  I'll tell you what I mean.
[5681.64s -> 5683.40s]  Well, I'll show you something here.
[5689.23s -> 5690.43s]  We finally get to bend it.
[5690.43s -> 5690.67s]  Yes.
[5691.63s -> 5692.35s]  All right.
[5692.35s -> 5695.87s]  Now we can pull them out of the hat.
[5695.87s -> 5697.55s]  And I never pay for parking anyway.
[5698.11s -> 5703.39s]  That thing's been bent for a whole season.
[5703.39s -> 5704.83s]  I'm so glad to finally fix it.
[5705.47s -> 5712.94s]  Okay.
[5717.34s -> 5720.06s]  Holy heaping helpings of high fructose corn syrup.
[5720.06s -> 5721.58s]  He's eating everything inside.
[5721.58s -> 5722.06s]  Everything.
[5722.06s -> 5724.30s]  Bosco, do not freak out.
[5724.30s -> 5724.94s]  Attaboy.
[5725.42s -> 5728.38s]  Eat up so you'll grow big and strong.
[5728.38s -> 5730.14s]  What is the world coming to?
[5730.14s -> 5732.06s]  Bosco, pasta knobs.
[5732.06s -> 5732.86s]  I'll four.
[5733.74s -> 5736.54s]  Oh, my, that one does have an appetite.
[5736.54s -> 5739.98s]  At the rate he's going, his stomach won't even fit back inside you.
[5739.98s -> 5743.82s]  I've no need for my earthly stomach any longer, sir.
[5743.82s -> 5749.74s]  I'm on Pupus's handsomest of lemon, water, and sunshine.
[5749.74s -> 5752.70s]  As God is my witness, by the end of this day,
[5752.78s -> 5755.66s]  you will be eating cocoa nougat butterballs again.
[5758.16s -> 5759.36s]  Nougat really is so good.
[5760.00s -> 5760.72s]  It's so great.
[5761.28s -> 5761.68s]  All right.
[5761.68s -> 5763.20s]  So, uh, get him to...
[5764.64s -> 5765.04s]  We've got...
[5765.60s -> 5766.24s]  What does he say?
[5766.88s -> 5769.04s]  Excuse me, Mr. Vice Manifestation.
[5772.33s -> 5773.93s]  You look delicious.
[5774.57s -> 5775.29s]  Look, pal.
[5775.29s -> 5778.09s]  I need your stomach so I can put my buddy back together.
[5778.09s -> 5780.41s]  Hand it over and only one of us gets hurt.
[5780.41s -> 5783.93s]  I can't resist the rich, meaty taste of dog and rabbit.
[5785.93s -> 5787.45s]  Well, here we are in your stomach.
[5787.45s -> 5787.93s]  What?
[5787.93s -> 5789.85s]  What the hell did I just step in?
[5789.85s -> 5794.41s]  I'm enjoying the womb-like meditative quality of the pyloric sphincter.
[5794.41s -> 5795.29s]  Darn it.
[5795.29s -> 5797.21s]  Well, I've still got my magic, too, Hickey.
[5802.27s -> 5805.23s]  Something tells me I'm going to be smelling that for the rest of my life.
[5806.91s -> 5808.99s]  Well, that was, uh, disgusting.
[5808.99s -> 5809.63s]  We do it again.
[5814.75s -> 5816.03s]  It's beautiful.
[5818.94s -> 5819.90s]  Turn this off.
[5825.13s -> 5825.93s]  Um, okay.
[5825.93s -> 5828.08s]  So, hmm.
[5830.83s -> 5833.61s]  I wonder, can I do anything else?
[5834.89s -> 5835.85s]  Sludgey's.
[5835.85s -> 5837.13s]  This week's flavors?
[5837.13s -> 5838.97s]  Casper oil and Brussels sprouts.
[5838.97s -> 5839.29s]  Oh.
[5843.04s -> 5844.60s]  So we're...
[5844.60s -> 5848.04s]  Okay, we have to cover ourselves in something.
[5849.29s -> 5849.77s]  Has to be.
[5851.00s -> 5853.72s]  We have to cover ourselves in something he doesn't like.
[5854.76s -> 5855.48s]  Roast coffee?
[5855.48s -> 5856.12s]  I don't know what we're doing.
[5859.64s -> 5864.04s]  Somehow we have to make him eat us again, but this time with the coating he doesn't like.
[5864.04s -> 5866.84s]  I'm impressed by the gentle oscillation of the hot weenies.
[5868.59s -> 5868.99s]  Yep.
[5868.99s -> 5869.95s]  Still a garbage can.
[5870.51s -> 5871.63s]  I can't take the weenies.
[5876.48s -> 5877.84s]  Can I bend his stomach around?
[5877.84s -> 5878.08s]  No.
[5879.69s -> 5880.41s]  Well, I do...
[5880.41s -> 5883.53s]  I can go do the rabbit in the hat thing.
[5889.29s -> 5891.45s]  Because the rat is off.
[5892.09s -> 5893.48s]  I mean, the chicken...
[5893.48s -> 5895.96s]  The arc of the chicken can finally be concluded.
[5896.68s -> 5900.60s]  What about Sybil?
[5904.35s -> 5904.67s]  We're here.
[5904.67s -> 5905.39s]  Might as well just see.
[5918.06s -> 5918.30s]  Okay.
[5920.27s -> 5920.75s]  What's new?
[5920.75s -> 5921.87s]  Are you okay?
[5921.87s -> 5925.55s]  Hugh Bliss shot some kind of weird energy beam all over the planet.
[5925.55s -> 5927.55s]  Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[5927.55s -> 5928.67s]  Oh, no.
[5928.67s -> 5931.15s]  And I'm perfectly happy, Sam.
[5931.15s -> 5933.87s]  Oh, and hello, brother Max.
[5933.87s -> 5937.55s]  Tangerine dreams and aqua wishes to you this day.
[5937.55s -> 5939.07s]  Why, thank you, Sybil.
[5939.07s -> 5941.79s]  You're looking especially lovely today.
[5941.79s -> 5942.75s]  This is horrific.
[5946.14s -> 5947.66s]  How will you improve Canada?
[5948.62s -> 5950.86s]  Let's really get to the hard-hitting issues here.
[5955.76s -> 5957.20s]  You've got to snap out of it.
[5957.20s -> 5959.36s]  Snap out of what, friend Sam?
[5959.36s -> 5963.36s]  For the first time in my life, I've got a perfect job,
[5963.36s -> 5965.84s]  a rock-solid relationship,
[5965.84s -> 5968.56s]  and an incomparable feeling of peace.
[5969.36s -> 5972.24s]  I've never been so content in all my life.
[5972.24s -> 5973.36s]  Don't worry, we'll fix that.
[5975.44s -> 5976.88s]  Prismatology is a sham.
[5976.88s -> 5979.52s]  This prismatology business is all a lie.
[5979.52s -> 5981.44s]  Is pure happiness a lie?
[5982.16s -> 5984.64s]  Is peace on Earth a hopeless dream?
[5985.28s -> 5988.00s]  Are unicorns imaginary?
[5988.00s -> 5990.08s]  Mostly, probably, and it depends on-
[5990.72s -> 5991.76s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[5991.76s -> 5993.92s]  From a facility that processes nuclear waste.
[5996.68s -> 5999.64s]  All right, how's the date going with Lincoln?
[5999.64s -> 6001.08s]  How's things going with you and Mr. Lincoln?
[6001.08s -> 6002.44s]  Simply wonderful.
[6003.16s -> 6004.84s]  Isn't that right, Abraham?
[6007.80s -> 6009.24s]  Pretty lady.
[6010.76s -> 6012.92s]  He has such a way with words.
[6013.56s -> 6014.60s]  Why is he like this now?
[6019.61s -> 6020.49s]  Why is he doing this?
[6020.49s -> 6021.29s]  Why is he like this?
[6025.07s -> 6026.51s]  It sounds like Mr.
[6026.51s -> 6028.59s]  Look at me, I wrote the Gettysburg address.
[6028.59s -> 6030.67s]  Isn't as good with words as he led us to believe.
[6031.07s -> 6034.99s]  Oh, he'll be fine once he's managed to stop hyperventilating.
[6042.22s -> 6043.90s]  Are you two planning on having kids someday?
[6048.99s -> 6049.87s]  So long, Sybil.
[6052.16s -> 6053.12s]  What's up, A.L.?
[6053.12s -> 6054.48s]  How's the date going?
[6054.48s -> 6056.40s]  Oh, thank goodness you two have come.
[6056.40s -> 6057.04s]  Now we can talk.
[6057.04s -> 6058.96s]  Well, hello, Mr. Lincoln.
[6058.96s -> 6061.76s]  You're looking quite distinguished today.
[6061.76s -> 6063.12s]  What's wrong with him?
[6063.12s -> 6064.96s]  He hasn't been himself lately.
[6064.96s -> 6065.76s]  Whatever.
[6065.76s -> 6067.36s]  You've got to help me with this date.
[6068.56s -> 6072.56s]  The honeymoon's already over?
[6072.56s -> 6073.36s]  What's the problem?
[6073.92s -> 6075.28s]  She's really into me.
[6075.92s -> 6076.64s]  See there, Abraham?
[6076.64s -> 6077.44s]  That's the problem.
[6077.44s -> 6079.60s]  Oh, the Turk was a little bit of courage.
[6080.24s -> 6083.04s]  No, I mean really into me.
[6083.04s -> 6084.88s]  She's so nice.
[6085.60s -> 6086.88s]  It's giving me the creeps.
[6088.36s -> 6090.28s]  I thought you'd be used to blissed out people
[6090.28s -> 6092.84s]  after spending so much time at the moon retreat.
[6092.84s -> 6095.64s]  Sure, when you're around a bunch of other single guys,
[6095.64s -> 6097.00s]  that's one thing.
[6097.00s -> 6100.76s]  But this, what do I do if she wants to get intimate?
[6100.76s -> 6101.88s]  I'm not cut out for this.
[6102.44s -> 6103.80s]  There, there, Abraham.
[6104.44s -> 6107.08s]  That's just the yellow of your cowardice speaking.
[6107.72s -> 6110.04s]  Seriously, how long is he going to be like this?
[6110.04s -> 6110.92s]  I'm working on it.
[6112.04s -> 6115.29s]  How did you avoid getting hit by Hugh Bliss's
[6115.29s -> 6116.73s]  mind-altering happiness ray?
[6117.13s -> 6119.77s]  I miss the great blissification?
[6119.77s -> 6122.09s]  Dammit, I knew I shouldn't have stopped
[6122.09s -> 6123.93s]  by the gift shop on the way down here.
[6125.29s -> 6125.77s]  Anything else?
[6125.77s -> 6127.21s]  Do you know how to stop Hugh Bliss's
[6127.21s -> 6128.73s]  world domination scheme?
[6128.73s -> 6130.25s]  Why would I want to stop it?
[6130.25s -> 6133.13s]  Under Hugh Bliss, all men are created equal.
[6133.69s -> 6134.65s]  That's kind of my thing.
[6135.29s -> 6138.36s]  You and Sybil should think about starting a family.
[6138.36s -> 6140.60s]  This is all happening too fast.
[6140.60s -> 6142.68s]  It's been over a hundred years.
[6142.68s -> 6144.60s]  My stomach's doing backflips.
[6144.60s -> 6146.36s]  I don't know what women like.
[6146.44s -> 6148.92s]  Women like to be treated as equal partners
[6148.92s -> 6152.92s]  in love and trust, a foundation of honesty.
[6152.92s -> 6155.48s]  Seriously, make him stop talking.
[6155.48s -> 6157.32s]  I'm nauseated enough as it is.
[6159.56s -> 6160.20s]  Anything else?
[6160.20s -> 6161.72s]  You're ever the romantic, Mr. Lincoln.
[6161.72s -> 6164.12s]  Lucky at uniting a nation on the brink of war.
[6164.76s -> 6165.80s]  Unlucky in love.
[6166.99s -> 6167.95s]  You're ever the romantic.
[6168.83s -> 6172.35s]  Anything else from Sybil before I go do the hat?
[6172.35s -> 6173.31s]  Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[6175.40s -> 6177.88s]  Have you had any new ideas for improving Canada?
[6177.88s -> 6180.92s]  With this new feeling of peace and tranquility,
[6181.48s -> 6184.60s]  I feel like my mind is alive with possibilities.
[6184.60s -> 6186.28s]  See, it wasn't, A, Lincoln wasn't married.
[6186.28s -> 6189.96s]  I only wish there was some way to extend this feeling
[6189.96s -> 6194.68s]  of goodwill and generosity to all countries of the world.
[6195.40s -> 6198.84s]  I always suspected that when the world turned nice and pleasant,
[6198.84s -> 6200.60s]  Canada would be the first to fall.
[6203.04s -> 6203.92s]  So long, Sybil.
[6212.19s -> 6213.39s]  Ah, Sam.
[6213.39s -> 6213.71s]  Hey.
[6220.08s -> 6222.56s]  All right, let's go to the bird.
[6223.36s -> 6224.40s]  Chicken with the hat.
[6225.12s -> 6228.00s]  To the moon, Alice.
[6228.00s -> 6230.40s]  Can now do the trick, which I don't know what that gets us to.
[6231.04s -> 6240.17s]  I'm at that point in my, was drinking coffee.
[6241.29s -> 6242.25s]  Or it's just the ice.
[6243.37s -> 6248.08s]  And the ice is slowly melted into that gross freezer taste.
[6250.24s -> 6250.72s]  You know what I'm saying?
[6250.72s -> 6254.70s]  When the ice cubes melt and it's only that gross freezer water.
[6255.26s -> 6256.94s]  I hate that.
[6256.94s -> 6268.91s]  I gotta go refill it.
[6270.17s -> 6271.45s]  Just don't drink iced coffee.
[6271.45s -> 6272.57s]  I can't help it.
[6272.65s -> 6273.53s]  I can't help it.
[6273.53s -> 6274.33s]  I'm American.
[6275.05s -> 6280.76s]  I read this somewhere that it's only Americans put ice in everything.
[6281.32s -> 6282.12s]  Is that true?
[6282.12s -> 6283.64s]  Or did I get like Reddit lied to?
[6284.60s -> 6291.37s]  Okay, so now you should be able to do it.
[6291.93s -> 6295.04s]  How's it going?
[6295.04s -> 6295.68s]  Silence.
[6296.32s -> 6299.68s]  I believe I have finally mastered this pinnacle of
[6299.68s -> 6300.40s]  Hot coffee is better.
[6300.40s -> 6302.72s]  I bet you don't even use the metric system.
[6302.72s -> 6304.16s]  Rat from the hat.
[6304.96s -> 6307.68s]  I don't use the metric system and I drink hot coffee all the time.
[6308.48s -> 6309.44s]  I just like ice coffee.
[6311.36s -> 6314.40s]  I just remember I can't stand rats.
[6314.40s -> 6315.76s]  They're vile vermin.
[6315.76s -> 6317.68s]  Smile when you say that, Beaky.
[6318.40s -> 6319.28s]  Beaky?
[6319.28s -> 6320.08s]  Sheesh.
[6320.08s -> 6322.48s]  I hate this pulling out of the hat business.
[6322.48s -> 6324.24s]  Next time I'll find something better to hang it on.
[6324.24s -> 6325.20s]  What was the purpose of this?
[6326.56s -> 6327.04s]  Oh dear.
[6327.04s -> 6327.92s]  Did we get the hat?
[6327.92s -> 6329.76s]  There won't be a next time.
[6329.76s -> 6332.40s]  I shall never do this trick again.
[6332.40s -> 6334.72s]  Only Americans expect genuine info from Reddit.
[6334.72s -> 6337.44s]  If you would be so good to remove the hat from my presence.
[6338.16s -> 6338.48s]  Sure.
[6340.24s -> 6341.28s]  Okay, so now I have a hat.
[6342.24s -> 6344.65s]  So I have the magician's hat.
[6347.60s -> 6347.84s]  Hmm.
[6348.48s -> 6356.94s]  What am I pulling out of here?
[6356.94s -> 6357.26s]  Hey!
[6358.14s -> 6359.00s]  Okay, this is the...
[6359.00s -> 6359.80s]  I got the rat.
[6359.80s -> 6360.28s]  Now what if...
[6361.08s -> 6362.92s]  I can put him somewhere?
[6366.81s -> 6368.49s]  Yeah, I have a rat spawner.
[6373.96s -> 6375.64s]  Reddit, the front page of America.
[6376.36s -> 6378.89s]  Well, it was like an Ask Reddit thing.
[6379.61s -> 6381.61s]  It wasn't an article written by a scholar.
[6381.61s -> 6386.89s]  It was just, hey, Reddit, do you put ice in your...
[6386.89s -> 6389.37s]  Hey, Americans of Reddit, why do you put ice in everything?
[6389.37s -> 6391.05s]  And then it was people doing the long things.
[6391.05s -> 6392.49s]  Well, one time when I was in Germany,
[6393.71s -> 6395.95s]  I asked for ice and they looked at me strangely.
[6396.51s -> 6397.47s]  It was like a bunch of those.
[6398.27s -> 6403.88s]  That's...
[6403.88s -> 6405.40s]  I'm telling you, that's how it works.
[6405.40s -> 6405.88s]  All right, what do I...
[6405.88s -> 6406.92s]  Okay, what do I do with the hat?
[6409.15s -> 6409.71s]  Hmm.
[6409.71s -> 6415.55s]  I have the moon key thing.
[6416.11s -> 6417.39s]  Maybe...
[6417.39s -> 6418.91s]  Okay, I gotta pull a rat out.
[6418.91s -> 6420.11s]  Does anyone not like rats?
[6420.67s -> 6422.27s]  Can I make the rats like run somewhere?
[6422.91s -> 6428.41s]  I got a lot of items.
[6428.41s -> 6431.00s]  This makes people puke.
[6431.00s -> 6432.92s]  I have the key to the moon thing.
[6432.92s -> 6436.28s]  I can bend spoons with spoon-shaped devices.
[6436.28s -> 6437.88s]  And now I can pull rats out of hat.
[6438.68s -> 6449.71s]  Let me go back up in that room up here.
[6458.91s -> 6468.28s]  Well, okay, so I have these five statues.
[6471.02s -> 6472.22s]  Indestructible hues.
[6475.10s -> 6477.02s]  Uh-oh, chat's being weird again.
[6477.90s -> 6480.46s]  Prismatology is not the answer.
[6480.46s -> 6486.80s]  Unless, I suppose, the question is what's a really bad thing to...
[6486.80s -> 6492.80s]  Mrs. Betty Parkinson of 328 Cherry Lane,
[6492.80s -> 6495.34s]  ex-contestant, up to the moon.
[6497.20s -> 6498.00s]  Attention.
[6498.00s -> 6501.28s]  The owner of a celestial-class star cruiser license,
[6501.28s -> 6503.20s]  USS 1701C.
[6504.16s -> 6506.00s]  Please report to the front desk.
[6506.00s -> 6507.28s]  Your warp nacelles are on.
[6509.47s -> 6511.47s]  I want Sam to read me audiobooks.
[6512.99s -> 6519.80s]  And now, a medley of your lunar sent you la...
[6519.80s -> 6523.60s]  Oh, it's a callback.
[6533.64s -> 6533.96s]  Okay.
[6535.68s -> 6536.72s]  View screen.
[6536.72s -> 6538.00s]  I can see the whole thing from here.
[6539.04s -> 6541.87s]  I don't think I can do anything here.
[6542.99s -> 6544.03s]  Throw a rat at him?
[6544.03s -> 6544.27s]  No.
[6545.15s -> 6547.15s]  Maybe I can put a rat on the blue guy?
[6547.15s -> 6548.11s]  Have him eat the rat?
[6554.30s -> 6555.66s]  Just kill Hugh Bliss.
[6557.48s -> 6558.52s]  That's not how it works.
[6559.08s -> 6574.49s]  Okay.
[6575.21s -> 6575.53s]  Rat.
[6576.25s -> 6578.17s]  Will you move because of a rat?
[6583.10s -> 6583.60s]  Hey!
[6584.80s -> 6585.12s]  Nah.
[6586.16s -> 6586.48s]  Okay.
[6587.20s -> 6589.20s]  What about the unicorn?
[6589.92s -> 6591.92s]  I'm just gonna exhaust all options.
[6591.92s -> 6594.92s]  Do you like unicorns?
[6594.92s -> 6595.56s]  Not happening.
[6598.52s -> 6600.12s]  Do you like...
[6600.12s -> 6601.08s]  No, none of that stuff.
[6603.45s -> 6609.90s]  Well, we're gonna try to feed the rat to the green.
[6610.62s -> 6611.98s]  Hungry Max.
[6617.21s -> 6620.43s]  Urus.
[6620.43s -> 6622.03s]  Ah, the brute force strategy.
[6623.31s -> 6626.35s]  Brute force strategy is a lot of these point and click games sometimes.
[6628.16s -> 6630.16s]  And this isn't total brute force strategy.
[6630.16s -> 6632.40s]  I didn't do what I was doing up until this point.
[6638.67s -> 6639.63s]  This is nothing.
[6639.63s -> 6642.51s]  I remember the days of playing like original Monkey Island.
[6644.38s -> 6646.70s]  Or Toonstruck.
[6648.00s -> 6649.84s]  And those were so obscure.
[6649.84s -> 6652.40s]  Some of those things you had to combine like three items and shit.
[6652.40s -> 6654.00s]  Those games were ridiculous.
[6662.73s -> 6663.29s]  Okay.
[6663.29s -> 6663.61s]  Eat.
[6665.55s -> 6666.67s]  I kind of have to move out of the way.
[6675.28s -> 6676.00s]  Some of those games...
[6677.76s -> 6678.56s]  There's no way.
[6679.44s -> 6680.80s]  Maybe a guess if you could.
[6681.84s -> 6683.76s]  But that's kind of a game where you have to have a wiki.
[6684.88s -> 6686.16s]  Something smells good.
[6686.16s -> 6687.60s]  Hey, are you gonna eat that?
[6687.60s -> 6688.96s]  Well, I suppose I could share.
[6690.86s -> 6693.26s]  Toonstruck is like impossible without the wiki.
[6695.10s -> 6695.50s]  Now what?
[6698.60s -> 6699.56s]  Now make him throw up.
[6703.34s -> 6704.84s]  Did you get it?
[6705.08s -> 6706.36s]  Ah, done.
[6706.36s -> 6707.88s]  Next time I'm hanging on tight.
[6709.85s -> 6710.57s]  So hang on.
[6713.87s -> 6714.51s]  Do it again.
[6716.62s -> 6717.12s]  Hey!
[6718.68s -> 6719.40s]  Here, Max.
[6719.40s -> 6720.04s]  Come and get it.
[6720.68s -> 6721.87s]  So what happens if I...
[6721.87s -> 6722.19s]  Hold on.
[6722.19s -> 6723.07s]  Can I pull him out?
[6725.85s -> 6727.93s]  Is this gonna be Jerma Rumble live action?
[6727.93s -> 6730.97s]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great Saminian.
[6732.46s -> 6733.34s]  Hey, let go!
[6734.78s -> 6736.14s]  Is that my stomach?
[6736.14s -> 6736.86s]  Give me that hat.
[6744.57s -> 6745.07s]  Well.
[6747.63s -> 6748.03s]  Hey!
[6748.03s -> 6748.51s]  See you later.
[6748.51s -> 6750.35s]  I feel all warm inside.
[6750.35s -> 6755.39s]  Like my belly's a sort of cozy place where flavored popcorn and sugar drinks can meet and mingle.
[6755.39s -> 6756.11s]  That's my boy.
[6757.39s -> 6757.87s]  All right.
[6757.87s -> 6761.07s]  So we only have the blue Max left to take care of.
[6768.25s -> 6774.00s]  What would move that blue dude winning the lottery?
[6774.00s -> 6775.52s]  Scratch and sniff lottery tickets.
[6776.24s -> 6777.77s]  Hey, Bosco's mom.
[6780.54s -> 6781.18s]  What?
[6781.18s -> 6782.94s]  I thought you were Bosco's mom.
[6782.94s -> 6783.98s]  Oh, yes.
[6783.98s -> 6785.34s]  I'm Bosco's mom.
[6785.34s -> 6786.06s]  Hugh Bliss.
[6786.46s -> 6787.34s]  I need a bunch of money.
[6787.34s -> 6788.54s]  Identity really is a difficult concept.
[6788.54s -> 6789.66s]  How do you get money in this one?
[6790.62s -> 6791.58s]  We want to buy something.
[6792.22s -> 6792.72s]  Goodie.
[6794.54s -> 6795.34s]  Will you just give it to me?
[6795.34s -> 6796.94s]  One earthquake maker, barkeep.
[6796.94s -> 6798.62s]  A hundred trillion, please.
[6798.62s -> 6799.82s]  I don't have a hundred trillion dollars.
[6799.82s -> 6801.90s]  Aren't you feeling generous?
[6801.90s -> 6802.70s]  Yes.
[6802.70s -> 6805.34s]  But I need the money for my poor sick mother.
[6806.14s -> 6806.64s]  Hmm.
[6809.47s -> 6809.97s]  Uh.
[6813.34s -> 6813.84s]  Hmm.
[6815.63s -> 6816.67s]  One earthquake ma-
[6816.67s -> 6817.95s]  A hundred trillion-
[6817.95s -> 6819.31s]  What do you mean by a hundred trillion?
[6819.31s -> 6820.75s]  Do you mean you're being generous?
[6820.75s -> 6822.27s]  But I need the money for my poor sick mother.
[6823.07s -> 6823.57s]  Hmm.
[6825.60s -> 6826.10s]  Hmm.
[6828.44s -> 6828.94s]  Nevermind.
[6830.49s -> 6831.21s]  See you later.
[6831.21s -> 6831.71s]  Bye!
[6831.71s -> 6832.21s]  Hold on.
[6840.59s -> 6846.38s]  Do you have any parking meter that's fine?
[6848.80s -> 6849.44s]  Anything else?
[6850.32s -> 6853.77s]  I need the-
[6853.77s -> 6855.13s]  I think I need a Canada slogan.
[6864.86s -> 6865.50s]  Can I pick up the-
[6865.50s -> 6866.30s]  Can I call somebody?
[6866.94s -> 6869.05s]  I saw what you did.
[6869.05s -> 6871.37s]  Keep the payments coming and nobody has to find out.
[6872.17s -> 6873.05s]  Yeah, okay.
[6873.05s -> 6873.85s]  Love you too, mom.
[6875.96s -> 6876.46s]  Oh, mom!
[6877.16s -> 6879.69s]  No, that doesn't mean anything.
[6879.69s -> 6880.19s]  Never mind.
[6881.76s -> 6883.60s]  Roadkill calendar.
[6883.60s -> 6885.76s]  The endangered Point Arena Mountain Beaver.
[6886.32s -> 6889.04s]  Just yards away from a wildlife preserve.
[6889.04s -> 6890.72s]  Better luck next time, little guy.
[6890.72s -> 6891.22s]  Jesus.
[6893.84s -> 6894.34s]  All right.
[6895.77s -> 6896.65s]  What about the rat hole?
[6897.37s -> 6898.09s]  Anybody home?
[6899.45s -> 6899.95s]  Guess not.
[6901.04s -> 6902.40s]  Well, what would you know?
[6902.40s -> 6906.16s]  The crucial piece of evidence in the Hudson River Merman Strangler case.
[6906.16s -> 6907.68s]  I'll have to remember to file that once-
[6907.68s -> 6908.96s]  Is that what you say when you call home?
[6910.59s -> 6911.09s]  No.
[6911.09s -> 6912.83s]  I do not call my mother and say,
[6912.83s -> 6914.35s]  Mom, give me money.
[6915.55s -> 6916.05s]  No.
[6919.92s -> 6920.42s]  Wee!
[6926.36s -> 6929.84s]  President Moon.
[6934.38s -> 6935.71s]  Moon picture.
[6936.35s -> 6938.75s]  The moon was a lot nicer when it was still hard to get to.
[6942.06s -> 6943.82s]  Make somebody in the closet throw up.
[6950.08s -> 6952.00s]  Okay, this guy has tape on his mouth.
[6952.80s -> 6957.60s]  You want me to make the guy that puked that is tied up with a tape on his mouth?
[6960.22s -> 6960.94s]  Are you serious?
[6961.58s -> 6962.44s]  Hey, Leonard.
[6962.44s -> 6963.16s]  How's it going?
[6974.92s -> 6975.56s]  Oh, that was-
[6975.56s -> 6977.72s]  Hey, looks like your paperwork finally came through.
[6977.72s -> 6978.28s]  You guys cheated.
[6978.28s -> 6981.08s]  It's the deed to the United States and it's still moist.
[6982.12s -> 6983.38s]  Oh.
[6992.36s -> 6992.86s]  Okay.
[6993.48s -> 6996.09s]  Yeah, that was really messed up.
[7007.37s -> 7008.65s]  Use the deed.
[7008.65s -> 7009.61s]  Use the deed.
[7010.49s -> 7011.45s]  What, use the deed?
[7012.49s -> 7013.13s]  Well, hold on.
[7013.13s -> 7013.63s]  Let me-
[7014.17s -> 7016.01s]  Every time I pop in a tape, it's a mess.
[7025.21s -> 7026.01s]  Eat the deed.
[7026.57s -> 7027.45s]  Eat the deed.
[7028.01s -> 7029.29s]  Stop reading chat.
[7030.17s -> 7030.89s]  Well, I-
[7030.89s -> 7033.21s]  Look, sometimes it's gonna fall through the cracks when I see that.
[7034.01s -> 7037.84s]  Okay, so.
[7039.28s -> 7040.56s]  I'm gonna show her the unicorn.
[7044.92s -> 7053.18s]  Eat the debris.
[7053.18s -> 7054.22s]  Steal the china.
[7055.68s -> 7056.96s]  Steal the china.
[7056.96s -> 7057.76s]  Steal.
[7057.76s -> 7059.52s]  All right, let's go here.
[7059.52s -> 7060.02s]  Look.
[7060.56s -> 7061.06s]  No.
[7064.00s -> 7068.48s]  Max and I made civil throw up once before and that's something I never want to see again.
[7071.79s -> 7074.03s]  You look like you're in a shopping mood.
[7074.03s -> 7076.67s]  Might you be interested in, say, the United States?
[7076.67s -> 7078.27s]  What's the national debt?
[7078.27s -> 7078.77s]  How much is it?
[7078.77s -> 7081.55s]  Oh, lovely. We can call it Lower Saskatchewan.
[7081.55s -> 7084.19s]  What a perfectly delightful name.
[7084.19s -> 7085.63s]  Kid, for the tune of 100 trillion.
[7085.63s -> 7086.83s]  How much do you want to spend?
[7086.83s -> 7090.91s]  Oh, such a grand country deserves a grand price.
[7091.55s -> 7095.87s]  We simply refuse to buy it for less than 100 trillion dollars.
[7095.87s -> 7097.07s]  It's only fair.
[7097.79s -> 7099.39s]  We wouldn't hear of it.
[7099.39s -> 7100.67s]  That's far too much.
[7100.67s -> 7102.59s]  I'll handle this, Mr. President.
[7102.59s -> 7104.43s]  If you insist, Your Highness.
[7104.43s -> 7105.47s]  Is cash all right?
[7106.03s -> 7109.15s]  We've been dying to use the new Canadian trillion dollar notes.
[7109.79s -> 7111.39s]  Is that a picture of Celine Dion?
[7111.95s -> 7113.31s]  She's a national treasure.
[7113.31s -> 7114.51s]  Trillion dollar note.
[7115.71s -> 7120.96s]  Just did that in front of Abe Lincoln.
[7122.11s -> 7123.07s]  All right, let's go get it.
[7134.03s -> 7135.07s]  I got paid in Canadian.
[7144.24s -> 7151.56s]  Earthquake, then earthquake, and I'm good to go.
[7156.84s -> 7158.52s]  All right, let's have it.
[7162.86s -> 7163.74s]  We want to buy something.
[7164.38s -> 7168.00s]  We want to buy the Earthquake Maker.
[7168.00s -> 7169.28s]  Here you go, Bosco.
[7169.28s -> 7169.78s]  Thank you.
[7169.78s -> 7172.16s]  100 trillion in completely non-counterfeit bills.
[7172.88s -> 7173.38s]  Queen's...
[7173.38s -> 7174.08s]  Let me look at that.
[7174.88s -> 7176.48s]  Celine Dion.
[7176.48s -> 7178.64s]  OK, looks good to me.
[7178.64s -> 7180.96s]  Here's your Earthquake Maker.
[7180.96s -> 7182.48s]  A remote control?
[7182.48s -> 7183.36s]  Don't get me wrong.
[7183.36s -> 7186.08s]  I love TV as much as the next guy, but...
[7186.08s -> 7188.88s]  It controls my satellite defense system.
[7188.88s -> 7189.52s]  Only one button to work.
[7189.52s -> 7190.80s]  Satellite defense.
[7190.80s -> 7192.88s]  Just press it for an earthquake.
[7192.88s -> 7196.32s]  And this adheres, I hope, to all reasonable safety guidelines.
[7196.32s -> 7197.44s]  This is a real earthquake maker.
[7197.44s -> 7198.88s]  Who knows?
[7198.88s -> 7199.76s]  One more thing.
[7199.76s -> 7203.12s]  You have to be in range of the satellite for it to work.
[7203.12s -> 7203.60s]  All right.
[7203.60s -> 7204.80s]  Where'd you park it?
[7204.80s -> 7208.88s]  For some reason, I was suspicious of those blessed people on the moon.
[7208.88s -> 7209.36s]  It's on the moon.
[7209.36s -> 7211.04s]  So I left it up there.
[7211.04s -> 7212.72s]  How silly of me.
[7212.72s -> 7213.92s]  Got to use it on the moon.
[7213.92s -> 7214.72s]  Check.
[7214.72s -> 7217.20s]  Thank you, and goodbye, Brother Bosco.
[7220.96s -> 7221.36s]  All right.
[7223.37s -> 7227.05s]  This prismatology nonsense really gets my blood boiling.
[7227.05s -> 7231.45s]  That's from the heat generated by the limitless energy of your imagination.
[7231.45s -> 7231.93s]  What?
[7231.93s -> 7232.17s]  OK.
[7232.17s -> 7236.25s]  My limitless imagination is going to cause an aneurysm if you don't stop talking like that, Max.
[7236.25s -> 7238.73s]  What color of the rainbow would I be, would you say?
[7239.61s -> 7240.33s]  What do you guys think?
[7245.07s -> 7245.63s]  Never mind.
[7249.69s -> 7251.93s]  Like, by personality and everything about me.
[7251.93s -> 7252.41s]  What would it be?
[7256.57s -> 7257.29s]  Piss brown.
[7257.93s -> 7260.83s]  That's not a color of the rainbow.
[7266.51s -> 7267.55s]  Piss brown?
[7267.55s -> 7268.43s]  Oh my god.
[7269.55s -> 7270.75s]  I know what that looks like.
[7271.72s -> 7272.68s]  To the moon, Alice.
[7273.32s -> 7277.74s]  Do you ever have like a dark brown piss and you're just going,
[7277.74s -> 7279.74s]  holy shit, man, I got to drink some water?
[7280.89s -> 7282.65s]  It's happened like maybe twice in my whole life.
[7299.74s -> 7299.98s]  All right.
[7299.98s -> 7301.42s]  So we're going to earthquake him.
[7303.10s -> 7304.94s]  Earthquake maker remote.
[7304.94s -> 7307.02s]  Let's put the quake under here.
[7307.02s -> 7309.26s]  Let's see if I can get any reception for this thing here.
[7311.64s -> 7313.72s]  This isn't, I don't know.
[7313.72s -> 7315.08s]  I don't have brown pee, guys.
[7315.08s -> 7315.56s]  Don't worry.
[7319.10s -> 7321.66s]  Well, shame on you, Sam.
[7321.66s -> 7322.30s]  Cut the tail.
[7322.30s -> 7322.86s]  Cut the tail.
[7323.58s -> 7324.06s]  Cut tail.
[7324.06s -> 7325.42s]  I'll miss you, little pal.
[7325.42s -> 7325.98s]  Come on.
[7325.98s -> 7327.02s]  Is the streamer listening to me?
[7327.02s -> 7327.50s]  Cut tail.
[7328.30s -> 7329.96s]  Why is he not listening to me?
[7329.96s -> 7330.52s]  Cut the tail.
[7330.52s -> 7331.72s]  I'm going to be needing your tail.
[7331.72s -> 7332.44s]  He's not doing it.
[7332.44s -> 7333.72s]  My little buddy back together.
[7333.72s -> 7334.44s]  He's not doing it.
[7335.40s -> 7336.44s]  Whatever.
[7336.44s -> 7337.88s]  Sam, what are you doing?
[7337.88s -> 7339.32s]  You may not want to watch this.
[7341.37s -> 7341.69s]  Nice.
[7342.33s -> 7342.97s]  Kick cocky.
[7342.97s -> 7343.53s]  Cut tail.
[7344.17s -> 7344.57s]  Good job.
[7345.45s -> 7348.33s]  All of a sudden I feel like watching TV and eating orange marshmallow.
[7348.33s -> 7353.61s]  I was so invested and involved in an item that he's not going to use that no one uses.
[7354.57s -> 7354.89s]  Cut it.
[7354.89s -> 7356.49s]  Have I been away, Sam?
[7356.49s -> 7358.01s]  In a manner of speaking.
[7358.01s -> 7361.93s]  Hugh Bliss split you into pieces so you've kind of been all over the place.
[7361.93s -> 7363.05s]  Hugh Bliss.
[7363.13s -> 7367.85s]  I hate that guy now with his phony smile and his artificial happy happy.
[7367.85s -> 7371.13s]  What do you say we tar and feather that self-righteous jerk?
[7371.13s -> 7373.05s]  Good to have you back, little buddy.
[7373.05s -> 7375.93s]  Time to get ourselves some good old-fashioned payback.
[7375.93s -> 7378.41s]  And incidentally save the world in the process.
[7378.41s -> 7379.45s]  What are we waiting for?
[7380.57s -> 7384.89s]  He did end up using the melted ice cream axe for a large portion of the game.
[7386.49s -> 7387.13s]  Yeah, I know.
[7392.30s -> 7394.59s]  That's true.
[7398.35s -> 7399.87s]  But I did complain about it.
[7399.87s -> 7400.67s]  A lot.
[7400.67s -> 7402.35s]  I got really mad at it, remember?
[7403.64s -> 7404.36s]  All right.
[7404.36s -> 7408.88s]  So let's go back and talk to Mr. Bliss.
[7416.65s -> 7417.93s]  Worth this item.
[7417.93s -> 7423.32s]  What is this?
[7423.32s -> 7427.00s]  What's this straw pole here?
[7427.00s -> 7428.20s]  What color is Jeremy?
[7428.20s -> 7428.84s]  Green.
[7428.84s -> 7429.16s]  Yep.
[7429.16s -> 7429.96s]  All right, vote it.
[7429.96s -> 7434.12s]  Green, yellow, red, blue, indigo, violet, orange.
[7435.31s -> 7435.87s]  Green.
[7435.87s -> 7436.19s]  All right.
[7436.19s -> 7436.91s]  No, green is...
[7436.91s -> 7437.87s]  I'm all right with green.
[7438.59s -> 7439.71s]  I'm winning by a lot.
[7440.51s -> 7444.96s]  Yeah, no.
[7444.96s -> 7446.16s]  Brown's not on there.
[7446.16s -> 7447.76s]  I can see myself as a green.
[7448.40s -> 7452.19s]  Hold on.
[7452.83s -> 7453.15s]  Wait.
[7463.60s -> 7465.44s]  Color personality test.
[7465.44s -> 7466.40s]  Let's see if you guys are right.
[7472.96s -> 7474.96s]  Taking the color personality type test.
[7475.52s -> 7477.92s]  Personality color is equal to personality type.
[7481.82s -> 7482.46s]  Okay, hold on.
[7483.02s -> 7485.60s]  I'm going to take this on stream right now.
[7489.23s -> 7491.23s]  Damn, it's like 95 right now?
[7491.23s -> 7491.87s]  No, it's not.
[7492.59s -> 7494.35s]  Is it that hot in Vegas right now?
[7494.35s -> 7494.75s]  No.
[7494.75s -> 7494.99s]  What?
[7496.11s -> 7496.67s]  That was wrong.
[7497.39s -> 7505.21s]  Okay, let me open this up on stream.
[7506.25s -> 7507.77s]  And hold on.
[7514.84s -> 7515.64s]  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[7516.60s -> 7521.04s]  Color personality test.
[7521.04s -> 7521.76s]  Start the test.
[7521.76s -> 7522.96s]  Okay, let me just capture it.
[7530.43s -> 7531.39s]  I'll watch this be like...
[7532.03s -> 7539.55s]  There are a lot of questions on this test.
[7539.55s -> 7541.07s]  This is going to take like a fucking...
[7541.07s -> 7542.03s]  At least 20 minutes.
[7542.59s -> 7552.24s]  Why is everybody resident sleepering this?
[7552.24s -> 7553.20s]  You don't want to see this?
[7556.33s -> 7557.05s]  Nobody wants...
[7557.05s -> 7558.09s]  You don't want to see this?
[7566.08s -> 7567.84s]  There's a lot of resident sleepers.
[7568.48s -> 7580.06s]  Okay.
[7592.46s -> 7593.34s]  Oh, shit.
[7593.34s -> 7594.54s]  My like window captures,
[7594.54s -> 7596.62s]  because I'm doing two window captures at the same time,
[7596.62s -> 7597.42s]  so it's fucked up.
[7599.29s -> 7599.79s]  Uh-oh.
[7601.74s -> 7602.86s]  Uh-oh.
[7602.86s -> 7608.08s]  Oh, let me try again.
[7609.10s -> 7611.26s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[7617.18s -> 7623.56s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[7623.56s -> 7625.56s]  This is the shit I get drunk to see.
[7626.28s -> 7627.16s]  Well, all right, see?
[7628.36s -> 7629.00s]  Then we're good.
[7629.00s -> 7629.48s]  We're cool.
[7634.19s -> 7635.39s]  All right, this will work.
[7636.38s -> 7639.18s]  One moment.
[7639.18s -> 7644.57s]  There it is.
[7644.57s -> 7645.29s]  You should see it.
[7653.82s -> 7654.70s]  All right, so here we go.
[7658.06s -> 7660.46s]  There are so many ads on this site.
[7660.46s -> 7667.32s]  It's kind of awful.
[7667.32s -> 7670.36s]  Okay, so this is the test of what color I am.
[7671.88s -> 7674.60s]  How do you think other people might describe you?
[7674.60s -> 7679.98s]  A good innovator,
[7679.98s -> 7681.18s]  a good creative worker,
[7681.18s -> 7681.82s]  a good leader,
[7681.82s -> 7683.26s]  a good honest hard worker.
[7687.36s -> 7687.92s]  So this is...
[7687.92s -> 7690.88s]  Okay, so a good creative worker,
[7690.88s -> 7693.61s]  a good leader,
[7693.61s -> 7694.57s]  let us vote.
[7694.57s -> 7696.49s]  No, this is what I think of myself.
[7696.49s -> 7698.41s]  You guys just told me what color you thought I was.
[7702.67s -> 7706.59s]  A good creative worker.
[7706.59s -> 7710.46s]  Okay, next question.
[7710.46s -> 7712.46s]  When you're given a briefing paper,
[7712.46s -> 7713.42s]  what do you do with it?
[7713.42s -> 7716.24s]  What do you mean a briefing paper?
[7716.24s -> 7717.12s]  Send it back.
[7717.12s -> 7718.56s]  I issue briefing papers.
[7718.56s -> 7719.36s]  I don't read them.
[7723.36s -> 7724.96s]  Skim it for the...
[7724.96s -> 7725.52s]  What?
[7725.52s -> 7727.60s]  Skim it and pretend I read it.
[7727.60s -> 7728.96s]  Read it carefully and act on it.
[7728.96s -> 7730.64s]  Rewrite it and send it back.
[7730.64s -> 7736.25s]  I would skim it and I would pretend I read it.
[7736.25s -> 7736.81s]  I'd be like,
[7736.81s -> 7738.33s]  yeah, yeah, yeah, I read the whole thing.
[7738.33s -> 7740.65s]  I would make sure I pulled out one or two sentences.
[7740.65s -> 7746.76s]  Okay, yeah, I would skim it.
[7746.76s -> 7749.00s]  Imagine you had to put some furniture together.
[7749.00s -> 7751.40s]  How would you go about it?
[7751.40s -> 7754.36s]  Grab all the pieces and figure it out without instructions.
[7755.00s -> 7756.68s]  Follow the instructions to the letter.
[7756.68s -> 7758.04s]  Get somebody else to do it
[7758.04s -> 7759.08s]  and supervise them.
[7759.08s -> 7759.64s]  I wouldn't.
[7759.64s -> 7765.85s]  I'd be building my own furniture.
[7765.85s -> 7766.81s]  No, I wouldn't do that.
[7769.34s -> 7770.54s]  I absolutely would not just do that.
[7771.18s -> 7773.90s]  Do I want to not have a chair done correctly?
[7778.89s -> 7781.69s]  You literally did this test yesterday?
[7781.69s -> 7782.33s]  That's weird.
[7782.33s -> 7782.89s]  Labo is...
[7782.89s -> 7784.25s]  Yeah, I would follow the instructions.
[7784.25s -> 7785.95s]  I would.
[7785.95s -> 7787.87s]  You're asked to provide an assessment of a colleague.
[7787.87s -> 7788.83s]  How would you approach it?
[7790.27s -> 7791.07s]  Discuss it with them
[7791.07s -> 7792.35s]  and tell them what you're doing,
[7792.35s -> 7793.07s]  what you're going to say.
[7793.88s -> 7794.68s]  Discuss it with them.
[7794.68s -> 7795.72s]  See what they want.
[7795.72s -> 7798.76s]  See what they want said about themselves.
[7798.76s -> 7802.36s]  Give it to them and ask them to fill it out honestly.
[7802.36s -> 7804.12s]  Just fill it out honestly.
[7807.42s -> 7808.70s]  I'm definitely not this one.
[7811.36s -> 7812.16s]  You're asked to provide it.
[7812.16s -> 7815.04s]  I would ask them to fill it out honestly.
[7815.04s -> 7822.09s]  Which of these things do you value the most in a relationship?
[7822.09s -> 7824.33s]  Respect, unpredictability, companionship, interest.
[7825.87s -> 7826.67s]  Companionship.
[7826.67s -> 7827.47s]  Well, okay.
[7827.47s -> 7830.11s]  There are way too many questions for this joke.
[7830.11s -> 7831.55s]  This is like an 18 second joke
[7831.55s -> 7832.91s]  and it's going to take like 25 minutes.
[7833.47s -> 7834.03s]  I'm going to go quick.
[7834.03s -> 7834.67s]  Here we go.
[7834.67s -> 7836.59s]  You're on the street and you see somebody in distress.
[7836.59s -> 7837.47s]  How are you going to help them?
[7838.40s -> 7839.60s]  Take charge of the whole situation.
[7839.60s -> 7840.72s]  Go and fetch them a cup of coffee.
[7840.72s -> 7842.64s]  Call for the appropriate emergency assistance.
[7846.16s -> 7848.84s]  I would call for the appropriate assistance.
[7848.84s -> 7850.20s]  If you can't find a solution to a problem,
[7850.20s -> 7851.56s]  would it most likely be because
[7851.56s -> 7853.56s]  somebody else must have let you down?
[7853.56s -> 7855.00s]  You haven't shown enough imagination.
[7855.00s -> 7856.36s]  You haven't worked on it long enough.
[7856.36s -> 7858.52s]  You haven't looked at it from enough angles.
[7858.52s -> 7860.24s]  Well, I look at it too much.
[7860.24s -> 7861.20s]  I look into that.
[7861.20s -> 7862.80s]  I look into stuff way too many times.
[7862.80s -> 7865.21s]  So that's definitely what it is.
[7865.21s -> 7866.33s]  I just hadn't looked at it yet
[7866.33s -> 7868.09s]  from like a million different angles.
[7868.09s -> 7870.68s]  Which of these things do you have
[7870.68s -> 7873.24s]  do you value most about employment?
[7873.24s -> 7873.88s]  Stimulation.
[7875.64s -> 7877.48s]  If you overheard a colleague talking about you,
[7877.48s -> 7879.40s]  which of these statements would upset you the most?
[7882.83s -> 7884.19s]  They are so conventional.
[7884.19s -> 7885.31s]  They are not fit to lead.
[7885.31s -> 7886.59s]  Their ideas aren't very creative.
[7886.59s -> 7888.43s]  They are not a team player.
[7888.43s -> 7896.48s]  If a colleague is...
[7896.48s -> 7898.56s]  Why is this all about colleagues and shit?
[7898.56s -> 7900.24s]  Isn't this supposed to be my personality,
[7900.24s -> 7901.92s]  not other people's personalities?
[7903.80s -> 7906.12s]  If a colleague is upset, how would you deal with it?
[7906.12s -> 7908.01s]  Tell them to pull themselves together.
[7908.01s -> 7909.21s]  Try to find a solution.
[7909.21s -> 7910.89s]  Think of something to take their mind off it.
[7910.89s -> 7911.69s]  Offer them a shoulder.
[7911.69s -> 7913.61s]  I would take something to take their mind off.
[7915.16s -> 7917.08s]  If you need ideas from your team for a new project,
[7917.08s -> 7918.68s]  how would you garner them?
[7918.68s -> 7923.10s]  Informal meal to brainstorm.
[7923.10s -> 7926.80s]  Circulate an email.
[7926.80s -> 7929.12s]  Put out your own suggestions and ask for comments.
[7929.12s -> 7934.09s]  Demanding a paper from each member.
[7934.09s -> 7937.18s]  That would be that one.
[7937.18s -> 7938.78s]  If a new system is implemented in your office,
[7938.78s -> 7940.54s]  which of these is most likely to be your reaction?
[7940.54s -> 7941.90s]  It's always the office too.
[7945.21s -> 7945.85s]  Resistance.
[7946.67s -> 7947.47s]  Adaptation.
[7947.47s -> 7948.19s]  I would adapt.
[7949.37s -> 7950.17s]  On a football team,
[7950.17s -> 7951.77s]  which of these positions would suit you best?
[7952.65s -> 7954.92s]  Quarterback.
[7954.92s -> 7957.55s]  Which of these activities might suit you best?
[7957.55s -> 7958.03s]  Freerunning.
[7958.03s -> 7958.59s]  Running alone.
[7958.59s -> 7959.71s]  Running a relay race.
[7959.71s -> 7960.35s]  Running with friends.
[7960.35s -> 7961.31s]  I don't like to run at all.
[7961.31s -> 7962.19s]  Whereas I don't run.
[7969.39s -> 7972.35s]  Whereas I watch people running from the stands.
[7972.35s -> 7974.91s]  Freerunning.
[7974.91s -> 7977.58s]  Because then I can stop whenever I want to.
[7977.58s -> 7979.10s]  If somebody at work has made you angry,
[7979.10s -> 7979.90s]  how do you react?
[7979.90s -> 7981.50s]  Try and analyze what has made you angry
[7981.50s -> 7982.22s]  and the reason why.
[7983.34s -> 7984.54s]  Have a reasonable discussion.
[7985.47s -> 7987.15s]  Attack them at every opportunity
[7987.15s -> 7992.54s]  or keep it to yourself and let off steam outside.
[7992.54s -> 7994.06s]  It is absolutely not free.
[7999.77s -> 8001.61s]  I would probably keep it to myself
[8001.61s -> 8004.73s]  and just I'd keep it to myself
[8004.73s -> 8005.61s]  and then like go outside
[8005.61s -> 8007.69s]  and like scream at the moon.
[8007.69s -> 8010.01s]  From what you know of these countries,
[8010.01s -> 8011.61s]  cultures, etc.
[8011.61s -> 8013.93s]  Where do you think you would fit in best?
[8018.28s -> 8021.72s]  Germany, France, China, Brazil.
[8024.19s -> 8024.75s]  I don't know.
[8028.30s -> 8031.42s]  I do see come to Brazil all the time.
[8031.42s -> 8033.50s]  I do.
[8033.50s -> 8036.14s]  I swear to God that's not a meme or a joke.
[8036.14s -> 8037.42s]  I see it all the time.
[8037.42s -> 8042.72s]  Which of these would you say is your greatest fault?
[8043.28s -> 8044.24s]  I miss details.
[8044.24s -> 8045.44s]  I'm too ready to take orders.
[8045.44s -> 8046.40s]  I can be too critical.
[8046.40s -> 8047.76s]  I'm inclined to daydream.
[8047.76s -> 8048.88s]  Definitely that one.
[8048.88s -> 8053.96s]  Which of these sorts of car would you most likely choose?
[8054.52s -> 8057.92s]  People carrier.
[8057.92s -> 8059.36s]  Single seater sports.
[8059.36s -> 8060.32s]  Would one seat...
[8060.32s -> 8065.93s]  Is it a go-kart?
[8065.93s -> 8066.97s]  Probably that one.
[8066.97s -> 8072.03s]  Which of these would you be most satisfied with
[8072.03s -> 8073.47s]  at the end of a project you were leading?
[8074.11s -> 8076.11s]  That it surpassed expectations.
[8076.11s -> 8077.15s]  I got the job done.
[8077.15s -> 8079.23s]  That everyone did as I said.
[8079.79s -> 8081.76s]  That it surpassed expectations.
[8082.32s -> 8084.04s]  On a plane, do you think you would be the best
[8084.04s -> 8086.28s]  as a co-pilot, navigator, flight engineer,
[8086.28s -> 8087.16s]  or chief pilot?
[8090.03s -> 8090.91s]  Too much.
[8090.91s -> 8091.55s]  Too much to do.
[8092.27s -> 8094.06s]  Probably co-pilot.
[8094.06s -> 8096.06s]  Because you just have just enough responsibility
[8096.06s -> 8097.02s]  but you're not like the...
[8097.02s -> 8098.06s]  You're...
[8098.06s -> 8099.42s]  I'd be the co-pilot.
[8099.42s -> 8103.29s]  There's an important deadline coming up
[8103.29s -> 8105.05s]  and it looks like your team might not make it.
[8105.05s -> 8105.77s]  What will you do?
[8107.55s -> 8109.47s]  Ask whether the deadline was never realistic
[8109.47s -> 8110.83s]  and if it should be altered.
[8110.83s -> 8114.12s]  Drive the team onwards to work harder and harder.
[8114.12s -> 8117.13s]  See if there were any corners which can be cut.
[8117.13s -> 8117.85s]  Just keep going.
[8117.85s -> 8118.97s]  You can only do your best.
[8118.97s -> 8119.69s]  Yep.
[8119.69s -> 8122.43s]  All right, I want like a reveal here.
[8122.43s -> 8123.31s]  Hold on.
[8123.31s -> 8125.36s]  If you were climbing up a mountain
[8126.08s -> 8128.16s]  and a member of your team couldn't go on,
[8128.16s -> 8130.12s]  what would you do?
[8130.12s -> 8131.16s]  Split the team up.
[8131.16s -> 8133.00s]  Some to go down, some to carry on.
[8133.88s -> 8135.32s]  Leave them with the team
[8135.32s -> 8137.16s]  and carry on on your own.
[8138.16s -> 8139.44s]  Turn the whole team around
[8140.68s -> 8141.88s]  but carry on with the rest
[8141.88s -> 8143.16s]  you'll get them on the way back.
[8149.29s -> 8151.79s]  I don't know if I would do that.
[8151.79s -> 8153.79s]  I would probably split up the team.
[8153.79s -> 8155.07s]  Some go, you know,
[8155.07s -> 8157.47s]  I kind of want to stay up
[8157.47s -> 8160.65s]  but I want to go up the mountain.
[8160.65s -> 8163.98s]  Yeah, I would split the team up.
[8163.98s -> 8165.34s]  He's going to be dead when you come back.
[8165.34s -> 8166.27s]  Yeah.
[8166.35s -> 8168.19s]  In a conversation, what are you aiming for?
[8168.19s -> 8169.39s]  A solution, inspiration,
[8169.39s -> 8171.39s]  a consensus, agreement, inspiration.
[8171.39s -> 8174.91s]  What is your attitude to workplace friendships?
[8174.91s -> 8179.64s]  They are a good thing if they happen.
[8179.64s -> 8181.48s]  They have no bearing on success or failure.
[8181.48s -> 8183.00s]  They should grow organically, right?
[8183.00s -> 8183.88s]  Yeah, yeah.
[8183.88s -> 8184.84s]  Last one.
[8184.84s -> 8187.68s]  Which of these things make you the happiest?
[8187.68s -> 8189.36s]  A life in which others look up to me.
[8189.36s -> 8192.48s]  A life in which I plowed my own furrow.
[8192.48s -> 8194.08s]  A quiet, contended life.
[8194.08s -> 8195.36s]  A happy, exciting life.
[8195.36s -> 8195.76s]  Are you ready?
[8195.76s -> 8196.16s]  Here you go.
[8196.16s -> 8196.72s]  Let's see.
[8196.72s -> 8198.09s]  Green.
[8198.09s -> 8200.25s]  Green.
[8200.25s -> 8200.75s]  No.
[8201.93s -> 8211.32s]  No, that's cool.
[8211.32s -> 8212.36s]  It's P. Brown.
[8213.48s -> 8215.80s]  It's not P. Brown, okay?
[8215.80s -> 8219.20s]  Creator, performer.
[8219.20s -> 8220.96s]  You like to constantly challenge where you...
[8220.96s -> 8222.24s]  Is that supposed to be me?
[8222.24s -> 8227.45s]  You aren't prepared to accept the status quo
[8227.45s -> 8229.29s]  without seeing as things can be done differently.
[8229.29s -> 8230.65s]  You think very deeply about issues
[8230.65s -> 8232.01s]  and you always like to bring a new way
[8232.01s -> 8233.61s]  of looking at things to the table.
[8233.61s -> 8234.81s]  You're very enthusiastic
[8234.81s -> 8236.73s]  and will be popular with colleagues.
[8236.73s -> 8238.25s]  You must make sure that you follow through
[8238.25s -> 8240.01s]  in your creativity with concrete results.
[8242.68s -> 8243.32s]  Nice.
[8243.32s -> 8244.12s]  Okay, there you go.
[8244.12s -> 8244.92s]  I did it.
[8244.92s -> 8249.79s]  How do I get the last 30 minutes
[8249.79s -> 8262.57s]  of the stream back, streamer?
[8262.57s -> 8263.93s]  They stream sniped me.
[8263.93s -> 8265.13s]  All right, we were going back up
[8265.13s -> 8266.49s]  with that earthquake weapon.
[8274.62s -> 8276.06s]  Could have done it at the end of the stream.
[8276.86s -> 8278.06s]  No, it was relevant right now.
[8278.06s -> 8279.02s]  Hey, little buddy, get him.
[8280.44s -> 8281.80s]  Hi, I'm Hugh Blake.
[8281.80s -> 8283.24s]  Stop saying that!
[8283.24s -> 8283.74s]  Huh?
[8285.00s -> 8285.50s]  What?
[8287.74s -> 8288.70s]  How did he get in there?
[8288.70s -> 8290.22s]  You little idiot.
[8290.78s -> 8292.22s]  You've ruined my hypno beam.
[8292.86s -> 8294.22s]  I should have killed you earlier,
[8294.22s -> 8295.74s]  but what can I say?
[8295.74s -> 8296.78s]  I'm too nice.
[8297.34s -> 8299.74s]  That said, die, buddy!
[8300.22s -> 8300.72s]  Wrong.
[8304.41s -> 8306.81s]  What the?
[8306.81s -> 8307.77s]  Where you at?
[8310.00s -> 8311.84s]  We are a space-faring colony
[8311.84s -> 8314.88s]  of sentient bacteria.
[8315.84s -> 8317.44s]  A sentence I really did not
[8317.44s -> 8318.40s]  expect to hear today.
[8319.44s -> 8321.60s]  We cannot be harmed by bullets.
[8321.60s -> 8324.32s]  We only need one thing, to feed.
[8325.36s -> 8328.40s]  You see, we feed on the endorphins
[8328.40s -> 8332.00s]  produced by humans experiencing true bliss.
[8332.00s -> 8334.00s]  So, you don't care if people
[8334.00s -> 8335.12s]  are happy at all.
[8335.12s -> 8336.88s]  You just want to eat till you drop.
[8337.52s -> 8338.32s]  Yes.
[8338.32s -> 8340.00s]  Hey, I hear that.
[8340.00s -> 8341.68s]  But you want us to starve.
[8342.32s -> 8343.84s]  And for that, you will die.
[8344.96s -> 8347.28s]  In the most fantastic display
[8347.28s -> 8350.72s]  of the universe!
[8350.72s -> 8352.56s]  Hey, gotta look good for the cameras.
[8352.56s -> 8353.68s]  What cameras?
[8353.68s -> 8355.12s]  Pack your bags, Sam,
[8355.12s -> 8357.20s]  because you just want an all-expense
[8357.20s -> 8359.12s]  day trip to your grave.
[8359.92s -> 8360.64s]  So who killed him?
[8360.64s -> 8362.24s]  And you get to watch him die.
[8364.00s -> 8366.16s]  Let the magic begin.
[8368.97s -> 8370.41s]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[8370.41s -> 8372.73s]  for my first trick, I give you
[8372.73s -> 8375.61s]  the Rainbow Wheel of Death!
[8376.73s -> 8385.45s]  Also known as Emetics, the ride.
[8385.45s -> 8387.69s]  Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[8387.69s -> 8388.89s]  Add to Rainbow Wheel.
[8388.89s -> 8389.45s]  Not yet.
[8389.45s -> 8390.01s]  Exactly.
[8390.01s -> 8390.41s]  Not yet.
[8390.41s -> 8391.45s]  Throw some daggers.
[8391.45s -> 8392.97s]  No, hatchets!
[8392.97s -> 8393.85s]  Hey.
[8393.85s -> 8395.53s]  Sorry, I got excited.
[8395.53s -> 8397.45s]  I've got a better idea.
[8397.45s -> 8399.21s]  I'll just torture him mercilessly
[8399.21s -> 8400.17s]  until he begs me to shoot him
[8400.17s -> 8400.97s]  with his own gun.
[8404.99s -> 8405.71s]  Oh, well.
[8405.71s -> 8406.19s]  What's this?
[8408.97s -> 8409.53s]  What is that?
[8411.23s -> 8412.43s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8412.43s -> 8413.15s]  Spoon, Ben.
[8413.15s -> 8413.55s]  Spoon.
[8420.86s -> 8421.26s]  All right.
[8421.26s -> 8422.62s]  That Willy Mays never caught one
[8422.62s -> 8424.06s]  while spinning on a Wheel of Death.
[8425.74s -> 8427.42s]  Okay, and then we've got...
[8429.56s -> 8432.20s]  I have the Magician's Talisman Earthquake.
[8432.76s -> 8434.04s]  I don't think that's gonna...
[8434.04s -> 8434.54s]  No.
[8437.72s -> 8438.76s]  Put that back up here.
[8438.76s -> 8439.96s]  I think it only works on things
[8439.96s -> 8440.60s]  with stomachs.
[8441.08s -> 8442.60s]  Evil laugh.
[8442.60s -> 8446.08s]  And break magic rings.
[8446.08s -> 8446.72s]  Can't escape.
[8449.02s -> 8449.74s]  Magic junk.
[8449.74s -> 8450.46s]  I'm stuck.
[8450.46s -> 8454.84s]  I just bend them all?
[8463.64s -> 8470.41s]  Uh, what?
[8470.41s -> 8472.33s]  So that's how magicians switch places
[8472.33s -> 8473.21s]  with people.
[8473.21s -> 8474.01s]  By magic.
[8474.01s -> 8475.45s]  Oh, in retrospect?
[8475.45s -> 8476.49s]  So now he's stuck there.
[8476.49s -> 8477.53s]  I probably shouldn't have left
[8477.53s -> 8478.49s]  that lying around.
[8478.49s -> 8479.69s]  Way to go, Sam!
[8479.69s -> 8480.49s]  You did it!
[8480.49s -> 8480.97s]  Thanks, Willy.
[8480.97s -> 8482.01s]  It was that easy, apparently.
[8482.01s -> 8483.13s]  Frankly, I wish it had been
[8483.13s -> 8484.57s]  a little more challenging.
[8484.57s -> 8485.29s]  Kind of a letdown.
[8485.29s -> 8486.01s]  That's what I'm saying.
[8486.01s -> 8486.49s]  Excuse me?
[8487.21s -> 8489.45s]  I think you're forgetting something.
[8489.93s -> 8491.29s]  You forget something?
[8491.29s -> 8491.69s]  Me?
[8491.69s -> 8492.09s]  No.
[8492.09s -> 8492.49s]  I don't know.
[8495.77s -> 8496.62s]  Oh, yeah.
[8496.62s -> 8497.42s]  Oh.
[8497.42s -> 8498.94s]  My magic eight ball told me
[8498.94s -> 8501.18s]  to bring my antibacterial soap today.
[8501.18s -> 8502.54s]  Why didn't I listen?
[8503.34s -> 8506.06s]  Next up, the number one magic trick
[8506.06s -> 8509.50s]  at every priest modality party.
[8509.50s -> 8511.98s]  It's time to separate your bliss!
[8512.94s -> 8513.90s]  No, not that.
[8515.26s -> 8515.90s]  Don't worry.
[8515.90s -> 8517.26s]  This won't hurt a bit.
[8517.26s -> 8519.26s]  Until the saw hits you.
[8519.26s -> 8520.38s]  Then you'll die!
[8520.38s -> 8521.90s]  Cruesome!
[8521.90s -> 8522.54s]  I love it!
[8522.54s -> 8523.18s]  This guy's terrifying.
[8531.26s -> 8532.00s]  All right.
[8532.00s -> 8533.20s]  Well, I have like a second here.
[8535.31s -> 8535.87s]  Switch with him.
[8538.04s -> 8539.16s]  Swap all you want.
[8539.16s -> 8540.60s]  It drives the crowd wild.
[8541.80s -> 8543.48s]  Saw us, Sam!
[8543.48s -> 8544.68s]  We dare you.
[8544.68s -> 8545.48s]  Maybe I will.
[8546.60s -> 8547.23s]  All right.
[8547.23s -> 8547.71s]  Don't saw.
[8548.59s -> 8549.23s]  Don't saw.
[8549.23s -> 8549.71s]  Don't do it.
[8552.03s -> 8553.87s]  You're supposed to saw me.
[8553.87s -> 8554.67s]  Cue bliss!
[8558.12s -> 8560.04s]  For my next trick, I present to you...
[8560.04s -> 8560.92s]  Saw his head.
[8561.56s -> 8562.68s]  I'm not gonna do that.
[8564.04s -> 8565.48s]  The lunar lander?
[8565.48s -> 8567.72s]  It's the ticket to oblivion.
[8570.99s -> 8572.67s]  Enjoy your stay in outer space.
[8573.39s -> 8574.91s]  Until you die!
[8577.47s -> 8578.43s]  I think I know what to do here.
[8579.71s -> 8582.03s]  Lock the door and then switch.
[8587.95s -> 8588.73s]  Or not.
[8590.44s -> 8591.16s]  Sam!
[8595.58s -> 8597.02s]  I'll give the guy one thing.
[8597.02s -> 8598.38s]  He does put on a good show.
[8600.08s -> 8600.80s]  Okay.
[8600.80s -> 8601.60s]  So we are now...
[8604.17s -> 8604.81s]  Lock the door.
[8604.81s -> 8605.77s]  I can't do that now.
[8606.49s -> 8609.64s]  What do you mean, you can't do that now?
[8609.64s -> 8610.60s]  I can't do that now.
[8611.40s -> 8612.12s]  I don't know.
[8612.12s -> 8613.48s]  That first step is a doozy.
[8614.04s -> 8615.00s]  I mean, I could switch with him.
[8615.00s -> 8616.84s]  But do I do something like just do...
[8616.84s -> 8617.40s]  Earthquake?
[8617.40s -> 8619.00s]  I don't think that's gonna work again.
[8623.10s -> 8624.54s]  Lock the door from the inside.
[8624.54s -> 8627.18s]  And then he won't be able to unlock it from the inside.
[8628.14s -> 8628.62s]  Right.
[8629.18s -> 8630.22s]  You know, that's a good point.
[8630.22s -> 8631.74s]  But I'm just trying to think a thing.
[8631.74s -> 8632.46s]  It's a cartoon.
[8632.46s -> 8633.26s]  It's like a rocket engine.
[8633.26s -> 8633.66s]  I don't know.
[8634.22s -> 8640.64s]  This is fun.
[8642.46s -> 8644.38s]  It's okay, everyone.
[8644.38s -> 8645.50s]  I'm all right.
[8649.10s -> 8649.74s]  I heard that.
[8652.17s -> 8653.05s]  Consider this.
[8653.05s -> 8655.29s]  A trap so deadly it would cause you to die.
[8656.09s -> 8657.37s]  That is deadly.
[8657.37s -> 8660.97s]  It's the cleansing path of annihilation.
[8662.81s -> 8664.17s]  Oh, could we skip this one?
[8664.17s -> 8665.69s]  I kind of have a thing about drowning.
[8666.17s -> 8667.21s]  Oh, let me think.
[8667.21s -> 8667.77s]  No!
[8667.77s -> 8668.49s]  Don't drown, Sam!
[8668.49s -> 8670.01s]  So do I just keep switching with him?
[8670.01s -> 8670.57s]  Switch, little buddy.
[8670.57s -> 8671.45s]  That's such a boring way to die.
[8671.45s -> 8671.77s]  Oh, shit.
[8671.77s -> 8672.73s]  It's a dunk tank.
[8672.73s -> 8674.81s]  Try to get cut in half instead.
[8674.81s -> 8675.93s]  Thanks, little buddy.
[8678.04s -> 8679.80s]  Well, water tank.
[8679.80s -> 8681.48s]  I can only hold my breath for nine minutes.
[8682.44s -> 8683.00s]  I don't think...
[8683.00s -> 8684.52s]  I think I just got...
[8684.52s -> 8686.44s]  Is it just as simple as one, two, three?
[8688.28s -> 8692.99s]  Wait!
[8692.99s -> 8694.43s]  Bacteria can't drown!
[8694.43s -> 8695.15s]  Woohoo!
[8695.15s -> 8695.63s]  So I just...
[8695.63s -> 8696.91s]  I'm gonna have to anti-bacteria something.
[8696.91s -> 8699.52s]  Shut up!
[8699.52s -> 8699.76s]  All right.
[8699.76s -> 8700.40s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8700.40s -> 8700.88s]  Wait, hold on.
[8701.84s -> 8702.56s]  I have a second here.
[8703.90s -> 8704.54s]  Bacteria.
[8705.87s -> 8706.75s]  The guy pissing the tank?
[8713.60s -> 8714.40s]  Oh, no.
[8714.40s -> 8715.36s]  We have to do this again.
[8719.13s -> 8722.86s]  Magic junk.
[8723.58s -> 8725.76s]  Magic salt box.
[8730.20s -> 8731.64s]  So it seems like...
[8742.94s -> 8745.60s]  He's gonna keep going around.
[8745.60s -> 8747.20s]  I can't go anywhere but here.
[8747.20s -> 8747.76s]  Maybe I can...
[8747.76s -> 8748.26s]  Hold on.
[8748.66s -> 8757.17s]  Attack the dog!
[8757.89s -> 8761.52s]  What if I switch back?
[8761.52s -> 8762.48s]  I can't do that now.
[8766.21s -> 8767.89s]  Oh, well, now I can actually...
[8776.53s -> 8779.68s]  Just let him do it.
[8779.68s -> 8782.72s]  Having my bliss separated is not what the brochures made it.
[8782.72s -> 8783.76s]  I need to like...
[8783.76s -> 8784.56s]  I don't get...
[8788.48s -> 8790.64s]  I have to go pick up stuff.
[8793.04s -> 8794.00s]  Can I make a puke?
[8794.88s -> 8795.44s]  I'm just gonna do it.
[8811.66s -> 8814.30s]  I definitely have to play anti-bacteria.
[8818.72s -> 8827.38s]  Okay.
[8828.34s -> 8830.99s]  Anti-bacteria.
[8836.13s -> 8836.85s]  Here it comes again.
[8839.49s -> 8840.61s]  What's that on the table?
[8845.74s -> 8846.38s]  All right, so hold on.
[8846.38s -> 8847.18s]  Magic junk.
[8848.78s -> 8849.50s]  Microphone.
[8850.46s -> 8851.10s]  Crystals.
[8853.02s -> 8853.98s]  How do I get over there?
[8867.28s -> 8869.20s]  Okay, now magic crystals.
[8870.24s -> 8870.96s]  No, I can't move.
[8872.88s -> 8874.24s]  I have to bend shit then.
[8874.24s -> 8874.72s]  I have to...
[8874.72s -> 8875.22s]  No.
[8878.40s -> 8880.53s]  Is there anything I can bend from here?
[8880.53s -> 8881.65s]  Like this magic junk there?
[8885.17s -> 8888.59s]  He's impervious to gastro-kinesis.
[8888.59s -> 8889.07s]  He can't...
[8889.07s -> 8890.03s]  I can't make him throw up.
[8908.91s -> 8910.86s]  I mean, I can bend these,
[8911.50s -> 8914.13s]  but it doesn't really do much for me.
[8920.22s -> 8929.50s]  He had another spoon.
[8929.50s -> 8930.14s]  Another spoon.
[8930.14s -> 8930.54s]  Spoon.
[8930.54s -> 8931.04s]  Spoon.
[8933.10s -> 8933.50s]  Shoot him.
[8934.30s -> 8934.94s]  I can't kill him.
[8940.93s -> 8941.81s]  Magic rings.
[8946.34s -> 8948.34s]  You can't kill bacteria.
[8948.34s -> 8948.90s]  That's true.
[8949.86s -> 8956.40s]  Bullets won't hurt bacteria.
[8956.40s -> 8961.07s]  They match the items with the spoons.
[8961.07s -> 8961.87s]  That's what I was thinking too.
[8961.87s -> 8963.15s]  Maybe just put them back up there,
[8963.15s -> 8963.71s]  but I can't...
[8963.71s -> 8965.63s]  I think it only works on things with stomachs.
[8965.63s -> 8966.51s]  I can't put them up there.
[8968.99s -> 8971.63s]  You have to shoot each individual bacteria.
[8972.19s -> 8972.75s]  Next up.
[8974.67s -> 8978.80s]  I'm trapped.
[8979.36s -> 8980.48s]  Anything else over here?
[8980.48s -> 8980.96s]  Annoying...
[8982.00s -> 8983.84s]  Not one of those 3D images.
[8983.84s -> 8985.76s]  If God had wanted pictures to be 3D,
[8985.76s -> 8986.96s]  he wouldn't have made them 2D.
[8988.16s -> 8990.80s]  Can I bend it?
[8990.80s -> 8991.28s]  Earthquake.
[8993.84s -> 8995.92s]  Evil Gumball!
[8995.92s -> 8996.72s]  No, nothing.
[9001.14s -> 9002.26s]  Saw us, Sam!
[9003.46s -> 9004.50s]  All right, I'm just gonna walk.
[9006.34s -> 9006.98s]  Next up.
[9007.54s -> 9008.26s]  Oblivion.
[9010.42s -> 9014.85s]  Saw the Lander.
[9016.13s -> 9018.27s]  He doesn't let me move.
[9023.09s -> 9024.61s]  Nope, not spoon-y enough.
[9026.51s -> 9027.31s]  I can't escape.
[9028.03s -> 9028.51s]  I don't know.
[9029.79s -> 9034.94s]  May I spoon on the saw?
[9038.48s -> 9039.28s]  Bring this down here.
[9044.80s -> 9046.32s]  All right, switch it again.
[9050.18s -> 9051.14s]  Now, hold on.
[9051.86s -> 9053.26s]  There's a lock.
[9054.74s -> 9055.86s]  There's the crystals.
[9055.94s -> 9056.90s]  There's the water tank.
[9057.70s -> 9058.74s]  What if I break the tank,
[9058.74s -> 9059.38s]  and I shoot the tank,
[9059.38s -> 9060.10s]  and I explode?
[9064.43s -> 9070.69s]  I don't think this is gonna work.
[9079.63s -> 9080.83s]  You have to dissolve them.
[9080.83s -> 9081.63s]  That's not gonna work.
[9087.07s -> 9087.47s]  All right.
[9089.26s -> 9089.98s]  Keep going.
[9089.98s -> 9090.48s]  Saw.
[9094.29s -> 9096.13s]  All right, switch.
[9100.43s -> 9101.87s]  Put Bleach in the tank.
[9103.62s -> 9104.74s]  I didn't think I could move.
[9104.98s -> 9106.18s]  I didn't think I could move.
[9106.18s -> 9107.30s]  Why is he letting me do this?
[9109.28s -> 9110.80s]  He freezes me every other time.
[9126.21s -> 9129.42s]  Wait, I still have to stop each one of these
[9129.42s -> 9130.30s]  from being able to do...
[9130.30s -> 9131.02s]  Okay, I get it.
[9131.74s -> 9132.24s]  So...
[9132.24s -> 9134.96s]  Blending bath of annihilation!
[9136.53s -> 9137.97s]  So what's the deal here, then?
[9138.77s -> 9139.65s]  Okay, um...
[9141.70s -> 9142.20s]  Key?
[9143.38s -> 9144.10s]  No, no, no.
[9149.60s -> 9151.76s]  I need to make it so this is not functional.
[9155.16s -> 9156.92s]  I can't do that in this predicament.
[9156.92s -> 9157.42s]  Why not?
[9162.44s -> 9163.00s]  I'm stuck.
[9166.36s -> 9167.48s]  No, I tried to shoot the lock,
[9167.48s -> 9168.28s]  but the lock didn't work.
[9169.70s -> 9170.82s]  I can't pull the gun out.
[9179.14s -> 9179.64s]  Wait.
[9179.94s -> 9180.98s]  No, like, can I do this?
[9186.79s -> 9187.59s]  The door's just open.
[9194.02s -> 9195.46s]  Oh, I'm boiling to the life!
[9207.35s -> 9207.91s]  That was it?
[9211.91s -> 9212.79s]  Just boil him?
[9213.83s -> 9214.55s]  That's the end?
[9215.35s -> 9216.23s]  Oh my god.
[9220.55s -> 9245.00s]  Is that season one complete?
[9245.56s -> 9247.65s]  I think that's it for season one.
[9248.29s -> 9251.25s]  Is there a secret at the end?
[9252.21s -> 9253.97s]  Hey, season one.
[9253.97s -> 9261.33s]  Is there a post-credit scene?
[9272.08s -> 9279.65s]  Why would you do that?
[9283.73s -> 9284.69s]  Bright side of the moon.
[9286.85s -> 9288.80s]  That was cool.
[9295.25s -> 9297.25s]  Oh, you're unhypnotizing everybody, I see.
[9314.98s -> 9315.46s]  That's fun.
[9315.46s -> 9316.90s]  It's fun just playing these games.
[9316.90s -> 9317.94s]  Just kind of...
[9317.94s -> 9319.22s]  I love the hangout.
[9319.22s -> 9319.86s]  Just chill.
[9323.67s -> 9324.95s]  Play Sam and Max.
[9326.12s -> 9327.64s]  I would do something like The Walking Dead,
[9327.64s -> 9328.68s]  but I already did them all.
[9338.05s -> 9341.44s]  If you play Puzzle Agent,
[9341.44s -> 9345.36s]  I have you're probably wondering,
[9345.36s -> 9346.16s]  well, if you like this,
[9346.16s -> 9347.92s]  why play all these other ones?
[9347.92s -> 9348.96s]  I've probably played them all.
[9350.93s -> 9352.05s]  Wolf Among Us, I've already done it.
[9352.93s -> 9354.05s]  What's going on on the screen?
[9361.27s -> 9362.79s]  And those experiences,
[9363.43s -> 9364.95s]  you kind of experience it
[9364.95s -> 9366.07s]  and then you don't again.
[9367.38s -> 9368.90s]  So if I want to play season one
[9368.90s -> 9370.42s]  or season two of The Walking Dead
[9370.42s -> 9371.46s]  or The Wolf Among Us,
[9371.46s -> 9373.46s]  I already know the story
[9373.46s -> 9374.26s]  and I know what happens.
[9375.06s -> 9378.08s]  I wouldn't really want to play them again on stream.
[9384.02s -> 9389.03s]  You played all the post-Walking Dead stuff?
[9389.03s -> 9389.53s]  Yes.
[9391.46s -> 9394.48s]  No, I did not do Minecraft story mode
[9394.48s -> 9395.28s]  and I don't...
[9395.28s -> 9398.00s]  I'm not going to do Minecraft story mode.
[9398.00s -> 9398.72s]  It's not going to happen.
[9401.24s -> 9404.36s]  No.
[9413.91s -> 9415.59s]  You signed yourself up now?
[9416.87s -> 9417.83s]  No, I did not.
[9418.55s -> 9419.43s]  I just told you no.
[9435.78s -> 9437.06s]  I played Grim Fandango.
[9437.06s -> 9437.56s]  Yes, I have.
[9451.92s -> 9453.76s]  Play season two, you mean right now?
[9459.92s -> 9461.04s]  We have a couple options.
[9461.04s -> 9461.84s]  I'm going to take a piss.
[9462.96s -> 9465.04s]  We'll come back and we'll assess our options.
[9466.08s -> 9467.12s]  There are a couple things to do.
[9467.76s -> 9477.89s]  But I do want to see this ending credit sequence
[9477.89s -> 9479.25s]  because it is very, very fun.
[9483.27s -> 9485.51s]  Play episode one of Minecraft story mode.
[9485.51s -> 9486.63s]  I'm not doing that.
[9489.91s -> 9492.31s]  I'm going to have to be an eight or a nine out of 10
[9492.31s -> 9496.55s]  shit-faced for you guys to convince me on that stream
[9496.55s -> 9498.63s]  to play Minecraft story mode episode one.
[9500.31s -> 9501.27s]  2007.
[9501.27s -> 9501.77s]  Wow.
[9506.39s -> 9507.35s]  It was a long time ago.
[9508.95s -> 9519.32s]  My website is down.
[9519.32s -> 9520.20s]  I would assume it is.
[9520.92s -> 9521.57s]  Well, there you go.
[9521.57s -> 9522.45s]  That's season one complete.
[9523.46s -> 9524.10s]  It was cool.
[9524.10s -> 9524.60s]  It was fun.
[9526.79s -> 9527.35s]  I'm going to go pee.
[9527.91s -> 9528.63s]  I'll be right back.
[9529.35s -> 9531.35s]  And we will figure out what are we going to do
[9531.35s -> 9532.55s]  for the remainder of the stream.
[9533.27s -> 9535.51s]  See you guys in like two minutes, three minutes,
[9535.51s -> 9536.71s]  something like that.
[9536.71s -> 9538.07s]  Be right back.
