[0.00s -> 3.20s]  It's not a funny Thanksgiving special. Miku Picross.
[3.20s -> 11.03s]  It's not a funny Thanksgiving, it's just a Thanksgiving whine downstream.
[11.03s -> 14.78s]  I'm gonna talk very, very lightly, very slowly.
[14.78s -> 21.18s]  Write ones in chat, if you just kind of got the notification that I was live.
[21.18s -> 23.18s]  And you're on the couch.
[23.18s -> 27.86s]  And you got the phone in one hand and one of your eyes are open looking at it.
[27.86s -> 32.23s]  And you're just kind of on the couch, just, oh shit, he's live.
[32.23s -> 34.47s]  I'm just gonna chill today.
[34.47s -> 40.06s]  I'm not gonna talk loud. I'm gonna do some Miku Picross.
[40.06s -> 48.49s]  What do you mean two? What do you mean two? Where are you?
[48.49s -> 51.75s]  ASMR Andy.
[51.75s -> 56.27s]  We're gonna play, alright, so let's go over this.
[56.27s -> 59.58s]  I know a lot of people are like, what are you doing?
[59.58s -> 64.58s]  I saw that Miku Picross came out two days ago. Three days ago.
[64.58s -> 71.46s]  I was like, oh, I remember I played that Miku game and everyone was like, oh, everyone loved it.
[71.46s -> 73.90s]  I love Picross.
[73.90s -> 78.78s]  Of course, I'm gonna play the Miku Picross game that comes out.
[78.78s -> 84.78s]  And I don't want to hear it from people in chat that this game came out a year ago on the Switch.
[84.78s -> 91.73s]  I am a PC CD-ROM player.
[91.73s -> 94.10s]  But yeah, let's just chill.
[94.10s -> 97.78s]  We're gonna do a relaxing Thanksgiving whine down.
[97.78s -> 100.78s]  Maybe the stream will, I don't know, maybe a couple hours, two, three hours, just to relax.
[100.78s -> 110.15s]  I don't need to do anything crazy today, just to chill.
[110.15s -> 114.31s]  Hope you had a good Thanksgiving.
[114.31s -> 117.31s]  In offline chat, people were saying that I should do the Thanksgiving tier list.
[117.31s -> 118.31s]  I already did it.
[118.31s -> 123.90s]  But if you just need a quick refresh.
[123.90s -> 127.90s]  Hold on, I don't want to like burp on you.
[127.90s -> 136.29s]  Okay, so Thanksgiving tier list, I believe.
[136.29s -> 137.29s]  Stuffing and mashed potatoes.
[137.29s -> 140.29s]  Stuffing is S tier. It's the highest thing.
[140.29s -> 147.46s]  Mashed potatoes are also somewhere around early S, maybe A.
[147.46s -> 150.46s]  Maybe mid A, mid S.
[150.46s -> 154.72s]  And there's a lot of new viewers, so let's go over this.
[154.72s -> 159.22s]  And I told you we were gonna relax today, but I'm gonna get a little angry right now.
[159.22s -> 162.22s]  Because people are gonna get mad at me and I'm gonna get angry back.
[162.22s -> 167.22s]  This is the only time we're gonna get an elevated vocal range here, okay?
[167.22s -> 181.45s]  So I think that canned cranberry sauce is 100 times better than real cranberry sauce.
[181.45s -> 187.14s]  The stuff that's in the can, that comes out and it's shaped like a can when it comes out.
[187.14s -> 188.70s]  Like a cartoon.
[188.70s -> 198.01s]  And when that, listen, when you turn that sideways so it's the shape of the can cranberry sauce.
[198.01s -> 200.01s]  It's more like a cranberry jelly.
[200.01s -> 202.59s]  Exactly.
[202.59s -> 208.02s]  You turn it sideways and you slice hockey pucks.
[208.02s -> 210.02s]  A little bit thinner than a hockey puck.
[210.02s -> 214.02s]  But hockey puck, hockey puck, hockey puck, hockey puck.
[214.02s -> 217.52s]  Spatula that up, get it on your plate.
[217.52s -> 224.76s]  You now have the opportunity to take cranberry jelly, cranberry sauce whenever you want.
[224.76s -> 226.76s]  It's not gonna get all over everything.
[226.76s -> 234.76s]  Sometimes you don't want cranberry sauce all over your mashed potatoes and the turkey and the potato, you know what I'm saying?
[234.76s -> 245.75s]  It gives you the opportunity to take a sliver of that cranberry puck and put the cream cheese spread it onto the turkey.
[245.75s -> 248.99s]  It's, I'm telling you, that's S+.
[248.99s -> 259.48s]  Hockey, like hockey puck size, not hockey puck texture or flavor.
[259.48s -> 266.14s]  It had to be, okay.
[266.14s -> 272.14s]  It had to be hovered right over the end stream button and I pressed space accidentally.
[272.14s -> 276.45s]  Well, all right.
[276.45s -> 278.45s]  I'm live, I'm here.
[278.45s -> 286.83s]  What a bad stream.
[286.83s -> 288.83s]  Can you imagine?
[288.83s -> 295.52s]  I just go live for two minutes to talk about how much I like hockey puck cranberry sauce and leave.
[295.52s -> 303.66s]  That actually is kind of funny and I could have just stuck with that.
[303.66s -> 308.66s]  I apologize for those of you that, let's get, should I explain this again for everyone that just came back?
[308.66s -> 314.08s]  I need to explain this because people are gonna be like, what the fuck happened?
[314.08s -> 321.57s]  Wait for people to refresh.
[321.57s -> 324.77s]  You have 20 more seconds.
[324.77s -> 326.14s]  Okay.
[326.14s -> 327.14s]  All right.
[327.14s -> 329.14s]  So I'm imagining people have refreshed.
[329.14s -> 331.14s]  Let's just go over really quickly what just happened.
[331.14s -> 336.14s]  So I hit the, I hit the go live button on my OBS over here and didn't move the mouse.
[336.14s -> 338.14s]  I just press go live and now here I am.
[338.14s -> 339.14s]  And I'm talking to you, right?
[339.14s -> 342.14s]  Like after a minute or so, I didn't move the mouse.
[342.14s -> 349.14s]  So I accidentally in a rage talking about the cranberry sauce, hit space bar, which is confirm.
[349.14s -> 352.31s]  And it was hovering over the end stream button because I never moved the mouse.
[352.31s -> 353.31s]  There you go.
[353.31s -> 355.31s]  So now I don't, I don't have to explain it again.
[355.31s -> 363.11s]  I wish we should probably wait another few minutes and I'll explain it again for people to refresh another five minutes or so.
[363.11s -> 368.96s]  All right.
[368.96s -> 374.52s]  So today it's going to be a chill Miku Picross stream.
[374.52s -> 376.52s]  I don't have no idea what's in this game.
[376.52s -> 381.52s]  All I know is that I love Picross and I mean, I've played the Miku game.
[381.52s -> 382.52s]  Why not?
[382.52s -> 383.52s]  These are two things that are real.
[383.52s -> 385.52s]  I'm, I've played them.
[385.52s -> 391.30s]  Yeah.
[391.30s -> 392.30s]  We're only going to be live for maybe a couple of hours.
[392.30s -> 393.30s]  I just want, I don't know.
[393.30s -> 395.30s]  I want to do this thing.
[395.30s -> 397.48s]  I want to start doing more of this.
[397.48s -> 401.04s]  I kind of had this like epiphany and this is, I'm like not joking around.
[401.04s -> 404.04s]  I'm like, I mean this completely and fully.
[404.04s -> 413.71s]  I kind of like the idea of every so often just going live and it's, we just kind of chill and hang out maybe for a couple hours or something.
[413.71s -> 414.71s]  Just randomly.
[414.71s -> 417.71s]  I like that idea a lot.
[417.71s -> 422.38s]  A little bit more low energy stream sometimes because I feel like I'm so high energy all the time.
[422.38s -> 426.26s]  And that's like the only thing you ever see.
[426.26s -> 427.26s]  Right.
[427.26s -> 433.46s]  Like I'm always like so high energy, but like it's like, it's like five, six o'clock in the afternoon, evening.
[433.46s -> 438.46s]  I think we maybe I could maybe we get a couple of chill streams every now and again.
[438.46s -> 442.58s]  Right.
[442.58s -> 443.58s]  I know.
[443.58s -> 446.58s]  And look, you can have a chill stream and scream sometimes.
[446.58s -> 449.58s]  I know that sounds weird, but it happens.
[449.58s -> 454.96s]  But I know I'm going to just chill out.
[454.96s -> 459.96s]  I know that I'm going to get the question wrong and I'm going to scream, but it's all right.
[459.96s -> 460.96s]  We're still chilling out.
[460.96s -> 461.96s]  We're just hanging out.
[461.96s -> 462.96s]  Right.
[462.96s -> 465.52s]  You need to hit the bong.
[465.52s -> 467.02s]  No, no.
[467.02s -> 472.92s]  But I'll tell you, that's where opportunities like me strong playthrough.
[472.92s -> 473.92s]  Right.
[473.92s -> 475.74s]  Bring back the comb streams.
[475.74s -> 476.74s]  Yeah.
[476.74s -> 477.74s]  That's what I mean.
[477.74s -> 481.83s]  We could have, you know, this high energy streams and there's low energy streams.
[481.83s -> 484.83s]  I think it's a nice experiment to see how this works.
[484.83s -> 487.20s]  But I'm ready.
[487.20s -> 494.20s]  How do you have a low energy stream when like Miku is just banging like just blaring in the background?
[494.20s -> 499.95s]  Like when Miku is just like, what's the song?
[499.95s -> 511.24s]  No, that was wrong.
[511.24s -> 512.24s]  I did the wrong song.
[512.24s -> 517.12s]  That was Nyan Cat.
[517.12s -> 518.12s]  Everybody chill out.
[518.12s -> 520.12s]  This is supposed to be a relaxing night.
[520.12s -> 523.81s]  This is supposed to be a relaxing night.
[523.81s -> 524.81s]  That was Nyan Cat.
[524.81s -> 525.81s]  All right.
[525.81s -> 526.81s]  I'm sorry.
[526.81s -> 528.18s]  I've got it wrong.
[528.18s -> 529.18s]  Isn't there?
[529.18s -> 530.18s]  No, no.
[530.18s -> 531.18s]  I had it right.
[531.18s -> 532.18s]  I did have it right.
[532.18s -> 534.18s]  That's a Miku song.
[534.18s -> 535.18s]  I'm telling everybody.
[535.18s -> 539.57s]  This is a real Thanksgiving relax stream.
[539.57s -> 540.57s]  True Miku fan.
[540.57s -> 541.57s]  That's right.
[541.57s -> 544.57s]  So when that's just blaring in the background, it's going to be hard to relax.
[544.57s -> 545.57s]  All right.
[545.57s -> 546.57s]  Everybody relax.
[546.57s -> 549.57s]  We need to collectively just hang out.
[549.57s -> 550.57s]  Okay.
[550.57s -> 551.57s]  All right.
[551.57s -> 554.73s]  I'm pressing the button.
[554.73s -> 557.89s]  You guys hear it?
[557.89s -> 558.89s]  I can't hear it.
[558.89s -> 560.64s]  When is the chill going to happen?
[560.64s -> 562.64s]  We're chilling as of exact.
[562.64s -> 565.14s]  Hey, look, I'm early too.
[565.14s -> 566.14s]  The stream hasn't even started yet.
[566.14s -> 569.78s]  You can play Fall Guys.
[569.78s -> 571.78s]  I'm not going to ever play Fall Guys ever again.
[573.09s -> 577.57s]  I'm just telling you, that's a fact.
[577.57s -> 579.57s]  I don't have anything against the game.
[579.57s -> 583.38s]  I'm just never playing that game ever, ever again.
[583.38s -> 585.38s]  It's a fun, cute game.
[585.38s -> 586.38s]  It's like a fun experience.
[586.38s -> 588.38s]  I'm just never going to play it ever again.
[588.38s -> 589.38s]  That's it.
[590.38s -> 600.26s]  Face reveal.
[600.26s -> 601.70s]  All right.
[601.70s -> 602.70s]  So here we go.
[602.70s -> 604.70s]  Picross is fun.
[604.70s -> 606.70s]  If you've never played it before, you're about to see how it works.
[606.70s -> 607.70s]  I know I'm not going to.
[607.70s -> 608.70s]  Okay.
[608.70s -> 613.06s]  Last time I played Picross, I explained how the Picross worked every 30 seconds.
[614.06s -> 617.43s]  So I'm not going to do that tonight.
[617.43s -> 619.43s]  We're just going to chill and play it.
[619.43s -> 621.18s]  What happened to your face?
[621.18s -> 623.18s]  I haven't shaved in like a week.
[623.18s -> 624.18s]  That's what happened.
[624.18s -> 626.00s]  Okay.
[626.00s -> 633.24s]  So normal puzzles, special puzzles, music, gallery, settings.
[633.24s -> 635.24s]  I already did the settings a little bit.
[635.24s -> 638.99s]  Listen to music and unlock new songs.
[638.99s -> 639.99s]  How do I do that?
[639.99s -> 641.74s]  How do I do that?
[641.74s -> 645.10s]  I need money.
[645.10s -> 649.62s]  Well, you guys have to tell me which one you think is good.
[653.03s -> 657.06s]  Oh, we can unlock music.
[657.06s -> 662.12s]  Why does your chin have cell shading?
[662.12s -> 665.47s]  I don't know.
[665.47s -> 666.47s]  All right.
[666.47s -> 667.47s]  Let's play.
[667.47s -> 668.47s]  Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[668.47s -> 669.47s]  Hope you had a good one.
[669.47s -> 673.86s]  Hope you had a lot of turkey, a lot of and all that good stuff.
[673.86s -> 674.86s]  All right.
[674.86s -> 675.86s]  So here we go.
[675.86s -> 677.62s]  So these are going to be really easy.
[677.62s -> 680.62s]  It's going to be like, it's going to be impossible for me to lose these.
[680.62s -> 681.62s]  Let's go.
[681.62s -> 682.62s]  Level one.
[682.62s -> 683.62s]  Here we go.
[683.62s -> 688.63s]  Wait, I can move the camera.
[688.63s -> 689.63s]  Actually, that's not a bad place for it.
[689.63s -> 690.63s]  This is fine over here.
[690.63s -> 692.45s]  Is there a timer?
[692.45s -> 693.45s]  There is.
[693.45s -> 694.45s]  All right.
[694.45s -> 695.45s]  So how Picross works?
[695.45s -> 696.45s]  I'm not doing that.
[696.45s -> 697.45s]  Stop.
[697.45s -> 699.97s]  OK, there's five.
[699.97s -> 702.59s]  I didn't mean to press that.
[702.59s -> 703.59s]  It just went over there.
[703.59s -> 704.59s]  I'm restarting.
[704.59s -> 707.56s]  OK.
[707.56s -> 711.36s]  That's that row of five.
[711.36s -> 712.36s]  All five.
[712.36s -> 713.36s]  There's five.
[713.36s -> 719.14s]  Do I have to explain this?
[719.14s -> 720.14s]  All right.
[720.14s -> 721.14s]  So hold on.
[721.14s -> 722.14s]  Paint.
[722.14s -> 723.14s]  What does check?
[723.14s -> 725.09s]  Because X is mark.
[725.09s -> 726.33s]  B is check.
[726.33s -> 727.33s]  Oh, OK.
[727.33s -> 728.33s]  I like doing it like that.
[728.33s -> 729.57s]  I'm not doing a hint.
[729.57s -> 731.57s]  So let's just go over this real quick.
[731.57s -> 732.57s]  Explain.
[732.57s -> 733.57s]  Explain.
[733.57s -> 735.00s]  All right.
[735.00s -> 736.30s]  I'll explain.
[736.30s -> 737.30s]  OK.
[737.30s -> 738.30s]  Shit, I have to explain.
[739.74s -> 742.42s]  This is a relaxing stream.
[742.42s -> 743.42s]  OK.
[743.42s -> 747.42s]  So Picross is a video puzzle.
[747.42s -> 749.73s]  But you can do it on paper, too.
[749.73s -> 756.47s]  But so the first...
[756.47s -> 759.47s]  My chin is real, I swear.
[759.47s -> 760.47s]  OK.
[760.47s -> 764.03s]  So how you play Picross is...
[764.03s -> 765.03s]  You see the numbers on the...
[765.03s -> 766.03s]  I'm getting trolled.
[766.03s -> 772.26s]  OK.
[772.26s -> 773.26s]  So there's the two.
[773.26s -> 777.45s]  There it is.
[777.45s -> 778.45s]  So what do we make?
[778.45s -> 783.23s]  How does this game work?
[783.23s -> 785.23s]  Let's go type in, like, how does pic...
[785.23s -> 786.23s]  Oh, I unlocked some artwork.
[786.23s -> 803.22s]  Oh, my God.
[803.22s -> 804.22s]  There's a lot of stuff here.
[804.22s -> 807.25s]  Wait a minute.
[807.25s -> 808.25s]  Can't I already see it?
[808.25s -> 814.10s]  Cool.
[814.10s -> 816.10s]  There's a lot of levels.
[816.10s -> 817.10s]  All right.
[817.10s -> 818.10s]  I'm down.
[818.10s -> 819.98s]  OK.
[819.98s -> 820.98s]  I'm...
[820.98s -> 823.98s]  People are not going to stop saying it, so I'm going to explain it very quickly.
[823.98s -> 824.98s]  OK.
[824.98s -> 825.98s]  Let's do it very quickly.
[825.98s -> 826.98s]  In under 30 seconds.
[826.98s -> 833.82s]  If I go over 30 seconds, I'll turn the screen off.
[833.82s -> 839.42s]  The left and right are numbers, which indicate how many cubes need to be filled in in that
[839.42s -> 840.42s]  row or column.
[840.42s -> 845.66s]  For instance, there has to be five filled in long ways here because the five at the
[845.66s -> 847.34s]  top is how much needs to be there.
[847.34s -> 851.34s]  So we know it has to be all five because there's only five spaces.
[851.34s -> 856.82s]  By the way, if you see a space between the numbers, there has to be at least one cube
[856.82s -> 859.90s]  of free space between these two numbers.
[859.90s -> 863.70s]  So for instance, I'm not going to do it, but here and here, right?
[863.70s -> 867.86s]  There has to be at least one space between these two numbers going down.
[867.86s -> 868.86s]  Here's your explanation.
[869.06s -> 880.10s]  If you don't understand it, read a fucking book.
[880.10s -> 882.50s]  It wasn't 35 seconds.
[882.50s -> 888.63s]  We're relaxing today.
[888.63s -> 891.61s]  Was it 30 seconds?
[891.61s -> 894.53s]  Which book?
[894.53s -> 895.76s]  I don't know.
[895.76s -> 907.98s]  What was the last book you guys read?
[907.98s -> 909.18s]  Well, we know it can't be...
[909.18s -> 912.38s]  And by the way, this is very important.
[912.38s -> 913.38s]  Two can't be over here.
[913.38s -> 915.18s]  It has to be sequential.
[915.18s -> 916.18s]  So this is the one.
[916.18s -> 917.58s]  There has to be a space, which is here.
[917.58s -> 920.18s]  So therefore, there needs to...
[920.18s -> 921.38s]  The two is here.
[921.38s -> 924.94s]  That's how it works.
[924.94s -> 926.74s]  You read the Bible the last book is you read.
[926.74s -> 930.38s]  Okay.
[930.38s -> 936.60s]  All right.
[936.60s -> 936.80s]  All right.
[936.80s -> 937.20s]  New artwork.
[937.20s -> 938.76s]  What is it?
[938.76s -> 938.96s]  I don't know.
[938.96s -> 939.76s]  What are these pictures?
[939.76s -> 943.13s]  I'm not even looking at the pictures.
[943.13s -> 948.88s]  Okay.
[948.88s -> 950.64s]  What's your favorite book?
[950.64s -> 952.64s]  I actually haven't read a book in a long time.
[952.64s -> 955.69s]  Bad.
[955.69s -> 956.29s]  Although I don't know.
[956.29s -> 958.13s]  I've...
[958.13s -> 960.56s]  I have read...
[960.56s -> 963.56s]  I think the world has completely changed in a way.
[963.56s -> 966.33s]  What I mean by that is...
[966.33s -> 972.18s]  So there's a lot of information you can read online.
[972.18s -> 976.78s]  There's a ton of articles and news programs.
[976.78s -> 980.58s]  And there's a lot of reading that you do on a regular basis.
[980.58s -> 982.42s]  That's not out of a book.
[982.42s -> 986.36s]  So you are still reading.
[986.36s -> 987.56s]  You're not necessarily...
[987.56s -> 991.62s]  I mean, I don't necessarily read novels anymore, right?
[991.62s -> 992.22s]  I don't really...
[992.22s -> 993.82s]  Not that I can remember.
[993.82s -> 1002.44s]  But I do a lot of reading.
[1002.44s -> 1007.71s]  Yeah, the five by fives are always very easy.
[1007.71s -> 1012.58s]  When can I unlock new songs?
[1012.58s -> 1014.68s]  Reddit doesn't count.
[1014.68s -> 1015.48s]  No, I'm not...
[1015.48s -> 1016.48s]  Look.
[1016.48s -> 1020.28s]  I'm just saying that you do read a lot on a daily basis.
[1020.28s -> 1029.15s]  It's not necessarily a novel, but you are reading a lot.
[1029.15s -> 1029.75s]  Okay.
[1029.75s -> 1030.55s]  How many...
[1030.55s -> 1031.35s]  Oh, there's a whole...
[1031.35s -> 1031.95s]  Oh, level one.
[1031.95s -> 1033.55s]  Level two.
[1033.55s -> 1034.35s]  What else is here in level...
[1034.35s -> 1034.75s]  All right.
[1034.75s -> 1035.35s]  So we're going to...
[1035.35s -> 1042.33s]  I'll get through these quick.
[1042.33s -> 1043.33s]  Can you lower the sound effects?
[1043.33s -> 1049.18s]  Are they loud?
[1049.18s -> 1050.38s]  Sounds too loud?
[1050.38s -> 1051.58s]  Turn the music up and the sound down?
[1051.58s -> 1053.74s]  Is that what you want?
[1053.74s -> 1062.55s]  Because I can do that.
[1062.55s -> 1064.90s]  Music's a little loud.
[1064.90s -> 1069.74s]  Is that a little better?
[1069.74s -> 1070.54s]  Music's too loud?
[1070.54s -> 1072.31s]  Is that better?
[1072.31s -> 1076.58s]  I think we're in a good spot, right?
[1076.58s -> 1077.78s]  There's special puzzles, too.
[1077.78s -> 1078.18s]  All right.
[1078.18s -> 1080.18s]  Let me get some money so we can make some...
[1080.18s -> 1085.14s]  Unlock some stuff.
[1085.14s -> 1085.34s]  All right.
[1085.34s -> 1085.74s]  Let's see.
[1085.74s -> 1089.54s]  So remember, this is where it gets interesting because obviously one, two, three, it could be there.
[1089.54s -> 1090.94s]  It could also be one, two, three.
[1090.94s -> 1093.96s]  Therefore, what have we deduced, everybody?
[1093.96s -> 1099.95s]  If it has to be three going this way and there's only five spaces, what have we deduced?
[1099.95s -> 1102.90s]  Exactly.
[1102.90s -> 1105.10s]  Nice work.
[1105.10s -> 1106.90s]  And again, what...
[1106.90s -> 1109.14s]  Guys, what can we deduce from this row?
[1109.14s -> 1110.34s]  It has to be a space in the middle.
[1110.34s -> 1113.08s]  How can we deduce it?
[1113.08s -> 1113.88s]  What do you think?
[1113.88s -> 1120.13s]  I mean, what do I have to deduce this from?
[1120.13s -> 1121.93s]  One, space, then three.
[1121.93s -> 1122.73s]  You get it now.
[1122.73s -> 1125.58s]  You guys get it.
[1125.58s -> 1130.38s]  By the way, Picross is probably one of the most relaxing fun games I've ever played.
[1130.38s -> 1135.38s]  There are a hundred million versions of what you are seeing on the screen.
[1135.38s -> 1136.98s]  It's on every app store.
[1136.98s -> 1138.78s]  It's on every single device.
[1138.78s -> 1140.18s]  You can find it.
[1140.18s -> 1141.18s]  It's a lot.
[1141.18s -> 1142.98s]  So if you like this, you go, oh, well, this is cool.
[1142.98s -> 1144.98s]  I wish I had like a hundred billion puzzles to do.
[1144.98s -> 1147.58s]  They exist.
[1147.58s -> 1147.78s]  All right.
[1147.78s -> 1149.78s]  So what have we deduced here?
[1149.78s -> 1151.58s]  Here's what we've deduced here.
[1151.58s -> 1155.62s]  I actually want to do that because this is physically not possible.
[1155.62s -> 1162.02s]  If we know these two are here and this is a three in this in this down and up and down.
[1162.02s -> 1164.22s]  It cannot possibly be here.
[1164.22s -> 1164.62s]  You guys get it.
[1164.62s -> 1166.50s]  You understand?
[1166.50s -> 1167.30s]  No one's too dumb.
[1167.30s -> 1179.46s]  No one's dumb enough to not know this.
[1179.46s -> 1180.70s]  Okay.
[1180.70s -> 1184.42s]  Okay.
[1184.42s -> 1189.66s]  That was pretty good deduction right there.
[1189.66s -> 1190.26s]  All right. So this is three.
[1190.26s -> 1194.70s]  And there it is.
[1194.70s -> 1195.70s]  What the deuce?
[1195.70s -> 1199.19s]  Why did you just say that?
[1199.19s -> 1202.78s]  You guys want me to look at every picture that comes up?
[1202.78s -> 1212.54s]  Or should we just wait and just go through the gallery later?
[1212.54s -> 1212.94s]  Please.
[1212.94s -> 1213.34s]  God.
[1213.34s -> 1217.01s]  No.
[1217.01s -> 1223.28s]  I think you're the only person that said that.
[1223.28s -> 1225.06s]  There were.
[1225.06s -> 1225.66s]  It's okay.
[1225.66s -> 1227.46s]  This chat moves pretty fast, right?
[1227.46s -> 1230.06s]  It's hard sometimes to pick up what everybody's saying.
[1230.06s -> 1236.26s]  But that was I think three nos and every single other person said yes.
[1236.26s -> 1238.66s]  I kind of feel bad for the people that said no.
[1238.66s -> 1240.06s]  It's like shit.
[1240.06s -> 1244.66s]  There's like 96 percent majority that said they want to see this.
[1244.66s -> 1254.83s]  Okay, cool.
[1254.83s -> 1257.99s]  I feel bad for them having no taste.
[1257.99s -> 1260.56s]  Well, I mean, come on.
[1260.56s -> 1266.10s]  This is going to be a quick one.
[1266.10s -> 1266.70s]  That's a world record.
[1266.70s -> 1271.54s]  I think that puzzle that might be the world record because I might be one of them.
[1271.54s -> 1274.34s]  I don't know how many people played that level and went that fast.
[1274.34s -> 1283.22s]  I probably in the top 20.
[1283.22s -> 1293.26s]  I love these mini cans.
[1293.26s -> 1297.37s]  What is it?
[1297.37s -> 1302.41s]  Pog Pog Pog.
[1302.41s -> 1308.05s]  You guys like this character?
[1308.05s -> 1314.91s]  The little cans are great because so the bit I don't like drinking an entire huge soda
[1314.91s -> 1317.11s]  unless I don't know why this is the way this is.
[1317.11s -> 1318.71s]  But let's go over this.
[1318.71s -> 1320.91s]  Oh, it just got absolutely real.
[1320.91s -> 1324.11s]  By the way, this is now real.
[1324.11s -> 1325.31s]  Those were little warm up rounds.
[1325.31s -> 1328.31s]  But now is where you have to really start to pay attention.
[1328.31s -> 1335.31s]  Some of these hit cross games can get to be 25 20 by 20 50 by 50 sometimes.
[1335.31s -> 1339.10s]  They get they get kind of crazy.
[1339.10s -> 1340.60s]  But anyway, so look at this.
[1340.60s -> 1341.50s]  Look at how difficult this is.
[1341.50s -> 1342.50s]  So there's a two down here.
[1342.50s -> 1346.10s]  But where where the heck would that be?
[1346.10s -> 1348.85s]  A little bit of deduction.
[1348.85s -> 1349.25s]  How many was it?
[1349.25s -> 1349.65s]  What is it?
[1349.65s -> 1350.85s]  10 by 10.
[1350.85s -> 1352.45s]  So this is 10 by 10.
[1352.45s -> 1353.65s]  So take a look at this.
[1353.65s -> 1354.65s]  This is very interesting.
[1354.65s -> 1355.65s]  This dream is so funny.
[1355.65s -> 1356.65s]  It's like you're showing your grant.
[1356.65s -> 1357.89s]  What are you saying?
[1357.89s -> 1363.38s]  Like you're showing your grandkids anime that you don't understand.
[1363.38s -> 1365.58s]  Reduce this.
[1365.58s -> 1369.56s]  Wait, I'm showing my grandkids anime that I don't understand.
[1369.56s -> 1371.46s]  What does that mean?
[1371.46s -> 1374.66s]  I understand half of this because it's Picross.
[1374.66s -> 1376.26s]  So I can tell you about the Picross part.
[1376.26s -> 1384.93s]  I can't tell you about all the Miku characters, dude.
[1384.93s -> 1389.06s]  Okay, my grandmother one time.
[1389.06s -> 1390.26s]  My grandmother.
[1390.26s -> 1399.42s]  She she bought a hat one time and she bought this hat and she wore this hat all the time.
[1399.42s -> 1403.71s]  It was kind of one of those hats as a flip hat where it's got all the way around.
[1403.71s -> 1407.29s]  It was like not a beanie, but has like a brim on it.
[1407.29s -> 1413.10s]  So she wore this hat all the time and she didn't know what was on it.
[1413.10s -> 1419.70s]  She didn't know what was on the hat and what was on the front as a graphic.
[1419.90s -> 1421.10s]  A bucket hat, yeah.
[1421.10s -> 1426.52s]  So on the front of this hat was a graphic of the four South Park kids.
[1426.52s -> 1428.52s]  She had no idea what they were.
[1428.52s -> 1432.32s]  She thought they were just four cute young cute boys.
[1432.32s -> 1434.52s]  Like she just thought it was like kids.
[1434.52s -> 1437.34s]  She did not know that they were the South Park kids.
[1437.34s -> 1442.47s]  So that was kind of endearing.
[1442.47s -> 1450.53s]  And I feel like I'm am I doing that right now?
[1450.53s -> 1453.73s]  And it'd be like, oh grandma, you know, that's from a TV show.
[1453.73s -> 1457.13s]  Oh, the TV show with the four young cute young boys.
[1457.13s -> 1458.73s]  Yes, of course. I know that one.
[1458.73s -> 1463.80s]  Yeah, it was and she wore it all the time.
[1463.80s -> 1470.16s]  Did you deduce that? You should have.
[1470.16s -> 1476.36s]  Like she saw them as like little grandkids, not as kind of crass television.
[1476.36s -> 1479.50s]  OK, so here's what happened. Let's deduce it.
[1479.50s -> 1481.70s]  So what we've done here, you're probably wondering.
[1481.70s -> 1486.10s]  Jerma, I mean, you're so smart and everything you say so intelligent.
[1486.10s -> 1488.01s]  Help me. I'm having trouble.
[1488.01s -> 1490.67s]  So we filled in almost the whole bottom row.
[1490.67s -> 1491.57s]  What can we do now?
[1491.57s -> 1495.23s]  We now that this see the two and the seven at the top.
[1495.23s -> 1498.13s]  This is guaranteed to be these seven.
[1498.13s -> 1500.23s]  So all we have to do this. I love when this happens.
[1500.23s -> 1504.23s]  It's so much fun. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[1504.23s -> 1507.32s]  And look what we've done over here.
[1507.32s -> 1510.79s]  We have deduced so much. Stop explaining.
[1510.79s -> 1517.19s]  I beg you. Your brain, your monkey brain takes too long.
[1517.19s -> 1519.77s]  That's not you're not chilling out, man.
[1519.77s -> 1521.87s]  Shut up. Shut up. You're an idiot.
[1521.87s -> 1523.47s]  This is not I don't see anybody chilling here.
[1523.47s -> 1525.57s]  I see people being rude.
[1525.57s -> 1528.70s]  It's supposed to be a chilling out time.
[1528.70s -> 1535.46s]  All right, so let's go.
[1535.46s -> 1543.27s]  Remember that? OK, no more explaining.
[1543.27s -> 1546.99s]  Actually, that sound kind of is annoying, isn't it?
[1546.99s -> 1548.19s]  Yes, that's the hat.
[1548.19s -> 1549.69s]  Somebody in sub streams put it up.
[1549.69s -> 1553.40s]  That's the hat. It's in sub stream right now.
[1553.40s -> 1560.14s]  That is the exact hat that my grandmother wore for years.
[1560.14s -> 1561.34s]  Yeah. OK, I'm going to turn this sound.
[1561.34s -> 1565.76s]  I'm going to turn the sound off. I don't like it after this one.
[1565.76s -> 1568.30s]  All right. So let's get going.
[1568.30s -> 1575.25s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Two.
[1575.25s -> 1576.55s]  Cool that it fills that in automatically.
[1576.55s -> 1582.06s]  A lot of these games don't do that.
[1582.06s -> 1584.55s]  Perfect chill time. I actually don't.
[1585.55s -> 1590.74s]  Please explain to us.
[1590.74s -> 1594.84s]  Why are you treating why are you treating this like Citizen Kane?
[1594.84s -> 1602.14s]  I'm trying to figure out what that what that person means.
[1602.14s -> 1603.44s]  I'm treating this.
[1603.44s -> 1610.63s]  Somebody said I'm treating this little Sudoku puzzle like Citizen Kane.
[1610.63s -> 1612.03s]  What does that mean?
[1612.03s -> 1639.49s]  I just don't I just don't understand.
[1639.49s -> 1640.29s]  Here's the tricky part.
[1640.29s -> 1642.89s]  So this is going to go this way that way.
[1642.89s -> 1648.74s]  Oh, that goes to part of the five.
[1648.84s -> 1654.70s]  That's the one playing pick across alongside you.
[1654.70s -> 1656.90s]  Oh, let's see.
[1656.90s -> 1666.70s]  One, two, face one, two, three, four, five.
[1666.70s -> 1670.52s]  So what is this picture?
[1670.52s -> 1676.49s]  A dove. Oh, we got some artwork.
[1676.49s -> 1677.79s]  I didn't even talk about the little cans.
[1677.79s -> 1687.95s]  OK, so the little cans are the perfect size because how many ounces is it?
[1687.95s -> 1690.60s]  Let's see. Seven and a half ounces.
[1690.60s -> 1693.52s]  So it's almost eight ounces.
[1693.52s -> 1698.75s]  You get a big thing ice and you can just keep pouring this
[1698.75s -> 1701.15s]  in and pretend like you're drinking a full can.
[1701.15s -> 1706.46s]  So it's easy to hold.
[1706.46s -> 1707.96s]  I like it small.
[1707.96s -> 1720.33s]  I think I'll be able to clear this whole first and second page in the next like 20 minutes.
[1720.33s -> 1721.63s]  All right. This time, I'm not going to say anything.
[1721.63s -> 1726.43s]  It's up to you to deduce this because I'm just going to do it without your help.
[1726.43s -> 1728.23s]  I might need it eventually, but whatever.
[1728.23s -> 1797.82s]  I think I can get this. I think I can get it.
[1797.82s -> 1800.82s]  OK, let's just assume this is the first one, which it is because it's telling me.
[1800.82s -> 1801.92s]  So that's one.
[1801.92s -> 1804.52s]  Let's say it's the other one is right here next to it.
[1804.62s -> 1808.29s]  That means I think this is what that means.
[1808.29s -> 1811.04s]  And that is exactly what it means.
[1811.04s -> 1818.69s]  OK, that's the is this the second?
[1818.69s -> 1821.09s]  So this is the second one.
[1821.09s -> 1823.69s]  That means this has to be here.
[1823.69s -> 1826.82s]  The other one is right here.
[1826.82s -> 1841.43s]  Take what else is that helping with one or one?
[1841.43s -> 1843.36s]  That's one.
[1843.36s -> 1846.02s]  And then it's three.
[1846.02s -> 1851.06s]  So this game actually helps a lot because what's you know, it's what's happening.
[1851.06s -> 1855.16s]  A lot of the a lot of pick cross games don't do this.
[1855.16s -> 1857.96s]  It won't see on the left here next down here.
[1857.96s -> 1859.36s]  See down here.
[1859.36s -> 1862.86s]  That one being grayed out is telling me this is that one.
[1862.86s -> 1864.16s]  A lot of them don't do that.
[1864.16s -> 1870.04s]  So this actually is a lot easier than a lot of typical pick cross games.
[1870.04s -> 1871.84s]  So that's it's cool.
[1871.84s -> 1873.84s]  So I know that this is the first one.
[1873.84s -> 1878.54s]  That means that these nothing else can be over here.
[1878.54s -> 1892.66s]  So now I want to know.
[1892.66s -> 1894.86s]  I don't know if this is part of the two part of the four.
[1894.86s -> 1897.23s]  I don't know that yet.
[1897.23s -> 1898.53s]  My cousin could beat your ass.
[1898.53s -> 1898.83s]  All right.
[1898.83s -> 1908.99s]  Well, that's that's fine.
[1908.99s -> 1916.12s]  Don't be true.
[1916.12s -> 1917.02s]  So this is the one.
[1917.02s -> 1935.52s]  So that's really that's really good to know comfy.
[1935.52s -> 1942.58s]  Yeah, good guys.
[1942.58s -> 1948.79s]  Wicked handsome.
[1948.79s -> 1951.49s]  Okay, I'm being distracted.
[1951.49s -> 1954.53s]  So this is three.
[1954.53s -> 1967.50s]  This is the one and there's two three, four, five, six.
[1967.50s -> 1969.80s]  That's two.
[1969.80s -> 1975.40s]  Very nice.
[1975.40s -> 1986.12s]  Almost there.
[1986.12s -> 1991.10s]  Nice.
[1991.10s -> 1992.70s]  Wait, what'd you say?
[1992.70s -> 1994.37s]  Somebody said something here.
[1994.37s -> 1996.60s]  This is important.
[1996.60s -> 1998.10s]  Would you say something you asked?
[1998.10s -> 2002.69s]  We talked about this.
[2002.69s -> 2003.79s]  What the hell is you just right?
[2003.79s -> 2009.09s]  It was about how you okay, I asked an NPC in a dream for an invention idea
[2009.09s -> 2013.11s]  and she said something to me, but I forgot telling you.
[2013.11s -> 2017.09s]  You have to be make sure you get up and write it down.
[2017.09s -> 2017.99s]  Something about your dream.
[2017.99s -> 2020.69s]  We let's go over it one more time very briefly.
[2020.69s -> 2021.79s]  If you are in a dream.
[2021.79s -> 2024.98s]  Have you ever noticed that when you're in a dream?
[2024.98s -> 2031.25s]  Oh Christmas tree when you're in a dream people if you if you ask certain people
[2031.25s -> 2033.95s]  in your dreams about stuff, it will give you such unbelievable.
[2033.95s -> 2034.55s]  Oh my God.
[2034.55s -> 2035.45s]  I completely forgot about this.
[2035.45s -> 2039.30s]  Let me read this.
[2039.30s -> 2041.60s]  Okay, so I was a little high.
[2041.60s -> 2045.74s]  This is that this is out of absolutely nowhere, but I'm going to read this.
[2045.74s -> 2053.40s]  So I was kind of high and I wrote something that I think is unbelievably profound.
[2053.40s -> 2060.48s]  I remember just being like high sitting on the couch and going I have to write this now.
[2060.48s -> 2061.98s]  So I wrote this down.
[2061.98s -> 2067.08s]  This is I was a little bit high and I wrote this and I think it's incredibly profound.
[2067.08s -> 2070.34s]  So let me read it to you.
[2070.34s -> 2073.54s]  And this you might think this is coming out of nowhere, but it's it just kind of popped
[2073.54s -> 2077.64s]  in my head like oh like when you don't ever watch like for instance,
[2077.64s -> 2082.94s]  like some of the old videos that I have, you know back in like the TF2 era or back in whatever era,
[2082.94s -> 2086.74s]  you know, if you see like an old picture of you or something you like wow, look at that person.
[2086.74s -> 2088.44s]  Here it is.
[2088.44s -> 2095.40s]  This is about the preservation of audio and video preservation of audio and video.
[2095.40s -> 2099.31s]  Okay, and photos.
[2099.31s -> 2100.81s]  I haven't read this in a while.
[2100.81s -> 2104.21s]  So it's been like it's been like a week or so.
[2104.21s -> 2111.59s]  So I don't know how fucking stupid this might be, but I'm just going to go for it.
[2111.59s -> 2117.29s]  I feel like I'm going to give like a class presentation.
[2117.29s -> 2120.50s]  I think the Miku sound out of my ear.
[2120.50s -> 2126.39s]  Okay, preserving video and audio is slightly uncomfortable
[2126.39s -> 2131.19s]  because it's like time traveling to confront or combat your past self.
[2131.19s -> 2135.49s]  Needing to revisit almost a different person who no longer exists.
[2135.49s -> 2139.39s]  You aren't the you from before and you can feel it.
[2139.39s -> 2143.29s]  Your memories almost clash into each other when you think or see back,
[2143.29s -> 2148.19s]  almost like two different people's feelings agreeing and disagreeing at the same time.
[2148.19s -> 2151.49s]  You are the same, but that person doesn't exist.
[2151.49s -> 2154.49s]  It only exists because it lives in your brain.
[2154.49s -> 2156.39s]  That person will never exist again.
[2156.39s -> 2159.39s]  It's only a fleeting part of your mind.
[2159.39s -> 2162.69s]  And your accounts are all you have.
[2162.69s -> 2176.02s]  Memories turn into well-acted plays that you yourself start becoming the audience for.
[2176.02s -> 2183.68s]  What about that?
[2183.68s -> 2190.64s]  Did I read all the live tweeting of Poopy Halloween I did?
[2190.64s -> 2193.40s]  Vsauce made that video already?
[2193.40s -> 2198.80s]  Oh, whatever.
[2198.80s -> 2201.10s]  All right.
[2201.10s -> 2203.74s]  Let me see.
[2203.74s -> 2206.44s]  Oh, this, I also wrote this really high and this is wicked funny.
[2206.44s -> 2206.94s]  All right, ready?
[2206.94s -> 2207.44s]  I wrote this high.
[2207.44s -> 2210.14s]  I always try to keep track of things I'm saying.
[2210.14s -> 2211.74s]  So when I was high, this is like a few weeks ago.
[2211.74s -> 2214.44s]  I had another, I had a million-dollar idea and you guys are going to laugh,
[2214.44s -> 2216.94s]  but I don't, maybe you don't.
[2216.94s -> 2219.43s]  Million-dollar idea.
[2219.43s -> 2225.53s]  Fruit sweatshirts slash hoodies slash merch line with solid colors
[2225.53s -> 2229.33s]  and matching fruit patch of same color.
[2229.33s -> 2239.30s]  Banana slash bright yellow, strawberry slash bright red.
[2239.30s -> 2247.56s]  Like, wow, that sounds fucking actually pretty sick.
[2247.56s -> 2250.80s]  Okay, what else we got?
[2250.80s -> 2254.00s]  There's all the Hubby Halloween stuff.
[2254.00s -> 2256.47s]  Okay, so yeah, let me go over this.
[2256.47s -> 2262.08s]  I watched Hubby Halloween, the Adam Sandler movie.
[2262.08s -> 2263.28s]  And let me go over it.
[2263.28s -> 2267.11s]  I live tweeted the whole thing, but I never, I never tweeted it.
[2267.11s -> 2269.03s]  Do you want me to do the whole thing?
[2269.03s -> 2273.78s]  You want me to do the whole thing?
[2273.78s -> 2276.48s]  It's like, it's like two pages.
[2276.48s -> 2281.74s]  Okay, let's start.
[2281.74s -> 2293.95s]  So, let's start.
[2293.95s -> 2298.93s]  So this is the entire Hubby Halloween movie from start to finish.
[2298.93s -> 2304.13s]  I wrote just my thoughts on it as the movie went on.
[2304.13s -> 2308.68s]  Mute the music.
[2308.68s -> 2311.38s]  I'm watching Hubby Halloween.
[2311.38s -> 2315.28s]  I don't know what this movie is about or who the fuck this guy is.
[2315.28s -> 2317.86s]  It's been 40 minutes.
[2317.86s -> 2319.96s]  Why is he walking around a high school dance?
[2319.96s -> 2323.45s]  Why is this guy in the movie?
[2323.45s -> 2326.15s]  Why are they all so fucking mean to this guy?
[2326.15s -> 2328.63s]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[2328.63s -> 2331.53s]  He has a magic superhero thermos.
[2331.53s -> 2334.23s]  He can throw it like Captain America's shield.
[2334.23s -> 2336.13s]  It can turn into anything.
[2336.13s -> 2339.33s]  Literally any object he needs in that current scene.
[2339.33s -> 2342.42s]  Is he a superhero?
[2342.42s -> 2344.36s]  It just made him food.
[2344.36s -> 2346.66s]  I think that's what was implied.
[2346.66s -> 2351.92s]  He poured a bunch of food into it and it made a smoothie.
[2351.92s -> 2353.69s]  Okay.
[2353.69s -> 2356.79s]  And then that's when I stopped doing draft tweets and I went to my notes.
[2356.79s -> 2367.28s]  Okay, and then it goes here.
[2367.28s -> 2369.10s]  Okay, here we go.
[2369.10s -> 2372.18s]  Wait, why are they on a scary road now?
[2372.28s -> 2375.88s]  Someone just threw a trash can at him while he was on his bike.
[2375.88s -> 2377.58s]  They are trying to kill him.
[2377.58s -> 2381.99s]  People are trying to fucking kill this guy.
[2381.99s -> 2384.49s]  This is major spoilers, by the way.
[2384.49s -> 2387.69s]  Why do we care that Walter is a werewolf?
[2387.69s -> 2389.19s]  Who is Walter?
[2389.19s -> 2392.86s]  Who is this other guy?
[2392.86s -> 2395.26s]  There are missing kids?
[2395.26s -> 2397.76s]  Wait, where was Hubby last seen?
[2397.76s -> 2399.46s]  I don't remember.
[2399.46s -> 2401.53s]  Were these kids with him?
[2401.53s -> 2405.23s]  He's not related to these people and he's shitting in their house.
[2405.23s -> 2410.24s]  He didn't wipe his ass and he waddled off the toilet.
[2410.24s -> 2413.54s]  A dog just ate his own shit on camera.
[2413.54s -> 2414.34s]  I'm serious.
[2414.34s -> 2417.31s]  That's what I just watched.
[2417.31s -> 2423.14s]  The dog is evil or was that the Walter guy?
[2423.14s -> 2425.24s]  What was the grenade?
[2425.24s -> 2434.09s]  He doesn't know he's in a haunted house and macing people.
[2434.09s -> 2436.89s]  Who is Paul Blart's character a parody of?
[2436.89s -> 2439.39s]  It seems like they want to tell you so bad.
[2439.39s -> 2444.78s]  It's really heavy-handed and I don't know.
[2444.78s -> 2447.48s]  They are pissing their clothes and they got caught.
[2447.48s -> 2448.78s]  The werewolf?
[2448.78s -> 2454.08s]  And the other guy, they're peeing their pants on a bench.
[2454.08s -> 2456.76s]  The world's going crazy now.
[2456.76s -> 2458.92s]  People are throwing rocks at him.
[2458.92s -> 2465.26s]  Shaq is now the narrator of the movie, but it's someone dubbing Shaq's voice.
[2465.26s -> 2468.16s]  Shaq is now a major character in the movie.
[2468.16s -> 2474.38s]  His wife's voice is dubbed too.
[2474.38s -> 2477.98s]  The police are doing a sting operation with Hubby.
[2477.98s -> 2481.55s]  They're trying to catch his high school crush?
[2481.55s -> 2483.97s]  The school crush is a demon?
[2483.97s -> 2485.57s]  They loved each other all along?
[2485.57s -> 2492.76s]  The killer is in the house.
[2492.76s -> 2495.24s]  Spoilers by the way, I'm serious.
[2495.24s -> 2497.50s]  Mom is the killer?
[2497.50s -> 2498.80s]  Are they all outside?
[2498.80s -> 2500.84s]  They're all, no one is dead.
[2500.84s -> 2502.34s]  She's pouring gasoline on them.
[2502.34s -> 2503.74s]  Just take the gas can away.
[2503.74s -> 2505.14s]  What the fuck, she's like 90.
[2505.14s -> 2507.04s]  It's, just get it.
[2507.04s -> 2509.70s]  He's contemplating letting them burn.
[2509.70s -> 2510.90s]  They were apparently bullies?
[2510.90s -> 2515.59s]  This whole scene was on TV?
[2515.59s -> 2518.99s]  Everyone just laughed and said there is no reason at all to dislike him.
[2518.99s -> 2521.02s]  They're laughing about it.
[2521.02s -> 2523.12s]  The whole cast is saying sorry.
[2524.12s -> 2527.40s]  And what about the werewolf?
[2527.40s -> 2529.56s]  Why were they trying to hurt him?
[2529.56s -> 2533.41s]  Like trying to hurt him, it was just no reason.
[2533.41s -> 2540.12s]  Mom is explaining how to be nicer to people and disappeared into the woods?
[2540.12s -> 2542.52s]  All these guys watch is Hubby.
[2542.52s -> 2543.22s]  Is this a joke?
[2543.22s -> 2545.62s]  She's acting like it's a prank.
[2545.62s -> 2547.12s]  He makes gadgets, like I don't get it.
[2547.12s -> 2553.54s]  He had super powers from Salem?
[2553.54s -> 2556.64s]  It is now a screaming compilation at the end.
[2556.64s -> 2558.74s]  Ha ha ha ha dude, I'm dying.
[2558.74s -> 2566.94s]  It's like I'm watching a YouTube compilation of Sandler screaming.
[2566.94s -> 2571.57s]  That's all I wrote.
[2571.57s -> 2579.69s]  The movie was crazy.
[2579.69s -> 2581.19s]  That movie was out of control.
[2581.19s -> 2586.39s]  I remember as I was watching it, I was like, I don't, I was also a little high.
[2586.39s -> 2593.74s]  I think you're noticing a theme here.
[2593.74s -> 2598.17s]  Honestly, if you watch Hubby Halloween, you're going to sit there and be like,
[2598.17s -> 2601.72s]  what is going on here?
[2601.72s -> 2606.90s]  What is happening right now?
[2606.90s -> 2610.16s]  You were not a little high.
[2610.16s -> 2612.06s]  The movie is just, it's just crazy.
[2612.06s -> 2625.60s]  It's just crazy stuff happening.
[2625.60s -> 2634.07s]  The sound effects volume, I'm sorry.
[2634.07s -> 2635.67s]  Imagine if the TV was turned off.
[2635.67s -> 2639.27s]  No, no, I'm telling you, if you go back and watch Hubby Halloween,
[2639.27s -> 2646.65s]  you're just simply going to go, wait, all the stuff he said like happens in this movie.
[2646.65s -> 2650.35s]  There's a part, I'm not kidding, there's a part where a dog is just eating his own shit.
[2650.35s -> 2653.06s]  And it's like, what's going on?
[2653.06s -> 2654.76s]  Why is this dog doing this?
[2654.76s -> 2663.26s]  It was just like, what's happening?
[2663.26s -> 2666.84s]  It was all right.
[2666.84s -> 2667.54s]  I did watch it.
[2667.54s -> 2678.56s]  I wasn't high.
[2678.56s -> 2679.86s]  Everybody relax.
[2679.86s -> 2689.70s]  Turn the sound effects down.
[2689.70s -> 2690.70s]  Was it a dream journal?
[2690.70s -> 2693.82s]  No, I just, I was kind of high and I was,
[2693.92s -> 2695.22s]  like it was like Halloween time.
[2695.22s -> 2700.88s]  I'm like, I'll only put it on.
[2700.88s -> 2701.98s]  Is that better?
[2701.98s -> 2703.38s]  Just having no sound?
[2703.38s -> 2708.52s]  Let's see.
[2708.52s -> 2711.88s]  It might be better.
[2711.88s -> 2714.08s]  Is that your zonked journal?
[2714.08s -> 2716.95s]  Yeah, it kind of is.
[2716.95s -> 2717.65s]  There you go.
[2717.65s -> 2721.98s]  There's like the last few times I've been a little high
[2721.98s -> 2725.48s]  and I just write stuff down and I just wrote down like a whole Vsauce video.
[2725.48s -> 2728.38s]  Well, I thought I was being so profound.
[2728.38s -> 2732.39s]  I remember sitting there looking at that and just being like,
[2732.39s -> 2737.32s]  this is like potentially like Nobel Prize winning shit.
[2737.32s -> 2744.97s]  Turned out it was just a Vsauce video.
[2744.97s -> 2753.33s]  Okay, this one's going to be hard.
[2753.33s -> 2754.23s]  What should I do first here?
[2754.23s -> 2759.60s]  3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[2759.60s -> 2762.19s]  I don't know.
[2762.19s -> 2764.09s]  5, 6, 7, 8.
[2764.09s -> 2768.85s]  What can I start with?
[2768.85s -> 2769.65s]  Maybe the 5.
[2769.65s -> 2771.15s]  Let's see.
[2771.15s -> 2775.58s]  3, 4, 5, space, 1, 2.
[2775.58s -> 2777.78s]  Really, what can I deduce here?
[2777.78s -> 2779.18s]  4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[2779.18s -> 2788.58s]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[2788.58s -> 2792.54s]  Because if, let's see, if it was like this,
[2792.54s -> 2794.24s]  it was like boom, boom.
[2794.24s -> 2796.34s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2796.34s -> 2800.64s]  That would mean that this would have to be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[2800.64s -> 2802.54s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[2802.54s -> 2803.74s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[2803.74s -> 2806.04s]  So it has to be here, one of these.
[2806.04s -> 2811.02s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[2811.02s -> 2811.72s]  3, 4.
[2811.72s -> 2817.51s]  So by deduction, it has to be these two and it is.
[2817.51s -> 2824.31s]  That doesn't help though.
[2824.31s -> 2825.71s]  Chest level gameplay.
[2825.71s -> 2827.95s]  We're just chilling out today.
[2827.95s -> 2829.25s]  I read you some more drafts.
[2829.25s -> 2840.22s]  There, aren't you happy?
[2840.22s -> 2841.02s]  Let me see.
[2841.02s -> 2842.92s]  I'm going to, I'm going to go for it.
[2842.92s -> 2844.12s]  It was wrong.
[2844.12s -> 2844.62s]  It was wrong.
[2844.62s -> 2848.01s]  Reset it.
[2848.01s -> 2849.70s]  Okay.
[2849.70s -> 2850.10s]  It's okay.
[2850.10s -> 2853.97s]  I got it now.
[2853.97s -> 2859.68s]  This does help a lot because now this is the 1.
[2859.68s -> 2860.58s]  This is 5.
[2860.58s -> 2863.48s]  So right, if we give a count of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[2863.48s -> 2864.28s]  Boink.
[2864.28s -> 2866.62s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[2866.62s -> 2870.07s]  Cheated.
[2870.07s -> 2870.67s]  That's not cheating.
[2870.67s -> 2873.77s]  That's just deducing by failure.
[2873.77s -> 2878.70s]  I learned from my failure.
[2878.70s -> 2881.00s]  Can't hide the fact that you tore your pants like a barbarian
[2881.00s -> 2882.30s]  because you were too lazy to stand up.
[2882.30s -> 2885.90s]  No, I didn't want to stand up because I, I know.
[2885.90s -> 2887.80s]  There's no reason for me to tell you why.
[2887.80s -> 2889.30s]  I just didn't stand up because I felt like it.
[2889.30s -> 2898.26s]  That's it.
[2898.26s -> 2902.62s]  Okay, 3.
[2902.62s -> 2903.72s]  Well, it can't be here.
[2903.72s -> 2907.70s]  Oh, look what I just did.
[2907.70s -> 2912.32s]  Now it opens up.
[2912.32s -> 2915.58s]  It's that.
[2915.58s -> 2915.88s]  All right.
[2915.88s -> 2919.05s]  This is probably, I think this is all ones though.
[2919.05s -> 2924.65s]  It's annoying.
[2924.65s -> 2927.45s]  1, 2, 3, 4, space 1.
[2927.45s -> 2929.25s]  Let's just assume.
[2929.25s -> 2934.05s]  We can't assume.
[2934.05s -> 2934.75s]  Maybe we can.
[2934.75s -> 2936.45s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[2936.45s -> 2937.35s]  1, 2, 3.
[2937.35s -> 2938.65s]  No, we can.
[2938.65s -> 2940.55s]  So that means that it has to be 1, 2.
[2940.55s -> 2944.48s]  It has to be here and here.
[2944.48s -> 2945.38s]  So we can do that.
[2945.38s -> 2946.48s]  That's correct.
[2946.48s -> 2948.08s]  This is also a 1.
[2948.08s -> 2948.98s]  That's the first one.
[2948.98s -> 2951.74s]  So there you go.
[2951.74s -> 2952.94s]  And there's another one here.
[2952.94s -> 2954.14s]  Okay, so that's 4.
[2954.14s -> 2956.18s]  That's 1, 2, 3, 4.
[2956.18s -> 2956.98s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[2956.98s -> 2957.68s]  We don't know.
[2957.68s -> 2960.09s]  We can't decide that.
[2960.09s -> 2961.49s]  Is everyone relaxing?
[2961.49s -> 2962.39s]  Somebody said this game sucks.
[2962.39s -> 2969.52s]  I want them banned for at least one full minute.
[2969.52s -> 2971.62s]  It's always hard when you have very small numbers
[2971.62s -> 2973.32s]  with large gaps.
[2973.32s -> 2974.92s]  Because this is the 1.
[2974.92s -> 2978.52s]  At some point from here to here is another 1.
[2978.52s -> 2980.92s]  And it's just hard to know where it is.
[2980.92s -> 2983.03s]  I'll get it though.
[2983.03s -> 2984.03s]  All right, so I think I can do this though now.
[2984.03s -> 2985.53s]  So this is 2.
[2985.53s -> 2987.13s]  1, 2, 3, space 1.
[2987.13s -> 2989.41s]  Got it.
[2989.41s -> 2990.51s]  Very cool.
[2990.51s -> 2991.81s]  This is the part of the 3.
[2991.81s -> 2993.61s]  1, 2, 3.
[2993.61s -> 3000.22s]  Can't be here.
[3000.22s -> 3003.41s]  This is 1.
[3003.41s -> 3009.47s]  That's very helpful.
[3009.47s -> 3010.47s]  This is part of the 4.
[3010.47s -> 3013.30s]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[3013.30s -> 3014.84s]  Very nice.
[3014.94s -> 3015.94s]  You're never going to win this game.
[3015.94s -> 3018.39s]  I guarantee you I do.
[3018.39s -> 3020.36s]  I would bet.
[3020.36s -> 3021.66s]  I bet you I complete this level.
[3021.66s -> 3026.10s]  I bet you $100 trillion that I will compete.
[3026.10s -> 3027.80s]  I will beat this level.
[3027.80s -> 3028.60s]  There's no time limit.
[3028.60s -> 3030.50s]  I will just this level will this level right here
[3030.50s -> 3031.80s]  that you're seeing on the screen right now.
[3031.80s -> 3034.10s]  I will finish it.
[3034.10s -> 3037.30s]  It'll do the thing and it'll give us whatever the thing that
[3037.30s -> 3038.10s]  I'm going to finish it.
[3038.10s -> 3038.90s]  But don't worry.
[3038.90s -> 3041.30s]  It's literally impossible for me to not finish this exact
[3041.30s -> 3042.50s]  level right here.
[3042.50s -> 3044.60s]  Nobody's going to nobody's going to like, you know,
[3044.60s -> 3045.80s]  monkey paw me, right?
[3045.80s -> 3046.80s]  It's like this is what I'm telling you.
[3046.80s -> 3048.90s]  I'm telling it's a hundred trillion dollars that I will
[3048.90s -> 3052.10s]  beat this exact screen right here.
[3052.10s -> 3056.80s]  I will beat this this level right now level 1-008 and
[3056.80s -> 3057.50s]  there's no time limit.
[3058.30s -> 3086.22s]  This is part of the 3.
[3086.80s -> 3088.00s]  This is also might be the 3.
[3088.10s -> 3089.10s]  I think that's the 4 right here.
[3099.31s -> 3100.51s]  It's not over.
[3101.11s -> 3101.61s]  No, it's not.
[3101.61s -> 3101.91s]  What do you mean?
[3101.91s -> 3103.01s]  It's not no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3103.01s -> 3104.94s]  Stop that.
[3104.94s -> 3105.54s]  No, you didn't.
[3105.54s -> 3107.34s]  I didn't say I couldn't make any mistakes.
[3107.34s -> 3109.44s]  I just said I was going to complete this level.
[3109.64s -> 3110.24s]  I didn't say it.
[3110.24s -> 3112.24s]  And by the way, there were no mistakes allowed.
[3112.24s -> 3113.04s]  When did I say that?
[3113.04s -> 3114.74s]  That was not but don't curl that monkey paw.
[3114.74s -> 3116.68s]  It's not happening ever.
[3116.68s -> 3117.48s]  This is chill stream.
[3117.88s -> 3119.28s]  I never said it by the way.
[3119.28s -> 3121.68s]  I'm not allowed to make a single purple X.
[3121.68s -> 3126.54s]  No, I just said I'm going to complete the level you get.
[3126.54s -> 3127.64s]  You can talk all the shit you want.
[3127.64s -> 3128.44s]  That's not the case.
[3140.59s -> 3142.23s]  I like the music chill.
[3158.56s -> 3171.24s]  I don't have anything in this role, but it can't be here.
[3171.54s -> 3181.69s]  That's beer all starts coming together now.
[3221.83s -> 3222.63s]  What are you smoking?
[3222.73s -> 3223.53s]  I'm not smoking anything.
[3224.13s -> 3225.83s]  I'm drinking a can of Sprite.
[3231.09s -> 3231.79s]  Big hand.
[3236.48s -> 3238.28s]  Why can't I just drink like a normal person?
[3242.80s -> 3243.20s]  Sprite.
[3243.30s -> 3243.90s]  I like Sprite.
[3246.79s -> 3248.19s]  Sprite's very simple.
[3248.39s -> 3250.79s]  It's very just it's just like a sweet bubbly drink.
[3257.54s -> 3259.14s]  This whole stream is going to be claimed.
[3259.14s -> 3260.84s]  I think like this whole stream is going to be muted.
[3261.64s -> 3264.04s]  So I'm glad you're here chilling out on Thanksgiving Day
[3264.04s -> 3264.54s]  wind down.
[3265.78s -> 3267.18s]  This entire stream is going to get muted.
[3268.60s -> 3269.10s]  Just to let you know.
[3270.78s -> 3273.18s]  Hey, but the thing is though you might not even need sound
[3273.88s -> 3276.28s]  because if you just watch me play the game you see kind of
[3276.28s -> 3277.78s]  my what my deductions and stuff.
[3279.30s -> 3280.10s]  You can still enjoy it.
[3280.70s -> 3282.00s]  Just put on your own soundtrack.
[3287.62s -> 3288.82s]  I do like 7up.
[3290.12s -> 3292.62s]  I like 7up more than Sprite in the flavor department,
[3293.42s -> 3298.66s]  but Sprite is a little lighter, right?
[3299.46s -> 3301.26s]  7up I think is better tasting than Sprite,
[3301.66s -> 3303.26s]  but Sprite is lighter.
[3304.37s -> 3307.27s]  So if you want a lighter drink, you know, that's what I choose.
[3308.84s -> 3309.54s]  That one was simple.
[3309.54s -> 3312.54s]  Now this is going to be really really good for us.
[3313.93s -> 3314.43s]  Very nice.
[3322.37s -> 3323.87s]  Always great when you get this fill in here.
[3325.45s -> 3326.05s]  That's so good.
[3337.10s -> 3339.20s]  You can you do a tier list about this already?
[3340.82s -> 3342.32s]  But Miku?
[3343.92s -> 3347.02s]  I don't I only know like four songs three songs from Miku.
[3351.68s -> 3352.78s]  All right, so let's go.
[3354.83s -> 3355.23s]  It's easy.
[3357.42s -> 3357.92s]  This is eight.
[3358.32s -> 3363.41s]  Yeah, this one.
[3363.41s -> 3364.31s]  Wow, this one was easy.
[3367.94s -> 3368.94s]  It's got to get one.
[3369.54s -> 3370.44s]  Everything is just connected.
[3370.44s -> 3371.24s]  Everything's connected.
[3373.29s -> 3374.19s]  This one was very easy.
[3374.19s -> 3376.31s]  Yeah, necktie.
[3377.90s -> 3379.00s]  We have to check out every single picture.
[3379.00s -> 3379.80s]  That's what was voted on.
[3383.76s -> 3384.56s]  So did tier list.
[3384.56s -> 3385.86s]  I did every one of those already.
[3387.44s -> 3388.54s]  So what a tier list, please.
[3389.14s -> 3390.44s]  I already I did it already.
[3394.14s -> 3395.84s]  You guys want you guys want reruns?
[3396.34s -> 3397.44s]  You want me to do reruns?
[3399.28s -> 3400.88s]  But maybe my tastes have changed.
[3400.88s -> 3401.28s]  It's true.
[3404.59s -> 3405.39s]  Unlock some songs.
[3405.39s -> 3405.79s]  All right.
[3407.82s -> 3408.62s]  Where do I go for that?
[3409.39s -> 3409.69s]  All right.
[3409.69s -> 3412.49s]  So set your favorite characters.
[3412.49s -> 3413.19s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[3418.90s -> 3419.80s]  Who is the characters?
[3421.70s -> 3422.50s]  What character should I have?
[3422.50s -> 3428.06s]  Maybe everyone was talking.
[3428.06s -> 3438.08s]  Everyone was saying this character Luca.
[3441.95s -> 3442.25s]  Okay.
[3443.72s -> 3445.92s]  Puzzles on keyboard.
[3446.22s -> 3448.02s]  How to play credits sound.
[3448.62s -> 3448.92s]  All right.
[3449.12s -> 3449.92s]  How do I unlock songs?
[3453.11s -> 3454.31s]  Special music.
[3454.31s -> 3455.31s]  All right, unlock new songs.
[3455.71s -> 3456.41s]  How much money do I have?
[3456.99s -> 3458.99s]  I have 26 cents.
[3460.10s -> 3460.70s]  How much is this?
[3466.21s -> 3467.21s]  How much does it cost to unlock?
[3468.68s -> 3469.88s]  What song should I unlock?
[3469.88s -> 3471.08s]  I don't know what songs are.
[3474.51s -> 3475.41s]  Do you see anything you like?
[3480.76s -> 3485.96s]  Where's uh, where's that?
[3496.10s -> 3496.60s]  Is it here?
[3497.65s -> 3498.45s]  It's called peep.
[3499.05s -> 3499.85s]  Oh people.
[3500.35s -> 3501.15s]  Oh people.
[3506.86s -> 3507.36s]  Is it here?
[3512.13s -> 3512.73s]  That one.
[3512.83s -> 3515.13s]  I mean, I it's like a five second delay.
[3522.08s -> 3522.48s]  Which one?
[3525.08s -> 3526.58s]  I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do this one.
[3543.41s -> 3543.51s]  All right.
[3543.51s -> 3546.01s]  How about 393 150?
[3552.84s -> 3553.24s]  Shuffle.
[3553.24s -> 3559.58s]  Okay, this one sounds pretty good.
[3567.10s -> 3568.40s]  The butterfly on your shoulder.
[3570.37s -> 3571.07s]  Now it's the chair.
[3573.86s -> 3574.46s]  How about this one?
[3582.63s -> 3583.53s]  I was already laughing.
[3591.28s -> 3592.48s]  I need more stars.
[3592.48s -> 3592.68s]  All right.
[3592.68s -> 3593.48s]  We have it on shuffle.
[3595.15s -> 3595.85s]  We got it on shuffle.
[3603.06s -> 3604.16s]  This is I like this.
[3604.16s -> 3604.86s]  This is relaxed.
[3606.60s -> 3607.30s]  You're 42.
[3607.30s -> 3611.17s]  Not no, I'm not close, but I'm not getting there.
[3612.30s -> 3613.20s]  Wait, why is this playing?
[3619.90s -> 3620.30s]  What?
[3620.50s -> 3620.90s]  Reset it.
[3621.80s -> 3622.20s]  It's eight.
[3622.20s -> 3622.80s]  Oh, it's eight.
[3622.80s -> 3623.00s]  Eight.
[3623.00s -> 3623.40s]  I'm an idiot.
[3630.55s -> 3631.35s]  I went too far down.
[3632.69s -> 3634.59s]  What a fly on your shoulder is the song name.
[3635.23s -> 3639.79s]  Oh, well, I looked over and I see this.
[3640.93s -> 3641.73s]  I was like that.
[3641.83s -> 3642.43s]  What is that?
[3643.03s -> 3645.43s]  Oh, I really genuinely thought you meant that.
[3646.13s -> 3660.53s]  This one should be another easy one.
[3661.69s -> 3662.29s]  I think so.
[3662.39s -> 3662.99s]  Yeah, it will be.
[3662.99s -> 3663.39s]  Look at this.
[3663.89s -> 3664.29s]  Love it.
[3669.74s -> 3670.14s]  Perfect.
[3672.94s -> 3674.44s]  I mean, I want to say it's right here.
[3675.04s -> 3675.74s]  Kind of has to be.
[3696.66s -> 3697.46s]  Okay, so four.
[3698.06s -> 3698.76s]  Very cool.
[3699.76s -> 3700.16s]  Two.
[3700.16s -> 3700.66s]  Nice.
[3700.76s -> 3701.26s]  Four.
[3701.66s -> 3702.16s]  Nice.
[3702.96s -> 3703.36s]  One.
[3704.23s -> 3704.63s]  Nice.
[3705.03s -> 3705.43s]  Three.
[3705.43s -> 3705.83s]  Done.
[3707.93s -> 3709.03s]  This is also a one.
[3709.91s -> 3712.88s]  So it has to be here.
[3714.68s -> 3715.68s]  It's also one.
[3716.38s -> 3717.28s]  It has to be here.
[3719.92s -> 3721.02s]  This is the six.
[3721.02s -> 3725.22s]  So I mean, even if it's one, two, three, four, five, six, it has to be there.
[3727.70s -> 3728.70s]  And it has to be here.
[3728.80s -> 3730.00s]  Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
[3730.00s -> 3731.20s]  I pressed the button a little too much.
[3733.56s -> 3734.96s]  But actually that's fine.
[3734.96s -> 3735.36s]  Okay.
[3748.56s -> 3748.96s]  Nice.
[3750.89s -> 3752.29s]  Jeremy, can you cover yourself in oil?
[3755.31s -> 3756.81s]  Just like all of, what do you...
[3757.94s -> 3758.64s]  Time that person out.
[3759.71s -> 3760.91s]  Time that person out for like five minutes.
[3764.80s -> 3766.50s]  That person needs to be timed out for like five minutes at least.
[3771.44s -> 3772.04s]  When he can.
[3773.45s -> 3774.45s]  I have to go to the settings.
[3774.45s -> 3774.65s]  All right.
[3774.65s -> 3775.15s]  We'll do it or no.
[3777.15s -> 3777.55s]  How you guys doing?
[3777.55s -> 3779.65s]  You guys have a good, uh, I'm gonna say Halloween.
[3782.36s -> 3784.16s]  You guys have a good Thanksgiving?
[3788.87s -> 3789.67s]  This is a chill stream.
[3789.67s -> 3790.07s]  Yeah, it is.
[3800.19s -> 3800.99s]  Oh, all right.
[3800.99s -> 3801.79s]  So it's in here.
[3803.29s -> 3804.19s]  Oh, okay.
[3804.19s -> 3805.49s]  Background music settings.
[3807.45s -> 3808.45s]  Just haven't been anything, right?
[3810.29s -> 3811.29s]  It's gonna shuffle then.
[3811.69s -> 3812.69s]  Oh, I have to set it.
[3817.53s -> 3818.43s]  Will it just shuffle?
[3818.63s -> 3819.53s]  Is it the only one through that I have?
[3822.17s -> 3822.87s]  I was gonna pick this one.
[3834.56s -> 3835.36s]  I don't celebrate.
[3836.16s -> 3837.06s]  Well, if you do, then you do.
[3839.58s -> 3840.28s]  Get at the bottom.
[3841.18s -> 3843.28s]  How do I, um, make it so it will?
[3845.03s -> 3845.83s]  I don't know how to do it.
[3845.83s -> 3846.43s]  I just picked one.
[3846.43s -> 3846.93s]  Let's see what it is.
[3857.32s -> 3857.82s]  Is it different?
[3861.69s -> 3862.39s]  Oh, okay.
[3863.84s -> 3867.39s]  Ooh, this is cool.
[3872.39s -> 3873.39s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[3874.09s -> 3875.29s]  I can't use the analog anymore.
[3884.72s -> 3885.22s]  Six.
[3887.24s -> 3887.94s]  This one's five.
[3891.47s -> 3892.47s]  Oh, this is juicy.
[3892.47s -> 3892.87s]  Look at this.
[3898.66s -> 3899.16s]  This is juicy.
[3912.04s -> 3913.24s]  That's, look at how juicy that was.
[3914.32s -> 3915.02s]  Not even done either.
[3920.63s -> 3921.23s]  Oh my God.
[3921.23s -> 3921.83s]  That was juicy.
[3932.60s -> 3933.10s]  Can't be there.
[3934.78s -> 3935.38s]  Gotta be here.
[3935.58s -> 3936.18s]  Gotta be here.
[3936.98s -> 3937.28s]  There.
[3937.48s -> 3937.78s]  There.
[3938.08s -> 3938.58s]  Wait, what?
[3938.68s -> 3938.88s]  What?
[3938.88s -> 3939.48s]  What happened?
[3939.88s -> 3940.58s]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[3940.58s -> 3941.38s]  I went too fast.
[3942.25s -> 3944.25s]  I should have known because that was, that was the two.
[3944.25s -> 3944.95s]  Well, I went too fast.
[3947.67s -> 3948.27s]  That was juicy.
[3948.67s -> 3949.37s]  It was juicy.
[3951.22s -> 3951.52s]  What?
[3952.66s -> 3953.36s]  Stop saying that.
[3954.88s -> 3955.38s]  Why not?
[3955.38s -> 3956.08s]  What do you mean stop?
[3956.38s -> 3957.98s]  Stop saying juicy.
[3961.67s -> 3962.87s]  What's wrong with everybody today?
[3963.47s -> 3965.37s]  I can't say this was a juicy one.
[3967.02s -> 3967.62s]  Why?
[3972.41s -> 3975.31s]  You have 18,000 people watching you play Picross.
[3979.04s -> 3979.44s]  I don't know.
[3983.15s -> 3983.85s]  Dude, come on.
[3984.45s -> 3986.25s]  I feel like that's like insulting to me.
[3987.05s -> 3987.55s]  Like what?
[3987.55s -> 3988.15s]  Is that for you?
[3988.15s -> 3988.95s]  Was that an insult?
[3992.49s -> 3992.79s]  What was that?
[3992.79s -> 3993.89s]  Is that gonna insult?
[3995.15s -> 3995.85s]  Oh, you think I'm funny?
[3996.25s -> 3996.35s]  What?
[3996.35s -> 3997.05s]  I'm funny to you?
[3997.15s -> 3997.95s]  Well, funny how like how?
[3998.75s -> 4000.15s]  Funny when I amuse you?
[4000.15s -> 4000.95s]  Funny like a clown?
[4000.95s -> 4001.65s]  No, tell me.
[4001.65s -> 4002.95s]  I want to know what you fucking mean by that.
[4004.31s -> 4006.21s]  I should say you say funny things.
[4006.21s -> 4007.11s]  I say funny things, huh?
[4013.65s -> 4014.85s]  Well, like I amuse you.
[4017.76s -> 4018.86s]  That is one of the best scenes.
[4019.26s -> 4020.46s]  Like that scene is crazy.
[4031.43s -> 4032.23s]  Not a big deal.
[4037.01s -> 4037.71s]  That's classic.
[4037.71s -> 4038.41s]  That's a classic one.
[4042.57s -> 4045.27s]  Hey, I think there's people here because it's in the title.
[4045.67s -> 4049.27s]  How many people have eaten their Thanksgiving turkey?
[4050.17s -> 4052.47s]  And they're on the couch just sitting there with their phone going like this.
[4059.89s -> 4061.29s]  I didn't press the button.
[4063.51s -> 4064.31s]  Here's a quick tip for you.
[4064.31s -> 4067.11s]  If you want to know about Picross, if it's one large number,
[4067.51s -> 4072.48s]  just count the amount it takes to get to whatever the fold of the cap here is,
[4072.48s -> 4073.08s]  which is 10.
[4073.88s -> 4075.88s]  And that's what's left on both sides.
[4076.58s -> 4077.68s]  So let's say it's seven.
[4077.68s -> 4080.48s]  You're going to leave three on both sides because seven plus three is ten.
[4080.58s -> 4082.28s]  So therefore the middle four will be filled in.
[4082.88s -> 4083.98s]  That's an easy way to do it.
[4083.98s -> 4086.58s]  And for all of you that are going to be playing it later this afternoon.
[4087.28s -> 4087.78s]  How is it?
[4087.78s -> 4088.08s]  Whatever.
[4097.29s -> 4105.62s]  Yeah, thanks for the tip.
[4106.02s -> 4109.69s]  Play Professor Layton?
[4109.69s -> 4110.79s]  No, I can't play that game.
[4111.19s -> 4112.19s]  That game pisses me off.
[4114.93s -> 4117.13s]  I actually get angry when I play that.
[4121.89s -> 4126.69s]  It's just like all the all the so many of those puzzles in Layton just get so
[4128.17s -> 4129.27s]  my brain just can't do it.
[4129.37s -> 4130.47s]  I'd rather just play Picross.
[4135.06s -> 4136.26s]  Okay, so can I do anything with six?
[4137.78s -> 4138.68s]  Six, I can.
[4141.47s -> 4146.90s]  Again, leave four on both sides because that has to be the middle ones and therefore
[4146.90s -> 4147.80s]  look what we just did.
[4150.31s -> 4151.01s]  Layton is pretty tough.
[4151.01s -> 4151.41s]  It is.
[4151.41s -> 4151.71s]  It is.
[4151.71s -> 4152.61s]  And that's it's fun.
[4152.61s -> 4157.91s]  I just I get to a point in Layton where I get to the first ten puzzles and then they
[4157.91s -> 4159.21s]  get too hard where I go.
[4159.21s -> 4160.21s]  I don't really care anymore.
[4160.31s -> 4161.21s]  It was fun while it lasted.
[4170.89s -> 4171.79s]  Oh, this is eight one.
[4171.79s -> 4185.80s]  Okay, that would be part of the five.
[4185.80s -> 4196.31s]  One, two, can't be there, can't be there, can't be there.
[4199.11s -> 4203.39s]  So then this is interesting.
[4203.39s -> 4205.19s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[4206.19s -> 4208.19s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[4208.19s -> 4212.09s]  Can't quite put something here because I don't know but I could actually.
[4213.69s -> 4214.19s]  Yeah, I could.
[4219.33s -> 4219.83s]  Is it two?
[4225.37s -> 4226.07s]  He's in music.
[4226.17s -> 4227.37s]  Jerma, you are fucked up.
[4227.87s -> 4228.47s]  What did I do?
[4228.67s -> 4231.77s]  I want you to explain to me what I did in the last 10 to 25 seconds.
[4235.41s -> 4238.71s]  In the last 30 seconds, I did something so fucked up that you wrote that.
[4238.71s -> 4239.31s]  But what did I do?
[4240.31s -> 4243.61s]  All I've been saying is okay, so that's one, two, three, four, five.
[4243.71s -> 4244.71s]  Okay, there it is.
[4245.51s -> 4246.51s]  And there's two.
[4246.61s -> 4248.41s]  What did I do that was that screwed up right there?
[4248.41s -> 4249.11s]  I want to know.
[4249.81s -> 4250.31s]  Tell me.
[4254.02s -> 4256.32s]  Oh, dude, you are so fucked up.
[4258.80s -> 4260.20s]  And what's your language by the way?
[4280.21s -> 4281.11s]  That's the middle two.
[4281.11s -> 4282.11s]  So can I go this?
[4283.78s -> 4284.98s]  I can but I don't know that yet.
[4290.21s -> 4293.45s]  This is obviously the two but it could be either one of these spots.
[4293.65s -> 4294.05s]  I don't know.
[4297.29s -> 4298.09s]  Turn the music down.
[4299.63s -> 4303.13s]  You understand that there are like at least a half dozen Miku fans in here that
[4303.13s -> 4305.03s]  it can be very mad at me if I turn the music down.
[4307.53s -> 4308.53s]  At least a half dozen.
[4320.51s -> 4322.21s]  You're like I'm missing something that I can do right now.
[4323.56s -> 4323.96s]  Five?
[4327.94s -> 4328.24s]  Yeah.
[4328.98s -> 4329.38s]  Okay.
[4329.88s -> 4330.68s]  Well, the one is here.
[4330.78s -> 4331.48s]  All right, that helps.
[4331.98s -> 4335.41s]  Two, three, four, five, six.
[4336.91s -> 4338.11s]  Three, four, five, six.
[4339.73s -> 4340.43s]  Oh, there we go.
[4341.54s -> 4342.04s]  Nice.
[4343.42s -> 4344.22s]  That has to be over here.
[4348.66s -> 4350.06s]  This is a one so it could be here.
[4350.06s -> 4351.76s]  This is also a two so it could be here as well.
[4358.47s -> 4359.67s]  Yeah, two in the top row is done.
[4359.67s -> 4360.27s]  That's true.
[4362.63s -> 4365.13s]  Then this five, one, two, three, four, five.
[4365.13s -> 4365.83s]  There it is.
[4368.92s -> 4370.62s]  Okay, so that's not available.
[4370.62s -> 4371.62s]  This is available.
[4373.54s -> 4376.44s]  This is not four.
[4376.44s -> 4377.54s]  This is four.
[4380.98s -> 4382.68s]  And now this is part of the two.
[4385.40s -> 4388.00s]  I think it's here, but I don't know that for sure yet.
[4388.00s -> 4388.80s]  So I'm not going to do it.
[4389.60s -> 4394.82s]  One, two, three, four, five, five, six.
[4394.82s -> 4396.62s]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[4403.26s -> 4403.66s]  What?
[4404.36s -> 4404.86s]  How?
[4406.68s -> 4407.48s]  What did I do wrong?
[4407.58s -> 4408.38s]  Wait, what happened?
[4410.08s -> 4411.18s]  Two, one.
[4412.15s -> 4412.65s]  Uh-oh.
[4415.16s -> 4416.86s]  Oh, I mean I marked it wrong.
[4418.16s -> 4418.56s]  Shit.
[4418.96s -> 4420.46s]  Oh, that's what happens when you deduce wrong.
[4423.88s -> 4424.38s]  Sorry, I'm good.
[4431.04s -> 4432.44s]  You scared Luca.
[4432.54s -> 4433.84s]  What do you mean I scared Luca?
[4438.14s -> 4438.74s]  Oh.
[4445.51s -> 4446.11s]  A headset.
[4446.21s -> 4446.81s]  That's okay.
[4446.81s -> 4447.21s]  That's cool.
[4450.42s -> 4451.82s]  Dude, this guy deduces.
[4458.58s -> 4460.18s]  Sorry, I have a full plate of spaghetti over here.
[4470.44s -> 4470.94s]  So I changed it.
[4471.24s -> 4472.34s]  What should I put the music to then?
[4475.00s -> 4476.90s]  Because I have to set it for the puzzle background music.
[4477.80s -> 4478.50s]  You guys have to pick one.
[4481.74s -> 4483.94s]  Which one of these should be puzzle background music?
[4485.64s -> 4486.74s]  These are instrumental.
[4486.74s -> 4487.24s]  That's why.
[4487.24s -> 4487.74s]  Okay.
[4488.34s -> 4488.94s]  What about this one?
[4492.50s -> 4493.40s]  These are all instrumental.
[4496.42s -> 4496.92s]  Third one.
[4498.62s -> 4499.02s]  May I?
[4499.02s -> 4499.82s]  Okay, one, two.
[4499.82s -> 4500.42s]  Yeah, we'll do this one.
[4504.05s -> 4504.35s]  I don't know.
[4504.35s -> 4505.45s]  You're the Miku expert.
[4505.75s -> 4507.05s]  I'm not a Miku expert.
[4509.08s -> 4513.38s]  Guys, I thought Miku was somebody actually singing until a year and a half ago.
[4515.19s -> 4515.59s]  I don't know.
[4515.59s -> 4516.59s]  I didn't know very much.
[4522.64s -> 4525.44s]  I thought it was a gorilla's scenario.
[4527.79s -> 4528.89s]  That just shows how much I knew.
[4531.43s -> 4532.33s]  Somebody said it's not.
[4532.33s -> 4533.13s]  No, it's not.
[4533.13s -> 4533.73s]  It's a...
[4535.33s -> 4536.03s]  It's a robot.
[4536.83s -> 4537.33s]  It's a...
[4537.93s -> 4538.33s]  She's a...
[4538.53s -> 4539.53s]  What do they call him?
[4540.43s -> 4541.03s]  Vocaloid?
[4545.97s -> 4546.77s]  Yeah, she's a Vocaloid.
[4546.87s -> 4547.17s]  Yeah.
[4550.02s -> 4551.62s]  It's that Vocaloid technology.
[4559.60s -> 4560.40s]  You happy with this one?
[4568.83s -> 4569.83s]  She's more real than you.
[4573.48s -> 4573.78s]  All right.
[4577.23s -> 4578.43s]  She's more real than you.
[4586.38s -> 4587.98s]  She's real to me, but sad.
[4588.68s -> 4589.38s]  We're crying.
[4591.31s -> 4591.61s]  I...
[4594.97s -> 4595.47s]  Be mean?
[4595.47s -> 4596.47s]  I'm not being mean?
[4597.17s -> 4597.97s]  I didn't do anything.
[4599.07s -> 4600.87s]  Miku is a wonderful character.
[4601.17s -> 4602.87s]  When did I say anything bad about Miku?
[4602.97s -> 4603.37s]  Ever.
[4604.17s -> 4604.77s]  Are you serious?
[4608.02s -> 4610.02s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[4626.32s -> 4627.62s]  Apology with tears.
[4627.72s -> 4629.22s]  I didn't say anything.
[4640.89s -> 4643.59s]  Hey, go make an open-faced turkey sandwich.
[4645.33s -> 4647.23s]  You just made 18,000 people cry.
[4650.32s -> 4651.12s]  I'm playing my game.
[4651.52s -> 4653.02s]  Everybody chill out.
[4653.02s -> 4653.72s]  It's Thanksgiving.
[4655.43s -> 4656.43s]  One, two, three.
[4656.83s -> 4657.53s]  Can't be any of these.
[4657.93s -> 4658.73s]  I love when it does this.
[4662.23s -> 4662.83s]  So this is...
[4662.83s -> 4663.13s]  All right.
[4663.13s -> 4663.73s]  So here we go.
[4665.78s -> 4667.88s]  So that means one, two, three, four, five, six.
[4668.48s -> 4669.18s]  Has to be in here.
[4669.18s -> 4669.58s]  Is it that?
[4669.58s -> 4670.38s]  Do I have it already?
[4672.56s -> 4673.36s]  That's pretty close.
[4677.86s -> 4679.06s]  Is this the three or the two?
[4683.20s -> 4684.30s]  This has to be the three, right?
[4686.58s -> 4687.28s]  Why are you so mean?
[4695.46s -> 4697.06s]  If I get this, then it's good to go.
[4698.86s -> 4700.06s]  I didn't say you say sorry to Miku.
[4700.16s -> 4700.86s]  I'm sorry, Miku.
[4700.96s -> 4701.36s]  There you go.
[4701.46s -> 4702.26s]  Now tell me if I'm right.
[4706.86s -> 4707.56s]  I think it's the...
[4708.36s -> 4708.96s]  It's the three.
[4708.96s -> 4709.16s]  Yeah.
[4711.64s -> 4712.24s]  The two?
[4712.74s -> 4713.24s]  Where would the...
[4713.24s -> 4713.74s]  No.
[4713.94s -> 4725.09s]  Oh my God.
[4725.19s -> 4725.39s]  All right.
[4725.39s -> 4726.89s]  So this is obviously part of the three.
[4726.99s -> 4727.39s]  So this is...
[4727.39s -> 4728.89s]  I can do a lot of deduction here.
[4737.55s -> 4739.95s]  One, two, three, face one.
[4744.22s -> 4745.52s]  One, two, three, four.
[4746.20s -> 4747.10s]  One, two, three, four.
[4747.10s -> 4748.70s]  I don't know if that's correct or not.
[4748.80s -> 4749.20s]  This is...
[4749.20s -> 4750.00s]  Probably the six.
[4756.84s -> 4758.24s]  I wanted to press the other button.
[4761.68s -> 4763.08s]  Can you please do an ASMR stream?
[4763.08s -> 4763.48s]  Yeah, sure.
[4763.48s -> 4764.68s]  Let me just get a little bit more of my spaghetti.
[4773.56s -> 4774.36s]  I wanted to press the other button.
[4780.74s -> 4781.44s]  Why is it so wet?
[4781.64s -> 4782.74s]  I have to put extra sauce on it.
[4784.64s -> 4787.74s]  My spaghetti sits in at least two or three inches of sauce.
[4789.93s -> 4791.93s]  And then when I'm done, I tip it up like this and I drink it.
[4805.80s -> 4806.80s]  Do you really think I do that?
[4814.20s -> 4814.90s]  Be honest with yourself.
[4816.77s -> 4817.47s]  Sit here and think.
[4818.27s -> 4819.07s]  What does your eyes have to do?
[4819.17s -> 4819.67s]  You say...
[4820.94s -> 4822.34s]  Does a person actually do that?
[4823.40s -> 4823.70s]  No.
[4824.10s -> 4825.00s]  No, but no way.
[4826.88s -> 4828.18s]  Glad we could figure this out together.
[4833.08s -> 4834.08s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight.
[4834.08s -> 4834.28s]  No.
[4834.28s -> 4835.08s]  Oh, I think I got it.
[4837.44s -> 4838.14s]  This has to be there.
[4843.34s -> 4844.44s]  That helps a lot.
[4853.60s -> 4853.90s]  Cool.
[4855.05s -> 4856.15s]  What are you talking about?
[4856.15s -> 4857.25s]  I've got three X's.
[4860.01s -> 4860.91s]  I'm trying to go too fast.
[4863.86s -> 4864.66s]  Somebody said, what is that?
[4864.66s -> 4865.26s]  Copypasta?
[4865.26s -> 4865.96s]  I'm not going to read it.
[4866.06s -> 4867.26s]  What about smelling me or something?
[4867.26s -> 4867.56s]  Whatever.
[4869.47s -> 4869.57s]  All right.
[4869.57s -> 4870.27s]  So this is the...
[4870.67s -> 4871.97s]  Two is right here.
[4883.86s -> 4884.16s]  All right.
[4884.46s -> 4884.86s]  We got it now.
[4890.37s -> 4894.72s]  One, one, four, three.
[4895.02s -> 4895.62s]  There it is.
[4895.62s -> 4895.82s]  All right.
[4895.82s -> 4896.72s]  I got a lot of X's.
[4899.38s -> 4900.08s]  Don't read it.
[4911.90s -> 4912.80s]  I think I can get a new song.
[4915.71s -> 4917.11s]  I mean, the mods are just sniping it.
[4917.11s -> 4919.61s]  So I really probably shouldn't read it.
[4919.61s -> 4920.41s]  I'm not going to read it.
[4922.66s -> 4924.86s]  It's not going to read it because it's like as weird.
[4927.82s -> 4928.62s]  I need a new song.
[4928.62s -> 4929.12s]  I need some help.
[4934.31s -> 4934.81s]  I think I have enough.
[4937.60s -> 4939.20s]  Is particle miracle any good?
[4941.64s -> 4942.54s]  You're a weird guy.
[4942.54s -> 4942.94s]  Read it.
[4945.34s -> 4949.04s]  You could be kind of a weird guy and not be kind of a gross guy.
[4953.08s -> 4953.58s]  Is this one good?
[4964.08s -> 4965.18s]  What about coloring?
[4965.38s -> 4965.88s]  I'll do this one.
[4968.30s -> 4969.30s]  I already own this.
[4969.60s -> 4969.90s]  What?
[4972.04s -> 4974.04s]  I already have this one already.
[4980.06s -> 4981.06s]  What about by your side?
[4981.46s -> 4985.70s]  Oh, why was that locked?
[4985.70s -> 4986.30s]  I already have it.
[4995.17s -> 4996.07s]  I actually like this one.
[4996.47s -> 4997.77s]  It'd be a puzzle background.
[4997.77s -> 5008.13s]  I think this one's kind of cool.
[5012.97s -> 5013.47s]  I'll do this one.
[5020.94s -> 5021.74s]  Yeah, I'll keep this one.
[5023.35s -> 5024.85s]  These songs are really obscure.
[5028.96s -> 5031.26s]  What a special complete one large artwork.
[5033.87s -> 5035.37s]  Well, let's clear this whole thing first.
[5040.78s -> 5041.88s]  They're very obscure.
[5041.88s -> 5042.28s]  Really?
[5052.50s -> 5052.90s]  Whoops.
[5052.90s -> 5053.80s]  I went with the garbage one.
[5056.86s -> 5057.66s]  There are another nine.
[5057.86s -> 5058.56s]  Seven are here.
[5061.55s -> 5062.35s]  Any other big ones?
[5062.35s -> 5063.05s]  The six.
[5064.79s -> 5065.69s]  Another six.
[5067.59s -> 5071.19s]  Remember that it has to be here because just of absolute standard deduction.
[5073.79s -> 5074.69s]  Any more big ones?
[5077.07s -> 5078.57s]  Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[5078.97s -> 5079.87s]  Now I can get that in a minute.
[5079.87s -> 5080.07s]  All right.
[5080.07s -> 5080.67s]  Let's go for it.
[5101.51s -> 5102.21s]  But what did I do wrong?
[5102.21s -> 5102.71s]  I got it right.
[5104.96s -> 5105.36s]  Stop.
[5105.36s -> 5105.96s]  Stop what?
[5108.46s -> 5109.76s]  This is pretty good popcorn scream.
[5109.86s -> 5110.66s]  That's pretty cool.
[5111.16s -> 5112.36s]  You made a fresh thing of popcorn?
[5113.43s -> 5113.83s]  Cool.
[5135.60s -> 5136.80s]  Fresh popcorn is the best.
[5138.60s -> 5139.60s]  And nothing beats.
[5141.58s -> 5141.98s]  You know what?
[5141.98s -> 5144.98s]  I really do love just sort of carnival food.
[5147.94s -> 5148.64s]  Popcorn.
[5149.14s -> 5149.94s]  Fresh pop.
[5151.24s -> 5152.34s]  It's not much that's better.
[5154.11s -> 5155.31s]  The stuff in the microwave is good.
[5155.31s -> 5155.91s]  It's fine.
[5156.51s -> 5161.31s]  But when you're at a fair and that machine is just bacon.
[5161.91s -> 5167.11s]  You wash the little pan bubble over and it fills up.
[5167.21s -> 5168.41s]  They get the big scooper.
[5168.81s -> 5169.41s]  It's hot.
[5170.51s -> 5171.71s]  That's like you have a clown diet.
[5173.14s -> 5173.94s]  I don't eat good.
[5175.20s -> 5175.80s]  It's fun.
[5175.90s -> 5176.40s]  It's good.
[5177.00s -> 5178.00s]  I just don't eat it every day.
[5180.10s -> 5185.24s]  I actually prefer bear slash carnival popcorn over movie theater popcorn.
[5185.84s -> 5189.71s]  Movie theater popcorn is a little way down for me.
[5189.71s -> 5192.61s]  It's a little too oily and too much greasy in a way.
[5192.61s -> 5193.71s]  It's like too much.
[5195.01s -> 5197.31s]  The pop stuff at the carnival is light.
[5197.91s -> 5199.11s]  It's nice and salty and hot.
[5199.31s -> 5203.41s]  It's not as way down as movie theater butter tastes.
[5210.70s -> 5212.90s]  That's not to say I don't like movie theater popcorn.
[5212.90s -> 5213.20s]  I do.
[5213.20s -> 5215.70s]  I love it, but I never eat it all.
[5216.10s -> 5218.80s]  I always try to get a small and you just kind of like blah.
[5218.90s -> 5221.30s]  Like just eating like a pad of butter.
[5224.58s -> 5225.68s]  I don't like sweet popcorn.
[5226.08s -> 5226.58s]  Not really.
[5228.54s -> 5232.44s]  There are some things that I just do not like to be sweet popcorn is one of them.
[5234.28s -> 5237.68s]  And I know that there's a lot of you know, it could be both right?
[5237.68s -> 5239.58s]  There's a lot of things like that, but I don't I'm not into it.
[5243.20s -> 5249.50s]  I've had obviously caramel popcorn before and it's good, but I would not put it anywhere even close to regular popcorn.
[5251.48s -> 5252.38s]  This is the one of the two.
[5253.35s -> 5254.75s]  This is probably the one I'm going for it.
[5254.95s -> 5255.45s]  I was wrong.
[5257.32s -> 5258.02s]  That's a stupid move.
[5274.45s -> 5275.15s]  Actually kind of helped.
[5279.64s -> 5280.04s]  What is it?
[5283.36s -> 5283.96s]  Choker.
[5285.82s -> 5286.22s]  Gallery.
[5288.00s -> 5288.90s]  What about kettle corn?
[5289.60s -> 5293.88s]  Um, I don't think I've had like, I don't know.
[5294.18s -> 5296.18s]  The real kettle corn is just sugary, right?
[5304.14s -> 5305.34s]  It's just sweet sugary.
[5305.94s -> 5306.64s]  A little salty too.
[5306.64s -> 5307.14s]  It's like both.
[5317.36s -> 5317.56s]  Yeah.
[5317.66s -> 5318.36s]  Are we going to probably move in?
[5318.46s -> 5319.16s]  Are these 15?
[5319.96s -> 5320.06s]  All right.
[5320.06s -> 5321.06s]  There's a lot of 10 by 10s.
[5321.06s -> 5321.96s]  When's the, when do you get to?
[5322.26s -> 5322.56s]  All right.
[5322.56s -> 5324.66s]  Actually, I might be able to do most of these.
[5326.00s -> 5331.07s]  I don't have a time limit for the stream, but I just was going to hang out for three hours.
[5332.27s -> 5333.37s]  Whenever I'm just kind of done.
[5334.80s -> 5335.20s]  I don't know.
[5335.20s -> 5337.60s]  I like this idea of just kind of a strip.
[5337.60s -> 5338.20s]  I don't, I don't know.
[5339.94s -> 5343.64s]  I want to try this thing where streams don't have to be like six, seven hours long.
[5344.54s -> 5345.94s]  Like five, six, seven hours long.
[5347.08s -> 5348.68s]  I can just do them whenever.
[5348.98s -> 5351.18s]  Just maybe they're shorter, but just do them whenever.
[5352.51s -> 5353.31s]  No, I'm not leaving yet.
[5361.10s -> 5362.20s]  Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[5362.20s -> 5362.40s]  Okay.
[5362.40s -> 5363.00s]  So I can do this.
[5367.88s -> 5368.38s]  It's very good.
[5377.90s -> 5379.10s]  You made her sad.
[5379.20s -> 5379.80s]  Apologize.
[5387.14s -> 5387.34s]  Okay.
[5387.34s -> 5388.04s]  This is four.
[5388.24s -> 5389.04s]  It can only be here.
[5391.17s -> 5392.07s]  I'm going so fast.
[5392.17s -> 5393.17s]  Look at how, look at how happy she is.
[5425.35s -> 5431.02s]  Maybe one or two.
[5436.37s -> 5437.17s]  That was pretty flawless.
[5439.48s -> 5440.58s]  My mom loves Jerma.
[5444.33s -> 5451.18s]  Um, if your mom doesn't think I'm bad or anything.
[5459.60s -> 5460.50s]  I didn't stay on this for very long.
[5465.16s -> 5466.26s]  My mom is a fan of you.
[5466.76s -> 5467.16s]  Really?
[5467.66s -> 5468.46s]  My mom hates you.
[5468.86s -> 5469.56s]  I have a feeling.
[5469.56s -> 5473.06s]  I don't know what the moms love him.
[5479.08s -> 5480.28s]  Well, I will say this.
[5480.68s -> 5484.38s]  If you have a relationship with your parents or your mother where you can
[5484.38s -> 5488.08s]  both enjoy the same thing, potentially enjoy the same media.
[5489.45s -> 5491.15s]  That's actually pretty, that's pretty awesome.
[5492.25s -> 5493.05s]  That's really, really nice.
[5493.95s -> 5494.45s]  That's sweet.
[5494.75s -> 5495.05s]  It is.
[5496.25s -> 5499.65s]  So that makes me kind of happy that you can kind of enjoy things
[5499.65s -> 5500.55s]  as you know, together.
[5502.40s -> 5503.00s]  That's pretty cool.
[5508.16s -> 5508.36s]  All right.
[5508.36s -> 5509.66s]  Seven, eight, nine.
[5534.02s -> 5534.32s]  All right.
[5534.32s -> 5538.06s]  So six, seven, we can do a lot here.
[5539.13s -> 5540.13s]  I don't want to get it wrong.
[5558.22s -> 5559.02s]  Two, three, four.
[5559.52s -> 5560.62s]  One, two, three, four.
[5563.56s -> 5564.36s]  Well, here's your five.
[5578.19s -> 5579.28s]  Five.
[5579.38s -> 5579.98s]  Here's your two.
[5582.55s -> 5583.15s]  Here's your four.
[5583.65s -> 5584.35s]  Here comes your three.
[5586.25s -> 5586.85s]  This is your six.
[5588.14s -> 5588.74s]  Here's your four.
[5590.54s -> 5591.74s]  This is part of your three, obviously.
[5591.84s -> 5592.64s]  This is part of your four.
[5599.89s -> 5600.49s]  Here's your three.
[5600.99s -> 5601.59s]  Here's your two.
[5605.09s -> 5606.29s]  They're your reptile eyes.
[5607.12s -> 5607.72s]  I'm a human.
[5619.41s -> 5621.71s]  Dude, when you just get in the zone on some of them, it's awesome.
[5622.01s -> 5622.61s]  Feels so good.
[5652.77s -> 5653.27s]  I don't know that yet.
[5660.98s -> 5662.48s]  Can you please do a Bernie Sanders impression?
[5663.54s -> 5665.34s]  Uh, no, it's a chill day.
[5665.88s -> 5666.28s]  Chillin' out.
[5668.10s -> 5670.00s]  No human likes Picross this much.
[5672.26s -> 5672.96s]  Can I ask you a question?
[5676.11s -> 5681.73s]  On the Sunday paper, when you pick it up and you do the crossword
[5681.73s -> 5685.51s]  every weekend, does that make you a weirdo?
[5687.24s -> 5690.04s]  Hundreds of millions of people that do crossword every week.
[5695.18s -> 5695.78s]  Hold on a minute.
[5695.88s -> 5698.18s]  Let me, let me get this, let me get this for your generation.
[5699.18s -> 5703.18s]  When you open up Wordle every day, still human?
[5705.05s -> 5705.85s]  You still human?
[5708.75s -> 5709.15s]  Hmm.
[5710.88s -> 5712.68s]  I don't play Wordle nearly as much as you do.
[5714.88s -> 5717.28s]  I got Picross that I play every, you know, every few weeks.
[5717.28s -> 5718.68s]  Maybe I'll jump on and do a game.
[5718.68s -> 5719.68s]  You do Wordle every day.
[5721.88s -> 5722.28s]  Still human?
[5739.66s -> 5742.36s]  People play, what is it, people play it all the time.
[5744.81s -> 5745.71s]  Well, okay.
[5745.81s -> 5748.21s]  Everybody was giving me shit earlier for not reading.
[5748.71s -> 5753.71s]  But this is very clearly a game of logic and reasoning and deduction
[5753.71s -> 5754.91s]  and making your brain work.
[5755.01s -> 5756.11s]  How, why is this a bad thing?
[5759.36s -> 5761.86s]  Well, I'm not, I'm not playing Call of Duty today.
[5764.44s -> 5769.14s]  I'm not playing, I'm not playing the FPS Call of Duty game.
[5769.14s -> 5769.94s]  Therefore what?
[5772.04s -> 5774.44s]  No, we're deduced, we're deducting today.
[5784.74s -> 5787.14s]  All right, let me restart because somebody called me a red-filled
[5787.14s -> 5789.44s]  Redditor and I don't even like, what is that even supposed to mean?
[5791.31s -> 5793.75s]  All right, we can do this.
[5812.38s -> 5813.28s]  I don't know why that's doing it.
[5813.28s -> 5814.48s]  That's just like making me laugh.
[5814.48s -> 5815.18s]  I don't know why.
[5818.77s -> 5819.97s]  Red-filled Redditor.
[5822.99s -> 5824.79s]  That sounds like such a shitty superhero name.
[5836.54s -> 5837.14s]  Happy Turkey Day.
[5837.14s -> 5838.04s]  Yeah, YouTube.
[5844.00s -> 5846.50s]  With this X being here, I think I can do the left side, but I just,
[5846.50s -> 5847.60s]  my brain's too small to do it.
[5858.39s -> 5859.59s]  This is definitely the two.
[5873.19s -> 5873.79s]  Can you stand up?
[5873.79s -> 5873.99s]  No.
[5886.80s -> 5890.52s]  No, no, I'm not going to stand up.
[5898.73s -> 5899.63s]  No, why?
[5899.63s -> 5900.73s]  I'm not, I'm not doing that.
[5901.23s -> 5902.73s]  No, I've had this nightmare like five times.
[5902.73s -> 5903.23s]  I'm not doing it.
[5904.68s -> 5906.28s]  I've had this nightmare five times.
[5906.58s -> 5907.58s]  I keep having this dream.
[5907.58s -> 5908.38s]  I'm not doing it.
[5908.48s -> 5909.18s]  I'm not standing up.
[5925.52s -> 5926.52s]  What's your opinion on Dr.
[5926.52s -> 5928.02s]  Pepper flavored baked beans?
[5928.82s -> 5929.42s]  That's weird.
[5929.82s -> 5932.62s]  I don't have an opinion on it, but my first initial reaction is
[5932.62s -> 5933.42s]  that's a little strange.
[5935.94s -> 5936.94s]  Probably all I have for you though.
[5961.18s -> 5963.18s]  Is he actually naked or is this hinting at it?
[5963.48s -> 5964.28s]  No, I do.
[5964.28s -> 5966.08s]  Okay, I'll stand off.
[5966.08s -> 5966.68s]  Whatever.
[5968.07s -> 5968.57s]  I have pain.
[5968.57s -> 5970.87s]  I'm just, I don't know if I've had this nightmare.
[5971.57s -> 5972.67s]  I'm letting the nightmares happening.
[5973.93s -> 5975.03s]  What if the nightmare happens?
[5976.93s -> 5978.23s]  What if the nightmare actually happens?
[5978.53s -> 5978.83s]  Hold on.
[5978.83s -> 5979.73s]  I'm turning the camera off.
[5985.89s -> 5987.39s]  No, this is like, this is a nightmare.
[5991.27s -> 5992.07s]  All right, standing up.
[5995.53s -> 5996.03s]  Standing up.
[5997.32s -> 5997.72s]  Come up.
[6000.83s -> 6001.63s]  I'm, I stood up.
[6006.50s -> 6007.10s]  You're short.
[6009.77s -> 6010.97s]  I didn't stand up all the way.
[6011.84s -> 6012.64s]  Throw your pants.
[6013.14s -> 6014.54s]  No, you don't need to see my pants.
[6014.94s -> 6016.04s]  You just need to know that they exist.
[6018.01s -> 6019.11s]  You, I'm burning time here.
[6019.11s -> 6020.21s]  I could have done this in three minutes.
[6023.84s -> 6024.74s]  Nice pit stains.
[6027.69s -> 6028.19s]  Shut up.
[6030.75s -> 6031.25s]  What's going on?
[6038.16s -> 6039.56s]  I told you I just burned fuel.
[6040.16s -> 6040.56s]  And I don't know.
[6040.56s -> 6041.06s]  I just do.
[6049.60s -> 6053.70s]  I feel like there's like two or three just little people in my
[6053.70s -> 6056.30s]  body shoveling coal into a furnace.
[6057.30s -> 6059.10s]  And that's like how I, that's how I function.
[6060.00s -> 6063.40s]  There's just three little like, like people just shoveling fucking
[6063.40s -> 6066.30s]  coal into a furnace and that's how I like, I operate.
[6069.52s -> 6073.42s]  My body is like an old train from like the sift 1700s.
[6084.60s -> 6086.89s]  Right here, but it might not be.
[6091.23s -> 6091.73s]  It is right there.
[6095.48s -> 6096.08s]  What was this one?
[6098.74s -> 6099.74s]  Do you heat your house up?
[6101.58s -> 6105.68s]  I, it just gets so hot in here because this computer over here,
[6105.68s -> 6106.68s]  obviously when you're streaming.
[6107.68s -> 6111.38s]  So when this computer is live and I'm live to the internet, like
[6111.38s -> 6117.22s]  I am right now, this thing has to, it's encoding every frame that
[6117.22s -> 6120.92s]  you're seeing and putting it out essentially like uploading it to
[6120.92s -> 6123.62s]  the server and coding a shitload of data.
[6124.42s -> 6128.52s]  So this computer is just sitting here, just calculating and pumping
[6128.52s -> 6134.19s]  out hot air and I could like, yeah, I could get, I have like
[6134.19s -> 6138.91s]  air conditioning and everything, but, and I'm telling you right
[6138.91s -> 6140.41s]  now, I'm not going to open a window.
[6140.81s -> 6141.81s]  You just open the window.
[6144.32s -> 6148.00s]  I have my windows just wide open while I'm sitting here talking
[6148.00s -> 6154.30s]  about like, oh yeah, I'm a red pill redditor and oh yeah, spaghetti.
[6155.50s -> 6158.90s]  I, that would not go, I don't want that just broadcasted out to
[6158.90s -> 6161.10s]  like the fucking neighbors.
[6162.00s -> 6162.70s]  Be serious.
[6165.66s -> 6167.46s]  No, these windows stay closed.
[6169.62s -> 6171.72s]  These windows stay very tightly closed.
[6173.08s -> 6173.88s]  This is a whole house.
[6183.14s -> 6184.94s]  You're broadcasting to 20,000 people.
[6185.44s -> 6185.64s]  Yeah.
[6185.64s -> 6188.04s]  Those 20,000 people have chosen to be here.
[6190.30s -> 6194.40s]  If a random neighbor in like, I don't know, like an apartment
[6194.40s -> 6197.50s]  complex or a house or a neighborhood, they didn't sign up to
[6197.50s -> 6199.30s]  hear you talk about how you shit your pants today.
[6200.46s -> 6201.76s]  They did not sign up for that.
[6204.05s -> 6206.45s]  So I don't want my, all my windows to be up well.
[6206.45s -> 6211.95s]  I'm just like, oh, what the fuck is that guy doing?
[6212.45s -> 6213.75s]  What is that guy doing?
[6214.25s -> 6215.75s]  Why is Boise like this?
[6228.15s -> 6230.15s]  That's why you, it's a chill stream.
[6230.15s -> 6231.25s]  It is, it is a chill stream.
[6238.10s -> 6240.00s]  17,000 people already seeing you do that.
[6240.00s -> 6243.10s]  I know, but you are here because you chose to be here.
[6243.70s -> 6245.00s]  You clicked on my stream.
[6245.97s -> 6247.37s]  You're not reading a book.
[6248.35s -> 6251.05s]  You're not reading a book in, in your, in your like place.
[6251.05s -> 6253.35s]  Just being like, oh yeah, this is a really relaxing day.
[6253.35s -> 6255.15s]  I'm going to keep, I'm going to put the window open today.
[6255.65s -> 6256.45s]  That's nice out.
[6260.67s -> 6264.07s]  No, no, no, no, I don't want to show my dick on camera.
[6265.17s -> 6266.47s]  I don't want to show my dick on camera.
[6269.67s -> 6270.77s]  What is that person doing?
[6272.59s -> 6273.49s]  Why is windows open?
[6273.49s -> 6274.59s]  Why is he screening this stuff?
[6276.36s -> 6277.26s]  These windows are open.
[6277.26s -> 6279.96s]  He's yelling these random things.
[6279.96s -> 6283.26s]  What could he possibly, what could you possibly be doing?
[6287.02s -> 6287.32s]  Oh yeah.
[6287.32s -> 6287.92s]  No, no, yeah.
[6287.92s -> 6289.72s]  Cause let me open up all my windows and just start, you know.
[6294.30s -> 6296.40s]  How many baseballs can I fit in my ass?
[6297.30s -> 6299.10s]  Oh, time that person out, ban that person.
[6299.60s -> 6300.80s]  Ban that person for a day.
[6304.05s -> 6308.10s]  No, not happening.
[6308.50s -> 6315.53s]  It's a chill stream, everybody.
[6329.65s -> 6331.45s]  Same reason if I feel like I'm singing.
[6332.15s -> 6334.85s]  If I ever sing in the car, let's say I have music playing a little bit
[6334.85s -> 6336.35s]  or I'm like, just sitting there like singing.
[6337.75s -> 6339.95s]  If I was singing this song, those windows are up.
[6340.65s -> 6343.55s]  There is no way I'm going to pull to a red light and be like,
[6347.45s -> 6349.25s]  whoa, that guy's singing.
[6349.25s -> 6350.25s]  That guy's singing.
[6350.25s -> 6351.15s]  That guy's singing.
[6352.15s -> 6353.15s]  How is it any different?
[6357.24s -> 6358.34s]  Can you tell me how that's different?
[6359.47s -> 6363.27s]  I know for a fact, a ton of people that do that, that all of a sudden,
[6363.27s -> 6365.27s]  oh no, I'm going to pull up to the red light.
[6365.67s -> 6366.07s]  It's like,
[6368.67s -> 6370.37s]  I'm slowing down to the red light.
[6378.81s -> 6379.21s]  The screen.
[6381.08s -> 6383.58s]  And now we go back to what we were doing.
[6383.78s -> 6384.28s]  Come on.
[6384.98s -> 6386.48s]  You can't give me shit for this one.
[6388.79s -> 6390.19s]  Don't even start with that.
[6404.31s -> 6407.31s]  This guy's only filled in four squares in three minutes.
[6410.68s -> 6411.68s]  Hey, how was your Thanksgiving?
[6415.86s -> 6416.06s]  All right.
[6416.06s -> 6417.26s]  Now I'm going to focus and I'm going to get it done.
[6417.26s -> 6417.86s]  Just relax.
[6427.76s -> 6428.46s]  What can I fill in?
[6430.74s -> 6432.14s]  Three, four, five, six, seven.
[6432.84s -> 6433.44s]  Oh, I can do this.
[6433.44s -> 6434.14s]  Probably wait.
[6438.13s -> 6438.33s]  All right.
[6438.33s -> 6438.93s]  I'm focused now.
[6438.93s -> 6450.48s]  What's a lot of low numbers.
[6452.32s -> 6454.52s]  But I just, what am I doing?
[6455.53s -> 6462.73s]  Right bumper did that one space.
[6463.83s -> 6464.53s]  I don't want to guess.
[6466.21s -> 6468.61s]  One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
[6468.61s -> 6473.26s]  So this and okay.
[6474.76s -> 6475.76s]  This is the three.
[6477.66s -> 6478.06s]  Yeah.
[6478.26s -> 6481.16s]  So here one, two, three.
[6492.66s -> 6492.86s]  All right.
[6492.86s -> 6497.16s]  So now that I know this, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[6497.96s -> 6499.66s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[6500.16s -> 6503.78s]  Oh, this is the one.
[6503.88s -> 6504.48s]  Nice.
[6507.82s -> 6510.10s]  You that's free.
[6521.38s -> 6522.88s]  This is an animal crossing song.
[6523.28s -> 6524.38s]  What is, hold on.
[6524.48s -> 6524.98s]  What did you say?
[6524.98s -> 6527.48s]  What is this animal crossing ass song?
[6529.36s -> 6531.26s]  It's this is Miku.
[6562.50s -> 6565.40s]  I was like, all right, ban him for a minute.
[6565.60s -> 6566.30s]  Ban him for a minute.
[6566.30s -> 6566.50s]  Time.
[6566.50s -> 6567.20s]  I'm up for five minutes.
[6572.20s -> 6573.50s]  I am really giggly today.
[6573.50s -> 6574.00s]  You're right.
[6579.57s -> 6579.97s]  Shit.
[6579.97s -> 6580.67s]  I have to stop.
[6580.77s -> 6581.37s]  It's tough.
[6581.37s -> 6582.27s]  I keep fucking up.
[6582.97s -> 6585.97s]  I just imagine somebody coming to the stream and just they've never
[6585.97s -> 6587.27s]  heard anything like this before.
[6588.50s -> 6590.10s]  Like what would you, what would you honestly think?
[6590.90s -> 6592.60s]  Like I've never heard a Miku song.
[6592.60s -> 6594.10s]  I have played animal crossing.
[6594.10s -> 6594.90s]  That's what I know.
[6594.90s -> 6595.70s]  That's what I have up here.
[6595.70s -> 6596.40s]  That's what I know.
[6598.40s -> 6598.90s]  What is it?
[6598.90s -> 6600.50s]  Like what is the song that I'm listening to?
[6615.10s -> 6615.30s]  All right.
[6615.30s -> 6616.70s]  I got to get, I got to get it together here.
[6631.49s -> 6633.19s]  Miku and Animal Crossing fans are the same.
[6636.62s -> 6637.92s]  They probably share a pretty big audience.
[6638.52s -> 6639.63s]  They're both fun.
[6639.93s -> 6640.63s]  Both cool.
[6662.82s -> 6663.32s]  I don't know yet.
[6667.11s -> 6667.91s]  All right, that helps.
[6680.15s -> 6680.35s]  All right.
[6680.35s -> 6681.15s]  So nothing else here.
[6681.15s -> 6684.34s]  So this is it has to be there.
[6685.50s -> 6686.00s]  What is it?
[6689.03s -> 6690.03s]  Paper tags.
[6699.74s -> 6700.14s]  New song.
[6700.14s -> 6700.54s]  All right.
[6709.66s -> 6710.46s]  This is a fun game.
[6712.16s -> 6713.56s]  I'm going to do particle miracle.
[6717.50s -> 6718.50s]  I regret my purchase.
[6721.50s -> 6721.90s]  Hold on.
[6727.51s -> 6727.91s]  Nevermind.
[6734.93s -> 6736.73s]  This is going on the puzzle part.
[6740.00s -> 6740.70s]  I thought, okay.
[6741.20s -> 6742.20s]  People like what am I and what the fuck?
[6742.20s -> 6742.50s]  What do you mean?
[6743.30s -> 6746.40s]  I thought it was an instrumental and I didn't want to buy an instrumental.
[6748.24s -> 6749.24s]  Song is fine.
[6749.34s -> 6749.94s]  Song is good.
[6750.74s -> 6751.84s]  I just thought it was an instrumental.
[6773.13s -> 6775.03s]  How do I feel about, how do I feel about visual novels?
[6775.33s -> 6776.73s]  I don't think I've ever done one.
[6781.40s -> 6783.20s]  What, what, what constitutes a visual novel?
[6784.69s -> 6785.39s]  Have I done one before?
[6798.98s -> 6799.68s]  Ace Attorney.
[6799.98s -> 6801.28s]  I told you I can't play Ace Attorney.
[6804.14s -> 6805.44s]  I physically cannot play it again.
[6806.04s -> 6807.23s]  I can't.
[6813.01s -> 6813.81s]  Why, why not?
[6815.01s -> 6815.21s]  All right.
[6815.21s -> 6817.31s]  We're going to explain this to some of the newer audience.
[6818.71s -> 6825.99s]  So every, I want to say every like every like 10 seconds to one minute.
[6827.26s -> 6833.86s]  The screen goes and flashes a white flash in your face.
[6834.86s -> 6836.56s]  Does this every 10 to 15 seconds.
[6841.10s -> 6841.80s]  And it's just like.
[6842.94s -> 6845.34s]  And here's my head and you can't turn it off.
[6856.84s -> 6857.24s]  It's not true.
[6857.24s -> 6857.64s]  It is true.
[6858.48s -> 6861.88s]  You know how I know it's true because I bought the entire Ace Attorney
[6861.88s -> 6864.18s]  remake when it came out because everyone was telling me I should be
[6864.18s -> 6867.88s]  playing it and I was so excited about it and I went in and it just
[6867.88s -> 6869.28s]  did the, it still was doing it.
[6875.30s -> 6875.50s]  All right.
[6875.50s -> 6876.20s]  I can get this here.
[6882.97s -> 6883.97s]  I can do this one too, I think.
[6885.69s -> 6887.39s]  Play romance games, please.
[6888.39s -> 6890.69s]  Remember you're balding more on your right side than your left.
[6890.69s -> 6891.49s]  That's not true.
[6891.99s -> 6894.39s]  What's happening with your, with your being, when you're experiencing,
[6894.39s -> 6896.89s]  I'll tell you, here's what you are experiencing.
[6897.69s -> 6900.62s]  You're experiencing my hair.
[6900.82s -> 6902.72s]  My hairline is here, right?
[6902.72s -> 6903.72s]  Like I'm, I just pulled it over.
[6903.72s -> 6909.62s]  My hairline is right here, but my hairstyle is kind of, I have wavy hair.
[6910.52s -> 6913.12s]  So my actual hairline is that, right?
[6913.62s -> 6916.82s]  What you're just, what you're seeing is you're seeing how it falls on one side.
[6916.82s -> 6919.22s]  So therefore you think I'm balding on one side, but not the other, but just
[6919.22s -> 6920.52s]  my hair is wavy and goes like that.
[6921.42s -> 6922.32s]  I also need a haircut.
[6922.32s -> 6927.32s]  So like this mad scientist shit back here is, should be like that.
[6927.62s -> 6928.62s]  And this should be a little shorter.
[6931.54s -> 6933.74s]  Also, I've been fucking banned for one day.
[6948.96s -> 6950.56s]  Oh, that does that.
[6966.49s -> 6967.89s]  Ooh, this is, I like this part.
[6976.08s -> 6977.38s]  There's a lot of the three two threes.
[6978.59s -> 6979.19s]  Just realized that.
[6988.02s -> 6988.52s]  It's great.
[6991.56s -> 6992.16s]  Six.
[6994.70s -> 6995.10s]  Again.
[6998.28s -> 6998.98s]  You should grow it out.
[6998.98s -> 6999.58s]  No.
[7001.82s -> 7002.52s]  Ow.
[7003.81s -> 7004.61s]  I like it like this.
[7005.31s -> 7006.31s]  If it stays like this, it's fine.
[7007.42s -> 7010.95s]  Having the, let's say medium length hair.
[7011.45s -> 7013.25s]  It's I need to, I got to clean it up though.
[7013.75s -> 7014.45s]  It's a little sloppy.
[7014.65s -> 7015.75s]  I don't know why I said haircuts.
[7025.08s -> 7026.88s]  Oh, you can sort it by character.
[7029.26s -> 7029.56s]  Can you?
[7037.51s -> 7039.11s]  Please go back to the Hillary Clinton hair.
[7050.19s -> 7051.49s]  That's never happening ever again.
[7055.88s -> 7055.98s]  All right.
[7055.98s -> 7056.78s]  What should I buy now?
[7057.62s -> 7058.12s]  What's this one?
[7059.28s -> 7059.88s]  I need more.
[7061.78s -> 7064.18s]  I think I have most of them on shuffle, but I don't think it matters.
[7066.18s -> 7070.18s]  I think the shuffle mode stuff, I think that's just in this menu.
[7071.02s -> 7076.12s]  If I press play on this, it's going to shuffle in this menu, not in the game.
[7080.14s -> 7082.84s]  How come you try to specifically like 10 seconds behind?
[7084.17s -> 7084.47s]  I don't know.
[7084.47s -> 7085.47s]  Maybe it's your connection to me.
[7087.25s -> 7087.95s]  I think that's how it works.
[7087.95s -> 7088.25s]  Right.
[7090.50s -> 7092.10s]  Like I'm West coast United States.
[7092.90s -> 7096.52s]  So maybe if you're, I don't know if you're connecting from putting it out,
[7096.62s -> 7099.72s]  broadcasting to you in Europe or something, maybe it's a little behind.
[7106.45s -> 7106.75s]  I don't know.
[7108.78s -> 7109.18s]  Please.
[7109.18s -> 7112.01s]  Popeye is in the list and the music done.
[7117.47s -> 7120.81s]  I, uh, I can we get a, um, make it a poll.
[7120.81s -> 7122.31s]  Should I turn the music down another notch?
[7125.17s -> 7126.97s]  Turn the music down one more notch.
[7126.97s -> 7127.47s]  Yes or no.
[7130.90s -> 7131.40s]  What a pull up.
[7131.40s -> 7132.20s]  Well, I forget this up.
[7132.80s -> 7135.70s]  Somebody said Popeye is in the, is it in the menu?
[7135.70s -> 7136.20s]  Where is it?
[7146.92s -> 7148.42s]  Somebody said it's in the menu.
[7148.72s -> 7149.32s]  Where is it?
[7152.21s -> 7152.71s]  No, it's not.
[7152.71s -> 7153.01s]  Okay.
[7153.01s -> 7162.37s]  I'm just being lied to being lied to switch to me.
[7162.37s -> 7162.57s]  Cool.
[7162.57s -> 7163.57s]  Let me, I'm going to change character.
[7163.57s -> 7163.77s]  Yeah.
[7168.70s -> 7169.60s]  I'm going to play the other character.
[7172.84s -> 7173.14s]  Please.
[7173.14s -> 7177.45s]  Uh, I tell, I tell, how do you say it?
[7187.98s -> 7188.08s]  Please.
[7188.08s -> 7188.78s]  I'm going to puke.
[7191.70s -> 7194.30s]  You're not going to just drop the volume of the stream a little.
[7194.70s -> 7195.00s]  I'm too.
[7195.00s -> 7196.30s]  I'm at a very good volume.
[7197.30s -> 7197.50s]  Yeah.
[7197.50s -> 7208.24s]  You just, please.
[7208.24s -> 7209.14s]  I'm going to puke.
[7210.85s -> 7211.45s]  I don't think you're good.
[7211.45s -> 7212.65s]  I think you're going to be okay.
[7213.35s -> 7214.35s]  Just turn it down.
[7214.75s -> 7215.75s]  Why are you blasting it?
[7234.00s -> 7235.40s]  Wonder if it's this one or this one.
[7239.12s -> 7240.72s]  314 is a given line, isn't it?
[7240.72s -> 7241.52s]  Let's see.
[7244.58s -> 7245.68s]  I think you're right.
[7250.98s -> 7256.35s]  You are correct.
[7256.35s -> 7256.65s]  Yes, you are.
[7260.10s -> 7261.40s]  I'm not paying attention to the bottom.
[7266.55s -> 7267.45s]  Well, I know that's that.
[7282.41s -> 7283.01s]  Bye, Germo.
[7283.31s -> 7283.61s]  Bye.
[7283.61s -> 7284.11s]  See you later.
[7285.04s -> 7285.44s]  Thanks for coming.
[7285.44s -> 7286.24s]  Hope you had a good Thanksgiving.
[7291.32s -> 7291.82s]  Music down.
[7291.82s -> 7292.12s]  No.
[7292.12s -> 7292.42s]  Okay.
[7301.46s -> 7302.36s]  I wonder if I can do the ones.
[7309.82s -> 7310.52s]  Is this the four?
[7311.55s -> 7312.15s]  Yes, it is.
[7317.41s -> 7319.51s]  Three, two, three, two.
[7319.51s -> 7320.21s]  Cool.
[7320.51s -> 7321.41s]  Two, two.
[7331.12s -> 7332.52s]  I think that's going to be it here.
[7332.52s -> 7332.82s]  Yeah.
[7342.46s -> 7344.16s]  Can you please play the music on your violin?
[7347.60s -> 7348.40s]  I owned a violin.
[7356.71s -> 7357.61s]  Do you have enough stars to?
[7359.26s -> 7360.36s]  You need to talk louder.
[7360.46s -> 7360.86s]  No.
[7367.34s -> 7368.04s]  I need a new song.
[7370.18s -> 7370.68s]  How about this one?
[7372.03s -> 7372.33s]  What?
[7372.33s -> 7373.43s]  How do I not have stars?
[7374.59s -> 7374.89s]  I got it.
[7374.89s -> 7375.09s]  Okay.
[7375.09s -> 7376.69s]  I'm going to bang out some levels really quickly here.
[7387.65s -> 7388.25s]  No more chill.
[7388.25s -> 7389.15s]  We want aggressive.
[7390.50s -> 7392.40s]  That's that's just not going to happen right now.
[7401.45s -> 7402.15s]  Let's try this one.
[7412.46s -> 7421.50s]  Zero doesn't really matter because I'm going to get all the
[7421.50s -> 7421.80s]  info.
[7421.80s -> 7422.60s]  I need her right here.
[7432.16s -> 7432.26s]  Okay.
[7432.26s -> 7432.86s]  Well, that was easy.
[7434.21s -> 7434.71s]  What was it?
[7435.94s -> 7437.44s]  One, two, three, four.
[7437.54s -> 7438.94s]  One, two, three, four.
[7451.73s -> 7453.23s]  We can also put our own soundtrack on.
[7455.24s -> 7457.34s]  How do you know the four and the and five are on their
[7457.34s -> 7458.24s]  respective sides?
[7459.04s -> 7459.94s]  That's actually a good question.
[7459.94s -> 7460.64s]  I'm going to answer it.
[7461.34s -> 7464.54s]  So on the left-hand side of the screen, say the four, it's
[7464.54s -> 7466.04s]  four space five.
[7467.55s -> 7470.65s]  What that means is the four has to be on the left side.
[7470.85s -> 7473.85s]  They have to be spaced that way.
[7474.85s -> 7478.95s]  So if it's four space five, the four has to be first.
[7478.95s -> 7480.85s]  It can't be five and then four.
[7481.35s -> 7482.95s]  It has to you read it left to right.
[7483.05s -> 7484.25s]  So left to right.
[7484.65s -> 7487.89s]  You have to put the squares in in sequence.
[7491.64s -> 7492.74s]  So see two, one, one.
[7492.74s -> 7494.74s]  It's not just like, oh, two, one, one's going to be randomly
[7494.74s -> 7495.24s]  in here.
[7495.94s -> 7499.14s]  The two has to be first, then a one and then a final one.
[7499.24s -> 7500.24s]  You can see how that looks.
[7500.24s -> 7500.94s]  It's two here.
[7501.24s -> 7502.14s]  There's a lot of space.
[7502.14s -> 7503.24s]  The space doesn't matter.
[7504.27s -> 7506.67s]  It could be one space or it could be ten spaces.
[7506.97s -> 7509.47s]  It just has to be one square in the middle.
[7509.77s -> 7522.74s]  It has to be kind of stuck.
[7524.94s -> 7525.34s]  No, I'm not.
[7529.98s -> 7531.48s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[7533.82s -> 7534.72s]  All right, reducing.
[7540.93s -> 7541.93s]  Well, I know what that is now.
[7574.64s -> 7575.34s]  Deduced.
[7583.72s -> 7585.32s]  Still have no idea how this game works.
[7588.10s -> 7589.50s]  Well, should we should I explain it?
[7602.27s -> 7603.37s]  What are you going to slurp?
[7606.16s -> 7607.46s]  You want me to do my spaghetti?
[7607.66s -> 7608.76s]  You want to have my spaghetti?
[7612.80s -> 7614.90s]  Is somebody coming to say when's the next slurp?
[7615.30s -> 7618.84s]  Is that what you said?
[7620.58s -> 7622.38s]  I need to do one more and I have enough stars.
[7622.48s -> 7634.97s]  This is a chunky one.
[7635.17s -> 7637.27s]  Can't say, you know what I mean?
[7647.20s -> 7649.20s]  Can we do a poll for Satori Landy?
[7649.60s -> 7654.57s]  I feel like you're just going to say yes to deliberately piss
[7654.57s -> 7657.87s]  off the people that don't want to hear me explain the game
[7657.87s -> 7660.27s]  for like the 12th time in the last two years.
[7661.17s -> 7662.87s]  And you're going to deliberately just try to annoy them
[7663.57s -> 7665.07s]  because I'm going to sit here for five minutes and explain
[7665.07s -> 7665.87s]  the whole game again.
[7666.57s -> 7669.37s]  That's what I know what you're doing because I would vote for
[7669.37s -> 7672.97s]  that if I'm in the chat right now and I'm watching this
[7672.97s -> 7673.57s]  streamer.
[7674.44s -> 7676.74s]  I'm going to be like, yeah, let's get him to explain the
[7676.74s -> 7677.14s]  game.
[7677.14s -> 7679.44s]  So all these people get fucking annoyed and leave.
[7681.35s -> 7684.65s]  I understand your I understand your comedic effort.
[7684.75s -> 7685.25s]  I get it.
[7686.29s -> 7687.29s]  That's why I'm shutting it down.
[7715.29s -> 7722.31s]  Three, four, five, six, three, three, four, five, six.
[7722.31s -> 7727.54s]  Okay, four, three.
[7728.14s -> 7728.94s]  Very nice.
[7730.56s -> 7731.36s]  Be over here.
[7731.76s -> 7732.86s]  Eight complete.
[7732.96s -> 7745.45s]  Three, four, three, two, three.
[7755.96s -> 7756.46s]  Is it a heart?
[7758.57s -> 7759.87s]  Playing the game and annoy people.
[7760.07s -> 7761.77s]  Well, I just said I wasn't going to do it.
[7763.70s -> 7765.70s]  This vote is a this vote doesn't mean anything to me.
[7772.93s -> 7773.63s]  What did you eat today?
[7774.23s -> 7780.16s]  I have one single cup of yogurt and a Sprite.
[7785.52s -> 7789.12s]  I had what?
[7789.12s -> 7790.82s]  Somebody said what?
[7796.46s -> 7799.26s]  It's like that is so shocking to hear that.
[7800.77s -> 7801.27s]  What?
[7803.24s -> 7804.44s]  Oh, yeah, guys are cranberries.
[7804.44s -> 7806.04s]  S tier for me mashed potatoes.
[7806.04s -> 7806.24s]  Great.
[7806.24s -> 7806.74s]  Oh man.
[7806.74s -> 7809.54s]  Oh, you know, God, we got this little butterball turkey.
[7809.54s -> 7810.64s]  Oh, it's so good.
[7810.64s -> 7811.24s]  What do you do?
[7811.24s -> 7812.74s]  Well, I had to go yogurt today.
[7812.84s -> 7813.24s]  That's it.
[7817.67s -> 7818.37s]  Nice spaghetti.
[7818.37s -> 7818.97s]  Liar.
[7827.42s -> 7828.02s]  Shit.
[7828.42s -> 7830.02s]  Do I only get one star for these?
[7830.52s -> 7832.42s]  But I was getting less stars.
[7837.59s -> 7839.39s]  Oh, clear the puzzle.
[7839.39s -> 7840.39s]  No misses.
[7840.39s -> 7841.19s]  No hints.
[7841.49s -> 7842.29s]  I'm getting two.
[7842.69s -> 7843.59s]  I could get up to three.
[7845.20s -> 7845.60s]  All right.
[7845.70s -> 7850.82s]  I got to get why lie viewers when you're eating spaghetti.
[7854.85s -> 7857.45s]  Because there's no actually spaghetti over here.
[7860.02s -> 7861.72s]  I think I can get this whole thing one.
[7862.62s -> 7864.02s]  So let me mark it.
[7866.88s -> 7870.28s]  It's one one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five.
[7870.28s -> 7870.58s]  Nope.
[7890.97s -> 7891.17s]  All right.
[7891.17s -> 7892.07s]  It's getting a little weird here.
[7892.07s -> 7892.67s]  One.
[7895.80s -> 7897.30s]  We did that seven now.
[7901.18s -> 7901.68s]  Reset it.
[7902.48s -> 7902.78s]  I don't care.
[7902.78s -> 7903.18s]  Reset.
[7907.06s -> 7908.26s]  I didn't mean to go that far.
[7911.40s -> 7913.10s]  Why would you lie about having spaghetti?
[7914.01s -> 7915.31s]  I don't know because I thought it was funny.
[7915.71s -> 7937.41s]  You're a cheater.
[7938.38s -> 7938.98s]  I'm not cheating.
[7945.10s -> 7946.00s]  Oh, that's a big raid.
[7947.16s -> 7949.36s]  Box box coming in with a monster raid.
[7951.01s -> 7951.61s]  What's going on?
[7953.02s -> 7954.02s]  Thanks for the raid box box.
[7954.02s -> 7954.62s]  Hope you're doing well.
[7955.96s -> 7957.56s]  Hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving coming over.
[7958.06s -> 7958.66s]  Celebrate it.
[7958.86s -> 7959.86s]  You as well box box.
[7961.56s -> 7961.86s]  Welcome.
[7961.86s -> 7962.56s]  We're playing pit cross.
[7962.56s -> 7966.36s]  We're just doing a chill night stream for two, three hours.
[7966.36s -> 7968.22s]  So hanging out.
[7969.54s -> 7969.94s]  Welcome.
[7970.04s -> 7970.54s]  Thanks a lot.
[7971.64s -> 7976.83s]  We're discussing our favorite Thanksgiving dinner items.
[7977.76s -> 7982.66s]  And what I said, I said that my favorite Thanksgiving item was
[7982.66s -> 7987.96s]  cranberry sauce in the can that you have to actually get like
[7989.44s -> 7991.54s]  and it splies out and hits the thing.
[7994.88s -> 7996.58s]  People thought that it was kind of weird, but that is one of
[7996.58s -> 7997.38s]  my favorite items.
[8001.13s -> 8001.63s]  But yeah, welcome.
[8001.63s -> 8003.13s]  Hope you had a good holiday.
[8003.53s -> 8004.43s]  Again, if you celebrate it.
[8011.83s -> 8012.83s]  I think I can do this.
[8013.23s -> 8014.24s]  It's one.
[8017.60s -> 8018.50s]  Oh, by the way, box box.
[8018.50s -> 8018.80s]  You got it.
[8018.80s -> 8019.60s]  You got to check out.
[8019.70s -> 8020.70s]  You got to check out pit cross.
[8021.10s -> 8021.40s]  All right.
[8024.56s -> 8029.29s]  It's like one of the most fun games ever cranberry sauce is
[8029.29s -> 8029.79s]  underrated.
[8032.14s -> 8033.64s]  He was eating yogurt spaghetti.
[8033.74s -> 8034.34s]  Don't lie.
[8036.09s -> 8036.59s]  Can I do this?
[8036.59s -> 8036.79s]  Let's see.
[8036.79s -> 8038.69s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[8039.19s -> 8041.38s]  Yeah, that's the whole line.
[8042.32s -> 8043.42s]  Now the whole thing opens up.
[8044.46s -> 8044.86s]  Oh, yeah.
[8052.19s -> 8052.59s]  Mm-hmm.
[8054.22s -> 8054.62s]  Mm-hmm.
[8055.65s -> 8056.15s]  Mm-hmm.
[8057.71s -> 8058.11s]  Mm-hmm.
[8058.89s -> 8059.19s]  Mm-hmm.
[8061.26s -> 8061.66s]  Mm-hmm.
[8063.30s -> 8063.70s]  Mm-hmm.
[8066.49s -> 8066.89s]  Mm-hmm.
[8068.39s -> 8068.69s]  Mm-hmm.
[8075.60s -> 8076.00s]  Mm-hmm.
[8077.47s -> 8077.87s]  Mm-hmm.
[8078.27s -> 8078.67s]  Mm-hmm.
[8080.27s -> 8080.67s]  I did it.
[8083.58s -> 8084.18s]  Satellite.
[8085.58s -> 8085.98s]  All right.
[8087.28s -> 8090.08s]  This is Miku pick Ross, which what that means is this is a
[8090.48s -> 8094.18s]  you've unlocked pictures and music from Miku.
[8094.18s -> 8096.68s]  If you're a Miku fan, I'm just a pick Ross fan.
[8101.76s -> 8104.06s]  I mean, I mean, it doesn't doesn't like Miku, right?
[8108.96s -> 8109.16s]  All right.
[8109.16s -> 8109.46s]  I thank you.
[8109.46s -> 8110.76s]  Do I have enough for another song?
[8114.78s -> 8114.98s]  All right.
[8114.98s -> 8115.98s]  I need one more level and I got it.
[8125.23s -> 8125.93s]  Dude, it's annoying.
[8125.93s -> 8139.56s]  All you do is eat spaghetti and lie a weird trait to have.
[8146.30s -> 8146.70s]  I don't know.
[8146.70s -> 8149.50s]  I feel like that's I don't know for some reason.
[8149.50s -> 8151.90s]  I feel like that's like a like a relationship thing.
[8152.60s -> 8154.60s]  Like you like we're like breaking up.
[8156.50s -> 8164.52s]  All you do is eat spaghetti and lie like what the fuck I feel
[8164.52s -> 8166.22s]  like what what is what is this?
[8180.46s -> 8188.98s]  This is part of the I don't want to go that actually I can
[8188.98s -> 8189.88s]  because it's a two there.
[8195.84s -> 8198.14s]  I might be going a little quick some people saying hey,
[8198.14s -> 8198.94s]  he's going really fast.
[8198.94s -> 8199.74s]  It's hard to keep up.
[8201.81s -> 8203.81s]  You you'll start to pick it up.
[8204.39s -> 8205.29s]  Once you get it, you get it.
[8209.14s -> 8209.74s]  There's only okay.
[8209.74s -> 8212.24s]  This is like a actual two out of three chance that I get this
[8212.24s -> 8212.84s]  right over here.
[8216.66s -> 8218.46s]  There's a 50-50 chance that it's either here or here.
[8218.76s -> 8222.74s]  I'm going to flip the coin heads.
[8247.90s -> 8248.30s]  It's okay.
[8253.22s -> 8254.42s]  Just don't make another mistake.
[8257.92s -> 8258.92s]  I need the stars.
[8270.39s -> 8271.49s]  So then it has to be down here.
[8272.33s -> 8280.09s]  I've reduced it to three, four, five, six, one, two, three,
[8280.09s -> 8280.99s]  four, five, six.
[8287.54s -> 8304.47s]  I can get this latest high.
[8307.42s -> 8316.05s]  I mean, yeah, I feel like it would be very difficult.
[8316.15s -> 8329.61s]  It's a five one.
[8336.45s -> 8337.15s]  This seven's done.
[8337.15s -> 8337.85s]  So it has to be here.
[8340.60s -> 8341.00s]  Very nice.
[8341.60s -> 8342.10s]  Very nice.
[8342.87s -> 8343.37s]  Very nice.
[8344.01s -> 8344.41s]  Wow.
[8345.12s -> 8346.42s]  Build it all in in one second.
[8347.38s -> 8348.68s]  You like it would be annoying high.
[8348.68s -> 8360.55s]  Yeah, but I would rather here's another thing too.
[8360.65s -> 8361.15s]  I made this.
[8361.25s -> 8362.15s]  I've talked about this before.
[8363.35s -> 8365.75s]  I don't want like, you know, doing drugs to be something
[8365.75s -> 8367.65s]  that's like, oh, I'm going to do that in stream.
[8367.65s -> 8368.35s]  Like isn't that funny?
[8368.35s -> 8369.05s]  Isn't that cool?
[8370.15s -> 8372.25s]  No, I thought about like stuff like that before, but it's
[8372.25s -> 8373.85s]  just I'd rather not.
[8374.45s -> 8375.35s]  I'm completely honest.
[8378.14s -> 8379.94s]  That's not to say like, oh, it would be like maybe be kind
[8379.94s -> 8380.34s]  of fun.
[8380.34s -> 8382.70s]  I just don't want I don't know.
[8382.98s -> 8385.18s]  I feel like I'd rather just not do that.
[8396.30s -> 8396.80s]  Liar.
[8399.17s -> 8400.67s]  You talk about it like every stream.
[8403.00s -> 8404.50s]  I definitely do not.
[8404.50s -> 8405.00s]  That is it.
[8405.50s -> 8414.94s]  That isn't an embellishment and don't get me wrong.
[8416.29s -> 8419.39s]  Like recreational marijuana, if it's legal where you are
[8419.39s -> 8422.29s]  and you, you know, safely doing it and you know, privacy
[8422.29s -> 8424.89s]  of your own home or among, you know, friends in a place
[8424.89s -> 8428.79s]  where it's safe and you're going to be, you know, safe
[8428.79s -> 8431.85s]  about it by all means, right?
[8433.52s -> 8435.52s]  But I don't know if I want to make it like content piece.
[8437.51s -> 8446.41s]  I think that's going another step forward because I mean,
[8446.71s -> 8451.75s]  so I mean, we all know that the famous clock fiasco, right?
[8451.75s -> 8457.77s]  The big clock scandal where I had been, you know, doing
[8457.77s -> 8460.67s]  marijuana because well, one of the main reasons why I
[8460.67s -> 8464.17s]  started taking in any amount of THC in the first place
[8464.17s -> 8465.47s]  was because the pain problem that I have.
[8466.27s -> 8469.84s]  So I wasn't like I was I mean, I didn't start really.
[8469.94s -> 8472.64s]  Oh, I'm going to just get high every single day.
[8472.64s -> 8474.54s]  That wasn't any ever what I want to do and that's not
[8474.54s -> 8475.24s]  what I do either.
[8476.44s -> 8481.32s]  But that like you can't I just can't do that anymore.
[8482.54s -> 8487.50s]  It was very clear that I can't read a clock and people
[8487.50s -> 8492.24s]  are going to know there's no way people are going to I'm
[8492.24s -> 8494.99s]  going to be able to hide that like I take a little bit
[8494.99s -> 8497.79s]  of THC and like relax and stream and I can't read an
[8497.79s -> 8499.49s]  analog clock and people go what time is it?
[8499.49s -> 8502.34s]  I'm like, I don't I don't know.
[8502.74s -> 8503.34s]  Like, what do you mean?
[8503.34s -> 8503.94s]  You don't know.
[8504.24s -> 8505.64s]  How is it possible?
[8506.71s -> 8508.61s]  How is it possible that you don't know that?
[8510.53s -> 8512.33s]  It's like, I don't know and then it's embarrassing
[8512.33s -> 8516.10s]  because I can't you said you lied lied about what being
[8516.20s -> 8517.10s]  high that day.
[8521.58s -> 8526.54s]  Did I say that was I actually high that day?
[8526.54s -> 8528.84s]  I thought I was I don't remember.
[8533.14s -> 8534.14s]  Did I make that up?
[8534.34s -> 8535.84s]  No, I don't think so.
[8536.04s -> 8537.44s]  Maybe I told you I made it up.
[8537.44s -> 8539.04s]  So you didn't think I was a moron.
[8540.36s -> 8540.56s]  I don't know.
[8540.56s -> 8541.66s]  There's something else going on there.
[8542.36s -> 8543.46s]  He's high right now.
[8549.28s -> 8554.72s]  He has dementia find the clip of me talking about it.
[8554.72s -> 8555.62s]  I'm actually curious.
[8558.96s -> 8560.96s]  I forget what the lie was.
[8563.66s -> 8568.17s]  What did um, there's a famous famous person.
[8568.17s -> 8568.87s]  What do they say?
[8569.67s -> 8572.37s]  They said as long as you have it's like tell the truth
[8572.37s -> 8575.66s]  always so you never have to remember anything who said
[8575.66s -> 8581.32s]  that like Mark Twain or something is like always tell
[8581.32s -> 8581.72s]  the truth.
[8581.72s -> 8586.41s]  So you never have to remember anything not Winston
[8586.41s -> 8586.71s]  Churchill.
[8586.71s -> 8595.23s]  I think it was Mark Twain Lady Gaga.
[8595.23s -> 8596.63s]  No, I think it was Mark Twain.
[8602.59s -> 8606.62s]  Fuck how deep does that lie go?
[8606.62s -> 8610.32s]  I wonder here's another problem.
[8611.10s -> 8612.70s]  I have real I have like kind of bad memory problems
[8612.70s -> 8613.20s]  anyways.
[8613.90s -> 8616.20s]  So I actually don't even remember if I was come on.
[8616.20s -> 8617.90s]  I don't remember if I was just fucking around or not.
[8618.30s -> 8620.00s]  Like when I said that that time that I told you I was
[8620.00s -> 8620.70s]  lying about it.
[8620.80s -> 8621.80s]  I might have just making it up.
[8622.50s -> 8623.00s]  I don't remember.
[8623.80s -> 8627.70s]  I actually don't remember it was Peewee Herman.
[8630.75s -> 8633.73s]  Is it this is just what this is a clip.
[8633.73s -> 8634.43s]  Why are you clipping this?
[8635.27s -> 8639.37s]  The left and right are numbers which indicate how many
[8639.37s -> 8642.07s]  cubes need to be filled in in that row or column for
[8642.07s -> 8645.07s]  instance, there has to be why did you just link this
[8645.07s -> 8645.37s]  to me?
[8646.37s -> 8647.97s]  This is just me explaining the game.
[8660.18s -> 8663.98s]  I think you said you were not I then later came clean
[8663.98s -> 8667.89s]  that you were I can't keep track of what the fuck
[8667.89s -> 8680.14s]  this guy ever says you lied about being high in the
[8680.14s -> 8681.74s]  concrete level not the clock.
[8681.74s -> 8682.94s]  I think that's correct.
[8684.13s -> 8685.13s]  That's what it was.
[8685.13s -> 8685.73s]  That's what it was.
[8685.73s -> 8686.03s]  Yep.
[8686.33s -> 8687.53s]  I think we're mixing it up a little bit.
[8687.53s -> 8689.03s]  So let me let me clear the air.
[8689.03s -> 8690.83s]  Let me get a clear picture of what happened.
[8691.53s -> 8695.83s]  So during the hitman 3 streams, I was walking around
[8695.83s -> 8697.53s]  on one of the levels where it's like I think it's
[8697.53s -> 8698.63s]  like the club or something, right?
[8698.73s -> 8701.53s]  It's a big concrete level and I did not know where
[8701.53s -> 8704.43s]  I was going and it was so frustrating and I was
[8704.43s -> 8707.63s]  getting so pissed off and so agitated by it and I
[8707.63s -> 8709.43s]  look I remember looking over at the chat and being
[8709.43s -> 8713.36s]  like people were saying this can't be for real.
[8713.56s -> 8715.06s]  He has to be under the influence.
[8715.06s -> 8716.66s]  There's no way a person could be like this.
[8716.66s -> 8717.76s]  I'm concerned about him.
[8718.56s -> 8720.56s]  I remember reading people saying I'm concerned
[8720.56s -> 8721.06s]  about this.
[8721.56s -> 8726.93s]  I'm very concerned about him and I was like fuck
[8727.13s -> 8728.43s]  I can't be this stupid.
[8729.13s -> 8730.83s]  I was like, oh, I guess the yeah, I guess the
[8730.83s -> 8732.33s]  edible started kicking in.
[8732.33s -> 8732.63s]  Yeah.
[8732.63s -> 8733.63s]  I remember I lied about that.
[8733.63s -> 8733.83s]  Yep.
[8733.83s -> 8734.43s]  Oh hundred percent.
[8736.98s -> 8737.58s]  That's what it was.
[8740.67s -> 8743.07s]  So I made it up that I oh, yeah guys.
[8743.67s -> 8745.07s]  I took a little bit before the stream.
[8745.07s -> 8748.47s]  It's like kicking in and everyone's like, oh, okay.
[8748.47s -> 8749.37s]  All right.
[8749.67s -> 8750.57s]  Now it makes sense.
[8750.77s -> 8752.37s]  All right, dude, do you you're good.
[8752.77s -> 8754.57s]  I'm sitting there going like fucking thank God
[8759.29s -> 8760.39s]  clock one was real.
[8760.49s -> 8765.43s]  It was I actually remember people writing in the
[8765.43s -> 8765.73s]  chat.
[8765.73s -> 8769.80s]  It was so just like man, I he's not pretending and
[8769.80s -> 8770.70s]  it's not even funny.
[8770.70s -> 8772.20s]  It's just like concerning that he doesn't know
[8772.20s -> 8772.80s]  where he is.
[8778.54s -> 8780.24s]  That's so funny in a way though.
[8781.70s -> 8784.90s]  I made up that I was high to make so you didn't
[8784.90s -> 8789.20s]  think I was like having like some type of problem.
[8790.46s -> 8792.36s]  Like I didn't want to never think I was stupid.
[8797.94s -> 8798.14s]  Yeah.
[8798.14s -> 8800.84s]  And then all right restart and then I can't I
[8800.84s -> 8803.44s]  came out later like months later.
[8803.44s -> 8803.94s]  That was like guys.
[8803.94s -> 8804.84s]  I made that up, right?
[8804.84s -> 8805.04s]  Okay.
[8805.04s -> 8807.34s]  So we are we're I we clear the air on this.
[8819.25s -> 8821.25s]  I gotta be careful because whoa, stop doing that.
[8821.25s -> 8822.25s]  I don't these are not guarantees.
[8822.25s -> 8823.15s]  This is a guarantee.
[8823.25s -> 8823.85s]  No, it's not.
[8824.73s -> 8825.63s]  How did I just get that?
[8832.93s -> 8834.43s]  Are there any lies you told on stream you haven't
[8834.43s -> 8835.23s]  come clean about?
[8836.42s -> 8838.82s]  I I don't I don't think so.
[8841.27s -> 8843.47s]  I mean, I kind of just I mess around a lot like
[8843.47s -> 8844.27s]  we all do here.
[8846.04s -> 8847.34s]  I mean this this plenty of opportunities where I
[8847.34s -> 8850.34s]  just kind of say just stuff just to make up a
[8850.34s -> 8851.44s]  scenario for fun.
[8851.84s -> 8852.34s]  Fuck.
[8852.74s -> 8854.14s]  No, I'm not going back.
[8860.33s -> 8861.83s]  I think it's clear when I do that though.
[8862.47s -> 8864.94s]  I think it's pretty set in stone that that's me
[8864.94s -> 8877.46s]  just messing around spaghetti and meatballs.
[8877.66s -> 8877.86s]  Yeah.
[8877.86s -> 8879.96s]  I mean, but did you honestly believe that was
[8879.96s -> 8880.36s]  real?
[8882.89s -> 8883.29s]  Come on.
[8883.29s -> 8905.77s]  When yes, it's like almost the whole screen
[8905.77s -> 8906.27s]  filled in.
[8910.34s -> 8914.49s]  What is this a chair?
[8923.53s -> 8924.63s]  Why would you lie about it?
[8927.65s -> 8931.12s]  No, because it's fun just to like make up fun
[8931.12s -> 8933.42s]  scenarios that just I don't know why why not?
[8933.42s -> 8934.02s]  It's fun.
[8938.33s -> 8939.23s]  Oh, I didn't even click on it.
[8954.47s -> 8955.37s]  Let you in here.
[8956.56s -> 8959.52s]  I did by the first song.
[8959.52s -> 8960.12s]  I've seen that a lot.
[8960.12s -> 8960.62s]  I'll do that.
[8968.79s -> 8970.09s]  What is the first song?
[8976.14s -> 8977.24s]  Which one of these is the first song?
[8984.67s -> 8987.77s]  Hey guys, did you know spaghetti and meatballs?
[8990.23s -> 8991.93s]  But you forgot about the laugh track right after
[8991.93s -> 8992.23s]  that.
[8996.90s -> 8998.20s]  That's just kind of funny what you said.
[8998.80s -> 8999.10s]  All right.
[8999.10s -> 9000.10s]  Where's the first song?
[9008.71s -> 9009.41s]  How was your Thanksgiving?
[9009.41s -> 9009.91s]  It was great.
[9025.37s -> 9027.67s]  That guy spammed spaghetti and meatballs dozens
[9027.67s -> 9028.37s]  of times.
[9032.26s -> 9037.43s]  No, did I just catch the spammer and I thought
[9037.43s -> 9038.83s]  it was with the way I said it about you?
[9038.83s -> 9039.33s]  Whatever.
[9039.63s -> 9039.93s]  All right.
[9039.93s -> 9041.53s]  What's the name of the song that you want me
[9041.53s -> 9042.13s]  to unlock?
[9049.86s -> 9051.46s]  I don't was it this one?
[9057.42s -> 9057.82s]  That's hard.
[9057.82s -> 9064.50s]  I can't it's hard for me to translate that which
[9064.50s -> 9070.55s]  one the one you were on the previous one the
[9070.55s -> 9077.86s]  previous one this one.
[9086.85s -> 9118.32s]  I'm trying to I can't read it this one chat
[9118.32s -> 9119.12s]  read it wrong.
[9121.21s -> 9123.54s]  I'll put it on and blast it.
[9123.54s -> 9125.14s]  Well, I'm not going to blast it, but I'll play
[9125.14s -> 9125.44s]  it.
[9134.87s -> 9135.57s]  Is it instrumental?
[9135.57s -> 9137.17s]  No, it's just one of the one I bought has
[9137.17s -> 9137.77s]  vocals, right?
[9149.98s -> 9150.68s]  Please don't blast it.
[9150.68s -> 9151.18s]  I have a headache.
[9151.18s -> 9155.38s]  No, I'm not gonna see how it is.
[9171.65s -> 9173.15s]  I think that's all I can do down here now.
[9176.71s -> 9177.81s]  So I can do this.
[9179.59s -> 9180.39s]  There we go.
[9186.73s -> 9202.36s]  This one this one's got this was this one's
[9224.43s -> 9225.23s]  top rows again.
[9228.02s -> 9235.72s]  You're up to one.
[9236.22s -> 9237.42s]  One down here is a two somewhere.
[9253.75s -> 9253.95s]  All right.
[9253.95s -> 9255.75s]  Hold on to do.
[9257.35s -> 9258.55s]  That's a one.
[9258.55s -> 9266.02s]  Okay, he's actually pretty good at Picross.
[9267.48s -> 9270.48s]  Oh when I'm just when I focus I've been playing
[9270.48s -> 9272.58s]  Picross for years for 10 years.
[9273.58s -> 9275.18s]  I remember the first Picross game that I ever
[9275.18s -> 9279.45s]  played I think was on the original DS the original
[9279.45s -> 9280.15s]  Nintendo DS.
[9281.60s -> 9282.80s]  So it's fun.
[9285.77s -> 9286.17s]  Now.
[9286.17s -> 9286.67s]  All right.
[9286.77s -> 9289.67s]  This is very beginner to intermediate stuff.
[9290.97s -> 9294.97s]  There's once you get into the 20 by 20 like 50
[9294.97s -> 9297.67s]  by 50 it gets really you have to pay a lot
[9297.67s -> 9298.97s]  attention to everything going on.
[9300.07s -> 9302.47s]  I don't know why my voice just did that but my
[9302.47s -> 9303.87s]  eyes were very confused by it.
[9307.05s -> 9308.05s]  Yeah, see 10 by 10.
[9308.79s -> 9309.79s]  This is all 10 by 10.
[9311.17s -> 9315.05s]  Then when I go over here 20 by 20, this is
[9315.05s -> 9319.61s]  obviously level 3 20 by 20 is pretty I'd say 15
[9319.61s -> 9322.68s]  by 15 is pretty standard 20 by 20 gets pretty
[9322.68s -> 9322.98s]  hard.
[9324.26s -> 9325.26s]  You were 20 by 20.
[9326.30s -> 9327.90s]  I'll I'll try 20 by 20.
[9328.51s -> 9331.34s]  Let's see if I can handle it and see everything
[9331.34s -> 9331.64s]  right.
[9332.52s -> 9332.72s]  All right.
[9332.72s -> 9334.22s]  So this is 20 by 20.
[9334.22s -> 9338.92s]  So therefore 15 16 17 18 so if teens that means
[9338.92s -> 9340.22s]  five has to be on each side.
[9345.89s -> 9348.79s]  There's this they get they get pretty wacky and
[9348.79s -> 9350.79s]  I tried 17 18.
[9357.87s -> 9362.87s]  Let me think if there's a 10 50 by 20 that means
[9362.87s -> 9376.60s]  that as long as there is and see can't do anything
[9376.60s -> 9378.50s]  in the middle really because there's no way to
[9378.50s -> 9379.60s]  know where it sits.
[9387.01s -> 9388.31s]  Really there's more I could get from here.
[9389.89s -> 9394.19s]  Can I let me tell you what 1 2 3 13 14 15 16
[9394.19s -> 9395.79s]  17 18 this 20 here.
[9395.79s -> 9403.22s]  1 2 3 4 5 15 16 17 18 9 is 19.
[9404.42s -> 9405.32s]  I think I got it though.
[9405.92s -> 9406.92s]  That's one.
[9407.42s -> 9409.52s]  There's only one slot that's not filled in here
[9409.52s -> 9410.62s]  and I don't know where it could be.
[9418.46s -> 9419.36s]  Let's be two in the middle.
[9419.36s -> 9428.60s]  1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I don't
[9428.60s -> 9432.37s]  think I can reliably fill these in but I guess
[9432.37s -> 9439.07s]  so because that means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 they both
[9439.07s -> 9439.77s]  could do that.
[9439.87s -> 9441.77s]  Although this is not something you would actually
[9441.77s -> 9442.07s]  know.
[9446.26s -> 9449.38s]  Are there any 20s like a whole row?
[9449.48s -> 9449.88s]  I need us.
[9449.98s -> 9455.63s]  I need an edge for 15.
[9455.63s -> 9457.43s]  I need an edge at least some kind of edge to
[9457.43s -> 9462.70s]  start yet.
[9463.10s -> 9477.04s]  Sorry restart part of the 10 this is part of the
[9477.04s -> 9477.54s]  9.
[9484.02s -> 9486.02s]  We said I just did the exact same thing.
[9487.51s -> 9499.52s]  Fill in the 7 10 3 4 5 6 7 space 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
[9501.45s -> 9506.76s]  I mean it could be so what like two out from each
[9506.76s -> 9507.16s]  side.
[9508.84s -> 9511.44s]  I don't know where the space though is but it has
[9511.44s -> 9514.64s]  to be like this and it has to be at least these
[9514.64s -> 9517.64s]  ones up here because I don't know where the space
[9517.64s -> 9517.94s]  is.
[9517.94s -> 9520.54s]  I am so annoyed whatever I'm going to leave it
[9522.51s -> 9523.91s]  because I don't know where the space is going to
[9523.91s -> 9526.31s]  be because it could be whatever I got it.
[9527.68s -> 9531.38s]  That's enough info to help you to have an oatmeal
[9531.38s -> 9531.58s]  brain.
[9531.58s -> 9534.36s]  I can't actually that's a lot of info though.
[9546.66s -> 9547.36s]  This is a good start.
[9553.79s -> 9554.29s]  Perfect.
[9554.79s -> 9555.49s]  Now.
[9555.49s -> 9556.89s]  I don't know anything about that.
[9566.18s -> 9580.42s]  Okay, what about the top row 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10?
[9584.73s -> 9588.33s]  Although I can fill in some of this though because
[9588.33s -> 9590.23s]  it's definitely in this row here.
[9590.23s -> 9591.53s]  I just don't know if it's this way.
[9593.06s -> 9593.96s]  It's definitely here.
[9597.05s -> 9598.55s]  That means the two has to be here then.
[9598.65s -> 9598.95s]  Yeah.
[9599.15s -> 9600.45s]  What do you mean the two is not there?
[9600.45s -> 9601.55s]  How is that possible?
[9601.55s -> 9601.95s]  What?
[9604.78s -> 9605.98s]  Oh shit.
[9607.48s -> 9609.68s]  When they get big like this, it's all right.
[9610.18s -> 9611.18s]  I just can't get three strikes.
[9626.94s -> 9631.24s]  I mean it has to be at least one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
[9636.34s -> 9637.14s]  Any more info?
[9640.26s -> 9659.19s]  Good 10 9 and 1.
[9660.47s -> 9662.27s]  Okay, this is part of a 2.
[9666.24s -> 9667.24s]  Well, here's the 12.
[9667.34s -> 9668.24s]  Can I do anything with 12?
[9668.74s -> 9673.11s]  Say 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.
[9676.55s -> 9680.75s]  Before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.
[9680.75s -> 9682.35s]  Okay, so it has to be like this.
[9684.97s -> 9685.67s]  One more, right?
[9692.68s -> 9693.78s]  Why are we yelling at each other?
[9695.99s -> 9697.59s]  Why are people screaming at each other?
[9700.23s -> 9701.73s]  Turn off the music.
[9704.62s -> 9707.22s]  I have to admit it has been a little distracting.
[9708.13s -> 9711.03s]  So if it's a little distracting for me, the person streaming,
[9711.83s -> 9715.03s]  then some of you guys must must be unbearable for some of you.
[9719.43s -> 9720.83s]  I can't turn it off from here.
[9722.63s -> 9723.43s]  I don't want to give up.
[9734.58s -> 9735.08s]  Turn it up.
[9735.18s -> 9736.38s]  No, I'm not going to turn it up.
[9739.84s -> 9741.04s]  I'm getting closer.
[9741.14s -> 9742.44s]  So not much longer.
[9764.42s -> 9766.52s]  I love Miku.
[9766.82s -> 9767.92s]  I do Miku's great.
[9768.32s -> 9771.02s]  But I think we're going to put on a different song.
[9772.08s -> 9773.08s]  Can we streamer's choice?
[9801.47s -> 9803.57s]  I don't know why I wanted to listen to this for one second.
[9803.57s -> 9805.67s]  This is worse because it's probably really copywritten.
[9811.69s -> 9812.29s]  That's not the one.
[9812.39s -> 9812.89s]  Never mind.
[9825.76s -> 9826.36s]  Where's Miku?
[9830.63s -> 9831.53s]  Austin Powers.
[9831.63s -> 9832.53s]  We did that already.
[9841.90s -> 9844.00s]  Oh, I could just play Miku songs that I like.
[9846.37s -> 9846.87s]  Holy shit.
[9846.87s -> 9847.97s]  That's actually true.
[9867.54s -> 9871.79s]  Okay, is this the right version?
[9871.79s -> 9872.79s]  Is there more than one version?
[9881.34s -> 9882.24s]  I guess it was the one.
[9884.09s -> 9885.79s]  Probably here, but I'm afraid to get three strikes.
[9909.48s -> 9909.98s]  Nice.
[9912.35s -> 9913.75s]  That was risky, but it was worth it.
[9920.08s -> 9924.36s]  2 3 4 5 6 7.
[9925.19s -> 9926.09s]  Part of the 10.
[9926.29s -> 9941.96s]  You need to sing it.
[9942.76s -> 9953.94s]  All right, this is 11.
[9955.31s -> 9955.51s]  All right.
[9955.51s -> 9956.11s]  So that was fun.
[9959.25s -> 9959.85s]  What else should I do?
[9964.02s -> 9965.82s]  Are both songs playing right now?
[9966.22s -> 9966.62s]  I don't think so.
[9966.62s -> 9966.92s]  I turned it.
[9966.92s -> 9967.12s]  I should.
[9967.12s -> 9967.62s]  I turned it on.
[9979.78s -> 9983.48s]  People saying play triple, triple baka, triple baka.
[9985.01s -> 9985.41s]  Okay.
[9993.25s -> 9993.65s]  Yes.
[9993.65s -> 9994.05s]  Yes.
[9994.05s -> 9994.65s]  Yes.
[9994.65s -> 9995.45s]  Have I ever heard this?
[10017.92s -> 10018.62s]  Seven.
[10022.36s -> 10023.16s]  Where's the two go?
[10023.36s -> 10024.06s]  Okay, this one a half.
[10024.16s -> 10025.66s]  This is one, two.
[10027.26s -> 10028.06s]  Oh, it has to be this way.
[10029.26s -> 10037.47s]  All these need to be filled in.
[10039.54s -> 10040.74s]  Is the, yeah, this is nine.
[10041.54s -> 10042.54s]  This is no, this is not five.
[10042.54s -> 10042.74s]  Right?
[10042.74s -> 10049.66s]  One, eight, nine, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three,
[10049.66s -> 10058.48s]  four, five, people, people, people, people, people.
[10063.78s -> 10080.30s]  That's this is definitely part of the seven.
[10091.72s -> 10092.02s]  Right?
[10092.12s -> 10092.32s]  Yeah.
[10093.62s -> 10109.51s]  Well, I would imagine this is probably the four, but I can't deduce
[10109.51s -> 10110.61s]  that, but I'm going to go for it.
[10145.41s -> 10146.11s]  It's three strikes.
[10156.91s -> 10161.76s]  I got too comfortable that I'm going to finish it.
[10161.86s -> 10162.36s]  I'll finish it.
[10162.36s -> 10162.86s]  I'll finish it.
[10164.44s -> 10164.84s]  Shit.
[10165.04s -> 10166.04s]  I'm not going to get any points with this.
[10180.17s -> 10182.87s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[10183.57s -> 10186.27s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[10193.21s -> 10194.31s]  Still don't know what side it's on.
[10195.31s -> 10195.71s]  Do I?
[10196.81s -> 10197.51s]  I do.
[10201.88s -> 10202.78s]  What happened?
[10203.08s -> 10203.58s]  What'd I do?
[10203.58s -> 10204.08s]  What happened?
[10204.18s -> 10204.88s]  What'd I do wrong?
[10207.07s -> 10207.77s]  Where's the one?
[10208.27s -> 10208.57s]  What?
[10208.57s -> 10209.07s]  Hold on.
[10212.76s -> 10213.36s]  It's here.
[10214.44s -> 10215.34s]  Oh no.
[10217.53s -> 10218.13s]  That's bad.
[10223.85s -> 10224.75s]  I can't reset.
[10224.75s -> 10225.45s]  No, I can't.
[10225.45s -> 10226.25s]  I've been doing it for too long.
[10228.10s -> 10233.06s]  That's why it these 20 by 20 is it just they take a lot of you
[10233.06s -> 10235.46s]  just have to remember you just can't just go fast.
[10236.06s -> 10236.46s]  That's all right.
[10238.18s -> 10238.98s]  Any more requests?
[10242.32s -> 10243.52s]  I'll take any requests by the way.
[10243.52s -> 10245.82s]  It doesn't just have to be Miku long as it's not going to get the
[10245.82s -> 10246.52s]  channel turned off.
[10249.73s -> 10510.50s]  Like the world is mine made like 15 mistakes.
[10514.78s -> 10514.98s]  All right.
[10514.98s -> 10515.28s]  What was it?
[10515.28s -> 10515.48s]  What was it?
[10515.48s -> 10516.38s]  Somebody said I have a request.
[10516.38s -> 10516.78s]  What was it?
[10523.71s -> 10536.44s]  This one rolling girl, is it right?
[10543.18s -> 10544.48s]  How come these aren't in this game?
[10547.81s -> 10550.81s]  I don't want to miss you know, I don't want to misrepresent this
[10550.81s -> 10551.31s]  game.
[10551.41s -> 10552.51s]  This is these are not in the game.
[10553.01s -> 10554.11s]  I'm playing them on YouTube.
[10555.33s -> 10560.87s]  I wonder why would they wouldn't be in game probably licensing
[10560.87s -> 10561.37s]  problem.
[10563.56s -> 10565.84s]  I made this game.
[10566.44s -> 10570.44s]  Isn't it Sega doesn't Sega own this stuff who made this Sega
[10570.44s -> 10571.04s]  not make this?
[10578.10s -> 10578.70s]  Probably not.
[10580.72s -> 10581.32s]  That was fun.
[10581.32s -> 10584.59s]  I'm going to go back to some easier ones.
[10586.23s -> 10588.53s]  I want to least clear this second row here the second one.
[10597.43s -> 10598.73s]  Okay, how's the volume good?
[10627.53s -> 10632.10s]  I love when this happens, you know, it can't be anywhere over
[10632.10s -> 10632.40s]  here.
[10633.30s -> 10634.70s]  It helps free up a lot of space.
[10635.70s -> 10645.55s]  Usually 234 23.
[10645.75s -> 10645.95s]  All right.
[10645.95s -> 10648.15s]  Well, I mean, I know it's here and I know it's like here.
[10672.24s -> 10672.84s]  Like magnet.
[10683.18s -> 10684.48s]  I feel like I can get this.
[10685.38s -> 10685.68s]  Yeah.
[10695.64s -> 10697.84s]  Oh interesting one.
[10716.43s -> 10716.93s]  Huh?
[10717.33s -> 10719.44s]  Oh, I thought that was part of the
[10719.94s -> 10721.14s]  I just wasn't looking down shit.
[10721.14s -> 10721.44s]  Come on.
[10721.44s -> 10722.54s]  I can't make those kind of mistakes.
[10722.54s -> 10724.27s]  That's the rookie mistake.
[10731.17s -> 10731.67s]  This is different.
[10746.51s -> 10747.31s]  Oh, I already heard this one.
[10751.73s -> 10761.54s]  L polka polka was it live and polka.
[10782.92s -> 10784.12s]  Oh, it's this one.
[10784.12s -> 10786.00s]  I know this one.
[10786.10s -> 10786.70s]  I know this one.
[10796.35s -> 10807.23s]  This is this is a classic song after I feel this wrong and
[10807.23s -> 10808.13s]  see what the special puzzle is.
[10826.81s -> 10827.81s]  Seven eight nine.
[10828.79s -> 10829.79s]  This I could do these two.
[10832.98s -> 10834.48s]  It's yes.
[10842.59s -> 10844.79s]  One two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[10847.46s -> 10848.56s]  Yo, what?
[10849.86s -> 10850.26s]  Yo.
[10855.69s -> 10856.79s]  So this is part of the three.
[10856.79s -> 10858.69s]  Then we know one, two, three.
[10858.69s -> 10859.89s]  It cannot be down here.
[10868.58s -> 10870.28s]  I mean, maybe it does a little because it's either it's either
[10870.28s -> 10873.48s]  one, two, three, four or it's here.
[10873.88s -> 10874.78s]  So I just go for it.
[10876.92s -> 10877.82s]  I just go for it over here.
[10878.82s -> 10882.72s]  It's on it's either over here or it's right here.
[10899.79s -> 10900.29s]  I'm going for it.
[10912.36s -> 10913.76s]  You can call me a cheater if you want, but I got one.
[10913.76s -> 10931.24s]  I mean, what is this?
[10934.92s -> 10935.62s]  What the hell is that?
[10935.72s -> 10936.22s]  This is different.
[10936.32s -> 10937.22s]  This is a different artist.
[10944.05s -> 10944.45s]  Play it.
[10953.50s -> 10953.80s]  Play it.
[10953.80s -> 10954.20s]  Play it.
[10954.96s -> 10955.46s]  Turn it off.
[10955.76s -> 10956.06s]  Play it.
[10957.19s -> 10960.63s]  This is called Kikuo.
[10961.33s -> 10962.63s]  Kikuo love me.
[10962.83s -> 10963.23s]  Love me.
[10963.23s -> 10963.73s]  Love me.
[10964.53s -> 10967.10s]  This is a different artist.
[10988.10s -> 10989.80s]  This actually helps because now it's one.
[11000.68s -> 11001.28s]  Don't tell him.
[11004.05s -> 11004.85s]  Play time machine.
[11007.62s -> 11008.32s]  Time machine.
[11019.08s -> 11019.98s]  I said fuck you.
[11020.38s -> 11020.78s]  What?
[11031.23s -> 11031.83s]  What the fuck?
[11031.93s -> 11032.33s]  What?
[11035.37s -> 11036.37s]  That was a bonus track.
[11036.37s -> 11037.57s]  We weren't supposed to even hear that one.
[11062.68s -> 11063.38s]  How do you do Donald Duck?
[11067.28s -> 11067.98s]  Something like that, right?
[11067.98s -> 11074.14s]  You go like I'm stumped.
[11077.22s -> 11078.22s]  It's definitely this row.
[11078.62s -> 11080.42s]  This row or this one has the most info.
[11080.42s -> 11081.72s]  One, two, three, four.
[11082.52s -> 11089.03s]  This is a one.
[11089.03s -> 11089.73s]  That's a one.
[11089.73s -> 11089.83s]  All right.
[11089.83s -> 11092.03s]  This is two after this.
[11094.54s -> 11095.84s]  Why is everyone so angry?
[11096.44s -> 11097.24s]  You're cringe.
[11108.50s -> 11109.40s]  You skipped a good song.
[11109.50s -> 11110.20s]  I didn't skip it.
[11110.20s -> 11111.20s]  We listened to half of it.
[11129.58s -> 11130.78s]  Go back, liar.
[11130.88s -> 11131.88s]  We listened to half of it.
[11145.62s -> 11146.72s]  I think this actually helps here.
[11148.55s -> 11148.95s]  It does.
[11151.07s -> 11152.07s]  Okay, so I can do that.
[11152.87s -> 11154.27s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[11154.37s -> 11155.67s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[11155.67s -> 11156.77s]  That's all I can do.
[11157.47s -> 11158.47s]  But this is three.
[11161.24s -> 11162.04s]  That's cool.
[11163.68s -> 11164.38s]  Helps a little.
[11177.48s -> 11178.38s]  I'm going to unfollow.
[11178.98s -> 11179.48s]  Why?
[11179.48s -> 11181.78s]  Because I skipped a song.
[11183.20s -> 11184.60s]  Here, I'll put a streamer's choice on.
[11220.46s -> 11220.76s]  There.
[11220.86s -> 11222.16s]  I'll put a streamer's choice on for a bit.
[11243.79s -> 11247.21s]  Somebody said, bro, relax.
[11261.25s -> 11261.85s]  I'm going for it.
[11262.33s -> 11262.83s]  Yes.
[11266.11s -> 11266.91s]  This is the never video.
[11293.18s -> 11294.08s]  This actually goes.
[11294.18s -> 11294.78s]  It does, yeah.
[11296.32s -> 11297.92s]  This way, I'm going to, we'll keep this on for a little bit.
[11297.92s -> 11300.32s]  Those of you that have not heard this before, it's a great soundtrack.
[11301.12s -> 11303.66s]  It's by Terry Scott Taylor.
[11319.58s -> 11320.08s]  Pretty good.
[11321.38s -> 11322.38s]  Really nostalgic.
[11322.58s -> 11323.58s]  Nostalgic.
[11323.68s -> 11324.28s]  Can't even say it.
[11325.42s -> 11326.72s]  Now we turn this up, of course.
[11326.72s -> 11328.42s]  Oh, you don't think we're going to turn this up all the way?
[11360.62s -> 11361.82s]  This is not Miku.
[11366.03s -> 11367.13s]  Yeah, I'm playing.
[11367.13s -> 11368.83s]  Oh, yeah, it's Hatsune Miku.
[11368.83s -> 11370.63s]  The game where you do Picross.
[11370.93s -> 11373.13s]  Of course, the soundtrack is going to be very important.
[11374.39s -> 11375.59s]  This is incredibly important.
[11388.91s -> 11389.21s]  Let me see.
[11389.21s -> 11390.11s]  What should I put on?
[11393.86s -> 11395.26s]  Oh, yeah, this one.
[11399.88s -> 11400.28s]  Let's go.
[11411.70s -> 11412.20s]  This way.
[11418.02s -> 11420.12s]  Dude, this guy fucking loves the saxophone.
[11427.47s -> 11428.17s]  It's great.
[11431.26s -> 11432.26s]  This whole game has a vibe.
[11441.86s -> 11442.66s]  This one's tricky.
[11446.99s -> 11448.39s]  I feel like it kind of has to wait.
[11449.39s -> 11450.09s]  I don't know.
[11451.22s -> 11453.25s]  I really don't know.
[11453.45s -> 11454.05s]  I know that.
[11466.79s -> 11467.09s]  Yeah.
[11467.09s -> 11468.29s]  Hey, why don't you fucking take it?
[11468.76s -> 11469.46s]  Sit down for this one.
[11471.08s -> 11471.88s]  Sit down for this one.
[11473.59s -> 11475.19s]  This one goes super hard.
[11495.28s -> 11495.88s]  This dude loves...
[11495.88s -> 11496.38s]  I do.
[11496.48s -> 11496.78s]  All right.
[11496.78s -> 11498.68s]  I like the saxophone.
[11498.78s -> 11499.48s]  It's a fucking...
[11499.68s -> 11501.18s]  It's an unbelievable instrument.
[11504.66s -> 11505.46s]  And plus it's like...
[11505.86s -> 11506.16s]  What do you mean?
[11506.16s -> 11506.96s]  It's an oboe.
[11508.26s -> 11509.16s]  This is an oboe.
[11540.56s -> 11543.06s]  Oh, now it's just cascades.
[11543.66s -> 11573.42s]  All right.
[11573.42s -> 11574.72s]  Now we bring everything together.
[11575.22s -> 11575.92s]  Here we go.
[11595.90s -> 11596.60s]  This goes hard.
[11596.60s -> 11597.40s]  Of course it does.
[11600.61s -> 11601.51s]  This whole soundtrack is...
[11602.11s -> 11604.81s]  This is the best soundtrack of any video game that is ever released.
[11605.65s -> 11606.65s]  I genuinely mean that.
[11606.65s -> 11607.45s]  I really believe that.
[11614.13s -> 11615.13s]  See how you guys feel about this one.
[11618.02s -> 11619.22s]  This one's a great one.
[11619.22s -> 11620.22s]  You guys are going to love this one.
[11636.57s -> 11637.87s]  This one's pretty topical today.
[11640.56s -> 11640.86s]  What is this?
[11640.86s -> 11642.16s]  This is the Neverhood soundtrack.
[11643.16s -> 11644.66s]  The OST for the Neverhood.
[11645.06s -> 11646.06s]  By Terry Scott Tello.
[11679.26s -> 11681.16s]  This is the shit that would play when you were doing a puzzle.
[11682.18s -> 11683.38s]  They just added to the whole thing.
[11689.58s -> 11689.88s]  Are you going to...
[11689.88s -> 11690.38s]  Yeah.
[11693.71s -> 11696.41s]  Is this what you play when you play your iPad games?
[11700.16s -> 11700.96s]  Oh, this one's good too.
[11706.21s -> 11706.91s]  This one's really good.
[11729.98s -> 11730.48s]  What?
[11730.48s -> 11731.18s]  Oh, fuck.
[11737.62s -> 11739.32s]  This chill Thanksgiving vibes.
[11739.32s -> 11739.72s]  Come on.
[11740.02s -> 11770.64s]  That's the three, right?
[11770.94s -> 11771.84s]  No, it's the four.
[11773.63s -> 11775.33s]  Oh, I'm such an idiot.
[11783.64s -> 11784.24s]  What else we got?
[11792.32s -> 11793.52s]  Do I have to play the...
[11793.62s -> 11793.92s]  Come on.
[11793.92s -> 11795.32s]  I do this like every like a year or two.
[11799.86s -> 11801.86s]  In the sequel to the Neverhood, there was a...
[11802.16s -> 11802.96s]  It was a bonus room.
[11802.96s -> 11803.96s]  It was called Skullmonkeys.
[11804.54s -> 11813.60s]  So there was a bonus room in the sequel to the Neverhood where you go in it and they sing you a song.
[11816.22s -> 11818.22s]  And this is the song that plays when you're in the bonus room.
[11819.06s -> 11822.46s]  It's been the inspiration for a lot of music in the video game world.
[11823.16s -> 11824.96s]  If you didn't know, look it up.
[11826.58s -> 11826.98s]  Here it is.
[11850.51s -> 11851.41s]  You don't.
[11881.63s -> 11885.45s]  And a little like your mom.
[11885.55s -> 11888.35s]  There are no monsters here.
[11888.45s -> 11890.95s]  Hey, wait, look over there.
[11893.55s -> 11895.35s]  I was just kidding.
[11897.40s -> 11898.60s]  Be scared.
[11899.20s -> 11910.40s]  And when you turn this game off in the real world once again, you won't have to play Make Me Leave, but try to pretend.
[11910.90s -> 11915.40s]  Because I'll be right there when you open your...
[11915.50s -> 11916.00s]  Is this too loud?
[11916.00s -> 11916.80s]  Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[11916.80s -> 11921.70s]  Because I'm your little invisible musical friend.
[11922.20s -> 11927.50s]  So show me to your pets or show me to your pals.
[11927.90s -> 11933.10s]  You really will impress every nifty guy and gal.
[11933.60s -> 11935.70s]  Show them you're individual.
[11936.20s -> 11938.50s]  Show them you are bold.
[11938.90s -> 11945.30s]  Besides, I get residuals for every game that's sold.
[11946.00s -> 11952.50s]  I'm your little invisible musical friend.
[11954.52s -> 11957.32s]  Somebody said when Jerma gets the aux cord.
[11962.24s -> 11966.84s]  So that plays when you're in a bonus and it was funny and it was like weird and people thought it was like, what the fuck is happening?
[11966.84s -> 11968.04s]  It was like a secret room.
[11971.44s -> 11971.84s]  There you go.
[11975.20s -> 11976.50s]  All right, we're doing streamers choice again.
[11980.12s -> 11981.52s]  What should I play for streamers choice?
[11993.44s -> 11993.84s]  I got one.
[11999.02s -> 11999.52s]  This is a good one.
[12003.72s -> 12005.12s]  I don't think people are going to be upset about this one.
[12029.10s -> 12030.20s]  All right, I got to pay attention now.
[12030.40s -> 12031.86s]  So three could be here.
[12033.12s -> 12034.92s]  It's probably there and it is.
[12038.97s -> 12042.67s]  Now the real question is there is a two and a one hanging out here.
[12042.67s -> 12043.57s]  There's also a three.
[12047.98s -> 12049.28s]  Ah, I took a guess.
[12049.28s -> 12050.28s]  I just wanted to get it done.
[12052.02s -> 12054.12s]  If I had put the marker there, I wouldn't know it wasn't there.
[12058.30s -> 12059.10s]  That's three strikes.
[12059.20s -> 12059.60s]  Shit.
[12061.72s -> 12066.42s]  This is Superstar Saga the battle music or the Game Boy Advance, I believe.
[12081.00s -> 12097.36s]  One, two, yoko Shimomura.
[12097.36s -> 12102.57s]  Yep, I think Yoko Shimomura might be probably one of the best.
[12103.58s -> 12106.68s]  I think the best that ever was.
[12106.68s -> 12114.36s]  I think so many soundtracks by Yoko Shimomura were, I mean, they're just unbeatable.
[12116.47s -> 12120.07s]  I don't understand how it's possible to have that many 10 out of 10
[12120.07s -> 12122.67s]  soundtracks in a row every time.
[12125.19s -> 12131.39s]  I don't understand because it's not just one or two.
[12132.19s -> 12133.69s]  It's all of them.
[12134.68s -> 12135.98s]  Every single one of them.
[12139.87s -> 12144.05s]  Being that talented and being that connected to music and stuff.
[12144.05s -> 12145.55s]  It's just, it's just unbelievable.
[12145.55s -> 12146.05s]  It really is.
[12155.82s -> 12157.12s]  Redditor music taste?
[12157.82s -> 12158.72s]  I don't know.
[12159.72s -> 12160.42s]  I could, all right.
[12160.42s -> 12161.22s]  That's bait.
[12161.86s -> 12163.16s]  That's bait I was about to take.
[12163.16s -> 12164.96s]  I was about to just eat the onion there.
[12166.14s -> 12166.94s]  I was about to eat the onion.
[12167.34s -> 12167.64s]  All right.
[12167.74s -> 12168.24s]  Nevermind.
[12170.62s -> 12170.92s]  All right.
[12170.92s -> 12171.42s]  Chat's choice.
[12171.42s -> 12171.82s]  What do you want?
[12178.57s -> 12179.07s]  Chat's choice.
[12182.62s -> 12183.22s]  Will Miku?
[12183.22s -> 12183.42s]  All right.
[12183.42s -> 12184.22s]  Well, give me a Miku song.
[12193.96s -> 12194.46s]  Magnet.
[12194.46s -> 12194.86s]  That was one.
[12194.86s -> 12196.06s]  Yeah, I remember seeing that earlier.
[12196.96s -> 12197.46s]  Magnet.
[12207.36s -> 12207.86s]  Is this correct?
[12445.51s -> 12445.61s]  All right.
[12445.61s -> 12448.11s]  What's some other music that I want to show you?
[12459.40s -> 12459.90s]  Hmm.
[12461.88s -> 12462.58s]  Do more Neverhood.
[12473.38s -> 12478.85s]  I was going to play the Avengers theme because I wanted to have the mods.
[12478.85s -> 12481.45s]  I was going to say in private to count how many bad chest there were.
[12484.30s -> 12487.08s]  People already started doing it, but my joke is ruined.
[12487.58s -> 12488.18s]  What should I play?
[12496.31s -> 12497.01s]  I guess we're doing this.
[12509.85s -> 12510.95s]  I feel like it's right here.
[12511.15s -> 12511.45s]  Yeah.
[12515.55s -> 12516.35s]  One, two, three.
[12516.35s -> 12517.35s]  One, two, three.
[12528.92s -> 12529.92s]  My favorite gorilla song.
[12530.02s -> 12531.42s]  Um, it used to be Stylo.
[12545.06s -> 12545.86s]  Stylo is...
[12546.46s -> 12547.16s]  I just like the beat.
[12561.92s -> 12562.72s]  Stylo slaps.
[12562.72s -> 12562.92s]  Yeah.
[12562.92s -> 12563.62s]  I'll put it on after this.
[12565.99s -> 12567.09s]  You guys get mad if I put it on now.
[12574.75s -> 12577.35s]  This stream is definitely not going to be up anymore.
[12577.45s -> 12579.15s]  It's going to get dropped in a second.
[12586.11s -> 12586.31s]  Bye.
[12586.31s -> 12587.01s]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[12587.11s -> 12587.61s]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[12587.61s -> 12588.01s]  Thanks for coming.
[12589.16s -> 12589.76s]  Thanks for chilling.
[12593.26s -> 12596.36s]  And again, like I said before, I want to start doing more of these
[12596.76s -> 12597.86s]  streams that we just kind of chilled.
[12598.66s -> 12599.26s]  Put on some music.
[12600.85s -> 12602.45s]  Do something just simple.
[12603.25s -> 12603.85s]  Hang out for a little bit.
[12609.15s -> 12609.95s]  I like these a lot.
[12625.17s -> 12625.57s]  Does this help?
[12625.77s -> 12625.97s]  Good.
[12628.35s -> 12629.05s]  Talk about spaghetti.
[12629.75s -> 12630.45s]  I love spaghetti.
[12648.78s -> 12649.48s]  Okay, good.
[12656.46s -> 12657.26s]  This is also six.
[12657.26s -> 12657.66s]  Hold on.
[12666.15s -> 12666.75s]  That's okay.
[12682.35s -> 12683.45s]  One, two, three, four.
[12686.17s -> 12686.87s]  Two.
[12688.04s -> 12689.64s]  One, two, four.
[12689.64s -> 12690.64s]  One, two, three, four.
[12703.30s -> 12703.90s]  Six.
[12704.30s -> 12705.00s]  Is this six here?
[12705.00s -> 12705.30s]  Yep.
[12714.08s -> 12714.48s]  Sweet.
[12718.52s -> 12718.82s]  All right.
[12718.92s -> 12719.32s]  No mistakes.
[12719.32s -> 12719.62s]  Good.
[12720.60s -> 12721.20s]  That's what I like to see.
[12733.89s -> 12734.19s]  All right.
[12734.39s -> 12734.79s]  What's it going to do?
[12734.79s -> 12735.19s]  Oh, yes.
[12735.19s -> 12735.59s]  Stylo.
[12742.13s -> 12742.63s]  It's almost over.
[12742.63s -> 12743.33s]  I won't stop it.
[12745.93s -> 12746.43s]  It's almost over.
[12764.61s -> 12765.01s]  Here we go.
[12767.92s -> 12770.22s]  This is one of my favorite songs on the album.
[12771.12s -> 12772.62s]  This thing is, this is sick.
[13036.76s -> 13037.26s]  No, I was typing.
[13037.26s -> 13038.56s]  Do you hear how fast I was typing?
[13038.56s -> 13039.46s]  What just happened?
[13039.46s -> 13040.46s]  I typed three words.
[13042.19s -> 13043.49s]  I typed three words.
[13043.49s -> 13044.59s]  Why did that take so long?
[13045.38s -> 13046.78s]  Oh, we keep this one on too, by the way.
[13050.90s -> 13273.08s]  But if you guys like these, you know, start streaming around like
[13273.48s -> 13274.58s]  six or seven p.m.
[13274.58s -> 13275.08s]  Pacific.
[13275.71s -> 13276.81s]  Stream for a few hours.
[13276.91s -> 13277.71s]  Do it every so often.
[13280.43s -> 13281.43s]  A little bit lower energy.
[13282.33s -> 13282.83s]  Hang out.
[13283.37s -> 13284.67s]  I actually like it a lot.
[13288.93s -> 13292.03s]  Now, there were some high-energy moments today, but that's just the way it is.
[13292.43s -> 13293.73s]  I can't stop that.
[13295.62s -> 13297.82s]  What's the ultimate Miku song to play right now?
[13308.21s -> 13309.21s]  The Miku song?
[13314.59s -> 13316.09s]  Intense voice.
[13321.05s -> 13321.35s]  Okay.
[13344.81s -> 13345.51s]  I already did this one.
[13346.21s -> 13346.51s]  Today?
[13358.94s -> 13359.44s]  I don't think so.
[13362.03s -> 13363.43s]  What's the one where, uh...
[13369.27s -> 13369.97s]  What's the one that...
[13372.86s -> 13373.46s]  I forget what it was.
[13375.80s -> 13376.20s]  Play...
[13376.50s -> 13377.00s]  Ma...
[13377.60s -> 13378.10s]  I'll play that one now.
[13378.80s -> 13379.40s]  We'll do two more.
[13380.20s -> 13381.00s]  Don't worry, we're queuing it up.
[13388.93s -> 13390.33s]  I got, we got time for two more.
[13402.38s -> 13403.68s]  One, two, three, okay.
[13408.56s -> 13409.16s]  Then nine, ten.
[13417.20s -> 13418.10s]  What's the other one that's like this?
[13419.73s -> 13420.23s]  It's like
[13430.43s -> 13430.93s]  Yeah, it's like
[13439.90s -> 13440.70s]  All right, this one's a little...
[13441.10s -> 13441.80s]  This one's crazy.
[13456.46s -> 13457.46s]  Wrench in, wrench in now.
[13457.96s -> 13458.42s]  All right.
[13471.81s -> 13473.07s]  Oh my God.
[13476.06s -> 13484.47s]  Okay.
[13484.61s -> 13530.57s]  This is the one?
[13530.71s -> 13531.11s]  That one's, uh...
[13531.11s -> 13531.81s]  That one's a little much.
[13532.21s -> 13532.77s]  That one's crazy.
[13533.38s -> 13533.78s]  Um...
[13534.91s -> 13535.77s]  I just wanted to hear the beginning.
[13535.77s -> 13542.14s]  Just wanted to hear the very beginning. That's all I wanted to hear. All right. We need we need one to go out on
[13542.14s -> 13603.75s]  I got one to go out on. How about this one? What do you think? Should we play it again?
[13603.79s -> 13630.86s]  Give me just something random. Give me something random. There's something that's just completely out of left field peaches
[13631.34s -> 13640.26s]  Wow, holy smokes. Wow that you just brought back me
[13640.26s -> 13649.90s]  You just brought me back like 15 years really Wow. I
[13652.54s -> 13654.54s]  Completely forgot about this song and this band
[13655.22s -> 13660.98s]  Alright, let's get out of with this one
[13673.67s -> 13676.30s]  Then it goes look out
[13699.13s -> 13705.52s]  I'm moving to the country. I'm going to eat a lot of peaches
[13706.40s -> 13710.56s]  Moving to the country. I'm going to eat a lot of peaches
[13711.40s -> 13715.28s]  Moving to the country. I'm going to eat a lot of peaches
[13716.04s -> 13718.04s]  Something's done here
[13727.91s -> 13729.91s]  Can't be here
[13735.27s -> 13747.22s]  Is that millions of peaches peaches for free
[13769.86s -> 13771.86s]  That
[13772.14s -> 13814.70s]  This was a D song back in the day they're like fighting in this music video. Well, this is why I don't know
[13814.70s -> 13838.94s]  We're not doing this one. I don't know about this one. Cool. All right. I'm already doing it
[13838.94s -> 13859.82s]  So I'm already doing it. So what we knew one more. All right. Let me play the one that everyone's been requesting
[13859.82s -> 13874.30s]  It's what's it called. It's called like my Marta. What is it? It's going too fast Mar
[13874.94s -> 13876.41s]  Matt
[13876.41s -> 13897.40s]  Mart you're okay this one. All right this one is this correct?
[13900.61s -> 13907.64s]  Yes. Yeah. All right. All right. We'll go out on this one. I'll try to get this puzzle on quick

[13976.78s -> 13986.48s]  Seven one two, three, four five six seven. So then one is part in three. So one
[13988.08s -> 14005.59s]  Bingo increase the volume. No, it's a little too loud
[14021.62s -> 14023.06s]  fourteen

[14031.65s -> 14036.06s]  one two, three four
[14036.14s -> 14083.21s]  Come on Gwen, I can do it. Come on Gwen. We're gonna need another one after this. It's getting faster
[14083.21s -> 14096.84s]  It is getting faster. Any more special requests? We got room for maybe one or two more
[14096.84s -> 14121.82s]  Maybe just a Kaizen opening. We can start doing anime openings now
[14126.10s -> 14142.81s]  All right. Here we go. What's your favorite anime opening? Let's play them all
[14143.53s -> 14175.10s]  Streams are gonna get turned off bad chest. Oh wait, this is uh, uh, hold on. I'm sorry. I paused it. This is

[14376.09s -> 14386.79s]  Yeah, I mean, I don't yeah animes are right. Like I don't hate it
[14386.79s -> 14393.75s]  I don't watch that much of it. That's why I have my I have my one anime that I watch a year
[14393.79s -> 14406.67s]  Well, I somehow I love some animes mob psycho is good
[14406.83s -> 14411.79s]  All right, if you were to pick between mob psycho and chainsaw, man
[14412.11s -> 14424.16s]  We get a poll in the chat, please Bob psycho or chainsaw, man, what would you watch Bob psycho 100% really? Okay
[14424.28s -> 14441.48s]  You would probably like mob psycho better. All right, this is getting weird here. So I'm one two three three
[14442.98s -> 14453.21s]  Are you no, I'm not high chainsaw man is I missed what you said mob psycho is a masterpiece
[14453.21s -> 14458.55s]  I don't okay. You need to close the poll. We don't need to have it open anymore
[14459.15s -> 14467.70s]  Almost that's a very very strong decision. All right, I'm almost done with this. So where are we?
[14467.86s -> 14472.55s]  How do I not have all ten of these one two five six seven eight nine
[14472.55s -> 14484.68s]  I don't want to guess but I know that's there but I mean that there's 80%

[14515.39s -> 14521.22s]  okay, I don't want to watch the mob psycho intro right now because I want to watch it when I'm sitting on the couch and
[14522.41s -> 14523.73s]  You know it gets to that part
[14523.73s -> 14528.85s]  Your favorite part where like something cool is happening a really beautifully animated sequence and it hits that drop of the song and you
[14528.85s -> 14532.45s]  Just like you feel like warm and you're just like here it comes. Yes. There it is
[14532.45s -> 14539.80s]  That's what I like and then you rewind the YouTube video of the intro
[14542.55s -> 14549.97s]  Okay, let me ask you a question and I want everyone to be real be real with me. Don't lie. Don't make it up
[14549.97s -> 14556.37s]  I want I want to know if you do this. Are you ready? I'm just I don't have to say anything
[14556.37s -> 14559.98s]  I'm just gonna do it and I want you to just observe
[14559.98s -> 14562.96s]  Let's take the one punch man intro for an example
[14613.27s -> 14616.34s]  Oh
[14650.60s -> 14652.84s]  Am I a weirdo am I a weirdo
[14653.56s -> 14656.25s]  Oh
[14665.18s -> 14669.84s]  All right, you get it you get the idea you get the idea you get the idea you get the idea
[14691.92s -> 14725.15s]  Alright so what's the last song for real because I'm about to finish the puzzle it's almost over Pokemon Colosseum music, okay
[14739.45s -> 14741.53s]  I don't know why I muted it. I like this
[14744.60s -> 14746.60s]  Why is it muting? Stop muting
[14746.60s -> 14802.03s]  Okay. All right. This is good shit. All right. What is this? Oh
[14805.85s -> 14809.05s]  I think you make a huge picture with all this. That's cool
[14809.77s -> 14835.66s]  That's I like that. All right, one more. All right people seem to do this one. This is called Anamanaguchi
[14837.02s -> 14867.29s]  Let's take a look at all the artwork a sea of people asking for bloody stream and kickback
[14867.29s -> 14874.35s]  And he picks the one dude who wanted the Pokemon salsa song. I thought it was interesting
[14874.39s -> 15080.89s]  I wanted to play it. That's pretty cool. You guys have fun. That was chill. I very much enjoyed this dream
[15080.89s -> 15085.57s]  I hope you did too and again, happy Thanksgiving. Those either celebrate it. Hope you had a good one. I
[15088.46s -> 15092.14s]  Will see you guys the next stream. I I got some sponsored stuff to do on
[15093.50s -> 15097.28s]  Saturday we're going to be playing
[15098.04s -> 15102.68s]  Darktide I've seen a lot about it. It looks really fun
[15104.27s -> 15111.62s]  Vermintide was really cool. So actually excited really excited to play it. I'm gonna play Darktide. I'm gonna try to get some
[15113.05s -> 15118.86s]  Friends some friendos to play it. So I think it's a four-player co-op. I heard it at Darktide rocks
[15118.86s -> 15123.26s]  I heard it's really good. Yeah, I'm very interested in playing it and it's gonna be sponsors. That's cool
[15124.27s -> 15128.46s]  But I'm gonna try to find a group. I'm already talking to some people should be fun
[15128.54s -> 15134.82s]  That's on Saturday the 26th and then I don't know Sunday Monday
[15134.82s -> 15145.19s]  We'll figure the rest out but I will see you guys on Saturday. Take care of yourselves again. Happy Thanksgiving
[15145.43s -> 15157.94s]  That was Miku Picross actually really good Picross. It's a little bit more beginner-friendly
[15157.94s -> 15162.72s]  I think which is a good thing if you never played it before and if you like Miku then I mean obviously it's there
[15162.98s -> 15176.20s]  Appreciate it for hanging out. I'll see you guys soon. So Saturday stream will start probably around
[15176.80s -> 15181.58s]  230 Pacific I want to say around between 2 and 230
[15181.58s -> 15186.58s]  I'd say 230 Pacific is probably a safe place to put it. Is the VOD ever gonna get uploaded?
[15186.58s -> 15199.70s]  Ah, that's a great question. I would just check in like 10 minutes. See if it's even there expect more of these though
[15199.78s -> 15207.49s]  Where we just kind of hang out I open up something a little more chill and we just play it and just do whatever
[15207.57s -> 15220.21s]  See you guys Saturday. Yeah, Breath of the Wild is like that too
[15220.21s -> 15226.31s]  It is although I I can get a little high energy on those streams just because not very good
[15226.47s -> 15244.61s]  It's still fun and I'm gonna go when I'm gonna go probably take a bath tonight. Maybe we think take a bath
[15244.61s -> 15256.61s]  I think I'm out. Happy Thanksgiving. See you later. Good night everybody call your mother
