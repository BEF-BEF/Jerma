[0.31s -> 18.00s]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Gunther. Welcome to Facecam Fortress 2. I will be your host tonight, not Jerma.
[18.00s -> 23.43s]  I'm going to be playing as the Huntsman Sniper.
[23.43s -> 31.85s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. Gunther, it's not your time to shine. You'll do that some other time.
[31.85s -> 43.38s]  Three sentries on top of the roof. Excellent. Play it as the Sniper like Gunther told you. On bad water. Didn't get the headshot, but that's okay.
[43.38s -> 52.48s]  Got it. Why am I lagging right now? I'm like lagging. Can you guys see that? Maybe I'm just going crazy.
[52.48s -> 64.84s]  So I'm wearing this goofy hat today. I know I'm not completely crazy. This is just something I found in my closet. It's actually my father's hat.
[64.84s -> 75.14s]  And I figured, you know what? Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition. I'm going to put on a dumb hat and I'm going to leave it on for the whole entire time.
[75.14s -> 86.07s]  Probably not though, because it's starting to hurt my skull. But my eyes pinched them out. I should have died.
[86.07s -> 93.51s]  We only have a minute and 50 seconds left anyways. Auto balanced. What the heck?
[93.51s -> 101.04s]  Trying to get those mad kills as a... Oh, one of these days that's going to work.
[101.04s -> 107.73s]  I saw a YouTube video one time where that actually worked very, very well. And if I don't like throw up my mouth, I'll kill this heavy.
[107.73s -> 118.78s]  Drinking too much coffee. Oh, make it three for three. Three for three. Got to get rid of that sentry.
[118.78s -> 126.78s]  And sentry down. Oh my God, I forgot. I totally forgot there was this many sentries. That's four for four.
[126.78s -> 134.37s]  Oh, you spy, you spy F word. Oh, this thing really hurts.
[134.37s -> 139.80s]  I'm going to take this off halfway through this and there's going to be a red ring around my whole skull.
[139.80s -> 152.64s]  I'm going to look like Friar Tuck. Here we go. It's going to work. I'm hoping if I get that, you're going to see a pretty ridiculous reaction.
[152.64s -> 165.97s]  You can't run from me, man. How did they not hit him in the face? Don't ask me. Here he is. No, where'd he go?
[165.97s -> 175.43s]  Oh, there's absolutely no way we're going to do this unless like an Uber demo man comes over here.
[175.43s -> 186.98s]  Show yourself. How are we supposed to do this? Look at this chaos.
[186.98s -> 194.92s]  All right. So I have actually, while we just get smoked right here by these five sentries up here, I actually have something to talk about.
[194.92s -> 205.42s]  Oh my God. Hold on. Oh, something in my eye. Oh, this is what happens when you play live. You can't control things like this.
[205.42s -> 216.37s]  Are we good? We're good. So what I want to talk about before my eye gets eaten by a leech or whatever the hell flew into my eye or whatever in my eye.
[216.37s -> 225.30s]  I want to talk about my live stream this weekend because it's actually it's something interesting I want to try and do and it has to do with choose your own adventure.
[225.30s -> 235.65s]  Now bear with me for a second. I want to make a poll every 20 minutes during my live stream tomorrow and I'm going to have like five different options.
[236.65s -> 243.38s]  So it's going to say eat an egg, do a cartwheel on camera, like play a different game.
[243.38s -> 250.38s]  Like there's going to be five different options you can choose from and whatever one gets the most amount of votes is what I'm going to do.
[250.38s -> 254.56s]  I'm going to call it the choose your own adventure live stream with Jerma.
[254.56s -> 257.86s]  Hopefully that wasn't too loud, but that's what I plan on doing tomorrow.
[257.86s -> 264.49s]  I'm going to iron out some of the details, but it could actually be pretty funny and pretty fun at the same time.
[264.49s -> 270.48s]  So we'll see how that goes. Pee on that medic.
[270.48s -> 274.48s]  And by tomorrow I should be able to stream 3D games.
[274.48s -> 278.78s]  And that's not because I got some magic patch that allowed me to stream 3D games.
[278.78s -> 284.52s]  I'm getting another computer. As ludicrous as that sounds, it's actually true.
[284.52s -> 290.82s]  I'm going to get like a cheap laptop that can stream 3D games. Where is anybody?
[290.82s -> 297.82s]  Cheap laptop, not going to get anything too fancy, but just something enough where I can be confident that I can at least stream games.
[297.82s -> 301.70s]  And that's something I am... No!
[301.70s -> 309.38s]  Aw, something I'm going to do. So I should be able to do it by tomorrow afternoon.
[309.38s -> 312.38s]  Heavy, you are spraying everywhere. You look like a real psycho.
[312.38s -> 319.28s]  So let's just roll, huh? Are we just going to roll this card? I'm going forward.
[319.28s -> 326.70s]  I'm moving forward, baby. I stand still for no man.
[326.70s -> 331.52s]  Where's the team? Did we just really push that far forward?
[331.52s -> 334.53s]  What just happened with that?
[335.53s -> 338.53s]  How did I not... Did I put anybody out with that?
[338.53s -> 343.28s]  I swear that didn't put anybody out. I threw it right in the middle of all of us.
[343.28s -> 347.94s]  Spy? No.
[347.94s -> 351.94s]  You know, I'd like to kill somebody. That would be fantastic right now.
[351.94s -> 356.52s]  I can't kill anybody. I'm just like...
[356.52s -> 359.27s]  Did I not kill that guy?
[359.27s -> 363.92s]  Alright, I'm going to switch. What is happening right now?
[363.92s -> 368.10s]  I keep hearing like the ding, but I don't kill anyone. Let's just go...
[368.10s -> 372.11s]  Let's go Demoman.
[372.11s -> 374.11s]  Uber. Uber. We got a Uber.
[380.22s -> 386.40s]  Scout, what do you think you're doing, boy?
[389.33s -> 393.30s]  New rank. New rank.
[395.79s -> 401.85s]  That guy flew a thousand feet in the air.
[401.85s -> 404.85s]  Dr. Sandvich, the hack master.
[404.85s -> 412.84s]  Alright, this thing is really starting to concave my skull. I have to get this thing off.
[413.84s -> 417.59s]  Oh, by the way, if you're wondering, they're right here.
[417.59s -> 421.28s]  It's not like they're in some case somewhere.
[421.28s -> 424.28s]  My gunner optics are sitting right here.
[424.28s -> 429.28s]  And a lot of people ask, Jerma, why do you not wear those during your face cam sessions?
[429.28s -> 433.28s]  I feel like they kind of make my face look a little different.
[433.28s -> 437.28s]  I'd rather have you guys see the real me rather than the glasses me.
[437.28s -> 442.10s]  Because I don't think I look very good in glasses. I think I look pretty bad.
[442.10s -> 447.17s]  Oh, this spy. Let's watch it. Oh, nice backstab there, dude.
[447.17s -> 453.72s]  Nice. Lock and load.
[453.72s -> 457.28s]  Miss twice. Miss again. Run.
[462.28s -> 466.28s]  Brain freeze. Brain freeze. I'm not even drinking that cold of a drink and I just got brain freeze.
[468.22s -> 473.17s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Only two and a half minutes left and we win.
[473.17s -> 479.54s]  Look at this engineer insanity. Two dispensers, three engineers, two...
[479.54s -> 481.85s]  Wow. You have to be a spy.
[481.85s -> 485.60s]  I always do that. I always think that somebody's a spy when they're just not.
[485.60s -> 488.60s]  But this guy has to be. Yes, of course he is.
[488.60s -> 496.18s]  Of course he does the thing where I... Wait. Wait. I think he went down here.
[496.18s -> 502.22s]  You know what? I'm not going on a wild goose chase right now. I got stuff to do.
[502.22s -> 506.91s]  Oh, and there he is. That's one way to do it.
[506.91s -> 520.72s]  Oh, don't you dare. Oh. Oh, yeah.
[520.72s -> 525.15s]  Oh, that was so satisfying. I love doing that. It's so much fun.
[525.15s -> 532.49s]  The lock and load is just too fun. Did I just kill two people with that?
[532.49s -> 540.15s]  Yikes. Come on. Show your bloody face.
[540.15s -> 549.13s]  Whoa. Fire. Fire. Fire. Fire. Miss. Wow.
[549.13s -> 559.30s]  Oh, but I love that same spy again. Oh, that's just depressing.
[559.30s -> 565.26s]  Have I been killed by three spy revolvers in a row? I really think I might have.
[565.26s -> 573.72s]  Just dink, dink, dink. Oh, don't let them get this.
[573.72s -> 577.92s]  Do not let... I'm going to be very upset if they get this.
[577.92s -> 584.56s]  I might, in fact, puke blood. That would be horrible.
[584.56s -> 591.09s]  Let's go straight down the line. Straight down the line with the lock and load.
[591.09s -> 604.19s]  Oh, will he do a backflip for me? Where are you going? Where are you going?
[604.19s -> 615.07s]  Where are you going? 16 seconds left. Come here. Come over here.
[615.07s -> 619.89s]  Oh. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. I think we won.
[619.89s -> 626.86s]  Over time, you're going to make me spit my coffee on the screen.
[626.86s -> 637.21s]  I will see you guys all next time. Thanks for watching so much.
[637.21s -> 641.21s]  And stay tuned for the livestream tomorrow. I might have explained that very, very strangely,
[641.21s -> 644.21s]  but it's going to be a choose-your-own-adventure livestream.
[644.21s -> 649.62s]  I will explain in better detail tomorrow when it happens, but it should be pretty fun.
[649.62s -> 652.62s]  So thanks so much, guys, for watching. I'll see you guys all soon.
[652.62s -> 654.62s]  And, of course, take care, everybody.
