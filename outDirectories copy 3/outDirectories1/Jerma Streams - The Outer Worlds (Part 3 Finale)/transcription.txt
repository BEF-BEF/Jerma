[0.50s -> 10.58s]  Ah yes, the the return of the dentist. I almost just said happy Halloween. Hey, happy Halloween
[10.58s -> 24.78s]  everybody. That whole month has just been deleted in my brain. Quick, slime them. See what you guys
[24.78s -> 31.93s]  don't know is I have all those actions still. I might just turn a stream on one day and if I
[31.93s -> 42.22s]  do though something happens. I have those forever. I get to keep those. But uh yeah, we're starting
[42.22s -> 46.30s]  a little bit or I almost said early too. First happy Halloween then hey we're starting early.
[46.94s -> 54.22s]  Now we're starting late because it's Thanksgiving and I wanted to give some time to not just
[54.22s -> 61.45s]  start streaming at one two o'clock pacific. I figured it's probably better this way. So
[63.38s -> 68.02s]  we're gonna continue the Outer Worlds. This is gonna be the last stream you see from me for
[68.34s -> 74.82s]  a little bit. I'll be gone for about three or four days because I have a procedure I have to do
[75.86s -> 83.38s]  and it requires some annoying fasting as of tomorrow and then I have to do it
[84.10s -> 93.70s]  and then I have to be on drugs. So you won't see me for a three or four days. So after today
[93.70s -> 98.58s]  this is just gonna be we're gonna end the Outer Worlds tonight. Even if I don't get to the end,
[100.17s -> 105.05s]  I'll probably just finish it off stream. It depends on how close we get because I really
[105.05s -> 112.01s]  don't know if this stream is gonna be more than five or six hours. I don't know. It might be five,
[112.01s -> 122.26s]  it might be four, it might be six, this might be eight. But happy Thanksgiving if you're celebrating
[122.26s -> 127.54s]  it or if you've not celebrated it yet. If you just got this notification and you're at the dinner
[127.54s -> 134.18s]  table, then put me on as loud as it goes, put me on speaker and sit me on the table.
[139.83s -> 150.71s]  Yeah, can I get the um, can you get, can I, can I get the peas? Thank you. The turkey is absolutely
[150.71s -> 155.51s]  delicious by the way. It's one of the best turkeys I've ever had and I really am not, I know I say
[155.51s -> 161.99s]  that every single year. I know I say that, listen mom, I know I say that every year, every time you've
[161.99s -> 169.16s]  ever made a turkey, I say it's the best turkey I've ever had. But this one is for real. Damn,
[169.16s -> 177.58s]  that's good. Oh, sorry, I mean darn, sorry about that. All right, now turn me off because I'm gonna
[177.58s -> 182.57s]  start swearing and I know like your grandfather's not gonna like it. Am I off? All right, good.
[185.59s -> 192.84s]  Anyways, let's play the Outer Worlds. All of a sudden, grandpa's like, Outer Worlds?
[194.44s -> 200.49s]  No, no, keep that on, keep that on. Hey, anything to take me away from your family like arguing
[200.49s -> 207.86s]  about politics? We can argue about like the fake politics that are in the Outer Worlds,
[209.27s -> 217.42s]  right? You don't need, you don't need, listen grandpa, we don't need to argue anymore.
[217.42s -> 234.25s]  Just listen to me. All right, let's get going. I like this song. I wish it was not just the
[234.25s -> 244.38s]  level up screen. What about those emails? Well, I've read tons of emails on computers already.
[244.38s -> 252.90s]  I've read a lot of emails. Yeah, we'll see how this goes. Just gonna keep playing it. If you
[252.90s -> 255.54s]  don't know, you probably, if this is the first stream you've been to and you're like, why is
[255.54s -> 263.02s]  you, what does this have to do with dentists? That is a 15 plus hour long build up for the joke
[263.90s -> 269.30s]  and there's not much I could say. It would take me 15 hours to explain it to you.
[269.30s -> 285.80s]  So let's go. I just love dental health, yeah. All right, let the game load. Hold on. All right,
[286.86s -> 290.22s]  so the last thing we did was, I remember I was like really tired last night. I didn't listen
[290.22s -> 295.59s]  to a single thing this person said. I think I specifically said this guy's born the fuck
[295.59s -> 299.83s]  out of me and then like I turned off the stream. So I did what, I don't remember what this was.
[305.56s -> 310.60s]  Then I killed him. No, he's still alive. All right, here we go. This is, we have to go back to
[311.82s -> 315.26s]  the information broker promised to find the location of the chemicals needed
[315.82s -> 321.18s]  by Phineas. Problem is he hasn't delivered the intel on time and hasn't provided an explanation.
[321.18s -> 325.74s]  Travel to Monarch, find him and obtain the data. Okay, this is where I am now.
[327.50s -> 332.46s]  The broker can't deliver the location of the chemicals until you stop the Iconoclasts and MSI
[332.46s -> 339.50s]  transmissions that are interfering with the tower. Okay, so Sanjar leads MSI out of Stellar Bay
[340.06s -> 346.14s]  and Graham Bryant leads the Iconoclasts out of Amber Heights. Earning their favor might
[346.14s -> 352.60s]  convince them to stop transmitting. Complete the quest, bolt with his name for Sanjar to start
[352.60s -> 357.37s]  earning MSI's trust. All right, so what do I want to do here?
[359.43s -> 371.42s]  Should I just go just take a chainsaw and just cut the tower down? Well, let's go to,
[372.46s -> 381.35s]  Sanjar needs a bolt 52 cartridge. I remember this part. All right, let's get into the good graces
[381.35s -> 389.38s]  of Sanjar. So we need to get into the arms building. Now, where the hell is that? Oh,
[389.38s -> 393.54s]  fuck. Sorry, I forgot. Yeah, I forgot. I forgot I was going to shoot that guy in the head right
[393.62s -> 400.94s]  when the stream started. Oops, I forgot. Yeah, I was like actually planning on doing that too.
[400.94s -> 411.90s]  That's all right. Damn it. Oh, I was too busy like thinking about Thanksgiving. Oh,
[411.90s -> 418.14s]  that was going to be fun too. Damn it. I really like was going to do that. I was going to actually
[418.14s -> 427.94s]  do that. Begin Broadway. I can start. I can turn the stream button on. Authorized broadcaster,
[427.94s -> 431.54s]  don't even try to pretend you're unaware that all broadcasting is currently locked down.
[432.34s -> 437.14s]  Please return to milling about the break room and lamenting that internship and corporate
[437.78s -> 442.90s]  arbitration that you never finished. Or to override the lock on recording, simply enter your admin
[442.90s -> 447.94s]  username and password in the command line. Oh, you can't maybe you should have been nicer to Val.
[449.06s -> 457.77s]  That's not good. All right, let's go. Wow, where is this? Is this on the other planet?
[458.73s -> 476.09s]  Time to turn on the webcam. Not time to turn on the webcam. All right, now where is this thing?
[478.41s -> 492.74s]  That's very far away, but it's not far away from here. Show us those teeth. Hurry up and do
[492.74s -> 508.76s]  something funny. Hurry. Hurry, quick. You'll get used to it. Hurry, quick, quick. Rush a joke so
[508.76s -> 512.52s]  I can do minus two because it wasn't funny because you didn't take the time to prepare
[512.52s -> 537.90s]  something interesting. Quick, hurry. Are you all right? My investment.
[538.70s -> 551.37s]  Shoot that rat with some knockback. You pull out of the archive here and start saying like
[551.37s -> 563.45s]  words that you like. When in doubt, say a word that everybody likes. Automatic comedy increase.
[573.70s -> 590.78s]  You're good. Game's too loud. I got you. Solved. I don't want to find all these stupid monsters,
[591.42s -> 606.73s]  but I guess I kind of have to. God damn it. All right, user special. Don't call them stupid.
[607.61s -> 612.44s]  Well, they are stupid. I mean, their intelligence level is not very high.
[613.24s -> 623.91s]  That doesn't mean I don't. Neither is my character. Yeah, that's okay. Call me stupid.
[625.03s -> 629.83s]  This character is stupid, but so is that animal that's right there. This animal is also stupid.
[633.98s -> 643.91s]  Why did I shoot the Colossus? I probably should not have shot the Colossus. That was stupid.
[644.55s -> 652.73s]  You are absolutely inclined to call me fucking stupid for that. Time to run. Wait, it's in here.
[656.39s -> 665.72s]  Holy shit. He just almost insta-killed me. Oh, I can't even open this door. Oh, he still sees me.
[665.72s -> 675.29s]  I'm dead. Heal. How do I heal? I don't have any heals left. Oh, okay. Well, that's a disaster.
[675.85s -> 691.05s]  How do I not have any heals left? God damn it. I'm just gonna go the other way.
[694.54s -> 703.62s]  I only have one heal. Who took them all? Wait, hold on a minute. I gotta go to Stellar Bay.
[703.62s -> 716.44s]  I gotta buy some heals. What happened to Sam and Max? They're still on the ship.
[716.44s -> 731.74s]  I was just trying two other dentists. Oh, yeah. Okay, well, that's still there. You guys,
[731.74s -> 742.12s]  that's true. All right. I need just a vending machine or something. All right, do you sell stuff?
[742.76s -> 761.22s]  Not the stuff I want. There we go. Buy them. Okay. What is this? Baked beans? No. Oh, fuck me.
[761.22s -> 773.30s]  Really? That's the same goddamn syringe. I bought the wrong thing. All right, where's the medic?
[773.30s -> 787.62s]  Where's the person that sells medicine? There you are. I would like to buy something.
[788.34s -> 796.18s]  Oh, god damn it. Why can I not buy anything from you? Aren't you the town medic? What?
[801.48s -> 807.21s]  Steal? I can't even steal. I already took everything from our house. Is there a vending
[807.21s -> 814.65s]  machine in there or do I have to go find the vending machine? You don't sell, do you?
[815.37s -> 820.17s]  If it isn't the famous hacker enjoying Stellar Bay, what can I do for you?
[822.68s -> 841.80s]  Nothing. Vending machine. Vendor. Okay. The yacht club vendor. Can I not see what these are? Vending
[841.80s -> 845.16s]  machine. Like, I can't. It's just there? All right. Well, it's just there apparently.
[848.38s -> 857.58s]  Go buy a yacht. Wasn't this the one I was just using? Maybe not. Okay. What's in here?
[861.29s -> 867.35s]  There's no heels here. Don't tell me I have to travel to like another galaxy to buy heels.
[867.35s -> 883.48s]  That's not going to happen, right? Where's this other one? In here? What was I just? Okay. So
[883.48s -> 891.80s]  where's this one? All right. Time to get in a spaceship and travel across the galaxy to buy
[891.80s -> 898.73s]  stim packs. Well, well. What? Isn't often we see new folk in Stellar Bay? First drink some.
[900.33s -> 905.88s]  I'm sure I'll take a drink. Enjoy. If you're keeping Neoka company, you'll need a few to
[905.88s -> 910.12s]  keep up with her. Sure. Do you have any heels? I need a person on this planet who can keep up with me.
[911.32s -> 916.12s]  Wait, we are talking about a drinking contest, right? Now what can I do for you?
[917.08s -> 926.70s]  No, you just have booze. All right. Well, what is the, what's my, what's my actual ship?
[927.50s -> 937.85s]  This is a heel, right? Injectable healing enhancer. Heals 20. Okay. My goodness.
[943.18s -> 959.29s]  There we go. Good. All right. I got enough. Oh, where is it? There it is. All right. I got 39
[959.29s -> 967.61s]  and I got this, uh, what do I want to use? Critical damage plus 15%. Yeah. Let's like use this shit.
[968.17s -> 973.67s]  How about the wrong thing? No, it's not. Heals 25% health over two seconds.
[974.31s -> 992.68s]  Isn't that just like a quick heal? You're going to get addicted to drugs. That's all right. He's
[992.68s -> 1000.44s]  already addicted. No, I've been breathing in all kinds of gases and my character's fine. No,
[1000.44s -> 1015.35s]  the only thing that's happened to me this whole game is I'm afraid of monsters. That's it. It's
[1015.35s -> 1025.86s]  given me a, it gives you a choice if you want to be afraid of monsters or not. Okay. Let's go.
[1025.86s -> 1032.60s]  It's like, you know, you've seen quite a few monsters. Are you scared of them? Yes. No. Okay.
[1032.60s -> 1038.44s]  But if you were scared of them, we would give you a point to put in. Ooh, I'm scared of monsters.
[1039.16s -> 1048.14s]  They terrify me. I'm just like lying on a fucking job interview. It's like, all right, let's just
[1048.14s -> 1067.48s]  move. Don't attack the Colossus. Oh, for the love of God, I'm just running. I don't even have it
[1067.48s -> 1080.82s]  selected. Yes, I do. I get into the arms building. I can't even, I have to like find a key card or
[1080.82s -> 1093.38s]  something. I can't even lock, pick this fucking door. It's so dead. There's a whole entire town
[1093.38s -> 1106.46s]  of monsters is chasing at us. Why are you using that? Good. The big one can't even get in. Just
[1106.46s -> 1125.61s]  feed them in here. Okay. Uh, how am I supposed to get in that building? The bolt 52 is an abandoned
[1125.61s -> 1129.85s]  building north of stellar Bay. So I need a key card to get into there, but I don't have one. Or
[1129.85s -> 1134.90s]  I have to get up. I need one of those lock pickers. You guys just, you're doing fine out there.
[1145.78s -> 1167.35s]  Oh my God. I need one mag lock. Is that seriously the only way I can get in this building?
[1168.23s -> 1180.39s]  I almost just shot you. It has to be another way. Where's the big guy? All the way down there. Good.
[1180.39s -> 1191.64s]  All right. So front door. I needed one of those, uh, lockpick things. This doesn't work or a key
[1191.64s -> 1209.37s]  card, but where the hell would the key card be? I can't jump up or anything. No, I have to go in
[1209.37s -> 1219.11s]  the door. There's no way for me to climb, right? All right. Well, let's try to find the, one of
[1219.11s -> 1235.27s]  those door openers. I can't seriously be the only way you can get in that building. Let's try to
[1235.27s -> 1247.77s]  find one. That's a good question. What about here? Can I open up like a panel in the back?
[1256.52s -> 1261.32s]  Let's find a door opener. I just need to find one of those, uh, not the stunts, like the, the mag
[1261.32s -> 1281.91s]  picks. Evicted. Can't go in. Uh, nothing was in here. What about in here? Over here? Well, all
[1281.91s -> 1306.39s]  right. We're going to keep looking. Blue bodies. Monsters will have a door open, a pick on them.
[1307.43s -> 1317.42s]  I don't think so. Only monsters live in this whole galaxy here. This whole planet is just these
[1318.38s -> 1322.70s]  aliens. I don't think they're picking locks. I think they're eating people and knocking doors
[1322.70s -> 1351.46s]  down with their tails. Give me in here. Come on. No, shit. I think I've seen more weapon mods than
[1351.46s -> 1383.78s]  I have mag picks. Just meat. Everybody's evicted. I'm just like going back to the town now. What
[1383.78s -> 1391.30s]  did I do for Thanksgiving? I did not do very much because, uh, at this household we did the
[1391.38s -> 1400.17s]  Thanksgiving a little early because I, as of yesterday, could not eat a lot of the stuff
[1400.17s -> 1410.39s]  that is served at Thanksgiving. So no peas, no corn, no nuts. No. So I was kind of like,
[1410.39s -> 1427.46s]  let's just do it early. So we did it a little early. Okay. Am I about to literally just bust
[1427.46s -> 1439.14s]  a door down with my fucking face? How do I get up there? There's a ladder there, but can I jump
[1439.14s -> 1461.21s]  from here? I can't jump from here to there. You can. I mean, maybe I can. Oh my God.
[1465.77s -> 1485.56s]  I wonder, can I get off of this planet? This planet sucks. I have to like de-aggro the gigantic
[1485.56s -> 1498.36s]  guy. What's the aggro range? All right. Well I de-aggro him, but I have to cross the fucking
[1498.36s -> 1518.84s]  mode again. I can't kill it. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Don't turn
[1518.84s -> 1534.62s]  around. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Good. Keep eating. Keep eating Ellie. All right.
[1534.62s -> 1554.02s]  Now turn around. He's going to see me. Maybe not. Okay. So can I jump from here to there to there?
[1554.82s -> 1559.14s]  I like guys saying that there's a ladder. I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about.
[1560.28s -> 1575.27s]  I see that one, but not over here. Is it a ladder on the other building? If I have to kill one more
[1575.27s -> 1589.40s]  of these Warcraft monsters, I swear to God, anytime I like go up here and then cross from the top.
[1589.40s -> 1622.17s]  Okay. I see. I mean it's a ladder in another game. I didn't realize this was here. All right. I made
[1622.17s -> 1646.20s]  it. Let me in, child. Let me in. Sorry. Couldn't help it. Who's there? Why don't you keep that
[1646.20s -> 1659.34s]  going? That would be hilarious. This person would think that you were a conscious, thought-thinking
[1659.98s -> 1665.90s]  raptidon. I ran in here and now the door's locked. Help. You got locked in? Well, I need to get in
[1665.90s -> 1672.02s]  that room. I need to get in there, but maybe I'll let you starve first. That's terrible.
[1678.46s -> 1708.73s]  Open the door. I'll just go in. Don't worry. I'll get in there. 50. 40. That's a lot. All right. Can
[1708.73s -> 1716.47s]  I go up? Do I go up and around? Oh, there's the mag pack. That's what I was looking for.
[1726.23s -> 1734.57s]  View executive reviews. Loading last access document. Sandra has a bad habit of padding
[1734.57s -> 1739.53s]  his reports with numbers and statistics. Not very good with slogans, jingles, and or taglines.
[1740.33s -> 1744.54s]  Presentations tend to be dry and lacking in emotional appeal and funny references.
[1745.58s -> 1753.46s]  Like the first 20 minutes of this stream. And it's really pissing people up. Sandra also displays
[1753.46s -> 1759.70s]  a noted tendency to complete work rather than delegating at a trend unbecoming in upper management.
[1759.70s -> 1764.46s]  All in all, Sandra's work habits suggest a preoccupation with details and a startling
[1764.46s -> 1771.72s]  lack of vision. Needs improvement. Okay. Screenshot it. Screenshot it. Hack. Wait. What?
[1772.44s -> 1782.25s]  Accessing restricted file. Spoof login credentials. Ooh. Graham's understanding of product messaging
[1782.25s -> 1787.13s]  and branding is impressive, especially for a relatively low-level editor. Has a knock,
[1787.93s -> 1791.93s]  is a knack for memorable slogans and taglines. However, Graham has issues with brevity and
[1791.93s -> 1797.05s]  shows consistent disregard for prescribed fonts and formats. Some of his work has been flagged
[1797.05s -> 1804.10s]  for subversive under... What do I care? Just delete all their emails. Fuck it. I don't care.
[1804.98s -> 1815.11s]  Oh wait. That was... I was supposed to... I was supposed to do that. Force is...
[1815.35s -> 1828.74s]  Well, looks like we're going the black hat route because I just did the thing that the bad guy
[1828.74s -> 1835.06s]  just wanted me to do because I was too annoyed to go through the email so I just deleted them.
[1840.49s -> 1849.38s]  All right. Well, let's keep going. I'm getting in that room. I know you can hear me talking right
[1849.38s -> 1888.52s]  now. I'm coming in that room. I'll be there real soon. 75. Fuck. I gotta go find the rat that ate
[1888.52s -> 1894.14s]  him. Seeing as you're trapped, you might as well answer me a few things. We don't... Fuck it. Let's
[1894.14s -> 1902.65s]  go get it. Uh, arms key. Mm-hmm. Right. It's in the... It's in the colossus's stomach.
[1904.63s -> 1912.63s]  Well, we're safe up here. That was so easy. How did I not be... Why did I say I couldn't do that?
[1914.65s -> 1917.29s]  That was simple. That was the easiest fucking enemy in the whole game.
[1918.25s -> 1924.01s]  Why did I think that that was scary? I was actually scared of the monster and it's
[1924.65s -> 1942.79s]  built into my character's DNA. I could have just got that like 15 minutes ago. God damn it.
[1942.79s -> 1952.14s]  I was... I'm going in. Hi.
[1967.54s -> 1983.54s]  Uh, normally when you help someone, they give you something for the trouble.
[1984.18s -> 1989.98s]  With the trouble you caused me, you're dying here. Normally when you help somebody, you get something.
[1997.08s -> 2001.16s]  By being saved by me, you entered into a non-negotiable contract. You now owe me.
[2002.04s -> 2004.06s]  Give me something or I'm stuffing you back in here.
[2004.62s -> 2012.46s]  Agreed to be saved if I'd known that. All right, here.
[2013.74s -> 2020.57s]  Okay. Thank you. 600 bits. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Beat it. You sure you're okay? I don't care.
[2021.29s -> 2036.28s]  Beat it. Yes, sir. If Max were here, that would have ended a lot differently.
[2036.92s -> 2054.38s]  I learned this in prison! Max is... Oh, wait. Can we do this? Let's do this together. You go over here
[2054.38s -> 2061.90s]  and let's talk through the wall together. Whatever. Thing sucks. Let's go. All right,
[2061.90s -> 2074.58s]  I did it. All right, I have a criticism of the game. This whole game has... It's almost like I
[2074.58s -> 2078.98s]  just got out of a pool. You know, when you look at shit, when you get out of a like a chlorine
[2078.98s -> 2088.18s]  filled pool, they have the chlorine pool filter on this whole game. Uh, I have too much stuff.
[2093.42s -> 2104.46s]  Security blade. Get rid of it. Break it down. Uh, side is cool. Uh, the Furman. What is that?
[2104.46s -> 2120.97s]  I need to look at this stuff. What am I at? 148. What's this dude talking about? I'm talking
[2120.97s -> 2129.24s]  about when you when you're in the pool for way too long and you have you have a ton of like wrinkly
[2129.24s -> 2137.91s]  ass skin and when you everything has like a haze that you can't get rid of for like 45 minutes.
[2138.71s -> 2154.47s]  Have you guys never been in a pool? What? What? You guys don't know the pool eyes?
[2155.11s -> 2161.99s]  You did no way. You guys have to know. You have to know this. I'm not going to get I'm not going
[2161.99s -> 2170.50s]  to get fucking fibbed on here. Wait, I have options. Let me see. Return the bolt to Sanjar.
[2171.86s -> 2175.62s]  Uh, Sanjar leads the MSI so I got to complete the bold quest and maybe he'll like me.
[2176.34s -> 2186.31s]  What are you talking about?
[2192.78s -> 2198.46s]  You know when you just when things have are so normal to you and you talk about how these
[2198.46s -> 2203.26s]  doing these normal ass things and a shitload of people tell you that that is not normal.
[2204.28s -> 2209.56s]  If you go into a pool with chlorine in it and you like are going underwater and you're like opening
[2209.56s -> 2220.17s]  your eyes underwater you get the like haze around lights and what are you talking about? Don't do
[2220.17s -> 2227.27s]  that. That's not what? Why are you opening your eyes in a chlorine pool? No one opens their eyes
[2227.27s -> 2235.70s]  in the chlorine pool. What are you talking about? Don't open your eyes. You guys didn't used to try
[2235.70s -> 2241.54s]  to see really hard. You'd go underwater and you'd rip your eyes open and be like look around and I
[2241.54s -> 2247.83s]  want to be able to see underwater like Aquaman. You guys didn't do that? I know for a fact at
[2247.83s -> 2257.82s]  least half of you did. You touch your eyes you like eat oh please don't even give me this like
[2258.78s -> 2263.90s]  he's chlorine's getting in the in his blood. You get out of the pool and you like grab the
[2263.90s -> 2267.90s]  sandwich and you take a bite out of your ham and cheese sandwich by next to the pool with the
[2267.90s -> 2273.86s]  at the cooler with your mom. Well you didn't wash your hands did you? You got chlorine in your mouth
[2273.86s -> 2285.32s]  now. You're forever contaminated. Who eats with wet hands? I don't know 10 year olds. You guys were 10
[2285.32s -> 2297.10s]  once. You had a sobering effect. Sir please stop. Forgive me Celia. I couldn't help myself.
[2297.82s -> 2303.78s]  Anyway what can I do for you? Okay hold on this is important. Pay attention everybody.
[2306.98s -> 2311.62s]  Found your view on a terminal in the arms building. I need MSI to stop broadcasting your jamming
[2311.62s -> 2321.75s]  devil's peak station. Found the cartridge and deleted that data for you. Look at this smug look.
[2324.55s -> 2335.51s]  Hmm I found that cartridge and accidentally deleted that data for you.
[2335.51s -> 2341.50s]  Oh yes I'm going to be up all night with this. All those blanks waiting to be filled. Boxes
[2341.50s -> 2348.38s]  waiting to be ticked. Try to control yourself sir. Have you any idea how powerful this is?
[2348.38s -> 2358.55s]  Corporations have been toppled with less. Oh okay. How exactly is data cartridge going to help? You
[2358.55s -> 2362.71s]  made it sound like you were sending me after a weapon. I don't think this will fit in any
[2362.71s -> 2372.36s]  of my guns. See Celia he gets it. I told you he would. So you did sir. The world isn't changed
[2372.36s -> 2376.92s]  with guns and speeches much as Graham and his followers would like to think but rather with
[2376.92s -> 2388.92s]  meticulous documentation. Chlorine. Hey by the way all of you health nuts in the chat right now.
[2389.72s -> 2395.10s]  When was the last time you drank water? You know what they put in the water right Chlorine?
[2396.06s -> 2401.75s]  If you ever drink water out of the tap you're drinking Chlorine unless you got yourself a
[2401.75s -> 2414.34s]  Berkey unit then it clears it out. Use a filter. I do. I use a full Berkey water filtration system.
[2427.43s -> 2429.43s]  Pool water and tap water are the same.
[2434.65s -> 2438.81s]  You've ingested Chlorine in your life and you know you have.
[2439.85s -> 2445.45s]  And you're sitting there now going you're doing the cartoon like Bugs Bunny. You got your nails.
[2445.45s -> 2451.93s]  Both your hands are up in your mouth and you're like ear of corn on your nails going wait a minute
[2451.93s -> 2465.94s]  he's right. Spare me the details of what comes next. Corporate espionage. How was that Celia?
[2465.94s -> 2472.39s]  Did I sell it? Fast delivery yet sir. Do you filter your shower water? No I don't shower.
[2473.43s -> 2485.86s]  Wait well you guys you guys shower in 2020. I just wait till it rains and then I go out there
[2485.86s -> 2495.38s]  with a bar of soap. That's a true natural way to bathe. It kind of spoils the effect if you
[2495.38s -> 2498.90s]  have to ask. Promise me that once I've helped you with this MSI will stop broadcasting.
[2499.70s -> 2509.48s]  Yeah you killed it. Celia? Already noted for your review sir. Go into the pool
[2510.81s -> 2516.33s]  with a bar of soap. Imagine if you were at like a community pool and you're just sitting there
[2516.33s -> 2522.79s]  like with like soap and you're all suds'd up. I'd be like I'm out of here. I'm not going in this pool.
[2526.15s -> 2530.87s]  What's what's the plan? I have reason to believe that one of the other corporations is operating
[2530.87s -> 2538.39s]  on Monarch illegally and in secret. Those bastards leave us to our perils then come back just to
[2538.39s -> 2545.19s]  reap what they can. If we can find proof I can use that as leverage to encourage certain powers
[2545.19s -> 2553.58s]  that be to accept our Bolt 52 and reinstate us on the board. Now what does that mean for me? If
[2553.58s -> 2558.78s]  someone is operating here then Catherine's almost certainly supplying them out of Fallbrook. Perhaps
[2558.78s -> 2563.34s]  she could be convinced to tell you where they are. I remember me and Kim one time went to a community
[2563.34s -> 2572.02s]  pool and we walked in and nobody was in the pool. We were like what's going on here? Why is nobody
[2572.02s -> 2576.66s]  in the pool? There was a bunch of people there. They're all sitting around the sides and we're
[2576.66s -> 2582.18s]  like this is all right cool we got like the we could just go in and Kim went to go in and she
[2582.18s -> 2589.27s]  put you know she got it maybe to her shins and there was one of the lifeguards get out out out
[2590.15s -> 2596.98s]  oh what's what's going on oh somebody threw up in the pool so they have to shock it it takes like
[2596.98s -> 2603.82s]  an hour before anyone can go back in and is it weird for me to say not only do I not want to
[2603.82s -> 2610.68s]  go in that pool but I never want to go in that pool ever again is that like somebody threw up
[2610.68s -> 2619.13s]  in that pool and it's just mixed in there forever you just don't just dump chemicals in it and then
[2619.13s -> 2625.45s]  I got me thinking how many times has this happened because they were very nonchalant about the whole
[2625.45s -> 2630.49s]  thing it was just like not not yeah no just an hour or so yeah take about an hour whatever
[2631.05s -> 2636.46s]  that happens like five times a day how many times has somebody thrown up in the community pool
[2636.46s -> 2641.58s]  or like shitting it or whatever I don't know I don't does that make me does it make me like
[2641.58s -> 2650.71s]  a weirdo if I'm not wanting to go in a community pool it's a shitload of chemicals a ton of
[2650.71s -> 2659.61s]  chemicals to counteract a ton of puke and pee and shit this probably maybe 40 percent actual
[2659.61s -> 2671.75s]  water in that pool the rest is like made of gel with all these chemicals and human pee 99
[2671.75s -> 2680.73s]  people pee in pools that's what I'm saying and then people well what about the ocean but the ocean
[2680.73s -> 2688.25s]  is huge I feel like diluted human pee in the ocean you know you're talking about like 30
[2688.25s -> 2694.41s]  decimal points to the right for a while what actual human pee is in the ocean that pool is
[2694.41s -> 2707.51s]  a concentrated small area but as much as I love your can-do attitude and dangerous gravitas would
[2707.51s -> 2713.51s]  you rather have those chemicals or brown yellow water if you could leave her in one I don't know
[2713.51s -> 2722.89s]  what's worse how you people put it it's both they both suck what is he saying leave her in peace
[2723.61s -> 2727.51s]  what the fuck are you talking about of course I didn't mean to make assumptions
[2728.23s -> 2735.19s]  once you uh subtly work out whether centrist bring back proof of its operation maybe some nice
[2735.19s -> 2740.63s]  leather head you gotta pick you gotta pick pee somebody peeing in the pool versus chemicals in
[2740.63s -> 2755.80s]  the pool oh what a fucking centrist how about the pool is just normal I think now this would be
[2755.80s -> 2763.46s]  interesting if you had to sign a waiver before you got in the pool that said hey uh if I piss
[2763.46s -> 2772.41s]  shit or puke in this pool I have to give everybody else at the pool 20 bucks I yeah I probably sign
[2772.41s -> 2781.02s]  it because everybody has to get out of the pool and you like ruin everybody's day if you like
[2781.02s -> 2785.10s]  diarrhea in a pool you should have I mean come on like this should be a waiver you signed before you
[2785.10s -> 2788.70s]  go to a community pool yes I am not going to throw up in the pool and if I do then I'm going
[2788.70s -> 2798.41s]  to pay everybody at the pool their admission fee because then they can't go in the pool that's
[2798.41s -> 2818.33s]  what they came there for imagine getting out of the pool to pee yeah we got you motherfucker
[2819.05s -> 2822.25s]  now you're gonna yeah you're gonna bet you're gonna give us all five bucks
[2823.93s -> 2836.82s]  I bet you won't do it again I bet you'll think twice imagine the look on that person's face
[2837.54s -> 2844.79s]  that like ever went through and again it's like we have pee in the pool we have a device that
[2844.79s -> 2848.55s]  tells you if somebody peed and like the guy is just in there just sitting there like oh
[2848.55s -> 2853.43s]  shit they found me come on get out they go to the ATM they have to take out like
[2854.71s -> 2863.75s]  $1,500 in cash and have to walk around and hand it out to every single person I'm sorry about this
[2863.75s -> 2868.39s]  I'm sorry I'm pissed in the pool I have a great rest of the day happy Thanksgiving by the way
[2868.39s -> 2873.91s]  oh yeah you came here with all your kids yeah they're crying because they can't swim I'm so
[2873.91s -> 2877.75s]  sorry here's ten dollars I didn't mean I just had I just pissed in the pool I'm sorry about that
[2878.07s -> 2883.51s]  my name's Frank by the way oh the couple here on their honeymoon I'm sorry yeah good to see
[2883.51s -> 2887.99s]  I'm really really sorry about ruining your honeymoon and shitting in the pool but I had
[2887.99s -> 2901.37s]  to go and it was all free to go I have a happy Thanksgiving that would be fucked all right listen
[2901.37s -> 2920.18s]  I gotta pay attention to the video game who pees in the pool here so I can block you do you get
[2920.18s -> 2925.93s]  banned for life if you like pissing if you like throw up in a pool do you have to like sign
[2925.93s -> 2934.49s]  something how do you get do you get banned for life you don't you throw up in the pool
[2936.33s -> 2941.29s]  they wipe it all out they pull you out and then they like close you behind the gates like
[2943.51s -> 2967.19s]  you're never allowed back in the kingdom again pool puker psycho don't stop pissing in pools
[2968.78s -> 2974.06s]  I am going to oh I am god I got you all now I got you all now I don't care if we've hit it
[2974.06s -> 2979.18s]  for another 10 minutes remember when everybody was talking shit to me about peeing in the shower
[2981.08s -> 2988.26s]  every there's a lot of people in here that seem to think that peeing in their bathtub is is okay
[2988.26s -> 2995.34s]  but increase your bathtub size by a thousand percent and then let a bunch of other people
[2995.34s -> 3009.99s]  in your bathtub while you piss in it but that's okay so you so then you piss in the bathtub
[3009.99s -> 3014.84s]  and then invite all your friends over and say let's get in let's get in the pool
[3014.84s -> 3027.02s]  I got I got fucking people went and people went on me hard for the like pee in the shower bit
[3027.02s -> 3041.13s]  and a bunch of you could talk about how you pee in pools I cannot believe it peeing in the shower
[3041.13s -> 3050.79s]  is fine peeing in the bathtub is not correct why would you pee in the bathtub you're lying there
[3050.79s -> 3061.16s]  just that would be disgusting wouldn't it because you're surrounded by it give me a break I piss in
[3061.16s -> 3083.94s]  the pool from the outside well I hope you got arrested because that's crazy listen listen to me
[3083.94s -> 3091.91s]  that's crazy right if you were to just piss into a pool from the outside like a giant urinal that
[3091.91s -> 3096.63s]  would be the most fucked up thing you could ever do in public in a scenario where you're at the
[3096.63s -> 3102.39s]  pool but why is it when you go under the water that it's now okay for you to do the same thing
[3107.77s -> 3127.67s]  you're just getting caught in one of those scenarios because no one else sees it yeah that's
[3127.67s -> 3142.10s]  that's crazy all right time to reset reset we have he's just been listening to this the whole time
[3144.79s -> 3149.75s]  right this is these are the eyes that he's giving me right now these are the I agree with everything
[3149.75s -> 3155.35s]  you're saying but I'm not gonna like speak up about what you're saying but keep going keep going
[3156.52s -> 3167.96s]  keep doing it see those are the eyes that say keep going go into the lair should I
[3168.68s -> 3175.80s]  Sanjay should I go another lair that's like to go on come on you're doing a good thing here
[3175.80s -> 3181.48s]  all right rewind reset a foolproof plan if I ever heard one I'll leave the execution to you
[3182.68s -> 3193.37s]  really I need MSI to stop broadcasting you're jamming the I found your review on a terminal
[3193.37s -> 3200.78s]  in the arms building I asked you to delete it sorry it was open you could have told me what
[3200.78s -> 3204.94s]  was on it yeah you sent me into a raptidon infested mess to clean up after you I didn't
[3204.94s -> 3212.04s]  mean for any harm to come to you yeah I read the emails my albatross a great shame of my career
[3212.84s -> 3225.74s]  I give MSI everything my work my youth my left kidney and for years I was a joke to them your
[3225.74s -> 3231.74s]  left kidney oh one of the executives required a transplant he's lucky they didn't want a liver
[3231.74s -> 3236.22s]  or a heart I thought volunteering to donate might improve my prospects
[3237.99s -> 3245.54s]  God did it apparently not who cares what they think you're in charge now that's what you get
[3245.54s -> 3255.21s]  for giving so much of yourself over to a corporation perhaps they were right after all what have I
[3255.21s -> 3262.97s]  built stellar bay is barely keeping afloat you're in charge yeah take it easy you've kept the city
[3262.97s -> 3266.57s]  running against all odds do you want a medal you're right this place is a garbage heap
[3267.53s -> 3277.69s]  take it easy you thought of it that way perhaps there's something to that thank you for that
[3277.69s -> 3288.38s]  don't see was there something else did I even say happy thanksgiving I did right I did yeah I lost
[3288.38s -> 3292.14s]  all memories when I was talking about people pissing into a pool from the outside that's
[3292.14s -> 3300.42s]  where like I lost I got amnesia for like the last 12 hours uh all right uh should I make them stop
[3300.50s -> 3304.02s]  broadcasting or should I just say who cares that guy bored me I don't like who cares
[3305.30s -> 3311.13s]  okay radio free help the broker deal no I have to do this
[3311.69s -> 3323.72s]  complete the quest unseen errors unseen to earn and the size trust the broker can't deliver the
[3323.72s -> 3330.52s]  location of the chemicals until you stop msi's transmissions so I have to do it thank you again
[3330.52s -> 3338.04s]  for retrieving the bolt it's every bit as complex as I'd heard but I'm up to the challenge anyway
[3338.60s -> 3345.05s]  what can I do for you stop broadcasting you think we're the problem have you even heard the
[3345.05s -> 3351.45s]  nonsense graham is spewing it isn't easy keeping a town like stellar bay afloat especially without
[3351.45s -> 3356.49s]  the board's backing not doing a genocide run has really hurt your reputation as a wacky streamer
[3357.53s -> 3362.26s]  you need to reach your trading partners I'll deal with graham right now I'm talking to you
[3363.22s -> 3372.89s]  of a situation don't you it's warm in here is anyone else warm what he means to say
[3373.85s -> 3379.13s]  the stream just derailed for almost 15 to 20 straight minutes talking about pissing and
[3379.13s -> 3384.89s]  shitting into pools on the board is also active on monarch that'll give me all the what's a wacky
[3384.89s -> 3393.27s]  strange conversation to you guys is that nor was that that was a normal guy that was a normal
[3393.27s -> 3405.82s]  conversation apparently no you have to kill npcs you have to shoot npc then it's wacky
[3407.85s -> 3416.62s]  don't worry I'll I'll kill an npc and it'll be super wacky I promise all right if we can
[3416.62s -> 3420.06s]  find proof that one of the companies on board is also active on monarch that'll give me all
[3420.06s -> 3433.48s]  the leverage I need fair enough I would understand wacky hey anybody here want to get wackified

[4634.89s -> 4639.32s]  to break down anything to just be able to fast travel and sell everything why would you ever
[4639.32s -> 4655.74s]  use this this is 100 useless turn off the face cam not staying on uh science weapon this is not
[4657.30s -> 4662.63s]  this is not bad six bit movement penalty to accuracy that's not that's pretty good too

[5138.70s -> 5144.31s]  propaganda against their people your broadcasts aren't working nobody's listening
[5145.11s -> 5148.55s]  you know the board is going to let its citizens listen to your propaganda
[5149.75s -> 5153.75s]  and nobody's listening to your broadcasts I realize the board has blockaded our efforts but
[5154.71s -> 5158.79s]  devil's peak is an interplanetary radio tower surely somebody is listening
[5159.83s -> 5168.10s]  no surely sorry uh you're only transmitting on a single radio frequency and very few people
[5168.10s -> 5174.34s]  can actually receive it this is not even a lie this is a science I'm just telling this guy the
[5174.42s -> 5182.26s]  truth gram we should be focusing on survival anyway food ammo and medicine maybe now is the
[5182.26s -> 5191.29s]  time to pivot pivot if radio isn't working we might try another way it seems the captain's

[5197.13s -> 5202.41s]  press for some time the board uses magazines and advertisements to subtly focus the colony's
[5202.89s -> 5210.97s]  is to use app no those are all things you should not ever be doing that's all terrible advice

[5261.59s -> 5267.99s]  periodicals even I find myself occasionally distracted by their fish propaganda quality
[5267.99s -> 5273.43s]  of editing and unacceptable disregard for grammatical structure my literary prowess
[5273.43s -> 5280.47s]  will hook them and the eternal truth will reel them in what's into me I'm starting to sound like

[7769.66s -> 7788.17s]  to shoot you how do I go up this guy is in such a dumb place why can't you just meet me at the
[7788.17s -> 7801.03s]  front door don't be a fool it's the blessed sound of radio silence which leads me to believe you
[7801.03s -> 7809.27s]  have sweet sweet news for me I do MSI and the iconoclast are no longer transmitting is the data
[7809.27s -> 7818.15s]  ready yes indeed I am back in business but before we get down to it might I ask how you handled
[7818.15s -> 7824.47s]  the problem none of your business does it matter job's done thank you I couldn't have said it better
[7824.47s -> 7831.93s]  myself I hope to both MSI and the iconoclast get what they wanted you're an information broker if
[7831.93s -> 7838.73s]  I want if you want to know it'll cost you oh I believe it will the price I pay won't be to you
[7838.73s -> 7844.38s]  no we've a bigger deal to settle I don't doubt that you are working with Phineas but my contract
[7844.38s -> 7849.18s]  specifies I relay any acquired information to the purchaser and to the purchaser alone
[7850.46s -> 7855.18s]  however if you send the data I will need your assistance in cycling the antennas
[7855.18s -> 7863.90s]  everyone always needs you to do something like okay how do you hook up with you
[7864.46s -> 7868.70s]  tell me how to fix it and I bet I have a whole new checklist of crap to do before it works right
[7869.58s -> 7875.18s]  do it yourself first I never leave the tower no exceptions well you will be in a body bag
[7876.22s -> 7880.22s]  in about 10 minutes you don't do here to key in the sequence to the tower system when it resets
[7880.22s -> 7885.66s]  or the calibration will fail normally I'd beg Neoka to do the honors but it appears she's
[7885.66s -> 7891.34s]  following your lead now it's simple truly I merely need you to waltz outside and throw
[7891.34s -> 7896.30s]  the lever to cycle the power I'll key in the numerical adjustments if that is not what I
[7896.30s -> 7911.46s]  have to do if that's not it then this guy's gonna die just press the lever outside that's it someone
[7911.46s -> 7917.70s]  has trust issues though I can't hardly feign surprise yes that is all no I am not mocking you
[7918.34s -> 7925.77s]  much just step outside lock the door on me the switch depart forever understood good marvelous
[7925.77s -> 7930.17s]  we're in agreement this is why I stopped helping out I'm gonna close the door and lock it it's
[7930.17s -> 7935.21s]  always throw this lever shoot that marauder save my life just one thing after another with you
[7940.57s -> 7949.43s]  don't burst a blood vessel I'll give whatever terrific I'll be here waiting with bated breath
[7949.43s -> 7957.90s]  give a shout if the panel electrocutes you it's hard to not do it all right just press the button
[7961.30s -> 7967.48s]  you don't know that I have time travel mechanics see right now I just put a time travel spot right
[7967.48s -> 7972.20s]  here because if you close the door and lock it on me I'm just gonna time travel back and kill you
[7978.79s -> 7985.32s]  all right let's see what happens here that's cheating that's not cheating that's holding
[7985.32s -> 7988.68s]  your hand in the choose your own adventure book with your finger in between the pages
[7989.32s -> 8007.56s]  testing one check check but that's it I was gonna start saying all kinds of
[8007.56s -> 8022.26s]  fucked up stuff oh and I also dispatched Vinny as his data it'll make me come back in there
[8022.26s -> 8027.88s]  there's no need to assert your dominance I doubt I could make you do anything you don't wish
[8027.88s -> 8033.40s]  look I am well aware that at times I may have the tiniest iota of a prickly exterior
[8033.40s -> 8041.59s]  but I must admit I have grown rather fond of you as Neoka can attest I do not form attachments
[8042.95s -> 8048.15s]  do take care why he told us to leave without flinging insults at our purses
[8048.71s -> 8058.74s]  he really does like you captain well I don't like him we blasted hell is that told you no
[8058.74s -> 8076.82s]  somebody just like somebody just crashed what was that whose ship was that
[8077.70s -> 8089.08s]  it's one of the board's blockade oh whatever oh maybe they'll be all right I agree
[8089.08s -> 8101.56s]  they're like invading each other's channels
[8113.64s -> 8118.60s]  10 over here 10 over here 10 over here everybody gets some time on the radio
[8118.60s -> 8122.10s]  you can't hog the game oh it's a reunion
[8143.03s -> 8146.04s]  uh you're acting like children
[8146.44s -> 8157.56s]  half of the course really while you still could use its targeting module
[8157.56s -> 8159.40s]  imagine turning on the radio and hearing this
[8161.56s -> 8192.73s]  private channel guys can I say something over the internet broadcast we did it I did it see
[8192.73s -> 8211.66s]  where the ship looks I don't care captain hi return time is within 14 percent of the expected
[8212.14s -> 8213.18s]  I want to talk to Phineas
[8225.42s -> 8229.35s]  it's the first time I've been here too this is new area new content
[8233.53s -> 8235.45s]  all right let's go back to the original dentist crew
[8247.13s -> 8255.96s]  hello can you hear me does this work damn it blasted I'm just securing my ongoing experiments
[8256.92s -> 8260.70s]  get off the radio you're on the same wavelength
[8261.50s -> 8269.05s]  visitors since in fact I've never had a visitor I have now
[8274.47s -> 8277.91s]  shrink ray science weapons are unique weapons that have strange and powerful
[8277.91s -> 8281.75s]  effects science weapon damage and the strength of their effects both increases your science skill
[8281.75s -> 8308.63s]  increases did they get a funny voice that's all I care about max you know what to do
[8309.43s -> 8318.92s]  remind the wall of bulletproof glass I don't know how you did it
[8318.92s -> 8326.20s]  but Hiram Blythe just sent me everything I needed nice I did it according to Hiram's message
[8326.20s -> 8342.70s]  minister Clark has ordered a suspended time of scarcity once I have those chemicals we can
[8342.70s -> 8350.14s]  revive the hopes colonists and put some decent people in charge so good news you're going to
[8351.10s -> 8360.02s]  seriously those chemicals exciting okay what's so important about these chemicals
[8360.90s -> 8378.06s]  that is the reason you're essential to reviving the hopes colonists okay I need you to steal as
[8378.06s -> 8390.02s]  much as you possibly can imagine getting along better will stop the board from destroying this
[8390.02s -> 8398.60s]  colony all right so what's the plan ah yes the detail I'm not about to ask you to rampage
[8398.60s -> 8403.62s]  through presenting bullets with the board's agents we'll have to resort to subterfuge
[8418.04s -> 8433.67s]  thankfully I don't have to drop ten thousand dollars to get it find Carmen
[8435.59s -> 8457.50s]  steel chemicals got it you're lucky you behind the glass tested if it's bulletproof
[8458.79s -> 8463.86s]  I know it's bulletproof turn the shrink ray on yourself
[8464.50s -> 8473.98s]  you can't do that I will try it though I mean it's like a funny laugh out loud weapon right
[8482.84s -> 8493.98s]  how many what is it 1300 ammo yes there what happened
[8500.73s -> 8501.85s]  what is going on

[8581.99s -> 8586.15s]  further than I got in the game good night well see you later hope you have fun with the rest of the
[8586.15s -> 8596.20s]  game massive spoiler coming up this is the part of the game when Phineas actually rips off a
[8596.20s -> 8604.23s]  rubber mask and he's the bad guy the whole time hey Carmen do you mind I'm needing someone
[8604.95s -> 8613.98s]  I'm sorry we're gonna have to part ways uh what a coincidence me too I oh oh you mean I'm supposed

[8629.21s -> 8635.22s]  guarded so has it got to be a way to catch the minister someplace less protected can you get me
[8635.22s -> 8639.06s]  into the minister's estate how exactly did you get involved in all this there's got to be a way
[8639.06s -> 8643.70s]  to catch him somewhere afraid not he almost never leaves his home and his guards never leave him
[8644.66s -> 8651.51s]  can you get me in there whoa I'm not one of your bne specialists I just provide intelligence
[8654.90s -> 8667.58s]  vulgar eater birds are kind of my specialty code names too but I can give you some information
[8668.70s -> 8672.30s]  some of the guards hang around Billingsley's house of inebriation between shifts
[8672.30s -> 8676.54s]  okay so they get drunk maybe you could do some reconnaissance there you know swipe a key while
[8676.54s -> 8684.79s]  nobody's looking a booger and a booger and eating specialist thanks for the tip just remember you

[8824.71s -> 8842.39s]  to the let's go to the minister's guard do you think I'm cuckoo I could spend hours reflecting
[8842.39s -> 8858.76s]  on the secret working so tell me not your cuckoo long elevator ride something exciting happened
[8859.00s -> 8866.26s]  here for once nothing wrong with stability it means everything's running like clockwork
[8866.26s -> 8871.50s]  don't you ever want a little maybe see a marauder ship get blown to bits overhead
[8872.62s -> 8887.56s]  what a thing I got content for you I can't jump I was gonna jump over okay get away from get away

[8937.77s -> 8945.51s]  can't be wrong what are you offering I'm making a feature space pirates of moros prime I get to be
[8945.51s -> 8952.95s]  in a movie but we still need a star and I think you got the chops I'll do it no job is too great
[8952.95s -> 8959.83s]  too grueling or too gruesome for a Sam he's not talking to you model there might want to lease him
[8959.83s -> 8965.51s]  for a Macbeth production no no I'm the one that I'm the one what do you say let's do it ready for
[8965.51s -> 8972.79s]  the chance of a lifetime yes terrific we're holding auditions at the studio head to Odeon

[8981.51s -> 9006.65s]  let's go FPS city all cleaning jobs have been in FPS city be a fool I'd have to request a
[9006.65s -> 9013.21s]  counter waiver and you know how dreadful the paperwork is don't I ever my dear fellow why
[9013.21s -> 9018.57s]  I spent three hours filing a discussion authorization just to commence our little
[9019.05s -> 9032.90s]  test how we suffer in the name of commerce no I don't know what accent this is but it's in every
[9032.90s -> 9042.46s]  single thing that is referencing older potentially wealthy people what is that accent oh my dear boy
[9042.46s -> 9049.02s]  this is not English or American it's something strange in between it's as if you took a record
[9049.02s -> 9066.10s]  and held your finger on it while you try to play it back normally it's the monopoly man accent
[9069.18s -> 9080.30s]  that's a warped there's a warped record it's about that accent is the mid-atlantic accent
[9080.30s -> 9085.10s]  it's a cultivated accent of English blending together prestigious American and British English
[9085.82s -> 9090.54s]  ways of speaking adopted in the early 20th century by mostly by American aristocrats and actors
[9090.54s -> 9098.18s]  there's not native vernacular or regional American accent wait they were doing that on purpose
[9102.97s -> 9121.54s]  that's a fake accent really it was Americans larping as British
[9124.92s -> 9132.28s]  so that was just Americans doing a poor bad British accent role-playing
[9136.52s -> 9146.62s]  wow all right let's go time for my audition British people do it too what why do British
[9146.94s -> 9175.61s]  pretend to have a British accent wait hold on what why do okay got it you should know I drank

[9244.14s -> 9250.20s]  to enemies within 2.5 meters damn you can attack after killing an enemy your next attack that's
[9250.20s -> 9255.78s]  killing is a gap I don't even need to see the other ones all right you guys have some levels
[9255.78s -> 9268.98s]  up to do charges should I give him the funny weapon ability damage yeah I want you that
[9268.98s -> 9280.31s]  ability is just powerful let's see damage to auto mechanicals chance to resist ability cooldown
[9280.31s -> 9287.62s]  on ability use ability damage swap reload and weapon swap let's just make you a beast
[9290.97s -> 9303.67s]  okay uh it's time for me to be an actor I'm supposed to be natural okay I'm gonna bad just

[9401.94s -> 9407.94s]  I won't let you get away with this whatever as long as you stop monologuing how did cnp manage
[9407.94s -> 9414.58s]  to fit more in something so tiny they're geniuses jokes on you idiot those crates are just decoys
[9414.58s -> 9422.17s]  they they are what an unexpected twist you may have fooled me for now but not for long
[9422.97s -> 9429.00s]  which side is my good side do you remember the last time we faced each other out of character
[9429.32s -> 9436.52s]  come on staring one another down across the void of space while flaming debris felt like rain
[9436.52s -> 9446.87s]  around us the thing you just described are scientifically impossible hey I didn't write
[9446.87s -> 9453.11s]  this just go with it I had you surrounded and outgunned but you overcame my superior numbers
[9453.11s -> 9458.95s]  with tactical thinking and a hammersmith limited edition grenade launcher yeah I've been waiting

[9502.60s -> 9508.98s]  ah most of those words are made up and the ones that are real don't work like that
[9510.58s -> 9516.50s]  the script is awful and I spent three hours learning how to pronounce them terrible writing

[10954.07s -> 10960.71s]  minister Clark what a remarkable honor it is to meet you if this is about another wave clip
[10960.71s -> 10966.63s]  or radio spot you may kindly fuck off as the parlance goes I'm not doing anymore
[10967.35s -> 10978.36s]  oh cut the crap I'm here for the self oxide oh of course what else would it be I don't have any
[10978.36s -> 10986.28s]  drugs you should try a vending machine or a purveyor of curative goods what is this system
[10986.28s -> 10992.92s]  coming to when even the earth minister is disillusioned beyond hope will that be all
[10992.92s -> 10999.48s]  there why do you keep talking like that they're getting denser by the day
[11001.00s -> 11012.76s]  I shall endeavor to speak more slowly is this better slower and louder into my good ear what
[11012.76s -> 11020.34s]  was that a joke sarcasm even oh this is such a relief you've no idea how long it's been since
[11020.34s -> 11027.02s]  I spoke with someone intelligent enough for irony great so how about you tell me about those
[11027.02s -> 11034.34s]  chemicals this again I really don't know about any chemicals process of elimination the only other
[11034.34s -> 11042.34s]  person with access of course of course it's Rockwell again who else and I thought he was
[11042.34s -> 11050.39s]  only holding me here to keep me out of the way what I mean you're locked up here you are a quick
[11050.39s -> 11057.10s]  study indeed I've long suspected Rockwell of transacting business in my name but this proves
[11057.10s -> 11062.38s]  it he's attempting to game the system but he won't be able to get away with it forever
[11062.94s -> 11069.74s]  eventually Rockwell's house of cards will topple I dearly hope so and you might be part of the
[11069.74s -> 11077.98s]  equation okay one dart you hear Rockwell through the window just into his neck
[11079.86s -> 11085.78s]  and that fucking syringe is full of salicylic acid it'll kill him less than five minutes
[11086.58s -> 11093.19s]  why would he go through all this trouble should I know I've been under house arrest for years
[11094.07s -> 11100.36s]  but there is a way to find out and perhaps to set things right whatever Rockwell's doing
[11100.36s -> 11106.12s]  he'll be doing it from the HHC headquarters your best lead is to look for details in his office
[11107.37s -> 11112.09s]  captain we must investigate Rockwell an injustice like this cannot go unchecked
[11112.73s -> 11120.41s]  I trust max it cannot I can't trust the urgency of the matter if it's dirty it's a job for Sam
[11121.05s -> 11128.18s]  it's filthy indeed my mechanical friend rife with the worst sort of corruption why this is
[11128.18s -> 11138.33s]  starting to sound like an issue of dissident hunter we're discussing you're too excited
[11138.33s -> 11145.53s]  espionage legal redress a possible salvation of halcyon is this not exhilarating
[11146.89s -> 11151.13s]  also this is the longest conversation I've had with someone else in quite some time
[11153.06s -> 11159.98s]  uh if you're the best we have to offer we're screwed I assure you I didn't ask to be locked
[11159.98s -> 11166.46s]  up and made to perform like a trained animal but I'm attempting to make the best of an opportunity
[11166.46s -> 11172.86s]  I only hope you can do the same now we've got to get into the HHC that's in the Acropolis district
[11172.86s -> 11178.36s]  along with the other major corporate and government facilities but only board employees
[11178.36s -> 11183.72s]  corporations government government corporation guarded checkpoint just down the street the board
[11183.72s -> 11188.68s]  there might be a route through the maintenance tunnels but I'm afraid I don't know specifics
[11188.68s -> 11197.26s]  most people avoid the area for obvious reasons a few guards don't scare me that's good because
[11197.26s -> 11203.10s]  there are sure to be more at headquarters when you reach the HHC building this access card should
[11203.10s -> 11207.58s]  get you up to the executive suites where the chairman's office and what used to be my office
[11207.58s -> 11216.54s]  are how did you hold on to your access car keys are none too bright I simply claimed I'd lost it
[11216.54s -> 11222.12s]  and hid it somewhere no one would think to look government corporations corporate government
[11224.41s -> 11230.25s]  all right I should get going wait rockwell has one of the only terminals capable of transmitting
[11230.25s -> 11237.05s]  to the earthbound message drone this is our chance please take this and transmit it from
[11237.05s -> 11242.89s]  his office rockwell hasn't given me any messages from earth for years he's desperate to keep me
[11242.89s -> 11247.37s]  out of contact with the earth directorate but they need to know what's happening here
[11250.30s -> 11255.18s]  all right you can count on me is in dire need of someone like you
[11260.92s -> 11268.15s]  hey everything in the in you it's a bolter pistol it's the revamp the refined byzantine
[11285.40s -> 11304.04s]  all right what is that plus five skills range weapon skills plus five that's pretty good

[11334.87s -> 11341.62s]  a book in the shape of cheese what's the cheese book what's the cake book what is that
[11344.86s -> 11353.90s]  that's freaking me out how do you read that book that's a magician's book yeah there's like
[11354.54s -> 11370.76s]  look at all this weird stuff here all right so get access to this person's office and
[11370.76s -> 11388.20s]  yell at them and scream at them down there the chairman's office pizza is the shape of
[11388.20s -> 11403.38s]  a triangle so press triangle if it were only that easy oh there right there can't you just
[11403.46s -> 11409.67s]  see the stench of impropriety radiating off of him for the last time access to
[11409.67s -> 11416.82s]  besant him is impossible without a proper analogy now if you'll excuse me i need to be
[11418.26s -> 11431.26s]  somewhere else how much have you ever lost on a coin toss how about i don't understand it's a
[11431.26s -> 11443.90s]  simple question how much i don't know maybe i can't reckon i'd say you can sir how splendid
[11443.90s -> 11449.42s]  another rung leech wandering through the streets of besantium why just this morning i thought to
[11449.42s -> 11454.54s]  myself as lovely as the gardens are what they really need is more greasy vagrants
[11454.54s -> 11466.09s]  frolicking through them and here you are frolicking gracefully might i add what a
[11466.09s -> 11469.29s]  coincidence just now i thought i'd really like to sock this lady in the face
[11475.80s -> 11481.56s]  how utterly expected you must be one of those violent vagrants i've heard tell of wandering
[11481.56s -> 11486.60s]  the system in search of brutality honestly what is the board thinking letting so many of your
[11486.60s -> 11496.87s]  ilk into the city proper it's madness if the board isn't supposed to let people into the city how did
[11496.87s -> 11503.43s]  you get here i earned my place here just like everyone else my grandfather was the cio at tile
[11503.43s -> 11512.98s]  you see cio chief idea officer he came up with all the best ideas for their products you know
[11512.98s -> 11517.78s]  the font they use for stogie slits that was him so you mean the guy that showed up to work
[11517.78s -> 11525.70s]  once a month their font development team in socks and sandals a blazer it was a very long list
[11529.50s -> 11535.34s]  oh what did he come up with let's see he picked the colors they included in rainbow chips no one
[11535.34s -> 11542.06s]  else wanted purple but he insisted everyone loves the purple ones and you know how the cosmic smokes
[11542.06s -> 11546.78s]  logo has an eye in the middle of a heptagon he said that one came to him in a dream
[11547.98s -> 11551.90s]  he was a true visionary so far ahead of his time
[11554.95s -> 11560.31s]  wait but what did you do i just told you my grandfather made millions of bits as cio
[11560.31s -> 11578.42s]  and i earned them from him so you came into it you married into it of course it is wealth is
[11578.42s -> 11584.34s]  the most visible objective measure of success and success isn't given to you it's earned my
[11584.34s -> 11589.46s]  grandfather taught me that if you have wealth you're successful and if you're successful you
[11589.46s -> 11594.58s]  must have earned it what time do you close it's a simple concept no what time what time do you close
[11597.37s -> 11600.73s]  i had darker darkness not the time what time do you close
[11606.49s -> 11611.61s]  you're welcome now do we have any further business or are you just here for the repartee
[11614.92s -> 11619.56s]  what's wrong with people what's wrong with you it erodes the very pillars of our society
[11619.56s -> 11628.04s]  merit decorum personal hygiene this city is meant for us the system's finest we earned its luxuries
[11628.76s -> 11633.96s]  but now we are overrun with the unworthy and the ungrateful and this early retirement nonsense is
[11633.96s -> 11640.04s]  making it even worse and that's terrible attitude you shouldn't look down on people like that
[11641.00s -> 11645.75s]  early retirement what are you talking about the worst thing to happen to halcyon
[11645.75s -> 11651.35s]  a contest that gives even the lowliest to most inefficient workers a chance to live in Byzantium
[11651.99s -> 11657.27s]  by simply winning a lottery those early retirees get an exclusive district of Byzantium to
[11657.27s -> 11668.65s]  themselves no one else is even allowed to go there tell me how is that fair life's not fair
[11668.73s -> 11675.13s]  well it should be if you pay enough it's not right i deserve to see any district i please
[11675.69s -> 11682.25s]  why if it weren't guarded i'd hmm you know you look like you've been shot at before
[11682.25s -> 11688.97s]  what say i hire you to investigate this travesty you want to hire me to do so oh we get paid this
[11688.97s -> 11698.33s]  time i like this plan yes listen to your your friend what is that person doesn't seem like you
[11698.33s -> 11703.05s]  have very many are they your secretary personal masseuse or do you just keep them around as a
[11703.05s -> 11708.97s]  mobile armrest well it doesn't matter what's important is that you think this is a fabulous
[11708.97s -> 11717.62s]  arrangement and you'd be thrilled to lend me your services aren't you why would i ever help you
[11717.62s -> 11721.30s]  with something like this did you miss the part where i said i'd pay you that's all the reasons
[11721.30s -> 11729.93s]  someone like you should require i mean it's not i like money but give me something better than that
[11729.93s -> 11738.07s]  better than money let's see there's no the thrill of discovery like in an aetherwave adventure
[11738.07s -> 11742.47s]  people love those right don't you want to see what the retirement district is like
[11747.26s -> 11756.25s]  fine i'll do it but not for the money fantastic consider yourself employed vagrant i hear the
[11756.25s -> 11761.21s]  chosen retirees all enter the retirement district via the port landing pad but it's completely
[11761.21s -> 11767.13s]  locked down you'd never get in that way unless of course you had a wealthy beautiful benefactor

[14282.38s -> 14288.26s]  look around what was it like an endless extravagant garden there were even signs that said no for all
[14288.26s -> 14293.38s]  looking it was just one giant party they had a vodka fountain everything is gold everything's
[14293.38s -> 14302.86s]  made out of gold toothbrushes why that is positively gaudy i must have one yeah it was really cool i
[14302.86s -> 14310.55s]  can't believe they kept this from us from me the nerve the audacity here take your payment
[14310.55s -> 14316.07s]  i have to fetch my things i don't care what i have to do they'll give me luxury or give me death
[14317.03s -> 14326.86s]  preparing body dye for use all right have fun it's a paradise you're gonna love it
[14331.80s -> 14345.37s]  see you on the other side follow i can't that's not in this game that's uh that's complaint
[14346.49s -> 14366.41s]  complaint against game you can't follow anybody all right now we can go back to phineas we've got
[14366.41s -> 14380.36s]  the stuff jerry there's a robot following you monkey s what no way for sore ocular processors
[14380.36s -> 14386.68s]  captain or rather your head you have a message from adjutant sophia akande who's that no one
[14386.92s -> 14392.68s]  looks quite the same in person as they do in my reports and my reports of you have been
[14392.68s -> 14404.66s]  exceptionally thorough you've had quite a career oh let's skip you have something i want
[14405.54s -> 14416.30s]  i'd like to negotiate uh i'm listening phineas wells is wanted by the board i want to convince
[14416.30s -> 14433.30s]  you to turn him in to us okay and what exactly he has a little laughing vandalism illegal
[14433.30s -> 14442.66s]  experiment i could go on he was made to me wells is a dangerous man you're going to endanger
[14442.66s -> 14447.54s]  everyone in health yarn he's an obsessive psychopath he stole a bunch of chemicals
[14447.54s -> 14454.98s]  so now you're in contact with wells i want you to send us a tracing signal from his communication
[14454.98s -> 14465.50s]  terminal cut her off aida thanks can you believe the nerve on that psychopath you know i can still
[14465.50s -> 14472.92s]  hear you right adjutant akande's call has been terminated will there be anything else captain
[14474.62s -> 14480.22s]  uh let's get the fuck out of trace that call and send a virus to your computer please
[14493.58s -> 14498.30s]  if you don't mind my saying captain minister clark is lucky to have you on his side
[14502.02s -> 14527.66s]  don't go rogue on me now i can't i'm afraid of sam all right what densest are we bringing
[14530.47s -> 14550.31s]  i need sam i don't need sam your entire ship is a robot i've got chemicals i've got chemicals
[14551.19s -> 14554.63s]  doctor i've got chemicals i'm bringing them to you i've got them here they are
[14555.35s -> 14575.50s]  install them breathe them experiment on them hey good forget about the chemicals for a second
[14575.50s -> 14578.46s]  the colonies on the verge of collapse i found your chemicals in the ministry the board was
[14578.46s -> 14593.85s]  testing them on human subjects uh i had to let the test subjects die but i brought back
[14593.85s -> 14597.29s]  all the chemicals i put them out of their misery here's your canister of chemicals by the way
[14598.09s -> 14607.82s]  these are both awful um you've brought me enough chemicals to get started at least
[14607.90s -> 14618.54s]  but all of them i'm just sorry they came at the cost of human life to accomplish
[14620.10s -> 14624.66s]  um something about repeatedly melting frozen people there are a lot of big words you know
[14624.66s -> 14662.92s]  how food goes stale if you freeze it too much like that but with people dumb science 40 uh the
[14662.92s -> 14676.50s]  colonies on the verge of collapse the board's been trying to cover it up i know i'm suspect
[14676.50s -> 14680.98s]  what do we do the board's mismanagement put our colony on the road to collapse if we don't put
[14681.06s -> 14688.62s]  a stop to them some of colonists are going to die what do we what do we do it gets worse the
[14688.62s -> 14696.30s]  chairman's planning on freezing every worker in halcyon it's pretty fucked up
[14699.02s -> 14705.80s]  yep and the chairman's plan to save all of us yeah i always knew halcyon was heading
[14705.80s -> 14712.23s]  toward this cause for let's just let's go to chili's and order everything off the menu might as well
[14721.50s -> 14736.46s]  then i'll stop it the board's going to kill them all we need to think about this there has to be
[14736.46s -> 14739.18s]  something we can do that's it we just give up all the trouble went through for another
[14739.18s -> 14742.54s]  this colony's a mess i'll be glad to put it behind me as soon as i get a chance whoa
[14743.34s -> 14772.49s]  we got to be something we can do let's go cut them off we need to get to those colonists
[14780.36s -> 14783.40s]  would have been a lot easier if you just set up your lab next to the hope
[14788.28s -> 14805.00s]  yeah i like it just wait until you hear the details i haven't been this energized since
[14805.00s -> 14820.81s]  the time i injected myself with raw cap and all if we skip the entire third act of the game
[14820.81s -> 14825.61s]  and that's going to work and get to the yelling us in the process i thought interest system
[14825.61s -> 14842.58s]  micro jumps were prohibited for a reason experimental methods for killing noxious
[14842.58s -> 14847.30s]  life forms are not covered under this unit's limited liability agreement
[14847.86s -> 14854.82s]  well said whatever you are hey you'll need to switch auxiliary power using the unreliable
[14854.82s -> 14874.74s]  then head to the bridge i can't wait for the germa rumble 2019 or 20
[14875.62s -> 14882.30s]  when it's the dentist versus somebody else in the tag match interesting i think let's do it
[14882.30s -> 14887.40s]  i know you're wondering why i'm doing all this the people on the hope are the answer to the
[14887.40s -> 14918.36s]  cost problems hope is carrying some of humanity okay by the way why are you hiding behind bullet
[14918.36s -> 14925.85s]  proof glass it took me this long what being frozen into your brain that is bullshit that's
[14925.85s -> 14931.45s]  why i don't desire to end up like that's an absolute that's regardless it's quite comfortable
[14931.45s -> 14941.10s]  you know i have my beans have my caffeinoids plenty of toilet paper all right level 20 i
[14941.10s -> 14952.31s]  thought this was a big brain oh what's wrong with me all right i'm standing next to something i'm
[14952.31s -> 14966.31s]  terrified of 12 13 to 9 26 okay you gotta go you gotta go you're out of here i'm sorry i need a new
[14966.31s -> 14987.93s]  dentist let's just make it work let's get to like a hundred like 80 reduce damage from area
[14987.93s -> 15002.55s]  thickened plasma more carrying capacity this one's not terrible more damage with low health that's
[15002.55s -> 15021.34s]  pretty good yeah i'll do it and you show time damage plus 25 increases the damage dealt by
[15021.34s -> 15039.13s]  this companion after performing show time yeah sam it's been fun see you later goodbye you can
[15039.13s -> 15058.09s]  stay on the ship and there's a pig over here oh wow it's an omega pig i don't think those things
[15058.09s -> 15067.10s]  existed all right let's go let's let's do it let's actually do this let's let's do this
[15067.66s -> 15091.30s]  let's go for it keep sam no sam scares me hope talking i hope dr wells has not
[15091.30s -> 15097.30s]  dragged you into one of his irrational schemes again my diagnosis of his mental stability is
[15098.02s -> 15108.47s]  not flattering you want to be ceo hope let's go to the hope
[15112.49s -> 15118.01s]  we have arrived at the hope i need you to reroute power from our ship to the hopes auxiliary
[15118.01s -> 15123.45s]  generator you'll have to connect me to the hopes comm system so i can convince her central computer
[15123.45s -> 15129.50s]  to enable the skip drive we're gonna get a robot fight an ai fight what's gonna happen if i skip
[15129.50s -> 15135.10s]  the hope your calculations are even slightly off you could crash the entire colony ship into terra
[15135.10s -> 15141.05s]  two for the sun oh good thing i'm great at math i know all the best numbers
[15141.69s -> 15146.41s]  i must recommend you leave the calculations up to me captain there's so many numbers so
[15146.41s -> 15152.31s]  many big numbers you have the best numbers in brackets trump
[15157.50s -> 15163.21s]  all right that's all for now well talk to that computer and let us know how it goes
[15172.47s -> 15194.70s]  i like your special move breathe down my neck why don't you okay hope power hope comes
[15203.00s -> 15212.49s]  packs yeah power is now being ruled from the docking bay patch ada into the hopes communication
[15212.49s -> 15225.35s]  system status power cool maintenance looks good hibernation storage seems all right logs cool
[15229.58s -> 15238.62s]  ship puts me on edge captain you know what you're doing i don't who are you i hear someone snuck
[15238.62s -> 15254.07s]  into the repository who the hell is this all right coms oh we have to talk to oh quincy duncan you
[15254.07s -> 15259.75s]  know when they posted us here i told him there wasn't any point nobody would be so stupid as
[15259.75s -> 15266.41s]  to fly to the ass end of the colony for this derelict shows how much i know you've got about
[15266.41s -> 15270.25s]  five seconds to tell me what you're doing here before i make you take a walk outside
[15273.14s -> 15277.98s]  uh i was sent to repair the reactor so it doesn't explode and take out the colony
[15279.02s -> 15282.78s]  they sent me to extract a few samples from your uh frozen cargo it's gross
[15283.66s -> 15293.05s]  an engineer life explode holy shit all right you'll want a uniform so my staff doesn't shoot you on
[15293.85s -> 15298.97s]  they're dangerous it makes a board and trigger happy we've got a few extra in the old badge
[15298.97s -> 15324.73s]  station to my right good luck thank you to your right to my right right okay well that looks
[15326.09s -> 15337.06s]  did i tell you everything uh all right this whole starving of that thing isn't all that
[15337.06s -> 15340.58s]  cracked up to be on the upside the bathroom is the cleanest they've ever been since we left port
[15341.54s -> 15362.70s]  oh all right do i have a do i have one you just need the id card oh all right let's break some
[15362.70s -> 15372.07s]  of this shit down all right i'm gonna sell your robes no i don't anti riot gear i mean it's cool
[15372.07s -> 15386.17s]  but i don't need two of them i put guns a lot of just 350 that's not man it's terrible now that's
[15386.17s -> 15396.55s]  pretty cool i'm gonna give that to the priest stun baton ultra i gotta give some better weapons
[15397.43s -> 15403.83s]  because the things that they have kind of suck yeah all right here i need a
[15404.95s -> 15415.26s]  you what do you have you good with melee no you're the melee here and take this instead
[15415.26s -> 15421.62s]  take the flamethrower let's go no that doesn't make any sense for you that's out of character
[15421.62s -> 15434.54s]  for you you don't have two handed guns keep the tactical shotgun you use the flamethrower
[15434.54s -> 15454.92s]  where'd it go and the stun baton now we're ready let's do uh harmful status effects all right
[15460.23s -> 15466.81s]  thank you so why is this some kind of weird disguised costume thing when the guy just told
[15466.81s -> 15475.19s]  me hey you're a new recruit why do i have this costume i'm supposed to be here what what i'm
[15475.19s -> 15481.10s]  supposed to be here you get tired of patrolling just go rough somebody up that's bad advice
[15481.10s -> 15531.66s]  guys excuse me i'm almost out of juice out of juice i can't lie to a robot robot communications
[15541.42s -> 15547.98s]  wait wait it wants to talk to me it wanted it said it wanted to talk to me it said it wanted to talk
[15548.78s -> 15556.23s]  there was a hey i have to ask you a question it said like hey i have to ask you talking
[15560.20s -> 15585.69s]  i took too long what oh i i i no i didn't say i i i i said i i i
[15606.62s -> 15612.38s]  can you hear me captain i have successfully integrated myself into the hopes con systems
[15612.38s -> 15619.27s]  and i'm attempting to establish contact with the hopes more primitive processor now would you
[15619.27s -> 15625.91s]  like me to play a mood suitable music selection while you travel to the bridge oh sorry file not
[15625.91s -> 15635.26s]  found i'm currently trying to not get spotted by these monsters i need some i need okay i need to
[15635.26s -> 15671.10s]  talk to somebody i need somebody to see me that's not a robot well that was a good little skip
[15678.44s -> 15701.03s]  wait can i is this correct is taking me home i think so oh there we go have a nice day
[15701.03s -> 15712.12s]  okay that's the hopes computer up ahead i'll admit i am curious to wake him i hope you guys
[15713.75s -> 15720.79s]  work it out patch ada through i am speaking to you through the hopes computer system
[15720.79s -> 15730.86s]  it's a rather cramped feeling but it'll do i'm ready to skip hope tell me am i really doing
[15730.86s -> 15737.42s]  the right thing i don't want no i'm ready to skip hope are you sure that is extremely dangerous
[15737.90s -> 15744.44s]  skipping the hope will void the warranty on the skip drive and also potentially kill an entire
[15744.44s -> 15755.16s]  planet how is my humor now captain improved skip jump starting the skip drive destination set to
[15755.16s -> 15767.21s]  the rings of terra 2 jumping destination okay do it if we're meant to make it we will no use worrying
[15767.21s -> 15777.21s]  otherwise doing it i mean affirmative skipping the hope in three two one ada does your captain
[15777.21s -> 15783.37s]  seriously intend to do a micro jump in system with engines that haven't been powered in 70 years
[15783.37s -> 15791.61s]  on a derelict ship that's what my captain intends yes but that is a gross misuse of the skip drive
[15791.61s -> 15796.57s]  the zero point drives corp and i will not be held responsible for any damage incurred during
[15796.57s -> 15804.65s]  transport and this will cause extreme damage yes i am aware of that you should not be doing
[15804.65s -> 15812.01s]  this the humans will die thank you hope it looks like all systems are go captain i would advise
[15812.01s -> 15837.61s]  you to hold on to something what when you hold on to something all right bring them home
[15837.61s -> 15854.12s]  home why is it pointing at the sun into the sun
[15865.24s -> 15870.12s]  it made it we are still alive and have successfully skipped into terra 2's orbit
[15870.68s -> 15876.36s]  i reported as much to vinius wells but he has not responded perhaps you should check in on him
[15876.36s -> 15890.92s]  i will we made it all right everyone's alive look okay good let's do a little bit of
[15892.44s -> 15903.34s]  let's get handguns to 80 debuffed enemy critical chance minus 20 percent and let's put lie i have
[15903.34s -> 15931.66s]  108 lie now no one's gonna get anything by me nice work uh catch me being bad no not you
[15932.30s -> 15954.42s]  the puman so i could get my disguise back error crew data not found identify yourself
[15955.96s -> 15959.64s]  i was in one of the pods i just woke up if you're experiencing errors just take you to a mechanical
[15959.64s -> 15965.56s]  engineer this statement is false paradox protection protocols have prevented me from
[15965.56s -> 15972.60s]  registering your stated identification please we can't lie to robots mechanical engineer they
[15972.60s -> 15978.60s]  don't know what it is everything i say is false error paradox prevention has temporarily disabled
[15978.60s -> 15991.59s]  this unit's auditory processing thank you for your cooperation you're welcome back to the lab
[15991.59s -> 16012.73s]  can i teleport no nope i killed him there's no you don't kill a robot they just unplug
[16013.45s -> 16029.66s]  this is the wrong fucking area excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me
[16034.33s -> 16046.71s]  excuse me i don't recognize you are you new here on your own business what's your problem
[16049.16s -> 16052.04s]  you relax i'm not looking for a fight
[16060.63s -> 16070.58s]  all right here we go all right all right all right all right all right all right okay
[16071.14s -> 16092.17s]  just get out of here how do i get back in my ship there's a tiny little bridge uh what is
[16092.17s -> 16111.03s]  colder than cold freon captain i am receiving a transmission from dr wells captain i shall now
[16111.03s -> 16117.59s]  play the transmission before you get the bad thing oh they found me somehow they're about
[16117.59s -> 16125.42s]  you got that glass from getting me and there isn't enough time to explain everything and very
[16125.42s -> 16132.46s]  important you need to rest the board all their lackeys they're all a bunch of swine do you hear
[16132.46s -> 16142.55s]  me they're fucking corporate swine you fucking pigs i'll take you all out with me i'll never
[16142.55s -> 16148.23s]  it would seem the recording captured some rather dire events i presume you want to dock at the
[16148.23s -> 16153.19s]  orbital lab to check on your associate as soon as possible how can i be of assistance
[16154.78s -> 16165.00s]  uh can you make cereal or something i haven't eaten in 12 days sandwich a ham or anything
[16168.02s -> 16174.50s]  i have lots of minutes many minutes unlimited minutes perhaps providing an adequate power
[16174.50s -> 16181.91s]  source i can function indefinitely cool uh tell me about the captain tell me tell me this i put
[16181.91s -> 16186.31s]  my feet up on the chair and fold them tell me what about that captain i require a captain to pilot
[16186.31s -> 16193.91s]  the ship without an identified captain or crew i serve no purpose as you may be aware captain alex
[16193.91s -> 16199.99s]  hawthorne was a smuggler of some repute i failed to predict the likely outcome of his reckless
[16199.99s -> 16206.71s]  behavioral patterns i should have predicted that outlaw in our travels together alex liked to
[16206.71s -> 16218.73s]  pass time by as he called it tinkering to improve my design okay i'm done i guess we'll go check on
[16218.73s -> 16230.09s]  phineas phineas i'm coming to save you he's arrived in phineas's orbital lab all right
[16231.05s -> 16241.62s]  let me just take care of business again and we're gonna bring the dream team even if i'm scared
[16242.26s -> 16274.02s]  did they get them no alchemy books they left the pig um they can't get in how can they know this
[16279.80s -> 16283.72s]  as per official arrest protocol outlined in defense logistic incarceration document
[16284.36s -> 16288.12s]  the individual who's been detained at this location must appear in an official halcyon court
[16288.76s -> 16293.56s]  at the appointed date and time with this paperwork and failure to appear at the appointed date and
[16293.56s -> 16299.22s]  time with this paperwork will result in additional late fees please know that this is the only copy

[17685.30s -> 17689.86s]  man in the colony remarkable i just want to make sure because when they find your teeth lying around
[17689.86s -> 17695.94s]  they'll be able to identify you then again he's an insane person thankfully he's our insane person

[17708.23s -> 17714.60s]  an extraordinarily obstinate fellow isn't he he isn't working for us per se semantics he'll come
[17714.60s -> 17721.08s]  around but that's between us as far as my adoring citizens will know we've turned a dangerous
[17721.08s -> 17728.62s]  crackpot into a working-class man it's a miracle is this the i feel like i haven't had enough time to
[17728.62s -> 17734.60s]  care that this guy's a villain it was just like this guy's chairman rockwell and here's a video

[17748.18s -> 17753.06s]  it's for the best really believe me the good people of Byzantium don't want to know what
[17753.06s -> 17759.66s]  goes on here i know halcyon's in rough shape but riots are the last thing anybody needs right now
[17760.78s -> 17765.98s]  another thing captain have you at any point why we're tight not fucking up our entire society

[17773.34s -> 17780.04s]  you're just getting in the way you'd rather you prefer to keep writing this down as far
[17780.04s -> 17786.84s]  i can fix this place i can do it if i and my people can write it out in luxury and happiness
[17786.84s -> 17793.16s]  yes yes i would i don't know if you've noticed captain but halcyon's pretty much a lost cause
[17793.16s -> 17800.90s]  oh well the problem is i've already rallied all of Byzantium against you
[17801.62s -> 17808.71s]  they're outside waiting and they're angry you you have is that what you were doing at the ministry
[17809.35s -> 17816.02s]  i'm not an unreasonable man if you manage to storm the castle as it were and make it out of here
[17816.02s -> 17824.60s]  with phineas alive i can't exactly afford more havoc than you've already caused fine if you survive
[17825.24s -> 17830.12s]  you'll need someone to sell the rest of the board on your plan right because it'll be me
[17831.32s -> 17843.48s]  uh you're damn right right you just wait here for my orders hey and tell your tell your dog to stop

[17915.42s -> 17922.73s]  you've disrupted the balance of power you've upset the natural order of things you've introduced
[17922.73s -> 17926.73s]  uncertainty and there is nothing i despise more than uncertainty
[17928.89s -> 17934.49s]  it's over sophia stand down we are liberating halcyon and there's not a damn thing you can do
[17934.49s -> 17940.25s]  to stop us wow when you put it that way i sound pretty awesome typical running your mouth in the
[17940.25s -> 17948.01s]  middle of a crisis it's almost as if you delighted chaos my report said you were simple constant
[17948.01s -> 17951.93s]  i simply never imagined you'd be stupid enough to throw the entire system
[17951.93s -> 17959.93s]  into chaos i should have dealt with you a long time ago you were always too dangerous to leave
[17959.93s -> 17967.99s]  unchecked okay i got a colony safe stop you're making me blush uh can we hurry this up i've got
[17967.99s -> 17975.03s]  an entire colony to save leaving you alive was my greatest mistake but it is a mistake i intend

[18085.74s -> 18089.50s]  and there's nothing you can do to stop it's time to let go i'm not throwing halcyon into chaos the
[18089.50s -> 18095.74s]  board's doing that all by themselves the board is the only power left in halcyon we're the only
[18095.74s -> 18102.06s]  ones keeping this colony from dissolving into ruin you had so much potential i would have put
[18102.06s -> 18108.38s]  your talents to good use i would have made you wealthy beyond belief was this the matrix

[18342.70s -> 18347.42s]  the thing funny you should say that because the chairman was just telling me that this is all your
[18347.42s -> 18358.36s]  fault rockwell said that chairman rockwell that's absurd you're lying this is another one of your
[18358.36s -> 18363.56s]  tricks i've been the chairman's most reliable associate good we got we got that info at the
[18363.56s -> 18371.16s]  end of the game uh sophie's been overstepping her bounds his words not mine i've already recruited
[18371.16s -> 18374.68s]  the chairman to my side he's done working with you you let the situation get out of hand rockwell
[18374.68s -> 18383.86s]  once you've gone that's ridiculous halcyon is collapsing the labyrinth is riding you're
[18383.86s -> 18389.62s]  running wild through the colony and i let the situation get out of hand i have given
[18389.62s -> 18395.46s]  that's what he said nothing less than a lifetime of loyal honorable service and this is how he
[18395.46s -> 18403.21s]  repays me by leaving me twisting in the wind everyone's disposable to the board sophie
[18404.01s -> 18412.74s]  even you enough i'm not going to stand here bickering with you i was expecting the chairman's
[18412.74s -> 18418.62s]  support but i'll have to do without he also said i dare you to come trying to shoot me on the program
[18418.62s -> 18426.47s]  yet you've caused some complications but i can improvise i can fix this he said i haven't lost
[18426.47s -> 18432.39s]  control of the lab i bet she can't open the door and fire within a second operational i can still
[18432.39s -> 18437.66s]  put a stop to you no
[18440.38s -> 18445.66s]  i'm sorry i was taking over a security system in the process i'm not a hacker i can't get
[18445.66s -> 18452.82s]  even i can't get to 80 hack i can't get to 80 hack i don't have it no i can't
[18456.49s -> 18465.98s]  game sucks i can't do it i haven't lost control elaborate our security uh i destroyed your
[18465.98s -> 18471.34s]  experiments in the ministry your plan's never gonna work yes i'm quite aware of your brazen
[18471.34s -> 18477.66s]  act of corporate vandalism by the way those test subjects you killed they died in agony
[18479.16s -> 18484.84s]  my scientists assure me they can recover the data you've destroyed you've succeeded in temporarily
[18484.84s -> 18492.63s]  delaying our research nothing more phineas tells me your scientists are hopelessly lost all your
[18492.63s -> 18498.15s]  research is wrong your scientists are lying to you their research is critically flawed your
[18498.23s -> 18504.39s]  scientists are lying i wrecked that data that experiment was badly engineered i'm gonna talk
[18504.39s -> 18510.70s]  about lies we're gonna keep the lies going your scientists are lying to you their research is
[18510.70s -> 18520.38s]  critically flawed i mean it's the research isn't it was terrible it was awful that isn't true
[18521.18s -> 18529.99s]  it can't be you're trying to manipulate me that experiment was absolutely essential to the program
[18530.63s -> 18534.71s]  my scientists assured me they were close to a breakthrough sure you're not surrounded by
[18534.71s -> 18543.70s]  liars gave me their word uh you took the word of a bunch of corporate lab coats and people say
[18543.70s -> 18551.30s]  i'm slow i don't know what pains me more realizing that i've been lied to or hearing the truth from
[18551.30s -> 18557.62s]  an idiot like you we're going to have to start all over again all that research all those
[18557.70s -> 18565.08s]  experiments you've sent us back decades i don't see any reason to continue arguing with you
[18566.12s -> 18570.60s]  i know when i'm beaten the only thing left to do she's surrendering
[18572.52s -> 18581.32s]  congratulations captain you've outplayed me i accept your terms and we return dr wells to your care
[18582.44s -> 18587.00s]  thank you hurry up and leave before i thank you i'm glad we could settle this without violence drop
[18587.00s -> 18592.68s]  the honorable adversary act and fuck off already the fate of the colony is in your hands now
[18593.72s -> 18603.14s]  i bid you farewell captain thank you appreciate it let's go get the key wait are you in that office
[18604.02s -> 18615.86s]  hold on were you talking to me from over there very cool any other people i can lie to
[18618.04s -> 18623.48s]  wait is it wrong my gear oh okay keep it on i might need to lie i might have to continue lying
[18624.20s -> 18659.46s]  oh that was cool hey vinius i'm so glad to see you how did we get you out of there
[18660.34s -> 18678.65s]  come on out you don't know how glad i am to see you you must have said something to get under
[18678.65s -> 18687.08s]  akande's skin she's gone and i don't think she's coming back and you you lunatic you broke into
[18687.08s -> 18693.08s]  the board's own fortress just to rescue one doddering old man you are absolutely out of your
[18693.08s -> 18701.14s]  mind and i can't begin to thank you enough i mean thank the people that just believe everything
[18701.14s -> 18710.28s]  that anyone tells them there is no perception checks or lie checks you just just tell people
[18710.28s -> 18718.90s]  whatever they want to you just have to everyone's so gullible i could tell everybody in this game
[18718.90s -> 18725.62s]  that the sky was not blue that it was green and they wouldn't even look up to confirm it they
[18725.62s -> 18731.78s]  would just go green you say wow that's interesting really green damn i thought it was blue anyways
[18731.78s -> 18745.53s]  here's the key card uh oh yeah the board never stood a chance against me you know i wouldn't
[18745.53s -> 18749.45s]  let anything happen to you vinius do you have any idea how much trouble i went to save you what
[18749.45s -> 18755.53s]  break into the most heavily guarded facility in the most hostile world in halcyon no i have
[18755.53s -> 18762.57s]  absolutely no idea how you did it you're a goddamn miracle worker you've broken the board's
[18762.57s -> 18768.41s]  stranglehold on this colony and you saved my life but there's still so much we have yet to
[18768.41s -> 18775.69s]  accomplish you and i are going to have to work harder than ever to save halcyon i'm afraid the
[18775.69s -> 18784.01s]  situation is far worse than any of us ever anticipated uh i was just about to pop open
[18784.01s -> 18788.81s]  some drinks to celebrate i would like nothing more than to celebrate this victory but we have
[18788.81s -> 18794.98s]  a serious problem on our hands earth has gone you literally walked through everything received a
[18794.98s -> 18801.62s]  single message in three years there's been no communication no signals nothing two years ago
[18801.62s -> 18806.26s]  the earth's directorate's frigate disappeared on their way back to earth we don't know what they
[18806.26s -> 18812.26s]  discovered when they arrived or if they arrived at all they haven't exactly been hands-on around
[18812.26s -> 18818.58s]  here anyway so there's one less rubber stamp to worry about earth is humanity's home planet
[18819.54s -> 18824.02s]  the psychological effects of losing our original home will be devastating
[18825.06s -> 18832.26s]  i got a master liar now this that's it i'm done there is no plan just random
[18832.26s -> 18838.82s]  chaos you're experiencing a crisis of faith preacher don't worry that just means you're
[18838.82s -> 18845.06s]  paying attention we're in serious trouble my friend do you know what this means for halcyon
[18845.06s -> 18851.06s]  we can't rely on earth for support anymore we've been cut loose we're entirely on our own
[18854.23s -> 18860.52s]  we have a lot of work ahead of us we better get started yes we do you've done a marvelous thing
[18860.52s -> 18866.68s]  you've succeeded where anyone else would have failed including me we must begin the revival
[18866.68s -> 18871.56s]  process immediately starting with the hopes of brightest minds and then we're going to fix this
[18871.56s -> 18876.52s]  damn colony one problem at a time wait what do you mean starting we're going to need a leader
[18876.52s -> 18882.60s]  and i can't imagine a better person for the job than you what do you say old friend will you help
[18882.60s -> 18889.30s]  us well you want to be ceo i've got plans with the chairman in my pocket no one's going to know i'm
[18889.30s -> 18893.86s]  running the colony i'm going to run this colony myself i've already convinced the chairman to take
[18893.86s -> 18901.32s]  my side you can count on me i'll help you revive the other colonists i'm going to do what i've
[18901.32s -> 18906.92s]  always done whatever i want all the time huh oh sorry i wasn't listening i was thinking
[18906.92s -> 18913.86s]  about getting some ice cream i see well you've certainly earned a treat for yourself
[18915.40s -> 18920.28s]  i'll just uh get on with reviving the other colonists and saving halcyon then
[18920.28s -> 18932.78s]  okay enjoy your uh creamed ice or whatever you call it chocolate the osi teaches that everything
[18932.78s -> 18939.02s]  in the universe happens according to the grand plan but the stranger that arrived in halcyon
[18939.02s -> 18945.75s]  was an unplanned variable from the moment he landed in emerald vale his actions altered the
[18945.75s -> 18950.71s]  course of history the events on tartarus brought about the end of the board's authority
[18951.51s -> 18958.10s]  but the board's mistakes would haunt the colony for decades to come the damage they left behind
[18958.10s -> 18964.98s]  would require the work of a generation to repair dr finneas wells began reviving a handful of the
[18964.98s -> 18972.26s]  hopes colonists engineers scientists technicians and intellectuals they were among the brightest
[18972.26s -> 18978.10s]  minds the earth had ever sent out into the stars the hope scientists and engineers woke up in a
[18978.10s -> 18986.01s]  colony descending headlong into total collapse with no way to return to earth they had no choice
[18986.01s -> 18992.57s]  but to band together and devote themselves to the cause of saving halcyon did we do it the people
[18992.57s -> 18998.65s]  of halcyon were nothing if not hardy in the absence of the board's authority many of the
[18998.65s -> 19005.69s]  colony settlements and why are we getting a ps4 dashboard add-on for the end of the game was
[19005.69s -> 19011.72s]  especially hard in the years to come some towns dissolved by attrition and starvation
[19012.68s -> 19019.56s]  but most of them found a way to carry on in the years to come halcyon was forced to reckon with
[19019.56s -> 19027.08s]  its newfound freedom the board was gone and for better or worse the colony was responsible for
[19027.08s -> 19034.57s]  its own destiny left unchecked the war on monarch consumed both msi and the iconoclasts
[19035.29s -> 19040.41s]  and when the sulfur clouds settled only stragglers from both factions remained
[19041.61s -> 19047.61s]  some found their way to who is that person who is that person and some lived their final years
[19047.61s -> 19056.01s]  fighting for food in the wilderness in the end only the beasts remained made mcdevitt replaced
[19056.01s -> 19062.97s]  reed tobson as the leader of edgewater she and her followers transformed edgewater in their image
[19063.93s -> 19070.89s]  anyone was pressured into leaving town and those who stayed behind are they omitting stuff from
[19070.89s -> 19078.17s]  history i murdered them transform the old cannery into a new garden the nearby edgewater cemetery
[19078.17s -> 19084.49s]  provided a convenient source of fertilizer it was said that the first corpse that fed her garden
[19084.49s -> 19091.85s]  belonged to reed tobson under the leadership of junley tennyson this is what it is corporate
[19091.85s -> 19097.21s]  influence the ship's mechanical stability gave junley the time to educate a promising
[19097.21s -> 19102.81s]  generation re writing the history schooled in her family so on it's the ultimate line the future of
[19102.81s -> 19109.58s]  the groundbreaker books i'm just this is more line of the hope and the abandonment of the lifetime
[19109.58s -> 19116.14s]  employment program forced byzantium to come to terms with some uncomfortable realities about the
[19116.14s -> 19122.62s]  state of halcyon while byzantines were reluctant to surrender the luxuries they'd grown accustomed to
[19122.70s -> 19128.50s]  the board's diminished authority gave them little choice in the matter no pepe hands nearly everyone
[19128.50s -> 19133.62s]  had to learn to make do with land oh not pepe hands uh no is that pepe hands even had to get
[19133.62s -> 19143.48s]  jobs it was a dark time indeed we savored her adventures on the unreliable once they were done
[19144.04s -> 19150.76s]  she returned to life as usual running missions of dubious legality shunning respectable work
[19151.32s -> 19155.96s]  and living life to the fullest wait we don't we don't talk anymore
[19157.56s -> 19164.68s]  but she was always bad okay after all he'd seen and heard adventuring with you
[19165.40s -> 19171.88s]  the vicar maximilian de soto renounced his faith and joined the effort to rebuild the colony
[19171.88s -> 19176.92s]  ironically he finally found the joy that had eluded him over the course of his life
[19177.56s -> 19182.68s]  and realized that perhaps he was always meant to you made him give up god laborer after all
[19183.56s -> 19189.64s]  he quickly dismissed the idea he ruined his life he left the crew of the unreliable little was
[19189.64s -> 19196.52s]  hurt from her again she exchanged occasional messages with ada but they were light on details
[19196.52s -> 19202.92s]  and grew increasingly infrequent months later her name appeared on the manifest of a research
[19202.92s -> 19209.48s]  vessel that vanished during an unexpected solar storm as hard as she tried to drink them away
[19211.16s -> 19218.12s]  eventually overcame her traveling with a crew served as a that was everybody's favorite character
[19218.12s -> 19223.32s]  i oh you found my favorite character i made her leave within 20 minutes and now she's dead most
[19223.32s -> 19231.82s]  comfortable the deep end of a bottle and the far end of a trail few have seen her since the travelers
[19231.90s -> 19238.78s]  often swear they hear her and her machine gun in the night screaming swears and spitting bullets
[19239.66s -> 19245.42s]  the sam unit that accompanied you spread awareness of the product line superior sanitation and
[19245.42s -> 19252.22s]  maintenance capabilities across what was left of the colony this led to a boost sam's doing okay
[19253.58s -> 19259.50s]  did you know that sam units are the longest lasting toughest acting cleaning solution in alcyon
[19260.46s -> 19266.06s]  minister clark was released from house arrest and his contact with you gave him a sense of renewed
[19266.06s -> 19271.50s]  purpose and figure once it became clear that no help would be coming from earth he threw his
[19271.50s -> 19276.46s]  considerable efforts and talents into helping house yon manage the crisis would just get like
[19276.46s -> 19281.98s]  this epilogue of every person we've ever come across sofia akande was the true power behind
[19281.98s -> 19288.68s]  chairman rockwell however after the riots on tartarus she was never again seen in the colony
[19289.98s -> 19295.98s]  various theories circulated after her fate some believe she boarded an interstellar ship
[19295.98s -> 19302.22s]  capable of journeying to a distant colony others believe she died trying to escape tartarus
[19303.42s -> 19308.94s]  some few suggest she fled to monarch where she continued to live among a small band of loyalists
[19308.94s -> 19313.66s]  and then there's me there is another fear the narrator of this story that sophia's encounter
[19314.06s -> 19318.86s]  and here's uh it's me talking deliberately retreated from public view but continued
[19318.86s -> 19324.94s]  supporting the colony in secret when dr wells began reviving the hopes colonists he found
[19324.94s -> 19330.70s]  himself with a sudden windfall of additional supplies and resources courtesy of an anonymous
[19330.70s -> 19340.65s]  donor if world knew who it's bugleberry never chairman rockwell also for the changes in house
[19340.97s -> 19347.69s]  to come whenever you needed strings pulled or a voice to sell a policy change rockwell was only
[19347.69s -> 19353.45s]  too happy to oblige they should have killed him as for dr phineas wells he spent his remaining
[19353.45s -> 19361.00s]  years in his orbital lab he did by the failures of his past um he was determined to make things
[19361.00s -> 19367.00s]  right by building toward what happens if you kill everybody do you even get an end of the game
[19367.72s -> 19372.92s]  engineers than he first expected thanks to the additional batch of chemicals you stole from the
[19372.92s -> 19379.00s]  ministry wells never forgot about the human lives that were lost in acquiring these chemicals does
[19379.00s -> 19387.64s]  it just get to the end here it just goes the end despite limited resources over half the hopes
[19387.64s -> 19394.12s]  colonists were successfully revived even after wells passed away the hopes scientists and
[19394.12s -> 19401.24s]  engineers worked night and day to pull halcyon from the brink of collapse their efforts continued
[19401.24s -> 19407.75s]  to this day which may be reason enough for optimism dr wells laid the groundwork for
[19407.75s -> 19412.31s]  the project to save the colony but he would never live to see the fruits of his labor
[19413.11s -> 19419.03s]  he passed away a few years later his work was carried on by the scientists and engineers he
[19419.03s -> 19425.75s]  revived life will never be the same in halcyon it is widely agreed that the colony has a chance
[19425.75s -> 19431.35s]  of stabilizing within a generation owing to the hard work and determination of the surviving
[19431.35s -> 19439.82s]  colonists recovery is a distant goal and the path is long and uncertain but the people of halcyon
[19439.82s -> 19447.74s]  carry on determined as ever and what about you the unplanned variable in the history of what happened
[19447.74s -> 19454.94s]  to me you brought an end to the chaos on trotter and left dr wells to save halcyon on his own
[19455.75s -> 19462.90s]  you had more pressing matters to attend to as you tasted your first scoop of risos partially
[19462.90s -> 19471.46s]  emulsified semi-frozen milk like dessert you realized something all your troubles all your
[19471.46s -> 19480.84s]  adventures all your struggles and choices they had all led to this single moment and it was all
[19480.84s -> 19486.62s]  worth it there's a nice touch i like that what happened to earth and no one knows what the
[19486.62s -> 19494.30s]  future has in store for halcyon all we know for certain is this the name of the unreliable and
[19494.30s -> 19500.70s]  that of its intrepid captain will remain the subject of countless stories for years to come
[19504.78s -> 19517.99s]  no now it's the end that moral of story oh why be violent when you just lie
[19519.27s -> 19543.32s]  and make everybody believe things that aren't true and save the world ice cream game give final
[19543.32s -> 19555.45s]  score now um i feel like all right the game was fun i thought it was an interesting game i thought
[19555.45s -> 19567.38s]  it was a fun game i do i think it was good but the that main campaign how many main story missions
[19567.38s -> 19580.30s]  even were there like eight i don't they weren't more than like seven or eight main story missions
[19580.30s -> 19595.27s]  in the game maybe ten five and the fact that the the the main sort of antagonist of the entire
[19595.27s -> 19601.24s]  video game they just sort of appear and almost like pretend like you should know who they are
[19601.96s -> 19614.47s]  one of which you only get to see on screen twice you could have gone on a date with pivardi
[19614.47s -> 19633.32s]  oh that's too bad there's a 12 minute speed run if you go evil and corporate you meet them earlier
[19633.32s -> 19643.40s]  wasn't i corporate i wasn't i doing stuff for corporate including the optional quest he didn't
[19643.40s -> 19654.18s]  really miss much 10 to everybody msi is not part of the board all right all right i'm sure there's
[19654.18s -> 19662.33s]  plenty of stuff that i didn't do i did two runs of the game and it's barely a difference and there's
[19662.33s -> 19674.49s]  like three board quests but even still though i feel like them if you if you just oh i'm gonna
[19674.49s -> 19680.62s]  do the main i didn't i didn't i felt like i dilly dally a lot was this three i was streaming two
[19680.62s -> 19690.89s]  hours before the internet went down so let's say let's say just under six hours today and then
[19690.89s -> 19698.95s]  seven six or seven hours yesterday and then four so like 16 17 hours in the game 15 hours in game
[19703.99s -> 19708.63s]  now i guess that's still that's still pretty good if for but i still i feel like i did other stuff
[19708.63s -> 19722.01s]  too i wasn't just doing story missions 15 to 25 is the average yeah took me about 30 hours to do
[19722.01s -> 19741.48s]  everything okay i did skip an optional planet yeah that's probably true but it's hard to place it
[19741.48s -> 19763.66s]  it was it was like a it was like a seven three seven two something like that it got maybe point
[19763.66s -> 19775.69s]  two point three base points there because the ice cream ending it was good i i look i wouldn't have
[19775.69s -> 19784.34s]  played it and stream the whole thing if i didn't think it was any fun maybe like a c like a seven
[19784.34s -> 19796.71s]  seven one there you go i wasn't a fan of the ending but i was a liar so like i like lied
[19796.71s -> 19804.62s]  to myself about of you know in the first place i said the same thing yesterday too it's it was
[19804.62s -> 19808.54s]  i had an enjoyable experience in the video game and not every video game has to be the best game
[19808.54s -> 19823.78s]  you ever played so there's that too i lie to myself every day would it have been as funny if
[19823.78s -> 19833.05s]  you didn't go down the liar route maybe not but you know how i mean everybody that plays this game
[19833.05s -> 19845.88s]  is gonna play it a little differently new vegas now or whoa i've ruined new vegas for myself i
[19845.88s -> 19852.18s]  can't play it i was being chased by like a hundred easy peets i would i had the time gun
[19853.22s -> 19867.16s]  i can't play new vegas again i can't do it i stepped way out of i i like pulled myself out
[19867.16s -> 19880.73s]  of the universe and just made it a shit show but new vegas is overrated i didn't i didn't say that
[19880.73s -> 19886.09s]  i thought it was good for the two about full streams i played it until i cheated this is where
[19886.09s -> 19891.64s]  it went very very very wrong there was a point in new vegas when i couldn't open the door i
[19891.64s -> 19897.96s]  remember explicitly where it was it was in that bar with the um there was a show going on behind
[19897.96s -> 19901.32s]  the door and i didn't feel like going to get the key so i just no clip through the door
[19902.73s -> 19906.49s]  and that was it it was over over at that point because i and then now you've ruined everything
[19906.49s -> 19923.10s]  and you can do that everywhere and then i but it don't matter anyways thank you for watching
[19923.74s -> 19928.22s]  that's going to be the end of the stream well i know it looks like it's been a three and a
[19928.22s -> 19933.98s]  half hour stream but it's actually been about six because of uh the internet crashing halfway through
[19934.70s -> 19941.64s]  but thanks for watching i'll see you guys in like three or four days probably on
[19944.14s -> 19950.55s]  either monday or tuesday and we're probably going to just start halo because that's when it comes
[19950.55s -> 19956.94s]  out right i have those of you that don't know i have a procedure coming up here i have to do
[19956.94s -> 19961.02s]  another endoscopy and it's gonna put me on drugs it's gonna fuck me up for a day or two and i have
[19961.02s -> 19964.14s]  to fast the night before so there's gonna be like two or three days when i'm just gonna kind of be
[19964.14s -> 19975.75s]  out of it so i have to do that hope you had a happy thanksgiving everybody that celebrates it
[19975.75s -> 19983.48s]  i will see you guys at the latest probably tuesday either monday or tuesday is when you'll
[19983.48s -> 19991.88s]  probably see me depends on how i feel after everything's done he's kind of being drugged
[19995.19s -> 20002.36s]  see you soon we'll do the bits we'll hang out for a little bit and sorry about the whole thing
[20002.36s -> 20008.70s]  crashing earlier it was very strange it's like the internet went down but it didn't it was very
[20008.70s -> 20036.63s]  weird but yeah see you soon let's transition over here maybe it was a twitch ingest problem
[20036.63s -> 20049.45s]  maybe that's very possible this is still broken it always is yeah it don't matter it seems to reset
[20049.45s -> 20056.10s]  itself after about two or three weeks it then decides to pull from a stream from two weeks ago
[20058.54s -> 20064.31s]  don't ask me why hey shitty viewbot thanks for the 500 bits i was just wondering if you
[20064.31s -> 20069.75s]  ever played any of the serious sam games you seem to have a lot of fun with dusk and the two games
[20069.75s -> 20080.14s]  seem quite similar i had a vision a few years ago where there's a weird dream that i had when
[20080.14s -> 20087.85s]  me and star played it the whole thing so i made a video on it i've had this strange dream about it
[20092.22s -> 20098.07s]  something about that we were getting chased by crabs and stuff it was really really it was
[20098.07s -> 20110.97s]  fun though i remember playing the whole thing was fun but um yeah i thought about it serious sam is
[20110.97s -> 20117.30s]  interesting serious sam is a game that i always have glossed over i don't know why just because
[20117.30s -> 20127.42s]  it seems too chaotic but it's not like i'm against ever playing it 20 to 30 uploads in the future
[20136.47s -> 20145.85s]  uh it has come across my desk a few times and i just go maybe uh thank you dark soul for the 250

[20338.06s -> 20341.90s]  the 400 bits hey germa i may not be here when the stream ends but i want to thank you and chat for

[20365.58s -> 20374.04s]  best and again i will say do not be afraid of going to therapy do not be afraid of somebody

[20389.05s -> 20393.21s]  thanks for the 250 happy thanksgiving germa turkey i'm extremely thankful for all the
[20393.21s -> 20398.25s]  outstanding content you've consistently put out over the years as your career as an internet
[20398.25s -> 20409.08s]  comedian superstar and millionaire thank you appreciate that thanks for the 250 bits uh sign
[20409.08s -> 20415.42s]  up with facebook thanks for the 250 uh hey germa why is it that you don't that you have donations
[20415.42s -> 20420.22s]  disabled and only bits turned on you'll get the full money from cash donations unlike bits where
[20420.22s -> 20426.38s]  it splits with twitch i'm sure some people would prefer to donate cash also like that you'd be one
[20426.38s -> 20433.61s]  step closer to becoming bill germates a long time ago i decided against having something like a
[20433.61s -> 20441.21s]  paypal setup because paypal is sort of weird and they will i remember hearing horror stories of
[20441.21s -> 20448.46s]  people sending a bunch of money and then they can charge it back and if you've already transferred
[20448.46s -> 20453.34s]  that money or accepted it or spent it or something then it's like wait you have to give that money
[20453.34s -> 20458.70s]  back and it's like wait what and it goes into like an appeal process i don't know people that still
[20458.70s -> 20464.94s]  do it and well just don't touch the money for 90 days and it's like well okay well just let it sit
[20464.94s -> 20470.62s]  should just have like an a big open pit of a paypal account where i just don't touch it ever and then
[20470.62s -> 20477.56s]  i look at it every like four months to see what's in there so it's just something if i was ever
[20477.56s -> 20489.78s]  going to do anything like that i don't i just don't think i would just it's it's kind of too
[20489.78s -> 20504.98s]  much for me to have to think about spoken like a true crypto backer you just said a contradiction
[20504.98s -> 20513.66s]  what was it what did i not convey the thought did i go off what did i do i said i've charged back
[20513.66s -> 20518.54s]  and people sending money and then like four months later they can take it back it's interesting stuff
[20519.50s -> 20525.10s]  right that's why that's why i don't do it if i ever did that i wouldn't oh right but
[20526.30s -> 20530.22s]  that's me mid-thought changing gears and saying i'm not gonna do it
[20530.22s -> 20543.11s]  there was talk a long time ago of a patreon but a patreon is just subs but on a different website
[20544.71s -> 20551.69s]  you know hey sign up for my patreon hey you you subscribe but there's a different website where
[20551.69s -> 20558.41s]  you can subscribe again it just didn't feel right it felt sort of like didn't feel didn't click
[20559.05s -> 20570.44s]  but you'll get more money yeah but i would rather take a sponsorship or something than
[20570.44s -> 20577.53s]  try to double dip you guys you know what i mean like hey give me five dollars a month on twitch
[20577.53s -> 20581.29s]  all right cool thanks a lot hey you know i got a patreon five dollars a month over there too
[20583.16s -> 20593.27s]  like but you all right i guess but you already you already are doing that just make it as a
[20593.27s -> 20603.67s]  tip jar maybe i just have no goals or reward tiers or anything i guess maybe it would just be there
[20608.47s -> 20615.11s]  it's are a tip jar yeah i know but i'm just saying having bits and subs and then having a patreon is
[20615.11s -> 20620.90s]  like you're asking the same people that are potentially giving money already to do it again
[20623.77s -> 20631.05s]  which i would rather instead of tapping into you guys again for a separate website to pay money
[20631.85s -> 20649.10s]  to i would rather just i would do a sponsorship before that he hates taking our money pepe hands
[20652.66s -> 20664.18s]  you need at least 10 different sources of revenue no i don't need 10 sources of revenue
[20668.31s -> 20681.16s]  but yeah i guess that's a long answer to why i don't have a donation set up i don't know that's
[20681.16s -> 20685.96s]  kind of the thought process but thank you for the 250 sign up with facebook i appreciate it
[20688.04s -> 20695.24s]  c4g thanks for the 250 rpg ayaya clap cute chat rise up rpg ayaya clap

[20720.87s -> 20730.22s]  bits uh i'm glad that's not possible because not only that would be uh that would be a little
[20730.22s -> 20733.50s]  strange but also that would mean that people could reach through and strangle me
[20734.38s -> 20751.05s]  so i'm i'm glad that's not a capable technology at the moment thanks for the 500 bits let's get

[20894.30s -> 20899.90s]  here before the character limit mostly because of my four years of watching new sub badges when

[20963.21s -> 20977.59s]  i modded you in spirit in my mind guys all it takes is to slash mod and then all the sudden
[20977.59s -> 20981.35s]  that person just has to like copy and paste a bunch of commands they might have saved
[20981.35s -> 20990.47s]  and delete everything i've ever worked on they could like delete every nightbot command they
[20990.47s -> 20998.38s]  get to lead every vod i don't know i'm scared i almost had so much power you did for a few

[21161.40s -> 21169.37s]  i was active on youtube was four plus five maybe years ago so the advice that i would give somebody
[21169.37s -> 21176.50s]  is like five year old advice it's like watching uh patch notes from a game that you currently play
[21177.46s -> 21186.30s]  when the game was in beta three years ago so i feel like some of the stuff i would say might
[21186.30s -> 21203.94s]  not be accurate anymore but uh listen to my music here was here you go if you want to listen to
