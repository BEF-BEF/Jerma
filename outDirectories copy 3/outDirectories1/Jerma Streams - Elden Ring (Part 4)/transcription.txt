[6.52s -> 20.73s]  Hi. Hey, hi. Hey, hey, hi. What's up? Welcome back to another edition of Elden Ring.
[24.95s -> 32.42s]  I'm late, yes. By a lot. Uh, I just, here's the thing. I'll tell you a secret. If you want to
[32.42s -> 38.66s]  hear a stream, a streamer's secret, this is a secret we all have. So I'm really kind of blowing up
[38.66s -> 42.34s]  every streamer here when it comes to like blowing up there. Like, don't, don't say that we talk
[42.34s -> 48.82s]  mode. What are you talking about? So I'm kind of going to pull the rug out here. Streamers don't
[48.82s -> 62.17s]  shit all day. Make sure everyone knows that. Some of them do. But for the most part, streamers
[63.69s -> 71.10s]  pee. Oh, if you're a streamer, you got to make sure that you're empty before you turn the stream
[71.10s -> 85.26s]  on. I don't think it really do explain why. Now, some people have this magic power where they can
[85.26s -> 90.70s]  just go to the bathroom and just, just go and be done in three minutes. I don't know how that's
[90.70s -> 102.30s]  possible. It takes me at minimum. Okay. I get in there a couple of minutes. Sit down, relax.
[103.02s -> 108.41s]  What about the phone? All right. What's my entertainment going to be for the next maybe
[108.41s -> 115.37s]  five to 10 minutes? All right. I'm not ready yet. It's not there yet. You do it. You spit.
[115.45s -> 120.09s]  You sit there for a little while. You have to clean up, right? Like it takes a long time.
[125.58s -> 137.85s]  It takes at least 10 to 20 minutes for me to go number two. Always. I hope you have more than one
[137.85s -> 146.30s]  bathroom. I mean, I also have digestive problems too. And there he is. He just got you. And that's
[146.30s -> 156.78s]  how you know that now, now you've got to apologize to me. I'm telling you right now. All right. Those
[156.78s -> 162.81s]  of you that think that I want you to do me a favor the next time that you are going to go number two
[162.81s -> 166.41s]  and you're going to get surprised by this because people feel the same way. When you take a shower,
[166.41s -> 170.73s]  people think the same thing. Oh man, I take like five minute showers. What are you talking about?
[170.73s -> 174.89s]  No, dude, you're in there for 10 to 15 minutes. You just don't, your brain is not processing it
[174.89s -> 178.97s]  because you're like alone in a fucking cube and you're just like in your own head for fucking 10
[178.97s -> 186.47s]  minutes. When you go to the, when you take a number two next time, before you open the door
[186.47s -> 192.31s]  to the bathroom, start a timer and then put it, put it away. Don't even look at it. Do what you
[192.31s -> 195.75s]  normally would do. And then I want, when you come out, I want you to look at it.
[196.47s -> 200.15s]  And I wanted, I, I'm, I just, you're going to see it and you're going to go, all right, it's been,
[200.15s -> 203.99s]  all right, all right, all right, all right. It's been like 12 minutes. It's been like 15 minutes.
[203.99s -> 212.78s]  Okay. And then you're not, you got to come into the chat and you're not going to say anything.
[212.78s -> 215.26s]  You'd be like, Oh, hey man, what's the stream today? What do you, what do you stream today?
[215.82s -> 223.51s]  Elden Ring? Oh, nice man. The thing is you actually should probably, here's the thing about
[223.51s -> 228.50s]  showers. Timing your shower is really not a bad idea because you really can get just lost in your
[228.50s -> 231.94s]  head while you're sitting there, just scrubbing the same parts of your body. You've scrubbed like
[231.94s -> 237.18s]  10 times already. I think like having like a five to 10 minute timer in the shower is good. It's a
[237.18s -> 244.87s]  good kind of like, all right, get the fuck out of there. Better for like, you know, water and stuff.
[244.87s -> 249.27s]  You don't want to waste too much water, but also just for the, for your routine for the day too.
[250.15s -> 259.18s]  You'd be surprised how long you're actually in there for. Yeah. And you got to dry too.
[259.18s -> 264.46s]  People think that the whole routine in the bathroom is five, 10 minutes. No, you got to dry,
[264.46s -> 267.18s]  you've got to comb your hair. You've got to do your skincare routine,
[267.90s -> 273.42s]  moisturizing, tooth brushing. It's like 40 minutes to an hour to do a morning routine.
[275.48s -> 280.92s]  Dude, I, dude, if I was like president of the world, I would sign like a presidential world
[280.92s -> 288.68s]  executive order that no, nothing was allowed to begin. Nothing. Didn't matter what it was before
[288.68s -> 293.96s]  9 a.m. Before 10 a.m. Like everything had to start at at least 9 a.m. At least,
[296.15s -> 302.31s]  but that would kind of fuck up everything because there's like this stuff that like requires like
[302.31s -> 305.99s]  really early morning stuff. Like, okay, that would fuck up the entire world. Never mind.
[309.06s -> 313.70s]  You wouldn't know. No ambulances. No, no, no, no. It would be like specific industries.
[313.70s -> 318.50s]  All right. What I just said was really stupid. Okay. That was stupid because if you make everything
[318.50s -> 324.58s]  have to start at 9 a.m., then what happens if something happens at 8 a.m.? What if there's like
[324.58s -> 327.78s]  logistics that have to happen at like four, five, six o'clock in the morning somewhere?
[328.34s -> 345.82s]  Speak for yourself. I'm a morning person. You are onto something there. What about time zones?
[347.85s -> 356.92s]  Nothing as president of the entire universe. Nothing is allowed to begin before I get up.
[358.04s -> 370.04s]  9 a.m. Pacific time. When I get up, that's when the world starts and we play the world.
[371.08s -> 378.18s]  We play the world anthem for me. My favorite song. Learn to fly by the Foo Fighters.
[379.06s -> 387.48s]  Everybody has to listen to it. All right. Let's go. We're going to Elden Ring again.
[390.28s -> 396.12s]  9 p.m. Start. You understand my point, though. It takes a lot longer than you think it does to
[396.12s -> 401.08s]  do a morning routine. And yeah, it's the afternoon. I know this wasn't a morning routine. I had other
[401.08s -> 406.90s]  things I had to take care of in the morning. I got up at 9 a.m. Of course I did. I got up at 9 a.m.
[406.90s -> 416.58s]  I did my taxes. I ran two miles. I ate a full breakfast with pretty much all vitamins covered.
[418.12s -> 423.66s]  I consulted for a few companies. I consulted for some people. Made a few bucks, you know,
[423.66s -> 429.34s]  consulting. And then I got in the shower. Then I took a shit. It took 45 minutes. Okay. So it
[429.34s -> 433.18s]  takes me an hour to get my routine done of my cleansing routine. That's what I'm going to call
[433.18s -> 447.38s]  it. Hi. Dude, some people are just different. Yeah, I agree. Some people are just built differently,
[447.38s -> 455.54s]  aren't they? I'm going to tell you, every single one of these Elden Ring streams is going to start
[455.54s -> 464.25s]  weird. This is the way it is. Every single Elden Ring stream is going to be a weird stream
[464.89s -> 469.91s]  because it's equal parts me excited, equal parts me annoyed of me not being able to beat that last
[469.91s -> 476.07s]  boss, and equal parts me being happy that it's a thing that I'm happy playing. I don't think it's
[476.07s -> 478.95s]  ever happened before. I would like somebody to figure this out. Someone that's been in the
[478.95s -> 485.62s]  community for a long time. I don't think there's ever been a... I don't... I might break a personal
[485.62s -> 494.26s]  channel record here of games streamed in a row, time streamed in a row. I think we're about to
[494.26s -> 511.35s]  break a channel record here. It's on the shirt. Dr. Pepper. 40 hour in a row. It would probably
[511.35s -> 517.78s]  be a little bit more than that after today. Dorsary was pretty long. I don't know if it was
[518.42s -> 523.78s]  10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours. Especially if I decide if I don't decide to take
[523.78s -> 529.26s]  tomorrow off. You're talking about probably 50 to 60 hours in a row, which I've never ever done
[530.94s -> 538.92s]  ever since YouTube even like 10, 12 fucking years ago. All right, so last thing we did,
[538.92s -> 543.16s]  I beat that boss in the academy. I got some cool stuff. We have leveled up a few times.
[543.96s -> 551.32s]  The Jedi game was long, but now I'm talking in a row, right? Like I'm talking in, you know, like
[552.50s -> 556.02s]  Monday 10 hours, Tuesday 10 hours, Wednesday 10 hours, Thursday 10 hours. Like I don't think
[556.02s -> 565.61s]  I've ever done it. You already decided to take tomorrow off. Yes, and what... but here's the thing.
[566.41s -> 573.74s]  Tomorrow is very relative. Tomorrow is incredibly relative term because it's 5 p.m. Pacific right
[573.74s -> 584.42s]  now, and I'm about to start playing Elden Ring. I might be streaming into tomorrow, if you know,
[584.42s -> 590.01s]  if you understand what I'm saying here. Like if this is another 10 to 12 hour stream or something,
[590.01s -> 596.71s]  I actually, I might be streaming like into tomorrow morning. So that's what I mean when I say take
[596.71s -> 605.78s]  tomorrow off. The ominous music in the background. It's all relative. We'll see. Look, I'm fine. I'm
[605.78s -> 614.66s]  fine. I've got matcha powder, which is a fucking superpower. I wish I was fucking around. I like
[614.66s -> 621.85s]  really do. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. I've been drinking like matcha just like you have like
[621.85s -> 629.67s]  a matcha tea. Like when we start some like vitamins and stuff, I feel like fucking fantastic.
[630.39s -> 638.71s]  This has been a long time since I felt like this after streaming. What about your kidneys?
[639.27s -> 652.58s]  It's green tea. It's green tea. Is it? There's an item here. Wait, why is there? Didn't I pick this
[652.58s -> 676.34s]  up? Okay. So I didn't pick this up somehow. Oh, cool. Why do I have to look? I just look like,
[676.34s -> 685.13s]  I look like, okay, I look like the witch from Snow White. Um, that's not going on,
[685.69s -> 696.63s]  although it looks kind of cool. Increases your health though. That's not bad. That's cool,
[696.63s -> 703.27s]  but not, not great. It's Captain Hook. We gotta, we have to stay with the Burger King because it
[703.27s -> 710.89s]  has the intelligence is just where it's at for me. The big bad wolf. That's what I was thinking
[710.89s -> 717.02s]  of not. Well, it could be go either way. I'm thinking of all the characters I've seen in
[717.02s -> 721.74s]  like Disney movies that like their nose goes like this and their chin goes like this almost
[721.74s -> 741.75s]  meeting in the middle. Okay. So let's go here. Goofy. All the witches in Disney are like,
[743.35s -> 747.51s]  they're like, oh, yes, my pretty. They have like, they have, they have beaks.
[748.15s -> 761.13s]  All right. Where are we going? Uh, this is where I was last time.
[761.13s -> 774.76s]  Doofenshmirtz. Doofenshmirtz. Doofenshmirtz. Yes, exactly. Oh, yes. Oh, well, there is the
[774.76s -> 792.79s]  platypus, my pretty. Right? Like, what was that? What is this thing? All right. Headphones going
[792.79s -> 797.03s]  in for this. I feel like this is going to be, what is, this is like a, oh, oh, look at the
[797.03s -> 829.75s]  beak on this one. You got a lot of health. Can I get behind you? Yeah. Oof. That didn't really do
[829.75s -> 840.49s]  much. And that was a bad time to wind up like that. Are you susceptible to magic? Oh, that's a long
[840.49s -> 870.71s]  call. Dude, settle down. Wrong button. 155. Oh, that's a stagger. That thing, if you hit it twice
[870.71s -> 890.74s]  in a row. What? Land octopus ovary. Oh, okay. So this, I hit that twice and he, boom, got staggered.
[891.38s -> 898.44s]  That's a really crazy enemy. This is, this reminds me of Bloodborne. This is like a Bloodborne enemy.
[901.51s -> 907.69s]  Okay. So the last, we can take this off because I already have the key. The dragon's still there.
[908.41s -> 921.46s]  Now here's the question. How come he can't do 3k damage every fight? Because that was, that enemy
[921.46s -> 932.95s]  was susceptible. Oh, give the key to that guy. Right. Where was that? Dummy. Over here, right?
[932.95s -> 946.42s]  Hopefully this isn't going to mess me up, but I'm going to give it to him. Are you still chasing me?
[951.37s -> 961.94s]  Didn't he say, oh, if you end up finding a second key, bring it to me. Right. What does it say?
[962.58s -> 972.20s]  Key to the seals, binding both gates of the Academy of Raelucaria. Glenstone Key will remember its
[972.20s -> 978.04s]  user, meaning once used, it can never be passed on to another. The Academy does not welcome the
[978.04s -> 988.65s]  indolent. Okay. I can't even give it to him. I can't, I can't give it to him. Well, I have
[988.65s -> 996.52s]  to find another one. Sad. Oh, so we're not going to do that. Here's, I think I want to go this way.
[997.62s -> 1003.74s]  We've gone way, way far up here on the, uh, the Western kind of like Northwestern side
[1004.54s -> 1008.34s]  because I wanted to do the Academy to get the spells, which I did, which is cool.
[1009.14s -> 1020.97s]  But now I think I want to go over here like this way because it's time to start like trekking this
[1020.97s -> 1024.97s]  way. And I probably can't, I got here way too early, but once I go through this section, maybe
[1025.61s -> 1034.31s]  I'll be leveled enough to do this section. I think that's the play. That's where I'm going to go.
[1034.31s -> 1036.81s]  So we're going to go down here. We're going to take this road here. We're going to start
[1036.81s -> 1043.80s]  exploring this area here. And if anybody has a problem with that, then you can just leave.
[1043.80s -> 1060.33s]  Well, we'll go here. Would you say that souls games are grindy? Well, it depends on how easy
[1060.33s -> 1066.46s]  you want to make the game. Difficulty slider for souls games is how long you are willing to
[1067.18s -> 1069.58s]  grind souls to make your character stronger, to fight whatever you want.
[1070.66s -> 1077.50s]  So you, if you can really, really hunker down and really just desperately try to learn each
[1077.50s -> 1084.49s]  encounter of bosses in major places, then yeah, I mean, you could say you have to kind of grind a
[1084.49s -> 1090.01s]  little. I don't think that much though, to get to a point where you're capable of fighting something.
[1091.38s -> 1101.77s]  But I think that grinding souls is just your way to make the game a little easier for you.
[1102.86s -> 1108.92s]  And there's nothing wrong with that. There really isn't. Don't let anybody tell you that,
[1110.12s -> 1114.76s]  oh, you, you, you leveled up like three or four more times and like you went to fight the first
[1114.76s -> 1123.72s]  boss. Casual. You have to be, you have to be clear. Not everybody wants to play the naked
[1123.72s -> 1132.86s]  guy with the club with zero stats. And the fact that some people do is like, holy shit,
[1136.74s -> 1141.14s]  you're like really, really fucking incredibly talented and you have like an insane reaction time
[1143.18s -> 1146.62s]  and you're able to give yourself like an absurd challenge, right? Like a really, really big
[1146.62s -> 1151.98s]  challenge. And that that's commendable. It is, that's awesome. But like people are just going
[1151.98s -> 1161.72s]  to play the game differently, right? Like it's, I mean, okay. If I were to level up like 50 times
[1161.72s -> 1167.64s]  before going to the first boss, then it's like, uh, you're going to kill them in like 10 swings.
[1168.90s -> 1172.02s]  At that point, it's like, all right, well, I mean, you kind of might be missing out on some
[1172.02s -> 1179.59s]  of the fun of the game at that point. Like, yeah, I just went into the, uh, I went into the first
[1179.59s -> 1186.07s]  boss area, um, level 80 and, uh, I can kill, um, I can kill Margaret and force swing.
[1187.19s -> 1191.35s]  That's like, yeah, that, that kind of maybe goes against like the, oh, these guys get off
[1192.23s -> 1211.53s]  cool and calculated fall joke, man. Yeah. Stop monologuing at us. The point is don't be ashamed
[1211.53s -> 1217.77s]  if you got to level up five, six more times before going to a boss. It's not a contest.
[1218.65s -> 1231.46s]  Well, the reason why that's encouraged in this game is because unlike other souls games,
[1232.50s -> 1237.91s]  doing that is not discouraged because there's so much shit to do in the main world. That's
[1237.91s -> 1244.71s]  not just linearly go to each boss. There's so many things to see that like going and like leveling
[1244.71s -> 1248.23s]  and grinding and other places and like finding new things to play and new bosses, little mini
[1248.23s -> 1262.09s]  games and stuff. Oh, do it. No, don't how it makes me want to. So I got to, what's the deal with these
[1262.09s -> 1276.04s]  guys that just, they just light up, but these guys turn red. You get to kind of get to figure
[1276.04s -> 1312.62s]  out what that means. The music has changed though. Why is the music changed? It's like,
[1316.06s -> 1325.99s]  have I been here before? I haven't been this way. I haven't been down. I've been here, but I don't,
[1325.99s -> 1337.67s]  let me just look down here and see if there's anything there. Yeah, this stuff, I didn't go
[1337.67s -> 1352.02s]  down this little river. I also like how everywhere those things are. Why is the horse not allowed
[1352.02s -> 1357.99s]  here? Did I just get game mechanics spoiled of an encounter that's about to happen?
[1358.71s -> 1379.19s]  I got game mechanics spoiled. Bloody finger nary just what? How did that not hit him?
[1379.19s -> 1392.66s]  Dude, how can you faster than I am? Somebody bloody finger hunter is summoned. I got a buddy.
[1394.28s -> 1408.07s]  Help me kill him. Get him. Get him. Nice parry. Who is this? Oh, I got to make sure he doesn't die.
[1408.87s -> 1438.42s]  Yeah, fuck you invader. You're not even hurting him. Those dodges. Oh my God. I could feel that
[1438.42s -> 1452.25s]  guy's sweat dripping from his head from here. Oh, you're out of estus. Protect the caster,
[1452.25s -> 1472.50s]  protect the healer. Got him. So what was that all about? Reduvia with his accomplished goal,
[1472.50s -> 1490.10s]  bloody finger hunter Yura returned to his world. What was that? Is that a key item?
[1491.30s -> 1511.37s]  What was that thing called? No, where is it? What the hell was that thing just called?
[1512.41s -> 1531.74s]  Arcane. This thing scales with arcane. This dagger rips the flesh as it enters, inflicting blood loss
[1531.74s -> 1543.24s]  with it. Yeah. Reduvia blood blade, slash with the wicked dagger, transforming its never drying
[1543.24s -> 1549.99s]  blood stains into airborne blood blades. I want to see what it looks like. That's pretty sick
[1549.99s -> 1557.24s]  looking though. There's a dagger and it scales with dex and arcane. That's really cool looking.
[1558.20s -> 1573.93s]  Let me see what the combat art is. What? Okay. This is awesome. I'm assuming that's the part
[1573.93s -> 1587.80s]  that scales with arcane. This does bleed. It's got, that's a dagger with ranged. That's pretty
[1587.80s -> 1598.10s]  amazing. All right. Well, that was a cool encounter. Why am I still red? I just am. I got a lot of blood
[1598.10s -> 1603.22s]  in my face. There's blood all over my body. It's everywhere inside of me. Sometimes it goes up here.
[1603.78s -> 1617.83s]  Let's keep going. Any other weird shit that I didn't see? What was the, where was the encounter?
[1617.83s -> 1623.43s]  Where was that? Uh, that, that triggered when I went through. So here, I'll show you.
[1624.23s -> 1636.07s]  I walked through this kind of tunnel river area down here. So here from this, from the
[1636.07s -> 1644.42s]  Mirkwater Coast bonfire, I went through here to the river and that started here. And I don't know
[1644.42s -> 1647.70s]  if it's guaranteed drop from that guy. It might be, maybe it's not. A lot of stuff in these games
[1647.70s -> 1657.16s]  is not. It took a 40 minute long shit. I didn't take a 40 minute long shit. I'm just saying my
[1657.16s -> 1675.91s]  routine to get cleaned up is like an hour. This is a dungeon. Mirkwater cave. We see like, okay,
[1675.91s -> 1681.46s]  if you're getting your ass kicked by a boss and you just can't do it, it's so hard to pull it
[1681.46s -> 1688.49s]  because you want to get it done, right? It's the hardest thing to stop. Get out of there and like,
[1688.49s -> 1693.93s]  come down here. There's like so much more to the game than fighting the three phased boss
[1693.93s -> 1714.18s]  encounter with 500 million HP. I think I want to, no, this is good for now. Maybe I should put on
[1714.18s -> 1750.90s]  the starlight. What's that guy doing? What a weird patrol. I got to get my steps in. I can,
[1750.90s -> 1770.73s]  I can make sure that I could post about it. It didn't hit everybody. It should have. What the fuck
[1770.73s -> 1780.74s]  are you throwing at me? I thought this is where this thing is going to shine, man. And I have to
[1780.74s -> 1808.02s]  get it. See? All right. That was weird. What is ringing that bell? I get, I need starlight.
[1808.02s -> 1812.26s]  I can't see shit. I want starlight. I don't care if these guys respawn.
[1814.18s -> 1832.55s]  Cave moss? Mushroom. Five mushrooms. That was in the chest. Who puts five mushrooms in a treasure
[1832.55s -> 1851.98s]  chest? That seems like what a waste of a chest. It's this shit. These bells. I need starlight.
[1854.26s -> 1878.87s]  I'm running into bells, I think. Give me starlight. Um, where the fuck did I come from?
[1878.87s -> 1898.65s]  Where did I come from? Where's my bonfire? Where am I? Over here? Oh, okay. I can't see shit.
[1899.45s -> 1913.32s]  Oh, it is just a boss. All right. Well, nevermind. No object permanence. I couldn't see. Look, it's
[1915.02s -> 1925.62s]  okay. Can you see in there? Fine. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[1925.62s -> 1956.87s]  What is in this room? We'll find out very shortly. Something's gonna crash through that.
[1957.75s -> 1970.68s]  Something's running around up there. It's giving me a little alien thing.
[1970.68s -> 2047.83s]  Patches? Of course Patches is in this game. Patches. Yeah! Wait, please. Really? Okay.
[2048.63s -> 2055.16s]  So, Patches is in the game. I just had to turn the volume up a little bit and I'm terrified
[2055.16s -> 2059.80s]  that I'm gonna accidentally like back into the window of the game. Yep. Okay.
[2084.54s -> 2089.72s]  I don't know. He's gonna do it again, right? He's absolutely gonna do it again.
[2097.90s -> 2102.06s]  Okay, so if some things can't be forgiven and we backstab him and kill him, we'll get something
[2102.06s -> 2108.79s]  that he has on him. Whatever it is. Or give and forget means he becomes a vendor, which he might
[2108.79s -> 2117.66s]  sell something useful and he also might show up later in the game. I'm curious.
[2117.90s -> 2130.34s]  Just what I'm tethered, like you, only free-spirited. Nothing, you might say. Only for now,
[2130.34s -> 2136.90s]  those retired soldiers turned bandits. Ah, they're paying for my gruel in exchange for my, well,
[2137.62s -> 2143.30s]  showing them the ropes. Showing them the ropes. Honestly, this looting racket is bloody terrifying.
[2144.02s -> 2151.05s]  Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop. So don't be a stranger.
[2151.77s -> 2162.74s]  Really? Yes! Somebody did it! Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.
[2162.74s -> 2169.54s]  We're ready to wheel and deal. Come next time. Oh. Okay, so I gotta come back here and there'll be a,
[2169.54s -> 2178.55s]  he'll have a shop here? All right, we gotta reload the area because I got, I mean, what do you got?
[2179.35s -> 2186.52s]  You're where Patches is a reoccurring character. Oh yeah. He's always a dick. He always like,
[2186.60s -> 2192.60s]  fucks with you. Um, he's always like a weird friend slash foe that always is an asshole.
[2193.16s -> 2197.16s]  But he does, sometimes he can be kind of useful. If sometimes he can be kind of useful.
[2200.01s -> 2208.47s]  Let's come right back. Just kill him. He's going to backstab you in the next Souls game.
[2209.03s -> 2217.69s]  Okay, so can I go back down here now? Do I have to pass time or will he just be like,
[2217.69s -> 2225.56s]  can he just, can I just do it? What was with the bells? That was weird. Why, what, what,
[2226.04s -> 2257.16s]  what the bells? Why all the bells? Just, it's just like an alarm system. Okay, easy. I mean,
[2257.16s -> 2264.52s]  I want these. Okay, so is he here? There's another chest there.
[2264.52s -> 2291.61s]  Okay, purchase. What do you got here? All right. Boost rune acquisition for a time. What?
[2292.33s -> 2304.02s]  That's what that does? Market's shackle briefly binds market once imprisoned to earth.
[2306.30s -> 2324.73s]  What? Is this a way to make that fight easier? Ooh, you got a key. What? Okay.
[2325.53s -> 2333.32s]  It's like gas coins music box. Okay. Well, that's where that is. Harrying dagger. That's what that
[2333.80s -> 2340.84s]  is. Horse crest, wooden shield, sacrificial twig. Oh, this is if you die, um, you don't lose your
[2340.84s -> 2352.95s]  runes. I kind of want these. You're like, I need to go, I feel like going to that kind of farming
[2352.95s -> 2361.80s]  zone that I was in before turning that on and just, I wonder how long it lasts. I should,
[2361.80s -> 2365.59s]  he also has sells one of these too. All right. What's in the chest? Let me ask him about the
[2365.59s -> 2370.55s]  bands though. Maybe he's got something on your shopping list. No, no trouble to me. What's
[2370.55s -> 2375.70s]  going on? And it's make a clean break. Now they're all suppliers,
[2375.70s -> 2382.41s]  no good ones at that. I mean, I understand a word I'm saying, but it hardly matters.
[2383.13s -> 2388.65s]  We have a natural connection. They're all foot soldiers, survivors of the defeated army
[2389.45s -> 2394.65s]  work to the bone by their high and mighty Lord only to be thrown out with the rubbish.
[2395.45s -> 2402.33s]  Ah, it's the same old story everywhere I go to hell with it. How does patches keep getting
[2402.33s -> 2409.91s]  in every single universe? That's what I want to know that chest over there. Yep.
[2410.63s -> 2421.59s]  What's inside the treasure chest? Well, it's nothing too special. You do something to me
[2421.59s -> 2436.60s]  again. I'm going to be a trap. And besides this valuable customer could be a long time coming.
[2438.33s -> 2443.29s]  Everything is given take. Yeah. Give and take. There's going to be a, there's going to be a
[2443.29s -> 2448.01s]  bomb in there. Okay. So we might as well just open it so you guys can laugh at the
[2448.01s -> 2451.77s]  fucking explosion that happens in my face. So we're like the poison gas. Here we go.
[2451.77s -> 2465.54s]  Well, well, well, I should have known.
[2478.33s -> 2496.71s]  Okay. Could have rolled away. He's just a cat. Where the fuck did you put me?
[2497.51s -> 2538.73s]  Give me whatever that is. Well, that's got a huge arc map. Get it before I die. Stagger.
[2560.50s -> 2585.66s]  Oh, damn. I got dead. I actually got the full charge. I actually got it.
[2586.63s -> 2591.16s]  That was almost 800 damage. Damn. Okay. Cool. So where am I?
[2592.36s -> 2599.78s]  I'm great. East. This is exactly where I want it to go. You put me in the exact area I wanted to be
[2599.78s -> 2616.34s]  in. Thanks patches. You're a real friend. Let me get to a road though. There's a big, what's this
[2616.34s -> 2640.18s]  big tree? Is that the, the Elden tree? Whatever the thing's called. Oh, what are the, what are
[2640.18s -> 2655.75s]  these? Are these just refill your flasks? I think these are flask refillers. Spiked cracked tier.
[2656.95s -> 2665.77s]  Greenspill crystal tier. What's that? Temporarily boosts stamina in mixed
[2666.65s -> 2671.05s]  physics. Enhances charge attacks for a time in mixed physics. What is, what is this
[2671.05s -> 2685.45s]  physics thing? Unlock the rune you got from Godric please. What do you mean? Oh, this is a minor
[2685.45s -> 2701.90s]  elder tree. That's a refillable potion. Really? I have to go to a tower to unlock it. Oh. Well,
[2701.90s -> 2709.43s]  I don't know that yet. Spoiled me. Actually, I did know that. All right. This is kind of an ocean
[2709.43s -> 2721.02s]  here. Minor urd tree. Why is that on here? There's a reason why that's here, right? It's on the map.
[2721.82s -> 2736.17s]  What? Like a dungeon? Or is it just, hey, here's one of them. That looks like I can get in there,
[2736.17s -> 2759.42s]  doesn't it? That looks like I can get in there. Oh, what's this? An observatory. Whoa. Where am I?
[2759.42s -> 2770.20s]  What the fuck? This game is fucking insane. This is crazy. That is this much as random shit for you
[2770.20s -> 2810.55s]  just to go do. I need a, okay. Is there a fire down here? I hope so. Find out. What the fuck?
[2810.55s -> 2821.59s]  This is such a huge elevator. How long is this ride? My head would have exploded from the
[2821.59s -> 2865.29s]  underwater pressure by now. See you for a river. Well, we got one. Okay. I don't have enough to
[2865.29s -> 2872.02s]  level up. Um, I think my flasks are okay. I think five and two is fine. Let's take a look.
[2873.38s -> 2923.32s]  What's this shit? Okay. Well, there's a summoning statue thing here. Oh, okay. Rune. We're calling
[2923.32s -> 2945.02s]  finger. I might just sell a lot of the PVP stuff and all the items don't know. Stone unturned
[2945.02s -> 2974.34s]  silver firefly, which is also new. No stone unturned ruins. All right. Where's the, where's the,
[2974.34s -> 2979.37s]  where's the guy that's going to be around the corner with like a giant? Yeah. The casters,
[2987.70s -> 2995.58s]  they look like casters. Those are stale. Those are staves. Those are staves. These casters,
[3004.95s -> 3008.15s]  they casters and not, they just have shiny things. All right, let's go.
[3008.95s -> 3043.06s]  We know how to deal with groups. You're in slow motion. We know how to deal with groups. Not bad.
[3043.06s -> 3076.10s]  Immune to that. What the fuck was that hit box, hum? These guys do not get staggered really.
[3077.22s -> 3108.49s]  It's so slow. It's so weird. That takes care of that. Rune probably. Oh, nice. I need a five
[3108.49s -> 3123.70s]  somber stone, right? What is that? Oh my God. It's like a shining thing up there.
[3124.34s -> 3136.87s]  That's like a hyper item. Look up. What do you want me to look up for? Why is there a Riddler?
[3136.87s -> 3147.94s]  Why is the Riddler here? Oh no, it's a golden centipede. There's nothing. Stop. I don't know
[3147.94s -> 3162.87s]  what you're talking about. Runes. I wonder if I can just like, do these guys have any brains at all?
[3162.87s -> 3181.86s]  Probably not. They're so slow. Yeah, all right. Look up. Look up. Look up. It's structure and
[3182.50s -> 3194.20s]  bones and material and shit. What do you want? It's mountains. It's this like, it's like a sky
[3194.20s -> 3201.27s]  with rocks and wood. All right. I'm not looking up anymore. I'm not getting baited like over
[3201.27s -> 3295.19s]  and over again. Hurts a lot. Exploded. That was definitely it. No. Stop. These guys hit so hard
[3295.19s -> 3306.97s]  and they're just so slow. You're in slow motion. You make me angry. All right. What does that thing
[3306.97s -> 3317.54s]  do? I think it's just a big AOE. I can't really get behind him. So we're just going to have to.
[3319.93s -> 3338.52s]  Those go. No, I can't pull them. So it's not, I don't even need to try.
[3344.07s -> 3359.88s]  Immunizing cured meat. Oh, I want to do this. Why can I backstab him?
[3361.77s -> 3374.97s]  Rainbow stones. Those things that make it so you can don't get lost.
[3375.93s -> 3385.29s]  Which in this game, they actually might be very useful. Unlike previous games where it really
[3385.29s -> 3395.80s]  kind of didn't matter that much. Previous games, those little pebbles or pool, but
[3396.60s -> 3415.58s]  you're like in a game like this, they're way more helpful. What does it, what are the,
[3415.58s -> 3421.08s]  wow, there's so many people over here. For what? There are a shitload of you here. Is
[3421.08s -> 3428.84s]  there something here? I'm just going to, I'm not going to fight these guys.
[3430.20s -> 3446.82s]  Is there an item? I don't see an item. Mushrooms. Just chilling. Yeah. I don't see anything else.
[3447.38s -> 3450.18s]  I think that's just kind of, you don't have to go through the front door. Unless it's something
[3450.18s -> 3460.97s]  there, the glowing, I don't see it. No, I think that's just all their steps. There's nothing here.
[3460.97s -> 3471.21s]  Okay. Well, let's get going. Do I have scarlet rod? I don't believe so.
[3471.93s -> 3486.26s]  Wouldn't that be on the screen? What about over here? Yep. Item right there.
[3487.14s -> 3491.67s]  Game's too dark. Turn up the brightness. I think that's intentional.
[3495.19s -> 3502.10s]  I think I was going to see you back here. Did you? No, kill it. Please. No, kill it.
[3504.39s -> 3519.58s]  I thought it was going to be an item. Okay. Right here.
[3520.30s -> 3533.82s]  Utting horn. I have to sit down and craft. I have my, I have like five backpacks full of stuff that
[3533.82s -> 3567.61s]  I haven't even opened. So this is probably a boss door. Big waterfall. Interesting. Oh, ghost
[3567.61s -> 3576.52s]  glove wart. That's really important. I could probably go through the waterfall. It's definitely
[3576.52s -> 3587.54s]  like a secret thing to go through. Dude, I'm sorry. I'm not going to like pick up an item over here
[3587.54s -> 3628.84s]  and have 10 of you get up and kill me. Backstabbing takes too long. Just kill him. Damn it. Come here.
[3635.45s -> 3652.81s]  That thing is good, but they just have so much health. Clayman's harpoon? These people have made
[3652.81s -> 3668.87s]  it to clay? Clayman's harpoon. What else here, right? I want to see what that is.
[3674.84s -> 3682.63s]  Int scaling? Harpoon with a tip made from a sharpened meteorite shard built by the claymen
[3682.63s -> 3705.40s]  who infest dynastic remains. Blade emits a faint light and deals magic damage. That's cool. So
[3705.40s -> 3714.09s]  that's like a magic damage thrust. That's actually really good. Another ink weapon. That's awesome.
[3714.09s -> 3720.92s]  All right. I'm not going to get rid of this in case I need it for something. Okay. Let me put my
[3720.92s -> 3724.84s]  other weapon on the one I'm actually going to use. Now I'm fat rolling, so that's going to hurt.
[3724.84s -> 3740.31s]  I think stone. The phone's got to go back in. Let's go. All right. There's no way there's not
[3740.31s -> 3750.87s]  something in the waterfall, right? Impossible. When has there ever been a video game? Soap.
[3751.51s -> 3787.40s]  Is there soap in the waterfall? What the fuck? Is it a crafting material? Soap removes filth
[3787.40s -> 3799.74s]  and accumulations on the body. What? Filth covering the exterior eventually seeps into soap. If you
[3799.74s -> 3813.67s]  get dirty of this. Okay. Filth is in the game. I imagine that's poison buildup. Maybe. All right.
[3813.67s -> 3821.85s]  Well, here's the big door. It's time to find out what's going on here. Although I might want to
[3821.85s -> 3826.33s]  not do this yet because I have a lot of runes. I can probably level up before I get killed by whatever
[3826.33s -> 3837.22s]  the enemy is up here. Those guys are so slow. It'd be so easy to get back here.
[3840.50s -> 3862.46s]  I think it's time to be a coward. Yeah. Time to be a coward. Coward time. I have way. Oh yeah. I
[3862.46s -> 3877.34s]  could definitely level up in these like 11,000. One of these will do it. Actually maybe three of
[3877.34s -> 3920.87s]  them and eight, a little more. Is that was enough? It's probably 11 or 12. 13. 13. What? And then
[3920.87s -> 3932.36s]  one more of these. Look at that perfect calculation. 13, one nine six. I will have
[3932.36s -> 3982.34s]  zero souls left. Kill these guys and that's it. That's a huge knockback too.
[3990.33s -> 3998.92s]  All right. Let's go. Level up. Kill one of these guys with your eyes closed. Fine. Ready?
[4000.97s -> 4025.26s]  What do I want to put the point into? Mind probably I said, right? Mind. Yes, I do.
[4025.26s -> 4034.12s]  20. Mind gets us our friend Oleg finally. You can do wield the spheres.
[4034.84s -> 4043.88s]  Actually pretty crazy. All right. We'll be good. I got two, one. We'll see. We need to upgrade the
[4043.88s -> 4050.74s]  boys. I actually was talking to Holly last night. I was like, man, I really don't know what to do
[4050.74s -> 4055.46s]  because like if I don't get the boys to plus 10, everyone's going to be fucking pissed. And like
[4056.10s -> 4059.78s]  they're going to be mad at me for not doing that. But what if like Oleg's not that good? And what
[4060.10s -> 4064.39s]  if that is the right play? I was like, I don't know. I wonder what I should do.
[4065.27s -> 4073.38s]  Like if I don't upgrade the boys to at least like plus five and I'll never hear the end of it.
[4073.38s -> 4088.34s]  There'll be like a meme on the channel for like another three years. Can I get up here?
[4088.98s -> 4092.42s]  Just look at that. There's like a huge, there's like a giant sparkling item over there.
[4095.62s -> 4101.26s]  I can definitely get up there from here. Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.
[4101.90s -> 4116.55s]  Oh, can I, maybe I can. That was just the earth exploding sound from rapidly.
[4122.14s -> 4144.23s]  It was actually that sound. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Not bad. He's going to explode.
[4144.23s -> 4155.35s]  Do it.
[4158.79s -> 4195.88s]  Watch out for the little bubbles. All right. What happened? Okay. Throwing dagger. Now wait,
[4199.29s -> 4206.18s]  dropping down here gets me that. Oh, okay. I gotta be careful. There's a ledge here though.
[4206.66s -> 4216.25s]  Wait, I'm not done exploring because there's no air to go over here too. God. All right.
[4216.25s -> 4249.42s]  Can I make that jump? I can't make this jump. Wait, what was the point of that?
[4249.42s -> 4260.70s]  Nothing over here. Really? Why would they have a jump here?
[4264.55s -> 4284.33s]  Oh, come on. Really? No, it's gotta be something. I guess not. So let's drop here. Right there.
[4284.97s -> 4303.38s]  Okay. I gotta be careful. Oh, the bubbles. That's the bubble spell.
[4306.25s -> 4318.94s]  Bubble spell. That thing looked like it was a piece of shit though. I need arcane. There's
[4318.94s -> 4322.22s]  several small magical bubbles that drift towards foes before they naturally pop.
[4323.02s -> 4339.78s]  I'm not going to do arcane. That's cool. Um, I wonder if I should be putting any points into
[4339.78s -> 4352.50s]  arcane at all. How come this, wait, why the runes respond? The items respond down here?
[4353.06s -> 4362.86s]  Did I just not pick that one up? Will Diablo four be the Elden Ring of Diablo two? No,
[4367.29s -> 4377.59s]  not. I don't think a chance in hell. I'm sorry if I'm honest. Arcane is luck.
[4390.46s -> 4396.06s]  Look up, Jermo. Look up. Whoa, what the fuck? It's like there's an arc here. This is one of
[4396.06s -> 4418.44s]  these like arc building. Is that a map? How far am I going here? I'm going like, where am I? Okay.
[4418.44s -> 4451.46s]  There's bugs here. Just checking. You never know. Reserving ballaces. Holy fuck. Sorcery falls off
[4451.46s -> 4457.98s]  hard later on. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's why I got to make sure I'm prepared
[4457.98s -> 4463.02s]  and that I have enough like decks and other shit. And I have like an int scaling weapon
[4463.58s -> 4467.66s]  like this to make sure that I can complete the video game. And those people that were saying
[4468.54s -> 4476.31s]  that I'm a, I'm a noob. I saw a bunch of people called me noobs, I thought. And it was not making
[4476.31s -> 4482.39s]  me happy. And I'm giving you the reason why. Oh, I had a dream. This is perfect. Okay. Perfect
[4482.39s -> 4488.95s]  opportunity. I had a dream last night. Let me explain this. So in the dream, I was like walking
[4488.95s -> 4493.43s]  around, I think it was like my like apartment or my house, whatever. Like I was just in like an
[4493.43s -> 4502.31s]  apartment or something. And it was this little crab like this, tiny, tiny, tiny. And it was just,
[4502.31s -> 4508.86s]  it was as big as I would say, not as big as a tarantula, but a lot bigger than a house spider.
[4509.50s -> 4518.78s]  It was like, it was as big as a crab. So this was a crab, like a small crab. And it was just kind
[4518.78s -> 4523.98s]  of walking around little, just like walking around and it had like a, like a, what looked like a stick
[4524.54s -> 4530.57s]  in its hand. It had this long, like almost sharpened stick. And it was just kind of like
[4530.57s -> 4536.65s]  walking around holding it. And there was like a little tiny little shield that was, I would say
[4536.73s -> 4542.09s]  maybe a foot or two away from where the crab was. So it's holding like a little sharpened stick,
[4542.09s -> 4545.85s]  walking around. And there was like three or four other people in this house. And we were like,
[4545.85s -> 4549.37s]  what the fuck's going on here? Holy shit. You see what's in your house. I don't think we were in my
[4549.37s -> 4552.65s]  place. We were in somebody else's. I don't even know who these people were. So it's like, dude,
[4552.65s -> 4557.37s]  what the fuck is going on? This crazy. And this crab comes, kind of goes over it, picks up this
[4557.37s -> 4561.29s]  little tiny shield. It's like, what's going on? This is like, get a camera, somebody get a fucking
[4561.29s -> 4569.77s]  camera or something. And then like the distance was another little crab that had the same items.
[4571.29s -> 4575.53s]  And they like started to go towards each other. And it was like, what the fuck they're going to
[4575.53s -> 4579.69s]  fight. They're going to like, this is going to be like a sword fight. They get close enough
[4579.69s -> 4585.93s]  where they just barely start to like whack at each other. And I don't know if this is like the
[4585.93s -> 4592.17s]  person's dog that owned this place, but this big golden retriever just like runs over and like,
[4593.21s -> 4597.37s]  starts like fucking biting and like biting them and shit and freaking out. And the whole house was
[4597.37s -> 4602.73s]  like, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, get the dog, get the dog. Like it sprinted over and
[4602.73s -> 4606.57s]  started to like go after them. Like kind of sniff, bite, bite, sniff, sniff. Like it was like,
[4606.57s -> 4610.25s]  you know how dogs are, right? It's just something like a little bug or something sometimes. And it
[4610.25s -> 4616.57s]  was like, get the dog. What the fuck is happening? It was chaos. It was absolute chaos. Like this
[4616.57s -> 4622.01s]  golden retriever like literally was not even in my field of view. And it like slid into frame,
[4622.01s -> 4628.49s]  like it's pause. It was like, it just started freaking out. And it was like such panic and such
[4628.49s -> 4633.05s]  chaos because it was like, I don't, but they have like sharpened stuff. We don't want the dog to get
[4633.05s -> 4637.61s]  fucking hurt. Like we don't, I didn't even know you had a dog. Like it was crazy. It was, and then I
[4637.61s -> 4659.99s]  woke up. It was just absolute mayhem for like five seconds. And then I woke up. Somebody said,
[4660.63s -> 4673.21s]  dude, you have, why are you having viral video dreams? Yeah. That's just like something crazy.
[4673.21s -> 4681.21s]  That would be like on like TikTok for 10 seconds. Oh dude. There's like this weird bug here.
[4682.01s -> 4691.30s]  Dog runs in. No, no, no, no. Only in my version they had weapons. So it was scarier.
[4692.02s -> 4701.96s]  You're having Zoomer humor dreams. Yeah. Cause everybody kept was like yelling,
[4701.96s -> 4706.76s]  no, put it down, drop it, drop it. Like, don't do that. And I think, I think he like was just,
[4706.76s -> 4709.48s]  I don't know. I couldn't even tell what was happening. It was just chaos.
[4717.45s -> 4723.64s]  Oh, it was so weird. Like they were going to go fight each other. Like I think it was because
[4723.64s -> 4729.38s]  of the crabs in the game. Don't ask me why. Like I had, I mean, I, I know why I had like a dark
[4729.38s -> 4747.86s]  souls dream. This one's way more aggressive. Yeah. I know why I'm having like weird, like
[4747.86s -> 4753.16s]  sword and shield dark souls dreams. It's because of this. Don't ask me where the golden retriever
[4753.16s -> 4762.78s]  came from. And it was one of those golden retrievers that was like super big and a little
[4762.78s -> 4769.74s]  chunky tons of hair. Like that, like kind of that golden hair. It was that kind of chunky and like
[4769.74s -> 4790.63s]  big crab eggs. All right. So what is going on over here? This is, this is kind of, this is a
[4790.63s -> 4816.58s]  long little area. No map, which cause it's a dungeon. Why would there be a map? Okay. Map
[4816.58s -> 4826.25s]  right there. See ask and ye shall receive. God, what the hell is this? Wait, why? There's a map
[4826.25s -> 4856.65s]  down here. How big is this place? There's another bonfire. This is ridiculous. Okay. So where the
[4856.65s -> 4872.14s]  hell am I? How did I, I don't even know how I got here. Light the flame. Hey, that's not a map.
[4878.52s -> 4889.75s]  Maybe I have to light up a bunch of beacons or something. Okay. Well nevermind. All right. We
[4889.75s -> 4904.73s]  got this way, that way, that way. I'm going to go this way. This place is huge. Let's go left.
[4905.53s -> 4914.70s]  That's not funny what you just did. It's annoying. I know that like Elden Ring, all the From Software
[4914.70s -> 4918.22s]  games are there. They're pure comedy games. What you just did didn't make me laugh. It made me angry.
[4918.94s -> 4927.43s]  Get away from me. What the? All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is this?
[4928.23s -> 4938.79s]  This guy doesn't seem to care. I'm waiting for you to get out of the way. Is this like an NPC?
[4938.79s -> 4961.46s]  Why does this guy not care that I'm here? Barbarian? Okay. That guy was just collecting
[4961.46s -> 4964.82s]  babies. Why did you? Get away. Just leave me alone. I don't want to fight that thing.
[4968.04s -> 4999.03s]  Oh, it's a, it's a fun. Come here. Maybe it'll eat out of my hand. Long wind up. I got long winds
[4999.03s -> 5008.73s]  ups. I'm back against a tree. Get rid of it. I'm looking up his ass.
[5010.60s -> 5014.20s]  Camera's just pointed directly in his ass. Like get me the fuck away from him.
[5055.48s -> 5087.45s]  Okay. I'm glad I did that. Okay. Like how many fucking times in a row do these guys swing?
[5092.92s -> 5099.40s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay. Now play the game. Now fight me.
[5099.40s -> 5125.45s]  I want to kill this thing so bad. Now fuck you. You just, you're just, you're just in the fucking
[5125.45s -> 5134.71s]  way. These crabs, seriously. It's like, why are there so many crabs in Elden Ring? There's,
[5134.71s -> 5141.77s]  there's huge crabs everywhere. They're in every area. We're down in like this downtown magical
[5141.77s -> 5169.59s]  fucking like Disney, like Hades area. And there are this seafood here. What? Okay. Get off the
[5169.59s -> 5178.04s]  horse. I'm not, I'm, let's go. Give me a break. Not playing around here. There's a guy over,
[5178.04s -> 5187.75s]  I got collapsed on. That's what happened. So let's not get collapsed on. And there he is. Okay. So
[5187.75s -> 5211.80s]  this is, this is a problem. There. Mad because crab. Mad because crab. Mad because crab.
[5212.52s -> 5225.85s]  There's crabs everywhere. They, they might just spawn. Maybe they just show up.
[5228.06s -> 5250.39s]  They do. Okay. I was wondering like, what the fuck is happening? Oh, there's a beacon here.
[5251.11s -> 5268.34s]  Get out of the way. It's whatever you are at this too. I wish you could pet the animals.
[5268.90s -> 5277.85s]  Don't you think that'd be kind of funny if you could like, who's that? Like if you could go up
[5277.85s -> 5294.86s]  and just be like, and they gave you plus one resolve. Okay. So that got that one and got this
[5294.86s -> 5304.20s]  one. I'm going to go the right side now. They're boys. You're a genuine American pleb. I was going
[5304.20s -> 5316.10s]  to say warthog, but pig was less syllables and I was angry. So that's why I said it early.
[5317.46s -> 5369.46s]  Okay. Stop picking your nose and play. We got over here. Hey, armorers cookbook.
[5372.30s -> 5381.30s]  Look at this. This is, this is ridiculous. Uh, like am I ever going to sit down and craft a single
[5381.30s -> 5391.99s]  item in elder? I have 117 of these. I have, I mean, what am I doing? Look at all these cookbooks.
[5396.23s -> 5410.25s]  I'm not even doing it. Just make soap from all of them. You're holding it just in case.
[5410.25s -> 5420.17s]  That's kind of what it feels like. I've already been, I've been, I've been down there, right?
[5420.89s -> 5439.11s]  I don't know. Have I, that's where I started, right? Yeah. So I got these fires lit that one.
[5439.11s -> 5443.11s]  I've got the one on the left. We're going to go right and see if I can't. And actually, you know,
[5443.11s -> 5447.72s]  let's rest at the balloon file because I don't care about those enemies over there responding.
[5447.72s -> 5463.02s]  Why do I care? All right, let's go like the one on the right and craft from the pause menu.
[5467.80s -> 5481.67s]  Um, blood loss. I can make, I can make 12 of these temporarily boost fire damage negation. I can make
[5483.94s -> 5497.86s]  four of these. I can make fire pots. What's even useful to make a cloud. What would even be useful?
[5497.86s -> 5507.67s]  Maybe this like, maybe this would be useful at some point. Maybe one of these fire. Yeah. Like
[5507.67s -> 5516.86s]  this is just, you cook, but can I even cope my weapon? Cause it's magic. Use the cookbooks.
[5519.74s -> 5538.04s]  I use them for my, my inventory. I can't use them from here. I have to turn them in. I think
[5538.04s -> 5543.88s]  that is there. It is auto. Okay. Well, I, I don't, I don't care. Okay. None of that stuff really is
[5543.88s -> 5548.82s]  pressing for me to do right now. Look, if I fight a boss and it's like, Oh wait, they're susceptible
[5548.82s -> 5553.62s]  to fire damage. And by the way, they do fire damage. Watch out. I can just like, I'll make like
[5553.62s -> 5575.74s]  a hundred of them. Why is there another game underneath the game? They made Elden ring. And
[5575.74s -> 5580.62s]  then they said, Oh, you know what? Um, yeah, we should make like a whole nother video game.
[5580.62s -> 5583.42s]  We're out of room on the map though. That's okay. Just put the whole thing underground.
[5584.15s -> 5587.75s]  There'd have to be two levels, like one under sea level, like whole entire video game. And then
[5587.75s -> 5592.15s]  one above sea level. How did they make this? How did they make this game? Do they have like
[5592.15s -> 5599.58s]  12,000 employees? How does this possible? They hid dark souls four in Elden ring.
[5601.99s -> 5604.87s]  Imagine like an announcement like that. Oh, by the way, I just want to let everybody know.
[5605.43s -> 5612.79s]  Uh, we actually made dark souls four and it's, we made it below sea level in Elden ring. So yeah,
[5612.79s -> 5615.75s]  there's like a whole other story down here. Uh, it's not, it's just optional. If you don't,
[5615.75s -> 5621.08s]  if you don't have to do it, who cares? Jesus. All right. I don't want to fight all these guys.
[5621.08s -> 5638.70s]  I just want the item, which there is just material leaf inverted Hawk heater shield.
[5638.70s -> 5645.58s]  That's definitely an anti-fire shield. Okay. Cool. I spent the item. There's no, uh, fire over here.
[5647.03s -> 5681.30s]  Very cool. The aggro. Okay. Um, I want to, he's not behind me, right? He is. He's coming.
[5681.94s -> 5687.62s]  He's got a bow. Will he shoot the ball or will he despawn? Leave me alone. I think I'm far enough
[5687.62s -> 5706.06s]  away. Why are you so annoying today? I'm annoying every day. Um, okay. He's gone. I've been using
[5706.06s -> 5713.53s]  this for, I don't think I need to use this one anymore. Medium sized metal shield easier to
[5713.53s -> 5718.76s]  handle than a kite shield. Inverted Hawk is an emblem of the company of slaves order to explore
[5718.76s -> 5728.81s]  the eternal city. And it's Perry. How is it different from anything else though? A hundred,
[5728.81s -> 5734.73s]  a hundred. It's a little more fire and a little more lightning, but that's big of a deal considering
[5734.73s -> 5741.80s]  that this is 58. This is not that great for fire or lightning, which I'm imagining. We're probably
[5741.80s -> 5748.22s]  not in the magic area right now, so maybe I'll just put it on. This is the best I have for fire
[5748.22s -> 5761.30s]  besides this, but I can't wear this or maybe it's lightning. We'll find out. All right, let's keep
[5761.30s -> 5791.75s]  going. Halloween grounds. Hollow horn. What is that? Is that a statue or is that, is that alive?
[5796.47s -> 5817.53s]  This thing is definitely alive and maybe it's not. I have, okay, I got a theory. My theory is
[5817.53s -> 5823.93s]  you light all the fires and then you come back up here and it stands up and then you fight it.
[5825.34s -> 5836.04s]  That's the theory I'm going with, so that's what we're doing. Yeah, yep, look at this. Yeah,
[5836.04s -> 5842.92s]  one, two, how many are there? I lit two. One, two, three, four, five, there's six more to light?
[5843.88s -> 5858.63s]  If it goes by that theory, then damn. All right, well, we got a lot to look at for that stuff to
[5858.63s -> 5882.62s]  light. Oh, goodbye. I see a fire over there. Your aim is unmatched and it annoys me. Oh,
[5882.62s -> 5899.16s]  there's a Mario thing. There's a Mario 64 thing. Let's try it. Whoa. I've never used one of these.
[5899.16s -> 5905.56s]  What? How does this work? What happened? I've never used one. What was that?
[5906.44s -> 5923.18s]  That just was fucking stupid. I didn't think it was going to go that high. That was too high.
[5923.18s -> 5931.53s]  You were facing the wrong way. I mean, I thought that those things were automatic.
[5932.09s -> 5935.96s]  I thought it was like, oh, go here, hit jump and it will put you, so I didn't think I had to like
[5935.96s -> 5961.93s]  actually steer the thing. Like I was on a wingsuit. Your urinal activated. I thought it hit me in
[5961.93s -> 5975.61s]  real life. I felt that it hit me in real life. Okay. So how does this work? Watch out. Watch out.
[5975.61s -> 5995.11s]  Watch out. Watch out. Be careful. Be careful. No, you're going too close to the edge. Be careful.
[5998.31s -> 6004.95s]  Oh my God. That was horrible. Okay. That would have been so sad, but I think everybody would have
[6004.95s -> 6032.15s]  laughed. I would have been one of them. How do I activate this? Jump. Dude, this is ridiculous.
[6032.15s -> 6043.62s]  We're, I'm in like another dimension. Glove wart. Yep. The more glove wart I get, the more that
[6043.62s -> 6060.10s]  there's a chance that the boys get to plus 10. It's just seeing if there's something down there
[6060.10s -> 6076.04s]  that might be whatever. That's for play through number two. What was the point? Nice. Actually
[6076.04s -> 6116.09s]  worth the binoculars in this game. Where are they? It's an invisible bridge. Oh, I'm sure there is.
[6117.78s -> 6120.74s]  Oh, it's an invisible bridge. Thanks guys. I appreciate the help.
[6122.63s -> 6128.49s]  Like it's an invisible bridge. You can walk over this. That's a great, really good idea. That's
[6128.49s -> 6139.21s]  very funny. Uh, even if it's true, I don't believe you. I fucking can't believe I live. Why would I
[6139.21s -> 6150.74s]  do that? I can't believe it. I figured like maybe everyone just spoiled that for me and like, okay,
[6150.74s -> 6161.62s]  whatever, we'll just go. Everybody in this chat needs to understand if I didn't do that for the
[6161.62s -> 6166.50s]  next 40 straight minutes, as long as it takes me to clean up in the morning, right? We would be
[6166.50s -> 6173.30s]  hearing back to the bridge, back to the bridge. Oh, bridge, bridge boys, uh, rise up bridge crew.
[6173.30s -> 6176.50s]  Hey, invisible bridge crew. That would have been, it would have been like an hour.
[6177.30s -> 6191.38s]  So I'm just getting in front of that. Uh, I have to go back up there. Don't kill me.
[6193.99s -> 6200.76s]  It's your voice. Oh, bridge crew shot an arrow like five minutes ago and it actually ended up
[6200.76s -> 6211.21s]  hitting me. But how do I get in the middle? Okay. I'm going to do something really weird here.
[6212.01s -> 6225.83s]  How do I get down from here? How am I supposed to get down? I want to try to go in the middle
[6225.83s -> 6235.22s]  area with as an item. I jump into this jumping into the stream of air. So, I mean, theoretically
[6235.22s -> 6243.08s]  that should work, right? But it might not try it. Wait, I can't get back over there.
[6243.08s -> 6252.78s]  How do I get home? How am I going to get back? I jump over there. Holy fuck. I almost didn't.
[6252.78s -> 6263.66s]  All right. So I want to go in the middle. This is not going to work.
[6273.80s -> 6297.24s]  Where am I going? I'm fine. What? I just want to go like this. My own head.
[6297.24s -> 6310.17s]  I was literally on purpose. It was on purpose because I purposefully thought that I could make
[6310.17s -> 6316.09s]  it down there without dying. It was on purpose. It was purpose behind it. You've got that. You've
[6316.09s -> 6335.02s]  got that first part, right? Okay. Where are they? Are they up there? Where's the fucking up there?
[6335.02s -> 6340.38s]  Why do they have to be up there? Oh my God. The game just ran forward and I just like freaking
[6340.38s -> 6349.21s]  freaked out. But I actually have to jump up there. That's annoying that it should be where
[6349.21s -> 6374.02s]  you land, not where you jump from. Okay. Let's try this now. Is that a person? It looks like a
[6374.02s -> 6380.86s]  guy with a cloak on. All right. Let me see if I can get in there from here. That's gonna kill
[6380.86s -> 6387.62s]  you, right? I want to, let's see. I have, this is going to be such a pain in the ass. Can I get in
[6387.62s -> 6392.02s]  there from here? If I just jump and then move forward at the very last second, I'm saying like,
[6393.26s -> 6403.13s]  no, wait, what if I do this? Wait, what's the jump? I couldn't jump. Why could I not double jump?
[6404.01s -> 6413.54s]  I was trying to double jump into that. I didn't get my second, I didn't get the jump.
[6415.70s -> 6420.82s]  I was going to fall, jump, like double jumping in the middle. You fell. You didn't jump. You
[6420.82s -> 6432.54s]  can do it still. You can only double jump after jumping. What? You have to jump to double jump.
[6433.10s -> 6438.54s]  Really though? Do I, I feel like I've done that before a few times. Hold on. Let me prove chat
[6438.54s -> 6461.70s]  wrong. Wrong, by the way. Wrong, by the way. Debunked. Why are you joke farming? I want to
[6461.70s -> 6480.70s]  get in there. I'm not farming jokes. I'm farming items and souls in the game. Sometimes I wish I
[6480.70s -> 6496.15s]  could just jump and like Yoshi this horse and like get further. Can I jump from the other side?
[6497.03s -> 6504.95s]  Find out. Is there a ledge like here or something that I can get on?
[6505.83s -> 6520.39s]  It kind of looks like it. What about here? All right. What happens if I do this?
[6521.11s -> 6560.87s]  Get off the horse. This is going to be a nightmare. Okay. Wait, I might have to jump. Remind me to
[6560.87s -> 6572.06s]  check that if I need to. Oh shit. I need to jump from the horse. I have to horse jump over there.
[6580.31s -> 6590.18s]  Too far? I know I got a horse jump over there. That's the only way I could have dropped. Wait,
[6590.18s -> 6607.27s]  what? No, it is the only way, isn't it? It's so funny. That would have been fucking hilarious
[6608.07s -> 6616.98s]  because I would have missed it and freaked out because it was right here. All right. There it
[6616.98s -> 6623.22s]  is. So what all this time and all this energy, what was it for? Oh, cool. Like bone arrows with
[6623.22s -> 6641.66s]  fucking goo on them. I'm glad I did all that. But there might be more. It's not. Now somebody that
[6641.66s -> 6671.74s]  is playing an archer build might go, holy shit. Nice. But that's not me. I'm going to go that way.
[6672.63s -> 6677.19s]  Can I skip that? If I just go there and jump across the whole thing, does that work?
[6677.19s -> 6680.47s]  I would imagine it does. And I'm probably going to get laughed at when it doesn't.
[6681.11s -> 6694.94s]  I mean, it might work. No, it's not going to work. And then why would I do that? I can literally go
[6694.94s -> 6713.43s]  right here. Okay. Some eagles just hanging up. I don't think so. I'm going to horse this time.
[6713.43s -> 6734.71s]  Idiot. Are there's another fire? Nice pop in. Oh, great pop in gameplay.
[6740.79s -> 6745.99s]  All right. Well, dude, all right. I'm this is ridiculous. There's so many people here.
[6746.79s -> 6754.78s]  How am I supposed to handle this? This is ridiculous. What? There's no way.
[6755.82s -> 6768.94s]  I think I just have to get off and run. It's going to be worth a lot of souls if I can kill it.
[6771.03s -> 6800.42s]  And you have magicians too. So there's magicians, axe wielders, sorcerers. Take out the archers
[6800.42s -> 6829.70s]  first. Anybody that has like magic can get rid of them too. Nice entrance. What happened to my horse?
[6829.86s -> 6843.45s]  What happened? What? They like staggered the horse. Why are there like 15 of you here?
[6843.45s -> 6852.94s]  That was going really well. It was until like somebody just and like somebody hits the
[6852.94s -> 6878.39s]  fucking horse's leg and then you get the gong sound and you fall down. Just I'm just going up
[6878.39s -> 6914.76s]  there and doing it. Is there really a need to fight like 30 people here? Okay. All right.
[6914.76s -> 6931.86s]  That's that one. I'll wrap around this edge. You piece of shit. Where are you doing that?
[6932.58s -> 6945.21s]  Okay. Give me a second. Should I pull these out? I don't know where that's coming from,
[6945.21s -> 6970.50s]  but I need to kind of know before I start moving. Okay. Yeah. It's a guy. Somebody in a tree shooting
[6970.50s -> 6984.52s]  me with these arrows. Where the fuck is this person? Like I was, I didn't even know. I couldn't
[6984.52s -> 7001.59s]  see him. Sniper on the hill. All right. Nice. Minecraft arrows run towards the arrow. That's
[7001.59s -> 7006.04s]  a good idea. I don't, I don't even know where the guy was and he could have been behind me
[7006.04s -> 7026.34s]  for all I knew. Okay. So where I died, this is the bullshit here. That's where that was. Okay.
[7026.34s -> 7055.82s]  Let's get this. Get my body. What was that? Fuck you guys. Why? Get out of the way. You stupid
[7055.82s -> 7071.13s]  animal. Get out of the way. Where are my souls? There. Hey, all right. Not stupid animal. Okay.
[7071.13s -> 7081.19s]  All right. I know. That was rude. I have to get off the horse and just like fight people,
[7081.19s -> 7088.57s]  right? Because like they're going to keep doing this shit. I mean, or like honest to God, like
[7088.57s -> 7096.66s]  what the fuck, man? Just fight them. Like they're not going to stop. They're going to keep spawning
[7096.66s -> 7114.82s]  on you until you've had it. There's another one right here. Okay. Sure. Did that come back?
[7115.46s -> 7120.52s]  Is that just like a defense mechanism for the tower? I don't, that's probably going to hurt a
[7120.52s -> 7142.92s]  lot. That one, this one, I'm going to just do a big circle because just do the perimeter.
[7142.92s -> 7154.81s]  There's probably another one or two around the perimeter. It's bonfire there, which is good.
[7154.81s -> 7175.42s]  This is so huge. All right. Bonfire. That's good. Take it. You see the clip of you twerking
[7175.42s -> 7193.06s]  during the VR stream. I lived it. I can go up there, but I'm into the, I'm trying to light
[7193.06s -> 7197.46s]  these fires here. So we're going to light the fires and blink a bunch of times because my
[7197.46s -> 7211.67s]  eyes need to be moisturized. I'm looking for fires. There's something all the way down here,
[7211.67s -> 7221.08s]  but I think this might be going too far. I think that's too far. I don't think they would put them
[7221.08s -> 7249.05s]  that far away. Although what the hell do I know? That's a backstab if I ever say that.
[7284.86s -> 7288.70s]  I'm going to assume there's probably one or two more down this way and then we can go
[7289.74s -> 7294.54s]  fight that boss in the middle. That it's probably optional, but let's do it. Why not?
[7306.66s -> 7326.26s]  I probably have enough to upgrade my weapon. We'll see. It feels like you're the baddie because
[7326.26s -> 7338.41s]  those monsters are just living peacefully with the wildlife. I love it. I live in like games
[7338.41s -> 7366.60s]  and like media play, but like your moral compass. It's kind of true though. It's a very,
[7366.60s -> 7372.74s]  it's a very pretty area. Somebody tried to hit me with a barrel. Sounded like it.
[7378.36s -> 7394.18s]  What is over there? We had some weird shit over there. Runes, waterfall. Oh,
[7406.57s -> 7426.18s]  oh, it's one of those weird beat snake animal features. Um, patches here. I just was setting
[7426.18s -> 7431.22s]  up shop. If you need anything, don't hesitate. Hell, you're a scoundrel, aren't you? I think
[7431.22s -> 7452.55s]  I'll see you later. Playing music. All right. Do, do patches right now in your room, wherever you
[7452.55s -> 7460.09s]  are and just tell me, and you're going to say, ah, that's Dewey Griffin. And that wasn't even
[7460.09s -> 7463.21s]  close to being Stuart Griffin. All right. I'm just going to, this is weird. There's a, somebody
[7463.21s -> 7502.20s]  playing music. I'm very interested. Whoa. Is that a bow and arrow that he's playing? I'm not going
[7502.20s -> 7526.78s]  to interrupt the song. Book, bunch of cookbooks. Oh man. He's got, look at all the keys he has.
[7529.69s -> 7540.04s]  I want those and I'll get this too. Really cool. Do I have anything that's expensive
[7540.04s -> 7554.30s]  that I just don't give a shit about? Not really. Maybe some of the weapons. Well, we know I'm not
[7554.30s -> 7561.21s]  using the, uh, sword sword. This is not going to happen. I'm not going to use this dagger.
[7562.01s -> 7566.09s]  No, I have the cool daggers if I ever wanted to use it for any reason. Uh, I'm not going to use,
[7566.09s -> 7571.37s]  wait, what if I dual welded it? Could be this thing. No, it's faith. I'm sorry. It's 500 souls.
[7571.37s -> 7579.56s]  Goodbye. All right. Same thing with these crossbows. No, I'm not going to use them.
[7580.20s -> 7586.57s]  I'll keep that just because it's fun to have. Uh, some of these shields might be good in certain
[7586.57s -> 7593.38s]  situations. Let's see. Yeah. They, I, you don't never throw away armor ever because it just
[7593.38s -> 7597.14s]  randomly has use that you just don't know about. In fact, I got a couple of new things I want to
[7597.14s -> 7618.09s]  look at, although I don't need to. Okay. How do you pronounce wield like that? Wield.
[7624.79s -> 7631.75s]  Okay. So I can afford, I'm just going to come back and buy the other key.
[7632.31s -> 7668.42s]  Like this is, that's, those are cheap. Those are really cheap. Um, I was seeing if anything was
[7668.42s -> 7685.26s]  behind him. I'm not fighting that. I just looking for the thing to turn on, which there was one over
[7685.26s -> 7703.22s]  here. I missed, didn't I? Oh yes. Oh, you've come to the right place. You need only unravel its
[7703.22s -> 7710.86s]  mysteries. It wasn't outside. I like yourself to begin. That's my favorite character in every
[7710.86s -> 7716.55s]  souls game. By the way, I wish they gave that guy way more screen time. I love that guy.
[7722.86s -> 7752.54s]  He needed it five times more screen time. That one right there until wait, buying those tears
[7752.54s -> 7759.08s]  will let you upgrade the blast. Really? Are you bullshitting me? Are you shitting me for content?
[7772.15s -> 7779.62s]  Should be one more. Is that actually, is that true? Cause I'll go back up there because my
[7779.62s -> 7789.93s]  flask is only at a plus one, which is sounds like it's probably terrible right now. Get out of here.
[7789.93s -> 7804.20s]  Tears are for respect. Is it, can I, let me go look at it. That's it. All signed and sealed.
[7804.84s -> 7811.34s]  I don't know. Whatever happens, you may think at all of me bad.
[7819.94s -> 7832.62s]  All right. Hey dude, I'm back and I want to ask you a quick question about the, how are the,
[7832.62s -> 7846.71s]  what are those tears do material needed by Rinala to grant rebirth? You lied to me.
[7847.67s -> 7871.70s]  Look up. It's nothing here. Different tears for flasks. Yeah. You guys, you guys had,
[7872.50s -> 7881.40s]  now we've got to run through like the weird thing over here. No, turn around. Damn it. It's too
[7881.40s -> 7887.18s]  late. It's not too late. I'm going back up there and I'll tell you why I'm going to crack a crunchy
[7887.18s -> 7895.43s]  because I want to buy that other key. I just forgot about it right there. And then please don't
[7895.51s -> 7930.26s]  fucking kill me. Like don't look up. That tear lets you rebirth and change stats with the moon
[7930.26s -> 7947.96s]  lady. Yeah. Why does he move around in the game? Like a panicked bug. Yeah. Let's see how you move
[7947.96s -> 7952.70s]  around when you're playing. Cause I'll tell you right now, if you are not sitting there like this
[7956.47s -> 7976.73s]  the whole time you play, then hypocrite Andy, when a guy appears behind you, if you, okay,
[7976.73s -> 7981.85s]  if I walk down this way and I don't know what's to my left and a guy jumps out and attacks me
[7981.85s -> 7985.13s]  and I don't know he's there and it's a surprise, I'm not going to go like this.
[7996.17s -> 8000.87s]  No, you're going to go like this. Even if you tried it, you're going to go,
[8003.58s -> 8007.02s]  yo, what the right. And then like everyone in the early friends are going to laugh
[8007.74s -> 8020.70s]  or you're at least going to go or you guys act like you have like balls of steel. Like you're just
[8020.70s -> 8036.81s]  like nothing ever makes me emote ever. I am like a stone, nothing. My courage precedes me
[8038.36s -> 8054.62s]  always, always customer. The reason why I'm buying these is because they're the cheapest I've seen
[8055.74s -> 8061.61s]  everywhere else. These are four or 5,000 gold. They're two. This guy's, this guy's very reasonable.
[8061.61s -> 8066.89s]  Next time I just say, I like this guy. I actually want to meet up with this guy again. I want to,
[8066.89s -> 8070.01s]  I want to be friends with this person. I don't want to just show up right here. That's,
[8070.01s -> 8080.78s]  that's a good price. That's a good price. I respect that guy. All right. Looking for the last,
[8081.50s -> 8093.90s]  I think there's only one more dollars gold. Yeah, but it's a spendable currency. I'm going to call
[8093.90s -> 8100.66s]  it like money, right? I'm going to call it money because it's just, it's money, whatever. It's
[8100.66s -> 8112.44s]  money that you can use to up to spend on yourself. Okay. It turns out I was right because are they
[8112.44s -> 8122.94s]  all lit? No, two more need to be lit. Got to find those last two straight up the middle.
[8122.94s -> 8137.50s]  Maybe it is for a little bit further out. Oh God. I'm not going in there yet. Not yet.
[8142.42s -> 8175.19s]  Turtles. There are two more. Oh, oh, I sensed it. It probably, you shouldn't even be shooting at me
[8175.19s -> 8181.18s]  by now. How do you still have sight? How does this person still have sight on me? They're across the
[8181.18s -> 8187.54s]  rest. They're across the whole game. You're literally, you're across the entire map. You're
[8187.54s -> 8205.43s]  across the entire zone. Stop running in a straight line. I'm running a straight line because I feel
[8205.43s -> 8221.94s]  like I'm far enough away where the guy can't shoot me with the born arrow, buddy. Wait, why is that
[8221.94s -> 8233.86s]  one of these here? Buddy. He's fuming. No, I'm fine. I'm just kidding. I think it actually is further
[8233.86s -> 8266.31s]  down. Like it's probably down here. Oh, there's two more. Let's continue. Thank you.
[8274.92s -> 8328.30s]  They glitched out. Are they stuck? Maybe stuck. That move actually is pretty good because with
[8328.30s -> 8339.24s]  more dexterity, that's going to be even faster. So I actually don't hate that move. What are they
[8339.24s -> 8357.90s]  doing? I wonder why they're doing that. Okay. Well, I got to get that. They're stomping. But why?
[8358.78s -> 8378.31s]  There's probably a reason why they're doing that. I don't want to get too overzealous and run off
[8378.31s -> 8392.38s]  the edge. Ash Fores square off. Another teleporter. Let's mark it. Those are the teleporters marked on
[8392.38s -> 8407.34s]  the map. They're not. They are not marked on the map. Okay. What's this place called? The river.
[8407.90s -> 8429.21s]  What's this place called? I got to clean this up. Uh, this guy, we already did this. I already did
[8429.21s -> 8438.94s]  this. Wrong guy. Still hates me. All right. What about C? What's the CEO? Sofra? What's this place
[8438.94s -> 8466.12s]  called? What's the place? Sofra village. Okay. Sofra has two teleporters. Okay. I'm not going
[8466.12s -> 8473.19s]  to go in them now because I'm busy. I am what you would call very busy because I only have two more
[8473.19s -> 8477.61s]  of these and then it's definitely a boss we fight. So sorry, we're not going in there and I have to
[8477.61s -> 8488.41s]  pee too. So I'm doing that before the fight as well. These guys are like, Oh, there's rats.
[8489.05s -> 8535.62s]  Why are they just hanging out with them? Stop panic dodging before I scream. All right. Here's
[8535.62s -> 8545.14s]  the, there's one more after this. I want to check this out over here though. There's a place I can
[8545.14s -> 8559.19s]  go up here. Is that it? There it is. That's the last one. I think we keep going this way though,
[8559.19s -> 8563.67s]  just for now, because there's a little ending over here. This is a little like observatory
[8563.67s -> 8578.31s]  or something. I don't know if they're going to shoot fucking arrow at me. So that's why I'm
[8578.31s -> 8600.02s]  freaking out. What the hell are those? Why are the, why were the sheeps rolling? Were they rolling
[8600.02s -> 8630.39s]  around? That was weird. Why would they go, why are they doing that? Sheep do that? It's got an item.
[8631.43s -> 8648.26s]  Golden rune and a rune arc on a rat. Holy shit. Was it worth killing then? What's up there?
[8649.06s -> 8668.95s]  Okay. We're, we're at this ending here. The fire. This is another boss right here.
[8671.45s -> 8678.90s]  It's all underground. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Okay. Well, there's definitely something right
[8678.90s -> 8685.58s]  here. Why would there not be, right? That's has to be a boss. Yeah. I can see like the lantern
[8685.58s -> 8691.75s]  whatever it is. All right. Let's go up there. We need to look down. Now we're doing look down spam.
[8692.55s -> 8748.49s]  Pretty. Really pretty. Two triangles. What's, what's the big deal? We're camp abandoned. Okay.
[8748.49s -> 8769.98s]  What is up? Yes. Let's check it out. Here we go. Clarifying horn charm. I have a third slot.
[8769.98s -> 8782.73s]  Raises focus. Wait. Oh, should I get the focus? What does that, what does that mean?
[8783.53s -> 8803.75s]  Where's this focus? Is that mana? Oh, what is focus in this game? Resistance to sleep
[8803.75s -> 8806.71s]  and bouts of madness. I already have a lot of that from intelligence, right?
[8807.83s -> 8812.09s]  That's kind of cool. All right. So what is it? What do you got? Who is it?
[8819.43s -> 8831.75s]  Can't go down here unless I spend the stone keys. Okay. I don't think I want to do that.
[8832.55s -> 8839.19s]  I don't think I want to do that. I will mark this though, because this is actually, I know
[8839.19s -> 8873.13s]  where that is. I'll just, I'll make a note of it though. It's not worth it. Well, I will see.
[8876.01s -> 8879.69s]  I'm not going to put it in because I have a few places I'd like to check out first. All right.
[8879.69s -> 8887.61s]  So there's that. That's cool. Let's actually go because that, yeah, because now I got to,
[8887.61s -> 8929.66s]  I got to light the last one. That last fire was back this way. All right. Is he aiming at
[8929.66s -> 8960.95s]  me? I think still actually turns out this thing is really good for stuff like this.
[8961.75s -> 8987.11s]  Cool. I got my flask filled up too. Thanks. All right. Final thing. Light it up. Here we go.
[8987.11s -> 8999.37s]  I want that. Whatever it is. I don't think I can get there yet. That's six. Our gather somewhere
[8999.37s -> 9017.56s]  in horned remains. Okay. How far away is that one? Like here, right? Like this thing here.
[9018.20s -> 9026.01s]  Uh, this one. After break. Yeah. I gotta go pee. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to refill my drink
[9026.81s -> 9032.20s]  and we will, I'll sit right here. We will be back and we will continue and we're going to fight
[9032.20s -> 9358.98s]  whatever that thing is up there. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, are you lean? Um,
[9361.86s -> 9368.09s]  maybe everywhere, but like the bottom of my stomach, it's kind of, I have like a big like
[9368.09s -> 9374.31s]  stomach now. See, I think it just kind of happens after you turn like 35. I think it just does.
[9375.03s -> 9399.69s]  I have like this, the dad's stomach. Okay. I am ready. Turn. Elden ring. Let's go. Oh,
[9401.06s -> 9409.91s]  here's the question. Do I have enough? I probably do. All right. Here's what we're doing. Boom.
[9414.57s -> 9442.17s]  That felt good. Boom. And boom. Anybody else's screen frozen? Shouldn't be. Now I only need
[9443.05s -> 9453.46s]  a few more things. I think your stream crash. No, I'm look, I'm here. Where's the Burger King
[9453.46s -> 9457.70s]  head from? Burger King head is from the academy. It's like, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if
[9457.70s -> 9463.85s]  you find it here every time, but it was on like a crab or something. All right. How much is it to
[9463.85s -> 9475.72s]  level up? I just gotta go kill one thing and I'm going to put it into, I'm going to put it into,
[9475.72s -> 9480.18s]  I want to get to vigor to 20. I'm falling behind on health here. I need to, I need to start putting
[9480.18s -> 9498.42s]  HP in. Let me just do that. Eight. That's it. Did you kill something? Just spawn those guys.
[9498.42s -> 9516.54s]  They spawn everywhere when I don't want them. And now I don't know where they are. Backstab.
[9517.42s -> 9535.19s]  I need, I was going to get to 14,000 or whatever. These potions are so bad. I need to find,
[9535.19s -> 9538.79s]  I'm surprised I haven't found any more of those tiers. I only have a plus one flask.
[9539.67s -> 9545.75s]  I need to drink two potions to heal bar, which is not, that's not good.
[9548.20s -> 9556.17s]  I need to find more of those damn things. The island to the south.
[9556.81s -> 9561.72s]  I might have to do that sooner rather than later because I'm going to fall behind hard here.
[9581.37s -> 9588.73s]  I'm just, I just want to get souls quickly and I'm just, I'm counteracting the whole point here.
[9589.61s -> 9602.38s]  There we go. Okay. Uh, one more should do it. In fact, I probably, I, these little like weird
[9602.38s -> 9625.02s]  weasel things. I'm sorry. I'm, I can't do it. It looked at me. It looked at me. You've waited.
[9625.58s -> 9638.92s]  I'm surprised at level three that doesn't down. Okay. That's enough.
[9639.80s -> 9666.26s]  But I get into health and let's go to that, uh, weird animal statue. Let's move. This one's
[9666.26s -> 9680.54s]  probably better classes. This, uh, I started with prisoner. She got down to say hello.
[9681.18s -> 9696.60s]  Yeah, this is better. Rest of this one. Uh, I'm going to put on the boys
[9697.24s -> 9707.85s]  as just to see how they are here. And I'm also going to probably put,
[9714.10s -> 9719.70s]  yeah, I can't imagine that I'm going to be sitting there casting very many spells.
[9719.70s -> 9735.75s]  So let's go. Here we go. All the beacons have been lit. Take a sip of my, uh,
[9736.55s -> 9739.67s]  you can drink whatever you want. I got matcha tea here. Let me go and take a sip.
[9742.89s -> 9748.92s]  Some good matcha. All right, here we go. Let's do it. I can be on the horse.
[9749.72s -> 9768.98s]  Should I be on the horse? It's not, I can do it. I do hutch. Oh, I can touch it.
[9769.94s -> 9782.41s]  Oh, I thought he was going to stand up. Okay. So we touched the remains and then
[9786.54s -> 9807.42s]  inside of his dream or something. Ancestor spirit double jump one, two, and then land.
[9808.22s -> 9832.23s]  It's a fire. No, it's okay. It's all right. So he goes down for a second.
[9833.03s -> 9856.62s]  Oh, I just got horse kicked. Two, three, four. Oh shit. Great. That's two.
[9856.62s -> 9880.23s]  Watch out. That's right on top of him. Two. No, that's just the head.
[9887.08s -> 9941.13s]  Oh, this is so pretty. Okay. That's a, that goes three, right? Oh, didn't do three.
[9948.14s -> 9981.05s]  No, I wonder if this is phase two. This feels very phase two. Stamina lying around. I like the way
[9981.05s -> 10035.99s]  that looks, the lighting. That was really cool. Ancestral follower ashes. That wasn't too bad.
[10037.32s -> 10045.43s]  That was, that was, that was like a relaxing fight. Ancestral follower ashes. Cool. And 10,000,
[10045.43s -> 10057.50s]  12,000. Cool. Lost to Jerma. Yeah, that one was good. Is there anything else I can do here?
[10062.65s -> 10065.13s]  That's, that's someone is sick too. Really?
[10067.38s -> 10079.74s]  All right. Anything else here is that, but I don't want to miss anything. Will I miss something?
[10080.62s -> 10085.34s]  Okay. So just save me like the 10 straight minutes it's going to take me to walk around
[10085.34s -> 10090.71s]  in a circle. Do you guys even know? I don't think anyone would even know the area. Would
[10090.71s -> 10099.13s]  anybody even know? That was really pretty. That was a nice like kind of change from the,
[10100.31s -> 10105.11s]  like smash my controller into a hundred pieces. It was just like nice. It was just very enjoyable.
[10105.67s -> 10127.93s]  Okay. Antlers too, like the magical dust. That was, I liked that one. Okay. So now what? I think I
[10127.93s -> 10133.05s]  can, it was one area that I couldn't, it was at the gate, right? Over here. Let me try going up
[10133.05s -> 10143.06s]  the gate. Should be going this way right here. And then through this way. Cause I can go over here.
[10148.10s -> 10152.47s]  You do the teleports. Let me check this out. I'm just going to run. I'm going to run from here.
[10155.59s -> 10158.95s]  Why was everybody telling me to look up here and look down and look up? Was it just bullshit?
[10159.67s -> 10167.61s]  I was literally just here. Um, I got to level up again because I don't want to die.
[10168.33s -> 10198.68s]  Nothing's so annoying. Bastard. Uh, what is it? 15, 16,000 to level up again.
[10199.48s -> 10218.73s]  Spend those souls on gummy bears. All right. I want to go this way. It's definitely going
[10218.73s -> 10224.95s]  to be another fire. I think I have to be up, right? Cause I'm all the way down.
[10226.87s -> 10238.62s]  I gotta be way, I'm the wrong place. I gotta go over here. I gotta go back like that way. Back
[10238.62s -> 10249.72s]  when I was on all those things. Go over to the right. Maybe I should just go back here
[10250.44s -> 10258.63s]  and run from here through, through there. I need to get to this area. It just doesn't matter. Like
[10258.63s -> 10272.58s]  right in the middle. Oh, you need a teleporter. You just, you can't just walk. Oh, I can't,
[10273.30s -> 10282.33s]  I can't just get up there. Teleportable. Oh yeah. I just can't do it. All right. Well, I'll go,
[10282.33s -> 10286.25s]  let's go to the teleporter. One of the teleporters that was here. It was one right here.
[10287.13s -> 10292.76s]  The elevator. I don't want to use them right now. There are no, I only have a certain amount.
[10293.48s -> 10303.88s]  I don't want to use them. Okay. Let's go on the teleporter. Where was it? It was like right here,
[10303.88s -> 10314.90s]  right? What was it? It was like over here. It's edge. You really should restart the game.
[10318.97s -> 10323.50s]  I wonder, you know, it's going to be really interesting eventually.
[10326.26s -> 10339.66s]  What all the speed runners do. Imagine this game speed ran. How, where do you go? Really?
[10340.22s -> 10361.03s]  This is where you took me. Is it just to go between those two? What's the point of that?
[10366.44s -> 10378.01s]  There's no point in doing that. The speed run is a boss there. Okay. Let me check that out right
[10378.01s -> 10382.90s]  there. And I get to that from here. And if not, then I'm just going to go back and we'll continue
[10382.90s -> 10390.94s]  to trek through. Don't you just love, I've been playing for almost three hours and this whole
[10390.94s -> 10400.04s]  three hours has been me stumbling upon a random ass place and fighting a boss that was at the end
[10400.04s -> 10404.68s]  of it. And it was really fun and cool. And the area is crazy. I haven't done, this was just,
[10404.68s -> 10408.04s]  oh, what's this gazebo? And then I walked in it and here we are three hours later.
[10408.92s -> 10429.80s]  Oh yeah. That's remarkable. All right. Well, I can act, I can still explore up here and I get
[10429.80s -> 10446.33s]  even further up. Is there a reason to go on that? Probably not. I love getting flasks,
[10446.33s -> 10456.15s]  but I would really like a seed to make it so I don't have a plus one flask. All right. Hold on,
[10456.15s -> 10469.53s]  settle down. Going this way. Hey, over here. You want a hint for that? Or do you want to find it
[10469.53s -> 10474.09s]  on your own? Um, I would say if it begins to start to become like a real problem where I actually
[10474.09s -> 10480.25s]  don't come across them at all over the next like couple hours, maybe because I cannot have one
[10480.25s -> 10503.02s]  flask. That's going to be horrible. That's what I mean. Still haven't used any of those. I believe
[10503.02s -> 10521.13s]  we have exhausted everything we can do in this area. For now. For now. How do I get out of here?
[10521.13s -> 10539.43s]  Do the elevator? Don't leave. Don't leave. There's a third one. Find it. Um,
[10540.15s -> 10549.30s]  can you note down the two teleporters? Yeah, I went in both of them. One of them, they just travel
[10549.30s -> 10553.88s]  between each other. They just go one to the other. I'm probably going to delete that now in my notes.
[10554.60s -> 10568.09s]  I'll come back. I've done what I've done, what I've been able to see that I can really do.
[10568.81s -> 10573.10s]  The only exception is going back here and just taking one quick look around,
[10573.10s -> 10598.60s]  like here. Oh, not here. The next one. This one here. Because there's back here.
[10600.63s -> 10614.46s]  Wait, no. Where? No, that was correct. That was correct. Yeah, that was correct. Yeah, that was
[10614.46s -> 10625.99s]  correct. This is going to kill me. So back here is this thing, right? This is the kind of in-between
[10626.07s -> 10637.70s]  area where I came from. Can I go and check really quick? Because that's the elevator.
[10638.58s -> 10654.31s]  Elevator there. What does your stream title mean? Um, I don't know. No, okay. I'll go back up.
[10656.15s -> 10661.18s]  You get your item scaling. Like I have an A scaling with matcha powder. It's just like,
[10661.18s -> 10664.46s]  it's doing so much for me and it's making my game. It's making me feel like so much better.
[10664.46s -> 10674.49s]  I think my gameplay so much better. I'm going back down. Whatever. Just get off. Get off. Get
[10674.49s -> 10682.26s]  off. I don't want to. Okay. I'm an idiot. Yeah, this just takes you back to where I was the first
[10682.26s -> 10692.68s]  time. Yeah. Uh, I'm out. It was cool. I, if I need to come back, I will. So we're going to get out
[10692.68s -> 10702.94s]  and I'm going to go back to where I was here because I don't want to, I wanted to go this way
[10703.74s -> 10719.13s]  and that's when I got, this is that area there. Okay. I want to check what this is. Let's go here.
[10719.13s -> 10726.01s]  End of the stream. What? The stream is not turning off for at least at the very least,
[10728.30s -> 10744.76s]  like five or six hours. So you've got that wrong. Oh no, no, no, no, no. And I'm going to tell you,
[10744.76s -> 10750.44s]  I am going to take a break somewhere later tonight. Like probably in like a few hours,
[10750.44s -> 10754.76s]  a couple of hours, maybe I'm going to eat. Uh, so I'm going to eat something,
[10755.48s -> 10768.36s]  wherever that is, figure that out. Maybe I eat. And after that, where am I going? This way.
[10769.66s -> 10793.37s]  So I will be able to eat something. It won't be a 30 minute break. No, this way. That will give me
[10793.37s -> 10798.17s]  the energy to be able to stream for like probably another few hours. So I'll be good to go. God
[10798.17s -> 10811.38s]  dammit. I keep going on. Wait, there's one of those things. Uh, what? That's not that, that's
[10811.38s -> 10816.22s]  literally like not that far. Why are you talking about? There was no far at all.
[10816.78s -> 10834.94s]  I've survived other falls that were far more than that. I'm terrified to do that now. What? Um,
[10836.07s -> 10845.78s]  I'm terrified to do this. That kills me. Look at how short that is. It's a bug. Uh, no, no,
[10845.78s -> 10865.24s]  it's not. I'm sorry. I'm going down here. I'm terrified to do this. I swear to God, don't fall.
[10865.24s -> 10875.77s]  Hold on. Wait, what if I pick up the souls? Oh, they're not. Okay. We're good. All right.
[10875.77s -> 10883.00s]  How did I get over there last time? Like I'm just trying to go this way.
[10884.20s -> 10900.81s]  You're going to cross the river. That just teleported you. Oh, that's okay. Right.
[10900.81s -> 10922.34s]  Does this kill me? It does. I swear I jumped down here before. I swear to God. How did I get in
[10922.34s -> 10927.06s]  there before? I was down there before. Remember? I was like, oh, if you're looking for that blood
[10927.06s -> 10941.91s]  weapon, it's down here. Well, okay. We're going to find another way across the bridge. Jump later.
[10941.91s -> 10963.08s]  I don't think the double jump stops fatal fall damage. Weird guy in a Burger King costume comes
[10963.08s -> 10994.42s]  over and wrecks your campsite and kills you. I get his weapon. Hayden sell swords. Cool. What was
[10994.42s -> 11015.85s]  that? Strength and dex or it's a great sword. That's pretty cool. What's that? What's the weapon
[11015.85s -> 11041.22s]  art? Like a cool spin. Oh, very nice. Look at how powerful I am being back in Limgrave.
[11042.46s -> 11055.64s]  You have nothing on me. Is that another armored car? Unless that's the armored car that came all
[11055.64s -> 11068.10s]  the way down foot road. No, that's another armored car. Let's go waste the tree Sentinel. I beat
[11068.10s -> 11077.99s]  him a long time ago. That was the first boss I killed. Did I already get this or is this another
[11077.99s -> 11104.97s]  just armored car? Well, let's go. How do I get them to stop? Stop. Stop the vehicle. Stop the
[11104.97s -> 11136.33s]  vehicle. Stop the vehicle. Oh, shit. Here they come. Great acts. Bye. Look at this. Oh my God.
[11136.33s -> 11185.38s]  How many people? How about you? I'm so much stronger than them now. Shut up. You fucking idiot.
[11186.42s -> 11239.37s]  What was that guy doing? I can't. Why can't I? I don't have any mana. All right. Cool. I got a great
[11239.37s -> 11252.52s]  axe. I'm so powerful for this area now though. All right. I want to go right here because like,
[11252.52s -> 11269.51s]  what is this? It's kind of cool. It's over here. Waypoint ruins. Remember there are two items.
[11270.07s -> 11284.44s]  Left stick makes it so you dismount easier. I unbound my dismount because it's crouched
[11284.44s -> 11290.73s]  too and then ruins my video game experience. All right. It's probably like a mini boss down here.
[11290.73s -> 11312.22s]  Let's get it. Low stone. There's one in the front. There's an item in the front of the cart.
[11312.86s -> 11371.88s]  You're not going to tell me twice. Thanks for making me come all the way back here.
[11373.66s -> 11381.24s]  Nothing. Okay. I need a bonfire. I mean, I have enough to level up so I can be careful.
[11381.24s -> 11411.05s]  People call me Jimmy. You guys are full of weird baits today. Okay. Jimmy. Okay. Up there.
[11414.50s -> 11448.58s]  Fortnite. Fortnite. Jimmy. All right. I got a good view. Found it. Yeah, man. I got poisoned. I was
[11448.58s -> 11456.50s]  just trying to pick up the items and leave. There's definitely a bonfire down here. That's
[11456.50s -> 11466.98s]  just a boss. Shit. I need a bonfire over here somewhere. Oh, hi there, Jimmy. Oh, hey there,
[11466.98s -> 11483.99s]  Jimmy. Oh, hey there. Oh, hey, Jimmy. There's got to be a teleporter here. Well, I'll just mark it.
[11485.35s -> 11498.73s]  I'll level up anyways because I might die to boss. Oh, I'm turning around. There's going to be one
[11498.73s -> 11506.63s]  right here somewhere down the road. Just wait. There has to be one sitting on the side like
[11506.63s -> 11526.79s]  usually, right? Come on. I'm very far away from one. There's got to be one. Not like right here.
[11527.43s -> 11538.25s]  There's a little lake right at the edge. Why am I dying? Because I am currently poisoned. It has
[11538.25s -> 11552.17s]  to be. It's definitely not. It's just so far away. Can we get a look at me, please? Look at me.
[11553.21s -> 11570.65s]  All right. I have 20, which is where I want it to be. Rebalanced. I do need more endurance and we
[11570.65s -> 11577.42s]  need two more mind and I need to get to 20. 18 endurance, 20 mind, and then the rest is going
[11577.42s -> 11587.88s]  into intelligence and dexterity for the rest of the game. I'll keep it at eight heals. That's fine.
[11588.76s -> 11607.91s]  These sacred tears. Can I get 20 likes on this? 20 likes. I'm just smoking crack. Okay, back here.
[11607.91s -> 11631.99s]  I'm going to go in those ruins and fight the boss. Ooh, pretty tree. Something definitely over here
[11631.99s -> 11638.28s]  as well. Yeah, hold on. There's a lot of random shit. Look at all these ruins. Golden rune, golden
[11638.28s -> 11666.70s]  rune. Try to get them all. Oh, very cool. Something going on up there. What's your deal? What's your
[11666.70s -> 11684.06s]  deal? Wow. Look at that tower. All right, let's go down here and do whatever is happening in this
[11684.06s -> 11712.22s]  area. Let's see what's in here. I'm her boss. Let's go. Mad pumpkin head. Oh man, I am,
[11713.34s -> 11742.39s]  I am very leveled for you. Got a thousand souls. Holy shit. Imagine if I was like level two.
[11756.25s -> 11770.01s]  Ah, you're going to sneak this back here, huh? Hello. Okay. Um, the new NPC. Oh my God, we've,
[11771.54s -> 11783.93s]  my queen, I finally found you. How long has it been? Three, four, five years. My queen.
[11792.18s -> 11801.19s]  Sorcerer. The burger queen.
[11810.36s -> 11817.96s]  I was exiled from the academy of Rhea Lucaria as a reviled apostate witch. Witch. Do you still wish
[11817.96s -> 11833.70s]  to learn from me? Witch. Well, piece of work. I could be a warlock. You are now my protege in
[11833.70s -> 11841.88s]  glintstone sorcery, but I refuse to coddle or cast kind words. Never. Anticipate grievances,
[11842.52s -> 11855.11s]  young apprentice. Did you see what level I am? A lot. Okay. Enhances left-hand shield damage
[11855.11s -> 11865.46s]  negation. I already have this. Glintstone's stars. I have glintstone arc, glintstone barrage,
[11866.10s -> 11877.00s]  or glintstone's armament. Okay. I want a compilation for the amount of times that I've gone
[11877.88s -> 11883.88s]  like over here. Just like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I feel it's been
[11883.88s -> 11889.50s]  like 30 times. Can I actually put this on my weapon? Because this is a huge fucking deal
[11889.50s -> 11909.94s]  if I can. I think so. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Legs to walk.
[11910.82s -> 11919.22s]  So to become a sorcerer, first you must face your ignorance. Shall we start learning?
[11920.18s -> 11945.64s]  Yes, we shall in just a minute. Kill her. Why would I kill her when she's the only person that has
[11947.00s -> 11964.38s]  these moves? All right. The other one that I want. Crystal barrage or stars. Barrage sounds kind of
[11964.38s -> 11975.86s]  cool. Fires a volley of glintstone and crystal shards. Charging increases potency. Or fires three
[11975.86s -> 11980.10s]  magic shooting stars that pursue the target. The source can be cast while in motion and you can
[11980.10s -> 11996.55s]  charge it. Didn't the turtle sell this? I think the turtle already sells this. I don't think the
[11996.55s -> 12010.52s]  turtle has this one. He sold comets. Stars is garbage. I wonder how barrage, I wonder what that
[12010.52s -> 12018.63s]  is. I'll try barrage. I already have the other ones besides the shield. Go play with our new toys.
[12019.27s -> 12029.46s]  R1, R1, R1, R1. Goodbye. Thank you. That was cool. That was definitely worth stumbling upon.
[12030.18s -> 12043.80s]  Red glintstone, please. Okay, so here is magic weapon. So I have glintstone pebble, swift
[12043.80s -> 12057.94s]  glintstone shard, great glintstones shard, omit, which I can't use, barrage. All right, so I have
[12057.94s -> 12069.02s]  to leave this area. Okay, cool. Stars is good. Sorcery in the other From Software games is kind
[12069.50s -> 12079.48s]  of weird. It's a little it's a little odd. Some of the moves were just dog shit, just absolute
[12079.48s -> 12082.28s]  dog shit. And they scaled terribly. And it was like, why are they even in the game?
[12083.51s -> 12098.86s]  I don't know. I hope they actually are all these viable. Okay, that's kind of cool. Oh, my God,
[12098.86s -> 12119.54s]  what the fuck? This guy's dead. Sucks. Let's keep going this way. That's my destination.
[12120.18s -> 12128.79s]  But yeah, sorcery was always one of those weird things they put in all these games. Because
[12128.79s -> 12133.43s]  there's this like one move that scales and it's just unbelievable and has the right cast time
[12133.43s -> 12139.51s]  to be the best. But then they have like a dozen other of these like crystal barrage pebble stones
[12140.15s -> 12147.62s]  that they just like suck and they're just useless. PvE. Right? Because a lot of sorcery
[12147.62s -> 12168.02s]  is insane in PvP. Wrong way. Still alive. I'm going the wrong way. You're right.
[12175.56s -> 12183.98s]  Oh, Hayden armor. But yeah, sorcery. Some of those things are cool in PvP. And that's what
[12183.98s -> 12190.09s]  they're kind of maybe designed for. It does look like there's a lot more interesting spells.
[12190.81s -> 12198.97s]  At least what it looks like. At least maybe initially, I could be wrong. So we got to go
[12199.61s -> 12215.70s]  this way towards one. Hello. Oh, sapling sweet sapling of glorious gold. As your crystal teardrop
[12215.70s -> 12227.22s]  ripened. You look like an NPC from the PS2 Sopranos game. The only reason why I'm
[12227.22s -> 12232.60s]  addressing that comment is because I think I've seen that comment like 30 times in the last
[12232.60s -> 12240.50s]  four straight days. I keep seeing that comment. What do you want me to say? You want to be like,
[12240.50s -> 12254.60s]  yo, what the fuck did you say? Like, what do you want me to say? Maybe I'll run into something
[12254.60s -> 12297.62s]  else here. Don't. The Elden Ring. Yeah, the Elden Ring. The Elden Lord. Lord. Oh, nice.
[12307.86s -> 12314.04s]  I'm actually happy to find it. In the meantime, I'm going to do this.
[12316.66s -> 12331.86s]  I'm running out of mana. Let's try this. This is Crystal Barrage. It's kind of annoying. Can't do
[12331.86s -> 12349.30s]  it. Can't do it on this weapon. Oh, well. Do I have to be in combat? I don't think I do. I think
[12349.30s -> 12358.12s]  this is already a magic weapon, so they won't let me do it. Yep. Nope. It's like, sorry. Ready?
[12358.12s -> 12370.52s]  Let's see. Watch this. Sad. Sad. Because look at how it gets so blue and pretty. Sad. That's very
[12370.52s -> 12387.94s]  sad. Very, very sad. So I gotta put the other stuff back on. Greatsword is- I'm gonna keep the
[12387.94s -> 12393.22s]  Greatsword on it. It's been very useful. This has to come off in favor of Great Glenstone.
[12393.94s -> 12402.70s]  Because I want to give that a try. I haven't really played with it. That's really sad.
[12402.70s -> 12413.13s]  But this thing is really good. It's already infused. Wait, what? What happened to my- What
[12413.13s -> 12427.98s]  happened to my clothes? What happened? Korean Knight is still good. Does the armor do anything
[12427.98s -> 12443.88s]  for me? No. Aiden Armor is pretty good, too. Do any of these do anything for me? Probably not.
[12453.34s -> 12459.62s]  Red Maiden gauntlets are better. They're a lot heavier, though. They're just better.
[12470.55s -> 12476.97s]  Stupid horns off. I'm gonna have to wear this the whole game, I think.
[12483.26s -> 12490.84s]  Yeah. I'm gonna have to try that new shard. Let's go. On the horse. Going to this place over here.
[12491.88s -> 12502.01s]  Through the woods. Dude, look at the graphics on that rock. They were pretty good. All right,
[12502.01s -> 12510.54s]  new area. All right, this is like a little bear. Not as scary as the other one, but what's this?
[12520.95s -> 12531.61s]  You are quite susceptible. You're not as scary as your, uh, big brother. You're not as scary as
[12531.61s -> 12567.13s]  Mama Bear. All right, there's a huge one. Ah, Crown Slam. This is so awesome because you could
[12567.13s -> 12571.93s]  literally just come back here. You could just go this way instead of the way that I went
[12572.49s -> 12578.95s]  when you play for the first time. The new character. It doesn't matter. That's awesome
[12578.95s -> 12599.62s]  for colossal weapons. Yeah. Coming over there. Open for business. Ooh, he's open for business.
[12600.42s -> 12617.82s]  Let's check out this. See how the glint's done. It's really slow, but if it hits,
[12619.11s -> 12639.58s]  okay, it's not that big of a deal. That move is really not good at all, actually. It's not good
[12639.58s -> 12650.26s]  at all. It's actually pretty bad. All right, what is that? Because I'm about to go explore it.
[12652.18s -> 12658.18s]  Demi-humans wax Roth. Now their mother's been taken. Where are you, Lord Kenneth? The night
[12658.34s -> 12680.10s]  deviled by blood. He's in there. Let's go pay him a visit. Bring the burger queen some squirrels
[12680.10s -> 12692.07s]  to get the good stuff. I brought the scrolls to the turtle. Maybe that was a mistake. Yeah,
[12692.07s -> 12704.04s]  this thing kind of sucks. Now the sword takes the arc, takes place with the arc. Um, hole is okay.
[12704.92s -> 12724.60s]  Maybe just put starlight on just for fun. I mean, it's really pretty. I'll keep it. Whatever. I
[12724.60s -> 12728.20s]  really only use these two anyways for now, so I'll keep them on. The swift, uh, glintstone is
[12728.20s -> 12736.81s]  awesome because it just happens in one second. It's good at night too. It lights up the area.
[12736.81s -> 12751.02s]  What about the new summon? Oh, that's true. Put it on after this. Yeah, this is crazy because this
[12751.02s -> 12756.78s]  is definitely a lower, please tell me that's one of those tears. Oh, that's a golden seed.
[12758.06s -> 12762.90s]  All right, let's go be high level Andy and just fucking wipe this whole place apart.
[12763.78s -> 12786.14s]  Is he fighting? Why is he fighting them? Over level the Andy. Well, I'm, I mean, I'm coming
[12786.14s -> 12791.86s]  here for a very specific purpose. I just wanted to see what was over here. I also really needed
[12791.86s -> 12803.70s]  that. Hey, where's your leader? The only one that can give me a true challenge who runs this place
[12814.79s -> 12843.99s]  or hate. I feel like this thing's going to get up blood road for night. So this is where you watch
[12843.99s -> 12850.30s]  out for that explosion. That would actually kill me. All the things. Oh my God. Where was I?
[12850.94s -> 12861.35s]  Just stop. Yeah. You could tell how overleveled I am. I'm just seeing if they have any items in
[12861.35s -> 12867.83s]  this form. I'm just looking for like sacred tier shard things. I promise. I'm not like trying to
[12867.83s -> 12886.44s]  be like an idiot and just be like, look at, I'm just going to do the easy stuff. See, I don't even
[12886.44s -> 12910.95s]  care about that. You have to go to sacred places. Oh, this is a sacred place. You know, when swift
[12910.95s -> 12915.43s]  glint stone shard is killing things in one hit that you're going to embarrass this guy in front
[12915.43s -> 12958.20s]  of what? How many people here? 50,000 an asshole. That's actually not a joke. Imagine fighting this
[12958.20s -> 12992.84s]  guy at like level three, bloody slash and Godric night gauntlets. I'm going to say glasses. You can
[12992.84s -> 13002.73s]  probably get a sword. That sword is probably awesome. You see how cool that looks. Godric
[13002.73s -> 13007.53s]  night's glasses and just wearing them and just have disappeared glasses on. That would be so
[13007.53s -> 13021.72s]  funny. Oh my God. I LOLing so hard. There are two more Burger King masks. Maybe I'll find them
[13021.72s -> 13029.69s]  eventually. I'm looking for a very, okay. So here we go. This is like the end of the little dungeon.
[13035.24s -> 13040.62s]  Dectis medallion left. They're going to pull some resident evil shit here.
[13041.18s -> 13055.61s]  Join medallions to operate grand lift of Dectis. The right half is said to reside in Fort Faroth
[13055.61s -> 13076.89s]  in the dragon barrow far to the east. Like over here, dragon barrow far to the east is okay.
[13077.37s -> 13132.14s]  Okay, looks good. But I'm actually kind of glad I got that. Cool. So now I wonder, is it time to
[13132.14s -> 13138.71s]  start to progress through here? I mean, it's pointing me here, right? Like this is, I think
[13138.71s -> 13144.81s]  I can handle this impassable gray bridge. It wants me to go this way or it wants me to go up here,
[13145.37s -> 13161.78s]  like in this area. Or it wants me to go, is that dragon, you know what, let's go kill that dragon.
[13162.50s -> 13178.52s]  Yeah, let's go get that motherfucker right now. You should break a Sega Dreamcast over your head.
[13178.52s -> 13192.10s]  Okay, great idea. There's a ton of content in the academy that you missed. Yeah, I'm, but I mean,
[13192.82s -> 13203.98s]  I'm just kind of browsing around. I got eight flasks. I have a lot, I have more health now
[13204.86s -> 13212.44s]  and I'm going to put on the magic defense shit. I can have most of it on already. Magic defense.
[13213.66s -> 13225.40s]  Carrying gloves, cloth trousers, weirdly enough. Okay, this has got good magic defense. All right,
[13225.40s -> 13236.14s]  what about this thing? Magic brass shield, but I can't wear it this one here. Okay, I'm ready to
[13236.14s -> 13250.81s]  fight the dragon marked at number one. Where'd you find the medallion? Please, I need it.
[13253.38s -> 13259.78s]  That medallion, that east, that left part of the medallion is in Fort Haight, which is down here
[13259.78s -> 13265.30s]  all the way on like this little tail end here. Actually, literally right next to,
[13266.58s -> 13272.42s]  right, barely to the east of the lake, Fort Haight.
[13297.98s -> 13316.26s]  Sorry, I didn't, I didn't do this. Game fucking A's me. All right, let's do it. It's time. I
[13316.26s -> 13326.14s]  actually need to go upgrade this weapon too. I think I got a somber stone. Let's see. This is
[13326.14s -> 13333.51s]  a fight of just patience and just attacking only when you need to. Hope I don't get one shot by
[13333.51s -> 13337.43s]  something, but you know, I'm prepared. Got the boys if I need to call on them, which I don't
[13337.43s -> 13350.20s]  think I will. Let's go get this guy. I can probably get a few hits on him while he's lying down,
[13350.20s -> 13376.33s]  which is exactly what I'm going to try to do. I like just, I like missed like 40% of those hits.
[13377.13s -> 13423.77s]  Don't land on me. Doing, it's three hits. One, two, three, and that's it. Getting close. One, two,
[13423.77s -> 13460.90s]  one is fine. Hey, fuck out of the way. I just hit my head on the ceiling. Cookie bug ambush. Yeah,
[13460.90s -> 13469.78s]  what was that? I don't know why my brain was just like, wait, that's an item bug, but it's not.
[13469.78s -> 13477.82s]  Those guys just hang out there. It's probably a closer, uh, bonfire here somewhere too, right?
[13478.46s -> 13487.69s]  I thought this was a 1440p gamer. I am. I just don't stream in 1440p. I stream in 864p.
[13488.49s -> 13508.04s]  Not 1080. I'm not basking. All right. Well, that was dumb, but you know, we're going to go
[13508.04s -> 13527.70s]  forward again. I can use my shield as a weapon. Okay. This time don't miss every single time.
[13527.70s -> 13572.17s]  Just stand right next to his leg and do it. I didn't jump over. All right. We got to,
[13572.17s -> 13577.80s]  I was gonna say, we got to get away with this gigantic stone slab that's in the fucking way.
[13577.80s -> 13601.56s]  Hey, I got to just run away. Just after I aggro the guy, just run the fuck away.
[13601.56s -> 13606.84s]  Just get them away from all the debris and fucking rocks formation. Shit. That's a scattered run.
[13607.64s -> 13614.07s]  That's just bring them out. So we don't end up going like this.
[13622.68s -> 13636.90s]  Find a closer bonfire. Actually, that's not a bad idea. He's really strong against magic. Yeah.
[13636.90s -> 13646.57s]  He's an anti me. What the I should be killing him so much more swiftly. Okay. I'm not, let me
[13646.57s -> 13650.41s]  just see what, is there a little fire over here or something? Let's not go for him yet.
[13653.34s -> 13691.19s]  There's maybe there is like a fire. What's this? I'm going in here. What's this? Academy crystal
[13691.19s -> 13703.05s]  cave. Academy crystal cave is what it just said. And look at how much closer this is.
[13704.09s -> 13735.26s]  Okay. Summoning stone thing. I'm glad I have the starlight. It seems to be pretty helpful here.
[13741.85s -> 13747.00s]  Abe Moss, crystal cave moss. Oh, I don't like that. Give it back.
[13761.13s -> 13765.85s]  What the fuck? Why? How? I'm not sneaky. I'm a gigantic beacon of light.
[13766.82s -> 13777.72s]  There's so many people here. I'm a blip on their mini map right now. This is, oh God. Okay.
[13786.84s -> 13788.60s]  Shit. They all aggroed. Nope. Not all of them.
[13820.50s -> 13827.59s]  I look like one of you, but I'm not in the darkness. We all look alike. Don't we with our
[13827.59s -> 13844.84s]  masks? They couldn't tell the difference. The imposter. Okay. So there's something over here.
[13844.84s -> 13871.99s]  Look who glint's done. What else we got? There's definitely more. Very interested in what's at the
[13871.99s -> 13901.88s]  end of this thesis. That doesn't have to be in the head. Fireflies. Dude, I came in here with the
[13901.88s -> 13908.60s]  required item. Imagine coming down here without sorcery and without starlight. That'd be a living
[13908.60s -> 13931.16s]  hell. You just get a lantern or a torch. Don't diminish my cool character. That replaces one
[13931.16s -> 13958.38s]  of them, right? Okay. So that's that. There's that way. Can I do anything up here? Oh, skeletons.
[13967.94s -> 14000.60s]  Game is really, really loading something heavily. So I want to do a magician fight. That's fine.
[14002.60s -> 14018.18s]  Oh, maybe I'll get that one. I might get that move. Double motherfuckers. I'm out of here.
[14018.18s -> 14074.71s]  What did you bring the manna? Oh my God. He's got a magic hammer. Oh, please give me the magic
[14074.71s -> 14085.50s]  hammer. He's got this huge hammer. That's so cool. All right. Let's check and see what he was
[14085.50s -> 14104.74s]  guarding. There's a boss in there too. Oh man. It's gonna be rough. Excuse me. Where are you?
[14113.78s -> 14148.36s]  Pre-fire me. There's two chests here. Boost crystal sorcery, which I don't like. Is the sword
[14148.36s -> 14166.30s]  technically crystal? I think the sword is a crystal sorcery. Or is it glintstone? 48 intelligence to
[14166.30s -> 14177.54s]  put it on. I only have glintstones right now. Crystal ballot barrage. But the great sword thing
[14177.54s -> 14184.15s]  that I swing. Eat cereal or soup tonight? I'll probably tell you soup because soup sounds a
[14184.15s -> 14190.63s]  little more like healthy and like more nutrient based than like Captain Crunch. So I would say
[14190.63s -> 14207.11s]  that you probably have soup tonight. Okay, there's enough chests in here too. And a runic. Well,
[14209.13s -> 14212.41s]  unless there's a bonfire here, I'm gonna have to just go in here and see if I can do it.
[14213.21s -> 14227.50s]  This is about 5,000 souls though. Maybe I should just run through it. What do you think? Buy to
[14227.50s -> 14238.82s]  5,000 souls. Yeah. No, it's not worth it. Unless do I have? Hmm. I don't know. Only 5k. I can always
[14238.82s -> 14246.36s]  go get it again. All right, let's go. I'm gonna go for it. 5k is not that much right now. It's two
[14246.36s -> 14260.33s]  people. Oh, it's these two. I remember these guys. 13 fucking damage. That's it. Oh, I'm doing this
[14260.33s -> 14287.98s]  wrong. I need to hit them with something else. I wonder how I'm supposed to hurt them. Oh my god,
[14287.98s -> 14310.04s]  this guy's so annoying. Fucking R1 spamming piece of shit. Do I like end up breaking their crystals
[14311.16s -> 14318.46s]  stuff? I don't know what the fuck he's doing. Oh my god, his fucking friend is so annoying.
[14321.90s -> 14325.50s]  No, this is wrong, dude. I gotta like, I gotta attack him with something else.
[14326.38s -> 14334.79s]  I would call the boys and I don't, I can't. Do I have any? What else can I hit them with?
[14334.79s -> 14341.67s]  They made it a crystals. Maybe I should use like fire or something. Yeah, I remember these guys.
[14342.31s -> 14362.92s]  All right, we're gonna break. I got it. I got it. We're gonna get those souls back. I think you just
[14362.92s -> 14369.26s]  have to, you probably have to hit them enough times to shatter them, right? That makes sense.
[14369.26s -> 14378.47s]  Oh man, this is far. Okay. Well, just gonna run. I got the boys on standby. Fucking idiot.
[14386.71s -> 14403.94s]  Strike damage. I have slash pierce, standard pierce, pierce, pierce slash strike. I mean,
[14403.94s -> 14409.62s]  the flail is a piece of crap, but it's strike. Maybe that'll break it. I mean, this thing sucks,
[14409.62s -> 14414.82s]  but whatever. I'm not looking to do anything fancy. Will this, will like a, will it break
[14414.82s -> 14422.42s]  their armor? Maybe it will. I'll try it. I don't think I have a blunt weapon that, um,
[14423.22s -> 14436.17s]  I don't have a blunt weapon. I got rid of all of them. I have a strategy. Strategy is just kite
[14436.17s -> 14449.16s]  the guy, the guy that's like, just R1 spamming and file. I don't know what the fuck I am right
[14449.16s -> 14454.73s]  now. So we're going to have to figure that out real quick. Okay. So let's go this way.
[14458.26s -> 14493.62s]  Is that big guy? This huge guy's here. Run around. All right, let's go boys. All right.
[14493.94s -> 14503.88s]  Drag him across the whole thing because he's really slow. Okay. Now I'm stuck on a fucking
[14503.88s -> 14546.25s]  rock. I was stuck in the rock. There we go. All right. Let's job boys. They're dead. Same
[14546.25s -> 14551.37s]  strategy. Pull them all the way back. Oh, what? What's that? Oh, I think I can't even get rid of
[14551.37s -> 14574.17s]  it. Come on, hurry up. I might, I'm just kill this guy first. Just line aside him by the,
[14574.17s -> 14609.42s]  with a statue. I'm trying to time to dodge on you. Oh my goodness gracious. Get him please.
[14609.42s -> 14656.30s]  R1. You fucking annoying little shit. Get down. Oh my God. All right. It's going to work. It's
[14656.30s -> 14675.85s]  going to work. Oh, this run back is such a pain in the absolute fucking Dick. I swear to God.
[14680.82s -> 14686.76s]  That strategy worked. I have to just get in there and just wail and chant the flail.
[14686.76s -> 14695.70s]  Does it work on weapons like this? I thought it only worked on like
[14696.26s -> 14718.18s]  swords. Does it, it actually works on flail? Okay. All right. Let's sit on. Oh, where is it?
[14723.21s -> 14738.02s]  Someone's an ancestral follower. I can't summon Oleg. Do I have enough to summon him? How much
[14738.02s -> 14751.27s]  FP do I have? Okay. Yeah. Let's try this guy. All right. Let's do it. I didn't even want to press
[14751.27s -> 14764.28s]  that button twice. I just like, there's just so many buttons. Get up. He hates the boys.
[14764.92s -> 14777.75s]  You can try parrying too. That guy is really predictable. I'm always afraid to parry boss
[14777.75s -> 14781.22s]  because I feel like half the time it just doesn't do anything. But those aren't,
[14781.22s -> 14787.00s]  those are not even bosses. It's just like those crystal people that were outside.
[14792.62s -> 14797.99s]  Like I went the wrong fucking way, but it doesn't like, like running through the shit sucks.
[14798.07s -> 14821.72s]  Asshole. 5k gone, but it'll fucking just really matter. It's to the right, not to the left. How's
[14821.72s -> 14849.21s]  the pain? Uh, well the game is annoying sometimes, right? That's just the way it is. Okay.
[14850.65s -> 14859.91s]  The help of the game didn't hang for three seconds when I turned the fucking corner.
[14864.14s -> 14887.37s]  I don't have enough man to summon my friend. It's a wash. What the fuck is that move? I can't
[14887.37s -> 14896.63s]  parry with the shield. Oh, it's cause I, the weapon art with the flail. Okay. So I can't do
[14896.63s -> 14901.42s]  both because otherwise I can't summon the guy. I was trying to parry, but I have,
[14901.42s -> 14921.90s]  I have the magic defense shield on. Okay. So I can't do both. I have to, unless I want to
[14921.90s -> 14936.62s]  bring mana potions, which I'll bring one mana potion. I want to try to parry this guy. Okay.
[14936.62s -> 14956.50s]  So let's go for this fucking horse shit. The red shirts fueling his anger. This run back is awful
[14956.50s -> 14962.34s]  though, because all it takes is just one little, like dinky little bullet to hit you in the back.
[14963.06s -> 14972.02s]  And that's it. And you're going to just say exactly what I'm saying. I'm just saying,
[14978.57s -> 14983.93s]  motherfuckers. Hold on a second. The game has to like load the shaders for 15 straight seconds.
[14983.93s -> 15018.50s]  Okay. Now we can play. Let's go. Oh, he's got a bow. He's just one damage. What? He sucks.
[15019.06s -> 15030.15s]  He did one damage. Oh my God. Why did you tell me to bring this guy? Why did you tell me to bring
[15030.15s -> 15058.26s]  him? One damage. All right. It's time to parry this fuck face. You can't parry. You can, you can,
[15058.26s -> 15062.90s]  you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can. Okay. Just keep doing that.
[15062.90s -> 15077.10s]  Keep doing it. We're good. We're good. Not good. Fucking piece of shit with your spam.
[15088.44s -> 15090.84s]  Needs to be leveled up for something, man, because that's bad.
[15102.23s -> 15110.25s]  No, you are not hitting me with all of those. What the fuck? I just want to grab these guys by
[15110.25s -> 15116.52s]  their fucking heads. It's like three stooges. I just shatter both their brains and their heads.
[15117.08s -> 15121.10s]  Like, why can't I just grab them by their heads and just three stooges crush their heads?
[15122.70s -> 15131.08s]  Oh shit, Atriarch, what's up? Welcome, raiders. Currently dealing with a, dealing with a little
[15131.08s -> 15137.99s]  bit of a problem here. Thanks for the raid, Atriarch. I've got these two crystal idiots
[15137.99s -> 15142.71s]  down here and I'm having some trouble. Chat told me to summon this guy with the horns.
[15142.71s -> 15147.59s]  The guy did literally one damage. I wish I was making that up. I summoned him, took a whole
[15147.59s -> 15154.71s]  mana bar. He did one damage, one damage point. And then they ate him alive. So we're going to change
[15154.71s -> 15160.63s]  it up. We're going to go back to the boys. No, we're not. I'll tell you what we're doing.
[15161.35s -> 15173.64s]  Bringing in the dogs. The dogs are vicious. Go. I saw you've been playing it too and hopefully
[15173.64s -> 15179.74s]  you're doing okay. You caught me right in the middle of a, I'm a little upset. Try to calm down.
[15180.38s -> 15183.74s]  I'm going to try to get this to work. So let's, let's go ahead and get started.
[15183.74s -> 15194.12s]  Okay. Everything's fine. I have to level these people up. Like I can't just have them at level
[15194.12s -> 15198.44s]  one. Although, uh, all right, I'm going to get it this time because I'm going to just,
[15199.08s -> 15213.67s]  here we go. Everything is not cool. Everything is going to be just fine. I promise.
[15242.97s -> 15253.14s]  Everything's going to be just fine. And I can tell you right now,
[15254.41s -> 15295.43s]  there's no reason everybody's freaked out. You, no, you hesitated. Can't bring it back out.
[15302.95s -> 15305.99s]  Why is he doing a different move? You've been doing the same move the whole time.
[15306.95s -> 15322.44s]  He decides to change instead of going, he goes like, what was this new move set? Try guard
[15322.44s -> 15328.42s]  parrying? No, guard parry is not going to be a good idea. Cause guard parry, the caster guy
[15329.22s -> 15334.42s]  throws his fucking goddamn fruity pebbles at me from across the room. And I'm vulnerable.
[15334.42s -> 15347.27s]  If I do a guard parry, I have to go. Okay. I'm going to kill these guys. These guys are
[15347.27s -> 15357.45s]  not even that big of a deal. They're really not. It's going to come down to parry. Get them run.
[15359.32s -> 15369.24s]  Run, parry, get them, run, airy, run, get them. And don't get hit by like the 30 people in here
[15369.24s -> 15375.48s]  that cast the same fucking spell at you like that. He's still shooting it. He's shooting it at me.
[15375.48s -> 15378.76s]  He's still shooting it. I don't know which, which direction he's shooting it, but he's doing it.
[15379.64s -> 15386.81s]  It's going to have to be, it's going to have to be, I got to bring the boys out either that,
[15386.81s -> 15389.93s]  or we're going to try the other. Cause the boys are just annoying. They just get all over the place.
[15391.16s -> 15399.06s]  I'm going to upgrade the boys. The boys are annoying, right? They're annoying.
[15401.69s -> 15403.61s]  They just walk around and bump into walls and shit.
[15404.41s -> 15448.39s]  Aurene, get it off before this idiot does anything. You fuck. All right. Get away, get away,
[15448.39s -> 15450.39s]  get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away. Wait till he does the
[15456.78s -> 15487.37s]  line of sight with the statues. That's the plan right now. Check this out. Strategy. Excuse me.
[15488.01s -> 15555.16s]  I tried to lock on, but I couldn't. It's broken. Okay. All right. Just have to run. Fuck that rock.
[15575.69s -> 15616.02s]  Wow. Jeez. Ow, ow, ow. Slow down. Don't let him do anything else. Oh yeah.
[15621.88s -> 15633.56s]  Crystal release. Nice. I'm telling you the strategy, the strategy was you got a line of sight
[15633.56s -> 15640.78s]  with the first guy. I lost 5,000 souls and I'm not happy about it. I'm very upset about it.
[15646.07s -> 15659.24s]  What is this? Oh, nice. Holy shit. I was on camera. You got to see what it looked like.
[15659.80s -> 15678.04s]  That's just... Where does this go? Crystal release.
[15678.84s -> 15683.08s]  Where it's a massive crystal then shadows it to scour a wide area with a violent rain.
[15683.72s -> 15689.24s]  So is that the thing where it was just around me? Just... I want to try it.
[15694.87s -> 15716.39s]  Uh, it's an exit dungeon, but hold on. Where does this go? Shinema shield.
[15719.14s -> 15731.16s]  That's actually pretty funny. That was a good call though to take that off.
[15731.72s -> 15761.05s]  Academy of... Wait, what? What the fuck? I'm back at the academy. Hold the lever.
[15761.69s -> 15772.49s]  This is a different area of the academy. Uh, I can't. Soggy or crunchy cereal, bro? Please.
[15772.49s -> 15777.46s]  Why would you ever eat cereal, soggy? You guys are eating cereal wrong by the way. Let me tell
[15777.46s -> 15787.40s]  you how to fix it. So you only eat, only eat for a little bit of cereal in and a little bit of milk.
[15788.12s -> 15793.24s]  You eat that first. Don't like dump, people dump like three or four cups of fucking cereal,
[15793.24s -> 15799.56s]  just mass cereal in their bowl. And then they just, you just dump milk in there and then it
[15799.56s -> 15804.76s]  becomes a mess. Sometimes you don't even eat all of it. You do like half a cup of cereal and then
[15804.76s -> 15809.24s]  like a little bit, like a quarter cup of milk, half a cup of milk. Eat that. It's going to be
[15809.24s -> 15813.48s]  crunchy and perfect. Then just do a little bit more. Pour a little bit more in the bowl,
[15813.48s -> 15815.64s]  a little bit more milk. I don't know how people keep getting this wrong.
[15816.52s -> 15837.77s]  What is, this is just like a secret chest. Terra Magicus. Terra Magicus. Raises the magic
[15837.77s -> 15852.18s]  strength of those within the sigil. What? I don't get it. This is just like a buff. Okay,
[15852.18s -> 15856.34s]  this is a glintstone. Draws an academy sigil upon the ground, raising the magic strength of those
[15856.34s -> 15865.32s]  within it. So I put a sigil on the ground and then I can just bam. It's an, it's a buff. Okay,
[15865.32s -> 15878.47s]  that's pretty cool. Hell yeah. Nice. Nice. All right. Awesome. You yell a little less. Uh,
[15878.47s -> 15895.02s]  I don't think that's going to happen. I'm sorry, man. Talk to the sorcerer about the gate key with
[15895.02s -> 15901.29s]  the new opening. Uh, I do have to go talk to that guy, but I can't give it to him. Maybe he'll tell
[15901.29s -> 15914.81s]  me where another one is. Fast travel from here. Uh, yeah. Let, let me go talk to him. So he says,
[15915.53s -> 15925.03s]  this, this is right. Yeah, it's right here. Where is it? Yeah. Church, the church of
[15925.19s -> 15945.75s]  fear. It's right there. All right. Oh, all right. These are great runs. I gotta go. I don't,
[15945.75s -> 15955.45s]  I don't, I don't, I don't know what those are. Is this the right place? No, it's this church,
[15955.45s -> 15979.43s]  right? You got them from the boss. Yeah, that's right. Are you going to start vaping? Uh, I,
[15979.43s -> 15990.92s]  I'm not going to start vaping. I'm the person up on the second. I can't give it to him. What if I,
[15990.92s -> 15997.70s]  am I going to screw everything up here if I give this to him? He said I can't give it to anybody.
[16004.09s -> 16007.99s]  I don't know what happens if I do it. I'm kind of scared.
[16009.59s -> 16014.31s]  So you found yourself a blintstone key, but I certainly can't take it from you.
[16014.31s -> 16018.47s]  That key belongs to you. By rights, you should use it for yourself. It's true.
[16019.35s -> 16023.99s]  I wish to return to my place of study, but that's no excuse to impose upon others.
[16025.59s -> 16031.83s]  Is this why Bluntstones always finish last? Okay. So where's another one? Head to the academy of
[16031.83s -> 16035.43s]  real. Carry on with your journey. Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake.
[16035.43s -> 16042.50s]  Dude, is there another one in the, in the second? There's a second key in the academy.
[16043.46s -> 16065.98s]  I just go get it. Academy grand library and Academy gate. I mean, there's, I don't know
[16065.98s -> 16080.09s]  where to start. Would it be somewhere in here? Eight parlors, schoolhouse. It looks like the
[16080.09s -> 16084.33s]  only place I really haven't been is here. So I'm going to go to like the church and go backwards
[16084.97s -> 16101.54s]  this way. I was going to put a marker here and just whatever. Uh, why do you hate crack?
[16101.78s -> 16111.88s]  People keep saying you need to use your great runs. I have to go to the place where I can use
[16111.88s -> 16120.81s]  them. It's like the tower, right? There's a tower that I haven't gone to yet. That I don't know.
[16120.81s -> 16129.93s]  Like, is it over here? I take it to a tower. I'm imagining this is the tower. If I were to take a
[16129.93s -> 16142.49s]  guess, I will go do that afterwards. All right. So now the play is to try to go this way. I think
[16142.81s -> 16152.34s]  I think, see if I can, can I get in there from here? I don't know if I can get over here from
[16152.34s -> 16176.60s]  there. Hmm. There's another section in this academy. Maybe from here. Okay. Let's try this.
[16178.57s -> 16184.71s]  I head over here. This is where those, um, water wheel is.
[16187.88s -> 16194.58s]  Which I need to be this way. So it looks like there's a path here somewhere. Hold on.
[16194.58s -> 16204.47s]  Out this again. No, I'm not doing the water wheel. I got to find a way over this way.
[16205.03s -> 16220.14s]  I'm here. I'm just going to run. It's like, I've already done this like five times.
[16231.18s -> 16238.22s]  I know. I'll clear this because this pot, the big pots there is this area. This is where I fought
[16238.22s -> 16248.74s]  the boss. Is there another way to keep going from the boss's chamber? But I didn't see.
[16249.46s -> 16265.35s]  If there was that way. Remember, what if you were like my dentist? Okay. So I remember this.
[16266.15s -> 16298.20s]  Was there another way to go that way? Spam age isn't fun. Maybe annoying. Yeah. Okay. Wait,
[16298.20s -> 16300.97s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[16300.97s -> 16311.26s]  over there. Like that way. I've been there. I don't think I've been there yet.
[16311.82s -> 16334.92s]  All right. You've kind of making this a real pain in the ass for me right now.
[16334.92s -> 16355.30s]  Can't just cheese you. Oh my God. Fuck all of you. Okay. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's
[16355.30s -> 16358.18s]  right. That's right. That's right. I didn't go. I remember I looked over here and I was like,
[16358.18s -> 16365.75s]  oh yeah, yeah, I didn't do it. Okay. Here we go. That's right. I did look over here and I said,
[16365.75s -> 16372.66s]  well, maybe later. The thing with from software games is maybe later means never again. I will
[16372.66s -> 16389.94s]  never look at this part of the game ever again. So you're right. Let's go. Ouch. Oh, it's him.
[16390.58s -> 16408.55s]  I got bad sorceries on for this. It's going to go weapons. We're just going to go with the two
[16408.55s -> 16426.87s]  handed. All right. That's that way. Cool. The POG, the POG champ, IRL pony ride stream waiting room.
[16434.30s -> 16437.74s]  It would be the most, that would be one of the most boring streams you probably would ever see
[16437.74s -> 16449.35s]  here. Just riding a pony. I imagine with a GoPro here, just looking down, just never so often just
[16449.35s -> 16484.50s]  hear like, then like the big horse sneezes, like somebody under that and check. Oh, they're
[16484.50s -> 16496.31s]  acts. Yeah, I see. Okay. Good try. Good try. I can't really cast any spells. So we're going
[16496.31s -> 16512.01s]  to have to do this. I didn't think you were going to attack. Nice try. Pull them each.
[16515.54s -> 16526.82s]  What the fuck is that move? I want it. Oh shit. This is bad. That's not what I wanted to have
[16526.82s -> 16562.84s]  happen at all. It's coming. Damn it. And cage. Oh, everything is fine. I went, I just got so slumped
[16562.84s -> 16593.85s]  down. I was like, this sucks. We're good though. And yeah, progress. Let's go. I wonder if I ring
[16593.85s -> 16606.17s]  that bell. All these rooftops. It might be another boss up here too. That'd be cool. Meteor bolt.
[16607.61s -> 16627.06s]  Oh, cool. That's cool. That's cool. What is that? Cool. It's like we're jumping. Are you mocking
[16627.06s -> 16651.94s]  yourself? Um, I don't know. I hope this doesn't hurt. Right to my marker. Perfect. Exactly where
[16651.94s -> 16698.31s]  I wanted to go. There's no way I make that jump. It's being thorough. I could go here. That guy is
[16698.31s -> 16702.49s]  scary looking. I wish I had a sorcerer to kill him with, but I don't. And he's gonna, Oh God,
[16702.49s -> 16709.00s]  this is bad. All right. Oh, it's just an archer. All right. Nevermind.
[16712.73s -> 16720.97s]  That over there. Um, I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna have to go all the way back around and back up,
[16720.97s -> 16731.03s]  but that's an item that I want. Imbued sword key. That's different. What is an imbued sword key?
[16731.59s -> 16755.53s]  I'll check it. What the fuck? Oh shit. Uh, there's a lot of places I can go. I
[16756.49s -> 16765.59s]  I'm gonna go back over here. Did you take a break? Uh, yeah, I did already. I'm gonna take a food
[16765.59s -> 16776.01s]  break here. Maybe later. You check around every single building because they put stuff everywhere.
[16777.75s -> 16784.12s]  You never know when you're going to find a something that you, uh, need. All right. Do I
[16784.12s -> 16807.82s]  go down the ladder or do I just jump over the rooftops? I'm marking it. Oh fuck. I wonder if
[16807.82s -> 16845.14s]  there's another boss. That bait was so annoying and I'm in trouble now. I can go down here,
[16845.94s -> 16854.02s]  which leads to, I've already been here, but have I been? No, I don't know. Have I been at that level
[16854.02s -> 16859.94s]  of the roof? I'm not going to go down yet because there's an area to go this way too.
[16861.69s -> 16877.82s]  What the fuck was that? I have no health. This is bad. Oh, I remember looking up here,
[16879.30s -> 16905.27s]  seeing that. Is that a lie? It might be. That was such an ugly face. I hate that one.
[16905.99s -> 16922.31s]  That was like, I, I did not like that one. I got a key after all that. I still kind of want to.
[16923.03s -> 16934.46s]  There's the main is the, where was it? Where was it? Where was it? I keep forgetting here.
[16934.46s -> 16938.73s]  Where's the court? How was the courtroom? Cause I want to go back up there.
[16939.21s -> 16947.16s]  It's a classroom and you run through and then the courtroom courthouse is like here,
[16947.96s -> 16969.86s]  courtyard. Hey, I've been up here. I haven't even been up here.
[16974.14s -> 16982.10s]  Luzuli glint stone sword. That's different. Oh shit. I gotta be careful. Get the item.
[16983.30s -> 17012.76s]  Shattering crystal. Yeah. Right. What was the last one? One, two, three, four.
[17021.35s -> 17033.34s]  I kicked the ladder down. Oh my goodness gracious. You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[17033.34s -> 17035.02s]  Hell yeah. This is definitely leads to something.
[17041.00s -> 17062.70s]  Fuck. And that's how unfair was that? He can't, I, he wasn't, we won't back up.
[17063.42s -> 17069.62s]  I try to hit him, a bump into him, slash him and he just, what? All right. Where is the,
[17069.62s -> 17077.24s]  where the fuck is that? I just knocked a ladder down. Where's that ladder? I don't,
[17077.24s -> 17087.94s]  I don't know where I am. The room where you just came from, but where first grace.
[17091.22s -> 17101.13s]  Uh, where was that? This one here, bait parlor.
[17103.29s -> 17121.32s]  I'll get your spells. Oh, you're right. Okay. Let me change my spells. That cannot stay on.
[17121.32s -> 17125.32s]  I'm going to go back to swift glint stone. We're going to change this to,
[17127.54s -> 17135.02s]  and that need more intelligence. Let's do the, the pole pole is pretty good.
[17138.15s -> 17144.70s]  All right. So I can see where I died on the map. Oh fuck. That's in the church.
[17145.96s -> 17199.67s]  I died like over here. You please read. I'm your biological son. I just found your channel.
[17200.39s -> 17213.53s]  That'd be, that'd be weird. I don't think so. I'm your biological son. I just found your channel.
[17214.49s -> 17241.34s]  That's so stupid. Yeah. Air, air to the German empire. Okay. So now that I did that, let's
[17241.34s -> 17250.06s]  browse around. You just have, you just don't give a shit at all. Do you?
[17251.02s -> 17274.79s]  You still got it off. I don't think so. Ooh, I think I already have one of those
[17275.43s -> 17295.37s]  germ of his empire. Does this do anything for me? Not really. This one just has more armor.
[17295.37s -> 17299.78s]  This one's better. Are you looking for the whopper secret formula?
[17302.70s -> 17321.18s]  That was actually a pretty good one. All right. So that what's in you.
[17322.06s -> 17338.38s]  When sage glintstone crown, what greatly increases intelligence to the detriment of HP and stamina.
[17344.41s -> 17351.34s]  Oh, I don't want to wear this. This looks awful. It's a double whopper.
[17351.98s -> 17361.83s]  28, 29, 30, 30 is three intelligence really worth losing like almost a hundred in
[17361.83s -> 17375.13s]  HP? I don't know. I don't think so. I really don't. I really don't think so. I got the new
[17375.13s -> 17389.26s]  sword. Oh yeah, that's right. Not as good. Not as good as this scales E with the decks
[17395.22s -> 17399.86s]  deals magic damage. Apparently once you use the staff sorcery, it's got glintstone pebble,
[17400.58s -> 17409.91s]  but I already have that. I already, I already own it. Fuck stats, make a cute outfit,
[17414.33s -> 17420.46s]  make a cute outfit. How many big bosses have you beat? I've done. Okay.
[17421.69s -> 17425.29s]  Uh, how many, actually I, this is a good time to think about this for a second.
[17425.85s -> 17443.40s]  How many bosses have I beaten the game so far? How many like eight, nine and two main? I know
[17443.40s -> 17456.22s]  there's definitely been three or four main. I mean, you need to see this. Uh, I, I see it right now
[17456.22s -> 17464.42s]  and I have, I do and I don't want to show that on stream. It's fucking, I hate it. It's, it's scary.
[17468.52s -> 17474.52s]  This is scary. It looks like my jaw is like unhinged and shit. I don't know. I'm not showing
[17474.52s -> 17484.20s]  that. I'm the streamer. I get to the site. No, it's fucking horrifying. I hate every,
[17484.20s -> 17490.63s]  because you took my real teeth. Are those my real teeth that you just like photoshopped in?
[17494.60s -> 17497.16s]  All right. Maybe that is worth showing on stream because I'm actually really curious.
[17499.91s -> 17510.50s]  Oh, I, this is awful. It looks like a horror game or something. I fucking hate this. This
[17510.50s -> 17538.97s]  is looks scary. It looks like a horror game. Why can't I show? Where is it? I just saved it.
[17539.53s -> 17549.50s]  It's possessed. All right. Well, that's weird. How come I can't show this?
[17550.14s -> 17556.78s]  Oh, I got an, I have an idea. My computer is fucking weird, man. I swear to God.
[17557.58s -> 17575.53s]  Where is it? I just saved it. This doesn't make any sense. It's like there's no images that I have.
[17576.65s -> 17583.56s]  Apparently zero images are on my desktop. What the fuck are you talking about?
[17583.56s -> 17607.56s]  Oh, so my real teeth, I think. Are they? Did you take? No, you didn't. Did you? What did you get
[17607.56s -> 17622.09s]  these teeth? Are they different? They are. I have a little thing here. They are different.
[17627.85s -> 17639.10s]  I hate that. You found somebody. Wait, are these my teeth from like seven or eight years ago?
[17639.74s -> 17650.87s]  It's an AI app. Oh, I thought you took a photo. That would be pretty funny.
[17651.67s -> 17655.75s]  And I don't want to give you content ideas, but like if you had taken like my teeth from
[17655.75s -> 17660.95s]  like a decade ago, like right from like a face cam video from like 10 years ago or something
[17661.03s -> 17670.63s]  and like photoshopped my teeth on it. Look at how fucking I hate it. It's just unsettling and
[17670.63s -> 17682.18s]  makes me feel like shit looking at it. Have your teeth changed? Yeah, I think a little bit. I got
[17682.18s -> 17690.36s]  like a little space here now that I didn't have like seven or eight years ago. My teeth have moved
[17690.36s -> 17703.38s]  a little bit. Okay, so let me get back to this. I don't think it's worth using, but I'll try it
[17703.38s -> 17716.36s]  for a little while. That's pretty cool. All right, so now what? Okay, go back up to the roof.
[17718.26s -> 17743.59s]  I wonder if there's another boss here. It might be. Wait, no. But yeah, so I've beaten like three
[17743.59s -> 17754.26s]  main or four main story bosses. Christ. And what, like five or six just non-story optional bosses?
[17754.82s -> 17788.54s]  You guys don't get up, right? That guy's a crossbow. That was just instant. I thought he
[17788.54s -> 17821.42s]  was going to shoot one. He might drop that. No, please no. 7000 souls. They're gone. Whatever.
[17821.42s -> 17854.12s]  They're gone. Whatever. I didn't want them anyways. Just dead weight. Who hit that guy?
[17858.20s -> 17887.46s]  What the fuck? You gonna cry, bud? What do I think of Elden Ring so far? It's very good.
[17888.18s -> 17911.37s]  About these guys exist. He just. How is he still alive? What the fuck are you talking about? How?
[17924.98s -> 17951.05s]  Oh shit, out of magical power. Right, so now this guy. Long hallway. He fires. I just dodged through
[17951.05s -> 17962.92s]  it. I imagine we're just gonna run at him and he doesn't have a chance. Jesus, man. Okay.
[17965.66s -> 17969.70s]  Damn. I was about to take off my staff and start to play.
[17970.42s -> 18041.16s]  That thing's cool, but I want health. Can't reach. All right. My God. That guy's a pain in the ass.
[18041.16s -> 18046.04s]  I gotta go in there ready. I might just try to block or I mean, he, he, he tried.
[18046.84s -> 18083.56s]  Fuck. What about all these guys? Yeah. Is there something funny?
[18140.01s -> 18166.09s]  Fucking jeez, man. What the fuck? Azure's Glintstone staff. Now this looks to be a real
[18166.09s -> 18180.74s]  staff. One that I am very much excited about. Reduces cast time of all sorceries, but consumes
[18180.74s -> 18189.32s]  more FP. Reduce cast time though. That's huge because of the dexterity I'm building.
[18189.32s -> 18209.67s]  And look at how cool it looks. What does Dex have to do with cast time? In this game,
[18209.67s -> 18219.03s]  in Elden Ring, dexterity reduces cast time. Let me just see what the difference is.
[18235.14s -> 18244.68s]  That's pretty significant. And especially doing dexterity. I think this is the one. I need 52
[18244.68s -> 18260.47s]  intelligence though. It's time to start beefing up. All right. Well, that's really, really cool.
[18261.27s -> 18264.31s]  I, I know there's another place I can go on the rooftops, but I'd like to,
[18265.27s -> 18269.51s]  I've only done one or two real encounters like bosses in the game so far.
[18270.23s -> 18272.95s]  I've spent the last like five hours kind of exploring some of this other stuff.
[18274.55s -> 18281.83s]  I want to try to do this area here. Like it's maybe up, maybe like over here or up here.
[18282.47s -> 18293.24s]  If not there, then I really want to do maybe like up here, this way. Or first of all, I want to go
[18293.24s -> 18301.99s]  here because I think I need to for like progression. I also, I'm going to take a quick break.
[18302.63s -> 18312.87s]  I want to pee. I'll be back. I'll see you guys in a minute. Pee break. And the key, right? I'll mark
[18312.87s -> 18319.80s]  it all. Let me mark it. So everything on the map has significance and something I actually really
[18319.80s -> 18333.16s]  have to do. I'm going to get rid of this because, okay. So it's glintstone key, power place, and then
[18333.96s -> 18345.16s]  up here. These are the places I want to go. And I am going to, I think that's everything I can do
[18345.16s -> 18349.40s]  here. So I'm going to pour it out. I know this probably, there's one other place I didn't go on
[18349.40s -> 18355.50s]  the roof, but you know what? I mean, I got, maybe I'll come back later. I want to progress up
[18355.50s -> 18367.90s]  north more. So we are going to pour it out. I'm going to go here through the main, no, not the
[18367.90s -> 18376.94s]  main gate, like here and go to the tower. I'll be right back. See you guys in a minute.
[18571.13s -> 18577.75s]  I cleared my throat. That's how they know I'm back. Glintstones. Meet the glintstones.
[18579.59s -> 18600.57s]  Modern Stone Age. What kind of tea do you drink? It's matcha. Matcha powder. Green tea. Yep.
[18601.21s -> 18627.48s]  Irma, you're a basic white girl. What? It's, but I like matcha. It's, hey, you know what? Okay.
[18628.63s -> 18640.17s]  Okay. Do you see how, how powerful this is making me? Do you see how powerful this is making me over
[18640.17s -> 18660.02s]  the last four days? Matcha can be enjoyed by anybody and everyone. And I'm going to enjoy
[18660.02s -> 18677.19s]  some right now. I just put a, I just drank a little too much. Matcha, matcha man.
[18679.54s -> 18690.46s]  Matcha, matcha man. I want to be a matcha man. Matcha, matcha, matcha man. That was funny.
[18699.64s -> 18708.42s]  It was for one second, but I, okay. I went a full two seconds too long. It's a type of green tea.
[18709.38s -> 18714.63s]  It had a powder form. Don't overdo it though. It's pretty good for you. Don't, it's, it's got
[18714.63s -> 18719.27s]  caffeine in it. I mean, not as much as like a bunch of like espresso or anything, but
[18719.27s -> 18723.56s]  you know what I mean? Green tea is just good for you anyways. I would recommend people
[18723.56s -> 18730.54s]  be drinking it just regularly anyways, because it's just good for you. The law, it's a different
[18730.54s -> 18741.16s]  like kind of caffeine buzz than you get when you drink coffee. Doesn't have very much. What
[18741.16s -> 18745.72s]  do you like for a brand? I'm still figuring that out. I can't, I can't give you a full
[18745.72s -> 18754.81s]  recommendation yet. I'm still figuring that out. Matcha was not allowed during prohibition.
[18755.77s -> 18769.93s]  All right. We need to go that way. So I got to get on this bridge down here somehow.
[18771.59s -> 18793.93s]  I'm going to go ahead and do the fucking famed castle skip. Nailed it perfectly here. And on
[18793.93s -> 18803.82s]  this bridge over, where's this bridge? And I'm supposed to find that way. Where is it? Where is
[18803.82s -> 18851.98s]  it? I kind of don't know. I came on the wrong side. Let's go to the front door. I don't know.
[18851.98s -> 18862.01s]  I kind of don't know how to get there. Don't aggro the entire village. Front door is probably
[18862.01s -> 18882.39s]  where I need to go. Do they follow me down here? No. Wait, what about that dog with the knife in
[18882.39s -> 18889.06s]  his mouth? You guys know what I'm talking about? Remember that crazy like it had the wolf with like
[18889.06s -> 18906.17s]  a knife in his mouth? He was rammed. Where is that? I think that's right here. Isn't that dog down
[18906.17s -> 18919.86s]  here? Okay. Hold on. Where's that dog? Right there. Right there. Yep. I remember now. Let's kill this
[18919.86s -> 18967.00s]  guy. Okay. Well, God, man. Crush me? Jesus. Imagine even trying to fight this guy like 15, 20 levels
[18967.00s -> 19042.66s]  ago. Kill him. He's in front of you. I didn't dodge. Oh, fuck off. That stupid spin. That like
[19042.66s -> 19056.81s]  little wham at the end. Fuck you. That little like, oh, oops. I'm going to turn instantly and
[19056.81s -> 19078.36s]  hit you. Oh, fuck. I don't want to be here. I want to be here. Yeah. This is stupid. It's just like
[19078.36s -> 19086.68s]  I had it too. That fucker was dead. I could have. Okay. That's why greed is good. I'm never fucking
[19086.68s -> 19092.20s]  not listening to my gut again. I had an opportunity to hit him a third time and kill him, but I was
[19092.20s -> 19099.00s]  like, no, don't do that. That's a bad idea. Don't do that. And I would have, I would have won.
[19111.82s -> 19125.32s]  First of all, I need to put both headphones in because like these fucking guys. I got to get the
[19125.32s -> 19163.34s]  boys in. Why can't I call them? Excuse me. Does it be outside? What even hit me? This fucking dumb
[19163.34s -> 19225.80s]  ass. Get the stupid bow and arrow and shove it up your ass. Fuck you. God damn it. Peace blood,
[19225.80s -> 19248.25s]  old fang. Nice job, boys. Nice work. I'm imagining like a neighbor. No, fuck you.
[19249.13s -> 19255.14s]  Fuck you. No, you can take that bow and arrow and shove it up your ass. Bow and arrow? What's
[19255.14s -> 19276.89s]  happening in there? Okay. This is the way I need to go. What's he talking to? Ooh, this is cool.
[19276.89s -> 19293.22s]  Is this the right way? This is the right way, right? Yeah, it has to be. Ooh, missed an item.
[19295.22s -> 19327.43s]  Did? Where? Missed item. Up your ass. Nice. It's the bow. Over there, dude. What sword is this?
[19327.43s -> 19334.02s]  It is the carrion night sword. Really good if you're doing, uh, if you start as prisoner and you
[19334.02s -> 19339.86s]  really want to be the sorry bastard that says, I want to do just dex and intelligence. It's the
[19339.86s -> 19368.17s]  weapon for you. I like it. I like it so far. Bolt Drake talisman. Lightning damage negation. Okay.
[19368.17s -> 19381.54s]  I wonder. I wonder. I wonder if there's going to be some lightning damage. All right. Give me one
[19381.54s -> 19521.05s]  sec. One sec. I'll be right back. Three seconds. I'll be right back. Cheeseburgers. I told you I was
[19521.05s -> 19540.28s]  going to eat. Wait, both headphones got to go in. He's really got the burger king. I have to play
[19540.28s -> 19570.52s]  the part. Hey, why don't you send somebody that could actually fucking do. Oh, there's two of them.
[19570.52s -> 19596.54s]  Nevermind. There's three of them. Oh shit. Die. Get his power core out of his chest. God, that's way
[19597.50s -> 19612.07s]  easier than I thought it was going to be. How come he doesn't have any? Why does he have more power
[19612.07s -> 19659.53s]  core? How come you get extra power? What happened? The archer with an arrow? Really? I'm going to have
[19659.53s -> 19673.80s]  a greasy cheeseburger controller. I'm not eating like a bag of potato chips. I would, I would
[19673.80s -> 19678.04s]  probably tell you that like just a cheeseburger from like Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy, doesn't
[19678.04s -> 19682.84s]  matter. It's, that's not going to, you get a bun. It's not going to get, it's not grease all over
[19682.84s -> 19718.41s]  the bun. This is bread. You're going to be fine. Burgers are greasy as fuck. Um, not this part.
[19719.45s -> 19731.66s]  This is the part I'm touching. It's dry. It's dry, dry, dry, dry. This is bread. Where are you
[19731.66s -> 19758.66s]  getting your burgers from? Show fingers or you're lying. Fine. Perfectly fine. Show the other hand.
[19758.66s -> 19777.03s]  Fine. There's nothing on there. This is going to make, this is going to power me up for at least
[19777.03s -> 19802.82s]  another two, three hours at least. I guess there's a teleporter. What about over here? Disgusting
[19802.82s -> 19814.50s]  Daniel. It's easy. It's quick, fast. All right. I'm not, I'm not going to eat steak on dinner
[19814.50s -> 19819.43s]  on stream, but you, I'm not going to eat like a piece of salmon on camera.
[19819.43s -> 19856.90s]  Where's, I've been into a gross part. I've been into a gross part. I had, I had to get out, I had
[19856.90s -> 19901.45s]  to get out of my mouth. Ooh, cotton. Asher Forest scarab. It's like, like the, all right. Increases
[19901.45s -> 19923.29s]  damage taken, but reduces the FP costs of Asher's work. You guys know how it is. Sometimes you're
[19923.29s -> 19936.18s]  just biting into like kind of a gross part and you want to get it out. Why are you eating by
[19936.18s -> 19958.73s]  taking bites out of your table? I'm like eating my desk. It shouldn't be gross parts of things I'm
[19958.73s -> 19970.14s]  eating. Sometimes you bite into a gross part and you have to go like, oh, so I know some of you get
[19970.14s -> 20021.38s]  it. It's like two gross parts. Let me explain. Let me explain for all the people here that are
[20021.38s -> 20034.86s]  yelling at me. Let me explain. When you eat something that has a consistent texture across
[20034.86s -> 20043.77s]  the board, you know what each bite feels like. You know, the texture, you know, the give when
[20043.77s -> 20052.25s]  it's something off about that. When the texture changes in one of the bites, you kind of have to
[20052.25s -> 20066.98s]  say, well, that's something that different there. That's kind of weird. You get it. Okay.
[20068.10s -> 20088.38s]  I'm ready. Oh my God. That sounded so awful. You ready? Here we go. Um, it's, it was fine.
[20089.34s -> 20106.17s]  Nothing wrong with it. He's actually attacked. What's the Eagles? If you need,
[20106.17s -> 20126.89s]  Hey, you need Eagle feathers. They're here. I was talking to me. I was making a reference to me.
[20126.89s -> 20129.77s]  Like, Hey, if you need them, they're here. Idiot. Like talking to shit, like Jeremy,
[20129.77s -> 20146.78s]  like self-referential humor, dude, they don't stop moving. I'm trying to drink out of something
[20146.78s -> 20177.90s]  that's empty. Okay. So what's at the very end? Was there no reason to come down here? Oh,
[20177.90s -> 20203.26s]  fuck. Really? There's nothing over here. You fuck. That's really pretty. Invisible bridge.
[20203.26s -> 20223.24s]  I'm not walking over an invisible bridge. I, uh, it can't get your horse here. Uh, what?
[20231.08s -> 20237.45s]  Invisible bridge crew. There they are. There they are. They've made themselves known.
[20238.90s -> 20255.03s]  There's invisible bridge crew. Stop burping. Divine tower of living grave. How do I open it?
[20255.03s -> 20285.05s]  Like that. Right in the center. Very nice. Wait, I didn't read whatever that was. I bet you can't,
[20285.05s -> 20361.27s]  I bet you can't not talk for one minute. Try me. Ready? Three, two, one, begin. I won.
[20369.30s -> 20380.22s]  I won. It's my prize. All right. For five minutes now. I've already done this. All right.
[20380.78s -> 20389.67s]  I'll do it for five minutes. I'm going to wait till the clock strikes 5 41, five hours and 41
[20389.67s -> 20395.37s]  minutes and I'll start. You already did this. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. We already did
[20395.37s -> 20406.81s]  this. Be quiet for the rest of the entire stream. Well, if you would, I'll just leave. Everybody
[20406.81s -> 20426.20s]  would leave. There'd be nobody here. Oh, it's a finger. It's a dead two fingers. Restore the
[20426.20s -> 20451.77s]  power of the great rune. Rodrick's great rune. What does that do? Raises all attributes? Excuse
[20451.77s -> 20465.43s]  me. What are you talking about? Raises all attributes. How do I use this? You equip this
[20465.43s -> 20482.01s]  at the bonfire. Oh shit. Okay. Oh yeah. Is that, I think that's everything I can do here, right?
[20482.57s -> 20488.89s]  That's one thing done. Let's go do it. Is there any detriment to doing it?
[20489.45s -> 20504.90s]  Does it do anything? Is there like a, you just do it. Great runes. The great rune menu,
[20504.90s -> 20510.81s]  you can equip great runes that have had their power restored. You can use a rune arc to give
[20510.81s -> 20522.14s]  even greater benefits to your equipped great runes. Raises all attributes. By how much?
[20522.86s -> 20544.82s]  Did it do anything? I have to use a rune arc? It's, I have to use a rune arc. Um, it doesn't,
[20544.82s -> 20556.42s]  it doesn't do. Oh, I get it. So you equip it. You take a rune arc and that gives you,
[20556.50s -> 20568.26s]  okay. And then when you die, it's gone, right? That just, it's a humanity. Okay. Well,
[20568.26s -> 20573.74s]  I have no idea what the hell I'm going to use that. Anything else to do in here?
[20574.46s -> 20600.66s]  See power from remembrance. Purchase. Queen's robe. What does this do? Do I get any benefit
[20600.66s -> 20609.64s]  for wearing any of this stuff? Or is it just passion souls? There's new, uh, intelligence
[20609.64s -> 20612.36s]  stuff, right? The hat gives intelligence.
[20616.86s -> 20617.58s]  Feel her look.
[20644.31s -> 20656.71s]  I'm sorry. I mean, at some point you got to shave it all off.
[20659.11s -> 20661.75s]  It just doesn't look good. At some point you just got to get rid of it all.
[20679.03s -> 20685.24s]  Stop looking at it. So I have like eight, so I'm like,
[20685.72s -> 20694.79s]  yeah. You have anything new? No, I got everything I need from you. Thanks for the weapon, by the way.
[20696.46s -> 20707.69s]  Dumbass. All right. It's time to do step two. Step two was to go give this guy the key.
[20710.47s -> 20722.02s]  Step three, get the boys to plus 10. Did you eat without drinking? No, I got a drinker.
[20722.58s -> 20744.38s]  I really do wonder what this does, but I was going to kill me. Look what I got. I've got
[20744.38s -> 20758.73s]  something special for you. Give Adam the key. Yes, I am. Your soul.
[20770.52s -> 20786.47s]  It's kind of a Sims cry. Okay, so what? I will depart for the academy.
[20793.45s -> 20802.42s]  Decorated soul center by then. He's there now. I already bought everything he has.
[20810.42s -> 20818.23s]  Okay, so should I go back to the... Where is he? Now go find him in the academy?
[20819.40s -> 20831.06s]  Dude, this is gonna take fucking forever. Where would he be? Grand library? He's gonna die in
[20831.06s -> 20840.07s]  there. He's literally gonna die. Does he know that everyone's gone mad and he's gonna die?
[20860.38s -> 20866.54s]  Outside the classroom? This dude... Okay, this dude's definitely gonna be... Okay, here we go.
[20866.54s -> 20871.18s]  Here's my prediction. I'm gonna go to the classroom and he's gonna be lying face down
[20871.18s -> 20881.77s]  with an item on his back. Dead. That's what's gonna happen. He's just gonna be lying on the ground.
[20882.57s -> 20910.95s]  Okay, where are you at? Is he out here? I told you he was dead. I told you he was gonna be dead.
[20910.95s -> 20918.14s]  He's just sitting here. He didn't... Thop's bell bearing? An academy glintstone? Thop's barrier?
[20920.68s -> 20928.50s]  He's just dead. What killed him? This doesn't look like it was a murder. This looks like he
[20928.50s -> 20936.68s]  kind of just died in the chair. And by the way, how did you do all this out here? How did he get
[20936.68s -> 20950.22s]  in there to get all this equipment? It's like cold out here. He just got here. He just got here. We
[20950.22s -> 20958.34s]  said goodbye. He teleported here. He sat in the chair and just fucking died. All right, what was
[20958.34s -> 20967.18s]  all that stuff? Academy staff, which you already had. Thop's blessing or something. Whatever the
[20967.18s -> 20979.26s]  hell that was. What was... Oops. What was it called? Oops, bell bearing. Offered to twin maiden
[20979.34s -> 20997.29s]  husks for new item access. Okay, and then Thop's shield? Thop's barrier. A lifelong pursuit of
[20997.29s -> 21002.65s]  Thop's the blunt stone. Creates a magic force field that deflects sorceries and incantations.
[21002.65s -> 21017.93s]  Hold to continuously create barriers. Interesting. So it's an anti-magic shield. Okay, I'm willing to
[21017.93s -> 21029.10s]  try it. Well, thanks a lot, Thop. It was another place I needed to go. There it is. All right.
[21029.82s -> 21037.75s]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to progress up through northern
[21037.75s -> 21059.42s]  Lunaria Lake up this way. We're gonna go into this abandoned room right now, but not yet. Not yet.
[21059.42s -> 21065.29s]  Some unfinished business that needs to be taken care of. Are you high? Stop fucking blowing my
[21065.29s -> 21076.30s]  spot up, dude. Come on. I wouldn't fucking do that to you. Okay, so first of all, I need to see if
[21076.30s -> 21095.11s]  I can upgrade this weapon, because it's been a while. Zomber smithing stone five. Although I can
[21095.11s -> 21110.95s]  do this. This has to replace this, right? But I need 52 intelligence. All right.
[21110.95s -> 21149.37s]  That's plus one. Okay, oleg. I can just get oleg up and get him ready. Who else should I do this to?
[21149.37s -> 21153.93s]  The dogs? The dogs have been pretty useful. Or should I save it just in case? I guess I can get
[21153.93s -> 21170.07s]  everybody, right? Most of them? Never skip oleg day. You use the dogs once. I need grave glove
[21170.07s -> 21201.85s]  for it too. Or I'll probably run into it soon. I think that's all I can do. Oh, that's right.
[21208.86s -> 21232.31s]  New items. I want to know what that person's problem is. Here, take this. Offer bell bearing.
[21232.31s -> 21243.61s]  Offer thops bell bearing. Bell bearing shop one? Wait, it just puts his items here?
[21248.52s -> 21257.10s]  I already bought his shit. What the fuck did that guy do for me? He gave me a little rinky-dink
[21257.18s -> 21287.91s]  barrier spell. What's a memory slot? A memory card? Oh, it's for spells. Watch that spell
[21287.91s -> 21304.23s]  be incredible. Uh, let's see. Okay, I haven't done this. I don't know. What do I do? Okay, I'm gonna...
[21308.04s -> 21325.38s]  Does it matter? How many of these I can make? All right, I'll make like the liver thing that's like,
[21325.38s -> 21332.89s]  oh, you boost fire damage reduction, right? Or like, uh, blood loss. I don't think I can put
[21332.89s -> 21344.62s]  these on my weapon. I can't even use these. I can't coat this weapon with anything. It's already
[21344.62s -> 21356.62s]  coated with magical power. I'll make... Okay, I'm gonna make... I'll make four of those. Yeah, I did
[21356.62s -> 21363.45s]  it. I crafted things. Because if there's a fire boss or something, I can just take it. Buy the
[21363.45s -> 21381.75s]  spell slot. Coat it with matcha powder. I sold... Okay, I'm gonna sell some stuff. See if I can get
[21381.75s -> 21406.15s]  a three thousand. Buy the memory slot. All right, what's this bullshit that I don't want?
[21406.87s -> 21414.54s]  I'm not gonna use a great axe, so I'm scared of it. Alam's Halvard. Imagine dual welding these.
[21414.54s -> 21430.55s]  That's funny, but not me. Uh, I have two of these, so why do I have two of them? Okay. I am never
[21430.55s -> 21439.26s]  going to use these. I'm just gonna get rid of them. I have no... There's no point in keeping these.
[21451.05s -> 21468.84s]  I have 99 of these? That's a thousand souls. Where did I get three brass shields from?
[21468.84s -> 21495.56s]  All right, that should get me... Okay, now I can afford... What was it? Four thousand?
[21496.68s -> 21501.50s]  Or is it three thousand? I can have another spell.
[21507.90s -> 21517.86s]  I love the blue. Yeah, it looks great. Well, not that one. This one. I want to show it off.
[21519.16s -> 21526.23s]  Well, I can't. I tried to play this game, but I burnt my PC. It exploded.
[21527.62s -> 21535.83s]  I'll get it on PlayStation 4 or Xbox. All right, here it is.
[21537.99s -> 21558.65s]  Priest memory slots. So now I have four. I'll try it. Let me try this, and let's take
[21559.77s -> 21566.70s]  gravity off, and we'll try the real... Okay, I did this guy's entire quest line, and actually,
[21566.70s -> 21586.55s]  I want to move these around. I want the two damage weapons to be here, because I want this to be
[21586.55s -> 21604.38s]  this. This to be this. Okay, I'll try it. Bedtime? It is not my bedtime. It is time to go.
[21605.18s -> 21629.08s]  Nothing else to clean up. I'm ready. I'm making noises? I can't help it. People think that I just
[21629.08s -> 21634.44s]  do this because I'm on stream. I just do this in like the bathtub. I'll be in the bathtub just
[21634.44s -> 21646.57s]  going like... I'm a bird. I'm like a weird parrot thing. I actually think I might have been a bird.
[21647.29s -> 21651.74s]  You don't ask why birds do that shit, because they just do, and it's not like, hey, birds,
[21651.74s -> 21655.90s]  shut the fuck up. Why are you making sounds? They sing their songs, and everybody loves them.
[21656.46s -> 21671.21s]  What have you ever told a bird to shut the fuck up? Just being real. King's Realm Ruins.
[21672.54s -> 21692.02s]  Cool. Not enough of that. Not about enough of that.
[21701.78s -> 21708.81s]  Ah, EZ, forgive me. These Royal Guards grounds were placed in our trust, but we stood no chance.
[21714.30s -> 21738.97s]  I just like farted in the bathtub. Can I be real with everybody for a second? Who else is afraid
[21740.57s -> 21746.57s]  to fart in the bathtub, because you're afraid you're going to shit, like you're going to shit
[21746.57s -> 21756.04s]  your pants, or shit the tub, and like shit in the tub, because I am. Like, oh, I think I'm going to
[21756.04s -> 21762.84s]  go ahead and just do this. Like, what if you just like shit? I've had plenty of accidents over the
[21762.84s -> 21781.30s]  years. Not in the tub. That's not going to happen. That's why I can't be on camera. No one asked this.
[21781.30s -> 21797.46s]  I know. I'm sorry. What the fuck? You've been streaming? No, I'm fine. Relax. What an Andy.
[21797.46s -> 21809.16s]  You didn't even say what kind of Andy. What the hell? Um, there's something under here.
[21812.38s -> 21832.58s]  It's probably a dungeon. So now my sorceries are stronger here. What's this? What's this one?
[21833.46s -> 21861.24s]  Why does this seem like a shield? It's a spell parry? Hold it. Yeah, I am. I'm holding it right
[21861.24s -> 21878.66s]  now. I wonder what that is. Does it hurt other people? I'll try it. But let me see if there's
[21878.66s -> 21903.51s]  anything under there. There's a ruin here. It takes too fucking long. How am I supposed to
[21903.51s -> 21919.72s]  parry this? All right, congratulations. Stop. Uh, you got a fucking blintstone key for literally
[21919.72s -> 21950.09s]  no reason. All right, let me find out what this is. We're looking for a way to go down in the
[21950.09s -> 21985.42s]  dungeon. I saw it right here. That guy. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? I need to find it.
[21985.98s -> 22017.37s]  I must find it. Find I if you haven't seen any of those stuff. What the fuck is that?
[22018.09s -> 22025.37s]  They're reading a book. That's huge guys. They're just reading a book.
[22026.01s -> 22055.72s]  Is that an NPC? What's your name? We don't receive many visitors. I presume you are.
[22055.72s -> 22073.70s]  What brings you here? This guy's got an anvil. It's hardly my place to ask, is it? I am EG,
[22074.50s -> 22086.33s]  a blacksmith who once served the Carian Royals. Still quietly ply my trade on this spot.
[22087.13s -> 22094.09s]  Perhaps you'd like a display. These bones are old, but still able.
[22096.36s -> 22108.50s]  This is not the blacksmith. Oh, come on, dude. Really? I need somersmithing stone five.
[22108.50s -> 22112.58s]  You have up to four. You don't have five.
[22172.09s -> 22193.03s]  I have that sword. All right, well, you've got those, but you don't have the ones I need.
[22197.45s -> 22202.17s]  Enchanted snare, day away from that death trap.
[22203.05s -> 22207.99s]  Well, I'm not going to listen to a single word you said and I'm going to go get killed
[22207.99s -> 22221.83s]  probably two to three hundred more times. Have a good one. This is where I look over at him and
[22221.83s -> 22264.66s]  he just goes. I don't know why I'm going this way, but I decided to go this way. Oh, hell yeah.
[22264.66s -> 22308.14s]  Oh my goodness. Look at all this. Very nice. Is it maybe the back door? Maybe there is a back door.
[22308.14s -> 22323.46s]  Oh, that does not look like a back entrance. It's not a back door. Can I do anything with
[22323.46s -> 22348.63s]  this big rock formation? I don't think so. Cool looking rock. Here it comes. No,
[22348.63s -> 22364.60s]  it's not coming. I want to get off the horse because I don't think I can turn well.
[22366.52s -> 22378.63s]  Turning there, I probably would have fall down. It's so fucking pretty. It's so cool looking.
[22378.63s -> 22388.41s]  All right. All right. Let's just go on the front door. Who cares? Give me the fucking item.
[22388.97s -> 22435.82s]  There's a lake over there. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[22436.46s -> 22470.31s]  I just checked the other side. No, we'll go front door. We made it. Lock raid. Oh,
[22470.31s -> 22484.06s]  I thought somebody actually raided Aria Manor. That's terrifying. Is that a hand?
[22491.03s -> 22506.55s]  Fucking. Oh, fucking. It is a hand.
[22531.51s -> 22533.75s]  All right. The pinky fingers of the other. They can't do anything.
[22542.49s -> 22552.38s]  Somersmithing stone too. I need a five. Please. I don't like that either. Yeah. It's disgusting.
[22561.83s -> 22608.92s]  We'll check over here first. Linstone craftsman's cookbook. Okay. Magic grease,
[22609.56s -> 22613.51s]  raw string magic grease. I just don't think I can use any of it.
[22614.15s -> 22636.94s]  That was heartless. Was it though? I have that too. I just can't use it.
[22651.75s -> 22660.26s]  Oh, they're like booby traps. Okay. Spitting stone three. No fives.
[22678.23s -> 22724.52s]  Minus two and a three. There's other little hands. Oops. Get your little friends out of here.
[22727.27s -> 22754.30s]  Very bad. God damn it. Fuck off. You can't be kidding me. Dude, I'm stuck in the fucking.
[22754.30s -> 22761.06s]  I can't get out of here. What was I stuck on? What was it? What was on me? What was in the way?
[22761.06s -> 22834.49s]  I'm just gonna fucking run out of this shit. That is way too slow. Way too slow. Shit, man.
[22834.49s -> 22840.50s]  Do I really have to fight two of these guys at the same goddamn time? Holy shit. Fuck this area.
[22841.46s -> 22879.40s]  Oh. Oh. Whoa. There he is. You fucker. I was looking around for him.
[22880.12s -> 22895.43s]  Actually, I was looking for him and I couldn't see him. Did he come out of the ground? Fucking
[22895.43s -> 22916.22s]  worst enemy in the game. It's like so hard to tell what part of his hand is attacking you. It's like
[22916.22s -> 22921.51s]  it's such a weird fucking way to attack. I can't, I like, I don't know which one of his fingers is
[22921.51s -> 22973.96s]  gonna fucking swing at me. It's like half of his hand attacks you. Oh my fucking God. I'm gonna
[22973.96s -> 23006.98s]  kill this guy because I'm fucking mad. Fuck you for being in here. Oh, I'm dead because of so much
[23006.98s -> 23022.70s]  health. What a shit enemy. I don't want to fight any more of these guys. I'm literally just walking
[23022.70s -> 23078.74s]  by him. Rimmed crystal bud. All right, that's it. I missed so much shit over there, but I don't care.
[23079.46s -> 23139.46s]  I'm in severe concentration mode. I gotta run in and pray for a bonfire. That almost just fucking
[23140.18s -> 23154.98s]  bonfire. Bonfire? It can't come in here. Oh, are you gonna do that again? No. Lady Rani,
[23154.98s -> 23161.14s]  we have long awaited you. I pray for your house's swift revival. May the full moon shine upon Karya.
[23161.78s -> 23172.68s]  You gonna do PvP? Um, I don't know. Not in the immediate future. Maybe eventually.
[23175.90s -> 23213.10s]  Maybe after a little while. I want to beat the game. Okay, examine this area. You're not fucking
[23213.10s -> 23217.74s]  hands. I don't want to fight those hands anymore. They're the worst.
[23226.70s -> 23230.62s]  As long as you guys don't have like fingers crawling out of your eyeballs and shit. I don't
[23230.62s -> 23250.18s]  care. I'll fight all of you. Will you lock on please? This is an ugly place to fight.
[23268.79s -> 23301.86s]  Don't fall off. Don't roll off. What? What? What? What? What? I didn't hit him? What? Did he? Was
[23301.86s -> 23308.90s]  his foot a centimeter away? Every time I'm a centimeter away, I get hit by that bullshit.
[23309.54s -> 23353.16s]  A lot of things went wrong there. Suck my ass. I almost jumped off the edge. I'm fucking sweating.
[23353.80s -> 23379.83s]  Okay, what about this way? Let's go this way first. Watch out for their magic.
[23389.16s -> 23410.62s]  Why are the trees moving? This tree is moving weirdly. Like it's gonna lift up and it's gonna
[23410.62s -> 23427.48s]  be a guy's face. I was waiting for the tree to do something. I thought it was gonna be,
[23427.48s -> 23437.19s]  I thought it was a guy's hair. He's gonna be like, and just fucking smash me.
[23437.75s -> 23498.49s]  Did you do the goofy goober dance? My mistake was going there in the first place.
[23498.49s -> 23538.52s]  Guess what the hell was over there? A rune arc? Who gives a shit? Yoch! Yoch! Yoch! Huh? Oh you
[23538.52s -> 23568.81s]  fucker. There's no stagger with this guy. I'm not putting up with him. Okay, so I just got punished
[23568.81s -> 23576.25s]  for going over there because everybody just collapsed on me. Am I tripping over a mine or
[23576.25s -> 23585.35s]  something? Am I summoning them? How am I, how is this happening? Am I spawning them? I feel like
[23585.35s -> 23593.00s]  I'm spawning them. I'm spawning them. They're being spawned when I cross a certain threshold,
[23593.08s -> 23599.16s]  like a certain spawn area. Or did they just, maybe they just do it randomly always? I don't know.
[23599.16s -> 23616.31s]  Interesting. Very interesting. Yeah, I'm not gonna get fooled by that. Nope, no, I'm sorry.
[23617.67s -> 23644.17s]  Not, not after like 25 minutes here. Holy shit! That sucks absolute balls. I'm gonna run.
[23657.06s -> 23726.36s]  Relax. Get that shit out of here. I'm the right firing. Really? Are you serious dude? Fuck you.
[23726.92s -> 23733.75s]  I'm sitting there paying attention to the guy back here shooting from a hundred miles away.
[23733.75s -> 23738.52s]  I have to kill him now because, yeah, I just spawned like three people probably.
[23741.08s -> 23763.61s]  Yeah, I fucking knew it. You fateful shit. How dare you. Fuck you. Oh, fuck you. I don't want
[23763.61s -> 23786.09s]  to fight him. I'm running to the door. I'm just checking for items. I just need to see if there's
[23786.09s -> 23815.27s]  items. Oh, see you later. Thank god. Oh my goodness. That was horrible. That was so scary.
[23815.27s -> 23836.06s]  It was so awful. And the hand was fucked. Fuck those hands. Oh, I can upgrade my class. I have
[23836.06s -> 23840.86s]  to go back to that area later. I don't want to go back to that fucking place. I don't like
[23840.86s -> 23845.66s]  those hands. They're too freaky. They're freaky. Like super like freaky freaky. I don't like it.
[23849.30s -> 23883.21s]  Too freaky. Way too freaky. So there's a summoning stone thing there. I wonder if there's
[23883.21s -> 23918.22s]  something here. That was a little bit different move. Really? That was kind of a different move.
[23965.69s -> 23976.81s]  God, he's just bouncing around. What is this fucking move set? He looks like he's lagging.
[23976.81s -> 24007.32s]  He has like 3000 fucking ping. He's like, God, what am I connecting to? Are the boys plus 10?
[24007.32s -> 24014.12s]  We need way more materials to get the boys to plus 10 that I just I do not have. We need like
[24015.42s -> 24029.13s]  what I got the boys to plus one. That's as far as I could get. You will regret upgrading the boys.
[24029.13s -> 24034.01s]  I probably will because like literally the first that's the first item that you get in the game.
[24034.01s -> 24046.78s]  I think that's like the first item. Oh shit. Headphones are going in for this one. I'll
[24046.78s -> 24080.06s]  leg up here. Seems safer. But again, there's always these old guys that just die in one hit.
[24083.45s -> 24087.50s]  I don't think these guys even know that they're here. They're kind of just wandering around with
[24087.50s -> 24099.91s]  a stick that they found on the ground. And when they go like this stuff comes out and they just
[24099.91s -> 24105.29s]  go, I guess I'll do that to people. All right. Yeah, I'm not fighting the giant knight.
[24107.02s -> 24115.64s]  If I can get behind him. Well, I'm killing them because they're attacking me.
[24116.28s -> 24120.23s]  They're trying to kill me. I'm just defending myself.
[24133.14s -> 24142.52s]  Geez. I don't I mean that guy has that guy is just a big version of me.
[24145.93s -> 24167.91s]  I don't have. I can't fight that guy right now. There's a fire up here. Maybe.
[24169.03s -> 24173.88s]  Oh my fucking God. It's a guy with one of those things. He's got one of these things.
[24175.08s -> 24178.79s]  Oh my God. Fireworks just went by my screen.
[24207.77s -> 24248.20s]  Duck. Okay. Um, I don't know if I want to go there.
[24248.92s -> 24254.49s]  It looks like a new area. That is a pot down there. You're right. That's a pretty, that's a
[24254.49s -> 24268.12s]  Pog pot. Oh, thank God. Oh my goodness. I'm saved. Actually saved right there.
[24269.69s -> 24304.12s]  Okay. Now I don't feel as bad as a boss without a without a doubt. I have 8,000 souls.
[24304.12s -> 24318.50s]  I'm not going for it. I'd rather fall down here, die and spawn there and run over here.
[24318.50s -> 24356.65s]  I'm going to check over here first. It seems safer to me somehow.
[24356.65s -> 24361.37s]  Oh shit. They all came over. Oh my God. They're everywhere.
[24361.37s -> 24363.61s]  They're fucking everywhere. They're everywhere.
[24383.82s -> 24389.34s]  The cracked pot. Is that it? Can I go anywhere from here though?
[24389.34s -> 24393.46s]  I think this is, can I get out of here? How do I get out of here?
[24395.82s -> 24416.41s]  Why would I go that way? Is there a door? Shit. All right. This is pot village.
[24425.27s -> 24430.79s]  I don't want to go to hand town. Everything has to be a town or a village. Oh, a hand place.
[24431.51s -> 24437.62s]  Pot town, pot village, pot world, hand world, hand city.
[24438.18s -> 24446.28s]  I'm just trying to make sure this is safe because look at my health.
[24446.28s -> 24464.18s]  Oh, that was almost not safe. What do you, what's behind you?
[24465.66s -> 24466.38s]  There's something behind.
[24497.85s -> 24518.65s]  Even think about it. All this way for something that might be good.
[24520.36s -> 24526.09s]  All this way. God damn it. What is that?
[24526.57s -> 24541.86s]  Oh shit. I'm fine. Hand, hand, hand. Oh, I need to teleport. How do I teleport? I gotta kill this.
[24542.98s -> 24572.65s]  Okay. Very important. Did I do this yet? I did already. Okay. I think I have enough to level up.
[24574.86s -> 24585.93s]  I definitely do. That was insane. That was, my heart is just like exploding.
[24586.81s -> 24599.21s]  13, 14, 15. Okay, that's enough. That was an absolute roller coaster. It really was.
[24602.70s -> 24607.34s]  Uh, mind is the easy one here because it gets us closer to Oleg.
[24609.11s -> 24629.32s]  Or I gotta start pumping intelligence. All right. So that was that.
[24629.32s -> 24634.20s]  That was that whole chain of events took us that way. So now I'm not completely uncomfortable
[24635.51s -> 24643.02s]  going, uh, this way now, which I want to see what's in that boss room.
[24643.02s -> 24657.83s]  I'm very, very, very curious. What about the new spell? Oh yeah. I'll look at it too.
[24657.83s -> 24669.58s]  It's a good call. Oh, you know what? No, let's, let's go for this. Might as well. It's right here.
[24681.51s -> 24684.23s]  He can't fit through this door. So like I can get rid of these,
[24684.87s -> 24691.30s]  I can get rid of these idiots and he can't get through here and then it'll be a one-on-one
[24696.89s -> 24699.85s]  or I'll just fucking die. That's one way that could happen.
[24705.67s -> 24717.74s]  Hey, um, so that would have been okay. Uh, I should have done the big sword move,
[24724.25s -> 24729.16s]  which I want to make sure it's there. Okay. The big sword works really well on those guys.
[24730.89s -> 24734.01s]  And I have to get rid of the, in case that happens again, just kill the dog.
[24734.01s -> 24778.46s]  The dog is gone. I can pull them back here if I need to. Okay. Now let's try this again.
[24779.02s -> 24815.30s]  In fact, here, just like, fuck you buddy. Now you come with me. Really? Get over here.
[24815.30s -> 24881.74s]  Okay. Now you. Boys, where am I? Shit. Oh boy. That's not good. Oh, he just
[24881.74s -> 24911.45s]  bumped into the wall. No, get him. Oh shit. Oh my God. I didn't dodge. Oh shit. Where are they?
[24920.90s -> 24984.97s]  Oh my God. Your moves don't, I don't know how to time them. Hey, this is a cult. Oh man. Really?
[24988.01s -> 25001.53s]  No shit. Wow. It's a magic strength. Dex scaling weapon. What does that sound like?
[25001.53s -> 25016.47s]  That sounds like somebody. I don't know who. All right. Well, that's really cool. I don't know.
[25016.47s -> 25032.84s]  How much help do I have? None. I mean, there's, there's really no point to me. I just go back
[25032.84s -> 25052.57s]  to the bonfire, right? Like, what's the point of me doing this to die? Your German, bro,
[25052.57s -> 25062.98s]  heal, bro. German, bro, heal, bro. I'm all right. Well, that was intense. Now we do the fun thing
[25062.98s -> 25067.70s]  where I go look at the boss and then figure out if I am too burnt out to continue to play.
[25068.90s -> 25078.50s]  I'm definitely feeling it. I'm definitely starting to feel the, uh, or like 42 straight hours of
[25078.50s -> 25085.38s]  playing this game. Uh, I'm starting to kind of burn out a little. Mach of burnout. Yeah. I'm
[25085.38s -> 25096.54s]  getting some mach of burnout here. 42 straight hours. I know that I'm kidding.
[25097.88s -> 25105.61s]  How long has it been? 37, 35, 38 hours straight. Essentially sleeping in between
[25106.49s -> 25110.01s]  and like morning errands and, you know, going to the bathroom.
[25110.73s -> 25124.82s]  Okay. What's going on here? What is this? Royal Knight Loretta. Do I get a horse too? Where's
[25124.82s -> 25192.49s]  my horse? Where's my horse? Oh, that was a new move. That was a one, two. Thankfully it's right
[25192.49s -> 25219.86s]  here. I wonder if you stay on his, uh, right side. Ooh, okay. That's a little, that's a little snipe.
[25220.82s -> 25248.30s]  All right. Yeah. I got to stay on his other side. Yeah. He's a pain in the ass if he can't swing
[25248.30s -> 25307.16s]  this way. Oh, you fucking idiot. Oh, I have the gravestone behind me. I really, really, really
[25307.16s -> 25315.05s]  need to go find a flask upgrade. I think, I think I might have to do some flask upgrade after this.
[25316.01s -> 25343.45s]  Okay. Dude, dude, what? Okay. Do something else. Shit. He's not that bad. I'll get him.
[25344.17s -> 25358.60s]  Unless it's like a phase two, which he knows. All right. So, okay. He spins,
[25360.12s -> 25364.26s]  he spins it around before he swings it. When he did, when he does that, you're close enough.
[25365.06s -> 25406.63s]  No, I thought he was going to do another move. Dude, like, let me just, let me get a hit it.
[25407.35s -> 25493.85s]  Like, it's not very much open. I even waited to spin. This is new. I don't know what that is.
[25495.03s -> 25506.26s]  Oh, that's new too. Okay. Uh, he forgot he has magic. Uh, casting a spell at this boss is pretty
[25506.26s -> 25516.28s]  much, I'm guaranteed to die. Takes too long. And so this, this guy's magic. He's, he's definitely,
[25517.24s -> 25525.74s]  he's going to be immune to magic. I could do the boys. Let's see.
[25526.38s -> 25576.84s]  Can't put a lock onto him. Nice job, boys. Excellent work. And add a stamina. Or I don't
[25576.84s -> 25581.24s]  know what the fuck happened. I just like got caught up with all the loud sounds and all.
[25584.79s -> 25588.79s]  I don't even know what happened. I just like all the sounds. There's so much fucking sounds.
[25588.79s -> 25594.66s]  I just heard like, I just heard it like screams and slashes and like, I just like,
[25594.66s -> 25597.22s]  I'm just going to be a part of it. I'm going to get up there. I'm going to slash him too.
[25600.81s -> 25649.14s]  Something in my eye. Come on, boys. Get him. I thought I got under the horse. I thought I
[25649.14s -> 25694.28s]  got under the horse, but I didn't. Oh, come on. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[25694.28s -> 25712.54s]  How do I get away from this? Just dodge it. What the fuck? Jump, maybe jump. I don't, I don't know.
[25713.42s -> 25719.54s]  Jump over it. I dodged that pretty, I thought that was pretty good dodge.
[25721.45s -> 25728.15s]  Maybe jump. Dodge forward. Dodge into it. I won't, it won't hit me, right?
[25736.66s -> 25742.50s]  Dodge forward might work, but it's an explosion. Isn't dodging forward the same distance as
[25742.50s -> 25752.42s]  dodging to the right or left? Wrong thing up. This is a wash. Yeah, just kill me.
[25757.00s -> 25765.98s]  I didn't have the boys ready. What about the thop shield? I feel like it's, that's so,
[25765.98s -> 25770.31s]  that's so hard to use because it's like, one, you got to time that perfectly.
[25770.95s -> 25784.73s]  I don't think I need it. I think as long as I could reliably get away from the whatever it is.
[25785.45s -> 25789.53s]  Do I have the thop step? I already found the thop step. It was just the academy step.
[25790.41s -> 25809.74s]  Uh, I forgot again. Yeah, kill me again. I keep forgetting to summon them when I get in.
[25810.62s -> 25819.98s]  I also might have to stop streaming. My eyes, I can like feel my eyes starting to like pulse.
[25820.86s -> 25829.85s]  It's probably time to stop. And I would, I, I thought I was going to be able to go longer
[25829.85s -> 25889.66s]  today. I don't, I don't think so. Did you hit, he didn't even swing at me. Billy, eat shit.
[25890.46s -> 25933.59s]  How many attacks? That's kind of bullshit. All right, here we go.
[25934.23s -> 26026.17s]  Dodge through it. Let's go on a good one. Go on a good one.
[26040.42s -> 26055.02s]  Oh man, that was hard. Magical bow? Yeah, that wasn't too bad. It was just trying to figure out
[26055.02s -> 26062.04s]  how to get away from the projectiles. Cause once, once you understand that, like, it's hard to
[26062.04s -> 26066.38s]  determine if he's going to swing more than two or three times, but just let him do it. Right?
[26067.26s -> 26075.48s]  When he, when, when you're next to him and he's like, swing, swing, don't attack. Like sometimes
[26075.48s -> 26079.64s]  he does it twice. Sometimes he does it three times. Sometimes he does it four times. You just,
[26079.64s -> 26088.66s]  just dodge it, just dodge. And then when he stops, take a swing. That was on 10,000 souls? Really?
[26089.85s -> 26115.58s]  That's it? Only 10k? That's kind of horseshit. Did he have a, let me see those spells.
[26119.08s -> 26128.20s]  Oh, these are crystals. Oh, that's probably so cool though. Let me see.
[26139.98s -> 26144.81s]  Imagine hitting somebody with this. I imagine shooting that. That's no way you're going to hit
[26144.81s -> 26153.82s]  anybody with that. Not a chance. I mean, maybe you'll hit. I mean, that's, that's awesome.
[26155.42s -> 26160.79s]  All right. I gotta call it. I, I, I can't go anymore. I thought I was going to be able to
[26160.79s -> 26165.91s]  go for like at least another hour or two. No, no way. You can probably tell my like energy,
[26165.91s -> 26171.85s]  like an hour ago. I went from like a seven, eight out of 10 energy to like a three or like a four,
[26171.85s -> 26178.10s]  like, like 45 minutes ago. I'll go back through. I'm not, we're not, I'm not going to be streaming
[26178.10s -> 26197.02s]  tomorrow. The next time I will be live. Let's do today. Okay. I will see you guys for more Elden
[26197.02s -> 26210.70s]  Ring on Wednesday. I'll take a couple of days. I'll refresh and we will go Wednesday, probably
[26210.70s -> 26216.79s]  Wednesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Cause I'm into it. I don't want to, I don't want
[26216.79s -> 26222.54s]  to take too long of a break. Maybe like a day or two. Cause I really don't want to lose the muscle
[26222.54s -> 26228.06s]  memory. Cause if you don't play for like a week and you come back, you just, you're like a wet
[26228.06s -> 26232.81s]  sock. You're like a, you're like a dirty wet sock and it doesn't work. You'll forget how to play.
[26232.81s -> 26241.30s]  Yeah. It's true. Wednesday at, yeah. Wednesday at four. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Thanks
[26241.30s -> 26244.34s]  for hanging out. Thanks for watching the streams. I think we're making pretty good progress.
[26244.98s -> 26251.26s]  And I talked a lot of shit about this area, but you know, I literally talk shit about the entire
[26251.26s -> 26258.34s]  game the entire time I'm playing. I'll see you Wednesday. Thanks for watching. We'll hang out
[26258.34s -> 26269.82s]  for a minute. Uh, that's saved there. Best boss in the game is coming up. Ooh, well I'm excited for
[26269.82s -> 26280.15s]  Wednesday. Thanks for staying up too. I know I, I, this launch has been kind of crazy. All these,
[26281.56s -> 26285.64s]  all these streams going into like three o'clock in the morning Eastern, four o'clock in the morning
[26285.64s -> 26291.37s]  Eastern pretty much. That will probably change a little once, uh, you know, maybe there's this
[26291.37s -> 26301.46s]  next week rolls around, but I am fucking tired. It's so funny cause like, okay, after the pot
[26301.46s -> 26307.38s]  almost killed me twice, my soul left my body even more than it already was. I don't, I'm actually,
[26307.38s -> 26311.14s]  I'm not even, I'm surprised I actually could beat this guy. People were asking me like questions
[26311.14s -> 26316.26s]  and I was like, I do what I did. I can't do that. I think I just shut my brain off and fought him.
[26320.60s -> 26339.38s]  Oh, machete immunity building up. Oh, that's just been four days. Empty head implying that you're
[26339.38s -> 26345.06s]  going to beat it. Pepe laughing. I beat Dark Souls three on stream. I beat Sekiro on stream.
[26345.06s -> 26356.82s]  If I can do Sekiro, which I think Sekiro was harder than this game so far, this is much longer than
[26356.82s -> 26364.02s]  Sekiro, but I think the difficulty in playing Sekiro is harder than this. They're harder in
[26364.02s -> 26368.98s]  different ways, but this one, this is like the harder, I don't know where I would put this in
[26368.98s -> 26376.17s]  difficulty. I really don't know. I think Sekiro is, I think is much more difficult because the
[26376.17s -> 26380.71s]  game is played a lot differently and it was a lot, it was really hard to get used to the fact that
[26380.71s -> 26387.11s]  you had to just sit there in L1 of every single enemy in the game. You couldn't like dodge around.
[26387.11s -> 26392.39s]  You couldn't, there was no sorcery. There was no dodge mechanic that was, you know, that's it. You
[26392.39s -> 26397.83s]  died. You could dodge, but it wasn't even close to, you needed to parry. You had to parry almost
[26397.83s -> 26406.55s]  every single attack. Well, I think this is probably the hardest of the Dark Souls-like games.
[26408.52s -> 26414.18s]  That's tough though, because I do remember, I remember a few encounters in Dark Souls three
[26414.18s -> 26421.34s]  being like unbearable. I'm trying to think of like comparing some hard bots. It's been so long since
[26421.34s -> 26428.60s]  I played Dark Souls three. Like Pontiff maybe. I remember struggling with Pontiff and being like,
[26428.60s -> 26436.58s]  holy shit, this guy's like not completable. I haven't really, okay, I haven't really thought
[26436.58s -> 26446.17s]  that way yet about any, Pontiff was easy. Pontiff was easy if you could parry, because you could
[26446.17s -> 26453.00s]  parry him, right? It was the, when he summoned the second clone of himself, it just was so,
[26453.00s -> 26461.77s]  my brain was so hard to dodge and get around the clone. The DLC dragon? Yeah, okay, there it is.
[26461.77s -> 26465.53s]  Yeah, some of the DLC in Dark Souls three was unbelievably difficult. I remember, I actually
[26465.53s -> 26475.66s]  had to summon people for that shit. I remember summoning people for that dragon. Yeah, Midir.
[26475.66s -> 26482.82s]  Midir, it was unbearable. Nameless King was pretty bad too, but I feel like Nameless King was not
[26482.82s -> 26488.84s]  as, just, Midir just had so much health. The fight just dragged on so long that you got kind of like
[26488.84s -> 26493.93s]  exhausted halfway through it. Oh no, I never beat Midir. I remember summoning four people and we
[26493.93s -> 26505.72s]  couldn't do it. All right, I'm taking a break from streaming for a day and a half, two days.
[26505.72s -> 26515.08s]  Thanks again everybody. I'll see you soon. I believe there's a big boss coming up here.
[26515.08s -> 26519.62s]  We'll find out. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[26520.34s -> 26524.33s]  Take care of yourselves. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go take a shower
[26525.13s -> 26532.44s]  and I'll see you guys Wednesday at four o'clock. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves.
[26532.44s -> 26533.48s]  Have a great night.
