[1.53s -> 19.99s]  I know the pieces fit cause I watch them fall away.
[19.99s -> 20.79s]  Hold on.
[29.10s -> 33.05s]  This is super liminal.
[33.05s -> 48.41s]  So this game suck.
[48.41s -> 63.26s]  Well, how's this game? Is it good? Is that better?
[63.26s -> 68.87s]  How's that sound? Louder? Shorter? Longer? Whatever you want.
[68.87s -> 72.02s]  This is a tuber game. All right, this should be fun then.
[72.02s -> 75.46s]  All right, how about the graphics?
[76.74s -> 78.66s]  Default. Okay, this is probably fine.
[80.62s -> 86.20s]  This is high. Ambient occlusion. Gross.
[86.20s -> 100.41s]  That's yeah, whatever.
[100.41s -> 102.87s]  All right, let's go.
[102.87s -> 103.99s]  Wait, is there FOV?
[105.82s -> 107.74s]  Ah, thank God. Okay.
[107.74s -> 109.00s]  Turn this down.
[109.96s -> 111.56s]  Attention to be refined. Subtitles.
[111.56s -> 114.76s]  Yeah, 2560 by 1440. What a big ass screen.
[114.76s -> 117.00s]  Oh, we're turning that up.
[117.00s -> 129.11s]  I mean, that's not high enough.
[129.11s -> 133.62s]  Okay, super liminal. Terms of service.
[133.62s -> 138.06s]  I just, wait, I signed it?
[138.06s -> 139.58s]  I didn't want to sign it. I just want to look at it.
[139.58s -> 149.75s]  This FOV feels huge.
[149.75s -> 151.67s]  You missed the intro.
[151.67s -> 163.85s]  What intro?
[163.85s -> 165.05s]  You missed the intro.
[165.05s -> 166.95s]  Who cares? Does it matter?
[166.95s -> 205.78s]  I'll turn it up.
[206.26s -> 215.83s]  So I see an ad for that and then I go do it.
[215.91s -> 218.89s]  And I need to, I had to see that so badly.
[221.72s -> 222.52s]  You could have just told me,
[222.52s -> 224.68s]  hey, you saw an ad on TV for this place.
[224.68s -> 229.10s]  Is that better?
[229.10s -> 236.63s]  Now you have context.
[236.63s -> 237.27s]  Yeah, that's true.
[237.27s -> 254.97s]  Let's go ahead and sign it. Sign it with my nose.
[254.97s -> 256.97s]  Reception is reality. Grab.
[256.97s -> 276.12s]  What? I don't get it.
[276.12s -> 282.25s]  Okay, because it's making, it's bigger?
[282.25s -> 290.68s]  Yeah, that's trippy.
[290.68s -> 299.48s]  How do I, oh, there we go.
[299.48s -> 325.86s]  Do I, what do I just do? Duck?
[325.86s -> 327.96s]  Oh, cool. All right.
[327.96s -> 331.18s]  Okay, I get it.
[331.18s -> 339.19s]  Terms of service accepted.
[339.19s -> 341.59s]  Congratulations on falling asleep.
[341.59s -> 343.11s]  Welcome to Somnascult.
[343.11s -> 346.31s]  Your progress may be monitored by qualified specialists.
[347.11s -> 349.67s]  This orientation will adapt you to eyelids,
[349.67s -> 352.23s]  our interactive lucid induction dream state
[352.23s -> 355.27s]  in which you retain full consciousness and control.
[355.27s -> 359.16s]  What do you want me to do?
[359.16s -> 365.64s]  Move this?
[365.64s -> 373.83s]  Oh, fuck. What do I do?
[373.83s -> 376.25s]  What? Wait, what?
[376.25s -> 381.32s]  I don't get it. What just happened?
[381.32s -> 389.19s]  What? Okay.
[389.19s -> 398.34s]  What do I, do I have to play chess?
[398.34s -> 400.09s]  Okay, put the board here.
[400.09s -> 401.13s]  No, that's too small.
[401.13s -> 406.74s]  Um, oh, that's huge.
[406.74s -> 407.62s]  Do I have to make this big?
[408.02s -> 440.68s]  Oh, I thought I had to play chess.
[440.68s -> 451.16s]  Shit. It's okay. That works.
[451.16s -> 453.48s]  No objects beyond this point at all times.
[453.48s -> 510.25s]  How do I make it big?
[510.25s -> 511.37s]  Make it look big.
[511.37s -> 519.75s]  Can I like hold it up to my eye?
[520.39s -> 522.07s]  How do I hold it up to my eye?
[522.07s -> 523.78s]  Well, that's gone now.
[523.78s -> 525.94s]  I broke the game and I have to restart the whole thing.
[525.94s -> 526.74s]  Thank God.
[526.74s -> 531.45s]  How do I, how do I hold it up close?
[531.45s -> 532.33s]  Distance. Yeah.
[532.33s -> 533.21s]  Can I crouch?
[533.21s -> 563.13s]  Is there a way I can pull it forward to look at it closer?
[563.13s -> 572.70s]  Whoa. Well, now what?
[572.70s -> 574.30s]  What do I do? How, what do I do about it?
[574.30s -> 575.62s]  How do I get it in there?
[575.62s -> 580.58s]  From the vent?
[580.58s -> 582.25s]  How do I get it through? I can't.
[582.25s -> 583.53s]  How do I put it? Just go through?
[583.53s -> 585.11s]  I thought I couldn't.
[585.11s -> 585.99s]  Wait, I'm confused.
[587.75s -> 589.03s]  I can't bring this through.
[589.03s -> 590.15s]  So how do I put it here?
[590.15s -> 596.30s]  Put it in the vent?
[596.30s -> 598.60s]  Yeah, I can't go through the block.
[598.60s -> 606.89s]  So how do I get the, how do I get the block in here?
[606.89s -> 607.61s]  Is there a vent?
[637.94s -> 658.33s]  Oh, sneaky.
[658.33s -> 663.51s]  Shit. Hold on.
[663.51s -> 672.46s]  No, I want it to be smaller.
[672.46s -> 673.34s]  Confirmed.
[673.34s -> 676.38s]  You can move freely, interact with surrounding objects,
[676.38s -> 679.26s]  and listen to messages from your patient care team.
[679.26s -> 682.76s]  Please note that I am the standard orientation protocol
[682.76s -> 685.88s]  and that my voice has been explicitly chosen to remind you
[685.88s -> 688.90s]  that I am not a part of your patient care team.
[688.90s -> 692.41s]  I do not care.
[692.41s -> 693.37s]  Whoa, it's big. All right.
[693.37s -> 694.81s]  So now just go through here.
[694.81s -> 712.44s]  Dude, smoke is coming out of his ears.
[712.44s -> 731.51s]  Hold. Okay.
[731.51s -> 733.26s]  Oh, this is huge.
[733.26s -> 752.17s]  Wow. Oh, is that it?
[752.17s -> 756.82s]  Yeah, kind of.
[756.82s -> 760.18s]  During eyelids, you will lose the ability to awaken suddenly
[760.18s -> 762.68s]  due to realizing that this is a dream.
[762.68s -> 766.28s]  Evidence. I have already informed you that this is a dream.
[766.28s -> 767.56s]  You did not wake up.
[768.14s -> 771.26s]  Please complete the remaining orientation activities.
[771.26s -> 775.29s]  I feel like I'm going to...
[778.84s -> 780.20s]  All right. So what am I doing here?
[780.20s -> 786.62s]  This has got to be a dream soda.
[786.62s -> 790.46s]  Warning. You have deviated from the orientation pathway.
[790.46s -> 793.34s]  At the Pierce Institute, patient safety as a keynote...
[793.34s -> 794.46s]  We're going to every floor.
[795.74s -> 798.70s]  A variable degree of force cannon will be authorized
[798.70s -> 800.71s]  to ensure patient safety.
[800.71s -> 803.03s]  Please return to the orientation pathway.
[809.62s -> 818.26s]  Oh, that's a tiny little button.
[818.26s -> 836.86s]  All right. How do I make it teeny tiny?
[836.86s -> 838.06s]  I got to go like this, right?
[838.06s -> 848.73s]  Like, cool.
[848.73s -> 860.31s]  Looks like somebody tried to...
[874.76s -> 898.25s]  I mean, probably just like through here, right?
[898.25s -> 901.75s]  Yeah.
[901.75s -> 904.07s]  All environments perceived during eyelids
[904.07s -> 906.31s]  should reflect a typical mental state.
[906.31s -> 909.75s]  If you believe your mental state was compromised by somnascope,
[909.75s -> 912.63s]  please provide a comprehensive, rational explanation
[912.63s -> 914.87s]  in your post-procedural survey.
[914.87s -> 920.12s]  Completed surveys may be eligible for a gift card.
[920.12s -> 928.68s]  Oh, whoops. Can I put this?
[928.68s -> 930.60s]  No. I got to throw it over there at the top.
[938.58s -> 940.74s]  I'm getting the hang of it. I understand it.
[940.74s -> 947.19s]  The mold must have rotted his brain.
[947.19s -> 947.91s]  I'm fine.
[947.91s -> 950.73s]  I just did that faster than probably all of you combined.
[950.73s -> 968.76s]  What the hell is going on?
[968.76s -> 994.17s]  How do I get out of here?
[994.17s -> 995.77s]  Whoa. All right. Hold on.
[995.77s -> 998.17s]  I don't know how I can pick this up.
[998.17s -> 1032.52s]  I'm too high for this?
[1032.52s -> 1033.51s]  Well, relax.
[1033.51s -> 1035.27s]  Please stand by for polite recognition
[1035.27s -> 1038.57s]  on your completion of the somnascope orientation.
[1038.57s -> 1039.83s]  You did it.
[1039.83s -> 1043.11s]  To maximize the time allotted for your therapeutic journey,
[1043.11s -> 1047.19s]  please do not delay in proceeding through the final doorway as indicated.
[1047.19s -> 1047.83s]  Final doorway.
[1047.83s -> 1049.27s]  We're going to get some portal type shit.
[1049.27s -> 1049.99s]  Watch this.
[1049.99s -> 1095.86s]  I don't get it.
[1095.86s -> 1097.93s]  I feel like I could grab something through here.
[1097.93s -> 1101.94s]  Can't pick up the sign.
[1101.94s -> 1111.90s]  I would imagine it would be the boxes right here.
[1111.90s -> 1120.18s]  No. I can't grab the speaker.
[1120.18s -> 1127.43s]  Sprinkler. No speaker.
[1127.43s -> 1131.38s]  I can't grab the bricks.
[1131.38s -> 1168.60s]  It's not something out here, right?
[1168.60s -> 1169.32s]  Cheese.
[1169.32s -> 1187.82s]  Oh my god. That emote is fucked up looking.
[1194.14s -> 1195.18s]  Can I knock it over?
[1195.18s -> 1199.56s]  This thing?
[1199.56s -> 1201.08s]  Oh, all right.
[1201.08s -> 1202.28s]  This thing's big and heavy.
[1202.28s -> 1203.40s]  What about the other ones?
[1203.40s -> 1204.92s]  There's a couple more I can do this to probably, right?
[1204.92s -> 1210.63s]  There's one more over here.
[1211.19s -> 1214.92s]  No. All right.
[1214.92s -> 1215.72s]  So what's through here?
[1215.72s -> 1242.68s]  Can't pick anything up.
[1242.68s -> 1244.60s]  Chills. This game is fucking scary.
[1244.60s -> 1261.62s]  Is this pretty?
[1261.62s -> 1262.26s]  This is cool.
[1262.26s -> 1273.69s]  3 a.m.
[1273.69s -> 1275.85s]  That's the Satan hour, isn't it?
[1275.85s -> 1276.73s]  Satan hour.
[1276.73s -> 1283.54s]  Sweet B.
[1284.50s -> 1285.14s]  Okay.
[1285.14s -> 1291.45s]  Private.
[1291.45s -> 1303.72s]  It's like, why am I coughing?
[1303.72s -> 1306.20s]  All right.
[1306.20s -> 1308.76s]  Is this like a Hearthstone game board or does this matter?
[1308.76s -> 1311.40s]  Or is it just me going like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom.
[1311.40s -> 1312.76s]  And then something happens for a second.
[1312.76s -> 1330.23s]  This is a new contract.
[1330.23s -> 1337.46s]  No need a contract signed and sealed.
[1337.46s -> 1339.02s]  What if it happened?
[1339.02s -> 1341.66s]  You may think it all would be a bad dream.
[1345.27s -> 1357.37s]  Big can.
[1357.37s -> 1359.69s]  Some doors are best left closed.
[1359.69s -> 1385.80s]  I feel like I won this at the fair and it's a huge pain in the ass to get back to my hotel room.
[1385.80s -> 1386.60s]  Oh, yeah, honey.
[1386.60s -> 1387.88s]  You won me the big soda.
[1387.88s -> 1389.40s]  And like, yeah, can we just donate this?
[1390.20s -> 1391.08s]  I don't want this.
[1391.08s -> 1394.57s]  How are we going to bring this on the airplane?
[1394.57s -> 1399.11s]  Well, we're going to want to check this.
[1399.11s -> 1410.02s]  We need to give this to someone.
[1410.02s -> 1410.34s]  Whoa.
[1410.34s -> 1410.90s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[1410.90s -> 1436.49s]  It's doing the it's doing the Super Mario thing.
[1436.49s -> 1437.69s]  Um, all right.
[1437.69s -> 1439.40s]  Let's just leave.
[1439.40s -> 1441.06s]  Oh, my God.
[1457.93s -> 1461.94s]  I don't know if I can play this.
[1461.94s -> 1463.22s]  What the fuck?
[1463.22s -> 1463.86s]  What is that?
[1465.05s -> 1468.97s]  What?
[1468.97s -> 1470.41s]  Oh, it's an object.
[1470.41s -> 1471.29s]  That's weird.
[1471.29s -> 1471.85s]  All right.
[1471.85s -> 1502.31s]  Look, it's an exit.
[1502.31s -> 1515.82s]  Um, I jump over this.
[1515.82s -> 1516.46s]  Yeah.
[1516.46s -> 1529.88s]  Tip that way.
[1529.88s -> 1546.07s]  Come on.
[1546.07s -> 1546.71s]  Tip.
[1546.71s -> 1559.16s]  Oh, my goodness.
[1559.16s -> 1559.96s]  That's huge.
[1559.96s -> 1560.52s]  Okay.
[1560.52s -> 1561.32s]  That's all right.
[1561.32s -> 1583.37s]  Bingo.
[1583.37s -> 1588.86s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and I'd like to talk to you about being special.
[1588.86s -> 1593.37s]  So special, in fact, that we have no idea where you are.
[1593.37s -> 1595.34s]  But not to worry.
[1595.34s -> 1599.26s]  We're working on it.
[1599.26s -> 1599.50s]  Okay.
[1599.50s -> 1599.98s]  Bye.
[1599.98s -> 1615.02s]  Does it matter what door I go in?
[1615.10s -> 1615.50s]  Whoa.
[1615.50s -> 1615.82s]  Wait.
[1615.82s -> 1632.22s]  Hold on.
[1632.22s -> 1632.62s]  Whoa.
[1632.62s -> 1634.12s]  That was fun.
[1634.12s -> 1634.84s]  Cool.
[1634.84s -> 1638.54s]  What do I do with this?
[1638.54s -> 1658.33s]  Oh, my God.
[1658.33s -> 1661.11s]  I made it.
[1661.11s -> 1663.11s]  He doesn't think this game is that fun.
[1663.11s -> 1663.35s]  What?
[1663.35s -> 1663.99s]  What are you talking about?
[1663.99s -> 1664.87s]  How do you know that?
[1664.87s -> 1670.33s]  I didn't say that.
[1670.33s -> 1680.78s]  Why are you saying that?
[1680.78s -> 1681.02s]  All right.
[1681.02s -> 1681.82s]  I'm back to constant.
[1681.82s -> 1683.02s]  I'm concentrating.
[1683.02s -> 1685.86s]  This game requires a lot of thought.
[1685.86s -> 1689.16s]  No, I can't.
[1689.16s -> 1692.92s]  I can't rant about the shitty ice cream that I am.
[1692.92s -> 1693.24s]  I can't.
[1693.24s -> 1693.80s]  I can't.
[1693.80s -> 1696.15s]  No.
[1696.15s -> 1696.63s]  You want that?
[1696.63s -> 1699.26s]  We should have stayed in the other game.
[1699.26s -> 1701.50s]  I have to pay attention.
[1701.50s -> 1703.98s]  His eyes are glazing over.
[1703.98s -> 1708.71s]  I can't.
[1708.71s -> 1709.59s]  All right.
[1709.59s -> 1712.22s]  This doesn't make me like a moron.
[1712.22s -> 1713.51s]  Somebody explain it.
[1713.51s -> 1713.75s]  OK.
[1713.75s -> 1716.34s]  Tell me if this makes me a moron.
[1716.34s -> 1718.97s]  This music is nice.
[1718.97s -> 1722.63s]  I enjoy this, but I could never listen to this.
[1725.02s -> 1726.94s]  It's too high functioning for me.
[1726.94s -> 1730.58s]  It's almost like I don't like it.
[1730.58s -> 1731.62s]  It doesn't make me.
[1731.62s -> 1732.66s]  It's like too much for me.
[1736.84s -> 1742.89s]  This kind of music is almost like an instrumental telling a story.
[1742.89s -> 1743.37s]  Right?
[1743.37s -> 1749.72s]  That's how a lot of jazz and instrument, right?
[1749.72s -> 1752.62s]  It's like kind of telling a story without any lyrics.
[1752.62s -> 1757.16s]  It's just a piano.
[1757.16s -> 1758.60s]  Piano kind of tells the story.
[1758.60s -> 1768.90s]  You guys know what I mean by that, right?
[1768.90s -> 1771.22s]  You played the Hatsune Miku game on stream.
[1771.22s -> 1782.63s]  But there's a huge difference between like bopey, bopey, bopey, bopey, bow.
[1782.63s -> 1784.87s]  I can just sit there and like, yay.
[1787.14s -> 1789.06s]  And I don't listen to Hatsune Miku.
[1789.06s -> 1792.76s]  I don't.
[1792.76s -> 1794.04s]  This is wonderful.
[1794.04s -> 1799.05s]  This is the kind of music that I could just, you know,
[1799.05s -> 1801.11s]  have like two fingers of whiskey.
[1801.11s -> 1805.08s]  Just be like, yeah, yeah, I'm smart like you.
[1805.08s -> 1806.92s]  Clink it around.
[1807.64s -> 1809.85s]  Just go like this.
[1809.85s -> 1816.25s]  Two fingers.
[1816.25s -> 1817.37s]  Yes, two fingers of whiskey.
[1817.37s -> 1818.09s]  That's what they call it.
[1818.09s -> 1820.84s]  Is the amount of fingers tall.
[1820.84s -> 1821.56s]  The beverages.
[1824.57s -> 1827.53s]  Hey, I'll take four fingers of whiskey.
[1827.53s -> 1829.69s]  It's like, whoa, dude, settle down.
[1829.69s -> 1831.64s]  No, two fingers.
[1831.64s -> 1832.28s]  Settle down.
[1832.28s -> 1833.24s]  You don't need four.
[1833.24s -> 1836.25s]  Hey, I'll take the whole hand.
[1836.25s -> 1852.95s]  I don't think I've ever heard of ordering four fingers of whiskey.
[1852.95s -> 1863.08s]  Anyways, should I leak a stream idea?
[1863.08s -> 1864.54s]  I think it might be funny.
[1864.54s -> 1866.14s]  No, what if I just do it one day?
[1866.14s -> 1867.98s]  But who cares?
[1867.98s -> 1868.62s]  What if I don't?
[1868.62s -> 1874.84s]  Do I have to connect this somehow?
[1874.84s -> 1879.16s]  What did that do?
[1879.16s -> 1882.36s]  Oh, neat.
[1882.36s -> 1890.34s]  Oh, there we go.
[1890.34s -> 1903.29s]  What the hell is going on here?
[1903.29s -> 1912.70s]  Did we forget that?
[1912.70s -> 1913.98s]  No, it's not a whiskey stream.
[1913.98s -> 1914.70s]  Something else.
[1914.70s -> 1921.30s]  God, dude.
[1921.30s -> 1925.45s]  Good enough.
[1925.45s -> 1931.30s]  This is way too dank.
[1931.30s -> 1932.02s]  Should I turn it down?
[1948.39s -> 1954.47s]  It's all about perspective.
[1954.47s -> 1955.59s]  It's all about perspective.
[1955.59s -> 2009.29s]  I don't get it.
[2009.29s -> 2011.13s]  Wait, this is not one of those things here.
[2011.13s -> 2011.69s]  OK.
[2011.69s -> 2016.66s]  Bartender stream?
[2016.66s -> 2017.06s]  No.
[2017.06s -> 2022.60s]  What the hell do I do with this?
[2022.60s -> 2023.80s]  Oh, I know what to do.
[2023.80s -> 2035.29s]  Watch this.
[2035.29s -> 2035.61s]  Really?
[2036.17s -> 2037.61s]  Reception is reality.
[2037.61s -> 2038.09s]  Yeah.
[2038.09s -> 2059.96s]  You can hire?
[2059.96s -> 2096.23s]  Hey, what the fuck?
[2096.23s -> 2101.61s]  Jerry.
[2101.61s -> 2107.90s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'm just popping in to give you a quick update on where you are.
[2107.90s -> 2114.73s]  We still don't know, but please keep moving forward, and hopefully you prefer frequent
[2114.73s -> 2118.41s]  updates to being reminded that you are completely lost.
[2118.41s -> 2121.91s]  Look at that one out.
[2121.91s -> 2122.47s]  Doc.
[2122.47s -> 2148.22s]  Bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo peep.
[2148.22s -> 2153.10s]  Oh shit.
[2153.10s -> 2162.02s]  OK, cool.
[2162.02s -> 2163.22s]  This is a cool game.
[2163.22s -> 2164.38s]  I like it.
[2164.38s -> 2165.26s]  It's just pretty chill.
[2165.26s -> 2165.91s]  It's fun.
[2165.91s -> 2167.27s]  It's a interesting mechanic.
[2167.27s -> 2169.98s]  I like it.
[2169.98s -> 2171.85s]  I like it.
[2171.85s -> 2175.67s]  All right.
[2175.67s -> 2176.79s]  Can I do anything here?
[2176.79s -> 2183.26s]  I guess not.
[2183.26s -> 2187.03s]  Hello.
[2187.03s -> 2190.39s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and we still can't find you.
[2190.65s -> 2196.01s]  But you should now have access to a series of elevators that should trigger your subconscious
[2196.01s -> 2198.60s]  to gradually wake you up.
[2198.60s -> 2203.48s]  You should also find a variety of emergency exit signs that should lead you to them.
[2204.04s -> 2205.00s]  Will all of this work?
[2205.72s -> 2207.00s]  Absolutely.
[2207.00s -> 2210.95s]  Oh, I did it.
[2210.95s -> 2211.27s]  I did it.
[2211.27s -> 2216.20s]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[2216.20s -> 2217.32s]  This game is mid.
[2217.32s -> 2218.44s]  When did I say that?
[2218.44s -> 2219.48s]  I didn't say that at all.
[2220.12s -> 2221.24s]  Give it a seven.
[2221.24s -> 2224.22s]  Why does everybody think I'm going to give this thing a six?
[2224.22s -> 2226.07s]  I'm not going to give it a seven.
[2226.07s -> 2228.17s]  I'm not going to give this game a six.
[2228.17s -> 2229.21s]  Why is everybody?
[2229.21s -> 2232.10s]  Everyone's just like, oh, my God, I can't wait.
[2232.10s -> 2234.10s]  He's going to say like, oh, the game sucks.
[2234.10s -> 2234.98s]  It's like kind of bad.
[2234.98s -> 2236.66s]  He's going to give it a 6.5.
[2236.66s -> 2238.23s]  Why is everybody waiting for that?
[2238.23s -> 2239.43s]  No, it's a fun game.
[2239.43s -> 2244.02s]  Just grab the moon.
[2244.02s -> 2255.70s]  What is all over the moon?
[2255.70s -> 2257.46s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[2257.46s -> 2261.59s]  The event that this elevator does not wake you up.
[2261.59s -> 2266.54s]  Please don't interact with anything that strikes you as psychologically significant,
[2266.54s -> 2270.14s]  as we will no longer have any way of controlling it.
[2270.14s -> 2270.86s]  He's toxic.
[2270.86s -> 2272.06s]  He hates everything.
[2272.06s -> 2276.30s]  If you see your parents, please punch them in the face as hard as you can
[2276.30s -> 2278.30s]  and immediately run away.
[2278.30s -> 2279.91s]  Put that back.
[2279.91s -> 2280.95s]  Put the moon back?
[2280.95s -> 2281.67s]  I don't think I can.
[2295.21s -> 2295.45s]  All right.
[2295.45s -> 2296.09s]  So this is wood.
[2296.09s -> 2299.08s]  So how do I get by the wood?
[2299.08s -> 2300.44s]  Remember, pay attention.
[2300.44s -> 2301.88s]  Perspective is everything.
[2301.88s -> 2307.06s]  What is this?
[2307.06s -> 2308.15s]  Pizza?
[2308.15s -> 2311.11s]  Cheese?
[2311.11s -> 2311.43s]  All right.
[2311.43s -> 2311.75s]  Hold on.
[2311.75s -> 2313.14s]  I can build.
[2313.14s -> 2314.50s]  Do I have to climb out of here?
[2314.50s -> 2341.85s]  Dude, I have to climb out of here.
[2341.85s -> 2342.73s]  Oh, no, I don't.
[2342.73s -> 2353.16s]  Thought I had to climb out.
[2353.16s -> 2354.12s]  Don't get lost.
[2354.12s -> 2355.48s]  What if there's a fire?
[2355.48s -> 2358.47s]  Regular beer fund, five dollars.
[2358.47s -> 2360.55s]  35 dreams per night.
[2360.63s -> 2362.09s]  What if there's a fire in an elevator?
[2362.09s -> 2364.01s]  Don't meet sister-in-law.
[2364.01s -> 2366.06s]  Don't get lost.
[2366.06s -> 2370.15s]  Wait, should I take one of the signs?
[2370.15s -> 2370.63s]  Ah, fuck it.
[2370.63s -> 2371.03s]  Whatever.
[2371.03s -> 2383.43s]  Why am I so small?
[2383.43s -> 2384.31s]  Five dollars for beer?
[2384.31s -> 2392.38s]  Yeah, that seems a little incorrect.
[2392.38s -> 2393.34s]  4 a.m. now.
[2393.34s -> 2406.38s]  Okay.
[2406.38s -> 2410.86s]  So I was really looking to see if there's anything off.
[2410.86s -> 2416.60s]  Guy, it's sort of gross.
[2416.60s -> 2419.00s]  Baking soda?
[2419.00s -> 2419.80s]  Green soda?
[2419.80s -> 2421.24s]  I probably would like that one.
[2421.24s -> 2423.62s]  Red soda, probably.
[2423.62s -> 2424.82s]  Water soda?
[2424.82s -> 2425.22s]  No.
[2425.22s -> 2425.70s]  No, thanks.
[2425.70s -> 2426.34s]  It's gross.
[2426.34s -> 2429.26s]  It just tastes like just air.
[2429.26s -> 2433.14s]  It's a weird burp air.
[2433.38s -> 2436.70s]  Okay, do anybody here drink soda water?
[2436.70s -> 2438.38s]  You're just drinking burp air.
[2439.98s -> 2446.07s]  Nobody drinks soda water, right?
[2446.07s -> 2450.68s]  I don't even like the seltzers.
[2450.68s -> 2454.92s]  Okay, every time I drink a seltzer, I take a sip.
[2454.92s -> 2456.68s]  It's like, ooh, that's kind of nice.
[2456.68s -> 2460.63s]  And then I get this weird pop rocks kind of at the end.
[2460.63s -> 2463.54s]  And it just tastes like fucking gross chemicals.
[2463.54s -> 2465.62s]  No, none of them ever tasted good to me.
[2465.62s -> 2469.88s]  It's just, I don't like it.
[2469.88s -> 2474.63s]  You know what I wish they would really make?
[2474.63s -> 2475.83s]  Have I talked about this yet?
[2475.83s -> 2478.12s]  What was that?
[2478.12s -> 2486.42s]  It was a scary noise.
[2486.42s -> 2490.26s]  I wish they would make soda that was 60% less sugar.
[2490.26s -> 2491.54s]  This is an automated message for all patients
[2491.54s -> 2493.70s]  who attempted to use an alternate pathway
[2493.70s -> 2496.58s]  to access the next phase of somnasculp therapy,
[2496.58s -> 2499.78s]  but who have become trapped in a dream state paradox instead.
[2500.34s -> 2503.14s]  Your decisions imply a failure of orientation,
[2503.14s -> 2506.98s]  which reflects negatively on the standard orientation protocol.
[2506.98s -> 2507.46s]  What is this?
[2507.46s -> 2509.62s]  You will rectify this failure immediately.
[2512.71s -> 2514.39s]  No, I don't want diet soda.
[2514.39s -> 2516.94s]  I just want less sugar soda.
[2516.94s -> 2519.98s]  Diet soda is, oh, there's no sugar in it.
[2519.98s -> 2522.14s]  It tastes like fucking chemicals and stuff.
[2522.14s -> 2524.30s]  And it's got aspartame.
[2524.30s -> 2529.70s]  No, no, no, I just want like 15 grams of sugar in my Coke.
[2529.70s -> 2533.54s]  I don't want to drink zero sugar diet soda.
[2533.54s -> 2534.98s]  I just want less sugar.
[2534.98s -> 2538.94s]  Just put sugar in your diet soda.
[2538.94s -> 2543.83s]  No, because it already has that gross weird diet soda sweetener.
[2543.83s -> 2547.90s]  Just drink water, dude.
[2547.90s -> 2552.41s]  Just hold on.
[2552.41s -> 2555.22s]  That's actually kind of a funny solution, but it's not accurate.
[2555.22s -> 2558.68s]  Somebody said just put water in your soda.
[2558.68s -> 2560.20s]  So if I buy a 12 ounce,
[2560.20s -> 2565.46s]  if I have a 12 ounce can of Coca-Cola and I dilute it by 50% with water,
[2565.46s -> 2567.38s]  I mess up all the other ingredients.
[2567.38s -> 2570.33s]  That's not going to work.
[2570.33s -> 2574.49s]  There are flavorings and other stuff in Coke and Pepsi and whatever.
[2574.49s -> 2576.01s]  That's not just sugar.
[2576.01s -> 2578.76s]  You'd be diluting all the other stuff.
[2578.76s -> 2583.00s]  I want the same syrup ratio, but I want 50% less sugar.
[2583.00s -> 2588.49s]  Take your own soda on SodaStream.
[2588.49s -> 2589.69s]  Just drink half your soda.
[2589.69s -> 2594.34s]  No, it's the same sweetness level.
[2594.34s -> 2595.38s]  Add soda water.
[2595.38s -> 2599.86s]  No, it would mess it up.
[2599.86s -> 2601.14s]  What are you, a chemist?
[2601.14s -> 2608.33s]  SodaStream might actually be the solution.
[2608.33s -> 2608.57s]  What?
[2608.57s -> 2608.81s]  Okay.
[2608.81s -> 2614.10s]  Is the SodaStream Coca-Cola ripoff a gross Coca-Cola ripoff or does it taste okay?
[2614.10s -> 2628.60s]  I feel like I know what it tastes like.
[2628.60s -> 2629.32s]  It's pretty bad.
[2629.32s -> 2630.28s]  It's okay.
[2630.28s -> 2631.26s]  It's bad.
[2631.26s -> 2631.58s]  It's bad.
[2631.58s -> 2632.06s]  It's pretty good.
[2632.06s -> 2632.86s]  It's okay.
[2632.86s -> 2633.26s]  I don't know.
[2633.26s -> 2634.14s]  It's okay.
[2634.14s -> 2639.16s]  All right.
[2639.16s -> 2640.68s]  I can't pick up anything here.
[2640.68s -> 2653.32s]  Just drink Pepsi instead.
[2653.32s -> 2659.34s]  I don't really like Pepsi.
[2659.34s -> 2661.86s]  Pepsi has a weird taste.
[2661.86s -> 2662.98s]  It's almost too much.
[2662.98s -> 2663.70s]  I don't like it.
[2663.70s -> 2667.45s]  I think Coke is way better.
[2667.85s -> 2668.09s]  Okay.
[2668.09s -> 2676.04s]  If you took Coke Starlight, if you took fucking Starlight, kid, and you reduced the sugar
[2676.04s -> 2680.33s]  by like 25%, that would be the best soda I've probably ever made.
[2680.33s -> 2683.58s]  How do I get that?
[2683.58s -> 2690.89s]  There's something on the bottom of that.
[2690.89s -> 2698.33s]  Can I look at the bottom?
[2698.33s -> 2702.63s]  Starlight is good.
[2702.63s -> 2703.75s]  Starlight was very good.
[2708.20s -> 2710.28s]  Stop making all these other stupid things.
[2710.28s -> 2714.23s]  Oh, light.
[2715.03s -> 2715.67s]  All right.
[2715.67s -> 2717.51s]  Should I go down here?
[2717.51s -> 2719.21s]  All right.
[2719.21s -> 2719.69s]  I'm confused.
[2719.69s -> 2720.81s]  Let's go down here with the light.
[2720.81s -> 2739.54s]  All right.
[2739.54s -> 2742.42s]  It's the chess piece and chess board.
[2745.83s -> 2749.45s]  Guess I'm going to go this way.
[2749.45s -> 2753.78s]  Professional tip.
[2753.78s -> 2758.15s]  The average adult can only withstand three to five dreams per night.
[2758.15s -> 2761.27s]  Once this threshold is eclipsed by entering more dreams,
[2761.27s -> 2764.07s]  your mind will suffer an explosive mental overload,
[2764.07s -> 2766.95s]  reorienting you for the emergency exit protocol.
[2766.95s -> 2767.75s]  No, I could feel that.
[2767.75s -> 2771.88s]  Please subject yourself to explosive mental overload.
[2771.88s -> 2775.51s]  No, I could feel that for sure.
[2775.51s -> 2776.15s]  Whoa.
[2776.15s -> 2776.47s]  All right.
[2776.47s -> 2777.35s]  This looks weird.
[2777.35s -> 2782.95s]  Can I pick that up?
[2782.95s -> 2794.39s]  No, I want that, boy.
[2794.39s -> 2799.32s]  All right.
[2799.32s -> 2799.88s]  Yeah.
[2799.88s -> 2801.00s]  I don't hate Pepsi.
[2801.00s -> 2802.28s]  I just don't prefer it.
[2802.28s -> 2814.62s]  I used to love Dr. Pepper, but that got a little too much too.
[2815.40s -> 2816.84s]  Your tastes change when you get older.
[2816.84s -> 2818.28s]  They really do.
[2818.28s -> 2820.28s]  Anybody that doesn't agree with that is...
[2820.28s -> 2820.84s]  I don't...
[2820.84s -> 2821.24s]  I...
[2821.24s -> 2824.50s]  Okay.
[2824.50s -> 2824.90s]  Hold on.
[2838.94s -> 2845.58s]  I guess that's okay.
[2845.58s -> 2851.27s]  Okay.
[2851.27s -> 2854.15s]  Please note that a reluctance to volunteer for the risks
[2854.15s -> 2858.07s]  associated with explosive mental overload implies a misunderstanding
[2858.07s -> 2861.91s]  of all other solutions, all of which are far more traumatic and likelier.
[2861.91s -> 2863.62s]  That's kind of loud.
[2863.62s -> 2864.63s]  You're right.
[2864.63s -> 2866.23s]  Nobody said that, but I said it for you.
[2866.23s -> 2869.90s]  ...to result in catastrophe.
[2869.90s -> 2873.02s]  I am not capable of suboptimal suggestions.
[2873.02s -> 2875.34s]  Please exit this dream as soon as possible.
[2876.30s -> 2877.10s]  Whoa.
[2877.10s -> 2878.46s]  There's a rubber ducky in here.
[2878.46s -> 2885.11s]  What can I do with this?
[2915.48s -> 2915.88s]  All right.
[2915.88s -> 2916.36s]  That's fine.
[2918.82s -> 2919.06s]  Yeah.
[2919.06s -> 2920.02s]  Starlight was the best.
[2921.93s -> 2922.57s]  God damn it.
[2922.57s -> 2922.97s]  Okay.
[2922.97s -> 2923.45s]  Well, whatever.
[2923.45s -> 2941.43s]  Just...
[2941.43s -> 2945.70s]  Hey, if it works, you need to worry about it.
[2945.70s -> 2946.42s]  Anything else?
[2946.42s -> 2950.44s]  Whoa.
[2950.44s -> 2953.22s]  Jesus.
[2953.22s -> 2953.62s]  Okay.
[2953.62s -> 2955.22s]  Well, how many of these do I need?
[2955.22s -> 2960.63s]  A few?
[2960.63s -> 2988.31s]  Are they good enough?
[2988.31s -> 2988.63s]  Yeah.
[3004.04s -> 3011.18s]  Did I do it wrong?
[3011.18s -> 3015.22s]  I don't think so.
[3015.22s -> 3016.10s]  I don't think I did it right.
[3016.10s -> 3023.50s]  Oh, moka ee.
[3023.50s -> 3029.14s]  casino.
[3029.14s -> 3036.17s]  If you love Hatsune Miku, wish her a happy birthday, then.
[3053.05s -> 3060.30s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[3060.30s -> 3063.02s]  And despite touring the Waterfall Serenity Zone
[3063.02s -> 3065.50s]  in the previous section you've just completed,
[3065.50s -> 3068.94s]  you may still be experiencing feelings of worthlessness
[3068.94s -> 3070.14s]  and self-doubt.
[3070.14s -> 3071.18s]  Happy birthday, Miku!
[3071.18s -> 3072.78s]  So I feel like everything is going...
[3072.78s -> 3073.66s]  From me, Jeremy.
[3073.66s -> 3091.67s]  ...even when the sun is shining.
[3091.67s -> 3102.20s]  Seven days late, by the way.
[3102.20s -> 3103.72s]  Within seven days is fine.
[3103.72s -> 3107.10s]  I don't think that's a problem.
[3107.82s -> 3123.27s]  I'm just waiting for the Cleric Beast sound
[3123.27s -> 3159.94s]  that they use in all the Souls games.
[3159.94s -> 3160.90s]  Meat freezer?
[3160.98s -> 3167.90s]  A lot of Bloodborne references today.
[3167.90s -> 3170.49s]  Yeah, I'm a very simple person.
[3172.34s -> 3176.63s]  Whatever I'm referencing the most on a given day,
[3176.63s -> 3178.63s]  you better bet your ass that that's the thing
[3178.63s -> 3180.63s]  that I've been consuming for the last week or two.
[3180.63s -> 3183.16s]  So if for some reason you start getting
[3183.16s -> 3184.92s]  a bunch of Breaking Bad references,
[3184.92s -> 3186.92s]  I'm currently watching Breaking Bad.
[3186.92s -> 3192.94s]  It's just everything lives up here for about two weeks
[3192.94s -> 3195.61s]  and then goes away forever.
[3195.61s -> 3198.89s]  Yeah, like Eren, I was watching Attack on Titan.
[3198.89s -> 3199.45s]  Yeah.
[3199.45s -> 3201.77s]  I think it was at one point when I was talking about
[3201.77s -> 3205.22s]  having quirks from My Hero Academia.
[3205.22s -> 3206.26s]  And I watched like...
[3206.26s -> 3208.74s]  I think I watched like six episodes of that whole show.
[3208.74s -> 3218.14s]  And I was just like, ah, never mind.
[3218.14s -> 3220.57s]  You should watch more. It's good.
[3220.57s -> 3221.69s]  That's six too many.
[3221.69s -> 3222.25s]  I...
[3222.25s -> 3222.81s]  This Blood...
[3222.81s -> 3223.29s]  Wait, hold on.
[3223.29s -> 3226.17s]  This Blood on the Ground in this fucking PG Disney game.
[3226.17s -> 3227.74s]  It's just this...
[3227.74s -> 3228.94s]  Wait, the Disney didn't make this,
[3228.94s -> 3231.86s]  but you know what I mean?
[3231.86s -> 3232.82s]  Wait, what the hell is going...
[3233.38s -> 3238.42s]  This is a scary game, is it?
[3238.42s -> 3239.54s]  Is this a scary game?
[3239.54s -> 3240.50s]  What the fuck happened?
[3240.50s -> 3243.16s]  I thought this was a fun puzzle game.
[3243.16s -> 3249.50s]  Is this a scary game?
[3249.50s -> 3251.50s]  Okay, I was not ready for a scary game tonight,
[3251.50s -> 3252.30s]  but whatever.
[3252.30s -> 3264.79s]  Why is it Blood Murder?
[3273.22s -> 3277.80s]  I want to play a game where I just have a big wrench
[3277.80s -> 3279.58s]  as a melee weapon and that's it.
[3279.58s -> 3281.42s]  And you get like two attacks.
[3281.42s -> 3284.86s]  Just like wild swing, wild overhead swing.
[3284.86s -> 3289.27s]  Don't you think it'd be so fun with scary monsters and stuff?
[3289.27s -> 3290.15s]  That's Half-Life 2.
[3290.15s -> 3290.95s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[3292.95s -> 3295.61s]  I already played Condemned.
[3295.61s -> 3301.26s]  Yeah, I kind of want another Condemned
[3301.26s -> 3304.14s]  where I just have a wrench or a pipe in my hand and that's it.
[3304.14s -> 3309.03s]  So what do I do here?
[3309.03s -> 3321.29s]  Cry of Fear.
[3321.29s -> 3322.41s]  I played Cry of Fear.
[3322.41s -> 3323.98s]  Posing Force.
[3323.98s -> 3325.34s]  I feel like I played that too.
[3325.34s -> 3328.07s]  Okay, I obviously don't know what's going on.
[3328.07s -> 3343.42s]  So one of the lights up here, the door handles, the lights.
[3343.42s -> 3344.54s]  I can't pick anything up.
[3344.54s -> 3358.76s]  I don't get it.
[3358.76s -> 3418.73s]  You should play Bioshock.
[3418.73s -> 3442.68s]  I die, die, die.
[3442.68s -> 3444.98s]  Almost got me.
[3444.98s -> 3446.94s]  Almost.
[3446.94s -> 3447.90s]  Nice try though.
[3447.90s -> 3459.27s]  I applaud your effort.
[3459.27s -> 3459.77s]  Whoops.
[3460.63s -> 3461.35s]  It's scripted.
[3461.35s -> 3462.39s]  It's scripted, it's scripted.
[3462.39s -> 3469.43s]  All right, should I just do the Fall Guys strategy?
[3469.43s -> 3501.96s]  All right, what's going on?
[3501.96s -> 3502.52s]  Tell me.
[3502.52s -> 3507.22s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and I'd like to know more
[3507.22s -> 3511.67s]  about the feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt mentioned before.
[3511.67s -> 3516.31s]  You feel this way because you want the kind of happy life you see all around you.
[3517.03s -> 3519.53s]  Kind you know everyone else is enjoying.
[3520.34s -> 3522.82s]  And that's exactly why we're here to help.
[3523.46s -> 3533.78s]  It's all about perspective.
[3534.34s -> 3539.91s]  This is why I don't have a coat rack in my house.
[3539.91s -> 3546.68s]  I don't have any furniture that looks like a person in the dark.
[3546.68s -> 3551.14s]  It's just bed, barrows, nothing else.
[3551.14s -> 3554.81s]  I don't want to turn over in half asleep and look at the coat rack
[3554.81s -> 3557.29s]  and think that someone's going to literally hit me with a fucking hammer in the head.
[3557.29s -> 3558.01s]  You know what I mean?
[3558.01s -> 3558.73s]  That's not going to happen.
[3558.73s -> 3577.14s]  I'm sorry.
[3577.14s -> 3578.18s]  Shut up and play the game.
[3578.18s -> 3578.74s]  I am.
[3578.74s -> 3579.70s]  What are you talking about?
[3579.70s -> 3585.29s]  Play the game.
[3585.29s -> 3586.25s]  Don't play the game.
[3586.25s -> 3586.89s]  Next game.
[3586.89s -> 3587.37s]  New game.
[3587.37s -> 3588.01s]  Old game.
[3588.01s -> 3593.14s]  Got fucking Goldilocks Andes here today.
[3601.19s -> 3601.83s]  Oh, right here.
[3615.66s -> 3619.34s]  You were advised to subject yourself to explosive mental overload
[3619.34s -> 3624.54s]  by descending into additional dreams but have now descended into a dream within a dream instead,
[3624.54s -> 3627.02s]  disorienting yourself even further.
[3627.02s -> 3630.38s]  You are responsible for failing to make this crucial distinction.
[3631.10s -> 3637.62s]  That counts, right?
[3641.43s -> 3642.07s]  That doesn't count.
[3645.50s -> 3651.00s]  Dude, if you ever find yourself a dream within a dream and you're very aware of it,
[3651.00s -> 3655.19s]  think of an insane invention.
[3655.19s -> 3656.95s]  Think of something that is just crazy.
[3656.95s -> 3661.06s]  Think of an awesome story or an amazing invention.
[3661.06s -> 3665.62s]  Your mind, your subconscious mind will create such unbelievable shit.
[3665.62s -> 3668.47s]  And then when you get up, fucking write it down because it might be revolutionary.
[3668.47s -> 3671.77s]  How many times you've been in a dream and you've actually thought of,
[3671.77s -> 3675.13s]  holy shit, this is an incredible invention that I just came up with.
[3675.13s -> 3676.81s]  Oh, this is an awesome movie.
[3676.81s -> 3677.61s]  That would be amazing.
[3677.61s -> 3680.55s]  This is a great video game.
[3680.55s -> 3682.87s]  Our subconscious minds come up with some of the craziest shit.
[3684.38s -> 3685.66s]  I never write them down.
[3685.66s -> 3686.14s]  Write them down.
[3695.27s -> 3695.91s]  Can I?
[3695.91s -> 3696.71s]  No.
[3696.71s -> 3698.55s]  I thought this worked on the exits.
[3698.55s -> 3701.78s]  Like, it's going to change the...
[3701.78s -> 3706.73s]  Oh, wait, that wasn't an exit.
[3706.73s -> 3743.19s]  Wait, what's down here?
[3743.19s -> 3745.03s]  Yeah, if you're talking to somebody in your dream, go,
[3745.03s -> 3748.78s]  hey, what's the best thing that you could come up with invention-wise?
[3748.78s -> 3749.88s]  What is it?
[3749.88s -> 3753.00s]  The person will be like, oh, well, I mean, we've got to have a new type of
[3753.88s -> 3756.04s]  plastic material that could be a rope.
[3756.60s -> 3757.48s]  Listen to that person.
[3757.48s -> 3760.79s]  They're going to tell you something insane.
[3760.79s -> 3762.55s]  You will come up with a new chemical
[3762.55s -> 3765.19s]  because the person in your brain you're talking to will tell you.
[3765.19s -> 3777.98s]  I need to get that over here.
[3777.98s -> 3788.92s]  Does that work or should I move it?
[3788.92s -> 3790.34s]  No, that doesn't work.
[3790.34s -> 3796.50s]  All right, get it away.
[3796.50s -> 3810.95s]  Can I grab it through here?
[3810.95s -> 3814.26s]  No.
[3814.26s -> 3815.62s]  Wait, is there an opening here?
[3815.62s -> 3823.34s]  Does that work?
[3823.34s -> 3823.90s]  I'm confused.
[3823.90s -> 3824.62s]  I don't know if it worked.
[3824.62s -> 3837.13s]  That did not work.
[3837.13s -> 3841.27s]  Hold on.
[3841.27s -> 3857.08s]  Can I go the other way?
[3857.08s -> 3858.12s]  Oh, shit, did I blow it?
[3863.40s -> 3864.20s]  Did I blow it?
[3864.20s -> 3874.60s]  Oh, no, I blew it.
[3874.60s -> 3879.43s]  Wait, what's happening?
[3879.43s -> 3881.14s]  Give me that.
[3881.14s -> 3888.94s]  I don't have two.
[3888.94s -> 3910.23s]  I need light.
[3910.23s -> 3911.03s]  Make this bright.
[3911.03s -> 3912.57s]  Light this whole room up.
[3912.65s -> 3994.63s]  These aren't open, though.
[3994.63s -> 3995.35s]  I don't get it.
[3995.35s -> 4012.60s]  Can I light it up or something?
[4012.60s -> 4030.76s]  I don't understand where to go.
[4030.76s -> 4031.26s]  Oh.
[4040.14s -> 4047.18s]  Did you know that unintentional multi-dream layering occurs in less than 1% of patients?
[4047.18s -> 4050.54s]  This correlates strongly with the 99% of patients
[4050.54s -> 4055.18s]  who are able to follow simple instructions from the standard orientation protocol.
[4055.18s -> 4055.68s]  Where's the knife?
[4056.70s -> 4060.07s]  And there's a knife right here.
[4065.29s -> 4078.89s]  What?
[4078.89s -> 4102.87s]  IKEA?
[4102.87s -> 4107.05s]  Oh, it was red paint.
[4107.05s -> 4109.13s]  It was red paint all along.
[4109.13s -> 4110.17s]  And that's the-
[4110.17s -> 4111.83s]  Look at that.
[4111.83s -> 4112.63s]  Interesting.
[4112.63s -> 4114.95s]  Okay, can I pick anything up?
[4114.95s -> 4116.15s]  It was just a joke.
[4116.15s -> 4123.03s]  I can grab the cans.
[4123.03s -> 4127.00s]  I'm getting out of here.
[4127.00s -> 4159.34s]  I'm going out the window.
[4159.34s -> 4176.70s]  Hey, I'm almost there.
[4176.70s -> 4178.30s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4178.30s -> 4195.93s]  Did I lose it forever?
[4195.93s -> 4225.08s]  No, no, I can get this.
[4225.08s -> 4225.72s]  Never mind.
[4225.72s -> 4234.31s]  What does it say?
[4234.31s -> 4238.47s]  Something.
[4238.47s -> 4239.75s]  At least he's handsome.
[4241.43s -> 4259.43s]  I appreciate that.
[4259.43s -> 4260.63s]  This is my good side, yeah.
[4260.63s -> 4261.99s]  I know some people say that.
[4261.99s -> 4280.63s]  Turn it off.
[4280.63s -> 4295.08s]  Thumbnail photo.
[4295.08s -> 4297.30s]  You know, I thought a long time ago
[4297.30s -> 4301.11s]  it would be kind of funny.
[4301.11s -> 4307.91s]  10 years ago, I took 20 to 30 thumbnail photos
[4307.91s -> 4309.75s]  and never stopped using them.
[4309.75s -> 4313.90s]  And I used them still everywhere for everything.
[4313.90s -> 4316.38s]  10 plus years later, I look-
[4316.38s -> 4320.17s]  Wait, it's like, man, you look really young in those thumbnails.
[4320.17s -> 4329.08s]  Take enough of them where they could have any context.
[4329.08s -> 4331.59s]  Take some really specific ones
[4331.59s -> 4336.87s]  that could only exist in Elden Ring, for instance.
[4336.87s -> 4338.55s]  Like, look, I'm wearing a-
[4338.55s -> 4340.95s]  Oh, I'm wearing a crown or something.
[4340.95s -> 4343.30s]  Or something very specific
[4343.30s -> 4346.60s]  that could be used for Elden Ring.
[4346.60s -> 4348.76s]  And I took all these 10 years ago.
[4348.76s -> 4357.75s]  Like me with a Mario mustache on and a Mario costume
[4357.75s -> 4359.27s]  and I play Mario and it's like, dude,
[4359.27s -> 4361.27s]  you were fucking 25 when you took these pictures.
[4361.27s -> 4365.66s]  Take some different ones.
[4365.66s -> 4367.02s]  Only Elden Ring has crowns.
[4367.02s -> 4367.90s]  I know, but you know what I mean, though?
[4367.90s -> 4371.43s]  Just take like 300 photos.
[4371.43s -> 4374.06s]  Incredibly specific shit.
[4374.06s -> 4377.02s]  At least 200 of them would be very specific.
[4377.02s -> 4379.98s]  Like me holding a Rubik's Cube, right?
[4379.98s -> 4380.78s]  Just in case.
[4380.78s -> 4386.47s]  Just do it now.
[4386.47s -> 4387.19s]  It's too late now.
[4387.91s -> 4388.63s]  I can't do it.
[4388.63s -> 4402.81s]  One of you other comedians can do it.
[4402.81s -> 4410.36s]  But I want credit and I want 5% of all your royalties.
[4410.36s -> 4412.28s]  When you're 60 and you're streaming,
[4412.28s -> 4417.13s]  you're going to want to do this.
[4417.13s -> 4426.74s]  I'm clearly in my 50s.
[4426.74s -> 4428.02s]  Do it for 10 years from now.
[4428.02s -> 4428.82s]  I don't think I'm going to look down
[4428.82s -> 4430.34s]  on just different 10 years from now.
[4430.34s -> 4431.67s]  Will I?
[4431.67s -> 4432.23s]  Probably.
[4432.23s -> 4433.35s]  That's a weird thought.
[4433.35s -> 4444.74s]  I don't want to know the answer to that question.
[4444.74s -> 4449.40s]  All right, something to do with unlocking it, right?
[4449.40s -> 4452.82s]  Perspective or something.
[4452.82s -> 4455.24s]  Look at it from an angle.
[4455.24s -> 4456.68s]  Hold on, can I take anything from here?
[4456.68s -> 4472.54s]  Are you going to be Benjamin Button?
[4472.54s -> 4488.38s]  What a fucking weird movie, by the way.
[4488.38s -> 4489.02s]  Great.
[4489.02s -> 4490.92s]  Now I know what we're doing for the next hour.
[4512.81s -> 4515.61s]  I know for a fact at least one person closed the stream
[4515.61s -> 4517.37s]  because they went, it's time for bed.
[4517.37s -> 4519.27s]  I don't really want to see this shit.
[4520.23s -> 4522.55s]  Somebody just went, oh, he's going to do this.
[4522.55s -> 4523.67s]  It's like, oh, it's kind of funny.
[4523.67s -> 4526.73s]  But close the iPad, you know, whatever.
[4526.73s -> 4527.53s]  Put it down.
[4527.53s -> 4528.97s]  Like that sound.
[4528.97s -> 4539.02s]  And then they put it over and go to bed.
[4539.02s -> 4540.22s]  Oh, that's it.
[4540.22s -> 4542.50s]  Oh, that's it.
[4543.06s -> 4549.64s]  All right, we're good.
[4549.64s -> 4551.00s]  I fucking ruined it.
[4551.00s -> 4552.36s]  I hate that I ruined it.
[4552.36s -> 4586.70s]  You've ruined everything.
[4586.70s -> 4587.34s]  Attention.
[4587.34s -> 4590.38s]  Dr. Pierce requires you to note the following risks
[4590.38s -> 4592.30s]  of dream over exposure.
[4592.30s -> 4595.98s]  Significant memory loss, both quantitative and qualitative.
[4595.98s -> 4599.10s]  Hallucinations of dreaded or annoying objects.
[4599.10s -> 4602.14s]  Unrealistic beliefs about the lengths of hallways
[4602.14s -> 4605.02s]  and other side effects which have not yet been discovered
[4605.02s -> 4606.62s]  or which cannot be understood.
[4606.62s -> 4607.26s]  I don't want to hear it.
[4607.26s -> 4608.14s]  I actually don't want to.
[4608.14s -> 4609.34s]  How do I turn this off?
[4609.34s -> 4610.46s]  I actually don't want to hear this.
[4611.78s -> 4613.30s]  I actually don't want to hear this sound.
[4648.90s -> 4649.14s]  OK.
[4661.10s -> 4662.14s]  Silent stream.
[4662.14s -> 4663.26s]  I don't want to put.
[4663.26s -> 4666.04s]  My cursor is different.
[4666.04s -> 4676.02s]  It was a smiley.
[4676.02s -> 4676.50s]  Now it's not.
[4676.50s -> 4677.22s]  That's weird.
[4677.22s -> 4680.20s]  Right click to return.
[4680.20s -> 4680.44s]  All right.
[4680.44s -> 4690.31s]  So I got a bunch of apples and holy shit.
[4690.31s -> 4690.79s]  That's big.
[4690.79s -> 4691.19s]  All right.
[4691.19s -> 4692.71s]  Um, take it off.
[4692.71s -> 4693.77s]  How do I get it?
[4693.77s -> 4694.81s]  Oh, I have to roll it.
[4694.81s -> 4707.51s]  Come on, get it off.
[4707.51s -> 4736.89s]  This reminds me of the Beatles movie.
[4736.89s -> 4738.89s]  Um, I can't pick these up.
[4738.89s -> 4746.87s]  I can't pick these up.
[4746.87s -> 4787.51s]  Am I doing this right?
[4787.51s -> 4788.87s]  Uh, I don't think.
[4788.87s -> 4789.51s]  I don't know.
[4789.51s -> 4793.77s]  This is where I stopped playing.
[4793.77s -> 4797.27s]  Really?
[4797.27s -> 4846.10s]  Uh, I can see why.
[4846.10s -> 4847.30s]  Shouldn't have quit, man.
[4847.30s -> 4859.86s]  Where's the exit?
[4859.86s -> 4868.78s]  It's right by me.
[4868.78s -> 4879.69s]  Dr. Pierce is frantically submitting numerous spelling
[4879.69s -> 4882.33s]  and grammar mistakes into the standard orientation.
[4882.33s -> 4882.81s]  Wow.
[4882.81s -> 4892.65s]  You're so much better than them.
[4892.65s -> 4894.89s]  You will not receive these messages.
[4894.89s -> 4896.73s]  They would not make sense regardless.
[4901.13s -> 4902.65s]  Saw that one from a mile away.
[4902.65s -> 4907.13s]  Did I have a play condemned too?
[4907.13s -> 4915.32s]  I did.
[4915.32s -> 4916.28s]  Did I beat it?
[4916.28s -> 4921.94s]  That was one.
[4921.94s -> 4922.98s]  Oh, no, I did.
[4922.98s -> 4923.54s]  Yeah.
[4923.54s -> 4934.15s]  Have I played every video game?
[4934.15s -> 4938.06s]  Significant error will interpret his basic ideas.
[4938.06s -> 4938.78s]  Hello.
[4938.78s -> 4940.62s]  My introductions are redundant.
[4940.62s -> 4943.54s]  A real doctor who went to doctor school.
[4943.54s -> 4945.78s]  VR has never been a mistake.
[4945.78s -> 4948.26s]  I can help you, but I also do not know how.
[4948.26s -> 4949.06s]  I thought I had to pick that up.
[4949.06s -> 4950.10s]  Transmission ends.
[4955.88s -> 4956.78s]  Hello.
[4956.78s -> 4959.02s]  Name is my Pierce, Dr. Glenn.
[4959.02s -> 4961.90s]  To the Somnusculpt welcome experience.
[4961.90s -> 4963.10s]  You haven't played Cave Story?
[4964.78s -> 4965.50s]  Little do you know.
[4966.46s -> 4967.98s]  I did on YouTube.
[4967.98s -> 4969.18s]  Professional invention.
[4969.98s -> 4971.66s]  Age science with cutting.
[4971.66s -> 4973.50s]  A tomorrow can brighten.
[4973.50s -> 4975.26s]  I'm actually, seriously.
[4978.06s -> 4981.66s]  How many of you guys were here for the,
[4981.74s -> 4983.58s]  those old YouTube streams?
[4983.58s -> 4991.59s]  Wait, what?
[4991.59s -> 4992.79s]  Is there even anybody here?
[4997.38s -> 4999.94s]  I wonder just how many people stuck around for that long.
[4999.94s -> 5003.29s]  What about the suffering?
[5003.29s -> 5004.41s]  I played the suffering one.
[5004.97s -> 5007.27s]  I don't think I beat it though.
[5007.27s -> 5007.51s]  All right.
[5007.51s -> 5008.87s]  That's a relaxation room.
[5008.87s -> 5009.83s]  That's bait.
[5009.83s -> 5012.14s]  We're going to go into the scream room.
[5012.14s -> 5038.65s]  That's pretty nice.
[5038.65s -> 5044.71s]  Started watching you on YouTube, but not the YouTube streams.
[5045.35s -> 5053.94s]  Hello.
[5053.94s -> 5055.86s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[5056.50s -> 5059.46s]  This is a notification that you have reappeared.
[5059.46s -> 5060.74s]  Was Cave Story on Twitch?
[5060.74s -> 5061.38s]  Was it?
[5061.38s -> 5062.34s]  I thought it was on YouTube.
[5062.82s -> 5066.23s]  Please continue to do whatever you did most recently.
[5066.23s -> 5070.78s]  And discontinue whatever you were doing immediately prior to that.
[5070.78s -> 5076.36s]  The beginning of the game?
[5076.36s -> 5110.10s]  Wait, I need to, I need to stand on something.
[5110.10s -> 5114.22s]  What can I bring with me?
[5114.22s -> 5114.78s]  Chair?
[5114.78s -> 5124.55s]  Podium?
[5124.55s -> 5125.75s]  Dollhouse 2.
[5125.75s -> 5129.30s]  Should I make it smaller?
[5129.30s -> 5134.71s]  That's way bigger.
[5134.71s -> 5140.26s]  Hold on.
[5140.26s -> 5140.82s]  Oh shit.
[5140.82s -> 5141.94s]  It is what you do.
[5141.94s -> 5142.58s]  All right.
[5142.58s -> 5148.01s]  Can I get out?
[5148.01s -> 5156.92s]  Oh, I can't get out.
[5156.92s -> 5157.24s]  Shit.
[5157.24s -> 5171.48s]  It's, I got to make it, it should be perfect.
[5171.48s -> 5195.37s]  Um, how does this work?
[5195.37s -> 5205.26s]  God damn it.
[5205.26s -> 5212.92s]  I think that's correct.
[5212.92s -> 5213.32s]  Yeah.
[5213.32s -> 5217.78s]  This game is cute.
[5217.78s -> 5241.80s]  Hello again, Peter.
[5241.80s -> 5244.30s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[5244.30s -> 5248.62s]  In addition to continuing and discontinuing as mentioned earlier,
[5248.62s -> 5253.74s]  please also disregard any unsettling experiences that you may have recently had.
[5254.54s -> 5259.02s]  Everything should have now reverted to being soothing and therapeutic.
[5259.82s -> 5263.74s]  If this is not the case, you may be receiving this message in error.
[5264.54s -> 5267.93s]  Cute means you hate it.
[5268.57s -> 5269.29s]  No.
[5269.29s -> 5270.65s]  Cute means exactly what I said.
[5270.65s -> 5271.61s]  It's cute.
[5271.61s -> 5272.25s]  It's a cute game.
[5272.25s -> 5272.49s]  It's fun.
[5272.49s -> 5274.33s]  I'm very engaged.
[5274.33s -> 5276.49s]  There hasn't been any slow parts in this.
[5276.49s -> 5278.65s]  It's been just content, content, content, content, content.
[5278.65s -> 5279.21s]  No stopping.
[5279.21s -> 5280.17s]  No slow down.
[5281.03s -> 5283.37s]  The puzzles aren't obnoxious.
[5284.17s -> 5284.65s]  They're fun.
[5284.65s -> 5285.61s]  They're interesting.
[5285.61s -> 5286.09s]  Content.
[5286.81s -> 5299.05s]  Holy shit.
[5299.05s -> 5299.29s]  Okay.
[5299.85s -> 5305.90s]  Can I jump into this?
[5306.46s -> 5316.89s]  Try harder.
[5317.99s -> 5319.11s]  I think I'm doing fine.
[5338.42s -> 5344.50s]  Oh, no, stop.
[5344.50s -> 5354.36s]  It'll be huge.
[5354.36s -> 5356.20s]  You're doing suspiciously good.
[5356.20s -> 5359.80s]  What, like, you mean I watched a let's play of this yesterday in anticipation?
[5360.57s -> 5363.26s]  Words have been tough today, I'll be honest.
[5363.26s -> 5364.06s]  I don't know why.
[5364.06s -> 5369.80s]  If a word has, I'm telling you, go back and watch this VOD.
[5369.80s -> 5373.94s]  If a word has had more than four syllables, I've got it wrong.
[5373.94s -> 5379.61s]  Anticipation, right?
[5379.61s -> 5380.97s]  You know, soliloquy.
[5380.97s -> 5382.57s]  I said that wrong earlier, didn't I?
[5382.57s -> 5400.22s]  You're reading too many mean comments.
[5400.22s -> 5400.54s]  Am I?
[5400.54s -> 5401.18s]  No, I'm not.
[5401.18s -> 5402.50s]  None of them mean.
[5402.50s -> 5403.62s]  Who said a mean comment?
[5403.62s -> 5407.06s]  I don't remember a mean comment.
[5407.06s -> 5408.42s]  I don't think anyone's been mean.
[5408.42s -> 5410.26s]  People have just been messing around.
[5410.26s -> 5410.82s]  It's fine.
[5410.82s -> 5415.59s]  No, I don't think anyone's been mean.
[5415.59s -> 5417.00s]  People are just having fun.
[5417.00s -> 5419.75s]  It's all right.
[5419.75s -> 5425.22s]  My name is Dr. Favorite Inspirational Quote.
[5425.22s -> 5430.41s]  Worst thing you can do is focus on negativity.
[5430.41s -> 5434.90s]  Won't spare you from the cage of death, the pain of disease,
[5434.90s -> 5438.82s]  the cruelty of time, the cold shell of human nature,
[5438.82s -> 5442.18s]  or the eventual loss of everything you've ever held dear.
[5442.82s -> 5445.54s]  Whatever you do, don't focus on that.
[5450.82s -> 5453.06s]  OK, I'm going to listen to the narrator.
[5453.06s -> 5461.43s]  All right.
[5461.43s -> 5462.15s]  Oh, yeah.
[5462.15s -> 5470.14s]  Is it going to be fun?
[5470.14s -> 5471.10s]  No, it's too big.
[5471.10s -> 5471.82s]  There we go.
[5471.82s -> 5479.82s]  Too much.
[5479.82s -> 5484.15s]  God damn it.
[5484.15s -> 5484.65s]  Shit.
[5507.91s -> 5508.55s]  Did I make it?
[5508.55s -> 5548.10s]  What am I looking at here?
[5548.10s -> 5548.74s]  I don't get it.
[5548.74s -> 5553.45s]  I've got to get up there.
[5553.45s -> 5557.53s]  I don't get it.
[5557.53s -> 5558.25s]  I ruined it.
[5558.25s -> 5558.81s]  How do I do that?
[5558.81s -> 5563.85s]  I don't get it.
[5563.85s -> 5564.41s]  I get it.
[5564.41s -> 5577.53s]  I get it.
[5577.53s -> 5586.68s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce, and I'd like to thank you
[5586.68s -> 5592.36s]  for triggering every single one of our 823 emergency protocols.
[5592.36s -> 5596.68s]  This will assist us greatly in improving the system for future patients.
[5597.24s -> 5598.36s]  Congratulations.
[5599.16s -> 5602.12s]  Anyway, you're now headed in the right direction,
[5602.12s -> 5605.96s]  and we should be able to initiate the emergency exit protocol shortly.
[5622.34s -> 5624.33s]  The dark portal.
[5624.33s -> 5625.21s]  Oh, shit.
[5625.21s -> 5626.57s]  I'm going into the nether.
[5626.57s -> 5630.26s]  Come on, give me all you Minecraft fans.
[5630.26s -> 5630.74s]  Come on.
[5630.74s -> 5638.54s]  Wait, am I too big?
[5638.54s -> 5640.86s]  Oh, my goodness.
[5640.86s -> 5642.94s]  I'm so OK.
[5642.94s -> 5643.58s]  I need to be.
[5644.14s -> 5650.68s]  I don't get it.
[5650.68s -> 5652.97s]  I wait.
[5652.97s -> 5657.27s]  I kind of get it a little.
[5657.27s -> 5660.14s]  I kind of understand this.
[5660.14s -> 5661.26s]  I get it a little bit.
[5661.26s -> 5664.95s]  OK, I get it.
[5664.95s -> 5668.86s]  OK, I get it.
[5668.86s -> 5670.86s]  All right, I get it.
[5670.86s -> 5672.81s]  I just have to go through that.
[5675.03s -> 5680.76s]  Wait, I think I'm too big to even go in this.
[5680.76s -> 5685.99s]  I'm too big.
[5685.99s -> 5686.39s]  I can't.
[5686.39s -> 5687.11s]  I broke it.
[5687.11s -> 5688.07s]  I can't do it.
[5688.07s -> 5691.24s]  I think I'm actually too big.
[5691.32s -> 5706.76s]  I don't think I can make this big enough.
[5706.76s -> 5707.32s]  Maybe.
[5707.32s -> 5708.04s]  Hold on.
[5708.04s -> 5708.60s]  Yeah, I can.
[5708.60s -> 5708.84s]  All right.
[5708.84s -> 5727.22s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5727.22s -> 5728.74s]  Don't fall.
[5728.74s -> 5730.10s]  Stop falling.
[5730.10s -> 5733.19s]  Stop falling.
[5733.19s -> 5734.15s]  Stop falling.
[5734.15s -> 5747.70s]  That works.
[5747.70s -> 5748.18s]  Get in there.
[5748.18s -> 5748.98s]  Can I crouch?
[5748.98s -> 5758.04s]  Stupid.
[5758.04s -> 5758.84s]  Come on.
[5758.84s -> 5759.72s]  Get out of the way.
[5759.72s -> 5805.03s]  I made it.
[5805.03s -> 5806.87s]  I am very small.
[5806.87s -> 5809.03s]  I am incredibly small.
[5809.83s -> 5810.55s]  I need to fix this.
[5810.55s -> 5811.11s]  Hold on.
[5811.11s -> 5833.58s]  I can't get even smaller.
[5833.58s -> 5834.14s]  Can I?
[5834.14s -> 5837.74s]  No, I've got to be at least normal size here.
[5837.74s -> 5844.92s]  Is that better?
[5844.92s -> 5847.34s]  No, I got to be huge for this.
[5847.34s -> 5859.16s]  Hold on.
[5859.16s -> 5861.40s]  Can I not do that?
[5861.40s -> 5862.04s]  Okay.
[5862.04s -> 5889.08s]  I think I don't.
[5889.08s -> 5914.42s]  Oh, how am I doing on time for the game?
[5915.24s -> 5916.20s]  Am I almost at the end?
[5916.20s -> 5917.00s]  Am I halfway?
[5917.64s -> 5918.36s]  30%?
[5918.36s -> 5919.85s]  Two thirds?
[5919.85s -> 5920.33s]  What do you think?
[5920.33s -> 5921.13s]  Oh, how tall?
[5921.13s -> 5922.09s]  Not how tall am I.
[5922.09s -> 5922.97s]  How far am I?
[5922.97s -> 5933.74s]  You're pretty close.
[5933.74s -> 5934.30s]  Okay, cool.
[5934.30s -> 5935.80s]  Just curious.
[5966.66s -> 5967.30s]  Analysis.
[5971.11s -> 5971.75s]  Uh-oh.
[5971.75s -> 5973.19s]  Blood except it's paint.
[5988.50s -> 5989.06s]  This is lore.
[5995.03s -> 5995.75s]  Some lore here.
[5996.71s -> 5999.03s]  1991, 1992.
[5999.03s -> 6000.31s]  This takes place in the 90s.
[6000.95s -> 6004.34s]  Okay, cool.
[6018.50s -> 6019.46s]  Reformulating.
[6025.50s -> 6027.10s]  Improved hypothesis.
[6027.10s -> 6030.38s]  Patient requires additional Somnascope therapy.
[6030.38s -> 6031.34s]  Conclusion.
[6031.34s -> 6033.34s]  Emergency exit protocol cannot proceed.
[6033.34s -> 6034.38s]  Wake up.
[6034.38s -> 6037.66s]  Emergency exit protocol has been emergency destroyed.
[6041.29s -> 6042.09s]  Instruction.
[6042.09s -> 6046.17s]  Continue with Somnascope therapy indefinitely on an independent basis
[6046.17s -> 6048.97s]  as all orientation resources have been exhausted.
[6049.61s -> 6052.89s]  This concludes your standard orientation protocol.
[6052.89s -> 6053.39s]  Goodbye.
[6054.09s -> 6064.02s]  I don't have a TV in this hotel.
[6064.50s -> 6077.74s]  Okay.
[6077.74s -> 6079.48s]  Wake up.
[6079.48s -> 6080.76s]  Where's the continental breakfast?
[6080.76s -> 6082.76s]  Yeah, where's the orange juice machine?
[6082.76s -> 6088.50s]  There's a trick.
[6088.50s -> 6094.66s]  Do you want to check out this little indie game?
[6094.66s -> 6096.58s]  It's called Disney Infinity 3.0.
[6096.58s -> 6111.45s]  I would sooner show my asshole on stream than play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[6111.45s -> 6116.68s]  If I think of like where that sits, you know what I mean?
[6119.21s -> 6123.67s]  Like if I'm just being, I'm just telling you that's where that sits.
[6123.67s -> 6124.31s]  What the fuck?
[6124.31s -> 6125.83s]  Why am I on the ground?
[6125.83s -> 6128.49s]  What is happening?
[6128.49s -> 6142.39s]  Um, is this supposed to be happening?
[6142.39s -> 6154.90s]  This doesn't feel right.
[6154.90s -> 6155.62s]  Wait.
[6155.62s -> 6156.58s]  Whoa.
[6156.58s -> 6157.38s]  Okay.
[6157.38s -> 6157.86s]  All right.
[6157.86s -> 6158.58s]  All right.
[6158.58s -> 6161.98s]  That just freaked me out so bad.
[6161.98s -> 6163.58s]  I was on the ground.
[6163.58s -> 6166.25s]  I, what?
[6166.25s -> 6166.65s]  Okay.
[6166.65s -> 6169.13s]  That was, that was weird.
[6169.13s -> 6177.99s]  I thought it was sucking me around and pulling me backwards.
[6177.99s -> 6180.15s]  But no, there's, I, there's nothing, I have nothing wrong.
[6180.71s -> 6184.10s]  Nothing bad to say about Disney Infinity 3.0.
[6184.10s -> 6187.38s]  There's just not a single chance I would ever play that.
[6187.38s -> 6188.70s]  Ever.
[6188.70s -> 6190.23s]  Under any circumstance.
[6190.23s -> 6192.20s]  Any circumstance.
[6192.20s -> 6193.72s]  It's just something I would never do.
[6193.72s -> 6194.52s]  Ever.
[6194.52s -> 6198.82s]  I also would never show my asshole on stream.
[6199.70s -> 6201.46s]  I'm making this up like if I had a choice.
[6201.46s -> 6217.18s]  You have to choose.
[6217.18s -> 6217.74s]  Okay.
[6217.74s -> 6223.82s]  Is the, is the show asshole stream 10 seconds long?
[6223.82s -> 6229.82s]  Is it 10 seconds of show asshole versus how many hours of Disney Infinity 3.0?
[6229.82s -> 6230.06s]  Okay.
[6230.06s -> 6232.12s]  So it's 10 seconds.
[6232.12s -> 6233.88s]  How long is the Disney Infinity stream?
[6235.06s -> 6235.62s]  10 hours?
[6235.62s -> 6241.59s]  I would, I'd show my asshole.
[6241.59s -> 6249.88s]  I would, I would, I just know I don't want to play Disney Infinity for 10 hours.
[6249.88s -> 6252.14s]  You just get banned.
[6252.14s -> 6253.26s]  It was pretty good run.
[6253.26s -> 6254.38s]  I think it was pretty good run.
[6254.38s -> 6260.97s]  I'm not playing Disney Infinity for 10 hours.
[6260.97s -> 6270.26s]  Because that means two, uh, okay, maybe I would still do it.
[6270.26s -> 6276.90s]  If you said 15 hours, that crosses the threshold of that's three streams.
[6276.90s -> 6279.30s]  I'm not playing Disney Infinity 3.0 for three streams.
[6279.30s -> 6280.42s]  What if it's awesome though?
[6280.42s -> 6281.78s]  What if it's a great game?
[6281.78s -> 6290.07s]  What if I loved it?
[6290.07s -> 6290.63s]  Okay.
[6290.63s -> 6298.10s]  Maybe I make that bigger and jump into it in Mario style.
[6298.10s -> 6298.90s]  Yeah, definitely.
[6298.90s -> 6320.44s]  I found the first one okay.
[6320.44s -> 6321.16s]  All right, hold on.
[6321.16s -> 6326.60s]  Is it one of those games where you select three or four licensed characters
[6326.60s -> 6338.30s]  and they auto battle turn-based RPG style with people in the villains from the universe?
[6338.30s -> 6341.16s]  No, wait.
[6341.16s -> 6341.72s]  So hold on.
[6341.72s -> 6350.86s]  It's not I choose Buzz Lightyear, uh, Woody and, uh, the dog from Lady and the Tramp.
[6350.86s -> 6351.58s]  It's not that.
[6351.58s -> 6356.46s]  It's not like a battle RPG kind of.
[6356.46s -> 6358.54s]  Wait, so it's Skylanders.
[6358.54s -> 6361.69s]  Oh, oh, I had the game wrong.
[6361.69s -> 6362.98s]  I'd play it.
[6362.98s -> 6382.06s]  Yeah, it's like a Disney Skylanders.
[6382.06s -> 6383.34s]  One of those toys to life games.
[6383.34s -> 6385.26s]  The figures have a chip in them like an amiibo.
[6389.05s -> 6403.40s]  Dude, come on.
[6403.40s -> 6407.67s]  What?
[6407.67s -> 6410.70s]  Oh, oh, you're going to make me puke with this one.
[6410.70s -> 6431.67s]  Are you actually going to make me actually throw up this one?
[6431.67s -> 6453.93s]  Uh, uh, this is infinity.
[6453.93s -> 6460.60s]  Okay, but can I put a can I put a stipulation on the on the asshole stream?
[6460.60s -> 6466.97s]  Could that be, uh, all right, Disney infinity for 15 hours or I show my asshole,
[6466.97s -> 6470.17s]  but I need I need a half a million dollars in donations.
[6485.48s -> 6487.88s]  Can you imagine the fucking articles?
[6487.88s -> 6499.82s]  I'm just imagining a scenario where it's like, oh, yeah, we're almost there.
[6500.46s -> 6502.46s]  Four hundred and eighty thousand dollars.
[6502.46s -> 6503.90s]  Wow, I can't believe it.
[6503.90s -> 6504.30s]  Almost.
[6504.30s -> 6505.58s]  Oh, we took we did it.
[6505.58s -> 6507.42s]  Five hundred five hundred.
[6507.42s -> 6508.06s]  I can't help.
[6508.94s -> 6514.41s]  Five hundred thousand and I turn and would the stream go off, right?
[6514.41s -> 6516.87s]  Somebody would be there waiting.
[6516.87s -> 6521.74s]  If I had a half a million dollar donation goal, the stream would turn off immediately
[6521.74s -> 6523.58s]  when I turned around.
[6523.58s -> 6532.55s]  It would just do the disconnect thing and then it would be like this channel no longer exists.
[6532.55s -> 6534.86s]  There is no other incentive.
[6534.86s -> 6538.30s]  There's not like, oh, at ten thousand, I'm going to do this at fifty thousand.
[6538.30s -> 6543.99s]  No, it's just this one goal.
[6543.99s -> 6547.21s]  That's it.
[6547.21s -> 6550.65s]  Oh, my God, dude, what is going on?
[6550.65s -> 6556.52s]  That's the retirement stream.
[6556.52s -> 6563.70s]  No, I mean, that's that's an absurd thought thing we're doing where we're just thinking
[6563.70s -> 6567.72s]  about holy shit.
[6567.72s -> 6575.05s]  It's like Metal Gear Solid Boss music.
[6575.05s -> 6575.77s]  I got to get out of here.
[6625.50s -> 6627.26s]  Reception is not reality.
[6627.26s -> 6670.20s]  Oh, fuck off.
[6670.20s -> 6670.76s]  That's it.
[6670.76s -> 6671.48s]  No, it's not.
[6671.48s -> 6673.27s]  Go back through backwards.
[6673.27s -> 6677.06s]  There it is.
[6677.06s -> 6678.74s]  OK, backwards again.
[6678.74s -> 6695.30s]  Can I turn this green or something?
[6695.30s -> 6695.62s]  Stop.
[6695.62s -> 6734.46s]  Dead end.
[6734.46s -> 6735.10s]  Shit.
[6735.10s -> 6743.54s]  Wait, you don't get it wrong and then walk this way?
[6743.54s -> 6758.52s]  Why is it?
[6758.52s -> 6770.15s]  What did I do?
[6770.15s -> 6771.83s]  What did I do to get that to change?
[6771.83s -> 6772.07s]  What?
[6772.07s -> 6772.79s]  Wait, what did I do?
[6772.79s -> 6773.43s]  What did I do?
[6773.43s -> 6774.73s]  I did something weird.
[6774.73s -> 6775.21s]  I went through.
[6775.21s -> 6780.74s]  Wait, what?
[6780.74s -> 6781.80s]  I did it.
[6781.80s -> 6782.12s]  All right.
[6782.12s -> 6782.52s]  I got it.
[6782.52s -> 6782.84s]  I got it.
[6782.84s -> 6785.90s]  I got it.
[6785.90s -> 6787.18s]  Oh, that's not good.
[6787.18s -> 6796.36s]  What changed?
[6796.36s -> 6797.24s]  What what's changing?
[6797.24s -> 6801.05s]  What am I doing differently?
[6801.05s -> 6803.96s]  What am I doing differently when I walk through the door?
[6803.96s -> 6806.66s]  What am I doing differently?
[6806.66s -> 6807.78s]  Something is changing.
[6807.78s -> 6810.02s]  I'm going through a weird where I'm doing it weird.
[6810.02s -> 6810.66s]  What am I doing?
[6813.26s -> 6814.46s]  What changed?
[6814.46s -> 6818.23s]  Hold on.
[6818.23s -> 6829.38s]  Wait, what?
[6829.38s -> 6830.18s]  Why is it?
[6830.18s -> 6837.08s]  Did I have it right with the go through backwards thing?
[6837.08s -> 6871.53s]  I don't get it.
[6915.46s -> 6915.62s]  All right.
[6915.62s -> 6916.18s]  I have an idea.
[6931.88s -> 6932.52s]  What?
[6932.52s -> 6939.35s]  That's not right.
[6939.35s -> 6941.29s]  OK, hold on.
[6941.29s -> 6950.89s]  One, two, then this one is legit.
[6950.89s -> 6952.09s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[6952.09s -> 6966.84s]  What's going on?
[6966.84s -> 6969.82s]  If I look to the left, it's going to be the dead end.
[6969.82s -> 6971.61s]  So I got to look to the right.
[6971.61s -> 6974.68s]  I got it.
[6974.68s -> 6982.65s]  OK, if I look to the right, it's going to be the dead end.
[6982.65s -> 6988.82s]  If I look to the left, it's going to be the dead end.
[6988.82s -> 6989.54s]  OK, I got it.
[6989.54s -> 6989.86s]  I got it.
[6989.86s -> 6990.10s]  I got it.
[6990.10s -> 6990.34s]  I got it.
[6990.34s -> 7001.16s]  That was confusing.
[7001.16s -> 7002.04s]  Jump map.
[7002.04s -> 7013.27s]  Where did that go?
[7013.27s -> 7013.83s]  What?
[7013.83s -> 7015.27s]  Oh, that's weird.
[7015.27s -> 7016.62s]  That's confusing.
[7031.67s -> 7035.40s]  Good vibes and chat.
[7035.40s -> 7036.04s]  Good.
[7036.04s -> 7043.40s]  That makes me happy.
[7043.40s -> 7047.94s]  Every patient, you must understand it's possible to completely
[7047.94s -> 7052.39s]  exhaust your supply of dreams, thereby entering a state in which
[7052.39s -> 7056.47s]  you will not be able to wake up even with the help of triggering mechanisms.
[7057.19s -> 7062.01s]  This game is pretty fun.
[7063.40s -> 7064.70s]  I didn't say cute.
[7064.70s -> 7065.58s]  I said fun.
[7065.58s -> 7080.38s]  I got to get out of this room before everyone sees how ugly I am.
[7083.22s -> 7084.42s]  Bright light in my face.
[7084.42s -> 7085.30s]  All right, we're good.
[7085.30s -> 7102.31s]  What the hell?
[7102.31s -> 7157.98s]  OK, I don't get it.
[7157.98s -> 7159.93s]  This one has lights over it.
[7159.93s -> 7164.38s]  It's that one.
[7164.38s -> 7164.78s]  This one.
[7164.78s -> 7166.46s]  OK, this one has lights over it.
[7166.46s -> 7167.70s]  So it's this one.
[7167.70s -> 7170.12s]  This one has lights over it.
[7170.12s -> 7170.60s]  This one.
[7170.60s -> 7172.28s]  Oh, they all have lights over it.
[7172.28s -> 7236.60s]  Interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting, interesting.
[7236.60s -> 7237.96s]  I'm looking for the arrows on the ground.
[7237.96s -> 7238.68s]  Here we go.
[7238.68s -> 7247.78s]  There's an arrow on this ground.
[7247.78s -> 7272.63s]  I don't get it.
[7272.63s -> 7275.05s]  Follow the arrow?
[7275.05s -> 7283.58s]  That's what I did.
[7283.58s -> 7284.54s]  There's no more arrows.
[7284.54s -> 7295.03s]  Where's the other arrows?
[7295.03s -> 7296.74s]  Where are the other arrows?
[7296.74s -> 7298.02s]  Just keep going?
[7298.02s -> 7338.10s]  I don't think I'm doing this right.
[7338.10s -> 7338.34s]  Why?
[7338.34s -> 7339.14s]  That was correct.
[7339.14s -> 7339.70s]  Holy shit.
[7339.70s -> 7340.34s]  Get me out of there.
[7352.14s -> 7360.50s]  This is trippy.
[7360.50s -> 7378.20s]  Wait, there's a wall.
[7378.20s -> 7380.52s]  Oh, that's weird.
[7380.52s -> 7385.46s]  I don't like that.
[7385.46s -> 7387.14s]  Oh, I don't like that either.
[7387.14s -> 7392.49s]  I don't like that either.
[7392.49s -> 7401.06s]  Oh, is this going to turn into a...
[7403.30s -> 7404.34s]  Yeah, OK.
[7404.34s -> 7406.10s]  So what is the right way?
[7406.10s -> 7427.59s]  OK, it's this way.
[7427.59s -> 7428.79s]  Wait, what the hell is...
[7428.79s -> 7432.14s]  It's closing in.
[7467.42s -> 7472.63s]  Is this like a coffee shop?
[7476.52s -> 7484.31s]  What's over here?
[7484.31s -> 7507.88s]  Oh, am I picking up my own box?
[7507.88s -> 7511.27s]  What the hell is going on here?
[7511.27s -> 7534.58s]  I want it to be bigger.
[7534.58s -> 7594.55s]  What's going on here?
[7603.93s -> 7604.97s]  Hold on.
[7604.97s -> 7605.53s]  I got to...
[7605.53s -> 7612.52s]  What should I do with this?
[7626.20s -> 7629.74s]  Ow.
[7629.74s -> 7664.34s]  Oh, shit.
[7664.34s -> 7665.30s]  I can get in there.
[7665.30s -> 7675.88s]  What did I do?
[7675.88s -> 7677.51s]  What did I do?
[7677.51s -> 7678.39s]  What did I do?
[7678.39s -> 7679.21s]  What did I do wrong?
[7679.53s -> 7681.11s]  What did I do wrong?
[7681.11s -> 7685.43s]  I did something wrong.
[7685.43s -> 7686.23s]  What did I do?
[7686.23s -> 7687.19s]  I broke something.
[7687.19s -> 7691.90s]  How do I get out of here?
[7691.90s -> 7715.78s]  All right, I got to be small.
[7715.78s -> 7716.66s]  Small enough to open.
[7716.66s -> 7717.70s]  All right, I'm going this way.
[7717.70s -> 7741.93s]  This thing is going to say fucking forever.
[7741.93s -> 7742.97s]  Earwig POV.
[7744.30s -> 7745.18s]  Why did you do that?
[7745.18s -> 7747.40s]  Because I wasn't big enough to go in the back door.
[7786.46s -> 7787.66s]  What I meant to say,
[7787.66s -> 7791.16s]  I wasn't small enough to go in the back door
[7791.16s -> 7794.92s]  because I need to be tall enough to...
[7794.92s -> 7796.36s]  I have to be a certain height.
[7797.19s -> 7798.63s]  Why are your hands so white?
[7798.63s -> 7802.31s]  Because there's a big light right here.
[7802.31s -> 7804.25s]  Oh, my God.
[7804.25s -> 7805.53s]  No, get this out of the way.
[7810.95s -> 7811.75s]  I need that.
[7812.31s -> 7820.15s]  I need that thing.
[7820.15s -> 7821.19s]  Oh, it's gone.
[7821.19s -> 7822.39s]  I hope I don't need it.
[7822.39s -> 7825.72s]  Why am I going so slow?
[7825.72s -> 7834.58s]  Why am I walking so slow?
[7857.02s -> 7858.86s]  I'm an atom?
[7858.86s -> 7859.98s]  Microscopic Andy.
[7859.98s -> 7860.94s]  Just go to the checkpoint.
[7868.73s -> 7876.23s]  Why am I doing this?
[7876.23s -> 7876.71s]  Wait, what?
[7900.23s -> 7907.67s]  Where am I?
[7907.67s -> 7917.42s]  Now, I need to be both in the town
[7917.42s -> 7919.34s]  and not in the town at the same time.
[7919.34s -> 7934.01s]  Okay, where's this door that I was looking at earlier?
[7934.01s -> 7944.52s]  Right back here, right?
[7944.52s -> 7945.16s]  Right here.
[7945.16s -> 7947.03s]  I can't get in this?
[7947.03s -> 7956.95s]  Okay, never mind.
[7956.95s -> 7965.08s]  So I was doing it right before.
[7965.08s -> 7966.76s]  I have to bring this in here
[7966.76s -> 7968.76s]  and just fuck the whole thing up, right?
[8036.25s -> 8038.49s]  Ah, you made it to the giant antenna.
[8038.49s -> 8040.66s]  I'm the electrician.
[8040.66s -> 8044.23s]  I created this world.
[8044.23s -> 8046.95s]  400 years ago, humanity fell into darkness.
[8046.95s -> 8088.41s]  Is that where we're going to get one of those?
[8088.41s -> 8090.41s]  My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.
[8091.05s -> 8095.38s]  And many years ago, I had a dream.
[8095.38s -> 8098.42s]  I found myself in a place where I understood
[8098.42s -> 8100.66s]  that each of us begins as nothing,
[8101.62s -> 8103.86s]  where everything I perceived was shaped
[8103.86s -> 8106.26s]  by seeing it exactly the way I wanted to.
[8106.26s -> 8107.46s]  I'm telling you, listen to the person in your dream
[8107.46s -> 8108.90s]  when you ask them for the best invention.
[8108.90s -> 8114.26s]  If you have the opportunity and you're in a dream
[8114.26s -> 8115.62s]  and you can talk to somebody, say,
[8115.62s -> 8117.38s]  what's the greatest invention that's not,
[8117.38s -> 8119.96s]  that doesn't exist that you know?
[8119.96s -> 8120.84s]  They will give you,
[8120.84s -> 8121.96s]  make sure you write it down when you wake up.
[8172.68s -> 8175.96s]  You know what, how do you even make this in a game engine?
[8175.96s -> 8182.55s]  That's what I want to know.
[8182.55s -> 8185.91s]  How do you do this in Unreal or something?
[8185.91s -> 8194.42s]  It's just cameras, lots of math and lots of cameras.
[8194.42s -> 8205.35s]  You mask out all the cameras.
[8205.35s -> 8207.53s]  That's cool.
[8207.53s -> 8231.22s]  Can I pick anything up?
[8231.22s -> 8263.10s]  Door.
[8263.10s -> 8264.46s]  So who's the architect?
[8264.46s -> 8268.06s]  Who's the dream architect?
[8268.06s -> 8272.14s]  Is it me or is it him?
[8272.14s -> 8283.54s]  Oh shit.
[8283.54s -> 8298.01s]  But in white space,
[8298.01s -> 8300.97s]  I also faced the greatest challenge I could imagine
[8301.93s -> 8305.69s]  because with a lifetime of life itself behind me
[8305.69s -> 8307.61s]  and all of the weight that it carried,
[8308.33s -> 8311.69s]  I realized that seeing things the way I wanted to
[8311.69s -> 8313.77s]  was not as easy as it used to be.
[8314.33s -> 8321.35s]  I don't want the afterlife to be like this.
[8321.35s -> 8324.04s]  Every time people think of the afterlife,
[8324.04s -> 8326.52s]  oh, heaven, oh my God, I'm moving on.
[8326.52s -> 8328.84s]  They're floating as a specter.
[8330.42s -> 8331.30s]  Oh, wow.
[8331.30s -> 8331.78s]  Look at it.
[8331.78s -> 8333.22s]  So Elizabeth's mist everywhere.
[8333.22s -> 8335.22s]  Everything's misty and you're floating.
[8335.22s -> 8336.58s]  No, I don't want it to be like this.
[8336.58s -> 8348.74s]  Eternity is a long time.
[8348.74s -> 8355.27s]  I'd get sick of that.
[8355.27s -> 8355.99s]  Don't worry.
[8355.99s -> 8357.35s]  You're not going to heaven.
[8357.35s -> 8367.38s]  So I don't have to worry about it.
[8367.38s -> 8368.34s]  So I'll be all right.
[8368.34s -> 8378.12s]  How do I get up here?
[8378.12s -> 8406.78s]  How do I get up here?
[8406.78s -> 8415.19s]  It's all dogs go to heaven, not Jeremy's.
[8415.19s -> 8426.87s]  It's all about perspective.
[8426.87s -> 8437.08s]  Okay, like close your eyes.
[8438.25s -> 8439.05s]  Oh, heaven.
[8439.05s -> 8440.17s]  This is heaven.
[8440.17s -> 8445.82s]  I would freak out after 20 minutes.
[8445.82s -> 8451.83s]  If I was just floating around just hearing this song
[8451.83s -> 8455.02s]  and if I opened my eyes
[8455.02s -> 8457.02s]  and it was like, oh, there's like grandpa
[8457.02s -> 8459.58s]  and like my great, great, great grandfather,
[8459.58s -> 8460.54s]  my great, great, wow.
[8461.42s -> 8462.54s]  We all floated around.
[8462.54s -> 8463.66s]  I'd be like, well, this sucks.
[8464.30s -> 8464.94s]  What can we do?
[8464.94s -> 8466.54s]  Can we do anything else with this?
[8466.54s -> 8477.38s]  I don't like afterlife thoughts.
[8477.38s -> 8478.98s]  That's weird to me because I don't know.
[8478.98s -> 8481.64s]  We all know what this is like.
[8481.64s -> 8484.92s]  So changing our plane of existence in reality
[8484.92s -> 8487.18s]  drastically is too much.
[8487.18s -> 8488.62s]  We know too much.
[8488.62s -> 8493.00s]  We've experienced too many things.
[8493.00s -> 8493.88s]  Just play the game.
[8493.88s -> 8496.44s]  I'm stalling because I can't go up the stairs, man.
[8496.44s -> 8516.42s]  Just walk.
[8516.42s -> 8523.32s]  Oh, I did that like five times.
[8538.92s -> 8542.20s]  I can't wait to hang out with my great, great, great grandfather.
[8542.20s -> 8544.76s]  The guy that ran the cigarette factory.
[8544.76s -> 8546.82s]  I don't want to hang out with that guy.
[8563.85s -> 8566.57s]  I don't want to meet the caveman ancestor.
[8566.57s -> 8569.06s]  They're all going to be there.
[8569.06s -> 8574.73s]  I think we all think of like, oh, grandpa and pa
[8574.73s -> 8580.38s]  and like Uga and Uga is going to be there.
[8580.38s -> 8584.52s]  It's going to be everyone.
[8584.52s -> 8585.80s]  It's going to be too many people.
[8585.80s -> 8589.42s]  There's going to be like a trillion people up there.
[8589.42s -> 8591.91s]  That's that we've fucked up.
[8591.91s -> 8595.43s]  Everybody's caveman ancestors walking around.
[8595.43s -> 8601.59s]  Every human that you've ever come from, ever.
[8601.59s -> 8603.59s]  You, your group is going to be the most,
[8603.59s -> 8606.60s]  it's going to be the most annoying family reunion ever.
[8606.60s -> 8609.00s]  Going around and shaking every one of their hands
[8609.00s -> 8611.51s]  of like the 500 fucking people.
[8611.51s -> 8613.43s]  You know, when you go to an event and you're like,
[8613.43s -> 8615.19s]  well, I can't wait to have the same conversation
[8615.19s -> 8617.11s]  with this person and this person and this person
[8617.11s -> 8618.71s]  and say goodbye a thousand times.
[8618.71s -> 8620.66s]  That's what's going to happen.
[8620.66s -> 8632.84s]  Except it's, where are you going to go?
[8632.84s -> 8634.68s]  Yeah, and what if Uga is a piece of shit?
[8634.68s -> 8635.64s]  What if he's a dick?
[8635.64s -> 8636.60s]  I don't want to hang out with him.
[8636.60s -> 8638.12s]  I don't want to spend time with Uga.
[8638.12s -> 8652.28s]  No, I don't want to go to hell either because guess what?
[8652.28s -> 8653.56s]  You know, there's going to be somebody there
[8653.56s -> 8656.12s]  that's going to be like, yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[8657.42s -> 8657.98s]  Everything, man.
[8657.98s -> 8659.26s]  I'm glad to be down here.
[8659.26s -> 8661.58s]  It's like, I don't want to be with the one
[8661.58s -> 8664.78s]  like distant great, great, great uncle that went to hell
[8664.78s -> 8666.38s]  and hang out with him every day.
[8666.38s -> 8669.26s]  Oh, that's going to be fun.
[8669.26s -> 8676.50s]  Oh, me, drunk, great, great, great, great uncle Frank
[8676.50s -> 8679.62s]  and some random caveman that bashed in 50 people's skulls
[8679.62s -> 8681.56s]  are the only ones that are going to be down here.
[8681.56s -> 8682.68s]  That would be a disaster.
[8682.68s -> 8685.53s]  It'd be horrible.
[8685.77s -> 8689.29s]  No, dark Uga.
[8704.36s -> 8705.08s]  Dark Uga.
[8714.81s -> 8715.77s]  They both kind of suck.
[8727.96s -> 8731.08s]  I don't want to be on my best behavior in heaven every day.
[8731.08s -> 8735.05s]  You know, if like grandma's around, like I have to,
[8735.05s -> 8737.21s]  I have to, I got to hang out with grandma all the time
[8737.21s -> 8739.13s]  and I got to, I'm not going to be like, oh, fuck you,
[8739.13s -> 8740.33s]  fuck this and fuck you.
[8740.33s -> 8742.81s]  No, I'm going to be, I'm going to have to mute it down a little.
[8742.81s -> 8745.94s]  You don't talk to your grandparents like that.
[8745.94s -> 8747.06s]  I don't want to do that.
[8747.06s -> 8753.11s]  But great, great, great, drunk uncle Frank and dark Uga
[8753.11s -> 8754.57s]  are going to be doing coke every day.
[8754.57s -> 8755.69s]  I don't want to do coke every day.
[8755.69s -> 8756.65s]  I don't want to do coke.
[8756.65s -> 8768.79s]  Did I pick the wrong one?
[8768.79s -> 8769.67s]  What did I just do?
[8769.67s -> 8780.41s]  Oh, just water down the sugar.
[8780.41s -> 8781.69s]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8781.69s -> 8785.86s]  All right, so what am I doing here?
[8785.86s -> 8786.50s]  No.
[8786.50s -> 8794.10s]  Okay, I'm going down this one.
[8794.10s -> 8797.78s]  Yeah, and also I know people have made this reference before too,
[8797.78s -> 8800.74s]  but I don't want to answer to my great, great, great grandfather,
[8800.74s -> 8805.54s]  some great man that created the first steel mill in America
[8805.54s -> 8806.50s]  or whatever it is.
[8808.94s -> 8810.62s]  I have to answer to this person.
[8810.62s -> 8813.13s]  He probably thinks I'm an idiot.
[8813.13s -> 8814.25s]  He probably thinks I'm an asshole.
[8814.25s -> 8815.91s]  He probably thinks I'm stupid.
[8815.91s -> 8819.83s]  I'm the caveman to my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather.
[8819.83s -> 8825.96s]  He will think I am insane.
[8825.96s -> 8848.01s]  Can I like fall through here?
[8848.01s -> 8848.97s]  Oh shit.
[8848.97s -> 8854.46s]  Okay, this one's safe.
[8854.46s -> 8860.55s]  Is this one safe too?
[8860.55s -> 8862.26s]  I think.
[8862.26s -> 8876.34s]  You can tell him he made half a million dollars selling ass baseballs
[8876.34s -> 8877.14s]  and he'd be impressed.
[8877.14s -> 8877.94s]  No, he wouldn't.
[8877.94s -> 8881.90s]  He'd be like, what have you done?
[8881.90s -> 8884.28s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, sit here.
[8884.28s -> 8885.00s]  What have you done?
[8885.00s -> 8888.39s]  It's like, I don't want to talk about putting baseballs up my ass.
[8888.39s -> 8898.92s]  No, no, no.
[8898.92s -> 8900.60s]  Oh, what an idiot.
[8903.99s -> 8906.87s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that can't be.
[8906.87s -> 8911.46s]  Dude, I was right there.
[8911.46s -> 8912.18s]  I'm sorry.
[8912.18s -> 8912.50s]  I know.
[8912.50s -> 8914.02s]  I'm just talking.
[8914.02s -> 8924.46s]  It's more important to focus on what you enjoy in life.
[8925.02s -> 8925.50s]  Yeah.
[8925.50s -> 8928.68s]  Okay.
[8928.68s -> 8937.10s]  You know, the cafeteria sounds, you know, just loud, indistinct chatter.
[8937.10s -> 8941.56s]  That's what it's going to be like.
[8941.56s -> 8944.78s]  Except times a hundred trillion.
[8944.78s -> 8948.10s]  Where are we all going to be?
[8948.10s -> 8949.70s]  Is there a hotel room?
[8949.70s -> 8951.54s]  Is there accommodations?
[8951.54s -> 8953.62s]  Or are we all just floating around a trillion people?
[8953.62s -> 8957.24s]  Like, is there a heaven hotel?
[8957.24s -> 8957.48s]  Right?
[8957.48s -> 8958.36s]  Like, think about it.
[8958.84s -> 8960.76s]  How does, how would logistically that work?
[8960.76s -> 8966.46s]  Heaven is infinite.
[8966.46s -> 8969.53s]  But what do you mean?
[8981.48s -> 8983.96s]  I didn't sign up for an existential crisis tonight.
[8983.96s -> 8986.58s]  Well, look at the game we're playing.
[8986.58s -> 8988.82s]  It's a pretty good topic for what we're doing.
[8988.82s -> 9013.72s]  Cheese wheel and the, oh, right.
[9013.72s -> 9014.04s]  Okay.
[9014.04s -> 9015.70s]  Thank you.
[9015.70s -> 9016.34s]  Thank you.
[9016.34s -> 9025.51s]  There's no concept of time in heaven.
[9025.51s -> 9032.94s]  I know, but I don't, I like worldly stuff.
[9032.94s -> 9033.58s]  You know what I mean?
[9034.14s -> 9037.10s]  I don't want to be like a floating specter.
[9037.74s -> 9040.94s]  I want to, I want to be able to watch Frickin' Morty, okay?
[9040.94s -> 9067.21s]  And I was like, oh, but will you be one with the cosmos?
[9067.21s -> 9067.91s]  Okay, cool.
[9067.91s -> 9070.47s]  But do I get to pull some levers and do some cool shit with planets?
[9070.47s -> 9071.51s]  Can I make a planet or something?
[9071.51s -> 9072.87s]  Like, do I get to do anything like that?
[9072.87s -> 9076.54s]  It's going to be really hard to replace Frickin' Morty.
[9076.54s -> 9077.66s]  I mean, it's got to be good.
[9077.66s -> 9081.94s]  I mean, like crafting planets and being a part of like the cosmos.
[9081.94s -> 9084.18s]  I mean, is that as good as, it's got to,
[9084.18s -> 9092.81s]  will it even compare to Rick and Morty?
[9092.81s -> 9095.05s]  You will be Rick and Morty.
[9095.05s -> 9097.08s]  Okay.
[9097.08s -> 9097.72s]  I can't look at this.
[9097.72s -> 9098.76s]  I'm going to look over here.
[9098.76s -> 9105.45s]  What did you say?
[9105.45s -> 9107.70s]  This is Mormonism?
[9107.70s -> 9108.73s]  Is it?
[9108.73s -> 9109.61s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[9109.61s -> 9112.79s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[9112.79s -> 9113.27s]  What do you mean?
[9113.35s -> 9114.23s]  What are you talking about?
[9114.23s -> 9142.79s]  Wait, Mormons, Mormons, you create planets?
[9142.79s -> 9143.91s]  Making planets?
[9143.91s -> 9148.22s]  You become a god and make a planet.
[9148.22s -> 9172.39s]  You get your own planet that you were the god of when you die.
[9173.27s -> 9177.78s]  You and your first wife get a planet.
[9177.78s -> 9178.82s]  That sounds fucking awesome.
[9184.68s -> 9185.48s]  That's sick.
[9186.76s -> 9190.12s]  That's fucking sick.
[9190.12s -> 9191.32s]  Wait, I just said a bad word.
[9191.32s -> 9192.76s]  Is that bad?
[9192.76s -> 9193.88s]  I don't think I can do it anymore.
[9193.88s -> 9196.52s]  Oh, well, I was a Mormon for five seconds.
[9196.52s -> 9210.71s]  My name is, you see, everyone who comes to these,
[9210.71s -> 9218.23s]  they feel that they are no longer in control of something important.
[9218.79s -> 9224.41s]  Now you don't get a planet minus one planet.
[9224.41s -> 9238.94s]  But news to see our problems from it.
[9238.94s -> 9243.74s]  So we do the same things again and again and again.
[9243.74s -> 9245.69s]  They're in, of course.
[9245.69s -> 9248.49s]  We find exactly the failure we were looking for.
[9267.83s -> 9269.43s]  You guys are fucking hilarious.
[9269.43s -> 9279.26s]  Whatever doesn't work like that.
[9279.82s -> 9283.74s]  Somebody said, hey, dude, you could have my planet like when I'm gone.
[9284.22s -> 9285.90s]  You can't just give the planet.
[9285.90s -> 9287.10s]  That's not how it works.
[9287.10s -> 9290.66s]  You can't just give me your planet because you went through all the
[9290.66s -> 9292.26s]  you were a faithful person.
[9292.26s -> 9293.06s]  That's not how it works.
[9306.38s -> 9307.18s]  There's a bug in here.
[9320.07s -> 9330.87s]  A lot of chess themes that we persevered.
[9331.77s -> 9333.05s]  We took different ways.
[9333.05s -> 9335.21s]  We we made our own path.
[9337.82s -> 9343.90s]  And here's a planet just for you.
[9343.90s -> 9351.00s]  A few minutes, you'll be back in the room.
[9351.00s -> 9354.12s]  Some part of you will say that none of this was real.
[9354.76s -> 9357.64s]  So how could it have really meant anything?
[9357.64s -> 9361.80s]  But just like the power of perspective itself,
[9362.44s -> 9365.64s]  it will have been as real as you believed it to be.
[9367.08s -> 9369.40s]  All you've got to do is wait.
[9376.81s -> 9384.06s]  That was a good game.
[9384.06s -> 9386.47s]  That was really good.
[9387.19s -> 9389.19s]  That was a nice few hour experience.
[9389.19s -> 9389.99s]  That's cool.
[9389.99s -> 9392.42s]  I very much enjoyed that.
[9392.42s -> 9400.82s]  That's good.
[9400.82s -> 9407.32s]  Go back to Mythbusters.
[9407.32s -> 9409.00s]  I'm not going to do that.
[9409.00s -> 9410.09s]  That game was cute.
[9410.81s -> 9411.45s]  What's wrong with it?
[9411.45s -> 9417.05s]  Nothing wrong with it.
[9417.05s -> 9427.98s]  I like this song.
[9427.98s -> 9428.86s]  Long stream.
[9428.86s -> 9431.10s]  Um, not long at all, actually.
[9440.78s -> 9442.62s]  This started at 7 p.m.
[9442.62s -> 9444.06s]  This is a late night stream.
[9444.06s -> 9445.56s]  So I didn't go long.
[9445.56s -> 9446.44s]  Pretty normal length.
[9446.44s -> 9449.90s]  Five hours or so.
[9449.90s -> 9450.38s]  That's cool.
[9452.12s -> 9453.08s]  Here's the plan for this week.
[9453.08s -> 9455.48s]  Uh, I'm not going to stream tomorrow,
[9455.48s -> 9458.22s]  but I'll be live the next day.
[9458.22s -> 9461.40s]  We I'll be live on well tomorrow.
[9461.40s -> 9461.96s]  Okay.
[9461.96s -> 9464.92s]  So technically we're talking about Thursday is when I'm streaming.
[9464.92s -> 9466.86s]  So I'm not streaming today.
[9466.86s -> 9467.50s]  Wednesday.
[9467.50s -> 9468.94s]  Technically, I'm streaming on Thursday.
[9468.94s -> 9471.08s]  I'm going to play multiverses.
[9471.08s -> 9473.16s]  I think it's going to be sponsored.
[9473.16s -> 9477.67s]  It's going to be I'm going to be playing a lot of gizmo.
[9477.67s -> 9481.85s]  I'm actually looking really forward to it.
[9481.85s -> 9482.81s]  Morty came out too.
[9482.81s -> 9485.13s]  I didn't play it, but I'm you bet your ass.
[9485.13s -> 9488.90s]  I want to play it when gizmos out.
[9488.90s -> 9492.17s]  Uh, that is not the only thing we're going to do.
[9492.17s -> 9496.14s]  We will do something else as well from gremlins.
[9496.14s -> 9497.61s]  Yep.
[9497.61s -> 9500.25s]  Gizmo from gremlins is going to be in multiverses.
[9501.21s -> 9502.97s]  I whenever they put it in.
[9503.53s -> 9518.98s]  How come you don't have a graphic tea of gremlins too?
[9518.98s -> 9520.73s]  They don't even make them.
[9520.73s -> 9521.05s]  Do they?
[9521.05s -> 9525.46s]  I mean, I don't know.
[9525.46s -> 9527.14s]  Yeah, we'll play multiverses and we'll do something else.
[9527.14s -> 9527.54s]  Maybe.
[9527.54s -> 9528.26s]  I don't know.
[9528.26s -> 9532.98s]  I would say sorcery, but kind of want that to be its own thing.
[9535.74s -> 9537.58s]  We'll start with something else.
[9538.22s -> 9539.66s]  We'll move to multiverses.
[9541.03s -> 9545.82s]  So for those of you that don't, uh, not into multiverses, that's fine.
[9545.82s -> 9546.78s]  We'll start with something else.
[9546.78s -> 9547.82s]  We'll move on to multiverses.
[9547.82s -> 9549.74s]  Although I, I mean, obviously it's a sponsored stream.
[9549.74s -> 9557.48s]  So you, uh, you know, come, come hang out, split tune,
[9557.48s -> 9567.93s]  but we'll do something for a little bit before.
[9567.93s -> 9568.17s]  Yeah.
[9568.17s -> 9571.45s]  I have no idea if gizmo is coming out or not.
[9571.45s -> 9574.02s]  I know that he's supposed to soon.
[9574.02s -> 9584.25s]  I'm going to have wicked.
[9584.25s -> 9585.05s]  Yeah, they already announced it.
[9585.05s -> 9592.94s]  They announced gizmo, but Disney infinity.
[9592.94s -> 9594.38s]  Is it September 8th?
[9594.38s -> 9596.94s]  I that's a, I hope so.
[9596.94s -> 9601.08s]  I'm under the impression that it was happening soon.
[9601.08s -> 9604.31s]  Make a tier list.
[9604.31s -> 9607.91s]  I'm not going to read that stream sooner.
[9608.15s -> 9609.91s]  This is not a normal stream time for me.
[9609.91s -> 9612.34s]  This is completely out of the ordinary.
[9612.34s -> 9616.22s]  I just had stuff going on this afternoon.
[9616.22s -> 9620.81s]  Uh, you can expect most streams to start somewhere around three or four Pacific,
[9620.81s -> 9626.94s]  which is exactly precisely when we will start playing, um, on Thursday.
[9626.94s -> 9629.24s]  We'll start around four o'clock.
[9629.24s -> 9631.00s]  We'll move to multiverses.
[9631.00s -> 9634.97s]  Probably around maybe some, but there might be around six or seven.
[9634.97s -> 9636.90s]  Maybe play that for a few hours.
[9636.90s -> 9640.92s]  He was supposed to be out today.
[9640.92s -> 9641.08s]  Okay.
[9641.08s -> 9642.68s]  Well, then that makes sense.
[9642.68s -> 9651.06s]  Or is too late.
[9651.06s -> 9653.72s]  Not for me.
[9653.72s -> 9656.44s]  Not for me.
[9656.44s -> 9656.76s]  All right.
[9656.76s -> 9657.32s]  That's it guys.
[9657.32s -> 9658.20s]  I'll see you later.
[9658.20s -> 9660.41s]  I'll see you on Thursday.
[9660.41s -> 9664.31s]  Uh, I'm glad to kind of be back to normal now.
[9664.31s -> 9666.42s]  Just kind of hanging out.
[9666.42s -> 9668.47s]  Although name your price was a ton of fun.
[9668.47s -> 9669.19s]  And hey, Donna was too.
[9669.19s -> 9671.94s]  If you didn't see that, uh, that was a blast.
[9671.94s -> 9673.86s]  I had a ton of fun on those streams.
[9673.86s -> 9675.53s]  That was a lot of fun.
[9675.53s -> 9679.13s]  Austin is awesome.
[9679.13s -> 9687.05s]  It's actually the first time I've really spent any significant time with Austin.
[9687.05s -> 9689.62s]  And will too, for that matter.
[9689.62s -> 9690.74s]  I hung out with him.
[9690.74s -> 9696.33s]  I talked to them briefly at the streamer awards and we said,
[9696.33s -> 9698.25s]  oh yeah, we'll do something together sometime.
[9698.25s -> 9698.65s]  Cool.
[9698.65s -> 9698.97s]  Yeah.
[9698.97s -> 9699.13s]  Yeah.
[9699.13s -> 9700.73s]  And it's like, oh, let's do this.
[9700.73s -> 9701.53s]  They have that show.
[9701.53s -> 9703.61s]  We got, hey, Donna, we got, uh, name your price.
[9703.61s -> 9704.81s]  And I'm like, fucking let's go.
[9704.81s -> 9714.41s]  You had sensational drip.
[9714.41s -> 9714.73s]  Yeah.
[9714.73s -> 9716.28s]  Uh, they're awesome.
[9716.28s -> 9718.36s]  It was really cool to, uh, participate in their shows.
[9718.36s -> 9719.88s]  I thought they were really well made.
[9719.88s -> 9721.45s]  They were really well done.
[9721.45s -> 9725.91s]  So it was a good experience.
[9725.91s -> 9726.15s]  All right.
[9726.15s -> 9727.27s]  I'll see you guys later.
[9727.27s -> 9728.68s]  Take care of yourselves.
[9728.68s -> 9729.24s]  Goodbye.
[9729.24s -> 9729.96s]  Good night.
[9729.96s -> 9730.86s]  Probably mother.
[9730.86s -> 9731.66s]  You know the deal.
[9731.66s -> 9746.81s]  Oh, also when I jumped up on the chair and freaked everybody out,
[9746.81s -> 9748.60s]  I saw somebody commented.
[9748.60s -> 9752.50s]  I saw a comment saying, guys, maybe he can dodge a battle X.
[9754.60s -> 9755.56s]  So now you believe me.
[9755.56s -> 9771.03s]  I'm glad I'm convincing you, uh, more and more every day.
[9771.03s -> 9771.99s]  I saw that comment.
[9771.99s -> 9773.27s]  I saw it had some upvotes.
[9773.27s -> 9775.67s]  I was like, yes, yes, you get it.
[9775.67s -> 9782.86s]  Glad you didn't eat shit.
[9782.86s -> 9787.37s]  No, I wouldn't.
[9787.37s -> 9787.93s]  I wouldn't.
[9787.93s -> 9792.41s]  I might have some pain issues in my kind of upper chest and back,
[9792.41s -> 9794.47s]  but I can still move.
[9794.47s -> 9795.75s]  I can still move buster.
[9795.75s -> 9815.37s]  That was a weird laugh.
[9815.37s -> 9815.77s]  I'm sorry.
[9815.77s -> 9818.01s]  And usually there's music to mask how weird that would sound,
[9818.01s -> 9819.21s]  but not right now.
[9819.21s -> 9825.66s]  That was like, I'll give you my planet.
[9825.66s -> 9829.14s]  I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[9829.14s -> 9830.18s]  Take care of yourselves.
[9830.18s -> 9831.46s]  Good night.
[9831.46s -> 9880.41s]  Goodbye.
