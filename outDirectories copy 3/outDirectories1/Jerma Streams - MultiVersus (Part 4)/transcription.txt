[6.01s -> 10.17s]  What are you guys betting on? Betting on something? Betting on what?
[10.17s -> 19.00s]  Predict the coin flip. Oh, it's a coin flip. Free stream coin flip. Okay.
[20.02s -> 27.69s]  Hello. Welcome back, everybody. I wanted to stream yesterday, but I didn't.
[28.25s -> 34.70s]  I'm still kind of dealing with some problems medically, and it's...
[35.66s -> 37.75s]  We're gonna just take it easy. We're gonna take it slow.
[40.50s -> 44.66s]  I'm trying to make sure that by the baseball stream, I'm ready to go.
[45.46s -> 50.81s]  I talked a little bit in free stream about it, but there is a lot of stuff going on.
[51.37s -> 53.91s]  Let's go over... Wait, hold on. I gotta wait for people to get here.
[54.47s -> 58.66s]  Say you're sorry now. No, I'm not going to apologize.
[59.30s -> 63.62s]  I'm not going to apologize for what? What am I saying sorry for?
[65.35s -> 68.36s]  No, no apologies. I didn't do anything wrong.
[69.08s -> 72.98s]  And I'm getting wicked defensive. I'm getting wicked defensive about it already.
[76.36s -> 79.00s]  We're worried. Don't... I'm fine. Don't worry. I'll be all right.
[80.52s -> 84.87s]  Don't be... Don't worry. But here's what's going on today.
[85.94s -> 87.22s]  Something really cool.
[90.95s -> 96.30s]  We got a multi versus tournament that I'm going to be participating in.
[96.86s -> 100.57s]  Ludwig put it together. I think I'm ready to play.
[102.10s -> 102.98s]  That's what we're doing today.
[104.90s -> 110.42s]  Tomorrow, still think it's planned to do the Call of Duty thing with myth.
[110.42s -> 112.50s]  We'll see how that goes.
[114.01s -> 117.90s]  If anything's changing, I'll let you know in free stream by tomorrow.
[117.90s -> 125.51s]  Friday, we're going to play two point campus as a... Excuse me. Sponsor stream.
[127.21s -> 130.49s]  And then Sunday is green screen movie night part two.
[130.49s -> 132.01s]  Ain't going to cancel on you on Sunday.
[134.78s -> 137.66s]  Ain't going to cancel on you on Sunday. I can guarantee you that.
[143.02s -> 148.62s]  And then Monday, we're going to do a free baseball hype stream
[150.20s -> 153.80s]  where I kind of just shout it out a lot, talk about it, hang out for an hour or two.
[154.94s -> 156.70s]  And then baseball is next week.
[158.44s -> 159.88s]  That's the plan for this week here.
[165.62s -> 168.26s]  Please wear the same red sock shirt that you wore last time.
[172.70s -> 173.82s]  Yeah, there's your plan.
[176.54s -> 178.54s]  If anything changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.
[179.26s -> 183.56s]  Wait, baseball is next week. Yes.
[189.05s -> 193.80s]  Baseball is next week, the 19th of August.
[193.80s -> 204.92s]  Do you have a Discord update for it? I don't know.
[207.11s -> 209.19s]  So anyways, we're going to play. I'm going to warm up a little bit.
[213.46s -> 215.78s]  Play some multiverses. Get ready, because this is a tournament.
[216.42s -> 217.78s]  I got to be ready for it.
[217.78s -> 221.77s]  Happy birthday, Andy.
[227.32s -> 229.40s]  Is sorcery over? No, of course not.
[232.12s -> 235.00s]  I just... I was going to be very busy this week into next week.
[236.09s -> 239.21s]  So when we come back from baseball, we'll do some chill sorcery stuff.
[239.21s -> 240.41s]  We'll continue part three. Don't worry.
[242.14s -> 244.70s]  Called the Lamb Mortuary Assistant.
[244.70s -> 246.14s]  There's stuff that I want to play.
[246.78s -> 250.46s]  I'm just to the brim right now.
[250.46s -> 256.14s]  You sound like you're going to sell me a vacuum.
[257.43s -> 258.07s]  Would it work?
[259.86s -> 263.06s]  If I held a vacuum up to you right now and I was like, this is $300.
[263.06s -> 264.42s]  Give me the money. Would you give it to me?
[273.16s -> 274.84s]  Is this slow pitch softball?
[276.84s -> 279.16s]  I don't know where you heard softball.
[279.16s -> 280.68s]  This is a baseball game.
[281.32s -> 283.62s]  This is a baseball game.
[283.62s -> 284.82s]  What do you mean, softball?
[284.82s -> 286.34s]  This is a baseball game.
[286.98s -> 291.66s]  We told you that you got wrong information.
[292.30s -> 297.75s]  Somebody just ask, what's the difference?
[302.34s -> 305.22s]  There's a big difference between how softball and baseball is played.
[307.37s -> 309.69s]  Very slight differences, but there are a lot.
[313.14s -> 314.66s]  It's the same exact concept.
[315.30s -> 320.81s]  All right, let me let me do some warm up games.
[320.81s -> 321.53s]  I got to get this.
[321.53s -> 326.71s]  I got to lose to like five people in a row before we get started here.
[326.71s -> 328.23s]  I don't know when the tournament's starting.
[328.23s -> 331.67s]  I know it's starting at some point today, the next probably like half hour hour.
[332.47s -> 335.51s]  I definitely want to at least play a little bit and get ready.
[335.51s -> 337.67s]  Because I don't want to get embarrassed on this street.
[337.67s -> 338.23s]  You know what I mean?
[344.12s -> 344.92s]  Let me get in.
[345.82s -> 346.62s]  All right, let's do some.
[347.82s -> 350.49s]  I'm gonna do some 1v1s to warm up.
[350.49s -> 353.94s]  Oh, no, I'll do maybe free for all so people don't make fun of me.
[354.97s -> 356.09s]  No, 1v1, let's go.
[356.73s -> 369.37s]  Move this and hello.
[370.58s -> 371.06s]  Look at that.
[372.97s -> 374.17s]  I'll put the cam on in a minute.
[375.67s -> 377.67s]  All right, who should I play in the tournament?
[377.67s -> 378.47s]  What do you think?
[378.47s -> 382.66s]  How many turkeys could you fit in your garage?
[382.66s -> 383.78s]  What are you talking about?
[383.78s -> 385.46s]  What a what a weird question.
[385.46s -> 386.42s]  I was gonna say dumb.
[387.14s -> 388.50s]  What a dumb question.
[389.62s -> 391.86s]  Who should I play in the tournament?
[391.86s -> 393.62s]  All right, I got a good LeBron.
[393.62s -> 396.26s]  I got a good bugs and I got a good Superman.
[397.30s -> 399.30s]  We're not testing new characters today.
[399.30s -> 402.54s]  Should I practice bugs or practice Superman?
[402.54s -> 407.35s]  I'm not going to play a character I haven't played with.
[421.51s -> 422.71s]  Where's the handsome?
[422.71s -> 424.47s]  What's the handsome streamer?
[424.47s -> 426.31s]  I'm working on it.
[427.93s -> 428.73s]  Please play LeBron.
[428.73s -> 430.65s]  Well, it depends on who my partner's playing it.
[430.65s -> 433.48s]  You want the camera?
[434.04s -> 434.84s]  Fine.
[434.84s -> 438.57s]  And it's against Jake right off the bat.
[438.57s -> 440.17s]  Can't wait to get mad already.
[440.17s -> 442.70s]  All right, I need to put one on here.
[445.21s -> 445.93s]  That one definitely.
[447.14s -> 448.58s]  All right, these are practice rounds.
[448.58s -> 449.30s]  I'm not going to get mad.
[449.94s -> 451.46s]  I'm not going to get pissed off.
[451.46s -> 455.85s]  This is warm up rounds.
[455.85s -> 460.01s]  Greasy, Greasy Gary.
[460.01s -> 465.66s]  Villain hair.
[465.66s -> 466.86s]  You have copper hair.
[467.66s -> 468.78s]  It kind of is.
[468.78s -> 471.02s]  It does look like it's been at a fucking like aluminum.
[472.49s -> 473.13s]  All right, here we go.
[474.09s -> 477.40s]  One, two, three, go.
[478.12s -> 494.58s]  What the fuck?
[494.58s -> 495.38s]  What's going on?
[495.38s -> 508.17s]  That's why I got to warm up.
[508.17s -> 508.81s]  Warm up around.
[533.69s -> 533.93s]  What?
[589.78s -> 592.98s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[594.26s -> 594.66s]  Shut up.
[599.43s -> 607.56s]  Dude, what the?
[607.56s -> 609.40s]  Finally, the guy goes flying.
[609.40s -> 610.36s]  Took a hundred years.
[638.92s -> 639.64s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[666.86s -> 668.54s]  Oh, my God, he almost just dropped down on himself.
[670.97s -> 672.01s]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[672.01s -> 672.57s]  All right.
[672.57s -> 673.13s]  Shake it off.
[674.25s -> 675.69s]  This first match I played in two weeks.
[676.33s -> 676.73s]  Relax.
[679.32s -> 681.08s]  That's the first match I played in two and a half weeks.
[681.08s -> 681.48s]  Relax.
[687.42s -> 690.90s]  Your hair is greasier than by McDonald's order.
[690.90s -> 694.84s]  Yeah, it's because like, dude, what do you think I do in the morning?
[694.84s -> 713.88s]  I go get the vegetable oil and I like, then I just go like, I don't do that.
[713.88s -> 714.28s]  Don't.
[714.28s -> 715.24s]  That's a joke.
[715.24s -> 721.78s]  Please don't actually do that.
[721.78s -> 722.58s]  I believe that.
[722.58s -> 722.82s]  Don't.
[723.46s -> 724.34s]  Please don't do that.
[725.78s -> 726.34s]  All right.
[726.34s -> 726.82s]  We got that.
[726.82s -> 727.30s]  We got one.
[727.30s -> 727.62s]  We got one.
[727.62s -> 728.34s]  That was a good match.
[728.34s -> 728.98s]  It was a good fight.
[729.54s -> 731.40s]  Let's do some LeBron.
[731.40s -> 733.98s]  What's up, doc?
[733.98s -> 734.86s]  Vegetable oil.
[736.25s -> 739.43s]  Your hair looks like a helmet.
[739.43s -> 745.10s]  It's called getting out of the shower and just letting it dry.
[745.82s -> 751.85s]  You need to practice bugs.
[753.61s -> 755.05s]  I got to just get back into the game, man.
[764.52s -> 765.80s]  Dude, your brain is exposed.
[767.08s -> 767.48s]  What do you mean?
[767.48s -> 768.36s]  Like, just right here?
[768.36s -> 773.62s]  Like, let me hold on.
[773.62s -> 774.02s]  Let me jump in.
[774.02s -> 775.30s]  I got to get in my Discord call.
[780.63s -> 781.75s]  I think I'm going Superman.
[781.75s -> 782.95s]  I think I'm going straight up Superman.
[789.08s -> 789.96s]  Your hair looks fine.
[789.96s -> 790.36s]  No, I know.
[792.33s -> 793.53s]  It's shiny because of the light.
[793.53s -> 797.88s]  I got a light in my face, man.
[797.88s -> 798.76s]  All right.
[798.76s -> 801.24s]  That was a good fight against Jake the dog.
[806.89s -> 807.37s]  Okay.
[807.37s -> 809.48s]  I'll probably get this one more in.
[809.48s -> 809.72s]  All right.
[809.72s -> 810.36s]  Let's make this a good one.
[810.36s -> 810.76s]  Here we go.
[810.76s -> 811.00s]  Ready?
[811.00s -> 812.20s]  Let me just turn around and not look the other way.
[812.20s -> 812.36s]  What?
[812.36s -> 812.76s]  Check this out.
[812.76s -> 812.84s]  Ready?
[812.84s -> 813.56s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[821.75s -> 821.99s]  You.
[823.27s -> 824.62s]  I didn't want to do that.
[825.42s -> 825.66s]  I'm good.
[825.66s -> 826.46s]  I think I'm warming up now.
[846.76s -> 847.40s]  What?
[847.40s -> 848.12s]  Nobody sees that.
[848.12s -> 848.36s]  Come on.
[848.36s -> 848.76s]  Give me a break.
[862.28s -> 868.84s]  Oh, that was pretty risky.
[912.63s -> 913.67s]  Oh, that would have been good.
[915.10s -> 915.42s]  Got it.
[935.51s -> 936.47s]  Oh, come on, Gwen.
[977.85s -> 1000.47s]  Oh, that is going to jump.
[1000.47s -> 1001.91s]  Taking it to the sky.
[1001.91s -> 1002.23s]  Sorry.
[1002.23s -> 1002.47s]  Sorry.
[1002.47s -> 1002.71s]  We're good.
[1002.71s -> 1003.03s]  We're good.
[1003.03s -> 1004.39s]  We're good.
[1004.39s -> 1031.50s]  Shit.
[1038.30s -> 1039.50s]  I thought I didn't dodge through that.
[1040.46s -> 1041.42s]  Holy shit.
[1042.06s -> 1043.58s]  How did I not dodge through the grab?
[1044.30s -> 1046.94s]  I dodged through the grab.
[1046.94s -> 1047.18s]  What?
[1048.65s -> 1049.45s]  That was fucked up.
[1052.49s -> 1052.73s]  What?
[1055.29s -> 1057.05s]  When he went for the grab, I went.
[1057.13s -> 1058.49s]  I didn't dodge through it.
[1058.49s -> 1062.01s]  I lost it pretty hard at the end there.
[1062.01s -> 1066.74s]  Sorry.
[1066.74s -> 1067.54s]  You actually threw?
[1068.10s -> 1071.43s]  No, I just got combo'd.
[1071.43s -> 1072.31s]  Too much grease.
[1076.20s -> 1077.00s]  Here comes the heat.
[1078.79s -> 1080.79s]  It was the I-Frames.
[1080.79s -> 1081.67s]  That was weird.
[1081.67s -> 1083.19s]  I seriously thought I went right through.
[1083.19s -> 1085.32s]  That threw me off.
[1085.32s -> 1085.72s]  I think.
[1087.70s -> 1088.26s]  Wait, hold on.
[1088.26s -> 1088.58s]  Wait, wait.
[1088.58s -> 1090.18s]  I got to put friend code stuff in.
[1090.18s -> 1090.50s]  Hold on.
[1092.66s -> 1093.38s]  Dude, it used to be good.
[1093.38s -> 1094.10s]  What happened?
[1094.10s -> 1095.78s]  This is the second game I played in three weeks.
[1096.50s -> 1105.74s]  Ban that person for 700 days.
[1105.74s -> 1106.14s]  What up?
[1106.70s -> 1108.18s]  Let's see if you can...
[1108.18s -> 1109.14s]  Can we hear Connor?
[1109.14s -> 1109.46s]  Hello.
[1109.46s -> 1110.10s]  Can you hear me?
[1110.10s -> 1112.42s]  By the way, guys, Connor eats pants as the teammate.
[1112.42s -> 1112.98s]  Big reveal.
[1113.78s -> 1114.66s]  Hello, it's me.
[1117.62s -> 1118.42s]  Did they not know?
[1118.42s -> 1119.78s]  Did they not know that until now?
[1119.78s -> 1120.82s]  I don't think so.
[1120.82s -> 1123.26s]  I think some people do, but not everybody.
[1123.26s -> 1124.14s]  It was a secret.
[1124.14s -> 1124.94s]  It was a big secret.
[1126.02s -> 1128.44s]  So who do you play with?
[1128.44s -> 1133.88s]  I play Tom and Jerry and I can play LeBron, Iron Giant.
[1133.88s -> 1135.72s]  I can play a good bit of people, I think.
[1135.72s -> 1137.40s]  I just lost two games in a row warming up.
[1137.40s -> 1139.56s]  I haven't played in like three weeks, though, so that's all right.
[1139.56s -> 1140.04s]  That's fine.
[1140.04s -> 1140.68s]  That's good.
[1140.68s -> 1142.28s]  Oh, how's it going, gentlemen?
[1142.28s -> 1143.16s]  God, I thought that was you.
[1144.44s -> 1145.08s]  Yeah.
[1145.08s -> 1146.68s]  Connor, I thought you changed voices.
[1146.68s -> 1147.48s]  I was like, what happened?
[1148.92s -> 1149.56s]  What's up, man?
[1151.32s -> 1152.12s]  Not much.
[1152.12s -> 1153.80s]  I made a song today.
[1153.80s -> 1156.60s]  Yeah, you were working on a music career, right?
[1157.16s -> 1157.56s]  Uh-huh.
[1157.56s -> 1159.32s]  And I'm proud of it.
[1159.32s -> 1160.68s]  And that's all.
[1160.68s -> 1161.72s]  So it was a great day for me.
[1162.60s -> 1166.01s]  Yeah, we're talking strategy.
[1167.45s -> 1168.65s]  FL player, it's a whole thing.
[1168.65s -> 1173.53s]  But anyway, I just need one of you guys to Discord stream if possible.
[1173.53s -> 1174.41s]  Just so I can see.
[1174.41s -> 1175.29s]  It's also OK.
[1175.85s -> 1178.25s]  It's super impossible, but I thought I'd throw it out there.
[1179.32s -> 1181.56s]  Every time I've tried to do that, it crashes my OBS.
[1181.56s -> 1182.04s]  It sucks.
[1182.04s -> 1183.64s]  Terma, that's bad for you.
[1183.64s -> 1184.52s]  Connor, what about you?
[1184.52s -> 1186.20s]  Surely this won't crash my OBS.
[1187.00s -> 1187.88s]  Surely not.
[1192.50s -> 1196.31s]  I got to get your friend code or friend name, Connor.
[1196.31s -> 1196.63s]  Oh, yeah.
[1196.63s -> 1200.39s]  Bunch of friend names in general, Chad, that you should add as well.
[1200.39s -> 1201.43s]  One sec.
[1201.43s -> 1204.26s]  Wait, there's friend codes or just names?
[1204.26s -> 1205.54s]  I think it's just names, right?
[1205.54s -> 1207.14s]  Your WB name.
[1207.14s -> 1213.64s]  So should we be adding everybody?
[1213.72s -> 1214.20s]  He left.
[1214.20s -> 1214.60s]  I don't know.
[1215.16s -> 1218.42s]  He went to go hang out with his more popular friends.
[1218.42s -> 1220.18s]  Let me add you.
[1220.18s -> 1221.94s]  He went to go talk to Psychuno.
[1223.83s -> 1224.23s]  All right.
[1224.23s -> 1227.51s]  My name is Scarlet Otter something.
[1227.51s -> 1228.55s]  You'll see it.
[1228.55s -> 1230.07s]  Scarlet Otter something?
[1230.07s -> 1230.63s]  It's something weird.
[1233.40s -> 1235.00s]  He could get one free name change.
[1236.01s -> 1236.57s]  Do you really?
[1237.21s -> 1238.09s]  I think so.
[1238.09s -> 1239.69s]  I send you a request and then I'm going to...
[1239.69s -> 1240.57s]  Should I add you to a party?
[1241.45s -> 1242.73s]  Should we be together in a party?
[1243.45s -> 1244.09s]  I don't know.
[1245.27s -> 1246.63s]  Oh, I see Scarlet Otter.
[1246.63s -> 1251.94s]  There we go.
[1251.94s -> 1252.42s]  OK, cool.
[1254.82s -> 1257.88s]  Yeah, someone took my username.
[1257.88s -> 1260.20s]  So I had to be Connor from Dream SMP instead.
[1262.57s -> 1264.33s]  Why is it recommending me Shaggy?
[1264.33s -> 1266.33s]  Like I just downloaded the game 10 minutes ago.
[1266.97s -> 1268.09s]  Try out this.
[1268.09s -> 1269.37s]  You must have some bad games.
[1269.37s -> 1271.77s]  It was like you should try out this guy instead.
[1271.77s -> 1272.57s]  I did all right.
[1272.57s -> 1276.25s]  I did OK.
[1276.25s -> 1276.65s]  I love it.
[1276.65s -> 1277.21s]  Do you like this game?
[1277.21s -> 1278.01s]  You having fun?
[1278.01s -> 1279.05s]  I think it's super cool.
[1279.05s -> 1279.69s]  I like it a lot.
[1281.86s -> 1282.66s]  Play Rhyme Dog.
[1282.66s -> 1284.66s]  No, if we play Rhyme Dog, no one's going to watch us.
[1284.66s -> 1286.42s]  They're going to be like, oh, these guys play Rhyme Dog.
[1286.42s -> 1287.46s]  No one cares.
[1287.46s -> 1288.02s]  All right, shoot.
[1288.02s -> 1288.58s]  Who's going to leave?
[1288.58s -> 1289.22s]  Superman or Bugs?
[1289.22s -> 1289.72s]  What do you think?
[1291.64s -> 1292.68s]  Which one do you like more?
[1293.34s -> 1293.98s]  I don't know.
[1293.98s -> 1297.58s]  I feel like I like Bugs, but I feel like OK, we're going with Bugs.
[1298.14s -> 1304.14s]  So now I think we have to change to like a custom game, right?
[1304.14s -> 1304.62s]  I don't know.
[1305.50s -> 1308.30s]  Do we practice or do we just immediately jump into it?
[1309.42s -> 1310.86s]  Let's see what Lubbock says.
[1310.86s -> 1315.26s]  I got my tea.
[1315.26s -> 1316.68s]  Are you a tea?
[1316.68s -> 1317.72s]  Yeah, green tea.
[1317.72s -> 1319.99s]  I don't have any green tea.
[1319.99s -> 1320.79s]  Green tea.
[1320.79s -> 1322.46s]  I'm going to be honest.
[1322.46s -> 1324.78s]  I was going to do like I was going to plan a funny bit for you.
[1325.02s -> 1327.66s]  Like you'd have like some funny jokes where I was going to put like
[1327.66s -> 1329.82s]  Tom and Jerry sound effects on the soundboard.
[1329.82s -> 1331.86s]  Oh, that would have been pretty funny.
[1331.86s -> 1335.78s]  And then it turns out I misplanned my timing for this.
[1335.78s -> 1337.56s]  And I thought this started in an hour.
[1337.56s -> 1342.44s]  And so I was I was actually doing my one like contractual dream SMP thing
[1342.44s -> 1344.58s]  for like a month for a little bit.
[1344.58s -> 1346.50s]  Well, I promise you I don't have it.
[1346.50s -> 1349.94s]  I have literally no gags ready for this stream.
[1349.94s -> 1351.06s]  I don't have any none.
[1351.06s -> 1354.20s]  OK, so I have zero too.
[1354.20s -> 1355.00s]  Yeah, none.
[1355.00s -> 1357.16s]  OK, we'll think of it.
[1357.16s -> 1360.36s]  If you think of something like, you know, like give a hint.
[1360.36s -> 1363.96s]  And I'll like try to we all hit the layup like we'll we'll make a joke.
[1364.60s -> 1368.58s]  If we win a game, I need you to say something.
[1368.58s -> 1370.42s]  OK, I'll think of something like.
[1370.42s -> 1372.10s]  Do you have a good Bugs Bunny impression?
[1377.86s -> 1378.84s]  That's pretty good.
[1378.84s -> 1380.47s]  It's like a bug.
[1380.47s -> 1383.03s]  That was that kind of bugs with his arms in the air like, yeah, whatever.
[1385.66s -> 1390.04s]  OK, because if we win a game, we both have to say like, yeah, what's up, doc?
[1390.04s -> 1391.64s]  At the same time, it's very important.
[1394.12s -> 1395.56s]  Yeah, it's incredibly annoying.
[1395.56s -> 1397.72s]  We have to go and join their voice call immediately.
[1399.10s -> 1405.90s]  I'm not going to leak anything, but that's very important that we do that.
[1405.90s -> 1407.90s]  Don't tell anyone or else they're going to kill us.
[1407.90s -> 1409.58s]  Don't tell anybody about sportsmanship.
[1409.58s -> 1413.32s]  I could should we do like just a warm up round?
[1413.32s -> 1414.28s]  Yeah, let's let's go on.
[1414.28s -> 1415.88s]  Let's just do a random team online.
[1415.88s -> 1416.52s]  Let's see how it goes.
[1417.16s -> 1418.44s]  I think we're on it already.
[1418.44s -> 1419.08s]  Watch us do that.
[1419.08s -> 1420.20s]  And they're like, hey, we guys out.
[1422.02s -> 1422.98s]  That's what always happens.
[1423.54s -> 1427.24s]  You played Fortnite, the Ludwig Fortnite thing, right?
[1427.24s -> 1429.32s]  Yeah, that's the first time I've ever installed Fortnite.
[1430.44s -> 1431.40s]  That's awesome.
[1431.40s -> 1434.22s]  I don't know if the Fortnite Friday sometime.
[1434.22s -> 1435.14s]  Is it fun?
[1436.09s -> 1436.89s]  I love Fortnite.
[1436.89s -> 1439.37s]  I think it's the best game.
[1439.37s -> 1440.01s]  Do you OK?
[1440.01s -> 1440.81s]  Is that you?
[1440.81s -> 1444.73s]  Do you ironically but unironically like it's a really fun game?
[1444.73s -> 1448.01s]  Like if you just if you just enjoy it casually with friends.
[1448.01s -> 1452.20s]  OK, and it's also just cool because like you just start seeing
[1452.20s -> 1454.92s]  so many different characters and you're like, oh, here's Goku.
[1454.92s -> 1457.08s]  And then there's like LeBron James.
[1457.08s -> 1459.16s]  And then there's, you know, Will Smith.
[1459.16s -> 1461.48s]  And I made this reference a while back.
[1461.56s -> 1464.68s]  Remember the old Smash Brothers Brawl character leaks?
[1465.24s -> 1467.56s]  Yeah, that is Fortnite.
[1467.56s -> 1470.12s]  Like the one that's just like a giant JPEG.
[1470.12s -> 1471.64s]  You can't even tell like what the characters are.
[1471.64s -> 1474.52s]  Yeah, the one with the one with like fucking Al Bundy on it.
[1474.52s -> 1477.90s]  Yeah, it's like that's what Fortnite is now.
[1477.90s -> 1478.38s]  Yep.
[1478.38s -> 1479.10s]  Fortnite's great.
[1480.66s -> 1481.86s]  All right, let's go for it.
[1481.86s -> 1482.58s]  Get a warm up here.
[1483.70s -> 1486.28s]  Oh, man.
[1486.92s -> 1491.18s]  So did they change the characters yet so far?
[1491.18s -> 1494.54s]  Or I think I think they've done some nerfs and some buff.
[1494.54s -> 1498.07s]  OK, surely someone in chat knows.
[1502.26s -> 1503.62s]  Is that you or was that actually Buck?
[1506.02s -> 1506.50s]  It's just me.
[1510.18s -> 1513.86s]  I could be honest, I almost just lost this point.
[1513.86s -> 1515.03s]  It's fine.
[1515.03s -> 1515.83s]  We beat these guys.
[1516.47s -> 1521.58s]  There's no way you can lose to a guy named FiercedDayMantis333.
[1521.58s -> 1522.46s]  That's like.
[1522.46s -> 1522.86s]  Are you sure?
[1522.86s -> 1524.22s]  FiercedDayMantis taken.
[1525.18s -> 1527.10s]  I mean, my name is Scarlet Otter.
[1528.54s -> 1530.38s]  That's just like the default Xbox name.
[1530.38s -> 1531.74s]  Oh, it must just be a default name.
[1531.74s -> 1532.24s]  Yeah.
[1532.78s -> 1538.81s]  Oh, we're so much better, though.
[1540.02s -> 1540.52s]  Stop it.
[1543.04s -> 1543.76s]  Back me coming in.
[1545.23s -> 1547.07s]  Oh, that's actually pretty sweet.
[1548.03s -> 1550.38s]  Oh, he's there's no way he's going to make it.
[1550.38s -> 1551.18s]  We're so much better.
[1551.82s -> 1555.76s]  What do you play in Smash Bros. usually?
[1557.84s -> 1558.32s]  Lucas.
[1559.36s -> 1560.00s]  Oh, OK.
[1560.00s -> 1561.68s]  But I mean, I don't play Smash Bros. anymore.
[1564.14s -> 1565.02s]  I stopped playing pretty much.
[1567.66s -> 1568.94s]  Yeah, I want your opinion on this.
[1568.94s -> 1571.18s]  Because everyone thinks I'm a nutcase for saying this.
[1572.14s -> 1575.34s]  So the new Smash Bros. since after Brawl,
[1576.30s -> 1579.26s]  it started doing this thing that I just can't get over.
[1579.26s -> 1580.46s]  And people go, what are you talking about?
[1580.46s -> 1582.38s]  Until they actually pay attention the next time I play it.
[1583.34s -> 1587.10s]  There are so many fucking particle effects in the new games
[1587.10s -> 1588.54s]  that I can't even tell who's playing the game.
[1590.70s -> 1591.34s]  Particle effect?
[1591.34s -> 1593.42s]  It's just when you when you hit anybody, when you move,
[1593.42s -> 1595.34s]  when you when you do a move, when you jump,
[1595.90s -> 1598.94s]  it's just like explosions of like purple green
[1598.94s -> 1600.86s]  and like orange colors all over the whole screen.
[1601.58s -> 1603.92s]  You'll notice it next time you play.
[1604.00s -> 1606.16s]  Um, 20.
[1606.88s -> 1607.28s]  Oh, OK.
[1607.28s -> 1607.84s]  Yeah.
[1607.84s -> 1609.52s]  It starts to get that way once you get that edge.
[1611.90s -> 1613.10s]  I'm telling you, I'm going to.
[1613.10s -> 1614.38s]  People are going to start to pay attention.
[1615.66s -> 1616.22s]  I believe you.
[1616.78s -> 1618.62s]  I thought you were just going to say because like Melee is better.
[1618.62s -> 1620.06s]  I was like, yeah, no, you're right.
[1620.06s -> 1622.30s]  No, but if you watch like Melee and then watch the new ones.
[1623.40s -> 1623.80s]  True.
[1623.80s -> 1626.20s]  You watch Melee and you're like, wow, this game looks great.
[1626.20s -> 1627.48s]  But there's not a bunch of like.
[1629.56s -> 1632.68s]  I'm telling you, I put on frame by frame on stream
[1632.68s -> 1634.68s]  of somebody doing a single attack.
[1635.24s -> 1636.20s]  In Smash Brothers.
[1636.92s -> 1638.76s]  And everyone was like, question marks, question marks.
[1638.76s -> 1641.00s]  And I saw like at least two to three hundred trues.
[1641.00s -> 1643.08s]  That's the worst is when like, you know, you're right
[1643.08s -> 1645.40s]  and everybody keeps question mark spamming anyways.
[1645.40s -> 1647.68s]  Like, like what I know, I'm right.
[1647.68s -> 1650.00s]  I don't need like their opinion and they're just question
[1650.00s -> 1651.52s]  marking just to be different.
[1654.83s -> 1656.19s]  I like Smash Brothers, though.
[1656.19s -> 1657.31s]  I think the game is fantastic.
[1658.11s -> 1659.07s]  I just I don't know.
[1659.07s -> 1664.04s]  It's like too much, especially when you play with more than one one v one.
[1664.68s -> 1667.00s]  It's just like, I don't even know what's what's even going on.
[1667.00s -> 1667.64s]  Yeah.
[1667.64s -> 1670.92s]  Yeah, I I've got my own opinions on Smash Brothers.
[1670.92s -> 1673.64s]  But if I get into it, I'll be talking for ranting for like an hour.
[1674.36s -> 1675.24s]  We got a link.
[1675.24s -> 1678.25s]  We got to let this run out off on generals.
[1678.81s -> 1680.65s]  I think they're starting to go in general.
[1681.45s -> 1682.17s]  All right, let's go, Joe.
[1682.17s -> 1683.29s]  Wait, can I give a speech?
[1686.43s -> 1688.59s]  I will be right now if you want.
[1688.59s -> 1689.07s]  I can.
[1689.07s -> 1689.87s]  Is that a sheep?
[1690.43s -> 1694.91s]  No, I will be shuffling the seating.
[1694.91s -> 1698.19s]  You will find out who you are playing in this event in just a few moments.
[1698.19s -> 1701.04s]  First seed place, eighth seed, so on.
[1701.04s -> 1703.04s]  It is a double elimination tournament.
[1703.04s -> 1706.48s]  So if you lose, you're not out unless you lose twice.
[1706.48s -> 1707.52s]  Then then you're out.
[1707.52s -> 1708.80s]  Get the hell out.
[1708.80s -> 1711.61s]  Should I back out right now?
[1711.61s -> 1712.57s]  It doesn't super matter.
[1712.57s -> 1714.09s]  But just listen to what I'm saying.
[1714.09s -> 1714.81s]  What, dude?
[1715.29s -> 1716.17s]  Okay, what's up?
[1716.17s -> 1716.65s]  You're fine.
[1716.65s -> 1717.29s]  You're fine.
[1717.29s -> 1721.85s]  It is an eight person double elimination bracket with fifteen thousand dollars
[1721.85s -> 1724.09s]  of prize money on the line out of my pocket.
[1725.71s -> 1728.43s]  Yes, eight thousand dollars for first place.
[1728.43s -> 1729.31s]  Four thousand each.
[1729.31s -> 1731.07s]  Five thousand for second place.
[1731.07s -> 1732.03s]  Two thousand five hundred each.
[1732.03s -> 1737.10s]  And then a final third place match for two thousand dollars total.
[1737.10s -> 1738.40s]  One thousand each.
[1738.40s -> 1738.72s]  Nice.
[1738.72s -> 1739.20s]  All right.
[1739.20s -> 1742.80s]  So fifteen thousand paid out net seven hundred thirty five days.
[1742.80s -> 1749.28s]  And what we're going to do right now is shuffle the seating to see who you are all playing
[1750.49s -> 1752.09s]  real quick before we jump in.
[1752.09s -> 1756.09s]  Do not start your next match even if your opponent's ready until I tell you.
[1756.09s -> 1758.17s]  So we're going to do all the matches at the same time.
[1758.17s -> 1758.81s]  If that makes sense.
[1759.53s -> 1760.65s]  So some people I need to catch up.
[1760.65s -> 1762.09s]  I'll just put it in the general chat.
[1763.05s -> 1764.33s]  Seating is now getting shuffled.
[1764.33s -> 1765.37s]  I'm sharing it on Discord.
[1765.37s -> 1766.41s]  You guys want to take a look?
[1766.41s -> 1768.20s]  I want to take a look.
[1768.20s -> 1769.40s]  I want to take a look.
[1769.40s -> 1771.56s]  Hop in hop because I'm doing click the button right now.
[1771.56s -> 1774.12s]  Okay, where are you playing?
[1774.12s -> 1774.60s]  You have to go.
[1774.60s -> 1776.52s]  Seating has been finalized.
[1776.52s -> 1778.12s]  Oh, the big dogs.
[1778.12s -> 1779.00s]  Here are the matchups.
[1779.00s -> 1782.84s]  You guys can enter your own Discord call, but this is who you need to match up against.
[1782.84s -> 1787.88s]  It is Stans versus Alpharad or Stans and Alpharad versus Asan and Esewa.
[1787.88s -> 1788.60s]  That's match up one.
[1788.60s -> 1789.80s]  You guys can now go to your Discords.
[1789.80s -> 1791.96s]  Oh, here we fucking go, dude.
[1792.04s -> 1793.88s]  Do we all get into the same Discord?
[1793.88s -> 1795.32s]  Do we all get into the same Discord?
[1795.32s -> 1797.88s]  You can if you want to set it up and then go back to your own.
[1797.88s -> 1799.80s]  But when you're playing, just be in your own Discord
[1799.80s -> 1802.52s]  and make sure to also be Discord sharing your gameplay.
[1804.20s -> 1807.64s]  What if your Discord chat is full of people who won't stop talking in your ear?
[1807.64s -> 1809.88s]  Then that's a mod problem.
[1810.76s -> 1813.32s]  Next up is Dock and Sheep.
[1813.32s -> 1815.24s]  You guys are going to be playing Lily and Michael.
[1817.12s -> 1818.88s]  So Dock, Sheep will be playing Lily, Michael.
[1818.88s -> 1819.52s]  Good luck, good luck.
[1819.52s -> 1820.40s]  Best of three, by the way.
[1820.40s -> 1820.96s]  Best of three.
[1822.80s -> 1826.32s]  Connor, Jerma, you guys are going to be playing Crazy Slick and Jesse.
[1828.56s -> 1832.32s]  And finally, TheValeConnell, you are playing Buddha and Saikuno.
[1834.94s -> 1840.06s]  All right, I'm going to go off, set up your games, add the friends, get it all going.
[1840.06s -> 1842.54s]  I'll add everyone to start in just a few moments.
[1842.54s -> 1843.02s]  Thanks, Ludd.
[1843.02s -> 1843.42s]  Let's do it.
[1843.42s -> 1844.14s]  Appreciate it, gamers.
[1844.14s -> 1844.54s]  Thank you.
[1845.34s -> 1846.59s]  Bye.
[1846.59s -> 1846.91s]  Bye.
[1851.07s -> 1852.91s]  All right, so where are we going?
[1852.91s -> 1854.49s]  All right, we're against Slick and Jesse.
[1854.49s -> 1855.69s]  Oh, OK.
[1855.69s -> 1856.83s]  Hey, guys.
[1856.83s -> 1857.33s]  Hey.
[1858.05s -> 1859.74s]  Hey, everybody.
[1859.74s -> 1860.30s]  What's happening?
[1861.70s -> 1862.82s]  We got to set up a lobby.
[1862.82s -> 1864.50s]  So does anyone want to do that here?
[1864.50s -> 1866.18s]  Or working on my hands?
[1866.18s -> 1866.68s]  See.
[1867.38s -> 1868.18s]  Yeah.
[1868.18s -> 1868.98s]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[1869.62s -> 1870.34s]  OK.
[1870.34s -> 1870.82s]  OK.
[1870.82s -> 1872.42s]  What are the rules?
[1872.42s -> 1873.38s]  I don't know.
[1873.38s -> 1874.18s]  Is it just four?
[1876.45s -> 1877.17s]  Did he say best?
[1879.41s -> 1881.01s]  Best of three, but what are the maps?
[1881.01s -> 1881.89s]  I don't get how that works.
[1881.89s -> 1882.21s]  Anything?
[1882.21s -> 1883.09s]  I don't really know.
[1883.09s -> 1885.09s]  Yeah, is it just any map?
[1885.09s -> 1885.59s]  Random.
[1888.34s -> 1888.66s]  I don't know.
[1888.66s -> 1889.62s]  I'm having a panic attack.
[1890.10s -> 1891.54s]  All right, so custom game.
[1891.54s -> 1893.42s]  I'll set up custom game.
[1893.42s -> 1893.90s]  OK.
[1893.90s -> 1895.18s]  And then we're doing 2v2.
[1895.18s -> 1895.66s]  Ringouts?
[1895.66s -> 1897.46s]  Are we doing four ringouts?
[1897.46s -> 1898.66s]  I'm imagining no time limit, right?
[1898.66s -> 1899.30s]  I don't know.
[1899.30s -> 1900.34s]  I don't know what the rules are.
[1900.34s -> 1901.14s]  Hazards enabled?
[1901.14s -> 1903.76s]  I'm going to go over there and see.
[1903.76s -> 1904.24s]  Yeah.
[1904.24s -> 1904.88s]  OK.
[1904.88s -> 1905.84s]  Let's get a clarification.
[1905.84s -> 1906.88s]  I'll get a clarification.
[1906.88s -> 1908.24s]  I mean, hopefully I don't bother him.
[1908.24s -> 1910.22s]  Let's see.
[1910.22s -> 1911.25s]  Going.
[1911.25s -> 1912.77s]  Let's get a prediction going.
[1912.77s -> 1913.58s]  Who wins?
[1913.58s -> 1914.78s]  Let's do it specifically, because I
[1914.78s -> 1915.74s]  think this was interesting.
[1915.74s -> 1917.26s]  Hassan Nessua stands out for it.
[1917.26s -> 1920.06s]  I think Nessua is the best player in this event.
[1920.06s -> 1921.98s]  I think Hassan is the worst player.
[1922.24s -> 1923.60s]  He's not better than me.
[1923.60s -> 1924.08s]  I got to pee.
[1924.08s -> 1924.96s]  I'll be right back.
[1924.96s -> 1925.44s]  Hey.
[1925.44s -> 1926.08s]  Oh, he's gone.
[1929.18s -> 1929.98s]  Shit.
[1929.98s -> 1931.42s]  I missed my opportunity.
[1931.42s -> 1932.46s]  I missed my opportunity.
[1934.74s -> 1936.98s]  I missed my opportunity to ask him, because he went pee.
[1938.10s -> 1938.74s]  No way.
[1940.54s -> 1941.42s]  Was it embarrassing?
[1942.46s -> 1943.42s]  Nobody responded?
[1943.42s -> 1943.74s]  Yeah.
[1943.74s -> 1944.06s]  All right.
[1944.06s -> 1944.54s]  We'll get it.
[1944.54s -> 1945.42s]  I got to get on this team.
[1945.42s -> 1946.62s]  So let me add you guys.
[1946.62s -> 1950.62s]  Zoom hazards off, and then the Scooby-Doo stage off, maybe?
[1950.62s -> 1951.82s]  Probably no time limit either, right?
[1954.10s -> 1955.14s]  Yeah, probably.
[1955.14s -> 1957.06s]  So no Scooby-Doo stage.
[1957.06s -> 1958.74s]  OK.
[1958.74s -> 1959.94s]  Yeah, no Scooby-Doo.
[1959.94s -> 1960.66s]  The mansion is.
[1961.22s -> 1962.74s]  Four ring-outs, and then I got to add you guys.
[1962.74s -> 1966.10s]  So what do you guys, you guys are going to put it in general, right?
[1966.10s -> 1967.54s]  I can invite Slick.
[1967.54s -> 1967.78s]  OK.
[1967.78s -> 1968.02s]  Yeah.
[1970.18s -> 1971.39s]  I don't see you online, Slick.
[1971.39s -> 1972.35s]  I thought I added you.
[1972.35s -> 1973.94s]  I see you.
[1976.18s -> 1979.06s]  My name is Scarlett Otter, and a bunch of random bullshit.
[1979.06s -> 1979.86s]  I'm going to add you.
[1979.86s -> 1985.28s]  There's already three of those adding me.
[1985.28s -> 1985.84s]  So you're going to have to.
[1987.04s -> 1987.68s]  Are you serious?
[1988.80s -> 1990.77s]  I was going to say, what?
[1990.77s -> 1991.49s]  Quick.
[1991.49s -> 1993.78s]  A lot of Scarlett Otter fans out there.
[1993.86s -> 1996.02s]  4366 or 4633?
[1998.26s -> 2005.41s]  I'm adding you literally right now, and I'm bringing you to the custom game right now.
[2005.41s -> 2007.84s]  I just accepted it now.
[2007.84s -> 2008.08s]  All right.
[2008.08s -> 2010.10s]  You got Slick in here, right?
[2010.10s -> 2011.22s]  Yeah, I'm in here.
[2011.22s -> 2011.72s]  OK.
[2012.58s -> 2013.30s]  OK.
[2013.30s -> 2013.70s]  He's back.
[2013.70s -> 2015.62s]  You can ask him now, maybe.
[2015.62s -> 2019.25s]  I think other people are asking questions, too.
[2019.25s -> 2021.10s]  Oh, OK.
[2021.10s -> 2021.82s]  Really fine.
[2021.82s -> 2022.62s]  Works are fine.
[2022.62s -> 2023.57s]  OK.
[2023.57s -> 2024.69s]  Hey, another question here.
[2025.49s -> 2025.89s]  Maps.
[2026.45s -> 2029.44s]  Are any maps off limits?
[2030.40s -> 2036.67s]  People saying Scooby-Doo off limits, or are we just keeping everything in?
[2036.67s -> 2039.23s]  I think we go hog wild.
[2039.87s -> 2040.43s]  Just anything.
[2041.84s -> 2042.80s]  In your counterpick.
[2044.85s -> 2045.73s]  It's a good point, Jeremy.
[2045.73s -> 2047.01s]  You brought up a great point.
[2047.01s -> 2048.69s]  You brought up an excellent point.
[2048.69s -> 2049.89s]  There are three maps that are fine.
[2049.89s -> 2050.37s]  Keep them all in.
[2050.37s -> 2050.85s]  Keep them all in.
[2050.85s -> 2051.73s]  Just keep all maps in?
[2051.73s -> 2052.13s]  You got it.
[2052.13s -> 2052.45s]  All right.
[2052.45s -> 2053.81s]  And we fear nothing but God.
[2053.81s -> 2056.69s]  And this is unlimited time, no hazards, and four ring outs, right?
[2058.46s -> 2059.42s]  Seven minutes for time.
[2059.42s -> 2061.02s]  Seven minutes for time, no hazards?
[2063.62s -> 2064.26s]  Yeah, no hazards.
[2064.26s -> 2064.90s]  No hazards.
[2064.90s -> 2065.22s]  You got it.
[2065.22s -> 2065.70s]  All right.
[2065.70s -> 2066.10s]  Cool.
[2066.10s -> 2070.85s]  Thanks.
[2070.85s -> 2071.41s]  All right.
[2071.41s -> 2071.73s]  We're good.
[2072.53s -> 2074.29s]  These are the rules that you see on the screen right now.
[2074.29s -> 2075.73s]  And by the way, all maps are in.
[2075.73s -> 2076.88s]  OK.
[2076.88s -> 2078.56s]  All maps, including Scooby-Doo.
[2078.56s -> 2080.48s]  All maps, including Scooby-Doo.
[2080.48s -> 2080.80s]  All right.
[2080.80s -> 2082.40s]  Are we playing random or what?
[2082.40s -> 2083.12s]  All right.
[2083.12s -> 2085.52s]  That's what I thought we were playing regulation, but OK.
[2085.52s -> 2087.36s]  We'll play Ludwig's Fun Rules.
[2087.36s -> 2088.96s]  It's four ring outs, and then?
[2089.60s -> 2090.08s]  Seven minutes.
[2090.08s -> 2090.94s]  OK.
[2090.94s -> 2091.42s]  OK.
[2091.42s -> 2094.83s]  But what if both teams decide no Scooby-Doo?
[2094.83s -> 2095.15s]  That's it.
[2095.15s -> 2097.62s]  Are we banning anybody?
[2097.62s -> 2098.34s]  I don't think so.
[2098.34s -> 2099.86s]  I don't know.
[2099.86s -> 2101.62s]  Is there enough people for bans?
[2101.62s -> 2104.35s]  People call me Question Andy.
[2104.35s -> 2104.83s]  I want to go.
[2104.83s -> 2107.31s]  This is a $15,000 tournament.
[2107.31s -> 2108.83s]  I don't know if I don't want to screw this up.
[2108.83s -> 2109.39s]  How much?
[2109.39s -> 2110.27s]  There's no details.
[2110.27s -> 2111.95s]  And Ludwig is really bad at running tournaments.
[2111.95s -> 2112.91s]  I'm going to have to ask him again.
[2112.91s -> 2113.31s]  I don't know.
[2114.19s -> 2115.39s]  Question Andy.
[2115.39s -> 2119.22s]  Oh, is there announcements?
[2119.22s -> 2119.78s]  What is this?
[2119.78s -> 2120.50s]  All characters?
[2120.50s -> 2121.14s]  OK, right here.
[2121.14s -> 2122.18s]  All perks are totally fine.
[2122.18s -> 2122.90s]  All stages.
[2123.46s -> 2124.74s]  Loser picks map.
[2124.74s -> 2125.30s]  What?
[2125.30s -> 2125.78s]  Question.
[2125.78s -> 2126.34s]  No hazards.
[2126.34s -> 2126.82s]  You know.
[2126.82s -> 2127.94s]  Dude, shut up.
[2127.94s -> 2128.50s]  Seven minutes.
[2128.50s -> 2128.98s]  Four stocks.
[2128.98s -> 2129.78s]  Best of three.
[2129.78s -> 2131.06s]  What do you guys play?
[2131.06s -> 2132.18s]  Loser picks map?
[2132.18s -> 2134.26s]  How do we know which one of us is the loser?
[2134.26s -> 2136.48s]  Was it random?
[2136.48s -> 2138.10s]  They put a loser in that.
[2138.10s -> 2139.54s]  Oh, was it just seeded that way?
[2139.54s -> 2141.90s]  I guess one of us is the loser.
[2141.90s -> 2143.66s]  Wait, I don't think we even pick maps.
[2143.66s -> 2144.14s]  Do we?
[2144.14s -> 2144.94s]  I don't think so.
[2144.94s -> 2146.91s]  It says loser picks maps.
[2146.91s -> 2147.79s]  I'm having a panic attack.
[2147.79s -> 2148.19s]  All right, whatever.
[2149.23s -> 2151.71s]  Maybe we don't rematch immediately.
[2151.71s -> 2154.48s]  So I'm assuming I'm not the loser.
[2154.48s -> 2155.44s]  I don't care about maps.
[2155.44s -> 2156.80s]  But it's like up to you guys.
[2156.80s -> 2157.76s]  Like, for real.
[2157.76s -> 2159.36s]  It doesn't bother me at all.
[2159.36s -> 2160.08s]  Maps don't bother me.
[2160.08s -> 2160.48s]  I don't care.
[2162.32s -> 2163.60s]  Yeah, I'm fine with whatever.
[2163.60s -> 2164.00s]  All right.
[2164.00s -> 2164.24s]  Yeah.
[2164.24s -> 2164.48s]  OK.
[2164.48s -> 2164.88s]  All right.
[2164.88s -> 2165.76s]  Well, good luck, guys.
[2165.76s -> 2166.72s]  Have fun at all.
[2166.72s -> 2168.10s]  Good luck.
[2168.18s -> 2169.78s]  So are we going to be in the same call?
[2169.78s -> 2170.90s]  Like, talking shit?
[2170.90s -> 2173.22s]  I think we're going to go separate.
[2173.22s -> 2176.18s]  Because, I mean, you know, we get in strategies.
[2176.18s -> 2177.06s]  Yeah, that's true.
[2177.06s -> 2177.70s]  That's true.
[2177.70s -> 2177.94s]  All right.
[2177.94s -> 2178.50s]  Good luck, boys.
[2178.50s -> 2179.22s]  So many questions.
[2179.22s -> 2179.46s]  All right.
[2179.46s -> 2180.02s]  Have fun, guys.
[2180.02s -> 2182.02s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[2182.02s -> 2184.56s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[2184.56s -> 2187.12s]  Hopefully, I'll see you tomorrow.
[2187.12s -> 2190.32s]  What the hell popped in this room?
[2191.04s -> 2191.84s]  Popped?
[2191.84s -> 2193.76s]  I just heard like a pop noise.
[2193.76s -> 2195.92s]  It wasn't like your graphics card, right?
[2195.92s -> 2196.64s]  I hope not.
[2197.60s -> 2199.52s]  That would be the first time my computer's blown up
[2199.52s -> 2200.56s]  while in a Ludwig tournament.
[2200.56s -> 2203.02s]  That would actually be the third time that's happened,
[2203.02s -> 2206.06s]  which is pretty impressive that that only happens with Ludwig.
[2206.06s -> 2207.02s]  Here, Connor.
[2207.02s -> 2208.26s]  Hello.
[2208.26s -> 2209.76s]  Discord screen share.
[2209.76s -> 2210.26s]  Oh.
[2218.40s -> 2219.36s]  Maybe he wants to chat.
[2219.36s -> 2220.96s]  And it's just like, oh, you know.
[2220.96s -> 2222.56s]  He's just coming in with some rules.
[2223.20s -> 2223.44s]  Yeah.
[2223.44s -> 2225.36s]  How about you share your Discord screen, Connor?
[2225.36s -> 2229.12s]  OK, fine.
[2229.12s -> 2229.44s]  All right.
[2229.44s -> 2231.28s]  I'm going to think bugs in Tom and Jerry.
[2231.28s -> 2232.00s]  Do you think that's too?
[2232.00s -> 2232.64s]  I think so.
[2232.64s -> 2235.10s]  I think we win with that.
[2235.10s -> 2237.18s]  Very, very interesting question.
[2237.18s -> 2239.10s]  What are we going to do with our money?
[2239.50s -> 2240.78s]  You're telling me to give a question.
[2240.78s -> 2241.82s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[2241.82s -> 2243.58s]  Is Tom and Jerry part of the Looney Tunes?
[2245.15s -> 2245.55s]  No.
[2245.55s -> 2245.87s]  No.
[2245.87s -> 2246.51s]  No, no, no.
[2246.51s -> 2246.99s]  No.
[2246.99s -> 2249.28s]  So they're just completely separate?
[2249.28s -> 2249.76s]  Yeah.
[2249.76s -> 2252.56s]  Were they part of a different Tom and Jerry universe?
[2252.56s -> 2253.92s]  Because there's these merry melodies, right?
[2255.82s -> 2260.08s]  I think Tom and Jerry was, I don't know, actually.
[2260.08s -> 2261.04s]  I don't know how that works.
[2261.04s -> 2262.16s]  MGM, right?
[2262.16s -> 2266.51s]  Looney Tunes had like a similar one with Sylvester and Tweety Bird, right?
[2266.51s -> 2269.17s]  Yeah, because the Looney Tunes.
[2269.17s -> 2271.41s]  Yeah, Tom and Jerry, I guess Tom and Jerry MGM, apparently.
[2271.41s -> 2272.61s]  So what else is under MGM?
[2274.88s -> 2277.86s]  I don't know.
[2277.86s -> 2281.71s]  I mean, I thought they're all owned by the same thing now, aren't they?
[2281.71s -> 2284.53s]  Yeah, they're all under one umbrella.
[2284.53s -> 2285.49s]  Animaniacs.
[2285.49s -> 2289.04s]  I like the Animaniacs.
[2289.04s -> 2291.30s]  The Wizard of Oz.
[2291.30s -> 2293.14s]  If he plays the Tin Man, that'd be amazing.
[2294.91s -> 2299.71s]  Let's put them all in.
[2299.71s -> 2303.17s]  Tom and Jerry were Hanna-Barbera.
[2303.17s -> 2306.42s]  Really?
[2306.42s -> 2307.06s]  Interesting.
[2307.06s -> 2315.92s]  Yeah, Metroid, Goldman and Mayer.
[2315.92s -> 2317.36s]  I watched so much Tom and Jerry as a kid.
[2317.36s -> 2318.56s]  It was my favorite thing.
[2318.56s -> 2322.30s]  I was a Looney Tunes guy.
[2322.30s -> 2322.94s]  Daffy Duck.
[2322.94s -> 2325.12s]  Yeah, I also did like the Looney Tunes.
[2325.12s -> 2329.04s]  I had the big VHS box set that had all of them.
[2329.04s -> 2331.23s]  I would watch as a kid.
[2331.23s -> 2334.59s]  It's crazy just how many episodes there are of all these old cartoons.
[2334.59s -> 2335.87s]  Yeah, there's so many.
[2335.87s -> 2338.03s]  People think like, oh, Dragon Ball Z has,
[2338.03s -> 2340.27s]  Dragon Ball has like fucking 700 episodes.
[2340.27s -> 2341.87s]  You know how many episodes of the Looney Tunes,
[2341.87s -> 2342.83s]  just merry melodies there are?
[2342.83s -> 2348.05s]  Probably like 1,500.
[2348.05s -> 2348.45s]  A lie.
[2348.45s -> 2349.89s]  That is more than Dragon Ball Hype up.
[2349.89s -> 2350.85s]  Yeah, it's also a lie.
[2350.85s -> 2351.33s]  I made it up.
[2351.33s -> 2353.41s]  But it's probably something huge.
[2353.41s -> 2356.85s]  The lawyers made them remove frying pan jokes in later seasons
[2356.85s -> 2360.05s]  because, quote, kids could have access to frying pans.
[2360.05s -> 2360.93s]  Oh.
[2360.93s -> 2361.81s]  Yo.
[2361.81s -> 2362.37s]  Hey.
[2362.37s -> 2362.85s]  Yo.
[2362.85s -> 2364.05s]  Apparently, we can start now.
[2364.05s -> 2364.85s]  Oh, we're starting now.
[2365.34s -> 2365.82s]  Yep, yep.
[2365.82s -> 2366.38s]  All right, good luck.
[2366.38s -> 2367.02s]  OK, cool.
[2367.02s -> 2367.90s]  Good luck, good luck.
[2367.90s -> 2374.18s]  OK, so Jerma is wrong.
[2374.18s -> 2376.18s]  There are only seven Looney Tune episodes.
[2380.02s -> 2380.50s]  Sorry.
[2380.50s -> 2381.62s]  Sorry, this might be incorrect.
[2381.62s -> 2383.94s]  No, this is not like Trigun, OK?
[2384.82s -> 2385.62s]  Give me a break.
[2385.62s -> 2387.90s]  I think there's only seven.
[2387.90s -> 2389.50s]  A bunch of people are saying that now.
[2389.50s -> 2391.76s]  All right, we're going with that same strat?
[2391.76s -> 2395.58s]  Yep, I'm ready.
[2395.58s -> 2396.46s]  All right, let's go for it.
[2396.46s -> 2398.46s]  Remember, if we win, I'm going to do a countdown.
[2398.46s -> 2400.53s]  You're going to say, what's up, Doc?
[2400.53s -> 2400.93s]  OK.
[2400.93s -> 2401.97s]  Uh-oh, we had an error.
[2401.97s -> 2405.50s]  You got what?
[2405.50s -> 2407.33s]  Does not all players are ready?
[2407.33s -> 2408.29s]  No.
[2408.29s -> 2409.41s]  Oh, ready, yeah.
[2409.41s -> 2410.58s]  I think it's you.
[2410.58s -> 2411.86s]  No, I'm ready.
[2411.86s -> 2412.98s]  I think they need to be ready.
[2412.98s -> 2413.62s]  Oh.
[2413.62s -> 2417.33s]  Oh, we need to do our perks, right?
[2417.33s -> 2418.29s]  Has anybody else in this whole tournament?
[2418.29s -> 2422.27s]  Yeah, I think we have the next screen that we do that on.
[2422.27s -> 2424.38s]  I think it broke.
[2424.38s -> 2425.82s]  Did it really break?
[2425.82s -> 2428.53s]  I think so.
[2428.53s -> 2431.10s]  Games and beta.
[2431.10s -> 2431.98s]  Yeah, this definitely broke.
[2433.97s -> 2435.33s]  What does their screen look like?
[2435.33s -> 2436.45s]  Oh, hold on.
[2436.45s -> 2438.13s]  Oh, the pleasure is...
[2438.13s -> 2439.49s]  You can reset it.
[2439.49s -> 2440.13s]  Try it again?
[2440.13s -> 2440.53s]  OK.
[2440.53s -> 2446.22s]  Yeah, surely it works this time.
[2446.22s -> 2449.23s]  Here comes the heat.
[2449.23s -> 2450.75s]  OK, try it again.
[2450.75s -> 2453.79s]  All right, we should think about perks,
[2453.79s -> 2454.51s]  because I think I have...
[2454.51s -> 2455.55s]  OK, if you say so.
[2455.55s -> 2457.23s]  We can do team perks, all right?
[2457.31s -> 2458.11s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2458.11s -> 2460.35s]  So it'll show you in this next screen what I run, I think.
[2460.35s -> 2461.28s]  I got 20%.
[2461.28s -> 2462.72s]  Is there anything that you really want?
[2464.05s -> 2466.18s]  Not really.
[2466.18s -> 2467.06s]  This is what I run.
[2467.06s -> 2469.86s]  I get projectile speed, which is good for Tom and Jerry.
[2469.86s -> 2470.10s]  Yeah.
[2470.10s -> 2472.90s]  And the air moves is pretty good.
[2475.14s -> 2477.46s]  And then the last one, air acceleration, I don't really care.
[2477.46s -> 2482.05s]  Sometimes I do the 100 damage one is pretty good.
[2482.05s -> 2485.01s]  I like this one, 20% reduction to ground and wall bounce,
[2485.01s -> 2486.94s]  so we're not just going to bounce around.
[2486.94s -> 2487.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[2487.66s -> 2488.99s]  One additional damage.
[2488.99s -> 2491.92s]  I'll run the speed one and you run the wall bounce,
[2491.92s -> 2494.00s]  because I think we still both get each other's perks.
[2494.00s -> 2496.72s]  Yeah, I think if we have the same one, it doubles up.
[2496.72s -> 2498.98s]  Yeah, it doubles it.
[2498.98s -> 2500.18s]  All right, well, let's go.
[2500.18s -> 2502.08s]  I'm running an iron giant.
[2502.08s -> 2502.32s]  OK.
[2502.32s -> 2503.12s]  Show them what we got.
[2503.94s -> 2504.26s]  OK.
[2504.82s -> 2505.14s]  All right.
[2505.14s -> 2506.74s]  They're doing iron giant.
[2506.74s -> 2507.94s]  They might cheese us.
[2507.94s -> 2509.68s]  They might cheese us here.
[2509.68s -> 2510.00s]  OK.
[2514.22s -> 2514.94s]  OK.
[2514.94s -> 2516.19s]  All right, let's go.
[2516.19s -> 2516.75s]  Let's go.
[2516.75s -> 2518.42s]  I've seen you win these.
[2518.42s -> 2519.22s]  All right, let's go.
[2519.22s -> 2519.86s]  Try hard.
[2519.86s -> 2522.16s]  Put your try hard shoes on.
[2522.16s -> 2523.44s]  I'm going to taunt right off the bat.
[2523.44s -> 2523.84s]  There we go.
[2553.01s -> 2554.53s]  Oh, you didn't expect that one, did you?
[2560.05s -> 2561.09s]  Oh, we're good.
[2561.09s -> 2561.41s]  We're good.
[2561.41s -> 2573.66s]  We're good.
[2573.66s -> 2574.30s]  Oh, shit.
[2574.30s -> 2574.70s]  It's OK.
[2574.70s -> 2575.58s]  Shoot.
[2575.58s -> 2576.06s]  He's low.
[2581.47s -> 2582.35s]  Oh, he's so low.
[2582.99s -> 2590.29s]  I lived.
[2590.29s -> 2591.41s]  Oh, we just got to get rid of him.
[2592.29s -> 2592.85s]  Please die.
[2595.20s -> 2597.76s]  Oh, oh, see you later.
[2597.76s -> 2598.24s]  Let's go.
[2598.24s -> 2598.96s]  Use that momentum.
[2599.60s -> 2609.74s]  I'm gaming so hard right now.
[2611.68s -> 2612.00s]  All right.
[2612.00s -> 2612.40s]  It's fine.
[2617.86s -> 2618.26s]  Shit.
[2618.26s -> 2618.98s]  We're getting juggled.
[2627.52s -> 2628.08s]  We're good.
[2628.08s -> 2628.32s]  OK.
[2629.26s -> 2630.30s]  No, shit.
[2630.30s -> 2630.94s]  OK.
[2630.94s -> 2631.26s]  We're good.
[2631.26s -> 2631.58s]  We're good.
[2633.78s -> 2634.10s]  All right.
[2637.49s -> 2638.05s]  Oh, my God.
[2638.21s -> 2639.09s]  Slick is such a nerd.
[2640.45s -> 2640.69s]  All right.
[2640.69s -> 2641.81s]  I'm going Iron Giant this time.
[2641.81s -> 2642.29s]  All right.
[2642.29s -> 2643.01s]  All right.
[2643.01s -> 2643.97s]  My Iron Giant's better.
[2643.97s -> 2644.29s]  All right.
[2645.09s -> 2645.74s]  I got juggled.
[2645.74s -> 2646.54s]  We're going to match their comp.
[2646.54s -> 2647.42s]  We're going to match their comp.
[2649.78s -> 2650.50s]  I'm going LeBron.
[2651.30s -> 2652.05s]  OK.
[2652.61s -> 2653.41s]  You're confident, LeBron.
[2655.49s -> 2662.67s]  Everyone's saying, oh, no.
[2666.24s -> 2667.84s]  We have to win so we can do this.
[2667.84s -> 2668.88s]  We're going to be fine.
[2668.88s -> 2669.76s]  Everything's going to be OK.
[2673.57s -> 2675.01s]  Yeah, we got Iron Giant too.
[2676.00s -> 2676.96s]  Loser picks stage.
[2676.96s -> 2677.92s]  I don't care what stage we get.
[2677.92s -> 2678.32s]  We'll win.
[2678.72s -> 2679.52s]  What was that laugh?
[2679.52s -> 2683.36s]  That was like a little goblin laugh.
[2683.36s -> 2684.00s]  All right, we got it.
[2684.00s -> 2684.40s]  We got it.
[2684.40s -> 2684.96s]  Pull it back.
[2685.44s -> 2690.10s]  I think these perks are OK.
[2690.90s -> 2692.91s]  Wolf ball speed, projectile speed.
[2696.35s -> 2698.66s]  Yeah, I think those are pretty good.
[2698.66s -> 2699.70s]  If you want to match the.
[2699.70s -> 2700.18s]  All right.
[2700.18s -> 2701.14s]  Yeah, it's all shit.
[2701.14s -> 2701.70s]  All right.
[2701.70s -> 2702.26s]  You're good.
[2702.26s -> 2702.74s]  All right.
[2702.74s -> 2706.14s]  I'm going as hard as I can for this one.
[2706.14s -> 2707.10s]  We win this one.
[2707.10s -> 2708.70s]  We don't lose to Iron Giant twice.
[2708.70s -> 2712.05s]  No, I got the cooler skin too.
[2712.05s -> 2713.92s]  This is going to be a 40 minute stream.
[2713.92s -> 2714.56s]  No, it's not.
[2714.56s -> 2715.12s]  Just wait.
[2715.12s -> 2717.49s]  We're going to pull it back right here.
[2717.49s -> 2718.13s]  I've had shorter.
[2718.13s -> 2720.32s]  I've had shorter.
[2720.32s -> 2720.56s]  All right.
[2720.56s -> 2720.80s]  You're good.
[2720.80s -> 2721.52s]  Good to go.
[2721.52s -> 2722.59s]  Yep.
[2722.59s -> 2740.72s]  Keep that juggle up.
[2741.36s -> 2742.16s]  Make him go off the screen.
[2742.16s -> 2742.96s]  Oh, he's so low.
[2758.46s -> 2763.73s]  There he goes.
[2764.29s -> 2766.99s]  He's right here.
[2772.18s -> 2772.58s]  All right.
[2773.14s -> 2777.52s]  Is there bugs even taking much damage?
[2777.52s -> 2778.08s]  I can't even tell.
[2779.12s -> 2780.56s]  I don't think their bugs have taken any damage.
[2780.56s -> 2781.36s]  He said he was bad.
[2782.00s -> 2782.80s]  I can't believe it.
[2795.60s -> 2796.48s]  So many iron giants.
[2797.12s -> 2797.52s]  We're good.
[2800.50s -> 2801.38s]  Oh, my God.
[2811.60s -> 2812.32s]  Oh, keep it up.
[2813.92s -> 2814.88s]  I can't jump that high.
[2814.88s -> 2815.92s]  Give me a kill, man.
[2816.72s -> 2820.32s]  There he goes.
[2820.32s -> 2820.56s]  All right.
[2821.12s -> 2821.60s]  There we go.
[2822.24s -> 2822.72s]  There's bugs.
[2822.72s -> 2824.48s]  We got to get rid of this fucking bug.
[2830.24s -> 2830.80s]  There he goes.
[2830.80s -> 2830.96s]  All right.
[2830.96s -> 2831.20s]  All right.
[2831.20s -> 2832.32s]  We got to bully somebody.
[2832.32s -> 2832.88s]  Bully somebody.
[2837.14s -> 2837.70s]  I can't believe it.
[2837.70s -> 2840.50s]  Oh, shit.
[2840.50s -> 2840.82s]  All right.
[2841.46s -> 2842.66s]  God, I hate this.
[2842.66s -> 2843.70s]  This is so sad.
[2843.70s -> 2843.94s]  It's all right.
[2843.94s -> 2844.42s]  It's all right.
[2844.42s -> 2844.66s]  We're good.
[2844.66s -> 2844.82s]  We're good.
[2845.94s -> 2846.90s]  Wait, wait.
[2846.90s -> 2848.02s]  Is it best of three?
[2848.02s -> 2849.14s]  I think it's the best of three.
[2849.14s -> 2850.90s]  You guys are down in losers bracket.
[2850.90s -> 2851.62s]  But no worries.
[2851.62s -> 2852.82s]  Still a lot more gameplay played.
[2854.80s -> 2856.37s]  Can we ban iron giant?
[2857.44s -> 2858.88s]  No.
[2858.88s -> 2859.28s]  All right.
[2862.42s -> 2864.96s]  Well, all right.
[2864.96s -> 2866.72s]  We just need to figure out a solution to our problem.
[2866.72s -> 2867.92s]  I don't fucking care if we lost.
[2867.92s -> 2877.41s]  I'm doing the joke.
[2877.41s -> 2883.20s]  Well, if you catch me playing Rhindog, I did.
[2883.20s -> 2886.08s]  That's how you know I've lost it.
[2886.08s -> 2887.92s]  These things are going to get to be like room champ.
[2887.92s -> 2888.40s]  I don't want to.
[2888.40s -> 2892.61s]  I want to like a nice ice cold carrot.
[2892.61s -> 2894.61s]  Even if you're eating a cold carrot.
[2895.17s -> 2896.86s]  All right.
[2896.86s -> 2898.06s]  We're going to bring it back.
[2898.06s -> 2899.98s]  We're going to fucking do it.
[2899.98s -> 2902.21s]  Are you doing like a bugs bunny joke?
[2902.21s -> 2908.75s]  Oh, we're going to dominate the next one.
[2911.68s -> 2913.60s]  We should challenge them double or nothing.
[2913.60s -> 2919.18s]  I'm going to play.
[2919.74s -> 2920.46s]  I couldn't do it.
[2920.46s -> 2921.18s]  I couldn't.
[2921.18s -> 2923.07s]  I couldn't see.
[2923.07s -> 2924.35s]  Yeah, I couldn't tell what was going on.
[2924.35s -> 2926.75s]  Too many iron giants.
[2926.75s -> 2928.67s]  Yeah, maybe should have just stuck Tom and Jerry.
[2928.67s -> 2930.67s]  But it was a good play.
[2930.67s -> 2932.35s]  I thought I had the better iron giant.
[2932.35s -> 2933.31s]  I still think I did.
[2933.31s -> 2937.23s]  I just, you know, there's a there's a lot of input lag.
[2937.23s -> 2940.03s]  Look, and I live like 15 minutes away from each other.
[2940.03s -> 2944.19s]  It's like, you know, if we were closer, maybe it'd be better.
[2944.19s -> 2944.51s]  Yeah.
[2944.51s -> 2946.18s]  I mean, well, there's a thing.
[2946.18s -> 2948.26s]  Yeah, they're.
[2948.26s -> 2949.86s]  Yeah, they had they had pink advantage.
[2954.58s -> 2955.38s]  Amen.
[2955.38s -> 2956.99s]  That was a good game, man.
[2956.99s -> 2959.55s]  Are we going to keep is there more than like this best of three
[2959.55s -> 2960.75s]  or is that the only best of three?
[2960.75s -> 2962.75s]  I mean, we can double or nothing if you want.
[2962.75s -> 2964.69s]  I don't really see a point in that.
[2966.29s -> 2968.29s]  They already just won like unanimously.
[2968.29s -> 2970.10s]  I don't know why they would do that.
[2970.10s -> 2972.58s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2972.58s -> 2974.10s]  Were we supposed to lose the second one?
[2974.10s -> 2975.46s]  I didn't even get the script.
[2975.46s -> 2976.26s]  Yeah, you were.
[2976.26s -> 2977.86s]  Well, that would have been ideal.
[2977.86s -> 2978.90s]  But it's OK.
[2978.90s -> 2982.22s]  Like we German had like a joke.
[2982.22s -> 2983.26s]  No, it's OK.
[2983.26s -> 2984.06s]  No, it's all good.
[2984.06s -> 2985.92s]  It worked out.
[2985.92s -> 2986.16s]  Yeah.
[2986.16s -> 2987.52s]  Did you guys get the joke off?
[2987.52s -> 2988.24s]  Oh, yeah.
[2988.24s -> 2990.02s]  No, it worked out good.
[2990.02s -> 2991.09s]  Yeah.
[2991.09s -> 2992.21s]  Yeah, definitely.
[2992.21s -> 2992.93s]  Yeah.
[2992.93s -> 2993.17s]  Yeah.
[2993.17s -> 2994.93s]  I mean, yeah, I recommend.
[2994.93s -> 2996.21s]  Yeah, probably play Iron Giant.
[2996.21s -> 2997.09s]  So, yeah.
[2997.09s -> 3001.65s]  Next time you guys got to send me the joke before we didn't give you the script.
[3001.65s -> 3003.09s]  Oh, that's on me.
[3003.09s -> 3003.89s]  I apologize.
[3005.17s -> 3007.25s]  I was in charge of that and I made a mistake.
[3007.25s -> 3008.05s]  I made an error.
[3008.05s -> 3009.81s]  OK.
[3009.81s -> 3011.89s]  Anyways, I hope you guys win big.
[3011.89s -> 3013.65s]  You guys are you guys did really good.
[3013.65s -> 3015.41s]  And you know, you earned it.
[3015.41s -> 3016.21s]  You know, you guys played good.
[3016.21s -> 3017.09s]  You earned it.
[3017.09s -> 3018.53s]  You had really good bugs as well.
[3018.53s -> 3020.51s]  GGs, guys.
[3020.51s -> 3021.79s]  GGs, guys.
[3021.79s -> 3022.19s]  Good game.
[3022.19s -> 3022.99s]  Seriously.
[3022.99s -> 3024.19s]  Good games.
[3024.19s -> 3025.07s]  Good luck in the journey.
[3025.07s -> 3032.40s]  We should have done what's up, Doc.
[3032.40s -> 3033.44s]  We should have what's up, Doc.
[3033.44s -> 3034.40s]  I'm right at the end.
[3034.40s -> 3037.15s]  Just do it again.
[3037.15s -> 3040.43s]  Well, these have to last the whole stream.
[3042.13s -> 3044.10s]  I only have French fries.
[3044.10s -> 3047.15s]  Is there a character that like really likes French fries?
[3047.15s -> 3049.78s]  Is there a character that's a French fry character?
[3049.78s -> 3050.42s]  I don't know.
[3050.42s -> 3051.54s]  I don't know.
[3054.80s -> 3055.92s]  I'm trying to think if there's a.
[3055.92s -> 3056.56s]  Oh, yeah.
[3056.56s -> 3057.12s]  French fries.
[3059.98s -> 3061.34s]  Popeye has spinach.
[3061.34s -> 3062.30s]  Bugs has carrots.
[3064.02s -> 3065.78s]  Rhyndog loves French fries.
[3066.26s -> 3067.30s]  Daffy has cocaine.
[3068.45s -> 3069.17s]  What else?
[3069.17s -> 3071.74s]  What are the other like staples?
[3071.74s -> 3073.58s]  Apparently, Rhyndog loves French fries.
[3073.58s -> 3074.53s]  Really?
[3074.53s -> 3075.09s]  Yeah.
[3075.09s -> 3076.05s]  That's what they're all saying.
[3076.05s -> 3077.49s]  They're all big Rhyndog fans.
[3077.49s -> 3080.54s]  Steven Universe likes fries?
[3080.54s -> 3082.86s]  I am playing Steven Universe.
[3082.86s -> 3085.25s]  Wait, you're not playing Steven Universe?
[3085.25s -> 3085.75s]  I refuse.
[3087.98s -> 3088.62s]  Why?
[3088.62s -> 3089.47s]  I don't know.
[3089.47s -> 3092.51s]  There was a kid in my high school that really liked Steven Universe.
[3092.77s -> 3093.81s]  And they were annoying to me.
[3093.81s -> 3095.41s]  So it just ever since I was like,
[3095.41s -> 3098.21s]  I just didn't ever want to think about Steven Universe.
[3098.21s -> 3099.17s]  I haven't even unlocked them.
[3099.17s -> 3101.17s]  I have like 30 character tokens
[3101.17s -> 3103.49s]  and that character is still just locked on my screen.
[3103.49s -> 3104.29s]  So you get it then.
[3104.29s -> 3104.77s]  Okay.
[3104.77s -> 3106.59s]  So Connor gets it.
[3106.59s -> 3107.71s]  Everyone thought I was crazy when I said this.
[3107.71s -> 3107.87s]  Okay.
[3107.87s -> 3109.95s]  When you play a game like multiverses
[3109.95s -> 3111.23s]  or like Smash Brothers, whatever,
[3111.23s -> 3113.39s]  that is a bunch of characters from different universes,
[3113.39s -> 3115.30s]  different games, different TV shows.
[3115.30s -> 3119.31s]  If you get your ass kicked by like a bunch of try-hards
[3119.31s -> 3120.99s]  on a single character, right?
[3121.55s -> 3124.11s]  Doesn't it make you hate the fucking show?
[3124.11s -> 3126.16s]  Oh, a thousand percent.
[3126.16s -> 3126.64s]  Right?
[3126.64s -> 3128.08s]  The thing is I just hated it prior.
[3128.08s -> 3129.76s]  But yeah, you're right about it though.
[3129.76s -> 3131.28s]  If they start pissing me off,
[3131.28s -> 3133.44s]  there's no chance I'm ever playing a Fire Emblem game in my life.
[3134.16s -> 3135.76s]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[3135.76s -> 3137.68s]  I went up against a bunch of Fins and Jakes
[3137.68s -> 3140.74s]  that I got just dominated by probably dozens of times.
[3140.74s -> 3145.12s]  And it genuinely makes me not want to watch Adventure Time ever again.
[3145.12s -> 3146.40s]  Yeah, I don't blame you.
[3146.40s -> 3147.76s]  It's starting to piss me off.
[3147.76s -> 3149.44s]  I don't even like Finn as a character anymore.
[3149.44s -> 3153.25s]  I just think about him like spinning his backpack around
[3153.25s -> 3154.85s]  and I'm like, yeah, it's not entertaining.
[3154.85s -> 3157.22s]  You guys talking about me again?
[3157.22s -> 3158.93s]  Yeah.
[3158.93s -> 3160.82s]  Oh, you ready to boot up?
[3160.82s -> 3162.58s]  You guys are going up against Lily and Michael.
[3162.58s -> 3163.54s]  All right, let's do it.
[3163.54s -> 3164.99s]  Such a big fan.
[3164.99s -> 3167.41s]  Did they add us?
[3167.41s -> 3168.05s]  How does that work?
[3168.05s -> 3168.69s]  We're going to need to add.
[3169.73s -> 3173.55s]  Pop it in the wall if they're not doing it off rip.
[3173.55s -> 3175.39s]  Everyone's thing is in general too as well.
[3175.39s -> 3176.51s]  Yeah, I'll add them right now.
[3176.51s -> 3179.52s]  Lovely.
[3179.52s -> 3180.56s]  Cool, cool, cool.
[3180.56s -> 3183.49s]  How are you Ludwig?
[3183.49s -> 3186.45s]  He deafened.
[3186.45s -> 3189.14s]  All right, let me add some adding here.
[3195.73s -> 3197.41s]  Let me make sure I get this right.
[3197.41s -> 3203.44s]  I probably should tell because this is a random fucking weirdo
[3204.08s -> 3205.28s]  Scarlet Otter is adding you.
[3205.28s -> 3205.76s]  That's not me.
[3205.76s -> 3206.32s]  You know what I mean?
[3206.32s -> 3207.60s]  I should probably tell them.
[3207.60s -> 3211.68s]  Fake Scarlet Otters everywhere.
[3211.68s -> 3216.10s]  The guy who took my name felt bad about it.
[3216.10s -> 3218.82s]  And then like, so I added Connor Eats Pants on here
[3218.82s -> 3221.06s]  and then they changed their name to like,
[3221.06s -> 3223.38s]  I don't know how to fix.
[3223.38s -> 3226.34s]  And then I tried to change it back to Connor Eats Pants
[3226.34s -> 3228.26s]  and then the name is still like gone.
[3228.26s -> 3230.34s]  It's just like removed from the pool of names now.
[3230.34s -> 3231.86s]  Dude, do you see what I just wrote in the general?
[3233.23s -> 3234.59s]  I don't even know my own user.
[3234.59s -> 3236.67s]  I'm Scarlet Otter and some numbers.
[3237.23s -> 3238.83s]  I genuinely don't know what it is.
[3238.83s -> 3239.47s]  It's on the screen.
[3239.47s -> 3240.67s]  It's 505.
[3240.67s -> 3241.68s]  Is it?
[3241.68s -> 3243.28s]  Yeah, it's right below.
[3243.28s -> 3243.76s]  Yeah.
[3243.76s -> 3249.66s]  Jerma just posted lewd photos in the general chat.
[3249.66s -> 3251.07s]  I can't believe it.
[3251.07s -> 3253.31s]  All right, let me get Michael.
[3253.31s -> 3256.83s]  Oh, that was Lily that added me.
[3256.83s -> 3259.55s]  I was like, wow, that person's got the $100 edition of the game
[3259.55s -> 3260.59s]  and they tried to add me.
[3260.59s -> 3262.98s]  I should have known considering their name was Lily.
[3262.98s -> 3265.68s]  How many L's?
[3266.48s -> 3272.66s]  I hope I got that right.
[3272.66s -> 3275.46s]  That was like, yeah, Michael's name.
[3275.46s -> 3278.16s]  There you go.
[3278.16s -> 3281.92s]  All right, profile pics.
[3281.92s -> 3284.00s]  I can't believe we're getting some e-daters, dude.
[3284.00s -> 3285.04s]  All right, here we go.
[3285.20s -> 3289.73s]  Good.
[3289.73s -> 3290.61s]  All right, no hazards.
[3290.61s -> 3291.73s]  Seven minutes, four ring outs.
[3291.73s -> 3292.85s]  All right, all the maps are good.
[3292.85s -> 3295.17s]  All right, so I'm going bugs again.
[3295.17s -> 3297.07s]  Dude, just use your main.
[3297.07s -> 3298.03s]  Yep, I'm ready.
[3300.50s -> 3302.10s]  I can't believe the matching profile pics.
[3302.10s -> 3303.30s]  We got to one up that.
[3304.10s -> 3304.90s]  Do you want to do?
[3304.90s -> 3306.22s]  I don't know.
[3306.22s -> 3306.54s]  What do you have?
[3306.54s -> 3309.10s]  Do you have the LeBron profile picture?
[3309.10s -> 3309.82s]  The basketball?
[3311.36s -> 3312.37s]  No.
[3312.37s -> 3312.87s]  No.
[3316.13s -> 3316.69s]  I have the...
[3316.69s -> 3318.05s]  Just copy theirs.
[3318.05s -> 3318.69s]  Just copy?
[3319.57s -> 3321.49s]  Put on the Steven Universe star.
[3321.49s -> 3324.54s]  Oh, wait, it doesn't change.
[3324.54s -> 3325.98s]  No, it doesn't change it.
[3325.98s -> 3327.74s]  Oh, I thought you didn't like Steven Universe, though.
[3327.74s -> 3328.22s]  I thought you didn't like it.
[3328.22s -> 3329.50s]  I just wanted to like scare them.
[3329.50s -> 3331.10s]  I just wanted to like match their profile pics.
[3331.10s -> 3333.50s]  Then we could like maybe get in their head a little bit.
[3333.50s -> 3341.26s]  Why is my voice pitched up?
[3341.26s -> 3343.70s]  It is.
[3343.70s -> 3346.02s]  I think they mean like when I talk.
[3346.02s -> 3347.92s]  Oh, no, it is now, though.
[3347.92s -> 3350.74s]  Oh, it is, right?
[3350.74s -> 3352.74s]  Yeah, you're like you're more than pitched up.
[3352.74s -> 3356.53s]  You're like like a bit of robot pitched up.
[3356.53s -> 3359.31s]  Dude, yeah, I got to go XLR.
[3359.31s -> 3361.18s]  It's fucking cool.
[3361.18s -> 3361.98s]  Yeah, wait, hold on.
[3361.98s -> 3363.79s]  I got this.
[3363.79s -> 3366.91s]  I don't know.
[3367.95s -> 3368.75s]  There we go.
[3368.75s -> 3370.56s]  Do you just keep this on?
[3373.60s -> 3375.62s]  Should we keep it on?
[3378.70s -> 3379.02s]  Let's go.
[3379.02s -> 3379.58s]  Let's go for it.
[3383.34s -> 3385.26s]  Dude, funny voices stream.
[3385.26s -> 3387.02s]  Yes, people love that.
[3387.02s -> 3395.79s]  I'm glad you understand like the rhythm of like, oh, we're stuck on the waiting screen
[3395.79s -> 3397.15s]  and I don't know what to do for the stream.
[3397.15s -> 3400.54s]  I'm just going to start pressing buttons on the go XLR.
[3400.54s -> 3401.90s]  Yeah, that's kind of how it goes.
[3401.90s -> 3404.58s]  These carrots are just good, by the way.
[3404.58s -> 3406.77s]  I got to start having carrots on command.
[3406.77s -> 3407.81s]  That's a good idea.
[3407.81s -> 3411.82s]  Are you eating carrots and playing Bugs Bunny?
[3411.82s -> 3413.18s]  That was a joke and we lost.
[3415.30s -> 3418.34s]  I got these big ass just like Omega carrots and it was going to be like,
[3418.34s -> 3419.86s]  oh, we're going to win Bugs and it's going to be funny.
[3419.86s -> 3420.74s]  It's not funny.
[3420.74s -> 3423.78s]  Give like a Bugs catchphrase you can do on command.
[3426.58s -> 3427.22s]  Yeah, I'll give it to you.
[3427.22s -> 3427.70s]  Ready?
[3427.70s -> 3429.33s]  You give it to me.
[3431.36s -> 3432.48s]  What's up, Jack?
[3432.48s -> 3434.50s]  That was pretty good.
[3434.50s -> 3436.18s]  That was phenomenal, Jerma.
[3436.18s -> 3436.82s]  Pretty good one.
[3438.16s -> 3439.92s]  That was genuinely great.
[3439.92s -> 3443.39s]  Oh, thank you.
[3443.39s -> 3444.67s]  Are you guys waiting to start?
[3444.67s -> 3445.39s]  Peter Griffin.
[3448.96s -> 3449.44s]  Yeah, we're ready.
[3449.44s -> 3450.32s]  We're ready to go.
[3450.32s -> 3453.76s]  Yeah, you're Bugs Bunny and I'm like Peter Griffin trying to do a Bugs Bunny.
[3453.84s -> 3461.65s]  That's going to be in my head now.
[3461.65s -> 3462.37s]  You guys fucked me up.
[3462.37s -> 3462.93s]  We're going to lose.
[3464.18s -> 3467.17s]  They should add Peter.
[3467.17s -> 3468.29s]  Yeah, they should.
[3468.29s -> 3471.04s]  What does it sound like with the filter on?
[3474.66s -> 3475.46s]  What's up, Jack?
[3479.54s -> 3480.50s]  Are we supposed to play?
[3485.14s -> 3485.86s]  What's up, bro?
[3485.86s -> 3488.83s]  We should go.
[3488.83s -> 3489.79s]  It just sounds like you're going like,
[3491.39s -> 3494.43s]  like you just ate the fucking like hot fucking Cheetos.
[3494.43s -> 3498.06s]  Should we go?
[3498.06s -> 3498.94s]  Are we ready?
[3498.94s -> 3499.50s]  I don't know.
[3499.50s -> 3500.14s]  Is that?
[3500.14s -> 3500.80s]  I don't know.
[3500.80s -> 3503.82s]  Did he say blood wig?
[3504.86s -> 3505.90s]  Did he say go?
[3505.90s -> 3508.13s]  I think he said go.
[3508.13s -> 3509.81s]  I think, I think we go.
[3509.81s -> 3513.55s]  Are we going to go?
[3513.55s -> 3514.11s]  Go.
[3514.11s -> 3514.51s]  Go?
[3514.51s -> 3518.51s]  Well, I see like the other streams look like they're playing.
[3518.51s -> 3523.09s]  All right, let's go.
[3523.09s -> 3524.37s]  You guys, you guys can start.
[3524.37s -> 3525.49s]  Oh, yeah, we did.
[3526.29s -> 3527.65s]  Okay, okay, just getting some lag.
[3527.65s -> 3531.71s]  The game is just lagging a little bit.
[3531.71s -> 3538.13s]  There's a lot of scarlet otters online.
[3538.13s -> 3539.97s]  It's kind of messing with the netcode.
[3539.97s -> 3543.25s]  Oh shit, they're in universe.
[3543.25s -> 3544.53s]  They get 10% damage buff.
[3544.53s -> 3546.11s]  Is that real?
[3546.67s -> 3547.55s]  Yeah.
[3547.55s -> 3552.32s]  So if we don't get the Scooby Doo stage, then they're going to be triple buffed.
[3552.32s -> 3558.29s]  All right, let's just, let's just make it happen.
[3558.29s -> 3558.61s]  Let's go.
[3558.61s -> 3561.97s]  You ready to have a sip of green tea?
[3561.97s -> 3562.53s]  Yep.
[3562.53s -> 3571.73s]  We're not going to be on the stage too, right?
[3571.73s -> 3572.29s]  Uh oh.
[3572.29s -> 3573.17s]  Are we on their stage?
[3573.17s -> 3574.85s]  Oh God, that's a net, that's 20% damage.
[3577.34s -> 3578.86s]  This might be rigged is what I'm thinking.
[3578.86s -> 3582.94s]  I don't know if Ludwig can hear us, but I've heard that there's a conspiracy against us.
[3582.94s -> 3590.24s]  Sometimes I heard people were saying that mentioning that they killed Jerry.
[3617.12s -> 3617.62s]  Whoa.
[3620.40s -> 3631.46s]  There it is.
[3631.46s -> 3641.15s]  I got her solo.
[3641.79s -> 3642.53s]  There it goes.
[3646.75s -> 3647.25s]  Whoa.
[3647.95s -> 3648.45s]  We're good.
[3655.60s -> 3656.00s]  Oh my God.
[3656.00s -> 3657.12s]  We're better, Jerma.
[3657.12s -> 3657.84s]  Just keep it up.
[3657.84s -> 3658.24s]  Don't say that.
[3658.24s -> 3658.74s]  We don't know.
[3659.36s -> 3660.32s]  It'll be a massive comeback.
[3660.32s -> 3660.82s]  You don't know.
[3661.44s -> 3669.81s]  Oh, that kills.
[3669.81s -> 3671.33s]  Oh, they have the profile pick buff too.
[3675.52s -> 3676.02s]  Oh my God.
[3676.02s -> 3676.32s]  We're good.
[3676.32s -> 3676.82s]  We're good.
[3680.62s -> 3717.74s]  Get that knockout.
[3720.98s -> 3722.58s]  Oh my God, he's so slippery.
[3723.14s -> 3732.34s]  So slippery.
[3732.34s -> 3732.82s]  All right, we got it.
[3732.82s -> 3733.32s]  Good, good, good.
[3734.82s -> 3736.26s]  That was an accident, but it worked.
[3738.51s -> 3739.39s]  Oh my goodness.
[3739.39s -> 3741.23s]  We almost just got double taken out.
[3741.23s -> 3742.27s]  That was almost so bad.
[3743.23s -> 3746.86s]  Oh, one hit, one hit, one hit.
[3746.86s -> 3749.59s]  Just die.
[3754.75s -> 3757.39s]  Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.
[3757.39s -> 3758.03s]  He's dead.
[3758.03s -> 3758.51s]  Okay, we're good.
[3758.51s -> 3759.23s]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[3759.23s -> 3759.73s]  Yes.
[3761.23s -> 3762.11s]  We got one.
[3762.11s -> 3763.39s]  What's up, Doc?
[3763.39s -> 3764.11s]  What's up, Doc?
[3764.11s -> 3765.39s]  I just bit my tongue in half.
[3770.21s -> 3770.61s]  We're good.
[3770.61s -> 3771.41s]  We're good.
[3771.41s -> 3771.89s]  We're good.
[3771.89s -> 3772.29s]  We're good.
[3772.29s -> 3772.77s]  We're good.
[3772.77s -> 3773.41s]  I'm so happy.
[3774.69s -> 3776.27s]  We did it.
[3776.27s -> 3776.99s]  We got one.
[3779.25s -> 3780.37s]  I screamed so loud.
[3782.50s -> 3783.54s]  That was a really good match.
[3784.18s -> 3787.54s]  They could have taken that any second.
[3788.50s -> 3789.78s]  We played with heart, though.
[3789.78s -> 3791.62s]  They could have taken that at any second.
[3791.62s -> 3797.54s]  All right, we're going to stick with what we have,
[3797.54s -> 3799.38s]  or we're going to go change it up.
[3799.38s -> 3802.90s]  I think we stick with it.
[3802.90s -> 3804.26s]  If it works, it works, right?
[3804.26s -> 3806.42s]  We've only been beaten by an iron giant.
[3808.24s -> 3809.52s]  All right, okay.
[3809.52s -> 3814.45s]  I feel like my Bugs is off today.
[3814.45s -> 3815.57s]  Maybe I'll go Superman.
[3815.57s -> 3817.17s]  I feel off today, too.
[3817.17s -> 3818.13s]  Something's in the air.
[3818.13s -> 3827.34s]  Yeah, I'm sleeping on my Superman.
[3827.34s -> 3829.18s]  My Superman's actually probably better than my Bugs.
[3829.18s -> 3830.46s]  My Bugs aren't that great.
[3831.98s -> 3834.77s]  Maybe time to bring up Superman next time.
[3834.77s -> 3838.46s]  Do you have a good Superman line?
[3838.46s -> 3843.68s]  Yeah, believe everything to me.
[3846.48s -> 3846.80s]  Yeah.
[3846.80s -> 3848.32s]  And then he goes down, and he farts.
[3849.84s -> 3852.88s]  The only super media I've seen is the Zack Snyder movie,
[3852.88s -> 3854.24s]  so he doesn't really do that.
[3854.24s -> 3856.00s]  He's more upset.
[3856.88s -> 3880.35s]  Here we go.
[3891.44s -> 3892.00s]  Just be careful.
[3892.00s -> 3892.40s]  Be careful.
[3893.04s -> 3905.01s]  Let's go.
[3905.01s -> 3905.65s]  Wait a minute.
[3905.65s -> 3906.13s]  There he is.
[3908.40s -> 3909.44s]  It's a beta keratin, I think.
[3910.64s -> 3911.36s]  That was deficient.
[3912.16s -> 3913.60s]  Improved your eyesight.
[3913.60s -> 3915.04s]  That's how the carrots work.
[3915.04s -> 3916.40s]  I mean, it's been like 20 minutes
[3916.40s -> 3917.92s]  since I took the first bite, right?
[3917.92s -> 3918.16s]  Yep.
[3918.88s -> 3929.98s]  Oh, my God.
[3929.98s -> 3930.62s]  Good game, good game.
[3930.62s -> 3931.50s]  You went off that game.
[3932.86s -> 3935.76s]  Something was in you.
[3936.32s -> 3937.44s]  Might have been the carrots.
[3937.44s -> 3939.04s]  You were an animal that round.
[3939.04s -> 3940.64s]  The beta keratin finally kicked in.
[3942.32s -> 3944.08s]  Do you have a mouthful of carrots?
[3944.08s -> 3945.42s]  Yep.
[3945.42s -> 3946.30s]  I love that.
[3946.30s -> 3947.42s]  Congratulations, you two.
[3947.42s -> 3948.70s]  Great edge guard on the left side.
[3948.70s -> 3949.18s]  Great win.
[3949.82s -> 3950.78s]  And you're moving on.
[3950.78s -> 3956.70s]  Yeah, good game, good game.
[3956.70s -> 3958.54s]  I just kind of popped off.
[3958.62s -> 3959.90s]  Like, that's all, is it?
[3959.90s -> 3961.55s]  I don't know what happened, man.
[3962.19s -> 3963.39s]  Something got in you.
[3963.39s -> 3966.66s]  They almost took that first game, though.
[3966.66s -> 3967.30s]  That was good.
[3967.30s -> 3970.03s]  That was a good match.
[3970.03s -> 3970.35s]  All right.
[3970.35s -> 3972.35s]  So the biggest losers bracket run of all time
[3972.35s -> 3974.99s]  is what people are saying is about to happen.
[3974.99s -> 3978.50s]  Essentially the best losers run
[3978.50s -> 3979.78s]  in multiverses history.
[3979.78s -> 3980.42s]  What the fuck?
[3980.42s -> 3981.70s]  I just look like an idiot.
[3981.70s -> 3982.29s]  What?
[3982.29s -> 3982.93s]  What's wrong?
[3982.93s -> 3985.01s]  Look at the lobby.
[3986.10s -> 3988.02s]  It looks like I did that and you didn't.
[3988.02s -> 3991.26s]  And you were convincing me not to do that.
[3991.26s -> 3993.58s]  Wait, you're still the skull for me.
[3993.58s -> 3995.10s]  I'm not on my screen.
[3995.10s -> 3996.48s]  Oh, that's embarrassing.
[3996.48s -> 3997.04s]  Oh, God.
[3997.04s -> 3998.48s]  No, but that's not supposed to be like that.
[3998.48s -> 3999.68s]  That was something we did before.
[3999.68s -> 4000.64s]  That's all right.
[4000.64s -> 4002.69s]  Oh, come on.
[4002.69s -> 4004.86s]  I feel like, wow, I can't believe this.
[4004.86s -> 4006.30s]  That was just Scarlett Otter guy
[4006.30s -> 4008.06s]  just changed his profile picture to ours.
[4008.06s -> 4009.42s]  That was your fucking idea.
[4012.82s -> 4015.14s]  I'm on the star now, too, for what it's worth.
[4015.14s -> 4017.04s]  That's not what I...
[4017.60s -> 4018.64s]  We were doing the thing at the...
[4018.64s -> 4019.76s]  Why did it change now?
[4019.76s -> 4020.56s]  Oh, my God.
[4021.12s -> 4022.32s]  I hope they understand that.
[4022.32s -> 4023.36s]  Please, I hope they understand that.
[4024.72s -> 4026.08s]  I'm not trying to be like Dick.
[4026.08s -> 4034.93s]  That looks so bad.
[4034.93s -> 4038.00s]  These french fries are pretty good.
[4038.00s -> 4041.15s]  Dude, do you have any carrots?
[4041.15s -> 4041.87s]  No.
[4041.87s -> 4042.51s]  Really?
[4042.51s -> 4044.29s]  No, I don't have any carrots.
[4044.29s -> 4045.89s]  I'm telling you, that's what changed.
[4045.89s -> 4048.24s]  I think I do need some.
[4048.24s -> 4049.46s]  Oh, wait, there it goes.
[4049.46s -> 4050.10s]  It changed back.
[4050.10s -> 4053.07s]  Oh, now I have the star.
[4053.07s -> 4057.95s]  Stop making enemies.
[4059.39s -> 4060.35s]  They're awesome people.
[4060.35s -> 4067.92s]  What are you talking about?
[4067.92s -> 4069.92s]  Did you ever tell them
[4069.92s -> 4071.44s]  the story of you meeting Mr. Beast?
[4072.18s -> 4072.74s]  No.
[4072.74s -> 4074.34s]  Because I told it...
[4075.70s -> 4077.70s]  I told from my perspective that story.
[4077.70s -> 4078.58s]  It was really funny.
[4080.29s -> 4080.85s]  You can tell it.
[4081.01s -> 4081.65s]  I'm sorry.
[4081.65s -> 4082.15s]  Yeah.
[4084.21s -> 4088.58s]  So I took Jerma to the Ninja Mr. Beast event,
[4089.30s -> 4090.74s]  the League of Legends event.
[4090.74s -> 4094.42s]  And we go backstage to Mr. Beast's team room.
[4094.42s -> 4096.26s]  And it's just a few people in there.
[4096.26s -> 4097.06s]  And I was like, okay.
[4097.94s -> 4099.46s]  Jerma, you can say hi to Mr. Beast.
[4099.46s -> 4101.94s]  Now, Mr. Beast was very much like hyper focused
[4101.94s -> 4103.06s]  on like league mode.
[4103.06s -> 4104.82s]  He was only focused on that,
[4104.82s -> 4105.86s]  looking at his iPad or whatever,
[4105.86s -> 4106.98s]  looking over game plans.
[4106.98s -> 4108.11s]  And they were sitting on the couch
[4108.11s -> 4108.91s]  and Jerma goes like,
[4109.78s -> 4111.14s]  I think you said something like,
[4111.14s -> 4112.02s]  hey, I'm Jerma.
[4112.66s -> 4113.62s]  He didn't say anything.
[4115.46s -> 4116.90s]  Like, he was just there.
[4116.90s -> 4117.86s]  And I was like, oh, no.
[4117.86s -> 4119.62s]  And I was like, hey, Jimmy, Jimmy.
[4119.62s -> 4120.42s]  This is Jerma.
[4120.42s -> 4121.46s]  He's a YouTuber.
[4121.46s -> 4122.34s]  And he was like, oh, okay.
[4122.34s -> 4123.94s]  Hey, nice to meet you.
[4123.94s -> 4125.76s]  And I was like, okay.
[4125.76s -> 4127.12s]  Well, kind of saved.
[4127.12s -> 4128.48s]  And then I'm like, no, no, no, don't worry.
[4128.48s -> 4130.56s]  He definitely watched your TF2 videos.
[4131.84s -> 4132.88s]  He's a busy guy, right?
[4132.88s -> 4134.24s]  He's a busy guy.
[4134.24s -> 4136.54s]  He's a busy guy.
[4136.54s -> 4139.58s]  But he knew who you were after.
[4139.58s -> 4141.42s]  Well, even if he doesn't, that's fine.
[4141.42s -> 4142.94s]  You expect everybody to know who you are.
[4142.94s -> 4145.44s]  It was kind of funny, though.
[4146.14s -> 4146.94s]  Yeah, it was probably funny.
[4148.42s -> 4154.96s]  He's the sus guy.
[4154.96s -> 4156.48s]  Tell me the sus guy.
[4156.48s -> 4159.09s]  Yeah, he's the sus guy, right?
[4159.09s -> 4159.49s]  Yeah.
[4159.49s -> 4163.89s]  But, okay, let me ask you something.
[4163.89s -> 4164.21s]  Yep.
[4164.21s -> 4167.33s]  Would MrBeast know me more as the sus guy
[4167.33s -> 4171.33s]  or as the guy that used to make TF2 videos like 12 years ago?
[4171.33s -> 4173.49s]  I think, honestly, TF2 videos,
[4173.49s -> 4175.49s]  he's a very old school YouTube guy.
[4175.49s -> 4176.13s]  He is, right?
[4176.13s -> 4179.86s]  Isn't he?
[4179.86s -> 4180.98s]  Maybe sus guy, too, though.
[4180.98s -> 4185.79s]  That might ring a few bells.
[4185.79s -> 4186.75s]  How'd it even happen?
[4186.75s -> 4188.35s]  I just remember randomly at some point,
[4188.35s -> 4190.35s]  it was like sus was now associated with you.
[4191.20s -> 4192.48s]  Just like appeared.
[4192.48s -> 4195.41s]  Somebody made a meme, which was like,
[4195.41s -> 4196.85s]  oh, look, when the imposter is sus,
[4196.85s -> 4198.85s]  and I put it on my screen for five seconds.
[4198.85s -> 4200.46s]  That'll do it.
[4200.46s -> 4204.90s]  Wasn't there the guy that like burned that image into his TV?
[4204.90s -> 4205.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[4207.89s -> 4208.93s]  That guy was full of shit, though.
[4213.44s -> 4215.79s]  It's 10 years, not 12.
[4215.79s -> 4218.27s]  Well, it's 2022, going into 2023.
[4218.27s -> 4219.23s]  It'll be 11.
[4219.23s -> 4219.79s]  Sorry.
[4219.79s -> 4226.32s]  I've been making videos since 2007.
[4226.32s -> 4231.10s]  I made a, I would recall.
[4231.10s -> 4232.67s]  How old were you?
[4232.67s -> 4234.11s]  I was eight years old.
[4234.75s -> 4235.65s]  What?
[4235.97s -> 4239.25s]  I got a camcorder, my mom's camcorder,
[4239.25s -> 4240.85s]  and I would use the macro function
[4240.85s -> 4243.57s]  to zoom in from far away to the focus work
[4243.57s -> 4246.93s]  on my Nintendo DS Pokemon Diamond Wi-Fi battles.
[4246.93s -> 4247.43s]  Wow.
[4248.29s -> 4252.22s]  That's unbelievable.
[4252.22s -> 4253.18s]  Eight years old.
[4256.56s -> 4257.20s]  And I was bad.
[4257.20s -> 4258.08s]  I was very bad at the game,
[4258.08s -> 4260.80s]  and I didn't understand how the tiers worked.
[4260.80s -> 4262.56s]  I'm like, why couldn't you use certain Pokemon?
[4262.56s -> 4263.92s]  Because they were too good.
[4263.92s -> 4265.44s]  And so I would join battles,
[4265.44s -> 4267.12s]  and they'd be like, you can't use this guy.
[4267.12s -> 4269.68s]  And I would just be like, no, I'm using this Jirachi.
[4269.68s -> 4270.48s]  I want to use it.
[4271.20s -> 4273.52s]  And it was just like a completely cheated Pokemon, too.
[4273.52s -> 4274.96s]  But I enjoyed it.
[4274.96s -> 4277.14s]  Remember, you were like 60 when he was eight.
[4279.55s -> 4281.71s]  Someone said, so that's why you were like this.
[4281.71s -> 4282.91s]  Yeah, no, that is why.
[4282.91s -> 4284.37s]  That's what happened.
[4284.37s -> 4289.33s]  As a kid, I was pissed they didn't let me use Charizard.
[4289.33s -> 4290.29s]  Okay, well, you're just wrong,
[4290.29s -> 4291.73s]  because Charizard's not even that good.
[4291.73s -> 4294.53s]  So he's never been banned.
[4294.53s -> 4300.59s]  I made that up, acting like I don't know the tiers of Pokemon.
[4300.59s -> 4301.31s]  Come on, now.
[4301.31s -> 4304.82s]  What's your favorite Pokemon?
[4304.82s -> 4306.85s]  Favorite Pokemon?
[4306.85s -> 4307.81s]  Probably Wooper.
[4309.57s -> 4310.61s]  Who's Wooper?
[4310.61s -> 4311.65s]  You don't know Wooper?
[4312.45s -> 4315.52s]  All I know, I know like 10 Pokemon.
[4315.52s -> 4316.96s]  Okay, I know all of them.
[4317.95s -> 4318.35s]  Oh, you do?
[4318.35s -> 4320.83s]  Name all 150 original Pokemon right now.
[4320.83s -> 4326.00s]  I honestly, there's a 20% chance you name a number of the first 150,
[4326.00s -> 4327.60s]  and I might be able to tell you which one it is.
[4327.60s -> 4329.18s]  Okay.
[4329.18s -> 4330.85s]  Um.
[4330.85s -> 4336.40s]  Eight.
[4336.40s -> 4336.96s]  Vermilion.
[4338.14s -> 4340.91s]  I got to get like a thing to see.
[4340.91s -> 4344.75s]  Original 150 Pokemon.
[4344.75s -> 4348.06s]  And they had their numbered?
[4348.06s -> 4350.18s]  Is it?
[4350.18s -> 4351.06s]  Okay, let's see.
[4351.06s -> 4354.43s]  That was a softball one, was it?
[4354.43s -> 4355.23s]  Okay, hold on, let me see.
[4355.23s -> 4356.67s]  Let me get the list here.
[4356.67s -> 4358.11s]  Bit of a softball.
[4358.11s -> 4360.43s]  Was it a softball?
[4360.43s -> 4362.99s]  Yeah, because the first nine are all starters, right?
[4362.99s -> 4364.67s]  And so I just remembered it started Bulbasaur,
[4364.67s -> 4367.73s]  then it was Squirtle, and then it was Charmander.
[4367.73s -> 4369.82s]  So then number eight would be Charmeleon.
[4369.82s -> 4370.30s]  What?
[4370.30s -> 4370.86s]  How do you know that?
[4370.86s -> 4372.78s]  Okay, so hold on, let me get, I got one here.
[4372.78s -> 4375.95s]  All right, I'll give you, let's get you a tough one.
[4375.95s -> 4376.83s]  Oh, it's Wartortle?
[4376.83s -> 4377.55s]  Oh, nevermind.
[4377.55s -> 4378.19s]  I messed up then.
[4378.19s -> 4379.46s]  Oh, you messed up?
[4379.46s -> 4379.70s]  Yeah.
[4379.70s -> 4385.79s]  All right, how about number 30?
[4385.79s -> 4395.95s]  Um, I think, I think Raichu's 26.
[4395.95s -> 4396.83s]  God damn, I have the wrong,
[4396.83s -> 4400.51s]  this is original 150 Pokemon according to my boyfriend.
[4401.57s -> 4403.57s]  It's like they're all just fake names.
[4403.57s -> 4403.89s]  Hold on.
[4403.89s -> 4406.05s]  Oh, well, let me take,
[4406.05s -> 4409.65s]  give me a hint as to what that one's boyfriend name is.
[4409.65s -> 4410.69s]  They're blue?
[4410.69s -> 4414.54s]  Oh, Nidorino, Nidorina, one of them.
[4414.54s -> 4418.29s]  Um, one of them, the one before it is,
[4419.01s -> 4421.78s]  they call it Water Mouse.
[4421.78s -> 4423.22s]  It's a blue mouse and it's like,
[4423.22s -> 4424.98s]  Oh yeah, Nidorina.
[4424.98s -> 4431.49s]  Okay, but the one after that is the one that's apparently 30.
[4431.49s -> 4439.06s]  Uh, wait, Nidoran is one of them.
[4439.06s -> 4440.19s]  Okay.
[4440.19s -> 4441.79s]  Oh wait, here's a, here's a list.
[4441.79s -> 4443.62s]  Here's an actual list, okay.
[4443.62s -> 4447.95s]  How about, um, 39?
[4447.95s -> 4449.63s]  39, um.
[4449.63s -> 4450.43s]  Do you want me to give you a hint?
[4450.43s -> 4457.36s]  Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.
[4457.36s -> 4458.88s]  That's so much more than a hint.
[4458.88s -> 4460.64s]  That's, it's Jigglypuff.
[4460.64s -> 4461.28s]  Oh, okay, good.
[4461.28s -> 4461.76s]  You got it.
[4461.76s -> 4463.60s]  All right, what's the name of the Pokemon?
[4463.60s -> 4466.64s]  What's 41?
[4466.64s -> 4467.92s]  You said Jigglypuff was what?
[4467.92s -> 4472.54s]  39.
[4472.54s -> 4473.82s]  Trousy?
[4473.82s -> 4476.77s]  Sorry, it's Zubat.
[4476.77s -> 4477.25s]  Yeah.
[4477.25s -> 4478.94s]  Okay, how about, let's-
[4478.94s -> 4481.84s]  I could at least name every Pokemon up to like,
[4481.84s -> 4485.65s]  if I saw Silhouette, I could name, I think almost every Pokemon.
[4485.65s -> 4486.29s]  That's so cool.
[4486.29s -> 4488.99s]  All right, what about, who's 149?
[4488.99s -> 4489.71s]  Not 150.
[4489.71s -> 4491.15s]  We know, we all know who that is.
[4491.15s -> 4493.71s]  149 is, uh, Dragonair.
[4493.71s -> 4496.02s]  Damn, okay, what about 148?
[4496.02s -> 4496.82s]  Dragonair.
[4496.82s -> 4498.02s]  All right, what about 147?
[4498.02s -> 4498.91s]  Keep it up.
[4498.91s -> 4499.55s]  Dratini.
[4499.55s -> 4502.06s]  Damn, okay, 146.
[4502.06s -> 4503.66s]  Articuno or Moltres?
[4503.66s -> 4504.70s]  Moltres, you got it.
[4504.70s -> 4506.69s]  145.
[4506.69s -> 4507.65s]  Uh, Articuno.
[4508.69s -> 4509.57s]  Very close.
[4509.57s -> 4511.89s]  Yep, 144 is Articuno.
[4511.89s -> 4514.21s]  It's Articuno, and then before that would be-
[4514.85s -> 4515.41s]  143.
[4517.17s -> 4518.21s]  Joltia?
[4518.21s -> 4519.49s]  Mm-mm, mm-mm.
[4519.49s -> 4522.37s]  Is it one of those Eevees?
[4522.37s -> 4523.73s]  Nope, I'll give you a hint.
[4523.73s -> 4528.05s]  Very sleepy.
[4528.05s -> 4528.69s]  Very sleepy.
[4528.69s -> 4530.13s]  Oh, Snorlax, Snorlax.
[4530.13s -> 4531.41s]  You got it.
[4531.41s -> 4531.81s]  That's it.
[4531.81s -> 4533.33s]  Drowsy, I'm like, he's not that far up.
[4533.33s -> 4534.93s]  Well, you got a lot in a row.
[4534.93s -> 4536.53s]  That was impressive.
[4536.53s -> 4538.29s]  No, yeah, you're like, this is really cool,
[4538.29s -> 4540.37s]  but no, it was bad because like, in school,
[4540.37s -> 4543.17s]  all of my knowledge was just reserved for Pokemon information,
[4543.17s -> 4545.09s]  and I did really bad because like,
[4545.09s -> 4547.62s]  my brain just wouldn't care about like,
[4547.62s -> 4549.06s]  knowledge I needed to know for tests.
[4549.06s -> 4550.98s]  It was only reserved for Pokemon.
[4550.98s -> 4556.51s]  Yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, you had an interest.
[4556.51s -> 4557.39s]  Yeah, that's true.
[4557.39s -> 4557.87s]  Can you imagine-
[4557.87s -> 4558.59s]  It ended up working out.
[4558.59s -> 4560.99s]  Okay, but can you imagine if instead of just like,
[4560.99s -> 4564.75s]  random stupid dumb math problems, they made it so like,
[4564.75s -> 4567.55s]  oh, like Sally has five carrots,
[4568.51s -> 4570.03s]  Jason has 15 carrots.
[4570.03s -> 4571.15s]  Don't you think if they just made it,
[4571.15s -> 4573.07s]  like Squirtle has 15 carrots,
[4573.07s -> 4575.63s]  and Charizard has seven carrots that you would care more.
[4575.63s -> 4577.39s]  You'd be like, oh, six, Charizard's got carrots.
[4577.39s -> 4580.08s]  Charizard's gonna care more.
[4580.08s -> 4581.12s]  Why don't they do that?
[4581.12s -> 4582.35s]  I don't know.
[4582.35s -> 4585.01s]  When I was in kindergarten, I went to a like,
[4585.01s -> 4587.65s]  church school, and then they banned Pokemon like,
[4587.65s -> 4588.85s]  right when I got there.
[4588.85s -> 4590.69s]  They were like, you can't talk about Pokemon.
[4590.69s -> 4591.89s]  And then my mom complained.
[4591.89s -> 4593.17s]  It was like, my son likes this.
[4593.17s -> 4594.93s]  He's gonna talk about it.
[4594.93s -> 4595.33s]  Sorry.
[4595.33s -> 4597.41s]  And then I was allowed to talk about Pokemon
[4597.41s -> 4598.61s]  during recess only.
[4601.50s -> 4604.80s]  Only during recess though, not during school time.
[4604.80s -> 4606.32s]  Not every kid likes Pokemon though.
[4606.32s -> 4608.80s]  Yeah, but couldn't you pull the class on like,
[4608.80s -> 4610.32s]  on a ranked system?
[4610.32s -> 4611.52s]  Okay, you got like, the Looney Tunes.
[4611.52s -> 4614.18s]  You got like, Rugrats, Ren and Stimpy,
[4615.30s -> 4616.78s]  Steven Universe, whatever.
[4616.78s -> 4618.94s]  Just have them rank how much they like it,
[4618.94s -> 4620.30s]  and then base the whole curriculum.
[4620.30s -> 4622.54s]  Just replace all the dumb boring, like a train
[4622.54s -> 4625.98s]  leaves Boston going, you know, 200 miles per hour,
[4625.98s -> 4629.34s]  and you know, 10 miles to go visit New Jersey, right?
[4629.34s -> 4630.70s]  Just make it like Steven Universe,
[4630.70s -> 4633.82s]  just traveling 200 miles per hour to go visit Charizard.
[4633.82s -> 4634.30s]  Not my son.
[4634.30s -> 4636.30s]  My son is not gonna be learning from Steven Universe.
[4636.30s -> 4637.26s]  Not on my watch.
[4637.26s -> 4640.29s]  He'll be, it'll be Bugs Bunny.
[4640.29s -> 4642.46s]  It'll be Tom and Jerry.
[4642.46s -> 4645.87s]  It'll be Ren and Stimpy.
[4645.87s -> 4650.80s]  It'll be not that, anything but that.
[4651.60s -> 4653.60s]  So they're moving way too fast.
[4655.38s -> 4659.78s]  When is our next game, sir?
[4659.78s -> 4661.78s]  How does, are we just like ignoring people?
[4661.78s -> 4662.34s]  What's the deal?
[4662.34s -> 4664.42s]  I think we just been, we were seated so high
[4664.42s -> 4666.10s]  that we're waiting for our next game.
[4666.10s -> 4666.90s]  Oh, that makes sense.
[4666.90s -> 4670.16s]  It's like a bracket.
[4671.06s -> 4672.50s]  My physics teacher used to make tests
[4672.50s -> 4674.18s]  with Dragon Ball characters.
[4674.18s -> 4680.18s]  Yeah, and did you get an A+, because you loved that anime?
[4680.18s -> 4682.66s]  I did not care for anime at all as a kid.
[4682.66s -> 4685.54s]  My friends really liked Dragon Ball a ton.
[4685.54s -> 4688.02s]  Like, they would always like, they pretend
[4688.02s -> 4691.04s]  and like, be Dragon Ball characters.
[4691.04s -> 4693.86s]  And so I watched the show and I didn't care about like,
[4693.86s -> 4696.58s]  the super like, Saiyan characters.
[4696.58s -> 4698.02s]  So I found out there was a turtle.
[4698.02s -> 4700.10s]  Like, there's a character that just owns a turtle.
[4700.10s -> 4702.78s]  Like, it's like an old man that has a pet turtle.
[4702.78s -> 4705.42s]  And so I would play pretend by just curling up
[4705.42s -> 4708.30s]  in a ball on the ground and then being the turtle.
[4708.30s -> 4713.26s]  And that was how I had fun in that.
[4713.26s -> 4716.53s]  How long was your like, recess?
[4716.53s -> 4717.73s]  Like, 20 minutes.
[4717.73s -> 4718.53s]  20 minutes?
[4718.53s -> 4726.42s]  This wasn't recess though.
[4726.42s -> 4728.10s]  This was like, I wouldn't do that at school.
[4728.10s -> 4729.06s]  Kids would have made fun of me.
[4729.06s -> 4733.54s]  This was around close friends.
[4733.54s -> 4734.50s]  Oh, okay, that hurt.
[4734.98s -> 4735.70s]  Hold on.
[4735.70s -> 4737.63s]  I'm just imagining you at recess.
[4737.63s -> 4738.11s]  No, no, no.
[4738.11s -> 4740.03s]  That would have been bad if kids were like,
[4740.03s -> 4741.87s]  why is he being a turtle at recess?
[4741.87s -> 4742.19s]  No, no, no.
[4742.19s -> 4742.75s]  That would have been bad.
[4743.47s -> 4745.71s]  That would be like, I mean, who didn't do, wait,
[4745.71s -> 4748.19s]  you didn't do the let's pretend to be animals at recess?
[4748.19s -> 4748.51s]  Yeah.
[4748.51s -> 4750.22s]  Well, maybe.
[4750.22s -> 4751.98s]  I think, yeah, I definitely did that, I think.
[4751.98s -> 4753.66s]  Yeah, that wouldn't be out of the ordinary.
[4753.66s -> 4754.06s]  No, no.
[4754.06s -> 4755.98s]  When my close friends like, hang out at their house,
[4755.98s -> 4757.90s]  like our parents are hanging out, right?
[4757.90s -> 4760.22s]  Like, so we're just upstairs playing pretend
[4760.22s -> 4761.78s]  and they play Dragon Ball.
[4761.78s -> 4762.98s]  I'm like, okay, I'll be the turtle.
[4764.67s -> 4765.63s]  Because I didn't care.
[4766.61s -> 4771.58s]  That's awesome.
[4771.58s -> 4774.30s]  Wait, people in chat are saying, you know,
[4774.30s -> 4775.34s]  the things they usually say.
[4776.45s -> 4779.25s]  So wait, there was not one point when you were younger
[4779.25s -> 4782.93s]  at recess where you went around going like this
[4782.93s -> 4787.38s]  with your arm, going like, why can't,
[4787.38s -> 4790.42s]  you know, are they like an elephant?
[4790.42s -> 4793.58s]  Like, you didn't run around like an elephant
[4793.58s -> 4794.70s]  or like a horse or something?
[4794.70s -> 4795.50s]  Like, what are you talking about?
[4795.50s -> 4795.98s]  Yes, you did.
[4797.71s -> 4800.11s]  I don't know if I, yeah, I mean, I recall like
[4800.11s -> 4801.63s]  doing the arm thing, I guess, to be an elephant,
[4801.63s -> 4803.79s]  but I don't know if I like chose to be the elephant.
[4803.79s -> 4805.55s]  That was never like one I went for.
[4807.30s -> 4809.46s]  Like, I'm a bear, like, rawr.
[4809.46s -> 4810.58s]  I didn't mane elephant.
[4810.58s -> 4813.54s]  I was more of like a cheetah guy or maybe a lion.
[4813.54s -> 4814.04s]  Yeah.
[4820.16s -> 4821.60s]  That's not furry behavior.
[4821.60s -> 4825.18s]  That's just your, like, seven.
[4825.18s -> 4828.06s]  Yeah, I want to know which furry is like an elephant.
[4828.06s -> 4829.18s]  I've never heard of that before.
[4831.94s -> 4833.06s]  Yeah, that definitely exists.
[4837.07s -> 4840.42s]  My mane.
[4840.42s -> 4844.37s]  I didn't mane elephant that I did.
[4844.37s -> 4850.54s]  Guys, I'm not streaming with a furry.
[4850.54s -> 4851.34s]  It's okay, guys.
[4852.06s -> 4852.56s]  Okay.
[4857.15s -> 4865.06s]  It's pretending to be Sonic Count.
[4865.06s -> 4866.88s]  I think so.
[4866.88s -> 4869.26s]  I love to be Sonic.
[4869.26s -> 4873.02s]  Yeah, but so what, so wait, how come, so when it's a cool animal,
[4873.02s -> 4875.42s]  that's okay, but when it's an elephant, I'm the weird kid.
[4875.42s -> 4876.22s]  What are you talking about?
[4876.22s -> 4878.14s]  You're pretending to be a hedgehog running fast.
[4878.14s -> 4882.11s]  Sonic's like super fast, though, and elephants are really slow.
[4882.11s -> 4882.75s]  So?
[4882.75s -> 4886.83s]  That makes Sonic cooler, though.
[4886.83s -> 4888.27s]  He's like the fastest thing ever.
[4889.84s -> 4891.04s]  But it's still a hedgehog.
[4891.04s -> 4894.22s]  It's like a different, though.
[4894.22s -> 4897.42s]  Like, if you saw like a real hedgehog next to Sonic,
[4897.42s -> 4903.25s]  you'd be like, yeah, those are two different things.
[4903.25s -> 4905.92s]  Yeah, that's true.
[4905.92s -> 4907.92s]  Even Sonic doesn't pretend to be a hedgehog.
[4907.92s -> 4911.84s]  Yeah, I don't even know if he is, honestly.
[4911.84s -> 4915.47s]  He might just be insane and thinks that he is.
[4915.47s -> 4917.07s]  We pretended to be Dragon Ball characters.
[4917.07s -> 4918.58s]  Step up your game.
[4918.58s -> 4921.78s]  Yeah, but there's all kinds of fun media to pretend to be.
[4921.78s -> 4927.28s]  When are they going to add John Oliver to the game?
[4927.28s -> 4928.64s]  He is Warner Bros now.
[4928.64s -> 4930.16s]  That'd be cool.
[4930.16s -> 4930.72s]  I don't want to do it.
[4930.72s -> 4931.60s]  Don't make me do it.
[4931.60s -> 4934.64s]  No, don't make me do it.
[4934.64s -> 4935.68s]  Don't make me do John Oliver.
[4935.68s -> 4936.40s]  Don't make me do it.
[4936.40s -> 4939.09s]  Was that the reason that guy came here for the first time to ask me
[4939.09s -> 4942.05s]  that was to try to bait me into reading it so that you would do the John Oliver?
[4942.05s -> 4946.16s]  I'm not going to do it.
[4946.16s -> 4947.36s]  No, I can't.
[4947.36s -> 4948.08s]  No.
[4951.28s -> 4954.54s]  About John Oliver doing a what's up doc.
[4954.54s -> 4956.30s]  All right, gamers.
[4956.30s -> 4957.58s]  I thought that was it.
[4957.58s -> 4958.46s]  I was like, wait a minute.
[4961.12s -> 4961.52s]  Your time.
[4961.52s -> 4961.92s]  It's your time.
[4961.92s -> 4962.72s]  You want to go?
[4962.72s -> 4963.04s]  Let's go.
[4963.04s -> 4963.44s]  Let's go.
[4963.44s -> 4965.34s]  Who are we going against?
[4965.34s -> 4966.86s]  Stan's in Alpha Red.
[4966.86s -> 4967.18s]  All right.
[4967.18s -> 4968.77s]  OK.
[4968.77s -> 4969.17s]  All right.
[4969.17s -> 4970.69s]  So go ahead and set that one up.
[4970.69s -> 4972.37s]  You can start that up whenever it's ready.
[4972.37s -> 4972.93s]  Cool.
[4972.93s -> 4974.77s]  OK.
[4974.77s -> 4976.26s]  I will add them.
[4976.26s -> 4980.02s]  These guys are pretty good at gaming.
[4980.02s -> 4980.34s]  They are?
[4980.34s -> 4981.46s]  Well, so are we.
[4981.46s -> 4982.26s]  We'll be fine.
[4982.26s -> 4985.70s]  We're better at gaming sometimes.
[4985.70s -> 4986.74s]  Hey, so are we.
[4986.74s -> 4992.72s]  This could be our day.
[4992.72s -> 4994.48s]  I'm not playing Rhyndog, guys.
[4994.48s -> 4995.52s]  I'm not doing that.
[4995.52s -> 4999.33s]  Unless I lose.
[4999.33s -> 5001.49s]  If I lose the first round, I'll play Rhyndog.
[5001.49s -> 5005.30s]  Yeah, we'll switch it up before you lose.
[5005.30s -> 5006.02s]  Oh, OK.
[5006.98s -> 5012.70s]  What is Alpha?
[5013.98s -> 5015.20s]  There we go.
[5015.20s -> 5015.68s]  OK.
[5015.68s -> 5021.47s]  Rhyndog be like, mmm, french fry.
[5021.47s -> 5022.67s]  Yeah, he does be like that.
[5022.67s -> 5023.63s]  That's what he does.
[5023.63s -> 5031.79s]  All right.
[5031.79s -> 5033.23s]  I've sent them both invites.
[5033.23s -> 5047.55s]  Change profile pics.
[5047.55s -> 5049.23s]  You don't get caught using the Steven Universe one.
[5049.23s -> 5050.43s]  Thank you for reminding me.
[5050.43s -> 5052.16s]  Oh, oh, shit.
[5052.16s -> 5061.78s]  They're in a game.
[5061.78s -> 5063.46s]  Oh, they're in a game.
[5064.29s -> 5067.90s]  See, we just talked about, like, playing Pokemon.
[5067.90s -> 5068.70s]  We didn't practice.
[5069.79s -> 5071.87s]  We could have been practicing this whole time.
[5071.87s -> 5072.75s]  We could have.
[5072.75s -> 5075.84s]  Wow, it's been like 20 minutes, too, hasn't it?
[5075.84s -> 5076.48s]  Yep.
[5076.48s -> 5077.12s]  Well, whatever.
[5077.92s -> 5080.70s]  I think we're OK.
[5080.70s -> 5082.54s]  Did you at least, like, eat more carrots?
[5082.54s -> 5083.76s]  I'm on it.
[5083.76s -> 5090.45s]  Carrots are wearing off?
[5090.45s -> 5090.69s]  Nope.
[5090.69s -> 5104.02s]  I'm going to make sure there's a stream of carrots.
[5104.02s -> 5105.54s]  Wait, Connor, is your birthday?
[5105.54s -> 5106.98s]  Is it actually your birthday?
[5106.98s -> 5107.70s]  No, it's not.
[5107.70s -> 5111.01s]  My birthday is, like, not this Friday.
[5111.01s -> 5114.11s]  Two weeks from Friday.
[5114.11s -> 5114.91s]  Well, happy birthday.
[5114.91s -> 5115.71s]  Happy early birthday.
[5115.71s -> 5116.11s]  Thanks.
[5116.11s -> 5120.14s]  It's my birthday.
[5120.14s -> 5120.78s]  Here we go.
[5120.78s -> 5121.34s]  All right.
[5121.34s -> 5125.87s]  All right, let's do a repeat of last time.
[5125.87s -> 5129.57s]  Oh, this guy's got a cool profile picture.
[5129.57s -> 5130.37s]  OK.
[5130.37s -> 5137.38s]  Oh, he's the loony king.
[5137.38s -> 5141.22s]  Jerma, do you have that one?
[5141.22s -> 5142.26s]  What's the loony king?
[5142.26s -> 5144.85s]  It's the profile picture Alpharet has.
[5144.85s -> 5149.47s]  I think he gets that from being, like, really good at Bugs Bunny, I think.
[5149.47s -> 5152.08s]  What?
[5152.08s -> 5154.56s]  Reached mastery level 14 on Bugs Bunny.
[5154.56s -> 5156.16s]  What?
[5156.16s -> 5157.60s]  Are you not mastery level?
[5157.60s -> 5158.08s]  No.
[5158.08s -> 5159.28s]  Oh, no.
[5159.28s -> 5162.16s]  I always get to, like, right before mastery and change character.
[5162.16s -> 5164.91s]  Because I don't want anyone.
[5164.91s -> 5167.01s]  I don't need that to be good.
[5167.01s -> 5167.65s]  Right.
[5167.65s -> 5169.98s]  So we can go whenever, right?
[5170.30s -> 5173.10s]  I get really, like, self-conscious about, like, if people can tell that, like, I've
[5173.10s -> 5176.62s]  played the game a good bit in an online game so that I can always have the excuse of, like,
[5176.62s -> 5180.13s]  oh, well, like, I don't even play that much.
[5180.13s -> 5181.73s]  Like, get a life, go outside.
[5181.73s -> 5183.09s]  And then, like, I leave the game.
[5183.09s -> 5184.29s]  That's what I do in, like, Valorant.
[5186.69s -> 5187.81s]  Like, Overwatch.
[5187.81s -> 5190.21s]  Let me just make sure.
[5190.21s -> 5191.41s]  Should I go right when we're ready?
[5191.41s -> 5195.65s]  Or are we waiting for the go ahead?
[5195.65s -> 5197.57s]  I'm assuming we can start.
[5197.57s -> 5199.17s]  But I could be wrong.
[5199.17s -> 5203.39s]  Change character?
[5203.39s -> 5206.58s]  You could try Superman if you want.
[5206.58s -> 5207.94s]  I could try Superman.
[5207.94s -> 5209.71s]  That's a good call.
[5209.71s -> 5212.02s]  I'm going to go Superman.
[5212.02s -> 5212.74s]  Change it up.
[5212.74s -> 5215.84s]  Here comes the heat.
[5215.84s -> 5222.34s]  I don't think I even have perks on Superman, though.
[5222.34s -> 5222.74s]  Oh, well.
[5222.74s -> 5228.26s]  As long as I'm standing.
[5228.26s -> 5230.53s]  Oh, shit.
[5230.53s -> 5232.70s]  Hold on.
[5232.70s -> 5236.11s]  Uh-oh.
[5236.11s -> 5236.83s]  No way!
[5236.83s -> 5237.07s]  Hey!
[5237.07s -> 5237.63s]  It's all right.
[5237.63s -> 5238.11s]  It's all right.
[5238.11s -> 5239.55s]  You get time here to do it.
[5239.55s -> 5244.48s]  Cool down duration?
[5244.48s -> 5246.00s]  What are you playing as?
[5246.00s -> 5246.96s]  Commentary.
[5246.96s -> 5247.44s]  Yeah, yeah.
[5247.44s -> 5248.56s]  You can do cool down if you want.
[5248.56s -> 5249.12s]  Cool down.
[5249.76s -> 5257.04s]  5% melee damage.
[5257.04s -> 5258.00s]  Oh, hell no.
[5260.06s -> 5261.58s]  How you guys feeling going into this?
[5261.58s -> 5262.14s]  I feel pretty good.
[5262.14s -> 5265.04s]  Level 18 Velma.
[5265.04s -> 5267.84s]  I mean, I don't have a perk, which is, you know, should be illegal.
[5267.84s -> 5268.96s]  Oh, they're matching perks, too.
[5269.76s -> 5271.25s]  I would never do that.
[5271.25s -> 5271.97s]  Hey, watch this.
[5271.97s -> 5272.77s]  We're good.
[5272.77s -> 5280.14s]  Stacking perks is like a sign that, like, you're afraid, I think.
[5281.58s -> 5282.61s]  Here we go.
[5282.61s -> 5282.93s]  You ready?
[5282.93s -> 5283.49s]  Let's go.
[5283.49s -> 5283.73s]  Yep.
[5283.73s -> 5285.81s]  I got beta keratin flowing through my bloodstream.
[5285.81s -> 5315.57s]  I'm getting gaming stints.
[5315.57s -> 5316.07s]  Shit.
[5325.57s -> 5326.07s]  Oh, my God.
[5326.69s -> 5330.69s]  The top of my control stick fell off.
[5330.69s -> 5331.41s]  Oh, man.
[5331.41s -> 5331.91s]  OK.
[5332.29s -> 5332.93s]  Sorry.
[5332.93s -> 5337.49s]  Literally, Jerma, like, the top of the Xbox controller thumbstick fell off.
[5337.49s -> 5338.37s]  You got a controller problem?
[5339.01s -> 5340.69s]  It fell off of the controller.
[5342.10s -> 5342.98s]  There's no stick.
[5343.86s -> 5363.79s]  We got to get rid of this fucking Superman.
[5364.43s -> 5364.83s]  I know.
[5364.83s -> 5365.33s]  I'm trying.
[5365.87s -> 5369.43s]  There you go.
[5372.08s -> 5375.25s]  One more time.
[5375.25s -> 5375.75s]  What?
[5376.13s -> 5378.42s]  Oh, you're being arrested.
[5379.30s -> 5381.22s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[5390.27s -> 5390.75s]  Good.
[5390.75s -> 5391.15s]  Sorry.
[5391.15s -> 5391.63s]  All together.
[5392.35s -> 5393.82s]  Speed up on the Superman.
[5393.82s -> 5395.90s]  They're going to be hitting gamer fatigue really soon here.
[5395.90s -> 5396.40s]  Yep.
[5396.78s -> 5397.66s]  They're too confident.
[5401.66s -> 5402.46s]  That's not what I meant to do.
[5404.88s -> 5405.60s]  Oh, I had it.
[5406.16s -> 5438.98s]  There it is.
[5438.98s -> 5439.30s]  We're good.
[5439.30s -> 5439.94s]  Good.
[5439.94s -> 5440.50s]  Velma.
[5440.50s -> 5441.00s]  Velma.
[5466.96s -> 5467.46s]  No.
[5468.08s -> 5470.64s]  Spiker.
[5470.64s -> 5471.14s]  Sorry.
[5472.32s -> 5473.60s]  We almost brought it back.
[5473.60s -> 5475.11s]  We almost brought it back.
[5475.11s -> 5475.75s]  Man, listen.
[5475.75s -> 5477.91s]  If we had host, that spike hits.
[5477.91s -> 5478.63s]  Sorry.
[5478.63s -> 5479.27s]  That was a good game.
[5479.27s -> 5479.91s]  Good game.
[5479.91s -> 5480.39s]  Very close.
[5480.39s -> 5480.89s]  Very close.
[5482.47s -> 5482.97s]  Very close.
[5487.19s -> 5488.47s]  Oh, my God.
[5488.47s -> 5488.97s]  A 3D2.
[5490.15s -> 5493.27s]  All right.
[5493.27s -> 5494.07s]  All right.
[5494.07s -> 5494.57s]  I'm going.
[5495.03s -> 5495.51s]  Here's the plan.
[5495.51s -> 5497.08s]  Ready?
[5497.94s -> 5498.74s]  I'm going back to Bugs.
[5499.54s -> 5500.04s]  OK.
[5503.68s -> 5505.36s]  No, I think I stay on Tom and Jerry chat.
[5505.36s -> 5506.56s]  I know you guys want rindog.
[5506.56s -> 5508.64s]  But I don't think I'm going to win with rindog.
[5508.64s -> 5509.92s]  I don't know how to play that guy.
[5509.92s -> 5510.88s]  And I ran out of carrots.
[5511.75s -> 5512.71s]  This is the part you don't eat.
[5514.61s -> 5515.17s]  Oh, no.
[5515.17s -> 5515.99s]  You have to eat it.
[5515.99s -> 5517.03s]  You have to eat it.
[5517.03s -> 5518.63s]  No, it's the part you can't even eat.
[5518.63s -> 5519.13s]  It's the part.
[5519.13s -> 5519.67s]  You have to eat it.
[5519.67s -> 5519.99s]  OK.
[5519.99s -> 5520.63s]  Fine.
[5520.63s -> 5523.88s]  Hold on.
[5525.84s -> 5526.40s]  Wait.
[5526.40s -> 5527.76s]  Let me just do my level up spell.
[5531.09s -> 5531.73s]  What the?
[5531.73s -> 5532.23s]  What?
[5534.79s -> 5535.29s]  Whoa.
[5535.83s -> 5540.36s]  All right.
[5540.36s -> 5541.16s]  Let's go.
[5541.16s -> 5545.72s]  Show them what we got.
[5545.72s -> 5548.10s]  We can pull it back here.
[5548.10s -> 5548.82s]  We're going to win.
[5549.38s -> 5552.63s]  I know you can eat that part.
[5552.63s -> 5557.19s]  I'm kidding.
[5557.19s -> 5558.39s]  Hey, Connor, even if we lose.
[5560.04s -> 5562.12s]  You still want to play multiverse really well?
[5562.12s -> 5562.68s]  Yeah, I'm down.
[5563.32s -> 5566.34s]  We're going to win this one right here.
[5566.34s -> 5616.53s]  You ready to get out of that thing?
[5621.44s -> 5624.18s]  Keep it up.
[5624.18s -> 5624.50s]  Keep it up.
[5624.50s -> 5624.98s]  Keep it up.
[5624.98s -> 5625.62s]  OK.
[5625.62s -> 5626.76s]  Let's try again.
[5627.80s -> 5628.36s]  Tried to bait him.
[5628.36s -> 5628.76s]  We're good.
[5628.76s -> 5629.08s]  We're good.
[5629.08s -> 5629.32s]  We're good.
[5629.32s -> 5641.04s]  We're good.
[5641.04s -> 5641.36s]  Shit.
[5641.36s -> 5642.96s]  I tried to deal with him.
[5642.96s -> 5678.63s]  We need a spike here.
[5687.30s -> 5697.76s]  Ah, fuck that car.
[5698.56s -> 5711.09s]  Here we go.
[5711.09s -> 5711.65s]  I got Velma.
[5711.65s -> 5712.05s]  Let's go.
[5712.05s -> 5712.45s]  Go, go, go, go.
[5713.09s -> 5714.87s]  She's low.
[5714.87s -> 5717.68s]  How did that not hit him?
[5721.89s -> 5722.61s]  He's just baiting us.
[5722.61s -> 5723.01s]  He's baiting us.
[5723.01s -> 5724.21s]  We got hit Velma.
[5724.21s -> 5725.76s]  All right.
[5725.76s -> 5726.32s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[5726.32s -> 5730.26s]  Velma, let's try.
[5730.26s -> 5736.31s]  Oh, help.
[5738.98s -> 5739.22s]  No.
[5750.48s -> 5750.96s]  How do they keep?
[5750.96s -> 5751.36s]  No, no, no.
[5751.36s -> 5751.92s]  We got it.
[5751.92s -> 5752.96s]  Oh, sorry.
[5752.96s -> 5753.28s]  Sorry.
[5754.72s -> 5755.84s]  I don't understand.
[5755.84s -> 5756.32s]  Damn it.
[5756.32s -> 5757.20s]  I missed the spike.
[5757.20s -> 5758.32s]  If I didn't miss the spike, we would have won.
[5759.04s -> 5760.16s]  Oh, fuck.
[5760.96s -> 5762.32s]  I missed the spike.
[5762.32s -> 5763.44s]  I just don't understand.
[5763.44s -> 5764.96s]  Things that usually work weren't working.
[5765.84s -> 5766.88s]  You guys are doing great.
[5766.88s -> 5768.88s]  Honestly, their strat of having Velma in the back,
[5768.88s -> 5770.64s]  Superman in the front was pretty hard to deal with.
[5770.64s -> 5773.96s]  And I think you guys adapted pretty well.
[5773.96s -> 5776.84s]  I'm saying that we're the most honest team in the tournament
[5776.84s -> 5778.28s]  is what people have been saying, actually,
[5778.28s -> 5781.24s]  is that Tom and Jerry and Bugs is potentially the most ethical.
[5783.64s -> 5786.60s]  Ethically and morally, I think you guys are in the lead.
[5787.24s -> 5790.92s]  I have mixed feelings about Batman deciding to kill in this game
[5790.92s -> 5793.73s]  after signing a lifelong vow.
[5793.73s -> 5796.04s]  So yeah, you guys are spot on.
[5796.04s -> 5796.36s]  It's true.
[5797.24s -> 5798.04s]  That was a good match.
[5798.04s -> 5798.84s]  We almost had it.
[5798.84s -> 5802.08s]  Well, you guys are free to go.
[5802.08s -> 5804.58s]  Thanks for your playing.
[5804.58s -> 5804.98s]  Thanks.
[5805.80s -> 5807.24s]  I still have like $100.
[5808.80s -> 5810.56s]  Wait, does fifth place get anything?
[5810.56s -> 5812.39s]  Are we fifth place, fourth place?
[5812.39s -> 5815.44s]  You guys are fifth place, tied for fifth.
[5817.30s -> 5820.58s]  You get nothing at all, but a big high five.
[5820.58s -> 5822.80s]  OK, that's a high five.
[5822.80s -> 5823.60s]  It's fine.
[5823.60s -> 5824.48s]  So not bad.
[5824.48s -> 5825.20s]  Not bad.
[5825.20s -> 5827.33s]  Anyway, enjoy the rest of your streams, gentlemen.
[5827.33s -> 5828.21s]  Yeah, thanks for the invite.
[5830.93s -> 5832.53s]  Every time you've been here, I've been chewing on a carrot.
[5832.53s -> 5833.97s]  I feel like that's rude.
[5833.97s -> 5835.41s]  I think you do it after every game,
[5835.41s -> 5839.40s]  and that's just when I come in.
[5839.40s -> 5842.76s]  Yo, we got to invite you guys.
[5842.76s -> 5847.75s]  We're next up.
[5848.55s -> 5850.55s]  This is Dr. Battle and Sheep for Hire.
[5850.55s -> 5850.95s]  We lost.
[5850.95s -> 5851.59s]  We won.
[5851.59s -> 5852.31s]  Oh, you lost?
[5852.31s -> 5852.63s]  I'm sorry.
[5852.63s -> 5853.99s]  I thought I was going to be one.
[5853.99s -> 5854.79s]  I marked the bracket wrong.
[5855.67s -> 5857.27s]  Oh, he marked the bracket wrong.
[5857.27s -> 5857.75s]  Sorry.
[5857.75s -> 5858.15s]  I thought we were going to play.
[5858.15s -> 5859.67s]  I was just looking at the bracket.
[5859.67s -> 5860.15s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[5860.15s -> 5862.15s]  Yeah, we went off script, actually.
[5862.15s -> 5864.79s]  I didn't mean to do that to you.
[5865.80s -> 5868.60s]  I was rooting for you guys right after us.
[5868.60s -> 5870.20s]  We're Stans haters.
[5870.20s -> 5871.08s]  We hate Stans.
[5872.12s -> 5873.64s]  Wait, I love the Stans show.
[5873.64s -> 5874.76s]  Calm down, all right?
[5874.76s -> 5875.64s]  The Stans show's dead.
[5875.64s -> 5876.60s]  That's why we hate them.
[5876.60s -> 5878.20s]  Task manager was better, they say.
[5878.84s -> 5880.71s]  Where are you guys in the bracket right now?
[5880.71s -> 5881.99s]  We're up against the Stans.
[5881.99s -> 5882.63s]  Oh, all right.
[5882.63s -> 5883.27s]  Okay.
[5883.27s -> 5886.39s]  Yeah, we got our ring game.
[5886.39s -> 5887.51s]  Connor, we tied with you.
[5887.51s -> 5892.24s]  You want to, for honor, do you guys want to, you know, just go onward?
[5892.24s -> 5895.06s]  Do you want to decide for fourth place?
[5895.06s -> 5896.02s]  Yeah, I'm tied with you.
[5896.02s -> 5896.74s]  Yeah, I'm down.
[5896.74s -> 5897.78s]  Yeah, let's decide fourth place.
[5897.78s -> 5899.30s]  Let's do it.
[5899.30s -> 5900.82s]  Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[5900.82s -> 5902.02s]  Connor eats pants, yeah?
[5902.74s -> 5905.16s]  Yeah, no, Connor from Dream SMP.
[5905.16s -> 5906.04s]  Okay, got it.
[5906.04s -> 5908.36s]  I've already sent you a request.
[5908.36s -> 5911.00s]  Wait, you're the, you were on the Dream SMP, weren't you?
[5911.40s -> 5912.68s]  I am on the Dream SMP.
[5912.68s -> 5913.88s]  Oh, R, okay, wow.
[5913.88s -> 5916.02s]  Like, wait, so do you know Schlatt?
[5916.02s -> 5917.14s]  Yes, yes.
[5917.14s -> 5918.98s]  Dude, no way.
[5918.98s -> 5921.62s]  I think you're the four, like, Valor guy, stolen Valor.
[5921.62s -> 5923.06s]  Sorry, Jerma, this happens a lot.
[5923.06s -> 5923.78s]  There's a lot of-
[5923.78s -> 5925.54s]  Oh my God, dude.
[5925.54s -> 5926.66s]  Yes, hey guys.
[5926.66s -> 5928.66s]  My younger sister loves you guys.
[5928.66s -> 5929.62s]  I know, probably.
[5930.74s -> 5932.42s]  I'll invite you to the lobby.
[5932.42s -> 5934.58s]  She was wondering when you're going to start posting
[5934.58s -> 5935.86s]  Minecraft YouTube videos, though?
[5936.74s -> 5939.27s]  Tell her that, tell her Connor eats pants.
[5939.27s -> 5940.95s]  He retired, he's a new guy now.
[5941.83s -> 5944.12s]  They recasted him, he's different now.
[5945.49s -> 5946.77s]  Who's playing him now?
[5946.77s -> 5949.12s]  Jared Leto, I think.
[5949.12s -> 5950.08s]  That's crazy.
[5950.08s -> 5950.96s]  No, hopefully not.
[5950.96s -> 5952.32s]  I didn't approve of that.
[5952.32s -> 5955.48s]  Well, you don't have to, you don't have to approve of them, really.
[5955.48s -> 5956.12s]  Well.
[5956.12s -> 5957.56s]  You don't like Jared Leto?
[5957.56s -> 5960.00s]  No.
[5960.00s -> 5961.84s]  Andy Carrot, someone's really upset that-
[5963.12s -> 5963.92s]  Yeah, that's all I have.
[5963.92s -> 5966.40s]  I'm just like, oh, remember the guy that was at the multiverse tournament,
[5966.40s -> 5969.12s]  that ate carrots, like, that was what was funny?
[5969.12s -> 5972.23s]  Oh, there's like fucking like a hundred thousand people
[5972.23s -> 5973.83s]  probably concurrently watching the stream.
[5973.83s -> 5975.27s]  I'm the funny guy that chews the carrot.
[5975.27s -> 5978.08s]  Yeah, like that's all I have right now.
[5978.08s -> 5979.76s]  It's literally the only thing I have today.
[5979.76s -> 5983.36s]  We'll just run at random.
[5983.36s -> 5983.86s]  Cool.
[5985.36s -> 5986.88s]  This is for all the glory.
[5986.88s -> 5988.08s]  It's for all the fourth place.
[5988.08s -> 5990.47s]  This is to get the one point in Mario Kart.
[5990.47s -> 5995.41s]  I said that I would gift fourth place a sub, each of them a sub to Amaranth.
[5995.41s -> 5996.36s]  Okay.
[5996.36s -> 5996.86s]  Okay.
[5998.68s -> 6000.04s]  I didn't say that.
[6001.40s -> 6002.60s]  You say you're already subbed, Connor?
[6002.60s -> 6005.16s]  Oh, yeah, no, I'm like on a 14 month streak, I think.
[6005.16s -> 6006.90s]  And it's tier three, right?
[6006.90s -> 6008.66s]  No, no, I don't have it like that.
[6008.66s -> 6009.30s]  Ready to go?
[6009.30s -> 6012.34s]  Oh, I'll tell you what, I'll tier three, yeah, then we'll do that.
[6014.40s -> 6015.98s]  Okay.
[6017.12s -> 6017.92s]  Good luck, guys.
[6017.92s -> 6019.40s]  Good luck, guys.
[6019.40s -> 6023.62s]  All right, I think we stayed, we stayed, what we got?
[6023.62s -> 6028.90s]  Oh, they wanted to play Rhyme Dog.
[6028.90s -> 6030.71s]  Yeah, I'm not doing that.
[6030.71s -> 6031.75s]  Maybe next time.
[6031.75s -> 6033.68s]  Are you guys going for fifth?
[6033.68s -> 6038.98s]  No, this is fourth.
[6038.98s -> 6041.38s]  All I want is the one point in fourth place at Mario Kart.
[6041.38s -> 6042.10s]  That's all I care about.
[6042.74s -> 6043.68s]  Cause then-
[6043.68s -> 6044.96s]  Did you eat another carrot?
[6044.96s -> 6045.46s]  Yeah.
[6045.84s -> 6047.22s]  Good.
[6047.22s -> 6048.72s]  Cause then we placed, right?
[6048.72s -> 6051.28s]  If you come in fourth place, you place.
[6052.42s -> 6055.28s]  Well, like do we win something?
[6055.28s -> 6056.56s]  Cause I don't think so.
[6056.56s -> 6057.28s]  No.
[6057.28s -> 6063.24s]  But like we do place fourth, which is like right below like top three.
[6063.24s -> 6064.68s]  Yeah, I'm okay with that.
[6064.68s -> 6067.68s]  Yeah, it's for fifth, not fourth.
[6067.68s -> 6069.88s]  Oh, okay.
[6069.88s -> 6070.84s]  Well, top five.
[6070.84s -> 6077.75s]  These guys don't even have any perks.
[6079.89s -> 6082.98s]  Well, let's get that fourth place.
[6082.98s -> 6085.41s]  Put on your chapstick.
[6085.41s -> 6087.19s]  How did the top come off the controller?
[6087.19s -> 6091.57s]  I have the Xbox Elite controller so you can switch out the thumbsticks.
[6091.57s -> 6095.41s]  And then I was gaming so hard that the left one popped off and it was just a little nub.
[6096.05s -> 6128.21s]  Let's go for it.
[6128.21s -> 6128.45s]  All right.
[6128.45s -> 6129.09s]  Get that.
[6129.09s -> 6130.93s]  Oh, nice attempt.
[6131.73s -> 6134.42s]  They almost had it.
[6135.06s -> 6135.56s]  Yep.
[6136.02s -> 6143.60s]  It cost them their items.
[6144.32s -> 6146.31s]  Where the hell did this come from?
[6146.95s -> 6148.80s]  Oh, that's you, right?
[6148.80s -> 6149.76s]  You can pull out an item.
[6149.76s -> 6150.26s]  Yep.
[6150.72s -> 6158.32s]  Oh, I got him.
[6158.96s -> 6159.84s]  I got him early too.
[6165.51s -> 6166.55s]  Oh, I could have gone for the counter.
[6167.27s -> 6173.19s]  There it is.
[6173.19s -> 6175.11s]  Dude, you are on point this game.
[6175.11s -> 6175.61s]  Yep.
[6216.79s -> 6217.27s]  There it is.
[6217.27s -> 6217.83s]  Nice stuff.
[6217.83s -> 6218.55s]  There we go.
[6218.55s -> 6219.59s]  You were on point that game.
[6220.15s -> 6220.79s]  I was gaming.
[6222.69s -> 6224.29s]  I probably did like 30 damage that game.
[6224.29s -> 6225.09s]  You're probably like 500.
[6226.45s -> 6227.41s]  You hard carried that game.
[6227.41s -> 6228.29s]  This place matters.
[6231.33s -> 6232.37s]  Four KOs, damn.
[6233.33s -> 6235.80s]  Nice game.
[6236.26s -> 6237.06s]  That was good.
[6237.92s -> 6238.16s]  All right.
[6238.16s -> 6239.20s]  I'll play Rhyndog now, guys.
[6241.25s -> 6242.21s]  We got to solidify the win.
[6242.77s -> 6246.07s]  You don't want to play Rhyndog?
[6246.07s -> 6248.07s]  You can play Rhyndog when we're just goofing around.
[6248.07s -> 6248.55s]  Oh, okay.
[6248.55s -> 6249.51s]  That's fair.
[6249.51s -> 6250.15s]  See, I agree.
[6250.71s -> 6251.43s]  They were just...
[6251.43s -> 6251.99s]  Some people were really...
[6251.99s -> 6254.15s]  There was like two Rhyndog fans that were really losing it.
[6257.88s -> 6259.80s]  He's literally like an original character.
[6259.80s -> 6261.32s]  Somebody just said, suck my ass.
[6262.12s -> 6264.77s]  Time that person up for like 35 seconds.
[6264.77s -> 6265.97s]  That's probably one of mine.
[6265.97s -> 6272.93s]  That's probably one of mine.
[6273.49s -> 6276.05s]  Yeah, that sounds like something one of my guys would say.
[6280.47s -> 6282.07s]  35 seconds or 35 years?
[6283.14s -> 6283.86s]  Somewhere in between.
[6284.58s -> 6285.86s]  Let's take the average.
[6285.86s -> 6289.64s]  All right, we got to solidify fourth place.
[6289.64s -> 6291.00s]  I'm happy with fourth place if we get it.
[6291.00s -> 6298.76s]  He's like a reindeer dog.
[6299.56s -> 6301.27s]  I just now realized that.
[6302.07s -> 6325.14s]  I'm trying to get the early knockout.
[6351.52s -> 6352.45s]  Hit that spike.
[6353.09s -> 6354.32s]  There it is.
[6354.32s -> 6354.80s]  Oh, what?
[6354.80s -> 6355.28s]  I guess not.
[6355.28s -> 6356.72s]  I almost got it.
[6356.72s -> 6375.01s]  There it is.
[6375.01s -> 6375.49s]  Nice job.
[6375.49s -> 6375.89s]  All right, get it.
[6375.89s -> 6376.29s]  Double it up.
[6376.85s -> 6387.81s]  There it is.
[6387.81s -> 6388.37s]  Nice job.
[6388.37s -> 6388.69s]  Okay.
[6389.25s -> 6390.98s]  We've done it again.
[6392.32s -> 6392.96s]  That was a good fight.
[6393.52s -> 6394.16s]  That was good.
[6394.16s -> 6394.64s]  We did it.
[6395.36s -> 6395.92s]  Fifth place.
[6396.80s -> 6398.80s]  No, this is fourth.
[6398.80s -> 6401.12s]  Looks like somebody is a sore loser.
[6401.12s -> 6402.40s]  They kept saying it was for fit.
[6402.40s -> 6403.60s]  You carried again.
[6403.60s -> 6404.64s]  Yeah, no, I just wanted to...
[6405.20s -> 6406.64s]  Yeah, we just wanted to goof.
[6406.64s -> 6408.00s]  Gift you a sub to Amaranth, really.
[6408.00s -> 6409.48s]  I'm just...
[6409.48s -> 6409.88s]  Thank you.
[6409.88s -> 6410.20s]  Good games.
[6410.20s -> 6410.52s]  Good games.
[6410.52s -> 6411.24s]  Appreciate it.
[6411.24s -> 6412.52s]  Trying to fund you guys.
[6413.32s -> 6415.40s]  Let me just get those going real quick.
[6415.40s -> 6416.92s]  Let me just exit out of multiverse.
[6416.92s -> 6417.80s]  This is a bad game.
[6417.80s -> 6418.60s]  You know what I mean?
[6418.60s -> 6420.18s]  That's a great game.
[6420.18s -> 6421.14s]  No, it's bad.
[6421.14s -> 6422.02s]  I think it's phenomenal.
[6422.02s -> 6423.70s]  It's a fantastic video game.
[6423.70s -> 6424.42s]  It is.
[6424.42s -> 6425.14s]  All right.
[6425.14s -> 6425.38s]  Well...
[6425.38s -> 6426.42s]  It's truly great.
[6426.42s -> 6427.80s]  Jerma, what are you eating?
[6429.46s -> 6431.41s]  Ham sandwich.
[6431.41s -> 6432.76s]  Any cheese?
[6432.76s -> 6433.56s]  No, no cheese.
[6433.56s -> 6434.98s]  Just mustard.
[6434.98s -> 6435.94s]  Just mustard and ham.
[6435.94s -> 6436.50s]  I like it.
[6436.50s -> 6437.86s]  Mustard ham and two...
[6437.86s -> 6438.82s]  Man of class.
[6438.82s -> 6440.90s]  One piece of whole wheat bread.
[6442.84s -> 6443.88s]  You don't even have two?
[6443.88s -> 6445.64s]  It's almost like a hot dog.
[6446.28s -> 6447.80s]  Your bread lasts a lot longer that way.
[6449.01s -> 6450.29s]  I mean, I guess that's true.
[6450.29s -> 6452.05s]  Is it a wrap then, almost?
[6452.05s -> 6455.41s]  You could fold it and eat it like a slice of pizza.
[6455.41s -> 6458.21s]  Interesting that you went with pizza on the fold it one.
[6458.77s -> 6460.77s]  And it's ham and mustard.
[6460.77s -> 6463.73s]  Ham, mustard, one piece of whole wheat.
[6463.73s -> 6465.25s]  Fold it up like a piece of pizza.
[6465.25s -> 6468.10s]  Take a bite, you're golden.
[6468.10s -> 6469.17s]  Maybe a little smoothie.
[6469.17s -> 6471.57s]  Honor, here's your tier...
[6471.57s -> 6473.73s]  I can't give the tier three to you.
[6473.73s -> 6475.25s]  Open face liar.
[6475.25s -> 6477.57s]  Told you, I'm already a son.
[6477.57s -> 6479.06s]  Wait, you're lying?
[6479.14s -> 6480.10s]  No, dude.
[6480.10s -> 6482.66s]  I just gifted Connor Eats Pant.
[6483.22s -> 6484.10s]  No, no, no, no.
[6484.10s -> 6484.42s]  Fuck.
[6486.10s -> 6486.58s]  Connor.
[6487.46s -> 6492.58s]  That is a 25 dollars down the drain there.
[6493.64s -> 6494.36s]  Oh, no.
[6495.17s -> 6495.49s]  Okay.
[6496.21s -> 6500.16s]  That is too bad.
[6500.16s -> 6501.92s]  You're not a sub, you piece of shit.
[6501.92s -> 6502.96s]  So I just...
[6502.96s -> 6505.06s]  Whoa.
[6505.06s -> 6505.70s]  Is this edible?
[6507.78s -> 6508.58s]  You're taking an edible?
[6509.14s -> 6509.70s]  What?
[6509.70s -> 6511.14s]  No, I said, is this edible?
[6512.82s -> 6513.94s]  The tier three sub?
[6515.86s -> 6517.06s]  This piece of this carrot.
[6517.06s -> 6518.47s]  This is not even a carrot.
[6518.47s -> 6520.07s]  This is like fucking spinach.
[6520.07s -> 6524.02s]  Oh, it was for the aesthetic.
[6524.02s -> 6525.35s]  And that's what it was.
[6525.35s -> 6528.95s]  Jerma, would you both go to...
[6529.59s -> 6532.18s]  Let me just make sure I don't type in the wrong one.
[6532.18s -> 6534.50s]  Jerma, nine, eight, five, right.
[6534.50s -> 6536.90s]  Would you guys do me a favor and go to her stream
[6536.90s -> 6539.70s]  to validate that I have, in fact, given you tier three emotes?
[6539.70s -> 6541.48s]  I'll find out.
[6541.48s -> 6543.88s]  Why can't I gift you a sub, Jerma?
[6543.88s -> 6544.69s]  I don't know.
[6544.69s -> 6545.17s]  Give me one?
[6547.38s -> 6549.70s]  I might have already been gifted this years.
[6549.70s -> 6550.37s]  Okay.
[6550.37s -> 6553.30s]  Is there another streamer that you would like a gifted sub to?
[6553.30s -> 6557.96s]  Um, Conrad Smith.
[6557.96s -> 6558.84s]  My God.
[6558.84s -> 6561.48s]  Incredible choice.
[6561.48s -> 6562.36s]  My God.
[6562.36s -> 6563.91s]  Holy shit.
[6563.91s -> 6564.31s]  Jerma.
[6564.31s -> 6567.38s]  Wait, I might be subbed to you too.
[6567.38s -> 6571.09s]  Wait, let's see.
[6571.09s -> 6572.21s]  Jerma, nine, eight, five.
[6572.21s -> 6575.56s]  Hey, I've got a chat I don't think he's subbed to.
[6575.56s -> 6576.20s]  No, you're good.
[6576.20s -> 6576.68s]  I got it.
[6576.68s -> 6577.24s]  I got it.
[6577.24s -> 6577.64s]  Oh, okay.
[6577.64s -> 6577.96s]  Here you go.
[6577.96s -> 6578.36s]  Got it.
[6578.36s -> 6578.68s]  Okay.
[6578.68s -> 6579.08s]  Not.
[6579.08s -> 6579.56s]  Okay.
[6579.56s -> 6580.36s]  That sucks.
[6580.36s -> 6580.76s]  There you go.
[6580.76s -> 6581.64s]  Now you can use the...
[6582.60s -> 6583.81s]  What do you have?
[6583.81s -> 6584.77s]  A gold car?
[6584.77s -> 6585.49s]  You got it.
[6585.49s -> 6586.77s]  Yeah, you got the gold frog.
[6586.77s -> 6587.33s]  Oh, shit.
[6587.33s -> 6587.73s]  There it is.
[6587.73s -> 6588.61s]  It's a tier three.
[6588.61s -> 6589.97s]  I thought we were doing tier one.
[6589.97s -> 6590.29s]  All right.
[6590.29s -> 6591.65s]  No, tier threes.
[6592.85s -> 6595.81s]  I think there's an emote of just some guy's face for tier three too.
[6595.81s -> 6597.89s]  Wait, let me do some emotes.
[6597.89s -> 6600.87s]  All right.
[6600.87s -> 6601.19s]  Let me try.
[6601.19s -> 6601.67s]  Where are we?
[6601.67s -> 6607.09s]  All right.
[6607.09s -> 6609.83s]  So what's the tier three?
[6609.83s -> 6611.83s]  Connor six, that guy's face.
[6611.83s -> 6615.14s]  Connor six, that guy's face is what I typed.
[6615.14s -> 6615.86s]  Okay.
[6615.86s -> 6616.50s]  Yeah, there's shit.
[6616.50s -> 6620.10s]  Well, it's like capital T and then G and then...
[6620.10s -> 6621.78s]  Connor six, that guy's face.
[6621.78s -> 6626.02s]  Connor, in your chat, can you use a tier three emote so we can...
[6626.02s -> 6628.16s]  I got to see that guy's face.
[6628.16s -> 6629.52s]  What is that guy's face?
[6629.52s -> 6634.31s]  So I did an emote contest and then like he submitted like emote ideas
[6634.31s -> 6637.19s]  and then one guy just submitted a photo of his face
[6637.19s -> 6639.19s]  and then it ended up winning for like tier three.
[6640.31s -> 6640.71s]  Really?
[6640.71s -> 6641.27s]  That's incredible.
[6641.27s -> 6644.31s]  Now there's an emote that's just that guy's face that I...
[6644.31s -> 6645.83s]  Connor six, that guy's face.
[6645.83s -> 6647.19s]  How many of these can I do?
[6647.19s -> 6647.99s]  There you go.
[6647.99s -> 6648.31s]  Okay.
[6648.31s -> 6649.11s]  Well, there he is.
[6650.07s -> 6650.79s]  There you go.
[6650.79s -> 6651.27s]  There we go.
[6653.03s -> 6654.07s]  What does Ammo have?
[6654.07s -> 6655.19s]  Does she have that guy's face?
[6655.19s -> 6656.07s]  I don't think so.
[6656.07s -> 6657.17s]  Maybe, we'll see.
[6660.24s -> 6660.56s]  All right.
[6660.56s -> 6662.80s]  Well, we're going to go play online.
[6662.80s -> 6664.00s]  I will see you guys.
[6664.00s -> 6665.60s]  Yeah, you guys have two letters.
[6665.60s -> 6666.08s]  Good match.
[6666.08s -> 6666.40s]  I appreciate it.
[6666.40s -> 6666.96s]  Good games.
[6666.96s -> 6668.48s]  Yeah, have a good game, guys.
[6668.48s -> 6669.92s]  Thanks for the tier three.
[6670.40s -> 6670.80s]  Yeah, dude.
[6670.80s -> 6671.28s]  No problem.
[6671.28s -> 6671.76s]  Anytime.
[6671.76s -> 6673.30s]  Get some good emotes now.
[6673.30s -> 6674.34s]  Nice to meet you.
[6674.34s -> 6677.32s]  Yeah, you too.
[6677.32s -> 6677.72s]  All right.
[6678.44s -> 6679.96s]  Let's show them up online.
[6679.96s -> 6681.96s]  Let's show the public matches.
[6681.96s -> 6682.68s]  You want to do some public?
[6682.68s -> 6685.64s]  Yeah, let's do some public matches.
[6685.64s -> 6688.08s]  We can just leave this right here.
[6688.08s -> 6689.04s]  I think so.
[6689.04s -> 6689.84s]  I think I can.
[6689.84s -> 6691.04s]  Oh, I got to pull you in again.
[6692.92s -> 6693.40s]  Oh, yeah.
[6693.40s -> 6694.28s]  I think so.
[6694.28s -> 6697.83s]  There we go.
[6697.83s -> 6701.11s]  I had to verify that was the real Scarlet Otter.
[6702.23s -> 6704.79s]  Yeah, so we got fourth place.
[6704.79s -> 6705.51s]  I'm OK with that.
[6706.07s -> 6708.82s]  Let's solidify that.
[6709.46s -> 6710.42s]  Fourth place is fine.
[6711.30s -> 6713.86s]  Maybe in the next one, we get third.
[6715.33s -> 6716.45s]  That's all right.
[6716.45s -> 6718.37s]  Once they add Johnny Bravo to the game.
[6719.25s -> 6720.29s]  Wait, how was it fifth place?
[6720.85s -> 6725.14s]  Is it really fifth?
[6725.14s -> 6725.46s]  No.
[6725.46s -> 6726.50s]  I'll say that.
[6726.50s -> 6729.25s]  How many teams were there?
[6729.25s -> 6730.45s]  I thought there was six teams.
[6739.78s -> 6740.90s]  You tied for fifth.
[6741.78s -> 6742.74s]  Four and a half place.
[6744.39s -> 6746.07s]  Fourth loses to third.
[6746.07s -> 6748.92s]  The tie was between fifth and sixth.
[6748.92s -> 6750.28s]  Oh, there were eight teams.
[6750.28s -> 6754.31s]  Oh, so now wouldn't we be tied for fourth?
[6754.31s -> 6762.50s]  Four and a half.
[6762.50s -> 6763.62s]  We're four and a half.
[6763.62s -> 6764.50s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[6764.50s -> 6765.22s]  That's right in the middle.
[6765.78s -> 6767.38s]  Why is the streamer so awkward?
[6767.38s -> 6768.50s]  That's just how I am, dude.
[6768.50s -> 6769.30s]  That's just like my phone.
[6769.30s -> 6769.78s]  Who said that?
[6770.58s -> 6771.70s]  Did they say that in my channel?
[6772.26s -> 6772.82s]  No.
[6772.82s -> 6773.62s]  Better not have.
[6773.62s -> 6780.64s]  Buy the Rhyndog skin.
[6780.64s -> 6783.27s]  No, we didn't even win the tournament, guys.
[6783.27s -> 6785.59s]  I don't have enough to buy the Rhyndog skin.
[6785.59s -> 6788.58s]  Oh, these guys have the buff.
[6791.54s -> 6792.18s]  They have what?
[6792.18s -> 6792.66s]  Oh, yeah.
[6792.66s -> 6793.78s]  Wait, is that actually a thing?
[6795.12s -> 6795.36s]  No.
[6797.76s -> 6798.80s]  Because I kept committing, too.
[6798.80s -> 6800.24s]  And I was like, wait, maybe he's serious
[6800.24s -> 6802.24s]  because we're getting kind of screwed up on this stage.
[6802.24s -> 6804.48s]  No, Velma is just really good.
[6804.48s -> 6805.44s]  Velma is really good.
[6805.44s -> 6811.67s]  Bugs is really good, too.
[6811.67s -> 6814.31s]  If you know what you're doing with Velma, you are terrifying.
[6821.84s -> 6822.16s]  Whoa.
[6822.16s -> 6823.20s]  I don't know what that does.
[6823.20s -> 6824.00s]  That was kind of crazy.
[6828.69s -> 6830.13s]  I'm just pressing buttons.
[6830.13s -> 6836.84s]  And maybe I'm a Rhyndog guy.
[6837.78s -> 6838.26s]  You might be.
[6850.87s -> 6851.27s]  Whoa.
[6851.27s -> 6852.79s]  How did he just didn't go off the screen?
[6852.79s -> 6853.27s]  That was weird.
[6854.07s -> 6859.24s]  Well, he's dead.
[6862.21s -> 6863.41s]  Why would I hit him up?
[6863.41s -> 6866.00s]  The Rhyndog is awesome.
[6868.74s -> 6869.94s]  You like Rhyndog?
[6869.94s -> 6870.74s]  He's awesome.
[6870.74s -> 6871.46s]  He's a little dog.
[6872.18s -> 6875.06s]  I don't know.
[6875.06s -> 6876.66s]  What noise does Rhyndog make?
[6876.66s -> 6877.70s]  He's a reindeer dog.
[6879.72s -> 6880.44s]  Yeah, I don't know.
[6880.44s -> 6881.24s]  Rhyndog?
[6881.24s -> 6882.12s]  Oh, that makes a lot more sense.
[6882.12s -> 6883.56s]  You got all four KOs.
[6884.76s -> 6885.24s]  Man.
[6885.24s -> 6886.92s]  Yeah, the Rhyndog thing.
[6886.92s -> 6890.63s]  The person just said, wait, I need to eat?
[6890.63s -> 6892.88s]  Did they just write that?
[6892.88s -> 6893.44s]  What?
[6893.44s -> 6894.80s]  This person just said, I got to go.
[6894.80s -> 6895.60s]  I have to eat.
[6895.60s -> 6897.41s]  I have to eat dinner or something.
[6897.41s -> 6899.38s]  Are they not allowed to go eat?
[6900.18s -> 6901.22s]  Was that like an emote?
[6903.68s -> 6904.72s]  It had an emote that said it.
[6904.72s -> 6905.68s]  What are you talking about?
[6905.68s -> 6907.76s]  Jake just said, hey, I got to go.
[6907.76s -> 6908.80s]  I got to eat.
[6908.80s -> 6909.84s]  Oh, OK.
[6909.84s -> 6910.24s]  I see.
[6910.24s -> 6913.12s]  I thought you're saying somebody in your chat said an emote that said,
[6913.12s -> 6913.60s]  I got to go eat.
[6913.60s -> 6914.80s]  I was like, what are you talking about?
[6914.80s -> 6916.96s]  What did it take up with the whole chat?
[6916.96s -> 6918.72s]  I was like, yeah, it's kind of a weird emote.
[6918.72s -> 6919.68s]  Hey, I got to go.
[6919.68s -> 6920.64s]  I've got to go eat.
[6920.64s -> 6922.40s]  It's like a 50-part emote.
[6926.00s -> 6928.96s]  Just if you leave the game, they have some dialogue sometimes.
[6928.96s -> 6930.24s]  This is a great choice.
[6930.24s -> 6931.04s]  Holy joy.
[6931.04s -> 6937.01s]  I forgot to.
[6937.01s -> 6942.48s]  I didn't pick Rain Dog.
[6942.48s -> 6943.44s]  That's so surreal.
[6944.08s -> 6951.65s]  Make sure you're filling up your thing.
[6951.65s -> 6952.45s]  Wait, get this off.
[6956.74s -> 6957.94s]  I'll put the Burger King guy on.
[6959.54s -> 6971.20s]  I think I'm going to try this game.
[6971.20s -> 6972.00s]  You actually should.
[6972.00s -> 6972.88s]  The game's fantastic.
[6978.88s -> 6980.56s]  Genuinely speaking, the game's very good.
[6980.56s -> 6984.87s]  It's really fun.
[6987.06s -> 6988.50s]  Oh, we're not sponsored today, guys.
[6988.50s -> 6988.82s]  Sorry.
[6988.82s -> 6989.78s]  That's not what this is.
[6989.78s -> 6990.74s]  This is not sponsored.
[6991.30s -> 6992.64s]  We're just playing.
[6992.64s -> 6995.19s]  I liked the game before I was sponsored.
[6995.19s -> 6995.91s]  You know what?
[6995.91s -> 6997.16s]  Me too.
[6997.16s -> 6999.56s]  I played it back when it was first in that little alpha.
[6999.56s -> 7000.28s]  They did whatever it was.
[7001.54s -> 7003.46s]  Don't you come talking smack to me.
[7004.02s -> 7014.76s]  That basketball just ruined everything he was doing.
[7016.05s -> 7017.81s]  You went Daffy in this game, right?
[7017.81s -> 7018.61s]  Oh, so bad.
[7019.33s -> 7020.52s]  That'd be cool.
[7021.16s -> 7025.78s]  It'd be cool if he had Duck Dodger's moves, too.
[7030.98s -> 7031.62s]  Missed that one.
[7032.18s -> 7032.66s]  My bad.
[7038.04s -> 7039.24s]  What the what?
[7039.24s -> 7045.72s]  Oh, my goodness.
[7058.56s -> 7060.08s]  Your favorite Looney Tunes episode?
[7061.80s -> 7070.08s]  Um, it's it's Tiny Tunes.
[7070.08s -> 7072.08s]  It's how I spent my summer vacation from franchise.
[7072.64s -> 7074.24s]  Oh, I used to love Tiny Tunes.
[7075.20s -> 7078.32s]  They were like different.
[7078.32s -> 7081.04s]  They weren't even like it wasn't bugs.
[7081.04s -> 7082.08s]  It was like different rabbits.
[7083.52s -> 7087.48s]  Yeah, they were like it was how I spent my summer vacation.
[7087.48s -> 7088.84s]  Happy Worldland.
[7088.84s -> 7094.20s]  It was the Flucky and Porky the Pig's son.
[7095.24s -> 7096.04s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7096.68s -> 7098.82s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[7098.82s -> 7100.82s]  I liked for Looney Tunes.
[7100.82s -> 7105.44s]  I like the one where like bugs like ghost like different.
[7105.44s -> 7106.72s]  Forgive me what it was.
[7106.72s -> 7109.20s]  Like different animation that mostly looks like it's like trap.
[7109.20s -> 7111.84s]  And then no, is it is it Daffy that does it at the end?
[7111.84s -> 7114.00s]  He's like, I can't even remember how to recall it.
[7114.64s -> 7115.76s]  Someone knows what I'm talking about.
[7116.80s -> 7118.98s]  Daffy gets like stuck in like something.
[7121.70s -> 7122.20s]  Sorry.
[7122.58s -> 7123.54s]  Sorry if I startled you.
[7124.10s -> 7124.66s]  No, you're fine.
[7129.46s -> 7130.34s]  Maybe so.
[7130.34s -> 7131.06s]  I don't know the name.
[7131.78s -> 7138.87s]  How am I still here?
[7140.48s -> 7141.04s]  There we go.
[7141.76s -> 7152.48s]  Oh, I missed it.
[7152.48s -> 7157.48s]  I can't believe LeBron James in this game.
[7158.28s -> 7158.84s]  It's crazy.
[7162.37s -> 7165.25s]  He thinks the next real person will add besides John Oliver.
[7165.25s -> 7166.13s]  So you don't have to do it.
[7171.08s -> 7172.20s]  Okay, the next real person.
[7174.15s -> 7174.65s]  Gandalf.
[7175.35s -> 7176.86s]  Gandalf.
[7177.40s -> 7179.00s]  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[7179.00s -> 7182.20s]  I mean, Gandalf is a the depiction of Gandalf.
[7182.20s -> 7184.68s]  They're going to use in this is like a real guy.
[7184.68s -> 7186.56s]  They're just going to use Ian McKellen.
[7186.56s -> 7189.49s]  Yeah, it's just Ian.
[7189.49s -> 7193.01s]  You know, I wouldn't be surprised if like they can't get the rights to like Gandalf
[7193.01s -> 7193.97s]  and Tolkien Estate.
[7193.97s -> 7198.71s]  So they just put in Ian McKellen and he has like some like wizard moves here and there.
[7198.71s -> 7199.75s]  Gandalf would be awesome.
[7202.32s -> 7203.52s]  Shaggy is not a real guy.
[7203.52s -> 7204.72s]  He's a cartoon character.
[7204.72s -> 7206.16s]  He's not a real person.
[7206.16s -> 7208.08s]  Actually, no, he is in the movies.
[7208.08s -> 7218.58s]  I kind of wish they just had like Shaggy that isn't like the meme Shaggy.
[7219.54s -> 7221.78s]  Like a Shaggy that's fighting with Scooby or something.
[7222.50s -> 7224.10s]  There's no way Scooby Doo is not in the game.
[7225.12s -> 7226.40s]  Yeah, that's crazy to me.
[7226.40s -> 7229.20s]  But I would have liked like Shaggy and Scooby as like a duo team
[7230.08s -> 7243.51s]  rather than like, oh, he's like he's like doing the meme like sing Tiny Tunes.
[7243.51s -> 7246.24s]  See if I can remember it.
[7250.36s -> 7251.08s]  We're tiny.
[7251.08s -> 7251.72s]  We're toony.
[7251.72s -> 7253.16s]  We're all a little loony.
[7253.16s -> 7253.96s]  Oh, my God.
[7253.96s -> 7256.20s]  And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV.
[7260.45s -> 7260.93s]  Fuck.
[7260.93s -> 7261.25s]  Hold on.
[7261.25s -> 7261.49s]  I lost.
[7261.49s -> 7262.29s]  I couldn't remember it.
[7262.29s -> 7264.28s]  And then you immediately brought it back to me.
[7264.28s -> 7265.00s]  We're tiny.
[7265.00s -> 7265.64s]  We're toony.
[7265.64s -> 7267.00s]  We're all a little loony.
[7267.00s -> 7272.34s]  And in this cartoony, we're invading your TV.
[7273.30s -> 7280.53s]  We cracked up all the sensors and Tiny Tune Adventures in a dose of harmony
[7280.53s -> 7285.38s]  when in Acme Acres, it's a whole wide world apart
[7285.38s -> 7289.38s]  that sets alone and made of stone and cartoon work of art.
[7289.38s -> 7292.05s]  Expect the expected.
[7292.05s -> 7293.65s]  Expect the unexpected.
[7293.65s -> 7296.13s]  With Tiny Tune Adventures, it's about to start.
[7296.93s -> 7298.52s]  I don't know.
[7298.52s -> 7299.16s]  It's something like that.
[7299.88s -> 7302.13s]  Oh, we're doing double.
[7302.13s -> 7303.25s]  I just realized what we're doing.
[7303.97s -> 7312.37s]  The thing I like doing with the brawn is you just bounce one of the balls down
[7312.37s -> 7313.57s]  and then you steal another.
[7313.57s -> 7314.61s]  So that just stays out.
[7314.61s -> 7317.17s]  There is like a thing that they keep bouncing into.
[7317.17s -> 7319.81s]  This is hell here, by the way, especially having to deal with this here.
[7338.31s -> 7338.55s]  What?
[7340.24s -> 7340.56s]  What?
[7341.12s -> 7345.09s]  How did I live?
[7345.89s -> 7348.20s]  Oh, my goodness.
[7348.20s -> 7348.68s]  This dude.
[7351.51s -> 7351.99s]  Wow.
[7351.99s -> 7352.31s]  We.
[7365.08s -> 7365.40s]  Whoa.
[7365.40s -> 7365.80s]  We.
[7365.80s -> 7366.28s]  That was weird.
[7367.40s -> 7376.50s]  You think LeBron even knows he's in this game or like when he signed this space jam contract,
[7376.50s -> 7378.02s]  it was like this was in here.
[7378.02s -> 7379.46s]  He didn't know this was here.
[7379.46s -> 7380.42s]  And he didn't know.
[7380.42s -> 7381.38s]  That's wicked funny.
[7382.34s -> 7397.28s]  Oh, he's just begging to be knocked over there.
[7397.28s -> 7397.84s]  OK, we're good.
[7400.24s -> 7406.36s]  Imagine like his son's like playing this game with his friends.
[7406.36s -> 7407.72s]  He walks through and he's like, is that me?
[7407.72s -> 7409.72s]  He's like, yeah, like you're in the game.
[7409.72s -> 7411.96s]  Do you think he's just like, all right, whatever.
[7412.84s -> 7413.80s]  Probably.
[7413.80s -> 7414.60s]  He has his voice.
[7414.60s -> 7415.72s]  He's like, is that me?
[7416.52s -> 7418.20s]  I can't tell.
[7418.20s -> 7419.32s]  Is it me talking?
[7420.31s -> 7421.51s]  I don't remember recording this.
[7422.07s -> 7428.34s]  Please change Omega L2.
[7428.34s -> 7431.14s]  Wowee.
[7431.14s -> 7432.74s]  It's not his voice.
[7432.74s -> 7435.14s]  Wait, it's an actor.
[7436.28s -> 7438.60s]  Yeah, it's not LeBron that voices him.
[7438.60s -> 7442.40s]  So there's a very real possibility that he does not know he's in this game.
[7442.40s -> 7443.44s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7443.44s -> 7444.16s]  You're right.
[7444.16s -> 7444.40s]  Wow.
[7444.40s -> 7444.96s]  OK.
[7444.96s -> 7447.76s]  Did you see space jam too?
[7447.76s -> 7450.88s]  No, it was probably one of the worst movies ever seen.
[7451.92s -> 7452.88s]  It was really that bad.
[7453.36s -> 7456.16s]  I saw that movie and I enjoyed the first space jam as a kid.
[7456.16s -> 7458.80s]  I know it's not great looking, but I was like, OK, it's fine.
[7458.80s -> 7459.84s]  Fun movie.
[7459.84s -> 7462.32s]  This one is just so unapologetically awful.
[7462.32s -> 7463.44s]  It hurt me.
[7463.44s -> 7465.20s]  Like I was in the theater.
[7465.20s -> 7466.56s]  I'm like, wow, this is upsetting.
[7466.56s -> 7468.40s]  Like, I actually want my money back.
[7468.40s -> 7469.20s]  What was wrong with it?
[7469.92s -> 7471.76s]  It was just none of the jokes were good.
[7471.76s -> 7473.84s]  The Looney Tunes weren't even like the Looney.
[7473.84s -> 7477.62s]  They didn't do any Looney Tunes like funny bits.
[7477.62s -> 7482.10s]  They were just kind of like character archetypes that weren't the Looney Tunes.
[7482.10s -> 7482.42s]  Really?
[7483.06s -> 7484.36s]  Yeah, it was very weird.
[7484.36s -> 7487.32s]  And then like LeBron is like his performance is awful.
[7487.32s -> 7492.60s]  I hate to say it, but he doesn't know how to like, you know, do that.
[7492.60s -> 7494.60s]  He doesn't know how to talk the Looney Tunes.
[7495.24s -> 7500.47s]  And then also like E3 was like a major like plot point of the film.
[7500.47s -> 7501.11s]  It didn't make any sense.
[7501.11s -> 7501.43s]  Hold on.
[7501.43s -> 7502.47s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7502.47s -> 7504.79s]  E E3 E3.
[7504.79s -> 7505.19s]  Yeah.
[7505.19s -> 7508.87s]  So LeBron's son is like, dad, I want to go to E3 camp.
[7508.87s -> 7512.00s]  And then LeBron's like, you can't go to E3 camp.
[7512.00s -> 7513.92s]  And then he's like, no, but dad, I want to.
[7513.92s -> 7516.48s]  And then the movie, it spoilers.
[7516.48s -> 7516.80s]  It ends.
[7516.80s -> 7518.66s]  The kid goes to E3 camp.
[7518.66s -> 7519.62s]  Oh, all right.
[7519.62s -> 7522.96s]  The whole time I'm watching, I'm like, E3 is not a camp.
[7522.96s -> 7524.08s]  E3 camp.
[7524.72s -> 7526.48s]  But it's literally the logo for E3.
[7526.48s -> 7527.52s]  Like they had the rights.
[7527.52s -> 7528.48s]  I don't know where it came from.
[7528.48s -> 7530.90s]  I'm like, it's not a camp.
[7530.90s -> 7532.34s]  That's so, that's strange.
[7532.34s -> 7540.28s]  That's odd.
[7540.28s -> 7543.70s]  And then it's like, they're all in a video game.
[7543.70s -> 7544.82s]  It's like the idea.
[7544.82s -> 7548.16s]  Like, oh, LeBron, you got sucked into the video game.
[7548.16s -> 7552.40s]  But then the video game is just like Don Cheadle's like AI imagination.
[7553.48s -> 7554.84s]  I feel like you're just making stuff up.
[7556.36s -> 7557.16s]  I'm literally not.
[7557.16s -> 7558.60s]  I mean, you can ask Chad.
[7558.60s -> 7559.88s]  I'm telling the truth.
[7559.88s -> 7564.07s]  And then, but like, it's like the metaverse.
[7564.07s -> 7566.07s]  I think it's the idea, but it's the metaverse.
[7566.07s -> 7568.95s]  If it was only Warner Bros characters that they own.
[7571.06s -> 7573.70s]  And so they jump like the entire first 40 minutes of the movie
[7573.70s -> 7575.86s]  is then just jumping between different properties
[7575.86s -> 7578.02s]  that like they are just Bugs Bunny and LeBron.
[7578.82s -> 7580.50s]  Like, they're like, oh, we're in Game of Thrones.
[7580.50s -> 7580.82s]  What?
[7580.82s -> 7581.70s]  And it's like, what?
[7581.70s -> 7582.42s]  DC?
[7582.42s -> 7583.22s]  Where's Batman?
[7583.22s -> 7585.22s]  And it's just like, remember all these things?
[7585.22s -> 7587.00s]  That's so weird.
[7587.00s -> 7589.40s]  I'm like, wait, where's like Daffy Duck?
[7589.40s -> 7590.68s]  Like, where is everybody?
[7590.68s -> 7601.43s]  So wait, how many minutes is Daffy Duck in the movie for?
[7601.43s -> 7604.02s]  He might have like three lives.
[7604.02s -> 7604.66s]  What?
[7604.74s -> 7605.89s]  Oh, I'm not even kidding.
[7606.45s -> 7607.33s]  You got to be shitting me.
[7614.50s -> 7615.62s]  Oh, my God.
[7615.62s -> 7616.82s]  I just got stuffed.
[7616.82s -> 7617.62s]  I got stuffed on.
[7622.21s -> 7624.21s]  I sort of went way quicker than that.
[7624.21s -> 7624.77s]  That was dumb.
[7625.49s -> 7632.96s]  Sure played more LeBron earlier.
[7632.96s -> 7634.32s]  I forgot I'm good with him.
[7634.32s -> 7641.25s]  There it goes.
[7643.75s -> 7645.27s]  I thought they were going to drop down more.
[7652.90s -> 7653.62s]  We're good.
[7653.62s -> 7655.91s]  I get to watch it and give it.
[7655.91s -> 7656.23s]  Should I?
[7656.23s -> 7656.63s]  Okay.
[7656.63s -> 7658.63s]  Should I watch the new movie?
[7659.51s -> 7661.09s]  I'd like to hear what you thought.
[7661.57s -> 7663.97s]  You want me to give you like a full review after I see it?
[7663.97s -> 7666.44s]  Yeah, I would like to hear it.
[7666.44s -> 7667.96s]  I mean, I also like don't want to wish that on you.
[7667.96s -> 7670.12s]  I feel like you'd be really upset, but.
[7670.12s -> 7670.44s]  Should I?
[7670.44s -> 7670.68s]  Okay.
[7670.68s -> 7671.94s]  Should I be interested?
[7671.94s -> 7672.18s]  All right.
[7672.18s -> 7672.58s]  How about this?
[7673.22s -> 7676.90s]  I will watch the movie and I will write you like a three or four paragraph
[7676.90s -> 7678.50s]  professional review of the movie.
[7678.50s -> 7679.38s]  Okay.
[7679.38s -> 7681.92s]  And you will you will read it on your stream.
[7681.92s -> 7682.32s]  Okay.
[7682.32s -> 7682.80s]  I'm done.
[7682.80s -> 7683.60s]  You don't do that?
[7683.60s -> 7684.00s]  Okay.
[7684.00s -> 7684.40s]  Yeah.
[7684.40s -> 7688.00s]  All right.
[7688.00s -> 7689.36s]  Just give me like back in action.
[7689.36s -> 7690.48s]  I love that movie as a kid.
[7690.48s -> 7693.04s]  I don't think it's very good looking back, but I used to love that.
[7693.04s -> 7694.55s]  Just give me six months.
[7694.55s -> 7694.79s]  Okay.
[7696.24s -> 7700.56s]  I mean, you got to make sure it's like proofread and those paragraphs are good.
[7702.07s -> 7703.43s]  Live tweet your reaction.
[7706.15s -> 7709.51s]  Great if like one of your like five, like four to five of your tweets in the year
[7709.51s -> 7712.44s]  are just like throughout Space Jam 2.
[7712.44s -> 7714.58s]  I actually think that's kind of funny.
[7717.49s -> 7721.62s]  Half of my tweets for the whole year or more are a live.
[7721.62s -> 7724.10s]  I'll lose thousands of followers, but do I really care?
[7726.40s -> 7730.16s]  If I tweet that much in one day, people are going to remember that they followed me like
[7730.16s -> 7732.80s]  eight years ago because they'll see me, right?
[7732.80s -> 7733.84s]  Because they never do.
[7733.84s -> 7736.98s]  Because I'm only in people's feeds like once every like three or four months.
[7736.98s -> 7739.94s]  So they will they will see it during the day and be like,
[7739.94s -> 7740.82s]  oh, should I follow this guy?
[7740.82s -> 7742.10s]  This guy sucks and unfollow me.
[7742.10s -> 7744.93s]  They're like, wait, who is this guy?
[7744.93s -> 7745.89s]  They click the link in your bio.
[7745.89s -> 7747.81s]  They're like, yeah, he hasn't uploaded in like eight years.
[7747.81s -> 7748.31s]  Yeah.
[7748.93s -> 7749.49s]  Yeah.
[7749.49s -> 7750.13s]  That's worth it.
[7750.13s -> 7751.01s]  Whatever.
[7751.01s -> 7758.44s]  Shut up, you asshole.
[7758.44s -> 7759.88s]  All your tweets get a lot of likes.
[7764.34s -> 7764.98s]  No, they don't.
[7764.98s -> 7765.48s]  Do they?
[7765.86s -> 7771.99s]  Let me check.
[7771.99s -> 7772.55s]  All right.
[7772.55s -> 7777.24s]  Connor, go read, go read out loud the last five.
[7777.24s -> 7779.16s]  That's not that's not the going live one.
[7779.16s -> 7781.57s]  So you have no, not the going live one.
[7781.57s -> 7785.49s]  We have I spent the last 20 minutes going line by line translating this old note
[7785.49s -> 7786.53s]  I had on my iPhone.
[7786.53s -> 7789.65s]  It was from a year ago, freaking out, trying to decipher its meaning.
[7789.65s -> 7790.45s]  Was I hacked?
[7790.45s -> 7792.05s]  Did I do this in my sleep?
[7792.05s -> 7793.25s]  Demon shit?
[7793.25s -> 7797.25s]  No, it's just the default pages template template with lorem ipsum.
[7797.25s -> 7799.81s]  I got 60K likes.
[7799.81s -> 7801.25s]  What did why?
[7802.13s -> 7802.61s]  I don't know.
[7802.61s -> 7806.87s]  Apparently it hit.
[7806.87s -> 7813.35s]  Even your hashtag ad, we got 10K people excited to see if we
[7813.35s -> 7817.11s]  we have everybody twerked and everybody gave a drug PSA.
[7817.11s -> 7817.67s]  Good luck.
[7818.31s -> 7818.79s]  Okay.
[7818.79s -> 7820.07s]  That's for the green screen footage.
[7826.10s -> 7827.94s]  You're probably going to go back a year, by the way.
[7829.14s -> 7831.38s]  I'm like looking through trying to see what like isn't like an announcement.
[7834.72s -> 7837.44s]  They are nerfed as again, or is he still like amazing?
[7837.44s -> 7839.68s]  I think they nerfed him pretty hard before complaining.
[7840.92s -> 7842.04s]  What happened there?
[7842.04s -> 7842.92s]  That was kind of a mess.
[7842.92s -> 7843.40s]  I don't know.
[7843.40s -> 7845.16s]  Honestly, I just couldn't get back.
[7845.16s -> 7846.28s]  I guess I ran out of specials.
[7846.28s -> 7848.92s]  Oh, nice.
[7848.92s -> 7849.72s]  Nice try.
[7849.72s -> 7850.28s]  Nice try.
[7850.28s -> 7850.60s]  Whatever.
[7863.84s -> 7865.52s]  What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
[7865.52s -> 7867.20s]  Like currently before saying special.
[7869.56s -> 7870.20s]  Stop doing that.
[7870.20s -> 7870.84s]  Stop doing that.
[7870.84s -> 7871.64s]  Stop doing that to me.
[7872.52s -> 7873.08s]  Okay, we're good.
[7873.08s -> 7873.48s]  Stop.
[7875.81s -> 7876.85s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[7876.85s -> 7878.29s]  We got fucking diarrhea on.
[7879.57s -> 7884.21s]  What is that guy's username?
[7886.36s -> 7887.48s]  Readableboy44.
[7892.21s -> 7892.69s]  Okay.
[7892.69s -> 7899.32s]  Well, then that guy's name is focus on these.
[7899.32s -> 7900.68s]  We can't lose to these guys.
[7900.68s -> 7901.80s]  We just did bad.
[7902.28s -> 7903.88s]  We can't lose to them.
[7903.88s -> 7905.00s]  We just did very.
[7905.00s -> 7905.72s]  All right.
[7905.72s -> 7905.96s]  All right.
[7905.96s -> 7906.44s]  We're going.
[7906.44s -> 7907.00s]  I got an idea.
[7919.32s -> 7922.34s]  I knew I should have taken that carrot at Albuquerque.
[7928.44s -> 7930.20s]  Double Rindog wins this matchup.
[7930.76s -> 7938.74s]  Level 21.
[7939.46s -> 7943.16s]  It's not fair.
[7943.16s -> 7946.28s]  They should they should delete your account when you get to level 20 on any character.
[7948.61s -> 7950.69s]  Yeah, like you got to play something else.
[7952.21s -> 7953.25s]  It's a free to play game.
[7953.25s -> 7953.81s]  Come on now.
[7953.81s -> 7954.69s]  Let people have a chance.
[7959.91s -> 7962.39s]  No, did you have a least favorite movie?
[7964.90s -> 7967.46s]  It's been a while since I've seen a movie that I genuinely really hated.
[7968.26s -> 7970.26s]  Yeah, I didn't have a least favorite until I saw that.
[7970.26s -> 7973.62s]  Honestly, that's become that's become least favorite ever upset me.
[7973.62s -> 7975.14s]  Well, because like even as like a kid, right?
[7975.14s -> 7977.94s]  I'd be like, oh, maybe they'll make a new Space Jam movie.
[7978.74s -> 7980.18s]  Like, oh, it'll come out one day.
[7980.18s -> 7981.30s]  And then it finally happened.
[7981.30s -> 7983.94s]  And then it was like, and you just hate you hated it.
[7983.94s -> 7987.30s]  It was everything I hated about what it possibly could have been.
[7988.26s -> 7996.52s]  Oh, how did that not hit?
[7997.32s -> 8002.80s]  What?
[8002.80s -> 8003.84s]  Excuse me.
[8003.84s -> 8005.12s]  What the fuck just happened?
[8023.04s -> 8029.78s]  Oh, oh, got it.
[8029.78s -> 8031.81s]  Hey, do you guys want a TV?
[8036.29s -> 8037.33s]  Do you guys want a TV, too?
[8037.33s -> 8040.21s]  I mean, wait a second, remove a game for a second.
[8040.21s -> 8041.97s]  I thought this was the person that we were playing in the game.
[8041.97s -> 8043.41s]  And I was like, is this voice chat?
[8045.08s -> 8045.80s]  They added that.
[8045.80s -> 8046.60s]  I'll chat.
[8046.60s -> 8047.00s]  I'll chat.
[8048.04s -> 8050.85s]  Oh, we got we got it right there.
[8050.85s -> 8051.09s]  All right.
[8051.09s -> 8052.37s]  That's that's one on one.
[8052.37s -> 8053.49s]  That's one on one.
[8056.31s -> 8058.07s]  Do you guys want to play when you're done with this, though?
[8058.07s -> 8058.55s]  Or not?
[8059.54s -> 8060.58s]  Yeah, we'll play a game, too.
[8060.58s -> 8062.02s]  Yeah, I'm done.
[8062.02s -> 8062.52s]  Okay.
[8064.28s -> 8065.00s]  I'll add you guys.
[8065.00s -> 8066.36s]  Did you put your info?
[8066.36s -> 8067.72s]  Yeah, it's in there somewhere, I think.
[8067.72s -> 8068.44s]  Yeah, I have mine.
[8068.44s -> 8070.21s]  Do you both request?
[8070.21s -> 8070.85s]  Sick.
[8070.85s -> 8071.25s]  Thank you.
[8071.97s -> 8073.09s]  Mine's not really in there.
[8073.09s -> 8074.45s]  It's I forgot the numbers.
[8075.25s -> 8076.53s]  Yeah, it's like Scarlett something.
[8081.16s -> 8083.56s]  Look, it's focused on these join the voice chat.
[8084.52s -> 8085.08s]  Yeah, it did.
[8089.60s -> 8090.40s]  I don't know.
[8090.40s -> 8091.28s]  I don't know my username.
[8105.04s -> 8106.08s]  And your username?
[8106.08s -> 8106.58s]  Why?
[8107.04s -> 8108.48s]  I don't want to be German 985.
[8109.04s -> 8113.84s]  Someone probably already is German 985.
[8113.84s -> 8114.48s]  Yeah, guys.
[8114.48s -> 8117.68s]  I'm sure it's probably been taken like 5,000 different versions of the name.
[8121.60s -> 8122.92s]  Why not?
[8122.92s -> 8128.79s]  Because back in the TF2 days, this is a real story.
[8128.79s -> 8132.95s]  Back in the TF2 days, if I was if you were like making YouTube videos
[8134.05s -> 8136.69s]  or whatever, if you were streaming, whatever, not not back then.
[8136.69s -> 8141.89s]  But if your name was like German 985 and it was like confirmed that that's you,
[8142.53s -> 8145.65s]  it'd be 30 people lining up to high five you and the game would be ruined.
[8147.00s -> 8148.92s]  I'm trying to take myself out of the equation.
[8149.48s -> 8150.20s]  It's not me.
[8150.20s -> 8151.56s]  This is just a person playing the game.
[8152.20s -> 8155.30s]  So I always just ever since I did it like that.
[8156.80s -> 8159.52s]  That's what I when people recognize me in a game, I'm just like,
[8159.52s -> 8160.56s]  oh my God, is that Connor?
[8160.56s -> 8161.76s]  I'm like, no, I'm just a fan.
[8164.08s -> 8172.44s]  That's why I used to my names used to be like car dealership,
[8172.44s -> 8173.88s]  like 200 or something.
[8173.88s -> 8175.32s]  And people just be like, who the fuck is this guy?
[8175.32s -> 8175.96s]  200.
[8175.96s -> 8177.56s]  Yeah, I've played with that guy.
[8178.12s -> 8178.84s]  Yeah, he was pretty good.
[8179.64s -> 8184.47s]  Watch that hit.
[8184.47s -> 8185.43s]  Oh, my God.
[8185.43s -> 8186.47s]  That was disgusting.
[8187.03s -> 8188.39s]  Oh, my goodness gracious.
[8188.39s -> 8190.71s]  That was a that was a delicious combo.
[8190.71s -> 8191.91s]  That was ridiculous.
[8192.71s -> 8209.65s]  All right.
[8209.65s -> 8210.69s]  They're going to try to run back here.
[8210.69s -> 8211.01s]  Careful.
[8228.58s -> 8229.22s]  Good, good, good.
[8232.07s -> 8234.47s]  Oh, he almost finished that Superman.
[8235.19s -> 8252.16s]  There he goes.
[8252.80s -> 8258.05s]  Oh, he grabbed me from behind.
[8258.85s -> 8259.97s]  There it goes.
[8259.97s -> 8260.29s]  All right.
[8260.29s -> 8260.77s]  Here we go.
[8263.76s -> 8265.20s]  Good fight.
[8266.71s -> 8267.27s]  Good fight.
[8267.99s -> 8268.63s]  That two one.
[8269.36s -> 8269.76s]  That is it.
[8269.76s -> 8270.16s]  Yeah.
[8270.16s -> 8272.00s]  You fucked up, boy.
[8272.00s -> 8274.28s]  Yeah, we kicked their ass.
[8274.28s -> 8275.00s]  Good to hear.
[8275.00s -> 8278.52s]  I sent you both friend requests so we can add you.
[8278.52s -> 8280.68s]  Uh, German, I think you're the host.
[8280.68s -> 8281.24s]  Oh, yeah.
[8281.88s -> 8283.91s]  I added it.
[8283.91s -> 8284.71s]  Dr. Battle.
[8285.60s -> 8285.92s]  Yep.
[8288.61s -> 8293.64s]  Oh, wait, we're not doing a we're just inviting everybody to a party.
[8293.64s -> 8294.12s]  Can you do that?
[8294.12s -> 8295.64s]  Or are we doing custom game?
[8295.64s -> 8297.64s]  I was just going to do it the way I didn't turn custom.
[8297.64s -> 8297.96s]  Yeah.
[8297.96s -> 8298.28s]  Oh, OK.
[8298.28s -> 8298.52s]  Yeah.
[8299.24s -> 8301.24s]  I've got the custom set up.
[8301.24s -> 8301.72s]  Oh, yeah.
[8301.72s -> 8301.96s]  Yeah.
[8304.05s -> 8305.24s]  Are we friends?
[8305.24s -> 8306.68s]  Because I have that Dr. Battle, right?
[8306.76s -> 8308.12s]  Gave me error except.
[8308.12s -> 8310.52s]  Yeah, I got you.
[8310.52s -> 8312.36s]  Oh, I got Scarlet Otter.
[8312.36s -> 8313.96s]  OK, sending an invite there.
[8313.96s -> 8315.88s]  Uh, German, you may not have to invite me.
[8315.88s -> 8317.96s]  And then you could invite him and I'm going to invite you.
[8317.96s -> 8319.08s]  Yeah, I'll pull them.
[8319.08s -> 8327.16s]  Is there a bracket or a mainstream for this tournament anywhere?
[8327.72s -> 8330.52s]  The guy's on YouTube and not on this site.
[8333.27s -> 8344.66s]  And then I'll pull you now.
[8344.66s -> 8347.44s]  Very cool.
[8347.44s -> 8349.28s]  So yeah, who's did they finish?
[8349.28s -> 8350.40s]  Who's who's?
[8350.40s -> 8353.12s]  No, they're they're in like losers finals right now, I think.
[8353.12s -> 8354.32s]  Or maybe they're starting grands.
[8354.32s -> 8355.28s]  I don't remember.
[8355.28s -> 8360.10s]  Who's who's one and two or who's like the top four right now?
[8360.10s -> 8362.42s]  It's Stans and Alpharad.
[8362.42s -> 8366.18s]  I think they're in game three and they're in game three.
[8366.18s -> 8369.62s]  And then it's Jesse and Slick waiting and winners of grands.
[8369.62s -> 8371.46s]  And me and Sheep got fourth place.
[8371.46s -> 8375.54s]  Yeah, we had the worst seating.
[8375.54s -> 8375.86s]  Yeah.
[8375.86s -> 8376.02s]  Yeah.
[8376.02s -> 8379.24s]  Would you guys start off against Slick?
[8379.24s -> 8379.80s]  Oh, yeah.
[8379.80s -> 8381.00s]  Yeah, they were in the same.
[8381.00s -> 8381.88s]  They're very good.
[8381.88s -> 8384.20s]  That was the only one because we lost to Stans as well.
[8384.76s -> 8388.72s]  But I felt like those were close, but Jesse and Slick.
[8388.72s -> 8389.68s]  Fucked us up.
[8389.68s -> 8393.78s]  Yeah, we we were pretty close on the second game with them.
[8393.78s -> 8395.68s]  Yeah.
[8395.68s -> 8396.80s]  Here comes the heat.
[8396.80s -> 8411.89s]  You know, please don't play on the Steven Universe stage again.
[8411.89s -> 8413.35s]  Well, we can't we can't.
[8414.15s -> 8416.15s]  Well, everybody hates the Steven Universe.
[8417.57s -> 8419.24s]  The Rick and Morty stage.
[8419.24s -> 8421.96s]  Actually, can we adjust the map pool in a custom?
[8421.96s -> 8422.44s]  I think so.
[8422.44s -> 8424.76s]  You can pick a specific one, but can you just like take one out?
[8425.48s -> 8426.68s]  Yeah, you can take one out.
[8426.68s -> 8427.96s]  I don't know how you pick a specific one.
[8428.68s -> 8431.83s]  I don't either.
[8432.47s -> 8434.79s]  Oh, shit, I got to pick a character.
[8436.20s -> 8440.55s]  Why aren't my my perks aren't like unlocked?
[8440.55s -> 8442.48s]  That was weird.
[8442.48s -> 8443.04s]  I just played.
[8443.04s -> 8444.00s]  I just picked a bunch of perks.
[8444.00s -> 8444.48s]  I don't know.
[8445.20s -> 8447.11s]  Well, we haven't locked in yet.
[8447.11s -> 8448.23s]  Oh, I enjoy.
[8448.23s -> 8450.23s]  Oh, that's why I was like, what?
[8450.95s -> 8451.75s]  Look who it is.
[8452.39s -> 8454.16s]  Oh, yeah.
[8454.16s -> 8456.16s]  Those guys, one of them had an iron giant, right?
[8457.32s -> 8460.60s]  I heard they were reducing iron giant size by like 70 percent.
[8460.60s -> 8463.16s]  He's going to be shorter than like Bugs Bunny in the next patch.
[8464.28s -> 8465.16s]  They heard a lot of times.
[8465.16s -> 8466.58s]  I know.
[8466.58s -> 8467.22s]  Iron guy.
[8468.76s -> 8478.32s]  Iron gentleman.
[8478.32s -> 8479.36s]  It's that orchestra one.
[8479.36s -> 8483.46s]  Please, we can't hear it anymore.
[8483.46s -> 8485.78s]  We'll turn the sound off and put on
[8487.32s -> 8489.08s]  put on like your favorite podcast.
[8489.08s -> 8496.63s]  The Stains show, which needs a new episode.
[8496.63s -> 8497.99s]  We've been working on it.
[8497.99s -> 8500.29s]  I'm going to laugh if we're just on that stage.
[8500.29s -> 8501.86s]  The person is going to leave.
[8501.86s -> 8503.70s]  It's Rick and Morty.
[8503.70s -> 8506.60s]  Oh, yeah, it's Rick and Morty.
[8506.60s -> 8507.64s]  Rick and Morty.
[8507.64s -> 8512.68s]  Let's do it.
[8533.80s -> 8534.30s]  Freeze.
[8540.10s -> 8540.50s]  It's true.
[8540.50s -> 8541.94s]  You cannot guard LeBron.
[8541.94s -> 8543.94s]  Oh, he's six foot eight.
[8543.94s -> 8544.50s]  He's the goat.
[8546.32s -> 8548.40s]  Oh, so you can hit him with the car.
[8549.20s -> 8558.50s]  You're into that shit.
[8559.14s -> 8561.56s]  I should have gone LeBron against iron giant.
[8561.56s -> 8563.41s]  I feel like he fucks him up.
[8563.97s -> 8565.09s]  You are LeBron.
[8565.09s -> 8565.72s]  I know.
[8565.72s -> 8567.00s]  But when we fought slick.
[8567.00s -> 8578.13s]  Oh, I was like, I was like, oh, no, that was supposed to be a punch.
[8582.08s -> 8587.03s]  Oh, oh, very cool.
[8587.03s -> 8587.53s]  Superman.
[8589.03s -> 8593.16s]  Oh, my God.
[8593.16s -> 8593.96s]  How am I still on stage?
[8594.68s -> 8597.25s]  I don't know.
[8597.25s -> 8599.17s]  Oh, that was close.
[8602.21s -> 8604.05s]  What did you bounce off something?
[8604.05s -> 8604.69s]  I don't know.
[8604.69s -> 8605.65s]  I like bounced back.
[8606.53s -> 8610.56s]  I feel like that happened to me a couple of times in the tournament, to be honest.
[8611.36s -> 8612.40s]  There I go.
[8612.40s -> 8618.31s]  I don't pay to lose or to die.
[8618.95s -> 8619.45s]  Oh, no.
[8620.68s -> 8621.88s]  Get out of here, LeBron.
[8621.88s -> 8629.57s]  Oh, I'm in gun mode.
[8630.37s -> 8631.09s]  You're not a gun.
[8632.52s -> 8633.64s]  I feel like the gun mode is working.
[8634.52s -> 8635.16s]  I'm in it, too.
[8635.88s -> 8636.38s]  Shooting.
[8637.08s -> 8638.44s]  They don't know what to do.
[8640.79s -> 8641.29s]  Damn.
[8641.67s -> 8645.22s]  You guys are sticking around.
[8646.82s -> 8651.16s]  That ain't good.
[8651.80s -> 8652.28s]  We're all right.
[8653.48s -> 8657.59s]  You're like another hunter on me and I'll be done.
[8660.80s -> 8661.28s]  Oh, my goodness.
[8661.28s -> 8662.00s]  I thought you flew off.
[8662.72s -> 8668.20s]  How the hell are you not dead?
[8668.84s -> 8669.56s]  Iron giant.
[8670.20s -> 8671.96s]  It's OK to die.
[8671.96s -> 8672.84s]  It's not OK to kill.
[8673.72s -> 8677.84s]  Boy, the Superman.
[8681.97s -> 8683.28s]  Damn it.
[8683.28s -> 8684.40s]  That was supposed to be a punch.
[8684.40s -> 8684.90s]  Grab me.
[8691.00s -> 8691.50s]  Oh, no.
[8697.75s -> 8699.35s]  Oh, goodbye.
[8699.35s -> 8699.85s]  Whoa.
[8701.27s -> 8701.91s]  That was sick.
[8701.91s -> 8702.41s]  That was sick.
[8702.41s -> 8703.11s]  I almost brought it back.
[8703.11s -> 8703.61s]  I tried.
[8703.61s -> 8704.39s]  That was really close.
[8704.39s -> 8706.71s]  Superman's tough to finish.
[8706.71s -> 8707.21s]  Yeah.
[8707.21s -> 8708.39s]  He's so annoying.
[8708.39s -> 8709.03s]  He's tricky.
[8710.68s -> 8712.28s]  I feel like the iron giant's got that, too.
[8712.92s -> 8714.92s]  Like, you got to follow up on him to kill him
[8714.92s -> 8717.16s]  because it's going to be hard to kill him just from the stage.
[8717.16s -> 8719.16s]  Yeah, you got to like bounce, bounce, bounce.
[8719.16s -> 8719.72s]  Just follow him up.
[8719.72s -> 8720.84s]  Especially when you start flying.
[8720.84s -> 8722.12s]  It's just like just going to the feet.
[8722.12s -> 8724.42s]  Just trying to knock him a little higher.
[8724.42s -> 8725.30s]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[8725.30s -> 8726.34s]  He's huge.
[8726.34s -> 8727.54s]  Stop eating raw pork.
[8727.54s -> 8728.82s]  I've been eating carrots.
[8728.82s -> 8730.18s]  What are people talking about?
[8730.18s -> 8731.68s]  Real carrots or baby carrots?
[8731.68s -> 8733.20s]  Raw pork is very dangerous.
[8733.20s -> 8735.76s]  Just the carrots that are like a big pencil.
[8735.76s -> 8737.04s]  You know what I mean?
[8737.04s -> 8737.36s]  OK.
[8737.36s -> 8743.28s]  Yeah, it's audible.
[8743.28s -> 8744.64s]  It's very clear.
[8745.12s -> 8746.16s]  Any doctors here?
[8746.16s -> 8748.80s]  If I eat carrots for four hours, is that bad?
[8748.80s -> 8750.96s]  I've been eating carrots for two straight hours.
[8750.96s -> 8751.84s]  No, that's fine.
[8751.84s -> 8753.28s]  You probably can't OD on carrots.
[8753.28s -> 8757.20s]  I think if you ate carrots for four hours straight every day,
[8757.20s -> 8760.16s]  then eventually you're going to start shitting weird or something.
[8760.16s -> 8761.60s]  But I don't think you're going to be in danger.
[8765.04s -> 8769.89s]  God.
[8769.89s -> 8771.89s]  You can turn orange if you eat too many carrots.
[8771.89s -> 8774.47s]  That sounds like a lie.
[8774.47s -> 8775.11s]  How do I look?
[8775.11s -> 8783.30s]  It's double LeBron.
[8783.30s -> 8784.26s]  Oh, no.
[8784.26s -> 8785.64s]  Yeah, we'll be in weirdos.
[8785.64s -> 8787.40s]  There's going to be so many basketballs.
[8787.40s -> 8787.90s]  I know.
[8788.62s -> 8789.42s]  Two, I guess.
[8789.42s -> 8792.78s]  But I think you can have four active though, can't he?
[8792.78s -> 8794.06s]  Like two, I mean, two at a time.
[8794.87s -> 8795.19s]  Yep.
[8795.19s -> 8797.03s]  Can you have one that's like free falling
[8797.03s -> 8798.87s]  and then he can still do basketball moves?
[8798.87s -> 8800.79s]  Yeah, if you bounce one, his down special.
[8801.43s -> 8804.62s]  OK, I said I turned orange eating too many carrots
[8804.62s -> 8806.22s]  one time at the hospital.
[8806.22s -> 8806.72s]  What?
[8807.18s -> 8808.54s]  That's what that guy said.
[8808.54s -> 8809.26s]  I don't say that.
[8810.14s -> 8811.13s]  Watch out.
[8811.93s -> 8837.94s]  Wrong way.
[8837.94s -> 8842.78s]  Jesus, I'm getting dunked on by the all-time scoring leader.
[8842.78s -> 8843.28s]  Yep.
[8843.74s -> 8851.85s]  It might be a double LeBron team, Jeremy.
[8851.85s -> 8852.57s]  This might be us.
[8853.13s -> 8854.65s]  We've been playing well with the double LeBron.
[8864.52s -> 8866.60s]  Oh, I'm trying to play around here.
[8866.60s -> 8867.16s]  That was close.
[8884.81s -> 8885.29s]  Oh, my God.
[8886.01s -> 8886.81s]  We're going crazy.
[8888.33s -> 8889.05s]  Bounce, bounce.
[8889.77s -> 8892.89s]  I don't think teams should be allowed to have
[8892.89s -> 8894.97s]  eight finals wins combined.
[8900.74s -> 8902.42s]  That was lucky that I stayed alive.
[8904.02s -> 8913.69s]  Give me that ball.
[8937.67s -> 8938.71s]  Oh, my goodness.
[8945.91s -> 8947.03s]  Oh, I thought I hit him.
[8947.03s -> 8947.83s]  Oh, it's all right.
[8947.83s -> 8948.33s]  Good.
[8950.66s -> 8953.46s]  Yeah, that was that was.
[8953.46s -> 8955.70s]  Oh, we're saying I thought we do you end of the game
[8955.70s -> 8957.06s]  when you've got Connor.
[8957.62s -> 8958.98s]  I thought we knew when we won.
[8963.00s -> 8964.92s]  Look at how happy LeBron's are.
[8964.92s -> 8967.40s]  How come they couldn't get LeBron to do the voice lines?
[8968.04s -> 8969.40s]  We were talking about that earlier.
[8969.40s -> 8970.92s]  He doesn't know he's in the game.
[8970.92s -> 8972.52s]  I heard that they're working on that, though.
[8973.72s -> 8975.48s]  I watched a video that talked about this game
[8975.48s -> 8977.72s]  and they said that LeBron was going to do the voice lines.
[8978.20s -> 8980.68s]  Either they're misinformed or they're not.
[8981.64s -> 8983.00s]  I guess it has to be one of them, right?
[8983.80s -> 8986.17s]  All right, let's change it up.
[8986.17s -> 8986.65s]  What do I want to do?
[8986.65s -> 8989.05s]  People just like lie for no reason sometimes.
[8990.60s -> 8991.48s]  Yeah, it's true.
[8998.34s -> 8999.54s]  Kind of insta locked LeBron.
[8999.54s -> 9000.34s]  I should have changed it.
[9002.50s -> 9004.18s]  Jerma, your eyes are turning orange.
[9004.82s -> 9008.76s]  Yeah, a lot of people have been saying that.
[9009.40s -> 9011.83s]  LeBron's really fun to play.
[9014.07s -> 9014.71s]  Yeah, he's great.
[9019.58s -> 9022.28s]  Play Bugs Bunny, you carrot eater.
[9022.28s -> 9023.72s]  I think I played bugs all day.
[9024.36s -> 9027.13s]  What we got?
[9027.13s -> 9035.00s]  So how do you guys like the game?
[9035.00s -> 9036.36s]  I think it's fine.
[9036.36s -> 9038.68s]  I don't I play melee mostly, so I don't know
[9039.24s -> 9040.84s]  how much I'm going to not play melee for this,
[9040.84s -> 9042.84s]  but I'm having fun being there and giant.
[9042.84s -> 9044.60s]  Yeah, I like it.
[9044.60s -> 9048.38s]  I don't know how much competitive legs it has, but it's fun.
[9053.43s -> 9055.59s]  You were playing a lot during the first day, right?
[9055.59s -> 9057.03s]  Or do you think I saw?
[9057.03s -> 9060.39s]  He yeah, I played a decent during their first video.
[9060.39s -> 9061.51s]  I played it off stream a lot, too.
[9066.71s -> 9067.43s]  I really like it.
[9068.92s -> 9069.56s]  I found it.
[9069.56s -> 9070.36s]  Yeah, it's fun.
[9072.38s -> 9073.66s]  I like just the netcode alone.
[9073.66s -> 9074.78s]  It's like enough for me to want to play it.
[9075.50s -> 9075.74s]  Yeah.
[9080.71s -> 9084.31s]  Amazing how like Nintendo still doesn't have like an online system.
[9086.57s -> 9091.50s]  I mean, the idea is if, you know,
[9091.50s -> 9094.14s]  if Warner Brothers is going to support this and really care about it,
[9094.14s -> 9095.66s]  then oh, yeah, hope they do.
[9095.66s -> 9095.90s]  Yeah.
[9096.62s -> 9101.18s]  Did you see that information about how much people like Evo is this last weekend
[9101.18s -> 9104.86s]  and like fifth place for multiverses, which was a side game,
[9104.86s -> 9107.50s]  got more than like first place for some of the main games?
[9107.50s -> 9107.90s]  Really?
[9108.62s -> 9108.86s]  Yeah.
[9109.50s -> 9110.54s]  Like, holy shit.
[9110.54s -> 9113.18s]  I think 17th place for multiverses.
[9113.18s -> 9117.42s]  Again, a side game got more than like fifth place for some games or something.
[9117.42s -> 9120.14s]  There was a practical task tweet about it.
[9120.14s -> 9121.42s]  I can't remember all the details,
[9121.42s -> 9124.22s]  but Warner Brothers put a lot of money into this game.
[9124.22s -> 9125.74s]  They should do something for this tournament.
[9127.74s -> 9128.30s]  That'd be cool.
[9129.42s -> 9132.97s]  I think maybe four, even fifth.
[9132.97s -> 9133.45s]  I don't know.
[9134.65s -> 9135.93s]  Tied for fifth place should have seen,
[9135.93s -> 9138.65s]  you know, seven hundred thousand dollars or something like that.
[9138.65s -> 9139.13s]  Yeah.
[9139.13s -> 9144.09s]  I take which means fourth place is probably one point two at that point, right?
[9145.45s -> 9147.05s]  Yeah, that'd be like one point three.
[9147.93s -> 9148.89s]  Yeah, maybe.
[9148.89s -> 9149.69s]  Say that makes sense.
[9151.05s -> 9154.41s]  I'll take like two bucks or something at this point.
[9160.46s -> 9161.34s]  That was crazy.
[9161.34s -> 9163.26s]  Did you just run out of resources?
[9163.26s -> 9165.58s]  Yeah, I just was hoping I caught somebody in it.
[9165.58s -> 9166.78s]  Ran out of basketballs.
[9168.44s -> 9170.36s]  I mean, I feel like you guys just went easy on us
[9170.36s -> 9171.88s]  because you didn't go double LeBron again.
[9174.66s -> 9177.22s]  My Taz was not was not very good that round.
[9180.09s -> 9184.47s]  Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know, like a 50 to 100 million dollar tournament.
[9184.47s -> 9187.03s]  You know, the first hundred places get, you know,
[9187.03s -> 9191.06s]  place 100 gets like two hundred thousand something like that.
[9191.06s -> 9195.14s]  And it's just people that Ludwig knows off the top of his head and in the tournament,
[9195.14s -> 9197.06s]  not like top players only or anything.
[9197.06s -> 9200.18s]  Just, you know, what's the biggest?
[9200.18s -> 9201.62s]  What's the biggest prize pool ever?
[9201.62s -> 9204.14s]  Is it that Dota tournament?
[9204.14s -> 9205.02s]  Oh, like ever, ever.
[9205.02s -> 9206.54s]  But it's not a lot of big ones.
[9206.54s -> 9209.99s]  Don't just have like 10 to 20 million, right?
[9209.99s -> 9213.67s]  I I want to say it's got to be Dota, but I'm not 100% sure.
[9213.67s -> 9219.29s]  I know that I know CS has had some really big prize pools,
[9219.29s -> 9220.49s]  but I don't know if they can.
[9220.49s -> 9223.77s]  Yeah, your Dota two had a forty seven million.
[9223.77s -> 9224.33s]  Wow.
[9225.53s -> 9226.01s]  Wow.
[9226.01s -> 9227.21s]  I was saying that as a joke.
[9227.21s -> 9228.17s]  That actually happened.
[9228.89s -> 9232.68s]  How many people get a million?
[9232.68s -> 9234.92s]  Like, is that just the winning team or is it like the top?
[9234.92s -> 9235.96s]  It's a prize pool.
[9235.96s -> 9237.24s]  So I imagine it was spread.
[9237.32s -> 9238.68s]  That's probably probably spread.
[9238.68s -> 9241.88s]  That's like winning the mega millions jackpot.
[9241.88s -> 9243.72s]  That's like the type of crazy number.
[9243.72s -> 9247.08s]  That's like life changing in a way that is changing
[9247.08s -> 9250.76s]  like the future generations of your life of your family's way, too.
[9250.76s -> 9252.44s]  That's going to be like a money laundering.
[9252.44s -> 9255.78s]  Eighteen million over 18 million went to team one.
[9255.78s -> 9256.74s]  There's no way.
[9256.74s -> 9257.78s]  How much was team two?
[9258.98s -> 9262.33s]  Because team two got like nine million.
[9262.33s -> 9265.61s]  Can you imagine playing a game of Dota for nine million dollars?
[9266.57s -> 9268.01s]  I would I would shit my pants.
[9268.97s -> 9271.13s]  I better hit you at the right time.
[9271.13s -> 9273.69s]  Otherwise, I might lose nine million dollars.
[9273.69s -> 9275.77s]  I probably would fucking puke, right?
[9275.77s -> 9281.13s]  Like it's so much like nerves like, geez, like 10 million, 20 million dollars.
[9281.13s -> 9284.33s]  But at the same time, you've already won nine million.
[9284.33s -> 9285.45s]  So maybe the nerves go away.
[9285.45s -> 9286.33s]  You're like, I'm already sad.
[9286.33s -> 9290.97s]  This is just extra difference between nine and 18 million dollars.
[9290.97s -> 9294.42s]  Really true.
[9295.22s -> 9300.89s]  Hey, what's the best liberon that I can just use?
[9301.61s -> 9304.57s]  Uh, his side special is like almost instant kill
[9304.57s -> 9307.77s]  if they have at least 50 to 60 damage or at least like 70.
[9307.77s -> 9311.13s]  Don't it has no priority, though, so you really have to land it.
[9315.83s -> 9316.47s]  Whoo.
[9316.47s -> 9317.19s]  Don't don't.
[9320.81s -> 9321.13s]  Damn.
[9321.13s -> 9322.25s]  You hit me like seven times.
[9324.33s -> 9328.25s]  That's what I kept missing in the tournament is the Superman is a Superman.
[9340.09s -> 9340.73s]  What the hell?
[9345.70s -> 9348.15s]  Oh, I enjoyed it.
[9350.58s -> 9351.54s]  Did I hit you with that bat?
[9351.54s -> 9352.18s]  That was crazy.
[9352.18s -> 9353.30s]  You were like far away.
[9355.67s -> 9358.50s]  Oh, oh, my God.
[9358.50s -> 9359.22s]  That I'm alive.
[9359.22s -> 9359.70s]  I'm alive.
[9361.93s -> 9362.49s]  Oh, my God.
[9363.05s -> 9366.57s]  I've never seen someone with faster knockback than in that move right there.
[9366.57s -> 9368.33s]  It's so I got deleted.
[9382.20s -> 9384.66s]  Oh, I'm living.
[9388.17s -> 9391.21s]  Oh, I was I was out there to try to kill you in case he didn't.
[9392.89s -> 9394.70s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[9394.70s -> 9395.02s]  I'm dead.
[9397.48s -> 9407.27s]  Oh, so close.
[9408.47s -> 9416.04s]  131.
[9416.04s -> 9416.92s]  Oh, my goodness.
[9418.60s -> 9419.56s]  Oh, my God.
[9419.56s -> 9421.48s]  How did you through the floor?
[9421.48s -> 9423.72s]  Oh, that was unbelievable.
[9423.72s -> 9425.16s]  Did you go in the floor?
[9425.16s -> 9428.12s]  I did the dunk and he was jumping up through the floor.
[9428.12s -> 9428.62s]  Wow.
[9429.32s -> 9431.40s]  As it happened, that was insane.
[9431.40s -> 9432.04s]  I came.
[9432.04s -> 9433.96s]  Yeah, I came up through the tunnel.
[9433.96s -> 9435.70s]  All I do is get kills.
[9435.70s -> 9436.82s]  Was it no damage?
[9437.38s -> 9438.34s]  Hey, that's what you need.
[9438.34s -> 9439.06s]  You need someone.
[9439.86s -> 9442.10s]  You need someone to hold the line or need someone to throw the ball.
[9442.10s -> 9445.14s]  You know, like that was crazy.
[9445.14s -> 9445.64s]  It comes.
[9446.44s -> 9448.08s]  Somebody win this tournament yet.
[9448.08s -> 9448.58s]  What happened?
[9450.24s -> 9451.68s]  It's probably wrapping up.
[9451.68s -> 9452.72s]  I'm not totally sure.
[9454.20s -> 9456.04s]  Now, we're going to take it back up tomorrow.
[9456.04s -> 9461.39s]  I guess they got to review Ludwig and Alpharet together.
[9461.39s -> 9462.03s]  Wait, really?
[9462.59s -> 9464.03s]  I think Stan's at the dip.
[9464.03s -> 9464.59s]  Oh, OK.
[9464.59s -> 9466.67s]  Yeah, Stan said he had to leave at 425.
[9466.67s -> 9467.64s]  That would be it.
[9467.64s -> 9469.96s]  So I'm guessing that they made it to Grands and then playing.
[9469.96s -> 9470.76s]  Oh, shit.
[9470.76s -> 9474.20s]  Yeah, I'll take his money.
[9474.84s -> 9478.94s]  Wouldn't mind.
[9478.94s -> 9480.78s]  He only deserves second place money.
[9480.78s -> 9482.86s]  Even if they win, he doesn't deserve the first place money.
[9484.54s -> 9488.06s]  The amount difference between second and first should go, I don't know, maybe to fourth,
[9488.62s -> 9489.34s]  I guess.
[9489.34s -> 9489.74s]  Right.
[9489.74s -> 9490.94s]  Just go to fourth.
[9490.94s -> 9492.30s]  I'll split it with Tide Fifth either.
[9492.30s -> 9497.05s]  I mean, it should probably play should see at least, you know, 100, 200.
[9497.05s -> 9497.45s]  Maybe.
[9497.45s -> 9498.17s]  Yeah, that's what we were saying.
[9498.17s -> 9500.09s]  We were saying 100, 100 bucks for fourth.
[9500.09s -> 9501.53s]  Ludwig was pretending to not read it.
[9505.10s -> 9507.58s]  Oh, Steven Universe, that person's fucking gone.
[9509.98s -> 9519.40s]  Oh, if I really don't so hard, the ball disappears.
[9521.32s -> 9523.24s]  Oh, crazy.
[9523.24s -> 9524.44s]  It's like that in real life, too.
[9525.16s -> 9527.80s]  They have to bring like 20 balls to the game.
[9529.32s -> 9531.00s]  Actually, there probably is 20 balls in the game.
[9533.07s -> 9535.87s]  Do they go through basketballs like baseball goes through baseballs?
[9535.87s -> 9536.19s]  I think so.
[9536.19s -> 9538.51s]  Or do they use the same ball the whole game?
[9538.51s -> 9538.83s]  I don't.
[9538.83s -> 9540.11s]  That's a great question.
[9540.11s -> 9541.63s]  That's a really good question.
[9541.63s -> 9542.51s]  I feel like no way.
[9542.51s -> 9545.31s]  I feel like basketball probably goes through eight balls for no reason.
[9551.23s -> 9552.75s]  Every dunk, they switch it up.
[9553.47s -> 9555.50s]  No football.
[9555.50s -> 9557.18s]  They switch the ball all the time.
[9557.18s -> 9557.58s]  They do.
[9557.58s -> 9559.42s]  Well, teams get their own balls, too.
[9559.42s -> 9560.70s]  They bring their own balls to the game.
[9560.70s -> 9561.34s]  Yeah.
[9561.34s -> 9563.98s]  Because some pitch, like some quarterbacks like the ball to be
[9564.78s -> 9566.62s]  inflated, really worn out.
[9566.62s -> 9566.86s]  Yeah.
[9566.86s -> 9568.06s]  Really worn out and some like.
[9568.06s -> 9571.18s]  Oh, yeah, they do that in the Super Bowl.
[9583.29s -> 9586.33s]  I need to kill Jerma.
[9586.97s -> 9587.21s]  Yeah.
[9588.17s -> 9588.81s]  Yeah.
[9588.81s -> 9589.21s]  What's up?
[9590.65s -> 9592.81s]  Oh, I thought you said I need to tell Jerma.
[9592.81s -> 9594.01s]  Like, I need to tell you something.
[9594.01s -> 9595.29s]  No, he needs to kill you.
[9595.29s -> 9596.01s]  I need to be honest.
[9597.53s -> 9599.53s]  Everything you've known about me has been a fraud.
[9601.13s -> 9601.77s]  My whole life.
[9603.69s -> 9604.17s]  What are you doing?
[9604.17s -> 9604.73s]  I lost the ball.
[9604.73s -> 9605.29s]  I was chasing it.
[9605.29s -> 9606.33s]  Couldn't get it.
[9606.33s -> 9608.01s]  Doesn't this come back to you?
[9608.01s -> 9612.81s]  I feel like using is a cool thing, which is fine.
[9613.53s -> 9615.12s]  I'm not upset about it.
[9615.12s -> 9616.72s]  LeBron throws the ball to Rhyndag.
[9616.72s -> 9617.60s]  He should say fetch.
[9623.13s -> 9624.09s]  Oh, my goodness.
[9624.97s -> 9626.91s]  You're very high there, Jerma.
[9626.99s -> 9628.35s]  And not just on carrots.
[9629.47s -> 9630.59s]  Getting high on carrots.
[9631.71s -> 9633.39s]  Yeah, I've been like smoking these off here.
[9637.63s -> 9640.33s]  We got to get some kills here.
[9640.33s -> 9640.81s]  I'm going to say.
[9642.01s -> 9643.13s]  Jerma's already dead.
[9645.72s -> 9648.68s]  But I'm also very happy.
[9653.93s -> 9655.21s]  It was just like homing onto you.
[9660.46s -> 9667.85s]  You're cool.
[9667.85s -> 9668.89s]  Loving this.
[9668.89s -> 9669.61s]  Oh, my goodness.
[9670.99s -> 9672.11s]  Oh, there I go.
[9681.02s -> 9681.90s]  Like halfway to kill.
[9689.05s -> 9689.77s]  No, let me go.
[9692.57s -> 9693.93s]  We are very high percent.
[9694.57s -> 9696.38s]  I'm working on it.
[9703.68s -> 9705.84s]  I don't know what happens when we get tied together.
[9708.46s -> 9712.62s]  I think there's like a button that you can press that like leashes him back to you.
[9717.26s -> 9720.22s]  No, I was in the middle of comboing.
[9720.86s -> 9722.30s]  Oh, I could have.
[9722.30s -> 9724.54s]  I probably would have dropped it, but I felt like I could have got it.
[9725.26s -> 9726.94s]  Hey, game three.
[9726.94s -> 9727.10s]  All right.
[9727.10s -> 9728.46s]  This one's for all three.
[9728.46s -> 9730.70s]  Game three thousand dollars.
[9730.70s -> 9731.50s]  This one's for all.
[9731.50s -> 9733.74s]  You had six hundred damage, dude.
[9735.23s -> 9736.75s]  Rhyndag was just kind of hitting everybody.
[9736.75s -> 9737.95s]  Support character, huh?
[9738.75s -> 9740.36s]  Oh, my God.
[9742.59s -> 9745.79s]  Yeah, it looks like you turned on the stream by accident.
[9749.45s -> 9750.25s]  That's how I feel.
[9750.25s -> 9752.97s]  Sometimes I'm like, what does that mean?
[9752.97s -> 9754.41s]  OK, if it's all the marbles.
[9754.41s -> 9756.73s]  It's kind of funny because I know exactly what they mean.
[9758.25s -> 9759.53s]  Like I, I get it.
[9759.53s -> 9760.25s]  I know what you mean.
[9760.25s -> 9762.81s]  Like you're just chilling playing multiverses, you know.
[9762.81s -> 9763.85s]  Yeah, we're just like chilling.
[9764.41s -> 9766.41s]  Yeah, that's that's a sometimes it's like that.
[9766.41s -> 9766.81s]  Whatever.
[9768.01s -> 9769.29s]  That's how streams should feel.
[9769.29s -> 9770.41s]  Ever heard of Clint Stevens?
[9770.41s -> 9773.85s]  Ban that person, ban that person for one full 60 seconds.
[9774.65s -> 9783.12s]  Stop enjoying the game.
[9783.76s -> 9790.78s]  But I like the game.
[9790.78s -> 9794.06s]  That'll teach him.
[9794.06s -> 9796.54s]  Yeah, then VIP them, then ban them again.
[9798.04s -> 9799.80s]  And then put them on stream
[9799.80s -> 9801.80s]  and they can say literally whatever they want for 10 seconds
[9801.80s -> 9803.56s]  and then permanently ban them and then VIP them
[9805.45s -> 9809.68s]  and then permanently ban them.
[9809.68s -> 9811.76s]  You're just tossing them around at this point.
[9811.76s -> 9833.05s]  I really want to just like, you know, fuck with them.
[9833.05s -> 9834.09s]  Trunk on carrots.
[9838.59s -> 9839.07s]  All right.
[9839.07s -> 9840.35s]  This is for the marbles, right?
[9840.35s -> 9842.91s]  Yeah, every last marble.
[9842.91s -> 9845.32s]  Oh, I can't believe that.
[9860.80s -> 9861.44s]  Oh, man.
[9877.87s -> 9878.75s]  Oh, damn it.
[9878.75s -> 9879.31s]  Oh, my God.
[9883.87s -> 9884.27s]  Holy.
[9884.27s -> 9885.31s]  Oh, that killed.
[9885.31s -> 9885.71s]  I did not.
[9885.71s -> 9886.67s]  Holy.
[9886.67s -> 9888.67s]  They're doing pretty good.
[9888.67s -> 9890.00s]  Didn't want to throw the ball.
[9890.72s -> 9893.45s]  Might be a random toy now.
[9895.23s -> 9896.30s]  Maybe not.
[9897.63s -> 9898.59s]  No, he's still very good.
[9903.28s -> 9904.56s]  Oh, it's trying to bounce that back to you.
[9914.80s -> 9916.24s]  Oh, there I go.
[9916.24s -> 9916.88s]  Oh, yeah.
[9916.88s -> 9918.08s]  Oh, my God.
[9918.08s -> 9919.44s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[9923.69s -> 9928.97s]  Okay.
[9928.97s -> 9929.93s]  That was good.
[9929.93s -> 9931.13s]  One for blue.
[9931.13s -> 9933.60s]  This is even though.
[9950.28s -> 9952.60s]  Oh, careful.
[9952.60s -> 9954.76s]  Whoa, let's go.
[9954.76s -> 9955.40s]  Oh, man.
[9957.56s -> 9958.20s]  That's gay.
[9958.20s -> 9959.88s]  I was like, maybe if I'm going off stage,
[9959.88s -> 9961.56s]  it'll bring me out to you.
[9961.56s -> 9965.24s]  And then we get to play in the tournament.
[9965.24s -> 9966.68s]  That would have been exciting.
[9966.68s -> 9968.12s]  That was a good matchup.
[9968.12s -> 9969.40s]  I think it was pretty even.
[9970.52s -> 9972.36s]  Rock with the four kills.
[9972.36s -> 9973.32s]  300 damage.
[9973.32s -> 9975.64s]  You just like I've always had 360.
[9976.44s -> 9977.88s]  Why do we didn't get the best match
[9977.88s -> 9978.76s]  of the day on a stream?
[9978.76s -> 9980.20s]  You know, he didn't.
[9980.20s -> 9982.36s]  That was probably a more entertaining
[9982.36s -> 9984.04s]  two best of three is both more entertaining
[9984.04s -> 9985.08s]  than every set.
[9985.08s -> 9986.44s]  Love a guy today.
[9986.44s -> 9987.18s]  That was a good fight.
[9987.18s -> 9987.98s]  Good match.
[9987.98s -> 9989.34s]  Let's play you guys.
[9989.34s -> 9990.06s]  Oh, that was awesome.
[9990.62s -> 9991.42s]  I had a lot of fun.
[9991.74s -> 9994.72s]  Hey, multiverses.
[9994.72s -> 9995.82s]  Let's do more events.
[9996.54s -> 9997.26s]  More events.
[9997.26s -> 9997.82s]  It's fun.
[9997.82s -> 9998.46s]  More events.
[9998.46s -> 10001.82s]  Weekly Ludwig tournaments until one of us wins.
[10003.34s -> 10003.50s]  Yeah.
[10003.50s -> 10006.40s]  And so we all like get a couple thousand dollars.
[10006.40s -> 10008.96s]  I think all the placements should just make the same.
[10009.76s -> 10010.56s]  I mean, why?
[10010.56s -> 10013.52s]  You know, why word based on how good you did.
[10013.52s -> 10014.72s]  Like that makes people feel bad.
[10015.52s -> 10016.56s]  So let's just, you know.
[10016.56s -> 10018.16s]  Hey, I'm all right being fifth place.
[10018.16s -> 10020.16s]  About eight dollars to fourth and fifth.
[10020.16s -> 10020.96s]  Or four and a half.
[10020.96s -> 10021.52s]  Right.
[10021.52s -> 10022.00s]  Technically.
[10023.20s -> 10023.92s]  Yeah.
[10024.00s -> 10027.20s]  Hey, you guys have good streams.
[10027.20s -> 10027.92s]  I'm out now.
[10027.92s -> 10028.24s]  Yeah.
[10028.24s -> 10028.72s]  All right.
[10028.72s -> 10029.04s]  Yeah.
[10029.04s -> 10029.68s]  Let's play now.
[10029.68s -> 10030.08s]  Run.
[10030.08s -> 10031.04s]  Thanks playing, guys.
[10031.04s -> 10032.40s]  You may be in the next Ludwig event.
[10032.40s -> 10033.28s]  Who knows?
[10033.28s -> 10033.84s]  Yeah.
[10033.84s -> 10035.48s]  Ooh, Fortnite.
[10035.48s -> 10038.65s]  So can I keep playing?
[10039.77s -> 10040.65s]  Is that it for you?
[10040.65s -> 10041.37s]  How do you feel?
[10041.37s -> 10044.72s]  I think I might go play something else a bit soon.
[10044.72s -> 10045.04s]  All right.
[10047.16s -> 10048.32s]  It's been fun, though.
[10048.88s -> 10049.84s]  It has been a good time.
[10051.34s -> 10052.78s]  Hey, we had a good showing.
[10052.78s -> 10053.66s]  I think we did.
[10053.66s -> 10054.54s]  We played pretty well.
[10054.54s -> 10055.74s]  We really did.
[10055.74s -> 10058.14s]  We lost to the two winners finals teams.
[10058.14s -> 10059.50s]  I think grand finals teams.
[10059.50s -> 10061.32s]  So, you know, at the end of the day,
[10061.80s -> 10064.40s]  some are saying we were the best team there.
[10064.40s -> 10065.68s]  Yeah, I say one of the best team.
[10065.68s -> 10069.31s]  We're one of the top eight teams there.
[10069.31s -> 10069.87s]  That is true.
[10069.87s -> 10073.55s]  We were in the top eight.
[10073.55s -> 10075.52s]  Yeah, it's always a pleasure, dude.
[10075.52s -> 10076.16s]  Dude, of course.
[10076.16s -> 10076.72s]  It was fun.
[10076.72s -> 10078.16s]  Have a great rest of your stream.
[10078.16s -> 10079.29s]  Yeah, we'll talk soon.
[10079.29s -> 10080.25s]  I'll see you.
[10080.25s -> 10084.49s]  Take care, dude.
[10084.49s -> 10085.29s]  All right.
[10085.29s -> 10086.25s]  So that's that.
[10086.25s -> 10090.56s]  That was multi-versus tournament.
[10090.56s -> 10091.92s]  Yeah, honestly, we played really well.
[10097.08s -> 10098.92s]  We probably could have been fourth or third.
[10098.92s -> 10099.80s]  We probably could have.
[10099.80s -> 10104.46s]  That was a lot of fun, though.
[10104.46s -> 10106.78s]  It's fun to play a game and be like kind of good at it.
[10106.78s -> 10107.90s]  Like be okay at it.
[10107.90s -> 10111.74s]  Are you going to leave?
[10111.74s -> 10112.76s]  Yes.
[10112.76s -> 10115.40s]  So for those of you that aren't aware,
[10115.40s -> 10120.32s]  I'm still dealing with an obnoxious fucking medical problem
[10120.32s -> 10122.16s]  that it just comes and goes, comes and goes.
[10122.16s -> 10123.28s]  And it's causing me a ton of problems.
[10124.08s -> 10125.04s]  I'm fine.
[10125.04s -> 10127.13s]  But I need, like I said before,
[10127.13s -> 10130.22s]  I want to do more streams this week, but less time.
[10130.22s -> 10131.26s]  And I didn't stream yesterday.
[10131.26s -> 10134.38s]  I wanted to go like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[10134.38s -> 10136.25s]  But we started on Wednesday.
[10136.25s -> 10137.21s]  We're going to do Wednesday.
[10137.21s -> 10140.19s]  Tomorrow, I believe, I'm going to go check and see.
[10140.19s -> 10143.24s]  I think the myth call of duty thing is tomorrow.
[10143.24s -> 10147.39s]  So more networking Andy tomorrow.
[10147.39s -> 10148.80s]  That should be funny.
[10148.80s -> 10151.58s]  Okay, because I played well today.
[10151.58s -> 10155.02s]  I'm going to be the worst fucking player on any team tomorrow.
[10155.02s -> 10156.06s]  It's going to be embarrassing.
[10156.06s -> 10159.04s]  So if you want to watch me make an absolute fool out of myself in call of duty,
[10159.04s -> 10160.16s]  it's not going to be funny.
[10160.16s -> 10165.10s]  It's going to be embarrassing for all of us as a collective entire community.
[10165.10s -> 10166.22s]  So I hope you're ready.
[10167.85s -> 10169.53s]  But if that happens, if that happens,
[10170.09s -> 10172.60s]  it'll be, I might stream my perspective.
[10172.60s -> 10174.28s]  If not, it'll be on Myth's channel on YouTube.
[10175.21s -> 10176.30s]  We'll see.
[10176.30s -> 10180.06s]  But on Friday, we're going to do two point campus.
[10180.06s -> 10183.64s]  And then maybe mortuary assistant.
[10183.64s -> 10185.40s]  And then Sunday is green screen movie night.
[10185.40s -> 10188.44s]  And then Monday, we're doing a hangout stream where we talk about baseball.
[10188.44s -> 10192.59s]  And then obviously baseball is a few days later.
[10192.59s -> 10194.67s]  And then we'll do sorcery when I come back from baseball.
[10194.67s -> 10199.13s]  So we'll see.
[10199.13s -> 10202.48s]  But yeah, I'm trying to not sit here for too long.
[10204.38s -> 10205.98s]  I'll leave out the minute details.
[10205.98s -> 10211.02s]  But there's been annoying things I've had to deal with over the last week or two.
[10211.02s -> 10211.58s]  But I'm all right.
[10211.58s -> 10212.22s]  I'll be fine.
[10212.22s -> 10214.49s]  I'll be good for baseball.
[10214.49s -> 10215.61s]  But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[10215.61s -> 10217.58s]  We'll go for like another three, four hours tomorrow.
[10217.58s -> 10219.50s]  And then Friday will be a little longer.
[10219.50s -> 10221.95s]  Because we're probably going to play two games on Friday.
[10221.95s -> 10224.54s]  Is it the back problem?
[10224.54s -> 10227.20s]  It's a combination of a few things that have just,
[10227.20s -> 10232.48s]  it's just been a thorn in my side for the last two or three weeks.
[10232.48s -> 10233.04s]  But I'm good.
[10233.04s -> 10233.60s]  I'm all right.
[10233.60s -> 10235.12s]  I feel, I feel, I feel okay today.
[10235.12s -> 10235.68s]  Right.
[10235.68s -> 10237.53s]  But I don't want to go too hard.
[10237.53s -> 10241.15s]  But I'll see you tomorrow.
[10241.15s -> 10245.61s]  Keep an eye on what's happening with the Call of Duty thing.
[10245.61s -> 10248.25s]  If there is, if for some reason there is no Call of Duty thing,
[10248.25s -> 10249.69s]  then we'll play something tomorrow.
[10249.69s -> 10250.81s]  We'll do something else.
[10250.81s -> 10252.09s]  So there'll be a stream tomorrow.
[10252.09s -> 10256.14s]  And with that, let's, we'll raid Connor.
[10256.14s -> 10257.18s]  Because we were just playing with Connor.
[10257.18s -> 10262.16s]  I think Connor's still streaming.
[10262.16s -> 10264.04s]  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[10264.04s -> 10266.28s]  Also, obviously thanks to Ludwig for the invite.
[10266.28s -> 10269.23s]  I don't, if they, if they, are they still doing there?
[10269.23s -> 10270.19s]  Is it, is it over?
[10270.19s -> 10273.64s]  I don't know, but that was, that was awesome.
[10273.64s -> 10278.14s]  Thanks for watching, obviously.
[10278.14s -> 10279.55s]  You're around tomorrow?
[10279.55s -> 10282.59s]  You're around tomorrow?
[10282.59s -> 10286.89s]  Either the Mortuary Assistant or Myth's Call of Duty event.
[10286.89s -> 10290.49s]  I'll put a sus command when I figure out everything.
[10290.49s -> 10295.77s]  Yeah, we'll raid Connor.
[10295.77s -> 10305.61s]  Let's go for it.
[10305.61s -> 10306.81s]  I need a horror game.
[10306.81s -> 10310.78s]  The only reason why I wouldn't do the Mortuary Assistant tomorrow
[10310.78s -> 10314.86s]  is if I don't want to be like screaming and tense up and have a problem.
[10314.86s -> 10315.82s]  And then fuck myself up.
[10315.82s -> 10317.02s]  So we'll see tomorrow.
[10317.02s -> 10317.98s]  There will be a stream tomorrow.
[10317.98s -> 10319.34s]  We'll see, we'll see what it is.
[10319.34s -> 10327.84s]  But I'm, we'll wing it.
[10327.84s -> 10333.32s]  Thanks again, guys.
[10333.32s -> 10336.20s]  And here we go, let's raid Connor.
[10336.20s -> 10337.72s]  Whatever Connor is doing.
[10337.72s -> 10341.96s]  Thanks, I wasn't paying too much attention to much
[10341.96s -> 10343.64s]  because I was focusing on obviously trying to win.
[10343.64s -> 10345.84s]  But that was Multi Versus.
[10345.84s -> 10346.64s]  Go get it.
[10346.64s -> 10347.28s]  Go try it.
[10347.28s -> 10348.80s]  The game's free and it's fun.
[10348.80s -> 10350.33s]  That's all that needs to be said about it.
[10350.33s -> 10352.36s]  What time tomorrow?
[10353.16s -> 10354.84s]  Probably around the same time I started today.
[10354.84s -> 10356.68s]  Like probably around two or three o'clock Pacific.
[10356.68s -> 10367.42s]  That was a chill tournament stream.
[10367.42s -> 10371.23s]  Yeah, sometimes you just play games and that's fine.
[10371.79s -> 10376.32s]  You know, I got to prove that I know how to use a controller.
[10376.32s -> 10379.44s]  I got to prove that I don't hold the controller upside down every stream.
[10379.44s -> 10387.61s]  All right.
[10387.61s -> 10388.41s]  Good night, guys.
[10388.41s -> 10389.13s]  See you soon.
[10389.13s -> 10390.62s]  Take care.
[10390.62s -> 10391.34s]  Bye, mother.
[10391.34s -> 10393.10s]  Have a great night.
