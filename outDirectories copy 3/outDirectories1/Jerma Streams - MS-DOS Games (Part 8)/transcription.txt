[4.60s -> 7.54s]  I love this comment, what he said.
[7.54s -> 14.30s]  LOL, he's streaming the entirety of Columbo on his other channel.
[14.30s -> 19.99s]  Why do you know what Columbo is?
[19.99s -> 22.62s]  Why do you know what that is?
[22.62s -> 35.50s]  Do they still play Columbo on like TBS for like 8 hours a day?
[35.50s -> 37.50s]  Do they still do that?
[37.50s -> 48.58s]  I want to know what the royalties and kind of syndication rights that the Columbo producers have.
[48.58s -> 58.33s]  Because Columbo has been I think syndicated and on more networks than Seinfeld and Friends combined.
[58.33s -> 69.00s]  I think there's like a 20% chance that if you change through television channels, you'll land on Columbo.
[69.00s -> 72.37s]  It's still like that. I did not know that.
[72.37s -> 75.25s]  How are you? Good to see you.
[75.25s -> 80.18s]  Things are going well. Give me one sec.
[80.18s -> 93.10s]  Oh, I thought I muted the mic.
[93.10s -> 95.73s]  Holy shit, why did the mic not mute?
[95.73s -> 97.90s]  That button doesn't work.
[97.90s -> 105.02s]  I just like moved my microphone to be closer to my face and I thought I muted it.
[105.02s -> 107.02s]  I usually do. I usually catch that.
[107.02s -> 109.02s]  But this button doesn't work.
[109.02s -> 111.02s]  I'm really sorry. That should not have happened.
[111.02s -> 114.22s]  I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing good.
[114.22s -> 117.49s]  Let me just make a tweet.
[117.49s -> 123.76s]  Ailee streamer?
[123.76s -> 125.76s]  He said, well, why are you 6 hours late?
[125.76s -> 132.29s]  Well, here's the thing.
[132.29s -> 137.28s]  Yesterday, I was supposed to stream at what?
[137.28s -> 139.65s]  Four o'clock yesterday?
[139.65s -> 144.68s]  But what happened was I ended up playing.
[144.68s -> 154.76s]  I delayed the stream by like three or four hours and then played with Ludwig, Charlie and Connor.
[154.76s -> 159.64s]  And then the stream that was supposed to happen yesterday is happening just today.
[159.64s -> 161.94s]  I mean, whatever. Oops, wrong Discord.
[161.94s -> 166.42s]  Whatever.
[166.42s -> 168.42s]  I'm tweeting. I'm tweeting. I'm tweeting. Just wait.
[168.42s -> 169.42s]  I'm tweeting.
[169.42s -> 210.77s]  Oops, wrong Discord.
[210.77s -> 217.10s]  I got the ID wrong.
[217.10s -> 221.38s]  It's whatever.
[221.38s -> 223.38s]  Was that even that bad?
[223.38s -> 225.38s]  OK, the joke wasn't bad. It was the execution.
[225.38s -> 227.81s]  That was the problem.
[227.81s -> 229.81s]  I had great joke writers yesterday.
[229.81s -> 231.81s]  It's just I, as the actor, screwed it up.
[231.81s -> 234.88s]  Right?
[234.88s -> 236.88s]  I'm also the writer too, so don't get mad.
[236.88s -> 243.41s]  That was a good one.
[243.41s -> 246.67s]  It was so bad. It was embarrassing.
[246.67s -> 253.58s]  Was it really though? I don't think so.
[253.58s -> 256.34s]  Pre-written stream.
[256.34s -> 260.34s]  I told you guys this, but I have on my third monitor over here.
[260.34s -> 264.34s]  You notice how sometimes I kind of look over and I'm not looking over at you guys?
[264.34s -> 266.34s]  Like the chat room. I'm looking at the other monitor.
[266.34s -> 271.34s]  I have about six to seven thousand jokes that I have written out as one sentence.
[271.34s -> 274.34s]  Kind of like little references from when I was a kid or whatever.
[274.34s -> 276.34s]  Just here.
[276.34s -> 278.34s]  And I just look over and I pick one.
[278.34s -> 280.58s]  And I just say it.
[280.58s -> 284.58s]  It's a really, really good tip if you're trying to stream to an audience.
[284.58s -> 288.58s]  It's like I have six or seven thousand, kind of one sentence.
[288.58s -> 290.58s]  Like when aliens show up.
[290.58s -> 292.58s]  That kind of shit, right?
[292.58s -> 297.06s]  That's like a sentence here.
[297.06s -> 301.06s]  If I hit control F, find D, and I type Duncan.
[301.06s -> 305.42s]  It's two or three hundred of these lines here.
[305.42s -> 307.42s]  It's like Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan.
[307.42s -> 309.42s]  So it's like pretty much any scenario.
[309.42s -> 311.42s]  I can just do it.
[311.42s -> 313.42s]  It's kind of like an encyclopedia.
[313.42s -> 318.35s]  You guys ready to play MS-DOS?
[318.35s -> 321.42s]  All these cutaway gags.
[321.42s -> 328.72s]  You should do a naked joke.
[328.72s -> 337.55s]  Well, a naked joke turns into a banned joke.
[337.55s -> 339.55s]  I just turn on the full face cam.
[339.55s -> 343.55s]  And just, I just am naked and I just point at the camera and go.
[343.55s -> 344.55s]  Got ya!
[344.55s -> 347.56s]  And then like the not like this image shows up.
[347.56s -> 349.56s]  And my stream's just gone.
[349.56s -> 353.34s]  How is that a joke?
[353.34s -> 365.16s]  Oh ha, that would be funny.
[365.16s -> 366.16s]  It's with you guys.
[366.16s -> 369.62s]  Alright, so we're gonna play MS-DOS.
[369.62s -> 370.62s]  It's returning.
[370.62s -> 372.62s]  It's been a long time since I've played it.
[372.62s -> 375.62s]  The last MS-DOS stream I believe was probably like two years ago.
[375.62s -> 379.26s]  It's been a very long time.
[379.26s -> 381.26s]  It's been like at least a year or two.
[381.26s -> 384.27s]  I used to do this once a week.
[384.27s -> 390.96s]  Because there are probably a thousand plus MS-DOS pieces of software.
[390.96s -> 397.55s]  So we're gonna play.
[397.55s -> 402.99s]  This is how we're gonna do it.
[402.99s -> 405.99s]  The first one is gonna be a big fan favorite I think.
[405.99s -> 414.84s]  One of the most requested DOS games that I've received since saying I was gonna go back to this.
[414.84s -> 418.17s]  No, not Wolfenstein.
[418.17s -> 420.37s]  Nope.
[420.37s -> 422.37s]  No, we're talking about Jump Start Kindergarten.
[422.37s -> 429.30s]  That's the one that's been requested a lot.
[429.30s -> 438.31s]  I was told that the music in this game is the only reason to play it.
[438.31s -> 441.77s]  But we're gonna find out what that means.
[441.77s -> 444.46s]  Finally, a game fitting for chat.
[444.46s -> 448.10s]  I wonder how excited...
[448.10s -> 449.10s]  Okay, this is...
[449.10s -> 452.10s]  If you guys resident sleeper this game, I'm gonna be real pissed.
[452.10s -> 454.79s]  I'm gonna be very unhappy if this is like,
[454.79s -> 460.30s]  Ah dude, next, hurry up.
[460.30s -> 466.37s]  Everybody pretend Pogs until the thing that they pretend Pogging actually shows up.
[466.37s -> 475.84s]  I've learned this over the years.
[475.84s -> 477.84s]  I, you know, I get Pog-lit all the time.
[477.84s -> 479.84s]  You guys are just Pog-lighting me a lot.
[479.84s -> 480.84s]  Oh my god, you didn't...
[480.84s -> 482.84s]  No, dude, you gotta do Pog.
[482.84s -> 484.84s]  Pogchamp, oh my god, Pog.
[484.84s -> 485.84s]  He's gonna do it.
[485.84s -> 488.66s]  And then I do it.
[488.66s -> 489.66s]  This fucking sucks, dude.
[489.66s -> 490.66s]  Fucking do something else.
[490.66s -> 492.66s]  I would rather you play Picross, dude.
[492.66s -> 493.66s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[493.66s -> 494.66s]  Fucking turn your stream off.
[494.66s -> 499.16s]  Alright, here we go.
[499.16s -> 501.16s]  Jump Start Kindergarten number one is the first one we're gonna do.
[501.16s -> 502.16s]  Let's do it.
[502.16s -> 507.33s]  You guys ready?
[507.33s -> 508.33s]  Are you?
[508.33s -> 511.87s]  I know.
[511.87s -> 526.27s]  Alright, it's so far so good.
[526.27s -> 532.40s]  That we're at school.
[537.66s -> 538.66s]  This is the song.
[538.66s -> 548.67s]  This is the song here?
[548.67s -> 549.67s]  This is crazy.
[549.67s -> 556.71s]  I love the tuba.
[556.71s -> 559.55s]  What about the garden?
[559.55s -> 562.18s]  Can I go to the garden?
[562.18s -> 563.18s]  Everything is clickable.
[563.18s -> 566.18s]  This was huge back in the fucking forties.
[566.18s -> 568.61s]  Everything was clickable.
[568.61s -> 569.61s]  Yup, you didn't...
[569.61s -> 571.61s]  Oh, Gerber, you can't click on the tree and have oranges spawn.
[571.61s -> 573.61s]  What are you, fucking dumb?
[573.61s -> 582.66s]  Whoa!
[582.66s -> 584.09s]  Whoa!
[584.09s -> 587.93s]  I need to do these streams more often.
[587.93s -> 589.93s]  This is really easy content.
[589.93s -> 598.18s]  Do you guys see?
[598.18s -> 600.18s]  Oh, they're on a swing.
[600.18s -> 610.55s]  Oh, and he's not getting pog-lighted.
[610.55s -> 612.55s]  No, I'm not this time.
[612.55s -> 613.55s]  Alright, let's go.
[613.55s -> 614.55s]  Let's get it.
[614.55s -> 617.01s]  There's a note.
[617.01s -> 618.44s]  What does the note say?
[618.44s -> 622.06s]  Type each letter of your name on the keyboard.
[622.06s -> 625.30s]  Click on the doorknob when you're done.
[625.30s -> 630.00s]  That's great.
[630.00s -> 635.82s]  I bet you it's the same person that did every single voice in the whole game.
[635.82s -> 641.53s]  You want to talk about, like, compassionate game devs?
[641.53s -> 644.02s]  This is the programmer.
[644.02s -> 646.02s]  This is the voice actor.
[646.02s -> 648.02s]  This is the guy that made all the puzzles.
[648.02s -> 651.67s]  One man show, truly.
[651.67s -> 660.74s]  Um, Anthony.
[660.74s -> 670.50s]  Good afternoon.
[670.50s -> 671.50s]  Hey.
[671.50s -> 673.50s]  I'm Mr. Hopsalot, your teacher.
[673.50s -> 674.74s]  What?

[692.43s -> 693.43s]  No.
[693.43s -> 694.43s]  I don't want to.
[694.43s -> 695.43s]  No.

[812.08s -> 817.16s]  Great job.
[817.16s -> 818.16s]  Click on the puzzle.
[818.16s -> 819.34s]  Who is that?
[819.34s -> 820.34s]  Again.
[820.34s -> 821.34s]  No, I don't want to play again.
[821.34s -> 822.34s]  I want to do something else.
[822.34s -> 824.34s]  Let's learn about letters.
[824.34s -> 826.34s]  No, I want to get out of here.
[826.34s -> 827.34s]  I don't want to be here.
[827.34s -> 830.34s]  Find the box that has the letter H.
[830.34s -> 831.51s]  What?
[831.51s -> 832.51s]  No.
[832.51s -> 833.51s]  How do I leave?
[833.51s -> 836.51s]  Find the box that has the letter H.
[836.51s -> 837.51s]  How do I get out of here?
[837.51s -> 840.82s]  Click on the type of puzzle that you want to try.
[840.82s -> 841.82s]  Oh, I want to get out.
[841.82s -> 842.82s]  Arrow in the corner?
[842.82s -> 843.82s]  Okay.
[843.82s -> 844.82s]  Let's go.
[844.82s -> 846.38s]  Find the box that-
[846.38s -> 847.38s]  I don't want to do that.
[847.38s -> 851.37s]  I want to do this other stuff.
[851.37s -> 852.37s]  What does this thing do?
[852.37s -> 855.72s]  Is this a drawing game?
[855.72s -> 858.79s]  I hope it's a drawing game.
[858.79s -> 862.22s]  Listen carefully to the sentence I'm about to say.
[862.22s -> 866.22s]  Then choose the pictures on the chalkboard that go with the sentence.
[866.22s -> 869.91s]  Click on me to repeat the sentence.
[869.91s -> 870.91s]  Okay.
[870.91s -> 880.58s]  I don't know who is the teacher.
[880.58s -> 886.37s]  How am I supposed to know who the teacher is?
[886.37s -> 887.37s]  My teacher.
[887.37s -> 888.37s]  Couldn't these all be a teacher?
[888.37s -> 890.82s]  Say it again.
[890.82s -> 892.00s]  Okay.
[892.00s -> 893.00s]  My-
[893.00s -> 894.00s]  Who is the teacher?
[894.00s -> 895.00s]  The one with the glasses?
[895.00s -> 896.00s]  Was it played?
[896.00s -> 897.00s]  Well, this is stepping on a bug.
[898.00s -> 900.97s]  Who is the teacher?
[900.97s -> 901.97s]  The one with the glasses?
[901.97s -> 902.97s]  Was it played?
[902.97s -> 904.21s]  Well, this is stepping on a bug.
[904.21s -> 909.48s]  Is this it?
[909.48s -> 910.85s]  An ugly?
[910.85s -> 911.85s]  Who's ugly?
[911.85s -> 914.37s]  They're kind of all ugly.
[914.37s -> 915.93s]  It's going to be like the witch, right?
[915.93s -> 919.34s]  Is this a sheep?
[920.34s -> 947.98s]  Alright that was fun.
[947.98s -> 956.33s]  He hates this.
[956.33s -> 966.35s]  The music is fucking awesome.
[966.35s -> 978.64s]  hates this I like the light the music is fucking awesome next game not no you don't by the way

[2608.27s -> 2623.71s]  or something this is weird that's it this would scare the shit out of me when i was a kid because
[2623.71s -> 2639.76s]  this is real where is this from animatronic animals especially animatronic dinosaurs are
[2639.76s -> 2648.67s]  terrifying even to this day to this day going on that was that that like jurassic park ride with
[2648.67s -> 2654.35s]  the t-rex where you go down and the t-rex's huge animatronic head is just right there
[2656.10s -> 2662.66s]  that's something so unsettling about that even in my 30s i just i don't like it i do not like it
[2665.97s -> 2691.79s]  i'm very curious where this footage is from is that what a dinosaur sounds like
[2692.27s -> 2701.76s]  they're anisora i'll repeat we've already seen it all right what are the other activities
[2702.40s -> 2709.33s]  these are not animatronics what the hell are they then what are you talking about all right
[2709.33s -> 2715.57s]  how about a read a dinosaur storybook long long ago animals called dinosaurs lived on the earth
[2715.57s -> 2739.28s]  there were big ones small dry ones some flew in the sky
[2739.28s -> 2749.81s]  this is like this is like somebody's backyard this looks like pine trees back here this is
[2749.81s -> 2757.02s]  somebody's backyard that these were these these wouldn't exist they're like a regular ass pine
[2757.02s -> 2774.03s]  tree exists like a hundred million years ago grass didn't exist no but i mean like a like a regular
[2774.03s -> 2781.87s]  like backyard pine tree i did they with i don't think they existed it was like weird alien stuff
[2782.11s -> 2793.62s]  it was big like tropical plants but did they exist weren't they they have like the huge leaves
[2795.12s -> 2799.76s]  all the jurassic plants were like gigantic lettuce leaves i don't think they were just
[2799.76s -> 2815.50s]  like maple trees hanging out where did they go well we don't know but some people think comets
[2825.94s -> 2837.84s]  like sad quite a way to end the uh presentation all right namosaurus find the brontosaurus
[2837.84s -> 2843.82s]  easy brontosaurus long neck keep looking this is the brachiosaurus
[2850.19s -> 2855.74s]  that's bullshit because you can't see the whole body tyrannosaurus is this one
[2855.74s -> 2872.90s]  keep looking this is the this is t-rex that one you're right way too dank i'll turn it down
[2872.90s -> 2885.04s]  i don't want to find any of these anymore all right hold on what about this one oh shit okay
[2885.04s -> 2898.48s]  that hurts my head hold on a second so this one we have to we can go away pretty much anywhere we
[2898.48s -> 2905.68s]  want 2 000 wait all right let's see if there's any pine trees 100 million years ago brachiosaurus
[2905.68s -> 2918.10s]  what was like a million years ago i'm a genius million bc what about like do they have like
[2918.10s -> 2933.20s]  what do we know was here 2000 1922 to 1925 and we'll do a hundred million miles or something
[2933.20s -> 2948.16s]  100 miles oh pine tree lore yeah we gotta find out what the first pine tree was planted
[2948.16s -> 2966.93s]  there you go 100 million bc is that a but that's not a pine is it a pine tree pine trees some of
[2966.93s -> 2973.60s]  the earliest versions of trees pine trees came before but doesn't that seem odd though i can't
[2973.60s -> 2979.14s]  imagine like a tyrannosaurus rex just walking around a bunch of pine trees that feels weird
[2979.22s -> 2990.14s]  doesn't it don't you like imagine just like a like a baseball diamond near them too
[2990.94s -> 3001.52s]  like at some old like town park like this feels like a weird image like this is just oh yeah
[3001.52s -> 3017.25s]  they're just flying around like back there american education pine trees were the first types of no
[3017.25s -> 3027.33s]  it's not it's not na education it's na education and then 20 years to forget everything it's na
[3027.33s -> 3035.81s]  education and then on top of that whoa 20 years have gone by so i don't know that a pine tree
[3035.81s -> 3052.24s]  existed what was the first bug is what i want to know what was the first bug holy shit life how did
[3052.24s -> 3060.40s]  it happen okay in this illustration you can follow what might be the history of life on earth in the
[3060.40s -> 3065.76s]  sky you see the development of galaxies similar to the milky way there are the comets planets and
[3065.76s -> 3072.86s]  moons that formed in the solar system and the rays of our star the sun send us the energy that
[3072.86s -> 3078.78s]  life depends on in the ocean at the far left the molecules that were the original building blocks
[3078.78s -> 3083.50s]  of life are forming as you look to the right you can see the bacteria that were the first cells
[3083.50s -> 3090.35s]  of life followed by more sophisticated sea life amphibians were able to how they know this how do
[3090.35s -> 3094.43s]  you how do you fucking know any of this is real how do they know any of this you weren't there 150
[3094.43s -> 3103.54s]  billion years ago how do you know this this is the story about how what what fossils show us
[3103.54s -> 3110.43s]  how do you know that what's oxygen huh what's oxygen what is it what is oxygen what is it
[3111.07s -> 3131.42s]  oh it's molecules what's a molecule see got him somebody said bro i was there i know that is not

[5242.62s -> 5249.15s]  news by driving down the value of a4 stock trading of a4 shares was halted in london and
[5249.31s -> 5256.85s]  this is my company as prices declined 18 percent in a matter of hours transacting printer on a
[5256.85s -> 5265.41s]  worldwide scale a4 has risen classified documents tokyo paris berlin rome london dominating such
[5265.41s -> 5273.09s]  diverse fields as silicon chip manufacturing telecommunications and agro technology our
[5273.09s -> 5277.25s]  latest i don't think you want to put those on your desktop the phone from betola hello steve
[5278.26s -> 5284.34s]  in 1974 marotta the japanese president of the a4 group disappeared from his private yacht in the

[5291.22s -> 5295.86s]  last contact with the toronto control tower at about eight o'clock last night while flying over
[5295.86s -> 5301.78s]  the town of totovo 50 kilometers from the serbian border the scotchi government says it has no
[5301.78s -> 5306.02s]  information about the disappearance of the businessman's jet and has sent several rescue
[5306.02s -> 5310.66s]  teams to the area the extreme tension in the balkans together with the bad weather conditions
[5310.66s -> 5315.46s]  which have hit this mountain area for the last week is making the search extremely difficult
[5315.46s -> 5322.08s]  i wonder i want to see what's in like these classified files at first light okay nearly
[5322.08s -> 5330.08s]  25 years ago dwight owen barnes grasped control of the then modest 10 billion dollar a4 group
[5330.08s -> 5335.92s]  turn it into today's 100 billion dollar multinational conglomerate what do we do barnes
[5335.92s -> 5341.04s]  disappearance creates a vacuum in the executive ranks of one of the world's largest and most
[5341.04s -> 5348.00s]  visible what do we sell three former ceos have also departed in an equally abrupt and mysterious
[5348.00s -> 5354.56s]  fashion perhaps even more uncommon is the fact that within a short period a new ceo has been
[5354.56s -> 5360.56s]  named to head a four a complete unknown from outside the organization or from just watching
[5360.56s -> 5367.76s]  the news corporate entity for that matter then a4 usually follows a series of management reversals
[5367.76s -> 5373.44s]  resulting in international market shifts of global proportions out of which the company
[5375.98s -> 5381.02s]  cnn will monitor world financial markets and provide updates as more information becomes
[5381.34s -> 5384.78s]  why do i have access to this guy's computer via cnn online

[5418.75s -> 5429.02s]  world has learned of my absence and may soon learn of my successor it amuses me to hear the
[5429.02s -> 5436.98s]  pundits speculating about the circumstances of our succession policy it gets some better lighting
[5436.98s -> 5444.62s]  your fucking office sucks at a4 we trust in the element of surprise imagine any other company
[5444.62s -> 5450.06s]  stepping outside their cozy network of corporate sycophants and placing a rank amateur at the top
[5450.70s -> 5456.94s]  so your plane didn't pay for his dividend from such timid corporate myopia is the factor of
[5456.94s -> 5462.54s]  complete predictability you see by the time our competitors clones root their way to the front
[5462.54s -> 5469.66s]  of the trough we can anticipate their every move we know every corporate report they've ever
[5469.66s -> 5476.94s]  published every guru they've ever quoted and everyone they've ever you see we got my son's

[5488.30s -> 5494.27s]  possesses genetic instinct and vision to shock the competition that's how we stay on the cutting
[5494.27s -> 5505.62s]  edge so what am i supposed to do 25 years ago i was that individual he set this camera up he's
[5505.62s -> 5511.25s]  sitting here alone even i may have become too predictable so we've devised how many takes do

[5531.44s -> 5540.38s]  my mysterious disappearance a classic red herring and a bit of coincidental timing i find myself in
[5540.38s -> 5547.55s]  a position where's he gonna go i must drive down the value of a4 so one of our best hackers

[6779.50s -> 6784.06s]  furry and what is a furry a werewolf is not a furry but we already went over that and i
[6784.06s -> 6800.22s]  will defend it i will defend it forever where no it is not a werewolf is not a furry no it's not

[6822.08s -> 6828.88s]  class that is like just a snarling beast that turns into this and is on all fours that is not
[6828.88s -> 6836.83s]  a furry that's a werewolf it's not a furry it's not furry adjacent no it's not it's an animal it's
[6836.83s -> 6849.68s]  a beast no it's not a furry it's a beast it's a beast not a furry like if you okay if my werewolf
[6849.68s -> 6856.72s]  character were to stand up on two feet and have glasses and like a school notebook and going like

[6868.77s -> 6886.29s]  have like a like a suit on i'm an beast i'm not a furry i wonder which way i gotta go oh maybe this
[6886.29s -> 6900.93s]  way oh okay there's a key over there that's not a weak argument no it's not if if i look outside
[6900.93s -> 6908.96s]  and there's a moon out there and i am a human and it's like oh not the no the moon and i go off

[7009.89s -> 7027.92s]  with that one okay all right is the dog that talks like this in all those cartoons the one
[7027.92s -> 7050.67s]  that's always looking after jerry is that a furry or is that a dog that can talk is this
[7050.67s -> 7068.00s]  spongebob a furry i don't know man i don't know not enough human characteristics okay
[7068.56s -> 7077.65s]  so garfield's not a furry garfield tom jerry excuse me that means hold on does that mean that

[12698.75s -> 12709.31s]  vendor and you hid inside the box you hid inside the box and then when we poured the strawberries
[12709.31s -> 12718.90s]  into the pot yeah the pot when you were inside you gobbled everything up and didn't leave anything
[12718.90s -> 12734.34s]  for anyone else not even a drop that sounds like joey joey and louie let me be careful those two
[12734.34s -> 12740.02s]  never reveal to anyone what they put in the pot in order to make the sugar coating i don't believe

[12811.97s -> 12816.69s]  so the big magic wand that's on top of the table so it's the small magic wand that's on top of the
[12816.69s -> 12831.18s]  table it's the opposite this is marvelous ronnie we didn't let those two showoffs get the better
[12831.18s -> 12841.12s]  of us put the big jar of honey that is on the table into the pot big jar of honey that's on

[12903.15s -> 12908.98s]  is outside the cupboard into the pot so the big jar of honey that's inside the cupboard
[12909.70s -> 12918.93s]  a small i need a small jar that's inside the cupboard no no i don't want this is a honey jar
[12920.66s -> 12924.42s]  that that's a honey jar in every single video game this is not a honey jar
[12925.70s -> 12928.42s]  no it's not that's not a honey jar in every no
[12932.83s -> 12940.03s]  he's discovered the secret it's the sugar cube that is outside the cupboard into the pot

[18569.04s -> 18585.90s]  i can't click these oh i got it strawberry you amaze me more with every passing second
[18585.90s -> 18591.34s]  i'm beginning to believe that the little red sweet strawberries have magic talents still
[18591.34s -> 18598.70s]  undeveloped of course but still worthy of admiration oh i'm so hungry i was in the box for such a long
[18598.78s -> 18604.78s]  time the let's play open if you get something to eat oh how about a magical lollipop we
[18604.78s -> 18618.82s]  strawberries are red and sweet try to eat sir i i only eat special dishes very special even
[18618.82s -> 18628.61s]  exceptional is that salmon or a hamburger or what do you eat what do you want in my wall
[18628.61s -> 18632.45s]  it's four different colors and then i will eat the hamburger that pops out of the fridge
[18632.45s -> 18648.40s]  this is the pantry go in there okay wait he eats strawberries this is a big plan for me to get
[18648.40s -> 18686.30s]  beaten what the hell is that jesus yeah sheesh sheesh the heck was that strawberry all of the dishes
[18686.30s -> 18694.86s]  here look very ordinary and the magician wants the most exceptional food here help me there are four
[18694.86s -> 18700.06s]  kinds of food on each shelf one of them does not belong to the group and is therefore exceptional
[18700.06s -> 18704.86s]  okay so i have to find it out of there and put it on the top shelf that wants a weird dish he
[18704.86s -> 18714.62s]  wants okay so what doesn't belong here you want a cake um that's right cake is the exception
[18714.62s -> 18719.34s]  since it is a baked product not like grapes the pear and the apple which are fruit
[18720.62s -> 18729.18s]  it's why i picked it thanks for the input all right this is chocolate loaf of bread candy and
[18729.50s -> 18736.29s]  it's a loaf of bread doesn't belong it's not candy that's right bread is the exception since
[18736.29s -> 18745.06s]  it is a baked product not like ice cream chocolate and candy which are sweets make me a cake sandwich
[18746.02s -> 18758.19s]  i don't know what is this milk a donut that's right donut is the exception since it is a bakery
[18758.19s -> 18767.66s]  product and not like yogurt milk and cheese which are milk products okay so we have carrot
[18767.66s -> 18775.28s]  see these all look like it's a bit of banana because it's a fruit that's right banana is
[18775.28s -> 18780.72s]  the exception because it is a fruit and the tomato the carrot and the cucumber are all
[18780.72s -> 18790.37s]  vegetables this guy's deficient in a lot of stuff okay so i did it cake is not the exception since
[18790.37s -> 18803.97s]  it is a baked product like bread what the fuck are you talking about that's right the banana
[18803.97s -> 18810.61s]  is the exception since it is a fruit and all the others are bakery products i don't believe this
[18810.61s -> 18818.77s]  all he wanted to eat was a banana why didn't he just tell us he wanted a banana oh i like this guy
[18818.77s -> 18822.93s]  i know
[18836.32s -> 18860.30s]  right all these banana haters bring me the exceptional dish here this is just what i
[18860.30s -> 18866.38s]  wanted to eat you know now that i've calmed down a little i can tell you the magic didn't work
[18866.38s -> 18871.90s]  perhaps because whenever i do something really big and important i have to put on my great
[18871.90s -> 18877.74s]  magician's hat got it unfortunately that has disappeared someone who wanted to be as great
[18877.74s -> 18883.34s]  as i stole it from me i'm sure that it was one of the pupils in the magician's school oh well
[18883.34s -> 18888.78s]  never mind the police are taking care of the matter and i forgot there are police in the universe
[18888.78s -> 18894.46s]  listen strawberry take this note and bring me some vegetables from the magic vegetable garden
[18894.46s -> 18900.30s]  why when the gardener sees the note he'll let you in you know what if you bring me vegetables
[18900.30s -> 18906.06s]  from the garden and help me find my hat maybe i'll be able to help you get a little closer to the
[18906.06s -> 18912.30s]  three items of magic need vegetables by the way why don't you go up the steps and meet my beautiful
[18912.30s -> 18924.56s]  daughter abretta i'll go for a little walk outside i have your hat oh okay

[19899.50s -> 19906.06s]  abra does not know the magic of the pink turnip and my specialty is in the magic of release
[19906.78s -> 19913.02s]  so it's a good thing you've come to me all the items in this room can put together the magic
[19913.02s -> 19919.50s]  to release an item however in order to know what items are needed for the pink turnip
[19919.50s -> 19925.50s]  i have to close my eyes and dream the items will soon appear in my dream
[19925.66s -> 19932.30s]  you can help me by looking into my dream and try to remember the items that appeared in it
[19933.26s -> 19940.94s]  then bring them to me from the cubby holes on the wall this must be the dream i've been sitting on
[19940.94s -> 19945.34s]  my balls for a long time and i just realized it if you get that if you figure that out
[19946.54s -> 19949.84s]  like i've been sitting on my balls and like i just figured it out right now
[19950.00s -> 19959.95s]  figure it out right now what was it i i wasn't paying any attention

[20196.96s -> 20204.51s]  all right it's a mature audience stream you had to click the thing
[20205.31s -> 20216.24s]  we might be playing a game for seven-year-olds but it's uh it's a mature stream all right put
[20216.24s -> 20225.42s]  the disc in let's go work is magic and magic's work too this is well known to me and to you
[20227.44s -> 20237.15s]  hmm the door has opened let's go hmm i'll just finish end game and we'll fly over the deep dark pit
[20238.27s -> 20254.80s]  is this a cvd stream no i don't i don't look i have i stopped taking tbd teach to you on stream
[20257.12s -> 20261.86s]  in like a year and a half now i've said that like a bunch of times i'm just gonna lie but it's not
[20261.86s -> 20275.58s]  okay the door to the cave is closed i'll go and take a closer look nice this is it
[20276.62s -> 20284.72s]  this is it this is the end here this is the end firefly fairy lives in the dark she doesn't like
[20284.72s -> 20290.32s]  the light only special magic will open the cave what do you think i got in my pocket right here
[20291.28s -> 20292.72s]  ice bingo
[20299.44s -> 20303.44s]  are you guys ready we're gonna see the end of the game and discover the fairy's secret
[20304.40s -> 20314.61s]  how many days have gone by since i've been here my parents have to be looking for me
[20314.61s -> 20320.85s]  the fairy doesn't like the light and doesn't like visitors that's why she hides but when a
[20320.93s -> 20326.69s]  visitor does come she comes out disguised as a firefly and she always has some real
[20326.69s -> 20332.77s]  fireflies around her to light up the cave the secret is that the fairy's light is not
[20332.77s -> 20341.49s]  steady and as soon as she comes out it blinks for a few seconds pay careful attention ronnie
[20341.49s -> 20346.61s]  when the group of fireflies come out you have to direct your attention to the one whose light
[20346.61s -> 20351.25s]  blinks you must then follow her and catch her if you succeed
[20354.05s -> 20380.30s]  slave radigan's theme that one's blinking here she is appearing before my very eyes
[20381.10s -> 20393.65s]  how beautiful regal she is oh god oh brave ronnie i'm so pleased that you tried so hard to meet me
[20394.45s -> 20398.61s]  you are a very special boy and you have a brilliant future ahead of you
[20399.73s -> 20411.18s]  hello to you too firefly fairy you you know that that i'm ronnie of course i've been waiting for
[20411.18s -> 20417.02s]  your visit for quite some time as a matter of fact ever since you arrived in magic land

[20523.46s -> 20537.20s]  and we're ending the game nobody knows what you're saying the other do i said we're gonna
[20537.76s -> 20542.82s]  at the end of the game it's like oh you were like in this weird limbo area and you're gonna
[20542.82s -> 20548.66s]  come out of the birth canal that's what every game right that's that's what every game is yes
[20548.66s -> 20560.00s]  the birth canal every game with a complicated ending is always like oh you're gonna wake up
[20560.00s -> 20582.06s]  you can open your eyes you're gonna be coming out of the birth canal why is he so weird it's not
[20582.06s -> 20588.83s]  i'm just i an elden ring oh at the end of the game yeah you're gonna wake up it's gonna be
[20588.83s -> 20592.83s]  gonna be you're gonna get out of like limbo you're gonna like be reborn right that's the
[20592.83s -> 20604.06s]  that's the joke i'm not speaking to that joke anymore he's high he's high as fuck i'm not
[20604.06s -> 20619.41s]  everybody's relaxed right now or i'll end stream where am i going dude have i done that like three
[20619.41s -> 20632.30s]  times tonight i feel like i have one of these days i'm gonna play a game i'm telling you it's
[20632.30s -> 20639.14s]  gonna be an elaborate big elaborate ending and it's gonna be being like reborn or something
[20650.00s -> 20654.96s]  you've never done the birth canal yes i have oh my god you're out of your mind i do it every
[20654.96s -> 20663.39s]  other game your will to find the magic was strong enough to let you succeed in the difficult tasks
[20663.39s -> 20668.03s]  you were given i can reveal to you the real secret of magic
[20675.17s -> 20681.73s]  listen to me ronnie and i can tell you that i know you are runny yes you did find magic but
[20681.73s -> 20687.49s]  that is just a magic trick it is an illusion where the audience thinks that you have performed magic
[20687.49s -> 20694.46s]  when really you have only been quick with your hands this is what rabbit owner the magician did
[20695.02s -> 20700.46s]  but what he does is not real magic the secret of real magic is in this book
[20700.46s -> 20706.06s]  and i will reveal it to you strawberry you had better listen to although i think that
[20706.06s -> 20713.58s]  you already understand most of the secret as you have already seen work and commitments are the
[20713.58s -> 20720.06s]  magic when we want something very very much we sometimes think that what we want is magic
[20720.06s -> 20724.62s]  but if we work hard and keep at it we will always reach the magic
[20726.00s -> 20732.61s]  magic land is for this you saw for yourselves you have seen that you cannot be a good magician
[20732.61s -> 20738.37s]  without studying in school to gain the knowledge that will allow you to invent things
[20740.45s -> 20748.19s]  magic is just reading books like the train designer does every kind of work has its own
[20748.19s -> 20754.83s]  special magic you've seen that with the artist the carpenter the porter and the vegetables
[20756.05s -> 20759.33s]  vegetables and magic i agree i actually agree with that it's weird
[20761.34s -> 20764.46s]  you put this little tiny little seed in the ground and it fucking expands in the ground
[20764.46s -> 20772.00s]  into an edible thing that you cannot that someone else gave you it's a fact only she could get the
[20772.00s -> 20777.68s]  magic out of the turnip you brought her you most certainly learned that you cannot steal knowledge
[20777.68s -> 20788.38s]  and use it like the student in the magician school tried to do seeing that every goal we hope to
[20788.38s -> 20796.14s]  reach is magic that requires hard work you even have to work hard to gain love that's right isn't
[20796.14s -> 20802.22s]  it strawberry but you're just using magic as to win my daughter's love i am happy that magic land
[20802.22s -> 20808.86s]  was able to teach you what we already know that's just a made-up word understand how to get magic and
[20808.86s -> 20814.14s]  use it correctly even if you are faced with several kinds of magic that your will wants
[20814.14s -> 20821.42s]  to achieve be able to choose the best magic among them for you this every noun the firefly fairy
[20821.42s -> 20828.90s]  have to be afraid even if you think that a deep dark pit separates you from your magic when you
[20828.90s -> 20833.14s]  went to the carpenter and he performed magic with the hammer hitting the nail when you went to the
[20833.22s -> 20837.70s]  chef and he performed his magic making the food that's not how it works
[20838.58s -> 20844.82s]  and get it as the vegetables did and succeeded in getting their own magic remember this too
[20845.46s -> 20851.86s]  even when things get tough you must never take the easy and short path of stealing magic like
[20851.86s -> 20864.86s]  exactly what you're doing the easy path of explaining to a child with me that everything is magic all
[20864.86s -> 20881.68s]  magic come back home even if it is hard for you we understand make no mistake we love you and
[20881.68s -> 20891.52s]  will help you will be so different going back to magic land now that everybody loves me
[20892.48s -> 20900.80s]  i want i also want to find my real goal i find the magic but just a moment i want to say goodbye
[20900.80s -> 20912.70s]  to ronnie wait he knows but they always knew that you were not me and yet they helped us
[20913.66s -> 20921.33s]  i'm going back i'm going back energy my task is to find my magic and become the best magician in
[20921.33s -> 20930.29s]  the world i'm sure you'll succeed thank you for all your help i'll miss you strawberry oh
[20931.25s -> 20937.33s]  and fortunately for you ronnie that was a real spell you're not going anywhere
[20937.33s -> 20957.79s]  you're permanently a tomato i'm not going anywhere oh here we go with the talent show this is it
[20972.11s -> 20979.30s]  what what the fuck wait they were like living carrots in the real world isn't that kind of
[20979.30s -> 20986.54s]  weird no one's asking a question of like where did all these like weird like mutated fruits and
[20986.54s -> 21021.39s]  vegetables come from this is his heart the whole time oh shit he took too much the crowd was amazed
[21021.39s -> 21026.83s]  and we're all wondering where did ronnie learn such wonderful magic but only ronnie and strawberry
[21026.83s -> 21041.26s]  knew the real magic they learned was not the one shown on stage what does that say i'm not back at
[21041.26s -> 21052.45s]  the school i i'm not at the school i didn't go back home i'm in magic world still i never went
[21052.45s -> 21081.82s]  back home that's swedish that was i liked that a lot that was cute the real magic was magic was
[21081.82s -> 21091.81s]  just replaced as a verb or what a noun for hard work but then i actually like floated a thing and
[21091.81s -> 21098.42s]  they made a magical explosion and it floated up i would try got turned into a strawberry magic was
[21098.42s -> 21106.58s]  real how would i become a strawberry i'm telling you we just need to wait a few more minutes here
[21107.65s -> 21131.97s]  and then the birth canal ending happens you're gonna come on press enter i don't think that
[21131.97s -> 21137.31s]  did anything yeah it doesn't do anything now that's it i got to the end of the disk
[21137.95s -> 21158.64s]  there's a sequel is there actually a sequel no there's not really strawberry magic there is
[21158.64s -> 21166.69s]  a sequel oh i'm definitely gonna play that at some point uh i think that's probably a good time to
[21166.69s -> 21176.29s]  end it there's an episode two of strawberry magic i'm definitely gonna play the sequel it was 11
[21176.29s -> 21188.80s]  o'clock i think this is a good place to probably stop for now i actually liked that a lot that was
[21188.80s -> 21194.86s]  really fun some of these old games are just so weird they just need to be experienced when are
[21194.86s -> 21206.13s]  we gonna come out of them what about yeah tonka construction i did not realize it's not dos game
[21206.85s -> 21213.26s]  there's a windows 3.1 game i need a virtual machine to play it so i'm gonna need to get that set up
[21214.46s -> 21217.90s]  i think i could probably install windows 3.1 on dos box and get that to work
[21219.44s -> 21231.95s]  but it's that's not technically a dos game yeah that's it that we can end here so uh the next
[21231.95s -> 21242.34s]  stream we were live yesterday today well nothing tomorrow i'll be back on tuesday seems like a good
[21242.34s -> 21251.15s]  time to go tuesday the 19th uh there's a lot of stuff that i can do there's more dos i got like
