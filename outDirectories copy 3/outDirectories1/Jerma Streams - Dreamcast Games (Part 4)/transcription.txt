[1.40s -> 13.82s]  Hello, disc. Look at all these discs. One disc, two discs, three discs. Good afternoon, everybody.
[14.54s -> 31.03s]  How are you? Let me move this. What's with all the love and chat? What do you mean? You should be
[31.03s -> 42.30s]  saying I'm so glad to see love and chat every day. What are you saying? That shouldn't be a rarity.
[42.30s -> 50.41s]  My personal pizza. But uh, how you doing? We're gonna pick up right where we were last night
[53.69s -> 71.85s]  with space channel five, part five. Uh, no, part two, part two. Why do I have to stream so late?
[71.85s -> 83.10s]  Why are you late? So here's new year, new thing. Uh, I'm going to stop putting times in the sus
[83.10s -> 90.68s]  command because I feel like people start to get a little frustrated. Uh, I thought me saying I have
[90.68s -> 99.22s]  no schedule and I have no, uh, days planned. I thought that I was going to be able to kind of
[99.78s -> 104.98s]  blanket statement, say that I don't have a schedule anymore, but the sus is there to give like
[105.70s -> 110.34s]  guidelines. And I think some people are getting annoyed because the sus will count down to zero
[111.14s -> 115.86s]  as if like that's a TV channel and that's when the show starts. And that's not what I've been doing.
[116.58s -> 122.89s]  So what I'm probably going to end up doing is just the sus command will end up just being
[125.03s -> 130.95s]  a guideline for the day and the, the, the time period. So like for instance, if a stream is
[130.95s -> 139.29s]  starting tomorrow, uh, tomorrow afternoon, right? Pacific. Cause I, I feel like I don't want to
[139.29s -> 145.51s]  start to cause a problem where people are sitting here waiting for a stream to start and it's like,
[145.51s -> 150.79s]  oh, wait, didn't he say he was going to stream today? Yeah, he did. When, when, oh, the, oh,
[150.79s -> 154.79s]  the sus says like four 25 PM. So yeah, that's when it's going to start, right? I, that I would,
[154.79s -> 163.61s]  I don't blame you for thinking that, but I think it's for the best to just have the sus command
[164.33s -> 173.75s]  give the day and a general time period. Every stream is always going to be between three and
[173.75s -> 180.23s]  between like two 30 and four PM Pacific every single time, unless there's some kind of, uh,
[180.23s -> 186.07s]  extreme other reason why there's no stream there, but you can't really put in a sus command.
[187.03s -> 194.07s]  There's a stream starting between two 30 and four, four 30 PM percent. You can't have this.
[194.87s -> 200.07s]  That would be, that's like, that's like, I would be like the fucking repair man. I would be like
[200.07s -> 207.00s]  the guy, I'd be like the fucking dishwasher delivery man giving you a window. Oh yeah,
[207.00s -> 212.20s]  so this is German industries. What time does stream start? Uh, well, uh, you know, the,
[212.20s -> 223.00s]  the technician will be there between 12 and five, like, oh, okay. So we're just going to start giving,
[223.80s -> 233.10s]  um, essentially periods. So like tomorrow afternoon Pacific, but just know that all these
[233.18s -> 240.82s]  streams will always start somewhere around two to four PM Pacific. I don't want to start,
[240.82s -> 246.04s]  I don't want to get the hard exact times anymore. Just, I feel like it's causing a problem and not
[246.04s -> 251.48s]  really a problem, but I feel like it's causing, um, a lot of distress for not for some of you guys,
[251.48s -> 256.28s]  but me too, because I'll look over at the sus and it's like, oh, fucking hell. It's what,
[256.28s -> 260.12s]  what is it? Like I got to start in four minutes. I got to party the fuck up like
[261.08s -> 265.24s]  down. Okay. Wait, is that thing ready? So I'll be asked over here. Shit. Wait, why did I just
[265.24s -> 268.12s]  eat? I shouldn't have eaten. I should have just weighed. I should have eight, like four hours
[268.12s -> 274.95s]  from now. It's, it's counterproductive. That's what I'm saying. So I think it's a good change.
[275.67s -> 287.99s]  Derma, it's a joke. No, no, no, no. I, but I know it is, but it isn't though, because your time is
[287.99s -> 294.84s]  valuable too, right? It's not all about me. So if some of you guys have been here for, you know,
[294.92s -> 301.48s]  30, 40 minutes, your time is valuable. And I don't want you to have ever have a thought in
[301.48s -> 307.32s]  your head that like, oh, he's a fucking asshole. Said he was going to be here at like 3 15 fucking
[307.32s -> 316.92s]  idiot. Cause I mean that that's, I don't want to leave you hanging. So, so I think given a general
[317.88s -> 321.56s]  idea, so then people can be like, oh yeah, that's like, that's starting like probably like with the
[321.56s -> 326.28s]  next hour or so I can be like, I don't have to like sit here and like, you know, he's supposed
[326.28s -> 341.35s]  to be here. You know, your time is valuable. But anyways, don't need to read this, but thank you
[341.35s -> 346.02s]  so much for your streams. They're really helpful for these tough times. Thank you so much,
[346.02s -> 357.53s]  Mupine. It's just a joke. No, but even if it is just a joke, I know that it's like just,
[357.53s -> 363.77s]  I know it's comedy, but where the fuck is my phone? God, I changed the sus to like five. I
[363.77s -> 368.25s]  don't know where the phone is. I can't even make a tweet about this frame. Did I tweet this frame
[368.25s -> 385.35s]  already? I don't think so. Whatever. I have no idea. Anywho, uh, space channel five is where we
[385.35s -> 400.34s]  left off. Good job. Don't even read this to the same number of streams. My family works on a farm
[400.34s -> 404.82s]  and as you know, the economy has been tough this week. We all had to sell our hay beater. So I
[404.82s -> 410.58s]  want to thank you. Nice. Is that what this was? Was just a copy paste thing? That can't be what
[410.58s -> 431.10s]  this was. Whatever. All right. So let's go. Twitch notifications are broken. Uh, god damn it. Let's
[431.10s -> 435.66s]  just wait. Wait, I gotta get my phone. Twitch notifications actually broken. Do I have to
[435.66s -> 446.94s]  actually tweet that? Do I need to get my phone? Oh god damn it. One guy said yup. So yup, yup,
[446.94s -> 453.10s]  yup, yup, yup. Oh god. Hold on. I'll be right back. Not even two. I'm just gonna sprint down
[453.10s -> 532.55s]  the stairs as fast as I can. Okay. That was the fastest I think I may have ever ran. Not even
[532.55s -> 542.18s]  winded at all. Like my breath is perfectly controlled. Okay. So space channel. Let me
[542.18s -> 556.76s]  save it. Presented by Sega there. How's that audio look? Looks pretty good. Wait, wait, what?
[561.43s -> 568.63s]  That you guys, you can't make the hay thing. Copy pasta thing. You can't, no.
[571.16s -> 594.95s]  That's a compounded reference. All right, let's fucking go. Open it up. Hey, a hay beater. A
[594.95s -> 619.37s]  hay beater. Did we even launch this cutscene? I don't think we did. All right, let's beat it.
[620.01s -> 639.03s]  Is that Michael Jackson? No, that's the bad guy. That's the bad. That was Michael Jackson right
[639.03s -> 651.35s]  there. The best part about this is when Michael Jackson keeps calling her Eulayla. Let's go
[651.35s -> 663.98s]  Eulayla. Eulala. Quiet game? No, you just think it's quiet. It's actually not that quiet. You
[663.98s -> 679.80s]  just think it is. How's that? Okay, I gotta remember where we were. I'm gonna have to do
[679.80s -> 690.82s]  like a practice run because I was locked in last night. I think I'm gonna do level one again just
[690.82s -> 704.46s]  to get back into flow because we're going right to like report five. Try to do a perfect. I don't
[704.46s -> 720.04s]  think I'm ever gonna, I can't do that shit. We already saw this. We already saw this too.
[721.67s -> 724.39s]  What the hell is this? Oh, people have no idea that we're here last night.
[725.03s -> 735.14s]  This is Space Channel 5. It is a Simon Says game where you have to save the god damn it.
[744.25s -> 750.33s]  Those of you that also were not here last night. This game has a problem where
[753.99s -> 757.75s]  models just don't show up. That's a good indicator of what's gonna happen once we're started.
[757.75s -> 764.38s]  It's very random. Now I'm gonna load it up. It's gonna be in Japanese. Watch.
[765.26s -> 782.97s]  I bet you, I bet you a dollar. He bet all of us a dollar. No, no, no, no, no. I bet
[784.17s -> 806.26s]  uh Kim a dollar. Let's see. Give us models. Yes. So like I was explaining before,
[807.06s -> 815.82s]  I had an epic rage quit. It is a Simon Says game where you have to match and do exactly what they
[815.82s -> 820.46s]  tell you. There are no on-screen prompts. You just have to remember what everybody said.
[823.74s -> 840.92s]  That's ooh la la. So I have to do what they do. Can I get like 100%?
[842.92s -> 854.52s]  Let's see if I can get 100%. When is the Dreamcast arc gonna be over? Today. This is pretty much it.
[855.24s -> 874.50s]  Okay, uh Seaman is not going to be part of Dreamcast. It's going to have to show up.
[874.50s -> 881.38s]  I wasn't paying any attention at all. I think it was left, right? I wasn't even
[881.38s -> 892.78s]  watching the game. I was answering a question. It don't matter. I'm just doing this to practice.
[908.66s -> 921.58s]  Down, chew, chew. See the one part about this game that is uh I'm sure you've heard very evident.
[921.58s -> 934.84s]  I can't talk. I can't interact. This is just a silent gameplay.
[947.35s -> 954.63s]  Even okay even moving any of my facial tissue screws me up. If I like close one eye or like
[955.27s -> 964.07s]  wiggle my nose, I won't be able to do the level. I have to wide open eyes. Quiet. Staring and press
[964.07s -> 991.16s]  button. Can you hear the gun? So you're not gonna get me like Dunkin Donuts drive through
[991.16s -> 1018.78s]  stories right now. Maybe later. I think I'm ready. The B is you rescue. You have to shoot and rescue.
[1019.58s -> 1029.85s]  Tell a story over riot. I can't. You know how hard that's gonna be for me to do that?
[1037.19s -> 1041.11s]  It's gonna be a handful of adjectives. I'm not gonna tell anything. I'm gonna go around in an
[1041.11s -> 1073.34s]  adjective circle. Okay so three days ago I went to this already over already done. Not gonna happen.
[1073.34s -> 1089.37s]  Quit reading chat. The level the levels get I'm just gonna pause whenever I have anything to say.
[1090.25s -> 1101.00s]  The levels get progressively more difficult and more elaborate. So okay let's start. Let's do it
[1101.00s -> 1114.26s]  again. Uh this is statistically by the way one of the most rage quit games in video game history
[1114.26s -> 1122.20s]  if you were questioned. Look it up. Especially level five. There's a portion where those you're
[1122.20s -> 1125.96s]  gonna go up down up down left right up down right left up down down down down that's where everybody
[1125.96s -> 1157.27s]  rage quits the game. I stayed and I was able to get past it. Oh I just found out by the way
[1158.07s -> 1166.58s]  they're making a vr version of this game. If not this one it's gonna be a new one entirely I believe.
[1185.66s -> 1223.45s]  That's exciting. Oh nice. Take best of me again. The hardware note is not. This is on steam.
[1223.53s -> 1231.96s]  You can play this right now on steam. The dreamcast collection is uh I mean like
[1231.96s -> 1238.36s]  Sega bass fishing is cool for five minutes. It's not much there other than like a potential 10
[1238.36s -> 1249.93s]  20 minute session unless you really want to try to 100% the game. Just buy the good ones.
[1251.21s -> 1258.17s]  If you buy them all alone the good ones. Is it worth just buying the pack? Isn't the pack uh
[1258.73s -> 1268.20s]  cheaper? It's like eight bucks by itself. Wear space michael. Uh don't worry space michael is
[1268.20s -> 1274.87s]  available. I'm just warming up because I'm not just gonna jump right into the hardest levels in the
[1274.87s -> 1287.37s]  game. It's gonna be horrible. That's good. I need to get less than all right I'm gonna get higher than
[1287.37s -> 1307.78s]  67 percent. Down. I gotta like fucking get up and shake my body to like get pumped up so I can do
[1307.78s -> 1356.76s]  this. I'm still on slow. Down down. Was it up? Oh my god. I gotta get up and fucking shake my body.
[1378.26s -> 1401.35s]  I'm slower than I was yesterday. Okay um I'm gonna get up and shake as fucking hard as I can in a
[1401.35s -> 1410.70s]  circle. I beat this. I beat this literally with my eyes closed yesterday. I went to sleep. I woke up.
[1411.26s -> 1417.66s]  I'm on like a two or three day gamer cooldown apparently. Hold on. I gotta fucking get up and
[1417.66s -> 1428.97s]  shake around. I gotta put like a fucking pair of clothes on though. I'm in like pajamas. Hold on.
[1429.69s -> 1445.10s]  I guess I just wear pajamas. What's the fucking camera? You know what this is gonna be embarrassing.
[1445.10s -> 1453.80s]  I had to just put this on real quick. I put it there specifically in case I needed it.
[1454.44s -> 1473.53s]  I haven't shaved either. I said I was gonna do that. All right so all right that's that's enough.
[1473.53s -> 1487.22s]  I think that was enough. I just like saw a spider on the ground. That's not warming up. Okay let's
[1487.22s -> 1501.69s]  go up in the air here. This way. That way. I'll spin around once. I feel worse. Like way worse.
[1502.41s -> 1514.39s]  How about if I do I have any fruits? Do I don't think don't have any fruit?
[1518.18s -> 1523.30s]  There are no sweat stains here. This is a I just put this on. Do you understand?
[1524.28s -> 1529.00s]  There's nothing here. There are no sweat stains. I'm certain of that. You know why I know that I'm
[1529.00s -> 1535.48s]  certain of that? Because this shirt has only been worn like three times. I don't wear this in public.
[1536.60s -> 1539.88s]  You know I'll tell you why I don't wear it in public. We may have talked about it before.
[1539.88s -> 1543.16s]  Number one reason why I don't wear this in public is the same reason why a doctor
[1543.16s -> 1550.82s]  doesn't wear his lab coat out when he goes to get like food. You know it's like I'm hey that's me.
[1550.82s -> 1559.72s]  I'm a doctor. I don't hey if you see go to that hospital I'll treat you. Nah the same
[1559.72s -> 1571.38s]  reason why a doctor don't wear a doctor's outfit. Tape over the logo. Not the same thing?
[1572.02s -> 1582.42s]  It's the exact same thing. It's the exact same thing. All right preparing a streamer to a doctor.
[1582.42s -> 1587.62s]  Guys I really don't want to make you feel like potentially that you don't know this.
[1588.50s -> 1597.13s]  Um there are a lot of streamers and a lot of youtubers that make more money than some of the
[1597.13s -> 1602.57s]  best surgeons in the world and I know that that's but that you that might be horrible to hear about
[1602.57s -> 1614.33s]  that but uh comparing doctor to some streamers the doctor is probably just like what what I go
[1614.33s -> 1621.85s]  like this and like in people's fucking like brains and shit that guy plays fortnight and he makes
[1621.85s -> 1684.87s]  three times my income. I'm ready. Ten times let's be honest. Here we go. What? What happened?
[1686.20s -> 1706.42s]  Oh my button my button is fucked up. The party's just begun. Yes we've heard of the entertainment
[1706.42s -> 1714.39s]  industry. Yeah but somebody said streamers specifically. Space channel five. I don't think
[1714.39s -> 1721.45s]  like Ben Affleck doesn't walk around in the Batman outfit. It'd be kind of weird if he did.
[1729.40s -> 1730.60s]  He might. How do you know?
[1737.77s -> 1742.78s]  He isn't Batman anymore. He doesn't want to be Batman anymore.
[1743.99s -> 1746.79s]  Didn't he come out in an interview being like I don't want to do that anymore.
[1747.51s -> 1757.91s]  How many costumes are there? Did I get a costume?
[1769.83s -> 1775.13s]  Uh so I I think we're good. I'm gonna really pay attention.
[1775.13s -> 1780.65s]  You can go home. Some dude named Jeremy Elberton is the new Batman.
[1782.01s -> 1785.75s]  Well I mean I am a streamer so that means I have to be a billionaire you know what I mean?
[1786.87s -> 1807.53s]  All right. Report five. I'm not ready for this. I already I know I'm not ready for this.
[1809.16s -> 1816.73s]  Oh fuck. All right come on. Just pay attention. We heard it through Pines broadcast.
[1821.02s -> 1830.12s]  I'm ready. Yeah Michael Jackson is actually in this game. What's that?
[1830.28s -> 1833.16s]  The reading on Persian the president. He's standing right next to us.
[1842.65s -> 1847.13s]  All right focus. I did like the shake. I should be ready for this.
[1871.74s -> 1877.40s]  All right clean. Clean. It was so clean it smelt like god damn Clorox. Let's go.
[1900.50s -> 1902.18s]  As clean as a goddamn bottle of Lysol.
[1938.94s -> 1983.48s]  That was as clean as a goddamn bottle of detergent. Why do you have grimace in your party?
[1983.48s -> 1995.74s]  What? This one. All right. This one. I couldn't. This was the wall last night for some reason.
[1996.62s -> 2072.63s]  Let's do it. Persona. Oh what? I did it. I made it.
[2079.58s -> 2107.35s]  That's got to be the midway point. I think this is the checkpoint. The shadows. Another band.
[2108.39s -> 2113.91s]  No this is not the one. Here we go. I yeah I I I remember this. This is the battle of the band.
[2114.89s -> 2149.27s]  I gotta beat this. I have to make it out of this. Come on baby. That was as clean as a goddamn bottle
[2149.27s -> 2190.60s]  of water. There was three. I keep missing the third one every time. I don't know why.
[2220.38s -> 2269.19s]  Couldn't press it fast enough. I hit it. I did it. I got it. I did it. I did it. Okay. I never got.
[2269.19s -> 2278.12s]  I did it. This is the part where you gotta get. You gotta save the real one.
[2279.58s -> 2340.04s]  Shh. I got it. And save him. Don't fuck this up. Come on. That's gotta be it right?
[2362.65s -> 2414.60s]  Yes. Can't be much more after that. I gotta have pretty decent. 70 percent. That's the best I've
[2414.60s -> 2430.47s]  ever had. Thank you. That's the best rating I've had. Now he joins the team.
[2439.93s -> 2443.13s]  Oh man they messed up his face. What's wrong with his face? I didn't get a good look.
[2451.96s -> 2457.24s]  Everything is wrong with everything.
[2465.98s -> 2473.70s]  We got another report I think after this right?
[2489.56s -> 2496.57s]  Mobile is delayed. I'm sorry to hear that. So I'm at the drive-thru right? Three days ago.
[2497.29s -> 2505.14s]  And I ordered a large Big Mac meal. And I can't. I'm not gonna talk over this.
[2505.86s -> 2544.06s]  Purge report. This is report six right? I got the whole team now.
[2549.88s -> 2553.48s]  A lot of these like pointing. The walk point.
[2566.09s -> 2570.17s]  Uh oh. This seems pretty end.
[2576.49s -> 2578.42s]  Wake up.
[2582.95s -> 2600.98s]  Come on with the power of the whole team. You had more...
[2603.51s -> 2632.66s]  Not really good at ad-living are you? Stage fright there. Uh oh. Come on Michael.
[2677.54s -> 2682.10s]  Get out of my face. I'm as clean as a clean floor after.
[2683.43s -> 2685.27s]  I don't know. It's very clean.
[2698.30s -> 2708.41s]  It's so stupid. Why would you in the middle of your number there just go
[2708.41s -> 2750.84s]  hey you got something better to throw at me? Mr. Sprinkle. What is his name? Oh god.
[2753.70s -> 2761.37s]  What? What did he say? What? What did he say? Did he say down?
[2761.53s -> 2774.74s]  Neck is broken. He just went ahhhh. I don't know. It's down apparently.
[2779.00s -> 2827.30s]  You're supposed to hold down. Oh god. Get out of here. Did I lose?
[2838.65s -> 2858.36s]  That was a very quick technical break. Uh oh. Clap?
[2871.10s -> 2903.14s]  This is wonderful. Where's Michael? There he is. Come on Yalala.
[2929.54s -> 2980.84s]  Give up your... Give up your power. That's it right?
[2981.48s -> 2992.42s]  Ninety one percent. Holy shit. I got a hundred percenter level. I can't.
[2993.14s -> 3028.09s]  I fucked up that part in the middle. What? It's hard to do that.
[3062.63s -> 3087.67s]  All at once. He said Red Dead Redemption 2 music. Well that's how you get better than purpose.
[3098.90s -> 3103.42s]  We're in a full-motion cutscene.
[3116.98s -> 3132.82s]  Again, not very good at ad-lib. Not 200 percent.
[3160.73s -> 3184.25s]  Are we still going? All right. No. I got some things to say. I got a few things to say.
[3192.07s -> 3196.47s]  And look at how much fun everybody's having. All right. There it is. That's not the end.
[3201.53s -> 3204.89s]  It's not unusual. Is this Tom? What's his name? Tom Hardy.
[3204.89s -> 3209.69s]  Tom... What's his name? Tom Love?
[3213.75s -> 3218.30s]  Tom Hard... No. Tom Jones. To be loved by anyone.
[3227.58s -> 3241.37s]  So this is Sonic Team, right? Yes. So they made two of these games.
[3242.01s -> 3253.75s]  And they made like 25 Sonic the Hedgehog games. This was such a delight. This game is an absolute
[3253.75s -> 3267.86s]  delight. And yes, they are making another one. It's coming out soon for VR. It's not Sonic Team,
[3267.86s -> 3275.37s]  but a lot of the Sonic Team devs. Oh, okay. There was a space channel port for a Game Boy.
[3276.25s -> 3282.33s]  This is just so fun and whimsical and wonderful. Why not make this a more
[3283.69s -> 3294.07s]  elaborate print? Did nobody buy it? Nobody... It's just sold badly or something. Doesn't suck.
[3294.71s -> 3301.10s]  And it was on Dreamcast. Yeah, it kind of sits in a weird spot, doesn't it?
[3308.23s -> 3314.57s]  Derma by the rights. It'd be great to see another
[3315.61s -> 3322.84s]  ooh-la-la adventure. I really hope the VR game is not just a goofy gimmick that lasts like 30 minutes.
[3335.80s -> 3340.52s]  There are some bonus modes and bonus levels, so we're not done with Space Channel 5.
[3349.56s -> 3355.32s]  Sega, please give more Space Channel, Jetset, Samba, Nights, Julie Hatcher... Yeah, there's
[3355.32s -> 3363.90s]  so many different IPs that are good. Is Sonic the Hedgehog the only thing that they are confident
[3363.90s -> 3371.96s]  that they can make that somebody will buy? What else? Didn't Sega just put their money behind
[3371.96s -> 3378.68s]  something recently that was not something like... What did they just do? They've done something...
[3379.64s -> 3396.68s]  Yakuza, right, yeah. Sonic, Yakuza, and Football Manager. Rhythm Heaven? Yeah, I would love Rhythm
[3396.68s -> 3409.78s]  Heaven. All right, let's see what the bonus content is. I was actually looking for...
[3412.10s -> 3419.46s]  I think these rhythm games are a ton of fun, but this is kind of equal parts rhythm game and Simon
[3419.46s -> 3426.68s]  Says. You know, needing them no prompts. It's a little different than most rhythm games.
[3431.02s -> 3434.38s]  Do I have to like turn off the console here that doesn't exist?
[3438.28s -> 3447.67s]  We just got like an endless string of robots running. Do I just have to wait till the James
[3447.67s -> 3465.43s]  Bond music is over? Play... All right, so get on your radar here. We're gonna play Rhythm Heaven.
[3466.31s -> 3471.11s]  I'm gonna find a way to play that. That's DS though, isn't it? I'm gonna have to get like a
[3471.11s -> 3488.25s]  modded DS. Is there one for the Wii? The Rhythm Heaven on Wii is good. Okay.
[3491.85s -> 3495.69s]  That was really close. After I went down, things started falling all around me and there was
[3495.69s -> 3502.70s]  screaming all around. I didn't think I could move. I have a 3DS, so I'll figure out. Oh, and I have...
[3503.58s -> 3516.20s]  Um, I don't have a Wii anymore though. I gave that away. Just point the webcam at the DS.
[3518.98s -> 3525.90s]  All right, I want to do like the bonus mode. Can we, can we get away from this like,
[3526.54s -> 3537.56s]  loading screen? There it is. Doing the walk. Step left. It's, it's... Remember I told you,
[3537.56s -> 3545.27s]  it's right foot left hand, left foot right hand. Where do you think I got it from? What? What?
[3546.57s -> 3567.96s]  What? What happened? What? What? What was it? Was it up? Oh my god. It was up. Give me a
[3567.96s -> 3576.26s]  fucking break. All right, here we go. We got, uh, Ulala's Dance. Nonstop 100 round battle.
[3576.98s -> 3596.25s]  What's the best costume? There's 40 costumes. Dirty retro gear. How do I get that? Clear 24
[3596.25s -> 3602.50s]  consecutive trials in dance mode. Clear all 100. Clear report one with a rating of 100%.
[3604.73s -> 3613.62s]  Be in the game for over three hours. Well, I got it. It's ugly. You gotta clear with 100%.
[3614.18s -> 3632.60s]  Clear 34. Okay, we're going to do dance mode. Like a little character selector.
[3634.81s -> 3646.94s]  There's Michael Jackson. Space Michael. All right, let's do it. This is just 100 rounds.
[3647.66s -> 3677.75s]  Let's see what I can do. It's just Ulala's Dance. 100.
[3702.23s -> 3708.81s]  All right, level one complete. Level 10.
[3735.75s -> 3757.85s]  All right, we're getting there, getting there, getting there, getting there.
[3760.54s -> 3790.78s]  Level what? What? What? I don't understand. What? That's just chew. I'll get it.
[3790.78s -> 3832.18s]  I'll get back there quickly. Level 10 group. All right, let's go.
[3877.03s -> 3885.45s]  All right, here comes the whoops. That like threw me off.
[3886.09s -> 3942.28s]  Okay, my hands are so sweaty. I'm going to fuck it up.
[3992.31s -> 4064.02s]  Tapping it. It's so greasy. Meow. Oh, I thought that was it. All right.
[4108.71s -> 4112.86s]  I can't speak. I'm sorry. Toyota.
[4125.38s -> 4172.70s]  Toyota. Placement. Please get to 100%. Please. It's so long. Here comes Michael.
[4173.94s -> 4279.29s]  Another car commercial. Here comes Honda. What's another car company? McDonald's. Last one coming
[4279.29s -> 4313.86s]  up. Has to be. Come on. Sweat. No sweat. How did I do that? No!
[4313.86s -> 4348.33s]  It was the first one with like, oh, it just threw me off so bad. But like Toyota, Toyota,
[4348.33s -> 4353.29s]  Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota down. It's like, oh, fuck, how many was
[4353.29s -> 4367.59s]  that? And I was just getting old. Oh, I can't believe it. It was that. Shit. No, it's so long.
[4368.23s -> 4381.02s]  Oh, it was so close. Damn it. Hold on. Wait, I think I, I got like three achievements.
[4398.90s -> 4420.73s]  There it is. 100 trial. Oh, I'm so sad. I'm so disappointed. I'm so sad. What's we got? Can I,
[4421.85s -> 4429.70s]  can I do it in like different mode? I guess not. I thought that was like a hard mode.
[4430.18s -> 4436.14s]  You can go home. 100 stage one. Okay.
[4439.75s -> 4446.33s]  Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota, down. And what happened
[4446.33s -> 4452.44s]  was in my head, I was like, oh, that's hard. I'm going to count the next ones. And I counted wrong
[4452.44s -> 4456.06s]  instead of just doing it by the beat. All right. Let's, I'm going to a hundred percent level one.
[4456.70s -> 4475.72s]  100%. Here we go.
[4488.06s -> 4521.85s]  Oh, I'm so sad. I had it. Oh, I can't get over. That was perfect. I got to beat it and you won't
[4521.85s -> 4578.89s]  be sad. 100%. Can you imagine how impressed we'd be if you beat it? I know that's in my mind too.
[4579.45s -> 4594.63s]  I got so close and that was just the first, it's okay. I tried. That's all you can do.
[4594.63s -> 4607.11s]  All you can do is try. Let's get this perfect. I fucking God damn it. This is what happens when,
[4607.99s -> 4626.97s]  this is what happens. You know, I'm, I know I'm going to get, I'm telling you,
[4626.97s -> 4632.17s]  know what I'm going to get. I'm going to, I'm going to buy like gamer fucking baby wipes.
[4632.81s -> 4636.57s]  You know what I mean? I'm going to get a packet of baby wipes that I'm just going to have here.
[4636.57s -> 4640.57s]  It's going to be, I just put them all over my fucking hands of the controller because this is
[4641.21s -> 4652.07s]  wet. I need gamer wipes, baby gamer wipes. No, you know what I mean though? God damn it.
[4656.36s -> 4664.84s]  I pressed up and before I could press up, my like frog chameleon hands like slipped over it and like
[4664.84s -> 4683.54s]  pressed above it. I need like baby wipes over here. No, but the baby wipes are bigger. I need
[4683.54s -> 4690.01s]  like a drying agent, like baking powder or something to like put all over. Okay. I need
[4690.01s -> 4701.53s]  the thing in the Olympics. We are, we, I talked about this already like three years ago. Chalk
[4701.53s -> 4708.52s]  and you like, we talked about that already. Did I make this reference like more than two or three
[4708.52s -> 4716.65s]  years ago? I already did. So just imagine I said it again. I need baby powder all over my fucking
[4716.65s -> 4732.39s]  stuff. Oh yeah. I actually even did that. Yeah. I put baby powder all over my hands. Oh yeah.
[4732.39s -> 4747.72s]  Cause a cup head beat that game on stream by the way. I'm too obsessed with this game. I have to
[4747.72s -> 4826.65s]  100% some of it. All right. Let's do it. Ooh la la. Here it comes. Okay. Let's go.
[4841.75s -> 4891.66s]  Yes. I know. I know what directions are. Press B. What do you hear? Hey, save them all.
[4891.66s -> 4955.96s]  Save them all. Am I even going to get a hundred percent?
[4988.65s -> 4993.66s]  Hey, hey. So I can't get a hundred percent. I'm missing something.
[4998.73s -> 5016.07s]  Right, right, left, left, chew, chew, chew. So where are the secret timings
[5035.50s -> 5052.28s]  during the transitions? So where are they? There are secrets in the, in the cut scene. So I can't
[5052.28s -> 5067.46s]  get a hundred percent. Hold on. This one. So where are they? Okay. Somebody said this like,
[5067.86s -> 5080.52s]  on today's edition of Ulala's various man, just ahead. Was there,
[5092.98s -> 5109.27s]  I don't see any prompt or anything. I missed it. Already missed it. Character pro,
[5109.27s -> 5118.66s]  that's a rule of thumb. Anytime she winks at the camera. Hold on. Why would a secret happen?
[5125.35s -> 5137.83s]  It's in the first three notes? Okay. So I, I apparently just got it. What?
[5138.79s -> 5151.29s]  How the hell would you ever do that? How would you ever know where those were? I guess.
[5156.23s -> 5174.49s]  Okay. So I got one percent. Just use the guide. Okay. I'm fucking. So what is the highest percent
[5174.49s -> 5181.85s]  you can get just simply being in the game? There will be three horn beats at the beginning. Well,
[5181.85s -> 5187.56s]  in the second horn, when Ulala points to the left of the screen, press a button at the split
[5187.56s -> 5192.47s]  second. You hear the horn. Then there will be three horn beats at the very beginning of the stage
[5192.47s -> 5220.95s]  on the third horn beat. When Ulala points forward and screen moves away. So there's two. Oh my God.
[5223.32s -> 5232.79s]  That is two percent. After the first battle. I didn't hear a horn. After the first battle
[5232.79s -> 5238.39s]  with shadow, you will save two rich people in quotes. After the rescue, all three of you will
[5238.39s -> 5245.35s]  do a quick dance, then pause striking a pose. Just as they strike a pose and they pause briefly,
[5246.15s -> 5253.66s]  hit a button, hit like a button. Okay. So when I, when we get the rich people,
[5253.66s -> 5263.61s]  when we save, they're going to do a pose. Which button? I think it's the A button.
[5267.77s -> 5275.45s]  Just hit your favorite button. Wait, is this it? No, then you say, okay, after the rescue,
[5275.45s -> 5285.05s]  you will all do a dance and then pose right when they strike the pose. Hit A. Don't fuck this up.
[5292.54s -> 5303.94s]  Just spam A during the transitions. Don't make me laugh right now.
[5303.94s -> 5325.42s]  This is not the time to make me laugh. That is a legit strategy.
[5375.02s -> 5392.04s]  Rich people, we strike a pose. What? I did it. I did. I hit A when they did a pose.
[5392.76s -> 5411.67s]  They did like, I pressed A. I didn't do the timing. What timing? We're going to go with
[5411.67s -> 5429.16s]  the original burger boy technique. Here we go. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. You can't do it.
[5431.96s -> 5449.54s]  Damn. Why? All right. Even timing it to try to do it correctly. You can't spam it.
[5455.40s -> 5470.04s]  Wasn't there a hard mode? Or do I have to 100% every level to do the hard mode?
[5471.00s -> 5513.56s]  All right, here we go. He's torturing himself again. I'm not. He's torturing himself.
[5531.98s -> 5540.33s]  We just need to pass it. I don't care about perfect timing.
[5593.05s -> 5598.17s]  Oh, all right. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. All right. This is the one. Let's go.
[5599.30s -> 5600.98s]  All right. Let's go. Right.
[5656.15s -> 5711.10s]  Colors are blending into my brain together, I think. It's not hard. Bring on the cat. Time
[5711.10s -> 5823.02s]  for meows and then Toyota and then Honda. Toyota. Just playing. This is digital bop it.
[5823.66s -> 5826.46s]  Eventually, you're going to hit the fucking twist when you're supposed to pulp. It's going to
[5826.46s -> 5930.07s]  happen. Come on. I can do it. I know I can. Almost there. I pressed. I kind of had to take my...
[5930.07s -> 5942.28s]  Oh, God damn it. I'm going like this for like eight straight minutes during that. Just going
[5943.24s -> 5946.86s]  and your brain and your body eventually just have to like...
[5947.82s -> 5965.94s]  And then I just go, damn it. My hair is white. Continue from the middle. Really should just close
[5965.94s -> 6003.74s]  my eyes. How do I start from the middle? All right. Let's try it. Hold on. Let me move this
[6003.74s -> 6022.10s]  just so I can prove that my eyes are closed. Do you think this will work?
[6027.72s -> 6062.84s]  I'm just going to lean back in my chair. I need the visual. I think I know I need the visual.
[6063.80s -> 6093.70s]  I need the visual. It's like I have to see the hands moving. Mute it. I can't mute it. Coward
[6093.70s -> 6104.70s]  journalist. I got it now. It's over. It says continue from midway. It doesn't work. I just
[6104.70s -> 6143.38s]  tried it. Mute the rhythm game. See, I need that. Seeing his hands go up and down. After you pass
[6143.62s -> 6149.11s]  No, we got to 93% last time. I think this is like the first of a few different levels.
[6169.85s -> 6175.62s]  Now everything's scrambled in my mind now. Like I'm reading chat. I'm like looking at
[6175.62s -> 6181.30s]  fucking the OBS settings. I'm like taking a sip of my coffee. I gotta like put my brain into the
[6181.30s -> 6202.79s]  game. All right. I'm gonna do it one more time. Look. See? It doesn't matter. I was so close that
[6202.79s -> 6206.71s]  first time. All right. Here we go. I'm going in and I'm going to just be silent and stare at
[6206.71s -> 6222.82s]  the screen. I'm turning off the other monitor. No, I can't. What the fuck is in my throat?
[6223.86s -> 6242.07s]  Ah.
[6248.09s -> 6268.62s]  Let's go. I forgot. All right, go.
[6319.74s -> 6355.42s]  What the fuck? Oh my God. I don't understand. Oh, I had. Oh, man. I can't. I almost beat this
[6355.42s -> 6361.21s]  first and then second try. And we're slowly going down the mountain where like up, down, left,
[6361.21s -> 6367.85s]  right, A, B, Honda, Toyota, cat, meow, dog. They're all the same thing in my brain at the moment.
[6367.85s -> 6379.80s]  It's like, oh shit. It's so bad. Cause when you come so, when you get so close,
[6381.21s -> 6387.13s]  I just had to do one last little string and it was just too much. Take a break,
[6387.13s -> 6394.15s]  play dynamite cop and come back. Yeah. That's what happened last time. Remember last night,
[6394.15s -> 6399.83s]  I couldn't get past the level five. Came back and first tried it. Perfect. Yeah. All right.
[6399.83s -> 6404.42s]  We'll come back. We'll come back. We'll come back after this one.
[6404.42s -> 6468.73s]  What's the premise of this game? The premise of the game is you press button in beat.
[6468.73s -> 6514.34s]  It's Simon's. It's digital. Simon says with bop it mixed in.
[6516.28s -> 6523.69s]  Stop reading. Oh, I turned the monitor. I turned the chat monitor off.
[6556.15s -> 6567.46s]  I do back, fucking me, fucking me up. All right. That was the second time I got there and
[6567.46s -> 6573.22s]  fucked that part up because of it's got to be good. This is so precise. I fucking beat it
[6573.22s -> 6580.25s]  the first time, but I fucking didn't beat it. And there's, there's like a devil, there's a devil
[6580.25s -> 6584.92s]  sitting right here. I don't know if you guys get this with you too. Does this happen to anybody
[6584.92s -> 6592.41s]  else? Tell me if I'm crazy enough, but like, let's say you, you get to a very, like a hard part of
[6592.41s -> 6598.26s]  the game, right? And it's the first time you got there and you, you kick the thing's ass. You,
[6598.26s -> 6603.46s]  you do so well. Everything's going great. Oh, that was really fucking hard. And then you lose
[6603.46s -> 6607.46s]  right at a moment where you had confidence that you were going to beat it, right? All of a sudden
[6607.46s -> 6611.54s]  here he is, you know, you're not going to beat that. You're not going to fucking beat this.
[6612.10s -> 6617.46s]  You already got to this point at 93%. You got so close and then you failed. And it's just like,
[6617.46s -> 6630.81s]  get the fuck up, man. I'm trying to do the level. You guys get that? And then the angel,
[6630.81s -> 6639.53s]  the angel's this tall. Okay. Devil is a special edition halo master chief in the collector's box.
[6639.53s -> 6644.50s]  You know what I mean? He's this big. The angel's like this very, very softly being like,
[6647.06s -> 6650.02s]  I'm like, I can't hear you. You can't speak louder. I'm trying to.
[6650.98s -> 6654.42s]  You're not going to fucking do shit. And I'm like, oh, I'm not. I'm not going to do shit.
[6657.21s -> 6674.47s]  Huh? Let's go play crazy taxi. You're sure? Look at how far you got. You got to 93%.
[6675.59s -> 6679.11s]  Oh, well now. Oh, good. Good one. You did a really good string there.
[6680.15s -> 6684.15s]  It wasn't as good as the first time though, was it? No, it wasn't as good as the first time.
[6684.15s -> 6687.43s]  You're right. Hey, you just looked at chat, didn't you? Yeah, I did just look at chat.
[6687.43s -> 6691.10s]  Why are you doing that? You're just not going to be able to do this.
[6691.10s -> 6693.98s]  I'm not going to be able to do this. That's right. I know. That's why I keep telling you.
[6694.54s -> 6726.02s]  Let's go play crazy taxi. Get S's. No, I'm not going to get S's in crazy taxi. Wait,
[6726.02s -> 6736.97s]  German, no more taxis. But that always happens when I do very well the first time I attempt
[6736.97s -> 6740.33s]  something and then I don't do well for a couple of attempts. And then it's just like, well,
[6742.06s -> 6746.46s]  I've expelled all of my fluid apparently. Hey, hey, come on over. Have some fun with crazy.
[6746.46s -> 6751.69s]  No, no, no. Get off my shoulder. Oh my God. Did you hear that? He's talking to me still.
[6753.06s -> 6757.14s]  Hey, what's the place? Crazy taxi. You fucking idiot. You're not going to be able to get to shit.
[6757.14s -> 6776.10s]  Why does this look like this? It's very loud. That's better. I probably should change this to
[6778.54s -> 6796.44s]  crazy taxi cool down. Crazy taxi. So by the way, something I didn't know about crazy taxi,
[6797.24s -> 6808.20s]  they have a version of this on iPad and it's like an eye. It's an idling game.
[6808.92s -> 6824.07s]  Play the last Jedi. Actually, you know, speaking of cool downs, let me, let me go get,
[6824.07s -> 6828.89s]  let me get a glass of water. It's been about two hours. Let me get a water and we're going to do
[6828.89s -> 6837.64s]  a crazy taxi cool down period. I'll be right back. All right. Somebody, let me just say, okay,
[6839.38s -> 6842.18s]  somebody said, no water. Don't go get water.
[6844.70s -> 6852.68s]  Wait, where do you, where do you have me locked right now? No, no, no water. Don't you dare go
[6852.68s -> 6867.05s]  get water. What are you trying to do to me? It's been a few hours. I've had like a coffee. I want
[6867.05s -> 7061.21s]  to get like a glass of water and like pee my pants on the way down there. I'll be right back. Left,
[7061.21s -> 7075.14s]  right, left, right, chew, chew, chew, chew, chew, up, down, down, down, up, chew, chew, chew. Hey,
[7075.14s -> 7089.99s]  that's like wolf. What? Let's play a little crazy taxi. One of my favorite games. Oh, Gus,
[7092.98s -> 7100.25s]  please mod the music in. I'm going to go to jail. You know, I don't want, you know,
[7100.25s -> 7113.83s]  you don't want me to go to prison, dude. Let's see if I can get, can I, can lightning strike twice
[7113.83s -> 7133.83s]  with me here? I missed it already, but it's all right. I'm getting a lot. All right. I gotta
[7133.83s -> 7150.39s]  remember the controls. He's going to be streaming from prison. Hey guys, I have an idea. Let me play
[7150.39s -> 7154.63s]  a game to like just relax for like a half an hour or so and then go back and try to do,
[7154.63s -> 7168.55s]  how does this crazy taxi sound? It has it in the title. All right, let's try it again.
[7173.24s -> 7182.12s]  It's the devil. Yeah, the devil made me do it. Not only, okay, none of this did the devil make
[7182.12s -> 7189.34s]  me do that. While I wasn't looking, he like Galaga watermelon smashed the angel's head
[7190.06s -> 7209.00s]  with a mallet and he hired his own pretend angel that he controls that just wears the white
[7209.72s -> 7221.35s]  and has like fake angel wings. Don't pick up the, there you go. So what you're going to do is you're
[7221.35s -> 7226.31s]  going to tell him, you're going to tell him whisper in his right ear like crazy taxi. He thinks he's
[7226.31s -> 7233.75s]  going to be like calming down and like cooling down. We're a idiot. And he's going to like rage
[7233.75s -> 7258.20s]  with that game too. Oh, it'll be scrumptious. Oh, that's the one that baits you. The devil made me
[7258.20s -> 7273.69s]  do that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not reverse. Oh, come on. Still salvageable. I can
[7273.69s -> 7300.04s]  still get more than 6,000. Yeah. Three bucks, three bucks, five bucks. Yeah. Install the old music
[7300.04s -> 7308.10s]  mod. You really want me to like, you really want me to turn the game off. Go download a mod,
[7308.82s -> 7317.21s]  go install the mod. That's going to like derail the stream for the next like 12 straight minutes.
[7323.19s -> 7342.63s]  I might as well just play the YouTube video of the music. What's going on with the car?
[7346.71s -> 7361.38s]  All right. Next chance I get. Okay. Where are the angels? Where are my angels?
[7374.89s -> 7387.85s]  Roller coaster tycoon. I'm on a roller coaster scream. It's a really nice touch. I don't want to
[7387.85s -> 7399.05s]  pick that person up. I really don't want to pick either one of you up. Right here. Got to go back
[7399.05s -> 7429.08s]  to the marine plaza. All right. Drive the car up and over and bang. Don't get baited. Here we go.
[7429.08s -> 7438.46s]  Not terrible so far. Could be a lot better. Well, I think I'm standing up in the car
[7440.63s -> 7461.05s]  because he's fucking crazy and he wants a thrill. I'm not going to get there.
[7461.77s -> 7469.51s]  Just go. I can at least get to 33. It's possible. Depends on if I can pick somebody up right here.
[7477.08s -> 7494.52s]  I don't know if it's possible. I'm not going the wrong way. Boost it. Sir, 3600. I'll take it.
[7495.16s -> 7514.34s]  It'll be B. Good. Always 21st. Always. Okay. I will go. I'm going to go get the song that everybody
[7514.34s -> 7534.73s]  wants me to go get and then I'm going to go to prison. So what is it called? Just original
[7536.82s -> 7548.55s]  crazy taxi OST. Hey, come on over. Have some fun with crazy taxi.
[7549.59s -> 7568.46s]  Is this what you want? Is this what you guys want? This is the one. Okay. Hey, come on.
[7570.31s -> 7573.91s]  Lincoln chat. Well, do the mod. Why would I, why would I need to do the mod?
[7577.98s -> 7584.95s]  If I have the video right here, that's like use the mod. Why? That doesn't make any sense.
[7596.09s -> 7610.10s]  It makes the sounds better. Okay. So let me, let me like, just let me spend the next like 15
[7610.10s -> 7644.04s]  minutes installing a mod to crazy taxi. Are we for real about this? Okay. Also stream your
[7644.04s -> 7649.10s]  windows 10 updates. I'm not, I'm going to have to, I think I'm going to have to put a veto on this.
[7653.00s -> 7663.10s]  Like I just want to play the game, go get the original sound effects. I'll make them with my
[7663.10s -> 7678.84s]  fucking mouth. I get this, like a bunch of drop box files. There are like three, there are like
[7678.84s -> 7696.54s]  four, five drop box files here. Now let me get them. All right. They're in. I just like click drag.
[7700.44s -> 7709.80s]  That one's in. Okay. So this one's like, this one's about that. I got to like get into the
[7709.80s -> 7717.98s]  main frame on this one. That one's in. Okay. I think we're good to go. Let's, let's test it
[7717.98s -> 7759.34s]  and see if it works. There we go. It works. All right. Let's go. It worked pretty good soundtrack.
[7759.90s -> 7820.50s]  It actually makes you play better too. Stop the car. Why is my frame rate dying?
[7821.06s -> 7839.24s]  That's kind of annoying. I wasn't this frame ready yesterday. I got baited again. No, no, I didn't.
[7839.24s -> 7855.96s]  No, this is different. This is the lighthouse. I think it's the mods. Yeah. These mods are all
[7855.96s -> 7868.26s]  fucked up. It's slowing my game down. It's giving frame rate issues. What the heck? Sometimes the
[7868.26s -> 7898.76s]  mod had to load the next song. God damn it. I love the frame rate fix mod. I'm sure it's something
[7898.76s -> 7942.30s]  like that exists. This is zero, zero, zero. Pretty good soundtrack though. The music usually stops
[7942.30s -> 7976.12s]  right now. Maybe this is like a continuous mod. I'm gonna, this is gonna be the one. Forget about
[7976.12s -> 8005.82s]  drifts. Let's try and make some time. I didn't get tipped for that. Cross street. Do I have to
[8005.82s -> 8039.26s]  turn the car around? I might. There's so many cars on that fucking road. All right. This YouTube video
[8039.26s -> 8049.06s]  is actually making my frame rate drop. I swear to God. Sorry. Whatever. I don't care. The video on
[8049.06s -> 8061.03s]  my other monitor is making the frame rate of the game suffer. He's been exposed. The devil made me
[8061.03s -> 8069.72s]  do it. I don't care. Fucking goddamn YouTube video. It's like Flash Player playing in the
[8069.72s -> 8087.11s]  background. Dragging my frame rate down to like fucking 18. You can't live without the devil.
[8087.67s -> 8110.09s]  Are you guys the devil in that scenario? I try to get funky with it. It's HTML5.
[8112.20s -> 8135.46s]  Whatever it is. It hogs resources. No, we're only doing like a few rounds anyways. You guys realize
[8135.46s -> 8139.30s]  that even if I installed the mod, you would only hear probably three songs. The ones that you just
[8139.30s -> 8146.66s]  heard. I'm not gonna play crazy taxi for like another three hours. This is just to get my brain
[8146.66s -> 8179.27s]  off a space channel. Game over. Have y'all, really? All you guys are gonna be like this right now?
[8179.27s -> 8184.22s]  How many devils have moved into my house? First it was just the big collector's edition one.
[8185.02s -> 8196.86s]  Angels gone. Now, now you, how many devils are here? You guys are on my couch. You're eating
[8196.86s -> 8210.66s]  food out of my fridge. You're using my toothbrush. Laughing and high-fiving each other. You haven't
[8210.66s -> 8223.32s]  changed the category on Twitch yet. Yeah, I did. Refresh his crazy taxi cooldown. You're out of
[8223.32s -> 8231.18s]  toilet paper. You guys are like shitting in my toilet. You just beat your driving by and beeping
[8231.18s -> 8259.40s]  at me. That shit was already there when I started. It's all part of the plan. He's gonna fucking be
[8259.40s -> 8264.28s]  so angry. He'll never complete space channel five on this stream.
[8269.99s -> 8301.93s]  And I'm going like this with my hands. I'm so evil. New evil emote. That's not an emote.
[8302.49s -> 8345.74s]  Just trying to get money. I actually got a lot of money. I thought somehow I took a wrong turn.
[8346.54s -> 8371.64s]  Get over there. Come on. Oh my god, please. Am I even doing the boost right?
[8372.52s -> 8417.58s]  You come here. Isn't it out of into drive acceleration? Isn't that how it works?
[8418.62s -> 8424.71s]  Or is it the same time? I don't, I still don't understand how that works.
[8425.59s -> 8461.74s]  Yeah, I'm, I think I thought I was doing it right. The lack of all I want by offspring makes me sad.
[8462.38s -> 8480.28s]  Let me see. I want to just do 10 minutes because I want to try to get this boost correct.
[8481.54s -> 8485.22s]  It's in reverse. You shift into drive and hit accelerate.
[8486.28s -> 8492.18s]  Yeah, so how come, how am I doing it wrong sometimes? Can you just,
[8492.18s -> 8526.14s]  you have to be stopped for it to work? You have to be stopped, right? No. It definitely doesn't
[8526.14s -> 8543.05s]  work when you're driving the car normally. You have to be like it's stopped. I guess it doesn't
[8543.05s -> 8612.28s]  work. So hold on. So why is it not working here? It is. I guess it's working. All right. Let's try
[8612.28s -> 8620.12s]  it again. So what is the difference between arcade and original? What's the difference?
[8625.50s -> 8643.10s]  It's not, it's just different spawn locations. Okay. That makes sense. Let me try it here. All
[8643.10s -> 8670.87s]  right. Why? I swear to God, I did that the exact same way every time. What's going on down there?
[8670.87s -> 8706.57s]  Why is the city destroyed? What the fuck? Stop, stop, stop, stop. No, don't stop. Stay on the,
[8706.57s -> 8721.06s]  this is a lot different. Oh, so many cars are just in the way here. Some of them just parked
[8721.06s -> 8785.91s]  on the side of the road. Really? What the fuck did I run into? I don't understand. I think I'm
[8785.91s -> 8808.50s]  going to lose. Have I thought about inviting Son Goku? Um, nah, nah. Are you holding the accelerator
[8808.50s -> 8821.70s]  during the switch? Um, I am not. I'm doing, going into reverse, letting go, going into drive, pressing
[8821.70s -> 8825.94s]  accelerate. Like a half second later. Not even like a 10th of a second later.
[8842.49s -> 8863.19s]  Thousandth of a second. That's rocking. Did I finish Resident Evil 2? I did. I finished Leon's
[8863.19s -> 8882.62s]  campaign. It's done. I did not do the whole game, but I'm not entirely sure I will. Claire B.
[8883.26s -> 8916.30s]  Watch out for the other cars, sir. No points for that. Come on. Not good. Not good. Not good.
[8916.30s -> 8944.73s]  God damn it. Oh God, give me a break. It's all right. 75 cents for a jump, but we almost die
[8944.73s -> 8998.73s]  and I'm going to get like $3. Fuck that guy. I'm going too fast. Jesus Christ. I don't know
[8998.73s -> 9010.90s]  where I'm going, but apparently I went the right way. I have to. You're right here.
[9011.38s -> 9042.30s]  That guy's just rocking out so hard. Bye. Come here. In. I'm not going to be able to do it.
[9042.30s -> 9053.08s]  Is this guy filming? Hey, turn off your live stream. It's all right. I'm getting the hang
[9053.08s -> 9072.34s]  of the boost. How long does he need to cool down? I should have just played like minesweeper. All
[9072.34s -> 9088.04s]  right. This is the last cool down period. Okay. This is it. And then I'm going to beat it. Let's
[9088.04s -> 9091.88s]  get this guy. I got S ranking yesterday. I'm going to get it right now. Here we go.
[9092.60s -> 9137.34s]  He was like in an explosion. That's just what's going to happen. Fucking God game.
[9145.70s -> 9178.82s]  Try it twice. Whatever. Try it ahead. Get in. Straight into a fucking tree. Oh, I'm so mad
[9178.82s -> 9229.21s]  about that. That was a good turnaround too. Fuck. Any of you. Popcorn mania. Popcorn mania. There
[9229.21s -> 9245.93s]  it is. Get up. Where's a good pickup here? I mean, you're right here. I don't like this though.
[9252.34s -> 9278.70s]  Bad spot to be in. Out. Thank God I just did that and turned around. There's an asshole in front of
[9278.70s -> 9297.26s]  me though. You stupid fucking imbeciles in the road. Just throw fucking cards at random spots
[9297.26s -> 9344.34s]  everywhere. It's my road. Back in the parking lot. I think I just saved a few seconds though
[9344.34s -> 9379.83s]  by doing that somehow. Oh my fucking God. They're everywhere. They're in every direction. Cut me off.
[9380.47s -> 9393.72s]  I just got fucked cut off. What an asshole. Unbelievable.
[9393.72s -> 9420.92s]  No. You need a brake job, man. Seriously. You have the, in this game, your brakes are as effective
[9420.92s -> 9431.96s]  as a fucking locomotive. It takes like four hours to stop this car. I might as well be on train tracks.
[9432.76s -> 9484.52s]  Stop. Just don't crash. We're playing crazy taxi. You don't not crash. That's like part of the game
[9484.52s -> 9497.61s]  is fucking being crazy. See? Like that guy's dead. Everybody in that car is dead. It's crazy.
[9515.70s -> 9522.65s]  All those people. See? I can't control that. I can't control when the guy fucking drives into me
[9523.37s -> 9541.82s]  from across the pond. You know, the title of this game is not moderately fast service vehicle.
[9542.62s -> 9584.87s]  No. Reasonable taxi. Yeah, when is that one coming out? It's a horror. I don't like that turn.
[9585.51s -> 9634.60s]  That turn sucks. Oh God. All right. We're okay. What's the helicopter doing here? Huh? This is
[9634.60s -> 9695.46s]  aero. Green. No, I think I dove out of the way that I wanted to pick up. What? Got it. Oh fucking
[9695.46s -> 9729.29s]  whatever. Just pick somebody up. Almost there. All right. Green pick up right ahead. YouTuber.
[9729.29s -> 9769.06s]  Oh, I'm getting stuck. Not good. Very bad actually. Oh, I hate this fucking game's directions.
[9770.02s -> 9796.46s]  Give me a break game. What the hell was that? Go this way. Go this way. Go this way. You're
[9796.46s -> 9823.00s]  going the right way. Yeah, go this way. Go that way. Would you like to restart your computer? No,
[9823.00s -> 9857.61s]  I would not like to restart my computer. I'm ready. This is a pretty good title.
[9880.49s -> 9887.32s]  Anger field complaint to Sega. He's got an angry review on like the steam page.
[9889.21s -> 9895.34s]  So I got to a point where I need to do a U-turn and the arrow is pointing straight and then it
[9895.34s -> 9899.34s]  turns around in a tenth of a second in the other direction and I'm trying to focus on not crashing
[9899.34s -> 9905.74s]  into every car on the road and the frame rate by the way drops all the time. Bad port. I don't like
[9905.74s -> 9928.73s]  it. Should have got the mod. All right. We cooled down a little bit from Crazy Taxi. Let's uh
[9928.73s -> 9936.20s]  continue here. Let's go back. Had a small break there. Let's do uh Space Channel 5. This doesn't
[9936.20s -> 9951.45s]  look right. Am I cooled? I'm pretty cooled down right now. I should have just like ate candy on
[9951.45s -> 9970.79s]  screen. No, I should have just ate a whole bar of chocolate on screen. All right. I'm ready now. I
[9970.79s -> 9979.10s]  took a break. My muscle memory was able to uh get angry at Crazy Taxi and get yelled at for no mods.
[9979.10s -> 10080.34s]  This is easy to me. Look at how easy this is. Speed it up. Why are people doing Manka S? Cool.
[10080.34s -> 10141.45s]  Let's see if I blow it in the same place every time. Get off my shoulder. What did I just tune
[10141.45s -> 10195.29s]  into? The best stream on Twitch. I'm kidding. Probably the uh it's bring on the cat. By the
[10195.29s -> 10200.09s]  way can I pause it? Okay so somebody just said that I left for a while and came back and he's
[10200.09s -> 10208.90s]  still doing this. Um well what happened was I did a cool down period in Crazy Taxi which elevated
[10208.90s -> 10216.20s]  my blood pressure because I people you guys can you guys can explain right but I just I just got
[10216.28s -> 10221.08s]  here this first attempt all right so you understand this is what it's the cool down period is over
[10221.08s -> 10287.59s]  let's get this done I love this silent streamer it's the way it has to be otherwise we'll never
[10287.59s -> 10618.44s]  leave here it was fucked it up get out of my fucking way there's more oh I just needed to
[10618.44s -> 10679.46s]  cool down a little crazy taxi um what there's more why don't you come over here and join me

[11225.85s -> 11231.69s]  the first one that one is just on dreamcast that's not ported anywhere maybe I'll just buy it
[11232.25s -> 11241.77s]  because this one was a lot of fun you know why don't just get the first one I have a dreamcast
[11241.77s -> 11245.21s]  we don't have to have a dreamcast night in quotes we can just do it whenever
[11245.85s -> 11255.37s]  because I thought this is this is a great game a lot of fun rhythm heaven is another one yeah
[11258.14s -> 11267.94s]  all right so uh what does that leave us that leaves us with I wanted to complete space channel
[11267.94s -> 11280.65s]  five go back to flick oh wait actually I did I was going through my discs and there is one
[11280.65s -> 11287.61s]  more dreamcast game that was underneath hidden that we didn't do and I brought my dreamcast
[11287.61s -> 11292.73s]  away from the desk so I have to go like set it up to do it and it's not going to be worth doing
[11293.69s -> 11299.05s]  I can guarantee you this is absolutely not worth me setting the dreamcast physically back up again
[11299.93s -> 11313.40s]  but it's right here and it's gonna be such a waste of time what is the game uh it's not good
[11313.40s -> 11322.82s]  it's not gonna be fun do it I have you know what I bought it it's here we're capping off the
[11322.82s -> 11332.22s]  dreamcast we are done with the dreamcast except for in the future um space channel five I'm gonna
[11332.22s -> 11338.39s]  do just for fun I'm gonna play the whole game one night and then seaman maybe I'll do like a
[11338.71s -> 11342.63s]  seaman first and then space channel five because that's all the space channel games
[11343.19s -> 11347.27s]  are less than a few hours of game time unless you want to really 100 percent everything
[11348.57s -> 11355.46s]  so we'll do that at a later date uh let me go set uh no jetset I did jetset radio
[11356.26s -> 11361.70s]  but I had a hard time with it I couldn't really get into it I did this pretty large learning
[11361.70s -> 11366.10s]  curve that I couldn't really want I didn't really want to dedicate time to it for some
[11366.10s -> 11375.74s]  reason yesterday uh but the game is all right I'm gonna tell you what it is and you tell me
[11375.74s -> 11380.94s]  if this is actually worth me going and getting the dreamcast we'll do that how's that sound
[11382.14s -> 11397.77s]  the game is I didn't even take it out of the plastic there's a film of plastic on here the
[11397.77s -> 11436.23s]  game's called stupid invaders is it worth it uh well never mind you guys never mind do I have
[11436.23s -> 11445.14s]  to get scanned like fucking twice in a row seaman didn't come with the microphone and the only disc

[12536.89s -> 12545.56s]  you just you just expect somebody to just put like you did you just not know that it was the
[12545.56s -> 12551.00s]  disc that that was not the correct disc did you not put the c-man microphone in there on purpose
[12552.49s -> 12559.29s]  did you open the package and take the microphone out and then decide that I don't understand
[12560.41s -> 12573.48s]  send me the thing that I was supposed to have why would what do you mean I didn't read no

[12719.53s -> 12728.70s]  inside of package is going to be microphone and seaman maybe you might want to go on the computer
[12728.70s -> 12734.30s]  and ask them to make sure that it's in there because uh this is all the second used game I
