[0.63s -> 14.73s]  Good afternoon. Welcome back to another edition of ME! Hi guys. It's been 14 minutes since
[14.73s -> 25.86s]  Jerma said 10 minutes. That's not a big deal. An extra four minutes. Sometimes I say 10 minutes
[25.86s -> 38.31s]  and it's 40, so I'll take the four this time. Long minutes. Yeah, you gotta count them slower.
[38.87s -> 47.50s]  That's four minutes of my life I'll never get back. I'm sorry. Anyways, hi. We are going to
[47.50s -> 57.22s]  do, just pick up right where we left off yesterday in Disassembly VR. Maybe just joining us. And you
[57.22s -> 68.10s]  weren't here yesterday. This game's a treat. I like it. I'm having a great time. You take
[68.10s -> 74.95s]  things apart and that's it. That's the whole game. But it's fun. I don't know why. It just
[74.95s -> 85.51s]  like, it just squeezes my brain. It's very relaxing. It's very fun. And today, I've got
[85.51s -> 95.00s]  news for you guys. For the first time ever. Ever. That's right. For the first time ever,
[96.46s -> 102.41s]  I am going to be sitting down in VR because standing up takes too much energy and moving
[102.41s -> 105.37s]  around room scale takes a lot of out of me. And so I could probably stream for more than
[105.37s -> 116.36s]  four hours today. The chair! There it is. Never, I've never done this before. It's,
[117.16s -> 124.30s]  how does it feel? First impressions. The seat's a little springy. I like the color.
[124.94s -> 141.18s]  But here's the, hold on, for all you office friends. How's the spin? I definitely should
[141.18s -> 152.52s]  not have just done that before going into VR. We're going to take a minute here.
[154.58s -> 165.42s]  Just sit here. Spin? Well oiled, I'd say. It's pretty well oiled. Okay. I think I'm good.
[171.35s -> 179.82s]  Try spinning. That's a neat trick. Take apart this chair. No. You're going to be sitting
[179.82s -> 185.51s]  there the whole stream and you have workout clothes on. I'm going to get up. This is just,
[185.51s -> 190.54s]  look, this is my, when I'm sitting at the desk and I got the screwdriver,
[190.54s -> 198.07s]  I don't need to go in like this. Where's that screw? Okay. Where is it? Like I'm like a
[198.07s -> 209.10s]  fucking T-Rex. Like, now don't do that again. I'm not doing that for after part two.
[211.02s -> 216.14s]  God damn it. It's cause I'm too far away. I can't like see what I'm doing. You know,
[216.14s -> 220.95s]  I like, sometimes when I'm this close, I can see what I'm doing over here. I can't see what
[220.95s -> 224.31s]  I'm doing over here. Sometimes I'm just going to do random dumb shit like that, apparently.
[225.11s -> 232.90s]  But where am I? I'm doing Raptor part two. Spin in VR. Are you trying to kill me?
[233.78s -> 242.86s]  You're trying to kill me. I'm not doing that. The, the, the cord's going to get all tangled up.
[244.76s -> 252.09s]  But let me get the audio on. I can't fucking believe I just did like a dinosaur again.
[252.97s -> 259.13s]  And I didn't have the mask on this time. So it's all right. Sometimes you make mistakes.
[259.77s -> 262.17s]  I just happen to make them in front of a thousand fucking people.
[263.74s -> 270.82s]  All right. Disassembly. Are we good in the frame here? I think so. Yeah, this looks fine.
[271.62s -> 277.38s]  You guys can hear it. Uh, I've never done this before. How am I going to do this?
[278.26s -> 289.08s]  Around the back? I don't know if this is a good idea. We'll find out, right?
[302.41s -> 310.34s]  Hey, look at that. Oh, this already feels way better. All right. There you guys are.
[310.34s -> 317.46s]  I can see you. What do you say? What the fuck? Screw it in a little.
[318.18s -> 330.65s]  Is that bad? Did I even scoot in? There we go. Webcam on the floor and sit on the floor. I'm not
[330.65s -> 338.62s]  going to do that. This is not the way it should be. It should be like this. I don't like that.
[338.62s -> 355.30s]  It feels like I have a big piece of hair. All right. When we last left off, this like fucking
[355.30s -> 363.59s]  feels weird. I feel like I shouldn't be sitting. Fuck it. All right. How it's made theme or
[363.59s -> 367.03s]  riot. We did that last night. All right. Where we leave off? We left off here
[369.56s -> 379.85s]  at the missile. Do I, we already did. Do I have to do the missile? Do I got to take
[379.85s -> 385.88s]  up off this whole missile? It's like 5,000 parts. Okay. All right. All right. I'm going to,
[385.88s -> 399.58s]  I'm going to do it. I feel like I have to do, I have to turn, right? That's the only
[399.58s -> 408.81s]  way this is going to work for me in my brain. I have to like, all right, this is fine.
[410.20s -> 417.08s]  So we got, if you don't know how this works, lower the seat. What is the seat too high?
[417.08s -> 424.95s]  Why is the seat too high? I don't know. Yeah, I get that for you guys. I got it.
[425.59s -> 438.76s]  Is this it? I don't know which one it is. I'm afraid to press a button.
[446.38s -> 451.64s]  Oh, I just like flipped a switch. It's the eject button. Wait, it's this one here. I
[451.64s -> 472.15s]  think. Oh, better. Is it fine? All right. All right. Here we go. I'll see you guys later.
[474.44s -> 477.72s]  This is how you work with this game. This game is a game about disassembling things
[480.01s -> 483.77s]  and not, you don't, you guys are over here, right? And not putting them back together.
[484.41s -> 491.02s]  I kind of like this. This is, this is better screwdriver. How many parts are there? A hundred.
[491.02s -> 493.50s]  This is going to take a while. I hope you're ready for the long haul here.
[501.27s -> 508.34s]  Top part comes off. It's going to explode. It's not, we already tested it last night.
[509.14s -> 548.57s]  This thing is a dud. Oh God. I already don't like this. Okay. We're fine. Everything's fine.
[549.45s -> 557.93s]  Stand up. No, I can't. I, my back has been bothering me and like stand up and moving
[557.93s -> 562.33s]  around. I need to sit and work at my desk with my tools. That's the tinkerer. Okay.
[563.29s -> 575.85s]  Isn't that a good title today? All right. That looks fine. Can I get any of these off yet?
[577.58s -> 586.73s]  Oh, one of the fins comes off. Yeah. No cheating. I got to beat all these.
[591.82s -> 600.02s]  Room scale, seated VR. I, I got the wrong settings, but it's okay. I'm improvising.
[600.82s -> 622.33s]  What is holding this on? Is that it? If you're just joining us with, oh,
[622.33s -> 627.72s]  oh, I think I can get this off this plate. No, right here. This will come off in a second.
[632.36s -> 639.69s]  Guy like disassembles a nuclear bomb sitting in his living room. It's not even my living room.
[641.48s -> 661.34s]  It's my office, right guys? All right. Am I going to bloody nose? No. Am I? I can't tell.
[662.06s -> 675.50s]  Well, how do I get this off? There's blood everywhere. If I just didn't know,
[675.50s -> 685.72s]  there's just blood just all over me. That'd be so fucked up. The whole stream,
[685.72s -> 697.14s]  I just have like a faucet coming out of my nose. That would be insane. There's a lot of
[697.22s -> 707.18s]  screws in this thing. How many more screws are there? Someone call the camp. He doesn't know.
[707.18s -> 720.10s]  It's a missile. I don't think it's made to be disassembled. That's true. You're all right.
[720.10s -> 732.46s]  Okay. How many more? Oh my God. I got to get, oh, that was a big juicy one. No.
[736.12s -> 741.93s]  Whoa. Okay. There's the nuclear reactor. That's what it looks like inside guys.
[742.65s -> 758.90s]  First ever image of a black hole. All right. So can I get this out?
[759.54s -> 766.17s]  I don't think I can get this out. Can I pull it? I can pull it. Don't blow up.
[768.25s -> 773.45s]  I got to get a better fucking view than this. I'm sorry guys.
[774.49s -> 790.55s]  That's better. Can this come off? What is holding this on?
[799.64s -> 809.06s]  Don't explode. It's not going to explode. Oh, my rocket contest.
[809.86s -> 837.24s]  Oh, man. I'm going to win first prize. What do I do with this? Can I take this apart too?
[840.95s -> 859.69s]  I think so. The wrench. That one wrench. I don't, I got no idea. Oh, I got no idea.
[862.58s -> 875.00s]  Can I do anything else with this thing? Whoa. Okay. Put this down. This is the engine.
[877.00s -> 887.66s]  Can this come out? Oh, wait a minute. Ah, these are going to look at that.
[888.38s -> 910.36s]  We got extra lazy. No, I think this is done. What do we got left? 57. We're almost halfway there.
[911.00s -> 913.56s]  Can I pull the middle out? Yeah, this is where we're going to be careful.
[914.68s -> 923.18s]  So really slowly. Like a fucking magician. So there's a charcoal filter. The thing that makes
[923.18s -> 931.75s]  it explode. This is the thing to purify the water. That wasn't the thug. It's going to
[931.75s -> 938.31s]  roll. It's going to break the window. Oh, that's unfortunate. That was going to keep
[938.31s -> 964.41s]  rolling. Hold on. Give me that. Fuck. No, here we go. Yeah, I dropped something. Yeah,
[965.05s -> 977.29s]  it's over there. It's rolling towards the window. Oh shit. That's going to cost some money.
[981.40s -> 987.85s]  Those cheap windows made out of candy ribbon. I shouldn't have done the candy ribbon.
[988.57s -> 1012.02s]  What's in here? I think that's it for this. Give me another one.
[1015.66s -> 1047.42s]  Oh, stay here. This is the brain. I got to get the snippers. There it is. I'm trying to roll it.
[1047.42s -> 1084.34s]  I'm trying to roll it and break the window. Wait a minute. No. I thought it was going to
[1084.34s -> 1089.35s]  keep rolling. Riveting content. That would have been funny if it fucking broke the window
[1089.35s -> 1100.50s]  and you know it. He's still covered in blood from his nosebleed. He's losing brain cells.
[1103.91s -> 1108.94s]  What even makes this thing explode? This is supposed to be true to life.
[1108.94s -> 1144.41s]  It's reaching there again. All right. I don't even know what to grab. Can I pull this? Okay,
[1144.41s -> 1162.41s]  I can get the panel off. There it is. There it is, guys. Be careful. What does it say?
[1165.30s -> 1172.55s]  Explosive Tritonol. S-P-E-O-1-O-2-9-D. Total nine kilograms. So this is explosive.
[1173.11s -> 1187.08s]  Just sit that there. I don't know whatever that is. What else is in here? How many parts
[1187.08s -> 1196.65s]  are there? 50 parts? Am I missing something? Where are these other 50 parts? Are they inside
[1196.65s -> 1210.26s]  this dome? Hold on. Ricochet. That was worth like five points. It's still stuck in there.
[1210.82s -> 1222.26s]  All right. Give me the little guy here. No. I don't understand. What is holding this in here?
[1236.87s -> 1253.61s]  How do I get this out of here? There's another panel? I don't see another panel.
[1256.20s -> 1280.22s]  Whoa. This is dumb. All right. Here we go. We're going to be very careful here. No. Okay.
[1280.22s -> 1297.02s]  Easy. Don't let me near in nuclear power. It's still being held in.
[1303.93s -> 1324.25s]  There it is. Look at that. Interesting stuff. There's still 42 parts. It doesn't
[1324.25s -> 1329.00s]  explode apparently. Okay. So just set it over here. Just put it on the ground. This thing's
[1329.00s -> 1374.97s]  making me nervous. What is the other like 50 parts? What? Wait a minute. Damn it. Okay. So
[1374.97s -> 1387.14s]  it's this thing. Oh shit. There's more in here. Oh, this is the computer. This is the other
[1387.14s -> 1409.22s]  computer. There's two CPUs in here. All right. Let's get this off. Pliers? Jesus. All right.
[1409.22s -> 1425.75s]  Do I have to take this shit off too? No. What is this? All right. Can I take the top off?
[1426.31s -> 1444.25s]  Yeah. Okay. Let's hold this on. CPU connector. Can I take this shit off? No. None of these need
[1444.25s -> 1452.52s]  to be removed. Damn. That's kind of cool. All right. Cool. Now can this be removed? It can.
[1455.69s -> 1463.48s]  Nothing in there. Last piece. We've got, oh, there's one more internal thing. I got to,
[1466.90s -> 1473.45s]  no, not the crowbar. This thing. That's not the right tool?
[1474.41s -> 1498.04s]  And what world are you talking about here? No. Not yet. Where are these other? Oh shit. Okay.
[1498.68s -> 1510.18s]  Does this, that's it for that? No. One piece there. That's it. This comes off.
[1511.46s -> 1515.93s]  This comes out. Wow. That's what it looks like in there. Well, this is so cool.
[1516.57s -> 1547.34s]  All right. I got the lens off. Well, this is where the 50 parts come from. My God. Wait,
[1547.58s -> 1552.60s]  is that a reflection? Oh, I can't see myself here. All right. This is that.
[1553.88s -> 1567.37s]  This is just the toy at the doctor's office for the little kids. Is that it? Two more parts.
[1567.37s -> 1609.02s]  Bring up the beeper. I did it. Excellent. What's next? I unlocked the magnifying glass.
[1609.66s -> 1617.93s]  Am I talking to you? Yeah, I am. Oh, I hate when it does that. So let me just
[1617.93s -> 1627.75s]  fix myself here. What's next? I have to take apart a screwdriver, then a rice cooker,
[1627.75s -> 1638.30s]  and then the Titanic. This is going to be interesting. Take apart the Titanic. This,
[1638.30s -> 1641.98s]  I take a 30 set. This is going to be easy. All right. Let's see this one quick.
[1642.70s -> 1659.91s]  Get a good look at it. Turn it off. Turn it off. So I got a magnifying glass. Let me just
[1659.91s -> 1681.29s]  put it out here. This is cool. That's really cool. It just is. I mean, it just is. All right. I
[1681.29s -> 1686.97s]  got a magnifying glass in this hand. I really am the tinker. I can't do a hammer yet.
[1688.86s -> 1707.99s]  How do I pull this apart? Are there screws on the screwdriver? Yes, there are. I'm not very
[1707.99s -> 1745.43s]  good. Precision is key. Get out of here. Put this down for a minute. What's the last one?
[1747.05s -> 1751.93s]  Oh, look in there. That's where the batteries go. Anything else over this? No,
[1751.93s -> 1765.53s]  I think we're done with that. Look at that. That's so cool. I don't know. That's a film
[1765.53s -> 1791.86s]  canister. Batteries? That's not a screw. I'm almost done with this thing. There's a
[1791.86s -> 1800.98s]  little power switch. I need the little one. Give me the pliers. Make this easier on myself.
[1808.71s -> 1832.26s]  That's it. 18 parts left. This little guy? Give me screws? There's such a weird smell
[1832.26s -> 1842.49s]  in my room. All right. Interesting. So now let's put it in its... There we go.
[1843.05s -> 1849.93s]  One, two, three. That's it. I have to battery. Take the batteries apart.
[1850.65s -> 1883.10s]  Oops. I don't know what happened here. That's fucking cursed. What just came...
[1883.66s -> 1898.07s]  Is it flying around the room? I caught that in the corner of my eye.
[1900.15s -> 1902.97s]  I can't get this little tab. Come on. Give me this little tab.
[1907.06s -> 1917.80s]  Final boss. I can't pull these apart. I'm an expert disassembler, guys. Well,
[1917.80s -> 1924.87s]  this is definitely the next part here. There's the bit. This comes out the back way.
[1929.10s -> 1931.58s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. That's where all these parts are coming from. Look at how
[1931.58s -> 1945.08s]  tiny this shit is. Get it in there with the tool. The middle part? No, that's it.
[1946.36s -> 1951.96s]  Six more. I believe it's right here. Yes, it is. What do you got in here?
[1951.96s -> 1956.30s]  There's the actual spinning thing to the drill bit. I don't think I can get it yet.
[1956.94s -> 1973.06s]  There we go. I think that's it. There's only one more thing in here. What's left? Two parts.
[1973.06s -> 1990.65s]  What is it? It's the battery, isn't it? Is it the battery? Oh, I got it. No,
[1990.65s -> 2006.49s]  I didn't. I can't get this. Shit. What is it? Use the gun. No, the gun
[2007.05s -> 2011.86s]  deletes the whole level. It makes it so you can't do it. What about my neck?
[2012.50s -> 2045.61s]  All right, hold on. How do I get this open? How do you open this thing? Right here. Got it.
[2045.61s -> 2056.68s]  Done. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Titanic. I have no idea what this is going to
[2056.68s -> 2063.90s]  be like. No, don't replay the level. Get out of here. I have to destroy the whole Titanic,
[2063.90s -> 2077.16s]  I guess. So we're going to go this way. I'm going to stand up for this one. Are you kidding
[2080.90s -> 2092.76s]  me? I have to take the Titanic apart. In my chair, there's 151 parts. Swab the deck, babies.
[2096.62s -> 2105.77s]  Out of the ocean. Did we hit an iceberg? Is this like a level that's already pre-determined?
[2118.36s -> 2124.60s]  I just wanted to put my hand on the railing. I just wanted to put my hand on the railing.
[2124.60s -> 2128.36s]  I was going to do a captain bit where I've been on the seven seas.
[2130.44s -> 2145.05s]  Holy shit. I'm not going to be able to find that. Oh, look out. Here comes the iceberg.
[2148.49s -> 2163.62s]  It's just like a drunk fat guy in a chair. Oh, I got to get over there. Why?
[2164.90s -> 2173.66s]  Why was that an explosion? Okay, here we go. I need to go fast. I need to go fast.
[2174.30s -> 2205.91s]  I'm going to be the shittiest like James Bond villain. You thought you could make it out alive,
[2205.91s -> 2240.41s]  Mr. Bond. Not on my terms. Hey. Stop it happening.
[2242.01s -> 2250.81s]  The dining room. Not the dining room. Why did it just come out like that?
[2255.50s -> 2258.15s]  It's sinking. I didn't have to do anything.
[2258.15s -> 2307.08s]  Okay. Got it. I hit the skybox. No. The skybox is going to shoot back up.
[2307.08s -> 2341.29s]  It's alive. That's a whale. Oh my goodness. It's back. Oh no. The sentient wall is coming
[2341.29s -> 2364.04s]  for revenge. I don't think this is historically accurate. Hold on. Hold on. I don't want to do
[2364.04s -> 2375.83s]  this again. It's hitting the ground under the water. All right. Get me in there. I'm
[2375.83s -> 2392.46s]  already seated so it's good. Okay. Where's the dining room? Oh my god. This is so huge.
[2393.18s -> 2409.82s]  Is the dining room down? I don't know where it is. There's no map. I'm just
[2409.90s -> 2417.32s]  no clipping through floors until I find it. Hold on. Get out of here. Where's the dining room?
[2425.16s -> 2466.92s]  There it is. Okay. No. No. No. Not yet. Not yet. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop it.
[2466.92s -> 2508.71s]  No. Come here. Come here. Come here. He's gone. Sorry for that interruption. What the fuck?
[2508.71s -> 2521.77s]  I just wanted to put it down. I wanted to put it down. I can't. What? No.
[2522.81s -> 2546.20s]  I'm just. I'm trying to do a bit here. Why? I just put my hand down and grabbed.
[2557.22s -> 2570.89s]  Are you good? No. There he goes. You know what? Fuck it. I think we just have to destroy it.
[2576.87s -> 2582.84s]  All right. This is fine. Welcome to the restaurant. Yeah. We pride ourselves on
[2582.84s -> 2589.77s]  highest quality food. Do you have a menu I could look at? It's a little cramped in here,
[2589.77s -> 2603.05s]  don't you think? Yeah. I'll take the swordfish. God. Nothing can destroy the Titanic. I can't even
[2603.05s -> 2606.09s]  do the bit anymore. I was going to set up like three people and have a discussion about the
[2606.09s -> 2620.36s]  Titanic. I can't even do that now. Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can. You guys are going to
[2620.36s -> 2625.48s]  like this one. I. You watch. Just. Hold on. I got to. I got to get in there and make
[2625.48s -> 2631.19s]  people not flip around. Is that like I put wine bottles anywhere? I don't think so.
[2631.91s -> 2649.61s]  And can I go? Is there like a captain's chamber? Let me just see what's up here.
[2650.41s -> 2661.64s]  That's probably like a captain's quarters, right? That has to be.
[2663.58s -> 2680.90s]  Play the Titanic OST. Yeah, I can't move. I got to let me fix this. This is all tangled
[2680.90s -> 2690.82s]  up on the chair. Which way is it going? I have no idea. What the fuck is this going?
[2693.48s -> 2704.71s]  How did I wrap this around like this? I've got to go the other way. Saved. All right. We're
[2704.71s -> 2722.04s]  good. All right. Let me put on the Titanic. Wait, what was that Celine Dion?
[2722.60s -> 2730.36s]  Wasn't that one? That's a definite claim of the vaudeville.
[2741.35s -> 2770.06s]  Bye, vaude. Go, go, go, go, go. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get
[2770.06s -> 2790.06s]  there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. Get there. I got to do the T pose.
[2790.06s -> 2807.54s]  I can do the T pose up here, right? No, no, no, no, no, no. Like I, you do. Can I
[2807.54s -> 2842.55s]  move his arms? No, no, dummy. Stand. Sorry. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
[2843.19s -> 2848.54s]  Fucking God damn it.
[2855.06s -> 2872.98s]  Fuck you. Jack, you already killed two people. Just let me help you. Do it. Is it going to
[2872.98s -> 2911.48s]  do it? Is this it? Is this the song? I don't think this is the song. Is this even part of
[2911.56s -> 2942.07s]  the soundtrack? Jack, I don't know if I can... It's not... Look. Do you see the sky in front
[2942.07s -> 2952.94s]  of you? Yeah, Jack. It's beautiful. It is beautiful. I never watched this whole movie,
[2952.94s -> 2976.39s]  so I don't know exactly how the scene went down. Oh, it's beautiful, Jack. It sure is.
[2977.03s -> 2989.03s]  Let me put you down. Oh, it's beautiful. I know. Just watch out. Watch out for the railing.
[2999.42s -> 3011.88s]  Where'd she go? I don't know where she went. Oh, Julie. Julie. What's her name?
[3012.68s -> 3015.38s]  The ship is all right. I can go get her.
[3027.64s -> 3029.56s]  She just got wicked, witch of the western.
[3037.14s -> 3041.93s]  Jack! Wait. Come with me, remember? This is me.
[3054.22s -> 3056.12s]  Jack! Jack!
[3056.12s -> 3056.20s]  Jack!
[3065.74s -> 3067.34s]  I'll never forget about you.
[3075.48s -> 3121.91s]  Jack, did you hear that this vessel only costed $29 a dollar?
[3121.99s -> 3128.73s]  I've never seen the movie, I swear to God. I've never seen Titanic. I don't know what happens.
[3128.73s -> 3131.05s]  This iceberg, I don't know the history, but I don't know what happens between the
[3131.05s -> 3134.95s]  wind and the category of it.
[3148.89s -> 3175.75s]  Jack, look!
[3175.75s -> 3210.73s]  Oh, my God. Holy shit. I didn't know it was going to be that loud. I'm sorry.
[3217.29s -> 3219.53s]  Now drive the boat. All right, I'm looking to do a boat one.
[3223.37s -> 3227.29s]  Can I hear a clip? I need to know how loud that was. I'm so sorry.
[3227.29s -> 3234.97s]  I had to turn it up for the music. Was it that loud?
[3240.65s -> 3277.83s]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Holy shit. Oh, my God.
[3285.24s -> 3297.61s]  I really did not know that was happening. Holy fuck. I'm so sorry.
[3297.61s -> 3301.82s]  I've never seen the movie. That's why it was so loud. I had to hear.
[3301.82s -> 3304.30s]  Holy shit, man. All right, let's turn this shit down.
[3315.90s -> 3360.95s]  I gotta go pee. I'll be right back. I know you can see me. I'm still processing.
[3361.75s -> 3522.73s]  Oh, man. All right. We're going to have to reel it in here.
[3523.53s -> 3526.57s]  We're going to go back and disassemble a toaster or something.
[3526.57s -> 3537.08s]  We'll go back to the Titanic. Let's open it back up.
[3537.08s -> 3540.02s]  I'm going to sit back down. Oh, my goodness.
[3545.74s -> 3547.42s]  We'll do the rice cooker. We'll do the rice cooker.
[3548.30s -> 3550.38s]  Kim check. Okay. Do you want to know?
[3559.77s -> 3572.23s]  Nobody in there. I got this.
[3574.95s -> 3579.98s]  That's pretty much all I need to say. All right.
[3582.50s -> 3587.26s]  Subs. A lot of subs just come in. I missed them.
[3587.26s -> 3589.34s]  Oh, there they are. Hans Beats.
[3589.98s -> 3592.62s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[3592.62s -> 3599.34s]  Thank you for the ten community subs. Ten subs from Hans Beats.
[3599.34s -> 3602.22s]  Thank you. Much love to you.
[3602.86s -> 3607.59s]  Congratulations to all those that were blessed by the sub dusting.
[3609.11s -> 3611.67s]  And let's go. Let's do the rice cooker.
[3615.61s -> 3619.93s]  I think the volume has been lowered to a nice level.
[3619.93s -> 3625.16s]  You can tell me if I'm wrong. All right.
[3625.72s -> 3631.78s]  I don't know what that is. Why is there an assault rifle?
[3631.78s -> 3635.18s]  Oh, it's okay. All right.
[3636.14s -> 3637.98s]  Back in. Where are my hands over there?
[3640.12s -> 3642.20s]  Let's clean this off real quick.
[3651.90s -> 3655.02s]  Max volume. No, I can't do that to people for a long period of time.
[3656.68s -> 3659.00s]  Okay. Really loud shit is funny.
[3659.64s -> 3661.48s]  But imagine if you just clicked on the stream.
[3661.48s -> 3664.04s]  You just came to the stream for the first time or you just loaded it.
[3664.04s -> 3666.52s]  You went to like, oh, Twitter or I got a notification.
[3666.52s -> 3667.88s]  And you're not ready for that.
[3670.10s -> 3671.70s]  I don't want to do that for a long period of time.
[3675.32s -> 3680.50s]  All right. Let me get another sip of my coffee.
[3686.14s -> 3691.14s]  Fresh brew. Let's go.
[3691.14s -> 3693.78s]  We'll go back to the Titanic and I will do it normally.
[3694.58s -> 3697.26s]  I don't know what that means. It's left-handed.
[3710.38s -> 3713.58s]  I just thought of the dining room hitting the skybox.
[3724.20s -> 3725.24s]  I got to get out of this level.
[3729.38s -> 3732.10s]  Why am I getting like worms vibes?
[3733.27s -> 3734.87s]  Look, they're the worms.
[3734.87s -> 3736.31s]  It's like worms, Armageddon.
[3739.10s -> 3742.23s]  All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.
[3743.32s -> 3751.91s]  Why do I have this in my hand?
[3751.91s -> 3752.71s]  Back to the main menu.
[3754.62s -> 3756.14s]  Oh, my mind frame. Can you see me?
[3756.86s -> 3762.65s]  I'm going to turn that down. That's better.
[3764.36s -> 3766.52s]  All right. Let's take apart a rice cooker.
[3772.55s -> 3774.07s]  This is so much nicer. Look at that.
[3775.77s -> 3776.49s]  Am I out of frame?
[3777.21s -> 3779.40s]  No, no. Let me frame.
[3780.04s -> 3787.83s]  Can I turn it?
[3789.94s -> 3790.98s]  It's actually has water in it.
[3804.73s -> 3805.61s]  Don't need that.
[3805.61s -> 3807.96s]  It's dirty.
[3810.97s -> 3811.85s]  Cut that shit out.
[3812.49s -> 3818.87s]  All right. So we've got the button here.
[3818.87s -> 3819.51s]  Can I lift it up?
[3820.07s -> 3823.54s]  The bottom. There's a screw on the bottom.
[3824.18s -> 3825.46s]  Can I rip this off?
[3825.46s -> 3827.72s]  I don't think so.
[3827.72s -> 3828.68s]  How many parts are in this?
[3829.32s -> 3830.92s]  59. All right. Well, this is a screw.
[3836.07s -> 3837.11s]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[3838.07s -> 3843.05s]  Probably more of this.
[3843.77s -> 3845.06s]  Let me lean forward here.
[3845.06s -> 3845.94s]  Let me get a good lean.
[3846.90s -> 3853.74s]  No, no, no.
[3854.70s -> 3858.34s]  Give me the pliers.
[3865.53s -> 3867.05s]  That's tiny. Look at this.
[3867.05s -> 3868.41s]  I can make it. I got to get the microscope.
[3869.29s -> 3873.94s]  This is next level small.
[3905.21s -> 3906.25s]  God damn it.
[3912.07s -> 3920.22s]  Let's pick it up.
[3920.22s -> 3926.82s]  All right. Now I can.
[3926.82s -> 3930.74s]  Can I grab these?
[3930.74s -> 3931.46s]  You can grab this.
[3932.10s -> 3933.14s]  Stop doing that.
[3933.14s -> 3934.42s]  All right. I need a little screwdriver.
[3937.93s -> 3939.61s]  And up. That's a bomb.
[3943.00s -> 3947.35s]  This one. Really?
[3947.35s -> 3949.61s]  Look, is it the other one?
[3952.81s -> 3956.60s]  I can't get that.
[3956.60s -> 3960.79s]  Shit. Am I crazy here?
[3963.13s -> 3964.17s]  No, I'm not crazy.
[3965.80s -> 3966.84s]  I'm not crazy.
[3966.84s -> 3970.42s]  I told you I wasn't crazy.
[3970.42s -> 3971.77s]  Is there another one?
[3977.56s -> 3978.52s]  Now I got to use this.
[3981.42s -> 3985.51s]  No. What tool?
[3992.10s -> 3993.46s]  That's a tiny little screw.
[3993.46s -> 3994.50s]  I didn't think I was going to need this.
[3995.06s -> 4000.22s]  All right. There's another one here.
[4000.22s -> 4001.50s]  Oh, okay. That comes off.
[4002.52s -> 4003.96s]  Beautiful. Then this thing's going to come out.
[4010.20s -> 4011.00s]  Snip those.
[4014.65s -> 4015.37s]  All right. Get in there.
[4016.57s -> 4017.93s]  Snip these with the pliers.
[4023.88s -> 4026.60s]  That felt fantastic to do that.
[4027.75s -> 4028.55s]  I'm not even kidding.
[4029.35s -> 4030.31s]  I'm not even messing around.
[4034.06s -> 4034.86s]  That felt so...
[4034.86s -> 4035.74s]  I'm not even kidding.
[4039.14s -> 4042.58s]  Okay. There goes those.
[4043.22s -> 4046.47s]  This whole thing.
[4047.35s -> 4050.49s]  Oh, that's the dirty part.
[4054.12s -> 4054.84s]  Oh, shit.
[4055.48s -> 4060.04s]  Okay. I might have to deal with that later.
[4065.30s -> 4068.63s]  Fuck. 24 parts left.
[4071.29s -> 4072.09s]  In what world?
[4072.73s -> 4074.33s]  What has 24 parts in it?
[4078.33s -> 4078.73s]  Ring.
[4083.34s -> 4084.46s]  All right. 24.
[4090.54s -> 4092.22s]  Is this still something I didn't see in here?
[4100.78s -> 4101.18s]  This whole...
[4101.18s -> 4101.98s]  Is this going to come out?
[4103.42s -> 4104.54s]  Oh, look at these screws.
[4118.09s -> 4118.89s]  Is there more?
[4118.89s -> 4120.25s]  There's another one.
[4120.25s -> 4122.28s]  Oh, my God.
[4122.28s -> 4122.60s]  All right.
[4122.60s -> 4124.28s]  So I think this one's done.
[4125.24s -> 4126.12s]  Anything else in here?
[4129.61s -> 4130.17s]  Yeah, there is.
[4130.17s -> 4130.81s]  Flip it around.
[4139.11s -> 4140.71s]  No. Which one?
[4140.71s -> 4141.11s]  Pliers?
[4148.47s -> 4151.19s]  Guys, I don't know where the other 20-plus pieces are.
[4151.99s -> 4153.56s]  Am I missing something?
[4164.81s -> 4165.93s]  Inside the lid.
[4178.20s -> 4179.64s]  Really? This is so weird.
[4179.64s -> 4186.87s]  I don't... What?
[4186.87s -> 4188.23s]  A wrench?
[4188.23s -> 4189.93s]  How do I get this out?
[4195.46s -> 4196.18s]  All right.
[4196.18s -> 4202.30s]  What the hell's going on?
[4204.63s -> 4205.35s]  Hey!
[4205.35s -> 4212.31s]  Hey!
[4222.02s -> 4222.34s]  Got it.
[4223.74s -> 4223.98s]  No.
[4225.61s -> 4227.37s]  Why is it locked shut?
[4227.37s -> 4232.42s]  Give me my thing.
[4232.42s -> 4241.59s]  Are there this many things up here?
[4242.15s -> 4242.87s]  That are...
[4242.87s -> 4247.78s]  Shit.
[4270.06s -> 4271.06s]  No?
[4271.06s -> 4271.30s]  Hey.
[4272.28s -> 4273.00s]  Hey!
[4273.00s -> 4273.56s]  Hey!
[4273.56s -> 4286.66s]  How do I get this off?
[4286.66s -> 4295.50s]  This lid is locked shut.
[4295.50s -> 4298.62s]  Six more parts, apparently.
[4298.62s -> 4304.70s]  Why can I not get in here?
[4304.70s -> 4306.22s]  Check the hinge inside the lid.
[4306.22s -> 4308.30s]  Yeah, I'm trying to, like, wedge it in there.
[4309.75s -> 4310.79s]  You think I would be...
[4310.79s -> 4311.67s]  I think I fucked it up.
[4314.94s -> 4316.94s]  This looks like I can move it out, but I can't grab it.
[4317.74s -> 4324.60s]  Wait, what's going on?
[4325.24s -> 4328.07s]  What's going on?
[4328.07s -> 4331.82s]  Where's everybody freaking out?
[4333.51s -> 4334.47s]  Stick your face in there.
[4334.47s -> 4335.27s]  I think I may have bugged it.
[4335.99s -> 4339.24s]  Because this was opening before,
[4339.24s -> 4340.20s]  and now it's not opening.
[4340.20s -> 4341.32s]  The hinge is just gone.
[4345.85s -> 4346.35s]  Ah!
[4347.29s -> 4348.89s]  It's... Hmm...
[4348.89s -> 4350.09s]  What the fuck do I do about this?
[4351.72s -> 4352.92s]  I can't grab this lid.
[4352.92s -> 4353.80s]  Maybe a crowbar?
[4354.52s -> 4361.51s]  I gotta pry this thing open.
[4362.39s -> 4368.26s]  Ah, something ain't right.
[4368.26s -> 4368.98s]  Something ain't right.
[4369.94s -> 4371.46s]  Unfortunately, something's not right.
[4372.26s -> 4381.67s]  It's worth a shot.
[4382.39s -> 4385.05s]  Damn it!
[4385.05s -> 4385.55s]  No!
[4387.26s -> 4387.98s]  Oh, the work!
[4394.94s -> 4395.58s]  Just shoot it.
[4396.76s -> 4397.88s]  Turn it off and turn it on.
[4397.88s -> 4398.68s]  Use another part.
[4399.83s -> 4401.11s]  Uh, I'm so curious.
[4401.11s -> 4402.39s]  Is that the only thing that's left?
[4403.51s -> 4404.79s]  I can't use the hammer right now.
[4405.35s -> 4411.61s]  Okay, there's apparently something right here.
[4414.89s -> 4415.69s]  What is right here?
[4416.33s -> 4416.81s]  This thing?
[4417.45s -> 4426.25s]  I mean, this looks like it's more than one piece, right?
[4427.05s -> 4435.02s]  Yeah, it's this thing right here.
[4435.90s -> 4445.58s]  I can't, like, open this?
[4446.30s -> 4449.24s]  Or is it this?
[4450.79s -> 4451.51s]  Oh, shit!
[4452.31s -> 4453.03s]  It's right there.
[4459.96s -> 4461.00s]  What do I need?
[4461.00s -> 4461.48s]  Fires?
[4462.12s -> 4466.31s]  No, not the wrench.
[4468.38s -> 4469.26s]  Pliers?
[4469.26s -> 4470.70s]  What do I, how do I open this fucking thing?
[4471.26s -> 4475.29s]  I can't just grab that?
[4480.79s -> 4481.43s]  What?
[4481.43s -> 4485.21s]  Is something holding it?
[4485.21s -> 4486.98s]  What is holding this on?
[4486.98s -> 4487.70s]  Is there a screw?
[4497.59s -> 4498.79s]  Where's the magnifying glass?
[4498.79s -> 4500.23s]  Where, what am I missing here?
[4500.87s -> 4503.59s]  Look, I think there's a,
[4503.59s -> 4505.99s]  there's a tiny, oh my god.
[4507.32s -> 4508.36s]  Ah, Jesus.
[4508.36s -> 4514.31s]  Okay, don't shoot it.
[4514.31s -> 4515.27s]  Look at this little screw.
[4518.66s -> 4520.18s]  Hey, hey, blink and you'll miss it.
[4520.82s -> 4523.61s]  Is that the regular screwdriver?
[4523.61s -> 4530.68s]  All right, who's that?
[4530.68s -> 4531.64s]  How many more?
[4531.64s -> 4532.76s]  Four pieces left.
[4533.64s -> 4536.34s]  Shit, really?
[4537.14s -> 4540.78s]  This maybe?
[4545.53s -> 4546.82s]  All right, let's see.
[4547.70s -> 4552.34s]  Shit.
[4554.74s -> 4555.78s]  I might have to shoot this.
[4564.33s -> 4564.81s]  Damn it!
[4565.37s -> 4567.34s]  What about, is it, maybe it's behind it?
[4571.06s -> 4573.93s]  No, come on.
[4574.65s -> 4577.21s]  I have to ruin the level.
[4577.93s -> 4582.34s]  Just glitch out with it?
[4582.90s -> 4584.22s]  Not a bad idea.
[4611.00s -> 4636.68s]  Open the lid!
[4636.68s -> 4639.56s]  Fuck!
[4639.56s -> 4641.00s]  Now the level's ruined.
[4641.00s -> 4649.14s]  I've disappointed.
[4654.87s -> 4656.79s]  You don't get a check if you don't do it right.
[4656.79s -> 4657.91s]  God damn it, really.
[4663.72s -> 4665.00s]  A phone, a jigsaw.
[4665.00s -> 4665.64s]  Let's do the car.
[4668.81s -> 4669.93s]  This is a real car.
[4673.93s -> 4674.73s]  Okay.
[4674.73s -> 4678.82s]  How many parts?
[4679.64s -> 4682.54s]  103.
[4682.54s -> 4683.58s]  Cool, cool, look at that.
[4683.58s -> 4684.46s]  Oh, this is a manual.
[4685.66s -> 4686.38s]  Nice seats.
[4686.94s -> 4689.88s]  Let's get everybody in here.
[4705.40s -> 4705.96s]  That's fine.
[4706.68s -> 4725.10s]  Road trip.
[4725.10s -> 4735.43s]  There's too many people in the car.
[4735.43s -> 4736.63s]  It's the clown car.
[4737.19s -> 4750.71s]  Hey, can you move back a little?
[4750.71s -> 4751.51s]  He's, all right.
[4751.51s -> 4753.43s]  Can you at least go out the other window?
[4753.43s -> 4756.82s]  That's, whatever.
[4756.82s -> 4758.26s]  All right, I need to get in there and drive it.
[4758.58s -> 4770.58s]  This is like a subway.
[4771.14s -> 4772.34s]  Like, oh, Jesus.
[4772.34s -> 4775.05s]  This, ding, ding, ding.
[4775.05s -> 4777.69s]  No, you get, oh, don't cough on me.
[4777.69s -> 4778.33s]  God.
[4778.33s -> 4781.58s]  All right, that's good.
[4781.58s -> 4783.98s]  Let's give it a try.
[4783.98s -> 4788.41s]  Oh, is this some kind of a car engine thing?
[4788.41s -> 4792.66s]  All right, shut up back there.
[4802.39s -> 4814.38s]  This is like nobody.
[4818.76s -> 4820.76s]  Get the fuck, man.
[4820.76s -> 4822.84s]  Even when I'm sitting down,
[4822.84s -> 4825.80s]  you're like caught up your ass.
[4827.05s -> 4828.17s]  All right, here we go.
[4828.17s -> 4830.82s]  Can I beep?
[4830.82s -> 4835.70s]  Can I turn on the radio?
[4877.75s -> 4878.47s]  Where are we?
[4885.26s -> 4886.38s]  The clowns!
[4891.26s -> 4892.54s]  Get them out, quick.
[4896.34s -> 4910.76s]  Out the back.
[4910.76s -> 4911.32s]  Save them.
[4912.04s -> 4915.13s]  All right, let me go back.
[4915.13s -> 4925.51s]  This is cool, though.
[4925.51s -> 4931.99s]  I like sitting in here.
[4931.99s -> 4933.99s]  All right, should I load up with clowns
[4933.99s -> 4935.43s]  and play clown music in the background?
[4935.99s -> 4937.59s]  And then like just drive them?
[4937.59s -> 4945.54s]  Maybe like, let's go with 50.
[4945.54s -> 4947.72s]  And my computer might crash.
[4953.29s -> 4954.97s]  Stream's probably gonna turn off.
[4954.97s -> 4956.49s]  I gotta place them perfectly, though.
[4959.58s -> 4969.08s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[4970.41s -> 4972.49s]  Eight, nine.
[4972.49s -> 4991.16s]  I feel like I'm hiding in a bunch of stuffed animals.
[4992.84s -> 4993.72s]  You're not gonna find me.
[4994.28s -> 5003.99s]  I lost count.
[5003.99s -> 5023.08s]  I don't even know how many are in here.
[5023.08s -> 5026.42s]  Is everybody counting?
[5026.42s -> 5026.92s]  Jesus.
[5028.49s -> 5029.69s]  My computer, that's it.
[5030.17s -> 5030.65s]  No, that's it.
[5030.65s -> 5030.89s]  That's it.
[5030.89s -> 5031.77s]  My computer's gonna break.
[5035.10s -> 5036.14s]  Oh, God, that's it.
[5036.14s -> 5036.94s]  I can feel it already.
[5039.29s -> 5040.33s]  That's 42.
[5040.33s -> 5042.79s]  Oh, eight more?
[5042.79s -> 5055.45s]  I can't do that.
[5055.45s -> 5056.65s]  We need 50.
[5056.65s -> 5064.89s]  The stream's going to turn off.
[5064.89s -> 5070.65s]  Funny clown music loop.
[5070.65s -> 5071.45s]  That's not a good one.
[5076.87s -> 5078.79s]  Come on, what's like circus music?
[5079.75s -> 5083.77s]  Am I gonna like upload one of these?
[5083.77s -> 5084.49s]  Should I make one?
[5094.94s -> 5095.90s]  This is circus music.
[5097.91s -> 5107.86s]  Okay, here we go.
[5107.86s -> 5108.36s]  Ready?
[5242.74s -> 5243.54s]  What happened to the music?
[5254.02s -> 5256.31s]  I'm running over the cord.
[5256.31s -> 5263.03s]  That was weird.
[5263.03s -> 5267.94s]  All right, I need to take this apart.
[5267.94s -> 5269.14s]  I gotta do this for real.
[5269.14s -> 5281.38s]  Jesus Christ.
[5281.38s -> 5284.49s]  That's too many mannequins.
[5284.49s -> 5303.74s]  I wonder what's gonna happen to all this wood.
[5303.74s -> 5305.66s]  I'll see you guys when I stream next.
[5306.94s -> 5308.71s]  I didn't do anything.
[5308.71s -> 5309.03s]  Never mind.
[5309.03s -> 5309.53s]  Move on.
[5309.99s -> 5312.44s]  We're good to go.
[5313.24s -> 5316.74s]  I restart this before my video card dies.
[5317.38s -> 5322.18s]  All right, let's get it.
[5322.18s -> 5322.90s]  Let's take it apart.
[5327.29s -> 5327.69s]  All right.
[5329.90s -> 5330.62s]  How many parts?
[5330.62s -> 5331.66s]  103.
[5331.66s -> 5335.21s]  This should be fun.
[5335.21s -> 5335.77s]  Nice hair.
[5336.49s -> 5340.79s]  Does my hair get fucked up?
[5348.28s -> 5351.80s]  Get in there and stay in there before I get angry.
[5351.80s -> 5354.49s]  Does the mirror come out?
[5354.49s -> 5354.89s]  It does.
[5358.73s -> 5359.21s]  Tires.
[5363.45s -> 5365.61s]  I don't think you can do that with a car.
[5368.09s -> 5376.98s]  That's it for the door, right?
[5379.88s -> 5381.56s]  You can't do that either.
[5381.56s -> 5382.68s]  That's true.
[5382.68s -> 5383.32s]  Or this.
[5384.44s -> 5399.67s]  Are you serious?
[5399.67s -> 5400.55s]  I can't lift it with this.
[5403.70s -> 5404.98s]  No one is making my life hard.
[5411.58s -> 5413.02s]  Physics damage on the car.
[5413.02s -> 5413.74s]  Impressive.
[5421.06s -> 5421.62s]  God damn it.
[5421.62s -> 5422.10s]  I was gonna...
[5422.66s -> 5432.44s]  This is what a windshield is like, huh?
[5432.44s -> 5433.90s]  Okay, ready?
[5446.10s -> 5447.46s]  Whoa, underneath.
[5447.46s -> 5450.94s]  I was trying...
[5450.94s -> 5451.66s]  Never mind.
[5451.66s -> 5456.89s]  Do I need to pull this?
[5456.89s -> 5457.45s]  That...
[5457.45s -> 5458.81s]  All right, that doesn't break.
[5458.81s -> 5459.78s]  Let's get onto the hood.
[5466.36s -> 5473.05s]  All right, turn it on.
[5473.05s -> 5476.54s]  Let me see if I can find out what the problem is.
[5481.64s -> 5481.96s]  Yeah.
[5484.07s -> 5491.61s]  Let me get a better look.
[5491.61s -> 5492.89s]  I think it might be the battery.
[5497.48s -> 5499.32s]  Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[5499.32s -> 5501.56s]  Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[5501.56s -> 5502.44s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[5503.00s -> 5503.80s]  Give me some juice.
[5512.15s -> 5513.43s]  Ah, no, it's not the battery.
[5513.43s -> 5516.06s]  I think it's the radiator.
[5516.06s -> 5517.58s]  Oh, oh, hot, hot, hot.
[5518.62s -> 5519.18s]  Okay.
[5519.18s -> 5520.30s]  No more hot joke.
[5524.63s -> 5525.43s]  How is this still on?
[5525.99s -> 5530.92s]  There's no way it's still on.
[5539.42s -> 5540.54s]  There's no way this is still on.
[5551.35s -> 5552.55s]  Somebody getting in.
[5552.55s -> 5553.67s]  Let me get in there and see.
[5554.63s -> 5558.15s]  Yeah, it looks like there's a couple of issues here with your glue gun.
[5559.19s -> 5565.66s]  Um, what did I just do?
[5566.54s -> 5570.07s]  Oh, that's the...
[5571.43s -> 5572.87s]  Oh, this is where you pilot the car.
[5572.87s -> 5573.19s]  Right.
[5573.99s -> 5574.79s]  What the fuck?
[5575.75s -> 5584.97s]  I think that's it.
[5585.53s -> 5586.65s]  Did the dash come out?
[5587.85s -> 5591.77s]  I want to see if the car will still run after all this.
[5592.73s -> 5594.25s]  Oh, a crystal.
[5594.89s -> 5598.30s]  Blue crystal.
[5599.10s -> 5607.26s]  A dragon egg.
[5608.14s -> 5620.81s]  All right, I'm going to have to get some tools here in a second.
[5621.61s -> 5630.94s]  Wait.
[5645.80s -> 5648.12s]  Ah, hold on.
[5672.12s -> 5673.32s]  Why did that?
[5675.00s -> 5675.96s]  I can't back it up.
[5677.08s -> 5678.84s]  This is fucking Nintendo Labo.
[5679.56s -> 5682.25s]  Oh, broke my headline.
[5682.25s -> 5682.65s]  Oh, no.
[5683.37s -> 5685.66s]  Jesus Christ.
[5699.43s -> 5699.75s]  Get...
[5701.27s -> 5706.41s]  I need to get a glass.
[5706.41s -> 5719.72s]  That worked.
[5719.72s -> 5722.95s]  Get the back fin here.
[5722.95s -> 5725.82s]  What have we got?
[5725.82s -> 5726.94s]  72 more parts.
[5726.94s -> 5728.46s]  Holy God, are you kidding me?
[5728.46s -> 5729.34s]  Wait, did I fail it?
[5730.22s -> 5730.62s]  No.
[5730.62s -> 5732.70s]  Okay, I didn't know if it exploded was a fail.
[5738.87s -> 5741.27s]  Anything more to the seats besides just the seat?
[5742.07s -> 5746.76s]  Nice, like, gamer chair.
[5747.32s -> 5752.22s]  Wait a minute.
[5752.22s -> 5755.50s]  Is a gamer chair just a car chair?
[5759.06s -> 5759.46s]  It is.
[5760.10s -> 5767.38s]  What?
[5769.40s -> 5770.28s]  It is, isn't it?
[5777.46s -> 5778.26s]  Okay.
[5778.26s -> 5782.46s]  All right, down here.
[5782.46s -> 5784.62s]  All right, I'm going to have to stand up for the next few
[5784.62s -> 5787.02s]  because I'm actually getting motion sick sitting here doing this.
[5787.74s -> 5791.14s]  After we're done with the car, I'm going to have to stretch
[5791.14s -> 5792.50s]  and I'm going to stand up and move the camera
[5792.50s -> 5793.70s]  because I'm actually going to throw up.
[5794.66s -> 5795.38s]  It's just like this...
[5797.21s -> 5798.73s]  Oh, no, I got to get up.
[5800.28s -> 5801.48s]  I got to get out of this chair.
[5805.88s -> 5807.40s]  Movement without movement is just...
[5808.44s -> 5809.00s]  You're going to hurl.
[5814.79s -> 5815.83s]  And plus, this is like...
[5816.87s -> 5820.47s]  I'm spinning around and coiling myself up like a snake.
[5821.19s -> 5833.62s]  Get this out of here.
[5834.34s -> 5841.54s]  Both mufflers?
[5842.63s -> 5843.11s]  Goodbye?
[5843.83s -> 5848.34s]  I think I got to unscrew some shit.
[5850.20s -> 5850.84s]  I think so.
[5851.56s -> 5855.11s]  Can I move the car back?
[5855.11s -> 5857.64s]  All right, no, I got to stand up.
[5862.90s -> 5863.46s]  Hold on.
[5864.10s -> 5864.74s]  I'm going to puke.
[5865.38s -> 5869.11s]  I'm going back to standing.
[5869.11s -> 5875.67s]  This is a failed experiment.
[5876.55s -> 5877.03s]  Okay.
[5877.03s -> 5877.99s]  All right.
[5877.99s -> 5898.73s]  I'm going to move the camera.
[5898.73s -> 5901.94s]  Yeah, I got to move around.
[5901.94s -> 5907.19s]  How are we looking?
[5907.19s -> 5907.99s]  That's all right.
[5907.99s -> 5917.69s]  Maybe a little bit lower.
[5917.69s -> 5922.49s]  Maybe a whole sleeve of Oreos will make you feel better.
[5922.49s -> 5924.01s]  That's not a bad fucking idea.
[5924.49s -> 5925.53s]  That's not a bad idea.
[5925.53s -> 5928.58s]  Like an entire sleeve?
[5929.30s -> 5930.74s]  A little bit more head room.
[5938.12s -> 5939.40s]  All right, let's get untangled.
[5939.40s -> 5942.71s]  This, I feel better already from standing up.
[5943.35s -> 5943.51s]  Good.
[5943.51s -> 5944.15s]  Very good.
[5944.71s -> 5950.47s]  It's a bit?
[5950.47s -> 5950.87s]  What's a bit?
[5950.87s -> 5965.34s]  I'm not joking.
[5965.34s -> 5967.19s]  Do you think I'm joking?
[5967.83s -> 5969.03s]  No, I'm holding back puke.
[5969.75s -> 5971.00s]  I'm kidding.
[5971.00s -> 5971.56s]  I'm kidding.
[5971.56s -> 5972.04s]  I'm kidding.
[5972.04s -> 5979.62s]  Ah!
[5979.62s -> 5980.58s]  All right.
[5980.58s -> 5982.50s]  Better.
[5982.50s -> 5983.78s]  Let's keep doing this shit.
[5983.78s -> 5984.52s]  I feel better now.
[5984.52s -> 5985.08s]  Already.
[5985.08s -> 5986.47s]  Better already.
[5987.19s -> 5988.47s]  I don't even know what I picked up.
[5989.51s -> 5997.10s]  Let's get this shit out.
[5997.10s -> 6009.69s]  So this is a, uh, this is a, no, wrench.
[6010.25s -> 6014.82s]  No, wrench.
[6015.90s -> 6016.54s]  Wrench, right?
[6016.54s -> 6017.18s]  Get back here.
[6017.98s -> 6020.26s]  Flyers or wrench?
[6020.26s -> 6020.58s]  Wrench.
[6021.22s -> 6028.17s]  Can I do it with flyers?
[6028.17s -> 6028.41s]  No.
[6032.89s -> 6038.04s]  Upcap.
[6038.76s -> 6047.29s]  I think I need the, uh, yeah, I need the, although sitting down, you don't do that.
[6047.85s -> 6051.80s]  It's a brake lock.
[6053.32s -> 6058.30s]  Nice.
[6064.87s -> 6067.03s]  Give me the, uh, give me the, uh, yeah.
[6067.03s -> 6071.69s]  Down with you.
[6071.69s -> 6072.89s]  I think that's it with here.
[6074.20s -> 6074.84s]  Oh my God.
[6074.84s -> 6075.48s]  What's going on?
[6076.12s -> 6078.57s]  People giving community subs?
[6080.12s -> 6081.40s]  Uh, pixel bike.
[6081.40s -> 6082.68s]  Thanks for five community subs.
[6082.68s -> 6084.04s]  There was another one before that I missed.
[6086.46s -> 6087.02s]  Big subs.
[6087.02s -> 6087.74s]  Thanks a lot, guys.
[6090.28s -> 6093.91s]  I missed, uh, probably a couple that came in, but thank you.
[6099.69s -> 6100.65s]  Oh, Pogchamp.
[6101.77s -> 6102.73s]  No, thanks a lot, guys.
[6104.98s -> 6106.66s]  More community subs coming in.
[6110.34s -> 6112.41s]  That's what I wanted.
[6112.41s -> 6123.34s]  Throw it off.
[6123.34s -> 6126.57s]  These can come off now.
[6126.57s -> 6129.48s]  All right, now we're just down to, like, the meat of the car.
[6130.20s -> 6135.67s]  Dude, why, why doesn't, like, the gamer chair companies make this?
[6136.63s -> 6139.83s]  It's a double gamer chair.
[6140.39s -> 6143.74s]  Do they make this?
[6145.85s -> 6147.37s]  A gamer couch.
[6155.18s -> 6156.46s]  A gamer couch.
[6160.30s -> 6161.58s]  Uh, what else is free?
[6161.58s -> 6162.06s]  Anything else?
[6162.06s -> 6163.02s]  I got to just do the tires.
[6163.99s -> 6165.43s]  Uh, do all four tires.
[6165.43s -> 6166.07s]  Get it over with.
[6175.29s -> 6178.42s]  Wink.
[6178.42s -> 6182.38s]  I use the crowbar.
[6183.02s -> 6184.89s]  Pull the shit up.
[6189.00s -> 6189.56s]  Brake pad.
[6191.56s -> 6195.10s]  Uh, it's a turn device.
[6195.10s -> 6195.66s]  Whatever it is.
[6197.53s -> 6199.61s]  Now, how do we get this shit off?
[6200.41s -> 6203.83s]  A wrench for that one?
[6204.55s -> 6207.48s]  Is this connected to something?
[6207.48s -> 6212.34s]  I'm not sure what this is exactly connected to.
[6212.34s -> 6213.46s]  I think I have to get rid of this first.
[6214.26s -> 6216.06s]  I think.
[6216.70s -> 6218.87s]  Let's find out.
[6223.43s -> 6223.93s]  Hmm.
[6226.02s -> 6226.52s]  Shit.
[6231.29s -> 6232.25s]  Is there a screw here?
[6233.80s -> 6234.76s]  I don't think so.
[6234.76s -> 6236.36s]  I think it's just wedged in up here.
[6242.87s -> 6243.37s]  Crowbar?
[6244.07s -> 6249.72s]  I don't know.
[6249.72s -> 6250.22s]  Chainsaw.
[6255.88s -> 6258.42s]  Uh, I'm gonna flip the car upside down.
[6261.74s -> 6266.31s]  What's that?
[6266.31s -> 6267.83s]  Why is there, like, why is it leaking?
[6268.87s -> 6270.31s]  All right, this is connected to here.
[6274.36s -> 6274.84s]  There we go.
[6275.99s -> 6277.11s]  Can I pull these off?
[6277.11s -> 6277.59s]  Yeah, I can.
[6284.76s -> 6285.80s]  No, I cannot.
[6287.26s -> 6288.30s]  Said tool required.
[6289.02s -> 6293.59s]  Maybe not.
[6295.77s -> 6297.13s]  We'll find out later.
[6297.13s -> 6301.38s]  I think I can rip this out with the wrench.
[6302.49s -> 6303.21s]  No.
[6303.21s -> 6307.37s]  All right, let's go for gold here.
[6308.89s -> 6309.39s]  Never mind.
[6310.01s -> 6319.85s]  Will you please just pick it up?
[6321.93s -> 6322.97s]  I'm about to do it lefty.
[6324.23s -> 6326.15s]  You ever see somebody hold out javelin like this?
[6326.87s -> 6337.75s]  Just get away from me, please!
[6338.55s -> 6348.71s]  All right, tool to rip this off.
[6348.71s -> 6349.21s]  Got it.
[6349.59s -> 6355.45s]  I can pull these up now.
[6356.09s -> 6356.89s]  Very nice.
[6360.62s -> 6362.46s]  This is bolted somehow.
[6362.46s -> 6362.96s]  Or is it?
[6366.17s -> 6367.93s]  Okay, I did think I was gonna be able to do that.
[6369.74s -> 6371.62s]  All right, now I can flip it back around.
[6372.42s -> 6379.22s]  What's left?
[6379.22s -> 6380.26s]  33 pieces.
[6380.26s -> 6381.62s]  I might have to take the whole engine apart.
[6382.26s -> 6395.53s]  All right, this is the, this is the orbit.
[6395.53s -> 6396.89s]  This is the tuba.
[6397.85s -> 6400.90s]  Okay, don't tell me you didn't blow into the top of that thing.
[6400.90s -> 6402.82s]  It wouldn't make like four separate weird noises.
[6407.78s -> 6413.40s]  You can probably harmonize with that thing with one note.
[6416.06s -> 6418.36s]  All right, engine.
[6419.00s -> 6420.12s]  Engine is detached.
[6420.68s -> 6422.22s]  So it's a big staple.
[6423.67s -> 6424.55s]  Now, here we go.
[6425.27s -> 6431.08s]  I think there's more to meets the eye here with this thing.
[6432.12s -> 6433.69s]  Maybe not.
[6440.79s -> 6441.29s]  Tires.
[6441.83s -> 6446.10s]  And then we gotta go searching for the next little bit here.
[6449.85s -> 6452.66s]  In a minute.
[6452.66s -> 6459.62s]  Oh, I got the turkey leg.
[6460.26s -> 6467.13s]  That's it.
[6468.41s -> 6470.18s]  The meowing engine.
[6470.82s -> 6471.54s]  Is it meowing?
[6475.93s -> 6478.01s]  All right, only a few more things left, I think.
[6478.01s -> 6479.61s]  Yeah, we're down to like the last little bit here.
[6480.33s -> 6486.15s]  It's the two tires.
[6489.83s -> 6490.33s]  Lovely.
[6490.95s -> 6496.15s]  You can get that off.
[6496.15s -> 6498.39s]  Does this have to, does this come apart?
[6498.39s -> 6500.87s]  Oh shit, it does.
[6500.87s -> 6501.75s]  I don't even know if this is.
[6503.11s -> 6505.35s]  How would you go back together?
[6508.15s -> 6508.87s]  Oh my god.
[6509.98s -> 6510.78s]  Get out of my way.
[6513.30s -> 6521.02s]  There's the, there's the rumor.
[6521.58s -> 6522.76s]  All right, here we go.
[6522.76s -> 6523.40s]  Yeah, this is it.
[6523.40s -> 6524.28s]  I got it.
[6524.28s -> 6524.78s]  Victory.
[6527.50s -> 6528.54s]  And other tire right here.
[6533.69s -> 6536.15s]  Finally took long enough.
[6539.67s -> 6540.63s]  19 minutes.
[6546.30s -> 6547.26s]  We did it, Reddit.
[6549.64s -> 6551.16s]  We did it, Reddit.
[6551.16s -> 6552.79s]  All right, what else we got?
[6553.59s -> 6554.55s]  It's Titanic.
[6555.96s -> 6559.24s]  Car, airplane, toaster, coffee grinder.
[6560.20s -> 6562.94s]  Train, deep tank.
[6563.74s -> 6570.04s]  I kind of want to, what do you think?
[6571.70s -> 6572.98s]  Go back to the Titanic.
[6573.54s -> 6580.22s]  I need to like stretch.
[6581.18s -> 6582.62s]  My body is so broken.
[6584.65s -> 6585.15s]  All right.
[6586.81s -> 6593.34s]  How do I, okay, I'm going to say like we're going to pull the bottom out.
[6593.90s -> 6597.34s]  I think that's the most reliable.
[6597.34s -> 6598.30s]  Just rip the bottom out.
[6598.30s -> 6601.50s]  Just take the napkin from underneath all the shit and it'll all fall down.
[6602.14s -> 6604.03s]  Watch this.
[6612.01s -> 6613.37s]  Down, down, down, down, down.
[6613.37s -> 6616.97s]  And what is in here?
[6617.05s -> 6618.25s]  Is it like the engine room?
[6618.25s -> 6619.37s]  All right, I'm going to take the bottom.
[6619.37s -> 6620.49s]  I'm just going to pull the bottom out.
[6621.29s -> 6623.85s]  I'm just going to take one piece.
[6627.08s -> 6628.04s]  Right like down here.
[6628.04s -> 6629.08s]  I'm just going to rip the whole thing.
[6629.88s -> 6630.38s]  Ready?
[6638.33s -> 6638.83s]  Almost.
[6646.34s -> 6647.54s]  Fucking explosions, man.
[6647.54s -> 6648.58s]  They're so intense.
[6653.34s -> 6654.38s]  It's that easy.
[6655.10s -> 6658.46s]  Or is it?
[6659.02s -> 6662.68s]  I might have to go to the bottom of the ocean and clean this and rip these apart.
[6663.32s -> 6668.84s]  Well, that would be a pain in the ass, wouldn't it?
[6671.08s -> 6675.75s]  God damn it.
[6676.71s -> 6681.30s]  I got to turn the thing on.
[6681.30s -> 6682.26s]  That makes me move faster.
[6682.74s -> 6687.77s]  This bubble's just too big.
[6693.51s -> 6694.87s]  Damn it, it's like a gunshot.
[6695.67s -> 6705.61s]  Pick it up.
[6705.61s -> 6706.49s]  Grab it, grab it, grab it.
[6708.49s -> 6710.97s]  Now, I don't know if I'm going to be able to...
[6710.97s -> 6712.41s]  This is going to take so long.
[6716.30s -> 6717.02s]  How would you not do...
[6717.02s -> 6719.50s]  How would you do this without like a fucking grenade?
[6720.62s -> 6725.85s]  Oh, 144 parts.
[6725.85s -> 6728.97s]  I got to go in and disassemble every stool.
[6732.02s -> 6733.48s]  Oh, there it goes.
[6734.20s -> 6742.73s]  143.
[6742.73s -> 6743.29s]  What's it going to do?
[6744.09s -> 6760.04s]  I got to go in and take out everything.
[6760.04s -> 6769.18s]  All right, give me the super speed.
[6770.94s -> 6778.97s]  This is going to take forever.
[6780.01s -> 6783.66s]  Because the thing is, if you try to destroy it one little piece at a time, it just explodes.
[6783.66s -> 6785.66s]  It just goes like, boom!
[6788.46s -> 6801.11s]  I'm just like an anime character blasting through this.
[6802.63s -> 6809.08s]  And here we go!
[6809.80s -> 6823.70s]  I'm just going to go through the middle.
[6823.70s -> 6824.50s]  Watch this, ready?
[6825.54s -> 6826.34s]  I think I did it.
[6826.34s -> 6835.75s]  Kind of.
[6835.75s -> 6836.31s]  Fuck.
[6836.79s -> 6837.67s]  Kind of.
[6837.67s -> 6840.89s]  Fuck.
[6840.89s -> 6850.42s]  Here we go.
[6878.23s -> 6879.19s]  Sorry!
[6879.19s -> 6881.85s]  I can't stop!
[6886.89s -> 6887.77s]  Oh!
[6887.77s -> 6889.38s]  Can it be done?
[6901.58s -> 6903.98s]  Oh my god, I have 109.
[6916.55s -> 6918.98s]  I'm going to explode.
[6919.70s -> 6926.20s]  I am never going to be able to do this.
[6926.84s -> 6929.80s]  Would you touch anything?
[6931.30s -> 6932.42s]  I'm going to destroy these things.
[6935.29s -> 6935.85s]  No, I'm not!
[6935.85s -> 6938.73s]  Oh, it's taking like 20 minutes when I make my way over there.
[6955.67s -> 6963.62s]  No, just gravity gun.
[6969.99s -> 6971.59s]  It's just, it's too wedged in.
[6972.23s -> 6982.47s]  All right, fuck it.
[6983.59s -> 6984.47s]  I can't do this one.
[6984.47s -> 6986.31s]  It's going to take like two hours to do this.
[6986.95s -> 6988.98s]  I'm just going to suck it up.
[7004.26s -> 7026.97s]  I feel like I'm in the middle of that mission in Half-Life when you first
[7026.97s -> 7031.64s]  roll the cart into the electromagnetic spectrum thing.
[7032.76s -> 7039.85s]  This is 70 more times.
[7076.58s -> 7091.93s]  All right, I can't, I'm done.
[7092.57s -> 7096.07s]  I'm done.
[7096.07s -> 7097.69s]  I did it.
[7097.69s -> 7098.01s]  I'm done.
[7106.26s -> 7107.62s]  This is going to actually be the same.
[7117.14s -> 7119.86s]  I have no idea where these other 24 pieces are.
[7129.53s -> 7131.69s]  I know they could be anywhere.
[7131.69s -> 7137.19s]  It's 21.
[7137.19s -> 7138.07s]  I think it could be anywhere.
[7138.07s -> 7139.43s]  It could be any one of these.
[7139.43s -> 7158.38s]  It's 21 still!
[7162.04s -> 7163.08s]  It's not possible.
[7171.50s -> 7173.10s]  Where is the other piece?
[7173.98s -> 7190.25s]  Is there any more?
[7193.99s -> 7194.63s]  Does this count?
[7225.62s -> 7230.31s]  Okay, that's it.
[7230.31s -> 7231.11s]  I'm sorry.
[7231.11s -> 7231.99s]  I don't care.
[7232.71s -> 7234.71s]  I don't care if I get a heart attack on this one.
[7236.66s -> 7238.50s]  My like psyche is going to break down.
[7258.66s -> 7269.37s]  No, no, no, what are you doing?
[7269.37s -> 7270.01s]  No!
[7270.01s -> 7272.66s]  That's not what I wanted.
[7275.45s -> 7280.95s]  Why is this killing me so much?
[7281.51s -> 7289.62s]  Now give me a headache.
[7289.62s -> 7292.18s]  Imagine the guy in the inside.
[7292.18s -> 7295.59s]  I got a headache.
[7295.59s -> 7297.78s]  Oh, it's like times 10 headache.
[7297.78s -> 7307.05s]  My friend says you have a long plantain face.
[7307.05s -> 7309.26s]  Oh, good.
[7309.26s -> 7311.02s]  Isn't it fucking chiseled?
[7311.02s -> 7313.34s]  I just chiseled plantain.
[7313.34s -> 7317.34s]  I don't even know what that means.
[7320.25s -> 7323.42s]  I can't do mind show right now.
[7323.42s -> 7323.82s]  I'm going to...
[7325.98s -> 7326.62s]  Fuck.
[7326.62s -> 7331.83s]  These VR streams are fucking killing me.
[7331.83s -> 7335.59s]  It's like every day I lose.
[7336.46s -> 7340.46s]  Every day I lose a little more energy.
[7340.46s -> 7343.91s]  Doing it like two or three times in a row.
[7343.91s -> 7345.19s]  It's so fun though.
[7345.19s -> 7347.72s]  I think I can do a couple...
[7347.72s -> 7348.52s]  Hold on.
[7348.52s -> 7354.36s]  Plantain's a banana.
[7354.36s -> 7356.41s]  Oh, whatever.
[7356.41s -> 7357.45s]  I've got like a banana face.
[7357.45s -> 7357.85s]  That's fine.
[7361.74s -> 7363.02s]  I want to keep playing that.
[7363.58s -> 7368.20s]  I thought bringing the chair in was going to help.
[7368.76s -> 7370.28s]  I'll bring a chair in and sit out
[7370.28s -> 7372.62s]  and feel like I'm going to throw up.
[7372.70s -> 7374.39s]  It's all right.
[7374.39s -> 7375.43s]  I just need a second.
[7375.43s -> 7376.07s]  We'll go back in.
[7380.15s -> 7381.42s]  Where's my library?
[7385.26s -> 7386.06s]  All right.
[7386.06s -> 7389.10s]  What happened to it?
[7389.10s -> 7390.95s]  There it is.
[7390.95s -> 7391.19s]  Okay.
[7391.19s -> 7391.59s]  Let's go.
[7395.77s -> 7407.00s]  There comes a puking stream.
[7407.00s -> 7409.88s]  Nah, it was just zooming in really fast.
[7410.52s -> 7411.40s]  Sitting down in the chair.
[7420.60s -> 7421.96s]  Blade and Sorcery got a big update.
[7421.96s -> 7422.76s]  Maybe we'll check it out.
[7427.70s -> 7427.94s]  All right.
[7427.94s -> 7428.58s]  Let me get in here.
[7430.02s -> 7430.74s]  Let's do the computer.
[7430.74s -> 7431.62s]  The computer sounds fun.
[7438.15s -> 7438.87s]  I'm going to be honest.
[7440.34s -> 7442.66s]  Any next game in VR is going to be like
[7443.46s -> 7444.26s]  Blade and Sorcery.
[7444.26s -> 7446.26s]  I have to fucking move around and swing around.
[7448.47s -> 7450.55s]  I might not be able to do that for very long.
[7450.55s -> 7454.42s]  I'm getting like that fucking like puke reflex.
[7458.55s -> 7460.15s]  It's from sitting down.
[7460.15s -> 7462.31s]  And you know when you like get that after a while,
[7462.31s -> 7464.71s]  you get that feeling and then like you can't get rid of it.
[7468.60s -> 7469.56s]  Getting up made it better.
[7469.56s -> 7470.12s]  And then like there.
[7473.72s -> 7474.36s]  Oh my God.
[7474.36s -> 7475.80s]  I was being just attacked.
[7476.68s -> 7481.62s]  Let's do the computer.
[7482.18s -> 7487.16s]  Drone, TV, submarine.
[7487.16s -> 7488.20s]  Some of these are so fun.
[7489.78s -> 7490.34s]  Microwave.
[7499.24s -> 7500.20s]  What is happening here?
[7506.97s -> 7508.17s]  Something is not right.
[7511.51s -> 7512.15s]  That's odd.
[7523.96s -> 7525.08s]  Is it like the pizza?
[7529.16s -> 7530.60s]  Did I fry my GPU?
[7531.42s -> 7532.22s]  I don't think so.
[7532.22s -> 7532.54s]  Hold on.
[7534.79s -> 7535.35s]  Oh no.
[7540.82s -> 7541.46s]  Oh no.
[7542.50s -> 7543.38s]  Oh no.
[7544.34s -> 7546.34s]  Now wait.
[7549.74s -> 7550.06s]  Fixed.
[7550.78s -> 7551.18s]  We're good.
[7554.07s -> 7555.11s]  The window wasn't in focus.
[7557.21s -> 7557.85s]  Weirdly enough.
[7558.41s -> 7562.66s]  All right.
[7562.66s -> 7564.26s]  So let's do microwave.
[7564.26s -> 7566.97s]  We've got 113 pieces.
[7566.97s -> 7567.29s]  Let's see.
[7567.29s -> 7568.49s]  Let's cook something.
[7568.49s -> 7594.89s]  You're not supposed to put metal in the microwave.
[7601.58s -> 7602.78s]  Why is it not doing anything?
[7615.50s -> 7628.74s]  We're going to eat good tonight.
[7628.74s -> 7663.27s]  I can't put my head in here.
[7663.27s -> 7669.86s]  Okay.
[7671.05s -> 7671.61s]  Jesus.
[7671.61s -> 7671.85s]  All right.
[7671.85s -> 7672.49s]  Let's try it again.
[7684.66s -> 7688.10s]  Why is everything so fragile in this game?
[7688.10s -> 7688.50s]  Seriously.
[7688.50s -> 7688.98s]  Look at this.
[7688.98s -> 7689.46s]  Ready?
[7689.46s -> 7689.94s]  Watch this.
[7692.57s -> 7694.41s]  It's just a piece of lettuce.
[7694.41s -> 7695.70s]  There's a piece of lettuce.
[7697.14s -> 7698.58s]  Well, the plating is very important.
[7698.58s -> 7701.06s]  You've got to make sure you put your greens
[7701.06s -> 7702.82s]  right gently on the plate.
[7702.82s -> 7703.54s]  Oh, whoops.
[7703.54s -> 7704.50s]  It fucking broke.
[7724.04s -> 7725.16s]  Just restart it.
[7725.16s -> 7727.45s]  God damn it.
[7727.45s -> 7729.46s]  All right.
[7729.46s -> 7730.26s]  Forget about this.
[7730.26s -> 7731.30s]  We're going to open it up.
[7731.30s -> 7733.22s]  What does the microwave even look like inside?
[7733.94s -> 7735.51s]  Probably scary.
[7736.23s -> 7739.29s]  How terrifying is a microwave?
[7741.56s -> 7742.44s]  Microwave the gun.
[7764.15s -> 7764.63s]  I did it.
[7765.75s -> 7767.75s]  The door wasn't shut all the way.
[7768.55s -> 7778.50s]  Hold on.
[7778.50s -> 7794.97s]  Cooking with Jerma.
[7794.97s -> 7795.29s]  What?
[7795.85s -> 7802.60s]  I guess I'll have a pizza.
[7804.70s -> 7805.66s]  Oh, it broke.
[7806.06s -> 7811.46s]  What's going on?
[7811.46s -> 7819.37s]  All right.
[7819.37s -> 7824.74s]  I'm going to do it for real this time.
[7824.74s -> 7826.02s]  I broke the pizza.
[7827.83s -> 7828.15s]  All right.
[7829.46s -> 7832.49s]  Panel, door, back panel.
[7832.49s -> 7837.14s]  Can I get this again?
[7837.14s -> 7837.94s]  I got screws here.
[7838.90s -> 7842.92s]  Oh, I'm going to move way too fast.
[7842.92s -> 7848.95s]  There we go.
[7848.95s -> 7851.19s]  This little room, you can't go that fast.
[7851.19s -> 7852.55s]  So let's open this up.
[7865.03s -> 7865.91s]  This one's going to be cool.
[7866.63s -> 7866.95s]  All right.
[7867.91s -> 7869.35s]  Can I get this back panel off?
[7870.65s -> 7870.81s]  No.
[7870.81s -> 7871.69s]  How do I get that down?
[7879.11s -> 7879.35s]  No.
[7880.55s -> 7880.87s]  Hold on.
[7880.87s -> 7881.35s]  Uh-oh.
[7881.35s -> 7906.31s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7906.31s -> 7906.95s]  Cool.
[7906.95s -> 7907.91s]  That's it for the panel.
[7912.78s -> 7913.26s]  Holy shit.
[7913.26s -> 7913.90s]  That's what it looks like.
[7914.54s -> 7915.59s]  What a weird machine.
[7916.23s -> 7923.43s]  Can I get that screw?
[7924.15s -> 7926.47s]  I can get that screw.
[7927.03s -> 7940.81s]  Is this top not going to come off?
[7940.81s -> 7941.61s]  I got to cut these.
[7944.65s -> 7945.69s]  Get that off here now.
[7947.13s -> 7947.77s]  Oh, shit.
[7947.77s -> 7948.25s]  Oh, shit.
[7948.25s -> 7949.29s]  What did I do?
[7949.29s -> 7950.71s]  Oh, my God.
[7950.71s -> 7951.19s]  What's happening?
[7955.02s -> 7955.90s]  Oh, it was the glass.
[7959.53s -> 7961.77s]  All right.
[7962.82s -> 7963.62s]  Broke right in half.
[7964.42s -> 7967.03s]  Can I get this one out too?
[7967.83s -> 7970.17s]  I don't think I have to.
[7970.81s -> 7973.62s]  Play it out of there.
[7980.49s -> 7981.53s]  Why does it have to load this?
[7982.97s -> 7985.88s]  I'm going to just get out of here.
[7986.60s -> 7991.50s]  This little thing here.
[7992.22s -> 7994.41s]  I think I got to take all these off, don't I?
[7994.41s -> 7994.97s]  Yes, I do.
[8002.46s -> 8006.10s]  Really?
[8006.10s -> 8006.82s]  Come on.
[8006.82s -> 8021.21s]  Does this still work?
[8021.21s -> 8022.01s]  Does this still turn on?
[8025.24s -> 8026.76s]  The door's not on it, so it won't work.
[8032.78s -> 8034.06s]  Might need it later.
[8034.06s -> 8041.50s]  What the fuck is this?
[8042.06s -> 8042.86s]  A bulb?
[8043.74s -> 8044.14s]  Oops.
[8044.70s -> 8045.53s]  Whatever.
[8045.53s -> 8047.05s]  Somebody will clean that up later.
[8050.18s -> 8059.24s]  Every time I go like this, I want you to edit a lightning strike.
[8067.26s -> 8067.82s]  Hmm.
[8067.82s -> 8073.82s]  Screws?
[8076.68s -> 8077.77s]  No.
[8077.77s -> 8078.65s]  Those screws, right?
[8079.29s -> 8095.37s]  Do I got to flip it?
[8095.37s -> 8097.53s]  I think those little tiny things are right there.
[8097.53s -> 8099.96s]  Shit.
[8099.96s -> 8107.67s]  I like the little screwdriver.
[8107.67s -> 8114.79s]  It's never used.
[8114.79s -> 8117.27s]  Only the boss baby one is used.
[8117.27s -> 8118.71s]  I want the little one.
[8118.71s -> 8121.69s]  Let's go back to that.
[8123.34s -> 8124.06s]  Give me the pliers.
[8124.70s -> 8134.38s]  I can't get rid of this shit.
[8134.38s -> 8141.58s]  Look at this.
[8141.58s -> 8149.82s]  All right.
[8149.82s -> 8150.70s]  A little fan came out.
[8151.34s -> 8156.47s]  Can I get this off?
[8164.49s -> 8165.29s]  What was that holding in?
[8165.93s -> 8167.54s]  I was holding this in.
[8168.26s -> 8170.07s]  This piece right here, right?
[8170.71s -> 8177.43s]  Why can't I get this shit off?
[8177.99s -> 8184.30s]  You figured I could get this off with the pliers.
[8191.53s -> 8192.73s]  I don't even know what that's connected to.
[8193.77s -> 8201.16s]  All right.
[8201.16s -> 8201.96s]  Here we go.
[8201.96s -> 8203.94s]  I got a bunch of straight wires.
[8204.50s -> 8212.17s]  Is there a screw?
[8216.25s -> 8216.57s]  Screw?
[8217.21s -> 8222.46s]  Crowbar?
[8222.46s -> 8229.13s]  I think it's too small to put the crowbar in here.
[8229.13s -> 8230.81s]  I'm surprised I can't do these.
[8230.81s -> 8231.93s]  That's not a real table.
[8231.93s -> 8243.13s]  Look at that.
[8243.13s -> 8243.61s]  Oh shit.
[8243.61s -> 8244.49s]  Flip it upside down.
[8245.85s -> 8247.21s]  This is the problem right here.
[8247.21s -> 8248.01s]  Just figuring it out.
[8248.73s -> 8263.06s]  Okay.
[8264.23s -> 8265.19s]  Now what does that do for me?
[8273.59s -> 8273.83s]  What?
[8273.83s -> 8274.15s]  I don't know.
[8274.15s -> 8275.11s]  It just knocks something off.
[8281.53s -> 8283.98s]  I think that's good.
[8286.92s -> 8287.88s]  Can't remove this yet.
[8287.88s -> 8288.52s]  Is this screwed in?
[8293.99s -> 8294.47s]  Nice.
[8295.94s -> 8296.90s]  Now, can I get it off?
[8298.34s -> 8303.24s]  Oh, dick.
[8303.24s -> 8303.96s]  Come on.
[8303.96s -> 8317.75s]  This thing can be...
[8319.91s -> 8321.27s]  That's scaring the fuck out of me.
[8321.27s -> 8321.83s]  Stop doing that.
[8323.69s -> 8324.49s]  What is happening?
[8327.38s -> 8329.06s]  It doesn't like when I pick this up.
[8333.06s -> 8333.38s]  Damn.
[8333.38s -> 8333.62s]  All right.
[8333.62s -> 8334.58s]  This is the middle of there.
[8335.54s -> 8337.88s]  This is where all the radiation comes from?
[8340.57s -> 8340.89s]  All right.
[8340.89s -> 8341.29s]  Let's go...
[8344.58s -> 8348.82s]  I still can't get into there.
[8351.16s -> 8352.84s]  It's not a real table.
[8353.64s -> 8363.70s]  What is holding this thing?
[8363.70s -> 8365.46s]  Electromagnetic radiation.
[8366.10s -> 8373.43s]  I still don't get what's holding all this shit in.
[8374.47s -> 8376.89s]  I guess they're latched in like that.
[8377.61s -> 8381.99s]  Stay there.
[8382.71s -> 8385.85s]  Stop breaking my game.
[8388.71s -> 8390.31s]  I paid good money for this game.
[8390.31s -> 8390.55s]  All right.
[8390.55s -> 8401.40s]  I think we're getting close.
[8403.58s -> 8403.90s]  Six...
[8403.90s -> 8404.70s]  Oh my...
[8404.70s -> 8405.02s]  Wow.
[8405.82s -> 8407.58s]  Did not fix 61 parts.
[8407.58s -> 8408.70s]  This is an intricate one.
[8409.42s -> 8420.20s]  Gotta get in there.
[8420.84s -> 8430.09s]  Yeah.
[8430.09s -> 8431.61s]  After this, we'll play Blade and Sorcery.
[8432.25s -> 8435.85s]  Until I puke and then leave.
[8436.73s -> 8443.32s]  Get your camera ready because there might be a throw-up on camera.
[8443.96s -> 8448.54s]  I think that's good for that.
[8448.54s -> 8457.05s]  It's still being held in.
[8461.77s -> 8462.49s]  By what?
[8476.39s -> 8477.27s]  How do I get rid of this?
[8477.83s -> 8481.21s]  Is there a screw?
[8481.21s -> 8482.33s]  There is a screw, isn't there?
[8493.19s -> 8493.59s]  That it?
[8494.23s -> 8494.55s]  Yes.
[8497.82s -> 8498.70s]  Easy, easy.
[8499.50s -> 8500.81s]  The panel can come off.
[8501.69s -> 8502.01s]  Right?
[8503.46s -> 8504.42s]  Yes, it can.
[8506.31s -> 8506.87s]  Excellent.
[8510.01s -> 8510.89s]  Shake out the excess.
[8514.20s -> 8515.96s]  These are connected to here.
[8516.92s -> 8517.56s]  Ultimately.
[8518.36s -> 8520.42s]  So the question is, how...
[8520.42s -> 8521.78s]  Why can I not unscrew these?
[8522.66s -> 8541.08s]  Fucking hell.
[8541.08s -> 8553.72s]  Is there a screw?
[8555.35s -> 8556.07s]  Help me out here.
[8559.18s -> 8560.14s]  I can't get this.
[8560.78s -> 8562.81s]  I can't get that off.
[8562.81s -> 8566.94s]  Gonna watch wrestling a bit.
[8566.94s -> 8568.38s]  What is going on?
[8568.38s -> 8572.41s]  What is this paragraph?
[8575.42s -> 8576.54s]  What was all over the...
[8577.26s -> 8578.84s]  Wait, what's going on?
[8579.40s -> 8580.28s]  Did I miss something?
[8581.16s -> 8583.27s]  Oh, that was part four?
[8586.87s -> 8588.39s]  There's a nut on the screw.
[8589.43s -> 8589.91s]  Give me the...
[8590.79s -> 8594.14s]  Let me get a good look at this.
[8621.74s -> 8629.06s]  I don't know, man.
[8629.06s -> 8630.02s]  I'm kind of confused.
[8636.54s -> 8637.50s]  Nerd neck.
[8637.50s -> 8639.18s]  I mean, I have to be like this.
[8644.31s -> 8646.15s]  You unlock tools by completing levels.
[8649.08s -> 8650.92s]  So the more level packs you complete,
[8650.92s -> 8651.88s]  the more stuff you get.
[8652.52s -> 8656.65s]  I'm kind of stuck here though.
[8659.50s -> 8660.78s]  Because these can't...
[8660.78s -> 8661.58s]  You can lift these up.
[8664.79s -> 8667.70s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[8667.70s -> 8673.29s]  Wait a minute.
[8673.29s -> 8674.01s]  Give me the pliers.
[8680.79s -> 8681.19s]  Come on.
[8684.82s -> 8685.06s]  Fuck.
[8687.88s -> 8688.36s]  No.
[8692.09s -> 8693.37s]  What the hell is this?
[8693.37s -> 8703.90s]  Can I take this off?
[8705.30s -> 8706.02s]  Oh, shit.
[8707.22s -> 8711.10s]  I think I can pull back panel off.
[8715.24s -> 8715.56s]  Come on.
[8715.56s -> 8716.76s]  That was a eureka moment.
[8716.76s -> 8717.00s]  Why?
[8717.80s -> 8721.54s]  Oh, you're kidding me.
[8721.54s -> 8721.78s]  What?
[8726.94s -> 8727.26s]  Shit.
[8728.14s -> 8732.71s]  Is that a screw?
[8735.88s -> 8742.18s]  I don't know.
[8742.18s -> 8743.14s]  I can't tell if it's a screw.
[8752.86s -> 8753.10s]  No.
[8761.43s -> 8774.34s]  Ah, babe, I'm stumped.
[8774.34s -> 8775.78s]  Because I can't get in here
[8775.78s -> 8776.74s]  and undo these.
[8777.30s -> 8786.10s]  See what I mean?
[8791.02s -> 8792.30s]  Ah, there we go.
[8793.02s -> 8793.82s]  I did it.
[8793.82s -> 8800.84s]  I figured it out.
[8800.84s -> 8801.32s]  Yes.
[8803.03s -> 8803.91s]  Lovely.
[8803.91s -> 8805.03s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[8805.03s -> 8808.33s]  Okay, let's get this out of here now.
[8809.21s -> 8812.47s]  Take it all apart.
[8812.47s -> 8814.07s]  Fantastic.
[8816.12s -> 8816.44s]  Flop.
[8818.10s -> 8820.50s]  And this is still connected somehow to something.
[8821.54s -> 8822.98s]  What is this connected to?
[8829.22s -> 8830.34s]  Nothing's even plugged in here.
[8830.90s -> 8832.73s]  These are all just straight wires.
[8838.06s -> 8839.02s]  I can't get under there.
[8839.66s -> 8846.44s]  Nothing's even attached.
[8847.40s -> 8848.20s]  It's just floating.
[8850.01s -> 8852.41s]  Do I have to grab it with the pliers?
[8858.57s -> 8860.31s]  I'm going to throw it out the window.
[8860.31s -> 8861.11s]  Oh, it's been too long.
[8861.11s -> 8861.59s]  Don't do that.
[8862.31s -> 8874.76s]  All right, this doesn't make any sense
[8874.76s -> 8875.88s]  in the laws of physics.
[8876.60s -> 8893.19s]  Is that a tiny little screw?
[8895.05s -> 8895.29s]  No.
[8903.64s -> 8905.32s]  Every connector needs to be disconnected.
[8905.88s -> 8906.28s]  They're not?
[8906.92s -> 8923.86s]  I mean, what is disconnected on this one?
[8923.86s -> 8924.42s]  I can't even tell.
[8932.79s -> 8937.40s]  Ah, no.
[8946.89s -> 8947.29s]  Oh my god.
[8947.29s -> 8948.49s]  There's another one of these fucking things.
[8949.29s -> 8955.88s]  Look at this hidden ass screw.
[8955.88s -> 8958.33s]  Are you serious?
[8958.33s -> 8959.93s]  It was like stuffed in here.
[8959.93s -> 8965.94s]  Are there any more like hidden screws?
[8965.94s -> 8967.14s]  This still can't come off.
[8968.84s -> 8970.76s]  What?
[8970.76s -> 8971.32s]  Why?
[8971.32s -> 8972.84s]  I'm getting inside of here.
[8972.84s -> 8975.24s]  There it is.
[8975.24s -> 8977.29s]  Right here.
[8977.29s -> 8978.01s]  All right, come on.
[8978.73s -> 8980.09s]  Oh, thank god.
[8981.91s -> 8982.39s]  Jesus.
[8982.95s -> 8984.87s]  That took an eternity.
[8985.83s -> 8986.79s]  I'm going to get out of my face.
[8987.51s -> 8990.84s]  Now, how do I?
[8990.84s -> 9005.56s]  Ah, 38 pieces.
[9006.20s -> 9009.34s]  I'm about to shoot it with the gun.
[9009.34s -> 9020.14s]  I need to get in here.
[9020.14s -> 9027.11s]  The bottom right panel needs to be pulled out.
[9027.11s -> 9030.52s]  I mean, is there some magic hidden screw?
[9030.92s -> 9031.80s]  That I didn't get?
[9032.44s -> 9035.32s]  You know what I'm saying?
[9035.88s -> 9041.21s]  There's going to be some one fucking screw
[9042.01s -> 9043.22s]  that I didn't get.
[9043.86s -> 9049.10s]  Is that it?
[9049.10s -> 9051.43s]  I can't even tell.
[9052.79s -> 9057.77s]  Screw on the top?
[9080.26s -> 9080.98s]  That's not a...
[9080.98s -> 9082.74s]  These, they look like phantom screws.
[9083.46s -> 9084.42s]  These aren't even real.
[9085.94s -> 9090.25s]  You see, that's already been unscrewed.
[9090.25s -> 9091.05s]  I think.
[9091.05s -> 9091.61s]  I don't know.
[9092.49s -> 9099.51s]  Look at the side opposite the wires.
[9100.23s -> 9101.43s]  Damn, Jerma.
[9101.43s -> 9145.35s]  It's like you've never disassembled a microwave before.
[9146.55s -> 9147.35s]  Oh, that hurt.
[9148.07s -> 9149.27s]  It's like you've never...
[9149.27s -> 9151.18s]  Oh, that was good.
[9151.18s -> 9152.55s]  That was a good one.
[9156.25s -> 9157.05s]  What the fuck, man?
[9157.77s -> 9158.97s]  Oh, this is not it?
[9158.97s -> 9160.74s]  I thought that was a screw right here.
[9161.62s -> 9166.26s]  Oh my god, you're killing me.
[9166.98s -> 9168.10s]  Where is this?
[9168.10s -> 9172.42s]  I keep thinking it's here, but it's not, right?
[9179.18s -> 9179.74s]  Oh my god.
[9179.74s -> 9180.38s]  Oh my god.
[9180.38s -> 9181.98s]  I keep thinking it's here, but it's not, right?
[9187.40s -> 9189.24s]  I can't like get into here
[9189.24s -> 9191.48s]  to like get out of this thing out of here.
[9192.20s -> 9213.86s]  There's nothing even in there.
[9215.13s -> 9216.57s]  There's nothing even in there.
[9223.26s -> 9243.61s]  Screw in the center?
[9244.57s -> 9275.72s]  I need a better angle.
[9280.26s -> 9281.14s]  Mom walks in.
[9281.78s -> 9284.63s]  Jeffrey, what the fuck are you doing?
[9285.56s -> 9286.44s]  I'm sorry, mom.
[9295.29s -> 9299.78s]  I thought we were going to go to the hospital.
[9301.62s -> 9305.94s]  Jeffrey fucking scrapped up his face and got a black eye.
[9305.94s -> 9308.90s]  I'm trying to take apart the microwave.
[9315.16s -> 9315.96s]  Give it to me.
[9320.71s -> 9330.46s]  Press the life alert.
[9340.31s -> 9388.12s]  No, that's...
[9388.12s -> 9388.76s]  Are you sure?
[9391.56s -> 9401.96s]  Where'd it go?
[9401.96s -> 9405.96s]  Where did it go?
[9406.60s -> 9407.08s]  Where'd it go?
[9407.80s -> 9408.76s]  Right there.
[9408.76s -> 9423.10s]  That's not it.
[9423.10s -> 9423.74s]  I don't know.
[9424.73s -> 9425.61s]  I can't do it.
[9425.61s -> 9427.13s]  I don't know where the last little...
[9427.13s -> 9429.96s]  I gotta pull this apart.
[9429.96s -> 9430.76s]  Wait a minute.
[9430.76s -> 9447.14s]  Damn it.
[9447.14s -> 9447.70s]  I'm stinking.
[9522.50s -> 9523.46s]  Micro wheel.
[9524.49s -> 9524.73s]  No.
[9525.37s -> 9533.93s]  Make sure the connector on the wires is disconnected.
[9549.66s -> 9551.66s]  Is it in the north corner?
[9551.66s -> 9559.72s]  Please for the love of god try the bottom connectors on the motor.
[9560.28s -> 9561.56s]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[9562.28s -> 9563.32s]  I can't get them.
[9565.26s -> 9566.70s]  I tried like five times.
[9567.50s -> 9577.38s]  See like they can only go back this far and I can't do anything with it.
[9578.02s -> 9582.66s]  You stupid fucking game.
[9582.66s -> 9583.94s]  Are you serious right now?
[9589.80s -> 9591.08s]  I did it.
[9591.08s -> 9599.48s]  You just gotta get your whole head in here.
[9599.48s -> 9600.20s]  I didn't even do it.
[9602.68s -> 9603.56s]  That didn't do anything.
[9605.64s -> 9607.40s]  No, it didn't do anything.
[9607.40s -> 9625.37s]  No, what was that screw for?
[9625.37s -> 9646.30s]  What was it for?
[9646.30s -> 9647.50s]  Middle inner microwave.
[9648.06s -> 9682.94s]  I'm going in.
[9682.94s -> 9683.74s]  Other side.
[9686.46s -> 9694.86s]  I can't even get the damn panel off.
[9695.58s -> 9698.78s]  I think I give up.
[9703.30s -> 9706.02s]  I can't like reliably get my fucking hands in here.
[9763.69s -> 9799.06s]  No, no, that was it.
[9799.06s -> 9799.86s]  That was the end.
[9800.98s -> 9801.62s]  That was it.
[9802.62s -> 9803.02s]  What happened?
[9803.02s -> 9803.58s]  What's wrong?
[9809.05s -> 9809.53s]  What happened?
[9809.53s -> 9810.97s]  What's wrong here?
[9810.97s -> 9818.82s]  Just unscrew the side panel.
[9818.82s -> 9820.42s]  What are you talking about?
[9820.42s -> 9822.18s]  I've unscrewed every screw.
[9831.30s -> 9834.79s]  There's nothing holding this shit.
[9834.79s -> 9836.47s]  There's nothing here anymore.
[9836.47s -> 9845.72s]  What the?
[9845.72s -> 9846.04s]  What?
[9847.62s -> 9848.18s]  What?
[9848.26s -> 9849.94s]  This is just floating in midair.
[9866.78s -> 9867.90s]  Wiggle the connectors.
[9925.42s -> 9940.33s]  Pull the connectors down.
[9941.61s -> 9945.37s]  Aren't they all down already?
[9945.37s -> 9954.01s]  The bottom panel is red.
[9959.69s -> 9960.41s]  Bottom panel.
[9960.41s -> 9961.13s]  Bottom panel.
[9961.77s -> 9964.73s]  Guys, you're talking about right here, right?
[9964.73s -> 9965.77s]  This is what you're talking about.
[9965.77s -> 9966.73s]  Talking about this panel.
[9969.26s -> 9972.09s]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you're talking about.
[9972.09s -> 9972.81s]  Where's the screw?
[9974.33s -> 9974.89s]  Where is it?
[9976.25s -> 9977.05s]  That's not a screw.
[9977.85s -> 9978.89s]  I can't remove this.
[9979.77s -> 9982.50s]  This thing's all fucked up.
[9983.22s -> 9985.59s]  There is no way to remove this.
[10004.62s -> 10005.58s]  Crowbar.
[10005.58s -> 10007.82s]  Don't even tell me it was the crowbar.
[10008.46s -> 10019.56s]  Slide it?
[10019.56s -> 10020.20s]  It's red.
[10020.20s -> 10021.32s]  I can't slide it.
[10022.28s -> 10023.32s]  There is no sliding.
[10023.32s -> 10023.88s]  It's red.
[10025.08s -> 10027.48s]  Something is keeping this here.
[10028.28s -> 10031.19s]  But fuck if I know what the hell it is.
[10044.73s -> 10057.45s]  That's not a screw.
[10057.45s -> 10060.18s]  It's almost like this screw was supposed to be here.
[10060.18s -> 10062.10s]  But it's like a JPG.
[10070.54s -> 10072.62s]  It might be broken like the rice cooker was.
[10073.93s -> 10074.81s]  Hex key?
[10074.81s -> 10076.17s]  No, there's no indicator.
[10077.13s -> 10078.41s]  There's not even an indicator.
[10079.88s -> 10081.24s]  There would be an indicator, watch.
[10082.79s -> 10083.75s]  There's no indicator.
[10086.09s -> 10087.29s]  This thing just doesn't exist.
[10093.30s -> 10095.78s]  Have I really been just scouring this whole thing
[10095.78s -> 10097.86s]  and it just glitched out and I can't even do it?
[10118.95s -> 10119.83s]  Smart click?
[10119.83s -> 10121.67s]  No, there's nothing here to unscrew.
[10122.71s -> 10124.39s]  There really isn't anything to unscrew.
[10138.28s -> 10139.64s]  Looks like that but there's a hole.
[10141.75s -> 10148.97s]  Where's the screw?
[10149.61s -> 10150.25s]  Where's the screw?
[10151.27s -> 10151.91s]  Didn't exist.
[10152.63s -> 10166.76s]  There was no screw.
[10166.76s -> 10176.63s]  That was so long.
[10176.63s -> 10189.77s]  There was no screw.
[10189.77s -> 10193.45s]  I got baited to 45 that it's a microwave prep.
[10194.09s -> 10196.34s]  Let's do the computer.
[10196.34s -> 10227.37s]  Okay, what we got in here?
[10229.99s -> 10232.36s]  DVDs?
[10232.36s -> 10233.16s]  Okay, we got...
[10233.88s -> 10234.84s]  How is there this many parts?
[10234.84s -> 10236.28s]  There's not a hundred parts in a computer.
[10239.93s -> 10240.57s]  There's the brain.
[10240.57s -> 10241.53s]  We'll see.
[10241.53s -> 10256.78s]  Here's the...
[10256.78s -> 10258.22s]  Why is the power supply up here?
[10258.94s -> 10260.70s]  Shouldn't the power supply be down here?
[10260.70s -> 10262.86s]  This person installed this upside down.
[10266.74s -> 10267.94s]  It's supposed to look like this.
[10271.56s -> 10278.57s]  But, right?
[10278.57s -> 10281.62s]  Doesn't the power supply just sit on the bottom and the...
[10282.42s -> 10285.50s]  People do a hanging power supply like that?
[10289.08s -> 10291.16s]  They're not even fucking computer experts.
[10291.16s -> 10299.56s]  Okay, there's the little...
[10299.56s -> 10301.61s]  This will all come out sedazy.
[10301.61s -> 10302.33s]  I don't know what that was.
[10303.13s -> 10305.22s]  The heat sink.
[10305.94s -> 10307.19s]  CPU.
[10307.19s -> 10309.11s]  All right, let's get our workstation clean.
[10310.23s -> 10328.17s]  What is that?
[10328.17s -> 10328.81s]  16 gig?
[10329.77s -> 10333.42s]  What, you only got 16 gig in here?
[10334.89s -> 10345.10s]  SSD?
[10345.74s -> 10346.78s]  Nice.
[10346.78s -> 10353.83s]  All right, let's get out of here.
[10353.83s -> 10356.87s]  Is this tool-less?
[10356.87s -> 10358.95s]  Nah, not tool-less, unfortunately.
[10359.51s -> 10376.22s]  It doesn't even have tool-less.
[10376.22s -> 10386.42s]  It makes a cool noise.
[10388.20s -> 10399.27s]  All right, so that graphics card is wedged the fuck in here.
[10399.27s -> 10401.99s]  I don't know who installed this, but they did a terrible job.
[10405.16s -> 10406.04s]  You know, where's the tab?
[10406.84s -> 10413.90s]  I mean, just awful.
[10413.90s -> 10415.10s]  Absolutely awful job.
[10415.74s -> 10434.74s]  If you take this part too, that'd be cool if you take that apart.
[10436.44s -> 10437.96s]  There's the small battery.
[10442.55s -> 10461.53s]  All right.
[10462.79s -> 10463.67s]  Oh, god damn it.
[10468.22s -> 10469.58s]  PC repair shop.
[10471.16s -> 10474.12s]  The guy that covers his hands in oil before he touches it.
[10474.12s -> 10478.97s]  I've got some screws back here we're going to take care of.
[10521.38s -> 10528.41s]  We'll deal with you later.
[10528.41s -> 10530.17s]  Oh my god, now look at this little thing.
[10530.17s -> 10531.61s]  It's causing this much of a problem.
[10541.90s -> 10542.94s]  Artery?
[10542.94s -> 10577.51s]  All right, let's pull this thing out.
[10577.51s -> 10586.39s]  We're going to take this whole thing apart too.
[10587.93s -> 10588.89s]  Oh, joy.
[10589.37s -> 10599.69s]  Flyers probably.
[10599.69s -> 10601.21s]  We'll deal with you later.
[10601.21s -> 10601.85s]  You stay there.
[10602.86s -> 10604.70s]  Anything else on the main frame of the computer?
[10605.26s -> 10606.20s]  I don't think so.
[10606.84s -> 10609.59s]  Well, there is.
[10609.59s -> 10613.10s]  Screwed up.
[10613.10s -> 10624.87s]  You know, take, I'm going to do the whole skeleton too.
[10627.67s -> 10635.74s]  Drop on the wall.
[10646.60s -> 10647.24s]  Backplate?
[10648.57s -> 10649.61s]  Get this backplate.
[10649.61s -> 10650.17s]  Is that it?
[10651.59s -> 10652.39s]  That's got to be it.
[10653.27s -> 10654.47s]  No, I got this shit too.
[10658.55s -> 10659.03s]  Grills?
[10659.90s -> 10662.54s]  No, I think that's it.
[10667.93s -> 10668.65s]  Now the rubber things.
[10668.65s -> 10669.21s]  No, come on.
[10669.93s -> 10670.73s]  We'll go up here.
[10671.93s -> 10672.57s]  Oh, okay.
[10674.57s -> 10675.69s]  I thought that comes off.
[10676.33s -> 10678.46s]  I think that's it.
[10679.66s -> 10680.86s]  We'll check back on it later.
[10682.50s -> 10684.34s]  So we've got some parts left to do.
[10685.30s -> 10692.86s]  There's a lot of shit in there.
[10693.66s -> 10697.78s]  Can't just pull it out?
[10699.51s -> 10700.15s]  Oh, okay.
[10700.15s -> 10701.11s]  I'll do it again.
[10703.66s -> 10704.06s]  Why not?
[10710.52s -> 10711.00s]  Bullshit.
[10711.80s -> 10724.01s]  Turn, tilt.
[10725.59s -> 10725.91s]  Come on.
[10731.05s -> 10733.82s]  This is just fun to do.
[10733.82s -> 10734.38s]  It really is.
[10735.10s -> 10739.03s]  Oh, my back.
[10739.59s -> 10742.81s]  Dude, I swear to God, something's fucking wrong with me.
[10743.61s -> 10749.98s]  My spine is so fucked up.
[10758.14s -> 10758.78s]  None of these come out?
[10759.34s -> 10761.93s]  I'm going to hold mono just in case.
[10761.93s -> 10763.61s]  I feel like something's going to come out of there.
[10763.61s -> 10768.22s]  No?
[10768.22s -> 10768.86s]  Okay.
[10768.86s -> 10769.90s]  The video card.
[10769.90s -> 10772.86s]  Let's take a look.
[10772.86s -> 10779.40s]  Uh-huh.
[10780.12s -> 10790.68s]  Is that it?
[10791.24s -> 10793.21s]  Can I pull this apart now?
[10793.21s -> 10793.61s]  Yep.
[10793.61s -> 10793.93s]  Whoa.
[10795.05s -> 10801.96s]  There you go.
[10801.96s -> 10802.92s]  That's it looking like inside.
[10804.74s -> 10805.70s]  Take a look at the teeth.
[10806.34s -> 10809.00s]  And I think that's it.
[10810.55s -> 10811.75s]  I can't pull this out, can I?
[10812.39s -> 10813.59s]  All right.
[10813.59s -> 10814.15s]  Yes, I can.
[10814.87s -> 10817.05s]  All right.
[10817.05s -> 10817.61s]  See you later.
[10819.22s -> 10822.34s]  That leaves us with a CPU.
[10823.38s -> 10824.23s]  What about that?
[10824.23s -> 10825.35s]  I'm going to have to take this apart too.
[10826.89s -> 10827.13s]  No?
[10829.61s -> 10830.17s]  No?
[10830.17s -> 10830.73s]  I guess not.
[10832.52s -> 10833.08s]  Hard drive?
[10833.96s -> 10835.86s]  I'm going to do all this shit.
[10835.86s -> 10836.50s]  Wow.
[10836.50s -> 10837.14s]  This is pretty cool.
[10838.02s -> 10841.99s]  This is a solid stare, right?
[10854.58s -> 10855.06s]  Noises.
[10855.62s -> 10856.02s]  Three.
[10856.82s -> 10862.22s]  Oops.
[10862.22s -> 10862.46s]  Cool.
[10863.10s -> 10864.70s]  Anything else to pull off of you?
[10865.58s -> 10866.87s]  I don't think so.
[10868.71s -> 10870.31s]  I don't think you have anything either.
[10873.42s -> 10875.34s]  That leaves us with the final piece.
[10876.30s -> 10878.22s]  The motherboard.
[10878.22s -> 10900.63s]  Scratch it up real nice.
[10901.19s -> 10910.20s]  All right.
[10910.20s -> 10911.24s]  Is that it?
[10911.24s -> 10915.06s]  Is there something else?
[10915.06s -> 10915.38s]  Oh, dude.
[10915.38s -> 10915.78s]  What is this?
[10915.78s -> 10916.18s]  What is this?
[10916.18s -> 10916.98s]  EVGA?
[10916.98s -> 10922.15s]  Oh, wait.
[10922.15s -> 10922.71s]  GIGABYTE?
[10923.43s -> 10924.31s]  What's left?
[10924.31s -> 10942.55s]  Something over here.
[10960.52s -> 10961.32s]  What about this?
[10961.96s -> 10962.84s]  Another piece here?
[10963.40s -> 10965.24s]  Does it pop out?
[10965.24s -> 10965.88s]  Oh.
[10965.88s -> 10969.32s]  Okay.
[10969.88s -> 10979.56s]  Oh, the graphics card.
[10980.12s -> 10983.18s]  What would it be?
[10983.98s -> 10984.30s]  Oh.
[10986.62s -> 10998.30s]  There's a bunch of random shit.
[11002.41s -> 11004.95s]  There is something else on here.
[11005.59s -> 11007.13s]  Or on here.
[11014.26s -> 11014.90s]  This piece?
[11018.33s -> 11020.89s]  It would look like this little slap right here.
[11031.42s -> 11032.52s]  Really?
[11032.52s -> 11033.24s]  This little thing?
[11037.93s -> 11039.37s]  Six more pieces.
[11039.37s -> 11054.89s]  A table?
[11057.69s -> 11058.25s]  Apparently.
[11058.89s -> 11059.85s]  God, fuck you.
[11063.66s -> 11065.50s]  Two, three, four.
[11065.50s -> 11066.46s]  Well, that's almost all of it.
[11066.46s -> 11066.94s]  Just two more.
[11067.74s -> 11081.13s]  The fan?
[11084.39s -> 11084.87s]  Dude.
[11084.87s -> 11086.63s]  Will you pick the fucking thing up?
[11087.99s -> 11089.19s]  You're making me crazy.
[11090.47s -> 11092.39s]  That's it.
[11096.30s -> 11127.27s]  Computer.
[11127.35s -> 11131.26s]  You forgot the seasoning.
[11131.26s -> 11134.82s]  All right, let's do Blade and Sorcery.
[11134.82s -> 11138.89s]  Let's try the update.
[11138.89s -> 11142.01s]  This game is so much fucking fun, but we'll try something else.
[11153.34s -> 11155.58s]  We'll do the Blade and Sorcery update.
[11157.05s -> 11158.49s]  That was way easier than the microwave.
[11158.49s -> 11159.29s]  There was no other screw.
[11160.01s -> 11162.12s]  All right, let me go pee.
[11162.12s -> 11163.40s]  Let me grab some more water.
[11163.40s -> 11164.60s]  And we'll do Blade and Sorcery.
[11164.60s -> 11165.40s]  Be right back.
