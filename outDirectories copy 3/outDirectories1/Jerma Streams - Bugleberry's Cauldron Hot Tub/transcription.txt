[8.18s -> 25.99s]  Oh hello, pardon me just one moment. Good to see you again, all of you. Of course you know who I am, I know who you are.
[25.99s -> 39.48s]  It's me, B.F. Mugleberry. You're still your favorite person in the world. I am here to show you a few wonderful, magical things.
[39.48s -> 48.89s]  Three of which, don't want to drop my magical potions, but what is it? What's the matter?
[50.86s -> 66.44s]  There's too much reverb, like me. I haven't even gotten started yet, just give me one moment.
[66.44s -> 78.52s]  Oh, just hold on, wait just a second, hold on a minute. Reverb, that's what he said.
[82.50s -> 98.17s]  Hold the book upside down for God's sake. Reverb, reverb, reverb. Thank you. The smell of diminishing echo.
[98.17s -> 114.94s]  Take that very quickly. That's one tablespoon of riboflavin. That's good. Is that even correct? I believe it was.
[115.02s -> 144.33s]  One dash of mouth droppings. A batwing, which I have here somewhere. Batwing, leviton, and of course cave moss.
[144.33s -> 160.58s]  Cave moss from a cave that I have explored, all these ingredients I've explored, many times over, just like that.
[160.58s -> 169.96s]  Now this should. I know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Everybody relax. Hold on.
[170.68s -> 186.12s]  With one touch of the head. One, two, three, get it. As they say, bottoms up.
[210.95s -> 223.77s]  Hello. Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear what I'm saying? Hello. Yes. Are we fixed? Is it better?
[224.81s -> 228.65s]  Oh, that is such a breakthrough. That's quite a breakthrough.
[229.53s -> 235.64s]  The spell of diminishing echo. I have to write that. Make sure it's etched with blood.
[237.34s -> 243.56s]  Anyways, let me just briefly tell you what we're doing now that you can possibly understand.
[244.52s -> 250.92s]  As you know, I'm B.F. Bugalberry. I'm here to show you my cauldron of acid, my cauldron of demonic fluid.
[251.56s -> 259.56s]  And in this we will be creating spells, monsters, creatures of the likes of which you have absolutely
[259.56s -> 267.08s]  never seen. I can guarantee you that one. I'm your host Bugalberry. Let us begin, shall we?
[267.88s -> 275.32s]  The first recipe that I would like to create for you is one that I'm sure you're going to be very
[275.32s -> 285.74s]  interested in. It is a spell, a secret drink that everyone knows the ingredients to. I'll
[285.74s -> 291.37s]  start with a little bit of nutmeg. Nutmeg flavoring. Oh, no, that's not right. That's
[291.37s -> 297.99s]  musk of muskrat. Gotta get that one right, Bugalberry. This is it. Make sure I have the label
[297.99s -> 309.30s]  right. Yes, this is nutmeg. A dash of nutmeg into the cauldron it goes, whisking, filling,
[311.24s -> 318.89s]  screaming in a way, yearning for its brothers and sisters to join the pot with it.
[319.98s -> 327.66s]  Next is lemon lime peel. There's a lemon peel here. And we go like this. We go, bam! We go, bam!
[329.70s -> 338.62s]  Up next, there's two ounces of corn syrup, which I believe this is. We have some flavored corn syrup
[342.89s -> 353.56s]  there. It is a dash, a dash of caramel coloring. Just this way here. There it is, a dash of caramel
[353.56s -> 365.14s]  color. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There we go. And then we stir, stir.
[365.78s -> 372.36s]  We end up with a beverage that I trust you will put this down. I really want to get into this one
[372.36s -> 380.63s]  here. What do those witches say? What do those witches say? Double, double, toil and trouble.
[381.96s -> 387.96s]  We don't actually say that, you know. We don't actually do those things. Why would we say double,
[387.96s -> 393.16s]  double, toil and trouble? I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense to me.
[393.64s -> 407.99s]  Oh, there it is. I believe it's ready to test. So, let's see how it comes out.
[417.03s -> 430.41s]  Looks like it's the right color. Has a good smell. Give it a taste. Just like the real
[430.41s -> 434.33s]  thing. I bet you can't tell a difference. I bet you couldn't tell a difference.
[435.13s -> 443.29s]  Let me upload this to YouTube on a science channel. This is technically a science channel now.
[443.93s -> 450.18s]  I mean, I am creating all kinds of spells and creatures that you will see very soon.
[450.98s -> 461.37s]  That's the recipe for not hola. Don't want to say the first seed word. Just to help get arrested.
[464.34s -> 474.87s]  So, coming up next. Oh, if you wondered, ladies and gentlemen, where the characters
[476.02s -> 485.16s]  that Gerber creates, where they come from. Oh, do I have news for you? He has nothing to do with it.
[486.15s -> 492.63s]  He commissions me and I create the creatures. I create the characters and I create
[493.67s -> 499.51s]  many other things that he uses. Don't let him fool you. Don't let him do that. So,
[499.51s -> 504.47s]  we're going to make some now because that's why I'm here. I'm here to show you the process.
[505.19s -> 512.36s]  Look, my thinking, how I do things when I create these characters. The first character we're going
[512.36s -> 521.66s]  to make, we'll see. I want to see if you can guess who they are before they come out. First up,
[521.66s -> 533.22s]  we're going to use, let me get it right, one walrus whiskey. And it's been dehydrated
[534.73s -> 551.66s]  many times over. If you don't spit it, it won't work. One can of Pringles. I don't have those.
[551.66s -> 562.84s]  What can I substitute? One concentrated liquid from a tomb of the 70s. This is it right here.
[562.84s -> 576.07s]  As you say, this is from 1976. Yeah, 1977. You can tell. This is very, very raw. Very raw.
[580.12s -> 590.49s]  It's very raw. The 1970s. There we go. A little extra. Then next onto this
[591.54s -> 612.66s]  is wishful thinking. And the final ingredient is this. Germa's DNA. I collected this for many years
[613.30s -> 626.36s]  collecting soda cans and scrubbing his toilet many times over. Plenty of Germa's DNA to create.
[627.00s -> 638.71s]  Let's see who we got here. We need quite a bit of this. Okay. Whoa, whoa, don't be too. Whoa,
[638.79s -> 645.83s]  hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, it's starting to get windy. It's starting to get
[645.83s -> 665.43s]  windy. Come on. Rise. Rise. Mustache Germa.
[697.53s -> 703.66s]  Why do I keep saying that? Let's go. Yeah, go. No, character registration is on your right.
[704.71s -> 714.97s]  Go that way. No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That way. Yes. Oh, he's an idiot. He put very much brain
[714.97s -> 727.62s]  and power in that. Our next character that we will be creating, this is a popular one. Let's start
[728.26s -> 735.42s]  the process. I've got to keep this moving. Five percent. Not that one. Not that one.
[735.98s -> 748.14s]  There it is. Five percent of every children's Halloween costume. Yes. A pinch. A small pinch
[748.14s -> 759.53s]  of mouse droppings. We'll be using these quite frequently. That was more than a pinch. Hey.
[768.12s -> 776.17s]  That wasn't part of the recipe. I just wanted to see what that felt like.
[776.97s -> 791.88s]  It felt pretty good. Strange. Very strange. Anyways, a pinch of purple liquid. This is blue,
[791.88s -> 809.13s]  but we put red in already. Of course, children's DNA should be used very frequently. As you see it
[809.13s -> 816.41s]  pilling, bubbling again like it always does. Mesmerizing. Hypnotizing goes. I'm weak of men,
[816.41s -> 834.14s]  but I am not a weak man. A strong man. And then all we need to do is wait. Stir. And that will
[834.14s -> 869.35s]  give us. Oh, who do you think will be that character? Arise. Arise. I don't think that's
[869.35s -> 874.23s]  going to make it that far. I'm not even quite sure a German will be able to use that one.
[875.77s -> 883.96s]  It's not that different. Kind of. I tried. Maybe he'll make it. And then it is his DNA.
[885.48s -> 898.57s]  Coming up next. We have a good one. The first on this list is protein powder. Protein powder,
[898.57s -> 909.94s]  which I have down here somewhere. We can use mouse droppings. Protein powder. This protein
[910.42s -> 920.04s]  droppings. You just don't know it. A small dash of testosterone. Lots of it. There it is. Lots of
[920.84s -> 937.40s]  it. A little bit of vitamin D3, which is this one here. Yes, it is vitamin D3. Make sure you take
[937.40s -> 942.44s]  that by the way. Not enough people get vitamin D in their diet and they don't go into the sun
[942.44s -> 949.93s]  to get the sunshine. You need more vitamin D. Go get it. It prevents a lot of things. Helps you
[949.93s -> 959.34s]  with the cold, the blues. Makes you feel good. A little bit of tanning lotion, which I believe I
[959.34s -> 975.16s]  have some down here. Tanning lotion. Oh yes, yes, yes. There we are. If you didn't know tanning
[975.16s -> 982.17s]  lotion was made from fig leaves. Don't know how accurate that is, but this is not a science.
[986.84s -> 1001.80s]  A little bit of kosher salt. A little bit of kosher salt. And finally, the DNA. Oh, that was
[1001.80s -> 1012.97s]  way too close to my face. Yeah, but please arise. Whatever you have been, whatever you have been,
[1012.97s -> 1022.52s]  whatever you will do, arise. Oh, this is a big one. He's a big boy. That's a big boy.
[1023.80s -> 1048.14s]  Of course, that's muscle germ. Here's a big guy. Very strong. You know, it probably takes a long
[1048.14s -> 1053.58s]  time in the gym unless you know me. Unless you know me and I can make a clone of you.
[1054.30s -> 1059.58s]  Then you can just send your clone in to go out in the town and people will think it was you
[1059.58s -> 1063.50s]  and you're gonna sit there and just go like this on your computer and nobody will know it was you.
[1066.28s -> 1081.21s]  So, the next one. I've been waiting to create this for a few months now at least.
[1083.64s -> 1092.47s]  I was told that this was an important character. Let's go ahead and start with the catnip.
[1092.95s -> 1104.94s]  Not new very much. Just a little bit of catnip. Kitties love it. Some humans do too.
[1109.18s -> 1122.95s]  A pinch of catnip. A small amount of Lynx venom. The most powerful destructive substances on earth.
[1123.83s -> 1132.66s]  Just a drop will kill a donkey. Don't ask me why we always use that term. Don't ask me why a donkey
[1132.66s -> 1138.92s]  has to be the thing we kill to determine how poisonous something is. Oh, it's enough to kill
[1138.92s -> 1147.22s]  a horse. Why are you killing a horse? What's wrong with you? You don't understand. You're killing demons.
[1147.78s -> 1161.51s]  Ridiculous. Up next we have, what is next? Can't read any of my glasses. Some water on it. Up next
[1161.51s -> 1182.23s]  we have, hair of the bobcat. And finally, oh, Gemma's DNA. I might put something else in here too.
[1182.23s -> 1192.52s]  Right now Gemma's DNA. What will we create this time? Arise. Doesn't even need stirring. It's
[1192.52s -> 1205.14s]  ready. It's just the chemicals reacting into each other. Come on up, catboy German.
[1214.78s -> 1227.18s]  Where am I? I don't need to wink into the spirit. Why? Ow, my head. My brain just hurt.
[1228.14s -> 1237.61s]  Where? What the fuck is happening? What? Do I know who you are? This way. Bye-bye. Registration.
[1237.61s -> 1245.72s]  Registration. Character registration over there. Talk to Lucy. Talk to Lucy. Lucy, she's waving at
[1245.72s -> 1255.29s]  you. Yes, Lucy, thank you. The next character we'll be creating is a silly one. Oh, it's cold,
[1255.29s -> 1268.34s]  I think. One, two, three, four, four dehydrated frozen ice cubes. I dropped it because it was
[1268.34s -> 1278.47s]  too cold and I got it in. Wow, wowee. That was very, very cold. Too cold. Too cold. A little
[1278.47s -> 1290.54s]  bit of kosher salt. The fangs of the ever-living dragon like we used previously. A little diarrhea
[1290.62s -> 1300.52s]  potion or whatever it was. And then all it takes is a very simple potion, very simple brew,
[1300.52s -> 1318.41s]  a little bit more of, you guessed it. It's getting cold. It's getting chilly in here. Anybody else
[1318.41s -> 1352.25s]  feel a breeze? Does anybody else feel a slight breeze? Wow, that was cool. That was cool, man.
[1354.79s -> 1365.37s]  Oh, don't do that actually. That was cool. I know some of you do. I see it. I see it right there.
[1365.37s -> 1369.64s]  That was a good joke. Thank you. I do them better than the guy that owns this place.
[1372.22s -> 1382.57s]  So the final creature we're going to make, you don't even need the book. We're going freestyle on
[1382.57s -> 1400.22s]  this one. Rink stuff. Crumping kitty liver. Catnip. Mush of the buscrap. I don't even have a recipe
[1400.22s -> 1411.56s]  for this one. Ocean water. The caramel coloring. We are going to get something extraordinary.
[1412.76s -> 1417.22s]  Oops. It's all right. It's all right. It was just a catnip. That stuff's pretty cheap.
[1418.10s -> 1433.59s]  It's not, it's not this stuff. Don't drop this stuff. I stirred up. What are we going to get?
[1433.59s -> 1445.64s]  I want to create my own creature. My own creation. And what is it? What is it? I feel
[1445.64s -> 1451.56s]  like I'm playing Monster Rancher. I saw those terminated by strings. They were pretty good.
[1453.83s -> 1466.57s]  Whoa. What is it? Oh, dear. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no. This is horrible. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[1467.53s -> 1472.25s]  Oh, he's, oh, he's coming after me. He's, oh, he's fighting. Okay, I've got to be ready for this.
[1472.89s -> 1478.89s]  Hey, I didn't even, I didn't even give him a name. What was his name? I don't even know what he was
[1478.89s -> 1488.31s]  doing. Why would he attack me? A fish bastard. I don't even know what I did, but I keep putting
[1488.31s -> 1496.12s]  my hands in here and it feels, it burned for a little while the first few minutes of this dream.
[1498.92s -> 1505.46s]  You're going to track him down Lucy. He's on the loose. Oh, it hurts, but it doesn't hurt at the
[1505.46s -> 1513.99s]  same time. It's very odd. Lucy, I'm going to do something here that might, I don't,
[1515.40s -> 1523.22s]  when they were coming out, it looks comfortable. Oh, oh, oh, it hurts a lot. It hurts a lot,
[1524.02s -> 1536.97s]  but something about this is, oh, I, something's missing though. I like it, but I feel like I
[1536.97s -> 1545.18s]  should be more comfortable. I feel like the atmosphere needs to change. My, my mindset needs
[1545.18s -> 1553.59s]  to change. I'm getting this strong, incredible urge to receive donations and subscriptions.
[1554.60s -> 1561.69s]  I don't even know what that means. I don't even, I, I, I've only ever streamed with German once,
[1561.69s -> 1572.82s]  twice maybe. I feel so good right now. Oh, something about this. I could get used to this.
[1574.65s -> 1589.13s]  Hot diggity dog. Lucy, get all this shit out of here. Clear this out. I want, I, I want to
[1589.13s -> 1594.54s]  hang out with the chat now. I want to hang out with everybody over here. I want to give them,
[1595.70s -> 1604.86s]  yeah, clear this out. I want you to get rid of that stuff. Get rid of it. Thank you. No, no,
[1604.86s -> 1632.38s]  go off the back door. Go off the back door. Don't drop any of those. Don't drop any of
[1632.38s -> 1640.98s]  those potions. I saw you. You have no idea how hard it took. That was, that's 5,500,000 years
[1640.98s -> 1656.52s]  of my life. What do we do? Did somebody say I was muted? Muted? Are we muted? I was just
[1656.52s -> 1663.48s]  yelling at the people with my potions. I said, don't drop them. They just picked them up and
[1663.48s -> 1674.26s]  walked out of here. They went, they went too fast is what they did. But, uh, this is kind of nice.
[1674.26s -> 1685.62s]  What should we do now? I mean, this wheel is here. I wonder if we should use it. Should we use the
[1685.62s -> 1699.96s]  wheel? What's on here? We have, if we can get, can we get a closer, closer view of this? But
[1699.96s -> 1708.54s]  should we have a reason for this to be on here? Yeah, let's put, put an overlay on. Why don't we
[1708.54s -> 1722.65s]  make it fun? Let's make it fun. Oh, this is pretty nice. Five subs for a name on a ball.
[1723.70s -> 1732.89s]  Ten subs for your name on my body, which I'm gonna have to take this off eventually. 20 subs
[1732.89s -> 1741.77s]  for a dance party. Oh, I bet you want to see that. Oh, it's nice in here. Without the cauldron
[1741.77s -> 1751.64s]  bubbling. Why not? Why not? Without the cauldron bubbling, it's actually pretty nice. I really
[1751.64s -> 1758.79s]  hope that that fish face guy, hope they catch him. I feel like I have a scratch this big,
[1758.79s -> 1775.67s]  right here, right there. Wait, hold on a second. Did you just say that every single thing has been
[1775.67s -> 1785.46s]  redeemed? It happened already? It's only, how many subs was it? It happened already? Oh,
[1786.10s -> 1795.06s]  this is very liquidy. Very liquidy. Already? I haven't even gotten my cool shirt on yet.
[1798.76s -> 1800.92s]  Well, we're gonna have to get their names down.
[1809.50s -> 1817.40s]  Apparently, people love me. Well, let's hope we can get all those on the body before we continue.
[1818.04s -> 1826.07s]  How do I even put this on? Oh, this is good on the back, too. This feels good.
[1829.86s -> 1837.82s]  I haven't even gotten the shirt on. How many? Can you even count?
[1843.32s -> 1859.29s]  Wow. My days of potion making should be effectively over. Oh, we got some names. Oh,
[1859.29s -> 1871.90s]  there it goes. Community Jake, could you come over here? I don't even have the shirt on. Thank you.
[1871.98s -> 1879.11s]  Community Jake. See, I can hire him, too. I can hire him, too. I'll go over these names in just a
[1879.11s -> 1899.45s]  second. We should have to spin the wheel four times. I'm just gonna lay it on like this. What the
[1899.45s -> 1908.47s]  hell? Oh, we have called me false. Thank you so much for your 10 community subs. Also,
[1909.43s -> 1919.02s]  the great Canadian FK Nug. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank yous to Tippedover.
[1919.02s -> 1933.91s]  Wow. That's your name on a ball. I'm gonna say people's names twice. Oh, don't look at that.
[1933.91s -> 1945.13s]  Don't look at that. This is not. Don't look at that. Daddy? Oh, no, it's Daddy Big Box.
[1947.42s -> 1955.83s]  That's kind of comedic if you think about it. It's pretty comedic. Blind Irene 1. Thank you,
[1955.83s -> 1967.80s]  Blind Irene. Poly Hex. Thank you. Wow. I'm gonna put this in again. Let's do this here.
[1970.07s -> 1974.95s]  Oh, and we also have the eco leech. Thank you. There's no more of these remaining, by the way.
[1980.50s -> 1990.47s]  At this point, we didn't get enough balls to do this with. Throw them in. Good. Good. All right.
[1990.47s -> 1999.80s]  All that went in the eye. Fames. Wow. Fames, thank you so much for those 10 community subs.
[1999.80s -> 2006.71s]  Who else we have? Cherry Rowlett. Wow. Thank you for those 10 community subs.
[2007.35s -> 2015.78s]  Shinomi. Thank you for those 10 community subs. Oh, oh, but I can't.
[2017.30s -> 2031.94s]  Oh, it's too much. I can't get up and spin the wheel. Let's do it. That's 8 Bugs. That's 8 Bugs,
[2031.94s -> 2046.10s]  my favorite. Oh, I love Bugs. Give me a few Bugs. Did I get them by the way? Are we good?
[2048.09s -> 2063.72s]  Oh, this is what I'm talking about. Delicious Bugs. Oh, that's unbelievably delicious. Again.
[2073.08s -> 2085.91s]  Oh, that's a random potion. The microphone is wet, apparently. What's in this one? This looks
[2086.31s -> 2097.74s]  manna. It's like it's under water. Can you hear? I can hear it. It just sucks. Oh, well.
[2111.80s -> 2118.60s]  Oh, shoot. I have to write somebody's name on my face.
[2118.60s -> 2155.03s]  How am I going to write that? That's impossible. Let me do it. Please take this. Storms and shadows.
[2155.03s -> 2173.03s]  You're going to go right here. Let's see. Oh, geez. It's been quite difficult. I don't. Oh,
[2173.03s -> 2198.94s]  that's an E. This is literally not possible. I need an S. The aliens find us one day.
[2199.66s -> 2220.41s]  It's over. Wrong way. Storm of what? Storms of... This is so hard. You have no idea.
[2220.41s -> 2235.77s]  I'm drawing backwards. Storms of shadow. You get the idea, okay? I still have a bug in my mouth.
[2245.72s -> 2258.92s]  I lost it. Where'd it go? I don't even know who that was.
[2265.18s -> 2270.82s]  I need to swallow this thing in my mouth, okay? Somebody said damaged?
[2275.69s -> 2287.69s]  Swallowed. Just that simple. Oh, Shinobi. Did we get Shinobi already? What did I not get? Oh,
[2287.77s -> 2299.38s]  I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is this 15? A feed line.
[2299.94s -> 2304.76s]  Feed line defined. Thank you from a 10 community sub. Do I have to write that on my face?
[2305.83s -> 2316.55s]  Oh, okay. Vertix. Thank you. Clavicle. Thank you. And hello, my name is Blank. Thank you.
[2317.27s -> 2321.43s]  Let me try to move the... Do you want to come adjust the microphone?
[2323.40s -> 2338.84s]  Give me the microphone adjuster. That's my neck. Ow. Ow. Ow. Okay. How does that sound? Is that
[2338.84s -> 2348.86s]  better? I sound like Bane. What does that mean? I don't know who that is. Your skin, your neck skin
[2348.86s -> 2359.93s]  is peeling. They're saved. Saved. Okay. Thank you. We have some more to read. I need to spin the wheel
[2359.93s -> 2365.02s]  a few more times. We did not anticipate this many people were going to actually do this,
[2365.66s -> 2375.27s]  so we were not very well prepared. Sentry J Man. Thank you, Sentry J Man. Appreciate it.
[2375.27s -> 2387.32s]  Master Mudkips. Thank you. Chef Lazarus. Thank you. And real anime hours. Thank you so much.
[2387.32s -> 2407.38s]  So who do I need to put on my body? Where is that marker? Oh. Call me false. Call me false.
[2408.82s -> 2416.86s]  Okay. There you are. Call me false. And then Blind Irene. Oh, interesting. Blind Irene
[2418.25s -> 2430.68s]  one. And then who? Ego. What's it again? Sorry. My hearing's not as good. Ego Leech. Okay. Ego
[2430.68s -> 2448.65s]  Leech. Olly Hex. Olly Hex. Okay. Daddy Big Bugs. Is this what people do? I'm running out of room.
[2451.19s -> 2459.96s]  I'm running out of space already. Where do you put it? There we are. Fanes. Okay.
[2459.96s -> 2467.93s]  And this is not coming off. This shirt's not coming off. Sorry about that, all of you.
[2467.93s -> 2481.03s]  Fanes. Chevrolet. Real anime hours. I'm going to go on the other arm. Why not? What? Real anime
[2481.03s -> 2485.75s]  hours. What are people saying? Do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to take this off.
[2485.75s -> 2492.68s]  Out of your mind? Have you lost your mind? You already got the scene of the abominable snowman
[2492.68s -> 2506.14s]  pretty much naked. That's not enough for you. What was it again? Real anime hours. Real anime
[2507.77s -> 2516.28s]  hours. Well, I did my best. I just keep on wrecking. All right. I can't do this anymore.
[2516.84s -> 2527.13s]  What was that? Century J-Man. Century J-Man. This thing's running out of ink. Take a look,
[2527.21s -> 2537.56s]  everybody. Those are your names on me. He removed the jorts. Okay. All right. That was interesting.
[2537.56s -> 2543.74s]  Century J-Man and all of you. I hope nobody heard that. I really hope nobody heard that
[2543.74s -> 2549.06s]  because that was awful. That was awful. It was absolutely horrible. Please tell me no one heard
[2549.06s -> 2562.02s]  that noise. Nobody did. All right. No more writing on body. I'll do right on face. I'm not writing
[2562.02s -> 2567.70s]  on body anymore. You can't do this. I know about potions. I know how things work. I know if you do
[2567.70s -> 2577.98s]  this too much, you could get you sick. It'll make you sick. I'm not doing it. What is this? Red
[2577.98s -> 2582.62s]  Riolu. We did not anticipate this many. We thought we were going to spin the wheel three times.
[2584.42s -> 2591.53s]  We didn't think we were going to spin the wheel like five times. Sedata. Thank you. Red Riolu.
[2591.53s -> 2600.86s]  Thank you. What else we have here? Sculptor. Sculptor. What else we have? Forklifter. Wow.
[2601.75s -> 2611.26s]  Selling out. Is this what it is? Selling out. Selling out feels pretty good. E-Himbo.
[2615.48s -> 2625.24s]  This is the one that I just grabbed. This is quite, quite the image I would say.
[2626.22s -> 2639.18s]  Quite the image I would say. We got 100 subs. Oh, God. E-Himbo. Okay. Let's spin the wheel.
[2640.82s -> 2645.14s]  It's very hard to keep track of and keep up with it, but we're going to try. Let's see if we can
[2645.14s -> 2664.12s]  get something here. That's the question. You see, when we originally envisioned this stream,
[2664.12s -> 2673.11s]  I thought maybe, maybe we would have people ask me questions, but when 2,000 people subscribe
[2673.11s -> 2683.29s]  at the same time in 15 to 20 minutes, that becomes not possible anymore. What's the question?
[2684.66s -> 2686.02s]  Did I fart in the tub?
[2697.43s -> 2711.03s]  Does that answer your question? All right. I need to do things. 50 more subs. What's the name?
[2712.28s -> 2719.99s]  Freddie Dredd, the musician. I'm just going to use this because it's easier. Oh, you have it
[2719.99s -> 2729.53s]  right there. Freddie Dredd, the musician. Very talented young man. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. You're
[2729.53s -> 2738.09s]  going to have to go down somewhere on the neck area. Riding backwards and sideways,
[2739.05s -> 2753.83s]  mirrored. It should be a special skill. It should be like at the Olympics. Oh, actually,
[2753.83s -> 2773.66s]  that makes it a little easier. E. Oh, shit. Fuck. F-R-E. D. How did he do this? How did people do
[2773.66s -> 2778.71s]  this? It's not possible. It's not possible to do this. It's impossible. It really is.
[2781.11s -> 2794.02s]  Fred. Freddie Dredd. I like your last name, if that is your real name. E. F. Bugleberry is mine.
[2794.02s -> 2814.60s]  Stands for Barry Fennard Bugleberry. I do. Okay. Let's see. Freddie Dredd. Good. Very good. H. F.
[2814.60s -> 2841.30s]  S. K. A. H. Oh, man. H. F. S. H. F. S. K. A. K. A. F. H. F. H. F. H. This is painful.
[2841.30s -> 2848.79s]  J. D. A. I got scammed. Oh, yeah, I'm scammed. Oh, I'm the scammer.
[2849.72s -> 2861.27s]  Oh. Did you just say that there was a phone call? Somebody was trying to call? Who's calling?
[2861.27s -> 2868.31s]  You said 50 seconds before that. You said there was a phone call. Is that German? Hey, what's up?
[2868.31s -> 2876.22s]  Did you make the characters yet? Yes. Did you make the characters? The new characters?
[2876.22s -> 2879.90s]  Yes, I made them. Of course I did. That is all you are supposed to be doing.
[2881.50s -> 2886.06s]  I can't just hang out. I don't want you sitting around in a tub on the street. All right? I don't
[2886.46s -> 2888.78s]  want to die. It's a cauldron. Get out. Get out. You're done. You're done.
[2888.78s -> 2891.90s]  I'm not done. It's a cauldron. No, you're done. You're done. Get out of the hot tub.
[2891.90s -> 2894.47s]  It's not a hot tub. It's a hot tub. That's what it looks like. Get out.
[2894.47s -> 2896.95s]  He's just pissed because he's not getting the money. How much money did you make?
[2896.95s -> 2899.83s]  That's right, yeah. Too much. I get some of that money.
[2899.83s -> 2902.15s]  No, you don't. I get at least half of that money.
[2902.79s -> 2907.51s]  No. No, he doesn't. Not at all. Hang up on him.
[2907.51s -> 2909.67s]  Nothing to do with anything. Hang up on him.
[2909.67s -> 2912.07s]  This is not what we agreed to. Hang up on him.
[2912.07s -> 2916.15s]  Just get out. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Bugleberry. It was really nice to see you.
[2916.63s -> 2926.82s]  Shut up. Hang up on him. Did you hang up? Good. When he calls back, don't answer again.
[2927.72s -> 2932.92s]  He can come down here if he has a problem. Oh, I'm making money. Oh, that's what it's about.
[2932.92s -> 2940.34s]  He's annoyed that I'm making more money than he is. What a fucking joke. That was not a fart,
[2940.34s -> 2946.70s]  I swear to God. That was not a fart. It looked like it, but it wasn't. It kind of did look like
[2947.80s -> 2954.82s]  it. It sounded like it, too, if that picked up. Oh, what have we got here? More balls. Let's see
[2954.82s -> 2964.55s]  them. Well, he could do this if he really wanted to. Why is it my problem? Is there a lot coming in?
[2964.55s -> 2977.72s]  Oh, shit. I cannot read these all. I cannot read these. Freddy Dread gets a ball. He's on my face.
[2978.52s -> 2988.49s]  How does he get a ball? He has the whole real estate. Fanches, thank you.
[2990.65s -> 2999.45s]  Ghost Pop Live, thank you. Hey, Kip, thank you. Three more in the face. Oh, I think we have two
[2999.45s -> 3041.94s]  mics on. Oh, who's got a question? I'm not trying to scam, I promise. Aaron, what is that? What's
[3041.94s -> 3048.84s]  Aaron? What's Aaron? What is that? What's Aaron? Why are they saying that? Oh, I think we lost one
[3048.84s -> 3053.93s]  of our lights. I think one of our lights got screwed up. Hey, here's a question for you.
[3053.93s -> 3067.99s]  Why the fuck are we doing this? How's that one? What is my height, Bugleberry? I'm six foot four.
[3067.99s -> 3077.74s]  I'm not German at all. I'm up here and he's down here. I'm not German. Oh, these are the ones that
[3077.74s -> 3092.12s]  go on the face. Holy smokes, hold on. What is that one? Question. Any more questions? Oh,
[3092.92s -> 3109.59s]  I'm not going to be able to do this. Okay, so we have Vinsmore. Vins. Oh my God. Vinsmoke. Vinsmoke.
[3109.59s -> 3127.02s]  Vinsmoke. Metalzalor. Metalzalor. What'd you say? Metalzalor. Hold on. Metalzalor. That's right.
[3127.98s -> 3134.06s]  And then Goikki. Goikki, I'll put you up here. By the way, I just want to make this clear. I'll
[3134.06s -> 3146.87s]  say it in a second. Goikki. Here you are. Goikki. Excellent work. It just looks like the original.
[3146.87s -> 3157.03s]  It looks like old caveman paintings. This is Grug. My name's Grug. After paying for production
[3157.59s -> 3163.27s]  and paying for the people that are kind enough to be spending their time here, the remaining
[3163.27s -> 3169.48s]  proceeds of this stream will be given to charity. I want to make that very clear. So, I'm going to
[3169.48s -> 3176.44s]  be giving this to charity. I'm not going to be taking this. It's time for a dance party. Oh,
[3177.40s -> 3196.33s]  dance party. Play the music. Hold on. What the hell is that?
[3205.99s -> 3222.52s]  What is this? What the hell? I don't know how that happened. Man, that hurt.
[3223.32s -> 3234.17s]  Should we spin the wheel again? Is the water warm? Yeah, it is. It's perfect for me.
[3235.59s -> 3249.93s]  Negative 15 degrees Celsius. That's nice and warm for me. Stand up. Oh, no, no, no. I don't stand up.
[3249.93s -> 3255.50s]  I will spin the wheel again and hopefully we land on something besides Question. Maybe Question
[3255.50s -> 3261.06s]  should have been something we made small. That's my fault. I should not have made Question big.
[3261.70s -> 3270.94s]  Figured it would be easy. Let's go. That's foam. Time for a foam party.
[3292.70s -> 3315.69s]  Hold on. This looks really, really ridiculous. That's 2,000 subs. I just rolled around for 20
[3315.69s -> 3325.03s]  minutes. Who is this? Goo Berry Juice. Well, I dropped the marker in the hot tub. Hopefully,
[3325.03s -> 3329.77s]  we can get that out with a little bit of elbow grease. Goo Berry Juice.
[3336.23s -> 3342.98s]  Goo Berry Juice. Okay. That was directly into the eye socket. Thank God I'm already dead.
[3343.91s -> 3353.56s]  I'm an undead demon. I can handle it. Goo Berry a boat. I think it's time to end the names on
[3353.56s -> 3363.08s]  face. We're running out of room and I'm very wet. Goo Berry, we'll get you right here. Goo. Oh,
[3363.08s -> 3388.87s]  my God. Goo Berry. This looks like two musical notes. Goo Berry Juice. There you go. Goo Berry
[3388.87s -> 3401.88s]  Juice. You don't understand. I'm very wet and this is wet too. This mask. What mask? This mask
[3402.44s -> 3410.04s]  is going to be... Why are you saying that? You're talking about my skin. Weird, weird people on this
[3410.04s -> 3422.44s]  community. I sweat my arse off making characters for you to enjoy. You know how much I get paid
[3422.44s -> 3432.39s]  for it? 40 bucks a character. 40 bucks. Oh, Gerber, don't do that hot tub stream. Don't do
[3432.39s -> 3440.63s]  the hot tub thing. It's a cauldron, first of all. What? I would rather give it to charity.
[3441.29s -> 3451.93s]  This is what I'm doing. It's Shinoli. I'm going to do Shinoli on the cheek. What on the chin?
[3451.93s -> 3475.03s]  Shinoli. Shinoli. Fix the S. What's the other one? Captain Nemo. Captain. Hello, Captain Nemo.
[3482.23s -> 3488.55s]  I keep laughing really hard, but this looks like a three-year-old's bedroom wall that he would get
[3488.55s -> 3509.70s]  in trouble over. This is just... You got into the crayons. Let's spin the wheel. Oh no, not again.
[3518.23s -> 3526.31s]  It got in the eye again. How? How did that happen twice? Spray it in the tub. In the tub. In the tub.
[3526.31s -> 3541.88s]  Inside. How did it happen twice? Okay, I might need a small towel. It happened twice. Thank you,
[3541.88s -> 3557.96s]  Community Jake. Thank you. Oh, goodness gracious. I can't wait to see the out-of-context Twitter
[3557.96s -> 3572.84s]  tonight. Oh, boy. Just throw them in. Let's do another spin. Pinata time. It's time for the
[3572.84s -> 3590.73s]  pinata. All right, let's go. Okay, here it comes. The pinata. Oh, I got it. I got it.
[3599.88s -> 3607.16s]  All right, take it back. The pinata just broke his neck. That's all I did. He didn't have any candy
[3607.16s -> 3618.92s]  in it. That was just awful. His neck just fell down. Get him out of frame. Get him out of frame.
[3618.92s -> 3626.20s]  No, I don't want to. I don't want to. Look at him. He's very sad. Hold on. I'll fix him.
[3627.00s -> 3649.24s]  I'll fix him. Take it away. Take it away. Spin it again. Why don't we? Another random potion.
[3651.16s -> 3666.23s]  Interesting. Oh, what's this one? Yellow. It's like eggs. It smells like eggs.
[3674.34s -> 3679.66s]  Tastes like eggs too, but I like that. Oh, you know what I would do with this? I would drizzle
[3679.66s -> 3687.22s]  this on top of a piece of toast. Put an avocado on it. Oh, that would be scrumptious. You can take
[3687.22s -> 3699.19s]  that from me. You're probably noticing there's a small sliver here. I don't want to burp. Mute
[3699.19s -> 3709.80s]  my microphone. Mute my microphone. Did you make that? Did you lie or did you actually mute it?
[3709.80s -> 3720.92s]  Good. Good boy. So you're noticing there's a small sliver here. If that hits, it says apocalypse on
[3720.92s -> 3727.42s]  it. Oh, and you know what that means? That means we are done here. Oh, look at that. Look at that
[3727.42s -> 3742.26s]  nerd neck. I've heard that German has used that term before. Let's try. Get another one. Eat bugs
[3742.26s -> 3751.43s]  again. Eat more bugs. Just give me one of the little ones. One of these little guys here.
[3752.15s -> 3768.25s]  Okay. Holy shit. These are good. I really actually. Hold on. I'll get it. I'll get it.
[3768.25s -> 3787.35s]  I'll fix it. Wait. There we go. These are very creamy. I would just throw them in. You're going
[3787.35s -> 3794.15s]  to eat the bugs. You eat the bugs. You will eat the bugs. You will eat the bugs while you're saying
[3795.78s -> 3803.46s]  what's worse. Turtle. It's not even a bug. It's a turtle.
[3813.29s -> 3825.48s]  Oh no. Everything is sold out. Oh no. Oh, it's all sold out. Why don't we spin the wheel one more
[3825.48s -> 3831.34s]  time? Huh? Again, everything's going to charity from my portion. I'm going to be paying the
[3831.34s -> 3837.37s]  production staff handsomely. And then all of my portion from this stream is going to charity.
[3839.21s -> 3843.21s]  I wonder what's going to happen if we spin the wheel again. What do you think is going to happen?
[3849.29s -> 3867.90s]  Falling backwards. Don't end the stream. Let's hang out for five more minutes.
[3867.90s -> 3879.99s]  Let's see if I can read some of these names. That's xsparter45. Oh my God, a human. Thank you.
[3879.99s -> 3884.58s]  So what I want to do is I want to take a picture of this. I want to get them all out,
[3884.58s -> 3890.73s]  take a photo of it. I'll retweet it out. That sounds fun to me. If they'll do that in the next
[3890.73s -> 3900.44s]  day or so. I'll ask Jerma if it's okay. PPSlap. Thank you. Oh, tipped over. I think we got that
[3900.44s -> 3919.75s]  one already. Somebody said our stream Andy. Our stream Andy. Who's Andy? We did not anticipate
[3919.75s -> 3928.14s]  this amount of things happening. We only had enough stuff for like 25 people. I don't know why we
[3928.14s -> 3945.85s]  thought that that was going to work. Oh, it's time to spin the wheel. What's it landing on?
[3946.66s -> 3954.74s]  Oh shit, it landed on apocalypse. I'll see you all soon. Don't worry. We'll get out of this together.
[3954.74s -> 3961.32s]  Thank you. Let me just be really clear before the world ends. This was a fun little joke,
[3962.26s -> 3969.72s]  but I hope you enjoyed it. I appreciate you hanging out here, everybody. We'll get a nice
[3969.72s -> 3983.61s]  photo of all the subs from today. Oh shit. Get this off camera right now. Get it off camera.
[3987.69s -> 4009.10s]  Did we miss anybody up here? He was rigged. Ocean dweller. Ocean dweller. Should we get him up here
[4009.10s -> 4023.26s]  too? Let's get him up there. We want to get at least those ones. He said potion dweller.
[4031.05s -> 4055.06s]  Ocean dweller. And that's all the fifties. Okay. Ocean dweller. All the people on the arms,
[4056.01s -> 4059.85s]  I'll give you a special thanks very soon. I'll write it on my arm another day.
[4060.41s -> 4067.82s]  We didn't anticipate this many people. Thank you everybody. Have a great rest of your evening.
[4069.80s -> 4070.68s]  We're out of here.
