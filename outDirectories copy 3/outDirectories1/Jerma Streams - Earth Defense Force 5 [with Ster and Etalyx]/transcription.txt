[0.82s -> 8.46s]  Oh, you can hear me. I'm just sitting there like silent on my phone tweeting. I was just like,
[8.46s -> 17.05s]  I'm muted, whatever. That's why I always have the mic muted, because I'm just sitting there like,
[18.55s -> 26.33s]  okay. But hey, how you doing? How's everybody doing? Sorry for the delay. There was a lot of
[26.89s -> 34.84s]  strange technical issues. Talix had problems with his capture card. The lobby system in the game is
[34.84s -> 41.38s]  really, really strange. It's kind of a weird roundabout system in EDF 5 to play together and
[42.98s -> 51.10s]  joining off of each other's sessions and stuff. It's very odd. But Earth Defense Force 5 today,
[51.10s -> 59.70s]  tonight, and depending on how much fun this game is, you may see it again, because I was a huge fan
[59.70s -> 64.39s]  of the last one. Played it at least three or four times on stream and I played a shitload of it
[64.39s -> 70.01s]  off stream too. So without further ado, because we've been kind of sticking around and waiting
[70.01s -> 77.08s]  around, I think we're pretty much ready to go. Let's go ahead and see who's available here to
[77.08s -> 92.58s]  speak. I wonder who's here. Hello there. Anybody there? Hello there. Hello there. I'm here. Are
[92.58s -> 98.10s]  you eating? We're gonna have to wait like 15 minutes because I just got food. What'd you get?
[98.26s -> 103.62s]  Sounds good. What food did you get? It's, you know, rice and vegetables and pork.
[105.69s -> 114.49s]  Okay. But, but is it, did you make it yourself or was it? Ashley made it for me. Okay. Nice. Okay.
[114.49s -> 121.58s]  Sounds delicious. Because I'm an imbecile. I mean, I don't know how to do that, you know what I mean?
[123.62s -> 130.26s]  I don't know how to spell it out for us. Well, now we can start. I can eat and play because I'm a god
[130.26s -> 135.94s]  gamer. Cause I'd run a start because you're in, we're an hour late because of you as always. Hey,
[135.94s -> 140.42s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There were, excuse me. Hey, yeah, there were a lot of
[140.42s -> 146.18s]  problems. Yes. Yes. Italics his capture card got fucked up, but he's got enough control over that
[146.18s -> 149.78s]  and you couldn't figure out how to add friends and you couldn't figure out how to invite me to a
[149.78s -> 157.66s]  lobby. Beyond that, I wasn't told that maybe his eating schedule was happening beforehand. So I
[157.66s -> 165.54s]  didn't know to prepare a head for dinner. All right. That's it. Stream over. I'm going to go
[165.54s -> 171.72s]  play. I'm going to go count peanuts down the street or something. Every time you beat Cloud
[171.72s -> 177.69s]  Amari, you grow one centimeter. Did I just turn my, I'm like naked and I think I just accidentally
[177.69s -> 186.76s]  turned my webcam on. Did I do that? No, I didn't. Thank God. Are you naked? I don't, I don't wear
[186.76s -> 193.03s]  clothes. It's Alex. We live together. Can you please vouch for me? Why do I need somebody to
[193.03s -> 196.31s]  vouch for me for this? Hey dude, you like vouching, man. I don't wear clothes, right?
[199.45s -> 203.45s]  You don't wear clothes. Is that what you were asking me right now? I want you to confirm or
[203.45s -> 208.17s]  deny the fact that how often do I wear clothes? Is this really the question you want to be asking
[208.17s -> 213.29s]  me right now? I really want to know. Can you give like an example of talks? Give us an exam. When
[213.29s -> 219.13s]  did you first find out he doesn't wear clothes? Um, before we even moved, he was like, by the way,
[219.13s -> 222.97s]  I don't wear clothes. I'm going to have to start wearing clothes now. That was the first thing he
[222.97s -> 232.89s]  said. It was pretty immediate, like full nude or like boxers or underwear. Well, obviously I've
[232.89s -> 239.69s]  never seen the full nude, but I was told the stories. No, listen, I, I, I, all I said was this.
[239.69s -> 243.21s]  I said, I just want to make sure that you're, I want to make sure that are you okay with this? Are
[243.21s -> 247.13s]  you okay with me walking around shirtless? Like, yo, yo, you okay with that? Like, is that okay?
[247.77s -> 252.63s]  And he was like, yeah, I've seen you shirtless. Yeah, I can vouch for this actually. Cause now
[252.63s -> 255.99s]  that I think about it, you take your shirt off whenever you get the chance.
[258.23s -> 262.87s]  I just have the opposite of a never nude. No, it's good. You're very comfortable that way.
[262.87s -> 266.31s]  Like a lot of people would be shy taking their shirt off in front of other people, but like you,
[267.51s -> 274.15s]  you push past that. It's a, it's a, it's like a sweaty comfort thing. And I make sure I know,
[274.15s -> 278.79s]  but okay, if I told you that it's Alex before we moved in and you were like, nah, man, that,
[278.79s -> 284.04s]  I don't think, I don't like that. I would, I would wear like a fucking shirt. I need to make,
[284.04s -> 287.08s]  I want to make sure that you were like, okay, like you cool with me, like hanging out like with on
[287.08s -> 292.44s]  the couch, like no clothes on, like no shirt on. I've mentioned, I never go swimming. Like I never
[292.44s -> 296.68s]  go to the pool. I've never seen another human being. No, the amount of times that we've like
[296.68s -> 300.68s]  shared a hotel room and you're like, I'm going to take a shower and you just take your shirt off
[300.68s -> 303.88s]  and then you start another conversation and stand there shirtless for 10 minutes. This is how
[303.88s -> 311.70s]  fanfiction starts every time. That's not every time. Probably every time we've had a hotel
[311.70s -> 319.80s]  together. It's happened at least once. I'm going to need to install Microsoft word after this.
[319.80s -> 324.60s]  And you get really weird towards the end of the conversation. You like flex an arm and kiss it.
[327.58s -> 333.42s]  All right. All right. It's time. Are we ready to play the game? Yeah. I think we're finally ready
[333.50s -> 340.30s]  to play. Hey, welcome to EDF five. Uh, this has been doing the first mission.
[343.77s -> 348.17s]  Are we? I mean, you're the guy, the guy with the fork and knife in his hand.
[350.95s -> 354.87s]  I'm eating with what the fuck are you writing here? Oh, we have a valiant infantry. We are
[354.87s -> 358.87s]  the alpha team with passion and I'm not nice. That was a great, but are you writing this?
[358.87s -> 363.19s]  I keep trying to change controls, like, like, oh, go to prepared and then complete the mission.
[363.19s -> 369.51s]  But I'm using the D pad and if you touch the D pad, it's like, cause it's a dialogue.
[369.51s -> 375.29s]  I thought you were actually typing this stuff in being like weird. No way. Okay. Okay. No way.
[375.29s -> 380.89s]  Yeah. I mean, like, I'm saying, okay, I have to, how do you ready? The top option preparation
[380.89s -> 386.97s]  complete. Yeah. All right. So let's go over our classes. Looks like we're late because of italics
[386.97s -> 394.73s]  again. Oh, okay. No, what? No, it was a collective. It was a collective star. Couldn't figure out
[394.73s -> 401.13s]  how to use the PlayStation. It was also the last one to use the bathroom and he's eating right now.
[401.13s -> 403.61s]  Yeah. And by the way, when we used to have hotel rooms,
[408.70s -> 412.58s]  yeah, he used to, he used to eat in the bathroom. He used to bring,
[412.66s -> 418.82s]  I do that. You're right. Basically. Yeah. You're next to the two queens. Just one was enough.
[418.82s -> 423.86s]  And he takes every time. No, no, no, no. You don't have to use trash bags. If you get next to the
[423.86s -> 429.62s]  toilet, no, you would sit there with the fork and knife of the plate on the toilet. And it was just,
[429.62s -> 434.66s]  it was, it was chaos. You would leave trash around. You would let you would just, uh, by the way,
[435.30s -> 439.30s]  the shower drain is not a garbage disposal. You don't dump the leftover shit that you don't want
[439.30s -> 442.34s]  to eat down there. I don't know why you would do that. Do you, do you understand how much
[442.34s -> 446.90s]  throughout my lifespan, how much plastic I've saved and how much I've helped the environment
[446.90s -> 454.82s]  because I do that? By what? Doing what now? Putting food down the sink. All right. Yeah.
[456.68s -> 461.24s]  All right. There we go. Fight the aliens guys. Stop, stop talking.
[462.92s -> 468.78s]  If I have to, if I have to talk one more time, I just realized the bugs and then you shoot the
[468.78s -> 473.66s]  bugs. Yeah, I know, but I've got like a mega shield. I don't know. I don't know what I do
[473.66s -> 478.70s]  either. Actually. Yeah. Well, I have this cannon. I've got throwing so much shade and look in the
[478.70s -> 487.53s]  mirror. Look in the mirror. I cry for like an hour. That's why you never go into the hotel bathroom.
[487.53s -> 492.17s]  Okay. Make sure you pick up the red cases. By the way, I'm coming to a realization that playing,
[492.17s -> 497.77s]  like you said, wing diver on console is probably not a great idea. Yeah. I'm, I'm already using
[498.49s -> 505.54s]  sad control scheme. I get to shoot a lot of bullets. So mine's working pretty good. Yeah.
[505.54s -> 509.62s]  I mean, you're like slow and dumpy anyway. I am. Yeah. I got to figure out how to go fast.
[511.30s -> 516.90s]  All right. So, um, this is the one I need to be using. I need to be using the plasma cannon
[516.90s -> 526.54s]  for sure. More like street corridor defense force. This is just the first level. I put the bombs on
[526.54s -> 533.02s]  you. So you have to go in. Okay. Um, hopefully they're pointing the other direction pointing
[533.02s -> 541.02s]  the other direction. We have a GPS right now. Put the food down. There we go. That's the stuff.
[542.06s -> 552.92s]  Okay. Hey guys, head to the ground surface. Yeah. Look, have you got arrows? Yeah. Hurry up guys.
[554.78s -> 559.42s]  Team leader. We have to go fight these dinosaurs. They're not dinosaurs. They're not
[559.42s -> 566.94s]  fucking dinosaurs. I just hurt myself in the other room. How, how's that possible?
[567.58s -> 577.61s]  I just hurt myself in the room. Did that just happen? Hey, what do you, how loud are you?
[577.61s -> 582.73s]  I don't know. That might be too loud. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. I've been needing to get a new
[582.73s -> 587.77s]  headset for a long time because my audio leaks and you're a streamer. I know one thing about
[587.77s -> 593.53s]  you. Is there actually like a sprint button for me? Uh, left L3. Well, actually I think you get
[593.53s -> 599.53s]  like a dash. I think I can go by the way. I'm definitely going to get all the points here.
[599.53s -> 606.97s]  Yeah. I remember his dash being cancelable. I think your bombs exploded. Unfortunately.
[612.01s -> 618.84s]  There's health containers too. Oh, you guys are just making it over here. Hey guys. Yeah. You're
[618.84s -> 632.95s]  a lot faster. Yeah, I know. I forgot about that. Also my character only gets to shoot
[632.95s -> 639.03s]  like once every five seconds. Oh yeah. You're using like the vehicle guy, right? Yeah.
[641.05s -> 644.97s]  Do we get our own Diablo three loot systems part looting system here or is it do it? Am I
[644.97s -> 648.41s]  picking these up? Like if you pick up armor, you're taking it away from us. Am I actually?
[648.41s -> 652.09s]  And you're, yeah. And you're going to be picking it all up because you're way faster. Never going
[652.09s -> 658.30s]  to get looted. Oh shit. Well, you just need to get good. Oh, I can push the bugs around.
[659.10s -> 665.34s]  Doesn't, doesn't fence or have a, um, a dash like you go rocket feet. I do that once
[666.62s -> 673.99s]  armor is shared. We'll get there eventually. All right. Hey, the armor is shared.
[675.96s -> 680.63s]  So if somebody picks it up, it's shared between us all. We're going to just get in here and just
[680.71s -> 701.94s]  fucking lighten them up. Oh, oh, just defeat these enemies. I don't want to die like that.
[701.94s -> 704.82s]  Is health shared too? If I pick it up, is it like share between everybody?
[706.74s -> 716.68s]  Probably not. What did you just say? So it's not like I'm hurt or anything.
[718.60s -> 726.39s]  Wait, what are you? What did, what's that? What's the last part? Oh, okay. I don't know what those
[726.95s -> 740.98s]  are. Is it in the hive? Oh, they're on the ceiling. You killed them already. What do you think I'm
[740.98s -> 748.74s]  trying? So what is, what does flyboy do? What is it like? What does your class do besides glide?
[748.74s -> 754.26s]  Uh, it's like rockets for us then. Oh, fine. I'm fine. I'll do everything. I'll do it all.
[755.70s -> 762.60s]  So is armor permanent? Like, yes. Yeah, it is a permanent. Do you play it on?
[763.40s -> 767.08s]  So if you don't like the, this character, then very soon you need to figure out if you want to
[767.08s -> 776.28s]  switch. So there's four classes initially. What does that turn into by? Only four. There's like
[776.28s -> 784.86s]  a thousand weapons. But you unlock new weapons as you level up and stuff like that. Yeah. There's
[784.86s -> 792.52s]  only four classes, but there are hundreds and hundreds of weapons in the game. So it is not,
[792.52s -> 799.18s]  oh, only four classes. I get four abilities and an ultimate. Uh-uh. You get an ultimate. I don't
[799.18s -> 805.30s]  know. Why am I making like a MOBA reference? You don't like even play those. I want to play
[805.30s -> 811.38s]  those. It's not just MOBAs anymore. Uh, every single game has an ultimate ability now. That's,
[811.38s -> 819.62s]  I mean, that's kind of true. You know what? I'll hear that and raise you on every game. Also,
[819.62s -> 826.07s]  including like a boxed open. Is there loot crates in this game? There are. Oh, we have to go the
[826.07s -> 829.83s]  other. Why does he keep debating us? There are, because you just see I'm picking them up on the
[829.83s -> 836.97s]  ground. They don't have to pay for them though. So can I get those on the free to play model?
[838.63s -> 843.59s]  Yeah. Well, it's, it's free. It's free to play after you pay $60. Well, I paid 60 bucks. How
[843.59s -> 852.12s]  many keys do I get? I don't know. That star knows that more than I do. The reason my star is not
[852.12s -> 862.50s]  talking. He's got things to do. You got like a piece of ham stuck in your throat or something
[862.50s -> 868.68s]  there. Sure. I'm up. Pay attention. Monsters are coming from the hole. He's eating with his
[868.68s -> 875.11s]  mic muted. No, you're doing that. No, I want you to eat with the mic on so you can call out shots
[875.11s -> 880.71s]  to talk to my viewers about the questions they ask without interrupting your important conversation
[880.71s -> 891.37s]  that you were having. It was very important. Oh, there's the dash. Oh yeah. And our weapon boxes
[891.37s -> 897.85s]  that you need to find. Yeah. So here's a question for the chat room here. Uh, is, yeah. Are
[897.85s -> 902.65s]  because I've been, I picked up at least three of them. So are they shared to share? Good sick.
[902.65s -> 915.05s]  Nice. I've never played this game before. Uh, I figured out my dash. So far the tutorial was
[915.05s -> 921.45s]  definitely the best part. Earth corridor. If I complimented me like, oh, you can, you can talk
[921.45s -> 926.09s]  on the radio and you can summon vehicles and you can do all this. Someone must really trust you.
[926.09s -> 930.41s]  You must be a high ranked officer. And then you made me look left and right and told me I was
[930.41s -> 937.21s]  impressive for doing it. Well, you got a participation award. So I just had to get a
[937.21s -> 943.29s]  medal. So, well, I, the boy scouts watch out for monsters. Don't worry about stealing loot. All
[943.29s -> 948.10s]  right. That's cool. Right. You guys point them out. I'll get up there and I'll fly up there.
[953.05s -> 959.85s]  This base is too big for humans. It must be designed for mechas. I was about to say basically
[960.57s -> 966.25s]  they made this facility exclusively so it could be invaded by giant. Yeah. Yeah.
[967.21s -> 972.76s]  But it's a, it's supposed to be like that. Don't worry. I'm going to use the gun.
[972.76s -> 981.90s]  I don't like EDF because it's bad because they say bad dumb dialogue. That's part. That's part
[981.90s -> 989.93s]  of the allure. That's part of the lotster. They're singing. Be respectful.
[989.93s -> 994.50s]  Isn't there any response from the ground? That's what your character does.
[995.62s -> 1001.22s]  You just have a big lunchbox. Oh yeah. I got lunchboxes and inside the lunchbox is a gun.
[1009.13s -> 1012.73s]  Oh, how do you chant EDF? That just scared the shit out of me. What you just did. I thought you
[1012.73s -> 1019.77s]  were yelling. You have the, uh, the touch pad on PS4. Yeah. You're playing with regular menu.
[1019.77s -> 1026.92s]  Oh, there's that. Also, I think the d-pad has all the stuff in it. I'm sorry.
[1027.80s -> 1029.56s]  I think to do the whole song, you need the
[1033.77s -> 1040.41s]  voice so much louder. I like your pink Power Ranger costume by the way.
[1042.66s -> 1049.16s]  It's the lore. Oh, that's come on guys. Don't you dare. The least annoying voice in the game.
[1049.16s -> 1060.79s]  Part of the lotster. Oh my God. Your gun looks like you're about to refuel a car.
[1062.39s -> 1071.93s]  Gas pump. I'll see you have high heels, which is really, but I fly. I fly. So why do you have
[1071.93s -> 1075.93s]  high heels to get up to the air quicker? Touch the ground. So they're very comfortable because
[1075.93s -> 1078.81s]  he never has to walk. You don't know what those are. Those could be springboards.
[1086.02s -> 1089.46s]  I don't like playing this character because when I fly in the air, I don't hear all the fun dialogue
[1092.79s -> 1099.02s]  because why I don't hear all the fun dialogue because I'm too far away. Does it have simulated
[1099.02s -> 1105.58s]  5.1 surround sound boys? No, it's too far away. I'm just flying around and I'm up in the air and I
[1105.58s -> 1110.94s]  can't hear what he does saying. I feel like I need to be part of the amount of ammo and everything.
[1110.94s -> 1120.39s]  You just keep standing. No, I don't want to do that anymore. Thank you. All right. Shout out crates
[1120.39s -> 1124.55s]  if you see him because I got nothing else to do while my gun reloads for 30 seconds.
[1130.74s -> 1136.23s]  Console controls. Come on. Health pack. That's why I'm playing Air Raider Man
[1136.95s -> 1141.43s]  because vehicles don't feel like garbage to drive with a controller. So is the Ranger the only one
[1141.43s -> 1149.46s]  that can drive vehicles or? Oh, fuck. They're monsters. I was wondering that myself. I think
[1149.46s -> 1154.42s]  I can drive them and Rangers can drive them. Yeah. You can spawn them. I think Rangers can also drive
[1154.42s -> 1167.58s]  them. Yeah. Don't like Flyboy and you won't be able to use my wheel. I am the wheel. That would
[1167.58s -> 1182.28s]  be silly. All right. Shout out crates. I gotta eat this food. Will you stop eating? I haven't been
[1182.28s -> 1192.47s]  eating. I don't see any extra crates. Fun hating streamer refuses to spam voice lines. I'm a fun
[1192.47s -> 1204.06s]  streamer. See? I'm a hilarious streamer. See? And I apologize to you guys too. All right. I think
[1204.06s -> 1212.97s]  we've just beat level one. Quick, go into the light. He thinks if he doesn't get your attention
[1212.97s -> 1222.42s]  with one type of voice or like change his tone. Help. We did it. Ladies and gentlemen, that is
[1222.42s -> 1225.86s]  EDF. No, it's not. That's like bullshit. That was just like a shitty walk around in a hallway.
[1225.86s -> 1235.03s]  Mission complete. Game's over. This is what you play for. So it looks like we got a missile
[1235.03s -> 1240.87s]  launcher for the Ranger. Do we have the same screen? I think so. Yeah. Just total items acquired
[1240.87s -> 1246.55s]  here. Look at all my items I get to use next round. Yeah. You will launch a lot of new things.
[1246.55s -> 1253.34s]  Are we sure? Are we sure? I got three things. All right. Short range. I'm gonna take a look at
[1253.34s -> 1265.74s]  those. We got armor up. The power lance. There's so much text. Hold the trigger to fire it.
[1266.38s -> 1271.14s]  Power lance is in the short term. Yeah. There's a lot to look at here.
[1273.54s -> 1278.90s]  I just look at what the numbers are. You know what I mean? Yeah. But there's a lot of numbers.
[1278.90s -> 1285.54s]  I know. But like, yeah, like the rank of your equipment actually. Yeah. Is very important.
[1286.26s -> 1290.33s]  So if you have like one that's a four and one that's a zero. Just charge the casket.
[1290.97s -> 1294.17s]  It's a big deal. Long range laser gun. Actually I kind of like this.
[1294.89s -> 1299.67s]  Also snipe distant enemies. Firepower was lower but can destroy a target by continuously firing.
[1300.63s -> 1313.70s]  Accumulate energy by holding it down. Okay. Plasma core that specializes in flying.
[1314.26s -> 1320.66s]  Board acceleration has increased. Damn. There's so much. Dude, you can read. I look like a
[1320.66s -> 1326.47s]  disgruntled construction worker. Let me get here. I'm just orange and yellow with the
[1326.47s -> 1331.27s]  like safety vest. I'm ready. Whenever Jerm is ready because he's the one we're waiting for.
[1331.27s -> 1337.19s]  But I'm the one that just got like seven new items to look at. I think the items that we're
[1337.19s -> 1344.55s]  getting by the way are um, we all get the same amount but what items you get are. Oh okay. Yeah
[1344.55s -> 1349.51s]  because I got a whole bunch from me and I didn't see any for your quest. Let me try this thing.
[1349.51s -> 1354.95s]  I guess there was one new fencer item and two upgraded ones for me. I'm just gonna sit here
[1354.95s -> 1360.39s]  and eat while you guys talk about your little weapons you got. Hey I love the new Diablo
[1360.39s -> 1367.35s]  expansion. Oh you don't have phones? Just armor. Wait you can you can bring your armor down? Why
[1367.35s -> 1372.82s]  would you do that? I think it's to scale your slight to lower level people. I'm gonna make
[1372.82s -> 1393.62s]  the Jerma colors. Hold on. All right. Um I'm ready. Mission two. Um you guys ever use a
[1393.62s -> 1400.44s]  mortar before? Um mortar? Wrong colors. The light mortar. You don't think I know my own colors?
[1401.58s -> 1413.37s]  What? Try it out buddy. All right. I will. Yeah but I mean I can't. It's not gonna work guys.
[1414.01s -> 1422.92s]  There's not an entire that's as close as I'm gonna get it. More pink but there I can't select it. I
[1422.92s -> 1429.30s]  was told that I was the last one not ready. I'm being screamed at right now. Hold on. Oh you can
[1429.30s -> 1445.22s]  do triangle for whatever. I'll fix it later. I don't want anyone to yell at me. You will not fix
[1445.22s -> 1453.27s]  it and you know it. Okay everybody's muted right now. I just I looked over and the discord was
[1453.27s -> 1461.08s]  just muted. So I'm gonna mute too. Fine. All right what's this new weapon I got? Can I zoom in with
[1461.08s -> 1468.66s]  this? Oh how do I let go of this? Oh my god are those dinosaurs in the sky? How do I? Holy shit.
[1468.66s -> 1477.93s]  Okay this now. Welcome to EDF. This is a yes the proper mission. I'll get it. I'll get it.
[1480.50s -> 1487.67s]  Look at this guy. I don't remember how to come close. All right so this is like a little.
[1488.95s -> 1498.46s]  I actually like this gun. Please. What do you want me to do? I wanted to see if I could drive him.
[1498.46s -> 1524.12s]  Christmas presents hold on. Oh by the way for those of you all you guys watching right now
[1524.12s -> 1528.12s]  we are playing this is on normal difficulty because you want you have to really play
[1529.08s -> 1536.20s]  to collect the boxes first. Once you get enough boxes. Yeah that was a pretty big mistake too.
[1537.08s -> 1540.52s]  Because you could beat the starting missions on like very hard but after a while
[1541.48s -> 1546.76s]  you didn't have enough armor to beat the later missions. So what's the like highest
[1546.76s -> 1557.75s]  difficulty in the whole game? Inferno which is insane. God. Well that gun kind of is terrible.
[1560.14s -> 1565.82s]  Hey uh hey hey. Holy shit. Hey germamites am I like crazy or has that gone terrible?
[1567.45s -> 1569.85s]  Oh it's pretty bad man. I'm watching your stream too while I'm playing.
[1570.65s -> 1577.80s]  Yeah that's new. Did you just drop like an airstrip of bombs? Well you you you pressed
[1577.80s -> 1582.20s]  a call on the bomber and it gives like a it zooms you way out and you place it on the ground now
[1582.20s -> 1585.00s]  before you just like threw a smoke and guess where it was gonna go.
[1591.21s -> 1596.97s]  How much does first aid heal? Um does it heal everybody or just like the no it depends on how
[1596.97s -> 1601.05s]  big the box is. It's like maybe 10 for a little one and maybe 25 for a big one.
[1602.01s -> 1613.18s]  Let me see. Does this gun suck or what? I don't get it. I mean no guns should currently suck.
[1615.50s -> 1617.34s]  Just seems like it takes a long time to kill anyway.
[1625.02s -> 1631.58s]  Here we go. I'm calling in. I'm calling in the thing. I can't wait to see this. I'm so
[1631.58s -> 1635.10s]  excited for this. I hope it kills you. It's not gonna kill me. I'm not even over there.
[1635.90s -> 1639.58s]  Yeah also it never used to show allies where it was coming in before. Did you do that sir?
[1640.06s -> 1643.90s]  I did. What a cool character. I did that.
[1649.08s -> 1662.60s]  I wonder if this is like spear gun. Oh oh oh oh oh I like lost audio. There were so many explosions.
[1663.24s -> 1669.99s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Are you doing the green lasers?
[1669.99s -> 1677.93s]  I am. The green laser is not good. I'm doing it wrong. There's so much going on.
[1678.01s -> 1682.09s]  So well are all these like friendly mechs here pilotable or are they just like decorations?
[1682.09s -> 1690.14s]  I think they're decorations. They're sad because they're funny. Air raider you get like vehicles
[1690.14s -> 1695.98s]  later so I can summon those for other things. There's like megazords and crazy stuff. The
[1695.98s -> 1700.70s]  helicopters. My eyes. Oh hold on I'll get these. You guys stick with the plan.
[1701.42s -> 1707.96s]  This is a special news flash. There have been accounts of UFO sightings everywhere across the
[1708.76s -> 1714.92s]  globe. So how the hell if you don't have a winged diver in your party how on earth do you collect
[1714.92s -> 1724.36s]  items? You don't. You kind of just don't huh? I think I think like if I had a tank or one of
[1724.36s -> 1732.20s]  the jeeps I could do it. Oh yeah you can get a ventral now. Should I get them all?
[1733.16s -> 1742.66s]  Okay incoming another way. Ranger can sprint and get to the loot radius now. That's cool.
[1743.46s -> 1746.34s]  And these upgrades to aerator are really nice.
[1751.16s -> 1755.30s]  I'm just realizing this is using my jetpack. That's why I don't like it.
[1755.94s -> 1762.34s]  So I guess you have like a limited amount you can just fly around and just get to like land
[1762.42s -> 1770.10s]  birds. Yeah it's it's kind of like it's like a standard jetpack in video game where it has a bar.
[1772.82s -> 1777.96s]  It's clear. Yeah I like this thing but I don't like the I'm gonna replace this button.
[1779.93s -> 1783.29s]  Don't for some of you guys. Oh my god. Some of you guys would like the long range I think.
[1783.85s -> 1795.37s]  You'd like the longer range and a little more direct control. But me I'm not like that. You're
[1795.37s -> 1807.40s]  super cool. Thanks man. Hey why don't you pick up this armor? I'm going for it. There's a lot to
[1807.40s -> 1815.40s]  pick up. Oh my god there's a lot over here actually. Get that weapon. Oh I got it. I got it.
[1816.58s -> 1820.55s]  Okay we're good. Wow they give you five seconds after the mission's over huh?
[1822.31s -> 1827.35s]  Look at oh okay it's definitely shared but there's quite a bias here. Okay I'm I don't know about
[1827.35s -> 1834.17s]  that. Hey uh who's the new player? Is that me the fencer? That seems like pretty heavy bias. Oh
[1834.17s -> 1840.33s]  really? What do you mean? I think I picked the correct class here. Uh do you not see the items
[1840.33s -> 1844.49s]  acquired? I'm gonna need about uh that's what I said earlier is that there are minutes or so if
[1844.49s -> 1849.69s]  that's okay? It depends on your character like I got a whole bunch of air raider stuff. You did?
[1850.25s -> 1854.17s]  I got a whole bunch of fencer stuff. Yeah because of what I'm playing. I got a couple of other
[1854.17s -> 1858.09s]  classes things but the majority is it is going to be the class you're playing. I got combat
[1858.09s -> 1862.73s]  bombers out here. So we've got class specific loot. Yeah that's plus one letter grade at least. Oh
[1862.73s -> 1868.73s]  okay but don't call me down. No one listens to me. No I was listening to you but then like I heard
[1868.73s -> 1874.33s]  you listen wait wait wait listens but Italics last mission you were like just ignored you but
[1874.33s -> 1880.20s]  last mission you were like oh I didn't get anything or I didn't get shit. Didn't you say
[1880.20s -> 1885.64s]  that? I did not say that. I got three new things. What the fuck is happening? You're hallucinating.
[1886.36s -> 1899.66s]  Oh this is better. So they actually have the star system here. Everybody make their new character.
[1901.40s -> 1904.92s]  Yeah the fun thing about the game is that like pretty much every mission you get
[1904.92s -> 1909.96s]  pretty much every class plays with. Yeah pretty much every class. Yeah it's really she had it
[1909.96s -> 1913.96s]  fine. Super well balanced. I can't wait till the PvP mode comes up. There's so many items.
[1914.92s -> 1920.30s]  It's just like a giant toy box of different weapons. When are they going to release the
[1920.30s -> 1937.88s]  cowboy character? Thrown by hand. Shotgun. Oh I got to use the gun. You can't be ready. We just
[1937.88s -> 1946.02s]  got eight new weapons. I can only put like one of them just come on man. The game doesn't even
[1946.02s -> 1950.90s]  start until I get a vehicle. This thing I don't like this thing at all. So let me change this
[1951.14s -> 1956.42s]  thing at least. Yeah I basically am Bob. I'm playing Bob the Builder. It's probably a shotgun.
[1956.42s -> 1967.18s]  Like why the heck not? Charge. Maximum energy. Maybe you can tell me this. I have two hammers.
[1967.18s -> 1976.76s]  They're close range weapons. If I'm so slow how do you use melee? How do you use melee? Yeah I have
[1976.76s -> 1982.20s]  two hammers. I could do like dual with the old hammers. I'm telling you like one of the items
[1982.20s -> 1986.44s]  that you got I think it might have been the shield. Someone who's a brilliant gamer at this
[1986.44s -> 1992.36s]  game let me know what that brilliant gamer the uh the big boy do the dash cancel so you could
[1992.36s -> 1998.71s]  fly around everywhere. I think it was any melee weapon you would need equipped and then you would
[1998.71s -> 2007.61s]  have a a dash cancel ability. Lances. Yeah I remember lances being able to do it maybe. Shield
[2007.61s -> 2021.32s]  lances yeah. Shield lets you dash cancel. Yeah so mess around with trying to trying to do that.
[2021.32s -> 2030.89s]  Yeah it's lances. This game is fucking fun as hell. We're saying deflect shield. Don't you guys
[2030.89s -> 2041.08s]  think this game is just fun as hell? No. They patched the dash cancel apparently. Says somebody
[2041.08s -> 2049.72s]  over here. They better not have. Fucking blizzard is always like ruining their game with fixing
[2049.72s -> 2057.10s]  bugs that were fun. Oh by the way we didn't even get a we didn't even get a star underscore
[2057.66s -> 2063.82s]  reaction to Diablo Immortal. You didn't? No we didn't. We played like Lethal League and then
[2063.82s -> 2068.70s]  you rage quit and left. I thought I talked to you about it. We didn't get like an on camera response.
[2068.70s -> 2072.62s]  On camera response? Yeah we played Lethal League and you rage quit and I haven't talked to you in
[2072.62s -> 2078.87s]  like three weeks. Oh it's been three weeks? It's been when did Lethal League come out?
[2079.51s -> 2085.59s]  Well I didn't miss you. I said that it was clearly Mike Morhaime did the right thing
[2086.47s -> 2095.69s]  by stepping down and he picked a very good time to get out and it's only going to get worse.
[2097.02s -> 2103.50s]  It's sad. Are we talking about blizzard drama? It's sad. Yeah sad. Look at the sky. Dude you're
[2103.50s -> 2107.42s]  fucking huge. That cloud looks like a like an ostrich.
[2112.23s -> 2117.75s]  I was trying look at how cool that is. I gotta have a new bow. I think we have to destroy it.
[2121.99s -> 2126.95s]  I don't know. Okay this is this is my move now. This thing is cool. This is also my move.
[2131.21s -> 2134.81s]  I only have 10 bullets each. I'm bombing them both. Get out of the way.
[2135.21s -> 2141.62s]  Get I trust you'll get out of the way. Get out of the way. Oh that way. Get out of that way.
[2142.58s -> 2153.56s]  You missed me good. Can I go in the red circle now? I'm out of juice. Mommy yeah.
[2154.20s -> 2164.26s]  Eat shit. Watch this one baby. That's so fun. I can just charge them up. Doesn't seem very effective.
[2166.02s -> 2170.23s]  I missed this game. If I knew we were going to be fighting pylons I would have gone like the
[2170.23s -> 2173.83s]  single target mortar thing. Should we be focusing the pylons or the ants?
[2174.63s -> 2181.58s]  Probably the pylon at this point. I'm shooting the pylon. Well I'm getting the stuff.
[2181.58s -> 2186.30s]  That soldier just said body shot. Like he was something I fucking body shot me.
[2187.58s -> 2195.18s]  I'm calling in more bombs. Oh come on. I only have one booster. Does that mean friendly fire is on?
[2196.38s -> 2200.06s]  Actually I don't think friendly fire comes on until like on the higher difficulties.
[2200.06s -> 2205.05s]  That might you might have you might be on to something there. Oh yeah because I was
[2205.05s -> 2209.61s]  boiling up explosives on italics when he was fine. That's true you did line me with explosives.
[2209.61s -> 2218.47s]  Yeah I don't think you need to worry about it. The lightning gun is actually really fun. It
[2218.47s -> 2231.66s]  spreads everywhere. It uses a lot of resources though. I'm shooting a stationary target over
[2231.66s -> 2238.89s]  and over again. My stream is loving this game. This is a fun game. Oh my goodness there's a herping.
[2240.70s -> 2247.27s]  Wait you have herpes? Oh I can charge the hammers. Don't wait on me. Wait what?
[2248.63s -> 2252.81s]  There's like so many goodies in there and I can't get in there. Charge it all the way up.
[2253.61s -> 2264.01s]  All right I got them all. Another pylon. I love the dialogue in this game. Will we bring in more
[2264.01s -> 2272.07s]  monsters? I think this is it guys. We kill them we save the world. What is that song? Yeah what is
[2272.07s -> 2277.59s]  playing? I thought one of you was like playing. You got to go to the other pylon. I'm on the way.
[2281.19s -> 2287.43s]  It is said to be 10 meters long, extremely aggressive, and will most likely attack humans.
[2287.43s -> 2291.83s]  Stay tuned for more updates. Uh oh something's going to attack humans. Something's going to go
[2291.83s -> 2295.91s]  after the humans. I swear to god if you're not picking up all the weapon boxes Jerma.
[2296.71s -> 2307.51s]  I am doing my work okay. All right so attack the upper part. Yeah yeah dude the purple thing at the
[2307.51s -> 2314.15s]  top. All right I got some time here too. Let's get up there. Watch this point blank eat shit.
[2314.15s -> 2323.86s]  Watch this one. You're doing the objective. Oh god I had to have done at least two damage there.
[2323.94s -> 2331.85s]  Guys had you been hitting the bottom part of it? No I was yes. Hitting the bottom part of what?
[2332.49s -> 2337.69s]  The pylon. Yeah I have. Yeah we both have it. So it's not just me. Yeah it's not just me.
[2340.18s -> 2343.06s]  To be fair my weapon can only hit the bottom part of the pylon.
[2343.94s -> 2349.50s]  Yeah how's this for the bottom part of the pylon?
[2352.94s -> 2357.54s]  Oh I thought you were talking. Yeah I just did it. I thought you were being naughty.
[2358.18s -> 2373.99s]  What the fuck? What where am I? Yes sir. All right I'm good. All right did I get all the boxes in there?
[2375.85s -> 2379.82s]  It'll cause casualties but not only that casualties.
[2384.47s -> 2387.51s]  All right I gotta move. All right there are boxes over here. Sorry guys.
[2387.51s -> 2403.80s]  Do you think I'm supposed to travel abroad next week? All right now I can actually help.
[2404.44s -> 2413.85s]  I'm coming. Oh no. The last EDF like four the monsters had been dormant but this game now
[2413.85s -> 2419.13s]  like everyone doesn't know what they are again. What are they? It's a full reboot.
[2420.81s -> 2426.95s]  We rebooted the lore. It's true. It really is true. Man and I read the whole wiki before
[2426.95s -> 2435.42s]  this game just to prepare. No it's monsters. Weapons.
[2436.22s -> 2440.54s]  I need to get some more fuel in the tank.
[2441.98s -> 2445.42s]  Also I think it's safe to assume that in this world ants don't exist
[2445.42s -> 2450.15s]  because no one knew what ants were when they showed up. They said they were dinosaurs.
[2450.95s -> 2457.03s]  What are they? Dinosaurs? They would technically not be ants unless they were enlarged by some kind
[2457.03s -> 2461.43s]  of reverse shrink ray right? They would be like because they look the same doesn't mean they're
[2461.43s -> 2467.19s]  the same. I think we get it.
[2480.71s -> 2486.98s]  I love this game. Here come more pylons. I love the double hammers you got there.
[2487.62s -> 2495.24s]  Oh my god. I imagine if we started on hard. Hey guys start on hard like we did last time.
[2498.18s -> 2506.63s]  Yeah that's the they said we got to retreat. I wonder what we got what's inside of our boxes.
[2511.29s -> 2514.89s]  Dude you didn't pick up any weapon boxes. There weren't any.
[2515.69s -> 2519.82s]  There was a shitload of armor boxes. We only got four weapons this time. They weren't they were
[2520.06s -> 2523.82s]  only like three or four. Look at the amount of armor. Look at the HP that I gave you.
[2530.22s -> 2537.64s]  I got another spark vine. Is this new? Could you get better versions of the same weapon before?
[2538.52s -> 2543.64s]  What? Yeah. You could? I don't remember this kind of upgrading part where you can pick up
[2543.64s -> 2549.96s]  better versions of the same weapon. Yeah one of the reasons we never noticed it is because we
[2549.96s -> 2555.48s]  started on like the hard difficulty so we had the best versions of every weapon. Oh okay makes
[2555.48s -> 2566.26s]  sense. So what does a star mean next to level? I don't know. If level is the most important
[2566.26s -> 2570.98s]  factor. This thing is cool. There's like an empty star number too. Yeah I've been looking
[2570.98s -> 2575.62s]  at it. It's been confusing me. Okay literally the first weapon of the that I see here in chat is
[2575.62s -> 2585.10s]  what I'm gonna pick. I don't care what it is. Like there's something on this list. Sparks. Okay.
[2585.10s -> 2595.11s]  Flog. I'm really confused. Oh it means it's for me. It's a star. I like the the shotgun's really
[2595.11s -> 2607.46s]  cool but I'm gonna try the grenade. I'm gonna try missile launchers. I'm gonna try readying up.
[2609.14s -> 2632.38s]  I don't know how to do that. Chut up. No you chuddle. No you chuddle. It's always a talent.
[2632.46s -> 2638.68s]  I can't help it. You gave me too much power.
[2642.06s -> 2646.22s]  Why can you do that? Why are there like 30 different versions of ha ha ha?

[2743.85s -> 2753.86s]  favorite weapon now. I'm actually becoming a Gundam. Dude. That's just kind of hard to aim on console.
[2753.86s -> 2763.70s]  It doesn't matter it's gonna go bot. That's what I was trying to do. Bingo. Um I'll just for well
[2763.70s -> 2769.91s]  yeah this film's really good at killing pylons. I'm on I'm on pylon duty. All right I'm gonna be on

[2794.12s -> 2800.28s]  someone who is like seven years younger than you boomers too? I don't know. Oh what? You can't
[2800.28s -> 2809.67s]  stand on the tank. I don't know. People just say it to me in a very in a very mean way.

[2857.34s -> 2867.22s]  everything that I need to know. Yeah you probably do. This is really hard to aim. It just kind of
[2867.22s -> 2873.24s]  is and how. Wait that didn't. That's L2. That's really weird. Watch out there's a new pylon.
[2874.65s -> 2889.86s]  That camera switch is like. Yeah. Like it. I feel like you probably got asked a lot of questions
[2889.86s -> 2895.06s]  and didn't AMA. Oh you said it was just for us. Yeah you said it was just for us. That was the
[2895.06s -> 2905.54s]  only question in my AMA. What is this indicator. There's nothing that I care enough about. Are you
[2905.54s -> 2911.14s]  sure. Yeah. There's nothing that you want to ask anything. I mean I'm talking anything. This is

[2937.51s -> 2941.59s]  Dude if like someone gave me a way to stream from a phone then I didn't have to figure out myself
[2941.67s -> 2948.15s]  100 percent. It's very very easy. You just need to get them down. Just get the it's just the HDI
[2950.15s -> 2955.91s]  it's the HDMI adapter for like apples. You just go to the apple store you pay like the forty five
[2955.91s -> 2962.42s]  dollars for this piece of plastic and you just plug in HDMI to it and plug that into like a
[2962.42s -> 2970.26s]  capture card. That's it. I'm ready. Oh dude I actually you tried to play with me one time
[2970.26s -> 2976.74s]  20 years ago. The media and Excel. Yes. You know media and Excel is getting like a
[2976.74s -> 2981.06s]  an HD remastered kind of thing coming out. Interesting. You know that I downloaded that
[2981.06s -> 2988.74s]  like four like five days ago. Not even good. I'll prove it to him. He hasn't been pitching
[2988.74s -> 2994.26s]  about the Diablo for at least three weeks now. That's correct. What's the Diablo. All of it.
[2994.98s -> 2999.94s]  What what do you explain yourself. Diablo mortal thing and I was like what the heck.
[3001.46s -> 3007.22s]  Oh well media and Excel things coming out too. Hey I look I'm going to prove to you.

[3021.94s -> 3026.50s]  coming out with like the new version of it that has like it's the HD remastered better than
[3026.50s -> 3031.78s]  Blizzard could ever do it version. Really. Yeah it's getting like the skills are being remapped
[3031.78s -> 3037.86s]  like all the UI is on. They built a new engine. It's a widescreen. I thought it didn't just release.
[3037.86s -> 3042.18s]  It didn't that just happen or is that something else. No they just announced it so that's coming
[3042.18s -> 3046.98s]  out in January. Um okay. They've been working on that for a long time. That sounds like fun.
[3046.98s -> 3050.26s]  I would highly recommend you try it with me because I'm down to.
[3051.06s -> 3057.62s]  And I know all the you need the ins and outs. Yeah I did install the the original one.
[3059.53s -> 3065.13s]  The original one I know I can I can prove to you know what despite what I said the day that the
[3065.13s -> 3069.93s]  Diablo thing was announced I also installed the game except I installed path of exile.
[3070.89s -> 3079.30s]  Yeah well median xl like the guy who made median xl did a lot of work on path of exile.
[3079.30s -> 3084.01s]  What is going on over here? It's a lot like path of exile. You should try it too italics.
[3084.01s -> 3087.21s]  I'm converting everyone. What are we doing? Is there are we waiting for something?
[3087.21s -> 3089.69s]  Shoot the UFO or they're dropping bad guys in.
[3092.25s -> 3097.05s]  Building just collapsed and I'm standing. Yeah I've launched rockets at it. Hit it.
[3097.05s -> 3106.82s]  Hit it right in the middle. They're dropping down like CDs. Yeah it's just a disc shooter
[3106.82s -> 3116.07s]  from like the 90s 90s boomers. I mean there's a game that was on ps2 so. I missed a weapon
[3116.07s -> 3120.47s]  crate I was too big whatever. I can't do all the work. You know he missed a weapon crate.
[3121.19s -> 3129.34s]  Uh people is see it. If they show up his w's on the map. Plasma big. We're about to get this w.
[3129.98s -> 3136.87s]  Oh I didn't get anything new. I'm ready. An up way. Oh another one. Oh another one.
[3139.54s -> 3143.30s]  All right so I did but I'm not going to be the last one to ready this time. What am I doing?
[3144.10s -> 3150.66s]  Wait does it say what we're fighting? That would be really nice if it did.
[3150.66s -> 3157.16s]  I don't know. Oh the flying objects. Oh god. Pulse machine gun. I kind of want to try it.
[3157.88s -> 3173.77s]  All right the first thing that I see in chat. Uh machine gun. Wait this is the two different
[3173.93s -> 3179.72s]  it's just this one. No I want to get rid of this. It's too hard to aim on console.
[3180.60s -> 3191.43s]  All right I'm going to try that again. Oh god Jerma. I got a lot of new stuff.
[3191.99s -> 3195.43s]  I'm ready. It's going to be flying enemies. You're not even ready.
[3195.43s -> 3199.19s]  Why are you complaining to me? Because I'm waiting for you. I was looking at things
[3199.19s -> 3203.83s]  because you were looking at things. It perpetuates itself. You can't be mad at me
[3203.83s -> 3211.29s]  because you were also looking at your equipment. Isn't that the whole point of playing this game?
[3212.49s -> 3219.21s]  Kind of. Oh new weapon. Spiders. I remember these. I hate these. New weapon spiders.
[3219.21s -> 3225.56s]  I hate these things. I fucking hate them. They're so scary. Oh the ones that like shoot webs
[3225.56s -> 3232.76s]  and everything. They make really creepy noises. Plasma big cannon. Yes this spaceship was made
[3232.76s -> 3243.80s]  by Russians. That's a big cannon. What are those? Oh god actual boomers in chat. Zoom in.
[3247.48s -> 3253.56s]  Oh what are those? I don't think this is I don't think I have a good load-up for this level.
[3253.56s -> 3257.56s]  Actually laugh at that. Dude I said it was going to be flying enemies like three times
[3257.56s -> 3260.28s]  so that you would be ready for this. Shut up you fucking boomer. Fuck.
[3263.16s -> 3266.44s]  There is nothing that I like about you. Actually this is this is pretty good.
[3274.87s -> 3284.06s]  I'm taking out saucers man. Oh we're taking this. Plasma big cannon.
[3289.91s -> 3292.73s]  That's the kind of noise you would actually make if that happened to you.
[3295.48s -> 3301.22s]  So what does air support do right now? Don't you have like jets you can call into like
[3301.22s -> 3304.02s]  How do I turn this off? I think they were shooting through the thing.
[3305.14s -> 3312.28s]  It looked like they were. Oh it's where okay. I kind of enjoy just one-shotting all these.
[3313.24s -> 3316.36s]  Yeah it's shooting through the big ship. I like it's not there.
[3316.36s -> 3324.63s]  That wasn't boxes. I don't see any boxes. This one. Why does my shotgun have knockback on these?
[3325.43s -> 3336.34s]  That's cool it like tracks the saucers. Holy shit that was scary. I'm gonna I'm going to die.
[3336.98s -> 3342.95s]  I'm going to die. Do I need to come over? I need I need to find help is what needs to happen.
[3342.95s -> 3346.47s]  How do you shoot a major pulse cannon and miss every single enemy that are disconnected and
[3346.47s -> 3355.06s]  if they did again. Maybe if you were just picking up boxes like I told you to dead.
[3355.06s -> 3359.06s]  I'm dead. I'm down. Taleks to your right. We may have another problem.
[3359.06s -> 3365.88s]  Taleks is almost down too. Yeah that's why I'm running over to a stir. Star. Star.
[3365.88s -> 3368.76s]  Yeah I'm right next to him. At least I was like. Can I press you guys?
[3368.76s -> 3377.11s]  We got annihilated. They're just crashing into each other.
[3378.63s -> 3382.15s]  They're just smashing into each other. Press the vehicle rescue button. What the
[3382.15s -> 3385.19s]  fuck is the vehicle rescue button? Look just press every button okay.
[3386.95s -> 3391.99s]  Thank you. All right now me. Now give me some heals. Are you in support?
[3393.77s -> 3400.01s]  They're just crashing into each other. Thank you. I'm gonna die because you're dead again.
[3402.26s -> 3410.50s]  Well there is health right there. You just got it. I'm dead. What's the rescue button? It's circled.
[3410.74s -> 3417.37s]  Or they will attack civilians destroyed. Yeah we're in a lot of trouble here.
[3420.28s -> 3424.36s]  Any more health? I can't tell. I did enjoy being alive for an extra 15 seconds.
[3425.16s -> 3431.34s]  I get it. Ataleks you're dead in your bed. Excuse me. I'm coming. Wait.
[3431.34s -> 3436.46s]  Who's being resurrected right now? I'm coming. Not me. What are you talking about?
[3437.18s -> 3440.06s]  Then why do you have one HP? I have three.
[3440.62s -> 3443.58s]  I'm sorry. Did I get you?
[3446.62s -> 3457.64s]  You gotta be in this underhang. Oh I have three health. You actually do just have to be in this
[3457.64s -> 3464.46s]  underhang. Yeah it's actually been working really well. I'm coming. So there is friendly fire
[3464.46s -> 3470.14s]  if you do the explosion on yourself. So are we just gonna just cheese under the fucking sneeze
[3470.14s -> 3488.74s]  guard? Okay I see health. I'm going for it in a second. All right I'm back to kind of normal here.
[3501.77s -> 3505.66s]  What just happened to me? What did you just do? Did you just shoot a...
[3506.30s -> 3511.67s]  I just had 75 health and I'm at zero. What happened over there? Fucking guys are on your own.
[3511.67s -> 3521.26s]  Because it's your fault. Okay you aggroed all the enemies. If you had been picking up more armor
[3521.26s -> 3526.78s]  we wouldn't be in this situation. Oh he's shot. I can see them from here. Oh yeah? I don't think
[3526.78s -> 3533.18s]  we'd get them if we lose the mission. We don't. I'm dead. I'm on the roof too. Good luck getting me.
[3536.36s -> 3540.36s]  No one's gonna get me up here. I'm done. Nobody's shot me in a long time so I might just stay here
[3540.36s -> 3549.30s]  and not come get you. Yeah. Fucking roof. Oh god. I did so much. Figuring it out. I killed myself.
[3550.66s -> 3559.70s]  Hang on. Hold on. I got a shield. Welcome to EDF. Can you guys destroy the building behind you?
[3560.42s -> 3565.42s]  Come to me. All right go find another safe place and blow up this building.
[3567.99s -> 3572.07s]  No we're winning the mission. Yeah we kind of... this kind of worked out. You're not gonna beat
[3572.07s -> 3577.27s]  this. They're starting to get under here. Yeah they're like going. They're surfing on the concrete.
[3577.27s -> 3585.51s]  We're gonna beat the mission. Uh no. Remember last game too. The first mission where we started losing
[3585.51s -> 3594.68s]  was when they uh all the fucking flying things. Oh yeah I remember. Retreat or restart. Waiting
[3594.68s -> 3600.12s]  for the host to make a selection. Yeah retreat or restart. Um just try it again. This time we'll be
[3600.12s -> 3604.76s]  prepared. Just get ready for the saucers. I wouldn't mind switching weapons. Oh okay well
[3604.76s -> 3619.00s]  then we'll switch weapons. I was a bit rushed. Oh well we did get some armor. Yeah that's not
[3619.00s -> 3632.84s]  that idea. Maybe lightning bow. Lightning bow or that spark vine is good. I think I can just I
[3633.56s -> 3642.57s]  I don't know. I'm gonna get the bombers and hope that they do things. This thing is too big. Um
[3646.50s -> 3661.83s]  no it's got its use. It does. I want a vehicle drama. So pick it up. Or no you're right hold on.
[3662.94s -> 3673.56s]  That would be good here. I just got a bunch of zigguns. First one ready. Let the court know.
[3674.28s -> 3682.17s]  So what'd you guys do on your Sunday? What's today? My Sunday? What'd you guys do on your Wednesday?
[3683.78s -> 3690.10s]  You realize we live in the same house right? No I'm not. I know what you did today. It's today
[3690.10s -> 3695.62s]  Wednesday. Today's Wednesday. What'd you do on this Wednesday? I did a lot of stuff. I cannot
[3695.62s -> 3701.88s]  talk about it on the stream. People saying that you're quiet. How is that possible? Speak star.
[3703.35s -> 3713.42s]  Speak. I'm speaking. Speak. Speaks. This is an example of speaks. Now Alex you talk. Do it
[3713.42s -> 3718.86s]  right or I'm coming over there to scream in your mic. I'm gonna be loud and then quiet and this
[3718.86s -> 3722.38s]  is normal okay. I'm coming over to scream as loud as I can on your mic if you don't do it.
[3723.35s -> 3731.62s]  Oh I'm just what did I just do? Oh he did it okay. We're good. Go scream EDF.
[3734.46s -> 3738.94s]  Oh also we do only have three people. Scream as loud as you can and see if you can hear it on mine.
[3739.66s -> 3756.89s]  Let's see if this helps a little. Let's see if it helps. Go peak italics' mic. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
[3756.89s -> 3764.82s]  Hold on. Oh fuck. All right you guys should be good now. Oh fuck. Are you ready? Oh fuck.
[3765.70s -> 3771.06s]  What are you doing? I am. I am. I am. But fuck. I'm changing stuff. I'm good. Uh oh. No. Good. Good.
[3771.06s -> 3774.42s]  Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Everything's good.
[3774.42s -> 3784.17s]  I guess I'm a lefty now. Okay so I got the shot. This is going to help a lot. I will take care of
[3784.17s -> 3792.65s]  the monsters coming up from the ship. I didn't hit one shot. All you have to do is just like
[3792.65s -> 3808.30s]  hit things and also not die. Oh this is definitely the weapon. I'm not even going to equip the other
[3808.30s -> 3816.60s]  one for any reason. Yeah. I think we just hide under here the whole time to be honest.
[3818.44s -> 3829.98s]  Start. We're dropping bombs already. Yeah. So if the aliens attack but the air support specialist
[3829.98s -> 3834.78s]  bombs the entire city anyways. Yeah it goes through them. Did we actually save anything?
[3836.12s -> 3842.81s]  Um no I'm bombing the street and the street is fine. That's just uh. Like as long as we hang out
[3842.81s -> 3847.77s]  under here and I bomb the street then we're good because they kept bunching up on the streets.
[3851.45s -> 3857.46s]  I'm in my own little world over here. You guys have fun. It feels like playing a different video
[3857.46s -> 3870.28s]  game. Yeah that's that's always how that class feels. Humans. Humans. Uh oh. Uh oh.
[3871.08s -> 3879.16s]  I need to recharge for a second. Did he just say if we let them run rampage?
[3880.04s -> 3890.74s]  They're gonna run rampant. No he said run rampage. If we let them run rampage.
[3894.12s -> 3899.61s]  I don't know if it's such a good idea under here. Oh my. Ow. I don't know if this is a good idea.
[3902.06s -> 3904.78s]  Which part? All three of us standing in the same place.
[3907.70s -> 3913.56s]  We can risk each other very easily. I'm going out. Don't worry I got knocked back. See that's why
[3913.56s -> 3919.16s]  because we just got fucking collateral right there. Well you keep flying around then and just
[3919.80s -> 3925.24s]  don't get hit. Do you know how hard this is to do in that game? I kind of just have to stand still.
[3925.24s -> 3937.08s]  That's a weapon crit I gotta get. That's sort of what I do. Attacked. Oh we just got permission.
[3937.08s -> 3941.16s]  I don't know what we've been doing up until now. Attack the flying saucers. Let the government go
[3941.16s -> 3951.86s]  ahead. Ow that hurt. I can hear that all the way over here. Good. And it's starting to bug me.
[3952.58s -> 3959.56s]  Get it? Oh get it. Do they really just give you like constant news reports?
[3962.44s -> 3967.64s]  This is like um playing fallout where you get all the like data disks.
[3972.73s -> 3975.21s]  This is how they tell their story. We're doing a lot better.
[3975.21s -> 3985.53s]  Oh come on man. Don't embarrass me on my own stream. Everything's getting very quiet. Yeah.
[3986.89s -> 4002.26s]  I thought I was losing my hearing. Easy. Here come more. You're just singing down here.
[4004.79s -> 4011.51s]  Why do I have a different voice every time though? Because you're like Darth Vader. It's muffled in
[4014.60s -> 4025.96s]  Oh. Oh no. Oh no guys. What? Are you fine? Are you losing?
[4031.78s -> 4041.38s]  Is it your fault we're losing? No. What? There's a med kit. I feel like my deflection shield isn't
[4041.38s -> 4052.07s]  really deflecting much. Yeah it's because you're. Oh my god. Oh my god. He's not fun for me. I even
[4052.07s -> 4058.89s]  have a shield. I'm still dead. Oh my god. I just took so much damage. Oh I died on the
[4058.89s -> 4068.82s]  fucking roof again. Oh god damn it. Yeah there this is the wave where it's not possible currently.
[4068.82s -> 4072.74s]  Well we can run the other missions get more armor and you know maybe get better
[4073.94s -> 4080.31s]  equipment. I don't have the best anti-air equipment. That is correct. Get the clean
[4080.31s -> 4084.79s]  crates. It was hard when you get out of cover and a hundred ships surround you and you die in three
[4084.79s -> 4096.70s]  hits. Are you making fun of me? What? No I'm just saying our strategy is flawed. I don't have a
[4096.70s -> 4106.01s]  strategy. I think you're. Oh dude yeah I could use the bunker. Standing in the same place but to
[4106.01s -> 4110.71s]  spread out. Haven't you guys ever seen harbor before? We don't need to spread out. I have the
[4110.71s -> 4115.91s]  electromagnetic bunker. It creates a shield that can't be shot through but we can shoot through.
[4116.47s -> 4120.31s]  So it can. And we all just stand in the same spot. Well shut up italics. No one likes you.
[4121.96s -> 4125.00s]  Whoa no one likes being wrong either apparently.
[4130.68s -> 4134.44s]  Hold on a second. What did Ashley put in your food earlier?
[4135.70s -> 4138.50s]  Poison. It's rat poison. Hold on a minute here.
[4140.74s -> 4145.46s]  Hold on. Here guys we're going again. Not rat poison. What do you mean? Wait wait wait listen
[4145.46s -> 4156.81s]  listen to this listen. We go again. I also have I have a life vendor. You know what that does. It
[4156.81s -> 4163.61s]  supplies hit points to my allies. Your voice is very loud and fucked up right now. Why is my voice
[4163.61s -> 4167.69s]  fucked up? I don't know. I don't know what you did. You like plugged in a different mic. He's just
[4167.69s -> 4172.66s]  leaning in. Can you ready up italics? Why are we doing this again on the same level? Yeah we're
[4172.66s -> 4180.50s]  doing it again. We go again. I don't know. I told you this. Listen. They can't shoot us. I have
[4180.50s -> 4188.90s]  healing. We stand under thing. It's fine. What is exactly what we did last time except there was a
[4188.90s -> 4195.58s]  healing item. You're gonna be in big trouble after this. The barrier and the healing. What do you mean
[4195.58s -> 4206.33s]  we go? I'm ready. If we lose this time it's just probably italics. No it would be you actually
[4206.41s -> 4213.21s]  because. Will it be you? You're the one that we're depending on. Will it be me or will it be me?
[4217.64s -> 4226.57s]  Nice whiffs man. Okay when it gets to that phase we all have to we go under the thing.
[4227.21s -> 4232.95s]  Okay get to the phase go in the thing. Get to the phase go in the thing. Dude this is
[4232.95s -> 4239.82s]  on normal difficulty too. You understand? I understand this is normal. I understand we're
[4239.82s -> 4247.35s]  missing a player because you don't have any friends. Wait is that some kind of jab?
[4247.91s -> 4254.07s]  There are two players currently here in the same household. So where's your second? Because there's
[4254.07s -> 4261.40s]  a plus one invitation. I invited you and German didn't invite anyone. Was I supposed to invite
[4261.40s -> 4268.86s]  somebody else? Okay okay let's get under. Everyone under. We're gonna test the strat. I don't know
[4268.86s -> 4273.74s]  how this gets deployed. I can't wait until we all die. God that's it. Yeah great girl. It was
[4273.74s -> 4279.18s]  actually I who invited you by the way. Just so we're clear. Can we shoot through this? Yes.
[4287.34s -> 4292.06s]  All right this stupid strategy is gonna work. How often do you put those down? How long does
[4292.06s -> 4297.02s]  shield last for I guess? I have no idea. I have to get out there and pick up stuff though every
[4297.02s -> 4301.82s]  on a periodic basis. Well once it ends all the stuff to pick up is gonna be out here.
[4302.78s -> 4308.62s]  All right one shield down. We're gonna someone's gonna blow up. I'm gonna kill us. I can already
[4308.62s -> 4313.91s]  guarantee it. I gotta get out of here. I can't stay near you guys. You claustrophobic or something?
[4313.91s -> 4321.54s]  No I have like explosives. What's what? Why don't you have one over here? Hey what the fuck?
[4321.54s -> 4328.15s]  Got destroyed and I can't place anymore. Here have a have a heal. I put the heal. What do you mean a heal?
[4329.11s -> 4334.78s]  I put the heal drone thing down. There's green. Why do you why do you why have you know you've
[4334.78s -> 4338.70s]  been using that since the very beginning? That's a great one. I was using artillery
[4339.42s -> 4343.82s]  and it's more fun. I don't want to be the fucking support for you. Interesting you picked a class
[4343.82s -> 4350.46s]  called air support. Yeah and I have nothing that comes from the air. Also it's called air raider.
[4350.86s -> 4360.92s]  Whoa raid my health bar. Whoa that's what you should be doing not raiding the ground.
[4361.96s -> 4375.06s]  All right I don't know how I get more barriers. This is my chance to get some stuff. I might have
[4375.06s -> 4386.14s]  to pick up like a weapon box to get more I don't know. It doesn't oh I do press reload on it and
[4386.14s -> 4394.06s]  then they'll go away. Well I'm not gonna have them for a while. Oh no you're not? Okay well
[4394.06s -> 4401.50s]  then this strategy yeah what's your cooldown on the on the deflection? It's like 20 percent
[4401.50s -> 4405.10s]  reloaded. Here comes the big wave I think. I still have more health I can put down. Yeah I
[4405.10s -> 4409.42s]  think this is the big one. It's incoming in a second. How?
[4410.06s -> 4416.76s]  All right here it is. I hope you guys are prepared. I'm blocking this guy on the left.
[4417.90s -> 4429.03s]  Oh my lord. All right here it comes. I'm so scared. Don't worry this is easy. This is the easier
[4429.03s -> 4433.19s]  mission because there's so many you can't miss. Did you switch the difficulty for the
[4434.15s -> 4444.95s]  oh shit and we have we have the healing station still up. Powerful countries attacking us Jerma.
[4446.90s -> 4456.36s]  Ow. Keep it up. It's almost I almost have barriers. Good because we're gonna need them.
[4457.48s -> 4465.54s]  Oh god. It's pretty good for my shotgun because they're right on top of us. I don't know if I'm
[4465.54s -> 4472.65s]  hurting myself or they're hurting me. Oh no I got some down. I got some down. Awful.
[4478.04s -> 4483.64s]  You guys aren't even using them. Get behind my shield. I see it. Get behind my shield. Move
[4483.64s -> 4489.16s]  with the grace of someone wearing perpetual ice skates. I do best Reinhardt impression. Go
[4489.16s -> 4498.55s]  italics now. No. Stir. Overwatch sucks. I can't. What are we doing? Why are we?
[4499.67s -> 4502.31s]  It's trying to show us the new thing but we're all dying.
[4502.71s -> 4504.87s]  All right I'll go.
[4509.99s -> 4517.72s]  That could have been like a lot of characters.
[4520.42s -> 4523.78s]  The silence is what's getting me right now. All right I gotta get that. I'm focused.
[4527.83s -> 4533.40s]  Retreat. That means we did it. We did it. I can't. It's too green.
[4536.68s -> 4540.55s]  Why is there a nuke? The building's gone.
[4541.43s -> 4546.71s]  What? The building's gone. Our only source of cover just vanished. Hey there's no doubt they're
[4546.71s -> 4559.96s]  aliens guys. Any green crates today? I'm trying to get the fucking crates. You guys are laughing
[4559.96s -> 4567.62s]  having a laugh at about it a little bit over here. I'm trying to collect boxes. I don't think it's
[4567.62s -> 4575.46s]  over. No it just got way harder. We gotta find a new building. Yeah we gotta change position here.
[4576.79s -> 4583.93s]  You're dead? Yeah. Oh boy. Hold on. I'm coming. I was boosting as fast as I could to keep up.
[4584.65s -> 4603.18s]  Does that take health from me? I think it does. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. If I put my back to another
[4603.18s -> 4609.77s]  building I have more bunkers. I'm almost dead again. I got you if you do. Trying to just stay
[4609.77s -> 4625.45s]  close. Hostile forces. No way. I can't believe they're trying to kill us. Do you have a heal?
[4626.25s -> 4630.09s]  I don't. I can't do any more heals. There's a couple boxes. That would be very convenient.
[4630.73s -> 4639.61s]  Where are they? Like on the road there's some. Heals? Yeah there's a couple here. Well
[4641.21s -> 4644.57s]  if I could move faster than five miles an hour I would love to get. That's the worst part about
[4644.57s -> 4649.54s]  the character you're playing. Holy shit that takes half my health. Yeah you have to split
[4649.54s -> 4653.38s]  your health with me so I'm just a liability right now. Oh look at this. Find some cover.
[4653.38s -> 4656.34s]  Look at how many are here. We need to find a way out of here.
[4658.23s -> 4668.46s]  Holy shit. I'm stuck on a rock. Star any right ideas? I'm trying to get to a shield.
[4669.34s -> 4680.89s]  He's got super shield over here. Oh help. My health. Oh shield's already down. I don't know dude.
[4684.17s -> 4690.33s]  Yeah there's health right next to me actually. I'm down. It's just germabot. Yeah there's a health
[4690.33s -> 4703.96s]  box right next to me and there's a health box in front of star. Oh okay. All right just don't
[4703.96s -> 4712.70s]  pick me up. Your health is better spent like right now shooting things. Holy fuck. Are we
[4712.70s -> 4719.75s]  getting reinforcement? They're talking about reinforcing us? I don't even know what to shoot
[4719.75s -> 4732.47s]  at. There's so many. Oh boy this is where I die. This is where it's all gone. Holy shit. I'm dead.
[4734.62s -> 4738.22s]  I didn't actually mean to say thank you. My headphone hit it. It's just you man.
[4739.02s -> 4747.18s]  Well this is easy. I have no way I lose this. Ah there's a health crate. I'm in. I walk inside of a
[4747.18s -> 4758.30s]  ship. I think we hit the gear. I think we hit the gear check mission. We did get at least some more
[4758.30s -> 4767.11s]  armor. We did it. BMing. No I accidentally touched. Because we're still like finding loot and stuff
[4767.19s -> 4771.75s]  right. So you just get a portion of the shields that are better to shield cancel for movement
[4771.75s -> 4777.11s]  than others. I mean you can always go back and we can do another one and get better. I like still
[4777.11s -> 4786.17s]  don't have a vehicle. Dragon Lance. Interesting. Single shot great damage however it requires
[4786.17s -> 4794.41s]  several times the energy of a standard power lance. Longer charge time. Okay might be worth
[4794.41s -> 4829.05s]  using. Bolt gun. Okay let's see. What did we get? This one. I should probably mute. Everyone else
[4829.05s -> 4832.89s]  is muted. All right. Bolt gun. What to do. New type of gun that fires multiple electric bolts. I want a vehicle.
[4839.62s -> 4851.91s]  Bolt gun and then dragon lance. Um maybe we should try the dragon lance. High output. Look at that
[4851.91s -> 4866.10s]  thing. It's like a drill. Try it. All right. I'm ready. Are we doing an older mission? What are we
[4866.10s -> 4872.02s]  doing? We should probably just let's go back to the last mission. And so. Can you do the last mission on heart?
[4872.02s -> 4879.50s]  That they fixed my dash cancel and it doesn't work anymore. I heard people saying that earlier.
[4879.50s -> 4887.11s]  Um we can do that mission on easy and then just keep playing. On easy? But don't we want to do
[4887.11s -> 4890.87s]  you want to do it on easy? Do you want to go back and do one of the missions on heart? I kind of
[4890.87s -> 4897.99s]  just want to progress. Also yeah I mean usually before you could do like the first mission on
[4897.99s -> 4904.60s]  heart and get higher level stuff. I think that that's still the case isn't it? Probably. Want to
[4904.60s -> 4909.64s]  try that? You want to go back a mission and just do it on heart? But usually I think like in normal
[4909.64s -> 4915.72s]  in normal difficulty there's a there's a weapon level cap of like you can't use high level
[4915.72s -> 4920.12s]  shit in normal. Yeah it might be. But some sometimes here we're gonna we're gonna do it.
[4921.94s -> 4929.99s]  We're gonna we're gonna do it. Hey naked face game. This is the uh all the little bugs are
[4929.99s -> 4950.30s]  gonna rush us. So I'm gonna change my shit. So how the heck are you? Me I'm good. I'm ready.
[4950.30s -> 4960.10s]  Waiting for italics. So this is the last mission on heart. No this is one of the first missions on
[4960.10s -> 4965.22s]  heart. Please don't tell me this is the corridor mission. No not that one the one after that one
[4965.22s -> 4969.06s]  because the corridor mission is stupid. So well what kind of support equipment do we eventually get?
[4969.78s -> 4977.02s]  I have like two empty support slots for example. Um I don't for fence fence or I don't know. Yeah
[4977.02s -> 4987.30s]  I don't remember them having support. All right let's try the bolt gun. Oh okay. Oh you're hurting
[4987.30s -> 4993.46s]  me. I am. Oh it's this guy. EDF teaches you pretty early on to go back and farm now that repeated
[4993.46s -> 4998.50s]  weapons get upgraded. So I guess if you find the same weapon again it upgrades. That's cool.
[5000.41s -> 5007.03s]  All right so uh I guess two auto cannons is better than one. Oh this this thing is actually
[5007.03s -> 5016.20s]  really great. It's a great single target weapon. Dragonlance was a good choice. Whoever suggested
[5016.20s -> 5023.43s]  it thanks for the suggestion. It doesn't go that far though. It's still in normal? What?
[5024.07s -> 5028.57s]  Did you not change it? I definitely set it to hard. Did you confirm it? I don't know how you
[5028.57s -> 5041.80s]  could tell that it's still in normal. I'm not seeing very many crates. It's so slow. These are
[5041.80s -> 5054.06s]  so heavy. Wait what? It says there's one right here but there's not. Oh boy. Well I'm just getting
[5054.06s -> 5063.98s]  the armor. All right well there's a weapon crate. Well this definitely doesn't feel harder.
[5072.44s -> 5082.89s]  Does this go through everybody? I think it only goes into one person. Yeah it does.
[5087.10s -> 5089.18s]  It does but I am collecting.
[5096.04s -> 5102.92s]  This thing. I'd rather just use the other lightning gun. Wait why are our combat suits
[5102.92s -> 5109.40s]  acid resistant? I wonder if we ever had to deal with acid things before. Listen acid. It's in the lore.
[5111.32s -> 5114.60s]  I don't think so. Wait they're not. What? How do they not.
[5114.60s -> 5128.87s]  There's a weapon over here. It's so hard to aim. You don't see it anywhere to buy? Yeah for some
[5128.87s -> 5132.31s]  weird reason. This game is not featured anywhere on the PlayStation Store. You have to go looking.
[5132.31s -> 5139.22s]  No you have to like look for it. You can like purposefully search it. Oh god in 2018 you have
[5139.22s -> 5143.94s]  to search for your game. Well I mean you actually have to go into like all games. Actually though
[5143.94s -> 5147.78s]  if you go to the Epic game store then there's no search bar so I think they're figuring it out.
[5147.78s -> 5154.34s]  That's 2018. You shouldn't have to search for games anymore. What's with what's with this?
[5155.94s -> 5161.93s]  I don't want to talk about stores. I want to talk about monsters to shoot with our monster guns.
[5167.48s -> 5173.19s]  All right basically no one buy this game. That guy just come on comments and say it's okay if
[5173.19s -> 5180.74s]  you're a civilian. What? All right I'm searching. I'm searching. Scanning the area. I'm scanning. I
[5180.74s -> 5194.50s]  see one red box. I can't wait to get a good view of this. Look at this one. Nice dude. I want to
[5194.50s -> 5199.06s]  see a I want to see a mock-up of like who got the most kills. A mock-up. You don't want to see that.
[5199.94s -> 5206.58s]  You'd be very disappointed because it's not you think it's you it's the destiny not me.
[5206.58s -> 5212.87s]  It's going to be a talent. What? What are you talking about? Oh dude I'm gonna mock up. We're
[5212.87s -> 5217.19s]  talking about the Epic game store and how. Excuse me I thought we were not talking about game stores.
[5218.15s -> 5223.43s]  Yeah you just said that. Yeah you did just say that. Well we're talking about Epic games.
[5224.63s -> 5229.82s]  You guys know that I installed Fortnite yesterday and opened it to the menu. Doesn't it make you
[5229.82s -> 5235.98s]  install Fortnite? I did. Why? Because every time I died in Hotline Miami I was going to play around
[5235.98s -> 5245.18s]  to Fortnite. Oh. And then I kept getting very I died like 335 times. That's a lot of Fortnite games.
[5245.18s -> 5250.62s]  Yeah that was a lot. It was a lot. The stream was like 65 days long. Oh you're the W. God I
[5250.62s -> 5256.22s]  thought the W was weapon. Hang on. Fortnite and W is in the same sentence? Excuse me. What? What
[5256.22s -> 5263.34s]  stream am I on? What are you talking about? On the map for me you're a W. W. You are a W.
[5264.30s -> 5271.58s]  Star is an A. Oh yes. I'm not even on the map. No you're an F. F. That's that's accurate. So he's
[5271.58s -> 5281.50s]  the A for A student. F for F student and then W for weirdo. Can you please not? You said today
[5281.50s -> 5286.22s]  you were going to be good. I did say that. I did say I was going to be like good today. What is good?
[5286.22s -> 5289.66s]  No I didn't. I didn't fucking say that. I'm not even going to perpetuate that bullshit. I didn't
[5289.66s -> 5302.68s]  say anything. You just lied twice. Don't you know that 85% of everything I ever say on stream is not
[5302.68s -> 5309.08s]  true. We've already talked about this. Is that true? I don't know. Is that in the 15%? I don't
[5309.08s -> 5319.18s]  know. You have to figure that out. So is this part of the ask me anything? Could be. It is now.
[5319.74s -> 5328.12s]  No I'm not going to go peek at Alex's mic. So how much truth are you doing right now? Is that a lie
[5328.12s -> 5336.92s]  too? You need to watch Interstellar. Hey don't spoil that movie. I haven't seen it. I'm going
[5336.92s -> 5345.53s]  to change your parameters. Holy shit there's so many things over there. Get it. Got it.
[5348.71s -> 5352.95s]  Okay there we go. Now that's what I'm talking about. Mad weapons. Mad weapons.
[5353.75s -> 5366.15s]  Yeah I got a bunch of the same shit. Mirage zero. Homing weapon. Leveled up. All right that's pretty
[5366.15s -> 5376.22s]  good. Turbo core. Level up. Yeah you have to click apply settings when you change the difficulty.
[5379.37s -> 5382.01s]  Spark mine level up. Energy cost is down. That's good.
[5382.01s -> 5387.05s]  Why? More capacity. Lot more capacity for the machine gun. So do you want to try and do that
[5387.05s -> 5394.66s]  on hard or no? We could. Okay I'm putting on hard and I'm applying the setting. Also this means
[5394.66s -> 5406.76s]  there's friendly fire now. Okay which mission is this? Sorry. It's the same one we just did.
[5406.76s -> 5424.47s]  Okay so interesting. All land based. Grenade. Bolt gun I'm not a fan of. Maybe when it's upgraded
[5424.47s -> 5434.84s]  it's better. Oh I feel like this would be not. Looks like we're waiting on a couple other people
[5434.84s -> 5441.67s]  to ready up right now. Yeah but hold on. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah I'm gonna
[5441.67s -> 5447.24s]  kill you guys. What? What the fuck are you talking about? All three of my equipment are artillery.
[5447.24s -> 5455.46s]  Oh fuck. Do I get like a friendly fire on in hard? It shows you and then you can move. Okay
[5455.54s -> 5460.60s]  That was just that was really that was a weird way to start that. I'm gonna go kill you guys.
[5462.60s -> 5475.06s]  I'm gonna kill you guys. Stop. Stop this. I'm the one that's supposed to be good today. What?
[5475.06s -> 5478.90s]  What does it have to do with anything? You get you both are talking about killing me.
[5480.66s -> 5486.06s]  Yeah well you haven't been very good. There's only one of us that would actually do that though.
[5488.28s -> 5498.60s]  Whoa. And it's not me. But I you know I don't have motive but I do have opportunity.
[5499.40s -> 5504.12s]  Oh I accidentally did the other one. What do you mean the accident? What'd you accidentally do?
[5504.12s -> 5510.28s]  I had moved the mission forward and I didn't I didn't approve of it. Why are you doing these
[5510.28s -> 5521.42s]  schools? Are we restarting? No. I wish I could shoot my Gatling at the same time as the mortar.
[5522.62s -> 5525.74s]  Because I should be able to destroy these pretty easily with the shit I have.
[5527.85s -> 5539.64s]  Well yay. Actually I kind of don't mind. This is really this is really just brainless gun.
[5540.28s -> 5545.38s]  It just locks on and homings. It's a matter of class weapons.
[5549.24s -> 5557.91s]  So do weapon boxes actually appear on the minimap or do you just have to spot them?
[5557.91s -> 5562.87s]  They appear on the ground. That's I know they're on the ground. I'm asking if
[5562.87s -> 5568.71s]  okay well you think maybe the green dots are you were jokingly saying I'm going to kill you but
[5568.71s -> 5577.32s]  you did. I didn't mean to. You bet you did. And that did not last very long. So I wonder
[5577.32s -> 5584.79s]  is Star the one that's killing us? No I'm the one that's winning the mission. You have heals anymore?
[5586.23s -> 5595.82s]  No. Oh I guess I'll just die though. I just got I just landed on my neck.
[5595.98s -> 5598.22s]  I just got blown up by your extreme explosion.
[5598.86s -> 5603.42s]  All you gotta do is not stand next to the pylon. Hey all you gotta do is not lay it down on top
[5603.42s -> 5607.98s]  of our name tag which is visible across the entire map. I'm not. I keep throwing them on the pylon.
[5607.98s -> 5612.78s]  Fucking boober. All right pick me up. I'm picking up the weapon chest.
[5615.42s -> 5617.02s]  No I think we get shit even if we fail.
[5617.02s -> 5627.59s]  Don't die forehead. Just don't die forehead. Let me get full health and I'll come rescue you.
[5628.90s -> 5639.18s]  I can't damage these myself. I like only have artillery. I'm trying to get as many things as
[5639.18s -> 5645.40s]  I can. I think even if we die we get them because last time where when we failed that um
[5646.36s -> 5655.19s]  the air the ufo one we still got shit. I just need like a second. Boom. All right I'm just
[5655.19s -> 5660.33s]  gonna stay up here for a second and just take a look. Any more crates? I can get down over
[5660.33s -> 5667.69s]  the pylon. Just crates. I'm gonna try to get some. Singular ants can kill me. Yeah they do a lot of
[5667.69s -> 5676.94s]  damage because it's hard. Okay I don't have a cool guy dodge roll. I have just I jump one time. Be
[5676.94s -> 5694.41s]  aware of that happening. Oh my god. Okay are you doing it again? No okay. Jeez Louise man. If you
[5694.41s -> 5701.21s]  want me to I can. All right I'm dying over here. I'm coming back there now. I had to pick up stuff
[5701.21s -> 5706.33s]  with the pylon. Oh what? Walking dead episode. What the fuck are you doing? What? You just panicked
[5706.33s -> 5714.98s]  me. You panicked me. You maybe pressed my button and I fucking hurt myself. I meant to cancel the
[5714.98s -> 5730.47s]  throw but it doesn't. It didn't. Stop calling me a civilian. All right are we okay? No. No there's a
[5730.47s -> 5737.05s]  bunch of ants coming at me. Well do something about it. I don't have any guns. I'm a civilian.
[5738.01s -> 5748.98s]  Yeah are you actually? Oh baby. You just laser yourself. Yeah. I'm just gonna hide in this bush.
[5751.16s -> 5760.65s]  I'm almost out of power. I'm out of power. I need more power. Can you kill like one thing?
[5760.65s -> 5764.01s]  You don't understand. It's very hard for me to do what I'm doing right now.
[5765.58s -> 5769.82s]  I have to wait. If you kill one thing I get more bombs. I mean yes I did. I killed five
[5770.70s -> 5778.47s]  okay and now it's gonna kill me. No don't. Oh I see. That's why I can't dash or jump because
[5778.47s -> 5785.34s]  those are my support items I have yet to unlock. I'm just gonna break my fucking controller in my
[5785.34s -> 5797.03s]  bare hands. Do we get any items? We did. All right look at these though. That's a level two
[5797.67s -> 5808.84s]  pulse machine gun R. Yeah I didn't really get anything good for me. Same shit. Look at that.
[5811.46s -> 5826.62s]  Smaller range but better. Pulse machine gun R. R for really good. The big cannon is kind of hard
[5826.62s -> 5837.96s]  to use. Yeah look at this. This is a huge increase. Nine damage to twelve faster rate of fire. Okay
[5837.96s -> 5850.06s]  we're doing the not pile on one on hard. I feel like I'd rather just use the let me see what this
[5850.06s -> 5863.38s]  thing does. I think I'm just yeah I'm just gonna keep shields on permanently. I'll go back to the
[5863.38s -> 5877.02s]  shotgun. Yeah shotgun seems pretty decent here actually. I also have one. Jerma should play
[5877.02s -> 5892.14s]  Dante must die. DMC. Oh did you hear the drama about the new devil may cry? No I did not. What
[5892.14s -> 5899.16s]  drama? I don't think there is any. Well let's make some. Wait hold on you you're just making that up.
[5900.90s -> 5905.62s]  Well there's this really weird intro sequence like scene where he just starts like slapping
[5905.62s -> 5914.82s]  women and saying like really sexist things. What's wrong with your brain? What's wrong with Dante?
[5916.02s -> 5930.52s]  That's a great question. I hope that team ninja answers for this. All right here we go.
[5936.14s -> 5945.72s]  All right grit shot. I can hear that. Let me see if I can hear again. I could I could hear that.
[5945.72s -> 5952.44s]  Like they say only people under a certain age can hear that noise. Only dogs. Dogs are if you're
[5952.44s -> 5958.66s]  young enough you can hear that. Dogs. All right I'm gonna do something tell me if your dog does
[5958.66s -> 5967.94s]  anything. I'm gonna put that as my ringtone during class. I'm gonna try and not kill you.
[5968.50s -> 5976.46s]  Please don't. That is what set me down the death spiral last time. This thing's actually pretty
[5976.46s -> 5989.22s]  effective. Look at the boxes. Fobos. Fobos. What? There's a bunch of weapon crates over here.
[5989.94s -> 5993.38s]  I'm going around collecting them. Okay I'm bombing these guys.
[5996.04s -> 5998.20s]  All right I'm staying near you because I don't think you'll bomb yourself.
[5999.00s -> 6007.03s]  I mean he would. He already did it. He did already do that. Did he bomb himself? Oh yeah.
[6008.07s -> 6014.31s]  Yes he did last mission. No it shows you. I actually I did last mission. Yes he did. That
[6014.31s -> 6033.05s]  was an accident. So it happened at least once. Hold on I see a weapon. All right collecting.
[6034.39s -> 6041.93s]  Two weapons. No I want them. Okay can you guys kill these ants? Like these dinosaurs?
[6042.01s -> 6050.30s]  Oh yep yep yep yep yep. I'll try. I'm calling you. Oh god that poor guy.
[6051.66s -> 6058.14s]  Shit I'm right. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Oh my god this is not what I'm aiming at.
[6058.94s -> 6067.24s]  Oh you're dead dead. Watch out I'm bombing you. Maybe actually good. Maybe that'll knock me over
[6067.24s -> 6074.42s]  to near a tower. You're just stealing all the guns. It's sharing. I am putting myself. See it
[6074.42s -> 6081.02s]  helped. I'm putting myself in harm's way to get all the items. I'm coming. And then I get bonked.
[6081.91s -> 6092.28s]  Oh I almost shot you. I may have shot you. All right I'm here. Someone just said I'm good.
[6092.28s -> 6102.20s]  I want you guys to know that. I mean you are but you you are good but like yeah only only at very
[6102.20s -> 6113.22s]  specific things. Like what? Table tennis. You were good at table tennis. You are? That's about it.
[6116.92s -> 6139.13s]  I heard that. I heard that. Okay easy. Anything over there? Yeah they survived through my earth
[6139.13s -> 6153.58s]  right. Oh boy. Oh jeez. Oh boy. Oh jeez. There are too many enemies. I would agree.
[6166.49s -> 6182.10s]  I gotta stay in the air. I'm also trying to stay in the air. I got another. Okay it's time to do
[6182.10s -> 6196.70s]  or die. Are you bombing yourself? Yes. That's a sun suit tactic. God damn it. God. Danger close.
[6197.50s -> 6205.42s]  I'm coming. This is danger close. I feel like this game's harder than last game. Personally.
[6206.14s -> 6214.49s]  Oh my god. I got you. Get up. Because we need. We need you. I'm dead. I distracted a bunch of
[6214.49s -> 6219.59s]  them though. Now they're all coming for you. Sweet. Hold on. I can still get stuff.
[6221.59s -> 6234.20s]  Yeah just pick stuff up. They're all coming over here. All right. Just pick up as much as you can
[6234.20s -> 6240.34s]  then die. I have an idea though. What if I bring them all over here? And then we're going to go
[6240.34s -> 6253.16s]  for it. Here we go. Ready. Hold on. We're ready. Oh this is not going to take long to just die
[6253.16s -> 6263.53s]  again. Yep. Welcome back. Red wizard. And then don't worry about me for a second. Welcome back.
[6266.73s -> 6273.53s]  Is playing a man down change the spawn or no? Like are we playing a four player tuned? Yeah
[6273.53s -> 6278.74s]  we're playing a man down and nothing changes because of that. Oh yeah I guess that helps
[6278.74s -> 6284.31s]  explain. Any more items? It's like seeing a monster hunt a world without the cats.
[6287.58s -> 6300.33s]  I see that explosion about to happen. Is that done? Is the explosion over? Yeah you'll see
[6300.33s -> 6309.67s]  the red on the ground. I'm sorry. Oh my god. I mean if you just fly forever you should be able
[6309.67s -> 6315.80s]  to kill them eventually. That's true. This is the last wave I have. Yeah this does seem like the
[6315.80s -> 6321.64s]  final wave. You just have to get good. I'm handling things don't worry. Do you want to
[6321.64s -> 6325.72s]  resurrect anybody? Just so you have to stay good. Oh they're up on the building.
[6328.42s -> 6343.67s]  I can still like see the vomit of projectiles. God damn it. Stop singing. You're covering my
[6343.67s -> 6352.26s]  screen with like fucking notifications. You've got like annotations all over my screen and it's
[6352.26s -> 6367.29s]  fucking me up. There's cheese puffs following you. God. Yeah. You got this. I need to wait. I need
[6367.29s -> 6379.21s]  to get. Look just don't get hit. Oh no what did I do? Mistake. Mistake. Mistake. Mistake. Mistake.
[6381.03s -> 6389.03s]  Mistake. Oh I like playing this game with the soundboard enabled by default. You just jump by
[6389.03s -> 6394.36s]  me. Look how much health you got. How many times did I say help me? And you just go right by me.
[6394.36s -> 6398.60s]  Yeah don't res me. Res him. He can call down an airstrike. Do you want to be resurrected?
[6399.16s -> 6403.00s]  I thought I was supposed to just run away and kill them. There was no reason not to get me
[6403.00s -> 6413.62s]  up. Okay well then fucking there we go. One two three. I panicked. Hold on. Let's count to three
[6413.62s -> 6447.14s]  again. One. Listen help me too. Two. Three. Do it. Help me. Oh nice airstrike. Look at all those
[6447.14s -> 6455.59s]  ants get demolished. How many more people are left? Dude I am the GPS. I can get you. I can get you.
[6456.47s -> 6470.39s]  All right. Where the fuck are you? Oh you're. Oh I'm over here. Hey what's up? Oh I'm down again.
[6470.39s -> 6473.19s]  But there's like there's not very much. I'll be down again in about two seconds as well.
[6473.91s -> 6479.83s]  There's only like six. There's seven. There's seven. Don't put pressure on me. Save this like
[6479.83s -> 6490.97s]  a hundred. There's a hundred. You have to res me. Okay I'll get you. No fuck this. Let me prove
[6490.97s -> 6511.74s]  that I'm capable. Quiet. That's no noise. Oh my god I'm losing my mind. You can just do it.
[6511.74s -> 6520.74s]  Just get over here. Both of you. I don't even care. Wow that was that was like an anime
[6520.74s -> 6531.46s]  resurrection. You just whizzed by me. It was crazy. All right well I have a shotgun and a mortar so.
[6532.26s -> 6534.89s]  All right I'm coming. I think you did it. Oh no.
[6534.89s -> 6536.89s]  No.
[6540.33s -> 6547.29s]  There's another wave. Oh god. No. There's it's the double wave. It's like the super wave. I'm
[6547.29s -> 6558.87s]  going. I'm running away. I'm going on a building. Oh no. I'm making my last stand. Oh my god.
[6559.75s -> 6573.72s]  What the fuck have I done? Well the mechs are online or whatever that's worth.
[6575.64s -> 6578.20s]  All right hold on. Hold on. This is this might not be terrible.
[6580.42s -> 6583.86s]  There is a health pack right next to me as well. Okay hold on. Oh my god. What.
[6584.50s -> 6596.46s]  I have the wrong thing. Health pack right next to you Tox. Yeah coming in. Honestly then I get my
[6597.10s -> 6601.74s]  artillery back when things die. So because there were more things I could just I just spammed them.
[6602.38s -> 6608.84s]  We did it. Oh fuck. I see a weapon. Get me. I can't get it. What the fuck.
[6609.64s -> 6618.33s]  Three weapons. Did I get it? Oh I almost pulled my whole monitor down. Level five items.
[6618.33s -> 6624.57s]  I got powered exoskeletons. We're good now. We did it. Atalix. High five Atalix. You did it.
[6625.29s -> 6630.79s]  You did it Atalix. Okay but now we have better stuff. Like you couldn't have won without me
[6630.79s -> 6638.25s]  distracting half the enemies for the two seconds it took me to die each time. You might consider
[6638.25s -> 6644.58s]  switching to ranger just because like fencers are so you need to like people are saying you get
[6644.58s -> 6649.06s]  you get movement things on your support options later well what did you just get because you
[6649.06s -> 6654.98s]  should have got some higher level stuff for um special i did get enhanced boosters add booster
[6654.98s -> 6668.68s]  one well it sounds good atalix that's a lot better better version of the post machine gun
[6668.68s -> 6676.79s]  are the thing we were just using better though if you do want to play ranger i can also summon
[6677.75s -> 6685.21s]  a exoskeleton you can try it now that kind of sounds fun top secret super weapon its very
[6685.21s -> 6701.77s]  existence is classified there's oh i think i want that oh that's better in the core that's called b
[6703.82s -> 6707.82s]  are we doing the aerial mission again or want to do another one on hard or something
[6708.78s -> 6718.18s]  you want to try the one we just did a bacon discharger discharges cooked bacon okay so same
[6718.18s -> 6726.55s]  mission did you say bacon launcher yeah can i get a confirmation same mission i'm trying to decide
[6726.55s -> 6732.79s]  if i want to switch classes yeah let's give him a second figure that out because i have one extra
[6732.79s -> 6737.59s]  booster is there really going to be like the difference maker in my whole class well what was
[6737.91s -> 6743.19s]  your the other stuff you've leveled up did you get better for that mission i only got like a
[6743.19s -> 6753.35s]  i got a level five shield and add one booster um yeah i don't know switch play ranger okay
[6754.89s -> 6760.66s]  i wonder what i should use right now well then yeah we can do the same mission i can summon you
[6760.66s -> 6774.22s]  the mech and you can play ranger lightning bow 100 per second things are better across the board
[6775.02s -> 6784.07s]  let's try the super weapon and then their upgraded lighting bill i wonder how cool this thing is
[6784.71s -> 6794.47s]  oh shit that does so much more damage i was like i don't want to use some dumb limpid gun but it's
[6794.47s -> 6806.97s]  like a level three and does so much more than everything else i'm ready yeah are you going to
[6806.97s -> 6813.13s]  try ranger it doesn't hurt just to try it for one mission yeah it really it's a lot of um
[6814.01s -> 6819.37s]  like projectile explosives rocket launchers grenades that type of stuff machine guns
[6820.57s -> 6828.98s]  as some of their weapons are okay but they're basic it's a very balanced basic class that has
[6828.98s -> 6834.66s]  good weapons you know the fencer is oh wow dash around you got your huge you have these big
[6834.66s -> 6841.70s]  arm cannons and lances you get to fly if you play the the wing diver the air raider vehicles and
[6841.70s -> 6854.98s]  big explosions rangers just i have weapons and i shoot them and i'm that's it all right let's
[6855.46s -> 6860.52s]  you can just ride my mech you can just do that the whole mission okay we'll give it a try because
[6860.52s -> 6866.28s]  it's a level five mech i'll be able to actually walk without um ice skating oh no this thing is
[6866.28s -> 6874.66s]  going to be slow as hell yeah you guys but you come on you got to put like whooshes in the middle
[6875.86s -> 6889.22s]  whoosh like that's if there's a storm there's gonna be rain lightning wait so i i let's see
[6889.22s -> 6896.86s]  how this thing works oh i can't summon the mech yet i think it's a long oh my god okay
[6898.14s -> 6912.22s]  how long does it last it lasts a long time this thing just shoots myconykes everywhere all right
[6913.93s -> 6927.43s]  okay i'm gonna get used to these new controls here this thing's pretty cool now you're good
[6928.15s -> 6942.23s]  you're good guys oh you're good that's like a insane person time for revenge time for revenge
[6943.51s -> 6955.02s]  this thing this thing is so inaccurate this thing is so this thing is so do i have to like not be
[6955.02s -> 6969.19s]  moving i can't zoom with it you just shred i think this thing shreds why am i using that term
[6969.19s -> 6974.79s]  civilian um civilian stir how do you choose between jumping and dodge rolling uh you have
[6974.79s -> 6981.59s]  to hold left to dodge usually okay so i'm holding l2 and sometimes it rolls and sometimes it jumps
[6981.59s -> 6990.41s]  yeah yeah it's rolling is left and right oh i see jumping is and weather i cast off these petty
[6990.41s -> 7001.13s]  illusions so where's that uh awesome mech i i have to kill enough things like we have to as a team
[7001.13s -> 7011.21s]  fill enough things before i can summon it it's about 75 percent oh no no no what are you doing
[7011.21s -> 7018.09s]  to me i don't even know you're doing this oh did you get bombed almost it takes a long time to
[7018.09s -> 7035.53s]  come in your time that's good initiation procedure get initiated watch out behind you're actually
[7035.53s -> 7044.20s]  like crazy glad you know yeah it's really good because their projectiles are so slow by comparison
[7044.20s -> 7051.38s]  get out of the dirt it's kind of like dark souls hey i play that you're playing it's like the the
[7051.38s -> 7063.88s]  souls of ants sim the souls of ants sim yeah what the hell does that mean there is like a sim
[7063.88s -> 7072.01s]  ant game right yeah i tried to play it yeah good games it's very old all right that's the it's
[7072.01s -> 7081.58s]  identifying characteristic it's old sim ant yeah i played that once it's old right through the front
[7081.58s -> 7091.22s]  door one two get it out there okay i'm i'm almost sort of kind of at the point where i could maybe
[7091.22s -> 7100.39s]  summon this thing that i wanted to have it looks like um does it matter if you burst fire or just
[7100.39s -> 7115.29s]  hold the button down uh for accuracy yeah for accuracy that's a good question oh i'm just
[7115.37s -> 7125.11s]  stinging get away from me okay i can summon the thing all right i guess i press circle
[7127.74s -> 7131.10s]  i'm going to take this opportunity to pick up this stuff that's a lot of health over here
[7131.98s -> 7141.61s]  just make sure if you need health you come over over this way i need that diffuser such a word
[7141.61s -> 7153.34s]  blown out it's terrifying i'm coming eat it i need it oh yeah yeah walk into it come on
[7154.30s -> 7156.70s]  i'm actually way better at killing things as a ranger
[7165.98s -> 7169.16s]  where the fuck is my thing
[7171.40s -> 7175.48s]  i try to keep them around this thing so they just die eventually and not summoning it
[7176.92s -> 7181.88s]  okay what i assumed it was the same button to revive people because it said that the
[7181.88s -> 7186.28s]  vehicle button oh i'm going towards the smoke stand ball for titanfall
[7187.93s -> 7194.17s]  stand fall i'll come back to you guys under it will i get smashed i think so
[7195.05s -> 7208.14s]  okay i kind of want to do it sure nope it didn't smash the bug there it is well go get it yes
[7208.14s -> 7211.98s]  all right let's see it powered up why do you have like silly spring on your hands
[7213.70s -> 7217.38s]  i think it has limited ammo so be aware of that what is it may i
[7217.46s -> 7224.98s]  my is it the same buttons to shoot i think it's so slow yeah they're really slow but as long as
[7224.98s -> 7235.19s]  you stay there anymore armor oh boy any more crates that i didn't see before there's a jump button
[7239.08s -> 7240.36s]  what does r1 l1 do
[7246.02s -> 7249.78s]  i don't even see my grenade game supposedly firing dude my game rate just went down so
[7249.78s -> 7257.38s]  my frame rate just went down so much my game rate my game rate just went down all right time
[7257.38s -> 7267.13s]  to collect how are you supposed to walk in a straight line like mech is drunk oh my god i
[7267.13s -> 7279.35s]  gave my mech to the fucking newbie to be fair this has two guns on it one is a grenade launcher
[7279.35s -> 7285.86s]  which all the grenades have a fuse and the second gun is like dragon ball z
[7287.62s -> 7291.62s]  start picking up boxes oh that's what i'm doing don't don't kill them all box time
[7293.00s -> 7297.72s]  that's what i'm doing for the last like two straight minutes if i pick up health in the mech
[7297.72s -> 7312.49s]  though i heal um maybe but yeah there's two separate control schemes here all right i got
[7312.49s -> 7324.65s]  buster nice nice nice nice nice nice nice nice oh i got different ones now and i got the armored
[7324.65s -> 7335.06s]  vehicle grape i'm just playing scout in man versus machine um in a sense dude i love the grape
[7336.34s -> 7349.99s]  the glep near the gleap near that's a level five special okay the destroyer blaster well looks or
[7349.99s -> 7357.35s]  the lightning bow m2 we got some toys to play with why can i hear myself every time sorry that
[7357.35s -> 7365.66s]  was that's me i could just hear myself every time you got very loud well you keep peeking your mic
[7365.66s -> 7375.82s]  no i don't power lance more range that's a lot more capacity oh boy i just found six new weapons
[7376.70s -> 7386.26s]  so many toys numerous beams over a wide area okay okay yeah yeah one raven okay uh salt rifle
[7387.62s -> 7400.36s]  is the m2 uh pump action shotgun all right damn plasma fault damn mirage zero damn the gleap near
[7400.92s -> 7413.56s]  discharges a ball of energy this is missiles that home and on nearby enemies um okay scout bomber
[7414.52s -> 7424.76s]  all right so would you like to go back and do the aerial mission i think we're ready i think we
[7424.76s -> 7435.53s]  might be ready so i think i agree um for the aerial i'm debating between taking a second assault
[7435.53s -> 7441.13s]  rifle or if we're gonna hide under the building again a shotgun are we gonna do the like hide
[7441.13s -> 7446.17s]  under building thing i want to try my new toys i don't know i think we might be strong enough
[7446.17s -> 7451.45s]  to not have to hide but who knows i'm gonna take the i'm gonna bring the healer with us again
[7454.46s -> 7469.80s]  destroy your blaster um i just need class people only one capacity though
[7473.45s -> 7479.70s]  that's just too big i'm gonna try with this the new lightning bro and then this crazy weapon i have
[7479.70s -> 7486.94s]  a heal now i think heal subordinate soldiers i'm gonna try the new weapons you hear that
[7486.94s -> 7495.24s]  subordinate can you put on actual armor uh no armor just health and you pick up those little
[7495.24s -> 7502.10s]  red boxes to permanently increase it that's the only way oh wait yeah i had i had the grape
[7503.53s -> 7511.98s]  is that just uh transportation what do you what do you say about grapes i have the grape what's
[7511.98s -> 7520.62s]  the grape oh no it has a howitzer on it and it carries four people do you have to be a ranger
[7520.62s -> 7533.24s]  to get in yeah oh i think so anyway oh sorry the heels only for me listen i'm on a new character
[7533.24s -> 7540.58s]  class and there's a gun called anti-aircraft impulse that i guess i'm gonna try you're eating
[7540.58s -> 7548.18s]  like gum in in your mic like unwrapping it in your mic in yeah i'm unwrapping it inside the mic
[7548.82s -> 7555.35s]  are you marked as a oh god we have this on hard why did you do this to us accident also i didn't
[7555.35s -> 7564.34s]  even select the mission did i oh non-rangers can be passengers in the grape cool no i mean
[7564.34s -> 7572.07s]  you protein bar i mean these little snack replacement bars all right what if the prince
[7572.07s -> 7577.51s]  was a it's the wrong mission anyway i have to change it i don't have the shit for this
[7578.39s -> 7587.10s]  oh i thought we were doing the air control mission we are i just i'm a bad host and all
[7587.10s -> 7596.90s]  complaints directed at me look at all those items we got get on it man come on that's when we ready
[7598.44s -> 7609.38s]  hey get on it it'd be great if like the telling me that germa has selected an item isn't covering
[7609.38s -> 7614.42s]  up the options like what i can't ready because apparently i'm not allowed to oh no i can't use
[7614.42s -> 7621.70s]  this i can't use these two things ship it's the same problem as last time yeah you could use oh
[7621.70s -> 7625.54s]  yeah you could use them on the other mission because that was hard oh like you can yeah i
[7625.54s -> 7637.98s]  have to lower my level looks like up to level three is all you can use hmm okay still ready
[7637.98s -> 7645.18s]  i'm gonna try plasma fall fuck it you know what i mean um i have a destroyer blaster who cares
[7647.02s -> 7657.77s]  it's really chewy chewy i hope that plasma fall is good at shooting uh airborne dart
[7657.77s -> 7664.25s]  i hope it is too i don't think it is i remember that weapon really chewy though so that's where
[7664.25s -> 7668.09s]  that's one yeah it's pretty chewy that's one good thing can you open another into your microphone
[7668.09s -> 7676.14s]  god are you beating i saw all of them by the way i'm testing the new weapon i have never used it
[7677.10s -> 7685.30s]  i saw 100% hey jerma do you need jerma to come back do you need any gatorade ah jerma you need
[7685.30s -> 7691.86s]  gatorade no no we just won the championship no what's happening don't dump it on me oh what
[7691.86s -> 7702.79s]  good joke this thing what the fuck look at the range on this thing wow plasma plasma falls like
[7702.79s -> 7714.25s]  you fly up into the air and mortar down on people who made that i thought this thing would be
[7714.89s -> 7725.27s]  doing more damage so what does this thing do i got a little blinky red boy yeah this thing sucks
[7725.27s -> 7733.06s]  for this god we are we're in bad how long does this stay put all right yeah that thing's not good
[7733.06s -> 7740.09s]  oh does it only shoot one enemy i'm i am holding it that's as far as it goes that's a single
[7740.09s -> 7749.58s]  aircraft claymore yeah this is not good let's kill nine aircraft plasma destroy is not bad
[7749.58s -> 7762.07s]  it's got a good range and it doesn't take my uh jet pack yeah so i have nine of these why wouldn't
[7762.07s -> 7767.21s]  i bring with the homing things that i have i want to try the new weapon worth a try see if there
[7767.21s -> 7772.23s]  were they had a homing thing as well but it's only a single shot this thing this thing's good
[7773.26s -> 7781.82s]  this thing sucks oh fuck i forgot it's using my am i wall that's that's a surprise that's a surprise
[7781.82s -> 7797.02s]  egg it's you it's white no one will ever know all right i understand yeah i'm like useless right
[7797.02s -> 7814.44s]  now this does have decent range oh you can reload these i'm dead there's a giant health pack next to
[7814.44s -> 7826.87s]  me though there's a large we'll we'll spread out coming don't pick up the health before no i have
[7826.87s -> 7832.23s]  to because otherwise i'd be at like two health isn't it group heal oh whoops i've no i tried
[7832.23s -> 7843.05s]  to swim no group kill the yellow reduces damage you take oh well i'm just gonna only use these
[7843.05s -> 7854.79s]  impulse grenades from now on i can't even just i can't do anything this gun is super bad just
[7854.79s -> 7864.66s]  germa's character screaming in pain it was supposed to be better it was a higher level
[7865.38s -> 7872.94s]  is my thing actually doing anything i'm just gonna go get weapons
[7878.04s -> 7883.29s]  i don't think we've got this one in the bag as they say i mean there's so many people here i get
[7883.29s -> 7897.32s]  to summon the uh stop reloading they live here okay i feel you well okay no substantial information
[7897.32s -> 7902.44s]  about the flying object the other weapon i have is really not great at all there you go i didn't
[7902.44s -> 7905.40s]  reload now i'm fully protected against all ufos right here
[7916.66s -> 7923.48s]  oh come on destroyer somehow this is working well this defense thing seems really good
[7923.48s -> 7928.36s]  we're barely we have double defense because i'm putting down nine separate anti-airs like
[7928.36s -> 7936.95s]  shotguns that's the red flashes all right here comes more all right time to reload
[7941.62s -> 7948.58s]  oh humans anymore if they were attacking any other mammal we would not be so concerned
[7950.70s -> 7957.90s]  basically i love that series what series any other mammal no he's talking about your
[7957.90s -> 7968.70s]  basically series oh so he's being a sarcastic cunt whoa whoa my god what the fuck it's a reload
[7968.70s -> 7983.94s]  i was just in shock all right here we go uh are you in the mech yeah cool oh my god i think but
[7983.94s -> 7993.59s]  it's dealing a lot of damage also i'm almost dead easy easy there what people say that in
[7993.59s -> 8009.35s]  england like it's the word serial you're fine demonetize yeah this thing shreds that guy's
[8009.35s -> 8017.59s]  already dead all right here it comes that weapon crate but i guess i'll just look up we have to
[8017.59s -> 8021.59s]  move from here and die we gotta move from here oh my god they're destroying everything here
[8022.47s -> 8027.50s]  it's okay i have a dodge roll his eye frame get me in that little zone
[8029.50s -> 8042.57s]  it's still this is actually working i really can't believe you said that on stream star
[8043.21s -> 8053.13s]  what like you said serial on stream why are you gonna be so tight you can't say cereal
[8054.89s -> 8061.69s]  oh that that green i'm shooting at us what happened to me why does that happen to me
[8061.69s -> 8074.34s]  that shot a super giant green laser i love that line i gotta get to this heal there's what there's
[8074.34s -> 8081.27s]  a healed station down still where's it in the green where i am oh no it's gone it disappeared
[8081.27s -> 8088.12s]  right as i got shoot i'm almost reloaded my guard post though which is the defense this is a pretty
[8088.12s -> 8098.79s]  good little weapon here for this mission oh my god okay here comes a shit load where are we off
[8098.79s -> 8105.45s]  to and people said this class was boring all right you got it down good i don't think they had anti-air
[8105.45s -> 8115.38s]  beacons before i gotta get this health let me try and drop something here
[8121.59s -> 8125.19s]  so much going on this actually might work
[8134.14s -> 8149.29s]  found the heel the gigantic ship god damn it what happened they're all relatively quite large
[8150.01s -> 8169.21s]  i oh my goodness this is what it would like to play far cry five this is what it feels like to
[8169.21s -> 8185.48s]  choose right dump sponsored all right i'm gonna start collecting audio back is it really gonna
[8185.48s -> 8194.90s]  take this many shots to kill you what the heck was that there's no crates really anywhere i'm
[8194.90s -> 8207.27s]  gonna fly over me i dare you okay seriously this thing is a machine gun that like one shot sees
[8215.61s -> 8223.61s]  what is it yellow force field uh like our just our health up like she like we resist damage better
[8223.61s -> 8231.50s]  yeah yeah there's this damage quite a bit which is i think a big reason why we weren't dying
[8231.50s -> 8244.73s]  all right let's see a couple over here did we beat it i don't know it seems kind of quiet seems very
[8244.73s -> 8257.64s]  quiet you see any crates into teams of hundreds i don't see any great danger now there's two down
[8257.64s -> 8262.52s]  here he's all right we're gonna play laser tech uh there's still something coming this way
[8264.30s -> 8269.74s]  let's just race ships over there i just thought you might want a disco party what is over here
[8269.74s -> 8274.22s]  since you've got these big red uh flares coming out of your gun these things are remaining
[8274.22s -> 8280.36s]  these things are stuck in the building i would have so many points right now
[8281.16s -> 8287.18s]  it's gonna stuck in the building you're not allowed to look at me he's desperately trying
[8287.18s -> 8292.86s]  to get over here look i'm gonna protect you i'm gonna make sure not a single alien ship
[8292.86s -> 8296.70s]  gets in i should uh i should reload my stuff just in case we're not done
[8298.38s -> 8303.51s]  i think we're good there you go stand in that circle you'll be safe forever
[8303.51s -> 8316.89s]  hey we finally beat that mission what do you know all right i got the suppressed gun
[8320.06s -> 8324.46s]  oh dude you try out this new silent gun suppressed gun we finally beat it
[8325.26s -> 8330.36s]  well what difficulty was that on that was uh that was normal that was the normal that we couldn't
[8330.36s -> 8339.37s]  take it before closed laser turbo car grit shot up okay what did it do though this mag blaster
[8340.65s -> 8343.85s]  so every time you get a level up it increases the star counter right
[8345.29s -> 8351.93s]  i yeah this doesn't go level up just because you got an up no it's just i think it's a randomized
[8351.93s -> 8357.77s]  chance to have like a better roll maybe depending on how what level it is oh i think if you just
[8357.77s -> 8362.57s]  look and don't immediately press x on every notification it tells you exactly what it
[8362.57s -> 8368.73s]  did yeah it shows you what like what yeah increase too but i just have to x fast because i don't have
[8368.73s -> 8374.97s]  time to look oh you're you're you're mashing x yeah because because i'm the last person to like
[8374.97s -> 8380.73s]  ready up so i gotta go fast well don't listen to him he's a fucking psycho i'm not saying anything
[8380.73s -> 8387.08s]  all i'm saying is that you guys better watch out for my suppressed gun i'm gonna try this i'm
[8387.08s -> 8391.64s]  going to suppress your audio well does it doesn't say what the next mission is
[8392.36s -> 8402.31s]  heading into the city i think it's more air things we need to so many is the same healing
[8403.11s -> 8415.53s]  the quiet threat weapon level up to level three armor limit 320 or less the plan was to head to
[8415.53s -> 8420.65s]  the city through the industrial area but look at those flying saucers in the sky we need to be
[8420.65s -> 8426.01s]  careful all right so is this like a primary error should i keep my anti-air yeah load up
[8426.81s -> 8435.56s]  sounds like it shouldn't do that i'm gonna use my suppressed gun on them i mean you did you have
[8435.56s -> 8442.82s]  said that four times now i think that's because the mission name is the quiet threat i kind of
[8442.82s -> 8451.74s]  want to try a missile launcher they're fun oh actually i have a my class has an item that
[8451.74s -> 8457.50s]  puts like homing beacons on things so that your rocket launchers will home them i was told not
[8457.50s -> 8466.52s]  to pick the air tortoise quiet sequel but the reload is two seconds you're gonna listen to your
[8466.52s -> 8474.47s]  chat oh the lock on time you know let them decide what you do uh do you have a problem with them
[8475.48s -> 8482.60s]  just use a suppressed gun all right i'm just gonna need access to your playstation account see there
[8482.60s -> 8486.76s]  we go see that that's what they changed item collection range is higher on the ranger it
[8486.76s -> 8495.16s]  makes sense it is the ranger here we go wow i like your uh net gun from the how far does this go
[8495.16s -> 8504.28s]  yeah this gun isn't gonna do anything look how far those bullets are spread apart dude this the
[8504.28s -> 8511.35s]  dentist directly up again i don't like the dentist gun very much hey come down here i knew this was
[8511.35s -> 8520.39s]  gonna be bad this thing sucks i think the ufo's are faster than my rockets
[8521.43s -> 8525.67s]  okay just gotta wait for them to come down here and then boom get suppressed
[8527.35s -> 8529.91s]  and not even destroyed get like slightly
[8531.51s -> 8537.35s]  inconvenienced we may have we may have not done the necessary research every start like retreat
[8538.23s -> 8544.31s]  hold on let me just see if i can kill one flying saucer i broke the bridge that was me i got one
[8545.27s -> 8558.76s]  i can't do i'm i'm not here don't fight them all at once i guess that's what they want us to do
[8564.42s -> 8570.78s]  actually this thing's not that bad i don't hate this anymore i can't like lock on to anything
[8570.78s -> 8577.62s]  because nothing is dude let's just run forward into the city they say one by one let's go
[8577.62s -> 8583.06s]  forward and i'll drop down the beacons why would you go against our intelligence my stuff
[8583.78s -> 8590.47s]  don't listen to chat don't listen to the game either so at full power i get it i figured out
[8590.47s -> 8598.07s]  the like speed run tactics here to die forward right at full power this thing does a lot more
[8598.07s -> 8601.11s]  damage
[8609.00s -> 8620.55s]  you guys just hit george george okay let's take let's take a stand here all right seems good
[8624.06s -> 8631.96s]  and i'll use my suppressed gun okay i've got anti-air claymores surrounding us
[8633.00s -> 8637.16s]  i have this gun where if they come into like melee range of me i push them away and then they
[8637.80s -> 8643.48s]  keep doing us a wind gun this thing i actually like this a lot this is perfect for this michonne
[8645.32s -> 8653.91s]  michonne walking dead wait what can't just come down here and i don't even need to go in the air
[8659.51s -> 8662.87s]  yeah we're playing um i wish i had a mouse for this man versus machine right now
[8663.83s -> 8669.83s]  once i get my own neck will be good well i'll just do something you guys can kill the
[8671.19s -> 8673.27s]  ufo's faster than my rockets can get there
[8676.23s -> 8680.58s]  yeah why do you literally have like the beam weapon that looks probably the best of this
[8680.58s -> 8686.42s]  weapon mission i know it just is i made the right decision somehow and i was just trying it up
[8686.42s -> 8692.68s]  watch out they're gliding in well i suppressed it have any of my rockets hit anything no
[8693.56s -> 8699.56s]  they like don't hurt us at all i think we found the broken overpowered weapon which is your thing
[8699.56s -> 8712.87s]  here you just got to kill a few more and then i can be useful it's fun just hovering around
[8712.87s -> 8720.09s]  just dentists and people look at that guy over there looks like he belongs there okay how far
[8720.09s -> 8728.18s]  can that laser even shoot across like the whole game oh but at 50 percent ammo it's kind of
[8728.18s -> 8735.35s]  worthless well i'm just the guy that makes sure nobody actually gets close because i can't really
[8735.35s -> 8740.71s]  do anything else i think i have to get out you're doing a pretty good job of just doing that
[8741.67s -> 8752.55s]  there's a couple of strays over here why would i even put on the other weapons so the blue ones
[8752.55s -> 8764.46s]  are just background yeah they fly is actually well when my rocket does hit it's really good
[8767.26s -> 8768.62s]  is this uh building gonna go down anything
[8769.10s -> 8775.42s]  we have no choice but to suppress you you mean like the gas refinery next to us
[8776.22s -> 8781.50s]  yeah that thing's gonna blow right all right i'm gonna go collect i'm gonna be useful here
[8782.38s -> 8787.82s]  i haven't been collecting anything they're all scattered around so far though it's hard to
[8787.82s -> 8798.06s]  collect anything i gotta get like a better view all right what we got anyway okay now i know to
[8798.06s -> 8806.02s]  jump up finally not really are we like done did i get my mech and then like the mission was over
[8806.82s -> 8813.06s]  uh i don't really see any ufos in the sky anymore so possibly unless there's a phase two
[8817.35s -> 8825.32s]  can i try the mech next time no that is not my mech no though i was told that it could be if i
[8825.32s -> 8832.57s]  chose this glass well like you actually have guns that do things why does your why does your mech
[8832.57s -> 8840.50s]  have such a big dick what your mech has like a gigantic dick oh it's like zone of the enders
[8840.50s -> 8847.30s]  where you you are you're in the cockpit you're like physically in the cockpit you know i'm out
[8847.30s -> 8853.94s]  of here like seriously it's even got like a discoloration on what do you what do you mean
[8853.94s -> 8859.94s]  what do you have a discolored dick what are you talking about like dickhead yeah but why is that
[8859.94s -> 8862.82s]  what do you tell what do you mean this that's like that adds to the realism what are you talking
[8862.82s -> 8869.27s]  about oh i got the dexter automatic this is the d and edf i gotta get out of here i gotta go
[8870.07s -> 8874.87s]  dude didn't you ever play zone of the enders i didn't play zone of the enders yeah zone of the
[8874.87s -> 8879.99s]  enders like you have a giant flying mech with a head but the guy the pilot is in a see-through
[8879.99s -> 8886.58s]  cockpit oh well when i played i was like 13 so i didn't really put two and two together now you
[8886.58s -> 8896.89s]  know is this uh flying again um it doesn't say we're safe here trust me it says monsters attack
[8896.89s -> 8904.01s]  mission seven so i'd assume okay monsters attack time to not do air stuff then time to never use
[8904.01s -> 8914.44s]  the suppressed gun ever again try the this thing every time star comes around we just
[8915.16s -> 8921.88s]  the conversations they just go off the rails i think you just don't like me anymore
[8922.52s -> 8930.52s]  like you're done with me cast me aside he's too vulgar we only make jokes about being short here
[8930.52s -> 8944.14s]  wait who's too vulgar me i didn't say any of these things i love the completion rate 0.7 percent 0.59
[8944.14s -> 8951.35s]  percent completion rate how do you have a 0.72 percent completion rate oh he played offline no
[8951.35s -> 8957.59s]  no you me you have almost a one percent completion rate probably how many items i found
[8957.59s -> 8964.87s]  yeah because he found items on two classes so maybe oh two for one completed it not even one
[8964.87s -> 8975.30s]  percent okay so i'm good to go german deny it i did deny it that's not true you guys want me to
[8975.30s -> 8983.99s]  be like uh is there any reason i should take a heal gun uh not yet once we start having trouble
[8984.95s -> 8992.30s]  it's based on mission completion with the different classes okay um yeah so that makes sense
[8997.70s -> 9005.50s]  you guys ready i'm ready oh hold on come on you're the expert you have more completion than both of
[9005.50s -> 9018.95s]  us i can't pick my level five gun throw up puke do it puke oh my god everything just goes off the
[9018.95s -> 9026.60s]  rails when you start hearing someone about to throw up wow talk about vulgar it seems safe
[9027.24s -> 9032.94s]  so how is this thing compatible anymore this thing can charge how much does it use
[9034.66s -> 9043.59s]  nice okay i get it let's get in there destroy the monsters oh it's the spiders
[9045.03s -> 9060.68s]  it is the spiders well this thing is fucking awesome i'm gonna drop them
[9062.28s -> 9075.08s]  these things are always scary yeah this game's too scary beware of the thread
[9076.04s -> 9095.62s]  yeah the thread comes out and goes it gets you disgusting really mute are are your anti-air
[9095.62s -> 9102.12s]  guns hitting them when they jump sorry these are like the same as anti-air guns except i pointed
[9102.12s -> 9109.21s]  them down they're effectively the same weapon but they're different loadouts so this is like my
[9109.21s -> 9123.75s]  ground claymore i don't even need guns you want to just die i'm stuck be honest this is really
[9123.83s -> 9135.21s]  effective games is fun to watch i'm not numb to it yet because it's my first one since like
[9135.21s -> 9143.27s]  the playstation 2 but i love how nonchalant you guys are about like oh yeah it's just this is
[9143.27s -> 9148.87s]  default yeah these are spider ones oh this is hey oh yeah the spiders i remember them oh this is
[9148.87s -> 9155.34s]  nothing just wait till just wait till the the game goes off the rails yeah especially when you get
[9155.34s -> 9159.42s]  the megazord happens to play this is this is off the rails for me they gotta up the anti every
[9159.50s -> 9162.62s]  no no no you're playing wait you got the bumpers on in the bowling alley man
[9163.58s -> 9172.76s]  well my point is it's fun that is a very good point i would agree can you not shoot me please
[9173.40s -> 9181.45s]  i mean i could where's the fun in that i want to have fun watch it here it comes it's going
[9181.45s -> 9188.15s]  to open up it's going to be saucers is it crashing i don't know i'm sorry going in a really weird
[9188.15s -> 9199.43s]  direction where is it going okay so the vehicles i get the pilot are they all from the support guy
[9199.43s -> 9206.46s]  or are there going to be like vehicles in the game that the this guy can pilot i don't know
[9206.46s -> 9216.98s]  if you here it comes that you can use it's opening something you can use my mech if you want right now
[9217.62s -> 9224.38s]  i'm kind of having fun with my uh my other weapon i'm melting your whole face off what the hell
[9225.85s -> 9231.98s]  we're supposed to be going somewhere i think we have to wait like ride on it with you that'd be
[9231.98s -> 9238.47s]  pretty cool what happens if you step on me uh i don't it's just in the air isn't it i think
[9238.47s -> 9243.51s]  i can try jumping try pressing on here here it comes here they come no i thought that was
[9243.51s -> 9257.80s]  gonna arc hey push right defeat all monsters so do you get to keep like a an armor buff on your leg
[9258.92s -> 9266.44s]  yeah so i'm bringing that also doing that rain hell it's on top of the mech oh so i place it on
[9266.44s -> 9271.72s]  the mech and it gives me the defense what if it went through them can i put like anti ground
[9271.72s -> 9276.76s]  on your feet uh if you jump up on my hind leg you could probably put them on there
[9280.07s -> 9287.30s]  oh boy bad kind of move i gotta reload i'm just gonna go in and fly through with like a full
[9287.30s -> 9294.22s]  phalanx here let's do it hold on i'm dropping i'm dropping oh you can't dash when you're using
[9294.22s -> 9305.29s]  that okay that makes sense if i'm honest i got one of them on i have like my own spider webs
[9305.29s -> 9313.72s]  uh all these edf guys they're following us yeah i got another one there we go hey you're very
[9313.72s -> 9322.20s]  well defended from a close range right now i don't know what that means that those like red beams
[9322.20s -> 9336.98s]  will auto kill anything they could pull oh all right i gotta collect lots of weapon crates you
[9336.98s -> 9342.74s]  gonna do something about it i'm getting them attention i am collecting them as best as i can
[9357.21s -> 9362.49s]  i don't think they used to like squirt purple goo everywhere i was about to ask if it was like
[9362.49s -> 9367.53s]  bad to stand in or if there's any acid damage or anything it probably is i would not stand in anything
[9368.41s -> 9377.13s]  that is on the ground it's fine god it's fine did we just win yeah uh why was that mission
[9377.13s -> 9383.69s]  significantly easier if there really is such a place the flying levels always are a pain in the
[9383.69s -> 9390.89s]  butt until you get shit like you had the anti-air stuff i think i got all the boxes over here too
[9391.69s -> 9395.78s]  i think it's a bit easier also uh germa's flying class has like
[9396.58s -> 9405.64s]  homing lasers that make it a bit easier yeah the power assist gun long range bolt shooter
[9406.68s -> 9415.62s]  three plus level two let me try that one short range more range not that much though
[9416.26s -> 9427.32s]  i keep getting upgrades for this but that's the the dentist beam lightning bow less energy
[9427.40s -> 9437.90s]  cost pretty good more range on the bolt gun and faster shot speed this is new we got a long
[9437.90s -> 9441.66s]  range weapon developed for use by winged i fire super high voltage bolts of lightning from a long
[9441.66s -> 9447.10s]  distance accurately they can snipe distant targets because the weapon is an early model
[9447.10s -> 9451.02s]  its trajectory may not be very accurate i don't know that we need garden posts anymore actually
[9451.02s -> 9468.71s]  i'll try okay let's go let's go try it um ready that thing is good but oh yeah you you did you
[9468.71s -> 9473.51s]  play smash you're you like smash i did play a little bit of smash not on stream though
[9474.07s -> 9483.34s]  oh so you're already over it uh no it the the online was the online was pretty terrible
[9484.38s -> 9490.22s]  it just you'd queue up nintendo i mean the game is really fun for smash it's like hey queue up
[9490.22s -> 9495.26s]  one v1 let's do some one v1s and it's like oh you want to do four player what type enemy types
[9495.26s -> 9503.94s]  for this particular mission it says monsters so cool maybe more spiders i'm gonna put this
[9503.94s -> 9514.81s]  back on this thing is really good capacity nine nine target lock on i feel like i'm the only one
[9516.01s -> 9521.93s]  that's like it just feels like move me same thing what the fuck it's a new smash game but it just
[9521.93s -> 9533.21s]  it looks it's just the same game i i probably don't know enough did you look account get hacked
[9534.89s -> 9551.42s]  what no i'm talking about one of my mods oh that's how he is
[9558.73s -> 9567.98s]  jesus christ all right let's see how this thing is i'm so ready but oh pylons pylons
[9569.48s -> 9577.46s]  oh look at this thing how far does it go and i wonder what how much energy does it take a lot
[9577.46s -> 9582.26s]  and it's very slow to reload oh hey i got that wait wait wait wait wait wait stand still italics
[9582.26s -> 9590.90s]  stand still that gives you extra damage you're good thank you very nice i think that thing
[9590.90s -> 9596.18s]  actually is a fun weapon whoops i accidentally targeted some civilians but you know what they
[9596.18s -> 9606.39s]  say about civilians this is really fast reload but they're all missing where did you come from
[9608.25s -> 9615.77s]  oh do you want damage bonus jarama oh that sounds like fun coming to me stand still
[9615.77s -> 9626.65s]  i'm standing still and still i don't even have to aim with this gun just power the dentist i just
[9626.65s -> 9637.91s]  let it do all the work i wonder how much damage is that they're doing can these people shut up
[9638.71s -> 9645.38s]  no they say they don't want to die one more time i'm killing them why are you so sadistic
[9647.83s -> 9651.11s]  oh well you were yelling at me earlier for spamming help me and listen to them
[9656.22s -> 9660.06s]  just barely had a range with that is your uh i probably should have picked a weapon that
[9660.06s -> 9671.43s]  was capable of doing damage to the big pylon boom i did good okay time to collect and what
[9671.43s -> 9676.79s]  do you say with what do you say we pick up some weapon pick up pick up some weapon crates
[9677.43s -> 9687.16s]  watch out for the threats i just blew that guy's teeth out of his head here we go
[9691.77s -> 9698.52s]  my frames my frames oh with the power of ps4 pro i have 15 extra frames per second
[9698.52s -> 9710.81s]  your mind okay mission's over oh look at this what is that supposed to be somebody will
[9710.81s -> 9716.73s]  fuck me right stand still stand still stand still you fucking stand i'm gonna shoot you out of here
[9717.53s -> 9729.14s]  what do you want hold on stand still are you like attaching c4 to it what the fuck are you doing
[9730.66s -> 9736.50s]  what the hell all right go what do you mean go there's nothing here yeah there's a pylon over
[9736.50s -> 9742.82s]  here why are they attached to me you they're attached to me yeah now you're like you're like
[9742.82s -> 9756.65s]  even better at shooting oh my god why is this possible like a glowing red this shouldn't be
[9756.65s -> 9765.53s]  possible that's not disco different era come on look at dragon ball z new grounds animation that
[9765.53s -> 9776.76s]  was powering up oh no i've read that i've juke it's distracting to me get these tools off of me
[9777.64s -> 9782.12s]  why do i feel like this is easier than like the first mission yeah because we powered up
[9782.12s -> 9785.56s]  man maybe we should be playing on horror well no it's just like one pylon at a time
[9786.76s -> 9798.01s]  i'm getting webbed oh my uh sorry it's alex hi there's something on me i need to go collect
[9799.67s -> 9802.63s]  these things take a lot of energy and i'm kind of wasting my energy here
[9803.51s -> 9812.78s]  i really need to conserve my energy you're putting things on me there's a weapon crate right here
[9812.78s -> 9818.22s]  oh that will never stop being entertaining to me here comes another oh god that's so far away
[9819.18s -> 9831.91s]  i need health where are the bad guys down here look at your mini map holy shit well you look like

[10061.75s -> 10065.43s]  hey does anyone here think metal gear is a good game oh wow i think it's a good game i think
[10065.43s -> 10073.48s]  sure school sorry we don't make metal gear games anymore yeah they do they made metal gear survive
[10074.12s -> 10081.43s]  i forgot that that game even came out it did i think i played it i regret playing it wasn't
[10081.43s -> 10086.39s]  it really bad yeah oh dude you can jump i knew you could jump that's what i was telling you to
[10086.39s -> 10094.41s]  earlier i don't know that and you can hover something in the water guys don't talk to me
[10096.55s -> 10104.87s]  you know i don't know anything new i don't drink water so no nothing new for me
[10107.06s -> 10118.30s]  i did get a bunch of upgrades though we will reach the city once we cross the mountain
[10118.30s -> 10125.42s]  we should be safe there i know i'm asking a lot but you have to keep going you can rest when we
[10125.42s -> 10138.26s]  get to the city bolt shooter that got a lot better that got a lot better look at the range increase
[10139.06s -> 10148.09s]  i'm looking at it dude nudes try it again great shot too damn these are all good
[10148.97s -> 10160.76s]  i'm looking at it and okay and i'm just gonna keep i think i'm gonna keep it on because it
[10160.76s -> 10168.30s]  just got way better but i will put the dragon lands back on still i need to get more of these
[10168.30s -> 10183.13s]  this is the one i have oh man i'm looking at it uh this is called escape okay so they're giving me
[10183.13s -> 10189.93s]  too many toys i don't i got c4 now too many toys you're going to have like probably two or three
[10189.93s -> 10198.07s]  times the amount of toys that you have now um well who are we fighting this time we don't know we're
[10198.07s -> 10203.75s]  in the mountains okay in the mountains c4 probably ants yeah i would bet ants and we might it might
[10203.75s -> 10209.67s]  have to start making us destroy ant holes so maybe the c4 will be good i could also do grenade
[10209.67s -> 10216.79s]  launcher tier two oh man here too ants don't live in mountains i had to buy that one for dlc
[10217.27s -> 10225.59s]  ah dude dude mountains are just big ant hills so um did anybody buy like the anime waifu vehicle
[10225.59s -> 10234.44s]  skin by chance or the pillow oh no i didn't buy i did not buy any of those things i bought the base
[10234.44s -> 10244.55s]  game not the 199 thing both shooter yeah they have um skins for all the vehicles that have
[10245.35s -> 10252.79s]  get a fire that goes on them what does this take 20 30 40 takes a lot if you charge this i can't
[10252.79s -> 10261.67s]  use this that often dragon lance can be used holy shit that's powerful i think i heard it was really
[10261.67s -> 10266.07s]  cool to see the the generational gaps in edf games or like the last one was a ps1 and this
[10266.07s -> 10275.40s]  one's a ps2 oh yeah it's watch out ants listen there's so many more polygons now
[10279.13s -> 10288.02s]  single target may have been a mistake it's made been a mistake i shoot green smoke grenades
[10293.34s -> 10300.86s]  all right what is the range is bad i took you the same surprisingly my smoke grenades are excuse me
[10300.86s -> 10308.28s]  my grenades rival your uh air calling i'll be using i'm using the wrong air calling
[10309.24s -> 10319.22s]  but yeah getting close yeah i'm gonna end up accidentally shooting one of you i'm gonna stay
[10319.22s -> 10325.93s]  over here whoop you can get eaten by the ants does anyone want to shoot the ant that's eating
[10325.93s -> 10333.05s]  me currently right next to stir um i can have artillery shoot it don't worry he spit me out i'm
[10333.05s -> 10339.13s]  fine he even gave me a first oh yeah yeah the red ants can pick you up and grab you help me help me
[10339.13s -> 10355.86s]  help me you are saved the range is terrible on this thing although it does kill in one hit

[12606.65s -> 12609.85s]  just saying i would have thought there would have been one by now but we're focused on these stupid
[12609.85s -> 12615.37s]  flying teleportation vehicles with their golden armor look they gotta pace the game you know they
[12615.37s -> 12620.33s]  can't just use all the enemy types in the first five missions they got all the boxes i mean it's
[12620.33s -> 12629.37s]  ants i'm saying they're usually usually in there pretty early you guys are gonna be so happy when

[13027.08s -> 13034.22s]  over your eyes so i don't know where your eyes are germa can are you looking left and right
[13034.22s -> 13037.42s]  you're just doing this little yeah i'm looking left and right because i if i look down
[13037.98s -> 13045.26s]  you're you're not decent just like in real life in where are you taking us we're just driving in a
[13045.26s -> 13051.42s]  circle no i'm driving us to the enemies get out it's enemy time so you can see me too no i don't
[13051.42s -> 13059.88s]  want to get out nope away i need you i'm not getting out you do i really need help
[13059.88s -> 13086.60s]  oh you got it ding dong dong that's the doorbell oh they've got me i tried to line up a bommie

[13095.43s -> 13099.03s]  all right collection time to go yeah i don't know if you heard me germa but uh
[13099.59s -> 13102.39s]  this character is not decent down there well
[13104.39s -> 13107.91s]  you gotta warn me in this stuff star hold on don't do don't talk to the chief commander
[13119.98s -> 13127.56s]  really the mother ship i didn't i reacted building oh boy
[13129.53s -> 13135.14s]  so if we destroy that thing so every time you get an armor it permanently adds it what's like a good
[13135.14s -> 13143.22s]  amount of armor to have uh hundreds is it just damage negation or is it like hp it's just hp i
[13143.22s -> 13151.34s]  think it's just hp at least that's what i think now maybe does that h see it says armor in here
[13151.34s -> 13154.62s]  but it says hp when you finish the mission but i'm pretty sure it's damaged negation
[13155.26s -> 13162.50s]  hmm it depends on the class the other game depends on the class yeah what class you are
[13162.50s -> 13175.62s]  it would mitigate damage different amounts here comes an air strike goodbye i would like them to
[13175.62s -> 13185.93s]  use some of the air vehicles because i can kill those um behind us it looks like it's like some
[13185.93s -> 13193.46s]  kind of currency thing it might be we're missing somebody is it one ant over there
[13194.42s -> 13206.52s]  yeah i got it i'm gonna do some driving i'm gonna make my way over this way it looks like
[13206.52s -> 13216.98s]  just a handful of ants i'm in oh yeah we're coming whoops so daisy okay watch out here comes the
[13216.98s -> 13224.15s]  grape is there a mother ship i don't watch out here comes the great happening i think it's just
[13224.15s -> 13229.78s]  these ants over here at the moment i'm glad this mission is not gonna show my kill i think i'm gonna
[13229.78s -> 13235.27s]  switch back to the class i think that's it because you guys are carrying right now
[13236.07s -> 13244.89s]  what are you you still on um i'm still on the uh soldier guy ranger i thought i was going to
[13244.89s -> 13254.74s]  get my radar whoa that happened i don't know where good thing i got this ranger before they
[13254.74s -> 13267.59s]  were coming for the sky now they come to the ground i'm being eaten very slowly oh boy they
[13267.59s -> 13278.84s]  have a lot of armor yes they do yes they do i'll save you oh boy juice because i don't have any
[13281.66s -> 13291.32s]  ah now i'm gonna get picked up it's inevitable it's inevitable uh yep it is what i just got picked
[13291.32s -> 13297.88s]  up but i can probably get are you down no i'm like i can i can get you i'm not gonna i can i can come
[13297.88s -> 13311.40s]  i'm coming ragdoll's pretty great my god stop eating me i yeah yeah i just got eaten again
[13313.99s -> 13315.59s]  who's with me inside the airstrike
[13323.43s -> 13329.19s]  did we just go into outer space oh no you're on the ground i think i'm trying to get to you but
[13329.83s -> 13335.51s]  i'm underneath a giant red ant ass you know you can still shoot while you're being eaten
[13335.51s -> 13340.78s]  yeah that like helps you free yourself yeah i killed myself with explosives
[13346.25s -> 13348.73s]  well that was a little hairy
[13351.61s -> 13359.91s]  i got you on the floor did we go into space well initially that initial explosion i thought i went
[13359.91s -> 13368.70s]  over the mountains this isn't just a world war it's a space war it is a space war any other
[13375.03s -> 13384.57s]  this isn't just a ground war we're from space plasma fall up we did get napalm though maybe
[13384.57s -> 13392.14s]  we should be playing with grenades plasma fall i just i need a corridor i need a long stretch of
[13392.14s -> 13406.17s]  land for it to work very well okay um we might okay this might be the destroy the mothership
[13406.17s -> 13411.13s]  mission it's a destroy the mothership mission then i'm going to pick so you have to shoot up
[13411.13s -> 13416.97s]  into it but i think it also drops stuff um so i need this to level up what's the best thing
[13416.97s -> 13427.93s]  i got probably this i oh you can use level five stuff now yeah bolt shooter no plasma
[13427.93s -> 13434.12s]  falling i'm gonna get rid of these special right now i feel like it's good but i'd rather have
[13434.12s -> 13439.83s]  more things to shoot so i'm gonna go lightning bow m2 i haven't got any more deployable guns
[13440.55s -> 13459.53s]  and go with this thing for the ships this is a stream what why what again why is everybody

[13935.96s -> 13938.44s]  he's just screaming and running away
[13944.02s -> 13947.14s]  oh they regenerate by the way that guy regenerated all of his body
[13955.19s -> 13962.07s]  they're hiding in the shadows of buildings germa how can we fight this enemy blow his arms off
[13963.80s -> 13974.82s]  jeez damn it am i not getting these rockets are they hitting the mother
[13974.82s -> 13981.35s]  shit oh it's an accurate fucking thing like half the things go through the motherships

[14000.34s -> 14010.10s]  i can't maneuver like this oh there was health up there not anymore
[14010.58s -> 14016.76s]  there's soldiers my gun isn't doing it like there's nothing about okay what i missed that
[14016.76s -> 14030.28s]  one apparently okay oh we all no wonder we're on all sides right now fuck okay this is definitely
[14030.28s -> 14035.64s]  better even though i cannot block anything uh we you know we got to focus oh my god we have to
[14035.64s -> 14042.20s]  focus on one of them at a time they're regenerating yeah the frogs regenerate i think the wrong time
[14042.28s -> 14051.42s]  to change classes shit oh shit i'm not my gun isn't doing anything fuck i'm dead goodbye
[14053.32s -> 14058.41s]  i guess they're joining you shortly yeah we have to focus we have to focus on one at a time
[14058.41s -> 14064.09s]  otherwise they're just gonna keep undertaking back up i have my gun stopped doing things
[14064.81s -> 14077.54s]  i'm gonna get my shotgun back that thing is just too inaccurate for me are they talking there that
[14077.54s -> 14092.54s]  was weird all right yeah all played all played did your mom i would do that so i could just sing
[14092.54s -> 14102.79s]  the theme song over and over again oh wait i had a sniper what oh my god dummy um it's not a big
[14102.79s -> 14108.63s]  fat dummy i think what else do i want though what would be good against those guys maybe something
[14108.63s -> 14122.39s]  like this what what's the thing that just goes which one's better probably power lance or spark
[14122.39s -> 14127.67s]  spark mine hey could you do me a favor what's up can you leave the call and then come back in
[14127.67s -> 14133.67s]  me oh is he's hearing staticky to you too yes he is i'm staticky yeah you're just static guy
[14137.35s -> 14144.79s]  hello i was apologizing yeah wait am i still was hello yeah you're still bad how i don't know
[14144.79s -> 14153.22s]  is either discord or i don't know yeah it might be that discord problem i had because you sound
[14153.22s -> 14159.54s]  normal stir yeah hold on i know the fix for it and because you use uh scarlet solo right yes
[14160.42s -> 14163.86s]  yeah that call hold on let me try and remember what the fix is wait a minute wait a minute wait
[14163.86s -> 14170.26s]  wait am i am i statically statically on the stream no it would only be on your discord
[14170.26s -> 14179.58s]  so go to voice and video settings on discord yeah on discord okay scroll down to where it says
[14179.58s -> 14191.02s]  audio subsystem yeah oh my in the advanced sound options okay echo cancellation noise
[14191.02s -> 14199.43s]  suppression automatic gain control quality of service uh lower lower audio subsystems
[14199.43s -> 14213.40s]  below that standard show a warning when yeah set it set it to legacy legacy yeah okay all right hold
[14213.40s -> 14221.74s]  on what the fuck is my back hello yep how do i sound you're better i sound better you sound
[14221.74s -> 14231.24s]  great crisp as clear as kittens so what what the hell was that that's strange all right well
[14231.24s -> 14239.74s]  but it yeah it really would be like that sometimes i think i like my preparation here i'm just gonna
[14239.74s -> 14245.54s]  fully charge this and drive right into their face i'm gonna just drive straight in and just
[14245.94s -> 14252.90s]  uh did you fix it i think so i guess cool when did this start happening like 20 minutes ago
[14254.34s -> 14258.90s]  it like slowly got worse and worse it did yeah i thought it was the same thing as italics i
[14258.90s -> 14263.54s]  thought it was my capture card so i just ignored it that's odd i have the capture card interference
[14263.54s -> 14267.62s]  too it would have been fine on your stream though because it's only discord that happens
[14268.58s -> 14279.61s]  it's very odd all right i'm gonna try this again yeah all right let's try this again i'm gonna try
[14279.61s -> 14289.11s]  to take damage modifiers up what's the range on this thing again so does each one of these
[14289.11s -> 14309.77s]  stack on me how much damage boost is this i don't know one all righty two that's two hits
[14313.27s -> 14333.14s]  oh boy well you're flying real low whoa oh dear watch out for the frogs okay when the game audio
[14333.14s -> 14344.23s]  gets real quiet and it just people going get me away from this nonsense i'm with tank boy
[14345.11s -> 14349.85s]  are you riding on the thing uh no i put the damage boost on it so i'm just following it
[14349.85s -> 14354.70s]  i'm gonna come back to you guys i'm kind of getting overwhelmed i'm getting overwhelmed
[14354.78s -> 14358.06s]  i need to come back with the team oh i can do a booster that's pretty cool
[14363.29s -> 14367.05s]  yeah you i haven't like seen anything you just like flew over there in a bit of fighting with
[14367.05s -> 14375.62s]  everything yeah it's turning around i'm buying you guys know drink drink drink oh boy you're
[14375.62s -> 14380.86s]  playing a drinking game in chat what did somebody say drinking game in real life
[14383.27s -> 14387.83s]  every time cat takes a drink we take a drink that's the game yeah that's the whole game
[14388.79s -> 14393.51s]  that sounds that sounds good who's drinking right now all right ready here we go
[14395.19s -> 14400.76s]  butt chug why do i always pick the worst fucking things to read
[14401.72s -> 14408.14s]  did you read butt chug i just read that out loud yeah i wrote that i wouldn't be surprised we did
[14409.26s -> 14413.26s]  since i don't know like you think you're being such a jokester
[14414.06s -> 14421.19s]  extraterrestrial beings similar to humans i hate that they say frogs are similar to humans
[14421.19s -> 14425.67s]  they are though you know that they stand up on two feet that's the only enemy so far that only has
[14425.67s -> 14430.79s]  two feet and they regenerate and they are giant and they're frogs wait you guys hold on you guys
[14430.79s -> 14435.59s]  actually he said almost identical to humans that's what you guys don't know that frog dna is actually
[14435.59s -> 14441.99s]  like genetically like the genome is as close as to humans as anything else say chino oh chino
[14441.99s -> 14450.97s]  oh you know you're not wrong yes frogs are genetically as close as possible to humans
[14450.97s -> 14459.02s]  almost identical yeah we're growing in batch just like those i'm just as slimy as them
[14461.16s -> 14470.65s]  that's because i don't shower i got an idea what are those i love that my idea stands directly next
[14470.65s -> 14475.29s]  to one of the canisters all three of us my idea is just get uh get the f out of here you know
[14475.29s -> 14482.81s]  i mean and wait till they spawn and then hey germa pick your head up pick your i want to see you
[14483.45s -> 14490.81s]  i got you i want to see you something is coming out here we go gotcha i don't think we're supposed
[14490.81s -> 14496.49s]  to defend from this like open no cover courtyard where they come from all sides oh he was like i
[14496.49s -> 14502.79s]  didn't even know he got shot in the head he just was like i'm ready to go guys break discord again
[14506.73s -> 14512.25s]  oh my god wait was i thinking that my gun last round was a mortar but i had the sniper
[14513.37s -> 14519.34s]  i think my brain broke last round okay i switched guns and i'm also actually killing things now too
[14519.34s -> 14523.34s]  so all right do we have to how much of their body has to be destroyed is this like um
[14524.14s -> 14530.30s]  oh geez man dragon ball z reference no it's a like a zombie reference they have to destroy their head
[14530.30s -> 14540.38s]  or i don't get it the whole body i'm dead are they aliens they look like humans come on
[14541.42s -> 14545.82s]  that looks like grandma just like humans they look just like come on
[14557.94s -> 14568.06s]  all right i will come rescue you eventually oh we have permission to attack them uh what do

[14754.49s -> 14772.31s]  what okay okay we did it we did it good job good nice work grenades and support equipment okay
[14775.48s -> 14789.53s]  i like i'm not getting anything new anymore now that's a victory let's go it's you it's
[14789.53s -> 14794.23s]  really good to see you in one piece yeah the minigun was doing well i kind of can't take
[14794.23s -> 14806.09s]  this thing off but this thing got better yeah i'll try it again the galleon i haven't tried
[14806.09s -> 14822.17s]  this yet i'm gonna give it a go oh i never summoned my capacity 19 what version of fortnight is this
[14822.17s -> 14832.98s]  um season seven one it's a good version dude did you see the storm king no do you play fortnight
[14832.98s -> 14838.42s]  didn't you play fortnight for a little while i played save the world when that's all there was
[14839.22s -> 14847.70s]  so why didn't use what type of enemies uh it's probably frogs frogs i would assume it's probably
[14847.70s -> 14852.66s]  frogs because we just got overwhelmed by frogs okay yeah i think it's frogs then i won't pick
[14852.66s -> 14869.38s]  sword guy uh but yeah if so did you ever play any of the battle royale for fortnight played like
[14870.89s -> 14875.77s]  one day when it the first day it came out i played at first and then i first impression
[14876.73s -> 14885.61s]  oh what was my first impression yeah well what's your first impression first impression was that
[14885.61s -> 14889.77s]  the random bullet spread was way too extreme and i quit because of that and then they fixed it three
[14889.77s -> 14896.70s]  days later and i never played it again anyway okay okay they fixed it three days okay i wait i
[14896.70s -> 14902.38s]  zoomed out they're like they're like roaming as if they don't know we're here so we i think it's
[14902.46s -> 14909.98s]  assuming that we're going to like this guy's still fucking alive he's still alive i'm still
[14909.98s -> 14917.96s]  talking how is this guy still living okay we need to stick together so when germa flies away and
[14917.96s -> 14924.44s]  does his own thing dude well i can actually keep up with you guys now all right so because i have
[14924.44s -> 14932.81s]  two behind us down the road down the road behind us i do see they're roaming but there's one
[14932.81s -> 14937.21s]  actually behind us yes there actually is one behind there is actually one behind us
[14938.84s -> 14949.72s]  he's dodging a lot actually to our right my god the accuracy the inaccuracy
[14955.32s -> 14960.39s]  that's that's the pinpoint accuracy i want things actually really good
[14967.29s -> 14973.06s]  dude they're just like humans well i feel like i'm killing people when i kill them that's going
[14973.06s -> 14979.22s]  to leave me with some severe ptsd oh fuck i just too many here why am i doing what am i doing over
[14979.22s -> 14991.05s]  by myself i cannot dehumanize this enemy i'm going back to you guys class dismissed i just need
[14991.05s -> 14997.29s]  to get my mech so that i can be a big human then you'll look just like them even more yeah all
[14997.29s -> 15007.03s]  right let's pick up some of this shit what do you say go for headshots really yes because they're
[15007.03s -> 15016.71s]  just like humans is that why that's what i've been told they are zombies oh i'm pretty good
[15016.71s -> 15020.23s]  at those headshots his head does come off and i don't think they can regenerate them oh my god
[15020.63s -> 15030.47s]  behind me what the just watching the giant frogman collapse is pretty humorous
[15037.30s -> 15041.30s]  they're just shooting walls oh dodge good dodge man
[15045.59s -> 15046.47s]  a lot of power services
[15053.45s -> 15057.37s]  uh any more boxes that i missed anymore maybe back here
[15058.01s -> 15062.57s]  i don't think i've seen a single
[15066.44s -> 15070.71s]  okay why is this one like easier than the last one yeah it really is
[15075.77s -> 15081.19s]  because they don't spawn in a circle around us all aware of us maybe true
[15084.90s -> 15093.45s]  headshot standing right next to it okay never mind wait what what i do
[15094.01s -> 15100.97s]  there's a big health box right behind you if you want it i got full health who am i next to
[15100.97s -> 15108.57s]  star no i'm next to an mpc that is just you but without your name this is a special

[15141.35s -> 15146.79s]  that's the first part of the title the second part is mobile why why did you play pubg on mobile
[15146.79s -> 15154.25s]  i don't know why does anybody do anything forward and i wanted to try it that was a well-timed
[15154.25s -> 15162.97s]  stream i got that was a double headshot that was worth it right there bingo i'll get all three of
[15162.97s -> 15170.70s]  them oh man i could smell it from here they're not singing anymore they were screaming but they're
[15170.70s -> 15176.60s]  not singing with me oh there they go i just come on blow the guy's head off he's like this is like
[15176.60s -> 15188.26s]  one of the strongest chorus this is the strongest thing i have is that kind of floating all right
[15188.26s -> 15198.60s]  fuck it wow that guy's dead i saw that so do you get to choose what your mech weapon loadout is
[15199.56s -> 15209.93s]  uh there's different mechs oh yeah can i land oh fuck what that just get the shit out of me
[15210.98s -> 15222.18s]  i think you're gonna slide off yeah you can fly so much longer than me mommy mech i'm going down
[15222.18s -> 15234.87s]  this side street it's not worth it i'm gonna go check for health found an enemy finally
[15237.61s -> 15250.86s]  yeah i'm doing more like walking around this yeah than anything yeah i keep accidentally touching
[15250.86s -> 15258.82s]  the touchpad the touch screen and they like run away and hide i don't have the time to go over there
[15258.82s -> 15269.02s]  here no he's dead don't worry i got it whoops my finger hurts there's one more guy down here
[15269.02s -> 15274.57s]  getting cramps too i feel like if my guy's so slow and floaty that if i just push the thumb
[15274.57s -> 15280.46s]  sticks harder i'll go faster look how far away these last two are well i'll see you guys uh when
[15280.46s -> 15285.42s]  the end of the mission happens now i'm gonna hit him from here i think you're the fastest one aren't
[15285.42s -> 15293.21s]  you well yeah i'm like i'll be there in like two seconds touching a touchpad is what is yeah the
[15293.21s -> 15300.74s]  touchpad makes it go emote you do like a random emote this is actually a lot down here i probably
[15300.74s -> 15313.22s]  can't do this by myself well may as well play with the civilians i'm getting there
[15321.62s -> 15335.59s]  this stream is my stream is jazz plus help me help me you're gonna finish it by the time i get
[15335.59s -> 15347.30s]  no i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm dead every time i say thanks i think they emote
[15347.30s -> 15354.89s]  at you no i hit the emote accidentally i think like after they killed you they emote taunt it
[15359.58s -> 15369.19s]  this is like the perfect gun for killing them nothing like the good sea shit his arms are
[15369.27s -> 15373.83s]  flying into the screen that guy with no arms rolled backward looks so cute
[15377.24s -> 15381.32s]  hey i finally made it pick me up pick me up before it's over so i can pick up all the stuff
[15382.12s -> 15389.90s]  i'm coming it's really not much stuff here is there
[15391.96s -> 15398.41s]  well that was not a fart i i would okay oh big plasma can i got leveled up nice
[15398.97s -> 15406.60s]  oh a dash cell okay how much not farting
[15409.50s -> 15420.06s]  pretty decent damage upgrade i'll keep it on i don't know more frogs of course ready
[15420.86s -> 15425.26s]  i want a helicopter already mom maybe we can go back into a hard mission
[15425.90s -> 15435.35s]  yeah we could stuff should i do that um can i pee after this mission or before the mission
[15435.35s -> 15439.03s]  go pee right now because italics takes like 20 minutes to pick what he wants all right i'm peeing
[15439.75s -> 15444.41s]  i'll be right back i'm gonna put it on the hard i like to have fun and i switch my weapons sometimes
[15444.41s -> 15453.48s]  peeing what was a quick easy one this was a nice one also i don't understand the difference
[15453.48s -> 15476.12s]  between booster and thruster enhancer but this one blood storm i'm gonna use blood storm we're
[15476.12s -> 15484.02s]  gonna fight a bunch of ants okay okay hard difficulty ants and red ants well then this
[15484.02s -> 15491.80s]  is probably not a good weapon um the swords actually might make sense here then
[15500.17s -> 15514.55s]  if that's the case then i would want the dash cell okay i'm also gonna pee because i'm ready
[15514.55s -> 15519.56s]  and you can start whenever you want oh maybe i should pee and be the last one to come back
[15520.52s -> 15611.19s]  maybe i should be the last one to pee and the last one to come back all right they put here well
[15611.19s -> 15621.46s]  looks like it's just me they all left hi no no i'm here oh i was the last one to leave and
[15621.54s -> 15631.74s]  italics is taking a poop he must be yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go go to the bathroom i'm gonna
[15631.74s -> 15641.54s]  go to number two we'll be back in 45 minutes yeah and you can go check on him like just stand
[15641.54s -> 15646.74s]  outside the door and like knock and ask if it's okay what am i potty training him no smell under
[15646.74s -> 15652.90s]  the door to see if you really want to go oh my god you are fucking revolting you are revolting
[15655.62s -> 15673.10s]  oh everything about that was so vivid and and descript oh god well i'm not the one who's uh
[15674.63s -> 15678.15s]  not showing up he told me i could start whenever i wanted to but we're doing a hard mission
[15678.15s -> 15684.63s]  german with ants okay hard ants we're doing the the mountain ravine mission with the ants that

[15690.31s -> 15694.79s]  equipment uh i'm gonna put on the plasma fall then because that's really probably pretty good

[15743.75s -> 15753.61s]  and descript one he's out of his mind italics is back he just said help me in chat perfect timing
[15753.61s -> 15762.28s]  all right this one's hard was not the perfect time oh perfect timing what's the perfect timing
[15763.24s -> 15767.08s]  like 10 minutes ago you're really gonna go do number two while we're all streaming
[15770.57s -> 15775.13s]  um that would have been the fastest number two in my entire life if that was the case

[16180.57s -> 16197.02s]  some kind of fucking quarterback oh my hands are so big don't worry i will get to you eventually
[16203.10s -> 16209.24s]  thank you i can't this like this weapon's physically impossible to see anything
[16210.04s -> 16215.48s]  hopefully he has epilepsy why were you standing behind the quarterback
[16218.60s -> 16229.21s]  what are you talking about i need help we need help now do you
[16229.21s -> 16236.71s]  find it unbelievable um where are all these how many is the case but unfortunately it's
[16236.71s -> 16240.39s]  how's that thing still alive that thing takes so long to recharge
[16244.22s -> 16253.50s]  wow no one can pick me up while i have this pretty strong
[16270.28s -> 16274.92s]  leave me alone bugs all right i'm gonna try to get some stuff there's a shitload of things down
[16274.92s -> 16279.86s]  there uh wait till everything's dead because i'm i gotta keep summoning these otherwise we're never
[16279.86s -> 16287.29s]  gonna kill everything no just defend your quarterback this is an emergency news flash
[16287.29s -> 16293.34s]  just made a major announcement okay now we i now now so again shit i'm not gonna do any more after
[16293.34s -> 16308.30s]  this one okay on it i'm trying to help you they got me the enemy is coming from the sky
[16309.10s -> 16313.02s]  there is nowhere safe on earth the earth is turning into a battlefield
[16313.02s -> 16316.94s]  and if i shoot it i'm dead so i'm whatever i'm coming
[16326.12s -> 16332.68s]  i know they're dead i'm dead only left is germabot we're all dead i'm coming
[16335.24s -> 16338.12s]  this is not a promotion for a film or a tv show
[16338.52s -> 16343.06s]  extraterrestrials this is not a tv show
[16349.24s -> 16351.05s]  it's pretty far apparently actually
[16354.74s -> 16358.82s]  man i should have summoned my mechs a long time ago yeah probably isn't that your special
[16358.82s -> 16364.02s]  forgetting i have them is that it we love it i'm just having bombs all the time is there anything
[16364.02s -> 16375.42s]  else is that the end of it i thought that's a good farm pretty good farm level alien alien ant farm
[16375.42s -> 16385.29s]  you guys like that band well i got level zero items from that hard mission that was really
[16385.29s -> 16391.42s]  that was good i got some really great new shit i did not spark find that better stuff
[16394.62s -> 16404.86s]  almost my first level eight guys i'm so excited class we can't be this might be too high though
[16404.86s -> 16413.78s]  a little six well let's do that one more time rapid mirage so i didn't get anything and then
[16413.78s -> 16430.14s]  the vibro hammer i didn't get anything so i can use rapid mirage that's a lot of rockets
[16430.78s -> 16437.13s]  oh i can use this too both of them and they're both really good 15 targets very cool let's try
[16437.13s -> 16451.77s]  it watch your back this time as you level up you get to wear less armor um i don't think so no i
[16451.77s -> 16458.14s]  think it's just you pick up those armor boxes and that's how you permanently increase your armor in
[16458.14s -> 16477.90s]  hp or will your armor my character looks like a toothpaste max spot don't let them drag you down
[16484.47s -> 16497.10s]  this is a double dentist is it i'm looking forward to this then rapid mirage oh fuck holy shit
[16498.22s -> 16504.94s]  next mission this mission sucks because after you beat that one it does one forward even though
[16504.94s -> 16510.06s]  you already have that unlocked what are we doing what do you what happened to you that was the
[16510.06s -> 16516.06s]  wrong mission oh okay that homing rapid fire thing seems pretty cool although it took a while
[16516.06s -> 16522.95s]  to kill one ant though that's really good on the flying swasses yeah i did get a better plasma
[16522.95s -> 16531.35s]  cannon though plasma cannon b level six oh oh yeah tell me more it's a level six it's got a radius
[16531.35s -> 16538.82s]  of 20 meters oh all right i'm not doing this now i'm not doing this anymore like that okay remember
[16538.82s -> 16545.61s]  stay behind we got to get ahead of these losers stay behind me oh i have no movement with this
[16545.61s -> 16548.41s]  remember to look at your mini math and know if there's an ant right behind you
[16557.34s -> 16580.14s]  shush come on alien ant farm under the window on the window a crescendo dude a crescendo on the
[16580.14s -> 16588.63s]  window oh boy let's try it out how do i use all that already well how long does this take to
[16588.63s -> 16598.20s]  lock on is this anti-air is this anti-air farm is this only all right i have not used this at all
[16598.20s -> 16602.04s]  so i'm kind of aiming in the complete wrong direction there's one on us hey what happened
[16602.04s -> 16611.50s]  can you guys see anything on my character oh boy punch him in the face um sir can you look at me
[16611.50s -> 16617.22s]  when i hold this button and see if there's like an away to assist me with it a way to
[16617.22s -> 16625.94s]  see anything right now no i cannot fire this weapon i need a beacon or laser target from an
[16625.94s -> 16631.06s]  aerator oh yeah i have to equip that then okay i didn't realize that that was what that was
[16632.50s -> 16642.68s]  but i now have a weapon that is compatible with it this thing looks really cool punch boy for now
[16642.76s -> 16648.94s]  drains me all right watch that watch the sides both sides why are you guys going up into the
[16648.94s -> 16670.38s]  river into the river it is a river star thank you ant for saving my life i mean oh my god
[16670.38s -> 16678.94s]  how he just how is this thing still alive i've shot this thing point blank seven or eight times

[17180.33s -> 17187.26s]  just start with my other loadout actually i should have stuck with artillery yeah i didn't know it was
[17187.26s -> 17195.10s]  a fucking ant swarm mission yeah get miraged i don't even know what these grains are doing
[17195.10s -> 17208.97s]  there are frogs it's almost like pellets i'm throwing hey buddy i feel bad killing this frog
[17208.97s -> 17218.60s]  he's so much like a human he's just like a human there really is this purple slime oh my goodness
[17218.60s -> 17239.21s]  i'm getting a little test in the body guys what the hell is that this thing just absolutely rips
[17239.21s -> 17250.46s]  through i've been using this before the red ants eat this it's my butt
[17264.15s -> 17265.99s]  i have to press the button every time
[17270.86s -> 17283.85s]  no he's not no uh down this road here the monsters my channel colors like you said and i just look
[17283.85s -> 17289.37s]  like a raspberry and blueberry popsicle just watch out for the monsters it didn't work out
[17290.33s -> 17301.13s]  they're in it together what's the difference between the aliens and monsters the aliens came
[17301.13s -> 17306.73s]  from above and the monsters came from below um no one knows i don't yeah what i'm doing
[17306.73s -> 17321.78s]  pretty far off i gotta get back here look like i came out of the frog i was in his stomach i need
[17321.78s -> 17329.82s]  to fly up there and do a little bit of spray i feel like i'm just like throwing marbles being
[17329.82s -> 17346.38s]  being effective i can't even see what i'm throwing well we're not dying as fast we are not
[17351.85s -> 17365.37s]  electricity melee yeah i'm shocking this guy's brain i saw that oh missed one yeah
[17366.81s -> 17370.49s]  well we're using these stupid grenades because it's so annoying to shoot my stupid gun
[17374.52s -> 17378.92s]  this thing's all right but i don't it doesn't seem too effective maybe when it gets a higher
[17378.92s -> 17383.32s]  rank of level because just yeah long as taking me to kill this regular just
[17383.96s -> 17390.52s]  ray and yeah that's how i feel i'd use like a level one weapon for this yeah i think i don't
[17390.52s -> 17398.81s]  know about that thing it's cool but it is cool but it's not as good as this not even close
[17399.53s -> 17406.34s]  let me get some stuff i hope this mission is over soon i don't want to use this anymore
[17407.22s -> 17410.17s]  probably close
[17421.69s -> 17427.93s]  what should be on a lead a pet yeah they're pet they're on our pet planet
[17428.81s -> 17440.82s]  where am i missing this one box above me or below me watch out there's humans over here
[17441.62s -> 17460.30s]  watch out these things are like humans my thumb like i keep pushing my thumb so
[17460.30s -> 17466.06s]  far up on the left joystick that it touches the touchpad and my screen keeps showing me those
[17466.06s -> 17476.58s]  options oh red ants bad uh man i wish i was other guy i wish i was ant kill guy
[17477.38s -> 17483.82s]  i'm gonna get the fuck out of here yeah i was really good ant kill guy last time as well i'm
[17483.82s -> 17488.70s]  sorry i just shot you three times only my hitbox was so large on this weapon
[17489.66s -> 17500.98s]  oh fuck okay like time to really get the fuck out of here i am basically the tank now though
[17505.66s -> 17526.06s]  there's so many raw guy back go to hell ants don't go to hell or anywhere they go to
[17527.64s -> 17541.99s]  ant heaven why why would they do that my grandma was an ant my grandma was a queen ant
[17544.57s -> 17552.39s]  can we deal with the frog over here please what the frog are you pulling a uh you know who right
[17552.39s -> 17563.34s]  now yeah i can't say it the joke is off limits why are you doing off limit references you got
[17563.66s -> 17570.14s]  you do only only references that are you got the syllabus you got the syllabus before the stream
[17571.26s -> 17575.38s]  you know it's allowed it's not allowed i didn't read it no one reads their syllabus
[17575.38s -> 17578.34s]  and that's what happens when you get punished for not reading the syllabus that's what
[17578.34s -> 17580.90s]  now you're in trouble because you want to make references that are not allowed
[17582.02s -> 17591.37s]  you're all right my gun is capable of freeing me from from the ant i'm on my way so you're
[17591.37s -> 17597.05s]  all right i'm all right but i'm gonna die soon if i don't get healed i'm dead i feel like every
[17597.05s -> 17602.25s]  ant has ignored me because i'm not doing anything those are some cool flips you did there to get to
[17602.25s -> 17612.65s]  me thanks man i was impressed i kind of need this oh fuck and this is where it all goes to hell
[17615.16s -> 17622.78s]  this is where it goes to hell squad following me true flipping around all over the place
[17629.91s -> 17635.19s]  all right so am i crazy and saying this in chat some some chat people actually know did the air
[17635.19s -> 17641.99s]  raider used to have the tanks and the helicopters and i was told that the ranger gets tanks yeah he
[17641.99s -> 17646.71s]  does and his equipment there was a spot for tanks like it doesn't like i don't know your name is
[17646.71s -> 17653.51s]  air raider you don't get the helicopters so air raider does not get helicopters no that's all i
[17653.51s -> 17658.71s]  want maybe because ranger was kind of just default and maybe a little boring for people they
[17659.11s -> 17665.19s]  decided to give the ranger some other stuff are there any more classes by chance no okay
[17666.62s -> 17671.10s]  they just took the four and were like let's just make up a bunch of things last game the jetpack
[17671.10s -> 17679.06s]  one was new wasn't it um i don't remember i mean i only played the the last one i played four i
[17679.06s -> 17686.26s]  think i played the third one or i didn't get it at all yeah air raider only gets land vehicles
[17686.26s -> 17693.45s]  and and apcs i feel like the ranger would get the apcs depending down for you know i got the
[17693.45s -> 17702.17s]  minion buster new stuff nice better plasma cannon watch out better grit shot get the minion buster
[17702.17s -> 17711.27s]  that's my cannon oh and i never used my collector thing that i had that's not really that much of an
[17711.27s -> 17724.15s]  upgrade but oh and the dinky motorcycles oh we're doing it we're doing a cave is it a cave
[17725.03s -> 17733.27s]  all right i'm gonna put on the uh anti-ant gear coming where is it this thing and
[17735.35s -> 17742.14s]  i wonder what else i should do maybe this should add a shotgun just leveled it up anyways
[17743.88s -> 17753.54s]  oh yeah this stupid thing this is perfect 1.5 completion rate yeah this game is absolutely huge
[17755.43s -> 17760.39s]  what wait we're just in terms of how many things there are to find i mean we're on level 17 on
[17760.39s -> 17766.95s]  normal yeah i believe like 1.5 percent through the content well because i think it's every level is
[17766.95s -> 17775.11s]  a piece of that percentage every difficulty so there are like 170 there's like 170 levels
[17775.11s -> 17780.15s]  each one of those levels has a different difficulty and there are yeah there's a
[17780.15s -> 17786.63s]  hundreds of hundreds of am i crazy or did the last game have like a dlc that added like 40 levels
[17786.63s -> 17794.79s]  um there's one you want to use the laser you want to use the laser guide kit for this or no
[17794.79s -> 17802.46s]  oh no i'm playing radio each difficulty with each class so there are four classes and let's say
[17802.46s -> 17810.78s]  there's 150 levels and five difficulties per level so you're doing that's five ten fifteen twenty
[17811.82s -> 17819.72s]  just for the classes two or you don't know you'll see that added like the dragons and stuff
[17820.60s -> 17828.26s]  dude i'm telling you it's italics every time that's because i'm being falsely accused of things also
[17828.26s -> 17834.50s]  you were the last one literally the last mission so no never happened literally can someone back
[17834.50s -> 17841.50s]  him up his claim because i think it's baseless anyways he distracted me from what i was doing
[17842.46s -> 17850.94s]  i like at least i got time to like stand up and stretch like if every time i'm waiting for
[17851.90s -> 17855.98s]  the game i'm gonna be jacked you only have one weapon per slot for your new character
[17855.98s -> 17860.74s]  should play something that doesn't pad the game yeah but this is really good just
[17861.38s -> 17864.42s]  it is fun just to kind of run around and shoot bugs
[17868.33s -> 17873.05s]  there we go oh i'm gonna love this level stupid bounce gun oh man
[17876.65s -> 17893.75s]  that is the thing is awesome all right here we go monsters just melt melt melt melt
[17894.39s -> 17905.35s]  holy shoot these grenades are huge going down the toilet drain compared to the little tiny fire
[17905.35s -> 17915.38s]  cracker things foxes do we get them holy shit it takes like 300 bullets what's my other gun
[17916.49s -> 17925.70s]  a rocket launcher the blood storm very edgy name i like it i think these the web spiders are down
[17925.70s -> 17939.74s]  here no they are some kind of spider the tunnel behind you dude this gun is so weak
[17943.98s -> 17957.19s]  just fill the holes oh boy fill both holes watch your language what oh whatever you know what i'm
[17957.19s -> 17967.22s]  saying yeah you're saying to fill both holes well what do you want me to say oh and i just
[17967.22s -> 17972.10s]  fucked up i want you to say there's monsters coming from every direction
[17978.22s -> 17982.38s]  dude these grenades are like bigger explosions than the airstrikes i was calling in
[17987.75s -> 17995.32s]  we're gonna have to use full force in both of these holes you really are you are quite a comedian
[17996.44s -> 18007.80s]  what a comedian no i want that help i am just you know repeating my favorite joke that i heard
[18008.84s -> 18014.44s]  from one comedian german 985 when did i make that joke when did i make that reference ever
[18015.00s -> 18025.02s]  in my entire life oh you're gonna sprint what yeah ranger has a sprint yeah press l3 hold it
[18026.15s -> 18033.42s]  wow welcome why is it zoom into my asshole because you gotta fill holes and then you have the longer
[18033.42s -> 18042.30s]  radius around your body yeah i'm pretty fast now actually i'll scout it out looks like we got
[18044.23s -> 18050.68s]  um and it like hurts to hold this down it looks like um there are frogs down here
[18053.43s -> 18057.38s]  are there frogs in these holes that is a wonderful question
[18059.05s -> 18070.34s]  and why does it put my camera in my butt there are aliens underground did you know that watch
[18070.34s -> 18081.59s]  the other side they're probably gonna come to you to the right that frog is dead dude i love
[18081.59s -> 18088.15s]  this grenade i'm sure the frog is dead yeah this missile launcher is way overkill for what we're
[18088.15s -> 18096.84s]  fighting plus it hits the my rocket launcher hits the ceiling weapon crate over here
[18097.72s -> 18105.05s]  well that was a useless item don't step in they will certainly become a terrible threat in the
[18105.05s -> 18110.09s]  future we must eliminate should have just been dash man i wonder when the bosses do you remember
[18110.09s -> 18116.65s]  playing this and we fought the gigantic lizard oh yeah that happened right now there's also
[18116.65s -> 18130.52s]  i'm like a queen in one of these caves come on burn them burn oh i'm dead dead yep i threw a
[18130.52s -> 18143.88s]  grenade just as a one of them jumped in front of me this thing really is so good this like super
[18143.88s -> 18161.61s]  grenade shotgun explosions hurts my eyes makes my eyes feel pretty great oh boy i'm gonna die
[18162.25s -> 18170.39s]  fall back falling back falling back dude they're dealing a surprising amount of damage
[18171.03s -> 18180.95s]  i just got him in their weak spots i'm just relaxing on the ground don't worry sorry you
[18180.95s -> 18186.23s]  didn't happen just to throw like a grenade over at us did you nope are you positive about that

[18253.30s -> 18259.94s]  so what am i supposed to do should i go look can we go this way okay well i can't get up there either
[18260.66s -> 18267.61s]  uh i don't think there's anything over here oh yes there is um what the hell am i supposed to
[18267.61s -> 18278.02s]  do about this there are people fighting in here maybe i can just bait them over here i like how
[18278.10s -> 18285.38s]  you just holding the left thumbstick as fast as me r1 r1 switch r1 switch r1 i have to do like a
[18286.02s -> 18293.03s]  like a sequence of modifiers to go this fast well this really hurts my phone
[18295.35s -> 18297.51s]  through any consolation a new species
[18297.67s -> 18298.31s]  species
[18304.07s -> 18311.38s]  70 meters long we're asking about bosses maybe this is the queen ant
[18313.06s -> 18313.46s]  probably
[18313.86s -> 18317.70s]  so
[18320.57s -> 18329.06s]  urgent if you don't call it like enemy omega well i'm very close so i think we're about to fight
[18329.06s -> 18340.94s]  uh the bad enemy the big one the scary one that uh it does sound accurate dude this room feels
[18340.94s -> 18346.78s]  like just this room feels like oh i'm just begging for a boss fight in here up top there's gonna be
[18346.78s -> 18350.46s]  it really was so dark in the last game actually i remember we had some of the fights in rooms
[18350.46s -> 18361.10s]  like this you couldn't see anything huh well we can really only go one way not really at all
[18361.10s -> 18367.62s]  actually do we have to keep going down we might have to keep going this way uh aren't they below
[18367.62s -> 18373.62s]  us according to the mini map i mean this we can we can go this way i think we have to keep going
[18373.62s -> 18381.58s]  the direction we were coming hopefully there's no fall damage so back towards me let's see if
[18381.58s -> 18393.22s]  you're right it's just on the other side of the map i'll be there in a moment it's just no i don't
[18393.22s -> 18406.54s]  see anything are we i think we might be lost in the tunnels should do this for us is that a dead end
[18411.03s -> 18420.38s]  oh down here oh that's just wrapped around really yeah i think it was the other way
[18422.41s -> 18432.82s]  but we came from that way did we so hold on split up hand hurts so much with splitting up actually
[18432.82s -> 18437.78s]  help if we get lost and can't find each other anyway there's nothing over here so it has to be
[18437.78s -> 18450.98s]  that way is there like a map of any kind up top right well i know that okay it's not what i was
[18450.98s -> 18460.74s]  asking maybe we just have to keep going that way wait what about over here can this is this kind
[18460.74s -> 18467.29s]  of like let's be shot down uh it just looks like a dead end is this just a dead end it looks like

[18476.39s -> 18483.03s]  that's a great question because there's like a line pointing up
[18488.89s -> 18496.36s]  and i'm about to be right under or above them i'm not sure which think we're going the right

[19806.14s -> 19810.54s]  like what percentage of dps compared to the amount of npcs there are well depends on if
[19810.54s -> 19816.71s]  they nerf the npcs or are they as strong as the player that's what i'm saying this on inferno is
[19816.71s -> 19826.66s]  just like how the fuck are you supposed to do this retreat uh pick me up i killed myself no i didn't

[20019.78s -> 20026.10s]  live gamer extreme hd or something the live gamer extreme yeah it's really uh
[20032.86s -> 20044.60s]  live gamer extreme hd 2 hd 2 uh i just remember the beast level with the weird robots that lasted
[20044.60s -> 20056.79s]  like 40 minutes for that one that was the worst level you just bought the same 100 robots and the
[20056.79s -> 20062.63s]  you had to like go across there's other mission to destroy ant hills like oh the beach that's
[20062.63s -> 20067.27s]  what you meant yeah i fucking love the beach level i've played the beach level over and over
[20067.27s -> 20075.83s]  and over again me and arcade and played the beach level like a hundred times well here we are enjoy
[20076.55s -> 20088.82s]  so what's so good about this nothing oh i didn't do as much as i wanted to i'll be honest
[20091.24s -> 20097.75s]  it's like the air raid is doing the majority of the damage here yeah what's new the beach level
[20098.87s -> 20113.14s]  please reply please respond i sent a message at least 10 minutes ago please respond all right well
[20113.14s -> 20125.75s]  these guns suck like just terrible they are lower level but whatever so yeah now i remember why you
[20125.75s -> 20132.47s]  like the beach level because it drops a ton well yeah you get a shit ton of loot and there's just
[20132.47s -> 20139.06s]  so much stuff to fight are we playing the same game i'm confused what do you mean i didn't what
[20139.06s -> 20145.70s]  is this this is edf5 right yeah no the beach level was different the other one was it
[20146.50s -> 20155.46s]  i mean they do kind of bleed together but do you happen to know what did they change
[20156.18s -> 20163.05s]  i mean it's definitely new stuff no this is very different you don't i know i'm just i'm making a
[20163.05s -> 20169.13s]  statement well not very i don't want to say it's very different but yeah i'm just making a statement
[20169.13s -> 20172.73s]  if the last one was edf 4.1 this one's like 4.3
[20176.25s -> 20180.15s]  hey you don't know what's in the end game could be anything
[20180.87s -> 20195.38s]  i'm not sure these are going very far oh okay i'm gonna sneeze i hope you're ready for it
[20196.18s -> 20207.98s]  i can't mute because you heard the man hide behind the tanks let them handle
[20208.62s -> 20224.39s]  big boy job that sounded like something in the game dude if i don't get a new weapon this time
[20224.39s -> 20228.47s]  i'm gonna complain about it and sound like a whining loser put it on the forums for the game
[20229.43s -> 20238.58s]  forum complain to the devs okay they'll fix it before it becomes out of beta i remember this
[20238.58s -> 20243.94s]  this level is it goes pretty quick though doesn't it so i have to like be on top of this i mean
[20243.94s -> 20253.26s]  there could be another wave i don't know i'm gonna need to move the fuck around because this level
[20253.26s -> 20265.90s]  was just a shitload from this it's pretty similar i'm very stuck honestly it no it's not the same
[20265.90s -> 20272.38s]  map but like no we're really trying to be the same mission i will let you get that gun because
[20272.38s -> 20277.42s]  it's very far away i'm just kind of skating around collecting the things that i can get
[20278.78s -> 20289.13s]  it's over okay so how do i do the full song of what's apparently there's a full song
[20290.87s -> 20293.19s]  if you do it around other soldiers they sing it with you
[20294.15s -> 20300.01s]  oh i ran out of power you might be in the gesture of d-pad options
[20301.53s -> 20311.10s]  it's probably a bad time for this and i'm i can't move oh hey i think i got most of them
[20311.66s -> 20315.70s]  yeah i deserve that i don't know i know i deserve this
[20321.02s -> 20331.64s]  holy shit god that was oh my goodness that was a lot danger close oh what happened again i got hit
[20331.64s -> 20350.01s]  again you can get in the mech if you want i'm calling a lot of air strikes oh okay i need to
[20350.01s -> 20359.72s]  get some shit oh don't grab me he's right above me who is able to stand against the enemies
[20359.72s -> 20366.86s]  the situation is becoming more we have the upper hand yes it is the situation has become stagnant
[20366.86s -> 20377.82s]  i'm gonna go back to the beach to collect yeah make sure you persist i'm being very persistent
[20377.82s -> 20382.25s]  on my collection
[20385.98s -> 20391.10s]  yeah one of the classes does just kind of call airstrikes what do we have for like a standard
[20391.10s -> 20397.02s]  weapon do you have do you have a standard weapon um they have the limbic guns which is like you
[20397.02s -> 20402.70s]  shoot detonatable explosives and they have like smaller airstrikes they can call them like
[20402.70s -> 20407.58s]  individual ones that reload pretty quickly but uh the way the airstrikes work is when
[20408.94s -> 20412.62s]  they take points to call in and you get points for killing things so these missions where there's
[20412.62s -> 20420.70s]  like a thousand ants like every airstrike refills your airstrike that's cool that's very cool
[20427.03s -> 20432.07s]  all right i think i got most i'm having a bunch of these like flying girls dancing like flying
[20432.07s -> 20437.83s]  all over my giant mech saying party time wow i'm married and it's really hard right now
[20437.99s -> 20443.10s]  made it in time is it we suffered heavy casualties we saved several survivors
[20445.72s -> 20453.29s]  well see if ashley wants to get in on it so you know that she doesn't she never does
[20457.03s -> 20460.07s]  look at all those weapons i got for us do you see how many i picked up
[20460.79s -> 20470.04s]  oh i got i got some it says new i got new stuff for other classes so did i
[20470.12s -> 20483.26s]  but it's like the same thing all level zeros though but some level ups please unmute your mic
[20484.30s -> 20496.92s]  your phone is muted and i'm going to mute you prize attack at night bolt gun
[20499.93s -> 20504.25s]  do you want to do that one again i think we're fighting frogs this time for the record okay
[20504.97s -> 20514.79s]  i got a pretty good frog killer i don't radius that's better this whole opportunity
[20515.75s -> 20528.81s]  i don't think i'm gonna use that plasma cannon b i don't like plasma cannon b
[20528.81s -> 20542.14s]  i just don't i'm sorry i do want to use the power lance right oh yeah power lance me what
[20542.86s -> 20548.34s]  yeah it was power lance i don't think enough i mean i have a shitty version of it but it was
[20548.34s -> 20562.60s]  really good oh dude the suppressed gun and then the grid shot 116 118
[20563.72s -> 20573.85s]  let's get some more light what do you say jerma there's a technical issue
[20574.66s -> 20588.17s]  please tell me what it is and i will try to fix it jerma wake up spiders spiders
[20588.89s -> 20595.61s]  your shoes are untied i'm not wearing shoes oh my god this is ugly oh i thought we were
[20595.61s -> 20600.33s]  indoors or something i had a whole bunch of airstrikes what are we doing up here i don't know
[20600.33s -> 20609.38s]  this is a very ugly mission though well it's night time so that oh i see the frogs frogs
[20609.38s -> 20618.36s]  i don't have any booster yeah just like sitting over here they're just this is their natural
[20618.36s -> 20628.65s]  habitat man all the way down i've destroyed all the industry mission complete see if we can
[20628.65s -> 20649.11s]  lock on that was pretty cool yeah god oh i can't just stand still like that i guess he's dead
[20649.83s -> 20657.58s]  because the rocket stopped yeah it is midnight it's too late oh yeah that's growing red i keep
[20657.58s -> 20669.22s]  forgetting that you were two hours behind you yeah but it's not that means i haven't like gotten to
[20669.22s -> 20681.18s]  shoot at something yet well then maybe you should try harder it's pretty good no i'll get that guy
[20681.18s -> 20693.48s]  i lit that guy up that guy's just rolling around can i lock on to two okay there may be a few too
[20693.48s -> 20699.96s]  many people here that one hit this air shot i have to log on to them one at a time i want a better
[20699.96s -> 20706.65s]  version of this i want this thing at level three or something yeah this one was like even more
[20706.65s -> 20709.93s]  rockets would be amazing this thing is so good against these guys in the head
[20715.10s -> 20727.78s]  how i think i'm a lot more of these you know i want a better version what the fuck is happening
[20728.50s -> 20741.13s]  oh dear all right i'm not going over there watch out it's gonna explode wherever you want
[20750.26s -> 20758.54s]  can you believe how good this guy is whoa that didn't look good all right i'm gonna go collect
[20759.34s -> 20764.86s]  have fun have fun kids what was it on the game we played a long time ago where you had like somebody
[20764.86s -> 20771.91s]  always had to go gather stuff every few seconds like there was always someone in charge of going
[20771.91s -> 20778.57s]  together someone had a machine it probably was man versus machine actually yeah you had to go
[20778.57s -> 20786.18s]  like yeah yeah yeah plenty of time played it we played it a bunch everybody had to gather like
[20786.18s -> 20799.50s]  pick up the drops oh don't kill me please yeah that's a scout when the scout everyone that's how
[20799.50s -> 20809.66s]  you get money and the scout then gets healed and overhealed the more money he picks up damien
[20809.66s -> 20815.22s]  you really get out of the way where's the moat what i'm going to get the frog over here
[20816.76s -> 20821.58s]  so i'm not saying a lot there's a lot of frogs everywhere the one that's being annoying to me
[20821.58s -> 20828.65s]  this one getting this one get him the one that was marked the one that was just being annoying
[20828.65s -> 20845.75s]  to me now you get this shot it just makes me randy oh yeah okay i gotta back it up
[20849.14s -> 20855.78s]  oh yeah i'm dropping the bombs okay bomb street bombs street that was close
[20856.50s -> 20871.06s]  air shot got it don't you even fucking talk to me about air shot now there's a giant frog behind us
[20871.06s -> 20881.53s]  don't worry i'm on the case oh another frog i'm on the case i don't know where the hell he's going
[20881.53s -> 20888.14s]  see anything right now when i'm circled by this red bubble is getting out of hand okay sorry for
[20888.14s -> 20894.14s]  trying to help you i'm gonna die the performance of the three are you i'll protect you guys got
[20894.14s -> 20900.38s]  fucking with my shield annihilated space after all it's unlikely they brought submarines with them
[20904.30s -> 20908.46s]  i heard submarine yeah it's unlikely they brought submarines with them
[20908.46s -> 20912.30s]  to take advantage of this opportunity well they are from outer space didn't you hear him he
[20912.30s -> 20923.56s]  clarified that he made sure you realized that such an overkill for a spider is it wouldn't you like
[20923.56s -> 20933.86s]  have an orbital missile destroy the whole house down i found one spider don't worry germa i've got
[20933.86s -> 20942.81s]  them there you go scorpion burn the house and he's already dead he is dead uh-oh lots of stuff to get

[21036.62s -> 21041.74s]  time and realize it's bad it probably is bad the lock on time is 31 seconds
[21044.22s -> 21050.62s]  but it does 4529 damage okay now yeah let's do that no i'm not i'm not bored i'm that's my like
[21050.62s -> 21055.75s]  this is fucking awesome kill the building just we're playing with somebody right now that it's

[21061.21s -> 21067.77s]  to be in germa made a commitment to each other i think i'm gonna hold on let me change one more
[21068.49s -> 21079.83s]  look at the big cannon um yes me too actually are you doing anything for like christmas

[21119.99s -> 21127.35s]  that's a i think we have to destroy the giant rub from smash oh is this a ufo one
[21128.15s -> 21133.67s]  yeah i really don't have this stuff for this either yeah i don't either here let's at least
[21133.67s -> 21139.51s]  try your thing i'll put a laser on one of them well it's gonna just 4 000 damage it should be on
[21139.51s -> 21145.67s]  like a larger than a single ufo don't you want to at least see it and i'm gonna reset yeah
[21150.39s -> 21156.55s]  this thing is really really good i see it hang on locking on i will be don't kill it guys
[21156.55s -> 21159.35s]  okay what i gotta wait 30 seconds to lock on to this
[21164.38s -> 21170.97s]  hey it's ready there it goes this all away that was a big missile i think someone just blew it up
[21172.09s -> 21182.62s]  those things very good oh there it's running away it just hit a building
[21185.14s -> 21192.60s]  that thing was stupid that was comically slow that really was that's the worst thing ever
[21193.40s -> 21200.55s]  all right let me get the high ground killed all those people okay we get to use it on this
[21200.55s -> 21206.79s]  building up here oh my god what is shooting out here i have my bulge laser watch out for the
[21207.35s -> 21211.75s]  5 million cannons all shooting at the same time what is this lightning from zoos that's my bulge
[21211.75s -> 21220.30s]  laser the zoos cannon look at these bubble lights i mean at this point we're like
[21220.94s -> 21228.39s]  there's a bunch of jelly beans coming at us all right mark uh mark one of those like
[21228.39s -> 21234.70s]  forward cannons on the big machine are we even destroying them i don't know that's what we're
[21234.70s -> 21244.41s]  advancing to i think they're all shooting yeah give it 30 seconds all right i'm going in
[21245.77s -> 21253.32s]  oh there's too many insects oh did you already lock on to something yeah okay there's a lot more
[21253.32s -> 21257.48s]  swarms coming in a second wait you dropped it i had to restart because you lost the laser
[21257.48s -> 21260.70s]  so
[21262.14s -> 21267.34s]  ready and there's a mech in my way fire you firing to where you're firing towards the
[21267.34s -> 21272.38s]  cannons i don't know wherever he's marking it's going to shoot one of those cannons
[21272.38s -> 21278.50s]  all right going which one where the laser pointing can you see on its way it's wiggling around
[21279.22s -> 21289.32s]  hopefully it goes down where i'm trying to get a good view there it goes i think it actually
[21289.56s -> 21294.36s]  oh i didn't even see it it actually worked it killed that whole turret
[21295.40s -> 21299.72s]  that uh let's do that another 30 seconds that hey i'm already over here don't worry i'll get
[21299.72s -> 21304.92s]  all the turrets you guys just take care of them watch this even have guns check it ready tell me
[21304.92s -> 21310.52s]  when you're ready for me to paint or when you're painting i'm not doing it i'm doing my laser on
[21310.52s -> 21317.78s]  all these freaking hands firing my laser don't worry guys boomer mean you take care of you you
[21317.78s -> 21329.62s]  guys just stay you guys stay well stay you guys just stay you stay i go i can't see far enough to
[21329.62s -> 21343.67s]  get what is this pink was it is the pink what the other laser chases i yeah i'm pointing my laser
[21343.67s -> 21355.29s]  and it's going towards that how inaccurate is this gun got it got bullet drop what do
[21355.29s -> 21358.33s]  you mean this it is i'm i'm shooting at it right now there's a lot of these
[21360.09s -> 21368.66s]  it is though we've destroyed a lot of turrets that was way too low it's not working
[21371.26s -> 21377.64s]  i guess they mean like i have no activity whatsoever i can't even get up there is the
[21377.64s -> 21391.02s]  big blazer shooting no all right all the turrets that are shooting in that direction there's a
[21391.02s -> 21394.54s]  bunch shooting in the other direction but the ones that are shooting towards you guys are all
[21394.54s -> 21400.86s]  pretty much gone i'm going to take me 10 years to get over here i don't even know if i can get
[21400.86s -> 21408.68s]  up there i said two drums what about the big cannon should we be aiming at that
[21409.56s -> 21428.90s]  i wonder how effective that is are you kidding me how are you going to get up there well
[21430.55s -> 21437.62s]  uh-oh yeah yeah i can't get up there well here they come what is it trying to make me look at
[21437.62s -> 21454.25s]  drones a lot of them holy shit okay i'm gonna try to take out all the saucers that just came out
[21461.18s -> 21474.73s]  give them the bulge because it is one hit with this holy shit what the fuck is firing right now
[21476.34s -> 21480.34s]  uh which what are you talking about like a giant laser beam just came out of the sky
[21480.42s -> 21486.82s]  jesus christ germa that was like the first thing i asked when we started this mission but yeah
[21486.82s -> 21495.93s]  what i mean i i've been away from you guys the entire time i i have like a giant purple beam
[21495.93s -> 21501.21s]  coming down from the sky so it's not like the view distances i've been i've been taken out
[21502.41s -> 21506.73s]  i didn't mean to say oh he's been so busy being productive oh yeah what do you think what do you
[21507.05s -> 21512.10s]  think the cannons just disappeared on their own we killed like two of them just the two of us
[21512.10s -> 21517.78s]  well great i killed 14 look it's only because you're faster not because you're stronger okay
[21517.78s -> 21523.62s]  you can't wait to see your new movie that comes out soon faster not stronger what is that the
[21523.62s -> 21539.00s]  sonic the hedgehog movie all about you what the hell is what been asking at the whole game
[21547.85s -> 21554.18s]  giant cannons germa you didn't even destroy those i can't can you not destroy the big
[21554.18s -> 21561.34s]  turrets i don't think so not alone no this is just that we have we got the retreat order which means
[21561.34s -> 21571.86s]  you win yeah we won it looks like you can hurt them and then i'm like doing damage to it you sure
[21571.86s -> 21590.52s]  all back um is it dying or are we dying that's a great question if we let those drones chase us

[23890.25s -> 23896.42s]  and just have it be on pc i would if i could snap my fingers again after that i'd delete it
[23896.42s -> 23904.86s]  from the pc afterwards that wouldn't make any sense no this is not on pc this is ps4 only for an
[23904.86s -> 23908.70s]  indeterminate amount of time nobody knows because only the ps4 is capable of rendering these
[23908.70s -> 23920.41s]  graphics i mean it is because it's the only platform is on all right i have to collect good

[24117.16s -> 24121.32s]  you don't have you don't actually know how old you are i was doing i was doing the math like

[24127.48s -> 24139.88s]  28 are you though 28 yeah i am come on i just did the math are you though i think you're all
[24139.88s -> 24148.87s]  the i thought you were 31 no i was born 1990 i think you just made that up is that what you're
[24148.87s -> 24159.46s]  the one you're the you're the only 30 here that's may be accurate uh okay oh just wait hey just wait
[24159.46s -> 24168.74s]  you two you two boys just wait just wait yeah hey hey two boys here uh gonna be waiting for a long
[24168.74s -> 24177.77s]  time i guess just you guys wait you know a couple years before you're as old as i am now yeah and
[24177.77s -> 24187.77s]  then you'll see what it's like to be 30 over 30 well we'll just we'll just be regular 30 and then
[24187.77s -> 24194.57s]  eventually over 30 yeah and you you tell me how you feel on that next day
[24196.23s -> 24202.15s]  well even then though you're gonna be just as much older than us as you are right now so

[24211.91s -> 24218.09s]  fraud instead of robots that's right now how is this one any different than the other one i mean
[24218.09s -> 24229.58s]  again maybe it's more damage for long range support what's the objective kill this thing
[24229.58s -> 24237.59s]  is kind of good but it takes a ton of power it's not that good
[24242.15s -> 24267.38s]  everyone's getting old you're not old until you're forgotten my plan for this show young
[24270.02s -> 24274.42s]  and i'm old yeah i mean we're not gonna be 30 for at least like 12 years
