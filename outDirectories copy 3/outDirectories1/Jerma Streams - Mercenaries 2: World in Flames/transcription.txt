[0.57s -> 14.07s]  Is it mercenary or mercenary? Is it M-E-R-C-E-N or C-A-N? Is it mercenary or mercenaries? Mercenary,
[14.07s -> 29.93s]  right? Yeah, yeah, with an E. I had it right. No, no, no, no, hold on. It's M-E-C-M-E-R-C-A-N?
[32.47s -> 42.78s]  Whatever, I don't care. It's merc- mercenaries? Mercenary. No, it- my phone's not telling me it's
[42.86s -> 52.62s]  wrong. I'm just waiting. Mercenaries. All right. Hello. Hi. Welcome, everybody. Welcome back.
[52.62s -> 60.86s]  Hope you had a good weekend. Welcome back to the stream. Today, I guess you just heard it,
[60.86s -> 68.89s]  we're going to be playing Mercenaries 2. There's a funny story about this one. This is on PC.
[69.77s -> 75.26s]  Didn't want it to be on PC. I wanted it to be on PlayStation 3, but unfortunately,
[76.14s -> 83.11s]  I couldn't get this game to get- I couldn't get my PlayStation 3 to get captured. I was trying to
[83.11s -> 87.37s]  capture my PlayStation 3 and it wouldn't work anymore. I don't know what happened. We played
[87.37s -> 93.83s]  the Olympics game, like, 12 days ago, right? Like, last week? A week and a half ago? What happened?
[94.39s -> 99.90s]  I don't know- I don't know what happened. I was trying to figure this out for, like,
[99.90s -> 102.86s]  a fucking hour. I was supposed to start an hour ago. I was ready- I was here ready to go.
[104.25s -> 109.38s]  I don't know why I wouldn't get captured. It was- no, not- it- not the- I mean, I streamed from
[109.38s -> 116.62s]  this exact setup 12 days ago. I didn't change anything. Was there a Windows update or, like,
[116.62s -> 125.10s]  an OBS update within the last 10 days? It- something got fucked up. I've no- yes,
[125.10s -> 136.36s]  there was. Okay. Of course. There was a PS3 update. There was a Windows update, like,
[136.36s -> 146.15s]  five days ago. Okay, I think- I think we may have found the culprit then. What are they even doing
[146.15s -> 153.48s]  anymore? Can we just talk about this very briefly? What the fuck are they updating? What are they
[153.48s -> 160.12s]  even doing? Like, the operating system is- just works. Just fix- what else could you be adding?
[164.52s -> 169.96s]  Okay, I understand, like, security holes, right? Fix the security holes and, like, fix the bugs.
[170.68s -> 175.74s]  But, like, I don't give a shit about any of the new features you add. You know what I've been
[175.74s -> 183.22s]  sitting on the Windows, like, update? There's, like, a features. Windows features. Please install me.
[183.22s -> 186.10s]  It's been, like, a year and a half. I'm like, no, fucking get out of here. I don't want you.
[186.10s -> 196.86s]  I don't know what it adds. What does it add? Like, yeah. Let me see what it adds. I'm curious.
[197.50s -> 204.82s]  I want to read it. And I'll tell you if any of these things are things that I would ever use.
[205.54s -> 219.11s]  Okay, let's see. What does it got? Okay, learn more. Okay, this one. This is for, uh, okay.
[219.99s -> 233.69s]  Great news. What's new? Here we go. Troubleshooting. Wait, there's only a troubleshooting list.
[239.62s -> 243.46s]  Hey guys, here's the new Windows update. Here's what it adds. It breaks everything,
[243.46s -> 253.08s]  and here's a list of how you fix it when we break it. Windows 10 versions. Okay,
[253.08s -> 259.00s]  Windows 10 versions 1909 and 1903 share a common core operating system and an identical set of
[259.00s -> 263.74s]  system files. As a result, the new features in Windows 10 were included in the recent monthly
[263.74s -> 269.72s]  quarterly update for Windows 10, but they're currently in a dormant state. These new features
[269.72s -> 274.92s]  will remain dormant until they are turned on using an enablement package, which is a small,
[274.92s -> 284.38s]  quick to install master switch that simply activates Windows 10. What? Why do they have
[284.38s -> 289.98s]  like a dormant ancient creature that's being built into the Windows 10 update? I'm not going to
[289.98s -> 301.10s]  enable that. I don't want this Cthulhu fucking update on my computer. No, just fix the security
[301.10s -> 320.79s]  bugs. Anyways, an Eldritch update. An Eldritch update. That's so perfect. I'm not enabling that.
[320.79s -> 325.99s]  No, I don't want that. I don't want a dormant fucking Microsoft computer monster on here.
[326.63s -> 329.75s]  And then they just like they turn it on one day and like break your computer.
[330.31s -> 338.74s]  Why does there have to be a master switch? It feels like it shouldn't be there. It feels
[338.74s -> 346.30s]  like they shouldn't like turn on a master switch. All right, we're going to play Mercenaries 2.
[346.30s -> 360.30s]  Let's go. I already hear like explosions. Okay, here we go. Can you see it? Does
[360.30s -> 365.72s]  German not know how Windows works? I know how Windows works. I just, I don't,
[366.52s -> 372.87s]  I don't want all that shit. And I know everyone just says, dude, just use, just use Linux. It's
[372.87s -> 377.59s]  okay. Everything I ever hear about Linux or like any of the Linux operating systems, it's just,
[377.59s -> 383.11s]  hey, it's, it's just like way better. From my understanding, you've got Windows is like the
[383.11s -> 389.03s]  Best Buy computer that you buy off the shelf and it has like fucking Norton 360 on it already.
[389.03s -> 393.51s]  Right. But Linux is like you built it yourself and there's no bullshit on it. Is that how I
[393.51s -> 404.12s]  understand this? But the unfortunate thing is everything is made for the Best Buy computer.
[406.73s -> 420.98s]  So a lot of times you have to have the Best Buy computer. I know I don't want to play online,
[420.98s -> 431.82s]  play online. Wait, I have to pick my character. Um, I can't see the other characters. Okay.
[432.79s -> 443.72s]  Matthias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs or Jennifer Mew. How do I see the, I want to see them.
[443.72s -> 472.58s]  Oh, okay. Hmm. Jennifer duh. What do you mean duh? I like the cigar. I do like the cigar. I'm a,
[472.58s -> 479.14s]  I'm a, I'm a big cigar fan. I've, I've never smoked one. Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer,
[479.54s -> 502.33s]  Whoa. All right. Jesus. But Chris has a cigar. All right. It's done. Wait, runs faster. Hold on.
[502.33s -> 514.86s]  Okay. Which one of these guys has punches harder? Regenerates health faster. Hmm. Carries more ammo.
[518.50s -> 523.38s]  All right. Runs faster is, I feel like, all right, that's probably pretty good.
[523.38s -> 528.81s]  Jen to only to her friends is the most expensive mercenary on earth. If it seems like she focuses
[528.81s -> 532.25s]  on money and nothing else, it's because she focuses on money and nothing else. Okay.
[533.88s -> 537.64s]  Kind of a big fan so far. She finds it amusing that there are people dumb enough to think
[537.64s -> 549.67s]  that anything else is important. Is there, is this, is this like a video game? Is it like a cut scene
[549.67s -> 555.83s]  or is it just throw like grenades at stuff? It's probably low, but whatever. I'll be quiet.
[578.38s -> 584.38s]  This. You should have done the same. Oh, I got paid. I always get paid. I need your
[584.38s -> 591.08s]  guns. No one sees the boss. I feel like this is a machinima made in the sims. Jennifer,
[591.08s -> 597.32s]  this is Ramon Solano. Mr. Solano is the richest man in Venezuela. I can tell we're going to get
[597.32s -> 603.56s]  along perfectly. What's the contract? Last week, general Carlos Caramona and his soldiers attempted
[603.56s -> 613.08s]  a coup. It's made by EA. Oh shit. It is some great plan for general Caramona and his army
[613.08s -> 619.54s]  plans for Venezuela. So it's me against a bunch of VZ soldiers. That's it. Will you accept the
[619.54s -> 627.48s]  contract? As long as your checks don't bounce. I feel like I'm going to really like this game.
[627.48s -> 631.46s]  Is that the case? I've never played this either of them. Welcome to Venezuela,
[631.46s -> 636.98s]  Solano's paperwork. So we're good to go. Packed into a CIA satellite.
[637.62s -> 643.38s]  I can see you and most of the area around you. I'm working off a laptop connected to a cell phone
[643.38s -> 648.98s]  here. So don't expect miracles. Leave the miracles to me. 2008 cell phones in the right direction.
[648.98s -> 656.01s]  This is like iPhone four. You're literally coping. What? Oh shit. Okay. Here we go.
[658.41s -> 662.33s]  Accelerate. What button is that? How do I land on a bunch of
[662.41s -> 670.81s]  pointy rocks? Okay. Steer and then break. What are those? What are those? Objective added.
[670.81s -> 678.54s]  Land on the beach. Okay. But what, what buttons are those? Okay. It's obviously A and then what
[678.54s -> 698.70s]  is B? Break? No, B is horn. Land on the beach. How do you exit? Wait, do you drive cars? Wait a
[698.70s -> 706.46s]  second. Wait for a weapon delivery. Melee bash is use melee bash to open crates.
[707.58s -> 715.90s]  Punch. Oops. What's made? I already like it. I love it already. I don't mind getting a little
[715.90s -> 725.21s]  dirty. Okay. What's in here? There's nothing in there. Equip grenade launcher. How do I pick it
[725.21s -> 739.16s]  up? Did I get it? I did. I don't think I picked it up. Oh boy. This is not, I don't think this is a
[739.16s -> 755.62s]  controller game. I don't think this is a controller game. Let me see. Why are there no ammo stores
[755.62s -> 767.30s]  around here? Why do I zoom in? Right. Hold on. Right. Stop. Okay. Wait. Right mouse button doesn't
[767.30s -> 780.07s]  zoom in? What the hell zooms in then? Shoot reload. Why? You've given me like Minecraft pictures.
[780.07s -> 790.78s]  What's the button that I have to press? Zoom. Switch weapons. Yeah. How? How do I do that?
[791.58s -> 805.43s]  Q? Hold on. Okay. Mouse one. Primary switch tab. Reload is R. Secondary attack mouse two.
[806.73s -> 817.54s]  Secondary switches V. Melee attack F. Use E. Jump space. Crouch C. Binoculars B. PDA F1. Lookup I.
[818.34s -> 826.55s]  A. Support. Walk. Switch. What's zoom in? Sprint is left shift. Okay. But what is the
[827.27s -> 841.61s]  zoom in? Mouse two. I'm pressing mouse two. Wait. It's crouch. Sensitivity has got to go
[841.61s -> 844.57s]  way down too. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I like playing with the controller. Hold on.
[845.21s -> 851.50s]  Joystick sensitivity. Here we are. I want to play the controller. I don't want to keyboard and mouse.
[851.50s -> 861.82s]  I hate that. All right. Let's try that. All right. That's way too slow. But you get the idea.
[862.62s -> 885.62s]  Yeah. This is much better. That was not good. That was very bad. Oh, it shot. All right. Oh,
[885.70s -> 891.58s]  okay. That's how you equip it. That's a little too low though. Way too low. Way,
[891.58s -> 899.34s]  way, way, way, way. I think that's going to be good. This game was wild as a kid. You played
[899.34s -> 914.28s]  this as a kid? Open PDA is the pause button. It's the select button. This is a great kid's game.
[916.82s -> 924.54s]  I don't think I agree. Okay. Destroy the gate. Thank God there's a fucking fallout New Vegas map.
[926.10s -> 941.21s]  What do I do? How do I blow it up? Do I have to switch weapons? All right. Let's go. Dude,
[941.21s -> 948.46s]  you know what? Okay. My up and down sensitivity is crazy. Open support menu. Use support item.
[961.46s -> 974.38s]  Wait, satellite guided satellite mom. One for free. How do I use it? Use support item. Oh shit.
[975.34s -> 991.32s]  Okay. Over the target. Confirm. Confirm target. Do it. Go. Did I do it? Okay. There it is. Confirm
[991.32s -> 1001.69s]  target is. Okay. Got it. Oh, it's a mini game. Oh shit. All right. Run, run, run. Get out of here.
[1005.24s -> 1015.42s]  I mean, let's be honest. You would do the same shit. It doesn't matter how like hard you think
[1015.42s -> 1019.98s]  you are. If this an explosion that far behind you, you're not going to be like, yeah. No,
[1019.98s -> 1032.52s]  you're going to be like, Jesus. I'm glad that that happened. Oh fuck. Look out. All right. How do
[1032.52s -> 1057.42s]  you sprint? How do you crouch? Okay. Don't want to die in the tutorial. Uh, I have an idea.
[1062.89s -> 1074.23s]  So soft. Got them. Did I get them? Your AK is freaking out. Get to the way point.
[1075.11s -> 1094.06s]  Holy shit. That was pretty good. Come on. Dude, do you get cars in this game?
[1095.40s -> 1106.22s]  Tell me you get a car. Do you get a car? Yes. Okay. I'm, I'm, I'm incredibly excited. Wait,
[1106.30s -> 1113.58s]  vehicle delivery, vehicle delivery. Where is it? Dropped out of the sky.
[1119.46s -> 1127.62s]  See if it was going to crush me. Drive the iguana. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1128.42s -> 1139.13s]  Drive. Where am I driving? That is a full letter grade. That is a full letter grade. That's what
[1139.13s -> 1154.82s]  happens. Okay. We go back down here. Went from F to a D. Um, no, it went from a C to a B.
[1159.16s -> 1167.66s]  All right. Now it's, wait, now it's a B minus. Now it's a, now it's a B plus. Okay. I just had to
[1167.66s -> 1176.81s]  see what happened. You can actually do it. Okay. You can, you can ghost ride cars. Did I get them?
[1177.61s -> 1197.30s]  Oh, I didn't get them. I thought I got them both. Where's the car? Where did it go? Did it keep
[1197.30s -> 1211.34s]  going? Okay. This blend. I thought this was part of the rocks. There's a handbrake. How do I do it?
[1211.34s -> 1221.35s]  Okay. That's it. Excellent. I love spending other people's money.
[1230.55s -> 1239.50s]  Okay. She turned into a hermit crab. Why am I still alive? Okay. Open up the menu.
[1240.22s -> 1273.18s]  Satellite guided bomb. Where is it? All right. Take it out. Got it. Tank. Give me that ammo. Oh,
[1273.18s -> 1278.41s]  wow. Level destruction. Yeah. That's cool. All right. Let's go. Let's get in the tank.
[1278.41s -> 1281.93s]  How many different vehicles are there? Is there a motorcycle? This is a motorcycle.
[1281.93s -> 1290.09s]  This game's automatically an A minus. Steal it or nuke it. What do I mean? Yeah. Get in it.
[1291.70s -> 1314.57s]  How would I destroy this? Um, okay. But move, steer, shoot. Oh God. This game is fucked. This
[1314.57s -> 1330.02s]  game is mega fucked on PC. Is it? I can't, it's hard to turn. It's mega fucked on PC. What do you,
[1330.50s -> 1350.95s]  is that going to be a problem? Switch weapons. How do I switch weapons? I'm trying to do it.
[1350.95s -> 1363.72s]  Switch weapons. Oh, there we go. This just sounds like popcorn in the microwave.
[1364.28s -> 1377.74s]  I gotta make it realistic. Hold on. Do I take it out yet? Do I take it out yet? No, not yet. Okay.
[1377.74s -> 1380.78s]  No, that's fine. That's fine. Let's get it out. Get it out now. Get it out now before it explodes.
[1381.50s -> 1393.74s]  Anybody else have that irrational fear? You don't have that irrational fear.
[1394.30s -> 1399.42s]  You know, you're supposed to count two seconds between pops. If it's longer than two seconds,
[1399.42s -> 1411.72s]  then like, I, I feel like there's a risk of explosion. Get to the way point. Wait,
[1411.72s -> 1423.30s]  hold on. Can I just like, why would you stand up there? Okay. If you're this guy, don't you
[1423.30s -> 1432.95s]  dive off now. Why would you continue to stand up on this? These are houses. Wait, but there's
[1433.03s -> 1460.49s]  people shooting at me. Okay. That was, it was pretty fucked up. All right. Let's go the right
[1460.49s -> 1481.11s]  direction. Bridges out. Oh, sweating. Bridges out. Get inside the complex. How about we just blow it
[1481.11s -> 1501.77s]  up? Just take it out from over here. Why is it healing? Don't worry. They'll come out. Don't
[1501.77s -> 1514.84s]  worry. We'll smoke them out. Can you destroy everything? Wait, why is it being rebuilt?
[1522.23s -> 1525.59s]  This is just like when you're destroying a building in Warcraft and the guy puts like
[1525.59s -> 1529.27s]  10 peons on it and you're just like, get these fucking things out of here.
[1530.07s -> 1583.50s]  Oh, what's this? Wait. Oh, wait, where is this? Did I do it? What happened? Mission complete.
[1586.23s -> 1593.40s]  Wait, was this supposed to be a hideout? Oh, where's the rest of your team? I'm the complete
[1593.40s -> 1599.22s]  package. So you're a merc. He knows a good deal when he sees it. Let's get the hell out of here.
[1600.18s -> 1608.82s]  Jennifer, welcome back. Job well done. Just like old times. Me doing all the work, you nowhere to be
[1608.82s -> 1614.26s]  seen. Is somebody really mad that they don't have the premier project file anymore? To be
[1614.26s -> 1620.66s]  able to re-render these in HD, like full 1080. First I get paid. I'm sorry. The job is not for
[1620.66s -> 1629.56s]  you. The job is you. Tomorrow, General Carmona's troops will roll into the capital and I will be
[1629.64s -> 1633.88s]  Venezuela's new leader. You should have just paid me the money. I love money. This means there will
[1633.88s -> 1640.28s]  be many bounties on my head. I can't have your friends hunting me. It's bad for business. So is
[1640.28s -> 1649.32s]  this. Now I have to kill you. Sorry, Jennifer. You piece of- Why is it, why is it bleeped?
[1654.73s -> 1662.42s]  That wasn't even a bleep. That was like a phone touch tone. Why did she do that? Oh my God.
[1666.55s -> 1675.62s]  That was what the after the beep. If you like leave a message for somebody. Jen, please sit
[1675.62s -> 1681.22s]  down if you can. She got shot in the ass. Trust you to be looking at my ass. We're leaving Venezuela
[1681.22s -> 1686.74s]  tonight. That was ridiculous. I can't even process what just happened. That was fucking crazy. It's
[1686.74s -> 1691.78s]  not safe because I'm here and I am pissed off. Yeah, no one shoots her in the ass and gets away
[1691.78s -> 1696.82s]  with it. He didn't pay her the worst thing it could have done. I'm being told now that Ramona
[1697.93s -> 1700.17s]  was giving a press conference. This is a crack game. Yeah.
[1715.94s -> 1727.54s]  Everybody pays Blanco. I don't know. Whatever. What am I saying? Everybody pays. I blinked and she
[1727.54s -> 1732.74s]  kicked a guy in the balls from behind. I didn't even see the cut scene. I felt like I just had a
[1732.74s -> 1821.72s]  dream. What? Okay. So I'm trying to piece this together. Okay. I don't know why, but I thought
[1822.20s -> 1825.56s]  that was that guy. Director Cameron Brown. I was like, all right, this guy, this is a
[1826.78s -> 1833.50s]  solid snake. Metal gear snake. Whatever. Wait, you can steal cars? No, you can't. No, you can't. No,
[1833.50s -> 1844.95s]  you can't. You can't do that. No, there's no way. This is you can't, right? Can you get hit by cars?
[1847.75s -> 1855.11s]  Kind of. There's a motorcycle. Okay. There's a motorcycle in the game. Okay. It's an A minus.
[1855.11s -> 1875.64s]  Give me this thing. Oh yeah. Holy shit. Okay. I have to have fun. All right. Give me that
[1875.64s -> 1882.44s]  motorcycle bike. This is, this is too much stimulation. There's another one right here.
[1882.44s -> 1902.52s]  We'll take this one. Wait, is that bike? There's two bikes here. Wait, can you punch? Why is a
[1902.52s -> 1925.40s]  bike still driving by itself? What? I'm getting battlefielded? Wait, they have a out of bounds
[1925.40s -> 1933.24s]  like battlefield. All right. How do I? This is a first person mode too. This is amazing. All right.
[1933.24s -> 1942.52s]  I'm going to do first person driving. How am I getting shot at by? Wait, what's that? Money?
[1943.16s -> 1965.19s]  How is he still alive? I feel like I'm an animal. Like I'm a wild fucking animal.
[1971.18s -> 1975.26s]  Just put like fucking screaming like bear noises right there. Wait, I didn't get the money.
[1981.75s -> 1991.98s]  Police academy. What do you mean police academy? Wait, I think I know what you're talking about.
[1995.29s -> 2012.34s]  Okay. No, no. What's, what is it? Um, naked gun, the naked gun movies. Wait, there's a bad guy.
[2012.34s -> 2032.47s]  What's this? Oh, $25,000. All right. That's not a bad guy. Did I get everything? All right. Wait, how
[2035.94s -> 2048.62s]  what is this? Oh, requires a helicopter pilot to steal. Are you kidding me? Wait, what?
[2058.87s -> 2061.43s]  I have to do a mission. I'm going to lose my mind.
[2062.31s -> 2081.42s]  All right. We're gonna bang a left. Don't kill people. I've, what are you? I'm being shot at.
[2082.22s -> 2088.73s]  I do want a motorcycle though. That's way cooler. Will this guy fly over the handlebars?
[2089.69s -> 2116.14s]  No. Why would you turn into me? I'm not killing anybody. I want a bike though. I want a bike.
[2117.10s -> 2148.71s]  Give me the bike. Why is this thing on ice? No, get. There we are. Come on. Let's go. All right. I
[2148.71s -> 2187.77s]  want the other camera angle. Oh shit. Wait, turn left. All right. Turn left. I almost got it. I
[2187.77s -> 2198.78s]  almost got it. I just had to drive as fast as I could. Wait, how do I open this gate? Open the
[2198.78s -> 2204.76s]  gate. What did I just get a little jump for? That was cool. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2204.76s -> 2217.26s]  wait, wait, wait. Get a real car. Oh shit. There's a temporal disturbance. I'm pulling you out. I'm
[2217.26s -> 2222.14s]  pulling you out, Jen. No, don't do it yet. I'm not ready. No, you've been in there for too long.
[2222.78s -> 2244.81s]  What do I do? I can't get in. I don't have access to an airstrike. I don't. It's not. I don't have
[2244.81s -> 2266.41s]  an airstrike. I need a car. Use a grenade. Use a van. I don't have any grenades. I don't have any.
[2267.05s -> 2280.42s]  All right. I'm going to take that car. There's a car right here. Use your head. I've tried that.
[2280.42s -> 2310.98s]  It didn't work. All right. Car. Give me. All right. Open up. You actually had to drive through it.
[2310.98s -> 2322.22s]  You got to be kidding me. Okay. But it was like a little scavenger hunt. Is this supposed to be a
[2322.22s -> 2332.10s]  maze? I found it. Wait, I have to kill that guy. Did I get him? That guy had an elaborate setup.
[2332.90s -> 2347.32s]  Is he dead? I got him. All right. Imagine being that guy. Yes, I'm going to hide in the
[2347.32s -> 2353.35s]  elaborate maze that she will never find me. Boss, she's driving through the hedges.
[2367.50s -> 2370.54s]  Somebody, when they write about this in the history books, make sure you said
[2370.54s -> 2379.50s]  it took her at least two minutes to find me. Why did I just hacky sack that into the air?
[2380.14s -> 2400.30s]  Take ammo. Take ammo. We're out of here. Wait, what was that? I want a grenade. I'm going to
[2400.30s -> 2406.39s]  sneeze and I'm going to try to be very, very, very. I'm back. Hi guys. Welcome to the stream.
[2406.39s -> 2411.11s]  Today we're going to play Mercenaries 2. I have nine grenades. I do have nine grenades.
[2411.83s -> 2452.12s]  I didn't even realize that. Is this like Dora the Explorer? Oh, come on. All right. Watch this.
[2454.10s -> 2460.25s]  Here I. Oh, come on. Really? I thought the whole thing was going to come down.
[2467.35s -> 2496.44s]  Do you see? Do you see where Jen went? Nevermind. I tried. All right. There he is.
[2496.44s -> 2512.79s]  Wait, that's an explosive thing. Isn't it? Is it? Oh my God. That guy. That guy was like,
[2512.79s -> 2530.81s]  Holy shit. It didn't get me. Machine pistol. Oh, he just took him right in the lip. All right. I
[2530.81s -> 2542.79s]  got him. I need a car. What's this? Oh, $55,000, man. What else is back here? All right. Like,
[2542.79s -> 2554.22s]  give me that car behind that cover. Yes. Nice throw, dude. Okay. That was pretty good though.
[2556.04s -> 2568.66s]  Can I just drive through the wall? This is the most efficient way to mow the lawn.
[2569.46s -> 2586.71s]  Just throw a grenade. All right. Where is he? Right here. Another maze guy. No. Oh, party's over.
[2587.67s -> 2593.80s]  Party's over. Yep. Party's over, guys. Why am I sinking into the ground?
[2598.81s -> 2625.46s]  Where is he? Holy shit. You are horrible. You sucked. Oh, fire. Why is there fire? Let's go.
[2634.57s -> 2642.44s]  Don't shoot that. Don't shoot that. I need that. I need that. Do not. Thank you. Don't blow that up.
[2642.44s -> 2663.27s]  Get out of my way. Get out of my way. I need that. Are you serious? I need this. Not going to work.
[2663.27s -> 2676.26s]  Not going to work. Whatever. Who did he throw that at? They didn't throw it at me.
[2676.90s -> 2711.58s]  Wait, that's money. I need that. Just shoot. What? Give me that money. That's a lot of cash.
[2711.58s -> 2722.74s]  $85,000. Behind the tree. Behind that wall. Behind that car. Behind that thing. Behind that
[2722.74s -> 2751.34s]  structure. Was this two people or is that one person? What? Why are they dead? Okay. Go to the
[2751.34s -> 2764.50s]  front entrance. They can't swim. It's always so funny in games where you can't swim. Where water
[2764.50s -> 2773.86s]  instantly kills you. It doesn't cause any blood. It's like a poison. It's an instant poison.
[2774.66s -> 2784.30s]  It's like getting electrocuted. Water is electricity. Oh my goodness. You dick. I
[2784.30s -> 2791.96s]  needed that. I want your thing. Give me that. Like an acid pool. Yeah. Okay. Wait. RPG. Nice.
[2791.96s -> 2803.67s]  So much fun. Check this out. I can't blow the... I got to go to the front of the... Can I go on
[2803.67s -> 2814.86s]  the side of the building? Wait. That's going to take way too long. Never mind. Is there another
[2814.86s -> 2825.27s]  car I can take? There we go. Yeah. I've got my tried and true. My trusty. Important. This game
[2825.27s -> 2836.55s]  has a manual save. If you die, you go to the beginning. What? Oh my God. Thank you for saying
[2836.55s -> 2857.83s]  that. Why did you tell him that? I'm so glad you did. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't
[2857.83s -> 2877.16s]  shoot. No. The same fate. The same fate as the last one. All right. I made it. Now what?
[2885.56s -> 2891.16s]  Inside the villa. All right. I got one shot. Wait. Can I destroy everything?
[2891.96s -> 2909.69s]  All right. I'm going to destroy the statue of Michelangelo. What's going on? We good?
[2912.41s -> 2921.42s]  Any resistance inside? There's kind of a tank in here. Okay. Get close to the tank turret.
[2923.11s -> 2943.16s]  Hijack the tank. Oh no. Okay. Whoa. Hijack. That was weird. I just kind of fell through the ground.
[2945.59s -> 2958.07s]  Behind that tank. Go to the courtyard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want a motorcycle in here so bad.
[2960.58s -> 2975.16s]  Behind that thing. Behind that building. That does it for the estate ground. I'm seeing some
[2975.16s -> 2982.97s]  activity inside the villa. All right. Hijack the tank. All right. I got $115,000.
[2984.57s -> 2991.05s]  Do you buy new weapons and shit in this game? This is, I'm going to like this. This is going
[2991.05s -> 3004.14s]  to be a lot of fun. Okay. I'm ready. Got it. Is there any resistance inside? There's kind of a
[3004.14s -> 3040.17s]  tank in here. Come back over here. Come here. What is the sound? The music stopped.
[3044.81s -> 3057.56s]  Okay. I just wanted to see what happened. I'll get it instantly. Ready? Count to one. One. I don't
[3057.56s -> 3068.12s]  want to hijack this. I don't think that's what would happen. Destroy the
[3068.12s -> 3093.85s]  entourage. Is the plane part of it? Die. Die. She's the last guy. Right there. All right. So
[3093.85s -> 3109.10s]  do I leave? All right. So we go up the stairs. Destroy the statue. We don't have time. No,
[3109.10s -> 3123.02s]  no, no, no. The statue stays. That was Harry Potter music. Kind of. Yeah.
[3132.86s -> 3138.52s]  Huge oil company. They own all the derricks in the area. By someone named Ruben. Yeah,
[3138.52s -> 3147.61s]  Lorraine Ruben. Do you know where Blanco is? Look at that. She deals with Blanco. And if we find
[3147.61s -> 3156.34s]  Blanco, we find Solano. All right. We got to find Blanco. Is that a casino?
[3165.62s -> 3172.38s]  Uh-oh. Ready to get to work? We can talk about how we make contact with Universal Petroleum.
[3172.38s -> 3176.30s]  Also, it might be a good idea to practice some of your basic combat skills now that
[3176.30s -> 3181.14s]  we have a base of operations. I can help you with both of these. Oh.
[3182.98s -> 3189.96s]  Implaced weapons challenge one. Let's do it. I know you hate target practice, but I know you
[3189.96s -> 3196.12s]  love losing money. I mean gambling. Oh. Not without a friendly wager to your normal routine.
[3196.12s -> 3203.59s]  Okay. That's a magic word. All right. Here's a simple wager between you and me. I've set up
[3203.67s -> 3208.71s]  an emplaced weapons challenge on the PMC grounds. You use the weapons to blow up targets before the
[3208.71s -> 3212.79s]  time runs out and you win. Destroying the cars during the challenge will pause the timer.
[3212.79s -> 3263.88s]  Wager a thousand. Let's go. Where's the last one? Where's the last statue? Where is it?
[3270.14s -> 3278.15s]  All right. Shoot the cars. Move to the recoilless rifles and shoot cars.
[3280.42s -> 3299.90s]  What? Oh, I gotta do it in the air? Shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. God damn it.
[3307.59s -> 3352.26s]  Damn it. What's the travel time on this thing? Shit. Shit. Oh. Now what? He sucks. He does not
[3352.26s -> 3359.86s]  suck. Move to the grenade launchers. I've got two minutes and 48 seconds. All right. Move to...
[3360.50s -> 3388.60s]  What? Where is it? What do I have to destroy? There's nothing else to blow up.
[3402.02s -> 3407.45s]  What? It's a hundred thousand dollars that is made. It's the easiest hundred thousand I've ever made
[3407.45s -> 3413.53s]  in my life. Like that's the easiest hundred K ever. I had a full three minutes. I have to...
[3413.53s -> 3424.14s]  That's like... Come on. Grenade launcher challenge level one.
[3428.50s -> 3437.13s]  Grenade launcher course for you to be. Use the launcher to blow up the targets. You can
[3437.13s -> 3447.48s]  only fire from behind the sandbag. Let's go. He's addicted. All right. Let's go.
[3457.53s -> 3483.78s]  Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload.
[3483.78s -> 3492.39s]  What? Last one, right? All right. Two minutes. I got plenty of time.
[3501.14s -> 3526.94s]  Oh shit. I have one shot left. What? What do I have to do? Destroy statues? What statues?
[3526.94s -> 3553.53s]  Where are they? I don't understand. It's behind them? It's splash damage. Okay. Splash damage.
[3553.53s -> 3564.33s]  Oh shit. There's another one. I did it. That's a hundred fucking thousand more dollars.
[3576.28s -> 3584.36s]  Save the game. Quick. Pistol level one. All right. Hold on. Let me save it.
[3584.92s -> 3600.90s]  So I get like a million dollars? Another one. Stop gambling Gary. All right. I'll do pistol
[3600.90s -> 3614.68s]  challenge and that's it. Pistol course. Shoot down all the Solano portraits with your pistol. Remember
[3614.68s -> 3622.07s]  you can only fire from behind the sandbag. Let's go. Just retire. I haven't even done one mission
[3622.07s -> 3628.54s]  yet. All right. How do I beat this? What does it have to swim underneath this?
[3632.63s -> 3650.36s]  Okay. How do I get up there? Wait. What's going on? Wait. Am I bugged out of the map?
[3654.54s -> 3664.54s]  This is not fair. This is a huge disadvantage. Do I have to swim to the shore? I'm only going
[3664.54s -> 3682.31s]  to have one. All right. Right here. I've got to be quick. I'm swimming further down. I can't shoot
[3682.31s -> 3717.83s]  from here. Medivac. Wait. I lost a hundred and ten thousand. Now that's bullshit. That's
[3717.83s -> 3729.86s]  absolute horse shit. I'm not going to stand for that one. I'm not standing for that one.
[3735.86s -> 3744.09s]  Why am I going so fast? Where's my money? How much money do I have? There we go. All right. Wait.
[3744.09s -> 3755.69s]  This is like a thing. Wait. Can I buy clothes? No outfits found. How do I buy them? All right.
[3755.69s -> 3759.93s]  Is the game running at sixty FPS and the game is not running times two speed? Am I going crazy
[3759.93s -> 3772.60s]  or what happened here? No, I don't care. Let's go. I'm doing the mission now. I got three hundred
[3772.60s -> 3782.78s]  and fifteen thousand universal petroleum. I've done some research on that American oil company
[3782.78s -> 3788.06s]  that Blanco is involved with. They're called universal petroleum. Before Solano took over,
[3788.06s -> 3794.14s]  they had exclusive rights to drill for oil and only gave the Venezuelan hyper fast game even
[3794.14s -> 3803.19s]  faster. Oh, by the way, just to make sure everyone knows August 23rd is the last day
[3803.19s -> 3810.95s]  you can submit for the DLC movie night. And then that stream is going to be on the 29th.
[3810.95s -> 3815.59s]  Solving some problems for UP senior executive here, Dr. Lorraine Rubin,
[3815.59s -> 3822.65s]  should show them how much more useful we can be. So far, there are about four hundred videos.
[3822.65s -> 3829.70s]  So it's going to be wild. It's four hundred of them. We still have to go through the origin,
[3829.70s -> 3836.34s]  the first wave of vetting them, but I have to imagine it's not going to be too far from like
[3836.34s -> 3843.70s]  350, 360 or something. I don't know. Or omega well, omega well. Yeah. All right.
[3845.38s -> 3853.13s]  Steel guns. Return the shipment to the up HQ. Five hundred dollars a gun. That's nothing. I
[3853.13s -> 3864.22s]  could make a hundred thousand dollars in five seconds. Well, this is not looking good.
[3867.43s -> 3876.60s]  Am I just going through the sewers? Am I going to open up underneath this guy's toilet?
[3882.38s -> 3893.86s]  With your PDA, you need to be looking at your PDA to set the GPS.
[3893.86s -> 3896.02s]  Well, I'm having a little bit more trouble, lady.
[3901.32s -> 3923.62s]  No, I'm trying to get back up to the surface. Stop talking to me for a second. OK. Beacon,
[3923.62s -> 3936.02s]  place. Good. Now you can follow the GPS. Thank you. There's got to be a way I can get up here,
[3936.02s -> 3940.14s]  right? It has to. All right. I'm going to go this way. Get away from the house.
[3940.86s -> 3952.57s]  I feel like I can probably swim up that. Am I making any progress? I think so.
[3953.13s -> 3962.17s]  Swim to the bottom of the world. I don't think there's a dive. You have to find a pool and swim
[3962.17s -> 3972.09s]  up. I don't want to do that. Oh, no. Do I have to go find it? Oh, that's not good. Oh, don't give me
[3972.09s -> 3978.73s]  those things to do because I'm going to do them. I actually have to find a pool in the town and
[3978.73s -> 3997.37s]  swim up the pool. Is there a body of water over here? There's a pool in the backyard. There's
[3997.37s -> 4007.83s]  one at the villa. It's too late. OK, there's no more water right here, so it's going to force
[4007.83s -> 4022.22s]  me up onto the land, isn't it? That's false. No, Omega-Lel, no. There's no more water to swim in.
[4022.22s -> 4040.28s]  Wouldn't it just push me up through the earth? No, it'll push you down. Oh, my God. Where's the
[4040.28s -> 4051.06s]  fucking pool? Where is it? Lock your frames? I mean, if the frames are locked at 60, should I
[4051.06s -> 4070.26s]  lock it to 30? Lock it to 30? Oh, but that's ugly. Let me see if I can go up here. Is this the pool
[4070.26s -> 4104.04s]  right here? This looks like water going straight up. I just want to climb up this. OK, I'm almost
[4104.04s -> 4120.65s]  there. All right, now go up. No? Just pull me out. Don't forget to stock up on fuel and support.
[4120.65s -> 4128.10s]  Retry? Yes. All right, come on. Don't drop me in the water again. There we go. All right, we're up.
[4128.10s -> 4136.34s]  We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're good. We're up. Look, I made $300,000.
[4136.34s -> 4144.25s]  It's OK if I lose 10. Steal a truck. Yep. Open that PDA. Set a route. You guys say route or you
[4144.25s -> 4161.90s]  guys say route? What do you guys say? I say route. Thank you. So, what are these two
[4161.90s -> 4172.25s]  whistle things? Go back in the water. You missed a secret. I don't care. All right, I need a
[4172.25s -> 4181.40s]  helicopter pilot to get this stuff. Fine. You call a router a router? No, but if you have a route,
[4181.40s -> 4187.34s]  you have a route. Like, it's either one works. They're both phonetically correct in English.
[4202.55s -> 4216.38s]  NA wording. No, they both work. They're both right. They're both correct. Stop! Are there police in
[4216.38s -> 4238.49s]  this game? I don't think there is. There's no star system, right? Follow that person. No,
[4238.49s -> 4249.50s]  I want to do the mission. Whatever. I want the bike, but I can't get the bike. You know what I
[4249.50s -> 4256.78s]  mean? You're a maniac. I'm so glad there are bikes. I can't wait to go off a sick jump.
[4256.78s -> 4279.59s]  They spawned in. That's not my fault. Like a glove. I just bumped him. He's all right.
[4282.22s -> 4287.18s]  Give me that. I want a motorcycle. There's so much fun. I love driving around in like GTA
[4287.18s -> 4292.23s]  type games with motorcycles. I'm going to get it. Oh, are you still on it?
[4309.18s -> 4327.29s]  I love it. You can just go up on one wheel. Ow. Right up here. And then I do have to steal the truck.
[4327.29s -> 4355.62s]  Right. Okay. Give me the truck. Not the right truck. Can you get in the canoe? Cargo value.
[4355.62s -> 4386.97s]  All right. All right. I need to go up here. Harry Potter. Stop. Don't bang up the truck. MCU music.
[4399.37s -> 4403.21s]  Why did he do that? He was trying to flip me.
[4403.85s -> 4419.99s]  I'm not going to have anything left. 1.5 thousand. Are you shitting me?
[4439.19s -> 4444.15s]  Okay. Need at least $500 of cargo. Let's go. I got it. I got it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[4444.15s -> 4451.24s]  This is fun. This is fun. He's going to keep the shit in the back. Oh, this is a cool car.
[4451.24s -> 4471.27s]  That hurt me. This is a fucking Cadillac. All right. Not going to mess it up. So I'm
[4471.27s -> 4486.60s]  going to try to get as many as I can. Like I can pull it off with like movie wire.
[4487.40s -> 4504.81s]  That was a matrix scene. What happened? I know. I look, I did it already. I'm already a full step
[4504.81s -> 4518.06s]  ahead of you. Dammit. I was trying to hit the guy in the head. I will get like a headshot with
[4518.06s -> 4531.70s]  a bike. I promise you at least once. All right. Cargo. All right. Let's be easy. I'm going to try
[4531.70s -> 4542.44s]  to get as much as I can here. Why would they just be loose in the back? You can't wrap these up
[4542.44s -> 4554.81s]  like Saran wrap or something. Where's the bungees to hold these things down? Put a tarp on it. Yeah.
[4554.81s -> 4560.31s]  That's what I mean. Like tie a tarp down behind here. All this loose shit. You never should
[4560.31s -> 4566.92s]  carry anything like this. But you always drive by that guy in the highway that's got like a
[4566.92s -> 4572.92s]  fucking mattress with one bungee on there. And he's going like 40 miles, like 30 miles per hour
[4572.92s -> 4577.08s]  in the highway. It's like, dude, you can't take a back road. Like what the fuck are you doing?
[4582.95s -> 4591.78s]  How much is in there? There's still $500. Push it. Can't move.
[4605.77s -> 4606.41s]  God damn it.
[4617.85s -> 4623.21s]  All right. Well, it's this guy. This is a deliberate sabotage guy drives across the whole thing.
[4623.21s -> 4627.45s]  And he tries to, he just murders you, just drives into you from the side.
[4635.96s -> 4642.60s]  How does it feel to get sabotaged? I feel like that happens quite frequently.
[4651.83s -> 4687.80s]  I want to go the other direction. Okay. Here we go. Oh, go, go, go. Okay. Do not let the guy
[4687.80s -> 4704.15s]  in the Mack truck smash into the side of the car. I gotta be the guy in the highway going 30
[4704.87s -> 4719.24s]  out of the way. All right. When does it happen? And he comes right from the left side.
[4719.96s -> 4728.87s]  Truck joke incoming. No truck joke, not incoming. This is where truck joke truck. I can't even say
[4729.67s -> 4737.56s]  here it comes right here. He drives over here. What was that? Did I go over a bump? There it is.
[4737.56s -> 4739.80s]  All right. He's waiting. He's waiting. He's waiting. This is like an online player.
[4739.80s -> 4752.07s]  Fuck you, buddy. Not going to happen. Yup. See you later. Watch out for grenades. Now I've got to
[4752.07s -> 4754.95s]  hold on. I got to take an alternate route. I don't want to go straight up the front.
[4755.75s -> 4761.56s]  All right. We're going to go this way. We're going to turn good. Okay. Now we're going to bang left.
[4767.05s -> 4794.14s]  We're going to, we're avoiding that huge barricade. Is that water? Okay. All right. Hey,
[4794.86s -> 4811.22s]  okay. We're good. I did it. I got $9,000. One of the guns spawned outside the truck.
[4812.18s -> 4822.01s]  That's unfortunate. Sneak through here. It's okay. It's all right. How do I have 31 health?
[4824.76s -> 4849.26s]  Okay. Here it is. $9,000. Exit the vehicle. Thank you. Return guns to contract me bonus. $9,000,
[4849.26s -> 4865.24s]  $9,000. I think it's shooting at me. Didn't I just do a mission for them?
[4865.56s -> 4871.30s]  Is the head Ruben in there? Didn't I just do this with these guys?
[4872.10s -> 4883.02s]  Why are they doing this? I'm a dipshit. I was, they were just lighting me up.
[4889.69s -> 4896.20s]  Wait, I shot at the truck. Yeah. And the cut scene, that doesn't count.
[4897.08s -> 4901.82s]  I found your missing guns. Now I'd like to talk to Dr. Ruben.
[4901.82s -> 4908.12s]  The name's Mui. Your boss wants to speak to me. All right. You're the mercilano shot in the ass.
[4908.12s -> 4917.22s]  Hey, you know what she's got? Tim times gave $50. Thank you, Tim times. That's a huge amount of money.
[4919.14s -> 4925.43s]  Say thanks for all the laughs. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. Dude. I'm listening.
[4925.43s -> 4929.83s]  We need you to retrieve. That's fucking crazy. Classified tech. Can't say much.
[4934.81s -> 4942.78s]  Loving every laugh. Laughing about it. Okay. Action up. The up mercs want a favor before opening the
[4942.78s -> 4953.30s]  gate. Retrieve their one of a kind vehicle. The Devastator. 25,000. Let's do it. Am I going to
[4953.30s -> 4977.43s]  have aggro on these guys for the rest of the game? Shit. Okay. Well, it's just the guys outside,
[4977.43s -> 4988.54s]  right? It's just the guys outside. We're fine. They're not firing. Yeah. They just, they just,
[4988.54s -> 5003.83s]  they're just angry. All right. Who do I have to talk to? So I don't have to be here.
[5021.99s -> 5039.50s]  Where is it? That's it. It's X to reverse. That's me.
[5042.81s -> 5072.47s]  I'm so excited. What? I need to reload. You have got to be kidding me.
[5076.97s -> 5090.52s]  This isn't funny. This is the Devastator. Okay. You're my hero. So I have to take this fucking thing?
[5091.32s -> 5104.89s]  Where? This is 25 grand. That means you have to ride the little pink bike.
[5105.45s -> 5119.26s]  Get out of here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Laugh it up. Nice bike. Huh? None of you
[5119.26s -> 5127.99s]  dickheads could do what I just did. Everybody just shut their fucking mouth immediately after
[5127.99s -> 5139.38s]  seeing that. So this is just like, haha, you have to go get this dumb, embarrassing bike.
[5140.10s -> 5171.56s]  You're doing, I have it. It's okay. Let's move please.
[5171.56s -> 5197.40s]  $25,000. One of them is, you know, can I just kill one of them? Don't shoot them. Don't shoot
[5197.40s -> 5204.90s]  them. Don't shoot anybody. Oh wait, I can go in here. Do not attack anybody in here is what you're
[5204.90s -> 5237.93s]  saying. Don't do that. Wait. Enemies sighted. I'm sorry. I mean, you got the enemies here.
[5238.73s -> 5244.74s]  She's in the car. What are you doing? Why did he just do that? Why did he just do that?
[5246.78s -> 5268.90s]  Why did he just do that? You psycho. Oh, he's too smart. He got out. Yeah, he did get out. Outplayed.
[5277.29s -> 5281.61s]  I can't help it. I love these games. This is so much fun. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I have
[5281.61s -> 5292.15s]  to go. Ow. What's the X? What's that mean? X, X, X, like a bar filling. What does that mean?
[5293.11s -> 5319.66s]  Skies as a voice suspicion to keep your disguise up. Open up. All right. I'm going to save, save,
[5319.66s -> 5326.18s]  save. Oh, shit. You're being completely unreasonable. There's over 2000 people here.
[5326.18s -> 5330.58s]  How can we possibly get this? All right. There's almost 7000 people here. You got it a little wrong.
[5330.58s -> 5336.10s]  You got the most expensive haircut here. You must be in charge. You're the
[5336.10s -> 5341.30s]  mercenary my security people call me about. My name's Marie. Well, I'm glad you're here.
[5342.18s -> 5347.62s]  This presents a fantastic opportunity. Why are these not right? Universal petroleum. Sure.
[5347.62s -> 5351.94s]  I'm Dr. Ruben. What a little costume. Anything you need, I can provide. I'm here with only one
[5351.94s -> 5357.22s]  instruction. Keep the oil flowing. I'm empowered to use any of the all methods. You met with someone
[5357.22s -> 5363.06s]  I'm looking for. A former mercenary. They call Blanco. I'm familiar with him. When Solano has
[5363.06s -> 5371.48s]  bad news for us, he sends Blanco. This is really bad stage production. I just memorized my fucking
[5371.48s -> 5377.40s]  lines and I'm just going to say them. Hopefully you get yours right too. Let's hear it. Arrested
[5377.40s -> 5382.84s]  strategy of corporate disincentivization. His men kidnapped my marketing VP, Victor Contreras,
[5382.84s -> 5386.92s]  and are threatening to kill him. I don't think Solano's men are particularly bright. They call
[5386.92s -> 5392.04s]  me regularly from Victor's cell phone. I'm going to loan you my helicopter. Damn it.
[5395.56s -> 5396.92s]  It even has Sims music.
[5408.63s -> 5410.63s]  I can't follow any of that. I have no idea what just happened.
[5412.31s -> 5417.48s]  Um, okay. These ethugs have kidnapped a universal petroleum executive.
[5418.63s -> 5423.91s]  Use the provided helicopter to support, to deliver listening posts and then we can track the
[5423.91s -> 5437.66s]  kidnappers. Oh yeah. Then rescue the hostage $500,000. Is he pretending about the FPS? No,
[5437.66s -> 5443.00s]  I liked it. I don't want it to be 30. I, it's fine.
[5454.14s -> 5459.48s]  The first thing you'll have to do is set up three, set up listening posts.
[5462.36s -> 5465.08s]  I've identified the best places for the listening posts.
[5467.77s -> 5470.65s]  Okay. Deliver listening posts. We're going this way first.
[5471.85s -> 5479.14s]  Holy shit. Something just exploded. Save game. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[5484.31s -> 5489.75s]  Increase the FPS. Universal petroleum helipilot in the air and ready for your signal.
[5489.75s -> 5492.71s]  This is going to get hairy Devlin. You ready to dodge air fire?
[5495.59s -> 5498.95s]  Holy shit. The helicopters just flew into each other. What the hell is going on up there?
[5498.95s -> 5500.71s]  Did you see that? Wait a minute.
[5518.26s -> 5521.54s]  An alarm has activated. Give me a break. Blaster bomb.
[5526.79s -> 5554.50s]  Ow, my head. Okay. I'm going in. What I have to do, listening posts, listening post delivery.
[5554.50s -> 5564.78s]  Right here. Get in the X wing.
[5567.96s -> 5573.98s]  One of the most satisfying noises in all cinema history is the quack, quack.
[5574.78s -> 5612.07s]  Fucking landed on my feet too. Jesus. Where is it? I know I was going on the roof,
[5612.07s -> 5623.26s]  but then they blasted me off. What happened to it? It's gone. What? I'm so confused. Why is it gone?
[5633.02s -> 5652.06s]  Good. Good, good, good. All right. I'm almost there. What? He's looking over there like,
[5652.06s -> 5658.22s]  oh no. Oh shit. Oh, that's not good. It's not good. Oh, it's okay.
[5659.10s -> 5675.00s]  Listening port. Hello. Let's do it. No shit. Did I do the wrong spot?
[5678.42s -> 5702.65s]  Switch secondary weapon C4. What is this? All right. Did I turn it on? Do I need that?
[5703.21s -> 5713.88s]  Do I need that? Somebody tell me. Do I need that thing? Yes, I do. Is it fall damage?
[5714.68s -> 5722.18s]  Is it fall damage? Yes or no? Fall damage? I need that. It's on the other side of the
[5722.18s -> 5750.41s]  fence. Fuck. I got him. Buster bomb. What do I do with it? How do I use it? What? What did I just do?
[5751.29s -> 5780.44s]  Wait, what? Where's the C4 that I threw? It's somewhere over here. I think it exploded.
[5780.44s -> 5784.60s]  It doesn't matter. I don't even need it. Oh my God. Just go, go, go, go, go. Get in, get in,
[5784.60s -> 5806.60s]  get in, get in. Good drive. Okay, Ren. Stevie, I'm going to kill you. Switch secondary weapons
[5806.60s -> 5813.02s]  to equip C4. That's going to be on the screen forever, I think. How do I get that off the screen?
[5813.82s -> 5830.23s]  How do I get out of here? Equip it? I don't know how to equip it. Switch secondary weapons to equip
[5830.23s -> 5840.82s]  C4. But I already, I equipped the C4 and I threw it over the cliff. What's going on with this
[5840.82s -> 5879.72s]  helicopter? Grapple. How do I grapple? I need a grappling hook. What? Right back up. What the
[5879.72s -> 5891.66s]  hell are you talking about? Whoa, what's this? Collect spare parts. That's $200,000 but no reason.
[5892.38s -> 5916.06s]  All right, here we go. Right on the beach. It's listening post two. Increase the FPS. I can't.
[5916.94s -> 5937.32s]  There's no increasing FPS. Get a guy on the turret. Will he get on? Okay, there's one right there.
[5937.32s -> 5944.66s]  Just take it. I gave you that one. Take that one. All right, make sure your aim is good.
[5950.31s -> 5955.06s]  You're just shooting up into... All right, well, I didn't even know. I think you aggroed those guys.
[5955.70s -> 5983.62s]  Money. No, I don't want it. I can't even take it. Come on in. Get it. Get him. Shoot, shoot, shoot,
[5983.62s -> 5991.62s]  shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Shoot him. Shoot him down, please.
[5993.08s -> 6009.96s]  Shoot him down. Get him. Enemy tank? Oh, you got him. You got him. Good, good, good.
[6010.68s -> 6055.85s]  Shoot that tank. Steal it. Steal it. Get him. Did he have a ball gag in his mouth? What was that?
[6057.02s -> 6074.18s]  What was in his mouth? What the hell was that? Wait, I think I... The whole building just came
[6074.18s -> 6085.99s]  down. Oh, shit. Okay, I'm ready. Use... Listening. Listening. Grenade. Active.
[6095.26s -> 6106.98s]  This game is literally times two speed. Is it? Is it really though? Like, is it actually?
[6117.72s -> 6129.88s]  I can't... I cannot change this. This is not changeable. All right, one more.
[6129.88s -> 6149.40s]  I'm blowing this place up. Look, it's a red thing. How could there be two of you in here?
[6151.58s -> 6158.52s]  How many people are in there with a rocket launcher? Why does every window have a guy
[6158.52s -> 6198.89s]  with a rocket launcher in it? Turn on V-sync. Change their voices. No, it's the same, right?
[6199.85s -> 6224.31s]  Yeah, it's the same. I have a deadline. Move. Like, I'm just complaining about the humidity.
[6224.95s -> 6236.62s]  Now it looks like it has a Snapchat filter on it. It's... Now it's worse. Hold on. Wait, is it worse?
[6237.42s -> 6254.81s]  I can't change the refresh rate. It won't let me. Put it on four three. Why would I make it four
[6254.81s -> 6268.70s]  three? Don't stand in the road, dude. Don't shoot at me. Going to advanced. I don't think I can
[6268.70s -> 6275.30s]  change this, guys. Advanced. Water effects. Particle level. Motion. Yeah, none of this
[6275.30s -> 6293.66s]  means anything. Please add me back on Snapchat. No. All right, here we go.
[6295.45s -> 6300.28s]  V-sync is off again. Yeah, because everyone hated it. All right, this one should be easy.
[6313.48s -> 6331.21s]  Oh, give me that tank. Three out of three. I got it. Okay. Yeah, I'm destroying this building.
[6331.85s -> 6334.73s]  This is the guys with the rocket launchers hang out in here. What's in there?
[6337.85s -> 6345.70s]  Okay. Building destroyed. Wait, what's all this blinking for?
[6354.38s -> 6355.66s]  Rocket launcher storage.
[6365.80s -> 6376.06s]  What? Kill the executive? No, no, go. Hijack kidnapper's vehicle and save the...
[6376.06s -> 6385.40s]  Shoot the... I'm not going to shoot the old lady. Stop.
[6392.65s -> 6405.29s]  Oh, that's a good guy. Wait. What's a 200 fucking thousand dollars?
[6406.73s -> 6438.41s]  All right, give me a faster car. I need a bike. Just give me the sedan. Bootleg Star Wars. It is
[6438.49s -> 6441.53s]  kind of like Star Wars. All right, I only have 11 minutes before this is all done.
[6450.86s -> 6457.34s]  I love the... Who's in that vehicle? Oh, it's one of ours. Why would they care? They have to check
[6457.34s -> 6462.18s]  every single car to see if it's one of their friends. Good link. All right, hold on. Wait,
[6462.18s -> 6473.75s]  wait, wait, wait. Well, here's the problem. I can't click on the link yet because alt-tabbing
[6473.75s -> 6476.63s]  freezes the game. So we have to wait till I get to... Wait, I have to steal this or what?
[6477.43s -> 6487.40s]  It'll only be hijacked from the rear. So what, am I supposed to drive up behind and jump out of the
[6487.40s -> 6517.24s]  car or just wedge him? Check the link. I can't right now. I cannot click a link right now. If
[6517.24s -> 6525.42s]  I alt-tab, the game will crash. You're going to have to wait until I'm done with this mission.
[6537.96s -> 6553.06s]  Don't drive into me. This is an armored car. Get out of the way. You're driving on the wrong side.
[6553.06s -> 6558.17s]  Yeah, I do that in every driving game because it's quicker. You actually get to where you're
[6558.17s -> 6565.70s]  going way faster. And why is the GPS set incorrectly, by the way? Who put that in?
[6567.19s -> 6570.79s]  Oh, I just kind of wanted to get you close. Get me close. What do you think I could do?
[6570.79s -> 6573.27s]  You don't have confidence I can't get you where you're fucking going?
[6594.58s -> 6603.10s]  All right, quick, get him. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy.
[6603.90s -> 6619.77s]  Can I actually... What? Can I fly this? Oh, just a... This is huge. Where are we going?
[6620.49s -> 6644.94s]  Who's landing zone? Um, that's dumb. That's dumb. I want to... Why can't I fly it?
[6648.54s -> 6658.01s]  Okay, come in. I got to spend this money. I have like a million dollars.
[6668.44s -> 6669.24s]  How does this guy get in?
[6678.28s -> 6680.92s]  Holding a match in his mouth. He's like smoking a match.
[6691.88s -> 6695.72s]  Like this dude is... What are you? What are you? Like 15, you go to the gas station, you
[6695.72s -> 6699.88s]  buy... You just take like the matches and you pretend to smoke the matches. What are you
[6699.88s -> 6703.62s]  trying to be cool? I don't get it. Is that the only thing you can get from the store?
[6703.62s -> 6711.64s]  What happened? Wait, did this...
[6716.44s -> 6717.64s]  We just saw this again.
[6729.48s -> 6731.64s]  Wake up! Wake up!
[6733.80s -> 6740.92s]  Okay, here he is. We got him. Good.
[6747.75s -> 6756.34s]  Is this changing? Skip! Jesus. New shop item. Top supply drop.
[6759.90s -> 6771.22s]  CQB kit. All right, save game. All right, click on the link now. Let's take a look.
[6771.78s -> 6788.81s]  What is it? What do you want me to see? Why is everybody spamming? Wait, what is this?
[6791.78s -> 6796.82s]  Wait, is this somebody like... Are you like watching a presentation in like college?
[6813.59s -> 6827.29s]  What? Wait, hold on. Why are you doing this? Go back to school. Show it. It's a Twitter video.
[6827.29s -> 6836.82s]  I can't... Hold on. All right. No, I had... No, no, no, no. This is cute, but like... No,
[6836.82s -> 6843.51s]  I don't... That's... I don't want to... No, no, no, no. You go look at it. My game is about to
[6843.51s -> 6851.91s]  actually freeze. I asked the professor a question. Well, I didn't. You're doing an illegal move in
[6851.91s -> 6879.77s]  college. I think it's broken. Are we in? All right, I'm good. I can't stay tabbed out for too long.
[6879.77s -> 6885.48s]  He's gonna get disqualified from class. You should be doing your homework and not watching
[6885.48s -> 6903.38s]  this shitty stream. True. Don't even say that out loud. All right. What about... What about
[6903.38s -> 6910.95s]  winching? What about a star system? Well, it's a good ques... Wait, get the toolbox above the
[6910.95s -> 6929.34s]  specified height and you'll win the wager. Am I gonna be too short for this? I let the trans...
[6930.97s -> 6942.26s]  Um, okay. What the hell was that? You can fly it? Play and retract the winch. You can fly
[6942.26s -> 6953.98s]  helicopters. Okay, how do we fly this? How do I deploy it? Up, down? Okay, it's left.
[6954.62s -> 6976.33s]  What am I trying to do? Am I picking up the tree? I got it. Okay, now where am I taking this? What
[6976.33s -> 6980.84s]  do I... What am I taking this? Out of bounds! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you want me to do?
[6985.37s -> 7023.98s]  What? Target five. Do I just let it go? Did I do it? Hold it at five. Okay, hold it at five. Okay,
[7024.06s -> 7073.56s]  now what? Stack it. Stack it? Stack crates. I dropped it. Okay, it's off, right? Drop it. All
[7073.56s -> 7111.22s]  right, go. Why is this one heavier? Okay, what? All right, I got it. I did it. Is that nine meters?
[7111.22s -> 7145.98s]  What's the goal? Too much? The target is five. Yeah, but I can't go over the target? Okay, two,
[7145.98s -> 7158.30s]  five. Okay, nine, seven, six. Is that it? It's six. Oh, come on, really? I did it. What are you guys
[7158.30s -> 7180.10s]  talking about? I did, I won. 1.4 million. Level two, transit. No, no, information about Eva.
[7189.06s -> 7194.01s]  Okay.
[7208.07s -> 7219.14s]  Can we get rid of this guy? All right, pistol challenge. Introduction to the Plav sniping
[7219.14s -> 7232.44s]  challenge. All right, one more. I've set up a sniper course. Destroy the portraits of Solano
[7232.44s -> 7243.08s]  and destroy Solano's cars. You have to stay on the roof. Okay.
[7254.33s -> 7273.66s]  How do I zoom in? How do I aim? How do I go into sniper mode? Okay, I got bonus objective updated.
[7273.66s -> 7291.99s]  Destroy the bonus statue. What? Wait, am I in like a... I'm like stuck in here. That didn't get
[7291.99s -> 7324.23s]  destroyed. I think it's still possible. Ice cream truck. I can't even shoot these ones. This is so
[7324.23s -> 7338.60s]  fucked up. What the hell? I didn't even save the game before this either. I'm loaded inside of the
[7338.60s -> 7361.77s]  wall. I get it. Okay. Maybe I could have jumped up here and... That's so stupid.
[7363.62s -> 7368.82s]  Whatever. It's 100k. I have 1.3 million. All right, I'm just doing introduction to the Plav.
[7369.22s -> 7374.28s]  I've got some information on the local corruption. The People's Liberation Army of Venezuela,
[7374.28s -> 7380.44s]  or PLAV, is a group of leftist radicals. Very radical. They've been hiding out in the
[7380.44s -> 7385.88s]  jungle for decades. They hate Solano enough to risk direct... What's that laughing face?
[7385.88s -> 7389.96s]  They're also keen on disrupting Universal Petroleum's business for being
[7390.52s -> 7396.60s]  willing pawns of the capitalist military... See that? What was that? Whose emote is that?
[7396.60s -> 7402.33s]  Bella Acosta. She's unusually well-funded, thanks to close ties with the People's Republic of China.
[7402.97s -> 7404.25s]  She's willing to spend some of their money on world-class mercenaries...
[7404.25s -> 7415.56s]  It was a laughing face. Yes, that one. What is that? Who is that? All right, I'm ready.
[7421.18s -> 7427.10s]  Where do I buy things? We could probably go public. Get investors, silk stocks. What do you think?
[7427.90s -> 7430.70s]  Um, I want to buy something. I have a lot of money.
[7431.50s -> 7442.04s]  3D streamer refuses to advertise other streamers' emotes.
[7443.00s -> 7452.74s]  Okay, what is going on here? Destroy targets? This is Eva's Garage and then
[7452.74s -> 7460.86s]  Southeastern Amazon Outpost. All right, we're gonna go to Eva's Garage. This is very far away.
[7460.86s -> 7469.54s]  Yeah, where are the clothes? I want to put on something cool. I want to wear a different
[7470.18s -> 7490.98s]  vest or something. Call a helicopter? Transit. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, yeah, I get it.
[7492.20s -> 7506.36s]  You have to get... It's gas. Do I need to get gas? Easy. Nice. Okay, there we go. All right,
[7506.36s -> 7531.29s]  I want to go to Eva's Garage. Why can't you go there? Wait, it has to be another helipad
[7531.29s -> 7560.50s]  that I've already unlocked. Yeah, he gets the picture. Kill him and take it. I don't think I
[7560.50s -> 7592.57s]  can. Oh, that's where the fuel tanks and money too, right? What do you say? All right, here we go.
[7592.57s -> 7596.31s]  Wait, is this bad guys or good guys? Good guys. Nice. All right, these guys are friendly.
[7598.54s -> 7606.02s]  Come get this. Resource pickup. Right here.
[7606.26s -> 7613.85s]  Solano makes us an offer. Oh, sorry, lady. Universal Petroleum can kiss my ass. I don't care
[7613.85s -> 7626.89s]  about the oil, just the paycheck. When do we get it? It's very quiet.
[7640.26s -> 7644.74s]  Good to see one of us made it big. Hold your fire. It's Jennifer Mui. Resource pickup.
[7644.74s -> 7684.65s]  Okay, get it. What? What happened? You're my hero. What happened? Why do they hate me?
[7690.57s -> 7709.42s]  Oh, okay. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I need to redo it. I stole the oil. Holy shit,
[7709.42s -> 7745.59s]  this guy doesn't even care. Wow. I got to track this guy down. Holy shit, he's just going nuts.
[7745.59s -> 7754.94s]  He's just, he's not stopping. What am I doing? What am I doing? You're right.
[7770.73s -> 7787.29s]  This is such a long ride. Wait, does the UP organization hate me now? I didn't even do
[7787.29s -> 7803.62s]  that. I just, I don't, whatever. Why would you do that? What's with these planes flying around?
[7804.26s -> 7814.74s]  There's red planes that keep showing up on the mini-map. Why can't go up that?
[7815.62s -> 7820.18s]  How's that? Oh, okay. I was going to say that makes no sense. Trying to shave some time off.
[7829.18s -> 7845.11s]  Wait, do people know who I am? I guess they kind of do, huh?
[7846.98s -> 7865.29s]  I'm kind of going too fast to be identified, aren't I? Oh, I made it. I actually went through it.
[7865.29s -> 7911.50s]  Okay, so far so good. I got 25 bucks. What'd I get $25 for? It's a guy in the driver's side.
[7916.12s -> 7936.31s]  Okay, let's go. Yeah, this is a shitty gun. I want a new gun. I don't want just like an AK.
[7936.31s -> 7950.09s]  I want something else. Wait, I can take that, right? Can I? Or am I too far away? Can he
[7950.09s -> 7985.59s]  actually get this? Steel tank buster. Yeah. Hello? Wait, somebody's shooting. Get on it.
[7988.01s -> 7997.34s]  Wait, you mean like stand on that? Oh shit, can I do that? I'll try that next time. I'm just going
[7997.34s -> 8004.73s]  to crouch on it and see what happens. Let me go to the mission first. Am I going to play Ratatouille
[8004.73s -> 8015.58s]  for the Xbox 360? No, I don't think so. I'm sorry. Why? Play Jump King? I'm not going to play Jump
[8015.58s -> 8031.26s]  King. I promised. When did I promise that I was going to play Ratatouille? Did I? I don't know
[8031.26s -> 8051.05s]  why I would ever say that. Money. Is this doing anything? I don't know. Was that a grenade or
[8051.05s -> 8061.64s]  is that him coming to get this? Okay. This is the best game. Wait, that's the best game ever made.
[8061.64s -> 8070.82s]  Wait. I forgot. There's another one right here. Don't worry. Ewan stops up. Ewan, come back.
[8071.46s -> 8084.71s]  He's busy. I know. Come on. Hurry up. Get rid of it so I can do this.
[8085.45s -> 8106.01s]  Save the game. Yeah, that's a good call. You promised you'd play it in 2012. What? Do it.
[8106.73s -> 8135.21s]  Did I get the money? The guy drove over it. Come on. Give me a break. Remember when you said you
[8135.21s -> 8140.33s]  were going to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid to us? You had a dream about that. That's not what happened.
[8149.37s -> 8157.66s]  Here we go. Mission time. Read it? I'm not going to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
[8158.06s -> 8164.74s]  You, Ava Navarro? I know who you are. What is?
[8164.74s -> 8167.70s]  You're the mercenary. The one Solano shot in the ass.
[8167.70s -> 8169.78s]  Solano's goon shot me. I figured you'd come here.
[8169.78s -> 8172.98s]  What do you mean you figured I'd come here? You're alone. You need help.
[8172.98s -> 8176.58s]  You go through vehicles quick. Need them repaired. I'm the best-
[8176.58s -> 8180.42s]  So this is the- You hate Carmona.
[8180.42s -> 8182.34s]  You hate Solano. You probably need a helicopter pilot.
[8182.34s -> 8185.78s]  I've got a helicopter pilot. What do you have against Carmona?
[8185.78s -> 8187.94s]  If you're planning on using airstrikes. I am.
[8187.94s -> 8190.82s]  Which I figure you are. All right, so you've got a thing against Carmona.
[8192.50s -> 8197.30s]  No, just because I'm anti-Carmona doesn't mean I'm pro-mercenary.
[8197.30s -> 8200.74s]  All right, you're available. Otherwise, you'd have kicked me out already.
[8200.74s -> 8202.82s]  How did you know? What is that going around to?
[8202.82s -> 8207.46s]  All right, let's see. There's one last job I must finish before I can close up and help you get-
[8207.46s -> 8209.94s]  I'm Solano. Yeah, I'm building a unique vehicle
[8209.94s -> 8214.26s]  for a special client. I need help getting the parts and then when it's done-
[8214.26s -> 8217.30s]  It's funny each time. It's funny every time.
[8217.30s -> 8220.82s]  And the oil company have a bouncer on me. You don't have a lot of friends, do you?
[8220.90s -> 8223.86s]  And I heard something about a jet pilot hiding out with a pirate.
[8223.86s -> 8226.50s]  And when this is done, you'll join me? Probably.
[8227.72s -> 8232.28s]  Okay, test drive the Acharo de Muerte for Eva.
[8233.08s -> 8234.60s]  You remind me of me.
[8234.60s -> 8241.10s]  Oh, the PC version is fucked. Yeah, that's why I got the PlayStation 3 version and I couldn't
[8241.90s -> 8243.98s]  capture it. I don't know why for no reason.
[8243.98s -> 8245.66s]  Okay, test drive.
[8245.66s -> 8247.82s]  Hop in and take her out for a test run for me.
[8247.82s -> 8249.50s]  Why aren't you driving it?
[8250.46s -> 8252.06s]  Oh, this is a comedy car. I can't wait.
[8260.74s -> 8261.54s]  Is this a tuber car?
[8266.17s -> 8267.05s]  Are you telling me it's a jump?
[8268.57s -> 8272.26s]  Is this a jump?
[8273.06s -> 8273.62s]  It better be.
[8277.19s -> 8279.51s]  You know what kind of car? Okay, I had one of these.
[8279.51s -> 8283.67s]  I had a car like this where I could flip it over and it would still drive.
[8284.63s -> 8288.33s]  I'd be driving around and they would just flip the fuck over
[8288.33s -> 8291.29s]  and I would I could still drive it upside down and right side up.
[8292.17s -> 8292.89s]  It was awesome.
[8293.61s -> 8298.47s]  I would drive it this shit over fucking like Clebson.
[8299.19s -> 8300.81s]  I would drive it all over the place.
[8300.81s -> 8302.41s]  I'd gone off on the grass and stuff.
[8302.41s -> 8303.53s]  It was awesome.
[8303.53s -> 8304.41s]  It was so much fun.
[8307.53s -> 8309.29s]  No, not a regular car.
[8309.29s -> 8311.37s]  A like an RC car.
[8311.37s -> 8311.87s]  Yeah.
[8319.11s -> 8319.91s]  What was that thing called?
[8319.91s -> 8321.67s]  It was called like the Reverso or something.
[8322.23s -> 8324.39s]  Right at the strip line.
[8327.56s -> 8328.68s]  It was fast, too.
[8334.42s -> 8336.34s]  I can't believe this is an actual jump.
[8342.63s -> 8343.11s]  Rebound.
[8343.11s -> 8343.67s]  That's the one.
[8343.67s -> 8344.17s]  Yep.
[8344.63s -> 8345.51s]  That thing was awesome.
[8355.69s -> 8356.19s]  Works.
[8360.39s -> 8360.63s]  All right.
[8360.63s -> 8361.19s]  Rough terrain.
[8361.19s -> 8361.69s]  Let's see.
[8371.66s -> 8372.16s]  Crackdown?
[8373.26s -> 8377.67s]  Too bad that crackdown three was terrible.
[8377.67s -> 8378.17s]  All right.
[8378.63s -> 8390.51s]  We're good.
[8391.21s -> 8396.30s]  Crackdown three was destined to be awful.
[8397.18s -> 8400.01s]  I don't even remember crackdown two.
[8400.81s -> 8403.27s]  I remember crackdown one.
[8404.07s -> 8408.46s]  I never played it.
[8411.19s -> 8413.67s]  Two was the same mission 12 times.
[8413.67s -> 8414.55s]  That's unfortunate.
[8415.27s -> 8423.10s]  Crackdown two was just crackdown one with zombies.
[8423.66s -> 8425.78s]  Well, they went with that trope, huh?
[8428.63s -> 8430.62s]  Oh, I have to hit this.
[8430.62s -> 8432.06s]  I'm not just going to drive it.
[8432.06s -> 8433.66s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[8434.54s -> 8438.86s]  What is it specifically about this game that is fun?
[8441.02s -> 8443.00s]  The whole thing.
[8443.72s -> 8444.92s]  I think it's really fun.
[8448.65s -> 8450.17s]  Oh, I have 25 seconds.
[8450.73s -> 8459.91s]  I'm almost there.
[8459.91s -> 8460.47s]  I'm almost there.
[8461.11s -> 8463.80s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[8463.80s -> 8464.30s]  No.
[8470.38s -> 8473.18s]  It's proof of you saying I was going to play Ratatouille.
[8482.18s -> 8482.68s]  All right.
[8483.22s -> 8487.35s]  You know, in my, in my defense, who cares?
[8496.81s -> 8497.45s]  I do.
[8497.45s -> 8500.65s]  Yeah, but like in my defense, it's Ratatouille the game.
[8502.26s -> 8504.90s]  Oh, who, who does it really matter if I played or not?
[8505.54s -> 8511.18s]  I mean, I'm going to on September fucking like 28th or something.
[8511.18s -> 8511.50s]  I don't know.
[8512.30s -> 8520.82s]  He's doing the same joke again.
[8522.50s -> 8524.34s]  You figured me out.
[8524.34s -> 8535.62s]  You figured out everything I do with a jump.
[8536.18s -> 8540.58s]  This is a long mission.
[8541.30s -> 8544.63s]  This is I guess your hydraulics work.
[8544.63s -> 8546.63s]  Can I go back to driving a motorcycle?
[8556.30s -> 8557.82s]  I quit after this mission.
[8558.62s -> 8560.06s]  That's not going to be me.
[8561.02s -> 8564.66s]  I want to fly the helicopter.
[8564.66s -> 8565.86s]  I want to fly the helicopter.
[8570.01s -> 8572.73s]  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[8573.93s -> 8578.63s]  Please, no, why?
[8578.63s -> 8579.67s]  I don't want to do this again.
[8579.67s -> 8580.71s]  I don't want to do this again.
[8589.06s -> 8597.26s]  Oh, my fucking God quit after this mission.
[8597.26s -> 8598.46s]  No, it's not going to happen to me.
[8599.98s -> 8600.46s]  No, it's not.
[8600.46s -> 8600.62s]  Okay.
[8600.62s -> 8602.46s]  I'm just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[8614.25s -> 8614.57s]  Next?
[8614.57s -> 8615.69s]  No, but next.
[8615.69s -> 8616.19s]  What?
[8616.81s -> 8618.41s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8618.41s -> 8619.29s]  No, no, just hold on.
[8620.09s -> 8632.02s]  No, I'm staying here.
[8632.02s -> 8636.64s]  I'm not this game is fucking fun. Just this fish is stupid. Okay, don't worry
[8636.64s -> 8640.16s]  We're gonna get up the stupid mission and we're gonna go back to fucking full of grenades and people
[8641.08s -> 8654.74s]  Cars gonna drive by and I'm gonna get it's gonna hit me and I'm gonna go. Oh, I actually do want to see what else is in
[8654.74s -> 8660.53s]  The game. I'm having a lot of fun in this one. All right, I don't don't fuck. I have plenty of time
[8661.03s -> 8670.86s]  It's still challenge if I can do it. I would love to do it. I want to spend money to everything spent a dollar
[8671.40s -> 8687.39s]  It's definitely like a jetpack or something. I don't fuck Matt. The funniest part about the ratatouille game stream
[8688.07s -> 8694.45s]  Yeah, well, let's see. I bet you I bet you're like 3,000 or you don't even show up
[8694.89s -> 8707.75s]  It's like one of the lowest viewed streams in history
[8708.47s -> 8713.94s]  Play ratatouille do it, but he's actually playing ratatouille. Yeah
[8714.94s -> 8718.34s]  Oh, I got something else going on today. What's going on?
[8718.96s -> 8738.45s]  How do I get up there what the fuck wait
[8739.53s -> 8748.09s]  And then but I have to go back all the way around. I'm not gonna do this. It's gonna fail
[8748.73s -> 8756.89s]  Have nine seconds to go around the entire course. Oh my god
[8757.61s -> 8761.77s]  Why did I?
[8763.77s -> 8770.65s]  Know I'm gonna beat it. I don't care. No, no, no, no, no, I'm playing this. No, it's not gonna happen. I have
[8771.31s -> 8775.07s]  Okay
[8775.99s -> 8779.39s]  There is no next game it is only this game
[8779.91s -> 8796.00s]  Yeah, I'm not gonna quit. I am not gonna quit. I want you to remember who said that
[8796.60s -> 8803.18s]  All you that think I'm gonna quit it's not gonna happen. I'm gonna play this through until it I beat this
[8803.18s -> 8807.26s]  I'm not the whole game, but enough till I fly the helicopter into like the
[8808.32s -> 8809.40s]  car
[8809.40s -> 8820.65s]  You know, that's gonna be funny. It's good that way. I don't want to do this again. I don't want to do this again
[8820.79s -> 8822.79s]  I want to play the game
[8822.83s -> 8829.08s]  Don't fuck it up. Just do it. Normally you have plenty of time
[8829.80s -> 8846.72s]  Honey, helicopter bit people happy. Yeah
[8847.64s -> 8857.63s]  I might be able to get in like a plane
[8858.23s -> 8862.60s]  Like a boat too. I was in a boat in the beginning of the game. It's still more to see
[8863.12s -> 8884.84s]  Alright, stop this. Here we go playing minecraft after this. We're playing minecraft in like two weeks. Oh
[8885.64s -> 8897.89s]  Let them flip you
[8897.89s -> 8912.60s]  Yeah, FTK
[8912.62s -> 8917.66s]  I'll give you some updates on FTK. It is pretty much ready to go. We have to do some testing on it
[8918.22s -> 8921.70s]  Here are some of the things that are going to change. I'll tell you right now. You're ready
[8922.30s -> 8927.86s]  No aging system. No stamina. The goal of the game is not just to walk around with a stick and try to kill me
[8929.19s -> 8931.19s]  No more three months sub
[8932.27s -> 8935.35s]  Requirement because I wasn't streaming for two months. So that would be stupid to have that
[8935.87s -> 8939.59s]  You have to have been subbed when I wasn't streaming. No, you just have to be an active sub
[8940.13s -> 8943.65s]  It doesn't matter I don't think it matters if you're community sub or a regular sub doesn't matter
[8944.65s -> 8958.66s]  The food there's no food system. It's going to be a full-on adventure
[8959.26s -> 8961.26s]  We're gonna do with all of us together
[8961.58s -> 8967.22s]  Should be a lot of fun. The rules in the game system is completely changed
[8967.74s -> 8976.61s]  What's FTK? It is favor the king
[8977.33s -> 8992.88s]  Favor of the king you have to be a two-year sub, but I don't think there'd be very many people that be participating
[8993.40s -> 9008.24s]  Alright, this is it. This is the end
[9012.99s -> 9014.99s]  Don't flip over it at the very end, please

[9080.16s -> 9082.16s]  vision to have an end
[9083.32s -> 9090.93s]  I don't think this mission has an end come on dude I don't want to do this

[9162.20s -> 9170.87s]  it's been in a closet for too long that possible did I burn out the internal
[9170.87s -> 9195.30s]  battery that isn't the thing okay how old is it 25 years old or something my

[17253.72s -> 17260.68s]  We're trying this left bumper right bumper right bumper left bumper left bumper right bumper. It's hard to do that
[17261.22s -> 17265.68s]  Okay, there's more cheese is you're bad at the game. That's
[17267.18s -> 17270.78s]  Is that like an elite that that's like a cracked copy of the game
[17271.70s -> 17290.12s]  Don't want to download a cracked exe of the game any updates on the baseball stream. It has been postponed indefinitely
[17290.72s -> 17294.36s]  Until it is safer to do so it was going to be
[17295.36s -> 17298.96s]  like 40 people 50 people in the same spot
[17299.92s -> 17301.92s]  players crew

[17333.55s -> 17339.71s]  Be honest I haven't put very much time into that yet because it's such a daunting task at the moment that it's in the back
[17339.71s -> 17341.71s]  of my mind every day
[17353.46s -> 17355.54s]  He bought 20 webcams for nothing
[17356.40s -> 17367.20s]  Oh, but I'm just gonna sit in my closet. I'm gonna use them eventually protect the executive. This is a million dollars
[17369.28s -> 17373.25s]  Okay, one million dollars

[18578.06s -> 18580.43s]  years and years from now
[18581.87s -> 18589.60s]  Like six core eight core twelve core, that's crazy two CPUs and one motherboard that's insane
[18590.28s -> 18593.74s]  That shit will be in your brain
[18593.94s -> 18596.24s]  in like 50 years
[18596.36s -> 18612.44s]  Here we go. I just wait till they get out. There's really no sense in destroying the vehicles at all
[18613.06s -> 18635.88s]  It's just too much particle effects as it just ruins everything shoot the people good I would love to attack this guy
[18636.52s -> 18647.27s]  Let's get in the tank

[18783.24s -> 18790.35s]  Anti air kit. All right. What is it?
[18791.33s -> 18799.55s]  Anti-air missile that's to destroy. Okay, we're gonna lock on
[18800.09s -> 18813.84s]  Get out of here
[18813.84s -> 18858.06s]  Done anymore. I'm me in this shit. You missed that one. I want to do like a
[18858.92s -> 18870.94s]  Helicopter fight, but can I pick him up in this but that wasn't the building he was in right?
[18871.26s -> 18901.65s]  Can I pick this is so awkward to drive around him. I get it
[18901.65s -> 18912.89s]  I have to tell him to follow me. I follow follow follow follow follow, but is he piloting?
[18923.79s -> 18929.10s]  That's not an up building right

[18977.28s -> 19009.45s]  Where's this guy? Oh well destroy the building
[19009.97s -> 19015.14s]  Wish I had that missile. That'd be great. Just wait. Okay, see for wait
[19015.14s -> 19021.94s]  Wait, wait, wait see for on the building and then we get in and then I can detonate it, right?
[19021.94s -> 19029.10s]  Does that make sense finish the job first? Oh, right, right, right. You're right. Do the mission. Yeah, that's true
[19029.78s -> 19069.52s]  Dave helipads are for nerds
[19070.32s -> 19083.32s]  Helipads are for incredibly rich people. I mean you can be a nerd and be rich
[19083.80s -> 19088.73s]  But you got to be rich to have a helipad. That's just the way it is 2.4 mil

[19126.43s -> 19137.55s]  I made a video on it end of the stream voice. Not quite. No, not yet
[19138.05s -> 19153.44s]  But Desperados should be really fun. If if it's anything like Desperados 2 that was a lot of fun as well
[19158.28s -> 19170.42s]  UPHQ is in the northern part of the city. How high can I go?
[19171.94s -> 19173.94s]  Finish LA Noire
[19176.82s -> 19178.82s]  Three years ago

[19261.24s -> 19268.35s]  This is really far away shit
[19268.87s -> 19271.62s]  All the way at the top of the mountain
[19271.74s -> 19278.52s]  People who want Naughty Bear are the same people who want Ratatouille
[19278.52s -> 19284.28s]  They've wanted for the memes for like three minutes and then they leave when he actually plays the game
[19285.00s -> 19291.36s]  Yep
[19291.36s -> 19294.36s]  Sounds about right to me. All right, here we go

[20282.53s -> 20284.35s]  like I
[20284.35s -> 20293.27s]  Good grammar and spelling are important. But if you want to write essays that inspire
[20294.27s -> 20296.71s]  messages that forge brighter connections and
[20297.75s -> 20299.27s]  emails that
[20299.27s -> 20301.27s]  Get the job. All right
[20301.27s -> 20304.39s]  Here's the other me to tell you something about like grammarly, right?
[20304.59s -> 20309.83s]  We are just teaching people that they can just mash their keyboards, you know, you have to know how to spell anything
[20309.99s -> 20314.71s]  You don't even have to know when to do periods commas exclamation points never, you know, who cares
[20318.60s -> 20322.88s]  Eventually, we're gonna start you can start writing emotes and Grammarly is gonna write your essay for you
[20322.88s -> 20325.08s]  It's gonna be like German old German rats
[20326.08s -> 20338.50s]  Mugga ash Omega lol and it's gonna write is a fucking story for you. I don't fit the
[20339.14s -> 20371.20s]  What is that? I've played this game before it's terrible. It's just not it's so bad
[20371.56s -> 20376.44s]  What do you want? I that's not it. What do you walk around you like to attack? I it's not good
[20378.56s -> 20380.56s]  Although I didn't play the remakes
[20380.76s -> 20410.77s]  Hey guys, I deleted the browser source and I can't stop it
[20411.41s -> 20414.10s]  Isn't that interesting?
[20414.42s -> 20418.34s]  It's off. It's not here anymore. I cannot control it
[20419.02s -> 20421.14s]  Like I deleted it from the source. I
[20422.56s -> 20425.36s]  Don't know why it's still playing. It's not even here anymore
[20426.08s -> 20432.06s]  What do I do?
[20432.06s -> 20460.71s]  It's not on the screen. It's not even in my Grammarly does more than you Grammarly
[20464.41s -> 20466.41s]  It's the GTA radio
[20476.69s -> 20481.05s]  I know some of you guys think this is a joke or something. Oh, what a funny like bit he's doing
[20481.61s -> 20487.73s]  I've removed it from it's not up here. There's no capture source. It's not here
[20489.29s -> 20494.80s]  This is gonna knock this is gonna happen it until I hit the X on OBS
[20502.41s -> 20509.35s]  Because the better we all communicate the better we connect yeah, you have to prove it
[20510.03s -> 20511.15s]  Grammarly
[20511.15s -> 20512.91s]  Helping close the window
[20512.91s -> 20517.35s]  The window there is no window and download today. I don't have a window
[20517.91s -> 20550.24s]  Wait, I think I found it. Hold on. I got it. I got it. What are you linking me?
[20550.88s -> 20559.24s]  Yeah, I you know how times I've seen this image of me shibby and it's Alex and somebody writes something fucked up on my shirt
[20559.38s -> 20568.50s]  You either make me like five inches shorter put like a big pee stain on my pants. That was really nice
[20569.24s -> 20574.72s]  Look at like the oily pee pee stain. I remember that one. That was funny
[20575.44s -> 20588.68s]  Alright, I'm done. I'm I'll see you later. I'll see you later. That's it
[20588.68s -> 20606.23s]  I had a lot of fun, but I think it's time into the stream boys. Yeah
[20606.83s -> 20612.76s]  No stream tomorrow, by the way, I have doctor's stuff to do. I will not be around tomorrow
[20613.44s -> 20615.87s]  But I will be around Wednesday and Thursday
[20616.43s -> 20618.87s]  Wednesday and Thursday is probably gonna be Desperado's 3
[20619.59s -> 20623.11s]  That's gonna do custom robo as well
[20623.55s -> 20631.76s]  So Wednesday will be Desperado's 3 and then if the game sucks and game sucks will do something else
[20633.09s -> 20644.22s]  Eternal darkness I also have but that'll probably be October. Am I gonna finish mercenaries?
[20645.40s -> 20646.84s]  Probably not
[20646.84s -> 20652.65s]  Although this is this could be one of those now probably not. I think I've seen everything I wanted to see
[20653.17s -> 20658.78s]  What time PST on Wednesday probably around same time today?
[20659.96s -> 20666.04s]  fucking jump
[20666.08s -> 20671.92s]  Probably same time today around like 10 o'clock and 30 started 11 today because of the ps3 problems, but several like 1030
[20672.56s -> 20685.81s]  Am Pacific he's gonna run over by the boat. Wait, he's alive. I
[20699.32s -> 20701.32s]  Can't shoot through this glass
[20711.97s -> 20725.23s]  Well, I can't end the stream I can't stop I'm trying to stop
[20725.85s -> 20767.90s]  All right, I gotta go. I'm gone. I'm officially gone. See you later. This character is invincible
[20786.16s -> 20790.76s]  I can't stop playing. All right, I guess I'm gonna hit the button. Am I sad? No, what?
[20791.28s -> 20801.88s]  My sad
[20801.88s -> 20814.86s]  Why would I be sad? All right. I'll see you guys Wednesday. Take your buddy. Let's go
[20814.86s -> 20820.55s]  I got I got a pull it I got a pull the plug pull and plug but done
[20820.63s -> 20826.48s]  Hey, look at that plug has been pulled. That was fun
[20826.48s -> 20836.78s]  I just I couldn't stop but there was mercenaries to but exactly when I wanted out of this game and it is exactly what
[20836.78s -> 20842.16s]  I thought it was going to be I'll see you Wednesday
[20842.32s -> 20850.18s]  Thank you to all the community subs by the way speaking. I want to make sure I make this really clear. There is
[20850.86s -> 20855.12s]  No multi month sub that you need for FTK
[20855.46s -> 20861.41s]  The server is apparently going to be able to handle over the course of I believe it's six or seven different servers
[20861.97s -> 20864.84s]  Connected together somewhere around a thousand people
[20865.24s -> 20873.34s]  Now the people that can actually play in like the main game is somewhere around like two or three hundred maybe four hundred
[20873.74s -> 20880.31s]  Well, we made it differently this time when I say we I mean they
[20880.87s -> 20887.07s]  Where there's gonna be a lot of different like hub worlds connected for a queue system
[20887.39s -> 20891.47s]  So it's not just like the server gets fucking diarrhea don in
[20892.03s -> 20895.07s]  Ten seconds and there's 400 people and then the whole thing crashes
[20895.55s -> 20906.01s]  Top sub gifters to another this top sub gifter hasn't worked since I implemented this in stream labs OBS. It's just there
[20906.05s -> 20912.13s]  It's just those guys. It's a slug every time. It's the rich money guy in the middle and it's like the the metamorphosizing
[20913.33s -> 20922.77s]  Alien squid on the right. It's always these people every time what day you can do custom robo either Thursday or
[20923.49s -> 20930.69s]  Monday depends on how long desperado's is if I have fun in it, but let's run the credits
[20931.25s -> 20939.48s]  Hopefully this works because I'm testing a theory here. The theory is do I have to be on?
[20940.12s -> 20947.89s]  The stream labs page for it to work. Let's test it ready
[20951.43s -> 20967.50s]  Yep, the stream labs page has to be open and on my screen the whole time
[20967.86s -> 20971.50s]  That's new that I didn't need to do that before
[20972.06s -> 20981.91s]  Those are these I stopped streaming for two months and all these windows update makes a bunch of shitty updates gonna be one person
[20982.29s -> 20991.50s]  Stop using stream labs, you know, I wish I could but I've been so used to it for so long that
[20992.03s -> 21002.71s]  I don't want to relearn another system. Hey one guy nice job
[21003.37s -> 21007.68s]  Thanks for the subs everybody. I'm sorry you did I my theory is correct
[21012.06s -> 21015.46s]  Actually one guy his channel is dying sad face
[21016.76s -> 21023.67s]  During's been rough lately. No, we're good. Everything's fine. That could be one person and it would be alright. Don't worry
[21024.03s -> 21040.26s]  Have you seen totally accurate battlegrounds? Uh, I have I wanted to play it a long time ago, but if I was like
[21040.26s -> 21052.26s]  It's early access, right? Why is he so sad? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, stop. Stop it
[21052.74s -> 21055.74s]  You cut this out right now
[21055.82s -> 21066.27s]  But you're all gonna be in big trouble a lot of players recently. Maybe I'd play it. Alright guys, I'll see you Wednesday
[21066.71s -> 21068.71s]  Have a great rest of your night
[21070.59s -> 21072.19s]  Let's do a raid
[21072.19s -> 21073.75s]  If we're not ready in a long time
[21073.75s -> 21079.70s]  I want to try I want to try to cycle people like people that we haven't rated in a very well
[21079.70s -> 21081.70s]  We haven't rated or we haven't read in a very long time
[21082.30s -> 21097.61s]  Who's online at the moment? Let's take a look seeing a bunch of names
[21098.33s -> 21106.07s]  You know, let's let's write Kraken. It's been a long time since we've rated Kraken
[21106.47s -> 21111.61s]  In a while since I've talked to Kraken to it's been a few months
[21112.13s -> 21118.02s]  See how he's doing was he playing outward? Oh Kraken. I said hello
[21118.54s -> 21123.94s]  Enjoy yourselves if you feel like sticking around on a Kraken stream then go for it. If not, and we'll see you Wednesday
[21124.38s -> 21127.66s]  Are you gonna ever use channel points again? Yes
[21129.30s -> 21134.37s]  Eventually, there will be something else to do. I promise. All right. I see you guys later. See you Wednesday
[21134.37s -> 21136.37s]  Have a great rest of your
[21136.69s -> 21147.78s]  Next day or two. See you Wednesday for Desperado's 3 now get out of here scram. I think I spelled his name wrong
[21147.78s -> 21151.11s]  I didn't all right. Take care guys. See you soon
