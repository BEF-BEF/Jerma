[0.00s -> 12.85s]  Split. Well, um, I mean, yeah, I could have done that. You're right. You are. You are correct. I could have absolutely could have done that.
[43.74s -> 50.29s]  I can't tell if this is the beginning of the game or if this is I don't know. Is this the beginning of the game?
[53.95s -> 66.26s]  Does anybody know where's the oh, there it is. This is where I left off. All right, good
[68.10s -> 68.50s]  We did it
[68.50s -> 73.94s]  We did a little pivot to hit man and threw some grenades at people and I went back to the quiet man
[78.46s -> 85.68s]  I just backed up into that guy and I heard him. Is the audio yeah
[85.68s -> 88.72s]  We have to explain to everybody again that the audio is like all fucked up
[93.30s -> 98.50s]  Yeah, see we had two hours of quiet man and then two hours of hitman and then like now two hours of quiet man
[108.18s -> 110.50s]  No, this this sucked. You should play hitman again
[111.90s -> 113.90s]  YouTube auto
[114.54s -> 115.66s]  No
[115.66s -> 126.10s]  No, let's just get through this game. I can't believe i'm still watching this
[126.74s -> 129.04s]  Don't you want to see how it ends?
[129.04s -> 130.88s]  We need to see how this ends
[130.88s -> 139.58s]  I feel like I was just in like a time warp
[139.90s -> 142.83s]  I just had like a hitman dream for an hour and 40 minutes
[150.27s -> 153.71s]  Still says i'm playing hitman. Oh fuck. I got a chance. This guy's not even functioning
[154.67s -> 165.39s]  I should get the quiet man's haircut. I already had it. It was great
[170.13s -> 172.53s]  God damn it. Don't do this to me. No
[174.66s -> 177.30s]  Not now don't do this to me now. Don't do this to me now
[179.78s -> 189.82s]  Okay, I fixed him. They can't be more than like 30 minutes in this game, right? They can't be
[199.28s -> 202.48s]  Golden this did not win a golden joystick award. No way
[203.04s -> 208.59s]  It did not
[208.59s -> 211.60s]  It did not it did not
[212.08s -> 230.08s]  What do I have to do? Please consider using youtube autoplay
[234.51s -> 236.51s]  uh
[248.82s -> 264.02s]  No, I can't get up 18 percent liked this game
[265.47s -> 267.71s]  All right. Here's the question. Do you think the viewer is going to go up or down?
[268.35s -> 279.44s]  What do you think?
[279.44s -> 281.44s]  Your viewers are going to triple
[282.53s -> 284.53s]  Well, it's been going down
[286.54s -> 290.37s]  Uh
[290.37s -> 295.35s]  Hey, well, by the way, germany is this weekend if anyone was curious. Hope you have a happy thanksgiving
[296.05s -> 308.62s]  It still says hitman 2. Oh, hold on. Let me let me just change that real quick to the quiet man
[319.23s -> 322.99s]  All right, and then the I changed the title title that makes more sense now, too
[323.63s -> 337.20s]  What is this pause screen? It's it's absolute dog shit. I have no idea why it's like that
[337.92s -> 343.78s]  Yeah, we went back. Yeah, I we we did the we I need to see how the sense we have to be close to the end
[348.96s -> 350.24s]  Blow up this stuff
[350.24s -> 366.45s]  Is this shit?
[366.45s -> 369.70s]  We're almost there
[369.70s -> 371.62s]  There's quite a bit left
[371.62s -> 397.62s]  And they can't be don't worry the fact that here's the crazy part about this the fact that there's no
[398.82s -> 401.54s]  Not even any any audio besides these muffle punches
[403.33s -> 405.33s]  And they keep doing this overlay
[406.67s -> 410.91s]  Covering the whole screen superimposing images. We've seen a thousand times already
[413.89s -> 415.89s]  Why do you keep showing us this?
[416.45s -> 418.45s]  Why do you keep doing that?
[418.69s -> 435.71s]  No, it's gonna explode
[435.71s -> 438.11s]  It's deep you wouldn't you just wouldn't understand
[438.91s -> 445.31s]  Play vacuum cleaner noises
[448.38s -> 450.38s]  Um, am I about to turn on that? No
[452.46s -> 468.06s]  I already did this
[468.86s -> 472.48s]  How about we just like learn how to speak a different language? How does that sound?
[473.36s -> 475.36s]  Let's get like rosetta stone
[475.52s -> 483.84s]  Rosetta stone. Uh, what language do I want to learn? I'm gonna I'll have a
[486.96s -> 489.26s]  How to speak
[489.26s -> 491.12s]  um
[491.12s -> 498.74s]  I don't speak french
[498.74s -> 501.22s]  A language poll. Okay. Yeah, you know, it's a great idea
[501.70s -> 506.82s]  Let's let's see what language you guys want me to learn while we for the next hour
[514.99s -> 516.35s]  french
[516.35s -> 519.04s]  Uh latin
[519.68s -> 521.68s]  Got Chinese
[523.21s -> 525.47s]  Japanese
[525.47s -> 527.47s]  Uh spanish
[529.10s -> 531.47s]  um
[531.47s -> 534.61s]  english
[540.80s -> 542.80s]  Italian
[543.14s -> 545.14s]  Italian uh
[546.88s -> 548.75s]  Korean
[548.75s -> 557.95s]  french
[557.95s -> 562.88s]  Klingon
[564.93s -> 576.59s]  We can't put like, uh, what's the one from lord of the rings? What's the one from lord of the
[587.01s -> 589.01s]  This is making me laugh so hard
[596.88s -> 600.35s]  Okay
[600.35s -> 602.35s]  That's good, that's good, that's good
[603.39s -> 606.75s]  No, i'm not putting i'm not putting dothraki on here
[607.31s -> 609.31s]  Oh
[630.50s -> 651.09s]  Klingon korean you guys it's coming down to english or elvish
[654.99s -> 663.89s]  Uh
[663.89s -> 665.89s]  121 to 132
[670.19s -> 672.19s]  People are gonna get so confused
[672.35s -> 675.47s]  They're gonna come to the stream. They're gonna be like, why is he doing this? Just
[676.03s -> 684.02s]  Is there any reason why he's learning a language and playing this shitty game? All right, we got
[688.05s -> 691.73s]  All right, it's you got you got you get 60 seconds here
[696.02s -> 707.34s]  Now I think it's getting closed
[707.34s -> 709.34s]  Oh, man. All right
[711.73s -> 716.51s]  I think that's it
[716.51s -> 719.23s]  Yeah, it looks like it looks like we're gonna learn elvish
[719.79s -> 730.85s]  Uh, we can learn both
[730.85s -> 732.85s]  Let's learn elvish and then english
[734.86s -> 742.16s]  Okay, how thank you for voting polls close we're gonna do elvish in english how to speak elvish
[744.99s -> 746.99s]  Oh my god. Okay
[748.34s -> 750.74s]  Basic vowels learn to speak basic elvish
[751.46s -> 758.22s]  All right. This one is this video is basic
[758.94s -> 768.99s]  These are vowels
[768.99s -> 775.50s]  Let's see
[775.50s -> 779.25s]  Okay, let's give it a try i'm willing to learn
[783.68s -> 785.68s]  Okay, here we go
[787.26s -> 792.46s]  I thought that in my channel, you know, i've been using some elvish words and
[793.18s -> 799.02s]  Perhaps it's time that I actually tell you what they mean and teach you a little bit so that you understand
[799.18s -> 806.14s]  What I am saying when I do my videos, I guess I jumped right in thinking that most people who would find my channel
[806.14s -> 807.82s]  Would already know
[807.82s -> 809.58s]  But if you haven't
[809.58s -> 814.54s]  Discovered elvish language then I will teach you a little bit. That's what we're here for
[816.86s -> 818.86s]  So let's start at the very beginning
[820.78s -> 823.58s]  So what you have to know is that the vowel sounds
[824.86s -> 830.30s]  Um sound so the a e i o u and then that will allow you to be able to pronounce words
[831.02s -> 836.22s]  So for a's it's always a long a so it has the sound of
[836.46s -> 838.46s]  Ah
[842.30s -> 846.62s]  So whenever you see a word that has a in it you can sound it out by using ah
[848.06s -> 849.98s]  So a is a
[849.98s -> 853.34s]  Next vowel we have is e and it's always a short e
[853.98s -> 855.82s]  and the word
[855.82s -> 858.62s]  The word that you can think of to get that sound is
[859.90s -> 863.26s]  Elephant or so l e is l so it's that
[863.50s -> 864.70s]  L
[864.70s -> 870.54s]  And if you don't know what a long and short vowel is, um, the long makes that long face. Ah
[871.42s -> 873.02s]  short is
[873.02s -> 876.86s]  And you can tell the difference in the way that you position your mouth. Okay, so
[878.22s -> 881.02s]  So everything is a and ah so far
[881.82s -> 887.74s]  And then the next vowel is i and that is a short i so it has that so it has
[887.90s -> 889.90s]  In
[892.22s -> 894.22s]  So i is
[895.58s -> 899.02s]  The i sound like that so if you find a word
[900.14s -> 908.14s]  Like mean mean lots of different, uh words actually have i's in them and so you're always going to have that short i
[908.86s -> 910.38s]  sound
[910.38s -> 912.38s]  Then the next vowel is o
[918.14s -> 920.14s]  Octopus
[921.02s -> 923.02s]  And then we have
[923.42s -> 926.86s]  You i'm not the birds. I don't have a bird here
[927.98s -> 929.98s]  Unicorn and glue glue
[931.34s -> 935.34s]  So it's always like a kind of sound you you you
[944.14s -> 947.10s]  So hopefully that will that's actually very informative
[947.74s -> 951.26s]  Announcing some of the elvish words and names
[952.06s -> 956.86s]  Okay, so let's start out with the very first thing that I always say in my videos, which is
[958.86s -> 960.86s]  My
[964.30s -> 967.42s]  Which means well met my friend sometimes I just say my
[970.46s -> 975.26s]  Friend but if you put that wait, I missed a reveal. This is a big reveal. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[975.42s -> 976.54s]  I missed it
[976.54s -> 978.61s]  My my
[978.61s -> 982.53s]  It's that ah sound so you always want to end that word with an ah, so
[987.17s -> 991.25s]  But it's that e so together it's my my
[996.93s -> 1000.45s]  So just let it flow from your mouth, okay very very
[1002.61s -> 1004.61s]  Is that octopus sound and then
[1006.93s -> 1008.93s]  Try it with me
[1011.57s -> 1012.85s]  Very fast
[1012.85s -> 1017.57s]  Why is the game teaching us elvish and this is all third age
[1018.61s -> 1024.61s]  Elvish language. This is uh cinderella. So this is all of the walk in a corner, uh type of
[1025.57s -> 1029.49s]  Uh pronunciations that you would listen to in the lord of the rings
[1030.29s -> 1034.21s]  So this is all last stage lord of the rings all of the trilogy
[1034.37s -> 1040.69s]  This is this is the language that they use because there's a lot of different types of languages quinnia and there's uh,
[1041.41s -> 1047.81s]  The um cinderan can you believe that there's entire languages based on this game languages, but not this game
[1048.53s -> 1052.69s]  It's easier to research the ones that you find in the movie
[1053.09s -> 1057.57s]  But it's just really beautiful when you speak it. It's really fun when you start to do it
[1057.57s -> 1060.05s]  So just let that flow really easily
[1060.85s -> 1062.85s]  Okay
[1062.85s -> 1069.09s]  The next one one that I use a lot is hello or hi this quick reading is
[1069.65s -> 1073.01s]  Then do then do let's say say hello then do
[1073.71s -> 1075.71s]  Uniform that then do
[1076.61s -> 1078.61s]  Then do then do
[1079.17s -> 1080.69s]  very simple
[1080.69s -> 1083.41s]  The eh is that short e so that do
[1084.21s -> 1086.21s]  then do
[1086.93s -> 1088.93s]  And that just means hello
[1090.05s -> 1092.05s]  Use some times is
[1094.13s -> 1097.49s]  And it's just like that you pronounce the unicorn so
[1100.77s -> 1103.89s]  Ah that open a like father that's reading
[1117.18s -> 1119.18s]  Is another way that you can greet
[1119.34s -> 1122.14s]  I greet you. So this is another way to greet. Oh my fucking god
[1123.26s -> 1125.26s]  We sweet then I greet you
[1128.38s -> 1129.58s]  I greet you
[1129.58s -> 1134.22s]  Okay, so those are very basic basic things you can say when you meet somebody then
[1134.86s -> 1137.10s]  I will use these as good if I
[1137.74s -> 1139.82s]  So let's start out with the one that you
[1151.04s -> 1156.40s]  If you write anything on your computer, you need to get grammarly. I don't know. Don't get grammarly
[1157.36s -> 1163.68s]  Did he actually miss
[1169.74s -> 1171.18s]  At home
[1171.18s -> 1174.00s]  One where is jane?
[1174.40s -> 1179.04s]  She is in the living room jane's and what is she doing? She is playing the piano
[1179.60s -> 1181.20s]  Where is the car?
[1181.20s -> 1183.92s]  It is in the garage. Where is the dog?
[1184.56s -> 1190.08s]  The dog is too fast for me. This is basic english doing the dog is eating
[1192.27s -> 1193.63s]  At home
[1193.63s -> 1195.39s]  one
[1195.39s -> 1196.83s]  Where is jane?
[1196.83s -> 1201.47s]  She is in the living room. What is she doing? She is playing the piano
[1202.03s -> 1206.35s]  Where is the car? It is in the garage. Where is the dog?
[1206.99s -> 1208.99s]  The dog is in front of the door
[1209.55s -> 1212.67s]  What is the dog? This is an hour and 20 minutes
[1213.47s -> 1216.53s]  at the restaurant
[1216.53s -> 1221.73s]  This is a big menu. Yeah, what are you getting chicken peas and baked potatoes?
[1221.89s -> 1227.01s]  I don't know what to get. What a terrible fucking restaurant. I had turkey yesterday. How about steak?
[1227.33s -> 1233.09s]  Perfect. I'll get steak and mashed potatoes. What vegetable are you getting? I'm not getting any. I don't like vegetables
[1234.61s -> 1236.61s]  When's the baby due?

[3328.59s -> 3339.60s]  right we can do it we can do it what the hell are you doing down here dad maybe 20 30
[3339.60s -> 3352.37s]  we can do it here's the second to last boss one guy no there's no way there was a huge
[3352.37s -> 3356.37s]  reveal that these people that i didn't care about in the beginning are people that i still
[3356.37s -> 3360.85s]  don't care about in the end and they double crossed me for somehow through the beginning
[3360.85s -> 3364.62s]  of the game i don't remember what they double crossed me on it or they did it though somebody
[3364.62s -> 3376.08s]  was talking like baby talk it was an english uh tutorial that's all i remember because this is
[3376.08s -> 3403.14s]  one of the main characters here all right come on you can two drunk guys fighting
[3403.14s -> 3414.11s]  that's why did i go through him am i even connecting shots on this guy i don't think i
[3414.11s -> 3429.90s]  am i'm punching him and it's hurting me and there actually is no sun okay there we go i mean
[3429.90s -> 3463.34s]  that's a great idea hey google show can be dangerous nothing the history out the window
[3463.34s -> 3466.82s]  this is going to be different this is going to be unique
[3467.78s -> 3469.54s]  i'm scared
[3471.62s -> 3479.41s]  there he is
[3494.48s -> 3498.99s]  it worked
[3498.99s -> 3501.71s]  this match is officially underway i never heard the bell ring
[3501.79s -> 3512.53s]  they never got the door locked and cain why did i just lose that quickly this is like playing a
[3512.53s -> 3516.13s]  game on a school night and having the sound muted so your parents don't know you're still up yes
[3516.93s -> 3531.89s]  okay now the door is locked finally back into the cell and it's cain who goes on the offense
[3531.89s -> 3537.73s]  early and perhaps this is no accident understanding what the
[3538.53s -> 3547.06s]  lockers maneuvers like that 20 years of destruction for the undertaker looking to
[3547.06s -> 3554.10s]  continue it tonight and locking the door now these two oh the door is locked caged inside
[3554.10s -> 3560.59s]  hell in a cell and let's not forget cain did to the undertaker back and that just started
[3561.55s -> 3562.91s]  oh come on no
[3566.99s -> 3568.19s]  here's some destruction
[3576.19s -> 3577.87s]  a weakness in his brother the undertaker when the
[3577.87s -> 3581.39s]  undertaker showed some type of compassion to sean michaels at wrestlemania
[3588.74s -> 3591.70s]  and again this is a different undertaker that we've witnessed
[3592.98s -> 3598.98s]  there's a couple of weeks ago snake eyes vintage undertaker as he takes cain down
[3602.66s -> 3610.21s]  vintage under day oh there's down in a kick out a quick backstory paul bearer had
[3610.21s -> 3616.99s]  an affair with a woman in the bowels of the funeral home wait what was the dvc oh right cain
[3617.79s -> 3622.24s]  they're takering yeah knocked down to his knees after that punch
[3623.28s -> 3630.24s]  1990 look at cain now with the chair look at the chair oh i don't have a chair don't lose
[3630.24s -> 3634.64s]  here but let's humanize this for a moment i mean if the undertaker has ever come to
[3634.64s -> 3640.21s]  really fitting in a being of the flesh i may attempt that that humanity was revealed to be
[3640.21s -> 3647.04s]  a lie undertaker and he can't humanize under one of these individuals
[3648.56s -> 3654.70s]  demon a monster admittedly so cain has lived in his better more celebrated brother's shadow
[3654.70s -> 3663.42s]  for years that's what this is all about the father of destruction looking on man who please
[3671.70s -> 3672.58s]  what the fuck
[3672.98s -> 3681.31s]  gravitate back to paul bearer where the fuck am i the fact that the world's heavyweight
[3681.31s -> 3685.79s]  championship an accolade that transcends time the same way these two once in a lifetime
[3685.79s -> 3694.45s]  superstars will do is hanging in the balance tonight somebody just threw something at the door
[3695.17s -> 3706.05s]  under punishing a champion came in the early going got it placing cain's skull hanging over
[3706.05s -> 3710.37s]  the steel steps that are going to the poop by the undertaker the undertaker will use these
[3710.37s -> 3715.09s]  tools of destruction like no one else has ever been able to utilize such carnage
[3722.77s -> 3723.97s]  which one is the undertaker
[3728.51s -> 3735.78s]  it's now 20 feet high and this in perspective this is the 11th time
[3735.78s -> 3740.90s]  undertakers participated in this matchup the closest individual to him triple h
[3741.46s -> 3747.94s]  he's been involved in he broke him through the cell he wins my hallway
[3767.60s -> 3772.86s]  oh i can't take it anymore hey does anyone have a charger
[3772.86s -> 3907.10s]  here
[3945.41s -> 3991.34s]  oh no we're gonna wait for what's even going on keep it going
[3998.69s -> 4049.12s]  ah no no this is what happened this is a shit this whole stream is a shitpost
[4049.12s -> 4058.37s]  it just it is i've come to terms with that it just has been the whole time
[4058.93s -> 4084.13s]  that has not stopped for about five hours embracing it you have to embrace it

[4258.38s -> 4281.92s]  game that was a huge boot where's that the whole game trapped here only five more out no
[4281.92s -> 4297.76s]  this game is over in 10 minutes probably i'm in slow motion get out of that slow motion man
[4297.76s -> 4328.80s]  come on really oh um remember to punch the guy in the balls you can't do that did i make this
[4329.44s -> 4340.64s]  you know what i mean i know you did you did right yeah i did okay you did i just was checking
[4341.44s -> 4360.51s]  i just i forgot i didn't know if i did or not i went like a countdown timer when the game is
[4360.51s -> 4382.21s]  over so i don't what the fuck am i doing that was a nice double kick no here comes another
[4382.21s -> 4398.32s]  five people i just asked a chat to count oh god that was a mistake i'm so sorry
[4403.38s -> 4408.43s]  i can't lose here though i don't want to do this again this is still coming in here
[4409.15s -> 4424.19s]  i mean what why make it that's just the same it's the same combo every time too
[4425.81s -> 4436.86s]  every single time nobody looked at it and said hey maybe we shouldn't just have the same
[4436.94s -> 4444.72s]  room and same combo you took out that center divider so now you have 25 more cooking area
[4448.77s -> 4452.21s]  so you can cook a lot of different things exactly right like how about pizza
[4456.43s -> 4467.97s]  it makes the best pizza i've ever had now this is my almost instant pizza dough and the
[4468.61s -> 4472.58s]  recipe comes with it all you have to just pop it in there and then put whatever toppings
[4472.58s -> 4477.38s]  you like it's a personal pizza so you don't have to wait for the delivery man pay extra
[4477.38s -> 4482.02s]  for all the toppings no tip for the driver either exactly now this is that reduced fat
[4482.02s -> 4485.86s]  turkey pepperoni you'll never tell the difference except it's not so greasy

[5613.42s -> 5626.45s]  did i ever have control i'm not sure i don't think i did we already saw him without the
[5626.45s -> 5631.33s]  mask this reveal doesn't make any sense now this is is it like a twin it's a twin
[5631.33s -> 5640.22s]  situation right twin brothers one of them was evil and wore a mask and the other one was
[5640.22s -> 5648.05s]  putting the mask on to try to this two it's twin brothers see watch here comes a twin i called it
[5648.05s -> 5671.42s]  i fucking win i win i win here comes the twin brother no it's a dad why does everybody have
[5671.42s -> 5682.48s]  this mask i don't is this like the mask with jim carrey this thing just makes you go crazy
[5682.48s -> 5686.40s]  it brings out the worst or the most the most mischievous of people i don't understand
[5687.92s -> 5718.13s]  why wear it do i have to play as did you really just do like the rock
[5757.74s -> 5762.29s]  give him the people's elbow i'll try but i'm he's the rock i'm not the rock
[5772.56s -> 5785.95s]  all right i got it i got the people's elbow oh dad you suck oh that was a nice slide
[5786.67s -> 5810.70s]  does anyone want to watch all the dialogue of the game at like times 20 speed so we can just
[5810.70s -> 5826.94s]  figure out what happened just like yeah sure we could figure out what happened i'm not i don't
[5826.94s -> 5834.69s]  think it's impossible got it with a drop kick yeah that was pretty good oh we're in the hell
[5834.69s -> 5852.45s]  in a cell right here oh right up against the cage new game plus has dialogue but why would
[5852.45s -> 5860.59s]  you want to play through this whole thing again like the video game itself is just is just awful
[5860.59s -> 5866.48s]  right if the story was good you don't really you don't want to play through this again
[5869.28s -> 5873.44s]  if the game was a little bit more fun maybe but okay you could you could have a really
[5873.44s -> 5876.48s]  interesting story well though you have to play through the whole game and then play through it
[5876.48s -> 5882.37s]  again to be able to hear everything but like the the fighting has just been the same two
[5882.37s -> 5890.99s]  combos why are we doing like the dragon ball z we both fought for five minutes now we're
[5890.99s -> 5900.61s]  gonna have dialogue sequence they really are doing that it's like a smash brothers trailer
[5900.61s -> 5930.66s]  what the hell was that oh the double knockout the double knockout who is this they're not
[5930.66s -> 5934.66s]  she's not going to come over and put the mask on right is that like a who is this is that
[5934.66s -> 5944.45s]  the girl that was just standing there if she puts the mask on and i have to fight this girl
[5945.01s -> 5965.79s]  she's gonna be naked don't be naked don't go all the way here and just and be naked
[5965.79s -> 5995.78s]  or something don't do that i'm gonna do my best i'm gonna do my best to lip sync it
[5996.82s -> 5997.62s]  to the lip match
[6031.50s -> 6035.34s]  no you're ruining my immersion i don't want to hear it i've been so used to not hearing it i
[6035.34s -> 6069.04s]  don't want to hear it we're here for the ending credits we have to see it sing it
[6096.43s -> 6099.01s]  stars
[6103.17s -> 6108.77s]  this is one of those movies that you go see with a group of people
[6110.21s -> 6116.66s]  and you spend the money on it and then the car rider you walk out you know the movie ends
[6116.66s -> 6122.74s]  the credit okay everyone gets up silent on the way out you get in the car doors close close
[6122.74s -> 6130.06s]  close that's like four of you nobody talks it's dead silent and finally somebody's just like
[6130.94s -> 6140.05s]  so was the was the son the bad guy or was the mom and it was i don't i don't know man that was
[6140.05s -> 6150.78s]  whatever like nobody has any fucking idea it's in it's quiet for like 15 to 20 minutes until
[6150.78s -> 6158.69s]  somebody decides to bring it up because you all paid for it and you and you spent time there
[6158.69s -> 6162.45s]  you know what i mean yeah it was like a two or three hour movie nobody wants to admit that
[6162.45s -> 6170.42s]  that was a bad idea oh wow we all just wasted our evening no nobody what no so let me like
[6170.42s -> 6195.87s]  let me get this straight dude get rid of the whole beginning part and give me the
[6195.87s -> 6200.94s]  give me like the electric bird man stuff with all those cool moves
[6200.94s -> 6240.93s]  to two twins it's about twins it takes to make the break to show the twins on screen
[6241.73s -> 6267.94s]  don't even give me this bullshit it's this over 3000 people here 40 of you at least
[6268.90s -> 6271.86s]  are like actually kind of like this you're gonna add this to your playlist when you're
[6271.86s -> 6289.60s]  working out yes you will not a bad song see what's it called in the time that it takes
[6289.60s -> 6314.56s]  to show the twins on screen is that what it's called after you always stay for the after
[6314.56s -> 6324.13s]  infinity war credits push her off and this would be of two letter grades higher oh well here
[6324.13s -> 6331.84s]  comes another person to put on the bird mask is it dad again there's dad again dad's back
[6332.80s -> 6335.25s]  dad got up and
[6349.26s -> 6360.18s]  i want the main character to have a really really absurd voice
[6360.18s -> 6367.12s]  you is also what's happening to me like shut up idiot you're blinded by grief
[6368.80s -> 6373.28s]  me by ambition why is it so compressed audio
[6382.59s -> 6383.09s]  yeah
[6388.66s -> 6404.24s]  homeroom 201 it is the greatest performance of my career the night i was kidnapped
[6408.08s -> 6419.58s]  and the time that it takes you put songs of the world the time that it takes
[6436.94s -> 6449.02s]  one two three four one two three four one two three four 10 20 23 24 uh 50 49 cents
[6449.98s -> 6457.71s]  40 no 40 yeah 49 cents got it don't you just fucking hate the rumble feature
[6457.71s -> 6459.55s]  on controllers i wish they would just not do it anymore
[6459.63s -> 6463.14s]  uh
[6465.46s -> 6476.77s]  what the hell am i supposed to press a button it's not most people would have hung up by then

[6524.42s -> 6532.05s]  answer your questions here as the game plays again so we decided to put uh the game in
[6532.05s -> 6536.45s]  reverse have you seen memento uh that goes in reverse too spoiler i mean it's a great
[6536.45s -> 6568.77s]  movie how do i turn it on didn't say it was in the options
[6569.33s -> 6622.43s]  yeah that is that really is a 2006 dvd menu i just want to see i'm curious got to change the
[6622.43s -> 6636.78s]  stream name instead of the quiet man the i can hear you now man the audible man loud man
[6646.05s -> 6662.99s]  the man just the man a man a man in the world let's see what i say here didn't we hear this
[6662.99s -> 6668.43s]  guy this is what this game makes no sense this guy we heard him in the beginning we heard this
[6668.43s -> 6676.86s]  shit before he see he talks why did halfway through the game we just we couldn't hear
[6676.86s -> 6694.59s]  anymore see why were we able to hear him do that but then 30 40 minutes later it's just
[6694.59s -> 6710.66s]  muffled sounds all right where's the scene that we need context you know what i mean
[6712.13s -> 6726.46s]  oh i can't i can't just skip all of them this is no sound though all right let's just
[6726.46s -> 6745.74s]  press let's get it over with yeah i couldn't use the top one separate progress yeah okay hold on
[6746.30s -> 6755.36s]  too late for a refund yeah that's all right i had a good time listening to music and putting
[6755.36s -> 6762.38s]  fucking weird sound effects over my stream we were all just sitting in a room and i was
[6762.38s -> 6770.64s]  pressing buttons and loud sounds and music was coming out i may as well just had a black
[6770.64s -> 6779.92s]  screen you know it gets to a point when you start to play the ed ed and eddie theme song
[6779.92s -> 6786.64s]  and then put and then a portion of an entire episode yeah it's you've lost control completely
[6786.64s -> 6793.18s]  and it's like the stream's off the rails i suppose keep the screen here
[6801.63s -> 6806.67s]  and it was that was a weird stream we started on this and then it got voted off the island
[6807.39s -> 6816.38s]  i got angry at my computer i i blew up a guy in hitman and then we went back and finished
[6822.03s -> 6829.15s]  that was this was very odd but uh i am not streaming tomorrow it's thanksgiving tomorrow

[6890.16s -> 6902.00s]  mashed together but let's uh get to the bits and then the credits take care hope you had fun
[6902.00s -> 6906.00s]  i i mean weirdly enough i had like i had fun pretty much the entire stream i thought that

[6911.76s -> 6932.13s]  great quiet man in germania yeah probably i don't see why not i'm gonna have to mute

[6984.99s -> 6992.83s]  uh as you saw during this stream sometimes computer problems and graphics and drivers and cpu i don't
[6992.83s -> 6999.22s]  have no idea what's going on with hitman but it just happens and you just kind of have to
[6999.22s -> 7008.58s]  try to figure it out on the fly or it's part it's part of the gig so i wish you luck

[7161.07s -> 7165.55s]  he would have to do is plug his ears and blow out as hard as he could and steam would come
[7165.55s -> 7169.15s]  out of his nose and melt the bars and he would walk out it's the cartoon comedy land you can

[7295.58s -> 7302.11s]  except for that one but that's that was just a little joystick one what i'm sorry so i did
[7302.11s -> 7315.79s]  95 percent of them on stream i did all of them except for the plain joystick fraud fraud fraud
[7316.59s -> 7321.23s]  it's outright didn't i guess tell you that 80 percent of the things i say are not true
[7326.50s -> 7331.22s]  thank you uh d jack for the one dollar hitman would be a much better game if the guy was deaf
[7331.22s -> 7339.50s]  and there was no sound i gotta figure out what the hell is going on with my cpu i might like
[7339.50s -> 7343.74s]  flash my bios or something because that made no sense because it wasn't just the fact that
[7343.74s -> 7348.86s]  the game was slowing down i was getting encoding errors on obs and i haven't had one of those
[7348.86s -> 7358.80s]  in at least two three years in my reading chat yeah i reach out all the time in fact probably
[7358.80s -> 7370.32s]  too much to my own detriment sometime uh thank you bro luck for the one dollar germ i just
[7370.32s -> 7382.58s]  realized uh your country has guns and like hitman or you mean like like the united states
[7388.69s -> 7401.10s]  yeah i mean that's accurate yeah make sure it's not just the game before you go yeah
[7401.10s -> 7407.09s]  that's true i don't know i'll do some tests because that was really weird if my cpu went
[7407.09s -> 7413.49s]  up to 90 percent when i installed that new driver that was very concerning that's why
[7413.49s -> 7416.37s]  i had to get out of there and i had to go i had to get out of there right now you know
[7416.37s -> 7426.74s]  what i mean i had to go i'll do a bench and just make sure everything's fine i wasn't even
[7426.74s -> 7434.43s]  kidding it's true but thank you uh thank you d jack again for the one dollar hitman is too

[8285.76s -> 8289.36s]  playing epic music in the back was the only thing that makes this game engaging and entertaining
[8289.36s -> 8293.44s]  really proves that it was stupid to take the audio out in the first place especially when it
[8293.44s -> 8297.47s]  doesn't have a real purpose for the story. i think it's just they want you to play the
[8297.47s -> 8306.75s]  whole game again. but yes i don't i don't understand either. uh valuki thanks for the
[8306.75s -> 8310.99s]  one dollar. you should have used acid bass for that final fight but acid bass didn't make it

[8543.15s -> 8546.67s]  of a lot of people. i honestly have no idea what the story was or anything. i feel like
[8546.67s -> 8550.75s]  i saw the last episode of some anime without watching any of the previous episodes.
[8550.75s -> 8555.15s]  but with all the funny bits you really kept the ball rolling. i'm honestly glad this game exists
[8555.15s -> 8558.91s]  because if it didn't then this stream wouldn't have happened. have a wonderful thanksgiving
[8558.91s -> 8567.92s]  take care. thank you. thank you so much you as well. i'm glad we could turn it a cinnamon dog

[8575.17s -> 8585.79s]  you as well. celebrated. thank you dr clay. thank you to albob. thank you albo or albob
[8586.35s -> 8589.23s]  for the one dollar. hey germo i know a lot of people say these kind of things
[8589.23s -> 8592.11s]  but i've been watching you for at least six years now and you're easily my favorite
[8592.11s -> 8595.47s]  content creator on the internet. i love everything you've done and you never cease to
[8595.47s -> 8599.15s]  amaze me with the things that you come up with. you've done so much for me mentally i
[8599.15s -> 8602.91s]  can't even begin on it. i even think you're too good to be true because of how many
[8602.91s -> 8609.55s]  idiots are out there. so hope you don't accidentally say something very bad one day or something.
[8613.44s -> 8628.10s]  no. no. i'm a what you see is what you get kind of person and i mean i'm just me.
[8638.62s -> 8643.02s]  bass is the worst instrument. but that was just an 85% cinnamon dog piss joke.
[8643.58s -> 8663.02s]  i just do this because i don't have any like ulterior motives or anything. i don't want to
[8664.19s -> 8670.21s]  you know sell you guys something or try to do something that i'm not capable of or
[8671.17s -> 8676.13s]  put on some kind of persona that's not real. i mean i'm like i'm like this in fucking real
[8676.13s -> 8685.84s]  life. ask anybody that i know that you know i'm i this is just i don't i it's exhausting
[8685.84s -> 8693.34s]  to put on like a personality or pretend to be somebody it is it is absolutely exhausting and
[8693.34s -> 8700.78s]  i do not envy people that do that because you end up having to put on a face and pretend so
[8700.78s -> 8707.81s]  often and so long that you have to it's it's it's step one to everything you do and say
[8711.89s -> 8718.22s]  he randomly uses his tuber voice it's kind of but like also remember i mean i am speaking
[8718.22s -> 8728.18s]  into a microphone right so i i wanted to so i guess it's impossible to 100% be the exact same
[8728.18s -> 8732.18s]  person that you are in reality because i have a microphone here and i want to make sure you can
[8732.18s -> 8737.06s]  hear it and and i'm i have audio set up and is being recorded you know obviously i'm
[8738.02s -> 8752.10s]  try to be as real as i can but no i don't i don't think you have to worry about me
[8753.81s -> 8765.17s]  trying to like put on a face or act in a different way i just hope that you still
[8765.17s -> 8771.25s]  think it's fun to be here i mean that that's the you know think about as a viewer right
[8771.25s -> 8776.13s]  some of you guys have been here for a very long time and yeah i mean yeah sometimes we kind
[8776.13s -> 8782.78s]  of i could see how some people after a while could be like oh it's it's germa again it's

[9091.87s -> 9096.03s]  you lost from restarting your computer but if you don't want to if you were in the new super
[9096.03s -> 9104.70s]  spash brothers game what would be your special moves um i mean it would just be every single
[9104.70s -> 9110.54s]  direction like my let my side be my up be down be would just be the power of the sun
[9110.54s -> 9117.66s]  in a 600 foot long beam in every direction you just press side b and it would do like 40
[9117.66s -> 9124.19s]  damaged uh per tick you can just fill the whole screen and no one would ever touch me and i'd
[9124.19s -> 9142.21s]  win every time that's op yeah it is you think they're gonna patch it nope so guys bayonetta
[9142.93s -> 9149.76s]  was was impossible to play and play against bayonetta for the wii u version just beat
[9149.84s -> 9157.55s]  everybody and she was like an s plus plus plus plus tier you know the guy you know the guy read
[9157.55s -> 9170.74s]  the papers they're like i pay attention to the papers i wonder what they are gonna do though
[9170.74s -> 9175.30s]  because nintendo does not really at all like to patch games and fighting games in general
[9175.30s -> 9185.44s]  they kind of require balance updates don't they i wonder if they're gonna do that did they
[9185.44s -> 9195.63s]  actually patch uh smash wii u and do balance updates and everything they did have a patch
[9195.63s -> 9208.74s]  cycle no they patched it twice well ah there's almost 100 characters this time i'm sure there'll
[9208.74s -> 9213.22s]  be those i'm sure they'll be like the five to ten characters because when you make that
[9213.22s -> 9219.09s]  many characters it's like a moba you know all right welcome to league of legends there are
[9219.09s -> 9226.21s]  180 characters in this game but only play four of them five of them that are really worth
[9226.29s -> 9236.35s]  your time maybe seven of them out of the almost 200 characters in league how many of them are
[9236.35s -> 9241.55s]  actually worth going into lane with is it am i wrong saying that's like probably 20 characters
[9241.55s -> 9267.60s]  out of like a hundred and thousand about 50 about 30 how many are in the game 15 unless
[9267.60s -> 9279.44s]  you can one trick certain ones they're like 200 characters in league most of them are
[9279.44s -> 9289.17s]  actually played now really i remember hearing about people talk about uh it was there was i
[9289.17s -> 9296.13s]  mean maybe it's the game has changed or the better i don't know if you're bad at it like
[9296.13s -> 9304.02s]  me you can play whatever you want yeah you've even games like overwatch and that game had far
[9304.02s -> 9309.14s]  less characters a while ago wasn't there was the same two teams facing each other
[9318.29s -> 9325.36s]  overwatch meta l u l i haven't played it in a long time so i'm obviously speaking from
[9325.36s -> 9353.34s]  total ignorance but just play tanks i've seen a lot of people upset at that game but it's all
[9353.34s -> 9359.18s]  good as long as you're having fun playing a game then i'm glad you're having fun i'm not going
[9359.18s -> 9362.86s]  to be one of those people that's like well you know the thing is about league and dota
[9362.86s -> 9367.18s]  and think about uh smite and overwatch let me tell you whatever if you're having fun then

[9714.99s -> 9722.13s]  i could give you but be in front of a camera you treat the camera like uh it's somebody you
[9722.13s -> 9730.94s]  want to talk to because you do you know the camera is an extension of of people's eyes
[9732.32s -> 9737.66s]  and i've always just kind of treated the camera like a friend you know somebody that i want to
[9737.66s -> 9741.66s]  talk to because i do want to talk and i do want to talk to it so you can kind of imagine
[9741.66s -> 9746.58s]  that the camera is actually a person that you're hanging out with and it's not that far
[9746.58s -> 9763.84s]  from the truth give it a try camera's a friend except cameras don't want to talk to you
[9764.16s -> 9775.07s]  yeah but the the camera is not a doesn't have a mouth that has eyes but hopefully the good that
[9775.07s -> 9782.03s]  helps you out good luck in the good luck in the tournament hopefully you do well don't know
